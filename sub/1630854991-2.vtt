WEBVTT

00:00.840 --> 00:01.400
getting up to 16 .
That's

00:01.680 --> 00:04.120
Nuray: My family has lost
their only boy.

00:04.360 --> 00:06.120
How do you make amends
for that?

00:06.360 --> 00:08.600
Why come here if you're
not going to negotiate?

00:08.800 --> 00:11.600
To discuss Eamon Cunningham's
death to my family.

00:11.840 --> 00:14.440
He owed my father
almost $70 million.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.120
The debt is now yours.

00:16.320 --> 00:18.040
This is bollocks.

00:18.280 --> 00:20.160
We're still paying them
a fuckin' fortune.

00:20.400 --> 00:22.320
Why do you think the Batuks
even agreed to meet us?

00:22.560 --> 00:24.040
Because we already
paid them $2 million.

00:24.280 --> 00:25.280
You just wait.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.080
Kem.
Whistles

00:28.240 --> 00:30.120
But look, I need
three or four lads

00:30.280 --> 00:31.400
you can vouch for,
straight away.

00:31.560 --> 00:32.760
Amanda know about this?

00:32.920 --> 00:34.200
Fuck Amanda.

00:34.440 --> 00:36.040
There's big changes
coming to this family.

00:36.280 --> 00:37.800
She's the first
to get the fucking heave.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.560
Amanda: So, can you --
can you see the heartbeat?

00:39.760 --> 00:42.000
##

00:42.240 --> 00:43.880
But what do you do
to the baby?

00:44.080 --> 00:48.400
8, 7, 6, 5...

00:48.600 --> 00:51.560
You're just out, Eric.
Don't go doing anything stupid.

00:51.760 --> 00:52.920
Not me.

00:53.160 --> 00:55.000
Someone else is
gonna sort her out.

00:55.200 --> 00:59.000
I'm just gonna stand back
and watch it all go off.

00:59.240 --> 01:01.480
Parole Officer: Brendan
Kinsella, you are free to go.

01:01.720 --> 01:09.040
##

01:09.240 --> 01:11.040
Alarm buzzes

01:13.560 --> 01:15.560
Seagulls crying

01:18.800 --> 01:20.520
Door clangs

01:20.760 --> 01:23.160
Man: Prisoner Brendan Kinsella
cleared for release.

01:23.320 --> 01:25.840
Gate 4 cleared to open.

01:26.040 --> 01:28.360
Gate 4 open.

01:37.720 --> 01:40.400
Door closes, locks

01:47.760 --> 01:48.680
Chuckles

01:48.840 --> 01:50.800
Welcome home, Bren.

01:52.080 --> 01:54.920
Seagulls crying

02:15.400 --> 02:17.440
We're closed.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.520
I said we're closed.

02:19.720 --> 02:22.320
Are you fucking deaf?

02:22.600 --> 02:23.800
- Glass shatters
-Aah!

02:23.960 --> 02:25.000
Fuck.

02:25.160 --> 02:26.840
You got something
to say to me?

02:27.080 --> 02:30.120
No? Well, keep that
fucking shut.

02:30.280 --> 02:31.560
Here, here.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.560
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

02:34.760 --> 02:36.040
Bren.

02:36.280 --> 02:37.320
I've been waiting
a long time to see

02:37.560 --> 02:39.200
that look on your
face, Ged.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.560
Told ya I wouldn't
forget ya.

02:41.760 --> 02:43.080
You told me nothing.

02:43.320 --> 02:47.320
No wardens out here to go
telling your tales to.

02:47.520 --> 02:50.000
Fuck you.
I'm no rat.

02:50.240 --> 02:53.000
I just came to say
goodbye face to face.

02:53.280 --> 02:55.280
Scoffs Why?
Where are you going?

02:55.480 --> 02:57.560
Me?

02:57.720 --> 02:59.280
Nowhere.

03:04.520 --> 03:06.280
I'm not a rat.

03:06.560 --> 03:08.600
You come back here again,
and I'll put a fucking bullet

03:08.800 --> 03:10.160
in your head.

03:10.360 --> 03:11.920
You hear me?!

03:17.880 --> 03:24.640
##

03:24.960 --> 03:26.320
# Now my willy
is adjacent but... #

03:26.520 --> 03:27.840
Jimmy:
I'm telling you Michael.

03:28.080 --> 03:29.880
Wait 'til you
fucking see this.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.560
Damn.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.640
Coming in?

03:36.880 --> 03:37.920
Do I have to?

03:38.080 --> 03:39.640
Yes, you're my brother.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.320
I value your opinion
on these things.

03:41.480 --> 03:42.880
Fuck sake.

03:43.120 --> 03:44.720
Yeah,
that's the attitude.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.800
Alright, Jamie.
What do you got for me?

03:53.040 --> 03:55.120
Prepare to be
fucking dazzled.

03:55.320 --> 03:56.600
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

03:56.840 --> 03:59.480
This beauty here is a baby
Burmese python.

03:59.680 --> 04:03.000
She'll grow to 20 odd feet long
and swallow a pig whole.

04:03.240 --> 04:04.160
You mind if I have
a go of her?

04:04.280 --> 04:06.400
Yeah, no bother.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.840
Thought you were gone to
ground, Mikey.

04:10.080 --> 04:13.400
Don't blame you.
Those fucking Turks are mental.

04:13.640 --> 04:14.680
Went on holidays
there once.

04:14.920 --> 04:17.920
Hot as fuck
and full of Brits.

04:18.880 --> 04:19.920
Hello.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.400
Good news about your Da.

04:24.120 --> 04:26.800
What about him?

04:27.000 --> 04:28.480
Getting paroled.

04:31.680 --> 04:34.440
Who told you that?

04:34.600 --> 04:36.600
Becky's nephew Dean.

04:36.840 --> 04:38.480
He's in on
"B" wing with Bren.

04:38.640 --> 04:41.160
It could just be bollocks.

04:41.400 --> 04:43.680
Forget I said anything.
You know what people are like.

04:43.880 --> 04:45.560
They talk shite.

04:50.480 --> 04:53.360
It's probably fucking
bullshit, Michael.

04:53.600 --> 04:56.960
We'd have heard
if he was getting out.

04:57.160 --> 04:58.640
Somebody would've told us.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.800
Cellphone buzzing

05:28.280 --> 05:31.240
Amanda? This way.

05:48.120 --> 05:50.040
Well?

05:50.240 --> 05:52.280
Eric picked him up
earlier this morning.

05:52.480 --> 05:53.520
Did you know about this?

05:53.520 --> 05:55.080
Nobody fucking knew...

05:55.280 --> 05:56.240
except Eric.

05:56.480 --> 05:57.560
Why didn't
he say anything?

05:57.800 --> 05:59.040
Well, Bren, obviously,
told him not to.

05:59.280 --> 06:01.560
He is not coming back here
and taking over.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.160
That's not happening.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.640
I expect you all to
back me up on that.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.120
He's only out 5 minutes.

06:07.320 --> 06:09.040
No need to start drawing
battle lines up just yet.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.200
You've forgotten
what he's like.

06:11.440 --> 06:14.800
God knows what shit
he's going to cause for us.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.080
Where is he now?

06:16.320 --> 06:19.040
Gone down to fucking
Furry Bog with Eric.

06:19.240 --> 06:22.560
Wants to see us
all down there later.

06:22.760 --> 06:24.160
Yeah, you can go
if you want to.

06:24.360 --> 06:25.960
I'm not interested.

06:32.280 --> 06:33.920
Keys clatter

06:37.760 --> 06:39.640
Fuck sake.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.280
Fuck!

06:56.960 --> 06:59.120
So how have you
been doing?

06:59.320 --> 07:03.800
Well, obviously,
I'm not feeling brilliant.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.840
You're grieving.
It's the hardest part.

07:09.080 --> 07:13.400
So how soon before
I can go again?

07:13.600 --> 07:15.440
It's been less
than a month.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.120
I suggest you both
take a little time

07:17.320 --> 07:18.600
before making
any decisions.

07:18.760 --> 07:20.600
I don't want time.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.600
I want to try again
as soon as possible.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.680
Amanda, you've suffered
a recent bereavement.

07:24.840 --> 07:26.080
Two menstrual cycles --

07:26.280 --> 07:28.480
that's the recommended wait,
isn't it?

07:28.600 --> 07:30.160
I meant your son, Jamie.

07:34.400 --> 07:35.880
What's that got to do
with anything?

07:36.120 --> 07:39.080
It's perfectly natural
to want to replace

07:39.240 --> 07:41.240
a child who's died.

07:43.800 --> 07:44.920
Excuse me?

07:45.120 --> 07:47.080
What you're feeling
isn't unusual.

07:47.360 --> 07:50.360
But what I say to all
my patients in your situation

07:50.560 --> 07:54.040
is take your time
over every decision.

07:54.280 --> 07:57.120
I'm not here for
a counseling session.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.600
Myself and me husband
want a child.

07:59.840 --> 08:03.480
But if you're not willing
to help us,

08:03.720 --> 08:05.280
we can just
go somewhere else.

08:10.760 --> 08:12.280
Sighs

08:28.240 --> 08:29.600
Engine stops

08:32.600 --> 08:35.280
Cellphone buzzing

08:37.120 --> 08:38.400
Yeah?

08:38.560 --> 08:40.120
Is everything okay?

08:40.360 --> 08:41.560
Dad's out.

08:41.760 --> 08:42.800
He got parole.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.680
Viking collected him
this morning.

08:44.880 --> 08:46.400
Where is he?
At Birdy's?

08:46.640 --> 08:48.360
No, he's in
the pub with Viking.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.200
We're gonna
go see him now.

08:50.440 --> 08:52.440
Door opens

08:52.680 --> 08:55.560
Well, oh,
here they are now!

08:55.760 --> 08:57.040
Welcome home, Brendan.

08:57.240 --> 08:58.400
Ah.

08:58.640 --> 09:00.120
You should've told us
you were getting out.

09:00.320 --> 09:02.280
Why, and ruin
the fucking surprise?

09:02.520 --> 09:04.120
I would've had things
sorted for you.

09:04.360 --> 09:06.680
New clothes,
a place to stay.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.960
Well, can't
I crash in with you?

09:10.160 --> 09:11.280
Yeah, of course.

09:11.520 --> 09:12.640
Always a spare bed
if you need it.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.320
Right. Well, that's
all sorted then.

09:14.480 --> 09:15.840
Amanda:
I can't face him right now.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.400
Jimmy: It's okay. Honestly,
I'll make something up.

09:18.640 --> 09:20.480
There'll be plenty of time
to see him. Don't worry.

09:20.680 --> 09:21.920
Is Michael there, too?

09:23.560 --> 09:24.800
No, he's fucking raging.

09:25.800 --> 09:28.000
He doesn't want Da
stirring shit up.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.280
He's gone to the office
to sort out things

09:29.520 --> 09:31.640
before Dad
gets involved.

09:31.920 --> 09:34.800
Okay.
Talk to you later.

09:35.320 --> 09:36.800
Okay, I'll talk to you.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.440
Oh, little Lazarus.

09:43.680 --> 09:46.440
Back from
the fucking dead, huh?

09:46.640 --> 09:47.960
What happened, Frank?

09:48.200 --> 09:50.400
No queers
allowed in heaven?

09:52.040 --> 09:53.640
Laughs I'm only
fucking slagging you.

09:53.840 --> 09:55.400
Come here.

09:59.960 --> 10:02.280
Oh, I thought for a minute
there you weren't coming.

10:02.480 --> 10:03.880
Of course, I'd come, Da.
Come here.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.240
Hey.

10:05.400 --> 10:06.800
Where's Michael?

10:06.960 --> 10:08.400
He couldn't make it.

10:10.560 --> 10:14.280
And is that wife of yours
too busy to show her face?

10:14.520 --> 10:16.880
Ah, she wanted to come,
but she's visiting her Ma.

10:17.080 --> 10:18.360
Hey, what about Anthony?

10:18.600 --> 10:20.000
Sure he's in
fucking school.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.960
Well, fuck school. Go get him.
I want to see him.

10:23.160 --> 10:24.600
He's slipping in classes, Dad.
I'm not going to...

10:24.760 --> 10:26.080
Not every day
I get out, is it?

10:26.320 --> 10:28.040
I want me fucking
grandson here. Go get him.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.600
Go on.

10:31.040 --> 10:34.040
Okay. See you.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.560
Here we are now, Birdy.

10:36.760 --> 10:38.280
Here you are, Frank.

10:38.480 --> 10:40.760
Thanks.

10:40.920 --> 10:44.680
So Viking's been filling me
in on everything.

10:44.920 --> 10:48.960
I hear business is booming,
so that's fucking something.

10:49.200 --> 10:52.600
But this business
with the Turks,

10:52.800 --> 10:54.680
I'm not fucking
sure about that.

10:54.920 --> 10:56.640
What are you
not sure about?

10:56.800 --> 10:59.880
Well, why we're
paying them.

11:00.120 --> 11:01.600
I don't know.
They are a pretty major outfit.

11:01.840 --> 11:03.480
I've never fucking heard
of them.

11:03.680 --> 11:06.040
Well, things have changed
since you went inside.

11:09.720 --> 11:11.240
Oh, is that
fucking right?

11:14.360 --> 11:16.600
Uh, maybe we should be having
this conversation

11:16.800 --> 11:19.720
when Jimmy and Michael
and Amanda can be here.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.160
Oh, you're quite right, Birdy.

11:27.360 --> 11:29.640
Today is a day
for celebrating...

11:29.880 --> 11:30.960
not business.

11:31.200 --> 11:34.280
So here's to fucking
those Turks.

11:34.520 --> 11:36.640
Ha, ha, ha!
Fucking those Turks, yes!

11:36.920 --> 11:38.360
Glasses clink

11:40.440 --> 11:42.000
Ah.

11:53.640 --> 11:56.920
You're not out celebrating
your father's release?

11:57.160 --> 11:58.800
Scoffs That's good.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.160
You're going to need
that sense of humor.

12:06.080 --> 12:09.040
You're the one he'll be
coming after first.

12:09.200 --> 12:10.600
Don't sugarcoat it.

12:10.840 --> 12:12.680
You need
to be prepared.

12:12.840 --> 12:13.960
Okay.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.440
Any cash
lying around?

12:15.680 --> 12:17.160
Yeah, but that's all earmarked
for the Batuks.

12:17.360 --> 12:18.920
Move it somewhere
he can't get his hands on it.

12:19.160 --> 12:21.320
He's not touching that.
It's all spoken for.

12:24.600 --> 12:27.120
Everything has just
changed, Amanda.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.000
I hope you get that.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.840
Now move the money.

12:32.480 --> 12:36.720
So all this money we've been
making off of Eamon's drugs,

12:36.880 --> 12:38.120
where is that now?

12:38.360 --> 12:40.840
Oh, Amanda looks
after the finances.

12:41.040 --> 12:43.960
Right. Okay, so what's
she been doing with it?

12:44.200 --> 12:45.080
Uh, it's spread around,
you know.

12:45.240 --> 12:46.440
Some of it's in cash.

12:46.640 --> 12:47.880
Some of it's in
shell companies abroad.

12:48.080 --> 12:50.000
We've been buying up car parks,
properties...

12:50.200 --> 12:51.480
What do we want
with car parks?

12:51.720 --> 12:54.200
She uses their spare capacity
to clean cash.

12:54.400 --> 12:57.280
Plus, it provides us
with a legal source of income.

12:57.440 --> 12:58.960
Right.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.600
And you see that thing Eamon
said about Amanda

13:01.840 --> 13:04.240
being the one
that wanted to plug Viking

13:04.440 --> 13:08.960
and not him --
What do you reckon?

13:09.200 --> 13:10.560
Well, Amanda
says that's a lie.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.840
That Eamon was just trying
to stir up shit.

13:13.080 --> 13:14.160
Yeah, well,
I know what she said.

13:14.280 --> 13:16.000
But what do you think?

13:20.520 --> 13:22.280
Do you believe her?

13:27.520 --> 13:28.640
I don't know.

13:28.920 --> 13:31.880
You see, we can't
fucking have that.

13:32.080 --> 13:34.080
We can't have someone
we don't trust holding

13:34.320 --> 13:35.640
the purse strings
for this family.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.320
She is smart
with money, Bren.

13:37.520 --> 13:41.480
How is agreeing to pay
$90 million over 4 months smart?

13:41.680 --> 13:43.560
Looks to me like we're
cutting our own throat.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.560
Jimmy and Mikey
believe her.

13:45.760 --> 13:48.240
Well, you let me worry
about them, alright?

13:50.600 --> 13:52.160
Door opens

13:54.840 --> 13:57.400
Anthony, this is
your granddad.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.560
You just call me
Bren, young fella.

13:59.720 --> 14:00.920
Okay.

14:01.120 --> 14:02.800
Look at the big Kinsella
head on him, eh?

14:03.000 --> 14:04.520
Come here, buddy.

14:05.560 --> 14:15.280
##

14:15.480 --> 14:25.200
##

14:25.400 --> 14:35.280
##

14:35.800 --> 14:38.160
You can't see, Zeeb.
Not without an appointment.

14:38.360 --> 14:40.480
Ring him and tell him
we're here.

14:56.400 --> 14:57.920
Okay.

14:59.560 --> 15:00.560
Buzzer

15:00.760 --> 15:02.280
Just one.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.520
This isn't due
until next week.

15:16.720 --> 15:19.040
Amanda: We'd rather not have all
this cash just sitting around.

15:19.240 --> 15:20.600
So we'll pay over
what's here now

15:20.800 --> 15:22.280
and then the balance
when it's due.

15:22.520 --> 15:23.960
If that's
what you want.

15:24.160 --> 15:25.640
It is.

15:31.840 --> 15:34.000
Machine whirring

15:35.360 --> 15:36.400
Kem: You're the one
that ran up the debt.

15:36.640 --> 15:37.600
I thought
the supermarket job

15:37.840 --> 15:38.800
was going to
clear all that.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.440
Zach, you're in
for 8 grand.

15:41.640 --> 15:43.840
One job's not going
to clear that.

15:44.080 --> 15:46.120
You're fucking dreaming
if you think it does.

15:46.360 --> 15:49.600
Anyway, I had to
finish him off for you.

15:49.800 --> 15:52.400
Look, this one
is easy, yeah?

15:52.560 --> 15:53.880
I have it all set up.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.120
Well, after this,
Kem, me and you,

15:55.320 --> 15:56.320
we're all square, yeah?

15:56.560 --> 15:58.600
Shit, yeah.
Of course.

15:58.840 --> 16:01.280
Indistinct talking

16:04.320 --> 16:05.600
Alright.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.880
-Okay.
-There you go.

16:08.840 --> 16:10.240
Baby cooing

16:10.480 --> 16:11.520
What was
all that about?

16:11.760 --> 16:13.880
Uh, nothing.
Just a chat.

16:16.920 --> 16:18.840
Baby fussing

16:27.960 --> 16:28.960
Thanks, Birdy.

16:29.080 --> 16:31.200
You're welcome.

16:31.360 --> 16:32.920
See you tomorrow, pet?

16:40.640 --> 16:42.440
Door closes

16:49.080 --> 16:50.800
Buzzer

16:58.400 --> 17:00.440
Michael: How was that?

17:00.640 --> 17:01.680
Birdy: You know what
your Da's like.

17:01.880 --> 17:03.440
You're okay?

17:03.640 --> 17:05.480
Yeah.

17:05.680 --> 17:08.040
Yeah. I'll be fine.

17:08.560 --> 17:11.080
Did he say
what he plans to do?

17:11.280 --> 17:13.600
Not really.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.960
Where's he staying,
with Viking?

17:17.120 --> 17:19.000
No, he's, uh...

17:19.240 --> 17:23.280
He's staying at my place
just 'til he get's settled.

17:23.440 --> 17:25.080
And you let him.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.400
He's my brother.

17:34.160 --> 17:37.840
Now, look, I'm only around
the corner if you need me.

17:38.040 --> 17:39.800
I can take
care of myself.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.640
Liquid pouring

17:43.000 --> 17:44.480
I mean that.

17:48.080 --> 17:52.680
You need to keep Anna
far away from him.

17:52.840 --> 17:54.480
I know.

17:59.720 --> 18:07.120
# SONG: CMAT - "I Don't Really

Nikki, Denise.

18:27.640 --> 18:28.880
Bren.

18:29.080 --> 18:31.560
Bren, come here.

18:32.640 --> 18:33.800
Mwah.

18:33.960 --> 18:35.600
I want you to meet Nikki.

18:35.800 --> 18:38.400
Oh, you're
the notorious Nikki, huh?

18:38.640 --> 18:40.520
Nice to meet you.
How are you?

18:40.760 --> 18:43.480
Now, which one of these two
is for me?

18:43.680 --> 18:44.960
You're funny.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.320
I bet this one's a bit
of a handful, Eric, what?

18:47.480 --> 18:48.960
Oh, yeah, a weapon.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.640
Yeah, do you girls
like champagne?

18:50.800 --> 18:52.160
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

18:52.360 --> 18:55.040
Right. Go find somewhere to sit,
and I'll get you some.

18:55.280 --> 18:57.640
You got a bottle
of champagne there...

18:57.880 --> 19:00.000
and a bunch of glasses?

19:00.160 --> 19:02.920
So I'm gonna
hit the road, Bren.

19:03.160 --> 19:05.720
Don't go.
Stay a bit longer.

19:05.920 --> 19:08.960
I would, but I've got
an early morning.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.960
I'm fucking serious.
Stay.

19:12.120 --> 19:13.680
Hey, come here.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.000
You see them
security cameras up there.

19:17.200 --> 19:18.440
Are they working?

19:18.680 --> 19:20.440
Yeah. I'll turn them off
if you want.

19:20.680 --> 19:22.440
No, no, no.
Leave them running.

19:22.640 --> 19:25.120
And I want the footage
from tonight saved, right?

19:25.280 --> 19:26.960
Okay.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.600
What the fuck
are you on?

19:29.800 --> 19:31.920
Nothing for you
to worry about.

19:32.120 --> 19:33.640
Get yourself
another drink.

19:33.920 --> 19:36.440
And make sure those cameras
see your mug.

19:39.280 --> 19:41.320
Here we go!

21:33.168 --> 21:35.608
I heard how you plugged
Con Doyle.

21:37.048 --> 21:40.168
Everyone inside was
talking about it.

21:40.408 --> 21:43.408
They know what you're made
of now, huh?

21:43.648 --> 21:45.088

fuck with you, son.

21:59.008 --> 22:00.488
What do you mean?

22:00.728 --> 22:03.888
The way she treats you
like a fucking lap dog.

22:04.088 --> 22:06.288
Like she's the man
and you're the woman.

22:06.528 --> 22:09.008
It's embarrassing for you
and for all of us.

22:09.208 --> 22:10.688
What do you want me
to do, Da?

22:10.888 --> 22:12.008
She's my fucking wife.

22:12.248 --> 22:14.168
Stop acting like
a fucking handbag.

22:14.408 --> 22:15.528
Door opens

22:15.768 --> 22:17.608
This is a private

22:17.808 --> 22:19.328
Fuck off.

22:21.768 --> 22:23.968
Door opens

22:24.768 --> 22:27.248
I'm not having a go at you,
Jimmy, right?

22:27.408 --> 22:28.568
Just telling you.

22:28.768 --> 22:31.848
People are fucking
laughing at you.

22:32.048 --> 22:33.328
You can't have that.

22:33.488 --> 22:36.288
You just can't.

22:36.488 --> 22:38.448
Stand up for yourself.

22:38.648 --> 22:41.408
Go out and find yourself
some young one and fuck her.

22:43.768 --> 22:45.288
Act like a man.

22:49.808 --> 22:52.128
Shouting, cheering

22:52.328 --> 22:53.848
What's the story here?

22:54.088 --> 22:57.008
Just up on Twitter,
Prison Rat is dead.

22:57.208 --> 22:58.248
Who?

22:58.248 --> 23:00.168
Delaney.

23:00.408 --> 23:01.728
He's one of our
best customers, Da.

23:01.968 --> 23:03.648
Yeah, someone else will step
into his shoes.

23:03.808 --> 23:06.008
They always do.

23:06.208 --> 23:08.088
I know what I'm doing.

23:08.288 --> 23:11.208
Come on, right there.

23:11.408 --> 23:14.568
I love you.
I love you, and I love you.

23:17.808 --> 23:18.928
What's up?

23:20.768 --> 23:23.088
Did you set
this all up for him?

23:23.328 --> 23:26.008
Set what up?
Laughs

23:26.928 --> 23:28.648
Ya should've
said something.

23:28.888 --> 23:30.688
Ah, Bren wanted
it kept quiet.

23:30.928 --> 23:33.488
Laughter

23:33.688 --> 23:35.848
I'll bet he fucking did.

23:36.048 --> 23:37.608
I don't know what your
problem with him is.

23:37.808 --> 23:39.288
He's sound.

23:39.528 --> 23:40.728
What, so you spent
a few months with him inside,

23:40.968 --> 23:43.568
and now he's your fucking
hero, is that it?

23:43.768 --> 23:44.928
No.

23:45.168 --> 23:46.248
'Cause when Eamon
was gunning for us

23:46.448 --> 23:47.728
when there was a bounty
on your head,

23:47.968 --> 23:50.328
he did not want to fucking
know anything about you.

23:50.568 --> 23:52.648
So you keep this up,
being his fucking lackey,

23:52.888 --> 23:54.288
and he will burn you,
and I won't be able

23:54.448 --> 23:56.568
to do anything to help.

23:58.528 --> 24:00.248
I'm not
his fucking lackey.

24:02.168 --> 24:03.528
I just happen to think
Bren's exactly

24:03.768 --> 24:05.808
what this family
needs right now --

24:06.048 --> 24:08.488
someone people
actually respect.

24:09.648 --> 24:12.368
Where's that fucking pint?
Give me that. Whoo!

Anna, let's go.

Hey. Tell me you're not
smoking weed in there.

27:17.048 --> 27:18.448
Are you seriously about
to give me a fucking lecture

27:18.648 --> 27:19.768
on the dangers of drugs?

27:19.968 --> 27:21.328
Somebody called me
from your phone.

27:21.528 --> 27:23.408
That was a joke.
We were just messing about.

27:23.648 --> 27:24.928
You didn't have
to come here

27:25.208 --> 27:26.448
and embarrass me in front
of all my friends.

27:26.688 --> 27:28.048
It's 3:00 a.m.,
I get a call from a strange man,

27:28.168 --> 27:29.328
from your phone.

27:29.488 --> 27:30.688
I was worried, Anna.

27:30.888 --> 27:32.728
Well, I'm fine,
so you can go now.

27:32.968 --> 27:34.368
I'm not leaving you here
like this.

27:34.488 --> 27:35.648
Like what exactly?

27:35.888 --> 27:36.808
I think you should
call it a night.

27:36.928 --> 27:39.288
No.

27:39.528 --> 27:41.168
Come on,
I'll take you home.

27:41.368 --> 27:44.608
I'm staying at Katie's, so I'll
just leave when she's leaving.

27:45.208 --> 27:46.608
Chuckles

27:46.768 --> 27:47.888
Your grandmother know
you're here?

27:48.048 --> 27:49.608
Of course not.

27:49.808 --> 27:52.248
The same way she doesn't know
that I meet you, Michael.

27:57.688 --> 27:59.488
Something I need
to talk to you about.

27:59.648 --> 28:00.648
Okay, that's...

28:00.888 --> 28:02.328
Anna, are you
coming back or what?

28:02.568 --> 28:04.208
Yeah.
I'll be in in a sec.

28:06.728 --> 28:09.488
Look, I'll call you.
But don't do this again, please?

28:11.848 --> 28:14.248
Music playing

28:23.728 --> 28:25.448
Fuck.

28:29.528 --> 28:31.688
Doorbell rings

28:38.808 --> 28:41.208
Doorbell rings

28:48.728 --> 28:50.848
Doorbell rings

28:52.048 --> 28:53.168
It's okay, love.
I'll get it.

28:53.368 --> 28:54.888
Go on, go back to bed.

28:58.968 --> 29:01.088
Snoring

29:18.848 --> 29:21.088
Doorbell rings

29:23.848 --> 29:25.808
Did you hear about
Ged Delaney?

29:25.968 --> 29:26.928
No.

29:27.088 --> 29:28.488
He was killed
last night.

29:28.728 --> 29:31.248
They're saying the guards
think it was us.

29:31.408 --> 29:32.408
That's a load of shite.

29:32.608 --> 29:34.248
Yeah, is it?

29:34.448 --> 29:35.808
I warned you.

29:35.968 --> 29:38.888
Everything's changed now
that he's out.

29:39.128 --> 29:40.328
Why would Bren want to kill
Ged Delaney?

29:40.568 --> 29:43.408
Fuck knows.
I'm gonna find out.

29:43.608 --> 29:45.168
He's upstairs.

29:46.968 --> 29:48.528
In Jamie's room.

29:51.128 --> 29:53.288
Ged Delaney, was that you?

29:54.568 --> 29:56.688
I didn't expect balloons
or bunting,

29:56.928 --> 30:00.688
but fucking "Welcome home,
Dad" might be nice.

30:00.888 --> 30:01.888
What's going on?

30:02.088 --> 30:03.288
Anthony, go to your room.

30:03.488 --> 30:05.608
Did you order
Ged's shooting or not?

30:05.808 --> 30:08.568
He was a snitch.
Cost me two years remission.

30:08.728 --> 30:09.808
He got what he deserved.

30:10.008 --> 30:11.368
He was one of our
best customers.

30:11.568 --> 30:13.168
Not any fuckin' more
he's not.

30:13.408 --> 30:15.608
We needed his business
to pay the Batuks.

30:15.848 --> 30:19.088
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
they can go fuck themselves.

30:19.248 --> 30:20.608
No. They'll fuck us
instead.

30:20.808 --> 30:23.088
Listen, this is man talk,
pet, alright?

30:23.288 --> 30:26.608
So why don't you just
fucking button it?

30:26.848 --> 30:28.848
You start throwing
your weight around,

30:29.088 --> 30:31.008
and you'll see
what happens, alright?

30:31.208 --> 30:32.568
What?

30:32.768 --> 30:35.808
Would the magician go get
his big gun and clip me?

30:36.008 --> 30:37.808
Maybe.
Yeah?

30:38.008 --> 30:41.448
Well, do fucking something
or fuck off.

30:41.648 --> 30:45.568
'Cause your whining's giving me
a pain in the fucking hole.

30:45.768 --> 30:48.208
Coughs

31:30.928 --> 31:34.568
Don't you ever get involved
in a row between me and Michael.

31:34.768 --> 31:37.088
Do you hear me?

31:37.328 --> 31:39.648
Jimmy is your husband,
not Michael.

31:39.888 --> 31:41.808
You'd do well
to remember that.

31:42.008 --> 31:43.888
I was trying to explain
the situation here.

31:44.048 --> 31:45.248
No, no, no, no.

31:45.488 --> 31:48.088
You don't fucking explain
anything to me.

31:48.248 --> 31:49.768
I explain to you.

31:53.048 --> 31:55.208
You see all this
you have here?

31:55.448 --> 31:57.168
The fancy house
and the clothes,

31:57.448 --> 32:00.008
that all came from
my craft, right?

32:00.208 --> 32:02.768
'Cause I fucking started
all this.

32:03.008 --> 32:05.488
And I can
take it away, too.

32:05.688 --> 32:07.968
Don't you ever fucking
forget it.

32:10.248 --> 32:14.088
You might think
you're special now.

32:14.328 --> 32:16.768
But I remember you, me girl,
when you were still giving

32:17.008 --> 32:19.288
Jimmy blow jobs
in his bedroom.

32:22.688 --> 32:24.528
Jimmy:
Da, you still here?

32:24.768 --> 32:28.648
I suppose your brother woke you
ringing the bell, did he?

32:28.808 --> 32:29.888
What did he want?

32:30.088 --> 32:32.368
Eh, he was just
saying hello.

32:32.608 --> 32:35.088
You hungry?
I was going to do a fry up.

32:35.288 --> 32:37.008
I better get ready for work.

32:37.248 --> 32:38.488
Yeah, I believe
you're the person

32:38.728 --> 32:40.648
I talk to
about getting paper.

32:43.008 --> 32:44.168
How much do you need?

32:44.368 --> 32:45.848
Just walking around money
for now,

32:46.048 --> 32:47.888
so 30 grand should do it.

32:50.008 --> 32:51.808
I'll arrange that
for you.

32:52.048 --> 32:53.688
Oh, and I bought
the Furry Bog last night,

32:53.928 --> 32:55.168
so I'll need money
for that, as well.

32:55.448 --> 32:58.328
Oh, forgot about that.
Chuckles

32:58.568 --> 32:59.488
How much?

32:59.728 --> 33:00.928
I don't
have the exact figure.

33:01.208 --> 33:03.728
I just said, "How much
would the insurance pay

33:03.928 --> 33:05.408
if this place
was to burn down?

33:05.608 --> 33:07.568
And I'll give you
50 grand more."

33:07.688 --> 33:09.208
He got the message.

33:11.528 --> 33:15.128
Well, let me know when you
find out how much it is.

33:38.408 --> 33:40.368

34:30.648 --> 34:33.768
Well, I'm off.

34:33.968 --> 34:36.448
I thought we were supposed
to go on into town.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.608
Yeah, we will, later.

34:38.848 --> 34:41.448
Later?
I'm working later.

34:41.728 --> 34:43.768
Tomorrow then.
Chuckles

34:43.968 --> 34:45.928
I have to go
collect Bren now.

34:46.248 --> 34:48.128
So, what?
Are you his driver now, Eric?

34:49.408 --> 34:52.528
Laughs No.
I'm not his fucking driver.

34:52.688 --> 34:54.888
Then, why are you
driving him around?

35:00.768 --> 35:02.328
Bren's taking charge
of the family.

35:04.968 --> 35:08.848
If I'm his right-hand man,
and he steps away,

35:09.008 --> 35:11.808
guess who's next in line.

35:12.048 --> 35:14.288
Sighs

35:14.528 --> 35:17.808
Just don't let him talk you
into doing anything stupid.

35:18.008 --> 35:19.568
I thought you liked him.

35:19.768 --> 35:20.888
I do.

35:21.088 --> 35:22.608
Well, then.

35:24.888 --> 35:26.448
Look...

35:29.568 --> 35:35.208
Bren trusts me,
and he believes in me,

35:35.448 --> 35:38.488
not like Frank
and the others.

35:38.728 --> 35:40.408
With Bren,
we're going places.

35:40.568 --> 35:43.088
Yeah?

35:43.248 --> 35:44.248
Yeah.

35:44.448 --> 35:46.848
I'll take you
shopping tomorrow.

35:47.048 --> 35:48.448
Promise.

35:48.648 --> 35:50.608
Anywhere you want to go.

35:50.848 --> 35:52.968
Chuckles

35:55.488 --> 35:57.208
Love you.

35:58.528 --> 36:00.328

Hey, I was trying
to call Frank.

36:43.448 --> 36:45.368
And his phone is off.

36:45.608 --> 36:47.008
You don't have
Dan's number do you?

36:47.208 --> 36:50.088
Yeah, I have it
here somewhere.

36:50.328 --> 36:52.488
Bren stayed
with us last night.

36:52.688 --> 36:55.128
Michael called around earlier
to have it out with him.

36:55.368 --> 36:57.128
What about?

36:57.368 --> 37:00.448
Bren ordering
Ged Delaney's killing.

37:00.688 --> 37:03.208
How is that Bren?
He's only just out.

37:03.408 --> 37:06.688
I imagine Viking set it up.

37:06.888 --> 37:08.848
Ged was a good customer.

37:09.048 --> 37:11.608
We needed his business
to repay the Batuks.

37:11.848 --> 37:14.608
And Bren is talking about
reneging on our deal with them.

37:14.808 --> 37:16.408
I don't know where you think
you're going with this, Amanda,

37:16.608 --> 37:20.168
but you need
to be very careful.

37:20.328 --> 37:22.288
Bren is not Frank.

37:22.488 --> 37:24.528
He will hurt you.

37:53.741 --> 37:56.101
Look, can't stay long.

37:56.301 --> 37:57.941
Amanda: Who is this?

37:58.101 --> 38:00.021
Chloe.

38:00.221 --> 38:01.501
How old is she?

38:01.701 --> 38:04.581
Nearly 5 months.

38:04.821 --> 38:07.341
You are gorgeous,
aren't you, Chloe?

38:07.541 --> 38:09.061
Got to go soon.

38:13.981 --> 38:16.861
I'm guessing you helped set up
that thing last night.

38:17.021 --> 38:18.621
Tried saying no.

38:18.821 --> 38:20.981
Viking wasn't having it.

38:21.181 --> 38:22.661
What else is he planning?

38:25.621 --> 38:27.981
You can trust me.

38:28.181 --> 38:29.781
I'm not gonna
drop you in it.

38:29.941 --> 38:32.021
I never have.

38:32.221 --> 38:35.301
You know that.

38:35.581 --> 38:37.861
Don't know what exactly,
but he has me putting lads

38:38.101 --> 38:40.781
on retainer,
so he's planning something.

38:40.981 --> 38:44.741
If you get any details,
you let me know.

38:44.941 --> 38:46.381
You'll get me plugged.

38:46.581 --> 38:48.061
Don't worry.

38:48.261 --> 38:50.381
We're all in
the one family.

38:50.621 --> 38:52.741
It's not like I'm the enemy
or anything.

38:52.981 --> 38:56.981
As far as Viking's concerned,
you are the enemy.

38:58.381 --> 39:00.221
Got to go.

39:07.061 --> 39:09.021

your death, O, Lord,

39:09.221 --> 39:13.141
and profess your resurrection
until you come again.

39:13.381 --> 39:18.061
Save us, Savior of the world,
by your cross and resurrection,

39:18.261 --> 39:20.381
you have set us free.

39:20.621 --> 39:23.821
Through him, with him,
and in him,

39:23.981 --> 39:28.941
O, God Almighty father,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,

39:29.101 --> 39:30.221
live now and forever.

39:30.421 --> 39:31.941
Frank.

39:34.581 --> 39:38.501
Let us pray to the father
in the words our Savior gave us.

39:38.701 --> 39:39.741
What?
Amanda's been ringing.

39:39.741 --> 39:41.461
She wants you to call her.

39:41.741 --> 39:43.261
Did you tell her
where I was?

39:43.461 --> 39:44.901
No.

39:45.101 --> 39:46.621
Give us your phone.

39:52.941 --> 39:55.221
# Stick it up, mister #

39:55.461 --> 39:57.461
Engine revs

39:57.661 --> 39:59.221
Just put your foot
down, bud.

39:59.381 --> 40:00.381
You sure?

40:00.581 --> 40:02.021
Sure, go for it.

40:02.221 --> 40:03.741
Eric doesn't care, do you?

40:03.901 --> 40:05.341
No.

40:05.541 --> 40:06.981
It's only
a fucking car, huh?

40:07.141 --> 40:08.741
# I said yeah #

40:08.901 --> 40:10.301
# I said yeah #

40:10.421 --> 40:11.981
# What they say #

40:12.181 --> 40:13.221
# Listen what they say #

40:13.421 --> 40:14.861
Ah! Faster.

40:15.061 --> 40:17.781
Great, lock her over
and keep her left.

40:17.941 --> 40:20.461
That's it.

40:20.741 --> 40:22.381
Laughs

40:22.621 --> 40:25.621

40:27.381 --> 40:30.021
Hey. Yeah.

# Oh, give it to me one time #

40:37.541 --> 40:39.101
Fuck sake.

40:39.301 --> 40:40.501
Did you see that?

40:40.701 --> 40:42.781
He's a fucking
natural, huh?

40:43.021 --> 40:44.501
Want to go again?
Can I?

40:44.741 --> 40:47.381
Fucking go as many times
as you want.

40:47.621 --> 40:50.501

41:10.381 --> 41:12.301
Beeping

41:24.741 --> 41:26.701
You're wearing
a vest again.

41:26.901 --> 41:28.181
You don't think
Ged Delaney's crew

41:28.421 --> 41:30.861
are going to be out
gunning for blood?

41:31.061 --> 41:31.981
I'd be shocked
if they weren't

41:32.221 --> 41:34.141
already planning
to hit back.

41:35.461 --> 41:37.101
I need your help
with something.

41:37.341 --> 41:38.341
Scoffs

41:38.341 --> 41:39.661
What?

41:39.901 --> 41:43.061
It's just funny,
you know.

41:43.301 --> 41:44.541
You put such an effort
into pushing me aside,

41:44.781 --> 41:46.221
and now you're asking me
for me help.

41:46.461 --> 41:47.781
I didn't try
to push you aside.

41:47.981 --> 41:49.181
Don't fucking lie to me.

41:49.381 --> 41:51.221
Frank.
Just fucking admit it.

41:51.421 --> 41:53.101
Just fucking admit you tried to
fuck me over and take me place.

41:53.341 --> 41:54.981
Just fucking say it.
This isn't helpful, Frank.

41:55.141 --> 41:57.101
I don't fucking care.

41:57.301 --> 41:59.101
You know, I'd have more respect
for her if she just --

41:59.301 --> 42:00.661
if she was straight up
and told the truth.

42:00.901 --> 42:02.381
Come on, I just want to hear
you fucking say it.

42:02.541 --> 42:05.381
You fucking
lied, Frank.

42:05.621 --> 42:09.381
When Jamie was murdered, you
knew that Viking had caused it.

42:09.581 --> 42:11.741
But you lied,
and you tried to buy us off

42:11.861 --> 42:13.301
with Eamon's money.

42:13.541 --> 42:15.021
To have an easy life.

42:15.261 --> 42:17.861
So as far as I'm concerned,
whatever happened to you,

42:18.061 --> 42:20.141
you had it coming.

42:26.581 --> 42:28.101
So what do you want?

42:30.261 --> 42:32.261
Ged Delaney's name is on
at least a third

42:32.461 --> 42:34.221
of the shipment in transit.

42:34.461 --> 42:36.941
I was counting on his money
to pay the Batuks.

42:37.181 --> 42:39.261
But with him dead
and Beady Donovan gone, too,

42:39.501 --> 42:40.861
we need to find
new buyers quickly.

42:41.101 --> 42:42.901
Which isn't
gonna be easy.

42:43.141 --> 42:44.381
'Cause everyone's gonna know
that Bren did Ged.

42:44.621 --> 42:45.741
They're not going to be
queuing up to do

42:45.901 --> 42:47.341
fucking business with us.

42:47.581 --> 42:50.381
Without new buyers, we can't
make that first payment.

42:50.621 --> 42:51.581
And do we have anything
else hidden away

42:51.741 --> 42:52.901
that we can use instead?

42:53.101 --> 42:55.141
Nothing liquid that won't
arouse suspicion

42:55.301 --> 42:56.661
if I start moving it.

42:56.901 --> 42:58.581
Right now, almost everything
that we're earning

42:58.741 --> 43:00.941
has to go to the Batuks
and it's still not enough.

43:01.141 --> 43:03.181
We need new buyers.

43:03.381 --> 43:06.181
And we need to find new ways
to increase our revenue.

43:15.581 --> 43:17.901
Why are you doing this?

43:18.101 --> 43:19.941
To spare us another war.

43:20.181 --> 43:22.221
No, I mean, why are you
doing any of this?

43:25.181 --> 43:28.181
You know, Bren being back,
it's your chance to get out,

43:28.381 --> 43:31.781
to just get
away from all of this.

43:32.021 --> 43:34.901
'Cause he's gonna do everything
he can to push you aside.

43:35.101 --> 43:36.941
Well, I'm not gonna
let that happen.

43:37.101 --> 43:38.701
Yeah, well, we'll see.

43:41.061 --> 43:43.261
You know, you could walk away
from all this now.

43:43.541 --> 43:46.221
No one would say a word.
Put it all behind you.

43:46.421 --> 43:47.741
Enjoy your money.

43:47.941 --> 43:51.061
Enjoy your time
with Jimmy and Anthony.

43:51.261 --> 43:52.781
Just be happy.

44:03.181 --> 44:04.701
You gonna help us or not?

44:09.581 --> 44:11.981
Yeah.

44:12.181 --> 44:14.381
I'll make a few calls.

44:14.581 --> 44:16.021
See who's buying.

44:16.221 --> 44:17.461
Thank you.

44:17.661 --> 44:19.621
But you know this thing
with Ged Delaney,

44:19.821 --> 44:21.101
this is just the beginning
to this shit.

44:21.301 --> 44:23.141
Bren's just getting started.

44:23.301 --> 44:24.861
We know.

44:30.141 --> 44:32.901
Door opens, closes

44:39.021 --> 44:40.861
Bren: Come here to me.

44:42.461 --> 44:45.181
Do you know who this is?

44:45.421 --> 44:47.381
No.
No?

44:47.581 --> 44:49.861
His name is Glen Wright.

44:51.221 --> 44:53.021
That's the lad
that shot Jamie.

45:01.541 --> 45:04.461
Now, we can't let that
go unanswered.

45:04.621 --> 45:07.101
You know that, don't you,
Anthony?

45:07.221 --> 45:08.901
Yeah.

45:10.301 --> 45:15.181
So I could pay someone
to do that for us.

45:17.021 --> 45:21.381
But that'd be wrong
'cause Jamie is family.

45:24.941 --> 45:26.901
And you would resent me
for not giving you

45:27.101 --> 45:29.141
the chance
to do what's right.

45:31.301 --> 45:33.741
I want to do it.
Of course you do.

45:33.981 --> 45:36.061
'Cause you've my
fucking blood in ya.

45:39.981 --> 45:43.141
You want to know how you go
about doing something like this?

45:43.341 --> 45:46.221
Don't think of it as, like,
some fucking awful job

45:46.421 --> 45:48.901
you have to do.

45:49.101 --> 45:50.621
Enjoy it.

45:53.261 --> 45:56.141
That is the cunt
that killed your brother.

45:59.501 --> 46:01.861
So enjoy the look of fear
on his face

46:02.061 --> 46:03.821
when he sees you
coming towards him

46:04.021 --> 46:07.381
and he realizes
what's gonna happen.

46:07.581 --> 46:09.341
Enjoy it.

46:09.581 --> 46:12.901
Enjoy plugging him
and watching him fucking die.

46:16.341 --> 46:18.221
Enjoy every bit of it.

46:20.821 --> 46:22.461
Okay.

46:26.341 --> 46:27.981
You have it?

46:28.181 --> 46:29.221
Yeah.

46:29.381 --> 46:31.021
Good man.

46:32.861 --> 46:33.901
You ever shot one before?

46:34.101 --> 46:36.741
No.
Nothing to it.

46:37.021 --> 46:39.021
Now this one doesn't have
much kick.

46:39.261 --> 46:41.581
But you're still better off
holding it with both hands.

46:41.781 --> 46:43.341
You don't want
to miss, you see?

46:47.141 --> 46:48.221
Alright, now remember
what I said.

46:48.381 --> 46:49.701
Enjoy it.

46:49.901 --> 46:55.061
