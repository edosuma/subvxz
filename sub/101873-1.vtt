WEBVTT

01:51.478 --> 01:53.081
Babe, it's me again.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.782
Seriously, where are you?

01:56.283 --> 02:00.287
I'm gonna wait for like five
minutes and then forget it.

02:25.113 --> 02:26.480
Are you here for the reunion?

02:26.514 --> 02:28.348
I'm just waiting for someone.

02:29.216 --> 02:30.118
Sorry.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.119
Thought I recognized you.

02:48.670 --> 02:51.171
Oh my God, hi.

02:51.204 --> 02:52.140
Hey.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.574
Hello, how are you?

02:53.608 --> 02:54.408
It's Sara, remember?

02:55.475 --> 02:56.476
Sara.

02:56.511 --> 02:57.444
Yeah.

02:57.477 --> 02:58.412
Jessica Bentley, right?

02:58.445 --> 02:59.379
Yeah.

02:59.413 --> 03:00.515
Sara, right.

03:00.548 --> 03:01.749
We were-

03:01.783 --> 03:02.550
- In every single
class together.

03:02.583 --> 03:03.818
It's just amazing.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.218
I had no idea you were invited.

03:05.252 --> 03:06.688
Actually I wasn't.

03:06.721 --> 03:10.024
Simon was coming and he thought
since I went to Mass Acre-

03:10.058 --> 03:11.759
- Oh my god, Simon Hughes.

03:11.793 --> 03:12.627
No fucking way.

03:12.660 --> 03:13.728
Is he here?

03:13.761 --> 03:15.063
- Not yeah.
- No.

03:15.096 --> 03:17.565
I honestly, I had the
biggest crush on him

03:17.598 --> 03:18.766
when I was in high school.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.735
I always wondered what
he looks like now.

03:20.768 --> 03:22.235
He looks great.

03:22.269 --> 03:23.270
He's my fiance.

03:24.906 --> 03:25.807
Wow, okay.

03:26.708 --> 03:28.176
Cool.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.110
I don't know, like do you
want to go in together?

03:29.143 --> 03:30.477
You know, like old times.

03:30.511 --> 03:33.313
Like Jess and Sarah
in the dinner hall

03:33.346 --> 03:35.183
gossiping over cold pizza.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.150
That
was a thing we did?

03:36.184 --> 03:36.984
Yeah.

03:37.018 --> 03:38.218
All right, Sara.

03:38.251 --> 03:39.386
Got a spark?

03:39.419 --> 03:41.155
Ooh, actually
spliff much better.

03:41.189 --> 03:42.023
Thank you.

03:42.924 --> 03:43.725
Hello, Lauren.

03:43.758 --> 03:44.692
Nice to see you again.

03:44.726 --> 03:45.626
Oh, my fucking God.

03:45.660 --> 03:47.161
Is that Jessica fucking Bentley?

03:48.029 --> 03:50.230
Yes, she's engaged to Simon.

03:50.263 --> 03:51.833
Simon Hughes?

03:51.866 --> 03:53.067
Fuck off.

03:53.101 --> 03:54.135
Oh my God, he was
so fucking fit.

03:54.168 --> 03:54.969
Is he here?

03:55.002 --> 03:57.505
- No.
- Oh.

04:00.575 --> 04:01.408
Jess.

04:01.441 --> 04:02.342
Tomo.

04:02.375 --> 04:03.211
Tomo.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.078
Tomo.

04:04.112 --> 04:05.278
Tomo.

04:05.312 --> 04:06.246
You lost, mate.

04:06.279 --> 04:07.380
Loser buys the next round.

04:07.414 --> 04:08.950
I've been stitched up here.

04:08.983 --> 04:10.383
You always were a tight ass.

04:10.417 --> 04:11.318
Ah, the prick.

04:11.351 --> 04:12.086
It's all right, Tommy Powell.

04:12.120 --> 04:13.453
I got these.

04:14.321 --> 04:15.355
Oh my God.

04:15.388 --> 04:17.257
Is that Robert Addington?

04:18.159 --> 04:19.292
That's never Jessica Bentley.

04:19.326 --> 04:20.728
Who invited her?

04:20.762 --> 04:21.394
He was a couple of
years above us, wasn't he?

04:21.428 --> 04:22.563
Not our.

04:22.597 --> 04:23.396
Surprised he recognized you.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.533
He's Simon's best man.

04:25.566 --> 04:26.466
Oh.

04:26.501 --> 04:27.935
Right okay, that makes sense.

04:27.969 --> 04:29.904
So you made it inside then.

04:29.937 --> 04:32.439
You're mate turn up?

04:32.472 --> 04:33.373
Not yet.

04:33.406 --> 04:34.842
Jessica fucking Bentley.

04:34.876 --> 04:36.144
Un fucking believable.

04:36.177 --> 04:36.978
I know.

04:37.011 --> 04:37.845
It's crazy, isn't it?

04:38.880 --> 04:39.680
Sorry guys.

04:39.714 --> 04:40.615
I've just.

04:40.648 --> 04:42.083
I've gotta go and do something.

04:44.317 --> 04:45.285
Should we have a bevy?

04:45.318 --> 04:46.286
Yeah, loved to.

04:46.319 --> 04:47.555
Loved to.

04:47.588 --> 04:48.990
Don't you dare tell
me you're not coming.

04:49.023 --> 04:50.490
Simon, why didn't
you call me earlier?

04:50.525 --> 04:52.860
It was a three hour drive.

04:55.530 --> 04:56.898
I'm sorry.

04:56.931 --> 04:57.732
Look, I didn't mean to yell.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.233
It's just.

04:59.267 --> 05:00.902
I don't know if I can stay
here with these people.

05:00.935 --> 05:02.703
Simon, they haven't changed.

05:02.737 --> 05:04.672
It's like being back
at school again.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.278
Of course I haven't had a drink.

05:12.246 --> 05:13.380
Okay, I'll see you at home.

05:13.413 --> 05:15.448
Just call me when
you're on your way back.

05:15.482 --> 05:16.884
All right, okay, I love you.

05:27.528 --> 05:28.529
Jess.

05:41.509 --> 05:42.777
It's Nathan.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.612
We were in chess club together.

05:44.645 --> 05:47.014
I just wanted to say
hi before you left.

05:47.048 --> 05:48.516
I'm not leaving.

05:48.549 --> 05:49.750
Great.

05:49.784 --> 05:51.384
I mean, it's great
you're not leaving.

05:51.418 --> 05:53.353
I'm happy you're staying
like everyone else will be.

05:53.386 --> 05:54.822
The more the merrier, right?

05:55.690 --> 05:56.489
Am I making this weird?

05:56.524 --> 05:57.625
I'm making this weird.

05:57.658 --> 05:58.826
I'm gonna stop talking now.

05:58.860 --> 06:00.595
I remember you
from chess club now.

06:02.997 --> 06:04.632
Can we go back inside?

06:06.133 --> 06:06.934
Let's go back inside.

06:06.968 --> 06:08.703
After you.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.907
Three tours.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.609
I did three tours.

06:14.642 --> 06:16.443
The three tours was enough.

06:16.476 --> 06:18.980
The last one ended when my
buddy Mark triggered an IED.

06:20.648 --> 06:22.783
I was looking right at
it when it went off.

06:24.451 --> 06:26.654
Some things no man
should have to see.

06:26.687 --> 06:29.690
You wanna try working
down here on a Friday night?

06:29.724 --> 06:31.424
I was the only
one who survived.

06:36.463 --> 06:39.233
Why would anyone
in their right mind

06:39.267 --> 06:40.968
attend a school reunion?

06:41.002 --> 06:43.470
Let the past be the past I say.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.273
Yeah, it's a laugh, innit it?

06:45.306 --> 06:47.909
You get pissed that
everyone remembers

06:47.942 --> 06:49.076
how much they hated each other

06:49.110 --> 06:52.146
and then you can
work off the hangover

06:52.179 --> 06:53.748
over spot of a paintball
in the morning.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.283
You're going to the quarry?

06:55.316 --> 06:57.551
That's where the
paintball is then, yeah.

06:58.653 --> 07:00.154
You've been there?

07:00.187 --> 07:01.989
Worked as a driller for
a season back in the day.

07:03.190 --> 07:05.393
I lost my car there.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.195
You lost your
car at the quarry?

07:09.429 --> 07:10.831
You want me to look for it?

07:10.865 --> 07:12.700
There was a young
man named Bill.

07:12.733 --> 07:15.169
He walked up to me one
lunchtime and he said,

07:15.202 --> 07:18.606
he'd seen death in the quarry
and death had looked at him

07:18.639 --> 07:20.141
and made a threatening gesture.

07:20.174 --> 07:22.176
Did you say Jeff?

07:22.209 --> 07:24.045
He wanted to borrow the car

07:24.078 --> 07:25.579
so he could drive
to Stoke-On-Trent.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.248
It was from there, you see,

07:27.281 --> 07:29.917
that he reckoned
he'd be safe there

07:29.951 --> 07:32.253
because no one ever goes to
Stoke-On-Trent on purpose.

07:32.286 --> 07:33.354
That's true.

07:34.789 --> 07:38.125
And he was looking so scared,
I didn't question further.

07:38.159 --> 07:39.860
I just handed him the car keys.

07:41.228 --> 07:43.998
But when I went back to work,
I saw that he was right.

07:44.031 --> 07:45.132
There she was.

07:46.801 --> 07:47.935
So.

07:47.969 --> 07:48.769
Wait.

07:48.803 --> 07:50.237
Jeff's a woman?

07:50.271 --> 07:54.041
So I approached death
and I said to her,

07:54.075 --> 07:57.979
why did you make a threatening
gesture to my friend Bill?

07:58.012 --> 08:01.315
And she said, that was
no threatening gesture.

08:02.216 --> 08:04.685
That was a start of surprise.

08:05.886 --> 08:09.056
I was amazed to see
him here in the quarry

08:09.090 --> 08:13.761
as we have an appointment
tonight in Stoke-on-Trent.

08:16.097 --> 08:17.465
So, what are you drinking?

08:21.168 --> 08:22.169
What are you up to now, mate?

08:22.203 --> 08:23.671
I'm a doctor too, yeah.

08:23.704 --> 08:24.505
Really?

08:24.538 --> 08:26.040
What kind of doctor?

08:26.073 --> 08:26.974
An eye doctor.

08:27.008 --> 08:28.376
You know, glasses and shit.

08:28.409 --> 08:30.244
You mean you're an optician?

08:30.277 --> 08:31.579
Nah, bro.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.180
I'm an ophthalmologist.

08:33.214 --> 08:34.382
You get me?

08:35.282 --> 08:36.350
Whatever.

08:41.022 --> 08:42.156
Tell you what?

08:42.189 --> 08:43.357
I do you deal.

08:44.925 --> 08:46.127
Recognize her?

08:46.160 --> 08:47.228
Should I?

08:49.196 --> 08:50.031
That.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.334
Is Lauren Bryce.

08:54.235 --> 08:56.303
Proper famous she is.

08:56.337 --> 08:57.338
So I tell you what?

08:58.839 --> 09:00.775
You do me a deal with the drinks
for the rest of the night,

09:00.808 --> 09:03.811
and I will get you photo of her.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.848
Imagine how that will look
for you behind the bar.

09:07.882 --> 09:10.418
You and Lauren Bryce.

09:10.451 --> 09:12.653
I could just ask her myself.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.756
Yeah, good luck with that.

09:15.790 --> 09:16.624
Hey, watch this.

09:18.859 --> 09:19.927
Aye, aye.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.896
The Mass Acre Woods crew.

09:21.929 --> 09:24.065
Back together again, huh?

09:24.098 --> 09:26.033
What are the chances?

09:29.804 --> 09:31.205
Yeah.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.073
Cheer to that.

09:33.274 --> 09:35.076
Guess I'll get you
another one, yeah.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.380
There's something that
I always wanted to know.

09:39.413 --> 09:41.449
The whole Christian thing.

09:41.482 --> 09:43.552
You weren't really
into it, were you?

09:43.584 --> 09:44.952
It was a diversion.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.521
- From what?
- Come on.

09:46.555 --> 09:47.755
Pretending you were in sex form.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.090
You were dealing
to half the school.

09:49.123 --> 09:51.358
Ooh, careful, Tommy.

09:51.392 --> 09:52.827
Five 0.

09:52.860 --> 09:54.261
I'm off duty.

09:54.295 --> 09:55.496
Yes, I can't quite believe
you're a cop actually.

09:55.530 --> 09:57.532
Like, did you have
to retake your exams

09:57.566 --> 09:59.600
or did they just
lower their standards?

10:01.068 --> 10:02.504
Oh, ha, ha.

10:02.537 --> 10:04.105
Look, I'm doing what I
always wanted to do, yeah.

10:04.138 --> 10:05.239
At least I'm not making tables.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.373
Making tables?

10:06.407 --> 10:07.675
I wish I got to make tables.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.177
It's just random costume shit.

10:10.211 --> 10:11.312
Some guy requested
I make him this.

10:11.345 --> 10:12.813
Look it's this huge cross.

10:13.948 --> 10:15.584
It's like full life size.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.451
It's for a church or whatever.

10:18.452 --> 10:20.421
I'd love to make a table.

10:20.454 --> 10:22.123
Well then Tommy, you
must be fucking dying

10:22.156 --> 10:24.391
to tell us what you've
been up to these days.

10:24.425 --> 10:26.093
I'm a lifeguard
down in Cornwall.

10:26.127 --> 10:27.828
Oh, and that was
your summer job.

10:27.862 --> 10:29.564
I'm senior lifeguard.

10:29.598 --> 10:32.333
Oh okay, so you're doing
your secondary school

10:32.366 --> 10:34.969
summer job as a career.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.036
Cool.

10:43.210 --> 10:44.178
Thank you.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.849
So, what have you been
up to since school?

10:48.883 --> 10:50.017
I joined the fire service.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.051
That's great.

10:51.085 --> 10:52.286
Not so great.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.387
It didn't really work out.

10:53.420 --> 10:54.455
Oh.

10:54.488 --> 10:55.156
- I could do the job.
- Yeah.

10:56.290 --> 10:57.358
I just saw too much.

10:59.760 --> 11:00.562
What about you?

11:02.597 --> 11:05.634
Simon and I we're
getting married.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.576
Nathan
fucking Campbell.

11:16.744 --> 11:17.945
Didn't see you turn up.

11:17.978 --> 11:18.812
Aiden.

11:20.214 --> 11:22.584
Look at you
sorting yourself out.

11:22.617 --> 11:23.484
Quite strong now.

11:25.786 --> 11:28.923
Got a message from Simon
saying he can't make it.

11:28.956 --> 11:30.824
No, no fucking way.

11:30.858 --> 11:31.992
Calm down, mate.

11:32.026 --> 11:33.427
We wanted to see him, too.

11:33.460 --> 11:34.929
It's not about that.

11:34.962 --> 11:37.097
If Simon ain't here, we're one
short on the paintball team.

11:37.131 --> 11:38.866
That means game over.

11:38.899 --> 11:39.700
Well Jess will do it.

11:39.733 --> 11:40.635
No, she will not.

11:42.436 --> 11:45.039
I came here for the reunion
and I only came here for that

11:45.072 --> 11:46.907
because Simon wanted me to.

11:46.941 --> 11:48.342
Consider us reunited.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.310
Now I'm going home.

11:52.581 --> 11:55.849
As soon as I get someone out
to my car, then I'm going home.

11:55.883 --> 11:56.884
About that.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.319
That ain't gonna happen.

11:59.588 --> 12:01.355
Simon's just signed
you up in his place.

12:01.388 --> 12:02.990
He said you'd be well up for it.

12:03.023 --> 12:03.924
Allow it, yeah.

12:03.958 --> 12:06.060
Simon ain't here, we're fucked.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.629
You're not gonna get
someone to come out

12:07.662 --> 12:09.463
for your car tonight, are you?

12:10.665 --> 12:11.633
Simon had the room
booked to the BNB

12:11.666 --> 12:13.602
so you got somewhere to stay.

12:13.635 --> 12:15.704
Jess, seriously, live
it up a little, will ya?

12:15.736 --> 12:17.871
It's just a game of paintball.

12:17.905 --> 12:19.106
It'll be fun.

12:26.648 --> 12:27.549
You really weren't planning

12:27.582 --> 12:28.882
on coming paintballing, were ya?

12:28.916 --> 12:30.117
No.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.953
My other clothes are in
the car with my keys.

12:32.987 --> 12:34.623
Here, have this.

12:34.656 --> 12:35.690
Thanks.

12:35.724 --> 12:37.124
That's all right.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.492
Here.

12:38.526 --> 12:40.227
It's a shame about Simon.

12:40.261 --> 12:42.896
Probably won't see him
now until well the state.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.798
How's the speech coming along?

12:44.832 --> 12:46.033
It's not.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.602
I'll probably just
wing it anyway.

12:47.636 --> 12:48.902
Oh, here we go.

13:03.317 --> 13:04.852
Morning, team.

13:04.885 --> 13:07.021
How we all doing today?

13:07.054 --> 13:09.658
This one looks a little
bit the worst for wear.

13:09.691 --> 13:11.125
Heavy one last night, was it?

13:12.761 --> 13:13.628
I'm fine.

13:13.662 --> 13:15.095
I can beat the bum.

13:28.576 --> 13:30.911
Reporting for duty, sir.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.449
Right, it's a bit of a drive,

13:35.482 --> 13:37.818
but luckily I've got some
reading material for ya.

13:37.851 --> 13:40.220
Disclaimers, so you
can find out all the ways

13:40.254 --> 13:43.090
in which you are
about to be injured.

13:43.123 --> 13:44.124
Injured.

13:44.158 --> 13:45.059
Wait, wait no minute.

13:45.092 --> 13:47.061
Just sign the bastard forms.

13:48.797 --> 13:49.631
Geez.

13:54.168 --> 13:55.570
Don't know what was in
that curry last night,

13:55.603 --> 13:56.805
but I just shit this morning.

13:56.837 --> 13:58.405
It looked like pea soup
mixed with cat food.

14:12.453 --> 14:13.921
You should try
juice or something.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.222
Ginger ale worked for me.

14:16.423 --> 14:17.391
How long has it been?

14:17.424 --> 14:19.627
Coming on to a year.

14:19.661 --> 14:20.662
It was Simon's idea.

14:21.663 --> 14:23.163
He can see I was overdoing it.

14:24.331 --> 14:25.533
Do you want to quit?

14:25.567 --> 14:26.701
Or is it just he
wants you to quit?

14:27.968 --> 14:28.869
Sorry.

14:28.902 --> 14:29.870
It's none of my business.

14:32.807 --> 14:34.174
Who would
want to live there?

14:34.208 --> 14:36.009
Charming
countryside cottage.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.545
I could sell that.

15:19.987 --> 15:20.889
Right.

15:20.921 --> 15:22.156
Who's done paintballing before?

15:23.691 --> 15:26.226
Well check you out Ned Kelly.

15:26.260 --> 15:28.162
You can show the
others how it's done.

15:29.363 --> 15:31.666
Now, you pass
your phones to Gary.

15:31.699 --> 15:33.167
Why?

15:33.200 --> 15:35.102
So if they get damaged, you
can't say it was our fault.

15:35.135 --> 15:36.805
What if my fiance calls?

15:36.838 --> 15:38.439
Phones.

15:38.472 --> 15:39.306
Now.

15:41.008 --> 15:41.910
All of you.

15:51.118 --> 15:54.021
Right, has anyone had
anything to drink this morning?

15:54.054 --> 15:55.122
I had chai tea latte.

15:55.155 --> 15:55.956
Course you did.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.792
Alcoholic drinks.

16:00.093 --> 16:03.197
Right, anyone got any drugs
or alcohol on their person?

16:04.465 --> 16:05.365
No, we're okay.

16:06.500 --> 16:07.836
Matt's still got a
couple of pints in him.

16:07.869 --> 16:08.803
Don't you, mate?

16:10.738 --> 16:11.539
I'm all right.

16:11.573 --> 16:12.473
Compete with them.

16:12.507 --> 16:13.875
Right, very good.

16:13.908 --> 16:16.210
Your kit is in the
changing room over there.

16:16.243 --> 16:17.846
I am gonna love ya and leave ya

16:17.879 --> 16:19.614
and go and pick
up the other team.

16:19.647 --> 16:20.481
All right.

16:23.551 --> 16:26.987
So, any thoughts on the
team captain then, lads?

16:27.020 --> 16:28.155
I'm captain.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.791
I'm the fucking boss of this.

16:30.758 --> 16:32.660
My team are champions.

16:32.694 --> 16:36.598
Regional champions,
three years running.

16:36.631 --> 16:37.998
This is my thing.

16:38.031 --> 16:40.133
Dan survived three
tours in Afghanistan.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.068
That's right.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.303
That means nothing, bro.

16:43.337 --> 16:46.508
I survived six months
with young offenders.

16:46.541 --> 16:48.877
Paintball is what
stopped me going back.

16:48.910 --> 16:50.043
This is my thing.

16:50.077 --> 16:51.713
This is Brill.

16:53.515 --> 16:55.082
You actually think
that getting shot

16:55.115 --> 16:58.553
by plastic bombs full of
paint is more real than this?

16:58.586 --> 16:59.921
That's where we're different.

16:59.954 --> 17:01.355
You got hit.

17:01.388 --> 17:02.857
All right, all
right, all right.

17:02.891 --> 17:04.057
Who wants Dan as captain?

17:04.091 --> 17:05.527
Raise of hands.

17:05.560 --> 17:06.393
Sorted.

17:07.529 --> 17:09.664
No, I'm not fucking
wearing this shit.

17:09.697 --> 17:11.098
At least yours will fit.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.467
This is the smallest they have.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.770
What the fuck did
you just say to me?

17:15.803 --> 17:17.137
You calling me fucking fat?

17:21.609 --> 17:23.645
Least they have
plenty of pockets.

17:26.748 --> 17:28.115
Oh shit.

17:29.651 --> 17:33.153
You get a good
look, did you, hm?

17:33.186 --> 17:34.756
You fucking perv.

17:34.789 --> 17:36.858
I was tying
my fucking shoelaces.

17:36.891 --> 17:38.560
If you wanted to know
what she looked like,

17:38.593 --> 17:39.561
you could ask me.

17:40.728 --> 17:42.129
Didn't Mr. Hughes
used to catch you

17:42.162 --> 17:45.265
like peeping in the girls
changing room every other week?

17:46.701 --> 17:49.904
Can you guys stop fucking
around so we can do this?

17:54.742 --> 17:55.944
Come on in.

18:07.321 --> 18:08.322
- No.
- Whoa.

18:22.102 --> 18:23.403
They're gonna murder us.

18:26.373 --> 18:27.307
They're all bald.

18:29.343 --> 18:30.243
Hold on.

18:30.277 --> 18:31.779
You're not going out like that.

18:32.981 --> 18:36.383
Who the fuck do you
think you are, my mom?

18:39.621 --> 18:40.788
Ow.

18:40.822 --> 18:43.357
What'd you do that
for, you cunt?

18:48.328 --> 18:51.633
Imagine how that feels
on bare flesh, yeah.

18:51.666 --> 18:54.736
The baggy overalls
are there for reason.

18:54.769 --> 18:57.939
It deflects the shot
and lessens the impact.

18:59.741 --> 19:02.209
We only let people run
around naked on stag days.

19:06.547 --> 19:08.315
You and I are gonna fall out.

19:08.348 --> 19:12.285
Right, you know
we've had a couple of dropouts.

19:12.319 --> 19:14.856
So now we're down to a 10
versus eight situation.

19:14.889 --> 19:16.323
I'd like to even up the teams.

19:16.356 --> 19:17.625
I'll go home.

19:17.659 --> 19:18.559
If that will help.

19:19.493 --> 19:20.862
I'll switch.

19:20.895 --> 19:21.896
You must be joking.

19:21.929 --> 19:23.031
You're our best player.

19:23.064 --> 19:23.865
Tell you what.

19:23.898 --> 19:25.332
We'll do you a deal.

19:25.365 --> 19:28.301
We'll keep Aiden and you
can have Jess and vomit boy.

19:29.403 --> 19:31.105
It's done, bruh.

19:31.139 --> 19:32.006
I'm on their team.

19:32.040 --> 19:32.840
Oh come on, mate.

19:32.874 --> 19:34.042
Did you set this up?

19:34.075 --> 19:34.976
You did, didn't ya?

19:35.009 --> 19:36.209
You've always wanted to try

19:36.243 --> 19:38.780
and beat me at something
ever since school.

19:38.813 --> 19:39.647
Fuck you.

19:39.681 --> 19:41.348
Fat turtle.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.017
Did you just call
him a fat turtle?

19:43.051 --> 19:44.284
All right.

19:44.317 --> 19:47.889
This is a standard
paintball and gun.

19:47.922 --> 19:51.626
You each take one of these
and a full hopper of balls.

19:51.659 --> 19:53.027
I brought my own.

19:53.061 --> 19:54.327
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.130
Is that a B96?

19:56.164 --> 19:57.532
It is, bruv.

19:57.565 --> 19:58.599
Very nice.

19:58.633 --> 20:00.101
No, no, no, no.

20:00.134 --> 20:02.469
You can't use a competition
rifle in an amateur game.

20:02.503 --> 20:03.470
Okay, pal?

20:03.504 --> 20:05.606
It's in house guns only.

20:05.640 --> 20:07.075
We'll lock it up
so it's safe for you

20:07.108 --> 20:08.710
to pick up when you get back.

20:08.743 --> 20:09.811
That'll do.

20:22.590 --> 20:25.292
Soon as we start, I'm
going right for that one

20:25.325 --> 20:27.195
in the fucking eye.

20:28.696 --> 20:29.897
You seem really tense.

20:31.032 --> 20:32.432
Now that's not ideal
when you're about to go

20:32.466 --> 20:33.634
into a combat situation.

20:33.668 --> 20:35.103
Believe me, I've been there.

20:35.136 --> 20:37.572
And more than once don't forget.

20:37.605 --> 20:39.107
I'm trained for this, yeah.

20:39.140 --> 20:40.508
So, let me help you.

20:41.743 --> 20:44.377
Get the fuck off me.

20:44.411 --> 20:47.148
You are never getting
any of this, all right?

20:49.550 --> 20:50.918
Mate, whatever.

21:00.995 --> 21:03.564
Did something
happen with them two?

21:03.598 --> 21:06.234
Something happened
between all of us, Jess.

21:06.266 --> 21:09.537
Look, have you ever seen
"Fast and Furious Four"?

21:10.905 --> 21:13.040
You know, like the one
when Vin Diesel comes back.

21:13.074 --> 21:14.474
You mean the one
he really comes back,

21:14.509 --> 21:16.244
not the last two seconds
of "Tokyo Drift".

21:16.276 --> 21:17.645
Obviously 'cause
fuck that movie.

21:17.678 --> 21:19.412
Are you sure it
wasn't this guy

21:19.446 --> 21:20.681
you remember hanging out with?

21:20.715 --> 21:21.916
"Fast and Furious
Four" happened what

21:21.949 --> 21:24.051
like eight years after
the original movie?

21:24.085 --> 21:27.221
So, Paul Walker and Vin Diesel

21:27.255 --> 21:28.656
haven't seen each
other for eight years.

21:28.689 --> 21:31.259
Eight fucking years, right?

21:31.291 --> 21:32.760
And there's been so
much shit's happened.

21:32.794 --> 21:35.630
Like so much that they can sit
around, crack open a Corona,

21:35.663 --> 21:37.397
and talk about all
the fucking madness

21:37.430 --> 21:38.533
that happened right,
but they don't.

21:38.566 --> 21:40.968
They just get on with it.

21:41.002 --> 21:42.970
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

21:43.004 --> 21:46.874
All I'm saying is, life is
pretty much exactly the same

21:46.908 --> 21:48.776
as the "Fast and
Furious" movies.

21:48.810 --> 21:50.778
Apart from all the
car chases and stuff.

21:52.680 --> 21:54.749
Look Jess, back at
school you definitely

21:54.782 --> 21:56.851
would've ruined all this.

22:03.090 --> 22:06.060
Right okay, health
and safety time.

22:06.093 --> 22:08.529
Guys, shut the fuck up.

22:08.563 --> 22:10.898
This is serious shit.

22:10.932 --> 22:11.999
Ooh.

22:13.167 --> 22:16.704
Right, so masks must
be worn at all times

22:16.737 --> 22:18.539
except in the safe zone.

22:20.208 --> 22:21.509
This is the safe zone.

22:24.779 --> 22:27.148
Anyone seen not wearing a mask

22:27.181 --> 22:30.483
will be ejected from the
site immediately, okay.

22:30.518 --> 22:32.086
Ejected immediately.

22:32.119 --> 22:37.124
Those paintballs travel at
over 200 miles per hour, okay.

22:38.593 --> 22:40.460
If you take a shot to the
eye, it will blind you.

22:40.493 --> 22:43.598
The shock alone could kill you.

22:43.631 --> 22:44.532
Okay?

22:44.565 --> 22:46.267
We play the surrender rule.

22:46.300 --> 22:50.071
But we don't actually enforce
it 'cause it's for pansies.

22:50.104 --> 22:51.539
I guess you're gonna have

22:51.572 --> 22:53.040
to rethink your game
plan, Matty boy.

22:54.642 --> 22:57.477
There is no minimum
distance for engagement.

22:58.646 --> 23:00.413
Please don't go around
shooting each other

23:00.447 --> 23:02.250
at point blank range, okay.

23:02.283 --> 23:04.619
Hey, why don't
you tell her that?

23:04.652 --> 23:07.255
If you have a question,
can you raise your hand

23:07.288 --> 23:08.623
and we'll get to ya?

23:08.656 --> 23:09.489
You cunt.

23:11.424 --> 23:14.161
Same old Lauren still
cursing at the teachers.

23:15.296 --> 23:17.999
When a game is over,
we come back here.

23:18.032 --> 23:20.067
We do a roll call to make sure

23:20.101 --> 23:23.905
we haven't lost any
of you out there.

23:23.938 --> 23:25.172
Question.

23:25.206 --> 23:26.507
Okay, first
game is a death match.

23:26.540 --> 23:28.175
You may take your guns.

23:32.546 --> 23:33.347
Okay, listen.

23:33.381 --> 23:34.181
Here's the plan.

23:34.215 --> 23:35.683
We split into two teams.

23:35.716 --> 23:37.518
Alpha team, you're
gonna lead the charge

23:37.551 --> 23:38.753
straight down the middle.

23:38.786 --> 23:40.988
Basically, you're like
cannon fodder, yeah.

23:41.022 --> 23:44.258
Take cover where you can, but
you're gonna draw their fire.

23:44.292 --> 23:45.760
Beta team.

23:45.793 --> 23:47.762
You're gonna split into
gamma team and delta team.

23:47.795 --> 23:48.696
Wait.

23:48.729 --> 23:50.765
Is that three teams or four?

23:50.798 --> 23:51.966
That's three teams.

23:51.999 --> 23:53.968
Basically gamma
team and delta team,

23:54.001 --> 23:55.202
you're gonna flank them.

23:56.337 --> 23:58.306
That means go
around from behind.

23:59.874 --> 24:01.075
Hold on, hold on.

24:01.108 --> 24:02.310
Who's on what team?

24:02.343 --> 24:04.612
'Cause I don't wanna be
on alpha team at all.

24:04.645 --> 24:05.579
I'll lead alpha team.

24:05.613 --> 24:07.014
Who's coming with me?

24:07.048 --> 24:08.816
Why don't you just say
let's split into three teams?

24:08.849 --> 24:09.650
Fucking hell.

24:09.684 --> 24:10.518
Right.

24:10.551 --> 24:11.852
- Yeah.
- Let's do this.

24:43.483 --> 24:44.752
Right, next game.

24:44.785 --> 24:46.587
Protect the VIP.

24:46.620 --> 24:47.855
Who wants to volunteer?

24:50.925 --> 24:51.859
Right.

24:51.892 --> 24:54.261
You're the VIP.

24:54.295 --> 24:55.329
Oh fuck you.

25:20.955 --> 25:23.357
The next game is
capture the fort.

25:23.391 --> 25:25.726
Attacking team, your mission is

25:25.760 --> 25:29.430
to raise the flag on the fort.

25:29.463 --> 25:30.398
Understood?

25:33.601 --> 25:36.404
How you
liking this, Robbie boy?

25:36.437 --> 25:39.173
Next game, you're going down.

25:43.711 --> 25:45.179
Guns now.

25:45.212 --> 25:46.747
I vote we just stand in two
lines and shoot each other.

25:46.781 --> 25:48.649
It'll be quicker
and less painful.

25:48.682 --> 25:49.817
No.

25:49.850 --> 25:51.886
No, we're gonna
fucking win this one.

25:51.919 --> 25:53.621
I've never let that dickhead
beat me at anything in school.

25:53.654 --> 25:55.322
And I'm not.

25:55.356 --> 25:57.324
I am not gonna start now.

26:01.996 --> 26:02.763
There he is.

26:02.797 --> 26:03.597
Spread out.

26:03.631 --> 26:04.465
Get down.

26:06.400 --> 26:07.768
What's the plan?

26:07.802 --> 26:09.236
We keep it simple.

26:09.270 --> 26:10.604
Two groups.

26:10.638 --> 26:11.705
Just keep your cool.

26:11.739 --> 26:12.640
Stay alert.

26:12.673 --> 26:13.774
Take it slow.

26:13.808 --> 26:14.909
We got this one, guys.

26:21.048 --> 26:21.816
Get down.

26:21.849 --> 26:22.683
Keep low.

26:23.684 --> 26:24.519
Jess, down.

26:25.920 --> 26:28.155
Rob, you push forward to that
next set of blue barrels.

26:28.189 --> 26:29.256
You have range there.

26:29.290 --> 26:30.958
We'll lay down cover and fire.

26:30.991 --> 26:34.061
Covering fire guys
on three, two, one.

26:48.242 --> 26:50.611
Go, go, go, go, go.

26:50.644 --> 26:51.445
Push forward.

26:51.479 --> 26:52.680
Are you ready?

26:53.981 --> 26:54.782
Go.

27:01.322 --> 27:03.124
Jess, what are you doing?

27:03.157 --> 27:04.058
Get down.

27:04.091 --> 27:04.992
They're not firing back.

27:05.025 --> 27:06.460
Jess, it's a trap.

27:06.494 --> 27:07.962
Maybe they've run out of ammo.

27:13.834 --> 27:15.469
They'd have definitely
shot us by now.

27:16.370 --> 27:18.205
What they planning at?

27:19.608 --> 27:22.943
There's no rule against
not shooting your gun.

27:24.879 --> 27:26.280
It's totally a trap.

27:27.748 --> 27:29.150
There's only one
way to find out.

27:29.183 --> 27:31.018
Jess, are you crazy?

27:31.051 --> 27:32.253
Do you want out of
the game or something?

27:32.286 --> 27:33.687
Of course I want
out of the game.

27:33.721 --> 27:35.289
I want to go home.

27:36.290 --> 27:37.725
Ah, fuck this.

27:49.970 --> 27:51.540
What the fuck?

27:58.812 --> 28:00.281
Okay guys, you can get up now.

28:00.314 --> 28:01.782
We've got ya.

28:10.124 --> 28:11.325
Whoa.

28:16.197 --> 28:17.131
Lame.

28:17.164 --> 28:19.333
Doesn't even look real.

28:19.366 --> 28:22.236
One of them prank
shows, innit it?

28:22.269 --> 28:23.270
It has to be.

28:23.304 --> 28:24.606
Where's the camera?

28:25.873 --> 28:28.008
This is obviously a hack job.

28:31.513 --> 28:32.346
Guys.

28:33.180 --> 28:34.014
She's dead.

28:35.950 --> 28:38.786
Dan, what do we do?

28:38.819 --> 28:40.522
Nah fuck off, this is a prank.

28:44.593 --> 28:45.960
It's real.

28:45.993 --> 28:47.428
No, Aiden set us up.

28:49.263 --> 28:50.197
Mate.

28:53.100 --> 28:54.735
We need to call Simon.

28:54.768 --> 28:56.504
He'll know what to do.

29:03.978 --> 29:05.346
You should
come away from him.

29:05.379 --> 29:07.047
Look at this shit.

29:07.081 --> 29:10.518
His fucking throat's
hanging out.

29:10.552 --> 29:11.885
Damn, wish I had my phone.

29:11.919 --> 29:14.288
This would totally be
going up on my insta.

29:14.321 --> 29:15.322
I wanna go home now.

29:18.125 --> 29:21.328
I wanna fucking go home now.

29:21.362 --> 29:22.196
Matt's right.

29:23.297 --> 29:24.231
It's not safe here.

29:25.132 --> 29:26.166
We need to leave now.

29:27.636 --> 29:28.469
Marshall.

29:29.803 --> 29:30.639
Marshall.

29:32.873 --> 29:34.441
Marshall Shelly.

29:34.475 --> 29:35.376
I can't see her.

29:35.409 --> 29:37.111
Maybe she ran over for help.

29:37.144 --> 29:38.312
We just need to
get out of here now.

29:38.345 --> 29:39.446
You're police.

29:39.480 --> 29:40.180
You should be telling
us what to do.

29:40.214 --> 29:41.382
I'm off duty.

29:41.415 --> 29:42.349
You must have
some idea what to do

29:42.383 --> 29:43.917
in a situation like this surely.

29:43.951 --> 29:45.587
Listen, you saw what
he did in there, yeah.

29:45.620 --> 29:47.756
We run it back with
playbook for fuck's sake.

29:47.821 --> 29:48.690
We're fucked.

29:48.723 --> 29:50.291
No, we go back to the base.

29:50.324 --> 29:51.225
It's not far from here.

29:51.258 --> 29:52.594
Whoever did this knows that.

29:52.627 --> 29:54.328
He'll be going there as well.

29:54.361 --> 29:55.195
Enough.

29:56.564 --> 29:57.998
Stay calm, focus.

29:59.300 --> 30:02.169
I need you to find
solutions, not more problems.

30:02.202 --> 30:04.204
We go back to the
base and we deal with

30:04.238 --> 30:06.407
whoever comes up along the way,

30:06.440 --> 30:07.975
but you stay calm, all right.

30:11.613 --> 30:13.981
That goes for the rest of ya.

30:14.014 --> 30:15.583
Come on, guys.

30:15.617 --> 30:16.850
We survived secondary school.

30:16.884 --> 30:18.586
We can survive this.

30:18.620 --> 30:19.420
He's right.

30:19.453 --> 30:20.722
He's right.

30:46.581 --> 30:48.449
It's Aiden.

30:48.482 --> 30:50.050
Fuck, that's sick.

30:51.385 --> 30:52.554
They took his armor.

30:53.655 --> 30:55.824
Guys, check this out.

30:56.924 --> 30:58.325
Does that mean we won then?

30:58.359 --> 30:59.561
Please don't tell me

30:59.594 --> 31:00.961
that was an actual
thought you just had.

31:01.830 --> 31:02.597
Ah.

31:03.732 --> 31:04.599
Fuck, I been hit.

31:04.632 --> 31:05.567
I've been hit.

31:05.600 --> 31:06.967
Guys, get to cover.

31:09.002 --> 31:09.838
Gun.

31:11.573 --> 31:12.741
Get to cover.

31:12.774 --> 31:14.509
Get behind those trees.

31:15.777 --> 31:19.079
Matt, get behind
that fucking tree.

31:20.414 --> 31:21.315
Matt.

31:21.348 --> 31:22.883
Behind the fucking tree.

31:22.916 --> 31:24.385
It fucking hurts.

31:24.418 --> 31:25.452
Hold on, Matt.

31:25.486 --> 31:26.387
Fuck are you doing?

31:26.420 --> 31:27.756
Are you stupid?

31:28.757 --> 31:29.724
Shit, he's bleeding.

31:29.758 --> 31:31.291
Just put pressure on it.

31:31.325 --> 31:32.226
You said you was a lifeguard.

31:32.259 --> 31:33.494
Don't you know first aid?

31:33.528 --> 31:34.729
Don't get me gunshot
wounds at the seaside.

31:34.763 --> 31:35.663
Let me take a look.

31:35.697 --> 31:36.397
Oh, you're a doctor, too?

31:36.430 --> 31:37.264
I'm a fireman.

31:39.133 --> 31:39.967
How bad is it?

31:40.000 --> 31:41.168
Just let me see.

31:41.201 --> 31:42.002
He's got a bullet in him.

31:42.035 --> 31:43.237
We need to get this out.

31:43.270 --> 31:45.172
No, no, just focus on
stopping the bleeding.

31:45.205 --> 31:48.108
My god, will you
just get him to cover.

31:48.142 --> 31:48.942
Wait.

31:50.612 --> 31:51.546
It's a paintball.

31:51.579 --> 31:52.647
They're not firing bullets.

31:52.680 --> 31:53.480
He's right.

31:54.682 --> 31:55.482
It's not a bullet wound.

31:55.517 --> 31:56.551
It's just paint.

31:56.584 --> 31:57.786
You'll be fine.

31:57.819 --> 31:59.587
It fucking hurt
like a bullet wound.

31:59.621 --> 32:01.288
It's just from pain.

32:01.321 --> 32:02.923
Well who is it?

32:02.956 --> 32:06.260
Can anybody see
who's shooting at us?

32:06.293 --> 32:07.995
I think they've stopped now.

32:09.963 --> 32:12.600
If they wanted us dead,
they wouldn't be firing at us

32:12.634 --> 32:15.002
with fucking
paintballs, would they?

32:15.035 --> 32:16.336
I told you it was a prank.

32:18.472 --> 32:19.641
It's you, isn't it?

32:19.674 --> 32:20.974
All of it?

32:21.008 --> 32:21.876
The bodies.

32:21.910 --> 32:23.177
This makeup job.

32:23.210 --> 32:24.679
You set us up.

32:24.712 --> 32:25.513
Rob.

32:25.547 --> 32:26.346
Get away from here.

32:26.380 --> 32:27.181
Come here.

32:27.214 --> 32:28.215
Oh come on now.

32:28.248 --> 32:29.016
Have your fucking laugh.

32:29.049 --> 32:30.250
Go on, you've earned it.

32:30.284 --> 32:32.887
Rob, mate, we
need to get home.

32:32.921 --> 32:34.288
I've practiced on
dummies more real than this

32:34.321 --> 32:35.723
in fucking medical school.

32:36.591 --> 32:37.391
Last chance, Aiden.

32:37.424 --> 32:39.092
Rob, leave it.

32:39.126 --> 32:41.361
Come on, I'll buy you a beer.

32:41.395 --> 32:42.664
Oh.

32:47.434 --> 32:48.235
They've killed him.

32:48.268 --> 32:49.470
They fucking killed him.

32:49.504 --> 32:50.337
Mate.

32:51.539 --> 32:52.473
He was my friend.

32:53.842 --> 32:54.876
There's nothing we
can do for him now.

32:54.909 --> 32:55.710
No, just.

32:57.344 --> 32:58.580
He didn't deserve this.

33:04.619 --> 33:06.353
I'm gonna find the
bastard that did this.

33:06.386 --> 33:07.221
You'll see.

33:07.254 --> 33:08.188
Rob.

33:08.222 --> 33:09.691
Rob.

33:09.724 --> 33:11.559
No, if he wants to run off
on his own, then let him,

33:11.593 --> 33:13.026
but we need to stay together.

33:13.060 --> 33:14.294
You can fuck off.

33:14.328 --> 33:15.663
I'm going after him.

33:15.697 --> 33:16.898
Who's coming with me?

33:16.931 --> 33:18.398
The best chance
we've got right now

33:18.432 --> 33:21.235
is to get our phones back
so we can call for help.

33:21.268 --> 33:24.071
I thought in the Army no
one got left behind, huh.

33:26.139 --> 33:27.575
Or don't you follow that rule?

33:27.609 --> 33:29.343
Is that how you
survived three tours

33:29.376 --> 33:31.044
and none of your men did?

33:31.078 --> 33:32.279
Oh, it's like that, is it?

33:32.312 --> 33:34.214
I'm leading the
others to safety.

33:34.248 --> 33:35.082
Let's go.

33:37.552 --> 33:39.386
Oh so what that's it then?

33:39.419 --> 33:40.922
None of you is
gonna come with me?

33:40.955 --> 33:43.123
You're gonna let Rob face
some psycho on his own?

33:46.828 --> 33:48.028
Wait.

33:48.061 --> 33:49.029
I'll come with you.

33:50.264 --> 33:52.432
Thought you
wanted to get home.

33:52.466 --> 33:55.837
Simon would never forgive me
if I let his best man behind.

34:00.608 --> 34:02.209
What do you think there, Matt?

34:02.242 --> 34:03.343
Terrorists?

34:03.377 --> 34:05.212
Any paintball protestors?

34:05.245 --> 34:07.114
Come on, you're the detective.

34:07.147 --> 34:08.115
Yeah, but I'm-

34:08.148 --> 34:09.551
- Off duty.
- Off duty.

34:09.584 --> 34:11.118
Yeah, we get to the
phones and we call for help.

34:11.151 --> 34:13.086
Then we can figure out
what this is all about.

34:13.120 --> 34:14.254
That's the plan agreed?

34:15.355 --> 34:17.859
You're fucking
loving this, aren't ya?

34:17.892 --> 34:20.127
A good soldier adapts
to any situation.

34:20.160 --> 34:21.529
I'm adapting.

34:21.563 --> 34:23.531
You're a walking
recruitment video.

34:23.565 --> 34:24.498
Fucking loving it.

34:24.532 --> 34:26.000
Swear it, mate.

34:26.034 --> 34:27.635
You'll be thanking me when
I get us out of this one.

34:27.669 --> 34:28.703
Hey, I saw someone.

34:28.736 --> 34:29.571
Tommy, no.

34:37.244 --> 34:38.580
Is that booze?

34:47.922 --> 34:49.791
So what happened to
you after school?

34:50.925 --> 34:52.594
You like running the
world now or something?

34:52.627 --> 34:53.928
Doing all the sciences.

34:53.962 --> 34:56.096
Making all the laws.

34:56.129 --> 34:57.431
I'm a psychiatric nurse.

34:58.566 --> 34:59.399
Nurse?

35:02.503 --> 35:05.138
No, no, I mean that's
very noble and everything.

35:05.172 --> 35:08.208
It just seems a bit
beneath the mighty,

35:08.241 --> 35:11.311
all knowing Jessica
Bentley, innit it?

35:11.345 --> 35:12.513
God, you used to think you were

35:12.547 --> 35:13.380
so much better than
the rest of us.

35:13.413 --> 35:14.949
I never thought that.

35:14.983 --> 35:16.884
You just used to
think I thought that.

35:18.318 --> 35:19.587
All right.

35:19.621 --> 35:22.289
Jessica Bentley,
psychiatric nurse.

35:23.625 --> 35:24.592
What's your professional opinion

35:24.626 --> 35:26.193
on what happened here today?

35:26.226 --> 35:27.528
We're in shock.

35:27.562 --> 35:28.796
All of us.

35:28.830 --> 35:30.565
And the only person
that really took on

35:30.598 --> 35:32.399
what happened back
there was Rob,

35:32.432 --> 35:34.234
which is why he
needs the most help.

35:38.338 --> 35:39.439
Hey, over here.

35:43.410 --> 35:44.411
Come on.

35:44.444 --> 35:45.245
I'm investigating.

35:45.278 --> 35:46.480
They're shooting at us.

35:46.514 --> 35:47.414
Then he already
knows we're here

35:47.447 --> 35:49.216
without you shouting him over.

35:49.249 --> 35:50.585
He's gone.

35:50.618 --> 35:51.586
We should go after him.

35:51.619 --> 35:52.854
And do what?

35:52.887 --> 35:53.821
Paintball him to death?

35:53.855 --> 35:55.188
Are you taking the piss?

35:55.222 --> 35:56.323
I'm just saying.

35:57.525 --> 35:59.761
Look whoever it is has
killed what 10 people.

35:59.794 --> 36:01.062
We need to think about
what we're gonna do

36:01.095 --> 36:02.664
if we run into him.

36:02.697 --> 36:04.532
You always were
a pussy, Campbell.

36:04.565 --> 36:06.400
Fireman my fucking ass.

36:07.602 --> 36:08.803
Least I've got a
real grownup job.

36:08.836 --> 36:09.837
What the fuck
did you just say?

36:09.871 --> 36:10.938
Tommy.

36:10.972 --> 36:12.339
You think you're the big man

36:12.372 --> 36:14.075
'cause you done some
fucking first aid workshop?

36:14.108 --> 36:16.410
Tommy, just leave it.

36:16.443 --> 36:17.845
This is stupid.

36:17.879 --> 36:21.149
That could be some idiot
walking his dog for all we know.

36:21.181 --> 36:22.249
We stick to the plan.

36:25.787 --> 36:28.221
Would do you think Simon
would make of all this?

36:28.255 --> 36:30.357
Simon's more
suspicious than I am.

36:30.390 --> 36:32.359
What you think he'd
be suspicious of?

36:33.561 --> 36:35.295
Simon would be more
suspicious of the ones

36:35.328 --> 36:37.197
who seem to be
enjoying themselves.

36:37.230 --> 36:38.132
Like Dan.

36:38.166 --> 36:39.667
And you.

36:39.701 --> 36:40.902
Is that a house?

36:42.235 --> 36:43.270
I recognize this tree line.

36:43.303 --> 36:44.906
It's not far now, guys.

36:44.939 --> 36:46.507
My hero.

36:46.541 --> 36:48.676
It's all part of
my training, love.

36:48.710 --> 36:50.044
I was taking the piss.

36:50.078 --> 36:51.478
I could've got us back here.

36:53.380 --> 36:55.449
I'm trying to lead us
to fucking safety here.

36:55.482 --> 36:58.052
What, by mansplaining
a fucking 10 yard stroll

36:58.086 --> 36:59.453
through the fucking woods?

36:59.486 --> 37:00.387
Fuck me, Dan.

37:00.420 --> 37:01.856
That's so impressive.

37:01.889 --> 37:03.423
We'd be lost out
here for fucking ever

37:03.457 --> 37:06.627
if it wasn't for you to show
us how to walk 10 fucking yards

37:06.661 --> 37:09.296
in the fucking direction
we just fucking came from.

37:09.329 --> 37:11.032
I'm sure it's not the time
or the place, all right.

37:11.065 --> 37:12.934
Oh fuck you if
you're gonna take his side.

37:12.967 --> 37:14.434
Wow.

37:14.468 --> 37:15.268
I reckon this prick was
the one that set it all up.

37:15.302 --> 37:16.204
Wow.

37:16.236 --> 37:17.638
You get booted out of the army

37:17.672 --> 37:18.706
and you think you're
impress your school crush

37:18.740 --> 37:19.807
by playing the big man.

37:19.841 --> 37:21.042
Is that what you think?

37:21.075 --> 37:23.144
Is that what you really
fucking think, is it?

37:23.177 --> 37:24.512
Then why don't you
lead the fucking way?

37:24.545 --> 37:25.613
Go on.

37:25.646 --> 37:26.480
- All right, fine.
- Fine.

37:30.484 --> 37:31.853
Oh fuck.

37:31.886 --> 37:34.555
Guys, nobody move.

37:50.370 --> 37:52.039
Dan, what do we do?

37:52.073 --> 37:53.373
I don't think it's armed.

37:53.406 --> 37:55.676
How do you know?

37:55.710 --> 37:58.679
When you step on a
landmine, it blows up.

37:58.713 --> 38:00.047
You heard the click, right?

38:01.582 --> 38:03.551
I think this one's
defective or not on.

38:04.986 --> 38:06.854
How confident are you, mate?

38:09.690 --> 38:10.558
75.

38:13.027 --> 38:14.529
70%.

38:19.967 --> 38:22.069
We're leaving you, Dan.

38:23.237 --> 38:26.339
There might be more,
so be careful yeah.

38:27.575 --> 38:28.776
Here's the plan.

38:28.810 --> 38:31.112
I'm gonna count back
from 10 and then.

38:33.648 --> 38:35.883
What the fuck are you doing?

38:35.917 --> 38:37.885
I'm not waiting around
for you to drag this out.

38:37.919 --> 38:38.820
I've got shit to do.

38:38.853 --> 38:40.688
She's fucking crazy, man.

38:41.789 --> 38:43.558
That fucking hurt.

38:43.591 --> 38:44.959
You didn't explode.

38:44.992 --> 38:46.294
So there's that.

38:49.329 --> 38:51.464
Nathan's right.

38:51.498 --> 38:52.900
I didn't explode.

38:54.635 --> 38:58.105
That's the fourth explosive
device that I've triggered

38:58.139 --> 38:59.507
and it hasn't fucking killed me.

38:59.540 --> 39:01.676
This is a fucking miracle.

39:01.709 --> 39:04.312
This is some sort of divine
intervention going on here.

39:06.047 --> 39:07.248
This is great.

39:07.281 --> 39:09.050
I'm glad you found
God or whatever,

39:09.083 --> 39:10.751
but should we be
concerned about the fact

39:10.785 --> 39:13.955
there's a landmine on the
only path out of here?

39:13.988 --> 39:15.756
It's not the only path.

39:15.790 --> 39:17.692
We're out at open countryside.

39:17.725 --> 39:18.860
Fuck off.

39:18.893 --> 39:20.427
We're not taking another path.

39:20.460 --> 39:21.262
We're going this way.

39:21.295 --> 39:22.495
We continue here.

39:22.530 --> 39:23.831
Down this trail,
we'll be killed.

39:25.533 --> 39:26.901
I know your scared, Matt.

39:28.302 --> 39:31.639
Every man's scared in their
first action, but the real hero.

39:32.773 --> 39:34.441
The real hero is
the one who goes on

39:34.474 --> 39:35.676
even though he's scared.

39:36.978 --> 39:38.946
The real man never
lets his fear of death

39:38.980 --> 39:41.749
overpower his sense of honor
and duty to his teammates.

39:43.985 --> 39:44.819
We go on.

39:45.853 --> 39:47.822
Mate, it's paintball.

39:47.855 --> 39:50.390
I mean I know it's
fucked up what happened,

39:50.423 --> 39:51.859
but it's not fucking war, is it?

39:51.893 --> 39:54.629
When you got paintballs
flying all around you

39:54.662 --> 39:56.664
and you wipe the
dirt from your face

39:56.697 --> 39:59.967
and you realize that's not dirt.

40:00.001 --> 40:02.303
That's the blood and
guts of your best friend.

40:03.337 --> 40:04.505
You'll know I'm right.

40:06.340 --> 40:08.576
You'll know we've got to go on.

40:08.609 --> 40:10.011
Guys.

40:10.044 --> 40:10.845
Get with me.

40:10.878 --> 40:11.679
Come on.

40:11.712 --> 40:12.780
The next round's on me.

40:19.687 --> 40:21.789
Oh my god.

40:21.822 --> 40:22.990
It's on my arm.

40:23.024 --> 40:23.858
It's on my arm.

40:25.359 --> 40:26.360
He seemed so sure.

40:52.954 --> 40:53.988
Rob?

41:01.295 --> 41:02.830
Are you in here?

41:08.035 --> 41:10.004
Maybe there's a light switch.

41:10.037 --> 41:11.739
I'll keep watch out here.

41:11.772 --> 41:12.807
You look for the light switch.

41:12.840 --> 41:14.942
Are you afraid of the dark?

41:14.976 --> 41:15.776
I'm not afraid.

41:15.810 --> 41:17.078
I just don't like it.

41:17.111 --> 41:18.746
Sell it to me.

41:18.779 --> 41:22.717
You said you could sell
anything, so sell me this place.

41:24.885 --> 41:25.720
The dark.

41:27.021 --> 41:27.888
What is that?

41:27.922 --> 41:29.390
Full of character?

41:29.423 --> 41:30.257
Atmosphere.

41:31.192 --> 41:32.693
We say and heaps of atmosphere.

41:32.727 --> 41:33.627
Go on.

41:45.272 --> 41:47.375
Concrete floors
by the sound of it.

41:48.676 --> 41:49.744
Doesn't damage easily.

42:07.695 --> 42:10.698
The previous owner left antique
furniture in the property,

42:11.866 --> 42:14.301
including this Edwardian
ping pong table.

42:14.335 --> 42:15.236
Ping pong?

42:15.269 --> 42:16.070
It has to be.

42:16.103 --> 42:17.772
I found a ball.

42:17.805 --> 42:19.206
I found a lamp.

42:20.808 --> 42:21.942
What about these?

42:21.976 --> 42:25.312
Modern
kitchen facilities.

42:25.346 --> 42:27.181
Oh, this table's wet.

42:29.617 --> 42:31.719
I don't think this
is a ping pong table.

42:34.388 --> 42:35.456
Oh fuck.

42:37.526 --> 42:40.127
At least we know what
happened to Aiden's eyes.

42:42.930 --> 42:45.232
You seem remarkably
calm about all this.

42:46.967 --> 42:47.935
I just threw a
human eyeball at you

42:47.968 --> 42:49.837
and you didn't even flinch.

42:49.870 --> 42:52.306
I told you what
I do for a living.

42:52.339 --> 42:53.574
Trust me.

42:53.607 --> 42:56.610
I've had worse things
thrown at me than that.

42:56.644 --> 42:59.246
Well, maybe not worse
but pretty disgusting.

42:59.280 --> 43:00.648
What are you doing with that?

43:04.385 --> 43:05.352
Where are you going?

43:05.386 --> 43:06.620
Back to the others.

43:06.654 --> 43:07.455
We shouldn't be on
our own out here.

43:07.488 --> 43:08.656
What about Rob?

43:08.689 --> 43:09.790
Why don't you stay
and wait for him, yeah?

43:09.824 --> 43:10.991
Yeah, that's a good idea.

43:11.025 --> 43:12.293
Just said we shouldn't
be here on our own.

43:12.326 --> 43:14.361
You literally just said that.

43:20.101 --> 43:20.968
Ben.

43:29.710 --> 43:30.545
No.

43:33.614 --> 43:34.583
Ah.

43:51.966 --> 43:53.100
Ah.

45:51.018 --> 45:52.621
Fuck, fuck, we're fucked.

45:54.623 --> 45:57.224
He was our only chance
of getting out of here.

45:57.258 --> 46:00.494
Mate I don't wanna disrespect
your mental health situation

46:00.528 --> 46:02.029
but having an anxiety
attack right now,

46:02.062 --> 46:03.632
it's really distracting
when I'm trying not

46:03.665 --> 46:05.833
to stand on a fucking landmine.

46:11.338 --> 46:14.676
Hey, has anyone seen Sara?

46:14.709 --> 46:17.111
Did anyone see where she went?

46:20.047 --> 46:21.282
You're a police officer.

46:21.315 --> 46:23.752
You're supposed to be
looking out for us.

46:23.784 --> 46:25.520
God, no wonder this
country's fucked.

46:25.553 --> 46:26.588
I bet you've always remained.

46:26.621 --> 46:27.855
Right.

46:27.888 --> 46:29.691
You want me to get
us out of here?

46:29.724 --> 46:32.627
We gotta get out of this
fucking minefield first.

46:32.661 --> 46:34.194
Well come on, follow me.

46:34.228 --> 46:35.029
Come on.

46:35.062 --> 46:36.665
Hey.

46:36.698 --> 46:38.600
I suppose I'll go
look for her then.

46:39.800 --> 46:41.368
Fine.

46:41.402 --> 46:42.570
We'll wait here.

46:42.604 --> 46:43.672
Like fuck we will.

46:47.107 --> 46:48.108
Fuck.

46:58.452 --> 46:59.286
He's gone.

47:00.454 --> 47:01.656
He must be looking
for the others.

47:01.690 --> 47:03.257
He killed Ben.

47:03.290 --> 47:04.158
Yeah, I saw.

47:05.326 --> 47:06.827
We should go and
help the others.

47:06.860 --> 47:08.395
I need to call Simon.

47:08.429 --> 47:11.332
Simon's not
gonna help you now.

47:11.365 --> 47:13.200
What's that supposed to mean?

47:13.233 --> 47:15.069
I need to show you something.

47:20.007 --> 47:21.075
Don't remember
this path, mate.

47:21.108 --> 47:21.909
This is the way.

47:21.942 --> 47:23.410
I'm positive.

47:23.444 --> 47:25.045
I know this isn't right.

47:25.079 --> 47:27.147
And I also know that
you were shit scared

47:27.181 --> 47:28.482
of going back to base camp

47:28.516 --> 47:30.918
in case the killer
was waiting for us.

47:30.951 --> 47:33.320
I think he's sending us
the wrong way on purpose.

47:33.354 --> 47:34.488
You think I'm scared?

47:34.522 --> 47:35.422
Yeah, mate.

47:35.456 --> 47:37.257
I think you're a fucking coward.

47:37.291 --> 47:38.125
Okay.

47:39.259 --> 47:40.829
Come on in.

47:40.861 --> 47:41.663
Come on in, you wanker.

47:41.696 --> 47:42.496
Come on.

47:42.530 --> 47:43.665
Come and get me.

47:43.698 --> 47:44.498
Come on.

47:44.532 --> 47:45.332
Come on.

47:45.366 --> 47:46.200
Fuck.

47:46.233 --> 47:47.067
Shit.

47:50.772 --> 47:51.673
Matt.

47:51.706 --> 47:52.906
Get me out of here.

47:52.940 --> 47:54.141
It's too far.

47:54.174 --> 47:56.377
You need to get
me out of here now.

47:56.410 --> 47:57.645
You need to get me
out of here now.

47:57.679 --> 47:58.979
Calm down, please.

47:59.012 --> 48:01.281
Fucking get me
out of here then.

48:01.315 --> 48:04.017
Looks like you're
fucked, mate.

48:04.051 --> 48:05.152
No, no, no.

48:05.185 --> 48:06.621
Matt, can you move?

48:06.654 --> 48:07.822
Shit down there.

48:08.857 --> 48:10.057
Can't move a soul.

48:10.090 --> 48:10.924
It's so far.

48:11.826 --> 48:13.460
Don't just stand there.

48:13.494 --> 48:14.461
Help us.

48:14.495 --> 48:15.830
Ah, fuck him.

48:15.864 --> 48:16.897
Come on, told you
it was this way.

48:16.930 --> 48:18.232
We can't just leave him.

48:18.265 --> 48:20.802
Don't even think about
leaving me down here.

48:20.835 --> 48:23.237
We'll find a ladder or
some steps or something.

48:23.270 --> 48:24.572
Oh for Christ.

48:25.640 --> 48:26.541
It's a trap.

48:26.574 --> 48:27.675
He's gonna come after me.

48:27.709 --> 48:28.777
Matt, we'll come back.

48:28.810 --> 48:29.811
I promise.

48:29.844 --> 48:31.345
Okay, we'll come back.

48:31.378 --> 48:33.147
Please, you can't
just leave me here.

48:45.192 --> 48:46.026
There you are.

48:47.629 --> 48:49.631
No matter where you
go, there you are.

48:49.664 --> 48:52.099
What the fuck
are you playing at?

48:52.132 --> 48:53.535
I thought the psycho got ya.

48:54.401 --> 48:55.369
I went back to find Jess.

48:55.402 --> 48:56.403
I felt bad.

48:56.437 --> 48:57.271
Why?

48:58.439 --> 48:59.574
She was my only friend,

48:59.607 --> 49:01.743
even if she's in
denial about that now.

49:01.776 --> 49:03.110
You had other friends.

49:04.512 --> 49:07.214
I had people who wanted
to by weed off of me.

49:07.247 --> 49:09.149
I had one friend.

49:09.183 --> 49:11.719
At least I thought
I had one friend.

49:15.422 --> 49:17.124
He killed Ben with
a for sale sign.

49:17.157 --> 49:18.258
Did you see that?

49:18.292 --> 49:19.894
Yeah, I saw it.

49:19.928 --> 49:21.896
Well don't you think
that's a bit weird?

49:21.930 --> 49:23.130
Like Ben was an estate agent

49:23.163 --> 49:24.799
and he was killed
by a for sale sign.

49:24.833 --> 49:25.633
Well it's not funny.

49:25.667 --> 49:27.000
He's dead.

49:27.034 --> 49:27.968
It was personal.

49:28.001 --> 49:29.236
It's deliberate.

49:29.269 --> 49:31.004
So what you're putting
a profile together now?

49:31.038 --> 49:32.907
Oh yeah, it's a
work in progress.

49:32.941 --> 49:35.844
Hey, did you really think it
was a prank back at the fort?

49:37.077 --> 49:38.378
I didn't know what to think.

49:38.412 --> 49:39.547
Right.

49:39.581 --> 49:40.481
What does that mean?

49:40.515 --> 49:41.315
Don't you believe me?

49:41.348 --> 49:42.550
Well come on, Rob.

49:42.584 --> 49:43.952
You left the group to
chase after a killer

49:43.984 --> 49:45.653
who murdered the guy
you used to hate.

49:45.687 --> 49:47.087
I didn't used to hate him.

49:47.988 --> 49:49.456
I mean, yes, you know.

49:49.490 --> 49:52.794
We had our differences,
but he was a good friend.

49:53.962 --> 49:56.029
He was there for me
when I needed him.

49:58.332 --> 50:00.267
If it wasn't for Aiden then,

50:00.300 --> 50:02.604
well I wouldn't have
made medical school

50:02.637 --> 50:03.771
and we wouldn't be here today.

50:03.805 --> 50:04.606
Why?

50:04.639 --> 50:05.472
What did he do?

50:08.108 --> 50:09.611
He took the rap for me once.

50:10.578 --> 50:12.747
And now I feel like I owe him.

50:15.315 --> 50:16.216
There.

50:16.250 --> 50:18.085
Add that to your case file.

50:18.118 --> 50:20.588
I'm just doing what
I know how to do.

50:20.622 --> 50:22.155
I wish I believe that we could

50:22.189 --> 50:24.057
just walk out of
here but I don't.

50:24.091 --> 50:26.426
Too much planning's
gone into this.

50:26.460 --> 50:27.795
If I could work out
what this guy wants,

50:27.829 --> 50:30.097
maybe I can convince
him to stop.

50:30.130 --> 50:31.566
Well to be honest,

50:31.599 --> 50:32.499
you're probably the only
one he'll listen to anyway.

50:32.534 --> 50:33.166
What's that supposed to mean?

50:33.200 --> 50:34.434
Come on, Jess.

50:34.468 --> 50:36.470
Don't you think it's a bit odd.

50:36.504 --> 50:37.539
Simon canceling so last minute.

50:37.572 --> 50:39.072
Don't be ridiculous.

50:39.106 --> 50:42.810
You know your fiance can be
a really evil shit sometimes.

50:42.844 --> 50:44.278
I suppose you didn't know
him back in school, did you?

50:44.311 --> 50:45.178
He's different now.

50:45.212 --> 50:46.514
He grew up.

50:46.548 --> 50:48.783
Look, just because
someone gets older,

50:48.816 --> 50:50.083
doesn't mean they grow up.

50:51.753 --> 50:53.387
Just through here.

50:58.158 --> 51:01.094
I can't see her.

51:01.128 --> 51:02.095
Can't see anyone.

51:03.263 --> 51:05.132
We should get back
to the others.

51:05.165 --> 51:07.401
That's a big fucking cross
on that hill over there.

51:09.469 --> 51:10.538
That's weird, innit it?

51:10.572 --> 51:12.040
You're the religious one.

51:12.072 --> 51:13.841
Is that a thing that happens?

51:13.875 --> 51:17.612
Did you ever see
"Two Fast Two Furious"?

51:17.645 --> 51:19.847
If I say yes, will
you come with me?

51:19.881 --> 51:22.182
I used to think it was
like a gay love story

51:23.383 --> 51:25.452
because when Tyrese
and Paul Walker meet

51:25.485 --> 51:26.821
in the movie for the first time,

51:26.854 --> 51:28.388
they're basically like fucking.

51:29.757 --> 51:31.091
And Paul Walker and Eva Mendes

51:31.124 --> 51:33.061
are constantly getting
cock blocked by Tyrese

51:33.093 --> 51:35.195
and then there's that
moment, you know,

51:35.228 --> 51:37.097
when Paul Walker
screams to Tyrese,

51:37.130 --> 51:39.399
I got something for
your ass, right.

51:39.433 --> 51:42.402
So, I've seen that movie
like what 100 times now

51:42.436 --> 51:45.506
and I think I finally get it.

51:45.540 --> 51:47.942
So Tyrese is pissed
at Paul Walker

51:47.976 --> 51:49.711
throughout the whole
movie for something bad

51:49.744 --> 51:51.244
that happened when
they were kids,

51:51.278 --> 51:53.648
but then there's this moment

51:53.681 --> 51:56.050
and it's one of the
most beautiful moments

51:56.084 --> 51:57.619
in cinematic history, right.

51:57.652 --> 52:01.488
They're on this boardwalk and
the sun is setting behind them

52:01.522 --> 52:04.391
and Tyrese finally admits
that everything bad

52:04.424 --> 52:07.327
that happened to them when
they were kids was all on him

52:08.495 --> 52:11.465
and he says he was
like riding solo

52:11.498 --> 52:13.101
and then Paul
Walker turns to him

52:13.133 --> 52:14.736
and gives him that
beautiful Paul Walker smile

52:14.769 --> 52:16.804
and he goes not anymore.

52:16.838 --> 52:17.805
Not anymore, bro.

52:17.839 --> 52:19.306
And I cry my eyes, right.

52:19.339 --> 52:21.843
I cry my eyes out every
single time I see it.

52:21.876 --> 52:24.012
Wait, wait.

52:24.045 --> 52:25.145
You made a wooden cross.

52:25.178 --> 52:26.380
You showed me.

52:26.413 --> 52:27.949
And I used to think
I cried my eyes out

52:27.982 --> 52:30.585
because I was high as fuck
watching those movies, right,

52:30.618 --> 52:32.020
but it's not that at all.

52:32.053 --> 52:32.854
Like I get it now.

52:32.887 --> 52:34.689
Like this is on us.

52:34.722 --> 52:36.189
Who hired you
to make the cross?

52:36.223 --> 52:39.493
When I got the name of who
requested the cross for me

52:39.527 --> 52:41.996
like I thought it was
just a coincidence.

52:42.030 --> 52:46.567
I thought you know maybe he
would've got over it by now.

52:46.601 --> 52:47.969
Who?

52:48.002 --> 52:49.904
He's what's bad that happened
to us when we were kids.

52:49.937 --> 52:51.739
He's the reason
everything's fucked.

52:53.107 --> 52:54.742
Sara, who hired you
to make the cross?

52:54.776 --> 52:57.310
Do you remember Carl Dixon?

52:58.178 --> 53:00.114
Fuck off.

53:00.148 --> 53:02.984
Carl Dixon on fire couldn't
pull off something like this.

53:03.918 --> 53:06.386
If you ask me, this is on Simon.

53:06.420 --> 53:08.221
He's the only one
that isn't here.

53:08.255 --> 53:10.357
He's got the money to pull
of something like this

53:10.390 --> 53:11.592
and escape the consequences.

53:11.626 --> 53:13.661
Plus he always was
a sadistic bastard.

53:13.695 --> 53:17.799
Carl Dixon ordered me to
make a big fucking cross

53:17.832 --> 53:20.635
and there is a big fucking
cross over there on that hill.

53:36.784 --> 53:37.952
Guys.

53:42.190 --> 53:45.225
I'd really like to get
out of here right now.

53:45.258 --> 53:46.426
Fuck.

54:01.642 --> 54:03.578
You know if someone
had told me back then

54:03.611 --> 54:05.278
that you would've
ended up as a fireman,

54:05.312 --> 54:07.048
I never would've believed it.

54:07.081 --> 54:08.816
No fucking way.

54:08.850 --> 54:10.051
If someone had
asked you back then,

54:10.084 --> 54:12.285
you wouldn't even
know who I was.

54:12.319 --> 54:13.154
I knew ya.

54:14.021 --> 54:15.723
Yeah, as a nerdy kid.

54:15.757 --> 54:17.825
Even you used to pick on me.

54:17.859 --> 54:19.093
No.

54:19.127 --> 54:20.728
You used to sit next
to me in art class.

54:20.762 --> 54:21.963
It's the only
thing I was good at

54:21.996 --> 54:25.032
and even fucked that off
'cause I'm colorblind.

54:25.066 --> 54:28.870
You used to help
me with the colors.

54:28.903 --> 54:30.138
That's me.

54:30.171 --> 54:32.140
Helping everybody
other than myself.

54:32.173 --> 54:33.340
We're nearly there.

54:33.373 --> 54:34.175
Come on.

55:10.978 --> 55:12.180
Shit.

55:12.213 --> 55:13.014
Shit.

55:13.047 --> 55:13.981
Ah, ah, ah.

55:14.982 --> 55:16.184
Shit.

55:16.217 --> 55:17.051
Ah, ah.

55:18.286 --> 55:19.787
Ah, ah.

55:19.821 --> 55:20.955
Ah.

55:20.988 --> 55:21.823
Ah.

55:25.126 --> 55:26.393
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

55:27.929 --> 55:28.996
Ow.

55:29.030 --> 55:29.964
Ah, ah, ah.

55:31.732 --> 55:33.333
Please stop fucking shooting me.

55:43.978 --> 55:44.779
Okay.

55:44.812 --> 55:45.780
Okay, I quit, I quit.

55:45.813 --> 55:46.981
You win.

55:48.616 --> 55:50.017
I'm not a copper.

55:51.819 --> 55:53.855
I failed the exams.

55:53.888 --> 55:54.856
I'm a prison guard.

55:56.389 --> 55:57.291
That's all I am.

55:57.325 --> 55:58.092
That's all I am, I'm sorry.

55:58.125 --> 55:59.327
That's what I am.

55:59.359 --> 56:00.528
I thought that what
this is all about.

56:00.561 --> 56:03.297
I'm sorry if that's
what you wanted.

56:17.345 --> 56:18.346
Ah.

56:35.863 --> 56:36.964
Fucking stop.

56:40.968 --> 56:41.869
Ah.

57:53.774 --> 57:55.076
Fuck.

57:55.109 --> 57:56.544
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

57:58.145 --> 58:00.915
Just get me out of here.

58:00.948 --> 58:01.782
Please.

58:04.652 --> 58:06.486
Please don't leave me.

58:08.155 --> 58:09.623
Ah.

58:09.657 --> 58:10.758
Ah.

58:35.449 --> 58:36.684
It's just in there.

58:42.356 --> 58:43.524
It's like him.

58:44.658 --> 58:46.127
That's Simon's phone, isn't it?

58:46.160 --> 58:47.128
Loads
of people use these.

58:47.161 --> 58:48.629
It's his phone.

58:48.662 --> 58:50.464
They're a multinational
pharmaceutical corporation.

58:50.498 --> 58:52.767
They sell millions of
products all over the world.

58:52.800 --> 58:54.301
Yeah, but no one would
have this much stock,

58:54.335 --> 58:56.604
not without a direct
connection to the supplier.

58:56.637 --> 58:58.005
So what?

58:58.039 --> 59:00.107
You think that my
fiance, your best friend,

59:00.141 --> 59:01.809
is trying to kill us?

59:01.842 --> 59:02.743
But he's the only
that isn't here.

59:02.777 --> 59:04.779
That's not what this means.

59:04.812 --> 59:06.447
Simon was supposed to be here.

59:07.314 --> 59:08.849
All of this if for him.

59:08.883 --> 59:09.650
What you mean?

59:09.683 --> 59:10.818
Think about it.

59:10.851 --> 59:11.852
Aiden worked from tissues.

59:11.886 --> 59:13.387
He had his eyes taken out.

59:13.421 --> 59:14.455
Ben was an estate agent.

59:14.488 --> 59:16.724
He was killed by
a for sale sign.

59:16.757 --> 59:18.626
Look, if these drugs
are here for a reason,

59:18.659 --> 59:20.394
then they're to
be used on Simon.

59:22.363 --> 59:24.965
The killer was gonna make
him OD on his own product.

59:26.400 --> 59:28.402
If you're right and these
murders were personalized,

59:28.436 --> 59:30.604
then it had to be
someone that we know,

59:30.638 --> 59:32.541
and the only person we
know who wasn't here

59:32.573 --> 59:34.141
when people started
dying was Simon.

59:34.175 --> 59:36.210
This is part of the plan.

59:36.243 --> 59:38.712
We were supposed to see this.

59:38.746 --> 59:41.682
Look, whoever's doing this
wants us in this room right now.

59:43.552 --> 59:45.052
Then we'll have to
change the script.

59:47.288 --> 59:51.225
We'll have to do something
that they're not gonna expect.

59:53.027 --> 59:55.796
Something to throw
'em off guard.

59:57.198 --> 59:58.866
What are you doing?

59:58.899 --> 1:00:00.569
If it is Simon out there,

1:00:01.735 --> 1:00:03.838
then he's not gonna
risk hurting ya.

1:00:03.871 --> 1:00:04.672
Rob.

1:00:08.709 --> 1:00:10.611
Jess.

1:00:11.979 --> 1:00:13.180
Shit.

1:00:24.158 --> 1:00:24.992
There it is.

1:00:26.293 --> 1:00:27.094
We made it.

1:00:27.128 --> 1:00:28.028
We made it.

1:00:28.062 --> 1:00:30.197
Nathan, I fucking love you.

1:00:31.365 --> 1:00:33.701
Maybe we should
get the phones.

1:00:33.734 --> 1:00:34.835
Yeah, let's do that.

1:00:38.372 --> 1:00:40.441
You know, today's
been a good day.

1:00:40.474 --> 1:00:41.742
I know that sounds wrong,

1:00:41.775 --> 1:00:43.978
but it's been the first
good day in a long time.

1:00:45.146 --> 1:00:46.347
Sorry, did
you say something?

1:00:47.815 --> 1:00:48.583
Nothing.

1:00:48.617 --> 1:00:49.416
Doesn't matter.

1:00:51.553 --> 1:00:52.353
Fuck.

1:00:54.355 --> 1:00:55.156
Fuck.

1:00:57.725 --> 1:01:02.696
Fuck.

1:01:05.466 --> 1:01:06.300
Fuck.

1:01:13.174 --> 1:01:14.643
Ugh.

1:01:14.675 --> 1:01:17.211
That is fucking disgusting.

1:01:17.244 --> 1:01:18.746
She's still alive.

1:01:23.684 --> 1:01:25.386
Are you the only ones left?

1:01:25.419 --> 1:01:26.555
I don't know.

1:01:26.588 --> 1:01:27.955
We got separated.

1:01:27.988 --> 1:01:29.023
What happened?

1:01:29.056 --> 1:01:31.492
When I saw the bodies, I ran.

1:01:31.526 --> 1:01:32.393
Went for help.

1:01:33.327 --> 1:01:34.395
He followed.

1:01:37.064 --> 1:01:40.034
Mate, that is fucked up.

1:01:40.067 --> 1:01:43.771
I can see what you had
for breakfast in there.

1:01:43.804 --> 1:01:45.873
Did you see who it was?

1:01:45.906 --> 1:01:47.708
Didn't see his face.

1:01:47.741 --> 1:01:48.543
Where are the phones?

1:01:48.577 --> 1:01:50.211
He took the phones.

1:01:50.244 --> 1:01:51.779
Slashed the tires on the bus.

1:01:52.980 --> 1:01:55.349
I still got the key
to the armory but.

1:01:56.483 --> 1:01:57.351
But what?

1:01:59.753 --> 1:02:01.556
He put it in there.

1:02:02.957 --> 1:02:04.559
What's in the armory?

1:02:04.593 --> 1:02:06.794
Body armor, some
smoke grenades.

1:02:06.827 --> 1:02:08.062
Basic paintball guns.

1:02:08.095 --> 1:02:09.564
You could do a bit of damage.

1:02:10.431 --> 1:02:11.432
It's not worth it.

1:02:12.333 --> 1:02:13.535
How far to nearest houses?

1:02:13.568 --> 1:02:15.135
Six
miles give or take.

1:02:15.169 --> 1:02:16.003
Fuck that.

1:02:16.937 --> 1:02:19.740
What are you doing?

1:02:19.773 --> 1:02:21.610
Getting our way out.

1:02:22.810 --> 1:02:23.777
Where is it?

1:02:26.514 --> 1:02:28.215
Oh wait, hang on.

1:02:31.852 --> 1:02:32.687
Wait.

1:02:33.688 --> 1:02:34.522
Okay.

1:02:36.757 --> 1:02:37.659
What?

1:03:38.052 --> 1:03:38.886
Tommy.

1:03:40.220 --> 1:03:42.156
Some of the names
have been crossed off.

1:03:42.189 --> 1:03:43.490
He's keeping track.

1:03:43.525 --> 1:03:44.325
Ben and Matt are dead then.

1:03:44.358 --> 1:03:45.660
Oh shit.

1:03:48.195 --> 1:03:49.296
Jess is still alive.

1:04:17.491 --> 1:04:18.425
Fuck you.

1:04:19.326 --> 1:04:20.829
That's what you fucking get.

1:04:24.365 --> 1:04:26.500
Oh shit, oh.

1:04:26.534 --> 1:04:27.569
Really?

1:04:30.705 --> 1:04:32.172
Simon.

1:04:32.206 --> 1:04:33.073
Simon.

1:04:33.107 --> 1:04:34.108
Simon, stop.

1:04:35.442 --> 1:04:36.745
No, we're mates.

1:04:36.778 --> 1:04:39.146
I was gonna be your
best man for fuck sake.

1:04:39.179 --> 1:04:41.882
Now whatever it is, yeah.

1:04:41.915 --> 1:04:44.251
We can talk about it, right?

1:04:45.252 --> 1:04:47.555
Simon, no, please.

1:04:47.589 --> 1:04:49.724
Simon, think about
what you're doing.

1:04:49.758 --> 1:04:50.592
Ah, fuck.

1:04:51.793 --> 1:04:52.861
Oh shit.

1:05:03.904 --> 1:05:04.739
Oh shit.

1:05:08.208 --> 1:05:09.910
Come on, me and you.

1:05:09.943 --> 1:05:10.978
Yeah.

1:05:11.011 --> 1:05:12.012
Fuck you.

1:05:15.249 --> 1:05:16.083
Come on.

1:05:16.950 --> 1:05:18.051
Come on then.

1:05:19.821 --> 1:05:20.755
No, no, no.

1:05:26.226 --> 1:05:28.863
I can't believe
you just did that.

1:05:28.897 --> 1:05:29.697
What?

1:05:29.731 --> 1:05:30.865
She was fucked anyway.

1:05:30.899 --> 1:05:31.800
Even more so now
you've rammed your hand

1:05:31.833 --> 1:05:33.668
in her guts just to get a key.

1:05:33.701 --> 1:05:35.068
Oh, fuck you.

1:05:35.102 --> 1:05:36.336
Look, just 'cause we
had a moment up there

1:05:36.370 --> 1:05:37.739
don't think you know me.

1:05:37.772 --> 1:05:38.972
I'm not a good person.

1:05:39.006 --> 1:05:40.974
I'm aware of that, but
it gets me what I want,

1:05:41.008 --> 1:05:42.710
and what I want right
now is for us to tulip,

1:05:42.744 --> 1:05:44.244
so we can take this fucker down

1:05:44.278 --> 1:05:45.613
'cause I've got a nail
appointment at five

1:05:45.647 --> 1:05:47.448
and I'm not missing
it for this shit.

1:06:15.042 --> 1:06:16.477
Should've signed it for them.

1:06:16.511 --> 1:06:17.311
Really?

1:06:20.380 --> 1:06:21.281
Wait.

1:06:21.315 --> 1:06:22.015
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:06:22.049 --> 1:06:22.951
Wait, wait.

1:06:28.355 --> 1:06:29.524
Don't you think
it's a bit weird

1:06:29.557 --> 1:06:30.991
that your photo was in there?

1:06:33.160 --> 1:06:35.229
Why is that weird?

1:06:35.262 --> 1:06:36.731
I am actually fucking
famous, you know.

1:06:36.764 --> 1:06:38.398
I just think it's
a massive coincidence

1:06:38.432 --> 1:06:41.769
that you get the key to the
armory and there's your photo.

1:06:41.803 --> 1:06:42.871
Just get to the fucking point.

1:06:42.904 --> 1:06:43.705
You're doing my head in.

1:06:43.738 --> 1:06:44.906
Okay.

1:06:44.939 --> 1:06:46.875
I think this guy knew
you'd get the key.

1:06:46.908 --> 1:06:48.475
I think this guy knew
out of all of us,

1:06:48.510 --> 1:06:49.677
you'd be the one
to stick your hand

1:06:49.711 --> 1:06:51.946
in a woman's guts to get a key.

1:06:51.980 --> 1:06:52.814
So?

1:06:54.214 --> 1:06:55.850
I think this guy
knows who we are.

1:07:00.320 --> 1:07:01.421
He knows who we are.

1:07:02.624 --> 1:07:04.491
If you compare this to
"Fast and Furious" movie

1:07:04.526 --> 1:07:05.727
then I'm gonna-

1:07:05.760 --> 1:07:06.995
- He knows what we
do for a living.

1:07:08.663 --> 1:07:09.496
All of us.

1:07:12.967 --> 1:07:14.268
All of this is on purpose.

1:07:15.737 --> 1:07:16.871
Well it doesn't look like
a fucking accident, does it?

1:07:16.905 --> 1:07:18.606
Oh, you know what I mean.

1:07:18.640 --> 1:07:20.542
Look it is Carl Dixon.

1:07:21.876 --> 1:07:22.710
It has to be.

1:07:26.113 --> 1:07:26.915
No.

1:07:30.284 --> 1:07:31.285
Want more time.

1:07:31.318 --> 1:07:32.554
No, no, no, no.

1:07:32.587 --> 1:07:34.121
Hey, no.

1:08:49.530 --> 1:08:50.497
Sara, wait.

1:08:50.531 --> 1:08:52.366
I heard someone in here.

1:08:52.399 --> 1:08:53.200
Tommy?

1:08:53.233 --> 1:08:55.003
What the fuck?

1:08:59.741 --> 1:09:01.075
Sara.

1:09:01.109 --> 1:09:02.209
Sara.

1:09:16.189 --> 1:09:17.025
Ow.

1:09:19.927 --> 1:09:20.728
Sorry mate.

1:09:20.762 --> 1:09:22.195
I thought you were him.

1:09:22.229 --> 1:09:23.230
I'm not sorry FYI.

1:09:24.331 --> 1:09:25.733
We have to go.

1:09:25.767 --> 1:09:27.101
I thought you were
looking for Sara.

1:09:27.135 --> 1:09:29.737
She ran when she saw
what happened to Rob.

1:09:29.771 --> 1:09:31.271
What happened to Rob?

1:09:31.304 --> 1:09:33.373
You don't wanna know, mate.

1:09:33.407 --> 1:09:34.374
Ben's dead, too.

1:09:35.643 --> 1:09:36.476
Where's Matt?

1:09:38.079 --> 1:09:38.980
Oh shit.

1:09:39.013 --> 1:09:40.247
We said we'd go back to him.

1:09:40.280 --> 1:09:41.448
Nah, fuck him.

1:09:41.481 --> 1:09:42.517
It's his own stupid
fault he fell in a hole.

1:09:42.550 --> 1:09:43.951
We need to go back for him.

1:09:43.985 --> 1:09:45.252
Are you fucking mental?

1:09:45.285 --> 1:09:48.056
He just said everyone's
dead except for us.

1:09:48.089 --> 1:09:49.389
I don't know Sara's dead.

1:09:49.423 --> 1:09:51.659
Well she's not here, is she?

1:09:51.693 --> 1:09:54.896
Look, we stick together
and we take this cunt down.

1:09:56.597 --> 1:09:58.166
What about Jess?

1:09:58.198 --> 1:09:59.834
Who gives a fuck?

1:09:59.867 --> 1:10:02.003
I think she killed Rob.

1:10:02.036 --> 1:10:04.271
Okay, now I give a fuck.

1:10:04.304 --> 1:10:05.840
I can't be sure
but she was in there

1:10:05.873 --> 1:10:07.008
with his blood dripping off her

1:10:07.041 --> 1:10:09.409
and she had this mental
look in her face.

1:10:10.545 --> 1:10:13.213
I never trusted that
bitch from prep school.

1:10:13.246 --> 1:10:15.215
What is she even
doing here anyway?

1:10:15.248 --> 1:10:16.349
No one liked her.

1:10:16.383 --> 1:10:18.152
Tommy, you're not helping me.

1:10:18.186 --> 1:10:20.588
The only way we can beat this
guy is if we stick together.

1:10:20.621 --> 1:10:21.522
We find Jess.

1:10:21.556 --> 1:10:22.790
If she's on our side, great.

1:10:22.824 --> 1:10:24.792
If she's not, we find
out what she knows.

1:10:24.826 --> 1:10:27.461
Either way, we need to find her.

1:10:27.494 --> 1:10:29.063
Take this and let's go.

1:10:42.176 --> 1:10:44.045
Sara, Sara, I'll get you down.

1:10:44.078 --> 1:10:46.647
Okay please.

1:10:46.681 --> 1:10:47.915
Oh God.

1:10:47.949 --> 1:10:48.750
He really went for
perfect accuracy.

1:10:48.783 --> 1:10:49.851
It's Carl Dixon.

1:10:49.884 --> 1:10:50.685
What?

1:10:50.718 --> 1:10:52.653
It's Carl Dixon.

1:10:52.687 --> 1:10:53.955
Okay, okay, okay.

1:10:57.525 --> 1:10:58.325
Here, here.

1:11:09.170 --> 1:11:10.470
Jess.

1:11:10.505 --> 1:11:12.140
Jess.

1:11:12.173 --> 1:11:13.841
I just have to know.

1:11:15.610 --> 1:11:17.111
We're riding solo.

1:11:20.014 --> 1:11:21.582
Not anymore, bro.

1:11:22.817 --> 1:11:23.918
Not anymore.

1:11:42.236 --> 1:11:43.370
He's here.

1:11:51.712 --> 1:11:53.014
I cannot see him.

1:11:53.047 --> 1:11:54.182
There.

1:11:57.618 --> 1:11:58.886
Aim for his weak spot.

1:11:58.920 --> 1:11:59.987
Hit his balls.

1:12:00.021 --> 1:12:01.255
How do you know it's a he?

1:12:01.289 --> 1:12:02.690
Get to the bottom
of this now, guys.

1:12:09.130 --> 1:12:10.031
Great.

1:12:10.064 --> 1:12:11.933
Now can't see a fucking thing.

1:12:11.966 --> 1:12:13.167
Neither can he.

1:12:13.201 --> 1:12:14.035
Ow.

1:12:15.136 --> 1:12:16.671
Fucking kills.

1:12:17.839 --> 1:12:20.308
This is fucking stupid.

1:12:20.340 --> 1:12:22.543
We're playing paintball
with a maniac.

1:12:22.577 --> 1:12:24.545
What do you think he's
gonna do if we hit him?

1:12:24.579 --> 1:12:26.047
Do you think he'll
throw his arms up

1:12:26.080 --> 1:12:27.315
in the air and say surrender?

1:12:27.347 --> 1:12:28.816
Except we're not
playing that role.

1:12:28.850 --> 1:12:29.951
What else can we do?

1:12:32.286 --> 1:12:34.322
Okay, you two keep firing.

1:12:34.354 --> 1:12:35.422
Cover me.

1:12:35.455 --> 1:12:36.691
I'll try and get behind him.

1:12:36.724 --> 1:12:39.459
When you hear me
shout now, charge.

1:12:39.492 --> 1:12:41.562
Finally a decent plan.

1:12:41.596 --> 1:12:42.429
I'm doing this.

1:12:44.665 --> 1:12:45.766
Go on then.

1:12:46.968 --> 1:12:48.536
I'm really fucking doing this.

1:12:48.569 --> 1:12:49.637
Fuck's sake, go on.

1:13:03.251 --> 1:13:04.218
Now.

1:13:12.093 --> 1:13:13.227
Stop fucking shooting.

1:13:14.695 --> 1:13:16.230
They're not firing
at us anymore.

1:13:17.298 --> 1:13:19.066
I don't hear
anything from Nathan.

1:13:21.235 --> 1:13:22.136
Fuck it.

1:13:38.986 --> 1:13:41.188
I don't see anyone.

1:13:41.222 --> 1:13:42.290
It's Nathan's guns.

1:13:43.624 --> 1:13:44.424
Fuck.

1:13:44.457 --> 1:13:45.293
There's blood.

1:13:46.761 --> 1:13:48.829
Maybe Nathan got him and
then the psycho legged it

1:13:48.863 --> 1:13:51.065
and then Nathan ran after him.

1:13:51.098 --> 1:13:52.199
I can't hear anyone.

1:13:53.167 --> 1:13:54.669
Can't see anything.

1:13:54.702 --> 1:13:55.870
This is fucked.

1:13:55.903 --> 1:13:57.772
Calm down, mate.

1:13:57.805 --> 1:13:58.706
It's fucked.

1:13:58.739 --> 1:14:00.440
This was supposed to be a laugh.

1:14:00.473 --> 1:14:02.442
I didn't sign up
for any of this.

1:14:02.475 --> 1:14:05.179
I could've been sitting
at home with my Xbox

1:14:05.212 --> 1:14:08.916
in my pants playing card
with a fucking protein bar

1:14:08.950 --> 1:14:10.584
and a decent cup of tea.

1:14:10.618 --> 1:14:13.087
I don't wanna be
dealing with it anymore.

1:14:13.120 --> 1:14:14.255
I'm done.

1:14:14.288 --> 1:14:15.089
Fuck Nathan.

1:14:15.122 --> 1:14:16.357
Fuck Matt.

1:14:16.390 --> 1:14:18.859
Fuck anyone else stupid
enough to get killed.

1:14:18.893 --> 1:14:20.328
I hope it's all a
prank, I really do,

1:14:20.361 --> 1:14:22.263
but if it's not, I'm sorry guys.

1:14:22.296 --> 1:14:23.731
I can't be fucked anymore.

1:14:23.764 --> 1:14:25.465
I'm going home.

1:14:25.498 --> 1:14:27.868
Are you literally having
a tantrum right now?

1:14:29.904 --> 1:14:31.038
There she is.

1:14:31.072 --> 1:14:31.872
Let's get her.

1:14:31.906 --> 1:14:32.907
Ooh, ooh.

1:14:46.921 --> 1:14:47.722
Where is she?

1:14:47.755 --> 1:14:48.889
She can't go anywhere.

1:14:48.923 --> 1:14:50.191
She's cornered.

1:14:50.224 --> 1:14:51.258
Should spread out.

1:14:51.292 --> 1:14:52.259
You take that side.

1:15:17.585 --> 1:15:19.420
Got you, you murdering cunt.

1:15:19.453 --> 1:15:20.888
And that's for grassing
me up all the time

1:15:20.921 --> 1:15:23.224
for smoking weed in
school, you fucking snake.

1:15:24.692 --> 1:15:25.893
Call off your mate.

1:15:25.926 --> 1:15:26.961
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1:15:26.994 --> 1:15:27.995
Oh come on, Jess.

1:15:28.029 --> 1:15:29.196
Have you seen yourself lately?

1:15:29.230 --> 1:15:30.498
You look like a
fucking used tampon.

1:15:30.531 --> 1:15:31.565
I saw what you did to Rob.

1:15:31.599 --> 1:15:32.666
It's Carl Dixon.

1:15:32.700 --> 1:15:33.501
Oh you, too.

1:15:33.534 --> 1:15:34.435
That's bullshit.

1:15:34.468 --> 1:15:35.436
Wait.

1:15:35.469 --> 1:15:37.071
Did you just say Carl Dixon?

1:15:37.104 --> 1:15:39.473
Sara thought the same
as well, but it can't be.

1:15:39.508 --> 1:15:41.108
You never said Sara said that.

1:15:41.142 --> 1:15:42.576
I think she knew.

1:15:42.610 --> 1:15:44.912
I think she figured it
out when all this started.

1:15:44.945 --> 1:15:46.414
Most of us are too self obsessed

1:15:46.447 --> 1:15:47.615
to remember what
happened to Carl,

1:15:47.648 --> 1:15:49.850
but Sara still
felt bad about it.

1:15:49.884 --> 1:15:51.419
She's been waiting for this.

1:15:51.452 --> 1:15:54.021
You never said it
was Carl fucking Dixon.

1:15:54.055 --> 1:15:55.256
Because it can't be him.

1:15:55.289 --> 1:15:56.991
It doesn't make any sense.

1:15:57.024 --> 1:15:59.026
It was bad enough that
the bullies, Aiden and Matt,

1:15:59.060 --> 1:16:01.062
pushed him around and
then the popular kids

1:16:01.095 --> 1:16:03.130
like you two treated
him like shit.

1:16:03.164 --> 1:16:05.466
And then to top it all
off the misfit kids.

1:16:05.499 --> 1:16:06.734
Even they picked on him

1:16:06.767 --> 1:16:08.169
because he was the only
one they could pick on.

1:16:08.202 --> 1:16:10.371
It was just school stuff.

1:16:10.404 --> 1:16:12.306
It wasn't serious.

1:16:12.339 --> 1:16:13.674
Oh come on.

1:16:13.707 --> 1:16:15.676
You're not seriously
considering this.

1:16:16.877 --> 1:16:18.946
There was a math
lesson where Carl

1:16:18.979 --> 1:16:21.782
ended up sitting next to
me for whatever reason

1:16:21.816 --> 1:16:23.518
and people were joking
around taking the piss

1:16:23.552 --> 1:16:25.920
saying he had a boner.

1:16:25.953 --> 1:16:27.621
When he got up to leave,

1:16:27.655 --> 1:16:29.790
I just meant to pull
his shorts down,

1:16:29.824 --> 1:16:31.892
but I got his underpants, too.

1:16:31.926 --> 1:16:34.295
And there it was
for everyone to see.

1:16:36.363 --> 1:16:38.899
We talked the piss out
of that every single day.

1:16:38.933 --> 1:16:40.468
We didn't give a fuck.

1:16:41.936 --> 1:16:43.838
We gave even less of a fuck
when people did even worse.

1:16:43.871 --> 1:16:45.339
Well Nathan beat the
shit out of him once

1:16:45.372 --> 1:16:48.109
just to prove that he could
beat the shit out of someone.

1:16:48.142 --> 1:16:49.477
And Aiden used to push
him around everyday.

1:16:49.511 --> 1:16:50.978
So did Rob.

1:16:51.011 --> 1:16:52.514
Ben used to steal his
paper around, wouldn't he?

1:16:52.547 --> 1:16:54.583
He was saving up the money
to buy his mom a present.

1:16:54.615 --> 1:16:56.951
She was in hospital
having a major operation.

1:16:56.984 --> 1:16:59.053
Sara spiked his
drink with LSD.

1:16:59.086 --> 1:17:01.523
He had a full on psychotic
episode at lunch time.

1:17:03.023 --> 1:17:04.725
We've all done shit
we weren't proud of.

1:17:04.758 --> 1:17:06.260
It was just school.

1:17:07.495 --> 1:17:08.929
It wasn't serious though.

1:17:08.963 --> 1:17:11.600
What you did, Tommy,
that was fucking gold.

1:17:12.567 --> 1:17:14.569
So what if it is Carl Dixon?

1:17:14.603 --> 1:17:16.237
Am I supposed to
let him murder me

1:17:16.270 --> 1:17:18.272
for some fucking
stupid prank at school?

1:17:18.305 --> 1:17:20.509
Maybe he just
wants an apology.

1:17:20.542 --> 1:17:21.976
That's your plan, is it?

1:17:22.009 --> 1:17:23.077
You're gonna say sorry?

1:17:23.110 --> 1:17:24.645
We started with 10 of us.

1:17:24.678 --> 1:17:25.846
There's now three.

1:17:25.880 --> 1:17:27.481
I say it's as good
a plan as any.

1:17:29.416 --> 1:17:30.251
Are you coming?

1:17:32.153 --> 1:17:33.888
If it's Carl
Dixon, I can't even.

1:17:35.055 --> 1:17:36.790
I still think about
what I did to him.

1:17:38.159 --> 1:17:40.194
Are you taking the piss?

1:17:40.227 --> 1:17:42.796
I've done some fucked
up shit in my time,

1:17:42.830 --> 1:17:45.833
but the way we treated
him was fucking awful

1:17:45.866 --> 1:17:48.903
and he just took the
abuse over and over again.

1:17:48.936 --> 1:17:50.671
Every shitty little
thing I did after that,

1:17:50.704 --> 1:17:53.307
I told myself it's okay
'cause you got away

1:17:53.340 --> 1:17:56.210
what you did to Carl Dixon
and now he's fucking here.

1:17:57.411 --> 1:17:59.847
What the fuck am I
gonna say to him?

1:17:59.880 --> 1:18:01.516
What are you gonna say to him?

1:18:14.563 --> 1:18:17.566
There's some kind of bond on
the other side of the river.

1:18:17.599 --> 1:18:20.535
I was hiding and I think
I saw him go in there.

1:18:20.569 --> 1:18:22.036
You really think
he'll back down?

1:18:22.069 --> 1:18:23.037
No.

1:18:23.070 --> 1:18:24.673
There's no harm in trying.

1:18:25.906 --> 1:18:28.209
Jessica fucking Bentley.

1:18:28.242 --> 1:18:30.144
Always the one with the answers.

1:18:30.177 --> 1:18:32.413
What the fuck happened
to you anyway?

1:18:32.446 --> 1:18:34.481
I burned out
halfway through Uni.

1:18:34.516 --> 1:18:37.251
Hadn't given myself a
break since I was 11.

1:18:37.284 --> 1:18:39.954
Pressure got to me
and I fell apart.

1:18:41.488 --> 1:18:43.525
Simon put me back together.

1:18:43.558 --> 1:18:45.192
Of course he did.

1:18:45.226 --> 1:18:47.529
Perfect Simon Hughes.

1:18:47.562 --> 1:18:49.430
Son of the headmaster.

1:18:49.463 --> 1:18:50.699
Perfect grades.

1:18:50.731 --> 1:18:52.499
Everyone's best mate.

1:18:53.901 --> 1:18:56.770
You know he was as fucked
up as the rest of us.

1:18:56.804 --> 1:18:58.607
He thought he was
so fucking superior.

1:18:58.640 --> 1:19:00.975
He used people as
science projects.

1:19:01.976 --> 1:19:03.344
There it is.

1:19:09.116 --> 1:19:11.752
Been trying to work it out
and I think I've got it now.

1:19:11.785 --> 1:19:13.454
That's what you are to him.

1:19:13.487 --> 1:19:15.889
You're his latest
little project.

1:19:15.923 --> 1:19:19.493
Lauren said what you
did to Carl was the worst.

1:19:19.527 --> 1:19:21.195
You know exactly what I did.

1:19:21.228 --> 1:19:22.597
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

1:19:22.631 --> 1:19:24.198
Are you serious?

1:19:24.231 --> 1:19:25.366
You really don't remember?

1:19:25.399 --> 1:19:27.501
Would I be asking
you if I did?

1:19:27.535 --> 1:19:28.737
I get it.

1:19:28.769 --> 1:19:30.304
You think you're safe.

1:19:30.337 --> 1:19:31.305
You think you're in the clear

1:19:31.338 --> 1:19:32.574
'cause you didn't fuck with him.

1:19:32.607 --> 1:19:34.743
I was the only one
that stood up for him.

1:19:34.775 --> 1:19:37.144
I wasn't even
supposed to be here.

1:19:37.177 --> 1:19:38.647
So what?

1:19:38.680 --> 1:19:40.715
You're gonna deliver me to
him so he'll let you go?

1:19:40.749 --> 1:19:42.082
Is that your genius plan?

1:19:42.116 --> 1:19:43.551
I'm not trying to
get you killed, Tommy.

1:19:43.585 --> 1:19:44.852
I'm trying to stop this.

1:19:46.453 --> 1:19:47.921
Tell me what you did.

1:19:50.224 --> 1:19:53.827
There was a rumor going
round that he liked ya.

1:19:53.861 --> 1:19:55.129
I mean really liked ya.

1:19:56.297 --> 1:19:59.099
So I stole his bag one
day and found the proof.

1:19:59.133 --> 1:20:02.803
He had a refill pad of handwritten
letters he never gave ya.

1:20:02.836 --> 1:20:04.639
So I set up a date.

1:20:04.673 --> 1:20:05.674
Tommy.

1:20:05.707 --> 1:20:06.874
You were playing hard to get.

1:20:06.907 --> 1:20:09.410
Worked out in the end though.

1:20:09.443 --> 1:20:11.145
He turned up expecting
a date with you

1:20:11.178 --> 1:20:12.580
and found you and me fucking

1:20:12.614 --> 1:20:14.381
in the waste ground
behind the playing field.

1:20:14.415 --> 1:20:15.482
You and me.

1:20:15.517 --> 1:20:16.917
That was to get to Carl.

1:20:18.720 --> 1:20:21.922
Think it was the only time
I ever did get to him really.

1:20:21.955 --> 1:20:24.158
He stopped coming to
school for a month.

1:20:24.191 --> 1:20:25.959
We all thought he'd left.

1:20:25.993 --> 1:20:28.429
Then he turned up like
nothing had happened.

1:20:28.462 --> 1:20:29.963
You're lying.

1:20:29.997 --> 1:20:33.167
You spent months leaving me
messages, sending me gifts.

1:20:33.200 --> 1:20:35.502
I never spoke to you
again after that night.

1:20:36.837 --> 1:20:39.073
I thought you were
just being a prick.

1:20:39.106 --> 1:20:40.441
It was school.

1:20:40.474 --> 1:20:42.577
I thought every
relationship was like that.

1:20:48.415 --> 1:20:49.216
Matt.

1:20:50.484 --> 1:20:51.786
Matt, are you still here?

1:20:54.455 --> 1:20:55.389
Don't worry, Matt.

1:20:55.422 --> 1:20:56.256
I'll get you out.

1:20:58.593 --> 1:20:59.460
Carl, is that you?

1:21:00.729 --> 1:21:02.831
I'm so sorry for
what we did to ya.

1:21:02.863 --> 1:21:04.231
I know it doesn't
make any difference

1:21:04.264 --> 1:21:05.767
but I'm genuinely fucking sorry.

1:21:05.800 --> 1:21:06.835
No.

1:21:06.867 --> 1:21:08.268
Wait.

1:21:08.302 --> 1:21:09.903
Not like this.

1:21:09.937 --> 1:21:11.372
Not like this.

1:21:30.759 --> 1:21:32.359
I'm really sorry.

1:21:42.503 --> 1:21:43.571
He saw us?

1:21:43.605 --> 1:21:45.072
He saw everything.

1:21:45.105 --> 1:21:46.674
Simon made sure of that.

1:21:47.941 --> 1:21:49.209
I haven't finished, Jess.

1:21:49.243 --> 1:21:50.077
Don't come after me.

1:21:50.110 --> 1:21:50.911
You're on your own.

1:21:50.944 --> 1:21:51.746
It was Simon's idea.

1:21:51.780 --> 1:21:52.747
The whole thing.

1:21:52.781 --> 1:21:53.947
That's what I'm saying.

1:21:53.981 --> 1:21:55.850
Carl was one of his projects.

1:21:55.884 --> 1:21:57.084
He bullied on anyone.

1:21:57.117 --> 1:21:58.318
Simon wasn't like that.

1:21:58.352 --> 1:21:59.654
Wasn't that obvious for Simon?

1:21:59.687 --> 1:22:01.155
He wasn't just shoving people

1:22:01.188 --> 1:22:02.456
in the playground type of bully.

1:22:02.489 --> 1:22:04.692
He liked controlling people.

1:22:04.726 --> 1:22:07.161
Manipulating situations.

1:22:07.194 --> 1:22:08.395
But you should know
what it's like.

1:22:08.429 --> 1:22:09.664
You're getting married to him.

1:22:09.697 --> 1:22:11.198
He would've never
had done that to me.

1:22:11.231 --> 1:22:12.667
You were nothing to him then.

1:22:12.700 --> 1:22:15.436
Makes me wonder did you
really burnout at Uni

1:22:15.469 --> 1:22:16.805
or did Simon push you there.

1:22:16.838 --> 1:22:18.038
Shut up.

1:22:18.071 --> 1:22:19.106
You'd have been
the exactly the type

1:22:19.139 --> 1:22:21.041
of experiment he'd go for.

1:22:21.074 --> 1:22:23.611
Jessica Bentley,
taking over the world

1:22:23.645 --> 1:22:26.480
one bullshit academic
achievement at a time.

1:22:26.514 --> 1:22:27.782
He'd have loved taking you down.

1:22:27.816 --> 1:22:29.216
I said shut up.

1:22:29.249 --> 1:22:30.652
Are you an actual alcoholic

1:22:30.685 --> 1:22:33.555
or did Simon put that
idea in your head?

1:22:33.588 --> 1:22:37.525
What I'd be asking myself is
why you're here and he's not?

1:22:37.559 --> 1:22:38.760
And maybe he is.

1:22:38.793 --> 1:22:40.027
Maybe it's both
of them out there.

1:22:40.060 --> 1:22:42.396
That would make more
sense, wouldn't it?

1:22:42.429 --> 1:22:45.165
Simon, Carl, we know
what you're up to.

1:22:45.199 --> 1:22:46.801
Shut the fuck up.

1:22:51.840 --> 1:22:53.006
Tommy, get up.

1:22:55.910 --> 1:22:57.879
I'll get help.

1:22:57.912 --> 1:22:59.547
I'll go get help.

1:23:50.364 --> 1:23:52.366
What are you gonna do?

1:23:54.002 --> 1:23:55.402
Oh, come on.

1:23:55.435 --> 1:23:56.871
Mate, I'm sorry.

1:24:03.477 --> 1:24:04.311
Tommy.

1:24:39.881 --> 1:24:40.882
Fuck you.

1:25:59.861 --> 1:26:00.662
No.

1:26:00.695 --> 1:26:01.596
No.

1:26:09.804 --> 1:26:10.838
Get it off.

1:26:10.872 --> 1:26:11.773
Get it off.

1:26:12.874 --> 1:26:14.474
I have to help him.

1:26:14.509 --> 1:26:15.409
Don't just stand there.

1:26:15.442 --> 1:26:16.376
Help me.

1:26:25.887 --> 1:26:26.788
No.

1:26:31.626 --> 1:26:32.426
No.

1:26:52.513 --> 1:26:53.480
Sorry.

1:26:53.514 --> 1:26:54.347
I'm sorry.

1:26:57.284 --> 1:26:59.453
I'm sorry for everything.
