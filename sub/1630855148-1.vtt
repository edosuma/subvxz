WEBVTT

01:31.221 --> 01:32.657
<i>...takes its way</i>

01:32.701 --> 01:34.659
<i>and goes the length</i>
<i>of the floor and...</i>

01:34.703 --> 01:37.314
Pan Am Terminal O' Hare Airport.

01:37.358 --> 01:38.881
You got it.

01:38.924 --> 01:41.579
- Could you turn that up?
-Alright.

01:41.623 --> 01:44.669
<i>Michael Jordan, 42 points,</i>

01:44.713 --> 01:47.803
<i>13 off 26,</i>
<i>from the field,</i>

01:47.846 --> 01:49.370
<i>with nine assist.</i>

01:49.413 --> 01:52.721
<i>Bulls defeat the Pistons,</i>
<i>108, 101 to...</i>

01:52.764 --> 01:54.114
Well, they're gonna do it
this year.

01:55.811 --> 01:57.508
That Michael Jordan can
do things

01:57.552 --> 01:59.989
I've never seen any other
player do in my life

02:00.032 --> 02:01.382
I mean, ever.

02:02.731 --> 02:05.734
Yeah, he's a-- a great player,

02:05.777 --> 02:09.564
but plenty of fellas came
before Mike that could do things

02:09.607 --> 02:11.305
you've never seen
in your life.

02:11.348 --> 02:13.437
- Like who?
- I'm talking 'bout...

02:13.481 --> 02:15.352
Connie Hawkins,

02:15.396 --> 02:18.964
Elgin Baylor,
Julius Erving,

02:19.008 --> 02:21.228
Dr. J in the Hawk.

02:21.271 --> 02:22.359
Yeah, I hear you.

02:22.403 --> 02:26.233
That style of play
goes way back.

02:26.276 --> 02:28.626
Like David Thompson,
Oscar Robinson way back,

02:28.670 --> 02:31.325
or we like,
talking where the hell back?

02:33.109 --> 02:35.372
You know your basketball.

02:35.416 --> 02:37.766
Sports writing is the life
for me.

02:37.809 --> 02:40.334
-Alright.
- What about you?

02:40.377 --> 02:42.640
What's your excuse?

02:42.684 --> 02:44.120
I know my game.

02:45.817 --> 02:47.950
Listen, pal,
we got a bit of a drive here,

02:47.993 --> 02:51.519
so, why don't you tell me
more about your game?

02:53.390 --> 02:57.046
A lot of people don't know,
how it went down.

03:05.010 --> 03:08.144
The highly anticipated rematch between the Globetrotters

03:08.188 --> 03:11.016
and the NBA champ
Minneapolis Lakers,

03:11.060 --> 03:13.193
is turning out to be
the game of the century, Marty.

03:13.236 --> 03:14.846
That's right, Howard.
And even though the Lakers

03:14.890 --> 03:16.413
had a commanding lead in the
first half,

03:16.457 --> 03:17.632
the trotters have come back

03:17.675 --> 03:19.547
in these exciting final minutes.

03:19.590 --> 03:22.463
Much of the damage has come
from one player in particular,

03:22.506 --> 03:24.639
and that's Sweetwater Clifton,

03:24.682 --> 03:27.207
who has had a spectacular game
tonight,

03:27.250 --> 03:30.514
battling against
the Laker giant, George Mikan.

03:31.776 --> 03:32.777
Come on. Straight coming!

03:32.821 --> 03:33.996
Sweets! Sweets!

03:34.039 --> 03:35.911
Yeah, do that!
Sweets, good job!

03:35.954 --> 03:37.260
I got mine right here.

03:37.304 --> 03:38.653
Oh, that's a foul!

03:38.696 --> 03:40.220
Ahan, aha!

03:41.569 --> 03:43.353
George Mikan gets blocked!

03:43.397 --> 03:45.007
I've never seen that before!

03:45.050 --> 03:47.749
I don't think anybody
has seen that before, Howard.

03:47.792 --> 03:48.793
Attack!

03:50.665 --> 03:52.754
And it's a tie game, folks!

03:52.797 --> 03:55.235
Sweets! Boom chick-a-boom!

03:55.278 --> 03:56.714
Now!

03:56.758 --> 03:58.063
-You got to move.
- Pass the ball, will you?

03:58.107 --> 04:00.283
- Move right, move right.
- Pass the ball, will you?

04:00.327 --> 04:02.111
Here come the Trotters.

04:02.154 --> 04:03.634
I got my man right here.

04:05.114 --> 04:06.637
Okay, okay.

04:06.681 --> 04:09.814
What in the world is going on
at mid court?

04:09.858 --> 04:11.990
Marcus Haynes is doing things with that basketball

04:12.034 --> 04:13.688
no one has done before!

04:17.257 --> 04:18.736
Here you go! Here you go!

04:23.480 --> 04:24.481
Yeah!

04:24.525 --> 04:25.787
You got it right there.

04:25.830 --> 04:26.875
Come on, Mike, get in!

04:26.918 --> 04:28.703
You're a tree!
Get in his way!

04:30.226 --> 04:32.097
Oh nice, nice, nice...

04:33.664 --> 04:35.927
Irish, did you see that?

04:35.971 --> 04:37.755
Have you ever seen anything
like that before?

04:37.799 --> 04:40.323
No, you haven't, because
it hasn't happened prior!

04:40.367 --> 04:42.107
My boys are the best,
you know that, right?

04:42.151 --> 04:44.284
Yeah, everybody knows it, Abe,
especially you.

04:46.373 --> 04:47.722
-I got my man right here.
-Come on, Joe.

04:47.765 --> 04:49.071
- Yes, I got him.
-You got him?

04:49.114 --> 04:50.812
- Hey, hey, hey! Yeah!
-We've got to...

04:50.855 --> 04:51.682
Oh, steal...

04:52.857 --> 04:54.337
Look at the size
of Sweetwater's hands,

04:54.381 --> 04:56.905
he makes the ball look like
a grapefruit.

04:56.948 --> 04:58.733
- Uh huh.
- He could play defense.

04:58.776 --> 05:00.691
By the way,
we all know that blocks

05:00.735 --> 05:04.086
and rebounds win games. Right?

05:04.129 --> 05:05.566
Yeah. Well, it's--

05:05.609 --> 05:07.785
It's like a circus, though.
It's Ringling brothers.

05:07.829 --> 05:09.918
Yeah, well, everyone's here to see that.

05:12.355 --> 05:14.052
I think there's a lot more
to this cager

05:14.096 --> 05:16.098
than just blocks
and rebounds.

05:16.141 --> 05:19.014
Alright. Hey, hey, hey!

05:22.844 --> 05:26.369
And the Globetrotters defeat the NBA champion,

05:26.413 --> 05:27.849
Minneapolis Lakers.

05:27.892 --> 05:31.243
Final score 49-45.

05:31.287 --> 05:32.419
Who are the champs? We're the champs!

05:32.462 --> 05:34.029
Who won this?
We're the champs!

05:34.072 --> 05:35.552
We're the champs!
We're the champs!

05:35.596 --> 05:37.119
We're the champs!
We're the champs!

05:38.425 --> 05:40.122
Way to go, guys!

05:40.165 --> 05:41.689
Man, what a way to bring it
to 'em!

05:41.732 --> 05:43.081
Now everybody knows

05:43.125 --> 05:44.996
who's the best
in the world?

05:45.040 --> 05:46.389
You're gonna have to phone
the missus, tell her

05:46.433 --> 05:47.869
you scored double digits
tonight.

05:50.698 --> 05:52.700
Looks like you had some fun
out there tonight.

05:52.743 --> 05:53.875
Always do.

05:53.918 --> 05:55.529
No, you made it look easy.

05:55.572 --> 05:56.921
Joe Lapchick.

05:56.965 --> 05:58.053
Nat Clifton.

05:58.096 --> 05:59.489
Some call me "Sweetwater".

05:59.533 --> 06:01.317
Hey, let's go, guys. Abe's waiting.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.275
And we don't wanna hear
his big mouth.

06:06.627 --> 06:09.064
I coach a team called
"The New York Knickerbockers".

06:10.631 --> 06:12.154
Dick McGuire is on your team?

06:12.197 --> 06:13.416
Yes, he is.

06:13.460 --> 06:14.548
He can shoot that ball.

06:14.591 --> 06:16.506
Yes, he can.

06:18.029 --> 06:20.510
Ain't no negros play
in your league.

06:20.554 --> 06:21.859
That ain't no secret.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.389
It's not gonna be like that
forever.

06:31.869 --> 06:33.915
I think that you can help
make the change.

06:35.133 --> 06:36.570
No, no, no.
No, no, I mean that.

06:38.136 --> 06:39.790
You can be the first.

06:45.143 --> 06:46.057
Great game tonight.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.583
I'll catch you later,
Sweetwater.

06:49.626 --> 06:51.976
Thanks, yeah.

06:52.020 --> 06:53.282
See you around, Mr. Lapchick.

06:53.325 --> 06:54.457
Please call me "Joe".

07:21.789 --> 07:23.791
Ow!

07:23.834 --> 07:25.836
Let's see. Go to mom.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.577
- But Dad...
- Go to Mom!

07:27.621 --> 07:29.057
Ow!

07:38.849 --> 07:40.242
A little bit of sugar

07:40.285 --> 07:42.418
makes the water taste
so much sweeter.

07:54.517 --> 07:55.518
Come here.

07:56.780 --> 07:57.912
Come here.

08:00.001 --> 08:01.655
From this day on,

08:01.698 --> 08:04.222
your name is not
Clifton Nathaniel.

08:04.266 --> 08:05.963
No more.

08:06.007 --> 08:08.662
It's Nathaniel Clifton,
you understand?

08:08.705 --> 08:10.533
Yes, Momma.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.317
Okay. Now, Nat Clifton.

08:14.058 --> 08:15.495
It's time to go.

08:15.538 --> 08:16.713
But Momma...

08:16.757 --> 08:18.236
Now you listen to your momma
now.

08:19.411 --> 08:21.457
Go on, and get on that horse
and buggy.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.721
Hey, your Daddy taking you
into the big city.

08:24.765 --> 08:27.245
Where you can have
a better life.

08:27.289 --> 08:30.727
He gonna take good care
of you.

08:30.771 --> 08:32.773
Yeah?

08:32.816 --> 08:34.209
But Momma,
I don't wanna leave.

08:34.252 --> 08:36.298
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

08:36.341 --> 08:40.258
Take these hands,
God gifted you with.

08:40.302 --> 08:42.391
You put them to good use.

08:43.914 --> 08:45.568
I always knew,

08:45.612 --> 08:48.005
you was born
with a higher purpose.

08:49.746 --> 08:52.444
You just got to believe.

08:52.488 --> 08:53.837
Yeah?

08:56.144 --> 08:57.406
I love you, baby.

08:57.449 --> 08:59.626
I love you, Mom.

08:59.669 --> 09:00.801
Come.

09:03.281 --> 09:04.369
Okay, now go.

09:04.413 --> 09:05.893
Go.

09:57.466 --> 09:58.641
Hey, good game, Sweets!

09:58.685 --> 09:59.773
Good game, Sweets!

10:11.175 --> 10:12.916
Hey Sweets...

10:14.701 --> 10:18.313
Did you see Mikan's face when you blocked his shot?

10:23.274 --> 10:24.928
Fellows, we might be sleeping
here tonight,

10:24.972 --> 10:27.627
but first,
it's pay time.

10:29.193 --> 10:30.586
Excellent job.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.849
Thank you so very much
for what you do.

10:32.893 --> 10:33.937
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

10:33.981 --> 10:35.243
Thank you.

10:35.286 --> 10:37.462
Looking great out there,
honestly and truly.

10:37.506 --> 10:38.812
-Thanks, Abe.
- Thank you.

10:40.117 --> 10:41.728
- There's Pops.
-Thanks, Abe.

10:41.771 --> 10:43.817
And last,
but certainly not least,

10:45.340 --> 10:46.384
thank you.

10:48.648 --> 10:49.605
Ahan.

10:50.780 --> 10:52.477
What?

10:52.521 --> 10:53.957
Oh, don't give me that look,
Sweetwater.

10:54.001 --> 10:55.872
You got something to say,
just say it to my face.

10:55.916 --> 10:57.352
I can take it,
spit it out.

10:57.395 --> 11:00.442
We beat them Lakers.

11:00.485 --> 11:01.704
The NBA champs.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.706
Yeah, we certainly did.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.187
It wasn't easy, honey.

11:06.230 --> 11:08.537
No. No, it wasn't.

11:08.580 --> 11:10.147
They're the... best.

11:10.191 --> 11:13.237
So, we didn't expect it
to be easy.

11:13.281 --> 11:14.586
And if I guess it
ain't my business

11:14.630 --> 11:16.763
how much they get paid?

11:16.806 --> 11:18.678
It's none of your beeswax.

11:18.721 --> 11:21.332
You're not hearing what
I'm saying, Abe.

11:23.247 --> 11:25.119
I would say everyone is hearing
what you're saying loud

11:25.162 --> 11:26.033
and clear.

11:27.556 --> 11:30.298
And on behalf of Sweetwater,

11:30.341 --> 11:32.779
I would like to further thank
each

11:32.822 --> 11:35.346
and everyone of you out
of my own.

11:36.870 --> 11:39.699
Take from tonight,
'cause you earned it.

11:40.787 --> 11:42.266
Sorry.

11:42.310 --> 11:44.225
- Alright.
- Don't miss it.

11:44.268 --> 11:45.705
Extra cabbage.

11:48.055 --> 11:50.318
Fellows I got big plans
more importantly,

11:50.361 --> 11:53.451
tonight's win allows us
to now travel the world

11:53.495 --> 11:55.366
with your talent.

11:55.410 --> 11:58.456
South America, Europe,
all the way to China.

11:58.500 --> 12:01.155
Places you've only dreamt about.

12:01.198 --> 12:03.635
Internationally known
Globetrotters.

12:03.679 --> 12:05.855
Bigger than Jesse Owens.

12:05.899 --> 12:06.987
- Right?
-Hmmm.

12:07.030 --> 12:08.684
-That's right.
-Joe Lewis.

12:09.946 --> 12:12.383
They're just gonna be talking
about you now.

12:12.427 --> 12:15.430
And I got new plays,
new routines you're gonna love.

12:15.473 --> 12:16.692
And one day,

12:17.998 --> 12:21.741
one day,
we're gonna be an NBA team.

12:29.661 --> 12:30.706
Get some rest.

12:31.881 --> 12:33.753
We're going to change the
world, Abe.

12:33.796 --> 12:34.797
Yeah, that's right.

12:37.844 --> 12:39.323
Thanks, brother.

12:44.894 --> 12:47.810
This is your opportunity to level the playing field.

12:47.854 --> 12:48.811
Give these boys a chance
and let's get them on the court!

12:49.986 --> 12:51.901
This is not a Negro league!

12:51.945 --> 12:54.251
- And never will be! Come on!
-I second the

12:54.295 --> 12:55.296
- gentleman's opinion.
- What are you talking about?!

12:55.339 --> 12:56.819
- Whoa, whoa, easy.
- Yes, thank you.

12:56.863 --> 12:58.560
Easy!

12:58.603 --> 13:01.215
What's with all the yelling?

13:01.258 --> 13:04.696
Now, I think we should proceed
with a...

13:04.740 --> 13:07.438
with an atmosphere
of respect, okay.

13:07.482 --> 13:08.613
And decorum.

13:10.050 --> 13:12.269
And as
for Mr. Walter Brown's inquiry

13:12.313 --> 13:16.186
regarding drafting Negro
players for the Celtics,

13:16.230 --> 13:18.232
the bylaws are clear.

13:18.275 --> 13:20.974
You are not limited
to whites only.

13:21.017 --> 13:23.019
It says players.

13:23.063 --> 13:24.586
Players.

13:24.629 --> 13:26.849
So, anyone of you wants
to draft a negro player,

13:26.893 --> 13:28.503
go be my guest.

13:28.546 --> 13:32.507
The Celtics are very interested
in drafting a negro player.

13:32.550 --> 13:33.682
- And...
- Out!

13:33.725 --> 13:34.988
Alright.

13:35.031 --> 13:37.251
I'd like to speak out
on behalf of my team

13:37.294 --> 13:38.861
and our interest in this league

13:38.905 --> 13:42.256
when I say it's unnecessary
to have all this razzle dazzle,

13:42.299 --> 13:43.300
hot dog,
and bull crap on our courts.

13:44.606 --> 13:46.826
And that's what
the negro players will do.

13:46.869 --> 13:49.611
Can I-- can I just say something
for a change here, okay?

13:49.654 --> 13:51.091
Just listen to me.

13:51.134 --> 13:52.788
I think I can personally
guarantee

13:52.832 --> 13:55.965
that no one in this room
loves basketball more than I do.

13:56.009 --> 13:57.662
Oh, come on, stop!

13:57.706 --> 13:59.534
Yes, that's right!
And this stuff you call,

13:59.577 --> 14:00.883
"razzle dazzle",

14:00.927 --> 14:02.798
well, I find it exciting,

14:02.842 --> 14:04.844
and quite honestly,
entertaining.

14:04.887 --> 14:07.281
Like...
like a dance!

14:07.324 --> 14:08.717
- Oh, like a dance?
- Yes, like a dance.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.284
Oh, it's-- it's a dance.

14:10.327 --> 14:11.676
- Yes, a dance!
- Okay. Thank you very much.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.765
They're supposed to put points
on the board,

14:13.809 --> 14:15.637
and paying customers
in the seat.

14:15.680 --> 14:19.206
Because, basketball after all
is a business.

14:19.249 --> 14:20.903
Or haven't you heard?

14:20.947 --> 14:22.339
Let's take a vote.

14:22.383 --> 14:25.865
Hm? A gentlemen's agreement
if you will.

14:25.908 --> 14:29.564
I move that the NBA is
for white players only.

14:29.607 --> 14:32.045
Ahh... I uh...

14:32.088 --> 14:34.699
I want to be on record
to saying,

14:34.743 --> 14:37.572
that it's a mistake
to go on record with that.

14:44.144 --> 14:45.275
I reiterate.

14:46.973 --> 14:49.410
I move that the NBA

14:49.453 --> 14:52.195
is for white players only.

14:52.239 --> 14:53.631
I second!

14:53.675 --> 14:55.938
Thank you.

14:55.982 --> 14:57.722
Okay, there's a motion
on the table.

14:57.766 --> 14:59.028
It says uh,

14:59.072 --> 15:01.857
the NBA wants to remain
an all white league.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.903
All those in favor,
please say aye.

15:03.946 --> 15:04.773
- Aye!
- Aye.

15:04.816 --> 15:05.730
Those opposed?

15:05.774 --> 15:07.210
Nay.

15:07.254 --> 15:08.472
You guys have it.

15:10.822 --> 15:11.867
Did you stand--
did you stand up?

15:11.911 --> 15:13.129
I tried. Of course, I did.

15:13.173 --> 15:15.218
-Did you?
- What do you think?

15:15.262 --> 15:17.525
- Of course, I did.
- Who-- who made the decision?

15:17.568 --> 15:19.962
- Podoloff?
- Him, board of governors,

15:20.006 --> 15:20.963
- team owner--
- Oh!

15:21.007 --> 15:22.617
It was kind of unanimous,
actually.

15:22.660 --> 15:25.272
The-- the NBA champs

15:25.315 --> 15:28.318
got their asses kicked
by an all-negro team. Okay!

15:28.362 --> 15:30.364
Well, if memory serves me well,
it was a pretty close game.

15:30.407 --> 15:32.409
Okay.

15:32.453 --> 15:36.152
If the Trotters had a franchise
in this league,

15:36.196 --> 15:37.980
there isn't a team
in the NBA

15:38.024 --> 15:39.025
that could beat them.

15:39.068 --> 15:40.243
I know.

15:42.028 --> 15:44.117
It's not my decision, okay?

15:46.684 --> 15:47.990
It is what it is, Joe.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.731
It doesn't have to be that way.

15:52.038 --> 15:53.213
But what do you wanna do?

15:55.650 --> 15:58.261
I'm starting to think
this is where I resign.

15:58.305 --> 15:59.828
Oh, that's smart.

15:59.871 --> 16:01.395
That's really smart.

16:01.438 --> 16:02.744
Now that we have
the ingredients

16:02.787 --> 16:04.441
for a championship team,
you wanna quit?

16:04.485 --> 16:06.487
Huh?

16:06.530 --> 16:09.359
These kids are counting on you
to take them to the finals.

16:09.403 --> 16:11.492
You wanna let them down?

16:11.535 --> 16:13.189
Go ahead, tell 'em. Go ahead.

16:13.233 --> 16:14.277
Alright, alright.

16:15.409 --> 16:16.584
- Yeah.
- Okay.

16:24.244 --> 16:26.289
Alright,
let's work our rebounds.

16:26.333 --> 16:27.464
Let's go, guys!

16:27.508 --> 16:29.684
Line it up.

16:39.650 --> 16:41.174
Babe!

16:41.217 --> 16:43.132
Goose!

16:45.482 --> 16:47.049
There it is.

16:49.138 --> 16:51.793
Yeah! I got him! I got him!

16:51.836 --> 16:53.055
Oh yeah, I got him, I got him.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.535
I got him! I got him!

16:54.578 --> 16:56.754
I got him! I got him!

16:56.798 --> 16:58.060
No, that's 2-2 on the whole.

16:58.104 --> 16:59.757
Whoa! What? Wait! What?

16:59.801 --> 17:00.932
Yeah, that's called "a foul".

17:00.976 --> 17:02.195
You called it on me?

17:02.238 --> 17:03.892
Yes, sir. You're 2-2.

17:03.935 --> 17:05.328
Alright, I'm sorry, Ref.

17:05.372 --> 17:06.199
- Alright. Give me the ball--
- Here you go, bud.

17:07.722 --> 17:08.897
Thank you, sir.

17:12.118 --> 17:13.728
What the hell kind of call
is that?

17:13.771 --> 17:15.469
- You don't want it that way?
- That's fine. It's fine.

17:16.470 --> 17:17.558
White ball.

17:19.168 --> 17:20.778
Alright. Come on, now.

17:20.822 --> 17:22.215
Hey, hey! Alright, alright.

17:22.258 --> 17:23.433
Hey, hey, hey.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.480
Keep going, keep going.

17:28.917 --> 17:30.179
Hey!

17:46.630 --> 17:48.502
Got my hat on.

18:18.184 --> 18:20.011
That damn clutch, again?

18:20.055 --> 18:22.318
No, that's the sound
of an empty tank.

18:22.362 --> 18:24.059
Forgot to fill up
in the city.

18:39.466 --> 18:40.684
So, I did my part tonight.

18:40.728 --> 18:41.729
So, who got bag duty,
'cause it ain't me.

18:41.772 --> 18:43.426
-Not me.
- Not it. Not it.

18:43.470 --> 18:45.036
-It ain't me.
- I think it's the person

18:45.080 --> 18:46.647
with the least amounts of points
tonight.

18:46.690 --> 18:48.083
Yeah, so...

18:48.127 --> 18:49.258
- Who is that?
-Ohhh...

18:50.390 --> 18:52.870
Ohhh!

18:52.914 --> 18:54.742
Alright, man. Alright, I'll-- I'll get the bags.

18:54.785 --> 18:55.786
That's right. Nice move.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.276
Step away, boy.

19:14.501 --> 19:16.981
You need to move away
from my lily-white pumps,

19:17.025 --> 19:18.113
nigger.

19:19.723 --> 19:21.986
We mean no harm, sir.

19:22.030 --> 19:24.641
All we need is some gas,
so, we can get on our way.

19:26.469 --> 19:28.341
You're a brave one talking back.

19:30.256 --> 19:31.387
You see this gun?

19:32.519 --> 19:33.824
It's loaded.

19:35.086 --> 19:37.001
I know how to use it.

19:37.045 --> 19:38.873
Let me tell you somethin'.

19:38.916 --> 19:40.570
I've used it before.

19:40.614 --> 19:43.834
Like I said,
we need some gas.

19:43.878 --> 19:45.271
The tank is dry as dust.

19:45.314 --> 19:48.926
Mm-hmm. And if I let you
pump some gas,

19:48.970 --> 19:50.885
how you gonna pay for it,
boy?

20:00.155 --> 20:01.504
Your money ain't no good here.

20:04.290 --> 20:07.597
Well, now who doesn't love
American cold hard cash, sir?

20:07.641 --> 20:09.730
Abe Saperstein at your service.

20:09.773 --> 20:11.688
Allow me to introduce

20:11.732 --> 20:14.169
the gentleman that you're
somewhat pointing that,

20:14.213 --> 20:15.736
powerful looking weapon
at...

20:15.779 --> 20:18.608
This is basketball legend!

20:18.652 --> 20:20.480
Nat Sweetwater Clifton.

20:20.523 --> 20:22.351
One of the stars
of the Globetrotters,

20:22.395 --> 20:25.006
the world renowned
Globetrotters.

20:25.049 --> 20:27.443
We just uh, need a couple of
gallons of your gas, sir.

20:27.487 --> 20:29.053
We'll be on our way.
In fact, I see

20:29.097 --> 20:31.099
the prices have doubled,
which we're happy to pay.

20:31.142 --> 20:34.102
Youse that negro basketball
team?

20:34.145 --> 20:35.321
You are a clever one, sir.

20:35.364 --> 20:37.540
Yes, we'se are
except myself, of course.

20:37.584 --> 20:38.976
I coach the team.

20:52.163 --> 20:53.687
Right uh...

20:53.730 --> 20:55.906
To Jen, my girlfriend,
on this side.

20:57.952 --> 21:00.041
Sure. Let me just see if there's
a pen on the bus, sir.

21:00.084 --> 21:03.218
Oh, well I've got this,
I do signs with.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.437
- There we are.
- Here you go.

21:04.480 --> 21:05.786
That'll work.

21:05.829 --> 21:07.135
Yes, indeed.

21:07.178 --> 21:09.050
Be happy to do that.

21:09.093 --> 21:10.660
That's uh...

21:10.704 --> 21:12.488
That's gonna have some value
on the open market right away,

21:12.532 --> 21:14.708
but if you hold on to it,

21:14.751 --> 21:17.624
like a piano or real estate,
or a painting,

21:17.667 --> 21:20.757
that will go up in value
over time.

21:20.801 --> 21:21.802
Yes, indeed.

21:21.845 --> 21:23.282
Y'all play a game today?

21:23.325 --> 21:26.154
We did! Yes, yes, a great game!

21:26.197 --> 21:27.416
And even better crowd!

21:27.460 --> 21:28.896
Weren't they something,
Sweetwater?

21:30.550 --> 21:33.248
Yup, some of the better
basketball fans we've seen.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.294
Good local folk you have here,
sir.

21:35.337 --> 21:37.774
Yeah, but terrific local team, too,

21:37.818 --> 21:39.733
if you had the pleasure of
seeing them play--

21:39.776 --> 21:41.778
I'll tell you what?
It'll be an honor of mine to

21:41.822 --> 21:42.997
provide you
with the finest seats

21:43.040 --> 21:44.085
in the house for yourself.

21:44.128 --> 21:45.391
The missus and the kids,
next time

21:45.434 --> 21:47.349
the Globetrotters pass through
your

21:47.393 --> 21:48.872
warm and inviting county.

21:50.047 --> 21:51.310
Who won that game today?

21:56.271 --> 21:59.187
Well, who do you think
won the game?

22:02.190 --> 22:03.887
Thank you for the autograph.

22:07.413 --> 22:08.849
That went well.

22:13.593 --> 22:14.724
Just get back in the bus.

23:11.346 --> 23:14.305
Uh, I'm sorry, we have
absolutely no rooms available.

23:15.524 --> 23:17.831
You have no rooms?

23:17.874 --> 23:19.920
This is our busiest
time of year.

23:19.963 --> 23:21.617
Yeah, I can see that.

23:23.489 --> 23:25.404
A lot of keys there behind you.

23:25.447 --> 23:27.971
You sure you don't wanna take
one more look

23:28.015 --> 23:30.409
to see if there are any rooms?

23:30.452 --> 23:33.324
Ah, it'd be a waste of time,
sir.

23:34.848 --> 23:38.199
I'll tell you what, you should
check out The Dunbar.

23:38.242 --> 23:39.679
They're right across town.

23:39.722 --> 23:41.420
I'm sure they'd be willing
to accommodate you.

23:43.117 --> 23:44.684
Across town, huh?

23:44.727 --> 23:46.903
Yeah.

23:46.947 --> 23:49.123
What about him?
Is he at the Dunbar, too?

23:49.166 --> 23:51.473
Oh no. He's here, sir.

23:51.517 --> 23:53.736
- What?
- Yeah, Mr. Bananas,

23:53.780 --> 23:55.521
he's-- he's staying with us.

23:55.564 --> 23:56.913
Yeah, he's just working
at the theatre

23:56.957 --> 23:58.393
- right across the street.
- Is that right?

23:58.437 --> 24:00.743
- Yeah.
- And he's got his own room here?

24:04.486 --> 24:05.792
Well, he...

24:05.835 --> 24:07.750
Him and his trainer.

24:07.794 --> 24:11.493
Sure. Somebody's got to order
the room service, right?

24:11.537 --> 24:13.452
Let me see if I understand this.

24:15.584 --> 24:18.152
Mr. Bananas,
this chimp is so talented,

24:18.195 --> 24:19.762
he's named
after the food he eats,

24:19.806 --> 24:21.329
whereas my fellas,

24:21.372 --> 24:24.201
who are the most talented
basketball players in the world,

24:24.245 --> 24:25.681
they've got no room here.

24:28.118 --> 24:31.426
Look uh, I don't make the
rules,

24:31.470 --> 24:32.819
okay?

24:32.862 --> 24:34.081
Times like this...

24:34.124 --> 24:35.038
Hmmm.
...wish the hell I did.

24:35.082 --> 24:36.779
Yeah, you don't make the rules.

24:36.823 --> 24:40.348
You just follow 'em,
like at Nuremberg.

24:40.391 --> 24:42.393
Does that ring a bell?

24:42.437 --> 24:43.482
Let's go, fellas.

24:44.700 --> 24:45.614
Wish you luck.

24:59.323 --> 25:01.456
That was very yummy, mom.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.327
I'm so glad you liked it,
sweetie.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.287
Dad, may I be excused?

25:13.729 --> 25:15.122
It's okay.

25:28.918 --> 25:31.355
Have never seen you
so distraught.

25:34.620 --> 25:35.795
It's the wall.

25:37.405 --> 25:39.015
What wall?

25:39.059 --> 25:40.800
Ugh.

25:40.843 --> 25:42.932
That Sweetwater Clifton
represents everything

25:42.976 --> 25:44.978
that I have been fighting for,
you know that.

25:45.021 --> 25:47.328
The guy is the future
of basketball,

25:47.371 --> 25:51.680
and there is this wall,
that the league built,

25:51.724 --> 25:53.769
and he won't be able
to break through it.

25:53.813 --> 25:55.771
Alright?

25:55.815 --> 25:59.079
By the time he does,
we'll be grandparents.

26:06.260 --> 26:07.478
Look at me.

26:09.350 --> 26:11.352
You are Joe Lapchick.

26:11.395 --> 26:13.572
Yeah.

26:13.615 --> 26:15.312
You don't have to break
through a wall.

26:17.140 --> 26:19.186
You just go get Sweetwater,

26:19.229 --> 26:21.797
and you climb over that wall
with him.

27:57.719 --> 27:59.329
I don't remember ordering
room service.

28:00.853 --> 28:01.854
I didn't mean to wake you.

28:01.897 --> 28:03.986
No, no, that's okay.

28:04.030 --> 28:05.292
I don't ever really sleep.

28:05.335 --> 28:07.642
Ah, well,
at least your team is awake.

28:07.686 --> 28:08.774
Right?

28:08.817 --> 28:10.819
We should take this up
to the Catskills.

28:10.863 --> 28:13.735
Saperstein and Lapchick,
some Lapshtick, right?

28:13.779 --> 28:15.868
- That's good.
- You know?

28:15.911 --> 28:17.826
To what do I owe the pleasure?

28:17.870 --> 28:19.523
Listen, I know you're not
fully conscious,

28:19.567 --> 28:21.830
but I would just love
to pitch you something.

28:21.874 --> 28:23.832
If you got a minute.

28:23.876 --> 28:26.443
Ah, bring the Globetrotters
back to the garden.

28:26.487 --> 28:27.967
I don't think so.

28:28.010 --> 28:29.882
Huh.
They'll sell it out again.

28:29.925 --> 28:31.710
No, we sold out,

28:31.753 --> 28:35.148
because it was the NBA champion
Lakers playing the Trotters,

28:35.191 --> 28:36.758
for an unofficial
world championship.

28:36.802 --> 28:38.151
It was a bragging rights, Joe.

28:38.194 --> 28:41.241
The fans did not come out
to see the Lakers.

28:41.284 --> 28:43.504
They paid their money
to see the Trotters,

28:43.547 --> 28:44.853
'cause
that's great entertainment.

28:44.897 --> 28:46.159
Other than
the Ringling brothers,

28:46.202 --> 28:48.335
we don't sell tickets,
you know that.

28:48.378 --> 28:49.771
Trotters sell out everywhere
they go.

28:49.815 --> 28:51.730
Yeah, in the boondocks, Joe.

28:51.773 --> 28:52.992
Tiny gyms.

28:53.035 --> 28:54.863
This is no comparison
to the garden.

28:58.258 --> 28:59.999
- This is Ned.
-<i>Hi Ned, it's Mickey.</i>

29:00.042 --> 29:01.696
Oh hey, Mickey,
what's going on?

29:01.740 --> 29:05.744
What if the Trotters played
an All-Star college team?

29:05.787 --> 29:07.615
That will put the butts
in the seats.

29:09.138 --> 29:10.531
Hold on, Mickey.

29:17.581 --> 29:19.279
I don't wanna talk
to that Saperstein guy.

29:19.322 --> 29:20.802
Already taken care of.

29:20.846 --> 29:21.803
Thanks, boss.

29:21.847 --> 29:23.109
Go ahead, Mickey.

29:51.441 --> 29:53.574
That's it, fellas.
Steal the rhythm.

29:53.617 --> 29:55.315
Boom chick-a-boom
chick-a-boom.

30:03.366 --> 30:05.325
Yes!

30:11.461 --> 30:12.985
-Oh yeah!
-Alright! Hit it.

30:13.028 --> 30:14.160
Show some magic.

30:21.907 --> 30:24.779
- Go ahead, Michael
-Go ahead, man!

30:24.823 --> 30:26.085
Now that's entertainment.

30:28.783 --> 30:31.003
Basketball as its finest.

30:38.706 --> 30:40.316
And skills.

30:40.360 --> 30:41.491
Skills.

30:44.059 --> 30:45.800
Ringling brothers.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.846
Yeah, it comes in handy though.

30:47.889 --> 30:50.631
Believe me, and by the way,
people love it.

30:50.674 --> 30:52.241
All that
and they can actually play.

30:53.460 --> 30:55.810
It's just a lot of fancy stuff.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.768
Yeah, but it sells, you know it does.

31:04.645 --> 31:05.907
No, no, no, no, no, no.

31:05.951 --> 31:07.822
Don't just finger roll it in,

31:07.866 --> 31:08.954
around the back
or something,

31:08.997 --> 31:10.042
and then stuff it.

31:10.085 --> 31:11.217
Razzle dazzle!

31:11.260 --> 31:12.261
Remember that!

31:12.305 --> 31:14.394
That's what the fans pay for.

31:14.437 --> 31:17.310
Don't start playing white on,
you're gonna put them to sleep.

31:17.353 --> 31:19.268
Five-minute break,
and I mean, five!

31:28.321 --> 31:31.237
Hey, you pay no mind to Sap.

31:32.934 --> 31:34.762
You go over there
and handle your business.

31:34.805 --> 31:35.981
You're gonna see,
he's a great kid.

31:37.373 --> 31:38.722
Just try not to scare him.

31:42.335 --> 31:44.032
I want you to meet Ned Irish.

31:44.076 --> 31:46.252
He owns the Knickerbockers,
and the Garden.

31:46.295 --> 31:48.428
No fooling, huh?

31:48.471 --> 31:50.125
Nice to meet you, Mr. Irish.

31:50.169 --> 31:51.953
Great to meet you too, Nat.

31:51.997 --> 31:53.389
Hey, let me see those hands.

31:55.826 --> 31:57.089
Oh, wow.

31:58.612 --> 32:00.135
Well, welcome back
to the Garden.

32:00.179 --> 32:02.398
Uh, yes sir, thank you.

32:02.442 --> 32:05.097
No, what's with this sir stuff?
Call me "Ned".

32:05.140 --> 32:06.533
Sorry.

32:06.576 --> 32:09.275
Just a habit left over
from my days in the army.

32:09.318 --> 32:11.103
You fought in the war?

32:11.146 --> 32:12.452
Yes sir, Joe.

32:14.802 --> 32:16.412
- Here, have a seat.
-Have a seat.

32:18.632 --> 32:20.590
Saperstein's a little tough
on you, huh?

32:22.027 --> 32:23.202
He knows what he wants.

32:23.245 --> 32:24.725
Yeah.

32:24.768 --> 32:26.640
He wants a show,
that's what he wants.

32:28.120 --> 32:29.860
Abe's got to win all the time.

32:29.904 --> 32:31.993
That's what we get paid to do.

32:32.037 --> 32:33.212
However, much that is.

32:33.255 --> 32:35.823
And I'm telling you,
it ain't much.

32:35.866 --> 32:40.349
So uh, you win all the time and you get paid for it?

32:40.393 --> 32:43.352
Sounds like a champagne problem to me.

32:43.396 --> 32:45.964
It ain't like that, Mr. Irish.

32:46.007 --> 32:50.142
You see, Abe sets up these
games with white players

32:50.185 --> 32:52.187
for us to win.

32:52.231 --> 32:54.276
What gets me is why set it up,

32:54.320 --> 32:56.148
when we're better
than all these white teams,

32:56.191 --> 32:57.714
that can beat 'em anyways.

32:58.933 --> 33:00.021
It's not like he's asking you

33:00.065 --> 33:01.980
to take a dive
in the 12th round.

33:03.503 --> 33:04.678
You see, Mr. Irish,

33:06.419 --> 33:08.508
we do things
with this basketball,

33:08.551 --> 33:10.771
don't even exist in your dreams.

33:12.773 --> 33:15.515
And I get people paying
for that.

33:15.558 --> 33:18.039
But I ain't interested
in being part of no circus.

33:18.083 --> 33:19.693
Okay, nap time's over.

33:19.736 --> 33:21.564
We got a big game tonight.

33:21.608 --> 33:23.001
A bunch of college idiots

33:23.044 --> 33:24.132
who can't wait
to get their butts kicked.

33:24.176 --> 33:26.091
Let's go. Sweets!

33:47.155 --> 33:48.374
Yeah!

33:48.417 --> 33:49.418
Sweetwater!

33:51.638 --> 33:53.031
Okay, Caleb and Andrew,

33:53.074 --> 33:56.121
I want you guys out there
double-teaming Sweetwater.

33:56.164 --> 33:57.905
But every time we step
on this court,

33:57.948 --> 33:59.689
- it means something.
- Right.

33:59.733 --> 34:01.256
So, let's make these
last seconds count.

34:01.300 --> 34:02.518
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey.

34:03.824 --> 34:05.391
I got something up my sleeve.

34:10.700 --> 34:13.660
Wa-- wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

34:13.703 --> 34:14.835
Wait.

34:21.276 --> 34:23.409
Hehe. Thank you!

34:27.152 --> 34:28.501
It worked, man.

34:28.544 --> 34:29.806
Alright, man,
I'll tell you

34:29.850 --> 34:32.244
after a win like that,
I'm going out tonight.

34:32.287 --> 34:33.897
Looking like Superman
with them shoulder pads on.

34:35.682 --> 34:37.162
Where we going tonight?

34:37.205 --> 34:39.338
If you want to meet the fellows,
you just need to tell me.

34:40.513 --> 34:43.124
Later.

34:43.168 --> 34:45.083
Okay fellas, grab your stuff.
Let's get on the bus.

34:45.126 --> 34:46.910
- Here we go!
-Irish.

34:46.954 --> 34:48.086
Thank you, thank you, thank
you, thank you.

34:49.391 --> 34:50.131
Good to see you there, Mr. Irish.

34:50.175 --> 34:51.393
Great game, great game.

34:51.437 --> 34:52.438
You make sure there's money out there...

34:54.440 --> 34:55.571
It really is your lucky day.

34:55.615 --> 34:57.138
How lucky am I?

34:57.182 --> 34:59.053
About 2 grand lucky.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.403
You're not so bad after all,
Irish.

35:01.447 --> 35:03.101
Wish I could say the same
about you, Abe.

35:04.319 --> 35:05.712
What about the other team?

35:05.755 --> 35:07.148
Took care of them
from my end.

35:07.192 --> 35:08.280
Like we agreed.

35:08.323 --> 35:10.282
- 100 shekels each?
-100 a man.

35:10.325 --> 35:12.110
- Paid in full.
- Alright, I gotta skedaddle.

35:12.153 --> 35:14.286
We got another show
upstate in the boonies.

35:14.329 --> 35:15.896
Looks like you're working
too hard.

35:15.939 --> 35:19.117
Oh, if I had your money,
I'd give mine away.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.248
Huh.

35:51.932 --> 35:54.108
Special place, isn't it?

35:54.152 --> 35:55.153
Oh yeah.

35:56.371 --> 35:58.112
She is beautiful.

35:58.156 --> 35:59.896
Yeah.

35:59.940 --> 36:02.203
I won a couple of championships
here with St John's.

36:02.247 --> 36:04.118
- Oh, I know.
- Yeah.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.163
Yeah.

36:07.774 --> 36:09.167
Let's see what you're made of.

36:12.257 --> 36:14.433
Try to get one past me.

36:14.476 --> 36:15.912
You'll need to take that coat
off though.

36:17.479 --> 36:18.915
- You wanna play me?
- Yes, sir.

36:18.959 --> 36:21.875
Oh, come on. You serious?

36:21.918 --> 36:23.224
Yeah,
I couldn't be more serious.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.184
Alright.

36:28.011 --> 36:28.925
Come on,
I know what you're thinking.

36:28.969 --> 36:30.013
I know what you're thinking.

36:30.057 --> 36:32.538
That you're taller,
and stronger,

36:32.581 --> 36:34.192
and a better athlete.

36:34.235 --> 36:35.628
Better looking.

36:35.671 --> 36:38.500
Longer arm reach,
bigger hands.

36:38.544 --> 36:40.720
But you...

36:40.763 --> 36:42.548
You cannot get one pass me.

36:42.591 --> 36:43.636
Alright.

36:46.291 --> 36:48.380
- Hold on, Joe. Hold on.
- Oh, I think you're--

36:48.423 --> 36:50.251
- wait a minute.
- Now hold on, Joe.

36:50.295 --> 36:51.600
- That was a foul, Joe.
- No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no,

36:51.644 --> 36:52.732
- you're thinking it was?
- It's-- it's a foul, Joe.

36:52.775 --> 36:53.907
No, no, it was--
There was not a foul.

36:53.950 --> 36:56.649
- You did forget something.
- Okay. Okay.

36:56.692 --> 36:58.172
Okay.

36:58.216 --> 37:00.435
- Oh, now the coat comes off.
- Alright.

37:00.479 --> 37:01.349
Give me the ball.

37:02.481 --> 37:04.396
Okay.

37:04.439 --> 37:06.093
Too much Godzilla,
come on, Joe.

37:06.136 --> 37:07.660
- Oh!
- Come on, Joe.

37:09.444 --> 37:11.054
No, no, no.

37:11.098 --> 37:12.926
That uh...

37:12.969 --> 37:14.667
It happens every once
in a while.

37:14.710 --> 37:15.624
- Come on, Coach.
- You know what?

37:15.668 --> 37:17.322
I wasn't warmed up kid.

37:17.365 --> 37:18.410
I warm up,
that doesn't happen.

37:19.672 --> 37:21.587
Okay. You're gonna walk away?

37:21.630 --> 37:22.588
- That's it.
-It's okay.

37:22.631 --> 37:24.459
You're scared, I get it.

37:24.503 --> 37:26.940
Oh, no, I think, you just need a
little more practice.

37:26.983 --> 37:28.115
Joe, Joe, Joe.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.447
Old clutch finally gave out.

37:57.275 --> 37:58.798
I'll get a mechanic
by the morning.

37:58.841 --> 38:00.321
But we ain't going anywhere
tonight.

38:03.759 --> 38:04.760
Night.

38:07.937 --> 38:09.243
What took you so long, Sweets?

38:09.287 --> 38:10.853
A lot of miles you
and me, huh?

38:12.246 --> 38:13.856
I'm going for a walk...

38:13.900 --> 38:15.684
I mean, I can't really
complain, can I?

38:18.905 --> 38:20.210
Where the hell are you going?

38:20.254 --> 38:22.169
Oh, mind your business, Abe.

38:31.918 --> 38:33.963
Kitchen's closed.

38:34.007 --> 38:35.313
You need to leave.

38:38.228 --> 38:40.753
I said, you need to leave.

38:42.015 --> 38:43.495
It's okay.

38:43.538 --> 38:44.496
He's with me.

38:46.889 --> 38:48.587
Okay, come on.

38:58.379 --> 38:59.598
Good evening, sir. What can I get for you?

38:59.641 --> 39:02.644
Yeah, uh, another Bourbon
for me

39:02.688 --> 39:05.168
and uh,
make it a double for my friend.

39:05.212 --> 39:07.475
A glass of water
and two scoops of sugar, please.

39:07.519 --> 39:13.307
<i>♪ With all your faults</i>
<i>I love you still ♪</i>

39:15.135 --> 39:17.224
<i>♪ It had to be you </i>

39:17.267 --> 39:19.400
<i>♪ Wonderful you </i>

39:19.444 --> 39:24.274
<i>♪ Had to be you... </i>

39:28.931 --> 39:30.324
She ain't bad.

39:30.368 --> 39:32.935
The way she bend them notes,
catches you off guard,

39:32.979 --> 39:34.241
you know.

39:34.284 --> 39:35.677
Like shooting the ball
when you ain't thinking.

39:35.721 --> 39:37.418
Hm. And how you play.

39:37.462 --> 39:39.681
Yeah, man, yeah.

39:39.725 --> 39:41.596
Like jazz.

39:41.640 --> 39:42.902
Feeling.

39:42.945 --> 39:44.207
I'll have to pay more attention
next time.

39:45.383 --> 39:47.820
You know, uh,
Lapchick's preaches

39:47.863 --> 39:49.169
that you're the future
of basketball.

39:51.258 --> 39:53.521
Oh, right now, my future is
on a broken down bus

39:53.565 --> 39:55.610
in a alley.

39:55.654 --> 39:57.786
You know, we could change that.

39:57.830 --> 39:58.918
I know if you pay me right,

39:58.961 --> 40:00.485
maybe we could win
a championship.

40:01.703 --> 40:03.052
I'd pay anything
to see the look

40:03.096 --> 40:04.706
on Abe's face, if you left.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.103
Nothing more tempting
than freedom.

40:10.146 --> 40:11.147
Well, let's see now.

40:16.979 --> 40:18.285
How's that?

40:18.328 --> 40:20.113
Thanks for the soda pop.

40:20.156 --> 40:21.375
It's the least I could do.

40:22.724 --> 40:23.856
Enjoy your sweet water,

just now.

41:06.855 --> 41:08.291

41:36.145 --> 41:37.756
Oh, I love the Blues,

44:26.489 --> 44:28.187
singing the blues
for you tonight,

44:28.230 --> 44:29.492
Miss Jeanne Staples.

44:35.629 --> 44:37.152
You guys are jumping hot
tonight.

44:37.196 --> 44:39.633
Oh well, thank you,
but look who's talking?

44:39.677 --> 44:42.375
Yeah, Jeanne gigs over
at the 50 Second Club.

44:42.418 --> 44:43.942
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

44:43.985 --> 44:45.813
Alright, well next time,
we're in town,

44:45.857 --> 44:47.423
we got to have you
come sing with us again.

44:47.467 --> 44:48.511
Oh, I'd like that very much.

44:48.555 --> 44:49.817
Thank you, sir.

44:49.861 --> 44:51.166
It's just T-Bone.

44:54.126 --> 44:55.388
Alright.

45:24.504 --> 45:27.115
I can't with how many times I've had to fix this damn thing.

45:28.551 --> 45:31.032
You know-- hey Sweets,
we're almost done here.

45:31.076 --> 45:32.773
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:34.340 --> 45:35.863
Oh, I'm gonna go wash up.

45:35.907 --> 45:36.777
Alright, hurry up.

45:36.821 --> 45:38.866
We gotta get upstate.

45:38.910 --> 45:40.302
How much is this gonna be?

45:40.346 --> 45:42.740
$5? $10? You know what?

45:42.783 --> 45:44.306
Don't answer that.
It's a trick question.

46:01.846 --> 46:02.977
Alright, half court offence.

46:03.021 --> 46:04.718
Here we go, boys. Here we go.

46:04.762 --> 46:06.285
Here we go, okay.

46:06.328 --> 46:07.982
McGuire, what are you doing?

46:08.026 --> 46:09.157
Okay, keep it moving.

46:09.201 --> 46:11.246
Extra pass. Extra pass.

46:12.770 --> 46:14.510
What are you--
Hold on a second.

46:14.554 --> 46:16.556
If we keep coming
without the ball,

46:16.599 --> 46:18.688
let's go again, alright.
Give and go.

46:18.732 --> 46:20.821
As soon as you give it,
just make that cut.

46:20.865 --> 46:22.257
Make-- Don't ever stop.

46:22.301 --> 46:23.476
-Okay.
-This doesn't stop.

46:23.519 --> 46:24.607
Let's go, let's go.

46:24.651 --> 46:26.000
Movement.

46:26.044 --> 46:28.481
Make that cut. There we go.

46:28.524 --> 46:30.222
Okay. Perfect.

46:30.265 --> 46:31.310
Alright?

46:31.353 --> 46:32.572
That's how it's done.

46:32.615 --> 46:34.879
There's more options
from the post.

46:34.922 --> 46:36.271
- Who's that?
- Oh, look at that.

46:37.707 --> 46:39.144
Good to see you, Joe.

46:40.362 --> 46:42.408
You too, Sweetwater.

46:42.451 --> 46:43.452
Give me the ball.

46:45.890 --> 46:47.935
Alright, fellas, same play.

46:47.979 --> 46:49.807
Set it up.

46:49.850 --> 46:52.635
Max, Vandeweghe,
criss cross right there.

46:52.679 --> 46:53.898
McGuire, cut now!

46:55.682 --> 46:56.988
Hey. Yeah!

46:57.858 --> 46:59.077
Nice layout!

46:59.120 --> 47:00.165
Nice shot.

47:00.208 --> 47:02.732
Not bad for a bunch
of white guys.

47:02.776 --> 47:03.951
Now, that's a well-coached team.

47:03.995 --> 47:04.430
Hmm.

47:06.084 --> 47:07.433
That's a well. Thanks for this one, fellas.

47:07.476 --> 47:09.478
- Absolutely.
- See you around, Joe.

47:12.351 --> 47:14.048
Hey Joe, can I have a word, please?

47:14.092 --> 47:15.397
Alright, guys, come on.

47:15.441 --> 47:16.703
Give me a second, guys.

47:19.097 --> 47:22.143
Um, what do you think you're doing?

47:22.187 --> 47:23.884
What are you talking about?

47:23.928 --> 47:26.147
You do realize letting him play
is a violation of league policy?

47:26.191 --> 47:28.367
No. League policy says that you
can't

47:28.410 --> 47:30.673
draft a player of color.

47:30.717 --> 47:31.761
It doesn't say that you
can't practice.

47:31.805 --> 47:33.285
Oh, come on, Joe.

47:35.417 --> 47:36.984
No one moves like Sweetwater.

47:37.028 --> 47:38.203
No one, no one posts up
like him.

47:38.246 --> 47:39.421
No one can pass.

47:39.465 --> 47:41.249
Maybe Cousy, but he's not 6'8".

47:41.293 --> 47:43.773
Sweetwater is an older player.

47:43.817 --> 47:46.080
And more importantly,
you're forgetting that he's a...

47:46.124 --> 47:47.168
A negro?

47:49.954 --> 47:51.129
We could win a title
with that negro.

47:52.304 --> 47:54.436
He'd make a great Knickerbocker.

47:54.480 --> 47:55.698
That's just my two cents.

47:58.049 --> 47:59.224
Thank you.

48:03.968 --> 48:05.578
Alright, guys.

48:05.621 --> 48:06.753
Let's hit the shower.

48:06.796 --> 48:08.059
Good work today.

48:08.102 --> 48:09.234
Let's go, fellows.

48:18.460 --> 48:20.941
Look, I know that the league

48:20.985 --> 48:23.726
and the owners are gonna fight
you on this to no end--

48:23.770 --> 48:25.772
- Huh.
- But I want this.

48:25.815 --> 48:27.687
I want it bad, Ned. Alright?

48:27.730 --> 48:30.951
You saw it was sellout crowd,
right?

48:30.995 --> 48:33.171
The fans are gonna
eat it up.

48:33.214 --> 48:34.868
Yeah, well, have you ever
thought of the fact

48:34.912 --> 48:36.609
that maybe Sweetwater's best
years might be behind him?

48:36.652 --> 48:37.653
Oh, come on, that's--

48:37.697 --> 48:39.307
You know that's not true.

48:39.351 --> 48:41.788
We all know that's not true.

48:41.831 --> 48:45.444
Look, Sweetwater knows this game
better than anyone,

48:45.487 --> 48:47.446
young or old.

48:47.489 --> 48:49.622
You know how long,

48:49.665 --> 48:53.582
and how hard I have fought
to break down barriers?

48:54.844 --> 48:56.237
I will fight for this.

48:57.369 --> 48:58.979
I wanna fight with you.

49:02.809 --> 49:04.506
It's not an easy mountain
to climb, Joe.

49:04.550 --> 49:05.855
Yeah, we'll climb it together.

49:08.597 --> 49:09.816
Could get ugly.

49:09.859 --> 49:10.948
I was born ugly.

49:14.473 --> 49:15.909
- Thanks very much.
-You're welcome.

49:15.953 --> 49:17.432
- Take care of yourself.
-Thank you.

49:20.522 --> 49:22.655
Hey, Saperstein.

49:22.698 --> 49:24.135
Great game yesterday.

49:24.178 --> 49:26.006
About that,

49:26.050 --> 49:27.312
listen I'm glad I saw you.

49:27.355 --> 49:29.140
I wanted to thank you
for the accommodations

49:29.183 --> 49:32.317
your urine-soaked alleyway
has been very nice to me.

49:32.360 --> 49:34.667
You're welcome, anytime.

49:34.710 --> 49:38.932
So uh,
I think this belongs to you.

49:38.976 --> 49:41.456
What?
We settled up last night.

49:41.500 --> 49:43.023
New day new deal.

49:43.067 --> 49:44.720
Yeah, but what is it?

49:44.764 --> 49:46.722
It's about 5,000 in cash.

49:46.766 --> 49:47.810
What?

49:47.854 --> 49:48.811
Why?

49:48.855 --> 49:50.552
Why?

49:50.596 --> 49:52.946
Well, it's not a raise.

49:52.990 --> 49:54.600
I want
to buy Sweetwater's contract.

49:57.995 --> 49:59.866
I like you, Irish.

49:59.909 --> 50:00.823
You're funny.

50:02.477 --> 50:04.088
Did you talk to Sweets
about this?

50:04.131 --> 50:06.438
- Not really, no.
- No, didn't think so.

50:06.481 --> 50:09.049
I should keep this cash
to pay for the insult.

50:09.093 --> 50:10.659
- It's not happening.
- Why?

50:10.703 --> 50:13.227
I thought you'd be interested
in getting rid of a headache.

50:13.271 --> 50:15.012
Yeah, it's quite the headache
I get

50:15.055 --> 50:17.014
from counting all the money
he makes me.

50:17.057 --> 50:18.145
Forget it.

50:19.494 --> 50:20.974
Let me ask you something.
You don't really think

50:21.018 --> 50:22.671
Sweetwater's gonna play
in the NBA?

50:22.715 --> 50:24.238
Lapchick, I understand,
he wants to move the

50:24.282 --> 50:25.935
color line and I respect that,

50:25.979 --> 50:27.894
but what is your angle?

50:27.937 --> 50:29.069
I don't know.

50:30.549 --> 50:33.030
Fill the Garden, win a couple of
championships, maybe.

50:33.073 --> 50:34.509
- For the glory?
- For the glory.

50:34.553 --> 50:36.468
- Why not?
- Okay.

50:36.511 --> 50:38.557
I just don't see you
spending a dime

50:38.600 --> 50:39.862
on a negro player,

50:39.906 --> 50:43.214
when you know the league
will never let him play.

50:43.257 --> 50:45.564
'Cause of the rules.

50:45.607 --> 50:47.044
I like breaking the rules.

50:49.176 --> 50:51.004
You did pretty good
with no Jew,

50:51.048 --> 50:52.658
especially one
with five negros,

50:52.701 --> 50:54.834
will ever play in the Garden.

50:54.877 --> 50:57.402
- Did I say that?
- That's a quote.

50:57.445 --> 50:58.359
- Oh.
- This is not happening

50:58.403 --> 51:00.535
- in your lifetime.
- Okay.

51:00.579 --> 51:02.276
I mean, I can't change your
mind at all.

51:02.320 --> 51:04.278
I mean, think about it,

51:04.322 --> 51:06.324
you get to sleep
in a real bed,

51:06.367 --> 51:08.848
with real sheets,
not on the floor of a bus.

51:08.891 --> 51:10.676
Come on!

51:10.719 --> 51:12.547
- Sheets?
- Sheets.

51:12.591 --> 51:13.853
What kind of sheets?

51:13.896 --> 51:15.594
Egyptian cotton,
you're gonna love it.

51:15.637 --> 51:16.812
You son of a bitch.

51:18.423 --> 51:19.859
- Get out of here.
- Ah, you're a f--

51:19.902 --> 51:21.948
You're the funny one,
Saperstein.

51:21.991 --> 51:24.298
You know I like you,
you know that?

51:24.342 --> 51:26.344
Why don't you call me, when you
get back from the boondocks?

51:26.387 --> 51:27.606
- Okay?
- It's not enough.

51:27.649 --> 51:28.781
Okay.

52:12.216 --> 52:15.306
Okay. You guys are looking good
with the matching uniforms,

52:15.349 --> 52:16.829
and fancy shoes.

52:16.872 --> 52:18.787
Alright.

52:18.831 --> 52:20.006
Here we are, Ref.

52:20.049 --> 52:22.400
Alright. Count it, boys.

52:22.443 --> 52:25.011
Should be 75 shekels a piece
in there for you.

52:25.054 --> 52:26.578
I counted it myself,
now,

52:26.621 --> 52:28.971
let's go over the game plan,
shall we?

52:29.015 --> 52:31.191
You play along with the
shenanigans on the court.

52:31.235 --> 52:33.715
The Trotters win, and everything
works out for everybody.

52:33.759 --> 52:35.282
Easy, right?
Any questions?

52:35.326 --> 52:36.762
No? Great!

52:36.805 --> 52:38.720
- Alright!
- Mr. Saperstein?

52:38.764 --> 52:39.982
- Yeah!
- I just want to say

52:40.026 --> 52:41.549
this is so generous.

52:41.593 --> 52:42.724
Right, right, yeah, yeah.

52:42.768 --> 52:43.899
Let's not count it out here.

52:43.943 --> 52:45.249
It's Saperstein, yeah.

52:45.292 --> 52:46.380
Okay.

52:46.424 --> 52:47.599
Sweet!

52:49.253 --> 52:50.428
What are you doing, pal?

52:50.471 --> 52:52.386
Come on, we got a game
in five minutes.

52:56.695 --> 52:58.218
You ready?

52:58.262 --> 53:00.177
What's the matter?

53:00.220 --> 53:01.830
Oh, buddy, come on,
we're gonna have some fun.

53:03.180 --> 53:05.530
Boom chick-a-boom.
Here we go.

53:07.793 --> 53:09.055
Alright, alright,
you got him.

53:09.882 --> 53:10.883
Here we go.

53:12.145 --> 53:13.277
Yeah!

53:13.320 --> 53:14.408
Alright, alright.

53:14.452 --> 53:15.627
Hey!!

53:15.670 --> 53:17.368
Okay, okay, I got it, I got it.
Hey!

53:17.411 --> 53:18.369
Between your legs!

53:21.285 --> 53:23.112
Over your head, ah!

53:25.898 --> 53:27.421
Watch it, watch it, watch it,
watch it!

53:30.337 --> 53:32.209
Yeah!

53:34.428 --> 53:35.864
Just wait a minute.

53:37.605 --> 53:41.218
Who believes in magic?

53:42.306 --> 53:43.263
I do! I do! Me!

53:43.307 --> 53:44.003
What is this?
What's happening?

53:44.046 --> 53:45.178
Hey Sap!

53:45.222 --> 53:46.832
Just sit back
and enjoy the magic.

53:46.875 --> 53:47.963
Right.

53:48.007 --> 53:49.704
Oh, I think I see somebody.

53:51.402 --> 53:52.403
Excuse me.

53:53.621 --> 53:55.493
- Come.
-Oh, now, wait second.

53:57.451 --> 53:58.322
Just go with it.

53:59.975 --> 54:02.587
Come on,
now, you show me the magic.

54:02.630 --> 54:06.504
All you gotta do is believe.

54:11.030 --> 54:13.380
Do I gotta pay the kid now?

54:13.424 --> 54:14.599
Didn't that feel good?

54:14.642 --> 54:16.296
That felt great.

54:17.776 --> 54:20.126
Alright, let's wrap it up.

54:20.169 --> 54:21.693
Hold on, fellas!

54:23.521 --> 54:24.739
What's the score?

54:26.959 --> 54:31.093
Hey man, it's a little bit to a lot.

54:31.137 --> 54:33.226
Well, let's make it a little
bit more funny.

54:33.270 --> 54:35.054
What you talking about, Sweet?

54:35.097 --> 54:36.011
Follow me.

54:42.496 --> 54:44.324
You're scoring on the other
team's basket.

54:44.368 --> 54:46.065
I'm gonna count on it.

54:46.108 --> 54:47.936
I'm gonna count--
That's for you guys.

54:47.980 --> 54:49.460
Yes.
They just made you get this.

54:51.375 --> 54:53.333
These are all counting.

54:53.377 --> 54:55.640
Keep it going, keep it going, keep it going.

54:55.683 --> 54:56.771
Okay, that's 60!

55:03.212 --> 55:04.431
That's enough.

55:08.783 --> 55:11.220
Now hold on now. Goose!

55:11.264 --> 55:12.744
It's tied up.

55:12.787 --> 55:14.049
Whoa!

55:14.093 --> 55:16.791
And we only have three seconds
left.

55:16.835 --> 55:18.053
Everybody!

55:18.097 --> 55:21.492
3, 2, 1.

55:21.535 --> 55:22.536
You better make that.

55:31.719 --> 55:32.981
And a regulation,

55:33.025 --> 55:35.332
that shot counts,
Harlem wins by 2.

55:36.420 --> 55:37.725
Yeah, thanks.

55:38.857 --> 55:39.771
Wow.

55:39.814 --> 55:41.729
Oh, absolutely.

55:44.036 --> 55:46.081
Sweetwater, what the hell
was that about?

55:46.125 --> 55:47.692
Well, that's entertainment.

55:47.735 --> 55:49.302
That's what you pay me to do.

55:49.346 --> 55:51.304
No, I pay you to stick
to my game plan.

55:52.871 --> 55:54.699
We won.

55:54.742 --> 55:56.004
Just like you planned.

55:57.484 --> 55:58.964
Scoring baskets
for the other team

55:59.007 --> 56:00.357
was never part of my plan.

56:00.400 --> 56:02.184
It never will be.

56:02.228 --> 56:04.186
Okay, Abe.

56:04.230 --> 56:06.319
But I heard you say something
about some shenanigans.

56:08.103 --> 56:09.366
Yeah.

56:11.542 --> 56:13.413
On the bus now!

56:13.457 --> 56:14.806
Let's go! Let's go!

56:16.895 --> 56:18.375
- Thanks, everybody.
- Yeah. We gotta go.

56:18.418 --> 56:20.289
Bus leaves in five minutes with
or without you,

56:20.333 --> 56:22.335
and I mean five.
Let's go, let's go.

56:23.641 --> 56:25.120
- Thanks, folks.
- What's your name?

56:25.164 --> 56:28.907
Hey, that bit with the kid,
now that is entertainment.

56:30.125 --> 56:31.736
Special, Sweets.

56:31.779 --> 56:32.867
Keep doing your thing.

56:32.911 --> 56:34.129
Hmm.

56:35.827 --> 56:37.829
- Thank you, Pop.
- Yeah.

56:37.872 --> 56:38.873
Thank you, ma'am.

56:40.005 --> 56:41.093
I love the hat.

56:43.008 --> 56:44.966
- What a finish.
-Yes.

56:45.010 --> 56:46.446
You signed them autographs,
Goose?

56:46.490 --> 56:48.970
Thanks, man.

56:49.014 --> 56:50.450
Pretty good game.

56:50.494 --> 56:51.451
Yeah, thank you.

56:51.495 --> 56:53.453
Great game indeed.

56:53.497 --> 56:54.585
- Fantastic.
- Thanks Abe.

56:55.847 --> 56:57.805
Great job. Fantastic.

56:57.849 --> 56:59.198
Fans loved that.

56:59.241 --> 57:01.461
-Wonderful.
-It's great.

57:01.505 --> 57:02.810
Yeah, I see that right.

57:12.516 --> 57:15.649
Say Marcus,
how much you got?

57:16.998 --> 57:19.436
- Hm?
- 50.

57:19.479 --> 57:21.916
Goose, you?

57:21.960 --> 57:23.570
50.

57:23.614 --> 57:25.006
Pop?

57:26.617 --> 57:27.792
Oh, I see what's going on.

57:27.835 --> 57:29.271
Come on now, how much you got?

57:32.536 --> 57:34.755
That'll be 50.

57:34.799 --> 57:36.104
50!

57:37.366 --> 57:39.412
Yeah, me too.

57:41.849 --> 57:45.113
Tell the boys how much you pay
the other team, Abe.

57:45.157 --> 57:47.333
Hm.

57:47.376 --> 57:48.508
Is there a problem?

57:50.249 --> 57:52.730
We whipped their butts!

57:52.773 --> 57:54.601
And they get paid more
than we do.

57:55.733 --> 57:57.517
Now that sound right.

57:57.561 --> 57:58.649
Does it, fellas?

57:58.692 --> 57:59.954
No, no.

57:59.998 --> 58:03.218
Them white boys get paid more
to lose,

58:03.262 --> 58:05.786
than we get paid to win.

58:05.830 --> 58:09.181
I mean I don't know,
maybe I should switch teams.

58:09.224 --> 58:10.443
- No.
-Come on.

58:10.487 --> 58:12.401
Make a little extra cabbage
next time.

58:14.229 --> 58:15.840
Big question is,

58:17.232 --> 58:19.626
how much are you making, Abe?

58:29.375 --> 58:31.638
Oh, you were but a babe,
when I created this team.

58:33.640 --> 58:36.556
Hell, when I turned
the Savoy Big Five

58:36.600 --> 58:40.821
into the Harlem Globetrotters,
you were just starting to walk.

58:40.865 --> 58:42.214
I created this team.

58:42.257 --> 58:43.911
I named this team.

58:43.955 --> 58:46.958
I sowed the costumes
you're wearing.

58:48.176 --> 58:50.788
Most importantly,
I'm your boss.

58:52.790 --> 58:55.314
I'm the reason this team exists!

58:55.357 --> 58:59.884
I'm the reason
it's such a success.

58:59.927 --> 59:01.276
Why do I do this everyday?

59:02.364 --> 59:03.757
For you!

59:03.801 --> 59:06.368
I do whatever it takes
to get your next meet.

59:06.412 --> 59:08.588
To get you the recognition
for what you do better

59:08.632 --> 59:12.287
than any other human being
on this planet,

59:12.331 --> 59:13.854
which is play basketball.

59:15.464 --> 59:17.641
There's nobody better.

59:17.684 --> 59:20.774
So just,
stick to playing basketball.

59:21.949 --> 59:23.560
That's what you do.

59:26.475 --> 59:28.042
This ain't about basketball,
Abe.

59:29.391 --> 59:30.915
We're just part of your circus,
man.

59:32.220 --> 59:33.308
I mean you say,

59:33.352 --> 59:36.137
nobody does it better than us.

59:36.181 --> 59:38.400
We beat the world champs, man.

59:39.706 --> 59:42.622
We feel we can beat any team
anywhere,

59:42.666 --> 59:44.232
fair and square.

59:45.538 --> 59:47.279
Listen, Abe,
all we's saying is,

59:47.322 --> 59:49.629
you can pay the other team.

59:49.673 --> 59:51.239
but don't you pay 'em to lose?

59:52.806 --> 59:56.767
That take away all the fun
out of whipping their butts!

59:56.810 --> 59:58.595
- That's right.
- Yes! Right, yeah.

01:00:01.467 --> 01:00:02.599
Okay.

01:00:04.731 --> 01:00:05.950
Fine.

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:09.562
You need me to remind you

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:11.782
what I thought everyone
in this bus,

01:00:11.825 --> 01:00:14.262
thoroughly understood.

01:00:14.306 --> 01:00:17.526
As a negro, you will not play
professional basketball,

01:00:17.570 --> 01:00:19.006
unless you play for me.

01:00:20.268 --> 01:00:23.097
This is my team.
I don't care who you are.

01:00:23.141 --> 01:00:27.058
Nobody, especially you,
is gonna tell me how to run it!

01:00:31.018 --> 01:00:32.933
I got big plans for you, fellas.

01:00:44.597 --> 01:00:45.598
A barn?

01:00:46.686 --> 01:00:48.557
Wow.

01:00:48.601 --> 01:00:50.211
What now?

01:00:50.255 --> 01:00:52.736
It's nice to see you too, Abe.

01:00:52.779 --> 01:00:55.434
Come on,
someone wants to say hi to you.

01:01:03.747 --> 01:01:05.662
Well, I can't imagine

01:01:05.705 --> 01:01:08.142
what brought you two city folks
all the way out here

01:01:08.186 --> 01:01:09.491
to the boondocks.

01:01:09.535 --> 01:01:10.449
Abe.

01:01:11.798 --> 01:01:14.279
You're wasting your time
and mine.

01:01:14.322 --> 01:01:16.542
You know, it beats the hell out
of me,

01:01:16.585 --> 01:01:18.196
what got into you,

01:01:18.239 --> 01:01:21.678
putting together a group
of negro basketball players.

01:01:21.721 --> 01:01:24.724
From Timbuktu Illinois,
you got the whole world,

01:01:24.768 --> 01:01:26.160
thinking you guys are
from Harlem.

01:01:27.509 --> 01:01:30.164
And now you're the best team
on the planet.

01:01:30.208 --> 01:01:32.210
Greatest thing that ever
happened to basketball.

01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:37.650
I recognize the brilliance
in you, Abe.

01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:39.565
We're here to finish what
you started.

01:01:39.608 --> 01:01:42.960
A negro basketball player
will walk on to an NBA court,

01:01:43.003 --> 01:01:45.092
so help me God.

01:01:45.136 --> 01:01:46.746
What do you think about that,
Irish?

01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:48.574
You think that's gonna happen?

01:01:48.617 --> 01:01:50.315
Don't be a sap, Saperstein.

01:01:51.925 --> 01:01:53.361
How much does it ring?

01:01:53.405 --> 01:01:55.059
Huh.

01:01:55.102 --> 01:01:56.234
I'm starting to like this guy
more than I thought I would.

01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:05.286
In this envelope,
is my final offer.

01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:07.419
10,000 sheckles
as you call it.

01:02:07.462 --> 01:02:09.900
Now, that's more money
than anyone will pay

01:02:09.943 --> 01:02:11.162
for a negro player.

01:02:12.641 --> 01:02:14.339
And I'm certain,

01:02:14.382 --> 01:02:16.994
that you'll make sure,
Sweets gets some of it.

01:02:31.791 --> 01:02:33.750
Don't even think about it,
that's my car.

01:02:35.099 --> 01:02:36.796
You're never getting my car,
Abe.

01:02:41.018 --> 01:02:42.236
What do they call that?

01:02:43.368 --> 01:02:44.891
What?

01:02:44.935 --> 01:02:47.589
When someone comes into an
unexpected good fortune.

01:02:48.808 --> 01:02:49.766
Luck of the Irish?

01:02:49.809 --> 01:02:51.506
That's it!

01:02:51.550 --> 01:02:53.552
Irish, today's your lucky day.

01:02:55.032 --> 01:02:56.947
I'm gonna take your $10,000.

01:02:59.123 --> 01:03:00.820
You're gonna take Sweetwater
back with you

01:03:00.864 --> 01:03:03.692
in that beautiful jalopy.

01:03:03.736 --> 01:03:05.216
But when you get there,

01:03:05.259 --> 01:03:08.045
you're gonna find
another 2500 in cash,

01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:11.265
that you'll give to Sweetwater,

01:03:11.309 --> 01:03:12.658
so he can get on his feet,
while he waits

01:03:12.701 --> 01:03:15.661
for his big Knickerbocker
salary to kick in.

01:03:15.704 --> 01:03:17.315
That's my final offer.

01:03:22.842 --> 01:03:24.539
Okay.

01:03:24.583 --> 01:03:26.106
You're all out of excuses, Abe.

01:03:29.327 --> 01:03:30.807
How about that?

01:03:34.462 --> 01:03:36.595
How about that?

01:03:36.638 --> 01:03:37.726
What do you know?

01:03:39.772 --> 01:03:42.557
Hey Irish,
I got this idea,

01:03:42.601 --> 01:03:43.863
if a player can sink at basket

01:03:43.907 --> 01:03:46.387
for much, much further
than normal,

01:03:46.431 --> 01:03:48.563
much further out than normal,

01:03:48.607 --> 01:03:50.304
he should get more
than two points.

01:03:50.348 --> 01:03:52.089
I call it a "three-pointer".
What do you think?

01:03:52.132 --> 01:03:53.264
Phew.

01:03:53.307 --> 01:03:55.048
Jazz up the game a little?

01:03:55.092 --> 01:03:56.702
I don't know,
it sounds pretty crazy, Abe,

01:03:56.745 --> 01:03:57.834
but I don't know if the league
will ever go for it.

01:03:57.877 --> 01:03:59.313
Run it by Podoloff.

01:03:59.357 --> 01:04:01.228
You run it by Podoloff.
What am I, your errand boy?

01:04:01.272 --> 01:04:03.665
Oh, for he--
I'm gonna remember that.

01:04:03.709 --> 01:04:05.711
This guy.

01:04:05.754 --> 01:04:06.712
Hey, Irish.

01:04:07.931 --> 01:04:09.236
- Yeah?
- Promise me

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:10.542
you'll fight for Sweetwater

01:04:10.585 --> 01:04:11.848
to get enough playing time,

01:04:11.891 --> 01:04:15.329
so the NBA can see
what he can actually do.

01:04:15.373 --> 01:04:16.940
Yeah, sure.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.220
- We got Sweetwater.
- Yeah, thank you.

01:04:41.094 --> 01:04:42.269
Hey, hey, listen up.

01:04:44.445 --> 01:04:45.882
Made a decision.

01:04:45.925 --> 01:04:47.144
Sweetwater,

01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:50.887
that was your last game
wearing a Trotter uniform.

01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:52.149
Oh, come on, Abe.

01:04:52.192 --> 01:04:53.411
Come on,
he's just messing around.

01:04:53.454 --> 01:04:54.978
Hey, I was just having some fun
out there.

01:04:55.021 --> 01:04:57.110
You know, I didn't mean
no harm by that.

01:04:57.154 --> 01:04:59.243
Yeah, your nonsense
on the court

01:04:59.286 --> 01:05:01.723
had nothing to do
with my decision.

01:05:01.767 --> 01:05:02.855
You're done here.

01:05:04.378 --> 01:05:06.946
Ned Irish just bought
your contract from me.

01:05:08.426 --> 01:05:12.821
So, your next game will be
in a Knick jersey.

01:05:15.868 --> 01:05:17.217
- Huh.
-The famed New York

01:05:17.261 --> 01:05:21.308
Knickerbockers, has just hired
Sweetwater Clifton

01:05:21.352 --> 01:05:26.139
with a starting salary
of $2,500,

01:05:26.183 --> 01:05:29.447
and I am the Jewish Abe Lincoln.

01:05:30.796 --> 01:05:34.931
You are free to play
in the NBA.

01:05:42.503 --> 01:05:43.809
Hey, come on,

01:05:45.419 --> 01:05:47.247
I'm representing all of us,
huh.

01:05:47.291 --> 01:05:48.509
Got some.

01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:51.948
Take me with you.

01:05:57.301 --> 01:05:58.519
Love you, brother.

01:06:25.285 --> 01:06:28.027
Welcome to the Knickerbockers,
Sweetwater.

01:06:28.071 --> 01:06:30.029
Thank you, Mr. Irish.

01:06:30.073 --> 01:06:31.509
You ready to change the game?

01:06:31.552 --> 01:06:33.163
Oh, I was born ready.

01:06:33.206 --> 01:06:35.034
I believe it.

01:06:35.078 --> 01:06:36.949
- Come on, let's go.
- Alright.

01:06:38.081 --> 01:06:39.256
Welcome.

01:06:39.299 --> 01:06:41.127
Thank you, coach.

01:06:41.171 --> 01:06:43.086
No, no.

01:06:43.129 --> 01:06:46.045
Sweetwater, in the front.

01:06:49.527 --> 01:06:51.311
It's okay.

01:06:51.355 --> 01:06:52.791
Oh, okay.

01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:39.707
But Irish, you know you can't play him.

01:07:39.751 --> 01:07:42.406
Huh. The hell I can't,
and you can bet I will.

01:07:43.798 --> 01:07:45.670
I like to think of him
as the uh,

01:07:45.713 --> 01:07:48.238
as the Jackie Robinson
of the NBA.

01:07:48.281 --> 01:07:51.154
Irish, when you put
a colored player on the court,

01:07:51.197 --> 01:07:54.026
a white player
is sitting on the bench.

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:56.898
Which America are you living
in, joker?

01:07:56.942 --> 01:07:59.336
'Cause your head is
so far up your ass,

01:07:59.379 --> 01:08:01.033
you forgot what
the land of the free,

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:02.904
and the home of the brave,
stands for.

01:08:02.948 --> 01:08:04.384
Mm-hmm.

01:08:04.428 --> 01:08:06.560
Okay, uh, excuse us
for one second, please?

01:08:06.604 --> 01:08:07.866
Come here, come here.

01:08:09.259 --> 01:08:10.695
You gotta help me out.

01:08:10.738 --> 01:08:13.045
I got a board here,
who thinks,

01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:14.699
that you're violating
the decree.

01:08:16.179 --> 01:08:18.485
I'm talking about the future
of the game here, Mo.

01:08:20.226 --> 01:08:23.751
Now, we can either stand
in the way of progress,

01:08:23.795 --> 01:08:26.493
or we can be a part of it.

01:08:26.537 --> 01:08:28.669
You proceed with
a separate agenda like this,

01:08:28.713 --> 01:08:30.932
you're gonna start a war.

01:08:30.976 --> 01:08:32.325
And I'll fight it with you.

01:08:34.458 --> 01:08:36.242
- Okay, as I was saying-
- Okay, ah, excuse me.

01:08:36.286 --> 01:08:38.984
Ah, what-- what my colleague
over here is trying to say

01:08:39.027 --> 01:08:42.118
is that he thinks,
that Sweetwater's style of play

01:08:42.161 --> 01:08:45.643
is going to be uh,
disrespectful to his fans.

01:08:45.686 --> 01:08:47.166
- Exactly.
- Wrong again,

01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:49.690
my distinguished colleagues.

01:08:49.734 --> 01:08:52.606
Sweetwater's style
is pure showmanship.

01:08:53.694 --> 01:08:54.695
And the fans love it.

01:08:54.739 --> 01:08:56.088
That's why he's a big draw!

01:08:56.132 --> 01:08:59.831
That's right.
This league, our league,

01:08:59.874 --> 01:09:01.354
is not gonna survive.

01:09:01.398 --> 01:09:05.010
Not with this vanilla style
of play.

01:09:05.053 --> 01:09:07.186
We need some of that,
what'd you call it?

01:09:07.230 --> 01:09:08.840
"Razzle dazzle"?

01:09:08.883 --> 01:09:10.668
Razzle dazzle, indeed.

01:09:10.711 --> 01:09:12.539
- Wh-- what's he doing here?
- Just hear him out.

01:09:12.583 --> 01:09:14.150
Thanks, boss, I appreciate it.

01:09:14.193 --> 01:09:15.107
Hey, Joe.

01:09:16.456 --> 01:09:18.023
Gentlemen, I will be very brief.

01:09:18.066 --> 01:09:21.809
Sweetwater Clifton's style
of play,

01:09:21.853 --> 01:09:23.681
is creative.

01:09:23.724 --> 01:09:24.986
It's innovative.

01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:27.685
And it brings
about a much needed change

01:09:27.728 --> 01:09:28.903
to this game.

01:09:28.947 --> 01:09:30.775
I know change is hard
for you gentlemen,

01:09:30.818 --> 01:09:32.472
but this is the game,
that is--

01:09:32.516 --> 01:09:34.387
that is being played
on the streets.

01:09:34.431 --> 01:09:36.215
It's being played
in colleges.

01:09:36.259 --> 01:09:37.564
The street game
in college plays,

01:09:37.608 --> 01:09:39.523
it's not the pro ranks,
Lapchick.

01:09:39.566 --> 01:09:40.741
It's the future...

01:09:40.785 --> 01:09:42.439
- Oh...
-...Of the NBA.

01:09:42.482 --> 01:09:44.310
Look, we already took a vote,
Ned.

01:09:44.354 --> 01:09:47.052
Yeah well, the fans didn't vote
that way.

01:09:47.095 --> 01:09:48.575
Let me ask you a question.

01:09:48.619 --> 01:09:50.925
Who sells more tickets
than any other basketball team?

01:09:50.969 --> 01:09:52.623
Go ahead, take a guess,
go ahead.

01:09:52.666 --> 01:09:54.799
We all know it's the Trotters,
Irish.

01:09:54.842 --> 01:09:57.062
That's right.
And since it's been decided

01:09:57.105 --> 01:09:58.585
by the board of governors,

01:09:58.629 --> 01:10:00.805
to not let the Trotters
have a franchise in this league,

01:10:00.848 --> 01:10:02.372
I say,

01:10:02.415 --> 01:10:05.549
we all draft great negro players
and put 'em on our teams.

01:10:07.290 --> 01:10:08.900
How about one each, huh?

01:10:10.118 --> 01:10:11.772
We each pick one player.

01:10:11.816 --> 01:10:13.905
I mean, how hard is that?

01:10:13.948 --> 01:10:14.906
It's what the fans want.

01:10:14.949 --> 01:10:16.124
That's New York fans.

01:10:16.168 --> 01:10:17.822
You don't know my fans.

01:10:17.865 --> 01:10:20.433
What we're trying to get
through to you,

01:10:20.477 --> 01:10:22.087
it's that times change.

01:10:22.130 --> 01:10:23.915
You know,
it wasn't too long ago,

01:10:23.958 --> 01:10:26.918
that a Jew wasn't permitted
to set foot on a hardwood,

01:10:26.961 --> 01:10:28.963
never mind own a team.

01:10:29.007 --> 01:10:31.357
Now, I have three Jewish
players on my roster.

01:10:31.401 --> 01:10:33.794
So, what I'm trying to say
to you is, schmuck!

01:10:33.838 --> 01:10:34.882
Don't be a schmuck!

01:10:36.275 --> 01:10:38.190
Look, no matter how you feel
about this,

01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:40.148
- it's good for business.
- Now, you're talking.

01:10:40.192 --> 01:10:42.455
Irish, let's say that I

01:10:42.499 --> 01:10:45.241
go along
with your letting negros

01:10:45.284 --> 01:10:47.982
into the league program,
what does that make me?

01:10:48.026 --> 01:10:49.549
Does that make me your friend?

01:10:51.203 --> 01:10:52.726
You know what this is?

01:10:52.770 --> 01:10:53.771
Huh?

01:10:53.814 --> 01:10:54.946
You see that?

01:10:56.382 --> 01:10:59.429
That, is my gate take
for the Knickerbocker season.

01:10:59.472 --> 01:11:00.865
The whole season, $1,

01:11:02.301 --> 01:11:05.043
That'll buy you a hot dog
and an orange drink.

01:11:05.086 --> 01:11:05.957
on me.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.611
Be my guest.

01:11:07.654 --> 01:11:12.180
Irish, why are you fighting
so hard for this negro player?

01:11:12.224 --> 01:11:13.486
Because he fought for us.

01:11:14.879 --> 01:11:17.098
Sergeant Sweetwater Clifton

01:11:17.142 --> 01:11:19.884
is a veteran
of the United States Army.

01:11:19.927 --> 01:11:21.625
Sounds pretty distinguished
to me.

01:11:23.366 --> 01:11:24.367
So uh,

01:11:25.716 --> 01:11:27.326
shall we continue
with the draft?

01:11:27.370 --> 01:11:31.852
Okay, uh, next up
is the Celtics' Walter Brown.

01:11:31.896 --> 01:11:35.116
The Boston Celtics pick
Chuck Cooper from Duquesne.

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:38.337
We all know we allow
colored players into the draft,

01:11:38.381 --> 01:11:41.906
but by gentlemen's agreement,
we don't actually select them.

01:11:41.949 --> 01:11:43.516
He's eligible for the draft,
isn't he?

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:44.691
Yeah.

01:11:44.735 --> 01:11:47.128
Well, then, I don't care
if he's striped,

01:11:47.172 --> 01:11:48.826
plaid, polka dot,

01:11:48.869 --> 01:11:52.482
the Boston Celtics
pick Chuck Cooper from Duquesne.

01:11:52.525 --> 01:11:53.657
Okay, next up.

01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:54.832
Washington Capitals.

01:11:54.875 --> 01:11:56.050
Mr. McKinney.

01:11:56.094 --> 01:11:59.184
The Washington Capital
select Earl Lloyd,

01:11:59.227 --> 01:12:00.925
West Virginia State.

01:12:00.968 --> 01:12:02.666
Okay, look,
I'm not telling you again,

01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:05.712
you cannot draft negros!

01:12:05.756 --> 01:12:06.931
Have you seen this guy play?

01:12:06.974 --> 01:12:09.368
Have you seen any of these guys
play?

01:12:09.412 --> 01:12:10.630
We have rules, Podoloff.

01:12:11.762 --> 01:12:12.850
Maybe I want a negro
on my team, huh?

01:12:12.893 --> 01:12:14.286
You're too late.

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:16.157
You should've made a motion
before.

01:12:16.201 --> 01:12:18.029
-What happened today...
-Alright.

01:12:18.072 --> 01:12:19.422
Hey, hey, hey.

01:12:19.465 --> 01:12:21.380
Over here, Earl.

01:12:21.424 --> 01:12:23.034
Mr. Cooper! Mr. Cooper!

01:12:23.077 --> 01:12:24.644
-One right here.
-Mr. Clifton!

01:12:24.688 --> 01:12:27.299
Philadelphia Post, Mr. Lloyd,
we'll start with you.

01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:29.083
How does it feel to be
competing to become

01:12:29.127 --> 01:12:31.172
the first color player?

01:12:31.216 --> 01:12:32.609
To play in the NBA?

01:12:34.437 --> 01:12:35.786
Oh man, um...

01:12:38.092 --> 01:12:40.704
I'm just a small town kid, man,
um, you know.

01:12:42.445 --> 01:12:44.229
I'll be lying to you, man,
if I--

01:12:44.272 --> 01:12:47.363
if I didn't tell you that it
is, it's quite frightening.

01:12:47.406 --> 01:12:48.842
Right. Thank you.

01:12:48.886 --> 01:12:50.061
Mr. Cooper?

01:12:50.104 --> 01:12:52.019
Same question.

01:12:52.063 --> 01:12:53.456
I can say,

01:12:53.499 --> 01:12:54.935
I probably feel
how Jackie Robinson

01:12:54.979 --> 01:12:56.981
felt a couple of years ago.

01:12:57.024 --> 01:13:00.071
Um, for me,
this is a dream come true.

01:13:00.114 --> 01:13:01.377
I grew up playing basketball.

01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:04.815
and now I get to play
at the highest level.

01:13:04.858 --> 01:13:07.121
And to get paid to do
what I love.

01:13:07.165 --> 01:13:09.210
It's-- it's crazy.

01:13:10.908 --> 01:13:12.779
Mr. Clifton,

01:13:12.823 --> 01:13:14.868
before signing with the Knicks,

01:13:14.912 --> 01:13:18.089
you were a basketball star
in your right.

01:13:18.132 --> 01:13:19.395
And some say,

01:13:19.438 --> 01:13:21.875
the best basketball player
in the world.

01:13:21.919 --> 01:13:24.487
And now, you're in the NBA.

01:13:25.662 --> 01:13:26.967
What's going through your mind?

01:13:28.273 --> 01:13:30.231
I don't think it's about
who's the best.

01:13:31.711 --> 01:13:34.148
Yeah, see.

01:13:34.192 --> 01:13:38.370
Ever since I was a young boy,
I always felt like I'm adapting.

01:13:39.719 --> 01:13:41.460
My whole life's been like that.

01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:45.551
That's something we get
from our parents to survive.

01:13:55.605 --> 01:13:58.303

They mumbled and hung up.

01:20:07.890 --> 01:20:09.369
It's probably a wrong number.

My friends at school

Is that true?

01:20:29.302 --> 01:20:34.003
Son, that is a word
of disrespect.

01:20:34.046 --> 01:20:37.615
And we don't ever use that word
in this household, ever.

01:20:37.658 --> 01:20:39.225
You understand?

01:20:39.269 --> 01:20:40.879

you know how that goes?

01:21:19.048 --> 01:21:22.486
Oh... Me, I can't afford
to have an off night.

01:21:22.529 --> 01:21:27.839
And I especially can't afford
to miss any free throws.

01:21:30.624 --> 01:21:31.930
They're free.

01:21:35.629 --> 01:21:36.761
I like this guy, he's fun.

01:21:38.284 --> 01:21:40.069

Max, let's run up some plays.

01:23:03.674 --> 01:23:05.154

Find the extra pass.

01:23:12.074 --> 01:23:13.162
Get that momentum.

01:23:13.205 --> 01:23:15.860
Get that-- okay.

01:23:15.903 --> 01:23:17.253

I'm telling you, Mo,
this story is big.

01:23:28.742 --> 01:23:30.701
Not everyone.

01:23:30.744 --> 01:23:32.964
Ah, that's nothing.

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:34.922
All these guys,
they're gonna fall into line,

01:23:34.966 --> 01:23:36.141
once they see the fans
in the seats.

01:23:36.185 --> 01:23:37.621
Just to admit to me,

01:23:37.664 --> 01:23:41.364
this is causing some
serious problems.

01:23:41.407 --> 01:23:42.887
You met the man.

01:23:42.930 --> 01:23:44.236
Now that I know which one he is.

01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:45.716
No,
but you've never met him, right?

01:23:45.759 --> 01:23:46.891
No, I haven't met him,
but he's in the middle practice.

01:23:46.934 --> 01:23:48.066
Well, let's go say hi to him.

01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:49.372
Come on, let's go say hi.

01:23:49.415 --> 01:23:50.851
Well, he's busy.

01:23:50.895 --> 01:23:52.157
I don't wanna break
his concentration--

01:23:52.201 --> 01:23:56.074
Mo, Mo, he's not gonna
bite you, okay.

01:23:59.208 --> 01:24:00.078
Hey Sweets,

01:24:01.906 --> 01:24:04.256
I want you to meet
the President of the League.

01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:06.128
This is Maurice Podoloff.

01:24:06.171 --> 01:24:09.087
Mo, meet
Nat Sweetwater Clifton.

01:24:09.131 --> 01:24:12.177
Mr. Podoloff,
a pleasure, sir.

01:24:12.221 --> 01:24:13.265
Ah.

01:24:13.309 --> 01:24:16.007
Sergeant, it is my honor.

01:24:16.051 --> 01:24:18.357
Oh, listen, it's...
It's nice to be here.

01:24:18.401 --> 01:24:22.579
Actually, before I forget,
this is yours.

01:24:27.758 --> 01:24:30.369
A check,
to a colored man?

01:24:32.241 --> 01:24:34.069
That'll bounce higher
than a basketball.

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:36.854
- Right.
- Ah.

01:24:36.897 --> 01:24:39.030
If we could figure out
a cash situation.

01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:41.641
Thank you, Sergeant,

01:24:41.685 --> 01:24:44.035
for bringing it
to our attention.

01:24:44.079 --> 01:24:45.950
And I want to tell you
how happy we are

01:24:45.993 --> 01:24:49.127

the color line in the NBA.

<i>And he becomes</i>
<i>the first negro player</i>

01:25:00.182 --> 01:25:01.879
<i>to play in the NBA.</i>

01:25:13.325 --> 01:25:14.761
Someone's here early.

01:25:14.805 --> 01:25:16.546
Oh, going to get some shots up,
you know,

01:25:16.589 --> 01:25:17.808
get stretched out and all.

01:25:17.851 --> 01:25:19.331
How about little one-on-one
rematch?

01:25:19.375 --> 01:25:20.419
I don't think you want that,

01:25:20.463 --> 01:25:21.812
- coach.
- I was trying

01:25:21.855 --> 01:25:22.987
- to kill your confidence.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:24.293
Have you guys seen
today's paper?

01:25:24.336 --> 01:25:26.686
Huh? Here, read, read.

01:25:26.730 --> 01:25:28.123
What the hell's going on?

01:25:28.166 --> 01:25:30.777
Earl Lloyd played for the
Capitals last night

01:25:30.821 --> 01:25:32.823
in Rochester. In Rochester,
for crying out loud!

01:25:32.866 --> 01:25:34.390
"Earl Lloyd...

01:25:34.433 --> 01:25:36.000
...his first game in the NBA.
His appearance also marked

01:25:36.043 --> 01:25:37.262
- the first time..."
- Yeah.

01:25:37.306 --> 01:25:40.178
"...a negro man played
in the new NBA league,

01:25:40.222 --> 01:25:42.180
overshadowing tonight's game
in the New York..."

01:25:42.224 --> 01:25:44.139
I don't under...

01:25:44.182 --> 01:25:45.705
The season starts tonight.

01:25:45.749 --> 01:25:47.446
Yeah, supposed to, should have.

01:25:47.490 --> 01:25:48.578
Didn't!

01:25:54.236 --> 01:25:57.891
Listen, that's good
for Earl Lloyd.

01:26:02.592 --> 01:26:04.681
I think I know who's
responsible for this.

01:26:13.255 --> 01:26:14.473
Hey Mo, what's this uh,

01:26:14.517 --> 01:26:18.912
October 31st game
in Rochester crap, huh?

01:26:18.956 --> 01:26:20.958
It's not even
a regular season game.

01:26:21.001 --> 01:26:22.960
According to the official
NBA schedule,

01:26:23.003 --> 01:26:24.222
the season starts tonight.

01:26:24.266 --> 01:26:25.745
November 1st,
in the Garden!

01:26:25.789 --> 01:26:27.225
Yeah, not this year, Ned.

01:26:27.269 --> 01:26:28.487
"Oh, don't worry, Ned.

01:26:28.531 --> 01:26:30.228
I got your back.
I'll fight your war for you."

01:26:30.272 --> 01:26:31.577
Yeah, sure. Yeah, sure!

01:26:31.621 --> 01:26:33.536
Hey! Hey!

01:26:33.579 --> 01:26:35.320
Just for the record,

01:26:35.364 --> 01:26:38.323
the president has every right
to change the schedule

01:26:38.367 --> 01:26:39.672
at his discretion.

01:26:39.716 --> 01:26:40.891
It's in the bylaws.
Look it up.

01:26:40.934 --> 01:26:42.153
Why'd you do it, Mo?

01:26:42.197 --> 01:26:43.676
Why? Why?

01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:46.375
There was a prediction
of a severe weather storm

01:26:46.418 --> 01:26:49.378
in Rochester tonight!

01:26:49.421 --> 01:26:50.553
So, I changed the schedule.

01:26:50.596 --> 01:26:52.337
Oh, what a load of bull.

01:26:52.381 --> 01:26:54.470
Yesterday, was great
for the league.

01:26:54.513 --> 01:26:57.212
No! It was fantastic for the
league!

01:26:57.255 --> 01:27:00.084
But that was supposed
to be Sweetwater's moment!

01:27:00.127 --> 01:27:02.086
Tonight! In my Garden!

01:27:02.129 --> 01:27:04.088
In New York!
Everybody knew that!

01:27:04.131 --> 01:27:05.350
You knew that!

01:27:06.830 --> 01:27:09.398
You took it away
from the game!

01:27:09.441 --> 01:27:10.660
From the fans!

01:27:12.357 --> 01:27:13.750
But more importantly,
you took it away

01:27:13.793 --> 01:27:14.968
from Sweetwater.

01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:18.624
Too much power for one negro.

01:27:18.668 --> 01:27:20.452
Too big a moment
for the bozos, right?

01:27:20.496 --> 01:27:22.628
Hey. There's nothing I can do
about predicting the weather.

01:27:22.672 --> 01:27:25.109
Oh, don't give me that crap, Mo!

01:27:25.152 --> 01:27:27.242
New York City is center stage!

01:27:27.285 --> 01:27:29.896
The impact here would have been
heard everywhere.

01:27:29.940 --> 01:27:31.985
Just level with me.
Give me a reason.

01:27:32.029 --> 01:27:34.205
You just heard it,
you just said it,

01:27:34.249 --> 01:27:35.902
you just heard it.

01:27:35.946 --> 01:27:37.948
Change is happening.

01:27:37.991 --> 01:27:41.430
But I don't know that my city
can take it, do you?

01:27:41.473 --> 01:27:42.779
Are you sure?

01:27:42.822 --> 01:27:45.303
I don't care about uh...

01:27:45.347 --> 01:27:46.783
confusion in Rochester.

01:27:46.826 --> 01:27:48.785
Who cares?

01:27:48.828 --> 01:27:52.092
But Madison Square Garden,
in the middle of Manhattan?

01:27:53.224 --> 01:27:55.052
You want blood on the floor?

01:27:56.271 --> 01:27:59.317
You want rioting
on Madison Square Garden?

01:28:00.536 --> 01:28:02.320
Huh, I don't-- I don't want
that.

01:28:02.364 --> 01:28:03.713
I don't want that.

01:28:05.758 --> 01:28:07.543
Is that a good enough reason
for you?

01:28:11.286 --> 01:28:13.026
So, Earl Lloyd, Rochester,

01:28:13.070 --> 01:28:15.028
he-- he gets to make history,
and we got what?

01:28:15.072 --> 01:28:17.988
Nothing.
Sweetwater gets nothing.

01:28:18.031 --> 01:28:21.034
Because of what? Some-- some
freaking scheduling glitch.

01:28:21.078 --> 01:28:23.863
Some, some freaking
history making.

01:28:26.039 --> 01:28:28.477
History-making scheduling
glitch.

01:28:40.010 --> 01:28:41.664
You gonna play
Sweetwater tonight?

01:28:43.535 --> 01:28:44.406
What if I do?

01:28:46.103 --> 01:28:48.192
Dangerous, could be trouble.

01:28:49.889 --> 01:28:51.630
I certainly hope so.

01:28:52.414 --> 01:28:53.893
Save me a seat.

01:28:53.937 --> 01:28:55.504
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

01:29:03.555 --> 01:29:04.687
And tonight marks

01:29:04.730 --> 01:29:07.777
Nat Sweetwater Clifton's
first game

01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:09.387
as an NBA player.

01:29:09.431 --> 01:29:10.693
That remains to be seen,

01:29:10.736 --> 01:29:13.304
if Clifton can really complete
in the NBA.

01:29:15.437 --> 01:29:16.916
Set the tone early.

01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:18.265
Fundamental basketball.

01:29:18.309 --> 01:29:19.658
Leave your heart
on that court.

01:29:23.445 --> 01:29:25.229
Sweet, you're starting.

01:29:39.199 --> 01:29:40.723
Hey, that's Sweetwater!

01:30:27.334 --> 01:30:28.466
And this is the moment

01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:30.773
we've all been waiting for.

01:30:30.816 --> 01:30:32.427
History in the making.

01:30:38.476 --> 01:30:40.652
Folks, I wish you could see
what I'm seeing right now.

01:30:40.696 --> 01:30:43.394
The emotion on Sweetwater's face

01:30:43.438 --> 01:30:45.265
and the crowd here looking
at Clifton,

01:30:45.309 --> 01:30:47.790
there is history in the air
here at the Garden.

01:30:54.884 --> 01:30:56.320
That's a travel.

01:30:56.363 --> 01:30:57.495
Indianapolis ball.

01:30:59.845 --> 01:31:01.456
Good call, good call.

01:31:03.066 --> 01:31:04.284
Rebound, rebound.

01:31:04.328 --> 01:31:05.808
Rebound. Rebound.

01:31:10.595 --> 01:31:12.162
There we go. Break it.

01:31:12.205 --> 01:31:13.250
On the break.

01:31:14.512 --> 01:31:15.034
Beautiful.

01:31:16.296 --> 01:31:17.994
Yeah!

01:31:18.037 --> 01:31:20.344
No! No basket!

01:31:20.387 --> 01:31:21.476
That's a travel.

01:31:21.519 --> 01:31:22.868
Blue ball.

01:31:22.912 --> 01:31:24.130
What are you talking about,
Donnie?

01:31:24.174 --> 01:31:25.131
What are you calling here?

01:31:26.393 --> 01:31:27.569
Good call, Donnie.

01:31:33.749 --> 01:31:34.358
Come on.

01:31:36.316 --> 01:31:39.537
That's a foul,
number eight New York.

01:31:39.581 --> 01:31:40.886
Olympian ball.

01:31:43.323 --> 01:31:45.195
Olympians with the ball.

01:31:45.238 --> 01:31:47.110
It's up, it's good.

01:31:47.153 --> 01:31:48.328
A good start
for the Olympians.

01:31:48.372 --> 01:31:49.547
What a great move.

01:31:51.723 --> 01:31:53.595
Open there.

01:31:53.638 --> 01:31:54.857
Get it to Sweets.

01:31:57.686 --> 01:31:59.383
Out of bounds, on the Knicks,

01:31:59.426 --> 01:32:01.559
and Sweetwater continues
to struggle

01:32:01.603 --> 01:32:03.387
in these opening minutes
of the game, folks.

01:32:04.736 --> 01:32:05.911
Oh yeah! That's it.

01:32:05.955 --> 01:32:07.217
That's what we're looking for.

01:32:07.260 --> 01:32:09.001
Come on, guys.

01:32:09.045 --> 01:32:10.568
We gotta put past. There you go.

01:32:10.612 --> 01:32:12.570
McGuire passes to Gallatin,

01:32:12.614 --> 01:32:14.311
hook shot,
and it's no good.

01:32:14.354 --> 01:32:17.314
-It's okay, kid.
-Oh!

01:32:17.357 --> 01:32:19.969
Sweetwater goes down hard.

01:32:20.012 --> 01:32:21.840
Oh my goodness,
I hope he's not injured.

01:32:23.450 --> 01:32:25.278
That's a foul.

01:32:25.322 --> 01:32:26.976
Get the pass. There you go.

01:32:27.019 --> 01:32:28.151
There you go,
keep it moving.

01:32:29.631 --> 01:32:31.415
Get back on team.
Get back on team.

01:32:31.458 --> 01:32:32.416
Come on, Sweets.

01:32:32.459 --> 01:32:33.809
And the Olympians score,

01:32:33.852 --> 01:32:36.246
as they continue
to build on their league.

01:32:39.336 --> 01:32:40.990
There we go, there we go.

01:32:41.033 --> 01:32:43.296
And here's Sweetwater, with a little razzle dazzle.

01:32:43.340 --> 01:32:45.081
A beautiful move
to the basket, and it's good!

01:32:47.039 --> 01:32:48.606
Let's go. Giddy up, giddy up.

01:32:48.650 --> 01:32:50.086
Yeah!

01:32:50.129 --> 01:32:51.348
Hold on.

01:33:04.361 --> 01:33:05.971
What was that, Howard?

01:33:06.015 --> 01:33:07.625
I think that was a new kind
of shot.

01:33:07.669 --> 01:33:10.497
Looked like a donut being
dunked in a cup of coffee.

01:33:10.541 --> 01:33:11.586
Let's call it a "dunk".

01:33:15.024 --> 01:33:16.068
What's going on?

01:33:17.679 --> 01:33:19.245
Was that...

01:33:20.682 --> 01:33:21.813
I got it, I got it.

01:33:21.857 --> 01:33:23.467
Alright, that's gonna be
a technical foul.

01:33:25.077 --> 01:33:27.602
No basket, no basket. Indianapolis ball.

01:33:27.645 --> 01:33:28.864
Technical foul?

01:33:28.907 --> 01:33:30.213
-Yeah.
- No, no basket?

01:33:30.256 --> 01:33:32.258
Did you miss me doing this?
This is no basket.

01:33:32.302 --> 01:33:34.260
I don't understand,
but what is the actual call?

01:33:34.304 --> 01:33:35.348
They did not do a basketball move.

01:33:35.392 --> 01:33:36.785
This is just because,
you didn't--

01:33:36.828 --> 01:33:39.483
you've never seen it before,
doesn't make it illegal.

01:33:39.526 --> 01:33:40.919
We got a technical foul.

01:33:40.963 --> 01:33:42.442
In number eight
of the New York Knicks.

01:33:42.486 --> 01:33:44.314
- Tell me what the call is.
- Get off the court!

01:33:44.357 --> 01:33:45.620
Get behind the line!

01:33:45.663 --> 01:33:46.969
You're-- you're out of line,
Donnie!

01:33:47.012 --> 01:33:49.145
Here we go. Technical foul!

01:33:49.188 --> 01:33:50.363
All the coach in the Knicks
have it.

01:33:50.407 --> 01:33:52.278
That's a ridiculous call!

01:33:52.322 --> 01:33:54.672
- You don't know...
- I did not want to do this, Joe.

01:33:54.716 --> 01:33:55.804
I did not wanna do it.

01:33:55.847 --> 01:33:56.979
I didn't wanna do it!

01:33:57.022 --> 01:33:57.936
Did not want to do it.

01:34:01.113 --> 01:34:01.810
Let's go.

01:34:01.853 --> 01:34:02.898
We're gonna...

01:34:02.941 --> 01:34:04.682
You have to stop
with the hotdogging.

01:34:04.726 --> 01:34:05.857
You think there's
an outside chance

01:34:05.901 --> 01:34:07.598
it was a bad call, Joe?

01:34:07.642 --> 01:34:09.644
Have a seat.
Simmons in for Sweetwater.

01:34:09.687 --> 01:34:10.601
- Coach--
- Don't--

01:34:10.645 --> 01:34:11.689
don't even give them
a reason.

01:34:11.733 --> 01:34:12.690
Don't give 'em a reason.

01:34:12.734 --> 01:34:14.910
Have a seat. Thank you.

01:34:14.953 --> 01:34:16.563
Simmons, get in there
for Sweetwater.

01:34:16.607 --> 01:34:18.130
Let's go. Back out there.

01:34:18.174 --> 01:34:19.654
-Alright, let's go.
-Keep it up,

01:34:19.697 --> 01:34:21.046
don't stop moving.

01:34:22.744 --> 01:34:25.094
Well, it looks like
Sweetwater's gonna be benched.

01:34:25.137 --> 01:34:27.531
It's clear to
the fans here anyway,

01:34:27.574 --> 01:34:29.446
that his flashy game,

01:34:29.489 --> 01:34:31.883
is throwin' a curve ball
into the NBA.

01:34:38.237 --> 01:34:39.325
Here we go.

01:34:39.369 --> 01:34:41.023
McGuire passes to Gallatin.

01:34:45.505 --> 01:34:46.637
Hook shot.

01:34:46.681 --> 01:34:47.986
It's good!

01:34:49.118 --> 01:34:51.294
Back on D. There we go.

01:34:51.337 --> 01:34:53.426
Here come the Olympians.

01:34:53.470 --> 01:34:54.732
And they score again.

01:35:02.348 --> 01:35:03.785
Keep it moving. Get that rebound.

01:35:03.828 --> 01:35:05.569
Vandeweghe misses the shot.

01:35:05.612 --> 01:35:06.701
Back on team!

01:35:16.798 --> 01:35:19.801
That my friends, marks the end
of the first half.

01:35:21.193 --> 01:35:23.239
Look, okay, let's not beat ourselves up.

01:35:23.282 --> 01:35:24.849
Alright? Let-- hey!

01:35:24.893 --> 01:35:26.764
Let's not get down!
Let's not get down!

01:35:26.808 --> 01:35:28.897
Take a breath, everybody.

01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:30.289
Fundamentals.

01:35:30.333 --> 01:35:31.943
That's what wins games.

01:35:31.987 --> 01:35:34.772
That's what wins
championships.

01:35:34.816 --> 01:35:36.818
Alright, take a beat. Be smart.

01:35:36.861 --> 01:35:38.341
Find the open man.

01:35:38.384 --> 01:35:40.125
Take that extra pass,
that's alright,

01:35:40.169 --> 01:35:43.520
and find our rhythm
offensively.

01:35:43.563 --> 01:35:45.652
That's it.
Don't get in our own way.

01:35:45.696 --> 01:35:47.045
- Alright.
- Show me some fundamentals

01:35:47.089 --> 01:35:48.568
out there!
Let's go guys!

01:35:48.612 --> 01:35:49.831
Let's go, Sweets. I know we can do this!

01:35:49.874 --> 01:35:51.484
- We can do this!
- Let's go, Sweets. Come on.

01:35:51.528 --> 01:35:52.572
This is the half that matters.

01:35:52.616 --> 01:35:53.878
Come on,
it's a whole new ball game.

01:35:53.922 --> 01:35:55.053
Let's go.

01:35:56.968 --> 01:36:00.189
I get one more technical foul,
and I'm out, right?

01:36:00.232 --> 01:36:01.625
Yeah, you're out.

01:36:01.668 --> 01:36:03.105
That's why you're not gonna
get a technical foul.

01:36:03.148 --> 01:36:04.410
You're gonna get 30 points.

01:36:04.454 --> 01:36:06.456
Let's go.

01:36:06.499 --> 01:36:09.415
See, when you first come to me,
you were talking about change.

01:36:11.330 --> 01:36:13.245
I still believe in that.

01:36:14.725 --> 01:36:17.684
Change I'm talking about,
though is changing the game.

01:36:19.164 --> 01:36:21.340
You see, this ain't about the
color of my skin no more.

01:36:22.689 --> 01:36:24.953
It's about what I do.

01:36:26.998 --> 01:36:28.304
And how I do it.

01:36:29.827 --> 01:36:32.874
It's about being true
to the game of basketball.

01:36:34.701 --> 01:36:35.877
And right now,

01:36:37.269 --> 01:36:39.489
you've seen it
with your own eyes.

01:36:44.668 --> 01:36:46.844
My game don't belong here.

01:36:51.893 --> 01:36:54.286
My game belong on the streets.

01:36:55.766 --> 01:36:57.420
Not in the NBA.

01:37:00.031 --> 01:37:01.859
Figures.

01:37:01.903 --> 01:37:04.993
Oh, wonder if I can convince
Abe to give me my 12,500 back?

01:37:05.036 --> 01:37:07.560
Oh, cut the gas!

01:37:07.604 --> 01:37:09.693
12,5?

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.392
For my ass?

01:37:17.483 --> 01:37:18.789
Damn!

01:37:26.318 --> 01:37:29.408
It's uh, it's not about
the money, Sweets.

01:37:30.714 --> 01:37:32.107
Never was.

01:37:33.848 --> 01:37:35.893
- I'll see you on the court.
- Yeah.

01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:40.767
And if you're feeling up
to breaking the scoring record,

01:37:40.811 --> 01:37:42.857
we're down by 17.

01:37:54.869 --> 01:37:56.696
Yeah!

01:37:56.740 --> 01:37:57.697
Go!

01:37:57.741 --> 01:37:59.612
Let's go!

01:37:59.656 --> 01:38:02.659
Nat Clifton,
in my office.

01:38:02.702 --> 01:38:03.878
Right.

01:38:10.536 --> 01:38:11.973
I gotta tell you,
that that was

01:38:12.016 --> 01:38:14.540
one of the most incredible
performances

01:38:14.584 --> 01:38:17.630
on the basketball court
that I've ever seen.

01:38:19.632 --> 01:38:21.243
As much as I loved it,

01:38:22.679 --> 01:38:25.116
don't you ever do that again!

01:38:26.770 --> 01:38:28.119
Huh?

01:38:28.163 --> 01:38:30.948
They don't like your style.

01:38:30.992 --> 01:38:33.646
Your hotdogging bigger style.

01:38:33.690 --> 01:38:36.214
Even though it's full of grace,
they don't like it.

01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:41.741
They want you
to maybe grab a rebound,

01:38:41.785 --> 01:38:43.265
block a shot or two.

01:38:43.308 --> 01:38:45.223
Yes, win the game.

01:38:46.746 --> 01:38:49.184
But just not like
how you did it today.

01:38:51.577 --> 01:38:54.189
And then
when they get off your back,

01:38:55.668 --> 01:38:57.192
and let you stand up straight,

01:38:59.455 --> 01:39:03.154
the world would then be able
to see what you do.

01:39:06.592 --> 01:39:08.943
We're five minutes into the second half of play, folks,

01:39:08.986 --> 01:39:12.511
and there's still no sign
of Sweetwater Clifton.

01:39:12.555 --> 01:39:14.122
That's beautiful.

01:39:14.165 --> 01:39:15.558
Excellent!

01:39:15.601 --> 01:39:17.473
And the Olympians score again!

01:39:24.784 --> 01:39:27.222
Vandeweghe shoots and scores!

01:39:30.051 --> 01:39:32.140
Sweetwater has finally rejoined his team

01:39:32.183 --> 01:39:33.358
on the bench.

01:39:44.065 --> 01:39:46.371
Sweets, let's go.

01:39:46.415 --> 01:39:47.807
Come on, here we go!

01:39:52.116 --> 01:39:53.726
And Sweetwater Clifton

01:39:53.770 --> 01:39:56.207
is coming back
into the game, folks.

01:40:01.386 --> 01:40:03.345
Ball! Ball!

01:40:09.046 --> 01:40:10.265
Yeah, get it, go.

01:40:12.354 --> 01:40:13.616
Ah.

01:40:19.926 --> 01:40:21.058
How do you like them apples?

01:40:21.102 --> 01:40:22.407
That's why I like it.

01:40:25.062 --> 01:40:27.804
Get inside, get inside and rebound.

01:40:27.847 --> 01:40:28.805
Let's go!

01:40:28.848 --> 01:40:29.849
Clifton blocks the shot!

01:40:29.893 --> 01:40:31.764
No!

01:40:31.808 --> 01:40:34.071
Foul on number eight
on the Knicks!

01:40:34.115 --> 01:40:35.551
What are you talking about?
That was the best

01:40:35.594 --> 01:40:36.682
freakin' block ever.

01:40:36.726 --> 01:40:38.032
Right here.

01:40:38.075 --> 01:40:39.033
Inches away.

01:40:40.686 --> 01:40:42.079
- Watch out.
- Alright. It's alright.

01:40:42.123 --> 01:40:43.863
- Alright.
- Sweetwater Clifton

01:40:43.907 --> 01:40:44.951
has just been handed

01:40:44.995 --> 01:40:47.302
his fourth foul of the game.

01:40:47.345 --> 01:40:50.392
One more,
and it's bye bye, Sweetwater.

01:40:50.435 --> 01:40:52.829
And now Coach Lapchick
has to make the inevitable move

01:40:52.872 --> 01:40:54.831
and pull Sweetwater out
of the game.

01:40:56.224 --> 01:40:58.443
It's back to the bench for Sweetwater.

01:40:58.487 --> 01:40:59.575
Get that extra pass.

01:40:59.618 --> 01:41:00.619
Don't back down.

01:41:00.663 --> 01:41:02.012
Get that rebound. Get a rebound.

01:41:02.056 --> 01:41:03.231
Another miss.

01:41:03.274 --> 01:41:04.232
Get back on D, everyone.

01:41:04.275 --> 01:41:05.494
Get back on D.

01:41:05.537 --> 01:41:07.322
What are you doing?
Get back on D.

01:41:09.759 --> 01:41:12.022
The Knicks, unable to score, as the Olympians

01:41:12.066 --> 01:41:12.979
- extend their league.
-Alright, that's it.

01:41:13.023 --> 01:41:13.850
We're getting a time-out.

01:41:13.893 --> 01:41:15.765
Time-out.

01:41:15.808 --> 01:41:17.071
Time-out. New York.

01:41:17.114 --> 01:41:18.942
There's a time-out
on the floor.

01:41:18.985 --> 01:41:21.466
Don't ever give up on a play!

01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:23.642
I don't know what you're doing.

01:41:23.686 --> 01:41:26.210
Now-- Wh-- what happened
to our defense, okay?

01:41:26.254 --> 01:41:28.299
We're gonna run some pick
and rolls from McGuire.

01:41:28.343 --> 01:41:30.388
- Coach--
- Don't stop... what?

01:41:30.432 --> 01:41:32.869
We're a much better team
with Sweets in there.

01:41:32.912 --> 01:41:34.958
Listen, coach,
you put me on that floor,

01:41:35.001 --> 01:41:37.134
all focus goes on me.

01:41:37.178 --> 01:41:40.181
We can use that
to our advantage, alright?

01:41:40.224 --> 01:41:43.097
- Let us take this game over!
- Alright.

01:41:44.010 --> 01:41:45.055
You heard the man, let's go.

01:41:45.099 --> 01:41:46.970
Come on, guys.
Let's go, let's go.

01:41:55.674 --> 01:41:57.546
Hey! Vandeweghe!

01:41:57.589 --> 01:42:00.201
Vandeweghe passes to Sweetwater.

01:42:00.244 --> 01:42:01.680
McGuire...

01:42:01.724 --> 01:42:03.769
- Whooo!
-And score.

01:42:08.078 --> 01:42:09.035
Nice, nice.

01:42:09.079 --> 01:42:09.949
Get that rebound!

01:42:09.993 --> 01:42:11.081
Oh!

01:42:12.909 --> 01:42:14.215
Here, Vandeweghe!

01:42:14.258 --> 01:42:15.477
Clear it out! Give it down to Sweets.

01:42:16.956 --> 01:42:18.393
To Sweets, to Sweets. Let's go.

01:42:30.405 --> 01:42:31.319
- There you go.
-Sweetwater

01:42:31.362 --> 01:42:32.537
grabs the rebound,

01:42:32.581 --> 01:42:34.322
and makes his way down
the court.

01:42:42.939 --> 01:42:44.549
Stay out of the paint.

01:42:44.593 --> 01:42:45.768
Get that rebound. Yeah.

01:42:45.811 --> 01:42:47.030
McGuire!

01:42:47.073 --> 01:42:48.249
McGuire, back to me.

01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:50.512
Vandeweghe!

01:42:53.819 --> 01:42:55.081
Hey Sweets, give it here!

01:42:56.431 --> 01:42:57.606
Into the mouth, there we go.

01:43:05.091 --> 01:43:06.571
Alright, it's okay.

01:43:13.230 --> 01:43:15.928
Yeah, it's as if the basketball gods

01:43:15.972 --> 01:43:18.104
have flipped the switch, Marty.

01:43:18.148 --> 01:43:20.716
And Howard, the Olympians have
no idea how to deal with this.

01:43:20.759 --> 01:43:21.978
Neither do the Refs!

01:43:23.197 --> 01:43:26.939
Hey Mo, what do you think?

01:43:26.983 --> 01:43:28.637
What do I think?
I think there's not

01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:30.943
an empty seat
in the whole damn hall.

01:43:30.987 --> 01:43:32.336
That's right.

01:43:32.380 --> 01:43:34.556
We sold more tickets
than Ringling brothers.

01:43:37.298 --> 01:43:38.647
Stay with it. Focus up.

01:43:41.302 --> 01:43:42.912
Aah!

01:43:42.955 --> 01:43:44.566
Sweetwater goes down.

01:43:44.609 --> 01:43:45.871
Look at that.

01:43:45.915 --> 01:43:47.569
What'd you say to me? Huh?

01:43:48.657 --> 01:43:50.224
Foul, foul.

01:43:53.488 --> 01:43:56.752
We've got a full-scale fight right on the floor.

01:43:56.795 --> 01:43:58.014
It's okay, it's okay.

01:43:58.057 --> 01:43:59.668
Just scared of you.
It's okay, it's okay.

01:43:59.711 --> 01:44:01.583
- That boy...
- He's just scared of you.

01:44:01.626 --> 01:44:03.280
It's alright, it's okay.

01:44:03.324 --> 01:44:04.499
That ain't basketball!

01:44:04.542 --> 01:44:07.893
- You don't know basketball!
- Joe, Joe.

01:44:07.937 --> 01:44:09.460
Hey, hey, hey, it's nothing.
I got this.

01:44:14.552 --> 01:44:17.555
This is a crucial moment
in the ball game.

01:44:17.599 --> 01:44:21.298
If it goes the other way,
Clifton is out.

01:44:29.698 --> 01:44:32.091
Alright, we got a personal foul.

01:44:32.135 --> 01:44:34.093
A number 11 on the Knicks.

01:44:34.137 --> 01:44:34.920
The foul was on Gallatin.

01:44:34.964 --> 01:44:35.617
Two shot Blue.

01:44:35.660 --> 01:44:37.358
It's gonna be number 11.

01:44:37.401 --> 01:44:39.838
It's not gonna go
on Sweetwater Clifton.

01:44:39.882 --> 01:44:41.579
He will stay in the ball game.

01:44:41.623 --> 01:44:44.016
The Knicks just dodged
a huge bullet right there.

01:44:44.060 --> 01:44:46.280
Let's go, let's go.

01:44:52.851 --> 01:44:54.940
Now we got two shots.

01:44:54.984 --> 01:44:58.248
Oh, don't you miss.

01:44:58.292 --> 01:44:59.467
It's free.

01:45:06.169 --> 01:45:07.779
Oh.

01:45:11.392 --> 01:45:12.654
I just need one more.

01:45:18.703 --> 01:45:20.531
And the Knicks have the ball.

01:45:20.575 --> 01:45:21.750
Hey, Vandeweghe!

01:45:21.793 --> 01:45:23.186
Vandeweghe into Sweetwater.

01:45:23.229 --> 01:45:24.492
He's looking around.

01:45:24.535 --> 01:45:26.450
He's gonna take the ball
himself.

01:45:28.234 --> 01:45:29.845
The basket's good.

01:45:29.888 --> 01:45:32.935
I got a foul on 15 Blue.

01:45:32.978 --> 01:45:34.719
You got one shot.

01:45:34.763 --> 01:45:36.808
Out of this world, what a game.

01:45:36.852 --> 01:45:38.419
This one's for the books,
Howard.

01:45:38.462 --> 01:45:39.768
Seconds to play,

01:45:39.811 --> 01:45:42.248
and we've got ourselves
a barn burner, Marty.

01:45:48.254 --> 01:45:49.473
Here's the free throw.

01:45:53.042 --> 01:45:54.217
Yes!

01:45:59.135 --> 01:46:00.354
Switch, switch, switch.

01:46:00.397 --> 01:46:03.400
The Olympians attempting a hotdog.

01:46:03.444 --> 01:46:05.446
And Sweetwater steals the ball.

01:46:05.489 --> 01:46:06.708
Time-out. Time-out. Time-out.

01:46:08.623 --> 01:46:09.537
Come on, come on.

01:46:11.016 --> 01:46:12.757
There's a time-out on the floor.

01:46:12.801 --> 01:46:14.063
What are the Knicks gonna
do now?

01:46:14.106 --> 01:46:16.282
We're talking about just
a few seconds left.

01:46:16.326 --> 01:46:17.936
Strategy is everything
right now.

01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:19.329
Here's what I want you to do.

01:46:19.373 --> 01:46:21.244
I want you to give it
to the truth,

01:46:21.287 --> 01:46:22.550
at the top of the key.

01:46:22.593 --> 01:46:23.855
Alright?

01:46:23.899 --> 01:46:25.422
And then you're gonna clear
out of the way.

01:46:25.466 --> 01:46:26.902
Give it to him.
Come on, let's go.

01:46:26.945 --> 01:46:28.207
Alright, we got 10 seconds.

01:46:28.251 --> 01:46:29.383
Let's do it!

01:46:29.426 --> 01:46:30.601
10 seconds!

01:46:30.645 --> 01:46:32.603
Let's go, Knicks. Let's go.

01:46:32.647 --> 01:46:33.865
And the Knicks have the ball.

01:46:39.828 --> 01:46:41.220
Sweetwater at the top
of the key.

01:46:41.264 --> 01:46:42.657
Nine seconds left.

01:46:44.267 --> 01:46:48.532
9, 8, 7, 6,

01:46:48.576 --> 01:46:52.144
5, 4, 3,

01:46:52.188 --> 01:46:54.059
2, 1.

01:46:57.323 --> 01:46:59.325
The Knicks have won the game.

01:46:59.369 --> 01:47:02.764
72-71, the final score.

01:47:02.807 --> 01:47:03.895
What a finish, folks!

01:47:16.255 --> 01:47:17.996
Sweetwater! Sweetwater!

01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:19.650
Sweetwater! Sweetwater!

01:47:19.694 --> 01:47:21.478
Sweetwater! Sweetwater!

01:47:21.522 --> 01:47:23.349
Sweetwater! Sweetwater!

01:47:23.393 --> 01:47:25.090
Sweetwater! Sweetwater!

01:48:11.572 --> 01:48:12.877
Great game, Sweetwater.

01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:16.359
Thank you.

01:48:17.534 --> 01:48:19.449
Goodnight.

01:48:19.493 --> 01:48:20.711
Goodnight.

01:48:29.241 --> 01:48:30.504
I can't believe this.

01:48:32.810 --> 01:48:34.551
I'm sitting here riding
in a cab

01:48:34.595 --> 01:48:38.555
with the Nat Sweetwater Clifton.

01:48:42.777 --> 01:48:44.039
People don't know, man.

01:48:46.128 --> 01:48:47.999
They don't know that when
they're watching an NBA game,

01:48:48.043 --> 01:48:49.827
they're watching you
play your game,

01:48:49.871 --> 01:48:51.699
they're watching Sweetwater.

01:48:51.742 --> 01:48:53.265
You lit that torch.

01:48:53.309 --> 01:48:55.833
No, uh, it ain't like that.

01:48:55.877 --> 01:48:57.008
I uh...

01:48:58.575 --> 01:49:00.882
I'm a small part of it all.

01:49:02.623 --> 01:49:03.885
Just a messenger.

01:49:06.975 --> 01:49:08.454
You definitely delivered.

01:49:09.891 --> 01:49:11.240
Big time.

01:49:13.416 --> 01:49:14.504
Thank you.

01:49:16.245 --> 01:49:17.725
I rather enjoyed the ride.

01:49:19.770 --> 01:49:21.076
Me too.
