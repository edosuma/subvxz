WEBVTT

00:48.548 --> 00:51.009
Mommy and Daddy
will be right next to you.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.552
The lights will go down.

00:52.552 --> 00:55.222
There may be some organ music
as the curtain opens.

00:55.222 --> 00:56.473
Don't be scared.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.392
It'll be dark in there,
you said.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.519
- I don't want to go in.
- But it's fun.

01:00.519 --> 01:02.271
All week,
you've been so excited.

01:02.271 --> 01:03.897
Your first ever movie.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.608
- And the people are gigantic.
- What people?

01:06.608 --> 01:09.236
You said the people
in the movie are gigantic.

01:09.236 --> 01:10.988
Oh, because of
the big screen they're on,

01:10.988 --> 01:12.864
but they're not real, uh, right?

01:12.864 --> 01:15.909
- They're like dreams.
- Dreams are scary.

01:15.909 --> 01:19.413
Some dreams are, but this is
gonna be a nice dream.

01:19.413 --> 01:22.874
About a circus and clowns
and acrobats and, um...

01:22.874 --> 01:24.376
You want to know how it works?

01:24.376 --> 01:26.420
There's a big machine
called a projector.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.213
Inside, there's
a big bright light,

01:28.213 --> 01:29.756
and it projects photographs

01:29.756 --> 01:31.925
- of-of clowns and acrobats.
- And elephants.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.386
- Uh, "projecting" means it
sends them out. -Happy things.

01:34.386 --> 01:36.680
Happy things like light
from a huge flashlight.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.516
But these photographs move past
the light really fast.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.435
24 photos in every second.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.020
Now, in your brain,

01:43.020 --> 01:45.647
each photograph stays
for about a 15th of a second.

01:45.647 --> 01:48.191
That's called
persistence of vision.

01:48.191 --> 01:49.818
The photographs move past

01:49.818 --> 01:51.653
faster than your brain
can let go of them,

01:51.653 --> 01:53.655
and that's how
the movie projector tricks us

01:53.655 --> 01:57.034
into believing that
motionless pictures are moving.

01:57.034 --> 01:59.703
A motion picture.

01:59.703 --> 02:04.041
Movies are dreams, doll,
that you never forget.

02:04.041 --> 02:05.250
You just wait and see.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.626
When it's over,
you're gonna have

02:06.626 --> 02:08.670
the biggest, sloppiest smile
on your face.

02:08.670 --> 02:10.672
- They're letting us in.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.980
Wait till the engines pass.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.413
- Unlock the door.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.085
Pass it down.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.173
- What's that?
- Second section.

02:55.258 --> 02:58.011
Angel. She's on that train.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.013
So what? We got the
dough. Let's get out of here.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.557
Lights. I must turn the lights
down the track.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.351
You crazy lunkhead.
Give me that wheel.

03:04.351 --> 03:07.104
We are going to--
down the track!

03:09.189 --> 03:11.441
The train! Stop the train!

03:11.441 --> 03:13.193
Stop the train!

03:14.569 --> 03:17.197
Stop! Can't you see the lights?!

03:17.197 --> 03:18.490
Stop!

03:20.450 --> 03:22.035
First section! Hold it!

03:22.035 --> 03:25.747
- Angel! Angel!

03:48.145 --> 03:50.397
What was your favorite part?

03:54.401 --> 03:57.320
Sammy, what do you want
for Hanukkah?

03:57.320 --> 03:59.698
I told you
this wasn't a good idea,

03:59.698 --> 04:02.576
what with all of his
A-N-X-I-E-T-I-E-S.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.619
Kids his age have big
I-M-A-G-I-N-A-T-I-O-N-S.

04:04.619 --> 04:08.540
No fair spelling out
the long words.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.295
The lights change
how everything looks.

04:13.295 --> 04:14.713
It's hard to find our house.

04:14.713 --> 04:17.257
Ours is the dark house
with no lights.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.187
That's what I want for Hanukkah.

04:30.187 --> 04:32.105
- What?
- Christmas lights!

04:33.440 --> 04:34.733
Sorry, dolly.

04:34.733 --> 04:37.110
Jews don't get Christmas lights.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.945
Eight nights of candlelight.

04:46.828 --> 04:49.998
Can I sleep
with the oscilloscope?

05:03.678 --> 05:05.680
Get going.
We got to burn rubber.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.015
- What's that?
-Second section.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.642
Angel. She's on that train.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.060
-The lights.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.603
I must turn the lights
down the track.

05:11.603 --> 05:12.646
-Stop the train!

05:12.646 --> 05:13.855
Stop the train!

05:13.855 --> 05:15.607
-Angel!

05:17.776 --> 05:21.446
Mommy! Mommy!

05:23.323 --> 05:25.283
I know what I want for Hanukkah!

05:25.283 --> 05:27.327
I know what I want
for Hanukkah!

05:38.838 --> 05:40.423
...Hanukkah!

05:42.217 --> 05:44.010
Thank you!

05:47.347 --> 05:48.932
Sammy.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.184
-Oh, my God.
- Whoa.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.019
I'm so excited.

06:31.224 --> 06:34.728
Okay, so the outside grounds,
the middle conducts the power,

06:34.728 --> 06:37.063
and these two metal wheels
under the engine

06:37.063 --> 06:38.607
complete the circuit.

06:38.607 --> 06:41.735
So, new, Mr. Engineer?

06:41.735 --> 06:44.404
RCA gave you a raise?

06:44.404 --> 06:47.032
That is
one expensive trolley car.

06:47.032 --> 06:48.908
It's not a trolley car.
It's a Lionel train.

06:48.908 --> 06:51.036
No raises for the computer guys
this year.

06:51.036 --> 06:52.120
Next year, maybe.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.580
Your moonlighting son
is paying for it

06:53.580 --> 06:55.790
by filling up my house
with broken TVs.

06:55.790 --> 06:58.251
Repair work, that's how.

06:58.251 --> 07:01.421
Oy, careful he doesn't
electrocute himself.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.300
- Hold on.
- You're okay.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.886
You're not taking that fancy
train to Florida without me.

07:07.886 --> 07:09.554
Hey, look.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.681
She's down on the floor.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.683
Who's gonna help her up?

07:13.683 --> 07:15.268
Who says I'm getting up?

07:15.268 --> 07:19.064
I'm going to Miami
on the Sammy Limited.

07:19.064 --> 07:20.940
Go ahead.

07:22.651 --> 07:24.110
- Ooh.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.596
I precisely engineer toys.

08:33.596 --> 08:35.098
You can play with them

08:35.098 --> 08:36.474
when you've learned
to treat them with respect.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.768
I do respect them. I love them.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.603
I know you do, but you can't
just love something.

08:40.603 --> 08:43.273
You also have to
take care of it, right?

08:47.485 --> 08:50.530
Maybe we can play together
with them this weekend.

08:58.621 --> 09:01.124
But I need to see them crash.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.171
I don't understand.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.882
Why does he need
to see them crash?

09:13.052 --> 09:14.220
It's late.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.764
You don't want
to shut your light?

09:15.764 --> 09:16.931
Mm. In a minute.

09:16.931 --> 09:19.559
I'm still wide-awake.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.061
You see these descending notes?

09:22.061 --> 09:24.689
That's called a lament bass.

09:27.484 --> 09:30.236
You should play it on the radio
on that arts program.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.113
- Oh. -They keep
asking you to go back.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.907
I don't have time for that. Mm.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.784
Well, we can hire a sitter.

09:35.784 --> 09:37.076
Who can afford that? Forget it.

09:37.076 --> 09:39.287
That was another life.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.581
That was two kids ago.

09:46.795 --> 09:49.964
You know what I miss most
about the piano?

09:51.800 --> 09:54.969
Surrendering to the score.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.599
Knowing Bach is
gonna tell you how--

09:59.599 --> 10:02.018
First this note,
then this chord,

10:02.018 --> 10:06.606
then you open your hand,
you stretch down an octave...

10:16.032 --> 10:20.078
Making a little world
you can be safe and happy in.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.378
Thank you.

10:37.011 --> 10:40.640
That's why he needs
to watch them crash.

10:41.975 --> 10:46.187
He's trying to get
some kind of control over it.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.404
Sammy?

10:55.488 --> 10:59.033
We're going to use
Daddy's camera to film it.

10:59.033 --> 11:01.286
Only crash the train once, okay?

11:01.286 --> 11:02.996
Then, after we get
the film developed,

11:02.996 --> 11:04.497
you can watch it crash
over and over

11:04.497 --> 11:06.833
till it's not so scary anymore.

11:06.833 --> 11:09.419
And your real train
won't ever get broken.

11:11.588 --> 11:14.424
One more thing, dolly.

11:14.424 --> 11:17.051
Let's not tell your father.

11:17.051 --> 11:20.388
It'll be our secret movie,
just yours and mine.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.392
- Okay?
- Okay.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.769
Sorry I'm late.

11:26.769 --> 11:28.813
I picked up
Ms. Moynahan's Motorola.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.356
There's no room left
in the workshop.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.358
- Where should I put it?
- The living room, I guess?

11:32.358 --> 11:34.193
Okay.

11:34.193 --> 11:37.071
Hey, uh, sorry I'm late.
I picked up Mrs. Fabelman.

11:37.071 --> 11:38.364
Where should I put her?

11:40.158 --> 11:42.452
Ow! Ow, ow, ow.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.787
- Did the mail come?
- It's on the table.

11:47.206 --> 11:48.791
Cossack.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.895
- This is brisket?
- My movie!

12:10.980 --> 12:12.732
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.317
After supper.

12:15.193 --> 12:17.195
The amount of magnetism
is increased by

12:17.195 --> 12:19.447
how magnetically permeable
the core material is.

12:19.447 --> 12:21.908
The tricky thing is
how permeable we can make it.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.369
Am I supposed to be
following any of this?

12:24.369 --> 12:26.913
You know what
a magnetic field is, right?

12:26.913 --> 12:29.958
Uh, yeah. Well, sure.
I mean, it...

12:29.958 --> 12:32.168
Sammy, do you know
what a magnetic field is?

12:32.168 --> 12:33.920
- Can I be excused?
- Nope.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.755
But I need to,
just for a minute.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.423
- What's so urgent?
- Honey.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.258
This tastes funny, Burt.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.511
It tastes funny
on a plastic fork.

12:41.511 --> 12:44.597
- Ma.
- Is she saving the silverware

12:44.597 --> 12:46.808
for when the Eisenhowers
drop by?

12:46.808 --> 12:48.434
The problem is
we're using vacuum tubes,

12:48.434 --> 12:50.269
not transistors,
and magnetic cores

12:50.269 --> 12:53.106
- to try to access memory...
- 35,000 magnetic cores.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.941
Hey, Sam, you know
on your father's camera

12:54.941 --> 12:56.192
when the film runs out?

12:56.192 --> 12:57.777
When that happens,
what do you do?

12:57.777 --> 12:59.612
- Load more film.
- The same with computers.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.614
You have to load more tape, and
that slows everything down...

13:01.614 --> 13:03.449
Mitz, the chopped liver
was beyond belief.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.243
- ...load it with data,

13:05.243 --> 13:07.412
and instead of changing tapes
every ten seconds,

13:07.412 --> 13:09.122
this new machine
he's engineering...

13:09.122 --> 13:11.582
- The BIZMAC!
- The BIZMAC!

13:11.582 --> 13:13.584
It can search for information

13:13.584 --> 13:14.877
through all these tapes at once.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.129
You never need
to change any of them.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.255
It'll be ten times faster.

13:17.255 --> 13:20.258
I love Burt's brain.

13:20.258 --> 13:23.469
Especially when you're around
to explain what's in it.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.017
Mom, I have to go upstairs now.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.727
Not until
you've finished eating.

13:30.727 --> 13:31.853
He cleaned his plate.

13:31.853 --> 13:33.312
No, he didn't.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.982
- Sammy.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.900
Hey, Natalie, I think there's
something under your plate.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.110
- Sammy.
- No, there isn't.

13:39.110 --> 13:40.069
Lift it up and check.

13:40.069 --> 13:41.446
I saw it moving.

13:50.329 --> 13:51.664
Licorice.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.916
If there's anything
I'm a sucker for,

13:53.916 --> 13:54.917
it's licorice.

13:57.128 --> 14:00.048
Uncle Bennie,
that was so disgusting!

14:00.048 --> 14:03.134
- No, no!
- Natalie, he is not your uncle.

14:03.134 --> 14:05.553
Also, he is not that funny.

14:05.553 --> 14:08.681
Oh, "uncle" is a term
of affection.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.309
Natalie, he's not related.

14:11.309 --> 14:16.189
He's only always here
because he works for my son.

14:16.189 --> 14:19.108
He's only always here because
he's my best friend.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.360
And deep down inside you,
Mrs. Fabelman,

14:21.360 --> 14:23.488
admit it, I'm your friend, too.

14:23.488 --> 14:27.408
Deep down inside of me
is none of your business.

14:28.534 --> 14:29.994
Sid Caesar's on tonight.

14:29.994 --> 14:32.038
Help me.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.540
- Natalie, get that corner.
- What?

14:34.540 --> 14:35.958
Get the corner. Get the corner.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.710
Can I help you take it out?

14:57.396 --> 14:59.273
Sammy.

15:37.728 --> 15:40.439
I had to crash it
a whole lot of times,

15:40.439 --> 15:43.568
- but the train never got hurt.
-Golly.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.780
I thought that was
The Greatest Show on Earth.

15:47.780 --> 15:52.702
Oh, more,
more, more, more, more.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.413
Head back. Open.

15:55.413 --> 15:58.207
- Ah.
- Candy corn in.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.626
- Say, "Ah."

16:00.626 --> 16:02.253
Head back.

16:03.129 --> 16:06.132
- Ketchup. Okay.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.508
Scream like it hurts.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.093
Pull it!

16:22.899 --> 16:24.859
Sammy!

16:26.861 --> 16:28.321
Oh.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.777
Take off the blindfolds.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.789
Sammy?

17:20.539 --> 17:23.376
Reggie, Natalie,
come downstairs pronto.

17:23.376 --> 17:26.545
Your father has an announcement.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.050
General Electric
wants to hire me

17:31.050 --> 17:33.469
because of what I did on BIZMAC.

17:33.469 --> 17:36.764
They want to use my
electronic library system to--

17:36.764 --> 17:38.724
Well, I-I don't think
they have any notion

17:38.724 --> 17:40.017
of what I can do with it.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.228
And I'll make more money.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.063
Is Uncle Bennie coming, too?

17:44.063 --> 17:46.649
Well, D-Daddy and me
haven't had a chance to think

17:46.649 --> 17:49.402
- about Uncle Bennie, but...
- Bennie, no. He lives here.

17:51.696 --> 17:53.322
Burt.

17:56.325 --> 17:57.910
I'll miss
your Uncle Bennie, too,

17:57.910 --> 18:00.621
but Phoenix is a real neat city.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.123
It's on the rise.

18:02.123 --> 18:04.500
They've only just hired me.
I've got no pull there yet.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.377
I can't ask General Electric

18:06.377 --> 18:08.087
to hire somebody else
on my say-so.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.922
- That's not how it works.
- Don't ask them.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.924
Do it yourself.
They're hiring you to manage.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.010
Managers hire. Hire Bennie.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.720
Uh, who's watching-- Sammy!

18:15.720 --> 18:17.596
- He's got to make a name for
himself at RCA. -

18:17.596 --> 18:19.348
- Come here. Come here.
-That's what I did.

18:19.348 --> 18:20.725
He'll stay in New Jersey,

18:20.725 --> 18:22.560
get out from
under my shadow and then...

18:22.560 --> 18:24.228
There's a tornado outside!

18:24.228 --> 18:25.855
Yeah, well,
there's a bigger one in here.

18:25.855 --> 18:28.774
Honestly, honestly, Burt,
sometimes I want to shake you.

18:28.774 --> 18:31.610
You're-you're gonna leave him
behind with just a-a shrug?

18:31.610 --> 18:33.195
Mommy! Mommy!
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

18:33.195 --> 18:34.864
"We'll see ya later."

18:34.864 --> 18:37.700
And once we're gone, who will
he have left in New Jersey?

18:37.700 --> 18:39.535
You have an opportunity
to help your best friend.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.078
- Mommy, look!
- Mommy! Mommy!

18:41.078 --> 18:42.455
- Honestly, wake up.
- Mom! Mom!

18:42.455 --> 18:44.999
- What?! -Look!
There's a tornado outside.

18:44.999 --> 18:46.709
- I'm scared.
- Just go.

18:48.919 --> 18:51.964
Wow! Ah!

18:54.800 --> 18:56.344
Oh!

19:00.264 --> 19:02.141
You weren't kidding!

19:03.434 --> 19:05.478
How close is it?

19:07.980 --> 19:10.191
Why does the sky look orange?

19:11.817 --> 19:12.985
Come on!

19:12.985 --> 19:14.695
Come on. Let's go see.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.616
- Get in, get in!
- Get in!

19:18.616 --> 19:21.744
Mitz? Where are you going?

19:23.329 --> 19:25.164
Mitz, where are--

19:25.164 --> 19:27.833
- Hey!

19:27.833 --> 19:29.919
Where are you going?

19:32.755 --> 19:34.006
Mitz!

19:36.717 --> 19:38.427
Mitzi!

19:44.517 --> 19:45.851
Where is it?

19:45.851 --> 19:47.395
- I can't see it anymore.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.188
Up ahead somewhere.
We'll find it.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.857
Mom, it's there. It's there!

19:56.028 --> 19:58.155
- Is this s-safe?

19:58.155 --> 20:00.825
Of course it's safe.
I'm your mother.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.079
Mom, stop!

20:29.437 --> 20:31.480
Everything happens for a reason.

20:31.480 --> 20:34.567
Everything happens
for a reason.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.445
Everything happens for a reason.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.239
Say it with me.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.658
Everything happens
for a reason.

20:42.658 --> 20:46.245
Everything happens for a reason.

20:46.245 --> 20:49.039
Everything happens
for a reason.

20:49.039 --> 20:51.125
Everything happens for a reason.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.604
I think there's
something dead in the road.

21:19.778 --> 21:22.448
- Reggie, wave in the camera.

21:45.888 --> 21:48.474
- Ooh, look.
- There it is!

21:48.474 --> 21:49.934
- There it is. Wow.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.852
Whoa!

21:51.852 --> 21:53.896
Let me out. I want to take
a shot of him pulling in.

21:53.896 --> 21:55.606
- No!
- No, I have to pee now!

21:55.606 --> 21:57.483
Me, too! Now! No!

22:02.905 --> 22:05.574
No! I have to pee!

22:05.574 --> 22:07.368
- Keep coming.
- No!

22:09.328 --> 22:11.789
Keep coming, Dad.
You're doing great.

22:14.124 --> 22:18.045
And...

22:18.045 --> 22:20.297
Stop.

22:20.297 --> 22:21.882
Freeze.

22:30.432 --> 22:31.850
- Where's the lunch box?
- Wow.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.394
Where's the lunch box?! Hurry!

22:33.394 --> 22:35.020
Guys, look at the monster
Sammy caught.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.730
I got the babies.

22:36.730 --> 22:38.732
- Sal found babies.
- Look at that.

22:38.732 --> 22:39.858
Sammy, Dean, come on.

22:39.858 --> 22:41.527
There's a huge nest right there.

22:41.527 --> 22:43.445
- Come on, guys.
- A big one, Sammy.

22:43.445 --> 22:45.322
- Oh, God.
- Oh!

22:45.322 --> 22:46.657
It's a whole herd of 'em.

22:46.657 --> 22:47.908
Scorpions come in nests.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.577
No, actually,
it's a bed of scorpions.

22:49.577 --> 22:51.870
- No, it's a nest.

22:51.870 --> 22:54.081
The baby scorpions
are called "scorplings."

22:54.081 --> 22:55.332
They're twice as venomous.

22:55.332 --> 22:56.542
That's-that's why
the lab pays more.

22:56.542 --> 22:58.085
There's got to be
like 50 of 'em.

22:58.085 --> 22:59.295
Well, how much is the
laboratory gonna pay for them?

22:59.295 --> 23:00.713
50 cents per baby.

23:00.713 --> 23:03.173
- That's 25 bucks!
- We're rich. -

23:03.173 --> 23:05.509
Well, what are we gonna buy?

23:08.012 --> 23:09.471
12 dollars even.

23:10.222 --> 23:13.309
Well, it's the merit badge
for photography, not movies.

23:13.309 --> 23:15.811
The manual says you got to tell
a story with still pictures.

23:15.811 --> 23:17.688
Yeah, but all a movie is
is still pictures.

23:17.688 --> 23:19.565
You just put a bunch of them
together and they move.

23:19.565 --> 23:22.067
Okay, but what kind of movie
are we making?

23:22.067 --> 23:24.695
Ooh. Sammy, look.
It's Janet Benedict.

23:27.906 --> 23:29.950
Hey, go on and talk to her.
I dare you.

23:29.950 --> 23:31.410
He already talked to her.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.995
- No way.
- Like hell.

23:32.995 --> 23:34.913
No way.
He actually spoke to her?

23:34.913 --> 23:37.082
He did. He did.
He walked right up to her.

23:37.082 --> 23:38.584
- And he...
- You went up to Janet Benedict?

23:38.584 --> 23:40.002
- What did you say to her?
- Nothing.

23:40.002 --> 23:41.629
Oh, come on.
Tell them what happened, Sammy.

23:41.629 --> 23:42.880
Nothing happened.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.424
Something happened. Come on.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.801
Could be the same one.

23:48.969 --> 23:51.889
"Overland." Say, I think
it is the same one.

23:52.640 --> 23:54.433
Well, I declare.

23:58.187 --> 23:59.647
So, uh,

23:59.647 --> 24:02.816
Sammy kind of sidewinds his way
in her direction.

24:02.816 --> 24:05.069
And he's trying to, um...
he-he's trying to work up

24:05.069 --> 24:07.655
the nerve to say something
slick and smooth like,

24:07.655 --> 24:09.573
-"Hey, Jan, baby."
- No, I wasn't.

24:09.573 --> 24:11.158
- You're making this up.

24:11.158 --> 24:13.577
But-but he sees that Janet's
got something on her nose.

24:13.577 --> 24:14.870
So now he's thinking, "Cool.

24:14.870 --> 24:16.538
Here's my excuse to go up
and talk to her."

24:16.538 --> 24:19.917
So he goes and he says, "Hey,
uh, sorry, Janet.

24:19.917 --> 24:22.211
It-it looks like you have
a little smudge on your nose."

24:22.211 --> 24:24.046
- Shut up, Hark.
- But it wasn't a smudge.

24:24.046 --> 24:25.964
- It looked like a smudge.
- And it wasn't little.

24:25.964 --> 24:27.549
Hark, shut up!

24:28.550 --> 24:30.469
- It was a booger!

24:30.469 --> 24:31.929
A big, fat,

24:31.929 --> 24:33.931
- Janet Benedict booger.

24:36.517 --> 24:38.811
It was huge.

24:43.607 --> 24:44.817
Hey, Sammy.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.610
Stand and deliver.

24:46.610 --> 24:49.238
What kind of movie
are we gonna make?

24:49.988 --> 24:53.283
Stand and deliver.

24:55.077 --> 24:56.829
No, keep screaming.
Keep screaming.

25:00.124 --> 25:02.167
I need more dust. Dad, can you
grab the sandwich board?

25:02.167 --> 25:04.753
No, no. God, no,
no more dust. No.

25:04.753 --> 25:06.296
Reggie, stop coughing!

25:06.296 --> 25:08.173
- I'm coughing
because there's dust. -Okay.

25:08.173 --> 25:09.883
- More dust, fellas. -Natalie,
say, "Please don't kill me."

25:09.883 --> 25:10.884
- All right.
- Reggie, stop coughing.

25:10.884 --> 25:12.511
You're being dramatic.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.012
Mr. Fabelman, you're getting
dirt inside my stagecoach.

25:14.012 --> 25:15.848
Don't you want me
to be dramatic?

25:15.848 --> 25:17.141
- Don't look into the camera.
- Well, we'll clean it out.

25:17.141 --> 25:18.642
Guys, stop looking
into the camera.

25:18.642 --> 25:20.352
- I can't use any of this.
-Dad!

26:11.695 --> 26:13.071
Fake.

26:15.115 --> 26:16.658
Totally fake.

27:06.250 --> 27:08.252
- You hear it?

27:08.252 --> 27:10.170
She has got to cut
those goddamn fingernails

27:10.170 --> 27:11.964
before she goes
on live television.

27:11.964 --> 27:14.550
- I have to perform this
tomorrow. -

27:14.550 --> 27:16.510
It's a difficult piece.

27:16.510 --> 27:18.220
It's a very big deal for me.

27:18.220 --> 27:20.639
All I asked was for you
to keep your big traps shut

27:20.639 --> 27:23.475
and listen
to my dress rehearsal.

27:23.475 --> 27:24.893
Sorry, Mitz. It's wonderful.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.311
You hear how
the rising arpeggios

27:26.311 --> 27:28.021
- lift up the sad notes?

27:28.021 --> 27:30.524
It's in F minor, but your mom
makes it sound so alive.

27:30.524 --> 27:32.568
She makes it sound like
she's playing a typewriter.

27:33.569 --> 27:35.445
Oh, no.

27:35.445 --> 27:36.780
Not this again.

27:42.035 --> 27:43.829
Do you hear it? Am I clicking?

27:43.829 --> 27:46.081
I concentrate
on your playing, but...

27:46.081 --> 27:47.666
Bu-- Oh, great. But what?

27:47.666 --> 27:49.084
But people can hear it
in Tucson.

27:49.084 --> 27:50.002
- Maybe I've gotten used to it.

27:50.002 --> 27:51.003
Maybe GE should make

27:51.003 --> 27:52.170
rubber tips for fingernails.

27:52.170 --> 27:54.673
All right, Mitzi Fabelman.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.300
Time to face the music.

27:56.300 --> 27:58.010
- Oh, boy.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.761
You stay away from me
with those things.

27:59.761 --> 28:01.346
- It's Beethoven, damn it.
- No, no, no!

28:01.346 --> 28:03.015
- It is not Morse code. Come on.
- No! Stop! Stop! Stop it!

28:03.015 --> 28:04.516
He has a point, though,
especially with

28:04.516 --> 28:06.184
the polydirectional
ribbon microphones

28:06.184 --> 28:07.436
- they have on television
stage... -

28:09.897 --> 28:11.481
Come on. You married her.

28:11.481 --> 28:12.858
Dad, don't.

28:12.858 --> 28:14.192
Do it. Do it.
Do it. Do it. Do it!

28:14.192 --> 28:15.986
I will scratch you.
Don't think I won't!

28:15.986 --> 28:17.654
Do you think Arthur Rubinstein

28:17.654 --> 28:19.072
- had fingernails?

28:19.072 --> 28:20.616
- Horowitz? Schnabel?
- Do not think about it.

28:20.616 --> 28:22.034
- Kempff?
- No, no, no.

28:22.034 --> 28:23.785
- Liberace.
- No, no, no, no.

28:23.785 --> 28:24.953
- Not my nails.
- Come on, Fabelman.

28:24.953 --> 28:26.330
Show her
who's General Electric's

28:26.330 --> 28:27.956
- product design manager.
- No, my beautiful nails.

28:27.956 --> 28:30.500
I paid a buck 50
at the beauty parlor for these.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.419
Oh, no.

28:32.419 --> 28:36.882
- One, two, three.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.887
Get off of me, Delilah.

28:41.887 --> 28:43.430
- Delilah?
- Okay, the fun's over.

28:43.430 --> 28:45.682
I'll do the rest myself.

28:50.938 --> 28:53.523
Oh.

28:53.523 --> 28:54.858
Oh, great.

28:54.858 --> 28:57.194
Just great.
Well, that decides it.

28:57.194 --> 28:59.613
I'm gonna play the program
from memory tomorrow.

28:59.613 --> 29:04.326
No sheet music, short nails,
like a real performing artist.

29:53.041 --> 29:54.626
Did you drop your gun?

29:54.626 --> 29:55.669
Come on.

30:06.972 --> 30:08.557
That's me.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.895
Real scary, Sheriff.

30:23.238 --> 30:25.365
- Whoa.

30:38.295 --> 30:40.255
- Whoa.

30:43.759 --> 30:46.094
H-How'd you do that?

30:48.764 --> 30:50.390
How'd you do that?

31:08.742 --> 31:10.786
- Whoa!

31:21.671 --> 31:23.507
Go, Sammy!

31:26.885 --> 31:28.887
It's kind of like what I do,
isn't it,

31:28.887 --> 31:31.098
what a movie director does?

31:31.098 --> 31:32.432
- It is?
- I figure out

31:32.432 --> 31:34.226
what my division
needs to accomplish,

31:34.226 --> 31:37.521
then I work out how my guys
are gonna get it done.

31:38.396 --> 31:40.607
Yeah, it is. Yeah, sort of.

31:40.607 --> 31:43.360
How'd you make it look like
the guns were really firing?

31:45.654 --> 31:47.405
I did it with pins.

31:47.405 --> 31:48.740
Pins.

31:48.740 --> 31:51.076
Yeah, I poked holes
in the film with pins.

31:51.076 --> 31:52.786
- Sammy.
- Yeah.

31:52.786 --> 31:54.371
Thinking like an engineer.

31:54.371 --> 31:56.248
Watch the road, Dad.

31:57.999 --> 31:59.709
Sammy, watch the road.

31:59.709 --> 32:01.294
I can't edit
without an editing machine.

32:01.294 --> 32:03.588
I have to be able
to cut and splice, and I...

32:03.588 --> 32:06.216
Let's revisit it
after the camping trip.

32:06.216 --> 32:08.468
It's three hours
to the national forest.

32:08.468 --> 32:11.680
If you get your license,
you can help with the driving.

32:11.680 --> 32:13.056
Okay.

32:14.683 --> 32:16.726
"You are approaching
a railroad crossing

32:16.726 --> 32:18.937
"with no warning devices
and limited visibility.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.438
The speed limit is..."

32:20.438 --> 32:22.023
See, the thing is, though,
about my new movie,

32:22.023 --> 32:23.900
is that it's just...

32:23.900 --> 32:26.444
It's about World War II,
your war.

32:26.444 --> 32:27.946
It's gonna be, like,
out of this world.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.239
I'm shooting on a Bolex H8.

32:29.239 --> 32:30.699
Finally, I can use
double run film.

32:30.699 --> 32:31.908
You know, that's six minutes

32:31.908 --> 32:33.285
without having to
change the reel.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.453
How much did you spend
to rent this camera?

32:36.288 --> 32:38.290
- 20 bucks. But I used
my own money. -

32:38.290 --> 32:39.624
- You don't have to...

32:39.624 --> 32:41.835
And this movie editor
gizmo costs?

32:41.835 --> 32:44.379
It's a Mansfield
eight millimeter movie editor.

32:44.379 --> 32:46.548
How much?

32:46.548 --> 32:48.800
- 80 bucks.
- Doggone it, Sammy!

32:48.800 --> 32:51.136
A hundred dollars for a hobby?

32:51.136 --> 32:52.762
It's not a hobby, Dad.

32:52.762 --> 32:54.556
If you spent half the time
on algebra that you spend on

32:54.556 --> 32:56.516
- these movies, you could get...
- Algebra? I hate algebra.

32:56.516 --> 32:58.393
Why are you...

32:58.393 --> 32:59.978
It's completely pointless.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.022
Not if you want to make
something, it's not pointless.

33:02.022 --> 33:04.816
Gee, Sammy, when I was a boy,
I always used to think,

33:04.816 --> 33:07.110
-"Somebody figured out
how to make this." -Yeah.

33:07.110 --> 33:08.486
- This car...
- Uh-huh.

33:08.486 --> 33:10.864
...that rearview mirror,
that directional signal.

33:10.864 --> 33:12.949
I want to make movies, though.

33:12.949 --> 33:15.869
I mean something real.

33:15.869 --> 33:18.205
Not imaginary.

33:20.040 --> 33:22.667
Something someone can
actually use.

33:24.044 --> 33:26.880
Like a driver's license.

33:27.797 --> 33:30.217
I'm gonna vomit, Sammy!
I'm gonna vomit!

33:30.217 --> 33:31.509
Sammy, please pull over.

33:31.509 --> 33:33.053
She's gonna puke all over me.

33:33.053 --> 33:35.513
--Go slower.
You are the worst driver.

33:35.513 --> 33:37.224
You're gonna break the car.

33:37.224 --> 33:39.643
We're on a back road going
three miles per hour.

33:39.643 --> 33:41.853
- Calm down.
- You're doing great, doll.

33:41.853 --> 33:42.938
You're doing very well.

33:42.938 --> 33:44.606
Okay, watch out.
Puddle up ahead.

33:52.697 --> 33:54.616
- So we've got three

33:54.616 --> 33:56.534
that are strong and still green
inside, so they don't burn.

33:56.534 --> 33:58.578
Bright green means
that they're still alive

33:58.578 --> 34:00.538
and that they carry moisture.

34:00.538 --> 34:03.792
And the reason that we use
the shape of the triangle

34:03.792 --> 34:06.378
is that when
these three points connect,

34:06.378 --> 34:09.047
if we find the center
of gravitational force,

34:09.047 --> 34:11.383
it creates
almost perfect balance.

34:11.383 --> 34:13.343
- Whew. Oh. -Because I'm Tutti,
and you're Frutti.

34:13.343 --> 34:15.679
So who else
are you gonna listen to?

34:17.806 --> 34:19.099
Okay.

34:19.099 --> 34:20.058
- ...the pyramids, right?

34:21.393 --> 34:22.644
- Guys, come on!
- I mean, the history

34:22.644 --> 34:24.062
- behind this shape...

34:24.062 --> 34:26.231
- Ah. Oh!
- ...is pretty in--

34:26.231 --> 34:27.983
- is pretty incredible.

34:27.983 --> 34:30.026
Oh, hello!

34:30.026 --> 34:31.736
- Uh...
- Hi!

34:33.154 --> 34:34.739
Wait. Let me try it...

34:34.739 --> 34:37.075
- Let me try it like this.
- Okay, one more time.

34:37.075 --> 34:38.535
- Yeah, after one more time.
- Okay.

34:38.535 --> 34:40.036
-Ready?
- Hey.

34:40.036 --> 34:41.788
Girls, I'm gonna start the fire!

34:41.788 --> 34:45.166
- Three, two, one!
- Okay. Really big, really big!

34:45.166 --> 34:47.460
- Go! Whoa!

34:47.460 --> 34:49.045
I thought it was gonna break.

34:49.045 --> 34:50.463
Oh. It's-it's happening!

34:50.463 --> 34:52.215
You almost broke it in half.

35:49.981 --> 35:52.359
- Heart attack!

35:53.818 --> 35:56.029
- We'll take a schvitz
and have a... -

35:56.029 --> 35:57.280
- Shmitz.
- And eat some...

35:57.280 --> 35:58.698
Schnitzelpitz.

35:58.698 --> 36:00.700
- And drink slivovitz.
- And we'll lose our wits.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.577
- And we'll get the shits!
- And have...

36:02.577 --> 36:04.537
- Whoa!

36:06.539 --> 36:08.458
- -Wait.

36:10.543 --> 36:13.004
- Exactly!

36:24.641 --> 36:26.434
They're gonna know
that kind of FPU

36:26.434 --> 36:27.894
is not for
industrial process control,

36:27.894 --> 36:29.687
and it will raise
every red flag there is.

36:29.687 --> 36:31.689
- How many bits?
- Float64.

36:31.689 --> 36:33.024
64 bits?

36:33.024 --> 36:34.317
Sixty-- You are nuts.

36:34.317 --> 36:36.528
And time-sharing
for 11 operators?

36:36.528 --> 36:38.238
They're gonna know
this is a business machine

36:38.238 --> 36:40.865
- we're building, and we're
all gonna get fired. -

36:40.865 --> 36:42.325
No.

36:42.325 --> 36:43.618
Yes!

36:43.618 --> 36:45.203
GE doesn't build
business computers.

36:45.203 --> 36:46.538
We do heavy industry processing.

36:46.538 --> 36:47.956
You got that
straight from the CEO.

36:47.956 --> 36:49.707
Ralph Cordiner is gonna
skin you alive.

36:49.707 --> 36:52.627
Once Bank of America buys in,
this will be profitable,

36:52.627 --> 36:55.213
and that's Mr. Cordiner's job,
making money.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.548
My job is getting Raytheon

36:56.548 --> 36:59.217
to deliver
10,000 germanium transistors

36:59.217 --> 37:00.593
that meet
our tolerance standards.

37:00.593 --> 37:02.887
And your job is to get
the cabling diagrams

37:02.887 --> 37:04.806
to Pitney Bowes
so when the time comes,

37:04.806 --> 37:06.933
we have a sorter to hook up
to the mainframe.

37:06.933 --> 37:08.476
Well, maybe Pitney Bowes
will hire me

37:08.476 --> 37:09.561
after you get us both
canned from GE.

37:09.561 --> 37:11.229
Isn't it worth getting canned

37:11.229 --> 37:13.731
for the chance to build
a machine that can do all that?

37:13.731 --> 37:15.358
It's worth it to you, maybe!

37:15.358 --> 37:16.609
Sure as the Lord made
little green apples,

37:16.609 --> 37:18.194
California, here you come.

37:18.194 --> 37:19.571
IBM is waiting.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.072
Are we moving to California?

37:21.072 --> 37:22.490
- You are, any day now.
- No, no, no.

37:22.490 --> 37:24.033
What?

37:24.033 --> 37:25.618
IBM's asking,
and that's flattering, but...

37:25.618 --> 37:27.120
Flattering?
Flattering!

37:27.120 --> 37:29.122
Every guy in computer
would give his matzo balls

37:29.122 --> 37:30.582
to get an offer.

37:30.582 --> 37:32.125
You'll be in California

37:32.125 --> 37:34.752
building double-precision
auxiliary units with an FP64.

37:34.752 --> 37:37.088
I'm gonna be left
schvitzing in Arizona

37:37.088 --> 37:38.965
- making 40-watt light bulbs.
- Hold your horses.

37:38.965 --> 37:41.593
- Congruence? Come on. -I told
your mom it'll be up to her.

37:41.593 --> 37:44.345
I'm not uprooting us again
unless she says yes.

37:44.345 --> 37:49.893
Why would Mamaleh ever leave
all of this for California?

37:50.643 --> 37:53.188
- We have the Grand Canyon.

37:53.188 --> 37:56.274
They have the
San Andreas Fault.

37:57.317 --> 37:59.068
Mamaleh says...

37:59.068 --> 38:01.779
I will never leave Arizona,

38:01.779 --> 38:04.324
and Arizona will never leave me.

38:07.660 --> 38:10.455
Kids, avert your eyes.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.267
- Hey, man.
- Hmm?

38:31.267 --> 38:34.729
- Shouldn't you be filming this?
- Not enough light.

38:41.861 --> 38:45.698
GE, living better electrically!

39:04.926 --> 39:06.219
Mom?

39:06.219 --> 39:09.347
Mom, everyone can see
through your dress. Um...

39:12.517 --> 39:15.019
Reggie, get out of the way.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.398
Dad, can you please stop this?

39:19.190 --> 39:21.401
- Come. Sit.
- No.

39:24.988 --> 39:27.240
Bennie, don't look!

39:27.240 --> 39:29.659
- Oh! You're all nuts!

40:26.966 --> 40:29.761
My mama's such a good mama.

40:36.559 --> 40:38.728
I love you so much.

40:44.484 --> 40:46.653
I'm right here.

40:48.196 --> 40:50.531
I'm right here with you.

40:50.531 --> 40:52.617
I'm holding your hand.

40:52.617 --> 40:54.452
Can you feel that, Mama?

40:54.452 --> 40:56.162
I just gave you a squeeze.

40:57.747 --> 40:59.666
I love you, Mama.

41:03.503 --> 41:04.962
Ma.

41:06.381 --> 41:08.007
Mommy?

41:10.718 --> 41:12.303
She opened her eyes.

41:12.303 --> 41:14.555
Nurse.

41:14.555 --> 41:17.141
Mommy, I'm here.
Here. I'm right here.

41:17.141 --> 41:19.227
I'm right here, Mama.

41:20.228 --> 41:22.188
Mommy, look at me.

41:22.188 --> 41:24.232
Mommy, can you hear?

41:27.360 --> 41:28.820
Oh.

41:28.820 --> 41:32.740
Oh, oh...

42:01.018 --> 42:03.730
It's a Mansfield
eight millimeter movie editor.

42:03.730 --> 42:05.982
That's what you wanted, right?

42:10.695 --> 42:12.530
Oh, my God.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.540
Uh, now I need a favor
in return.

42:28.838 --> 42:31.007
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

42:31.007 --> 42:32.508
- Here's the favor.

42:32.508 --> 42:34.218
Yeah.

42:39.932 --> 42:42.268
I want you to make
a camping trip movie.

42:42.268 --> 42:43.770
Uh, you can learn

42:43.770 --> 42:45.021
how the editing machine works
while you do this.

42:45.021 --> 42:46.481
It'll make your mom feel better.

42:46.481 --> 42:48.149
Yeah.

42:48.149 --> 42:52.153
That last night when she danced
in the headlights,

42:52.153 --> 42:54.489
that'd be great.

42:54.489 --> 42:56.741
Get to it tomorrow, okay?

42:58.701 --> 43:02.747
Um, tomorrow's
when we start shooting.

43:05.082 --> 43:06.542
Escape to Nowhere.

43:06.542 --> 43:07.794
We're shooting all weekend, Dad.

43:07.794 --> 43:09.754
- I can't.
- Shoot it next weekend.

43:13.257 --> 43:15.593
We've got like 40 guys
coming to be in the movie.

43:15.593 --> 43:18.262
I'll-I'll w-work on all the
camping trip stuff on Monday.

43:18.262 --> 43:21.015
I'm asking you to do this now
for your mom. She's...

43:21.015 --> 43:23.935
Yeah, and I said that I will,
just not tomorrow, please.

43:23.935 --> 43:26.979
Don't be selfish.
She just lost her mother.

43:26.979 --> 43:29.148
That's more important
than your hobby.

43:29.148 --> 43:30.775
Dad, can you stop
calling it a hobby?

43:30.775 --> 43:32.985
It'll cheer her up,
watching this.

43:32.985 --> 43:35.029
- It's something we can do to...
- Her mom just died.

43:35.029 --> 43:36.906
How is that gonna cheer her up?

43:36.906 --> 43:39.617
Because you made it for her.

43:50.044 --> 43:52.964
Uh, something's not right.

43:55.925 --> 43:58.177
I don't know what else to do.

44:01.305 --> 44:03.307
Can you help me?

44:21.993 --> 44:23.327
Hello.

44:23.327 --> 44:26.664
Mitzi. Mitzi.

44:30.501 --> 44:32.336
Mama?

44:32.336 --> 44:34.422
Somebody's coming.

44:34.422 --> 44:36.173
Mama?

44:38.968 --> 44:41.596
M-Mama. What...

44:42.346 --> 44:44.932
- Mama. Mam...
- You mustn't let him in.

44:44.932 --> 44:49.270
- You mustn't let him in.
- Mama, I-I can't hear you.

44:49.270 --> 44:50.855
I am scared.

44:50.855 --> 44:53.858
You mustn't let him
in the house.

44:53.858 --> 44:55.276
Mama, please. I...

44:55.276 --> 44:56.694
Do not let him in.

44:56.694 --> 44:58.821
- Do not let him in the house.
- What? No, I can't--

44:58.821 --> 45:00.573
Wh-Who's coming?

45:00.573 --> 45:02.199
Don't open the door.

45:02.199 --> 45:03.868
Mama.

45:06.203 --> 45:07.455
Mommy, don't go.

45:07.455 --> 45:09.415
Don't go yet.

45:12.335 --> 45:15.421
-You're having
a bad dream. -

45:33.856 --> 45:37.276
- This is a lot of food, Mom.

45:37.276 --> 45:39.820
Well, I'm upset.

45:39.820 --> 45:42.073
Oh, my God. That crazy dream.

45:42.073 --> 45:44.241
I can't get it out of my head.

45:44.241 --> 45:48.079
Uh, last night, I dreamed
I got a call from my mama.

45:48.079 --> 45:50.247
And she wanted to warn me.

45:50.247 --> 45:53.000
- That's silly. Grandma died.
- About what?

45:53.000 --> 45:54.377
Well, something's coming.

45:54.377 --> 45:56.295
She wants me
to batten down the hatches.

45:56.295 --> 45:58.714
We're never going to be able
to eat all of this.

46:03.761 --> 46:05.179
Who is that?

46:16.732 --> 46:18.567
It's Uncle Boris.

46:18.567 --> 46:19.568
Hmm?

46:19.568 --> 46:21.237
Uncle who?

46:22.446 --> 46:24.115
Mom?

46:26.158 --> 46:28.828
That's who she meant!

46:30.913 --> 46:33.416
My--
That's my-my mama's brother!

46:38.713 --> 46:43.300
Oh, he scared the crap
out of her when they were kids!

46:50.975 --> 46:54.186
- Don't let him in!

46:57.690 --> 46:59.150
You were in the circus?

46:59.150 --> 47:00.860
Mama said you were
the lion tamer.

47:00.860 --> 47:02.445
No, not at first.

47:02.445 --> 47:06.449
At first, it was, "Podgorny,
pound in the tent pegs.

47:06.449 --> 47:09.452
Podgorny, muck out the
pachyderms."

47:09.452 --> 47:12.997
And then, one night,
the big cat act,

47:12.997 --> 47:15.499
he comes down with the flu bug,
so it was, uh,

47:15.499 --> 47:17.960
"Boris Podgorny,
in with the lions."

47:17.960 --> 47:19.670
- He's lying, right?

47:19.670 --> 47:22.840
- No, he's telling you a story.
- Know what it's like, huh?

47:22.840 --> 47:24.884
Pain in the ass, sisters.

47:26.177 --> 47:27.678
- That's rude.
- He said "ass"!

47:27.678 --> 47:29.096
I know.

47:29.096 --> 47:32.391
But when did you start
working in the movies?

47:32.391 --> 47:34.351
1927.

47:34.351 --> 47:35.936
1927-- that was The Jazz Singer.

47:35.936 --> 47:37.229
That's the year
that talkies started.

47:37.229 --> 47:39.023
Yeah, sure, talkies. But me, no.

47:39.023 --> 47:41.525
I started with, um,
Uncle Tom's Cabin.

47:41.525 --> 47:43.194
Not a talkie.

47:43.194 --> 47:45.696
It was Harry Pollard.

47:45.696 --> 47:47.323
He acted for Selig Polyscope.

47:47.323 --> 47:50.201
He, uh, married
Maggie what's-her-name.

47:50.201 --> 47:52.203
- Mm-hmm.
- He directed Uncle Tom.

47:52.203 --> 47:53.746
Lift up your plate.

47:53.746 --> 47:57.208
So, Pollard needed help
with the bloodhounds.

47:57.208 --> 48:00.753
So, my pal Fleischaker was
a big name in dog acts.

48:00.753 --> 48:02.213
- Poodles, mainly.

48:02.213 --> 48:05.466
But, "Sure,"
Fleischaker says to Pollard.

48:05.466 --> 48:08.094
"Yeah. Bloodhounds, poodles,
what's the difference?"

48:08.094 --> 48:09.553
Ooh.

48:09.553 --> 48:11.263
So, he went.

48:11.263 --> 48:15.226
But, uh, by this time,
uh, Fleischaker,

48:15.226 --> 48:17.436
he had it up to here
with the Jew-haters.

48:17.436 --> 48:21.023
There was a lot of that kind
in the circuses.

48:21.023 --> 48:22.983
Not many Jews,
lots of Jew-haters.

48:22.983 --> 48:24.819
- Right.
- But the movies...

48:24.819 --> 48:27.238
Oy vavoy!

48:27.238 --> 48:29.198
Fleischaker writes to me,
"Boris," he writes.

48:29.198 --> 48:31.408
"Boris," he writes,

48:31.408 --> 48:33.828
"Hollywood is heimish, heimishe.

48:33.828 --> 48:37.498
I'm in a minyan with Douglas
Fairbanks and Ricardo Cortez."

48:37.498 --> 48:38.707
- Whoa.
-"Come to Hollywood."

48:38.707 --> 48:40.084
So, I went.

48:42.419 --> 48:45.131
Your wife, she don't like
doing the dishes?

48:45.131 --> 48:47.967
Uh, piano hands.

48:47.967 --> 48:50.302
Ah, fershteyn.

48:51.095 --> 48:55.432
So, you like the movies,
huh, Mr. Pitselshas?

48:55.432 --> 48:58.435
Okay, so the sergeant,
he comes over the hill here,

48:58.435 --> 49:02.189
and I'm gonna go below him,
so we see him and the sky.

49:02.189 --> 49:03.858
And so we don't see
what he sees,

49:03.858 --> 49:05.568
but we do see that he's really--

49:05.568 --> 49:07.403
Okay, so he's, like,
almost losing his mind, right?

49:07.403 --> 49:09.613
- Mm-hmm. -'Cause what he is
seeing is totally terrible.

49:09.613 --> 49:12.449
And then, I'm gonna turn
the camera so that we see it.

49:12.449 --> 49:15.119
It's just in another notebook.
Hang on.

49:15.119 --> 49:17.288
If that's the movie, uh...

49:17.288 --> 49:19.665
you could show me instead of
describing me to death.

49:19.665 --> 49:21.917
No, that's just
our stupid camping trip.

49:21.917 --> 49:23.419
My dad's...

49:23.419 --> 49:25.296
He wants me to put
this camping film together

49:25.296 --> 49:26.463
so it'll cheer up Mom.

49:26.463 --> 49:29.800
Because her heart is broken.

49:29.800 --> 49:31.760
Because her mama iz toyt.

49:32.553 --> 49:35.264
But you, Mr. Director,
you don't want to do this,

49:35.264 --> 49:36.640
what your daddy tells you,

49:36.640 --> 49:39.018
because you want to make
your war picture, huh?

49:39.018 --> 49:41.145
Yeah, yeah.

49:41.145 --> 49:43.314
Believe me, Sammy boy, I get it.

49:43.314 --> 49:45.816
Family, art.

49:45.816 --> 49:48.402
It'll tear you in two.

49:51.113 --> 49:52.823
You hear that?

49:53.782 --> 49:55.326
Oh, yeah. My mom's practicing.
She's always...

49:55.326 --> 49:57.578
Sha. You talk too much. Listen.

50:03.334 --> 50:06.837
When she was a kid,
already she played like that.

50:07.838 --> 50:12.051
She should have been
a concert piano player.

50:12.051 --> 50:15.012
Little Rubinstein, she was.

50:15.846 --> 50:17.848
She could have played...

50:17.848 --> 50:21.518
You name it,
she could have played there.

50:21.518 --> 50:23.187
And she...

50:23.979 --> 50:27.566
Once, I visited her and Tina
and Menashe in Cincinnati,

50:27.566 --> 50:31.862
and she says to me she wants
to be a great piano artist.

50:31.862 --> 50:33.656
But she didn't do it.

50:33.656 --> 50:36.533
Yeah, she's really good.
You know, she played on TV.

50:36.533 --> 50:37.952
TV? Feh!

50:37.952 --> 50:41.455
She could have played
at Musikverein in Vienna.

50:42.456 --> 50:44.917
You see,
what she got in her heart

50:44.917 --> 50:46.710
is what you got, what I got.

50:46.710 --> 50:47.753
Art.

50:50.381 --> 50:52.216
Like me. Like you, I think.

50:52.216 --> 50:55.928
We're junkies,
and art is our drug.

50:55.928 --> 50:57.513
Family, we love.

50:57.513 --> 51:00.891
But art, we're meshuga for art.

51:00.891 --> 51:03.602
You think I wanted to leave my
sisters, my mama and my papa,

51:03.602 --> 51:06.855
and go stick my stupid head
in the mouth of lions?

51:07.648 --> 51:10.025
Put-Putting your head
in-in a lion's mouth is art?

51:13.070 --> 51:17.616
No. Sticking your head in
the mouths of lions was balls.

51:17.616 --> 51:22.246
Making sure the lion
don't eat my head, that is art.

51:23.247 --> 51:27.001
You see, Tini,
she didn't say to Mitzi,

51:27.001 --> 51:28.877
"Go do what you gotta."

51:28.877 --> 51:32.881
I mean, she was a good person,
my sister, but she was scared.

51:32.881 --> 51:34.425
Scared for your mother.

51:34.425 --> 51:36.302
- She should have safety
in the family. -Uh...

51:36.302 --> 51:38.595
So Mitzi, she gave it all up.

51:38.595 --> 51:41.181
Ow! Wh...

51:41.181 --> 51:43.267
I want you should remember
how that hurt.

51:43.267 --> 51:47.062
Because when they say all this,
when they say, "What you do?

51:47.062 --> 51:49.398
"Oh, that's cute. It's a hobby.

51:49.398 --> 51:51.317
It's like stamps
or butterfly collecting,"

51:51.317 --> 51:53.277
you feel your face,
how it feels now.

51:53.277 --> 51:54.528
Yeah, you almost pulled it off.

51:54.528 --> 51:55.946
So you remember your Uncle Boris

51:55.946 --> 51:57.489
and what he's telling you.

51:57.489 --> 51:59.992
Because you're going to join
the circus, I can tell.

51:59.992 --> 52:01.452
You can't hardly wait.

52:01.452 --> 52:02.953
You want to be in the big top.

52:02.953 --> 52:05.456
You'll shovel elephant shit
until they say,

52:05.456 --> 52:08.208
"Okay, Sammy,
now ride the goddamn elephant."

52:08.208 --> 52:09.877
Oh, you love those people, huh?

52:09.877 --> 52:12.838
Your sisters, your mama,
your papa. Except...

52:14.131 --> 52:15.883
Except this.

52:15.883 --> 52:17.760
This, I think you love
a little more.

52:17.760 --> 52:18.969
No, I don't.

52:18.969 --> 52:20.846
Yeah.

52:20.846 --> 52:23.015
Oh, hey.
Run all you want, boychick,

52:23.015 --> 52:25.476
but you know I ain't
whistling Dixie here.

52:25.476 --> 52:29.521
You'll make your movies,
and you will do your art.

52:29.521 --> 52:32.649
And you'll remember how it hurt.

52:32.649 --> 52:35.110
So you know what I'm saying?

52:35.110 --> 52:38.655
Art will give you crowns in
heaven and laurels on earth.

52:38.655 --> 52:40.449
But...

52:40.449 --> 52:44.661
it'll tear your heart out
and leave you lonely.

52:44.661 --> 52:47.164
You'll be a shanda
for your loved ones.

52:47.164 --> 52:49.208
An exile in the desert.

52:49.208 --> 52:50.876
A gypsy.

52:52.002 --> 52:53.754
Art is no game.

52:53.754 --> 52:55.547
Art is dangerous
as a lion's mouth.

52:55.547 --> 52:57.341
It'll bite your head off.

52:59.385 --> 53:00.844
Look at me.

53:02.179 --> 53:04.723
Look at me.

53:04.723 --> 53:08.519
Is it a wonder that Tini, she
wanted nothing to do with me?

53:08.519 --> 53:11.021
With me, with--

53:11.021 --> 53:13.232
Oh, Tini.

53:13.232 --> 53:17.194
Oh, Tini! Oh, Tini.

53:18.153 --> 53:19.321
I...

53:23.992 --> 53:25.786
Stop, stop! Stop it!

53:25.786 --> 53:29.373
What, you never saw
nobody grieving before?

53:33.794 --> 53:36.380
Let's go to sleep, bubbala.

53:43.846 --> 53:46.181
Uh, you can sleep in the bed.
I have my sleeping bag.

53:46.181 --> 53:47.558
I'm sitting shiva for my sister.

53:47.558 --> 53:48.976
I sleep on the floor.

53:48.976 --> 53:50.602
Y-You want to sleep
on the floor, too?

53:50.602 --> 53:52.938
- She was your grandma.

53:52.938 --> 53:56.066
Tear your clothes.
Sleep on the floor.

53:56.066 --> 53:58.277
Good night.

54:11.498 --> 54:13.917
- Say "bye-bye."
- Bye-bye.

54:13.917 --> 54:15.085
Bye-bye.

54:59.630 --> 55:02.382
I don't know what Mama
was so worried about.

55:02.382 --> 55:05.636
It was a nice visit.

1:01:03.326 --> 1:01:04.369
Yuck.

1:01:13.295 --> 1:01:15.255
- Whoa!

1:01:15.255 --> 1:01:17.757
- Oh!

1:01:22.512 --> 1:01:25.307
Aw.

1:01:27.475 --> 1:01:31.229
This is the life.

1:01:41.406 --> 1:01:44.743
Only you can prevent
forest fires.

1:02:12.729 --> 1:02:14.397
Mm.

1:02:24.824 --> 1:02:27.327
Oh.

1:02:29.955 --> 1:02:33.959
It's so beautiful,
what you made, dolly.

1:02:34.751 --> 1:02:37.170
You really see me.

1:02:44.427 --> 1:02:46.304
Hey, man. How about that, huh?

1:02:46.304 --> 1:02:49.265
Hey, Sammy, that was real neat.

1:02:53.436 --> 1:02:54.896
Die, Amerikaner!

1:02:56.189 --> 1:02:58.984
Move! Move! Fall backwards!

1:03:03.113 --> 1:03:04.906
Whoa!

1:03:05.699 --> 1:03:06.950
Attacke!

1:03:09.661 --> 1:03:10.954
- Ah! Cover!

1:03:18.128 --> 1:03:20.130
Krauts, they're everywhere!

1:03:21.715 --> 1:03:23.466
There's too many of them!

1:03:46.448 --> 1:03:48.324
Turn.

1:03:48.324 --> 1:03:49.367
Cut!

1:03:49.367 --> 1:03:52.162
Great. Now, um...

1:03:53.580 --> 1:03:55.123
Okay, come here. Come here.

1:03:55.123 --> 1:03:58.001
Um, you're standing here
a minute,

1:03:58.001 --> 1:04:00.003
looking down
at what just happened.

1:04:00.003 --> 1:04:02.130
- A whole minute?
- I'll give you a signal

1:04:02.130 --> 1:04:03.923
when I want you to start
to move, okay? So you're just...

1:04:03.923 --> 1:04:05.550
Like, you mean
I should count to 60?

1:04:05.550 --> 1:04:07.010
- What? No. No, no, no, no.
- Like, one Mississippi,

1:04:07.010 --> 1:04:08.011
two Mississippi, and then move?

1:04:08.011 --> 1:04:09.179
Don't-don't count to 60.

1:04:09.179 --> 1:04:11.431
You just got to...

1:04:11.431 --> 1:04:14.434
S-S-So... So you're all
like-like-like,

1:04:14.434 --> 1:04:16.019
"Oh, my God."

1:04:16.019 --> 1:04:20.231
Like, "All my men,
they're all...

1:04:20.231 --> 1:04:22.192
they're all dead.
All my men, they're-they're..."

1:04:22.192 --> 1:04:25.445
So you want me to,
like, act and stuff.

1:04:25.445 --> 1:04:27.030
Well... yeah.

1:04:27.030 --> 1:04:28.698
- Like I'm-I'm sort of sad
or something? -Right.

1:04:28.698 --> 1:04:30.742
- Um, that's the whole point.
-'Cause my whole platoon...

1:04:30.742 --> 1:04:32.118
R-Right, right. Your platoon.

1:04:32.118 --> 1:04:34.746
Your... Your men!

1:04:34.746 --> 1:04:37.707
They've been wiped out.

1:04:37.707 --> 1:04:40.627
These guys, they're your family.

1:04:42.045 --> 1:04:43.713
Your family's being,

1:04:43.713 --> 1:04:45.882
- like, murdered,

1:04:45.882 --> 1:04:47.801
and it's your fault.

1:04:47.801 --> 1:04:49.969
You did this to them, and you...

1:04:49.969 --> 1:04:51.471
I-I thought it was
the Nazis that...

1:04:51.471 --> 1:04:53.389
Okay, yeah, but it was you
who gave the order

1:04:53.389 --> 1:04:55.141
to go down into
the Valley of Death.

1:04:55.141 --> 1:04:56.392
- Okay? You decided.
- Mm-hmm.

1:04:56.392 --> 1:04:58.561
Nobody else. You could've...

1:04:58.561 --> 1:05:00.438
Mm-hmm.

1:05:00.438 --> 1:05:02.690
You could've protected them.
Okay?

1:05:02.690 --> 1:05:06.486
'Cause they trusted you,
and they loved you.

1:05:06.486 --> 1:05:07.570
Mm-hmm.

1:05:07.570 --> 1:05:13.076
Now you're just looking
at this...

1:05:14.953 --> 1:05:18.957
...at this thing
that you've done,

1:05:18.957 --> 1:05:23.336
and... you can't
save them anymore.

1:05:23.336 --> 1:05:26.089
Because they're all dead.

1:05:27.423 --> 1:05:29.634
- Wow, that's, uh...
- Yeah.

1:05:30.969 --> 1:05:32.595
...real gung ho.

1:05:34.097 --> 1:05:36.266
Okay. Okay.

1:05:36.266 --> 1:05:37.934
- You good?
- Lock and load.

1:05:37.934 --> 1:05:39.602
Yeah. Yeah. Lock and load.
All right.

1:05:39.602 --> 1:05:41.104
Good.

1:06:37.619 --> 1:06:39.412
Uh, Sammy?

1:06:39.412 --> 1:06:42.040
How far are you
gonna let him walk?

1:06:44.042 --> 1:06:45.376
Cut!

1:06:50.465 --> 1:06:52.383
Hey, that's a cut, Angelo!

1:06:52.383 --> 1:06:54.469
- Angelo!
- Angelo!

1:06:54.469 --> 1:06:55.720
Come back! Come back!

1:06:55.720 --> 1:06:58.014
- He said, "Cut!"
- Angelo, hey! -Angelo!

1:09:07.477 --> 1:09:09.729
- Bravo!

1:09:11.522 --> 1:09:13.316
Bravo!

1:09:20.990 --> 1:09:22.367
Sammy!

1:09:25.620 --> 1:09:29.415
Oh, dolly!

1:09:29.415 --> 1:09:32.460
You're not a civilian anymore.

1:09:32.460 --> 1:09:34.837
That movie, my God.

1:09:34.837 --> 1:09:36.881
It was...

1:09:38.174 --> 1:09:39.550
Hi, Mrs. Fabelman.

1:09:47.725 --> 1:09:49.143
Mr. DeMille.

1:09:49.143 --> 1:09:50.686
Come here.

1:09:51.854 --> 1:09:54.190
- Hey, there he is.
- Congratulations, young man.

1:09:54.190 --> 1:09:55.733
- Congratulations.
- Hey. Hey, hey.

1:09:55.733 --> 1:09:57.485
I guess you based it on
your dad's war stories, huh?

1:09:57.485 --> 1:09:58.986
Sort of.
You know, but he doesn't like

1:09:58.986 --> 1:10:00.696
- to talk about it, so...
- No, I understand.

1:10:00.696 --> 1:10:01.948
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1:10:01.948 --> 1:10:04.075
Dad, Mom's getting a ride
with Bennie.

1:10:04.075 --> 1:10:05.368
She'll see us at home.

1:10:05.368 --> 1:10:06.702
Hey, that last scene with the...

1:10:06.702 --> 1:10:08.287
Why do you like blood so much?

1:10:08.287 --> 1:10:09.372
And are you ever
gonna make a movie

1:10:09.372 --> 1:10:10.915
with parts for girls again?

1:10:10.915 --> 1:10:12.625
- Yeah.
- Make a career...

1:10:12.625 --> 1:10:14.377
- With girls,
you know, like,

1:10:14.377 --> 1:10:17.046
because all the men stare off
into the distance all the time,

1:10:17.046 --> 1:10:18.923
maybe a girl could save the day.

1:10:20.550 --> 1:10:23.052
Okay, what are the five steps
to save a drowning person?

1:10:23.052 --> 1:10:25.179
All right, one is
you swim behind the person

1:10:25.179 --> 1:10:26.514
so they don't grab you.

1:10:26.514 --> 1:10:28.724
Two, you throw your arm
across his chest.

1:10:28.724 --> 1:10:30.393
- Or her chest.
- Three.

1:10:30.393 --> 1:10:32.311
Not Sammy. He's too scared
of girls' boobies.

1:10:32.311 --> 1:10:34.522
--Three, you swim
on your back with the victim

1:10:34.522 --> 1:10:36.566
on your chest, using your
free arm to paddle yourself.

1:10:36.566 --> 1:10:38.526
And speaking of boobies,
if you ever get any,

1:10:38.526 --> 1:10:39.986
we'll have a party. Um...

1:10:39.986 --> 1:10:41.571
And at the party,
we'll give her the booby prize.

1:10:41.571 --> 1:10:44.365
- Ha-ha. What's four?

1:10:44.365 --> 1:10:45.908
Um...

1:10:48.244 --> 1:10:49.662
- Crap.

1:10:49.662 --> 1:10:51.289
Bring the victim to land, dummy.

1:10:51.289 --> 1:10:53.416
- Mm.
- Then five?

1:10:53.416 --> 1:10:56.794
Call the undertaker.

1:11:00.173 --> 1:11:01.883
This is serious business.

1:11:01.883 --> 1:11:04.051
I got to know all of this to
get the lifesaving merit badge.

1:11:04.051 --> 1:11:06.762
More kids die
in swimming accidents

1:11:06.762 --> 1:11:08.264
than in any other kind
of accident.

1:11:08.264 --> 1:11:09.432
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1:11:09.432 --> 1:11:10.933
Not everything is a big joke.

1:11:10.933 --> 1:11:13.269
Okay, okay.
So what's step number five?

1:11:13.269 --> 1:11:15.271
It's just--
You laugh at everything,

1:11:15.271 --> 1:11:16.647
even when nothing's funny.

1:11:16.647 --> 1:11:18.399
You always have to be
the center of attention.

1:11:18.399 --> 1:11:22.069
Eat. And don't talk
with your mouth full.

1:11:22.069 --> 1:11:25.239
I'm not eating this crud
before a swimming test.

1:11:25.239 --> 1:11:27.575
You can get cramps in the water
if you eat before,

1:11:27.575 --> 1:11:29.452
and you can drown
from getting cramps!

1:11:29.452 --> 1:11:30.703
Stop shouting at her!

1:11:30.703 --> 1:11:33.122
Sammy Fabelman, goddamn it!

1:11:33.122 --> 1:11:34.457
For weeks now,

1:11:34.457 --> 1:11:36.792
it has been nothing
but disrespect from you!

1:11:36.792 --> 1:11:38.002
Disrespect?!

1:11:38.002 --> 1:11:40.254
Why are you being
such a little shit to me?!

1:11:40.254 --> 1:11:41.672
Damn it to hell,
I am your mother!

1:11:41.672 --> 1:11:43.966
I wish you weren't!

1:12:07.323 --> 1:12:11.118
Oh. Let me see.

1:12:11.118 --> 1:12:13.120
Oh, my God.

1:12:13.120 --> 1:12:14.330
Oh, what have I done?

1:12:20.169 --> 1:12:21.712
Talk to me.

1:12:22.588 --> 1:12:24.590
Oh, Sammy, please talk to me.

1:12:24.590 --> 1:12:26.133
Tell me what's happening.

1:12:26.133 --> 1:12:31.055
Do you have any idea
how much I love you?

1:12:40.147 --> 1:12:42.024
Don't go.

1:15:24.478 --> 1:15:25.855
Mom.

1:15:26.856 --> 1:15:28.190
Mom.

1:15:30.609 --> 1:15:32.278
I won't tell.

1:15:34.363 --> 1:15:36.615
I won't tell. I won't.

1:15:37.908 --> 1:15:40.327
- I won't tell.

1:15:40.327 --> 1:15:41.871
I won't.

1:16:02.767 --> 1:16:04.727
Sure about this?

1:16:06.103 --> 1:16:07.688
Mm-hmm.

1:16:09.690 --> 1:16:12.026
There you go.
Bought and paid for.

1:16:12.026 --> 1:16:14.695
Oh. Just a second.
It's in the back.

1:16:18.407 --> 1:16:20.701
Stocking up on Kodak
before the big move?

1:16:20.701 --> 1:16:22.161
N-No, I'm...

1:16:22.161 --> 1:16:24.288
Smart. Film's cheaper here
than in California.

1:16:24.288 --> 1:16:27.249
I bet everything's
more expensive there.

1:16:27.249 --> 1:16:28.918
You're losing
your steadiest customer.

1:16:28.918 --> 1:16:33.589
Him and his whole family,
they're moving west.

1:16:33.589 --> 1:16:35.674
He just sold me his camera.

1:16:35.674 --> 1:16:37.927
Oh, yeah? How come?

1:16:37.927 --> 1:16:39.428
Says he's finished.

1:16:39.428 --> 1:16:41.639
Sorry about the wait, Mr. Loewy.

1:16:41.639 --> 1:16:43.599
We had to order it special.

1:16:43.599 --> 1:16:45.142
You bought a camera?

1:16:48.646 --> 1:16:50.439
It's for you!

1:16:50.439 --> 1:16:52.817
I know how much you loved
using it for your war picture,

1:16:52.817 --> 1:16:54.443
so I figured you ought to have
one of your own.

1:16:54.443 --> 1:16:59.281
It's, um, a "bon voyage,"
"see you later, alligator,"

1:16:59.281 --> 1:17:02.868
"I believe in you" present
from your uncle Bennie.

1:17:13.671 --> 1:17:15.923
Because it's from me?

1:17:17.716 --> 1:17:20.052
This move? Huh?

1:17:20.052 --> 1:17:23.097
This is your dad's
glory-hallelujah moment.

1:17:23.097 --> 1:17:26.684
And, oy vavoy, Sammy,
does that guy ever deserve it.

1:17:26.684 --> 1:17:28.352
All the way back when,
back at RCA,

1:17:28.352 --> 1:17:30.020
he knew what computing
was gonna be about

1:17:30.020 --> 1:17:32.481
before practically
anybody else knew it.

1:17:34.066 --> 1:17:36.277
And IBM?

1:17:36.277 --> 1:17:38.237
That's where guys like Burt
are figuring out

1:17:38.237 --> 1:17:40.990
how to use what he's made to...

1:17:40.990 --> 1:17:43.033
They're gonna change
the whole goddamn world,

1:17:43.033 --> 1:17:45.411
so this was the right decision.

1:17:48.831 --> 1:17:51.041
For all sorts of reasons.

1:17:54.003 --> 1:17:57.339
Yeah, so I'm happy for you.

1:17:57.339 --> 1:17:59.425
You know I am.

1:17:59.425 --> 1:18:01.135
But I'm gonna miss you.

1:18:01.927 --> 1:18:04.179
All of you, a lot.

1:18:11.228 --> 1:18:13.731
You think whatever bad things
you want about me, kiddo,

1:18:13.731 --> 1:18:15.024
but you stop making movies,

1:18:15.024 --> 1:18:17.818
it'll break your mother's heart.

1:18:17.818 --> 1:18:20.321
You will break her heart,
I mean it.

1:18:21.405 --> 1:18:23.616
She doesn't deserve that,
not from anybody,

1:18:23.616 --> 1:18:26.035
least of all from you.

1:18:39.089 --> 1:18:41.717
I'll give you 35 bucks for it.

1:18:42.509 --> 1:18:44.720
You drive a hard bargain, kid.

1:19:01.904 --> 1:19:04.114
I'm still done
making movies, though.

1:19:04.907 --> 1:19:07.743
Everybody makes movies
in California.

1:19:16.335 --> 1:19:17.336
Hey!

1:19:17.336 --> 1:19:19.129
Keep the change.

1:19:32.977 --> 1:19:34.853
When will the new house
be finished?

1:19:34.853 --> 1:19:37.773
A few months, in the spring.

1:19:37.773 --> 1:19:39.608
Can I have my own room?

1:19:39.608 --> 1:19:42.069
Everybody gets their own room.

1:19:42.069 --> 1:19:44.279
- Yay!
- Yes!

1:19:50.494 --> 1:19:53.038
I just remembered, last night,
I had a funny dream.

1:19:53.038 --> 1:19:54.790
What was it?

1:19:54.790 --> 1:19:57.251
I-I can't believe
I dreamed this.

1:19:57.251 --> 1:20:00.129
Uh, uh, uh, Bennie and me
were having an argument,

1:20:00.129 --> 1:20:04.133
and I hauled off and socked him
right in the nose.

1:20:17.062 --> 1:20:18.772
What's wrong?

1:20:18.772 --> 1:20:20.107
Is Mommy carsick?

1:20:20.107 --> 1:20:22.359
Let's just give her
a little time.

1:20:45.382 --> 1:20:48.510
Bennie and me, we never...

1:20:48.510 --> 1:20:50.637
we never...

1:20:53.849 --> 1:20:56.560
I would never let it get
as far as I imagine you think.

1:20:56.560 --> 1:20:59.938
Oh, I never
imagined any of that.

1:20:59.938 --> 1:21:02.691
You think Dad knows?

1:21:02.691 --> 1:21:04.109
I don't... I don't mean...

1:21:04.109 --> 1:21:05.652
I don't mean,
"Did you tell him?"

1:21:05.652 --> 1:21:07.029
I know you didn't.

1:21:07.821 --> 1:21:09.573
But...

1:21:13.994 --> 1:21:16.538
But you think he has an inkling?

1:21:20.334 --> 1:21:22.336
I've almost told him
so many times.

1:21:22.336 --> 1:21:24.713
I'll say,
"Burt, there's something

1:21:24.713 --> 1:21:27.216
I've got to tell you."

1:21:27.216 --> 1:21:29.218
Then he looks at me
like he can't conceive

1:21:29.218 --> 1:21:30.969
that anything
could be wrong between us,

1:21:30.969 --> 1:21:33.555
so instead, I say,
"Burt, we got ants."

1:21:35.557 --> 1:21:37.351
Or, "Burt, could you climb
on the roof

1:21:37.351 --> 1:21:39.394
and turn the antenna
so I can watch channel 5?"

1:21:39.394 --> 1:21:41.939
Which, of course, he does.

1:21:46.485 --> 1:21:49.321
I can't fight with your father.

1:21:51.281 --> 1:21:54.118
He kills with such kindness.

1:21:55.911 --> 1:21:57.871
I'm mean to him,
he buys me a dress.

1:21:57.871 --> 1:22:00.666
From Saks.

1:22:03.544 --> 1:22:05.462
Mom, when I showed you
what I filmed,

1:22:05.462 --> 1:22:07.673
I never meant
for any of this to happen.

1:22:07.673 --> 1:22:09.675
Oh... mmm.

1:22:12.219 --> 1:22:14.596
Guilt is a wasted emotion.

1:22:15.931 --> 1:22:17.432
Hmm.

1:22:20.602 --> 1:22:23.438
What's gonna happen now?

1:22:26.817 --> 1:22:28.819
I'm gonna be your mom.

1:22:28.819 --> 1:22:32.406
I'm gonna be the girls' mom.

1:22:32.406 --> 1:22:34.283
Despite my countless faults,

1:22:34.283 --> 1:22:36.743
I'm not ruining everything
for everyone.

1:22:36.743 --> 1:22:38.954
I'm gonna not be selfish.

1:22:41.498 --> 1:22:44.918
Burt Fabelman is the kindest,
smartest, wisest,

1:22:44.918 --> 1:22:47.462
most patient, most decent,

1:22:47.462 --> 1:22:49.590
most understanding man there is,

1:22:49.590 --> 1:22:52.551
and I'm gonna stay married
to him.

1:23:15.157 --> 1:23:17.326
It's only a rental.

1:23:17.326 --> 1:23:18.702
The new house will be ready

1:23:18.702 --> 1:23:20.913
faster than you can say
"Jack Robinson."

1:23:20.913 --> 1:23:23.165
Jack Robinson.

1:23:25.042 --> 1:23:27.169
And we're still here.

1:23:28.670 --> 1:23:30.005
Just tell me if
you're going to mope

1:23:30.005 --> 1:23:31.381
for the rest of your life

1:23:31.381 --> 1:23:32.633
or if it's something
you plan to outgrow.

1:23:32.633 --> 1:23:33.967
Bug off.

1:23:33.967 --> 1:23:35.761
You're, like, going for
the misery merit badge,

1:23:35.761 --> 1:23:37.554
you and Mom
with your long faces.

1:23:37.554 --> 1:23:39.848
She can't even get out of bed
to make breakfast and...

1:23:39.848 --> 1:23:41.266
Okay, new rule, guys.

1:23:41.266 --> 1:23:43.101
Um, when we walk to school
in the morning,

1:23:43.101 --> 1:23:45.312
let's just leave
all the Fabelman mishegoss

1:23:45.312 --> 1:23:47.439
behind us in the Fabelmans'
moldy old rental house.

1:23:47.439 --> 1:23:49.733
So, for eight hours a day,
let's be normal kids

1:23:49.733 --> 1:23:51.860
in an ordinary,
normal school, okay?

1:23:53.278 --> 1:23:54.863
Some glue
on your hand or something.

1:23:56.198 --> 1:23:57.950
- Too easy.
- That's what I'm telling you.

1:23:57.950 --> 1:24:00.535
It's like we got parachuted

1:24:00.535 --> 1:24:03.747
into the land of
the giant sequoia people.

1:24:03.747 --> 1:24:05.707
All right.

1:24:05.707 --> 1:24:08.794
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

1:24:11.171 --> 1:24:12.798
- Up over! Nice dig.

1:24:12.798 --> 1:24:14.216
Atta Johnson.

1:24:14.216 --> 1:24:16.927
- I got it. I got it.
- Get it up. Get it up.

1:24:16.927 --> 1:24:18.929
- Oh!
- Set, set, set, set.

1:24:18.929 --> 1:24:20.555
- Hit it.
- Take it.

1:24:20.555 --> 1:24:21.890
I got it.

1:24:21.890 --> 1:24:24.476
Way to get up!

1:24:24.476 --> 1:24:26.853
- Nice.

1:24:27.896 --> 1:24:31.024
Nice. Attababy, Logan.

1:24:33.026 --> 1:24:34.569
Do it again. Go again.

1:24:34.569 --> 1:24:37.197
- Come on, boys.

1:24:37.197 --> 1:24:39.074
- Good work, guys.

1:24:39.074 --> 1:24:41.076
Keep the intensity. Keep moving.

1:24:42.995 --> 1:24:44.788
Rotate. Nice, Jake.

1:24:44.788 --> 1:24:46.498
Good job, Chris.

1:24:48.041 --> 1:24:49.543
Fabelman, it won't hurt you.

1:24:49.543 --> 1:24:51.128
It's a volleyball,
not a cannonball.

1:24:51.128 --> 1:24:53.964
- Okay. Let's go. Serve.

1:24:53.964 --> 1:24:55.549
Go!

1:24:55.549 --> 1:24:56.758
Attababy!

1:24:56.758 --> 1:24:57.968
That's good reactions.

1:24:57.968 --> 1:24:59.219
Let's move. Let's...

1:25:01.305 --> 1:25:03.724
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.
I didn't... Oh, my...

1:25:03.724 --> 1:25:06.226
I'm gonna murder you,
you piece of shit!

1:25:06.226 --> 1:25:08.103
Hey, Chad.

1:25:09.855 --> 1:25:11.315
Cool it.

1:25:12.107 --> 1:25:13.775
I am... I did not mean
to do that.

1:25:13.775 --> 1:25:15.944
- Are you okay? I'm...
- That really hurt, asshole.

1:25:15.944 --> 1:25:18.113
Watch your mouth, Logan.

1:25:23.327 --> 1:25:25.495
Go fetch the ball.

1:25:26.663 --> 1:25:28.123
Sure, yeah.

1:25:29.041 --> 1:25:31.626
- Let's go.
- Mm-hmm.

1:25:33.920 --> 1:25:36.131
Hey, new kid.

1:25:36.131 --> 1:25:38.133
What's your name?

1:25:40.093 --> 1:25:42.054
Sam.

1:25:42.054 --> 1:25:44.473
Sam what?

1:25:47.559 --> 1:25:49.436
Fabelman.

1:25:51.938 --> 1:25:53.899
Told you he's a kike.

1:25:53.899 --> 1:25:55.650
He doesn't like Jews.

1:25:55.650 --> 1:25:58.320
Nobody likes Jews.

1:25:58.320 --> 1:26:01.198
Except other Jews, right?

1:26:02.324 --> 1:26:04.826
So, Bagelman...

1:26:04.826 --> 1:26:06.370
No, that's not my name.

1:26:06.370 --> 1:26:08.163
- Don't call me that.
- So...

1:26:08.163 --> 1:26:10.415
you gave my best friend
a concussion, Bagelman.

1:26:10.415 --> 1:26:13.043
- No, I didn't. Leave me alone.
- Hey.

1:26:13.043 --> 1:26:15.170
Don't argue with me.

1:26:15.170 --> 1:26:17.506
A serious concussion.

1:26:18.590 --> 1:26:20.884
So, how do we make you pay?

1:26:22.094 --> 1:26:23.428
How about this? We...

1:26:23.428 --> 1:26:25.013
You're drinking
from the fountain.

1:26:25.013 --> 1:26:28.308
You never hear me come up
from behind you, and bam!

1:26:28.308 --> 1:26:31.770
- I shatter your front teeth
all over the spigot. -

1:26:34.356 --> 1:26:36.066
Hey, look at me.

1:26:38.193 --> 1:26:41.321
He's demented, like, medically.

1:26:42.197 --> 1:26:44.199
So watch out for yourself.

1:27:07.722 --> 1:27:09.891
- Close the door!

1:27:15.730 --> 1:27:18.400
- Mom got a monkey.
- Why'd you get a monkey?

1:27:18.400 --> 1:27:19.818
'Cause I needed to laugh.

1:27:23.071 --> 1:27:24.656
- Oh, help me with this.

1:27:24.656 --> 1:27:26.741
The directions don't make
any sense.

1:27:26.741 --> 1:27:28.618
Careful. Careful.

1:27:28.618 --> 1:27:30.662
Get down!

1:27:31.455 --> 1:27:33.707
I'll get a banana.

1:27:33.707 --> 1:27:36.293
Save the curtains.
They're rented.

1:27:43.925 --> 1:27:45.594
Oh.

1:27:46.845 --> 1:27:48.180
Uh, hello.

1:27:48.180 --> 1:27:49.848
Who are you?

1:27:49.848 --> 1:27:51.516
He's mine.

1:27:51.516 --> 1:27:53.685
What are we gonna call him?

1:27:54.478 --> 1:27:57.189
Bennie. His name's Bennie.

1:28:03.862 --> 1:28:06.239
I don't want to see
a psychiatrist, Burt.

1:28:06.239 --> 1:28:07.532
You're scaring the kids.

1:28:07.532 --> 1:28:08.742
You're sleeping all day.

1:28:08.742 --> 1:28:10.452
I miss the desert.

1:28:10.452 --> 1:28:12.037
I miss dry heat.

1:28:12.037 --> 1:28:13.914
You haven't even unwrapped
the piano.

1:28:13.914 --> 1:28:16.917
You aren't cooking
or shopping or unpacking.

1:28:16.917 --> 1:28:18.668
Psychiatrists help you know

1:28:18.668 --> 1:28:20.629
why you're feeling something.

1:28:20.629 --> 1:28:22.464
They can't help you feel
something different.

1:28:22.464 --> 1:28:24.466
You're behaving
like when your mother died,

1:28:24.466 --> 1:28:27.844
like you're in mourning,
but nobody's died.

1:28:30.013 --> 1:28:31.556
Okay.

1:28:32.474 --> 1:28:35.560
So I'll call the monkey
some other name.

1:28:48.657 --> 1:28:51.576
IBM's out of his league, Mitz.

1:28:53.036 --> 1:28:56.039
Bennie was... He...

1:28:56.039 --> 1:28:59.543
is my best friend.

1:28:59.543 --> 1:29:01.545
But they don't need him.

1:29:01.545 --> 1:29:03.672
This is what I know.

1:29:05.465 --> 1:29:07.592
I don't need him, either.

1:29:09.719 --> 1:29:12.347
Bennie wasn't your friend.

1:29:13.306 --> 1:29:15.892
But you knew he was mine.

1:29:18.103 --> 1:29:20.355
What does that mean?

1:30:16.703 --> 1:30:19.414
Logan, I'm really,
really missing you.

1:30:23.293 --> 1:30:24.836
- Hey!

1:30:24.836 --> 1:30:26.630
- Who's there?

1:30:26.630 --> 1:30:28.882
Who's there?

1:30:40.185 --> 1:30:42.604
Bagelman, yo.

1:30:54.115 --> 1:30:56.368
I left you a little snack
in your locker.

1:30:56.368 --> 1:30:58.453
Did you like it?

1:30:58.453 --> 1:30:59.829
Guess he wasn't hungry.

1:30:59.829 --> 1:31:01.831
Uh, he said... he said it was...

1:31:01.831 --> 1:31:03.792
- What'd you call it, Chad?
- Kosher.

1:31:03.792 --> 1:31:06.211
- Kosher.
- Knock it off, moron!

1:31:06.211 --> 1:31:09.005
We talked about this.

1:31:09.005 --> 1:31:10.799
All right.

1:31:10.799 --> 1:31:13.176
Come on.
We'll be late for practice.

1:31:15.720 --> 1:31:18.515
So, what is this?
Are you Jewish?

1:31:21.518 --> 1:31:22.977
Well...

1:31:22.977 --> 1:31:24.813
Holy crap.
He's got the hots so bad,

1:31:24.813 --> 1:31:26.481
he can't even talk to her.

1:31:26.481 --> 1:31:29.025
No, I don't.

1:31:29.025 --> 1:31:31.236
Apologize to her.

1:31:31.236 --> 1:31:33.321
For what?

1:31:33.321 --> 1:31:36.199
For making goo-goo eyes at her,
for drooling at her.

1:31:36.199 --> 1:31:38.326
I wasn't drooling at her.

1:31:38.326 --> 1:31:41.329
Then apologize to her
for killing Christ.

1:31:41.329 --> 1:31:44.582
- Why are you encouraging him?

1:31:45.583 --> 1:31:46.918
Go on.

1:31:46.918 --> 1:31:50.171
Apologize to her
for killing our Lord.

1:31:51.506 --> 1:31:53.967
Ugh. Don't go.

1:31:53.967 --> 1:31:55.760
- Come watch me run.
- No, thanks.

1:31:55.760 --> 1:31:57.345
- I'm not in the mood now.
- Oh, please.

1:31:57.345 --> 1:31:58.888
I run better when you are there.

1:31:58.888 --> 1:32:01.558
Apologize to her, you
Christ-killing son of a bitch!

1:32:01.558 --> 1:32:03.518
I'm going home.

1:32:05.437 --> 1:32:07.230
Go on and say sorry.

1:32:07.230 --> 1:32:10.024
You're getting me in trouble
with my girl.

1:32:10.024 --> 1:32:12.861
You know, obviously,
since I'm not 2,000 years old

1:32:12.861 --> 1:32:16.030
and have never been to Rome,
I'm not apologizing.

1:32:16.030 --> 1:32:18.867
But hey, you know, maybe, uh,
your boyfriend should

1:32:18.867 --> 1:32:21.119
apologize to you
for making out in the stairwell

1:32:21.119 --> 1:32:23.830
half an hour ago
with some redhead.

1:32:23.830 --> 1:32:26.207
He-he's lying. He's...
I-I didn't do that.

1:32:26.207 --> 1:32:27.375
I swear.

1:32:27.375 --> 1:32:29.210
You told me
you were finished with her.

1:32:30.628 --> 1:32:33.965
Logan, you lied to me!

1:32:36.259 --> 1:32:37.594
Claudia.

1:32:40.972 --> 1:32:43.892
Whoa...

1:32:46.895 --> 1:32:48.855
You made a mistake.
Listen to me.

1:32:48.855 --> 1:32:50.231
- You made a mistake.

1:32:50.231 --> 1:32:51.733
- You're gonna fix it.
- Bash his head in!

1:32:51.733 --> 1:32:53.401
Shut up, Chad, goddamn it!

1:32:53.401 --> 1:32:55.695
Tomorrow, you're gonna
find her first thing,

1:32:55.695 --> 1:32:57.405
and you're gonna tell her
you were lying.

1:32:57.405 --> 1:32:58.907
Say-say you were, um, scared.

1:32:58.907 --> 1:33:00.492
Say-say whatever you
got to say, but you tell her

1:33:00.492 --> 1:33:03.411
it wasn't true and you did not
see me doing that.

1:33:03.411 --> 1:33:05.747
Or I swear, I will hurt you

1:33:05.747 --> 1:33:07.999
worse than
you've ever been hurt.

1:33:09.417 --> 1:33:10.835
You get me?

1:33:10.835 --> 1:33:13.588
Nod to show
you dig what I'm saying.

1:33:26.518 --> 1:33:28.228
He won't tell me who did this.

1:33:28.228 --> 1:33:30.438
- Ask him who did this.

1:33:30.438 --> 1:33:32.440
Tell your father who did this,
and he will drive

1:33:32.440 --> 1:33:34.317
to that little shit's house,
and he will beat

1:33:34.317 --> 1:33:36.319
- the living crap out of him.
- Is your nose broken?

1:33:36.319 --> 1:33:38.196
No, of course it's not broken.
You think I'd be sitting here

1:33:38.196 --> 1:33:39.697
- if his nose was broken?
- Who hit you?

1:33:39.697 --> 1:33:41.324
What do you care who it was?

1:33:41.324 --> 1:33:43.117
It's not like
you'll do anything about it.

1:33:43.117 --> 1:33:44.744
Tell me what happened first.

1:33:44.744 --> 1:33:46.538
What happened is I hate it here,

1:33:46.538 --> 1:33:49.874
and what happened is
you brought us here because...

1:33:49.874 --> 1:33:52.126
Because I got a better job,
so we moved.

1:33:52.126 --> 1:33:54.963
You don't even care
where you are.

1:33:54.963 --> 1:33:57.298
You get to go to work,
and that could be in Iceland.

1:33:57.298 --> 1:33:59.592
You're working
with your goddamn machines,

1:33:59.592 --> 1:34:02.679
so you get to be happy
while the rest of us are mis...

1:34:02.679 --> 1:34:04.180
- Just, come on.
- Don't.

1:34:04.180 --> 1:34:05.807
Well, but you-you're bleeding
on the carpet.

1:34:05.807 --> 1:34:07.183
It's a rental house.

1:34:07.183 --> 1:34:09.310
Do you even notice
how much we hate it here,

1:34:09.310 --> 1:34:12.647
where we're practically the
only Jewish people for miles

1:34:12.647 --> 1:34:14.941
and everything is awful?

1:34:14.941 --> 1:34:18.695
Do you even care
that this is your fault--

1:34:18.695 --> 1:34:20.029
everything
that's happening now--

1:34:20.029 --> 1:34:21.656
just because
you ran away from home

1:34:21.656 --> 1:34:23.032
and took all of us with you?!

1:34:23.032 --> 1:34:25.243
I came here so I could work
ten times harder

1:34:25.243 --> 1:34:26.786
with ten times
the responsibility,

1:34:26.786 --> 1:34:28.288
which seems to have escaped
everybody,

1:34:28.288 --> 1:34:29.873
s-so I could build us
a nice home and...

1:34:29.873 --> 1:34:31.291
Could everyone settle?
I want to say something.

1:34:31.291 --> 1:34:33.042
No, no. You didn't come here
to build houses.

1:34:33.042 --> 1:34:34.836
You didn't come here to work.
You ran away.

1:34:34.836 --> 1:34:36.588
I think you have something
to say to me, Sammy!

1:34:36.588 --> 1:34:38.089
And if I'm right about that,

1:34:38.089 --> 1:34:39.841
then get it off your chest
and say it to my face!

1:34:39.841 --> 1:34:42.218
I started therapy.

1:36:17.021 --> 1:36:19.232
Anyways,

1:36:19.232 --> 1:36:21.234
what I really wanted
to say is that,

1:36:21.234 --> 1:36:23.152
about yesterday,
what I told you was...

1:36:23.152 --> 1:36:25.405
it wasn't true, and I lied,

1:36:25.405 --> 1:36:27.615
and I'm sorry.

1:36:27.615 --> 1:36:29.158
But why?

1:36:29.158 --> 1:36:31.160
- What did I ever do to you?
- Oh, no, no.

1:36:31.160 --> 1:36:32.954
- It wasn't about you.
- Because that, like, really,

1:36:32.954 --> 1:36:35.164
- really wasn't cool, you know?
- No, I didn't mean to hurt...

1:36:35.164 --> 1:36:37.542
- I didn't mean to hurt you.
- Because I really love Logan.

1:36:37.542 --> 1:36:38.710
Yeah, she cried herself to sleep

1:36:38.710 --> 1:36:39.961
thinking he cheated on her.

1:36:39.961 --> 1:36:41.212
You ought to be more considerate

1:36:41.212 --> 1:36:43.214
of other people's feelings.

1:36:43.214 --> 1:36:45.049
Okay, but Logan told me
to say I killed Christ.

1:36:45.049 --> 1:36:46.384
- That wasn't Logan.
- What?

1:36:46.384 --> 1:36:47.969
- That was Chad.
- Why would he do that?

1:36:47.969 --> 1:36:50.013
Logan laughed.
He thought it was hilarious.

1:36:51.472 --> 1:36:53.474
He's Jewish.

1:36:53.474 --> 1:36:55.309
You don't say.

1:36:56.602 --> 1:36:59.147
Yeah, I mean, since the day
I was circumcised.

1:37:06.612 --> 1:37:09.157
So, how'd you know
she was a redhead?

1:37:09.157 --> 1:37:11.284
- Oh, my God.
- Hmm?

1:37:11.284 --> 1:37:13.494
He was making out
with Renee Reynolds?

1:37:16.372 --> 1:37:18.458
- If you were lying...
- Mm-hmm?

1:37:18.458 --> 1:37:20.960
...how'd you know
her hair color?

1:37:23.421 --> 1:37:25.256
Uh...

1:37:30.845 --> 1:37:33.347
Does it hurt?

1:37:33.347 --> 1:37:35.349
So, you don't believe in Jesus?

1:37:35.349 --> 1:37:37.435
Monica's, like,
totally hot on Jesus.

1:37:38.519 --> 1:37:40.146
I can't imagine my life
without him.

1:37:40.146 --> 1:37:43.357
Well, we've managed
for like 5,000 years,

1:37:43.357 --> 1:37:45.902
so I guess it's possible.

1:37:45.902 --> 1:37:48.446
Maybe we could...

1:37:48.446 --> 1:37:51.824
I don't know, get together
and pray on it.

1:37:53.868 --> 1:37:56.245
- What, like, you and me?

1:37:56.245 --> 1:37:58.331
We can ask him
to come into your heart

1:37:58.331 --> 1:38:02.710
and, you know, see what happens.

1:38:03.711 --> 1:38:05.880
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

1:38:05.880 --> 1:38:07.340
- I mean...

1:38:07.340 --> 1:38:10.051
What? Like, that would be,
like, when? Like, today?

1:38:14.388 --> 1:38:17.350
It's a lot, huh?

1:38:17.350 --> 1:38:21.145
It's sort of a shrine almost.

1:38:21.145 --> 1:38:23.564
A shrine to guys.

1:38:23.564 --> 1:38:25.066
L-Lots of guys.

1:38:25.066 --> 1:38:27.652
They're sexy.

1:38:27.652 --> 1:38:29.570
I guess.

1:38:32.865 --> 1:38:34.867
I mean, not Jesus.

1:38:34.867 --> 1:38:37.078
Jesus is sexy.

1:38:38.246 --> 1:38:40.248
Isn't that, like,
a sin or something?

1:38:40.248 --> 1:38:42.041
I don't know.

1:38:42.041 --> 1:38:44.252
He came to us as a man.

1:38:44.252 --> 1:38:47.004
A handsome young man.

1:38:47.004 --> 1:38:50.091
He could've come as a girl
or an old man

1:38:50.091 --> 1:38:52.093
or someone with leprosy, but...

1:38:52.093 --> 1:38:54.303
Nobody knows
what he really looked like.

1:38:55.096 --> 1:38:57.223
Probably, he looked like you.

1:38:57.223 --> 1:38:59.767
Oh, because... because he was...

1:38:59.767 --> 1:39:01.227
Jewish.

1:39:01.227 --> 1:39:03.437
A handsome Jewish boy.

1:39:04.772 --> 1:39:06.941
Just like you.

1:39:23.082 --> 1:39:25.001
Let's pray.

1:39:31.465 --> 1:39:33.551
Close your eyes.

1:39:35.469 --> 1:39:37.805
Lord, I'm here
with my friend Sammy...

1:39:37.805 --> 1:39:39.056
Sam.

1:39:39.056 --> 1:39:41.309
I'm here with
my good friend Sam,

1:39:41.309 --> 1:39:45.730
who's Jewish,
and he's a nice boy.

1:39:45.730 --> 1:39:50.276
Lord Jesus, he's good and brave,

1:39:50.276 --> 1:39:54.322
and he's funny, Lord, and...

1:39:54.322 --> 1:39:57.158
and I like him.

1:40:01.370 --> 1:40:03.289
Relax.

1:40:07.835 --> 1:40:09.420
Ask.

1:40:10.838 --> 1:40:12.673
Ask him to come into you.

1:40:12.673 --> 1:40:15.051
Ask him to enter you.

1:40:17.637 --> 1:40:19.680
Um...

1:40:19.680 --> 1:40:21.849
hi there, Jesus.

1:40:21.849 --> 1:40:24.560
It's me, Sam Fabelman.

1:40:26.145 --> 1:40:28.397
If you're real, show me

1:40:28.397 --> 1:40:30.650
- a sign or something, and...
- No, wait. You can't...

1:40:30.650 --> 1:40:34.403
You can't ask Jesus
to do tricks to impress you.

1:40:34.403 --> 1:40:36.239
You have to be humble.

1:40:36.239 --> 1:40:38.824
You have to beg him to.
I'll do it.

1:40:39.617 --> 1:40:42.662
I'm gonna beg the Holy Spirit
to come into me.

1:40:42.662 --> 1:40:45.790
I'm gonna draw the Spirit
in with my breath.

1:40:47.208 --> 1:40:49.877
Spirit, come into me!

1:40:49.877 --> 1:40:51.712
Please, Holy Spirit!

1:40:51.712 --> 1:40:54.215
I'm begging you,
sweet Holy Father,

1:40:54.215 --> 1:40:56.425
for the sake of my friend Sammy.

1:40:56.425 --> 1:40:57.677
Sam.

1:40:57.677 --> 1:40:59.262
Come into us, Jesus!

1:40:59.262 --> 1:41:01.222
Hear our prayer!

1:41:01.222 --> 1:41:02.848
Open your mouth.

1:41:02.848 --> 1:41:06.435
Open your mouth and take
the spirit of Christ into you.

1:41:33.963 --> 1:41:36.173
Monica, Sammy, I made snacks.

1:41:36.173 --> 1:41:38.259
- We're coming!

1:41:38.259 --> 1:41:40.011
- Oh...
- Tomorrow after school,

1:41:40.011 --> 1:41:41.971
want to meet out back
behind the bleachers?

1:41:41.971 --> 1:41:43.431
- Yeah.
- Cool.

1:41:43.431 --> 1:41:45.599
We can pray some more.

1:41:55.443 --> 1:41:58.487
When I was a girl
and I felt sad,

1:41:58.487 --> 1:42:01.198
I'd go to the zoo
and I'd watch the monkeys.

1:42:01.198 --> 1:42:02.950
They made you laugh?

1:42:02.950 --> 1:42:05.286
Yeah, yeah, the monkeyshines.

1:42:05.286 --> 1:42:07.330
Oh, but there was
more to it than that.

1:42:07.330 --> 1:42:09.332
It was...

1:42:09.332 --> 1:42:11.375
They understand
what we've done to them,

1:42:11.375 --> 1:42:13.336
with the cages
and the people pointing.

1:42:13.336 --> 1:42:15.129
We share that with them,

1:42:15.129 --> 1:42:17.423
the truth of
how cruel people are.

1:42:17.423 --> 1:42:19.091
But if you watch them
for long enough,

1:42:19.091 --> 1:42:21.969
you can tell they know stuff
we can't begin to imagine.

1:42:21.969 --> 1:42:23.804
Important stuff.

1:42:23.804 --> 1:42:25.973
And they're not gonna
let us in on it

1:42:25.973 --> 1:42:27.975
'cause it belongs to them.

1:42:27.975 --> 1:42:29.643
It's their own monkey business.

1:42:29.643 --> 1:42:32.396
Theirs. It's not ours. It's...

1:42:33.939 --> 1:42:36.025
Oh, I don't know.

1:42:36.025 --> 1:42:37.818
Self-possession.

1:42:37.818 --> 1:42:39.695
Right.

1:42:41.072 --> 1:42:43.407
They belong to themselves.

1:42:43.407 --> 1:42:45.701
If it belongs to itself,

1:42:45.701 --> 1:42:47.953
let it go back
to where it came from.

1:42:47.953 --> 1:42:50.289
Anyway, that's how come
I got a monkey.

1:42:50.289 --> 1:42:52.208
And a therapist.

1:42:52.208 --> 1:42:54.085
He throws his poop.

1:42:54.085 --> 1:42:55.878
The therapist?

1:42:55.878 --> 1:42:57.171
No, the monkey.

1:42:57.171 --> 1:42:58.672
That's why I'm staying
in a hotel.

1:42:58.672 --> 1:43:01.008
You don't have to.
We have plenty of room.

1:43:01.008 --> 1:43:02.927
My rabbi in New Jersey says

1:43:02.927 --> 1:43:05.471
a monkey in the house
isn't kosher.

1:43:05.471 --> 1:43:07.014
That's why we're not
going to eat him.

1:43:07.014 --> 1:43:08.808
Did you schedule him
for his polio vaccine?

1:43:08.808 --> 1:43:10.518
- They can get polio?
- Pass the peas.

1:43:10.518 --> 1:43:12.019
Well, they're susceptible
to pretty much everything

1:43:12.019 --> 1:43:14.188
- humans are, so yes.
- He hates going to the vet.

1:43:14.188 --> 1:43:15.689
You see, Monica, in this family,

1:43:15.689 --> 1:43:17.983
it's the scientists
versus the artists.

1:43:17.983 --> 1:43:19.402
Sammy's on my team.

1:43:19.402 --> 1:43:21.529
Takes after me,
except he's got real talent.

1:43:21.529 --> 1:43:22.696
Mom.

1:43:22.696 --> 1:43:24.115
And he's completely terrible
at science.

1:43:24.115 --> 1:43:25.699
Mm. And algebra.

1:43:25.699 --> 1:43:26.992
And sports.

1:43:26.992 --> 1:43:29.370
- Will you please stop?
- He showed me his camera.

1:43:29.370 --> 1:43:31.455
- Is he good at kissing?

1:43:31.455 --> 1:43:33.040
- I'll tell you later.
- Shut up!

1:43:33.040 --> 1:43:35.459
- He sleeps with a camera
under his pillow. -No, I don't.

1:43:35.459 --> 1:43:37.211
But he refuses
to actually shoot anything.

1:43:37.211 --> 1:43:39.171
He should shoot Ditch Day.

1:43:39.171 --> 1:43:41.340
- Mm. Mm-mm. -They still
don't have a photographer.

1:43:41.340 --> 1:43:42.716
- You could volunteer.
- What's Ditch Day?

1:43:42.716 --> 1:43:44.510
It doesn't matter.
I'm not going.

1:43:44.510 --> 1:43:45.928
Something seniors get to do
at the end of the year.

1:43:45.928 --> 1:43:47.680
They let us pretend like
we're ditching school,

1:43:47.680 --> 1:43:50.015
and we all take buses
to Santa Cruz Main Beach.

1:43:50.015 --> 1:43:51.600
You have to go! Everyone goes.

1:43:51.600 --> 1:43:53.436
My dad will lend you his camera.

1:43:53.436 --> 1:43:54.770
It's super fancy.

1:43:54.770 --> 1:43:56.564
Costs like a thousand dollars.

1:43:56.564 --> 1:43:59.400
It's called, like, a...
an "Air" something. I forget.

1:43:59.400 --> 1:44:00.943
- Wait, not an Arriflex.
- Right.

1:44:00.943 --> 1:44:04.196
Your dad owns
a 16 millimeter Arriflex?

1:44:05.072 --> 1:44:07.032
Wow. Wow, okay.
So, 16 millimeter on stock...

1:44:07.032 --> 1:44:09.034
See, usually it's the teacher
who shoots the Ditch Day movie,

1:44:09.034 --> 1:44:10.828
- and it's a big joke. -That's
two minutes, 45 seconds a roll.

1:44:10.828 --> 1:44:12.663
At ten bucks a roll,
for a whole day, that would be,

1:44:12.663 --> 1:44:14.039
- like, insanely expensive.
- I owe you a graduation check.

1:44:14.039 --> 1:44:15.916
My dad will get the school
to pay for it.

1:44:15.916 --> 1:44:17.668
And I need to rent a
16 millimeter editing machine,

1:44:17.668 --> 1:44:19.628
and I have no idea
how much that costs,

1:44:19.628 --> 1:44:21.046
- so it's not gonna work.
- My dad will rent one for you.

1:44:21.046 --> 1:44:24.008
Uh, we can rent it,
whatever it costs, right?

1:44:24.008 --> 1:44:25.926
Burt.

1:44:27.553 --> 1:44:29.889
Uh, what's wrong
with your Bolex?

1:44:29.889 --> 1:44:31.932
You could afford to be
a little encouraging.

1:44:31.932 --> 1:44:33.559
About what?

1:44:33.559 --> 1:44:35.352
About him making movies again.

1:44:35.352 --> 1:44:36.937
Well, I didn't say that.
I'm just talking...

1:44:36.937 --> 1:44:39.148
- Maybe he's moved on.
- On from what?

1:44:39.148 --> 1:44:41.525
He hasn't picked up his camera
once since we got here.

1:44:41.525 --> 1:44:42.985
He'll be going to college
this September.

1:44:42.985 --> 1:44:44.904
Maybe his feelings about it
have changed.

1:44:44.904 --> 1:44:47.531
He's growing up.
I'm enthusiastic about that.

1:44:47.531 --> 1:44:49.116
Filming is what he loves.

1:44:49.116 --> 1:44:50.868
- I don't think him...
- Oh, Jesus Christ. I'm sorry.

1:44:50.868 --> 1:44:52.828
Guys, can we please just
stop talking about me?

1:44:52.828 --> 1:44:54.371
I'd think that you,
more than anyone,

1:44:54.371 --> 1:44:55.664
should have some
understanding of what a...

1:44:55.664 --> 1:44:56.999
Let's go to your place
or something.

1:44:56.999 --> 1:44:58.918
Maybe your dad
can show me the camera.

1:44:58.918 --> 1:45:00.544
- ...a vocation, a-a calling is.
- All right. All right.

1:45:00.544 --> 1:45:01.962
We'll rent him the equipment.

1:45:01.962 --> 1:45:03.255
He hates the beach.

1:45:03.255 --> 1:45:04.757
That's why he doesn't want
to go to Ditch Day.

1:45:04.757 --> 1:45:06.342
But it's not your calling.

1:45:06.342 --> 1:45:08.552
Is that why you can't, uh,
respect it?

1:45:08.552 --> 1:45:09.970
I have respect for everything

1:45:09.970 --> 1:45:11.847
- he works hard doing.
- He's afraid.

1:45:11.847 --> 1:45:13.766
He's scared if he does, those
guys will beat him up again.

1:45:13.766 --> 1:45:16.018
What? No, I'm not. I never said
that I was scared of them.

1:45:16.018 --> 1:45:17.770
- You don't, though.
- You got beat up?

1:45:17.770 --> 1:45:19.772
You always dismiss
what he does, what anyone does,

1:45:19.772 --> 1:45:23.651
that's playful or imaginative
as a pastime or a hobby.

1:45:23.651 --> 1:45:25.486
You already won, Mitz.

1:45:25.486 --> 1:45:27.446
I surrendered.
I'm not taking the bait.

1:45:27.446 --> 1:45:28.989
Can you guys please
just cut it out?

1:45:28.989 --> 1:45:30.866
- Oh, who's baiting who?
- You're embarrassing me.

1:45:30.866 --> 1:45:32.451
I said I'd take him for his
polio shot the first five times

1:45:32.451 --> 1:45:33.869
- you asked me, didn't I?
- Well, you say you will,

1:45:33.869 --> 1:45:36.121
but I guess you don't mean it,
so I ask again

1:45:36.121 --> 1:45:37.831
- and again and again.
- He's scared of shots.

1:45:37.831 --> 1:45:40.376
- He's scared of the doctor.

1:45:41.210 --> 1:45:44.630
I am taking the goddamn monkey
to the vet, okay?

1:45:44.630 --> 1:45:46.173
Probably needs a tranquilizer

1:45:46.173 --> 1:45:47.675
with all this yelling.

1:45:47.675 --> 1:45:50.094
Can you ask your dad
about borrowing the camera?

1:45:50.094 --> 1:45:51.512
He'll say yes.

1:45:51.512 --> 1:45:53.514
Thank you.

1:45:53.514 --> 1:45:56.183
I'm filming Ditch Day.

1:45:56.183 --> 1:45:57.977
I think it's a great idea.

1:46:23.711 --> 1:46:25.713
- Nice!

1:46:30.968 --> 1:46:32.845
- Go, go, go, go, go!

1:49:05.748 --> 1:49:08.625
- Don't be scared.

1:49:13.922 --> 1:49:17.468
Your mom misses Phoenix
too much.

1:49:17.468 --> 1:49:18.844
Tell them the truth.

1:49:18.844 --> 1:49:20.846
And I can't leave.

1:49:20.846 --> 1:49:22.806
This is where my work is.

1:49:22.806 --> 1:49:24.141
I have to...

1:49:24.141 --> 1:49:25.726
That's crazy.

1:49:25.726 --> 1:49:28.562
You... you can't ruin everything

1:49:28.562 --> 1:49:30.773
because you miss one place

1:49:30.773 --> 1:49:33.108
and you're stuck someplace else.

1:49:33.108 --> 1:49:35.736
I miss Bennie too much.

1:49:35.736 --> 1:49:37.279
So?

1:49:37.279 --> 1:49:39.031
We all miss him.

1:49:39.823 --> 1:49:42.326
This is a different kind
of missing.

1:49:42.326 --> 1:49:43.952
Because what?

1:49:44.745 --> 1:49:46.622
You love Bennie?

1:49:46.622 --> 1:49:48.207
- Don't you love Daddy?

1:49:48.207 --> 1:49:49.291
Sure she does.

1:49:49.291 --> 1:49:51.251
- Of course I love Dad.
- And I love Mom.

1:49:51.251 --> 1:49:53.587
Then why is this
all of a sudden happening?!

1:49:53.587 --> 1:49:55.422
Stay together.

1:49:55.422 --> 1:49:58.383
You love each other,
and you love us,

1:49:58.383 --> 1:49:59.927
and we don't want this.

1:49:59.927 --> 1:50:02.095
We don't want to have to move
back and forth

1:50:02.095 --> 1:50:03.639
and not live with both of you.

1:50:03.639 --> 1:50:05.432
We can't. Dad, we can't.

1:50:05.432 --> 1:50:06.934
You're always so mean to him!

1:50:06.934 --> 1:50:08.852
That's why
you're getting divorced!

1:50:08.852 --> 1:50:10.771
It's because of you!

1:50:10.771 --> 1:50:12.147
Don't blame your mom.

1:50:12.147 --> 1:50:14.191
This wasn't her idea.
It was mine.

1:50:14.191 --> 1:50:17.194
- Don't-don't say that.
- No, it wasn't.

1:50:17.194 --> 1:50:19.822
She just said it was because
of Bennie, so stop lying!

1:50:19.822 --> 1:50:22.074
Both of you, stop lying!

1:50:22.074 --> 1:50:24.201
I'm giving your mom a chance

1:50:24.201 --> 1:50:28.914
to go back to, uh,
Phoenix to live...

1:50:55.482 --> 1:50:57.317
I don't understand
how you can go back

1:50:57.317 --> 1:50:59.611
to your beach blanket movie
after that.

1:50:59.611 --> 1:51:01.989
We're different, I guess.

1:51:17.963 --> 1:51:20.257
Is she gonna marry Bennie?

1:51:21.049 --> 1:51:23.218
If she wants to, she will.

1:51:24.970 --> 1:51:27.347
God, she's the most selfish
person in the world.

1:51:27.347 --> 1:51:30.559
It must've been hard for her,
married to a...

1:51:30.559 --> 1:51:32.561
a genius.

1:51:32.561 --> 1:51:34.521
Dad worships Mom.

1:51:34.521 --> 1:51:36.023
Okay.

1:51:36.940 --> 1:51:40.944
But maybe it's hard
being worshipped by someone

1:51:40.944 --> 1:51:42.946
you know you'll never
be as good as

1:51:42.946 --> 1:51:45.157
or ever do anything as good as.

1:51:45.157 --> 1:51:46.450
She...

1:51:47.576 --> 1:51:49.953
She laughs at Bennie's jokes...

1:51:51.580 --> 1:51:54.666
...but Dad's always
been her best audience.

1:51:54.666 --> 1:51:56.710
Come on.

1:51:56.710 --> 1:51:58.587
She'll be fine.

1:51:58.587 --> 1:52:01.548
She'll tell herself everything
happens for a reason.

1:52:01.548 --> 1:52:03.884
She'll make excuses
like she always does.

1:52:03.884 --> 1:52:05.886
You're way more selfish
than her.

1:52:07.679 --> 1:52:09.723
That's why you're angry at her.

1:52:09.723 --> 1:52:12.684
It's because she's scared,

1:52:12.684 --> 1:52:14.895
just like you, Sammy.

1:52:15.896 --> 1:52:19.900
Out of everyone
in this out-of-control,

1:52:19.900 --> 1:52:23.236
falling-apart family,

1:52:23.236 --> 1:52:26.406
the one who's most like Mitzi
is you.

1:52:29.368 --> 1:52:30.744
Wait.

1:52:32.913 --> 1:52:34.831
Look, before I show this
to the whole school,

1:52:34.831 --> 1:52:37.292
could you please
watch it with me?

1:53:24.131 --> 1:53:26.842
- Hold your breath!

1:53:33.348 --> 1:53:35.017
Here.

1:53:35.017 --> 1:53:38.103
Oh, wow.

1:53:48.739 --> 1:53:51.116
Did you find Jesus?

1:53:52.534 --> 1:53:54.453
In a jewelry store.

1:54:26.276 --> 1:54:27.944
Hey, man, look who's here.

1:54:27.944 --> 1:54:29.613
Hey!
Let's get this party started!

1:54:29.613 --> 1:54:31.698
- Let the festivities begin.

1:54:33.533 --> 1:54:35.535
So, in September,
when I move to L.A.,

1:54:35.535 --> 1:54:38.205
I'm gonna try and get work
in a movie studio.

1:54:38.205 --> 1:54:40.415
Thought you were going
to college.

1:54:41.500 --> 1:54:43.293
Could you...

1:54:44.377 --> 1:54:46.296
Would you ever consider
coming with me?

1:54:46.296 --> 1:54:48.507
I'm going to Texas A&M.

1:54:48.507 --> 1:54:49.716
You know that.

1:54:49.716 --> 1:54:52.469
Yes, I do.

1:54:52.469 --> 1:54:55.097
But I thought...

1:54:56.807 --> 1:55:00.477
...maybe you should
change your mind, because...

1:55:03.480 --> 1:55:05.524
Because what?

1:55:06.942 --> 1:55:09.152
- Because I love you.
- Ow!

1:55:09.152 --> 1:55:10.612
- Sammy!
- Oh, sorry!

1:55:10.612 --> 1:55:13.031
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1:55:13.824 --> 1:55:16.118
That's not possible.

1:55:16.118 --> 1:55:17.410
- What?

1:55:17.410 --> 1:55:18.829
N-No, it is.

1:55:18.829 --> 1:55:20.956
- Monica, I love you.

1:55:20.956 --> 1:55:23.041
That's impossible. Sammy...

1:55:23.041 --> 1:55:24.626
Sam.

1:55:25.710 --> 1:55:27.963
We only started dating like...

1:55:30.257 --> 1:55:31.842
Everything was so normal before.

1:55:31.842 --> 1:55:33.176
Why are you acting so...

1:55:33.176 --> 1:55:35.262
No, because
nothing's normal now.

1:55:35.262 --> 1:55:37.472
They're getting a divorce.

1:55:38.932 --> 1:55:40.600
What are you talking about?

1:55:40.600 --> 1:55:43.311
My mom and dad,
they're splitting up.

1:55:47.357 --> 1:55:49.943
Jesus Christ! This is prom!

1:55:49.943 --> 1:55:52.863
You can't just blurt something
out like that at prom!

1:55:52.863 --> 1:55:54.739
Wait.

1:55:56.950 --> 1:55:58.493
Monica!

1:55:58.493 --> 1:56:00.287
Look, that's-that's got
nothing to do with us, okay?

1:56:00.287 --> 1:56:02.205
- I'm not... -That's not why
I said that I love you.

1:56:02.205 --> 1:56:04.082
- I don't know why I...
- I'm not gonna change

1:56:04.082 --> 1:56:05.750
my whole life
and move to Hollywood

1:56:05.750 --> 1:56:09.462
because your parents are having
marital difficulties.

1:56:25.395 --> 1:56:27.814
You can get a refund.
I hardly wore it at all.

1:56:31.359 --> 1:56:33.612
Are you breaking up with me?

1:56:33.612 --> 1:56:38.533
Not at prom,
but of course, eventually.

1:56:41.286 --> 1:56:43.455
I'm gonna pray on it.

1:56:43.455 --> 1:56:47.375
And I'm gonna pray
really, really hard for you

1:56:47.375 --> 1:56:50.003
because you're such a fun boy
to kiss, but...

1:56:51.504 --> 1:56:53.173
Thank you. Thank you.

1:56:53.173 --> 1:56:55.675
Wonderful. Wonderful.

1:56:55.675 --> 1:56:59.262
Let's thank our band
for that great music.

1:56:59.262 --> 1:57:02.599
Sometimes we just can't
fix things, Sam...

1:57:03.892 --> 1:57:07.854
...and all we can do is suffer.

1:57:09.689 --> 1:57:12.400
Now we're gonna take
a little break from the dancing

1:57:12.400 --> 1:57:16.529
for a very special moment
for the class of 1964.

1:57:17.656 --> 1:57:21.701
Um, Mr. Samuel Fabelman,
where are you?

1:57:21.701 --> 1:57:23.203
Where is he?

1:57:24.037 --> 1:57:25.914
Okay.

1:57:25.914 --> 1:57:27.207
Bagelman!

1:57:27.207 --> 1:57:28.667
Bagelman!

1:57:28.667 --> 1:57:30.377
- Okay, everybody.

1:57:30.377 --> 1:57:32.212
- Face this way. Grab a chair.

1:57:32.212 --> 1:57:34.381
Let's all get close
to the screen.

1:57:35.548 --> 1:57:38.802
Right up front. Very good.

1:57:40.053 --> 1:57:43.765
Mr. Fabelman,
this is your big moment.

1:57:43.765 --> 1:57:49.646
We're ready to watch
your Technicolor masterpiece,

1:57:49.646 --> 1:57:53.066
"Ditch Day 1964."

1:57:57.153 --> 1:58:02.575
And as they say way down south
in Hollywoodland, "lights..."

1:58:02.575 --> 1:58:06.746
Uh, "lights, camera, action!"

1:59:57.565 --> 2:00:00.193
- Oh, no!

2:00:29.931 --> 2:00:31.558
- Aw.

2:01:41.044 --> 2:01:43.630
Whoo! Let's go! Come on!

2:01:44.589 --> 2:01:47.383
No, no, no, no, no.

2:01:49.052 --> 2:01:52.597
Logan, you were so incredible
up there.

2:01:52.597 --> 2:01:54.599
It was amazing.

2:02:27.382 --> 2:02:29.509
Why'd you do that?

2:02:31.761 --> 2:02:33.638
What?

2:02:33.638 --> 2:02:36.391
Why'd you make me
look like that?

2:02:38.685 --> 2:02:41.062
- In the film?
- Yes, in the film!

2:02:41.062 --> 2:02:43.398
Oh, shit! Shit.

2:02:44.440 --> 2:02:46.192
What's the matter with you?

2:02:46.192 --> 2:02:48.027
I've been a...
a total asshole to you.

2:02:48.027 --> 2:02:50.029
- I broke your nose, and then...
- You didn't break my nose.

2:02:50.029 --> 2:02:51.781
- Then you go and make me look
like-like that. -You almost--

2:02:51.781 --> 2:02:53.533
- You didn't break it.
- What's wrong with you?

2:02:53.533 --> 2:02:56.536
Logan, all I did was hold the
camera, and it saw what it saw.

2:02:56.536 --> 2:02:59.372
Oh, bullshit! Fabelman,
you made me look like...

2:02:59.372 --> 2:03:01.791
like this golden kind of thing.

2:03:01.791 --> 2:03:03.209
- Yeah? -And Claudia,
she just kissed me.

2:03:03.209 --> 2:03:05.003
- Mazel tov.
- In front of the whole school.

2:03:05.003 --> 2:03:06.713
- Okay, great. -I treat her
shittier than I treat you,

2:03:06.713 --> 2:03:08.631
- and now she wants to...
- You're welcome, man. Jesus...

2:03:08.631 --> 2:03:11.509
No, no. Don't...
Don't go. Don't go.

2:03:11.509 --> 2:03:14.554
I want to know why you did that.

2:03:14.554 --> 2:03:16.556
I don't know. I ought to have
my head examined.

2:03:16.556 --> 2:03:17.890
Am I supposed to feel bad now

2:03:17.890 --> 2:03:19.517
about all that shit
we did to you?

2:03:19.517 --> 2:03:20.810
Do you feel bad
about all that shit?

2:03:20.810 --> 2:03:22.312
That's none of
your goddamn business!

2:03:22.312 --> 2:03:24.230
-'Cause you should feel bad
about... -Oh, right!

2:03:24.230 --> 2:03:25.898
That's why you did it. You want
me to feel like crap about...

2:03:25.898 --> 2:03:28.693
I wanted you to be nice to me
for five minutes!

2:03:28.693 --> 2:03:30.987
Or I did it
to make my movie better.

2:03:30.987 --> 2:03:32.405
I don't know why.

2:03:32.405 --> 2:03:36.075
You are the biggest jerk
I've ever met in my entire life.

2:03:36.075 --> 2:03:39.579
I have a monkey at home
that's smarter than you!

2:03:39.579 --> 2:03:43.708
You dumb, anti-Semitic asshole!

2:03:43.708 --> 2:03:46.127
I made you look like
you could fly.

2:03:47.128 --> 2:03:48.838
But I can't fly.

2:03:48.838 --> 2:03:51.049
I can outrun any guy
in Santa Clara County,

2:03:51.049 --> 2:03:52.925
and I worked real hard
to do that.

2:03:52.925 --> 2:03:55.595
But you... you make me feel
like I'm some kind of failure

2:03:55.595 --> 2:03:57.805
or a phony or...
or like I'm supposed to be

2:03:57.805 --> 2:04:00.558
some guy I'm never gonna be,
not even in my dreams.

2:04:00.558 --> 2:04:02.018
You took that guy,
whoever he is,

2:04:02.018 --> 2:04:03.936
wherever you got him from,
and you put him up there

2:04:03.936 --> 2:04:06.064
on that screen
and told everyone...

2:04:06.064 --> 2:04:07.482
everyone that that's me.

2:04:07.482 --> 2:04:09.776
And that's not me.
That's... It's...

2:04:11.569 --> 2:04:15.114
Goddamn it. Goddamn it.

2:04:18.618 --> 2:04:20.662
Jesus, it wasn't supposed
to make you upset.

2:04:20.662 --> 2:04:22.705
I didn't mean to freak you out.
I didn't mean...

2:04:22.705 --> 2:04:25.500
Who cares what you meant?

2:04:26.626 --> 2:04:28.795
Fabelman!

2:04:30.213 --> 2:04:31.589
Oh, shit.

2:04:31.589 --> 2:04:32.715
You liar! You backstabbing liar!

2:04:32.715 --> 2:04:34.967
I'm gonna beat your...

2:04:46.813 --> 2:04:48.815
You totally bought it,
his whole snow job.

2:04:48.815 --> 2:04:51.109
You ate it up. You moron.

2:04:51.109 --> 2:04:53.778
Logan, you are so conceited
and dumb.

2:05:19.053 --> 2:05:21.764
Is something about to happen?

2:05:22.765 --> 2:05:24.684
You like living dangerously,
Fabelman.

2:05:24.684 --> 2:05:26.519
No, I don't.
I really, really don't.

2:05:26.519 --> 2:05:28.146
Yes, you do.

2:05:28.146 --> 2:05:32.066
But you tell anybody
about me getting, um...

2:05:32.066 --> 2:05:35.737
upset, that would be a mistake.

2:05:38.030 --> 2:05:39.532
Our secret.

2:05:39.532 --> 2:05:41.200
Okay?

2:05:41.200 --> 2:05:42.994
Definitely.

2:05:46.539 --> 2:05:48.875
Unless I make a movie about it.

2:05:50.001 --> 2:05:52.712
Which I'm never ever gonna do.

2:06:18.237 --> 2:06:20.156
You never...

2:06:21.324 --> 2:06:23.159
What's it like?

2:06:24.911 --> 2:06:28.247
It kind of shows you how
out of control everything is

2:06:28.247 --> 2:06:32.794
and how y-you're not
in charge of anything.

2:06:35.338 --> 2:06:37.548
A-And how it doesn't matter.

2:06:37.548 --> 2:06:39.258
I better not.

2:06:40.259 --> 2:06:43.137
In my head, everything's
already out of control.

2:06:45.598 --> 2:06:47.767
- You're full of shit.

2:06:47.767 --> 2:06:50.603
I got to split.
Claudia's waiting for me.

2:06:55.817 --> 2:06:59.445
Life's nothing like the movies,
Fabelman.

2:06:59.445 --> 2:07:00.780
Maybe not.

2:07:00.780 --> 2:07:03.366
But hey, in the end...

2:07:03.366 --> 2:07:05.618
you got the girl.

2:07:28.516 --> 2:07:31.394
Must have been some night.

2:07:33.938 --> 2:07:36.357
Did Monica like the corsage?

2:07:36.357 --> 2:07:39.735
- Yeah.
- Well, I told you she would.

2:07:47.660 --> 2:07:49.912
That time when I hit you...

2:07:49.912 --> 2:07:52.874
In-in Phoenix, when I...

2:07:52.874 --> 2:07:55.501
Oh, God. You remember.

2:07:56.961 --> 2:07:59.046
Not really.

2:07:59.046 --> 2:08:00.965
Oh, for the love of God,
it's not like

2:08:00.965 --> 2:08:03.426
I spent my whole life
hitting you.

2:08:03.426 --> 2:08:06.053
Once. I hit you once.

2:08:06.053 --> 2:08:07.680
It should've been memorable.

2:08:07.680 --> 2:08:09.181
Before the swimming test.

2:08:09.181 --> 2:08:11.183
Yes, before the swimming test!

2:08:11.183 --> 2:08:13.519
Yes. Well, I-I...

2:08:13.519 --> 2:08:16.898
I s-slapped you on your back...

2:08:18.024 --> 2:08:20.192
...as hard as I could.
I screwed up your tryouts,

2:08:20.192 --> 2:08:22.028
and you-you couldn't get
your merit badge,

2:08:22.028 --> 2:08:23.571
and then you couldn't make
Eagle Scout.

2:08:23.571 --> 2:08:25.114
- Ma, I made Eagle Scout.
- And I...

2:08:25.114 --> 2:08:27.158
- It wasn't a big deal.
- Well, I left a goddamn mark

2:08:27.158 --> 2:08:30.036
on your skin
in the sh-shape of my hand.

2:08:30.036 --> 2:08:32.371
And I need you to say
you forgive me for doing that.

2:08:32.371 --> 2:08:35.958
- Well, okay. I forgive you.
- Because... Because...

2:08:37.209 --> 2:08:39.211
- Because you're my kid.
- Mom, I forgive you.

2:08:39.211 --> 2:08:41.213
And-and-and my kids
mean more to me than...

2:08:41.213 --> 2:08:43.215
- Mom, I forgive you.
- ...anything else on the Earth.

2:08:43.215 --> 2:08:44.884
- I forgive you.
- Because...

2:08:44.884 --> 2:08:47.219
Please, please. Because how
am I ever gonna forgive myself?

2:08:47.219 --> 2:08:49.597
- I can't.
- Mom, I-I-I...

2:08:49.597 --> 2:08:51.057
I forgive you.

2:08:51.057 --> 2:08:53.017
The eggs are burning.

2:08:53.017 --> 2:08:55.645
Oh, God.

2:08:59.899 --> 2:09:02.944
I'm doing this thing.

2:09:03.903 --> 2:09:06.405
And I-I don't know
if it's the right thing,

2:09:06.405 --> 2:09:09.033
but it's a life-and-death
thing for me.

2:09:09.033 --> 2:09:11.494
And I'm sorry,
but everybody else

2:09:11.494 --> 2:09:13.829
is gonna have to hang on
for dear life.

2:09:13.829 --> 2:09:15.915
And somehow,

2:09:15.915 --> 2:09:19.502
we will survive this, all of us.

2:09:19.502 --> 2:09:22.588
Even your father,
who I adore with all my heart.

2:09:22.588 --> 2:09:26.759
He deserves so much better
than what I'm doing, but...

2:09:29.804 --> 2:09:32.598
...but Bennie needs me, dolly.

2:09:32.598 --> 2:09:34.767
And I need him.

2:09:34.767 --> 2:09:36.268
So much so that without him,

2:09:36.268 --> 2:09:38.145
I'm turning into someone
I don't know

2:09:38.145 --> 2:09:41.190
and none of you
will know me anymore.

2:09:41.190 --> 2:09:43.109
I'll just be that hateful person

2:09:43.109 --> 2:09:45.111
who did that terrible thing
to your back.

2:09:45.111 --> 2:09:49.281
And yes, this is the most
selfish thing I have ever done,

2:09:49.281 --> 2:09:53.119
but I've got to do this now
because, Sammy...

2:09:54.412 --> 2:09:57.456
...you do what your heart
says you have to,

2:09:57.456 --> 2:10:00.459
'cause you don't owe anyone
your life.

2:10:01.669 --> 2:10:03.629
Not even me.

2:10:09.802 --> 2:10:11.846
Oh... Are they ruined?

2:10:11.846 --> 2:10:14.807
I-I-I can make some more.

2:10:14.807 --> 2:10:16.517
Oh, no, no, no.

2:10:16.517 --> 2:10:18.227
I like 'em burnt.

2:10:22.148 --> 2:10:24.316
So, Monica dumped me.

2:10:24.316 --> 2:10:26.110
She did?

2:10:26.110 --> 2:10:28.821
Yeah, after I told her
about the divorce.

2:10:29.655 --> 2:10:31.240
Huh?

2:10:32.158 --> 2:10:34.785
Probably shouldn't have
asked her to marry me.

2:10:34.785 --> 2:10:36.912
- You did not.
- Oh, but...

2:10:36.912 --> 2:10:39.498
- Oh. You did?

2:10:40.541 --> 2:10:44.086
- In so many words.
-Poor girl.

2:11:05.441 --> 2:11:06.859
Dad?

2:11:10.613 --> 2:11:12.865
Hey, Dad, I'm home.

2:11:23.918 --> 2:11:25.836
Sammy?

2:11:31.550 --> 2:11:33.886
I think I'm having
a heart attack.

2:11:39.558 --> 2:11:41.727
- Come here.

2:11:50.236 --> 2:11:52.238
It's a panic attack.
Your mother gets them.

2:11:52.238 --> 2:11:54.782
- What did you do when she'd
get them? -I made her tea.

2:11:54.782 --> 2:11:56.325
Okay.

2:12:02.206 --> 2:12:05.084
Plus, you're exhausted.

2:12:05.084 --> 2:12:07.086
You don't sleep.

2:12:07.086 --> 2:12:08.921
I hear you walking around
all night

2:12:08.921 --> 2:12:10.381
or typing those letters,

2:12:10.381 --> 2:12:12.007
and the three hours' drive
to the college

2:12:12.007 --> 2:12:13.884
- every day and back, it's...
- Oh, no, no, no.

2:12:13.884 --> 2:12:15.427
I can't go back to that dorm.

2:12:15.427 --> 2:12:17.096
Maybe your roommate
settled down.

2:12:17.096 --> 2:12:18.639
He voted for Goldwater.

2:12:18.639 --> 2:12:20.641
I can't go back.

2:12:20.641 --> 2:12:22.017
Dad...

2:12:24.937 --> 2:12:27.106
I don't know...

2:12:27.106 --> 2:12:29.275
what to do anymore.

2:12:30.234 --> 2:12:32.194
I don't want to disappoint you,

2:12:32.194 --> 2:12:35.489
and I promised
that I'd stick it out,

2:12:35.489 --> 2:12:38.325
but two years is like forever,
and I hate school.

2:12:38.325 --> 2:12:40.578
- Like, a lot.

2:12:40.578 --> 2:12:45.374
And I want to get work
on a movie or a TV show,

2:12:45.374 --> 2:12:47.293
so I send out all those letters,

2:12:47.293 --> 2:12:49.295
but nobody ever writes back.

2:12:49.295 --> 2:12:51.797
And my life is just
going by so fast,

2:12:51.797 --> 2:12:54.008
but it's not getting anywhere.

2:12:56.385 --> 2:12:59.221
Concentrate on sipping.
It'll calm you down.

2:13:04.560 --> 2:13:06.812
Here. Uh...

2:13:09.356 --> 2:13:12.318
You can go through the mail
while I get the soup hot.

2:13:34.048 --> 2:13:36.383
It's from Mom.

2:13:37.426 --> 2:13:39.428
It's just a bunch
of goofy photos

2:13:39.428 --> 2:13:41.263
from some kind of block party.

2:14:27.685 --> 2:14:29.478
Dad?

2:14:31.730 --> 2:14:33.482
Dad, what's...

2:14:42.992 --> 2:14:45.077
Oh, Dad, I didn't mean to...

2:14:45.077 --> 2:14:47.621
If you hate school so much,
don't go.

2:14:48.747 --> 2:14:50.582
But... Dad, we need...

2:14:50.582 --> 2:14:52.293
I don't know.
I would like you to

2:14:52.293 --> 2:14:54.336
because this film thing...
I don't know.

2:14:54.336 --> 2:14:56.588
Maybe I should have
put my foot down about it

2:14:56.588 --> 2:14:59.258
years ago, but...

2:15:00.801 --> 2:15:04.221
I know you're gonna work
like the dickens

2:15:04.221 --> 2:15:05.931
on whatever you wind up doing

2:15:05.931 --> 2:15:09.101
because you're a chip
off the old block.

2:15:13.772 --> 2:15:17.359
We're never not going to know
each other, Sammy.

2:15:20.779 --> 2:15:23.324
How do you know that?

2:15:23.324 --> 2:15:25.159
You and Mom don't anymore.

2:15:25.159 --> 2:15:27.286
Yes, we do.

2:15:28.203 --> 2:15:30.372
We always will.

2:15:31.290 --> 2:15:33.751
I know it because...

2:15:35.544 --> 2:15:37.880
...we've gone too far
in our story

2:15:37.880 --> 2:15:41.133
to actually say "the end."

2:15:50.476 --> 2:15:52.895
Uh, you missed something
in the mail.

2:16:19.713 --> 2:16:21.548
Good news?

2:16:24.343 --> 2:16:26.678
They've ordered 32 half hours,

2:16:26.678 --> 2:16:30.182
Fridays at 8:30 p.m. on CBS,
starting September 17th.

2:16:30.182 --> 2:16:31.892
We already have six shows
in the can.

2:16:31.892 --> 2:16:34.311
It's like Stalag 17
or The Great Escape,

2:16:34.311 --> 2:16:36.021
- except it's funnier.
- Mm.

2:16:36.021 --> 2:16:37.439
And it's for television.

2:16:37.439 --> 2:16:38.857
- And it's funny.
- Yeah.

2:16:38.857 --> 2:16:40.734
Or at least I pray to God
that it's funny.

2:16:40.734 --> 2:16:42.528
Hogan's Heroes--
that's the title.

2:16:42.528 --> 2:16:43.987
What do you think?

2:16:43.987 --> 2:16:46.323
- Pretty catchy, right?
- Catchy. Yeah.

2:16:46.323 --> 2:16:48.033
And if all goes well,

2:16:48.033 --> 2:16:52.621
I might be able to offer you
something next season.

2:16:53.414 --> 2:16:56.458
Maybe assisting an assistant
to an assistant.

2:17:01.380 --> 2:17:03.298
You don't want to be
in TV anyway.

2:17:03.298 --> 2:17:06.510
Um, your letter said as much.

2:17:06.510 --> 2:17:08.804
By the way, I love this letter.

2:17:08.804 --> 2:17:10.764
- Oh.
- I used to write a whole bunch

2:17:10.764 --> 2:17:12.474
of these letters
when I was your age.

2:17:12.474 --> 2:17:15.018
You want to make movies.
Am I right?

2:17:15.018 --> 2:17:16.562
Well, yeah. Yes, I do.

2:17:16.562 --> 2:17:18.939
But look, I'm just happy
to start anywhere,

2:17:18.939 --> 2:17:20.732
- and-and that doesn't...

2:17:20.732 --> 2:17:22.568
You know who you need to meet?

2:17:22.568 --> 2:17:25.404
I mean, not for a job,
'cause he doesn't do that.

2:17:25.404 --> 2:17:27.406
How would you like to meet

2:17:27.406 --> 2:17:30.409
the greatest film director
who ever lived?

2:17:30.409 --> 2:17:32.870
And he's right across the hall.

2:17:34.913 --> 2:17:36.623
Come on.

2:17:41.420 --> 2:17:43.380
Wait here a minute.

2:17:52.473 --> 2:17:54.600
Um, this is Nona.

2:17:54.600 --> 2:17:56.393
Nona's gonna look after you.

2:17:56.393 --> 2:17:57.769
Um, he's not here. He's...

2:17:57.769 --> 2:17:59.188
- He's at lunch.
- Right.

2:17:59.188 --> 2:18:01.273
- You want to wait?
- Yeah, he'll wait.

2:18:01.273 --> 2:18:03.025
Sit.

2:18:04.109 --> 2:18:05.819
Good luck.

2:18:11.283 --> 2:18:12.993
Could be hours.

2:19:41.707 --> 2:19:44.710
All right, kid,
you got five minutes.

2:19:44.710 --> 2:19:46.920
Probably one. Stand up.

2:19:50.424 --> 2:19:52.426
Hey. L-Lose the tie.

2:19:52.426 --> 2:19:54.678
You'll stand a better chance.

2:21:04.247 --> 2:21:07.125
They tell me you want to be
a picture maker.

2:21:08.460 --> 2:21:10.629
Um, yes, sir, I do.

2:21:10.629 --> 2:21:12.464
Why?

2:21:12.464 --> 2:21:15.050
This business,
it'll rip you apart.

2:21:15.050 --> 2:21:17.594
W-Well...

2:21:18.970 --> 2:21:20.138
Mr. Ford, I...

2:21:20.138 --> 2:21:22.474
So, what do you know
about art, kid?

2:21:24.810 --> 2:21:26.478
I-I love your movies so much.

2:21:26.478 --> 2:21:28.480
No. Art.

2:21:28.480 --> 2:21:30.982
See that painting over there?

2:21:33.151 --> 2:21:35.153
Uh, yeah. I mean yes.

2:21:35.153 --> 2:21:36.655
Yes, I do see it.

2:21:36.655 --> 2:21:38.532
Walk over to it.

2:21:44.413 --> 2:21:47.374
Well, what's in it? Describe it.

2:21:47.374 --> 2:21:49.251
Oh, okay. Um...

2:21:49.251 --> 2:21:51.253
So, there are two guys,

2:21:51.253 --> 2:21:53.505
and they're on horseback,

2:21:53.505 --> 2:21:55.257
and they're looking
for something.

2:21:55.257 --> 2:21:56.508
So maybe they're scouting...

2:21:56.508 --> 2:21:58.635
No. No.

2:21:58.635 --> 2:22:00.637
Where's the horizon?

2:22:00.637 --> 2:22:02.848
The-the horizon?

2:22:02.848 --> 2:22:05.350
- Where is it?
- Yeah, it's at the bottom.

2:22:05.350 --> 2:22:07.018
That's right.

2:22:07.018 --> 2:22:09.688
Walk over to this painting.

2:22:15.694 --> 2:22:17.070
Well?

2:22:18.697 --> 2:22:20.782
Right, okay.
So, there are five cowboys.

2:22:20.782 --> 2:22:22.951
- You know, they could be
Indian... -No, no, no, no, no!

2:22:22.951 --> 2:22:24.745
Where's the goddamn horizon?

2:22:24.745 --> 2:22:26.538
Um, it's-it's there.

2:22:26.538 --> 2:22:28.457
- Where?
- At the top of the painting.

2:22:28.457 --> 2:22:30.292
All right, get over here.

2:22:32.502 --> 2:22:34.713
Now, remember this.

2:22:34.713 --> 2:22:37.090
When the horizon's
at the bottom,

2:22:37.090 --> 2:22:38.967
it's interesting.

2:22:38.967 --> 2:22:41.428
When the horizon's at the top,

2:22:41.428 --> 2:22:43.555
it's interesting.

2:22:43.555 --> 2:22:45.599
When the horizon's
in the middle,
