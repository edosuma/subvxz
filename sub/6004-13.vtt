the flarg do we go now?

00:06.841 --> 00:09.308
Apparently nowhere, Rocket.
Quill's Boom Box

00:09.310 --> 00:11.943
suddenly stopped giving us
new coordinates, so...

00:11.946 --> 00:14.346
So what, Gamora?
This whole Cosmic Seed trail

00:14.348 --> 00:16.114
has been nothing
but a wild-goose chase?

00:16.117 --> 00:18.317
I do not recall
chasing any wild geese.

00:18.319 --> 00:20.152
But I believe
we should go after Thanos

00:20.154 --> 00:22.521
so I may exact my revenge.
"So I may exact my revenge,"
blah, blah, blah.

00:22.523 --> 00:25.224
Tell me something I ain't
heard a billion times
before, Drax.

00:25.226 --> 00:30.529
What we should do
is go after a bounty
to make some units. Huh?

00:30.531 --> 00:31.964
I am Groot.

00:31.966 --> 00:34.900
No. We should follow
the one clue we have left.

00:34.902 --> 00:37.369
This Spartax symbol
on the CryptoCube.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.538
Ah, good idea, Gammy.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.875
Plenty of rich suckers
on Spartax for the taking.

Set course for Spar...

00:45.379 --> 00:46.812

00:46.814 --> 00:49.181
Spartax is the last place
I wanna go right now.

00:49.183 --> 00:50.849
It's personal.

00:50.851 --> 00:52.584

Huh?

01:10.671 --> 01:14.773
Nice. No new coordinates,

01:32.226 --> 01:34.193
The energy signal

much about art,

11:21.313 --> 11:23.348
Argh!
(GROANS)

11:27.987 --> 11:30.188
Hey! Give that back.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.625
I always wanted
to get my hands
on this artifact.

11:33.627 --> 11:37.896
Although you're not the one
I was expecting to find
in possession of it.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.665
Yeah? Well, you're dealing
with Star-Lord now.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.167
Who?

11:42.169 --> 11:45.203
Never mind him.
Who the krutack are you?

11:45.205 --> 11:47.038
The dude
from the statue.

11:47.040 --> 11:51.342
Yes. Though I prefer,
"Loki, Prince of Mischief,

11:51.344 --> 11:54.179
"and rightful heir
to the throne of Asgard"

11:54.181 --> 11:56.748
to "dude."

11:56.750 --> 11:59.317
What do you want
with us, dude?

11:59.319 --> 12:04.122
You have quite a large mouth
for such a puny creature.

12:04.124 --> 12:07.325
But the truth is,
the two of you
mean nothing to me.

12:07.327 --> 12:11.396
I planted the Destroyer Armor
for the CryptoCube's owner
to find

12:11.398 --> 12:14.332
so that I could keep track
of the Cosmic Seed.

12:14.334 --> 12:17.035
Now, I need to be sure
such a powerful item

12:17.037 --> 12:21.005
doesn't fall into the hands
of mere mortals.

12:21.007 --> 12:24.542
So, what do you know
of the Cosmic Seed?

12:24.544 --> 12:26.878
I was gonna ask you
the same question.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.747
And while
we're asking questions,

12:28.749 --> 12:32.884
who was the bearded dude I saw
when my brain was connected
to your metal suit?

12:32.886 --> 12:37.722
The question you should
be asking is, why are you,
a lowly thief,

12:37.724 --> 12:41.359
able to operate this device
of Spartaxian royalty?

12:41.361 --> 12:43.895
Wait. What? Royalty?

12:43.897 --> 12:46.431
You may yet prove
useful to me.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.266

Ha! Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo!

13:09.489 --> 13:11.156
Didn't know you could do that.

Uh-oh.

I'm not so curious

14:55.428 --> 14:57.729
to find out what happens
when the visor opens.

16:41.201 --> 16:42.700
get the armor

16:42.702 --> 16:44.702

you would be difficult
to deceive with this evidence,

20:54.954 --> 20:58.522
But Thor will be
much more suggestible.

20:58.524 --> 21:01.192

goes to war,
