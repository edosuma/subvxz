WEBVTT

00:24.480 --> 00:27.840
Oh, I can't stop looking at it.

00:24.480 --> 00:27.840
It's gorgeous.

00:27.880 --> 00:30.800
And this place, it's everything I

00:27.880 --> 00:30.800
ever dreamed of.

00:34.320 --> 00:37.560
Oi! You're marrying me, Darren Moore.

00:37.600 --> 00:40.040
You're mine now. Forever.

02:02.280 --> 02:06.000
Coconut? -No, thank you.

02:02.280 --> 02:06.000
I've got a coconut.

02:06.040 --> 02:09.480
No, sorry, not really

02:06.040 --> 02:09.480
a chilli man myself.

02:09.520 --> 02:13.000
Yes, it looks absolutely delicious, yeah.

02:13.040 --> 02:15.480
It's not my size, I don't think. No.

02:15.520 --> 02:18.040
Yeah, yeah, perhaps on the way back.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.800
Am I too late

02:37.840 --> 02:39.280
I'm sorry, sir.

02:39.320 --> 02:40.640
I'm a police officer.

02:42.040 --> 02:44.920
I'm a police officer and I want a cup of tea.

02:44.960 --> 02:46.640
Well, welcome to the family, Darren.

02:46.680 --> 02:48.760
Cheers! Thanks, Mike.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.280
Don't worry, we'll look after her.

02:50.320 --> 02:51.880
You'd better.

02:51.920 --> 02:54.520
-To Darren and Lisa! -To Darren and Lisa!

02:54.560 --> 02:56.800
Now, everybody, back down here in an hour for cocktails.

02:56.840 --> 02:59.360
Oh, good idea. Come on, hurry up.

02:59.920 --> 03:01.520
Come on, let's go.

03:39.840 --> 03:41.280
Hi.

03:43.320 --> 03:45.680
Okay, so, um...

03:45.720 --> 03:49.960
Your biggest cocktail. You know,

03:45.720 --> 03:49.960
umbrella, swizzle sticks,

03:50.000 --> 03:52.680
rum, tequila, whatever you've got,

03:50.000 --> 03:52.680
just chuck it in, set fire to

03:52.720 --> 03:55.400
the whole thing if you want and bring it to the table,

03:55.440 --> 03:59.720
because I... Oh, I am so loving this place.

03:59.760 --> 04:03.280
You've been looking at your watch every five

03:59.760 --> 04:03.280
minutes since lunch,

04:03.320 --> 04:06.000
-so I followed you. -That is totally underhand.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.960
Excuse me, sir, I didn't sneak away from work.

04:10.120 --> 04:13.200
I just wanted a decent cup of tea.

04:13.240 --> 04:15.160
-Alone. -You think I'm

04:13.240 --> 04:15.160
happy with this?

04:15.200 --> 04:16.840
I am stuck with you, you're stuck with me.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.440
Thanks for reminding me.

04:18.480 --> 04:20.680
The way I see it, we may as well

04:18.480 --> 04:20.680
make the best of it.

04:20.720 --> 04:22.440
Starting with...

04:22.480 --> 04:24.040
Mmm! That.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.360
-Yes.

05:21.040 --> 05:22.880
WOMAN:  <i>Please report</i>

05:21.040 --> 05:22.880
<i>current situation.</i>

05:22.920 --> 05:25.640
<i>Can you confirm ETA? Over.</i>

05:37.080 --> 05:38.680
Lisa!

05:41.600 --> 05:44.280
Victim fell from the fifth floor,

05:41.600 --> 05:44.280
the VIP suites.

05:44.320 --> 05:45.720
On her wedding day.

05:45.760 --> 05:48.280
We need statements from the hotel staff and witnesses

05:48.320 --> 05:50.920
and a forensics and scene of crime

05:48.320 --> 05:50.920
team assembled.

05:50.960 --> 05:53.000
Then there's the family.

05:53.040 --> 05:57.120
Well, that's the forensics and crime scene

05:53.040 --> 05:57.120
team assembled.

06:06.440 --> 06:08.840
Is that CCTV camera recording?

06:08.880 --> 06:10.600
Yes, sir.

06:14.280 --> 06:16.000
Yeah, come on.

06:16.040 --> 06:19.120
Hang on.

06:19.160 --> 06:22.400
Good afternoon. My name is William and I'm

06:19.160 --> 06:22.400
the butler for this floor.

06:22.440 --> 06:24.120
May I show you to Suite 502?

06:34.400 --> 06:36.960
You reckon they give special rates to cops?

06:37.000 --> 06:39.520
Dwayne, I don't think I could afford

06:37.000 --> 06:39.520
even the special rates.

06:39.560 --> 06:41.280
-So, what are we... -Uh-uh.

06:52.680 --> 06:58.240
Ugh. Right, so if the victim was shot

06:52.680 --> 06:58.240
and fell from the balcony...

06:58.280 --> 07:01.280
What was that sticking out of her,

06:58.280 --> 07:01.280
a harpoon?

07:01.320 --> 07:04.920
It was probably a bolt fired from a Predator 4500 speargun.

07:05.880 --> 07:07.320
It's the yellow stripe model.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.240
-Yes.

07:10.280 --> 07:12.080
Because you snorkel?

07:12.120 --> 07:15.080
No, because it is what it says down the side.

07:21.880 --> 07:23.520
Right, everyone, start bagging evidence.

07:23.560 --> 07:26.680
I want it logged and back to

07:23.560 --> 07:26.680
the station pronto.

07:28.320 --> 07:31.240
Okay, so that was the victim's room, was it?

07:31.280 --> 07:33.960
No, sir. The bridal suite is over there.

07:34.920 --> 07:36.680
So, whose room's this?

07:36.720 --> 07:39.720
That was vacated this morning. The maid had cleaned it.

07:36.720 --> 07:39.720
It was empty.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.240
Then how did the victim get into it?

07:42.280 --> 07:44.960
I wouldn't know, sir.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.960
Right. So, if she was murdered in there

07:45.000 --> 07:48.960
and this is the bridal suite,

07:49.000 --> 07:50.880
what else have we got?

07:50.920 --> 07:54.240
This is the best man, Mr Adam Fairs.

07:54.280 --> 07:57.560
-This is Sally Watson,

07:57.600 --> 08:00.800
Lisa Watson's sister and chief bridesmaid.

08:00.840 --> 08:04.720
And the mother and father of the bride,

08:00.840 --> 08:04.720
Mr and Mrs Watson.

08:04.760 --> 08:07.840
-Oh, how long have... -Could anyone have

08:04.760 --> 08:07.840
used these stairs?

08:07.880 --> 08:10.160
No, sir, those doors are alarmed.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.760
-Yes.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.240
And yet!

08:21.960 --> 08:23.680
Yes.

08:23.720 --> 08:25.640
So the killer couldn't have got in that way.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.520
Or out that way.

08:27.560 --> 08:31.480
But the question still remains.

08:31.520 --> 08:34.360
How did the victim get into a room

08:31.520 --> 08:34.360
she didn't have a key to?

08:40.960 --> 08:42.440
I thought you said this room had been cleaned?

08:42.480 --> 08:44.160
Yes, sir.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.360
This is a "Cleaning in Progress" label.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.360
Why hasn't it been removed?

08:46.400 --> 08:47.680
I wouldn't know, sir.

08:47.720 --> 08:49.520
Do you think that's important?

08:49.560 --> 08:52.640
Well, I wouldn't ask otherwise, would I?

08:52.680 --> 08:54.920
Okay. Could you excuse us just for a moment?

09:03.320 --> 09:06.360
I am a Detective Sergeant in

09:03.320 --> 09:06.360
the Sainte-Marie Police Force.

09:06.400 --> 09:10.240
I graduated top of my year, I have three

09:06.400 --> 09:10.240
commendations for bravery,

09:10.280 --> 09:13.920
I've been shot twice and I could almost certainly beat

09:10.280 --> 09:13.920
you in a fist fight.

09:13.960 --> 09:16.640
Whereas you, you are a rude man.

09:16.680 --> 09:18.960
You are ignorant, full of your own

09:16.680 --> 09:18.960
self-importance,

09:19.000 --> 09:22.120
expecting everyone to follow you around

09:19.000 --> 09:22.120
and hang on your every word?

09:22.160 --> 09:24.480
From now on, you treat me with

09:22.160 --> 09:24.480
a little more respect

09:24.520 --> 09:28.120
or I'll be forced to forget I'm a police officer. Okay?

09:31.240 --> 09:32.840
RICHARD: After you.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.240
First question, where on earth would the killer

09:40.000 --> 09:44.240
get a speargun from?

09:45.680 --> 09:46.720
In the Caribbean?

09:48.880 --> 09:51.960
-Yes, ma'am.

09:53.320 --> 09:54.480
Hmm.

10:17.440 --> 10:19.640
How could anyone do such a thing?

10:22.680 --> 10:25.560
-DIANA: Darren. -It's okay, I'll... I'll go.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.960
Diving's a popular activity with your guests, is it?

10:31.000 --> 10:34.360
Yes, sir. Particularly with

10:31.000 --> 10:34.360
the female guests.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.120
Why is that?

10:36.160 --> 10:38.000
William, I've told you,

10:38.040 --> 10:40.160
you want to get the ladies, you've got to get a new look.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.440
I wouldn't know, sir.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.760
-Yes.

10:49.880 --> 10:51.520
Detective Inspector Richard Poole.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.920
The hotel has 15 spearguns.

10:55.960 --> 10:58.120
-I'll let you know tomorrow.

10:58.160 --> 10:59.520
Well, can't you just count them now?

10:59.560 --> 11:01.160
Some might be in the hotel workshop.

11:01.200 --> 11:02.680
I'll let you know in the morning

11:01.200 --> 11:02.680
when they open.

11:02.720 --> 11:04.640
Did you take Lisa Moore out diving at all?

11:04.680 --> 11:06.680
Or Lisa Watson, as she was.

11:06.720 --> 11:09.120
I don't think so. I'll check

11:06.720 --> 11:09.120
the hotel booking form.

11:09.160 --> 11:10.320
Tomorrow?

11:13.440 --> 11:17.880
I understand your diving school's very popular with

11:13.440 --> 11:17.880
the hotel's female guests?

11:17.920 --> 11:21.040
The coral is beautiful. Women appreciate beauty.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.240
Must be very distracting for you,

11:21.080 --> 11:23.240
teaching women to dive,

11:23.280 --> 11:26.600
in their bikinis, all day.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.840
Have you ever had a relationship

11:26.640 --> 11:28.840
with one of the female guests?

11:28.880 --> 11:31.680
STEFAN: Womanising diving instructor. It's a little

11:28.880 --> 11:31.680
cliched, don't you think?

11:31.720 --> 11:33.240
Did you carve all these?

11:33.280 --> 11:34.640
Yeah. Do you like 'em?

11:35.040 --> 11:36.320
Very much.

11:38.800 --> 11:42.840
So, that's the inventory for the spearguns

11:38.800 --> 11:42.840
and the booking forms

11:42.880 --> 11:46.160
and all by first thing tomorrow,

11:42.880 --> 11:46.160
if you would. Thank you.

11:48.840 --> 11:52.040
So here is the bridal party returning from the beach.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.720
Oh, hey, hey, pause that.

11:56.760 --> 11:58.600
Um, go back a few seconds.

12:01.640 --> 12:03.160
Yeah. Look.

12:04.520 --> 12:06.360
The bride just said something to the best man.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.440
-Adam Fairs.

12:09.680 --> 12:10.880
Play it again, would you?

12:15.880 --> 12:19.240
Uh, run it on.

12:19.280 --> 12:22.080
Okay, so the bridal party are all on the floor.

12:19.280 --> 12:22.080
What happens next?

12:22.120 --> 12:25.000
No one comes or goes for five minutes.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.520
What?

12:32.800 --> 12:35.840
Your behaviour with

12:32.800 --> 12:35.840
Jacques Cousteau back there.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.960
-Oh, no, I gave him yours.

12:41.880 --> 12:46.640
-Look, you can't just go picking up...

12:46.680 --> 12:50.080
CAMILLE: Oh! Who's that? MANAGER:

12:46.680 --> 12:50.080
The maid, Margaret Dubois.

12:50.120 --> 12:53.800
She's already on the VIP floor,

12:50.120 --> 12:53.800
but this is her leaving.

12:53.840 --> 12:56.520
And no one uses the lift either to go up

12:53.840 --> 12:56.520
to the VIP suites

12:56.560 --> 12:59.640
or to leave until 15:10.

12:59.680 --> 13:02.520
Lisa Moore is killed about now.

13:02.560 --> 13:04.240
So watch.

13:09.960 --> 13:12.280
RICHARD: Okay, then, pause that.

13:14.360 --> 13:17.920
Well, no one could have used the stairs, no one else came

13:14.360 --> 13:17.920
up in the lift,

13:17.960 --> 13:20.640
so, one of those six people killed Lisa Moore.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.400
RICHARD: Okay, things that don't make sense.

13:29.440 --> 13:31.200
Why a speargun?

13:31.240 --> 13:33.840
It's not the easiest weapon to get

13:31.240 --> 13:33.840
in and out of a room, is it?

13:33.880 --> 13:37.400
And why was a "Cleaning in Progress" label left on

13:33.880 --> 13:37.400
the handle of the room?

13:37.440 --> 13:39.240
Can't that just have been a mistake?

13:39.280 --> 13:40.840
-Yeah.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.400
A bit of a coincidence, don't you think?

13:42.440 --> 13:43.800
Why not?

13:43.840 --> 13:45.600
I don't believe in coincidences.

13:45.640 --> 13:47.480
These are the names of the wedding party.

13:47.520 --> 13:50.360
I'd like you to get on to DCI Roy

13:47.520 --> 13:50.360
Halliwell back in London.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.160
Tell him I'd consider it a personal favour

13:52.200 --> 13:55.880
if he'd run them through the computer,

13:52.200 --> 13:55.880
see what he can dig up.

13:55.920 --> 13:58.360
Thanks, Fidel. So, what are we doing?

14:01.000 --> 14:05.480
Right. Yes, well, I think first we should go and

14:01.000 --> 14:05.480
talk to the family.

14:09.960 --> 14:11.520
RICHARD: We're very sorry for your loss,

14:11.560 --> 14:13.960
but we have a few questions we need to ask.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.840
Well, surely you're not saying that any of us

14:14.000 --> 14:16.840
are under suspicion?

14:16.880 --> 14:20.240
At this stage, we're simply trying to establish all

14:16.880 --> 14:20.240
the facts of the case.

14:20.280 --> 14:23.080
Do you know anyone who would want to

14:20.280 --> 14:23.080
harm your daughter?

14:23.120 --> 14:26.640
It was obviously a madman or a disgruntled

14:23.120 --> 14:26.640
hotel employee.

14:26.680 --> 14:28.920
Nonetheless, in order to do our job,

14:28.960 --> 14:32.120
we need to establish where everyone was at the time of

14:28.960 --> 14:32.120
your daughter's death.

14:32.160 --> 14:35.160
Of course, we'll do

14:32.160 --> 14:35.160
everything we can to help.

14:36.560 --> 14:39.440
So, Mr Watson.

14:39.480 --> 14:43.560
Yeah, well, we just all came back up

14:39.480 --> 14:43.560
to change after the wedding.

14:48.160 --> 14:50.320
May I take your leis?

14:50.360 --> 14:52.280
Can I offer you a cocktail?

14:52.320 --> 14:53.640
Thank you.

15:00.040 --> 15:02.280
RICHARD: And where were you, Mrs Watson?

15:02.320 --> 15:04.160
I was out on the balcony.

15:05.640 --> 15:08.320
Did you see your daughter fall from the balcony next door?

15:08.360 --> 15:10.760
She's not her daughter.

15:10.800 --> 15:13.720
-I am, though. -MIKE: Sally, please, not now.

15:17.240 --> 15:19.560
Lisa's mother died when she was young.

15:19.600 --> 15:22.120
When I met Diana, she already had Sally.

15:22.160 --> 15:24.280
So, Lisa was your stepdaughter.

15:25.360 --> 15:27.840
When I saw her

15:27.880 --> 15:31.080
lying on the rocks like that, I...

15:31.120 --> 15:33.080
I started to scream and I couldn't stop.

15:40.200 --> 15:43.360
-Yes, sir.

15:43.400 --> 15:46.840
<i>I was making cocktails</i> <i>when I heard Mrs Watson.</i>

15:50.320 --> 15:52.240
I believe Mr Watson came from the bedroom

15:52.280 --> 15:54.080
as I came from the kitchen.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.800
Darren, this is the police.

15:58.840 --> 16:00.120
If you're not up to it,

16:00.160 --> 16:01.960
then I am sure that they will understand...

16:02.000 --> 16:04.840
Look, this is a complete waste of time. We were all in

16:02.000 --> 16:04.840
our rooms, okay?

16:04.880 --> 16:06.080
Sweetheart, please...

16:06.120 --> 16:08.000
Dad, they're just going to go around one by one.

16:08.040 --> 16:11.120
I was in my room. Adam was in his room.

16:08.040 --> 16:11.120
Darren...

16:11.160 --> 16:13.120
I don't know, but you should be out there

16:13.160 --> 16:15.400
looking for Lisa's killer, not just standing

16:13.160 --> 16:15.400
around here chatting.

16:18.680 --> 16:20.040
SALLY: Well, answer it.

16:22.280 --> 16:24.160
I'm sorry.

16:24.200 --> 16:27.840
MAN:<i> Adam, are you there?</i> ADAM: Hang on.

16:27.880 --> 16:31.200
Sally's right. I was in my room.

16:27.880 --> 16:31.200
We were all in our rooms.

16:31.840 --> 16:34.320
I've got to take this.

16:34.360 --> 16:37.720
-Yeah.

16:37.760 --> 16:39.880
Yeah, Lisa said she was going to go

16:37.760 --> 16:39.880
for a drink with her dad

16:39.920 --> 16:42.360
and I was going to change my shirt

16:39.920 --> 16:42.360
and join them.

16:43.440 --> 16:44.800
That's when it happened.

16:49.440 --> 16:51.720
-It's Lisa! Come down!

16:54.360 --> 16:55.760
RICHARD: So, you were all in your rooms?

16:55.800 --> 16:57.440
It would seem so.

16:58.880 --> 17:03.560
Does anyone know why Mrs Moore went into Suite 502?

17:03.600 --> 17:05.520
Or know how she got into the room?

17:08.480 --> 17:11.480
Have any of you taken a hotel diving lesson?

17:12.080 --> 17:13.840
Yes. Lisa did.

17:14.880 --> 17:16.720
Just Lisa?

17:16.760 --> 17:18.520
Yeah. Why?

17:19.960 --> 17:23.000
Thank you for your time. Our condolences for your loss.

17:35.400 --> 17:39.040
So it turns out the victim went diving with

17:35.400 --> 17:39.040
Stefan after all.

17:40.920 --> 17:42.760
Yes, well done for that.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.840
Ah, DCI Halliwell.

17:54.880 --> 17:57.280
Hello, this is police officer Fidel Best here

17:57.320 --> 18:00.520
calling from Honore Police Station

17:57.320 --> 18:00.520
in Sainte-Marie.

18:00.560 --> 18:03.200
It's an island in the Caribbean.

18:03.240 --> 18:06.000
Now, DI Richard Poole asked us to call you...

18:07.760 --> 18:10.680
Well, of course, sir. It's just gone 6:00 p.m.

18:20.720 --> 18:22.200
Margaret?

18:30.920 --> 18:33.320
The hotel manager says you are the maid

18:33.360 --> 18:36.120
who cleaned the VIP suites this afternoon?

18:36.160 --> 18:38.520
Did you see anything out of place

18:36.160 --> 18:38.520
at all or odd,

18:38.560 --> 18:40.760
-Mmm-mmm.

18:40.800 --> 18:43.520
Then perhaps you can tell us why you left a "Cleaning

18:40.800 --> 18:43.520
in Progress" label

18:43.560 --> 18:45.320
on the door of Suite 502.

18:45.360 --> 18:46.760
Oh, I must've forgotten to take it off.

18:48.280 --> 18:50.720
So, you've been cleaning the rooms

18:48.280 --> 18:50.720
on this floor

18:50.760 --> 18:52.760
since the wedding party arrived?

18:52.800 --> 18:55.360
Is there anything at all you think we should know?

18:58.360 --> 18:59.960
Well, there was one thing.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.080
<i>I had just finished my work</i> <i>and I went back to Room 502.</i>

19:03.120 --> 19:04.920
<i>I opened the door</i> <i>and that's when she came out.</i>

19:04.960 --> 19:08.080
-Oh, no.

19:08.120 --> 19:10.480
Please? Please, I'll be really quick.

19:11.840 --> 19:14.120
Thank you so much. Thank you.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.720
So, you let her in?

19:17.760 --> 19:20.520
Look, please don't tell anyone.

19:17.760 --> 19:20.520
I've been in trouble before.

19:20.560 --> 19:23.920
It's the butler on that floor, William,

19:20.560 --> 19:23.920
he's always on my case.

19:23.960 --> 19:25.480
Your secret's safe with us.

19:25.520 --> 19:27.360
It's just he's so stiff and uptight.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.880
You have no idea what it's like

19:27.400 --> 19:29.880
working for someone like that.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.480
So, why did Lisa want to go into Suite 502, do you think?

19:35.520 --> 19:38.960
Well, she was excited, you know.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.720
If you ask me, she was meeting someone.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.280
Are you sure?

19:42.320 --> 19:44.840
I've worked in hotels a long time.

19:42.320 --> 19:44.840
I know the look.

20:03.680 --> 20:07.400
So, in lieu of any kind of database, if we wish to

20:03.680 --> 20:07.400
coordinate the case,

20:07.440 --> 20:10.400
we're going to have to do this the old-fashioned way.

20:10.440 --> 20:15.920
Suspect, means, motive

20:15.960 --> 20:19.000
and opportunity. Now, as far as I can see,

20:19.040 --> 20:22.040
anyone on the fifth floor could have killed Lisa,

20:22.080 --> 20:26.880
then got back to their room unseen before Diana

20:22.080 --> 20:26.880
started screaming.

20:26.920 --> 20:29.320
They all had opportunity.

20:29.360 --> 20:31.040
Um, but not the parents, though.

20:31.080 --> 20:32.840
They'd have had to get past William in the kitchen

20:35.320 --> 20:38.320
You see, William, was whizzing up

20:35.320 --> 20:38.320
a cocktail in the blender.

20:38.360 --> 20:41.760
He'd have had his back to the door. It would've

20:38.360 --> 20:41.760
been noisy as hell.

20:41.800 --> 20:46.000
I'm sure either Mike or Diana could have

20:41.800 --> 20:46.000
slipped out and back unnoticed

20:46.040 --> 20:49.920
if they were daring enough. No,

20:46.040 --> 20:49.920
they all remain as suspects.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.280
So, means.

20:53.320 --> 20:56.720
I guess any one of them could have stolen

20:53.320 --> 20:56.720
the speargun from the hotel.

20:56.760 --> 20:58.000
Good.

21:00.640 --> 21:03.920
It's motive. That's what we're missing.

21:03.960 --> 21:06.320
Who'd want Lisa dead on her wedding day?

21:06.360 --> 21:09.760
And who'd want to kill her with a speargun?

21:09.800 --> 21:11.680
-Well... -Yes!

21:11.720 --> 21:13.840
-None of them. -Oh, that's very helpful,

21:11.720 --> 21:13.840
thank you.

21:13.880 --> 21:15.720
No, but this is the thing.

21:15.760 --> 21:18.280
I can't see any parent wanting to kill their daughter on

21:15.760 --> 21:18.280
her wedding day.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.280
Diana's only her stepmother. Remember that.

21:20.320 --> 21:24.240
But even so. And Darren,

21:20.320 --> 21:24.240
he just married Lisa.

21:24.280 --> 21:27.160
What kind of person would kill their wife only minutes

21:24.280 --> 21:27.160
after marrying her?

21:27.200 --> 21:29.120
Uh, a murderer?

21:29.160 --> 21:31.520
He's right, Chief. Who'd kill a bride?

21:31.560 --> 21:33.920
One of this lot! Okay?

21:33.960 --> 21:36.640
And it's our job to find them and bring them to justice.

21:36.680 --> 21:39.040
Now, leads. Come on, what have we got?

21:41.240 --> 21:44.440
Oh, gosh, still me, is it? Okay,

21:41.240 --> 21:44.440
right, look, how about this?

21:44.480 --> 21:49.000
The maid said that Lisa was meeting

21:44.480 --> 21:49.000
someone in Suite 502. Who?

21:49.680 --> 21:51.520
Anyone?

21:51.560 --> 21:53.320
Adam could be the obvious choice,

21:53.360 --> 21:55.360
as she was whispering to him in the lift.

21:55.400 --> 21:58.200
But Lisa can't have known that a maid was going to leave

21:55.400 --> 21:58.200
a spare suite free

21:58.240 --> 22:00.800
at that exact moment, so how did she

21:58.240 --> 22:00.800
arrange a meeting?

22:00.840 --> 22:02.840
Did she have a mobile phone on her

22:00.840 --> 22:02.840
when she was killed?

22:02.880 --> 22:04.520
No, sir.

22:04.560 --> 22:06.360
Why not use the phone in the suite?

22:06.400 --> 22:10.040
Okay, so she uses an internal phone

22:06.400 --> 22:10.040
to make the call and then?

22:10.080 --> 22:11.480
Her murderer arrives.

22:14.160 --> 22:15.600
But who?

22:20.120 --> 22:22.640
Have we heard back from DCI Halliwell?

22:22.680 --> 22:25.480
He said he'd ring back. When the office opened.

22:25.520 --> 22:28.080
Hmm.

22:28.120 --> 22:31.280
Oh, it's late. Maybe we should pick up again in the morning.

22:32.520 --> 22:33.760
Thanks, Chief.

22:38.520 --> 22:41.280
You know, back in London, we'd have a second team,

22:41.320 --> 22:43.280
working throughout the night,

22:43.320 --> 22:46.800
getting exclusion prints from all the suspects and...

22:46.840 --> 22:49.680
That's what we need but, um...

22:49.720 --> 22:51.520
...it's not what we've got, is it?

22:51.560 --> 22:52.920
You've got me, sir.

22:54.560 --> 22:57.440
Yeah, I know, Fidel.

22:57.480 --> 23:01.120
Go home. We'll start again tomorrow.

23:01.160 --> 23:05.680
If we're looking for motive, it has to be love. Or hate.

23:05.720 --> 23:08.320
It's a<i> crime passionnel.</i> A woman killed on

23:05.720 --> 23:08.320
her wedding day?

23:08.360 --> 23:11.560
You know, that "Cleaning in Progress" label on the room's

23:08.360 --> 23:11.560
still bothering me.

23:11.600 --> 23:13.520
Because it's a mad, passionate wreckless crime.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.920
As clerical errors go, it's inexcusable.

23:15.960 --> 23:18.160
Look, can we please forget about the label?

23:18.200 --> 23:19.880
You don't make sense to me.

23:21.560 --> 23:24.080
You know, one thing's always puzzled me about weddings.

23:24.120 --> 23:26.120
Just one?

23:26.160 --> 23:29.000
You know, the whole bride throwing the bouquet thing,

23:26.160 --> 23:29.000
I just don't get it.

23:29.040 --> 23:30.240
What's to get?

23:30.280 --> 23:31.800
She just throws a bouquet, whoever catches it...

23:31.840 --> 23:33.280
Yeah. No, I understand the mechanics,

23:33.320 --> 23:36.000
it's just, who'd come up with a system of matrimony

23:36.040 --> 23:38.160
based on the random distribution of flowers?

23:39.640 --> 23:41.920
Okay, so the murderer, you know who I think did it?

23:41.960 --> 23:43.880
-The butler, of course.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.880
It's always the butler.

23:45.920 --> 23:49.400
But how did William kill her and why? How does he

23:45.920 --> 23:49.400
benefit from her death?

23:49.440 --> 23:51.520
He only met Lisa for the first time

23:49.440 --> 23:51.520
three days ago,

23:51.560 --> 23:53.320
what possible motive could he have to kill her?

23:53.360 --> 23:55.440
You don't really do banter, do you?

23:58.440 --> 24:00.120
Well, I appreciate the gesture,

24:00.160 --> 24:02.960
but there's no way this is going to be

24:00.160 --> 24:02.960
a decent cup of tea.

24:03.560 --> 24:04.720
Look.

24:06.240 --> 24:07.880
French.

24:10.040 --> 24:11.400
Why did you bring him here?

24:11.440 --> 24:13.600


24:17.160 --> 24:21.080
I'm so sorry, I would of course love... Uh...

24:21.120 --> 24:23.840
Madame Bordey, how do you do? Thank you so much for the tea.

24:23.880 --> 24:26.120
Uh, sorry, Camille, would you pass the sugar?

24:26.160 --> 24:28.520
Actually it's fine.  I'll do that.

24:28.560 --> 24:32.680
Um, wow! Fantastic! Oh, look at that.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.280
Mmm!

24:44.520 --> 24:45.840
Mmm!

24:46.440 --> 24:47.680
Ah!

24:50.040 --> 24:52.000
Delicious. Ah!

25:00.440 --> 25:02.600
Doesn't your mother dance?

25:02.640 --> 25:04.040
Not like that.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.200
-Come on. -No, no, no, I'm fine.

25:09.240 --> 25:11.800
-Come on! -No,

25:09.240 --> 25:11.800
no, I'm enjoying my beverage.

25:36.400 --> 25:37.760
Shoo.

25:38.560 --> 25:40.280
Shoo! Shoo!

25:56.040 --> 25:57.480
RICHARD: Hello?

26:00.280 --> 26:02.160
Anyone?

26:02.200 --> 26:04.000
He's asleep.

26:05.200 --> 26:07.280
How do you explain being asleep on the job?

26:07.320 --> 26:10.840
You said you needed a second crime scene team working

26:07.320 --> 26:10.840
through the night.

26:10.880 --> 26:12.440
Well, Fidel took you at your word.

26:12.480 --> 26:15.480
Going back to the hotel and fingerprinting everyone

26:15.520 --> 26:17.240
who could have touched the speargun.

26:17.280 --> 26:19.880
-Ah! Well, that's, uh... -And dusting

26:17.280 --> 26:19.880
the murder weapon.

26:19.920 --> 26:22.000
Getting eight clear prints from it.

26:22.040 --> 26:25.360
And he's identified every last one of them.

26:25.400 --> 26:27.040
You're kidding me. How?

26:30.320 --> 26:33.560
No. Fidel, you're a genius! Thank you!

26:33.600 --> 26:35.160
Then whose fingerprints were on the speargun?

26:35.200 --> 26:37.000
Well, that's the thing, sir.

26:37.040 --> 26:39.640
All eight prints on the speargun

26:37.040 --> 26:39.640
belong to the same person.

26:39.680 --> 26:41.040
Who?

26:41.080 --> 26:43.640
Stefan, sir. The diving instructor.

26:52.200 --> 26:55.920
Where exactly were you when Lisa was

26:52.200 --> 26:55.920
killed yesterday?

26:55.960 --> 26:58.160
I was off in the groves collecting driftwood to carve.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.080
-No, I was on my own.

27:00.120 --> 27:04.000
So, you don't have an alibi for the time of Lisa's murder.

27:04.040 --> 27:06.280
Why were only your fingerprints

27:04.040 --> 27:06.280
on the murder weapon?

27:06.320 --> 27:07.960
Well, the speargun was stolen from my diving...

27:08.000 --> 27:10.040
You're missing the point, Stefan.

27:10.080 --> 27:12.960
The only fingerprints we found on the murder

27:10.080 --> 27:12.960
weapon were yours.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.320
No one else touched it.

27:16.360 --> 27:19.920
This is crazy. I met her once. What reason could

27:16.360 --> 27:19.920
I have to kill her?

27:24.120 --> 27:25.600
CAMILLE: If it was Stefan,

27:25.640 --> 27:28.440
how did he get himself and his speargun

27:25.640 --> 27:28.440
up to the fifth floor?

27:28.480 --> 27:32.120
And like he said, why would he kill a bride

27:28.480 --> 27:32.120
he'd only met once?

27:34.040 --> 27:38.080
Ah! Thank you. Look, Stefan's involved,

27:34.040 --> 27:38.080
you mark my words.

27:38.120 --> 27:39.760
We just have to find out how.

27:39.800 --> 27:41.880
The autopsy report's in.

27:41.920 --> 27:45.240
The bolt ruptured Lisa's heart. She was dead before

27:41.920 --> 27:45.240
she hit the rocks.

27:45.280 --> 27:47.760
-This letter. -Ah!

27:47.800 --> 27:50.000
Now, I want you two to watch Stefan.

27:50.040 --> 27:52.720
See if he has any contact with anyone

27:50.040 --> 27:52.720
in the wedding party.

27:52.760 --> 27:54.760
Uh, looks like you were right, Dwayne.

27:54.800 --> 27:57.720
Just before she was killed, Lisa made a phone call from

27:54.800 --> 27:57.720
the murder room.

27:57.760 --> 27:58.920
Who did she call?

27:58.960 --> 28:00.840
Room 503.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.120
Adam Fairs.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.560
Okay, what now?

28:08.600 --> 28:11.200
Oh, just a few more questions, Mr Fairs.

28:11.240 --> 28:14.600
We've seen the CCTV footage from the lift,

28:11.240 --> 28:14.600
just after the wedding...

28:14.640 --> 28:18.200
What was Lisa whispering to you

28:14.640 --> 28:18.200
as you returned to your rooms?

28:18.240 --> 28:20.320
I don't remember any, uh, whispering.

28:20.360 --> 28:22.320
But you were planning to meet her in secret.

28:22.360 --> 28:23.720
What?

28:23.760 --> 28:26.120
Lisa rang your room shortly after the ceremony.

28:26.160 --> 28:28.200
No.

28:28.240 --> 28:31.320
Are you denying that Lisa phoned your room just

28:28.240 --> 28:31.320
before she was killed?

28:31.360 --> 28:33.200
Well, if she did, I didn't hear it.

28:33.240 --> 28:35.080
Were you having an affair?

28:35.120 --> 28:37.560
What?

28:37.600 --> 28:40.200
She just married my best mate, what's wrong with you people?

28:40.240 --> 28:43.960
Would you rather we show the CCTV footage

28:40.240 --> 28:43.960
to your best mate?

28:44.000 --> 28:46.080
See what he thinks about it?

28:46.120 --> 28:47.560
You can do what you like.

28:48.400 --> 28:49.680
Okay.

28:52.800 --> 28:56.520
Four, three, two...

28:56.560 --> 28:58.000
Wait!

28:59.520 --> 29:02.280
Okay, all right, I was...

29:02.320 --> 29:04.000
I was arranging to meet with Lisa.

29:05.520 --> 29:08.720
So, why were you arranging to meet her in secret?

29:08.760 --> 29:13.280
I, uh, wanted to borrow some money and, uh,

29:08.760 --> 29:13.280
her stepmum's a control freak

29:13.320 --> 29:15.840
and Darren had already warned me off, so...

29:15.880 --> 29:17.760
we had to do it without any of them knowing.

29:17.800 --> 29:19.200
That's what she was telling me in the lift,

29:19.240 --> 29:22.040
that she'd meet me when she could get away,

29:22.080 --> 29:23.920
but it never happened.

29:23.960 --> 29:25.840
-I've got a car business,

29:25.880 --> 29:28.600
but I need to find 50 grand by the end of the month or...

29:28.640 --> 29:30.360
Or what?

29:30.400 --> 29:32.320
I won't have a car business.

29:32.360 --> 29:35.680
And where did you think she was going to get that

29:32.360 --> 29:35.680
kind of money from?

29:35.720 --> 29:38.320
Lis? She's loaded.

29:38.360 --> 29:40.640
-Or at least her

29:38.360 --> 29:40.640
mum was loaded.

29:40.680 --> 29:42.880
When she died, she left it all

29:40.680 --> 29:42.880
in trust to Lisa.

29:42.920 --> 29:45.760
And when did Lisa get control of the trust fund?

29:45.800 --> 29:48.600
Well, that's just it. Her parents

29:45.800 --> 29:48.600
always controlled it.

29:48.640 --> 29:50.200
She inherited everything on her wedding day.

29:52.800 --> 29:55.720
Looks like we have our motive. Money.

29:55.760 --> 29:59.240
But for whom? The parents who

29:55.760 --> 29:59.240
lost everything,

29:59.280 --> 30:03.080
the best man about to lose his business

29:59.280 --> 30:03.080
or the new husband?

30:04.360 --> 30:06.720
Who gets her cash now she's dead?

30:12.000 --> 30:14.720
We're sorry to intrude, but we need to ask

30:12.000 --> 30:14.720
a few more questions.

30:14.760 --> 30:16.520
We'll do anything we can to help.

30:17.040 --> 30:18.800
Thank you.

30:18.840 --> 30:21.520
Can I ask, was your wife going to lend Adam Fairs

30:18.840 --> 30:21.520
the money he needed?

30:21.560 --> 30:24.720
-You've been speaking to Adam.

30:24.760 --> 30:27.160
RICHARD: He'd asked to borrow £50,000, hadn't he?

30:28.680 --> 30:30.640
Don't worry,

30:30.680 --> 30:32.760
she wasn't going to lend it to him.

30:35.680 --> 30:39.240
We... We argued about it the night before the wedding.

30:39.280 --> 30:41.240
You know, I've known Adam

30:39.280 --> 30:41.240
since I was a kid.

30:41.280 --> 30:43.840
He's a great guy but you don't lend him money, not if you

30:41.280 --> 30:43.840
want to see it again.

30:43.880 --> 30:46.280
Everybody gets written off, don't they,

30:43.880 --> 30:46.280
if they don't have any money?

30:46.320 --> 30:48.280
-No. -God forbid have to

30:46.320 --> 30:48.280
work for a living.

30:48.320 --> 30:51.440
Sally. This is neither the time nor place.

30:51.480 --> 30:53.280
But that's all we talk about.

30:53.320 --> 30:56.080
Lisa and her money and her beauty, oh!

30:56.120 --> 30:58.360
And her wedding goes without a hitch.

30:58.400 --> 31:01.760
And now she's dead, she's all we're ever going to talk

30:58.400 --> 31:01.760
about, isn't she?

31:01.800 --> 31:06.520
And we're going to get older and she's going to stay

31:01.800 --> 31:06.520
young and perfect.

31:06.560 --> 31:07.960
And married.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.920
MIKE: Sally!

31:14.040 --> 31:16.760
I'm sorry, Darren, but I still need to ask.

31:16.800 --> 31:19.280
In the event of Lisa's death, do you inherit her fortune?

31:23.440 --> 31:26.080
Dwayne, why did you tell the chief

31:23.440 --> 31:26.080
I worked through the night

31:26.120 --> 31:27.520
on my own?

31:28.720 --> 31:30.320
Don't you want to be in with him?

31:30.360 --> 31:33.240
Of course, yes, but it's not true.

31:33.280 --> 31:35.760
It was you and me, Dwayne. We did it all together.

31:35.800 --> 31:39.960
I don't understand. Why don't you want

31:35.800 --> 31:39.960
your boss to know?

31:40.000 --> 31:42.520
Once they know you're willing to help...

31:46.360 --> 31:49.560
Um, Stefan, he's over there.

31:50.480 --> 31:51.920
I know.

31:59.040 --> 32:00.720
Sally's right, you know.

32:00.760 --> 32:02.920
Lisa's money, it distorts

32:00.760 --> 32:02.920
everything in this family.

32:02.960 --> 32:04.600
It's why we signed this.

32:04.640 --> 32:07.160
-It's a prenuptial agreement.

32:07.200 --> 32:09.760
We signed it the night before our wedding.

32:09.800 --> 32:13.040
If Lisa and I were to divorce or if she died,

32:13.080 --> 32:16.040
even if she left me for another man,

32:13.080 --> 32:16.040
it makes no difference,

32:16.080 --> 32:18.120
I get nothing.

32:18.160 --> 32:21.040
When my wife died, I lost everything. And I'm not

32:18.160 --> 32:21.040
talking about money.

32:23.160 --> 32:25.040
Why don't you talk them through it, Diana?

32:29.120 --> 32:30.760
I don't know what he's talking about.

32:30.800 --> 32:34.120
-It was our idea. -Yes,

32:30.800 --> 32:34.120
and we did the right thing.

32:36.280 --> 32:38.040
And don't you judge us.

32:38.080 --> 32:41.240
Darren's reputation is that he beds any girl with a pulse.

32:41.280 --> 32:45.000
We had to make sure that he wasn't

32:41.280 --> 32:45.000
after Lisa's money.

32:45.040 --> 32:46.720
So we merely suggested...

32:46.760 --> 32:51.120
We didn't just suggest, we got our lawyers to

32:46.760 --> 32:51.120
draw up a contract.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.840
Didn't we, dear?

32:58.120 --> 33:00.640
FIDEL: Does Stefan only teach women in bikinis?

33:02.840 --> 33:04.200
I hope so.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.960
You know, if it had been up to Lisa,

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
she would have given every penny

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
of her money away.

33:20.040 --> 33:22.680
She was scared it was going to

33:20.040 --> 33:22.680
come between us.

33:22.720 --> 33:24.400
Hmm.

33:24.440 --> 33:26.840
So, with the prenuptial agreement

33:24.440 --> 33:26.840
in place,

33:26.880 --> 33:29.600
the next of kin would be... -It's what Lisa wanted.

33:32.400 --> 33:33.800
Excuse me?

33:33.840 --> 33:36.480
-Oh, she hasn't signed it. -But we watched her.

33:36.520 --> 33:40.360
In the signature box she's written,

33:36.520 --> 33:40.360
"I'm not signing this, Darren.

33:40.400 --> 33:43.800
"When are you going to get it? I love you till

33:40.400 --> 33:43.800
death do us part."

33:50.200 --> 33:53.520
I think you've just inherited your wife's fortune after all.

33:55.080 --> 33:57.320
So you've been manipulating us from the start?

33:57.360 --> 33:58.720
-No, I... -Liar!

33:58.760 --> 34:00.880
-He's tricked us. -Diana, not here, not now.

34:08.440 --> 34:10.960
Terrified of losing their lifestyle,

34:11.000 --> 34:13.480
Mr and Mrs Watson murdered their daughter

34:13.520 --> 34:14.880
to steal her inheritance.

34:14.920 --> 34:18.720
Realising she'd failed to sign the prenuptial.

34:18.760 --> 34:20.960
So, it's Darren who inherits after all.

34:25.880 --> 34:28.160
This is a major breakthrough. The money, the contract...

34:28.200 --> 34:30.520
Yeah, but why kill Lisa on her wedding day?

34:30.560 --> 34:33.640
Why not wait

34:36.880 --> 34:40.680
I understand the bride and groom had an argument the

34:36.880 --> 34:40.680
night before the wedding?

34:40.720 --> 34:44.400
I bet nothing happens on this floor

34:40.720 --> 34:44.400
you don't know about.

34:44.440 --> 34:46.920
Now you come to mention it, I think I did

34:44.440 --> 34:46.920
hear raised voices.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.680
And did you hear what the argument was about?

34:51.520 --> 34:54.000
It was, uh...

34:54.040 --> 34:55.960
...difficult to make out, but I think it may have been

34:56.000 --> 34:59.120
something to do with Margaret, the maid, sir.

34:59.160 --> 35:01.600
It wasn't very clear, but I'm sure I heard her name.

35:01.640 --> 35:03.120
Hmm.

35:03.160 --> 35:06.680
What was it Diana said? "Darren beds any

35:03.160 --> 35:06.680
girl with a pulse"?

35:06.720 --> 35:09.280
Is that what you're suggesting, that Darren and

35:06.720 --> 35:09.280
Margaret were...

35:09.320 --> 35:11.040
I wouldn't know, sir.

35:14.920 --> 35:17.320
RICHARD: Isn't anyone in this family

35:14.920 --> 35:17.320
honest about anything?

35:17.360 --> 35:21.120
Sex and money. The root of all evil.

35:37.440 --> 35:40.800
You must think we're a right bunch.

35:40.840 --> 35:44.080
Families are notoriously, uh, complicated.

35:50.640 --> 35:52.160
Could I ask you something?

35:52.200 --> 35:55.560
Sally said that Lisa's wedding had gone off without a hitch,

35:55.600 --> 35:59.040
with the emphasis on the word "Lisa's".

35:55.600 --> 35:59.040
Just an odd phrase, no?

35:59.080 --> 36:00.800
What exactly did she mean by it?

36:04.080 --> 36:06.960
About a year ago, Sally got engaged to a...

36:07.000 --> 36:11.280
Well, Diana reckoned he was after the family money.

36:15.160 --> 36:18.320
I'm ashamed to say, we offered him

36:15.160 --> 36:18.320
money to disappear.

36:18.360 --> 36:20.720
I did it expecting him to refuse,

36:20.760 --> 36:23.720
to prove to Diana that it wasn't true.

36:23.760 --> 36:25.600
CAMILLE: But he took it?

36:25.640 --> 36:29.760
So, you used Lisa's money to drive her

36:25.640 --> 36:29.760
sister's fiance away?

36:29.800 --> 36:32.480
-Diana couldn't

36:29.800 --> 36:32.480
wait to tell her.

36:32.520 --> 36:35.160
Truth is she's never forgiven us.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.280
Okay, so yesterday, I asked for motive.

36:44.880 --> 36:46.560
Mike and Diana.

36:46.600 --> 36:48.840
Mmm, I don't believe it was the father,

36:46.600 --> 36:48.840
but the wife,

36:48.880 --> 36:52.720
she's obsessed with money that she lost control of

36:48.880 --> 36:52.720
the moment Lisa got married.

36:52.760 --> 36:55.880
Ah, but what if Darren knew she hadn't signed the prenup?

36:55.920 --> 36:57.720
Actually, that's my own personal...

36:57.760 --> 37:00.880
Then maybe it's something to do with the

36:57.760 --> 37:00.880
argument he and Lisa had

37:00.920 --> 37:03.320
-Brought it all

37:00.920 --> 37:03.320
the way from England.

37:03.360 --> 37:06.800
Hmm, what about Adam?

37:06.840 --> 37:10.920
He needs Lisa's money. What if she

37:06.840 --> 37:10.920
refused to help him?

37:10.960 --> 37:14.040
Which only leaves us Sally, who doesn't have

37:10.960 --> 37:14.040
the motive of money.

37:14.080 --> 37:16.120
-Any of these... -But if we're looking for

37:16.160 --> 37:18.120
a desperate and sick murderer,

37:18.160 --> 37:22.200
who better than the jilted stepsister, who waits until

37:18.160 --> 37:22.200
Lisa's wedding day

37:22.240 --> 37:24.320
and then strikes?

37:24.360 --> 37:26.640
Mind you, don't forget about Stefan.

37:26.680 --> 37:28.520
This isn't working.

37:28.560 --> 37:32.600
-Stefan... -Yes,

37:28.560 --> 37:32.600
Stefan has to be involved.

37:32.640 --> 37:34.680
It's the only thing that explains the speargun.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.760
...he likes the ladies but...

37:37.800 --> 37:40.200
Honore Police Station.

37:40.240 --> 37:41.960
He didn't go anywhere near the wedding party.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.160
Hmm. Sorry, do you mind?

37:44.200 --> 37:46.880
It's the hotel. There's been another murder.

37:58.360 --> 38:00.280
Can we have some light, please?

38:15.880 --> 38:18.320
An English bride is killed on her wedding day.

38:18.360 --> 38:22.080
Then the maid that cleaned the room

38:18.360 --> 38:22.080
is herself killed. Why?

38:44.280 --> 38:47.640
Margaret said something about having been

38:44.280 --> 38:47.640
in trouble before.

38:47.680 --> 38:51.440
Is that right? What sort of

38:47.680 --> 38:51.440
trouble had she been in?

38:51.480 --> 38:54.600
Well, it was never proven, but at one time

38:51.480 --> 38:54.600
William suspected

38:54.640 --> 38:59.800
that Margaret was using spare VIP suites

38:54.640 --> 38:59.800
for romantic assignations.

38:59.840 --> 39:01.560
Hmm, of course.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.880
And he thought that she used the "Cleaning in

39:01.600 --> 39:03.880
Progress" label

39:03.920 --> 39:07.000
on the door as a sign for the person she was meeting.

39:10.160 --> 39:12.600
Do you think she was using the room

39:10.160 --> 39:12.600
to have sex with guests?

39:12.640 --> 39:15.160
I don't know. These are just

39:12.640 --> 39:15.160
William's suspicions.

39:15.200 --> 39:18.320
Margaret was very popular and I never

39:15.200 --> 39:18.320
found any evidence.

39:19.600 --> 39:21.080
Darren?

39:53.600 --> 39:55.440
What are you doing?

40:05.000 --> 40:07.080
How quickly do those lift doors open?

40:10.920 --> 40:12.720
Uh, pretty quickly.

40:12.760 --> 40:15.160
Could you open Suite 502, please?

40:15.200 --> 40:18.440
MARGARET: <i>I'd just finished my work</i>

40:15.200 --> 40:18.440
<i>and I went back to Room 502.</i>

40:18.480 --> 40:21.080
<i>I opened the door</i> <i>and that's when she came out.</i>

40:21.120 --> 40:22.960
Margaret! Margaret!

40:23.000 --> 40:24.360
And now the phone rings.

40:36.920 --> 40:38.200
-It's Lisa!

40:38.240 --> 40:39.760
Come down!

40:39.800 --> 40:42.560
WILLIAM: <i>I was making cocktails</i>

40:39.800 --> 40:42.560
<i>when I heard Mrs Watson.</i>

40:42.600 --> 40:45.040
ADAM:<i> All right, I was...</i> <i>I was arranging</i>

40:42.600 --> 40:45.040
<i>to meet with Lisa.</i>

40:45.080 --> 40:47.880
STEFAN:<i> This is crazy! I met</i> <i>her once. What reason could</i>

40:45.080 --> 40:47.880
<i>I have to kill her?</i>

40:47.920 --> 40:49.760
MIKE:<i> I'm ashamed to say</i> <i>we offered him money...</i>

40:49.800 --> 40:52.840
DARREN:<i> We argued about it</i> <i>the night before the wedding.</i>

40:53.240 --> 40:54.640
Ah!

40:58.120 --> 41:00.160
I want you to gather everyone, Stefan included.

41:00.200 --> 41:01.400
Where?

41:01.440 --> 41:04.040
The veranda to begin with, I think.

41:04.080 --> 41:06.800
In precisely 11 minutes.

41:16.600 --> 41:18.320
You're coming with us.

41:25.320 --> 41:26.560
No.

41:27.680 --> 41:30.200
Uh, there's been another murder.

41:30.240 --> 41:34.720
The maid, Margaret, who cleaned the room

41:30.240 --> 41:34.720
where the murder took place.

41:36.840 --> 41:39.200
She's been found dead. Strangled.

41:39.240 --> 41:40.800
Well, surely you're not suggesting...

41:40.840 --> 41:43.360
First, let's return to the death

41:40.840 --> 41:43.360
of Lisa Moore.

41:45.200 --> 41:47.040
Adam, you wanted to borrow money from her.

41:47.080 --> 41:50.440
-Yeah, but I didn't know if she was...

41:47.080 --> 41:50.440
-Ah... Well, I do.

41:53.480 --> 41:55.920
She was going to give you every penny you needed.

41:55.960 --> 41:58.880
Darren here told her it was a bad idea

41:58.920 --> 42:01.040
and she was wise enough to keep the whole enterprise

42:01.080 --> 42:03.920
a secret from her parents, particularly her stepmother.

42:03.960 --> 42:08.080
But I think as Lisa came into her money

42:03.960 --> 42:08.080
when she married,

42:08.120 --> 42:11.040
she couldn't wait finally to show who was boss.

42:11.080 --> 42:13.920
She'd already said that she'd meet you

42:11.080 --> 42:13.920
when she got the chance.

42:13.960 --> 42:16.080
That's what she was telling me in the lift,

42:16.120 --> 42:18.600
that she'd call when she could get away,

42:16.120 --> 42:18.600
but it never happened.

42:18.640 --> 42:20.960
So, when she came across an empty room,

42:21.000 --> 42:23.040
it was too good an opportunity to miss.

42:23.080 --> 42:24.800
Yeah, but how do you know it was me

42:23.080 --> 42:24.800
she wanted to meet?

42:24.840 --> 42:26.200
Because just before Lisa was killed,

42:26.240 --> 42:28.720
a call was placed from the suite she was in to yours.

42:28.760 --> 42:29.920
-But... -I know.

42:29.960 --> 42:31.360
A phone call you say you never got.

42:31.400 --> 42:33.840
-I-I... -Yeah, that puzzled me, too.

42:33.880 --> 42:36.760
Then I remembered, you didn't tell us

42:33.880 --> 42:36.760
where you were, Sally did.

42:36.800 --> 42:39.760
Look, I was in my room. Adam was in his room.

42:36.800 --> 42:39.760
Darren...

42:39.800 --> 42:41.760
I don't know, but you should be out there

42:41.800 --> 42:43.960
looking for Lisa's killer, not just standing

42:41.800 --> 42:43.960
around here chatting.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.640
RICHARD:<i> And having done so,</i> <i>she then apologised.</i>

42:46.680 --> 42:48.360
Well, answer it! I'm sorry.

42:50.120 --> 42:52.600
I thought at the time she was apologising to

42:50.120 --> 42:52.600
the room in general,

42:52.640 --> 42:55.640
but she was actually just apologising to you.

42:55.680 --> 42:57.840
'Cause she'd just lied about your whereabouts.

42:57.880 --> 42:59.840
Why would she lie about his whereabouts?

42:59.880 --> 43:02.440
Because Adam was in Sally's room.

43:05.040 --> 43:08.760
CAMILLE:<i> I saw you, Adam,</i> <i>comforting Sally by the pool.</i>

43:08.800 --> 43:11.200
You're lovers, aren't you?

43:11.240 --> 43:14.880
And Adam wasn't allowed to tell anyone

43:11.240 --> 43:14.880
under any circumstances.

43:14.920 --> 43:16.320
Well, how do you know all this?

43:16.360 --> 43:18.440
Because the last time Sally was in a relationship,

43:18.480 --> 43:20.120
engaged to be married,

43:20.160 --> 43:22.120
you thought her fiance was a gold-digger

43:22.160 --> 43:24.120
and offered him money to leave.

43:24.160 --> 43:26.800
What would you have thought of Sally's

43:24.160 --> 43:26.800
relationship with Adam,

43:26.840 --> 43:28.800
because he really needs money?

43:28.840 --> 43:31.600
-But if these two were together...

43:28.840 --> 43:31.600
-RICHARD: Precisely.

43:31.640 --> 43:36.520
If Sally and Adam were together, then they have

43:31.640 --> 43:36.520
an alibi after all.

43:36.560 --> 43:39.440
And as Mr and Mrs Watson and William

43:36.560 --> 43:39.440
were all in their suite,

43:39.480 --> 43:43.120
that leaves only you without an alibi.

43:43.160 --> 43:46.160
You've already admitted you argued with Lisa the night

43:43.160 --> 43:46.160
before you got married.

43:46.200 --> 43:47.320
-Yes. -You said it was about

43:47.360 --> 43:49.160
lending money to Adam Fairs.

43:49.200 --> 43:51.080
CAMILLE: Or was it something else?

43:51.120 --> 43:52.880
What?

43:52.920 --> 43:54.800
Are your philandering days really over, Mr Moore?

43:54.840 --> 43:56.120
Yes!

43:56.160 --> 43:59.440
When I met Lisa, there never was anyone else.

43:59.480 --> 44:01.720
There never will be anyone else.

44:05.120 --> 44:07.440
Ah! Stefan!

44:11.280 --> 44:14.960
Now we're all here, perhaps you'd like to

44:11.280 --> 44:14.960
join me in Suite 502.

44:21.600 --> 44:25.360
Please, enough of this. Who killed my daughter?

44:25.400 --> 44:27.520
Your daughter was killed by the only person here

44:27.560 --> 44:30.920
with the means, motive and opportunity.

44:30.960 --> 44:32.720
Mrs Watson,

44:32.760 --> 44:35.400
if you were on your balcony, as you said you were,

44:35.440 --> 44:37.240
looking at the view, when your

44:35.440 --> 44:37.240
stepdaughter was killed...

44:37.280 --> 44:39.800
-But I was. -Did you have your

44:37.280 --> 44:39.800
back to the room?

44:39.840 --> 44:41.720
I don't know, I mean, I...

44:42.280 --> 44:44.200
Maybe.

44:44.240 --> 44:46.400
Then you couldn't have seen who came or went from the

44:44.240 --> 44:46.400
room, could you?

44:47.240 --> 44:50.200
Um... No, I suppose not.

44:50.240 --> 44:53.080
So, that leaves you, Mr Watson. You claimed you

44:50.240 --> 44:53.080
were in your bedroom.

44:53.120 --> 44:56.240
Huh? Well, yes, I was.

44:59.640 --> 45:01.880
William, you tell him. You were there.

44:59.640 --> 45:01.880
You were in the kitchen.

45:01.920 --> 45:03.360
You would have seen me if I'd left the suite.

45:03.400 --> 45:04.840
RICHARD: But would he?

45:04.880 --> 45:06.680
You see, this is what I

45:04.880 --> 45:06.680
finally realised.

45:06.720 --> 45:08.760
You know, we've been

45:06.720 --> 45:08.760
looking at this case

45:08.800 --> 45:10.440
the wrong way round from the start.

45:10.480 --> 45:14.080
'Cause when you flip everything,

45:10.480 --> 45:14.080
then and only then

45:14.120 --> 45:15.560
does it make sense.

45:15.600 --> 45:18.440
Starting with the ending and working back

45:15.600 --> 45:18.440
to the beginning.

45:18.480 --> 45:20.360
I mean, um, take the alibis.

45:20.400 --> 45:22.960
William says that he can alibi you, that he didn't see

45:20.400 --> 45:22.960
you leave the suite,

45:23.000 --> 45:24.880
well, fair enough, maybe he didn't.

45:24.920 --> 45:27.640
But, um, whether or not he can alibi you,

45:27.680 --> 45:29.600
in what way can you alibi him?

45:30.720 --> 45:32.400
That's right, isn't it, William?

45:32.440 --> 45:34.920
You murdered Lisa and then you

45:32.440 --> 45:34.920
murdered Margaret the maid.

45:38.280 --> 45:39.840
I'm sorry, sir?

45:39.880 --> 45:44.640
We've always presumed this case

45:39.880 --> 45:44.640
was about Lisa,

45:44.680 --> 45:47.680
because, well, it's impossible to ignore the drama of a bride

45:47.720 --> 45:51.280
killed on her wedding day, but this has

45:47.720 --> 45:51.280
never been about Lisa.

45:51.320 --> 45:54.000
This has always been about you and your

45:51.320 --> 45:54.000
obsession with Margaret.

45:54.040 --> 45:56.480
She even told us as much when we interviewed her.

45:56.520 --> 46:00.080
The butler on that floor, William,

45:56.520 --> 46:00.080
he's always on my case.

46:00.120 --> 46:03.080
But Margaret already had a boyfriend, didn't she?

46:03.120 --> 46:06.280
That's why when she was given a lucky rose from

46:03.120 --> 46:06.280
a bride's bouquet,

46:06.320 --> 46:08.760
she kept it.

46:08.800 --> 46:11.680
And the man Margaret was in love with

46:08.800 --> 46:11.680
was you, Stefan, wasn't it?

46:11.720 --> 46:13.120
Margaret was the girlfriend you referred to.

46:13.160 --> 46:15.080
I'm sorry for your loss.

46:15.120 --> 46:17.680
So, you, William,

46:17.720 --> 46:20.720
decided if you couldn't have Margaret to yourself,

46:20.760 --> 46:23.200
that you'd kill her and frame her

46:20.760 --> 46:23.200
boyfriend for her murder,

46:23.240 --> 46:26.440
which finally answers the question,

46:23.240 --> 46:26.440
"Why a speargun?" Because it's the one thing

46:26.480 --> 46:29.680
that would incriminate Stefan.

46:29.720 --> 46:31.160
<i>It's</i> <i>the advantage of your job,</i>

46:29.720 --> 46:31.160
<i>isn't it?</i>

46:31.200 --> 46:33.480
<i>That you're</i> <i>essentially invisible.</i>

46:33.520 --> 46:37.320
<i>And you're always wearing</i> <i>white gloves, so you never</i>

46:33.520 --> 46:37.320
<i>leave any fingerprints.</i>

46:37.360 --> 46:40.320
You knew the significance of Margaret's

46:37.360 --> 46:40.320
"Cleaning in Progress" label,

46:40.360 --> 46:42.000
so why did you say that you didn't?

46:42.040 --> 46:43.680
There's is a "Cleaning in Progress"

46:42.040 --> 46:43.680
label here.

46:43.720 --> 46:47.280
-I wouldn't know, sir.

46:47.320 --> 46:49.240
RICHARD: <i>When everyone returned</i>

46:47.320 --> 46:49.240
<i>from the wedding,</i>

46:49.280 --> 46:52.240
<i>you saw Margaret</i> <i>and her calling card</i>

46:52.280 --> 46:54.320
<i>and put your plan into action.</i>

46:54.360 --> 46:56.680
<i>I think you offered to make</i> <i>cocktails 'cause you knew</i>

46:54.360 --> 46:56.680
<i>it would involve</i>

46:56.720 --> 46:59.160
<i>an unholy amount of noise</i> <i>from a blender.</i>

47:02.320 --> 47:06.000
<i>The only problem being that</i> <i>although Margaret was</i>

47:02.320 --> 47:06.000
<i>planning to use this room,</i>

47:06.040 --> 47:08.800
<i>-Lisa got here first.</i> -Margaret! Margaret!

47:08.840 --> 47:10.560
-Oh, no, I can't.

47:10.600 --> 47:12.200
Please, I won't be long.

47:14.120 --> 47:15.520
Thank you so much.

47:17.480 --> 47:20.000
With the blender providing you with an alibi,

47:20.040 --> 47:23.400
you took the speargun from the room,

47:20.040 --> 47:23.400
left the suite

47:23.440 --> 47:27.560
and headed across the hallway and used your key to enter.

47:31.200 --> 47:33.360
Which is why I wanted you all up here

47:33.400 --> 47:36.560
in the room where Lisa was murdered at 15:10,

47:36.600 --> 47:38.400
the exact time she was killed,

47:38.440 --> 47:41.280
because there's one thing I've noticed

47:38.440 --> 47:41.280
about the Caribbean.

47:41.320 --> 47:43.280
It's sunny, isn't it?

47:43.320 --> 47:45.560
And when William came in here to commit murder,

47:45.600 --> 47:47.640
he was running from a dark corridor

47:47.680 --> 47:52.120
to a room lit by the blinding Caribbean sun!

47:52.160 --> 47:54.640
<i>William didn't see</i> <i>who was on the balcony.</i>

47:54.680 --> 47:57.000
<i>He just saw</i> <i>a figure and fired,</i>

47:54.680 --> 47:57.000
<i>didn't you?</i>

48:05.880 --> 48:07.160
You are mistaken, sir.

48:07.200 --> 48:09.960
It was a<i> crime passionnel,</i>

48:10.000 --> 48:13.200
as Camille said all along, of love and of hate.

48:13.240 --> 48:14.720
Not of Lisa.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.040
Of Margaret.

48:18.080 --> 48:21.400
You dropped the speargun, then you returned

48:18.080 --> 48:21.400
to the kitchen...

48:26.840 --> 48:28.320
switching off the blender...

48:30.760 --> 48:34.360
...just in time to re-emerge the concerned hotel employee

48:34.400 --> 48:35.520
a few seconds later.

48:38.200 --> 48:40.640
If you'd left it with Lisa's murder, I...

48:40.680 --> 48:43.000
I don't see how we could have caught you.

48:43.040 --> 48:45.920
But once you killed Margaret, I finally understood.

48:46.880 --> 48:49.360
And the fact that you strangled her,

48:49.400 --> 48:52.200
it could only be a murder driven by rage.

48:59.800 --> 49:02.360
CAMILLE:<i> You are</i> <i>not the perfect butler</i>

48:59.800 --> 49:02.360
<i>you claim to be.</i>

49:04.040 --> 49:08.400
<i>Your calm facade is just that,</i> <i>a facade.</i>

49:08.440 --> 49:11.640
Because there's a passion in your heart,

49:08.440 --> 49:11.640
isn't there, William?

49:11.680 --> 49:16.000
And like all uptight men, when you release

49:11.680 --> 49:16.000
that pent-up passion,

49:16.040 --> 49:19.080
-Camille, um...

49:19.120 --> 49:22.480
Why isn't the world ordered like you'd wish it?

49:22.520 --> 49:24.080
Why doesn't it understand you?

49:24.120 --> 49:27.160
Why don't women want you

49:27.200 --> 49:28.960
They've never wanted you.

49:38.680 --> 49:39.880
Are you okay?

49:40.440 --> 49:41.840
Thanks.

49:41.880 --> 49:44.800
Read him his rights and dump him in the cells.

49:45.960 --> 49:47.360
Good work, team.

49:55.960 --> 49:59.480
So, I solved the case, then.

49:59.520 --> 50:04.200
-Like I said,

49:59.520 --> 50:04.200
the butler did it.

50:04.240 --> 50:07.160
-Oh. -Oh, stop being so grumpy.

50:07.800 --> 50:09.480
I'm not grumpy.

50:09.520 --> 50:10.840
Okay.

50:11.400 --> 50:13.520
Prove it! What are you doing?

50:13.560 --> 50:15.680
We're on duty!

50:15.720 --> 50:18.800
But we've just caught a double murderer.

50:15.720 --> 50:18.800
Come on in!

50:18.840 --> 50:20.720
What about sharks?

50:20.760 --> 50:22.800
It's about six inches of water.

50:22.840 --> 50:24.880
Oh, I'll just step on a sea urchin or something.

50:24.920 --> 50:27.960
We're in one of the most beautiful spots

50:24.920 --> 50:27.960
on God's Earth!

50:28.000 --> 50:30.400
Come on! Take those shoes off!

50:30.440 --> 50:33.040
Yeah, but those crime reports won't write themselves,

50:30.440 --> 50:33.040
will they?

50:34.000 --> 50:36.560
I'd better get on with, um...

50:36.600 --> 50:40.440
Yeah. See you tomorrow. Uh,
