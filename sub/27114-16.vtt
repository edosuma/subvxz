{\an8}(Nina Parker)
Previously on "Love
&amp; Hip Hop: The Reunion"...

00:03.969 --> 00:06.673
{\an7}You disrespected my
mothering to my (bleep) kids.

00:06.740 --> 00:09.576
{\an8}That's not what happened.

00:09.642 --> 00:10.643
{\an8}Yo, yo, yo, yo!

00:10.710 --> 00:11.711
{\an8}Y'all buggin' out.

00:11.778 --> 00:13.313
{\an8}I saw a
communication issue

00:13.380 --> 00:15.081
{\an8}between my
partner and I.

00:15.148 --> 00:17.384
{\an8}I was like, "(bleep),"
like, I have to be honest

00:17.450 --> 00:20.587
{\an8}because that's the only
way that we're gonna get
the help that we need.

00:20.653 --> 00:22.555
{\an8}I don't want nobody even
looking at my (bleep) kid

00:22.622 --> 00:25.525
{\an8}thinking of anything,
'cause I went through that.

00:25.592 --> 00:29.496
{\an8}Unfortunately, I still
have the shrimp down there.

00:25.592 --> 00:29.496
{\an4}Oh.

00:29.562 --> 00:32.932
{\an8}I love Rich very much.
I am very much in
love with him.

00:32.999 --> 00:36.136
{\an8}Just say what you feel.

00:32.999 --> 00:36.136
{\an8}Shut the (bleep) up
and let me speak.

00:36.202 --> 00:37.337
{\an8}Sop embarrassing yourself.

00:37.404 --> 00:38.905
{\an8}I'm not embarrassing myself.

00:38.972 --> 00:41.441
{\an8}I was pregnant by Rich.
Yes, I've been all that.

00:41.508 --> 00:43.143
{\an7}All right, I'ma let
y'all have this.

00:43.209 --> 00:44.544
{\an8}Are you gonna go out there
and back me up

00:44.611 --> 00:47.046
{\an8}for once,
my (bleep), for once?

00:47.113 --> 00:48.782
{\an8}This (bleep) is crazy!

00:48.848 --> 00:50.049
{\an8}(Nina)
And tonight on part two

00:50.116 --> 00:52.485
{\an8}of "Love &amp; Hip Hop:
The Reunion"...

00:52.552 --> 00:54.487
{\an7}(imitates mockingly)
"I was an internet celebrity."

00:54.554 --> 00:57.023
{\an8}Are we doing that?

00:54.554 --> 00:57.023
{\an8}You're the biggest
train wreck

00:57.090 --> 00:58.258
{\an8}I've ever seen
in my life.

00:58.324 --> 01:00.326
{\an8}You are messy.

00:58.324 --> 01:00.326
{\an7}Yes.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.562
{\an7}Watch your (bleep) tone,
you bitch-ass (bleep).

01:02.629 --> 01:03.730
{\an8}You gonna make me
(bleep) him up. Stop.

01:03.797 --> 01:04.931
{\an8}See, I'm the type of bitch

01:04.998 --> 01:06.666
{\an8}that I may bark,
but I'm gonna bite.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.301
{\an8}You're a (bleep) clown.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.301
{\an8}You're a clown.

01:08.368 --> 01:10.370
{\an8}You're the whole
circus, bitch, and
I'm the ringleader.

01:10.437 --> 01:12.005
{\an8}Welcome to my show,
bitch.

01:12.071 --> 01:14.974
{\an8}I didn't mock her
(bleep)-ass mother!

01:15.041 --> 01:17.377
{\an8}Double our security
at the front entrance.

01:17.444 --> 01:18.711
{\an8}I'm walking out.

01:18.778 --> 01:23.483
{\an8}Our friend Safaree
has decided to join us.

01:23.550 --> 01:25.151
{\an8}(cheers and applause)

01:30.123 --> 01:35.462
(cheers and applause)

01:35.528 --> 01:36.796
{\an5}(Nina)
Safaree, welcome
to the stage.

01:36.863 --> 01:38.264
Thank you so much
for joining us.

01:38.331 --> 01:40.700
{\an5}Thank you for having me.

01:38.331 --> 01:40.700
Better late
than never.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.502
Can you tell me why
you're a little late?

01:42.569 --> 01:47.607
{\an8}I had a family emergency.

01:42.569 --> 01:47.607
{\an8}Okay, but people did say

01:47.674 --> 01:49.809
{\an5}that you went a little
silent, that nobody
could get ahold of you.

01:49.876 --> 01:52.378
You don't ever feel like
sometimes like, "Yo,

01:52.445 --> 01:54.747
{\an5}I don't feel like
talking to nobody today,
don't call my phone"?

01:54.814 --> 01:56.749
Yeah. I mean, unless
I have to be somewhere.

01:56.816 --> 02:00.086
{\an5}Yeah, but when you
got family (bleep)
to deal with and this,

02:00.153 --> 02:03.223
{\an5}it's like, family
over everything.

02:00.153 --> 02:03.223
Okay.

02:03.289 --> 02:06.292
{\an5}Safaree, I know you
kind of get in your
own shell at times

02:06.359 --> 02:08.761
{\an5}where you may not
talk to people or
share information,

02:08.828 --> 02:10.930
and certain people do feel
hurt by the fact that

02:10.997 --> 02:13.666
{\an5}they thought they
were friends with you
and didn't know anything.

02:13.733 --> 02:15.168
Nobody here is hurt.

02:15.235 --> 02:18.104
(audience murmurs)

02:18.171 --> 02:20.006
{\an5}You don't feel like you
have any friends on the
cast or you do?

02:20.073 --> 02:23.576
The word "friends"
is a deep word.

02:23.643 --> 02:25.478
So you weren't really
friends with Juju?

02:25.545 --> 02:27.146
Me and Juju was cool, yeah.

02:27.213 --> 02:29.582
We ain't close,
but I wish her the best.

02:29.649 --> 02:32.018
All right, I want to talk about
what happened in Costa Rica.

02:32.085 --> 02:35.288
Juju organized a beachside
gathering to help everyone

02:35.355 --> 02:37.724
let go of the issues that
were holding them back,

02:37.790 --> 02:41.728
{\an5}but then things took a turn
when it became time to air
some grievances.

02:41.794 --> 02:43.363
Let's take a look.

02:43.429 --> 02:47.300
{\an4}Safaree, you don't
feel like you owe me
and my lady an apology?

02:47.367 --> 02:49.702
{\an8}Nah, I'm lost.

02:47.367 --> 02:49.702
{\an8}So you don't remember

02:49.769 --> 02:51.838
{\an7}the phone call that you
and I had last week

02:51.905 --> 02:55.608
{\an7}about homegirl when I
asked you if you were
flying her out here

02:55.675 --> 03:01.748
{\an8}because that's my girl's
old work, so that was a man
call between you and I.

03:01.814 --> 03:03.182
{\an1}What we talking about,
though?

03:03.249 --> 03:06.185
Erica's here.

03:03.249 --> 03:06.185
{\an1}Oh!

03:06.252 --> 03:07.353
It's my business.
Ain't nobody seen her.

03:07.420 --> 03:09.022
Any of y'all seen her?

03:09.088 --> 03:11.624
{\an1}I'm not asking what the
(bleep) you think about it.

03:11.691 --> 03:13.459
{\an1}I don't give a (bleep)
about your views.

03:13.526 --> 03:16.329
{\an7}When you (bleep)
with my bitch old bitches,

03:16.396 --> 03:18.665
{\an7}you gonna respect
my (bleep) word, my (bleep).

03:18.731 --> 03:21.034
{\an7}The way you coming, clapping,
all that cursing (bleep),

03:21.100 --> 03:22.936
{\an8}my (bleep), I wouldn't
come at you like that.

03:23.002 --> 03:24.470
{\an8}You can still get
your (bleep) across...

03:24.537 --> 03:26.639
{\an7}You keep talking,
my (bleep), it's gonna
go a different way,

03:26.706 --> 03:28.675
{\an7}you hear me my (bleep)?
I'm not playing with you.

03:28.741 --> 03:32.812
{\an8}Baby, that's enough.

03:28.741 --> 03:32.812
{\an7}No, this (bleep)
held my kid!

03:32.879 --> 03:34.647
{\an7}I'll put this (bleep)
face in the sand.

03:34.714 --> 03:37.116
Don't play with me!

03:37.183 --> 03:38.952
(audience ohing)

03:39.018 --> 03:42.021
{\an5}Joe, what's the current
status of your relationship
with Safaree?

03:42.088 --> 03:46.492
{\an8}Let me be very clear. I have
no ill will toward Safaree.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.127
I wish Safaree the best.

03:48.194 --> 03:51.331
{\an1}That particular moment,
it was a learning experience.

03:51.397 --> 03:52.932
What was the
learning experience?

03:52.999 --> 03:54.634
{\an1}We're not what
we appear to be.

03:54.701 --> 03:56.336
You and Safaree?

03:54.701 --> 03:56.336
{\an1}Yeah.

03:56.402 --> 03:57.904
{\an5}Okay.

03:56.402 --> 03:57.904
And that's okay, too.

03:57.971 --> 04:00.340
{\an5}So Joe said
he learned something.

03:57.971 --> 04:00.340
{\an1}Yeah.

04:00.406 --> 04:01.841
{\an5}I learned something,
you know?

04:00.406 --> 04:01.841
{\an1}Okay.

04:01.908 --> 04:04.110
{\an1}Joe, he likes to...
he turned up for the camera

04:04.177 --> 04:07.347
because me and Joe was
together in the same bus,

04:07.413 --> 04:10.450
on the way to the bonfire,
he didn't say nothing,

04:10.516 --> 04:14.821
{\an5}but when it was time to
film, then it's, "I'll put
your face in the sand."

04:14.887 --> 04:17.390
Boom, boom, boom, and
all this other (bleep).

04:17.457 --> 04:18.891
That's turning up
for the camera,

04:18.958 --> 04:21.226
that's fake, that's
not real (bleep).

04:21.293 --> 04:22.662
{\an8}Safaree,
don't act smart now.

04:22.729 --> 04:24.564
{\an1}With all due respect,
this is between me and Joe.

04:24.631 --> 04:27.000
{\an1}Whatever's between you and Joe
is between me, you, and Joe.

04:27.066 --> 04:28.868
Whatever happens with
Joe got to do with me.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.169
{\an5}No, there's nothing
between us 'cause I don't
need to speak to you.

04:30.236 --> 04:31.337
I don't gotta speak
to you, either.

04:31.404 --> 04:32.839
I'm just correcting you,
that's all.

04:32.905 --> 04:34.173
Stop, or you gonna make me
(bleep) him up. Stop.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.408
All right.
I don't want you to

04:35.475 --> 04:36.643
(bleep) Safaree up,
so let's shut up.

04:36.709 --> 04:39.145
That's not gonna happen.
You a clown, (bleep).

04:39.212 --> 04:42.348
{\an5}Who is this?

04:39.212 --> 04:42.348
This is me, yeah.

04:42.415 --> 04:43.983
Ain't nothin' gonna
happen in here, so I'll

04:44.050 --> 04:45.752
pull up to your hotel after
and it can really go down.

04:45.818 --> 04:47.320
(audience ohing)

04:47.387 --> 04:49.122
Clown ass.
You a clown (bleep).

04:49.188 --> 04:50.823
You ain't putting
(bleep) in the sand.

04:50.890 --> 04:54.093
{\an5}There's no sand here.

04:50.890 --> 04:54.093
I know. You know what
I'm talking about,

04:54.160 --> 04:55.995
{\an5}and you still not funny.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.995
Safaree, wait a minute.

04:56.062 --> 04:59.899
{\an5}We see you on the show
but we're used to you
being jovial, being happy.

04:59.966 --> 05:02.235
This seems like
a total, different change.

05:02.301 --> 05:04.237
Because when I saw
that, it's like,

05:04.303 --> 05:06.339
they're in a moment.
I was ignoring them.

05:06.406 --> 05:07.940
{\an5}I low-key don't
even remember that
(bleep) happened,

05:08.007 --> 05:09.042
{\an5}and when I saw it,
it's like...

05:08.007 --> 05:09.042
You remember it happened.

05:09.108 --> 05:10.410
...that (bleep)
was mad extra.

05:10.476 --> 05:13.079
{\an1}You remembered it so much
that you waited for this day

05:13.146 --> 05:15.248
{\an1}to come here and feel
macho machismo about it.

05:15.314 --> 05:16.916
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?

05:16.983 --> 05:19.585
{\an5}So why you provoking?

05:16.983 --> 05:19.585
Shh-shh-shh.

05:19.652 --> 05:22.755
{\an5}Security. I lose too
much money (bleep)
him up right here.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.190
{\an5}It's not gonna happen.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.190
You ain't doing
none of that.

05:24.257 --> 05:26.559
{\an5}Can I say something?
No, listen, I'm not
here to fight.

05:26.626 --> 05:28.961
You're right. You don't
owe anything to anybody.

05:29.028 --> 05:30.730
We're not trying to be
in your business.

05:30.797 --> 05:33.800
{\an5}We just want to know
how to move so that
it can stay peaceful.

05:33.866 --> 05:35.268
We're going on
a trip to Costa Rica.

05:35.334 --> 05:37.403
Like, shawty and I
ain't end well.

05:37.470 --> 05:40.106
{\an5}This is more TV
(bleep) because...

05:37.470 --> 05:40.106
It's not TV (bleep).

05:40.173 --> 05:42.975
{\an5}...a month earlier, we
were all at Papoose...

05:40.173 --> 05:42.975
At Remy's baby shower?

05:43.042 --> 05:44.911
{\an5}At Remy's baby shower.

05:43.042 --> 05:44.911
Oh, great,
let's talk about it.

05:44.977 --> 05:48.414
{\an5}Hold on, hold on. Joe,
did you go up to Pap
and Remy and say,

05:48.481 --> 05:53.886
{\an5}"Yo, I need to know
what's up. Erica gonna
be there? Anybody who...?"

05:53.953 --> 05:56.355
{\an5}Y'all went, y'all saw
her there, and you
know what y'all did?

05:56.422 --> 05:59.225
{\an5}Y'all spoke.

05:56.422 --> 05:59.225
That's different.

05:59.292 --> 06:01.060
{\an4}It's the same thing.
What are you talking about?

05:59.292 --> 06:01.060
I don't have to be
cool with you to be...

06:01.127 --> 06:03.596
{\an5}I'm not your love.

06:01.127 --> 06:03.596
My love, listen to
what I'm saying to you.

06:03.663 --> 06:05.932
{\an4}Watch your (bleep) tone,
you bitch-ass (bleep),
you hear me?

06:05.998 --> 06:08.468
{\an5}That's the deep
voice... That's the
deep voice psychology.

06:08.534 --> 06:09.802
{\an1}As long as you hear me,
though.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.504
{\an5}Safaree...

06:09.869 --> 06:11.504
You a clown, (bleep).

06:11.571 --> 06:13.740
{\an5}A lot of emotions
here. We need to bring
it down a notch.

06:13.806 --> 06:15.408
Let's talk
on some real (bleep).

06:15.475 --> 06:18.411
{\an5}I'm not gonna go to
somebody's baby shower
who I respect,

06:18.478 --> 06:21.447
{\an1}who is my husband's coworker,
and start some (bleep).

06:21.514 --> 06:24.083
{\an5}I'm a (bleep) adult
and I'm cordial.

06:21.514 --> 06:24.083
{\an1}Y'all pick and choose,
period.

06:24.150 --> 06:26.352
{\an5}We don't pick and choose.

06:24.150 --> 06:26.352
You know why
he don't say nothing?

06:26.419 --> 06:28.721
{\an5}'Cause "Love &amp; Hip Hop"
cameras wasn't there.

06:26.419 --> 06:28.721
They was there.

06:28.788 --> 06:30.990
{\an5}Now there's cameras here.

06:28.788 --> 06:30.990
Okay, let's talk
about this,

06:31.057 --> 06:34.560
{\an5}because at the bonfire,
it seemed like it was
not just Joe and Cyn

06:34.627 --> 06:36.329
that were saying
they felt something.

06:36.395 --> 06:38.264
{\an5}It felt like everybody
felt that there was
like a secretive thing.

06:38.331 --> 06:45.004
{\an4}I think the issue is just
specific to Joe feeling like
based on that conversation,

06:45.071 --> 06:49.642
{\an4}you at least should
have told me.

06:45.071 --> 06:49.642
Why was it an issue that
Safaree brought Erica,

06:49.709 --> 06:51.911
even though nobody
never saw her?

06:51.978 --> 06:55.948
{\an4}I wanted to bring my woman,
so it wasn't even about
hiding from anybody here.

06:56.015 --> 06:58.484
That man is entitled to feel
like "I want to protect us."

06:58.551 --> 07:01.988
{\an8}You bring certain things
on TV and it gets blown
out of proportion,

07:02.054 --> 07:03.790
so at that moment,
he might have wanted

07:03.856 --> 07:06.592
to protect the sanctity
of their relationship.

07:06.659 --> 07:09.228
{\an8}Can I just say one thing?
If I know for a fact that
the person that I'm dating

07:09.295 --> 07:13.432
{\an8}has issues with Cyn,
has issues with Juju,
has issues with Rich,

07:13.499 --> 07:15.568
has issues with me,
which I didn't even know about,

07:15.635 --> 07:19.772
{\an5}heads up and say, "Listen,
I know you not rockin' with
this bitch, but she's coming."

07:19.839 --> 07:22.909
{\an4}Listen, man, I'm just
saying I'm not putting my
relationship on this (bleep)

07:22.975 --> 07:26.379
{\an5}for them to tear it down
and do the clownery that
they do to relationships.

07:26.445 --> 07:28.080
{\an5}(Nina)
I know you want to keep
your private life private,

07:28.147 --> 07:32.151
{\an5}but you are on a reality show
about your entire life...

07:28.147 --> 07:32.151
{\an3}Yes.

07:32.218 --> 07:35.822
{\an5}so sometimes it's confusing to
me when you sign up to show your
life and then you decide...

07:35.888 --> 07:37.156
{\an5}(Safaree)
So let me tell you
how I look at it.

07:37.223 --> 07:40.226
In real life,
I'm a happy-ass (bleep).

07:40.293 --> 07:44.130
{\an5}I laugh and play jokes.
I rub coconut on me
all day and do...

07:44.197 --> 07:46.232
That's what I'm used to seeing.
That's what I'm used to seeing.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.836
{\an5}So you know what?
This ain't me, and if
I came at you sideways,

07:49.902 --> 07:53.406
{\an5}whether you want to
accept it or not, Cyn,
I apologize. I'm sorry.

07:53.472 --> 07:57.276
{\an5}I don't have-- We don't
have an issue with you
or your fiancée.

07:57.343 --> 08:00.112
We just really loved you
and I'm getting emotional

08:00.179 --> 08:02.582
because I don't know
who this person is here,

08:02.648 --> 08:04.951
{\an5}but this is
not the person...

08:02.648 --> 08:04.951
I'm on defense.
That's why.

08:05.017 --> 08:06.319
'Cause I feel like
everyone's coming at me.

08:06.385 --> 08:09.188
This is not the person
that came into our home

08:09.255 --> 08:10.923
and held our child
many times.

08:10.990 --> 08:14.861
{\an5}We (bleep) with you,
so we at least wanted
that respect.

08:14.927 --> 08:18.564
{\an5}I don't have an issue
with you or with Erica,
and I'm a cordial bitch.

08:18.631 --> 08:21.234
{\an5}I may not (bleep) with
somebody, but that don't
mean I want to fight them.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.302
I can still have a
conversation with people.

08:23.369 --> 08:26.372
{\an5}I'm a grown-ass
mother(bleep) bitch,
and that's it.

08:26.439 --> 08:29.442
{\an5}Like, forget (bleep).
This (bleep) is not
that serious.

08:29.508 --> 08:31.010
{\an8}It isn't that serious,

08:31.077 --> 08:32.912
{\an8}and me being a private person,
I see what Safaree's doing.

08:32.979 --> 08:35.748
{\an5}He's protecting something
that he loves and he
doesn't want to mess up.

08:35.815 --> 08:39.719
{\an4}We wish you the best.
We really do wish you
the best.

08:35.815 --> 08:39.719
Likewise, likewise.

08:39.784 --> 08:42.855
And we're fine.
Everything's fine.

08:42.922 --> 08:45.925
So, Rich, let me go to you.
Why do you think Safaree

08:45.992 --> 08:49.595
{\an8}was kind of dodging the
conversation when you
decided to confront him?

08:49.662 --> 08:53.199
{\an8}Ask Safaree.

08:49.662 --> 08:53.199
{\an8}Okay. Safaree,

08:53.266 --> 08:57.803
It seemed like you just didn't
want to discuss Erica with Rich.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.172
{\an7}How many times I asked you
if you was (bleep) with Erica?

09:00.239 --> 09:02.108
{\an8}You never asked me that.

09:00.239 --> 09:02.108
{\an8}Yes, I did.

09:02.174 --> 09:06.445
{\an8}Yes, I did.

09:02.174 --> 09:06.445
{\an8}No, you didn't.

09:06.512 --> 09:08.514
{\an9}Like...

09:06.512 --> 09:08.514
{\an8}Safaree, come on, man.

09:08.581 --> 09:10.149
Like, come on, what
are you talking about?

09:10.216 --> 09:12.752
{\an1}All right.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.752
You know what?

09:15.588 --> 09:16.622
Yeah.

09:18.424 --> 09:20.626
I don't want to discuss
her with anybody.

09:20.693 --> 09:23.829
{\an5}I don't care who it is,
whether they know her
or don't know her.

09:23.896 --> 09:25.598
That boy in love.

09:25.665 --> 09:28.868
{\an5}Come on. She's
about to be my wife.
I gotta protect that.

09:28.935 --> 09:31.237
Did you feel that Rich was
out of line, coming to you

09:31.304 --> 09:33.606
and asking you
why you didn't tell him?

09:33.673 --> 09:36.776
{\an5}I don't got
no issue with Rich,
so I just didn't like

09:36.842 --> 09:39.245
{\an5}how it was like,
yo, why I keep on
being asked about her?

09:39.312 --> 09:42.515
{\an5}She's not even a cast
member. I'm now, like,
really kind of like Cyn.

09:42.581 --> 09:44.150
That's why I don't want to
keep on talking about her.

09:44.216 --> 09:46.752
{\an8}Now I'm like, where...?
Are y'all trying to

09:46.819 --> 09:50.056
{\an8}bring her back on the
show or what is happening?

09:50.122 --> 09:54.293
{\an5}Welcome to the stage...

09:50.122 --> 09:54.293
(laughter and cheering)

09:54.360 --> 09:56.762
All right, so, Rich, was it
something that bothered you

09:56.829 --> 10:00.566
{\an5}that you said you had asked
him a question and he just
didn't tell you the truth?

10:00.633 --> 10:05.071
{\an4}Absolutely, because me
and Safaree, although
we might not be friends,

10:05.137 --> 10:07.740
{\an1}I felt like we had enough
one-on-one moments.

10:07.807 --> 10:11.043
{\an1}Erica is however many
(bleep) removed from me.

10:11.110 --> 10:14.480
{\an5}I'm not the last person
she dated, so therefore,
it was not a big deal.

10:14.547 --> 10:16.449
Yo, your pants look way
too tight. I don't like

10:16.515 --> 10:18.217
seeing all them ankles
that I'm seeing.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.686
{\an5}We doing that?
We doing that?

10:18.284 --> 10:20.686
You-- just don't be
disrespectful.

10:20.753 --> 10:22.388
{\an5}Are we doing that?

10:20.753 --> 10:22.388
Don't be disrespectful.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.290
{\an5}Don't talk about
somebody like that.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.290
Are we doing that?

10:24.357 --> 10:25.358
She's not here.

10:24.357 --> 10:25.358
Mother(bleep)!

10:25.424 --> 10:27.126
Aah! Rich!

10:27.193 --> 10:30.262
{\an8}See, I'm the type of
bitch that I may bark,
but I'm gonna bite.

10:30.329 --> 10:33.165
{\an8}You're the biggest
train wreck I've ever
seen in my life.

10:33.232 --> 10:34.734
{\an8}You look
the other way, bitch.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.869
{\an8}You are messy.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.869
{\an8}...coming to her,

10:36.936 --> 10:38.804
{\an8}(bleep) up on all kinds
of (bleep) drugs.

10:38.871 --> 10:40.906
{\an8}Y'all need to stop barking up
the wrong mother(bleep) tree

10:40.973 --> 10:44.143
{\an8}and go with the Chihuahuas
and stop coming up to
mother(bleep) pit bulls.

10:49.915 --> 10:54.086
{\an1}Erica is however many
(bleep) removed from me.

10:54.153 --> 10:55.454
{\an8}Yo, your pants look way
too tight. I don't like

10:55.521 --> 10:57.323
{\an8}seeing all them ankles
that I'm seeing.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.925
{\an5}We doing that?
We doing that?

10:57.390 --> 10:59.925
Don't be disrespectful.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.360
{\an5}Don't talk about
somebody like that.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.360
Are we doing that?

11:01.427 --> 11:02.428
{\an5}Are we doing that?

11:01.427 --> 11:02.428
She's not here.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.263
{\an5}Mother(bleep)!

11:02.495 --> 11:04.263
Aah! Rich!

11:04.330 --> 11:05.998
(overlapping shouting)

11:06.065 --> 11:08.734
{\an5}That's good for TV!

11:06.065 --> 11:08.734
Rich, come on!

11:08.801 --> 11:10.269
Hey, yo, playboy!
(bleep)!

11:10.336 --> 11:12.438
{\an4}This... Okay,
let's play that game.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.438
Shut your stupid ass up!

11:12.505 --> 11:13.572
{\an5}Calm down.

11:12.505 --> 11:13.572
{\an5}Let play a game.

11:12.505 --> 11:13.572
(bleep) table.

11:13.639 --> 11:14.940
Play that game, (bleep).

11:15.007 --> 11:17.676
{\an1}That was in (bleep) slow-mo.
Look at me run in slow-mo.

11:17.743 --> 11:23.249
{\an5}Slow-motion.

11:17.743 --> 11:23.249
All right, we just gotta
get everybody to sit down.

11:23.315 --> 11:26.285
Yo, you okay?
I saw your ankle twist.

11:26.352 --> 11:29.121
You okay Rich?
Make sure he's okay.

11:29.188 --> 11:31.824
{\an5}I'ma see him.
I'ma see him.

11:29.188 --> 11:31.824
{\an3}Calm down.

11:31.891 --> 11:34.326
{\an1}I'll make it uncomfortable
for all you (bleep).

11:34.393 --> 11:36.562
{\an1}You (bleep) want to play?
Let's play (bleep).

11:36.629 --> 11:37.897
{\an1}I'm from the eastside.
Let's play.

11:40.266 --> 11:44.103
{\an6}Hey!

11:40.266 --> 11:44.103
Joe, you got
the other way in?

11:44.170 --> 11:46.906
{\an5}All right, clearly
that was crazy,
a little unexpected.

11:46.972 --> 11:48.941
{\an8}I don't understand
why you think he
has to tell you

11:49.008 --> 11:52.111
{\an8}anything about his
relationship, and I
love Rich to death.

11:52.178 --> 11:54.513
Stop acting like you care.
Don't try to embarrass him.

11:54.580 --> 11:56.115
What he said was
very disrespectful.

11:56.182 --> 11:59.018
{\an5}I would never sit
here and speak about
another man's woman,

11:59.085 --> 12:00.386
especially when
they're not here.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.254
(applause)

12:02.321 --> 12:04.824
Let's end this on a fun note.
Can we get a "straight"?

12:04.890 --> 12:08.160
{\an5}Straight, all right!

12:04.890 --> 12:08.160
There we go.

12:08.227 --> 12:13.232
{\an5}All right, let's move on.
Hurricane Jonathan has often
been the eye of the storm

12:13.299 --> 12:16.902
when it comes to the ladies'
drama on "Love &amp; Hip Hop,"

12:16.969 --> 12:21.207
{\an5}but after becoming aware that
other factors may have been
clouding his judgement,

12:21.273 --> 12:23.843
he committed to moving
on a different path.

12:23.909 --> 12:27.079
Let's check out what led
to his climate change.

12:27.146 --> 12:30.683
{\an1}I came to celebrate you,
it's your birthday, but...

12:30.749 --> 12:33.552
{\an4}although I had to hear it
from somebody else that you
have a problem with me.

12:33.619 --> 12:36.188
{\an4}I sat and had a
conversation with you...

12:33.619 --> 12:36.188
Yes, you did, and...

12:36.255 --> 12:38.624
{\an7}about how I felt about her
and you shared things with me

12:38.691 --> 12:41.660
{\an7}how you felt about her
so why would you bring
her to my birthday?

12:41.727 --> 12:44.463
{\an7}Wait.

12:41.727 --> 12:44.463
{\an8}We got class here.

12:44.530 --> 12:46.699
{\an5}I know you doubt
that (bleep).

12:44.530 --> 12:46.699
{\an1}What are you
talking about now?

12:46.765 --> 12:49.802
{\an5}You doubted
that I have class.

12:46.765 --> 12:49.802
Yo, this bitch better
shut the (bleep) up.

12:49.869 --> 12:51.570
Hold on!
Come on!

12:51.637 --> 12:53.639
{\an8}The minute Juju walked
through the (bleep) door,

12:53.706 --> 12:55.407
{\an8}if you had an issue with her,
you should have did

12:55.474 --> 12:57.576
{\an8}what you ended up doing,
which was leaving.

12:57.643 --> 12:59.578
{\an8}It was not only Anais'
(bleep) fault

12:59.645 --> 13:01.647
{\an8}why your (bleep) funeral
didn't happen, bitch!

13:01.714 --> 13:03.415
{\an8}(overlapping shouting)

13:03.482 --> 13:06.852
Have a good time with your
dusty-ass wig. Bye, bitch!

13:06.919 --> 13:10.456
{\an4}I know that there's
issues amongst the
group and everything,

13:10.523 --> 13:12.224
{\an1}but I have to
tell you guys this.

13:12.291 --> 13:15.694
{\an8}For maybe eight years now,

13:15.761 --> 13:18.731
{\an7}I've been taking
anxiety medication.

13:15.761 --> 13:18.731
{\an9}Wow.

13:18.797 --> 13:20.666
{\an7}I'm not supposed to be
mixing them with alcohol.

13:22.134 --> 13:23.936
(applause)

13:24.003 --> 13:25.871
{\an1}Jeesh!

13:25.938 --> 13:27.940
{\an5}(Nina)
Rich, thank you
for coming back.

13:28.007 --> 13:30.342
Okay. So, Jonathan, let's talk
about the birthday party first

13:30.409 --> 13:32.444
because it definitely got
off to a very sexy start.

13:32.511 --> 13:35.514
{\an5}Anais was singing
"Happy Birthday" to you.

13:32.511 --> 13:35.514
Was she ever!

13:35.581 --> 13:37.750
She is not here tonight.
Can you tell us how she's doing?

13:37.816 --> 13:40.986
{\an8}Anais is doing better.

13:41.053 --> 13:44.323
I have my personal opinions
of what I think happened to her.

13:44.390 --> 13:47.293
{\an5}I think Anais was drugged.

13:44.390 --> 13:47.293
Really?

13:47.359 --> 13:49.161
I think Anais
is completely lucid.

13:49.228 --> 13:50.763
I don't think Anais
is insane.

13:50.829 --> 13:52.631
She's actually better
than she used to be,

13:52.698 --> 13:55.834
{\an1}because I think now she's
aware of what her mind can do.

13:55.901 --> 13:58.070
Rich, have you been able
to speak with Anais?

13:58.137 --> 14:01.840
{\an5}We speak often,
actually. She had a
moment and she's back.

14:01.907 --> 14:04.443
{\an4}Okay.

14:01.907 --> 14:04.443
And she's moving forward.

14:04.510 --> 14:07.980
{\an4}She is an amazing
woman. She is the most
talented musician

14:08.047 --> 14:09.949
that I have
personally ever heard

14:10.015 --> 14:14.920
{\an5}and she will continue
to fight for her music and
her kids and her marriage.

14:14.987 --> 14:19.091
{\an5}(Nina)
Thank you so much for the
update, 'cause I know a lot of
people were worried about her.

14:19.158 --> 14:21.060
{\an5}Let's talk about the
party, because, Juju,
you weren't invited.

14:21.126 --> 14:22.628
Why did you decide to go?

14:22.695 --> 14:25.297
{\an7}Because I know
how big Jonathan's
birthdays are for him

14:25.364 --> 14:30.803
{\an4}And Jonathan and Yandy flew
to Miami for my graduation and
it was a special moment for me,

14:30.869 --> 14:34.106
{\an5}so I wanted to be there
for him. I didn't think
it was, like, a big deal.

14:34.173 --> 14:36.976
Jonathan, how did you feel
about Juju coming to the party?

14:37.042 --> 14:40.679
{\an4}All right,
so here's the dilly.
I didn't admit it before.

14:40.746 --> 14:43.115
{\an4}I'm admitting it now because
I'm clean of everything.

14:40.746 --> 14:43.115
Okay.

14:43.182 --> 14:46.051
{\an1}I was down with a whole bunch of
other (bleep) than just pills.

14:46.118 --> 14:48.487
People speculated it.
I think some cast members

14:48.554 --> 14:50.222
asked me before,
"What are you on?"

14:50.289 --> 14:51.957
People felt
that you were off.

14:52.024 --> 14:53.826
{\an4}I'm always on 10.
Don't get that twisted.

14:52.024 --> 14:53.826
Right.

14:53.892 --> 14:56.562
{\an5}(laughter)

14:53.892 --> 14:56.562
But, bitch, I was on 100,

14:56.629 --> 14:59.398
{\an4}'cause I was coming to her,
(bleep) up on all kinds
of (bleep) drugs,

14:59.465 --> 15:06.105
{\an5}so when I was outside
of Macy's, was I pissed
at Juju? I was, 100%.

15:06.171 --> 15:08.440
{\an5}Is she fake and phony?
Hell no.

15:06.171 --> 15:08.440
{\an1}Okay.

15:08.507 --> 15:10.142
I should have never used
those words for her.

15:10.209 --> 15:13.145
What she has shown me
is class and elegance

15:13.212 --> 15:16.215
and compassion and caring
and no judgement.

15:16.282 --> 15:18.651
{\an5}(Nina)
I love that. I love it.

15:16.282 --> 15:18.651
It's the truth.

15:18.717 --> 15:20.919
Rich, I know that sometimes you
look at things with a keen eye.

15:20.986 --> 15:23.956
{\an5}Why do you think that
Jonathan is always close
to some of the drama?

15:24.023 --> 15:26.959
{\an4}Oh, you can be
honest now.

15:24.023 --> 15:26.959
{\an3}I am.

15:27.026 --> 15:28.727
Or you can plead
the Fifth.

15:28.794 --> 15:32.831
Jonathan,
as self-admitted,

15:32.898 --> 15:35.100
{\an5}if he was in sober
mind and sober body,
which he is now,

15:35.167 --> 15:38.137
{\an5}he probably would be like,
let me de-escalate this...

15:35.167 --> 15:38.137
Right.

15:38.203 --> 15:40.773
{\an5}Right.

15:38.203 --> 15:40.773
"Yo, girls, stop. This
is not what we doing,"

15:40.839 --> 15:42.608
as opposed
to the hyperbole.

15:42.675 --> 15:45.544
{\an4}Well, no, I don't hype
them up. I do try to
stop the situations.

15:45.611 --> 15:48.213
{\an8}Let's be honest,
you are messy.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.415
{\an1}And what the (bleep)
are you?

15:49.481 --> 15:50.949
What the (bleep)?

15:51.016 --> 15:53.752
{\an1}You're the biggest train wreck
I've ever seen in my life.

15:53.819 --> 15:55.287
{\an5}No. I'll just
being honest.

15:53.819 --> 15:55.287
{\an3}Honey...

15:55.354 --> 15:56.455
{\an1}I wasn't trying to, like,
start nothing with you.

15:56.522 --> 15:58.490
Miss Thing,
you keep talking,

15:58.557 --> 16:00.426
{\an4}(imitates mockingly)
"'Cause I was an
internet celebrity."

16:00.492 --> 16:03.395
{\an5}Internet celebrity for what?
You were gooping men.

16:00.492 --> 16:03.395
{\an1}Never.

16:03.462 --> 16:06.432
{\an5}Honey, you were
lying to them.

16:03.462 --> 16:06.432
Jonathan, stop.

16:06.498 --> 16:08.334
{\an5}Why you don't tell
her to stop, Rich?
That's not fair!

16:08.400 --> 16:10.502
{\an5}Because I want to
tell her to stop too.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.502
So tell her first.

16:10.569 --> 16:11.770
{\an5}Tell her first.

16:10.569 --> 16:11.770
All right, stop it.

16:11.837 --> 16:13.739
{\an5}You stop it
and you stop it.

16:11.837 --> 16:13.739
Tell her first.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.074
Let's get back
to the vineyard because...

16:15.140 --> 16:16.475
{\an1}Don't look me up
and down, Sidney Starr.

16:16.542 --> 16:18.777
{\an5}(Nina)
Okay, you guys,
let's move on.

16:18.844 --> 16:20.045
We're talking about
something else right now.

16:20.112 --> 16:23.015
{\an1}You... You look
the other way, bitch.

16:23.082 --> 16:25.818
{\an5}(Nina)
We are going to move on, guys.
Thank you so much.

16:25.884 --> 16:29.722
{\an5}A peaceful setting was
disrupted when Mariahlynn
took offense to a "Whoo, child"

16:29.788 --> 16:33.392
{\an5}and things went from zero
to alt Nya in the blink
of an eye.

16:33.459 --> 16:36.295
Let's see how the Moscato
melee nearly popped off.

16:36.362 --> 16:39.498
{\an8}And if I had to pick
a side, and I will say
this to her if I need to,

16:39.565 --> 16:43.235
{\an8}I'm always gonna pick
Yandy's side. No, I'm
not picking between you.

16:43.302 --> 16:46.839
{\an7}I'm excusing myself
from this situation.
I'll walk away.

16:46.905 --> 16:48.540
{\an7}I don't need friends
at the end of the day.

16:48.607 --> 16:50.242
Whoo, child.
Your friends are weird.

16:50.309 --> 16:52.745
{\an4}"Whoo, child." Poop,
be gone. Nobody was
coming for you.

16:52.811 --> 16:54.646
Not with me, boo-boo.
Not with me.

16:54.713 --> 16:57.683
{\an8}You said, "Whoo, child."

16:54.713 --> 16:57.683
{\an8}Yeah, and I wasn't
talking to you.

16:57.750 --> 17:00.185
{\an7}Okay, and I've never
had a problem with you,

17:00.252 --> 17:02.488
{\an7}so I don't even know why
you coming at me like
this right now.

17:02.554 --> 17:05.758
{\an8}Bitch!

17:02.554 --> 17:05.758
{\an8}Nya, don't do it!

17:05.824 --> 17:11.563
{\an7}Nya, do not do it!
Nya, please, don't do it!
Nya, please, no! Nya!

17:11.630 --> 17:13.499
{\an5}Nya Lee!

17:11.630 --> 17:13.499
(glass shatters)

17:13.565 --> 17:17.169
{\an5}You gotta be (bleep) up
if you think I'm one of
these duck-ass bitches!

17:19.037 --> 17:22.107
{\an5}(Nina)
Mariah, things went from zero
to 100 with the conversation.

17:22.174 --> 17:23.742
It felt like you kind of
took something personal.

17:23.809 --> 17:28.213
{\an7}I tried to remove myself
from the situation,
and as I walked away,

17:28.280 --> 17:31.383
{\an4}she said the "Whoo, child,"
and I turned around
and on the walk back,

17:31.450 --> 17:34.486
{\an5}yes, I dropped my bag
'cause I wasn't gonna
swing my bag or hit her.

17:34.553 --> 17:36.588
I didn't have
no intentions on fighting.

17:36.655 --> 17:40.526
{\an5}When I sat down, she said,
"Oh, you making it about you,
you making it about you."

17:40.592 --> 17:43.395
{\an5}How was I making it about me?

17:40.592 --> 17:43.395
So, Nya, when you
made the comment,

17:43.462 --> 17:44.997
it seemed like you guys
were joking.

17:45.063 --> 17:47.800
{\an8}Thank you, I was trying to make
light of the situation

17:47.866 --> 17:49.635
{\an8}because it was getting serious.

17:49.701 --> 17:54.440
{\an5}If I have a problem
or if I want to come
at you, I come like this.

17:54.506 --> 17:56.809
If I'm playing,
I'm talking like that.

17:56.875 --> 17:58.710
That's the problem with
little bitches like you.

17:58.777 --> 18:01.113
Y'all poke, y'all poke,
y'all poke.

18:01.180 --> 18:03.148
A bitch jump on that ass,
then they a bully.

18:03.215 --> 18:05.684
Y'all need to stop barking up
the wrong mother(bleep) tree

18:05.751 --> 18:08.320
{\an5}and go with the Chihuahuas
and stop coming up to
mother(bleep) pit bulls.

18:08.387 --> 18:09.988
{\an4}(bleep)!

18:08.387 --> 18:09.988
The thing is, baby...

18:10.055 --> 18:12.191
{\an5}But the thing is, baby...

18:10.055 --> 18:12.191
Number two, number two...

18:12.257 --> 18:14.526
{\an5}I let you speak.
'Cause I let you speak...
I shut the (bleep) up

18:14.593 --> 18:15.994
{\an5}and let you speak, so you
gonna shut up and listen.

18:14.593 --> 18:15.994
I don't give a (bleep).

18:16.061 --> 18:17.763
{\an5}You are gonna listen.

18:16.061 --> 18:17.763
No, I'm not.

18:17.830 --> 18:21.233
{\an5}She said if someone
stands up, that means
they want to fight,

18:21.300 --> 18:24.570
{\an5}and where I'm from,
if you drop your purse
two tables down

18:24.636 --> 18:27.506
{\an5}and walk up on
a bitch who got cut,
you wanna fight.

18:27.573 --> 18:29.541
{\an5}I don't give
a (bleep) if you was
an infant (bleep),

18:29.608 --> 18:30.976
I'll knock you
the (bleep) down.

18:31.043 --> 18:32.244
(laughter and applause)

18:32.311 --> 18:34.379
You never gonna get
one up on me, bitch.

18:34.446 --> 18:37.749
{\an5}See, I'm the type of
bitch that I may bark,
but I'm gonna bite.

18:37.816 --> 18:39.418
(overlapping shouting)

18:39.485 --> 18:42.387
What you want to do?
What does that mean?

18:42.454 --> 18:45.123
Bitch, you press like
an iron for little old me!

18:45.190 --> 18:48.193
A little bitch like me
got you super pissed!

18:48.260 --> 18:50.329
{\an5}You talk to me about
my (bleep) scar?

18:48.260 --> 18:50.329
Yeah, bitch!

18:50.395 --> 18:54.433
{\an4}'Cause you said, "I got
100 bitches for you!
Self can't save you!"

18:54.500 --> 19:00.038
{\an4}I'm 5'1". Look, 5'1".
This bitch is 10 feet tall
like a Jolly Green Giant!

19:00.105 --> 19:02.241
{\an5}And I will beat your ass
down to 2 feet!

19:00.105 --> 19:02.241
No, hold on!

19:02.307 --> 19:05.277
{\an1}This bitch said she got
100 bitches for little old me!

19:05.344 --> 19:07.246
You know what?
You right, bitch!

19:07.312 --> 19:09.882
{\an4}You gonna need 100 bitches
for me 'cause I'm gonna run
you over with a vehicle, bitch!

19:09.948 --> 19:12.184
Bitch, you gonna get
your ass beat every time!

19:12.251 --> 19:13.452
I'll beat that bitch
with a bat!

19:13.519 --> 19:15.420
(Nina)
This seems really escalated

19:15.487 --> 19:18.357
over a picnic conversation.
This is crazy.

19:18.423 --> 19:21.693
{\an5}I didn't mock her
crazy (bleep) mother,
her (bleep) mama!

19:21.760 --> 19:24.463
(audience ohing)

19:24.530 --> 19:27.833
{\an7}Do you know the potential max
time that she's facing?

19:24.530 --> 19:27.833
{\an9}20.

19:27.900 --> 19:28.934
{\an8}You think she should
take the plea?

19:29.001 --> 19:31.270
{\an8}In all honesty...

19:31.336 --> 19:34.439
{\an8}Someone that's in the
industry telling me this is
not somewhere I want to be,

19:34.506 --> 19:36.241
{\an8}it kind of... he just
pushed me away a little bit.

19:36.308 --> 19:38.477
{\an7}I'm not gonna sit here
and do that. Like...

19:45.584 --> 19:47.753
{\an1}I ain't (bleep) with no bitch
that gonna mock my scar!

19:47.819 --> 19:51.256
{\an8}I didn't mock her
crazy (bleep) mother,
her (bleep) mama!

19:51.323 --> 19:53.625
(audience ohing)

19:53.692 --> 19:55.794
{\an1}I don't talk about
your family!

19:55.861 --> 19:57.596
{\an8}You are a (bleep)!

19:57.663 --> 19:59.498
{\an8}Don't talk about
my mother, bitch!

19:59.565 --> 20:02.000
{\an1}Get the (bleep) out of here!
I take care of my sister,

20:02.067 --> 20:05.637
{\an4}and if anything, bitch,
I'm more of a mother than
you could ever be, bitch!

20:05.704 --> 20:07.272
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

20:07.339 --> 20:09.408
{\an1}I'm more of a mother
than you could ever be!

20:09.474 --> 20:11.877
You a bully, bitch!
You tried to bully Sidney!

20:11.944 --> 20:14.346
{\an4}I am, I am, 'cause when
y'all (bleep) with me,
the bully shows up.

20:14.413 --> 20:16.715
{\an4}But you can't bully me,
bitch!

20:14.413 --> 20:16.715
Suck my (bleep).

20:16.782 --> 20:18.050
You ugly, you ugly.

20:18.116 --> 20:20.319
{\an7}Yo, yo, yo. We not fighting.
That's it. Let's chill.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.387
{\an8}Nya, don't you think
that was a low blow

20:22.454 --> 20:24.122
{\an8}to talk about her mother?

20:24.189 --> 20:27.926
{\an5}It was a low blow
to talk about my scar!

20:24.189 --> 20:27.926
Sidney, stay out of it!

20:27.993 --> 20:30.262
You guys, we gonna move on.
Let's just finish it.

20:30.329 --> 20:32.497
{\an5}You're a clown, bitch!

20:30.329 --> 20:32.497
You're a (bleep) clown!

20:32.564 --> 20:33.932
{\an5}You're a clown.
You're the whole
circus, bitch,

20:33.999 --> 20:36.768
and I'm the ringleader.
Welcome to my show, bitch.

20:36.835 --> 20:38.670
{\an5}(Nina)
All right, we've got to
settle down a little.

20:38.737 --> 20:40.706
{\an5}Maggie wasn't feeling
the support from Maino
when it came to her music

20:40.772 --> 20:44.009
and when she found out he was
putting Alexis on the track,

20:44.076 --> 20:47.479
{\an5}Maino's chick went from
being "badder than yours"
to "madder than yours."

20:47.546 --> 20:49.815
Let's see how it went down.

20:49.881 --> 20:53.785
{\an8}(Maino)
We went in the green room
and the shooting started.

20:53.852 --> 20:56.989
{\an8}My girlfriend Maggie was hit.
She was shot in her leg and, um,

20:57.055 --> 21:00.292
{\an8}she definitely has physical
and emotional scars from
the incident.

21:00.359 --> 21:05.230
{\an8}Maybe hopes of more
help getting over
this PTSD thing,

21:05.297 --> 21:09.668
{\an8}I was thinking about
possibly, you know,
doing music again.

21:09.735 --> 21:11.970
{\an5}You have to be serious
about it if you're saying
that you want to do it.

21:12.037 --> 21:14.206
{\an5}So you don't believe
in me enough to put
me on a song?

21:14.272 --> 21:17.676
{\an5}What song you
talking about?

21:14.272 --> 21:17.676
The "Badder
Than Yours" song.

21:17.743 --> 21:20.579
{\an8}I'm actually about to get
in the studio with Maino.

21:20.646 --> 21:23.649
{\an8}He was talking about
some song. The song
is called "Badder"

21:23.715 --> 21:25.717
{\an8}or "My Girl's Badder,"
something like that.

21:25.784 --> 21:30.255
{\an8}I asked you to
get on this one.

21:25.784 --> 21:30.255
{\an7}Pssh!

21:31.957 --> 21:35.127
{\an8}I've never heard you
take music serious.

21:35.193 --> 21:36.795
{\an7}I didn't stop you
from doing it.

21:36.862 --> 21:39.331
{\an7}If you want...
If you...

21:36.862 --> 21:39.331
{\an8}But you're not
helping me either.

21:39.398 --> 21:41.366
{\an8}And when I find a team
that's gonna help me,

21:41.433 --> 21:43.535
I want you to have
that same energy

21:43.602 --> 21:45.437
because I can do
whatever I want to do.

21:45.504 --> 21:47.439
(applause)

21:47.506 --> 21:48.974
Maggie, I want to
talk to you a little bit.

21:49.041 --> 21:52.077
How has Maino been there for
you during your healing process,

21:52.144 --> 21:54.613
both mentally and physically,
after being shot?

21:54.680 --> 21:57.282
{\an1}He was there a lot,
um, physically for me.

21:57.349 --> 21:59.951
{\an1}We had to do things together.
He had to be there.

22:00.018 --> 22:07.059
{\an4}Mentally, he's a little
rough when it comes to
emotional things.

22:00.018 --> 22:07.059
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

22:07.125 --> 22:11.430
{\an8}I look at things
from a perspective of,
it could be worse.

22:11.496 --> 22:13.598
You gonna be able to live
your life the right way.

22:13.665 --> 22:18.637
{\an5}So many people don't recover
from that, so I always look
at things on a brighter side,

22:18.704 --> 22:22.641
{\an4}so it comes across
as me not caring as much
sometimes, but it's just me

22:22.708 --> 22:26.344
{\an5}trying to push you to be
the best you that you
could be, that's all.

22:26.411 --> 22:31.216
{\an5}So, Maggie, let's talk a
little bit about being pushed
into this hip-hop career.

22:31.283 --> 22:34.052
How has your music helped you
cope with your PTSD?

22:34.119 --> 22:40.125
{\an4}It hasn't. Um, I haven't
done as much music since
I've been shot,

22:40.192 --> 22:43.662
{\an4}dealing with someone
that's in the industry
and a professional rapper

22:43.729 --> 22:45.630
telling me this is not
somewhere I want to be,

22:45.697 --> 22:47.632
so it did tear me
from music a bit.

22:47.699 --> 22:50.402
Now it's like, I went
to school for dancing.

22:50.469 --> 22:52.270
{\an1}I can't dance anymore.
I can't run.

22:52.337 --> 22:54.973
{\an1}If I make a hit today or
tomorrow, am I gonna be able

22:55.040 --> 22:58.977
{\an1}to go get on that stage or do
that dance and give my all?

22:59.044 --> 23:01.680
{\an4}So it kind of, you know,
just pushed me away
a little bit.

23:01.747 --> 23:06.551
{\an4}Well, in the music industry,
Maino, do you feel like she
has potential to make it?

23:06.618 --> 23:09.588
Of course. I didn't tell
her not to do music.

23:09.654 --> 23:14.359
{\an5}All I did was say, look,
there's a lane somewhere
else that we could tackle,

23:14.426 --> 23:18.263
{\an5}so if you invest some
time in that, then you'll
have a full foundation.

23:18.330 --> 23:22.000
{\an5}She's a business owner,
Hair Like Maggie,
has her own store,

23:22.067 --> 23:26.304
{\an5}so I felt like that
foundation was a great
foundation to start from.

23:26.371 --> 23:29.274
So when you had the song,
"My Bitch Is Badder Than Yours,"

23:29.341 --> 23:31.510
and you asked Alexis
to be on it...

23:31.576 --> 23:33.278
{\an1}Well, I didn't
necessarily ask her.

23:33.345 --> 23:35.514
{\an8}He didn't ask me,
so I'm gonna correct that.

23:35.580 --> 23:38.617
{\an4}I was looking for a
new team to work with.

23:35.580 --> 23:38.617
Okay.

23:38.683 --> 23:41.186
Maino said, like, "I think
this song would fit you."

23:41.253 --> 23:42.754
He didn't say, "Oh, can
you get on this song?"

23:42.821 --> 23:44.156
Okay.

23:42.821 --> 23:44.156
Right.

23:44.222 --> 23:45.657
So I'm not gonna sit
here and do all that

23:45.724 --> 23:47.225
{\an1}'cause at the end of
the day, I'd (bleep) Maggie

23:47.292 --> 23:49.494
{\an5}and I know they're
together and I'm not
with that messy (bleep).

23:49.561 --> 23:50.562
(Maino)
That's right.

23:50.629 --> 23:51.797
(cheers and applause)

23:51.863 --> 23:53.265
{\an1}I know Maggie to be
a singer,

23:53.331 --> 23:55.534
{\an1}so one day,
I'm playing that song

23:55.600 --> 23:57.569
{\an1}and she say, "Oh,
I'm jumping on that."

23:57.636 --> 24:01.039
{\an5}Now, in my mind, I'm
thinking, she's joking,
she's not serious.

24:01.106 --> 24:03.375
{\an1}Since then,
she's surprised me.

24:03.441 --> 24:06.344
Whatever doubt that I had in
my mind about her abilities,

24:06.411 --> 24:07.445
I had to question
my own self.

24:07.512 --> 24:08.613
Listen, we gotta prove

24:08.680 --> 24:09.881
something to each
other every day.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.750
{\an5}That's just life.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.750
So, Maggie,

24:11.817 --> 24:13.485
{\an5}would you consider
yourself a rapper
or is it a hybrid?

24:13.552 --> 24:16.988
{\an4}No, I'm still not
a rapper. I still
consider myself a singer,

24:17.055 --> 24:18.456
{\an1}but I'ma do
what I want to do.

24:18.523 --> 24:21.526
{\an4}If I want to go play
the violin tomorrow,
I'ma go do it.

24:21.593 --> 24:23.094
And I love
you guys' relationship.

24:23.161 --> 24:25.330
Is something you might want
to do is get married one day?

24:25.397 --> 24:28.099
{\an4}I always thought that,
you know, I was gonna
be married by 30,

24:28.166 --> 24:33.104
{\an4}have a baby, and I was
a planner, but since
I've got with him,

24:33.171 --> 24:35.841
I've learned to just
let things play out.

24:35.907 --> 24:38.877
{\an1}It's nothing more I would want
than to have his last name,

24:38.944 --> 24:43.181
{\an4}but, um, other than that,
I think life is great.
We're not in a rush.

24:38.944 --> 24:43.181
Okay.

24:43.248 --> 24:44.583
I like that.
Maino, do you agree?

24:44.649 --> 24:47.452
Listen, things...
things will happen...

24:47.519 --> 24:49.654
{\an5}...when it's right.

24:47.519 --> 24:49.654
There's no sense in rushing.

24:49.721 --> 24:51.256
We living a married life
anyway.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.458
{\an8}Listen, for him to be
settled down with Maggie

24:53.525 --> 24:55.594
{\an8}the way he is
and the way I see him...

24:53.525 --> 24:55.594
{\an5}For real, for real.

24:55.660 --> 24:56.828
{\an5}...you got that.

24:55.660 --> 24:56.828
{\an3}Got that.

24:56.895 --> 24:59.898
{\an5}You heard? You got that.

24:56.895 --> 24:59.898
She got that.

24:59.965 --> 25:02.868
{\an5}I can't wait to see you grow
and maybe here some new
music as well,

25:02.934 --> 25:05.303
so I'm definitely rooting
for the both of you, all right?

25:05.370 --> 25:08.940
Now, let's move on. Rich's life
was rocked when he got the news

25:09.007 --> 25:11.343
that his daughter's mother
was facing jail time,

25:11.409 --> 25:15.013
{\an5}and as things unfolded
and her situation appeared
more and more bleak,

25:15.080 --> 25:16.815
he realized that
his family would need

25:16.882 --> 25:19.284
a miracle of their own.
Let's take a look.

25:19.351 --> 25:22.220
{\an1}There is a possibility
that I will do jail time.

25:22.287 --> 25:26.725
{\an8}You were in your own little
moment and this just happened
and I don't blame you for that.

25:26.791 --> 25:28.727
{\an8}Whatever happens,
I'm gonna be here for you.

25:28.793 --> 25:32.597
{\an8}This is gonna be (bleep)
up for everybody for
a little while, right?

25:32.664 --> 25:35.200
She does have to go away.
Like, with the siblings,

25:35.267 --> 25:36.935
{\an7}like, we need to know what's
gonna happen with them.

25:37.002 --> 25:39.771
{\an8}I don't want to have to
end up quitting college
because...

25:39.838 --> 25:42.607
{\an7}No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.
We're not doing that.

25:42.674 --> 25:44.542
{\an8}Where we at with Ashley?

25:44.609 --> 25:46.244
{\an7}<i>Ashley...</i>
<i>(laughs)</i>

25:46.311 --> 25:48.947
{\an8}Why? What happened?

25:46.311 --> 25:48.947
{\an7}<i>She tells me,</i>
<i>"I'm gonna leave soon."</i>

25:49.014 --> 25:50.248
{\an8}When did this
conversation happen?

25:50.315 --> 25:52.150
{\an8}I just (bleep) spoke
to her and she told me

25:52.217 --> 25:55.487
{\an8}she was trying to go back
to school before the 13th!

25:55.553 --> 25:57.923
{\an7}I couldn't even go to class.
I couldn't even focus.

25:57.989 --> 26:02.494
{\an7}Like, I couldn't listen,
I couldn't turn in assignments.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.629
{\an8}Why wouldn't you call me?

26:02.560 --> 26:04.629
{\an8}Like, there's just
so much going on.

26:04.696 --> 26:05.864
{\an8}Everything, like,
I don't have to...

26:05.931 --> 26:07.632
{\an8}I don't want to
put that on you.

26:07.699 --> 26:09.234
{\an7}I want to make y'all happy
and I want to

26:09.301 --> 26:10.869
{\an1}do everything
to make y'all happy,

26:10.936 --> 26:14.306
{\an1}but I can't do that
if I'm not happy myself.

26:16.041 --> 26:18.009
(Nina)
That was tough to watch, Rich.

26:18.076 --> 26:19.644
{\an5}We know how much you love
your daughter.

26:18.076 --> 26:19.644
{\an3}Indeed.

26:19.711 --> 26:21.179
What's going on
with Miracle's case?

26:21.246 --> 26:22.814
Like, what's
the status with that?

26:22.881 --> 26:26.117
{\an7}So Miracle goes to trial
on April 19th, so right now,

26:26.184 --> 26:29.154
{\an5}we're basically going
over strategies and
things of that nature.

26:29.220 --> 26:32.190
{\an4}Do you know the potential max
time that she's facing?

26:29.220 --> 26:32.190
{\an3}20.

26:32.257 --> 26:35.427
{\an5}Ooh! How is Ashley doing?
We saw that she was
struggling with school.

26:35.493 --> 26:38.763
See, the problem is,
they're in Memphis,

26:38.830 --> 26:40.966
{\an5}and I'm between
Atlanta and New York.

26:38.830 --> 26:40.966
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

26:41.032 --> 26:42.801
So those face-to-face
conversations

26:42.867 --> 26:44.602
where you can kind of
read between the lines,

26:44.669 --> 26:46.638
they don't happen as often
as they probably should,

26:46.705 --> 26:50.041
{\an1}so when Ashley was in school,
I'm thinking she's good.

26:50.108 --> 26:53.478
{\an4}She goes away to Nashville,
she's at school, and she's
away from Memphis

26:53.545 --> 26:56.214
{\an5}and away from all the
drama and she's kind of
just handling her books

26:56.281 --> 26:59.417
but not realizing that
the bigger picture is that

26:59.484 --> 27:02.053
{\an4}her mother has
three other children
that are below her,

27:02.120 --> 27:05.357
{\an1}so in her mind, she's like,
well, if Mommy goes away,

27:05.423 --> 27:07.125
I've automatically
inherited the kingdom.

27:07.192 --> 27:09.327
{\an5}Now I have to take
care of my siblings.

27:07.192 --> 27:09.327
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

27:09.394 --> 27:12.297
And that was weighing on
her while away at school

27:12.364 --> 27:16.534
{\an5}and it kind of created
a situation where she
couldn't focus.

27:16.601 --> 27:19.070
{\an5}(Nina)
So the plan is, if something
does happen to her mother

27:19.137 --> 27:23.208
{\an5}and she has to go away,
your daughter would take
care of the siblings and...

27:19.137 --> 27:23.208
{\an3}No.

27:23.274 --> 27:26.077
Ashley will not be in charge
of the family at that point.

27:26.144 --> 27:29.247
{\an4}Ashley is going to go
to school and do what
she needs to do,

27:29.314 --> 27:31.349
{\an5}because if you can't
help yourself, you can't
help the next person,

27:31.416 --> 27:33.284
{\an5}and I'm a firm believer
in that.

27:31.416 --> 27:33.284
Right. That's very true.

27:33.351 --> 27:35.487
(applause)

27:35.553 --> 27:38.056
Remy, let me take it
to you for a second,

27:38.123 --> 27:40.525
'cause I know you're very vocal
about the court system.

27:40.592 --> 27:44.062
What does Miracle have to look
forward to for this trial?

27:44.129 --> 27:45.930
In all honesty, like,

27:45.997 --> 27:48.700
{\an7}I don't think she should
go to trial. Like...

27:48.767 --> 27:51.536
{\an5}You think she should
take the plea?

27:48.767 --> 27:51.536
{\an1}Yeah.

27:51.603 --> 27:53.271
'Cause it weighs
on your children.

27:53.338 --> 27:55.507
{\an4}Like, what people
don't understand with
the prison system

27:55.573 --> 27:57.709
{\an1}is it doesn't just effect
the person that got arrested.

27:57.776 --> 28:01.780
{\an4}It affects the entire
family and anybody that
cares about them.

28:01.846 --> 28:06.251
{\an5}Kimbella, do you agree with
Remy as how much it affects
everybody else around you?

28:06.317 --> 28:10.055
{\an5}'Cause there are several
children involved in
this as well.

28:10.121 --> 28:15.326
{\an7}For us, and it's unfortunate
that children have to sit there

28:15.393 --> 28:17.529
and actually deal
with this as well.

28:17.595 --> 28:20.498
{\an1}Like, we're adults, yes.
You know, we should suffer

28:20.565 --> 28:23.134
{\an1}the consequences of
anything that we do wrong,

28:23.201 --> 28:26.271
but when there's children
involved and their parent

28:26.337 --> 28:31.609
{\an4}has to be away from them
for however many years,
it breaks my heart.

28:31.676 --> 28:36.181
{\an5}Yandy, is there any advice
that you can offer to Rich
in this situation as well?

28:36.247 --> 28:41.519
{\an8}This is something that
really tests the strength

28:41.586 --> 28:43.755
of that inner heart
you got.

28:43.822 --> 28:46.991
{\an5}Everybody has a
heart but everybody
don't have heart.

28:43.822 --> 28:46.991
{\an1}Correct.

28:47.058 --> 28:49.094
You understand?
And you have definitely

28:49.160 --> 28:51.463
demonstrated a man
with a whole lot of heart.

28:51.529 --> 28:54.666
{\an1}Your daughter's going to
need you, so those FaceTimes

28:54.732 --> 28:56.835
and those phone calls
are not gonna be enough.

28:56.901 --> 28:59.304
{\an5}You're gonna have
to get on that plane
and get out there.

28:59.370 --> 29:01.339
That's my advice.

29:01.406 --> 29:06.611
{\an5}We're all gonna send good
vibes to her and hope for
the best possible outcome.

29:06.678 --> 29:10.548
{\an5}Coming up, we're talking to
the Mackies about the debut
of the golden child.

29:10.615 --> 29:12.951
More "Love &amp; Hip Hop"
when the reunion returns.

29:13.017 --> 29:16.688
{\an8}Is there any more babies
coming or are you guys good
right now with the golden child

29:16.754 --> 29:20.658
{\an8}or do you guys see
another baby soon?

29:20.725 --> 29:22.494
{\an8}Alexis, we're just gonna
jump right into it.

29:22.560 --> 29:24.195
{\an8}There were a lot of people
who criticized you.

29:24.262 --> 29:25.630
{\an7}At the end of the day,
I knew who I was sleeping with.

29:25.697 --> 29:26.898
{\an8}Yeah.

29:25.697 --> 29:26.898
{\an9}Okay?

29:26.965 --> 29:29.467
{\an8}Everybody (bleep)
at the end of the day.

29:29.534 --> 29:30.735
{\an9}Amen!

29:36.574 --> 29:38.810
(cheers and applause)

29:38.877 --> 29:41.779
Welcome back to "Love
&amp; Hip Hop: The Reunion."

29:41.846 --> 29:46.017
{\an5}Now, once in a blue moon,
you find the type of connection
that Remy and Pap have,

29:46.084 --> 29:49.854
and this season, we watched
as the ambassadors of Black Love

29:49.921 --> 29:52.657
prepared for the birth
of the golden child.

29:52.724 --> 29:53.758
Let's take a look.

29:56.928 --> 29:58.596
{\an8}(Papoose)
History in the making, baby.

29:58.663 --> 30:00.064
{\an8}The golden child is here.

30:00.131 --> 30:02.634
{\an8}(Remy)
Surprise, it's a girl!

30:02.700 --> 30:09.674
{\an8}I'd like to introduce you
to Reminisce MacKenzie Mackie.

30:09.741 --> 30:12.777
(cheers and applause)

30:12.844 --> 30:16.548
{\an5}Congratulations.
Can we talk about
the baby's name?

30:12.844 --> 30:16.548
Yes.

30:16.614 --> 30:18.149
Is she a junior?

30:18.216 --> 30:21.019
{\an5}She is a better me.

30:18.216 --> 30:21.019
Okay.

30:21.085 --> 30:23.254
{\an8}'Cause everyone's like,
"Oh, your daughter's gonna
give you everything."

30:23.321 --> 30:24.822
{\an8}No. See, I was
contaminated by the world.

30:24.889 --> 30:26.724
{\an5}She's not gonna...

30:24.889 --> 30:26.724
Okay.

30:26.791 --> 30:29.227
{\an5}She's not gonna get that.
She's gonna be a nice,
wholesome little girl

30:29.294 --> 30:32.197
{\an5}and she's not gonna
have to, you know,
show her ghetto side,

30:32.263 --> 30:34.265
but I think that
she's a better me.

30:34.332 --> 30:36.334
{\an5}So in true rapper
fashion, you gave
your baby a remix name.

30:36.401 --> 30:38.369
{\an5}Yeah, yeah.

30:36.401 --> 30:38.369
Okay.
(laughs)

30:38.436 --> 30:39.971
She's so beautiful,
like, literally.

30:40.038 --> 30:42.307
You know how some babies come
out and they look like aliens?

30:42.373 --> 30:44.375
Her head was round.
She had all this hair.

30:44.442 --> 30:46.878
{\an5}Pap told me I can't
touch her hair.

30:44.442 --> 30:46.878
Yeah, don't...
don't bother.

30:46.945 --> 30:48.980
He's had every
bald-headed excuses.

30:49.047 --> 30:53.418
{\an4}"When I was a baby, my
mother did XYZ to my hair.
That's why I'm bald headed."

30:53.484 --> 30:55.486
We have to talk a little bit
about this ride to the hospital,

30:55.553 --> 30:57.322
{\an5}'cause you were
in a full suit.

30:55.553 --> 30:57.322
{\an1}Yes.

30:57.388 --> 31:00.024
{\an5}A 19-piece suit.

30:57.388 --> 31:00.024
Why were you in a suit?

31:00.091 --> 31:02.860
{\an5}Well, the first time
my daughter see me...

31:00.091 --> 31:02.860
{\an3}Yeah.

31:02.927 --> 31:04.796
{\an6}Yeah.

31:02.927 --> 31:04.796
...'cause I knew it was
a girl the whole time...

31:04.862 --> 31:07.932
{\an8}I wanted her to see
a better version of her father,

31:07.999 --> 31:09.300
{\an5}a professional version.

31:07.999 --> 31:09.300
Oh, I love that.

31:09.367 --> 31:12.103
You know, I'm gonna
show her... Thank you.

31:12.170 --> 31:14.906
{\an1}(laughs)

31:12.170 --> 31:14.906
You know what?

31:14.973 --> 31:16.608
(laughter)

31:16.674 --> 31:19.310
{\an5}(Nina)
Okay, so let's talk about
this new parent schedule.

31:19.377 --> 31:22.647
{\an5}How are you dealing?

31:19.377 --> 31:22.647
{\an1}Um, she's actually...
I swear, I know this sounds

31:22.714 --> 31:24.349
like I keep saying it,
but she's really perfect.

31:24.415 --> 31:26.317
{\an6}Okay.

31:24.415 --> 31:26.317
{\an1}Like, she's literally
in my dressing room right now

31:26.384 --> 31:29.254
{\an5}and she's calm,
she hasn't cried,
she doesn't wake up

31:29.320 --> 31:31.623
unless Maino's screaming
in the room next to her.

31:31.689 --> 31:32.924
(laughter)

31:32.991 --> 31:35.393
{\an8}Not living up to my
inner Papoose, right?

31:35.460 --> 31:37.228
{\an1}She's holding
her own bottle already.

31:37.295 --> 31:38.429
{\an5}At seven weeks?

31:37.295 --> 31:38.429
Rolling over.

31:38.496 --> 31:40.698
I swear, too, 'cause
Yandy didn't believe it.

31:40.765 --> 31:42.267
{\an1}She was like, "You know,
I used to tell lies

31:42.333 --> 31:44.235
{\an1}about the great things my kids
did all the time too."

31:44.302 --> 31:47.305
{\an8}It's so true. I went over
there, I think, after
a week the baby was born,

31:47.372 --> 31:49.807
{\an5}and she had the crib
all protected. I'm like,
"Remy, it's okay.

31:49.874 --> 31:51.576
She's not going anywhere.
She's not even rolling."

31:51.643 --> 31:53.945
{\an5}She was like, "Oh,
my baby rolls. My baby
does all kinds of..."

31:54.012 --> 31:57.215
{\an5}I'm like, "What?"
And I didn't believe her,
and sure enough,

31:57.282 --> 32:00.385
{\an5}she sent me a video
of the baby rolling and
holding her own bottle.

32:00.451 --> 32:02.420
{\an5}(Nina)
Now, are you guys
gonna get a nanny?

32:02.487 --> 32:06.124
{\an5}I'm the nanny.

32:02.487 --> 32:06.124
Okay, okay.

32:06.190 --> 32:09.294
Is Pap's service
voluntary?

32:09.360 --> 32:11.763
Okay, so can we talk a little
bit about the song tribute?

32:11.829 --> 32:13.765
You put the heartbeat
on a song, right?

32:13.831 --> 32:16.567
{\an5}Yes, 'cause when
you're doing in vitro,
there's not a guarantee

32:16.634 --> 32:17.902
{\an5}that you're gonna hear
a heartbeat.

32:16.634 --> 32:17.902
{\an3}Okay.

32:17.969 --> 32:19.671
So, for me, that was
the first sign of life.

32:19.737 --> 32:22.974
{\an5}♪ I sing to your mama
'til I make she say
I am annoying ♪

32:23.041 --> 32:24.642
♪ Won't you shut up
and just go to sleep? ♪

32:24.709 --> 32:26.711
♪ I don't want to
hear it boy ♪

32:26.778 --> 32:28.513
{\an5}You had to put that...

32:26.778 --> 32:28.513
{\an1}I had to.

32:28.579 --> 32:30.715
{\an5}...so we all could listen.

32:28.579 --> 32:30.715
{\an1}Yes, the world... the
world need to hear that.

32:30.782 --> 32:33.251
(applause)

32:33.318 --> 32:36.454
{\an4}Is there any more babies
coming or are you guys good
right now with the golden child

32:36.521 --> 32:38.690
or do you guys see
another baby soon?

32:38.756 --> 32:41.392
{\an1}She said as long as I don't
spoil the golden child,

32:41.459 --> 32:44.562
{\an6}Oh, okay.

32:41.459 --> 32:44.562
{\an1}in 2020,
we can do it again.

32:44.629 --> 32:47.799
(cheers and applause)

32:47.865 --> 32:51.069
{\an5}That's what she said.

32:47.865 --> 32:51.069
What had happened was...

32:51.135 --> 32:52.503
(laughter)

32:52.570 --> 32:54.372
{\an5}You just think of it
like you have a baby
and that's it.

32:54.439 --> 32:57.342
{\an4}You don't really
realize how many
things can go wrong.

32:57.408 --> 33:00.712
{\an5}He was actually
scared during that.
I was hemorrhaging.

33:00.778 --> 33:02.747
{\an6}Really?

33:00.778 --> 33:02.747
I had to have three
blood transfusions.

33:02.814 --> 33:05.350
{\an8}Oh, my God!

33:02.814 --> 33:05.350
{\an8}Yeah, I had to have
three blood transfusions.

33:05.416 --> 33:07.985
{\an5}I had emergency surgery,
and I ended up staying
in the hospital,

33:08.052 --> 33:10.888
{\an5}like, an extra
couple of days.

33:08.052 --> 33:10.888
It was a scary
moment for me

33:10.955 --> 33:13.024
{\an4}because it kind of
reminded me of when
she went away,

33:13.091 --> 33:15.059
{\an4}and I was like,
"Yo, nah, I don't want
to lose you again.

33:15.126 --> 33:17.428
{\an1}Let's put it on hold
having a child."

33:17.495 --> 33:22.667
{\an4}But now that she's better
and everything fine again,
I'm gonna keep that promise.

33:22.734 --> 33:25.436
{\an5}(Nina)
Thank you, guys,
for sharing that.

33:25.503 --> 33:27.572
When we return,
Alexis Skyy hits New York,

33:27.638 --> 33:29.974
ready to make her mark
on the music industry,

33:30.041 --> 33:33.778
{\an5}but will federal racketeering
charges against her label
erase those plans?

33:33.845 --> 33:36.848
You're watching "Love
&amp; Hip Hop: The Reunion."

33:36.914 --> 33:39.550
(cheers and applause)

33:39.617 --> 33:42.787
{\an7}Fetty is, like, looking at me
like, damn, bitch, did you
really (bleep) with him?

33:42.854 --> 33:45.590
{\an8}That really (bleep) up
my whole life.

33:45.656 --> 33:47.725
{\an8}(overlapping chatter)

33:52.964 --> 33:55.900
(cheers and applause)

33:55.967 --> 33:58.202
{\an5}(Nina)
Welcome back to "Love
&amp; Hip Hop: The Reunion."

33:58.269 --> 34:02.974
{\an5}Now, Alexis felt the "Skyy"
was the limit on her career
when she moved to New York,

34:03.040 --> 34:07.078
{\an5}but with Tr3way going the
wrong way, she found herself
brought back to earth

34:07.145 --> 34:10.148
in dealing with a paternity
issue that was giving her hell.

34:10.214 --> 34:11.315
Let's watch.

34:11.382 --> 34:13.351
♪♪

34:13.418 --> 34:15.786
Me and my ex Fetty had our
beautiful baby girl Alaiya

34:15.853 --> 34:18.889
and now I'm back in
my hometown in New Jersey.

34:18.956 --> 34:21.192
{\an8}I didn't know,
moving up here,

34:21.259 --> 34:23.661
{\an7}they wasn't gonna accept
her Medicaid.

34:23.728 --> 34:27.130
{\an8}Alaiya was diagnosed
with hydrocephalus,

34:27.197 --> 34:31.235
{\an8}which is a grade 4 brain bleed,
due to her being 1.4 pounds

34:31.302 --> 34:33.871
and the traumatic surgery
that I had.

34:33.938 --> 34:37.275
{\an8}I'm stressed out but
I'm also determined to
give Alaiya the best

34:37.341 --> 34:41.344
{\an8}and that's exactly why
I'm making a stop to
see Fetty today.

34:41.411 --> 34:46.451
{\an8}The longer I sit here
and wait for Fetty to show up,
the more annoyed I get.

34:46.516 --> 34:50.288
{\an5}The only think I ever wanted
from Fetty is for him to
be a father to Alaiya.

34:50.353 --> 34:52.956
{\an8}This whole Solo Lucci
thing, when I first
announced that I was,

34:53.024 --> 34:54.625
{\an8}you know, pregnant,
he made a little joke

34:54.692 --> 34:56.260
{\an8}like, "Oh, who knows
who the father is?"

34:56.327 --> 34:58.329
{\an8}So people just kept
running with it
to the point

34:58.396 --> 34:59.864
{\an8}where he started
believing. Like,

34:59.931 --> 35:01.933
{\an8}"Dude, I was never
pregnant when I
was with you.

35:01.999 --> 35:04.368
{\an5}I got pregnant after
my birthday. Like,
do the (bleep) math."

35:04.435 --> 35:07.672
{\an4}Every time you post
a picture of Alaiya,
they come at me 1,000 times,

35:07.738 --> 35:10.374
{\an1}so with all these people
badgering me and attacking me,

35:10.441 --> 35:12.810
{\an4}like, "You a deadbeat
daddy. You're not there
for your daughter.

35:12.877 --> 35:16.881
{\an4}You this, you that," at the
end of the day, the best
thing I could do for myself

35:16.948 --> 35:22.119
{\an4}is just say,
"Hey, I don't know."

35:16.948 --> 35:22.119
I'm gonna do the test
and just get it over with.

35:22.186 --> 35:24.455
So, Alexis, we're just
gonna jump right into it.

35:24.522 --> 35:27.625
There were a lot of people who
criticized you for being open

35:27.692 --> 35:31.929
{\an5}and talking about the
troubles that you were having,
including using Medicaid.

35:31.996 --> 35:35.099
{\an5}What do you have to say to
the people that were throwing
shade at you for that?

35:35.166 --> 35:37.668
{\an8}First of all, I'm personally
not on Medicaid.

35:37.735 --> 35:42.807
{\an5}My daughter was born
premature, so if you
have a premature child,

35:42.874 --> 35:44.876
automatically,
you're qualified for that.

35:44.942 --> 35:49.280
{\an5}At the end of the day,
my daughter was
one pound, four ounces,

35:49.347 --> 35:53.784
{\an5}Oh!

35:49.347 --> 35:53.784
so every day in
the NICU was $20,000.

35:53.851 --> 35:56.654
{\an5}I'm not that rich. I'm not
gonna sit here and act
like I'm that rich,

35:56.721 --> 35:59.423
{\an4}but if my daughter is gonna
get covered for everything
that she needs,

35:59.490 --> 36:02.660
{\an5}just like her therapy
and everything else,
I'ma take it, so...

36:02.727 --> 36:04.095
You've got nothing
to be ashamed of.

36:04.161 --> 36:05.530
(applause)

36:05.596 --> 36:07.265
And something else was
cleared up this season as well.

36:07.331 --> 36:08.799
{\an3}Who, Lucci?

36:07.331 --> 36:08.799
{\an1}Yes.

36:08.866 --> 36:10.434
{\an6}Okay.

36:08.866 --> 36:10.434
{\an1}We know
that Solo Lucci...

36:10.501 --> 36:11.802
Well, we don't even
want to give him energy

36:11.869 --> 36:13.371
because he
was never her father

36:13.437 --> 36:15.573
{\an4}because, at the end
of the day, I knew
who I was sleeping with.

36:15.640 --> 36:19.377
{\an4}Yeah.

36:15.640 --> 36:19.377
Okay? Everybody (bleep)
at the end of the day.

36:19.443 --> 36:21.979
{\an5}We all (bleep).
I'm just being
all the way 100.

36:22.046 --> 36:24.015
{\an5}Like, (bleep), yeah,
I was dealing with Lucci
at a point in time.

36:24.081 --> 36:28.586
{\an4}I was, okay? But when I
was messing with my baby's
father for almost four years

36:28.653 --> 36:30.655
and I messed with him
around my birthday,

36:30.721 --> 36:33.991
{\an5}yeah, I got pregnant
by him, not by Lucci.

36:30.721 --> 36:33.991
{\an1}Right.

36:34.058 --> 36:36.027
{\an5}So when Lucci was
sitting here, trying
to make me look like

36:36.093 --> 36:37.762
{\an5}I didn't know who
I was sleeping with...

36:36.093 --> 36:37.762
{\an1}Right.

36:37.828 --> 36:40.731
{\an5}that (bleep) really
(bleep) up my whole
life for a whole...

36:40.798 --> 36:44.035
{\an5}almost...
'til I had Alaiya.

36:40.798 --> 36:44.035
{\an1}It really
did affect you.

36:44.101 --> 36:45.937
It affected me because,
at the end of the day,

36:46.003 --> 36:48.372
{\an4}Fetty's, like, looking at me
like, "Damn, bitch, did you
really (bleep) with him?"

36:48.439 --> 36:49.674
{\an1}Like, you know
what I'm saying?

36:49.740 --> 36:51.542
{\an5}He kind of believed it?

36:49.740 --> 36:51.542
I mean, who wouldn't?

36:51.609 --> 36:54.111
{\an5}I mean, if everybody's
constantly doing that
(bleep), like, come on.

36:54.178 --> 36:55.846
So all these people is
attacking me all day about

36:55.913 --> 36:58.282
{\an1}what my daughter looks like
and who she looks like.

36:58.349 --> 36:59.784
{\an4}Yeah.

36:58.349 --> 36:59.784
My daughter's
a miracle baby.

36:59.850 --> 37:03.387
Fetty knows that and that's
why he's here to this day.

37:03.454 --> 37:06.390
I'm in a whole new
relationship. I'm happy.

37:06.457 --> 37:08.726
Alaiya's good.
She's healthy.

37:08.793 --> 37:10.895
Fetty is around her
and I'm good.

37:10.962 --> 37:13.631
{\an5}I mean, listen,
this was a glow-up,
so I'm here for it, okay?

37:13.698 --> 37:15.666
All right, now, you guys,
don't move.

37:15.733 --> 37:18.970
{\an5}We're looking back at some
of the craziest moments
this season had to offer

37:19.036 --> 37:20.805
and you definitely
don't want to miss this.

37:20.871 --> 37:22.707
This is "Love &amp;
Hip Hop: The Reunion."

37:22.773 --> 37:24.609
(cheers and applause)

37:24.675 --> 37:28.045
{\an8}Pap, I heard you have
a surprise for everyone.

37:28.112 --> 37:31.649
{\an7}Yes.

37:28.112 --> 37:31.649
{\an9}Oh, my God!

37:31.716 --> 37:33.384
{\an8}(cheering)

37:31.716 --> 37:33.384
{\an9}Hey!

37:39.590 --> 37:45.062
(cheers and applause)

37:45.129 --> 37:49.033
{\an5}All right, welcome back
to the conclusion of "Love
&amp; Hip Hop: The Reunion."

37:49.100 --> 37:53.004
Now it is time to take one
last look back at a season

37:53.070 --> 37:56.073
that brought bended knees,
sex toys, and meltdowns.

37:56.140 --> 37:58.576
Whoo, child!
Let's check it out.

37:58.643 --> 38:03.080
{\an8}Here we go, here we go,
here we go, here we go!

38:03.147 --> 38:04.248
{\an8}♪♪

38:04.315 --> 38:06.684
{\an8}Good morning, everybody!

38:06.751 --> 38:10.087
{\an8}Cheers to happiness.
(laughs)

38:10.154 --> 38:13.557
{\an7}And cheers to a nice
little twerk. Ay!

38:10.154 --> 38:13.557
{\an9}Ooh!

38:13.624 --> 38:15.993
{\an8}Give me that.
Ah, ah, ah!

38:13.624 --> 38:15.993
{\an7}It's looks good.
I like it.

38:16.060 --> 38:18.095
{\an7}You know when you eat
and it just makes you
want to do the happy dance?

38:18.162 --> 38:20.131
{\an7}Work it!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

38:20.197 --> 38:24.669
{\an9}Get some!

38:20.197 --> 38:24.669
{\an7}Ooh! I'm like,
oh, that's not Joey.

38:24.735 --> 38:25.903
{\an8}We're fighting about sex.

38:25.970 --> 38:27.171
{\an8}Because she doesn't
want to have sex?

38:27.238 --> 38:29.040
{\an7}I need to get (bleep)
in that pool right there.

38:29.106 --> 38:30.541
{\an7}Oh, no, she wants
to have sex.

38:30.608 --> 38:32.109
{\an7}I need the man to (bleep) me
like how he used to.

38:32.176 --> 38:33.344
{\an8}Uh-uh-uh-uh!

38:32.176 --> 38:33.344
{\an9}Yes!

38:33.411 --> 38:35.112
{\an8}Sometimes you gotta
just take control

38:35.179 --> 38:36.814
{\an8}of the situation.

38:36.881 --> 38:38.015
{\an8}All right, pull
your (bleep) out.

38:38.082 --> 38:40.317
{\an8}Do I have to be, like...
like, rock (bleep),

38:40.384 --> 38:43.087
{\an8}semi (bleep),
or almost (bleep)?

38:43.154 --> 38:45.656
{\an8}I want to be able
to take a 10-incher.

38:45.723 --> 38:46.824
{\an7}All right.

38:46.891 --> 38:48.292
{\an7}Let's just change
this whole conversation.

38:48.359 --> 38:50.061
{\an8}At the end of the day...

38:48.359 --> 38:50.061
{\an8}At the end of the day...

38:50.127 --> 38:51.896
{\an8}At the end of the day...

38:50.127 --> 38:51.896
{\an8}At the end of the day, J...

38:51.962 --> 38:53.731
{\an8}At the end of the day...

38:51.962 --> 38:53.731
{\an9}It's good.

38:53.798 --> 38:54.832
{\an8}Whoo, child!

38:54.899 --> 38:57.168
{\an7}Huh.

38:54.899 --> 38:57.168
{\an8}Uh-uh!

38:57.234 --> 39:00.604
{\an8}(bleep)!

38:57.234 --> 39:00.604
{\an8}Oh, my (bleep) God.

39:00.671 --> 39:05.076
{\an8}I like Jaguar.

39:00.671 --> 39:05.076
{\an7}"Jaguar"?
(laughs)

39:05.142 --> 39:06.310
{\an8}A person that
you don't...

39:06.377 --> 39:08.579
{\an8}Excuse me, guys.
It's cheeseburger o'clock.

39:08.646 --> 39:09.647
{\an8}(belches) Oops.

39:09.714 --> 39:10.715
{\an8}Don't bite
my cheeseburger.

39:10.781 --> 39:11.949
{\an8}I'm not gonna
eat your food.

39:12.016 --> 39:13.617
{\an8}I didn't say "eat it,"
I said, "don't bite it."

39:13.684 --> 39:16.087
{\an8}Let me lick one
of your nipples.

39:13.684 --> 39:16.087
{\an7}I'm down.

39:16.153 --> 39:17.488
{\an8}Oh, my God!

39:17.555 --> 39:20.024
{\an9}Oh, my God!

39:17.555 --> 39:20.024
{\an8}What is in that drink?

39:20.091 --> 39:21.692
{\an9}Check!

39:20.091 --> 39:21.692
{\an8}(laughter)

39:21.759 --> 39:27.298
(cheers and applause)

39:27.364 --> 39:31.368
{\an5}Now, we heard a lot of
"at the end of the day"
in the best-of clip,

39:31.435 --> 39:34.371
so instead of final words,
I want some of you guys

39:34.438 --> 39:37.475
to finish the sentence,
"At the end of the day..." what?

39:37.541 --> 39:38.676
Life goes on.

39:38.743 --> 39:40.778
It is what it is.

39:40.845 --> 39:43.614
{\an8}At the end of the day,
we are all human

39:43.681 --> 39:48.519
{\an4}and we all share
the same struggles,
different life paths,

39:48.586 --> 39:51.889
{\an1}but we should respect
each other as human beings.

39:51.956 --> 39:53.224
{\an5}(Nina)
Okay, that was
a good one.

39:53.290 --> 39:56.494
Pap, I heard you have
a surprise for everyone.

39:56.560 --> 39:59.296
Yes, actually, I do.

39:59.363 --> 40:01.298
{\an1}I got this new sneaker
right here.

40:01.365 --> 40:02.967
{\an8}It's called Black Love.
Give it to the ladies.

40:03.033 --> 40:04.535
{\an5}Really?

40:03.033 --> 40:04.535
(cheers and applause)

40:04.602 --> 40:06.137
A man is supposed to
cater to his queen,

40:06.203 --> 40:08.873
{\an1}so when your feet are up,
the "Black Love" will show.

40:08.939 --> 40:10.441
{\an5}Oh, I love that!

40:08.939 --> 40:10.441
Oh!

40:10.508 --> 40:12.309
{\an4}A'ight.

40:10.508 --> 40:12.309
(applause)

40:14.078 --> 40:18.215
"So, at the end of the day..."
Finish the sentence, Juelz.

40:18.282 --> 40:21.385
{\an8}At the end of the day,
life is short.

40:21.452 --> 40:25.322
{\an7}Cherish every moment.
And when the cameras is on,

40:25.389 --> 40:31.162
{\an5}people gotta learn how to
accept things the same way
as when the cameras is off

40:31.228 --> 40:34.899
{\an5}and stop trying to
always be in that defense
mechanism, you know?

40:34.965 --> 40:39.670
{\an5}So, at the end of
the day, dwell on that
and figure it out.

40:34.965 --> 40:39.670
Live your truth.

40:39.737 --> 40:42.339
{\an5}(Nina)
Well, thank you so much,
Juelz. I know it'll be
a little bit of time

40:42.406 --> 40:46.277
{\an5}before we see you, but we
will be praying for you,
we're thinking about you.

40:46.343 --> 40:48.813
{\an6}Thank you.

40:46.343 --> 40:48.813
You're a cast member here
always, and family,

40:48.879 --> 40:50.548
so we definitely
wish you the best.

40:50.614 --> 40:53.884
(applause)

40:53.951 --> 40:55.586
Thanks for watching
"Love &amp; Hip Hop: The Reunion,"

40:55.653 --> 40:57.454
but it's time for us
to get out of here.

40:57.521 --> 40:59.857
Make sure you tune in next week
for the season premiere

40:59.924 --> 41:02.893
of "Love &amp; Hip Hop: Atlanta"
and stay tuned tonight

41:02.960 --> 41:07.131
{\an5}for both the finale
and the reunion of
"Love &amp; Hip Hop: Miami."

41:07.198 --> 41:09.667
I'm your host Nina Parker
signing off. Good night.

41:09.733 --> 41:13.370
(cheers and applause)

41:13.437 --> 41:14.438
{\an3}Yes!

41:14.505 --> 41:17.441
(cheers and applause)
