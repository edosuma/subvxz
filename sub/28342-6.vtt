WEBVTT

00:07.925 --> 00:09.194
Congratulations, Madam President.

00:09.218 --> 00:11.301
Thank you. It's very exciting.
Yes, we're thrilled.

00:11.428 --> 00:14.796
The woman who freed Tibet is finally
getting her Nobel Peace Prize.

00:14.890 --> 00:16.973
Technically, not a Peace Prize, ma'am.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.807
You've won the Summit Peace Award

00:18.894 --> 00:21.102
of the World Summit
of Nobel Peace Laureates.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.788
It's kind of like
the Peace Prize Junior.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.876
The American voters
don't know the difference,

00:24.900 --> 00:26.357
and, frankly, neither do I.

00:26.443 --> 00:29.130
Ma'am, I'm headed back to the hotel
to work on your acceptance speech.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.994
Okay, I don't know what
that's a euphemism for,

00:31.198 --> 00:34.236
but, Leon, you need to
really lay it on thick.

00:34.326 --> 00:37.114
- Okay? Tibet, Tibet, Tibet.
- You bet, you bet, you bet.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.036
I wanna sound like Bono
trying to impress

00:39.122 --> 00:40.704
his own reflection in the mirror.

00:40.791 --> 00:42.748
- I understand.
- Yeah. Good.

00:42.834 --> 00:45.372
Hey. Was that Colonel Al-Saleh,

00:45.462 --> 00:47.875
the Butcher of Juba, back there
by the carving station?

00:48.006 --> 00:50.566
The Nobel people don't ask too
many questions if you buy a table.

00:50.634 --> 00:53.238
Ma'am, at this point, they're just
trying to avoid losing the building.

00:53.262 --> 00:55.845
My Nobel Prize really makes the point

00:55.931 --> 00:59.345
that I've got way more foreign policy
experience than that half-wit Kemi.

00:59.685 --> 01:01.221
I think it's pronounced "half-white."

01:01.311 --> 01:03.268
Well, "tomato, mulatto."

01:03.355 --> 01:05.792
Hey, ma'am, Catherine and Marjorie's
wedding is in three weeks,

01:05.816 --> 01:07.227
and her and her wedding planner...

01:07.317 --> 01:09.559
Okay, can you just say you?
You and Catherine.

01:09.653 --> 01:12.340
We're a little concerned about sitting
you next to Marjorie's shaman.

01:12.364 --> 01:14.276
- Hello!
- Congratulations, Mom.

01:14.366 --> 01:15.652
Thank you very much.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.576
So, I understand we're having
some sort of a seating issue?

01:18.662 --> 01:20.654
Whatever you gals want is fine by me

01:20.747 --> 01:22.158
as long as someone lets me have

01:22.291 --> 01:24.352
mini-vegan pigs in gluten-free
blankets at the reception.

01:24.376 --> 01:26.368
- Oh, God.
- Listen, darling,

01:26.503 --> 01:29.120
why don't you get married
over here in Europe?

01:29.214 --> 01:32.252
Because without
an American marriage license,

01:32.426 --> 01:35.669
U.S. community property laws
do not apply, my darling.

01:35.762 --> 01:37.657
- Marjorie is my soul mate forever.
- That's fine.

01:37.681 --> 01:39.117
I don't know why you
would bring this up...

01:39.141 --> 01:40.598
You and your maid of honor here

01:40.684 --> 01:43.472
can sit me next to
whatever Injun Joe you want.

01:43.645 --> 01:45.056
It's your special day, so...

01:45.147 --> 01:46.934
- Thank you, Mother.
- You're welcome.

01:47.566 --> 01:49.808
- I don't have a drink.
- I'll get it.

01:50.027 --> 01:55.318
Um, when am I getting my meeting with
President Lu about the Montez stuff?

01:55.407 --> 01:57.447
- Oh, I can't hear you.
- Legally not present.

01:57.534 --> 02:03.075
Guys, listen. I just need to get in
a room with Lu, one-on-one,

02:03.165 --> 02:05.703
so I can change his mind
about supporting me for president.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.954
Face-to-face, I can
convince anyone of anything.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.187
- That's not true.
- Incorrect.

02:09.211 --> 02:10.211
You're both wrong.

02:10.297 --> 02:11.754
- Well, you're right.
- Okay?

02:11.840 --> 02:13.672
Ma'am, Lu's people
have been Great-Walling us.

02:13.759 --> 02:15.320
I don't think they're
anxious to meet with you.

02:15.344 --> 02:16.738
That's why I brought along some bait.

02:16.762 --> 02:17.798
- Selina!
- Minna!

02:18.680 --> 02:19.761
Oh, Minna!

02:20.682 --> 02:24.426
Lu developed a real hankering for
Finnish furburger back at Camp David.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.636
He eye-fucked her so bad
he got retinal herpes.

02:26.730 --> 02:27.730
Minna!

02:27.814 --> 02:29.225
- Selina!
- Oh...

02:30.025 --> 02:31.891
- I don't get the attraction.
- Oh, I do.

02:35.906 --> 02:38.319
So, my last three lovers,
they are complaining

02:38.408 --> 02:41.116
that my naughty talk
is both incessant and soporific.

02:41.203 --> 02:43.160
Maybe you should let them choke you.

02:43.246 --> 02:45.600
You think they would rather choke me
than listen to me talk?

02:45.624 --> 02:47.286
I can only speak for myself.

02:47.376 --> 02:49.163
You know, where is Lu?

02:49.252 --> 02:51.619
- Selina Meyer!
- Murman!

02:51.713 --> 02:55.002
Oh, my gosh,
I didn't know you were still alive.

02:55.092 --> 02:57.880
The Russians reinstalled me
when they invaded Georgia.

02:57.969 --> 02:59.489
- Oh, good for you.
- Huh! Factory reboot.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.096
Beep-boop-beep-beep-boop.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.423
A bit of personal news.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.260
I recently bought
an English football club.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.844
- Oh, wonderful!
- Leeds United.

03:07.938 --> 03:10.351
No English players,
so pretty good team.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.853
- Oh.
- Selina, crazy idea I have.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.939
What if I gave you money
to help you win your election?

03:16.363 --> 03:21.575
America does not stand for
foreign interference in our elections!

03:21.660 --> 03:23.721
- Who do you think that I am?
- Yes, of course. Of course.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.973
- I mean, it's an outrage!
- Yeah, yeah. New topic. New topic.

03:25.997 --> 03:29.661
I want to buy your
Palm Beach house for $114 million.

03:29.751 --> 03:32.368
Well, needless to say,
real estate is a different animal.

03:32.462 --> 03:33.815
They're not making
any more of it, right?

03:33.839 --> 03:35.455
Everybody's gotta live somewhere.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.417
I'd rather deal with the Russian mob
than with those real estate people.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.697
Well, it's because they're unethical,
that's what they are.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.281
Because they are working
on commissions.

03:42.347 --> 03:43.838
Yes! 6%.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.076
It's abject greed, in my view.

03:45.100 --> 03:47.592
- And I...
- The $114 million would be wired

03:47.686 --> 03:49.678
from the Seychelles to Malta,

03:49.771 --> 03:52.354
then back to the Seychelles,
and then to you.

03:52.441 --> 03:54.808
I'm very flattered,
Murman, I really am,

03:54.901 --> 03:57.268
but your timing is horrendous.

03:57.529 --> 04:00.488
To live is to suffer, Selina.
The human condition.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.735
- Yes.
- Ha!

04:01.825 --> 04:03.345
- White people problems, right?
- Okay.

04:04.703 --> 04:06.695
Thank you. Thank you, Murman.

04:07.497 --> 04:08.558
You were right, ma'am.

04:08.582 --> 04:11.165
Lu's looking for the tickee
in someone's shirtee.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.412
What's the word, Minna?

04:12.502 --> 04:15.620
President Lu will meet you
in the West Salon in ten minutes.

04:15.714 --> 04:18.457
- He seems quite excited.
- Yeah, we could see that from here.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.088
- Keith.
- Oh, hi.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.261
- Where is Lu?
- You don't get to see Lu.

04:23.346 --> 04:25.303
You need to go through me,
that's how this works.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.178
I know all about Lu's secret plan

04:28.268 --> 04:31.181
to get President Montez
elected for a second term.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.308
So you go, and you tell Lu

04:33.398 --> 04:35.606
that I want to talk
to him directly, right now.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.935
You're going to do
exactly what we say.

04:39.029 --> 04:40.190
- I'm sorry?
- Or else,

04:40.280 --> 04:42.146
we'll tell the whole world
how you vaporized

04:42.240 --> 04:44.277
a DRA leader's wedding
with Hellfire missiles

04:44.367 --> 04:47.360
and also took a huge laser-guided shit

04:47.496 --> 04:49.032
all over Pakistani sovereignty...

04:49.122 --> 04:51.455
Okay, A, that never happened.

04:51.541 --> 04:54.750
And B, that footage
is highly classified.

04:54.836 --> 04:57.078
It was classified,
until somebody on your staff

04:57.172 --> 04:59.539
clicked on
"Asian Girls Bound and Gagged."

05:00.926 --> 05:02.087
Oh, Ben.

05:02.677 --> 05:03.884
Or Kent.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.470
Or Leon. Oh, God.

05:06.598 --> 05:08.089
Or Marjorie. I mean...

05:08.558 --> 05:13.053
Jonah, your anti-vaccination message
is bringing together an unheard-of mix

05:13.188 --> 05:16.101
of Orthodox Jews,
uneducated fringe conspiracists,

05:16.191 --> 05:18.057
and Kombucha-douching
private school moms.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.483
That's the real America.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.856
So, we've got three more stops
this afternoon.

05:21.947 --> 05:24.307
Oh, look. If we go to Kentucky,
it's gonna look like a wang.

05:24.783 --> 05:26.775
The Great Lakes
will be like the spooey.

05:26.868 --> 05:29.485
Jonah, it's your dad again.
It's like the tenth time today.

05:29.621 --> 05:31.704
Hey, Siri, you fuck my dad?

05:31.790 --> 05:33.702
<i>I don't know
how to respond to that.</i>

05:33.917 --> 05:35.374
- Typical woman.
- I know.

05:35.460 --> 05:36.854
- That's mine.
- Clay, come on. Let's go.

05:36.878 --> 05:39.621
All right. How you doing, Harrisburg!

05:39.714 --> 05:41.546
Yeah!

05:41.758 --> 05:44.751
Pennsylvania, you have
the second-lowest

05:44.845 --> 05:46.802
vaccination rate in the nation,

05:46.972 --> 05:50.932
and when I am elected president,
you will be number one!

05:52.853 --> 05:54.640
- Thank you, Pennsylvania!
- Oh!

05:54.729 --> 05:57.472
Thank you! All right! Yeah!

05:57.691 --> 05:59.273
Oh!

05:59.359 --> 06:01.100
Oh, look at this baby. Aw.

06:02.988 --> 06:04.854
The menu has been an atrocity.

06:05.115 --> 06:06.151
The guests are vegan,

06:06.241 --> 06:08.281
and the president won't eat
anything without a face.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.235
Selina.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.696
I saw President Lu leaving.
Is everything all right?

06:13.790 --> 06:15.531
Yeah, everything's
completely fine, Minna.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.537
No. I can see the concern
in your eyes,

06:17.627 --> 06:19.163
even through all the procedures.

06:19.254 --> 06:20.694
What is it? Is it about the wedding?

06:22.132 --> 06:23.132
He told you?

06:23.216 --> 06:24.798
He would not stop talking about it.

06:24.926 --> 06:26.713
He used the phrase
"complete atrocity."

06:26.928 --> 06:28.840
Complete atrocity?

06:29.598 --> 06:31.464
Minna, listen.

06:32.976 --> 06:36.390
So I droned a couple wedding civilians

06:36.479 --> 06:38.345
on the wrong side
of the Af-Pak border.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.459
I thought you were talking
about your daughter's wedding

06:40.483 --> 06:42.019
to your homosexual doppelganger.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.652
Yes. I was.

06:46.698 --> 06:47.939
Um...

06:48.491 --> 06:50.983
"Droned a wedding"

06:51.453 --> 06:54.537
is, uh, American slang for

06:54.664 --> 06:56.601
- "I got it, I nailed it."
- Yeah, I do not think...

06:56.625 --> 06:59.413
No, no, no. Really.
Like, "I droned that wedding, man!"

06:59.544 --> 07:01.230
I do not think that
it is slang of any kind.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.871
Oh, I guarantee you it is.
Ask anyone here...

07:05.383 --> 07:06.499
Mike, we have made

07:07.010 --> 07:09.844
a lot of mistakes here at CBS News.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.549
I know, right?

07:12.807 --> 07:14.994
But I think you could be a big part
of turning that around.

07:15.018 --> 07:16.746
- Mmm-hmm.
- Okay. As a special correspondent,

07:16.770 --> 07:18.247
you will be everywhere
that there's news.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.933
And I don't think it hurts

07:20.023 --> 07:22.857
that you will be our
youngest correspondent, by a lot.

07:23.485 --> 07:24.485
Thank you, sir.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.047
- So we bought the <i>McLinTALK</i> name...
- Uh-huh.

07:26.071 --> 07:27.965
...but we did not get all
the intellectual property

07:27.989 --> 07:28.989
from the old show. So...

07:29.074 --> 07:31.031
- I have intellectual property?
- Oh, yeah!

07:31.117 --> 07:32.949
The classic <i>McLinTALK</i> bits.

07:33.036 --> 07:36.120
I mean, uh, when your phone rings
in the middle of an interview...

07:36.206 --> 07:38.744
- Oh. Oh. Yeah, yeah.
- And the horrible wife?

07:40.001 --> 07:41.958
- She's horrible!
- A lot of that stuff,

07:42.045 --> 07:44.231
uh, I didn't know I was doing
until people pointed it out.

07:44.255 --> 07:45.791
See? Keep that sense of humor.

07:46.007 --> 07:47.007
Okay.

07:47.217 --> 07:49.459
Because pretty much everything else
is gonna change.

07:49.678 --> 07:52.341
Selina, you have put me
in a terrible situation.

07:52.430 --> 07:54.513
You have just admitted
to being a war criminal.

07:55.100 --> 07:58.309
Do they give Nobel Peace Prizes
to war criminals, Minna?

07:58.395 --> 08:01.559
All the time. Aung San Suu Kyi,
Henry Kissinger,

08:01.648 --> 08:03.000
and also, the prize
that you're getting,

08:03.024 --> 08:04.265
it is not the Peace Prize.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.964
- Oh, don't start with that!
- It is a second-tier Peace Prize.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.588
- No.
- It is made of very hard plastic.

08:08.613 --> 08:11.651
You have left me with no choice.
I must report you.

08:11.741 --> 08:14.529
Okay. Well, then
you've left me with no choice.

08:15.286 --> 08:16.286
Ha!

08:16.454 --> 08:17.570
That was your phone.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.747
I called Interpol
before we got in the car.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.208
Come on, wait up.
Hey, hey... Minna.

08:22.293 --> 08:24.034
Just a second! Sweet Viking Christ!

08:24.129 --> 08:25.586
Come on!

08:25.672 --> 08:28.460
Just call Interpol back,
tell them that you made a mistake.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.166
I am sorry, Selina.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.580
I have a commitment to
the principles of truth and justice.

08:32.804 --> 08:35.511
As the former president
of the United States,

08:35.597 --> 08:38.761
truth and justice can gargle my balls.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.265
- Move the fuck out of my way.
- Ma'am, the ICC

08:41.354 --> 08:43.687
has issued a warrant
for your arrest for war crimes.

08:43.815 --> 08:46.023
Yeah. That's because
Autistic Barbie here

08:46.192 --> 08:48.605
tattled on me over
the wedding drone strike.

08:48.695 --> 08:50.982
- Which one?
- Nope. The DRA guy.

08:51.072 --> 08:52.472
- Which was the only one.
- Correct!

08:52.532 --> 08:54.051
Secret Service says
the Norwegian police

08:54.075 --> 08:55.691
are all over the airport
and the hotel.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.680
- Seriously?
- You will be extradited to the Hague

08:57.704 --> 08:59.946
and imprisoned under Article VIII
of the Rome Statute.

09:00.498 --> 09:03.866
Selina, if you request it,
I can offer you asylum.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.451
You can stay here at the embassy!

09:05.545 --> 09:08.162
I'd just as soon stay
at an Embassy Suites.

09:08.423 --> 09:11.291
Ma'am, it's your only shot.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.670
- Yeah.
- Really?

09:13.887 --> 09:14.887
Fine.

09:15.764 --> 09:16.845
I'll stay here.

09:17.098 --> 09:19.932
Good. Now you must
formally request asylum.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.560
Yeah, I'm just gonna go.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.385
They can shoot me
as I make a run for it.

09:23.480 --> 09:26.644
Fine. On behalf of the
Finnish Ambassador to Norway,

09:27.692 --> 09:29.024
I grant you asylum.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.483
She prefers the word "spa."

09:33.740 --> 09:36.278
Welcome to your new office,
Lieutenant Governor Splett.

09:36.451 --> 09:37.532
Here we go.

09:39.537 --> 09:42.325
Wait. What? No. This is where
you stick an unfuckable intern.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.415
Oh, no, no, no.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.352
When I was a summer intern
for Lieutenant Governor Plasko

09:45.376 --> 09:47.538
back in seventh grade,
I was in a much bigger office.

09:47.629 --> 09:50.167
We gotta get the morbidly obese
fuck out of Iowa.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.860
I mean, last night I tried to find
one non-chain restaurant to eat at,

09:52.884 --> 09:55.092
and Yelp basically told me
to go Fuddrucker myself.

09:55.178 --> 09:56.697
- Sounds like a settings issue.
- Okay. No.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.678
Listen, we gotta get you
national, Richard. Okay?

09:58.765 --> 10:00.576
So that's why I've already
booked you on <i>McLinTALK.</i>

10:00.600 --> 10:01.966
And I canceled it.

10:02.352 --> 10:03.593
Oh! Governor Ballentine!

10:03.686 --> 10:05.046
You think you're hot shit, Splett?

10:05.188 --> 10:06.804
First human mayor of Lurlene,

10:06.898 --> 10:08.959
straight to lieutenant governor
in just a few months.

10:08.983 --> 10:11.023
- Thank you.
- Well, now you're an ice-cold dog turd

10:11.069 --> 10:13.106
because you're not getting my job.

10:13.196 --> 10:14.858
Governor, we have
the utmost respect...

10:14.948 --> 10:16.428
Save it, Manhattan Date Rape Mystery.

10:16.574 --> 10:19.658
Splett, I'm gonna bury you so deep
in bullshit make-work

10:19.744 --> 10:22.361
people are gonna forget
Iowa even has a lieutenant governor.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.535
That shouldn't be too hard.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.411
<i>This is Michael McLintock...</i>

10:30.630 --> 10:33.418
<i>and it's time to McLintalk
with Michael McLintock</i>

10:33.508 --> 10:35.170
<i>on CBS International...</i>

10:35.260 --> 10:38.173
Yes, I'm still holding
for Secretary Doyle.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.504
- Mike looks good.
- Mmm, so much better.

10:40.598 --> 10:43.160
What's he doing? How long does
it take to change an adult diaper?

10:43.184 --> 10:44.703
<i>The Norwegian National Police
have surrounded</i>

10:44.727 --> 10:46.247
<i>the Finnish Embassy in Oslo, Norway...</i>

10:46.312 --> 10:47.428
Oh, my God in heaven.

10:47.522 --> 10:49.058
Selina, do you hate me?

10:49.149 --> 10:50.149
Minna, I'm on the phone.

10:50.233 --> 10:53.067
Ma'am, the White House refuses
to get involved in your situation.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.213
- What?
- Although publicly,

10:54.237 --> 10:55.957
Montez claims to be
considering all options.

10:56.030 --> 10:57.925
Privately, I heard she's been
doing impressions of you

10:57.949 --> 10:59.218
getting broom-sticked in prison.

10:59.242 --> 11:01.780
Are people actually laughing
at that impression?

11:01.870 --> 11:02.870
- No.
- Yes.

11:02.954 --> 11:05.662
Is this really just about
me reporting you to the ICC?

11:05.748 --> 11:07.865
Yeah. How long
am I supposed to be here?

11:07.959 --> 11:09.871
I could be dead
before you ever get outta here.

11:09.961 --> 11:12.578
Well, no offense, Ben, but honestly,
that could be, like, tonight.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.254
- God willing.
- I forgave you

11:14.340 --> 11:16.110
for not voting for me
to be the head of the IMF.

11:16.134 --> 11:18.501
Minna, you don't go to prison

11:18.720 --> 11:20.427
when you're not the head of the IMF.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.630
Just the prison of unmet potential.

11:22.724 --> 11:24.716
Ooh! Go sit in the corner, Minna! Go!

11:24.809 --> 11:26.926
- Here comes the shoes!
- Sit here.

11:27.145 --> 11:29.979
Guys, how is this affecting
my chances at the nomination?

11:30.064 --> 11:33.478
You need to get in touch with
the American Ambassador to Norway.

11:33.568 --> 11:36.982
Norway. Ambassador Costas
was Montez's husband's chiropractor.

11:37.071 --> 11:39.258
Yeah, he does most of his
ambassador-ing in Orlando.

11:39.282 --> 11:41.114
- Okay.
- Okay, that's everything.

11:41.201 --> 11:44.365
I have no space in this room!

11:44.454 --> 11:45.764
- I'll take it out.
- I cannot move!

11:45.788 --> 11:47.745
It's easy. We'll get it out.

11:49.375 --> 11:53.460
Selina, can I ask just one teeny,
tiny, very small question?

11:54.047 --> 11:55.047
Yeah.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.168
- Minna.
- Yeah.

11:57.258 --> 11:58.374
Yeah.

11:58.468 --> 12:00.425
From the bottom of my heart,

12:00.595 --> 12:03.713
I truly and completely forgive you.

12:04.098 --> 12:06.556
Now shut the living fuck up.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.851
I am just sorry that
I cannot forgive you

12:08.937 --> 12:10.724
for killing all those innocent people.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.263
Get out.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.974
- We are sharing a room.
- No, we're not.

12:19.948 --> 12:20.948
Yeah.

12:21.115 --> 12:23.402
Streptococksucker.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.280
Do you have the chicken pox?

12:25.370 --> 12:27.236
Clay gave them to me, yell at him.

12:27.330 --> 12:29.037
- No, I didn't.
- Clay!

12:29.123 --> 12:31.866
Oh, sweet pestilent Christ.
You need to see this.

12:32.168 --> 12:35.286
<i>...Disease Control is reporting
a large chicken pox outbreak</i>

12:35.380 --> 12:36.916
<i>in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.</i>

12:37.006 --> 12:38.838
Oh, wow.
We got out of there just in time.

12:38.925 --> 12:42.214
<i>That is the eighth chicken pox
outbreak in the last week,</i>

12:42.303 --> 12:44.886
<i>all in communities
with low vaccination rates</i>

12:44.973 --> 12:46.589
<i>but no other apparent connection.</i>

12:46.683 --> 12:48.766
Oh, my God, you Patient IQ Zero!

12:48.851 --> 12:51.719
You infected all those nutballs
who don't believe in vaccinations!

12:51.813 --> 12:52.813
Well, serves them right.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.417
Didn't you have
chicken pox as a child?

12:54.524 --> 12:57.483
Were you too busy bed-wetting
and cutting fuck-holes in watermelons?

12:57.568 --> 12:59.046
Ugh, Amy, that only works

12:59.070 --> 13:00.277
with fleshy melons.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.779
- Duh.
- Yeah. And sometimes pumpkins.

13:03.616 --> 13:04.616
- Daddy!
- Hi, Bethy.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.283
I'm really sorry I just showed up.

13:06.661 --> 13:07.661
Oh, no, no, no!

13:07.745 --> 13:09.431
I really wanna have a chance
to talk with you, Jonah.

13:09.455 --> 13:10.808
Can't you see I feel
yucky enough already?

13:10.832 --> 13:12.664
Jonah, I know that
you're angry with me.

13:12.750 --> 13:16.039
I hate you so much I could walk into
a supermarket and shoot everybody.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.462
It's all right to feel that way.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.419
I just want you to know
that I love you.

13:21.718 --> 13:24.301
And I hope someday
you'll give me another chance.

13:26.431 --> 13:27.431
Okay.

13:28.349 --> 13:29.965
Um, I beg your pardon?

13:32.228 --> 13:33.969
Okay, you can be my dad.

13:34.564 --> 13:36.021
I can be what?

13:37.317 --> 13:39.434
You can be my dad if you want.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.143
Oh, come here!

13:41.237 --> 13:43.024
Oh, I love you, Jonah.

13:43.114 --> 13:45.857
I love you too, Daddy. No homo.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.108
Sure. No homo.

13:48.494 --> 13:51.111
As we Finns say, the morning
is wiser than the evening.

13:51.247 --> 13:52.641
Are you feeling wiser
this morning, Selina?

13:52.665 --> 13:55.783
- Get off.
- No? I see that we are still choosing

13:55.877 --> 13:57.743
not to make the best of the situation.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.248
I can't.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.171
Who ate my yogurt?

14:03.301 --> 14:04.883
Alleged war criminal.

14:04.969 --> 14:07.409
Selina, I think it would be best
for everyone if you can learn

14:07.472 --> 14:09.885
to follow just a few simple
embassy staff rules.

14:09.974 --> 14:10.974
- What?
- Number one,

14:11.059 --> 14:14.097
you write your name
on your food in the refrigerator.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.395
- Oh, my God.
- You see here, I've written "Minna,"

14:16.481 --> 14:18.393
and I have written it
with a permanent marker.

14:18.983 --> 14:20.315
Number two,

14:20.401 --> 14:24.987
if you use a bowl or a spoon
or a plate or a cup or a jug,

14:25.114 --> 14:28.027
afterwards, you would
wash in the sink.

14:29.494 --> 14:30.494
Yeah?

14:33.456 --> 14:34.913
Selina, if you go to prison,

14:34.999 --> 14:36.991
you will not have your Gary
to clean up after you.

14:37.085 --> 14:38.354
- Okay, look...
- No, I'll be there.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.165
Ma'am, you gotta see
what's on TV. Come on.

14:40.254 --> 14:42.587
Maybe it's time for me
to just turn myself in, Ben.

14:42.673 --> 14:43.734
What is it? What's going on?

14:43.758 --> 14:45.569
<i>...Americans have come out in force
to show their support</i>

14:45.593 --> 14:47.112
<i>for the former,
and possibly future, president,</i>

14:47.136 --> 14:48.136
<i>Selina Meyer.</i>

14:48.262 --> 14:49.469
- Oh!
<i>- Footage rolls.</i>

14:49.639 --> 14:51.301
Free Selina now!

14:51.557 --> 14:52.557
What?

14:52.642 --> 14:54.759
It turns out Americans
don't give a flying fatwa

14:54.852 --> 14:56.434
if you drone a bunch of Muslims!

14:56.521 --> 14:58.082
Your favorables have
never been higher, ma'am.

14:58.106 --> 14:59.106
For polling purposes,

14:59.190 --> 15:00.852
you're practically
a generic white male.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.586
This is incredible!

15:02.610 --> 15:04.226
I feel like the Grim Reaper

15:04.320 --> 15:07.233
just dropped his scythe
and started eating me out!

15:07.615 --> 15:08.615
Mom.

15:08.699 --> 15:10.861
Ma'am, Catherine just had
the most romantic idea.

15:10.952 --> 15:12.989
- Oh, good.
- Getting married here in Europe.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.079
What?

15:15.915 --> 15:17.497
Oh, Catherine!

15:17.583 --> 15:19.916
What a wonderful idea.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.163
Thank you, Mother.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.254
- Gary.
- Yeah?

15:22.338 --> 15:25.046
Can you put something together
here, at the embassy?

15:25.299 --> 15:28.007
I found the perfect dress
at the Oslo Medieval Festival.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.756
- Oh, I doubt it.
- Good. Okay.

15:29.846 --> 15:31.323
Ma'am, we got bigger reindeer
to fuck here.

15:31.347 --> 15:32.428
Guys, listen to me.

15:32.515 --> 15:34.552
A wedding got me into this hot mess,

15:34.976 --> 15:37.138
a wedding's gonna get me out of it.

15:37.353 --> 15:39.470
A Potemkin wedding,
if I may coin a phrase.

15:39.564 --> 15:40.564
Please don't.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.856
Okay. Look, we need a plane
to get us home, correct?

15:42.942 --> 15:45.776
<i>...Selina Meyer live via phone.
Hello, President Meyer.</i>

15:45.945 --> 15:46.945
Hi, Mike.

15:47.029 --> 15:50.272
You know, I just want
to thank the American people.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.025
I mean, obviously,
while it is regrettable,

15:53.119 --> 15:55.361
the loss of innocent lives,

15:55.496 --> 15:59.080
you know, I will never, ever apologize

15:59.208 --> 16:00.870
for keeping Americans safe.

16:01.252 --> 16:03.494
<i>Uh, Ma'am, we have
the drone footage here.</i>

16:03.588 --> 16:05.107
<i>Would you take our viewers through it?</i>

16:05.131 --> 16:07.339
<i>Guest speaks as footage two rolls.</i>

16:07.467 --> 16:11.302
Yes. Well, this is the compound
belonging to Hamza Al Bashir.

16:11.387 --> 16:13.507
<i>Now, hold on. What is that
right on over there, ma'am?</i>

16:13.598 --> 16:15.214
<i>Is that an elephant or something?</i>

16:15.516 --> 16:17.223
Yes. Yeah, I believe it is.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.018
Apparently, Al Bashir
had some sort of a private zoo,

16:20.104 --> 16:22.104
and that's actually how
we were able to locate him.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.355
<i>And boom!</i>

16:23.441 --> 16:24.932
<i>Wop! There goes the elephant.</i>

16:25.026 --> 16:26.358
- Ma'am?
- Yeah.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.769
I think I may have found us a plane.

16:29.030 --> 16:31.508
Governor, it's so nice of you
to come with us to comfort Jonah.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.532
Jonah Ryan has as much chance
of becoming president

16:33.659 --> 16:35.992
as a stack of retarded raccoons
in a trench coat,

16:36.078 --> 16:38.616
but if anyone's crawling out
of our cesspool of a state

16:38.706 --> 16:40.914
to become his Ag Sec,
it's gonna be this pigfucker.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.853
Yeah. I didn't realize
that was a job requirement.

16:47.048 --> 16:48.584
Oh, my God.

16:48.966 --> 16:51.959
What do you think?
Beige or Tuscan beige?

16:52.053 --> 16:53.385
Tough call.

16:53.471 --> 16:55.758
They are the same.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.965
And how is the blushing bride?

16:58.059 --> 17:00.016
Mother, come on. Really?

17:00.228 --> 17:02.720
- Cath, this is the best I could do.
- Gorgeous.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.981
- You always do this.
- I do what?

17:06.651 --> 17:09.484
- Do you remember my 13th birthday?
- No, I certainly don't.

17:09.569 --> 17:11.048
Do you remember
my 16th birthday, then?

17:11.071 --> 17:12.257
- Do you remember that?
- No, darling.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.468
We gonna go through all the birthdays?
I don't remember any of them.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.762
Do you remember my high school
graduation, or my college graduation?

17:16.786 --> 17:18.055
Or any time I brought home a boyfriend

17:18.079 --> 17:19.388
for you to meet
before I had girlfriends?

17:19.413 --> 17:21.517
I didn't know the theme of the wedding
was Edward Scissor Sisters.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.726
- I mean, seriously.
- I'm gonna pause.

17:22.750 --> 17:25.083
Those sandwiches aren't
gonna finger themselves.

17:25.169 --> 17:27.080
- I'll be right back.
- Catherine, I do not

17:27.171 --> 17:30.005
want to fight with you, my darling.

17:30.091 --> 17:32.458
- I...
- No, honey, listen to me.

17:32.843 --> 17:37.087
I am so very proud of you

17:37.348 --> 17:41.638
and your decision to get married here.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.806
- Thank you, Mom.
- Mmm-hmm.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.639
And you look amazing.

17:47.942 --> 17:51.185
And I'm amazed by your look.

17:54.448 --> 17:56.405
Um, I'm just gonna freshen up.

17:56.492 --> 17:57.903
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.080
Okay, we're all good.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.126
- Where's your mother?
- She went to the bathroom.

18:08.004 --> 18:10.246
- That's not the bathroom.
- What?

18:11.215 --> 18:13.527
If I could just have
a moment of your time, Congressman.

18:13.551 --> 18:15.237
Will you move?
You're blocking the TV.

18:15.261 --> 18:17.469
Sorry. Yeah. I think
in a Ryan administration

18:17.555 --> 18:19.435
I could really make
a difference at agriculture.

18:19.473 --> 18:21.577
Yeah. Whatever. There isn't gonna
be a Department of Agriculture.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.433
- I'm getting rid of it.
- What?

18:23.519 --> 18:24.555
Richard, who is this guy?

18:24.645 --> 18:27.137
I'm the fucking governor
of Iowa, you nitwit!

18:27.231 --> 18:30.099
And you just cost yourself
a spot in my administration!

18:30.192 --> 18:32.775
- I'll call you a cab, Governor.
- Jonah, your dad's here!

18:32.862 --> 18:33.862
Oh, hey, Dad!

18:33.946 --> 18:35.653
Look who's ready for
a chicken pox party!

18:35.740 --> 18:38.027
- What, I gave my dad chicken pox?
- Second time!

18:38.117 --> 18:40.359
Now I can really see
the family resemblance.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.739
Two generations of scabs, yo!

18:41.829 --> 18:44.071
Fuck me with a side of ranch.

18:44.165 --> 18:45.605
See ya back at the office, Governor.

18:48.586 --> 18:50.186
Catherine. What has
your mother done now?

18:50.379 --> 18:54.373
She used our wedding as a diversion

18:54.467 --> 18:57.881
to escape from
the Norwegian National Police!

18:58.012 --> 18:59.012
Smart.

18:59.430 --> 19:00.470
Kitty Cat. It's all right.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.422
We'll just get married
back in the States.

19:02.516 --> 19:06.009
No. We are gonna
get married right now,

19:06.479 --> 19:09.313
in Europe, because it's romantic.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.223
Do you wanna maybe

19:11.317 --> 19:12.683
clean up first?

19:12.777 --> 19:15.815
No. I feel fucking pretty.

19:16.447 --> 19:17.563
Uh...

19:17.657 --> 19:20.616
I'm sorry. Who taught you
to do a smoky eye?

19:20.868 --> 19:24.111
Joint Special Operations
Command. JSOC.

19:24.747 --> 19:26.113
Ah.

19:26.207 --> 19:27.414
It's not bad.

19:27.792 --> 19:30.455
You know, these tunnels
date back to World War II.

19:30.544 --> 19:31.830
- Really?
- Brave local citizens

19:31.921 --> 19:34.004
banded together
in secret to assist the Nazis.

19:34.090 --> 19:37.128
I think we should be underneath
the security perimeter by now.

19:37.218 --> 19:39.380
- How can you tell?
- Ben. Over here.

19:39.470 --> 19:41.211
- What's that?
- Ben.

19:41.305 --> 19:42.421
Oh!

19:42.515 --> 19:43.515
Murman!

19:43.599 --> 19:44.599
Selina.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.078
I am so happy to see you!
You have no idea!

19:46.102 --> 19:48.219
- I have helped many tunnel escapes.
- Oh.

19:48.896 --> 19:50.353
- Funny story.
- Oh, here we go.

19:50.439 --> 19:54.399
Once, I told my enemy
it was tunnel escape,

19:54.485 --> 19:56.725
- but in fact, I just buried him alive.
- Uh-huh.

19:56.987 --> 19:58.228
Murman.

19:59.156 --> 20:01.443
Actually, it was her,

20:01.617 --> 20:04.030
but story is funnier with a man, huh?

20:04.120 --> 20:05.827
In these MeToo days, you know?

20:05.913 --> 20:08.246
Actually, I think
it could work with a woman.

20:08.332 --> 20:10.369
Either way, it's a very good story.

20:10.459 --> 20:12.451
Beginning, middle and end.
Plus a lesson.

20:12.545 --> 20:17.586
Oh, but I would never, ever buried
alive my dear old friend Selina.

20:17.675 --> 20:19.837
Oh. Chivalry is not dead, Murman.

20:19.927 --> 20:22.214
No, no, no. Her name was Svetlana,

20:22.304 --> 20:24.045
and she's definitely dead.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.348
Yeah, I think the story
does work better with a man.

20:26.559 --> 20:27.800
That was my first instinct.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.225
Well, there you go.

20:29.311 --> 20:31.052
Now, my car will take you
to the airport.

20:31.147 --> 20:32.763
- Okay.
- And the airplane is waiting

20:32.857 --> 20:36.066
to run out of gas
and drop you into the North Sea.

20:36.402 --> 20:37.402
What?

20:37.903 --> 20:39.314
Just kidding.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.736
- You are bad.
- You believed me!

20:44.076 --> 20:45.487
You got us.

20:46.120 --> 20:48.737
I want to make one quick stop
on the way to the airport.

20:48.873 --> 20:50.489
- What?
- Yeah, I wanna just pop in

20:50.583 --> 20:52.040
and grab my Nobel Peace Prize.

20:52.209 --> 20:54.952
Ma'am, that's the Nobel Prize
of bad ideas!

20:55.045 --> 20:56.857
- No, that's economics, okay?
- We need to be out

20:56.881 --> 20:58.543
of this jurisdiction immediately!

20:58.632 --> 21:00.419
Oh, please,
I've got America on my side,

21:00.509 --> 21:02.626
and America doesn't
give a shit about anything!

21:02.720 --> 21:03.864
The Hague gives a shit.

21:03.888 --> 21:05.991
Ma'am, we are not in America.
We just crawled out of a drain!

21:06.015 --> 21:07.993
- Wait, what?
- We're not in America right now.

21:08.017 --> 21:09.017
For crying out loud.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.717
Okay look, call Leon right now.

21:10.811 --> 21:13.144
Tell him to get his dick
out of whatever homeless woman

21:13.230 --> 21:14.541
froze to death in front of the hotel,

21:14.565 --> 21:16.325
meet us over there
with the speech. Let's go!

21:16.400 --> 21:17.400
Call him!

21:23.073 --> 21:24.968
Hi, I'm Dan Egan,
I used to work at the White House.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.699
You barely worked at the White House.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.743
Oh!

21:29.497 --> 21:31.580
Oh, Ames, I almost offered
to help your career,

21:31.665 --> 21:33.310
then bang you
and tell everybody in the office

21:33.334 --> 21:34.575
you're an unstable slut.

21:35.377 --> 21:36.458
It's a new dress.

21:40.633 --> 21:41.714
Come on, come on.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.463
Dumb child locks.

21:43.552 --> 21:45.794
- Need some help?
- Thank you so much.

21:47.890 --> 21:49.347
How long have you been taking these?

21:49.433 --> 21:51.766
Ever since Jonah whacked me
on the nose at the rally,

21:51.852 --> 21:53.718
but the pain went away in two days.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.679
They gave me 97 pills, though,

21:55.773 --> 21:59.107
so now I've just been taking them
for the going-away of my feelings.

21:59.276 --> 22:00.562
So you're not pregnant.

22:00.903 --> 22:03.020
Oh, no. Jonah and I
don't want any more kids

22:03.405 --> 22:05.647
until I can get my cake pop
business off the ground.

22:05.741 --> 22:08.053
And we can do genetic testing
to make sure they're not born dead.

22:09.453 --> 22:11.069
- Hey, Jonie.
- Yeah?

22:11.163 --> 22:14.201
You know, right now
you have a historic opportunity

22:14.291 --> 22:17.455
to speak to our better natures,
bring the country together.

22:17.545 --> 22:20.162
But to do that, I think
you have to tone down

22:20.256 --> 22:23.374
the angry, incoherent rhetoric a bit.

22:24.802 --> 22:26.293
I have kind of pushed it, haven't I?

22:26.387 --> 22:28.253
A little. A little bit, Jonie.

22:30.766 --> 22:32.302
Okay, Dad. Yeah, I will.

22:32.601 --> 22:34.684
Yeah. Okay.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.475
Hey, Mom, will you
make us some pancakes?

22:37.565 --> 22:39.445
- Ooh! Banana pancakes.
- Yeah, banana pancakes.

22:39.984 --> 22:42.067
Oh, you know, I don't think
I have any eggs.

22:42.152 --> 22:43.393
- Boo! Boo!
- Boo!

22:43.487 --> 22:45.900
Go to the store to make pancakes!

22:45.990 --> 22:49.199
- Pancakes! Pancakes!
- Jonah, I think that...

22:49.618 --> 22:51.109
Oh, my God! Lloyd!

22:51.495 --> 22:53.031
- Dad?
- Oh, my God! Call 911!

22:53.247 --> 22:55.113
- Dad!
- Make sure his nose is wet!

22:55.207 --> 22:57.039
- What?
- Uh, that's for dogs.

22:57.668 --> 22:59.000
Let's go. We gotta move.

22:59.086 --> 23:00.926
We gotta get this thing
and get to the airport.

23:01.338 --> 23:02.338
President Lu!

23:03.382 --> 23:05.044
You're a hard man to get ahold of.

23:07.803 --> 23:10.716
Are we really doing this again?
We all know he speaks English.

23:10.806 --> 23:12.966
I like your hair like that.

23:13.100 --> 23:14.887
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

23:15.436 --> 23:18.290
Selina Meyer. Why am I
not surprised to see you? Sit, please.

23:18.314 --> 23:22.058
Lookit, Lu, we have always
been able to do business together.

23:22.318 --> 23:25.186
If I'm elected,
the U.S. is gonna import

23:25.279 --> 23:28.147
a shit-ton more
of your tainted baby formula

23:28.240 --> 23:29.572
and defective drywall.

23:29.658 --> 23:31.194
- A little secret.
- What?

23:31.285 --> 23:32.947
Different label, same product.

23:33.037 --> 23:35.154
Islands.

23:35.247 --> 23:36.988
Any islands you want, Lu.

23:37.082 --> 23:40.450
Diaoyu, Spratly, Florida Keys, even.

23:41.170 --> 23:44.004
President Montez has been
a great friend to China.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.706
Our loyalty to her
is unshakable. I'm sorry.

23:48.010 --> 23:49.217
You can have Tibet.

23:50.220 --> 23:51.677
What?

23:51.764 --> 23:53.005
Yeah.

23:53.098 --> 23:54.464
You can have Tibet back.

23:54.975 --> 23:56.136
Are you fucking kidding me?

23:56.226 --> 23:58.764
No. Right after the election,
you can have it back.

23:58.854 --> 24:02.473
I mean, I'll have to condemn
your actions publicly, of course.

24:02.566 --> 24:03.566
Of course.

24:03.651 --> 24:05.938
But then we'll propose
a U.N. resolution,

24:06.028 --> 24:07.439
- you'll veto it...
- I will.

24:07.529 --> 24:09.486
Then, you know, have at it.

24:09.573 --> 24:11.533
Is being president in a democracy
even that great?

24:11.700 --> 24:14.408
- Well, it's barely a democracy, so...
- I agree with that.

24:14.495 --> 24:16.615
Listen, I got a thing to get.
Do we have a deal, or...

24:16.789 --> 24:18.371
- Sure.
- I knew it.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.289
- Yeah. We're good.
- You're a good man.

24:20.376 --> 24:22.083
I like it. You look good in a bow tie.

24:22.169 --> 24:23.229
Everything okay in here?

24:23.253 --> 24:24.369
Oh! You bet.

24:24.463 --> 24:25.749
'Cause you're my lapdog now.

24:25.839 --> 24:26.920
- Okay.
- Yeah.

24:27.549 --> 24:29.611
<i>I thought I would take
just a few moments of your time</i>

24:29.635 --> 24:34.130
<i>to remind you of the plight of
the Azerbaijani minority in Georgia...</i>

24:34.223 --> 24:35.259
I'm here!

24:36.642 --> 24:37.642
Thank you!

24:37.726 --> 24:39.092
I'm here! Thank you!

24:40.020 --> 24:41.852
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, thank you!

24:41.939 --> 24:43.976
It's very perilous for you to be here.

24:44.066 --> 24:45.682
Thank you so much! Thank you!

24:45.776 --> 24:47.438
- I don't think you should...
- Give it.

24:47.528 --> 24:50.817
Thank you so much
for that wonderful introduction.

24:51.115 --> 24:52.115
Thank you.

24:53.450 --> 24:55.658
When the committee called to tell me

24:55.744 --> 24:58.862
I would be receiving
the Nobel Peace Prize,

24:58.956 --> 25:00.822
Summit award...

25:01.208 --> 25:04.417
I considered telling them
I didn't want it.

25:04.837 --> 25:08.171
You see, it's never
been important to me

25:08.382 --> 25:10.169
to be honored publicly.

25:10.509 --> 25:13.377
But I decided to come tonight.

25:13.554 --> 25:16.718
Not for myself,
but for the country of...

25:18.976 --> 25:19.976
Tibet.

25:21.061 --> 25:26.102
Imagine a world
where Tibet were not free.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.100
Imagine that.

25:29.486 --> 25:32.229
And one of the world's
great human treasures,

25:32.698 --> 25:34.564
Tibet's Lamas,

25:34.908 --> 25:38.447
like these right here
sitting in the front row,

25:39.038 --> 25:40.745
looking at me...

25:42.624 --> 25:47.119
would certainly be
imprisoned and tortured

25:47.379 --> 25:51.089
in the most vicious ways imaginable,

25:52.509 --> 25:54.842
possibly even killed.

25:56.638 --> 25:58.971
Oh, God Almighty.

25:59.224 --> 26:02.058
So maybe I should just wrap this up.

26:02.144 --> 26:04.352
Shall we scroll ahead, please?

26:04.438 --> 26:05.519
Could you just... Yes.

26:05.606 --> 26:06.813
Wait. Yes.

26:07.483 --> 26:09.600
Tibet must always be free.

26:10.611 --> 26:13.069
Free today, free tomorrow,

26:13.530 --> 26:15.146
free forever. Oh, God.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.321
Uh, thank you.

26:16.408 --> 26:17.615
Wonderful!

26:17.701 --> 26:19.408
- Photos, please.
- Oh.

26:20.954 --> 26:21.990
Okay.

26:22.081 --> 26:23.697
No one's ever gonna
forget that speech.

26:24.124 --> 26:25.124
You're fired.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.078
All right, let's get out of here.

26:27.336 --> 26:28.747
Take this piece of shit.

26:28.921 --> 26:31.334
Stop. Selina, stop.
You give me no choice...

26:31.423 --> 26:32.755
Ugh. Goodbye, Minna.

26:32.841 --> 26:35.174
Wow. Talk about inhumane droning.

26:35.260 --> 26:36.501
I guess I've got a type.

26:37.429 --> 26:38.886
- Dan?
- Hi.

26:38.972 --> 26:40.179
So nice to see you

26:40.849 --> 26:42.681
on this sad occasion.

26:42.768 --> 26:45.476
So I thought maybe
we could get a drink and...

26:45.687 --> 26:47.895
Sorry. Ames,
this is Layla, my girlfriend.

26:49.316 --> 26:52.150
It just feels so weird saying that
out loud. I can't help it.

26:52.820 --> 26:54.339
- Hello.
- Hi.

26:54.363 --> 26:55.479
Layla's an ob-gyn.

26:56.198 --> 26:57.530
I know what she does.

26:57.616 --> 26:58.948
Oh, God, of course.

26:59.034 --> 27:00.616
You guys have already met.

27:00.702 --> 27:02.034
Classic Egan.

27:03.705 --> 27:04.912
Um, are you okay here?

27:05.165 --> 27:06.165
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah? OK.

27:07.543 --> 27:08.829
What's up, man?

27:09.211 --> 27:11.123
So, how was your
follow-up appointment?

27:11.213 --> 27:14.081
Less of a metal tube
up my vag than this.

27:14.299 --> 27:16.291
I'm so sorry, Nancy.

27:16.385 --> 27:19.253
Adult chicken pox can be very serious.

27:19.721 --> 27:20.949
Thank you for coming.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.509
Don't blame yourself, Jonah.

27:22.599 --> 27:23.806
It's not your fault.

27:26.228 --> 27:27.469
Oh, my God!

27:27.563 --> 27:29.683
Can you get her a pill
or something and calm her down?

27:29.898 --> 27:32.481
I don't want diazepam,
I want something good.

27:32.568 --> 27:33.568
Okay.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.234
Jonah, I gotta talk to you about that.

27:35.320 --> 27:38.028
- Okay. Oh, God.
- Jonie, Jonie.

27:38.115 --> 27:39.777
I'm just so sorry.

27:39.867 --> 27:42.985
Oh. Thank you, Uncle Jeff.
I really appreciate that.

27:43.078 --> 27:45.518
Sorry you killed your own father
and I wasn't there to see it!

27:51.086 --> 27:52.918
- Sorry!
- Uncle Jeff.

27:53.338 --> 27:55.150
Could you please stop laughing?

27:55.174 --> 27:56.506
I can't!

27:57.384 --> 27:59.125
I can't believe
you gave him chicken pox.

27:59.219 --> 28:01.085
I always had you pegged
as an AIDS guy.

28:07.186 --> 28:10.395
It's not funny,
but his laughter is infectious.

28:10.480 --> 28:11.480
I can't breathe!

28:14.943 --> 28:16.900
- I can't breathe!
- Mr. Kane,

28:16.987 --> 28:18.979
you're gonna come with me.

28:19.198 --> 28:22.282
Here's my hotel key.
If you got a dick, I'll pay double.

28:22.367 --> 28:24.734
Okay, everybody can come in
and take a seat.

28:25.078 --> 28:26.489
- Hey, babe.
- I love you.

28:26.580 --> 28:27.946
Love you too.

28:28.332 --> 28:31.075
So first off, I guess,
thanks, everybody, for coming.

28:31.627 --> 28:32.834
And, um,

28:33.587 --> 28:36.250
as most of you know,
I didn't get a lot of time with my dad

28:36.340 --> 28:38.878
but I think in the time
that I did have with him

28:39.092 --> 28:41.505
I realized what a stupid loser he was.

28:41.595 --> 28:44.303
He didn't deserve me. Or even my mom.

28:44.598 --> 28:46.885
All he ever did, actually,
was run out on us.

28:46.975 --> 28:50.184
You know, first, all those years ago,
and now by dying.

28:50.270 --> 28:51.681
Oh. Whoa!

28:51.772 --> 28:54.083
And I guess I don't even really
know if I liked him that much,

28:54.107 --> 28:56.827
because he probably would have sucked
like all of my other step-dads.

28:57.402 --> 29:00.270
And I don't care that he's dead,
because I am very strong.

29:00.364 --> 29:01.696
You're so beautiful.

29:01.782 --> 29:03.218
We're having cake pops
at the house later.

29:03.242 --> 29:04.574
Who wants to go dancing?

29:04.660 --> 29:07.180
- I'm leaving. This place sucks.
- My husband's right there.

29:07.204 --> 29:09.537
Richard, that bastard Ballentine,

29:10.123 --> 29:12.331
he caught shingles from Typhoid Jonah.

29:12.584 --> 29:15.418
He went blind with partial paralysis
and has to step down.

29:15.504 --> 29:16.745
Oh, my God, that's awful.

29:16.838 --> 29:18.830
No! That makes me, I mean you,

29:19.299 --> 29:20.915
the Governor of Iowa!

29:21.176 --> 29:23.259
- Congratulations to us both.
- Oh, my God.

29:23.637 --> 29:26.596
So listen, you guys, we have to
start thinking about the convention.

29:26.682 --> 29:28.534
- Oh, yeah. Sure do.
- And possible veep candidates.

29:28.558 --> 29:30.424
There are a lot of people
I want to snub.

29:30.519 --> 29:31.519
- Ma'am.
- Yeah?

29:31.603 --> 29:32.603
Check this out.

29:32.688 --> 29:35.180
Oh, my God! Is that Richard?

29:35.274 --> 29:36.310
Governor Splett.

29:36.400 --> 29:37.400
- No!
- Yeah.

29:37.484 --> 29:39.337
What the hell?

29:39.361 --> 29:40.477
What's going on here?

29:40.570 --> 29:43.563
I thought nobody gave
two Osama bin Shits

29:43.657 --> 29:44.943
about the drone strike.

29:45.033 --> 29:46.899
This is about killing elephants.

29:47.077 --> 29:49.514
Yeah. There's two things Americans
don't like to see get hurt,

29:49.538 --> 29:51.780
animals, and white girls
on spring break.

29:51.873 --> 29:52.934
The story is everywhere.

29:52.958 --> 29:54.244
Peggy Noonan has a column

29:54.334 --> 29:56.542
about Babar and
American exceptionalism.

29:56.628 --> 29:57.744
Oh, she's a dumb cunt.

29:58.171 --> 30:00.083
Is this gonna affect
my numbers, you think?

30:00.299 --> 30:01.299
Yes.

30:04.094 --> 30:05.301
Oh, my God!

30:06.763 --> 30:07.924
He's giving me the finger.

30:08.307 --> 30:09.673
Look. See?

30:11.643 --> 30:14.977
As many of you know,
it has been a difficult week for me,

30:15.939 --> 30:19.649
with the death of my dumb father
and my hot wife going into rehab.

30:20.068 --> 30:23.778
Which, when you think about it,
kind of makes her hotter, you know?

30:24.573 --> 30:27.156
But with the Lord's help,
I got through it.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.284
And when I say Lord,

30:30.370 --> 30:33.158
I mean Jesus Christ Almighty,
not the Jewish one.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.375
Now, there has been a lot of debate

30:38.628 --> 30:42.212
about whether vaccines
do or do not kill people.

30:42.299 --> 30:44.416
And they do, that's just science.

30:44.634 --> 30:48.503
But the other real killer is diseases.

30:48.805 --> 30:51.923
And how do these diseases
get into America?

30:52.059 --> 30:53.550
- How?
- Immigrants.

30:53.769 --> 30:54.976
- Kill them!
- Yeah.

30:55.103 --> 30:57.220
Well, I mean, we don't
have to kill all of them.

30:57.314 --> 30:59.431
There are some
good immigrants. Beyoncé?

30:59.649 --> 31:01.766
Ms. Brookheimer,
do you have anything to eat?

31:01.860 --> 31:04.898
Um, I've got gum and Advil.

31:06.031 --> 31:08.990
He had this carne asada
that I think was a family recipe.

31:09.076 --> 31:10.112
That guy stays.

31:10.327 --> 31:13.320
But we are not going to stop diseases

31:14.164 --> 31:16.781
unless we close our borders!

31:16.875 --> 31:19.117
- Yeah!
- From now on,

31:19.419 --> 31:21.877
no one in, no one out!

31:22.589 --> 31:25.502
Thank you. No one in, no one out!

31:27.427 --> 31:30.261
- What? Who's there?
- Uh, it's Richard.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.046
- Who?
- Oh, governor Richard Splett?

31:32.140 --> 31:35.804
- Oh.
- We, uh, brought you some flowers.

31:36.228 --> 31:37.764
Word is out on you, Splett.

31:37.938 --> 31:39.520
You're living proof

31:39.606 --> 31:42.519
that the worst people
in politics always succeed.

31:42.609 --> 31:45.898
I'll tell you something else, Splett.
Listen carefully.

31:45.987 --> 31:48.229
Someday you'll be
an old man, and you'll...

31:48.323 --> 31:49.323
Governor Splett...

31:49.408 --> 31:52.169
Now that you're a super-delegate,
have you given any thought as to who

31:52.244 --> 31:53.846
you're gonna be
endorsing at the convention?

31:53.870 --> 31:55.736
Isn't there any way
I can endorse all of them?

31:56.998 --> 31:58.955
Okay. All right,
thank you guys so much.

32:02.212 --> 32:03.498
Pull up a chair, Splett.

32:03.922 --> 32:06.005
I've never told anyone this before.

32:07.300 --> 32:10.338
I have a daughter in California.

32:10.679 --> 32:13.012
She doesn't know anything about me.

32:13.348 --> 32:15.931
I've seen photographs on the internet.
