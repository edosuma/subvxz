07:11.631 --> 07:14.395
three crucial truths about Clooney.

First, though he has never fallen in love,
he believes in love at first sight.

- to speaking Italian.
- Ciao, bella.

07:54.307 --> 07:58.038
The final key to Clooney
is resisting his charm.

07:58.144 --> 08:01.307
Men and women alike
find it irresistible...

08:01.414 --> 08:04.872
