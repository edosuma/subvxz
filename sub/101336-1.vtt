00:17.449 --> 00:21.554
I was dead.
That's what the doctor told me.

00:23.755 --> 00:25.792
Legally dead he called it.

00:28.394 --> 00:33.298
I don't know what
illegally dead is, but legally?

00:34.233 --> 00:38.138
I was dead as a duck,
down in Arnaudville.

00:40.838 --> 00:45.777
So when I woke up, I was
soaking wet from head to toe.

00:47.413 --> 00:51.551
And there he was,
standing over me.

00:53.618 --> 00:55.354
Praying.

00:57.623 --> 01:02.362
That man, he brought me
back to life.

01:06.265 --> 01:09.769
And that, I know ma'am.

01:10.702 --> 01:13.539
He brought me right here,
back to life.

02:08.526 --> 02:09.696
Shit.

02:19.738 --> 02:21.274
You getting out or what?

02:22.875 --> 02:26.446
Hey, you think you could uhm,
make the block a few times?

02:26.912 --> 02:28.715
Till some more people show?

02:30.049 --> 02:31.384
Don't think it's startin' yet.

02:34.485 --> 02:35.587
Whatever.

02:47.699 --> 02:50.470
Fine, just stick around
a few minutes all right?

02:53.672 --> 02:56.508
- Huh?
- Whatever.

03:05.383 --> 03:06.386
Hey!

03:48.126 --> 03:52.798
- Seriously.
- I love you guys, you don't have to thank me...

03:53.799 --> 03:56.102
- What?
- What is she doing here?

03:56.134 --> 04:00.438
- Gal?
- Hey, look, I know I'm early...

04:00.472 --> 04:01.841
You're late.

04:02.608 --> 04:05.444
- It says two.
- What day is it?

04:06.512 --> 04:08.413
- It's Saturday.
- Sunday.

04:08.447 --> 04:10.449
- No it's Saturday, I...
- We had his party yesterday,

04:10.482 --> 04:11.484
Saturday.

04:17.488 --> 04:20.892
Is he here? Did he...

04:22.594 --> 04:26.432
- Are you high?
- You should take down those balloons...

04:26.465 --> 04:28.967
Did you seriously show up to
our son's birthday party high?

04:29.001 --> 04:30.902
No, there's no party remember?

04:30.936 --> 04:35.174
Despite all the balloons
outside, is he here, I...

04:35.207 --> 04:38.745
- I have something for him.
- I don't think it's a good idea.

04:40.511 --> 04:41.780
Shi...

04:57.196 --> 04:59.465
Gal, look at me.

04:59.498 --> 05:02.134
I'm just gonna give him
this present and go, alright?

05:02.167 --> 05:05.638
Gal? What's going on?

05:05.671 --> 05:07.073
Found it.

05:09.174 --> 05:11.977
We haven't seen you in
months and now all of the sudden...

05:14.679 --> 05:18.184
You know you're short
last month? 80 bucks.

05:19.518 --> 05:24.857
- I ain't trying to get Social Services back over here.
- Here is, 14, you happy?

05:24.890 --> 05:26.825
What are we supposed
to buy with that?

05:26.859 --> 05:28.193
Just hang on,

05:28.227 --> 05:30.797
just, I'm sorry, just hang on.

05:36.234 --> 05:37.970
Is that 80 bucks worth?

05:45.210 --> 05:47.712
No, no, no, no.

05:54.886 --> 05:56.188
Please.

06:01.626 --> 06:04.597
Okay, okay. Just,

06:05.963 --> 06:08.700
stay here, I'll see
if I can settle him down okay?

06:19.143 --> 06:21.045
- It doesn't matter.
- Yes it does!

06:21.078 --> 06:23.681
- She's his mother.
- She doesn't act like a mother.

06:23.715 --> 06:26.952
- I'm more of a mother.
- I know but he needs to know her.

06:26.984 --> 06:29.922
Why? So he can be
heartbroken all over again?

06:29.955 --> 06:32.558
- Can't you relax for one second?
- No, I'm the one

06:32.590 --> 06:34.626
that deals with this shit
when she comes around.

06:34.660 --> 06:36.662
Stop freaking out.

06:45.136 --> 06:48.907
It's not about that!
She doesn't deserve to see him

06:48.941 --> 06:52.011
if she comes here a day after the birthday...

07:47.332 --> 07:50.036
Jesus Christ!

07:51.136 --> 07:53.873
- What?
- <i>Uh, Gal?</i>

07:55.107 --> 07:57.842
- Pop?
- <i>Yeah, this your Pop.</i>

07:59.410 --> 08:03.749
<i>Look, Gal, uhm, something
happened to your Maw.</i>

08:03.782 --> 08:07.686
<i>You need to come home.</i>

08:09.287 --> 08:11.624
<i>Don't make this about you, Gal.</i>

08:12.256 --> 08:13.792
<i>Something happened
to your Maw,</i>

08:13.825 --> 08:15.995
<i>she needs you, come home.</i>

11:56.648 --> 11:59.051
Richard, don't know
how to thank you

11:59.084 --> 12:01.186
for bringing me
my precious little Gal.

12:02.354 --> 12:05.324
- How was the fishing today?
- Bad.

12:06.457 --> 12:08.326
Maybe I can make
something up for you

12:08.359 --> 12:10.863
to say thank you for,
you know, your troubles.

12:11.296 --> 12:13.364
- Something for that jock itch?
- It's okay,

12:13.398 --> 12:15.334
oh you got the yellow stuff?

12:18.369 --> 12:20.605
Yeah, I got the yellow stuff,
I'll be right back.

12:34.252 --> 12:37.122
Don't use too much of this huh,
half a table spoon

12:37.154 --> 12:38.456
twice a day,
with some hot water.

12:39.523 --> 12:41.092
I'ma just be
a couple of minutes,

12:41.125 --> 12:42.894
can you wait for me?

12:44.128 --> 12:45.431
He got a boat.

12:52.470 --> 12:53.873
Thought he
would never leave.

12:54.571 --> 12:56.541
Come on, come inside,
I'll make you something

12:56.574 --> 12:58.310
that'll make you feel better.

13:07.585 --> 13:10.455
You'll never guess
who come by here last night.

13:11.656 --> 13:13.626
The damned ol' Rougarou!

13:14.591 --> 13:15.593
You remember him?

13:17.228 --> 13:19.465
How he used to sneak up
through the cypress knees,

13:20.264 --> 13:22.234
hide there
until little girl's coming by,

13:23.468 --> 13:25.237
then he'd jump out
and he'd snatch her

13:25.269 --> 13:27.172
and he'd take her back
into the swamp!

13:28.473 --> 13:31.276
Yeah, that same Rougarou.

13:31.308 --> 13:33.511
He come right up
on the porch last night.

13:33.545 --> 13:35.479
That cheeky son of a bitch.

13:35.513 --> 13:38.383
He's up there looking to see
if we had any chickens.

13:40.317 --> 13:44.523
He kept going on and on
about prodigal daughters,

13:46.023 --> 13:48.326
and their kindly
good lookin' daddies.

13:57.768 --> 13:59.503
What is that?

13:59.537 --> 14:01.072
You don't trust your old Pop?

14:12.216 --> 14:13.484
Well?

14:15.253 --> 14:17.189
It's a little heavy
on the citronella, huh?

14:17.221 --> 14:18.389
Well, you need that.

14:19.490 --> 14:20.491
That's the secret.

14:22.127 --> 14:23.561
And that old Rougarou,

14:24.696 --> 14:27.231
that swamp monster,
that's the other secret, huh?

14:27.264 --> 14:29.200
Good thing
I got my Rougarou stick here.

14:33.370 --> 14:36.741
- Pop, you all right?
- Yeah, yeah, tip-top.

14:36.774 --> 14:38.309
You taking good care
of yourself?

14:40.110 --> 14:41.346
The best.

14:42.213 --> 14:44.249
Are you still taking
your pills and stuff?

14:46.216 --> 14:47.418
You still taking yours?

14:57.162 --> 15:00.532
What happened to Maw? Hmm?

15:10.642 --> 15:16.047
Gal... Your Maw...

15:20.317 --> 15:21.486
She went last night.

15:23.854 --> 15:26.024
Real quiet in her sleep,

15:27.392 --> 15:28.560
real peaceful.

15:42.806 --> 15:44.042
Well...

15:47.412 --> 15:49.348
She at peace finally, your Maw.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.420
That's the important thing.

15:55.586 --> 15:56.754
God bless her.

16:01.125 --> 16:02.760
Pop that's not how Maw died.

16:05.629 --> 16:07.499
Maw didn't die last night.

16:07.532 --> 16:09.868
And she sure as shit
didn't go peacefully.

16:09.901 --> 16:11.203
You hold on
just a second there.

16:11.235 --> 16:13.138
Maw died three years ago,

16:13.171 --> 16:14.540
I would know, I was there.

16:18.243 --> 16:19.645
You're wrong, she here.

16:22.846 --> 16:27.818
Pop. Pop, look...

16:47.172 --> 16:48.673
What the fuck, Pop?

16:51.542 --> 16:54.513
You, I, what...

16:54.546 --> 16:58.416
Okay, okay, oh, nah-ah-ah-ah.

16:58.449 --> 17:00.152
Fuck that!

17:23.974 --> 17:25.476
Pop, who is that?

17:26.877 --> 17:29.947
I gotta get a few more things
together and then we can get started.

17:29.981 --> 17:31.884
Get started with what?

17:34.484 --> 17:35.753
Moving the houseboat.

17:38.755 --> 17:40.824
Move? Moving it where?

17:40.858 --> 17:43.195
We're going to bury
your mother, Gal.

17:43.227 --> 17:46.164
That,
that's not my mother.

17:47.365 --> 17:48.433
It's what she wanted.

17:49.734 --> 17:51.669
To be buried
in the family plot.

17:54.472 --> 17:56.907
It's just a couple days journey
across the Basin.

17:56.940 --> 17:58.543
Pop, who is that?

18:00.278 --> 18:01.713
We gonna do what's right.

18:03.313 --> 18:05.716
She got a right, Gal, to have her family
there, and that means the both of us.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.819
I don't know what you got going
on there,

18:07.851 --> 18:09.687
but I'm, I ain't being
a part of it.

18:10.588 --> 18:11.590
Nope!

18:14.891 --> 18:16.894
Fine, I'll take you back
in the landing in the morning.

18:16.927 --> 18:18.463
No I, I ain't sleeping here.

18:19.429 --> 18:23.467
- I am not sleeping here.
- Yeah, well this boat is,

18:23.501 --> 18:26.504
and it goes to bed early,
so you'd better start swimming.

21:27.685 --> 21:28.720
Pop?

22:22.072 --> 22:24.609
Why do you look so alive?

22:50.901 --> 22:53.804
- Hello?
- Shit...

22:59.843 --> 23:03.581
Oh, my God, look who it is!

23:04.715 --> 23:06.016
Goodness gracious, Gal!

23:07.284 --> 23:10.021
God, is that really you?

23:10.053 --> 23:15.659
Hey, uh, Warden. Is it now?

23:15.693 --> 23:18.062
Oh, yeah,
agent of the law I guess.

23:20.031 --> 23:22.066
How things change, am I right?

23:22.099 --> 23:24.002
- Yeah.
- Old man around?

23:26.203 --> 23:28.705
- No he's actually...
- McGees,

23:28.738 --> 23:30.707
- McGees Landing.
- What?

23:30.741 --> 23:32.609
That's it.
Last time I saw you,

23:32.642 --> 23:34.878
you were in the back of my truck
at McGees Landing

23:34.911 --> 23:36.648
with my little brother T-boy.

23:37.648 --> 23:39.817
He's still around,
you ought to give him a call.

23:39.850 --> 23:41.686
Yeah, I don't know, maybe.

23:41.718 --> 23:45.756
I mean you're not,
one of them, you know...

23:49.726 --> 23:52.830
I heard you got locked up
a little while.

23:52.862 --> 23:54.131
I know how it goes in there.

23:54.898 --> 23:56.001
But you're not...

23:58.168 --> 24:01.038
I mean, T-boy's a great guy if
that's what you're looking for.

24:01.071 --> 24:02.940
You said you needed
something from my dad?

24:05.309 --> 24:11.049
Right. Yeah, I just wanted
to touch base with...

24:13.016 --> 24:14.852
Can I come in?

24:21.958 --> 24:24.128
I know he ain't been doing
too good lately.

24:25.295 --> 24:28.365
So I figure I'd stop by,
you know.

24:28.398 --> 24:32.736
Yeah, nah, I'll appreciate it,
he's gonna be a while though,

24:32.770 --> 24:34.973
he's probably at church
or something, you know him.

24:35.805 --> 24:38.943
Oh, yeah, we all know him.

24:41.012 --> 24:42.647
How's he look, he doing okay?

24:43.280 --> 24:45.783
Yeah, yeah,
he's fine, he's, why?

24:46.917 --> 24:50.120
Oh, you know,
you hear things.

24:52.356 --> 24:56.161
I... Well, I mean,
what kind of things?

24:57.927 --> 25:02.333
Look. I consider myself
a good Catholic boy.

25:04.201 --> 25:09.107
I just can't buy
into false prophets and such.

25:10.206 --> 25:13.911
That fella 20 years ago they say
he resurrected, I just can't.

25:15.012 --> 25:19.017
And I suppose,
after what he did to your Maw

25:19.050 --> 25:22.721
- a few years back.
- Well, he didn't do anything to my mom.

25:23.721 --> 25:25.223
Well, we both know
that ain't true.

25:28.259 --> 25:31.029
The only miracle is he didn't go
to prison for drowning her.

25:33.363 --> 25:36.000
I'm sorry I'm a jackass I didn't
mean to bring all that up.

25:37.901 --> 25:41.138
Look, I just wanna ask him
a few questions.

25:41.171 --> 25:42.640
About what?

25:43.474 --> 25:46.744
He mentioned anything
or anybody I don't know,

25:47.844 --> 25:50.314
- out of the ordinary around here?
- How?

25:51.849 --> 25:53.018
A young guy for one.

25:53.783 --> 25:55.352
Guy, no.
He hasn't seen any guys.

25:55.386 --> 25:56.854
So a girl then?

25:56.887 --> 25:59.691
No, he hasn't seen any... no.

26:01.324 --> 26:02.660
He told you that?

26:04.028 --> 26:08.199
- Wh... What?
- He told you he hasn't seen anybody?

26:09.332 --> 26:11.168
Well...

26:13.137 --> 26:16.307
I mean, it's fine, it's fine.

26:17.742 --> 26:21.046
Just seems like a weird point
of conversation.

26:21.846 --> 26:23.748
Hey, Gal, I'm out of sugar,

26:23.781 --> 26:25.750
the faucet's leaky
and I ain't seen nobody,

26:25.782 --> 26:27.017
how you doing?

26:30.053 --> 26:32.724
I guess it is, yeah.

26:36.526 --> 26:37.861
Anyway.

26:39.530 --> 26:42.834
Following up a report on a woman
who jumped off a bridge,

26:42.867 --> 26:44.402
some good ol' boy called it in.

26:45.202 --> 26:46.404
No ID.

26:48.071 --> 26:49.840
But it looks like
she caught a flat,

26:49.873 --> 26:51.842
decided to change it,

26:51.876 --> 26:53.344
and had a change of heart.

26:54.878 --> 26:56.814
Decided
to take a swan dive.

27:00.251 --> 27:03.253
No, no. Stop.

27:03.286 --> 27:06.423
- It's okay, it's okay.
- No.

27:06.456 --> 27:08.292
- I'm just here to help.
- No!

27:12.495 --> 27:15.800
It's fine, it's fine.

27:15.832 --> 27:17.101
Stop...

27:20.204 --> 27:22.373
Your pa isn't coming back
for a while but,

27:23.907 --> 27:25.877
it'd be cool
if he comes back soon too.

27:27.077 --> 27:30.181
You know,
I'm just here to help.

27:31.447 --> 27:33.984
Seeing how we go back
a while and all.

27:34.017 --> 27:36.086
What'd they do
to you in there, hon?

27:46.964 --> 27:50.400
Ah, hey there, Warden, I thought
I recognized your boat.

27:50.434 --> 27:53.937
Uh, yeah, it's me.

27:55.572 --> 27:57.507
Oh, sorry about the noise,

27:57.541 --> 28:00.344
but as I was pulling
up there was a,

28:00.377 --> 28:02.446
a big old woodie buzzing around.

28:03.480 --> 28:05.483
Didn't want him thinking that
he could just come around here

28:05.515 --> 28:07.819
anytime he wanted
and started pecking.

28:08.519 --> 28:10.321
So I fired off a warning shot.

28:12.089 --> 28:14.425
Nowhere near him, but maybe
next time I shoot him.

28:19.863 --> 28:23.333
Right. Well, uh...

28:24.635 --> 28:28.205
- I guess I ought to be going.
- You wanna stay for a snack?

28:29.173 --> 28:31.442
My Gal know how to carve up
a sausage real good.

28:35.279 --> 28:39.184
Thanks, I gotta uh,
I gotta hit it.

29:20.690 --> 29:23.460
Looks like
your boat's awake now.

29:23.494 --> 29:25.230
I'm ready to go back.

30:01.665 --> 30:04.936
So maybe I was thinking
you could

30:04.968 --> 30:07.504
stay a little bit, maybe,
you know, for lunch.

30:07.538 --> 30:09.173
No, I gotta go.

30:10.674 --> 30:13.011
So anyways I was uhm,

30:14.078 --> 30:16.080
I was hoping maybe
you would let me you know,

30:17.447 --> 30:19.282
maybe help you out a little bit,

30:19.315 --> 30:21.119
with my little grandson.

30:23.186 --> 30:27.090
I mean, uh,
it's not much money, but uhm...

30:36.466 --> 30:41.973
Uh... Uh, I probably
put it in the cookie jar.

30:54.451 --> 30:56.321
That son of a bitch Warden.

30:58.155 --> 31:00.023
I knew that bastard
was over here for no good.

31:00.057 --> 31:04.395
- Pop. Pop!
- What?

31:08.197 --> 31:09.233
Here.

31:20.310 --> 31:22.280
Keep it, I was gonna give it
to you anyway.

31:24.447 --> 31:26.117
Come on,
I'll take you back now.

31:35.725 --> 31:39.696
Pop, Pop!

31:39.730 --> 31:42.767
Pop, Percy got bit by a snake!

31:43.634 --> 31:46.003
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
go, go, go, go, go, go!

32:12.596 --> 32:16.400
Please grab my bag. Grab my bag!

32:16.433 --> 32:18.069
Alright...

32:31.747 --> 32:34.217
Hey, Pop.

32:38.821 --> 32:40.358
Was a cottonmouth.

32:46.129 --> 32:47.630
Walked up right on him.

32:47.664 --> 32:49.267
I see.

33:15.324 --> 33:18.495
Peepaw okay, alright baby?

33:20.664 --> 33:24.569
Peepaw gonna be okay, baby...

33:31.507 --> 33:32.876
Oh, baby...

33:36.346 --> 33:40.618
Calm down, calm down.

33:42.386 --> 33:44.855
Shh, shh, shh,

33:44.888 --> 33:47.524
stay there, baby,
you stay there.

33:51.561 --> 33:53.563
Percy, oh baby.

34:28.764 --> 34:32.703
Pop! Let go off her!

34:34.804 --> 34:36.239
Stop!

34:47.951 --> 34:53.324
Ssshht, ssshht, ssshht!

34:53.857 --> 34:57.661
Pop! Don't,
he needs a doctor, Pop!

35:09.005 --> 35:11.774
- <i>Merci.</i>
- You're okay.

35:11.808 --> 35:16.347
<i>Merci.</i> I'm okay, I'm okay...

35:21.485 --> 35:22.620
Hey.

35:29.826 --> 35:30.895
You okay?

35:33.462 --> 35:37.567
You're learning
from the best, cher. To heal.

35:39.435 --> 35:42.672
You have it in you too,
I can see it.

35:43.739 --> 35:48.378
- No, I'm just his daughter.
- Well, that's your luck,

35:48.411 --> 35:51.781
that's what they say right?
Gets passed down the family,

35:51.815 --> 35:54.485
woman to man, man to woman.

35:59.822 --> 36:00.824
For you.

36:02.558 --> 36:04.761
It's a hundred-year-old cypress.

36:05.862 --> 36:07.764
It too is a gift.

36:09.632 --> 36:12.969
Watch your step.
Hey get your jacket on it's cold outside.

36:14.103 --> 36:17.774
- <i>Merci beaucoup.</i>
- Bae, you're not supposed to say thank you.

36:18.808 --> 36:20.543
There she go the boss.

36:24.514 --> 36:28.452
Okay. I need to go.

36:50.940 --> 36:52.542
<i>Can I fix you something?</i>

36:53.143 --> 36:56.580
No, I just, I lay down a minute
I'll be good-good.

38:31.174 --> 38:34.445
Ah, no, no, no,
cut it, cut it!

38:34.478 --> 38:37.648
Gal, cut it, cut it,
you're gonna burn the motor.

38:38.915 --> 38:43.020
Hey, cut it! Cut it,
you're gonna burn it up!

38:43.052 --> 38:46.723
- I got the what?
- Cut it, cut it! You're gonna burn it up!

38:51.661 --> 38:53.097
Sorry...

38:59.569 --> 39:00.971
Okay, give it a shot.

39:01.003 --> 39:02.605
No, I've done enough I think.

39:03.639 --> 39:04.741
You all right?

39:06.141 --> 39:07.444
Tip-top.

39:10.746 --> 39:11.748
Alright.

39:13.650 --> 39:14.652
Allons.

39:21.757 --> 39:22.759
Right there.

39:29.065 --> 39:31.836
Now you twist that son-of-a-gun
till she's tight-tight.

39:40.643 --> 39:41.712
Yeah, that's good.

39:46.049 --> 39:48.552
Watch your hands,
I got the trim.

40:04.067 --> 40:07.603
Maybe we can borrow
Richard's flat-bottom,

40:07.636 --> 40:10.640
- we can figure out how to get him back out here.
- No, Pop.

40:10.674 --> 40:13.576
You don't just go trawling around
the basin with a dead body.

40:16.279 --> 40:19.116
Okay then,
you're the boss I guess.

40:19.148 --> 40:20.717
Time to get back to work.

40:21.750 --> 40:24.187
But if it's not the spark plug
then I don't...

40:28.725 --> 40:29.927
You've been going to church?

40:36.299 --> 40:37.768
It's been a minute.

40:41.304 --> 40:42.306
Any reason?

40:43.739 --> 40:44.741
Nah, not really.

40:49.212 --> 40:50.246
Reach in the toolbox.

40:51.147 --> 40:52.583
Yeah, what you need?

40:53.382 --> 40:56.085
You remember
what a Phillips head look like?

40:56.118 --> 40:59.022
That's the one that got
a little cross on the tip.

41:06.830 --> 41:07.898
So what happened?

41:10.000 --> 41:11.001
What?

41:12.969 --> 41:15.005
You just woke up
one morning and,

41:17.272 --> 41:18.608
you don't believe?

41:20.275 --> 41:22.212
You can believe
without going to church.

41:25.081 --> 41:26.016
So you do?

41:27.851 --> 41:30.988
You know, Pop,
not believing or not knowing,

41:31.020 --> 41:34.057
it's not a bad thing,
it's fine.

41:35.357 --> 41:37.293
Well, it's a sad thing,
don't you think?

41:39.128 --> 41:41.764
- Well, here you are.
- And what's that mean?

41:43.667 --> 41:46.302
I mean, no offense, Pop,
but, belief has got you exactly

41:46.335 --> 41:49.973
this far, you know, you stuck out
hiding in the middle of nowhere.

41:51.674 --> 41:53.643
And a lotta good
it did Maw.

41:56.712 --> 41:58.715
What made you believe
you could...

42:02.085 --> 42:05.155
Alright don't bullshit me,
what happened yesterday?

42:05.188 --> 42:07.023
That man
with the snakebite?

42:09.359 --> 42:11.027
What you think happened?

42:12.828 --> 42:15.298
But it doesn't work
every time, right?

42:20.069 --> 42:21.071
Allons.

42:22.938 --> 42:24.774
Come on, you take over.

42:27.844 --> 42:30.112
- Pull the spark plug.
- Pop, we did that.

42:30.145 --> 42:33.650
Just pull the spark plug.
Take the cap off of it, number one.

42:36.853 --> 42:37.921
And twist it.

42:45.161 --> 42:46.296
Okay, give it here.

42:49.165 --> 42:52.369
Oh, well, there it is
right there, ah.

42:54.337 --> 42:56.773
Yeah, just needs a little love.

43:00.310 --> 43:02.946
Come on, you too.

43:04.114 --> 43:06.050
Go on.

43:08.518 --> 43:10.286
Well, you got to put it back in.

43:12.422 --> 43:13.424
Tight-tight.

43:16.259 --> 43:17.427
Put the cap back on.

43:18.494 --> 43:20.897
Pop, I mean,
we did all this already.

43:26.168 --> 43:27.904
Go ahead.

43:42.051 --> 43:43.286
What'd you do?

43:44.987 --> 43:46.355
You got to have a little faith.

43:49.424 --> 43:52.361
So that's where God's been all this
time, fixing boat motors?

43:53.096 --> 43:56.366
Well, it never hurts to offer up
a Hail Mary.

43:59.101 --> 44:02.371
Allons, we got to start moving
the houseboat.

44:04.907 --> 44:05.942
Alright.

46:36.592 --> 46:37.628
How much longer?

46:40.563 --> 46:43.500
If we leave by sun up,
we should be there by afternoon.

46:47.270 --> 46:49.038
You know
you don't have to stay here.

46:49.973 --> 46:51.675
You can go back home.

46:51.708 --> 46:53.377
This is my home, Gal.

46:54.643 --> 46:57.147
Besides I get better
reception out here

46:57.179 --> 46:59.248
in case the big guy
need to give me a call.

47:08.391 --> 47:09.659
I don't feel right about it.

47:15.431 --> 47:17.567
You keep that and maybe

47:17.600 --> 47:19.502
use it with that little fella
of yours.

47:19.534 --> 47:21.038
I don't need your money.

47:22.772 --> 47:24.975
What I'm gonna do
with it out here?

47:25.007 --> 47:27.410
Well, maybe you could use it
if you decided to go back.

47:29.244 --> 47:32.181
Just take it, come on.

47:37.219 --> 47:39.121
I don't see him
too much anyway.

47:43.259 --> 47:46.096
He's got a new mama now,
and one's plenty.

47:50.400 --> 47:53.603
- Now, Gal, you ask me...
- No, I didn't, I didn't.

47:58.808 --> 48:02.112
But it seem to me that you need
to be in that little boy's life.

48:03.346 --> 48:05.614
A mother's place
is beside her child.

48:07.616 --> 48:09.385
I think
maybe that little boy

48:09.418 --> 48:11.388
might be able to bring you
some happiness.

48:12.755 --> 48:14.624
Maybe if you could find
a little happiness,

48:14.656 --> 48:16.092
you wouldn't need that junk.

48:18.360 --> 48:19.395
Hold on.

48:25.234 --> 48:27.304
I don't want you ending up
like me.

48:29.371 --> 48:34.277
You got no idea what's it like
for your child to drift away.

48:36.612 --> 48:38.648
That's exactly
what I'm trying to avoid.

48:40.183 --> 48:42.585
You're doing a lousy job because
you got nothing right now.

48:42.618 --> 48:44.654
Yeah, and nothing to lose.

48:46.456 --> 48:48.525
You know, most people
that got nothing to lose,

48:49.391 --> 48:52.661
they sack it up, they sack up
and they do better!

48:55.831 --> 48:58.801
It wasn't easy giving him up
like that you know.

48:58.835 --> 49:00.436
I know what you think.

49:01.471 --> 49:04.306
I could just quit, like I took
the easy way out.

49:05.107 --> 49:07.776
Well, it's not easy knowing
he's out there making friends

49:07.810 --> 49:11.114
and learning to ride a bike and,

49:11.147 --> 49:13.583
he's turning into somebody
I'm never gonna know.

49:18.221 --> 49:19.456
I can imagine it is...

49:19.489 --> 49:21.590
No, you can't, you can't!

49:22.757 --> 49:25.594
Because you kept me,
us, me and Maw,

49:25.627 --> 49:27.530
you held onto us
so fucking tight.

49:28.431 --> 49:30.333
You got to see it all
for yourself.

49:31.199 --> 49:32.802
And you know
what I got out of it?

49:33.869 --> 49:35.871
I got to see you passed out
on the bathroom floor

49:35.904 --> 49:37.306
on my fifth birthday.

49:39.141 --> 49:41.277
Yeah, I'm sure seven-year-old
dreams of

49:41.310 --> 49:42.846
watching
from the back seat

49:42.878 --> 49:45.114
as her father
gets arrested for a DUI.

49:45.647 --> 49:47.383
But people change.

49:48.851 --> 49:51.855
I don't know maybe you got Born Again
or something after you dried out.

49:51.888 --> 49:56.326
But it sure as shit doesn't mean you had
any business being a father back then.

50:12.674 --> 50:13.676
Pop?

50:15.444 --> 50:17.279
- Gal, I don't...
- No, Pop.

50:18.447 --> 50:19.583
Come see.

50:47.210 --> 50:48.411
He's dead...

50:59.554 --> 51:00.757
Should we put him inside?

51:01.891 --> 51:04.661
Well, I guess we can put him
in the same room with you.

51:06.895 --> 51:08.531
Alright just cover him.

51:16.438 --> 51:18.774
Maybe we can move him inside
after we bury your Maw.

51:21.277 --> 51:23.914
Allons, we gotta start
even earlier tomorrow.

54:35.069 --> 54:36.572
Mmm...

54:44.612 --> 54:46.014
I'm watching you.

55:45.540 --> 55:49.478
You sir,
have a spectacular collection of crap.

55:51.013 --> 55:54.049
And I really do mean that
in the nicest way possible.

56:04.058 --> 56:05.761
So what is all this stuff?

56:11.900 --> 56:12.902
Yeah, that one there uhm,

56:14.770 --> 56:17.474
that come from a one-eyed
chicken, name of Steve.

56:19.775 --> 56:22.612
The ugliest chicken
I ever seen but,

56:23.545 --> 56:24.848
she sure can...

56:28.183 --> 56:30.018
She sure can lay a perfect egg.

56:30.719 --> 56:33.556
Yeah.

56:33.589 --> 56:37.659
Help her owner out.
She had some sunstroke.

56:39.027 --> 56:40.562
You heal people?

56:41.063 --> 56:45.568
Oh, no, no, uhm,
God used me sometimes.

56:53.174 --> 56:55.677
So y'all,
y'all live around here?

56:56.277 --> 56:59.180
Yep, round about. You?

56:59.214 --> 57:02.819
Oh, nah.
I'm just passing through.

57:05.920 --> 57:06.989
Y'all headed somewhere?

57:09.190 --> 57:11.060
We're going bury my wife.

57:12.728 --> 57:15.732
Oh, I'm sorry.

57:16.331 --> 57:17.900
It was her time I think.

57:20.101 --> 57:24.574
She had a long hard road
the last couple of years.

57:26.074 --> 57:27.210
But she's at peace now.

57:30.145 --> 57:31.147
She's here?

57:32.114 --> 57:34.050
Yeah, she's in the back room.

57:34.083 --> 57:39.622
Pop, hey, uhm, can I talk
to you for a second?

57:39.654 --> 57:41.122
Yeah, I lost my wife too.

57:44.993 --> 57:45.994
I'm sorry.

57:47.061 --> 57:50.665
Oh, I was never there,

57:50.699 --> 57:53.802
was always on a rig,
14 on, 14 off, you know?

57:55.203 --> 57:57.672
And she's doing it all
by herself.

57:57.706 --> 58:00.009
Just taking care
of our baby.

58:02.277 --> 58:04.112
I tried to tell her
it wasn't her fault.

58:05.748 --> 58:08.952
I don't think that's something she
really wanted to hear, you know?

58:11.052 --> 58:14.123
Any... Yeah, anyway...

58:14.989 --> 58:18.159
uh, we catch a flat
on the bridge of all places,

58:18.192 --> 58:20.862
so I take to changing it,
and you know,

58:20.895 --> 58:22.331
and I look up and uh...

58:24.933 --> 58:27.070
she's standing on the edge.

58:29.304 --> 58:30.807
Then she stepped off.

58:35.911 --> 58:38.214
And I thought maybe,
maybe in that instant,

58:39.248 --> 58:42.619
she found the answer to why
she couldn't let go.

58:44.752 --> 58:46.722
To why she couldn't accept
that our baby...

58:48.156 --> 58:49.691
That our baby was gone.

58:52.326 --> 58:56.098
I thought that's, that sounds
like a good idea to me.

58:58.801 --> 59:00.168
So I followed after her.

59:04.772 --> 59:05.774
I miss her.

59:09.478 --> 59:13.081
You salvagers haven't found any other
bodies floating around here, have y'all?

59:18.119 --> 59:19.121
No.

59:24.125 --> 59:25.194
Come on, Gal...

59:26.494 --> 59:27.830
We need to start moving.

59:34.368 --> 59:35.370
Sorry.

59:42.009 --> 59:44.080
Hey. Can we talk?

59:46.147 --> 59:47.382
Can we talk?

59:50.185 --> 59:53.089
Looks like we doin' it.

59:56.090 --> 59:57.960
Right, so, what you think?

59:57.993 --> 01:00:00.163
- What do I think about what?
- His story.

01:00:04.933 --> 01:00:06.802
I just wonder what happened
to his wife.

01:00:08.469 --> 01:00:12.241
I'm wondering if you might've
seen her, his wife I mean.

01:00:13.875 --> 01:00:15.911
Well, I think I'd remember
that don't you?

01:00:17.946 --> 01:00:18.947
Right.

01:00:22.417 --> 01:00:25.420
We got a long trip today,
Gal, maybe you should just go

01:00:25.453 --> 01:00:27.322
make some coffee
while I handle this.

01:01:54.109 --> 01:01:55.177
How are you feeling?

01:01:56.311 --> 01:01:59.014
I was just about to ask
you the same question.

01:01:59.047 --> 01:02:00.850
Did you fall off a bridge too?

01:02:03.418 --> 01:02:05.021
Sorry 'bout your mom.

01:02:07.989 --> 01:02:10.225
I know you're probably just
trying to be strong for him,

01:02:10.259 --> 01:02:13.396
but deep down, it must be hard.

01:02:15.464 --> 01:02:19.168
Yeah. Yeah, it was hard...

01:02:20.134 --> 01:02:21.236
It is hard.

01:02:25.206 --> 01:02:27.442
Yeah, I know the feeling.

01:02:45.627 --> 01:02:47.362
Can you still walk?

01:02:55.971 --> 01:03:00.076
- No, yeah, I don't want...
- Come on. Just, please.

01:03:25.701 --> 01:03:32.641
Sarah? Sarah. Sarah. Sarah.
Wake up, baby. Sarah.

01:03:34.308 --> 01:03:37.345
What's wrong with her?
Sarah, wake up, honey.

01:03:37.378 --> 01:03:40.549
Sarah, wake up.
Sarah, wake, wake up, Sarah.

01:03:40.581 --> 01:03:43.051
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you sorry, why are you sorry,

01:03:43.085 --> 01:03:45.287
what's wrong with her?
What's wrong, Sarah?

01:03:45.319 --> 01:03:47.588
Sarah, wake up, Sarah, wake up!

01:03:47.621 --> 01:03:51.493
- Get away from...
- Sarah, wake up! Wake up, baby, please, wake up.

01:03:51.525 --> 01:03:55.263
- What the hell is he doing?
- Sarah.

01:03:55.297 --> 01:03:57.199
- Just let him...
- Stop it.

01:03:57.232 --> 01:03:59.668
- Pop, please don't.
- You stop it right now.

01:03:59.701 --> 01:04:01.503
- Hey!
- Pop, come on.

01:04:01.536 --> 01:04:03.405
- Hey!
- Please, get up!

01:04:03.438 --> 01:04:05.574
Hey get off of her!
Get over here, get up!

01:04:05.607 --> 01:04:09.011
- Pop! Come on he's hurt.
- No, he's a liar!

01:04:09.043 --> 01:04:12.313
- He's hurt.
- He's a liar! He gets off this boat now!

01:04:12.346 --> 01:04:13.748
You gotta stop it now!

01:04:13.781 --> 01:04:15.650
- He's a liar!
- Stop!

01:04:16.717 --> 01:04:20.121
I'm sorry it isn't Maw,
I'm so sorry, I wish it was Maw,

01:04:20.154 --> 01:04:24.459
but it's not, alright?
It's not her!

01:04:25.226 --> 01:04:27.562
You don't know,
you don't know, you don't know!

01:04:27.596 --> 01:04:30.299
You could help this man,
you could help him.

01:04:30.331 --> 01:04:33.268
That body's been in there for,
what, four or five days now?

01:04:34.036 --> 01:04:37.005
I know what this is.
You can do it.

01:04:37.038 --> 01:04:40.208
You could bring this woman back,
you did it before.

01:04:41.543 --> 01:04:43.212
This woman?

01:04:44.246 --> 01:04:46.581
Maw, it's Maw, you're right,

01:04:46.614 --> 01:04:49.351
it's Maw. And you can
bring her back, Pop.

01:04:50.252 --> 01:04:56.292
No, no I have, I have
to say goodbye, right?

01:04:57.092 --> 01:05:00.329
It's time I have
to say goodbye, I...

01:05:00.362 --> 01:05:03.065
I failed her last time I...

01:05:20.315 --> 01:05:22.150
Are you all right?

01:05:22.817 --> 01:05:25.787
Are you all right,
are you all right?

01:07:04.286 --> 01:07:06.388
Why does she look like that?

01:07:08.355 --> 01:07:10.191
Why does she look so alive?

01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:47.990
Uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm, I'm sorry.

01:08:48.022 --> 01:08:52.292
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:08:55.395 --> 01:08:56.598
Yeah, me too.

01:09:03.904 --> 01:09:05.541
Thank you.

01:09:07.408 --> 01:09:08.877
For keeping her safe.

01:09:10.377 --> 01:09:12.615
For letting me see her
one last time.

01:09:22.656 --> 01:09:23.993
I'd like your help.

01:10:28.923 --> 01:10:31.360
Pop, hey.

01:10:32.127 --> 01:10:36.097
Come on. What are you doing,
you're not gonna at least try?

01:10:39.433 --> 01:10:40.436
What?

01:10:48.176 --> 01:10:51.080
You were right, Gal,
it's not your Maw.

01:11:01.155 --> 01:11:04.525
Alright. Where is it?

01:11:05.627 --> 01:11:07.094
- Gal, Gal.
- Give it to me.

01:11:07.128 --> 01:11:08.929
- I'm gonna do it myself.
- Gal!

01:12:27.976 --> 01:12:29.478
Come on.

01:12:31.913 --> 01:12:36.451
Come on! Come on!

01:12:43.258 --> 01:12:47.829
- It's not working.
- Hey, hey, look at me, look. Look, look, hush, shh.

01:12:47.861 --> 01:12:51.532
You don't tell God,
you ask God.

01:12:55.236 --> 01:12:57.005
Now put your hand
in the water.

01:12:59.307 --> 01:13:00.876
Now on her.

01:13:04.579 --> 01:13:05.746
Again.

01:13:10.584 --> 01:13:11.853
And again.

01:13:19.994 --> 01:13:22.798
Ask God to use you.

01:14:29.696 --> 01:14:31.632
Sometimes his answer is no.

01:14:38.172 --> 01:14:40.241
No matter how much you want it.

01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:48.709
I'm sorry.

01:15:51.111 --> 01:15:53.914
We should probably get you
to the hospital or something.

01:15:56.049 --> 01:15:58.753
Nah, this is it for me.

01:16:01.856 --> 01:16:04.393
I spent most of my life
away from her.

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:11.065
So I'd like to start the next
one right here with her.

01:16:56.209 --> 01:16:57.411
Go.

01:19:33.467 --> 01:19:34.502
So?

01:19:39.941 --> 01:19:41.276
You'll be alright.

01:19:45.312 --> 01:19:47.681
So where are you
gonna roam off to next?

01:19:47.714 --> 01:19:50.284
Well, I don't know.

01:19:50.317 --> 01:19:53.120
Mitch said I could tie up here
anytime I want.

01:20:00.527 --> 01:20:01.695
It's nice.

01:20:01.728 --> 01:20:03.530
Hmm-mm, you think?

01:20:04.965 --> 01:20:07.002
I think
maybe it's a little cramped.

01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:12.474
A little cramped is not so bad,
you should see my place.

01:20:18.145 --> 01:20:19.281
Okay.

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:21.115
Oh, yeah?

01:20:23.985 --> 01:20:25.320
Yeah, that sounds nice.

01:20:28.588 --> 01:20:29.924
Alright.

01:20:34.128 --> 01:20:35.362
I gotta go see
about a ride.

01:20:35.396 --> 01:20:37.132
- Yeah, okay.
- Alright.

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:40.635
- Gal?
- Yeah?

01:20:41.468 --> 01:20:42.971
Pop, I don't want your money.

01:20:54.014 --> 01:20:55.016
Thank you.

01:20:59.419 --> 01:21:01.455
Mais, you're not supposed
to say thank you.

01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:15.102
Um...

01:21:24.210 --> 01:21:25.379
I love you.

01:21:33.387 --> 01:21:34.489
Yeah...

01:22:36.851 --> 01:22:39.387
- Hey.
- Hey yourself.

01:22:42.690 --> 01:22:48.062
Um... This ought to cover
last month's too.

01:22:50.563 --> 01:22:51.598
Thanks.

01:22:52.833 --> 01:22:53.835
Yeah.

01:22:55.169 --> 01:22:59.240
Hey, uh, can you come inside,
say hi?

01:23:01.741 --> 01:23:04.812
Uh, I don't think
it's a good idea right now.

01:23:06.312 --> 01:23:08.715
- You sure?
- Next time.

01:23:10.450 --> 01:23:12.252
Yeah, okay.

01:23:12.285 --> 01:23:13.654
- Alright.
- See ya then.

01:23:13.687 --> 01:23:14.823
Yeah.
