WEBVTT

00:04.526 --> 00:05.222
I HEAR THEY ALREADY
SOLD MORE TICKETS

00:05.266 --> 00:06.441
THAN THEY DID LAST YEAR.

00:06.484 --> 00:07.877
PROBABLY 'CAUSE
THEY HIRED ME

00:07.920 --> 00:09.009
TO CHOREOGRAPH
THE ROUTINE.

00:09.052 --> 00:10.271
AND BECAUSE OF
THE 8 HOTTIES

00:10.314 --> 00:12.882
WHO WILL BE PERFORMING
SAID ROUTINE.

00:12.925 --> 00:14.710
WHAT? I'M EXCITED
FOR YOU

00:14.753 --> 00:17.017
AND FOR THE EYE CANDY.
TWO THINGS CAN BE TRUE.

00:17.060 --> 00:18.931
MM. WELL,
MY SUPPORT IS PURE.

00:18.975 --> 00:20.498
I ALREADY GOT
A MAN, SO,

00:20.542 --> 00:24.111
NO EYE CANDY AND NO
DATE AUCTION FOR MOI.

00:24.154 --> 00:25.982
UM, IT'S NOT
AN AUCTION.

00:26.026 --> 00:28.028
WE DON'T AUCTION PEOPLE
AT HBCUs.

00:28.071 --> 00:30.073
OH. WELL, THEN
HOW DO YOU WIN DATES?

00:30.117 --> 00:31.596
BY DONATING
THE MOST MONEY,

00:31.640 --> 00:32.945
BUT IT ALL HAPPENS LIVE,

00:32.989 --> 00:35.557
EACH PERSON DONATING
MORE THAN THE LAST.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.298
SO, IT'S STILL
KIND OF GIVING--

00:37.341 --> 00:39.300
A BRILLIANT IDEA
FOR AN EVENT.

00:40.779 --> 00:42.042
THANK YOU.

00:43.956 --> 00:45.175
I LOVE YOUR HAIR.

00:46.394 --> 00:47.525
THANK YOU.

00:49.179 --> 00:51.268
-DEAL.
-THANKS FOR SIGNING UP
AND VOLUNTEERING.

00:51.312 --> 00:52.574
SEE YA.

00:54.489 --> 00:55.881
SO,
IF YOU'RE VOLUNTEERING,

00:55.925 --> 00:57.361
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU WANNA PLEDGE?

00:57.405 --> 00:58.884
GIRL, CAN YOU
PLEASE KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN?

00:58.928 --> 01:01.104
WHOA. WHY?

01:01.148 --> 01:02.845
BECAUSE I WOULD
LIKE TO PLEDGE,

01:02.888 --> 01:04.238
BUT DISCRETION IS KEY.

01:04.281 --> 01:05.848
THE EXQUISITE 8
DO NOT PUT

01:05.891 --> 01:08.155
THEIR PLEDGING BUSINESS
OUT IN THESE STREETS.

01:08.198 --> 01:09.678
THE LOW-KEY RUMOR
IS THAT

01:09.721 --> 01:12.724
PKZ'S OPEN TO
NON-BINARY PLEDGES,

01:12.768 --> 01:15.162
HENCE THE VOLUNTEERING.

01:15.205 --> 01:17.120
-NATE, THAT'S AMAZING.
-YEAH.

01:17.164 --> 01:19.209
YOU DO YOU, GIRL.

01:19.253 --> 01:21.603
AND I CAN SAY
THE SAME TO YOU.

01:21.646 --> 01:24.867
I KNOW THAT FACE.
IT'S JORDAN, ISN'T IT?

01:24.910 --> 01:26.564
-YEAH.
-MM.

01:26.608 --> 01:29.219
HE'S REMINDING ME OF
OUR VIRTUAL DATE TONIGHT.

01:29.263 --> 01:31.091
FORGOT TO PUT IT
ON THE CALENDAR.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.181
SCHEDULING PHONE SEX

01:34.224 --> 01:35.660
IS THE OPPOSITE
OF SEXY.

01:35.704 --> 01:38.010
OK, WELL, JORDAN AND I
ARE FULL-TIME

01:38.054 --> 01:40.578
STUDENTS AND ATHLETES WHO
LIVE ON DIFFERENT COASTS, SO,

01:40.622 --> 01:43.929
WE GONNA DO
WHAT WE GOTTA DO
TO STAY CONNECTED.

01:43.973 --> 01:45.583
-OK.
-OH.

01:45.627 --> 01:47.542
TERRY, THANKS FOR AGREEING
TO COACH AT THE SHOWCASE.

01:47.585 --> 01:49.631
I'LL EMAIL THE DETAILS.
TALK SOON.

01:51.067 --> 01:53.069
HEY, COACH?

01:53.113 --> 01:54.679
I'M A LITTLE BUSY
AT THE MOMENT.

01:54.723 --> 01:55.985
I JUST NEED
A MINUTE.

01:56.028 --> 01:57.291
I MADE
A MISTAKE AND

01:57.334 --> 01:59.380
I WANT TO COME BACK
ON THE TEAM.

01:59.423 --> 02:00.990
HAVE A SEAT.

02:03.645 --> 02:05.734
I APPRECIATE YOU WERE
HAVING A HARD TIME.

02:05.777 --> 02:08.171
WE REACT TO TOUGH MOMENTS
IN BIG WAYS.

02:08.215 --> 02:11.261
AND LIKE I TOLD YOU,
DECISIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES.

02:11.305 --> 02:13.176
I KNOW.
I DO.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.657
BUT COACH, I'VE GIVEN
THIS A LOT OF THOUGHT.

02:15.700 --> 02:18.094
MY PRIORITIES WEREN'T CLEAR
AT FIRST, BUT THEY ARE NOW.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.617
LOOK, I'M FINALIZING
PLANS FOR BRINGSTON

02:19.661 --> 02:21.619
TO HOST
AN HBCU SHOWCASE.

02:21.663 --> 02:23.795
IT'S GONNA GET US
NATIONAL MEDIA ATTENTION

02:23.839 --> 02:25.493
AND PROVE TO ALLEN
AND EVERYONE ELSE

02:25.536 --> 02:27.973
THAT THIS TEAM
IS WORTH SAVING.

02:28.017 --> 02:31.499
I'M LOOKING
FOR DEDICATION.
IS THAT YOU?

02:31.542 --> 02:33.283
YES, COACH.

02:33.327 --> 02:34.632
I THOUGHT I JOINED
THE TEAM BECAUSE

02:34.676 --> 02:36.460
MY DAD PLAYED BASEBALL
HERE AT BRINGSTON

02:36.504 --> 02:39.071
AND I WANTED TO
CONTINUE THE TRADITION.

02:39.115 --> 02:42.640
TURNS OUT, I WAS
ACTUALLY PLAYING FOR ME.

02:42.684 --> 02:45.643
I JUST DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT UNTIL I QUIT.

02:45.687 --> 02:47.732
COACH, IF YOU TURN
ME AWAY, I'M JUST GONNA

02:47.776 --> 02:49.169
FIND ANOTHER WAY TO PLAY

02:50.213 --> 02:51.258
EVEN IF IT'S NOT
FOR YOU.

02:51.301 --> 02:53.085
THAT'S HOW BAD
I WANT THIS.

02:53.129 --> 02:54.261
EVEN IF I WANTED YOU BACK,

02:54.304 --> 02:55.653
IT'S JUST NOT UP TO ME.

02:55.697 --> 02:58.439
TALK TO THE TEAM,
AND IF THEY AGREE,

02:58.482 --> 03:00.136
THERE'S STILL
A SPOT FOR YOU.

03:02.704 --> 03:05.924
THANKS, COACH.
YOU WON'T REGRET IT.

03:05.968 --> 03:07.665
GET OUTTA HERE, MAN.

03:07.709 --> 03:09.189
TAKE THAT.

03:11.843 --> 03:13.845
YOU KNOW IT'S 76
DEGREES OUTSIDE, RIGHT?

03:13.889 --> 03:16.283
UH, YEAH, BUT IT'S
RAINING IN CHICAGO.

03:16.326 --> 03:18.198
WAIT. YOU'RE GOING
TO CHICAGO?

03:18.241 --> 03:19.634
YEAH, JUST FOR
A DAY TO TALK

03:19.677 --> 03:21.375
TO MY DAD
ABOUT THE ADOPTION.

03:21.418 --> 03:24.116
MOM SAID HE WAS
HAVING A GOOD WEEK, SO,

03:24.160 --> 03:26.118
IF THERE WAS EVER
A TIME, RIGHT?

03:26.162 --> 03:27.598
I FEEL LIKE
HE'S MY LAST SHOT.

03:27.642 --> 03:29.644
YOU KNOW, IF HE CAN'T
ANSWER MY QUESTIONS,

03:29.687 --> 03:32.212
THEN I GOT NOBODY
ELSE TO ASK...

03:32.255 --> 03:35.215
DAMON, BREATHE. OK?

03:38.392 --> 03:41.133
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO GO TO CHICAGO,

03:41.177 --> 03:43.527
SO, HOW ABOUT
I COME WITH YOU?

03:43.571 --> 03:45.268
YOU--ARE YOU BEING
FOR REAL?

03:45.312 --> 03:47.357
-YEAH.
-LIKE, FOR REAL FOR REAL?

03:47.401 --> 03:49.446
YEAH. I HAVE
FREQUENT FLYER MILES.

03:49.490 --> 03:51.318
AT LEAST ENOUGH
TO COVER ONE WAY.

03:51.361 --> 03:52.493
I CAN SWING THE REST.

03:52.536 --> 03:53.537
YOU DO KNOW
WE HAVE TO LEAVE

03:53.581 --> 03:55.060
IN, LIKE, THE NEXT 15.

03:55.104 --> 03:56.758
WELL, THEN I'LL BE
READY IN THE NEXT 10.

03:58.325 --> 04:02.242
UH, SIMONE...THANKS.

04:14.602 --> 04:16.212

04:16.256 --> 04:18.910
LOOK,
I LOATHE THIS UNIVERSITY

04:18.954 --> 04:20.564
WITH MY ENTIRE HEART.

04:24.481 --> 04:26.309
I AM GETTING CALLS
FROM PARENTS.

04:26.353 --> 04:27.832
VISITS FROM
CONFUSED STUDENTS.

04:27.876 --> 04:29.399
A WEALTHY ALUM IS
QUESTIONING HIS DONATIONS.

04:29.443 --> 04:31.445
I'M NOT EXACTLY THRILLED
AN ANONYMOUS COWARD

04:31.488 --> 04:34.317
EDITED A VIDEO
AND PUT WORDS IN MY MOUTH.

04:34.361 --> 04:35.710
I REQUESTED IT
BE TAKEN DOWN...

04:35.753 --> 04:37.712
UNFORTUNATELY,
WE'RE BEYOND THAT.

04:37.755 --> 04:40.280
THE BOARD'S SEEN IT.
THEY'VE CALLED A HEARING

04:40.323 --> 04:42.934
TO DISCUSS YOUR FUTURE
AT THE UNIVERSITY.

04:42.978 --> 04:44.414
WHY WASN'T I INFORMED?

04:44.458 --> 04:46.024
YOUR PRESENCE
ISN'T REQUIRED.

04:46.068 --> 04:47.896
I'M NOT GONNA BE SHUT OUT
OF THIS CONVERSATION, ZEKE.

04:47.939 --> 04:50.115
I'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG.

04:50.159 --> 04:51.421
WHEN IS THE HEARING?

04:51.465 --> 04:53.118
THIS AFTERNOON.

04:53.162 --> 04:54.511
I'LL BE THERE.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.778

THAT DANCE CONTEST.

05:03.172 --> 05:07.307
HI. THANKS.

05:07.350 --> 05:08.786
OH. GIRL, I'M SORRY.

05:08.830 --> 05:10.527
I DIDN'T MEAN TO
FANGIRL LIKE THAT.

05:10.571 --> 05:12.355
I'M GABRIELLE.
OK, WAIT.

05:12.399 --> 05:14.792
LET'S JUST REWIND THIS.
I'M LOOKING FOR
CAM WATKINS,

05:14.836 --> 05:16.925

05:16.968 --> 05:19.928
-HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.
-THINK HE MAY BE

05:19.971 --> 05:21.364

05:37.641 --> 05:39.643
UH-UH.
WE DON'T COVER FOR FREE.

05:39.687 --> 05:41.819
IT'S GONNA COST YOU
AN EXPLANATION.

05:41.863 --> 05:44.866
WOW. WHATEVER. SHE RUNS AN
A CAPPELLA GROUP ON CAMPUS.

05:44.909 --> 05:47.564
THE ATLs.
SHE KEEPS BUGGING ME TO JOIN.

05:47.608 --> 05:49.174

05:49.218 --> 05:50.350
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT THEY'RE

05:50.393 --> 05:51.742
PERFORMING
AT THE GALA.

05:51.786 --> 05:53.353
LOOK, I TOLD HER
I'M ALREADY DOING

05:53.396 --> 05:54.876
THE SORORITY
AUCTION THING, AND I'M

05:54.919 --> 05:57.357
NOT REALLY INTERESTED
IN THE ATLs ANYWAY, BUT

05:57.400 --> 05:59.184
CLEARLY, SHE CAN'T
TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER.

05:59.228 --> 06:01.404
WHY DON'T YOU
WANT TO DO IT?

06:01.448 --> 06:03.101
I MEAN, IT SOUNDS DOPE.

06:03.145 --> 06:04.451
I'M AN ATHLETE.

06:04.494 --> 06:06.366
NOT SOME PERFORMING
ARTS WHATEVER.

06:13.503 --> 06:15.418

06:17.246 --> 06:20.205

06:36.787 --> 06:38.223
-YES, MA'AM.

07:51.383 --> 07:53.603
NO, I--I DON'T. WE--

07:53.647 --> 07:56.476
WE DON'T REALLY TALK ABOUT

07:57.520 --> 08:01.306
COME ON, GEORGE.

08:01.350 --> 08:02.569
YOU KNOW YOU'RE
NOT ADOPTED.

08:02.612 --> 08:03.961
EVEN IF I DID SAY IT

WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

08:08.400 --> 08:12.622

08:22.545 --> 08:23.677
YOU KNOW, JUST WANTED

MY NEPHEW

09:15.642 --> 09:17.208
HEH. THIS ONE DAY,

09:17.252 --> 09:18.688
THE FIRE HYDRANT
OUTSIDE BURST

09:18.732 --> 09:22.039
AND WATER WAS
SPRAYING EVERYWHERE.

09:22.083 --> 09:23.432
THEY HAD TO SHUT
THE STREET DOWN.

09:23.475 --> 09:25.477
OK, HEY,
THAT'S GOOD, XAVIER.

09:25.521 --> 09:27.958
BUT WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT A FIRE HYDRANT
RIGHT NOW, OK?

ABOUT SOME OF THE FUN THINGS
YOU USED TO DO WITH GEORGE?

10:17.138 --> 10:18.661
-WE USED TO PLAY BALL.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.707

10:20.750 --> 10:22.534
HE'S MY LITTLE BROTHER.

10:30.804 --> 10:35.591
I'M SORRY
HE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU.

10:35.635 --> 10:36.723
IT HAPPENS.
I WAS JUST HOPING

10:36.766 --> 10:38.159
THAT IT WOULDN'T

10:39.900 --> 10:41.641
OH, WE--WE GOTTA

10:41.684 --> 10:42.859
IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE

10:45.819 --> 10:46.994
IT'S COOL, SIMONE,
ALL RIGHT?

10:47.037 --> 10:48.473
I DON'T WANT
TO MESS UP ANYTHING

10:48.517 --> 10:49.561
YOU GOT GOING ON
TONIGHT OR TOMORROW.

10:49.605 --> 10:50.693
DAMON, YOU DON'T HAVE TO

10:50.737 --> 10:52.913
WORRY ABOUT THAT, OK?

10:52.956 --> 10:54.871
YOU NEED TO BE WITH
YOUR FAMILY RIGHT NOW.

11:00.398 --> 11:03.184
THANKS. THAT MEANS
A LOT.

11:04.925 --> 11:07.928
I'M GONNA TALK TO MY MOM

11:51.928 --> 11:54.104
I DIDN'T EXPECT
TO SEE YOU HERE.

11:54.148 --> 11:56.367
OH. YEAH,
WELL, I'VE BEEN

11:56.411 --> 11:58.543
COMPETING AGAINST WOMEN
MY WHOLE LIFE,

11:58.587 --> 12:02.025
SO, I THOUGHT THIS
MIGHT BE A CHANCE
TO BRANCH OUT.

12:02.069 --> 12:04.245
MAYBE, I DON'T KNOW,
MEET SOME NEW FRIENDS.

12:04.288 --> 12:05.855
YEAH, THAT SOUNDED
REALLY LAME.

12:05.899 --> 12:08.728
NO, IT DIDN'T.

12:20.609 --> 12:22.045

12:22.089 --> 12:23.612
DID I SEE YOU AT
ONE OF THE SEMINARS

12:23.655 --> 12:25.832

I LOVE IT.

12:31.620 --> 12:33.404
I'M GLAD YOU CAME

12:33.448 --> 12:34.710
NICE TALKING
TO YOU BOTH.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.712
-YOU, TOO.
-YEAH.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.714
IT LOOKS LIKE WE GOT

12:38.758 --> 12:40.803
I MEAN, SHE PROBABLY
KNOWS I'M A LEGACY.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.544
MY GRANDMOTHER
WAS A PKZ.

12:42.587 --> 12:45.765
BUT YOU, SHE REALLY SEEMED
TO LIKE YOU FOR YOU.

12:46.809 --> 12:48.637
YEAH. SHE DID.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.988

TRAVIS JUST DROPPED OUT.

12:52.032 --> 12:55.426
WHAT? WITH HIS TRIFLIN'--
WHATEVER.

12:55.470 --> 12:56.819
WHERE ARE WE GONNA
FIND ANOTHER BACHELOR

12:56.863 --> 12:58.125
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE?

13:00.170 --> 13:02.825
ACTUALLY, I THINK
I MIGHT KNOW

13:02.869 --> 13:04.261
THE PERFECT GUY.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.616
HEY. SIMONE,

13:11.660 --> 13:13.053
YOU WILL TAKE
DAMON'S ROOM.

13:13.096 --> 13:14.619
DAMON, YOU WILL
SLEEP ON THE COUCH.

13:14.663 --> 13:16.752
-THANK YOU.
-AND JUST A REMINDER.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.014
THE FLOORBOARDS
ARE CREAKY

13:18.058 --> 13:19.407
AND I AM A VERY
LIGHT SLEEPER.

13:19.450 --> 13:22.584
I WILL KNOW WHAT'S
HAPPENING IN THIS HOUSE.

13:22.627 --> 13:27.328
OK. UH, I'M GONNA GO
GET READY FOR BED NOW.

13:27.371 --> 13:29.721

-MM-MM. I'M GOOD.

13:39.166 --> 13:40.950
LOOK, MA, I KNOW
YOU'RE UPSET WITH ME.

13:40.994 --> 13:42.865
YOU KNOW
THE RULES, DAMON.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.606
YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED
TO ARGUE WITH HIM.

13:44.649 --> 13:49.089
HE JUST KEPT TELLING ME
THE SAME STORY
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

13:50.177 --> 13:52.048
ALL RIGHT?
I WAS JUST TRYING TO
REDIRECT HIM.

13:52.092 --> 13:54.877
LOOK, I'M SORRY, MA.
I--I THOUGHT YOU SAID

13:54.921 --> 13:57.140
THAT HE WAS--HE WAS
HAVING A GOOD DAY.

13:57.184 --> 13:58.707
HONEY, THIS WAS
A GOOD DAY.

13:58.750 --> 14:00.143
I HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN
AT SCHOOL THAT LONG

14:00.187 --> 14:01.492
AND HE'S GOTTEN
SO MUCH WORSE.

14:01.536 --> 14:03.843
EVERY DAY IS
DIFFERENT, BABY.

14:12.286 --> 14:15.158
I'M STILL ABLE
TO MANAGE HIS CARE

14:15.202 --> 14:18.727
BUT I'VE BEEN RESEARCHING

14:18.770 --> 14:20.990
WAIT. MEMORY FACILITIES?
WHAT?

14:21.034 --> 14:22.513
MOM, WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME?

14:23.906 --> 14:26.996
DAMON, YOU HAVE
A LOT ON YOUR PLATE.

14:27.040 --> 14:29.607
IT'S MY JOB TO TAKE CARE
OF YOUR FATHER.

14:29.651 --> 14:32.219
OK, BUT WHO'S SUPPOSED
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU, MOM?

14:37.789 --> 14:40.836
YOU CAN TALK TO ME.
LOOK, I WANT TO HELP.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.359
I WANT TO BE HERE

I THINK I'M DONE
WITH MY SEARCH.

14:57.331 --> 15:00.203
NO, BABY.
DON'T LET TODAY
DETER YOU.

15:02.510 --> 15:03.903
YOU AND DAD ARE...

15:05.905 --> 15:08.081

WHY ARE YOU HIDING
FROM JORDAN?

18:06.607 --> 18:07.782

18:07.825 --> 18:09.044
THAT I'M
AVOIDING JORDAN

18:09.088 --> 18:10.219
SO I DON'T
HAVE TO TELL HIM

18:10.263 --> 18:11.481

I DID A LOT OF THINGS
I'M NOT PROUD OF.

32:20.025 --> 32:21.461

THAT THERE'S HEALING

32:21.504 --> 32:23.898
IN LETTING FOLKS SEE
WHO YOU REALLY ARE,

32:23.942 --> 32:25.595

UNTIL I THOUGHT
HE WAS MY BROTHER.

32:35.301 --> 32:38.478

GAVE UP A SON FOR ADOPTION.

KINDA HOPED I'D PUT

THEN I FOUND OUT MY PARENTS
ARE GETTING A DIVORCE...

32:48.009 --> 32:50.055
AND I LOST IT.

I DIDN'T WANT TO
LIVE IN HIS SHADOW.

33:02.023 --> 33:04.069
I WAS ANGRY, SO,
I TANKED EVERYTHING.

33:04.112 --> 33:05.592
BUT ALL I ENDED UP
DOING WAS HURTING

33:05.635 --> 33:07.072

33:18.039 --> 33:21.477
NO. WE TOOK A DNA TEST.

33:21.521 --> 33:23.088
