WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.373
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.373 --> 00:05.106
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU WERE HAVING MONEY PROBLEMS?

00:05.106 --> 00:07.178
SUSAN MADE
A DIFFICULT DECISION.

00:07.178 --> 00:10.111
YOU CAN'T SELL YOUR HOUSE.
 WE'RE NOT SELLING.
WE'RE RENTING.

00:10.111 --> 00:12.043
BREE WAS BLACKMAILED BY SAM.

00:12.043 --> 00:15.616
I'M TALKING ABOUT YOUR SON
RUNNING DOWN CARLOS' MOTHER.

00:15.616 --> 00:19.190
I WANT YOU TO SIGN OVER
YOUR COMPANY TO ME.

00:19.190 --> 00:21.792
PATRICK GOT WHAT HE NEEDED

00:21.792 --> 00:24.155
TO FORCE ANGIE
TO DO WHAT HE WANTED.

00:24.155 --> 00:26.057
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME
ANOTHER BOMB.

00:26.057 --> 00:30.301
BUT ANGIE MANAGED TO SEND OUT
A CALL FOR HELP...

00:30.301 --> 00:35.066
AND LYNETTE DISCOVERED
THAT EDDIE WAS THE KILLER.

00:39.710 --> 00:42.243
(Mary Alice)
IN THOSE FIRST AWFUL MOMENTS,

00:42.243 --> 00:47.047
ALL LYNETTE SCAVO COULD
THINK OF WERE HER CHILDREN.

00:47.047 --> 00:52.123
SHE THOUGHT OF THE MOMENT
HER DAUGHTER BEGAN TO WALK...

00:52.123 --> 00:57.288
AND THE DAY HER SON
WON THE SPELLING BEE...

00:57.288 --> 01:01.532
AND THAT TIME HER TWINS
SCARED HER WITH A FROG.

01:03.834 --> 01:08.169
YES, THIS IS WHAT
LYNETTE THOUGHT ABOUT...

01:08.169 --> 01:13.574
WHILE A DISTURBED YOUNG MAN
WAS HOLDING HER HOSTAGE.

01:13.574 --> 01:14.805
EDDIE, PLEASE.

01:14.805 --> 01:17.308
(voice breaking) DON'T TALK
TO ME, MRS. SCAVO.

01:17.308 --> 01:20.551
I REALLY NEED TO THINK.
 I KNOW YOU MUST BE SCARED.

01:20.551 --> 01:22.813
BUT I AM YOUR FRIEND, EDDIE.
I WANT TO HELP.

01:22.813 --> 01:25.416
LOOK, WHAT--WHAT--
WHAT CAN YOU DO?

01:25.416 --> 01:27.118
YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

01:27.118 --> 01:31.392
I CAN TELL PEOPLE WHAT A MEAN,
ANGRY DRUNK YOUR MOTHER WAS,

01:31.392 --> 01:34.395
HOW SHE ABUSED YOU,
HOW DEFENSELESS YOU ARE.

01:34.395 --> 01:37.168
YOU ALMOST DIDN'T
HAVE A CHOICE.
 AND WHAT ABOUT THE OTHERS?

01:37.168 --> 01:38.629
WHAT OTHERS?

01:38.629 --> 01:41.372
THE OTHER GIRLS I KILLED.

01:45.536 --> 01:46.777
OH.

01:46.777 --> 01:50.581
STILL THINK YOU CAN HELP ME?
LOOK...

01:50.581 --> 01:52.583
I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU.

01:52.583 --> 01:56.647
LOOK, WE'LL DRIVE TILL
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

01:56.647 --> 01:59.150
I'LL DROP YOU OFF,
AND BY THE TIME

01:59.150 --> 02:02.523
YOU FIND ANYONE TO TELL,
I'LL BE GONE.
 NO.

02:02.523 --> 02:04.825
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
TO DO.

02:04.825 --> 02:07.198
I CAN'T HAVE YOU GOING
TO THE POLICE.
 I CAN'T GO ANYWHERE.

02:07.198 --> 02:09.460
YES.

02:09.460 --> 02:14.235
ALL LYNETTE COULD THINK ABOUT
WERE HER CHILDREN...

02:14.235 --> 02:16.467
MY WATER JUST BROKE.

02:18.339 --> 02:35.186
ESPECIALLY THE CHILD
SHE WAS ABOUT TO GIVE BIRTH TO.

02:35.186 --> 02:38.929
TERESA PRUITT
USED TO BE A NURSE.

02:38.929 --> 02:42.433
FOR 33 YEARS, SHE WORKED
IN THE MATERNITY WARD

02:42.433 --> 02:46.197
AT FAIRVIEW MEMORIAL HOSPITAL.

02:47.868 --> 02:51.902
SHE SPENT HER DAYS
CARING FOR NEWBORN INFANTS...

02:54.945 --> 02:58.579
AND LOOKING AFTER
BRAND-NEW MOTHERS.

03:01.412 --> 03:06.817
IT WAS A JOB SHE HAD LOVED
WITH ALL HER HEART.

03:06.817 --> 03:11.392
BUT THAT WAS MANY YEARS AGO.

03:11.392 --> 03:17.868
NOW TERESA PRUITT WAS BACK
AT FAIRVIEW MEMORIAL...

03:17.868 --> 03:20.901
BUT THIS TIME AS A PATIENT...

03:20.901 --> 03:26.237
A PATIENT WITH A SECRET.

03:28.439 --> 03:31.712
HELLO, TERESA.
I CAME AS SOON AS I COULD.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.213
(door closes)
 I'M SO SORRY.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.586
DON'T BE.

03:35.586 --> 03:36.947
IT'S MY TIME.

03:36.947 --> 03:39.550
YOU'RE VERY BRAVE.

03:39.550 --> 03:43.994
HMM, I WISH THAT WERE TRUE,
FATHER.

03:48.459 --> 03:53.304
DID YOU KNOW I USED TO BE
A NURSE IN THIS HOSPITAL?

03:53.304 --> 03:56.607
YES. YOU JUST RETIRED
A FEW YEARS AGO, RIGHT?

03:56.607 --> 04:01.342
I DIDN'T RETIRE.
I QUIT OUT OF GUILT.

04:01.342 --> 04:03.774
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

04:03.774 --> 04:06.947
I DID SOMETHING AWFUL.

04:06.947 --> 04:10.321
DO YOU WANT TO TAKE
CONFESSION?

04:10.321 --> 04:14.024
NO. CONFESSIONS ARE PRIVATE,

04:14.024 --> 04:16.726
AND THE PEOPLE WHO RUN
THIS HOSPITAL

04:16.726 --> 04:18.789
NEED TO KNOW WHAT I DID...

04:18.789 --> 04:24.264
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO
MAKE IT RIGHT.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.566
(elevator bell dings)

04:25.566 --> 04:28.268
(telephone ringing)

04:28.268 --> 04:29.970
(sighs) OH! EXCUSE ME.

04:29.970 --> 04:32.543
I NEED TO SEE NICK BOLEN.
WHAT ROOM IS HE IN?

04:32.543 --> 04:34.044
OH, I'M SORRY.

04:34.044 --> 04:36.407
VISITING HOURS
DON'T START UNTIL 9:00.

04:36.407 --> 04:38.979
OKAY, BUT THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.

04:38.979 --> 04:41.452
MA'AM, HE JUST CAME IN
OUT OF A COMA.

04:41.452 --> 04:44.685
UNLESS YOU'RE IMMEDIATE FAMILY,
YOU NEED TO COME BACK AT 9:00.

04:44.685 --> 04:45.986
OKAY, I GET IT.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.988
YOU'RE JUST FOLLOWING
THE RULES.

04:47.988 --> 04:52.593
YOU'RE A NURSE--AN UNDERPAID,
UNDERAPPRECIATED NURSE

04:52.593 --> 04:56.397
WHO MIGHT NEED SOME HELP
MAKING ENDS MEET.

04:56.397 --> 05:01.332
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY TO--
AHEM--$12?

05:03.574 --> 05:06.607
OH, WAIT. I'M GONNA NEED
$10 FOR PARKING.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.379
MA'AM.

05:08.379 --> 05:11.011
(sighs) HOW ABOUT GUM?
DO YOU LIKE GUM?

05:11.011 --> 05:12.713
COME BACK LATER.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.084
(sighs)

05:16.717 --> 05:20.621
HEY, LORNA, DR. BURKE
NEEDS YOU IN RADIOLOGY.

05:20.621 --> 05:23.023
THANKS.

05:23.023 --> 05:26.026
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

05:32.603 --> 05:35.035
(imitates New York accent)
HEY! YOU WITH THE PONYTAIL.

05:35.035 --> 05:37.668
I GOTTA SEE NICK BOLEN.
 ARE YOU FAMILY?

05:37.668 --> 05:39.840
FUGGEDABOUTIT.
I'M HIS WIFE ANGIE.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.343
REALLY? WELL, THEN WHO'S THAT
BLONDE LADY WHO'S BEEN HERE?

05:43.343 --> 05:46.947
HIS WHORE?! SHE WAS HERE?
OH, I'M HAVING HER WHACKED!

05:46.947 --> 05:48.919
OH, NO! I COULD BE WRONG.

05:48.919 --> 05:50.951
MAYBE I SHOULD GET
MY SUPERVISOR.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.953
DO I LOOK LIKE
I GOT TIME FOR SUPERVISORS?

05:52.953 --> 05:55.956
I GOT SAUCE ON THE STOVE,
ZITI IN THE OVEN

05:55.956 --> 05:58.959
AND A MUSTACHE THAT NEEDS
TO GET BLEACHED. LET'S GO!

05:58.959 --> 06:00.931
COME ON! LET'S GO!

06:08.469 --> 06:09.840
THANK YOU.

06:09.840 --> 06:11.802
(chuckles) W-WOW.

06:11.802 --> 06:15.375
DID WE--DID WE GET HAMMERED
LAST NIGHT OR WHAT?

06:15.375 --> 06:17.047
NO, YOU GOT HAMMERED.

06:17.047 --> 06:20.551
PRES AND I JUST FOLLOWED YOU
AROUND APOLOGIZING TO EVERYONE.

06:20.551 --> 06:22.913
MM, ANOTHER THING WE WON'T BE
TELLING YOUR MOM.

06:22.913 --> 06:25.916
HEY, DO YOU THINK I WOKE HER UP
WHEN I CAME IN?

06:25.916 --> 06:27.918
WHEN YOU CAME IN?
 YEAH.

06:27.918 --> 06:30.120
NO. WHEN YOU JUMPED UP
ON THE COFFEE TABLE

06:30.120 --> 06:31.822
AND SANG "MARGARITAVILLE"?
MAYBE.
 (door opens and closes)

06:31.822 --> 06:35.596
GUYS. I JUST CHECKED ON MOM,
AND SHE'S NOT THERE,

06:35.596 --> 06:38.829
AND THE BED LOOKS LIKE
IT HASN'T BEEN SLEPT IN.

06:38.829 --> 06:40.831
OH, GOD. SHE DID HEAR ME.

06:40.831 --> 06:44.505
OH, SHE MUST HAVE STORMED
OUT OF HERE FIRST THING.

06:44.505 --> 06:47.177
BUT WHY DIDN'T SHE WAKE YOU UP
AND YELL AT YOU?

06:47.177 --> 06:48.879
HAVE I BEEN STABBED?

06:52.843 --> 06:56.016
YOU'RE BACK.
WHAT HAPPENED WITH SAM?

06:56.016 --> 06:59.850
AND DID YOU TELL HIM HIS
SERVICES WERE NO LONGER NEEDED?

06:59.850 --> 07:03.093
I TRIED TO. HE RESPONDED
BY BLACKMAILING ME.

07:03.093 --> 07:04.955
WHAT?

07:04.955 --> 07:08.098
HE KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED
TO MRS. SOLIS.

07:11.061 --> 07:13.764
GABY. WHAT DOES SHE
HAVE TO DO WITH THIS?

07:13.764 --> 07:16.066
I'M TALKING
ABOUT CARLOS' MOTHER.

07:16.066 --> 07:18.138
WHAT HAPPENED
TO CARLOS' MOTHER?

07:18.138 --> 07:22.012
TEN YEARS AGO, SHE DIED AFTER
BEING HIT BY A CAR

07:22.012 --> 07:24.014
THAT ANDREW WAS DRIVING.

07:24.014 --> 07:26.076
OH, MY GOD.

07:26.076 --> 07:29.219
HOW DID HE FIND OUT?
 DANIELLE TOLD HIM.

07:29.219 --> 07:31.121
WHAT? WHY?
 I DON'T KNOW.

07:31.121 --> 07:34.525
I THINK IT WAS SOME IDIOTIC
ATTEMPT TO BOND WITH HIM.

07:34.525 --> 07:35.986
WAIT A MINUTE.

07:35.986 --> 07:38.729
YOU NEVER TOLD
CARLOS AND GABY?

07:38.729 --> 07:41.061
OF COURSE NOT. THAT WOULD HAVE
DESTROYED THE FRIENDSHIP,

07:41.061 --> 07:44.464
NOT TO MENTION CARLOS WOULD HAVE
SENT ANDREW TO JAIL.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.897
SO WHAT DOES SAM WANT?

07:46.897 --> 07:50.100
MY COMPANY,
AND I'M GOING TO GIVE IT TO HIM.

07:50.100 --> 07:52.903
ARE YOU CRAZY?
 IF I DON'T,
HE'LL GO TO THE POLICE.

07:52.903 --> 07:54.775
LET HIM.
 ANDREW!

07:54.775 --> 07:57.778
MOM, I'M NOT LETTING YOU GIVE UP
EVERYTHING YOU'VE WORKED FOR

07:57.778 --> 08:00.751
JUST 'CAUSE THAT PSYCHO THINKS
HE HAS SOMETHING OVER ON US.
 THEY WILL SEND YOU TO PRISON.

08:00.751 --> 08:03.714
WELL, MAYBE IT'S TIME I PAID FOR
WHAT I'VE DONE.
 ABSOLUTELY NOT.

08:03.714 --> 08:06.717
BREE, YOU CAN'T GIVE IN
TO BLACKMAIL. IT'S NOT RIGHT.

08:06.717 --> 08:09.089
AND IF ANDREW WANTS
TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY--

08:09.089 --> 08:12.923
ORSON, THIS IS REALLY
JUST BETWEEN ME AND MY SON.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.226
WOULD YOU MIND?

08:16.226 --> 08:19.570
OF COURSE NOT.

08:24.234 --> 08:27.137
(inhales and exhales deeply)

08:27.137 --> 08:28.639
(spits)

08:28.639 --> 08:32.212
(monitor beeping steadily)

08:32.212 --> 08:33.914
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:33.914 --> 08:36.687
W-WHY AM I WET?

08:36.687 --> 08:38.549
BEATS ME.
I'M NOT A DOCTOR.

08:38.549 --> 08:42.022
(clatter)
 GABY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOIN' HERE?

08:42.022 --> 08:45.025
ANGIE'S IN TROUBLE.
LOOK, SHE WROTE ME THIS NOTE.

08:45.025 --> 08:48.659
"DANNY AND I HELD HOSTAGE.
NO COPS. GET NICK."

08:48.659 --> 08:50.300
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

08:50.300 --> 08:54.004
THERE WAS A GUY WITH HER.
HE SAID HE WAS HER BROTHER.

08:54.004 --> 08:56.236
SHE DOESN'T HAVE A BROTHER.

08:56.236 --> 08:58.038
IS IT PATRICK LOGAN?

08:59.710 --> 09:01.271
YOU KNOW ABOUT PATRICK?

09:01.271 --> 09:03.113
SHE TOLD ME EVERYTHING.

09:03.113 --> 09:05.916
WHOA, WHOA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:05.916 --> 09:08.118
(grunts) I GOTTA GET HIM
OUTTA THERE.

09:08.118 --> 09:10.220
WAIT. ARE YOU CRAZY?
IN YOUR CONDITION?

09:10.220 --> 09:12.222
WHY CAN'T WE JUST
CALL THE COPS?

09:12.222 --> 09:14.224
BECAUSE THE SECOND
PATRICK FEELS CORNERED,

09:14.224 --> 09:16.226
ANGIE AND DANNY ARE DEAD.

09:16.226 --> 09:19.760
(sighs) OH, MY GOD.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.232
ARE YOU GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?

09:22.232 --> 09:24.564
NO. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DRIVE ME

09:24.564 --> 09:27.067
TO HELP ME
GET HIM OUTTA THERE.
 OKAY.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.940
I KNOW. I'M SORRY. I'M PUTTING
YOU IN A DANGEROUS POSITION.

09:29.940 --> 09:33.774
(imitating New York accent)
FUGGEDABOUTIT.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.779
SO YOU'RE DONE?

09:38.779 --> 09:40.811
YES.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.185
WHEN YOU PUSH THE DETONATOR,

09:45.185 --> 09:47.187
YOU GOT 30 SECONDS
TILL IT BLOWS.

09:50.290 --> 09:53.964
YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED.
YOU GONNA LET US GO NOW?

09:53.964 --> 09:59.770
NOT YET. YOU'RE COMING
WITH ME TO OREGON.

09:59.770 --> 10:02.072
YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT.

10:02.072 --> 10:03.333
ANGE...

10:03.333 --> 10:05.936
WHAT IF THE BOMB'S A DUD?

10:05.936 --> 10:09.179
I MEAN, YOU DID RUN OFF WITH
ANOTHER MAN AND TAKE MY SON.

10:09.179 --> 10:12.082
I'VE GOT SOME TRUST ISSUES.

10:12.082 --> 10:15.215
WILL YOU AT LEAST
LET DANNY GO?

10:15.215 --> 10:20.390
NO. SEE, IF THE BOMB
DOESN'T GO OFF,

10:20.390 --> 10:23.053
I'LL PUT A BULLET
IN YOUR HEAD

10:23.053 --> 10:25.926
AND THEN COME BACK
AND KILL HIM.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.803
SO...

10:32.803 --> 10:35.966
YOU SURE YOU'RE DONE?

10:38.208 --> 10:42.072
I GUESS I COULD TAKE
ANOTHER LOOK.

10:50.150 --> 10:53.223
(indistinct conversations)

10:53.223 --> 10:55.655
MY GRANDSON'S VISITING.
HE'LL LOVE THIS.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.887
AW.

10:56.887 --> 10:58.889
HOW ABOUT WE GIVE YOU
100 BUCKS?

10:58.889 --> 11:01.331
LOOK AT THE PRICE TAG.
50 CENTS.

11:01.331 --> 11:03.333
PLEASE, SUSAN.
LET US HELP YOU.

11:03.333 --> 11:06.036
I DON'T NEED MY ARTHRITIS
MEDICATION THIS MONTH.

11:06.036 --> 11:08.098
LOOK, I CAN ALMOST
MAKE A FIST.

11:08.098 --> 11:12.242
THANK YOU, BUT WE'RE NOT LOOKING
FOR A HANDOUT. JUST A HAND.

11:12.242 --> 11:14.404
HEY, I JUST GOT OFF
THE PHONE WITH LEE.

11:14.404 --> 11:17.047
HE THINKS HE MIGHT HAVE
FOUND A RENTER.
 ALREADY?

11:17.047 --> 11:19.079
WELL, THAT'S A GOOD THING,
ISN'T IT?

11:19.079 --> 11:20.380
YEAH, YEAH. IT'S GREAT.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.913
STRANGER LIVING IN MY HOUSE--
YIPPEE!

11:22.913 --> 11:27.057
HEY, SUSAN, HOW MUCH FOR
THIS DINING ROOM SET?

11:27.057 --> 11:30.761
I PAID $1,200 A YEAR AGO.
YOU CAN HAVE IT FOR $300.

11:30.761 --> 11:34.194
I'LL GIVE YOU 50 BUCKS.

11:34.194 --> 11:37.067
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T LOOKING
FOR A HANDOUT, JUST A HAND.

11:37.067 --> 11:39.099
THAT'S NOT A HAND.
THAT'S A FINGER.

11:39.099 --> 11:44.134
SUSAN, I'M NOT NEIGHBOR KINSKY
RIGHT NOW. I'M BUSINESS KINSKY.

11:44.134 --> 11:45.435
SO I'M GONNA BE FRANK.

11:45.435 --> 11:48.138
YOU DON'T HAVE A POT
TO PEE-PEE IN RIGHT NOW,

11:48.138 --> 11:50.841
AND OUR NEIGHBORHOOD
KNOWS IT. WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?

11:50.841 --> 11:54.084
JEEZ, KINSKY. HAVE A HEART.
THE WOMAN NEEDS THE MONEY.

11:54.084 --> 11:56.917
OH, KEEP OUT OF IT, McCLUSKEY.
YOU KNOW THE YARD SALE GAME.

11:56.917 --> 11:59.289
IF YOU LOST THE STOMACH FOR IT,
WALK AWAY.

11:59.289 --> 12:02.192
NO, MITZI. YOU WALK AWAY.

12:02.192 --> 12:03.223
EXCUSE ME?

12:03.223 --> 12:05.225
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A VULTURE.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.058
I WANT YOU OFF MY PROPERTY.

12:10.060 --> 12:12.162
HEY, LOOKIE HERE.

12:12.162 --> 12:16.066
I'M ON A PUBLIC SIDEWALK.
NOW WHAT YOU GONNA DO?

12:18.238 --> 12:22.412
MITZI,
I AM NOT "NEIGHBOR" DELFINO.

12:22.412 --> 12:25.115
I AM "WOMAN WHO'S ABOUT
TO MOVE INTO AN APARTMENT

12:25.115 --> 12:27.117
BEHIND A GAS STATION" DELFINO,

12:27.117 --> 12:29.419
AND IF YOU DON'T GET OUT
OF MY FACE,

12:29.419 --> 12:32.222
I AM GONNA RAM THIS
THIGH MASTER DOWN YOUR THROAT.

12:32.222 --> 12:35.856
FINE. $300.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.928
SOLD.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.296
(Lynette moaning)

12:46.296 --> 12:48.999
I FOUND SOME ASPIRIN.
WILL THAT HELP?

12:48.999 --> 12:53.944
THIS ISN'T A HEADACHE.
THESE ARE CONTRACTIONS.

12:53.944 --> 12:56.847
I NEED YOU
TO TAKE ME TO A HOSPITAL.

12:56.847 --> 12:59.409
NO, I C--
YOU'LL TELL SOMEONE ABOUT ME.

12:59.409 --> 13:02.412
EDDIE, I SWEAR TO GOD. I DON'T
CARE ABOUT YOU RIGHT NOW.

13:02.412 --> 13:07.287
ALL I CARE ABOUT
IS THIS BABY. PLEASE.

13:09.860 --> 13:12.162
PORTER, I FOUND HER.
SHE'S AT EDDIE'S.

13:12.162 --> 13:14.164
IF I'M NOT BACK IN 15 MINUTES,

13:14.164 --> 13:16.867
IT MEANS SHE DID NOT ACCEPT
MY APOLOGY,

13:16.867 --> 13:20.200
AND IT WAS FUN BEING YOUR DAD.
 (beep)

13:20.200 --> 13:24.134
OKAY. I'M TRUSTING YOU HERE.

13:24.134 --> 13:27.908
THANK YOU. YOU HAVE MY WORD.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.539
(knock on door)
 (Tom) EDDIE! IT'S TOM!

13:29.539 --> 13:31.111
(gasps)

13:31.111 --> 13:33.213
I NEED TO TALK TO HIM AGAIN.

13:33.213 --> 13:35.245
(grunts)
 (whispering) Quiet.

13:35.245 --> 13:39.419
HONEY! I CAN SEE YOUR CAR.
I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE.

13:39.419 --> 13:40.991
LYNETTE!

13:40.991 --> 13:44.024
(gasping)

13:46.556 --> 13:49.159
(groaning)

13:49.159 --> 13:51.031
(Tom) OKAY, I GET IT.

13:51.031 --> 13:53.033
YOU'RE GIVING ME
THE SILENT TREATMENT.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.965
WELL, WHEN YOU COOL OFF,

13:54.965 --> 13:56.266
I WILL BE HOME

13:56.266 --> 14:00.170
WITH A GIGANTIC BOUQUET
OF YOUR FAVORITE FLOWERS.

14:00.170 --> 14:04.244
(Lynette grunting)

14:04.244 --> 14:07.047
(muffled groaning)

14:07.047 --> 14:08.218
I'M SORRY.

14:08.218 --> 14:09.379
I'M SORRY.

14:09.379 --> 14:11.321
(panting and crying)

14:11.321 --> 14:13.353
I HAD TO DO THAT.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.187
I'LL TAKE YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL NOW.

14:17.187 --> 14:22.432
IT'S TOO LATE. IT'S TOO LATE.
THIS BABY IS COMING NOW.

14:22.432 --> 14:29.940
(exhales deeply) AND YOU HAVE
TO HELP ME DELIVER IT.

14:39.649 --> 14:41.651
MR. CHASE,
YOU GOT A MINUTE?

14:41.651 --> 14:43.313
OH, SURE, FATHER.
COME ON IN.

14:43.313 --> 14:45.315
I JUST CAME FROM
TERESA PRUITT'S BEDSIDE.

14:45.315 --> 14:47.587
SHE PASSED.

14:47.587 --> 14:50.961
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
I, UH, I REMEMBER HER FONDLY.

14:50.961 --> 14:52.963
SHE WAS ONE
OF MY BEST NURSES.

14:52.963 --> 14:57.127
BEFORE SHE DIED,
SHE TOLD ME SOMETHING--

14:57.127 --> 15:00.230
AN AWFUL SECRET THAT SHE'D
BEEN LIVING WITH FOR YEARS.

15:00.230 --> 15:03.233
UH, FATHER, I'M, UH,
I'M NOT TRYING TO TELL YOU

15:03.233 --> 15:05.235
HOW TO DO YOUR BUSINESS,

15:05.235 --> 15:07.938
BUT AREN'T THOSE THINGS
SUPPOSED TO BE CONFIDENTIAL?

15:07.938 --> 15:09.940
SHE WANTED YOU TO HEAR THIS,

15:09.940 --> 15:12.182
BUT I THINK
YOU SHOULD SIT DOWN FIRST.

15:16.416 --> 15:19.419
HEY, LADY, UNLESS YOU WANT
TO BE CARRIED INTO THE TRUCK,

15:19.419 --> 15:21.451
YOU NEED TO GET OFF
THAT CHAIR.

15:21.451 --> 15:24.624
I SEE. LIKE YOU'RE THE MOVER.
FUNNY.

15:26.256 --> 15:29.399
HAVE YOU SEEN T-REX?

15:29.399 --> 15:31.401
THE DINOSAUR?
WELL, CHECK IN THE BOXES.

15:31.401 --> 15:33.533
NO, HONEY.
WE SOLD IT TO ROY.

15:33.533 --> 15:34.965
NO!

15:34.965 --> 15:36.566
YEAH. YOU PUT IT
IN THE "SELL" PILE.

15:36.566 --> 15:38.408
WHAT'S A "SELL" PILE?

15:38.408 --> 15:40.470
UH-OH.

15:41.711 --> 15:43.343
I WANT MY T-REX.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.345
WELL, BUDDY, I'M SORRY.
WE SOLD IT,

15:45.345 --> 15:47.517
SO THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN...
 WE'RE GETTING IT BACK.

15:47.517 --> 15:51.081
(under breath)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
 (lowers voice) LOVING MY CHILD.

15:51.081 --> 15:53.623
THANK YOU, MOMMY.

15:53.623 --> 15:55.185
(sighs)

15:55.185 --> 15:58.188
SUSAN, I DON'T THINK YOU
SHOULD HAVE PROMISED HIM THAT.

15:58.188 --> 15:59.990
ROY BOUGHT IT
FOR HIS GRANDSON.

15:59.990 --> 16:01.992
IT'S BAD ENOUGH
THAT WE ARE DRAGGING HIM

16:01.992 --> 16:04.995
FROM THE ONLY HOME
HE HAS EVER LIVED IN,

16:04.995 --> 16:07.167
MOVING ACROSS TOWN WHERE
HE DOESN'T KNOW A SINGLE SOUL.

16:07.167 --> 16:09.369
IF THAT SILLY DINOSAUR
BRINGS HIM A MOMENT'S COMFORT,

16:09.369 --> 16:13.443
THEN WE NEED TO MARCH
OVER THERE AND TAKE IT BACK.

16:13.443 --> 16:15.145
(sighs)

16:15.145 --> 16:17.147
WHAT THE HELL?
WE'RE MOVING.

16:17.147 --> 16:19.449
LET'S GO PISS OFF
SOME NEIGHBORS.

16:19.449 --> 16:20.980
(sighs)

16:23.483 --> 16:26.216
AND SOMEHOW THE DINOSAUR
GOT INTO THE PILE,

16:26.216 --> 16:28.718
AND NOW M.J. IS BEGGING US
TO GET IT BACK.

16:28.718 --> 16:30.190
SORRY FOR THE CONFUSION, ROY.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.162
NO, I GET IT. IT'S JUST...

16:32.162 --> 16:35.165
I ALREADY GAVE IT
TO MY GRANDSON.

16:35.165 --> 16:39.569
AW, I REMEMBER WHEN
WE GAVE IT TO M.J...

16:39.569 --> 16:42.232
RIGHT AFTER HIS PUPPY DIED.

16:42.232 --> 16:43.573
OKAY, OKAY.

16:43.573 --> 16:47.707
LET'S GO GET IT BEFORE
YOU TAKE OUT YOUR VIOLIN.

16:49.679 --> 16:52.182
I GUESS THE EXCITEMENT
OF GETTING A NEW FRIEND

16:52.182 --> 16:54.013
WORE HIM OUT.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.646
I'LL WAKE HIM UP.
 OH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

16:56.646 --> 16:59.649
WHY DON'T YOU JUST SLIP IT OUT
OF HIS ARMS?

16:59.649 --> 17:02.052
AND WE'LL LEAVE A NOTE.
 A NOTE?

17:02.052 --> 17:05.023
AND CASH.
MIKE, GIVE THE MAN SOME CASH.

17:05.023 --> 17:07.557
NO, WE'RE NOT TAKING MONEY.
HE'S GOT TONS OF OTHER TOYS.

17:07.557 --> 17:10.160
HE'LL BE FINE. (grunts)

17:15.405 --> 17:18.338
(lowers voice)
OH, GOD, HE'S DEAF.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.339
(grunts)

17:20.339 --> 17:22.212
SHOULDN'T WE STOP THIS?

17:23.573 --> 17:25.275
(grunts)

17:25.275 --> 17:29.179
(lowers voice)
JUST LET IT PLAY OUT.

17:31.321 --> 17:34.284
(sighs) THERE YOU GO.

17:34.284 --> 17:36.286
YOU ARE NOW THE SOLE OWNER

17:36.286 --> 17:39.289
OF MRS. VAN DE KAMP'S
OLD FASHIONED FOODS.

17:39.289 --> 17:42.292
OF COURSE, MY LAWYERS
WILL HAVE TO APPROVE THIS.

17:42.292 --> 17:44.794
OF COURSE, AND YOU'LL SEE
THERE'S A CODICIL.

17:44.794 --> 17:46.796
IF YOU BREATHE ONE WORD

17:46.796 --> 17:48.798
OF ANDREW'S INVOLVEMENT
IN THAT INCIDENT,

17:48.798 --> 17:52.302
YOU'LL BE FORCED TO PAY ME
ALL SORTS OF MONEY.

17:52.302 --> 17:54.704
DON'T WORRY. I'M MUCH BETTER
AT KEEPING SECRETS

17:54.704 --> 17:56.206
THAN YOUR DAUGHTER.

17:56.206 --> 17:58.548
ONE CAN ONLY HOPE.

17:58.548 --> 18:03.613
I DIDN'T WANT IT
TO BE THIS WAY.

18:03.613 --> 18:09.319
AND I UNDERSTAND
IF YOU NEED TO HATE ME.

18:10.790 --> 18:15.395
I DON'T HATE YOU, SAM.
I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.797
YOU CAME INTO MY LIFE HOPING

18:17.797 --> 18:20.800
TO BE A PART OF MY FAMILY,
AND ALL YOU'RE LEAVING WITH

18:20.800 --> 18:24.304
IS A CLIENT LIST,
SOME MIXING BOWLS AND MY NAME.

18:24.304 --> 18:27.437
WELL, YOU'LL SOON SEE
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.

18:27.437 --> 18:30.140
YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE
A HOLE IN YOUR HEART

18:30.140 --> 18:32.442
BECAUSE YOU DON'T REALLY
CARE ABOUT ANYBODY,

18:32.442 --> 18:34.444
AND I HAVE A HORRIBLE FEELING

18:34.444 --> 18:38.248
THAT NO ONE WILL EVER
REALLY CARE ABOUT YOU.

18:41.251 --> 18:43.553
NOW WOULD YOU
PLEASE BE A DEAR

18:43.553 --> 18:48.758
AND CLOSE THE DOOR
ON YOUR WAY OUT OF MY LIFE?

18:53.563 --> 18:56.266
SO I'M GONNA PUT THE BOMB
IN THE TRUNK,

18:56.266 --> 19:00.740
AND THAT'S HOW LONG YOU HAVE
TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO OUR SON.

19:22.932 --> 19:26.165
YOU CAN'T GO WITH HIM. HE'S
NEVER GONNA LET YOU COME BACK.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.468
I DON'T KNOW HOW
THIS IS GONNA PLAY OUT,

19:28.468 --> 19:30.470
BUT WHATEVER HAPPENS,
YOU GOTTA KNOW,

19:30.470 --> 19:33.273
THAT I WAS OUT OF CHOICES.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.875
OKAY, ANGE. CAR'S LOADED.

19:37.307 --> 19:38.808
COME ON.

19:40.310 --> 19:43.383
WE GOT A BOMB TO EXPLODE.

19:43.383 --> 19:46.286
OKAY, OKAY.
I GOTTA PUSH AGAIN.

19:46.286 --> 19:49.389
NO, YOU HAVE TO LOOK.

19:49.389 --> 19:52.922
BUT IT'S SO GROSS!
 I DON'T CARE. YOU'RE GOING TO
TO HAVE TO CATCH HER. GO.

19:52.922 --> 19:59.299
(groaning)

19:59.299 --> 20:02.572
I SEE SOMETHING!
I THINK IT'S THE HEAD!

20:02.572 --> 20:03.903
AAH!

20:03.903 --> 20:05.875
WAIT. THERE'S SOMETHING
AROUND HER NECK!

20:05.875 --> 20:07.877
(panting)

20:07.877 --> 20:10.240
WHAT?

20:10.240 --> 20:13.243
I THINK
IT'S THE UMBILICAL CORD.

20:13.243 --> 20:15.345
NO! NO!

20:15.345 --> 20:17.287
SHE'S TURNING BLUE.

20:17.287 --> 20:20.990
OKAY. OKAY. UM...

20:20.990 --> 20:22.992
LISTEN TO ME.

20:22.992 --> 20:24.994
YOU HAVE TO... HOOK
THE UMBILICAL CORD

20:24.994 --> 20:27.627
WITH YOUR FINGER
AND PULL IT OVER HER HEAD.

20:27.627 --> 20:29.759
NO, I CAN'T.
 YOU HAVE TO!

20:29.759 --> 20:31.601
NO, MRS. SCAVO,
I'M SERIOUS!

20:31.601 --> 20:33.303
LISTEN TO ME.

20:33.303 --> 20:37.837
YOU HAVE THE CHANCE
TO SAVE... A LIFE.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.309
(panting)

20:39.309 --> 20:41.341
PLEASE!

20:41.341 --> 20:45.315
(panting)

20:45.315 --> 20:48.778
OKAY. (continues panting)

20:48.778 --> 20:51.451
OH, OH, IS IT DONE?

20:51.451 --> 20:53.323
YEAH. I GOT HER.

20:53.323 --> 20:54.824
YES! YES!
 YES.

20:54.824 --> 20:56.786
(grunts)

20:59.729 --> 21:01.391
(gasps)

21:01.391 --> 21:03.293
(crying)

21:03.293 --> 21:05.665
(gasps) SHE'S OKAY?

21:05.665 --> 21:07.437
(crying continues)

21:07.437 --> 21:08.968
OH!

21:08.968 --> 21:11.601
AHH!

21:14.374 --> 21:15.905
THANK YOU.

21:15.905 --> 21:18.277
(baby crying)

21:18.277 --> 21:19.449
I KNOW.

21:19.449 --> 21:21.311
(crying)

21:31.821 --> 21:33.563
WHERE IS HE?

21:33.563 --> 21:37.627
I'M SORRY, SWEETIE.
T-REX IS EXTINCT.

21:37.627 --> 21:41.571
YEAH, BUDDY. I'M SORRY WE
COULDN'T GET HIM BACK FOR YA.

21:41.571 --> 21:44.874
BUT HE'S MINE.
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

21:44.874 --> 21:47.437
M.J...

21:47.437 --> 21:50.480
THAT'S LIFE.
LIFE ISN'T ALWAYS FAIR.

21:50.480 --> 21:52.842
SOMETIMES YOU CAN BE
A GOOD PERSON

21:52.842 --> 21:54.844
AND YOU CAN DO
THE RIGHT THING,

21:54.844 --> 21:57.747
AND LIFE STILL WON'T GIVE YOU
YOUR DINOSAUR BACK.

22:01.090 --> 22:02.722
IN OTHER WORDS,

22:02.722 --> 22:04.724
WE'RE GONNA TAKE YOU
TO PIZZA WORLD,

22:04.724 --> 22:07.457
AND YOU CAN PLAY
ALL THE VIDEO GAMES YOU WANT.

22:07.457 --> 22:08.928
OKAY.

22:17.537 --> 22:20.440
SUSAN, LIFE DIDN'T TAKE
YOUR DINOSAUR.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.472
I DID.

22:22.472 --> 22:25.014
SO PLEASE,
JUST LET ME HAVE IT.

22:25.014 --> 22:28.818
OKAY. YEAH.

22:28.818 --> 22:30.480
I RESENT YOU.

22:30.480 --> 22:33.823
I LOVE YOU, I RESPECT YOU,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:33.823 --> 22:36.526
I MEAN, YOU BLEW IT!
AND THANKS TO YOU,

22:36.526 --> 22:40.359
I HAVE TO LEAVE THE HOME WHERE
I RAISED MY CHILDREN. LOOK.

22:40.359 --> 22:43.362
LOOK, THIS--
THIS IS HOW TALL JULIE WAS

22:43.362 --> 22:44.664
WHEN SHE STARTED
KINDERGARTEN.

22:44.664 --> 22:47.467
AND--AND THIS IS HER
IN JUNIOR HIGH.

22:47.467 --> 22:48.768
AND THIS IS M.J.

22:48.768 --> 22:51.771
THE DAY WE BROUGHT HIM HOME FROM
THE HOSPITAL AND STOOD HIM UP.

22:51.771 --> 22:55.805
AND THIS... THIS IS WHERE
I THOUGHT HE'D GET TO.

22:55.805 --> 22:57.807
HERE.

22:57.807 --> 22:59.108
IN THIS HOUSE...

23:02.812 --> 23:06.486
AND NOW I'M NEVER GONNA KNOW,
AND IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.

23:08.718 --> 23:10.860
(crying)

23:10.860 --> 23:15.625
(sighs) THERE IT IS.

23:15.625 --> 23:18.127
HEY.

23:18.127 --> 23:20.129
WE'RE GONNA GET IT BACK.

23:20.129 --> 23:21.671
(sniffles)

23:25.134 --> 23:26.836
I PROMISE.

23:29.178 --> 23:31.611
AND IN THE MEANTIME...
 (clank)

23:36.185 --> 23:37.887
(gasps)

23:37.887 --> 23:42.452
(laughs)

23:48.598 --> 23:49.999
(slurping)

23:49.999 --> 23:52.602
WELL... THAT'S DONE.

23:52.602 --> 23:54.834
IT'S SAM'S COMPANY NOW.

23:54.834 --> 23:56.165
SO YOU DID IT.

23:56.165 --> 24:00.470
YOU ACTUALLY GAVE UP A BUSINESS
YOU SPENT EIGHT YEARS BUILDING.

24:00.470 --> 24:02.472
WHAT OTHER CHOICE
DID I HAVE?

24:02.472 --> 24:04.474
I CAN ALWAYS START
A NEW COMPANY.

24:04.474 --> 24:08.678
WHAT I CANNOT DO
IS SEND MY SON TO JAIL.

24:08.678 --> 24:11.681
YOU SENT ME TO JAIL.

24:11.681 --> 24:13.683
YOU INSISTED I TURN MYSELF IN.

24:13.683 --> 24:16.856
YOU SAID IT WAS THE ONLY WAY
YOU'D TAKE ME BACK.

24:16.856 --> 24:20.189
THAT WAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
SITUATION.

24:20.189 --> 24:21.160
(cup clatters)

24:21.160 --> 24:23.533
REALLY?

24:23.533 --> 24:25.535
I RAN OVER MIKE
AND TOLD NO ONE.

24:25.535 --> 24:28.037
ANDREW RAN OVER CARLOS' MOTHER
AND TOLD NO ONE.

24:28.037 --> 24:29.639
HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT?

24:29.639 --> 24:33.142
ANDREW WAS A CHILD
AT THE TIME.

24:33.142 --> 24:34.844
HE'S NOT ANYMORE.

24:34.844 --> 24:37.476
ORSON, PLEASE.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.478
I DON'T MEAN TO UPSET YOU.

24:39.478 --> 24:40.980
I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY

24:40.980 --> 24:43.983
YOU'RE NOT DEMANDING ANDREW
DO THE SAME THING AS WELL.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.484
FINE. I WAS WRONG.

24:45.484 --> 24:48.217
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE ASKED YOU
TO MAKE THAT SACRIFICE.

24:48.217 --> 24:50.219
I DON'T WANT AN APOLOGY.

24:50.219 --> 24:55.825
I RESPECTED YOU FOR
DEMANDING BETTER OF ME.

24:55.825 --> 24:58.668
YOU SHOWED ME YOU HAD
PRINCIPLES AND IDEALS.

24:58.668 --> 25:01.170
YOU INSISTED
I LIVE UP TO YOUR STANDARDS,

25:01.170 --> 25:03.673
AND I LOVED YOU FOR IT.

25:03.673 --> 25:05.905
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

25:05.905 --> 25:08.908
FROM THE MOMENT YOU TOLD ME
WHAT ANDREW HAD DONE

25:08.908 --> 25:12.111
AND WHAT SAM WAS THREATENING
TO DO, I SAW THIS AS A TEST,

25:12.111 --> 25:15.114
AND I HOPED WORTH ALL MY HEART
THAT YOU WOULD PASS IT,

25:15.114 --> 25:17.116
BUT YOU HAVE FAILED
MISERABLY.

25:17.116 --> 25:18.618
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

25:18.618 --> 25:21.190
PACK MY SUITCASE.
I'M LEAVING.

25:21.190 --> 25:22.291
WHAT?

25:22.291 --> 25:25.625
YOU ARE NOT THE WOMAN
I THOUGHT YOU WERE.

25:28.257 --> 25:31.000
FOR GOD SAKES, ORSON.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.903
HE'S MY SON.
I HAVE NO CHOICE.

25:33.903 --> 25:37.006
WE ALWAYS HAVE A CHOICE,

25:37.006 --> 25:40.539
AND I NO LONGER CHOOSE
TO BE YOUR HUSBAND.

25:49.619 --> 25:51.621
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GONNA GO AROUND BACK,

25:51.621 --> 25:53.623
SEE IF I CAN CLIMB
IN A WINDOW.

25:53.623 --> 25:56.586
YOU THINK YOU CAN KEEP PATRICK
OCCUPIED FOR TEN MINUTES?

25:56.586 --> 25:58.688
HONEY,
YOU'RE TALKING TO A WOMAN

25:58.688 --> 26:01.691
WHO NEVER PAID FOR A DRINK
IN HER LIFE. PLEASE.

26:01.691 --> 26:03.963
OH, MAN.

26:03.963 --> 26:05.164
YOU OKAY?

26:05.164 --> 26:07.997
(groans) YEAH.
JUST A LITTLE LIGHT-HEADED.

26:07.997 --> 26:09.999
JUST GIVE ME A SECOND.

26:11.871 --> 26:13.873
BY THE WAY, THANK YOU.

26:13.873 --> 26:16.646
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
HELPING US OUT LIKE THIS.

26:16.646 --> 26:18.648
I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS IT'S...

26:18.648 --> 26:21.110
I GUESS IT'S BECAUSE
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE

26:21.110 --> 26:22.612
TO HAVE SECRETS, TOO.

26:22.612 --> 26:25.715
IT'S A LONELY FEELING.

26:25.715 --> 26:30.119
AND THAT NIGHT ON THE PLANE
WHEN ANGIE TOLD ME HERS,

26:30.119 --> 26:32.692
I PROMISED
I WOULD HELP HER...

26:32.692 --> 26:34.994
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

26:38.968 --> 26:41.030
NICK? NICK.

26:41.030 --> 26:43.032
OH, MY GOD.
DON'T PASS OUT.

26:43.032 --> 26:44.303
NICK!

26:44.303 --> 26:47.206
COME ON!
I CAN'T DO THIS ALONE.

26:52.812 --> 26:55.284
SHE'S SO SMALL.

26:55.284 --> 26:59.248
NOT FOR LONG.
THEY GROW UP SO QUICKLY.

26:59.248 --> 27:01.851
I WISH I COULD SEE HER
GROW UP.

27:07.256 --> 27:10.700
SO...
I'M GONNA GO NOW.

27:10.700 --> 27:13.162
IF YOU COULD JUST...

27:13.162 --> 27:17.937
WAIT A WHILE BEFORE
YOU CALL THE POLICE.

27:17.937 --> 27:20.139
(zips bag)

27:22.742 --> 27:24.774
WAIT.

27:26.776 --> 27:28.778
THAT DAY YOU LEFT MY HOUSE,

27:28.778 --> 27:31.781
YOU TOLD ME YOUR LIFE
WOULD HAVE TURNED OUT DIFFERENT

27:31.781 --> 27:33.953
IF I HAD BEEN YOUR MOM.

27:33.953 --> 27:37.286
SO I'M GONNA BE
YOUR MOM... NOW.

27:37.286 --> 27:39.288
WILL YOU LISTEN TO ME?

27:42.191 --> 27:44.193
I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD LEAVE.

27:44.193 --> 27:48.137
I THINK YOU SHOULD STAY HERE
AND CALL THE POLICE.

27:48.137 --> 27:50.399
I CAN'T.

27:50.399 --> 27:52.802
YES, YOU CAN.

27:52.802 --> 27:55.404
I DON'T WANT TO SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE IN JAIL.

27:55.404 --> 28:00.880
HONEY... DON'T YOU SEE
YOU'RE ALREADY THERE?

28:00.880 --> 28:03.382
NO MATTER WHERE YOU RUN TO,
IN YOUR HEAD,

28:03.382 --> 28:06.756
YOU WILL STILL BE ANGRY.

28:06.756 --> 28:09.458
YOU'LL STILL BE IN PAIN.

28:09.458 --> 28:12.421
AND AS LONG AS YOU WANT
TO KEEP HURTING PEOPLE,

28:12.421 --> 28:14.423
YOU WILL NEVER BE FREE.

28:14.423 --> 28:17.266
I'LL BE GOOD. I SWEAR.

28:17.266 --> 28:20.229
BUT PEOPLE WILL NEVER SEE
THAT YOU'RE GOOD

28:20.229 --> 28:23.272
UNLESS YOU SHOW THEM.

28:23.272 --> 28:27.937
PLEASE, IF YOU PICK UP
THE PHONE, THEY WILL KNOW.

28:27.937 --> 28:31.280
AND I WILL BE SO PROUD
OF YOU.

28:39.819 --> 28:42.221
(door closes)

28:42.221 --> 28:43.392
(sniffles)

28:51.360 --> 28:53.362
(voice breaking)
WILL YOU CALL THEM FOR ME?

28:53.362 --> 28:56.335
OF COURSE.

29:04.013 --> 29:06.816
(baby fussing)

29:10.249 --> 29:12.521
WHY DON'T YOU HOLD
THE BABY?

29:20.329 --> 29:22.832
(chuckles)

29:27.366 --> 29:32.241
(beeping)

29:32.241 --> 29:33.542
(phone ringing)

29:41.510 --> 29:43.212
HELLO. FAIRVIEW HOSPITAL?

29:43.212 --> 29:46.285
I NEED TO KNOW HOW TO BRING
SOMEONE OUT OF A COMA.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.287
I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S A COMA.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.289
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
A COMA AND A NAP.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.291
HOW SHOULD I KNOW
IF HE'S CLAMMY?

29:52.291 --> 29:55.264
I LEFT HIM IN THE CAR.
 (knock on door)

29:55.264 --> 29:57.126
GABY?

29:57.126 --> 29:59.098
HEY, SUSAN, WHAT'S UP?

29:59.098 --> 30:01.400
JUST CAME TO SAY GOOD-BYE.
 OKAY. ALL RIGHT. SEE YA.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.372
OH, NO.
I MEAN, THIS IS IT.

30:03.372 --> 30:05.374
TOMORROW'S MOVING DAY,
AND IT'S GONNA BE CRAZY,

30:05.374 --> 30:07.376
SO I DIDN'T WANT TO RUSH
THROUGH OUR GOOD-BYES.

30:07.376 --> 30:11.010
OH, GOOD FOR YOU.
I'LL CATCH YA WHEN I CATCH YA.

30:12.441 --> 30:16.485
HELLO? HELLO? DAMN IT!
 (beep)

30:16.485 --> 30:20.089
(sighs)

30:20.089 --> 30:22.922
OH! SUSAN! UH...

30:22.922 --> 30:25.925
I'M SORRY. I'M JUST
SO CHOKED UP ABOUT YOU LEAVING.

30:25.925 --> 30:28.898
I JUST COULDN'T DEAL WITH IT.
 OH!

30:28.898 --> 30:29.999
REALLY?

30:29.999 --> 30:31.430
(chuckles)

30:31.430 --> 30:34.403
YOU KNOW WHO ELSE IS
GONNA BE DEVASTATED? ANGIE.

30:34.403 --> 30:36.265
ANGIE BOLEN?

30:36.265 --> 30:38.267
YES. SHE'S TOTALLY BROKEN UP
ABOUT THIS.

30:38.267 --> 30:40.409
YOU'VE GOTTA SAY GOOD-BYE.

30:40.409 --> 30:42.912
SERIOUSLY? I-I MEAN, I LIKE HER
AND EVERYTHING.

30:42.912 --> 30:44.914
I JUST...
WE'VE HAD OUR PROBLEMS.

30:44.914 --> 30:46.375
OH, JUST NEIGHBOR STUFF.

30:46.375 --> 30:49.378
WELL, I TRIED TO CRUSH
HER SON WITH HIS CAR.

30:49.378 --> 30:51.380
ONE OF
HER FAVORITE STORIES.

30:51.380 --> 30:53.382
AND THEN SHE ATTACKED ME
WITH A BAT.

30:53.382 --> 30:57.056
SHE'S ITALIAN. THAT'S LOVE.
NOW COME ON.

30:57.056 --> 30:59.058
YOU KNOW,
ANGIE ONCE TOLD ME

30:59.058 --> 31:01.060
THAT A GOOD-BYE
DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING

31:01.060 --> 31:03.062
IF IT DOESN'T LAST
TEN MINUTES.

31:03.062 --> 31:05.594
REALLY? I DON'T THINK
ANGIE AND I HAVE EVER HAD

31:05.594 --> 31:07.866
A CONVERSATION
THAT LASTED MORE THAN...

31:07.866 --> 31:09.939
GABY?

31:13.402 --> 31:16.145
OKAY. UH...

31:18.377 --> 31:21.110
IT'S GETTING LATE. LET'S GO.

31:21.110 --> 31:23.412
YEAH, THESE AREN'T
GONNA DRAW ANY ATTENTION.

31:23.412 --> 31:27.416
NOT AS MUCH AS A BULLET
IN THE HEAD IF YOU TRY TO RUN.

31:27.416 --> 31:30.489
(doorbell rings)

31:36.495 --> 31:39.328
IT'S MY NEIGHBOR, SUSAN.

31:39.328 --> 31:42.331
SOMEONE REALLY NEEDS
TO THIN THIS HERD.

31:42.331 --> 31:44.033
GET RID OF HER.

31:44.033 --> 31:47.436
SUSAN. WHAT'S GOING ON?

31:47.436 --> 31:49.138
UH...
T-TOMORROW'S MOVING DAY.

31:49.138 --> 31:52.011
I JUST CAME
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

31:52.011 --> 31:56.445
OKAY... BYE.

31:59.418 --> 32:01.350
DON'T YOU WANT
MY NEW ADDRESS?

32:03.322 --> 32:07.456
RELAX, ANGE. THIS WILL BE
OVER BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

32:10.459 --> 32:12.501
(grunting)
 (lowered voice)
IT'S OKAY, DANNY.

32:12.501 --> 32:14.503
I'M GONNA GET YOU
OUT OF HERE.

32:14.503 --> 32:16.405
OH! (grunts)

32:29.578 --> 32:33.322
(shifts gears, turns off engine)

32:33.322 --> 32:34.723
WHY ARE WE STOPPING?

32:34.723 --> 32:38.287
WHAT'S THE RANGE ON THIS THING?
ABOUT 200 YARDS?

32:38.287 --> 32:40.990
YEAH. WHY?

32:48.437 --> 32:50.339
(groans)

32:51.700 --> 32:54.103
PATRICK, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

32:54.103 --> 32:58.647
WHEN I WOKE UP THAT MORNING
20 YEARS AGO,

32:58.647 --> 33:01.510
AND YOU WERE GONE,

33:01.510 --> 33:04.013
I WAS DEVASTATED.

33:04.013 --> 33:06.615
I TRIED TO FORGIVE YOU,
BUT I COULDN'T.

33:06.615 --> 33:08.617
AFTER ALL, YOU DIDN'T JUST
BETRAY ME.

33:08.617 --> 33:12.361
YOU BETRAYED EVERYTHING
WE BELIEVED IN.

33:12.361 --> 33:16.995
SO I DECIDED ONE DAY

33:16.995 --> 33:19.398
I WOULD FIND YOU...

33:19.398 --> 33:21.500
AND I WOULD PUNISH YOU.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.673
AND TODAY IS THAT DAY,
MY LOVE.

33:24.673 --> 33:27.376
WHERE'S THE BOMB?

33:30.139 --> 33:34.012
THERE'S 30 SECONDS FROM
THE TIME I PUSH THIS DETONATOR

33:34.012 --> 33:36.515
TILL THE EXPLOSION--
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID, RIGHT?

33:36.515 --> 33:39.388
TELL ME WHERE THE BOMB IS NOW!
 IT'S IN YOUR HOUSE.

33:39.388 --> 33:41.450
AND IF YOU WANT TO SAVE
OUR SON,

33:41.450 --> 33:44.253
I SUGGEST YOU GET MOVING.
 (beep)

33:51.200 --> 33:52.361
(beeping)

33:52.361 --> 33:55.464
COME ON. HURRY.
I GOTTA HELP MY MOM.
 I'M TRYING!

33:57.066 --> 33:58.407
OKAY.

34:09.078 --> 34:11.280
(singsongy)
IT'S IN THE DETONATOR.

34:12.551 --> 34:15.583
YOU BITCH.

34:15.583 --> 34:17.286
(beep)

34:20.259 --> 34:22.231
(gasps)
 MOM?

34:46.385 --> 34:49.118
(man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

34:49.118 --> 34:51.560
OH, GABY. WE CAN'T TAKE THIS.
THIS IS TOO MUCH.

34:51.560 --> 34:53.562
I INSIST.

34:53.562 --> 34:56.525
ALTHOUGH I AM GONNA NEED
$10 FOR PARKING.

34:59.428 --> 35:02.471
SO... THIS IS GOOD-BYE.

35:02.471 --> 35:03.672
FOREVER, RIGHT?

35:03.672 --> 35:06.104
I MEAN,
THAT'S HOW THIS WORKS?

35:06.104 --> 35:07.606
YEAH.

35:09.508 --> 35:11.610
(scoffs)
YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY?

35:11.610 --> 35:14.313
NICK HAD TO DRAG ME HERE
KICKING AND SCREAMING.

35:16.485 --> 35:19.488
HE TOLD ME IT WOULD BE
A GOOD PLACE TO BLEND IN

35:19.488 --> 35:21.490
BECAUSE PEOPLE WAVE AT YOU

35:21.490 --> 35:23.492
FROM BEHIND
THEIR LITTLE PICKET FENCES,

35:23.492 --> 35:28.397
BUT THEY WOULD NEVER
GET INVOLVED. THEY DON'T CARE.

35:28.397 --> 35:31.500
WELL, THANK GOD
YOU PROVED HIM WRONG.

35:34.733 --> 35:36.405
TAKE CARE.

35:46.545 --> 35:49.748
SO WE BETTER HURRY.
BUS IS LEAVING IN FIVE MINUTES.

35:49.748 --> 35:53.752
YEAH. WE SHOULD GIVE HIM
HIS TICKET.

35:58.757 --> 36:00.789
THIS IS A TICKET
TO NEW YORK.

36:00.789 --> 36:03.492
I THOUGHT THE PLAN
WAS TO GO TO ATLANTA.

36:03.492 --> 36:05.694
THAT'S OUR PLAN.

36:08.397 --> 36:10.399
NO WAY.
 LISTEN TO ME.

36:10.399 --> 36:12.701
I WANT TO BE WITH YOU GUYS.

36:12.701 --> 36:14.703
AND WE WANNA BE WITH YOU,

36:14.703 --> 36:16.705
BUT WE HAVE TO STOP
BEING SELFISH.

36:16.705 --> 36:19.348
SHE'S RIGHT. IT'S TIME
WE LET YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE.

36:19.348 --> 36:22.311
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE SO MUCH FUN
IN NEW YORK.

36:22.311 --> 36:24.953
WE GET TO BE WITH ANA.
YOU CAN SEE GRANDMA.

36:24.953 --> 36:27.456
AND YOU CAN FINALLY STOP
RUNNING.

36:27.456 --> 36:30.889
BUT I'LL STILL GET TO SEE
YOU GUYS EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

36:32.921 --> 36:35.424
RIGHT?
I MEAN, PATRICK'S DEAD.

36:35.424 --> 36:37.626
THE FBI IS STILL
LOOKING FOR US.

36:37.626 --> 36:40.629
I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THIS.
I'M NOT READY FOR--

36:40.629 --> 36:43.502
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

36:43.502 --> 36:46.975
YOU ARE GONNA BE FINE, OKAY?

36:46.975 --> 36:48.937
BECAUSE YOU...

36:48.937 --> 36:52.441
YOU HAVE TURNED
INTO ONE HELL OF A MAN.

36:52.441 --> 36:55.314
(chuckles) YEAH.

36:56.985 --> 36:58.487
IF I AM...

37:00.519 --> 37:02.451
IT'S 'CAUSE YOU WERE
MY FATHER.

37:39.858 --> 37:41.830
(door opens)

37:41.830 --> 37:44.533
(door closes)

37:44.533 --> 37:45.794
MOM?

37:49.037 --> 37:51.470
WHY IS ALL
OF ORSON'S STUFF GONE?

37:55.444 --> 37:58.447
HE LEFT ME.

37:58.447 --> 38:01.310
WHAT? WHY?

38:01.310 --> 38:03.482
HE FEELS I'M A HYPOCRITE.

38:03.482 --> 38:05.954
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

38:05.954 --> 38:09.458
NO. HE'S RIGHT. I AM.

38:09.458 --> 38:12.761
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO?

38:12.761 --> 38:14.923
THERE IS.

38:17.966 --> 38:20.469
YOU CAN GIVE ME YOUR PERMISSION
TO DO SOMETHING

38:20.469 --> 38:23.572
I SHOULD HAVE DONE
A LONG TIME AGO.

38:26.505 --> 38:28.477
(telephone ringing in distance)

38:28.477 --> 38:30.779
THIS IS BAD.

38:30.779 --> 38:32.981
WHAT IF WE DON'T
SAY ANYTHING?

38:32.981 --> 38:34.943
THE NURSE IS DEAD.
NOBODY ELSE KNOWS.

38:34.943 --> 38:36.915
THE PRIEST KNOWS.

38:36.915 --> 38:39.818
I DON'T SUPPOSE
WE COULD BUY HIM OFF.

38:39.818 --> 38:41.950
JUST A SUGGESTION.

38:41.950 --> 38:44.953
IF THIS LEADS TO A LAWSUIT,
WE HAVE NO DEFENSE.

38:44.953 --> 38:46.955
THIS COULD
RUIN THE HOSPITAL.

38:46.955 --> 38:50.429
JACK, WHAT'S WRONG?

38:50.429 --> 38:52.431
I KNOW ONE OF THESE FAMILIES.

38:52.431 --> 38:56.765
THEY LIVE TWO BLOCKS FROM ME
ON WISTERIA LANE.

38:56.765 --> 38:59.838
THEN MAYBE YOU'RE
THE BEST PERSON TO TELL THEM.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.840
AND HOW DO I DO THAT?

39:01.840 --> 39:05.944
(sighs) HOW DO YOU TELL PARENTS
THE CHILD THEY'VE BEEN RAISING--

39:05.944 --> 39:10.649
THE CHILD THEY LOVE--
ISN'T REALLY THEIRS?

39:16.555 --> 39:20.589
HEY THERE. WHAT'S GOING ON?
 SUSAN TRYING TO SNEAK OFF
WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE.

39:20.589 --> 39:22.591
THE MORE I THOUGHT ABOUT IT,

39:22.591 --> 39:24.893
THE MORE I REALIZED
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

39:24.893 --> 39:26.895
I'M JUST MOVING ACROSS TOWN.

39:26.895 --> 39:28.897
I'M GONNA SEE YOU ALL FRIDAY
FOR POKER.

39:28.897 --> 39:31.900
YOU BETTER, 'CAUSE IF WE DON'T
HEAR FROM YOU ONCE A WEEK,

39:31.900 --> 39:34.873
WE WILL HUNT YOU DOWN AND BRING
YOU BACK. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?
 I DO.

39:34.873 --> 39:37.105
SO WHO'S RENTING YOUR HOUSE?

39:37.105 --> 39:39.578
LEE FOUND A GUY.

39:39.578 --> 39:43.011
IT'S JUST NOT GONNA SEEM RIGHT,
SOMEONE ELSE IN YOUR HOUSE.

39:43.011 --> 39:45.013
YEAH. WELL, WHOEVER THE GUY IS,

39:45.013 --> 39:48.687
HE IS VERY LUCKY, 'CAUSE HE'S
ABOUT TO GET HIMSELF

39:48.687 --> 39:50.689
THREE OF
THE MOST WONDERFUL NEIGHBORS

39:50.689 --> 39:52.691
A PERSON COULD ASK FOR.

39:56.665 --> 39:59.167
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
WHEN YOU SEE PEOPLE EVERY DAY,

39:59.167 --> 40:02.170
YOU FORGET TO TELL THEM
HOW MUCH THEY MEAN TO YOU.

40:02.170 --> 40:04.102
SO FOR THE RECORD...

40:04.102 --> 40:07.175
I THINK THE THREE OF YOU
ARE SUCH GOOD PEOPLE.

40:08.777 --> 40:11.480
AND YOU'VE MADE ME
A BETTER PERSON,

40:11.480 --> 40:15.183
AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT.
 (chuckles)

40:15.183 --> 40:18.947
HEY, SUSAN, I HATE TO INTERRUPT,
BUT WE REALLY GOTTA GET GOING.

40:18.947 --> 40:21.650
I SHOULD GO CHECK ON TOM
AND THE BABY.

40:21.650 --> 40:23.722
I'M SURE ONE OR BOTH
WILL NEED TO BE FED.
 GO, GO.

40:23.722 --> 40:27.726
I'LL CALL YOU ALL
IN THE MORNING.
 OKAY. (chuckles)

40:29.598 --> 40:31.199
HONEY, WHAT'S WRONG?

40:32.701 --> 40:35.534
WHAT SUSAN SAID...

40:35.534 --> 40:38.436
IT'S NOT TRUE.
I'M NOT A GOOD PERSON.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.669
OH, THAT'S SILLY.
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

40:40.669 --> 40:43.672
NO, I'M NOT. THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU

40:43.672 --> 40:47.616
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU YEARS AGO
BUT I DIDN'T.

40:47.616 --> 40:51.550
YOU SOUND SO SERIOUS.
WHAT IS IT?

40:51.550 --> 40:55.023
IT'S THE KIND OF THING
THAT COULD END OUR FRIENDSHIP.

40:56.855 --> 40:58.657
CAN WE GO TALK?

41:08.737 --> 41:10.238
(seat belt clicks)

41:10.238 --> 41:13.201
WELL... YOU READY?

41:13.201 --> 41:15.874
YEAH.

41:15.874 --> 41:17.976
DRIVE AWAY SLOW, OKAY?

41:19.878 --> 41:22.050
(starts engine)

41:22.050 --> 41:23.582
(shifts gears)

41:25.814 --> 41:30.088
AS THEY PULLED AWAY,

41:30.088 --> 41:35.093
SUSAN LOOKED OUT ON THE STREET
SHE LOVED SO MUCH--

41:35.093 --> 41:39.898
A STREET WHERE PARENTS
COULD RAISE THEIR CHILDREN...

41:41.499 --> 41:45.634
WHERE RETIREES COULD ENJOY
THEIR GOLDEN YEARS...

41:45.634 --> 41:47.676
WHERE GOOD FRIENDS

41:47.676 --> 41:52.510
COULD SHARE HORRIBLE SECRETS...

41:52.510 --> 41:55.884
YES,
SUSAN LOOKED ON THIS STREET

41:55.884 --> 42:00.188
AND VOWED SHE WOULD BE BACK...

42:00.188 --> 42:03.021
BUT AS SHE DID SO,

42:03.021 --> 42:06.625
SHE DIDN'T NOTICE
THE CAR THAT PASSED HER...

42:08.657 --> 42:12.130
A CAR
CARRYING WISTERIA LANE'S...

42:12.130 --> 42:17.265
NEWEST RESIDENT.

42:17.265 --> 42:20.268
SO I HAVE SOME PAPERWORK
FOR YOU TO SIGN OVER HERE,

42:20.268 --> 42:24.873
AND ONCE WE GET THIS DONE,
I CAN GIVE YOU THE KEYS.

42:24.873 --> 42:27.876
AND I JUST KNOW YOU'RE
REALLY GONNA LIKE IT HERE.

42:27.876 --> 42:30.749
PEOPLE ARE FRIENDLY,
RELATIVELY QUIET.

42:30.749 --> 42:33.722
IT'S JUST... IT'S JUST
A LOVELY NEIGHBORHOOD.

42:33.722 --> 42:37.756
OH, I KNOW THE NEIGHBORHOOD
VERY WELL.

42:37.756 --> 42:40.558
THE TRUTH IS,
I USED TO LIVE HERE.

42:40.558 --> 42:42.560
OH, WELL, THEN I GUESS

42:42.560 --> 42:45.664
EVERYONE WILL BE SURPRISED
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

42:45.664 --> 42:48.136
THEY ABSOLUTELY WILL.
