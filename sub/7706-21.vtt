WEBVTT

00:01.268 --> 00:02.501
(ALF)
Four, five..

00:02.503 --> 00:07.373
If line 65 is larger
than line 34, deduct from line--

00:07.375 --> 00:08.841
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

00:08.843 --> 00:12.378
I'm doing Willie's taxes
and eating his dinner.

00:12.380 --> 00:15.881
Oh...leave that alone.

00:15.883 --> 00:18.684
Uff, what do you know
about taxes?

00:18.686 --> 00:23.389
I'm an expert on travel,
entertainment and depreciation.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.391
You mean destruction.

00:25.393 --> 00:28.627
No, destruction goes
under entertainment.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.398
Hi, everybody.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.565
- Hi, dad.
- Hi.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.901
Willie, how did your meeting go?

00:35.903 --> 00:39.571
And more importantly, what are
your projected capital gains

00:39.573 --> 00:42.808
for the fourth quarter,
if any?

00:42.810 --> 00:46.345
Strangely enough, ALF,
I will be enjoying

00:46.347 --> 00:47.813
a modest increase in income

00:47.815 --> 00:51.050
because I've just been promoted
to district supervisor.

00:51.052 --> 00:52.351
- Oh!
- 'That's great.'

00:52.353 --> 00:54.753
Congratulations.
You got it.

00:54.755 --> 00:57.423
So you're gonna be supervisor
for all of Los Angeles?

00:57.425 --> 01:03.362
Well, not exactly
all of Los Angeles.

01:03.364 --> 01:06.665
- Fullerton?
- No.

01:06.667 --> 01:09.601
- Anaheim?
- No.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.603
Well, are you gonna
tell us where it is

01:11.605 --> 01:14.406
or should we get a map
and throw darts?

01:15.576 --> 01:20.679
Actually, I'm supervisor
for all of San Diego.

01:22.783 --> 01:25.417
So you mean
we're gonna have to move?

01:25.419 --> 01:27.352
Well, it kinda looks like it.

01:27.354 --> 01:31.523
We can't move.
I've put down roots here.

01:31.525 --> 01:33.759
You know, this year is
my last year of high school.

01:35.429 --> 01:38.263
You don't wanna move either,
do you, ALF?

01:38.265 --> 01:39.798
I'm ambivalent.

01:39.800 --> 01:43.035
On one hand I could use
the change of scenery.

01:43.037 --> 01:47.606
On the other hand
I'm terrified of Shamu.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.942
Hey, Lynn, we're not gonna move

01:49.944 --> 01:52.478
until after the end of the
school year.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.713
In the meantime, I'll commute.

01:54.715 --> 01:57.916
You are gonna taking me
when you move, right?

01:57.918 --> 02:01.553
Well, we might if you stop
eating Willie's dinner.

02:03.057 --> 02:06.458
Oh, immediate gratification

02:06.460 --> 02:08.727
versus long term security.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.664
I'm thinking,
I'm thinking.

02:14.268 --> 02:15.834
[theme music]

02:38.092 --> 02:40.692
[music continues]

03:16.463 --> 03:17.696
[instrumental music]

03:21.402 --> 03:23.168
[yawns]

03:23.170 --> 03:24.570
Morning, Bri.

03:24.572 --> 03:26.572
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:28.576 --> 03:30.409
I know it's early
but I'm sure

03:30.411 --> 03:32.978
your dad will appreciate
you seeing him off.

03:32.980 --> 03:35.380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.583
You know when you were a baby
you used to wake us up

03:37.585 --> 03:39.184
at 6:00 a.m.

03:39.186 --> 03:41.753
Boy, you really carry a grudge.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.058
- Good morning.
- Hi, honey.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.360
I thought you were gonna do
the 30 minute workout.

03:48.362 --> 03:50.495
I was,
but I turned off the TV

03:50.497 --> 03:52.931
when I heard
that perky little voice yell

03:52.933 --> 03:55.667
"Come on, gang,
let's jazzercise."

03:56.904 --> 04:00.272
¶ San Diego here I come ¶

04:00.274 --> 04:04.109
¶ Melmac's where
I started from ¶¶

04:04.111 --> 04:06.411
I told you, ALF,
we're not moving yet.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.779
But..

04:07.781 --> 04:12.918
¶ All my bags are packed
I'm ready to go ¶¶

04:12.920 --> 04:16.421
- Would you like some breakfast?
- What do you think?

04:16.423 --> 04:18.223
I'll be having
the bacon and eggs

04:18.225 --> 04:21.460
and sausage and ham,
and liver and onions

04:21.462 --> 04:23.528
and chicken pot pie.

04:24.632 --> 04:27.232
- We're having oatmeal.
- Even better.

04:27.234 --> 04:30.135
My cholesterol must be
in the millions.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.970
- Good morning, dad.
- Hi, honey.

04:31.972 --> 04:35.741
Hey, you guys didn't have to all
get up for me this morning.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.776
That's not what mom said.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.378
[Willie chuckles]

04:39.380 --> 04:43.949
Hey, boss man, ready for
your first day as head honcho?

04:43.951 --> 04:47.486
The big cheese.
Mr. Dithers.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.921
Big cheese will be fine.

04:49.923 --> 04:54.559
Speaking of cheese, Kate,
throw a slab on my oatmeal.

04:54.561 --> 04:55.961
Honey, would you like
some breakfast?

04:55.963 --> 04:58.297
Uh, no, I'll-I'll just
have this cinnamon roll.

04:58.299 --> 05:00.032
Sorry, we're out.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.641
- We got a present for you, dad.
- For me?

05:09.643 --> 05:13.845
Oh! How thoughtful,
you guys.

05:13.847 --> 05:18.183
Oh, look at this.
Classic books on tape.

05:18.185 --> 05:21.620
"'Crime and Punishment,'
'Madame Bovary'

05:21.622 --> 05:23.855
'Twisted Sister.'"

05:23.857 --> 05:27.025
Well, if you don't like
that one, I'll take it.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.593
[knock on door]

05:28.595 --> 05:31.697
- 'Hey, Tanners.'
- ALF, it's Trevor.

05:31.699 --> 05:33.999
When does this man sleep?

05:39.206 --> 05:40.939
Trevor!

05:42.810 --> 05:44.643
- Hi.
- Hi, Kate.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.545
What are you doing up so early?

05:46.547 --> 05:48.880
I never miss 30 minute workout.

05:48.882 --> 05:51.717
- You work out?
- I watch.

05:51.719 --> 05:54.619
I like that one instructor
on the left, Muffy

05:54.621 --> 05:56.855
the low-impact one.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.791
Hey, who's the extra
oatmeal for?

06:01.228 --> 06:03.362
- Uh..
- You.

06:03.364 --> 06:06.798
Yeah, Trevor, we were hoping
you'd come over.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.900
Great. I should drop
by more often.

06:08.902 --> 06:13.372
Why...did...you drop by?

06:14.408 --> 06:16.241
Oh, yeah, I wanted to wish you

06:16.243 --> 06:17.743
good luck on the new job.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.544
And to see why
you haven't left yet.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.713
That drive down to San Diego
is a killer.

06:23.317 --> 06:25.684
Why is there cheese in this?

06:25.686 --> 06:27.652
We like it that way.

06:28.355 --> 06:29.955
Then let's trade.

06:33.494 --> 06:34.926
You're right about that drive.

06:34.928 --> 06:37.028
I-I better get going.

06:37.030 --> 06:39.765
- Bye, dad.
- Don't forget your tapes.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.266
Okay, now, drive carefully,
sweetheart.

06:41.268 --> 06:43.702
- We'll see you tonight.
- Yeah. Goodbye.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.170
Goodbye, everyone.

06:45.172 --> 06:49.908
And, uh, say goodbye to...anyone
else who might miss me.

06:49.910 --> 06:53.278
- We will.
- uh, good luck, Tanner.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.946
Um.. Oh.

07:09.396 --> 07:12.030
[instrumental music]

07:17.204 --> 07:18.403
[sighs]

07:18.405 --> 07:22.574
I don't believe
you are eating crackers in bed.

07:22.576 --> 07:26.244
I know.
It's such a cliche.

07:26.246 --> 07:29.848
Could you be a dear and hoover
the crumbs out of my fur?

07:31.785 --> 07:35.387
I want every single crumb
out of this bed.

07:35.389 --> 07:37.222
Including you.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.490
Kate, Kate.

07:38.492 --> 07:40.492
I know you're upset about Willie

07:40.494 --> 07:42.327
but he'll be home soon

07:42.329 --> 07:45.397
and I won't leave this bed
till he is.

07:46.633 --> 07:49.000
- Hi.
- Rats.

07:50.337 --> 07:53.238
Just what I wanted
to see in my bed.

07:54.274 --> 07:56.408
Thanks. Cracker?

07:58.979 --> 08:02.347
Honey, it's 11 o'clock at night.
What happened?

08:02.349 --> 08:03.849
I'm sorry, Kate.

08:03.851 --> 08:07.185
I-I-I got in a big tie-up
on the..

08:07.187 --> 08:08.587
...on the...

08:08.589 --> 08:11.957
- Freeway.
- Freeway.

08:11.959 --> 08:14.426
I suppose you've discussed
the, uh, crackers in bed.

08:14.428 --> 08:16.928
Yes, well, we were
just beginning a dialogue

08:16.930 --> 08:19.030
on that when you came in.

08:19.032 --> 08:22.367
Yes, your arrival
was most fortuitous.

08:23.637 --> 08:25.270
Not that it matters.

08:25.272 --> 08:29.541
I'm so tired now
I could sleep on broken glass.

08:29.543 --> 08:32.777
Well, then you might wanna sleep
in front of the China cabinet.

08:36.383 --> 08:39.518
I thought it would be
a good time to mention it.

08:39.520 --> 08:43.121
We'll begin a dialogue
on that...later.

08:43.123 --> 08:46.057
Oh, honey, you look exhausted.

08:46.059 --> 08:48.293
Maybe you should get a place
down there during the week.

08:48.295 --> 08:51.730
I can't do that, Kate.
It would cost too much.

08:51.732 --> 08:54.065
Well, get a couple of roommates.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.501
A blond and a brunette.

08:56.503 --> 08:59.738
But remember,
when Mr. Roper comes over

08:59.740 --> 09:01.573
pretend you're gay.

09:05.379 --> 09:07.312
We're just gonna have
to move to San Diego

09:07.314 --> 09:09.314
sooner than we planned,
that's all.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.751
Alright, I'll go pack..

09:12.753 --> 09:14.553
...again.

09:18.258 --> 09:22.894
[sighs]
So I guess we should sell
the house right away.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.663
Maybe with the extra money
I'm making

09:24.665 --> 09:26.331
we can afford a bigger one.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.234
Excuse me

09:29.236 --> 09:32.003
but did anyone find
my cheese spread?

09:37.377 --> 09:39.177
Ooh.

09:39.179 --> 09:40.512
Keep it.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.282
[instrumental music]

09:46.286 --> 09:49.621
Goodbye. And, uh,
thanks for your offer.

09:51.525 --> 09:55.760
I'm not letting anyone turn this
place into a bed and breakfast.

09:55.762 --> 09:58.063
Did someone mention breakfast?

09:58.065 --> 10:00.565
I'll be having the bacon
and eggs and sausage and--

10:00.567 --> 10:03.768
ALF, it's 4 o'clock
in the afternoon.

10:03.770 --> 10:07.706
Ham and liver
and chicken pot pie.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.408
You know I hate the thought of
someone else living here.

10:10.410 --> 10:15.213
I hate the thought that
it's 14 hours till breakfast.

10:15.215 --> 10:18.249
[sighs]
Will you stop thinking about
your stomach?

10:18.251 --> 10:20.952
We're going through
a traumatic experience here.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.955
Hey, hey, hey. I can relate.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.925
This place means a lot
to me too.

10:26.927 --> 10:29.160
The garage I crashed into.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.129
The bathroom I flooded.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.565
The kitchen I blew up.

10:33.567 --> 10:35.066
[sobbing]

10:37.671 --> 10:39.471
Let's sell this dump.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.907
[instrumental music]

10:45.112 --> 10:46.344
[instrumental music]

10:56.990 --> 10:59.157
I'm sorry,
Mrs. Spencer, I-I don't know

10:59.159 --> 11:01.459
what happened to your check.

11:01.461 --> 11:03.528
Yes, I know
you have five children.

11:03.530 --> 11:05.930
[chuckles]
I can hear them from here.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.334
Yeah. I know the check is late.

11:10.370 --> 11:13.271
Yes, I know
how to read a calendar.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.507
It's the tenth.
It's the eleventh.

11:17.611 --> 11:20.712
I-I'll-I'll see that you get
that check, Mrs. Spencer.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.284
[sighs]

11:32.793 --> 11:34.125
[clears throat]

11:34.127 --> 11:36.294
Good morning, sir.

11:36.296 --> 11:39.497
Uh, do you recall,
uh, Mrs. Gladys Spencer?

11:39.499 --> 11:40.865
Spencer?

11:40.867 --> 11:42.801
Spencer? Umm..

11:42.803 --> 11:47.572
You were supposed to have
sent her a check for $482.

11:47.574 --> 11:50.842
Uh, I think I sent it,
I-I remember sending something..

11:50.844 --> 11:52.544
...to-to somebody.

11:54.014 --> 11:56.081
Well, she said she didn't get
that check.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.083
Well, she probably blew it
on lottery tickets

11:58.085 --> 12:00.318
forgot about it.

12:00.320 --> 12:03.321
But just in case she didn't

12:03.323 --> 12:05.056
would you mind checking to see

12:05.058 --> 12:06.725
if you have any record
of that check?

12:06.727 --> 12:08.727
Sir, I'll get right on it.

12:12.699 --> 12:15.600
When?

12:15.602 --> 12:18.002
When what?

12:18.004 --> 12:22.107
When are you going to
get right on it?

12:22.109 --> 12:27.946
Well, uh, I was thinking
...after lunch.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.380
How about now?

12:29.382 --> 12:32.617
- I'm not hungry yet.
- Get up!

12:32.619 --> 12:35.620
Gee, whatever happened
to please?

12:39.559 --> 12:41.693
Mr. Tanner, did you sign
those requisitions forms?

12:41.695 --> 12:43.461
- Oh!
- They have to go out by 1:00.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.964
I'll get right on..
I'll do that now.

12:45.966 --> 12:48.867
And payroll is still waiting
for last week's time sheets.

12:48.869 --> 12:51.402
Uh, I'll-I'll do that now.

12:51.404 --> 12:54.239
And, sir, I still don't
have a parking space.

12:54.241 --> 12:56.975
Oh, sorry, Denise,
I'll do that now.

12:56.977 --> 12:59.477
Okay, and your son
is on line two.

12:59.479 --> 13:02.647
Sure, no problem, Denise.
I've got 12 hands.

13:04.284 --> 13:07.585
- Hi, Brian
- 'Hi, daddy!'

13:07.587 --> 13:10.321
- ALF, I'm very busy.
- What are you doing?

13:10.323 --> 13:12.590
I'm assigning parking spaces.

13:12.592 --> 13:15.093
I thought
you were a social worker.

13:15.095 --> 13:20.165
I am but at the moment...
I'm assigning parking spaces.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.566
What do you want?

13:21.568 --> 13:24.269
Two more couple
saw the house today.

13:24.271 --> 13:27.472
Really. Did any of the couples
make an offer?

13:27.474 --> 13:29.674
Nothing worth considering.

13:32.646 --> 13:35.446
I'm very busy, ALF.
I can't talk now.

13:35.448 --> 13:39.217
Put me on hold.
I'll listen to the muzak.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.487
Goodbye, ALF.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.766
Later, babe.

13:57.637 --> 14:01.806
I found the, uh, Spencer check.
It was in the Wilcox file.

14:01.808 --> 14:06.211
Wilcox, Wilcox.
Yeah, that name sounds familiar.

14:08.281 --> 14:11.115
Do you have any explanation
for this?

14:11.117 --> 14:14.385
- Oops.
- Oops?

14:14.387 --> 14:17.121
- That's it?
- Oops, sir.

14:18.625 --> 14:22.193
I'd like you to take
this check...to Mrs. Spencer.

14:22.195 --> 14:25.163
Sure.

14:25.165 --> 14:27.732
Oh, sir?

14:27.734 --> 14:29.133
Can I take your car?

14:29.135 --> 14:31.636
I don't wanna take my new car
into that part of town.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.574
No, take your car.

14:36.576 --> 14:39.711
Take it home
and don't come back!

14:41.181 --> 14:44.482
Denise, I found you
a parking space.

14:47.153 --> 14:48.887
Excuse me.

14:48.889 --> 14:50.555

14:55.362 --> 14:57.095
'...right from the heart
of the Orient.'

14:57.097 --> 14:59.664
'This complete set
of Ginsu Knives.'

14:59.666 --> 15:01.900
'Plus, if you act now,
you'll receive this'

15:01.902 --> 15:05.403
'handy potato peeler,
this automatic knife sharpener'

15:05.405 --> 15:07.772
'and this genuine
bronzite weather vane.'

15:07.774 --> 15:08.940
'Call now.'

15:08.942 --> 15:11.109
Oh, I will, I will!

15:11.111 --> 15:12.911
Listen, what are you doing?

15:12.913 --> 15:16.114
I'm buying you a genuine
bronzite weather vane.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.916
No, you're not.

15:17.918 --> 15:21.619
Kindly remember this when you
don't get a birthday present.

15:21.621 --> 15:24.622
[sighs]
Please, ALF, not tonight.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.624
I'm too tired.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.760
Rough day at the office, dear?

15:28.762 --> 15:30.328
You said..

15:33.366 --> 15:36.534
You know, I spent
six hours on that..

15:38.071 --> 15:39.804
- Freeway.
- Freeway.

15:41.107 --> 15:45.476
Nobody in my office likes
where they have to park.

15:45.478 --> 15:49.380
And on top of that,
I had to fire a guy today.

15:49.382 --> 15:53.551
Whoa! Swing that ax!

15:53.553 --> 15:56.487
I never fired anybody
in my entire life

15:56.489 --> 16:00.825
and I swear
I never wanna do it again!

16:00.827 --> 16:03.962
Well, that's what
George Steinbrenner always says.

16:05.598 --> 16:09.834
Sounds to me like you're not
too crazy about this new job.

16:09.836 --> 16:12.837
I'm-I'm having a little trouble
getting the hang of it

16:12.839 --> 16:14.472
that's all.

16:14.474 --> 16:19.110
Well, like my old
skleenball coach used to say

16:19.112 --> 16:22.113
"Find out
what you don't do well.

16:22.115 --> 16:23.748
Then don't do it."

16:25.986 --> 16:27.819
It's not that simple, ALF.

16:27.821 --> 16:31.089
There are other people
and things

16:31.091 --> 16:33.324
that depend on me.

16:33.326 --> 16:36.394
And-and I've got to consider
what's best for them.

16:38.198 --> 16:43.034
Well...this move
is a big mistake.

16:43.036 --> 16:44.936
I've got to do somethin'.

16:47.974 --> 16:50.508
Nah, that's too stupid.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.779
I'll do it anyway.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.716
[instrumental music]

17:01.554 --> 17:04.355
So how long have you lived here?

17:04.357 --> 17:05.957
All of our lives.

17:05.959 --> 17:07.859
We don't wanna move.

17:07.861 --> 17:11.195
Well, if we buy this house,
you can come and visit it.

17:11.197 --> 17:12.797
Call first.

17:14.567 --> 17:17.001
Uh, what can you tell us
about the neighborhood?

17:17.003 --> 17:18.903
Well, umm..

17:18.905 --> 17:21.639
[chuckles]
...the Ochmoneks take
a little getting used to.

17:21.641 --> 17:24.742
Ochmoneks? You can spray
for those, can't you?

17:25.879 --> 17:29.247
Oh, no, no,
those are our neighbors.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.215
You probably wouldn't like them.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.785
- Lynn!
- Although they're super people.

17:35.655 --> 17:39.590
Perhaps you'd like to take a
look at our ample closet space.

17:42.429 --> 17:43.961
I-I can fix that.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.564
[thuds]

17:47.400 --> 17:50.601
I'm not sure I can fix that.

17:50.603 --> 17:53.171
[chuckles]
Well, that's okay.
Howard will fix it.

17:53.173 --> 17:55.373
He's handy with tools.

17:55.375 --> 17:58.242
Yeah, lucky for me.

17:58.244 --> 18:00.678
Oh, honey,
look at the fireplace.

18:02.715 --> 18:06.751
- What was that?
- Oh, just...bricks.

18:06.753 --> 18:10.788
Uh, why don't we show you
the, uh, kitchen?

18:10.790 --> 18:14.492
Yes, yes, that's-that's where
the dishes are.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.629
- ALF?
- It's got to be.

18:18.631 --> 18:22.800
Oh, what an interesting
little kitchen.

18:22.802 --> 18:25.803
This will be great
once we change everything.

18:25.805 --> 18:29.140
Fortunately,
Howard is handy with tools.

18:29.142 --> 18:31.642
Yes, you mentioned that.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.686
That usually doesn't happen.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.989
Imagine our relief.

18:46.826 --> 18:49.827
You know, these are just little
things that are easily fixed.

18:49.829 --> 18:52.497
That doesn't mean it's not
like it's anything major.

18:52.499 --> 18:54.732
[rattling]

18:57.003 --> 18:58.803
Like the plumbing?

19:02.075 --> 19:06.644
Let me show you
the rest of the house. Come.

19:06.646 --> 19:11.516
Are-are you folks hiding
any other little defects?

19:11.518 --> 19:15.086
Just one and I'm going
to take care of it.

19:19.159 --> 19:21.025
The bedrooms are back here.

19:21.027 --> 19:22.593
[electricity crackling]

19:23.863 --> 19:26.697
Oh, that's, uh,
that's probably just a fuse.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.032
Who built this place?

19:28.034 --> 19:30.434
The Poltergeist
Construction Company?

19:31.704 --> 19:33.704
Yeah, was anyone
ever murdered here?

19:34.474 --> 19:35.940
Not so far.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.647
The master bedroom.

19:42.649 --> 19:45.583
Well, at first glance,
it seems harmless enough.

19:46.786 --> 19:49.787
Uh, we have wall-to-wall
carpeting and, umm..

19:49.789 --> 19:52.823
Uh, this room is back from
the street, so it's very quiet.

19:52.825 --> 19:55.560
And, umm, this, of course,
is where we sleep.

19:55.562 --> 19:57.695
[cracking]

20:02.368 --> 20:04.535
Although probably not tonight.

20:05.805 --> 20:09.574
- I think we've seen enough.
- Let's go, Howard.

20:09.576 --> 20:12.543
Uh, uh, let me show you
to the door.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.716
Oh, ALF.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.590
Could you get those two
back in here?

20:25.592 --> 20:27.725
They didn't even check
the bathroom.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.561
I loosened every third tile.

20:37.270 --> 20:41.772
This is not the worst thing
you've ever done.

20:41.774 --> 20:45.209
This is the 15th worst thing
you've ever done.

20:45.211 --> 20:47.178
What was number nine?

20:51.451 --> 20:54.685
The time you stuffed my shorts
in Thanksgiving turkey.

20:58.791 --> 21:02.526
What possible reason
could you have had for this?

21:02.528 --> 21:06.631
Nobody wants to move,
including you.

21:06.633 --> 21:07.965
How do you know that?

21:07.967 --> 21:10.601
Because you're a social worker.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.436
What's that got to do
with anything--

21:12.438 --> 21:15.273
Follow me, Willie.
I'm trying to be linear.

21:16.876 --> 21:19.977
Well, one could define
social worker

21:19.979 --> 21:22.146
as a person who performs work

21:22.148 --> 21:25.416
for the social good,
couldn't one?

21:25.418 --> 21:26.717
Yes.

21:26.719 --> 21:27.985
Well, then how come
all you're doing

21:27.987 --> 21:30.488
is playing
musical parking spaces

21:30.490 --> 21:32.690
and firing guys?

21:35.795 --> 21:38.329
You know, I also have
to find a shortstop

21:38.331 --> 21:40.231
for the office softball team.

21:41.401 --> 21:44.669
Try the Dominican Republic.

21:44.671 --> 21:46.804
Just tell me this.

21:46.806 --> 21:50.074
Why are we moving out
of a house we do like

21:50.076 --> 21:52.810
so you can keep a job
you don't like?

21:54.781 --> 21:57.181
I don't know.

21:57.183 --> 21:58.749
I win.

22:00.987 --> 22:04.188
- ALF, how could you--
- No, no, hold-hold on, Kate.

22:04.190 --> 22:08.025
Before we give ALF the 15th
worst scolding he's ever had

22:08.027 --> 22:10.695
I think there's something
you ought to know.

22:10.697 --> 22:13.431
Brian, Lynn, Kate..

22:13.433 --> 22:16.600
...how would you all feel
if I asked for my old job back

22:16.602 --> 22:18.202
and we just stayed
in this house?

22:18.204 --> 22:20.304
- Yay!
- Oh, do you mean it, dad?

22:20.306 --> 22:23.374
Of course, umm, I-I'm not gonna
have that raise, you know?

22:23.376 --> 22:25.109
Forget it, we'll move.

22:27.180 --> 22:28.713
Sorry.

22:28.715 --> 22:32.116
A momentary attack
of shallowness.

22:32.118 --> 22:34.118
I'm over it.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.887
Well, honey, y-you worked
so hard for this promotion.

22:36.889 --> 22:38.522
What made you change your mind?

22:38.524 --> 22:40.991
Actually, it was ALF
who convinced me

22:40.993 --> 22:44.195
we'd all be happier
if we stayed right here.

22:44.197 --> 22:46.464
(Kate)
Oh!

22:46.466 --> 22:48.199
Although..

22:48.201 --> 22:51.802
...instead of destroying
the house..

22:51.804 --> 22:54.672
...why didn't we just
talk about it?

22:54.674 --> 22:56.807
That was plan B.

23:04.917 --> 23:06.984
It's gonna take me
at least a couple of weekends

23:06.986 --> 23:08.719
to make these repairs,
you know.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.421
Well, you could have
Howard help you.

23:10.423 --> 23:12.256
He's handy with tools.

Hi, I'm here to see the house.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.933
Oh, I'm sorry.
We just took it off the market.

23:22.935 --> 23:25.202
What?
Are you jerking me around?

23:25.204 --> 23:27.438
Look, lady, I came
all the way from Costa Mesa

23:27.440 --> 23:28.739
to see this house

23:28.741 --> 23:31.342
and I really think
I should see the house.

23:31.344 --> 23:34.211
Well, you can see it,
but you're not gonna buy it.

23:34.213 --> 23:35.679
And why not?

23:38.284 --> 23:40.684
Whoa! I am out of here!

23:44.056 --> 23:47.858
Hey, great! Now we've got
a furnished basement.
