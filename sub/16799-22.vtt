00:01.430 --> 00:03.364
Previously on Elementary...I know you killed Jameel Clark.

00:03.400 --> 00:05.220
WATSON: He's worked for months to embed himself in SBK.

00:05.270 --> 00:06.737
An endeavor I cared more about

00:06.770 --> 00:08.032
before I knew he wasa cold-blooded killer.

00:08.070 --> 00:09.708
SBK is a ruthless drug gang.

00:09.740 --> 00:12.038
(grunts)

00:12.080 --> 00:12.705
SHINWELL: You want to knowwho killed Jameel?

00:12.740 --> 00:14.503
SBK killed Jameel.

00:14.540 --> 00:16.349
You're looking for someonewho killed one person.

00:16.380 --> 00:19.042
SBK kills dozensof people a year.

00:19.080 --> 00:20.069
I'm gonnatake SBK down.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.213
And anybody whoget in my way...

00:22.250 --> 00:26.311
(groans)...gonna get hurt.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.715
HOLMES:It's of the highest importancein the art of detection

00:28.760 --> 00:31.183
to be able to recognize,out of a number of facts,

00:31.230 --> 00:33.323
which are incidentaland which are vital.

00:33.360 --> 00:36.261
In this case, the keyto the whole matter

00:36.300 --> 00:38.097
can be looked forin the scrap of paper

00:38.130 --> 00:39.267
in the deadman's hand.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.336
That little "12"in the corner

00:41.370 --> 00:42.598
matches the numbersin your checkbook.

00:42.640 --> 00:43.834
You wrote that.

00:43.870 --> 00:45.167
GREGSON:More importantly,

00:45.210 --> 00:47.303
you wrote this,

00:47.340 --> 00:49.570
the rest of the letterthe victim was holding.

00:49.610 --> 00:51.271
We found the shreddedpieces of your missive

00:51.310 --> 00:54.575
in New York's Sunset Parkrecycling facility.

00:54.620 --> 00:57.384
My partner spent most oflast night reconstructing it.

00:57.420 --> 00:58.785
I like puzzles.

00:58.820 --> 01:00.788
GREGSON:It's an offer to pay

01:00.820 --> 01:02.356
William Kirwin for his silence.

01:02.390 --> 01:03.687
And a pretty flirty one,

01:03.730 --> 01:05.823
at that.

01:05.860 --> 01:08.397
We figure Kirwin witnessedyou two breaking into the home

01:08.430 --> 01:10.421
of your neighbor, Mr. Acton,

01:10.470 --> 01:12.392
while he was doinghis security patrol.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.761
And, instead of calling it in,

01:14.800 --> 01:16.267
he askedfor a payout.

01:16.310 --> 01:17.561
WATSON: So you luredhim to your home

01:17.610 --> 01:19.202
and shot him.

01:19.240 --> 01:21.231
And tried to make itlook like he was killed

01:21.280 --> 01:22.372
interrupting another break-in.

01:25.280 --> 01:26.872
Alex shot him.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.444
Give me a deal andI'll give you the gun.

01:28.480 --> 01:29.742
June, what the hell?

01:35.720 --> 01:37.381
(phone chimes)

01:40.430 --> 01:43.319
That businesswas a bad one.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.428
Something amiss?

01:46.470 --> 01:48.267
Oh, no, um, it's just my mom,

01:48.300 --> 01:49.562
reminding me about,uh, coffee tomorrow.

01:57.480 --> 01:59.243
(beeps)

01:59.280 --> 02:01.145
Test, test.

02:11.890 --> 02:13.357
(sniffs)

02:13.400 --> 02:14.389
Okay.

02:14.430 --> 02:15.727
You got this.

02:40.720 --> 02:42.278
(rustling)

02:46.560 --> 02:49.154
(squeaking)

03:08.580 --> 03:09.478
Got you.

03:13.990 --> 03:15.958
*

03:23.700 --> 03:25.588
That is curious.

03:25.630 --> 03:29.236
Marcus said the victimhad a paintball gun on her.

03:29.270 --> 03:30.464
Which is odd in itself.

03:30.510 --> 03:32.831
I was commenting onthe nature of the paint.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.677
Paintball pellets

03:34.710 --> 03:36.678
are filled withwater-soluble dyes.

03:36.710 --> 03:38.678
They create bright stains,

03:38.710 --> 03:40.575
but they're still easyto wash off skin and clothes.

03:40.620 --> 03:42.713
But none of this dyecame off on my finger.

03:42.750 --> 03:45.685
This is Disperse Red 9.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.415
That's the stuff indye packs that banks use

03:47.460 --> 03:48.518
when they're beingrobbed, right?

03:48.560 --> 03:49.925
Mm-hmm.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.518
This is the very oppositeof washable.

03:51.560 --> 03:52.925
Anything hit by oneof these pellets

03:52.960 --> 03:54.757
would be stained for days,if not weeks.

03:54.800 --> 03:58.520
Doesn't sound like somethingyou could buy commercially.

03:58.570 --> 03:59.764
Maybe a custom order?

03:59.800 --> 04:02.928
As I said, curious.

04:02.970 --> 04:04.608
Hey.

04:04.640 --> 04:07.768
Body's through here.Ready to take a look?

04:10.650 --> 04:13.346
Unis found her afterresponding to a shots fired.

04:13.380 --> 04:16.281
She took a shotgunblast to the chest,

04:16.320 --> 04:17.548
close range.

04:17.590 --> 04:18.648
Buckshot?

04:18.690 --> 04:21.682
Double-aught.Shooter meant business.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.553
No ID on the body,probably taken

04:24.590 --> 04:27.491
by the killer, so fornow, she's a Jane Doe.

04:27.530 --> 04:28.929
WATSON :So. ..

04:28.960 --> 04:32.020
these are spentpaintball casings.

04:32.070 --> 04:34.493
She fired a paintballgun at someone.

04:34.540 --> 04:37.407
Then her target returned firewith a shotgun.

04:37.440 --> 04:39.670
It's a pity the killeralso took her body camera

04:39.710 --> 04:41.507
or we could've actually seenwhat happened.

04:41.540 --> 04:44.043
How do you know she was wearinga body camera?

04:44.080 --> 04:46.048
This indentation here,

04:46.080 --> 04:47.843
it's the exact size and shape

04:47.880 --> 04:50.678
of a popular body cameraclip-on mount.

04:50.720 --> 04:51.948
Also, this isthe charger

04:51.990 --> 04:53.719
for such a device.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.352
BELL: Well, if you're right,got to think the killer

04:55.390 --> 04:56.789
didn't want toleave behind video

04:56.830 --> 04:58.718
of what he'd done.HOLMES:There's more.

04:58.760 --> 05:02.059
The victim's shirt has absorbedthe blood unevenly.

05:02.100 --> 05:04.898
It's more soaked in areasof excessive wear.

05:04.930 --> 05:07.728
And the wear patternis distinctive.

05:07.770 --> 05:09.635
Hmm. Sort oflike a vest.

05:09.670 --> 05:11.661
HOLMES: I submitthe one which

05:11.710 --> 05:15.578
once abraded the shirt wasof the bulletproof-variety.

05:15.610 --> 05:18.443
It also appears she oftenwore a shoulder holster,

05:18.480 --> 05:20.641
and note her hairstyle--it's off the neck,

05:20.680 --> 05:21.817
and she's notwearing any earrings.

05:21.850 --> 05:23.579
BELL:You know what?

05:23.620 --> 05:25.645
Her fingernails were cut shortand painted a neutral color;

05:25.690 --> 05:27.817
tactical boots;she's law enforcement.

05:27.860 --> 05:30.727
Active, too, or why keep upthe grooming standard?

05:30.760 --> 05:32.751
The FBI's NGI databasehas the fingerprints

05:32.800 --> 05:35.052
of anyone who's ever appliedfor a job in law enforcement,

05:35.100 --> 05:36.920
so it shouldn't take longto get a match.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.494
I'll getsomeone on it.

05:38.530 --> 05:39.633
I should get going, too.

05:39.670 --> 05:41.695
Let me know if you geta positive ID.

05:50.680 --> 05:53.649
Yeah, it's her.

05:53.680 --> 05:56.786
It's Chief Vlasik.

05:56.820 --> 05:58.708
Sorry for your loss.

06:00.690 --> 06:02.487
Any idea what a small-townNew Jersey police chief

06:02.530 --> 06:03.986
is doing running around New York

06:04.030 --> 06:05.429
with a paintball gun?

06:05.460 --> 06:06.654
None.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.850
Choice of weaponry aside,

06:08.900 --> 06:11.460
can you think of anyonewho would've wanted her dead?

06:11.500 --> 06:12.831
No. Nanette wasgood people.

06:12.870 --> 06:14.462
Everyone liked her.

06:14.500 --> 06:17.708
Any chance this wasabout police business?

06:17.740 --> 06:18.707
It's hard see how.

06:18.740 --> 06:19.934
She's out of her jurisdiction,

06:19.980 --> 06:22.869
no gun, no vest, no backup.

06:22.910 --> 06:25.549
Cypress Grove isa quiet town.

06:25.580 --> 06:27.673
She spent most of her timewriting speeding tickets.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.883
How did she seemat the office yesterday?

06:30.920 --> 06:32.785
I hadn't seen herin a couple weeks.

06:32.820 --> 06:35.653
As far as I knew, she wason vacation with the kids,

06:35.690 --> 06:37.453
visiting family in California.

06:37.490 --> 06:39.128
Called her sisteron the way here,

06:39.160 --> 06:41.822
the kids are safe in San Diego,but her sister told me

06:41.860 --> 06:45.569
they all thought the chief wasstill in Cypress Grove, working.

06:45.600 --> 06:46.897
So she sent her children away

06:46.940 --> 06:48.862
and then she liedto them and you

06:48.900 --> 06:50.868
about whatshe was up to.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.834
Was she behaving erratically inthe days leading up to her...

06:53.880 --> 06:55.677
supposed vacation?

06:55.710 --> 06:58.076
Did you noticeany atypical behavior?

06:58.110 --> 07:00.112
A few weeks ago, she, uh, spentan afternoon with her lawyer,

07:00.150 --> 07:01.777
going over some documents.

07:01.820 --> 07:04.687
When I asked what it was about,she dodged the question.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.119
But she seemed...

07:06.150 --> 07:08.880
I don't know... excited.

07:08.920 --> 07:10.421
That's all I got.

07:12.030 --> 07:14.021
(door opens, bell jingles)

07:15.560 --> 07:17.699
You came.

07:17.730 --> 07:19.539
Your text saidit was important.

07:21.740 --> 07:23.207
About me and Sherlock...

07:23.240 --> 07:25.731
If you brought me here toapologize, you can save it.

07:25.770 --> 07:28.000
I know who you are, now.I know what you are.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.008
I'm only here because

07:30.050 --> 07:31.802
I'm a consultant for the police,

07:31.850 --> 07:34.114
and you're an informantinside a gang, that's it.

07:35.180 --> 07:36.169
Then I'll get to it.

07:36.220 --> 07:37.687
I'm hitting a roadblock.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.551
I got a whole lot of evidence

07:39.590 --> 07:42.013
against SBK's rank and file.

07:42.060 --> 07:44.528
But nothing onthe leadership,

07:44.560 --> 07:47.028
the big rollers,'cause I have no access.

07:47.060 --> 07:49.199
What do you mean?

07:49.230 --> 07:51.221
They got me reportingto a lieutenant,

07:51.270 --> 07:53.534
G-Knot.

07:53.570 --> 07:56.038
Real name, DaMarco Bridger.

07:56.070 --> 07:58.209
He won't let his people

07:58.240 --> 07:59.537
meet with leadership directly,

07:59.580 --> 08:01.571
you got to report to him.

08:01.610 --> 08:02.872
So I need him gone.

08:02.910 --> 08:05.174
Not gone-gone,but I need him put away.

08:07.550 --> 08:11.111
If police move onan SBK lieutenant,

08:11.150 --> 08:14.153
they might start to worrythey've been compromised.

08:14.190 --> 08:17.023
They would... if you takehim out on gang business.

08:17.060 --> 08:19.620
Thing is, he got a side job.

08:19.660 --> 08:21.525
Low-rent murder for hire.

08:21.560 --> 08:24.199
I heard a guy had himstrangle his ex-wife,

08:24.230 --> 08:25.299
and another guy

08:25.330 --> 08:27.594
had him run overhis business partner,

08:27.640 --> 08:30.734
and the police didn'tlook at him in either case.

08:32.210 --> 08:33.234
But you're hopingI could tie him

08:33.280 --> 08:34.770
to one or the other.

08:34.810 --> 08:38.701
If you take Bridgeroff the streets,

08:38.750 --> 08:41.844
then I have a direct lineto the top dogs at SBK.

08:41.880 --> 08:45.145
And I can take themdown for good.

08:48.020 --> 08:49.726
We got thesefrom Nanette Vlasik's lawyer.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.728
A contract between Chief Vlasikand your production company

08:51.760 --> 08:53.250
for her to participateon a game show?

08:53.300 --> 08:55.655
Uh, Moving Targets isn't a game show,

08:55.700 --> 08:57.167
it's a competitionreality series.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.827
HOLMES: The term"reality television"

08:58.870 --> 09:00.838
is practically OnNellian,isn't it?

09:02.040 --> 09:03.166
I mean, you takewould-be actors,

09:03.210 --> 09:06.134
you put them inmanufactured situations

09:06.170 --> 09:07.728
and then you carefullyshape a narrative

09:07.780 --> 09:09.270
from hundredsof hours of footage,

09:09.310 --> 09:11.778
all to create suchgroundbreaking fare

09:11.810 --> 09:13.118
as Lil' Catwalk,

09:13.150 --> 09:14.811
Dog Lawyers,

09:14.850 --> 09:16.886
and That's Nasty.

09:16.920 --> 09:19.115
You're entitled to your opinion.

09:19.150 --> 09:20.879
So, from the title of your showand the custom paintballs

09:20.920 --> 09:22.785
found at the crime scene,

09:22.830 --> 09:24.582
I'm guessing it's some kindof people-hunting-people,

09:24.630 --> 09:26.257
Most Dangerous Game kind of thing?

09:26.290 --> 09:28.053
Yeah, it's basicallyhide-and-seek.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.261
We started with 30 contestants,

09:30.300 --> 09:32.791
we give them each the name ofa rival and a paintball gun,

09:32.840 --> 09:34.933
we told them to hunt down,shoot their target,

09:34.970 --> 09:37.234
while avoiding whoevermight be hunting them.

09:37.270 --> 09:39.261
Yeah, the, uh, Disperse Red 9,that was my idea.

09:39.310 --> 09:40.971
Wanted to make sureif someone got shot,

09:41.010 --> 09:42.602
they couldn't justwash away the evidence.

09:42.650 --> 09:44.606
I recorded a segment about it,if you guys want to see it.

09:44.650 --> 09:47.244
Jake isn't just a producer onthe show, he's also the host.

09:47.280 --> 09:50.010
So I'm guessing when someoneeliminates a competitor,

09:50.050 --> 09:52.245
they take on thatperson's target?

09:52.290 --> 09:53.689
Yeah, and onand on until

09:53.720 --> 09:55.608
there's only onecontestant left.

09:55.660 --> 09:57.685
Last one standinggets $1 million.

09:57.730 --> 10:00.824
Well, we're pretty sure NanetteVlasik was wearing a body camera

10:00.860 --> 10:02.862
when she was shot,but it's missing.

10:02.900 --> 10:05.994
I don't suppose there was also afilm crew recording last night?

10:06.030 --> 10:07.861
No, unlike your averagecompetition show,

10:07.900 --> 10:09.128
we don't-we don't haveany film crews.

10:09.170 --> 10:10.637
The competitors,

10:10.670 --> 10:12.160
they shoot their own footageusing the body cameras.

10:12.210 --> 10:14.838
"Reality unfettered,"that's our catchphrase.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.302
We give themcell phones

10:16.340 --> 10:18.979
for emergency contact,but otherwise,

10:19.010 --> 10:20.318
they're on their own.

10:20.350 --> 10:22.215
So how was Vlasikdoing on the show?

10:22.250 --> 10:23.285
Good.

10:23.320 --> 10:25.185
Really good; withher police training,

10:25.220 --> 10:26.983
she'd already eliminatedthree other contestants.

10:27.020 --> 10:28.658
Now, she was, uh...she was looking like

10:28.690 --> 10:30.226
one of our favorites.

10:30.260 --> 10:33.650
A million dollars is a prettystrong motive for murder.

10:33.700 --> 10:35.998
Are you suggesting thatChief Vlasik's last target

10:36.030 --> 10:37.691
is a likely personto have killed her?

10:37.730 --> 10:39.288
BELL: She tags himwith a paintball,

10:39.330 --> 10:42.037
he murders herto avoid elimination.

10:42.070 --> 10:44.868
So who wasChief Vlasik hunting?

10:44.910 --> 10:46.366
JAKE: This is Nanette'scurrent target,

10:46.410 --> 10:48.833
Dr. Charles Eriyo.

10:48.880 --> 10:50.905
He's an ER residentat Chandler Memorial.

10:50.950 --> 10:52.679
DARIA: He's also avegetarian, a church-goer,

10:52.720 --> 10:55.746
and he volunteers with thehomeless in his free time.

10:55.780 --> 10:58.385
We call contestantslike him "Dudleys,"

10:58.420 --> 11:00.308
as in Dudley Do-Right.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.009
Yeah, it's hard to imagine himdoing what you think he did.

11:02.060 --> 11:04.949
We'll give you whateverwe have on him.

11:11.470 --> 11:13.791
Hey.

11:17.440 --> 11:19.260
How is Shinwell?

11:19.310 --> 11:23.178
Excuse me?Shinwell.

11:23.210 --> 11:26.099
Shinwell Johnson.Sleepy-eyed gang informant,

11:26.150 --> 11:28.971
chess aficionado, murderer--ring any bells?

11:29.020 --> 11:30.783
You saw the textI got last night.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.378
I did not.

11:32.420 --> 11:34.012
You and your mothertypically caffeinate

11:34.060 --> 11:35.254
at a coffee shopin Manhattan.

11:35.290 --> 11:37.019
You and Shinwell,on the other hand,

11:37.060 --> 11:39.756
like to meet at acoffee bar in Bergen Beach.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.427
The shop's signature blendhas a high percentage

11:41.460 --> 11:43.997
of Sumatran beans,and that distinctive,

11:44.030 --> 11:45.395
pervasive scentwafted my way

11:45.430 --> 11:46.692
as soon as you took offyour coat.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.500
He said it was important.

11:51.540 --> 11:53.178
I'm not a child.

11:53.210 --> 11:54.768
You needn't keepsuch appointments from me.

11:54.810 --> 11:56.277
A street gangneeds dismantling,

11:56.310 --> 11:59.347
and he is, for better or worse,the best way to do that.

11:59.380 --> 12:01.974
I've come to termswith the situation.

12:05.090 --> 12:06.489
So how's it going here?

12:06.520 --> 12:09.114
Did the police findthat doctor you texted me about?

12:09.160 --> 12:12.049
No. Dr. Eriyo is notanswering the phone

12:12.090 --> 12:13.796
given to him bythe producers of the show

12:13.830 --> 12:16.048
that he and Chief Vlasikwere participating in.

12:16.100 --> 12:18.261
And as it turns out,he's quite skilled

12:18.300 --> 12:19.858
at hiding inan open environment.

12:19.900 --> 12:21.390
That is not surprising,

12:21.440 --> 12:24.307
given what I uncoveredabout him.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.135
All this on Dr. Eriyo?

12:29.180 --> 12:30.772
HOLMES: Turned out to bea bit of a mystery

12:30.810 --> 12:32.300
in his own right.

12:32.350 --> 12:34.375
His official recordis laudable.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.274
He grew up in a Ugandanrefugee camp.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.311
He came to the U.S.when he was 19,

12:38.350 --> 12:40.386
thanks to a church groupsponsorship.

12:40.420 --> 12:42.308
Summa cum laudeat university,

12:42.360 --> 12:43.452
then went on tomedical school,

12:43.490 --> 12:46.482
where he graduatedtop of his class.

12:46.530 --> 12:49.397
He now specializesin emergency medicine

12:49.430 --> 12:51.796
at one of New York'stop teaching hospitals.

12:51.830 --> 12:53.434
I'm sensing a "but."

12:53.470 --> 12:55.836
Well, it's all builton a lie.

12:55.870 --> 12:58.134
The producers of Moving Targets provided us

12:58.170 --> 13:00.502
with all of the footagethey had on Dr. Eriyo.

13:00.540 --> 13:03.475
Not just gameplay,but also video

13:03.510 --> 13:05.341
from a meet and greet,

13:05.380 --> 13:07.473
where the playerswent over the rules,

13:07.520 --> 13:09.374
got to meet one another.There was also this.

13:09.420 --> 13:11.012
Ms. Wyngold wantedthem all

13:11.050 --> 13:12.347
to look their best,

13:12.390 --> 13:14.210
so she gave themmakeovers--

13:14.260 --> 13:16.080
haircuts, new clothes,that kind of thing.

13:16.120 --> 13:17.519
This is from Dr. Eriyo's

13:17.560 --> 13:20.552
wardrobe fitting.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.352
WATSON:Those scars,

13:22.400 --> 13:23.321
they look decorative.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.497
Ritual scarification,whilst on the wane,

13:25.530 --> 13:28.237
is still practiced by somerural African populations.

13:28.270 --> 13:30.261
These scars identify Dr. Eriyo

13:30.310 --> 13:32.528
as a member of theKaramojong tribe.

13:32.570 --> 13:34.902
But there are other scarsas well.

13:36.310 --> 13:37.504
WATSON:O|d bullet wounds.

13:39.550 --> 13:41.939
HOLMES: This long oneis from a panga.

13:41.980 --> 13:44.448
It's an East African machete.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.414
A curious collectionof damage, for sure.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.485
The last time it was described

13:49.520 --> 13:53.195
was 15 years ago,on this wanted poster.

13:53.230 --> 13:56.859
WATSON: "Akello Akeny,a.k.a. The Ghost of Gulu."

13:56.900 --> 13:59.528
Same facial features,

13:59.570 --> 14:02.562
same list of scars.

14:02.600 --> 14:05.330
He and Dr. Eriyo arethe same person.

14:05.370 --> 14:07.577
We thought we were lookingfor a sore loser on a game show.

14:07.610 --> 14:10.443
It turns out our quarryused to be a child soldier

14:10.480 --> 14:13.472
in a rebel militia calledHeaven's Shining Army.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.317
Whilst he wasalmost certainly

14:15.350 --> 14:17.147
an unwilling conscript,

14:17.190 --> 14:19.545
he did lead a death squadresponsible for hundreds

14:19.590 --> 14:22.980
of murders in and aroundthe Ugandan city of Gulu.

14:23.030 --> 14:25.021
I mean, in all ouryears together, Watson,

14:25.060 --> 14:26.357
we may never have seena more accomplished killer.

14:34.670 --> 14:36.228
A reality show managedto cast a war criminal

14:36.270 --> 14:37.464
as one of their contestants?

14:37.510 --> 14:39.637
Well, it's morecomplicated than that.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.479
Akeny was a child soldier,

14:41.510 --> 14:44.968
so, obviously there's a greatdeal of coercion, et cetera,

14:45.010 --> 14:46.443
involved in their actions.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.175
Unlike the manyNazis who came here

14:48.220 --> 14:49.346
after the SecondWorld War,

14:49.380 --> 14:51.041
he is no longer wantedfor the crimes

14:51.090 --> 14:52.239
he committed in Uganda.

14:52.290 --> 14:53.917
It turns out theUgandan government

14:53.960 --> 14:55.359
recently signed a treaty

14:55.390 --> 14:57.278
with Akello's militiathat included

14:57.330 --> 14:59.059
an amnesty clause.

14:59.090 --> 15:00.455
So as far as they're concerned,he's free and clear,

15:00.500 --> 15:01.956
and they don't want him back.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.969
You issue a want card?

15:05.000 --> 15:06.524
I also had TARU pingthe cell phone

15:06.570 --> 15:08.959
the Moving Targets gave him,but there was no signal.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.003
The last time it connected toa tower was near Chelsea Piers.

15:12.040 --> 15:13.302
You think he threw itin the Hudson River?

15:13.340 --> 15:17.379
So...

15:17.410 --> 15:19.571
anyone know howto catch a ghost?

15:19.610 --> 15:21.373
I have a notion.

15:24.190 --> 15:26.442
MAN (loudly):Three, two, one.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.481
All right,great job, guys.

15:28.520 --> 15:31.387
Left to right,split stretch.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.523
Ten times, let's go.

15:33.560 --> 15:35.994
Bo, same directionas everyone else.

15:36.030 --> 15:37.463
Detective Acosta...

15:37.500 --> 15:38.990
Oh, you Wendell's mom?

15:39.030 --> 15:40.691
Uh, I'm Joan Watson.

15:40.740 --> 15:43.709
I work as a consultant forCaptain Gregson at the 11th.

15:43.740 --> 15:45.435
I'm sorry to bother youon your day off.

15:45.470 --> 15:47.370
You caught the Veah Hayesmurder case, right?

15:47.410 --> 15:48.604
That's right.

15:48.640 --> 15:50.471
I may have a lead.

15:50.510 --> 15:54.640
First guys on the scene thoughtit was an attempted rape.

15:54.680 --> 15:57.444
She fought back,attacker strangled her.

15:57.490 --> 16:00.516
My bosses pushed itas a serial.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.619
Tried to connect it tothat case in Kissena Park--

16:02.660 --> 16:05.549
the jogger-- butI wasn't so sure.

16:05.590 --> 16:08.127
Looks like you talkedto the ex-husband a few times?

16:08.160 --> 16:09.457
Yeah. Ezra Hayes.Veah was suing him

16:09.500 --> 16:10.728
for unpaid alimony.

16:10.770 --> 16:11.725
But the night of the murder,

16:11.770 --> 16:12.759
Ezra was working in one

16:12.800 --> 16:14.631
of his bodegasacross town.

16:14.670 --> 16:16.558
And he wasn't a match forthe trace DNA evidence

16:16.600 --> 16:17.703
we found underVeah's fingernails.

16:17.740 --> 16:20.129
No match, nowitnesses, no prints,

16:20.180 --> 16:21.499
case went cold.

16:21.540 --> 16:23.246
So what's your lead?

16:23.280 --> 16:25.703
I got an anonymous tipthat Ezra Hayes hired

16:25.750 --> 16:27.570
an SBK lieutenantnamed DaMarco Bridger

16:27.620 --> 16:29.542
to kill his ex-wife.

16:29.580 --> 16:32.242
If you check Bridges' DNA,I'm pretty sure it'll match.

16:32.290 --> 16:35.259
It's gonna take morethan a tip to get a warrant.

16:35.290 --> 16:36.552
The M.E. who autopsied Veah

16:36.590 --> 16:39.650
found traces of wood dustin the wounds on her neck.

16:39.690 --> 16:41.123
He thought it might transfersfrom the work gloves

16:41.160 --> 16:43.424
that the killer wore.I looked into that.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.495
The dust was from a high-endhardwood called "ipe."

16:45.530 --> 16:47.737
I checked with everyonein the area that sells

16:47.770 --> 16:50.466
or installs the stuff, butdidn't turn up any suspects.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.603
You were on the right track.You just needed Bridger's name.

16:52.640 --> 16:55.609
So, yesterday I wentto his mother's house

16:55.640 --> 16:57.198
in New Rochelle.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.639
Take a lookat her front porch.

16:59.680 --> 17:03.184
The wood.It's ipe, isn't it?

17:03.220 --> 17:04.517
I knocked on her door,

17:04.550 --> 17:06.040
I told her I liked her deck.

17:06.090 --> 17:07.250
When I said I mightbe interested

17:07.290 --> 17:08.518
in hiring her carpenter,she said that

17:08.560 --> 17:10.482
her son DaMarcoinstalled it himself.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.680
He did the work two years ago,right around the time

17:12.730 --> 17:14.357
that Veah was murdered.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.652
That should be enoughto get a warrant, right?

17:18.570 --> 17:19.628
Me, too.

17:19.670 --> 17:21.695
I'll see you later.

17:25.140 --> 17:27.108
All is well with Chantal?

17:27.140 --> 17:29.131
She started physicaltherapy today.

17:29.180 --> 17:31.148
I asked her to call me andlet me know how it went.

17:31.180 --> 17:33.068
And?

17:33.120 --> 17:35.315
She crushed it.

17:35.350 --> 17:37.147
Any sign of our target?

17:37.190 --> 17:40.216
As a matter of fact,there is.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.659
I thought it bestto wait for you.

17:41.690 --> 17:43.658
So now that you're back...

17:58.310 --> 18:01.234
Hello.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.305
He's the police.

18:03.350 --> 18:05.477
We know that you're acontestant on Moving Targets,

18:05.510 --> 18:07.239
but the game is over,

18:07.280 --> 18:09.510
and I really must insistyou come with us.

18:09.550 --> 18:11.643
WOMAN: Okay...

18:11.690 --> 18:13.658
so the selfie I tookoutside this place

18:13.690 --> 18:17.251
is spreading on socialmedia-- 200 shares already.

18:17.290 --> 18:20.691
If that Dr. Eriyo--Akello-- whoever,

18:20.730 --> 18:22.425
is still trying to tag me,

18:22.460 --> 18:24.621
this should gethis attention.

18:24.670 --> 18:27.332
I've got to ask,how did you find me?

18:27.370 --> 18:29.235
The producers of Moving Targets

18:29.270 --> 18:30.908
provided us with yourbody-camera footage.

18:30.940 --> 18:33.170
Most of which couldonly have been shot

18:33.210 --> 18:37.579
through the semi-translucenteye hole of an oversized mask.

18:37.610 --> 18:39.544
I knew I couldn't counton winning
a millionbucks on a game show,

18:39.580 --> 18:41.548
so, you know, Ikept my day job.

18:41.580 --> 18:43.548
HOLMES:Hmm.

18:43.590 --> 18:44.909
Well, I'd liketo thank you again

18:44.950 --> 18:47.418
for cooperatingso readily.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.553
WOMAN: Please. "CostumedCharacter Helps Catch Killer."

18:49.590 --> 18:50.921
I mean, that story'spractically guaranteed

18:50.960 --> 18:52.279
to go viral.

18:52.330 --> 18:54.548
I mean,that's the reason why

18:54.600 --> 18:56.659
I went on Moving Targets in the first place,

18:56.700 --> 18:59.260
to try and breakout as an actor.

19:02.870 --> 19:05.168
It seems like yourwould-be shooter has arrived.

19:05.210 --> 19:06.632
(siren whoops)

19:06.670 --> 19:08.638
Hold it right there.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.170
(tires screeching)Excuse me.

19:14.680 --> 19:17.319
It's a, it's a toy.

19:20.890 --> 19:23.654
Armed with a paintball gunand wearing a body camera,

19:23.690 --> 19:24.918
just like our victim.

19:24.960 --> 19:29.499
Dr. Eriyo, we'vebeen expecting you.

19:29.530 --> 19:31.566
Or do you prefer"Akello"?

19:36.540 --> 19:39.634
AKELLO:It's true, I have done

19:39.670 --> 19:42.707
terrible things in my life.

19:42.740 --> 19:45.538
HOLMES: So you can confirmyou were the Ghost of Gulu?

19:45.580 --> 19:47.343
Much to my shame.

19:47.380 --> 19:48.779
But you mustunderstand,

19:48.820 --> 19:50.742
Heaven's Shining Armykidnapped me when

19:50.790 --> 19:52.382
I was just a boy.

19:52.420 --> 19:54.308
I was told if I did notfollow orders,

19:54.360 --> 19:56.749
my father would be killed,and my mother and sister

19:56.790 --> 19:58.724
suffer even worse fates.

19:58.760 --> 20:00.751
The only way I wasable to escape was

20:00.800 --> 20:02.825
to fake my own death.

20:02.860 --> 20:04.828
I got away.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.963
I made a new life.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.695
I don't think that'd bemuch comfort

20:08.740 --> 20:10.435
to your victims' families.

20:10.470 --> 20:12.859
Nothing I do will evermake up for my crimes,

20:12.910 --> 20:15.572
but that won't stop mefrom trying.

20:18.310 --> 20:20.244
I'll spend the rest of my lifetrying to help

20:20.280 --> 20:21.679
more people than I harmed.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.813
It's the only wayI can justify

20:23.850 --> 20:25.841
all the blessingsI've received.

20:25.890 --> 20:30.281
A man who deserves none.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.752
In the interviews you didfor Moving Targets,

20:31.790 --> 20:33.724
you said that if you won,you were planning on

20:33.760 --> 20:35.648
giving the milliondollars to charity?

20:35.700 --> 20:37.429
I only signed upfor the show as a way

20:37.470 --> 20:39.768
to help the peopleof my homeland.

20:39.800 --> 20:42.769
To bring attentionto those who are suffering.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.836
Were I to win,I'd hoped to open

20:44.870 --> 20:46.758
a free clinic in Gulu.

20:46.810 --> 20:48.801
Sounds very important to you.

20:50.810 --> 20:52.869
Was it important enoughto kill another competitor

20:52.910 --> 20:54.878
to guarantee your victory?

20:54.920 --> 20:57.809
I know why you'd asksuch a thing,

20:57.850 --> 21:00.819
but at this point in my life,I could never bring myself

21:00.860 --> 21:04.284
to kill another human beingunder any circumstances.

21:04.330 --> 21:05.957
Certainly notover a game.

21:05.990 --> 21:07.992
Check the footagefrom my body camera.

21:08.030 --> 21:09.622
It will show youI had nothing to do

21:09.660 --> 21:10.729
with Nanette's death.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.795
Actually, we already checked.

21:12.830 --> 21:14.764
At the timeof Nanette Vlasik's death,

21:14.800 --> 21:16.836
your camerawas recording footage

21:16.870 --> 21:19.839
of different costumedcharacters around Times Square.

21:19.870 --> 21:21.303
Exactly.

21:21.340 --> 21:23.501
I was lookingfor my next target in the game.

21:23.550 --> 21:24.699
BELL:Problem is,

21:24.750 --> 21:26.775
whoever was wearingthat camera never spoke,

21:26.810 --> 21:28.471
never turned it on themselves,

21:28.520 --> 21:29.942
never filmedany reflective surfaces.

21:29.980 --> 21:32.847
Could've been anyonecarrying it around.

21:32.890 --> 21:34.414
Did you talk to anyone

21:34.460 --> 21:35.859
when the camera wasn't rollingthat night?

21:35.890 --> 21:38.358
Anyone who might remember you?

21:39.890 --> 21:43.326
These last few weeks,I took up old habits.

21:43.370 --> 21:45.725
Talk to no one,avoid cameras.

21:45.770 --> 21:48.364
I even threw away my phoneso I couldn't be tracked.

21:48.400 --> 21:50.061
I used all of my tricks,

21:50.100 --> 21:52.603
both during the game,and before it started.

21:52.640 --> 21:55.006
What do you mean?

21:55.040 --> 21:59.409
They held a get-together for us,a week before the game began.

21:59.450 --> 22:00.849
Yes, we're aware.

22:00.880 --> 22:01.869
They filmedthe gathering

22:01.920 --> 22:03.547
to help build their narratives.

22:03.590 --> 22:05.615
This person hates that person.

22:05.650 --> 22:07.914
This man is attracted tothat woman, the usual nonsense,

22:07.960 --> 22:09.916
but I used it as a way

22:09.960 --> 22:11.928
to evaluate mycompetition,

22:11.960 --> 22:13.928
to identifythe best players in the game,

22:13.960 --> 22:15.996
including Nanette Vlasik.

22:16.030 --> 22:19.363
You realize you're admittingyou considered her a threat.

22:19.400 --> 22:21.095
I'll admit to more than that.

22:21.140 --> 22:23.358
I stalked her.

22:23.410 --> 22:25.833
Over the next week, Ifollowed all the players

22:25.870 --> 22:27.929
I thought were threats.

22:27.980 --> 22:30.448
Filmed them.Studied their habits.

22:30.480 --> 22:33.711
The same way I would researchmy targets back in Gulu.

22:33.750 --> 22:37.948
I knew what people atefor lunch, who they were dating.

22:37.990 --> 22:40.788
With Nanette Vlasik, I sawhow much she loved her children,

22:40.820 --> 22:43.380
how dedicated she wasto her job.

22:43.430 --> 22:46.456
But I also saw somethingI could not explain.

22:46.490 --> 22:47.650
And now,

22:47.700 --> 22:48.928
you tell meshe's dead.

22:48.960 --> 22:50.825
What did you see?

22:50.870 --> 22:54.033
One morning,she went into a strip club.

22:54.070 --> 22:56.493
She seemed nervous--evasive, even.

22:56.540 --> 22:58.633
She was inside foronly a few minutes,

22:58.670 --> 23:01.673
then she came outand quickly drove away.

23:01.710 --> 23:03.507
It was odd.

23:03.550 --> 23:05.177
I took picturesof the entire incident

23:05.210 --> 23:07.075
with a telephoto camera.

23:07.110 --> 23:08.873
GREGSON: So now you don't like Akello

23:08.920 --> 23:10.547
for the murder?

23:10.590 --> 23:12.888
While his body camera footageis hardly an alibi,

23:12.920 --> 23:14.956
it does suggesthis innocence.

23:14.990 --> 23:17.629
And then, there arethese photos he took.

23:19.990 --> 23:21.799
The Glitter House?

23:21.830 --> 23:23.889
That's a placein Paterson, New Jersey.

23:23.930 --> 23:25.488
You know it?

23:25.530 --> 23:26.792
By reputation.

23:26.830 --> 23:28.468
All of it bad.

23:28.500 --> 23:29.660
HOLMES: Note the envelopein Chief Vlasik's hand

23:29.700 --> 23:31.429
as she emerges.

23:31.470 --> 23:33.938
It's about the lengthand width of US. currency.

23:33.980 --> 23:37.802
If those are hundreds, we'retalking at least a few grand.

23:37.850 --> 23:38.748
The Glitter Houseis a mob front.

23:38.780 --> 23:40.145
If Nanette Vlasikis walking out of there

23:40.180 --> 23:41.647
with money in her hand...

23:41.680 --> 23:43.489
It could meanshe was on the take.

23:43.520 --> 23:44.987
It could meanmore than that.

23:45.020 --> 23:47.045
Our suspect poolisn't just a bunch of people

23:47.090 --> 23:49.081
playing a game anymore.

23:49.120 --> 23:51.020
It's the Jersey mob, too.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.499
Doesn't look good, does it?

24:00.540 --> 24:01.461
Chief Vlasik comingout of your place

24:01.500 --> 24:03.536
with an envelope like that?

24:03.570 --> 24:06.164
Could be a stackof napkins in there.

24:06.210 --> 24:07.575
You don't know.

24:07.610 --> 24:09.009
HOLMES:We don't.

24:09.040 --> 24:10.576
But say she was in your pocket,

24:10.610 --> 24:12.703
and say the two of youhad a falling out.

24:12.750 --> 24:14.741
She wouldn't bethe first of your associates

24:14.780 --> 24:16.748
to come to a bad endin a deserted location.

24:16.780 --> 24:18.680
BELL: Al "Nudgy" Mancusowas bludgeoned to death

24:18.720 --> 24:20.688
in an upstate fishing cabin,

24:20.720 --> 24:24.520
Leo "Tuna Town" Divino was shotin a vacant Newark warehouse,

24:24.560 --> 24:26.551
and your brother-in-lawMilo Spitz

24:26.590 --> 24:27.750
was found dead in his car

24:27.800 --> 24:29.256
at South MountainReservation.

24:29.300 --> 24:31.029
Milo committed suicide.

24:31.070 --> 24:33.220
He was stabbed 16 times.

24:33.270 --> 24:35.238
Hardest he ever workedin his life.

24:35.270 --> 24:37.238
You can see how,from our perspective,

24:37.270 --> 24:40.034
Nanette Vlasik's deathfits a certain pattern.

24:40.070 --> 24:41.708
(laughs)

24:41.740 --> 24:43.207
Well, you've obviously doneyour homework on me,

24:43.240 --> 24:47.074
so I'm figuring you knowwhy I need this cane.

24:47.110 --> 24:49.544
You were shot.Theoretically, by a rival,

24:49.580 --> 24:50.842
and no one was ever arrested.

24:50.890 --> 24:52.744
And since then,I've kept my guard up.

24:52.790 --> 24:55.714
I asked Chief Vlasik to putpatrol cars outside my house,

24:55.760 --> 24:58.558
make sure my kidsget to school safe,

24:58.590 --> 25:01.559
let me know if there's anyonesuspicious in town.

25:01.600 --> 25:02.794
That kind of thing.

25:02.830 --> 25:04.695
You co-optedthe Cypress Grove Police

25:04.730 --> 25:07.198
and turned them intoyour own private security force.

25:09.300 --> 25:11.530
Okay, everyone: take five.

25:11.570 --> 25:12.935
Let's go.

25:12.970 --> 25:14.972
You too, guys.

25:17.680 --> 25:19.671
Few months back,

25:19.710 --> 25:22.019
Nanette went througha rough time.

25:22.050 --> 25:23.984
Death in the family, I think.

25:24.020 --> 25:26.682
Instead of mourning, she throwsherself into her work.

25:26.720 --> 25:28.688
Starts pulling late hoursat the office,

25:28.720 --> 25:31.154
taking out-of-town meetings.

25:31.190 --> 25:33.226
She even screenedmy calls a few times.

25:33.260 --> 25:34.557
When I told herI didn't like that,

25:34.600 --> 25:35.726
she said she was workingon a case.

25:35.760 --> 25:37.864
"Something big," she said.

25:37.900 --> 25:39.993
Then, about a month ago,

25:40.030 --> 25:41.691
she asked me for a favor.

25:41.740 --> 25:44.004
She asked me to introduce herto a friend of mine,

25:44.040 --> 25:45.962
a guy who worksat a big national bank.

25:46.010 --> 25:48.228
He handlesmy more delicate transactions.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.976
Your money launderer,she wanted to meet him.

25:51.010 --> 25:52.875
I can't give youmy friend's name.

25:52.910 --> 25:55.572
But I can ask him what heand Nanette talked about.

25:55.620 --> 25:57.178
'Cause if she wasinto something so big

25:57.220 --> 25:59.085
she needed helpfrom a guy like him?

25:59.120 --> 26:02.715
That's the kind of thingthat can get a person shot.

26:08.860 --> 26:13.320
Courtesyof Detective Acosta.

26:13.370 --> 26:15.964
He stopped by whileyou were in the shower.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.604
Thanks.

26:17.640 --> 26:19.062
He wanted you to know that

26:19.110 --> 26:20.600
an SBK membernamed DaMarco Bridger

26:20.640 --> 26:23.131
had been arrested, so...

26:23.180 --> 26:24.977
I take it that bringsto a conclusion

26:25.010 --> 26:27.308
your recent businesswith Shinwell?

26:27.350 --> 26:29.318
Yeah.

26:29.350 --> 26:31.079
It does.

26:31.120 --> 26:32.610
Because Acostawas not the only detective

26:32.650 --> 26:34.652
who came bearing gifts.

26:35.990 --> 26:38.652
So Marcus broughtthese over.

26:38.690 --> 26:40.021
He got them fromPhil Righetti,

26:40.060 --> 26:41.618
who got them fromhis money launderer,

26:41.660 --> 26:42.854
who says they'recopies of everything

26:42.900 --> 26:44.094
Nanette Vlasik asked him for.

26:44.130 --> 26:45.768
Bank statements?

26:45.800 --> 26:47.199
From dozens of accounts and from

26:47.230 --> 26:48.788
to high-ranking police officers

26:48.840 --> 26:50.637
all over the country.

26:50.670 --> 26:53.138
Wait, Nanette Vlasikasked Righetti's banker

26:53.170 --> 26:54.330
to look into cops?

26:54.380 --> 26:56.109
With good reason, apparently.

26:56.140 --> 26:58.870
He claims that eachof these account holders,

26:58.910 --> 27:01.640
most of them police chiefsor county sheriffs,

27:01.680 --> 27:03.341
received large wire transfers

27:03.380 --> 27:05.416
from the same offshorebank account.

27:05.450 --> 27:06.747
They were taking bribes.

27:06.790 --> 27:07.950
Not dissimilarto what happened

27:07.990 --> 27:09.685
between Vlasik and Righetti,

27:09.720 --> 27:11.779
but on a massive scale.

27:12.930 --> 27:14.227
Okay, so who would bribe

27:14.260 --> 27:16.956
dozens of police chiefsand sheriffs?

27:17.000 --> 27:18.399
A drug gang?A foreign government?

27:18.430 --> 27:20.421
It's not clear.What's also not clear

27:20.470 --> 27:23.735
is what Vlasik did withthe information, if anything.

27:23.770 --> 27:26.364
But it stands to reason shemade some powerful enemies.

27:26.410 --> 27:29.106
I'm hoping that the answer liessomewhere within.

27:29.140 --> 27:32.109
So is there a particular stackthat takes your fancy?

27:39.850 --> 27:43.217
Do you anticipate hearingfrom him again in the future?

27:43.260 --> 27:44.682
Who, Acosta?

27:44.730 --> 27:46.823
Shinwell.

27:46.860 --> 27:49.693
I don't know, maybe.

27:51.200 --> 27:53.760
I thought you said you'd"come to terms" with everything.

27:53.800 --> 27:54.960
I did.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.831
So what's the problem?

27:58.470 --> 28:00.700
There are times that I fearyou still see him

28:00.740 --> 28:02.435
as a surgical patient,

28:02.480 --> 28:06.007
who, with your assistance,can survive, and even thrive.

28:06.050 --> 28:10.339
Yet, despite your ministrations,he's not reformed one iota.

28:10.380 --> 28:12.018
He still resortsto violence and deception

28:12.050 --> 28:14.257
as his first instincts.

28:14.290 --> 28:18.249
Even his crusade to topple SBKis motivated purely by revenge.

28:18.290 --> 28:20.019
Isn't that all that matters?

28:20.060 --> 28:21.925
Putting an end to SBK?

28:21.960 --> 28:23.496
Not to me.

28:23.530 --> 28:26.328
You are accustomedto helping people

28:26.370 --> 28:28.235
who wantto help themselves.

28:28.270 --> 28:30.158
He's different.

28:30.200 --> 28:33.408
Doesn't want to help himself,he just wants to hurt others.

28:33.440 --> 28:35.908
I've becomequite certain

28:35.940 --> 28:41.116
that in the end,he'll hurt you, as well.

28:41.150 --> 28:44.711
You know, you make him soundlike a lost cause.

28:46.250 --> 28:48.354
Some people might've saidyou were a lost cause once.

28:48.390 --> 28:50.415
Well, I may still be.(chuckles)

28:50.460 --> 28:52.758
One of the reasons

28:52.790 --> 28:54.052
I work so hardnot to lose myself

28:54.100 --> 28:56.751
is 'cause I fearI would also lose you.

29:00.840 --> 29:04.332
Do you think Shinwell isputting forth a similar effort?

29:07.570 --> 29:09.174
You know, if we're gonna stay upall night,

29:09.210 --> 29:11.371
I'm gonna need coffee.

29:37.500 --> 29:38.865
(door opens)

29:38.910 --> 29:40.161
You're sleeping.

29:40.210 --> 29:41.370
Hmm?

29:41.410 --> 29:42.536
You never sleep.

29:42.580 --> 29:45.902
I rarely sleep.There is a difference.

29:47.210 --> 29:49.075
Are you okay?

29:51.220 --> 29:52.539
I, uh...(clears throat)

29:52.590 --> 29:54.182
I realized late last night,

29:54.220 --> 29:56.381
that while the membersof law enforcement

29:56.420 --> 29:58.354
identified in these statements

29:58.390 --> 30:01.223
had motive to killNanette Vlasik,

30:01.260 --> 30:02.921
very few of themhad the opportunity.

30:02.960 --> 30:05.064
So I began to suspect that, uh,

30:05.100 --> 30:06.590
the killer might beat the other end

30:06.630 --> 30:09.360
of the transactionsshe uncovered.

30:09.400 --> 30:12.506
So you think it'swhoever's behind the bribes.

30:12.540 --> 30:14.007
Unfortunately, Righetti's bankerwas unable to identify

30:14.040 --> 30:15.530
the initiating party,

30:15.580 --> 30:17.946
so I wondered if ourold hacker friend,

30:17.980 --> 30:20.869
"Sucking Chest Wound,"might fare any better.

30:20.920 --> 30:26.381
He was ableto trace the payments

30:26.420 --> 30:28.217
to Alpha Hawk Firearms,

30:28.260 --> 30:30.455
which is a Connecticut companywhich manufactures,

30:30.490 --> 30:32.924
among other killing machines,

30:32.960 --> 30:35.599
pistols for the militaryand law enforcement.

30:35.630 --> 30:37.222
Now, in what is unlikelyto be a coincidence,

30:37.260 --> 30:39.626
all of the individuals

30:39.670 --> 30:41.535
who receivedAlpha Hawk's payments

30:41.570 --> 30:43.902
went on to choosethat company's pistols

30:43.940 --> 30:46.238
as their department'ssidearm of choice.

30:46.270 --> 30:48.602
That would mean a small-townpolice chief from New Jersey

30:48.640 --> 30:50.949
was taking on a weapons companythat was bribing cops

30:50.980 --> 30:52.607
to buy their products.

30:52.650 --> 30:54.868
That would've been way aboveher pay grade, wouldn't it?

30:54.920 --> 30:57.047
I wondered the same thing.

30:57.080 --> 30:58.411
Then I rememberedwhat Righetti said

30:58.450 --> 31:01.954
about Vlasik's recent hardship.

31:01.990 --> 31:03.412
What, the death in her family?

31:03.460 --> 31:05.485
Not her family, precisely.

31:05.530 --> 31:09.022
In February, one of her oldestfriends was shot to death

31:09.060 --> 31:12.666
by her husband in amurder/suicide in Iowa.

31:12.700 --> 31:14.930
This says that her husbandhad a history of mental illness.

31:14.970 --> 31:16.164
Bipolar.

31:16.200 --> 31:19.567
Mm-hmm. Now, according tonasik's social media,

31:19.610 --> 31:23.307
she became quite obsessedwith the recent federal law

31:23.340 --> 31:25.240
which eased restrictionson gun purchases

31:25.280 --> 31:26.679
by the mentally ill.

31:26.710 --> 31:30.646
She felt that it enabled,or at the very least emboldened,

31:30.680 --> 31:32.318
her friend's husband.

31:32.350 --> 31:35.319
Let me guess, Alpha Hawklobbied for the bill.

31:35.360 --> 31:38.386
Mm-hmm. Specifically,their CEO,

31:38.430 --> 31:40.648
Clint Washburn.

31:40.690 --> 31:43.488
So you think he's the one whobribed all those police chiefs

31:43.530 --> 31:44.690
to buy his guns.

31:44.730 --> 31:46.618
He found out that Vlasikwas looking into him

31:46.670 --> 31:48.194
and then had someone kill her?

31:48.240 --> 31:49.639
Mm. Hope toknow more shortly.

31:49.670 --> 31:52.935
I'm due at the stationto speak with Mr. Washburn.

31:52.970 --> 31:54.676
I'll get dressed.

31:54.710 --> 31:56.632
No.

31:56.680 --> 31:58.648
After you dozed off last night,

31:58.680 --> 32:01.114
you received a text messagefrom Shinwell.

32:01.150 --> 32:05.109
Apparently, your recent businessis not finished after all.

32:07.150 --> 32:09.983
(knock at door)Come in.

32:12.060 --> 32:13.948
What's all this?

32:14.000 --> 32:16.719
Moving day.

32:16.760 --> 32:19.024
DaMarco Bridger got arrested.

32:19.070 --> 32:20.662
SBK leadership

32:20.700 --> 32:22.964
offered mehis territory.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.036
That means I'm moving backto the old neighborhood.

32:26.470 --> 32:28.335
You could've told meall this over the phone.

32:28.380 --> 32:30.132
You're right,I could've.

32:30.180 --> 32:32.171
But I wanted togive you something.

32:41.560 --> 32:42.686
What is this?

32:42.720 --> 32:46.019
My confession.

32:46.060 --> 32:48.722
For killing Jameel.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.455
That is everythingthat happened that night

32:50.500 --> 32:52.388
and everything that I did.

32:54.040 --> 32:57.066
I don't understand,why are you giving this to me?

32:57.100 --> 33:00.228
Because his family deservesto know the truth

33:00.270 --> 33:02.079
about what happened.

33:02.110 --> 33:04.203
And me,

33:04.250 --> 33:06.400
I deserve what's coming.

33:06.450 --> 33:09.078
And you think thatneeds to happen soon,

33:09.120 --> 33:11.088
you give that to thepeople you work with,

33:11.120 --> 33:12.712
and they know where to find me.

33:12.750 --> 33:15.787
But I'm telling you,Doc, I'm close.

33:15.820 --> 33:18.550
Couple more monthsand this'll all be over.

33:18.590 --> 33:21.753
SBK and their top brass

33:21.800 --> 33:23.995
will go away forever.

33:25.800 --> 33:29.065
If I give this to the police,you're going away, too.

33:29.100 --> 33:31.261
I didn't do all this because

33:31.310 --> 33:34.029
I wanted to get awaywith what I did.

33:34.080 --> 33:37.277
I did it because I wastrying to make up for it.

33:44.490 --> 33:45.718
I'll be in touch.

33:55.800 --> 33:58.098
WASHBURN :I'm sorry,

33:58.130 --> 34:00.269
I've never seen this womanbefore in my life.

34:00.300 --> 34:01.665
HOLMES:Mr. Washburn,

34:01.700 --> 34:03.338
you make your moneymanufacturing a product

34:03.370 --> 34:05.804
which kills tens of thousandsof Americans every year,

34:05.840 --> 34:08.400
so you'll understand if we don'treadily take you at your word.

34:08.440 --> 34:09.668
I'm not denying

34:09.710 --> 34:11.246
the things yousay she found.

34:11.280 --> 34:14.215
These bank transfers,I authorized all of them.

34:14.250 --> 34:15.842
But she neverapproached me with them.

34:15.880 --> 34:18.542
And, even if she had,it wouldn't have mattered.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.387
BELL: Chief Vlasikuncovered evidence

34:20.420 --> 34:22.411
that you and yourcompany had bribed

34:22.460 --> 34:23.586
dozens of copsacross the country.

34:23.620 --> 34:25.121
You really expect us

34:25.160 --> 34:26.286
to believe you thinkthat's no big deal?

34:26.330 --> 34:28.389
It isn't a big deal

34:28.430 --> 34:31.866
because she wasn't the first oneto figure out what I was doing.

34:31.900 --> 34:35.097
I've already agreed to pleadguilty to all of this.

34:35.140 --> 34:36.869
I beg your pardon?

34:36.900 --> 34:39.539
The U.S. Attorney's officecaught onto me,

34:39.570 --> 34:41.731
like, three years ago,

34:41.780 --> 34:44.374
and they found a lot more casesthan she did.

34:44.410 --> 34:46.708
Okay?We didn't find any prior arrests

34:46.750 --> 34:48.638
when we ran your namethrough the system.

34:48.680 --> 34:50.113
Of course you didn't.

34:50.150 --> 34:52.118
I have powerful friends.

34:52.150 --> 34:54.710
The U.S. Attorney's officedid me the courtesy

34:54.760 --> 34:58.389
of keeping this investigationunder the radar.

34:58.430 --> 35:01.228
They presented me withtheir findings months ago,

35:01.260 --> 35:03.751
my attorney's been working ona plea deal every since.

35:03.800 --> 35:05.893
If you don'tbelieve me, call him.

35:05.930 --> 35:07.158
The final detailsare almost done,

35:07.200 --> 35:09.361
I agreed to a...

35:09.400 --> 35:11.209
$10 million fine, no jail time,

35:11.240 --> 35:15.176
I step down as CEO of Alpha Hawkand start my retirement.

35:15.210 --> 35:17.235
Presumably witha severance package

35:17.280 --> 35:19.578
worth far more than the fineyou're being assessed.

35:19.610 --> 35:22.170
(chuckles softly)

35:22.220 --> 35:23.869
You think I hadthis woman killed

35:23.920 --> 35:25.478
to get away with something,

35:25.520 --> 35:27.181
but that's crazy.

35:27.220 --> 35:29.654
I already got away with it.

35:29.690 --> 35:31.226
BELL: I hate to say it,

35:31.260 --> 35:32.887
but Washburn's plea dealchecks out.

35:32.930 --> 35:35.228
The U.S. Attorney's officeagreed to a fine

35:35.260 --> 35:36.898
with no jail time.

35:36.930 --> 35:39.262
There anything interestingin the case file?

35:39.300 --> 35:40.665
Well, Washburnwas right,

35:40.700 --> 35:42.861
they identified manymore cases of bribery

35:42.900 --> 35:45.209
than V|asik.How many more?

35:45.240 --> 35:47.208
Multiply by ten.

35:47.240 --> 35:48.605
In the plea deal,

35:48.640 --> 35:50.176
do you see any evidencethat the government

35:50.210 --> 35:51.871
confrontedthe policemen involved?

35:51.910 --> 35:54.219
No, looks like they wanted to

35:54.250 --> 35:55.877
secure Washburn'scooperation first,

35:55.920 --> 35:58.411
and kept everything under wraps.

35:58.450 --> 36:00.611
Why, is that important?Extremely.

36:00.650 --> 36:03.619
In fact, you could say thatthe secrecy around the case

36:03.660 --> 36:05.355
led to Vlasik's murder.

36:05.390 --> 36:06.880
Had the killer known

36:06.930 --> 36:08.818
that the federal governmentalready knew his secrets,

36:08.860 --> 36:10.521
he would've had no reasonto kill her.

36:10.560 --> 36:12.721
Are you saying you knowwho killed her?

36:14.000 --> 36:15.661
I have a likely suspect.

36:17.340 --> 36:20.764
Apart from his surpriseappearance in the case file,

36:20.810 --> 36:24.598
we have not a shred ofevidence against him.

36:24.650 --> 36:25.674
But I think I knowwhere we could find some.

36:33.820 --> 36:35.651
DARIA: I don't understand,you want us to help you arrest

36:35.690 --> 36:37.578
Dr. Eriyo again?

36:37.620 --> 36:39.451
When I called the other dayto see if you'd found him,

36:39.490 --> 36:40.457
you said you'dreleased him.

36:40.490 --> 36:42.321
We didn't have enoughevidence to hold him.

36:42.360 --> 36:44.225
HOLMES: Nor did wehave the right motive.

36:44.270 --> 36:46.898
At the time of his questioning,

36:46.930 --> 36:48.693
we thought he'd killedNanette Vlasik

36:48.740 --> 36:49.889
because of Moving Targets'

36:49.940 --> 36:51.737
million-dollar prize,

36:51.770 --> 36:54.739
but he argued quite effectivelythat that wasn't the case.

36:54.780 --> 36:56.372
Well, if it wasn'tfor the money,

36:56.410 --> 36:58.002
then why did he kill Nanette?

36:58.040 --> 37:01.578
To avoid being tried forwar crimes in Uganda.

37:01.620 --> 37:03.838
HOLMES: Dr. Eriyo'sreal name is Akello Akeny.

37:03.880 --> 37:06.781
We believe that Nanettehad uncovered a crime

37:06.820 --> 37:08.287
that he committed

37:08.320 --> 37:09.753
that, if exposed,

37:09.790 --> 37:11.348
would've triggeredhis extradition

37:11.390 --> 37:13.722
and possible execution.

37:13.760 --> 37:15.318
Nanette Vlasik wasinvestigating a gun company

37:15.360 --> 37:16.998
called "Alpha Hawk."

37:17.030 --> 37:19.863
She was looking for evidencethat they'd been bribing cops.

37:19.900 --> 37:22.630
She found it,and a whole lot more.

37:22.670 --> 37:24.706
Alpha Hawk hasalso been engaging

37:24.740 --> 37:26.537
in illegalweapons sales.

37:26.570 --> 37:29.835
One of their customerswas Heaven's Shining Army,

37:29.880 --> 37:31.973
a rebel group in Uganda thatAkeny used to be a part of.

37:32.010 --> 37:34.570
Now, he helpedarrange the sale.

37:34.620 --> 37:36.679
And that's a violationof a treaty the group signed

37:36.720 --> 37:38.585
with the Ugandan government.

37:38.620 --> 37:41.657
Chief Vlasik really hadit in for Alpha Hawk.

37:41.690 --> 37:43.658
We think she enteredyour competition

37:43.690 --> 37:45.055
to get closer to Akeny

37:45.090 --> 37:47.524
and gather more evidenceagainst him.

37:47.560 --> 37:49.050
BELL: What shedidn't realize was

37:49.100 --> 37:50.522
he was scoutinghis opponents

37:50.560 --> 37:51.822
before the gameeven started.

37:51.870 --> 37:54.361
We figured he found outwhat she was up to,

37:54.400 --> 37:56.891
lured her to that abandonedbuilding, and killed her.

37:56.940 --> 37:58.362
GREGSON:Problem is,

37:58.410 --> 38:00.708
we got plenty of motive,we got no proof.

38:00.740 --> 38:03.504
What we really wantis the murder weapon.

38:03.540 --> 38:05.804
I don't see how we canhelp you with that.

38:05.850 --> 38:08.739
BELL: Right now, Akenyis back at his house.

38:08.780 --> 38:09.940
We think he's gotthe weapon there,

38:09.980 --> 38:11.686
but if we showup at his door,

38:11.720 --> 38:12.914
things couldget ugly.

38:15.560 --> 38:16.879
You want us to lure him here.

38:16.920 --> 38:18.922
BELL: Well, wethought you could call

38:18.960 --> 38:20.780
and say that, becausethe game's been called off,

38:20.830 --> 38:22.320
you're gonna dividethe million dollars

38:22.360 --> 38:24.362
among the top-rankingcontestants.

38:24.400 --> 38:26.618
You just need him to comefill out some paperwork.

38:26.670 --> 38:28.535
GREGSON:Once he's in custody,

38:28.570 --> 38:29.969
we can search his placefor the shotgun

38:30.000 --> 38:31.706
used to killed Chief Vlasik.

38:31.740 --> 38:34.436
We find it, case closed.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.368
Okay, but it's late.

38:36.410 --> 38:38.503
I-It'll seem suspiciousif we ask him to come now.

38:38.550 --> 38:40.768
First thing in the morning okay?

38:40.810 --> 38:41.947
Works for us.

39:11.980 --> 39:13.971
(sirens wailing)

39:17.020 --> 39:18.078
BELL: Police!

39:18.120 --> 39:19.678
Put the gun down!

39:20.620 --> 39:22.588
Put your hands up!

39:22.620 --> 39:25.453
Turn around, put yourhands behind your head.

39:32.970 --> 39:34.961
Jake Bozeman,you're under arrest

39:35.000 --> 39:37.560
for the murderof Nanette Vlasik.

39:37.600 --> 39:38.828
(handcuffs click)

39:45.650 --> 39:47.402
You lied to me.

39:47.450 --> 39:51.887
Dr. Eriyo, or Akeny,whatever you want to call him,

39:51.920 --> 39:55.014
he didn't broker a deal betweenAlpha
Hawk and some rebel group.

39:55.060 --> 39:56.880
You're right, we lied;we thought it might tempt you

39:56.920 --> 39:58.956
to plant the gun youused to kill Vlasik

39:58.990 --> 40:00.628
somewhere that mightlink back to him.

40:00.660 --> 40:02.150
BELL:But, hey, you know

40:02.200 --> 40:05.465
the cops don't have to tell thetruth to suspects, don't you?

40:05.500 --> 40:07.764
We didn't realizewhen we first met you

40:07.800 --> 40:08.994
that, prior to yourcareer in television,

40:09.040 --> 40:11.565
you spent 15 yearsas a Texas Ranger.

40:14.040 --> 40:15.871
I assume it was that backgroundthat helped you win the job

40:15.910 --> 40:17.935
as host on Moving Targets.

40:17.980 --> 40:19.538
WATSON: Before you putin your papers in Texas,

40:19.580 --> 40:21.070
one of your last assignments

40:21.110 --> 40:23.112
was to serve on the panelthat chooses the gear

40:23.150 --> 40:25.687
for all ofthe state police, correct?

40:25.720 --> 40:27.449
It's public record.

40:27.490 --> 40:28.912
What's not public record, yet,

40:28.960 --> 40:31.019
is that whileyou were on that panel,

40:31.060 --> 40:34.154
the CEO of Alpha HawkIndustries, Clint Washburn,

40:34.190 --> 40:36.192
paid you hundredsof thousands of dollars

40:36.230 --> 40:38.664
to convince you to buy pistolsfrom his company,

40:38.700 --> 40:41.089
and his company alone.BELL:You pocketed enough money

40:41.130 --> 40:44.099
to quit the Rangers and rollthe dice at a TV career.

40:44.140 --> 40:46.131
But you knew that ifthe truth ever came out,

40:46.170 --> 40:49.139
you'd be looking at someserious prison time.

40:49.180 --> 40:51.000
We're guessing you found outabout Vlasik's investigation

40:51.040 --> 40:53.474
into Alpha Hawk whenyou helped the producers

40:53.510 --> 40:54.738
vet her for the show.

40:54.780 --> 40:56.748
Are we rightabout that,

40:56.780 --> 40:58.714
or did you find outsome other way?

40:58.750 --> 41:00.911
BELL:The saddest thing is,

41:00.950 --> 41:03.851
if you had known the U.S.Attorney's office was onto you,

41:03.890 --> 41:05.778
you might've let her live.

41:05.830 --> 41:09.698
Since you didn't, you broughta shotgun to a paintball fight.

41:12.270 --> 41:14.693
I'd like a lawyer now.

41:19.310 --> 41:21.232
Guy like that,

41:21.270 --> 41:23.033
using the job toline his own pockets,

41:23.080 --> 41:25.605
I almost wish he hadn'tput down his gun tonight.

41:25.650 --> 41:27.902
Might wish thathimself soon enough.

41:27.950 --> 41:30.510
He's a former lawmanand a TV personality;(phone chimes)

41:30.550 --> 41:32.745
