Previously on Ninjago...

00:02.102 --> 00:03.934
Previously on Ninjago...

00:04.371 --> 00:07.671
The only way to slow a Djinn
is with the venom of a Tiger Widow.

00:07.841 --> 00:11.641
We could bust outta here tonight,
and take Soto with us.

00:12.713 --> 00:13.703
To Djinjago!

00:13.881 --> 00:15.110
What is happening?

00:15.282 --> 00:16.807
Take the Sword of Souls.

00:17.251 --> 00:19.686
The Ninja will pay.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:51.919 --> 00:53.648
Find me those Ninja!

00:53.887 --> 00:57.517
They can't just break out of Kryptarium
and completely disappear.

00:57.691 --> 01:00.217
I want witnesses, I want locations!

01:00.394 --> 01:02.658
These fugitives are Ninja, people.

01:02.829 --> 01:06.356
They could be right under our noses
for all we know!

01:07.167 --> 01:09.534
All right,
I'm in their secured network,

01:09.836 --> 01:11.326
<i>but I still need that password.</i>

01:12.139 --> 01:14.471
I'm looking for it now,
but I don't get it.

01:14.641 --> 01:17.736
Why do we have to hack into their system
when we already have a Nindroid?

01:17.945 --> 01:20.471
Because Nindroids don't know everything

01:20.647 --> 01:24.777
and if Soto says the map to the only thing
that can stop Nadakhan is on his ship,

01:24.952 --> 01:26.181
we need to find it,

01:27.220 --> 01:28.415
and find it fast.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.580
Hey, real fast, what's the password again?

01:30.757 --> 01:32.953
The password is, "Password".

01:33.126 --> 01:35.390
- Got that?
- That worked.

01:35.696 --> 01:39.189
Now searching city records for
the last known whereabouts of his ship,

01:39.366 --> 01:40.663
<i>Keep.</i>

01:40.834 --> 01:44.566
Speaking of which-- Hey Kai,
how's Destiny's Bounty holding up?

01:44.738 --> 01:47.764
I got my eyes on it now, sis.
We sure could use it.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.535
Ow! Careful, Zane. It's electrified.

01:50.944 --> 01:55.040
I believe all of the signs on this
repo yard made that abundantly clear.

01:56.583 --> 02:00.417
Perhaps there's another suitable solution
past this obstacle. Airjitzu?

02:01.888 --> 02:04.289
You don't have to sound so cocky.

02:11.598 --> 02:15.296
Looks like we have some trespassers.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.597
Go get 'em, Sir Chomps-Alot.

02:17.804 --> 02:20.273
Okay, I've located Nadakhan's ship.

02:20.474 --> 02:23.068
<i>It was last recorded
to</i> be <i>seen in Gypsy</i> Cove,

02:23.243 --> 02:25.507
three clicks north of Cannon Beach.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.443
Thanks, Delara-- Oh, I mean, Nya.

02:27.614 --> 02:28.809
Not funny!

02:28.982 --> 02:32.077
<i>Let's see how you like it
when you look like our enemy's sweetheart.</i>

02:32.252 --> 02:33.777
Gypsy Cove isn't far.

02:33.954 --> 02:36.582
We'll let you know what we see
when we get there.

02:40.193 --> 02:42.719
- Would ya hurry up?
- These chains will take me a while.

02:42.896 --> 02:46.924
You could keep interrupting me,
or perhaps start making yourself useful.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.668
Get away, get away, get away!

03:02.649 --> 03:04.777
Trespasser! Don't move!

03:09.022 --> 03:10.649
I told you to hurry up!

03:10.824 --> 03:12.349
Would you be quiet and run?

03:16.296 --> 03:19.596
Well, if you can't get it,
for my sake just get outta there, you two.

03:19.766 --> 03:22.292
Get outta here?
But we just got here.

03:22.469 --> 03:24.233
Not you, Cole.

03:24.404 --> 03:25.838
Did you find Nadakhan's ship?

03:26.106 --> 03:29.041
Not exactly.
But there is evidence of it.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.644
Looks like some repairs were made.

03:31.812 --> 03:36.750
But this is strange, what is electrical
wiring doing on an old pirate ship?

03:36.917 --> 03:38.783
Maybe it's already set off to sea?

03:38.952 --> 03:41.284
I'm getting no readings of it anywhere.

03:41.455 --> 03:44.322
You'd think a big pirate ship
would get someone's attention.

03:44.524 --> 03:49.223
<i>If Nadakhan's ship's not here,
and it's not out there, where is it?</i>

03:49.396 --> 03:50.864
Good question.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.862
What's a good question?

03:53.767 --> 03:55.792
Question is, "What time's lunch?"

03:56.336 --> 03:58.202
All this searching is making me hungry.

03:58.505 --> 04:01.372
You're right.
We can't think on an empty stomach.

04:01.541 --> 04:03.031
We'll resume after lunch.

04:18.458 --> 04:23.487
You always were seasick, Clancee,
but I never pegged you to be airsick!

04:23.663 --> 04:26.360
Trim the sails! Tighten the halyard!

04:39.880 --> 04:40.938
What is it?

04:41.148 --> 04:43.742
Uh, the crew and I
have kept our mouths shut,

04:43.917 --> 04:46.818
but you still haven't told us
about your plan.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.547
You need to trust your captain.

04:49.756 --> 04:52.555
Yourjob is to control the ship,

04:52.726 --> 04:55.354
which you seem to be failing at.

04:55.595 --> 04:59.361
My job is to catch the Ninja
so that the Sword of Souls

04:59.566 --> 05:02.297
is powerful enough to do our bidding.

05:02.469 --> 05:05.996
I'm sorry Cap'n.
I'll have this ship steady in no time.

05:06.606 --> 05:08.005
I said steady the ship!

05:08.208 --> 05:09.198
<i>Wens)</i>

05:09.409 --> 05:11.639
You never doubted me, Delara.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.209
Any news?

05:14.447 --> 05:16.814
Still no sign of the Ninja, Cap'n.

05:16.983 --> 05:19.782
It's like they've disappeared off the map.

05:19.953 --> 05:23.548
Well then, maybe I'll see what progress

05:23.723 --> 05:27.421
the so-called police
are making in their search.

05:30.397 --> 05:33.492
I really wish
he'd warn us when he did that.

05:35.168 --> 05:38.570
Fly over the mountain, not into it!

05:38.772 --> 05:41.537
What do you mean,
"The rudder can only turn left or right?"

05:41.708 --> 05:44.507
What kind of airship can't go up or down?

05:51.184 --> 05:56.020
Let me take care of that. A gentleman,
I mean, a superior always pays.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.221
Whoops.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.459
- Wrong pants.
- Here.

06:01.628 --> 06:03.255
This should cover the both of us.

06:21.915 --> 06:25.613
It really is you, Delara.

06:25.852 --> 06:29.152
If I had a dime
for every time I was broke...

06:29.422 --> 06:30.412
<i>wens)</i>

06:30.690 --> 06:33.751
- What did I say?
- I expect it from others, but not you.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.589
What? Can't I try and buy
lunch for a friend?

06:36.763 --> 06:39.425
But I know
you don't just see me as a friend.

06:39.866 --> 06:43.996
All week you've made it pretty obvious
you're still harboring some feelings.

06:44.271 --> 06:45.830
I've tried to ignore it, but...

06:46.006 --> 06:48.065
It's 'cause I'm from ajunkyard, isn't it?

06:48.241 --> 06:49.936
<i>NYA". Of course not.</i>

06:50.310 --> 06:52.836
We're friends. Good friends.

06:53.780 --> 06:56.442
But that's all we are.

06:56.616 --> 06:59.108
And that's all we're ever gonna be.

06:59.819 --> 07:03.881
Look, I'm already the girl Ninja.

07:04.057 --> 07:07.652
But my role on the team
shouldn't be defined by who I'm seeing,

07:07.827 --> 07:09.386
but who I am fighting.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.527
<i>I</i> get it.

07:11.698 --> 07:14.668
A real friend
wouldn't put you in that position.

07:14.834 --> 07:16.063
I'm sorry, Nya.

07:16.236 --> 07:18.398
Thank you for understanding.

07:18.872 --> 07:21.136
And you don't have to pay me back.

07:21.308 --> 07:25.211
Can't a friend buy
lunch for a friend? Hug?

07:25.378 --> 07:26.504
How about a fist bump?

07:26.746 --> 07:27.872
Oh. Um...

07:28.181 --> 07:31.344
Look at that. I guess lunch <i>is</i> on me.

07:31.818 --> 07:33.718
Excuse me
while I find a place to clean this off.

07:33.954 --> 07:37.857
So she has another suitor.

07:38.325 --> 07:40.726
You're such a dork, Jay.

07:40.894 --> 07:43.864
You see one glimpse into the future
of you and Nya together,

07:44.030 --> 07:46.158
and expect everything to fall into line.

07:46.499 --> 07:48.297
I wish I never saw my future.

07:49.869 --> 07:53.430
You want the girl. I can make this happen.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.506
Nadakhan!

07:55.675 --> 07:57.734
Oh, no, we weren't supposed to be alone.

07:57.911 --> 08:01.905
Why, when I can offer your heart's desire?

08:02.082 --> 08:03.743
Because people disappear
when you're around!

08:03.917 --> 08:06.352
Nya's right over there.
I can scream, you know?

08:06.519 --> 08:09.489
Well, I guess she'll never be yours.

08:09.656 --> 08:13.615
Wait. Uh, I thought one of the rules
was that I couldn't wish for love.

08:13.793 --> 08:19.357
True. But there are other ways
to get what you want.

08:20.133 --> 08:25.833
Then again, I guess a poor boy
from ajunkyard wouldn't understand.

08:26.239 --> 08:29.834
Well, I guess one little wish
wouldn't hurt.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.671
But no one else would find out, right?

08:31.845 --> 08:35.509
- This stays between you and me.
- Of course. Cross my heart.

08:35.682 --> 08:38.947
Okay, then I wish...

08:39.119 --> 08:40.883
I wish I wasn't born in ajunkyard.

08:41.054 --> 08:45.116
I wish I wasn't poor anymore
and could give Nya everything she wants.

08:45.291 --> 08:48.784
Your wish is yours to keep.

08:52.932 --> 08:56.368
Oh, there you are. I've been looking
all over Ninjago for you.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.130
Don't worry,
I won't report you to the authorities.

08:59.305 --> 09:00.431
Just delivering the mail.

09:02.509 --> 09:06.605
I'm sorry to inform you
but your father has passed.

09:06.780 --> 09:11.980
You have inherited his estate
and lots and lots and lots of money.

09:12.752 --> 09:15.414
Why the glum face? You're rich!

09:25.298 --> 09:28.199
No! Dad?

09:28.368 --> 09:30.530
Mom? Dad? Mom?

09:31.071 --> 09:34.803
Ooh, what is it, son? What's all the fuss?

09:35.175 --> 09:36.836
Where's Dad? ls he okay?

09:37.343 --> 09:41.541
Oh, I'm sorry, Jay, he's no longer here.

09:44.050 --> 09:45.313
<i>Yeah, I'm back!</i>

09:45.485 --> 09:47.476
Picked up a few diddlybops.

09:47.654 --> 09:49.782
Jay, what a welcome sight!

09:50.056 --> 09:51.922
I thought I lost you!

09:52.125 --> 09:55.459
I got this letter that said my father
passed away and I inherited lots of money.

09:55.628 --> 09:57.392
I would never wish for this, Dad.

09:57.564 --> 09:58.861
I didn't want it to be true!

09:59.732 --> 10:04.260
Well, Jay, there has been something
we've been meaning to tell you...

10:05.305 --> 10:06.329
<i>wens)</i>

10:06.573 --> 10:11.409
But gee willikers, there was just
no easy way to say it.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.376
<i>You see, son... You're, uh...</i>

10:14.547 --> 10:15.878
<i>You're adopted.</i>

10:16.149 --> 10:18.208
Uh... Ooh...

10:18.518 --> 10:21.488
Oh, you were left at our doorstep
when you were just a <i>baby,</i>

10:21.654 --> 10:24.055
along with this address and key.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.488
You were just so gosh darn cute.

10:26.659 --> 10:29.993
And we gladly raised you
as our own ever since.

10:32.832 --> 10:37.895
We're sorry, son.
I hope this doesn't change anything.

10:44.744 --> 10:45.836
Whoa.

10:46.112 --> 10:48.103
Is this where my birth father lived?

10:51.751 --> 10:52.843
Whoa.

10:58.925 --> 10:59.915
Wow.

11:00.593 --> 11:03.358
Fear isn't a word where <i>I</i> come from.

11:03.530 --> 11:04.793
Would you look at that?

11:04.964 --> 11:07.990
My father was a fan
of Fritz Donnegan too. Heh, cool.

11:08.268 --> 11:11.238
Wow. He had so many trophies.

11:23.583 --> 11:26.575
My father wasn't just a fan
of Fritz Donnegan,

11:26.953 --> 11:28.853
he was Fritz Donnegan!

11:38.698 --> 11:41.929
<i>Cliff Gordon's Handbook to Wooing Women?</i>

11:42.135 --> 11:44.502
That must be his real name. Cliff Gordon.

11:45.638 --> 11:49.268
That means my real name is Jay Gordon!

11:49.876 --> 11:51.241
"Chapter One.

11:51.411 --> 11:55.314
"Women love mystery.
When talking to them, less is more..."

11:57.150 --> 12:00.017
<i>Are you ready for your second wish?</i>

12:01.854 --> 12:03.913
- Adorable.
- What did you do?

12:04.090 --> 12:05.683
Did you change the past?

12:05.858 --> 12:07.519
I Wish.

12:07.694 --> 12:12.632
I merely revealed a truth about your life
that you were unaware of.

12:12.799 --> 12:14.426
Then I don't wanna make another wish.

12:14.601 --> 12:17.229
Everyone wants a second wish.

12:17.403 --> 12:21.101
A second chance to make things right...

12:21.274 --> 12:24.904
- No.
- Don't resist me, tell me what you want.

12:25.078 --> 12:28.275
More power? More prestige?

12:28.448 --> 12:30.507
Maybe a ray gun that works?

12:30.683 --> 12:32.412
No, I don't want anything.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.077
I just wish I wasn't alone with you!

12:38.358 --> 12:42.022
- Dang it! Oh! I did it again.
- Hello? Jay? You here?

12:42.195 --> 12:45.392
Don't forget you have a third wish.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.668
- Hello?
- Nya, you're here.

12:53.840 --> 12:57.071
- How did you get here?
- After you split, I got worried.

12:57.243 --> 12:59.610
I called your dad who said you'd be here.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.271
Speaking of which, why are you here?

13:02.515 --> 13:04.540
Uh... Uh...

13:04.951 --> 13:09.047
<i>Women love mystery.
When talking to them, less is more.</i>

13:09.322 --> 13:10.483
Hmm.

13:10.823 --> 13:13.019
Fear isn't a word where <i>I</i> come from.

13:13.192 --> 13:16.162
Fritz Donnegan? ls this your stuff?

13:16.329 --> 13:18.388
If you have a secret hideout, why can't I?

13:18.665 --> 13:22.932
Wow! I never would have guessed.

13:23.102 --> 13:24.934
Come on. The team needs us.

13:25.104 --> 13:28.597
Don't worry,
this place will be our little secret.

13:29.776 --> 13:32.404
Fear isn't a word where <i>I</i> come from.

13:32.612 --> 13:34.910
Thanks, Dad. I owe you one.

13:38.117 --> 13:41.485
I ain't tryin' to do your job,
I'm just tryin' to help.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.216
Hey, that better be mud!

13:46.259 --> 13:49.024
So, did you snare a Ninja?

13:49.195 --> 13:52.790
Unfortunately, it didn't go as planned.

13:52.965 --> 13:54.524
If I can speak freely,

13:54.701 --> 13:57.966
you ain't gettin' them alone
'cause they ain't got nothin' to do

13:58.137 --> 13:59.627
but look out for each other.

13:59.872 --> 14:02.068
I don't follow.

14:02.241 --> 14:03.709
Put us to work, Cap'n.

14:03.876 --> 14:07.176
Then when they're busy
lookin' out for their own tails,

14:07.347 --> 14:09.441
they're all yours for the takin'.

14:09.816 --> 14:13.980
There's a reason
I made you my first mate.

14:14.153 --> 14:19.091
Let's welcome back the rest of my old crew
and get this bird in the sky.

14:25.064 --> 14:26.691
I'm so tired of all this sneaking around!

14:26.866 --> 14:30.063
Easy, Kai, we're all itching
to get back into action.

14:30.236 --> 14:32.603
But so far two of our own
have gone missing,

14:32.772 --> 14:34.866
and none of us
have yet to lay an eye on him.

14:35.041 --> 14:37.976
If only we knew someone who had faced him,
and could tell us what to expect.

14:38.144 --> 14:40.613
- I wish Wu were here to guide us.
- No! Don't say that word!

14:43.449 --> 14:47.079
I mean, why wish when we have
everything we need right here, right?

14:47.286 --> 14:48.754
Ha-ha. Go Ninja go?

14:50.890 --> 14:52.415
Nice goin', you blew our cover.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.354
No, he didn't...

14:54.527 --> 14:56.086
<i>(ON TV]
I dunno why this is news anymore,</i>

14:56.262 --> 14:59.562
but Ninjago City's once again
under attack <i>by</i> pirates.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.133
<i>Or dare I say, Sky Pirates?</i>

15:02.335 --> 15:04.667
- We have to help!
- But we're fugitives.

15:04.837 --> 15:07.329
Doesn't matter. We protect the innocent.

15:07.507 --> 15:09.874
And Soto said the map is on that ship.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.238
<i>If we want to stop Nadakhan, we need it.</i>

15:12.412 --> 15:13.607
<i>KAY. Well, what are we waiting for?</i>

15:13.946 --> 15:16.381
I thought we were all itching
to get back into action.

15:18.785 --> 15:21.914
<i>Pull your flying vehicle over now!</i>

15:31.864 --> 15:34.629
It's been too long, Cap'n.

15:34.834 --> 15:37.826
It has, hasn't it, Clancee?

15:44.277 --> 15:46.905
So they finally fixed our offices...

15:48.281 --> 15:50.340
Oh, great, not again!

15:57.690 --> 16:00.318
For our own safety, travel in pairs.

16:00.493 --> 16:03.463
We need to protect the people,
but also get that map.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.393
I forgot, what does the map look like?

16:05.565 --> 16:07.624
It's on a lantern. Look for a lantern.

16:09.001 --> 16:11.333
NINJAAAA-GO!

16:12.138 --> 16:15.335
Protect the people, Commissioner.
We'll take care of the menace.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.076
Why didn't you arrest 'em?

16:18.244 --> 16:19.837
It sounds like they were trying to help.

16:20.012 --> 16:22.481
You might be soft. But I'm not!

16:25.785 --> 16:28.652
Well, who knew
the Commish was so nimble?

16:35.394 --> 16:36.623
That is not cool.

16:36.896 --> 16:39.126
But this is! Ice!

16:41.667 --> 16:43.192
Now it's my turn.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.313
Boy, you're real ugly.

16:57.483 --> 17:00.578
I'm not a boy, I'm a lady!

17:11.030 --> 17:12.998
So he knows Spinjitzu!

17:13.165 --> 17:14.826
Let's see if he knows Airjitzu!

17:17.537 --> 17:20.336
Forget him, we need to get that lantern!

17:25.444 --> 17:26.809
Look out!

17:30.449 --> 17:33.282
- I'm okay.
- l'm going after that lantern.

17:33.452 --> 17:36.114
Wait, we're supposed to stay together!

17:51.938 --> 17:54.532
No! Kai!

17:56.275 --> 17:57.800
Where are we? What did you do?

17:58.077 --> 18:01.411
I thought
a little privacy might be in order.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.573
You were in such a rush. For what?

18:05.451 --> 18:09.410
Let me help you, you can wish for it.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.853
The only thing I wish
is for you to take me back!

18:12.024 --> 18:15.050
Your wish is yours to keep.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.825
This isn't Ninjago City.

18:18.998 --> 18:21.695
This isn't my wish.
I told you to take me back.

18:22.068 --> 18:24.594
Ah, but how far back?

18:25.171 --> 18:27.230
This is Ninjago City.

18:27.406 --> 18:31.570
Dare I say, the humble beginnings of it.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.944
<i>Wait a minute, is that...</i>

18:35.114 --> 18:37.742
<i>NADAKHAN". Your father? Yes.</i>

18:37.917 --> 18:41.046
<i>I</i> believe he <i>is</i> around your age now.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.914
A little more pathetic.

18:45.424 --> 18:47.688
Well, pirate activity is on the rise.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.557
Protect yourself
with a custom-made weapon that--

18:54.834 --> 18:55.960
A little help?

18:56.235 --> 18:58.397
This isn't what I wished for.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.938
Why won't you help your poor father?

19:01.140 --> 19:05.134
He's right there.
You could spend some quality time.

19:05.311 --> 19:07.245
Please friend, I just need a hand.

19:07.580 --> 19:08.809
Dad?

19:14.253 --> 19:17.279
I wish you to take me back,
back to when things were good,

19:17.490 --> 19:20.187
back to before all this mess
when people liked us,

19:20.359 --> 19:22.521
and bad guys like you
were never a problem.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.627
Back to the days
when girls were crazy for me...

19:24.797 --> 19:27.767
Your wish is yours to keep.

19:29.402 --> 19:31.564
Where is everyone? I said that...

19:31.737 --> 19:33.569
You said a lot for one wish.

19:33.739 --> 19:35.867
Too much to make any sense.

19:36.375 --> 19:40.005
But the girls are crazy for you.

19:42.982 --> 19:43.972
Kai!

19:47.353 --> 19:48.377
Kai!

19:49.789 --> 19:50.779
Kai!

20:07.907 --> 20:09.272
Bad monkey!

20:10.242 --> 20:13.177
Now, where is the lantern?
It's got to be here somewhere.

20:18.984 --> 20:21.385
I ain't afraid to shoot ya in the back.

20:35.134 --> 20:36.124
Ha!

20:38.237 --> 20:39.727
You shot the Realm Crystal!

20:39.905 --> 20:41.236
Well, you made me miss!

20:47.813 --> 20:49.440
I got it. Let's get outta here!

21:07.233 --> 21:09.861
Argh!
This is not what I wished for!

21:10.035 --> 21:12.561
You have one more wish.

21:12.738 --> 21:17.335
AH' of this can <i>go</i> away
if you just say the words.

21:17.510 --> 21:18.978
Just wish it away...

21:19.145 --> 21:21.273
- Kai!
- And be done with it all.

21:21.447 --> 21:25.543
Okay! Okay! Make them stop!
I wish for it all to go away!

21:25.751 --> 21:29.244
Your wish is yours to keep.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.283
Did you...

21:35.461 --> 21:39.591
Yes, we got what we came for. Let's go.

21:43.569 --> 21:46.539
You heard the Cap'n! Air ho!

21:47.473 --> 21:49.908
We've got the lantern!
Return to the meeting point!

21:50.075 --> 21:51.634
Hi guys, I'm almost there.

21:51.811 --> 21:55.213
Freeze! Don't test me, Lloyd Garmadon!

21:55.414 --> 21:57.883
You know we're only trying to help.

21:58.083 --> 22:01.383
If you don't believe me, pull the trigger.

22:03.889 --> 22:08.292
Oh, darn Ninja!
I hate it when you're right.

22:10.129 --> 22:13.360
All right, now let's fire this lantern up
and check out the map.

22:13.532 --> 22:14.829
Kai, a little light?

22:16.202 --> 22:18.466
- Kai?
- Where's Kai?

22:18.704 --> 22:19.694
Uh...

22:20.039 --> 22:21.905
Who was supposed to...

22:22.708 --> 22:27.202
- What was that?
- I don't know. But I'm afraid to find out.

22:30.616 --> 22:33.210
<i>REPO MAN". What's wrong, Sir Chomps-Alot?</i>

22:33.552 --> 22:35.850
Someone gettin' at that ship again?

22:36.288 --> 22:41.089
What in tarnation happened to Ninjago?

22:57.309 --> 22:58.299
