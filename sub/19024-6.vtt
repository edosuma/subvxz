00:01.320 --> 00:04.392
Even close friends
disagree about decisions.

00:04.480 --> 00:07.233
- This one?
- You want a clear shower curtain?

00:07.320 --> 00:09.959
Just nude up
in the living room and spray me down.

00:10.040 --> 00:14.238
If you're self-conscious I can doodle in
chest hairs where you'd stand.

00:14.320 --> 00:17.118
I have a chest hair. I named him Clancy.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.794
- And then it happened.
- Can I help you, sir?

00:24.640 --> 00:27.598
- Can't believe she called me sir.
- She called me mister.

00:27.680 --> 00:31.275
- Maybe it's because you're bald.
- I'm not bald. I shave my head.

00:31.360 --> 00:33.828
- Well, then let it grow back.
- Careful, honey.

00:34.880 --> 00:36.393
We're practically kids.

00:36.480 --> 00:38.596
What you doing
for Halloween tomorrow?

00:38.680 --> 00:41.319
We used to dress up as pigs
and hit every bar in town.

00:41.400 --> 00:44.870
You have not lived until
you've seen a drunken pig do the robot.

00:47.200 --> 00:50.192
Not what you used to do,
what you're doing this Halloween.

00:50.280 --> 00:51.759
- We got plans.
- Big plans.

00:51.840 --> 00:53.990
- Watch TV and sleep.
- Yeah, pretty much.

00:54.080 --> 00:56.594
- I may take a bath first.
- Bubbles?

00:56.680 --> 00:59.240
Give me some.

00:59.840 --> 01:03.355
It was sad cos I was starting to
think I'd never feel like a kid again.

01:04.319 --> 01:07.471
Hey, little brother!
It's the headlocking Dan.

01:07.560 --> 01:10.120
- What are you doing here?
- It's funny, Vivian.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.714
I was about to ask you
the same question,

01:12.800 --> 01:16.236
seeing as I paged you four minutes
and 38 seconds ago.

01:16.320 --> 01:18.754
My big brother Dan.
He showed up unexpected.

01:18.840 --> 01:22.992
- Four minutes and 44 seconds.
- Easy there, Chief.

01:23.080 --> 01:26.550
Have one of those nurses pour you
a big glass of calm-down juice.

01:28.640 --> 01:31.632
It's so interesting,
I found I couldn't sleep last night,

01:31.720 --> 01:36.589
so to pass the time, I made a list of
things that annoy me more than you.

01:36.680 --> 01:40.753
I came up with people
who call Wednesdays "hump day."

01:40.840 --> 01:43.070
and, of course,
all Sandra Bullock movies.

01:43.160 --> 01:45.958
Now I'm thrilled to announce,
your brother tops...

01:46.040 --> 01:50.272
Chief, does this speech have an
intermission? I got to take a whizz.

01:50.360 --> 01:56.390
Actually, I'm not so keen on nicknames
from guys that barely know me.

01:56.480 --> 01:59.995
Actually, why don't you tell me
what you are keen on?

02:00.080 --> 02:02.799
- Oh, Dan, no.
- Where's the crapper?

02:04.800 --> 02:06.119
What brings you to town?

02:06.200 --> 02:09.032
Some guy hired me to fly here,
drive his Mercedes back.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.076
It's an easy way
to pick up extra cash.

02:11.160 --> 02:14.516
- Plus you get to hang out with Bambi.
- Maybe he'll let that go.

02:14.600 --> 02:15.874
Bambi?

02:15.960 --> 02:18.793
- It's a term only Carla uses.
- I respect that, Bambi.

02:18.880 --> 02:23.317
Smart. You do not want to get on his
bad side and suffer the wrath of Bambi.

02:23.400 --> 02:24.879
Why are you here?

02:24.960 --> 02:29.192
Room 31 0's tests came back negative. I
thought you'd want to give him the news.

02:29.280 --> 02:30.872
- Let me do it.
- What?

02:30.960 --> 02:33.190
- I can be a doctor.
- I can't let you tell him.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.271
I won't call you Bambi anymore.

02:36.400 --> 02:39.631
It was touch and go.
You're a fighter. You pulled through.

02:39.720 --> 02:42.996
We'll get you out of here today.
Keep an eye on those rickles.

02:43.080 --> 02:46.117
- Rickles is my last name.
- You bet it is. Do you have kids?

02:46.200 --> 02:47.918
- Two.
- That's what I'm saying.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.878
Watch the little Rickles.
Children are our future.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.518
Doctor, we need you.

02:52.600 --> 02:58.357
Bambi, I'm busy. It's hard to find a
good male nurse these days. Am I right?

03:00.000 --> 03:06.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

03:11.800 --> 03:16.351
Dan wasn't just the captain of every
team. He was the mayor of high school.

03:16.440 --> 03:18.795
The jocks dug him,
the burn-outs dug him,

03:18.880 --> 03:21.235
- the nerds worshipped him.
- What about you?

03:21.320 --> 03:23.151
- He mentioned nerds.
- Why hurt me?

03:23.240 --> 03:25.117
I thought I'd be cool
in high school,

03:25.200 --> 03:28.749
then my dad made me play the tuba
and I developed massive forearms.

03:28.840 --> 03:32.992
Half-way through the prom, my gloves
exploded like I was the lncredible Hulk.

03:33.080 --> 03:36.709
It's sexy to dance with a woman
who can lift her partner over her head.

03:36.800 --> 03:40.509
It's nice when your friends and family
click. It makes you feel like...

03:40.600 --> 03:43.194
Wait a second, is she still laughing?

03:59.600 --> 04:02.592
Stop your laughing.
It makes you look like a whore!

04:05.040 --> 04:06.871
Joking.

04:06.960 --> 04:09.520
I appreciate everything
you did for my husband.

04:09.600 --> 04:12.239
The funeral's tomorrow.
I'd love if you attended.

04:12.320 --> 04:16.233
Unfortunately, I'm in surgery all day.
But, I'm sorry for your loss.

04:18.120 --> 04:20.588
Dodging the funeral? Nice.

04:20.680 --> 04:21.795
Excuse me?

04:21.880 --> 04:25.190
Just a veteran move from
the baby-faced sophomore.

04:25.280 --> 04:28.955
The whole "I'm sorry for your loss"
thing was a little Hallmarky,

04:29.040 --> 04:32.510
but darn it all if you're not showing
just a ton of promise.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.750
If I could be there, I'd be there.

04:34.840 --> 04:40.517
Wait a second. You treated him, right?
So you should want to go too. Right?

04:40.600 --> 04:42.272
Gandhi, for your information,

04:42.360 --> 04:45.955
I attended that vegetable's funeral
every time I set foot in his room

04:46.040 --> 04:48.031
over the last six weeks.

04:48.120 --> 04:50.680
Thank God the family
moved him to surgery

04:50.760 --> 04:55.629
where you guys were good enough to help
him kick that nasty oxygen habit he had.

04:55.720 --> 04:57.438
That's great. Make jokes.

04:57.520 --> 05:00.876
I wish I could be an insensitive,
cynical robodoc like you,

05:00.960 --> 05:03.599
but unfortunately,
I don't hate the world enough.

05:03.680 --> 05:05.671
You know what I'm saying, Chief?

05:07.920 --> 05:10.753
Would people please
stop calling me Chief?

05:10.840 --> 05:12.512
Hey, numbnuts.

05:13.320 --> 05:16.915
Dan, remember when we were kids
and every Halloween you used to try

05:17.000 --> 05:18.752
and scare the crap out of me?

05:21.880 --> 05:23.233
I remember that.

05:23.320 --> 05:27.472
So while I'm here
we should play some frisbee golf,

05:27.560 --> 05:32.156
maybe give Dad a call, and make sure
I sleep with that Elliot chick.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.674
That's a little weird for me cos...

05:34.760 --> 05:37.957
I don't know if you know this...
but, we used to be intimate.

05:38.040 --> 05:40.634
Intimate? What did you do? Bathe her?

05:40.720 --> 05:43.518
Yeah, once,
but she was wearing a swimsuit.

05:43.600 --> 05:47.036
I'll back off. It's gonna be tough.
She sounds kind of wild.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.313
Can't teach it.

05:52.720 --> 05:57.953
You got an opposable thumb.
You can use it. God, I hate Halloween.

05:58.040 --> 06:01.237
Somebody needs to adjust their attitude
if they want candy.

06:01.320 --> 06:04.949
You mean the popcorn balls
and the deformed lollipops?

06:05.040 --> 06:07.270
Honestly, where do you get
this crap?

06:07.360 --> 06:13.310
I made it. If you want name-brand candy,
my fist is packed with peanuts.

06:13.400 --> 06:14.992
Of course it is.

06:15.080 --> 06:17.275
Did Raggedy Ann scare you?

06:17.360 --> 06:19.828
What are you, a rat?

06:19.920 --> 06:22.593
- Don't listen to him.
- I never do.

06:22.680 --> 06:25.877
Dr Cox, your intern asked for
a surgical consult on Mr Carney.

06:25.960 --> 06:28.190
- Yeah.
- I suggest you do a fem-pop bypass.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.077
Mr Carney's a frail old man

06:30.160 --> 06:33.038
who'd probably snap in half
from a light sponge bath.

06:33.120 --> 06:36.430
If we do surgery,
we could improve his quality of life.

06:36.520 --> 06:39.478
The guy's 1,000. Is he gonna take
a steamer over to Europe

06:39.560 --> 06:43.348
open a cafÃ© and finally meet that
900-year-old girl of his dreams?

06:43.440 --> 06:44.998
I've made my recommendation.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.799
You stood up for what you
believe in. I respect that.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.950
- 20 bucks says you kill him.
- You're on.

06:50.040 --> 06:51.473
You got it, baby.

06:54.640 --> 06:57.154
I need some sugar over here.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.877
Can anyone tell me

07:01.960 --> 07:05.953
the dermatologic condition
associated with Rhinophyma? Dr Murphy?

07:06.040 --> 07:08.759
Could it be psoriasis?

07:08.840 --> 07:12.833
And yet further proof
that the clown costume is redundant.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.510
If any of you other would-be revellers
get the urge to dress up

07:17.600 --> 07:20.398
on this, the mother of all non-holidays,

07:20.480 --> 07:24.314
please consider me the razor blade
in your caramel apple.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.550
We're professionals, damn it!

07:27.720 --> 07:30.917
You know, it's nothing personal, son,

07:31.000 --> 07:33.230
you just make me sick.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.953
He called me son!

07:37.040 --> 07:38.393
Score.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.875
You going to lunch with your brother?

07:41.960 --> 07:45.669
Yeah, I would've invited you,
but I made the reservation for two.

07:45.760 --> 07:48.752
- So change it.
- I'm not gonna mess with that hostess.

07:48.840 --> 07:51.354
- She uses sharp tones.
- Yeah, right.

07:51.440 --> 07:55.991
Three seconds to give me the real reason
I can't come, or I'm coming.

07:56.080 --> 07:59.595
Three, two, one.

08:01.600 --> 08:05.115
Because I need special time
with my brother.

08:05.200 --> 08:06.872
- Trick.
- Excuse me?

08:06.960 --> 08:10.839
I figure you got to be wondering
am I gonna get a trick

08:10.920 --> 08:12.911
or am I gonna get a treat?

08:14.160 --> 08:16.515
- You'll be getting a trick.
- Whatever.

08:16.600 --> 08:19.751
It'll be fast
and you won't even know it's me.

08:19.840 --> 08:24.311
- You just told me it was gonna be you.
- You'll still have your doubts.

08:24.400 --> 08:27.710
The best part is
you're gonna be nervous all day about it

08:27.800 --> 08:31.110
cos it could happen at any time.

08:32.159 --> 08:34.150
Like now!

08:34.240 --> 08:37.073
That wasn't it. Fun, though.

08:38.159 --> 08:39.957
False alarm, boys.

08:41.360 --> 08:44.432
All right. Here we go, Mr Carney.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.916
Dr Wen, I want you to stay focused.
I want Dr Wen to be Dr Zen, man.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.834
Christopher, after 1 5 years
and over 1 0,000 surgeries,

08:55.920 --> 08:57.558
I can do without the pep talk.

08:57.640 --> 08:59.915
Message received, sir.

09:01.880 --> 09:04.474
I believe in you.

09:06.320 --> 09:09.949
Big deal, we're having lunch together.
It doesn't have to be awkward.

09:10.040 --> 09:12.031
- What's my bro like in the sack?
- What?

09:12.120 --> 09:13.678
You do not have to answer that.

09:13.760 --> 09:17.878
If he tries hard, but there's room for
improvement, sip your drink.

09:21.200 --> 09:24.875
- What? I was thirsty.
- Ask me if she could be better.

09:28.720 --> 09:30.392
What? Thirsty.

09:30.480 --> 09:32.596
I wasn't thirsty.

09:35.080 --> 09:37.071
Stable condition.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.913
What time is it? Time to dance.

09:49.480 --> 09:52.119
- Pay the man.
- There you go.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.316
Hello, Mr Jackson.

09:54.400 --> 09:58.109
I want to introduce you
to the Washington brothers.

09:58.200 --> 10:01.875
Y'all get nice and cosy up in my wallet.

10:01.960 --> 10:04.599
Before you get too high
on your horse, Tonto,

10:04.680 --> 10:07.274
I feel it's my duty to remind you
of something.

10:07.360 --> 10:13.515
See, you just made a $20 bet on whether
a fellow human being would live or die.

10:14.280 --> 10:18.432
Now tell me, just exactly how does
that make you feel, Mr Sensitive?

10:18.520 --> 10:21.353
Pretty good? All the best.

10:30.360 --> 10:33.113
Why'd you drive someone else's car
across country?

10:33.200 --> 10:35.316
It's a great way to make 300 bucks.

10:35.400 --> 10:37.595
What do you do that
you can take time off?

10:37.680 --> 10:40.353
- I tend bar.
- But not just any bar. It's "the" bar.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.238
When the college kids come home,
it's where they go.

10:43.320 --> 10:46.357
- I go there when I'm home.
- So you live in your home town?

10:46.440 --> 10:49.671
I take care of my mom's place
so she let's me stay with her.

10:49.760 --> 10:51.318
Dan, you don't stay with her.

10:51.400 --> 10:55.837
Come on, he's not like Greg Brady
in the attic with beads for a door.

10:55.920 --> 10:57.831
He totally has his own space.

10:57.920 --> 11:01.196
More like Kirk Cameron
in the last season of Growing Pains

11:01.280 --> 11:04.670
when he lived above the garage
with Boner. Anyone? No.

11:04.760 --> 11:06.796
Am I the only one? Boner?

11:06.880 --> 11:09.713
That's when I realised that
even though I was jealous,

11:09.800 --> 11:12.758
that's not why I was trying to keep
Elliot and Dan apart.

11:12.840 --> 11:13.909
Dan's doing great.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.958
The real reason was
that I was ashamed of my brother.

11:17.040 --> 11:18.951
And I think he knew it too.

11:19.040 --> 11:21.554
You two should probably
get back to work.

11:30.480 --> 11:33.517
These heated seats are amazing.
They make my butt tingle.

11:33.600 --> 11:36.353
Every time you say that,
an angel gets their wings.

11:36.440 --> 11:40.319
It's a sweet ride, but as JD has made
clear, I could never afford this car.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.709
Would you please just let it go?

11:42.800 --> 11:46.031
- So I'll see you.
- Not if I see you first.

11:46.120 --> 11:48.918
I knew my brother would
handle this like he always did

11:49.000 --> 11:51.798
when there was an
emotional conflict between us.

11:51.880 --> 11:54.394
- Can you work the windows from there?
- No. Why?

11:55.920 --> 11:57.717
Oh, God...

11:57.800 --> 11:59.870
Please tell me
that that was the horn.

11:59.960 --> 12:03.475
- There's your heated seat, my friend.
- God, it's everywhere.

12:12.120 --> 12:15.157
Do you have any idea
how long I've been waiting on you?

12:15.240 --> 12:17.470
Next time, if you're not here
in 30 minutes,

12:17.560 --> 12:20.074
I expect a free dead body
or some garlic knots.

12:20.160 --> 12:22.549
Dr Kelso,
that's extremely insensitive.

12:22.640 --> 12:26.838
I don't think so.
Miss Parker, you care to weigh in?

12:26.920 --> 12:29.593
Nope, she's fine with it.
She knows a thing or two.

12:29.680 --> 12:33.036
Except, of course,
that a yellow light means to slow down.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.873
You're not understanding
what I'm trying to say.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.595
- Kitty, this sucks.
- How can I make it better?

12:40.840 --> 12:44.799
- Thank you so much for coming.
- We've been looking forward to this.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.990
You know, ever since he... he died.

12:52.400 --> 12:55.312
- Hey, you OK?
- Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

12:55.400 --> 12:58.517
You and your brother.
The tension was palpable.

12:58.600 --> 13:02.195
I wanted to say something. I was
this close to getting back in the car.

13:02.280 --> 13:05.431
That wouldn't have been wise.
No, thank you, we're fine.

13:11.080 --> 13:13.116
Damn you, you dirty ape!

13:15.120 --> 13:19.955
Babe, you have got to try one of these.
They are to die for.

13:20.040 --> 13:22.838
I'm sorry for your loss.
Go ahead. Try one.

13:25.440 --> 13:28.637
Mother, this is Dr Turk,
the surgeon that worked so hard.

13:28.720 --> 13:32.429
Oh, please,
it's the least I could do for...

13:32.520 --> 13:34.988
You see,
he doesn't even remember his name.

13:35.080 --> 13:39.392
No, no, no I remember his name.
His name was...

13:40.440 --> 13:43.159
His name was... was...

13:46.040 --> 13:49.077
You know, we used to call him
Old Chicken Neck.

13:49.160 --> 13:52.118
This is the problem with doctors today.
They don't care.

13:52.200 --> 13:55.192
No, it's just that recently
I've had a lot of patients.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.840
So it... I've gotten...
I've been really busy.

13:57.920 --> 14:01.959
Not too busy to come here in the middle
of the day and stuff your face for free.

14:02.040 --> 14:04.076
- Damn you, woman.
- Ladies, please.

14:04.160 --> 14:07.675
This is a good, caring doctor.
He did everything he could for Bob.

14:07.760 --> 14:09.273
Right.

14:10.240 --> 14:12.708
This is Bob. That's Bob?

14:12.800 --> 14:14.597
Like for apples, you know, bob.

14:17.520 --> 14:20.876
I get it. Let's see how tough
you are without your costume on.

14:20.960 --> 14:24.669
Go ahead and knock the folders
out of my hand now.

14:27.160 --> 14:30.038
- What costume?
- You weren't wearing a gorilla suit?

14:30.120 --> 14:33.749
Is someone running around
in a gorilla suit? What's he look like?

14:33.840 --> 14:36.195
- A gorilla.
- No, it's not me.

14:36.280 --> 14:39.556
- Why knock the folders from my hand?
- Because you asked me to.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.870
Here you go.

14:41.960 --> 14:45.714
- I didn't ask you to do that.
- That comes free with the folder knock.

14:49.520 --> 14:51.397
- How are you doing?
- Good, sir.

14:51.480 --> 14:53.436
I don't have time to stand and flirt.

14:53.520 --> 14:57.672
There have been rumblings that you let
your brother play doctor the other day.

14:57.760 --> 14:59.034
Dr Kelso, l...

14:59.120 --> 15:02.874
If I had one shred of evidence
that incident actually took place,

15:02.960 --> 15:06.748
you'd be working with my nephew Francis
so fast it'd make your head spin.

15:06.840 --> 15:09.434
- Sir, I don't follow.
- He cleans pools.

15:09.520 --> 15:10.873
I forgot you didn't know.

15:10.960 --> 15:14.032
I trust we will not be seeing
your brother in the hospital.

15:15.720 --> 15:17.073
Not inside, no.

15:17.160 --> 15:19.151
My God, I'm totally going to hell.

15:19.240 --> 15:23.028
Turk, wait, people get thrown out
of funerals every day.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.073
Why are you laughing?

15:28.160 --> 15:31.516
Off the top of my head,
I'd say it's because he's suffering.

15:31.600 --> 15:35.275
Of course, I love the poetry of
someone putting himself on a pedestal

15:35.360 --> 15:39.035
then getting knocked back down
into this puddle of self-hatred

15:39.120 --> 15:42.157
- with the rest of us.
- Did you do this to him?

15:42.240 --> 15:47.598
I don't know. Does anybody ever
really do anything to anybody else?

15:47.680 --> 15:50.911
You're gonna tell me why
you did this and it better be good.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.549
How does "for poops and giggles"
grab you?

16:00.160 --> 16:05.871
Isn't there something you want to talk
about? Like cars or sports or boobs.

16:05.960 --> 16:08.110
Boobs. Remember Fred Keifer's mom?

16:08.200 --> 16:11.476
She wore a tank top
to Fred's 1 3th birthday party.

16:11.560 --> 16:14.791
She taught us how to bob for apples
and three guys passed out.

16:14.880 --> 16:18.236
Great story. Now how about something
with more substance?

16:19.320 --> 16:22.517
- Remember the cans on Pat Clark's mom?
- Those were awesome.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.113
Forget it.

16:24.200 --> 16:28.079
Elliot, come on.
What does she expect us to talk about?

16:28.160 --> 16:31.789
Maybe that you're embarrassed by me
you make excuses to your friends

16:31.880 --> 16:33.711
about how I live my life.

16:34.920 --> 16:36.399
Oh, yeah.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.998
We're working hard on a cure.

16:45.160 --> 16:47.913
- Let's go. Field trip.
- I got things to do.

16:48.000 --> 16:53.233
Off to another funeral? Come with me
and if you're late for the graveyard,

16:53.320 --> 16:56.790
I'll scour the obituaries with you
this weekend and we can go nuts.

16:56.880 --> 16:58.677
- Carla put you up to this?
- My idea.

16:58.760 --> 17:03.311
I want to be close with you. I just
can't figure out how. Turn around.

17:03.400 --> 17:05.310
Turn around.

17:06.520 --> 17:08.317
You see Dr Wen in there?

17:08.400 --> 17:13.030
He's explaining that something
went wrong and the patient died.

17:13.119 --> 17:18.240
He's gonna tell them what happened,
say sorry, then he's going back to work.

17:18.319 --> 17:22.632
You think anybody else in that room
is going back to work today?

17:22.720 --> 17:26.759
That is why we distance ourselves.
That's why we make jokes.

17:28.520 --> 17:33.992
We don't do it because it's fun.
We do it so we can get by.

17:34.080 --> 17:37.516
And sometimes because it's fun.

17:39.480 --> 17:42.040
But mostly it's the getting by thing.

17:44.720 --> 17:46.711
And by the way...

17:46.920 --> 17:48.478
Bob.

17:48.560 --> 17:50.710
Who doesn't get that?

17:55.360 --> 17:59.558
We're proud you became a doctor, but
just because I haven't achieved as much

17:59.640 --> 18:03.713
- doesn't mean I don't like what I do.
- Nothing wrong with being a bartender.

18:03.800 --> 18:06.633
- I like living with Mom.
- She makes great eggs.

18:06.720 --> 18:11.794
All in all, I'm pretty damn happy.
I'm happy, you know.

18:12.440 --> 18:14.351
And now for the apology.

18:14.440 --> 18:18.877
That's a load of crap.
Look, I know you, OK?

18:18.960 --> 18:21.758
The reason you wanted
to pretend you're a doctor

18:21.840 --> 18:25.753
is cos you hate working in that bar
and you wanted to feel like somebody.

18:25.840 --> 18:29.799
You're not driving that car
across the country for the $300.

18:29.880 --> 18:32.917
You're doing it cos you like how
you feel when you drive it.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.798
The funny thing is
you could be that guy.

18:35.880 --> 18:39.714
But you're afraid that if you have to
try at something, you might fail,

18:39.800 --> 18:43.156
and that's not
a chance you're willing to take.

18:45.280 --> 18:50.308
What can I say?
It's been a real pleasure seeing you.

19:05.560 --> 19:08.870
Right then, I knew I'd never see
my brother the same way again.

19:25.720 --> 19:29.190
You can never let go
of the kid inside of you.

19:29.280 --> 19:31.953
That girl in the wolf outfit
is checking you out.

19:32.040 --> 19:34.952
I'd let her blow my house down.
You know what I'm saying?

19:39.160 --> 19:42.675
You see, it's the kid inside of us
that keeps us from going crazy.
