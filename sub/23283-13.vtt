So maybe you'll

18:51.917 --> 18:54.917
believe Britt himself.

19:00.125 --> 19:02.333
[all gasp]

19:02.375 --> 19:03.792
- Britt!

19:03.834 --> 19:06.125
<i>- [gasps] Didgeri-don't!</i>

19:06.166 --> 19:09.542
- Okay, Britt.

19:06.166 --> 19:09.542
Reveal your evil plan.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.291
<i>- What's going on?</i>

19:11.333 --> 19:12.792
<i>I don't have an evil plan.</i>

19:12.834 --> 19:14.834
- We knew you wouldn't

19:12.834 --> 19:14.834
admit it.

19:14.875 --> 19:18.583
Now things are about

19:14.875 --> 19:18.583
to get ugly.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.250
- What's that on his feet?

19:20.291 --> 19:21.625
- Peanut butter.

19:21.667 --> 19:22.959
- How did he step

19:21.667 --> 19:22.959
in peanut butter?

19:23.000 --> 19:25.917
- Peanut butter stepped on him.

19:25.959 --> 19:29.959
- Wait, so is peanut butter,

19:25.959 --> 19:29.959
like, a guy or something?

19:30.000 --> 19:33.834
- No, just regular peanut

19:30.000 --> 19:33.834
butter from a jar.

19:33.875 --> 19:35.250
- Is it crunchy or creamy?

19:35.291 --> 19:36.625
- Okay, what does it matter?

19:37.500 --> 19:40.542
[whistles] Sharky!

19:44.458 --> 19:47.834
<i>- [laughing]</i>

19:47.875 --> 19:50.750
- Anything to tell us now,

19:47.875 --> 19:50.750
"mate"?

19:50.792 --> 19:52.750
- [gasping]

19:50.792 --> 19:52.750
Fine, I'll admit it!

19:52.792 --> 19:55.458
The truth is,

19:52.792 --> 19:55.458
the party isn't for Avery.

19:55.500 --> 19:57.041
It's for you.

19:57.083 --> 20:01.041
- Yeah, even though

19:57.083 --> 20:01.041
it really is my birthday.

20:01.083 --> 20:03.000
[noisemaker squawks]

20:03.041 --> 20:04.583
<i>- [laughing]</i>

20:03.041 --> 20:04.583
<i>I wanted to thank you</i>

20:04.625 --> 20:06.375
<i>for accepting me</i>

20:04.625 --> 20:06.375
<i>into your family.</i>

20:06.417 --> 20:08.750
<i>You're the best brothers</i>

20:06.417 --> 20:08.750
<i>and sister a guy could have.</i>

20:08.792 --> 20:10.000
all: Aww.

20:10.041 --> 20:11.709
- No "aww"s!

20:10.041 --> 20:11.709
Don't "aww"!

20:11.750 --> 20:13.917
He's trying to trick you.

20:13.959 --> 20:15.291
- Well, Britt,

20:15.333 --> 20:16.625
<i>if you really wanted</i>

20:15.333 --> 20:16.625
<i>to thank us</i>

20:16.667 --> 20:17.792
<i>for being part of your family,</i>

20:17.834 --> 20:20.250
then what about your list?

20:20.291 --> 20:23.041
"One: get rid of the Quads."

20:23.083 --> 20:24.583
<i>- [giggling] I needed to</i>

20:23.083 --> 20:24.583
<i>get rid of you guys</i>

20:24.625 --> 20:26.417
<i>so I could plan your party.</i>

20:26.458 --> 20:28.750
[together] Oh.

20:28.792 --> 20:30.166
- Well, what about number two?

20:30.208 --> 20:32.000
"Take over Get Sporty"!

20:32.041 --> 20:34.625
- Yeah, so we could decorate

20:32.041 --> 20:34.625
for your party.

20:34.667 --> 20:37.542
[together] Oh.

20:37.583 --> 20:40.917
- Well, you certainly won't be

20:37.583 --> 20:40.917
able to explain number three.

20:40.959 --> 20:42.625
"Celebrate"--which,

20:40.959 --> 20:42.625
now that I say out loud,

20:42.667 --> 20:44.750
probably means

20:42.667 --> 20:44.750
celebrate for our party.

20:44.792 --> 20:46.417
- Turn the list over.

20:44.792 --> 20:46.417
- Why?

20:51.291 --> 20:54.125
- "Trick Nicky, Ricky, and Dawn

20:51.291 --> 20:54.125
with a decoy party for Avery,

20:54.166 --> 20:58.000
then throw them

20:54.166 --> 20:58.000
the best surprise party ever."

20:58.041 --> 21:01.000
[together] Oh.

21:01.041 --> 21:02.750
- Seems like something

21:01.041 --> 21:02.750
that should be

21:02.792 --> 21:04.959
on the front of a list,

21:02.792 --> 21:04.959
but okay.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.959
- We all know

21:05.000 --> 21:06.959
you guys are impossible

21:07.000 --> 21:09.041
to keep a secret from,

21:07.000 --> 21:09.041
so the plan was

21:09.083 --> 21:10.875
to make you suspicious

21:09.083 --> 21:10.875
by having Britt sneak off

21:10.917 --> 21:12.709
with all of your friends.

21:10.917 --> 21:12.709
- And once you guys started

21:12.750 --> 21:15.041
snooping around, he pretended

21:12.750 --> 21:15.041
the party was for Avery,

21:15.083 --> 21:16.709
which we knew you'd crash.

21:16.750 --> 21:18.375
- It was all Toots's idea.

21:16.750 --> 21:18.375
- [sighs]

21:18.417 --> 21:19.875
Is everybody saying it?

21:19.917 --> 21:21.792
all: Yes.

21:21.834 --> 21:23.667
- So, I guess...

21:23.709 --> 21:25.875
- Surprise, mates!

21:25.917 --> 21:27.291
- How'd you get out?

21:27.333 --> 21:28.750
- You covered me

21:27.333 --> 21:28.750
in peanut butter.

21:28.792 --> 21:30.500
I slipped right out.

21:30.542 --> 21:32.458
- I can't believe you went

21:30.542 --> 21:32.458
to all that trouble, Britt.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.458
That was really nice.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.458
- Hm.

21:34.500 --> 21:36.542
- Oh--sorry we socked

21:34.500 --> 21:36.542
and peanut butter'd you.

21:36.583 --> 21:38.333
- Yeah, it's the kind of thing

21:36.583 --> 21:38.333
we normally do

21:38.375 --> 21:40.125
to our closest friends

21:38.375 --> 21:40.125
and family,

21:40.166 --> 21:42.542
so...welcome to the family.

21:42.583 --> 21:44.458
- [chuckles]

21:42.583 --> 21:44.458
And speaking of family,

21:44.500 --> 21:47.250
let's get this party started

21:44.500 --> 21:47.250
with a little karaoke!

21:47.291 --> 21:48.917
[all cheering]

21:48.959 --> 21:52.125
Ah, this microphone's

21:48.959 --> 21:52.125
got a little dust on it.

21:52.166 --> 21:54.625
- Is that Dicky's sock?

21:54.667 --> 21:56.166
- Our first number will

21:54.667 --> 21:56.166
be a little song

21:56.208 --> 21:59.458
called "We Are Fa..."

21:59.500 --> 22:00.667
- Toots!

22:03.166 --> 22:06.041
- He'll be fine.

22:03.166 --> 22:06.041
- Yeah.
