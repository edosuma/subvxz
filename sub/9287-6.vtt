01:31.393 --> 01:34.271
- Hey, Max.
- Alec, what the hell are you doing here?

01:34.353 --> 01:36.821
Stealing a baseball. How about you?

01:36.913 --> 01:39.586
Trying to get back the money
I lost because of you.

01:39.673 --> 01:43.268
Me too. Figured I'd swipe this ball,
repay my friend Max...

01:43.353 --> 01:45.025
- Yeah, right.
- I'm serious.

01:45.113 --> 01:49.106
You wanna pay me back? Get a job.
Find out what it's like to live in the real world.

01:49.193 --> 01:51.787
Sorry, is this what you call
your real-world job?

01:51.873 --> 01:56.230
This is an extreme situation, which,
in case you didn't hear me, is your fault.

01:56.313 --> 01:59.703
I wanna make it right.
If you hadn't paid that doctor, I'd be dead.

01:59.793 --> 02:01.670
- Don't remind me.
- I owe you, Max.

02:01.753 --> 02:05.268
Go home. I'll finish up. I'll fence it
and get you the money tomorrow.

02:05.353 --> 02:06.991
A: I don't believe you.

02:07.073 --> 02:11.863
B: Sammy Sosa's 756th home-run ball
is worth way more than what you owe me.

02:12.873 --> 02:15.785
- Give it back!
- All right, we'll split it 50-50.

02:15.873 --> 02:19.070
- Yeah, right. I got here first.
- OK, 60-40, hm?

02:19.153 --> 02:24.068
Get a life, get a job and stop sticking your
nose into mine. Don't make me kick your ass.

02:24.153 --> 02:27.509
This whole tough-chick-act thing
is really unbecoming.

02:27.593 --> 02:32.269
"I'll bounce you on your ass, I'll smack
your bitch head." It's so unfeminine.

02:40.433 --> 02:43.231
- Great. Look what you did.
- God, I hate you!

02:43.313 --> 02:47.591
Hey, I know this is a bad time,
but can I get a ride home?

02:52.593 --> 02:54.902
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop. Stop.

02:55.633 --> 02:58.864
- What now?
- No sector pass.

02:58.953 --> 03:02.832
I've been gettin' past checkpoints
the sneak-and-creep, Manticore way.

03:04.593 --> 03:07.903
- Thanks for the ride.
- Thanks for blowing my plan to get money.

03:07.993 --> 03:10.553
You should have let go
when you had the chance.

03:10.633 --> 03:14.148
I should have let your head explode
when I had the chance.

03:22.273 --> 03:25.822
All right, let's see your sector pass.
Come on, I haven't got all...

03:25.913 --> 03:28.302
Jam Pony messenger.

03:28.393 --> 03:30.190
OK.

04:03.233 --> 04:06.111
Hey. Let's see some ID.

04:15.033 --> 04:17.024
I'm talkin' to you.

04:20.913 --> 04:22.312
Hey!

04:29.273 --> 04:31.264
Come out of there.

04:40.993 --> 04:45.669
You make me come back there to get you,
you're comin' out on a stretcher. Hear me?

05:03.993 --> 05:08.703
They designed her to be
the perfect soldier, a human weapon.

05:08.793 --> 05:10.784
Then she escaped.

05:10.873 --> 05:15.230
In a future not far from now,
in a broken world,

05:15.313 --> 05:17.622
she is haunted by her past.

05:17.713 --> 05:22.503
She cannot run.
She must fight to discover her destiny.

05:58.353 --> 06:02.551
I practically had it in my hand. My fence
even had a buyer lined up. 15 grand.

06:02.633 --> 06:05.830
- And Alec had to ruin everything.
- I couldn't believe it.

06:05.913 --> 06:08.985
- It was your heist. You were there first.
- That's what I said.

06:09.073 --> 06:12.668
He was gonna take whatever he got from it
and blow it on hookers and beer.

06:12.753 --> 06:14.869
- Guy has no decency.
- Tell me about it.

06:14.953 --> 06:17.421
To rip off what you were rightfully stealing!

06:17.513 --> 06:21.665
Exactly. It's like he's a child
who doesn't know right from wrong.

06:23.033 --> 06:26.264
- Are you busting on me?
- Me?

06:26.553 --> 06:30.626
I only steal from bad people,
and only for a good cause.

06:30.713 --> 06:35.229
Like when you need a part for your
motorcycle or a cocktail dress for a wedding.

06:35.313 --> 06:37.304
Without my motorcycle, I can't...

06:38.153 --> 06:41.111
And the dress thing, I was gonna return it.

06:41.193 --> 06:44.663
- This isn't even about me. This is about you.
- How do you mean?

06:44.753 --> 06:48.507
I went after that baseball to pay you back
the money you lost on that doctor.

06:48.593 --> 06:50.390
- Really?
- Really.

06:52.713 --> 06:55.307
But seeing how you feel, I'll forget it.

06:55.873 --> 07:00.424
Yeah, I guess so. I mean, I could
use the cash to keep Eyes Only going,

07:00.513 --> 07:03.664
but I'll figure it out.

07:03.753 --> 07:07.712
- I could find something else to steal.
- There are a lot of bad guys out there.

07:07.793 --> 07:10.626
But I wouldn't wanna
drag you down to my level.

07:11.633 --> 07:13.624
See ya.

07:20.153 --> 07:22.144
Joshua.

07:24.953 --> 07:26.466
Hey, big fella.

07:26.553 --> 07:28.145
Hey.

07:29.393 --> 07:31.861
It's me, Max.

07:31.953 --> 07:33.750
Max.

07:34.473 --> 07:37.351
- I'm sorry.
- Bad dream?

07:39.353 --> 07:41.742
You didn't come yesterday.

07:44.753 --> 07:48.905
I know. I'm sorry. I had this thing.
It took a lot longer than I thought.

07:48.993 --> 07:50.984
I was hungry.

07:52.193 --> 07:54.184
Little Debbie.

07:55.273 --> 07:57.070
I bought you a book.

07:57.153 --> 08:01.704
It's about a killer clown that lives
under the city, eats small children.

08:01.793 --> 08:03.784
Why?

08:03.873 --> 08:06.546
I don't know. Why do clowns do anything?

08:06.633 --> 08:08.749
Maybe it's angry.

08:09.633 --> 08:11.589
Maybe.

08:13.753 --> 08:16.221
What's wrong? You OK?

08:17.553 --> 08:19.669
- Hurt.
- Let me see.

08:21.873 --> 08:24.148
What happened? Did you go outside?

08:24.233 --> 08:26.906
Had to. I was hungry.

08:26.993 --> 08:29.587
Who did this to you?

08:29.673 --> 08:33.063
Dog bit me. I was trying to get his food.

08:34.073 --> 08:38.624
Look, I'm sorry I didn't come by yesterday
and get you food.

08:39.033 --> 08:42.469
I'll try to never let it happen again,
but going out is too dangerous.

08:42.553 --> 08:44.509
- If people see who...
- I know.

08:45.113 --> 08:49.345
People are afraid of what
they don't understand. I know.

08:51.833 --> 08:53.824
Never forget it.

08:57.673 --> 08:58.992
OK.

09:02.553 --> 09:06.785
I gotta go to work, but I'll be back tonight.

09:06.873 --> 09:09.262
- Promise.
- OK.

09:18.193 --> 09:21.230
What's up with the checkpoints?
Lines are round the block.

09:21.313 --> 09:24.305
I heard some cop
Got jumped or somethin'.

09:26.753 --> 09:28.744
I cannot believe this.

09:31.073 --> 09:33.303
- Who's that?
- You don't wanna know.

09:34.553 --> 09:36.987
Was "Stay out of my life" not direct enough?

09:37.073 --> 09:41.749
You told me to find a job. What better place
than somewhere I already have a friend?

09:41.833 --> 09:43.393
If by "friend" you mean someone who'd just
as soon drop an anvil on you, then welcome.

09:43.393 --> 09:46.669
If by "friend" you mean someone who'd just
as soon drop an anvil on you, then welcome.

09:46.753 --> 09:50.587
- You don't mean that.
- Find me an anvil and watch me go.

09:50.673 --> 09:53.062
Max, that hurts. It really does.

09:53.153 --> 09:56.589
Your words inspired me.
I wanna change my ways.

09:56.673 --> 09:58.470
Whatever.

09:59.313 --> 10:03.670
This'll only take a second.
Hey, Normal. Loser lookin' for a job.

10:03.753 --> 10:07.826
No jobs here. Got enough of you slugs to
keep me in Maalox till the cows come home.

10:08.153 --> 10:12.146
- Oh, well.
- Hey, aren't you that boxer dude?

10:15.113 --> 10:17.343
- You're Monty Cora.
- Monty Cora?

10:17.433 --> 10:18.991
It's a stage name.

10:19.073 --> 10:23.066
I once saw this man take down Mangler Miller
in less than 45 seconds.

10:23.153 --> 10:26.941
- Wonderful. Bravo!
- Thank you, um, Normal?

10:27.033 --> 10:29.388
Please, call me Reagan.

10:29.473 --> 10:33.512
- So you're lookin' for a job, huh?
- Yeah. I'd love to be a part of team Jam Pony.

10:33.593 --> 10:36.391
I can always use a strong rooster
in the henhouse.

10:36.473 --> 10:39.067
- Normal, you don't wanna do this.
- Shut up, missy.

10:39.153 --> 10:41.587
Know where I could
score a bike around here?

10:41.673 --> 10:43.664
Here we go.

10:47.753 --> 10:50.790
- Here we go. Easy-peasy Japanesey.
- Thank you.

10:50.873 --> 10:54.582
Oh, uh, don't I need
one of those sector pass things?

10:54.673 --> 10:58.382
Yes, you'll have it by morning.
This one'll show you the ropes.

10:58.473 --> 11:01.624
Now bip! These packages
are missing their mommies horribly.

11:01.713 --> 11:05.865
- This isn't happening.
- Good catch, Maxie. You're a rock star!

11:07.393 --> 11:09.384
Shut up.

11:18.033 --> 11:20.706
- Monty Cora?
- Yeah, it's a play on Manticore.

11:20.793 --> 11:23.182
Yeah, I got that. Way to lay low.

11:23.273 --> 11:25.741
- Why don't you relax?
- Why don't you wise up?

11:25.833 --> 11:28.267
You can start by covering that bar code.

11:29.113 --> 11:31.502
Now remember, be polite.

11:35.273 --> 11:37.662
I need a signature.

11:38.953 --> 11:42.104
- What's this?
- Jam Pony, ma'am. It's a package for you.

11:42.193 --> 11:44.582
I'll go and get my glasses.

11:45.393 --> 11:47.190
You call that polite?

11:47.273 --> 11:50.026
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing.

11:50.993 --> 11:53.302
- You're casing the place.
- No, I'm not.

11:53.393 --> 11:57.944
Yes, you are. I knew that's why you took
this job - for a sector pass and to rob places.

11:58.033 --> 12:01.992
- Isn't that why you took this job?
- It was, but it's not any more.

12:03.473 --> 12:06.385
Check it out.
Grandma's got a plasma-screen TV.

12:06.873 --> 12:09.148
- You're not gonna steal her TV.
- Why not?

12:09.233 --> 12:11.622
- It's wrong.
- As opposed to stealing a baseball?

12:11.713 --> 12:14.227
The guy who owns that gallery
is a major crook.

12:14.313 --> 12:17.032
So it's OK to steal from him
because he's a bad guy.

12:17.473 --> 12:21.022
- I'm just trying to get by.
- Get by on a salary.

12:21.113 --> 12:23.183
- Minimum wage?
- Plus tips.

12:23.273 --> 12:26.390
- That's where the whole polite part comes in.
- Right!

12:27.393 --> 12:31.181
- Did I get it right?
- Yeah. Have a nice day.

12:31.273 --> 12:33.264
Oh, just a second.

12:34.553 --> 12:36.544
These are for you.

12:37.353 --> 12:39.787
Oh, a quarter?

12:39.873 --> 12:43.752
- Thanks again.
- She might as well kiss that TV goodbye.

12:50.313 --> 12:55.546
He's from Manticore, huh? Say what you
want, they sure knew how to make 'em pretty.

12:55.633 --> 13:02.789
Spend an afternoon with him. He'll drive you
crazy with his laughing, talking, breathing...

13:02.873 --> 13:06.946
- Sugar, you got issues.
- Ladies, let me get the next one.

13:07.033 --> 13:10.469
- Skippy owes me about $80 worth of beer.
- You don't have to.

13:10.553 --> 13:12.544
No, no, I want to.

13:15.073 --> 13:17.507
I'm telling you, he's no good.

13:17.593 --> 13:20.391
I know. Free beer. Just flat-out evil.

13:24.913 --> 13:27.711
I saw on the board
you're working Sector Four tomorrow.

13:27.793 --> 13:29.351
Yep.

13:29.433 --> 13:34.951
Do me a favour.
Drop this off for me at this address.

13:36.513 --> 13:38.504
$20 in it for you.

13:39.833 --> 13:41.824
What's inside?

13:42.433 --> 13:46.665
- Don't ask and I'll make it $30.
- That works for me.

13:49.233 --> 13:52.225
Hear about that cop
attacked by a mutant last night?

13:52.313 --> 13:55.510
- Here we go again.
- Some kind of dog-faced thing.

13:55.593 --> 13:58.266
- Dog-faced?
- Yeah, big with lots of shaggy hair.

13:58.353 --> 14:02.062
- Really?
- Cop caught it looking for food in the trash.

14:02.153 --> 14:04.906
Ate the tongue out of his mouth.

14:04.993 --> 14:10.989
He got a piece of it before it ran off, so you
gotta figure it's hurt and none of us are safe.

14:12.153 --> 14:14.144
I gotta go.

14:15.553 --> 14:17.862
What is with her?

14:18.353 --> 14:20.992
- Where you going?
- Gotta swing by Joshua's.

14:21.073 --> 14:26.101
- You think he had something to do with this?
- Of course not. Joshua'd never hurt anybody.

14:26.193 --> 14:29.071
- You don't know what he's capable of.
- Yes, I do.

14:29.153 --> 14:32.862
- Then why are you going over there?
- Because I promised I would.

14:40.833 --> 14:42.824
Joshua?

15:23.873 --> 15:25.864
Anybody in there?

15:55.913 --> 15:59.508
- Been paging you all morning.
- Couldn't find a payphone. What's up?

15:59.593 --> 16:02.790
A cop was attacked last night.
Makes three in the last week.

16:02.873 --> 16:05.307
- Yeah, I heard about that.
- One survived.

16:05.673 --> 16:09.461
Claims he was jumped by
some kind of half-man, half-animal.

16:11.313 --> 16:13.543
Good news is no one believes him.

16:14.193 --> 16:17.185
Apparently he's known
for drinking on the job.

16:17.273 --> 16:19.503
So what do they think it was then?

16:19.593 --> 16:23.472
A pack of wild dogs maybe,
or some coyotes that wandered into the city.

16:23.553 --> 16:27.592
- Makes sense.
- Except for the half-man, half-animal part.

16:27.673 --> 16:31.382
- I thought you'd be all over this.
- I can't chase down every rumour.

16:31.473 --> 16:36.308
It's no rumour. Two cops are dead. A third's
in the hospital with his tongue ripped out.

16:36.393 --> 16:39.783
If a transgenic's responsible,
you have to do something.

16:39.873 --> 16:44.901
- Give me some solid evidence and I will.
- I'm working on it. What is with you anyway?

16:45.313 --> 16:47.304
I gotta get to work.

16:47.393 --> 16:49.987
What are you not telling me?

16:51.313 --> 16:54.191
I went by Joshua's last night
and he wasn't there.

16:54.273 --> 16:59.301
- But you don't think...
- No! I'm just worried about him, that's all.

17:00.753 --> 17:03.142
There's something else, isn't there?

17:06.433 --> 17:09.425
People are dying. If a transgenic's involved...

17:09.512 --> 17:12.823
Yeah, I know, it's on me
cos I let them out in the world.

17:12.913 --> 17:18.306
I was gonna say you better do something,
otherwise it means exposure for all of you.

17:20.833 --> 17:23.142
- I gotta go.
- Hey.

17:24.713 --> 17:27.511
In case you can't find a payphone again.

17:41.273 --> 17:43.582
Can I help you, little man?

17:43.673 --> 17:45.868
No. I'm just making a delivery.

17:46.553 --> 17:51.343
- I think you might be lost, mate.
- No, dude. This is the address. Says so here.

17:54.393 --> 17:57.749
- Yeah, it says so right here.
- Then I stand corrected.

17:58.393 --> 18:00.509
What's in it?

18:00.593 --> 18:02.584
None of your business.

18:03.353 --> 18:06.345
Well, it is our business. That's the problem.

18:07.833 --> 18:10.472
See, this is our little piece of paradise.

18:10.753 --> 18:14.302
We're what you'd call... territorial.

18:19.273 --> 18:24.267
So he hits me in the face three times. I'm just
smiling, you know, waiting for my opening.

18:24.353 --> 18:27.550
And then wham!
One punch right in the jaw, goes down.

18:27.633 --> 18:30.306
What about Sammy the Superfly?
How'd you handle him?

18:30.393 --> 18:33.465
Superfly. Superfly's not as fast as you think.

18:34.033 --> 18:36.263
Holy... What happened to you?

18:36.353 --> 18:39.151
Steelheads. Beat the snot out of me.

18:39.233 --> 18:43.272
- Steelheads?
- They're into implants and biotech stuff.

18:43.353 --> 18:49.383
Shouldn't hang out with those lowlifes.
They're amped off their gourds on hormones.

18:49.473 --> 18:53.182
- Wait. You weren't on a run, were you?
- Not exactly.

18:53.873 --> 18:55.864
Thank God.

18:57.273 --> 19:00.424
So, uh, what was in that package anyway?

19:00.513 --> 19:02.663
- Drugs?
- Of course not.

19:02.753 --> 19:05.633
Why don't you tell me, or I'm gonna
bust you and Normal'll can your ass.

19:05.633 --> 19:06.986
Why don't you tell me, or I'm gonna
bust you and Normal'll can your ass.

19:08.833 --> 19:10.630
Androstamine.

19:11.033 --> 19:16.266
It's a synthetic hormone. Bodybuilders use it.
Been doing some nice business with it.

19:16.353 --> 19:21.029
Not any more. They told me to tell whoever
I was working for to stay off their turf.

19:21.113 --> 19:23.308
Really?

19:23.393 --> 19:26.146
Sorry. I didn't know.
I wouldn't have sent you if I did.

19:26.233 --> 19:29.270
- Well, next time just keep me out of it.
- Hey, hey.

19:30.873 --> 19:34.343
Why don't you...
Why don't you get a new shirt on me?

19:35.793 --> 19:37.784
Got some dirt on my pants.

19:38.833 --> 19:41.631
- Get yourself some new pants.
- Thanks.

19:42.953 --> 19:46.150
- And you're buying at Crash tonight, right?
- You got it.

19:46.233 --> 19:48.030
Buddy.

21:05.753 --> 21:07.948
Officer Pearson.

21:08.033 --> 21:12.265
I'm Doctor Livingston.
I need to ask you a few questions.

21:12.353 --> 21:15.504
You claimed you were attacked
by some kind of creature.

21:16.273 --> 21:20.471
If that's the case, rabies could be a concern.

21:22.793 --> 21:26.263
Did you get a good look
at whatever it was that did this to you?

21:28.113 --> 21:30.786
You think you could identify it in a picture?

21:40.193 --> 21:42.309
That's him? You're sure?

21:44.273 --> 21:46.264
I'm sorry. I don't...

21:56.713 --> 21:58.624
Bar code.

21:58.713 --> 22:01.511
He had a bar code on his neck.

22:02.313 --> 22:03.382
OK.

22:11.473 --> 22:12.952
Max, it's me.

22:13.033 --> 22:15.547
I talked to the cop that survived the attack.

22:15.633 --> 22:18.466
- Yeah?
- Bad news.

22:18.553 --> 22:22.705
I showed him that picture of Joshua that
turned up in the tabloid a few weeks ago.

22:22.793 --> 22:24.784
- He ID'd him.
- That's impossible.

22:24.873 --> 22:28.343
- Max, the guy recognised him.
- Well, he's wrong.

22:29.513 --> 22:32.710
- Well, he got a look at his bar code.
- Bar code?

22:32.793 --> 22:35.944
- Joshua doesn't have a bar code.
- I thought you all did.

22:36.713 --> 22:40.626
He's the first one Manticore ever made.
He doesn't have one.

22:41.233 --> 22:43.747
What? I couldn't hear you. Max?

22:44.153 --> 22:45.825
Max!

23:00.073 --> 23:01.870
Joshua?

23:09.513 --> 23:11.504
That's not very nice.

23:15.113 --> 23:16.393
Run, Isaac! Run!

23:16.393 --> 23:17.064
Run, Isaac! Run!

23:18.913 --> 23:21.029
Joshua?

23:26.633 --> 23:28.430
What are you doing down here?

23:57.273 --> 24:00.071
- We should cap this sack of crap right now.
- Yeah.

24:00.153 --> 24:04.988
- It'll walk on the doggie defence.
- It's not a dog, you idiot. It's a werewolf.

24:05.073 --> 24:10.431
- I'm an idiot? So where's the full moon?
- Full moon's just a legend. Read a book.

24:10.513 --> 24:12.822
You're both idiots.

24:12.913 --> 24:17.828
What we have here is one of those mutants.
It's been in the paper the last few weeks.

24:17.913 --> 24:20.985
Sarge says Feds are coming
to take him off our hands.

24:21.073 --> 24:23.667
- The Feds?
- Some agency I never heard of.

24:23.753 --> 24:29.066
I don't care who they are. This thing's been
killing cops. We oughta teach it a lesson.

24:36.153 --> 24:38.144
How you doin', dog-man? Come on.

24:48.513 --> 24:50.504
How do you like that, huh? Huh?

24:51.393 --> 24:53.384
Don't...

24:56.593 --> 24:58.470
Don't like it.

24:59.113 --> 25:01.832
Christ. The damn thing talks.

25:05.833 --> 25:10.384
- Two of them. You're sure?
- That's how Joshua got hurt, stopping Isaac.

25:10.473 --> 25:10.713
Whoa, slow down.
Joshua got hurt? Who's Isaac?

25:10.713 --> 25:13.352
Whoa, slow down.
Joshua got hurt? Who's Isaac?

25:13.433 --> 25:15.867
- That's the other one's name.
- OK.

25:15.953 --> 25:19.582
When I went to Joshua's the other day,
his side was all bandaged up.

25:19.673 --> 25:22.392
- You didn't tell me that.
- Now I know what it meant.

25:22.473 --> 25:26.591
- Care to let me in on it?
- He got hurt stopping Isaac killing that cop.

25:26.673 --> 25:30.382
That's a bit of a reach.
For all we know, they both attacked him.

25:30.473 --> 25:34.148
- Joshua would never hurt anybody.
- Why didn't he tell you what happened?

25:34.233 --> 25:37.031
- I don't know.
- He's protecting a killer.

25:37.113 --> 25:41.072
- The cops got the wrong guy.
- Guess what, it doesn't matter.

25:41.153 --> 25:45.066
They've got a dog-man. They don't care
if he's murdering cops or herding sheep.

25:45.153 --> 25:47.951
They just wanna know what the hell he is.

25:48.433 --> 25:51.743
- I gotta get him outta there. Where is he?
- 12th Precinct.

25:52.313 --> 25:54.508
- What about Isaac?
- I'll get to him later.

25:54.593 --> 25:56.390
After he kills somebody else?

25:56.473 --> 26:01.627
Instead of busting my chops because I can't
do two things at once, you do something!

26:06.353 --> 26:11.711
Are you gonna help me, or is the one-armed
guy gonna load the whole truck by himself?

26:11.793 --> 26:15.149
I'm just trying to figure out
what's in it, that's all.

26:16.193 --> 26:18.991
- What do you hear?
- Oh, sloshing.

26:20.873 --> 26:24.627
All right, lads, step it up.
Better get these lovelies on ice.

26:24.713 --> 26:28.786
Uh, Eddy, we're just wondering.
What's in the boxes?

26:29.353 --> 26:31.344
Livers and kidneys.

26:32.833 --> 26:37.224
You mean... We're hefting these around
so you can make some nasty English pie?

26:37.313 --> 26:42.148
- These are human livers and kidneys.
- Whoa. I'm not eating pie made out of people.

26:42.233 --> 26:45.031
We're gonna sell 'em. They're for transplants.

26:45.113 --> 26:48.503
We got buyers overseas
willing to pay top dollar for this lot.

26:48.593 --> 26:50.584
Excuse me, gentlemen.

26:52.073 --> 26:55.952
I'm looking for three ugly Steelheads
that beat up my friend this morning.

26:56.033 --> 26:57.830
Well, you found them.

26:57.913 --> 27:01.701
What happened to you?
Did you accidentally chew your arm off?

27:01.793 --> 27:07.550
Actually, I'm pre-op. Getting a top-of-the-line,
Japanese-made cyber arm put in next week.

27:07.633 --> 27:10.386
Whatever moves your furniture.
Here's the thing.

27:10.473 --> 27:13.704
My friend was carrying a package
that belonged to me.

27:13.793 --> 27:16.671
You guys took it. I need to get it back.

27:16.753 --> 27:20.143
This seems to be a breakdown
in communication, doesn't it?

27:20.233 --> 27:24.192
Maybe your friend didn't relay our message.

27:24.273 --> 27:27.185
Nobody around here sells andy but us.

27:28.193 --> 27:30.184
Yeah. See...

27:31.073 --> 27:33.143
here's the problem.

27:33.233 --> 27:36.543
I had a buyer that was willing
to pay me $500 for that package.

27:36.633 --> 27:42.310
He's upset he didn't get his andy, I'm upset
I didn't get my cash, you're upset because...

27:42.393 --> 27:48.229
Well, I'm not quite sure why you're upset,
but you seem to be, so why not give me $500,

27:48.313 --> 27:53.023
and I get outta here before anybody
gets more upset than they already are.

27:55.793 --> 27:59.991
What's a poofter like you
need with 500 bucks anyway, eh?

28:01.633 --> 28:04.784
Actually, I need it for a ride on your mum.

28:07.993 --> 28:09.426
It's me.

28:09.513 --> 28:12.107
Excuse me, fellas. I'm sorry. Hello?

28:12.193 --> 28:13.990
You cheeky bastard.

28:14.073 --> 28:16.507
- Alec, it's Logan.
- Oh, hey.

28:18.673 --> 28:21.312
- What was that?
- Nothin'. What's goin' on?

28:21.913 --> 28:23.062
You OK?

28:26.113 --> 28:28.547
No, no, I'm fine.

28:30.233 --> 28:33.350
- So, what's up?
- I need your help.

28:34.553 --> 28:37.192
- It's just cos she's hot, you know.
- What is?

28:37.273 --> 28:39.833
Everything. Everything she gets away with.

28:39.913 --> 28:43.872
D'you think we'd be in this dump
looking for God knows what if she were ugly?

28:43.953 --> 28:46.945
We're down here to give Max a hand.

28:47.033 --> 28:49.024
You're so whipped.

28:50.873 --> 28:56.027
I'm doing a public service. Monsters
on the loose... People have the right to know.

28:56.113 --> 28:59.105
All right. Take as many pictures as you want.

29:00.673 --> 29:03.949
- So, uh, this newspaper you work for...
- New World Weekly.

29:04.033 --> 29:06.263
Right.

29:06.353 --> 29:08.389
If you need any quotes, you know,

29:08.473 --> 29:10.753
something from the law-enforcement
perspective, let me know.

29:10.753 --> 29:13.062
Something from the law-enforcement
perspective, let me know.

29:17.913 --> 29:19.904
To your left.

29:23.073 --> 29:27.430
- Can I get closer?
- Sure thing. Come as close as you want.

29:28.473 --> 29:30.987
Careful. It's dangerous.

29:35.313 --> 29:38.862
- You're never gonna believe this...
- Try me.

29:41.713 --> 29:44.227
- It talks.
- Really? What did he say?

29:45.713 --> 29:47.704
- Max.
- Hey...

29:51.793 --> 29:57.072
Hey, come on, what about us?
Get us out of here!

30:02.513 --> 30:04.868
- Hey!
- Open the gate! Open the gate!

30:27.553 --> 30:31.102
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I got a thing with dogs.

30:38.033 --> 30:40.024
Come on.

31:16.713 --> 31:18.704
Well, after you.

31:34.913 --> 31:37.222
Whoa, what is that smell?

31:45.713 --> 31:48.068
Are those...

31:48.153 --> 31:49.950
tongues?

32:27.433 --> 32:30.152
Guess we shoulda called first.

32:30.233 --> 32:32.667
Why didn't you tell me about him
the other day?

32:32.753 --> 32:34.869
Wanted to.

32:34.953 --> 32:38.946
- We could've done something to stop him.
- Tried to stop him.

32:39.033 --> 32:40.432
I know.

32:40.513 --> 32:43.903
Why's he doing it, Joshua?
Why's he killing people?

32:45.553 --> 32:47.908
Angry.

32:47.993 --> 32:49.984
About what?

32:54.953 --> 32:56.944
Manticore guards.

32:58.473 --> 33:00.987
- They hurt him bad.
- They hurt us all.

33:01.073 --> 33:03.826
You don't know. You don't know.

33:05.633 --> 33:08.272
Little brother was gentle.

33:08.353 --> 33:11.151
Father made him that way.

33:11.233 --> 33:15.431
Then Father was gone.
Lost in all the people and...

33:15.833 --> 33:18.063
Father!

33:19.913 --> 33:22.302
Isaac was sad.

33:23.433 --> 33:25.424
Couldn't stop crying.

33:37.873 --> 33:40.467
So the guards tried to make him stop.

33:41.953 --> 33:42.942
Father...

33:45.393 --> 33:47.907
Father never came back. He was gone.

33:49.073 --> 33:51.064
Isaac wouldn't stop.

33:52.873 --> 33:54.272
So they made him stop.

33:54.513 --> 33:56.708
Father! Father!

34:08.152 --> 34:10.143
The police...

34:11.592 --> 34:16.542
Isaac sees Manticore guards.
That's why he hurts them.

34:28.353 --> 34:30.344
This is great.

34:31.353 --> 34:33.821
Great. This is so great!

34:34.553 --> 34:36.543
Maybe you should try this.

34:40.273 --> 34:43.788
Stay here. Don't open the door,
don't do anything. Stay put.

34:43.873 --> 34:46.467
- Where you going?
- To find Isaac.

34:47.553 --> 34:49.668
- I'II... I'll come.
- No!

34:49.753 --> 34:53.268
The cops are looking for you.
You have to stay here.

34:53.353 --> 34:55.583
Don't hurt little brother.

34:55.672 --> 34:57.664
- Stay put. You hear me?
- You hear me?

34:57.753 --> 35:00.586
- He's killing people, Joshua!
- I'll stop him.

35:00.673 --> 35:04.029
- You tried! Look what he did to you!
- They made him like this.

35:04.113 --> 35:08.470
- Doesn't matter! He still has to be stopped!
- You let him out!

35:08.793 --> 35:11.387
You let us all out!

35:11.993 --> 35:14.143
Now you hurt him?

35:15.353 --> 35:17.503
I won't unless I have to.

35:17.593 --> 35:21.188
- Out of my way, big fella.
- No. I don't think so, little fella.

35:37.673 --> 35:39.470
Joshua!

35:42.513 --> 35:43.273
Joshua!

35:43.273 --> 35:44.467
Joshua!

35:48.353 --> 35:51.743
- Isaac!
- Joshua! Hey, open up.

35:53.153 --> 35:55.348
Where's Max?

35:55.433 --> 35:57.503
Isaac's out there.

35:59.113 --> 36:01.581
Jo... Hey, come back here!

36:03.193 --> 36:05.502
What is it with these guys, huh?

36:07.913 --> 36:09.710
Yeah.

36:18.713 --> 36:20.510
Joshua?

36:27.513 --> 36:29.504
Joshua?

36:55.033 --> 36:57.024
No, Isaac!

36:59.473 --> 37:00.826
No!

37:46.193 --> 37:47.785
Max?

37:47.873 --> 37:49.306
Max?

38:04.673 --> 38:07.426
- Thanks for hanging with me.
- No problem.

38:08.673 --> 38:12.791
I shouldn't have let them out. I should've
known something like this would happen.

38:12.873 --> 38:17.469
- You did the right thing. The only thing.
- Tell that to the families of those dead cops.

38:17.553 --> 38:21.705
- Manticore made Isaac a killer, not you.
- What if there are others like him?

38:21.793 --> 38:26.708
For every one you let out that may be a threat,
you gave 100 others the chance to have a life.

38:26.793 --> 38:28.590
Like him.

38:29.713 --> 38:32.307
Thought you were trying
to make me feel better.

38:32.393 --> 38:34.987
I almost forgot. He gave me this.

38:35.073 --> 38:37.712
Said it was to cover
the money we lost on that doctor.

38:37.793 --> 38:41.422
- Where'd he get it?
- Off some bad guys. All I needed to hear.

38:44.393 --> 38:47.112
- I'm gonna drop by Joshua's.
- How's he doin'?

38:47.193 --> 38:50.708
I don't know. He won't even talk to me,
except to say go away.

38:52.393 --> 38:54.543
Thanks.

38:54.633 --> 38:56.863
Bye.

39:04.633 --> 39:07.625
So what did you say your name was again?

39:07.713 --> 39:10.546
- My friends call me Lux.
- Lux.

39:11.073 --> 39:14.145
- I think you might know some of them.
- Oh, yeah?

39:14.233 --> 39:16.952
Those three guys you went all primitive on.

39:20.713 --> 39:22.510
Nice.

39:26.833 --> 39:28.824
Are you vibrating?

39:31.473 --> 39:33.464
We know what you are.

40:03.113 --> 40:05.832
- Go away.
- I can't.

40:06.113 --> 40:08.673
Joshua, you saved my life.

40:09.273 --> 40:12.982
I'm sorry about your brother,
I really am, but...

40:13.073 --> 40:14.984
I'm glad to be alive.

40:15.513 --> 40:17.708
I want you to be, too.

40:19.433 --> 40:23.267
Brother gone. Not alive any more.

40:24.193 --> 40:26.787
I know.

40:26.873 --> 40:28.864
But I'm here.

40:30.113 --> 40:33.503
And I'm not going anywhere. I'm just not.

40:42.593 --> 40:44.390
You don't have to be alone.

40:45.833 --> 40:48.791
- Tell me about him.
- Why?

40:50.833 --> 40:53.028
Isaac gone.

40:55.273 --> 40:58.026
I wanna know him the way you did.

41:09.793 --> 41:12.148
Isaac...

41:12.233 --> 41:14.224
was Father's favourite.

41:16.033 --> 41:18.422
Must have made you jealous, huh?

41:18.513 --> 41:21.789
At first. Later, no.

41:21.873 --> 41:23.864
Then you got over it?

41:27.833 --> 41:30.301
Little brother...

41:30.393 --> 41:33.191
smaller... gentle.

41:35.633 --> 41:38.705
Father said protect him.

41:45.673 --> 41:47.265
I tried.

41:48.993 --> 41:50.984
You did.

41:53.833 --> 41:56.188
You were a good brother.

42:33.073 --> 42:36.065
