WEBVTT

00:11.344 --> 00:15.056
I need to just, you know, focus on me
and my growth. I have to remember that.

00:15.140 --> 00:19.936
Because I can go into it, knowing it,
and then somewhere in the ch--

00:20.020 --> 00:21.730
In it, I lose it, and I'm like,

00:21.813 --> 00:24.566
I start looking around,
and I'm like, "What am I doing?"

00:24.649 --> 00:28.570
And right now,
this is not the time to, um, to step back.

00:28.653 --> 00:30.572
-It is the time to, like, step up.
-Step up.

00:31.197 --> 00:34.117
For me to win this,
I just have to stay focused

00:34.200 --> 00:35.869
and believe in what I'm doing.

00:35.952 --> 00:40.373
Everybody wants to win, but it's gonna be
the one who really, like, pushes the most.

00:40.457 --> 00:43.752
I wanna make sure
that I can present something good,

00:43.835 --> 00:45.336
but I'm scared if I'm pushing,

00:45.420 --> 00:49.049
I might be doing too much,
and it's gonna bite me in my butt.

00:49.132 --> 00:51.259
About to get cutthroat.

00:51.342 --> 00:53.928
I definitely want those 50,000.

00:54.012 --> 00:56.473
I gotta psych myself up for this.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.892
Things about to get crazy.

01:08.693 --> 01:10.779
-Another day.
-Oh, we open the door?

01:10.862 --> 01:13.990
-Good morning, Amanda.
-Good morning. How's it going?

01:14.074 --> 01:16.242
-It's a new day.
-It's a new day.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.912
-Good morning, everyone.
-Oh my God. Look at that.

01:21.206 --> 01:24.751
-Treasure chest.
-Oh, look at that lotus flower.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.544
Come get a good look at it.

01:26.628 --> 01:29.089
-It? Them.
-Them.

01:29.172 --> 01:30.340
-Them.

01:30.423 --> 01:31.549
At them.

01:32.467 --> 01:33.760
Stop it.

01:33.843 --> 01:35.095
Oh boy.

01:35.178 --> 01:37.180
Oh wow.

01:37.263 --> 01:39.140
Oh,
we got to make two elements?

01:39.224 --> 01:40.266
Really nice.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.644
-That's amazing.
-That's awesome.

01:42.727 --> 01:46.731
As you can see, today
we're going to conduct two demonstrations.

01:46.815 --> 01:47.899
Oh Lord.

01:47.982 --> 01:52.195
Before we do the demo,
let's see what treasures is inside.

01:52.278 --> 01:53.530
You have the key, Carolyn?

01:56.116 --> 02:00.120
I think you're gonna guess
the playfulness of the desserts.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.455
It's something interactive.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.291
-Oh…
-Ah…

02:05.375 --> 02:06.584
That's fun.

02:07.418 --> 02:09.420
-Hinge.
-Oh my God.

02:11.005 --> 02:13.508
-Looks really yummy.
-Tropical.

02:16.094 --> 02:17.470
Ai-ai-ai.

02:17.971 --> 02:21.641
Today, I'm gonna show you
how to create a hinge.

02:22.225 --> 02:25.687
We're going to start
creating a small cylinder,

02:25.770 --> 02:28.189
using tempered dark chocolate.

02:28.273 --> 02:32.986
Removing the excess,
to turn this into an empty cylinder.

02:33.486 --> 02:38.408
Then you can mold a straw,
almost the exact diameter of this guy.

02:38.491 --> 02:42.829
Cut to the right length, create a bar.

02:42.912 --> 02:45.456
Glue the shaft to the central bar.

02:46.249 --> 02:47.917
Apply your chocolating glue.

02:48.501 --> 02:50.253
Here requires some finesse.

02:51.254 --> 02:52.172
My God.

02:54.215 --> 02:58.052
<i>Et voilà</i>. When you see it,
it's actually pretty simple, right?

03:01.181 --> 03:04.934
The mechanics
of how to do little rods and then pieces

03:05.018 --> 03:06.436
so that things can swivel

03:06.519 --> 03:09.606
really kind of blew my mind.

03:09.689 --> 03:12.901
-Which one is your favorite?
-I'm a girl. I'm attracted to the gold.

03:12.984 --> 03:15.612
-I don't… I can't choose.

03:15.695 --> 03:18.114
-The right answer. Thank you, Thiago.
-You're welcome.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.534
Next demo, it's a flower.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.954
I'm gonna show you a way
of making petals quickly.

03:25.038 --> 03:28.166
Using a knife, you dip,

03:28.249 --> 03:29.792
you remove the excess,

03:29.876 --> 03:31.961
you flip over, you press down,

03:32.045 --> 03:34.172
one millimeter, you lift, and you pull.

03:34.255 --> 03:36.549
Before the chocolate fully sets,

03:36.633 --> 03:37.967
we can curve it.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.970
If you want to create a flower
that doesn't exist,

03:41.638 --> 03:43.014
we can make some dots,

03:43.097 --> 03:44.432
playing with the brush.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.310
Anything can be a petal.

03:47.894 --> 03:51.606
This one is actually quite fun.
We're going to pipe some dots.

03:52.857 --> 03:54.901
Those ones are small, they can be long.

03:54.984 --> 03:58.988
Look how quickly
we can get three types of petals,

03:59.072 --> 04:01.157
and that's just a sample.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.867
There is so many ways.

04:02.951 --> 04:05.828
You can have a great variety
in a very short amount of time.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.413
How cool is chocolate, huh?

04:09.582 --> 04:12.669
-Now, we're gonna make things interesting.
-Uh-oh.

04:12.752 --> 04:15.463
Some of you will be doing
the flower challenge,

04:15.546 --> 04:18.216
some of you will be doing
the hinge challenge.

04:18.299 --> 04:20.301
I'm gonna use the group you had yesterday

04:20.385 --> 04:21.678
and divide the class in two.

04:22.470 --> 04:26.849
Stephanie, Tyricia, Cedrick, and Amanda,
you're gonna have four and a half hours

04:26.933 --> 04:29.769
to create a cake with a flower on it.

04:29.852 --> 04:33.064
The flower must represent

04:33.147 --> 04:36.567
or give me a hint of what
I'm going to be discovering inside.

04:37.652 --> 04:42.031
Thiago, Daniel, Mellisa, and Juan,
you're gonna have four and a half hours

04:42.115 --> 04:46.077
to create an interactive pastry
that includes a hinge.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.579
I would love to see
a box of crayons that can open.

04:48.663 --> 04:52.041
-Is that a challenge?
-For real. I leave it to your discretion.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.251
All right, guys.

04:53.334 --> 04:54.419
You may begin.

05:05.596 --> 05:06.639
-Cedrick.
-Hello there.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.934
-What flower are you doing?
-I'm gonna attempt to make a honeysuckle.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.478
-A honeysuckle.
-Yes.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.314
Are you sabotaging yourself, sir?

05:14.397 --> 05:16.482
I mean, we're here
to push ourselves, right?

05:16.566 --> 05:18.735
-This is very challenging.
-I know.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.194
But I really wanna go for it.

05:20.278 --> 05:22.822
They grow all over in the South,
and, um, when I was younger,

05:22.905 --> 05:25.575
we used to, you know,
pick the little stems out,

05:25.658 --> 05:26.701
and the nectar is on it.

05:26.784 --> 05:30.163
They're very sweet. And so that's how
we used to do them when I was younger.

05:30.246 --> 05:33.416
I like that you challenge yourself.
I wonder if it's…

05:33.499 --> 05:35.293
-Too much?
-A little bit difficult.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.880
I mean, honestly,
I'm not gonna let, you know,

05:38.963 --> 05:41.341
whether I'm on the top
or the bottom defeat me.

05:41.424 --> 05:44.218
It's a learning process,
and that's what I'm taking it as.

05:44.302 --> 05:48.056
I didn't wanna do something
that I felt confident with making.

05:49.974 --> 05:51.893
-Stephanie.
-Chef.

05:51.976 --> 05:53.644
What flower did you choose?

05:53.728 --> 05:56.647
-I chose the sunflower.
-Oh, good choice.

05:56.731 --> 05:59.609
I think it represents me.
I'm very happy, and I love the sun,

05:59.692 --> 06:00.860
I love lemon,

06:01.444 --> 06:04.447
and that's kinda what I think about
when I think of a sunflower,

06:04.530 --> 06:06.115
is a bright flavor like lemon.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.868
And so, I'm making
a lemon-and-poppy-seed cake.

06:08.951 --> 06:10.870
The petals itself,

06:10.953 --> 06:15.124
there is ways, multiple ways
of making very realistic sunflower petals.

06:15.208 --> 06:19.379
You can use a knife that's a similar shape
and do the technique I demonstrated.

06:19.462 --> 06:20.296
Yeah.

06:20.380 --> 06:24.550
I was never disappointed
by your texture, your flavor.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.803
You're a good pasrty chef.
You know what you're doing.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.429
But every time,

06:28.513 --> 06:32.141
the detail and the last-minute things
lacked a little bit of refinement,

06:32.225 --> 06:35.061
so today, have some extra time
and do a beautiful flower.

06:35.144 --> 06:38.231
-No gluing points, beautifully crafted.
-Okay.

06:38.314 --> 06:40.274
Ouch, Chef, that hurts.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.360
Bringing it back
to my messy, unclean work.

06:42.944 --> 06:45.154
I have to execute
this chocolate sunflower.

06:45.238 --> 06:48.616
It's just gonna be a really bright dose
of sunshine in your face.

06:48.699 --> 06:50.118
Like, "Take that, Chef."

06:50.201 --> 06:52.912
It's gonna be beautiful, shiny blue sky

06:52.995 --> 06:56.124
with the beautiful yellow sunflower
just basking in the sun.

06:56.207 --> 06:59.210
It's gonna be so bright, he'll get tanned.
He'll feel like he's in California.

06:59.293 --> 07:02.422
He's really gonna appreciate
all the sunshine the sunflowers bring.

07:11.848 --> 07:13.808
I did not expect myself
to be doing

07:13.891 --> 07:16.561
this roller coaster of a performance.

07:16.644 --> 07:19.856
Doing well in chocolate,
doing well in pastry, but then losing.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.108
I'm in this weird position, I think.

07:22.191 --> 07:27.113
This experience has definitely showcased
that I'm very much a chocolatier at first,

07:27.196 --> 07:30.825
and pastry chef is something
I really haven't attained yet.

07:30.908 --> 07:33.035
I'm making a watch box.

07:34.537 --> 07:38.332
Essentially, you're gonna be able to open
the box, see the watch on the top, so…

07:38.416 --> 07:41.502
I'm gonna tell you the same thing
I told Stephanie, but the opposite.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.796
You've never disappointed on the detail,

07:43.880 --> 07:46.007
on the precision,
on the beauty of what you crafted.

07:46.090 --> 07:49.385
-But flavors must kick ass today.
-Yes, Chef.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.554
-Like, that's your main focus, all right?
-Yes, Chef.

07:52.763 --> 07:55.600
The main goal of this pastry
was to make something really good,

07:55.683 --> 07:59.645
which is why I went very, if you will…
not safe, but something I really like.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.857
It was a blueberry cheesecake.
I was like, "I can't screw this up."

08:02.940 --> 08:04.400
If you have questions,

08:04.484 --> 08:07.945
if I can help you achieve those kind
of things that you're missing of,

08:08.029 --> 08:11.532
you know, the certain pastry technique
or base, feel free to ask.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.576
-Yes, Chef.
-I'm… I'm here for you, okay?

08:13.659 --> 08:16.913
I think with this, it's just…
it's just how I've always done it.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.248
-Yeah. So…
-So I never questioned it sometimes.

08:19.332 --> 08:23.336
If I can open this new chapter in pastry,
having really focused in on flavor,

08:23.419 --> 08:26.214
texture, all those aspects
I'm really lacking in right now,

08:27.173 --> 08:29.258
I think
I can still definitely turn this around

08:29.342 --> 08:32.345
and still win the overall award
at the end of the course.

08:32.428 --> 08:34.347
You know,
the top to beat right now is, like,

08:34.430 --> 08:37.558
you know, Thiago, Juan,
Mellisa's up there as well.

08:38.142 --> 08:42.355
Basically, my flavors are gonna be
kind of a riff on blueberry lemonade.

08:42.438 --> 08:44.190
-Beautiful. Simple.
-Yeah.

08:44.273 --> 08:47.151
I brainstormed
what I would open and close,

08:47.235 --> 08:50.738
and then it took me back to my childhood
when I used to pick berries.

08:50.821 --> 08:53.157
As we're moving through this,

08:53.699 --> 08:56.452
when you have 50 grand on the line,

08:56.536 --> 09:00.373
you start to have those doubts
about, "Have you strategized?"

09:00.456 --> 09:03.125
I'm gonna play it a little bit safer.
Tone down the risk

09:03.209 --> 09:05.127
and increase the flavor profile.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.463
-Can you just hold this for me?
-I can.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.048
I don't think I'll get you blue.

09:14.345 --> 09:16.305
I have won two best in class.

09:19.183 --> 09:22.353
It makes me feel
like I'm doing the right thing.

09:22.436 --> 09:25.398
It makes me feel like I'm…
I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing.

09:25.982 --> 09:28.484
This goes here. This goes here.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.069
I picked a ballerina box

09:30.152 --> 09:32.947
because the detail that comes into it,

09:33.030 --> 09:35.157
the tutu is a lot of movement,

09:35.241 --> 09:38.786
so it's… it's something
that will show a lot of skills.

09:38.869 --> 09:40.955
Is it gonna be a silhouette
of a ballerina or…

09:41.038 --> 09:44.041
Yes. Actually, no.
Not a silhouette. Actually ballerina.

09:44.125 --> 09:44.959
-Oh yeah?
-Yeah.

09:45.042 --> 09:47.878
-How do you plan on doing this?
-I don't know.

09:47.962 --> 09:50.006
-Uh, it's--
-I'll figure it out. So, I was thinking…

09:50.089 --> 09:51.632
-It's… It's a bit ambitious.
-Yes.

09:51.716 --> 09:54.510
It's risky, but I'm happy,
and I'm excited for you to try it.

09:56.178 --> 09:57.513
I got so much to do.

10:01.017 --> 10:04.270
I see this yellow color.
I know what it's about, I think.

10:04.353 --> 10:06.230
-Yeah.
-You looking for redemption?

10:06.314 --> 10:07.148
-I am.

10:07.231 --> 10:11.277
The first challenge, I did a crayon box,
small box with a bunch of little crayons.

10:11.360 --> 10:14.113
The box looked like a hot mess.
It was a disaster.

10:14.196 --> 10:16.616
How many more times
will I get a chance to try to, you know,

10:16.699 --> 10:18.993
redeem myself from… from the past?

10:19.577 --> 10:22.288
You're feeling good
on your timing, on all of that?

10:22.371 --> 10:23.497
-So far, yeah.
-Okay.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.958
We'll see where it takes me,
but so far, I feel okay.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.543
I came in with the idea of,

10:27.627 --> 10:30.963
"Let me get the chocolate stuff done
'cause that's where I struggle a bit,

10:31.047 --> 10:33.966
then do the pastry stuff
'cause that I can do in a heartbeat."

10:34.050 --> 10:36.886
I'm gonna go for it.
I just need to be smarter about it.

10:36.969 --> 10:39.221
Chefs,
you have two hours remaining.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.849
-Yes, Chef. Heard.
-Two. Thank you.

10:42.433 --> 10:43.809
-Gosh!
-Ooh, goodness.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.312
Gonna turn that off. Sorry.

10:51.108 --> 10:53.486
I have to make my hand so dainty.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.618
A different type
of science goes with chocolate.

11:00.701 --> 11:02.953
You have to have
a different type of patience for it.

11:03.037 --> 11:07.083
-I don't know what I'm doing.
-That's okay. Is it untempered?

11:07.166 --> 11:11.420
Ye-- The magic temper was added,
but it just… it didn't do right.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.214
Did you Burr mix the magic temper in?

11:13.297 --> 11:14.548
-No.
-That's why.

11:14.632 --> 11:18.302
You really need to break all the molecules
so they can blend inside your chocolate.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.638
-Okay.
-And then you are ready to roll.

11:20.721 --> 11:22.348
-Next time you do it…
-Mm-hmm.

11:22.431 --> 11:25.351
…do only five at a time.
You will have a longer drip.

11:25.434 --> 11:27.770
Because if you do the whole tray,
since the tray is cold,

11:27.853 --> 11:29.897
it's gonna set it
before you can actually tap it out.

11:29.980 --> 11:30.815
Okay.

11:30.898 --> 11:33.067
I am not intimidated by chocolate anymore.

11:33.150 --> 11:36.195
I understand and I appreciate it now.

11:36.278 --> 11:38.948
I'm making this honeysuckle.

11:39.490 --> 11:41.075
I will not be deterred.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.414
Go fast. Faster.

11:46.497 --> 11:48.749
Yeah, there you go. Perfect.

11:48.833 --> 11:51.127
Flowers,
I know I'm not the best at,

11:51.210 --> 11:54.714
and I know they're very meticulous.

11:54.797 --> 11:55.631
Stop, stop.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.426
It's a lot to it,
and it's so easy to mess up.

11:58.509 --> 12:02.054
Don't forget to curve it
before it's too late. Very good.

12:02.138 --> 12:05.307
I'm making up a flower in my head.
It's gonna be whatever I want.

12:05.391 --> 12:08.477
I was staying away
from any real flower because…

12:08.602 --> 12:12.189
…it was so much to compare it to.

12:12.273 --> 12:15.526
Me and my fantasy flower, I'm like,
"He can't tell me it's wrong or not,

12:15.609 --> 12:17.319
because he's not in my head."

12:17.903 --> 12:20.656
-You have a good tempering.
-I learned from the best.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.255
-Stephanie.
-Hi, Chef.

12:36.338 --> 12:37.339
How far are you?

12:37.423 --> 12:41.135
I'm, um, excited to show you
my clean, beautiful flower soon.

12:41.218 --> 12:44.180
-And they're gonna be the prettiest?
-Right. They're beautiful.

12:44.263 --> 12:47.308
-They're gonna be more beautiful.
-Tyricia might disagree with you, but…

12:47.391 --> 12:50.060
Yeah, I was thinking in my head.
I didn't wanna say it.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.396
-Hey, he asked me. I just said, "Yeah."

12:52.480 --> 12:54.231
Yeah, I'm terrified.

12:54.315 --> 12:57.359
And, um… But I'm like,
"Would I really rather do the hinge?"

12:57.443 --> 12:59.153
I'm like,
"I don't know about that."

13:00.946 --> 13:02.114
It's not good.

13:03.991 --> 13:08.454
It was really going well until I was ready
to cut everything to build this box,

13:08.954 --> 13:09.997
and it just didn't work.

13:13.125 --> 13:14.418
I tempered the yellow,

13:14.502 --> 13:17.296
and it wasn't tempered properly,
so…

13:17.379 --> 13:20.466
I don't know what I'm gonna do
to catch up, how I'm gonna catch up.

13:22.134 --> 13:23.761
-Juan?
-Yes, Chef?

13:23.844 --> 13:24.804
How are you doing?

13:25.471 --> 13:27.765
Trying to, uh, assemble this.

13:27.848 --> 13:30.142
Hopefully, I can add some more elements,

13:30.226 --> 13:33.729
but at this point, my goal
is just to have something presented.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.356
Okay. Stay focused.

13:38.234 --> 13:41.111
Of course,
I picked the hardest shape.

13:41.195 --> 13:42.154
Six walls.

13:42.238 --> 13:46.158
I had to make six walls on the bottom,
then I have to make the perfect hexagon,

13:46.242 --> 13:48.744
and I have to line them up
all perfectly, like, level.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.914
So that's 12 pieces
that I have to glue together.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.959
When I could have just literally done
a normal simple box,

13:55.042 --> 13:57.711
and that would be
one, two, three, four pieces.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.171
Should've just done a toy box.

13:59.797 --> 14:02.216
Oh my God.
This is so emotional right now.

14:02.299 --> 14:03.300
I can't take it.

14:05.302 --> 14:08.222
-You okay on time?
-Mm. I could always use more.

14:08.806 --> 14:11.517
-Your hinge is ready to go?
-No. It's right there.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.519
Oh. Oh, okay. All right.

14:14.395 --> 14:17.106
I went with a really thin hinge.
I don't know why.

14:19.024 --> 14:20.442
I should've done a bigger one.

14:20.526 --> 14:23.612
Big, thick, clunky, and foolproof
so that it'd be a bit more sturdy.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.156
I don't know why I think
that when we see Chef do it,

14:26.240 --> 14:27.658
we have to do it kinda his way.

14:32.496 --> 14:33.581
That just snapped.

14:34.498 --> 14:36.750
Oh my God.

14:36.834 --> 14:40.004
Chef, any advice perhaps on the hinge?

14:40.087 --> 14:43.632
Like, it's so thin that I'm losing pieces,

14:43.716 --> 14:46.927
and I can't afford
to lose what I have left over.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.555
Okay, I would just rebuild it,
but just a little thicker?

14:50.347 --> 14:51.348
-Okay.
-You know?

14:52.975 --> 14:53.893
Behind. Under.

14:53.976 --> 14:56.186
The hinge being
such the integral part,

14:56.270 --> 14:59.106
I thought I was gonna knock that out
'cause it was chocolate.

14:59.189 --> 15:02.776
Okay, 15 to make the hinge,
and then 15 to fill the dessert.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.987
Come on, Danny boy. You're doing great.

15:05.571 --> 15:08.616
Fifteen minutes isn't enough time
to build the whole fricking hinge.

15:10.576 --> 15:11.619
Come on.

15:11.702 --> 15:14.121
All right.
Put it away. Put it away. You have plenty.

15:14.204 --> 15:16.624
-Okay. Okay.
-Here.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.253
All right. You all right?
Where are your cakes now?

15:21.337 --> 15:24.590
In the blast chiller. I'm gonna glaze them
one more time with this color

15:24.673 --> 15:26.342
so that it gives them one smooth look.

15:26.425 --> 15:30.554
My area of expertise
is not so much in "entremet" cakes.

15:36.143 --> 15:37.561
So when I went to put my glaze on,

15:37.645 --> 15:41.523
I, um, didn't account for the extra chill
that my cakes were gonna be taking in,

15:41.607 --> 15:44.360
so that instantly made
my mirror glaze, like, seize up

15:44.443 --> 15:46.946
and not get a smooth shine on the outside.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.822
No. Not gonna work.
It's just not gonna work.

15:48.906 --> 15:51.617
But I'm gonna go over it with the white,
and it's gonna be fine.

15:52.409 --> 15:54.745
Chefs, you have 15 minutes in total.

15:54.828 --> 15:56.789
-Yes, Chef.
-Thank you.

16:02.836 --> 16:03.963
Shoot me.

16:04.546 --> 16:05.756
Ugh, come on, pants.

16:11.387 --> 16:12.846
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.723
Slap me in the face, you know?

16:14.807 --> 16:17.476
That crayon is beating me over the head,
and I can't get it right.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.395
-Hinge, okay?
-Yeah.

16:19.478 --> 16:21.689
-Like, 100% hinge time.
-Yeah. Yep.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.858
Beautiful. Perfect, perfect.

16:26.151 --> 16:28.320
Ugh, come on, Miller. Don't melt it.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.781
That was gorgeous. Don't melt it.

16:38.831 --> 16:42.126
Three, two, one.

16:43.252 --> 16:44.586
It's over.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.632
Chefs, can you bring forward
your creations, please?

17:01.270 --> 17:03.439
You cannot really compare
apples to oranges,

17:03.522 --> 17:06.400
so we're gonna have the best
of the exercise for the flower,

17:06.483 --> 17:09.528
and we're gonna have the best
of the exercise for the hinge.

17:10.779 --> 17:12.948
Stephanie, please come forward.

17:13.532 --> 17:16.744
This is my sunflower entremet.

17:16.827 --> 17:18.537
You are not messing around, no?

17:18.620 --> 17:21.623
-No. I wanted it life-size.
-You have that Italian roots.

17:21.707 --> 17:24.418
Yeah. Like my grandma says,
"You go big or you go home."

17:24.501 --> 17:25.335
Yeah?

17:25.419 --> 17:27.087
I do like the flower.

17:27.171 --> 17:31.508
It's symmetrical. It's well-built.
You did different lengths. It… It's nice.

17:32.092 --> 17:34.636
Uh, sunflower seeds are very underrated,

17:34.720 --> 17:36.305
and we don't see them very much,

17:36.388 --> 17:40.684
so I'm glad that you give me a vision,
and I know what I'm eating inside.

17:40.768 --> 17:43.854
I know you removed the glaze,
which was a bold move,

17:43.937 --> 17:47.775
but I'm glad you did, because, this way,
I'm not gonna have that thick of a glaze.

17:47.858 --> 17:50.944
But because you remove the glaze,
you don't have something as smooth.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.198
Let's cut this.

17:54.281 --> 17:56.200
I've made
a lemon <i>sablé </i>on the bottom,

17:56.283 --> 17:57.993
and then a creamy sunflower praline,

17:58.077 --> 18:02.664
and a lemon-and-poppy-seed sponge cake.
There's a honey meringue in the middle,

18:02.748 --> 18:06.585
sandwiched in between two more layers
of lemon cake and lemon curd.

18:07.419 --> 18:10.589
I loved
that I got a lot of sunflower.

18:10.672 --> 18:13.801
That's the direction
you were going for. I like it. It's nice.

18:13.884 --> 18:15.761
But, overall, a bit sweet.

18:16.345 --> 18:19.473
-Thank you, Chef.
-Thank you, Stephanie. All right. Tyricia.

18:20.933 --> 18:26.647
-What am I looking at today?
-A tropical exotic flower on an entremet.

18:26.730 --> 18:30.234
I do like the flower.
It's symmetrical. It's open.

18:30.317 --> 18:33.987
You do give me the feeling
of your own spin on a tropical flower,

18:34.071 --> 18:37.324
but I think, overall, it could be cleaner.

18:38.534 --> 18:39.493
Let's try this.

18:42.246 --> 18:44.248
-Oh yeah? That much?

18:44.331 --> 18:45.999
I don't know.
I always get nervous.

18:46.875 --> 18:48.293
It's well-built.

18:48.377 --> 18:51.505
Everything is straight.
The glaze is good, and it's shiny. Okay.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.676
My flavors are pineapple,
rum, and vanilla.

18:55.759 --> 18:57.761
-The mousse is nice. Good texture.
-Okay.

18:57.845 --> 19:00.139
-Thank you, Tyricia.
-Thank you, Chef.

19:02.057 --> 19:03.016
Amanda.

19:05.352 --> 19:06.687
I like the flower.

19:06.770 --> 19:07.771
You show skills.

19:07.855 --> 19:10.732
I can see through the petals.
You're giving them two dimensions.

19:10.816 --> 19:15.404
You used a spatula, which gives
a unique look that we don't often see.

19:15.487 --> 19:18.407
So now it will come down to the taste.

19:18.490 --> 19:21.160
Um, inside, you will find a coconut mousse

19:21.243 --> 19:23.954
with a pineapple compote gel,

19:24.037 --> 19:26.748
and a banana cream insert,

19:26.832 --> 19:30.460
and banana cake soaked
in pineapple simple syrup.

19:31.044 --> 19:34.464
When all the elements separate like this,
you know there is a gelatin issue.

19:39.553 --> 19:40.846
That's very unfortunate, Amanda.

19:40.929 --> 19:43.932
Because it's very good,
but it's very, very stiff.

19:45.517 --> 19:48.270
-Cedrick.
-Here is my creation.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.148
I wanted to make honeysuckles.

19:51.231 --> 19:53.275
I know it was
a difficult flower to attempt,

19:53.358 --> 19:55.235
but I really wanted to try it.

19:55.319 --> 19:57.821
The flower, you took on a challenge.

19:57.905 --> 20:01.867
I'm very happy with what you did
because it's very proportional.

20:01.950 --> 20:05.204
You could have colored
the white chocolate in white

20:05.287 --> 20:07.164
so that the flower is brighter,

20:07.247 --> 20:09.333
and then, boom, it's in my face.

20:09.416 --> 20:13.462
The glaze is very thin,
which, for me, it's very important.

20:13.545 --> 20:17.507
-I hope, uh, it's gonna be very good.
-I hope so too.

20:17.591 --> 20:20.177
There is a honey madeleine at the bottom,

20:20.260 --> 20:24.264
an almond cake,
and a honey-rosemary <i>crémeux</i> at the top.

20:26.600 --> 20:30.562
I like all the components.
It's simple, and it's smooth. It's nice.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.356
Good job. Thank you, Cedrick.

20:35.275 --> 20:37.694
For the flower exercise, it was tough

20:37.778 --> 20:41.156
because, for many reasons,
some of you were very close.

20:41.698 --> 20:45.035
The best in the exercise…

20:49.414 --> 20:50.249
…is Cedrick.

20:50.332 --> 20:52.376
-Oh!

20:55.712 --> 20:57.965
-Well, thank you, Chef.
-You worked for it.

20:58.048 --> 21:00.509
Yes, yours was minimalistic,

21:00.592 --> 21:03.845
however, it had a lot
of different technique and detail to it.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.848
Something I could see
sell somewhere no problem.

21:06.932 --> 21:10.102
-First time making a flower. Right?
-Yeah.

21:10.185 --> 21:13.313
I was surprised, in all honesty.
In the past, I would hate chocolate,

21:13.397 --> 21:15.691
but now I… I don't hate it anymore.

21:15.774 --> 21:20.028
I'm coming to an agreement with it,
if that makes sense.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.739
Now, for the team
who worked on the hinge. Daniel.

21:26.368 --> 21:29.913
Once again, you've proved that you have
that craft and sense of detail.

21:30.580 --> 21:32.165
So let's see the hinge.

21:32.249 --> 21:33.709
That's the fun part, right?

21:33.792 --> 21:35.961
When you open it,
you get a little surprise.

21:36.712 --> 21:38.588
I'm gonna be very delicate. Okay?

21:38.672 --> 21:42.801
So, I'm gonna open
and close to see if it works.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.600
-It's a bit loose.
-Loose. Yep.

21:50.684 --> 21:54.313
At least it opens and closes.
It's pretty much almost aligned.

21:54.896 --> 21:56.231
Pressure.

21:58.233 --> 22:00.944
My heart rate is at, like,
3,000 right now, through the nose.

22:12.039 --> 22:14.124
-It's very good.
-Oh. Jesus Christ!

22:15.417 --> 22:17.377
God, Chef! Oh my God! I'm sorry!

22:17.461 --> 22:19.629
-Oh my God!

22:19.713 --> 22:22.758
You went simple.
The baked cheesecake is just right.

22:22.841 --> 22:23.759
Good job, Daniel.

22:25.969 --> 22:27.137
Mellisa, you're next.

22:28.597 --> 22:30.349
So,
this is my berry picking box.

22:30.432 --> 22:32.100
I had one as a little girl.

22:32.184 --> 22:35.228
I like the…
the texture. It's a very fancy box.

22:35.312 --> 22:38.607
I do like that you made the hinge thinner.

22:38.690 --> 22:42.361
And I will hope that you'll be as careful
with my hinge.

22:42.444 --> 22:44.863
-And I will.
-'Cause I… I'll have a heart attack.

22:46.073 --> 22:47.199
Let's open it.

22:50.952 --> 22:52.412
It is opening…

22:56.083 --> 22:59.044
and it is closing.

23:00.670 --> 23:04.299
Textures are extremely soft.
This is what I want.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.801
It's sexy, you know?

23:05.884 --> 23:07.094
You want to try it.

23:08.595 --> 23:10.931
Inside, berry, almond sponge,

23:11.014 --> 23:13.475
lemon curd, and a crème fraîche custard.

23:15.310 --> 23:17.479
You have a nice work
on the compote itself.

23:17.562 --> 23:20.273
The pungent is very good.
I like the variety of texture.

23:20.357 --> 23:22.359
-Thank you, Mellisa.
-Thank you, Chef.

23:23.610 --> 23:27.406
-Juan, please step forward.

23:27.489 --> 23:29.741
I'm presenting a ballerina box.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.618
A music box, pretty much.

23:32.119 --> 23:35.080
I do love the color.
Love the little sparkle.

23:35.163 --> 23:37.499
You got me used to cleaner job,

23:38.083 --> 23:39.292
but it's cute.

23:40.127 --> 23:42.671
-Just be careful.
-Just be careful now?

23:43.255 --> 23:44.089
Please?

23:47.259 --> 23:49.136
I'm a very cautious customer.

23:49.636 --> 23:54.474
You really went heavy on the chocolate,
which can jeopardize the opening,

23:54.558 --> 23:57.811
because it's so much tension
you put on the hinge itself.

23:57.894 --> 24:02.315
This is nice, because you…
I do appreciate the ultra detail.

24:02.399 --> 24:04.860
But, uh, where is my ballerina?

24:06.528 --> 24:09.781
-She ran away.
-Yeah? She was tired?

24:09.865 --> 24:14.244
I would've loved you spend no time on this
and put a ballerina inside the mousse.

24:14.327 --> 24:18.081
Even if you put streusel on the mousse,
she's dancing in the dirt, I don't care.

24:18.165 --> 24:20.792
And then I open, and I have a surprise.

24:20.876 --> 24:22.502
I open, and I'm not surprised.

24:24.629 --> 24:26.047
-Should I?
-Yes.

24:27.132 --> 24:31.261
On the bottom, we have a chocolate cake,
vanilla flan with a passion fruit caramel,

24:31.344 --> 24:33.388
and a chocolate, uh, mousse.

24:35.765 --> 24:38.143
I'm not saying the flan isn't good.

24:38.226 --> 24:41.229
-I don't know if it fits this dessert.
-Okay.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.564
It's quite a lot.

24:46.026 --> 24:47.152
All right.

24:47.694 --> 24:50.739
Last but not least, Sir Thiago.

24:52.240 --> 24:55.243
I brought a little drawing
this time for you as well.

24:55.327 --> 24:56.161
All right.

24:56.244 --> 24:59.623
Imagine, like, a kid at the table,
that's paradise for him, right?

24:59.706 --> 25:00.582
So much fun.

25:00.665 --> 25:03.919
And I'm still in between the lines.
I had a lot of training, though, so…

25:05.253 --> 25:08.048
Do you want to tell me
what you like about it?

25:08.131 --> 25:10.800
I like that I got the lid on
with the hinge this time.

25:10.884 --> 25:15.514
What I dislike is a lot of the detail work
that I did early on didn't really pan out.

25:15.597 --> 25:17.224
Overall, it's a little bit messy.

25:17.307 --> 25:19.059
-You know, the overall look.
-I know.

25:19.142 --> 25:22.437
The box itself, I mean, it's…
it's actually one of the most lined up.

25:22.521 --> 25:25.106
-Does it work?
-If you're very delicate, yeah.

25:25.190 --> 25:28.193
I will. I will give equal chance
to everyone.

25:31.112 --> 25:32.572
I can fully open it,

25:32.656 --> 25:34.074
so you did good on that.

25:34.157 --> 25:36.952
And the inside crunchy element
is inside the crayon.

25:37.035 --> 25:38.370
-I just open it?
-Yeah.

25:40.789 --> 25:43.333
-I did good, huh?
-Oh, that was good.

25:43.416 --> 25:46.211
I do love the effect, huh?
It's kinda cool.

25:46.294 --> 25:48.713
It's a take
on a strawberry tres leches.

25:51.550 --> 25:52.717
It's pleasing.

25:52.801 --> 25:55.929
The crunch, by the way,
will always remain crunch

25:56.012 --> 25:58.473
because nothing is in contact with it,
so that's smart.

25:58.557 --> 26:00.767
But it's disappointing coming from you.

26:00.850 --> 26:03.228
Four hours,
it's not enough to challenge yourself

26:03.311 --> 26:05.772
on something even bigger
than the first one you wanted.

26:05.855 --> 26:08.358
And I don't know
why you keep on sabotaging yourself.

26:08.441 --> 26:12.237
I'm fearing that I won't be able to see
the best of Thiago.

26:15.156 --> 26:17.617
Now, for the team who worked on the hinge,

26:17.701 --> 26:24.165
this was even harder because I had
two of you that were extremely close.

26:24.249 --> 26:29.921
Daniel, I really appreciate that today
you focused not only on the aesthetic,

26:30.005 --> 26:31.548
but also the taste.

26:32.465 --> 26:33.425
And, Mellisa,

26:33.508 --> 26:37.512
you really, uh, challenged yourself
on a lot of teeny, tiny details,

26:37.596 --> 26:40.098
and the flavors were very accurate.

26:41.308 --> 26:43.685
Today, the… the winner of the exercise…

26:46.187 --> 26:47.022
is Mellisa.

26:53.486 --> 26:55.488
-Congratulation to you.
-Thank you, Chef.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.907
Internally, I was pretty proud of myself.

26:57.991 --> 26:59.701
I really wanted to beat Daniel

26:59.784 --> 27:02.787
because I need to make sure
that my scores are staying high,

27:02.871 --> 27:04.789
or it's just gonna be a boys club
at the end here,

27:04.873 --> 27:06.750
andthat's… that's no fun for anybody.

27:07.584 --> 27:11.212
As professionals,
we're facing difficult challenges.

27:11.296 --> 27:13.590
Chef, it's not only about crafting,

27:14.090 --> 27:15.967
it's also about managing.

27:16.051 --> 27:19.179
We're asked to cut in budget,

27:19.763 --> 27:20.764
save money,

27:21.765 --> 27:22.807
fire people.

27:24.601 --> 27:26.853
Today I'm gonna ask
the leader of both groups

27:26.936 --> 27:28.855
to make a difficult decision.

27:29.939 --> 27:32.567
Within your group, I'm gonna ask you

27:32.651 --> 27:34.819
to select the person
that won't be moving on

27:34.903 --> 27:36.112
to the chocolate exercise.

27:39.157 --> 27:40.784
Thank God I didn't win.

27:40.867 --> 27:43.203
'Cause I would not
wanna be in that position.

27:44.746 --> 27:48.041
Oh, well, that s… sucks.

27:48.124 --> 27:51.378
I know all three of these guys
don't wanna sit this round out,

27:51.461 --> 27:55.757
and one of them is going to, and one
of them is gonna be pretty mad at me.

27:56.675 --> 27:59.386
It's part of making tough calls.

28:00.095 --> 28:01.721
You can take five minutes.

28:01.805 --> 28:04.724
-You can convey within your group.
-Yes, Chef.

28:04.808 --> 28:05.642
Yes, Chef.

28:06.184 --> 28:07.686
All right, my flower people.

28:07.769 --> 28:10.438
-I'll be right here.
-Okay, my box people.

28:11.064 --> 28:14.526
-Uh…
-I think you should just…

28:14.609 --> 28:16.403
-I don't know. It's hard.
-Just what?

28:16.486 --> 28:19.489
Just pick.
You figure it out, and you pick.

28:19.572 --> 28:20.532
I have.

28:25.161 --> 28:27.747
I have to go into work mode.
No emotion.

28:27.831 --> 28:28.832
Okay.

28:29.332 --> 28:30.750
Anybody wanna volunteer?

28:38.466 --> 28:41.469
Look, I… I'm just gonna say,
like, I was second to you,

28:41.553 --> 28:47.016
so like, considering that the premise
was if you do well in pastry, you move on,

28:47.100 --> 28:51.104
I think I should continue on chocolate
because I was able to do well enough.

28:51.187 --> 28:52.772
-That's a good answer.
-Yeah.

28:53.273 --> 28:54.816
It's between me and him.

28:55.442 --> 28:59.112
We both didn't do great today.
He still gave me the harshest critique,

28:59.195 --> 29:02.782
so it should be me if anybody
out of this group should sit out.

29:02.866 --> 29:06.661
It's a decision. It's okay.
Nobody's gonna get angry.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.621
He hasn't done
one chocolate challenge,

29:08.705 --> 29:11.082
so from a score-wise perspective,

29:11.875 --> 29:14.836
you have the most wiggle room to sit out,

29:14.919 --> 29:16.212
so I'm just asking…

29:16.296 --> 29:18.131
I do think that's unfair.

29:18.214 --> 29:20.008
-You think it's unfair?
-Yes.

29:20.091 --> 29:24.053
I don't think it should be based
on how I have done in the past.

29:24.679 --> 29:27.348
I was trying to think of it
from an analytical way,

29:27.432 --> 29:32.145
and he got offended for sure and was like,
"You're going about it the wrong way."

29:32.228 --> 29:34.314
In my mind, I'm thinking,
"In your opinion."

29:34.397 --> 29:37.400
You know, just because it's your opinion,
doesn't mean it's 100% right.

29:38.026 --> 29:41.654
Mellisa, who will not be participating
to the next chocolate exercise?

29:44.282 --> 29:46.326
It's okay. Say a name. It's fine.

29:49.370 --> 29:50.914
-Juan.

29:53.666 --> 29:57.003
Yeah, Juan can afford to sit one out.
I think Juan would have had me sit out.

29:57.086 --> 29:59.631
I'm not in the bro club.
Give me a break.

29:59.714 --> 30:01.382
Thank you for your decision.

30:03.092 --> 30:05.804
-Cedrick, have you come to a decision?
-I have.

30:06.846 --> 30:09.432
Who would you like to remove
for the next exercise?

30:11.768 --> 30:15.104
Unfortunately, I will be removing
Stephanie from the next exercise.

30:16.648 --> 30:20.276
There was nothing ill-will
towards her for it.

30:20.360 --> 30:24.906
It was basically, out of the four of us,
who hasn't sat out for a chocolate round.

30:24.989 --> 30:27.242
In all fairness to everyone,

30:27.325 --> 30:29.911
um, I thought that would be
the easiest route to go.

30:34.916 --> 30:37.168
-You okay?
-Yeah, I just…

30:37.252 --> 30:40.255
Yeah, I'm fine. This is just based
off nothing that we're doing.

30:40.338 --> 30:41.172
Right.

30:41.256 --> 30:44.342
I was furious inside. I was fuming.

30:44.425 --> 30:46.803
I was so mad. My blood was boiling.

30:46.886 --> 30:50.765
I could not believe
something that unfair had just happened.

30:56.229 --> 30:58.857
I'm… I'm glad I didn't win.

30:58.940 --> 31:00.108
I know, right?

31:00.191 --> 31:02.777
It's not about winning,
it's about being fair.

31:03.278 --> 31:07.949
The decision for Cedrick to pick her
was easy because, out of the four of us,

31:08.032 --> 31:10.618
she's the only one
that hadn't sat out a chocolate round.

31:10.702 --> 31:13.663
And so it was kind of
out of fairness, maybe?

31:14.831 --> 31:18.042
I don't wanna eat anything.
I'm so sick to my stomach right now.

31:19.836 --> 31:21.754
Mellisa sees me as a threat,

31:21.838 --> 31:24.007
which is… I mean, she should.

31:24.090 --> 31:28.136
So that's why she maybe decided
that it's actually better just to,

31:28.219 --> 31:31.055
"Get him out for this one
so he doesn't get another win."

31:31.139 --> 31:33.641
Definitely, it was just a really low blow.

31:34.142 --> 31:36.477
I feel bad.
I feel like it should be me, not you.

31:36.561 --> 31:38.730
You just better kick ass
on the showpiece.

31:38.813 --> 31:41.232
Mellisa picked him
because he's more of a competition.

31:41.316 --> 31:44.485
That's what I would've done.
I mean, it's still a competition, right?

31:44.569 --> 31:48.531
For me, it's good, because then maybe
I can demo some more things on my side.

31:49.073 --> 31:51.326
Thiago, you have got to show up,

31:51.409 --> 31:54.287
because he's gonna be really pissed
tomorrow if you don't.
