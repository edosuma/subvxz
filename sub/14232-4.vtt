because I need

13:51.832 --> 13:53.631
an electric beak groomer.

13:53.633 --> 13:56.467
Keeps the tip sharp
while brightening my smile.

13:57.803 --> 13:59.804
Oh, clerk peasant.

13:59.806 --> 14:02.674
Bring me your finest
beak groomer.

14:02.676 --> 14:05.109
Sorry, that's not
my department.

14:05.111 --> 14:07.912
I want the name
of your supervising wizard.

14:09.381 --> 14:10.582
Halt!

14:10.584 --> 14:13.484
Those who wish
to pass my lair,

14:13.486 --> 14:15.787
answer my riddles
if you dare.

14:15.789 --> 14:17.488
- I do not breathe--
- A leg.

14:17.490 --> 14:18.690
- But I run.
- A leg.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.959
- And jump.
- A leg!

14:20.961 --> 14:23.995
And... wait. How could you
possibly know that?

14:23.997 --> 14:26.130
- The internet.
- Internet?

14:26.132 --> 14:28.700
You should look it up.
Now come on, come on.

14:28.702 --> 14:31.035
- Open up.
- [sighs wearily]

14:31.037 --> 14:32.670
Thank you.

14:32.672 --> 14:35.673
You ever hear of
the internet, skeleton door?

14:35.675 --> 14:38.376
[silence]

14:38.378 --> 14:41.779
Okay, it should be
right through here.

14:43.415 --> 14:45.550
Gnome repellent?
Extra-strength ghost heads?

14:45.552 --> 14:47.151
We're right back
where we started.

14:47.153 --> 14:48.987
How is this
even possible?

14:48.989 --> 14:51.556
Let's see.
Made a right turn,
another right turn.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.025
Another right turn,
then another right turn.

14:54.027 --> 14:55.627
This makes no sense!

14:55.629 --> 14:57.695
Well, well, well.

14:57.697 --> 14:59.898
Looks like Quest Buy
really does have

14:59.900 --> 15:01.699
everything a monster
could want.

15:01.701 --> 15:04.535
- Ludo!
- Now hand over
that wand,

15:04.537 --> 15:07.572
or there's going to be
a big clean-up on aisle...

15:07.574 --> 15:09.774
uh, what aisle is this?

15:09.776 --> 15:11.843
That's not my department.

15:13.445 --> 15:16.881
Rainbow Avalanche!

15:18.050 --> 15:20.685
Uh, just give me
a sec here.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.020
Uh...

15:22.022 --> 15:23.855
Narwhal Nightmare!

15:25.958 --> 15:28.493
Get me that wand!

15:30.796 --> 15:32.630
Big Boy Diaper Blast!

15:39.038 --> 15:40.471
Oh, no.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.774
This doesn't look
familiar at all.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.776
You know what?
We tried this your way.

15:44.778 --> 15:47.612
Now we're gonna try this
the organized way.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.881
Hmmm.
I think I got it.

15:49.883 --> 15:52.450
That elevator will take us
right to the charger department.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.718
Come on.

15:56.989 --> 15:58.856
Hold the door
there, folks.

15:58.858 --> 16:01.993
Oh, close, close, close!

16:03.562 --> 16:04.996
Thanks, guys.

16:13.539 --> 16:15.473
There it is.

16:15.475 --> 16:18.176
Don't worry, little wand.
We're almost there.

16:18.178 --> 16:19.644
Told ya I'd get us there.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.513
We stopped.

16:24.550 --> 16:28.553
Sorry, folks,
this elevator's
no longer in service.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.855
Welcome to
the booby trap department.

16:30.857 --> 16:32.490
Please step carefully...

16:32.492 --> 16:34.492
- [gasps]
- Don't help me up.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.227
- I get workers' comp
for this.
- [elevator bell dings]

16:39.665 --> 16:42.166
See ya later, guys.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.002
Guys?

16:45.838 --> 16:48.573
- Get 'em!
- [screams]

16:48.575 --> 16:51.509
Ow. Ow. Ow.
Ow. Ow.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.877
Look out.

16:52.879 --> 16:54.545
Blades of doom.

16:57.716 --> 16:59.183
Massacre darts.

17:05.958 --> 17:08.826
A hallway with walls that
smash together periodically.

17:12.931 --> 17:14.999
We made it.

17:16.735 --> 17:18.269
There's so many chargers.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.271
We'll never find
the right one in time.

17:20.273 --> 17:22.140
Oh, yes, we will.

17:22.142 --> 17:25.610
Because this time,
we're gonna get organized.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.845
I'll figure this out.
You go hold off the monsters.

17:27.847 --> 17:30.615
Right.

17:30.617 --> 17:31.816
There she is.

17:39.124 --> 17:43.661
You're not gonna tell
my boss about this, are you?

18:00.646 --> 18:02.346
Well, well, well.

18:02.348 --> 18:04.682
It looks like Mama's
havin' pork chops for supper.

18:06.785 --> 18:07.985
[clucking angrily]

18:11.190 --> 18:12.623
[yelling]

18:12.625 --> 18:14.692
- [gasps]
- [ angry cluck]

18:22.334 --> 18:25.303
Beak 'N' Trim.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.904
I found it.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.742
Ludo, I found it.

18:39.218 --> 18:41.953
Marco, where are you?

18:41.955 --> 18:43.688
I found the charger!

18:43.690 --> 18:45.723
It took me a while,
but once I figured out

18:45.725 --> 18:47.625
they were using
the metric system...

18:47.627 --> 18:49.760
Just give me
the cock-a-doodie charger!

18:51.630 --> 18:53.197
Yes! I got it!

18:53.199 --> 18:56.334
Yes. I've got it!
Finally.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.936
Evil is in
the palm of my hand.

18:58.938 --> 19:02.473
Prince Blast Your Face Off!

19:04.176 --> 19:08.012
Spinning Dizzy
Death Blast!

19:08.014 --> 19:10.381
[frustrated groan]

19:10.383 --> 19:12.216
Ka-pow!

19:12.218 --> 19:14.085
What's wrong with
this thing?

19:16.421 --> 19:18.656
[excited laughter]

19:20.425 --> 19:22.293
[whinnies]

19:25.097 --> 19:26.430
So cute.

19:26.432 --> 19:29.267
Fantastic Exit Beam!

19:30.736 --> 19:32.403
Are you gonna pay for
that charger, ma'am?

19:32.405 --> 19:36.007
My arch-nemesis will cover it.
He kinda owes me.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.909
- You do realize that
we could just walk?
- I know.

19:37.911 --> 19:41.012
I had it right in
my claws.

19:41.014 --> 19:43.214
So you're the one
who's paying for this mess?

19:47.219 --> 19:51.689
Uh, I must've dropped
my wallet in the fight.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.291
[nervous giggle]

19:53.293 --> 19:54.458
[ferocious growl]

19:57.930 --> 19:59.864
Ah, we're back.

19:59.866 --> 20:02.033
You see, Star,
it pays to be organized.

20:02.035 --> 20:04.335
- If you'd just
listened to me--
- Oh, shut it.

20:04.337 --> 20:07.305
On Earth, it's rude
to tell people to shut it.

20:07.307 --> 20:11.309
Yeah, that's rude
on Mewni, too. Look.

20:11.311 --> 20:14.111
- My mini-vac.
- It's possessed.

20:14.113 --> 20:16.814
- I'm gonna touch it.
- No, don't touch it.

20:18.283 --> 20:19.850
Oh, she's touching it.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.888
Just my charger.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.324
My charger?!

20:26.326 --> 20:29.026
Uh... whoops.

20:29.028 --> 20:30.394
I must've accidentally
sucked it up

20:30.396 --> 20:32.296
when I was cleaning. Sorry.

20:32.298 --> 20:34.332
Guess you have two now.

20:34.334 --> 20:37.735
Nah, you keep it.
I've got my wand.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.104
You've got a magic
floating vacuum cleaner.

20:40.106 --> 20:42.006
Now we're both cool.

20:44.376 --> 20:46.410
Whoa!
