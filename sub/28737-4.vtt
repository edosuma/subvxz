WEBVTT

00:01.096 --> 00:04.280
Mr Stewart. You probably
know Sean Brody from Walford.

00:04.300 --> 00:06.259
Yeah. G'day, Jake. Been a while.

00:06.260 --> 00:08.019
Rita Connors, Narelle Stang.

00:08.020 --> 00:09.379
Doesn't he mean Rita Harris?

00:09.380 --> 00:12.063
Does anyone else in here
know that you're a copper?

00:12.340 --> 00:15.101
First thing I'm gonna do when I get
out of here is get a fuckin' root!

00:15.131 --> 00:16.859
I'd love a good fuck.

00:16.860 --> 00:19.860
Do you regret what you did? To Marie?

00:19.985 --> 00:22.596
So you can guarantee me she's
not going to attack Winter again?

00:22.597 --> 00:23.899
No, I don't think she will.

00:23.900 --> 00:25.755
He got bashed by a
bunch of feral bitches

00:25.756 --> 00:27.299
who thought he was beating up some girl.

00:27.300 --> 00:29.099
Do you remember that guy
we put in a wheelchair?

00:29.100 --> 00:30.404
The guy we got the wrong intel on?

00:30.418 --> 00:32.769
His sister is in H1. Narelle Stang.

00:32.780 --> 00:35.059
- I need access to the internet.
- What for?

00:35.060 --> 00:37.779
To print off some documents
that could help with my appeal.

00:37.780 --> 00:39.339
If you get in trouble in the future...

00:39.340 --> 00:42.129
Just don't even think about
starting your shit up in here.

00:45.010 --> 00:46.875
- Hey, what's up?
- It was me.

00:46.927 --> 00:50.831
I attacked your brother.
I am the Red Right Hand.

00:51.611 --> 00:53.967
I want you to do something else for me.

00:54.092 --> 00:57.033
I want you to kill Kaz Proctor.

02:13.482 --> 02:17.039
- Fuck!
- Sorry. Couldn't sleep.

02:18.541 --> 02:20.348
That makes two of us.

02:20.473 --> 02:23.529
I was just up checking on
Lizzie. She gets the wanders.

02:23.749 --> 02:25.455
She worries me.

02:25.516 --> 02:28.530
- She's lucky to have you.
- Well, you know, she's family.

02:28.655 --> 02:30.153
All you girls are.

02:31.989 --> 02:34.520
Oh, here she is. Sorry, did we wake you?

02:34.540 --> 02:38.026
No, love. No. God, I was
tossing and turning and...

02:38.991 --> 02:42.927
- Hey, you guys, can you shut up?
- Sorry, we couldn't sleep.

02:42.980 --> 02:44.940
Hey, Rubes, if you're up,
can you get the bikkies?

02:44.978 --> 02:46.147
Fine.

02:46.156 --> 02:48.184
Oh, who's got the bikkies?

02:48.211 --> 02:52.170
- Oh, God, here we go.
- 'Cause me tummy's grumbling.

02:52.180 --> 02:54.739
Oh, well, come and sit
down, love. Come on.

02:54.740 --> 02:57.259
- I was having another sexy dream, eh?
- Ahh.

02:57.260 --> 03:01.570
Yeah, you chickened out of your
conjugal, so I went instead.

03:02.260 --> 03:06.059
'Cause, like, that's
what mates do, eh? Yeah.

03:06.097 --> 03:10.200
And I went in there and
Dr Miller was in there.

03:10.220 --> 03:13.669
- Dr Miller.
- He was just lying there, starkers.

03:13.706 --> 03:15.784
- Mmm.
- Then what happened?

03:16.460 --> 03:18.113
Then youse bitches woke me up.

03:18.238 --> 03:21.116
- Mate, it was them!
- Sorry, Booms, did not.

03:21.134 --> 03:22.372
It was all of you.

03:23.614 --> 03:26.139
Oh, I love it when it's like this.

03:26.140 --> 03:28.682
It's just all of us
hanging out together.

03:28.807 --> 03:31.431
- I miss Allie, though.
- Mmm.

03:32.380 --> 03:35.464
- Mind if I crash?
- Mmm, course not.

03:35.820 --> 03:38.099
Booms was just saying that
we wrecked her sexy dream.

03:38.100 --> 03:40.970
- Youse did.
- I had a nightmare.

03:41.095 --> 03:43.019
- Oh, love, that's not good.
- Mmm.

03:43.020 --> 03:44.888
- What happened?
- Oh, it was about my arrest.

03:44.911 --> 03:46.570
Not this one, the one before.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.659
I got shot by this bitch
who was working for the cops.

03:49.660 --> 03:51.711
- What, like, undercover?
- Yeah.

03:52.146 --> 03:53.790
I just keep seeing her face.

03:53.820 --> 03:55.664
You know, it's like it's haunting me.

03:56.982 --> 03:58.200
Way to kill the mood!

03:58.201 --> 04:00.180
- I preferred Boomer's dream.
- Yeah, me, too.

04:00.181 --> 04:01.905
- Me, too.
- Me, too.

04:01.940 --> 04:03.809
Yeah, it was pretty good.
Yeah, one more second,

04:03.812 --> 04:06.047
I would've jumped on him
like a seagull on chips.

04:06.074 --> 04:07.980
Oh, yeah.

04:09.931 --> 04:11.343
With gravy.

04:15.140 --> 04:16.535
How're you feeling?

04:16.589 --> 04:18.660
Oh, God.

04:18.863 --> 04:20.075
Good to be out.

04:20.261 --> 04:23.580
One more night in Medical,
I would have opened a vein.

04:23.820 --> 04:25.130
It's good to see you.

04:26.435 --> 04:27.620
What do you want?

04:27.621 --> 04:30.219
Just so you know, I'm not
interested in starting a war.

04:30.220 --> 04:31.249
Really?

04:31.284 --> 04:33.939
'Cause last time I looked, you
were tossing a bomb into my cell.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.061
Far as I'm concerned, we're done.

04:40.135 --> 04:41.360
What'd you say to Marie?

04:42.426 --> 04:44.889
I told her she had
nothing to worry about.

04:45.178 --> 04:47.340
Good. Thanks.

04:47.940 --> 04:49.649
Didn't do it for you.

04:54.780 --> 04:56.780
The best of that shit.

04:58.496 --> 05:01.386
- What the fuck's this?
- Delivery inspection. Deal with it.

05:01.679 --> 05:03.432
How are we supposed to serve breakfast?

05:03.441 --> 05:05.052
You can do it after we've finished.

05:05.931 --> 05:07.183
Whoa.

05:15.697 --> 05:17.415
You'll be having breakfast in the slot.

05:17.437 --> 05:19.459
Oh, that's bullshit. It
has nothing to do with me.

05:19.460 --> 05:20.627
You're in charge of the kitchen.

05:20.651 --> 05:22.059
Yeah, but it doesn't
mean she knew about it.

05:22.060 --> 05:23.949
Yeah, he's right. Anyone
could have put it there.

05:23.958 --> 05:25.032
- Just because I'm in charge
- Listen, you're going...

05:25.037 --> 05:26.490
- of the kitchen doesn't mean...
- Alright, settle down.

05:26.514 --> 05:27.775
What's going on?

05:29.200 --> 05:31.055
- I found this.
- It's not mine.

05:31.126 --> 05:33.861
Jesus. OK, everyone out. Let's go.

05:39.580 --> 05:42.123
- I was about to slot her.
- How do you know it was her?

05:42.867 --> 05:45.548
- Because I know these prisoners.
- Brody's right.

05:45.625 --> 05:47.619
You can't slot her without proof.

05:47.620 --> 05:49.539
Oh, come off it. We
both know she's a dealer.

05:49.540 --> 05:52.367
I want to start building a
relationship between us and the women.

05:52.492 --> 05:53.687
Now, we can't do that

05:53.704 --> 05:56.001
if they're getting chucked
in the slot without evidence.

05:56.126 --> 05:58.990
Just keep an eye on her.
Search the rest of the kitchen

05:58.995 --> 06:01.201
- before you let them back in.
- Yes, Mr Jackson.

06:04.801 --> 06:07.042
Don't ever contradict me
in front of a prisoner.

06:07.052 --> 06:10.179
- Oh, whatever you say, Jakey.
- Why were you sticking up for her?

06:10.180 --> 06:12.962
- Hey? Were you in on this, too?
- Of course not.

06:12.980 --> 06:15.159
- Bullshit.
- You heard the man.

06:15.387 --> 06:16.802
Where's your evidence?

06:23.440 --> 06:25.135
Get the fuck out of my cell.

06:25.154 --> 06:27.191
You should've shivved her last night.

06:27.213 --> 06:30.080
- You had plenty of opportunity.
- Oh, yeah.

06:30.158 --> 06:32.544
That'd be smart, in a locked unit.

06:32.616 --> 06:35.734
- You really need to think about this.
- I have thought about this.

06:36.060 --> 06:37.317
I've thought about it every day

06:37.339 --> 06:39.615
since Jimmy got the
shit kicked out of him.

06:39.647 --> 06:42.419
Take it from me,
revenge is a shit-fight,

06:42.420 --> 06:44.414
and it won't make you feel any better.

06:45.113 --> 06:48.643
- And I'm no killer.
- Well, that's not what you told me.

06:48.926 --> 06:51.562
And that's not what everyone else says.

06:51.839 --> 06:53.038
Still,

06:53.770 --> 06:55.807
they don't know you like I do.

06:58.553 --> 07:00.484
I want her gone.

07:02.315 --> 07:03.880
Reets.

07:07.149 --> 07:08.764
Is that your parole?

07:09.407 --> 07:11.294
Yeah, my hearing's next week.

07:11.333 --> 07:14.379
- I might be gettin' out in a fortnight.
- Oh, that's deadly, Roo.

07:19.835 --> 07:21.596
Stang knows, doesn't she?

07:21.849 --> 07:24.459
- She was fucking with you last night.
- Yeah.

07:24.460 --> 07:27.049
- Why didn't you tell me, Rita?
- I didn't wanna worry you.

07:27.265 --> 07:29.535
You know, you don't always
have to be the big sister.

07:29.557 --> 07:30.800
Hey.

07:31.055 --> 07:35.117
- I'll take care of it.
- If she tells, they'll kill you.

07:35.838 --> 07:37.451
I just need some time to think.

07:37.464 --> 07:39.059
Don't the cops plan
for something like this?

07:39.060 --> 07:41.992
Well, normally, they do.
But right now I'm not a cop.

07:42.117 --> 07:43.684
I'm nobody.

07:44.784 --> 07:47.531
- Can I have a tray, love?
- Yeah.

07:47.542 --> 07:48.812
Thanks, love.

07:49.001 --> 07:52.014
Oh, pancakes. Yes. OK,
you're having a big breakfast.

07:52.025 --> 07:54.628
- We've gotta get your strength back up.
- Oi. Allie.

07:54.933 --> 07:57.974
- Oh, hey, just give me a second, OK?
- Sure.

08:00.365 --> 08:04.555
So, I spoke to Smiles. She's
charging 200 bucks for the paperwork.

08:04.610 --> 08:07.203
- So, what, how much is the man-ho?
- $300.

08:07.258 --> 08:09.855
- Oh, yeah.
- I can't afford 500 bucks for a shag!

08:09.872 --> 08:13.073
Sh, sh! It's alright, we've
done a whip around. It's fine.

08:13.198 --> 08:15.598
Love, I'm not a charity case.

08:15.648 --> 08:18.195
Look, this whole thing
feels like a bad idea.

08:18.220 --> 08:21.014
- I just think we should cancel it.
- No!

08:21.139 --> 08:23.300
Hey, I need some gear.

08:23.571 --> 08:25.575
You're out of luck.
Screws found my stash.

08:25.602 --> 08:27.159
OK, so when are you getting more?

08:27.160 --> 08:29.775
Fuck knows. They'll be
watching the kitchen now.

08:29.798 --> 08:31.607
Well, how about I get
you moved to the laundry?

08:31.621 --> 08:33.000
Then you can use hotel deliveries.

08:33.072 --> 08:35.114
They're not going to
move me on your say so.

08:35.308 --> 08:38.904
Leave it with me. But in
return, I want a discount.

08:39.029 --> 08:41.780
- Sure, if you can do it.
- Watch me.

08:44.843 --> 08:48.505
- They call it 'pork sword'.
- Hey, what about your breakfast?

08:55.541 --> 08:56.856
Mr Jackson.

08:57.433 --> 08:59.019
Hey, I'm running late for a meeting.

08:59.020 --> 09:01.295
I need Kosta moved to the laundry.

09:01.783 --> 09:03.745
I've got to have some muscle on my side

09:03.746 --> 09:05.473
just in case Kaz tries anything.

09:05.500 --> 09:08.287
Well, Dr Miller's been working with Kaz.

09:08.353 --> 09:09.899
He doesn't think she's a threat anymore.

09:09.900 --> 09:11.899
Neither do I. I mean, she seems OK.

09:11.900 --> 09:13.314
Yeah, but I don't
want to take that risk.

09:13.331 --> 09:15.894
She's a fuckin' nutjob. Please.

09:15.900 --> 09:20.100
Sierra 3, this is Sierra
6. You're needed in Admin.

09:20.777 --> 09:22.409
Yeah, copy that.

09:23.335 --> 09:26.087
Let me think about
it. Sorry, I gotta go.

09:41.974 --> 09:43.728
Everything's looking good.

09:44.305 --> 09:46.258
You still don't want to know the sex?

09:46.383 --> 09:48.412
No, I think I know.

09:48.806 --> 09:50.210
It's a boy.

09:50.426 --> 09:53.140
- You want me to tell you?
- No, it's OK.

09:54.272 --> 09:56.420
Oh, no, alright. Go on.

09:56.902 --> 09:58.196
- You sure?
- Yep.

09:59.694 --> 10:01.692
Actually, it's a girl.

10:04.766 --> 10:06.900
Oh. OK.

10:07.191 --> 10:09.938
- Great.
- Congratulations.

10:16.997 --> 10:18.506
Yes?

10:18.956 --> 10:20.293
Is everything alright?

10:21.247 --> 10:23.633
Linda said you swapped
shifts to go to the hospital.

10:23.867 --> 10:25.316
Well, that was discreet of her.

10:26.470 --> 10:28.099
Well, is the baby OK?

10:28.100 --> 10:30.077
Yes, it was an ultrasound appointment.

10:30.360 --> 10:32.740
- Did you get any photos?
- No.

10:35.454 --> 10:37.619
Well, do you know if
it's a boy or a girl yet?

10:37.620 --> 10:39.278
No, no. I...

10:39.627 --> 10:42.635
no, I've actually got
things to do, so...

10:57.873 --> 11:00.580
How's business? All dried up?

11:00.626 --> 11:03.107
Not for long. I'm moving to the laundry.

11:03.407 --> 11:05.116
Jackson's transferring me.

11:05.132 --> 11:07.019
Got my eye on that steam press.

11:07.020 --> 11:08.607
Over my dead body.

11:08.635 --> 11:10.743
Might have to take you up on that.

11:14.484 --> 11:17.499
- Why the fuck is Kosta moving to the laundry?
- What?

11:17.500 --> 11:19.156
She said you were transferring her.

11:19.545 --> 11:21.387
I haven't decided either way.

11:21.418 --> 11:24.564
- Why are you even considering it?
- Because of you, Kaz.

11:25.389 --> 11:28.339
- Look, Marie's scared of you.
- Fuck off. No, she's not.

11:28.340 --> 11:31.094
Look, I'm grateful to you for trying
to smooth things over, but she...

11:31.115 --> 11:33.080
she doesn't feel safe around you.

11:35.284 --> 11:38.780
She is playing you
like a fuckin' fiddle.

11:40.202 --> 11:42.748
- What do you mean by that?
- I mean,

11:43.541 --> 11:46.731
your girlfriend is running the show.

11:48.305 --> 11:49.961
Yeah, that's right.

11:50.737 --> 11:52.675
I know you're fucking her.

11:55.400 --> 11:57.196
Let me out.

12:04.361 --> 12:06.500
Oh, fuck.

12:17.224 --> 12:18.397
You wanted to see Winter?

12:18.836 --> 12:20.775
Yeah, thank you, Mr Stewart.

12:20.806 --> 12:22.511
Can you close the door, please?

12:26.196 --> 12:28.380
Proctor knows about us.

12:28.563 --> 12:30.571
I don't know how, but
if she tells anyone,

12:30.588 --> 12:33.002
I'm fucked and so are you.
She's probably out there now,

12:33.003 --> 12:35.934
- telling someone who'll listen...
- Will, calm down, all right?

12:36.895 --> 12:39.402
Everyone knows that she
has a grudge against me,

12:39.403 --> 12:41.975
so we will just deny it.
We'll say she's lying.

12:42.001 --> 12:44.379
She's the Top Dog.
Everyone will listen to her.

12:44.380 --> 12:46.419
Vera respects her. There'll
be an investigation.

12:46.420 --> 12:48.321
All right, well, if she
hasn't said anything yet,

12:48.343 --> 12:49.705
can't you just put her in Protection?

12:49.722 --> 12:52.723
- Get her away from the women?
- That's a red rag to a fuckin' bull.

12:53.081 --> 12:55.751
- So I'll talk to her.
- And say what?

12:56.435 --> 13:00.478
Well, hopefully, come up with some
kind of plan to keep her quiet.

13:02.383 --> 13:04.614
What, you got a better idea?

13:06.388 --> 13:08.841
Shit, I'm sorry, Will. Hey?

13:13.872 --> 13:16.099
You haven't got Kosta
for backup, either.

13:16.100 --> 13:18.903
She's been shooting her mouth off.
She's mopping floors from now on.

13:25.389 --> 13:26.984
Be careful.

13:37.475 --> 13:38.859
Mind if I join you?

13:39.179 --> 13:41.182
I have Tim Tams.

13:41.855 --> 13:45.383
- I'm trying to watch my blood sugar.
- They're double-coat.

13:46.876 --> 13:48.938
Oh, you're a bad influence.

13:54.799 --> 13:56.689
So, how many weeks to go?

13:57.628 --> 13:58.871
Uh, ten.

13:59.929 --> 14:02.175
Exciting. A brand-new human.

14:02.181 --> 14:04.797
I'm not actually feeling excited yet.

14:05.177 --> 14:07.082
Just kind of apprehensive.

14:07.158 --> 14:10.442
My sister was petrified the
entire time she was pregnant.

14:10.724 --> 14:12.254
But the minute she saw her baby boy,

14:12.265 --> 14:14.862
that fear just went out the window.

14:15.289 --> 14:17.232
I was convinced it was a boy.

14:17.449 --> 14:18.914
It's a girl?

14:22.675 --> 14:23.844
You OK?

14:23.871 --> 14:27.090
I was fine, until today.
It's just a bit of a shock.

14:30.086 --> 14:31.514
I'm sorry.

14:32.366 --> 14:36.214
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
unload on you like that.

14:36.469 --> 14:39.721
No, look, I don't mind at all.
I'll send you my bill later.

14:44.100 --> 14:47.959
The thing is I wasn't
close to my mother.

14:48.469 --> 14:50.152
She was difficult.

14:51.851 --> 14:55.780
Cold. But she was the
only parent I had, so...

14:57.142 --> 15:01.565
So what if I end up like her and
what if my daughter ends up like me?

15:01.580 --> 15:04.455
What if it's just
history repeating itself?

15:04.495 --> 15:06.145
Parenting isn't genetic.

15:06.531 --> 15:08.175
It's learned behaviour.

15:08.203 --> 15:09.755
I learned from the worst.

15:09.804 --> 15:11.682
Well, then you know the mistakes.

15:11.904 --> 15:14.319
- You know what not to do.
- Maybe.

15:15.665 --> 15:18.237
Maybe I am just a
cliché, blaming my mother

15:18.243 --> 15:19.945
for all the things
that are wrong with me.

15:21.017 --> 15:24.436
Look, you want to be a good mum.

15:25.185 --> 15:27.763
That determination is all you need.

15:29.337 --> 15:31.514
You'll be amazing, Vera.

15:38.765 --> 15:41.344
I'm so nervous. It's been a long time.

15:41.345 --> 15:43.264
You look so beautiful.

15:43.389 --> 15:45.816
- I don't look like a hooker?
- No, not at all!

15:45.859 --> 15:47.878
Oh. Birdsworth. Your escort's here.

15:50.185 --> 15:51.883
You can do this.

15:53.077 --> 15:56.437
I am gonna shag him senseless.

15:57.294 --> 15:58.858
Thanks, Kaz.

15:59.602 --> 16:01.285
OK. Righto.

16:08.009 --> 16:09.974
So, what do you want, to keep quiet?

16:10.490 --> 16:13.418
Look, I realise you don't
care if I get lynched,

16:13.419 --> 16:15.439
but think what'll happen to Will, right?

16:15.445 --> 16:17.898
May lose his job, maybe worse.

16:19.105 --> 16:21.585
- So what do you want?
- Finish it.

16:22.158 --> 16:26.020
Whatever fucked-up thing you
have going with Jackson, it ends.

16:26.145 --> 16:27.602
Now.

16:30.705 --> 16:32.319
You have my word.

16:32.785 --> 16:34.251
It's over.

16:39.950 --> 16:41.865
Kaz'll keep quiet.

16:42.345 --> 16:43.623
- You sure?
- Well,

16:43.634 --> 16:45.887
short of cutting her throat,
there's no guarantees.

16:46.012 --> 16:47.862
We can't be seen together.

16:50.745 --> 16:52.551
So much for my fucking transfer.

16:52.578 --> 16:55.748
Well, next time, keep your mouth
shut. You fucked this up, not me.

16:56.562 --> 16:59.004
- Trouble with Kosta?
- What?

16:59.129 --> 17:03.775
Oh, I've just been watching you
two. You seem a little bit... tense.

17:04.505 --> 17:06.905
We haven't properly met yet.

17:07.025 --> 17:08.833
I'm Officer Brody.

17:09.289 --> 17:12.127
- Marie Winter.
- Oh, yeah, I've been reading all your files.

17:12.883 --> 17:15.238
- I feel like I know you already.
- I doubt that.

17:15.265 --> 17:17.848
- I'm a pretty good judge of character.
- Me, too.

17:21.505 --> 17:23.102
I can help you.

17:23.785 --> 17:25.647
If you need a fix.

17:27.367 --> 17:29.624
- So what's the catch?
- No, there's no catch.

17:29.749 --> 17:32.100
I supply and you pay. End of.

17:32.296 --> 17:34.022
I'll think about it.

17:48.225 --> 17:50.612
- I believe you two know each other.
- No, we haven't...

17:50.618 --> 17:52.610
- Wrong answer.
- I mean, yes, of course.

17:52.637 --> 17:55.100
This is my partner, Victor.

17:55.122 --> 17:56.865
- Vince.
- Vince!

17:57.521 --> 17:59.388
You kids enjoy yourselves.

18:02.625 --> 18:05.140
Uh, I'm, um...

18:05.342 --> 18:08.409
- I'm a little bit nervous. I'm sorry.
- Don't be nervous.

18:08.631 --> 18:11.709
Why don't you come here and sit
down? Make yourself comfortable.

18:12.545 --> 18:14.075
OK.

18:15.105 --> 18:16.403
So, um...

18:16.707 --> 18:20.094
So, you... you, uh...
you do this a lot, then?

18:20.145 --> 18:21.824
- Yeah.
- Oh.

18:21.825 --> 18:24.446
Oh, if that's a breath mint,
maybe I should have one.

18:24.665 --> 18:27.507
- It's Viagra.
- Right.

18:27.545 --> 18:28.875
OK.

18:30.009 --> 18:31.762
I look that bad?

18:32.105 --> 18:33.792
You look lovely.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.733
OK, thanks.

18:38.465 --> 18:40.504
You maybe want to
start getting undressed?

18:40.505 --> 18:41.950
Yeah.

18:42.225 --> 18:43.676
OK.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.464
Think she's bluffin'?

18:57.465 --> 19:00.665
She'll blab unless I do what she wants.

19:00.825 --> 19:02.825
And what's that?

19:05.505 --> 19:07.505
Reets, tell me.

19:09.465 --> 19:12.940
- She wants me to kill Kaz.
- What? Why?

19:13.131 --> 19:15.737
'Cause the Red Right Hand
fucked up her brother.

19:17.265 --> 19:19.797
- You're not gonna do anything about it, are ya?
- Nah, of course not.

19:19.821 --> 19:21.354
So I'm screwed.

19:22.865 --> 19:24.874
You gotta go into Protection.

19:24.922 --> 19:27.609
- Today.
- Nah. Then they'll come after you.

19:28.825 --> 19:31.036
There's only one other option.

19:33.825 --> 19:35.497
Kill Stang.

19:36.145 --> 19:38.559
Every night before I fall asleep,

19:38.895 --> 19:40.909
I see Drago's face.

19:41.769 --> 19:43.985
I can still smell her blood.

19:46.145 --> 19:48.147
I can't do that again.

20:07.428 --> 20:09.965
So, I did what you wanted.

20:10.033 --> 20:12.401
- I told Mr Jackson we're finished.
- Good.

20:12.422 --> 20:15.583
So we're done? Hmm? We got a deal?

20:18.825 --> 20:21.636
- Have we got a deal?
- No.

20:21.968 --> 20:24.024
There's something else.

20:24.025 --> 20:25.659
Allie.

20:25.944 --> 20:27.158
What about her?

20:27.219 --> 20:29.790
You tell Allie the truth
about you and Mr Jackson.

20:29.858 --> 20:33.176
- Ahh, nah, I can't do that.
- You don't have a choice.

20:33.237 --> 20:35.008
I love her. I won't do it.

20:35.035 --> 20:37.559
You've got a funny way
of showing your love.

20:37.586 --> 20:41.104
- Fucking somebody else.
- Your word against mine.

20:41.105 --> 20:43.024
She'll see who's lying.

20:43.025 --> 20:45.706
- This is gonna break her heart.
- I know.

20:45.740 --> 20:48.557
But maybe one day,
she'll thank us for it.

20:56.145 --> 20:58.870
She deserves so much better than you.

21:18.218 --> 21:19.589
What are you doing?

21:19.888 --> 21:22.602
Just checking my phone.
What do you think I'm doing?

21:22.727 --> 21:24.346
What else you got in there?

21:24.780 --> 21:26.198
Just my gym gear.

21:26.781 --> 21:30.153
If you want a sniff,
just... you let me know.

21:40.205 --> 21:42.195
- Problem with your locker?
- Yeah,

21:42.229 --> 21:44.380
these things get stuck all the time.

22:04.389 --> 22:06.214
- You right?
- Yep.

22:06.614 --> 22:09.301
Actually, I was just wondering, um...

22:11.641 --> 22:13.724
has Vera been talking about me?

22:14.036 --> 22:15.739
No.

22:16.397 --> 22:19.084
She's vulnerable at the
moment. Just so you know.

22:19.132 --> 22:21.513
- Right.
- I don't want anyone taking advantage.

22:21.547 --> 22:25.895
- I beg your pardon?
- No, I'm just looking out for her, that's all.

22:25.929 --> 22:27.625
I don't think Vera needs you, or me,

22:27.626 --> 22:31.452
- or any other man to look out for her.
- Yeah, no, I didn't mean it like that.

22:31.577 --> 22:33.884
Look, Jake, we're just friends.

22:34.009 --> 22:35.885
She hardly knows you.

22:39.912 --> 22:41.934
I know what she thinks about me.

22:43.291 --> 22:45.085
But I can be a good dad.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.925
I can be a great dad,
if I'm given the chance.

22:47.945 --> 22:50.652
You really should be
talking to her about this.

22:51.982 --> 22:54.717
Yeah, yeah, I know. You... I'm sorry.

22:54.900 --> 22:57.017
Just take it easy.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.805
Give her some space.

22:59.744 --> 23:02.702
That baby has parents
that want the best for her.

23:02.750 --> 23:04.744
That's the most important thing.

23:07.947 --> 23:09.765
What did you say?

23:11.170 --> 23:12.965
Is she having a girl?

23:15.241 --> 23:16.849
Oh, wow!

23:18.701 --> 23:22.513
Oh, my God, that Viagra does
the trick, doesn't it, love?

23:22.527 --> 23:27.378
I mean, you were so...
so, um, enthusiastic.

23:28.328 --> 23:29.963
Oh, my God!

23:30.017 --> 23:33.960
Oh, you can come back next
week if you like, love.

23:36.593 --> 23:38.954
I'm only joking, Vince.

23:40.439 --> 23:42.205
Are you OK?

23:43.925 --> 23:45.786
Vince?

23:51.647 --> 23:53.099
Oh.

23:53.224 --> 23:54.979
Oh, shit.

23:55.165 --> 23:57.442
Oh, my God.

24:00.196 --> 24:03.256
- What are you doing?
- Get dressed! I... I need your help.

24:06.669 --> 24:09.477
- I think he's dead.
- Is this a joke?

24:09.511 --> 24:11.418
Please, just check him.

24:15.461 --> 24:18.019
- Oh, fuck!
- Oh, my God!

24:18.046 --> 24:19.586
- Close the door!
- But what do we do?

24:19.590 --> 24:21.586
Close the bloody door
and get dressed! Oh, God.

24:21.607 --> 24:23.500
- Everything OK?
- Oh, God! No!

24:23.526 --> 24:25.046
Sean, get in here and shut the door.

24:28.476 --> 24:30.381
- What, he's not... ?
- Yes.

24:30.506 --> 24:32.205
What the fuck happened?

24:33.833 --> 24:36.742
- I'm gonna lose my job.
- What? No, you're not.

24:36.769 --> 24:39.320
I faked the paperwork.
He's a sex worker.

24:39.331 --> 24:40.569
What?

24:40.601 --> 24:43.114
This is not funny. The
coroner'll find out. I'm fucked!

24:43.125 --> 24:45.241
OK, OK, hang on. Just...
just let me think.

24:45.247 --> 24:46.945
What are you going to do, resurrect him?

24:46.951 --> 24:48.579
I don't wanna be here.

24:48.612 --> 24:50.088
I'll take you back to H1.

24:50.121 --> 24:52.287
Do not say a word about what happened

24:52.314 --> 24:54.132
or I'll put you in the
Psych Unit, you got it?

24:54.198 --> 24:56.097
- Yeah.
- Come on!

24:58.003 --> 24:59.951
Hey, hey. Hey!

25:00.429 --> 25:03.414
Head back to the reception.
Shred the paperwork.

25:03.718 --> 25:06.850
- What?
- Just calm down. Focus.

25:06.877 --> 25:09.271
Shred the papers, go to the CCTV room,

25:09.276 --> 25:11.224
turn the camera off in the loading dock.

25:11.550 --> 25:13.743
- Where're you gonna take him?
- Out of the prison.

25:13.759 --> 25:15.974
Go, before someone else comes in here.

25:17.879 --> 25:19.154
You told Miller?

25:19.762 --> 25:22.862
I am the father and I have to
beg you for the slightest detail,

25:22.878 --> 25:24.202
for a fucking crumb,

25:24.327 --> 25:26.280
and you tell him it's a girl!

25:26.308 --> 25:27.903
- Jake...
- No, I don't wanna hear it.

25:27.920 --> 25:30.465
- You can't justify that. It's bullshit!
- Look, calm down.

25:30.487 --> 25:32.902
Are you for real? You don't
get how messed up that is?

25:32.908 --> 25:35.285
I didn't realise he was going
to blab it around the prison.

25:36.348 --> 25:38.139
I am the father.

25:38.264 --> 25:41.705
Yes, but I get to make decisions
about who I tell and when.

25:41.738 --> 25:45.104
I want to be involved. You
can't keep shutting me out.

25:46.081 --> 25:48.702
I am trying my hardest.

25:48.729 --> 25:52.138
I'm trying to make this
prison safer, for you.

25:52.155 --> 25:55.356
And that's all I can do because
you won't let me do anything else.

25:55.975 --> 25:58.894
You don't get to play
the victim card, Jake.

26:18.807 --> 26:21.554
- I'm so, so sorry.
- Do you think, in future,

26:21.602 --> 26:23.492
you could check with
people before disclosing

26:23.519 --> 26:26.819
- their private information to other staff?
- I just presumed he knew.

26:27.319 --> 26:29.034
Yeah, well, he does now.

26:40.821 --> 26:42.232
Hey.

26:47.785 --> 26:49.131
What did, um...

26:49.489 --> 26:51.291
what did Kaz say to you before?

26:51.758 --> 26:54.526
Oh, she just apologised.

26:55.871 --> 26:57.988
- Wow.
- Yeah.

26:58.949 --> 27:00.463
So...

27:02.330 --> 27:04.821
- is that the end of it?
- Mmm.

27:13.217 --> 27:14.965
Do you miss Ruby?

27:15.979 --> 27:18.769
- What?
- Do you miss her?

27:20.169 --> 27:23.572
- I'm with you.
- Yeah, I know.

27:23.632 --> 27:26.748
But, you know, it happened
pretty quickly. I was just,

27:27.139 --> 27:31.182
you know, wondering if maybe
this was a rebound thing.

27:31.947 --> 27:34.360
Why would you think that?

27:34.770 --> 27:38.015
Marie, I love you.

27:38.617 --> 27:41.385
- Do you?
- Yes.

27:42.199 --> 27:43.979
What's going on?

27:48.576 --> 27:50.769
I'd go crazy without you.

27:50.894 --> 27:53.977
Hey. I'm not going anywhere.

27:55.150 --> 27:58.227
I think you're still in
shock after what happened.

27:59.540 --> 28:01.325
I'm here, OK?

28:01.950 --> 28:03.573
I'll protect you.

28:04.522 --> 28:06.936
Winter, your lawyer's here.

28:06.937 --> 28:08.891
Yeah, give us a minute, will you?

28:09.927 --> 28:12.228
Come find me afterwards, OK?

28:48.374 --> 28:50.620
- Turn the cameras back on.
- Where is he?

28:50.621 --> 28:52.211
He's in the boot of my car.

28:52.222 --> 28:54.518
I'm gonna dump him in the
park after my shift tonight.

28:54.578 --> 28:56.538
You're gonna leave him in
your boot all afternoon?

28:56.585 --> 28:58.580
Yeah, well, he wouldn't fit
in the staff-room fridge.

28:58.604 --> 29:00.357
This is not fuckin' funny!

29:00.411 --> 29:05.415
I'm not gonna dump him in broad
daylight. Stop freakin' out, hey?

29:05.421 --> 29:07.278
He died of natural causes,

29:07.516 --> 29:10.697
- as long as you ditched the paperwork.
- I didn't sign him in.

29:11.414 --> 29:13.422
You wiped the CCTV?

29:15.652 --> 29:16.960
Home and dry.

29:17.975 --> 29:21.401
- I owe you, big time.
- Damn right you do.

29:35.609 --> 29:38.952
Now, this is just a sample,
right? I've got worse.

29:39.017 --> 29:41.079
So you make it clear

29:41.128 --> 29:43.983
that unless he gets my
conviction overturned,

29:44.282 --> 29:46.247
I'm gonna be leaking this to the press,

29:46.269 --> 29:48.651
to the police and to his fucking mother.

29:48.665 --> 29:50.269
All right?

29:55.246 --> 29:56.901
Jesus.

29:57.710 --> 30:01.879
I want me and Allie Novak...

30:01.905 --> 30:03.747
out of here.

30:04.290 --> 30:05.798
Leave it with me.

30:08.385 --> 30:09.891
Thank you.

30:20.300 --> 30:22.487
Still working on that appeal?

30:23.812 --> 30:25.554
Don't need to.

30:37.710 --> 30:39.973
- Nothin'! I just asked her how he was.
- Well, you must have said something to her!

30:39.979 --> 30:41.442
- Look how upset she is!
- I didn't upset her!

30:41.466 --> 30:43.577
- She was fine before she left!
- Hey, cut it out!

30:43.615 --> 30:45.697
- But she won't even talk to me, will she?
- I wonder why, Boomer!

30:45.721 --> 30:47.425
What the fuck happened?

30:47.550 --> 30:49.716
- I don't know.
- We have no idea.

30:49.841 --> 30:51.940
This isn't helping. Piss off.

30:52.651 --> 30:54.925
- Quick.
- Why're you blaming me?

31:05.818 --> 31:08.049
Honey, it's just me.

31:11.034 --> 31:12.945
Did something happen?

31:14.758 --> 31:17.113
Did that man do something to you?

31:18.825 --> 31:20.294
Liz?

31:20.614 --> 31:23.735
- I'm gonna get Dr Miller...
- Do you think I'm crazy?

31:24.143 --> 31:26.504
No, but something's wrong.

31:28.344 --> 31:31.274
You think I'm fuckin' crazy.

31:31.649 --> 31:33.646
Hey? And you...

31:33.771 --> 31:36.604
you wanna fuckin' shove me. Fuck!

31:36.729 --> 31:38.227
I'm gonna fuck...

31:38.238 --> 31:41.988
Don't you fuckin' speak
to me like a fuckin' child!

31:42.025 --> 31:44.550
You're not gonna get rid of me! No!

31:44.583 --> 31:46.358
'Cause I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!

31:46.374 --> 31:48.540
I'm gonna put my hands
on fuckin'... fuckin'...

31:48.556 --> 31:50.224
- No!
- You fucking...

31:50.304 --> 31:51.976
Stop it!

31:52.014 --> 31:54.522
- What the hell's going on?
- Get off me!

31:54.554 --> 31:56.280
Get the hell off me!

31:56.324 --> 31:58.842
- What the hell's going on?
- Get Dr Miller, quick. Quick!

31:58.865 --> 32:05.756
- Get her off me! Get her off me!
- Sh! Sh. Sh, Lizzie. Sh.

32:11.434 --> 32:14.501
Attention, Compound. Count
will commence in five minutes.

32:14.555 --> 32:16.627
It was a psychotic episode.

32:17.203 --> 32:19.428
She seemed fine. I don't
know what brought it on.

32:20.057 --> 32:22.384
Could it be a reaction
to your medication?

32:22.509 --> 32:24.589
No-one's reacted like this before,

32:24.605 --> 32:27.080
but I'll lower the dose
just as a precaution.

32:27.373 --> 32:29.305
- Keep me posted.
- Yeah.

32:35.828 --> 32:37.584
You need to get back to your unit.

32:37.585 --> 32:38.797
- No...
- Count's in five.

32:38.819 --> 32:40.680
Can I stay with her, please?

32:43.155 --> 32:45.830
- I'll clear it with Mr Jackson.
- Thank you.

33:16.119 --> 33:17.296
Where's Kaz?

33:17.302 --> 33:19.706
She's staying with Liz tonight
in Medical. I can't get to her.

33:19.728 --> 33:22.946
This is bullshit. You're not gonna
do it. You're just buying time.

33:23.017 --> 33:25.160
What do you want me
to do? She's not here.

33:25.204 --> 33:27.630
I told you, I want her dead.

33:27.711 --> 33:30.425
By tomorrow, you'll have
nothing to worry about, OK?

33:32.889 --> 33:34.668
You got till lunchtime.

33:49.756 --> 33:51.092
Free sample.

33:51.146 --> 33:55.760
- Very generous of you.
- Nah, not really. That's quality shit.

33:55.798 --> 33:58.430
Next few days, you're gonna
be begging me for more.

33:58.664 --> 34:01.752
And that's when you start paying. Right?

34:13.166 --> 34:14.630

35:56.945 --> 35:59.584
Hey. How's she going?

35:59.611 --> 36:01.424
Oh, she's still asleep.

36:01.549 --> 36:04.705
- Have you been in there all night?
- Mm-hm.

36:05.744 --> 36:08.704
- You're a good friend, Kaz.
- Come on, Novak.

36:08.705 --> 36:11.280
- Piss test. See ya.
- See ya.

36:12.105 --> 36:13.790
Hey.

36:14.385 --> 36:16.465
How's things with Marie?

36:16.865 --> 36:18.756
Fine. Why?

36:22.545 --> 36:24.258
Bubba.

36:25.785 --> 36:27.609
I love you.

36:39.489 --> 36:41.423
- Seen Marie?
- Nuh.

36:41.938 --> 36:44.883
- Hey, how's Liz?
- She's OK. You seen Marie anywhere?

36:44.924 --> 36:46.985
I think she's in the showers.

37:22.409 --> 37:23.963
What the fuck are you doing?

37:29.745 --> 37:31.198
Put it away.

37:36.169 --> 37:38.318
It was either you or her.

37:38.845 --> 37:40.544
Why? What's she got on you?

37:40.555 --> 37:42.042
I don't wanna talk about it.

37:42.899 --> 37:44.815
Whatever it is, you can trust me.

37:44.824 --> 37:46.660
- Well, you say that now.
- I mean it.

37:47.312 --> 37:48.840
Whatever you tell me

37:48.875 --> 37:50.564
won't leave this room.

37:53.944 --> 37:55.404
When I came in here,

37:55.714 --> 37:57.261
it was to do a job.

37:58.048 --> 37:59.796
On Marie Winter.

37:59.921 --> 38:01.174
A job?

38:01.191 --> 38:03.980
She's got a dirt file that
she uses for blackmail,

38:04.149 --> 38:07.178
and she's being protected
by someone very powerful,

38:07.221 --> 38:09.870
high up in either the
force or government.

38:10.526 --> 38:13.077
And we had to investigate discreetly.

38:15.589 --> 38:17.142
You're a cop.

38:20.191 --> 38:21.944
It was my job to find out

38:21.961 --> 38:23.909
who her protector is and expose them.

38:24.115 --> 38:26.305
Shut Marie's operations down.

38:29.542 --> 38:31.958
Oh, shit.

38:32.376 --> 38:34.156
I'm trusting you with my life,

38:34.194 --> 38:35.822
because we're on the same side.

38:35.849 --> 38:37.645
Both against Marie.

38:37.673 --> 38:39.317
Narelle recognised you.

38:39.328 --> 38:41.325
I've got till lunchtime to stop her,

38:41.450 --> 38:43.062
or she'll expose me.

38:43.307 --> 38:44.784
And then I'm dead,

38:45.174 --> 38:47.014
and Ruby will be fucked.

38:47.085 --> 38:48.958
Why don't the cops just get you out?

38:48.980 --> 38:51.329
I fucked up the job when I killed Drago.

38:51.378 --> 38:53.354
Marie destroyed the files,

38:53.392 --> 38:55.432
so I couldn't find out
who was protecting her.

38:55.557 --> 38:57.272
Cops cut me loose.

39:03.996 --> 39:05.934
What if she had copies?

39:06.216 --> 39:08.594
If you had those files,
would the cops get you out?

39:08.615 --> 39:10.820
They'd give me something
to negotiate with,

39:10.835 --> 39:12.729
but they're gone. She destroyed them.

39:13.196 --> 39:15.807
- Leave it with me.
- Where are you goin'?

39:16.843 --> 39:19.003
- You got till lunch.
- Tell me what you're planning,

39:19.057 --> 39:21.228
- so I can help you.
- Don't get your hopes up.

39:21.353 --> 39:23.203
Just lay low for a few hours.

39:23.209 --> 39:24.718
I'll be back.

39:29.032 --> 39:30.894
"Heart failure.

39:31.236 --> 39:34.531
No suspicious circumstances."
He was a heavy fucker.

39:34.558 --> 39:37.011
- I think I did my back in.
- How can you be so casual?

39:37.027 --> 39:38.726
He was fucked to death.

39:38.851 --> 39:41.168
And nothing to suggest he died here.

39:41.586 --> 39:44.017
Oh, hey, I've got another tip for you

39:44.018 --> 39:46.677
and it's a cert, so
it's on the down low.

39:46.704 --> 39:49.294
- All out till pay day.
- Oh, my bookie can run you a deal.

39:49.316 --> 39:51.650
- He'll get you in the credit.
- Yeah, nuh.

39:51.665 --> 39:54.538
- I don't know.
- Odds are 10-1.

39:54.977 --> 39:56.692
I'm putting $500 in.

39:56.817 --> 39:58.184
You in or what?

39:58.233 --> 39:59.546
- OK.
- Yeah?

39:59.601 --> 40:00.784
I'll match ya.

40:01.316 --> 40:03.156
- Ta.
- No worries.

40:06.207 --> 40:07.705
Oh, g'day, big guy.

40:07.737 --> 40:09.637
- Looking good, mate.
- Fuck off.

40:12.025 --> 40:13.892
Are you lookin' for something?

40:14.424 --> 40:17.148
It's only a matter of time before
I catch you in the act, mate.

40:18.109 --> 40:20.052
You wanna know where I keep my stash?

40:20.101 --> 40:22.473
It's right here. Oh, don't be shy.

40:22.522 --> 40:25.458
- I'm gettin' a hard-on...
- Hey, back the fuck up!

40:25.480 --> 40:27.038
You used to like it.

40:27.233 --> 40:29.431
- You still shaving that bad boy?
- Get out of it!

40:29.556 --> 40:31.412
- What, you gone all straight now?
- Yeah.

40:31.450 --> 40:33.426
Yeah? How long this time?

40:33.763 --> 40:36.981
Honestly, how do you keep it up?

40:38.295 --> 40:40.677
Vera's having my baby, OK?

40:40.704 --> 40:42.403
So get fucked.

40:43.038 --> 40:44.825
Bullshit.

41:37.684 --> 41:39.855
What the fuck are you doing?

41:41.381 --> 41:44.105
No wonder you were hiding this shit.

41:45.945 --> 41:49.895
You! Get... No!

41:51.272 --> 41:53.355
I'll fuckin' kill you.

41:53.480 --> 41:55.288
I've seen the email account.

41:55.322 --> 41:58.952
I know where you store it all,
and I know who's protecting you!

42:07.548 --> 42:10.268
You and your protector are fucked.

42:10.906 --> 42:12.785
Get out of my cell!

42:12.799 --> 42:15.513
By the way, I'm telling Allie
that you're fucking the governor.

42:16.137 --> 42:18.209
- Don't!
- I gave you a chance.

42:18.225 --> 42:19.560
- Kaz, please...
- No, I don't want to hear

42:19.577 --> 42:21.444
your fucking bullshit excuses
'cause now I have to be the bad guy.

42:21.453 --> 42:23.654
But that's OK, 'cause then she'll know,

42:23.779 --> 42:26.037
and she can make her own choice.

42:39.193 --> 42:42.450
Proctor, you're late.
We've got a session.

42:43.671 --> 42:46.260
Sorry. I, um, just need to see someone.

42:46.287 --> 42:48.251
Your sessions are compulsory, remember.

42:48.267 --> 42:50.542
You've got all morning to
chat to your mates. Come on.

43:01.733 --> 43:04.382
What do I have to do
to keep my sister safe?

43:12.294 --> 43:14.145
You seem different today.

43:19.132 --> 43:21.645
Have you seen Marie Winter
since she got out of Medical?

43:21.770 --> 43:22.921
Yeah.

43:22.937 --> 43:24.745
- How was that?
- Fine.

43:25.608 --> 43:27.437
I expect there's a
lot of animosity there.

43:27.443 --> 43:29.403
How do you think you'll
cope with that day-to-day?

43:29.521 --> 43:31.464
Last few days have been tough.

43:32.957 --> 43:34.558
But things are looking up.

43:35.914 --> 43:38.010
It's good to see you thinking positive.

43:40.088 --> 43:42.721
Do you think the two of you
will ever be able to get along?

43:42.770 --> 43:44.284
No.

43:46.086 --> 43:49.326
Marie thrives on
manipulation, power, sex.

43:49.451 --> 43:52.306
She's selfish. Doesn't give
a shit about anybody else.

43:53.836 --> 43:55.899
I guess that's why we hate each other.

43:57.218 --> 43:58.716
We're opposites.

43:59.015 --> 44:00.752
And you think you're selfless?

44:00.828 --> 44:02.374
I'm no angel, I know that.

44:02.499 --> 44:04.460
But I'm a better person than her.

44:04.909 --> 44:06.489
I'm stronger, too.

44:07.195 --> 44:10.197
Do you see strength as
your defining quality?

44:11.575 --> 44:13.410
Is that why you're Top Dog?

44:13.627 --> 44:14.821
Probably.

44:15.999 --> 44:18.024
When I was a kid, I was the victim.

44:18.349 --> 44:19.929
I was Karen.

44:20.689 --> 44:23.691
But I refused to let that be my story.

44:26.031 --> 44:28.793
Ever since, I've been fighting.

44:30.612 --> 44:34.324
All I ever wanted to do
was protect the vulnerable.

44:36.495 --> 44:40.484
But now I can see a
new way forward. Not...

44:40.864 --> 44:42.740
controlling the women...

44:43.247 --> 44:47.773
but supporting them, encouraging
them to make their own choices.

44:51.062 --> 44:54.438
I feel respected, appreciated

44:55.116 --> 44:56.679
and loved.

46:15.977 --> 46:18.658
You know, I am proud of my achievements

46:18.680 --> 46:21.306
and I'm proud of the
woman that I've become.

46:29.370 --> 46:31.855
And I'm hopeful for the future.

Kaz saved my life.

46:59.915 --> 47:01.332
We counted on her,

47:01.457 --> 47:03.421
not just as a Top Dog,

47:03.449 --> 47:05.512
she was our friend.

47:06.146 --> 47:08.214
Did you kill Kaz Proctor?

47:08.437 --> 47:10.217
I would never hurt Kaz.

47:10.255 --> 47:12.128
Whoever did it should pay.

47:12.160 --> 47:14.092
Cops have got CCTV of the killer.

47:14.114 --> 47:15.576
She was blackmailing me,

47:15.592 --> 47:17.871
she must have had
someone else on the side.
