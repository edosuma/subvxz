(male announcer)
Next is a Bravo
scripted original series.

00:04.067 --> 00:06.133
(Hazel) Hi, Aunt Vanessa.
(Vanessa) Hi, guys.

00:06.133 --> 00:07.633
(Jill)
We're going to Brooklyn.

00:07.633 --> 00:08.867
(train conductor)
There's a Brooklyn-bound
fifth train.

00:08.867 --> 00:11.967
Transfers available
for the four train.

00:11.967 --> 00:13.200
(Jill)
Are we there yet?

00:13.200 --> 00:14.900
(Vanessa)
Calm down, we're almost there.

00:14.900 --> 00:16.433
(train conductor)
This train is no longer
in service.

00:16.433 --> 00:17.467
[muffled announcement]

00:17.467 --> 00:18.467
(Jill)
What the hell is he saying?

00:18.467 --> 00:19.500
(train conductor)
Thank you.

00:19.500 --> 00:20.500
(Hazel)
Just a few more stops, mom.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.300
(Jill) [groans]
[alert tones]

00:22.300 --> 00:24.233
(train conductor)
Next stop, Grand Army Plaza.

00:24.233 --> 00:26.033
Stand clear
of the closing doors please.

00:26.033 --> 00:28.333
(Jill)
Finally!

00:28.333 --> 00:31.467
I think I just went through
menopause on that subway ride.

00:31.467 --> 00:34.667
I hate schlepping
to Brooklyn.

00:34.667 --> 00:36.133
Whoa!

00:36.133 --> 00:38.167
I'm sorry.
I this the Champs-ElysÃ©es?

00:38.167 --> 00:39.567
Not too shabby.

00:39.567 --> 00:42.033
Explains why everyone's so smug
about living here.

00:42.033 --> 00:44.133
1This way.

00:44.133 --> 00:46.267
I still can't believe
Krista moved to Brooklyn.

00:46.267 --> 00:48.667
I can't believe
Krista's still alive.

00:48.667 --> 00:50.300
Remember that night
at the Soho house

00:50.300 --> 00:52.500
when she showed up
in that feathery bikini thing,

00:52.500 --> 00:54.133
begging us to do E
with her?

00:54.133 --> 00:55.800
Mommy, what's E?

00:55.800 --> 00:58.600
Oh, my God,
look at that huge dog.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.900
Thanks a lot.

01:00.900 --> 01:02.400
Hey, Hazel.

01:02.400 --> 01:04.633
That's what real pregnant
bellies look like.

01:04.633 --> 01:06.367
They actually pop out.

01:06.367 --> 01:08.733
Ugh, it's like
preggo-palooza here.

01:08.733 --> 01:09.933
There better be
some single people

01:09.933 --> 01:11.567
at this housewarming
or we're ditching.

01:11.567 --> 01:13.933
Fine, done.
Krista can't last

01:13.933 --> 01:16.267
more than two hours at a party
without passing out anyway.

01:16.267 --> 01:19.067
Why does Krista
always pass out?

01:19.067 --> 01:21.300
Oh, look,
another huge dog.

01:21.300 --> 01:23.133
[punk rock music]

01:23.133 --> 01:25.733
* Hey, yes, you know *

01:25.733 --> 01:28.733
* I'm feeling fine,
I'm feeling fine *

01:43.433 --> 01:48.333
Holy frackin' Shiite.
Is that a tree house?

01:48.333 --> 01:49.967
This place is incredible.

01:49.967 --> 01:51.833
They have a trampoline!

01:51.833 --> 01:53.833
Have fun.

01:53.833 --> 01:56.700
Look at this crowd.
They're so chill.

01:56.700 --> 01:59.133
I don't see any
white cigarette leg jeans,

01:59.133 --> 02:02.233
not a lick of mascara,
no silicone.

02:02.233 --> 02:04.867
In fact, I have the perkiest
boobs at this party.

02:04.867 --> 02:08.433
(Vanessa)
All I see are breeders,
and yuck, do we all need

02:08.433 --> 02:10.767
a front row seat
to the pepperoni nipple show?

02:10.767 --> 02:12.800
Guys, you made it!

02:12.800 --> 02:15.733
Krista, I'm having
a total real estate boner.

02:15.733 --> 02:18.733
[laughs]
Come down.

02:23.100 --> 02:24.933
(Vanessa)
Krista, you look amazing.

02:24.933 --> 02:26.067
Thank you.

02:26.067 --> 02:27.633
Your boyfriend's
such a sweetheart.

02:27.633 --> 02:28.700
How'd you guys meet?

02:28.700 --> 02:32.100
N.A.
Narcotics Anonymous.

02:32.100 --> 02:33.600
- Oh, no way.
- Seriously?

02:33.600 --> 02:35.067
Good for you.

02:35.067 --> 02:36.900
If you don't mind my asking,
did you hit, like,

02:36.900 --> 02:38.367
a rock bottom moment?

02:38.367 --> 02:40.767
Did you wake up in a dumpster
in Philadelphia or something?

02:40.767 --> 02:43.267
Actually, you.

02:44.400 --> 02:45.633
You were my rock bottom.

02:45.633 --> 02:46.967
- Me?
- Her?

02:46.967 --> 02:48.433
Yeah.
4:00 in the afternoon,

02:48.433 --> 02:50.833
I'd just given head
to the bus boy at Bar Polo

02:50.833 --> 02:52.167
in exchange for a bump,

02:52.167 --> 02:53.933
and I walked out
onto third avenue,

02:53.933 --> 02:56.267
and I'm wiping coke and jizz
off my face,

02:56.267 --> 02:58.467
and I see you
across the street,

02:58.467 --> 03:00.667
pregnant,
and pushing a stroller.

03:00.667 --> 03:05.067
And I say to myself,
"Self, how did this happen?"

03:05.067 --> 03:06.633
And then, I thought
a thousand things real fast

03:06.633 --> 03:08.500
'cause of the coke,
you know, but that--

03:08.500 --> 03:11.067
that was my first step
to recovery.

03:11.067 --> 03:12.933
Um--

03:12.933 --> 03:15.200
Don't worry about it.
It's a process.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.933
My bread!
Oh, thank you, honey.

03:17.933 --> 03:19.100
I was her rock bottom.

03:19.100 --> 03:20.733
I heard.

03:20.733 --> 03:22.067
Oh, bread.

03:22.067 --> 03:24.067
I got to get a picture
of Grenoui with the bread.

03:24.067 --> 03:26.100
What is with the frog?

03:26.100 --> 03:28.667
This is Grenoui.
It's Hazel's class frog,

03:28.667 --> 03:31.167
and each kid takes it home
for the weekend

03:31.167 --> 03:33.900
and records his adventures
in a big class journal.

03:33.900 --> 03:36.767
According to Hazel, he's been
to The Great Wall of China,

03:36.767 --> 03:38.900
a bunch of the Spielbergs,
and Camp David.

03:38.900 --> 03:40.300
- [chuckles]
- True, but...

03:40.300 --> 03:42.600
he's never had bread before,
so we're popping

03:42.600 --> 03:44.500
his gluten cherry
in Brookles.

03:44.500 --> 03:47.167
Oh, now--Adrian.
Adrian, come here. Come here.

03:47.167 --> 03:49.800
I want you to meet my college
friends Jill and Vanessa.

03:49.800 --> 03:52.900
Oh, so cute!
Congratulations.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.167
Oh, so tiny.

03:55.167 --> 03:58.133
Ooh, I better get this.
Might be the hospital.

03:58.133 --> 03:59.567
What an angel.

03:59.567 --> 04:02.100
Actually,
this was my toughest birth.

04:02.100 --> 04:03.867
After 40 hours of labor,

04:03.867 --> 04:06.700
I was still only
1 centimeter dilated.

04:06.700 --> 04:09.600
Finally, my midwife
decided it was time to-

04:09.600 --> 04:11.500
Caesar salad that crouton
right out of there?

04:11.500 --> 04:14.067
Yeah.
I felt like such a failure.

04:14.067 --> 04:17.100
I mean, I hadn't even read
the chapter on...

04:17.100 --> 04:18.800
[whispering]
C-sections,

04:18.800 --> 04:22.800
'cause I never dreamed
I would be one of those people.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.200
[laughs]

04:24.200 --> 04:25.467
What?

04:25.467 --> 04:28.433
It's just I come
from a very different planet.

04:28.433 --> 04:30.067
[dance music playing]

04:30.067 --> 04:33.633
[whistling]

04:33.633 --> 04:35.800
[breathing deeply]

04:35.800 --> 04:37.733
Look at you.

04:37.733 --> 04:40.200
One day before baby
numero quatro,

04:40.200 --> 04:42.067
and you are still
rocking those abs.

04:42.067 --> 04:45.733
If you get your core toned
enough before a C-section,

04:45.733 --> 04:48.967
the surgeon can just slice
through it like a sushi chef.

04:48.967 --> 04:51.200
- It really reduces scarring.
- Oh.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.867
Okay, back
to the punch list.

04:52.867 --> 04:54.533
We have a lot to get done
before tomorrow.

04:54.533 --> 04:55.800
I'm all over it.
I just checked in

04:55.800 --> 04:57.967
with the photographer,
social media manager,

04:57.967 --> 05:00.733
wardrobe designer,
and eastern medicine consultant.

05:00.733 --> 05:02.567
Everyone's up to speed.

05:03.900 --> 05:06.833
Brookie, what is it?

05:06.833 --> 05:09.500
You look so sad.

05:09.500 --> 05:13.367
I'm just...so fat,

05:13.367 --> 05:17.300
and I guess I'm just
feeling sentimental,

05:17.300 --> 05:19.800
thinking
about little Rutherford.

05:19.800 --> 05:21.333
He's not gonna be
the baby anymore.

05:21.333 --> 05:23.700
Aww, that is so sweet.

05:23.700 --> 05:26.067
You want to spend some alone
time with the little guy today?

05:26.067 --> 05:27.467
No, God no.

05:27.467 --> 05:30.333
No, I think I just want to do
something special for him.

05:30.333 --> 05:33.600
I need to feel connected.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.733
In fact--
[groans]

05:36.733 --> 05:38.900
Crystal, angel?

05:38.900 --> 05:41.233
Meet me in the kitchen.

05:41.233 --> 05:44.300
[rock music playing]

05:44.300 --> 05:45.867
[overlapping chatter]

05:45.867 --> 05:47.867
[French horn blowing]

05:51.900 --> 05:56.133
Mm, not that guy.
He looks dead inside.

05:56.133 --> 05:59.167
How do you know
that's not my type?

05:59.167 --> 06:03.433
I'd say I don't usually
do this, but that'd be a lie.

06:03.433 --> 06:05.433
Oh, I get it.
I mean, why come to a party

06:05.433 --> 06:06.900
where you could actually
talk to people

06:06.900 --> 06:09.300
when you can just scroll through
'em on your tiny computer?

06:09.300 --> 06:11.733
Hey, do not knock
my tiny computer.

06:11.733 --> 06:14.167
It's so pretty and smart.

06:14.167 --> 06:17.133
Yeah, it's smart 'cause it's
stealing all your brain cells.

06:17.133 --> 06:19.900
I just read this piece
on HuffPo

06:19.900 --> 06:21.633
about how if you
take a break, even for a day,

06:21.633 --> 06:23.867
from your phone, it can add
years to your life.

06:23.867 --> 06:27.833
I'm guessing you read that
on your phone?

06:27.833 --> 06:30.400
Yes, I did.

06:30.400 --> 06:31.933
I'm Elliot by the way.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.367
Vanessa, by the way.

06:39.700 --> 06:43.233
College educated,
totally stumped.

06:43.233 --> 06:46.467
I'm going with hard plastic.

06:46.467 --> 06:49.267
So Krista tells me
you're that one's mom?

06:49.267 --> 06:52.400
Depends. Was she dancing
like a stripper again?

06:52.400 --> 06:53.733
Because I swear, she's just

06:53.733 --> 06:55.333
trying to pay her way
through grade school.

06:55.333 --> 06:57.067
Actually, we just had

06:57.067 --> 06:59.067
the most fascinating
conversation about Icarus.

06:59.067 --> 07:00.833
And I see a lot
of kids in my work,

07:00.833 --> 07:02.967
and she is a very
sophisticated thinker.

07:02.967 --> 07:05.167
Wow, that's so nice to hear.

07:05.167 --> 07:07.067
- Where do you work?
- St. Anne's, in Admissions.

07:07.067 --> 07:08.933
Yeah, I know I'm biased,

07:08.933 --> 07:11.233
but it's such
an unusual school.

07:11.233 --> 07:12.933
For one thing,
we don't give grades.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.800
No grades, ever, at all?

07:15.800 --> 07:17.733
Well, how do you know you're
doing better than everyone else?

07:17.733 --> 07:19.333
Exactly.

07:19.333 --> 07:21.967
We think the world needs more
questioners, not followers.

07:21.967 --> 07:24.933
I totally agree.
Can I go there?

07:24.933 --> 07:27.367
Off the record, we just
heard that one of our families

07:27.367 --> 07:28.733
is relocating to London

07:28.733 --> 07:30.267
to star in the spinoff
of Downton Abbey,

07:30.267 --> 07:31.967
so there might
be openings.

07:31.967 --> 07:34.333
I think Hazel
would be a great fit.

07:34.333 --> 07:35.867
So let me know
if you're interested.

07:37.200 --> 07:40.200
[peaceful string music
playing]

07:40.200 --> 07:48.167
* *

07:51.633 --> 07:55.633
Yes, I'm interested.

07:57.067 --> 07:59.367
[upbeat vocals playing]

07:59.367 --> 08:02.367
Andy, honey, hi.
Here's the deal.

08:02.367 --> 08:04.533
I think we belong in Brooklyn.

08:04.533 --> 08:06.633
I just met this Admissions woman
from St. Anne's.

08:06.633 --> 08:08.067
She's, like,
in love with Hazel,

08:08.067 --> 08:10.733
and Krista lives in a palace

08:10.733 --> 08:13.133
for half of the cost of
what we could get in our name.

08:13.133 --> 08:14.867
I really think we belong here.

08:14.867 --> 08:16.833
I mean, there are people
with frizzy hair

08:16.833 --> 08:18.700
and hideous sandals
with arched support.

08:18.700 --> 08:20.100
I'm excited.
Call me.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.867
- Love ya.
- Jill.

08:21.867 --> 08:23.100
Hey. There you are.

08:23.100 --> 08:24.600
Guys, this is Vanessa.

08:24.600 --> 08:27.700
Vanessa, these are
actual cool moms.

08:27.700 --> 08:29.600
I found them.
They're all in Brooklyn.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.067
Hi, cool moms.

08:31.067 --> 08:33.233
Nice to meet you.
I'm the cool single friend.

08:33.233 --> 08:35.633
I'm actually gonna take off
for a while.

08:35.633 --> 08:37.867
Really? The kids are about
to play their glockenspiels.

08:37.867 --> 08:39.533
Oh, thanks for the warning.

08:39.533 --> 08:43.067
I met this possibly cute guy,
one o'clock,

08:43.067 --> 08:44.400
talking to pepperoni nips.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.500
He's a real estate agent.

08:45.500 --> 08:46.833
He found this house for Krista.

08:46.833 --> 08:49.067
Great. Can you have
him find me one just like it?

08:49.067 --> 08:51.533
Oh!
I love Brooklyn Jill.

08:51.533 --> 08:54.333
So he convinced me to try
this kinky retro

08:54.333 --> 08:56.100
phone-free experiment.

08:56.100 --> 08:58.700
Can I trust you to babysit
these until we get back?

08:58.700 --> 09:01.167
Well, what if I have to text
you an emergency opinion?

09:01.167 --> 09:03.833
Oh, babe,
just whisper it to the wind,

09:03.833 --> 09:06.933
and if it's truly juicy
and bitchy, I'll hear it.

09:15.333 --> 09:17.400
You bake?

09:17.400 --> 09:20.067
How could I not know
this about you?

09:20.067 --> 09:22.600
You know I don't like
to talk about myself.

09:22.600 --> 09:25.967
This is Rutherford's favorite,
coconut cream pie.

09:25.967 --> 09:27.933
The recipe's a snap.
I'll send you the link.

09:27.933 --> 09:30.467

09:35.533 --> 09:37.867
See? That's all you do.

09:37.867 --> 09:41.367
Aww, do you remember
when I brought Rutherford home

09:41.367 --> 09:42.700
from the hospital?

09:42.700 --> 09:45.067
He was in that
precious Bumpier onesie.

09:45.067 --> 09:46.633
Of course.
How could I forget?

09:46.633 --> 09:49.867
Oh, my God.

09:49.867 --> 09:52.200
I haven't picked out
the baby's coming home outfit.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.333
I have no idea
who she's wearing.

09:54.333 --> 09:55.967
Okay, calme, calme.

09:55.967 --> 09:57.867
Don't tell me to "calmay."

09:57.867 --> 09:59.800
Call my entire staff.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.333
How could it fall
through the cracks?

10:01.333 --> 10:04.800
Ugh!

10:04.800 --> 10:06.067
Oh, and save me a slice.

10:10.333 --> 10:12.333
[approaching footsteps]

10:15.167 --> 10:16.833
Wow.

10:16.833 --> 10:18.067
I was just alone
with my thoughts

10:18.067 --> 10:20.767
for the first time
in years.

10:20.767 --> 10:22.400
I think I resolved
a few childhood traumas.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.500
Yup, can't remember
the last time

10:24.500 --> 10:26.000
I peed
without checking email.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.800
Ah. Sorry, it's
just been a while

10:28.800 --> 10:31.033
since I swiped anything.

10:31.033 --> 10:33.100
[chuckling]

10:33.100 --> 10:35.167
Martians could've landed
at Trader Joe's,

10:35.167 --> 10:37.333
and you'd have no way
of knowing.

10:37.333 --> 10:38.700
Well, here's
to not knowing.

10:38.700 --> 10:41.200
To not knowing.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.367
What are you talking about?

10:43.367 --> 10:46.300
When people write "XO,"
the X is the kiss,

10:46.300 --> 10:48.033
and the O is the hug.
Everyone knows this.

10:48.033 --> 10:49.667
No, it isn't.

10:49.667 --> 10:52.233
The X is the hug because you
cross your arms like this,

10:52.233 --> 10:54.633
and the O is the kiss because
you pucker your lips like this.

10:54.633 --> 10:56.800
That would mean
"XOXO" translates

10:56.800 --> 10:59.167
into "Hug, kiss, hug, kiss."
Who says that?

10:59.167 --> 11:01.533
Everyone. Everyone says that.
"Hugs and kisses."

11:01.533 --> 11:03.533
It's built into the basic
fabric of our lexicon.

11:03.533 --> 11:07.067
You are so comically,
embarrassingly wrong.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.067
I feel bad for you in advance

11:09.067 --> 11:10.767
when your wrongness
is confirmed.

11:10.767 --> 11:12.200
Well, for now, we're just
gonna have to sit,

11:12.200 --> 11:13.867
and be cool
with not knowing.

11:13.867 --> 11:16.267
Fine, whatever.
I can do that.

11:16.267 --> 11:18.367
So can I.

11:22.067 --> 11:23.167
- Check!
- Check.

11:23.167 --> 11:24.367
- Now.
- Get the check, please.

11:24.367 --> 11:25.600
Thank you.

Sorry. I'm a total idiot.

It's on your left.
Grab a handful.

11:31.867 --> 11:33.633
Thank you.

11:33.633 --> 11:36.067
So is it safe to say
you love living here?

11:36.067 --> 11:37.867
Oh, my God.

11:37.867 --> 11:39.400
Are you serious
about moving to Brooklyn?

11:39.400 --> 11:42.233
Oh, I have never
been happier.

11:42.233 --> 11:44.867
We love Allegra's
charter school.

11:44.867 --> 11:46.667
Oh, they have this whole
new approach to math that merges

11:46.667 --> 11:49.067
the scientific method
with the Socratic one,

11:49.067 --> 11:51.267
and then, it combines
the Talmud, dice,

11:51.267 --> 11:52.467
and hip-hop lyrics.

11:52.467 --> 11:54.233
Hmm, I still
count on my fingers.

11:54.233 --> 11:56.067
There's also
music and letters,

11:56.067 --> 11:57.567
where the kids
write their own memoires

11:57.567 --> 11:59.900
and can choose between
majoring in symphony,

11:59.900 --> 12:02.100
eastern music,
or rock band.

12:02.100 --> 12:03.300
Rock band, please.

12:03.300 --> 12:04.600
There's also Brooklyn
Perspectives, which has

12:04.600 --> 12:07.667
an organic rooftop farm
and a cheese making program.

12:07.667 --> 12:09.433
- There's so many options.
- Oh, yes.

12:09.433 --> 12:11.100
This is how it happens.

12:11.100 --> 12:12.800
You are so moving here.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.600
Hey, isn't there
an open house on Bergen?

12:14.600 --> 12:17.400
Oh, Jill.
Three stories, rooftop, deck.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.067
It's gonna go
in a heartbeat.

12:19.067 --> 12:20.833
I don't know. I mean,
it's one thing to fantasize,

12:20.833 --> 12:22.600
but I haven't even
talked to Andy about it.

12:22.600 --> 12:23.967
Just go. Have a look.

12:23.967 --> 12:25.233
It can't hurt.

13:13.367 --> 13:16.833
Well, kind of not supposed to

a little smarty-pants.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.067
What'd I do now?

13:30.067 --> 13:31.333
It's just that
you're really not

13:31.333 --> 13:33.733
supposed to tell them
they're smart.

13:33.733 --> 13:36.600
Didn't you read that cover
article in the Atlantic Monthly?

13:36.600 --> 13:37.900
I must've missed it.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.267
You're supposed to
emphasize effort.

You know, "Oh, you worked
so hard on that."

What happened with that?

remember?

14:52.667 --> 14:55.267
Well, then
I was out of my mind

dead in those colors,

18:47.200 --> 18:50.433
Hazel, put down the bongos.
Grab the frog.

18:50.433 --> 18:53.700
We're getting the F
out of here now.

(Jill)
Taxi, take us
to the Upper East Side.

19:13.367 --> 19:17.067
Gah! Ugh!
I just drank placenta.

19:18.567 --> 19:20.100
Thank you.

19:20.100 --> 19:21.967
Thank you, God,
for returning us

19:21.967 --> 19:24.167
to this
wonderful neighborhood.

19:24.167 --> 19:27.333
We're home!

19:27.333 --> 19:28.767
* Every morning *

19:28.767 --> 19:30.867
* Every evening *

19:30.867 --> 19:33.900
* Ain't we got fun *

19:33.900 --> 19:37.867
* Not much money,
oh, but, honey *

19:37.867 --> 19:41.367
* Ain't we got fun *

19:41.367 --> 19:45.067
* The rent's unpaid, dear *

19:45.067 --> 19:48.267
* We haven't a buck *

19:48.267 --> 19:52.067
* But smiles
were made, dear *

19:52.067 --> 19:56.067
* For people like us *

19:56.067 --> 20:02.033

20:02.033 --> 20:04.233
* In the winter,
in the summer... *

20:04.233 --> 20:07.467
I hate being pregnant.

20:07.467 --> 20:08.700
Ow.

20:08.700 --> 20:10.900
[laughs]

20:10.900 --> 20:12.367
I haven't seen her in years..

20:12.367 --> 20:14.400
I mean, what's wrong
with placenta?

20:14.400 --> 20:16.500
* Still we have fun *

20:16.500 --> 20:19.133
* There's nothing surer *

20:19.133 --> 20:22.967
* The rich get rich
and the poor get poorer *

20:26.133 --> 20:27.433
Oh, shÃ¡Ã¡.

20:36.233 --> 20:38.667
Hazel, honey,
we might be different

20:38.667 --> 20:40.533
from some of
the uptight people here,

20:40.533 --> 20:42.167
but this is our home.

20:42.167 --> 20:44.400
Our family is here.
And you know what?

20:44.400 --> 20:48.300
We might not tell them as often
as we should that we love them.

20:48.300 --> 20:50.533
[cell phone rings]

20:50.533 --> 20:52.400
- What?
- It's Jill.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.067
I just wanted to say
good luck tomorrow.

20:54.067 --> 20:55.933
We can't wait
to meet our little-

20:55.933 --> 20:58.133
I can't talk right now.

20:58.133 --> 20:59.867
You sound weird.
Are you okay?

20:59.867 --> 21:01.667
No!

21:01.667 --> 21:05.467
There is a tumor with hair
coming out of my assÃ¡Ã¡Ã¡Ã¡.

21:05.467 --> 21:08.733
- What is happening?
- That's called "labor."

21:08.733 --> 21:10.967
You're having this baby
the natural way.

21:10.967 --> 21:18.967
Nooooo!
