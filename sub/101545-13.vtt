00:01.501 --> 00:02.377
Mistress:
Previously on "The Outpost"...

00:02.419 --> 00:03.211
There's a black kinj.
Maybe the only weapon
that'll kill Yavalla.

00:03.211 --> 00:06.923
- And where is it?
- There's someone in
the Plane of Ashes

00:06.965 --> 00:08.425
- who might know where it is.
- Who?

00:08.466 --> 00:11.594
- My father.
- We need your help. Now.

00:11.636 --> 00:14.597
Bring the Outpost
into my fold.

00:14.639 --> 00:19.060
- They're all infected!
- Get that barricade up!

00:19.102 --> 00:21.062
- Has anyone seen Falista?
- Hello there.

00:23.106 --> 00:24.899
- You came for me.
- Stay close to the wall.

00:24.941 --> 00:27.068
I'll come right
behind you, okay? Go.

00:27.110 --> 00:31.573
Use your power
to protect the Queen.

00:31.614 --> 00:34.159
- This is the place.
- Talon, I think
that's your father.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.453
- That's him.
- Don't touch me!

00:46.337 --> 00:49.966
This has gone on long enough.

00:50.008 --> 00:52.385
You live like an animal,

00:52.427 --> 00:55.472
hiding in the darkness
eating the gods know what.

00:55.513 --> 00:59.100
I have done everything I can
to reason with you.

00:59.142 --> 01:01.603
Saivek:
There's nothing but death
for you down here, Yavalla.

01:01.644 --> 01:03.855
You shouldn't have come.

01:05.732 --> 01:08.651
I have waited an eternity
for you to come around.

01:08.693 --> 01:10.445
I shall wait no more.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.947
It is time
to unlock the power

01:12.989 --> 01:15.658
you have kept from me
all these years.

01:15.700 --> 01:18.369
Saivek:
You can either leave right now

01:18.411 --> 01:20.080
or I'll add your bones
to the pile.

01:20.121 --> 01:22.582
but I'm not giving you
the box.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.835
Give me more light.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.899
Fools, don't let him touch you!

02:02.455 --> 02:04.082
Move.

02:06.459 --> 02:08.336
( groans )

02:13.216 --> 02:16.344
- The box.
- Never.

02:28.940 --> 02:31.693
Saivek, the box.

02:33.444 --> 02:35.155
Priestess?

02:38.158 --> 02:40.076
- Open it.
- Don't!

02:57.260 --> 02:59.095
Oh.

03:03.600 --> 03:08.146
- Oh. Well done, Corven.
- Yes, Priestess.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.107
It's a curse, Yavalla.

03:11.149 --> 03:14.652
It will end with death
for everything.

03:16.487 --> 03:21.201
- Even you.
- When the portal reopens,

03:21.242 --> 03:24.078
we will take back
what we lost.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.622
Time to go.

03:27.874 --> 03:30.168
Don't leave me, Priestess!

03:31.127 --> 03:32.337
You won't survive.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.088
But I served you faithfully.

03:34.130 --> 03:37.008
Yes, you did,
and I thank you.

03:37.050 --> 03:40.595
I hope you don't suffer
too much.

03:41.554 --> 03:42.680
Come.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.809
Hey. Set me free.

03:49.312 --> 03:52.523
Set me free!
I have to stop her!

03:52.565 --> 03:53.900
No!

03:56.945 --> 03:58.321
No.

03:59.822 --> 04:01.574
No!

04:01.616 --> 04:04.744
( theme music playing )

04:10.041 --> 04:13.169
I told you! It's death.

04:13.211 --> 04:17.632
He's right. I am death.

04:17.674 --> 04:20.176
How are you still alive?
No one could survive that.

04:20.218 --> 04:22.679
Because I'm cursed,
that's how.

04:22.720 --> 04:25.598
You have the black kinj.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.226
How do you know about that?

04:29.852 --> 04:32.939
Who are you people?
Did Yavalla send you?

04:34.232 --> 04:37.902
Don't touch me!

04:37.944 --> 04:39.028
I don't need to touch you,

04:39.070 --> 04:41.364
but I'm not leaving you
like this.

04:41.406 --> 04:44.534
Look at how many he's killed.
They were my friends.

04:44.575 --> 04:46.452
- He'll kill you next.
- If he wanted to kill me,

04:46.494 --> 04:48.121
he wouldn't have stopped me
from touching him.

04:48.162 --> 04:51.416
He'll kill me!
Don't do it.

05:16.399 --> 05:20.278
You're the one
that did this to me.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.823
We're not with Yavalla.
We're from the green world.

05:23.865 --> 05:26.284
Yavalla has already conquered
most of the other world.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.411
We need the black kinj
to stop her.

05:28.453 --> 05:32.332
Well, how did she get there?
How did you come here?

05:32.373 --> 05:34.292
My wife would never
have opened the portal.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.336
Your wife died a few years
after you abandoned her.

05:36.377 --> 05:38.880
How do you know about that?

05:40.882 --> 05:43.176
She passed the Asterkinj
to her daughter.

05:44.802 --> 05:48.097
My daughter? Talon.

05:48.139 --> 05:50.641
Is she still alive?

05:53.603 --> 05:56.356
Oh, thank the gods.

05:59.192 --> 06:02.111
How-- how do you know
all this?

06:03.446 --> 06:04.864
Do you know her? Do you--

06:08.284 --> 06:09.369
Do you know Talon?

06:11.829 --> 06:12.872
I am Talon.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.296
( sputters )

06:36.562 --> 06:38.022
He should never have
come after me.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.732
He had to.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.360
He loves you.

06:44.737 --> 06:47.657
He loved you.

06:47.698 --> 06:50.201
Even with his dying breath,
he was thinking of you.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.995
- What do you mean?
- His last words were,

06:53.037 --> 06:55.331
"Use your power
to protect the Queen."

06:57.667 --> 07:00.128
Falista, he died
saving your life.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.632
I believe when he said
"protect the Queen,"

07:04.674 --> 07:07.885
he meant protect
what I represent,
protect the Realm.

07:07.927 --> 07:12.014
Listen to me, he loved you.

07:13.349 --> 07:14.559
It was the last thing
he said to me

07:14.600 --> 07:16.185
before he went to save you.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.440
I'm so sorry.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.944
I'm being so selfish.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.863
You lost someone
you loved as well.

07:32.160 --> 07:36.330
That thing in my head
managed to kill the person
that attacked Tobin,

07:36.372 --> 07:39.625
but it nearly
killed him as well.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.627
I can't control it.

07:43.254 --> 07:44.881
I'm afraid
I'll be no help to you.

08:12.700 --> 08:15.369
This violence is futile!

08:15.411 --> 08:18.456
Enough suffering
has been caused.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.417
Enough lives have been lost.

08:23.794 --> 08:27.089
You have been told
that we are possessed

08:27.131 --> 08:29.467
and we can't think
for ourselves.

08:29.509 --> 08:32.011
These are all lies.

08:32.053 --> 08:36.390
The Queen lies to you
so she can rule over you.

08:36.432 --> 08:40.978
She would rather see you dead
than make peace with Yavalla.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.148
I know there are some of you
who are ready to join us.

08:44.190 --> 08:47.527
- Don't be afraid.
- Not Munt.

08:47.568 --> 08:48.694
How could you even
consider that?

08:48.736 --> 08:52.490
Join us and live.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.367
You don't have to die today.

08:54.408 --> 08:57.119
No, don't listen to him.
Don't listen to him!

08:57.161 --> 09:00.206
You all know Munt,
and that is not him.

09:00.248 --> 09:01.999
It's Yavalla trying
to trick us.

09:02.041 --> 09:07.421
Janzo. My brother.

09:07.463 --> 09:10.633
Tear down this barricade
and join me

09:10.675 --> 09:14.428
in the warm embrace
of Yavalla's mercy

09:14.470 --> 09:17.640
or you will die cold and alone.

09:20.726 --> 09:22.853
( music playing )

09:26.023 --> 09:27.733
There's so many of them.

09:31.445 --> 09:33.906
60,000 give or take.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.158
I've seen enough.

09:49.255 --> 09:52.883
Is this all that remains
of the little world
I've conquered?

09:52.925 --> 09:54.719
Almost a disappointment.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.096
Look at all this death.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.306
Unlike your Queen,

09:58.347 --> 10:00.391
I did not wish to hurt anyone.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.102
And to Queen Rosmund,
I say only this,

10:03.144 --> 10:05.896
how many more lives
will you sacrifice?

10:05.938 --> 10:09.317
Do you really care
so little for your subjects?

10:09.358 --> 10:13.112
And your friends,
will you sentence them to death

10:13.154 --> 10:17.033
or will you give them
the freedom to choose
for themselves?

10:17.074 --> 10:19.327
You dare speak to me
of freedom?

10:19.368 --> 10:21.037
You who enslaves
the minds of your people?

10:21.078 --> 10:23.914
Has one of your followers
chosen to join you,

10:23.956 --> 10:25.916
or have you forced each
and every one of them?

10:25.958 --> 10:27.460
My people are happy.

10:27.501 --> 10:30.713
Much happier than yours,
I assure you.

10:30.755 --> 10:34.175
And do they know how short
their lives will be?

10:34.216 --> 10:35.718
Dying in weeks
because of your disease?

10:35.760 --> 10:39.680
Not dying.
Becoming part of me.

10:39.722 --> 10:43.726
We're spent enough time talking.
Go ahead and attack.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.936
We'll see how many of your
followers are dead

10:45.978 --> 10:47.647
by the time the sun goes down.

10:47.688 --> 10:49.940
I know how much you love
to lose your followers

10:49.982 --> 10:52.151
before their time,
brief though it may be.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.612
- What are you doing?
- I've been one of them.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.821
The more she has,
the stronger she feels.

10:55.863 --> 10:58.074
She won't want to lose so many.

10:58.115 --> 11:01.160
For the sake
of preserving lives,

11:01.202 --> 11:03.829
I will grant you one hour

11:03.871 --> 11:05.581
to peacefully surrender.

11:05.623 --> 11:08.834
Let your army think carefully

11:08.876 --> 11:13.255
before following you
to their graves.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.467
So it kills
anything you touch?

11:16.509 --> 11:18.302
Yes.

11:18.344 --> 11:21.305
But my kinj makes me immune
to the effects of other kinjes.

11:21.347 --> 11:24.308
No, not the black one.
The Terakinj.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.852
If I touch you,
it will destroy you

11:26.894 --> 11:29.146
and anything inside you,
including your kinj.

11:29.188 --> 11:31.315
So it'll kill Yavalla
and her white kinj?

11:31.357 --> 11:32.983
If I can get close enough
to her, yes.

11:33.025 --> 11:35.277
Then there's no time to waste.

11:35.319 --> 11:38.781
We have to bring you back
with us right now.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.283
And what are you gonna do, huh?

11:41.325 --> 11:46.288
Pick me up
and throw me at Yavalla?
I can barely move.

11:46.330 --> 11:49.417
I had those spears stuck in me
for gods know how long.

11:49.458 --> 11:52.169
Look at me.
And if any of you
tries to help--

11:52.211 --> 11:53.713
Yes. Dead, we know.

11:56.340 --> 11:58.259
Can the Terakinj
be passed to someone else?

11:58.300 --> 12:01.512
Yes, but not to one
who already has a kinj in them.

12:01.554 --> 12:05.433
Wren.
You can pass it to Wren,

12:05.474 --> 12:06.976
and she can get close
to Yavalla.

12:07.017 --> 12:08.686
How would you get close
to Yavalla?

12:08.728 --> 12:10.020
Yavalla's my mother.

12:10.062 --> 12:12.398
Zed, I don't know if I could.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.858
What if I can't
bring myself to do it?

12:13.899 --> 12:17.820
No! I'm not passing it
to anyone.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.697
I've taken enough lives.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.157
I won't have a young,

12:21.198 --> 12:22.908
innocent death
on my hands as well.

12:22.950 --> 12:26.537
Death?
Why? Would Wren die?

12:26.579 --> 12:30.040
The black and white kinjes
will destroy each other,

12:30.082 --> 12:31.542
along with their host bodies.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.086
So if you touch Yavalla,
you'll both die?

12:34.128 --> 12:35.463
Yes.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.842
Is there no other way
to save my mother?

12:39.884 --> 12:42.261
She would have to give up
her kinj willingly,

12:42.303 --> 12:45.931
and the white kinj
has a steel grip on
the mind that carries it.

12:45.973 --> 12:48.017
- I'm sorry.
- If there's no other way
to save her, then I can do it.

12:48.058 --> 12:50.144
- I think. I think
I can be the one--
- No!

12:50.186 --> 12:54.440
I refuse to send a woman off
to kill her own mother.

12:54.482 --> 12:57.985
- Someone has to do it.
- The kinj will heal my insides.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.446
It could take days.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.323
You're in bad shape.
We don't have time for that.

13:02.364 --> 13:05.534
I'll do it.
I can pass my kinj to Wren,

13:05.576 --> 13:08.704
- and you can pass your--
- No! This is my burden,
no one else's.

13:08.746 --> 13:10.956
We may already be too late.

13:10.998 --> 13:15.586
I'll heal.
I just need some water.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.006
I'm thirsty as hell.

13:30.893 --> 13:32.645
It's all we had left.

13:34.396 --> 13:37.691
Go. Take the second left tunnel.

13:37.733 --> 13:39.151
There's a spring down that way.

13:39.193 --> 13:40.736
The water will help me
heal faster.

13:40.778 --> 13:42.988
( scoffs )

13:43.030 --> 13:45.533
Go. I'll stay with him.

13:45.574 --> 13:47.868
Unbelievable.

14:05.511 --> 14:08.305
Yavalla has offered us
our lives if we surrender,

14:08.347 --> 14:10.266
but they will be
very short lives.

14:10.307 --> 14:13.394
Is that what you want?

14:13.435 --> 14:16.689
Look, I am the only one
who has experienced

14:16.730 --> 14:18.941
what it's like to be part
of the United.

14:18.983 --> 14:21.610
It's like your mind
is swallowed up.

14:21.652 --> 14:25.364
Your body withers away
with every passing
of the infection.

14:25.406 --> 14:28.200
It is a slow
and awful death.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.911
And I can assure you
that it is better to die today

14:30.953 --> 14:34.039
than to have your life
sucked out of you by
that demented witch.

14:34.081 --> 14:36.500
I swear to each
and every one of you,

14:36.542 --> 14:39.295
surrender is not an option.

14:39.336 --> 14:42.172
Now, we have won
hard battles before,

14:42.214 --> 14:44.800
and we will be victorious
again today, my friends.

14:46.260 --> 14:47.720
Hail, Queen Rosmund!

14:47.761 --> 14:50.514
All: Hail, Queen Rosmund!

14:50.556 --> 14:53.893
( cheering )

14:56.854 --> 14:58.397
Well done, Your Majesty.

14:58.439 --> 14:59.899
That speech is just
what they needed to hear.

14:59.940 --> 15:01.525
Commander Spears,
listen to me.

15:01.567 --> 15:02.985
Garret:
Now we just need
to think of a way--

15:03.027 --> 15:04.153
Garret, listen to me.

15:06.906 --> 15:07.865
We can't win this fight.

15:07.907 --> 15:11.744
What? We have a chance.

15:11.785 --> 15:15.623
No. You know as well as I do
we don't have a chance.

15:15.664 --> 15:19.793
I just-- I wanted to say
that at the end of it all,
I'm glad you're here with me.

15:22.338 --> 15:24.423
You said to them
that we would win this battle.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.800
Yeah, I lied, Garret,
for their own sake.

15:28.177 --> 15:29.845
I would rather my men die
fighting today

15:29.887 --> 15:31.847
than succumb to
Yavalla's control.

15:31.889 --> 15:34.558
I have experienced
what it's like.
Death is preferable.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.893
No, there is always a way.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.437
What about Talon?
Don't give up on her yet.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.356
She's already
been gone too long.
She's probably already dead.

15:40.397 --> 15:43.859
You don't know that!
If she finds the black kinj--

15:43.901 --> 15:47.571
Yes, if, if, if!
If she finds it.
If it even exists.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.657
If she doesn't get killed
by a Blackfist or a Lu-Qiri

15:49.698 --> 15:52.159
or just the bloody environment
of that place.

15:55.579 --> 15:59.792
All right, then
we should make our escape

15:59.833 --> 16:03.003
and live another day
to figure something out.

16:03.045 --> 16:05.714
Garret, I'm not running away.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.509
There's nowhere to run.

16:13.764 --> 16:16.141
We will find a way.

16:17.434 --> 16:20.396
All right? This is--
this isn't the end.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.706
So, kill Yavalla
in a suicide attack?

16:38.747 --> 16:41.125
- That's your plan?
- Something like that.

16:43.877 --> 16:45.546
So you're just giving up
on living then?

16:45.587 --> 16:49.091
I gave up on living
the day I got this curse
handed to me.

16:52.636 --> 16:55.431
Look at you, Talon.

16:55.472 --> 16:57.683
So strong.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.351
I'm so glad I got
to see you again--

16:59.393 --> 17:01.770
Before you leave me again?

17:09.653 --> 17:12.906
( chuckling )
Your ears.

17:12.948 --> 17:14.950
Cut the points off
to blend in with humans.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.578
- It's clever.
- I didn't do it to be clever.

17:23.292 --> 17:25.335
I was scared for my life.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.546
I watched humans murder
Mother and Eremus

17:27.588 --> 17:29.631
just 'cause they had
pointy ears and black blood.

17:32.426 --> 17:34.428
They slaughtered
our entire village.

17:37.347 --> 17:39.349
I'm sorry, Talon.

17:39.391 --> 17:43.020
I only ever wanted
what was best for all of you.

17:43.062 --> 17:46.440
You were just a little girl.
Eremus had only just been born.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.734
So why'd you leave us then?

17:48.776 --> 17:50.736
The Prime Order
were gathering kinjes.

17:50.778 --> 17:53.322
I was tasked with saving
a captured Dragman.

17:53.363 --> 17:58.285
When I found her,
she reached out her hand.

17:58.327 --> 18:01.914
And like a fool, I took it.

18:05.042 --> 18:06.668
I swear to you, Talon,

18:06.710 --> 18:09.171
I had no idea what
I was doing.

18:09.213 --> 18:12.132
When I found out what kinj
she had passed to me, I--

18:12.174 --> 18:14.176
I couldn't go near any of you.

18:15.636 --> 18:17.096
It was too dangerous.

18:17.137 --> 18:19.306
You could have at least
stayed in the Realm.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.016
Look at me.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.311
Look at my existence.

18:25.562 --> 18:31.693
Any living creature
I touch dies.

18:33.529 --> 18:36.073
I couldn't be anywhere
near others.

18:36.115 --> 18:40.953
Especially not my own children.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.876
Yavalla:
Rosmund, what is your answer?

18:47.918 --> 18:50.087
Will you show mercy
to your subjects?

18:50.129 --> 18:51.713
Or will your throw away
their lives

18:51.755 --> 18:54.591
in a feeble attempt
to save your own?

18:54.633 --> 18:57.344
It is to you
that I offer mercy, Yavalla.

18:57.386 --> 19:00.055
- ( scoffs )
- You stand to lose a hundred

19:00.097 --> 19:01.515
for everyone one of us
you gain.

19:01.557 --> 19:04.977
I have been United,
and I will do anything

19:05.018 --> 19:07.521
to protect my people from you
and your control.

19:07.563 --> 19:10.607
You have made
your last mistake.

19:10.649 --> 19:14.444
Tear down the barricade
and bring me her head.

19:14.486 --> 19:17.531
- Man: Attack!
- ( shouting )

19:24.079 --> 19:26.540
Spend your arrows well!
This is only the first wave.

19:26.582 --> 19:28.208
( shouting )

19:28.250 --> 19:30.002
Spears in the front!
Two rows staggered!

19:30.043 --> 19:31.712
Crossbows in the back!

19:37.634 --> 19:40.095
( shouting )

19:40.137 --> 19:42.472
Garret: Stay strong!
Stay strong!

19:45.684 --> 19:48.020
Stay ready! Ready!

19:48.061 --> 19:50.022
( gasping )

19:52.316 --> 19:53.942
Leave it, Gwynn! Leave it!

20:03.118 --> 20:04.620
Fall back!

20:28.143 --> 20:29.186
Come on.

20:36.777 --> 20:39.238
( ghostly whispering )

20:47.454 --> 20:50.082
( screaming )

20:58.090 --> 20:59.132
( screaming )

21:07.808 --> 21:09.601
She can control it.

21:09.643 --> 21:12.312
( screaming )

21:27.703 --> 21:28.954
Falista.

21:32.958 --> 21:35.002
( panting )

21:50.851 --> 21:53.854
( groaning )

21:53.895 --> 21:57.649
- Shh.
- ( gasping )

21:59.484 --> 22:01.653
I see you learned
to control that horrible
thing inside your head.

22:01.695 --> 22:05.157
- Well done.
- I'm sorry. I tried.
There was so many of them.

22:05.198 --> 22:09.369
- Shh. Don't talk, okay?
Just breathe. Breathe.
- ( gasping )

22:09.411 --> 22:12.414
- This doesn't look good.
- We have to help her, Janzo.

22:12.456 --> 22:14.833
You must have something
that could extend her time
till the kinj can cure her.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.753
I do, in my lab.
I need my-- my hapsweed.

22:17.794 --> 22:20.297
Put this on here, please.
I need my hapsweed
and my suture kit.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.798
Without that,
there's very little I can do.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.843
And without her,
we won't survive a second wave.

22:24.885 --> 22:27.846
- All right. Then I'll go.
- Impossible.
You'll never make it--

22:27.888 --> 22:29.348
Through the same holes
in the barracks walls.

22:29.389 --> 22:30.932
If Tobin can get to Falista,

22:30.974 --> 22:32.559
then maybe I can get
to my lab and back.

22:32.601 --> 22:34.186
- I'll come with you.
- You stay here.

22:34.227 --> 22:36.730
I'll be more stealthy
by myself.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.815
- ( groans )
- Shh, shh.

22:38.857 --> 22:41.985
It's okay, it's okay.

23:13.767 --> 23:14.851
Oh.

23:22.734 --> 23:26.071
It hurts, Mum.
It hurts so much.

23:34.579 --> 23:35.622
( door closes )

23:42.796 --> 23:45.882
Tell me about yourself.
I don't know anything about you.

23:50.137 --> 23:51.680
All right, I'll go first.

23:51.721 --> 23:53.890
Since last we spoke,

23:53.932 --> 23:56.059
I've been living here
in this dank cave

23:56.101 --> 23:58.311
wondering if my daughter
was alive, if--

23:58.353 --> 24:00.105
if she was happy,
what was she doing?

24:00.147 --> 24:04.734
Does she look like
her beautiful mother?

24:04.776 --> 24:07.612
That's everything about
my life all these years.

24:11.867 --> 24:13.118
Now your turn.

24:14.995 --> 24:19.291
Well, for a long time I just
wandered from town to town.

24:19.332 --> 24:21.168
Finding food where I could,

24:21.209 --> 24:22.919
learning to fight from
whomever would teach me.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.298
I was the only
Blackblood left.

24:28.133 --> 24:29.551
Couldn't trust anyone.

24:36.016 --> 24:39.019
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry you had such
a hard life.

24:39.060 --> 24:41.313
Hardly compares
to how hard yours has been.

24:41.354 --> 24:45.650
You have your mother's
fighting spirit in you.

24:47.777 --> 24:49.529
That's how you made it
this far.

24:49.571 --> 24:51.823
( footsteps approaching )

24:58.121 --> 25:00.040
- Ready to go yet, old man?
- Almost.

25:05.795 --> 25:08.173
Okay, Janzo's gonna help you.
There's Janzo.

25:08.215 --> 25:11.384
Oh, thank you, gods.
Janzo, you're just in time.
She's not doing good.

25:20.393 --> 25:21.770
They're staying
just outside her range.

25:21.811 --> 25:23.480
It's like they're waiting
for something.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.357
( gasps )

25:33.448 --> 25:34.533
- Janzo, no!
- No!

25:34.574 --> 25:36.993
( laughs )

25:49.381 --> 25:51.258
The red power is gone.

25:51.299 --> 25:55.637
( shouting )

25:58.723 --> 26:01.017
Hold the line!
Hold the line!

26:01.059 --> 26:05.939
- Give me your sword.
- Hold! Hold strong!

26:09.192 --> 26:12.320
Come with us, Cor.
It's beautiful in their world.

26:12.362 --> 26:14.114
There's trees
as green as emeralds,

26:14.155 --> 26:16.116
water everywhere you look.

26:16.157 --> 26:20.912
No. Yavalla is there,

26:20.954 --> 26:24.708
and now death is going there.

26:33.633 --> 26:36.595
If we fix things there,
I'm coming back for you
this time, Corven.

26:36.636 --> 26:39.514
I promise.

26:42.142 --> 26:43.893
Ready?

26:47.647 --> 26:50.442
- Do we have a plan?
- We find Yavalla
and you touch her.

26:50.483 --> 26:52.485
I like this guy.

27:17.010 --> 27:18.845
You going to be all right?

27:18.887 --> 27:21.097
I'll miss you, dear Wren.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.070
( grunting, shouting )

27:39.199 --> 27:41.660
- Where's Yavalla?
- I don't know.

27:43.870 --> 27:47.374
- Janzo!
- Gwynn.

27:53.505 --> 27:54.839
Janzo? Janzo?

28:03.640 --> 28:05.100
Talon.

28:20.323 --> 28:21.741
Garret, no.

28:32.919 --> 28:34.295
Saivek.

28:34.337 --> 28:36.214
( shouting )

28:36.256 --> 28:37.882
( whistles )

28:39.050 --> 28:40.927
( snarling )

28:45.682 --> 28:47.434
Garret? Garret?

28:49.644 --> 28:51.438
Garret, easy.

28:57.777 --> 29:00.822
Garret,
I don't want to hurt you.

29:12.709 --> 29:14.169
Gwynn, where's Yavalla?

29:14.210 --> 29:15.628
We need to get him
close enough to touch her.

29:15.670 --> 29:17.756
I don't know.
She could be anywhere. Why?

29:17.797 --> 29:20.925
If he touches her,
both them and their kinjes
will die.

29:20.967 --> 29:23.428
If you don't know where she is,
who would know?

29:23.470 --> 29:25.930
Everyone I know of
is under Yavalla's control

29:25.972 --> 29:27.223
except for the people
in this room.

29:27.265 --> 29:30.852
- ( thudding )
- ( screeching )

29:52.540 --> 29:55.376
( groaning )

30:03.551 --> 30:06.262
Saivek, here we are again.

30:07.764 --> 30:11.476
Something familiar
about this situation,

30:11.518 --> 30:13.686
don't you think?

30:13.728 --> 30:15.939
Janzo, wake up. Janzo!

30:18.858 --> 30:20.902
( grunts )

30:20.944 --> 30:23.655
You should have left him
in the Plane of Ashes, Talon.

30:24.656 --> 30:26.533
Daddy can't--

30:26.574 --> 30:28.034
Mother, I won't join you.

30:28.076 --> 30:30.829
- ( gasps )
- I'd rather die.

30:30.870 --> 30:32.080
Wren.

30:34.249 --> 30:35.750
- Ketma...
- ( snarls )

30:41.881 --> 30:45.343
I'll hold her back.
Try and pry him free.

30:45.385 --> 30:46.845
But whatever you do,
don't touch him.

30:48.805 --> 30:51.516
( music playing )

31:54.120 --> 31:55.163
Xaba.

31:59.208 --> 32:03.087
Wren? Wren? Wren.

32:03.129 --> 32:05.506
Don't do this.

32:05.548 --> 32:08.676
My darling child, I--
I will not let them infect you.

32:08.718 --> 32:10.887
- You're lying. You're lying.
- No.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.472
Just like you lied to me
all along.

32:12.513 --> 32:15.475
I swear it. I swear.

32:15.516 --> 32:18.686
I will let you walk away free.

32:18.728 --> 32:21.648
I ju-- I just can't lose you.

32:24.525 --> 32:26.903
Wren, listen to me,
I am your mother.

32:26.945 --> 32:27.987
No, you're not.

32:30.865 --> 32:34.160
I don't have a mother.
Not anymore.

32:45.505 --> 32:47.924
Sorry, Mother.
Of course I didn't mean that.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.426
I know, my love.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.709
Go ahead. Do it.

33:22.750 --> 33:25.044
I will when Yavalla
commands me to.

33:39.142 --> 33:40.935
I can't do it, Talon.

33:46.065 --> 33:47.775
Together.

33:48.735 --> 33:51.070
( grunting )

33:55.700 --> 33:58.745
I'm sorry, Talon.
I failed you.

34:01.372 --> 34:04.792
Pass it to me.
I can do it.

34:04.834 --> 34:08.546
I-- I can't. You have a kinj.

34:10.214 --> 34:13.968
Go. Go, Talon!
Make your escape!

34:15.470 --> 34:20.391
Wait. You can pass
your kinj to somebody else?

34:20.433 --> 34:23.770
As long as I make contact
long enough for it to pass

34:23.811 --> 34:25.521
instead of kill the person.

34:25.563 --> 34:28.566
But it will kill him.

34:28.608 --> 34:31.235
All these years I've felt
like I wanted you dead.

34:32.945 --> 34:34.822
And now I just want
more time.

34:34.864 --> 34:36.657
I know.

34:39.243 --> 34:40.286
Me, too.

34:46.209 --> 34:48.294
Gwynn, you'll die!

34:53.966 --> 34:55.510
Sorry, Talon.

34:55.551 --> 34:57.512
( gasps )

34:57.553 --> 35:00.264
Good-bye, Talon.

35:11.234 --> 35:14.362
- Why would you do that?
- I didn't have a choice.

35:14.403 --> 35:15.822
It's for the good of the Realm.

35:15.863 --> 35:18.574
But if we lose you,
who's going to rule the Realm?

35:18.616 --> 35:21.536
You'll figure it out.

35:26.249 --> 35:28.084
I don't want to lose you, Gwynn.

35:28.126 --> 35:32.463
It's just me and you
against the world.

35:32.505 --> 35:34.423
- It's always been that way.
- It's always been that way

35:34.465 --> 35:36.050
since the day
you walked in the door.

35:36.092 --> 35:39.137
You stood by me in every
bad decision I've ever made

35:39.178 --> 35:40.221
and you're my best friend.

35:46.394 --> 35:49.021
- Are you ready?
- No.

35:50.648 --> 35:51.941
Are you?

35:51.983 --> 35:54.735
Not in the least.

36:10.835 --> 36:13.462
Victory is mine.

36:19.510 --> 36:20.887
Zed?

36:40.114 --> 36:41.490
Now do you see?

36:41.532 --> 36:44.911
Admit it, it was
a mistake to betray me.

36:44.952 --> 36:46.787
- You--
- ( door opens )

37:03.554 --> 37:05.389
You're alive?

37:06.849 --> 37:09.977
- Where is Ketma?
- ( whistling )

37:10.019 --> 37:11.229
What about Saivek?

37:13.439 --> 37:16.400
- He's dead.
- He cannot die. He's--

37:17.360 --> 37:18.736
Stop them.

37:20.905 --> 37:22.365
Stop them!

37:46.973 --> 37:48.266
- You lose, Yavalla.
- No.

37:48.307 --> 37:50.017
Die, you witch!

37:50.059 --> 37:53.562
( both screaming )

38:18.421 --> 38:22.049
( murmuring )

38:37.815 --> 38:42.153
( cheering )

39:25.321 --> 39:27.281
- Falista. Falista!
- I'm all right.

39:36.624 --> 39:39.085
She's alive.

39:39.126 --> 39:42.088
Her kinj must have kept
her alive.

40:00.147 --> 40:02.191
Why are they kneeling?

40:02.233 --> 40:04.944
They're bending the knee
to you, Talon.

40:04.985 --> 40:06.654
They see you
as their new leader.

40:10.032 --> 40:11.742
Their leader is dead.

40:11.784 --> 40:13.994
Long live their new leader.

40:16.414 --> 40:20.376
( music playing )

40:56.662 --> 40:57.788
What have they done?

40:57.830 --> 40:59.915
They released the gods.

41:01.625 --> 41:04.753
( music playing )
