WEBVTT

02:19.640 --> 02:23.160
Everybody get back! Get back!

02:24.720 --> 02:27.360
- Whoo... Whoo!
- Oh, yeah!

02:32.560 --> 02:34.400
- Whoo... -
Ha-ha... Ha-ha!

02:49.080 --> 02:53.480
Ha-ha!
Ha-ha! Yeah!

03:21.640 --> 03:23.160
Yeah!

04:04.000 --> 04:07.400
It's Sarah... Her fever has risen again.

04:21.640 --> 04:24.840
What do we do? She's
been sick for a month.

04:24.840 --> 04:27.040
How are you feeling?

04:27.040 --> 04:28.800
It's just a cold, Daddy.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.640
Nothing to worry about.

04:33.480 --> 04:34.760
You're strong.

04:40.400 --> 04:43.880
Caroline is sick too.
You need to find a doctor.

04:49.360 --> 04:53.120
This is all we have.
Take it, and God help us.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.360
Elijah!

05:19.600 --> 05:20.960
Sarah got worse.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.840
What do you want?

05:25.840 --> 05:27.600
How much money do you have?

05:28.400 --> 05:31.480
I have one dollar fifty, it's not
going to be enough for the doctor.

05:34.880 --> 05:38.240
This wind never stops,
it's driving me crazy.

05:38.240 --> 05:40.120
Look at me.

05:40.120 --> 05:42.440
Elijah. Give me whatever you have.

05:42.440 --> 05:45.240
I'm going to Lost Mercy and
bring back Reverend Young.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.680
You break your hands here all
you like, but nothing grows.

05:51.360 --> 05:54.640
Are you listening to me?

05:57.000 --> 05:59.200
No, you're not. You're
not listening to me.

05:59.200 --> 06:00.800
You're not paying any attention.

06:00.800 --> 06:04.120
We need a doctor, you
hear me? I need the money.

06:04.120 --> 06:06.200
I need to go get a doctor!

06:08.800 --> 06:10.040
I've never felt so al
-...

06:10.040 --> 06:11.400
Hey!

06:12.920 --> 06:14.200
Get a grip!

06:16.120 --> 06:17.160
Get a grip.

06:18.480 --> 06:20.160
Sarah is dying.

06:20.160 --> 06:21.600
Caroline needs you.

06:21.640 --> 06:24.960
Margaret needs me. We need
to hurry up. Do you hear that?

06:30.080 --> 06:31.680
Caroline's pregnant.

06:31.680 --> 06:32.800
Great.

06:32.800 --> 06:34.720
I'm going to get a doctor
and we'll be alright.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.120
No, but you don't get it, do you?

06:36.120 --> 06:38.440
I don't want a baby with
her, I don't want it.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.040
Well, it's not up to you!

06:44.640 --> 06:46.520
I love you, Julian.

06:51.560 --> 06:53.360
I love you!

07:05.120 --> 07:07.760
Your wife needs you
and my wife needs me.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.960
My children need me.
Do you understand that?

07:23.440 --> 07:24.720
Julian.

07:29.160 --> 07:31.280
I'm c
- I'm coming with you.

07:39.080 --> 07:41.040
So, how many barrels of oil we got?

07:41.040 --> 07:43.040
Three barrels, so far.

07:43.920 --> 07:47.480
We can probably ramp it up to ten
a day, once we get a rhythm going.

07:47.480 --> 07:50.360
We can drill a new well
every couple of weeks.

07:50.360 --> 07:52.600
Market price is around
three dollars a barrel.

07:52.600 --> 07:55.520
So, let's say, in six
months we have twelve wells,

07:55.520 --> 07:58.480
ten barrels a day each, that's...

08:00.600 --> 08:03.680
That's over 100,000 dollars a year.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.760
It can be really good for us.

08:10.440 --> 08:13.680
Yeah. That's if we can find a buyer.

08:13.680 --> 08:17.360
- Nah, we'll find someone, Pops.
- Where? Elmdale?

08:19.440 --> 08:21.880
You think Elizabeth's gonna
let us just walk up in there

08:21.880 --> 08:23.360
with fifty barrels of oil?

08:23.360 --> 08:26.400
Houston, then. Or, San Antonio.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.400
San Antonio's 200 miles.

08:29.720 --> 08:32.240
I mean, we'd have to go
through the valley either way.

08:32.240 --> 08:34.120
And after what happened at the bank,

08:34.120 --> 08:35.680
it would be too risky for you, Dad.

08:37.040 --> 08:38.840
Not if we go to Pueblo.

08:51.480 --> 08:53.480
Pueblo's four buildings in a swamp.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.040
I've taken shits bigger than Pueblo.

08:57.440 --> 08:59.080
Pueblo's on the river.

09:05.400 --> 09:07.800
We take a boat to Pueblo
and meet the buyer there.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.600
We won't go through the valley.

09:13.440 --> 09:15.160
The Lady's none the wiser.

09:24.720 --> 09:28.720
And who's arranging the sale? You?

09:29.880 --> 09:31.920
If I can bring a gun with me.

09:31.920 --> 09:33.480
I'll go with him.

09:37.400 --> 09:39.680
No, you need to stay here
and manage the production.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.760
Kevin will go.

09:40.760 --> 09:42.560
I don't need Kevin.

09:46.240 --> 09:47.600
I just need a gun.

09:55.120 --> 09:56.920
What do you want me to do?

09:57.840 --> 10:00.640
I won't be here to protect
you forever, sweetheart.

10:00.640 --> 10:03.640
It's time for you to
learn to protect yourself.

10:06.360 --> 10:08.600
See? Hold it like that.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.640
Now you can't shoot.

10:11.640 --> 10:15.240
To drop a shot in the barrel,
you have to lower the lever...

10:15.240 --> 10:18.120
That's right. Then you...

10:18.120 --> 10:20.920
Mama! How am I supposed
to shoot? I can't see!

10:20.920 --> 10:24.920
You don't know what it's like
to live in absolute darkness.

10:28.920 --> 10:32.480
Blaine. Give me your scarf.

10:33.360 --> 10:34.880
As you wish.

10:50.720 --> 10:53.480
You see? Now I'm as blind as you.

11:14.520 --> 11:17.800
Now... Was it a hit?

11:17.800 --> 11:19.160
Yes, ma'am.

11:19.160 --> 11:21.840
If I can, you can.

11:21.840 --> 11:25.080
'Cause you're my son. You're my blood.

11:25.080 --> 11:26.440
Now it's your turn.

11:26.440 --> 11:30.360
Mama, I know how much you wish
I was like you, but I'm not.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.240
I'm different.

11:40.680 --> 11:42.560
If we get those barrels over here...

11:47.840 --> 11:50.040
Stop lollygagging.

11:50.040 --> 11:51.400
What you doin' here?

11:51.400 --> 11:53.200
I figured you'd need some help.

11:54.440 --> 11:56.360
Is that what my father said?

11:56.360 --> 11:58.800
Well, he doesn't know I'm here.

12:06.520 --> 12:08.000
Who are you, stranger?

12:09.160 --> 12:11.840
Someone trying to be a friend.

12:11.840 --> 12:13.440
Seymour, it's ready!

13:02.200 --> 13:03.480
Reverend!

13:10.760 --> 13:12.240
Reverend!

13:28.280 --> 13:29.760
Sir...

13:32.840 --> 13:34.920
Sir, we're not here to make any trouble.

13:37.080 --> 13:40.040
My name is Julian Wright,

13:40.040 --> 13:42.000
his name is Elijah, tell him your name.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.280
Elijah Turner.

13:44.280 --> 13:46.160
We live southwest from the river,

13:46.160 --> 13:48.440
we're just settlers and we
came to ask you something.

13:48.440 --> 13:50.280
Never seen you here.

13:50.280 --> 13:52.280
We
- We were never here before.

13:53.120 --> 13:56.800
We heard you studied medicine before
you took the cross, is that right?

13:59.000 --> 14:00.360
Is that right, sir?

14:04.400 --> 14:05.680
Give it to him.

14:05.680 --> 14:07.080
C'mon, give it.

14:14.400 --> 14:15.760
Came to ask for your help.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.880
Pardon my welcome, but you never know

14:29.920 --> 14:32.720
when it's a wolf showing
up in sheep's drawers.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.640
You were probably expecting Comanches.

14:37.440 --> 14:38.600
How do you know?

14:38.600 --> 14:40.560
Because we've been
around here long enough.

14:43.280 --> 14:46.360
They don't like houses
of the Lord on their land.

14:47.960 --> 14:51.360
And from their point of
view, they're not wrong.

14:55.040 --> 14:58.120
I consider this a
contribution to our community.

15:03.600 --> 15:07.760
Ah... Can't get by on
the Holy Spirit alone.

15:18.480 --> 15:20.480
Do you think we should trust him?

15:21.520 --> 15:25.400
Well, he's the only chance we
have. So, it doesn't matter.

15:30.920 --> 15:34.120
- I didn't see your horses.
- We don't have any.

15:34.120 --> 15:35.920
I can only take one of you.

15:35.920 --> 15:38.680
Well, you go. You get
there as fast as you can.

16:24.440 --> 16:25.720
Hmm...

16:37.960 --> 16:39.320
I don't trust you.

16:40.560 --> 16:43.800
Huh. Well, one day you will.

16:46.560 --> 16:47.960
I don't think so.

16:53.720 --> 16:55.800
How did Sarah end up with you all?

16:59.560 --> 17:01.520
That's none of your business.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.120
How old was she?

17:22.520 --> 17:23.960
She's mine.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.480
Ain't nothing you can do about that.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.320
I'm not doing anything

17:31.400 --> 17:33.200
I see the way you look at her.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.280
No, you don't know what
you're talking about.

17:35.280 --> 17:37.040
I know what I see!

17:46.040 --> 17:47.680
All I'm saying is...

17:49.840 --> 17:51.640
..she's your father's wife.

18:08.240 --> 18:09.520
Fuck you.

18:46.600 --> 18:48.760
I'm going southwest from the river.

18:50.400 --> 18:53.120
- Hop on in, friend.
- Thank you, sir.

18:58.120 --> 18:59.360
Let's go!

19:08.480 --> 19:11.200
Grant's marching south, we
need men to help stop him.

19:12.160 --> 19:16.520
Thank you for the ride, sir, but
I'm not really much of a fighter.

19:16.520 --> 19:19.840
All we're looking for is men
willing to defend their homes.

19:21.440 --> 19:23.800
I understand that, but...

19:23.800 --> 19:26.440
..I can barely defend
my home from the wind.

19:27.840 --> 19:30.800
And one of my children might
not make it through the night.

19:31.720 --> 19:33.160
I have to be home.

19:33.160 --> 19:35.880
The entire regiment is full of
men just like you who are willing

19:35.880 --> 19:39.160
to defend our rights as
free and independent states.

19:39.160 --> 19:43.800
I appreciate it, but as
I said, I'm not your man.

19:48.520 --> 19:53.000
The Second Corps is currently
offering a very generous

19:53.000 --> 19:56.240
enlistment bonus to any
man who puts on a uniform.

19:57.240 --> 20:02.400
A hundred dollars.
Transferrable to the next of kin.

20:16.600 --> 20:19.720
Cough a little bit.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.960
And now take a deep breath.

20:44.840 --> 20:47.320
Good you came when you did.

20:47.320 --> 20:49.680
Another couple of days
would have been too late.

20:52.960 --> 20:56.080
Ten drops in the morning and
the evening, for two weeks.

20:56.080 --> 20:58.960
And keep them in bed,
as much as you can.

21:02.760 --> 21:05.840
Thank you. Thank you so much.

21:09.400 --> 21:12.760
I didn't want to say this
in front of your wife,

21:12.760 --> 21:16.240
but your daughter has
a severe infection.

21:16.240 --> 21:20.240
Her right leg is never
going to work properly again.

21:20.240 --> 21:21.520
And Caroline?

21:22.400 --> 21:23.880
Malaria for her.

21:25.240 --> 21:28.960
This is about the worst
place on God's earth

21:28.960 --> 21:31.120
to bring your beautiful families.

21:32.600 --> 21:35.800
If I were you, I'd keep moving.

21:35.800 --> 21:37.480
Well, we can't afford to.

21:49.920 --> 21:54.680
Whiskey and a couple of
dried hares are enough for me.

21:54.680 --> 21:59.080
But, I warn you, they're both
sick because of malnutrition

21:59.080 --> 22:00.680
and poor conditions.

22:02.080 --> 22:06.200
God is giving you a
warning. Best listen to him.

22:32.400 --> 22:33.800
Welcome.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.440
It's an ambush.

23:01.360 --> 23:03.240
Watch out!

23:24.280 --> 23:27.600
Stop shooting! Stop
shooting, we surrender!

23:29.120 --> 23:30.600
Stop shooting!

23:35.560 --> 23:37.240
Drop the gun...

23:37.240 --> 23:39.240
- Put the gun...
- Put the gun down...

23:39.240 --> 23:42.240
Put the gun down and come forward.

23:42.240 --> 23:44.320
- Real easy.
- Slowly in...

23:46.680 --> 23:48.400
Keep those hands up-

24:11.440 --> 24:15.520
If you're gonna kill me, go ahead.

24:16.560 --> 24:19.040
I
- I don't wanna kill you, Seymour.

24:51.160 --> 24:53.680
There were at least half a
dozen of them waiting for us.

24:53.680 --> 24:55.960
They took Seymour, and
sent me back to tell you

24:55.960 --> 24:58.400
Elizabeth wants a parley. Today.

24:58.400 --> 25:00.600
- I don't like it.
- Neither do I.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.880
Alright, take me to the meeting place.

25:16.880 --> 25:20.880
We're coming with you.
It's our land, our family.

25:32.600 --> 25:34.760
I know your father better than you.

25:35.560 --> 25:39.040
He never once thinks
about anyone but himself.

25:40.160 --> 25:43.160
My father ain't perfect, I know that.

25:46.040 --> 25:47.600
But he takes care of everyone.

25:49.200 --> 25:51.080
He's a leader in the community.

25:51.080 --> 25:52.120
Hmm...

25:52.120 --> 25:53.560
Well-

25:53.560 --> 25:57.320
He did
- He did marry the girl he raised as a daughter.

25:59.200 --> 26:00.480
Didn't he?

26:02.920 --> 26:04.680
I wanna offer you a deal.

26:05.720 --> 26:11.320
You help me take back my land and
you get to lead the extraction.

26:13.440 --> 26:15.720
With all the compensation that implies.

26:16.480 --> 26:17.960
It's not your land.

26:19.640 --> 26:21.640
Your father left it to my father.

26:21.640 --> 26:23.840
The land belongs to me.

26:25.800 --> 26:28.000
I'll get it back, one way or another.

26:39.440 --> 26:41.240
You must be starving.

26:42.040 --> 26:45.200
You see, in this
household, we don't starve.

26:46.400 --> 26:49.800
Now, Seymour.

26:49.800 --> 26:53.720
Now you eat and you let
me know what you decide.

27:49.520 --> 27:50.840
Where's my boy?

27:51.680 --> 27:53.520
He's safe.

27:53.520 --> 27:58.240
Then bring him back to me,
and leave us the hell alone.

27:58.240 --> 28:00.120
Hostilities ending.

28:00.120 --> 28:02.200
Not good enough, I'm afraid.

28:03.520 --> 28:05.880
As long as you...

28:05.880 --> 28:09.640
..and your sinners are
there in that dirty hole.

28:10.680 --> 28:12.640
We ain't breaking any laws.

28:14.720 --> 28:16.440
How much do you want?

28:18.120 --> 28:19.600
It's not for sale.

28:21.320 --> 28:26.440
A hundred thousand dollars?
That's ten times what it's worth.

28:26.440 --> 28:30.120
What it was worth. Before we found oil.

28:31.720 --> 28:34.680
You've got no idea how
much you have in there.

28:35.800 --> 28:37.280
And you do?

28:41.040 --> 28:43.400
You're being short-sighted, John.

28:43.440 --> 28:48.280
I can give you cash today,
more than you've ever seen

28:48.320 --> 28:49.880
in your miserable life.

28:51.840 --> 28:56.360
All you have to do is
take your family and leave.

28:57.120 --> 28:59.480
And never come back again.

28:59.480 --> 29:00.960
What about Seymour?

29:03.360 --> 29:05.760
The child bride speaks.

29:08.680 --> 29:11.120
I need an answer today.

29:11.120 --> 29:15.840
Either you take your chances on
dry wells and endless wars, or...

29:15.840 --> 29:19.280
..you walk away richer
than you ever dreamt.

29:20.400 --> 29:25.480
It's our town. Our fate.

29:25.480 --> 29:27.680
It's your son, John.

29:27.680 --> 29:31.920
You walk away, and you're
signing his death warrant.

29:41.680 --> 29:47.320
Elizabeth, I will never
give you what you want.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
So, next time you come after me,

29:54.520 --> 29:56.480
you better bring more men.

30:37.200 --> 30:40.160
I know what it means to
love against your will.

30:41.080 --> 30:45.800
To love someone who
only cares about himself.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.600
It feels like you're...

30:48.880 --> 30:51.640
..slowly drowning and you can't breathe.

30:54.520 --> 30:55.880
Then you start...

30:56.680 --> 31:00.280
..hating yourself for being that weak.

31:02.640 --> 31:04.720
There's only one thing you can do.

31:05.680 --> 31:09.520
You have to decide that it's not you,

31:11.000 --> 31:12.560
it's him you hate.

31:13.440 --> 31:14.920
And then...

31:15.720 --> 31:17.240
Then you can...

31:17.240 --> 31:19.000
Then you can breathe again.

31:44.760 --> 31:46.360
I thought I was gonna die.

31:49.400 --> 31:50.600
You didn't.

31:55.760 --> 31:58.360
I was scared I was never
going to see you again.

32:00.120 --> 32:01.400
You feel this?

32:03.040 --> 32:04.400
This is real.

32:05.520 --> 32:08.480
And this... is real.

32:08.520 --> 32:10.240
It's not going anywhere.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.920
I'm not going anywhere.

32:12.920 --> 32:14.120
Promise me?

32:14.120 --> 32:15.560
I promise.

32:21.520 --> 32:23.120
Try to get some sleep.

32:25.640 --> 32:27.120
So...

32:29.720 --> 32:31.200
So you can recover.

33:03.040 --> 33:04.640
I have something for you.

33:08.680 --> 33:13.360
Good for an ox, a plow,
maybe a... maybe a water tank.

33:13.360 --> 33:14.680
Take it.

33:16.400 --> 33:17.440
Where'd you get that?

33:18.320 --> 33:20.920
I joined the Confederate
Army, I'm going to war.

33:21.760 --> 33:23.520
What?

33:23.520 --> 33:25.480
You remember what the reverend said?

33:26.320 --> 33:29.520
God sent us a warning,
I just listened to it.

33:30.600 --> 33:33.000
Come on, take it. You don't
wanna see your boy grow up?

33:37.720 --> 33:39.440
So that's it. You're-

33:39.440 --> 33:41.840
You're leaving? You're
just walking away?

33:43.720 --> 33:44.920
God says?

33:46.520 --> 33:48.880
You know what, Julian Wright?
I don't believe in that God.

33:48.880 --> 33:50.240
You're not leaving to save us.

33:50.240 --> 33:52.320
You're leaving because
you wanna get away from me.

33:52.320 --> 33:54.680
Because you can't take this
anymore, and neither can I.

33:59.360 --> 34:00.640
This is not about you.

34:00.640 --> 34:02.680
You don't know what it is
to have your kids ask you

34:02.680 --> 34:04.600
what they're gonna
eat every night do you?

34:05.840 --> 34:08.600
I'm not leaving for you.
I'm leaving for them.

34:08.640 --> 34:11.440
And you're staying for the
same reason, you hear me?

34:11.440 --> 34:14.680
You hear me? Uh!

34:26.960 --> 34:28.720
I'm sorry, man.

34:30.800 --> 34:35.040
I'm sorry... come here. I'm sorry.

34:57.760 --> 34:59.360
I'll make it back, don't worry.

35:28.400 --> 35:30.200
I'm leaving two days from now.

35:31.520 --> 35:33.360
Leaving for where?

35:33.360 --> 35:35.040
I'm going to war.

35:38.320 --> 35:39.960
What?

35:39.960 --> 35:41.240
I'm going to war.

35:42.920 --> 35:44.360
This was your idea.

35:45.760 --> 35:47.880
You're the one that brought
us all the way out here.

35:47.880 --> 35:49.520
There's no other way around it.

35:50.800 --> 35:53.280
We're not going to make it
out here if I don't do it.

35:53.280 --> 35:54.600
That's the way it is. I'm sorry.

35:54.600 --> 35:55.640
You're sorry?

35:57.480 --> 35:59.160
You're not coming back, are you?

36:01.160 --> 36:02.720
I will come back, don't worry.

36:04.280 --> 36:06.920
If I don't come back, the
army will take care of you.

36:06.920 --> 36:08.280
And your brother.

36:08.280 --> 36:10.120
You'll never come back.

36:10.120 --> 36:11.760
It's just a few months.

36:11.760 --> 36:14.080
What am I going to do without you?

36:17.400 --> 36:21.520
I do it for you, and for us.

36:21.520 --> 36:23.360
- For me?
- Yeah.

36:26.440 --> 36:28.400
Do you remember when we met?

36:33.360 --> 36:34.760
You looked like a king,

36:36.160 --> 36:39.240
wonderful, I fell in love

36:40.400 --> 36:41.680
..but I was wrong.

36:43.280 --> 36:46.920
You're not that king. You never were.

36:51.800 --> 36:53.880
You're just a fool.

36:53.880 --> 36:56.440
Desperate bastard who runs
around and you have no idea where

36:56.440 --> 36:58.160
you're headed, do you?

37:00.000 --> 37:05.840
And the thing is, Julian, I
loved you even more for it.

37:08.600 --> 37:10.480
And I know you love us too.

37:12.360 --> 37:15.560
But I also know that
whenever you're with us,

37:15.560 --> 37:18.760
you always wanna be
somewhere else. Don't you?

37:21.480 --> 37:24.080
I'm doing this for you.
You've got that right.

37:25.360 --> 37:26.400
For us.

37:26.400 --> 37:28.360
You stay if you want to do this for us.

37:28.360 --> 37:32.400
Stay with us. You wanna
get yourself killed?

37:32.400 --> 37:34.200
I can't stop you.

37:41.240 --> 37:45.920
Timmy and Sammy, they're
too young to understand.

37:47.160 --> 37:48.480
But Sarah?

37:49.800 --> 37:52.200
Don't expect me to be
the one to tell her.

38:24.720 --> 38:26.480
Two y'all go round the back.

38:48.920 --> 38:50.440
Ain't gonna hurt you, miss.

38:51.320 --> 38:55.480
We're here for my son.
You know where he at?

38:59.320 --> 39:03.200
Come on. It's all right!

39:18.320 --> 39:21.400
Seymour, wake up. Come on.

40:04.160 --> 40:07.680
How dare you break into my home.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.000
I've never shot a lady,

40:53.000 --> 40:55.440
but I'm willing to make
an exception for you.

40:57.360 --> 41:02.320
Don't you dare shoot my
mother! Don't you dare shoot!

41:02.320 --> 41:05.640
- She's my mom!
- Calm down, kid. Ah!

41:05.640 --> 41:06.880
Don't shoot!

41:06.880 --> 41:08.280
Ah!

41:18.920 --> 41:20.800
Now we're all in the blind, my love.

41:30.840 --> 41:36.040
Now, take your people and leave.

41:53.080 --> 41:55.720
Untie the horses, Kevin. Come on, now.

41:55.720 --> 41:58.880
You left me there, she
could've killed me already!

41:58.880 --> 42:00.920
Yeah, well I knew she wouldn't.

42:00.920 --> 42:02.920
And I still came back for you.

43:25.360 --> 43:26.960
Is it ready?

43:26.960 --> 43:28.600
Let's try.

43:39.840 --> 43:41.320
- Does it hurt?
- No.

43:47.640 --> 43:49.200
Careful.

44:06.160 --> 44:08.560
- Careful.
- I'll be ok.

44:22.600 --> 44:25.640
I shot you. Timmy, watch out.

44:27.600 --> 44:30.920
Bang, bang!

44:30.920 --> 44:32.320
Uh-oh...

44:33.240 --> 44:35.280
You haven't told her yet, have you?

44:40.480 --> 44:42.000
No, I haven't.

45:37.560 --> 45:39.000
The wind.
