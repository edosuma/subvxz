WEBVTT

03:11.230 --> 03:13.323
Try to drink this, sweetheart.

03:23.635 --> 03:26.300
He's not gonna make
it through tomorrow.

03:28.162 --> 03:31.044
But you know, he's not
going to be alone.

03:33.143 --> 03:35.836
Doesn't that give you
any kind of comfort?

03:38.540 --> 03:41.822
I've spent so much time
with you and your father....

03:41.823 --> 03:44.651
When we were waiting for
your mother to pass....

03:45.925 --> 03:49.280
Don't you think she's there
waiting for him right now?

03:52.181 --> 03:55.070
Why don't you go in
there, talk to him?

03:55.257 --> 03:56.975
He's awake.

03:57.236 --> 03:59.200
He'll be up for a little while.

04:00.267 --> 04:02.399
Go talk to your daddy.

04:52.379 --> 04:55.813
Hey, you think you could
get me out of here?

04:56.886 --> 04:58.521
Where to?

04:59.392 --> 05:02.911
I could go for a cold
beer right about now.

05:04.970 --> 05:07.110
Is that game on?

05:07.111 --> 05:08.563
Yeah.

05:08.564 --> 05:10.249
We're playing Boston.

05:10.250 --> 05:12.797
- Yeah?
- We're losing.

05:14.370 --> 05:17.131
Alright, hold still.

05:21.059 --> 05:23.018
Where's your guy?

05:23.040 --> 05:24.608
Come on, stop it.

05:24.609 --> 05:25.891
What's his name?

05:25.892 --> 05:28.089
There is no guy.

05:29.504 --> 05:32.168
After we lost your mom....

05:33.264 --> 05:35.358
It occurred to me....

05:35.359 --> 05:38.132
Just how great that stuff was.

05:38.133 --> 05:41.232
I don't want you alone
out there, Sophia.

05:41.233 --> 05:43.143
I know.

05:43.800 --> 05:47.328
I want you to be
struck by lightning....

05:48.674 --> 05:51.727
Floored by someone you
just can't live without.

05:51.728 --> 05:53.979
Like I was.

05:55.770 --> 05:58.066
You make it sound so easy.

05:58.180 --> 05:59.785
I know.

05:59.952 --> 06:02.270
But if you pay attention....

06:02.850 --> 06:06.951
Something that profound
could actually happen.

06:07.228 --> 06:09.712
Something that profound, huh?

06:09.713 --> 06:11.453
I'm serious.

06:12.621 --> 06:15.668
I've come to a realization that....

06:15.669 --> 06:19.260
This life may actually
be all we really have.

06:20.468 --> 06:24.147
I spent my entire life
trying to live up....

06:24.148 --> 06:25.927
To something....

06:25.991 --> 06:28.006
For the church.

06:28.233 --> 06:29.375
But....

06:29.376 --> 06:31.843
Now I'm finding....

06:31.844 --> 06:34.688
I'm more alone than I ever was.

06:35.469 --> 06:38.024
I know you've been here for me.

06:38.025 --> 06:39.785
But....

06:39.786 --> 06:42.195
Everything I ever believed in....

06:42.196 --> 06:44.883
Was tested after your mom died.

06:44.884 --> 06:46.827
And the more I cried out....

06:46.828 --> 06:49.059
- The lonelier I got.
- Sshh....

06:49.060 --> 06:52.506
I don't feel it anymore, Sophia.

06:53.292 --> 06:57.210
- I think it's never really there.
- Hey, come on.

06:57.211 --> 07:00.951
I need you to consider the possibility
that I was wrong about it.

07:00.952 --> 07:03.120
I was wrong about
everything I taught you.

07:03.121 --> 07:05.137
- Dad, come on.
- Sorry.

07:05.138 --> 07:07.409
- I'm so sorry, Sophia.
- Dad....

07:07.410 --> 07:09.918
Dad, come on. Relax.

07:09.919 --> 07:11.486
Sshh.... Don't do this.

07:11.487 --> 07:14.630
- There's nothing here.
- Daddy.

07:36.234 --> 07:38.350
Many of you watch
me grow up here....

07:38.351 --> 07:42.405
In this place that my father
started more than 20 years ago.

07:43.807 --> 07:47.385
And as you know, he devoted his
life to a God he believed....

07:47.386 --> 07:49.704
Was worthy of it.

07:50.083 --> 07:52.513
That he believed was real.

07:53.452 --> 07:56.841
And as you know, he gave
his heart and soul....

07:56.842 --> 07:59.355
To a God that....

07:59.797 --> 08:02.444
Eventually took his beloved wife....

08:02.445 --> 08:04.695
My mother, from us, 6 months ago.

08:04.696 --> 08:07.721
After a year long
battle with cancer.

08:09.022 --> 08:11.515
He gave his heart
and soul to a God....

08:11.516 --> 08:13.791
That mere months
after she passed....

08:13.792 --> 08:17.355
Allowed him to be stricken
with an illness so severe....

08:17.356 --> 08:20.845
That he begged and pleaded
with this God to take him.

08:20.846 --> 08:23.170
Night after night.

08:23.326 --> 08:26.681
Just so he could have
a moment of peace.

08:28.482 --> 08:30.972
I'm not here to talk about....

08:31.260 --> 08:33.746
Where my father is going or....

08:33.746 --> 08:37.847
A God that will received him
at the holy gates of heaven....

08:39.706 --> 08:42.214
I'm here to talk about a man
who was an embodiment....

08:42.215 --> 08:45.491
Of an entire set of
believes for us.

08:45.976 --> 08:47.946
For me.

08:48.970 --> 08:50.909
Because....

08:51.036 --> 08:56.426
I've realized that that set of believes,
as solid as it may have felt....

08:56.427 --> 08:59.738
It was based entirely on his.

09:00.524 --> 09:03.612
Without him, I have
never seen a shred....

09:03.613 --> 09:05.931
Of evidence to validate....

09:05.932 --> 09:09.503
What I had naively
accepted as facts.

09:11.935 --> 09:14.115
As my father lay
on his death bed....

09:14.116 --> 09:17.408
His last words confirmed
something for me.

09:19.367 --> 09:21.720
He said he was wrong.

09:22.857 --> 09:26.302
He was wrong about all of it.

09:27.312 --> 09:30.654
And after days of soul searching....

09:30.817 --> 09:33.106
I believe he was right.

09:33.195 --> 09:38.363
There are no ghosts or demons or loved
ones waiting for us on the other side....

09:38.364 --> 09:40.619
There is nothing.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.878
There is nothing.

09:47.408 --> 09:50.130
Those children stories
we grew up believing....

09:50.131 --> 09:52.854
A grown man living in a whale....

09:52.855 --> 09:55.218
A talking bush....

09:55.563 --> 09:58.805
They're just that,
they're children stories.

10:01.740 --> 10:04.548
I'm sorry to say this here....

10:04.549 --> 10:06.334
And now.

10:08.128 --> 10:10.018
But this earth....

10:10.103 --> 10:12.904
Is all we will ever know.

10:14.138 --> 10:19.375
And I defy god of any kind
to prove me otherwise.

10:21.449 --> 10:24.662
Everyone I have
ever loved is gone.

10:28.847 --> 10:32.502
And the idea of a life
after this, it's a myth.

10:34.827 --> 10:37.012
It's a sham.

10:38.262 --> 10:41.455
And if there is a God
and you can hear me....

10:41.456 --> 10:44.447
Then fucking prove it.

11:57.119 --> 11:59.262
Are you for real right now?

12:00.214 --> 12:02.000
Seriously, Sophia.

12:02.001 --> 12:04.824
I love your work as much
as anybody else, but....

12:04.825 --> 12:07.463
Don't you think it's time
for some new stuff.

12:07.597 --> 12:10.945
Aha. So you were
thinking about it.

12:10.946 --> 12:12.815
No.

12:13.047 --> 12:15.646
- By the way, they're almost here.
- Who?

12:15.647 --> 12:18.077
This little Penny and her brother.

12:18.078 --> 12:20.308
- They're new in town.
- Here for what?

12:20.309 --> 12:21.680
We're taking them out tonight.

12:21.681 --> 12:24.118
- No, Sam.
- I'm telling you.

12:24.119 --> 12:27.803
This is just what you need.
It'll snap you right out your funk.

12:27.923 --> 12:29.744
I haven't even showered yet.

12:29.745 --> 12:32.477
Don't worry, you smell like roses.

12:32.478 --> 12:34.654
Oh, and bring the camera.

12:34.655 --> 12:37.828
You probably see something
that'll kickstart you a little bit.

12:37.829 --> 12:40.410
James is dying to meet you.

12:40.411 --> 12:42.386
- He likes brunettes.
- Who?

12:42.387 --> 12:46.455
The brother. I told him how fun
and charming you used to be.

12:46.919 --> 12:48.319
Come on.

12:48.320 --> 12:51.034
- I'm busy, Sam.
- No, you're not.

12:51.035 --> 12:53.093
You're hiding, Sophia.

12:53.395 --> 12:54.907
Come on.

12:57.194 --> 12:59.785
Sam.... I beg you.

13:01.854 --> 13:04.277
- Hey guys.
- How are you doing?

13:04.278 --> 13:05.629
Great.

13:05.630 --> 13:07.518
James, slight change of plans.

13:07.519 --> 13:10.050
Sophia's got a migraine, so it's
just gonna be the three of us.

13:10.051 --> 13:10.770
Okay.

13:10.771 --> 13:14.381
But they are beautiful,
thank you mate.

14:37.946 --> 14:41.624
Well, physically
everything is normal.

14:42.585 --> 14:45.368
Same as it was a
couple of weeks ago.

14:45.369 --> 14:50.611
Sophia, you're going to live
a long and healthy life.

14:50.927 --> 14:54.575
Good. Good cause I've....

14:54.951 --> 14:58.726
I don't know, I feel like things
haven't been right lately.

14:58.741 --> 15:02.264
Grieving is a journey.

15:02.539 --> 15:04.220
Takes time.

15:04.221 --> 15:05.974
I know it does.

15:08.433 --> 15:10.730
But I feel....

15:10.834 --> 15:12.864
I feel like....

15:12.872 --> 15:14.356
Like what?

15:16.046 --> 15:17.612
Come on.

15:18.236 --> 15:20.708
I've known you since
you were in braces.

15:21.543 --> 15:24.176
I can't even explain it.
I just feel like....

15:24.177 --> 15:26.830
It's the way people look at me.

15:28.037 --> 15:31.126
Is it similar to how you feel
when you're in high places?

15:31.127 --> 15:34.986
Because I know you've been noticing
your fear of heights a bit more.

15:34.987 --> 15:37.160
Yeah, I think that'll
always be there.

15:37.161 --> 15:41.452
Well, that's true. But I think
the fear of height....

15:41.453 --> 15:45.003
Has something to do
with a lack of control.

15:47.609 --> 15:49.198
What about your personal life?

15:49.199 --> 15:51.985
You getting out
there a little bit?

15:51.986 --> 15:54.682
It's a little slow.

15:54.782 --> 15:59.413
Sophia, I see girls your age
coming here all the time....

15:59.932 --> 16:01.866
And they all have this....

16:01.867 --> 16:05.039
Spark of hope in their eyes.

16:05.040 --> 16:08.238
They've got the whole world
laid down in front of them.

16:10.061 --> 16:12.946
That's in there, somewhere.

16:14.956 --> 16:16.994
Do you feel alone?

16:18.266 --> 16:20.002
I am alone.

16:20.781 --> 16:23.022
But that's okay,
that's just how it is.

16:23.023 --> 16:24.767
Doesn't have to be.

16:24.768 --> 16:27.850
I think maybe it does right now.

16:27.851 --> 16:28.951
Why?

16:28.952 --> 16:31.801
Because how can I possibly
lose someone else?

16:31.802 --> 16:34.491
You know? It's like....

16:35.625 --> 16:39.014
I'm not physically
built to endure it.

16:39.254 --> 16:43.877
You know? I give up another
piece of me and I lose it....

16:44.067 --> 16:47.241
So this is it, and
I'm okay with that.

16:47.831 --> 16:49.391
Are you?

16:50.051 --> 16:51.511
Yes.

17:15.876 --> 17:17.696
Oh my God!

17:19.156 --> 17:22.397
I am so sorry. Are you alright?

17:23.585 --> 17:24.887
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

17:24.887 --> 17:26.183
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

17:26.184 --> 17:28.943
Is there like a bruise
or a cut or something?

17:28.944 --> 17:30.968
No, it's okay.

17:30.969 --> 17:32.894
Here, let me help you up.

17:32.895 --> 17:34.902
I'm so sorry.

17:34.946 --> 17:38.833
I.... I run sometimes.

17:38.834 --> 17:42.212
To get there quicker. I scared
the crap out of you, didn't I?

17:42.213 --> 17:44.089
No.

17:45.668 --> 17:48.280
Yeah, you scared me half to death.

17:48.281 --> 17:50.775
Yeah, I....

17:50.776 --> 17:54.576
Don't know how I could miss you.
I'm Adam Hunts, by the way.

17:54.795 --> 17:56.967
Sophia Monet.

17:57.168 --> 18:01.495
- Like the painter?
- Yeah, exactly like him.

18:01.559 --> 18:02.863
Do you paint?

18:02.864 --> 18:05.266
No, I'm a photographer.

18:05.267 --> 18:09.466
Well, Miss Monet, I totally get being
startled in the dark. It happens.

18:09.467 --> 18:12.464
It might have been the creeper running
through the darkness that did it.

18:12.465 --> 18:15.295
Yeah. Yeah, it might have.

18:18.189 --> 18:19.288
What's wrong?

18:19.289 --> 18:21.223
Oh no, nothing.

18:21.575 --> 18:24.167
Are you sure?
It doesn't look like nothing.

18:24.168 --> 18:26.699
Yeah, it's okay. I just...

18:26.798 --> 18:29.964
I keep seeing these
blank of spots.

18:29.965 --> 18:31.707
Are you serious?

18:32.093 --> 18:35.015
Here, wait just look at me.
Look at my eyes.

18:35.016 --> 18:36.980
How's your balance?

18:38.410 --> 18:40.938
Are you messing with me?

18:42.897 --> 18:44.760
- Come on.
- You deserved it.

18:44.761 --> 18:47.389
- I was about to call an ambulance.
- Come on.

18:47.390 --> 18:50.415
- You were about to faint.
- You look a lot meaner than you look.

18:50.416 --> 18:53.349
You shouldn't tackle helpless
woman on the street.

18:53.350 --> 18:54.862
I guess not.

18:54.863 --> 18:58.267
It was valiant of you though.
Try to cure my blindness.

19:00.114 --> 19:03.641
Can I walk you and make sure
you get where you're going?

19:03.642 --> 19:06.464
I mean, I did save your eyesight.

19:07.915 --> 19:11.647
Kind of a hero.... If you want
to get technical about it.

19:13.329 --> 19:14.881
Okay.

19:14.917 --> 19:17.348
But I need you to maintain
a 3 foot perimeter.

19:17.349 --> 19:19.316
- Okay. That's fair.
- Okay.

19:19.317 --> 19:20.923
I can do that.

19:21.205 --> 19:22.710
Safety zone right here.

19:22.711 --> 19:25.827
- Wow, you really coming out of the corner.
- I hurt you, didn't I?

19:25.828 --> 19:27.915
I run fast.

19:34.060 --> 19:36.624
So, this is my building up here.

19:37.347 --> 19:39.986
- Wow.
- Yes, very impressive.

19:39.987 --> 19:42.929
That would be the little tour
group that's always there.

19:42.930 --> 19:43.672
For what?

19:43.673 --> 19:46.568
It's one of the city's oldest
building. It's like....

19:46.569 --> 19:48.789
A spooky haunted thing.

19:48.790 --> 19:50.944
That's comforting.

19:51.302 --> 19:53.886
I guess it's kind of big
with the paranormal crowd.

19:53.887 --> 19:57.391
You think they tell you something
like that, before you moved in.

19:57.392 --> 19:59.212
I wouldn't.

19:59.213 --> 20:01.159
Well, not that I....

20:01.160 --> 20:02.811
Buy into that stuff.

20:02.812 --> 20:06.353
You're creeped out by it, but you don't
believe in it. How exactly does that work?

20:07.280 --> 20:09.499
Well, I think....

20:09.500 --> 20:12.999
You grow up with an idea and it
kind of becomes engrained in you.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.284
I bet if you go on
this tour with me....

20:16.285 --> 20:18.336
You wouldn't be freaked out.

20:18.779 --> 20:21.321
Look at you. You're freaked out.
Come on.

20:21.322 --> 20:25.094
It's gonna be fun. We can make fun on
how ridiculous the whole thing is.

20:26.608 --> 20:28.366
Maybe another time.

20:28.367 --> 20:31.722
The thing is, I might
like you a little bit.

20:31.723 --> 20:34.595
And if we are gonna go out,
just for me....

20:34.596 --> 20:36.955
I think I need to know a
little bit more about you.

20:36.956 --> 20:39.308
Like maybe you could tell me....

20:39.309 --> 20:41.529
Something else you're afraid of.

20:41.719 --> 20:45.364
- I never said we were going out.
- I think you did, didn't you?

20:45.365 --> 20:46.975
Maybe it was me.

20:47.235 --> 20:50.000
Come on, humor me.
Tell me something.

20:52.719 --> 20:54.567
You first.

20:54.709 --> 20:56.292
Okay.

20:56.293 --> 20:59.226
I'm afraid of missing the boat.

20:59.535 --> 21:01.988
If I see something right
in front of me and....

21:01.989 --> 21:04.614
My gut says go after it, then....

21:04.846 --> 21:06.322
I go.

21:06.323 --> 21:08.234
Gets me in trouble sometimes.

21:08.235 --> 21:11.226
- And that's why you're a hero.
- See, you get me already.

21:11.227 --> 21:12.900
Your turn.

21:16.411 --> 21:18.743
I'm afraid of heights.

21:19.284 --> 21:21.546
Like deathly afraid.

21:21.547 --> 21:22.916
It's weird.

21:22.917 --> 21:25.901
Everybody's afraid.
That's not weird.

21:26.238 --> 21:28.593
Mine borders on extreme....

21:28.594 --> 21:31.276
I've always been a bit
of an over achiever.

21:35.379 --> 21:37.907
My car's just up here, but....

21:37.908 --> 21:40.321
Thanks for the walk.

21:40.378 --> 21:43.488
And, for restoring my vision.

21:43.869 --> 21:45.717
You're gonna let me
do this by myself?

21:45.718 --> 21:47.343
I gotta sleep up there.

21:47.344 --> 21:50.680
Hey, I'm sure you'll be fine,
big boy.

21:51.438 --> 21:54.100
Well, maybe I'll get
to run into you again....

21:54.101 --> 21:57.616
I'll walk....
Don't want to injure you.

21:57.890 --> 21:59.645
I know you think I'm crazy.

21:59.646 --> 22:01.481
But it is possible, you know.

22:01.482 --> 22:04.752
I mean something that profound
could actually happen.

22:15.586 --> 22:19.866
There is a certain mystique to
the halls of the Weldon Tower.

22:21.158 --> 22:25.044
This hall is registered with estates
that are official haunted landmarks.

22:25.130 --> 22:28.811
With the history of more paranormal
sightings than any other on record.

22:29.751 --> 22:31.004
Follow me.

22:31.005 --> 22:33.410
- You're alright there, tiger?
- Yeah.

22:34.140 --> 22:36.668
Dating back to the turn
of the 20th century....

22:36.669 --> 22:40.490
This was all a state run of hospital
where hundreds of people died.

22:40.491 --> 22:43.200
It would appear for about 25 years.

22:43.201 --> 22:46.415
Then, in the 40's they shut
it down for about a decade....

22:46.416 --> 22:49.214
Before converted the rooms
to apartment units.

22:49.559 --> 22:53.390
Many tenants have reported seeing
apparition over the years.

22:53.391 --> 22:56.785
Figures, shoveling above the halls.

22:56.786 --> 22:59.083
I'm definitely not
coming up, by the way.

22:59.084 --> 23:02.151
There are several cases where patients
reported their personal belongings missing....

23:02.152 --> 23:05.435
Of the course of a few days,
and soon after....

23:05.436 --> 23:07.769
The patients themselves
would go missing.

23:07.770 --> 23:10.069
You better hang on to your purse.

23:10.070 --> 23:14.089
Now, couple of wardens found a chest full
of the patients' missing belongings.

23:14.090 --> 23:15.854
Stashed in various places, but....

23:15.855 --> 23:18.320
No trace of the patients.

23:18.524 --> 23:21.601
And back in 1972....

23:21.602 --> 23:25.721
A renovation crew worker reported
several of his belongings missing....

23:25.722 --> 23:28.457
And soon he too went missing.

23:28.493 --> 23:31.329
Into my knowledge....

23:31.330 --> 23:33.431
He hasn't been found.

23:49.892 --> 23:51.517
Check this out.

23:51.518 --> 23:54.988
- Shouldn't we get back?
- No, come on. are you kidding?

23:54.989 --> 23:57.650
Hey, we can get in trouble.

24:00.425 --> 24:02.385
This place is old.

24:02.386 --> 24:05.012
Yeah, like you.

24:06.429 --> 24:08.368
Oh wow.

24:10.531 --> 24:12.303
Creepy kitchen.

24:12.304 --> 24:15.574
- Yeah.
- Smells like bacon.

24:15.589 --> 24:18.509
Hey, real quick thing. Smile.

24:18.594 --> 24:21.858
- That's.... I wasn't ready.
- I nailed it.

24:21.859 --> 24:23.638
- Alright.
- It's good.

24:23.639 --> 24:26.974
Horrible, hang on I have a camera.

24:27.311 --> 24:30.372
- Alright, here we go.
- You look like an alien.

24:30.373 --> 24:33.595
Wow, you are a professional.

24:35.655 --> 24:38.749
- Oh....
- I'm not ready.

24:38.750 --> 24:41.400
- Oh no. Wow.
- Not sexy.

24:41.401 --> 24:44.088
- Alright one more, one more try.
- That's amazing.

24:44.089 --> 24:45.246
- This is the one.
- Ready?

24:45.247 --> 24:48.907
Yeah, this is the one.
I'll just....

24:49.693 --> 24:51.408
That was....

25:07.405 --> 25:09.680
We thought we lost you guys.

25:13.487 --> 25:15.307
Sorry.

27:05.957 --> 27:08.422
See you guys later.

27:09.902 --> 27:12.899
Wow. You guys are really serious.

27:12.900 --> 27:16.069
Yeah, my dad signed me
up when I was younger.

27:16.070 --> 27:18.542
- I used to hate doing this.
- No, you're good.

27:18.543 --> 27:21.204
Well, I love it now.

27:21.758 --> 27:25.028
Can I show you something?
Can you get out of here?

27:25.513 --> 27:27.576
Can I shower first?

27:27.577 --> 27:29.859
No, I don't want you to miss it.

27:41.379 --> 27:43.892
- What are we waiting for?
- You'll see.

27:45.203 --> 27:46.988
Nice tights, by the way.

27:53.923 --> 27:55.497
Come here.

27:57.229 --> 27:59.927
Isn't this kind of a bad idea?

27:59.928 --> 28:02.293
You do this a lot?

28:02.323 --> 28:04.531
It's a great idea.

28:06.291 --> 28:09.405
You know I'm deathly
afraid of heights, right?

28:09.406 --> 28:10.494
I know.

28:11.542 --> 28:13.635
Okay, no no....

28:13.636 --> 28:15.420
No, no....

28:15.421 --> 28:18.935
I think this is a bad idea.

28:18.936 --> 28:23.307
- You'll like it.
- No, I'm terrified about this.

28:23.308 --> 28:25.271
Stop it. Oh my God.

28:25.272 --> 28:27.359
- No!
- I promise you, it's gonna be worth it.

28:27.360 --> 28:29.783
- Please.... What are we looking for?
- Come here.

28:29.784 --> 28:31.569
Come on.

28:38.161 --> 28:39.610
Wow.

29:24.861 --> 29:27.025
- Hey.
- Yo.

29:34.672 --> 29:36.202
You read?

29:36.610 --> 29:39.579
Yes, Sophia. I read.

29:43.788 --> 29:45.496
Oh wow.

29:46.725 --> 29:49.666
- He is handsome.
- Stop.

29:49.696 --> 29:53.211
No, I love how I spend my nights
searching for the perfect partner....

29:53.212 --> 29:56.027
And you get run over
by them on the street.

29:57.703 --> 29:59.587
What's going on with this one?

30:02.349 --> 30:04.051
Must be the flash.

30:04.052 --> 30:08.227
So, when are you and this
sprinter seeing each other again?

30:08.277 --> 30:12.002
He called me a couple of days ago,
I didn't call him back.

30:12.003 --> 30:14.282
What do you mean?
You're not into it?

30:14.535 --> 30:16.713
I just want to keep it simple.

30:17.962 --> 30:20.701
Seems like maybe that's
not an option with him.

30:20.702 --> 30:23.533
Oh, because he isn't capable....

30:23.534 --> 30:25.311
Or you aren't?

30:25.368 --> 30:27.314
You....

30:28.177 --> 30:31.172
Wow.... So you're that girl now.

30:31.173 --> 30:34.825
Good for you,
if you're lucky this way....

30:34.826 --> 30:37.732
He can disappear and you
can be alone some more.

30:37.733 --> 30:39.125
Funny.

30:39.126 --> 30:40.912
You're an ass, you know that?

30:40.913 --> 30:42.666
No, I'm serious.

30:42.667 --> 30:45.000
Happiness is not allowed in here.

30:45.001 --> 30:47.529
- You know that?
- I'm not listening.

31:20.471 --> 31:23.830
Hey, I just want to throw
this out there one last time.

31:23.831 --> 31:27.546
I know you're a little
jumpy and I get it but....

31:27.547 --> 31:30.334
I don't know,
I thought we had fun.

31:30.629 --> 31:32.759
I did anyway, so....

31:32.760 --> 31:35.000
I was actually thinking to
skydiving this weekend....

31:35.001 --> 31:37.661
I know you're into that sort of thing,
so I figured maybe you'd want to....

31:37.662 --> 31:40.106
Jump out of an airplane with me.

31:40.114 --> 31:42.970
Anyway, just give me a favor
and shoot me a quick text.

31:42.971 --> 31:45.457
So I at least know you're okay.

31:45.458 --> 31:48.694
If you're not into hanging
out again, it's all good.

31:48.695 --> 31:50.936
You know? I get it.

32:23.488 --> 32:24.979
Hello?

32:26.380 --> 32:28.383
Hey!

32:29.239 --> 32:31.170
Don't tell me I scared you.

32:31.171 --> 32:33.335
You're messing with me
right now, seriously?

32:33.336 --> 32:36.046
No, I'm on my way home.

32:36.047 --> 32:38.219
I'm stuffing at
Penny's tonight so....

32:38.220 --> 32:42.022
If you and prince charming want
the place, it's all yours.

32:42.399 --> 32:44.717
I never called him back.

32:45.545 --> 32:48.600
2 weeks?
And you never called him back?

32:48.601 --> 32:51.871
Oh my word, you are
turning to the ice queen.

32:54.060 --> 32:56.496
I'm awful, aren't I?

32:57.545 --> 32:59.099
Yes.

32:59.136 --> 33:01.902
- Yes you are.
- Yeah, alright.

33:01.903 --> 33:04.168
- Good talk.
- Good talk.

34:46.253 --> 34:47.527
Hello?

34:47.899 --> 34:50.581
- Hey.
- Sophia?

34:51.464 --> 34:53.101
Yeah.

34:53.480 --> 34:55.952
Hi, I'm sorry I called so late.

34:55.953 --> 34:58.830
- Are you alright?
- Yeah.

34:58.831 --> 35:01.310
Yeah, I don't even
know why I called.

35:02.018 --> 35:04.223
Tell me what's going on.

35:04.631 --> 35:07.890
I'm just really freaked out and
I needed to talk to someone.

35:07.891 --> 35:09.681
Okay.

35:09.682 --> 35:11.965
Are you.... What happened?

35:13.357 --> 35:16.319
I woke up in the middle of the
night and I couldn't breathe.

35:16.320 --> 35:18.633
I don't know if it's just
a really vivid dream....

35:18.634 --> 35:21.624
- Or....
- You want me to come over?

35:22.151 --> 35:23.736
No, you don't have to do that.

35:23.737 --> 35:24.381
Well....

35:24.382 --> 35:27.153
I don't even know if I
want to be here right now.

35:27.154 --> 35:30.312
Come over here, I'll pick you up.

35:30.313 --> 35:32.504
- To your place?
- Yeah.

35:34.841 --> 35:36.360
Okay.

35:37.160 --> 35:39.837
Okay, but you don't have
to drive. I can drive.

35:39.838 --> 35:42.483
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

35:42.597 --> 35:44.571
What's your apartment number?

35:44.572 --> 35:46.355
2112.

35:46.356 --> 35:49.101
- On the 21st floor?
- Yeah.

35:49.102 --> 35:51.845
I'll keep you away from
the windows, I promise.

35:52.561 --> 35:53.969
Okay.

35:53.970 --> 35:56.662
- I'll see you soon.
- Okay, bye.

36:22.632 --> 36:25.381
Excuse me, are there stairs?

36:27.148 --> 36:30.126
The stairs have been
closed since the 70s, mam.

36:31.080 --> 36:33.228
Don't tell the fire marshall.

36:34.867 --> 36:38.229
No seriously, is the
elevator the only way up?

36:38.230 --> 36:41.321
Take the fire escape outside
if you want to, sweetheart.

36:41.378 --> 36:44.880
But I'm pretty sure that thing
hasn't been used since the 20s.

37:12.773 --> 37:13.922
Hey.

37:13.923 --> 37:16.079
- Hey.
- Come on in.

37:17.676 --> 37:21.493
I'm sorry I didn't call,
I have been thinking about you.

37:23.522 --> 37:26.534
It's fine. Sit down,
I got something for you.

37:32.365 --> 37:36.350
It's just something my mom used
to make for me, when I was a kid.

37:36.351 --> 37:38.522
- Hot chocolate?
- Oh yeah.

37:38.523 --> 37:40.186
You are such a little boy.

37:40.187 --> 37:41.889
I know, I can't help it.

37:41.890 --> 37:45.175
- Do you have marshmallows?
- Of course I do.

37:51.576 --> 37:54.665
- Feeling better?
- Yeah, thanks.

37:54.666 --> 37:56.675
That wasn't convincing.

37:58.105 --> 37:59.841
Try some of that.

38:06.791 --> 38:10.244
Tell me about this dream,
you couldn't breathe?

38:10.911 --> 38:12.809
It's gonna weird you out.

38:12.810 --> 38:14.316
If it can.

38:14.317 --> 38:15.807
Okay.

38:16.704 --> 38:20.170
Both my parents died within
6 months of each other.

38:20.459 --> 38:22.166
Recently.

38:22.230 --> 38:24.239
My God, that's terrible.

38:24.240 --> 38:27.077
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's okay.

38:28.455 --> 38:30.696
I just sort of came to
the realization that....

38:30.697 --> 38:32.924
There's nothing really
out there, you know?

38:33.780 --> 38:35.825
You die and that's it.

38:35.826 --> 38:40.204
I actually started challenging
anything to prove me wrong....

38:40.261 --> 38:44.842
And now I don't know, I feel like I keep
noticing all these weird little things, like....

38:44.907 --> 38:47.630
Especially after that tour we took.

38:47.694 --> 38:50.701
And now this.

38:50.884 --> 38:53.527
Do you think you open
yourself up to something or....

38:53.528 --> 38:54.275
How?

38:54.276 --> 38:58.054
I don't know, by challenging it?

38:58.420 --> 39:00.127
Whatever you did.

39:00.373 --> 39:03.579
I'd have to actually believe
in it, and I just don't...

39:04.456 --> 39:06.328
It's like Santa Clause.

39:06.329 --> 39:10.440
You grow up your whole life believing he's
real and then you find out he's not...

39:10.550 --> 39:14.184
It would take Santa himself hitting you
over the head to prove you're wrong.

39:14.347 --> 39:16.360
That makes sense.

39:16.681 --> 39:18.606
It's violent but...

39:23.469 --> 39:26.347
- These are ridiculous.
- I know.

39:28.844 --> 39:31.499
Look, I want you to know
it's not that I...

39:31.500 --> 39:33.602
Didn't like you... I...

39:33.603 --> 39:36.067
Just don't have a phone?

39:36.068 --> 39:38.413
You have a phone, it's fine.

39:38.414 --> 39:40.494
Don't worry about it.

39:52.304 --> 39:56.366
Sorry, I just really wanted
to get that out of my system.

39:56.367 --> 39:57.914
Apologies accepted.

39:57.915 --> 40:01.378
You should probably take it with
a grain of salt though, cause...

40:01.520 --> 40:03.053
You did hit me on the head.

40:03.054 --> 40:05.905
Well, I like to brain damaged
my women, good way to go.

40:05.906 --> 40:08.059
And then you apply them
with marshmallows?

40:08.060 --> 40:09.000
It's working.

40:09.001 --> 40:11.434
- It is, you monster.
- Come on.

40:11.435 --> 40:14.180
That's not even near my mouth.
Whatsoever.

40:14.181 --> 40:16.136
- You're not aiming for my mouth.
- No.

40:16.137 --> 40:18.245
You're the fine girl...

40:18.246 --> 40:20.508
Can I tell you something?
This marshmallow...

40:20.509 --> 40:23.097
Is magical.

40:23.098 --> 40:25.358
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

42:10.879 --> 42:12.272
Oh.

42:12.504 --> 42:15.233
Oh, Adam has a girl over.

42:15.234 --> 42:18.217
Yeah, I'm sorry.

42:20.635 --> 42:23.065
- Are you...
- No, not at all.

42:23.066 --> 42:25.538
He's just my roomie. I'm Astrid.

42:25.539 --> 42:27.795
Hi, I'm Sophia.

42:28.154 --> 42:29.820
My roommate’s a guy too.

42:29.821 --> 42:31.752
So much better than chicks, right?

42:31.753 --> 42:33.469
I can't stand chicks.

42:33.470 --> 42:37.112
Plus it's kinda nice having a
sexy man around the house.

42:37.113 --> 42:39.157
You like him?

42:39.936 --> 42:41.927
That's cute.

42:41.928 --> 42:45.528
Well, you have his attention and
he's a hard man to please, so...

42:46.490 --> 42:48.381
Well, I'll let you.

42:48.382 --> 42:49.774
Yeah.

43:28.589 --> 43:30.010
You knew?

43:30.760 --> 43:32.819
You knew about this?

43:33.855 --> 43:36.670
Sophia baby, I...

43:38.051 --> 43:39.687
Where did you find that letter?

43:39.688 --> 43:41.684
Did he pay you?

43:41.685 --> 43:43.526
Listen to me.

43:43.527 --> 43:46.637
Your father gave up when
we lost your mother.

43:47.199 --> 43:50.273
Honey, he didn't want you
to turn out like him.

43:51.554 --> 43:55.315
He didn't pay me, he begged
me to help him end it.

43:55.479 --> 43:57.943
And he didn't want
you to find out.

43:58.890 --> 44:02.701
- He didn't want to hurt you.
- He didn't want to hurt me?

44:03.045 --> 44:04.971
So he chose to die.

44:04.972 --> 44:07.592
He couldn't go on, Sophia.

44:07.811 --> 44:09.729
And the cancer?

44:10.571 --> 44:13.682
Was all of this just
so I wouldn't know?

44:15.105 --> 44:18.471
Your father thought that
it would be easier.

44:18.472 --> 44:21.307
If you believed that
he died naturally.

44:22.058 --> 44:24.355
Baby, I'm so sorry.

44:25.302 --> 44:27.942
So everything he ever said...

44:28.126 --> 44:29.673
I know.

44:29.716 --> 44:31.095
I know.

44:31.152 --> 44:33.698
Just read it, you can see.

44:33.727 --> 44:35.539
I begged him not to
go through with it.

44:35.540 --> 44:38.860
- You agreed to help him.
- I didn't want to, baby.

44:39.314 --> 44:42.347
He would've gone and
done this anyway.

44:42.348 --> 44:45.578
At least this way, I felt
that you would be protected.

44:45.579 --> 44:49.409
You know that is an eternal
death sentence in his book.

44:51.509 --> 44:54.547
This is just such a lie.

44:57.066 --> 44:59.496
What are you gonna do, Sophia?

45:00.573 --> 45:02.499
I'm gonna go to his funeral.

45:02.500 --> 45:05.139
And I'm gonna speak
like I said I would.

46:57.216 --> 46:59.211
Is someone here?

47:14.812 --> 47:16.387
Hello?

48:25.235 --> 48:27.062
- Hey.
- Hey.

48:31.547 --> 48:32.320
Let me see it.

48:32.321 --> 48:35.086
Come on, this doesn't
have to be a big deal.

48:35.087 --> 48:37.026
Come on, let me see it.

48:37.475 --> 48:40.834
Alright, it's not
as bad as it looks.

48:40.892 --> 48:43.651
Yeah well, you said there's a
piece of glass in it, so...

48:43.652 --> 48:46.723
Yeah, this one.

48:48.534 --> 48:50.215
- Ouch.
- Sorry.

48:50.216 --> 48:51.882
It's okay.

48:53.382 --> 48:55.296
Where was Sam?

48:55.311 --> 48:57.405
He was sleeping.

48:58.156 --> 49:00.663
It doesn't have to be a big thing.

49:01.966 --> 49:03.660
This might burn.

49:03.872 --> 49:06.386
That's never what a
girl wants to hear.

49:06.437 --> 49:08.075
Astrid...

49:10.890 --> 49:13.376
Ignore her.

49:15.472 --> 49:17.907
- Is that alright?
- It's okay.

49:19.133 --> 49:21.100
How this happened again?

49:22.683 --> 49:26.962
I broke some glass, so maybe I
touched a piece with my finger and...

49:26.963 --> 49:29.534
- I don't know, scratch my chest.
- Yeah.

49:29.535 --> 49:31.669
How did you break the glass?

49:31.804 --> 49:34.713
A picture fell while I
was in the other room.

49:34.771 --> 49:37.473
How did it fall? By itself?

49:37.640 --> 49:40.189
Maybe I set it down too
close to the edge.

49:40.512 --> 49:42.269
It just fell?

49:44.944 --> 49:46.393
Hey...

49:47.529 --> 49:49.802
Don't worry. I'm fine.

49:49.803 --> 49:51.398
Yeah?

49:52.106 --> 49:54.362
I think you should
stay here tonight.

49:57.425 --> 50:00.063
I'll sleep on the couch.

50:06.553 --> 50:07.918
Okay.

51:36.138 --> 51:37.329
Wait.

51:40.200 --> 51:41.514
What?

51:43.245 --> 51:45.954
What happens if I fall
in love with you?

51:50.237 --> 51:51.843
Everything.

53:43.532 --> 53:44.746
Adam?

53:54.362 --> 53:55.709
Adam?

54:12.586 --> 54:13.998
Adam?

54:14.866 --> 54:16.246
Adam?

54:19.599 --> 54:20.984
What's going on?

54:20.985 --> 54:23.579
I can't find him,
and there's blood...

54:31.887 --> 54:33.693
Is that his blood?

54:33.971 --> 54:36.323
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

54:38.446 --> 54:39.803
Oh my God.

54:39.804 --> 54:42.336
Do you have your phone?
Call the police.

54:43.628 --> 54:45.138
I'm gonna call him first.

54:45.139 --> 54:47.418
You never know, maybe he's...

54:54.532 --> 54:56.707
Call the police, Astrid.

55:02.256 --> 55:03.581
Shit.

55:04.393 --> 55:06.594
Fucking hold!

55:07.967 --> 55:09.960
What are you doing?

55:10.027 --> 55:11.776
Sophia?

55:20.648 --> 55:21.735
Sophia...

55:21.736 --> 55:23.519
Stop, seriously.

55:23.520 --> 55:25.212
Can you get through?

55:52.170 --> 55:53.979
Oh my God.

55:55.934 --> 55:57.618
Wait, are you still on hold?

55:57.619 --> 55:58.693
Yes.

55:58.694 --> 56:00.987
We should go back and wait.

56:02.503 --> 56:03.925
What are you doing?

56:10.215 --> 56:11.828
Yes hi, hello.

56:11.829 --> 56:14.210
I live in the Walden Tower,
16th and Harper...

56:14.211 --> 56:18.131
Apartment 2112, my roommate has gone
missing and there's blood on his bed.

56:18.222 --> 56:21.275
No, we found him gone.

56:21.701 --> 56:24.904
His girlfriend was in bed with him,
she's here with me now.

56:29.024 --> 56:31.188
No, there's blood everywhere.

56:31.189 --> 56:33.523
We think he was taken
to the top floor.

56:33.524 --> 56:35.245
Hello?

56:35.246 --> 56:36.513
Hello?

56:36.514 --> 56:38.819
Okay, we should...

56:38.820 --> 56:40.630
We should stop and wait.

56:40.631 --> 56:41.811
No.

56:41.812 --> 56:44.133
We can't just go up there, Sophia.

56:44.134 --> 56:45.717
Why not?

56:45.718 --> 56:47.829
Someone came into our
apartment and took him.

56:47.830 --> 56:50.085
We don't know that.

57:11.117 --> 57:13.065
We should go back.

57:35.607 --> 57:37.543
Oh my God.

57:38.654 --> 57:41.433
No, no Sophia,
someone else is in there.

57:41.434 --> 57:43.339
We have to go please,
we have to go.

57:43.340 --> 57:45.795
Come on, come on.

57:55.157 --> 57:57.798
And the last time you saw him
was around 11 pm, correct?

57:57.799 --> 57:59.276
Yes.

57:59.396 --> 58:00.843
We went to sleep together.

58:00.844 --> 58:04.131
Okay, after you realized he was missing,
how long before you called 911?

58:04.132 --> 58:05.677
I called, actually.

58:05.678 --> 58:08.504
I heard Sophia yelling for Adam,
that woke me up.

58:08.505 --> 58:09.827
I called a few minutes after that.

58:09.828 --> 58:11.374
And how much blood did you see?

58:11.375 --> 58:13.424
There was some on the sheets and...

58:13.425 --> 58:16.097
Kind of a trail
leading to the door.

58:16.098 --> 58:17.877
You should look upstairs too.

58:17.878 --> 58:19.906
We are, we got men up there now.

58:19.907 --> 58:21.794
And did you see the blood as well?

58:21.886 --> 58:24.574
- Yes.
- And how much blood did you see?

58:25.512 --> 58:27.482
The same amount that she did.

58:27.613 --> 58:29.677
Did you guys even look in there?

58:29.678 --> 58:31.807
Yeah, I've looked.

58:31.808 --> 58:33.384
We've looked all over.

58:33.385 --> 58:34.527
Okay.

58:34.528 --> 58:36.421
We scouted the entire apartment.

58:36.422 --> 58:38.595
We checked all of it,
there's no blood anywhere.

58:38.596 --> 58:41.177
What do you mean?
Of course there is.

58:41.662 --> 58:44.454
There was blood all
over here, and on the...

58:45.706 --> 58:47.651
On the door.

58:54.773 --> 58:56.144
There was blood here.

58:56.145 --> 58:58.253
Excuse me, Officer Sowman.

58:58.384 --> 58:59.710
Can I have a word?

58:59.809 --> 59:01.991
Give me a sec, ladies.

59:03.450 --> 59:06.439
Did we leave the door
unlocked when we went up?

59:07.899 --> 59:09.691
I don't know.

59:15.274 --> 59:18.957
Well, we did a thorough check of the
elevator and all of this area...

59:18.958 --> 59:20.797
It's completely vacant.

59:20.798 --> 59:23.618
Nothing suspicious,
no signs of force entry.

59:23.974 --> 59:25.724
Do you ladies...

59:25.725 --> 59:27.327
Drink any alcohol tonight?

59:27.328 --> 59:29.151
You can't be serious.

59:29.152 --> 59:31.276
On any kind of
medication or anything?

59:31.277 --> 59:32.872
No.

59:32.975 --> 59:34.357
Okay.

59:34.565 --> 59:36.227
These things often happen.

59:36.228 --> 59:38.116
Someone gets up in the
middle of the night...

59:38.117 --> 59:39.470
Doesn't tell anybody.

59:39.471 --> 59:41.192
They usually turns out
to be nothing in the end.

59:41.193 --> 59:44.064
- No.
- He was bleeding, officer.

59:44.065 --> 59:46.147
- How long have you known him?
- Long enough.

59:46.148 --> 59:49.195
You're not listening,
we both saw his blood.

59:49.196 --> 59:51.204
You can't tell us that
we didn't see it.

59:51.205 --> 59:54.056
- I understand that.
- Then do something!

59:54.057 --> 59:56.410
I've got zero evidence
and nothing to go on.

59:56.411 --> 59:58.834
You can't be fucking serious.

59:58.835 --> 01:00:01.776
Listen, why don't you
just get some rest, okay?

01:00:01.777 --> 01:00:03.432
I'm sure he'll be fine.

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:06.606
If he doesn't come up in the
morning, come and file a report.

01:00:07.175 --> 01:00:08.697
Wait, that's it?

01:00:08.698 --> 01:00:11.552
Until he's gone 24 hours,
nothing else I can do.

01:00:11.757 --> 01:00:14.225
This thing has a way of
working themselves out.

01:00:14.279 --> 01:00:16.030
I'm sure he'll be okay. Ready?

01:00:16.031 --> 01:00:17.748
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

01:00:26.076 --> 01:00:28.331
I don't want anything
to do with this.

01:00:28.634 --> 01:00:30.713
Besides I don't have any keys.

01:00:30.714 --> 01:00:32.570
So I can't help you.

01:00:32.792 --> 01:00:35.249
But isn't that part of your job?

01:00:36.939 --> 01:00:38.487
It's not.

01:00:38.705 --> 01:00:41.583
We're really worried about him.

01:00:41.668 --> 01:00:44.013
Anything you could
tell us will help.

01:00:44.014 --> 01:00:46.492
I can tell you not to go up there.

01:00:47.103 --> 01:00:48.831
Call the police.

01:00:48.832 --> 01:00:50.463
I'm not a detective.

01:00:50.464 --> 01:00:53.570
We did call the police, they don't
want to come until tomorrow.

01:00:53.571 --> 01:00:55.873
- How long have you lived here?
- A year.

01:00:55.874 --> 01:00:57.610
A year?

01:00:57.731 --> 01:01:00.438
And you haven't heard about
what goes on up there?

01:01:00.439 --> 01:01:02.386
What's up there?

01:01:02.387 --> 01:01:05.287
- It's infested.
- With what?

01:01:05.488 --> 01:01:07.708
People came to die here.

01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:10.054
For over a half century.

01:01:10.759 --> 01:01:12.572
What do you think?

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:14.695
I went up there once.

01:01:14.696 --> 01:01:17.421
When I first got here,
about 30 years ago.

01:01:17.422 --> 01:01:18.991
And?

01:01:18.992 --> 01:01:21.036
I'm not going up again.

01:01:22.411 --> 01:01:24.119
Look, Mr Carter...

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:26.953
All these ghosts stories aside...

01:01:26.954 --> 01:01:30.680
Don't you think that maybe there's
just a couple of vagrants up there?

01:01:31.171 --> 01:01:35.187
I can't imagine anything last
more than 5 minutes up there.

01:01:36.575 --> 01:01:39.353
Top floor is where
they all came to die.

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:53.066
This woman, supposedly was in charged
up there, lived up there for years.

01:01:53.349 --> 01:01:57.215
They said she used
to steal patient's.

01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:59.792
Put their all belonging in a box.

01:01:59.793 --> 01:02:02.300
And do God knows what with them.

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:06.433
Said she was...

01:02:06.434 --> 01:02:08.233
Trying to help them.

01:02:08.688 --> 01:02:10.616
Pass on.

01:02:12.803 --> 01:02:14.700
Ladies.

01:02:15.145 --> 01:02:17.827
This building has an ugly history.

01:02:19.804 --> 01:02:21.232
Just...

01:02:21.233 --> 01:02:23.136
Wait for the police.

01:02:38.032 --> 01:02:40.881
How do you do this?

01:02:43.549 --> 01:02:45.964
It takes a little patience.

01:02:50.897 --> 01:02:52.872
Why did you stop?

01:02:55.332 --> 01:02:56.858
I don't know.

01:02:57.749 --> 01:02:59.319
Yeah you do.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:07.070
I think maybe I lost sight
of the beauty around me.

01:03:07.323 --> 01:03:10.004
I just didn't feel it anymore.

01:03:16.113 --> 01:03:19.201
It keeps coming back to the water.

01:03:25.618 --> 01:03:30.912
My dad used to say that the ocean is the
closest we'll ever get on this earth to God.

01:03:38.399 --> 01:03:41.537
I think maybe it's just
the shared magnitude of...

01:03:46.453 --> 01:03:50.267
I used to go there after my mom
died and tried to capture it.

01:03:50.401 --> 01:03:52.235
Maybe I could...

01:03:52.556 --> 01:03:56.253
Experience something
she was experiencing.

01:03:59.492 --> 01:04:02.124
I want to take you to the ocean.

01:04:08.205 --> 01:04:09.870
Who are you again?

01:04:11.882 --> 01:04:13.576
I'm Adam.

01:04:15.756 --> 01:04:17.821
You can call me Biff.

01:04:18.047 --> 01:04:19.773
All the ladies call me Biff.

01:04:22.675 --> 01:04:24.628
You better not let go.

01:04:25.930 --> 01:04:27.631
I won't.

01:04:28.719 --> 01:04:30.462
Promise?

01:04:41.744 --> 01:04:43.613
I promise.

01:04:52.519 --> 01:04:54.928
Your friends supposed
to be here an hour ago.

01:04:58.757 --> 01:05:00.522
Mr Carter's crazy.

01:05:00.523 --> 01:05:02.665
You got that too, right?

01:05:08.556 --> 01:05:12.106
- You're late.
- Nice to meet you too.

01:05:13.021 --> 01:05:15.682
I thought you were
bringing another guy.

01:05:16.026 --> 01:05:18.373
Hi, I'm Penny.

01:05:18.374 --> 01:05:22.727
- Hey.
- I'm sure it'll be fine, there are 4 of us.

01:05:22.728 --> 01:05:24.427
It's gonna be alright.

01:05:24.428 --> 01:05:27.921
Sam told me about what happened.
I think it's awful.

01:05:27.929 --> 01:05:30.413
- But I can help you guys look.
- Thanks.

01:05:30.414 --> 01:05:32.823
Sophia, who's to say...

01:05:32.824 --> 01:05:34.785
This guy didn't just skip town.

01:05:34.786 --> 01:05:37.356
Maybe he wants you to believe
something happened to him.

01:05:37.357 --> 01:05:39.305
That's not what happened, Sam.

01:05:39.306 --> 01:05:41.127
I'm just saying.

01:05:41.128 --> 01:05:45.462
Why don't the 4 of us go grab some
drinks, see how this thing pans out...

01:05:45.463 --> 01:05:48.374
He's gonna come running
back in a few days.

01:05:48.375 --> 01:05:51.373
Look, if we just go up there
and look around, we'll find him.

01:05:51.374 --> 01:05:52.687
Okay? I promise.

01:05:52.688 --> 01:05:54.963
Are you sure we need
all this stuff?

01:05:55.203 --> 01:05:57.624
- Yes.
- Alright then.

01:06:34.582 --> 01:06:35.965
Is that normal?

01:06:35.966 --> 01:06:38.464
It's not usually that bad.

01:06:47.082 --> 01:06:48.930
What is happening?

01:06:48.931 --> 01:06:50.695
I don't know.

01:06:59.911 --> 01:07:01.465
Okay.

01:07:11.329 --> 01:07:13.675
What the hell was that?

01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:17.430
I don't know, it's a
really old building.

01:07:43.834 --> 01:07:45.591
Hello?

01:07:47.022 --> 01:07:49.318
Anybody here?

01:08:01.418 --> 01:08:03.303
Should we even be here?

01:08:03.304 --> 01:08:06.816
You guys said the police investigate
this entire floor right?

01:08:07.245 --> 01:08:09.184
So, we'll be fine.

01:08:14.935 --> 01:08:18.051
Alright, let's go down here.

01:08:20.216 --> 01:08:24.740
Penny, wait here. Tell me if you see
anything. I'm gonna check this room out.

01:08:26.055 --> 01:08:28.582
Great, thanks.

01:09:25.493 --> 01:09:26.962
Sam?

01:09:29.938 --> 01:09:32.156
Sam, I'm gonna go, okay?

01:09:35.526 --> 01:09:36.756
Sam?

01:09:39.832 --> 01:09:41.366
Are you okay?

01:09:41.381 --> 01:09:44.582
No, I don't want to be
here anymore. Okay?

01:09:44.582 --> 01:09:46.392
You said we'd be doing
something fun tonight.

01:09:46.393 --> 01:09:48.170
And we are not doing
something fun right now.

01:09:48.171 --> 01:09:51.624
We're fine, relax.
There's nobody up here.

01:09:51.848 --> 01:09:55.894
Sophia's freaking out. We need to stick
around to make sure she's okay, alright?

01:09:55.895 --> 01:09:58.836
I'll make it up to you,
10 more minutes. Listen...

01:09:58.837 --> 01:10:00.223
You're not gonna believe this.

01:10:00.224 --> 01:10:03.397
Some classic originals
are in this room.

01:10:13.594 --> 01:10:15.392
Look at this.

01:10:30.306 --> 01:10:34.066
What the hell is that?

01:11:25.548 --> 01:11:27.642
It's just a record player.

01:11:31.995 --> 01:11:35.392
I think we should look somewhere else.
We didn't find anything here.

01:12:07.481 --> 01:12:10.372
We need to go down.
Yeah, I'm with Sam on this.

01:12:10.373 --> 01:12:12.308
- Let's just look somewhere else.
- No.

01:12:12.309 --> 01:12:14.858
- We need to go down.
- Wait, just wait a second.

01:12:14.859 --> 01:12:16.494
We haven't even seen anything yet.

01:12:16.495 --> 01:12:19.646
Sophia, we shouldn't be up
here, this shit is not normal.

01:12:19.945 --> 01:12:21.918
Come on, we're leaving.

01:12:26.605 --> 01:12:28.187
Sophia.

01:12:30.563 --> 01:12:32.195
Okay.

01:12:35.699 --> 01:12:36.845
Wait.

01:12:36.846 --> 01:12:38.267
Wait.

01:12:38.268 --> 01:12:39.856
Listen.

01:12:39.857 --> 01:12:41.982
That sounds like Adam.

01:12:43.202 --> 01:12:46.017
That's him, he's up here.

01:12:56.455 --> 01:12:58.507
Where's it coming from? Here?

01:13:02.242 --> 01:13:04.274
What is this place?

01:13:16.266 --> 01:13:17.658
Come on.

01:13:34.828 --> 01:13:36.172
You see that?

01:13:36.173 --> 01:13:37.348
No.

01:13:38.456 --> 01:13:41.082
- Something's there.
- Is that him?

01:13:42.808 --> 01:13:44.446
Wait.

01:14:02.372 --> 01:14:05.356
What do you see?

01:14:08.432 --> 01:14:10.196
Penny!

01:14:10.513 --> 01:14:12.053
Penny!

01:14:12.054 --> 01:14:13.718
Stop!

01:14:28.509 --> 01:14:30.267
Penny!

01:14:30.723 --> 01:14:33.461
Sam, where are you?

01:14:34.890 --> 01:14:36.275
Penny!

01:14:36.276 --> 01:14:39.252
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

01:14:39.531 --> 01:14:42.095
Sam, what happened?

01:14:42.096 --> 01:14:44.996
- Oh my God.
- We're gonna get you out.

01:14:44.997 --> 01:14:46.642
Shit.

01:14:49.452 --> 01:14:50.688
Are you okay?

01:14:50.689 --> 01:14:53.818
I'm okay. Penny, come on.

01:14:53.833 --> 01:14:56.240
Guys, we need to get out of here.

01:14:56.241 --> 01:14:58.293
- Pull down one of the drapes.
- Okay, wait.

01:14:58.294 --> 01:15:00.562
Come on, quickly.

01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:15.925
Alright, I've got it. Now pull.

01:15:20.686 --> 01:15:24.536
I've got a good foot hold.
Keep pulling.

01:15:33.935 --> 01:15:35.584
Penny!

01:15:37.504 --> 01:15:38.911
Penny.

01:15:47.789 --> 01:15:49.357
Shit.

01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:51.417
Run!

01:16:01.911 --> 01:16:04.831
It's not lighting up.

01:16:05.042 --> 01:16:08.179
- Shit!
- I don't hear anything in here.

01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:09.332
Stairs, where's the stairs?

01:16:09.333 --> 01:16:11.574
I don't think there are
stairs in this building.

01:16:11.575 --> 01:16:12.783
What?

01:16:12.784 --> 01:16:15.254
The landlord told us when we
moved in. There's no stairs.

01:16:15.255 --> 01:16:18.585
There's stairs in every building,
we're just have to find them.

01:16:18.901 --> 01:16:21.044
Okay, I'll help you carry Penny.

01:16:21.045 --> 01:16:22.543
Wait, wait.

01:16:22.646 --> 01:16:25.335
I'll come back for her when we find
the stairs. It'll be faster that way.

01:16:25.336 --> 01:16:28.913
Okay, let's check the far corners of
the building. That would be our best bet.

01:16:31.009 --> 01:16:34.509
Do you really think there's gonna
be stairs at the end of this?

01:16:34.539 --> 01:16:37.907
This building's gotta end somewhere.
It's worth looking.

01:16:39.714 --> 01:16:41.598
Wait, did you hear that?

01:16:41.599 --> 01:16:43.153
Yeah.

01:16:48.559 --> 01:16:50.584
Wait, hold on.

01:16:56.894 --> 01:16:58.259
What are you doing?

01:16:58.260 --> 01:17:00.394
My flashlight keeps going out.

01:17:00.395 --> 01:17:02.627
I'm just trying to get some light.

01:17:18.747 --> 01:17:20.939
Come up here, walk with me.

01:17:29.157 --> 01:17:32.629
- Do you know where the fire escape is?
- I have no idea.

01:17:39.326 --> 01:17:42.211
Sophia, run!

01:17:43.298 --> 01:17:44.918
Sam!

01:17:54.041 --> 01:17:55.685
Let me out!

01:17:55.686 --> 01:17:58.417
Sophia, help me!

01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:03.133
Astrid, pull!

01:18:03.134 --> 01:18:04.992
No!

01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:07.977
It's not moving!

01:18:07.978 --> 01:18:10.121
Sophia!

01:18:19.676 --> 01:18:21.531
Astrid!

01:18:23.704 --> 01:18:25.023
Okay.

01:18:25.773 --> 01:18:27.762
I'm gonna go find another door.

01:18:27.763 --> 01:18:31.070
Please, no! No!

01:18:31.071 --> 01:18:33.578
Sophia!

01:19:25.549 --> 01:19:27.159
Hello?

01:19:37.627 --> 01:19:39.363
Who are you?

01:19:39.710 --> 01:19:41.748
Just an old man...

01:19:41.749 --> 01:19:44.814
Forgotten up here with
the rest of them.

01:19:45.354 --> 01:19:47.141
Someone else is up here.

01:19:47.775 --> 01:19:49.807
Oh, yes, there is.

01:19:50.150 --> 01:19:54.180
You must not be able to see
them all yet, but... you will

01:19:54.515 --> 01:19:56.148
What do you mean?

01:19:58.975 --> 01:20:00.230
It's ok.

01:20:01.077 --> 01:20:05.278
They don't care about you
and you can't help them.

01:20:05.678 --> 01:20:06.965
What is this?

01:20:07.206 --> 01:20:10.511
It's what none of you
can normally see.

01:20:11.344 --> 01:20:12.840
We're everywhere.

01:20:13.293 --> 01:20:16.268
Like... oxygen in the darkness.

01:20:17.249 --> 01:20:21.777
We're crawling the walls into the
empty spaces of your houses.

01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:26.342
Most of us, we won't survive.
Just like you.

01:20:27.383 --> 01:20:31.979
Normally when you hear a
whisper, we're screaming.

01:20:33.021 --> 01:20:36.886
When you hear a tap, or a pound.

01:20:38.184 --> 01:20:41.876
If you're here seeing me...

01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:48.087
someone around you is passing.

01:20:48.516 --> 01:20:52.811
Dying. And holding
on very tightly.

01:20:53.184 --> 01:20:55.708
Is it someone close to you?

01:20:55.709 --> 01:20:58.208
You should let him go.

01:20:58.756 --> 01:21:00.490
I can't.

01:21:00.491 --> 01:21:03.474
Chances are he's too far
gone to bring back.

01:21:03.475 --> 01:21:05.562
But I heard him scream.

01:21:05.563 --> 01:21:07.729
I know he's alive.

01:21:07.730 --> 01:21:10.047
Even though he's holding on...

01:21:10.048 --> 01:21:12.780
He would be gone soon.

01:21:13.151 --> 01:21:16.054
And all of this,
will be gone with him.

01:21:17.578 --> 01:21:19.811
You don't believe me.

01:21:20.756 --> 01:21:24.724
A window opens when you die.

01:21:24.725 --> 01:21:27.253
Between here and there.

01:21:27.695 --> 01:21:30.693
And in an infested
place like this...

01:21:30.694 --> 01:21:33.632
The beasts are running free.

01:21:34.577 --> 01:21:40.438
Just because you're so desperately
want none of this to exist...

01:21:40.782 --> 01:21:43.894
You can't change the
fact that it does.

01:21:43.895 --> 01:21:46.988
And that we are all around you.

01:21:46.989 --> 01:21:49.105
Always.

01:21:49.106 --> 01:21:53.147
You never find him if you
don't believe where he is.

01:21:53.148 --> 01:21:55.884
Maybe that's a good thing.
Because...

01:21:55.885 --> 01:21:59.600
They won't stop until
he's completely gone.

01:21:59.601 --> 01:22:01.066
Who?

01:22:01.067 --> 01:22:02.545
Them.

01:22:02.546 --> 01:22:05.587
The demons and the dead.

01:22:05.596 --> 01:22:10.341
There's a world out here,
constantly peddling.

01:22:10.342 --> 01:22:12.906
If you keep looking for him...

01:22:12.907 --> 01:22:16.106
They might take you too.

01:22:16.221 --> 01:22:19.701
But if this is real,
then why are you here?

01:22:19.702 --> 01:22:23.774
Why aren't you in
some better place?

01:22:23.792 --> 01:22:27.108
Too much pain to leave just yet.

01:22:28.265 --> 01:22:30.321
You'll find nothing but...

01:22:30.322 --> 01:22:32.804
Tortured souls here.

01:22:32.805 --> 01:22:36.199
The ones at peace had gone.

01:22:36.225 --> 01:22:38.785
Why did they take him from me?

01:22:38.786 --> 01:22:43.662
He must've opened himself to
them or chose to let them in.

01:22:43.663 --> 01:22:45.741
He wouldn't do that.

01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:48.385
You'd be surprised.

01:22:48.386 --> 01:22:52.746
They'll crawled into any
opening they can find.

01:22:52.861 --> 01:22:55.918
How am I supposed to
believe any of this?

01:22:55.919 --> 01:22:58.995
Not only are you going to
have to believe it's real...

01:22:58.996 --> 01:23:03.414
But you must throw yourself
in the middle of it.

01:23:05.645 --> 01:23:09.264
You want to find him
and bring him back?

01:23:09.326 --> 01:23:13.754
Then you're going to
have to join him first.

01:24:12.687 --> 01:24:14.355
Hello?

01:24:17.807 --> 01:24:19.492
Hello?

01:24:47.852 --> 01:24:49.741
Can you hear me?

01:26:04.061 --> 01:26:05.866
Are you okay?

01:26:05.867 --> 01:26:07.669
I'm fine.

01:26:07.670 --> 01:26:11.060
- But I heard screaming.
- It wasn't me.

01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:15.636
Did you find anything?

01:26:15.866 --> 01:26:17.976
No, nothing.

01:26:18.399 --> 01:26:19.993
Come with me.

01:26:19.994 --> 01:26:21.423
Where?

01:26:21.424 --> 01:26:23.263
Just come.

01:26:35.498 --> 01:26:37.519
This should work.

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:39.665
Why are we stopping?

01:26:39.899 --> 01:26:44.083
Look at you, sweetheart.
You have to sit down for a second.

01:26:44.154 --> 01:26:46.920
We've been at this for hours.

01:26:46.929 --> 01:26:51.536
There's no way we're gonna find Adam
if we don't rest and catch our breath.

01:26:54.278 --> 01:26:57.641
Lie down. Just for a minute.

01:27:02.126 --> 01:27:04.191
Come on.

01:27:04.659 --> 01:27:06.600
Okay.

01:27:21.252 --> 01:27:23.696
Where did you get this necklace?

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:26.044
My dad.

01:27:26.597 --> 01:27:30.291
It's funny cause I had a charm
bracelet that matches it...

01:27:30.292 --> 01:27:33.041
I lost it the last time I was here.

01:27:33.394 --> 01:27:35.539
Maybe my couch ate it.

01:27:35.865 --> 01:27:38.195
I'll look for it tomorrow.

01:27:38.698 --> 01:27:42.790
You know what they say about people
whose stuff goes missing around here...

01:27:42.791 --> 01:27:43.655
Stop it.

01:27:43.656 --> 01:27:47.313
I don't know, I thought
you didn't believe in it.

01:27:47.395 --> 01:27:50.105
So? It's creepy.

01:27:51.676 --> 01:27:55.790
You don't think that crazy lady under the
bed has anything to do with it, do you?

01:27:55.791 --> 01:27:58.857
I'm seriously never
staying here again.

01:27:58.858 --> 01:28:01.419
What? I don't think so.

01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:03.693
You're not going anywhere.

01:28:03.694 --> 01:28:06.773
I'm not gonna let any crazy
lady steal your stuff.

01:28:06.774 --> 01:28:11.162
Good, cause I don't want to die
in despair and into nothingness.

01:28:12.521 --> 01:28:15.353
You think I'm weird, don't you?

01:28:16.562 --> 01:28:19.131
I do think that.

01:28:19.837 --> 01:28:23.115
Does it freak you out that
I'm always dreading death?

01:28:23.116 --> 01:28:25.074
I just think...

01:28:25.075 --> 01:28:27.762
You think there's nothing,
but maybe...

01:28:29.469 --> 01:28:32.118
Maybe there's something.

01:28:44.210 --> 01:28:46.301
What are you doing?

01:28:48.756 --> 01:28:50.830
I didn't want to wake you.

01:28:53.533 --> 01:28:55.984
There's hot water in here.

01:28:57.019 --> 01:28:59.466
I just felt so disgusting.

01:29:00.317 --> 01:29:03.229
I haven't felt clean in so long.

01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:08.788
Where's my necklace?

01:29:09.370 --> 01:29:12.618
Wait, how long have I been asleep?

01:29:13.971 --> 01:29:16.115
15 minutes.

01:29:16.712 --> 01:29:18.989
He's not up here, Sophia.

01:29:19.310 --> 01:29:22.832
- I think it's time we stop looking.
- I heard him.

01:29:23.789 --> 01:29:26.088
What's wrong with you?

01:29:26.757 --> 01:29:29.175
I think you need some more sleep.

01:29:29.525 --> 01:29:31.209
What?

01:29:31.666 --> 01:29:33.310
You're not thinking clearly.

01:29:33.311 --> 01:29:36.174
I can't just leave you here.
Get up!

01:29:37.410 --> 01:29:39.878
I've seen the way you look at me.

01:29:40.856 --> 01:29:43.056
You're intimidated.

01:29:43.208 --> 01:29:45.422
I know.

01:29:45.941 --> 01:29:48.219
But listen to me, Sophia.

01:29:48.806 --> 01:29:51.916
There's a chance Adam
didn't want you to find him.

01:29:52.675 --> 01:29:55.420
You're a little too
damaged for him.

01:29:55.421 --> 01:29:58.122
I think he figured that out.

01:29:58.882 --> 01:30:01.373
You shouldn't even
be up here, Sophia.

01:30:01.374 --> 01:30:03.320
Did you think of that?

01:30:03.472 --> 01:30:05.494
What are you doing?

01:30:06.062 --> 01:30:08.221
Just trying to be your friend.

01:30:08.222 --> 01:30:10.559
You deserve honesty.

01:30:11.933 --> 01:30:14.218
You're not my friend.

01:31:11.854 --> 01:31:14.555
It was supposed to be me.

01:31:19.629 --> 01:31:22.568
Adam, where are you?

01:31:35.181 --> 01:31:37.759
Where are you?

01:31:43.735 --> 01:31:46.286
Where are you?

01:31:58.423 --> 01:32:00.676
Sophia...

01:32:01.171 --> 01:32:03.307
Adam?

01:32:08.345 --> 01:32:10.274
Found what you're looking for?

01:32:10.275 --> 01:32:12.620
They came for me, not Adam.

01:32:13.494 --> 01:32:15.065
You don't know that.

01:32:15.066 --> 01:32:17.793
These are my things
that have been missing.

01:32:17.970 --> 01:32:20.196
He's up here.

01:32:20.197 --> 01:32:22.390
I just have to revive him.

01:32:22.391 --> 01:32:24.773
You can't. You have to
find his body first.

01:32:24.774 --> 01:32:26.713
I know how to find him.

01:32:26.714 --> 01:32:28.090
What do you mean?

01:32:28.091 --> 01:32:29.974
I have to join him.

01:32:29.975 --> 01:32:31.762
You have to what?

01:32:31.763 --> 01:32:33.820
Do you know CPR?

01:32:33.821 --> 01:32:36.212
- Why?
- Do you or not?

01:32:36.213 --> 01:32:39.005
Yes I know CPR, Sophia. Why?

01:32:39.418 --> 01:32:41.828
Because I need you to kill me.

01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:47.583
Okay.

01:32:47.584 --> 01:32:49.584
It's pretty cold now.

01:32:49.585 --> 01:32:51.741
This isn't going to work.

01:32:51.742 --> 01:32:53.539
It could.

01:32:53.540 --> 01:32:55.357
You don't even know he's dead.

01:32:55.358 --> 01:32:59.272
He was screaming before.
And I just heard him whisper.

01:32:59.362 --> 01:33:02.208
Do you really think he
would do this for you?

01:33:02.209 --> 01:33:04.393
He already did.

01:33:05.532 --> 01:33:09.615
You're gonna have to hold me
down no matter how hard I fight.

01:33:09.616 --> 01:33:11.751
- Yes.
- Okay.

01:33:11.752 --> 01:33:14.094
I can find him out there.

01:33:14.095 --> 01:33:16.822
Then we just have to go straight
to his body and revive him.

01:33:16.823 --> 01:33:19.006
Let me see your watch.

01:33:20.493 --> 01:33:22.108
Alright.

01:33:22.206 --> 01:33:24.858
Once I stop moving,
pull me out of the water.

01:33:24.859 --> 01:33:28.611
I can last about 6 minutes
without any permanent damage.

01:33:28.612 --> 01:33:30.765
All I need is 3 minutes.

01:33:30.766 --> 01:33:33.756
After 3 minutes, start CPR.

01:33:33.757 --> 01:33:37.782
Whatever you do,
don't let this get to 6.

01:33:38.074 --> 01:33:41.101
All I need you to do
is bring me back.

01:35:01.641 --> 01:35:03.318
Sophia!

01:35:06.324 --> 01:35:07.983
Penny.

01:35:11.681 --> 01:35:14.117
Penny, I'm so sorry.

01:35:25.223 --> 01:35:27.303
It's okay.

01:35:32.693 --> 01:35:34.766
It's okay.

01:35:41.116 --> 01:35:44.015
Sophia! Astrid!

01:35:44.016 --> 01:35:45.803
Wait...

01:36:18.503 --> 01:36:21.508
Sophia!

01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:32.274
No, no...

01:36:32.275 --> 01:36:35.236
Don't leave me. Please!

01:38:15.282 --> 01:38:17.584
Sophia!

01:39:41.704 --> 01:39:45.038
Sophia? Astrid?

01:39:46.139 --> 01:39:49.188
Oh God, I thought it was over.
Did you see the...

01:39:49.189 --> 01:39:51.709
What the fuck is going on?

01:39:52.418 --> 01:39:54.889
How long has she been under?

01:39:56.637 --> 01:39:58.593
Sophia.

01:39:58.594 --> 01:40:01.592
She's not breathing. Astrid!

01:41:11.078 --> 01:41:12.880
Sophia!

01:41:13.178 --> 01:41:15.217
Adam!

01:41:20.485 --> 01:41:23.526
Sophia!

01:41:25.665 --> 01:41:27.512
Adam!

01:41:35.879 --> 01:41:39.258
Fuck... What?

01:41:41.479 --> 01:41:43.365
Come on!

01:41:50.267 --> 01:41:52.045
You're not giving up, girl.

01:41:52.046 --> 01:41:53.746
You are not giving up!

01:41:53.747 --> 01:41:55.418
Help!

01:41:56.194 --> 01:41:59.293
Adam! Where are you?

01:41:59.294 --> 01:42:01.121
Adam?

01:42:02.778 --> 01:42:05.156
That's it. Come on.

01:42:05.905 --> 01:42:09.701
Stay with me. Stay with me.

01:42:10.132 --> 01:42:12.393
Come on, come back.

01:42:12.394 --> 01:42:15.684
That's it. Sophia, that's it.

01:42:18.756 --> 01:42:21.752
Adam, where are you?

01:42:29.134 --> 01:42:30.989
Sophia.

01:42:33.997 --> 01:42:36.160
You have to go back.

01:42:36.391 --> 01:42:38.133
No.

01:42:38.210 --> 01:42:40.842
Where is your body?

01:42:40.843 --> 01:42:44.276
Tell me. I can find you.

01:42:44.515 --> 01:42:46.878
You have to go.

01:42:51.074 --> 01:42:52.806
Wake up.

01:42:53.599 --> 01:42:57.093
Come on, that's it Sophia.

01:42:58.797 --> 01:43:02.562
You can still make it back, Sophia.

01:43:02.608 --> 01:43:04.293
Please.

01:43:07.119 --> 01:43:10.076
Come back, don't give up.

01:43:17.784 --> 01:43:20.867
Come on! Sophia!

01:43:20.868 --> 01:43:23.273
You have to go back.

01:43:29.099 --> 01:43:32.885
No, Sophia. Come back.

01:44:58.236 --> 01:45:00.823
Sophia!

01:45:17.190 --> 01:45:19.029
Help!

01:46:15.562 --> 01:46:17.402
Why did you do that?

01:46:17.957 --> 01:46:20.246
Because I'm not gonna lose you.

01:46:23.018 --> 01:46:26.544
- They came for me last night.
- I know.

01:46:27.222 --> 01:46:30.410
Then why did you take my place?

01:46:31.372 --> 01:46:33.389
Because I love you.

01:46:46.987 --> 01:46:48.987
What happens now?

01:46:51.471 --> 01:46:53.141
Everything.
