14:00.250 --> 14:04.330
You tell them two
things... you are safe

14:04.330 --> 14:08.410
as long as they do what
we say and no police

14:08.410 --> 14:12.370
enter this building.

14:12.370 --> 14:15.300
Very important.

14:15.300 --> 14:18.770
So everyone make that one
phone call to your family.

14:18.770 --> 14:20.930
Tell them that you
love them as well.

14:20.930 --> 14:22.980
It's Christmas.

14:22.980 --> 14:25.840
Marie, set a good example
and make the first call.

14:25.840 --> 14:26.540
Make the call.

14:26.540 --> 14:28.100
Make the fucking call now!

14:28.100 --> 14:29.360
Make the call!

14:38.680 --> 14:39.380
Yeah, I've gotta go.

14:39.380 --> 14:41.130
Ray, what's the
situation here then?

14:41.130 --> 14:44.000
I take one evening off and the
whole of London goes to shit.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.730
Uh, the men that
shot up Club Q have

14:45.730 --> 14:47.390
entered the underground
car park and seem

14:47.390 --> 14:48.640
to have it locked down.

14:48.640 --> 14:51.390
Well, why would they block
themselves down there?

14:51.390 --> 14:52.460
This is the only exit, right?

14:52.460 --> 14:54.560
Uh, we're... we're trying to get
blueprints of the full layout,

14:54.560 --> 14:55.990
but... but the ones from
the local town hall

14:55.990 --> 14:57.680
were lost in a fire last week.

Wow.

15:08.790 --> 15:11.310
Wow, that was really
heartfelt and emotional.

15:11.310 --> 15:15.730
Each and every one of your phone
calls to your family moved me.

15:15.730 --> 15:16.700
Well done, everyone.

15:16.700 --> 15:19.310
You have done exactly
as we've asked.

15:19.310 --> 15:21.010
Now, just one more thing.

reunite you with the rest

15:23.920 --> 15:28.670
as kind as to follow my handsome

Now fucking move!

15:31.540 --> 15:33.450

Not you, my dear.

15:42.510 --> 15:44.900
You stay with me.

15:44.900 --> 15:47.290
They've taken hostages from
the underground office that

15:47.290 --> 15:48.910
links directly to the car park.

15:48.910 --> 15:52.560
Uh, Emergency Services had a
call from the office workers,

15:52.560 --> 15:54.650
um, but the line went dead
halfway through the call.

15:54.650 --> 15:56.850
What of the teens
kidnapped from the club?

15:56.850 --> 15:59.520
One teen in particular...
Alice Holden.

16:02.810 --> 16:04.860
Prime Minister's daughter's
been kidnapped by terrorists?

16:08.450 --> 16:09.530
Well, has anyone spoken to them?

16:09.530 --> 16:10.400
Do we know what they want?

16:10.400 --> 16:11.950
No contact.

16:11.950 --> 16:13.740
- She's definitely in there?
- Yup.

16:16.700 --> 16:17.750
Right.

16:17.750 --> 16:18.840
OK.

16:18.840 --> 16:21.080
Shut down the street,
wake everyone up.

I want HQ on an open line.

16:23.360 --> 16:26.630
Get a 360 degree cordon
around this place.

16:26.630 --> 16:29.340
No one gets in or out
unless through me.

16:29.340 --> 16:34.580

target with armed security...

Before Action Man here
went to Hollywood... uh,

17:51.880 --> 17:53.470
I mean Hereford.

17:53.470 --> 17:55.610
Yeah, before Detective
Carpenter here got rounded

17:55.610 --> 17:58.270
out for gross insubordination.

17:58.270 --> 18:00.240
I heard you ended
up at Scotland Yard.

18:00.240 --> 18:02.450
So, do we have any
idea why they've

18:02.450 --> 18:04.060
taken her into a car park?

18:04.060 --> 18:06.380
DETECTIVE: This is just a
kidnapping gone wrong, surely.

18:06.380 --> 18:07.950
They just happened
upon this place.

18:07.950 --> 18:11.360
This lot kidnap a prime target,
take care of armed security,

18:11.360 --> 18:13.860
and then they just barricade
themselves in the first place

18:13.860 --> 18:15.610
they come across?

18:15.610 --> 18:18.090
They picked this
place for a reason.

18:18.090 --> 18:19.620
Probably because of
how easily they can

18:19.620 --> 18:21.960
defend themselves down there.

18:21.960 --> 18:23.600
DETECTIVE: There's only
one possible scenario

18:23.600 --> 18:25.690
for a situation like this.

18:25.690 --> 18:26.770
Gas, yeah.

18:26.770 --> 18:28.200
DETECTIVE: Just pump
the gas down the vents

18:28.200 --> 18:29.670
and knock everybody out.

18:29.670 --> 18:32.470
The only problem is... A, they're
wearing masks, which we can't

18:32.470 --> 18:34.790
determine if that's to
protect them from gas, and B,

18:34.790 --> 18:36.660
there's so many of them, all
it takes is for one of them

18:36.660 --> 18:38.800
to see one of the others
drop and they set off what

18:38.800 --> 18:39.800
they got and we lose everyone.

scope for error, does it?

go home to her, OK?

that you hug her so tight,

ever right now, wouldn't that?

to do a few things

20:01.270 --> 20:02.540
for me, just a couple more.

for everything I'm about to do.

a message, the police.

takes to get what he wants.

be fucked with.

25:18.570 --> 25:20.920
You gotta look at me when
I'm talking to you, OK?

25:20.920 --> 25:22.590
It's important.

25:22.590 --> 25:25.830
If we cooperate, Alice,
that won't happen again.

25:25.830 --> 25:26.650
Do you understand?

25:29.830 --> 25:32.510
Like, a... I need, like,
a nod or two blinks

25:32.510 --> 25:34.540
or something that tells me
you understand and you're

25:34.540 --> 25:40.260
gonna cooperate and you're
gonna not be that stubborn girl

25:40.260 --> 25:41.600
you look like you're gonna be.

25:46.890 --> 25:49.260
Get 'em up.
Get up.

25:49.260 --> 25:50.240
Get up.

26:02.980 --> 26:05.320
OK, let's play gain, shall we?

26:05.320 --> 26:09.070
This time, I'm not even
gonna ask them their names.

26:09.070 --> 26:11.840
You just point, Alice, OK?

26:11.840 --> 26:14.880
Which one do you
like least, huh?

26:14.880 --> 26:15.590
Number one?

26:15.590 --> 26:16.540
Bachelor number one?

26:16.540 --> 26:18.880
How do we feel about him?
No?

26:18.880 --> 26:19.890
No, you like him?

26:19.890 --> 26:20.700
I see that.

26:20.700 --> 26:22.650
Number two... OK.

26:22.650 --> 26:24.040
You like him less?

26:24.040 --> 26:25.440
Good.
Three...

26:25.440 --> 26:26.550
- No, no.
- Two...

26:26.550 --> 26:27.720
No!
I'll do whatever you want.

26:27.720 --> 26:28.670
Just let them go.

26:33.920 --> 26:36.820
That a girl.

26:36.820 --> 26:38.890
Come on, Alice.

26:38.890 --> 26:40.000
Let's make you famous.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.670
Get up, now.
Get up.

26:45.030 --> 26:46.820
We need to figure out
a plan of action, Chris.

26:46.820 --> 26:47.990
Working blind down here.

26:47.990 --> 26:50.450
There are 15 floors
and no floor plans.

26:50.450 --> 26:52.820
The whole signal is
fucked in this place.

26:52.820 --> 26:54.430
Mm, that's probably
why they chose it.

26:54.430 --> 26:56.210
Steve?

26:56.210 --> 26:57.110
I've checked the supports.

26:57.110 --> 26:58.330
The whole place is rigged.

26:58.330 --> 26:59.630
It's not something
I want to mess with.

26:59.630 --> 27:00.770
We need the bomb squad.

27:00.770 --> 27:02.540
They'll be in as soon as
they get the shutters up.

27:02.540 --> 27:04.600
Let's just keep our minds
focused on the matter at hand,

27:04.600 --> 27:05.490
shall we, gentlemen?

27:05.490 --> 27:07.970
Mostly likely that Alice is held
hostage on the bottom floor.

27:07.970 --> 27:10.490
Yeah, and the office
workers were on floor five.

27:10.490 --> 27:11.890
There's two stairwells
in this place.

27:11.890 --> 27:13.680
We're gonna split
into two teams.

27:13.680 --> 27:15.130
'Cause you know what?

27:15.130 --> 27:17.210
We sure as shit ain't
getting flanked.

27:17.210 --> 27:19.980
I'm going take team A down
for the office workers.

27:19.980 --> 27:24.320
Clear the offices and rendezvous
with you on floor six.

27:24.320 --> 27:26.860
Remember, we have no idea
whether they have internal

27:26.860 --> 27:28.740
communications,
which means we cannot

27:28.740 --> 27:32.270
afford to get compromised
under any circumstances.

27:32.270 --> 27:35.720
Otherwise, the PM
might have one less kid

27:35.720 --> 27:37.030
around the table for Christmas.

27:37.030 --> 27:40.000
Seven have been harmed...

27:43.750 --> 27:45.440

Please don't.

27:45.440 --> 27:46.430
Listen to me.

27:46.430 --> 27:47.420
I've got money...

27:47.420 --> 27:49.900
I don't want your
fucking money, darling.

27:49.900 --> 27:52.870
They don't want to kill
or hurt any more people.

27:57.610 --> 27:59.100
Stop, stop.
Do me a favour.

27:59.100 --> 27:59.800
Give me five minutes.

27:59.800 --> 28:01.100

As they have shown...

28:01.100 --> 28:02.200
Actually, actually...

they are willing...

and able to...

28:06.230 --> 28:07.220
Look at me.

28:16.650 --> 28:20.000
Detective, is it true the SAS
went in without permission,

28:20.000 --> 28:22.580
fueling the speculation that
the Prime Minister's daughter is

28:22.580 --> 28:23.720
one of the hostages?

28:23.720 --> 28:25.790
CARPENTER (VOICEOVER): I
can neither confirm or deny

28:25.790 --> 28:27.750
that the SAS are involved.

28:27.750 --> 28:30.600
However, we, the police, will
do everything we can to ensure

28:30.600 --> 28:32.090
the safety of any hostages.

28:32.090 --> 28:33.720
Please, don't.

28:33.720 --> 28:37.540
Tell me not to and I'll just
do it even fucking harder.

28:37.540 --> 28:38.990
Please.

28:38.990 --> 28:40.430
Oh god, no!

28:40.430 --> 28:42.360
You're gonna enjoy it, OK?

28:42.360 --> 28:45.250
No one's coming to
help you, and you and I

28:45.250 --> 28:47.240
are gonna have a
nice little fucking

28:47.240 --> 28:48.670

several convicted

28:56.370 --> 28:57.990

29:00.550 --> 29:02.290

an Oscar for this.

they'll go for it?

29:04.710 --> 29:05.680

I need you to focus.

Man down!

29:37.780 --> 29:39.980
Shit!

29:39.980 --> 29:41.670
I'm hoping if I can
get at O'Connor,

29:41.670 --> 29:45.570
he'll meet us on the next level.
Shit!

You fucking bet we do.

What about Chris
and the others?

32:03.140 --> 32:04.010
Don't worry.

32:10.370 --> 32:12.730
It seems to be quite obvious
that with every minute

32:12.730 --> 32:14.880
those hostages are in there,
including Miss Holden,

32:14.880 --> 32:17.720
and with the SAS
seemingly involved,

32:17.720 --> 32:20.300
isn't it true that you've
lost control of the situation?

32:20.300 --> 32:22.490
Listen, I can
categorically assure you we

32:22.490 --> 32:23.720
have everything under control.

32:38.640 --> 32:39.680
How's our home movie doing?

Well, let's get it into
the hands it needs to be in.

32:47.830 --> 32:49.110
It's just uploading now.

32:55.290 --> 32:58.380
Sounds like they've taken
down some of the building.

I don't think
we're gonna get out

32:59.480 --> 33:01.270

to handle himself.

survive that, sure...

to be many hostages

33:37.390 --> 33:38.690

33:38.690 --> 33:41.700
And as you can see,
large amount of particles

33:41.700 --> 33:43.300
have been propelled
into the atmosphere,

33:43.300 --> 33:45.120
covering police vehicles.

the current situation.

dead a little while longer, eh?

35:25.410 --> 35:26.500
I heard them mention a tunnel.

another way out of here.

Won't be a minute.

36:01.150 --> 36:02.580
One minute?

36:02.580 --> 36:04.040
You said that a minute ago.

36:06.960 --> 36:09.970
So it's now literally just
a minute, right, James?

36:09.970 --> 36:10.670
A minute.

36:13.450 --> 36:16.280
So, 60 seconds.

36:16.280 --> 36:17.110
It's just coming up now.

36:17.110 --> 36:18.010
It won't take a bit longer.

think with my balls.

past experience, people die.

no demands for ransom.

- Yes, I am.

36:47.720 --> 36:49.080
Well, that didn't
take you long.

36:49.080 --> 36:51.570
I'm just here to observe
and liaise with my colleagues

36:51.570 --> 36:54.040
in the Special Security Service.

36:54.040 --> 36:56.400
If you are on top of this,
then the show is yours.

36:56.400 --> 36:58.870
If you fuck up once,
we take the reins

36:58.870 --> 37:02.190
and you take the rest
of your career off.

37:02.190 --> 37:04.580
Oi, don't you fucking
walk away from me.

37:04.580 --> 37:07.620
I'm on a night off and
I get dragged in here

37:07.620 --> 37:09.700
to deal with a hostage
situation that, to all intents

37:09.700 --> 37:12.800
and purposes, was caused by your
inept Security Services doing

37:12.800 --> 37:15.040
a piss poor job guarding Alice.

37:15.040 --> 37:18.970
And then you've got a load of
SAS running in cock-handed...

37:18.970 --> 37:20.690
I don't know what's going on.

37:20.690 --> 37:23.950
I don't know how many
people are alive or dead

37:23.950 --> 37:25.880
or how many floors
have collapsed

37:25.880 --> 37:27.970
or what the situation is.

37:27.970 --> 37:30.640
So if you think you want
to take over, be my guest.

37:30.640 --> 37:33.430
But until that time, fuck off.

37:36.240 --> 37:39.010
Well, the Prime Minister
and the rest of his family

37:39.010 --> 37:40.690
have been removed
from Downing Street.

37:40.690 --> 37:43.150
They've been taken
to a safe location.

37:43.150 --> 37:45.460

assumed his responsibility

37:45.460 --> 37:46.990
for the moment.

keep his kids at home.

That shocking video, delivered
exclusively to me here

38:02.040 --> 38:04.240
on the scene, appears
to show Alice,

38:04.240 --> 38:06.370
the Prime Minister's
daughter, issuing demands...

38:06.370 --> 38:07.200
I want a word with you.

38:07.200 --> 38:08.680
I'm live on air.

38:08.680 --> 38:10.140
Not anymore.
CAMERAMAN: Hey!

38:14.870 --> 38:18.920
Speaking of things
that annoy me,

38:18.920 --> 38:23.240
it's people... it's, it's
people that pretend that they

38:23.240 --> 38:24.040
know what they're doing.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.740
Do you know what I mean, James?

38:25.740 --> 38:26.630
Like, not experts.

38:31.760 --> 38:34.240
How does someone anonymously
hand you something?

38:34.240 --> 38:35.630
You must've seen his face.

38:35.630 --> 38:37.810
He was gone before
I could see his face.

38:37.810 --> 38:39.080
Some journalist you are.

38:39.080 --> 38:40.600
It's Lowe.

38:40.600 --> 38:43.240
Hey, mate, get rid of her
and get the memory stick.

38:43.240 --> 38:46.090
Right, everyone,
shut the fuck up.

38:46.090 --> 38:50.190
I've got a man on the
inside on the line.

38:50.190 --> 38:51.360
Chris?

38:51.360 --> 38:54.130
We're live.

38:54.130 --> 38:57.030
But unfortunately,
so are these fucking

38:57.030 --> 39:00.380

moving on towards the target.

39:00.380 --> 39:01.980
CARPENTER (ON PHONE): I
hate to say this, Chris,

39:01.980 --> 39:04.470
but it looks like you're
our only hope right now.

39:04.470 --> 39:06.350
We're stuck here on the outside.
Yeah.

39:06.350 --> 39:07.550
CARPENTER (ON PHONE):
You gotta keep

39:07.550 --> 39:08.900
going down to get that girl.

39:08.900 --> 39:10.840
You can tell the Prime
Minister that the SAS

39:10.840 --> 39:12.550
will have his daughter
back before Christmas.

39:12.550 --> 39:14.430
Six poppadoms.

39:14.430 --> 39:16.140
Mhm.

39:16.140 --> 39:17.620
Busy night tonight,
eh, detective?

39:17.620 --> 39:18.980
- It seems to be.
- Williams.

39:18.980 --> 39:20.960
We got the SAS
team on the phone.

39:20.960 --> 39:22.200
From inside?

39:22.200 --> 39:23.920
Bring my food out to me, yeah?
Yeah, yeah.

[PHONE RINGING]

39:32.180 --> 39:35.060

39:35.060 --> 39:36.020
Fuck.

39:36.020 --> 39:37.740
Right, cut the lines.
What?

39:37.740 --> 39:39.240
We're gonna cut the...
Cut the fucking lines!

39:39.240 --> 39:40.970

OK.

Cut them.

It's done.

It's cut.

Yes, it is.

You can work to a deadline.

Are you there?

Fuck's sake.

40:01.860 --> 40:04.160
They're on to us, mate.

40:04.160 --> 40:04.970
Comms are down.

40:09.430 --> 40:11.490
Still got 30 seconds, James.

40:11.490 --> 40:12.980
Get back to work.

40:19.930 --> 40:23.500
Ever since word got out
about me being taken,

40:23.500 --> 40:27.250
he wouldn't be Prime
Minister anymore.

40:27.250 --> 40:34.720
That way, they can't force
him to launch nuclear missiles

40:34.720 --> 40:37.650
or get rid of the national debt.

40:37.650 --> 40:40.580
HOSTAGE: Are you saying
no one's coming for us?

40:40.580 --> 40:44.510
I'm just a normal citizen
like everyone else now.

40:47.770 --> 40:50.920
Chris, all these dead office
workers, the phone lines

40:50.920 --> 40:52.410
cut... this mission's
looking more

40:52.410 --> 40:54.490
and more like a lost cause.

40:54.490 --> 40:55.600
Yeah, maybe.

40:55.600 --> 40:58.830
But I'm gonna get Alice
out of here... alive.

41:03.010 --> 41:06.310
And those fuckers probably
have no idea Steve's on his way

41:06.310 --> 41:07.150
down too.

41:17.420 --> 41:18.400
Don't touch me!

41:18.400 --> 41:19.380
Get off!

41:19.380 --> 41:21.330
It's all right, we're SAS.

41:21.330 --> 41:23.290
Where are the men who did this?

41:23.290 --> 41:26.220
(SOBBING) I don't know.

41:26.220 --> 41:29.640
I just worked here.

41:29.640 --> 41:32.110
Well, this place could
collapse at any moment.

41:32.110 --> 41:33.400
Gotta get out.

to meet our honey trap.

seriously scary PMT.

CARPENTER (VOICEOVER):
Local authority

42:06.070 --> 42:08.990
says there no direct access
between the sewers through.

42:08.990 --> 42:12.240
We've got every local
manhole covered.

42:12.240 --> 42:13.460
The original
blueprints were lost

42:13.460 --> 42:15.250
in the local town hall fire.

42:15.250 --> 42:17.870
You're lucky we've got this.

42:17.870 --> 42:20.500
Can we see if we can get
someone half decent to find

42:20.500 --> 42:23.780
out who the arsonist was?

42:23.780 --> 42:26.790
Do you think
they're suicide ones?

42:26.790 --> 42:30.110
That's the reason
why we're down here,

42:30.110 --> 42:33.910
underground with no access.

42:33.910 --> 42:36.000
So they're gonna kill
themselves and then they're

42:36.000 --> 42:37.450
gonna take us with them.

42:37.450 --> 42:41.230
They don't seem religious.

42:41.230 --> 42:45.480
Not like they care
about anything.

42:45.480 --> 42:48.130
Maybe they're mercenaries
being hired by someone.

42:57.820 --> 42:59.280
It's down there?

42:59.280 --> 43:00.250
Keep your voice down.

43:03.180 --> 43:05.290
Are you sure this is right?

43:05.290 --> 43:06.970
We're going down to get out?

43:06.970 --> 43:09.790
You have to go down to find
the old maintenance shaft.

43:09.790 --> 43:11.530
It's gonna take us back up.

43:38.370 --> 43:39.370

Get her!

43:43.340 --> 43:44.340
Get the bitch!

44:16.250 --> 44:18.370
What about the bank next door?

44:18.370 --> 44:20.870
Could they be trying to
rob the vault or something?

44:20.870 --> 44:22.290
No, it's just an
investment bank.

44:22.290 --> 44:24.060
There's no vault
or money on site.

44:24.060 --> 44:26.000
What kind of bank
doesn't have money inside?

44:26.000 --> 44:27.850
Well, it's one of those
ones for the uber-rich.

44:27.850 --> 44:31.050
You know, pop stars,
politicians, royalty.

44:31.050 --> 44:33.290
The Prime Minister and
the Queen bank there.

44:33.290 --> 44:34.350
What?

44:34.350 --> 44:36.010
The Queen, I guess,
doesn't really use money.

44:36.010 --> 44:36.710
No, not that.

44:36.710 --> 44:39.400

Prime Minister banks there?

fucking shoot you.

close to the 15th floor.

is even still alive?

when to stop looking for her

47:45.260 --> 47:46.930

finding bodies, mate.
