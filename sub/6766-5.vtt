{\an1}I'm just finishing

03:30.043 --> 03:31.127
You want to come in?

03:31.210 --> 03:33.755
{\an3}I don't know. Is
your father in there?

03:33.838 --> 03:35.798
No. He's out of town.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.467
Come on. I'll give
you the grand tour.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.093
{\an3}All right.

03:49.771 --> 03:52.440
{\an1}This is quite
some humble abode.

03:52.523 --> 03:54.609
{\an3}My father built this place
about ten years ago.

03:54.692 --> 03:56.611
{\an3}After my mother
passed away,

03:56.694 --> 03:58.821
he really couldn't stay
in Dana Point anymore.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.865
{\an1}Yeah, I know
what that's like.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.742
My father died
two years ago.

04:02.825 --> 04:05.244
I'm sorry.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.580
{\an3}Come on.
Let's go in here.

04:11.793 --> 04:14.379
This is the
dining room.

04:14.462 --> 04:15.630
{\an3}Like it?

04:15.713 --> 04:17.714
Yeah. What's
not to like?

04:17.798 --> 04:18.882
Good. Because
you're going

04:18.966 --> 04:20.051
to be having dinner
here tomorrow night.

04:20.134 --> 04:21.719
{\an3}WYep.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.429
You and all
your closest friends.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.390
Excuse me?

04:25.473 --> 04:26.557
I knew, if I told you,

04:26.641 --> 04:27.642
you wouldn't let me
go ahead with it,

04:27.725 --> 04:28.977
so I got their numbers from Nat,

04:29.060 --> 04:31.604
{\an3}and I pretty much
invited everyone you know.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.564
Uh-huh. And you want
that kind of riffraff

04:33.648 --> 04:35.525
hanging out here
in your nice house?

04:35.608 --> 04:37.402
Yeah. I want
to get to know them,

04:37.485 --> 04:39.904
and I want them
to get to know me.

04:39.988 --> 04:41.906
Well, you were right
about one thing.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.700
If I <i> had</i> known, there's no way

04:43.783 --> 04:45.535
I would ever let
you go through with it.

04:49.664 --> 04:52.500
And this is my
father's study.

04:52.583 --> 04:55.169
This is actually my favorite
room in the house.

04:55.253 --> 04:58.589
{\an1}Everything in here has
special meaning to my father.

05:01.759 --> 05:03.678
See that desk?

05:03.761 --> 05:05.555
{\an5}When I was little,
I used to sit there
and do my homework.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.890
See, this is where
you and I differ,

05:07.974 --> 05:14.022
because me, I was never really
too big on the homework thing.

05:14.105 --> 05:15.440
Is this your dad?

05:15.523 --> 05:18.693
On the right. Yeah.

05:18.776 --> 05:20.695
Who's tI don't know.

05:20.778 --> 05:22.822
Must be a friend, or someone
he does business with.

05:26.951 --> 05:30.163

{\an5}KELLY:
<i>I guess I'm going.</i>
<i>I mean, I said yes.</i>

05:39.672 --> 05:41.966
{\an1}I know. I mean, I was
so shocked when Toni called.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.135
{\an3}I know. Doesn't that
seem a bit pushy?

05:44.218 --> 05:45.762
{\an3}I mean, she hardly
even knows us.

05:45.845 --> 05:47.764
{\an1}Oh, come on. She's
just trying to be nice.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.432
{\an1}You're just jealous
because she likes Dylan.

05:49.515 --> 05:51.267
Am not!.

05:51.350 --> 05:54.687
Guys, regardless,
we still can't say no, right?

05:55.855 --> 05:57.106
Well, here you go.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.442
{\an1}A plate of fried food
for the tutor who got me

05:59.525 --> 06:01.110
{\an1}through my
first math quiz.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.279
Mmm! Onion rings
and french fries.

06:03.362 --> 06:05.114
HaOh, I seelf.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.449
{\an1}you've gotten him
up to fractions now.

06:06.532 --> 06:07.784
Have any of you

06:07.867 --> 06:09.077
{\an3}guys heard
or seen David

06:09.160 --> 06:10.119
in the last few days?

06:10.203 --> 06:11.287
{\an3}DONNA:
He hasn't been in class

06:11.370 --> 06:12.455
in the last week.

06:12.538 --> 06:13.623
I talked to Mel
the other day.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.584
{\an5}He said that he's
really depressed
about his mother.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.127
How's she doing?

06:18.211 --> 06:21.339
Not great. That's
why I'm worried.

06:38.022 --> 06:39.649
{\an1}Hey, Ma.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.192
How you doing?

06:41.275 --> 06:44.487
The doctor says
you're doing better.

06:46.114 --> 06:49.450
You look good.

06:49.534 --> 06:52.286
Nurse told me
you got a bath today.

06:58.960 --> 07:02.839
Would you talk to me, please?

07:02.922 --> 07:05.842
I know you're awake.

07:05.925 --> 07:09.053
Please?

07:10.638 --> 07:12.849
{\an1}Come on.
Let her rest.

07:21.899 --> 07:25.444
So when is she going
to get better?

07:25.528 --> 07:27.822
I've been through this
with her before, David.

07:27.905 --> 07:30.825
{\an1}You've got
to give it time.

07:30.908 --> 07:32.076
{\an3}Dad, she won't
even look at me.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.369
{\an3}She won't even
talk to me.

07:33.452 --> 07:35.997
{\an1}I know this has
been rough, David,

07:36.080 --> 07:37.832
but that's why we all
have to stay strong.

07:37.915 --> 07:41.836
Are you keeping up
with your classes?

07:41.919 --> 07:44.297
My classes? What,
are you kidding?

07:44.380 --> 07:46.716
{\an3}How can I concentrate
on school?

07:46.799 --> 07:49.010
{\an3}Do you just go to the
office and fill cavities

07:49.093 --> 07:50.428
{\an3}and pretend like
nothing is happening?

07:50.511 --> 07:53.598
{\an1}Actually, yes, I do.
Life goes on.

07:53.681 --> 07:55.892
Not for me.

07:55.975 --> 07:58.060
Could I talk to you
both for a moment?

07:58.144 --> 08:00.229
I wish I had
Hobetter news.g?

08:00.313 --> 08:03.524
{\an3}Come on.
Let's sit down.

08:05.985 --> 08:09.030
She's not responding
to the treatment?

08:09.113 --> 08:12.450
{\an3}We may have to get
more aggressive.

08:12.533 --> 08:13.701
What does that mean?

08:13.784 --> 08:14.869
When drug therapies

08:14.952 --> 08:17.914
don't work, we have to look
at alternative approaches.

08:17.997 --> 08:18.998
{\an1}Like what?

08:19.081 --> 08:21.083
Given her age, her physical
health and her history,

08:21.167 --> 08:23.920
my recommendation would
be a short course

08:24.003 --> 08:27.006
of low-level
electroconvulsive therapy.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.092
What? You mean
electric shock treatment?

08:30.176 --> 08:31.093
It may sound

08:31.177 --> 08:33.471
barbaric, but we know a lot more

08:33.554 --> 08:34.972
about ECT than we used to,

08:35.056 --> 08:37.099
and I have to tell you,
we've had some terrific results.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.433
{\an1}Isn't this
a little extreme?

08:38.517 --> 08:39.936
Actually, no.

08:40.019 --> 08:42.270
She's not coming out of this
depression. This may help.

08:42.355 --> 08:46.108
{\an3}Come on, Dad. You
can't let them do this.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.110
What exactly is involved?

08:48.194 --> 08:49.111
We sedate her,

08:49.195 --> 08:51.906
give her a heavy dose
of muscle relaxants.

08:51.989 --> 08:54.784
Then, through electrodes
attached to her skull,

08:54.867 --> 08:56.911
we administer
brief pulses

08:56.994 --> 08:59.163
{\an3}of low-voltage
electrical current.

08:59.247 --> 09:00.623
No more than that which

09:00.706 --> 09:04.043
would make a 100-watt bulb
flicker for just a second.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.964
And what are the side effects?

09:08.047 --> 09:10.466
{\an6}There may be
some short-term
memory loss.

09:10.549 --> 09:12.468
Studies show that
most missing memory

09:12.551 --> 09:14.303
returns within six months.

09:14.387 --> 09:18.599
{\an5}I also must tell you
there is a mortality
rate-- one in 20,000.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.309
You mean she could die?

09:20.393 --> 09:22.186
{\an3}For someone as depressed
as your mother,

09:22.270 --> 09:24.438
there's a lot greater chance
that,<i> without</i> this therapy,

09:24.522 --> 09:27.441
she'll attempt suicide again,
and succeed.

09:27.525 --> 09:31.028
No. No, forget
it, all right?

09:31.112 --> 09:32.863
You're not turning my mom
into a reading lamp.

09:32.947 --> 09:33.906
{\an1}David.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.491
I don't want to hear
anything else about this.

09:35.574 --> 09:36.826
All right, Dad?

09:51.382 --> 09:53.301
Why don't you get
a dorm room, man?

09:53.384 --> 09:54.885
You spend more time
on this campus than I do.

09:54.969 --> 09:56.387
{\an1}Yeah, well, I'm just
waiting for Toni.

09:56.470 --> 09:57.847
{\an1}She gets out of class
in a minute,

09:57.930 --> 09:59.181
{\an1}and we're going
to the beach.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.308
Ah! Young love.

10:00.391 --> 10:01.851
Ain't it grand?

10:01.934 --> 10:03.644
{\an3}So what's with
this dinner party?

10:03.728 --> 10:04.312
You coming?

10:04.395 --> 10:05.396
{\an3}Of course.

10:05.479 --> 10:06.814
{\an3}I can't wait to
meet the old man.

10:06.897 --> 10:08.399
Oh, neither can I.

10:08.482 --> 10:09.984
Too bad he's out of town.

10:10.067 --> 10:11.819
{\an1}She showed me around
the house the other day.

10:11.902 --> 10:14.030
You would not believe what
this guy has in his study.

10:14.113 --> 10:16.157
A signed confession?

10:16.240 --> 10:19.035
{\an1}A picture of him with his arm
around Jack. He's sick.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.328
And Toni doesn't know
anything about this?

10:20.411 --> 10:21.996
Not a clue.

10:22.079 --> 10:23.748
{\an3}Should be an
interesting evening.

10:23.831 --> 10:25.207
{\an1}Anybody else know
what you know?

10:25.291 --> 10:26.375
I haven't said a word.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.419
Yeah.it that way.

10:28.502 --> 10:30.379
Espresso, please.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.173
Actually, make
that a triple.

10:32.256 --> 10:34.175
Rough night, huh?

10:34.258 --> 10:36.927
Yeah. I didn't
get much sleep.

10:37.011 --> 10:38.179
{\an1}Anything you want
to talk about?

10:38.262 --> 10:39.555
No, I'll be all right.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.514
Do you want something?

10:40.598 --> 10:42.391
{\an1}No, thanks. I got a meeting
with my editor.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.143
{\an3}Oh, yes. The
illustrious Susan Keats.

10:44.226 --> 10:45.561
{\an3}You guys are
getting pretty cozy.

10:45.644 --> 10:47.229
Not as cozy
as I'd like.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.397
{\an3}Why don't you bring her
to the dinner party?

10:48.481 --> 10:50.232
{\an1}Already one step
ahead of you.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.525
Think she'll come?

10:51.609 --> 10:52.735
How could she say no?

10:52.818 --> 10:53.861
No.

10:53.944 --> 10:55.112
{\an3}Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute.

10:55.196 --> 10:56.113
It's just a dinner party.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.031
What's the big deal?

10:57.114 --> 10:58.532
{\an3}A dinner party with
all your friends.

10:58.616 --> 10:59.575
So?

10:59.658 --> 11:01.243
{\an3}So I just
don't think

11:01.327 --> 11:03.412
{\an3}we should go out
together, that's all.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.582
Then what was that kiss about?

11:06.665 --> 11:09.043
{\an3}It was a moment
of weakness.

11:09.126 --> 11:11.170
Weak women--
my specialty.

11:11.253 --> 11:14.090
{\an3}You'll live to
regret that remark.

11:14.173 --> 11:16.133
Close the door.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.639
Sit down.

11:27.186 --> 11:29.105
You have a choice.

11:29.188 --> 11:30.439
I can fire you

11:30.523 --> 11:32.608
and we can go to the
dinner party, or...

11:32.692 --> 11:36.612
you keep your job
and we go our separate ways.

11:36.695 --> 11:38.280
That's ridiculous.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.615
I don't think so.

11:39.698 --> 11:41.450
I get it.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.953
You're afraid
of workplace romances.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.454
That's easy--
you fire me,

11:45.538 --> 11:47.790
we go to the dinner,
you rehire me tomorrow.

11:47.873 --> 11:48.582
Brandon, I'm serious, okay?

11:48.666 --> 11:50.251
Look, I know
we can get involved.

11:50.334 --> 11:52.128
I just don't happen
to think it's a good idea.

11:52.211 --> 11:54.630
So you <i> are</i> attracted to me.

11:54.713 --> 11:58.134
Oh, i-if I admit it,
will you go back to work?

11:58.217 --> 11:59.593
Sure.

11:59.677 --> 12:01.595
Okay, fine, I admit it.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.514
I am attracted to you.

12:03.597 --> 12:05.850
{\an6}I'm attracted to
a lot of things:
hot fudge sundaes,

12:05.933 --> 12:07.935
acid jazz, big headlines.

12:08.018 --> 12:11.021
Now, do me a favor,
go write your column.

12:21.907 --> 12:24.493
(laughs)

12:27.955 --> 12:29.665
(knocking)

12:29.748 --> 12:31.584
{\an1}DONNA:
David, open up, please.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.752
Go away, please.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.839
(knocking)

12:41.427 --> 12:43.345
(sighs)

12:46.807 --> 12:47.600
What?

12:47.683 --> 12:49.852
It's almost 2:00--
you're not up yet?

12:49.935 --> 12:51.020
No, I've been up.

12:51.103 --> 12:52.771
{\an6}KELLY:
You know, it
smells in here.

12:52.855 --> 12:55.316
{\an6}You should probably
open up some windows,
let some air in.

12:55.399 --> 12:56.984
Thanks.

12:57.067 --> 12:58.652
How's your mom doing?

12:58.736 --> 13:00.488
(wry chuckle):
She's nutty as a fruitcake.

13:00.571 --> 13:01.655
Haven't you heard?

13:01.739 --> 13:02.907
How about you?

13:02.990 --> 13:04.492
I'm fine.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.785
Would you guys
leave me alone now, please?

13:06.869 --> 13:08.037
David...

13:08.120 --> 13:09.997
{\an3}you have to get on
with your life.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.249
{\an1}And how long is that
supposed to take, Kel?

13:12.333 --> 13:14.210
Why don't you tell me
how I'm supposed to feel

13:14.293 --> 13:16.670
when the only hope for my mother
is if they attach electrodes

13:16.754 --> 13:17.880
to her head and fry her brain.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.673
I'm sorry.

13:19.757 --> 13:22.384
Be as sorry as you want to be.

13:24.929 --> 13:27.389
David, please
let us help, all right?

13:27.473 --> 13:28.891
You need some help.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.559
Thanks a lot, Kel.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.353
Maybe they should strap
electrodes to <i> my</i> head.

13:32.436 --> 13:33.896
Come on, you're
talking crazy.

13:33.979 --> 13:36.524
Maybe I am crazy.

13:36.607 --> 13:38.526
I don't know.

13:38.609 --> 13:40.486
Maybe it's in my blood.

13:41.570 --> 13:44.907
David, don't do this.

13:44.990 --> 13:47.618
{\an3}(exhales)

13:52.581 --> 13:54.083
(knocking)

13:54.166 --> 13:55.918
Who is it?

13:56.001 --> 13:57.253
It's Brandon.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.546
Brandon?!

13:58.629 --> 14:00.548
I'm really busy.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.967
{\an1}Well, this is
kind of important.

14:03.050 --> 14:05.094
Well, what do you want?

14:05.177 --> 14:08.222
You're not looking at me
through that peephole, are you?

14:08.305 --> 14:10.474
{\an1}(laughs):
Mm-hmm.o.

14:10.558 --> 14:11.976
Look, couldn't you
have used the phone?

14:12.059 --> 14:13.727
I'm right in the middle
of trying

14:13.811 --> 14:14.937
to finish with an article here.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.273
This will only
take a minute.

14:17.356 --> 14:18.857
(exhales)

14:21.151 --> 14:23.612
Okay, but only
for a minute.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.781
Can I, uh, come in?

14:25.864 --> 14:27.950
{\an3}Oh, yeah, sure,
come on in.

14:28.033 --> 14:30.953
Thanks.

14:31.036 --> 14:34.623
Wow. This is quite a place
you have here.

14:34.707 --> 14:35.958
Private bathroom and everything.

14:36.041 --> 14:38.294
You must know
all the right people.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.796
{\an3}Look, I really
am busy, so, um,

14:40.879 --> 14:41.964
what is it?

14:42.047 --> 14:43.632
All right, I'll get
right to the point.

14:43.716 --> 14:44.800
{\an1}I thought about it,
and I quit.

14:44.883 --> 14:47.094
You are not gonna
give up, are you?

14:47.177 --> 14:48.470
I think that
some things

14:48.554 --> 14:51.599
are more important than others,
and I think that...

14:51.682 --> 14:53.517
going out with you may be

14:53.601 --> 14:56.520
{\an1}more important than my job,
maybe, possibly, kinda,

14:56.604 --> 14:57.980
what do you think?

14:58.063 --> 14:59.982
{\an3}I'm not sure how
to take that.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.442
{\an1}Well, as an editor
you should be devastated,

15:01.525 --> 15:02.776
butAs a woman,...

15:02.860 --> 15:03.861
{\an3}I'm a little
concerned you have

15:03.944 --> 15:05.279
{\an3}this much trouble
getting a date.

15:05.362 --> 15:06.697
Is that a yes?

15:06.780 --> 15:08.991
{\an6}(sighs):
Well, a girl's
got to eat.

15:09.074 --> 15:11.869
{\an3}So, what time are you
gonna pick me up?

15:11.952 --> 15:13.162
Tomorrow night.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.706
I'll be here at 7:30,
right after I finish

15:15.789 --> 15:18.208
cleBrandon, relax.sk.

15:18.292 --> 15:19.710
You don't have to quit.

15:19.793 --> 15:21.045
You called my bluff.

15:21.128 --> 15:23.047
No, Didn't anyoneist.

15:23.130 --> 15:24.882
ever tell you that
when you strike oil

15:24.965 --> 15:26.216
that you stop drilling?

15:26.300 --> 15:29.011
No. So,(laughs) uh...

15:29.094 --> 15:30.971
I finished my column.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.307
{\an3}It's on the value
of persistence.

15:33.390 --> 15:34.600
Ah.

15:34.683 --> 15:37.144
As they say,
write what you know.

15:37.227 --> 15:38.979
{\an3}Yeah. That's what
you got to do.

15:39.063 --> 15:40.022
Careful.

15:40.105 --> 15:41.815
(both chuckle)

15:41.899 --> 15:43.567
Yeah. Well...

15:43.651 --> 15:44.985
see you tomorrow.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.236
{\an3}Thanks.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.995
{\an5}VALERIE:

<i>more cheerful,</i>

15:55.079 --> 15:56.705

15:56.789 --> 15:58.749

16:00.084 --> 16:02.044
<i>Give my love to Jim.</i>
<i>Love, Valerie.</i>

16:02.127 --> 16:04.004
Steve, I'm telling you, this
is gonna work out great, man.

16:04.088 --> 16:05.506
We're gonna have
more games on Sundays,

16:05.589 --> 16:06.965
{\an3}we're gonna have
better games on Sunday,

16:07.049 --> 16:08.884
no more Rams,
Ino more Raiders.

16:08.967 --> 16:11.345
L.A. is the center
Lifeof the universe.end.

16:11.428 --> 16:13.055
{\an1}How can we be without
a football team?

16:13.138 --> 16:15.808
The sun is the center
Val, you want an apple?

16:17.643 --> 16:19.353
No.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.064
Did I say something?

16:22.147 --> 16:23.732
Probably.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.984
I'm gonna go find out.

16:34.326 --> 16:36.537
Catching some Z's?

16:37.788 --> 16:40.124
Yeah, trying.

16:40.207 --> 16:42.418
Why don't you go upstairs
and go to bed.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.920
I want to stay here.

16:46.797 --> 16:49.258
Do you remember my father?

16:49.341 --> 16:50.718
{\an1}Sure.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.428
He had a heck of a jump shot.

16:52.511 --> 16:53.971
You don't remember

16:54.054 --> 16:56.265
all those games of two on two
we used to play,

16:56.348 --> 16:58.225
me and Jim against
you and your dad?

16:59.184 --> 17:00.853
No.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.064
No, I wish I did.

17:05.357 --> 17:08.777
I don't have any nice memories
of my father anymore.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.112
Why not?

17:10.194 --> 17:12.781
Did you know
I was the one who found him

17:12.865 --> 17:14.407
the night he killed himself?

17:16.201 --> 17:18.119
I had no idea.

17:18.203 --> 17:20.289
{\an3}Yeah, it was
really horrible.

17:20.372 --> 17:22.624
His brains were
all over the bathroom wall.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.294
{\an1}Val, are you sure you want
to talk about this?

17:25.377 --> 17:27.755
Yeah, I have to.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.258
David's mother, huh?

17:31.341 --> 17:34.344
Yeah, bad luck for me.

17:37.347 --> 17:40.976
I was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

17:41.059 --> 17:43.479
You know, it took me
a whole year afterwards

17:43.562 --> 17:46.190
to... be able to sleep
through the whole night

17:46.273 --> 17:50.486
and... and now I'm right back
in that place again.

17:50.569 --> 17:53.614
{\an3}Do you ever call your mother
and talk aboI can't.

17:53.697 --> 17:55.699
She blames me.

17:58.118 --> 18:00.329
That's why
I can't go home again.

18:00.412 --> 18:02.039
How could she possibly

18:02.122 --> 18:03.874
blame you?

18:03.957 --> 18:06.877
I was pretty wild, Brandon.

18:06.960 --> 18:09.004
{\an3}I mean, I was a
big disappointment

18:09.087 --> 18:10.547
to my folks.

18:10.631 --> 18:12.382
I mean, they
weren't getting along,

18:12.466 --> 18:14.343
and they were always
fighting about me.

18:14.426 --> 18:19.181
Yeah, but, Val, that's no reason
for someone to kill themselves.

18:19.264 --> 18:21.016
{\an1}There must've been
other problems.

18:21.099 --> 18:22.893
Yeah, there were.

18:24.561 --> 18:28.524
But, as far as my mom
was concerned, it was me.

18:32.069 --> 18:33.862
Can you grab me a pillow?

18:33.946 --> 18:36.240
I think I'm gonna try
sleeping down here tonight.

18:36.323 --> 18:38.200
Yeah.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.701
Sure.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.495
Anything else?

18:41.578 --> 18:45.541
Yeah. Tell Steve it's his turn
to take out the trash.

19:10.023 --> 19:11.567
God, what a cast!

19:11.650 --> 19:13.402
{\an1}Danny De Vito
and Christopher Lloyd.

19:13.485 --> 19:14.945
They were so young.

19:15.028 --> 19:17.865
(laughs)uch more hair.

19:17.948 --> 19:18.907
I love Nicholson.

19:18.991 --> 19:22.077
{\an1}Nobody plays a crazy guy
better than him, you know?

19:22.160 --> 19:25.080
That's 'cause he wasn't crazy,
and that was the whole point.

19:25.163 --> 19:27.040
You guys have got
to read the book.

19:27.124 --> 19:28.584
Kesey wrote <i> Cuckoo's Nest</i>

19:28.667 --> 19:31.879
while he was an orderly
in a mental hospital.

19:33.714 --> 19:36.341
Uh, I'll just
take that cold, actually.

19:37.509 --> 19:38.886
Thanks.

19:38.969 --> 19:40.012
David.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.139
Hey.

19:42.222 --> 19:43.515
David, come sit down--
we were

19:43.599 --> 19:44.975
{\an1}just about to get
some coffee.

19:45.058 --> 19:46.476
I've got a lot to do.

19:46.560 --> 19:47.978
Come on, you really
shouldn't be alone.

19:48.061 --> 19:49.938
(chuckles):
I shouldn't be awake.

19:50.022 --> 19:50.814
Uh, you guys

19:50.898 --> 19:52.733
have a good time.

19:55.193 --> 19:56.945
{\an3}David better snap
out of this,

19:57.029 --> 19:59.448
{\an3}or he's gonna find <i> himself</i>
in the cuckoo's nest.

19:59.531 --> 20:00.782
That's not funny.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.117
{\an1}KELLY:
Sorry, Don,

20:02.201 --> 20:03.911
I'm afraid she's right.

20:09.708 --> 20:12.085
(panting)

20:15.714 --> 20:18.383
(indistinct whispers)

20:29.102 --> 20:33.148
(gasping, grunting)

20:33.231 --> 20:34.483
(gunshot booms)

20:34.566 --> 20:35.817
Daddy!

20:35.901 --> 20:37.027
No! No!

20:38.195 --> 20:39.279
(siren wails in distance)

20:39.363 --> 20:41.531
(distorted screaming)

20:44.076 --> 20:46.411
(loud gasp, panting)

20:48.080 --> 20:50.165
Val?No... no... no...kay.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.167
{\an1}It's okay.
Oh, my God...t.

20:52.250 --> 20:54.169
{\an1}It's okay.
What's going on?

20:54.252 --> 20:57.130
(crying, sniffling):
I can't get rid of it.

20:57.214 --> 20:59.007
I can't ever get rid of it.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.635
{\an1}Hey, hey, it's okay,
it's okay.

21:01.718 --> 21:05.222
{\an3}Let me get you
No, no, just stay, please.

21:05.305 --> 21:07.349
Please don't leave me.

21:07.432 --> 21:09.518
Okay, I'm right here...

21:09.601 --> 21:11.812
It's gonna be okay.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.523
It's gonna be okay.

21:15.899 --> 21:18.318
{\an3}Get your hands off
the mushrooms, Bruno.

21:18.402 --> 21:20.195
{\an3}You better be nice
to me, Antonia,

21:20.278 --> 21:22.864
or I'm gonna tell your father
you're throwing a dinner party

21:22.948 --> 21:24.074
without asking
his permission.

21:24.157 --> 21:26.076
I am so tired of this, Bruno.

21:26.159 --> 21:27.202
I'm 20 years old.

21:27.285 --> 21:28.578
This <i> is</i> my house.

21:28.662 --> 21:30.580
When is my father
gonna stop checking out

21:30.664 --> 21:32.207
everyone I have
a hamburger with?

21:32.290 --> 21:34.710
{\an3}I've been watching you
with this McKay boy.

21:34.793 --> 21:36.378
You're getting
too involved.

21:36.461 --> 21:38.338
Then stop watching.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.219
Hello?

21:44.302 --> 21:45.512
Hello, sweetheart.

21:45.595 --> 21:47.347
Hi, Daddy.
What are you doing calling me

21:47.431 --> 21:48.557
in the middle of the day?

21:48.640 --> 21:50.058
Are you playing hooky?

21:50.142 --> 21:51.768
Well, actually, I've been
in meeting after meeting.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.729
But you've been
on my mind all day, and...

21:53.812 --> 21:55.063
I wanted to hear your voice.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.773
You holding down
the fort for me?

21:56.857 --> 21:58.233
Everything's fine.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.401
When are you coming home?

21:59.484 --> 22:00.944
Well, hopefully, tomorrow night.

22:01.028 --> 22:03.071
I can't wait.
Bring me something?

22:03.155 --> 22:04.156
Don't I always?

22:04.239 --> 22:05.115
Yes.

22:05.198 --> 22:06.241
I love you, Dad.

22:06.324 --> 22:07.409
I love you, too, sweetheart.

22:07.492 --> 22:08.577
And I miss you.

22:08.660 --> 22:09.745
I miss you, too.

22:09.828 --> 22:12.039
See you tomorrow.

22:14.374 --> 22:17.169
Toni, listen to me.

22:17.252 --> 22:18.420
{\an1}There are things
about this boy

22:18.503 --> 22:19.588
that you don't know.

22:19.671 --> 22:21.256
{\an1}There are things
about this boy

22:21.339 --> 22:23.425
{\an1}that are not gonna make
your father happy.

22:23.508 --> 22:26.178
{\an3}Then don't tell
him, Bruno.

22:26.261 --> 22:28.930
{\an6}Ms. Marchette,
Mr. McKay is here
to see you.

22:29.014 --> 22:30.599
He's out at the pool.

22:30.682 --> 22:31.808
Thank you, Douglas.

22:39.649 --> 22:41.485
You're six hours early.
Party's not till 8:00.

22:41.568 --> 22:42.778
Yeah, I know.

22:42.861 --> 22:44.488
That's why I thought
we'd hit the beach.

22:44.571 --> 22:45.489
I can't go.

22:45.572 --> 22:47.407
{\an1}I'm making dinner
for 12 people.

22:47.491 --> 22:51.411
{\an3}No, no, no, you're <i> supervising</i>
dinner for 12 people.

22:51.495 --> 22:53.080
And that takes
a lot of work.

22:53.163 --> 22:54.915
{\an1}Why don't you try
it sometime?

22:54.998 --> 22:56.750
{\an3}'Cause I'd rather try
something else.

22:56.833 --> 22:58.877
{\an1}What?

22:58.960 --> 23:00.670
{\an3}Well, to be
perfectly honest...

23:03.924 --> 23:05.842
{\an1}(squeals)

23:05.926 --> 23:06.968

23:21.733 --> 23:23.318

23:23.401 --> 23:24.486
Oh, can you believe that?

23:24.569 --> 23:27.322
{\an4}That little stinker
took the bait out
of all the traps.

23:27.405 --> 23:28.824
I know he's down there.

23:28.907 --> 23:31.827
I saw him run under.

23:31.910 --> 23:33.537
{\an1}What kind of cheese
are you using?

23:33.620 --> 23:35.330
{\an3}Camembert.

23:35.413 --> 23:36.957
{\an1}Cam...?

23:37.040 --> 23:38.125
Steve, can you believe?

23:38.208 --> 23:40.961
He's using an imported French
cheese to catch a mouse.

23:41.044 --> 23:41.837
Well, why not?

23:41.920 --> 23:44.339
{\an3}After all, it is
a Beverly Hills mouse.

Steve, you're, uh,
you're paying me.

23:52.264 --> 23:54.224
{\an3}You don't have to keep
buttering me up.

23:54.307 --> 23:55.642
{\an1}It's okay.
You deserve it.

23:55.725 --> 23:58.478
Okay, if you insist.

23:58.562 --> 24:03.191
Mm. Now, Monday morning,
you've got another test.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.317
Are you prepared?

24:04.401 --> 24:05.944
You tell me.

24:09.781 --> 24:12.367
Very good.

24:12.450 --> 24:15.370
{\an1}Yeah, I'm actually getting
my money's worth out of you.

24:15.453 --> 24:17.914
{\an3}Yeah, you might even
pass the course.

24:17.998 --> 24:19.708
(chuckles)

24:19.791 --> 24:20.709
Don't do that.

24:20.792 --> 24:21.877
Do what?

24:21.960 --> 24:25.839
Don't take your arm away.
It felt good.

24:31.761 --> 24:33.555
{\an1}You have a date
for the dinner party tonight?

24:33.638 --> 24:37.392
Actually, I was, um,

24:37.475 --> 24:39.769
{\an3}I was gonna invite this guy
named, uh, Tenderheart.

24:39.853 --> 24:42.230
He's busy.

24:42.314 --> 24:46.610
{\an1}He's taking a girl
named Cuddles.

24:50.197 --> 24:51.114
{\an3}Steve?

24:51.198 --> 24:52.240
Yes?

24:52.324 --> 24:54.034
Are you playing
footsie with me?

24:54.117 --> 24:55.202
No.

24:57.662 --> 24:59.664
(shrieks): A mouse!

24:59.748 --> 25:00.916
GIRL:
What? Where?

25:00.999 --> 25:02.209
{\an3}A mouse!

25:04.044 --> 25:06.922
{\an3}Come on. We can talk
about this over dinner.

25:07.005 --> 25:08.924
I'm not hungry.

25:09.007 --> 25:14.262
{\an3}All right, then we'll
talk about it here.

25:14.346 --> 25:17.057
{\an3}I saw your mom's doctor
again this afternoon.

25:17.140 --> 25:21.061
{\an1}I'm not going along with
this electric shock stuff.

25:21.144 --> 25:22.437
You heard the
doctor, David.

25:22.520 --> 25:24.731
This could be
her only hope.

25:24.814 --> 25:26.733
{\an3}You have to
help me here.

25:26.816 --> 25:28.401
You have to talk to her.

25:28.485 --> 25:29.736
She won't listen to me.

25:29.819 --> 25:30.820
What's the difference?

25:30.904 --> 25:33.865
Why don't you just hook her up
and pull the switch?

25:33.949 --> 25:35.325
She has to give her permission.

25:35.408 --> 25:36.534
She has to sign a release.

25:36.618 --> 25:39.621
If she doesn't want to do it,
why should I convince her?

25:39.704 --> 25:42.249
Because your mom doesn't know
what's best for her now.

25:42.332 --> 25:43.416
We do.

25:45.585 --> 25:46.795
She won't even look at me.

25:46.878 --> 25:51.091
This isn't about <i> you,</i> David.

25:51.174 --> 25:53.134
This is about her.

25:53.218 --> 25:55.470
{\an1}You have to make
the effort for her.

25:55.553 --> 25:59.224
{\an1}Are you gonna back me up
on this?

26:20.412 --> 26:22.455
{\an3}Think we're fashionably
late enough?

26:22.539 --> 26:24.165
{\an1}I think we timed it
perfectly.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.334
{\an1}Are you sure I wore
the right dress?

26:26.418 --> 26:27.460
{\an3}Hi, guys.

26:27.544 --> 26:29.087
Uh, you wanna come on in?

26:29.170 --> 26:30.338
Kelly, you look stunning.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.090
Oh, thank you.
So do you.

26:32.173 --> 26:34.009
{\an4}(quietly):
I told you to go
with the red.

26:34.092 --> 26:35.093
Hmm.

26:35.176 --> 26:37.178
{\an3}This place makes us look
like <i> we're</i> from

26:37.262 --> 26:38.972
the wrong side
of the tracks.

26:39.055 --> 26:41.433
Well, at least you know she's
not after your money, Dylan.

26:41.516 --> 26:43.643
{\an4}Well, it must be
my dazzling sense
of humor.

26:43.727 --> 26:44.728
Oh, yeah.

26:44.811 --> 26:46.730
You're a regular
laugh riot, my friend.

26:46.813 --> 26:48.606
Hmm. Come here.

26:48.690 --> 26:50.025
Excuse me.

26:50.108 --> 26:52.402
{\an1}Don't start
with me, Brandon.

26:52.485 --> 26:53.862
Not here and not now.

26:53.945 --> 26:55.572
{\an5}You know what
the worst part
about this is?

26:55.655 --> 26:56.573
I really like Toni.

26:56.656 --> 26:58.241
Yeah, you're not
the only one.

26:58.325 --> 26:59.534
{\an1}TONI:
Look who's here.

26:59.617 --> 27:01.411
KELLY:
Hello.

27:01.494 --> 27:02.746
{\an3}Whoa,

27:02.829 --> 27:04.122
lady in red.

27:07.876 --> 27:09.878
{\an3}I'm suddenly feeling
very underdressed.

27:09.961 --> 27:11.546
Ah, she's just showing off.

27:13.340 --> 27:16.051
{\an3}She's got a lot
to show off.

27:16.134 --> 27:18.094
{\an1}Do I detect a twinge
of jealousy?

27:18.178 --> 27:20.722
When you're
dating a guy

27:20.805 --> 27:22.849
{\an3}whose ex-girlfriend happens
to be a cover girl,

27:22.932 --> 27:24.851
{\an3}you tend to get a
little self-conscious.

27:24.934 --> 27:26.811
(doorbell rings)

27:29.105 --> 27:32.400
That's all I'm saying.

27:32.484 --> 27:35.528
{\an6}Kelly looks absolutely
stunning tonight,
doesn't she?

27:35.612 --> 27:37.739
I really hadn't noticed.

27:37.822 --> 27:39.699
I was too busy
looking at you.

27:39.783 --> 27:41.576
Good answer.

27:42.660 --> 27:44.371
Thanks. Hi, guys.

27:44.454 --> 27:45.246
{\an3}Hi, Don.

27:45.330 --> 27:46.498
{\an1}TONI:
Hi, Donna.

27:46.581 --> 27:47.540
{\an1}Hey. I'm sorry
I'm late.

27:47.624 --> 27:48.541
Oh, don't worry about it.

27:48.625 --> 27:49.542
Where's Ray?

27:49.626 --> 27:50.418
He was gonna
pick me up,

27:50.502 --> 27:52.045
{\an3}but there's some big
pileup on the 405.

27:52.128 --> 27:53.380
He should be here soon.

27:53.463 --> 27:55.215
Well, that's what you
get for dating someone

27:55.298 --> 27:57.550
from Reseda.

27:57.634 --> 27:59.135
You Westside snob.

27:59.219 --> 28:00.637
I'll tell you
what, Donna.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.764
{\an3}Why don't you grab an hors
d'oeuvre or something?

28:02.847 --> 28:03.765
I'll be right back.

28:03.848 --> 28:04.933
Deserting me so soon?

28:05.016 --> 28:06.643
Well, nature calls.

28:08.144 --> 28:09.437
{\an1}Where's David?
Isn't he coming?

28:09.521 --> 28:11.940
{\an3}He called.
He isn't feeling well.

28:12.023 --> 28:14.484
{\an5}Excuse me. I'm gonna
go check something
out in the kitchen.

28:14.567 --> 28:15.652
Okay.

28:17.987 --> 28:20.240
{\an6}I feel like we
should be doing
something for David.

28:20.323 --> 28:22.450
I agree, but what?

28:22.534 --> 28:24.702
I wish I knew.

28:27.163 --> 28:29.791
Is this an Antista?

28:29.874 --> 28:33.503
{\an4}The last one I saw
was in New York at
the Whitney.

28:33.586 --> 28:37.132
{\an6}I see it as
a celebration of
line and form.

28:37.215 --> 28:41.010
{\an3}The negative space creating
a visual magnetism

28:41.094 --> 28:45.515
{\an3}and tensegritous relationship
between the tangent points.

28:45.598 --> 28:47.308
In other words?

28:47.392 --> 28:49.644
It makes me horny.

29:04.200 --> 29:06.077
Can I help you?

29:08.580 --> 29:09.789
I'm sorry.

29:09.873 --> 29:12.500
I know I'm not supposed
to be up here.

29:12.584 --> 29:13.626
I just had to see something.

29:13.710 --> 29:15.003
What's that?

29:15.920 --> 29:17.797
(sighs)

29:21.759 --> 29:22.802
This is my father.

29:22.886 --> 29:25.221
I know.

29:25.305 --> 29:26.639
I know who you are.

29:26.723 --> 29:29.058
Does Marchette?

29:29.142 --> 29:30.810
{\an3}Of course.

29:30.894 --> 29:32.145
Does Toni?

29:34.063 --> 29:35.565
I met your father.

29:35.648 --> 29:36.900
You're a lot like him.

29:36.983 --> 29:39.194
I don't know exactly
how to take that.

29:39.277 --> 29:42.530
Obviously, not everybody
thought that much of my dad.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.157
He was always right by me.

29:45.658 --> 29:47.785
I think you should go back
to the dinner party.

29:51.998 --> 29:54.209
One more thing, Dylan.

29:54.292 --> 29:56.753
{\an3}Antonia's like
a daughter to me.

29:56.836 --> 29:59.506
Don't forget that.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.892
(knocking)

30:10.975 --> 30:15.021
David, if you're in there,
please open up.

30:15.104 --> 30:16.022
David!

30:16.105 --> 30:17.273
He's not in there.

30:17.357 --> 30:18.274
Hey.

30:18.358 --> 30:21.069
{\an3}What do you guys do,
draw straws or something?

30:21.152 --> 30:23.696
{\an1}Excuse me?

30:23.780 --> 30:24.864
{\an3}Never mind.

30:24.948 --> 30:27.116
Listen, I just wanted
to see how you were.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.785
{\an1}I haven't seen you around
for awhile.

30:28.868 --> 30:32.038
{\an3}Yeah, well, I kinda want
to eat this while it's hot,

30:32.121 --> 30:34.374
{\an6}and I'm not really
in the mood for
any company.

30:34.457 --> 30:35.458
David, wait.

30:40.797 --> 30:42.715
How's your mom doing?

30:42.799 --> 30:46.886
Never better.

30:46.970 --> 30:49.889
{\an1}You want something
to eat?

30:49.973 --> 30:52.934
Um, no, thanks.

30:53.017 --> 30:56.437
{\an1}Listen, I know what
you're going through.

30:56.521 --> 30:57.605
Yeah, sure.

30:57.689 --> 30:58.648
No, I really do.

30:58.731 --> 31:01.609
A couple of months
before I moved out to L.A.,

31:01.693 --> 31:04.445
my father committed suicide.

31:09.826 --> 31:11.452
(exhales sharply)

31:11.536 --> 31:12.829
I'm sorry.

31:14.664 --> 31:16.124
You're scared, huh?

31:17.709 --> 31:18.960
Yeah.

31:19.043 --> 31:20.628
Me, too.

31:22.338 --> 31:23.965
Listen, why don't you come
with me?

31:24.048 --> 31:25.341
I want to show you something.

31:25.425 --> 31:26.426
Look, I'm really not

31:26.509 --> 31:30.471
in the mood to go anywhere
or see anyone right now.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.640
Do this for me.

31:34.058 --> 31:35.602
{\an1}Come on.
Get your jacket.

31:35.685 --> 31:37.729
{\an1}I'll take you
for a ride.

31:37.812 --> 31:39.105
Come on.

32:00.918 --> 32:03.046
{\an1}(sighs):
So what now?

32:05.923 --> 32:07.675
{\an3}Did you know they have
a mouse problem

32:07.759 --> 32:09.636
at the Peach Pit?

32:09.719 --> 32:10.720
{\an1}What?

32:10.803 --> 32:12.972
Yeah, Nat's going crazy.

32:13.056 --> 32:14.682
They keep setting traps,

32:14.766 --> 32:17.060
but the mouse keeps
stealing the cheese.

32:17.143 --> 32:17.977
Isn't that a riot?

32:18.061 --> 32:19.312
That's hysterical.

32:19.395 --> 32:22.690
{\an3}I kinda feel sorry
for the mouse, though.

32:22.774 --> 32:25.693
{\an1}Look, Val, I really
don't care, okay?

32:25.777 --> 32:27.070
{\an1}I don't care
about the Peach Pit.

32:27.153 --> 32:28.237
I don't care about mice.

32:28.321 --> 32:30.239
I don't care about anything
right now.

32:30.323 --> 32:32.200
What are we doing here?

32:34.452 --> 32:35.495
You'll see.

32:44.796 --> 32:47.715
{\an3}I found this place the first
week I was here in L.A.

32:47.799 --> 32:51.886
Yeah, it's a great view.

32:51.969 --> 32:55.598
{\an3}The view's not what
I come here for.

33:04.607 --> 33:05.525
You coming?

33:05.608 --> 33:07.026
{\an3}Would you get
back over here?

33:07.110 --> 33:08.361
There's slides all the time.

33:08.444 --> 33:09.195
That's right.

33:09.278 --> 33:11.072
The bottom can fall out
from under you

33:11.155 --> 33:13.574
without any warning at all.

33:15.118 --> 33:16.994
Just like life.

33:28.965 --> 33:30.800
(car horn blaring)

33:33.511 --> 33:35.221
Scared?

33:37.306 --> 33:40.435
Yeah, I'm scared.

33:40.518 --> 33:43.229
If you want to end it...

33:43.312 --> 33:45.106
here's your chance.

33:45.189 --> 33:46.441
If you want to
jump, go ahead.

33:46.524 --> 33:48.860
I won't stop you.

33:56.659 --> 33:58.745
What's the matter?

33:58.828 --> 34:02.290
Scared to die...

34:02.373 --> 34:05.293
(sniffling):
...or scared to live?

34:05.376 --> 34:07.628
{\an3}You know when the
demons get too close,

34:07.712 --> 34:10.922
the ones that say that I'm going
to end up like my father,

34:11.007 --> 34:14.177
{\an3}I come here for
a gut check.

34:22.726 --> 34:25.313
I don't want to die.

34:32.862 --> 34:34.864
I know.

34:48.668 --> 34:52.047
Toni, this was a perfect
end to a perfect evening.

34:52.130 --> 34:53.216
{\an3}Thank you.

34:53.299 --> 34:54.717
{\an3}I just wish Ray
could've made it.

34:54.801 --> 34:55.927
Well, he tried.

34:56.010 --> 34:56.886
{\an3}Just got
too late.

34:56.969 --> 34:58.846
{\an1}It is late.
We should get going.

35:01.098 --> 35:03.851
Hey, Nat, could we get
a check over here, please.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.603
{\an1}Yeah, I'll split that
with you, chief,

35:05.686 --> 35:07.313
although I'm not even sure

35:07.396 --> 35:08.439
exactly why I showed up.

35:08.523 --> 35:10.900
{\an1}Believe me, it wasn't exactly
a cakewalk for me either.

35:10.983 --> 35:13.194
{\an3}Then why don't you
do something about it.

35:13.277 --> 35:14.654
Tell Toni the truth.

35:14.737 --> 35:16.906
{\an4}I'm going to.
I'm just waiting
for the right time.

35:16.989 --> 35:20.409
{\an3}Would that be before or after
she falls in love with you?

35:21.410 --> 35:22.328
(loud snap)

35:22.411 --> 35:25.164
Willie, check the trap.

35:25.248 --> 35:26.582
I think we got him.

35:28.793 --> 35:29.752
{\an3}No luck.

35:29.836 --> 35:30.711
You little rat.

35:30.795 --> 35:33.089
{\an1}I'm gonna smash him when
I get my hands on him.

35:33.172 --> 35:34.340
Nat, Nat, Nat.

35:34.423 --> 35:36.425
You're handliI am?is all wrong.

35:36.509 --> 35:37.760
Why, Donna?

35:37.844 --> 35:39.720
{\an1}You got a better
mousetrap?

35:39.804 --> 35:41.389
As a matter of fact I do.

35:41.472 --> 35:42.473
Perhaps you guys should
stand back.

35:42.557 --> 35:45.351
I think I saw him go over
here behind the jukebox.

35:45.434 --> 35:46.894
{\an1}NAT:
What are you gonna do?

35:46.978 --> 35:50.147
Oh, it's very, very scientific.

35:51.315 --> 35:52.567
Come here, mousie.

35:52.650 --> 35:54.026
(tapping)

35:54.110 --> 35:56.779
squeaking)

35:56.863 --> 35:59.574
Come here, yeah.

35:59.657 --> 36:01.701
Is this the little mouse

36:01.784 --> 36:02.994
{\an3}you guys were
scared of?

36:04.120 --> 36:05.913
Get him out of here!

36:05.997 --> 36:08.499
Bye-bye, Mr. Mouse.
Have a nice life.

36:10.668 --> 36:12.378
Good night, guys.

36:12.461 --> 36:13.421
Good night, Don.

36:13.504 --> 36:16.382
{\an1}You sure got a way with
the critters, I'll tell you.

36:16.465 --> 36:17.466
{\an1}NAT:
Good night, Donna.

36:17.550 --> 36:18.593
You're my hero.

36:18.676 --> 36:20.428
{\an3}Bye, guys.

36:20.511 --> 36:21.804
{\an3}BOTH:
Bye, Donna.

36:21.888 --> 36:26.100
{\an3}And you're
my hero, Nat.

36:26.183 --> 36:27.977
{\an1}Don't you get
any ideas, Willie.

36:28.060 --> 36:29.562
(laughing)

36:33.190 --> 36:34.775
STEVE:
<i>Well, there you go.</i>

36:34.859 --> 36:36.444
Door to door service.

36:36.527 --> 36:38.779
Thanks.

36:38.863 --> 36:41.616
I had a really
good time tonight.

36:41.699 --> 36:43.784
Who would have thought?

36:43.868 --> 36:45.953
{\an3}Well, lots of
women actually.

36:46.037 --> 36:48.956
{\an3}Not that I want to pat
myself on the back.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.584
{\an1}I'll do it for you,
Steve. You're a stud.

36:51.667 --> 36:53.961
You know, Clare, I'm not
just another dumb blonde.

36:54.045 --> 36:55.463
{\an1}I know.

36:55.546 --> 36:58.132
And just because you're not
that great in math,

36:58.215 --> 36:59.467
doesn't mean you're not smart.

36:59.550 --> 37:02.428
I'm not that great
at English, either.

37:02.511 --> 37:05.097
I can tutor you in any
subject you want, Steve.

37:05.181 --> 37:07.850
Except one.

37:15.816 --> 37:17.485
A-plus.

37:29.288 --> 37:30.665
So, what do I say to her?

37:30.748 --> 37:33.668
You know what
to say to her.

37:33.751 --> 37:35.503
I'm nervous, okay?

37:35.586 --> 37:37.171
Don't be.

37:37.254 --> 37:39.215
She's your mother.

37:39.298 --> 37:42.218
What if I can't get
through to her?

37:42.301 --> 37:46.138
{\an3}Just tell her what
we talked about.

37:46.222 --> 37:50.268
All the things I didn't get
the chance to tell my dad.

37:50.351 --> 37:54.313
What about the, uh,
shock treatment stuff?

37:54.397 --> 37:55.523
I don't know.

37:55.606 --> 37:58.234
{\an3}Let the doctors
worry about that.

37:58.317 --> 38:01.570
You just worry about her
heart, not her head.

38:03.614 --> 38:06.075
Uh, thanks a lot
for everything.

38:06.158 --> 38:08.494
I don't know what I would
have done tonight

38:08.577 --> 38:10.871
if you hadn't come to drag me
out of the house.

38:10.955 --> 38:12.665
{\an3}Well, you're a crazy
person, David.

38:14.083 --> 38:16.836
It takes one to know one.

38:20.089 --> 38:22.258
Now go on in there.

38:48.909 --> 38:49.910
Hey, Mom.

38:53.998 --> 38:55.750
(sighs)

38:55.833 --> 39:00.046
Look, I know you don't want
to talk to me right now

39:00.129 --> 39:01.422
and that's fine,

39:01.505 --> 39:03.591
because you don't have
to look at me

39:03.674 --> 39:05.176
for me to talk to you.

39:09.638 --> 39:12.850
I know you're going through
a lot right now

39:12.933 --> 39:15.770
and believe me, I know
it's not your fault,

39:15.853 --> 39:18.606
{\an1}but I got to tell
you something.

39:18.689 --> 39:20.941
I want you to live.

39:21.025 --> 39:24.236
{\an1}It's real
important to me.

39:24.320 --> 39:27.448
We've got a lot
to look forward to.

39:27.531 --> 39:29.116
I mean, think about it.

39:29.200 --> 39:32.119
Someday, I'll be married
and have kids,

39:32.203 --> 39:34.872
and you'll be a grandmother.

39:36.874 --> 39:41.420
You got to get better for us
to share those things together.

39:49.011 --> 39:54.475
{\an1}Dad told me what...
what they want to do to you.

39:54.558 --> 39:56.769
And I know it
sounds scary,

39:56.852 --> 39:58.521
{\an1}but the doctor thinks
there's a real good chance

39:58.604 --> 39:59.814
it could make you better.

39:59.897 --> 40:02.691
Mom, you've got to give
it a chance...

40:02.775 --> 40:04.777
please.

40:07.905 --> 40:08.864
Do it for me.

40:08.948 --> 40:10.491
Do it for us.

40:17.206 --> 40:19.291
Give me your hand.

40:33.055 --> 40:34.849
Will you be there
when I wake up?

40:34.932 --> 40:37.685
{\an3}I want your face to be
the first one that I see.

40:37.768 --> 40:39.019
Yeah, I'll be here.

40:39.103 --> 40:41.647
Good.

40:41.730 --> 40:45.025
Now you better go home
and get some sleep.

40:45.109 --> 40:47.069
You look as if you could use it.

40:50.072 --> 40:52.199
Good night, Mom.

40:56.203 --> 40:58.164
Good night, David.

41:07.923 --> 41:09.717
{\an5}COLIN:
<i>You looked like</i>
<i>a million bucks tonight.</i>

41:09.800 --> 41:12.219
Really? You think so?

41:12.303 --> 41:13.762
Come on.

41:13.846 --> 41:15.514
I swear I saw Dylan
and Brandon's eyes

41:15.598 --> 41:17.600
pop out of their heads.

41:17.683 --> 41:20.561
Well, as it turns out,

41:20.644 --> 41:24.231
{\an3}I'm much more interested
in what you think.

41:24.315 --> 41:28.235
Well, I think...

41:28.319 --> 41:30.237
I love you.

41:38.329 --> 41:41.081
Stay the night?

41:41.165 --> 41:43.375
I brought my toothbrush.

41:53.510 --> 41:55.429
CINDY:
<i>"Dear Valerie,</i>

41:55.512 --> 41:58.390
"Jim and I are so sorry to hear
that you're having to go through

41:58.474 --> 42:00.809
"all those horrible
memories again.

42:00.893 --> 42:02.811
"I pray that as
the years go by,

42:02.895 --> 42:05.231
"your recollections
of the past will soften.

42:05.314 --> 42:07.942
"I can assure you,
you're not just a survivor,

42:08.025 --> 42:09.401
"you're a fighter.

42:09.485 --> 42:11.153
"And as you grow older,

42:11.237 --> 42:13.280
"those things that tear
at your soul

42:13.364 --> 42:16.450
"will make you a stronger
and more loving person.

42:16.533 --> 42:18.827
Best to you and Brandon,
Love(door opening)."

42:20.246 --> 42:21.372
Hey, Val.

42:21.455 --> 42:22.414
Hey, how did it go?

42:22.498 --> 42:24.083
You missed a great party.

42:25.376 --> 42:28.254
I didn't mean the party--

42:28.337 --> 42:29.421
I meant Susan.

42:29.505 --> 42:30.923
(chuckles)

42:31.006 --> 42:32.424
Good.

42:32.508 --> 42:34.969
So, that's all the dirt
I'm gonna get, huh?

42:35.052 --> 42:37.429
What can I say, I'm a gentleman.

42:37.513 --> 42:38.639
{\an3}Well, your mom
raised you right.

42:38.722 --> 42:41.475
You know, she's
a very wise woman.

42:41.558 --> 42:43.602
She had her moments.

42:45.896 --> 42:47.815
Well, I'm tired.

42:47.898 --> 42:48.983
{\an1}Hey Val,

42:49.066 --> 42:50.484
you going to be okay?

42:50.567 --> 42:53.279
Yeah.

42:53.362 --> 42:55.281
I may actually
get some sleep tonight.

42:57.533 --> 42:58.867
Good night.

42:58.951 --> 43:00.411
Good night.

43:04.707 --> 43:07.668
(moaning)

43:14.758 --> 43:17.678
(indistinct whispers)

43:20.973 --> 43:23.517
(whispers grow louder)

43:35.779 --> 43:39.616
You don't have
to be afraid anymore.
