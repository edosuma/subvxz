02:31.401 --> 02:34.488
<i>Friendship between Austria</i>
<i>and France...</i>

02:34.488 --> 02:36.907
<i>...must be cemented by marriage.</i>

02:36.990 --> 02:40.661
<i>My youngest daughter, Antoine...</i>

02:40.744 --> 02:43.914
<i>...will be queen of France.</i>

02:59.513 --> 03:00.764
Mops.

03:29.543 --> 03:34.131
The court of France
is not like Vienna.

03:34.131 --> 03:39.469
Listen closely to
Ambassador Mercy's council.

03:39.469 --> 03:42.890
All eyes will be on you.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.779
Look.

04:41.406 --> 04:42.950
Do you like him?

04:43.200 --> 04:45.160
He has kind eyes.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.828
He's definitely very French.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.999
- Three. Four.
- Six.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.522
Are we there yet?

05:55.647 --> 05:59.526
Yes, we have arrived at Schüttern for
the official handover.

05:59.526 --> 06:04.531
Then you will be presented to the king
and to your fiancé, Louis Auguste.

06:11.914 --> 06:15.250
Your Royal Highness, may I present
your mistress of the household...

06:15.375 --> 06:16.710
...Comtesse de Noailles.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.004
Your Royal Highness.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.597
Madame.

06:39.650 --> 06:42.069
This structure for
the handover ceremony...

06:42.152 --> 06:46.740
...has been built precisely astride
the borders of the two great lands.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.576
You have entered on Austrian soil...

06:49.660 --> 06:54.456
...you will exit on French
as the dauphine of France.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.918
Now you must bid farewell
to your party...

06:58.001 --> 07:00.838
...and leave all of Austria behind.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.596
Goodbye.

07:26.029 --> 07:27.948
Mops.

07:30.033 --> 07:33.537
You can have as many
French dogs as you like.

07:45.549 --> 07:46.800
It is a custom...

07:47.009 --> 07:52.973
...that the bride retain nothing
belonging to a foreign court.

07:52.848 --> 07:57.019
An etiquette always observed
on such an occasion.

09:01.458 --> 09:05.420
You're lucky.
Apparently she's quite beautiful.

09:07.214 --> 09:10.968
I'll probably end up with someone
who looks like a dog.

09:10.968 --> 09:13.554
- Or a horse.
- Or a horse.

09:13.637 --> 09:16.056
I've heard she's really nice.

09:16.139 --> 09:19.309
- Think they got rabbits here?
- Maybe.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.732
Come on.

09:26.984 --> 09:30.320
You notice anything strange
about me lately?

09:33.156 --> 09:34.616
It's so muddy here.

09:34.825 --> 09:37.536
I know. My stomach feels
a little bit sick.

09:37.536 --> 09:40.998
Are you feeling better now?
Are you feeling better, Camille?

09:41.081 --> 09:45.169
- I wonder if our little doggie is sick.
- Feel a little sickly.

09:45.169 --> 09:47.004
Now.

09:47.546 --> 09:51.008
Oh, my goodness, it's so
uncomfortable underfoot.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.968
Come on.

09:57.347 --> 09:59.224
There we are.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.379
How is her bosom?

10:29.463 --> 10:32.799
I have not looked at the archduchess's
bosom, Your Majesty.

10:32.883 --> 10:36.553
Oh, didn't you?
It's the first thing I look at.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.332
The Duc de Choiseul.

11:05.666 --> 11:08.335
The foreign minister
who was instrumental in this union.

11:08.335 --> 11:12.631
I shall never forget that you were
responsible for my happiness.

11:12.756 --> 11:14.925
And that of France.

11:15.259 --> 11:16.677
Please.

11:30.274 --> 11:32.776
Here comes the Austrian.

11:33.777 --> 11:37.030
I hope you like apple strudel.

11:44.204 --> 11:48.292
May I present Madame la Dauphine,
Marie Antoinette.

11:51.128 --> 11:53.297
My dear grandfather king.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.425
Welcome, madame.

12:08.937 --> 12:14.151
Let me present my grandson,
Louis Auguste.

12:26.580 --> 12:27.998
Welcome, madame.

12:48.352 --> 12:51.355
She looks like a child.

14:05.721 --> 14:07.181
Hello.

14:07.264 --> 14:08.765
Thank you.

14:09.892 --> 14:12.936
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, madame.

14:18.108 --> 14:19.902
Thanks.

15:26.635 --> 15:28.095
Hello.

18:30.694 --> 18:32.237
Amen.

20:55.297 --> 20:58.926
To the dauphin
and dauphine of France.

20:58.926 --> 21:01.970
May you have many
healthy children...

21:02.095 --> 21:05.432
...and produce an heir to our throne.

22:26.221 --> 22:27.472
Good luck.

22:27.598 --> 22:30.392
And good work.

22:41.111 --> 22:46.033
Apparently, nothing happened,
Your Majesty.

22:46.033 --> 22:47.910
Nothing?

22:50.120 --> 22:53.332
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

22:53.457 --> 22:55.292
Oh, dear.

23:09.890 --> 23:11.558
Madame...

23:11.683 --> 23:13.894
...at the morning
dressing ceremony...

23:13.977 --> 23:17.314
...rights of entry are given
to members of the high court.

23:17.523 --> 23:21.568
Major rights to princesses of the blood
and mistresses of the household...

23:22.236 --> 23:27.115
...while minor rights
to the valets and charges.

23:36.708 --> 23:39.753
Anyone with rights of entry
may enter at any time...

23:39.837 --> 23:46.426
...so you must pay attention to
acknowledging properly each arrival.

23:48.262 --> 23:49.930
And you must not
reach for anything...

23:50.180 --> 23:53.517
...for the handing of an item
to the dauphine is a guarded privilege.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.477
Must go to the highest rank
in the room.

23:55.602 --> 23:57.563
For example,
the Princesse de Lamballe...

23:57.771 --> 24:00.691
...is a princess of the blood
by marriage.

24:03.193 --> 24:04.862
Madame.

24:16.456 --> 24:18.125
Thank you.

24:19.960 --> 24:23.213
- It's cold.
- Yes.

24:24.256 --> 24:25.716
Good morning.

24:27.467 --> 24:31.138
So now the position must go
to the Duchess of Char...

24:31.221 --> 24:34.558
...because she is also
a princess of the blood.

24:47.070 --> 24:48.864
Hello.

24:49.990 --> 24:52.910
So now, as a member
of the royal family...

24:53.035 --> 24:56.788
...your sister-in-law, the Comtesse de
Provence, must have the honor.

25:22.856 --> 25:25.275
This is ridiculous.

25:25.359 --> 25:29.738
This, madame, is Versailles.

27:02.331 --> 27:05.459
So I've heard you make keys
as a hobby?

27:05.542 --> 27:07.044
Yes.

27:11.715 --> 27:14.718
And you enjoy making keys?

27:15.802 --> 27:17.471
Obviously.

27:59.054 --> 27:59.763
She had to let her servants go.
My maid knows the cook.

28:03.225 --> 28:04.893
You know everyone.

28:05.018 --> 28:08.772
Comtesse de Noailles
looks very out of sorts.

28:08.856 --> 28:11.859
I think her husband's been
causing a little problem lately...

28:11.984 --> 28:15.737
...spending far too much time
with his stable boys.

28:16.280 --> 28:17.948
Too much.

28:18.115 --> 28:21.577
Marie Antoinette looks
very pretty tonight.

28:23.036 --> 28:24.288
Yes.

28:24.371 --> 28:28.667
Darling, a new life, unfortunately.

28:29.084 --> 28:33.463
When you think about it,
this poor Marie Antoinette.

28:33.463 --> 28:35.966
So young, so...

28:36.049 --> 28:38.677
I think she should
go back to her country.

28:41.597 --> 28:43.056
Look at her, so disgusting.

28:43.265 --> 28:46.476
The comtesse is looking rather
dour this evening, don't you think?

28:46.476 --> 28:48.812
Always dour. Always tragic.

28:48.896 --> 28:51.607
Can't believe they've brought
those ghastly aunts out again.

28:51.815 --> 28:53.901
Where have they been
hiding them all these years?

28:55.360 --> 28:58.906
Oh, really? This is shocking.

29:00.574 --> 29:02.576
What is she...?

29:03.827 --> 29:05.996
It's so awful, I can't--
Oh, my goodness.

29:07.039 --> 29:09.333
Who is she?

29:11.752 --> 29:17.174
That lady is here
to give pleasure to the king.

29:20.260 --> 29:23.722
That's du Barry, the king's mistress.

29:24.139 --> 29:25.682
She wouldn't be allowed at court...

29:25.807 --> 29:28.727
...but the king did some maneuvering
to secure her a title.

29:28.852 --> 29:32.064
The one thing I've learned
about girls from the gutter...

29:32.189 --> 29:33.732
...is they know their jewels.

29:33.857 --> 29:36.443
No way are those fake.

29:38.320 --> 29:39.988
You see that?

29:40.197 --> 29:42.074
Is this the way
people are treating me?

29:42.908 --> 29:44.451
To the stocks.

29:44.701 --> 29:46.870
Nobody treats me like a lady here.

29:46.954 --> 29:49.790
Now she's staring at me.
It's so awful.

29:50.415 --> 29:53.335
- She should not be sitting at this table.
- I'll have one of--

29:57.089 --> 29:58.966
Did you hear that?

29:59.591 --> 30:03.136
- She just burped.
- Out of the whorehouse, darling.

30:03.136 --> 30:07.099
- I don't know who you're referring to.
- Everyone at this table is for sale.

30:07.224 --> 30:08.642
- Curls.
- What a little tart.

30:08.767 --> 30:12.104
Well, she's not the only one at this
table, darling. Take a look around.

30:12.104 --> 30:15.440
Look at this beautiful
Marie Antoinette. I look like her?

30:15.566 --> 30:17.818
- Don't you think so?
- A long time ago.

30:17.943 --> 30:21.905
Oh, you exaggerate.
She has blue eyes like me.

30:21.905 --> 30:24.408
I suppose she's rather sweet.
For an Austrian.

30:24.491 --> 30:27.327
I think she's delightful.
She looks like a piece of cake.

30:27.411 --> 30:30.247
Be interesting to see
how long she lasts.

30:41.425 --> 30:44.219
Good afternoon, Your Majesty.

30:46.513 --> 30:48.390
How is your grandson, the dauphin?

30:48.599 --> 30:51.310
He's off hunting the stag.

30:53.812 --> 30:56.607
<i>She doesn't seem</i>
<i>the least bit interested in him.</i>

30:56.607 --> 31:00.068
<i>She is Austrian. They're not exactly</i>
<i>the warmest people.</i>

31:00.194 --> 31:03.530
<i>But it's true. Her brother Joseph</i>
<i>is so cold. He's an awful man.</i>

31:03.614 --> 31:07.701
<i>They say in Austria,</i>
<i>that she was with child...</i>

31:13.624 --> 31:16.543
What a hunt today.

31:21.632 --> 31:23.717
I'm exhausted.

32:18.272 --> 32:20.274
Would you like some meat?

32:26.947 --> 32:28.782
<i>Your Royal Highness...</i>

32:29.032 --> 32:32.870
...handing out cold meats
to a hunting party...

32:32.870 --> 32:35.873
...is not the most becoming conduct
for a future queen of France.

32:35.998 --> 32:39.209
I was just trying to be a nice wife
for the dauphin's hunt.

32:39.209 --> 32:40.586
Surely there's no harm in that.

32:40.794 --> 32:44.631
And I received a letter from
your mother warning you not to ride...

32:44.631 --> 32:47.134
...as this is one of
the leading causes of miscarriages.

32:47.259 --> 32:51.430
Well, as everyone knows,
there's no danger of that.

32:52.389 --> 32:53.640
And it's not my fault.

32:53.807 --> 32:57.895
Do you realize the consequences of
an unconsummated royal marriage?

32:57.895 --> 32:59.980
That it could be annulled?

33:00.063 --> 33:03.400
Your mother has asked that
you take this matter very seriously.

33:03.525 --> 33:07.154
And do everything
in your power...

33:08.530 --> 33:10.490
...to inspire the dauphin.

33:11.867 --> 33:14.161
I'll do what I can.

33:14.244 --> 33:17.497
Of course I want to please
the dauphin and my mother.

33:17.706 --> 33:21.043
You'll have no influence over the king
and dauphin without a pregnancy.

33:21.043 --> 33:23.962
Madame, you have
the alliance to consider.

33:24.087 --> 33:27.508
Letting everyone down
would be my greatest unhappiness.

33:28.759 --> 33:32.179
I am pleased madame
is taking this seriously.

33:35.641 --> 33:37.184
Oh, is Mops on his way?

33:38.018 --> 33:40.437
I'm working on it...

33:40.521 --> 33:45.442
...but Your Royal Highness has
more pressing matters to attend to.

33:47.528 --> 33:51.782
Oh, and I received this letter
from your mother.

34:01.625 --> 34:03.043
<i>Dearest Antoinette:</i>

34:03.168 --> 34:07.464
<i>It is clear that the heart</i>
<i>of your problems in your new home...</i>

34:07.464 --> 34:13.469
<i>...is your inability to inspire</i>
<i>sexual passion in your husband.</i>

34:13.469 --> 34:18.391
<i>There is no reason a girl</i>
<i>with so many charms as you...</i>

34:18.391 --> 34:21.311
<i>...should be in this situation.</i>

34:21.395 --> 34:25.274
<i>Remember, you represent</i>
<i>the future...</i>

34:25.274 --> 34:28.819
<i>...and nothing is certain</i>
<i>about your place there...</i>

34:28.902 --> 34:34.449
<i>...until the final physical act to crown</i>
<i>the Franco-Austrian alliance...</i>

34:34.324 --> 34:36.659
<i>...is performed.</i>

35:13.113 --> 35:15.115
It's cold.

35:15.199 --> 35:17.409
It is a bit chilly.
Shall I get you a blanket?

35:17.534 --> 35:20.537
No. It's okay.

35:27.294 --> 35:30.756
Are those your feet?
They're like icicles.

35:37.012 --> 35:38.555
Well...

35:41.808 --> 35:43.560
...sleep well.

35:46.813 --> 35:48.482
Thank you.

35:51.902 --> 35:54.530
- Night.
- Good night.

36:39.575 --> 36:41.451
Your hair always looks so pretty.

36:41.535 --> 36:43.620
- Oh, do you think so?
- Yeah, it's gorgeous.

36:43.871 --> 36:46.540
- It's not what I'm used to. It is.
- It's so nice to be blond.

36:46.540 --> 36:48.458
- Have you been to see Léonard?
- No.

36:48.625 --> 36:50.627
My head is in agony.

36:50.711 --> 36:53.881
- This morning, I think, you know--
- Did he pull it?

36:53.881 --> 36:55.632
Léonard must've been
in a bad mood...

36:55.841 --> 36:58.635
...because he was pulling
my hair so hard.

36:58.760 --> 37:02.931
And I want to tell him, you know, it's
not my fault if he's had a bad morning.

37:02.931 --> 37:05.434
Don't take it out on my scalp.

37:12.816 --> 37:14.818
That was unnecessary.

37:15.861 --> 37:17.321
Watch it.

37:37.758 --> 37:39.927
I would love to go
to the opera in Paris.

37:40.052 --> 37:42.971
Why go to the opera when we can
listen to the comtesse here?

37:42.971 --> 37:45.599
Must she sing all night?

37:48.936 --> 37:51.021
Can't you do something
about your wife?

37:53.398 --> 37:57.152
Madame, shall we retire
to make love all night?

37:59.446 --> 38:01.198
Four times last night wasn't enough.

38:14.878 --> 38:17.381
Dear Antoinette:

38:18.549 --> 38:23.554
I am extremely concerned
with your situation.

38:24.972 --> 38:30.394
Fortunately, the king doesn't show
preference for your sister-in-law.

38:30.394 --> 38:35.941
But what if she becomes pregnant?

38:35.941 --> 38:39.278
<i>Also, I have heard...</i>

38:39.278 --> 38:43.657
<i>...that you are not making</i>
<i>invitations to Madame du Barry.</i>

38:45.117 --> 38:50.122
<i>Snubbing the king's favorite,</i>
<i>in your position...</i>

38:50.122 --> 38:56.253
<i>...is extremely unwise.</i>

38:58.881 --> 39:00.549
- Du Barry is dreadful.
- Dreadful.

39:00.757 --> 39:03.343
The way she dresses.
She thinks she is the queen.

39:03.468 --> 39:07.014
Yes, she does.
And those ridiculous pet monkeys.

39:07.014 --> 39:08.265
Where does she come from?

39:08.473 --> 39:10.767
From every bed in Paris.

39:10.851 --> 39:14.313
You know, we didn't think she'd
last long until she married the comte...

39:14.313 --> 39:17.024
...and then he was conveniently
shipped away somewhere.

39:17.107 --> 39:18.692
She doesn't stay in the boudoir.

39:18.775 --> 39:20.027
- She's political.
- Very.

39:20.277 --> 39:22.529
And extremely anti-Choiseul.

39:22.654 --> 39:24.198
And I don't want to say this...

39:24.323 --> 39:27.117
...but I don't think that she has
greeted you with respect.

39:27.242 --> 39:28.911
That's just my opinion.

39:29.119 --> 39:31.830
Ambassador Mercy says
I must pay her a visit.

39:31.955 --> 39:34.458
Well, if we invited you to tea
at the last minute...

39:34.541 --> 39:37.044
...you wouldn't be able to,
would you?

39:40.464 --> 39:44.051
She died giving birth
to her tenth child.

39:44.134 --> 39:46.428
What a pity. What a pity.

39:46.553 --> 39:49.223
- There was blood all over--
- Here comes our little Austrian.

39:49.348 --> 39:51.642
- Good afternoon, madame.
- Good afternoon.

39:51.725 --> 39:53.310
Good afternoon. You look lovely.

39:53.393 --> 39:55.312
Oh, thank you. So do you.

39:55.395 --> 39:56.730
Thank you.

39:57.064 --> 39:59.650
Look at du Barry.
What is she wearing now?

39:59.775 --> 40:02.152
Another one of her exotic fantasies?

40:02.277 --> 40:05.197
She can't pass a mirror
without seducing it.

40:05.197 --> 40:07.699
Do you think she's wearing
enough jewelry?

40:08.742 --> 40:10.202
Never enough for du Barry.

40:10.327 --> 40:12.412
She's coming.

40:14.581 --> 40:16.333
Oh, I love your shoes, Victoire.

40:16.458 --> 40:18.961
Oh, why, thank you.
I got them from Christian in Paris.

40:19.086 --> 40:22.297
- Oh, I must call on him.
- Yes, you must. He's wonderful.

41:13.473 --> 41:18.395
Madame du Barry would like
to offer you some diamonds.

41:19.021 --> 41:21.648
I have enough diamonds.

41:21.732 --> 41:25.903
Snubbing the king's favorite is publicly
criticizing the king's behavior.

41:25.903 --> 41:28.071
All you need do is say
a few words to her.

41:28.197 --> 41:30.490
Because of rank she is not
allowed to speak first.

41:30.574 --> 41:32.492
I certainly have nothing
to say to her.

41:32.659 --> 41:35.078
Why should I approve of his
cavorting with a harlot?

41:35.162 --> 41:37.915
- Your Royal Highness.
- Well, that's what she is.

41:37.998 --> 41:41.335
Everyone knows she's from a brothel
and that title was bought for her.

41:41.418 --> 41:44.463
Your mother and I
are very concerned.

41:44.588 --> 41:48.091
Du Barry has been complaining to
the king that you will not address her.

41:48.091 --> 41:50.719
And you cannot afford
to fall out of favor with the king.

41:50.844 --> 41:53.013
Especially as your marriage...

41:53.639 --> 41:56.016
...not exactly on solid ground.

41:57.601 --> 41:59.895
Fine. I'll talk to her.

42:22.626 --> 42:25.212
There are a lot of people
at Versailles today.

42:26.046 --> 42:27.965
Yes, there are.

42:57.160 --> 43:00.581
Those are my last words
to that woman.

43:16.847 --> 43:21.018
The first mechanical locks
were made of wood.

43:26.231 --> 43:31.778
Records show them in use
some 4000 years ago in Egypt.

44:13.070 --> 44:15.989
Any good fans? That one's pretty.

44:16.073 --> 44:17.824
- Evening or daytime?
- I like lace.

44:19.493 --> 44:22.120
These are so du Barry.

44:22.329 --> 44:26.166
- Do you like these for hair?
- It's beautiful.

44:26.291 --> 44:28.377
- You don't think it's too much?
- Maybe one.

44:28.502 --> 44:30.671
- One feather?
- Yeah.

44:30.754 --> 44:32.005
Or in white?

44:32.130 --> 44:34.633
Can we get these in white, maybe?

44:34.758 --> 44:36.301
I don't know if I like that one.

44:37.261 --> 44:39.346
I love these.

44:39.429 --> 44:41.181
Do you want these too?

44:41.431 --> 44:42.766
Yeah, but in pink.

44:42.850 --> 44:45.894
Oh, okay. Two in pink.

44:46.019 --> 44:48.939
Has madame read the brief
on our current situation?

44:49.022 --> 44:51.316
No, I haven't read it yet.

44:51.441 --> 44:53.944
Can you just tell me about it?

44:55.362 --> 45:00.492
Well, the reforms in Poland by King
Poniatowski have led to civil war.

45:00.617 --> 45:04.037
The Russians and the Austrians
have taken over a third of Poland...

45:04.037 --> 45:06.039
...which is, of course, distressing...

45:06.206 --> 45:09.376
...as Poland is a friend and ally
of France.

45:11.545 --> 45:15.299
Which sleeve do you like?
With ruffles or without?

45:16.341 --> 45:18.427
Have you been paying
any attention?

45:18.552 --> 45:22.598
Your mother is relying on you
to smooth over this crisis.

45:22.723 --> 45:25.642
Where will I be if there's a rupture
between our two families?

45:26.977 --> 45:30.105
Am I to be Austrian
or the dauphine of France?

45:32.399 --> 45:33.859
You must be both.

45:38.447 --> 45:41.783
- <i>Well, I heard that she bought a boy.</i>
- <i>No.</i>

45:41.909 --> 45:45.537
<i>Yes, I heard. She found a peasant</i>
<i>boy by the side of the street...</i>

45:45.537 --> 45:47.748
<i>...and took him in like a stray dog.</i>

45:47.831 --> 45:50.542
Well, it's not as if
she can have one of her own.

45:50.667 --> 45:52.753
Maybe if she spent
less time with Lamballe...

45:52.836 --> 45:55.005
...and more time with her husband...

45:55.255 --> 45:57.424
...there wouldn't be a problem.

45:57.508 --> 46:00.427
Well, let's not forget
she is an Austrian spy.

46:00.427 --> 46:03.889
And I can't imagine
that's very warm in the bedroom.

46:05.432 --> 46:08.602
Come, my little truffle cake.

46:09.102 --> 46:11.271
I'm going to ravage you.

46:11.688 --> 46:14.608
- Will you come back right away?
- Yes, my sweet.

46:14.733 --> 46:17.528
Just a quick hunting excursion,
we'll be back straightaway.

46:17.528 --> 46:22.658
I will be humiliated
before the court and the public...

46:22.658 --> 46:25.702
...if your brother's new wife
becomes pregnant before I do.

46:25.786 --> 46:29.540
When I return from Saint-Cloud,
you can be sure...

46:29.540 --> 46:31.625
...that I will resume my regime.

46:31.834 --> 46:36.213
And hopefully everything
will go swimmingly.

47:14.585 --> 47:18.755
I have absolutely no intention of
breaking the alliance with Austria.

47:18.755 --> 47:21.341
I am very relieved to hear that,
Your Majesty.

47:21.466 --> 47:24.178
But what on earth is going on
with that young couple?

47:24.261 --> 47:26.180
It's a disaster.

47:26.889 --> 47:30.642
Send for Dr. Lassonne to visit them.

47:30.767 --> 47:32.728
Yes, of course.

47:35.105 --> 47:38.442
Do you find your body responsive?

47:38.442 --> 47:39.943
What?

47:40.527 --> 47:43.989
Do you find your body responsive?

47:51.496 --> 47:54.625
What do you eat for breakfast?

47:54.708 --> 47:56.293
Hot chocolate.

47:56.376 --> 47:58.587
Hot chocolate.

48:32.162 --> 48:34.164
Hello?

48:34.456 --> 48:36.959
Hello, Yolande.

48:39.878 --> 48:41.421
How lovely to see you.

48:41.672 --> 48:45.092
Yes. This is
the Duchesse de Polignac.

48:45.092 --> 48:46.760
- Hello.
- Your Majesty.

48:46.844 --> 48:48.846
- We haven't seen you for a while.
- I know.

48:49.054 --> 48:52.808
I've been in St. Petersburg,
where I met Dimitri.

48:54.268 --> 48:58.355
Isn't he divine?
Have you ever been with a Russian?

48:58.522 --> 49:00.524
- No, I--
- They're so bossy.

49:00.607 --> 49:05.320
Look how fat the marquis's gotten.
Hope he doesn't break the chair.

49:05.320 --> 49:08.532
Is he still sleeping with Camille?

49:08.657 --> 49:11.702
Anyway, I must be off.
It was lovely to meet you.

49:51.491 --> 49:52.868
Quiet.

49:52.993 --> 49:55.787
Applause is not usually permitted
at court performances.

49:55.913 --> 49:59.249
Why not? It was wonderful.

50:00.083 --> 50:01.502
Clap, clap.

50:01.627 --> 50:03.504
Clap.

51:24.418 --> 51:26.587
<i>Dearest Antoinette:</i>

51:26.712 --> 51:31.592
<i>I'm pleased to tell you how wonderful</i>
<i>your brothers and sisters are doing...</i>

51:31.592 --> 51:33.385
<i>...in their marriages.</i>

51:33.510 --> 51:36.430
<i>Maria Carolina is pregnant...</i>

51:36.597 --> 51:39.641
<i>...expecting her first child in June.</i>

51:39.766 --> 51:42.769
<i>And Ferdinand is enchanted</i>
<i>with Beatrice...</i>

51:42.853 --> 51:46.106
<i>...having made her his wife at once.</i>

51:46.106 --> 51:50.611
<i>All this news, which should fill me</i>
<i>with contentment...</i>

51:50.611 --> 51:56.200
<i>...is diminished by reflections</i>
<i>on your dangerous situation.</i>

51:56.200 --> 51:58.619
<i>Everything depends on the wife...</i>

51:58.702 --> 52:01.955
<i>...if she is willing and sweet.</i>

52:02.039 --> 52:03.957
<i>I can't repeat enough...</i>

52:04.041 --> 52:09.254
<i>...the importance for you</i>
<i>to employ charm and patience...</i>

52:09.254 --> 52:14.885
<i>...never ill humor, to remedy</i>
<i>this unfortunate situation.</i>

52:14.885 --> 52:18.138
<i>Remember, nothing is certain</i>
<i>about your place there...</i>

52:18.138 --> 52:21.558
<i>...until an heir is produced.</i>

52:45.123 --> 52:47.209
- Excuse me.
- It's all right.

53:11.191 --> 53:12.776
I'm sorry.

53:12.943 --> 53:14.611
That's all right.

53:14.736 --> 53:17.865
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

53:21.535 --> 53:24.454
- Good night.
- Good night.

53:52.399 --> 53:57.487
Your Majesties are requested at the
delivery of Comtesse de Provence.

54:07.289 --> 54:10.209
Bravo, bravo.

54:10.751 --> 54:13.962
- Oh, wonderful!
- It's a healthy baby boy.

54:14.087 --> 54:17.508
Oh, my God. How happy I am.

54:20.010 --> 54:23.347
Let me see my nephew.
The new Duc d'Angoulême.

54:25.015 --> 54:26.892
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

54:27.100 --> 54:30.354
It's the first Bourbon prince
of his generation.

54:30.646 --> 54:32.940
He's so beautiful.

54:34.816 --> 54:37.319
It's barren. What do you expect?

54:38.278 --> 54:40.864
When will you give us an heir?

54:41.907 --> 54:43.867
I hear she's frigid.

56:09.203 --> 56:11.788
I like the pink. It's like candy.

56:22.549 --> 56:25.344
This is wonderful.

56:26.303 --> 56:28.055
I love this.

56:28.889 --> 56:30.474
Oh, it's a classic.

56:41.902 --> 56:44.238
Could we get
some more champagne?

57:37.916 --> 57:39.710
Monsieur Léonard.

57:55.017 --> 57:56.393
Ravishing.

57:59.605 --> 58:01.481
Oh, Léonard.

58:01.815 --> 58:03.483
You're the best.

58:03.901 --> 58:06.987
- It's not too much, is it?
- No.

58:32.554 --> 58:35.349
We should all go to Paris
for the masked ball.

58:35.474 --> 58:38.602
We're not allowed to go
without a formal reception.

58:39.353 --> 58:41.522
Well, if it's a masked ball...

58:41.605 --> 58:44.441
...no one would have to know,
would they?

58:54.868 --> 58:56.119
Sorry.

59:22.896 --> 59:24.398
Which way?

59:27.401 --> 59:28.652
Come on.

01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:06.190
Excuse me.

01:00:06.607 --> 01:00:07.941
Excuse me.

01:00:35.385 --> 01:00:37.971
Where do you come from, monsieur?

01:00:38.388 --> 01:00:39.765
Versailles.

01:00:41.975 --> 01:00:46.980
And has the dauphin
done the deed yet?

01:00:47.981 --> 01:00:49.233
What?

01:00:49.483 --> 01:00:52.486
Has the dauphin deflowered
the dauphine?

01:00:52.569 --> 01:00:56.865
- Excuse me?
- I'd love to do the honors, you know.

01:01:24.184 --> 01:01:26.895
Doesn't interest me. Cheers.

01:01:41.368 --> 01:01:43.579
Look at that sword.

01:01:43.704 --> 01:01:46.498
I'd like to see what he could
do with that.

01:01:47.958 --> 01:01:50.127
Oh, who's he talking to?

01:01:50.252 --> 01:01:52.629
Hideous dress she's wearing.

01:02:00.888 --> 01:02:03.807
Pretend you're having
a really good time.

01:02:05.559 --> 01:02:07.060
Have fun.

01:02:09.563 --> 01:02:13.901
- Do I know you?
- No. I don't think so.

01:02:15.694 --> 01:02:18.822
Are you making
any progress with her?

01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:21.325
Possibly.

01:02:23.076 --> 01:02:24.745
Are you going to tell me
who you are?

01:02:28.081 --> 01:02:29.750
Are you?

01:02:30.083 --> 01:02:32.586
Count Fersen of the Swedish army.

01:02:34.171 --> 01:02:35.506
Count Fersen.

01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:45.015
That's the dauphine.

01:03:04.076 --> 01:03:06.286
We must go.
It's half past three in the morning.

01:03:06.370 --> 01:03:08.121
No. Let's just stay a little longer.

01:03:08.247 --> 01:03:10.749
- Oh, please. Let's go. Come on.
- Please, please.

01:03:10.874 --> 01:03:12.125
Finally.

01:03:15.963 --> 01:03:18.257
Do you know of Count Fersen?

01:03:19.383 --> 01:03:22.010
Yes! Count Fersen, of course.

01:03:22.135 --> 01:03:24.221
Beatrice de la Falaise
was with him last summer.

01:03:24.388 --> 01:03:26.056
He's got quite a reputation,
you know.

01:03:26.306 --> 01:03:28.976
Comtesse de Sevigny.
She was with him too.

01:05:14.748 --> 01:05:16.500
Good morning.

01:05:17.835 --> 01:05:20.587
- What is it?
- The king has fallen ill.

01:05:20.671 --> 01:05:22.005
Is it serious?

01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:23.507
Smallpox.

01:05:25.467 --> 01:05:27.761
He doesn't have long.

01:05:27.845 --> 01:05:33.517
You know, we cannot take his
confession while he has a mistress.

01:05:37.271 --> 01:05:39.773
It will be taken care of.

01:05:40.357 --> 01:05:42.442
Madame du Barry...

01:05:43.527 --> 01:05:47.155
...I'm sick and know
what I have to do.

01:05:48.615 --> 01:05:50.784
<i>Rest assured...</i>

01:05:51.034 --> 01:05:53.412
<i>...I shall always...</i>

01:05:53.537 --> 01:05:57.583
<i>...have the most tender feelings</i>
<i>of friendship for you.</i>

01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:29.990
Bring me du Barry.

01:06:31.783 --> 01:06:34.411
She is gone, Your Majesty.

01:06:50.135 --> 01:06:54.014
The king is dead.
Long live Louis XVI.

01:07:00.562 --> 01:07:04.316
Your Majesties,
I am at your loyal service.

01:07:14.868 --> 01:07:20.040
Dear God, guide us and protect us.
We are too young to reign.

01:07:25.712 --> 01:07:30.384
May God crown you
with a crown of glory.

01:08:20.934 --> 01:08:22.935
How marvelous.

01:08:23.770 --> 01:08:26.189
Here are two for me and the queen.

01:08:26.356 --> 01:08:28.149
Happy birthday, darling!

01:08:34.823 --> 01:08:37.451
One, two, three.

01:08:37.533 --> 01:08:40.537
Happy birthday!

01:08:50.130 --> 01:08:53.884
Happy birthday, darling.
Eighteen. Happy birthday.

01:08:59.973 --> 01:09:01.225
Big stakes! Come on now!

01:09:02.643 --> 01:09:04.310
That one.

01:09:04.728 --> 01:09:05.979
That one's for me.

01:09:07.648 --> 01:09:09.316
What's coming?

01:09:14.988 --> 01:09:16.323
Amazing.

01:09:27.251 --> 01:09:28.752
Here are two.

01:09:30.587 --> 01:09:32.589
So pretty!

01:09:43.517 --> 01:09:45.519
Oh, Léonard.

01:09:45.853 --> 01:09:47.104
Thank you.

01:09:50.314 --> 01:09:52.276
Okay, come round to the salon.

01:09:52.401 --> 01:09:54.194
Speak to le beau Julian.

01:09:54.486 --> 01:09:57.614
- First. And then you'll see me.
- Marvelous!

01:09:57.698 --> 01:09:59.491
I've heard he likes men as well.

01:09:59.616 --> 01:10:01.785
No. No. It's not true.

01:10:02.536 --> 01:10:04.288
Do you want some cherry?

01:10:06.999 --> 01:10:09.793
I love your hair.
What's going on there?

01:10:09.918 --> 01:10:11.461
Everything.

01:10:11.795 --> 01:10:14.381
- It's fantastic.
- It's full of secrets.

01:10:23.974 --> 01:10:25.767
You're winning, I hope.

01:10:28.562 --> 01:10:29.813
Madame, it's quite late.

01:10:30.063 --> 01:10:32.441
I think it's time for
the dealers to return to Paris.

01:10:32.566 --> 01:10:35.652
You said we could play
but you never specified for how long.

01:10:35.652 --> 01:10:38.488
- You're worthless.
- I won again!

01:10:39.406 --> 01:10:42.159
- Give me my chips.
- How'd you get so good at this?

01:10:42.326 --> 01:10:44.119
- Good night.
- Oh, no. Don't go to sleep.

01:10:44.244 --> 01:10:47.456
We're gonna watch the sunrise.
Don't you want to see that?

01:10:47.456 --> 01:10:49.541
I'd rather get
some much-needed sleep.

01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:52.169
Have you ever watched the sunrise?

01:10:52.461 --> 01:10:54.421
When I rise early for the hunt,
my dear.

01:10:54.671 --> 01:10:56.423
- That doesn't count.
- It's your turn.

01:10:56.507 --> 01:10:59.259
Try not to lose our whole fortune.

01:11:00.093 --> 01:11:01.762
On a roll.

01:11:06.099 --> 01:11:07.351
I'm taking off.

01:11:07.476 --> 01:11:10.187
That's impressive.
That is very impressive.

01:11:14.775 --> 01:11:16.360
Wait! Wait! Wait!

01:11:16.527 --> 01:11:18.111
Spin with me!

01:11:18.737 --> 01:11:20.113
Wait!

01:11:23.450 --> 01:11:24.868
Come along.

01:11:33.627 --> 01:11:36.880
Come on. Come on, people.
Move, move, move.

01:11:54.189 --> 01:11:58.151
Isn't that the most beautiful thing
you've ever seen?

01:12:03.156 --> 01:12:05.659
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

01:12:05.742 --> 01:12:08.078
- Cheers. For the birthday girl.
- Happy birthday.

01:12:08.579 --> 01:12:10.163
To the new day.

01:12:11.290 --> 01:12:12.749
And the next one.

01:12:13.166 --> 01:12:15.586
I think I have a fly
in my champagne.

01:13:57.437 --> 01:14:01.275
I would like to plant oaks
all along these paths.

01:14:01.275 --> 01:14:03.068
How long will that take?

01:14:03.193 --> 01:14:08.699
It will take two weeks to get them,
but they will be quite small.

01:14:10.784 --> 01:14:12.953
What if I want them that size?

01:14:13.704 --> 01:14:15.873
It will take at least three years.

01:14:15.998 --> 01:14:17.374
- Three years?
- Yes.

01:14:17.457 --> 01:14:19.459
Well, can't they bring in
bigger ones?

01:14:19.543 --> 01:14:21.420
Well, I can see.

01:14:26.008 --> 01:14:30.596
Your Majesty, you have spent
over 50,000 already this month.

01:14:31.138 --> 01:14:33.724
There is nothing left
to go to your charities.

01:14:34.057 --> 01:14:36.643
Your Majesty? Léonard is here
to fit your new wigs.

01:14:36.643 --> 01:14:39.771
All right.
I'll get the small trees.

01:14:39.897 --> 01:14:42.900
And I'll ask Louis for the money
for the Young Mothers' Fund.

01:14:49.781 --> 01:14:54.244
The Americans are asking for help
in their revolution.

01:14:55.412 --> 01:14:58.248
Well, I can't exactly see
assisting those...

01:14:58.332 --> 01:15:00.751
...who are rejecting their sovereign.

01:15:00.918 --> 01:15:04.254
But it would make
a strong statement to England.

01:15:04.796 --> 01:15:06.673
Can our finances take the strain?

01:15:06.882 --> 01:15:09.384
Oh, taxes will be raised slightly.

01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:12.513
I recommend we help
our American brothers...

01:15:12.596 --> 01:15:15.849
...and show the rest of Europe
our strength.

01:15:18.143 --> 01:15:22.523
All right, then.
Send funds to America.

01:15:42.543 --> 01:15:46.296
Madame, your brother, the emperor,
is in the salon waiting for you.

01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:48.715
He's here? Thank you.

01:15:58.892 --> 01:16:00.686
Have you come to take me home?

01:16:01.228 --> 01:16:04.231
Unfortunately, I can't kidnap
the queen of France.

01:16:04.231 --> 01:16:06.942
Is your hair quite tall enough today?

01:16:06.942 --> 01:16:10.571
Maybe you can keep a pet
in there or something.

01:16:13.198 --> 01:16:15.993
The emperor of China
sent me this tea.

01:16:17.578 --> 01:16:19.663
Watch the flower.

01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:25.711
Isn't it divine?

01:16:26.253 --> 01:16:27.671
Yes.

01:16:30.716 --> 01:16:32.259
It's jasmine.

01:16:46.273 --> 01:16:51.278
As your brother, I have to lecture you
about your constant gambling...

01:16:51.278 --> 01:16:55.199
...and choice of friends,
like the Duchesse de Polignac.

01:16:55.324 --> 01:16:58.243
Do you think she's the proper
lady-in-waiting for a queen?

01:16:58.243 --> 01:17:01.038
But she's fun. She makes me laugh.

01:17:01.163 --> 01:17:02.623
And your constant parties.

01:17:02.831 --> 01:17:05.459
I mean, they can hardly leave you
enough time to spend...

01:17:05.542 --> 01:17:07.961
...alone with your husband.

01:17:08.045 --> 01:17:10.130
I'm sure our mother has worried you.

01:17:10.756 --> 01:17:13.884
Yes. Well, of course she has.

01:17:17.429 --> 01:17:20.474
I think I'm gonna talk to young Louis.

01:17:36.198 --> 01:17:37.658
Magnificent.

01:17:43.288 --> 01:17:46.750
We have a female elephant
in our Austrian menagerie.

01:17:47.334 --> 01:17:50.170
Well, perhaps we could arrange
a marriage.

01:17:54.424 --> 01:17:56.218
So...

01:17:56.426 --> 01:18:00.180
...I thought we could have a little talk
about the marriage bed.

01:18:02.349 --> 01:18:04.560
The doctor said I was fit.

01:18:04.685 --> 01:18:06.353
Good.

01:18:06.436 --> 01:18:08.605
What goes on exactly?

01:18:15.946 --> 01:18:19.449
I understand you have
a certain passion for locks.

01:18:19.449 --> 01:18:20.951
Yes.

01:18:20.951 --> 01:18:24.288
Well, sometimes when
a key doesn't quite fit...

01:18:24.371 --> 01:18:27.708
<i>The problem is only that</i>
<i>the king and queen of France...</i>

01:18:27.791 --> 01:18:30.002
<i>...are complete blunderers.</i>

01:18:30.127 --> 01:18:33.547
<i>There's nothing really wrong</i>
<i>with Louis XVI.</i>

01:18:33.547 --> 01:18:37.801
<i>Everything works,</i>
<i>just not at the right time.</i>

01:18:37.801 --> 01:18:43.223
<i>I think after our conversation,</i>
<i>the great work will be accomplished.</i>

01:19:28.185 --> 01:19:29.853
Very warm in here.

01:19:30.270 --> 01:19:32.439
I can't even believe she's getting
enough air.

01:19:48.622 --> 01:19:50.624
Is it a boy?

01:19:52.793 --> 01:19:54.127
It's a girl, look.

01:19:54.253 --> 01:19:56.880
She's unconscious.
We must get her air.

01:19:57.047 --> 01:19:58.841
Please, the queen needs air.

01:19:58.966 --> 01:20:02.302
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:20:02.386 --> 01:20:05.097
Get back. Back.
Get back, please.

01:20:05.222 --> 01:20:06.974
Everybody, please.

01:20:07.307 --> 01:20:08.725
Get back.

01:20:21.154 --> 01:20:22.322
Oh, he's beautiful.

01:20:25.951 --> 01:20:28.161
You are adorable.

01:20:28.745 --> 01:20:30.539
It's a girl.

01:20:35.002 --> 01:20:37.337
Poor little girl.

01:20:37.421 --> 01:20:42.926
You are not what was desired,
but you are no less dear to me.

01:20:44.595 --> 01:20:47.431
A boy would be the son of France...

01:20:47.514 --> 01:20:51.602
...but you, Marie Thérèse,
shall be mine.

01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:54.730
Come look.

01:20:56.106 --> 01:20:58.483
Oh, she's so small.

01:20:59.443 --> 01:21:00.861
Look at her hands.

01:21:12.789 --> 01:21:14.541
I would like to feed her myself.

01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:17.127
But, madame,
we have the nurse for that.

01:21:17.794 --> 01:21:21.215
And you know, it's not a good idea
in your fragile condition.

01:21:23.634 --> 01:21:25.177
Madame.

01:21:32.559 --> 01:21:36.563
May I present you with
your new retreat, the Petit Trianon.

01:21:38.941 --> 01:21:40.192
Thank you.

01:22:57.644 --> 01:23:02.482
I want something
more simple. Natural.

01:23:02.983 --> 01:23:04.735
<i>To wear in the garden.</i>

01:23:17.998 --> 01:23:21.543
Are you getting food for the little lamb?
Let's feed the lamb.

01:23:21.543 --> 01:23:23.337
Marie Thérèse, come here.

01:23:25.172 --> 01:23:28.091
You do it. You do it.
You feed the lamb.

01:23:28.091 --> 01:23:29.593
You feed the lamb.

01:23:37.601 --> 01:23:39.353
Little lamby.

01:23:59.206 --> 01:24:01.166
Beautiful.

01:24:01.792 --> 01:24:04.211
What is this? It's an egg.

01:24:05.546 --> 01:24:08.966
Welcome to my little village.
I love it here.

01:24:09.091 --> 01:24:11.468
- Really special.
- It's my heaven.

01:24:13.554 --> 01:24:15.222
- Hello.
- Sweet.

01:24:15.347 --> 01:24:18.809
Oh, look, the chickens
are out. Fabulous.

01:24:19.226 --> 01:24:20.978
Oh, the lilies look so beautiful.

01:24:21.186 --> 01:24:23.897
- It's heavenly.
- Hello.

01:24:23.897 --> 01:24:26.400
Come on, you little chickens.
Come on, little chickens!

01:24:26.483 --> 01:24:28.694
Oh, look at those little things. Hello!

01:24:28.819 --> 01:24:30.362
That one's named after me.

01:24:30.571 --> 01:24:34.658
Oh, this is my favorite, all the fresh
herbs. They smell so good.

01:24:34.741 --> 01:24:38.078
You've got to brush the dirt off a bit,
but they're quite clean after that.

01:24:38.996 --> 01:24:42.666
Oh, we must do this more often.
I love the country.

01:24:45.586 --> 01:24:47.671
Where'd you get this from?

01:24:48.714 --> 01:24:52.467
- Wait till you try this milk.
- Oh, what beautiful porcelain.

01:24:52.593 --> 01:24:55.387
- How lovely.
- That one's very good.

01:24:57.890 --> 01:24:59.266
One of these.

01:25:01.018 --> 01:25:02.686
You must try the milk.

01:25:02.895 --> 01:25:04.146
Thank you.

01:25:09.443 --> 01:25:11.028
Rousseau says:

01:25:11.111 --> 01:25:15.115
"If we assume man has been
corrupted by an artificial civilization...

01:25:15.407 --> 01:25:17.367
<i>...what is the natural state?</i>

01:25:18.035 --> 01:25:20.829
<i>The state of nature</i>
<i>from which he has been removed?</i>

01:25:22.623 --> 01:25:26.460
<i>Imagine wandering up</i>
<i>and down the forest...</i>

01:25:26.543 --> 01:25:30.422
<i>...without industry, without speech...</i>

01:25:30.422 --> 01:25:32.299
<i>...and without home."</i>

01:25:51.902 --> 01:25:55.030
Let's get a blue flower.

01:26:00.661 --> 01:26:02.120
Beautiful.

01:26:17.845 --> 01:26:22.140
<i>No, I think perceived austerity</i>
<i>must be encouraged...</i>

01:26:22.140 --> 01:26:26.603
...but I'm afraid the queen has
a somewhat artistic temperament...

01:26:26.603 --> 01:26:28.272
...which needs nourishing.

01:26:28.397 --> 01:26:29.773
May I speak to you?

01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:32.276
Yes. Excuse me, Father.

01:26:33.819 --> 01:26:36.864
We have not received any invitation
by the queen...

01:26:36.947 --> 01:26:39.658
...which is customary to our rank.

01:26:39.783 --> 01:26:44.121
I'm afraid the queen is not well
enough for formal entertaining...

01:26:44.246 --> 01:26:46.748
...but I will speak with her, madame.

01:26:47.291 --> 01:26:48.625
But--

01:26:50.085 --> 01:26:52.796
How can we be expected
to live in a place...

01:26:53.005 --> 01:26:56.049
...without any certainty
of our position?

01:26:56.341 --> 01:26:57.718
I don't understand.

01:26:57.801 --> 01:27:01.221
The Duchesse de Char
was very angry.

01:27:01.346 --> 01:27:03.849
But this is my escape
from all the protocol.

01:27:03.974 --> 01:27:07.311
Raumont, amongst others,
was complaining.

01:27:08.312 --> 01:27:13.233
Well, we'll invite them to the theater
for my first performance.

01:27:13.233 --> 01:27:16.570
- We'll need an audience.
- Splendid.

01:27:59.613 --> 01:28:01.532
Bravo!

01:28:02.950 --> 01:28:04.326
Bravo!

01:28:05.035 --> 01:28:06.620
Bravo!

01:28:08.497 --> 01:28:11.542
And in the end, I don't know
how they go out.

01:28:11.625 --> 01:28:14.628
- It's always raining there.
- Not like here. It's always raining.

01:28:14.753 --> 01:28:16.630
They are cheerful, I must admit.

01:28:17.965 --> 01:28:19.341
There's someone to see you.

01:28:19.550 --> 01:28:21.426
Oh, who?

01:28:27.474 --> 01:28:28.934
Good afternoon!

01:28:29.059 --> 01:28:32.479
You've come to pay me a visit.
How gallant you are.

01:28:32.563 --> 01:28:36.149
- Have you seen Marie Thérèse today?
- She's been married off.

01:28:36.233 --> 01:28:38.735
Can't we at least wait
until she's talking?

01:28:38.819 --> 01:28:40.070
If you insist.

01:28:40.195 --> 01:28:44.157
Come home. We're having a ball for
the soldiers who fought in America.

01:28:44.241 --> 01:28:45.826
I will.

01:28:49.496 --> 01:28:51.665
I hope there are
some handsome generals.

01:28:51.748 --> 01:28:54.585
They've been away from women
a long time, you know.

01:28:55.335 --> 01:28:58.005
May I also present Comte d'Estaing.

01:28:59.256 --> 01:29:03.844
Excellent victory on the capture
of Grenada. Excellent.

01:29:05.345 --> 01:29:07.097
Congratulations.

01:29:08.265 --> 01:29:12.519
Your Majesty, may I present
Colonel Smythe.

01:29:14.396 --> 01:29:17.191
May I also present Count Fersen.

01:29:19.610 --> 01:29:21.195
Count Fersen.

01:29:21.278 --> 01:29:23.864
Pleasure's all mine.

01:29:26.074 --> 01:29:27.951
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

01:29:28.285 --> 01:29:30.537
- What is this?
- It's a wild strawberry.

01:29:30.662 --> 01:29:32.206
Try it. It's quite exquisite.

01:29:34.291 --> 01:29:37.961
Honestly! "The Marriage of Figaro".
You'd love it.

01:29:38.045 --> 01:29:40.255
The servants take over the house.

01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:42.132
It's superb.

01:29:42.216 --> 01:29:44.968
The women were carrying
the verses around on their fans.

01:29:45.052 --> 01:29:47.638
Best thing I've seen for years.
You enjoyed it, didn't you?

01:29:47.888 --> 01:29:49.014
I think we saw it together.

01:29:49.139 --> 01:29:51.391
It was over three hours.
Far too long for me.

01:29:51.517 --> 01:29:53.894
- Cheers, everybody.
- To the queen.

01:29:54.019 --> 01:29:55.687
To our queen.

01:29:57.147 --> 01:29:59.233
Have a good evening.

01:29:59.316 --> 01:30:01.527
And to Raumont
for bringing the oysters.

01:30:01.652 --> 01:30:03.904
To Raumont for the oysters.

01:30:04.029 --> 01:30:06.114
And to Lamballe
for bringing the flowers.

01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:08.325
For the flowers, beautiful flowers.

01:30:08.408 --> 01:30:11.411
And to Fersen for coming
all the way from Sweden.

01:30:11.537 --> 01:30:12.788
- Yes.
- To Sweden.

01:30:12.913 --> 01:30:14.456
All the way from Sweden.

01:30:14.998 --> 01:30:18.001
That is a very long journey,
I must say.

01:30:18.085 --> 01:30:20.921
- How long was it?
- Took about ten days.

01:30:21.004 --> 01:30:23.090
Yes, ten days
is a very long time.

01:30:23.215 --> 01:30:26.134
Personally, I can't travel
that much myself.

01:30:27.094 --> 01:30:30.305
- Far too long.
- I must show you this trick.

01:30:30.305 --> 01:30:35.519
Everybody, lick your finger and then
rub it around the rim of the glass.

01:30:35.602 --> 01:30:37.604
Beautiful.

01:30:37.688 --> 01:30:40.440
- A horrible sound.
- Oh, come on. It's like angels.

01:30:41.149 --> 01:30:44.069
- It's like angels.
- It's very pretty.

01:30:44.069 --> 01:30:45.737
It is pretty, isn't it?

01:30:47.823 --> 01:30:50.617
It's very spiritual, really, isn't it?

01:30:52.202 --> 01:30:54.788
When was the last time
you went to Mass?

01:30:56.999 --> 01:30:59.501
- Of sorts.
- I haven't seen it.

01:30:59.626 --> 01:31:00.878
Ask another question.

01:31:01.044 --> 01:31:02.713
- I can ask another question?
- Yeah.

01:31:03.547 --> 01:31:05.132
Am I a male?

01:31:05.215 --> 01:31:06.592
- No.
- No.

01:31:07.426 --> 01:31:09.094
Partially.

01:31:10.053 --> 01:31:11.388
That's terrible.

01:31:11.471 --> 01:31:12.848
Oh, that's so mean.

01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:14.933
My turn, it's my turn.

01:31:15.142 --> 01:31:16.476
Am I a woman?

01:31:16.602 --> 01:31:18.812
Am I a soldier?

01:31:18.896 --> 01:31:21.815
- Do I write music?
- Yes.

01:31:21.899 --> 01:31:23.150
Am I a vegetable?

01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:25.652
- Yes. Good question.
- Yes.

01:31:26.403 --> 01:31:28.405
Am I...

01:31:29.948 --> 01:31:31.200
...from the ancient world?

01:31:31.325 --> 01:31:33.994
- Am I here?
- No.

01:31:34.119 --> 01:31:35.495
No, thank God.

01:31:35.579 --> 01:31:37.581
Am I...

01:31:37.664 --> 01:31:38.999
...present now?

01:31:39.249 --> 01:31:41.001
- Yes.
- Yes, always.

01:31:41.627 --> 01:31:44.004
- Am I--?
- You're very talented.

01:31:44.129 --> 01:31:46.340
- Am I Alexander the Great?
- Yes.

01:31:46.423 --> 01:31:48.091
Is it Mozart?

01:31:48.717 --> 01:31:51.512
- You saw!
- You've seen yours.

01:31:51.637 --> 01:31:53.430
That's the second time
I've won as well.

01:31:53.514 --> 01:31:56.099
- You saw that.
- There's something in the oysters.

01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:08.195
Be careful, please.

01:32:39.309 --> 01:32:42.229
But you should try to visit America.

01:32:42.813 --> 01:32:45.858
It's beautiful, very different
than France.

01:32:46.066 --> 01:32:48.652
Our queen seems rather fond
of looking at Count Fersen.

01:32:48.777 --> 01:32:51.697
Then you've not heard
of the Hasselhoff family singers?

01:32:51.905 --> 01:32:53.156
No.

01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:55.325
Well, he's easy on the eyes.

01:32:56.827 --> 01:32:59.204
But don't you think she favors him
too clearly?

01:33:00.038 --> 01:33:01.707
Just because it is not you?

01:33:01.832 --> 01:33:04.334
Don't you think it would be
unbecoming to our queen...

01:33:04.418 --> 01:33:06.920
...when he has quite a reputation?

01:33:07.004 --> 01:33:09.214
He amuses her,
and she likes to be amused.

01:33:10.340 --> 01:33:13.594
There's nothing unregal
in that, monsieur.

01:33:17.681 --> 01:33:20.267
- You must meet soldiers all the time.
- No, I don't.

01:33:20.350 --> 01:33:21.602
You don't?

01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:37.845
And then he took it out.
Just like that.

01:34:37.928 --> 01:34:40.681
I said, "What do you think
you'll do with that, monsieur?"

01:34:40.764 --> 01:34:43.183
Oh, good God, don't act all innocent.

01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:45.018
Please.

01:34:45.269 --> 01:34:47.855
I could have told him exactly
what to do with it.

01:34:47.855 --> 01:34:49.606
And what is that, darling?

01:34:49.857 --> 01:34:52.025
Put it back in his trousers
where it belonged.

01:34:52.109 --> 01:34:55.696
Lamballe, ladies and gentlemen,
is what we call a prude.

01:34:55.696 --> 01:34:57.114
Better than a whore.

01:34:59.324 --> 01:35:01.618
I wish I could go with you.

01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:04.621
I should kidnap you.

01:36:32.334 --> 01:36:36.088
Of course, you know
the one about the English letter.

01:36:38.715 --> 01:36:41.385
Don't you want to go to Paris,
see the opera?

01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:42.886
Your go.

01:36:42.970 --> 01:36:45.681
I'm more comfortable
just to stay here.

01:36:46.223 --> 01:36:47.641
We have everything we need.

01:36:47.766 --> 01:36:51.103
I should talk to the priest.
No, that's inexcusable.

01:36:51.228 --> 01:36:54.147
It is. It's dangerous for her safety.

01:36:54.231 --> 01:36:56.233
Goodness, a criminal
could come in here.

01:36:56.316 --> 01:36:58.485
- Cheat.
- Conceivably her husband.

01:36:59.236 --> 01:37:02.906
You know, I heard
she's not even really a duchess.

01:37:02.906 --> 01:37:04.241
Yeah, it's all a front.

01:37:04.324 --> 01:37:07.244
Her husband's a thief,
and he bought her title.

01:37:07.369 --> 01:37:09.580
Is that what happened? Really?

01:37:09.663 --> 01:37:11.248
That's what I heard.

01:37:13.333 --> 01:37:16.753
- How much did that cost?
- A fortune.

01:37:16.753 --> 01:37:18.755
It would cost a fortune, wouldn't it?

01:37:18.922 --> 01:37:21.967
To buy a title? Yes. At the court?

01:37:25.512 --> 01:37:26.763
She shouldn't be allowed.

01:37:26.847 --> 01:37:29.183
She should buy a new dress,
is what she should buy.

01:37:29.266 --> 01:37:31.768
She should buy a new dress,
yeah, you're right.

01:37:57.961 --> 01:37:59.796
Vaguely.

01:38:00.964 --> 01:38:03.467
- What are you laughing at?
- Nothing.

01:38:04.218 --> 01:38:06.053
May I be excused?

01:38:06.595 --> 01:38:08.388
Yes, of course, madame.

01:38:08.972 --> 01:38:11.892
I might go and ask her.
That way she'll tell us exactly.

01:38:12.017 --> 01:38:13.977
Ask her about her family.

01:39:01.358 --> 01:39:03.944
The problem of the debt
is grave, Your Majesty.

01:39:04.027 --> 01:39:05.696
The people of France are hungry.

01:39:05.946 --> 01:39:10.117
Sending troops to America is costing
more than what we estimated.

01:39:10.117 --> 01:39:12.619
But we can't let England win.

01:39:13.203 --> 01:39:15.956
We must show our strength.

01:39:19.168 --> 01:39:22.087
We will continue aid
to the Americans.

01:39:23.881 --> 01:39:28.969
<i>And when they went to the queen</i>
<i>to tell her her subjects had no bread...</i>

01:39:28.969 --> 01:39:31.555
<i>...do you know what she said?</i>

01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:34.183
Let them eat cake.

01:39:34.308 --> 01:39:37.311
That's such nonsense.
I would never say that.

01:39:37.728 --> 01:39:41.899
And here you're having
an orgy with quite a big group.

01:39:41.899 --> 01:39:43.483
I think I'm here sucking your toes.

01:39:43.567 --> 01:39:45.861
Don't they ever tire
of these ridiculous stories?

01:39:45.986 --> 01:39:51.074
They say you gave Thomas Jefferson
a special tour of your gardens.

01:39:52.242 --> 01:39:55.329
Is Jefferson admiring
the royal bush?

01:39:57.122 --> 01:39:59.833
- Oh, that's awful.
- Can't you do something?

01:40:00.584 --> 01:40:02.961
I'm not going to acknowledge it.

01:40:04.630 --> 01:40:06.507
The French can be fickle...

01:40:06.715 --> 01:40:11.011
...and Her Majesty would do well
to be more attentive.

01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:14.765
Life is getting harder
for the people of France.

01:40:14.765 --> 01:40:17.017
The bread shortage is grave.

01:40:17.142 --> 01:40:20.687
Well, there must be something the
king can do to ease their sufferings.

01:40:21.313 --> 01:40:24.525
Tell the court jeweler
to stop sending diamonds.

01:40:24.775 --> 01:40:27.444
You don't need any diamonds,
do you?

01:40:27.569 --> 01:40:30.489
- No.
- How pretty Madame Royale is.

01:40:30.614 --> 01:40:32.699
I'm pleased you find me so.

01:40:34.034 --> 01:40:35.911
Say thank you.

01:40:37.287 --> 01:40:39.873
She is certainly
a daughter of France.

01:40:39.957 --> 01:40:41.542
Oh, I know.

01:40:44.044 --> 01:40:45.504
What's the matter?

01:40:46.046 --> 01:40:47.881
Your mother has died.

01:40:48.006 --> 01:40:49.883
I'm so sorry.

01:41:04.565 --> 01:41:09.570
<i>Oh, my brother, I am devastated</i>
<i>by the news of our mother's death.</i>

01:41:10.112 --> 01:41:13.240
<i>You alone are left to me in Austria...</i>

01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:17.077
<i>...which is and will always be</i>
<i>so dear to me.</i>

01:41:17.202 --> 01:41:21.498
<i>Remember we are your friends,</i>
<i>your allies.</i>

01:41:21.582 --> 01:41:23.250
<i>I embrace you.</i>

01:41:38.056 --> 01:41:43.270
Madame, you have fulfilled
our wishes and those of France.

01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:44.855
You are the mother of a dauphin.

01:41:49.193 --> 01:41:53.280
May I present the dauphin of France.

01:42:08.795 --> 01:42:11.715
What a joy. The dauphin of France.

01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:39.733
Hello. Why don't you hit
the ball over there?

01:46:40.025 --> 01:46:42.236
Come on. You're gonna hit it.

01:46:49.201 --> 01:46:54.748
Your Majesty, the Bastille fortress
was stormed by an angry mob.

01:47:00.254 --> 01:47:03.257
In view of the hatred felt
for the Duchesse de Polignac...

01:47:03.382 --> 01:47:05.175
...thought to be
the queen's favorite...

01:47:05.467 --> 01:47:09.012
...I would recommend that
she leave for the Swiss border.

01:47:09.096 --> 01:47:13.600
I also must urge all of the princes
and princesses of the blood...

01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:15.060
...to leave at once.

01:47:15.269 --> 01:47:18.397
Yes, they must go. I will stay.

01:47:18.397 --> 01:47:21.942
Certainly the royal family
must find somewhere more secure.

01:47:22.025 --> 01:47:24.653
Metz is one of the strongest
fortresses in Europe.

01:47:24.862 --> 01:47:26.321
You will not be safe here.

01:47:26.446 --> 01:47:29.783
I will see to it that
my mistresses are off at once...

01:47:29.867 --> 01:47:32.578
...but my place is here
with my husband.

01:48:02.733 --> 01:48:04.276
Goodbye.

01:49:33.824 --> 01:49:36.994
Your Majesty, your immediate
return is requested.

01:49:37.077 --> 01:49:38.412
There's a mob of hundreds...

01:49:38.662 --> 01:49:41.874
...on their way in demand
of flour from their sovereign.

01:49:46.670 --> 01:49:48.964
It would be more secure
to decamp to Rambouillet...

01:49:49.089 --> 01:49:52.092
- ...twice the distance from Paris.
- I will not be a fugitive king.

01:49:52.092 --> 01:49:53.427
It is too dangerous here.

01:49:53.677 --> 01:49:55.345
At least send
the queen and children.

01:49:55.429 --> 01:49:58.015
My place is at the king's side.

01:49:58.432 --> 01:50:00.642
The first of them
have arrived in town.

01:50:00.767 --> 01:50:02.519
We will stay here.

01:50:25.459 --> 01:50:28.712
Save the queen, madame.
They're coming to kill her.

01:50:38.055 --> 01:50:40.807
Celine, don't be frightened.

01:50:40.807 --> 01:50:42.142
Let's get the children.

01:54:57.731 --> 01:55:00.400
Are you admiring your lime avenue?

01:55:03.987 --> 01:55:05.656
I'm saying goodbye.
