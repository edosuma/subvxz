They're no good in the TVA, Mr. Laufeyson.

17:31.750 --> 17:34.875
The court finds you guilty,
and I sentence you to be reset.

17:34.958 --> 17:36.458

"Reset"? What does that mean?
What, is it bad? What does it mean?

Hey! You ridiculous bureaucrats
will not dictate how my story ends!

17:45.167 --> 17:48.542
It's not your story, Mr. Laufeyson.
It never was.

it's a bad idea.

Okay. I feel like
I'm always looking up to you.

19:02.792 --> 19:03.833
There isn't.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.042
That's not real.

19:28.125 --> 19:31.250

so is all the paperwork.

Good tinder for your fire, though.
Come on.

19:34.375 --> 19:35.708
This place is a nightmare.

19:35.792 --> 19:37.042
That's another department.

Come on.

22:16.875 --> 22:18.375
You don't know anything about me.

Midgard.

23:07.500 --> 23:09.250
AKA Earth.

23:10.458 --> 23:13.167
All right. Now you're the king of Midgard,
then what?

Honestly, I'm actually a fan. Yeah.

with so much range just wanna rule?
