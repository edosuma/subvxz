ENRIQUE:
This is it.

00:06.156 --> 00:07.822
This is where he used to hide

00:07.916 --> 00:10.400
weapons, jewelry, silver coins.

00:10.494 --> 00:11.677
GYPSY:
There's something there.

00:11.904 --> 00:12.827
Right there.

00:12.847 --> 00:14.421
MATTY:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.089
That is a coin.

00:16.183 --> 00:18.575
CINDY: Villa used
the tunnels to escape.

00:20.003 --> 00:21.261
- There's got to be more of these around, Matty.
- (chuckles)

00:21.413 --> 00:22.095
- Yeah, that's right.
- ENRIQUE: Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.171
We'd love to help you find some.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.106
MATTY:
Uh-huh.

00:25.842 --> 00:26.692
JACKSON:
Oh, what is that?

00:26.843 --> 00:28.176
What you got?

00:28.195 --> 00:29.436
MATTY:
Oh, wow.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.779
MARTY:
Oh, baby.

00:33.016 --> 00:34.608
All the while
we were growing up,

00:34.702 --> 00:37.703
my brother and I were fascinated
with finding treasure.

00:39.040 --> 00:39.872
RICK:
Pirate treasure,

00:40.023 --> 00:41.598
cursed treasure.

00:41.617 --> 00:43.542
Civil War gold.

00:43.693 --> 00:46.453
- (laughter) - Since then,
our work on Oak Island

00:46.605 --> 00:48.696
has shown us
there's a world of mysteries...

00:48.716 --> 00:51.775
- Whoa.
- waiting to be explored.

00:51.794 --> 00:54.611
RICK: So, we like to reach
out to other treasure hunters.

00:54.630 --> 00:56.797
X marks the spot, right there.
Brilliant.

00:56.891 --> 00:59.058
- MARTY: We want to hear their stories...
- That's right.

00:59.285 --> 01:01.635
- and share our insights.
- "Ill-gotten gains."

01:01.787 --> 01:03.136
- RICK: And who knows...
- GARY: I got it.

01:03.289 --> 01:04.879
maybe we can help them
with their search.

01:04.899 --> 01:06.473
MARTY:
Not only in America.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.292
Wow. That is gold.

01:08.310 --> 01:10.143
- RICK: But all over the world.
- Yeah.

01:26.736 --> 01:27.994
All right.

01:28.089 --> 01:30.881
Does it have
something to do with treasure?

01:32.151 --> 01:33.092
It indeed does, my friends.

01:33.319 --> 01:34.409
Uh...

01:34.503 --> 01:36.169
I think this one

you have

a bunch of things
you hope for, right?

01:45.514 --> 01:48.498
And one of them would be
colorful personalities involved.

01:48.517 --> 01:50.609
And there's probably
no more exciting history

01:50.760 --> 01:53.854
than when you talk about
revolutionaries, right?

01:53.948 --> 01:56.931
Major upheaval, wars,

01:57.025 --> 01:58.358
people rising up.

01:58.510 --> 02:00.344
The common denominator
in all of these is

02:00.437 --> 02:02.529
- strife, upheaval, violence.
- Yeah.

02:02.681 --> 02:06.274
The shifting tides
of-of human fortunes.

02:06.368 --> 02:07.609
It take-takes more
than that, though.

02:07.703 --> 02:09.128
People only rally to people

02:09.279 --> 02:10.796
that are very charismatic.

02:10.947 --> 02:13.298
Someone they can tie into,
someone they can believe in.

02:13.525 --> 02:16.193
Well, I mean, we talk about
a time line a lot on Oak Island,

02:16.286 --> 02:18.545
and if you look at
a time line of revolutions,

02:18.697 --> 02:20.788
a lot of them, especially when
we're trying to connect it

02:20.883 --> 02:23.033
to Oak Island, for example,
are-are far in the past.

02:23.126 --> 02:25.535
American Revolution,
French Revolution.

02:25.554 --> 02:27.479
Um, but when you talk
about the Mexican Revolution,

02:27.631 --> 02:28.963
that wasn't that long ago.

02:28.983 --> 02:30.298
- Turn of the century, right?
- 20th century.

02:30.392 --> 02:31.233
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

02:32.636 --> 02:35.303
NARRATOR:
In 1910, Mexico was heading

02:35.322 --> 02:37.656
for a highly-contested
presidential election...

02:39.160 --> 02:42.661
just as the nation
was on the brink of revolution.

02:44.165 --> 02:46.331
GROSSMAN: Porfirio Díaz had been
the President of Mexico

02:46.558 --> 02:48.241
for 31 years

02:48.335 --> 02:51.319
and was seen by a large portion
of the Mexican population

02:51.413 --> 02:52.754
as corrupt and oppressive.

02:54.175 --> 02:56.157
SARGENT: A lot of folks were
rising up and opposing

02:56.177 --> 02:57.734
that kind of leadership.

02:57.753 --> 03:01.996
It was a situation where
the people needed a change,

03:02.016 --> 03:06.092
and the change that they needed
required a revolution.

03:06.245 --> 03:08.187
The history is complex, uh,

03:08.414 --> 03:11.005
with various revolutionaries
jockeying for power.

03:11.025 --> 03:14.026
Some more conservative,
some more liberal.

03:14.177 --> 03:17.196
Francisco Madero really leads
the first phase

03:17.347 --> 03:18.922
of the Mexican Revolution.

03:18.941 --> 03:21.867
And of course,
on the military side,

03:22.094 --> 03:26.187
Pascual Orozco and Pancho Villa
developed armies

03:26.281 --> 03:30.191
and were fighting all across
the northern part of Mexico

03:30.211 --> 03:31.627
in support of Madero.

03:33.380 --> 03:36.531
I think if someone had mentioned
the Mexican Revolution,

03:36.625 --> 03:38.866
I think Pancho Villa's name
would be

03:38.886 --> 03:41.202
- the first thing in your mind, right?
- Yeah, absolutely.

03:41.222 --> 03:43.797
The name is
instantly recognizable, right?

03:43.891 --> 03:48.209
NARRATOR: General Francisco
"Pancho" Villa was the commander

03:48.229 --> 03:51.788
od the<i> División del Norte--</i>
Or Division of the North--

03:51.881 --> 03:54.124
In the Mexican state
of Chihuahua.

03:54.217 --> 03:57.644
Although he had
a very humble upbringing,

03:57.796 --> 04:01.147
Villa would not only become
one of the most notable leaders

04:01.300 --> 04:04.484
in the Mexican Revolution
and the governor of Chihuahua,

04:04.636 --> 04:08.396
but, according to researchers,
would also amass a fortune

04:08.490 --> 04:10.156
in plundered valuables.

04:10.251 --> 04:14.828
One of the main sources
where Pancho Villa got

04:14.980 --> 04:17.147
most of his money
for his revolutionary army

04:17.165 --> 04:19.508
was confiscation.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.911
General Villa primarily
made money by confiscating

04:23.931 --> 04:26.431
the properties of the wealthy.

04:26.583 --> 04:29.751
There was one occasion
where Pancho Villa took

04:29.770 --> 04:33.847
about 600,000 pesos in gold bars

04:33.999 --> 04:36.591
from the former governor
of Chihuahua

04:36.610 --> 04:39.002
by the name of Luis Terrazas.

04:39.021 --> 04:41.688
So it was quite a bit.
It was a-a substantial amount.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.840
You have a lot of money,

04:43.859 --> 04:45.767
it's wise to hide it
in different places.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.193
So, in case you're discovered,

04:47.346 --> 04:50.104
they're not going to acquire
everything.

04:50.124 --> 04:55.018
So you have to strategically
distribute your assets

04:55.111 --> 04:57.203
in multiple locations
for safety.

04:57.298 --> 04:59.614
It was all about hiding.

04:59.708 --> 05:03.618
Villa was operating in El Paso,

05:03.712 --> 05:05.470
financially and in terms of

05:05.622 --> 05:07.306
acquiring weapons
and ammunition.

05:07.533 --> 05:08.623
He was involved in
counterfeiting operations,

05:08.642 --> 05:10.367
smuggling operations,

05:10.460 --> 05:12.886
but he managed to put together

05:13.038 --> 05:16.106
quite a lump of cash
and bullion.

05:17.893 --> 05:20.710
NARRATOR:
On July 20, 1923,

05:20.804 --> 05:23.380
Pancho Villa was ambushed
and assassinated

05:23.473 --> 05:26.158
in Parral, Mexico,
by political rivals.

05:26.385 --> 05:29.736
He would leave behind
an incredible legacy

05:29.888 --> 05:34.148
and, according to
many researchers,

05:34.242 --> 05:36.168
a number of buried treasures

05:36.395 --> 05:40.488
between El Paso, Texas
and Chihuahua, Mexico.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.841
One of these verified locations,

05:42.992 --> 05:45.493
known today
as the Villa Stash House,

05:45.587 --> 05:49.514
was raided by U.S. officials
in 1915,

05:49.741 --> 05:52.017
where thousands of dollars
in looted treasure

05:52.168 --> 05:54.744
was recovered
from a hidden safe.

05:54.763 --> 05:56.504
When the Customs and Treasury
went in there

05:56.598 --> 05:58.582
and they got the safe open,

05:58.675 --> 06:01.008
uh, it was packed full,
it was solid.

06:01.103 --> 06:05.012
So that leads people to believe
that they had more stash

06:05.032 --> 06:08.425
somewhere around that building,
that property.

06:08.443 --> 06:09.943
They could've buried it
in the backyard.

06:10.095 --> 06:12.095
They could've stashed it
in tunnels.

06:12.114 --> 06:17.191
We know of some tunnels
that were built in El Paso.

06:17.285 --> 06:20.194
- So where's the treasure?
- MATTY: Well,

06:20.288 --> 06:21.955
my contact's in El Paso, Texas,

06:22.049 --> 06:25.533
and he is, uh, very connected
to its history.

06:25.627 --> 06:27.052
His name is Jackson Polk.

06:27.203 --> 06:30.296
He hosts a radio show
and he's a local historian.

06:30.391 --> 06:33.283
- Mm-hmm.
- He seems to have a line on somewhere.

06:33.376 --> 06:35.619
I-I saw the phrase
"stash house."

06:35.712 --> 06:38.471
Ah, that sounds good,
for openers.

06:38.624 --> 06:41.141
When I saw "Mexican Revolution,
Pancho Villa, stash house,"

06:41.235 --> 06:43.627
I was like, "I think I need
to tell you guys about this."

06:43.645 --> 06:44.978
So I think we should
talk to Jackson.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.071
D-Do you have him standing by?

06:46.298 --> 06:48.073
I do. Yeah?

06:48.300 --> 06:49.408
- Yeah.
- You're pretty good at this Matty.

06:49.635 --> 06:50.634
- I'm getting better.
- Let's talk to this guy.

06:50.652 --> 06:53.303
All right. I think, uh,

06:53.396 --> 06:55.580
Jackson Polk
should be standing by.

06:55.732 --> 06:57.398
Hey, Jackson,
welcome to the war room.

06:57.492 --> 07:00.160
It's Matty, and I'm here
with Rick and Marty Lagina.

07:00.312 --> 07:02.996
- MARTY: Hello, Jackson.
- Good to see you gentlemen, how's it going?

07:03.090 --> 07:04.589
You're about to make our day.

07:04.816 --> 07:05.924
<i>Well, I hope so.
We'll see what happens here.</i>

07:06.151 --> 07:08.818
We got some, uh,
hidden treasures around El Paso.

07:08.837 --> 07:10.578
Why this story?

07:10.672 --> 07:12.672
<i>I love El Paso and its history.</i>

07:12.766 --> 07:15.008
I sort of knew about
the Stash House, but not until

07:15.160 --> 07:17.269
<i>we had a story
all about Pancho Villa</i>

07:17.420 --> 07:19.771
on the radio a couple times
and explained it.

07:19.998 --> 07:23.500
NARRATOR: Born and
raised in El Paso, Texas,

07:23.593 --> 07:26.111
Jackson Polk's fascination
with history

07:26.338 --> 07:28.930
led him to a career
as a documentary filmmaker,

07:29.024 --> 07:32.451
broadcast journalist
and radio host.

07:32.602 --> 07:35.436
JACKSON: I started studying
and I joined the historical society.

07:35.530 --> 07:37.122
As I heard more and more,

07:37.273 --> 07:40.016
I realized
that the Mexican Revolution

07:40.035 --> 07:42.109
was planned in El Paso.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.277
I started figuring out
Pancho Villa

07:43.297 --> 07:45.112
was a man to be reckoned with.

07:45.207 --> 07:49.526
Pancho Villa turned into a guy
who had to manage his fortune,

07:49.619 --> 07:51.528
so he started
stashing it places.

07:51.546 --> 07:53.863
He stashed it
several places in Mexico.

07:53.957 --> 07:56.141
We know he stashed it
in El Paso.

07:56.368 --> 07:58.718
He had a house here
called the Stash House.

07:58.812 --> 08:02.797
And at one point, the U.S.
Customs raided it, in 1915.

08:02.891 --> 08:05.058
MATTY:
So, this stash house,

08:05.152 --> 08:07.134
it was already raided before.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.320
Um, are there any indications

08:08.547 --> 08:10.897
that there is still
treasure there?

08:11.049 --> 08:12.565
<i>JACKSON:
Well, there may be.</i>

08:12.659 --> 08:16.069
Cindy Medina has become the
publicist for the Stash House.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.330
<i>And she introduced me to a guy
named Enrique Guajardo.</i>

08:18.481 --> 08:22.149
<i>He owns the property,
and he's, uh, fixing it up.</i>

08:22.244 --> 08:24.227
<i>And he's pulled up a wood floor</i>

08:24.320 --> 08:26.396
<i>and found two empty areas
in the floor</i>

08:26.414 --> 08:27.839
<i>where there could have
been weapons,</i>

08:27.991 --> 08:29.490
<i>could have been gold,
could have been a lot of things.</i>

08:29.510 --> 08:31.568
<i>But there were definitely
stash locations</i>

08:31.586 --> 08:33.512
<i>under the wooden floor.</i>

08:33.663 --> 08:35.329
<i>He's already found some
artifacts on the property.</i>

08:35.349 --> 08:37.590
Lot of old bottles,
lot of old paperwork.

08:37.743 --> 08:38.758
So, stuff that puts

08:38.910 --> 08:41.335
<i>the location there active</i>

08:41.355 --> 08:44.356
in, uh, the 1910-1915
time frame.

08:44.583 --> 08:46.841
<i>He's agreeable to having
you guys come take a look at it.</i>

08:46.935 --> 08:48.418
<i>He never used metal detecting,</i>

08:48.511 --> 08:49.936
and if you bring
your electronics,

08:50.030 --> 08:51.755
I think you have a good chance
at finding something.

08:51.848 --> 08:53.365
MARTY:
Uh, I think that'd be great.

08:53.592 --> 08:55.275
We think we can bring
a-a very professional,

08:55.427 --> 08:58.945
very skilled metal detector
person as well as the equipment,

08:59.039 --> 09:01.281
and maybe help out with the, uh,
ground-penetrating radar, too.

09:01.375 --> 09:02.932
RICK:
Absolutely.

09:02.951 --> 09:04.617
<i>JACKSON:
That's exactly what we need,</i>

09:04.711 --> 09:06.711
<i>because I think what's hidden
is well hidden.</i>

09:06.863 --> 09:08.772
(chuckles)
Okay, good.

09:08.865 --> 09:10.698
- MATTY: All right, thank you, Jackson, great stuff.
- We're in.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.700
And, uh, we will figure out
w-who's going

09:12.719 --> 09:14.127
and-and we'll coordinate
with you.

09:14.279 --> 09:15.612
<i>- Thank you.</i>
- MARTY: All right.

09:15.705 --> 09:18.557
Thank you, sir.
Pleasure meeting you.

09:18.784 --> 09:21.208
It's fascinating.
Absolutely fascinating.

09:21.228 --> 09:24.045
Who's coming?
Can both of you come this time?

09:24.064 --> 09:26.064
You know, count me in
on this one, Matty.

09:26.291 --> 09:28.215
Count me in. I've got some
business interests, actually,

09:28.235 --> 09:30.143
in New Mexico, so I might be
able to dovetail that.

09:30.295 --> 09:32.553
- MATTY: Oh.
- So let's go to El Paso.

09:32.573 --> 09:34.464
<i>- Sí.</i>
- (laughter)

09:34.482 --> 09:35.799
<i>- Sí.</i>
- Big brother?

09:35.892 --> 09:37.391
- What about you, Rick?
- RICK: Uh...

09:37.411 --> 09:41.079
I would love to go,
but I... you know, you know...

09:41.230 --> 09:42.897
- One of us should probably be here, so...
- One of us should stay.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.749
I have no problem
with both of you going.

09:44.901 --> 09:46.251
And I look forward
to the reports.

09:46.478 --> 09:47.811
Let's do it.

09:47.829 --> 09:49.479
<i>Amigo, vámanos.</i>

09:49.572 --> 09:51.506
- (laughter)
- MATTY:<i> Vámanos.</i>

09:55.762 --> 09:57.411
The interesting

09:57.431 --> 09:58.763
- Thank-thanks for coming.
- (chuckles): Uh, yeah, hey.

09:58.990 --> 10:00.765
-We're all excited about it. Eh, Matty?
-Yeah.

10:00.992 --> 10:02.175
Well, we need some help here
looking for things,

10:02.327 --> 10:03.843
and you guys
are pretty good at that.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.271
So I got to thinking, well,
if you can make it to El Paso,

10:06.422 --> 10:08.923
we have some very interesting
things you can go look for.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.276
Hey, we're headed for a place
called the Stash House.

10:11.503 --> 10:14.170
- MATTY: I love it. I love it.
- That's got to be a good place to look, right?

10:14.189 --> 10:16.673
NARRATOR: Three days after
their meeting in the war room,

10:16.691 --> 10:20.601
Marty Lagina and Matty Blake
travel to El Paso, Texas

10:20.695 --> 10:24.438
to meet with treasure hunter
and historian Jackson Polk.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.015
JACKSON: It's a great
city, it's got so much history,

10:26.034 --> 10:28.126
it's kind of hard to begin
where to tell it.

10:28.277 --> 10:31.187
NARRATOR: Together, they'll be
conducting a comprehensive search

10:31.280 --> 10:33.189
of a property that once belonged

10:33.208 --> 10:36.801
to the notorious Mexican
revolutionary Pancho Villa,

10:36.953 --> 10:39.195
who is known to have hidden
stolen valuables here

10:39.214 --> 10:41.714
in the early 20th century.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.309
MATTY: So, the stash house
we're going to right now,

10:44.536 --> 10:48.796
in 1915, you know,
$500,000 was found

10:48.815 --> 10:51.040
by U.S. government officials.

10:51.134 --> 10:53.393
- And $30,000 in jewelry.
- (scoffs)

10:53.545 --> 10:55.153
And w-what's interesting
about it is,

10:55.380 --> 10:57.155
they did find some things
in the floors,

10:57.306 --> 10:59.306
they found the stuff
in the safe.

10:59.326 --> 11:03.386
But frankly, knowing how I think
Villa would-would operate,

11:03.405 --> 11:07.165
it looks to me like there could
easily be more things in there.

11:07.392 --> 11:08.908
Yeah, the safe
is too obvious, isn't it?

11:09.002 --> 11:11.744
Yeah, and you know,
if he's got a stash house,

11:11.897 --> 11:13.672
you think he's gonna
put it all in one safe

11:13.823 --> 11:15.840
where everyone knows it is?
It doesn't make sense, right?

11:15.992 --> 11:18.009
No, it's almost like the dummy
treasure idea on Oak Island.

11:18.161 --> 11:19.994
- You know? Yeah.
- Yes. - Ah, yes.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.572
He would've put a lot of things
in the backyard, I think.

11:22.590 --> 11:24.424
Villa maybe used tunnels
as well.

11:24.576 --> 11:26.409
They weren't tunnels
for passage,

11:26.428 --> 11:28.669
so much as they were tunnels
for hiding things.

11:28.689 --> 11:30.337
- Okay.
- And there's a very good chance

11:30.432 --> 11:31.915
he did that at the Stash House.

11:31.933 --> 11:34.859
And that it would not be,
uh, easily detectable,

11:35.011 --> 11:37.178
because they had no technology
back in the day.

11:37.197 --> 11:40.681
Yous guys are used to doing
things with technology.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.534
That's what's gonna be
so interesting here.

11:42.761 --> 11:44.369
Here we are.

11:53.772 --> 11:54.713
JACKSON:
Welcome to the Stash House.

11:57.108 --> 11:58.550
MARTY: Clearly
we're at the right place.

11:58.777 --> 12:00.109
- All right.
- MATTY: This is great.

12:00.128 --> 12:01.869
- MARTY: Very cool.
- Hey!

12:01.888 --> 12:03.780
- How are you guys? Welcome.
- How are you?

12:03.798 --> 12:05.223
- This is Enrique? Matty Blake.
- Nice meeting you.

12:05.374 --> 12:07.967
NARRATOR: The former
hideout, or stash house,

12:08.119 --> 12:10.453
of Mexican revolutionary
Pancho Villa

12:10.546 --> 12:12.897
is now a historical landmark.

12:13.124 --> 12:14.715
Well, welcome
to the Stash House.

12:14.735 --> 12:16.234
NARRATOR: and was
purchased by Enrique Guajardo

12:16.461 --> 12:19.053
in 2015.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.314
To help in today's search
of the property,

12:21.408 --> 12:25.318
Enrique has also invited
the U.S. representative

12:25.470 --> 12:29.247
of the Pancho Villa Foundation,
Cindy Medina, to join the team.

12:29.398 --> 12:31.398
- MARTY: Very cool.
- It's incredible.

12:31.493 --> 12:34.143
NARRATOR: It was Cindy who
introduced Enrique to Jackson

12:34.162 --> 12:36.904
in the hopes that he could help
organize an effort

12:36.923 --> 12:40.074
to verify if any of
Villa's plundered fortune

12:40.093 --> 12:42.485
remains hidden
on the grounds today.

12:42.578 --> 12:44.988
It's a very unique piece
of property,

12:45.081 --> 12:46.747
and it carries a lot of history.

12:46.841 --> 12:50.769
My plans for the Stash House is
to convert it into a restaurant,

12:50.920 --> 12:53.587
bar, museum or galleria.

12:53.681 --> 12:57.016
But we stopped the renovation
because we started finding

12:57.110 --> 13:01.595
so many artifacts, so many items
that belonged to Pancho Villa.

13:01.615 --> 13:04.265
So, we wanted to have
a professional help

13:04.284 --> 13:05.508
here at the site.

13:05.527 --> 13:07.527
It's now or it's never.

13:07.679 --> 13:09.603
Let's have a look, if it's okay.

13:09.697 --> 13:11.790
- Let's go. Come on in.
- Marty, we are about to walk through

13:11.941 --> 13:13.107
- Pancho Villa's front door.
- We-we are stepping in

13:13.201 --> 13:15.126
- his footsteps.
- I love it.

13:15.278 --> 13:18.296
NARRATOR:
Between 1910 and 1920,

13:18.447 --> 13:21.207
during the height
of the Mexican Revolution...

13:21.301 --> 13:23.709
- Into Pancho Villa's lair.
- this adobe structure,

13:23.862 --> 13:27.864
which sits only 1,000 feet
from the U.S.-Mexico border...

13:27.882 --> 13:30.141
- This is awesome.
- was an ideal hiding place

13:30.293 --> 13:34.145
to stash weapons and treasure
that could help Pancho Villa

13:34.297 --> 13:37.206
wage war against
the government of Mexico.

13:37.300 --> 13:41.561
Built in 1899, both the house

13:41.713 --> 13:44.972
and the 4,200 square feet
of grounds surrounding it

13:44.991 --> 13:47.400
have never been searched
using modern scanning

13:47.552 --> 13:49.735
and metal detecting technology.

13:49.830 --> 13:52.813
However, when Enrique began
to remodel the property

13:52.907 --> 13:54.574
earlier this year,

13:54.726 --> 13:57.894
he quickly made
some surprising discoveries.

13:57.912 --> 13:59.504
This is it.

13:59.655 --> 14:04.491
This is where he used to hide
weapons, jewelry, cash.

14:04.586 --> 14:08.071
Oh, wow. I mean, this is the
first thing that my eye catches.

14:08.089 --> 14:09.906
You found this?

14:09.999 --> 14:11.832
ENRIQUE:
Yes, actually, um,

14:11.852 --> 14:15.745
when we start renovating
the house, we lift the floors.

14:15.763 --> 14:17.430
And when we were
lifting the floors,

14:17.582 --> 14:18.931
- we found some holes in there.
- Oh, my gosh.

14:19.084 --> 14:20.341
So, this was under the floor?

14:20.360 --> 14:21.934
ENRIQUE:
This was under the floor, yes.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.252
MATTY: This is the
original flooring here?

14:23.346 --> 14:24.420
ENRIQUE:
That's original flooring.

14:24.439 --> 14:26.364
Briefcase was here as well.

14:26.515 --> 14:27.514
MATTY: That was the
actual briefcase in there?

14:27.534 --> 14:29.016
ENRIQUE:
Yes, sir.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.517
I mean, that must have been
an incredible moment,

14:30.612 --> 14:31.870
opening that briefcase.

14:32.097 --> 14:33.538
- JACKSON: What was in it?
- Uh, it was empty.

14:33.765 --> 14:35.039
There was something there
at one time.

14:35.191 --> 14:36.541
Uh, there's just no doubt.

14:36.768 --> 14:38.618
There is just no doubt,
you just don't do that.

14:38.770 --> 14:40.103
Is it the Lone Ranger?
I don't think so.

14:40.121 --> 14:41.120
There's got to be more
of these around, then.

14:41.272 --> 14:42.121
- (laughter)
- Yeah, that's right.

14:42.273 --> 14:43.106
ENRIQUE:
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

14:43.199 --> 14:44.365
We'd love to help you find some.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.200
Do you guys believe
that we will find

14:46.219 --> 14:48.294
something of value here
on this property?

14:48.388 --> 14:50.630
-Most definitely. Most definitely.
-ENRIQUE: Yes.

14:50.782 --> 14:52.724
ENRIQUE:
Uh, people used to bury

14:52.951 --> 14:54.893
their treasures
on their backyards.

14:55.120 --> 14:58.137
And, uh, he had
some horse stables right

14:58.231 --> 14:59.880
- in the back in the patio.
- Oh, let's look at that.

14:59.900 --> 15:02.625
- Yeah, let me keep showing you.
- Yeah. - Yeah.

15:02.644 --> 15:04.961
ENRIQUE: Right here
used to be the horse stables.

15:04.979 --> 15:07.130
- MARTY: Mm-hmm.
- He used to keep all his horses.

15:07.148 --> 15:09.890
R-Remember, he used to travel
with his military.

15:09.984 --> 15:12.410
- Of course.
- So, there was more than 20 horses here.

15:12.637 --> 15:13.894
Has this ever
been metal-detected?

15:13.988 --> 15:15.747
- No, sir.
- Oh, really?

15:15.898 --> 15:17.749
- JACKSON: Oh, you're gonna love this.
- MATTY: That's good.

15:17.900 --> 15:20.493
You haven't even really done a-a
treasure hunt or proper search,

15:20.587 --> 15:22.403
but in your, just, work here,
you've found stuff.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.088
- Yes, I have.
- JACKSON That's why these guys are here.

15:24.240 --> 15:29.260
We found boxes,
boxes and boxes of stuff.

15:29.412 --> 15:31.320
-Let's have a look, please. Please.
-I'll show you.

15:31.339 --> 15:33.598
ENRIQUE:
This is the soldiers' house,

15:33.749 --> 15:35.099
- right here.
- Okay.

15:39.664 --> 15:42.832
So we got bullets and dynamite.

15:42.925 --> 15:45.017
- Whoa.
- JACKSON: Whoa. Let's...

15:45.170 --> 15:46.519
- let's play with that.
- (Enrique chuckles)

15:46.613 --> 15:48.429
MATTY: I mean,
historically, is this something

15:48.448 --> 15:49.855
that Pancho Villa
would have used?

15:49.950 --> 15:52.266
Oh, look at that, yeah,
the old stick of dynamite.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.952
- ENRIQUE: Oh, yeah.
- Pancho Villa would use dynamite.

15:54.103 --> 15:55.936
He loaded up a train one time,
lit it up and sent the train

15:55.956 --> 15:57.455
down the tracks,

15:57.606 --> 15:59.457
took care of what was, uh,
what was down-track.

15:59.684 --> 16:01.108
And this is probably
the most interesting.

16:01.202 --> 16:02.535
- (gasps)
- MARTY: Oh, yeah.

16:02.687 --> 16:04.520
- ENRIQUE: Silver coins.
- MATTY: Oh, wow.

16:04.539 --> 16:06.130
- MARTY: Oh, baby.
- JACKSON: Oh.

16:06.282 --> 16:07.873
- CINDY: I like the sound of that.
- ENRIQUE: And bills.

16:08.026 --> 16:09.801
- Yeah, that does sound nice.
- Doesn't it?

16:09.952 --> 16:11.210
Some bills from the 1900s.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.971
MATTY:
My goodness.

16:13.122 --> 16:14.621
Hold that. That's awesome.

16:14.716 --> 16:16.307
And where was that found?

16:16.459 --> 16:18.701
ENRIQUE: That was inside
here, the soldiers' house.

16:18.720 --> 16:20.052
- MATTY: Look at that.
- MARTY: This is issued

16:20.205 --> 16:22.205
- by the state of Chihuahua.
- MATTY: Really?

16:22.223 --> 16:23.815
MARTY: Yeah, "El Estado
de Chihuahua," right there.

16:23.966 --> 16:26.058
MATTY:
So is this one.

16:26.211 --> 16:28.653
- That's where he was from.
- So could this be

16:28.804 --> 16:30.880
- the so-called Pancho Villa money?
- That is right.

16:30.898 --> 16:32.639
- It is?
- That is right.

16:32.734 --> 16:34.734
He was the governor of Chihuahua
and we have Chihuahua bills.

16:34.828 --> 16:37.386
-Exactly.
-That's-that's... At his stash house.

16:37.405 --> 16:38.997
- JACKSON: At his stash house, yeah.
- Right.

16:39.148 --> 16:41.073
I don't think there's any doubt
that Pancho Villa was here.

16:41.226 --> 16:42.834
- (laughter)
- No. I mean...

16:43.061 --> 16:44.318
- Look...
- I am fully convinced, okay?

16:44.337 --> 16:45.503
MATTY:
Yeah.

16:45.730 --> 16:49.582
If he has found
this much material

16:49.676 --> 16:54.328
in just working here--
And no digging, no technology--

16:54.347 --> 16:57.164
He's just eyeing these things...

16:57.183 --> 16:59.517
I mean, what else can
we find here today?

16:59.744 --> 17:01.594
So, uh, the GPR team
is almost here.

17:01.688 --> 17:04.022
Gypsy will be here, uh,
any minute, so let's get going.

17:04.249 --> 17:05.581
- Let's find you more.
- Let's get it.

17:05.600 --> 17:07.358
- All right.
- Good stuff.

17:07.585 --> 17:10.086
- ENRIQUE: Equipment's here.
- Holy moly.

17:10.104 --> 17:11.937
MATTY (laughs):
That's GPR.

17:12.032 --> 17:14.365
NARRATOR: Rick and
Marty Lagina have arranged

17:14.517 --> 17:16.942
for ground-penetrating radar
specialists John Gallegos

17:17.095 --> 17:20.596
and David Acosta
to join the team

17:20.689 --> 17:22.598
and help search
for any underground voids

17:22.617 --> 17:25.209
or possible treasure caches.

17:25.436 --> 17:27.937
They have also invited
treasure-hunting colleague

17:28.030 --> 17:30.864
- and metal-detection expert Gypsy Jewels...
- Oh, look who's here.

17:30.884 --> 17:32.958
to help look for artifacts

17:33.053 --> 17:36.629
and evidence of Pancho Villa's
activities on the property.

17:36.781 --> 17:38.614
- ENRIQUE: Welcome. - GYPSY: How are y'all?
- MARTY: This is Gypsy.

17:38.633 --> 17:40.449
She's our metal detectorist.

17:40.468 --> 17:43.302
These gentlemen are using
a different technology.

17:43.454 --> 17:44.545
- GYPSY: Sure.
- MARTY: How does this work?

17:44.639 --> 17:46.064
JOHN G.:
Sure, so this is

17:46.291 --> 17:48.215
a, uh, 3D GPR antenna
that allows us

17:48.234 --> 17:50.293
to be able to see
into the ground.

17:50.386 --> 17:53.296
NARRATOR:
The IDS Opera Duo

17:53.314 --> 17:55.740
is a ground-penetrating
radar device

17:55.891 --> 18:00.078
that utilizes 300
and 700-megahertz antennas.

18:00.229 --> 18:03.230
It operates by sending
electromagnetic signals

18:03.324 --> 18:04.990
down into the earth

18:05.143 --> 18:07.234
that, when reflected
back up to the surface,

18:07.253 --> 18:09.161
create an image
that may indicate

18:09.255 --> 18:13.316
the presence of solid objects
or potential voids.

18:13.409 --> 18:15.409
And Gypsy, you're bringing in...

18:15.428 --> 18:17.486
I brought two metal detectors.

18:17.505 --> 18:19.413
Yeah 'cause that one's new.
I haven't seen that

18:19.432 --> 18:20.932
- in your arsenal yet.
- GYPSY: You haven't seen this baby yet.

18:21.083 --> 18:22.992
- (Gypsy laughs)
- I love it. Good.

18:23.085 --> 18:25.919
NARRATOR: To assist in the
search of the surrounding property,

18:25.939 --> 18:30.441
Gypsy has brought along
the GTI 2500 metal detector.

18:30.593 --> 18:33.018
This device
is extremely effective

18:33.113 --> 18:35.780
in finding both nonferrous
and ferrous targets,

18:35.931 --> 18:38.098
like silver and gold,

18:38.118 --> 18:40.785
up to four feet
below the ground.

18:40.936 --> 18:44.697
In addition, it can identify
not only a target's depth

18:44.791 --> 18:46.866
but its size.

18:47.018 --> 18:47.959
MARTY: You know,
Enrique, we're throwing

18:48.110 --> 18:49.443
everything we got at this.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.278
- Yeah, man, look at this.
- I'm looking at this

18:51.297 --> 18:53.447
and it's just amazing.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.191
MARTY:
Well, let's do this.

18:55.209 --> 18:57.468
I'd like to grab these guys.

18:57.695 --> 18:59.528
Let's run that inside
the building first.

18:59.547 --> 19:01.547
You can do your thing out here.

19:01.699 --> 19:04.291
We've got the right tools,
so we're ready to go.

19:04.385 --> 19:05.792
MARTY: All right, let's go
do this. Let's get started.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.295
- Let's find some treasure.
- All right.

19:08.389 --> 19:10.148
MATTY:
Let's find some treasure.

19:16.639 --> 19:18.714
MARTY: -Whoa.
-Whoa, whoa.

19:18.807 --> 19:19.991
Before we get started,
let's-let's just

19:20.142 --> 19:21.475
have a little powwow here.

19:21.569 --> 19:23.235
Here's the plan, I think.

19:23.388 --> 19:24.720
You're gonna fire that thing up.

19:24.739 --> 19:26.889
Let's do this half
of the building first.

19:26.908 --> 19:29.408
That's kind of divided nicely
along this wall.

19:29.502 --> 19:33.654
NARRATOR: In a historic El Paso,
Texas, adobe structure

19:33.748 --> 19:35.489
once used as a stash house

19:35.508 --> 19:38.584
by the famous Mexican
revolutionary Pancho Villa,

19:38.736 --> 19:42.680
Marty Lagina,
property owner Enrique Guajardo

19:42.907 --> 19:45.758
and historian Jackson Polk
have teamed up

19:45.910 --> 19:50.837
with GPR specialists
John Gallegos and David Acosta.

19:50.932 --> 19:54.341
They are about to begin a search
for any evidence of voids

19:54.360 --> 19:56.009
that might have been used
by Villa

19:56.103 --> 19:58.029
more than 100 years ago

19:58.256 --> 20:01.257
as potential hiding places
for treasure.

20:01.275 --> 20:03.759
So, right here we have a known,
and by that, I mean

20:03.778 --> 20:06.946
we have some sort of
hidden hole-- catch,

20:07.040 --> 20:09.523
whatever you want to call it--
Under the floor,

20:09.542 --> 20:12.785
that Enrique already found,
so we're hoping that maybe

20:12.937 --> 20:15.271
there are more of these and
maybe the ones we find elsewhere

20:15.289 --> 20:17.122
- won't be vacant.
- Yeah.

20:17.217 --> 20:19.275
So, you can get that
in your machine, and then,

20:19.293 --> 20:21.277
if we come into something
similar, you'll have it.

20:21.295 --> 20:22.795
- Does that make sense?
- Yeah. No, absolutely.

20:22.947 --> 20:24.447
Well, let's do that.
I'll turn you lose, then.

20:24.465 --> 20:26.799
After that, just do this
whole side of the building.

20:26.951 --> 20:27.874
- Let's see what's here.
- All right, let's...

20:27.969 --> 20:28.893
- Let's take a look.
- Great.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.718
So, this is the type
of signature

20:37.737 --> 20:39.795
that we're going
to be looking at.

20:39.814 --> 20:41.888
- Right here.
- Mm-hmm.

20:41.983 --> 20:43.724
JOHN G.: What we're
looking at is anytime the wave

20:43.743 --> 20:47.245
kind of bounces off of the air,
it creates this signature.

20:47.472 --> 20:50.639
So, look, in terms of the data,
if it looks normal,

20:50.658 --> 20:52.232
it looks kind of like they're
stacked on each other,

20:52.252 --> 20:53.976
which is the normal geophysical
layers of the features

20:54.069 --> 20:56.161
- that you would find on that.
- Mm-hmm.

20:56.314 --> 20:58.739
So, we know it's between,
uh, roughly about

20:58.758 --> 21:00.591
four and a half to about
eight and a half--

21:00.818 --> 21:04.745
Something around four feet,
five feet-ish.

21:04.764 --> 21:07.265
- MARTY: Yeah, it damn sure is.
- Yeah.

21:07.416 --> 21:08.891
Okay, go find another one.

21:11.345 --> 21:12.937
To my knowledge, uh, nothing

21:13.164 --> 21:16.332
of any sort
of scientific methodology

21:16.350 --> 21:18.258
has been used
on this house at all.

21:18.278 --> 21:20.093
And that includes
ground-penetrating radar

21:20.187 --> 21:21.946
and even metal detecting.

21:22.097 --> 21:23.930
All right, let's-let's take a
pass right parallel going back.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.449
Sure.

21:25.676 --> 21:27.118
The easy stuff's
already been found.

21:27.269 --> 21:30.012
The stuff that Enrique and
his team found by cleaning up,

21:30.031 --> 21:32.105
that's already in their pocket.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.774
Now we're gonna bring
the technology

21:33.793 --> 21:36.752
that might be able to sense
where the hidden stuff is.

21:37.872 --> 21:39.522
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:39.615 --> 21:40.965
- What happened?
- What do you got?

21:41.116 --> 21:41.799
DAVID A.: Whoa, it's definitely
getting something there.

21:42.026 --> 21:43.116
Oh, my God.

21:43.136 --> 21:44.877
JACKSON:
That looks different.

21:45.029 --> 21:46.045
- MARTY: That looks real different.
- DAVID A.: Now, this is,

21:46.197 --> 21:47.954
this is a little bit wider.

21:47.974 --> 21:50.032
That's something there,
for sure.

21:50.051 --> 21:53.035
It looks like it's maybe
about four feet wide or so.

21:53.128 --> 21:55.796
Here's-here's one end of it.

21:55.815 --> 21:58.799
Even the data is showing,
more or less,

21:58.818 --> 22:01.877
that it's about four feet wide,
this way.

22:01.970 --> 22:03.395
It's not right up against
the wall, then,

22:03.489 --> 22:05.214
- like the other one, either, right?
- No, no.

22:05.232 --> 22:06.157
This one isn't.

22:08.977 --> 22:12.905
Our preliminary analysis
of the anomaly

22:13.057 --> 22:16.408
is that it is
a little bit bigger aerially

22:16.561 --> 22:18.060
than the two that have
already been found,

22:18.153 --> 22:20.671
and also, it might be deeper.

22:20.898 --> 22:23.674
All right,
so, us being human beings,

22:23.826 --> 22:26.344
we jump to the conclusion
that this is the mother lode.

22:26.495 --> 22:30.330
So, this could be the one that
he left behind undisturbed.

22:30.350 --> 22:32.257
We're pretty excited about it.

22:32.410 --> 22:34.352
NARRATOR:
As Marty and the GPR team

22:34.503 --> 22:37.855
begin to mark out the perimeter
of a potential target site

22:38.082 --> 22:41.007
inside the Pancho Villa
Stash House,

22:41.102 --> 22:44.937
Matty Blake, along with metal
detection expert Gypsy Jewels

22:45.031 --> 22:48.014
scan the property outside
the building in a search

22:48.034 --> 22:51.260
for any valuable artifacts
that may have once belonged

22:51.353 --> 22:54.113
to the legendary
Mexican revolutionary.

22:54.265 --> 22:56.356
(beeping)

22:56.376 --> 22:58.434
GYPSY: Hey, y'all,
here's a signal right here.

22:58.452 --> 23:00.044
(long beep)

23:00.271 --> 23:01.379
- Right about there.
- MATTY: Right there?

23:03.716 --> 23:05.791
- Ooh, hard. Oh, man, yeah.
- (laughs)

23:05.943 --> 23:08.219
I mean, it's almost like
digging through stone.

23:09.872 --> 23:11.964
- Working up a sweat, Matty?
- Already.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.966
- How's that?
- GYPSY: Now you're getting it down there.

23:14.118 --> 23:15.134
(beeping)

23:15.228 --> 23:16.560
We got it.

23:19.399 --> 23:21.899
- You ready for this?
- Let's go.

23:22.050 --> 23:23.067
This is what we came here for,
Cindy. I love this moment.

23:23.294 --> 23:24.235
Ooh!

23:26.130 --> 23:28.739
MATTY:
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:28.966 --> 23:32.635
That is a coin.
It is caked in mud.

23:32.653 --> 23:35.079
Hold on. Hold on.

23:35.230 --> 23:36.062
Do we have any water-- oh,
I don't want to put water on it.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.397
Here.

23:37.491 --> 23:38.916
This is old, Gypsy.

23:39.143 --> 23:40.709
GYPSY:
Actually, I think it is a coin.

23:42.070 --> 23:44.422
A piece of rock
has formed on it.

23:44.649 --> 23:45.497
- Mm-hmm.
- If we try to clean this any more,

23:45.650 --> 23:46.649
- we're gonna damage it.
- Mm-hmm.

23:46.742 --> 23:48.092
- Right.
- So, let's pocket that,

23:48.243 --> 23:49.743
and then we'll, uh,
we'll get it,

23:49.762 --> 23:52.004
we'll get it looked at
with something.

23:52.156 --> 23:53.597
MARTY:
Hey, Matty! Gypsy.

23:53.824 --> 23:54.990
- Come on in. We need you.
- GYPSY: Oh, okay.

23:55.009 --> 23:57.826
MATTY:
I like when he sounds excited.

23:57.920 --> 24:00.329
- Here, ladies first.
- CINDY: Thank you.

24:00.347 --> 24:02.498
MARTY: Look at this.
Look what we got here.

24:02.591 --> 24:04.850
- Look at that.
- GYPSY: Oh.

24:05.002 --> 24:07.670
MARTY:
Hard data, too. Hard data.

24:07.688 --> 24:10.448
These guys are pretty sure
that there is a void,

24:10.675 --> 24:12.098
and we're hoping you might
shed some light on it

24:12.118 --> 24:13.600
before we cut it.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.453
- This is exciting, y'all.
- It's fantastic.

24:15.680 --> 24:18.697
Crank that thing up.
Let's see what that thing says.

24:18.849 --> 24:20.791
GYPSY: I'm going to
walk down the center here.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.186
(device whirring)

24:24.279 --> 24:25.704
- MATTY: Whoa. Oh.
- (laughter)

24:25.856 --> 24:27.873
Wow, wow.

24:28.025 --> 24:30.526
- (whirring) - It starts
again right on the box.

24:30.544 --> 24:31.802
It's right on it.

24:31.954 --> 24:32.970
GYPSY:
That is an awesome confirmation

24:33.197 --> 24:34.363
right there.

24:34.456 --> 24:36.289
- I've got chills.
- (laughter)

24:36.309 --> 24:38.291
MATTY:
Something's under there.

24:38.311 --> 24:41.479
- GYPSY: This is exciting.
- DAVID A.: It's pretty cool.

24:45.651 --> 24:48.134
-(de JOHN G.:

24:48.154 --> 24:50.212
- Right.
- NARRATOR: In El Paso, Texas,

24:50.305 --> 24:52.715
Marty Lagina and Matty Blake,

24:52.733 --> 24:55.326
along with treasure hunters
Jackson Polk

24:55.477 --> 24:56.827
and Enrique Guajardo

24:56.979 --> 24:59.980
and metal detection expert
Gypsy Jewels

24:59.999 --> 25:02.148
have just discovered
evidence of a void

25:02.168 --> 25:05.669
and metal objects beneath
the floor of the stash house

25:05.821 --> 25:10.582
once used by the famed Mexican
revolutionary Pancho Villa.

25:10.735 --> 25:14.903
GYPSY: There is definitely a
fairly large object right there.

25:14.997 --> 25:17.330
- That's right on the box.
- MARTY: Mm-hmm.

25:17.350 --> 25:18.907
But Gypsy,
you're sure it's metal?

25:19.001 --> 25:20.759
This machine would not go off

25:20.911 --> 25:22.186
unless there was
some metal in there, so...

25:22.413 --> 25:24.079
Oh, my Go--
And that's a big bunch of metal.

25:24.172 --> 25:26.415
There's something
big right there.

25:26.508 --> 25:28.433
- MARTY: Well, we're gonna find out soon.
- ENRIQUE: How about this,

25:28.586 --> 25:29.843
- let's get it out.
- Yeah. - (laughter)

25:29.862 --> 25:31.420
MARTY: How about
we quit guessing?

25:31.438 --> 25:33.013
ENRIQUE: Yeah. Let's go,
let's go for it.

25:33.032 --> 25:34.606
MARTY: Let's go get
the cutter. Let's go.

25:34.759 --> 25:36.091
- We'll be back.
- All right.

25:36.110 --> 25:37.442
MARTY: We'll get the
heck out of your way.

25:37.537 --> 25:40.596
- We're this close.
- Good job. The new toy paid off.

25:40.614 --> 25:42.331
We've done the house,
let's go do the yard.

25:45.119 --> 25:48.103
MATTY: We've got to get the same
technology we used in the house

25:48.196 --> 25:50.622
outside the house
to this back lot.

25:50.775 --> 25:53.125
We're got to run a grid pattern
GPR survey,

25:53.219 --> 25:56.036
look at the data,
and see if there's any targets.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.279
- Here you go.
- All right.

25:57.372 --> 26:00.132
MATTY:
I.e., voids, spaces,

26:00.284 --> 26:03.209
perfectly square objects,
things like that.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.470
We can identify the targets
and then hopefully dig.

26:05.623 --> 26:08.065
Well, it looks like we do have
something here, gentlemen.

26:08.216 --> 26:09.975
And look at this scan
right here.

26:10.127 --> 26:12.477
We got a anomaly right there.

26:12.630 --> 26:14.721
This is a dark indication

26:14.815 --> 26:16.315
- that there is obviously something there.
- MARTY: Oh, yeah.

26:16.467 --> 26:18.725
- What do you think?
- It's an anomalous, anyway.

26:18.744 --> 26:21.745
Yeah. I would recommend
the digging commence right here.

26:24.658 --> 26:26.417
"X" marks the spot.

26:26.568 --> 26:28.735
- Is this the only anomaly?
- Well, I think, uh,

26:28.754 --> 26:30.646
it wouldn't hurt to take another
pass in this direction.

26:30.664 --> 26:32.089
Please.

26:43.251 --> 26:44.751
Well, hey, it looks like we, uh,

26:44.770 --> 26:46.845
got another point of interest
here, guys.

26:46.997 --> 26:49.348
- Really?
- Kind of the same signature as we're seeing over there.

26:49.442 --> 26:51.609
MARTY:
Oh, yes.

26:51.760 --> 26:54.686
Mark it, please. Yeah, I mean,
it's kind of looking like

26:54.780 --> 26:55.779
there might have been
a series of tunnels here,

26:55.931 --> 26:56.839
maybe partially filled in.

26:56.932 --> 26:58.598
CINDY:
Villa used tunnels,

26:58.618 --> 27:02.102
you know, to store weapons,
ammunition, money, escape.

27:02.196 --> 27:04.529
- Mm.
- You know, the one at La Quinta Luz in Chihuahua City

27:04.624 --> 27:07.366
was big enough to even
ride horses underneath.

27:07.460 --> 27:08.350
- Okay. Well, that's...
- Huh. - CINDY: Yeah.

27:08.443 --> 27:10.127
He could've done that here.

27:10.278 --> 27:12.463
Is this a tunnel
running along the outside

27:12.614 --> 27:14.614
the back of the house?

27:14.634 --> 27:17.117
The other thing I see
is that the first target

27:17.136 --> 27:20.804
seems to line up with the hole
dug in the Stash House.

27:21.031 --> 27:24.383
So is that a tunnel?
Do we have a tunnel system now?

27:24.535 --> 27:26.551
It's definitely possible.

27:26.704 --> 27:30.038
NARRATOR:
During the Mexican Revolution,

27:30.057 --> 27:32.132
Pancho Villa's use
of elaborate tunnel systems

27:32.226 --> 27:33.984
is well-documented.

27:34.136 --> 27:37.821
For his estate in Chihuahua,
purchased in 1911,

27:37.973 --> 27:40.306
and which is now
the Historical Museum

27:40.401 --> 27:42.159
of the Mexican Revolution,

27:42.310 --> 27:44.477
Villa commissioned
elaborate tunnels

27:44.571 --> 27:47.055
to be built under the property.

27:47.074 --> 27:50.575
Constructed from brick,
cement and sandy clay,

27:50.670 --> 27:54.338
he used the tunnels to secretly
hide and move soldiers,

27:54.565 --> 27:58.233
weapons, provisions
and even horses,

27:58.252 --> 28:00.326
along with the riches
he accumulated

28:00.346 --> 28:03.922
during the course of his
numerous heists and robberies.

28:04.016 --> 28:07.259
Is it possible that the team
has now found evidence

28:07.411 --> 28:10.913
of tunnels on this property,
where Pancho Villa was known

28:10.931 --> 28:14.007
to have hidden valuables
more than a century ago?

28:14.026 --> 28:16.601
I would find it hard to believe
that a place he spent

28:16.754 --> 28:19.846
this much time at he wouldn't
have some sort of escape plan.

28:19.940 --> 28:22.758
- Right? Yeah. - He had to.
- Okay, well, let's find it out.

28:22.851 --> 28:24.368
MATTY:
All right, let's go.

28:26.780 --> 28:28.354
(beeping)

28:28.374 --> 28:30.599
JACKSON:
Oh, my God, what does he have?

28:30.617 --> 28:32.710
Well, that's a serious machine.

28:32.937 --> 28:34.527
MATTY:
It's not really a treasure hunt

28:34.547 --> 28:36.621
until Marty Lagina
is in an excavator.

28:36.774 --> 28:38.273
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.
- (cheering)

28:38.292 --> 28:39.717
Now forward, yep.

28:39.868 --> 28:41.944
Cool as a cucumber!

28:41.962 --> 28:43.387
- (laughter)
- Oh, yeah, baby.

28:43.614 --> 28:44.871
- ENRIQUE: Perfect.
- (cheering, applause)

28:44.965 --> 28:46.372
- Hey, hey.
- That wasn't easy.

28:46.392 --> 28:47.558
JACKSON:
Success.

28:49.453 --> 28:51.061
JACKSON:
Scoop number one coming up.

28:51.213 --> 28:53.230
- Oh, yeah.
- MATTY: Hey,

28:53.381 --> 28:56.124
we've broken ground
at Pancho Villa's Stash House.

28:56.143 --> 28:58.402
- (cheering, applause)
<i>- Viva</i> Villa!<i> Viva</i> Villa.

29:00.631 --> 29:01.905
- Wait, there's a brick.
- You see, there's...

29:02.057 --> 29:04.057
GYPSY:
That's a brick.

29:04.076 --> 29:05.968
- Different-colored dirt.
- I think there's something there.

29:05.986 --> 29:07.077
Right there.

29:08.563 --> 29:10.080
You think that's a coin?

29:10.232 --> 29:11.823
Oh, my God,
it does look like a coin.

29:11.917 --> 29:13.733
JOHN G.:
Where?

29:13.827 --> 29:15.494
- MATTY: You see a coin?
- It is. - GYPSY: It's a coin.

29:15.646 --> 29:16.736
- Really?
- MATTY: Right there.

29:16.756 --> 29:18.905
- Wow.
- And it's got a green patina.

29:18.999 --> 29:20.090
Wait, you just found that?

29:20.317 --> 29:21.666
You two just found that
with your eyes?

29:21.761 --> 29:23.986
Well, we both kind of saw it
at the same time.

29:24.004 --> 29:26.096
- JACKSON: it came out from a pretty far depth.
- Oh, it is smaller, yes.

29:26.323 --> 29:28.081
MARTY:
What is that? What is it, Gypsy?

29:28.100 --> 29:29.582
- ENRIQUE: Wow.
- MATTY: Is that an eagle?

29:29.602 --> 29:32.418
Oh, it is a foreign coin,
I think.

29:32.438 --> 29:35.831
- MATTY: See the ridging around the end?
- Yes.

29:35.849 --> 29:38.108
It's got a lot of patina, Marty.
It's green.

29:38.260 --> 29:39.684
More than likely copper.

29:39.837 --> 29:41.427
- MATTY: I know what this is.
- JACKSON: What?

29:41.447 --> 29:43.505
MATTY:
That would be a Mexican penny,

29:43.524 --> 29:45.023
- my friends. - Ah.
- Mm-hmm.

29:45.175 --> 29:46.024
- And there's...
- "Centavo."

29:46.176 --> 29:48.101
It's got the "C" for "centavo."

29:48.195 --> 29:49.344
- JACKSON: Okay.
- The wreath.

29:49.437 --> 29:50.954
GYPSY:
Can you see a date?

29:51.181 --> 29:52.864
CINDY: It's hard to
tell what's back here.

29:52.958 --> 29:54.792
GYPSY:
May I check?

29:55.019 --> 29:56.126
It is...

29:56.278 --> 29:57.686
Can you read a word?

29:57.704 --> 30:00.631
- 1905.
- (whooping, cheering)

30:00.782 --> 30:03.300
We're on the trail
of Pancho Villa!

30:03.527 --> 30:05.803
That puts it right
in the time frame we want it.

30:05.954 --> 30:09.122
CINDY: Finding a 1905
coin is sig-significant to us,

30:09.141 --> 30:11.049
especially here
at the Villa Stash House,

30:11.201 --> 30:13.293
'cause when the raid happened,
that was 1915.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.203
Even though the coin
is from 1905,

30:15.222 --> 30:18.131
that was in circulation,
so that could have been dropped

30:18.150 --> 30:19.558
by one of the Mexican
revolutionaries

30:19.710 --> 30:21.652
visiting the house at the time.

30:21.879 --> 30:23.469
Quite frankly,
that could have fallen

30:23.489 --> 30:25.322
out of Pancho Villa's pocket.

30:25.549 --> 30:27.732
- That can't be the Lone Ranger.
- (laughter)

30:27.885 --> 30:30.218
It can't be the Lone Ranger.

30:30.237 --> 30:31.887
I think, Gypsy,
you should metal-detect that

30:31.980 --> 30:33.664
and then I'm gonna keep digging.

30:33.815 --> 30:35.574
- All right. - Perfect, sounds like a plan.
- MARTY: Get it.

30:35.726 --> 30:37.167
(beeping)

30:40.747 --> 30:41.988
JACKSON:
There's bricks.

30:42.007 --> 30:43.340
There is a ton of bricks
coming up.

30:47.738 --> 30:49.237
All right, now,
watch that ground.

30:49.331 --> 30:51.515
This is gonna fill in fast.

30:51.666 --> 30:53.909
I'm not seeing
anything but earth.

30:53.927 --> 30:56.002
JACKSON:
That's just dirt.

30:56.021 --> 30:58.504
MARTY:
Yeah, I think this is backfill.

30:58.599 --> 31:01.416
-It's soft. I think-- and-and that's why...
-MATTY: Yeah.

31:01.435 --> 31:03.935
- there's so much junk in it.
- Junk, yeah.

31:04.088 --> 31:06.088
MARTY: As I start digging with
the excavator on the anomaly,

31:06.181 --> 31:07.923
it's clear I'm in
disturbed soil.

31:07.941 --> 31:10.092
Initially, I'm a little
disappointed, frankly,

31:10.110 --> 31:12.777
because it looks like
more modern things than period

31:12.872 --> 31:14.262
for Pancho Villa.

31:14.356 --> 31:15.873
But I'm gonna keep digging.

31:16.024 --> 31:17.190
I'm gonna dig as long
as I'm here

31:17.209 --> 31:19.601
because this stuff
could've been filled

31:19.620 --> 31:21.453
over what we see.

31:21.547 --> 31:23.438
GYPSY:
I got something.

31:23.457 --> 31:25.716
You got something?
Hold on, she's got something.

31:26.944 --> 31:28.218
Look.

31:30.114 --> 31:31.446
- Right there.
- What is that?

31:31.465 --> 31:32.705
It's got a nice
green patina to it.

31:32.725 --> 31:34.449
MATTY:
Oh, my God, it's bright green.

31:34.468 --> 31:35.800
JACKSON:
What is it?

31:35.895 --> 31:37.060
I don't know.

31:43.569 --> 31:44.643
MARTY:
We need to dig this out.

31:44.737 --> 31:45.718
- You guys ready?
- Yep.

31:45.812 --> 31:46.811
JOHN G.:
I'm just gonna probe it.

31:46.964 --> 31:48.363
- Whoa.
- Look at that.

31:49.909 --> 31:51.575
- JACKSON: Oh, what is that?
- MARTY: What you got?

31:58.142 --> 31:59.750
At is that? - GYPSY: Right there.
- MATTY: Wh

31:59.901 --> 32:01.309
GYPSY: It's got a
nice green patina to it.

32:01.328 --> 32:02.994
MATTY:
Oh, my God, it's bright green.

32:03.147 --> 32:06.148
NARRATOR: In El Paso, Texas,
on the grounds of a hideout

32:06.166 --> 32:10.485
once used by the Mexican
revolutionary Pancho Villa,

32:10.504 --> 32:12.078
Marty Lagina, Matty Blake

32:12.097 --> 32:14.656
and metal detection expert
Gypsy Jewels...

32:14.675 --> 32:17.159
- Is that a design?
- I think it might be.

32:17.177 --> 32:19.661
NARRATOR: have just
made an intriguing find.

32:19.680 --> 32:21.830
- GYPSY: It's a button.
- MATTY: Oh, it is.

32:21.848 --> 32:27.519
And it is looking like
a military button of that era.

32:27.671 --> 32:30.672
MATTY: I completely
agree, 'cause that is...

32:30.691 --> 32:32.115
- GYPSY: That is a shank.
- that is a shank.

32:32.267 --> 32:33.508
This is great. Great find.

32:33.601 --> 32:35.844
- All right.
- Awesome.

32:35.862 --> 32:38.604
MATTY:
This is a military-type button

32:38.699 --> 32:42.960
with what we believe to be, at
this point, an American design.

32:43.187 --> 32:44.777
And it appears to be
from the time frame

32:44.797 --> 32:45.870
that Pancho Villa was back here.

32:45.965 --> 32:48.206
Now, we know for a fact,

32:48.300 --> 32:51.042
Pancho Villa was wheeling and
dealing with American officials.

32:51.195 --> 32:53.453
So did we just find evidence

32:53.547 --> 32:56.865
of Pancho Villa cutting a deal
with an American official

32:56.883 --> 32:58.958
in his own backyard
of his own stash house?

32:58.978 --> 33:01.720
- Marty, hell of a job digging.
- Yeah, well,

33:01.814 --> 33:03.888
- you know, I made some hole, that's for sure.
- You did.

33:03.983 --> 33:05.649
MARTY: But we need to go in
and check on these other guys

33:05.876 --> 33:06.875
- and see how they're doing.
- MATTY: Okay.

33:06.968 --> 33:08.468
- So, let's do that.
- MATTY: Great.

33:08.487 --> 33:10.712
All right, let's see
what these guys are-- Oh.

33:10.805 --> 33:12.638
I like it.

33:12.733 --> 33:14.974
- Whoa. That was fast.
- It's cut up.

33:15.068 --> 33:16.901
JACKSON:
We got her all cut.

33:16.996 --> 33:19.070
All right, well, are we gonna
try and knock it out with that?

33:19.164 --> 33:20.555
What do you think, Marty, you
want to give it the first shot?

33:20.648 --> 33:22.057
I'll give it a try. All right.

33:22.075 --> 33:24.317
If I look bad,
then I'll hand it to you.

33:24.336 --> 33:25.502
(laughs)

33:28.582 --> 33:29.914
MARTY:
Come on, baby.

33:30.067 --> 33:32.325
We need to break this floor
out of here.

33:32.344 --> 33:33.493
We need to get the floor removed

33:33.512 --> 33:34.903
so we can get down
to this anomaly

33:34.996 --> 33:36.638
that might be
the treasure trove.

33:38.166 --> 33:39.599
JACKSON:
Oh, yeah.

33:40.835 --> 33:42.427
I look around,

33:42.521 --> 33:45.188
there's no way to get that--
Even a mini-excavator in here.

33:45.340 --> 33:48.150
Which means this is gonna be
sledgehammer work.

33:50.937 --> 33:53.697
- There we go.
- JACKSON: Number one.

33:53.924 --> 33:55.991
(beeping)

34:04.192 --> 34:06.117
GYPSY: You know, I am
getting a low signal here.

34:06.211 --> 34:08.295
- There's something definitely really small.
- MATTY: Okay.

34:11.032 --> 34:13.884
GYPSY: So, Matty,
about right-right there.

34:15.946 --> 34:16.945
MATTY: God, it's tiny,
whatever it is, 'cause...

34:17.038 --> 34:18.296
All right, Matty, here we go.

34:18.390 --> 34:19.556
I'll hold this.

34:24.638 --> 34:25.896
GYPSY:
I see it.

34:27.974 --> 34:29.641
You know, look at this.

34:29.793 --> 34:31.960
So that right there

34:32.053 --> 34:35.405
looks like a tiny piece
of an old bullet casing.

34:35.557 --> 34:38.241
- It sure does. It's...
- So, it would have been

34:38.468 --> 34:39.801
- when they fired a bullet...
- CINDY: Mm-hmm.

34:39.820 --> 34:42.153
some of the little pieces
of the bullet casing...

34:42.306 --> 34:44.230
- CINDY: Explode.
- explode.

34:44.324 --> 34:46.141
GYPSY: Now you see that
little bit of green patina on there.

34:46.159 --> 34:48.067
- MATTY: Yeah.
- It's got a little age to it.

34:48.087 --> 34:50.420
- MATTY: Yeah.
- Who knows?

34:50.647 --> 34:51.663
- Pancho Villa might have...
- (imitates gunshots)

34:51.757 --> 34:53.832
shot that very bullet.

34:53.984 --> 34:56.151
Some celebratory, uh,
firing in the air?

34:56.244 --> 34:58.486
- (laughs)
- Yeah, that's awesome.

34:58.505 --> 35:00.430
MATTY: Gypsy pulls
up this little piece

35:00.582 --> 35:02.157
of what she thinks
and what I agree is

35:02.250 --> 35:03.767
a piece of a bullet fragment.

35:03.994 --> 35:05.585
Corroborating the fact
that soldiers lived

35:05.679 --> 35:06.845
right next to where we were.

35:06.997 --> 35:09.013
So did someone fire
that gun in the air?

35:09.108 --> 35:10.682
I don't know,
but it's that type of thing

35:10.834 --> 35:12.667
that brings history alive for me
when I hold an object like that.

35:12.686 --> 35:14.686
I just start telling
those stories in my head

35:14.780 --> 35:16.780
and it validates it in a way.

35:17.007 --> 35:19.074
(indistinct chatter)

35:23.288 --> 35:25.180
MARTY:
Have a probe, John.

35:25.273 --> 35:26.439
- JOHN G.: You guys ready?
- DAVID A.: Yep.

35:26.533 --> 35:27.682
DAVID A.:
All right, let's probe it.

35:27.701 --> 35:29.609
- Whoa.
- Look at that.

35:29.703 --> 35:31.277
DAVID A.:
He went way down in there.

35:31.296 --> 35:33.279
JOHN G.:
Let's see, we got about...

35:33.298 --> 35:36.691
it's about 40--
It looks about three feet?

35:36.710 --> 35:38.951
It's-it's not consolidated
or compacted.

35:38.971 --> 35:41.954
It's as if somebody
put some fill on there

35:42.048 --> 35:43.306
and just covered it up.

35:43.533 --> 35:45.308
I'll tell you what's clear,
we're not done here.

35:45.460 --> 35:47.552
We need to dig this out,
because if it is backfill,

35:47.704 --> 35:49.537
there could be
a crate down there, right?

35:49.556 --> 35:51.648
I mean, that-that's what you do,
you dig a hole.

35:51.799 --> 35:53.799
You tell your men, dig a hole,
put the crate in it,

35:53.819 --> 35:54.818
bury it back.

35:55.045 --> 35:56.878
ENRIQUE:
See?

35:56.971 --> 35:59.047
- It's getting easier.
- ALL: Whoa!

35:59.140 --> 36:00.991
- How about that?
- Look at this.

36:01.218 --> 36:02.325
Cool.

36:02.477 --> 36:04.310
MATTY:
So, where do we stand right now?

36:04.329 --> 36:05.737
We broke through that.

36:05.889 --> 36:10.333
John, um, probed it,
he feels like it's fill.

36:10.485 --> 36:12.394
- Well, that's interesting.
- JOHN G.: Yeah, it's super, super soft.

36:12.412 --> 36:14.245
We got the probe in
about 36 inches.

36:14.398 --> 36:16.414
MATTY: I mean, it doesn't
seem really natural to me.

36:16.566 --> 36:18.175
- Does it to you?
- It doesn't.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.344
- JACKSON: Oh, what is that?
- MARTY: What you got?

36:24.499 --> 36:26.850
I can tell that
"I got something" look, Matty.

36:31.765 --> 36:33.765
- What is it? Let's see.
- That looks old, doesn't it?

36:33.859 --> 36:36.008
It's a big spike, eh?

36:36.102 --> 36:37.085
Look at the head.

36:37.178 --> 36:39.529
JACKSON:
Is that a screwdriver?

36:39.756 --> 36:42.014
No, it's not a screwdriver,
that's a spike.

36:42.034 --> 36:42.848
- What the hell's that doing here?
- And it looks like it's made

36:42.868 --> 36:44.092
by a blacksmith.

36:44.110 --> 36:45.760
Yeah, so this looks
like it could've

36:45.853 --> 36:47.595
belonged in a big timber
at some point.

36:47.614 --> 36:49.597
That's encouraging, Matty,
you know?

36:49.616 --> 36:51.433
I mean, h-here's where
I'm at with this.

36:51.526 --> 36:53.359
I'm not usually given
to speculation,

36:53.453 --> 36:55.528
but I'm gonna do it.

36:55.547 --> 36:58.957
You dig a hole, maybe
there's a chest down there.

36:59.051 --> 37:01.701
If you're just digging a hole,
then you backfill it.

37:01.795 --> 37:03.720
And w-we're just not there yet.

37:03.871 --> 37:07.224
I-I think, if I were you--
This would be my advice--

37:07.375 --> 37:08.558
I wouldn't quit until this
is a four-foot hole

37:08.785 --> 37:09.951
all the way around.

37:09.970 --> 37:11.119
Four-foot deep, I mean.

37:11.137 --> 37:12.954
ENRIQUE:
Okay, we got to do it, then.

37:12.973 --> 37:15.065
MARTY: It's one thing to know
from books that Pancho Villa

37:15.216 --> 37:18.235
was here, but it's another
to prove it yourself, right?

37:18.462 --> 37:21.238
- And I think we did.
- I agree. Totally. 100%.

37:21.465 --> 37:22.814
We didn't find exactly
what we were looking for,

37:22.966 --> 37:25.725
uh, but I'd say, for today,

37:25.744 --> 37:27.393
- we're done.
- MATTY: Okay.

37:27.412 --> 37:30.989
MATTY: We didn't find
Pancho Villa's treasure.

37:31.083 --> 37:34.158
We didn't find gold bars
or silver bars or gold coins.

37:34.253 --> 37:35.901
But that's okay, honestly,
'cause as Marty always says,

37:35.921 --> 37:37.587
you have to eliminate targets.

37:37.814 --> 37:40.573
I think Enrique needs to keep
going and I know he will.

37:40.667 --> 37:42.241
MARTY: You know, Matty
and I are gonna have to go

37:42.335 --> 37:44.652
on to the next adventure
for now,

37:44.746 --> 37:45.929
but you will keep us
appraised, right?

37:46.156 --> 37:47.079
- I mean, you're not done.
- ENRIQUE: Of course.

37:47.173 --> 37:48.506
Oh, no, we're not done.

37:48.600 --> 37:49.657
Oh, no, we're gonna
keep digging for sure.

37:49.676 --> 37:51.083
- Okay.
- Yeah.

37:51.103 --> 37:53.919
What you have found
with just your naked eye,

37:53.939 --> 37:56.831
there is no doubt
you're gonna find more.

37:56.924 --> 38:00.092
Okay, well, I will say,
thank you, young lady.

38:00.112 --> 38:01.761
- It was a pleasure.
- My pleasure meeting you.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.113
I'm sure our paths will cross.

38:03.264 --> 38:04.614
- Thank you,<i> señor.</i>
- Jackson.

38:04.841 --> 38:06.432
- Yes, Cindy.
- Great meeting you.

38:06.451 --> 38:08.359
MARTY:
Good job, everybody.

38:08.512 --> 38:09.911
- Good stuff.
- (applause)

38:16.795 --> 38:20.279
MARTY: Enr

38:20.299 --> 38:22.632
that he had preserved,
which were very intriguing,

38:22.784 --> 38:25.527
and we brought in a
ground-penetrating radar crew

38:25.545 --> 38:29.139
and we covered every, every bit
of that site with that.

38:29.290 --> 38:31.883
We covered the inside the place
and outside the place.

38:32.035 --> 38:35.053
- Oh, you did, yeah?
- But we never really got the backyard excavated

38:35.147 --> 38:36.220
as much as we wanted to.

38:36.315 --> 38:38.130
We-we ran out of time.

38:38.224 --> 38:39.816
Enrique is a great guy.

38:39.967 --> 38:41.543
- MATTY: Such a great guy.
- The energy of that guy.

38:41.561 --> 38:43.153
MATTY:
He's unbelievable.

38:43.304 --> 38:46.064
He went from, you know, always
welcoming, "Yeah, go ahead,"

38:46.216 --> 38:47.324
and then he was like, "Let's go.

38:47.551 --> 38:48.808
Let's keep digging,
let's keep digging."

38:48.827 --> 38:50.643
You've been in contact
with him, right?

38:50.737 --> 38:52.645
MATTY: Yes, he's telling me
that he's got an update for us,

38:52.739 --> 38:54.647
so I'm actually really excited.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.499
- D-Do you have him standing by?
- I do.

39:00.154 --> 39:01.320
MARTY:
Hello, Enrique. How are you?

39:01.414 --> 39:03.006
<i>Hey, how are you guys?</i>

39:03.157 --> 39:05.416
- Good.
- MATTY: It's great to see you again, my friend.

39:05.569 --> 39:06.992
We had a blast.
We were just filling Rick in

39:07.012 --> 39:08.178
on the whole trip.

39:08.329 --> 39:09.512
I've heard nothing
but good things

39:09.664 --> 39:11.330
about you and your efforts
down there.

39:11.424 --> 39:14.092
Yes, yes, definitely it was,
it was a great experience

39:14.244 --> 39:16.077
for-for us as well.

39:16.096 --> 39:17.354
<i>I mean, it was incredible.</i>

39:17.505 --> 39:18.688
MARTY:
We're wondering,

39:18.915 --> 39:20.523
have you kept digging
since we left?

39:20.675 --> 39:22.484
- Have you found anything?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

39:23.937 --> 39:25.010
<i>We dig, like,</i>

39:25.105 --> 39:26.604
about two days more.

39:26.756 --> 39:28.198
<i>We have a c-- you know,
a couple items.</i>

39:28.349 --> 39:29.682
I have them here with me,
I don't know if you guys...

39:29.701 --> 39:31.517
- MARTY: Yeah, let's see.
- Yeah, definitely.

39:31.536 --> 39:34.112
<i>We got a couple of bottles.</i>

39:34.264 --> 39:37.432
MATTY:
Oh, that's beautiful.

39:37.450 --> 39:39.617
Can we see the bottom
of that bottle, please?

39:39.769 --> 39:41.544
Yeah, it has a huge hole.

39:41.696 --> 39:43.529
- Wow.
- MATTY: Wow.

39:43.623 --> 39:45.607
That can easily be dated.

39:45.700 --> 39:47.792
You should, you should
have that done.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.944
Yeah, I have, like,
a hundred, a hundred bottles.

39:49.963 --> 39:52.113
<i>Here's another bottle.</i>

39:52.132 --> 39:53.556
<i>I think this is a very cool one.</i>

39:55.894 --> 39:58.119
Oh, that's beautiful.

39:58.138 --> 39:59.229
- Oh, my goodness.
- RICK: What the heck is that?

39:59.380 --> 40:01.213
MATTY:
It's ornate.

40:01.307 --> 40:03.641
- That could have been for one of his wives.
<i>- Yep.</i>

40:03.793 --> 40:06.144
<i>And then this is a plate
where they used to eat.</i>

40:06.238 --> 40:09.239
- MARTY: Oh, yeah.
- MATTY: Wow, that's incredible.

40:09.466 --> 40:10.740
- That's cool.
- That could be, you know--

40:10.967 --> 40:12.817
You said the soldiers
were back there, you know,

40:12.969 --> 40:15.412
you could see them having their
rations on something like that.

40:17.157 --> 40:18.564
How deep were those finds?

40:18.583 --> 40:21.142
These were between
four and five feet.

40:21.235 --> 40:22.735
Yeah, I-I'd say keep digging.

40:22.754 --> 40:25.070
- Think of Rome, right?
- MARTY: Yeah.

40:25.090 --> 40:29.150
Current streets of Rome
are probably 20 feet above...

40:29.169 --> 40:30.985
- They are.
- areas of significant interest

40:31.078 --> 40:34.172
where-where Rome
"originally was."

40:34.324 --> 40:37.492
I would keep digging
until you've found nothing.

40:37.510 --> 40:39.177
That's what I would do.

40:39.329 --> 40:41.438
My brother wants to bring in
a bigger excavator, Enrique.

40:41.665 --> 40:42.939
- You okay with that?
- (chuckles): Oh, no, no.

40:43.166 --> 40:45.108
Oh, yeah, you know,
we need to find the gold.

40:45.335 --> 40:47.001
We need to find that treasure,
you know?

40:47.020 --> 40:48.778
That's what, that's what
we're here for.

40:48.930 --> 40:51.506
I just have the-the biggest
feeling in my, in my heart,

40:51.599 --> 40:53.357
there's something in there.

40:53.452 --> 40:55.285
There's no way

40:55.436 --> 40:57.937
<i>that Pancho Villa
could have left</i>

40:57.956 --> 41:00.198
that property without even
hiding something, you know?

41:00.350 --> 41:02.942
<i>So I have a huge, strong feeling</i>

41:02.961 --> 41:06.020
that there's something
in there, for sure.

41:06.113 --> 41:09.190
- I love that.
- Yeah, me, too.

41:09.209 --> 41:11.375
- Well...
- MARTY: It was, it was a great adventure.

41:11.528 --> 41:13.118
Enrique, you were a great host.

41:13.138 --> 41:16.047
We're eager to come back,
so why don't you keep us posted?

41:16.199 --> 41:17.882
We'll kick around
when we might be able

41:18.034 --> 41:19.142
to do some more with you.

41:19.369 --> 41:20.310
- Thank you, my friend.
- RICK: Thank you.

41:20.537 --> 41:21.436
- Thanks.
- MARTY: We'll stay in touch.

41:23.389 --> 41:24.964
He's a great guy.

41:24.983 --> 41:26.724
The whole thing
was w-wonderful, um...

41:26.876 --> 41:29.877
I mean, Marty, what's your gut?

41:29.896 --> 41:32.380
I mean, we literally got dirty
in that backyard.

41:32.398 --> 41:34.473
- Is there more to do?
- Here's the thing about that.

41:34.567 --> 41:37.327
It's not that big a spot. I-I--
I mean, I think he's right,

41:37.478 --> 41:39.887
I-I think,
just-just what Rick said.

41:39.906 --> 41:41.313
Dig the whole back--
The backyard, Rick.

41:41.333 --> 41:42.724
I mean, you could--
He could do it with a shovel.

41:42.742 --> 41:43.983
- Yeah. Yeah.
- (laughs)

41:44.002 --> 41:45.168
- That small?
- MARTY: It's not that big.

41:45.395 --> 41:47.152
That yard couldn't
have been 30 by...

41:47.172 --> 41:48.746
- 50, maybe?
- Yeah.

41:48.898 --> 41:50.581
- So it's doable.
- MARTY: Yes.

41:50.734 --> 41:52.400
You would love El Paso.

41:52.418 --> 41:54.677
I mean, you love the whole
conquistador thing.

41:54.829 --> 41:56.513
Well, I-I'm a little bit jealous
right now.

41:56.664 --> 41:58.497
It's hot weather
and you got dirty.

41:58.517 --> 41:59.924
(laughs)

42:00.018 --> 42:01.834
Having said that, Rick,
let's us not give up

42:01.928 --> 42:02.927
on our own treasure hunt.

42:03.021 --> 42:04.854
RICK:
I agree.

42:05.081 --> 42:06.414
Awesome.

42:06.432 --> 42:08.249
Marty, we made
new amigos and amigas

42:08.268 --> 42:09.859
down south on the border.

42:10.011 --> 42:12.195
MARTY:
On the border, at the pass.

42:12.346 --> 42:13.755
I'll meet you
at the pass, Matty.

42:13.848 --> 42:14.864
MATTY (laughs):
Yes, sir.
