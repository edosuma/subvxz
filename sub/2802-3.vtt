00:10.135 --> 00:12.471
-How you doing today, sir?
-Very well, thanks.

00:12.554 --> 00:13.597
Thank you.

00:17.226 --> 00:19.728
PETER: I hope you're not
admiring your own work.

00:19.811 --> 00:22.773
I wish I was.
But I got a pretty good alibi.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.149
I was working with you yesterday.

00:24.233 --> 00:27.402
I'll be sure to back you up
when we talk to the Lamson Gallery.

00:27.486 --> 00:30.489
-Curator is waiting for us upstairs.
-I love a good art heist.

00:30.572 --> 00:33.492
-Solving a good art heist.
-That's what I said.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.869
Let me see that.

00:35.953 --> 00:38.622
Lewis Thayer's <i>Untitled Number Two.</i>

00:38.705 --> 00:40.874
It's worth $4 million.

00:40.958 --> 00:42.417
You'd think for that kind of money

00:42.501 --> 00:43.919
he'd have bothered
to come up with a title.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.129
Well, it is one of his seminal pieces.

00:46.213 --> 00:49.132
Is it a fad or talent
that drives up the price?

00:49.216 --> 00:50.551
Both. Neither.

00:50.634 --> 00:53.512
Don't try to understand
the peculiarities of the pop art market.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.514
Would you pay $4 million for that?

00:55.597 --> 00:56.849
Pay?

00:56.932 --> 00:59.476
Yeah. You're the wrong guy to ask.

00:59.560 --> 01:03.230
PETER: Miss Jeffries.
Special Agent Burke. This is Neal Caffrey.

01:03.313 --> 01:04.898
-How you doing?
-Tell us what happened.

01:04.982 --> 01:07.317
Well, as you can see,
the <i>Untitled Number Two</i>

01:07.401 --> 01:09.111
was simply cut out of its frame.

01:09.194 --> 01:13.198
How does someone pull a down and dirty
slash and grab from a major gallery?

01:13.282 --> 01:15.951
That's one of the few options left if you
want to knock over a high-security...

01:16.034 --> 01:18.370
-I was talking to her.
-Mr. Caffrey's right.

01:18.453 --> 01:21.957
We have sensors in the frame,
but nothing attached to the canvas.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.917
Cutting it out of the frame
circumvents the alarm.

01:24.001 --> 01:26.378
Got it. Security cameras?

01:26.461 --> 01:29.256
The theft occurred
during our daily security tape swap.

01:29.339 --> 01:31.800
So we're not dealing
with complete amateurs.

01:31.884 --> 01:33.635
No, actually,
it sounds like a pretty good plan.

01:33.719 --> 01:36.972
What are the odds
you'll be able to recover the painting?

01:37.055 --> 01:40.726
Well, it would've made my job a lot easier
if you had kept it from the press.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.644
-We did.
-Somebody didn't.

01:48.400 --> 01:51.195
-Anonymous tip.
-You think our thieves called it in?

01:51.278 --> 01:54.281
Good chance.
Headlines attract black market buyers.

01:54.364 --> 01:55.991
Which means they want to move
the painting quickly.

01:56.074 --> 01:58.869
-I can ask around.
-Good, run your street contacts.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.288
Diana, you've got Europe.
Check with Interpol.

02:01.371 --> 02:04.625
Jones, you're on Asia.
Check with the Alat over there.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.168
JONES: Yup.

02:10.631 --> 02:11.632
What?

02:11.715 --> 02:13.300
Do you mind?
I need to check my street contacts.

02:13.383 --> 02:15.511
-Calling Mozzie?
-He's good at this kind of thing.

02:15.594 --> 02:18.055
-You sure he didn't do it?
-Slash and grab.

02:19.765 --> 02:20.849
Frame's too high.

02:21.808 --> 02:22.851
Yeah.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.103

-I know.

02:31.318 --> 02:33.445

02:49.378 --> 02:52.005
What are you doing here?
I said meet me in an hour.

02:52.089 --> 02:55.133
You found a source in less than an hour.
That's pretty quick, Mozz.

02:55.217 --> 02:57.010
I only deal with professionals.

02:57.094 --> 02:59.805
And you asked about a reward,
which you never ask about.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.307
So I'm starting to think you're talking
to somebody else and not telling me.

03:02.391 --> 03:04.768
-You're paranoid.
-Who's your fence, Mozz?

03:04.852 --> 03:09.398
I am friends with many people
of unsavory character.

03:09.481 --> 03:12.150
Mmm-hmm.
How long have you been talking to her?

03:12.234 --> 03:14.111
I know not of who you speak.

03:16.196 --> 03:19.116
Sorry, meeting aborted.
My sources spook easily.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.743
They have to think I'm a vault.

03:21.827 --> 03:23.412

I saw a mockingbird in the park.

03:38.218 --> 03:41.221
-What color was the mockingbird?
-The bird died, let's go.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.473
NEAL: What are you doing here, Alex?

03:43.557 --> 03:46.602
I've never known you to go skulking around
after reward money.

03:46.685 --> 03:49.771
Well, after the plane blew up,
a lot of people were asking questions.

03:49.855 --> 03:52.649
I'm trying to stay off the radar.
Makes it hard to find work.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.360
-You came to Mozzie, not me?
-He's not tethered to the FBI.

03:55.444 --> 03:57.196
Two taps meant abort, by the way.

03:57.279 --> 03:58.989
Or you could've just yelled "abort."

03:59.072 --> 04:02.701
I found the missing Thayer painting.
It was fenced in Dubai.

04:02.784 --> 04:03.785
Thanks.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.664
But you didn't come just to say that.
What are you really doing here, Alex?

04:07.748 --> 04:10.542
I needed to talk to Mozzie. Alone.

04:11.335 --> 04:13.003
-What did I do?
-We'll talk.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.671
We're not friends anymore?

-On my way.

04:25.015 --> 04:26.391
(BEEP)

04:26.475 --> 04:29.102
Gotta go back to the office.
We'll talk later.

04:33.899 --> 04:36.693
-What are we talking about?
-I've got a big problem.

04:36.777 --> 04:37.861
Yeah.

04:42.699 --> 04:45.536
Great, great. Overnight it.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.120
I found the painting.

04:47.204 --> 04:48.872
-How'd you find it? I found it.
-Where?

04:48.956 --> 04:50.749
It was fenced
to a textile magnate in Dubai.

04:50.832 --> 04:53.252
A hotel heiress in Budapest
just turned hers in.

04:53.335 --> 04:55.462
-Good news.
-You found the painting overseas.

04:55.546 --> 04:58.298
-Scotland Yard has it.
-It's also in Dubai and Budapest.

04:58.382 --> 04:59.633
-What?
-NEAL: They're forgeries.

04:59.716 --> 05:00.926
All of them? How do you know?

05:01.009 --> 05:03.637
Because custom clamps down
when a theft occurs.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.056
The risk of getting the original out
are too high.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.766
But if you make forgeries ahead of time,

05:07.850 --> 05:10.102
and take them out of the country
before the heist, you're in the clear.

05:10.185 --> 05:12.771
Steal the Thayer, leak the theft
to the press, then sell the forgeries.

05:12.855 --> 05:14.731
And the original never leaves the country.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.024
You've seen this scam before.

05:16.108 --> 05:17.818
-I know someone who...
-Allegedly.

05:17.901 --> 05:19.945
...allegedly pulled it off before.

05:20.028 --> 05:23.156
-We have a copycat on our hands.
-Who are they copycatting?

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

05:44.303 --> 05:46.638

-Neal.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.036
Neal.

06:09.119 --> 06:11.121
I don't think our forger
went off a photograph.

06:11.205 --> 06:13.457
I think they stood in front
of the original when they painted these.

06:13.540 --> 06:14.666
How do you know that?

06:14.750 --> 06:16.835
Thayer used the Ben-Day dots method
to show shading.

06:16.919 --> 06:18.795
He spread paint across a paper stencil

06:18.879 --> 06:21.173
and pushed it against
the canvas with a brush.

06:21.256 --> 06:23.133
The shadowing in these paintings
is more deliberate.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.513
It's minute, but these dots
grow starker at the bottom.

06:27.596 --> 06:30.933
Forger probably started in afternoon light
when the color was slightly more red.

06:31.016 --> 06:32.726
He also didn't realize
they caught the painting

06:32.809 --> 06:36.230
when the light was directly down on it
causing a deeper contrast at the bottom.

06:36.313 --> 06:37.689
There's no lighting overhead.

06:37.773 --> 06:41.151
Was this painting
ever hanging below that skylight?

06:41.235 --> 06:44.363
Yes, in late April. We had a pop art show.

06:44.446 --> 06:46.823
We wanted to display
the Thayer prominently.

06:46.907 --> 06:50.035
Then we should check
the registration log for April.

06:50.118 --> 06:51.370
Probably looking for a student.

06:51.453 --> 06:53.455
Talented, but still
experimenting with technique.

06:53.539 --> 06:56.542
Someone like Justin Magary
from Eastside University.

06:56.625 --> 06:59.670
He stopped by
on the 21st of April at 1:45.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.255
That would be afternoon light.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.638
What's that on your face?

07:09.721 --> 07:11.473
I haven't seen you this happy in awhile.

07:11.557 --> 07:13.475
You know, it's a beautiful day.

07:13.559 --> 07:15.394
PETER: You're excited
someone's copycatting you.

07:15.477 --> 07:17.771
Imitation, flattery,
you know what they say.

07:17.855 --> 07:19.481
Mmm-hmm.

07:19.565 --> 07:21.900
-You ever been on a campus?
-Not as a student.

07:21.984 --> 07:24.570
And yet you have three MBAs
and two doctorates.

07:24.653 --> 07:26.071
Clearly something wrong with the system.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.781
PETER: Too bad you faked it.

07:27.865 --> 07:30.784
They could've made copies of you
and filled up a frat house.

07:30.868 --> 07:33.078
Oh, are we bitter
we weren't invited to the party?

07:33.161 --> 07:36.832
Oh, it's just with my father's
construction salary

07:36.915 --> 07:38.625
I had to stick to the grindstone.

07:38.709 --> 07:42.087
Four years of advanced math on scholarship
and then two years of accounting.

07:42.171 --> 07:44.965
I still can't imagine you
hunched over a desk

07:45.048 --> 07:46.842
with a little visor doing my taxes.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.802
You're lucky the FBI hires mathletes.

07:48.886 --> 07:52.055
I was not a mathlete.
I was an athlete who was good at math.

07:52.139 --> 07:55.601
Yeah. We fraternity guys call you "nerds."

07:55.684 --> 07:58.478
So why'd you forego school
and go to New York?

07:58.562 --> 08:01.106
Sorry, we're here to interrogate
someone else.

08:08.322 --> 08:09.990
PETER: See what you missed out on?

08:10.616 --> 08:12.910
I'm reconsidering my position on college.

08:58.789 --> 09:00.791
Uh, nothing.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.835
I mean... I mean, I know it of course.

09:02.918 --> 09:05.295
-You ever painted one?
-That's a good question.

09:05.379 --> 09:06.922
I probably shouldn't say anything.

09:07.005 --> 09:10.717
We've got you on a camera sketching it
at the Lamson Gallery in April.

09:11.593 --> 09:13.220
That's legal, right?

09:13.303 --> 09:16.515
Not when three of your copies
are fenced as the real thing.

09:16.598 --> 09:20.018
That turns them into forgeries.
Which is illegal.

09:20.102 --> 09:21.520
I can vouch for that.

09:21.603 --> 09:23.689
It's looking pretty bad for you, kid.

09:23.772 --> 09:25.774
If you talk to me, I can help you.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.194
JUSTIN: A while ago, I answered an ad

09:29.278 --> 09:31.363
in the school's list server
for reproductions.

09:31.446 --> 09:33.490
I get an e-mail back
commissioning seven copies

09:33.574 --> 09:35.075
-of <i>Untitled Number Two.</i>
-Seven?

09:35.158 --> 09:37.536
Did you wonder why somebody
would want seven copies?

09:37.619 --> 09:40.080
You know how hard it is to make money
as an art student doing art?

09:40.163 --> 09:42.207
-PETER: Who hired you?
-I didn't meet them.

09:42.291 --> 09:44.084
They dropped the materials off
in my mailbox.

09:44.168 --> 09:46.044
And once I'd finished,
they said to leave the paintings

09:46.128 --> 09:48.338
in the rec center and the money
would be left in my box again.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.632
I thought it was weird
they didn't want to meet, so...

09:50.716 --> 09:52.551
So you stayed and watched the pickup?

09:53.510 --> 09:57.472
Yeah. I wanted to make sure it was legit.
And she seemed normal, so I let it go.

09:57.556 --> 09:59.349
All right, if you sat down
with a sketch artist,

09:59.433 --> 10:01.435
do you think you could remember
what she looked like?

10:01.518 --> 10:03.020
-May I?
-PETER: Yeah.

10:09.401 --> 10:10.611
This is her.

10:15.741 --> 10:17.492
ALEX: My fault? It's your fault.

10:17.576 --> 10:20.037
This would've never happened
if you kept a lower profile.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.330
This is why I work in code.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.041
-Anything I can do?
-I don't need your help.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.626
-She needs your help.
-Alex.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.503
-Someone's looking for her.
-NEAL: Who?

10:27.586 --> 10:29.338
She thinks it has something to do
with the music box.

10:29.421 --> 10:30.547
-Why?
-Well, she thinks...

10:30.631 --> 10:31.965
Let her talk.

10:32.049 --> 10:34.927
I don't know who,
but they've got a powerful reach

10:35.010 --> 10:36.470
and they've turned over a lot of stones.

10:36.553 --> 10:37.679
All right, what can I do?

10:44.394 --> 10:46.939
-Krugerrands?
-I needed the money to disappear.

10:47.022 --> 10:49.608
I hooked her up with someone
who deals in Krugerrands.

10:49.691 --> 10:52.027
-I've been fencing some in increments.
-Who's the guy?

10:52.778 --> 10:55.489
Russell Smith. Old friend from Detroit.

10:55.572 --> 10:58.033
Some friend.
Russell found out someone's looking for me

10:58.116 --> 10:59.743
and now he's gonna sell me out.

10:59.826 --> 11:02.329
I need you to shut him up.

11:02.412 --> 11:05.374
Short of killing him, I'm open to ideas.

11:05.457 --> 11:07.000
-Ugh!
-All right.

11:07.084 --> 11:09.503
Give me some time.
I'll figure something out.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.090
You know I won't let
anything happen to you.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.342
(SIGHS)

11:17.803 --> 11:18.887
Thanks.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.019
She comes to you and not to me?

11:26.103 --> 11:28.939
Well, far be it for me
to act as therapist,

11:30.774 --> 11:34.486
but maybe Alex doesn't want to see
you heartbroken over Kate.

11:36.488 --> 11:39.366
-Or maybe it's the tracking anklet.
-Sure, the anklet.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.039
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

11:46.123 --> 11:47.666
Found our girl.

11:47.749 --> 11:48.959
Justin's got talent.

11:49.042 --> 11:52.004
If ever we're short a sketch artist,
I know who to call.

11:52.087 --> 11:54.339
-Who is she?
-Veronica Naylon.

11:54.423 --> 11:56.258
-Did she send the e-mail?
-Can't be sure.

11:56.341 --> 11:58.260
The account's defunct
and the address was generic.

11:58.343 --> 12:01.013
Both the ad and e-mail account
were created at the school computer lab,

12:01.096 --> 12:02.389
so anyone could've done it.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.016
Here's her workup.

12:06.018 --> 12:08.687
Junior. Majoring in Archeology.

12:08.770 --> 12:11.565
Mediocre grades. No priors.

12:11.648 --> 12:15.277
How does an average 21-year-old student
from the Upper East Side pull this off?

12:15.360 --> 12:16.695
You think she has accomplices.

12:16.778 --> 12:18.697
Maybe this is where she met them.

12:18.780 --> 12:20.324
She's an Archeology major,

12:20.407 --> 12:23.160
but she's currently acing
a criminology class.

12:23.243 --> 12:26.079
-The one class she's pulling an A.
-How appropriate.

12:26.163 --> 12:29.541
Oh, if you like that, you'll love this.
Syllabus for the class.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.337
Oh.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.756
He's gonna be impossible after this.

12:35.839 --> 12:37.466
Where's Neal?

12:44.056 --> 12:45.432
Oh, look at you.

12:45.516 --> 12:48.977
You'd think being copycatted
was like winning the crime Oscar.

12:49.061 --> 12:50.395
What, I'm not allowed to revel?

12:50.479 --> 12:52.940
All right, take me through
your version of this scam.

12:53.023 --> 12:54.191
How many players are involved?

12:54.274 --> 12:57.194
Well, you need a forger, a thief,
and a couple fences.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.112
Not the kind of thing
you'd pull off by yourself.

12:59.196 --> 13:01.281
Not unless you can be
in multiple places at once.

13:01.365 --> 13:03.033
I mean, it's a sophisticated job.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.369
I doubt Justin or our mystery girl
thought of it themselves.

13:05.452 --> 13:08.288
No, but they might have
figured it out by studying you.

13:08.372 --> 13:12.835
Our mystery girl, Veronica,
she's acing a criminology class.

13:12.918 --> 13:14.127
Here's the syllabus.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.550
-They spent a week on me?
-Apparently,

13:19.633 --> 13:22.010
you're one of the interesting criminals
of the 21st century.

13:22.094 --> 13:26.056
"A new breed of forger,
technological virtuoso." Wow.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.642
"With a classical artistic foundation."
They got it.

13:28.725 --> 13:29.977
Yeah, yeah. I read it.

13:30.060 --> 13:31.478
Oh. They covered the Antioch manuscripts.

13:31.562 --> 13:33.188
-Did you see that?
-I know, relax.

13:33.272 --> 13:34.648
They only covered you for a week.

13:34.731 --> 13:37.109
By the end of the year,
they probably won't remember your name.

13:37.192 --> 13:38.861
Well, obviously a few of them will.

13:40.362 --> 13:42.364
You think she formed a crew in this class?

13:42.447 --> 13:44.575
People have been known
to fall for a pretty face.

13:46.076 --> 13:48.579
If Veronica had help,

13:48.662 --> 13:52.124
I don't want to scare them away
by my talking to her just yet.

13:52.207 --> 13:54.334
-Well, I could talk to her.
-Now you're reading my mind.

13:54.418 --> 13:56.920
-Anklet?
-I'll pull it for this one.

13:57.004 --> 13:59.965
-You ready to go back to school?
-I think I can handle that.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.593
Because I'm a technological virtuoso.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.178
Okay.

14:04.261 --> 14:06.138
With a classical artistic foundation.

14:06.221 --> 14:09.349
Yes, okay.
Okay, read it to yourself. Quiet now.

14:09.433 --> 14:12.561
-Did you guys see this syllabus?
-PETER: No, we don't need to share.

14:12.644 --> 14:14.438
-NEAL: I'm in it.
-Yup. Go, team.

14:18.150 --> 14:22.487
The Koechert Diamond Pearl
was stolen by Gerald Blanchard in 1998.

14:22.571 --> 14:26.283
It took them a full two weeks
to realize that the jewel was missing,

14:26.366 --> 14:31.371
because Blanchard replaced it
with a pretty darn good costume replica.

14:31.455 --> 14:35.334
He circumvented the alarms
at the Viennese castle

14:35.417 --> 14:38.670
by parachuting onto the roof,
if you can believe it or not.

14:38.754 --> 14:41.131
Some people have called this
the perfect crime.

14:41.215 --> 14:42.925
NEAL: I wouldn't say he was perfect.

14:44.259 --> 14:46.011
And Blanchard overshot his landing.

14:46.094 --> 14:47.804
He, uh, slipped on the tiles,

14:47.888 --> 14:50.516
but saved himself by grabbing
a railing on the castle's roof.

14:50.599 --> 14:52.184
So I'd say he loses marks for style.

14:52.267 --> 14:58.315
Excuse me. I believe
we have a celebrity in our midst.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.193
-WOMAN: Who?
-This is Mr. Neal Caffrey.

15:01.276 --> 15:02.903
To what do we owe the honor, sir?

15:02.986 --> 15:05.781
I understand you study the best criminals.

15:05.864 --> 15:07.324
And I share that interest.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.034

15:09.117 --> 15:10.911
-OSWALD: Wow.
-You.

15:11.787 --> 15:13.413
You seem like a very capable teacher.

15:13.497 --> 15:15.707
Oh, please.

15:15.791 --> 15:17.709
You know, you would be a far better...

15:17.793 --> 15:19.044
Hey, why don't you...

15:19.127 --> 15:21.338
Could you come up here
and answer some ques...

15:21.421 --> 15:22.589
-NEAL: No.
-Class, wouldn't you love

15:22.673 --> 15:26.009
-to have Neal Caffrey up here teaching?
-NEAL: Really? Really?

15:26.093 --> 15:27.386
OSWALD: Come on.

15:29.513 --> 15:31.974
We would love to have
some of your expertise.

15:32.057 --> 15:33.684
-Pleasure to have you.
-Pleasure to be here.

15:33.767 --> 15:34.768
OSWALD: Please.

15:34.852 --> 15:37.354
All right.
Well, we'll stick to the hypotheticals.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.439
Anything covered
by the statute of limitations.

15:39.523 --> 15:41.024

-Who's first?

15:41.108 --> 15:42.484
Oh! Wow.

15:42.568 --> 15:44.319
-All right.
-(CHATTERING)

15:47.489 --> 15:48.532
How about you?

15:53.537 --> 15:56.999
No, in theory, the carrier pigeons
only delivered the vault combination.

15:57.082 --> 16:00.043
They didn't carry the manuscripts.
Next question.

16:03.964 --> 16:06.633
When executing a heist, Mr. Caffrey,

16:06.717 --> 16:08.677
do you prefer boxers or briefs?

16:08.760 --> 16:09.803
(LAUGHTER)

16:09.887 --> 16:11.972
I think some things
are better left to the imagination.

16:14.683 --> 16:17.269
There's not much written
about your arrest.

16:17.352 --> 16:18.395
How'd you get caught?

16:19.938 --> 16:21.648
Momentary lapse in concentration.

16:21.732 --> 16:23.609
So the FBI had nothing to do with it?

16:23.692 --> 16:25.694
Oh, they'd like to take credit for it.

16:25.777 --> 16:27.362
But essentially, I turned myself in.

16:28.614 --> 16:31.283
Recently, you were suspected
in the La Joyau diamond heist.

16:31.366 --> 16:33.410
Suspected and then cleared.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.163
I served my four years,
and I decided I didn't want to go back.

16:36.246 --> 16:38.498
Been living like all you ever since then.

16:38.582 --> 16:39.917
Or trying to.

16:40.792 --> 16:44.046
Okay. Let's thank Mr. Neal Caffrey.

-OSWALD: Thank you, class.

-Thank you so much, Mr. Caffrey.
-Oh, no.

16:59.269 --> 17:01.188
-Fascinating.
-It's the least I could do.

17:01.271 --> 17:04.066
You know, I thought I should participate
in my own copyright infringement.

17:04.149 --> 17:05.192
Excuse me?

17:07.819 --> 17:10.447
It's a little green to rip off
someone's con unless you improve it.

17:10.531 --> 17:12.366
You and your kids
could use a little tutoring.

17:12.449 --> 17:15.410
I'm sorry, I...
I don't know what you're talking about.

17:15.494 --> 17:16.537
The Thayer theft?

17:17.496 --> 17:19.706
Hey, don't get me wrong, man.
I'm flattered.

17:19.790 --> 17:21.458
But, uh,

17:21.542 --> 17:25.003
I'd like to be cut in, you know?
I did lay the groundwork.

17:25.087 --> 17:28.590
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but I'm a professor who teaches crime.

17:28.674 --> 17:30.342
I don't go out there and commit them.

17:31.301 --> 17:32.302
Okay.

17:34.263 --> 17:35.430
Mr. Caffrey?

17:36.598 --> 17:40.477
Um. I get together
with a group of students after class.

17:40.561 --> 17:43.272
-Yeah, you got some bright kids here.
-Yeah. There's a few of them.

17:43.355 --> 17:46.483
We go to a bar called
The Globe around the corner.

17:46.567 --> 17:48.110
Be thrilled if you would join us.

17:48.193 --> 17:49.820
-The Globe?
-Yeah.

17:49.903 --> 17:51.029
I'll think about that.

17:51.113 --> 17:53.115
I think you might find it interesting.

17:53.866 --> 17:55.492
-Have a great day.
-Thank you.

17:55.576 --> 17:56.827
And thanks again.

Suddenly, I don't feel bad
about telling you this.

18:10.048 --> 18:12.050
You're not the only person
they've been copying.

18:12.134 --> 18:15.846
-What?
-Seems those who can, also teach.

18:15.929 --> 18:19.600
We crosschecked all of the crimes
in Professor Oswald's syllabi

18:19.683 --> 18:21.393
since he started teaching ten years ago.

18:21.476 --> 18:23.812
We suspect he counterfeited
a bank note last year,

18:23.896 --> 18:26.440
forged an Emerson letter,
and smuggled Egyptian artifacts.

18:26.523 --> 18:27.774
He copied Tokley-Perry?

18:28.317 --> 18:30.444
Well, felony by proxy,
you gotta give him credit.

18:30.527 --> 18:33.197
(CHUCKLES) We also think
that he might've stolen

18:33.280 --> 18:34.865
Matisse's <i>View of Saint Tropez.</i>

18:34.948 --> 18:37.451
Matisse? That's a serious payday.

18:37.534 --> 18:39.786
PETER: Unfortunately,
this is all speculation.

18:39.870 --> 18:42.497
Oswald is taking advantage
of his students.

18:42.581 --> 18:46.835
And Justin is going to go down for this
unless we can prove it wasn't him.

18:46.919 --> 18:49.379
Well, we have one card left.
We know about the Thayer.

18:49.463 --> 18:50.797
Oswald's hiding it somewhere.

18:50.881 --> 18:52.466
He's not gonna give it up soon.

18:52.549 --> 18:55.886
Interpol found the fences
who sold the forgeries abroad.

18:55.969 --> 18:58.013
They know they're being watched.
They're out of play.

18:58.096 --> 18:59.806
So he'll need a local fence.

-Maybe.

-You're paying with hundreds, Manny.

He's gonna sell me out
to whoever put the price on my head,

23:35.499 --> 23:38.919

is to bring the feds into it?

23:39.002 --> 23:42.631
I tell the FBI that Oswald and his kids
are gonna steal the Krugerrands.

23:42.714 --> 23:45.342
They'll pull Russell in to talk.
It'll kill his reputation.

-Oswald can sell them out.

to steal them from him instead.

34:25.148 --> 34:28.193
You stole my Krugerrands
and I want them back.

34:28.277 --> 34:29.570
Kru... Kru...

34:31.864 --> 34:34.366
Listen, I don't have time for jokes.

34:34.449 --> 34:35.742
-Okay.
-(GUN CLICKS)

34:37.703 --> 34:41.123
When it's a matter
of our missing money, I never joke.

34:41.206 --> 34:42.291
I never joke.

34:46.628 --> 34:48.755
This picture tells a story, professor.

34:50.132 --> 34:52.176
OSWALD: I don't see myself in that story.

34:52.259 --> 34:53.802
No, but you see the case.

34:53.886 --> 34:55.721
And now you've got it.

34:56.638 --> 34:59.224
Tell him you'll cut off his hands
if he doesn't pay up.

34:59.308 --> 35:00.309
What?

35:00.392 --> 35:02.895
It's the Detroit mob, not the Girl Scouts.

35:04.313 --> 35:07.524
I wouldn't want anything
to happen to your hands, professor.

35:09.610 --> 35:12.613
-I said, cut off his hands.
-Quiet, Mozz.

35:12.696 --> 35:15.073
All right, listen, listen,
if you're the Peacemaker,

35:15.157 --> 35:17.951
I'm sure we can find some common ground.

35:18.035 --> 35:20.412
The Krugerrands were worth $2 million.

35:20.495 --> 35:22.623
I want three for my trouble.

35:22.706 --> 35:25.834
Well, well, that's simply not possible.

35:25.918 --> 35:27.085
Make it possible.

35:27.169 --> 35:29.838
PETER: <i>Deliver it tomorrow.</i>

35:29.922 --> 35:31.965
Or I'll start with your thumbs.

35:33.091 --> 35:35.844
Or I'll start with your thumbs.

35:47.648 --> 35:49.650
I can get you $200,000.

35:49.733 --> 35:51.360
-Two hundred?
-Ten percent.

35:51.443 --> 35:55.239
No, no, no, no.
Thirty percent is the going rate.

35:55.989 --> 35:57.449
Six hundred thousand, fine.

35:57.533 --> 36:00.118
Okay. I need that wired today.

36:00.702 --> 36:01.912
-Okay?
-No problem.

36:02.704 --> 36:04.122
How much can I get for this?

36:04.206 --> 36:06.041
Original Thayer, nice.

36:06.124 --> 36:07.501
I'll give you half a mil.

36:08.544 --> 36:10.003
(LAUGHS)

36:10.087 --> 36:13.048
Where does it say "dumb schmuck"
on my face?

36:13.131 --> 36:16.260
The painting's been sliced.
Take it or leave it.

36:16.343 --> 36:18.512
Listen. It's cut at the frame line.

36:18.595 --> 36:21.682
Re-stretched, you're not gonna
lose even an inch of canvas.

36:21.765 --> 36:24.852
You won't have any trouble
finding an enthusiastic buyer

36:24.935 --> 36:26.645
-in Macao or Singapore.
-(CHUCKLES)

36:26.728 --> 36:29.940
And I think you know that.

36:30.023 --> 36:32.651
-Oh. The professor's done his homework.
-Yes.

36:32.734 --> 36:35.237
-Okay, $2 million.
-Wired today.

36:36.321 --> 36:37.322
Got it.

36:39.116 --> 36:41.785
I'll need your account and routing number.

36:43.161 --> 36:45.622
-Testing me, were you?
-Mmm.

36:49.877 --> 36:51.170
There you go.

36:53.005 --> 36:55.382
It's a pleasure doing business, George.

36:55.465 --> 36:58.051
-I wish I could say that it...
-FBI!

36:58.135 --> 37:00.762
Don't move, hands on the table.
Hands on the table.

37:02.556 --> 37:04.433
George Oswald, you're under arrest.

37:05.225 --> 37:06.351
OSWALD: No.

37:07.311 --> 37:08.520
No.

37:09.605 --> 37:11.023
Good to see you again, professor.

37:11.607 --> 37:12.941
Careful with his hands.

37:13.025 --> 37:14.234
OSWALD: I want to see my lawyer.

37:14.318 --> 37:15.819
JONES: Come on, get moving.

37:17.070 --> 37:19.114
Thank you, Miss Hunter.

37:19.198 --> 37:23.118
And I believe
you've been looking for this.

37:24.745 --> 37:29.041
Uh, per Neal's suggestion,
we booked you on a secure flight to Italy.

37:29.124 --> 37:32.419
And we made sure
we publicly thanked Russell,

37:32.503 --> 37:36.465
for his thoughtful
and continued cooperation with the FBI.

37:38.425 --> 37:39.843
Neal said you were the best.

38:02.157 --> 38:03.242
Hello, everyone.

38:03.325 --> 38:06.495
Your professor, George Oswald,
will not be joining you today.

38:06.578 --> 38:11.166
Instead, I'm here
as a recruiter for the FBI.

38:11.250 --> 38:13.710
Hi, I'm Special Agent Peter Burke.

38:13.794 --> 38:16.755
And these are some of my colleagues.

38:16.839 --> 38:18.674
They studied criminology just like you,

38:18.757 --> 38:21.927
and now they get to catch
bad guys for a living.

38:22.010 --> 38:24.680
-FBI, you're under arrest.
-You're under arrest.

38:24.763 --> 38:25.889
Guys, stay calm.

38:25.973 --> 38:27.474
Professor Oswald, he made us do it.

38:27.558 --> 38:29.893
-Good job, Manny, way to stay calm.
-MANNY: Veronica, let me handle this.

38:29.977 --> 38:31.520
Listen to me, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

38:31.603 --> 38:32.604
You don't understand.

38:32.688 --> 38:34.189
PETER: If you think it's fun
reading about these guys,

38:34.273 --> 38:36.483
wait until you experience
the feeling of catching them.

38:36.567 --> 38:39.361
MANNY: He was gonna grade us badly.
We didn't know what to do.

38:39.444 --> 38:42.489
For the record, I still maintain
that I basically turned myself in.

38:42.573 --> 38:45.158
The full weight of the FBI
was bearing down on you.

38:46.618 --> 38:47.953
I wear a badge.

38:48.829 --> 38:50.122
He wears a tracking anklet.

-ERIC: Shut your mouth.
-I got this.

39:01.717 --> 39:03.927
There's a lot of information
that we have for you.

39:04.011 --> 39:05.679
ERIC: Manny, shut the hell up.
PETER: DA's dream.

39:05.762 --> 39:07.347
Tripping over themselves to cut a deal.

39:07.431 --> 39:09.433
They're young.
We'll probably give it to them.

39:27.534 --> 39:28.994
<i>I have something to show you.</i>

39:35.542 --> 39:37.878
At first, I thought
one of the cherubs had broken off.

40:16.625 --> 40:18.544
-Hmm.
-Oh, you... You know what?

40:18.627 --> 40:19.878
I'm gonna actually keep that

40:19.962 --> 40:21.463
-up here with me.
-Yeah.

40:24.341 --> 40:26.343
You know, it's interesting.

40:26.426 --> 40:27.845
We searched Oswald's house

40:27.928 --> 40:30.556
and found several of the things
he was suspected of stealing.

40:30.639 --> 40:32.850
Jewelry, Egyptian artifacts.

40:33.559 --> 40:34.768
But there was a Matisse.

40:36.770 --> 40:38.772
-Matisse? Hmm.
-Mmm-hmm.

40:38.856 --> 40:41.191
It was rumored Oswald had it,
but it wasn't at his house.

40:41.275 --> 40:43.986
That's a shame. Be worth a fortune.

40:44.069 --> 40:46.613
Yes, it would.
It's about the size of your box there.

40:48.031 --> 40:51.577
I'll keep an eye out.
I could use the reward money.

-Could we get it into X-ray?
