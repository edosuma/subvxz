00:17.809 --> 00:21.438
- * Well,
sometimes I go out by myself *

00:21.479 --> 00:25.483
* And I look across the water *

00:25.525 --> 00:27.068
Whoo-hoo!
- Scheisse!

00:27.110 --> 00:30.196
- * And I think of all the
things, what you're doing *

00:30.238 --> 00:34.159
* And in my head,
I'll paint a picture *

00:34.200 --> 00:35.535
- Hey--ugh.

00:35.577 --> 00:38.204
- * Oh, since
I've come on home *

00:38.246 --> 00:40.582
* Well, my body's been a mess *

00:40.623 --> 00:45.879
* And I miss your ginger hair
and the way you like to dress *

00:45.920 --> 00:47.672
* Won't you come on over? *

00:47.714 --> 00:52.302
* Stop making a fool
out of me *

00:52.344 --> 00:56.056
* Why don't you come on over,
Heidi? *

[notification chimes]

01:18.119 --> 01:19.996
- * Ba ba ba ba ba *

01:20.038 --> 01:22.082
- Snap out of it, Bumper!

01:22.123 --> 01:25.669
- I shower before bed so I'm
always clean when I get in it.

01:25.710 --> 01:27.504
Therefore,
my sheets are always clean

01:27.545 --> 01:29.589
because the body
in them is clean.

01:29.631 --> 01:33.051
So by transitive property,
I never have to wash my sheets.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.678
- Ah.
- I do not shower.

01:34.719 --> 01:37.138
I trust my sexual partners
to lick me clean.

01:37.180 --> 01:40.141
- Gross.
- That's a lot of trust.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.351
- Hello!

01:41.393 --> 01:44.396
A very equal hello
to all of you.

01:44.437 --> 01:47.607
Individually, I am greeting
you all individually,

01:47.649 --> 01:49.150
and no one more than the other.

01:52.153 --> 01:53.488
Hello, Hodie.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.365
I didn't realize you were
going to be here today.

01:55.407 --> 01:56.616
- Uh, you didn't--

01:56.658 --> 01:59.202
did you just call me Hodie?
- Did I?

01:59.244 --> 02:01.329
- Yeah.
- You know what I think it is?

02:01.371 --> 02:03.248
It's 'cause I think
about you so infrequently,

02:03.289 --> 02:05.333
it wasn't, like,
on the tip of my tongue.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.793
I sometimes forget it.
It's not Hodie?

02:06.835 --> 02:09.129
- It's Heidi.
- OK, now it's back.

02:09.170 --> 02:10.547
- Why wouldn't Heidi be here?

02:10.588 --> 02:12.465
- Yeah, they were all
on the text thread.

02:12.507 --> 02:13.842
- OK, why are we hashing
this out right now?

02:13.883 --> 02:16.302
Let's just get down to business
'cause I, for one,

02:16.344 --> 02:18.930
am here
for a business meeting, so...

02:18.972 --> 02:21.307
- Well. [clears throat]
I called you here

02:21.349 --> 02:22.726
to discuss our strategy

02:22.767 --> 02:25.103
for the Unity Day
auditions tomorrow.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.605
[echoing]
First things first...

02:27.647 --> 02:30.734
- Heidi, you have
a little eyelash.

02:30.775 --> 02:31.568
- Oh, I do?

02:31.609 --> 02:33.153
- Do you mind if I get it?

02:33.194 --> 02:36.531
- Yeah, sure, OK.

02:36.573 --> 02:39.034
- Actually, no,
it's just a shadow cast

02:39.075 --> 02:40.118
on your perfectly symmetrical--

02:40.160 --> 02:41.161
- Bumper!
- Hmm?

02:41.202 --> 02:42.662
- Focus up!
- Yep.

02:42.704 --> 02:43.788
- We've been preparing
for this day for months now.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.832
- Work mode. Focus up!

02:45.874 --> 02:47.417
Getting focused.

02:47.459 --> 02:50.211
You know what, I need
to feng shui this place

02:50.253 --> 02:51.338
real quick.
- What?

02:51.379 --> 02:52.797
- For me it's like
an energy thing

02:52.839 --> 02:53.965
in here right now, if you guys
could just switch places?

02:54.007 --> 02:55.258
- OK.
- Yeah.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.676
You go over there. Thank you.
- Sit here?

02:56.718 --> 02:58.178
- Sit right where you're at.
- Don't move Sebastian.

02:58.219 --> 02:59.763
- To me, this works better.

02:59.804 --> 03:01.264
That's a really good spot,
right there.

03:01.306 --> 03:02.265
Carry on.

03:02.307 --> 03:04.225
- OK.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.560
Yeah?
- Yep.

03:06.978 --> 03:12.567
- Let's go over our likely
panel of judges one more time.

03:12.609 --> 03:14.194
Our toughest judge will be--

03:14.235 --> 03:15.362
- OK, I know this one.

03:15.403 --> 03:18.990
Um, uh, not my feet,
but my Hans.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.909
- Yes, Hans Schroeder.

03:20.950 --> 03:22.619
His incisive critique
is so sharp,

03:22.660 --> 03:25.038
they call him
Edward Scissor-Hans.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.331
- Scissor-Hans, that's funny.

03:26.373 --> 03:29.417
- [gasps] Bumper!

03:29.459 --> 03:31.127
Yogurt?
- That's not mine.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.671
- Nein!

03:32.712 --> 03:33.963
- Ow!
- It wasn't mine.

03:34.005 --> 03:35.757
- For the next 24 hours,
I don't want your throat

03:35.799 --> 03:38.176
anywhere near dairy.
Understood?

03:38.218 --> 03:39.594
- I have to be totally honest.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.097
I eat an ice cream sundae
every morning for breakfast.

03:42.138 --> 03:43.264
- What?
- You know what?

03:43.306 --> 03:44.683
I'll downgrade
to a bowl of sprinkles

03:44.724 --> 03:46.101
if it'll help me
perform better.

03:46.142 --> 03:48.645
- It will, and thank you.
- You have got this, Bumper.

03:48.687 --> 03:50.355
We've been doing
everything right.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.815
Your songs are popular.

03:51.856 --> 03:53.650
That scrappy little video
that we made--

03:53.692 --> 03:55.902
without Klaus's help,
thank you very much--

03:55.944 --> 03:56.986
it's a hit, booboo.

03:57.028 --> 03:58.405
You've got this.
You've got real fans.

03:58.446 --> 03:59.989
- [giggles]
- And besides...

04:00.031 --> 04:00.990
- She called me booboo.

04:01.032 --> 04:02.409
- Other than Gisela,

04:02.450 --> 04:05.578
this is basically
your newcomer competition--

04:05.620 --> 04:07.706
the Oppenheimer Family Band.

04:07.747 --> 04:10.083
- Ugh, I hate family bands.

04:10.125 --> 04:13.336
It's cheating to start a band
with the people you invented.

04:13.378 --> 04:14.921
- Also, they're stupid.
- Ugh.

04:14.963 --> 04:16.339
- You've got
a great shot tomorrow, Bumper.

04:16.381 --> 04:18.591
All you need to do is focus up.

04:18.633 --> 04:21.094
- Yeah, no, totally ficus up.

04:21.136 --> 04:23.346
[dreamy music]

04:26.558 --> 04:27.934
- What the [bleep]
are you doing?

04:27.976 --> 04:28.852
- Hmm?

04:28.893 --> 04:33.648
- * Bow bow bow bow bow *

04:33.690 --> 04:36.192
* Bum bum bum *

04:36.234 --> 04:38.737
* Bum bum bum *

04:41.614 --> 04:43.450
- I cannot believe
you brought us here, Pieter.

04:43.491 --> 04:45.660
This is the best
restaurant in Berlin.

04:45.702 --> 04:48.705
- This is Bumper's last meal
before he's a superstar.

04:48.747 --> 04:50.749
Food will taste different
to him after tomorrow.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.835
- Ooh, isn't that
not my feet, but my Hans?

04:53.877 --> 04:54.919
- Yep.

04:54.961 --> 04:58.256
- Oh, yeah,
that is Hans Schroeder,

04:58.298 --> 05:00.550
the Unity Day judge.
Wow.

05:00.592 --> 05:03.011
How strange that he is
at his favorite restaurant

05:03.053 --> 05:04.971
on his anniversary,
which I discovered

05:05.013 --> 05:07.223
by poring
over marriage announcements

05:07.265 --> 05:09.768
on newspaper microfiche.
What?

05:09.809 --> 05:12.854
- You devious little minx
of a manager.

05:12.896 --> 05:15.774
This was your plan
all along, wasn't it?

05:15.815 --> 05:17.108
Sorry, I'm not good at winking.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.527
- OK, I'm going to go put
in a good word for you.

05:19.569 --> 05:20.945
You sit tight.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.906
I'll hit you with a signal
if he wants to meet.

05:25.116 --> 05:26.368
[clears throat]

05:27.827 --> 05:29.662
- What--what's the signal?

05:29.704 --> 05:31.331
We'll figure it out.

05:31.373 --> 05:32.791
- Hans, hello.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.876
Welcome to me, Pieter Kramer.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.503
And please say
hello and welcome

05:36.544 --> 05:38.254
to Bumper Allen over there.

05:38.296 --> 05:39.756
- Hi, Hans!

05:39.798 --> 05:43.009
- Yes, you will be hearing him
with your ears tomorrow.

05:43.051 --> 05:45.261
- Ah, yes.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.472
I'm seeing Bumper Allen
at last.

05:48.973 --> 05:50.016
- What do you think?

05:50.058 --> 05:51.393
Why don't we just
skip those auditions

05:51.434 --> 05:53.353
and just get
this guy booked, right?

05:53.395 --> 05:54.479
I'm kidding, of course.

05:54.521 --> 05:55.772
Unless that is possible?

05:55.814 --> 05:58.316
- This is the artist
formally known as Prawns.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.318
[all laughing]
Like Prince.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.736
- The judging committee feels--

06:01.778 --> 06:03.697
[glass shatters]
- Oh, son of a--God dang it!

06:03.738 --> 06:05.740
All right, we'll just--
will these sop it up?

06:05.782 --> 06:07.158
It's not sopping it.
- I don't know.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.451
- Miss, hi.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.286
Can I get a T-shirt
from the gift shop?

06:10.328 --> 06:12.205
- No.
- Interesting.

06:12.247 --> 06:13.707
Cracker Barrel has a gift shop.

06:13.748 --> 06:16.084
- The judging committee
feels Bumper

06:16.126 --> 06:19.170
is not the best representative
of what Germany has to offer.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.297
Then there's you, Pieter.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.299
Your name is still too toxic.

06:23.341 --> 06:25.343
Your personal failings--

06:25.385 --> 06:28.972
how do I say this
in a kind way?

06:29.014 --> 06:31.057
You make our genitals
shrivel up with rage

06:31.099 --> 06:32.142
at your music crimes.

06:32.183 --> 06:33.727
- But I'll just be
behind the scenes.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.353
You won't even know I'm there.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.022
I can duck in
the crowd if that helps?

06:37.063 --> 06:39.774
- I'm sorry, but we just
can't be involved in all that.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.943
Bumper is not going
to get an audition.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.908
- It's all over.
This was my last chance.

06:48.950 --> 06:51.578
- I'm sure there's something
else, some other concert.

06:51.619 --> 06:52.996
- That makes no difference.

06:53.038 --> 06:55.582
Try as I might, I clearly
will never outrun my shame.

06:55.623 --> 06:57.417
- OK, guys, I think we need

06:57.459 --> 06:59.085
to take a chillaxative,
all right?

06:59.127 --> 07:01.588
I will catch up to Hans and
smooth this whole thing out.

07:01.629 --> 07:04.257
- You just don't know
when to stop, do you?

07:04.299 --> 07:07.302
I was trying to help you make
a good impression with Hans,

07:07.344 --> 07:08.928
but you just made
us all look bad.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.433
- You're blaming me?
- Yeah.

07:13.475 --> 07:16.644
You're like a bumper car,
just bouncing and crashing

07:16.686 --> 07:18.772
into everyone
without a care in the world,

07:18.813 --> 07:20.690
treating Germany like
your private playground,

07:20.732 --> 07:22.359
which, by the way,
is a public playground

07:22.400 --> 07:24.652
because Germany is a wonderful
place to raise a family.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.154
- Oh, yeah? Well, we would
have still been in there

07:26.196 --> 07:28.740
eating fancy seafoam
if you hadn't turned

07:28.782 --> 07:30.867
the whole industry against us
with your cheating!

07:30.909 --> 07:33.119
- Oh, hey, hey, hey,
hey, come on now, OK?

07:33.161 --> 07:35.747
So no Unity Day. So what?

07:35.789 --> 07:37.290
We'll just keep working
on Bumper's career

07:37.332 --> 07:38.625
like we have been.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.543
Easy-peasy.
We can figure this out.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.629
- No, we won't, Heidi.

07:42.671 --> 07:45.965
Not every problem can be solved
by being perky and optimistic.

07:46.007 --> 07:47.425
- Yes, they can.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.553
- Oh, I am so tired of humoring
you two all the time!

07:50.595 --> 07:51.638
- Pieter, hold on.

07:51.680 --> 07:52.722
- Is that
what you have been doing

07:52.764 --> 07:54.849
all of these years,
humoring me?

07:54.891 --> 07:57.560
Is managing me some sort
of pity thing for you?

07:57.602 --> 07:58.645
- Well, it definitely
wasn't because

07:58.687 --> 08:00.146
of the money I was making.

08:00.188 --> 08:02.732
Oh, God, I'm better off
moving to the country

08:02.774 --> 08:05.819
and cutting off sheep testicles
like my ancestors.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.195
I resign as a manager.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.780
- What?
- Fine!

08:08.822 --> 08:11.074
Then I pre-emptively
fire you as my manager.

08:11.116 --> 08:12.742
- Thea, are you going
to say anything?

08:12.784 --> 08:13.952
- I'm staying out of this.

08:13.993 --> 08:15.829
I don't care.
- Oh, of course you don't.

08:15.870 --> 08:16.913
- You never care
about anything.

08:16.955 --> 08:19.249
- Let's just hash
this out real quick.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.626
- I'm sorry, Bumper.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.670
But everyone's just
out for themselves.

08:23.712 --> 08:25.839
You could've stayed
in America for that.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.257
You never should
have come here.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.443
[soft upbeat music]

08:46.484 --> 08:48.236
- What shall we toast to?

08:48.278 --> 08:50.947
The German law
that states freedom

08:50.989 --> 08:52.574
is a basic human dignity?

08:52.615 --> 08:55.243
- Whatever. Does it matter?

08:55.285 --> 08:57.120
My friends hate me
and each other,

08:57.162 --> 08:58.329
and all my dreams are dead.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.956
- Oh,
dreams are what your brain does

08:59.998 --> 09:01.332
when it's being lazy.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.877
- [laughs]
Yeah, that's true.

09:06.171 --> 09:07.380
- Ah.

09:07.422 --> 09:10.133
- [gulps]
Ooh, I didn't like that.

09:10.175 --> 09:12.052
I didn't like that.

09:12.093 --> 09:14.179
I'll take a lemon drop.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.056
But hold the sugared rim.

09:16.097 --> 09:18.641
Since I no longer have to worry
about working hard

09:18.683 --> 09:21.227
or pursuing my dreams,
I can dedicate my life

09:21.269 --> 09:22.896
to drinking and being sad,

09:22.937 --> 09:26.232
which is very close to my dream
of drinking and being happy.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.650
Donk-ee.

09:27.692 --> 09:30.320
- That reminds me of when
the wall was constructed

09:30.362 --> 09:31.821
through the middle
of my schoolyard.

09:31.863 --> 09:34.532
It happened so quickly
that many of my friends

09:34.574 --> 09:36.659
were suddenly just
on the other side.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.286
I never saw them again.

I'm sorry, I didn't
hear what you just said.

09:43.708 --> 09:47.003
But on top of losing
the chance at Unity Day

09:47.045 --> 09:50.006
and everyone turning
on each other,

09:50.048 --> 09:51.383
the real kicker,

09:51.424 --> 09:54.135
even Heidi said I shouldn't
have come to Germany.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.889
I really care for her.

09:57.931 --> 10:02.060
If that's how she feels,
there's nothing I can do.

10:02.102 --> 10:06.189
- Well, Bumper, only dead fish
go with the flow.

You are so wise.

10:11.528 --> 10:14.030
You're right. This can't be it.

10:14.072 --> 10:15.615
There has to be something
I could do.

10:15.657 --> 10:17.909
- Oh, I was speaking
about a dire problem

10:17.951 --> 10:19.536
regarding
the hostel's plumbing,

10:19.577 --> 10:22.747
but I'm glad it
also applies here.

German Unity Day
Judge Hans Schroeder,

10:33.091 --> 10:36.052
I know you live here,
'cause the internet told me.

10:36.094 --> 10:39.139
I couldn't find a boombox
at this time of the night,

10:39.180 --> 10:41.766
but luckily,
I got the greatest boombox

10:41.808 --> 10:43.518
of all time right here,

10:43.560 --> 10:45.020

I messed everything up?

Well, I'll show you
how I can...

11:42.118 --> 11:43.286
I'm sorry, officers.

11:43.328 --> 11:45.705
There was a miscommunication--

11:48.958 --> 11:52.253
I can't believe
I'm going to the slammer.

Now Martha Stewart and I
have two things in common.

11:55.715 --> 11:59.052
I also think the secret
is in the marinade.

11:59.094 --> 12:00.512
- The only slammer
you will be going to

12:00.553 --> 12:03.056
is the one that slams you
with medicine and nice care--

12:03.098 --> 12:04.182
the hospital.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.142
- In Germany,
we take drunk people

12:06.184 --> 12:09.187
to the hospital for
a thorough health evaluation.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.314
We rehydrate them, hmm?

12:11.356 --> 12:14.693
So their hangovers are not
too severe and send them home.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.194
- Are you crazy?

12:16.236 --> 12:19.030
I can't go to the hospital.
I don't have any money.

free healthcare

12:31.418 --> 12:35.880

of the drunken and disorderly

personalized stationery

Perhaps you can put

if I deserve it.

I don't know
if I deserve any of you.

you've been through.

you let me down

20:35.026 --> 20:36.361
Uh, cheers.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.362
- Cheers.
- Yes.

20:37.404 --> 20:38.947
- OK, I'd vote for you.

20:38.988 --> 20:40.907
- Oh, thanks.

20:40.949 --> 20:43.326
[coughs]
Seriously, what is in this?

20:43.368 --> 20:46.955
- Rhubarb, salt, and rocks.

20:46.996 --> 20:49.457
- You know, I'm still really
bummed about Unity Day.

20:49.499 --> 20:52.127
I feel like Berlin
has given me so much.

20:52.168 --> 20:54.838
I just wish I could give back
in some small way.

20:54.879 --> 20:56.673
- Well, I wish you could have
the chance to get on stage

20:56.715 --> 20:58.675
at Unity Day to do just that.

21:00.218 --> 21:02.137
- That's all that you need?

21:02.178 --> 21:06.975
Don't you young people know
a stage can be anything?

21:07.017 --> 21:09.060
I once performed
an entire production

21:09.102 --> 21:11.563
of "Die Fledermaus"
on the back of a hearse.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.523
- Wait, Ursula,

21:13.565 --> 21:15.483
are you saying
all the world's a stage,

21:15.525 --> 21:17.068
and I'm a freaking player?

21:17.110 --> 21:18.903
[upbeat music]

21:18.945 --> 21:23.450
Guys, I think we gotta give
Berlin a little prezzy.

21:23.491 --> 21:27.370
* *

21:27.412 --> 21:31.458
- Luckily for us, my apartment
building has a kickass roof.

21:31.499 --> 21:33.752
- Here are the speakers
you requested.

21:33.793 --> 21:36.087
My friend Heinrich
said we can borrow them.

21:36.129 --> 21:38.256
He's owed me a favor
ever since I lent him

21:38.298 --> 21:39.966
one of my cleverest ravens

21:40.008 --> 21:43.178
when he had to solve
that witch's riddle.

21:43.219 --> 21:44.888
- All right, Bumper, ready?

21:44.929 --> 21:47.432
My--wee-wee!--fingers
are getting tired.

21:47.474 --> 21:51.811
- OK, any advice
as my manager before I play?

21:51.853 --> 21:53.063
- No.

21:53.104 --> 21:55.357
But as your friend,
blow the freaking windows

21:55.398 --> 21:56.524
out of Berlin!

21:56.566 --> 21:58.193
Oh, and as a volunteer fireman,

21:58.234 --> 21:59.527
please stay away from the edge.

22:02.614 --> 22:04.157
- Nervous.

22:04.199 --> 22:06.242
Guten tag, Berlin!

22:06.284 --> 22:08.286
My name is Bumper Allen.

22:08.328 --> 22:10.163
Ick liebe dick.

22:10.205 --> 22:12.499
- Oh, no, a jumper!

22:12.540 --> 22:15.627
- Close--a Bumper.

22:18.505 --> 22:21.591
[electric sentimental music]

22:21.633 --> 22:26.930

22:26.971 --> 22:29.432

that do not know me *

22:29.474 --> 22:34.229
* Passing signs all trying
to show me the way back home *

22:34.270 --> 22:36.231
* The way back home *

22:36.272 --> 22:39.693
* A strange man feeling
ever more strange *

22:39.734 --> 22:43.321
* And still trying to find
a way back home *

22:43.363 --> 22:45.490
* A way back home *

22:45.532 --> 22:47.367
* I am turn, turning *

22:47.409 --> 22:50.203
* Into something different
than before *

22:50.245 --> 22:52.455
* 'Cause every turn
I'm turning *

22:52.497 --> 22:54.791
* Takes me to your door *

22:54.833 --> 23:01.548
* What if far and away
doesn't feel so far? *

23:01.589 --> 23:06.136
* What if home's
wherever you are? *

23:06.177 --> 23:09.472
* I'm already home
if I'm where you are *

23:09.514 --> 23:12.684
[crowd cheering]

23:19.691 --> 23:21.276
Thank you, Berlin!

23:21.317 --> 23:23.737
Enjoy your morning coffee!

23:23.778 --> 23:25.822
- Whoo!
- That was beautiful, Bumper!

23:25.864 --> 23:27.615
I usually dislike
love songs, OK?

23:27.657 --> 23:31.745
But I just imagined you were
singing to a spider or a bat.

23:31.786 --> 23:34.205
- For sure.
- I knew you had it in you.

23:34.247 --> 23:35.874
I'm going to say to you
what my own father

23:35.915 --> 23:37.334
will never say to me.

23:37.375 --> 23:40.170
I am so proud of you,
my son, Pieter Kramer,

23:40.211 --> 23:43.340
and I think you are smart
enough to wear laced shoes.

23:43.381 --> 23:45.216
- OK. Yeah.

23:47.344 --> 23:48.720
- Uh-oh.

23:48.762 --> 23:51.181
- That's fine. I'll go freely.

23:51.222 --> 23:52.724
I will die for my music.

23:54.684 --> 23:56.394
- Thank you.

23:56.436 --> 23:58.021
Well, well, well.

23:58.063 --> 24:00.440
If it isn't Bumper Allen,
which it is.

24:00.482 --> 24:02.650
We've been holding Unity Day
auditions next door,

24:02.692 --> 24:06.071
and half of our acts left
to watch you.

24:06.112 --> 24:07.822
I'm sure that wasn't
a coincidence.

24:07.864 --> 24:09.824
- Nope, it wasn't.

24:09.866 --> 24:11.951
I figured if the auditions
don't go to us,

24:11.993 --> 24:13.536
we'll go to the auditions.

24:13.578 --> 24:15.205
- Wait a second.

24:15.246 --> 24:16.790
This is not
your apartment building?

24:16.831 --> 24:18.208
- Oh, hell no, dog.

24:18.249 --> 24:19.709
I just followed someone in
because it's next door

24:19.751 --> 24:21.211
to the Unity Day offices.

24:21.252 --> 24:23.797
We rock and rolled
and broke and entered.

24:23.838 --> 24:25.048
- Apparently
loud in front of them.

24:25.090 --> 24:26.299
- Yeah, oops.

24:26.341 --> 24:28.802
- Well, it appears
Berlin loves your song.

24:28.843 --> 24:30.136
I mean,
a lot of those people were

24:30.178 --> 24:32.013
drunk from the night before,
- I could tell.

24:32.055 --> 24:33.390
I was drunk when
I wrote the song.

24:33.431 --> 24:34.974
- That's true.

24:35.016 --> 24:37.185
- But against all odds, you've
generated genuine enthusiasm.

24:37.227 --> 24:39.896
And you may still be
a controversial figure,

24:39.938 --> 24:42.148
but it's clear you did
a good job with Bumper.

24:42.190 --> 24:43.316
- Yes, he did.

24:43.358 --> 24:45.068
He's a great manager
and a great friend.

24:45.110 --> 24:47.737
He knows all the coolest roofs
to book me on

24:47.779 --> 24:49.322
and tells me when I have
chocolate on my face,

24:49.364 --> 24:50.699
which is a lot.

24:50.740 --> 24:52.742
I eat a chocolate sundae
every morning for breakfast.

24:52.784 --> 24:55.412
Classic style.
- He does. He shares.

24:55.453 --> 24:57.205
Fine, we both do it.

24:57.247 --> 24:58.665
You've converted me.

24:58.707 --> 25:01.418
- It seems that our country
has two deserving newcomer

25:01.459 --> 25:03.044
acts this year.

25:03.086 --> 25:04.754
We'd like to offer you
the opportunity

25:04.796 --> 25:07.424
to share the spot with Gisela.

25:07.465 --> 25:09.884
For the first time,
we can have two newcomers

25:09.926 --> 25:12.095
in the spirit of unity.

25:12.137 --> 25:13.471
- Yes.

25:13.513 --> 25:16.266
- In the spirit of unity.

25:16.307 --> 25:19.269
Mwah!

25:19.310 --> 25:20.812
I didn't know what to do.
- It works.

25:20.854 --> 25:23.898
- I kind of freaked out.
- That's fine. Toodles.

25:23.940 --> 25:27.110
[all screaming]

25:27.152 --> 25:28.194

Whoo!

25:30.238 --> 25:32.490
[all screaming]

25:32.532 --> 25:34.117
OK, but seriously,
now we have to go because we

25:34.159 --> 25:35.285
did break and enter.
- Yeah, OK, yep.

25:35.326 --> 25:36.411
- Oh, yeah.

25:36.453 --> 25:37.620
- Can we just leave everything?

25:37.662 --> 25:40.165
- Just throw it off the side!
- OK.

25:40.206 --> 25:42.417
- Oh! I missed it!
All right, listen, watch this.

25:42.459 --> 25:44.627
Oh, miss it, miss it, miss it.

Man, hot dogs in Germany
are so much more fun

25:51.343 --> 25:52.552
than hot dogs in America.

25:52.594 --> 25:55.263
I love slurping me down
some German wieners.

25:55.305 --> 25:57.140
- I still can't believe
that my client

25:57.182 --> 25:59.976
has secured the coveted
newcomer spot at Unity Day.

You are German
like a Grimm brother.

26:01.978 --> 26:03.813
- Wilhelm.
- Oh, yes.

26:03.855 --> 26:04.731
- Because I do not
mess with Jacob.

26:04.773 --> 26:05.982
- Nasty.

26:06.024 --> 26:06.941
- Yeah, that guy's
a psychopath.

26:06.983 --> 26:08.193
- Killed several sheep.

26:08.234 --> 26:09.319
- Man, I freaking love you,
dude.

26:09.361 --> 26:10.695
- I love you as well.

26:14.199 --> 26:15.658
That was the first time
ever doing that.

26:15.700 --> 26:16.868
- Oh, really?
- It was terrible.

26:16.910 --> 26:18.161
I apologize.

26:18.203 --> 26:19.371
- We should, like,
practice it or something.

26:19.412 --> 26:20.663
- Allow me to rehearse
in the mirror

26:20.705 --> 26:22.165
for several hours tonight.

26:22.207 --> 26:24.501
- You don't have to.
- OK.

26:24.542 --> 26:27.170
- I just can't believe
we actually did it.

26:27.212 --> 26:28.922
- I can.

26:28.963 --> 26:30.840
I always knew you could.

because I don't have my pen.

you are being deported
