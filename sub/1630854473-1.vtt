29:26.765 --> 29:29.392
[Weems] Dr. Kinbott's office
is on the second floor.

29:29.476 --> 29:31.603
Other Nevermore students swear by her.

29:32.645 --> 29:34.272
You'll be here until I'm done?

29:34.939 --> 29:37.901
Perhaps afterwards we can visit
the Weathervane for hot chocolate.

29:37.984 --> 29:41.237
Principal Weems, this feeble attempt
at bonding is beneath you.

29:44.199 --> 29:47.410
And chauffeuring your students around
is below your pay grade.

29:47.994 --> 29:51.247
Given your history,
I'm sure you're intent on running away.

29:53.458 --> 29:55.627
I'm here to prevent that from happening.

29:57.587 --> 29:58.713
I wish you luck.

29:59.506 --> 30:00.507
[door slams]

30:03.426 --> 30:05.512
I read the notes
from your school counselor.

30:05.595 --> 30:08.681
Mrs. Bronstein. She had
a nervous breakdown after our last session

30:08.765 --> 30:10.725
and had to take a six-month sabbatical.

30:11.684 --> 30:13.061
Go ahead and take a seat.

30:15.146 --> 30:16.689
How did you feel about that?

30:16.773 --> 30:17.899
Vindicated.

30:17.982 --> 30:20.860
But someone who crochets
for a hobby isn't a worthy adversary.

30:21.611 --> 30:22.779
Adversary?

30:22.862 --> 30:26.366
I hope we can forge a relationship
based on trust and mutual respect.

30:26.449 --> 30:28.827
-[scoffs]
-This is a safe space, Wednesday.

30:28.910 --> 30:31.329
A sanctuary where we can discuss anything.

30:31.412 --> 30:33.581
What you're thinking, feeling,

30:33.665 --> 30:35.750
your views on the world,
personal philosophy.

30:35.834 --> 30:39.128
That's easy.
I think that this is a waste of time.

30:39.712 --> 30:41.881
I see the world
as a place that must be endured,

30:41.965 --> 30:44.551
and my personal philosophy
is kill or be killed.

30:45.051 --> 30:47.679
So, for instance,
when someone bullies your brother,

30:47.762 --> 30:50.014
your response is
to dump piranha in the pool.

30:50.098 --> 30:53.184
You know the old saying,
never bring a knife to a sword fight.

30:54.519 --> 30:55.687
Unless it's concealed.

30:56.271 --> 30:58.982
Point is, you assaulted a boy,
and showed no remorse for your actions.

30:59.065 --> 31:01.776
-That's why you're here.
-He lost a testicle.

31:02.652 --> 31:05.655
I did the world a favor.
People like Dalton shouldn't procreate.

31:05.738 --> 31:07.490
I've answered all your questions.

31:08.157 --> 31:09.409
We're not done yet.

31:09.492 --> 31:10.952
[mysterious notes play]

31:12.829 --> 31:15.999
Therapy is a valuable tool
to help you understand yourself.

31:16.082 --> 31:18.501
It can teach you new ways
to deal with your emotions.

31:18.585 --> 31:21.129
It can also help you build
a life that you want.

31:21.212 --> 31:22.922
I know the life that I want.

31:23.590 --> 31:24.591
Tell me about it.

31:26.342 --> 31:29.345
Everything said in these sessions
is strictly confidential.

31:32.015 --> 31:34.434
Do your plans involve becoming an author?

31:34.517 --> 31:36.269
I understand you've written three novels

31:36.352 --> 31:38.938
about a teen girl detective,
Viper De La Muerte.

31:40.064 --> 31:41.441
Can you tell me about her?

31:41.524 --> 31:44.068
Viper is smart, perceptive,
chronically misunderstood.

31:44.152 --> 31:45.904
Any luck getting your work published?

31:47.739 --> 31:50.658
Editors are short-sighted,
fear-based life forms.

31:50.742 --> 31:53.119
One once described my writing
as gratuitously morbid,

31:53.202 --> 31:55.121
and suggested I seek psychiatric help.

31:55.204 --> 31:56.205
[Kinbott] Hmm.

31:56.289 --> 31:57.498
Ironic, isn't it?

31:58.082 --> 31:59.542
How did you take that?

32:01.002 --> 32:02.670
I sent her a "thank you."

32:02.754 --> 32:06.549
[mischievous music playing]

32:08.051 --> 32:09.469
[screams]

32:11.387 --> 32:13.848
I've always been open
to constructive criticism.

32:14.641 --> 32:15.850
I'm glad to hear that.

32:16.351 --> 32:19.437
Because I was sent the manuscripts
as part of your psych evaluation.

32:19.520 --> 32:21.397
The relationship I found most intriguing

32:21.481 --> 32:23.608
was that of Viper
and her mother, Dominica.

32:24.984 --> 32:26.486
Why don't we dig into that?

32:29.238 --> 32:32.784
Part of this journey requires us
going to uncomfortable places emotionally.

32:32.867 --> 32:34.077
I don't travel well.

32:36.162 --> 32:38.498
Would you mind if I use
the powder room first?

32:38.581 --> 32:42.043
[tense music builds, fades away]

[clattering]

32:50.843 --> 32:51.803
[Kinbott] Wednesday?

32:51.886 --> 32:53.346
Is everything okay?

32:55.431 --> 32:57.558
You can't hide
for the rest of the session.

32:57.642 --> 32:58.643
[Wednesday] I'm all right.

32:58.726 --> 33:02.355
Just preparing myself
for our uncomfortable journey.

33:03.982 --> 33:04.941
Nail file.

33:06.526 --> 33:09.028
[dark electronic arrangement
of theme music playing]

33:28.464 --> 33:33.553
On Saturday, I can do in the afternoon,
sometime around four o'clock?

33:48.526 --> 33:50.403
You goddamn weirdo.

[espresso machine whirs, hisses]

34:05.877 --> 34:07.086
Holy crap!

34:07.170 --> 34:10.048
Do you make a habit
of scaring the hell out of people?

34:10.131 --> 34:11.466
It's more of a hobby.

34:12.633 --> 34:13.885
You go to Nevermore.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.721
Didn't realize they changed the uniform.

34:16.804 --> 34:18.097
I need a quad over ice.

34:18.181 --> 34:19.182
It's an emergency.

34:21.434 --> 34:22.935
It's four shots of espresso.

34:23.019 --> 34:24.687
Yeah, I… I know what a quad is,

34:24.771 --> 34:28.232
but, spoiler alert,
the espresso machine's having a seizure,

34:28.316 --> 34:29.567
so all we have is drip.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.778
But drip is for people who hate themselves

34:31.861 --> 34:34.197
and know their lives
have no real purpose or meaning.

34:37.658 --> 34:39.327
What's wrong with your machine?

34:39.410 --> 34:41.621
It's a temperamental beast
with a mind of its own,

34:41.704 --> 34:44.540
and it doesn't help
that the instructions are in Italian.

34:49.504 --> 34:53.257
I need a tri-wing screwdriver
and a four-millimeter Allen wrench.

34:53.341 --> 34:55.510
Wait, you read Italian?

34:56.469 --> 34:58.930
Of course.
It's the native tongue of Machiavelli.

34:59.889 --> 35:02.308
Here's the deal.
I'm going to fix your coffee machine,

35:02.391 --> 35:04.435
then you're going to make my coffee
and call a taxi.

35:04.519 --> 35:07.855
Uh, no taxis in Jericho.

35:07.939 --> 35:08.940
Try Uber?

35:09.023 --> 35:12.026
I don't have a phone.
I refuse to be a slave to technology.

35:13.277 --> 35:14.529
Then you're out of luck.

35:14.612 --> 35:16.155
Where you going anyway?

35:16.239 --> 35:19.242
That's on a need-to-know basis.
What about trains?

35:20.243 --> 35:23.246
Nearest station is Burlington.
It's half an hour away.

35:23.329 --> 35:25.873
You have a valve issue.
I've seen it before.

35:27.083 --> 35:29.418
Where? You have
one of these monsters at home?

35:29.502 --> 35:32.338

I built it when I was ten.

more efficiently.

I never met a Nevermore kid
who got their hands dirty.

35:53.776 --> 35:55.528
I'm Tyler, by the way.

35:55.611 --> 35:58.823

or is that on a need-to-know basis too?

36:01.993 --> 36:03.035
Tell you what, Wednesday.

36:03.119 --> 36:06.330
To show my appreciation,
how about I drive you to Burlington?

36:06.414 --> 36:08.875
Perfect. Put that quad in a to-go cup.

36:08.958 --> 36:11.419
Uh, but I don't get off for another hour.

36:13.504 --> 36:14.589
I'll sweeten the pot.

Tempting, but no.

Uh…

Listen, Wednesday, one fun fact about me…

36:28.269 --> 36:32.773

or find someone else to drive you.

like religious fanatics?

37:15.816 --> 37:18.027
-We're pilgrims.
-Potato, po-tah-to.

37:18.110 --> 37:19.403
We work at Pilgrim World.

37:23.616 --> 37:26.285
It takes a special kind of stupid
to devote an entire theme park

37:26.369 --> 37:28.537

in a Tibetan Monastery.

Yeah, she says
there's a chance I may never…

You really suck at this.

43:40.951 --> 43:42.202
Cheering people up.

43:43.954 --> 43:45.664
[cries shakily]

43:46.540 --> 43:48.876
-Why are you crying?
-Because I'm upset!

43:50.002 --> 43:52.504
Haven't you ever cried,
or are you above that too?

43:58.218 --> 44:00.137
It was the week after Halloween.

44:03.265 --> 44:04.725
I was six years old.

44:07.019 --> 44:09.730
I took my pet scorpion, Nero,
out for his afternoon stroll,

44:09.813 --> 44:11.065
and we were ambushed.

44:16.362 --> 44:19.281
They wondered what kind of freak
would have a scorpion for a pet.

44:19.365 --> 44:20.324
[boy] Yeah.

44:23.661 --> 44:25.788
Two of them held me down
and made me watch…

44:28.916 --> 44:30.417
[bullies laughing]

44:32.711 --> 44:33.712
[gasps]

44:33.796 --> 44:34.797
[Nero squelching]

44:35.297 --> 44:38.842
…while the others ran Nero over until…

44:41.595 --> 44:43.597
[forlorn music playing]

44:47.476 --> 44:50.145
It was snowing
when I buried what was left of him.

44:53.107 --> 44:55.275
I cried my little black heart out.

45:00.572 --> 45:02.574
But tears don't fix anything.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.955
So I vowed to never do it again.

45:08.539 --> 45:10.708
[Furs continue baying]

45:17.464 --> 45:18.674
Your secret's safe with me.

45:21.510 --> 45:23.595
Still think you're weird as shit, though.

45:24.304 --> 45:26.014
The feeling is incredibly mutual.

45:30.185 --> 45:32.438
How would you like your single room back?

45:32.521 --> 45:34.982
You just need to show me
how to use your computer.

45:38.986 --> 45:40.779
[rapid knocking]

45:40.863 --> 45:42.865
[suspenseful music building]

45:48.203 --> 45:49.788
Holy shit!

46:00.215 --> 46:02.176
[tapping]

46:03.010 --> 46:03.844
Okay.

46:05.512 --> 46:08.599
Okay, I'm taking orders from a hand.

46:09.933 --> 46:12.019
This isn't weird at all.

46:18.275 --> 46:19.318
[ring tone trills]

46:21.111 --> 46:22.029
[video call whooshes]

46:22.613 --> 46:24.573
Uh… hi.

46:25.699 --> 46:26.742
That's Thing.

46:27.743 --> 46:30.287
Is he, like, your pet?

46:32.664 --> 46:33.791
He's sensitive.

46:33.874 --> 46:37.336
Look, I know Nevermore
is ground zero for all things weird,

46:37.419 --> 46:39.838
but this is next-level.

46:40.506 --> 46:43.634
So, what happened to not
wanting to be a slave to technology?

46:43.717 --> 46:44.927
Desperate times.

46:45.010 --> 46:46.553
Are you still willing to help me escape?

46:46.637 --> 46:50.057
After what happened today,
I figured they'd have you in solitary.

46:50.140 --> 46:53.560
There's the Harvest Festival this weekend.
Attendance is mandatory.

46:53.644 --> 46:55.062
I'm going to use it as a cover.

46:55.145 --> 46:57.356
If you're willing
to drive me to the station,

46:57.439 --> 46:58.982
I can make it worth your while.

47:01.652 --> 47:02.820
I'm in.

47:02.903 --> 47:04.822
And no charge.

47:04.905 --> 47:06.240
Consider it a freebie.

47:07.282 --> 47:08.367
Why?

47:08.450 --> 47:10.035
'Cause I wish I was going with you.

47:11.119 --> 47:13.705
At least one of us
will get out of this hellhole town.

47:17.876 --> 47:19.878
[crowd chatters, laughs]

47:25.592 --> 47:27.719
Are you sure you can trust that normie?

47:27.803 --> 47:30.013
Dad, I didn't know
they were gonna be here.

47:30.097 --> 47:32.307
I trust that I can handle myself.

47:32.391 --> 47:34.643
I don't want you talking to her.
I want you home by 12:00.

47:34.726 --> 47:36.311
-1:00.
-12:30.

47:36.395 --> 47:37.229
[Enid] Well,

47:38.272 --> 47:40.440
good luck and safe travels.

47:42.067 --> 47:44.236
Still not a hugger. Got it.

47:49.157 --> 47:50.367
[tense music builds]

48:07.092 --> 48:09.094
[tense music trails off]

48:18.979 --> 48:22.858
Jeez, you get any better at this,
you'll be taking home a whole pack.

48:22.941 --> 48:25.652
Pandas don't travel in packs.
They prefer solitude.

48:26.778 --> 48:28.655
All right. Subtle hint taken.

48:30.490 --> 48:32.492
You should know I'm waiting for someone.

48:32.576 --> 48:35.454
Oh yeah, who's the lucky guy… or girl?

48:35.954 --> 48:37.080
What does it matter to you?

48:39.082 --> 48:40.667
Didn't mean to interrupt.

48:40.751 --> 48:41.710
You're not.

48:45.464 --> 48:47.090
This is gonna be trickier than I thought.

48:47.174 --> 48:50.010
Dad hit me with a curfew. We need to go
if I'm gonna make it back in time.

48:50.093 --> 48:52.471
I've got some dead weight
I need to lose first.

48:53.847 --> 48:56.600
Meet me behind the parking lot
when the fireworks start.

49:00.604 --> 49:02.981
You see that sad, lonely woman over there?

49:04.316 --> 49:07.069
She needs this pathetic validation
more than I do.

49:08.028 --> 49:09.529
Would you mind distracting her?

49:13.325 --> 49:15.160
[panda] I love you. I love you.

49:20.290 --> 49:22.125
[fireworks crackling]

49:25.629 --> 49:29.299
Hey, before you leave,
I wanted you to have this.

49:30.258 --> 49:33.136
It's your dad's police file
from when he was at Nevermore.

49:33.220 --> 49:35.305
I think it's the reason my dad hates him.

49:37.140 --> 49:38.308
You okay?

49:40.894 --> 49:43.146
I'm not used to people engaging with me.

49:43.814 --> 49:45.816
Most see me coming and cross the street.

49:45.899 --> 49:47.901
You're not scary. You're just kinda…

49:49.569 --> 49:50.404
kooky.

49:52.489 --> 49:53.824
I prefer spooky.

49:53.907 --> 49:54.741
Oh.

49:55.409 --> 49:58.161
Now my train leaves in an hour.
We're burning moonlight.

49:58.870 --> 50:00.664
Uh, right, right.

50:00.747 --> 50:02.749
[low, menacing music playing]

50:03.250 --> 50:04.084
Hey.

50:05.752 --> 50:07.295
Come on, Wednesday. Wednesday!

50:07.379 --> 50:09.172
We can lose them in the crowd.

50:22.561 --> 50:23.603
Oh, whoa!

50:23.687 --> 50:26.356
[cryptic, high-pitched tones play]

50:29.776 --> 50:30.861
[caws]

50:32.154 --> 50:33.822
[wails]

50:33.905 --> 50:34.781
[flesh rending]

50:37.451 --> 50:38.452
Shit.

50:38.535 --> 50:40.328
Wednesday, we need to go.

50:40.412 --> 50:41.788
Wednesday, come on.

50:42.998 --> 50:44.416
-Wednesday!
-Rowan, come back!

50:58.930 --> 51:00.432
Rowan, wait!

51:00.515 --> 51:03.560
What do you want?
Why are you following me?

51:03.643 --> 51:06.104
I don't have time to explain,
but you're in danger.

51:08.356 --> 51:09.274
[chuckles]

51:11.902 --> 51:13.695
I think you've got it backwards.

51:16.907 --> 51:17.741
[grunts]

51:19.910 --> 51:22.621
-You're the one who's in danger.
-What are you doing?

51:22.704 --> 51:24.331
Saving everyone from you.

51:24.414 --> 51:25.665
[grunts] I have to kill you.

51:27.084 --> 51:29.211
The gargoyle, that was you?

51:29.294 --> 51:30.295
Yeah.

51:32.005 --> 51:33.256
It's always the quiet ones.

51:35.300 --> 51:37.719
[ominous whooshing]

51:37.803 --> 51:40.013
[Rowan] Girl in the picture. That's you.

51:45.435 --> 51:47.104
You want to kill me
because of some picture?

51:47.187 --> 51:51.817
My mother drew that picture 25 years ago
when she was a student at Nevermore.

51:51.900 --> 51:53.819
She was a powerful Seer.

51:55.529 --> 51:58.782
-Told me about it before she died.
-Rowan, put me down.

51:58.865 --> 52:01.118
No! My mother said it was my destiny

52:01.201 --> 52:03.578
to stop this girl
if she ever came to Nevermore,

52:03.662 --> 52:07.040
because she will
destroy the school and everyone in it.

52:07.124 --> 52:09.126
-[arcane power surges]
-[grunts]

52:09.209 --> 52:10.293
Rowan.

52:10.877 --> 52:11.711
Rowan.

52:11.795 --> 52:15.173
[tense, frenetic music playing]

52:16.883 --> 52:17.884
[bestial snarl]

-[flesh rending]

52:33.900 --> 52:36.319
[raspy growling]

53:22.699 --> 53:24.534
Hello, my little black cloud.

53:26.077 --> 53:28.663
So tell us darling,
how was your first week?

53:29.372 --> 53:30.916
[Wednesday] Let's see.

53:30.999 --> 53:33.168
I narrowly avoided death twice,

53:33.251 --> 53:35.879
discovered that my father
may be a murderer,

53:35.962 --> 53:38.590
learned that I could
potentially destroy the school,

53:38.673 --> 53:41.927
and was mysteriously saved
by a homicidal monster.

53:42.761 --> 53:45.680
As much as it pains me to admit,
you were right, Mother.

53:46.681 --> 53:48.683
I think I'm going to love it here.

53:51.853 --> 53:54.022
[dramatic music swells]

53:54.105 --> 53:56.399
[narrator] This season on Wednesday…

53:56.524 --> 53:58.902
[Wednesday] This story's
about to take a dark turn.

54:00.195 --> 54:01.071
Luckily,

54:02.030 --> 54:03.823
I'm not afraid of the dark.

54:05.200 --> 54:08.370
There's a monster out there,
but everyone believes I made it all up.

54:08.453 --> 54:11.581
I need to find something
that can prove I haven't lost my mind.

54:12.707 --> 54:15.585
[Tyler] You're really obsessed with
this monster-in-the-woods thing.

54:15.669 --> 54:18.546
Would you rather I develop an obsession
with horses and boy bands?

54:19.714 --> 54:21.341
So, tell us everything.

54:21.424 --> 54:24.928
[Wednesday] Since you've abandoned me,
I've been hunted, haunted,

54:25.011 --> 54:26.930
and the target of an attempted murder.

54:27.722 --> 54:30.517
Ah, Nevermore, I love you so!

54:30.600 --> 54:32.185
[creature snarls, growls]

54:33.311 --> 54:37.190
How do you manage to end up at the center
of every terrible thing that happens here?

54:37.274 --> 54:38.358
Incredible luck.

54:38.441 --> 54:40.068
[all screaming]

54:40.151 --> 54:41.778
[Wednesday] You insisted
I go to this school.

54:41.861 --> 54:44.281
Did you really think
I wouldn't find out your secret?

54:44.364 --> 54:45.657
You don't know the full story.

54:46.950 --> 54:49.494
When I suggested giving
your side of the room a makeover,

54:49.577 --> 54:52.998
I did not have
Ted Bundy's Pinterest in mind. Ew.

54:54.416 --> 54:56.084
[Wednesday] This ends now.

54:56.167 --> 54:58.003
[dramatic music intensifies]

55:03.800 --> 55:05.593
If you hear me screaming bloody murder,

55:05.677 --> 55:07.595
there's a good chance
I'm just enjoying myself.

55:08.179 --> 55:10.265
[narrator] Watch all episodes now.

55:12.976 --> 55:14.978
