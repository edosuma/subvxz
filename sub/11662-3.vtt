(serene music playing)

01:04.367 --> 01:05.633
Smells good.

01:05.700 --> 01:07.333
Here, pussycat, taste this.

01:09.367 --> 01:12.500
Ooh, Mom.

01:12.567 --> 01:14.600
"Bring to a near boil."

01:14.667 --> 01:15.567
Perfect.

01:18.233 --> 01:21.433
Ma, I could have burned my lips.
What are you doing?

01:21.500 --> 01:25.500
My eyesight is going
so I like a prank I can hear.

01:25.567 --> 01:27.300
Rose Nylund,

01:27.367 --> 01:30.500
what's that velvet painting
of dogs playing poker

01:30.567 --> 01:32.533
doing out on my front lawn?

01:32.600 --> 01:35.400
Intriguing passersby
if I know my art lovers.

01:36.767 --> 01:39.967
And the clothes, trunk,
and boxes?

01:40.033 --> 01:42.300
You're not having a yard sale,
are you?

01:42.367 --> 01:43.500
What's wrong with that?

01:43.567 --> 01:47.767
I don't want to deal with 400 people
in <i>Simpsons</i> T-shirts

01:47.834 --> 01:52.133
trying to knock 25 cents off your
"I lost my ass in Vegas" cup.

01:53.133 --> 01:56.200
Is my cup out there?
I don't wanna sell my cup.

01:56.266 --> 01:57.200
Come on, Blanche.

01:57.266 --> 02:00.800
There's nothing wrong with Rose
having a yard sale. Right, Ma?

02:00.867 --> 02:01.967
Here, Blanche, taste this.

02:02.033 --> 02:03.166
Ma!

02:04.166 --> 02:06.967
I just hate the idea of a yard sale.

02:07.033 --> 02:12.300
If you're really getting rid of your
stuff, I'll take it for, say, $50.

02:12.367 --> 02:14.600
Ok, but a deal's a deal.

02:14.667 --> 02:16.734
I don't want you to say you didn't
get your money's worth

02:16.800 --> 02:18.400
because something doesn't fit

02:18.467 --> 02:23.100
or smells bad
or makes strangers giggle.

02:24.934 --> 02:27.300
Good God!
What do you have in those boxes?

02:27.800 --> 02:31.066
As we say in St. Olaf,
crapola in a box.

02:33.033 --> 02:34.467
-(doorbell rings)
-Excuse me.

02:34.533 --> 02:37.800
I can't stand her
when she's feeling her oats.

02:37.867 --> 02:40.567
Rose, you're a sharp deal-maker.

02:40.633 --> 02:43.033
We've all underestimated you.

02:43.100 --> 02:45.734
Now come over here.
Taste this.

02:48.066 --> 02:50.600
-Ow!
-Ma, stop that!

02:54.333 --> 02:56.066
Hi, it's me, Stan.

02:56.133 --> 02:57.600
Stanley, what do you want?

02:57.667 --> 03:00.467
Turn on your TV.
It's almost 6:28.

03:00.533 --> 03:02.000
What's happening at 6:28?

03:02.066 --> 03:05.266
You'll find out why Stan Zbornak
is now a very rich man.

03:05.333 --> 03:07.133
What is it this time,

03:07.200 --> 03:10.700
whoopee cushions
for the hearing impaired?

03:10.767 --> 03:13.300
It's not a novelty. It's a Zbornee.

03:13.367 --> 03:14.433
What's a Zbornee?

03:14.500 --> 03:18.834
I put up with it for 38 years.
You don't want to know.

03:18.900 --> 03:22.300
It's not that, Dorothy.
I just used the same name.

03:25.633 --> 03:27.300
So, what is it, Stanley?

03:27.367 --> 03:29.233
I'll show you. It's time.

03:29.300 --> 03:32.200
<i>Hi, it's me, Stan Zbornak,</i>

03:32.266 --> 03:35.033
<i>and you may be wondering</i>
<i>why I'm dressed like a potato.</i>

03:35.100 --> 03:36.800
That's what's different.

03:38.600 --> 03:41.533
<i>It's because</i>
<i>I've invented the Zbornee,</i>

03:41.600 --> 03:43.967
<i>America's first baked potato opener.</i>

03:44.033 --> 03:47.200
<i>Now you can open potatoes</i>
<i>without burning your fingers.</i>

03:47.266 --> 03:49.200
No! It can't be done!

03:50.967 --> 03:54.834
<i>It can be done</i>
<i>and for only 12.95.</i>

03:54.900 --> 03:58.033
<i>Over a half a million Zbornees</i>
<i>have already been sold.</i>

03:58.100 --> 04:00.467
<i>Call this toll-free number now.</i>

04:00.533 --> 04:02.533
<i>Remember, with the Zbornee,</i>

04:02.600 --> 04:06.734
<i>a day without potatoes</i>
<i>is unnecessary.</i>

04:06.800 --> 04:08.533
That's my line.

04:08.600 --> 04:11.800
Hi, I'd like to order the Zbornee.

04:11.867 --> 04:13.533
Rose, will you hang up?

04:13.600 --> 04:18.500
Times 500,000...
Stan, you're rich!

04:18.567 --> 04:21.066
-That is fantastic.
-Congratulations.

04:21.133 --> 04:23.100
I know I called you
a yutz in the past.

04:23.166 --> 04:27.567
What I didn't tell you is that
in Sicilian yutz means apollo.

04:29.333 --> 04:31.033
Ma, stop that.

04:31.100 --> 04:33.033
It wouldn't hurt you
to learn to kiss up.

04:35.033 --> 04:36.100
Stanley, one question.

04:36.166 --> 04:39.433
If things are going so well,
what is it you want?

04:39.500 --> 04:41.100
Glad you asked, babe.

04:41.166 --> 04:42.433
I need your help.

04:42.500 --> 04:45.433
I want to export the Zbornee
to Japan.

04:45.500 --> 04:49.467
Our research shows
the Japanese actually hate rice,

04:49.533 --> 04:50.734
but what they hate more

04:50.800 --> 04:53.266
is burning their fingers
on baked potatoes.

04:53.333 --> 04:54.867
Anyway, Dorothy,

04:54.934 --> 04:57.800
a major Japanese distributor
is arriving next week.

04:57.867 --> 05:00.667
Zbornco is throwing a big reception.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.333
I need a date. Go with me.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.900
Sorry, Stan. There are other
vegetables I'd rather go out with.

05:08.066 --> 05:10.066
Dorothy, I need
someone who is classy,

05:10.133 --> 05:14.667
someone who can handle the rich,
someone not too obviously sexy.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.600
Why don't you ask Merv Griffin?

05:23.200 --> 05:25.700
Look,
I called every woman in my rolodex.

05:25.767 --> 05:27.100
I'm down to the Z's.

05:27.166 --> 05:28.500
That means either you or my mother.

05:28.567 --> 05:31.767
Mom chews too loud
and still calls them Japs.

05:32.900 --> 05:33.900
What do you say, babe?

05:34.000 --> 05:37.033
As they say in Japan,
sayonara, Stanley.

05:37.100 --> 05:39.667
That's another reason,
you know the language.

05:41.633 --> 05:46.033
(mellow music playing)

05:46.100 --> 05:47.066
Hi, Blanche.

05:47.133 --> 05:49.500
You know that stuff
you sold me,

05:49.567 --> 05:52.367
that St. Olaf memorabilia and
the things from your childhood?

05:52.433 --> 05:53.834
A lifetime of memories.

05:53.900 --> 05:54.734
That's it.

05:54.800 --> 06:00.033
Well, I came across these as I was
tossing that junk in the dumpster.

06:02.233 --> 06:04.667
That's a St. Olaf war bond.

06:04.734 --> 06:08.300
Charlie bought us those in '42.
I didn't realize I still had those.

06:08.367 --> 06:12.300
Are you telling me St. Olaf printed
its own war bonds?

06:12.367 --> 06:14.734
Yes. We were very patriotic.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.867
In late '42, we wanted
to fund the development

06:17.934 --> 06:21.734
of a top-secret weapon that
we were sure would end the war,

06:21.800 --> 06:24.066
attack cows.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.233
Take me now, Lord.

06:33.233 --> 06:36.633
No one expects trouble from a cow.

06:36.700 --> 06:40.300
The plan was we would drop
these highly trained killer cows

06:40.367 --> 06:42.867
behind the enemy lines.

06:42.934 --> 06:44.433
It wasn't till they were airborne

06:44.500 --> 06:47.700
that we realized a cow
can't pull a rip cord.

06:49.633 --> 06:51.800
The project wasn't a total failure.

06:51.867 --> 06:55.300
If there's one thing
the Germans hate, it's a mess.

06:57.734 --> 07:00.867
Just tell me, is this damn
bond worth anything?

07:00.934 --> 07:03.734
Well, yes, $1,000. $1,000?

07:03.800 --> 07:07.133
Hot damn! I have 49 more of them.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.600
We're rich!

07:08.667 --> 07:10.734
You're half right.

07:12.300 --> 07:15.433
Blanche, you just paid $50 for
those. You should split them.

07:15.500 --> 07:18.767
Split them?
Are you kidding?

07:18.834 --> 07:20.500
I paid for these fair and square.

07:20.567 --> 07:22.467
You said yourself
all deals are final.

07:22.533 --> 07:24.400
Charlie would want me
to have them.

07:24.467 --> 07:26.300
George would want me
to keep them.

07:27.867 --> 07:29.633
Don't try that with me,
Rose Nylund.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.900
I'll match you dead husband
for dead husband.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.233
You are not going to believe this.

07:36.300 --> 07:38.166
I told Stan I didn't want to go.

07:38.233 --> 07:40.166
He sent me a kimono.

07:40.233 --> 07:42.800
Do you know what
I would look like in a kimono?

07:48.333 --> 07:50.133
No, I have no idea.

07:52.433 --> 07:54.533
And listen to this,

07:54.600 --> 07:57.400
"Dear Dorothy,
in case you change your mind,

07:57.467 --> 08:00.400
here are three things to
remember at the cocktail party,

08:00.467 --> 08:03.900
number one,
ask for more potatoes.

08:03.967 --> 08:05.934
Number two, be appalled that

08:06.000 --> 08:09.467
Joe Isuzu wasn't played
by an Asian actor.

08:11.467 --> 08:12.533
And number three,

08:12.600 --> 08:16.767
under no circumstances
walk on their backs.

08:16.834 --> 08:19.233
Even if they beg you.

08:19.300 --> 08:21.333
And they will.

08:21.400 --> 08:24.500
I hope you'll reconsider.
Have a potato day.

08:24.567 --> 08:27.667
See you later, tater.
Your spuddy, Stan."

08:28.166 --> 08:31.133
I can't believe it. One beer.

08:31.200 --> 08:34.800
One beer in high school,
and my life is ruined.

08:36.066 --> 08:38.200
He's trying to buy my love.

08:38.266 --> 08:40.066
He's trying to buy
my kids' love.

08:40.133 --> 08:43.767
If I had a dollar for every time
Stan has screwed up our lives...

08:43.834 --> 08:46.300
Here you go, pussycat.

08:46.367 --> 08:48.033
Ma, where did you get that money?

08:48.100 --> 08:49.633
Stan gave it to me.

08:49.700 --> 08:52.667
Ma, he's trying to buy your love.

08:52.734 --> 08:54.533
I'm selling it.

08:56.567 --> 09:01.500
(soft music playing)

09:01.567 --> 09:04.100
We cannot go on

09:04.166 --> 09:06.367
with Blanche and Rose
not speaking to each other.

09:06.433 --> 09:08.633
Whatever the results
of the secret ballot,

09:08.700 --> 09:09.734
we go with it.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.633
No more arguments, agreed?

09:12.700 --> 09:14.033
All right.

09:14.100 --> 09:15.266
Ok. Here we go.

09:15.333 --> 09:17.834
"Split the money."

09:17.900 --> 09:19.567
"Let Blanche keep it."

09:21.200 --> 09:22.333
"Give it to the old lady."

09:22.400 --> 09:24.066
Yes!

09:25.900 --> 09:27.700
"Split the money."

09:27.767 --> 09:30.300
Well, Blanche,
it looks like the splits have it.

09:30.367 --> 09:31.433
Big daddy was right.

09:31.500 --> 09:34.266
Women shouldn't
be allowed to vote.

09:34.333 --> 09:35.633
If it's any consolation,

09:35.700 --> 09:37.867
when I wrote down,
"Give it to the old lady,"

09:37.934 --> 09:39.867
I did mean you.

09:39.934 --> 09:41.867
(doorbell rings)

09:44.533 --> 09:47.000
-Hi, it's me, Stan.
-Hi, Stan. Come on in.

09:47.066 --> 09:49.867
How nice of you to stop by.

09:49.934 --> 09:51.500
-Bring me anything?
-Of course.

09:51.567 --> 09:53.633
Who's my gorgeous,
gray-haired gal?

09:53.700 --> 09:54.900
It's me, isn't it, Stan?

09:54.967 --> 09:56.834
You're right.

09:56.900 --> 09:59.033
Wow, a game boy!

09:59.100 --> 10:01.133
Very nice!

10:01.200 --> 10:03.667
It sure is.
Now, who's your favorite fella?

10:03.734 --> 10:05.734
Sophia, who's your favorite,
Sophia?

10:05.800 --> 10:07.133
Yeah, later.

10:08.300 --> 10:10.600
Stanley,
I want to talk about these gifts.

10:10.667 --> 10:11.433
No need, babe.

10:11.500 --> 10:14.033
Did you think the stickman
could hit the jackpot

10:14.100 --> 10:17.033
and not share
with his best used-to-be?

10:17.100 --> 10:18.467
Let me show you something.

10:18.533 --> 10:19.767
Come on.

10:21.066 --> 10:22.967
<i>Pour vous, mon ex.</i>

10:23.033 --> 10:24.934
-Ooh!
-Oh, a new convertible.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.333
Oh, it's gorgeous.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.266
Stan, I'm not driving around

10:28.333 --> 10:30.967
with license plates that say,
"pothead."

10:33.600 --> 10:34.667
It's an abbreviation.

10:34.734 --> 10:37.033
I didn't have room
for the whole "potato head."

10:37.533 --> 10:39.033
I don't want your car.

10:39.100 --> 10:40.033
I don't want your money.

10:40.100 --> 10:42.166
I don't even want to talk to you,

10:42.233 --> 10:44.467
much less go to
that ridiculous reception.

10:44.533 --> 10:47.066
So take a hint and go away.

10:48.500 --> 10:50.000
Just a minute, Dorothy.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.633
I'm sick and tired of being dumped
on by you.

10:52.700 --> 10:55.467
Yes, I screwed up our marriage.

10:55.533 --> 10:57.066
I wasn't a yutz for all those years.

10:57.133 --> 10:59.433
There were some good times
before things went wrong.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.367
Until I found out about them.

11:03.033 --> 11:05.767
Old news.
This time I came up a winner.

11:05.834 --> 11:06.700
Things have changed.

11:06.767 --> 11:09.133
Stan, I'm her legal guardian.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.100
We'll take the car.

11:11.166 --> 11:12.567
Stanley, you'd better leave.

11:12.633 --> 11:14.400
I thought I could make up
for some mistakes,

11:14.467 --> 11:16.200
but you won't let me.

11:16.266 --> 11:19.767
You have an image
of what Stan Zbornak is.

11:19.834 --> 11:21.934
You will never see a new man.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.333
Don't worry.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.734
I won't bother you
with gifts anymore.

11:25.800 --> 11:28.667
In fact, I won't bother you at all.

11:32.834 --> 11:34.567
Hey, Stan, could I be pothead?

11:40.667 --> 11:45.333
(calm music playing)

11:46.600 --> 11:47.600
Did you call St. Olaf?

11:47.667 --> 11:49.467
How do we cash the bonds?

11:49.533 --> 11:52.667
I won't beat around the bush.

11:52.734 --> 11:55.200
There was an ant
and a grasshopper--

11:55.266 --> 11:57.934
Oh, my God!

11:58.000 --> 11:59.266
They're not going
to redeem the bonds?

11:59.333 --> 12:00.900
Oh, they want to,

12:00.967 --> 12:03.600
but the city would have
to liquidate all its assets.

12:03.667 --> 12:05.633
St. Olaf would be bankrupt.

12:05.700 --> 12:07.500
And this affects me how?

12:09.100 --> 12:10.467
Don't you understand?

12:10.533 --> 12:11.867
If we take that money,

12:11.934 --> 12:14.166
there won't be any left
for the police cars,

12:14.233 --> 12:17.433
the fire trucks,
the children's cheese museum.

12:20.967 --> 12:25.100
You have a museum
where children go to look at cheese?

12:25.166 --> 12:29.033
Hey, it beats learning about it
in the streets.

12:30.266 --> 12:32.400
Oh, Sophia, no bingo tonight?

12:32.467 --> 12:35.633
I'm staying home to try
and recapture my lost youth.

12:35.700 --> 12:37.266
I see you haven't got it.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.600
Today I saw something that shook up
everything I ever believed in,

12:43.667 --> 12:46.200
Stan Zbornak with a backbone.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.300
It really was a surprise.

12:48.367 --> 12:50.200
It's Dorothy who has me worried.

12:50.266 --> 12:52.133
She just looked so confused.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.734
I can't figure out her problem.

12:53.800 --> 12:56.767
I'm having a little trouble
with that myself.

12:56.834 --> 13:00.433
Pussycat, what's so terrible about
accepting a present from Stan?

13:00.500 --> 13:02.467
God knows he gave us
plenty of misery.

13:02.533 --> 13:04.533
Maybe he's trying to tell you
he's sorry.

13:04.600 --> 13:08.834
I have to admit
Stan was pretty amazing today.

13:08.900 --> 13:12.100
Did you see the way
he stood up for himself?

13:12.166 --> 13:14.000
This is not the same guy
who screamed,

13:14.066 --> 13:17.166
"Paint my toenails!
We've just invaded Korea!"

13:22.233 --> 13:25.100
It was kind of attractive.

13:25.166 --> 13:27.967
Oh, but I don't know,
it's so hard to trust him.

13:28.033 --> 13:30.834
I know what it's like to trust
someone who's betrayed you.

13:30.900 --> 13:32.266
You're not going to believe this,

13:32.333 --> 13:36.033
but I have a St. Olaf story
about this.

13:36.100 --> 13:38.867
I believe you.
I just hate you.

13:40.367 --> 13:44.834
Well, Gunilla Bjorndunker,
St. Olaf's tallest woman,

13:44.900 --> 13:47.967
of course, nobody ever
made fun of her for that.

13:48.033 --> 13:51.533
Anyway, when old space needle
was in high school...

13:53.734 --> 13:56.367
she drank some cherry herring

13:56.433 --> 14:01.400
and made love in the back seat
of a Fjord Fjairlane...

14:03.066 --> 14:04.000
local car.

14:04.066 --> 14:06.200
Ahh.

14:06.266 --> 14:11.066
And she got in trouble,
if you know what I mean, Dorothy.

14:11.133 --> 14:13.066
(speaking in foreign language)

14:15.300 --> 14:18.033
She knows what you mean.

14:18.533 --> 14:21.900
Anyway,
her boyfriend Yutz Hernsberg,

14:21.967 --> 14:26.767
St. Olaf's only bald high school
student, had to marry her.

14:26.834 --> 14:28.934
Why would she marry him?

14:29.000 --> 14:31.033
Because I was young!

14:35.500 --> 14:38.800
I'm sorry, Rose.
This is your story.

14:38.867 --> 14:40.367
Go on. Go on.

14:40.433 --> 14:44.834
After 38 years of marriage
and a painful divorce,

14:44.900 --> 14:49.400
he finally came back, having
invented Hernsberg press-on warts.

14:51.967 --> 14:53.734
Who bought those?

14:53.800 --> 14:55.667
Hags, mostly.

14:58.066 --> 15:01.900
Don't you see? He was successful
and wanted Gunilla back.

15:03.066 --> 15:05.200
Well, what happened to her, Rose?

15:05.266 --> 15:07.200
Skylab fell on her.

15:09.667 --> 15:13.133
What is the point of this story?

15:13.200 --> 15:15.633
Be thankful for your health.

15:18.100 --> 15:21.266
(serene music playing)

15:21.333 --> 15:24.100
This whole St. Olaf
problem is my fault.

15:24.166 --> 15:26.867
I can't believe
I forgot those bonds.

15:26.934 --> 15:28.900
How could I be so stupid?

15:28.967 --> 15:33.266
Maybe it was something you ate,
like food.

15:34.800 --> 15:37.900
Oh, come on, honey. You're getting
worked up over nothing.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.200
Blanche is petty and selfish,

15:40.266 --> 15:44.233
but I don't think she would actually
bankrupt a whole town.

15:44.300 --> 15:46.133
God, I look good in diamonds.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.500
Say hello to
my four new best friends.

15:49.567 --> 15:50.967
Hello.

15:51.033 --> 15:54.467
They're just on loan until
I decide which one I want to keep.

15:54.533 --> 15:57.333
The good thing about me
is although I'm petite,

15:57.400 --> 15:59.567
I can carry a large stone.

16:01.333 --> 16:04.133
Don't you even care about
these people at all?

16:04.200 --> 16:05.667
Of course, I do.

16:05.734 --> 16:08.700
But look how
these catch the light.

16:08.767 --> 16:10.967
I wish I knew the right thing to do.

16:11.033 --> 16:14.467
Sit down and think about
the pros and cons.

16:14.533 --> 16:17.133
Whenever I don't know what to do,
I make a list.

16:17.200 --> 16:20.734
Making a pro and con list
is a wonderful idea.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.266
It'll help you know
the right thing to do.

16:23.333 --> 16:27.533
Let's see, pro, cashing the bonds,
I get stuff.

16:27.600 --> 16:31.867
Con, St. Olaf, a small town,
faces financial ruin.

16:31.934 --> 16:34.500
Well, that doesn't help
clear anything up.

16:34.567 --> 16:37.734
Wait a minute, Blanche.
There's another con.

16:37.800 --> 16:39.467
This is wrong.

16:39.533 --> 16:40.934
Come on, we're family.

16:41.033 --> 16:42.266
We always stick together.

16:42.333 --> 16:44.400
We may not
always get along,

16:44.467 --> 16:47.767
but we've always been there
when we've needed each other.

16:47.834 --> 16:50.033
This is important to Rose,

16:50.100 --> 16:53.533
and I think we need
to stand behind her.

16:53.600 --> 16:57.934
I mean, you're taking away
a part of her home.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.033
Granted, it's the cradle of idiocy.

17:03.633 --> 17:06.033
I have a frog buried there.

17:07.734 --> 17:09.767
All right. All right.

17:09.834 --> 17:11.800
The bonds are in
my safety deposit box.

17:11.867 --> 17:13.100
I'll give them to you this
afternoon.

17:13.166 --> 17:16.100
Oh, Blanche, thank you.

17:16.166 --> 17:18.200
On behalf
of the people of St. Olaf,

17:18.266 --> 17:20.800
I'd like to do a thank-you dance.

17:20.867 --> 17:24.734
I'll need a pot, a sheet,
a rubber band, and a spoon.

17:25.734 --> 17:27.266
Making a drum?

17:27.767 --> 17:29.467
I guess you could.

17:33.333 --> 17:34.600
Milk or lemon?

17:34.667 --> 17:35.867
Scotch.

17:37.166 --> 17:38.567
Forget it, Ma.

17:38.633 --> 17:40.333
What are you saving me for?

17:44.066 --> 17:47.934
Ok, Rose, here they are.
Here are the bonds.

17:48.033 --> 17:49.400
And, Dorothy, I want to thank you

17:49.467 --> 17:53.166
for helping me buy $25,000
worth of piece of mind.

17:53.233 --> 17:54.834
Oh, Blanche,
thank you.

17:54.900 --> 17:58.500
I just got off the phone
with the city fathers of St. Olaf.

17:58.567 --> 18:00.633
It's been unanimously decided

18:00.700 --> 18:03.533
they are going to build
a statue to Blanche Deveraux

18:03.600 --> 18:05.967
right in the middle
of Mrs. Olsen square.

18:06.033 --> 18:08.900
A statue? Oh, my.

18:08.967 --> 18:09.867
Is it going to be a big one?

18:09.934 --> 18:14.000
St. Olaf license plates don't say
big statue country for nothing.

18:14.066 --> 18:16.066
Oh!

18:16.133 --> 18:17.800
Well, all right. That does it.

18:17.867 --> 18:20.133
You're all my witnesses.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.967
-Ooh!
-Speech! Speech!

18:23.033 --> 18:24.767
Wait, wait a minute.

18:24.834 --> 18:25.934
Wait a minute.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.033
If St. Olaf is flat broke,

18:28.100 --> 18:30.066
how are they going
to pay for this statue?

18:30.133 --> 18:34.266
Every penny comes out of the
$500,000 emergency statue fund.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.200
$500,000?

18:41.266 --> 18:45.166
You can't touch that fund
unless it's a real statue emergency.

18:45.233 --> 18:47.033
(doorbell rings)

18:47.100 --> 18:50.834
I'm sorry, Blanche. I've given
you some really bad advice here.

18:55.934 --> 19:00.100
If you're here to beg me to go
to that reception, forget it.

19:00.166 --> 19:03.500
Hey, Stanley Zbornak
does not beg, ok?

19:03.567 --> 19:05.834
I have my self-respect,
my dignity.

19:05.900 --> 19:07.100
Then why are you here?

19:07.166 --> 19:09.700
I need you to tie my tie.

19:09.767 --> 19:11.567
Come on, Stanley.

19:11.633 --> 19:13.266
I don't know how to do it, ok?

19:13.333 --> 19:14.700
The Japanese will be insulted

19:14.767 --> 19:18.233
if they think I already did
my Sinatra impression.

19:18.300 --> 19:20.000
Are you going to help me or not?

19:23.467 --> 19:26.700
This reminds me of
the first time I ever did this,

19:26.767 --> 19:28.100
the night of our senior prom.

19:28.166 --> 19:30.333
Yeah, remember?

19:30.400 --> 19:32.200
It took so long
to get the tie fixed,

19:32.266 --> 19:34.600
by the time we got to the drugstore
it was closed.

19:41.867 --> 19:43.800
I remember.

19:43.867 --> 19:45.500
Aah, Dorothy!

19:46.867 --> 19:48.734
Remember our wedding day?

19:48.800 --> 19:51.133
I made you do this even though
you thought it would be bad luck

19:51.200 --> 19:53.233
for me to see you
before the ceremony.

19:53.300 --> 19:57.100
What a silly superstition.

19:57.166 --> 19:59.433
You know, Dorothy,
all those years of marriage,

19:59.500 --> 20:00.700
through all the struggles,

20:00.767 --> 20:03.467
the one thing I wanted
was to be a success.

20:03.533 --> 20:07.567
Suddenly I have all the success,
and it scares me.

20:07.633 --> 20:09.233
I keep waiting
for a knock at the door.

20:09.300 --> 20:11.834
"Hi, it's me, failure."

20:11.900 --> 20:14.600
I'm scared to face it alone.

20:14.667 --> 20:17.000
What I'm trying to say is,
I need your help,

20:17.066 --> 20:18.967
like when we were together.

20:22.066 --> 20:24.567
So, what do you think?

20:24.633 --> 20:27.667
I hate to admit it,
but you look good.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.867
Well, wish me luck.

20:33.834 --> 20:37.233
Stanley, why don't you come
back here in about an hour.

20:37.300 --> 20:38.100
Why?

20:38.166 --> 20:40.000
I'll need to get ready.

20:40.066 --> 20:42.066
Oh, thank you, Dorothy.

20:42.133 --> 20:45.500
Besides, I'll need someone
to fasten my pearls.

20:45.567 --> 20:47.533
Ah, babe.
The ones I gave you?

20:47.600 --> 20:50.533
No, sweetheart, the real ones.

20:54.967 --> 20:58.500
(mellow music playing)

21:03.500 --> 21:05.300
Explain it to me again, Blanche.

21:05.367 --> 21:08.567
Rose, look. If there's
$500,000 in the statue fund.

21:08.633 --> 21:12.266
Why can't they just take 50,000
of it to save the town?

21:12.333 --> 21:14.433
Because that's the statue money.

21:14.500 --> 21:16.667
Well, there won't be anywhere
to put the statue

21:16.734 --> 21:18.033
if there's no town left.

21:18.100 --> 21:20.967
Wow, a loophole.

21:22.767 --> 21:25.433
Hi, it's me, Dorothy and Stan.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.900
Hi, how did it go?

21:26.967 --> 21:28.567
It was great.

21:28.633 --> 21:31.133
Those Japanese sure
know how to have fun.

21:31.200 --> 21:33.333
What was that crazy dance
called again?

21:33.400 --> 21:35.233
They were bowing, Stanley.

21:36.734 --> 21:39.200
Wild, they were just wild.

21:39.266 --> 21:40.734
They loved you, Dorothy.

21:40.800 --> 21:45.734
No, they loved you,
except for those Hirohito jokes.

21:45.800 --> 21:47.400
Too soon?

21:48.734 --> 21:53.667
Rose, we could call St. Olaf,
and you could explain it to them.

21:53.734 --> 21:54.934
We could try.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.033
We might not get ahold of anybody.

21:57.100 --> 21:59.000
It's "everybody hide the corn" day.

22:02.266 --> 22:03.633
It was a perfect reception.

22:03.700 --> 22:05.567
For once, everything was perfect.

22:05.633 --> 22:07.700
It was you, babe.
You charmed them.

22:07.767 --> 22:09.800
You were pretty
impressive yourself.

22:09.867 --> 22:12.100
You gave them
a respectable soft sell,

22:12.166 --> 22:15.867
and you made a deal that's going
to profit both sides.

22:15.934 --> 22:18.533
You've come a long way,
Zbornee.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.166
Thanks, babe.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.567
Well, I'd better be going.

22:23.633 --> 22:25.500
It was a good evening.

22:25.567 --> 22:29.033
Zbornak and Zbornak,
what a team.

22:29.100 --> 22:31.233
Maybe we can do it again
sometime.

22:33.166 --> 22:34.433
Maybe.

22:34.500 --> 22:37.233
Thanks, babe, Dorothy.

23:02.700 --> 23:06.033
Dorothy, you're going to send me
to an early grave.

23:08.467 --> 23:11.300
Too late, Ma.
Good night.

23:18.767 --> 23:21.700
(theme music playing)
