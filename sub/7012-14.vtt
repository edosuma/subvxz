00:03.803 --> 00:06.966
Hey, guys?
I'm thinking about getting a perm.

00:09.242 --> 00:11.642
Hyde, can I get
the number of your guy?

00:12.912 --> 00:15.779
I don't have a ''guy,'' dumb-ass.

00:15.849 --> 00:19.216
This righteous moss
is a gift from God.

00:19.285 --> 00:22.846
God gave me a perm, too,
but he hit me below the belt.

00:28.294 --> 00:30.228
What are you doing, Forman?

00:30.296 --> 00:32.787
My stupid Cousin Penny from Florida
is coming this weekend...

00:32.866 --> 00:35.130
so my mom's making me
clean the basement.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.701
And I'm done.

00:45.779 --> 00:49.510
- Penny?
- God, she was always such a tattletale.

00:49.582 --> 00:51.914
''Eric's stealing cookies.''
''Eric's playing with fire.''

00:51.985 --> 00:54.579
''Eric's touching himself.''

00:55.889 --> 00:59.723
Yeah, but Eric got her back.

00:59.793 --> 01:03.126
He hit her with the old Ben Gay
on the toothbrush...

01:03.196 --> 01:05.687
and the over-the-shoulder wedgie...

01:05.765 --> 01:08.290
and the butt-face gas attack.

01:08.368 --> 01:11.064
- Butt-face gas attack?
- I'll show you later.

01:11.137 --> 01:13.332
Thank you.

01:13.406 --> 01:18.434
My favorite was when you trapped her in the
revolving door at the library and kept spinning her.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.847
Yeah, she ralphed...

01:21.915 --> 01:24.679
and then she had to keep
walking through the puddle.

01:25.885 --> 01:28.945
'Cause it's a revolving door.
( Chuckles )

01:29.022 --> 01:32.116
It spins in circles.

01:32.192 --> 01:34.626
That's its nature.
It just-

01:38.431 --> 01:40.422
<i>Hangin'out</i>

01:41.668 --> 01:43.659
<i>Down the street</i>

01:45.472 --> 01:47.463
<i>The same old thing</i>

01:49.242 --> 01:51.233
<i>We did last week</i>

01:52.445 --> 01:56.040
<i>Not a thing to do</i>

01:57.050 --> 02:00.451
<i>But talk to you</i>

02:00.520 --> 02:02.249
<i>We're all all right</i>

02:02.322 --> 02:04.187
<i>We're all all right</i>

02:04.257 --> 02:07.192
<i>Hello, Wisconsin.!</i>

02:15.101 --> 02:17.092
- Penny!
- Aunt Kitty!

02:18.738 --> 02:23.607
- It's so good to see you!
- Oh, my gosh, you have grown so-

02:23.676 --> 02:25.610
Things have-

02:25.678 --> 02:28.044
Good for you!

02:28.114 --> 02:31.572
And good for us.

02:31.651 --> 02:34.518
Oh, geez.

02:35.555 --> 02:37.546
Penny.

02:39.425 --> 02:42.826
You're so... shiny.

02:45.899 --> 02:48.197
I am just so excited you're here.

02:48.268 --> 02:52.500
I have lots of free time these days,
so I've gathered up some local foliage.

02:52.572 --> 02:57.202
And I thought we could have a long talk
while we make our own potpourri!

02:57.277 --> 02:59.575
( Laughing )

02:59.646 --> 03:04.345
Well, thanks, Aunt Kitty, but right now
I'd just like to catch up with Eric.

03:04.417 --> 03:07.079
Find out how he got so foxy.

03:08.755 --> 03:12.919
Okay, you boys be nice.
But not too nice.

03:14.994 --> 03:18.452
Penny, I know your last trip
here I was kind of a jerk, and-

03:18.531 --> 03:21.500
Oh, God, Eric!
That was so long ago.

03:21.568 --> 03:25.937
Plus, I can't stay mad at you.
You're too cute. ( Chuckles )

03:27.640 --> 03:30.131
( Laughing )

03:30.210 --> 03:35.238
- Hey, guys, what's up?
- Oh, hey, you remember my Cousin Penny?

03:35.315 --> 03:39.046
Hey, Penny. I didn't recognize you
without Eric's butt in your face.

03:44.090 --> 03:48.220
So, you guys ready for the movies?
You can come too.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.493
I guess.

03:51.564 --> 03:54.465
Thanks, but this Wisconsin air
is so dry...

03:54.534 --> 03:57.332
I really should go inside
and moisturize before I lose my tan.

04:02.508 --> 04:04.806
I have lotion.

04:04.877 --> 04:09.075
I think the best plan is for all of us
to go to the movies-

04:09.148 --> 04:12.811
except for me and Penny,
who will stay here and moisturize each other.

04:14.320 --> 04:17.255
What? Screw that,
I'm gonna moisturize too.

04:18.558 --> 04:22.619
- Michael!
- I'll just do, like, a leg or something.

04:23.630 --> 04:25.564
Fine!

04:25.632 --> 04:27.827
Come on.
Let me show you to your room.

04:28.868 --> 04:31.996
- Michael!
- I'm gettin' Kool-Aid!

04:32.071 --> 04:34.062
Damn!

04:36.743 --> 04:39.769
What losers!
Did you see them checking her out?

04:39.846 --> 04:43.612
- Okay, she's not that hot.
- I never liked her.

04:43.683 --> 04:46.379
You know, once when we were little
she bit me, so I bit her back.

04:46.452 --> 04:48.579
And then she said, ''Truce,''
so I said, ''Okay.''

04:48.655 --> 04:51.055
And then she bit me again.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.115
( Scoffs )
Whore.

04:53.192 --> 04:56.559
Slut.

04:56.629 --> 05:01.032
- No, her.
- Oh, yeah.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.034
Whore.

05:06.105 --> 05:09.541
Yeah, we'll show Penny
with our new sunlamp tans.

05:11.411 --> 05:16.474
How dare she come into our town
and try to ''out-hot'' us.

05:16.549 --> 05:20.918
I know. I mean, we don't go to her town
and try and ''out-whore'' her.

05:24.223 --> 05:28.023
Well, she can't just show up all hot,
shaking her butt around our guys.

05:28.094 --> 05:32.030
If our guys are gonna fantasize about
moisturizing anybody, it should be us.

05:34.634 --> 05:37.694
Right. But we're not gonna
let them do that, are we?

05:37.770 --> 05:40.534
Let's just hope
it doesn't come to that.

05:44.210 --> 05:47.236
Have you seen that little stray cat
that's been hanging around our house?

05:47.313 --> 05:50.009
Oh, yeah, I met him this morning.

05:51.718 --> 05:53.709
Then he met the hose.

05:55.488 --> 05:59.720
Kitty, we don't need more things
hanging around our house.

05:59.792 --> 06:02.260
We already have Steven and Kelso...

06:02.328 --> 06:05.991
and ''foreign kid.''

06:09.001 --> 06:12.437
Yeah, but they're always busy.

06:12.505 --> 06:16.601
Maybe I should get my own cat.
I'm not working. I'm home all day.

06:19.011 --> 06:21.775
Here's my problem with cats.

06:21.848 --> 06:26.979
Best-case scenario: You get the smartest cat
in the world. He still craps in your house.

06:31.758 --> 06:35.216
Well, it's just, it would be nice
to have something to take care of.

06:35.294 --> 06:37.785
I'll tell you what, Kitty.

06:37.864 --> 06:41.595
Instead of getting a cat,
why don't we all just stop flushing?

06:47.006 --> 06:49.236
It's the same thing!

06:52.845 --> 06:56.645
Guys, I'm getting some weirdness
from Cousin Penny.

06:56.716 --> 07:00.277
Earlier, she gave me a hug,
but this wasn't a cousin hug.

07:02.021 --> 07:05.047
Our middles touched.

07:05.124 --> 07:09.220
And not just for a second.
She pressed.

07:11.531 --> 07:16.195
I've heard of''kissing cousins.''
But have you ever heard of''doin' it cousins''?

07:16.269 --> 07:19.636
'Cause that's what I think
Forman should be shooting for here.

07:19.705 --> 07:24.768
Kelso, I appreciate the advice, but your
solution to every problem is ''do it with her.''

07:27.413 --> 07:29.711
Well, it worked with
my old science teacher.

07:29.782 --> 07:31.773
C-minus!

07:35.254 --> 07:39.020
Well, unfortunately,
Penny is my cousin.

07:39.091 --> 07:44.256
That'd be like looking at my mom and thinking,
''Hey, baby, how''- I'm just gonna stop right there.

07:48.334 --> 07:52.270
I've thought that about your mom,
but I didn't stop right there.

07:52.338 --> 07:54.272
( Groans )

08:00.813 --> 08:03.304
Surprise!

08:03.382 --> 08:06.146
This oughta keep you
company during the week.

08:06.219 --> 08:10.315
Roy's Pet Store?
Red, you got me a cat!

08:10.389 --> 08:13.916
- Well, it's like a cat.
- ( Giggling )

08:18.998 --> 08:20.932
A fish?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.991
Red, it's a fish.

08:23.069 --> 08:25.936
See?
It's like a cat.

08:27.139 --> 08:31.007
- They're both pets.
- No, they're not.

08:31.077 --> 08:34.342
Pets are called ''pets''
because you pet them.

08:35.748 --> 08:37.682
How do I pet this thing?

08:37.750 --> 08:42.210
Well, you just reach in
and corner it and give it a rub.

08:45.191 --> 08:49.890
That's the thing about fish:
They just love the feel of the human hand.

( Gasps )
Jackie!Jackie, wake up.

09:16.989 --> 09:20.083
Oh, my God.
Donna, you're totally burned.

09:20.159 --> 09:23.026
Really?

09:24.063 --> 09:26.964
( Gasps )
What have you done to me?

09:27.033 --> 09:30.093
Me?
This was your stupid idea.

09:30.169 --> 09:32.729
Did you call me ''stupid''?

09:34.307 --> 09:37.037
- Ow!
- Ow!

09:37.109 --> 09:39.339
- Lobster face!
- Ow!

09:39.412 --> 09:41.937
Little Red Riding Bitch!

09:42.014 --> 09:44.141
( Screams )
Oh, my God!

09:44.216 --> 09:47.845
Okay! Now, okay,
let's just call a truce.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.252
Fine.

09:50.323 --> 09:52.257
- Ow!
- Ow!

09:52.325 --> 09:54.259
- ( Squeals )
- Ow!

09:56.195 --> 09:58.789
Don't look at me.
Mrs. Paul killed these.

10:01.834 --> 10:04.268
Here.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.464
So...

10:06.539 --> 10:09.633
must get pretty boring
living in a fishbowl, huh?

10:10.676 --> 10:14.112
Gets pretty boring around here too.

10:14.180 --> 10:19.015
You know, I used to work at a hospital,
and taking care of people-

10:19.085 --> 10:23.613
( Chuckling )
It felt so good to be needed.

10:23.689 --> 10:26.089
<i>You know,</i>
<i>like-like part of a team?</i>

10:26.158 --> 10:31.027
( Gurgling ) You know, people really
depended on me, which I kind of miss.

10:31.097 --> 10:33.998
Oh, at least I don't-
I don't miss the bedpans.

10:34.066 --> 10:36.227
( Laughing )

10:46.646 --> 10:50.742
Are you sure it's okay
for me to do my yoga in here?

10:50.816 --> 10:54.912
Do Aunt Kitty and Uncle Red
allow girls in your room?

10:54.987 --> 10:58.616
Well, you're my cousin,
so you don't even really count as a girl.

11:00.393 --> 11:03.988
You're like a rock.
( Chuckles )

11:04.063 --> 11:08.227
A moving, talking,
extremely limber rock.

11:10.703 --> 11:14.696
( Sighs )
Ooh, that's nice.

11:19.278 --> 11:21.610
- Peterson's Auto Shop.
- What?

11:21.681 --> 11:25.208
Peterson's Auto Shop.
That's what my T-shirt says.

11:25.284 --> 11:27.844
I noticed you were trying to read it.

11:32.291 --> 11:35.692
That's-Yes.
Yes, I was.

11:35.761 --> 11:40.562
I, uh- I kinda have, like,
a passion for T-shirt logos.

11:40.633 --> 11:43.431
( Giggles )

11:43.502 --> 11:46.096
Okay, well, bedtime for
this logo fan, okay?

11:48.808 --> 11:50.799
( Voice Cracking )
Off you go.

11:54.647 --> 11:56.581
Uh-oh.

11:57.917 --> 11:59.908
Naughty thoughts a-brewin'.

11:59.985 --> 12:02.613
<i>( Banjo:Bluegrass )</i>

12:27.978 --> 12:31.243
Penny, you're cold.

12:31.315 --> 12:33.306
Go get a sweatshirt.

12:34.618 --> 12:36.643
Oh. Okay, Uncle Red.

12:41.759 --> 12:47.425
<i>Eric, do I have to tell you</i>
<i>to stop staring at your cousin?</i>

12:49.433 --> 12:52.334
Stop staring at your cousin.

12:52.403 --> 12:54.701
<i>Kitty, where's breakfast?</i>

12:54.772 --> 12:59.038
Honey, I'm-I'm running a little late.

12:59.109 --> 13:03.546
I was, um, redecorating Fluffy's bowl.
( Laughs )

13:03.614 --> 13:06.082
Kitty, it's a stupid fish.

13:06.150 --> 13:10.052
- What?
- ( Groans )

13:11.355 --> 13:13.346
Cinnamon toast, get on it!

13:20.597 --> 13:24.328
Oh, so, decided against the sweatshirt.
( Chuckles )

13:24.401 --> 13:26.892
- It's a bold choice.
- ( Chuckling )

13:26.970 --> 13:31.339
I saw Uncle Red leaving,
and I wanted to talk to you alone.

13:31.408 --> 13:34.707
See, I kind of have a crush on you.

13:37.414 --> 13:40.144
Okay, Penny, okay.

13:40.217 --> 13:42.151
( Inhales Sharply )

13:42.219 --> 13:45.985
Look, I don't know what
the laws are down in...

13:46.056 --> 13:47.990
Florida.

13:48.058 --> 13:52.085
But up here, the cousin-lovin'
is really frowned upon.

13:53.397 --> 13:55.797
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

13:55.866 --> 14:00.132
Last week, I overheard my parents talking,
and I found out that I'm adopted.

14:02.873 --> 14:05.671
So, technically,
we're not even related.

14:09.313 --> 14:11.304
Well, that's a twist.

14:12.950 --> 14:16.408
And all those feelings that I had about you
that would've been wrong?

14:16.487 --> 14:19.285
Are pretty freakin' right!

14:21.191 --> 14:24.126
- Bring it in.
- ( Sighs )

14:25.796 --> 14:28.424
Now you're warm...

14:28.499 --> 14:30.694
and I don't feel bad about that.

14:41.245 --> 14:43.577
( Grunts )
So Penny's not even your cousin?

14:43.647 --> 14:47.606
All right. Well, in light of recent developments,
I vote ''do it.''

14:49.219 --> 14:51.813
Do it, yellow belly!

14:51.889 --> 14:54.357
Look, man, if you don't do it...

14:54.424 --> 14:56.688
I'm gonna do it.

14:56.760 --> 14:58.955
Then I'm gonna make fun of you.

14:59.029 --> 15:01.793
All right, fellas.
I guess it's all systems go.

15:01.865 --> 15:04.095
Just- Hey, let's keep
this between us, okay?

15:04.168 --> 15:06.432
- Hey, what's up?
- <i>( Ball Hits Backboard )</i>

15:06.503 --> 15:08.835
- Forman wants to nail his cousin.
- No.

15:08.906 --> 15:12.171
No, no, no, she's not my cousin.
She was adopted.

15:12.242 --> 15:14.972
And what the hell
happened to your face?

15:15.045 --> 15:19.641
- What the hell happened to yours?
- ( Mock Gasp ) Burn!

15:21.518 --> 15:23.509
Yeah, I gotta admit, Donna,
that was a nice burn.

15:23.587 --> 15:26.784
And I don't mean what you said just there.
I mean your face. Nice burn.

15:26.857 --> 15:31.590
Hey, if you ever need a date for prom,
you can just flip through the family album.

15:31.662 --> 15:34.290
- ( Groans )
- Oh, God.

15:34.364 --> 15:36.855
You're just jealous
because Penny is incredibly hot...

15:36.934 --> 15:39.459
and you're a throbbing red pile.

15:42.039 --> 15:46.499
Eric, my sunburn will fade,
but your shame will last forever.

15:49.613 --> 15:53.879
Yeah, well, at least my shame won't... peel.
( Laughs )

16:02.292 --> 16:04.283
Hey, there's my girl.

16:06.563 --> 16:08.997
New logo. Nice.

16:09.066 --> 16:11.864
I was just having
a glass of milk before bed.

16:11.935 --> 16:13.869
Oh, well, you know,
you don't have to rush off.

16:13.937 --> 16:17.065
Sit. Come on.
Let's gab awhile.

16:20.143 --> 16:22.543
- ( Sighs )
- So...

16:22.613 --> 16:25.411
let's get to the bottom
of this crush, huh?

16:25.482 --> 16:27.643
You know what
I'd really love to do?

16:27.718 --> 16:30.846
Stay up late and watch movies
like we did when we were kids.

16:30.921 --> 16:33.583
Remember?
All alone in the dark?

16:37.027 --> 16:39.552
That's a good plan.

16:39.630 --> 16:43.361
- And let's wear our jammies!
- Excellent addition to the plan.

16:44.768 --> 16:48.704
Oh, but I usually just sleep
in a T-shirt and panties.

16:48.772 --> 16:50.763
Is that okay?

16:53.410 --> 16:57.403
Well, so do I!
( Laughs )

16:58.715 --> 17:01.741
Er, I mean, you know, man-panties- Er-

17:03.954 --> 17:05.922
Underwear.
( Chuckles )

17:05.989 --> 17:09.356
- You know what I meant.
- Great. The movie starts at 1 1 :00.

17:09.425 --> 17:12.054
- Don't be late.
- Okay, I won't.

17:15.464 --> 17:17.797
''Man-panties''?

17:20.737 --> 17:23.467
- Kitty? What happened?
- Fluffy died.

17:26.977 --> 17:31.880
Well, if it's any consolation,
fish are never even really alive.

17:33.183 --> 17:35.174
They're just less dead.

17:36.286 --> 17:38.720
I know.

17:38.789 --> 17:41.815
You know, he wasn't good company,
but at least he was company.

17:41.892 --> 17:43.883
- ( Sighs )
- Red, I'm unhappy.

17:43.960 --> 17:46.190
Oh! I gotta go to the store.

17:47.731 --> 17:49.892
I am a nurturer.

17:49.966 --> 17:54.801
I am not gonna be satisfied nurturing
something you'd win at a carnival.

17:54.871 --> 17:58.204
Kitty, what do you want?
I'll get you anything you want.

17:58.275 --> 18:00.743
Not a cat.

18:00.811 --> 18:05.214
- I want to go back to the hospital to work.
- Oh.

18:05.282 --> 18:09.013
As long as it's not a cat, I'm good.

18:12.589 --> 18:17.754
Okay, I think what you mean is,
''I'm glad you're doing what makes you happy.''

18:17.828 --> 18:20.353
Oh, of course.

18:22.265 --> 18:25.359
And I'm sorry that your fish died.

18:25.435 --> 18:28.029
Don't be.
I flushed it.

18:46.223 --> 18:48.384
Good evening, milady.

18:51.461 --> 18:54.259
1 1 :00, on the nose.

18:54.331 --> 18:56.526
Well, we're all alone.

18:56.600 --> 19:01.264
I told Hyde to amscray for a while.
So go ahead, take off your robe.

19:17.954 --> 19:20.548
Penny, there's no rat-

19:22.826 --> 19:25.317
Don't, Eric! Don't!

19:25.395 --> 19:29.354
- No, I was-
- Eric, step away from your cousin.

19:30.734 --> 19:32.895
No, she's not my cousin.
She was adopted.

19:32.969 --> 19:38.566
- I'm not adopted.
- Wh-What? What? She's lying!

19:40.243 --> 19:44.077
Eric, I saw her mother
give birth to her.

19:45.115 --> 19:47.242
Now, what is going on?

19:47.317 --> 19:50.775
I'm... sleepwalking?

19:54.124 --> 19:57.184
And I'm about to be
''sleepkicking'' your ass.

20:01.765 --> 20:06.498
Eric, what kind of person would lie about
something as serious as being adopted?

20:09.873 --> 20:14.367
A liar who specializes in adoption lies:
You. A mean, vindictive person.

20:14.444 --> 20:18.437
- Like someone who would trap
someone in a revolving door?
- Yes! Ohh.

20:24.855 --> 20:28.723
Mom, Dad, can- can Penny and I
be alone for a minute?

20:28.792 --> 20:31.056
No!

20:34.030 --> 20:37.625
I'm not raising any flipper grandkids.

20:41.872 --> 20:46.605
No. Look, I just want
to apologize to Penny.

20:46.676 --> 20:51.613
Fine. When you're done,
you head right upstairs.

20:51.681 --> 20:55.014
I'm having Pastor Dave come over
for an emergency house call.

20:58.788 --> 21:02.485
I guess this will teach you to play pranks
on innocent little girls.

21:02.559 --> 21:06.518
This has taught me a lesson.

21:06.596 --> 21:11.693
And that is that I'm not gonna rest until
I get you back <i>way worse</i> than you got me!

21:12.836 --> 21:15.566
Which by the way,
wasn't really that bad!

21:15.639 --> 21:18.836
Actually, it's pretty bad.

21:18.909 --> 21:22.709
<i>( Banjo:Bluegrass )</i>

21:40.697 --> 21:43.097
Cousin Penny went back home, huh?

21:43.166 --> 21:46.658
Oh, wait, did I say cousin?
Yeah, I meant cousin.

21:46.736 --> 21:49.603
Looks like that's two hot girls
you can't have.

21:49.673 --> 21:52.836
Well, thank you for such
a conservative estimate.

21:52.909 --> 21:56.242
- By the way, Donna,
here's your copy of the pictures.
- Oh!

21:56.313 --> 21:58.873
If you flip through 'em real fast,
it looks like Eric's running.

21:58.949 --> 22:00.940
- ( Laughing )
- Gimme those.

22:06.623 --> 22:08.557
( Laughing )
