01:05.556 --> 01:08.693
No! No! Aah!

02:03.547 --> 02:05.013
Did you hear that?

02:05.015 --> 02:06.784
What was that?

02:11.454 --> 02:13.789
I definitely heard that.

02:13.791 --> 02:16.090
Are we up there? No one is
supposed to be up there.

02:16.092 --> 02:17.862
Gary?

02:19.562 --> 02:21.196
<i>Go for Gary.</i>

02:21.198 --> 02:22.664
<i>Is there anyone
walking above us,</i>

02:22.666 --> 02:24.099
<i>or walking on the staircase?</i>

02:24.101 --> 02:26.134
<i>Uh... I got no movement.</i>

02:26.136 --> 02:28.538
<i>I got no one above you.
Hold on.</i>

02:30.174 --> 02:31.839
<i>Hey, Tim?</i>

02:31.841 --> 02:33.507
- <i>Go for Tim.</i>
- <i>Location check.</i>

02:33.509 --> 02:35.510
<i>Third floor.
Client's bedroom.</i>

02:35.512 --> 02:37.712
Nothing here. We're about
to enter the east hallway.

02:37.714 --> 02:39.547
<i>The girls reported
something above them.</i>

02:39.549 --> 02:41.683
<i>I can't verify.
You want to take a look?</i>

02:41.685 --> 02:43.154
On it.

02:45.856 --> 02:48.155
So, what we do is look
for logical explanations.

02:48.157 --> 02:50.124
When we checked the door
and the floorboards,

02:50.126 --> 02:52.126
if you notice the blackout
screen in front of your window,

02:52.128 --> 02:56.530
the window, which was open,
down the hall...

02:56.532 --> 02:58.600
the bathroom window
is also open.

02:58.602 --> 03:01.035
It's a cross breeze.

03:01.037 --> 03:03.839
Door slammed shut
on its own.

03:03.841 --> 03:05.640
The house has
rectangular duct work

03:05.642 --> 03:06.975
attached to your forced air
heating system.

03:06.977 --> 03:08.910
Now, you see
that square piece?

03:08.912 --> 03:10.879
So, when it heats up it expands,
causing it to flex.

03:10.881 --> 03:12.947
And sometimes the duct work
will flex in a row,

03:12.949 --> 03:15.249
similar to dominoes,
but with sound.

03:15.251 --> 03:17.585
Hence, ducts are expanding.

03:17.587 --> 03:19.154
No ghost?

03:19.156 --> 03:20.922
- No ghost.
- This time.

03:23.160 --> 03:24.792
Okay? We good?

03:24.794 --> 03:26.628
- Yeah.
- Great. Okay, let's cut it.

03:26.630 --> 03:29.564
Whoa! Okay, pump the brakes.

03:29.566 --> 03:31.065
I'm the only one
who says cut.

03:31.067 --> 03:34.035
No. But, okay,
what else do you want?

03:34.037 --> 03:36.071
Something pithier.

03:36.073 --> 03:38.172
I heard elephant
pith is a natural shampoo.

03:38.174 --> 03:39.840
And you need to start
being on time.

03:39.842 --> 03:42.511
Thank you so much,
Bruce and Linda.

03:42.513 --> 03:44.178
I hope you feel better about
living in your home.

03:44.180 --> 03:48.048
You won't make us look like
complete idiots on TV?

03:48.050 --> 03:50.184
No, no, God, of course not.
I would've been scared too

03:50.186 --> 03:52.087
with what was going on
in your house.

03:52.089 --> 03:53.954
But luckily you dodged
a bullet, and it's nothing.

03:53.956 --> 03:55.656
Well, thank you.

03:55.658 --> 03:57.525
Thank you. All right,
we'll talk to you soon.

03:57.527 --> 03:59.464
Safe home.
Bye-bye now.

04:00.864 --> 04:02.297
All right, I have
an announcement to make,

04:02.299 --> 04:04.198
and it's not a done deal yet,

04:04.200 --> 04:08.236
but we are in
negotiations with SYFY.

04:08.238 --> 04:10.204
- No way.
- Get out! Really?

04:10.206 --> 04:11.873
Bullshit.

04:11.875 --> 04:13.308
Yeah, so,
if it's not too much to ask,

04:13.310 --> 04:15.944
please do what I say.

04:15.946 --> 04:18.846
If I ask for a little
more epigrammatic...

04:18.849 --> 04:20.247
That's another word
for "elephant pith."

04:20.249 --> 04:21.916
...just indulge me,

04:21.918 --> 04:23.318
that is, if you want
to get off the Internet

04:23.320 --> 04:24.789
and onto national television.
Yeah?

04:25.556 --> 04:27.989
Okay, so they want more
behind-the-scenes stuff,

04:27.991 --> 04:29.189
so cameras on all the time.

04:29.191 --> 04:31.158
Let's go, I want to go over
what we have for our next shoot.

04:31.160 --> 04:32.927
Hey, check out this address.

04:32.929 --> 04:36.965
It's 311 Lenox Ave.,
Edgemont Hills, New York.

04:36.967 --> 04:38.867
Whoa, looks like
in the last 300 years

04:38.869 --> 04:42.771
there have been 14 unsolved
murders at this address.

04:42.773 --> 04:45.239
Neighbors swear that
the place is haunted,

04:45.241 --> 04:47.576
and it is currently vacant.

04:47.578 --> 04:51.780
That's it. Lisa,
get us in 311 Lenox Ave.

04:51.782 --> 04:53.081
in Edgemont Hills.

04:53.083 --> 04:54.883
The usual, three days.

04:54.885 --> 04:56.985
Billy, go up early
and set up cable and audio.

04:56.987 --> 04:58.886
Stacy, Lisa,
I want you to research,

04:58.888 --> 05:01.355
find out everything you can
about the history of this place.

05:01.357 --> 05:02.759
All right, let's go.

05:06.263 --> 05:08.299
- What?
- Can you define early?

07:25.768 --> 07:27.437
Hey, James.

07:28.504 --> 07:30.237
Hey, Jamie.

07:30.239 --> 07:32.006
- Yeah?
- Can you help me out with this?

07:32.008 --> 07:33.908
- With what?
- I think I broke something.

07:33.910 --> 07:35.744
I don't know, I think there's,
like, a short here?

07:35.746 --> 07:37.145
- What'd you do with it?
- It's like right there.

07:37.147 --> 07:38.812
Ah!

07:38.814 --> 07:40.047
What the heck, man?

07:40.049 --> 07:41.883
Electrocution is funny.

07:41.885 --> 07:43.884
- You don't get to do that.
- It was a joke.

07:43.886 --> 07:46.086
- I'll buy him another coffee.
- That's not the point.

07:46.088 --> 07:48.122
You got to stop screwing around,
it's not cute anymore.

07:48.124 --> 07:49.924
- You do that stuff all the time.
- Grow up.

07:49.926 --> 07:51.391
You know, it's funny,
I thought older brothers

07:51.393 --> 07:53.026
were supposed
to be supportive,

07:53.028 --> 07:56.030
but you never got that memo,
did you?

07:56.032 --> 07:58.465
It's okay, though.
I forgive you, I forgive you.

07:58.467 --> 08:00.134
From now on
I'll be a team player.

08:00.136 --> 08:02.069
No more shenanigans,
no more pot.

08:02.071 --> 08:04.338
The house shakes...

08:04.340 --> 08:05.910
it was a good talk.

08:11.982 --> 08:13.448
Ah, baby steps.

08:13.450 --> 08:14.752
Okay.

08:23.292 --> 08:24.826
Oh!

08:24.828 --> 08:27.063
Shit.

08:37.907 --> 08:40.073
Ah, here we go.

08:40.075 --> 08:41.842
All the way.

08:41.845 --> 08:45.282
Going to the house,
doing all the things.

09:09.940 --> 09:12.008
Happy birthday, baby.

09:29.492 --> 09:31.291
It's my birthday.

09:31.293 --> 09:34.264
Right, and what greater gift
could I give you?

09:35.931 --> 09:39.170
Wow, so, so benevolent of you.

09:40.503 --> 09:42.339
Nothing could ever
change now.

09:44.541 --> 09:46.540
- Okay, resume.
- Okay.

09:48.478 --> 09:49.977
Oh...

09:49.979 --> 09:51.348
wait, wait, let me check.

09:53.984 --> 09:56.387
- We got to go.
- All right.

10:17.106 --> 10:20.007
Is this the, um,
permit place?

10:20.009 --> 10:21.309
What kind of permit?

10:21.311 --> 10:22.910
I'm with a show.

10:22.912 --> 10:24.112
I'm with
<i>Ghost Investigations.</i>

10:24.114 --> 10:25.382
We have a permit.

10:26.582 --> 10:27.884
Waiting.

10:34.157 --> 10:35.990
It's not ready yet.

10:35.992 --> 10:37.561
Okay, um...

10:39.296 --> 10:40.931
do you guys have a john?

10:42.431 --> 10:45.333
And I don't mean a corporate
closeted married guy

10:45.335 --> 10:47.135
looking for a cheap BJ,
you know?

10:47.137 --> 10:49.069
I don't sell
my body anymore.

10:49.071 --> 10:51.140
Not since I found the Lord,
our savior, Jesus Christ.

10:58.148 --> 11:00.350
That way. Thank you.

12:19.696 --> 12:21.364
Okay.

12:48.324 --> 12:50.527
Hey, all right.

12:51.728 --> 12:53.497
Here we go.

13:15.151 --> 13:16.787
Mm-hmm.

13:18.455 --> 13:20.523
Mm-hmm.

13:25.427 --> 13:27.030
Mm-hmm.

13:27.830 --> 13:29.329
That's a nice touch.

13:29.331 --> 13:31.198
You're talented.

13:31.200 --> 13:34.204
Right next to the portrait
of the fake flowers.

14:03.166 --> 14:04.799
Will somebody
call him, please?

14:04.801 --> 14:08.305
Will you relax?
He's coming.

14:09.272 --> 14:10.838
See? There he is.

14:10.840 --> 14:12.906
Hey, guys. Sorry.

14:12.908 --> 14:14.641
Glad you could join us.

14:14.643 --> 14:16.644
Wait. Damn it,
I forgot something.

14:16.646 --> 14:18.846
- Seriously?
- I'll be right back.

14:21.518 --> 14:22.853
- Oh, my God!
- Oh! Oh!

14:24.420 --> 14:26.290
Oh, my God.
Someone call 911.

14:29.825 --> 14:31.258
Are you serious?

14:31.260 --> 14:33.194
Dude, I had you.

14:33.196 --> 14:34.594
- No, you didn't, okay?
- Not even a little bit?

14:34.596 --> 14:36.463
Not even a little bit.

14:36.465 --> 14:38.332
Hey, you have no credibility
for giving your brother shit

14:38.334 --> 14:40.200
- if you're going to fuck around.
- I told you I'm good.

14:40.202 --> 14:41.836
- Get... no, get off me.
- Kiss it, make it better.

14:41.838 --> 14:44.541
Ew, yuck! I can't. No.

14:46.209 --> 14:47.742
- Here, have a hand job. Go.
- Thank you.

14:47.744 --> 14:49.113
Finally.

14:53.917 --> 14:55.384
Ready?

14:56.786 --> 14:58.586
We're on our way
to 311 Lenox Avenue.

14:58.588 --> 15:00.554
There have been
14 unexplained deaths there.

15:00.556 --> 15:02.823
Wait a second,
I'm just going to make a...

15:02.825 --> 15:05.195
And action.

15:06.696 --> 15:08.462
Okay, we're on our way
to 311 Lenox Avenue.

15:08.464 --> 15:10.363
There have been 14 unexplained
deaths there...

15:10.365 --> 15:13.733
- Murders.
- Murders there, since 1692.

15:13.735 --> 15:16.337
And seven different structures
have stood on the plot,

15:16.339 --> 15:17.939
including a church
originally.

15:17.941 --> 15:19.774
I'm going to get some B roll

15:19.776 --> 15:21.675
- of driving real quick.
- Okay, great, great, yeah.

15:21.677 --> 15:23.410
Okay, here's B roll
of driving.

16:36.952 --> 16:39.822
Oh, two bathrooms.

16:41.356 --> 16:43.593
Fucking fancy.

16:50.966 --> 16:53.333
Master bedroom.

16:53.335 --> 16:54.870
Master.

19:09.438 --> 19:11.504
So, 46 Hightown Road,
did you say?

19:11.506 --> 19:13.107
Forty four.

19:13.109 --> 19:14.945
Forty four, right.

19:17.045 --> 19:18.546
- Greenburg.
- Greenburg.

19:18.548 --> 19:20.481
Excuse me? Hi.

19:20.483 --> 19:22.715
We're producers of the show
<i>Ghost Investigations.</i>

19:22.717 --> 19:25.886
We're here about a filming
permit for 311 Lenox,

19:25.888 --> 19:27.087
in Edgemont Hills.

19:27.089 --> 19:28.822
Our colleague
was here earlier

19:28.824 --> 19:30.924
and he said the permit
wasn't ready yet.

19:30.926 --> 19:33.194
The gentleman
in the baseball cap?

19:33.196 --> 19:35.128
And you all would like
to film your...

19:35.130 --> 19:38.834
your little television program
up at 311 Lenox?

19:39.836 --> 19:41.171
- Yeah.
- Yup.

19:43.638 --> 19:45.138
Yeah, you shouldn't
go to that house.

19:45.140 --> 19:46.840
- It's creepy.
- Right.

19:46.842 --> 19:48.842
Like creepy,
like the music plays

19:48.844 --> 19:50.845
even though the power's
been turned off,

19:50.847 --> 19:53.614
and the lights are turning
on and off, that sort of thing?

19:57.954 --> 20:00.221
No, like people being chopped up
in itsy-bitsy pieces

20:00.223 --> 20:03.123
and reassembled on the wall
in the shape of a cross

20:03.125 --> 20:04.795
kind of creepy.

20:08.731 --> 20:10.567
Have a good film shoot.

20:51.006 --> 20:52.241
Hello?

20:59.982 --> 21:01.251
Jamie, real original.

21:09.759 --> 21:11.261
Jamie?

21:12.861 --> 21:14.662
Dude, if you've been here
this whole time

21:14.664 --> 21:17.600
while I've been setting up,
that is not cool.

23:28.731 --> 23:31.098
So, who's the guy who
texted you about the house?

23:31.100 --> 23:32.799
I can't reveal my sources.

23:32.801 --> 23:35.972
Okay, that's cute.
But seriously, who?

23:37.372 --> 23:38.871
A ghost.

23:38.873 --> 23:42.242
- Stacy.
- David Ellington.

23:42.244 --> 23:44.078
Okay, who's David Ellington?

23:44.080 --> 23:45.713
What's with all
the questions?

23:45.715 --> 23:46.980
Why are you being
so secretive?

23:46.982 --> 23:48.482
I'm not.

23:48.484 --> 23:50.149
We may want to interview him.
Who is he?

23:50.151 --> 23:51.984
He doesn't want
to be interviewed.

23:51.986 --> 23:53.753
- Why, what did he say?
- Who the hell is he?

23:53.755 --> 23:55.755
David Ellington,
he took over ownership

23:55.757 --> 23:58.157
of the property in 1992,
when the last murder occurred,

23:58.159 --> 24:00.761
and it's been vacant
ever since.

24:00.763 --> 24:03.363
Well, why did
he text you?

24:03.365 --> 24:05.132
Oh, I don't know, baby.

24:05.134 --> 24:08.335
Maybe because I'm a producer
on a hit Internet show

24:08.337 --> 24:10.203
about haunted houses,
and he has a haunted house.

24:10.205 --> 24:11.771
Work on him.
I want him on camera.

24:11.773 --> 24:12.940
All right,
I'll get his address.

24:12.942 --> 24:15.509
Wow, they found them all...

24:15.511 --> 24:17.747
- What?
- ...crucified.

24:18.947 --> 24:20.880
What do you mean
crucified?

24:20.882 --> 24:22.151
Look.

24:32.427 --> 24:34.394
All at 311 Lenox?

24:34.396 --> 24:36.363
All at 311 Lenox.

24:36.365 --> 24:38.298
And some of them
had these strange symbols

24:38.300 --> 24:40.032
branded on their wrists.

24:40.034 --> 24:41.367
- Holocaust survivors?
- I don't know.

24:41.369 --> 24:43.169
They're all blacked out.

24:43.171 --> 24:44.972
Ongoing murder investigations
are classified.

24:44.974 --> 24:46.440
Even hundreds
of years old?

24:46.442 --> 24:49.345
There's no statute
of limitations on murder.

25:21.109 --> 25:22.411
Sorry.

25:25.013 --> 25:26.379
- Stacy.
- Yeah.

25:26.381 --> 25:27.880
Did you get the owner,
Ellington,

25:27.882 --> 25:29.415
whatever his name is,

25:29.417 --> 25:30.517
to change his mind
about being on camera?

25:30.519 --> 25:32.286
Uh, yeah.

25:32.288 --> 25:33.986
Yeah, I told you
he won't do it, so...

25:33.988 --> 25:35.489
And I don't care.
I said I want him.

25:35.491 --> 25:36.956
Well, he can't.

25:36.958 --> 25:38.325
Then let me talk to him.

25:38.327 --> 25:39.492
No.

25:39.494 --> 25:41.028
Why not?

25:41.030 --> 25:42.495
Uh, because...

25:42.497 --> 25:44.998
um, because he's...

25:45.000 --> 25:46.232
He's what?

25:46.234 --> 25:48.501
Dead.

25:48.503 --> 25:50.103
What are you
talking about?

25:50.105 --> 25:51.271
Wiki says he owns
the building.

25:51.273 --> 25:53.072
Wiki says a lot
of bullshit.

25:53.074 --> 25:58.544
David Ellington,
born 1865, died 1934.

25:58.546 --> 26:00.513
New York death
certificate.

26:00.515 --> 26:04.384
He was the owner of
this place until then.

26:04.386 --> 26:06.220
And...

26:06.222 --> 26:08.291
he died here.

26:22.338 --> 26:24.605
Well, who's been texting you?

26:24.607 --> 26:26.540
And why is he
pretending to be a dead guy?

26:26.542 --> 26:28.541
I don't know,
but I can find out.

26:28.543 --> 26:30.109
Please do.
And while you're at it,

26:30.111 --> 26:31.611
find out who owns the house now,

26:31.613 --> 26:33.382
so I know who's going
to sue me for trespassing.

26:35.083 --> 26:36.852
Thank you.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.402
Billy.

27:46.621 --> 27:50.223
He did a good job down here.
Let's check everything's okay.

27:50.225 --> 27:51.625
I'm going to lay
some audio down.

27:51.627 --> 27:53.626
Check upstairs first.

27:53.628 --> 27:55.531
If Billy's up there,
can you bring him down?

29:29.690 --> 29:31.760
What happened here?

29:33.462 --> 29:35.395
- What do you mean?
- All their stuff is still here.

29:35.397 --> 29:40.399
Their clothes, their shoes,
their crystals.

29:40.401 --> 29:42.269
Why didn't they have someone
pack all this stuff up

29:42.271 --> 29:44.203
and have it shipped
to wherever they are now?

29:44.205 --> 29:47.574
Well, all the details are murky,
but from what I understand,

29:47.576 --> 29:49.742
whatever happened here...

29:49.744 --> 29:51.744
had the last tenants
so freaked out,

29:51.746 --> 29:54.280
that they didn't want anything
that reminded them of it.

29:54.282 --> 29:56.148
Or they didn't want
that shit to follow them.

29:56.150 --> 29:58.053
Exactly.

30:19.174 --> 30:21.176
Well, there's no reception.

30:22.276 --> 30:24.277
Wait, hold on.

30:24.279 --> 30:26.279
<i>...Can't take your call.</i>

30:26.281 --> 30:28.548
<i>Please leave a message
after the tone.</i>

30:30.452 --> 30:32.555
Billy, where the hell are you?
Please, call me back.

30:34.455 --> 30:36.623
We're ready to do
a baseline reading.

30:36.625 --> 30:38.657
Alison. Bag. Room.

30:38.659 --> 30:42.261
Hate. Much. You.

30:42.263 --> 30:44.130
Someone needs to secure
the windows.

30:44.132 --> 30:45.632
It's drafty upstairs.

30:45.634 --> 30:48.503
Yeah! I'm on it already.

30:57.311 --> 30:58.811
Just give me
a couple minutes, babe.

30:58.813 --> 31:00.382
Mm-hmm.

31:12.394 --> 31:16.499
Hey, do you guys know
what Novum is?

31:20.168 --> 31:21.902
I couldn't find anything
on the Internet about it,

31:21.904 --> 31:23.636
other than it's Latin
for "nine."

31:23.638 --> 31:25.871
Yeah, because it is
also the name

31:25.873 --> 31:28.308
of one of the
most stealthy, vicious,

31:28.310 --> 31:30.809
satanic cults that exists.

31:30.811 --> 31:34.213
Their mission is to get
Lucifer back to heaven,

31:34.215 --> 31:35.848
where he belongs,

31:35.850 --> 31:37.450
because he used to be
a good angel,

31:37.452 --> 31:39.386
and they believe
he can be again.

31:39.388 --> 31:41.855
Originally Lucifer
was an angel for God,

31:41.857 --> 31:43.389
until he fell from grace.

31:43.391 --> 31:45.258
Novum have been around
since Christ,

31:45.260 --> 31:46.526
worshiping Lucifer.

31:46.528 --> 31:48.461
Okay, and who do they target?

31:48.463 --> 31:52.866
They believe that the truest,
purist form of sacrifice to God,

31:52.868 --> 31:55.868
is the most precious life
to the most devoted to God,

31:55.870 --> 31:58.871
and the most
precious to them.

31:58.873 --> 32:02.541
Novum believes that in order for
Lucifer to get back to heaven,

32:02.543 --> 32:03.976
and in God's good graces,

32:03.978 --> 32:07.379
they need to kill
59,049 firstborns

32:07.381 --> 32:08.982
of people of the cloth.

32:08.984 --> 32:10.884
What? So, how many people
have they killed?

32:10.886 --> 32:12.418
All right.

32:12.420 --> 32:13.919
What are you guys doing?

32:13.921 --> 32:15.888
We're all set.
Are you ready?

32:15.890 --> 32:17.857
- Yup. Ready, ready.
- Let's do it.

32:17.859 --> 32:19.395
Yup, set up.
Good to go.

32:25.900 --> 32:27.634
Yeah, it's probably
the circuit breaker.

32:27.636 --> 32:29.668
- We'll check it out.
- Whoa, hold on.

32:29.670 --> 32:31.271
If it's anything electrical,
I'll do it.

32:31.273 --> 32:32.871
Bring the equipment
with you.

32:32.873 --> 32:34.907
Check for activity
while you're down there.

32:34.909 --> 32:37.577
If this is Billy,
we're going to have words.

32:43.784 --> 32:45.918
In the back,
it's near the boiler.

32:45.920 --> 32:48.456
Okay, so, the power
just went out.

32:49.925 --> 32:51.724
Get the lights back on,
which will determine

32:51.726 --> 32:53.359
what happened to them.

32:53.361 --> 32:55.028
People who believe
in the paranormal

32:55.030 --> 32:56.629
believe that power sources
have been known to drain

32:56.631 --> 32:57.896
when depressed by spirits.

32:57.898 --> 32:59.633
Those people also believe

32:59.635 --> 33:01.434
that an entity will use
the power from batteries

33:01.436 --> 33:02.735
and other power sources

33:02.737 --> 33:03.972
to manifest themselves
in our world.

33:05.940 --> 33:07.973
That's why we're here.
To investigate.

33:09.610 --> 33:10.944
You guys hear that?

33:10.946 --> 33:12.745
Gary?

33:12.747 --> 33:14.880
Yeah, I'm here.

33:14.882 --> 33:17.619
All right,
time for an EVP.

33:23.658 --> 33:26.661
If there's anyone down here,
can you make that sound?

33:36.737 --> 33:38.673
We're here to help you.

33:39.840 --> 33:41.974
Can you make that sound again?

33:43.678 --> 33:44.911
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

33:44.913 --> 33:46.482
It's in here.

33:47.983 --> 33:49.683
Ready?

33:49.685 --> 33:50.953
Uh-huh.

33:55.456 --> 33:57.025
It stopped.

33:58.327 --> 33:59.729
You guys hear anything?

34:01.730 --> 34:04.333
If you're in here,
can you make that sound again?

34:06.435 --> 34:08.100
I, uh...

34:08.101 --> 34:10.473
Watch your head.

34:11.839 --> 34:13.975
What a loser.
There we go.

34:15.677 --> 34:17.911
- Not a ghost.
- Not a ghost?

34:17.913 --> 34:19.679
Nope.

34:19.681 --> 34:21.547
Let's leave them in the dark
for a little bit longer.

34:21.549 --> 34:23.750
I got a camera
right on Stefan.

34:23.752 --> 34:25.485
Sounds good to me, man.

34:25.487 --> 34:26.953
We'll turn the power back on
in five minutes.

34:28.056 --> 34:29.525
All right, cut, Jamie.

34:37.031 --> 34:38.732
Stacy? Stacy?

34:38.734 --> 34:40.433
She was just here.

34:40.435 --> 34:41.900
Gary, get the light on!

34:41.902 --> 34:44.770
I'm trying. Something's
shorting out the box.

34:44.772 --> 34:46.806
Tim! No!

34:46.808 --> 34:48.911
Stacy, Lisa, what's going on?
Where are you?

34:49.944 --> 34:51.043
Lisa?

34:51.045 --> 34:53.081
Where's Stacy? Hello?

34:56.951 --> 34:58.821
Lisa, where are you guys?

35:02.056 --> 35:04.092
Gary? Jamie?

35:08.897 --> 35:10.063
Stacy?

35:10.065 --> 35:11.864
Stacy? Stacy?

35:11.866 --> 35:13.335
Stacy!

35:15.436 --> 35:16.772
Stacy!

35:43.197 --> 35:45.134
Stacy.

35:59.947 --> 36:02.817
Stacy! Stacy!

36:09.491 --> 36:11.159
Stacy!

36:18.132 --> 36:20.069
Stacy.

36:51.232 --> 36:54.035
Gary? Jamie?

37:01.676 --> 37:03.045
Gary!

37:18.592 --> 37:20.663
Oh, damn it. Come on.

37:21.529 --> 37:23.195
Shit! Shit!

37:23.197 --> 37:24.833
Fuck. No!

37:26.201 --> 37:27.503
No.

37:28.770 --> 37:30.906
No, please, please, stop!

37:32.641 --> 37:34.806
Please, please stop!
Stop! Don't kill me!

37:34.808 --> 37:36.911
Please, please, stop! No!

37:38.712 --> 37:40.715
Surprise!

37:46.186 --> 37:48.154
Aw, baby.

37:48.156 --> 37:50.493
I'm so sorry.

37:57.898 --> 37:59.232
Oh!

38:07.042 --> 38:09.244
You should have seen your face,
seriously.

38:11.313 --> 38:13.079
Hey, where's Billy?

38:13.081 --> 38:15.081
Your guess is
as good as mine.

38:15.083 --> 38:17.083
Wait, he wasn't
a part of this?

38:17.085 --> 38:19.554
He helped plan,
but was a no-show.

38:25.125 --> 38:26.726
You never looked better.

38:33.668 --> 38:36.869
I love you all,
and you're fired.

38:43.310 --> 38:45.210
Really?

38:45.212 --> 38:47.115
Are you surprised?

39:14.275 --> 39:16.308
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

39:16.310 --> 39:18.110
Are we going to do a show
tonight or what?

39:18.112 --> 39:20.045
- Let's get to work.
- Still no Billy, guys?

39:20.047 --> 39:22.715
No. I've cycled through
every video feed that we have.

39:22.717 --> 39:24.384
He's not here for sure.

39:24.386 --> 39:27.690
I have him setting up earlier,
but never leaving.

39:28.889 --> 39:30.690
All right.

39:30.692 --> 39:33.596
I'm going to go outside,
see if I get better reception.

39:47.375 --> 39:49.244
There's just no reception.

39:50.811 --> 39:52.344
- Uh, Tim?
- Shit, I had two bars...

39:52.346 --> 39:54.350
- Tim!
- What?

39:57.351 --> 39:58.953
Billy?

40:02.924 --> 40:04.192
Billy.

40:05.360 --> 40:06.793
What the hell, man?

40:06.795 --> 40:08.364
What are you doing?

40:11.366 --> 40:13.002
Oh, God.

40:16.036 --> 40:18.406
Like, why can't you just
make my life easy, huh?

40:20.141 --> 40:21.373
Why do you constantly
have to create drama?

40:21.375 --> 40:23.208
You don't understand.

40:23.210 --> 40:24.376
Understand what?
What are you...

40:24.378 --> 40:26.214
hey, look at me.

40:34.288 --> 40:35.887
Jamie, turn the camera off.

40:35.889 --> 40:37.123
What's up with the ball?

40:37.125 --> 40:38.393
Jamie?

40:40.828 --> 40:42.263
Come on, Billy.

40:43.397 --> 40:44.864
Billy, come on.

40:44.866 --> 40:46.768
I can't go back
in there.

40:49.170 --> 40:50.438
Go ahead.

41:20.201 --> 41:22.871
Okay, just listen to me.

41:24.205 --> 41:27.442
This is not a ghost ball.

41:29.243 --> 41:32.545
It isn't supernatural.
This is just a regular ball.

41:32.547 --> 41:34.215
No, it's not.

41:44.391 --> 41:45.860
You see that?

41:48.096 --> 41:50.132
There's nothing there.

41:54.368 --> 41:58.471
Billy, there is
a logical explanation

41:58.473 --> 42:01.373
for whatever you think
happened here.

42:01.375 --> 42:03.911
How can you not believe in evil
after what we've seen?

42:05.212 --> 42:06.514
Paranormal or not.

42:08.482 --> 42:11.252
Now, if you believe in evil,
then you have to believe in God.

42:12.587 --> 42:14.289
And God beats evil,
doesn't he?

42:24.998 --> 42:26.234
Look...

42:28.969 --> 42:32.304
you did a really great job
setting everything up in there.

42:32.306 --> 42:34.509
No, I'm serious.

42:35.543 --> 42:37.311
You did.

42:38.078 --> 42:40.212
Really.

42:40.214 --> 42:43.551
So why don't you come inside
and see how it feels?

42:46.253 --> 42:48.924
You can always
leave again if...

42:50.424 --> 42:51.924
whatever.

42:53.594 --> 42:55.230
Okay?

42:57.098 --> 42:58.801
Okay.

43:00.268 --> 43:01.570
Come on, bud.

43:03.371 --> 43:06.041
Hey, uh, maybe you want
to leave that out here.

43:12.980 --> 43:14.415
It's just a regular ball.

43:33.368 --> 43:35.668
Listen, whatever
he thinks happened to him,

43:35.670 --> 43:38.570
it really freaked him out.

43:38.572 --> 43:40.572
Honestly, I've never seen him
like this before.

43:40.574 --> 43:43.375
I'm actually pretty
worried about him.

43:43.377 --> 43:45.076
Yeah.

43:45.078 --> 43:47.045
We should interview him.

43:47.047 --> 43:49.581
I mean, I think he's still
messing with us,

43:49.583 --> 43:53.119
but if he actually saw something
we should get him on camera.

43:53.121 --> 43:54.587
At least he'd be
contributing something.

43:54.589 --> 43:57.860
I'm asking you
to back off.

43:59.594 --> 44:01.694
Tim, this is a really
great story line.

44:01.696 --> 44:03.197
Please.

44:07.935 --> 44:09.067
Okay.

44:09.069 --> 44:10.335
Sure.

44:10.337 --> 44:11.572
Thanks.

45:04.525 --> 45:06.491
I really don't want to do this.

45:06.493 --> 45:08.059
Okay, now...

45:08.061 --> 45:09.395
I'm not doing this.

45:09.397 --> 45:11.029
No. No, I'm not, really.
Okay?

45:11.031 --> 45:13.431
Please, Billy.

45:13.433 --> 45:15.233
Okay, why don't
you just have a seat

45:15.235 --> 45:17.339
on the edge of the bed,
right there.

45:18.706 --> 45:20.242
I really don't want
to do this.

45:21.241 --> 45:22.276
Tim says we have to.

45:23.677 --> 45:26.080
So, tell me about the ball.

45:28.549 --> 45:30.282
- You're fucking with me.
- I'm not.

45:30.284 --> 45:31.683
- I'm not doing this.
- I'm not, really.

45:31.685 --> 45:33.386
I...

45:33.388 --> 45:35.186
I know you and Tim
don't see eye to eye

45:35.188 --> 45:36.788
on the whole God
and ghosts thing,

45:36.790 --> 45:38.657
but you know I believe.

45:38.659 --> 45:40.395
I'm with you on this one.

45:42.130 --> 45:43.529
Look, even though
you may not like me...

45:43.531 --> 45:45.331
we've had our share
of run-ins in the past

45:45.333 --> 45:47.233
about other things,

45:47.235 --> 45:49.067
at least I know you respect
that I'm a believer like you,

45:49.069 --> 45:51.005
and the only thing
that really counts in life.

45:51.538 --> 45:53.007
Really?

45:55.476 --> 45:57.076
See, I had no idea that...

45:57.078 --> 45:58.647
that you were such
a man of God.

46:04.652 --> 46:06.554
Come on,
of course you did.

46:08.121 --> 46:09.422
Now...

46:11.391 --> 46:13.793
what did you see here
when you were alone?

46:13.795 --> 46:15.594
You don't want to know.

46:15.596 --> 46:17.163
I really do.

46:17.165 --> 46:19.398
Trust me on this one.
You don't.

46:19.400 --> 46:21.069
Please, Billy.

46:25.306 --> 46:28.577
Well, I saw a lot
of dead people.

46:30.143 --> 46:31.309
Really?

46:31.311 --> 46:33.114
Like who?

46:35.549 --> 46:37.451
You, for one.

46:44.192 --> 46:46.391
Stefan, I told you
to back off!

46:46.393 --> 46:48.360
And I told you
it was good TV.

46:48.362 --> 46:50.628
Lest you forget, that's what
we're trying to do here,

46:50.630 --> 46:52.498
make a television show.

46:52.500 --> 46:54.703
Hopefully one that'll get us
on a network, so suck it up!

47:23.797 --> 47:25.297
Take the camera,

47:25.299 --> 47:26.465
and don't point it
at the lights.

47:26.467 --> 47:28.233
Just point it here...

47:30.871 --> 47:32.438
- Wait...
- Yeah.

47:32.440 --> 47:34.306
What else are you
going to take?

47:34.308 --> 47:36.208
Somebody give me something
to put on television.

47:36.210 --> 47:37.476
Are we all set?

47:37.478 --> 47:39.177
EVP and laser grids are set.

47:39.179 --> 47:41.315
Infrared camera's replaced,
right?

47:43.217 --> 47:44.416
Billy?

47:44.418 --> 47:45.918
What?

47:45.920 --> 47:47.585
Stefan asked if you replaced
the IR cameras.

47:47.587 --> 47:49.290
Oh. Yeah.

47:50.190 --> 47:51.625
Thanks. Ready.

47:52.627 --> 47:54.259
You look beautiful.

47:54.261 --> 47:55.529
- Thank you.
- Where's Jamie?

47:57.831 --> 47:59.697
Uh...

47:59.699 --> 48:01.534
I don't know, but we need him
to shoot the intro.

48:01.536 --> 48:03.869
Billy, grab a camera.

48:03.871 --> 48:05.371
Yup.

48:06.574 --> 48:07.773
You okay?

48:07.775 --> 48:09.641
Yeah, sure.

48:09.643 --> 48:11.643
Can we do a quick
little bup, bup, bup...

48:11.645 --> 48:13.612
We've set up motion sensors
and cameras in every room.

48:13.614 --> 48:15.848
We've got night-vision
for later.

48:15.850 --> 48:17.315
Laser...

48:17.317 --> 48:19.518
thermal cameras
and laser grids.

48:19.520 --> 48:21.286
And everything is linked back
to the video village.

48:21.288 --> 48:22.855
As we like to call it,
central command.

48:22.857 --> 48:23.855
Where we can capture
anything that happens.

48:23.857 --> 48:25.224
Or doesn't.

48:27.962 --> 48:29.728
On me, in three...

48:29.730 --> 48:30.862
us...

48:30.864 --> 48:32.665
in three, two...

48:32.667 --> 48:34.599
let's take a look around.

48:34.601 --> 48:36.467
We've set up motion sensors
and cameras in every room.

48:36.469 --> 48:38.871
We got night vision for later,
laser grids, and thermals.

48:38.873 --> 48:40.773
And everything is linked back
to the video village.

48:40.775 --> 48:42.541
We like to call it
central command.

48:42.543 --> 48:43.875
Where we can capture
anything that happens.

48:43.877 --> 48:45.446
Or doesn't.

48:48.683 --> 48:49.918
Billy, come on, man.

48:50.817 --> 48:52.684
Yeah, um...

48:52.686 --> 48:55.286
do you guys want
to start down here?

48:55.288 --> 48:56.857
Let's just do this, okay?

48:58.893 --> 49:00.561
Yeah, okay.

49:02.964 --> 49:05.598
<i>Tim, we got
movement in the upstairs bedroom.</i>

49:05.600 --> 49:07.532
What?

49:07.534 --> 49:09.601
<i>There's something
in the front of the house.</i>

49:09.603 --> 49:11.505
Okay, copy.
We'll check it out.

49:13.406 --> 49:15.509
Okay, we're going to check out
this reported movement.

49:24.317 --> 49:25.717
Oh, Jesus!

49:25.719 --> 49:27.353
Fuck!

49:27.355 --> 49:29.487
- Come on, Jamie!
- Payback!

49:29.489 --> 49:30.922
- Fuck.
- Oh, I got to get this.

49:32.560 --> 49:34.259
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Billy, no.

49:34.261 --> 49:35.494
- Whoa.
- No, stop, stop.

49:35.496 --> 49:37.496
It's not funny, asshole!

49:37.498 --> 49:39.398
- You deserved it.
- Fuck you, all right?

49:39.400 --> 49:40.833
Stay the fuck away from me.

49:40.835 --> 49:42.835
What? It was just a prank.

49:46.339 --> 49:48.407
Hey, cut the crap.

49:48.409 --> 49:50.808
Seriously! Enough!

49:50.810 --> 49:51.979
We have a show to do.

49:55.750 --> 49:56.985
Billy.

50:00.788 --> 50:02.320
Guys, where's Billy?

50:02.322 --> 50:03.956
He went outside.

50:03.958 --> 50:06.324
No, baby, just let him cool off.
He'll be okay. Really.

50:06.326 --> 50:10.295
Okay. We have a job to do,
so no more pranks.

50:10.297 --> 50:11.600
Agreed?

50:12.366 --> 50:13.565
Um...

50:13.567 --> 50:15.400
oh, I have movement.

50:15.402 --> 50:16.768
For real this time?

50:16.770 --> 50:18.971
- No more games.
- No games.

50:18.973 --> 50:20.572
Front bedroom, second floor.

50:24.311 --> 50:25.978
- What was that?
- That felt like an earthquake.

50:25.980 --> 50:27.748
It's probably just
the radiator going on.

50:28.882 --> 50:30.884
Clanking ducts,
or whatever.

50:45.366 --> 50:46.799
You picking up that noise?

50:46.801 --> 50:48.433
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

50:48.435 --> 50:49.802
- From the bedroom?
- <i>Yup.</i>

50:51.806 --> 50:53.505
<i>There's more movement.</i>

50:53.507 --> 50:55.340
Where?

50:55.342 --> 50:56.641
<i>Looks like it's right
in front of you.</i>

50:58.378 --> 51:00.579
Everybody's
accounted for, right?

51:00.581 --> 51:02.980
<i>That's not any of us.</i>

51:02.982 --> 51:05.851
And it's definitely not Billy?

51:05.853 --> 51:08.023
<i>He's not in the house.</i>

51:09.656 --> 51:11.523
Wait, do you hear that?
It's getting louder.

51:11.525 --> 51:13.558
<i>Yeah, there's
definitely something</i>

51:13.560 --> 51:15.427
<i>moving around in there.</i>

51:15.429 --> 51:17.862
<i>Guys, whatever it is,
it's coming from</i>

51:17.864 --> 51:19.898
<i>right on the other side
of that door.</i>

51:19.900 --> 51:22.900
Okay, we've ruled out
one of the crew members

51:22.902 --> 51:26.003
moving around
inside this room.

51:26.005 --> 51:28.040
So, it's time
to take a look.

51:46.560 --> 51:48.563
There's nothing here, Gary.

52:05.478 --> 52:08.579
<i>Gary, check again for Billy.
Everybody look for Billy.</i>

52:08.581 --> 52:10.384
Billy?

52:11.585 --> 52:13.455
- Billy?
- Billy!

52:16.056 --> 52:17.688
Billy!

52:17.690 --> 52:18.924
I'm not finding him
in the house.

52:18.926 --> 52:21.692
- Billy?
- Billy!

52:21.694 --> 52:23.364
Billy!

52:26.500 --> 52:28.065
- Gary...
- What?

52:28.067 --> 52:30.571
Gary, Gary, take a look at this.

52:31.172 --> 52:32.639
Jesus.

52:37.011 --> 52:38.677
- Billy!
- Stefan, look at this.

52:38.679 --> 52:39.947
What?

52:56.897 --> 52:58.563
Billy, really?

52:58.565 --> 52:59.831
Alison, what the fuck
are you doing?

52:59.833 --> 53:01.168
You shouldn't be helping him.

53:06.139 --> 53:07.442
Alison?

53:31.531 --> 53:33.434
Take her down.

53:35.636 --> 53:37.172
What's going on?

53:38.138 --> 53:39.873
I heard a scream.

53:52.219 --> 53:54.585
Fuck the door. Fuck!

53:54.587 --> 53:56.855
Call 911.

53:56.857 --> 53:58.793
I'm trying. It's dead.
My phone is dead.

54:07.201 --> 54:09.571
Hey, help us!

54:17.210 --> 54:18.846
<i>What the fuck?</i>

54:21.214 --> 54:22.880
I'm sorry.
Do you have service?

54:22.882 --> 54:24.849
- No.
- Okay, come on, we got to go.

54:24.851 --> 54:26.684
- We can't just leave her.
- It's not safe. We got to go.

54:26.686 --> 54:28.089
We'll come back for her.
Come on.

54:38.565 --> 54:40.799
Help us!

54:40.801 --> 54:42.270
Help us!

55:19.206 --> 55:21.038
No, we've got to stay together.

55:21.040 --> 55:22.808
Are we going
to the basement or not?

55:22.810 --> 55:25.043
- Yes.
- No. No.

55:25.045 --> 55:27.279
No, someone needs to man
video village and watch our backs.

55:27.281 --> 55:29.213
Okay? So you three come
with me to the basement,

55:29.215 --> 55:31.183
and you go with Gary and Lisa
to video village, okay?

55:31.185 --> 55:33.688
We're going to find a way
out of here, guys. Stay close.

55:38.391 --> 55:41.092
Okay, uh, you guys go in there,
you guys come with me.

55:41.094 --> 55:43.130
We're going to find a way
out of here. Stay close.

56:24.705 --> 56:27.038
- All right.
- Stay back.

56:27.040 --> 56:28.739
Jamie, what the hell
are you doing?

56:28.741 --> 56:30.208
Put that away.

56:30.210 --> 56:31.710
Jamie, put that away,
and help us.

56:31.712 --> 56:33.081
What are you doing?

56:37.116 --> 56:38.919
Tim?

56:45.225 --> 56:46.761
Jamie, Jamie!

56:47.795 --> 56:49.194
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

56:49.196 --> 56:51.132
We got to get him
out of here.

56:52.799 --> 56:54.398
Jamie, come on.

56:54.400 --> 56:56.367
- Get him out of here.
- Come on, come on.

56:56.369 --> 56:57.839
Come on.

57:00.007 --> 57:01.440
Tim, I can't, he's too hurt.

57:01.442 --> 57:03.108
Okay, put him down,
put him down.

57:03.110 --> 57:05.409
You got it, okay?

57:05.411 --> 57:07.982
Guys, we need your help.

57:10.384 --> 57:13.819
The lights kept going
on and off. What happened?

57:13.821 --> 57:15.089
What the hell
happened to him?

57:16.156 --> 57:18.025
Bumped into the wall.

57:19.460 --> 57:21.393
He bumped into a wall?

57:21.395 --> 57:23.728
- How many times?
- Tim, how can you not believe

57:23.730 --> 57:25.297
there's something paranormal
going on in this house

57:25.299 --> 57:27.232
after everything you've seen
with your own eyes?

57:27.234 --> 57:29.266
What I've seen with my own eyes,
is Alison nailed to the wall,

57:29.268 --> 57:31.402
and Jamie tripping in a dark
basement and bumping his head.

57:31.404 --> 57:33.337
There's nothing paranormal
happening here.

57:33.339 --> 57:35.806
Someone killed Alison,
and I'm going to find out who.

57:35.808 --> 57:38.442
Or, or, we could let
the police figure that out,

57:38.444 --> 57:40.244
and we could figure out a way
to get out of here.

57:40.246 --> 57:42.047
How come we can't open
any doors or smash any windows?

57:42.049 --> 57:43.717
What's your logical
explanation for that?

57:45.118 --> 57:47.287
Are there any symbols
on her wrists?

57:48.922 --> 57:50.355
What?

57:50.357 --> 57:52.090
Please, someone
go check to see

57:52.092 --> 57:53.525
if Alison had any symbols
on her wrist.

57:53.527 --> 57:55.994
- And film it.
- It's Alison.

57:55.996 --> 57:57.465
It's good TV.

57:59.232 --> 58:01.034
It's not like she's coming back
to life anytime soon.

58:03.136 --> 58:04.905
Fine, give me this.

58:20.253 --> 58:22.156
What is that?

58:24.090 --> 58:25.493
I don't know.

58:29.897 --> 58:31.498
Hey, what do you guys see?

58:57.491 --> 58:59.157
Same as the ones
in the Murphy house.

58:59.159 --> 59:01.492
There's nothing,
but I'll keep looking.

59:01.494 --> 59:03.195
Wait, we have Internet?

59:03.197 --> 59:05.163
No. I'm checking our
internal database.

59:05.165 --> 59:06.498
We still don't have power.

59:06.500 --> 59:08.400
I tracked the bogus
info on Wiki,

59:08.402 --> 59:11.472
and saw that his page
was updated yesterday.

59:14.440 --> 59:16.409
So who updated it?

59:17.511 --> 59:19.013
It said his wife.

59:22.516 --> 59:24.248
- Is she still alive?
- No.

59:24.250 --> 59:25.552
That would mean
she's a hundred years old.

59:26.953 --> 59:28.555
No, she's... she's dead.

59:30.190 --> 59:33.060
Mrs. Koenig died shortly
after he did, in 1935.

59:37.130 --> 59:38.566
How did she die?

59:40.366 --> 59:41.802
She was crucified.

59:44.538 --> 59:46.107
Yeah.

59:56.183 --> 59:58.052
Uh...

59:59.118 --> 01:00:00.652
Gary, what is that?

01:00:00.654 --> 01:00:02.253
I don't know, I don't know.
Uh, movement,

01:00:02.255 --> 01:00:05.090
but no corporeal bodies.

01:00:05.092 --> 01:00:08.259
The EMF's trampolining on mean,
the laser could've been tripped.

01:00:08.261 --> 01:00:10.497
It's like an army
is moving toward...

01:00:18.572 --> 01:00:19.907
Lisa!

01:00:22.576 --> 01:00:24.074
Lisa!

01:00:24.076 --> 01:00:25.979
- Oh, my God.
- Lisa?

01:00:27.581 --> 01:00:29.150
What the fuck?

01:00:37.690 --> 01:00:39.157
Fuck!

01:00:41.627 --> 01:00:44.264
No, no. No number.

01:00:48.502 --> 01:00:51.205
Um, I got movement
again upstairs.

01:00:52.105 --> 01:00:53.040
Front bedroom.

01:00:57.110 --> 01:00:59.213
They can't get you in here.

01:01:04.551 --> 01:01:06.550
Stacy, stay down here.

01:01:06.552 --> 01:01:08.085
No, that's not going to happen.

01:01:08.087 --> 01:01:10.422
Stacy!

01:01:10.424 --> 01:01:12.523
- Where's Billy?
- He's in the study.

01:01:12.525 --> 01:01:14.462
What the fuck is he doing?

01:01:29.976 --> 01:01:32.679
<i>I got movement
in the back bedroom now, too.</i>

01:01:39.386 --> 01:01:40.719
- Gary, did you get that?
- <i>What was that?</i>

01:01:40.721 --> 01:01:42.420
The door slammed shut.

01:01:42.422 --> 01:01:44.188
You didn't see
anything on video?

01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:45.590
- Negative.
- <i>Wait. I got something.</i>

01:01:45.592 --> 01:01:47.558
Where?

01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:49.293
I think it's coming from right
in front of you.

01:01:49.295 --> 01:01:51.029
There's nothing here.

01:01:51.031 --> 01:01:52.529
Maybe an echo? False reading?

01:01:52.531 --> 01:01:54.532
<i>Dude, I'm telling you,</i>

01:01:54.534 --> 01:01:55.703
<i>there's something right there
in front of you.</i>

01:01:57.670 --> 01:02:00.105
<i>It's just inside the door.</i>

01:02:00.107 --> 01:02:02.310
Yeah, we can hear it.

01:02:04.277 --> 01:02:05.947
We're going in.

01:02:08.214 --> 01:02:10.717
Three, two, one.

01:02:15.554 --> 01:02:17.524
Guys, there's nothing here.

01:02:19.058 --> 01:02:20.692
<i>No, I know, um...</i>

01:02:20.694 --> 01:02:22.326
<i>the activity is gone.</i>

01:02:22.328 --> 01:02:23.795
<i>It's just...</i>

01:02:23.797 --> 01:02:25.733
<i>it's just gone.</i>

01:02:48.721 --> 01:02:50.457
Guys, there's nothing here.

01:03:05.072 --> 01:03:06.404
Fuck.

01:03:11.110 --> 01:03:12.413
Hey.

01:03:39.572 --> 01:03:40.808
They're numbers.

01:03:44.110 --> 01:03:45.777
The symbols on their wrists,
they're numbers.

01:03:45.779 --> 01:03:47.645
It's biblical Hebrew.

01:03:47.647 --> 01:03:49.581
It looks similar to Arabic
to the untrained eye.

01:03:49.583 --> 01:03:52.052
You read right to left.
They're Hebrew numbers.

01:03:55.788 --> 01:03:57.855
Tim! Stacy!

01:03:57.857 --> 01:03:59.556
Hey!

01:03:59.558 --> 01:04:01.326
Hey!

01:04:01.328 --> 01:04:03.795
Hey! Hey!

01:04:03.797 --> 01:04:05.697
Hey!

01:04:05.699 --> 01:04:07.165
Hey!

01:04:31.290 --> 01:04:33.626
Is that Stefan?

01:05:50.904 --> 01:05:53.407
Is anybody going
to say anything?

01:06:05.918 --> 01:06:07.918
Dear God in heaven...

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:11.556
please take these sweet souls,

01:06:11.558 --> 01:06:15.793
and please show mercy
and forgiveness

01:06:15.795 --> 01:06:18.632
to the troubled souls
that took them from us.

01:06:19.498 --> 01:06:20.931
Excuse me?

01:06:20.933 --> 01:06:22.636
Troubled souls?

01:06:24.270 --> 01:06:26.536
Our friends, my friend Lisa
was murdered.

01:06:26.538 --> 01:06:29.641
Nailed to a wall
with fucking railroad spikes.

01:06:29.643 --> 01:06:31.675
We're not dealing
with troubled souls.

01:06:31.677 --> 01:06:33.744
We're dealing with
sick fucking murderers.

01:06:33.746 --> 01:06:35.646
Okay, come on,
he was just trying to...

01:06:35.648 --> 01:06:38.616
Trying to what? He's been acting
crazy since we got here.

01:06:38.618 --> 01:06:39.987
Really?

01:06:41.453 --> 01:06:42.954
I think I've been as serene

01:06:42.956 --> 01:06:44.521
as you've ever seen me,
brother Jamie.

01:06:46.025 --> 01:06:47.425
Dare I say even
turned over a new leaf.

01:06:47.427 --> 01:06:49.059
- Fuck you.
- Hey! Hey!

01:06:49.061 --> 01:06:51.998
Jamie, stop it!
Come on, man!

01:06:53.967 --> 01:06:56.500
Look, we're all fucking scared
and stressed out right now,

01:06:56.502 --> 01:06:57.835
but we need to stay calm.

01:06:57.837 --> 01:06:59.670
We're being systematically
killed off,

01:06:59.672 --> 01:07:01.605
- and you're the one...
- Okay, I that's enough.

01:07:01.607 --> 01:07:02.775
I said back off!

01:07:07.514 --> 01:07:10.417
Look, we got to
stick together guys.

01:07:11.618 --> 01:07:13.351
All right?
This is fucked up,

01:07:13.353 --> 01:07:15.619
but we can't let this warp
what we know to be true.

01:07:15.621 --> 01:07:16.956
We know each other.

01:07:19.092 --> 01:07:22.663
Stacy, do you anything
about who or what is doing this?

01:07:26.866 --> 01:07:28.668
Okay, Billy?

01:07:29.768 --> 01:07:31.369
Well, I'm with Stacy.

01:07:31.371 --> 01:07:32.969
I don't think it's human.

01:07:32.971 --> 01:07:34.971
Well, whatever it is,
it's not any of us, okay?

01:07:34.973 --> 01:07:37.108
So we just need to stop misusing
our energy and pointing fingers,

01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:39.476
and focus on what's
fucking important right now:

01:07:39.478 --> 01:07:41.012
just staying
the fuck alive, okay?

01:07:41.014 --> 01:07:43.050
Stay alive, stop misusing
our energy.

01:08:37.035 --> 01:08:38.604
How's she doing?

01:08:45.078 --> 01:08:46.546
Yeah.

01:08:58.424 --> 01:09:00.526
I wish you would've
had my back more.

01:09:05.697 --> 01:09:07.468
What are you talking about?

01:09:08.133 --> 01:09:09.703
When?

01:09:11.837 --> 01:09:13.607
In this life.

01:09:18.210 --> 01:09:20.446
Billy, come on.

01:09:21.513 --> 01:09:23.116
I'm your little brother.

01:09:25.118 --> 01:09:27.821
I've never let anything bad
happen to you. Right?

01:09:52.745 --> 01:09:54.545
Is that algorithm working?

01:09:54.547 --> 01:09:56.514
Yeah, it is,

01:09:56.516 --> 01:09:58.582
but I only have like five
minutes left of battery power.

01:09:58.584 --> 01:10:00.119
Oh, man.

01:10:00.853 --> 01:10:02.019
Billy...

01:10:02.021 --> 01:10:03.490
What?

01:10:04.757 --> 01:10:07.027
It's a total of 50,048.

01:10:08.061 --> 01:10:10.060
How do you know that?

01:10:10.062 --> 01:10:13.029
It's a total number of people
since Christ was crucified

01:10:13.031 --> 01:10:15.065
who were murdered,

01:10:15.067 --> 01:10:18.502
and have the same ancient
Hebrew numbers on their wrists,

01:10:18.504 --> 01:10:20.037
including Alison.

01:10:20.039 --> 01:10:21.706
But I thought all those
photos were classified,

01:10:21.708 --> 01:10:23.541
and had those black bars
covering them.

01:10:23.543 --> 01:10:25.576
And how about all
the people that died

01:10:25.578 --> 01:10:27.177
before cameras
even existed?

01:10:27.179 --> 01:10:29.546
I hacked into NASA
and redirected rockets

01:10:29.548 --> 01:10:31.215
when I was 14 years old.

01:10:31.217 --> 01:10:33.050
- Thought they were just droids.
- They were rockets.

01:10:33.052 --> 01:10:37.020
Wait, so 50,000 people
have been killed

01:10:37.022 --> 01:10:38.588
with the same numbers
on their wrists,

01:10:38.590 --> 01:10:40.224
and no one's
ever heard about it?

01:10:40.226 --> 01:10:42.193
In the last 2,000 years,
five billion have been murdered.

01:10:42.195 --> 01:10:44.761
Fifty-nine thousand is
one thousandth of one percent.

01:10:44.763 --> 01:10:46.530
That's less than
five people a year.

01:10:46.532 --> 01:10:47.899
That's not enough
to draw attention to it

01:10:47.901 --> 01:10:49.766
as a serial situation

01:10:49.768 --> 01:10:51.301
for either the numbers
on the wrist,

01:10:51.303 --> 01:10:53.069
or for them all
being kids of priests.

01:10:53.071 --> 01:10:56.640
God told Abraham
to sacrifice his son Isaac.

01:10:56.642 --> 01:10:58.542
When he was about to do it,
God said,

01:10:58.544 --> 01:11:00.310
"Stop, the fact that you were
willing is enough."

01:11:00.312 --> 01:11:03.713
Novum is actually doing it.

01:11:03.715 --> 01:11:06.216
Alison was 59,048.

01:11:06.218 --> 01:11:09.489
They need one more
to get to 59,049.

01:11:10.856 --> 01:11:12.323
Why is fifty thousand,
whatever,

01:11:12.325 --> 01:11:13.627
the number of people
they need to kill?

01:11:14.794 --> 01:11:16.560
It's nine to the fifth power.

01:11:16.562 --> 01:11:19.329
The Kabbalah says
that the demonic number is two,

01:11:19.331 --> 01:11:22.867
the Jehovah's number is seven,
seven and two is nine.

01:11:22.869 --> 01:11:24.301
This number keeps coming up.

01:11:24.303 --> 01:11:26.202
The ultimate demonic
number is nine.

01:11:26.204 --> 01:11:28.238
And they believe that there
are five angels of death

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:30.241
to make up
the demonic order.

01:11:30.243 --> 01:11:32.879
So, nine to the fifth power.

01:11:34.813 --> 01:11:36.646
Okay.

01:11:36.648 --> 01:11:39.520
And what does any of this
have to do with Billy?

01:11:41.254 --> 01:11:42.556
Look.

01:11:55.133 --> 01:11:56.867
Even if I could,

01:11:56.869 --> 01:11:59.540
you'd still want to bring
a baby in this world?

01:12:00.239 --> 01:12:01.842
Of course.

01:12:03.276 --> 01:12:05.178
There's so much evil.

01:12:07.146 --> 01:12:10.083
Why would you want to expose
a sweet, innocent soul to that?

01:12:11.316 --> 01:12:13.317
That's why we
absolutely must

01:12:13.319 --> 01:12:17.324
bring sweet, innocent souls
to this world.

01:12:19.392 --> 01:12:22.329
Until that's the only thing
the world knows.

01:12:23.795 --> 01:12:25.962
That's a beautiful
thing to believe.

01:12:25.964 --> 01:12:27.633
With all my heart.

01:12:29.067 --> 01:12:31.170
That's just
what I love you with.

01:12:33.071 --> 01:12:34.708
All my heart.

01:12:35.708 --> 01:12:37.210
And our little...

01:12:39.712 --> 01:12:41.679
African, or...

01:12:41.681 --> 01:12:44.314
...Chinese, or Colombian,

01:12:44.316 --> 01:12:49.155
or New Jersey-an son or daughter
will be the perfect soul for us.

01:12:57.062 --> 01:13:01.901
Well, it depends on what part
of New Jersey, but I hear you.

01:13:22.888 --> 01:13:25.355
<i>The demonic number is two.
The Jehovah's number is seven.</i>

01:13:25.357 --> 01:13:27.858
<i>Seven and two is nine.
Demonic number is two.</i>

01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:30.961
<i>The Jehovah's number is seven.
Seven and two is nine.</i>

01:13:30.963 --> 01:13:33.264
<i>The demonic number is two,
the Jehovah's number is seven.</i>

01:13:33.266 --> 01:13:35.232
<i>Seven and two is nine.</i>

01:13:35.234 --> 01:13:37.404
<i>The demonic number is two,
the Jehovah's number is seven.</i>

01:13:52.218 --> 01:13:55.385
<i>Tim, can you come here, please?</i>

01:13:55.387 --> 01:13:57.387
<i>There's something
you need to see.</i>

01:13:57.389 --> 01:13:59.860
Yeah, I'm here, Gary.

01:14:02.094 --> 01:14:03.827
<i>Can you just tell me
what it is?</i>

01:14:03.829 --> 01:14:05.796
<i>I'm kind of in the middle
of something.</i>

01:14:05.798 --> 01:14:07.832
<i>I can't.</i>

01:14:07.834 --> 01:14:09.970
<i>It's something you need
to see with your own eyes.</i>

01:14:12.405 --> 01:14:13.974
We should go.

01:14:16.075 --> 01:14:17.878
Okay, we're coming.

01:14:40.967 --> 01:14:42.469
Gary?

01:14:43.803 --> 01:14:45.435
Gary?

01:14:45.437 --> 01:14:47.039
What the... Gary?

01:14:48.441 --> 01:14:50.777
Gary?

01:14:54.513 --> 01:14:56.282
What the...?

01:15:02.187 --> 01:15:04.156
Goddamn it.

01:16:37.215 --> 01:16:39.315
Why won't you let us go?

01:16:39.317 --> 01:16:41.487
Let us out, please!

01:16:42.588 --> 01:16:43.921
What do you want from us?

01:16:43.923 --> 01:16:44.988
Oh, shit.

01:16:49.896 --> 01:16:52.496
Let us go.
Why can't you...?

01:16:52.498 --> 01:16:53.600
Why won't you let us go?

01:16:54.967 --> 01:16:56.466
No!

01:16:56.468 --> 01:16:58.034
Open!

01:16:58.036 --> 01:16:59.569
No.

01:16:59.571 --> 01:17:01.204
Stacy, Stacy, Stacy...

01:17:01.206 --> 01:17:03.274
Baby, we should be
the ones to leave.

01:17:03.276 --> 01:17:05.475
I don't understand.
I don't understand.

01:17:05.477 --> 01:17:06.609
Come here, come here.

01:17:06.611 --> 01:17:08.679
It's okay, it's okay.

01:17:08.681 --> 01:17:11.582
Come here.
It's going to be okay.

01:17:11.584 --> 01:17:14.621
We're going to be okay.
We're going to be okay.

01:17:16.588 --> 01:17:18.524
We're going to be okay.

01:18:19.651 --> 01:18:21.585
Jamie! Jamie! No!

01:18:21.587 --> 01:18:23.052
- Oh, God!
- Fucking no!

01:18:23.054 --> 01:18:25.055
I knew it was you all along.

01:18:25.057 --> 01:18:26.422
Jamie, no!
No, no, no, please.

01:18:26.424 --> 01:18:28.125
I'm going to end this now.

01:18:28.127 --> 01:18:30.094
Jamie, listen to me,
listen, listen...

01:18:30.096 --> 01:18:31.761
- Jamie, you don't understand.
- Jamie, Jamie, stop it.

01:18:31.763 --> 01:18:33.663
- Let's talk about this.
- I don't want to die.

01:18:33.665 --> 01:18:35.165
Jamie, no. No.

01:18:35.167 --> 01:18:36.669
- Jamie, it's not...
- No!

01:18:40.539 --> 01:18:42.072
- Jamie!
- Jamie!

01:18:42.074 --> 01:18:44.007
- Jamie...
- No!

01:18:44.009 --> 01:18:45.676
Jamie, Jamie...

01:18:47.413 --> 01:18:49.546
Jamie, stop it! No!

01:18:49.548 --> 01:18:51.015
- Stop it!
- Tim, pull it!

01:18:51.017 --> 01:18:52.683
I'm pulling! Stop!

01:18:54.754 --> 01:18:56.787
I can't stop it!

01:18:56.789 --> 01:18:58.488
Take me!

01:18:58.490 --> 01:18:59.725
No!

01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:03.394
- No!
- Jamie...

01:19:03.396 --> 01:19:05.595
No! No! No!

01:19:05.597 --> 01:19:06.732
Jamie!

01:19:09.802 --> 01:19:11.301
Oh, God.

01:19:11.303 --> 01:19:12.702
Jamie!

01:19:12.704 --> 01:19:14.704
- No, no, no.
- Oh, God.

01:19:14.706 --> 01:19:17.073
- No!
- Billy...

01:19:17.075 --> 01:19:19.378
Take me!

01:19:20.678 --> 01:19:22.278
- The door...
- Tim, the door.

01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:23.680
Let's go, let's go!

01:19:23.682 --> 01:19:25.482
Take me!

01:19:25.484 --> 01:19:27.350
Billy? Billy!
Billy, come on!

01:19:27.352 --> 01:19:29.619
Billy, let's go! Billy!

01:19:29.621 --> 01:19:31.488
No! No, no, no...

01:19:31.490 --> 01:19:34.394
- Billy!
- No, baby, stop!

01:19:36.495 --> 01:19:39.063
Stacy! Stacy!

01:19:39.065 --> 01:19:40.663
Stacy...

01:19:40.665 --> 01:19:41.732
Billy.

01:19:41.734 --> 01:19:43.667
No! No! No! No!

01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:45.234
Billy!

01:19:45.236 --> 01:19:47.406
Billy! Billy!

01:19:50.075 --> 01:19:51.477
Come on.

01:20:10.195 --> 01:20:11.497
Billy!

01:20:34.786 --> 01:20:36.423
Someone help!

01:20:59.812 --> 01:21:01.744
So, is she going to be okay?

01:21:01.746 --> 01:21:03.380
She's going to be fine.

01:21:03.382 --> 01:21:05.815
She has a very minor
concussion,

01:21:05.817 --> 01:21:08.417
a couple of bumps
and bruises.

01:21:08.419 --> 01:21:10.287
She was very lucky.

01:21:21.667 --> 01:21:23.369
Hey, did you know
you're pregnant?

01:21:27.539 --> 01:21:29.840
That's impossible.
I can't have children.

01:21:29.842 --> 01:21:31.942
You can,
and you're going to,

01:21:31.944 --> 01:21:34.513
and the two of you are going
to be right as rain.

01:21:42.221 --> 01:21:44.287
I mean, what do we know?

01:21:44.289 --> 01:21:46.857
Do we know if it's
a boy or a girl?

01:21:46.859 --> 01:21:48.759
It'll probably take
a couple of weeks

01:21:48.761 --> 01:21:51.397
- until we can determine the sex.
- It's a boy.

01:21:53.665 --> 01:21:55.435
How do you...
how do you know that?

01:22:02.441 --> 01:22:05.242
Well, listen,
she needs some rest.

01:22:05.244 --> 01:22:06.943
- She's been through a lot.
- Yeah.

01:22:06.945 --> 01:22:08.644
Both of you have been
through a great deal.

01:22:08.646 --> 01:22:10.747
All I can say
is congratulations,

01:22:10.749 --> 01:22:13.253
and best of luck
to both of you.
