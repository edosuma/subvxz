Hey, guys.

00:44.836 --> 00:47.305
Just watched a video
sent to me by a follower.

00:47.464 --> 00:51.935
Hey, everybody. It's Jen and I wanted
to make this video in response to...

00:52.094 --> 00:54.813
That sleep experiment video
that's on YouTube.

00:54.972 --> 00:58.272

mad scientist guy.

you know, tests.

01:01.436 --> 01:05.031

- Younger Asian male patients.

connected to their heads.

on the Internet anymore.

Welcome to this episode
of "Ask Alpha Cat."

01:13.490 --> 01:16.790
This crazy viral video that has gotten
thousands of views.

01:16.952 --> 01:18.920
Apparently, it's this viral video
that's been going around the web.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.956
- It's gotten tons of hits.
- Some people have also said

01:21.123 --> 01:24.127
that this is related to, like,
a more recent rash of deaths.

01:24.293 --> 01:27.263
Those deaths over in Kentucky.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.640
Some people say that
it's dangerous to watch it.

01:29.798 --> 01:32.017
After watching it,
they start hallucinating.

01:32.175 --> 01:34.974
It's kind of creepy. I'm not trying to
have some real-life "Ring" experience

01:35.137 --> 01:36.309
where I watch something
and then I'm cursed.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.144
- Bump that.
- It's pretty scary.

01:38.307 --> 01:39.604
People just think I'm crazy.

01:39.766 --> 01:42.565
- Obviously, this is fake, you guys.
- This is something real.

01:43.687 --> 01:45.155
This video is creepy as hell.

01:45.314 --> 01:47.863
Like, nobody knows
who uploaded the video.

01:48.025 --> 01:49.868
We have no information.
We have nothing.

01:50.027 --> 01:53.998
This is a video that wasn't
meant to get out.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.666

My name's Alex.

CHARLIE: - Hey, Alex. What's up?

05:31.540 --> 05:34.885
Well, there's this girl
and I really like her.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.387
So go up to her,
start a conversation.

05:37.546 --> 05:39.264
ALEX: We really haven't met
in person yet.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.845
We just Facebook each other,
but I thought it was starting

05:42.008 --> 05:44.056
to get intense, and then
she stopped responding.

05:44.219 --> 05:45.641
CHARLIE: I remember hearing
a story about a girl

05:45.804 --> 05:47.764
who fell in love with a guy
on one of these sites,

05:47.848 --> 05:51.022
and when she found out that the guy
was actually one of her friends

05:51.184 --> 05:53.232
playing a prank on her,
she killed herself.

05:53.395 --> 05:54.567
Now, what does that tell you?

05:54.729 --> 05:57.073
It tells me that the bullshit
we make up in our minds

05:57.232 --> 05:58.449
can be dangerous.

05:58.608 --> 06:01.031
It's got us living in a world
where we're falling in love

that animal instinct

06:12.289 --> 06:13.836

06:13.999 --> 06:16.923
And without that,
you got nothing.

06:17.085 --> 06:20.885
Just a fake relationship
with a fake girl in a fake world,

06:21.047 --> 06:23.049
with nothing to show for it
but real heartache.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.389
So turn off your computer, Alex.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.680

- What kind of things?
- Shadows.

JEFF: Did you get
the package I left you?

16:20.146 --> 16:23.491
Mm-hmm, I did, Jeff.
That is some interesting stuff.

16:23.649 --> 16:26.118
- What is it?
- I don't know.

16:26.277 --> 16:28.200
I'm trying to figure that out,

16:28.362 --> 16:31.366
but I'm afraid if I go to sleep,
I'll never wake up again.

16:31.532 --> 16:34.206
Why exactly did you send me
that package, Jeff?

16:34.368 --> 16:36.962
It's evidence.
I'm not crazy.

16:37.121 --> 16:39.670
They come when you sleep.

16:39.832 --> 16:43.086
Every night, I close my eyes
and they come.

16:44.378 --> 16:48.008
And I'll wiggle my toe
or try and move my arms

16:48.174 --> 16:51.178
just to wake myself up, but it's like
they don't want you to be awake.

16:51.344 --> 16:54.268
Mm. Well, now you're starting
to worry me, Jeff.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.728
How old are you?

16:56.891 --> 16:58.859
- 17.
- 17, I see.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.441
Are your parents around?
Can I talk to them?

17:01.604 --> 17:04.904
My mom works nights.
I'm here alone.

17:05.066 --> 17:08.411
Jeff, if you're afraid,
you should go to a friend's house

17:08.569 --> 17:11.242
- or... I don't know.
- I have a gun.

17:14.282 --> 17:16.911
Uh, what do you need a gun for?

17:17.078 --> 17:19.705
You can't get away from them.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.045
Do you understand me?

17:22.208 --> 17:23.425
It's your thoughts.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.928
When you think about them,
that's how they find you.

17:26.087 --> 17:29.011
It's like sharks drawn
to blood in water.

17:30.841 --> 17:33.811
The only question is,

17:33.970 --> 17:36.018
how do you stop thinking
about something?

17:38.933 --> 17:41.982
Uh, Jeff, are you still with us?

17:43.938 --> 17:45.940
- They're here.
- Okay.

17:46.107 --> 17:47.825
Now, uh, just...
just calm down, Jeff.

17:47.984 --> 17:50.612
I want you to call someone.

17:52.697 --> 17:53.698
Uh...

17:54.949 --> 17:57.372
Uh, let's... let's just put
that gun down

17:57.535 --> 17:59.003
and... so we can talk,
because, Jeff,

17:59.161 --> 18:01.459
I know that you are not crazy.

Yeah, we're gonna go
to a commercial break now

18:10.590 --> 18:12.308
to, uh, make sure
everything's okay.

18:12.466 --> 18:14.639
Now nobody panic.
This could be a hoax.

18:14.802 --> 18:18.852
We will find Jeff and, uh,
make sure that he is all right.

18:35.531 --> 18:38.205
They're in the room right now.
I see them in the room right now.

18:38.367 --> 18:39.968
- What... who is in the room?
- Charlie...

18:39.994 --> 18:41.621
- Who's in the room?
(GUNSHOT)

18:41.787 --> 18:43.835
Do you want me to call...
oh, my gosh.

18:43.998 --> 18:46.217
Well, I'll tell you what.
Details are very sketchy at this point.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.343
We arrived just about
a half hour ago

18:48.502 --> 18:50.300
and we're told that
the radio host here

18:50.463 --> 18:52.841
took a call from someone
right around 17 years old,

18:53.007 --> 18:55.385
and that person through
the course of the conversation

18:55.551 --> 18:57.178
is heard firing a weapon.

18:57.345 --> 18:58.767
We don't know if that person
fired a weapon,

18:58.929 --> 19:01.023
we don't know if somebody else
in the room fired a weapon,

19:01.182 --> 19:03.935
but a weapon was fired
live on the air.

19:14.070 --> 19:16.789
He didn't kill himself.
He shot the wall.

19:16.947 --> 19:19.075
His parents checked him
into a hospital.

19:19.241 --> 19:21.869
Man, that had me freaked out.

19:22.036 --> 19:23.128
Yeah, me, too.

19:23.287 --> 19:25.381
He wants to take
your statement now.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.676
Hi, Officer.

19:36.842 --> 19:39.846
People are already speculating
that the call may have been a hoax

19:40.012 --> 19:42.310
in an attempt to boost
the ratings of the show.

19:42.473 --> 19:45.852
Now, if that's true, host Charlie Crowe
may be in a bit of hot water.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.396
We tried to speak to Mr. Crowe
following the broadcast,

19:48.562 --> 19:49.842
but take a look
at what happened.

19:49.855 --> 19:52.278
I didn't call him.
He called me, all right?

19:52.441 --> 19:54.489
I've never met him.
I'm just an entertainer.

19:54.652 --> 19:58.247
Now, if you'll please excuse me,
that's all I have to say about that.

20:00.241 --> 20:03.085

on the air tomorrow?

last night with the kid,

the break that we need.

to this kind of real-life drama.

20:29.437 --> 20:30.905
No, people think it's a stunt.

20:31.063 --> 20:35.193
I had a reporter at the station
last night asking me about it.

20:35.359 --> 20:36.656
I'll tell you what it is,
it's an opportunity.

And it's got a lot of people
talking about it.

Programmers think it's a good idea
and, actually, I think so, too,

20:42.032 --> 20:44.535
if you go down to the hospital
and you talk to this kid.

20:44.702 --> 20:46.955
- You know, meet him.
- No, no.

20:47.121 --> 20:50.045
Oh, don't make me do that.
I'm not good with kids.

20:53.377 --> 20:55.755
No, no, listen. You go down
to the hospital, okay?

20:55.921 --> 20:59.095
You meet with the kid, you show
that the station is sympathetic,

20:59.258 --> 21:01.727
and it's good PR, right?

21:01.886 --> 21:04.605

pronounced dead,

from my experience,

31:14.039 --> 31:16.883
that there are a number
of different types of mental illness

31:17.042 --> 31:19.886
which could go undiagnosed
for long periods of time.

31:20.045 --> 31:21.922
The caller on the air
may have had an episode

31:22.089 --> 31:24.091
of extreme
schizophrenic paranoia.

31:24.257 --> 31:26.680
In these instances,
the victim can often see things

31:26.843 --> 31:28.470
that aren't there,
react to them.

31:28.637 --> 31:31.516
The world of the imagination
and the real world blends

31:31.681 --> 31:33.934
so that they cannot
distinguish the difference.

31:34.101 --> 31:36.354
In such a case, it's natural
that he could have believed

31:36.520 --> 31:40.070
that a man or a shadowy figure
of some kind was stalking him.

31:40.232 --> 31:43.202
It's important for your audience
to be aware that these delusions

31:43.360 --> 31:45.454
are fairly common,
but we must remember

31:45.612 --> 31:47.364
that they are only
in our imagination.

31:47.531 --> 31:49.092
And no matter how frightening
they seem,

31:49.241 --> 31:51.960
- they can't really harm you.

he might never wake up.

to go to bed.

They feel like they're suffocating,
and it's terrifying.

36:47.580 --> 36:49.253
Sleep paralysis is the experience

36:49.416 --> 36:52.670
of awakening unable to move,

36:52.836 --> 36:54.930
and it's produced by
a physiological mechanism

in the brain that's well understood.

I was paralyzed,

you don't really feel your body.

You can imagine
how freaky that is.

it was anything I wanted

to really look at for very long.

37:28.455 --> 37:29.832

how many people are coming together

37:29.998 --> 37:31.295
and discussing these things now.

37:31.458 --> 37:33.256
I'm really fascinated
by all the stories coming in.

37:33.418 --> 37:36.843
There's so many people calling in
with their experiences.

37:37.005 --> 37:38.678
The numbers keep growing.

37:38.840 --> 37:41.138
Are they all making it up?
I don't think so.

37:42.385 --> 37:45.810

can it all be real?

38:15.001 --> 38:16.753
Oh, shit.

38:33.603 --> 38:36.527
As the first EIS officer
on the scene,

38:36.689 --> 38:38.032
I went to the coroner's office

38:38.191 --> 38:41.445
and was able to examine
the second victim...

38:41.611 --> 38:43.739
a 21-year-old female.

38:48.243 --> 38:50.871
So the tissue sample
showed no pathogens?

38:51.037 --> 38:54.416
No. WHITE BLOOD CELL
COUNTS: normal.

38:54.582 --> 38:57.256
Died in her sleep
just like the first victim.

38:57.418 --> 39:00.217
Two cases like this,
two days apart.

39:01.881 --> 39:04.680
- Did the two have contact?
- Don't know.

39:06.386 --> 39:09.105
Why, the CDC think this condition
may be contagious?

39:09.264 --> 39:12.484
Well, that's what I'm here
to determine.

39:13.601 --> 39:16.400
No heart defect.
Toxicology's negative.

39:16.563 --> 39:19.942
Which is odd because the male victim
was reported to be hallucinating.

39:20.108 --> 39:23.908
- Hallucinating?
- That's what the police report said.

39:24.070 --> 39:27.244
He was checked
into the hospital

39:27.407 --> 39:30.411
where he saw, like, delusions
of shadows moving all around him.

39:30.577 --> 39:32.250
Hmm.
Strange.

39:32.412 --> 39:35.086
Maybe hallucinations
are a possible symptom.

39:35.248 --> 39:37.626
- What about brain biopsy?
- Normal.

who's possibly overweight

39:41.546 --> 39:43.765
or someone who has
high blood pressure

39:43.923 --> 39:46.096
or someone who has,
like, diabetes

39:46.259 --> 39:49.854
or just a history in their family
of stroke or heart attacks.

39:50.013 --> 39:51.890
So these victims were,
you know, young,

39:52.056 --> 39:53.899
they were completely healthy.

39:54.058 --> 39:56.106
You know,
we checked their blood,

39:56.269 --> 39:57.816
and there's nothing
in their blood that shows

39:57.979 --> 40:00.448
that they have any
fatty deposits in their heart.

40:00.607 --> 40:03.201
No history of diabetes
in the family, you know,

40:03.359 --> 40:06.488
no history of stroke,
no history of cancer.

40:06.654 --> 40:09.828

the diagnosis would be easy.

(SPEAKING BROKEN ENGLISH)

40:27.550 --> 40:28.551
MAN: Very scared?

40:29.636 --> 40:33.436
It was first noticed
in the Hmong immigrants

40:33.598 --> 40:37.102
who came from Vietnam
to the United States

40:37.268 --> 40:39.191
right after the Vietnam War.

40:39.354 --> 40:42.403
We did get a team
of microbiologists,

40:42.565 --> 40:45.444
pathologists, epidemiologists.

40:45.610 --> 40:48.784
We did blood cultures,
urine samples.

40:48.947 --> 40:52.121
We did sputum cultures,
we tested for heavy metals.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.035
The most disturbing
part of this

40:54.202 --> 40:57.797
is we did not find
a biological agent.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.549
In the archives,

40:59.707 --> 41:02.335
I found a condition

41:02.502 --> 41:06.097
called sudden unexplained
nocturnal death syndrome,

41:06.255 --> 41:10.226
and I believe that this
is very likely a resurgence.

41:10.385 --> 41:12.479
This condition

41:12.637 --> 41:15.982
had very similar circumstances

41:16.140 --> 41:19.189
to these young people who have
died here in Eastern Kentucky.

41:19.352 --> 41:21.354
Did anyone do a trip report?

41:21.521 --> 41:23.023
If I remember correctly,

41:23.189 --> 41:26.409
the first EIS officer
went on-site in 1981.

41:26.567 --> 41:30.913
Initially, we thought the disease
triggered cardiac arrest during sleep,

41:31.072 --> 41:33.325
yet more recent studies indicate

41:33.491 --> 41:36.290
that lack of oxygen to the brain
may be the cause.

41:36.452 --> 41:38.796
The victims showed
no genetic history

41:38.955 --> 41:41.879
of myocardial infarction
or sleep apnea.

41:42.041 --> 41:44.214
And we're still unclear on a cause?

41:44.377 --> 41:46.596
The data was inconclusive.

41:46.754 --> 41:49.382
It seems hundreds
of healthy immigrants

41:49.549 --> 41:51.472
just died in their sleep
without cause.

41:51.634 --> 41:53.557
One more question,
Dr. Lacombe.

41:53.720 --> 41:56.018
Does the syndrome
appear to be communicable?

41:56.180 --> 41:58.558
The truth is we really don't
have enough evidence

41:58.725 --> 42:00.773
to make a conclusion
either way.

42:00.935 --> 42:04.360
Well, I don't think that explanation
is gonna fly with the public.

42:18.077 --> 42:19.750
- Mr. Crowe?
- Yeah.

42:19.912 --> 42:21.289
Hi, I'm Sophie Lacombe.

42:21.456 --> 42:23.174
I'm with the Center
for Disease Control.

42:23.332 --> 42:25.505
I got your address
from Tom at the station.

42:25.668 --> 42:27.796
Disease control?
What kind of diseases?

42:27.962 --> 42:31.387
Well, I'm here investigating
the local deaths and their causes.

42:31.549 --> 42:34.268
It seems there may be
some new cases of a disease

42:34.427 --> 42:36.771
that we call sudden unexplained
nocturnal death syndrome.

42:36.929 --> 42:38.556
Okay, I'll save you some time.

42:38.723 --> 42:40.396
Those deaths weren't caused
by a disease.

42:40.558 --> 42:41.798
In fact, they were caused by...

42:41.934 --> 42:43.936
Shadow people?

42:48.191 --> 42:50.865
I was just brewing some coffee.

42:51.027 --> 42:52.449
- Thank you.
- You want a cup?

42:52.612 --> 42:54.114
No, thanks.

42:55.698 --> 42:57.746
Come, sit.

42:59.869 --> 43:03.590
So I'm looking for a link
between these deaths.

43:03.748 --> 43:06.251
After interviewing some people
about the victims,

43:06.417 --> 43:09.170
I was told that some of them
were listening to your radio show

43:09.337 --> 43:10.964
before they died.

43:11.130 --> 43:15.010
- Can you explain that?
- No, I can't.

43:15.176 --> 43:17.144
I'm just reporting
what people are telling me.

43:17.303 --> 43:20.398
I'm trying to give them a voice.
If anything, I'm trying to help.

43:20.556 --> 43:23.480
Well, so am I, Mr. Crowe.
That's why I'm here.

43:23.643 --> 43:27.944
You see, the victims reported
hallucinations, sleep paralysis...

43:28.106 --> 43:30.905
symptoms that you
talked about on your show.

43:31.067 --> 43:33.240
Perhaps if I could get
your call logs,

43:33.402 --> 43:35.825
I could track
the infected victims.

43:35.988 --> 43:38.868
Yeah, I'll give you anything you want,
but it's not gonna do you any good

43:38.991 --> 43:42.495
unless you realize that
what these people are seeing is real.

43:42.662 --> 43:45.586
A lot of people think just 'cause
they can't explain it scientifically

43:45.748 --> 43:49.503
that it doesn't exist, but I can
tell you that our ancestors

43:49.669 --> 43:52.263
knew about nightmares
and how harmful they are.

43:52.421 --> 43:54.515
Well, I'm certain that bad dreams
can't harm you.

43:54.674 --> 43:57.177
I'm not talking about bad dreams.
I mean nightmares.

43:57.343 --> 43:59.141
The actual word nightmare

43:59.303 --> 44:02.022
is an Old English word
that means evil spirit.

44:02.181 --> 44:03.899
A maere... M-A-E-R-E...

44:04.058 --> 44:06.937
that comes in the night
to attack its victim.

44:07.103 --> 44:09.322
Now, in modern times,
we've changed that meaning.

44:09.480 --> 44:12.199
I think we've changed it
to cover up the truth.

44:12.358 --> 44:14.360
Look, here's one.

44:16.445 --> 44:19.289
A real one.
A real nightmare.

44:21.409 --> 44:24.709
Now, every culture
documents this.

44:24.871 --> 44:27.420
The Native Americans
called it the Raven Mocker.

44:27.582 --> 44:29.710
It was a shadow that comes
to steal your soul.

44:29.876 --> 44:32.550
In the Middle East, they call it jinn,
and they believe they were created

44:32.712 --> 44:35.465
at the same time as us by God,
but to live in a different dimension.

44:35.631 --> 44:38.225
Now these are cultures
that are far older than ours,

44:38.384 --> 44:40.478
but they've all reported
the same thing

44:40.636 --> 44:42.889
from different parts
of the world for centuries.

44:43.055 --> 44:46.559
And now, for the past 100 years,
we've started to deny their existence.

44:46.726 --> 44:48.649
I think it's us
who's being naive.

44:48.811 --> 44:51.860
I think it's one of those things
you're not ever gonna truly believe...

44:52.023 --> 44:54.446
Until you see it for yourself.

44:54.609 --> 44:57.579
You got a knack for finishing
people's sentences, lady.

44:59.280 --> 45:00.748
Well, that's the point, isn't it?

45:00.907 --> 45:03.660
Seeing is believing?
Yet there's no proof of these claims.

45:03.826 --> 45:06.500
- I have proof.
- You do?

45:13.878 --> 45:15.425
These don't really
prove anything.

45:15.588 --> 45:17.716
I mean, for all I know,
it could be a hoax.

45:17.882 --> 45:21.386
That's what I thought,
but this Dr. Ravenscroft

45:21.552 --> 45:22.929
published a scientific journal.

45:23.095 --> 45:24.722
Huh. I'm gonna have to
get over to the college

45:24.889 --> 45:27.187
and talk to someone about
Ravenscroft and his research.

45:27.350 --> 45:30.729
Maybe he found something about
this disease that I don't know about.

45:30.895 --> 45:32.943
Yeah, but I keep telling you,
it's not a disease.

45:33.105 --> 45:34.903
It's more... it's like a...

45:35.066 --> 45:37.444
- Curse?
- Yeah.

45:37.610 --> 45:40.989
Like I said, lady,
you have a knack.

45:42.406 --> 45:44.283
- Bye.
- See you tonight.

45:52.208 --> 45:55.052
Professor Fisher?
Hi, Sophie Lacombe.

45:55.211 --> 45:57.714
Oh, yes, from the CDC.

45:57.880 --> 46:00.599
They told me I'd have
a visitor today.

46:00.758 --> 46:03.386
- Please.
- Thank you.

46:03.552 --> 46:05.646
What can I do for you?

46:05.805 --> 46:08.524
Well, I'm looking for some
information on Dr. Ravenscroft.

46:08.683 --> 46:11.778
Do you know where
I might find him?

46:11.936 --> 46:14.860
Resurrection Cemetery
last time I checked.

46:15.022 --> 46:16.649
Sorry.

46:16.816 --> 46:18.296
Well, I'm looking for
some information

46:18.442 --> 46:20.740
on a research study
he did in 1971.

46:20.903 --> 46:24.203
A sleep study, if I'm not mistaken,
and hallucinations.

46:24.365 --> 46:27.869
Ravenscroft was a bit
of a loose cannon back in those years.

46:28.035 --> 46:29.708
What was he researching?

46:29.870 --> 46:33.625
The story that I heard
was that he was adamant

46:33.791 --> 46:38.467
that he could prove that the mind
could influence matter.

46:38.629 --> 46:41.883
He wired

46:42.049 --> 46:46.225
several of his subjects
to a door.

46:48.222 --> 46:51.271
The goal was to use their minds
to open the door

46:51.434 --> 46:53.061
by getting them all
to concentrate

46:53.227 --> 46:56.481
on the same intention
at the same time.

46:56.647 --> 46:58.194
To do that, he had to get them

46:58.357 --> 47:01.736
to a very intense
brain wave state,

47:01.902 --> 47:05.907
a state between
wakefulness and sleep.

47:06.073 --> 47:08.622
A most intense signal.

47:08.784 --> 47:13.085
He would amplify the brain waves
among several subjects

47:13.247 --> 47:16.751
and, channeling it to the door,
he hoped to produce a result.

47:16.917 --> 47:18.760
So what happened?

47:18.919 --> 47:20.842
Well, he produced a result,

47:21.005 --> 47:23.428
but it was not the one
he intended.

47:24.675 --> 47:26.848
All of the subjects died.

47:27.011 --> 47:28.388
Really?

47:28.554 --> 47:31.057
I'd guess it was either
the equipment

47:31.223 --> 47:33.976
or the intensity
of the testing procedure

47:34.143 --> 47:36.862
that disrupted
the normal brain function.

47:37.021 --> 47:39.900
But the truth will only be
in his write-ups

47:40.066 --> 47:42.785
or any films that he may
have made of the experiment.

47:42.943 --> 47:45.537
And do you have no idea
where this material might be?

47:45.696 --> 47:48.415
He said it was too dangerous
for mankind.

47:48.574 --> 47:50.668
I'd guess he'd
have destroyed it,

47:50.826 --> 47:53.375
- except that...
- Except what?

47:53.537 --> 47:55.665
Well, you're a scientist.

47:55.831 --> 47:57.333
You know how difficult
it would be

47:57.500 --> 47:59.719
to suppress your own findings.

47:59.877 --> 48:01.470
I mean, it's what
we live for, right?

48:01.629 --> 48:03.256
He wasn't that good a scientist

48:03.422 --> 48:05.095
in terms of his methodology.

48:05.257 --> 48:08.136
In terms of his thinking,
he was incredibly creative.

48:08.302 --> 48:11.021
With what we know now, we could
look back at what he discovered

48:11.180 --> 48:14.275
and what he was working on
and maybe make better sense of it

48:14.433 --> 48:16.401
than he was able to at the time.

48:16.560 --> 48:19.780
I suspect it is lost.

48:20.815 --> 48:22.658
I think so.

48:22.817 --> 48:25.821
If he didn't destroy it,
then I think the college might have.

48:25.986 --> 48:29.832
He lived in this big old house...

48:29.990 --> 48:31.992
on the corner of Elm and Maple.

48:32.159 --> 48:35.038
I went down to the house
to see him

48:35.204 --> 48:38.083
and there was no furniture
in the house.

48:38.249 --> 48:40.297
The house was completely empty,

48:40.459 --> 48:42.336
as though the movers
had been in

48:42.503 --> 48:45.928
and cleaned it out,
yet he was still living there.

49:20.166 --> 49:21.588

49:21.750 --> 49:23.252

49:23.419 --> 49:25.513
It's just that I don't think

any murder here done after all.

then why did you declare her dead?

at first, but I do now.

- no internal disturbances.

TAITT: There's radio waves
going through this room

50:26.899 --> 50:27.946
and I can't hear them now,

50:28.108 --> 50:31.408
but if I pick up a little device
like this called a radio

50:31.570 --> 50:34.619
and I turn the knob to 28.6 FM,

50:34.782 --> 50:36.784
there's music
playing on my radio.

50:36.951 --> 50:40.125
There's so much more energy
in the atmosphere,

50:40.287 --> 50:42.710
in this... what we perceive
to be empty space.

50:42.873 --> 50:45.092
You've got what's called
the visible light spectrum,

50:45.251 --> 50:48.505
and it's, like, 5% of all
of the other waveforms

50:48.671 --> 50:50.969
that exist in
the electromagnetic spectrum.

50:51.131 --> 50:53.475
You've got Wi-Fi,

50:53.634 --> 50:56.057
radio, television, satellite...
it's all there.

50:56.220 --> 50:58.814
Well, if there were something
in your environment

50:58.973 --> 51:01.522
that had a color
that was outside

51:01.684 --> 51:04.733
of our visual range
and it stood in front of you,

51:04.895 --> 51:07.569
it wouldn't be invisible,
it would just look black.

51:07.731 --> 51:10.951

that these things can grab

51:11.110 --> 51:12.908
your favorite

56:46.612 --> 56:48.831

to die in her sleep.

All three of the deceased
were apparently healthy

and an investigation is underway

56:54.912 --> 56:56.334

strangely consistent.

it's mass hysteria.

57:10.344 --> 57:13.018
I don't know if we'd call it
hysteria or not.

This outbreak has a lot of people
pretty frightened,

as the transmission properties
of the disease are still unknown.

fishy going on.

You were right about that.

59:12.758 --> 59:16.012
He also told me
that all the test subjects died.

59:16.178 --> 59:20.228
I was wondering if Ravenscroft died
from the same experiment.

certificate says that he was cremated.

59:25.520 --> 59:27.614

- The professor told me

59:27.773 --> 59:30.822
that Ravenscroft is buried
in a cemetery near the college.

59:30.984 --> 59:34.158
If he's cremated,
then what's buried in that grave?

59:34.321 --> 59:36.641

- Give me five minutes.

01:13:05.089 --> 01:13:07.968
We're here with radio talk show
host Charlie Crowe.

01:13:08.134 --> 01:13:09.511
Okay, I'll just say it.

01:13:09.677 --> 01:13:11.725
Well, all this shadow people stuff

01:13:11.888 --> 01:13:14.141
is a pretty hard pill to swallow,
you have to admit.

01:13:14.307 --> 01:13:15.354
CHARLIE:
Uh, yeah, I know.

01:13:15.516 --> 01:13:17.484
But we're told you say
you have proof of them.

01:13:17.643 --> 01:13:18.986
Is that right?

01:13:19.145 --> 01:13:22.024

- We are live.
- Uh, yes. Ahem.

01:13:35.286 --> 01:13:40.042
The proof I have
of the shadow people...

01:13:41.167 --> 01:13:42.214
is...

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:53.892
that...

01:13:55.556 --> 01:13:56.557
there is no proof.

Um...

01:13:59.018 --> 01:14:00.736
this is all an elaborate hoax.

01:14:00.895 --> 01:14:04.525
It's a... a stunt I pulled
at the station.

01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:05.691
It's a ratings stunt.

01:14:05.858 --> 01:14:09.203
I... I should apologize
to everyone.

01:14:09.362 --> 01:14:11.660
I'm very sorry.
This is a huge mistake.

01:14:11.822 --> 01:14:14.871
So you're admitting on live TV
that this is all a hoax

01:14:15.034 --> 01:14:16.911
and there are no shadow people?

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:21.374
Are you worried how this might
adversely affect your career, Mr. Crowe?

01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:22.940
I'm not sure,
to be honest with you,

01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:24.802
if it was a great idea
to even be here today.

01:14:24.877 --> 01:14:26.845

Did you leave
on your own accord

LACOMBE:
In the '70s and '80s,

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:57.637
these conditions
were relatively self-limiting

01:15:57.803 --> 01:15:59.476
by the lack of media.

01:15:59.638 --> 01:16:01.640
They were limited by the lack
of communication.

01:16:01.807 --> 01:16:06.313
And now with globalization
of social media, Internet, e-mail...

01:16:06.479 --> 01:16:11.201
that sharing this information
would cause a public health risk.

01:16:11.358 --> 01:16:13.326
My strong recommendation

01:16:13.486 --> 01:16:16.456
is that we keep
this information sealed

01:16:16.614 --> 01:16:19.834
until further research
can be done.

about having any evidence

01:16:32.505 --> 01:16:35.008
or are you just
keeping that to yourself

not to answer, Counsel?

not to answer that.
