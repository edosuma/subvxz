What's the other shoe?

10:30.325 --> 10:32.109
His assistant suggested

10:32.153 --> 10:34.677
that if you have questions
about the press passes,

10:34.721 --> 10:38.289
you should talk to
the attorney general about it.

10:44.818 --> 10:47.429

10:47.472 --> 10:51.215
Victim is Sophia Vasquez,
24, from Sheepshead Bay.

10:51.259 --> 10:53.522
Apparent suffocation with a bag,

10:53.565 --> 10:55.437
and hands tied behind her back.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.787
Which is his M.O.

10:57.831 --> 10:59.136
Look, I don't get it.

10:59.180 --> 11:00.311
Y-You guys have his house,
you have his mother

11:00.355 --> 11:01.704
murdered in the same manner.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.358
How have we not identified him?

11:04.141 --> 11:05.534
It wasn't his house.

11:05.577 --> 11:06.753
And she wasn't his mother.

11:06.796 --> 11:08.493
I thought he lived there
with his mother.

11:08.537 --> 11:10.800
Well, according to the M.E.,
she never gave birth.

11:10.844 --> 11:12.846
So, what do you have
on this guy?

11:13.803 --> 11:16.850
We have a description of the guyfrom the two officers

11:16.893 --> 11:18.590
who came to get us
from the basement.

11:18.634 --> 11:20.331
Oh, come on, there were
no prints in the house?

11:20.375 --> 11:21.942
There were prints in the house,
and we got them,

11:21.985 --> 11:23.508
but they don't match anyone
in the system.

11:23.552 --> 11:24.858
So the question is,

11:24.901 --> 11:26.424
how has he been able to float
under the radar?

11:26.468 --> 11:27.991
Obviously, this guy's good
at what he does.

11:28.035 --> 11:29.732
I mean, obviously.
He was able to trap

11:29.776 --> 11:31.560

in a basement, right?

11:32.648 --> 11:34.519

supposed to mean?

Vasquez's autopsy just came in.

11:58.892 --> 12:00.371
You know, to be honest,

12:00.415 --> 12:01.764

M.E.'s office.

The one who arrested
the reporter.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.385
Yes, it was.

12:57.428 --> 12:59.604
Tell him that if he has
questions about it,

12:59.648 --> 13:01.041
he should call me.

13:01.084 --> 13:02.738
Great.

13:04.522 --> 13:06.350
They all have damaged larynx,

13:06.394 --> 13:09.440
consistent with being
in a choke hold

13:09.484 --> 13:11.051
before they're
smothered.

13:11.094 --> 13:12.313
Okay, hold on.

13:12.356 --> 13:14.445
So, he comes from behind them
and chokes them

13:14.489 --> 13:15.795
before he uses the bag?

13:15.838 --> 13:17.971
Until they are semiconscious.

13:18.014 --> 13:19.973
And then he uses the bag
to cut off air.

13:20.016 --> 13:21.757
Judging by the
defense wounds,

13:21.801 --> 13:25.282
they try to fight him off
as he chokes them to death.

13:25.326 --> 13:26.544
Slowly.

13:36.119 --> 13:37.512
He had sex with her?

13:37.555 --> 13:39.644
It looks
like it, yes.

13:39.688 --> 13:41.429
Well, that's consistent
with his M.O.

13:41.472 --> 13:42.473

three victims.

And no one

14:00.404 --> 14:02.667
Because the victims
are runaways, sex workers...

to investigate.

He was more than a boyfriend.

19:03.490 --> 19:05.144
He's late.

19:05.187 --> 19:06.493
He's gonna show up.

19:06.536 --> 19:08.451
What makes
you so sure?He needs his fix.

19:08.495 --> 19:10.192
RAINES:
It's been half an hour.

19:10.236 --> 19:11.367
He'll show.

19:11.411 --> 19:12.629
Okay?
Let's give it a minute.

19:12.673 --> 19:15.154
We got someone
approaching the van.

19:15.197 --> 19:16.155
What?

19:16.198 --> 19:17.460
Who is it?

19:19.332 --> 19:20.855
[pounding on van]

19:20.898 --> 19:22.900
Hey. Get rid of him.

19:28.297 --> 19:29.603
Who the hell are you?Some guy gave me

19:29.646 --> 19:31.039
20 bucks to deliver this pizza.

19:31.082 --> 19:32.693
What guy?I don't know.

19:32.736 --> 19:34.825
What'd he look like?I don't know.
Like a regular dude.

19:34.869 --> 19:36.262
You got the sketch?

19:37.959 --> 19:39.569
He look like this?I don't know.

19:39.613 --> 19:40.831
He was wearing a hat.

19:40.875 --> 19:42.181
Where'd he go?

19:42.224 --> 19:44.270
I don't know. He left a note.

19:46.446 --> 19:49.449
"You won't catch me.
Enjoy your night."

19:52.582 --> 19:54.149
[sighs]

19:54.193 --> 19:55.237
[elevator bell dings]

19:55.281 --> 19:57.108
If you decide
to testify again,

19:57.152 --> 19:59.023
the next step would be
going to the grand j...

19:59.067 --> 20:01.374
Oh, my. Mrs. Washington,
I'm so sorry.

20:01.417 --> 20:02.940
I didn't realize Keisha...Keisha, why don't we

20:02.984 --> 20:04.115
go to
my office?Please, Keisha.

20:04.159 --> 20:06.074
Do you know who killed Tory?

20:06.117 --> 20:07.815
Mrs. Washington...

20:07.858 --> 20:09.947
Do you?

20:09.991 --> 20:10.948
You were with him,

20:10.992 --> 20:12.298
you saw...

20:12.341 --> 20:14.256
He would've done
anything for you,

20:14.300 --> 20:15.866
and you're just goingto let his killer go free?Keisha, please.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.346
Let's go to my office.Why, Keisha?!

20:22.830 --> 20:24.135
You did that on purpose.

20:24.179 --> 20:26.137
Excuse me?You orchestrated

20:26.181 --> 20:28.096
the whole thing--
that Tory's mother would

20:28.139 --> 20:29.445
bump right into Keisha.

20:29.489 --> 20:31.099
So what if I did?

20:31.142 --> 20:34.102
What happened to playing
everything by the book?

20:34.145 --> 20:36.800
If Keisha is willing
to let a murderer go free,

20:36.844 --> 20:39.890
she should be forced to look
at the repercussions of that.

20:39.934 --> 20:41.109
I disagree.

20:41.152 --> 20:42.980
Well, I don't look at things

20:43.024 --> 20:44.460
from the Reagan perspective.

20:44.504 --> 20:46.332
And what does that mean?

20:46.375 --> 20:49.248
You and your family know
exactly how the system works

20:49.291 --> 20:51.641
and you use it
in your favor all the time.

20:51.685 --> 20:54.122
And what exactly does
my family have to do

20:54.165 --> 20:55.645
with anything
that just happened?

20:55.689 --> 20:58.169
Your brothers have an E-ZPass
right to your door.

20:58.213 --> 20:59.867
Since when is it wrong

20:59.910 --> 21:01.695
that NYPD officers
and detectives

21:01.738 --> 21:02.826
come up to this floor?

21:02.870 --> 21:04.828
When you consistently intercede

21:04.872 --> 21:06.352
and interfere on their behalf.

21:06.395 --> 21:09.311
All within my legal
and ethical limits.

21:09.355 --> 21:11.182
I didn't say it was illegal.No, but you're implying

21:11.226 --> 21:13.272
that my family is operating

21:13.315 --> 21:15.012
in some sort of corrupt manner.

21:15.056 --> 21:17.406
Not corrupt, just convenient.

21:17.450 --> 21:19.843
Why don't you just say
what you need to say.

21:19.887 --> 21:21.497
Get it off your chest.

21:21.541 --> 21:23.891
I think I just did.

21:31.072 --> 21:32.639
Police Commissioner Reagan.

21:32.682 --> 21:34.945
Thank you.

21:35.729 --> 21:37.948
[sighs]

21:45.652 --> 21:48.089
Boy...

21:48.132 --> 21:51.048
you got your hand on every scale
in town, don't you?

21:51.092 --> 21:52.702
Careful there.

21:52.746 --> 21:54.748
Well, you got the charges
against her dropped.

21:54.791 --> 21:55.879
What would you call it?

21:55.923 --> 21:57.185
I went to you first

21:57.228 --> 21:58.882
and you literally
showed me the door.

21:58.926 --> 22:03.147
So you strong-armed the mayor
into taking away our oversight?

22:03.191 --> 22:05.715
You are wasting a lot
of capital on this.

22:05.759 --> 22:08.718
Not wasting, gladly spending,
which is my prerogative.

22:08.762 --> 22:12.766
When a reporter inserts
herself into a crime scene,

22:12.809 --> 22:14.594
it puts my cops at risk.

22:14.637 --> 22:16.073
Well, maybe you should
look at it

22:16.117 --> 22:17.771
as a way to protect your cops,

22:17.814 --> 22:19.729
if they have nothing to hide.

22:20.513 --> 22:25.387
Your reporter was on the scene
of another looting incident.

22:25.431 --> 22:28.782
The store owner
was shot in the chest.

22:28.825 --> 22:30.697
Did she shoot him?

22:33.134 --> 22:36.093
Then she had every right
to be there.

22:36.137 --> 22:38.095
A piece of advice?

22:38.139 --> 22:40.576
[sighs]

22:40.620 --> 22:42.883
I'm good, thanks.

22:42.926 --> 22:44.972
You and your cops
are under siege

22:45.015 --> 22:47.191
from all sides, I get that.

22:47.235 --> 22:51.108
But the press, they're just
the messenger in this,

22:51.152 --> 22:52.588
and you don't kill
the messenger.

22:52.632 --> 22:55.243
That's exactly what I'm trying
to avoid happening.

22:55.286 --> 22:57.114
So you want the right
to arrest reporters

22:57.158 --> 22:58.159
for their own good?Oh, please.

22:58.202 --> 23:00.901
Well, it walks like a duck.

23:00.944 --> 23:02.598
[chuckles softly]

23:02.642 --> 23:04.295
You know what's missing
in all this,

23:04.339 --> 23:06.602
besides common sense?

23:06.646 --> 23:07.995
The petition.

23:08.038 --> 23:10.476
What petition?
The one where
the major newspapers

23:10.519 --> 23:13.479
and media outlets sign up
a bunch of prominent names

23:13.522 --> 23:15.698
and drop 'em on my doorstep.
That one.

23:15.742 --> 23:17.570
I don't know anything
about a petition.

23:17.613 --> 23:18.788
Yeah, you do.

23:18.832 --> 23:21.487
There is always one
in beefs like this.

23:21.530 --> 23:23.271
Well, you're wrong this time.

23:23.314 --> 23:25.708
Or... I'm right

23:25.752 --> 23:29.146
and they couldn't get
any real reporters to sign it.

23:29.190 --> 23:30.844
Or, wishful thinking.

23:30.887 --> 23:32.454
Maybe.

23:32.498 --> 23:34.064
See, people know there's a risk

23:34.108 --> 23:36.153
in going on record
for the police,

23:36.197 --> 23:39.243
so maybe staying
on the sidelines

23:39.287 --> 23:42.290
is the new sign of support.

23:42.333 --> 23:44.074
And a piece of advice?

23:44.118 --> 23:46.163
I'm good, thanks.

23:46.207 --> 23:48.165
[sighs]

23:48.209 --> 23:51.430
Remind yourself
whose side you're on.

24:02.092 --> 24:03.050
Officer Reagan?

24:03.093 --> 24:04.486
How is the shop owner?

24:04.530 --> 24:06.314
Louis Trattner.

24:06.357 --> 24:08.185
His name's Louis Trattner.

24:08.229 --> 24:10.492
Okay. How is Mr. Trattner?

24:10.536 --> 24:13.364
He's in critical condition,
with a ruptured spleen,

24:13.408 --> 24:15.889
and a bullet lodged
near his vertebrae.

24:18.413 --> 24:20.023
It's not my fault he was shot.

24:20.067 --> 24:21.590
You got there before us again.

24:21.634 --> 24:23.549
Okay, so now I'm at fault
for being resourceful?

24:23.592 --> 24:25.507
Did you get a heads-up that
they were going to hit again?

24:25.551 --> 24:27.378
I don't have
to tell you anything.

24:27.422 --> 24:29.990
Did you get 'em on tape,
with your phone?

24:30.033 --> 24:31.034
Did you get a good look
at any of them?

24:31.078 --> 24:31.905
Know who any of them are?

24:31.948 --> 24:33.776
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

24:33.820 --> 24:35.430
I forgot...

24:35.474 --> 24:37.476
you only help the criminals.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.042
It's not my job
to arrest criminals.

24:39.086 --> 24:40.609
My job is to get stories.

24:40.653 --> 24:42.306
Good to know. I'm glad
Mr. Trattner could provide you

24:42.350 --> 24:44.004
with an exciting story.

24:47.224 --> 24:49.488
I just don't understand
why we can't subpoena her phone.

24:49.531 --> 24:51.141
You can if you have proof

24:51.185 --> 24:53.840
that she taped the shooting
on her phone, which you don't.

24:53.883 --> 24:56.233
And since when are we doing
official police business

24:56.277 --> 24:58.192
at the family dinner?

24:58.235 --> 24:59.236
Like, every week.

24:59.280 --> 25:01.021
We discuss police business,

25:01.064 --> 25:03.502
we do not conduct it--
there's a difference, wise guy.

25:03.545 --> 25:06.200
And I'm with Jamie
on this one.
Me, too.

25:06.243 --> 25:08.071
Well, no one asked you. Or you.

25:08.115 --> 25:09.508
Well.
Okay.

25:09.551 --> 25:11.248
Guess you're not interested
in my opinion.

25:11.292 --> 25:13.599
I'm sure it's the same
as every other cop at
this table, Pop.

25:13.642 --> 25:16.427
I've seen a lot of her
stuff. She really tries to
make you guys look bad.

25:16.471 --> 25:18.560
Tries to or succeeds
at doing so?

25:18.604 --> 25:20.301
Does it matter?Yeah, it matters.

25:20.344 --> 25:22.216
Half the kids at school
think that all cops are bad.

25:22.259 --> 25:24.000
Exactly.That's what happens

25:24.044 --> 25:26.612
when a reporter slants
the story and the listener

25:26.655 --> 25:29.528
can't be bothered
to seek out the other side.

25:29.571 --> 25:30.964
You mean, the other slant?

25:31.007 --> 25:32.531
FRANK:
Yeah, I guess I do.

25:32.574 --> 25:34.837
But look, it takes twice
the time and energy

25:34.881 --> 25:37.579
just to find out
the simple truth.

25:37.623 --> 25:40.234
But my partner got
shero headlines

25:40.277 --> 25:43.193
when she took that guy out
and that was the whole story.

25:43.237 --> 25:45.544
And Joe practically
got the cover of People.

25:45.587 --> 25:46.849
Well, he deserved it.

25:46.893 --> 25:48.155
What else could they
have written

25:48.198 --> 25:49.373
about him after what he did?

25:49.417 --> 25:51.071
Yeah, how could you
put a negative slant

25:51.114 --> 25:52.768
on saving a kid
from a kidnapping?

25:52.812 --> 25:56.555
I'm just saying not all
of our press is bad.

25:56.598 --> 25:58.034
And you're right,
but a Diane Butler

25:58.078 --> 26:00.559
isn't gonna cover Joe's story,
or Witten's story.

26:00.602 --> 26:02.125
It goes against her agenda.

26:02.169 --> 26:04.780
Which is a hundred percentanti-cop.
Exactly.

26:04.824 --> 26:06.652
So what?
I should give you the subpoena

26:06.695 --> 26:08.523
because she's anti-cop?

26:08.567 --> 26:10.481
You do realize
that's against the law.

26:10.525 --> 26:14.398
Maybe we should just go back
to hating lawyers instead.

26:14.442 --> 26:15.748
ERIN:
Thanks, Pop.

26:15.791 --> 26:18.533
I'll have you know,
my boss already hates me

26:18.577 --> 26:21.710
because she thinks I play
favoritism to all of you.

26:21.754 --> 26:23.538
DANNY: Oh.There's a fat chance of that.

26:23.582 --> 26:24.713
Excuse me?

26:24.757 --> 26:26.106
I called you for help
and you blew me off.

26:26.149 --> 26:27.542
The D.A.'s office is not
gonna prosecute a reporter

26:27.586 --> 26:29.979
unless the charges
are egregious.

26:30.023 --> 26:31.633
She touched evidence, Erin.

26:31.677 --> 26:33.722
Not a case I'd like to try
for a first-time offender.

26:33.766 --> 26:38.509
And if the store owner
who was shot was Pop?

26:40.163 --> 26:42.775
So who's slanted now?

26:42.818 --> 26:44.211
I'm just sayin'.

26:44.254 --> 26:46.039
Yeah, that puts it
in perspective.
Yep.

26:46.082 --> 26:48.041
But don't worry, I get it.
I won't come by to hear "no"

26:48.084 --> 26:49.869
from you any time soon.Same here.

26:49.912 --> 26:52.915
Well, great. Then I'll have
time for my own damn cases.

26:52.959 --> 26:54.656
Good.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.092
Then it's settled.

26:56.136 --> 26:57.703
[sighs]

26:57.746 --> 27:00.096
♪

27:08.278 --> 27:09.715
Thank you.

27:13.414 --> 27:15.721
If I'm being honest,
Danny and Jamie

27:15.764 --> 27:17.026
are getting all too comfortable

27:17.070 --> 27:19.463
coming up to my office
and demanding favors.

27:19.507 --> 27:20.943
Well, if you're still
being honest,

27:20.987 --> 27:23.424
do you really think you would
skirt the law

27:23.467 --> 27:24.730
to give them what they want?

27:24.773 --> 27:26.949
Never.
Well, there you go.

27:26.993 --> 27:29.169
But my boss
doesn't see it that way.

27:29.212 --> 27:33.782
She thinks that I view all
my cases skewed by my family.

27:33.826 --> 27:35.218
Well, she may be right.

27:35.262 --> 27:36.567
Well, gee, thanks, Dad.

27:36.611 --> 27:38.744
Well, I mean, look.

27:38.787 --> 27:40.354
We're all products
of our environment

27:40.397 --> 27:41.747
to a certain extent.

27:41.790 --> 27:43.879
Ours has always been
one of mutual support.

27:43.923 --> 27:47.187
Well, there is such a thing
as abusing the privilege.

27:48.710 --> 27:49.885
[chuckles softly]

27:49.929 --> 27:51.539
You want me to talk to them?

27:51.582 --> 27:53.019
No.

27:53.062 --> 27:55.674
Take them out to the woodshed?

27:55.717 --> 27:58.024
We don't have a woodshed.

28:01.767 --> 28:04.465
How do you feel
about being overlooked?

28:04.508 --> 28:06.554
I wasn't overlooked.

28:06.597 --> 28:07.947
I wasn't chosen.

28:07.990 --> 28:10.210
There's a lawyered answer.

28:12.778 --> 28:14.475
I don't know.

28:14.518 --> 28:17.608
You know...

28:17.652 --> 28:21.003
she may feel she has
to prove herself to you.

28:21.047 --> 28:23.223
Why would she?

28:23.266 --> 28:28.837

in front of your new boss.

41:50.333 --> 41:52.379
Sorry for giving you
such a hard time.

41:52.422 --> 41:54.642
Won't happen again.

41:56.165 --> 41:58.516
Yes, it will.

42:01.693 --> 42:04.086
Okay, well, I promise to be
less like him about it.

42:04.130 --> 42:07.873
Thanks.Only room for one of those
in the family.

42:10.353 --> 42:13.574
Crawford thinks
our family has a monopoly

42:13.618 --> 42:16.185
on the justice system.

42:18.144 --> 42:22.322
Really? Why don't we give
ourselves a raise then.

42:24.063 --> 42:25.673
And a family compound.

42:26.500 --> 42:29.547
I'll be sure and work on that.
