23:53.832 --> 23:55.599
              I hope Dr. Bellows
              will be all right.

23:55.634 --> 23:56.867
    He may be all right now,

23:56.902 --> 23:59.369
        but he won't be
  when I get through with him.

[SIGHS]
  Oh.

24:02.507 --> 24:04.875
That was the narrowest escape
I ever had in my whole life.

24:04.910 --> 24:06.877
    How can you tell Dr. Bellows
           about Jeannie?

24:06.912 --> 24:08.211
             How can you do that
                 to me, huh?

24:08.246 --> 24:10.246
  Me going around?
You're the one who--
                         Shh.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.448
          I am ready.

24:11.483 --> 24:12.582
                 Ready for what?

24:13.319 --> 24:14.285
        To get married.

24:14.320 --> 24:15.519
     The judge is waiting.

24:15.554 --> 24:17.187
              Wh-- D-- Married?

24:17.223 --> 24:18.755
         We've been through
          all this before.

24:18.791 --> 24:21.057
  I can't marry you, Jeannie.
        You're a genie.

24:21.093 --> 24:22.459
Well, he's
his old self again.

24:22.495 --> 24:24.227
      I want his new self.

24:24.263 --> 24:25.729
 Forget about that wedding, huh?

24:25.765 --> 24:27.031
    Just-- Just forget about it.

24:28.434 --> 24:29.499
         You are sure?

24:29.535 --> 24:31.035
        Yeah, positive.
