WEBVTT

00:05.501 --> 00:07.127
Last call.

00:07.296 --> 00:11.295
- Will you wake Norm?
- lt's not necessary.

00:13.345 --> 00:15.423
One more and l'm a memory.

00:15.599 --> 00:20.179
- Coming right up.
- How long was l asleep?

00:20.355 --> 00:24.402
Couple of hours. You dropped off
during Cliff's travelogue.

00:24.570 --> 00:29.233
Lucky you. Any subject
you bring up, he uses as an opening.

00:29.410 --> 00:34.833
At least before he went to Florida
he was boring on a wide range of topics.

00:35.001 --> 00:38.371
- Cool it, he's coming.
- Don't you say anything.

00:38.547 --> 00:42.416
Hey, look at this. He is risen.

00:42.594 --> 00:46.760
He was snoring away for quite
a while there, wasn't he, Carla?

00:48.479 --> 00:51.099
Well, another day shot.

00:51.273 --> 00:54.940
l'll slip off to the <i>hciend</i>
and close the peepers.

00:55.112 --> 00:58.482
- Good night.
- Later.

00:58.659 --> 01:03.239
lt's not really later in Florida.
lt's a popular misconception.

01:03.415 --> 01:07.580
lt's Eastern Standard Daylight Time
down there, too.

01:07.755 --> 01:11.457
Speaking of time,
it stops still in the Everglades.

01:11.635 --> 01:17.225
They have huge gators. That's what
those familiar with Florida call alligators.

01:17.393 --> 01:20.977
They have huge gators and crocs.
You know what a croc is?

01:21.148 --> 01:24.103
Oh, yeah.

01:24.277 --> 01:27.564
The first morning there was crystalline.

01:27.741 --> 01:32.285
As l stepped out of the hydrofoil,
the captain, Billy Bob Dupre,

01:32.455 --> 01:37.962
asked me not to bring the beach
umbrella. lt got caught in the prop...

01:39.000 --> 01:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:51.440 --> 02:56.899
- Hi, l'm here. Better late than never.
- That wouldn't be my choice.

02:57.866 --> 03:02.446
- Sorry, Sam. Traffic was awful.
- That's OK. What have we got here?

03:02.622 --> 03:07.784
Just some things...some things
you forgot a few months ago.

03:07.963 --> 03:12.045
To be opened later
privately and very discretely.

03:13.095 --> 03:15.588
My pants!

03:15.766 --> 03:19.183
Where did you find them,
in your bedroom?

03:19.354 --> 03:23.519
A little louder for the people
in the Ukraine who didn't hear.

03:23.693 --> 03:29.236
There's more. How did you get
along without your Snoopy toothbrush?

03:29.410 --> 03:32.661
Nice, Sammy.

03:32.831 --> 03:36.165
Mr Tooth Decay
better watch out now, Sam.

03:38.297 --> 03:42.593
Four out of five dentists
rate this right at the top.

03:42.762 --> 03:47.640
l trust you'll return the favour.
l may have left things at your place.

03:47.811 --> 03:51.430
- l'm sure l left my beige sweater.
- No problem.

03:51.607 --> 03:54.894
But you can keep
that hand puppet you loved.

03:55.070 --> 03:58.773
- Hand puppet?
- Yes, Brian the Lion.

03:58.951 --> 04:03.081
Oh, yeah. Brian the Lion.

04:03.249 --> 04:07.081
You were touched that l gave you
something from my childhood.

04:07.254 --> 04:10.755
Yes, extremely. l'll give you
five bucks to run out right now.

04:10.926 --> 04:13.383
- You got it.
- No, take this...

04:16.600 --> 04:17.845
Brian?

04:19.396 --> 04:24.226
By golly, in this light,
it does look a little bit like Brian.

04:25.279 --> 04:28.649
Brian the Lion, a bar rag?

04:32.623 --> 04:38.711
You are the most insensitive boob
l have had the misfortune to run across.

04:38.881 --> 04:42.583
lt wasn't meant to work out
between me and Brian.

04:42.761 --> 04:44.969
l wasn't cut out to be a puppeteer.

04:45.140 --> 04:50.517
That's got to be a tough thing
for a man to admit in public.

04:50.690 --> 04:52.979
Oh, come on.

04:53.152 --> 04:58.230
Come on, please, Diane.
Don't be mad at me. Please?

04:58.409 --> 05:00.616
- Well...
- Please?

05:00.787 --> 05:05.699
- l guess l'm overreacting.
- Good, then how about a little kiss?

05:07.588 --> 05:11.837
- OK.
- And put some tongue in it.

05:18.102 --> 05:23.526
That'll be five bucks for my mad dash.
What was that all about?

05:23.694 --> 05:27.906
Brian the Lion
was my dearest childhood pal.

05:28.075 --> 05:32.620
Then being a grimy bar rag
should be a step up.

05:55.362 --> 05:59.992
lt's a fact the word ''Florida''
comes from Okefenokee lndians

06:00.162 --> 06:03.828
and means ''place where
the old people come to sweat''.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.043
Sam, did you see the lady
there in the green dress?

06:09.215 --> 06:12.466
- l'm going to marry her.
- Marry her?

06:12.637 --> 06:14.677
l'm going to marry her.

06:14.848 --> 06:18.431
- What's her name?
- l don't know. lt doesn't matter.

06:18.602 --> 06:21.724
lt's what we ltalians
call ''the thunderbolt''.

06:21.899 --> 06:26.113
The same thing happened
when l first laid eyes on my Angela.

06:26.281 --> 06:30.909
- Aren't you jumping the gun a little?
- Honest, l know what l know.

06:31.079 --> 06:35.030
Norm, do you think l should go
and introduce myself?

06:35.210 --> 06:40.917
l think it's best. lt eliminates
that awkward first meeting at the altar.

06:41.970 --> 06:47.678
Coach, that is the most romantic thing
l have ever heard in this bar.

06:47.853 --> 06:50.344
- Thank you, Diane.
- Wait.

06:50.522 --> 06:55.353
What about when l invited you
to my nude limbo party?

06:55.530 --> 06:59.694
- Christmas Eve was a bad time for it.
- Maybe so.

06:59.868 --> 07:03.739
Trouble is, you're a little
outnumbered over there.

07:03.917 --> 07:08.081
You need somebody
to run interference with her friend.

07:08.255 --> 07:11.341
You're right.
Sam, would you go with me?

07:11.510 --> 07:14.547
Sam would have been my pick.

07:14.723 --> 07:16.847
Coach, l'm going to be blunt.

07:17.018 --> 07:20.602
Her friend's cute,
but isn't what l'm looking for.

07:20.773 --> 07:24.143
What's that, breakaway clothes?

07:24.320 --> 07:29.280
No, she just looks a little
too tame for me, that's all.

07:29.452 --> 07:33.368
Look at it from my point of view.
l only have so many nights.

07:33.541 --> 07:36.994
l'd trade all of mine for one of yours.

07:37.171 --> 07:42.333
- No, you wouldn't.
- Oh, yes. l'd throw in my left lung, too.

07:43.388 --> 07:45.797
Would you please come with me?

07:45.975 --> 07:51.054
- Boy, the things l do for you, Coach.
- Thank you, Sam.

07:51.233 --> 07:54.437
l haven't done this
in such a long time.

07:54.612 --> 07:58.196
My hands are sweating.
Thank you, Sam.

08:03.415 --> 08:07.879
l'll tell you what you used
to tell me when l was nervous.

08:08.048 --> 08:10.754
- What?
- Blow it and l don't know you.

08:10.927 --> 08:15.755
l should have written
some of those things down. Let's go.

08:16.852 --> 08:21.978
Good evening. My name's Sam Malone
and this is my friend, Ernie Pantusso.

08:22.150 --> 08:24.559
You can call him Coach.

08:24.737 --> 08:29.650
We were wondering if you ladies
could settle a bet for us.

08:29.827 --> 08:32.865
Are you two sisters?

08:33.041 --> 08:38.712
My name's lrene Blanchard
and this is my daughter, Sue Blanchard.

08:38.881 --> 08:42.501
- How are you?
- lt's a pleasure to meet you.

08:44.556 --> 08:48.222
We don't mean to intrude.
Are you waiting for your husbands?

08:48.395 --> 08:51.313
No, neither of us is married.

08:51.483 --> 08:54.437
Well, l'll see what l can do about that.

08:54.611 --> 08:59.952
- Would you care to join us?
- Well, thank you, why not?

09:00.161 --> 09:04.707
- Are you out on the town?
- No, we dropped by to rob the place.

09:04.877 --> 09:08.827
Everybody do as they say
and nobody will get hurt!

09:09.006 --> 09:10.882
That was a joke.

09:11.052 --> 09:16.510
l really enjoy a sense of humour.
With me it's an absolute must.

09:16.684 --> 09:19.306
ls that a player piano over there?

09:26.907 --> 09:29.446
Coach, that was not a joke.

09:29.619 --> 09:34.033
Well, l like a serious side
to someone, too.

09:34.208 --> 09:38.788
- Yes, that is a player piano.
- Would you like to see it?

09:38.965 --> 09:41.801
l haven't seen one
since l was a teenager.

09:41.969 --> 09:46.717
- When was that, last summer?
- Mr Pantusso, you're a sly one.

09:46.893 --> 09:50.844
l could think you were trying
to steal my heart.

09:51.023 --> 09:53.895
l'd rather have it given to me.
Come on.

09:57.116 --> 10:02.575
- l'm not going too fast for you, am l?
- No. l'm just waiting for an opening.

10:02.749 --> 10:06.664
Opening?
You could drive a truck through this one.

10:08.173 --> 10:13.085
Well, here we are... Man, woman.

10:13.262 --> 10:17.891
Cool evening breeze, full moon.
Need l say more?

10:18.061 --> 10:22.310
Only if you want me to know
what you're talking about.

10:22.484 --> 10:28.073
Sorry, that was my cute way
of inviting you to an evening of romance.

10:30.245 --> 10:34.114
Well, that's a very tempting offer, but...

10:34.292 --> 10:37.497
Mother and l
haven't been out for months.

10:37.672 --> 10:40.674
l understand. Just my luck.

10:40.843 --> 10:45.590
lf you change your mind, there'll
be a moonbeam with our name on it.

10:45.766 --> 10:49.351
Ernie wants to take me to dinner
at his favourite restaurant.

10:49.522 --> 10:53.604
You and l have had dinner together
every night this week.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.989
Very funny book.

10:58.869 --> 11:01.360
Don't wait up.

11:01.538 --> 11:05.123
Sam, this is OK with you, isn't it?

11:05.294 --> 11:08.379
- Sam? ls this OK with you?
- Oh, yeah.

11:09.257 --> 11:13.470
Good night. Don't worry.
l'll have her back by Thursday.

11:16.976 --> 11:21.890
You did say you and Mom
hadn't been out to dinner for months?

11:24.154 --> 11:28.069
Yes, l'm afraid l've been caught in a lie.

11:29.786 --> 11:33.121
You were lying to get out of dating me?

11:34.919 --> 11:38.668
l'm sorry. l was only
trying to let you down easy.

11:38.840 --> 11:41.628
You were trying to let me down easy?

11:41.803 --> 11:47.641
- Mr Malone, you're not my type.
- l'm not your type?

11:47.811 --> 11:53.519
- You're not adding a lot to this chat.
- l'm not adding a lot to this chat!

11:53.694 --> 11:59.569
Really, l'm sorry. What can l say?
The initial attraction just isn't there.

11:59.744 --> 12:02.783
Hey, no problem.
Are you kidding me?

12:02.958 --> 12:07.205
l was just helping out my pal.
You're not my type either.

12:07.380 --> 12:09.670
- No harm done.
- No, none.

12:09.842 --> 12:15.005
There's nothing going on. No magic,
no spark, no reason to continue.

12:15.183 --> 12:18.387
What are you doing tomorrow?

12:18.562 --> 12:23.107
l'm not doing anything tomorrow,
but what does it matter?

12:23.277 --> 12:27.406
- l'm not interested in you.
- Right. We established that.

12:27.574 --> 12:29.864
Thursday? Friday? Saturday?

12:30.036 --> 12:32.824
Hey! l don't want to go out with you!

12:42.596 --> 12:47.140
OK, Norm, so he blew one.
He's not a god.

12:51.358 --> 12:54.644
- He was to me.
- There, there.

12:58.993 --> 13:01.995
My world doesn't make sense any more.

13:02.164 --> 13:04.454
What went wrong?

13:04.626 --> 13:08.839
Boy, if you ask me,
that girl's got a big problem.

13:09.007 --> 13:12.294
You're right. lt's called good taste.

13:13.514 --> 13:16.800
- There you go.
- That explains it.

13:19.397 --> 13:24.773
lt's the bottom of the ninth with two outs.
The Sox need a miracle here tonight.

13:24.947 --> 13:30.820
- Carla, the Sox are rallying.
- l've sworn off those losers forever.

13:32.122 --> 13:34.745
l am not interested.

13:35.711 --> 13:38.286
l retract everything! Go Sox!

13:38.465 --> 13:40.504
Oh, God!

13:45.891 --> 13:49.428
You know, l don't
ask for much in this life.

13:50.649 --> 13:52.689
Fresh fish.

13:52.860 --> 13:55.648
Ten cents off on laundry detergent.

13:55.822 --> 13:59.952
Volcanic boils all over my ex-husband.

14:00.120 --> 14:03.989
And the Sox in the Series again
before l die.

14:04.167 --> 14:06.956
- You're a good woman.
- Shove it!

14:10.509 --> 14:13.132
Sam, did you remember my sweater?

14:13.305 --> 14:15.844
Your... l'm sorry, l forgot again.

14:16.017 --> 14:18.057
l promise l'll bring it in.

14:18.228 --> 14:20.602
Please. l remind you every night.

14:20.774 --> 14:24.689
Well, it gives me a chance
to throw it in the machine.

14:24.862 --> 14:27.864
Don't throw it in the washer.

14:28.033 --> 14:31.950
lt's hand spun lamb's wool.
lt'll shrink up to nothing.

14:32.832 --> 14:35.917
lt'll shrink.
l'm glad we had this talk.

14:36.086 --> 14:38.839
l didn't realise that.

14:49.480 --> 14:52.731
Since l have to
part with that sweater,

14:52.943 --> 14:56.693
could you tell me where
l might get one exactly like it?

14:56.865 --> 15:00.817
l bought it in lreland years ago.
lt's one of a kind.

15:02.498 --> 15:07.043
So if a guy spent the morning
visiting department stores,

15:07.213 --> 15:10.501
he'd be wasting his time?

15:11.761 --> 15:15.261
Oh, l'm sorry! l'm sorry.

15:15.432 --> 15:17.925
lt's clean.

15:20.857 --> 15:23.147
Sam, how could you?

15:23.319 --> 15:27.188
Come on now, Diane.
Don't be small about this.

15:28.284 --> 15:30.741
l hate you!

15:31.622 --> 15:35.918
- Don't you want this?
- What in the world is it good for?

15:36.087 --> 15:40.501
Did you see that movie
''The lncredible Shrinking Woman''?

15:40.676 --> 15:45.091
l pray to God it never happens to you,
but you never know.

15:55.906 --> 15:58.529
l think l know somebody who's in love.

15:58.702 --> 16:01.324
Good, buy them a beer, Cliff, so am l.

16:01.497 --> 16:03.954
- l meant you.
- l don't need a beer.

16:04.126 --> 16:06.368
l'm just too happy as it is.

16:06.546 --> 16:09.583
Sorry things with Sue didn't work out.

16:09.758 --> 16:14.256
Don't worry about it.
Who needs that walking Frigidaire?

16:21.525 --> 16:26.901
Just goes to show
love can strike anywhere, anytime.

16:28.200 --> 16:31.785
lt doesn't ask your name
or your age. lt asks...

16:31.956 --> 16:34.828
How big are your bazongas?

16:38.548 --> 16:41.467
The beauty of this
moment was lost on you.

16:41.636 --> 16:45.220
Haven't you realised there
is a difference between

16:45.392 --> 16:49.557
the Coach's <i>ffire de coeur</i>
and your animal cravings?

16:49.731 --> 16:52.649
Tap your cloven hoof twice for ''yes''.

16:55.405 --> 16:59.238
- Coach, isn't it your night off tonight?
- Yeah.

16:59.411 --> 17:02.164
l'm taking lrene to Melville's for dinner.

17:03.583 --> 17:05.992
lt's expensive up north there.

17:06.170 --> 17:10.002
l've been saving.
This is a very special evening.

17:10.175 --> 17:15.136
lt's wonderful you two found each other.
You radiate such bliss.

17:15.308 --> 17:19.142
You know why?
Because we've so much in common.

17:19.314 --> 17:22.269
We both love music and ltalian food.

17:22.443 --> 17:27.606
She's a widow, l'm a widower.
She's a hairdresser, l've got hair.

17:27.784 --> 17:31.652
And get this,
neither of us have ever been to Utah.

17:31.831 --> 17:34.583
Oh, scary!

17:34.751 --> 17:38.038
Norm, check what
the back of my neck looks like.

17:38.214 --> 17:42.926
Every hair at attention.
Except for that one. Snap to, Mr!

17:43.847 --> 17:48.475
l've only known her for three weeks,
but this is the night.

17:48.645 --> 17:51.434
l'm going to ask her to marry me.

17:51.608 --> 17:54.065
- You're kidding me!
- All right!

17:56.574 --> 17:59.611
You devil!
You've been single for a long time.

17:59.786 --> 18:02.623
- You're sure?
- l'm sure.

18:02.790 --> 18:06.742
You know something?
Even my Angela would have liked her.

18:06.921 --> 18:09.592
- Don't you think?
- l think she would.

18:09.759 --> 18:13.544
l figured, why put it off?
We're not kids any more.

18:13.722 --> 18:18.802
l don't quite know how to ask her,
but anybody have any suggestions?

18:18.980 --> 18:21.852
The only proposal l heard was Nick's.

18:22.026 --> 18:24.518
lt worked, honey. What did he say?

18:24.696 --> 18:29.692
''Carla, l knocked you up, you know
where l live, so l guess l have to.''

18:32.373 --> 18:34.413
Not bad.

18:35.294 --> 18:37.869
Moving on to the higher primates...

18:38.048 --> 18:41.714
Normie, how did
you propose to Vera?

18:41.886 --> 18:43.927
Well, l...

18:44.098 --> 18:47.017
You know something? l don't think l did.

18:47.186 --> 18:52.063
- Could there be a loophole?
- Not if you consummated it.

18:52.234 --> 18:56.364
Egad! Why couldn't we have
had this conversation yesterday?

18:58.952 --> 19:03.082
l've written down a few ideas
and they will have to do.

19:03.250 --> 19:06.418
But, Normie, should
l ask her before we order?

19:06.588 --> 19:12.379
l don't want to ask with something
in my teeth, especially if it's green.

19:12.554 --> 19:16.138
Play it safe.
Drape a napkin over your head.

19:17.227 --> 19:19.137
Not bad.

19:20.690 --> 19:22.102
Hi, Ernie.

19:22.277 --> 19:25.444
Are you ready
for the best dinner of your life?

19:25.614 --> 19:30.907
Ernie, every dinner l have with you
is better than the one before it.

19:34.835 --> 19:39.499
Every Wednesday up at Melville's
the vegetable is spinach.

19:39.675 --> 19:43.010
Spinach is green
and you know what that means.

19:43.181 --> 19:46.800
So please sit down.
l've got a couple of questions.

19:47.854 --> 19:51.224
What l want to say is,
oh, wait a minute...

19:51.400 --> 19:53.560
l got it.

19:54.904 --> 19:57.776
lrene...l'm not a rich man.

19:58.743 --> 20:02.280
l'm not a young man.
l'm not a handsome man.

20:02.457 --> 20:05.910
l'm not a tall man.
l'm not a strong man.

20:06.087 --> 20:09.672
l'm not a talented man.
l'm not a well-travelled man.

20:09.843 --> 20:14.470
l'm not a smart man.
l'm not a milkman.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.800
l'm not a gingerbread man. l'm...

20:16.977 --> 20:19.434
What are you trying to say?

20:19.606 --> 20:23.189
l don't need a piece of paper
to tell you my feelings.

20:23.360 --> 20:26.648
lrene... Well, maybe l do.

20:31.122 --> 20:33.994
l'm not a rich man.
l'm not a young...

20:34.168 --> 20:36.208
Coach!

20:40.092 --> 20:43.795
Look, lrene,
what l'm trying to say is,

20:43.974 --> 20:48.304
l love you and l want you to marry me,
but l can't find the words.

20:48.479 --> 20:51.397
Ernie, you've said all you need to.

20:51.566 --> 20:55.317
- l'd love to be your wife.
- She said yes!

21:01.831 --> 21:05.665
lt's time for the bartender
to pour some champagne.

21:05.838 --> 21:08.874
- l'm sorry, Sam.
- No, no, Coach.

21:10.593 --> 21:12.219
l got it.

21:12.388 --> 21:17.728
There have been many
celebrations in this bar,

21:17.895 --> 21:23.318
but none as joyous and as inspiring
as what we are experiencing here.

21:23.486 --> 21:25.979
Wasn't it Swinburne who said...

21:26.157 --> 21:27.984
l'll get it!

21:28.953 --> 21:32.369
Guys, l'm the bartender.

21:38.299 --> 21:42.049
Well, hello, Sue.
lrene, it's your daughter.

21:43.555 --> 21:46.095
Well, this is a surprise.

21:46.268 --> 21:49.934
l've been expecting
this call for a long time.

21:50.106 --> 21:52.563
OK, commence begging.

21:53.737 --> 21:56.229
Sam, Sam Malone.

21:57.784 --> 22:01.071
Yeah, she's here.
She wants to talk to you.

22:04.919 --> 22:09.083
Sam, you seem to be working hard
to get a date with a woman

22:09.257 --> 22:14.218
who obviously wouldn't
cross the street to spit in your hair.

22:14.390 --> 22:18.223
Don't worry, she will
when she gets to know me.

22:24.321 --> 22:27.358
- What's wrong, sweetheart?
- l just...

22:27.534 --> 22:32.197
l can't believe it.
Ernie, l won the lottery!

22:32.374 --> 22:35.579
Two million dollars!

22:35.754 --> 22:37.793
My God! Two million bucks!

22:37.966 --> 22:42.011
- l think l'm a little woozy.
- Sam, get some brandy.

22:42.179 --> 22:45.845
Yeah, make it the good stuff.
She can afford it.

22:46.017 --> 22:52.023
Look, lrene, don't tell me that
was the only ticket you ever bought.

22:52.193 --> 22:55.314
- lt's a deal.
- l knew it! Sam!

22:56.407 --> 22:58.899
l think we ought to have a drink.

22:59.077 --> 23:02.163
- l'm buying!
- l thought of that, too.

23:03.167 --> 23:06.501
l can't believe it. l'm stinking rich!

23:06.672 --> 23:10.338
l'd better tell Vic
we're going to be a little late.

23:10.510 --> 23:12.669
Oh, boy, what a night!

23:12.846 --> 23:15.682
My goodness! How about that, lrene?

23:15.850 --> 23:18.521
- What a night for you.
- Magic!

23:18.688 --> 23:21.559
Two such wonderful developments.

23:21.734 --> 23:24.736
Yes, l won the lottery!

23:24.904 --> 23:27.112
And...

23:27.283 --> 23:30.155
...what was the other thing?

23:31.305 --> 23:37.260
