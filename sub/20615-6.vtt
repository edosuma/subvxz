Though this crazy
ol' war has kept up apart,

20:38.620 --> 20:42.760
I know in my heart that when
it's over, we'll be together.

20:42.790 --> 20:44.690
Once again.
- Again?

20:44.730 --> 20:46.660
You were never together
in the first place.

20:46.700 --> 20:48.630
- That is a technicality!

20:48.660 --> 20:50.830
- Admiral Ackbar sir,
we've obtained the last critical

20:50.870 --> 20:52.700
part for the Arrowhead.

20:52.740 --> 20:55.770
- That is good news, Freemakers.
Very good news.

20:55.800 --> 20:56.840
- Now we just need to find
a Kyber crystal

20:56.870 --> 20:58.710
to power the shields.

20:58.740 --> 21:00.940
- Hopefully Darth Vader
doesn't get to it first.

21:00.980 --> 21:02.680
[chuckles] What?

21:02.710 --> 21:04.580
- Um, how's that?

21:04.610 --> 21:06.610
- Yeah, we had a little run
in with the Dark Lord.

21:06.650 --> 21:08.520
- For some reason, he's
searching the galaxy

21:08.550 --> 21:09.680
for Kyber crystals.

21:09.720 --> 21:10.920
What's that about?

21:10.950 --> 21:13.790
- Hmm...
Maybe nothing, Freemakers.

21:13.820 --> 21:17.520
See you back on Home One.

21:17.560 --> 21:18.860
- Do you get the feeling
our very good news

21:18.890 --> 21:20.730
just became very bad news?

21:23.870 --> 21:25.630
- Summon the Bothans.

21:25.670 --> 21:28.700
We need to know if
the Empire is building

21:28.740 --> 21:30.840
another Death Star.
