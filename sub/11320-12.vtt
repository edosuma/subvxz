00:44.127 --> 00:45.879
Have you lost your mind?

00:46.629 --> 00:49.132
You could've gotten hurt.
Do you want to die?

01:02.896 --> 01:03.938
Wait.

01:04.731 --> 01:05.899
I need to talk to you.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.661
I'm sorry.

01:24.167 --> 01:27.712
I'm sorry about everything.

01:30.131 --> 01:31.966
You've done nothing wrong.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.767
I'm sorry that
I don't know anything about you!

01:46.731 --> 01:48.233
I had no clue

01:49.275 --> 01:51.027
why I was being like this.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.489
But when I thought about it,

01:57.575 --> 01:59.661
I realized that
I don't know anything about you.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.331
I memorized all the facts about you,

02:05.416 --> 02:06.584
yet I don't know you at all.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.423
Shouldn't you teach me?

02:19.013 --> 02:20.723
I don't know if you have debts,

02:20.807 --> 02:22.308
or if you have a man,

02:22.392 --> 02:23.977
or even if you're a murderer.

02:28.022 --> 02:31.276
I don't know a single thing,

02:39.284 --> 02:40.660
but it doesn't matter.

02:44.914 --> 02:46.082
I just want...

02:49.752 --> 02:51.921
I just want you by my side.

02:59.262 --> 03:00.430
I'll divorce you.

03:03.349 --> 03:04.893
If you want it that badly, I'll do it.

03:06.352 --> 03:07.520
But please...

03:11.149 --> 03:12.817
Can't you just stay by my side?

03:22.994 --> 03:25.246
I can't give you up.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.125
I'm sorry about everything.

03:31.252 --> 03:32.629
About everything.

03:37.550 --> 03:38.885
Please forgive me, just this once.

03:42.972 --> 03:44.974
Please forgive me just this once, Hye-su.

04:02.825 --> 04:04.619
You did nothing wrong.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.580
I'm sorry,

04:09.999 --> 04:12.669
but you're making me very uncomfortable.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.506
Goodbye.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.024
Are you awake?

05:23.156 --> 05:24.324
Gap-sun.

05:25.366 --> 05:26.659
Listen to me carefully.

05:30.913 --> 05:31.998
I decided

05:34.125 --> 05:35.918
to get you the surgery.

05:38.671 --> 05:40.465
I'm going to save you,

05:41.549 --> 05:43.885
so you'd better live long
and repay me for the rest of your days.

05:44.510 --> 05:45.803
Got it?

05:46.846 --> 05:49.140
There's no point in refusing.

05:49.390 --> 05:51.225
I don't care what you want.

05:51.768 --> 05:55.063
I'll strap you down if I must
to make you get the surgery.

05:56.856 --> 06:00.026
Your life is put up as collateral now.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.866
Live long to make up

06:07.325 --> 06:09.911
for the early deaths of our parents
and my wife.

06:11.746 --> 06:15.291
Do many good deeds
to help them rest in peace.

06:17.001 --> 06:18.503
You brat.

06:18.711 --> 06:19.879
If you want to be

06:19.962 --> 06:23.216
a little less sorry when you meet them
in the afterlife,

06:23.674 --> 06:25.927
you will have to do a lot of good deeds.

06:26.761 --> 06:27.804
Got it?

06:31.641 --> 06:32.934
Keep that in mind.

06:35.728 --> 06:39.565
Just do what I say from now on,

06:41.317 --> 06:42.401
okay?

06:53.704 --> 06:55.289
Go home now.

06:55.665 --> 06:57.583
Are you going to spend the night here?

07:00.002 --> 07:02.255
I'll stay. You should get some rest.

07:02.630 --> 07:05.758
Don't come here anymore.

07:07.135 --> 07:10.179
It's annoying to have your dad worry
about things here,

07:10.680 --> 07:13.599
and it's annoying to see
your mom struggling when she sees you.

07:14.058 --> 07:17.353
It's all messy and annoying.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.231
Go home.

07:20.857 --> 07:21.941
I'm sorry.

07:22.024 --> 07:23.067
It's fine.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.862
Let's get this over with quickly.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.450
Gosh, your mom

07:31.451 --> 07:33.828
has spent her whole life being a pain.

08:53.491 --> 08:54.825
I'm sorry, Na-yoon.

08:57.119 --> 08:59.789
Let's push back the meeting
between our families.

09:00.331 --> 09:04.126
Ji-hun will process his divorce
within the week,

09:05.044 --> 09:07.838
so we should wait until it's finalized.

09:08.130 --> 09:09.840
It'll look better that way.

09:11.342 --> 09:12.802
That's fine.

09:13.761 --> 09:15.972
I know Ji-hun is refusing
to have the meeting

09:16.597 --> 09:17.974
between our families.

09:19.642 --> 09:22.019
It's not like that.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.563
Don't push him too hard.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.732
It'll take some time for him.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.694
Thanks for understanding.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.282
Did you meet with Dad?

09:34.865 --> 09:36.701
You must be feeling pretty upset
these days.

09:39.370 --> 09:40.788
I know enough of what's going on.

09:42.039 --> 09:43.207
What did I tell you?

09:44.000 --> 09:46.002
I told you my brother is a troublemaker.

09:47.044 --> 09:50.339
When will you learn your lesson?

10:00.641 --> 10:02.184
Why did you want to see Na-yoon?

10:03.436 --> 10:05.730
Rumors are rampant in the company already

10:06.355 --> 10:08.107
that Ji-hun was scammed by that girl.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.234
I heard you paid her too.

10:12.236 --> 10:13.613
Where did you hear that?

10:14.280 --> 10:16.157
I heard the rumors started
at the restaurant.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.492
I guess they already knew about it there.

10:19.702 --> 10:22.663
Why did they register
their marriage though?

10:23.122 --> 10:24.957
Did he get scammed by that gold digger

10:25.207 --> 10:27.460
and foolishly register
their marriage for her?

10:32.256 --> 10:33.799
I told you to stay quiet.

10:34.342 --> 10:36.469
I told you not to mention it ever again.

10:36.552 --> 10:37.637
Dad!

10:37.720 --> 10:39.180
What did I tell you last time?

10:39.263 --> 10:41.015
I said if you ever bring up
his marriage again,

10:41.098 --> 10:42.892
you are no longer my son.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.894
Dad, you're being too harsh.

10:46.354 --> 10:47.647
Is he your only son?

10:48.105 --> 10:49.315
What am I?

10:49.607 --> 10:51.776
I have feelings too.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.944
Why are you always on Ji-hun's side?

10:54.028 --> 10:56.989
He's always getting into trouble!
So why is it always him?

10:57.448 --> 10:59.158
You think I don't have my reasons?

10:59.408 --> 11:01.035
Be half the man he is.

11:02.870 --> 11:03.913
Get out.

11:04.288 --> 11:05.539
I want to be alone.

11:05.956 --> 11:07.041
Dad,

11:07.750 --> 11:09.418
don't look down on me.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.047
-What?
-You'll regret it.

11:13.798 --> 11:16.008
Ever since your stroke last time,

11:16.175 --> 11:18.636
you seem to have lost
your sense of judgment.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.554
I'm warning you!

11:20.763 --> 11:22.264
If you look down on me,

11:23.265 --> 11:25.810
you will regret it very soon.

11:37.905 --> 11:40.449
HANNAM FOOD

11:41.534 --> 11:42.576
-Look at this.
-What?

11:45.371 --> 11:46.205
Oh, my.

11:46.330 --> 11:47.498
PROMOTIONS

11:47.623 --> 11:50.042
It looks like the Chairman's
leaning towards the second son.

11:50.126 --> 11:53.045
Yes. He has a bad reputation,
but he's apparently good at his job.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.922
They say he's much better
than his older brother.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.133
At this pace,

11:57.341 --> 11:59.385
he'll be a senior managing director
by the end of the year.

11:59.844 --> 12:02.304
He might even become vice-chairman
by the end of next year.

12:03.514 --> 12:05.182
No way. Gosh.

12:07.059 --> 12:08.644
-Hello.
-Congratulations on your promotion.

12:08.769 --> 12:09.645
-Hello.
-Hello.

12:21.991 --> 12:24.535
Ms. Oh's surgery has been scheduled.

12:26.203 --> 12:27.913
I'm not interested in that,

12:28.205 --> 12:29.832
so don't give me any more updates.

12:30.666 --> 12:31.709
Yes, sir.

12:32.585 --> 12:33.919
Find out

12:34.503 --> 12:37.840
what Jeong-hun has been up to.

12:39.383 --> 12:40.593
I have a feeling

12:41.677 --> 12:43.471
he'll cause problems.

12:47.224 --> 12:48.767
Oh my. Seung-ju.

12:48.851 --> 12:52.104
-You came in the nick of time.
-Are you moving out?

12:52.354 --> 12:53.397
Yes.

12:54.356 --> 12:55.774
When did you find a place?

12:57.818 --> 12:59.320
I'm moving into Ju-yeon's place for now.

12:59.945 --> 13:01.238
Why so suddenly?

13:01.947 --> 13:03.699
Is it because of the rumors
with that jerk?

13:03.991 --> 13:05.159
What rumors?

13:07.369 --> 13:08.954
Get over here.

13:09.955 --> 13:11.707
-What is it?
-Help me move the boxes.

13:13.792 --> 13:15.211
Eun-seong, aren't you hungry?

13:17.046 --> 13:19.298
Do we really have to move?

13:19.673 --> 13:20.549
Yes.

13:20.758 --> 13:21.967
What about Mister?

13:22.092 --> 13:24.094
Can he come with us?

13:24.261 --> 13:25.721
I told you already

13:25.930 --> 13:27.139
that he can't come with us.

13:30.559 --> 13:31.602
Wait.

13:31.936 --> 13:33.062
Hye-su,

13:33.145 --> 13:35.272
you didn't say you were moving out.

13:35.356 --> 13:36.982
We were going to leave anyway.

13:37.566 --> 13:39.610
Thank you for everything.

13:39.818 --> 13:41.403
But still,

13:41.529 --> 13:44.114
you should tell the manager.
What do you take me...

13:45.199 --> 13:46.617
My goodness!

13:47.243 --> 13:48.285
Oh my.

13:48.869 --> 13:51.163
-Hello.
-Hello.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.666
Give that to me.

13:53.832 --> 13:54.959
It's okay.

13:55.042 --> 13:57.711
No. Give it to me.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.922
It's okay. This is really heavy.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.049
You don't look very strong anyway.

14:02.132 --> 14:03.050
Come on, Seung-ju.

14:03.133 --> 14:05.344
-Wait. What?
-Oh my gosh.

14:05.427 --> 14:07.680
What do you mean,
I don't look very strong?

14:10.516 --> 14:12.351
My goodness.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.189
You'll hurt your back!

14:17.606 --> 14:19.400
This is a piece of cake.

14:19.483 --> 14:22.152
I can move a truckload of these.

14:24.029 --> 14:27.533
Oh, my. You're pretty useful, mister.

14:29.618 --> 14:30.494
Oh, my.

14:30.786 --> 14:33.205
Use me. Use me all you want.

14:33.289 --> 14:35.416
Gosh, this is so light.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.473
Gather round, everyone.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.517
Gather round.

14:54.685 --> 14:56.854
Kitchen staff and servers,
hurry up and gather.

14:58.188 --> 15:01.609
Stop pretending to work,
and get over here now!

15:05.112 --> 15:07.239
Tell me where you heard it.

15:07.489 --> 15:09.074
Well...

15:09.158 --> 15:10.409
Why can't you answer me?

15:10.659 --> 15:12.244
Everyone said they heard it from you.

15:12.661 --> 15:14.955
Did you see it yourself? Did you?

15:15.372 --> 15:17.791
Did you see Hye-su hit on Mr. Han?

15:18.334 --> 15:19.501
I did.

15:20.377 --> 15:22.630
I can't say it all,

15:22.796 --> 15:25.299
but she planned everything
before she even came here.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.092
What?

15:29.970 --> 15:31.096
Hello.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.389
Is Hye-su here?

15:33.265 --> 15:34.558
She's off today.

15:36.852 --> 15:38.520
That lady is so scary.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.690
I wanted to play around with her
but got burned instead.

15:42.149 --> 15:43.817
I was almost sued for sexual harassment.

15:46.153 --> 15:48.322
Please tell her not to sue me.

15:48.405 --> 15:49.949
I really didn't do anything.

15:50.074 --> 15:51.241
Tell her to let it go.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.952
I'll compensate you generously.

15:53.202 --> 15:54.244
Help me out.

15:57.623 --> 15:58.791
Where's Mr. Park?

16:00.376 --> 16:01.543
He's outside.

16:01.710 --> 16:02.878
Outside?

16:07.716 --> 16:09.468
Why are you standing around?
Get back to work.

16:09.551 --> 16:10.594
Move it.

16:19.728 --> 16:22.856
Mr. Han, when did you come?

16:23.607 --> 16:25.609
Hye-su, I'll be right back
after I drop off the things.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.778
I'll see you later, Eun-seong.

16:35.619 --> 16:36.787
What are you doing?

16:36.996 --> 16:38.163
As you can see,

16:38.414 --> 16:39.581
we're moving out.

16:40.207 --> 16:41.709
Thank you for everything.

16:42.334 --> 16:43.836
Who said you could move out?

16:44.211 --> 16:45.587
I can't move out as I please?

16:46.296 --> 16:48.549
I don't think you have any right
to say that anymore.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.552
Thanks to you,
we had a very comfortable stay here.

16:51.885 --> 16:53.512
The room was chilly,

16:54.013 --> 16:55.472
but it was nice.

16:56.390 --> 16:57.433
Hye-su.

16:57.766 --> 16:59.059
Let's go, Eun-seong.

17:01.770 --> 17:02.688
Eun-seong.

17:04.523 --> 17:05.524
Let's talk.

17:05.607 --> 17:06.650
Don't do this.

17:07.151 --> 17:08.777
I told you you're making me uncomfortable.

17:10.362 --> 17:11.530
Eun-seong.

17:12.740 --> 17:13.782
Eun-seong.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.576
Where are you?

17:16.577 --> 17:17.745
Eun-seong.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.040
Eun-seong.

17:22.374 --> 17:23.542
Eun-seong.

17:24.084 --> 17:25.127
Eun-seong.

17:31.341 --> 17:32.384
Eun-seong.

17:32.801 --> 17:33.844
Eun-seong.

17:34.136 --> 17:36.221
What are you doing there? Let's go.

17:37.222 --> 17:38.057
Get up.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.895
No. I won't go.

17:43.312 --> 17:44.354
Eun-seong.

17:45.564 --> 17:46.940
You go by yourself.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.692
I want to live here.

17:50.235 --> 17:52.446
I'll find a nice house for us soon.

17:52.529 --> 17:53.739
Just wait a little bit.

17:54.406 --> 17:55.574
No.

17:56.408 --> 17:57.576
Cha Eun-seong.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.370
I hate you.

18:01.622 --> 18:03.332
I hate Mister,

18:03.499 --> 18:04.792
and I hate you too.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.378
You're both liars.

18:14.134 --> 18:15.844
Will you live here by yourself, then?

18:17.221 --> 18:19.389
Yes, I'll live here by myself.

18:21.266 --> 18:22.601
I don't need you.

18:23.519 --> 18:24.853
I want you to disappear.

18:31.401 --> 18:32.444
Fine.

18:34.613 --> 18:35.823
Then live here by yourself.

18:37.741 --> 18:38.909
I'm leaving.

18:47.459 --> 18:48.502
Mom.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.509
I'm really leaving.

19:13.402 --> 19:14.695
Mom.

19:16.780 --> 19:17.990
Mom.

20:02.951 --> 20:04.912
Goodbye, Mister.

20:05.370 --> 20:06.997
We are moving out.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.875
Please take good care of the kittens.

20:10.125 --> 20:11.335
Sincerely, Eun-seong.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.815
My goodness.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.776
Go and sit down.

20:35.859 --> 20:37.945
Rest. Please.

20:38.153 --> 20:39.321
I'm fine.

20:39.780 --> 20:42.241
I feel bad enough already.
Don't make me feel worse.

20:42.866 --> 20:44.743
My goodness.

20:44.826 --> 20:47.579
Who can stop you?

20:50.123 --> 20:52.167
Where's the box with
Eun-seong's clothes again?

20:52.876 --> 20:54.336
-Eun-seong's clothes?
-Where did it go?

20:57.339 --> 20:58.382
Isn't this it?

21:03.220 --> 21:06.515
My goodness. You just unpacked it here.

21:10.310 --> 21:11.645
Silly you.

21:14.439 --> 21:16.108
Did I?

21:16.191 --> 21:17.359
You did.

21:18.193 --> 21:20.320
I've been so out of it lately.

21:37.754 --> 21:39.965
I LOVE YOU

21:40.048 --> 21:43.844
Eun-seong, do you want to get ice cream?

21:47.139 --> 21:48.181
Ice cream.

22:00.777 --> 22:01.820
Eun-seong.

22:02.529 --> 22:03.739
I'm sorry, Mom.

22:05.741 --> 22:06.908
For what?

22:07.993 --> 22:10.162
For telling you to disappear.

22:11.079 --> 22:12.581
I was just angry.

22:18.420 --> 22:19.588
I know.

22:20.922 --> 22:22.257
Of course, I know.

22:24.426 --> 22:27.179
Whatever you say,
I understand what you mean.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.182
You can say you hate me

22:31.099 --> 22:32.601
and tell me to disappear.

22:34.644 --> 22:35.854
I know

22:36.396 --> 22:37.939
it all means

22:39.066 --> 22:40.525
that you love me.

22:41.610 --> 22:42.861
So it's okay.

22:48.492 --> 22:49.868
Don't you ever

22:51.953 --> 22:53.580
regret it later on, okay?

22:56.374 --> 22:59.419
I understood what you really meant.

23:00.796 --> 23:02.297
You must remember that.

23:03.965 --> 23:05.008
Okay?

23:17.437 --> 23:18.980
I'm sorry for breaking up

23:21.316 --> 23:22.484
with Mr. Han.

23:27.697 --> 23:28.865
I'm sorry.

23:31.118 --> 23:32.327
I'm sorry.

23:46.883 --> 23:48.093
Thank you.

23:48.802 --> 23:49.970
For what?

23:54.766 --> 23:56.768
Thank you so much

23:57.894 --> 23:59.187
for being my daughter.

24:02.440 --> 24:03.859
I'll be good.

24:05.652 --> 24:07.112
I'll stay strong.

26:13.947 --> 26:15.115
What was that?

26:15.699 --> 26:17.200
Let me go and check.

26:19.911 --> 26:22.080
Gosh, who is it at this hour?

26:31.423 --> 26:32.757
What are you doing here at this hour?

26:34.259 --> 26:35.719
What are you doing?

26:36.052 --> 26:37.345
I want to see Eun-seong.

26:37.470 --> 26:38.638
-What--
-Please?

26:39.139 --> 26:40.181
Get out.

26:40.849 --> 26:42.517
-Let go.
-What are you doing?

26:46.771 --> 26:48.732
I came to see Eun-seong.

26:49.607 --> 26:51.526
-What are you doing?
-Gosh, let go.

26:52.902 --> 26:54.112
Please leave.

26:55.655 --> 26:56.698
Hey.

27:01.453 --> 27:02.662
Come here.

27:08.543 --> 27:09.878
I need to say something.

27:10.962 --> 27:12.005
Okay?

27:18.053 --> 27:19.346
I take it all back.

27:21.556 --> 27:22.766
I came to ask you...

27:26.019 --> 27:27.479
to forget

27:29.689 --> 27:30.857
everything I said.

27:37.697 --> 27:38.865
As you said,

27:39.908 --> 27:41.743
I must have been mistaken.

27:43.411 --> 27:44.829
I don't know what I expected

27:46.414 --> 27:48.708
from someone like you
when I said those things.

27:50.710 --> 27:51.878
I regret it now.

28:01.596 --> 28:02.764
Come to think of it,

28:04.641 --> 28:06.309
my feelings for you
weren't even that serious.

28:09.979 --> 28:11.189
I must have lost my mind.

28:12.440 --> 28:13.775
If I made you uncomfortable,

28:15.902 --> 28:17.153
I apologize.

28:20.031 --> 28:21.199
It's okay.

28:22.158 --> 28:23.368
There's no need.

28:25.245 --> 28:26.454
Are you done?

28:27.372 --> 28:28.540
I'll get going now.

28:29.707 --> 28:30.750
Hey.

28:37.715 --> 28:39.551
Don't live your life that way.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.471
Don't live that way!

28:43.847 --> 28:44.889
Okay.

28:46.433 --> 28:47.600
You're quite drunk.

28:48.852 --> 28:50.019
Please leave.

28:51.062 --> 28:52.439
Gosh.

28:57.235 --> 28:58.278
Hey.

28:59.404 --> 29:00.447
Ju-yeon.

29:01.781 --> 29:03.992
Well, hello.

29:04.075 --> 29:06.327
Mr. Han, it looks like you've had
a lot to drink.

29:06.411 --> 29:08.079
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

29:08.163 --> 29:10.248
No, you aren't.
You don't look fine at all.

29:10.331 --> 29:12.667
Hang on a minute.
Let me take care of this.

29:12.751 --> 29:13.918
-Ju-yeon.
-Hey.

29:14.002 --> 29:15.712
What a psycho.

29:15.795 --> 29:18.089
He's a lunatic.

29:18.548 --> 29:20.133
-Isn't he?
-Gosh.

29:42.155 --> 29:44.365
What's his problem?

29:44.657 --> 29:46.993
-Are you really okay?
-I'm fine.

29:47.076 --> 29:48.828
What a psycho.

29:49.913 --> 29:52.332
Why is he acting like that
when he has a girlfriend?

29:52.415 --> 29:54.125
Why is he here bothering you at this hour?

29:54.209 --> 29:56.544
You did the right thing by moving out.

29:57.253 --> 29:59.297
That punk woke me right up.

30:20.151 --> 30:21.319
Where's Jeong-hun?

30:23.822 --> 30:25.532
You don't even treat him like a son.

30:25.740 --> 30:27.242
Why do you care?

30:30.995 --> 30:32.163
I heard

30:33.373 --> 30:35.333
you promoted Ji-hun to executive director.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.585
The board decided it.

30:39.295 --> 30:41.005
You mean you decided it.

30:41.506 --> 30:43.508
What do you like so much about him?

30:43.716 --> 30:45.051
I want to know.

30:45.802 --> 30:46.970
It can't be

30:47.554 --> 30:49.764
because he's Mi-ran's son.

30:50.056 --> 30:51.349
It's not because I like him.

30:52.183 --> 30:54.602
How many times must I tell you
that it's important

30:54.936 --> 30:56.521
to marry him into Chairman Seo's family?

30:59.190 --> 31:00.233
So?

31:01.025 --> 31:02.902
Did Na-yoon agree to this marriage?

31:02.986 --> 31:04.571
Has she no pride?

31:05.572 --> 31:08.366
He even registered his marriage
with another woman he likes.

31:08.449 --> 31:10.577
You don't know anything,
so keep your mouth shut.

31:11.411 --> 31:14.497
I told you never to mention
the marriage registration again.

31:15.123 --> 31:16.416
If Jeong-hun had done such a thing,

31:17.375 --> 31:19.294
would you still have covered for him?

31:19.377 --> 31:20.420
What?

31:20.503 --> 31:22.922
Why do you hate your eldest son so much?

31:23.131 --> 31:24.173
Why?

31:26.092 --> 31:28.219
You act like he isn't your real son.

31:28.595 --> 31:30.346
You're right.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.473
He doesn't take after me at all.

31:32.932 --> 31:35.393
I don't know who he takes after
or why he's like that.

31:35.643 --> 31:37.270
It drives me crazy.

31:37.812 --> 31:38.897
What?

31:38.980 --> 31:42.567
Do you know how little respect he gets
at the company?

31:43.318 --> 31:45.570
He causes so much trouble

31:45.653 --> 31:47.363
and is abusive to his subordinates.

31:47.739 --> 31:50.992
He changed his secretary five times
this year alone.

31:51.409 --> 31:53.578
Must I still favor him

31:54.120 --> 31:55.580
just because he's my eldest son?

31:55.788 --> 31:56.956
So what now?

31:58.416 --> 32:00.835
Do you plan to kick him out?

32:01.002 --> 32:03.338
I'll decide based on how he does.

32:03.922 --> 32:06.883
If you keep this up,

32:08.051 --> 32:09.552
I won't take it any longer.

32:10.303 --> 32:12.263
I'll protect my son myself.

32:30.531 --> 32:32.450
I should've met with you sooner,

32:33.451 --> 32:35.370
but I thought it'd be uncomfortable
for the both of us,

32:35.578 --> 32:37.455
so I couldn't ask you to come.

32:38.539 --> 32:39.749
I'm sorry.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.335
I'm glad you know you should be.

32:44.337 --> 32:45.755
I'll cut to the chase.

32:46.255 --> 32:47.298
Listen.

32:48.841 --> 32:50.343
You can't marry Ji-hun.

32:50.885 --> 32:52.345
You know he has someone, right?

32:53.054 --> 32:54.472
They've even registered their marriage.

32:56.140 --> 32:57.183
Give up.

32:58.351 --> 33:01.312
I'll talk to your parents.

33:01.437 --> 33:03.731
-Mother.
-Don't call me that.

33:06.109 --> 33:07.276
To be honest,

33:08.111 --> 33:09.654
I can't understand you.

33:10.113 --> 33:13.032
Why are you still hung up
on someone like that?

33:13.282 --> 33:15.326
I'm sorry to you and Jeong-hun,

33:16.911 --> 33:19.163
but I love Ji-hun. I can't give him up.

33:19.247 --> 33:21.457
Plus, he married her to save his mom.

33:22.291 --> 33:23.418
His mom?

33:24.335 --> 33:25.545
What mom?

33:26.713 --> 33:27.880
Didn't you know?

33:28.089 --> 33:29.340
Do you mean Oh Mi-ran?

33:31.467 --> 33:32.635
Tell me the truth.

33:34.053 --> 33:35.596
What are you talking about?

33:42.186 --> 33:44.188
I can't face you.

33:45.565 --> 33:46.607
Leave me.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.572
There's no reason to.

33:53.114 --> 33:54.407
You made the right decision.

33:56.909 --> 33:58.578
Thank you for understanding.

33:59.662 --> 34:01.581
Thank Uncle, not me.

34:02.790 --> 34:05.501
What happened with that girl?

34:06.586 --> 34:07.962
Did you settle everything well?

34:14.135 --> 34:17.138
Something is suspicious about you.

34:18.514 --> 34:19.849
What do you mean?

34:22.226 --> 34:23.269
I'm right, aren't I?

34:28.441 --> 34:29.484
Mom.

34:35.448 --> 34:36.491
Never mind.

34:37.075 --> 34:38.701
It's nothing.
Prepare well the for surgery.

34:38.993 --> 34:40.036
I'll get going now.

34:50.254 --> 34:51.339
Hye-su!

34:51.547 --> 34:53.174
-Yes?
-Come here.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.138
What is this?

34:59.764 --> 35:00.973
It is the sauce.

35:01.390 --> 35:02.558
What happened to it?

35:03.726 --> 35:04.769
It's frozen.

35:05.186 --> 35:07.230
It's frozen solid.

35:08.523 --> 35:10.566
Why was this in the freezer?

35:16.072 --> 35:17.865
I forgot and...

35:18.449 --> 35:19.617
What's wrong with you lately?

35:19.700 --> 35:21.786
Are you being careless
just because you're going to quit?

35:22.036 --> 35:23.579
You even burned the soup yesterday.

35:23.871 --> 35:25.623
Why is a young person like you
so forgetful?

35:26.999 --> 35:28.167
I'm sorry.

35:29.710 --> 35:30.878
Hello.

35:46.769 --> 35:49.438
The Chairman called.
Did you ignore his calls again?

35:50.398 --> 35:52.525
-Why did he call?
-He asked me to find out

35:52.608 --> 35:54.026
when you're going to court.

35:56.112 --> 35:57.280
You didn't file for divorce yet?

35:58.239 --> 35:59.407
Tell him I'm going tomorrow.

36:00.449 --> 36:01.701
With Hye-su?

36:02.368 --> 36:04.328
Don't mention her name ever again.

36:04.495 --> 36:05.538
It offends me.

36:08.875 --> 36:10.042
Are you going home already?

36:10.126 --> 36:11.002
Yes.

36:11.460 --> 36:13.004
Did you get another job?

36:13.588 --> 36:14.964
Where do you always rush off to?

36:15.381 --> 36:16.549
It's nothing.

36:17.091 --> 36:18.926
I'm just going to pick up Eun-seong.

36:19.427 --> 36:21.679
Wait. I want to ask you something.

36:22.221 --> 36:23.264
What is it?

36:24.307 --> 36:27.101
Did you really like him?

36:34.609 --> 36:35.651
I'll get going.

36:44.285 --> 36:47.205
HEART NAIL

36:47.330 --> 36:48.497
Ma'am.

36:49.123 --> 36:50.333
What brings you here?

36:51.626 --> 36:53.502
I heard Hye-su is staying here.

36:54.545 --> 36:56.464
Yes, she is.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.466
So you've heard.

36:58.549 --> 37:00.468
She hasn't come back

37:00.801 --> 37:02.845
from work yet though.

37:05.556 --> 37:07.141
Well... Ma'am,

37:07.850 --> 37:08.976
-have a seat.
-Okay.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.270
-Would you like some tea?
-No, I'm good.

37:11.354 --> 37:14.232
Give this to Eun-seong later.

37:14.315 --> 37:16.067
Okay. She'll be so happy.

37:18.653 --> 37:20.988
Something's going on with Hye-su, right?

37:22.782 --> 37:23.824
Pardon?

37:27.161 --> 37:29.580
No, there's nothing going on.

37:30.581 --> 37:33.376
Is she very upset

37:33.584 --> 37:35.378
over her breakup?

37:35.836 --> 37:37.797
Gosh, not at all.

37:38.130 --> 37:41.634
She's so relieved
that she broke up with him.

37:41.926 --> 37:45.388
You have no idea what a jerk he was.

37:45.596 --> 37:47.473
Thank goodness they broke up.

37:48.849 --> 37:49.850
Really?

37:51.477 --> 37:54.772
Then again,
he didn't look like a very nice guy.

37:55.022 --> 37:57.650
I've never met anyone with dimples

37:57.733 --> 37:59.610
who turned out to be a good person.

38:00.569 --> 38:01.612
Ma'am.

38:01.821 --> 38:03.030
That isn't right.

38:03.364 --> 38:04.865
I have dimples, too.

38:05.825 --> 38:07.743
You don't have dimples.

38:07.952 --> 38:09.870
-Those are wrinkles.
-Ma'am!

38:09.954 --> 38:12.373
I'm so hurt. They aren't wrinkles.

38:12.456 --> 38:13.958
This is a dimple.

38:14.041 --> 38:15.626
This one, too.

38:15.710 --> 38:16.752
See?

38:18.963 --> 38:21.215
Is she really okay?

38:21.465 --> 38:22.633
Gosh.

38:23.009 --> 38:24.927
Don't worry.

38:25.011 --> 38:27.555
Hye-su is really fine.

38:29.890 --> 38:32.893
But why is her face so thin and pale?

38:33.352 --> 38:35.313
She looks so sick.

38:35.563 --> 38:37.606
Why else would I have come here?

38:39.734 --> 38:42.820
Eun-seong will be so happy.
Thank you, ma'am.

38:42.903 --> 38:44.864
Don't change the subject.

38:45.614 --> 38:46.782
Is she sick?

38:51.704 --> 38:52.872
Ms. Kang Hye-su.

38:53.372 --> 38:54.540
That was tiring, wasn't it?

38:55.958 --> 38:57.168
A little.

38:57.251 --> 38:58.377
How are the side effects?

38:58.461 --> 39:00.046
Any dizziness or vomiting?

39:01.297 --> 39:02.715
It's bearable so far.

39:03.007 --> 39:04.175
I'm glad.

39:04.633 --> 39:06.761
Have you experienced
any memory loss or illusions?

39:08.929 --> 39:10.598
Not really.

39:10.681 --> 39:12.808
Eat well and rest well.

39:13.476 --> 39:14.769
I'll see you at your next treatment.

39:15.394 --> 39:16.937
You look exhausted.

39:42.546 --> 39:43.631
MR. HAN

39:44.590 --> 39:46.092
Let's meet at the courthouse tomorrow.

40:51.115 --> 40:52.158
Nine.

40:57.371 --> 40:59.248
KANG HYE-SU

40:59.331 --> 41:00.458
It's okay.

41:02.376 --> 41:03.544
More.

41:11.594 --> 41:12.887
-Give it to me.
-Okay.

41:17.808 --> 41:19.602
-Hello?
-Hello?

41:23.230 --> 41:24.607
Isn't this Kang Hye-su's phone?

41:24.690 --> 41:26.609
This is the hospital.

41:26.692 --> 41:29.487
I think the owner of the phone
left her bag here.

41:29.987 --> 41:32.114
You were the person she contacted
most recently.

41:32.490 --> 41:33.532
The hospital?

41:33.949 --> 41:35.159
DAON HOSPITAL

41:35.242 --> 41:37.745
I've arrived. Where are you?

41:37.828 --> 41:39.079
Over here, mister!

41:40.831 --> 41:41.874
Here.

41:42.458 --> 41:43.334
I see.

41:51.050 --> 41:52.218
It is you.

41:52.468 --> 41:53.511
Here.

41:58.599 --> 41:59.642
Thank you.

42:09.652 --> 42:11.654
PRESCRIPTION MEDICINE

42:24.959 --> 42:26.126
Neurosurgery?

42:28.045 --> 42:29.755
What is your relationship to the patient?

42:31.507 --> 42:32.591
I'm her husband.

42:32.675 --> 42:35.469
How could a husband do that?

42:35.970 --> 42:36.929
Pardon?

42:37.012 --> 42:40.182
How could you not come once with your wife
for all those difficult treatments?

42:40.891 --> 42:43.477
I actually believed her
when she said she didn't have a guardian.

42:43.852 --> 42:46.105
Difficult treatments?

42:46.981 --> 42:48.399
What do you mean?

42:48.899 --> 42:49.942
You don't know?

42:52.486 --> 42:53.654
What does she have?

42:54.196 --> 42:55.489
You really don't know?

42:56.782 --> 42:58.075
Are you sure you're her husband?

43:00.160 --> 43:01.328
Yes, I am.

43:02.288 --> 43:03.455
Please tell me.

43:03.706 --> 43:04.873
What does she have?

43:05.124 --> 43:06.792
Show me your family registry first.

43:06.875 --> 43:09.545
Why do you need that?
I said I'm her husband.

43:09.628 --> 43:13.007
Then how could you not know
that your wife is fighting for her life?

43:14.925 --> 43:16.093
What?

43:21.265 --> 43:23.142
Her likelihood of survival isn't high.

43:24.268 --> 43:25.894
She did begin her treatment,

43:26.729 --> 43:29.398
but we don't know
how many years it'll take.

43:46.248 --> 43:49.001
Excuse me. Did you not see a bag here?

43:49.084 --> 43:51.086
I think I left it here.

43:51.712 --> 43:52.755
This?

43:52.838 --> 43:54.006
Is this it?

43:54.340 --> 43:55.507
Yes.

43:55.674 --> 43:57.676
Someone dropped it off earlier.

43:57.760 --> 43:59.136
Thank you.

44:33.045 --> 44:34.213
Gosh.

44:35.005 --> 44:36.048
Thanks.

44:37.341 --> 44:39.677
You lost your phone last time,

44:40.803 --> 44:42.596
and today, you forgot your bag.

44:46.016 --> 44:47.184
What's wrong with you lately?

44:53.232 --> 44:54.400
Then again,

44:57.027 --> 44:58.821
how could you not be out of it?

45:00.447 --> 45:01.990
I don't blame you.

45:04.993 --> 45:06.203
Kang Hye-su,

45:08.038 --> 45:10.874
I know this doesn't help,

45:13.127 --> 45:14.586
but put your mind at peace,

45:15.045 --> 45:17.256
and think only positive thoughts.

45:27.057 --> 45:28.100
Ju-yeon.

45:28.809 --> 45:29.852
What?

45:30.436 --> 45:32.771
My condition may get worse.

45:34.189 --> 45:36.024
Not just memory loss.

45:37.067 --> 45:39.069
I may lose my sight,

45:41.822 --> 45:43.115
and I may not...

45:45.492 --> 45:48.662
recognize you or Eun-seong.

45:49.997 --> 45:51.832
Stop your nonsense.

45:53.208 --> 45:55.419
-Ju-yeon, if--
-If what?

45:57.171 --> 45:58.755
Just in case...

46:03.051 --> 46:04.595
If I die

46:05.220 --> 46:06.680
leaving Eun-seong behind,

46:17.733 --> 46:19.234
can you please

46:21.987 --> 46:23.655
bring her up?

46:31.371 --> 46:32.539
Are you crazy?

46:32.748 --> 46:34.291
Why would I raise your child?

46:34.374 --> 46:35.667
Her mom should raise her.

46:37.711 --> 46:40.464
If you're going to talk like that,
I want you to move out of my house!

46:48.388 --> 46:49.556
Never mind.

46:50.766 --> 46:52.309
I must have lost my mind.

46:53.560 --> 46:55.437
Why do I keep saying things like that?

46:56.563 --> 46:58.524
Stop it.

46:58.982 --> 47:00.192
I'm sorry.

47:02.945 --> 47:04.112
Don't cry.

47:26.426 --> 47:28.011
Sorry, Eun-seong.

47:53.161 --> 47:54.621
We should draw up the contract first.

47:55.289 --> 47:56.456
How much do you want?

47:56.623 --> 47:57.874
Give me a lot.

48:01.211 --> 48:04.214
Enough to use until my daughter grows up

48:06.633 --> 48:08.176
and can survive on her own.

48:10.345 --> 48:12.556
This isn't easy for me, either.

48:12.639 --> 48:13.807
I am

48:14.600 --> 48:16.393
putting my life on the line.

48:16.476 --> 48:18.145
Why are you acting so weak now?

48:19.396 --> 48:21.064
The surgery won't kill you.

50:11.967 --> 50:15.053
FAMILY ALBUM

50:18.473 --> 50:22.060
HELLO, JI-HUN!
HI, HYE-SU!

50:52.549 --> 50:54.092
Why are you drinking so much?

50:54.176 --> 50:55.594
Give it to me.

50:56.303 --> 50:58.972
How can I survive without alcohol?

50:59.556 --> 51:01.975
I'm too humiliated to go to work.

51:02.601 --> 51:04.144
Everyone calls me a saint

51:04.394 --> 51:07.939
for putting up with being pushed aside
by my worthless brother.

51:08.273 --> 51:10.859
Dad has lost his mind.

51:11.067 --> 51:13.987
He married that girl who conned him.

51:14.070 --> 51:16.156
How could Dad be so protective of him?

51:16.490 --> 51:18.992
Do you think I'll just stay silent
about this?

51:19.075 --> 51:20.827
I have a plan too.

51:20.911 --> 51:22.078
Just wait and see!

51:23.288 --> 51:24.331
Jeong-hun.

51:24.748 --> 51:25.916
What?

51:26.208 --> 51:28.001
Stop freaking out,

51:28.627 --> 51:30.504
and be reasonable.

51:30.629 --> 51:33.215
This is why your dad doesn't respect you.

51:33.298 --> 51:34.841
Mom!

51:35.801 --> 51:37.010
I don't expect you

51:37.427 --> 51:39.971
to sacrifice yourself as he did
for his mom.

51:40.430 --> 51:41.598
But still,

51:42.390 --> 51:45.018
can't you be a little bit reliable?

51:46.186 --> 51:48.438
Do you know how upset
and lonely I've been lately?

51:48.522 --> 51:50.524
Why? What is it?

51:50.607 --> 51:52.776
How can I know if you don't tell me?

51:52.859 --> 51:54.069
And what sacrifice?

51:54.152 --> 51:55.821
What is that about?

51:56.154 --> 51:57.030
What is it?

52:02.202 --> 52:04.287
-Honey.
-Hey.

52:04.371 --> 52:05.539
Hi there.

52:05.622 --> 52:06.790
Come here.

52:07.165 --> 52:09.876
I looked into what you asked for.
Here is your father's medical record.

52:11.086 --> 52:14.714
They said his thinking and judgment skills
can be affected by his stroke.

52:14.798 --> 52:17.592
It would be awesome if I could get

52:17.676 --> 52:18.969
a diagnosis of dementia.

52:19.636 --> 52:20.804
That would be

52:21.513 --> 52:22.597
hard to fake, right?

52:22.681 --> 52:24.057
-What is this?
-Yes.

52:24.599 --> 52:25.976
What is it? A diagnosis?

52:26.059 --> 52:28.270
You wouldn't know what this is.

52:28.353 --> 52:29.354
Of course, I would.

52:29.437 --> 52:32.524
Just pour me a drink and stay out of it!

52:32.607 --> 52:34.067
What's wrong with you?

52:35.694 --> 52:37.237
Who are you?

52:39.489 --> 52:41.616
I thought he'd be of help.

52:42.450 --> 52:45.245
He says he knows Kang Hye-su well.

52:47.330 --> 52:49.082
-Is that so?
-It's nice to meet you.

52:49.624 --> 52:50.792
I'm Oh Dae-hyeon.

52:55.839 --> 52:57.549
What time should we meet today?

53:14.274 --> 53:15.442
At noon.

55:12.475 --> 55:13.643
Oh my.

55:14.936 --> 55:16.104
Hye-su.

55:21.276 --> 55:22.777
What happened?

55:23.236 --> 55:24.529
When did you cut your hair?

55:25.238 --> 55:26.489
Does it look bad?

55:28.491 --> 55:29.909
You put on makeup too.

55:31.202 --> 55:32.620
Are you going somewhere?

55:33.079 --> 55:34.247
I'm going to get divorced.

55:35.290 --> 55:36.207
Divorced?

55:36.666 --> 55:37.834
I'm going to the courthouse.

55:39.502 --> 55:41.504
I want to look pretty,
since it'll be the last time.

55:49.012 --> 55:50.055
Okay.

55:54.059 --> 55:55.101
You...

56:01.483 --> 56:02.525
See you later.

56:07.697 --> 56:08.782
Honey.

56:08.865 --> 56:10.617
-I don't want to talk.
-Why do you want a divorce?

56:10.700 --> 56:12.327
Please calm down.

56:12.869 --> 56:14.537
My goodness.

56:21.669 --> 56:23.338
Did you wait long?

56:37.310 --> 56:38.394
I like your hair.

56:40.855 --> 56:42.023
It's spring, so...

56:44.400 --> 56:45.568
Should we go in?

56:47.904 --> 56:49.072
Have you had lunch?

56:54.327 --> 56:55.370
Not yet.

56:57.330 --> 56:59.874
It's lunchtime for the workers here.

57:01.376 --> 57:02.627
Let's go eat first.

57:17.559 --> 57:18.726
Why aren't you eating?

57:18.852 --> 57:19.894
I'm eating.

57:21.354 --> 57:22.522
This place is good.

57:23.440 --> 57:24.774
It's better than our restaurant.

57:26.109 --> 57:27.777
Then eat up.

57:33.366 --> 57:34.409
Thank you.

57:34.951 --> 57:35.994
For what?

57:36.411 --> 57:37.662
Regardless of what happened,

57:38.413 --> 57:40.290
I am grateful for all that you did.

57:43.376 --> 57:45.712
Thank you for being so kind

57:46.087 --> 57:47.255
to Eun-seong too.

57:47.464 --> 57:48.506
Forget it.

57:49.090 --> 57:50.884
I didn't do anything deserving of thanks.

57:51.176 --> 57:52.552
It sounds like sarcasm, so stop.

57:54.971 --> 57:56.473
I hope you meet someone nice.

57:57.891 --> 57:59.767
I hope you'll be happy.

58:08.359 --> 58:09.527
Whatever.

58:11.571 --> 58:13.323
Eat. It's getting cold.

58:24.709 --> 58:25.752
After lunch,

58:26.169 --> 58:27.545
let's watch a movie.

58:28.087 --> 58:29.130
What?

58:29.214 --> 58:30.882
You can do that much for me.

58:31.216 --> 58:33.301
Think of it as after-sales service.

58:37.013 --> 58:39.015
It's the last time anyway.
Think of it as a favor.

58:39.724 --> 58:41.184
Unless you can't stand being with me.

58:43.853 --> 58:45.146
Is there anything you want to watch?

58:47.232 --> 58:48.441
I'll choose, then.

58:52.070 --> 58:53.696
Here's your popcorn.

58:55.657 --> 58:56.866
Enjoy.

58:59.911 --> 59:01.079
Mr. Han.

59:01.371 --> 59:03.957
We'll go to the courthouse. Don't worry.

59:07.126 --> 59:09.170
Let's keep walking. It's nice out.

59:10.922 --> 59:12.382
Don't you have anything to tell me?

59:13.925 --> 59:15.093
No.

59:16.594 --> 59:18.096
Then walk until you do.

59:19.305 --> 59:20.473
Look.

59:21.766 --> 59:23.059
Did you think of something?

59:25.061 --> 59:26.271
The cherry blossoms are in bloom.

59:29.357 --> 59:30.567
They're pretty.

59:43.288 --> 59:45.623
Is that what you wanted to say?

59:46.124 --> 59:47.458
What else do I say?

59:47.667 --> 59:49.168
Say anything.

59:50.878 --> 59:52.046
Mr. Han.

59:53.256 --> 59:56.426
Can't you just call me "Ji-hun"
or something?

59:56.968 --> 59:58.386
I don't like being called "Mr. Han."

1:00:00.597 --> 1:00:02.015
I have no right to ask this,

1:00:02.390 --> 1:00:04.142
since we're going to be nothing
to each other now,

1:00:05.518 --> 1:00:06.853
but can you call me by name?

1:00:08.855 --> 1:00:10.231
Then I can speak casually too.

1:00:11.691 --> 1:00:13.109
Let's do that.

1:00:13.943 --> 1:00:15.111
Okay?

1:00:15.445 --> 1:00:17.155
We're breaking up anyway.

1:00:19.073 --> 1:00:20.116
Hey.

1:00:20.450 --> 1:00:21.451
Hye-su.

1:00:23.578 --> 1:00:25.330
Do you really not have anything
to say to me?

1:00:25.788 --> 1:00:26.831
No, I don't.

1:00:28.666 --> 1:00:29.709
Really?

1:00:30.627 --> 1:00:32.128
Then let's take a walk around Seoul.

1:00:32.587 --> 1:00:34.756
-Mr. Han.
-I said not to call me that.

1:00:35.923 --> 1:00:37.550
Is that all I was to you?

1:00:38.217 --> 1:00:39.969
You are always polite and distant.

1:00:40.470 --> 1:00:42.430
Did I make you feel that uncomfortable?

1:00:42.972 --> 1:00:44.182
Was I just...

1:00:53.149 --> 1:00:54.192
Fine.

1:00:55.193 --> 1:00:56.277
Let's go.

1:00:57.862 --> 1:00:59.197
Let's get divorced.

1:01:16.130 --> 1:01:19.884
PETITION FOR DIVORCE

1:01:20.426 --> 1:01:21.636
Let's go.

1:01:21.719 --> 1:01:23.012
What do you want to eat?

1:01:34.857 --> 1:01:36.025
What are you doing?

1:01:36.818 --> 1:01:37.819
Sue me.

1:01:38.027 --> 1:01:39.112
I can't divorce you.

1:01:39.529 --> 1:01:41.489
-What?
-Sue me.

1:01:42.198 --> 1:01:43.366
Have you gone crazy?

1:01:44.784 --> 1:01:46.744
Yes, I've gone crazy.

1:01:49.580 --> 1:01:50.623
Excuse me.

1:01:51.082 --> 1:01:52.166
Excuse me.

1:01:52.750 --> 1:01:54.127
What are you doing?

1:01:54.210 --> 1:01:55.169
COURTHOUSE

1:01:56.087 --> 1:01:57.296
Excuse me.

1:02:02.552 --> 1:02:03.970
What's wrong with you?

1:02:04.595 --> 1:02:05.763
What is it?

1:02:08.057 --> 1:02:09.100
I...

1:02:11.561 --> 1:02:12.770
I will save you.

1:02:24.115 --> 1:02:25.491
I'll save you.

1:02:28.244 --> 1:02:29.912
You saved my life,

1:02:32.081 --> 1:02:33.291
so I'll save yours.

1:02:38.588 --> 1:02:40.590
Stop being so pitiful
over some stupid illness,

1:02:40.923 --> 1:02:42.550
you frustrating woman!

1:03:14.999 --> 1:03:17.210
