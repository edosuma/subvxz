00:01.102 --> 00:03.237
You're facing your fears
with The Exorcist.

00:03.271 --> 00:05.906
-Unclean spirit!
-In the name of God!

Catch all-new episodes Fridays.

00:07.741 --> 00:09.210

our other Fox programs--

The Gifted, Lucifer, and Gotham.

00:11.912 --> 00:14.315
I can make a difference, Alfred.
I know I can.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.549
Only on Fox.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.320
-Previously on The Exorcist...
-You can't battle

00:19.353 --> 00:20.688
the demon inside.

00:20.721 --> 00:21.922
Once you let that thing
in your head,

00:21.955 --> 00:23.224
you're giving it access
to your hopes,

00:23.257 --> 00:25.193
your fears,
your darkest secrets.

00:25.226 --> 00:26.694
This could be the key
to saving her.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.262
If we find a way in,

00:28.296 --> 00:30.064
we find a way
to drive the demon out.

00:30.098 --> 00:31.499
Show yourself to me.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.134
Cindy?

00:34.935 --> 00:36.104
Where is she?

00:36.137 --> 00:37.205
Your wife's a very sick woman.

00:37.238 --> 00:38.206
She isn't sick.

00:38.239 --> 00:39.440
She lost a child.

00:39.473 --> 00:42.042
I got you.

00:42.076 --> 00:43.611
Okay, get out of my house.
Go to school.

00:43.644 --> 00:46.046
Oh, remember,
Rose is coming tonight at 6:00.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.448
-Good to see you.
-Good to...

00:47.481 --> 00:48.882
I'm sorry about Nicole.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.751
I'm just here to do
a formal assessment.

00:50.784 --> 00:53.354
I need to spend some time
with these kids.

00:53.387 --> 00:56.056
It's a test. And when you pass,
you're one of us.

00:56.090 --> 00:57.291
Count to ten.

00:57.325 --> 00:58.859
-One...
-SHELBY: Not cool.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.361
I wasn't gonna let him do it.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.262
ANDY:
Caleb?

01:02.263 --> 01:03.397
Stay right there, Caleb.

01:03.431 --> 01:05.299
-One...
-(creaking)

01:08.836 --> 01:11.472
The Morning Star sends
his greetings.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.307
And I send mine.

01:20.248 --> 01:22.583
*

01:37.198 --> 01:39.333
(pen scribbling)

01:46.207 --> 01:48.142
(footsteps approaching)

01:49.810 --> 01:51.412
MAN:
Bad news.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.981
What other kind is there?

01:54.014 --> 01:57.685
Word of your investigation
has reached the tribunal.

01:57.718 --> 02:00.188
(pen drops)

02:00.221 --> 02:03.023
They insist on hearing
your evidence presently.

02:03.056 --> 02:04.625
It's still being assembled.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.194
We're not ready.

02:06.227 --> 02:09.363
A paranoid man would say
that is precisely the point.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.504
BENNETT:
As I've already mentioned,

02:16.537 --> 02:19.707
the conspiracy is vast
and well-hidden.

02:19.740 --> 02:22.210
We all know the symptoms
of demonic possession.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.845
But many in the Church do not
recognize the second phase

02:24.878 --> 02:29.383
of possession, an irreversible
phase called integration,

02:29.417 --> 02:32.653
the permanent fusion of
the demon and the human soul.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.688
We know what integration is.

02:34.722 --> 02:36.690
Yes.

02:36.724 --> 02:39.059
But do you know
they walk among us,

02:39.092 --> 02:41.495
invisible?

02:41.529 --> 02:43.631
I have reason to believe
that the integrated

02:43.664 --> 02:46.967
have infiltrated
every level of the Church.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.136
Even here in Rome.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.805
Bring in the cardinal.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.507
(footsteps approaching)

03:08.922 --> 03:11.692
You look well, Father Bennett.

03:13.126 --> 03:15.596
Cardinal Guillot,

03:15.629 --> 03:17.998
you have been accused
of demonic possession.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.567
Not possession, integration.

03:19.600 --> 03:20.901
You've had your turn.

03:20.934 --> 03:23.070
I apologize for asking,

03:23.103 --> 03:26.940
but have you experienced
any such... symptoms?

03:26.974 --> 03:29.777
Do you count arthritis?

03:29.810 --> 03:31.379
(tribunal president chuckling)

03:31.412 --> 03:32.913
BENNETT:
I came to you

03:32.946 --> 03:35.349
with proof of a plot
against the Holy Father.

03:35.383 --> 03:37.084
And what did you do?

03:37.117 --> 03:38.852
Put a bag over my head.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.588
Slit my wrist.

03:40.621 --> 03:43.291
Left me to bleed out in a room
with a demon for company.

03:43.324 --> 03:47.528
Enough! Sir, slander like this
will not stand.

03:47.561 --> 03:53.033
Please, he has been subject
to great stress.

03:53.066 --> 03:57.971
He was responsible
for the Pope's security.

03:58.005 --> 04:00.140
A failure like that

04:00.173 --> 04:03.377
weighs heavily on a man.

04:03.411 --> 04:06.347
I know what you are.

04:11.184 --> 04:13.987
Must I prove myself to you?

04:36.977 --> 04:39.313
(spoon clinking)

04:49.823 --> 04:53.126
Unless you'd like
to bless it yourself?

04:53.160 --> 04:55.496
And that will not
be necessary, Cardinal.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.133
Please, continue.

05:05.072 --> 05:08.008
À votre santé.

05:20.754 --> 05:23.357
Was there anything else?

05:23.391 --> 05:26.560
We're very sorry
for having wasted your time.

05:26.594 --> 05:27.828
Va bene.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.430
Non ti preoccupare.

05:46.714 --> 05:49.016
TRIBUNAL PRESIDENT:
You are right about one thing--

05:49.049 --> 05:51.519
there is a conspiracy
against the Church.

05:51.552 --> 05:54.054
But it was perpetrated
by a single rogue priest.

05:54.087 --> 05:56.056
Dishonored. Excommunicated.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.826
A man who tried to assassinate
the Holy Father

05:58.859 --> 06:01.495
and killed one of our brothers.

06:01.529 --> 06:03.230
Tell me, Father Bennett,

06:03.263 --> 06:05.933
where is Marcus Keane?

06:12.072 --> 06:15.375
*

06:47.074 --> 06:49.176
(groans)

06:51.812 --> 06:53.113
(groans)

06:53.146 --> 06:55.583
(panting)

06:55.616 --> 06:58.118
(indistinct voices nearby)

07:05.459 --> 07:07.327
How long was I out?

07:07.360 --> 07:09.129
It's been a while.

07:09.162 --> 07:12.132
(groans, panting)

07:12.165 --> 07:14.067
Where is she?

07:14.101 --> 07:16.637
Well, rise and shine.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.806
Where did you take her?

07:18.839 --> 07:21.308
Hospital, of course.

07:21.341 --> 07:24.344
-What does that matter? -'Cause
unless you untie me immediately,

07:24.377 --> 07:27.414
every single person
at that hospital,

07:27.447 --> 07:31.084
starting with your cousin and
ending with Cindy, is gonna die.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.487
And it ain't gonna stop.

07:34.622 --> 07:37.424
(scoffs)
Creepy.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.759
(chuckles)

07:38.792 --> 07:40.160
MARCUS (quietly):
Idiots.

07:40.193 --> 07:41.995
You're wasting your time
with them.

07:42.029 --> 07:43.997
What do you think
I've been doing?

07:44.031 --> 07:45.999
Well, clearly,

07:46.033 --> 07:49.002
I don't know what you've
been doing, do I, Tomas?

07:49.036 --> 07:51.171
(sighs)

07:53.240 --> 07:55.208
(footsteps approaching)

08:03.483 --> 08:05.819
(hammering)

08:14.261 --> 08:15.529
Good morning!

08:15.563 --> 08:17.064
Hey.

08:17.097 --> 08:19.199
Sorry. I didn't mean
to scare you.

08:19.232 --> 08:21.368
(chuckles)
No.

08:21.401 --> 08:23.737
It's so quiet out here.

08:23.771 --> 08:25.873
Well, no teenagers
running around.

08:25.906 --> 08:28.876
-Yeah. -How'd you sleep? Was,
was the room too bright for you?

08:28.909 --> 08:30.544
-No. No, not at all. Thank you.
-Good.

08:30.578 --> 08:32.880
Thinking about putting
a couple more kids in that room.

08:34.582 --> 08:36.750
So, the incident last night...

08:36.784 --> 08:39.086
It was a complete anomaly.
The fact that it happened

08:39.119 --> 08:41.589
-while you were here is...
-Right, I know. Um,

08:41.622 --> 08:43.591
that said, the situation is...

08:43.624 --> 08:46.093
it-it's still worrisome.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.761
Caleb's fine. He wasn't hurt.

08:47.795 --> 08:49.730
Right. Thank goodness.

08:49.763 --> 08:52.600
But this whole island, it--
you don't think it's...

08:52.633 --> 08:57.037
just a little unlikely
that a visually impaired child

08:57.070 --> 08:59.539
just happens to wind up here

08:59.573 --> 09:02.242
on some rotted well cover?

09:03.777 --> 09:05.746
What are you getting at, Rose?

09:05.779 --> 09:09.216
I'm just trying to understand
what happened.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.286
(parakeet chirping loudly)

09:13.320 --> 09:15.288
TRUCK:
Caleb.

09:15.322 --> 09:18.626
Caleb, come on.
I need to get inside.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.127
SHELBY:
Hey, hey, hey.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.795
What's going on?

09:21.829 --> 09:24.431
I need to feed Morty.
He's hungry. Listen.

09:24.464 --> 09:27.200
(Morty chirping)

09:27.234 --> 09:29.970
(chuckles)
Look, don't worry, all right?

09:30.003 --> 09:31.571
Morty will be fine.

09:31.605 --> 09:34.474
Parakeets can go three
or four days without food.

09:34.507 --> 09:37.144
And Caleb needs a little time
to himself.

09:37.177 --> 09:38.646
He's not by himself.
Morty's in there.

09:38.679 --> 09:41.048
Yeah. And we'll get him
his food later.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.916
How 'bout you? You hungry?

09:42.950 --> 09:44.251
Maybe a little.

09:45.318 --> 09:47.420
VERITY:
Morning, men.

09:47.454 --> 09:48.756
TRUCK:
Can I put cookies on this?

09:48.789 --> 09:50.323
Yeah, live your life, Trucker.

09:50.357 --> 09:51.491
(knocking)

09:53.493 --> 09:56.897
-For you. -Freshly picked
from Holstrom Organic Farms.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.733
-SHELBY: Wow. Thank you,
Colleen. Thank you, Russ. -Hey.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.735
Oh, Shelby,
I wanted to mention that, uh,

10:01.769 --> 10:03.771
our ewe is about
to drop her lamb.

10:03.804 --> 10:06.106
And you said you were interested
in observing a birth.

10:06.139 --> 10:08.241
-Yeah, you sure that's okay?
-Yeah, of course.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.310
You come on over
this afternoon and, uh,

10:10.343 --> 10:12.145
we'll show you
the miracle of life.

10:12.179 --> 10:13.580
Cool. I'll be there.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.015
-Okay.
-All right.

10:16.549 --> 10:18.886
(creaking)

10:20.620 --> 10:22.322
JORDY:
Tell me what you gave her.

10:22.355 --> 10:23.356
Nothing.

10:23.390 --> 10:24.391
Don't lie to me.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.695
My cousin over there

10:27.728 --> 10:30.363
saw you in the store,
buying all kinds of supplies.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.766
It was saline and water.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.601
No. No, no, no. No more lies.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.637
She has suffered enough.

10:37.671 --> 10:40.774
A woman loses a child
like that...

10:40.808 --> 10:43.310
Now she's in intensive care.

10:43.343 --> 10:46.046
So I'm gonna ask you
one last time,

10:46.079 --> 10:48.716
what did you give my wife?

10:48.749 --> 10:51.618
MARCUS:
You're not wrong. You're not.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.621
There is a poison inside of her.

10:54.654 --> 10:58.625
And it's gonna fester and spread

10:58.658 --> 11:01.061
and tear her right in half,

11:01.094 --> 11:03.396
and there's nothing them doctors
can do to stop it.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.336
Just tell me what you did.

11:09.369 --> 11:12.205
And I won't ask why.

11:12.239 --> 11:15.709
So help me God, I will make sure
that you get out of here alive.

11:15.743 --> 11:18.178
(chuckles)
Why should God help you?

11:19.412 --> 11:21.148
What have you ever done for Him?

11:21.181 --> 11:22.750
Marcus.

11:22.783 --> 11:25.418
MARCUS:
The poison does have a name,

11:25.452 --> 11:27.687
(whispers):
and it's Lucifer.

11:27.721 --> 11:31.491
The morning star,
son of the dawn.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.360
The Devil has taken her,

11:33.393 --> 11:36.263
and you've gone and tied the
only antidote to a bloody post.

11:36.296 --> 11:39.166
We're not the ones killing
your wife, Sheriff!

11:39.199 --> 11:40.901
You are.

11:40.934 --> 11:43.103
TOMAS:
Please, please, listen to me!

11:43.136 --> 11:45.372
He is telling you
the truth. Please.

11:45.405 --> 11:46.907
Listen to me.

11:46.940 --> 11:49.542
The church Cindy goes to,
what does it look like?

11:49.576 --> 11:51.111
What?

11:51.144 --> 11:54.782
It has two picnic tables
side by side,

11:54.815 --> 11:58.551
a row of hedges and fields
of tall grass all around.

11:58.585 --> 12:02.622
And Cindy, she,
she has this radio,

12:02.655 --> 12:06.226
pink, with two stickers.

12:06.259 --> 12:09.396
She plays this song,

12:09.429 --> 12:12.165
and when she's happy,
she sings along.

12:15.002 --> 12:16.970
That's our old church.

12:17.004 --> 12:18.939
We haven't been there
for ten years.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.640
How the hell do you know
about the radio?

12:20.673 --> 12:24.444
It's where she goes
to feel safe.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.046
She is there right now,

12:26.079 --> 12:27.881
waiting for someone
to come and save her.

12:27.915 --> 12:31.551
I know how it sounds,
but please.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.021
-You have to trust me.
-Mm-hmm.

12:38.458 --> 12:41.061
* I go out walkin'

12:41.094 --> 12:44.932
* After midnight

12:44.965 --> 12:47.467
* Out in the moonlight.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.002
Uh-huh.

12:54.307 --> 12:57.010
(panting)

12:57.044 --> 12:58.979
She dies, you die.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.596
(Morty chirping)

13:16.629 --> 13:18.265
ROSE: Thank you for talking
with us, Caleb.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.699
No problem.

13:19.732 --> 13:21.835
Thanks for making me
feel like a prisoner.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.270
(quietly):
Caleb.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.671
Look, just, why are you guys
turning this

13:24.704 --> 13:26.173
into a big interrogation?

13:26.206 --> 13:28.541
I can see how it feels
like that,

13:28.575 --> 13:29.977
but we're just trying
to understand

13:30.010 --> 13:32.880
why you left the house
last night.

13:32.913 --> 13:36.316
Is it common for you to go out
into the woods in the dark?

13:36.349 --> 13:40.487
No. Normally, I wait for the sun
to come up so I can see.

13:44.057 --> 13:45.825
You know what I mean.

13:45.859 --> 13:48.195
I went for a walk.
That's all that happened.

13:48.228 --> 13:49.696
It might seem that way to you,

13:49.729 --> 13:50.998
but that's not
all that happened.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.399
You could have gotten hurt.

13:52.432 --> 13:54.501
-But I didn't.
-But you could have.

13:54.534 --> 13:57.370
And that's why we need to ask

13:57.404 --> 14:01.875
whether it's possible that maybe
you wanted to hurt yourself?

14:01.909 --> 14:04.011
ANDY: All right,
a little context here.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.046
Let's try to remember the kind
of day that Caleb had yesterday,

14:06.079 --> 14:07.647
the news about his father.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.117
Maybe he just wanted
to get out for a little bit.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.353
Is that true, Caleb?

14:13.386 --> 14:15.956
Is that why you went out
to the well all by yourself?

14:22.695 --> 14:25.532
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.634
ANDY:
All right.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.209
(heart monitor beeping)

14:36.243 --> 14:38.145
(Cindy panting)

14:40.413 --> 14:41.548
(whispers):
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.586
Can you hear me, baby?

14:50.590 --> 14:53.693
If you can hear me, just, uh,

14:53.726 --> 14:54.827
I don't know, just...

14:56.729 --> 14:59.166
...squeeze my hand.
Okay? Come on.

15:01.801 --> 15:05.072
(screaming)

15:05.105 --> 15:06.439
Help me!

15:06.473 --> 15:08.708
Help me in here, please!

15:08.741 --> 15:10.610
Cindy. It's all right.
Breathe, breathe.

15:10.643 --> 15:11.811
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

15:11.844 --> 15:13.780
(growling)

15:23.256 --> 15:25.792
I told you not
to engage the demon.

15:25.825 --> 15:27.627
Or let it into your head.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.062
We were running out of time.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.231
Oh, so that makes it
all right, does it?

15:31.264 --> 15:33.100
Chance damnation,
risk the girl's eternal soul,

15:33.133 --> 15:34.734
all 'cause you're on
some ticking clock?

15:34.767 --> 15:36.403
I can take care of myself.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.638
-What, like you did
with Casey Rance? -(sighs)

15:38.671 --> 15:41.108
Five minutes on your own, that
thing had you on your knees.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.275
That was a completely
different thing.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.311
I was a beginner back then.

15:44.344 --> 15:45.445
"Back then"?

15:45.478 --> 15:46.646
It was six months ago.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.848
That's nothing. That's a blink.

15:48.881 --> 15:50.984
You close your heart
and refuse to see the truth.

15:51.018 --> 15:52.785
Oh, yeah?
And what truth is that, then?

15:54.321 --> 15:57.357
That God gave me this gift.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.592
Oh, I see. It's God, is it?

15:59.626 --> 16:01.928
Wants you to spend a little
quality time with a demon?

16:01.961 --> 16:03.496
(scoffs)

16:03.530 --> 16:05.698
The last time I trusted
a vision, it led me to you.

16:05.732 --> 16:07.100
Was that also a mistake?

16:07.134 --> 16:09.402
It's starting
to feel like that, yeah.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.241
(exhales)

16:16.076 --> 16:17.844
-When I was a novice...
-I'm not a novice.

16:17.877 --> 16:20.447
No, just shut up
and listen to me.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.149
When I was training,
there were others

16:22.182 --> 16:24.317
that also took
unnecessary risks.

16:24.351 --> 16:27.220
All of them paid for it.

16:27.254 --> 16:28.588
I watched...

16:31.258 --> 16:33.193
I watched this friend...

16:35.162 --> 16:37.730
...walk into a room
with a demon,

16:37.764 --> 16:41.201
and not come out
for another six months.

16:41.234 --> 16:43.403
Ruined.

16:43.436 --> 16:46.206
'Cause that's what happens when
you let the darkness inside.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.543
You hate it.

16:53.012 --> 16:57.917
You hate the fact
that He chose me, and not you.

17:01.288 --> 17:03.223
(Tomas sighs)

17:05.858 --> 17:07.760
(phone ringing)

17:09.629 --> 17:11.598
Yeah?

17:29.482 --> 17:30.650
(knocking on door)

17:31.751 --> 17:33.720
Come in.

17:33.753 --> 17:34.921
-Hey.
-Hey.

17:34.954 --> 17:36.456
I've been looking for you.

17:36.489 --> 17:37.824
You found me.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.594
So, I know you probably don't
want to hear this,

17:41.628 --> 17:44.697
but I think you know
I'm obliged to file a report

17:44.731 --> 17:47.033
with DSHS in Seattle
about Caleb's incident.

17:47.066 --> 17:51.438
That's if you believe
he's seriously at risk here.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.540
You can't possibly think that.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.443
Honestly, I'm not entirely sure
what to think.

17:56.476 --> 17:58.077
Then why do it?

17:58.111 --> 17:59.646
You have discretion.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.750
Unless it's to cover your ass.

18:03.783 --> 18:06.386
Okay. This isn't about me,
all right?

18:06.419 --> 18:08.621
This is about the welfare
of a child.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.723
Then consider the child.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.592
Caleb's in a really good place.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.627
You file this report,
you jeopardize our entire home.

18:14.661 --> 18:15.828
You know that.

18:15.862 --> 18:17.764
Me filing this incident report

18:17.797 --> 18:19.799
-is separate from my final
assessment. -Do you think

18:19.832 --> 18:22.135
that the department is gonna
view those things separately?

18:24.871 --> 18:27.740
Andy, I sympathize
with your position,

18:27.774 --> 18:32.545
but I'm concerned that Caleb
may be trying to injure himself.

18:34.681 --> 18:37.184
And you know
the legal ramifications

18:37.217 --> 18:38.685
if that's the case.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.187
And if it is self-harm,
then Caleb

18:40.220 --> 18:42.355
-could be institutionalized.
-Exactly.

18:42.389 --> 18:43.790
And you know what happens
to kids with disabilities

18:43.823 --> 18:45.325
in places like that.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.827
No one is doubting
how much you care about him,

18:47.860 --> 18:50.797
but I-I don't think that
you are able to see clearly.

18:50.830 --> 18:54.634
Is it possible that maybe
you are not the best judge

18:54.667 --> 18:56.536
when it comes to spotting

18:56.569 --> 18:59.806
warning signs of depression
and self-harm?

18:59.839 --> 19:02.342
This has nothing to do with her.

19:02.375 --> 19:03.643
Really?

19:03.676 --> 19:05.412
Andy, because look around you.

19:06.579 --> 19:08.181
She's everywhere.

19:08.215 --> 19:10.383
I mean, this place is, like,
a shrine to Nicole.

19:10.417 --> 19:12.885
How are you...

19:12.919 --> 19:15.988
How are any of you supposed
to move on with your lives?

19:16.022 --> 19:17.757
(sighs)

19:21.828 --> 19:23.730
ROSE:
Andy.

19:29.536 --> 19:32.539
Grace, I'm sorry
you had to hear that.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.778
(door slams)

19:42.449 --> 19:44.417
(truck door opens, closes)

19:44.451 --> 19:46.386
(alarm blaring)

19:54.794 --> 19:56.729
Let's go.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.901
TOMAS:
What happened here?

20:01.934 --> 20:04.437
GREG:
Tried to get everyone out.

20:30.162 --> 20:31.764
MAN:
No!

20:31.798 --> 20:33.500
(pounding)

20:37.437 --> 20:39.539
(man screams)

20:39.572 --> 20:41.474
(growling)

20:42.742 --> 20:44.644
(hissing)

20:44.677 --> 20:46.779
(man screams)

20:55.922 --> 20:57.724
(bones cracking)

20:57.757 --> 20:58.925
(man choking)

20:58.958 --> 21:00.660
(demonic voice):
So sweet.

21:00.693 --> 21:03.530
Sweet like stolen candy.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.236
CARO:
You can't be surprised.

21:10.269 --> 21:13.272
This city's only currency
is patronage.

21:13.306 --> 21:16.643
That performance Cardinal
Guillot put on for the tribunal?

21:16.676 --> 21:18.277
Pure pageantry.

21:18.311 --> 21:20.313
He is protected.

21:20.347 --> 21:23.316
And I thought
you were protecting me.

21:23.350 --> 21:27.620
Perhaps you overestimate
my influence.

21:27.654 --> 21:30.957
While you were sequestered,
building your case,

21:30.990 --> 21:33.159
there has been
a concerted campaign

21:33.192 --> 21:35.294
to undermine
the Office of Exorcism.

21:35.328 --> 21:38.264
Dozens of our best have been
brought home from abroad,

21:38.297 --> 21:41.434
reassigned to duties
unbefitting their talents.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.870
You may have been slipping cases

21:43.903 --> 21:46.339
to Marcus Keane
and his neophyte,

21:46.373 --> 21:47.940
but the Church,

21:47.974 --> 21:50.543
the Church has not
approved a single exorcism

21:50.577 --> 21:52.512
in the last six months.

21:54.080 --> 21:57.283
I'm afraid they have
declared war.

21:57.316 --> 22:01.621
And we, we must respond in kind.

22:01.654 --> 22:04.190
What can I do?

22:04.223 --> 22:09.896
There are still those
loyal to the cause.

22:09.929 --> 22:13.900
Even if their methods
are somewhat disagreeable.

22:13.933 --> 22:16.503
Find her.

22:16.536 --> 22:18.270
Keep her safe.

22:19.872 --> 22:22.909
Try not to let her have a gun.

22:22.942 --> 22:25.144
You told the tribunal

22:25.177 --> 22:27.747
you had no idea
where Marcus and Tomas were.

22:27.780 --> 22:29.081
Was that true?

22:29.115 --> 22:31.551
Yes.

22:31.584 --> 22:34.754
And if you did know,
would you tell me?

22:38.290 --> 22:39.992
No.

22:40.026 --> 22:42.529
(laughs)

22:45.264 --> 22:46.666
(lights buzzing)

22:46.699 --> 22:48.000
(demonic voice):
You must know

22:48.034 --> 22:49.936
the Words of Consecration,
Priest.

22:49.969 --> 22:54.273
Say it with me.
"Take this, all of you,

22:54.306 --> 22:55.842
"and eat of it.

22:55.875 --> 22:58.010
"For this is my body

22:58.044 --> 23:01.147
which shall be given up
for you."

23:03.282 --> 23:05.752
-(man screaming)
-(spits)

23:06.653 --> 23:08.387
(man groaning)

23:08.421 --> 23:10.923
(demonic voice): "Take this,
all of you, and drink of it.

23:10.957 --> 23:13.426
For this is the chalice
of my blood."

23:13.460 --> 23:15.795
-Cindy?
-Oh...

23:15.828 --> 23:17.229
I know you're in there.

23:18.798 --> 23:20.600
Let the man go.

23:20.633 --> 23:23.102
(man gasping)

23:24.737 --> 23:27.940
(demonic voice):
If you insist.

23:27.974 --> 23:29.542
-No!
-No!

23:29.576 --> 23:31.010
(growls)

23:42.789 --> 23:45.792
Mmm.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.477
Geez, dude,

24:04.511 --> 24:07.146
is it that hard to find a glass?

24:08.981 --> 24:11.484
Man, you really
freaked everyone out yesterday.

24:12.885 --> 24:14.186
I was almost impressed.

24:14.220 --> 24:15.855
Leave me alone, Verity.

24:15.888 --> 24:17.356
Hey!

24:18.658 --> 24:20.727
What's your deal?

24:23.996 --> 24:26.999
Caleb!

24:27.033 --> 24:28.535
(quietly):
What the hell?

24:28.568 --> 24:31.103
-(ewe bleats)
-RUSS: So she's getting close.

24:31.137 --> 24:32.539
COLLEEN:
Watch for the water bag.

24:32.572 --> 24:35.274
So what happens
after the lamb's born?

24:35.307 --> 24:37.644
Well, then we wait for her
to deliver the placenta.

24:37.677 --> 24:39.111
RUSS:
Which she'll probably eat.

24:39.145 --> 24:40.479
You see, it's their instinct

24:40.513 --> 24:42.348
not to leave any evidence
of a birth

24:42.381 --> 24:45.017
to try and protect the young
from predators.

24:45.051 --> 24:46.819
Unless, of course,
you want a souvenir.

24:46.853 --> 24:49.856
-Uh, nah. I-I ate before I came.
-(Russ laughs)

24:49.889 --> 24:51.791
-Water bag broke.
-Oh, here we go. -(bleating)

24:51.824 --> 24:53.526
-Feels like
it's coming out breech. -Oh.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.061
-Is that bad?
-Uh, not necessarily.

24:55.094 --> 24:57.229
It just means
a little more work for us.

24:57.263 --> 24:59.298
Bring the rear legs forward.

24:59.331 --> 25:02.869
Okay, I got the fetlocks.

25:02.902 --> 25:05.171
-(Russ sighs)
-(ewe bellows in pain)

25:05.204 --> 25:08.174
-RUSS: Hold her down!
-(bellowing)

25:08.207 --> 25:10.076
(chuffing)

25:10.109 --> 25:13.546
-COLLEEN: Settle down.
Settle down. -(bleating loudly)

25:13.580 --> 25:15.548
Shelby, honey, maybe
you better go wait outside.

25:15.582 --> 25:17.249
No, I-I can help.
What's wrong?

25:17.283 --> 25:20.152
-She's in distress.
-I can see that, Colleen.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.221
Get it out quick.
If the cord breaks, it'll drown.

25:22.254 --> 25:25.057
-I'm trying!
-(chuffing and bleating)

25:25.091 --> 25:26.325
All right, come on.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.927
Uh-oh.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.663
(horse neighs loudly)

25:30.697 --> 25:32.231
Ah...

25:32.264 --> 25:34.000
COLLEEN:
Come on.

25:34.033 --> 25:36.368
-I got it.
-COLLEEN: All right.

25:36.402 --> 25:38.370
RUSS:
There it is.

25:38.404 --> 25:39.872
-(squishing)
-There we go.

25:39.906 --> 25:41.407
(Russ sighs)

25:42.709 --> 25:43.610
(horse neighs)

25:43.643 --> 25:46.713
(bleating)

25:50.249 --> 25:53.620
(screeching)

25:53.653 --> 25:55.755
-COLLEEN: Oh, my God!
-RUSS: What is this?!

25:55.788 --> 25:57.590
(neighing)

25:57.624 --> 26:00.026
(Colleen gasps, Russ whimpers)

26:00.059 --> 26:01.427
-(screeching)
-(Colleen gasps)

26:01.460 --> 26:03.062

Hey, Caleb. What's up?

Can we talk?

26:34.593 --> 26:36.495
Yeah. Yeah, come on in.

(Andy clears throat)

What's up?

26:47.606 --> 26:50.076
I want to say
sorry about before.

26:50.109 --> 26:53.579
Hey, there is no need
to apologize.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.481
It is completely understandable

26:55.514 --> 26:57.516
given what happened
with your father.

26:57.549 --> 26:58.985
It's not about him.

26:59.018 --> 27:01.153
Okay. What's it about?

27:01.187 --> 27:03.790
I didn't say anything
in front of Rose

27:03.823 --> 27:06.158
because I didn't want
to get anyone in trouble.

27:06.192 --> 27:07.960
You said not to talk about it.

27:07.994 --> 27:10.096
No one is in trouble.

27:10.129 --> 27:13.199
But I do need
to know what happened.

27:13.232 --> 27:15.301
Why were you on that well alone?

27:15.334 --> 27:16.703
I wasn't alone.

27:16.736 --> 27:18.170
I was with...

27:18.204 --> 27:19.605
I was with Verity.

27:19.638 --> 27:23.342
Verity?

27:23.375 --> 27:26.512
She made me go out there
on the well,

27:26.545 --> 27:30.449
stand up on it and count to ten.

27:30.482 --> 27:33.452
And she left me.

from wherever you are
as soon as possible.

38:28.073 --> 38:30.342
Understood. Why?

38:30.376 --> 38:31.643
The Vatican's been compromised.

38:31.677 --> 38:32.911
They'll be looking for you.

38:34.546 --> 38:35.947
-Have I been clear?
-(sighs)

38:35.981 --> 38:37.683
You have.

38:37.716 --> 38:39.317
How do I get in touch with you?

38:40.652 --> 38:42.554
You don't.

38:42.588 --> 38:44.523
I'll find you.

38:54.433 --> 38:56.402
(knocking on door)

38:57.569 --> 38:58.837
ROSE:
Come in.

38:58.870 --> 39:00.005
(door opens)

39:01.339 --> 39:03.409
Hey, are you busy?

39:03.442 --> 39:06.211
No. No.

39:09.848 --> 39:12.684
Um...

39:12.718 --> 39:14.853
I just wanted to tell you
that, uh...

39:16.455 --> 39:18.757
...that Caleb came
to talk to me.

39:18.790 --> 39:22.260
That's good. What did he say?

39:22.293 --> 39:26.498
He was so embarrassed about the
disruption that he had caused.

39:26.532 --> 39:28.767
Said he went
to the abandoned house

39:28.800 --> 39:30.168
'cause it's where
the kids hang out,

39:30.201 --> 39:32.604
it's like their secret fort,

39:32.638 --> 39:35.173
or something, and the well--
did not know this--

39:35.206 --> 39:37.042
I should have, um...

39:37.075 --> 39:39.511
but apparently,
standing on top of it is, like,

39:39.545 --> 39:41.780
some kind of ritual
that they do.

39:41.813 --> 39:44.583
It's this collective
bonding experience.

39:44.616 --> 39:47.619
So if anything,
maybe it's a sign of strength?

39:47.653 --> 39:48.787
You know?

39:51.322 --> 39:53.959
Anyway, they have promised me
no more silly rituals,

39:53.992 --> 39:56.795
and the well, you saw,
it has been boarded up.

39:58.597 --> 40:01.967
He's not suicidal, Rose.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.570
I hope you can trust me on that.

40:08.774 --> 40:10.742
Andy.

40:10.776 --> 40:12.110
Yeah.

40:12.143 --> 40:14.446
What I said earlier,
about Nicole?

40:14.480 --> 40:17.816
-I'm really sorry,
I-I had no right to... -No.

40:17.849 --> 40:19.985
No. You don't...

40:23.622 --> 40:26.525
You don't need to apologize.

40:28.927 --> 40:31.463
I'm really glad you're here.

40:32.864 --> 40:35.433
Me, too.

40:37.703 --> 40:40.271
Good night, Rose.

40:46.878 --> 40:48.814
(door closes)

41:03.294 --> 41:06.097
MARCUS:
* I go out walkin' *

41:06.131 --> 41:08.534
* After midnight

41:08.567 --> 41:11.469
* Out in the moonlight

41:11.503 --> 41:14.973
* Just like we used to do.

41:17.008 --> 41:19.811
I'm never gonna get that
out of my head now, am I?

41:19.845 --> 41:22.714
You just need something
to replace it.

41:22.748 --> 41:24.315
(radio crackles)

41:24.349 --> 41:26.184
(music begins playing)

41:26.217 --> 41:28.319
* For tears

41:28.353 --> 41:29.955
* Honey, it's too late...

41:29.988 --> 41:31.289
So...

41:31.322 --> 41:32.691
* Too late to cry...

41:32.724 --> 41:35.493
Where are we going?

41:35.527 --> 41:37.729
I've got a place in mind.

41:37.763 --> 41:39.330
* Too late

41:39.364 --> 41:42.734
* Oh, for begging me, baby

41:42.768 --> 41:45.036
* Honey, it's too late

41:45.070 --> 41:46.872
* Too late.

41:46.905 --> 41:48.840
-(imitates bird trilling)
-(Morty chirping)

41:52.711 --> 41:54.846
TRUCK:
(trills) Morty.

42:16.635 --> 42:18.570
(clattering)

42:30.315 --> 42:32.718
(door creaks)

42:32.751 --> 42:34.452
(insects chirping)

42:37.322 --> 42:39.257
Hello?

42:43.294 --> 42:45.230
(twigs snapping)

42:47.599 --> 42:51.136
(rustling)

42:51.169 --> 42:52.437
Hello?

42:52.470 --> 42:54.405
(rustling continues)

42:54.439 --> 42:56.574
Anybody there?

43:08.854 --> 43:10.288
SHELBY:
Andy.

43:10.321 --> 43:12.457
(gasps)

43:19.364 --> 43:23.568
It says in the Bible that
lamb's blood can protect a home.

43:23.601 --> 43:26.437
I didn't know what else to do.

43:30.976 --> 43:34.145
There's something in the woods.

44:22.660 --> 44:25.296
