00:01.990 --> 00:05.990
>> Announcer: Previously on "big
Audrey's constant game play

00:05.990 --> 00:09.990
turned whole house against her.

00:09.990 --> 00:10.410
>> All the mistrust
brother" --

00:10.410 --> 00:12.990
in this house has all been
planted by you.

00:12.990 --> 00:15.990
>> It hit the fan, point-blank,
end of period.

00:15.990 --> 00:18.990
>> Announcer: With Becky and
Shelli in charge -- Julie

00:18.990 --> 00:19.990
congratulations to Becky.

00:19.990 --> 00:20.990
Congratulations, Shelli.

00:20.990 --> 00:24.990
You are this week's second head
of household!

00:24.990 --> 00:28.990
>> Announcer: Becky assumed
Audrey was the obvious target.

00:28.990 --> 00:32.830
But Shelli had a different goal
this week.

00:32.830 --> 00:35.990
>> I know that Becky thinks that
I'm going to be on board to

00:35.990 --> 00:40.990
backdoor Audrey this week, but
my main plan to get rid of

00:40.990 --> 00:41.990
Da'vonne first.

00:41.990 --> 00:44.990
>> Announcer: Wanting to ensure
Da'vonne's demise, Clay and

00:44.990 --> 00:48.990
Shelli sought a pawn who would
throw the battle of the block.

00:48.990 --> 00:51.990
>> The only person is John.

00:51.990 --> 00:54.540
John is maybe not that strong of
a competitor.

00:54.540 --> 00:57.990
>> Announcer: So they thrilled
the dentist.

00:57.990 --> 01:02.950
>> If you go up there on the
block with da', throw the

01:02.950 --> 01:03.540
basket o. Basket.

01:03.540 --> 01:07.990
>> It's a tough call, am I going
to help these people?

01:07.990 --> 01:10.120
Like I'm really bad at
competitions or am I going to

01:10.120 --> 01:11.990
save myself to make sure I live
through the week.

01:11.990 --> 01:15.410
>> Announcer: At the nomination
ceremony, Becky put two pawns on

01:15.410 --> 01:15.990
the block.

01:15.990 --> 01:18.990
>> I nominated you Jason and you
Steve.

01:18.990 --> 01:20.990
>> Announcer: While Shelli put
her target and pawn in the line

01:20.990 --> 01:21.990
of fire.

01:21.990 --> 01:27.990
>> I've nominated you, John, and
you Da'vonne.

01:27.990 --> 01:30.990
Da', I'm simply protect iting
myself.

01:30.990 --> 01:34.990
>> Announcer: At the battle of
the block, Da'vonne's

01:34.990 --> 01:36.990
strategy --
>> this is the dumbest strategy

01:36.990 --> 01:39.990
that you could possibly do for
this competition.

01:39.990 --> 01:41.990
>> Announcer: Made it easy for
John to throw it.

01:41.990 --> 01:44.990
>> John and Da'vonne are doing
so terribly right now, it looks

01:44.990 --> 01:49.990
like my master plan might
actually be coming together.

01:49.990 --> 01:54.410
>> Announcer: In the end, Steve
and Jason framed up a victory.

01:54.410 --> 01:54.990
>> Yay!

01:54.990 --> 01:55.990
Ou won the battle of the
block.

01:55.990 --> 01:58.990
You are now safe this week.

01:58.990 --> 02:00.990
>> Announcer: Dethroning Becky
as head of household.

02:00.990 --> 02:04.990
Tonight -- it's all on the line
with the veto back in play.

02:04.990 --> 02:08.700
Will Da'vonne or John be saved
by the golden power?

02:08.700 --> 02:14.990
Find out right now on "big
brother"!

02:14.990 --> 02:27.990
>> When you see someone caught
in a train wreck, just th

02:27.990 --> 02:35.990
captioning funded by CBS
>> ooh.

03:05.950 --> 03:07.990
They're like conjoined twins.

03:07.990 --> 03:09.990
We have this lean on.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.830
Just won battle of the
block!

03:11.830 --> 03:12.540
Woo!

03:12.540 --> 03:13.540
Oh.

03:13.540 --> 03:14.830
We won things before.

03:14.830 --> 03:14.990
>> I know.

03:14.990 --> 03:22.290
We may look like tweedledee and
tweedledum right now.

03:22.290 --> 03:24.990
>> Who's tweedledee?

03:24.990 --> 03:27.290
I'm tweedledee is and you're
tweedledum.

03:27.290 --> 03:27.990
>> I won't argue with.

03:27.990 --> 03:30.990
You nice job.

03:30.990 --> 03:31.990
Uh-hmm, uh-hmm.

03:31.990 --> 03:36.990
Good job, John.

03:36.990 --> 03:39.990
You okay?

03:39.990 --> 03:40.120
Eah.

03:40.120 --> 03:43.000
I held up my end of the deal
to throw this competition.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.990
It's time to see if Shelli and
Clay hold up their end.

03:48.990 --> 03:52.990
>> If you're on "Big Brother,"
you have to eat Froot Loops.

03:52.990 --> 03:54.990
>> Becky's plan was to backdoor
Audrey.

03:54.990 --> 03:56.990
My plan was to send home da'.

03:56.990 --> 03:57.990
Guess what?

03:57.990 --> 03:59.990
I'm the head of household now.

03:59.990 --> 04:04.000
So it looks like we're going
with my plan.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.120
>> I feel bad for Becky.

04:05.120 --> 04:12.990
That was like the shortest --
>> only like four hours, man.

04:12.990 --> 04:17.990
So I've just been dethroned
as hoh and it's actually not

04:17.990 --> 04:17.990
that bad.

04:17.990 --> 04:20.990
I wanted to become hoh so I can
establish new relationships with

04:20.990 --> 04:23.990
people in the house, and I feel
like I got that done.

04:23.990 --> 04:24.990
It's under my belt.

04:24.990 --> 04:27.700
And now Shelli gets to do my
dirty work and get Audrey out of

04:27.700 --> 04:38.000
the house.

04:45.990 --> 04:46.990
>> Oh, God.

04:46.990 --> 04:47.290
Get it together.

04:47.290 --> 04:49.990
Get it together.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.830
Oh, these people make me sick.

04:51.830 --> 04:52.990
Get it together.

04:52.990 --> 04:53.990
Get it together.

04:53.990 --> 04:55.990
Get it together.

04:55.990 --> 04:59.120
I'm sure he threw that b.O.B.

04:59.120 --> 05:00.290
I'm positive.

05:00.290 --> 05:01.990
I was carrying John.

05:01.990 --> 05:03.990
He didn't come up with a
strategy.

05:03.990 --> 05:07.990
He wouldn't communicate with me.

05:07.990 --> 05:08.990
Get it together.

05:08.990 --> 05:09.540
Get it together.

05:09.540 --> 05:11.990
Get it together.

05:11.990 --> 05:15.990
Ooh, I wish I could have worked
by my damn self!

05:15.990 --> 05:23.290
I'm so pissed off because I feel
like this house is really legit

05:23.290 --> 05:27.990
working as a unit trying to get
me outta here.

05:27.990 --> 05:33.700
All right.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.990
>> Hey.

05:42.990 --> 05:44.830
I didn't do anything.

05:44.830 --> 05:46.990
(Laughter)
>> Oh.

05:46.990 --> 05:49.990
Oh, look at us in our yellow.

05:49.990 --> 05:50.990
>> She had such a bad strategy.

05:50.990 --> 05:54.410
I was like, let's go with it.

05:54.410 --> 05:56.120
>> Are you okay?

05:56.120 --> 05:56.950
Yeah.

05:56.950 --> 06:02.700
Yeah.

06:02.700 --> 06:03.990
>> Keeping -- you seemed upset.

06:03.990 --> 06:04.830
You're good.

06:04.830 --> 06:08.830
I would go home before you went
home.

06:08.830 --> 06:12.990
Dude, I'm telling 2, like, and
you're not going to be another

06:12.990 --> 06:14.990
expendable pawn.

06:14.990 --> 06:15.290
>> Yeah.

06:15.290 --> 06:19.990
Everything about this is
weird.

06:19.990 --> 06:22.990
These are two people I don't
know well but I'll play along

06:22.990 --> 06:25.700
because I really don't have any
other choice.

06:25.700 --> 06:26.990
>> Thanks, darling.

06:26.990 --> 06:27.830
Thanks.

06:27.830 --> 06:30.000
We're excited.

06:30.000 --> 06:30.990
>> Yeah!

06:30.990 --> 06:32.000
Congratulations.

06:32.000 --> 06:32.990
Yeah.

06:32.990 --> 06:34.990
For not winning the b.O.B.

06:34.990 --> 06:35.290
(Laughter).

06:35.290 --> 06:38.950
>> Absolutely.

06:46.290 --> 06:49.120
Being hoh definitely has its
perks.

06:49.120 --> 06:51.990
>> Come here.

06:51.990 --> 06:57.990
I'm going to sleep in my top
shirt.

06:57.990 --> 07:04.990
>> Look at your hot body.

07:04.990 --> 07:05.990
I'm happy for.

07:05.990 --> 07:08.410
You I'm happy too.

07:08.410 --> 07:09.990
You and Steve killed it.

07:09.990 --> 07:11.990
I feel bad for Da'vonne,
though.

07:11.990 --> 07:13.990
>> It is a relief for me to be
safe this week.

07:13.990 --> 07:16.990
Granted, I'll still worried
about my girl Da'vonne sitting

07:16.990 --> 07:17.990
up on the block.

07:17.990 --> 07:21.990
>> You do know if someone wins
that veto that's not on our home

07:21.990 --> 07:25.990
team, da's probably as good as
gone.

07:25.990 --> 07:29.540
>> Unless they decide to try to
backdoor somebody else.

07:29.540 --> 07:32.990
>> Can you imagine if Audrey and
da'.

07:32.990 --> 07:34.990
>> Ooh, God.

07:34.990 --> 07:35.990
Clash of the titans.

07:35.990 --> 07:38.990
That would be a main fight.

07:38.990 --> 07:41.000
Basically no one is talking
game to me right now.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.990
That's suspicious to me.

07:42.990 --> 07:46.990
So any opportunity I can to
eavesdrop.

07:46.990 --> 07:49.990
You bet your bottom dollar I
take it.

07:49.990 --> 07:53.990
>> Everyone prayed to bb gods,
though, that Shelli will get

07:53.990 --> 07:54.290
Audrey out.

07:54.290 --> 07:57.540
>> I seriously think Shelli's
going to do --

07:57.540 --> 07:58.290
>> what the house wants?

07:58.290 --> 08:01.990
I think she's going to
backdoor Audrey.

08:01.990 --> 08:04.120
>> If any of these people get
the opportunity to compete in

08:04.120 --> 08:07.000
these veto competition and they
win, I could be the sacrificial

08:07.000 --> 08:07.990
lamb this week.

08:07.990 --> 08:09.290
>> I hope so.

08:09.290 --> 08:12.120
Don't think she's going to
send da' home over Audrey

08:12.120 --> 08:12.950
first.

08:12.950 --> 08:13.990
I mean, that's just me.

08:13.990 --> 08:15.990
>> Right.

08:15.990 --> 08:16.990
I hope not.

08:16.990 --> 08:29.540
You know Audrey will say
anything she can.

08:29.540 --> 08:30.990
>> Okay.

08:30.990 --> 08:32.700
Okay so are we on the block?

08:32.700 --> 08:36.290
>> No.

08:36.290 --> 08:38.990
I didn't win hoh.

08:38.990 --> 08:39.990
Shelli won.

08:39.990 --> 08:40.990
It was Becky and Shelli which
was perfect.

08:40.990 --> 08:43.830
>> I can't believe Becky did so
good in the competition.

08:43.830 --> 08:45.990
I can't believe you did good.

08:45.990 --> 08:46.990
>> Dude, stop.

08:46.990 --> 08:47.990
Don't put pressure on me.

08:47.990 --> 08:48.990
I'm good at puzzles.

08:48.990 --> 08:51.990
>> I was like, oh, my God, if
we're on the block, I'm going to

08:51.990 --> 08:52.990
kill her.

08:52.990 --> 08:53.950
>> No.

08:53.950 --> 08:56.830
Shelli puts up da' and John.

08:56.830 --> 08:56.990
>> Good.

08:56.990 --> 08:57.990
She put up da'.

08:57.990 --> 09:01.990
>> Da' like if she gets
nominate she's like uh-hmm.

09:01.990 --> 09:01.990
>> I love da'.

09:01.990 --> 09:03.990
I love da'.

09:03.990 --> 09:09.120
>> Oh, I love you.

09:16.990 --> 09:17.990
Ew!

09:17.990 --> 09:18.990
Oh, my God.

09:18.990 --> 09:26.990
This is disgusting.

09:26.990 --> 09:29.410
I can't breathe.

09:29.410 --> 09:31.000
>> Good morning, honey.

09:31.000 --> 09:31.830
Hey.

09:31.830 --> 09:34.990
How was your sleep?

09:34.990 --> 09:37.990
>> They called me into the diary
room at like 7:00 A.M.

09:37.990 --> 09:39.990
>> I went like 20 minutes ago.

09:39.990 --> 09:41.990
I want to go back to sleep.

09:41.990 --> 09:43.410
Running on fumes.

09:43.410 --> 09:48.410
>> Exactly.

09:48.410 --> 09:48.990
Hey, everyone.

09:48.990 --> 09:53.990
It's time to pick players for
the veto competition.

09:53.990 --> 10:00.990
(Screams)
>> Only six people will

10:00.990 --> 10:02.990
participate in the veto
competition.

10:02.990 --> 10:08.990
The head of household, the two
nominates nominees and three

10:08.990 --> 10:10.990
other players selected by random
drew.

10:10.990 --> 10:14.410
About l the nominees please join
me up here.

10:14.410 --> 10:16.990
I as head of household and the
two nominees will each pull a

10:16.990 --> 10:19.990
chip out of the box to determine
the three other players

10:19.990 --> 10:21.990
competing in the veto
competition.

10:21.990 --> 10:25.990
>> I would love the opportunity
to compete because that would

10:25.990 --> 10:29.990
guarantee my safety.

10:29.990 --> 10:32.990
If mama "d" comes off the block,
there's a hot chance I go on it.

10:32.990 --> 10:36.000
And I go on it, there's 100%
chance I'm shipping out.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.990
>> As hoh, I will pick first.

10:39.990 --> 10:41.990
My target this week is
Da'vonne.

10:41.990 --> 10:43.990
So I'm really hoping to pick
someone who's gonna help me keep

10:43.990 --> 10:48.990
the nominations the same.

10:48.990 --> 10:53.990
Houseguest choice.

10:53.990 --> 11:00.950
I pick Clay.

11:00.950 --> 11:00.990
>> Shelli picks Clay.

11:00.990 --> 11:02.990
Big surprise.

11:02.990 --> 11:04.990
Hercules and the princess are
both playing.

11:04.990 --> 11:05.990
How predictable.

11:05.990 --> 11:14.990
(Applause)
Mr.

11:14.990 --> 11:15.700
>> Meg.

11:15.700 --> 11:23.990
Yeah!

11:23.990 --> 11:25.990
I know if I pick Jason.

11:25.990 --> 11:29.000
Jason is going to bust his butt
out here to try to win this veto

11:29.000 --> 11:32.990
and make sure I stay safe.

11:32.990 --> 11:34.990
That's my righta die to the end.

11:34.990 --> 11:36.290
Is he going to fight for me.

11:36.290 --> 11:37.990
>> Steve.

11:37.990 --> 11:40.990
I picked damn Steve.

11:40.990 --> 11:41.000
Yeah.

11:41.000 --> 11:51.830
(Applause)
>> I also have to choose a host

11:51.830 --> 11:55.990
for the veto competition, and I
choose Jack.

11:55.990 --> 11:56.990
-- Jackie.

11:56.990 --> 11:57.990
(Cheers and applause).

11:57.990 --> 12:00.990
>> I'm feeling pretty good about
who was drawn for pov.

12:00.990 --> 12:03.290
As long as we can keep the
nominations the same, Da'vonne

12:03.290 --> 12:05.290
should be going home this week.

12:05.290 --> 12:07.990
"Big Brother" will inform us
when the competition is to

12:07.990 --> 12:07.990
begin.

12:07.990 --> 12:08.990
Good luck.

12:08.990 --> 12:16.990
(Applause)
>> What's on your mind?

12:18.950 --> 12:32.990
Because I can tell something is.

12:32.990 --> 12:41.990
>> You get one shot in this game
and you got to understand that

12:41.990 --> 12:45.990
we -- but you really need to
take on this week and don't do

12:45.990 --> 12:47.410
anything to jeopardize that.

12:47.410 --> 12:49.000
>> You don't have to convince
me.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.990
I've been everybody's friend.

12:50.990 --> 12:53.990
>> Clay's ensuring me that I'm
safe, and that's great news,

12:53.990 --> 12:58.120
because five minutes ago, I was
public enemy number one.

12:58.120 --> 13:03.120
Sure, Clay, whatever it takes,
thunder buns.

13:03.120 --> 13:18.990
No worries.

13:18.990 --> 13:22.290
>> If they try to get me out of
here, the house is split.

13:22.290 --> 13:24.990
>> It's imperative that she wins
this veto.

13:24.990 --> 13:27.990
>> I don't think Meg would
change the nominations at all

13:27.990 --> 13:29.990
because she doesn't want to step
on anybody's toes.

13:29.990 --> 13:30.990
>> Oh, yeah.

13:30.990 --> 13:32.990
Steve for sure isn't going to
change the nominations.

13:32.990 --> 13:34.990
He's going to leave them the
same.

13:34.990 --> 13:42.540
Clay is not going to take me
off.

13:42.540 --> 13:43.990
>> People in this house are
cowards.

13:43.990 --> 13:47.990
And they'd rather tiptoe around
them and that's why I'm getting

13:47.990 --> 13:50.990
put up because I called out
Audrey.

13:50.990 --> 13:52.540
People got scared.

13:52.540 --> 13:55.950
>> So it will be very
interesting to see how this veto

13:55.950 --> 13:55.990
works.

13:55.990 --> 13:56.990
>> I have to win.

13:56.990 --> 13:58.990
I have to secure my safety.

14:11.990 --> 14:12.000
>> Hey, guys!

14:12.000 --> 14:15.990
It's time for the veto
competition.

14:15.990 --> 14:21.990
(Cheers and applause)
Get your heads together and meet

14:21.990 --> 14:26.990
me out back stat.

14:26.990 --> 14:28.990
The stakes are ridiculously
high.

14:28.990 --> 14:31.830
Nobody who got picked for the
veto is fighting for me.

14:31.830 --> 14:32.990
It's kill or be killed.

14:32.990 --> 14:38.990
>> Audrey's name did not get
pulled for the power of veto

14:38.990 --> 14:42.990
competition meaning Shelli and I
can still back-door her this

14:42.990 --> 14:43.000
week.

14:43.000 --> 14:43.990
>> I'm going to draw names.

14:43.990 --> 14:45.990
This person will step up and
challenge another player to go

14:45.990 --> 14:47.990
head to head with.

14:47.990 --> 14:54.000
You will then hear Kathy list
seven items that she's asked her

14:54.000 --> 14:54.990
assistant to bring.

14:54.990 --> 14:57.990
The problem is the assistant is
completely overwhelmed.

14:57.990 --> 15:01.990
So when the elevator door
opens , she will be missing one

15:01.990 --> 15:01.990
item.

15:01.990 --> 15:05.990
Your job is to recognize what's
missing, then run into the

15:05.990 --> 15:07.990
dressing room and retrieve it.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.990
The first player to run back and
hit their button with the

15:10.990 --> 15:13.990
correct item will win the round.

15:13.990 --> 15:18.120
However, if you hit your button
first and have the wrong item --

15:18.120 --> 15:20.700
(buzzer)
-- Your opponent will win.

15:20.700 --> 15:26.120
We will play rounds until --
five rounds until only one

15:26.120 --> 15:29.990
player earns them the power of
veto.

15:29.990 --> 15:32.990
Are you guys ready to play high
maintenance?

15:32.990 --> 15:35.990
Let's see who will be competing
in round one.

15:35.990 --> 15:36.990
John!

15:36.990 --> 15:42.990
(Applause)
>> They say the pawn always goes

15:42.990 --> 15:42.990
home.

15:42.990 --> 15:47.990
I have to win this veto because
the only way I know I'm good for

15:47.990 --> 15:51.540
sure is to take the veto home.

15:51.540 --> 15:53.000
>> Who do you want to challenge,
John?

15:53.000 --> 15:56.990
>> I challenge my block buddy
mama da'.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.990
>> When John picked me, I
immediately get pissed.

15:59.990 --> 16:00.990
Let's do it.

16:00.990 --> 16:01.990
I have to fight.

16:01.990 --> 16:04.990
Period.

16:04.990 --> 16:07.000
>> Oh, listen up, interns!

16:07.000 --> 16:09.990
You know you're not allowed
to look directly at me.

16:09.990 --> 16:12.990
Just listen to the sound of my
beautiful voice.

16:12.990 --> 16:17.990
Bring me my hairless cat, a pair
of swim fins, a kite, a framed

16:17.990 --> 16:22.950
photo of Jody, a unicycle, a
kitty pool, and a bottle of

16:22.950 --> 16:24.290
champagne with a straw attached
to it.

16:24.290 --> 16:30.700
Is that too much to ask?!

16:30.700 --> 16:33.990
>> In this competition, we have
to listen to a list of several

16:33.990 --> 16:36.990
items and when the elevator
open, we have to bring back the

16:36.990 --> 16:39.990
item that the assistant is
missing.

16:39.990 --> 16:43.290
First person to buzz in with the
correct item wins the round.

16:43.290 --> 16:46.990
The last person standing after
five rounds wins the power of

16:46.990 --> 16:49.990
veto.

16:49.990 --> 16:53.990
I grab this pool, and I run
back, and I'm like, oh, she's

16:53.990 --> 16:55.000
standing in the pool.

16:55.000 --> 16:55.990
I see a kitty.

16:55.990 --> 16:57.990
I see Jody's picture.

16:57.990 --> 16:58.990
And I see the champagne bottle.

16:58.990 --> 17:04.990
What am I missing?

17:04.990 --> 17:07.990
>> I'm still trying to figure
out what was it that Kathy

17:07.990 --> 17:10.990
wanted?

17:10.990 --> 17:11.990
Then bam.

17:11.990 --> 17:13.990
Unicycle!

17:13.990 --> 17:13.990
Da'vonne takes off.

17:13.990 --> 17:17.990
I'm thinking, I can't let her
come out with that unicycle

17:17.990 --> 17:22.990
before me because I have to win
this battle of veto.

17:22.990 --> 17:25.990
The brightly colored thing is
right there.

17:25.990 --> 17:31.990
(Ding)
>> Yeah, John.

17:31.990 --> 17:32.990
John, you have brought back
the correct item and remain in

17:32.990 --> 17:33.990
the game.

17:33.990 --> 17:35.990
I'm sorry, Da'vonne.

17:35.990 --> 17:40.120
You are out.

17:40.120 --> 17:43.990
>> Losing the veto is a terrible
feeling.

17:43.990 --> 17:46.990
The only thing I have left is to
root for John.

17:46.990 --> 17:50.290
John has to win because John has
to take his self off of the

17:50.290 --> 17:53.990
block so that Audrey can go up
next to me.

17:53.990 --> 17:54.990
>> All right, John.

17:54.990 --> 17:58.950
Who are you going to make play
in round two?

17:58.950 --> 18:01.990
>> Steve, come on up.

18:01.990 --> 18:02.290
Ie!

18:02.290 --> 18:02.990
(Applause).

18:02.990 --> 18:04.990
>> Steve, who would you like to
challenge?

18:04.990 --> 18:06.990
>> I would like to challenge
Clay.

18:06.990 --> 18:07.990
(Applause).

18:07.990 --> 18:09.990
>> Even though da's already
out of this competition, I still

18:09.990 --> 18:14.990
want to win this veto for myself
to keep the noms the same and so

18:14.990 --> 18:17.990
I don't get any blood on my
hands.

18:17.990 --> 18:22.990
>> Bring me a pet orangutan, a
roll of toilet paper, a rubber

18:22.990 --> 18:29.990
ducky, a box of os cereal,
sunglasses and a zebra striped

18:29.990 --> 18:29.990
pillow.

18:29.990 --> 18:34.990
Is that too much to ask?

18:34.990 --> 18:36.990
>> Once I figure out that it's
the rubber ducky that's missing,

18:36.990 --> 18:42.990
it's on.

18:42.990 --> 18:49.000
I run and snag the rubber ducky,
step on the large, and made my

18:49.000 --> 18:51.990
way to the veto podium.

18:51.990 --> 18:55.410
(Ding)
I swear I was having flashbacks

18:55.410 --> 19:01.410
to my first interception at
Texas a&m Texas a&m.

19:01.410 --> 19:01.990
(Cheers).

19:01.990 --> 19:03.990
[ Whistle ]
>> Clay, you were first to bring

19:03.990 --> 19:04.990
back the right item.

19:04.990 --> 19:07.700
I'm sorry Steve, you've been
eliminated.

19:07.700 --> 19:09.990
>> I'm completely okay losing to
delay because I didn't want to

19:09.990 --> 19:11.990
win this competition anyways.

19:11.990 --> 19:14.990
I'm already tied for the most
competition wins with two so far

19:14.990 --> 19:17.990
and I do not want to put any
more attention on myself.

19:17.990 --> 19:21.990
>> Clay, who are you going to
make play in round three?

19:21.990 --> 19:21.990
>> Wonderful Meg.

19:21.990 --> 19:23.990
Yeah.

19:23.990 --> 19:26.950
(Cheers)
>> Ooh.

19:26.950 --> 19:26.990
(Laughter).

19:26.990 --> 19:30.950
>> I am feeling safe this week,
dare I say.

19:30.950 --> 19:31.990
And I'm not winning this
competition.

19:31.990 --> 19:34.700
I'm throwing every part of it.

19:34.700 --> 19:35.990
>> All right, Meg.

19:35.990 --> 19:37.990
Who would you like to go head to
head with?

19:37.990 --> 19:38.990
>> My girl, Shelli.

19:38.990 --> 19:39.990
Woo!

19:39.990 --> 19:42.990
I picked Shelli because it's
very believable that she would

19:42.990 --> 19:45.990
beat me in this competition.

19:45.990 --> 19:49.990
Ishe's an interior designer.

19:49.990 --> 19:52.540
She should be very good with the
details.

19:52.540 --> 19:54.990
>> If Shelli or Clay with iwin
this, the nominations will stay

19:54.990 --> 19:55.990
the same.

19:55.990 --> 19:58.990
If John wins the veto, then he's
going to take himself off the

19:58.990 --> 20:00.990
block, and then there's a
possibility that I could be

20:00.990 --> 20:04.990
sitting next to mama demon.

20:04.990 --> 20:09.990
>> You bring me a piñata, a new
toilet seat, my rhinestone

20:09.990 --> 20:13.990
microphone, a sombrero, a bunny
rabbit, a can of tomato sauce, a

20:13.990 --> 20:16.990
bunch of carrots for my
superfood smoothie.

20:16.990 --> 20:18.990
Is that too much to ask?

20:18.990 --> 20:23.410
♪
>> the elevator opens up and I'm

20:23.410 --> 20:26.990
going through the items in my
head and I'm thinking, she said

20:26.990 --> 20:26.990
microphone.

20:26.990 --> 20:28.700
There's not a microphone on the
board.

20:28.700 --> 20:39.990
I'm going to go grab the
microphone.

20:39.990 --> 20:43.990
(Buzzer)
>> Shelli, you are first to ring

20:43.990 --> 20:44.540
in.

20:44.540 --> 20:44.990
I'm sorry.

20:44.990 --> 20:46.990
That is incorrect.

20:46.990 --> 20:49.990
The item the intern needed was a
sombrero.

20:49.990 --> 20:52.990
You have been eliminated.

20:52.990 --> 20:58.410
>> When I see Shelli has the
microphone, I am so annoyed and

20:58.410 --> 21:03.000
all I can think of is, it's the
sombrero!

21:03.000 --> 21:06.990
How did you get to be hoh?

21:06.990 --> 21:12.990
>> Meg, who are you going to
make play?

21:12.990 --> 21:13.990
>> John.

21:13.990 --> 21:13.990
Okay.

21:13.990 --> 21:16.990
John, who to you want to battle
against in this round?

21:16.990 --> 21:18.290
>> Meg, come back over, lady.

21:18.290 --> 21:18.990
Yeah, baby.

21:18.990 --> 21:21.990
Let's do this.

21:21.990 --> 21:23.410
>> How many emmys do you have?

21:23.410 --> 21:24.950
Well, I have two.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.540
So get me what I want.

21:26.540 --> 21:31.990
A pink feather boa, a box of
corn starch to remove my skinny

21:31.990 --> 21:35.990
jeans, a watermelon, a Teddy
bear, a pair of white and pink

21:35.990 --> 21:38.990
roller skates, my pet snake and
my red punching bag.

21:38.990 --> 21:45.990
Is that too much to ask?

21:45.990 --> 21:49.990
>> Kathy said she needed corn
starch to put her pants on or

21:49.990 --> 21:49.990
something.

21:49.990 --> 21:52.990
I don't know.

21:52.990 --> 21:55.990
I just like dashed right for it,
grabbed it, brought back out,

21:55.990 --> 21:59.990
and Meg hadn't even moved yet.

21:59.990 --> 22:00.700
>> Corn starch.

22:00.700 --> 22:02.990
You're welcome, Johnny Mac.

22:02.990 --> 22:04.410
John, you have brought back
the correct item.

22:04.410 --> 22:04.990
I'm sorry, Meg.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.990
You have been eliminated.

22:06.990 --> 22:08.120
>> John just knocked out Meg.

22:08.120 --> 22:09.830
And I'm like, all right, John.

22:09.830 --> 22:10.990
Come on, pull this out.

22:10.990 --> 22:13.990
All you got to do is beat Clay
because I don't like him anyway.

22:13.990 --> 22:16.990
And at this point, you can win
the veto, take yourself off the

22:16.990 --> 22:18.990
block and we can have a
replacement.

22:18.990 --> 22:23.990
>> That leaves John and Clay in
the fifth and final round.

22:23.990 --> 22:24.990
>> This is it.

22:24.990 --> 22:26.990
All that's left is me and Clay.

22:26.990 --> 22:29.290
There's a chance I could go home
unless I win something that

22:29.290 --> 22:31.990
says, hey, I'm safe, don't touch
this guy.

22:31.990 --> 22:34.990
>> The player who wins this
final round will win the golden

22:34.990 --> 22:37.950
power of veto.

22:37.950 --> 22:39.990
>> There's no greater gift than
watching me act.

22:39.990 --> 22:44.540
But you will never see it again
unless I get a trampoline, an

22:44.540 --> 22:49.120
oversized beachball, an
inflatable giraffe, a squirrel

22:49.120 --> 22:53.540
statue, a box of wine, my pet
byrne and a bottle of pooch

22:53.540 --> 22:54.830
drinking water for my dog.

22:54.830 --> 22:59.990
Is that too much to ask?

22:59.990 --> 23:02.990
>> The elevator opened and I'm
like where where's the giraffe?

23:02.990 --> 23:06.120
You can't fit a giraffe in an
elevator.

23:06.120 --> 23:07.830
I got to win this for me.

23:07.830 --> 23:11.990
I'm going for it.

23:11.990 --> 23:12.990
>> Yeah!

23:12.990 --> 23:15.290
(Applause)
>> John, that is correct.

23:15.290 --> 23:22.830
And you have won the golden
power of veto.

23:22.830 --> 23:22.990
>> Yeah.

23:22.990 --> 23:25.990
Thank you.

23:25.990 --> 23:28.120
Johnny Mac pulling out the
veto.

23:28.120 --> 23:33.990
I love it.

23:33.990 --> 23:35.000
>> John has won the veto.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.990
Now my only hope is that Shelli
can put Audrey on the block next

23:38.990 --> 23:38.990
to me.

23:38.990 --> 23:40.990
That is the only option that I
have left.

23:40.990 --> 23:42.410
>> Thank you.

23:42.410 --> 23:42.990
Congratulations to John.

23:42.990 --> 23:44.990
He won the pov.

23:44.990 --> 23:46.990
But I'm suddenly in a position
that I didn't think I was going

23:46.990 --> 23:47.990
to be in.

23:47.990 --> 23:49.990
Now I'm going to have to put up
a replacement nominee.

23:58.990 --> 23:59.990
>> Julie: Can't get enough of
Big Brother?

23:59.990 --> 24:00.830
>> There is never a dull moment.

24:00.830 --> 24:02.830
Julie: See what's happening
inside the house

24:02.830 --> 24:03.990
whenever you want with the live
feed on CBS.Com.

24:03.990 --> 24:09.410
>> You know you want to watch.

24:21.990 --> 24:22.410
Okay.

24:22.410 --> 24:22.990
Let's talk about the options.

24:22.990 --> 24:25.000
>> We got to get da' out.

24:25.000 --> 24:42.990
This is the best move for your
game.

24:42.990 --> 24:47.540
If we get the people who we
trust and say, look, Johnny's

24:47.540 --> 24:50.540
not going to use the veto and I
want you all to give him your

24:50.540 --> 24:52.990
word that you-all are going to
vote him out.

24:52.990 --> 24:56.990
They all like him.

24:56.990 --> 24:59.990
>> Everyone right now is
thinking I'm going to back-door

24:59.990 --> 24:59.990
Audrey.

24:59.990 --> 25:00.990
>> No, no.

25:00.990 --> 25:02.990
Everybody who wants Audrey
out.

25:02.990 --> 25:04.990
>> Who's everyone?

25:04.990 --> 25:04.990
Becky?

25:04.990 --> 25:07.990
You talk to Becky, say, hey,
listen, you have to respect my

25:07.990 --> 25:08.540
game.

25:08.540 --> 25:09.990
>> I'm going to go get her right
now.

25:09.990 --> 25:13.000
>> Bmç
the target right now but I'm

25:13.000 --> 25:14.290
worried about Becky.

25:14.290 --> 25:18.410
I want to make sure she knows
I'm not planning on back-dooring

25:18.410 --> 25:18.990
Audrey.

25:18.990 --> 25:20.700
And I got to make sure that
she's on board with this.

25:20.700 --> 25:25.540
I know that your main target is
Audrey.

25:25.540 --> 25:27.990
I know at love people feel that
way in the house.

25:27.990 --> 25:30.990
My target who I think would be
gunning for me the most is day.

25:30.990 --> 25:33.990
If I put Audrey up now against
da' --

25:33.990 --> 25:35.990
>> Audrey will go home.

25:35.990 --> 25:38.990
And then
da's going to come gunnin' for

25:38.990 --> 25:38.990
me.

25:38.990 --> 25:41.990
>> The only reason that makes me
so nervous is I don't trust

25:41.990 --> 25:43.990
Audrey because she manipulates
and two more weeks in the house

25:43.990 --> 25:48.990
that she could run around and
say Becky hates this, that and

25:48.990 --> 25:51.990
the other person.

25:51.990 --> 25:58.950
>> We feel about da' how you
feel about Audrey. Since the

25:58.950 --> 26:00.990
blowup with me.

26:00.990 --> 26:02.990
>> I thought were you one of the
closest people in the house.

26:02.990 --> 26:04.290
>> I thought were you too.

26:04.290 --> 26:05.990
She's gunnin' for us.

26:05.990 --> 26:09.540
You have a chance to win hoh
again next week which I don't.

26:09.540 --> 26:11.120
>> And this is kind of a trust
thing.

26:11.120 --> 26:12.830
You have to trust us right here.

26:12.830 --> 26:12.990
>> Yep.

26:12.990 --> 26:12.990
In this situation.

26:12.990 --> 26:16.990
And next week, you know, we're
going to trust you.

26:16.990 --> 26:18.120
>> Shelli's just changed the
plan on me.

26:18.120 --> 26:22.950
If Shelli and Clay want to get
the dirt on their hands that's

26:22.950 --> 26:24.990
one more person out of the house
and next week the house could

26:24.990 --> 26:25.990
still focus on taking out
Audrey.

26:25.990 --> 26:27.540
>> We trust you guys.

26:27.540 --> 26:28.990
I do trust your game planning.

26:28.990 --> 26:29.540
>> Are you happy?

26:29.540 --> 26:30.290
You asol.

26:30.290 --> 26:37.990
Okay.

26:39.990 --> 26:43.990
I know one thing.

26:43.990 --> 26:45.990
Didn't win the power of
veto.

26:45.990 --> 26:46.990
That's okay.

26:46.990 --> 26:47.990
I'm going to keep a cool head.

26:47.990 --> 26:48.990
I'm not going to erupt.

26:48.990 --> 26:49.990
But stay tuned.

26:49.990 --> 26:50.990
I got more to come.

26:50.990 --> 26:52.990
You have not seep the last of me
yet.

26:52.990 --> 26:54.830
I am a fighter, and I will get
through this.

26:54.830 --> 26:55.290
Trust me.

26:55.290 --> 27:03.990
>> I can tell you they going to
put Audrey up.

27:03.990 --> 27:07.990
>> For sure.

27:07.990 --> 27:08.990
John won the veto.

27:08.990 --> 27:10.990
Obviously, he's going to take
himself off the block.

27:10.990 --> 27:12.990
I don't want to go you on the
block but I really don't want

27:12.990 --> 27:15.990
any of my close allies to go up
on the block either.

27:15.990 --> 27:18.990
So I need to talk to Shelli and
see where her head's at and see

27:18.990 --> 27:22.990
if I need to make any moves.

27:22.990 --> 27:24.990
>> But we're going to try to
make him not because I just

27:24.990 --> 27:29.990
talked to Becky and Becky's
totally cool with us keeping the

27:29.990 --> 27:33.990
no nations the same --
nominations the same, we go

27:33.990 --> 27:36.950
ahead and get da' out this
week and then the whole house

27:36.950 --> 27:39.000
will be -- Audrey will still be
the target --

27:39.000 --> 27:39.990
>> okay.

27:39.990 --> 27:41.000
So that's great plan if it
works.

27:41.000 --> 27:41.990
>> I know.

27:41.990 --> 27:46.410
F you can't convince him not
to use it, you need a backup

27:46.410 --> 27:46.990
plan.

27:46.990 --> 27:51.990
Any guy could be spun the wrong
way.

27:51.990 --> 27:52.990
It would have to be a woman.

27:52.990 --> 27:55.990
You have Jack.

27:55.990 --> 27:59.290
>> Nom at going to do Jackie
because she went through it last

27:59.290 --> 27:59.990
week.

27:59.990 --> 28:03.990
I'm not going to do Becky
because she won head of

28:03.990 --> 28:03.990
household.

28:03.990 --> 28:04.000
>> Meg.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.990
It needs to be an innocuous
person.

28:06.990 --> 28:08.990
>> All right.

28:08.990 --> 28:14.990
(Laughter)
>> Got it.

28:14.990 --> 28:16.950
I know.

28:16.950 --> 28:16.990
Ridiculous.

28:16.990 --> 28:22.120
We just talked to Becky, and
Becky is cool with not

28:22.120 --> 28:23.990
back-dooring Audrey right now
and getting day out.

28:23.990 --> 28:27.990
So what we need to talk to you
about is not using the power of

28:27.990 --> 28:29.990
veto.

28:29.990 --> 28:32.990
Everyone's gunning for da',
because no one is going to vote

28:32.990 --> 28:34.990
you out.

28:34.990 --> 28:36.990
>> I know we've asked you to do
a lot.

28:36.990 --> 28:40.540
If you feel uncomfortable at
all, we understand.

28:40.540 --> 28:43.990
However, I want you to know if
you decide not to use the power

28:43.990 --> 28:47.990
of veto, things will go more
smoothly, and we -- we guarantee

28:47.990 --> 28:49.990
to have the shot votes.

28:49.990 --> 28:50.830
We have the votes.

28:50.830 --> 28:52.990
We can list them right now for
you they're all with us.

28:52.990 --> 28:52.990
>> Uh-huh.

28:52.990 --> 28:56.830
And I would not ask you to do
this if we did not have the

28:56.830 --> 28:56.990
votes.

28:56.990 --> 28:59.990
>> Clay's talking to me like,
Johnny Mac, what I'm going to

28:59.990 --> 29:04.990
need you to do now, I know it's
putting a lot on you, but you

29:04.990 --> 29:05.990
can't use that veto.

29:05.990 --> 29:06.990
You got to sit on the block.

29:06.990 --> 29:08.990
I'm like, dude!

29:08.990 --> 29:11.990
>> But, again, if you're not
comfortable, Johnny, like, just

29:11.990 --> 29:12.990
say no.

29:12.990 --> 29:14.410
>> No!

29:14.410 --> 29:17.540
This is where, like, you got
to trust me if you decide to do

29:17.540 --> 29:17.990
this.

29:17.990 --> 29:19.700
>> Why would I do that?!

29:19.700 --> 29:19.990
Your option.

29:19.990 --> 29:20.990
It's up to you.

29:20.990 --> 29:22.990
We're not making you do
anything.

29:22.990 --> 29:24.290
We're not going to force you to.

29:24.290 --> 29:25.990
>> I'm not staying on the block
for you.

29:25.990 --> 29:26.990
>> Because everyone loves you.

29:26.990 --> 29:30.990
Clay you might use that in
the saloons in Texas to pick you

29:30.990 --> 29:33.990
the ladies but it's not going to
work on me, man.

29:33.990 --> 29:35.990
>> If you don't use it, they're
going to be like, they're all

29:35.990 --> 29:36.990
working together.

29:36.990 --> 29:39.990
That would destroy everything.

29:39.990 --> 29:40.990
>> You have to figure out the
rest of it on your own because

29:40.990 --> 29:42.990
this guy is safe for the week.

29:42.990 --> 29:46.290
>> Then talk to us about who you
think should go up.

29:46.290 --> 29:48.990
>> I don't care.

29:48.990 --> 29:50.120
They'll all stay.

29:50.120 --> 29:51.990
Becky, Liz.

29:51.990 --> 30:00.990
>> I'm not going to put Becky.

30:10.990 --> 30:11.990
Hey.

30:11.990 --> 30:13.000
Just want to talk to you real
quick.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.120
>> Yeah.

30:15.120 --> 30:18.990
Can you go get Liz real quick
actually?

30:18.990 --> 30:20.990
>> Yeah.

30:20.990 --> 30:21.990
Liz.

30:21.990 --> 30:22.990
She wants to talk to you.

30:22.990 --> 30:27.540
>> Now that John's won pov, I'm
going to have to come up with a

30:27.540 --> 30:27.990
replacement nominee.

30:27.990 --> 30:30.990
I have to many could up, ath
pawn, someone who is going to

30:30.990 --> 30:33.990
ultimately ensure that
Da'vonne goes home this week.

30:33.990 --> 30:34.700
Maybe Liz.

30:34.700 --> 30:37.990
Liz isn't really aligned with
anyone strongly in this house.

30:37.990 --> 30:40.990
She might be a safe bet to put
up there.

30:40.990 --> 30:44.990
So here's the thing.

30:44.990 --> 30:48.990
The original plan was da' out
this week, Audrey out next week.

30:48.990 --> 30:49.290
>> Right.

30:49.290 --> 30:50.990
Still the plan.

30:50.990 --> 30:55.990
Obviously, the original plan was
that Johnny Mac not winning the

30:55.990 --> 30:58.990
veto, anybody else winning the
veto, we would have kept the

30:58.990 --> 30:59.990
nominations the same.

30:59.990 --> 30:59.990
>> I know.

30:59.990 --> 31:02.950
So I have to put somebody
else up.

31:02.950 --> 31:02.990
>> Yeah.

31:02.990 --> 31:05.950
I'm thinking about -- and I
have to talk to you about

31:05.950 --> 31:10.990
putting you up in place of John.

31:10.990 --> 31:11.990
>> Okay.

31:11.990 --> 31:16.120
And listen, I want you to
know this is so frickin' tough

31:16.120 --> 31:18.700
because this is not what I
wanted to do --

31:18.700 --> 31:18.990
>> yeah.

31:18.990 --> 31:19.990
-- At all.

31:19.990 --> 31:20.990
I'm so scared.

31:20.990 --> 31:21.990
Know.

31:21.990 --> 31:23.990
'M just like nervous because
all these -- I don't have the

31:23.990 --> 31:25.990
numbers like she had or has.

31:25.990 --> 31:26.990
>> Don't tell anybody that you
know.

31:26.990 --> 31:27.990
>> Okay.

31:27.990 --> 31:27.990
?

31:27.990 --> 31:30.990
Because if you start telling
people, everyone's going to

31:30.990 --> 31:31.990
start talking about it.

31:31.990 --> 31:32.990
Everyone's going to know the
plan.

31:32.990 --> 31:36.990
And it's going to blow up and
da' will then know who to

31:36.990 --> 31:37.990
campaign against.

31:37.990 --> 31:37.990
>> Against, I know.

31:37.990 --> 31:40.990
If she finds out it's you,
she will gun for and you find a

31:40.990 --> 31:42.410
way to get you out.

31:42.410 --> 31:43.950
>> I'm completely blindsided.

31:43.950 --> 31:46.990
I'll really shocked that I would
be the one she would choose.

31:46.990 --> 31:52.990
I'm just nodding my head, but
inside, I am just freaking out.

31:52.990 --> 31:52.990
I'm scared.

31:52.990 --> 31:57.990
>> I know, honey.

31:57.990 --> 31:57.990
Okay.

31:57.990 --> 31:58.950
All right.

31:58.950 --> 32:00.990
I'll take one for the team.

32:00.990 --> 32:02.990
All right.

32:07.990 --> 32:10.990
Dude, I'm scared.

32:10.990 --> 32:13.950
Shelli's like I need a pawn to
go up on the block.

32:13.950 --> 32:15.990
I'm going to put up you.

32:15.990 --> 32:19.990
I can't trust anyone.

32:19.990 --> 32:23.990
>> Right now I wouldn't make too
many rash moves because you will

32:23.990 --> 32:25.830
set da' off before it's
officially happened.

32:25.830 --> 32:27.700
So take a nap.

32:27.700 --> 32:27.990
Stay calm.

32:27.990 --> 32:32.950
You know the people that like me
and Austin that are on your side

32:32.950 --> 32:34.990
because we like you.

32:34.990 --> 32:36.990
>> I'm not going to go down
without a fight.

32:36.990 --> 32:38.990
>> I don't think you're
threatening anyone in the house.

32:38.990 --> 32:39.990
>> No.

32:39.990 --> 32:40.990
I know.

32:40.990 --> 32:42.990
Like --
>> the thing about da', people

32:42.990 --> 32:45.000
know she's not a straight
shooter and that's already

32:45.000 --> 32:47.990
concerning people because they
know they can't work with her.

32:47.990 --> 32:47.990
Right?

32:47.990 --> 32:49.990
So da's got her hands in so
many --

32:49.990 --> 32:50.990
>> I know.

32:50.990 --> 32:52.990
And she's a firecracker.

32:52.990 --> 32:52.990
Yeah.

32:52.990 --> 32:56.290
I need to make sure that Liz
does not go on the block.

32:56.290 --> 32:57.990
I can't lose her this week.

32:57.990 --> 32:58.990
She's my friend.

32:58.990 --> 32:59.120
She's my Ally.

32:59.120 --> 33:02.990
I have complete faith in her
word, and I know she trusts me.

33:02.990 --> 33:04.990
And that's really hard to find
in this game.

33:04.990 --> 33:06.990
>> She will show her hand.

33:06.990 --> 33:08.990
She's going to dig her own
grave.

33:08.990 --> 33:09.990
She already has.

33:09.990 --> 33:11.700
>> Yeah.

33:11.700 --> 33:12.990
I don't want you to go.

33:12.990 --> 33:13.990
Don't worry.

33:13.990 --> 33:15.120
>> We have to keep this a
secret.

33:15.120 --> 33:20.990
>> Quiet.

33:20.990 --> 33:23.950
All I'm thinking about is my
twin sister Julia.

33:23.950 --> 33:25.000
I'm not only playing this by
myself.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.990
I'm playing it with her.

33:26.990 --> 33:29.990
We could be going home in week
two.

33:29.990 --> 33:32.990
I, of course, helped to work my
way out of this mess.

33:32.990 --> 33:34.990
>> I'm going to pretend that I'm
not.

33:41.990 --> 33:42.990
>> Julie: Be a fly on the wall
inside the "Big Brother" house.

33:42.990 --> 34:02.990
Watch the houseguests anytime
with the live feed on CBS.Com.

34:02.990 --> 34:03.990
>> Hi.

34:03.990 --> 34:04.990
Welcome to the party.

34:04.990 --> 34:05.990
Yeah, sure.

34:05.990 --> 34:10.990
Scoot over.

34:10.990 --> 34:15.990
(Laughter)
>> She's petrified.

34:15.990 --> 34:15.990
(Laughter).

34:15.990 --> 34:16.990
>> Oh, my God.

34:16.990 --> 34:17.990
I miss boys.

34:17.990 --> 34:18.990
>> What?

34:18.990 --> 34:19.990
You got us right here.

34:19.990 --> 34:24.990
(Laughter)
>> So I hear all this hootin'

34:24.990 --> 34:27.990
and hollers at 5:00 A.M. in the
morning when I'm trying to

34:27.990 --> 34:27.990
sleep.

34:27.990 --> 34:30.990
And I start thinking, maybe I
could plant a seed, maybe smear

34:30.990 --> 34:33.990
the truth a little bit and see
if I can get Meg to get on the

34:33.990 --> 34:35.990
block instead of Liz.

34:35.990 --> 34:44.990
(Laughter)
>> No.

34:44.990 --> 34:49.990
I need to get Vanessa on
board that we can both go talk

34:49.990 --> 34:50.990
to Shelli.

34:50.990 --> 34:53.990
If Vanessa and I both go up
there, Shelli just might buy

34:53.990 --> 34:57.990
this lie of mine.

34:57.990 --> 35:00.990
>> At night I can hear them
through our walls and that whole

35:00.990 --> 35:05.950
group, they're talking about
flipping on Clay and Shelli and

35:05.950 --> 35:10.000
so they start whispering about,
like, they're all together, they

35:10.000 --> 35:12.990
might save da' unless you put
Meg up.

35:12.990 --> 35:14.990
She needs to know that.

35:14.990 --> 35:15.990
>> Tell her.

35:15.990 --> 35:33.990
You do, though, not me
because we can't lose Liz.

35:33.990 --> 35:35.990
>> Austin
could hear da' trying

35:35.990 --> 35:40.540
to get them to rally to keep her
to go after you.

35:40.540 --> 35:44.990
And Clay.

35:44.990 --> 35:53.990
Someone like Meg, James, Jason.

35:53.990 --> 35:54.990
>> Hey.

35:54.990 --> 35:57.990
What's up?

35:57.990 --> 35:58.990
E're sharing info.

35:58.990 --> 35:59.990
Oh, yeah?

35:59.990 --> 36:01.990
So what did everybody say
last night?

36:01.990 --> 36:05.990
>> I feel like they're setting
uys up isolatelated and separate

36:05.990 --> 36:06.990
right now.

36:06.990 --> 36:09.990
At least day as trying to do
that.

36:09.990 --> 36:11.990
Like, we got to band together.

36:11.990 --> 36:13.990
We got to make sure this is
solid.

36:13.990 --> 36:14.290
I don't know.

36:14.290 --> 36:18.950
>> Did it sound like people
telling da' that.

36:18.950 --> 36:20.990
>> Between the walls she's
whispering so I'm trying to

36:20.990 --> 36:20.990
hear.

36:20.990 --> 36:23.410
So it's just concerning to me.

36:23.410 --> 36:24.990
>> They were having that
conversation right there

36:24.990 --> 36:25.990
>> yeah.

36:25.990 --> 36:27.990
That's what I'm saying.

36:27.990 --> 36:31.540
I'm concerned for you because,
like, they're seeing you guys as

36:31.540 --> 36:31.990
a duo.

36:31.990 --> 36:35.990
I'm just worried that somehow
they have seven people down

36:35.990 --> 36:38.990
there, can flip this thing and
keep her in there.

36:38.990 --> 36:40.990
Unless Meg was up.

36:40.990 --> 36:43.950
Because if Meg was up, there's
no way Meg goes home.

36:43.950 --> 36:45.990
Zero.

36:45.990 --> 36:48.990
>> Austin has brought up a very
good point to me.

36:48.990 --> 36:53.990
If I put up a pawn like Liz on
the block next to da', da' has

36:53.990 --> 36:55.990
every chance to stay here and
come gunning after me.

36:55.990 --> 36:59.990
But no one's going to vote out
sweet Meg.

36:59.990 --> 37:03.000
If I put Meg up, they have to
choose between one of theirs.

37:03.000 --> 37:12.990
>> Sometimes it's good be a
little paranoid.

37:12.990 --> 37:14.990
>> I'm kind of excited that I
have my own bed.

37:14.990 --> 37:17.990
It's one of the blessings of
being one of the most hated

37:17.990 --> 37:18.990
persons in the house.

37:18.990 --> 37:20.990
>> You can't argue that you
brought some of this stuff on

37:20.990 --> 37:21.990
yourself.

37:21.990 --> 37:24.990
>> So can we have middle school
talk?

37:24.990 --> 37:25.990
>> What?

37:25.990 --> 37:28.120
O do you want to get out?

37:28.120 --> 37:39.990
I would recommend -- I feel like
I'm the target.

37:39.990 --> 37:40.990
>> You're staying.

37:40.990 --> 37:43.990
Not me and Shelli.

37:43.990 --> 37:46.990
>> It feels like you're telling
me basically stay in this house,

37:46.990 --> 37:47.990
do what we want.

37:47.990 --> 37:49.990
>> I didn't say any of that,
Audrey.

37:49.990 --> 37:54.290
Don't go and put words in my
mouth.

37:54.290 --> 37:56.990
I know exactly what I said.

37:56.990 --> 37:59.120
>> I don't know if you're like
aware of this, but it sounds

37:59.120 --> 38:02.950
like you're being condescending
a little bit.

38:02.950 --> 38:04.000
>> I don't really see that at
all but --

38:04.000 --> 38:06.990
>> it feels that way.

38:06.990 --> 38:10.990
Like, it just feels that way
when you're like, well, just so

38:10.990 --> 38:17.950
you know, da, da, da, ta, da,
da.

38:17.950 --> 38:19.830
>> So --
like I've been completely

38:19.830 --> 38:20.830
aban dond.

38:20.830 --> 38:29.990
>> I don't know what you expect.

38:29.990 --> 38:31.990
If --
>> are you kidding me?

38:31.990 --> 38:36.990
The whole house wants you
out, Audrey.

38:36.990 --> 38:38.990
>> You know, this is typical
Audrey, just kind of doing her

38:38.990 --> 38:40.990
thing, trying to put words in
people's mouths.

38:40.990 --> 38:43.990
I can't trust her as far as I
can throw her.

38:43.990 --> 38:44.990
I don't believe anything she
says.

38:44.990 --> 38:47.990
If it wasn't for me and Shelli,
she would be back-doored this

38:47.990 --> 38:56.950
week.

38:56.950 --> 38:58.990
>> You and I need to have a talk
about Audrey.

38:58.990 --> 38:58.990
>> Yeah?

38:58.990 --> 39:01.990
I'm not saying she's a bad
person but in this game she

39:01.990 --> 39:03.410
makes me nervous.

39:03.410 --> 39:05.950
I don't trust her at all.

39:05.950 --> 39:09.120
>> This is actually pretty good.

39:09.120 --> 39:14.990
Having chose an replacement
nominee and I'm getting

39:14.990 --> 39:16.990
pressure.

39:49.990 --> 39:51.700
>> So obviously, I already know
John is going to use the power

39:51.700 --> 39:52.990
of veto to save himself.

39:52.990 --> 39:55.990
I'm hoping that Shelli puts
Audrey on the block next to me

39:55.990 --> 39:58.990
because that would be the best
way for me to stay in this

39:58.990 --> 40:03.990
house.

40:03.990 --> 40:07.000
>> I've been reassured a million
times what is going to go down.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.990
Of course, there's always that
little voice in your head that

40:09.990 --> 40:12.830
makes you second-guess
everything.

40:12.830 --> 40:16.990
Either way, I just want to get
this over with and get to

40:16.990 --> 40:22.410
movin'.

40:22.410 --> 40:22.990
>> Hey, everyone.

40:22.990 --> 40:30.410
It's time for the veto meeting.

40:36.990 --> 40:39.990
This is the veto meeting.

40:39.990 --> 40:41.990
Da'vonne and I
have been nominated for

40:41.990 --> 40:44.990
eviction.

40:44.990 --> 40:50.290
But I have the power to veto one
of those nominations.

40:50.290 --> 40:57.290
I have decided to
use the power of veto

40:57.290 --> 41:00.990
to save myself.

41:00.990 --> 41:04.950
Shelli, you will have to choose
a new house guest as a

41:04.950 --> 41:05.990
replacement untilny.

41:05.990 --> 41:09.990
-- Nominee.

41:09.990 --> 41:14.540
>> This is not a tradition that
is fun for anybody to be in.

41:14.540 --> 41:16.990
I have formed a love for each
and every one of you.

41:16.990 --> 41:18.990
Da'vonne, I think you're a
beautiful, fantastic woman, and

41:18.990 --> 41:21.950
I loved getting to know you and
I'm so happy that we've met.

41:21.950 --> 41:25.990
And I'm so sorry that we do have
to play a game.

41:25.990 --> 41:29.990
So I do have to choose a
replacement nominee, and so,

41:29.990 --> 41:40.990
Meg, if you could please get up
there next to Da'vonne.

41:40.990 --> 41:42.990
>> This veto meet something
adjourned.

41:42.990 --> 41:52.950
-- Meeting is adjourned.

41:52.950 --> 41:54.290
>> I knew there was going to be
a pawn.

41:54.290 --> 41:56.830
I was really hoping it wasn't
going to be me.

41:56.830 --> 42:04.990
But here I am.

42:04.990 --> 42:08.410
The best situation is I'm put up
as a pawn so da' has no fighting

42:08.410 --> 42:08.990
chance.

42:08.990 --> 42:09.990
>> Da'vonne is still on the
block now.

42:09.990 --> 42:12.990
That means that my ultimate plan
from the beginning is going to

42:12.990 --> 42:13.950
follow through.

42:13.950 --> 42:17.990
Nobody's going to vote out our
sweet Meg.

42:17.990 --> 42:20.700
So Meg is sitting next to me on
the block.

42:20.700 --> 42:23.000
Meg is definitely a pawn.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.990
People love Meg.

42:24.990 --> 42:27.990
But if you're bettin' against
me, you're crazy.

42:27.990 --> 42:31.990
You should always be team da'
because we're going to ride

42:31.990 --> 42:34.120
these things until the wheels
fall off and I don't see them

42:34.120 --> 42:35.990
breaking off no time soon.

42:35.990 --> 42:37.990
>> It sucks my girl Da'vonne
is on the block.

42:37.990 --> 42:41.990
But we don't know what this last
twist is or what this twist

42:41.990 --> 42:42.120
means.

42:42.120 --> 42:46.990
But hopefully it's going to work
out for us.

42:46.990 --> 42:48.990
>> Announcer: Who will be
evicted from the "Big Brother"

42:48.990 --> 42:48.990
house?

42:48.990 --> 42:50.120
Da'vonne or Meg?

42:50.120 --> 42:54.990
And who will receive the power
of the last laugh?

42:54.990 --> 42:57.990
Plus -- two more heads of
household will be crowned.

42:57.990 --> 43:03.290
It all happens live tomorrow at
9:00/8:00 central on "big

43:03.290 --> 43:06.990
brother"!
