WEBVTT

00:10.097 --> 00:13.752
Uh. Sam, do you mind
asking Jay to move to the couch?

00:13.883 --> 00:16.407
Okay. Why?

00:16.538 --> 00:19.454
- What?
- Sass just came in and he
wants you to move seats?

00:19.584 --> 00:21.934
Well, for about six minutes
every afternoon, that chair

00:22.065 --> 00:23.675
is bathed in a
shaft of light

00:23.806 --> 00:26.896
and it feels really nice.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.506
We don't have
a lot going on, Sam.

00:28.637 --> 00:30.726
He likes the shaft of light.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.207
Sure, buddy. Go for it.

00:33.337 --> 00:34.469
Yes!

00:36.558 --> 00:39.256
Oh.

00:39.387 --> 00:41.432
Oh, crap...

00:41.563 --> 00:43.086
Too late. I got the shaft.

00:43.217 --> 00:45.871
Damn it.
I snooze-eth and lose-eth.

00:46.002 --> 00:49.397
Sass, I'll give you
ten back rubs for the seat.

00:49.527 --> 00:50.702
I'll make it 20.

00:50.833 --> 00:52.269
That's a pretty generous offer.

00:52.400 --> 00:55.011
100 back rubs!

00:55.142 --> 00:56.273
You got yourself a deal.

00:57.753 --> 01:00.234
I'm sorry, what is
going on? Back rubs?

01:00.364 --> 01:01.278
You don't know
about the back rubs?

01:01.409 --> 01:03.237
How does she not know
about the back rubs?

01:03.367 --> 01:05.369
Honestly, I try to shut a
lot of this ghost stuff out.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.241
You don't deserve
this power.

01:07.371 --> 01:09.460
Back rubs are like
our ghost currency.

01:09.591 --> 01:11.767
We can't handle money,
so centuries ago

01:11.897 --> 01:13.508
we decided on back rubs.

01:13.638 --> 01:15.510
The problem is, no one
can compete with Hetty.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.033
Through a combination

01:17.164 --> 01:18.948
of shrewd bargaining
and a general disdain

01:19.079 --> 01:20.428
for physical touch...

01:20.558 --> 01:21.907
Hmm....which leads her

01:22.038 --> 01:23.300
to never cash them in,

01:23.431 --> 01:26.260
Hetty has amassed a vast
wealth of back rubs.

01:26.390 --> 01:28.218
It's not fair. Hetty's
constantly outbidding me.

01:28.349 --> 01:29.306
I've only been
dead for 20 years.

01:29.437 --> 01:30.829
I don't have the capital.

01:30.960 --> 01:33.223
Well, Trevor,
that's just how the world works.

01:33.354 --> 01:35.747
You're new money and
you always will be.

01:35.878 --> 01:36.879
In the meantime,

01:37.009 --> 01:39.360
it is I who gets the shaft.

01:39.490 --> 01:43.320
And, let me tell you,
it feels so good.

01:49.935 --> 01:54.026
And here's your change, $1.50.

01:54.157 --> 01:55.419
Enjoy your blender.

01:55.550 --> 01:57.334
No returns.

01:57.465 --> 02:00.468
Hey, man, could you go
a little lower on this lamp?

02:00.598 --> 02:04.167
Wish we could, but we didn't
get rich by giving things away.

02:04.298 --> 02:07.257
No, you got rich by inheriting
all my money when I died.

02:07.388 --> 02:09.738
Henry, I think we have
a live one in cookware.

02:11.174 --> 02:12.784
Hey, that's my Jell-O mold.

02:12.915 --> 02:15.091
Put that down.
That is a family heirloom!

02:15.222 --> 02:16.658
Hey, Jay, do you see

02:16.788 --> 02:18.138
that guy over there?
He's dressed

02:18.268 --> 02:19.530
like one
of your Ren fair buddies.

02:19.661 --> 02:22.011
The only thing I see
is a cheapskate

02:22.142 --> 02:23.447
with a mustache
and a fanny pack.

02:23.578 --> 02:25.841
Oh, my God,
he's a Viking ghost.

02:25.971 --> 02:27.364
Thor's gonna have
so many questions.

02:27.495 --> 02:29.105
I have to go talk to him.

02:29.236 --> 02:31.586
Excuse me. May I use
your restroom, please?

02:31.716 --> 02:34.632
I'm sorry,
it's for paying customers only.

02:34.763 --> 02:37.592
Okay, uh, Jay,
just buy the lamp.

02:38.636 --> 02:41.073
Thank you for undermining
my bargaining power, babe.

02:44.686 --> 02:46.296
Hmm.

02:46.427 --> 02:49.778
That's kinda cool.
Sam loves fruit art.

02:49.908 --> 02:51.258
Why is it upside down?

02:51.388 --> 02:53.999
It's because
they're swingers.

02:54.130 --> 02:56.263
That's right.
My son's a pervert.

02:56.393 --> 02:58.656
Oh, hey, man, uh...

02:58.787 --> 03:00.397
This is a pretty cool
upside down pineapple.

03:00.528 --> 03:02.704
Oh, are you into that?

03:02.834 --> 03:04.096
Sicko!

03:04.227 --> 03:08.579
A little, but honestly,
Sam really loves it.

03:08.710 --> 03:12.061
Really? Well,
isn't she full of surprises?

03:12.192 --> 03:13.671
She learned about it in college.

03:13.802 --> 03:15.282
I'll bet.

03:15.412 --> 03:17.066
Where did I go wrong?

03:20.287 --> 03:22.376
<i>And now the chair
is cold. Damn it.</i>

03:22.506 --> 03:24.856
People don't understand
how nice a warm chair is

03:24.987 --> 03:26.031
when you don't
have pants on.

03:26.162 --> 03:27.555
- You okay, buddy?
- Pete,

03:27.685 --> 03:28.643
it's not fair how much richer

03:28.773 --> 03:30.210
Hetty is than the rest of us.

03:30.340 --> 03:32.081
Yeah, she throws around
her back rub wealth,

03:32.212 --> 03:33.604
but what are you gonna do
about it?

03:33.735 --> 03:35.519
I don't know,
but we should do something.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.782
She sits here
lording it over us.

03:37.913 --> 03:39.654
She's like those two old
rich guys from <i>Trading Places.</i>

03:39.784 --> 03:42.657
Oh, great flick.
Oh! Maybe I should choose it

03:42.787 --> 03:44.224
this week, when it's my turn
to pick TV time.

03:46.356 --> 03:47.444
That's it.

03:48.837 --> 03:49.707
TV time.

03:49.838 --> 03:50.839
What-- What about it?

03:50.969 --> 03:52.536
That's how I take Hetty down.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.146
Yes, she's been around
a long time,

03:54.277 --> 03:55.974
but I was
a Wall Street whiz kid.

03:56.105 --> 03:58.934
And you just gave me an idea
for a new financial instrument.

03:59.064 --> 04:00.675
It's simple as long as you
understand the basic principles

04:00.805 --> 04:03.765
of market power and the downward
sloping demand curve.

04:03.895 --> 04:05.767
Okay.

04:05.897 --> 04:08.857
Well, I'm out. But have fun.

04:10.685 --> 04:12.295
<i>Hey, big fella,</i>

04:12.426 --> 04:13.905
it's okay.
I'm a friend.

04:14.036 --> 04:16.125
In Odin's name,
how can you see me?

04:16.256 --> 04:17.605
I fell down some stairs

04:17.735 --> 04:18.780
and was technically dead
for three minutes--

04:18.910 --> 04:20.738
it's a whole thing--
but who are you?

04:20.869 --> 04:23.741
I'm Bjorn.

04:23.872 --> 04:26.440
I'm from the land of Norvegr.

04:26.570 --> 04:29.530
I died on this property
many, many moons ago.

04:29.660 --> 04:32.010
Okay. Uh, well,
this is kind of a long shot,

04:32.141 --> 04:35.623
but I live nearby and I know
another Viking ghost, Thorfinn.

04:35.753 --> 04:37.407
Big man. Beard.

04:37.538 --> 04:38.365
Yes, exactly.

04:38.495 --> 04:39.844
Abandoned by his shipmates.

04:39.975 --> 04:41.585
Yes! Do you know him?

04:41.716 --> 04:44.414
It is he who I came looking for.

04:44.545 --> 04:47.852
You see, I am...

04:47.983 --> 04:49.550
his son.

04:56.731 --> 04:57.949
What is it?
What must you tell Thor?

04:58.080 --> 05:00.517
Okay. Well, like I
said, it's big news.

05:00.648 --> 05:02.040
I'm talking
earth-shattering.

05:02.171 --> 05:03.477
Well, he might want
to sit down for this.

05:03.607 --> 05:05.130
- I-Is he sitting down?
- Yes, Jay.

05:05.261 --> 05:06.784
How do they sit on furniture?

05:06.915 --> 05:08.177
Wouldn't they just
go through it?

05:08.308 --> 05:10.875
You said they just go
through walls, right?

05:11.006 --> 05:13.965
Whoa, this is gonna spin me
out for the whole afternoon.

05:14.096 --> 05:16.925
By the loins of Freya,
tell Thor the news!

05:17.055 --> 05:18.970
Okay, Thor. So, I went
over to the Farnsbys'

05:19.101 --> 05:23.061
and I met a ghost.
He was a Viking ghost.

05:23.192 --> 05:25.020
He was your son Bjorn.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.588
How do you know this name?

05:27.718 --> 05:29.329
I just told you I met him.

05:29.459 --> 05:32.070
Is impossible.

05:32.201 --> 05:34.290
You're saying that my son,
who I haven't seen

05:34.421 --> 05:37.075
in a thousand years,
has been two ship lengths away

05:37.206 --> 05:38.599
this entire time.

05:38.729 --> 05:40.165
I know, it's so crazy,

05:40.296 --> 05:42.559
but it's true. I would
never lie about this.

05:45.432 --> 05:47.695
You met my baby Bjorn?

05:47.825 --> 05:50.001
Well, he's all
grown up now.

05:50.132 --> 05:54.049
Last I saw him,
he was just a...

05:54.179 --> 05:55.180
...little boy.

05:55.311 --> 05:57.531
Bjorn, when I
was your age,

05:57.661 --> 06:01.622
my father gave me this.

06:06.714 --> 06:09.412
And now I give it to you.

06:10.587 --> 06:12.023
May you spill the blood

06:12.154 --> 06:13.634
of many Danes with it.

06:15.418 --> 06:19.466
Now say, "Goodbye, Father."

06:22.556 --> 06:25.167
Come on. You can do it.

06:25.297 --> 06:27.822
Say "Father."

06:27.952 --> 06:29.954
He's still too young to speak,
you know this.

06:35.743 --> 06:38.006
Then I shall hear it
upon my return.

06:39.964 --> 06:42.271
But I never do hear him say
"Father"

06:42.402 --> 06:44.012
because I never return.

06:44.142 --> 06:46.710
Well, he came
looking for you, Thor.

06:46.841 --> 06:49.931
All the way
from the Old World.

06:50.061 --> 06:51.976
What if a wall were
made out of couch?

06:52.107 --> 06:53.717
Would I not be able
to go through that?

06:53.848 --> 06:56.503
Thor want to know everything.
Have so many questions.

06:56.633 --> 06:57.852
I thought you might,
which is why

06:57.982 --> 06:59.854
I asked a lot
of questions.

06:59.984 --> 07:03.858
Okay, so, Bjorn was married.
He had three kids.

07:03.988 --> 07:05.860
You're a gramps, buddy!

07:05.990 --> 07:07.165
Who was his first kill?

07:07.296 --> 07:09.472
His first kill?

07:09.603 --> 07:10.865
I don't think we covered that.

07:10.995 --> 07:12.867
Okay...

07:12.997 --> 07:14.259
How many Danish heads
did he have lined up

07:14.390 --> 07:15.739
outside his cottage?

07:15.870 --> 07:19.221
Again, I didn't
ask that, specifically.

07:19.351 --> 07:22.093
You call yourself journalist?
These are obvious questions.

07:22.224 --> 07:23.791
Oh, yeah, he's got you there,
Sam. Who, what, where,

07:23.921 --> 07:26.141
when, why,
how many severed heads?

07:26.271 --> 07:27.751
These are the tools
of your trade.

07:27.882 --> 07:29.231
Thor wish he could speak
to Bjorn himself.

07:29.361 --> 07:31.842
He's so close yet so far.

07:31.973 --> 07:33.496
I know. It's too bad
that you don't live

07:33.627 --> 07:35.542
next door to your son
and then you could just, like,

07:35.672 --> 07:37.631
walk up to the property
line and talk to him.

07:37.761 --> 07:39.241
But the Farnsbys'
is two doors over.

07:39.371 --> 07:41.199
Wait a minute.

07:41.330 --> 07:44.594
There may be a way
for them to speak. Follow me.

07:51.383 --> 07:52.036
Huh.

07:52.167 --> 07:53.777
Need help?

07:53.908 --> 07:56.388
Alberta, I know
it's your turn to choose,

07:56.519 --> 07:59.870
but I'll pay you 50 back rubs
to watch <i>Bodices & Barons.</i>

08:00.001 --> 08:01.002
Ugh, is that that boring
period piece drama?

08:01.132 --> 08:02.743
Boring?

08:02.873 --> 08:05.093
Did you not see the
smoldering glances

08:05.223 --> 08:07.095
the baron shot at the
chambermaid last week?

08:07.225 --> 08:09.010
Shocked they can put
that on the television.

08:09.140 --> 08:10.968
Well, as exciting
as that sounds,

08:11.099 --> 08:12.709
I already sold
all my TV time

08:12.840 --> 08:13.971
for the next month
to Trevor.

08:14.102 --> 08:17.366
Oh, you did?
So did I.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.108
I also sold Trevor my TV time.
It was part of some

08:20.238 --> 08:22.110
elaborate plan of his
I didn't understand.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.460
The plan's actually
quite simple.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.941
I bought everyone's TV time.

08:27.071 --> 08:30.031
And now I have a monopoly
for the next month.

08:30.161 --> 08:32.686
And I'm gonna use it
to watch classic '90s

08:32.816 --> 08:36.428
figure skating rom-com
<i>The Cutting Edge</i> on repeat.

08:38.387 --> 08:39.954
Relax, relax.
All you have to do is

08:40.084 --> 08:42.652
buy your TV time back from me...

08:42.783 --> 08:44.698
at a huge markup, of course.

08:44.828 --> 08:47.527
Trevor, why are
you doing this?

08:47.657 --> 08:49.616
To level the playing field.

08:49.746 --> 08:51.879
After this, I'm going
to have so many back rubs,

08:52.009 --> 08:54.185
it's gonna be like
Burke Williams in here.

08:54.316 --> 08:56.492
- What is that?
- Who's Burke Williams?

08:56.623 --> 08:57.624
- Is that a bank?
- You may not understand
that reference,

08:57.754 --> 08:59.669
but trust me, it is apt.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.628
<i>Hey, babe, check it out.</i>

09:02.890 --> 09:04.500
See? Look. You can
see the Farnsbys'

09:04.631 --> 09:06.502
top floor from
this window.

09:06.633 --> 09:09.026
I noticed it recently after
Sass's tree got cut down.

09:09.157 --> 09:11.812
- Sorry about that, Sass.
- Oh, he's not here.

09:11.942 --> 09:13.901
Oh, okay, well, then,
I am feeling...

09:14.031 --> 09:15.903
- Hetty?
- Let's not do this.

09:16.033 --> 09:18.427
So... how will Thor
speak to Bjorn?

09:18.558 --> 09:19.863
Well, if you stand here,

09:19.994 --> 09:21.952
then I will get Bjorn
to stand by that window,

09:22.083 --> 09:23.388
then you two could
yell at each other.

09:23.519 --> 09:26.957
Yes! I can yell at my son
the way my father yell at me.

09:27.088 --> 09:28.916
Except it would be
out of love

09:29.046 --> 09:32.354
and not anger that I eat
all the ram's testicles.

09:32.484 --> 09:34.138
Okay. Be on this
spot in one hour.

09:34.269 --> 09:35.836
We just need to figure
out some excuse

09:35.966 --> 09:38.186
to get into the
Farnsbys' house.

09:38.316 --> 09:40.405
I'm sorry, did you say
"ram's testicles"?

09:40.536 --> 09:42.451
I don't even want to know.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.322
Is Norse delicacy.

09:44.453 --> 09:47.456
I wonder if Bjorn likes...
Did you ask him this?

09:47.587 --> 09:48.500
It didn't come up.

09:48.631 --> 09:51.112
Big surprise.

09:51.242 --> 09:53.680
<i>375 back rubs for Friday night.</i>

09:53.810 --> 09:56.421
400!
Sold to Alberta.

09:56.552 --> 09:57.597
Yes! Oh...

09:57.727 --> 09:59.076
It's a steep price,

09:59.207 --> 10:01.035
but at least
I'll get my Jason Momoa fix.

10:01.165 --> 10:03.864
And we will be watching
certain scenes in slo-mo.

10:03.994 --> 10:06.344
Aka slo-Momoa.

10:06.475 --> 10:09.260
Not my best work, but I had
to get it out of my head.

10:09.391 --> 10:12.437
What if, instead of
bidding against each other

10:12.568 --> 10:15.440
and driving up the price,
we form a coalition?

10:15.571 --> 10:17.355
Utilize the power
of collective bargaining?

10:17.486 --> 10:18.443
Oh, like we form a union.

10:18.574 --> 10:21.185
I did not use
the U-word.

10:21.316 --> 10:24.449
I am simply suggesting,
if we band together

10:24.580 --> 10:27.191
and agree not to buy any
TV time, it becomes valueless.

10:27.322 --> 10:28.366
And Trevor
will have nothing.

10:28.497 --> 10:30.107
Okay. So,

10:30.238 --> 10:30.891
what are we supposed to do,
just watch

10:31.021 --> 10:32.283
<i>The Cutting Edge</i> over and over?

10:32.414 --> 10:33.502
The guy loses his
peripheral vision

10:33.633 --> 10:34.721
and can't play hockey

10:34.851 --> 10:36.723
but he can still figure skate?

10:36.853 --> 10:38.028
Doesn't make any sense.

10:38.159 --> 10:39.073
Okay, maybe we don't watch TV

10:39.203 --> 10:40.465
at all.

10:40.596 --> 10:41.858
Like the good old days,
you know?

10:41.989 --> 10:44.818
Trivia, charades,
sharing secrets...

10:44.948 --> 10:46.384
I don't like mustard.

10:46.515 --> 10:49.561
You won't be able to
last without TV time.

10:49.692 --> 10:51.781
You'll be back.
You'll all be back.

10:51.912 --> 10:53.043
No, Trevor.

10:53.174 --> 10:54.479
Not if we stick together.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.525
Because together...

10:57.569 --> 11:00.094
...the power belongs
to the people.

11:00.224 --> 11:03.010
Oh, I hate myself.
I really hated saying that.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.533
How's Thor's hair?

11:04.664 --> 11:07.101
What about scar, hmm?

11:07.231 --> 11:08.580
Thor, he's not gonna
be able to make out

11:08.711 --> 11:11.105
those tiny details
from that distant window.

11:11.235 --> 11:12.541
But he also won't smell
the wolf urine,

11:12.672 --> 11:13.585
so it all evens out.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.762
Just so nervous and excited.

11:15.892 --> 11:18.199
Is biggest moment
of Thor's life.

11:18.329 --> 11:19.983
What are you gonna
yell about with him first?

11:20.114 --> 11:22.116
I don't know, just...

11:22.246 --> 11:25.249
So many questions, I...
know so little of him.

11:25.380 --> 11:27.382
Well, Samantha made some notes

11:27.512 --> 11:28.949
from the conversation.
Let's see here...

11:29.079 --> 11:31.212
He lived in...

11:31.342 --> 11:33.431
unpronounceable town
with far too many consonants

11:33.562 --> 11:35.303
with his wife, Alma.

11:36.826 --> 11:39.350
No, that wrong.
That name Danish. It...

11:39.481 --> 11:41.265
must be mistake.

11:41.396 --> 11:43.267
Oh, no, no, no.
No, that's what it says here.

11:43.398 --> 11:45.748
He had three children:
Magnus, Inger and Lars.

11:45.879 --> 11:50.187
But those also names of Danes.

11:51.362 --> 11:53.321
Oh, dear.

11:53.451 --> 11:55.410
Bjorn...

11:55.540 --> 11:56.585
married Dane.

11:58.761 --> 12:01.068
Is deepest betrayal.

12:02.678 --> 12:04.332
Bjorn is...

12:04.462 --> 12:06.116
traitor.

12:06.247 --> 12:08.031
Well, you know,
so was Benedict Arnold,

12:08.162 --> 12:10.033
but he was still
a delightful dinner party guest.

12:10.164 --> 12:12.427
Thor,
who cares who he married?

12:12.557 --> 12:13.558
Bjorn's your son.

12:13.689 --> 12:15.778
No.

12:15.909 --> 12:17.127
This is where you're wrong.

12:18.694 --> 12:21.915
Thor have no son!

12:22.829 --> 12:23.917
Well, this is gonna make

12:24.047 --> 12:25.266
- for an awkward reunion.
- Yeah...

12:31.315 --> 12:33.013
So, how long do you think
this is gonna take?

12:33.143 --> 12:34.623
I don't know, Jay.
This is my first time

12:34.754 --> 12:36.799
having to get a ghost Viking
to a designated scream spot,

12:36.930 --> 12:39.062
where he will reunite with his
father after a thousand years.

12:39.193 --> 12:41.499
Ballpark?
Five minutes?

12:43.980 --> 12:45.286
Weird. It's open.

12:50.639 --> 12:52.206
Oh, my God,
Henry, it's Sam and Jay.

12:52.336 --> 12:55.078
I told you.
Hello, please come in.

12:55.209 --> 12:56.776
Hi, uh, we came
to return your lamp.

12:56.906 --> 12:58.516
And I know
you don't take returns...

12:58.647 --> 13:00.301
That is so cute.

13:00.431 --> 13:02.042
But you didn't have
to make up an excuse

13:02.172 --> 13:04.000
to come
to our little get-together.

13:04.131 --> 13:05.349
Oh, you have company.

13:05.480 --> 13:06.829
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.223
Oh, no, no.
We're so glad you could make it.

13:09.353 --> 13:10.790
May I please use your bathroom?

13:10.920 --> 13:12.182
Yes. Yes, of course.

13:12.313 --> 13:14.402
And don't worry,
we won't start without you.

13:14.532 --> 13:16.317
Thanks.

13:17.318 --> 13:21.975
Come with us. Our friends will
be very excited to meet you.

13:23.106 --> 13:24.847
Everybody,
this is our neighbor Jay

13:24.978 --> 13:26.240
and he's here for the party

13:26.370 --> 13:29.243
with his wife, Sam,
who's a blonde.

13:31.767 --> 13:34.378
Oh, how I hate the first
Wednesday of every month.

13:35.902 --> 13:39.035
Okay, so that's my house
over there.

13:39.166 --> 13:41.733
Your father should be appearing
at that window at any moment.

13:47.783 --> 13:49.567
Oh, I see someone.

13:49.698 --> 13:53.441
Hello! Bjorn is here!

13:53.571 --> 13:56.226
It is Bjorn!

13:56.357 --> 13:59.360
Just a moment!
Thor'll be right here!

13:59.490 --> 14:01.971
Tell him I'm very excited!

14:02.102 --> 14:03.886
He's equally excited!

14:04.017 --> 14:05.845
Of that, I can assure you!

14:05.975 --> 14:07.890
A Fin, I could live with that.

14:08.021 --> 14:10.675
A Swede, disgusting, but fine.

14:10.806 --> 14:12.199
But why Dane?

14:12.329 --> 14:14.810
Why you do that to me?

14:14.941 --> 14:17.334
Dude, Denmark is
actually pretty cool.

14:17.465 --> 14:19.902
I mean, I've never been,
but I used to buy Whippets

14:20.033 --> 14:23.210
from a Danish guy at Dead shows
and he was really cool.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.255
Okay, Thor.
It's showtime.

14:25.386 --> 14:27.344
Your son is waiting
for you.

14:27.475 --> 14:29.303
I said I don't want
to talk to him.

14:29.433 --> 14:32.001
Thor, he traveled
half the world and waited

14:32.132 --> 14:34.308
a thousand years
just to find you.

14:34.438 --> 14:37.137
That's more work than I put
in to meet David Crosby.

14:37.267 --> 14:39.226
Thor not care.
Can you imagine

14:39.356 --> 14:41.532
the disappointment
he is going to feel right now

14:41.663 --> 14:43.143
if you abandon him?

14:43.273 --> 14:44.666
You are his father.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.713
- You're right.
- Oh...

14:49.758 --> 14:53.370
He is under the impression
that I am his father,

14:53.501 --> 14:55.198
so I will speak to him,

14:55.329 --> 14:59.246
and tell him
he is no longer my son!

14:59.376 --> 15:02.379
Okay. It feels like you're
deliberately twisting my words.

15:03.554 --> 15:05.817
I miss Whippets.

15:08.385 --> 15:10.387
How are you doing, Trevor?

15:10.518 --> 15:13.347
Me? I'm awesome.

15:13.477 --> 15:15.088
Nine and a half
<i>Cutting Edges</i> in,

15:15.218 --> 15:16.524
and it just
keeps getting better.

15:16.654 --> 15:19.135
Are you sure?
You look a little glum.

15:19.266 --> 15:21.485
Man just lost
his peripheral vision.

15:21.616 --> 15:23.313
Of course I'm a little glum.

15:23.444 --> 15:25.141
But exclusively about that.

15:25.272 --> 15:28.884
Tell me,
when you were alive...

15:31.017 --> 15:32.453
...why did you want
to make money?

15:32.583 --> 15:33.889
Excuse me?

15:34.020 --> 15:34.977
Let's say you had not died

15:35.108 --> 15:37.284
tragically young
and without pants

15:37.414 --> 15:38.938
and you had made
all the money you'd ever wanted.

15:39.068 --> 15:40.461
what would your life
have looked like?

15:40.591 --> 15:42.115
Paint me a picture.

15:42.245 --> 15:44.944
Okay. Um...

15:45.074 --> 15:46.293
I'm in a glass-bottom pool

15:46.423 --> 15:48.425
on top of a skyscraper
that I own,

15:48.556 --> 15:50.514
and Kid Rock is there
and he's deejaying,

15:50.645 --> 15:51.689
but not because I'm paying him,

15:51.820 --> 15:53.735
because he's just there

15:53.865 --> 15:55.519
and it happens spontaneously.

15:55.650 --> 15:57.565
And we have an epic party.

15:57.695 --> 16:01.003
And afterwards, I make love
to my wife, Tara Reid,

16:01.134 --> 16:04.833
and post-coitus, together,
we watch <i>The Cutting Edge.</i>

16:04.964 --> 16:06.313
Duh.

16:06.443 --> 16:08.271
It seems like money

16:08.402 --> 16:10.578
wasn't just about money, then.

16:10.708 --> 16:12.188
It was about friends.

16:12.319 --> 16:15.191
About having
someone to share it with.

16:15.322 --> 16:16.584
I guess so.

16:16.714 --> 16:19.456
But now, your pursuit of wealth

16:19.587 --> 16:21.763
has left you
all alone.

16:21.893 --> 16:24.940
Take it from someone
who actually was rich.

16:26.463 --> 16:27.987
It's lonely at the top.

16:29.597 --> 16:31.033
The question you have
to ask yourself is...

16:32.208 --> 16:33.427
...is it worth it?

16:39.302 --> 16:40.521
<i>Hold up.</i>

16:40.651 --> 16:42.175
You have a toy room, too?

16:42.305 --> 16:44.133
I love how excited
you are about this.

16:44.264 --> 16:46.309
Sam thinks I'm a freak
for having one.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.746
You know, I wasn't
into it at first, either.

16:48.877 --> 16:49.965
You just gotta
play around a little bit

16:50.096 --> 16:51.575
till you find the ones you like.

16:51.706 --> 16:54.839
Can we trade wives?

16:54.970 --> 16:57.407
Uh, and on that note,
ladies and gentlemen,

16:57.538 --> 16:59.061
the time has come.

16:59.192 --> 17:00.932
Is this because
I didn't breastfeed you?

17:04.849 --> 17:06.634
What you doin', Margaret?

17:07.896 --> 17:09.028
Oh, um...

17:11.334 --> 17:13.206
Ah.

17:15.121 --> 17:17.732
After some careful
consideration, I have decided

17:17.862 --> 17:19.212
to give everyone
their TV time back.

17:19.342 --> 17:20.517
What's the catch?

17:20.648 --> 17:22.345
No catch.

17:22.476 --> 17:23.564
It's just,
someone made me realize that

17:23.694 --> 17:25.566
while money is important,

17:25.696 --> 17:27.350
it's not as important

17:27.481 --> 17:29.700
as friendship. Aw.

17:29.831 --> 17:31.267
I had all the TV time
in the world,

17:31.398 --> 17:33.269
I just didn't have anyone
to share it with.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.793
Alberta...

17:35.924 --> 17:38.057
I believe
tonight's pick is yours.

17:38.187 --> 17:39.971
<i>Aquaman.</i>
Then, if there's time,

17:40.102 --> 17:42.191
select scenes
from <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

17:42.322 --> 17:44.019
And you know the ones
I'm talkin' about.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.282
Have a seat.

17:46.413 --> 17:49.068
Proud of you for learning
the right lesson, buddy.

17:49.198 --> 17:51.374
Alberta, I'll give you 200 back
rubs to watch <i>Bodices & Barons.</i>

17:51.505 --> 17:53.420
- Wait, what?
- Sold.

17:53.550 --> 17:55.683
Hetty, you didn't mean any
of that stuff you said to me?

17:55.813 --> 17:57.293
You just tricked me into
giving up my monopoly?

17:57.424 --> 17:58.338
That's right.

17:58.468 --> 18:00.079
And what about your speech?

18:00.209 --> 18:01.819
You said that friendship
was more important than wealth.

18:01.950 --> 18:04.431
No, I said you need
to ask yourself that.

18:04.561 --> 18:07.260
I have and I know the answer.
It's wealth.

18:07.390 --> 18:08.957
Oh, it's wealth.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.306
That's why she's the top dog.

18:10.437 --> 18:12.352
There's no low
she won't stoop to.

18:12.482 --> 18:15.920
It's time to watch the baron
glance at his mistress.

18:16.051 --> 18:19.185
The glancing, oh,
how I love the glancing.

18:21.796 --> 18:22.971
Thor, wait...

18:23.102 --> 18:24.842
Bjorn! Are you there?

18:24.973 --> 18:27.149
Yes, I'm here!

18:27.280 --> 18:30.109
Thor, please don't say
something you can't take back.

18:30.239 --> 18:31.414
Bjorn!

18:31.545 --> 18:33.590
I have something to tell you!

18:33.721 --> 18:35.766
What is it, Father?

18:37.159 --> 18:38.421
Hello?

18:38.552 --> 18:39.727
Father?

18:41.163 --> 18:44.123
Come on, you can do it.

18:44.253 --> 18:47.126
Say, "Father."

18:47.561 --> 18:49.693
Hello?

18:49.824 --> 18:51.652
Father!

18:51.782 --> 18:53.784
Are you still there?

18:55.482 --> 18:57.310
I am here, son!

18:57.440 --> 18:59.834
What did you want to say?

18:59.964 --> 19:01.705
That...

19:01.836 --> 19:04.230
I love you!

19:04.360 --> 19:06.275
Thank you for coming to find me!

19:06.406 --> 19:07.798
I love you, too!

19:09.800 --> 19:11.062
Okay!

19:11.759 --> 19:13.543
Good talk!

19:13.674 --> 19:15.763
Yes. Yes, great talk!

19:16.981 --> 19:19.114
That's... That's it?

19:19.897 --> 19:21.856
- We gotta get out of here.
- Jay,

19:21.986 --> 19:23.423
the sweetest thing happened.

19:23.553 --> 19:25.729
Yeah? Do you think we can
climb out that window,

19:25.860 --> 19:27.035
or should we just jump?

19:27.166 --> 19:28.210
Can't we just
go down the stairs

19:28.341 --> 19:29.429
and walk out the front door?

19:29.559 --> 19:31.213
Okay.

19:31.344 --> 19:33.433
Take my hand,
close your eyes

19:33.563 --> 19:37.045
and whatever you do,
don't touch anything.

19:47.142 --> 19:47.969
<i>Oh. We got an email
from the Farnsbys.</i>

19:48.099 --> 19:50.754
Apparently,
we've been invited

19:50.885 --> 19:54.062
to their Christmas Toga Party
this year.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.151
That is chilling.

19:57.761 --> 19:59.328
Sam. Hello?

19:59.459 --> 20:00.938
Sorry,
just a little distracted.

20:01.069 --> 20:02.679
They steal silverware!

20:02.810 --> 20:05.465
It's very important
to know!
Look, Thor.

20:05.595 --> 20:07.728
I think it's great you're
reconnecting with your son,

20:07.858 --> 20:10.165
but maybe you could do it
during daylight hours.

20:10.296 --> 20:11.688
Making up for lost time.

20:11.819 --> 20:14.387
You see, I realize
it is not Bjorn's fault

20:14.517 --> 20:16.432
that he married Dane.

20:16.563 --> 20:19.479
Children not born
with hate in their heart,

20:19.609 --> 20:22.830
they must be taught it and
I was not there to teach him.

20:25.572 --> 20:27.008
Night, babe.

20:27.138 --> 20:29.097
Now let's talk hygiene!

20:29.228 --> 20:31.273
Danes, very dirty!

20:31.404 --> 20:32.796
They never wash
undercarriage!
