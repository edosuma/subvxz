00:03.438 --> 00:06.049
ERIC:
Tiffany Williams, multiple
arrests for prostitution

00:06.093 --> 00:08.008
and she was Deeks' LAPD
informant.

00:08.051 --> 00:09.226
She was a good person
who got stuck in

00:09.270 --> 00:10.619
a bad spot
and I helped her out.

00:10.662 --> 00:12.882
I was a 17-year-old hooker
with a criminal record.

00:12.925 --> 00:14.492
He helped me get back
on my feet.

00:14.536 --> 00:16.103
Detective Ellen Whiting,
Internal Affairs.

00:16.146 --> 00:17.626
DEEKS:
Have I told you how
much I missed you?

00:17.669 --> 00:18.714
Sokolov!

00:20.672 --> 00:22.892
CALLEN:
Anna, where's his gun?

00:22.935 --> 00:25.025
He was already dead when you
came through that door.

00:25.068 --> 00:27.027
And I was holding my gun;
that's all you saw.

00:27.070 --> 00:28.506
GOMEZ:
Special Agent Callen,

00:28.550 --> 00:31.901
did you see Mr. Sokolov
reaching for a weapon

00:31.944 --> 00:35.035
before he was shot
by Agent Kolcheck?

00:38.386 --> 00:40.779
♪ Never too young

00:40.823 --> 00:42.216
♪ Never too old...

00:47.960 --> 00:49.397
Mmm, smells good.

00:49.440 --> 00:50.659
What is that?

00:50.702 --> 00:51.921
It's cold.

00:51.964 --> 00:53.966
You were supposed
to be back by 10:00.

00:54.010 --> 00:54.880
You made meatloaf.

00:54.924 --> 00:56.491
You do love me.

00:56.534 --> 00:59.276
Tiffany, I'm serious.

00:59.320 --> 01:02.932
You got a big day tomorrow.
Don't give me that look.

01:02.975 --> 01:04.455
It's not a look,
it's my face.

01:04.499 --> 01:05.935
What are you, 12?

01:05.978 --> 01:09.069
I didn't come up with this
curfew idea, the judge did.

01:09.112 --> 01:10.418
I know.

01:10.461 --> 01:11.941
Then why are you playing
so fast and loose with it?

01:11.984 --> 01:13.682
Why are you
dressed like that?

01:13.725 --> 01:15.031
And the makeup.

01:16.728 --> 01:20.341
Mom, I've been good,
I promise.

01:20.384 --> 01:21.690
Some might even
call me an angel.

01:21.733 --> 01:24.910
Now I know you're lying.

01:24.954 --> 01:26.651
This is not like it was before.

01:26.695 --> 01:27.826
Well, you could have fooled me.

01:27.870 --> 01:29.350
I didn't do it.

01:29.393 --> 01:30.786
I was never
into that stuff.

01:30.829 --> 01:32.831
You know that.
You have to believe me.

01:33.832 --> 01:36.574
I love you, Mom.

01:36.618 --> 01:38.489
Get over here.

01:43.929 --> 01:45.061
Tiffany Williams,
you're under arrest.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.584
No. No, no, no, no, no!

01:46.628 --> 01:47.977
You have the right
to remain silent.Stop it!

01:48.020 --> 01:49.370
Look at what
you're doing to her!

01:49.413 --> 01:50.806
You're hurting her!

01:50.849 --> 01:52.329
OFFICER:
Anything you do or say

01:52.373 --> 01:54.070
can and will be
used against you.

01:57.552 --> 01:59.554
♪

02:23.360 --> 02:24.883
Callen.

02:26.102 --> 02:27.277
It's so good to see you.

02:27.321 --> 02:30.106
It's good to see you.

02:30.150 --> 02:30.933
I was so glad you called.

02:30.976 --> 02:32.064
Uh, sit.

02:33.109 --> 02:34.458
I ordered you a coffee.

02:34.502 --> 02:37.200
And, uh, I thought maybe
we could split a croissant?

02:37.244 --> 02:39.246
Sounds good.

02:39.289 --> 02:41.161
I've missed you.

02:41.204 --> 02:42.684
How have you been?

02:42.727 --> 02:44.294
What are you doing?

02:44.338 --> 02:45.730
What do you mean?

02:45.774 --> 02:46.949
Why are you acting like this?

02:46.992 --> 02:47.950
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:47.993 --> 02:50.039
I thought this was clear.

02:50.082 --> 02:51.083
We're playing make-believe.

02:51.127 --> 02:52.955
You see, this is
a magical restaurant

02:52.998 --> 02:55.218
run by elves where
they sprinkle fairy dust

02:55.262 --> 02:57.002
all over your food,
and we pretend

02:57.046 --> 02:58.874
that the real world
doesn't exist.

02:58.917 --> 03:01.137
I'm gonna go.Or stay-- Do whatever you want.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.357
Just...I'm gonna have that croissant.

03:03.400 --> 03:06.969
Is this about what I said
at the ATF hearing?

03:07.012 --> 03:09.232
No, it's because
you forgot Valentine's Day.

03:09.276 --> 03:11.582
All I told them...Was whatever helped you

03:11.626 --> 03:13.105
sleep at night.

03:14.106 --> 03:15.499
That's not fair.

03:18.154 --> 03:20.983
It was bad enough the ATF
suspended me

03:21.026 --> 03:23.768
for doing what we both know
was the right thing.

03:23.812 --> 03:26.031
Now, thanks to you,
it's just a matter of time

03:26.075 --> 03:28.120
before my lawyer calls me
for an arraignment.

03:28.164 --> 03:29.774
Oh, does anyone really think
it's gonna go that far?

03:31.428 --> 03:34.388
You know, I-I think
about you and I wonder.

03:34.431 --> 03:37.391
If the tables
had been reversed...

03:37.434 --> 03:40.655
Anna...
...would you have
pulled that trigger?

03:40.698 --> 03:44.093
If someone as deranged as
Sokolov kidnapped your father,

03:44.136 --> 03:46.095
and you had the chance
to end him,

03:46.138 --> 03:47.531
would you have taken the shot?

03:49.185 --> 03:51.666
Anna...

03:51.709 --> 03:54.059
I am really sorry that
you're going through this.

03:57.019 --> 03:59.021
I mean that.

03:59.064 --> 04:00.631
And you sound very convincing.

04:00.675 --> 04:03.504
Did you practice that
before coming over?

04:03.547 --> 04:04.983
Okay, you know what?
This was fun.

04:05.027 --> 04:07.986
Yeah, no, I enjoyed myself.So is that it for us, eh?

04:08.030 --> 04:09.336
I don't know.

04:11.033 --> 04:14.776
I'm obviously
working through some stuff.

04:14.819 --> 04:16.256
Enjoy your croissant.

04:17.518 --> 04:18.867
Callen, wait.

04:18.910 --> 04:21.130
Wait. Just wait.

04:23.175 --> 04:25.308
Just...

04:25.352 --> 04:27.919
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.

04:27.963 --> 04:31.314
I'm-I'm frustrated
and I'm scared.

04:32.924 --> 04:34.404
I don't mean to
take it out on you.

04:34.448 --> 04:38.016
Just... don't change
your number.

04:38.060 --> 04:39.540
I won't.

05:00.865 --> 05:03.868
Your Honor, ADA Sofia Lopez
for the state.

05:03.912 --> 05:06.131
And Joel Simoni for the defense.
Good morning.

05:06.175 --> 05:09.134
Not exactly. I was hoping
to hear pre-trial motions today,

05:09.178 --> 05:11.006
but I understand those
will have to wait.

05:11.049 --> 05:12.442
LOPEZ:
As I'm sure you're aware,

05:12.486 --> 05:14.357
the defendant violated
the terms of her bail

05:14.401 --> 05:16.011
and was brought back
into custody last night.

05:16.054 --> 05:17.795
JUDGE LEE:
Of course I'm aware.

05:17.839 --> 05:21.016
What did you think
I was referring to?LOPEZ: Right.

05:21.059 --> 05:22.931
According to LAPD,

05:22.974 --> 05:24.367
the defendant engaged
in solicitation...

05:24.411 --> 05:26.151
What?

05:26.195 --> 05:28.023
Of which I am also aware.LOPEZ: Given the defendant's

05:28.066 --> 05:31.069
high risk of flight, her not
insignificant criminal history,

05:31.113 --> 05:34.246
and the danger and harm she
poses to others, not to mention

05:34.290 --> 05:36.248
her prior charges of possession

05:36.292 --> 05:38.033
with intent to distribute
narcotics...

05:38.076 --> 05:39.295
JUDGE LEE:
ADA Lopez.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.950
I read your motion.Right.

05:41.993 --> 05:43.778
Of course.

05:43.821 --> 05:45.257
SIMONI:
Your Honor,

05:45.301 --> 05:47.259
these new prostitution charges
are completely baseless.

05:47.303 --> 05:48.609
There's no way to prove

05:48.652 --> 05:51.046
that my client did anything
remotely close to...

05:51.089 --> 05:53.309
Well, that's lucky.Excuse me?

05:53.353 --> 05:55.311
The state doesn't need to prove
your client did anything.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.270
I'm sorry?Mr. Simoni,

05:58.314 --> 06:01.448
we're not living in the world
of reasonable doubt... yet.

06:01.491 --> 06:03.711
The state believes your client
committed a misdemeanor

06:03.754 --> 06:06.409
while she was out on bail.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.368
Is it likely she did it?

06:08.411 --> 06:09.281
Your Honor, my
client would nev...JUDGE LEE: Uh-uh-uh.

06:09.325 --> 06:11.719
You already had your turn.

06:11.762 --> 06:14.591
I read both your motions--
and ADA Lopez,

06:14.635 --> 06:18.073
you need to learn when to use
"who" and when to use "whom,"

06:18.116 --> 06:20.902
but yours was the more
compelling of the two.

06:20.945 --> 06:23.034
Bail is vacated,

06:23.078 --> 06:24.819
defendant is remanded to jail,
and pre-trial motions

06:24.862 --> 06:26.821
are scheduled for three weeks
from today.

06:27.865 --> 06:29.127
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

06:29.171 --> 06:30.390
What just happened?Nothing.

06:30.433 --> 06:31.695
Everything will be fine.Fine?

06:31.739 --> 06:33.480
I don't get to go home?
Are you serious?

06:53.325 --> 06:58.113
Ugh.
This can't be happening.

06:58.156 --> 06:59.549
We got to call
Callen and Sam.

06:59.593 --> 07:01.203
No, we don't have
to call Callen and Sam,

07:01.246 --> 07:02.422
we need to do something.

07:02.465 --> 07:04.032
Hey, Simoni.
Yes.KENSI: No, no, no.

07:04.075 --> 07:05.425
Deeks, don't do this.
Please, don't...

07:05.468 --> 07:06.687
Hey, so you're Tiffany's
only lifeline in there,

07:06.730 --> 07:08.428
and you can't get the burden
of proof right?

07:08.471 --> 07:10.342
I'm sorry, do I know you?She's got no support
from her friends,

07:10.386 --> 07:11.822
she's got no love
from her family,

07:11.866 --> 07:14.172
she can't hold down her job,
so even if by some miracle

07:14.216 --> 07:15.957
you do get her off,
she's got to rebuild her life

07:16.000 --> 07:18.220
from scratch after she gets out.

07:18.263 --> 07:19.526
This is me walking away.No, this is you listening,

07:19.569 --> 07:20.570
'cause now it's gonna be
incredibly hard

07:20.614 --> 07:21.615
for you to meet with her,

07:21.658 --> 07:22.833
and incredibly easy

07:22.877 --> 07:24.052
for the ADA to force a plea

07:24.095 --> 07:25.357
while she's miserable,

07:25.401 --> 07:26.968
stuck in county
because you're an idiot

07:27.011 --> 07:28.186
and can't get
the burden of proof right.

07:28.230 --> 07:29.057
And this is good-bye.

07:29.100 --> 07:30.232
Good work, counselor.

07:30.275 --> 07:31.712
Deeks, let it...
Just let it go.

07:31.755 --> 07:34.105
Just let it go.Really wish he could.

07:34.149 --> 07:35.498
Oh, my God.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.369
But that's not
your forte...

07:37.413 --> 07:39.241
is it, Deeks Oh, my God.

07:39.284 --> 07:41.417
Well, especially
not with this chick.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.418
Hello, Kensi.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.985
Detective Whiting.

07:44.028 --> 07:46.770
There is so much more to this
that you don't understand.

07:46.814 --> 07:48.468
There's always
more to the story.

07:48.511 --> 07:49.991
Yeah, there actually is.

07:50.034 --> 07:52.210
What is it about
Tiffany Williams, I wonder?

07:52.254 --> 07:54.256
'Cause no matter how many
wrong turns that girl takes,

07:54.299 --> 07:57.477
you just can't help
yourself around her.

07:57.520 --> 07:58.869
And you're okay with that.

07:58.913 --> 08:00.436
Let's go, Deeks.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.220
Huh.

08:02.264 --> 08:04.571
Still rockin'
that pantsuit, I see.

08:06.660 --> 08:08.313
TTYL, Deeks.

08:08.357 --> 08:10.968
TTYL.

08:11.012 --> 08:12.535
Hey.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.842
You speak to Kensi?

08:14.885 --> 08:17.366
I just hung up with her.

08:17.409 --> 08:18.454
It's not good.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.629
I know.

08:19.673 --> 08:21.196
Not good at all.

08:21.239 --> 08:24.112
Thank you, Captain Obvious.

08:24.155 --> 08:25.417
Well, it's good to see
you're in a good mood.

08:25.461 --> 08:26.723
That'll make
the day go by easier.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.203
So what are we
gonna do about this?

08:28.246 --> 08:30.640
Depends.Is Kilbride around?

08:30.684 --> 08:31.902
That's what it depends on.

08:35.253 --> 08:37.691
No.

08:37.734 --> 08:38.692
But I'm telling you...

08:38.735 --> 08:40.520
ERIC:
Oh.

08:40.563 --> 08:42.478
You two definitely woke up
on the wrong side of the bed

08:42.522 --> 08:44.349
this morning.What gave it away?

08:44.393 --> 08:46.134
Let me guess.Um, no, Eric.

08:46.177 --> 08:47.570
No, but it'll be good.
It'll, like, lighten the mood.

08:47.614 --> 08:50.399
Super fun.
It's not your job,
so not your job.

08:50.442 --> 08:51.574
Is Kilbride around?He's not.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.881
He's still in D.C.
The deputy director

08:53.924 --> 08:55.360
just joined him there.

08:55.404 --> 08:58.276
What about Special Prosecutor
Rogers and his people?

08:58.320 --> 08:59.495
He moved off campus.
Our accommodations

08:59.539 --> 09:01.453
were not accommodate-y enough.

09:01.497 --> 09:03.238
But he left parting gifts
before taking off.CALLEN: Yeah.

09:03.281 --> 09:04.892
I'm sorry, parting gifts?CALLEN:
They served all of us

09:04.935 --> 09:06.458
with subpoenas.Whoa.

09:06.502 --> 09:08.504
Where's Mosley?She's off the grid.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.811
Well, administrative leave
will do that to you, won't it?

09:10.854 --> 09:13.161
Or a cartel putting
a price on your head.Yeah. How about Hetty?

09:13.204 --> 09:15.163
I don't know where Hetty is
or what she's up to.

09:16.512 --> 09:18.253
We can work with that.

09:18.296 --> 09:19.297
I agree.

09:19.341 --> 09:20.516
I'm sorry. So what's
going on here?

09:23.475 --> 09:25.260
Do you remember
Tiffany Williams?

09:25.303 --> 09:27.131
The woman Deeks was helping out?

09:27.175 --> 09:30.047
Wasn't she somehow involved
with Detective Boyle,

09:30.091 --> 09:31.614
Deeks' old partner at LAPD?

09:31.658 --> 09:32.876
Right.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.051
"Involved" would be
a slight understatement.

09:35.313 --> 09:36.663
Why

09:36.706 --> 09:39.317
Four months ago she was
picked up at a drug bust.

09:39.361 --> 09:41.145
She was released on bail,
and then last night,

09:41.189 --> 09:44.932
LAPD picked her up on new
charges of prostitution.

09:44.975 --> 09:46.934
Oh, boy.Wait. Does Deeks know?

09:46.977 --> 09:48.762
He and Kensi were at
her hearing this morning.

09:48.805 --> 09:51.503
Things did not go Tiffany's way,
and now it is on us to help her.

09:51.547 --> 09:55.420
Okay. So are-are you thinking
that she may be innocent

09:55.464 --> 09:57.858
of the narcotics charges
from four months ago?

09:57.901 --> 09:59.381
And the prostitution charges
from last night?

09:59.424 --> 10:01.949
Yeah, we are pretty sure
of that.

10:01.992 --> 10:03.646
Mm, what makes you think so?

10:03.690 --> 10:05.343
Because when she was
allegedly selling

10:05.387 --> 10:06.910
and soliciting
on a street corner,

10:06.954 --> 10:09.304
Tiffany Williams was actually
working as an informant.

10:09.347 --> 10:10.566
For who?

10:10.610 --> 10:12.524
For us.

10:12.568 --> 10:14.657
Oh. So she has an alibi.

10:14.701 --> 10:16.180
Yeah.

10:16.224 --> 10:18.313
Only problem is
she can't use it.

10:31.805 --> 10:34.546
So, about six months ago, a guy
named Phillip Robbins stole

10:34.590 --> 10:35.852
proprietary naval
security software

10:35.896 --> 10:37.549
and sold it to Iran.

10:37.593 --> 10:39.508
SAM: Or so we think.
NCIS still doesn't

10:39.551 --> 10:41.423
have enough to move on him.KENSI: Case originated

10:41.466 --> 10:42.990
at the D.C. office,
but they brought it to us

10:43.033 --> 10:44.513
when they realized
that Robbins

10:44.556 --> 10:46.820
spends most of the
year in Los Angeles.DEEKS: And most

10:46.863 --> 10:49.300
of his time and money
on petite, blonde prostitutes.

10:49.344 --> 10:51.172
And that brings us
to Tiffany Williams.

10:51.215 --> 10:53.565
Back in the day, he was one
of her most loyal johns.

10:53.609 --> 10:56.177
And by loyal, I mean he was
completely obsessed with her.

10:56.220 --> 10:59.049
So NCIS recruited her
to help us get to him.

10:59.093 --> 11:00.268
CALLEN:
And it worked.

11:00.311 --> 11:01.312
We've been tracking
him for six months,

11:01.356 --> 11:02.705
building a
very solid case

11:02.749 --> 11:04.968
until Tiffany got arrested
for a bogus drug charge.

11:05.012 --> 11:06.883
So now that she's out
of the picture...?

11:06.927 --> 11:08.972
KENSI: We're back to zero.
As soon as Tiffany got arrested,

11:09.016 --> 11:11.322
Robbins vanished
and the case completely stalled.

11:11.366 --> 11:13.063
Right.

11:13.107 --> 11:14.935
Sam?

11:16.110 --> 11:17.720
What?

11:17.764 --> 11:19.591
Might not be
a bogus drug charge.

11:19.635 --> 11:20.680
Just saying.

11:20.723 --> 11:21.768
Come on, man.
Let's not do this.

11:21.811 --> 11:22.856
No one wants to
talk about it, but

11:22.899 --> 11:24.466
four months ago,
when she was arrested,

11:24.509 --> 11:26.555
there was an hour that
we don't know about.

11:26.598 --> 11:28.165
We don't know where she was
or what she was doing.

11:28.209 --> 11:29.601
Well, that's easy. I'll just--

11:29.645 --> 11:31.212
CALLEN: No, you can't.
Cell phone was turned off.

11:31.255 --> 11:32.300
We couldn't find anything

11:32.343 --> 11:33.475
through traffic
or security cameras

11:33.518 --> 11:35.433
or by stitching together
social media.

11:35.477 --> 11:37.479
And she won't give us
a straight answer.

11:37.522 --> 11:39.002
Well, that complicates
things, doesn't it?

11:39.046 --> 11:40.874
Yeah, but I don't trust
the officers that arrested her.

11:44.878 --> 11:46.880
Maybe Detective Whiting
doesn't either.

11:46.923 --> 11:49.491
I mean, she showed up at
Tiffany's hearing this morning.

11:49.534 --> 11:50.753
Wow, that sounds
like a party.

11:50.797 --> 11:52.363
Yeah, I don't know, Deeks.

11:52.407 --> 11:54.235
I mean, Whiting is
Internal Affairs.

11:55.497 --> 11:57.891
She might be our best shot.

11:57.934 --> 11:59.893
Well, if that's the case,

11:59.936 --> 12:03.592
then she's in even more trouble
than we feared.

12:03.635 --> 12:05.159
Uh, was that code
for "he'll do it

12:05.202 --> 12:06.769
even though he doesn't want to"?KENSI: Yeah.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.118
Basically, yeah.

12:08.162 --> 12:10.381
WHITING:
Well, this is festive.

12:10.425 --> 12:13.210
Can you stop the tough guy act
for, like, a second?

12:13.254 --> 12:14.646
What makes you think
it's an act?

12:14.690 --> 12:16.213
Baby, I was born this way.

12:16.257 --> 12:18.128
Before Tiffany Williams
was arrested,

12:18.172 --> 12:19.956
she was working
undercover for NCIS.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.045
She was helping us get close
to someone we believe

12:22.089 --> 12:24.134
stole proprietary
technology and sold it

12:24.178 --> 12:25.440
to a hostile
foreign government.

12:25.483 --> 12:28.617
I stopped listening
after you said "undercover."

12:28.660 --> 12:29.966
Of course you did.And what, may I ask,

12:30.010 --> 12:31.663
was Tiffany's
super secret persona?

12:31.707 --> 12:33.448
She was working undercover
as a prostitute.

12:34.492 --> 12:36.146
So, a real stretch.

12:36.190 --> 12:37.974
Oh, my God. You
are unbelievable.

12:38.018 --> 12:39.715
And you need to grow up and
stop believing in fairy tales.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.109
Listen, the drug bust
wasn't real. You know that.

12:42.152 --> 12:43.850
Eight ounces of cocaine
says otherwise.

12:43.893 --> 12:45.503
No. It wasn't worth it.
She wouldn't go back.

12:45.547 --> 12:47.984
That is the only thing that
surprises me about this case.

12:48.028 --> 12:49.594
What's that?

12:49.638 --> 12:52.554
Nobody knows Tiffany
better than you.

12:52.597 --> 12:54.469
And yet you somehow thought
it was a good idea

12:54.512 --> 12:55.862
to deliver her back
to the world

12:55.905 --> 12:57.385
that she's worked so hard
to leave behind?

12:57.428 --> 13:00.127
Wasn't-- it wasn't like that.Pretty sure it was.

13:00.170 --> 13:01.345
And then temptation
got too great

13:01.389 --> 13:02.825
and she fell back on bad habits.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.348
But I'm not telling you anything
you don't already know,

13:04.392 --> 13:05.523
am I, Deeks?

13:05.567 --> 13:07.134
That's not fair.
Tiffany was innocent.

13:08.178 --> 13:10.790
You keep telling yourself that.

13:13.923 --> 13:16.491
She doesn't belong in prison.

13:16.534 --> 13:18.406
Can't help you, Deeks.

13:18.449 --> 13:21.061
Well, that's a shocker.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.891
ELIZABETH: Sorry,

13:24.934 --> 13:26.718
so you two
aren't cops?

13:26.762 --> 13:29.721
Uh, different agency.
We-We're NCIS.

13:29.765 --> 13:31.985
Naval Criminal
Investigative Service.

13:32.028 --> 13:33.987
The Navy?

13:34.030 --> 13:35.771
Oh, geez.

13:37.207 --> 13:39.166
What did Tiffany do this time?

13:39.209 --> 13:40.994
It's not like that. We just
want to ask you a few questions.

13:41.037 --> 13:42.909
So, has your daughter
been acting different

13:42.952 --> 13:44.432
over the last few months?
Any new friends?

13:44.475 --> 13:45.999
New places
she's hanging out?

13:46.042 --> 13:47.522
I don't know
if it was anywhere new,

13:47.565 --> 13:49.219
but she was definitely
hanging out again.

13:49.263 --> 13:52.222
Hadn't done that
for a long time.

13:52.266 --> 13:54.224
How so?Well,

13:54.268 --> 13:56.313
once Tiffany
got her act together,

13:56.357 --> 13:58.011
she became a homebody.

13:58.054 --> 14:00.883
She'd go to work at the nursery
every day, and then it was

14:00.927 --> 14:02.667
her, me...

14:02.711 --> 14:05.322
...Chip and Jo every night.

14:06.671 --> 14:08.151
What about friends?

14:08.195 --> 14:09.370
No, I can't
help you there.

14:09.413 --> 14:11.415
She never told me anything
about anyone.

14:12.460 --> 14:14.070
Except...

14:14.114 --> 14:15.680
CALLEN:
What?

14:15.724 --> 14:16.899
Her lawyer.

14:16.943 --> 14:19.902
Apparently, this
friend of hers

14:19.946 --> 14:22.209
found the guy
and is even paying for him.

14:22.252 --> 14:24.124
The lawyer's supposed to be
from some fancy firm,

14:24.167 --> 14:27.127
but you wouldn't know it by how
things went down this morning.

14:28.345 --> 14:29.651
E-Excuse me.

14:31.435 --> 14:33.220
Hello?

14:35.091 --> 14:38.660
One of Tiffany's friends
is covering her legal fees.

14:39.704 --> 14:41.881
We know it's not Deeks.

14:43.621 --> 14:45.449
We know the rest of her circle.

14:45.493 --> 14:46.755
At least, we thought we did.

14:46.798 --> 14:48.191
Could be Phillip Robbins.

14:48.235 --> 14:51.629
We follow the money,
we may find him.

14:51.673 --> 14:53.980
I'll call Eric.

15:00.464 --> 15:02.423
There you are.

15:02.466 --> 15:04.381
Hey.

15:05.469 --> 15:07.167
How did it go with
Detective Whiting?

15:07.210 --> 15:10.170
At least I can say
I checked the box.

15:10.213 --> 15:11.475
I'm sorry.

15:11.519 --> 15:13.303
We'll figure something else out.I really thought

15:13.347 --> 15:14.826
that Tiffany could handle this.
I-I never...

15:14.870 --> 15:16.263
Sweetie, I know.

15:16.306 --> 15:18.134
I know you did.

15:18.178 --> 15:19.875
You know, you do
this job long enough,

15:19.919 --> 15:23.009
you forget there's a reason NCIS
has a psychologist on staff.

15:23.052 --> 15:24.227
Sweetie,
whatever happens,

15:24.271 --> 15:25.881
this is absolutely
not your fault.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.883
Don't do that. We both
know this is on me.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.277
Deeks, it is not...No, come on. I was so
focused on the case,

15:30.320 --> 15:32.888
I lost sight of the position
I was putting Tiffany into.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.803
I mean, I never should've
asked her to help us.

15:34.846 --> 15:37.414
And you know that. The truth is
is Sam's right. We have no idea

15:37.458 --> 15:40.069
where she was
for that hour she was missing.

15:40.113 --> 15:42.463
I mean, think about it.
She left the boatshed at 8:00.

15:42.506 --> 15:43.464
It should've taken her, what,

15:43.507 --> 15:44.900
20 minutes
to get to the bar?

15:44.944 --> 15:46.032
That's being generous
with it.

15:46.075 --> 15:48.164
She shows up an hour after that.Stop.

15:48.208 --> 15:49.905
Do not do this to yourself.

15:49.949 --> 15:53.082
I think I should just stop
believing in fairy tales.

15:55.128 --> 15:59.132
And that breaks my heart
a little bit.

16:10.186 --> 16:11.753
Callen, Sam, you were right.

16:11.796 --> 16:13.233
I figured out which bank account
was being used

16:13.276 --> 16:15.322
to pay for Joel Simoni,
Tiffany's lawyer.

16:15.365 --> 16:17.324
And?

16:17.367 --> 16:19.717
And not only is the account
located in the Cayman Islands--

16:19.761 --> 16:22.372
which, let's be honest,
is already super sketch--

16:22.416 --> 16:25.288
but Simoni's fees were the
only activity on the account--

16:25.332 --> 16:26.376
wait for it--

16:26.420 --> 16:27.508
until today.

16:27.551 --> 16:29.205
What happened today?

16:29.249 --> 16:31.033
Someone rented a car at LAX.

16:31.077 --> 16:32.513
If Phillip Robbins
is back in town,

16:32.556 --> 16:34.036
he's definitely up
to something.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.733
Yeah, he could be making
another move.

16:35.777 --> 16:37.561
He could also be coming
after Tiffany,

16:37.605 --> 16:39.781
especially if he figured out
that she's been helping us.

16:39.824 --> 16:42.305
The kind of people he knows,
he can get to her in jail.

16:42.349 --> 16:44.177
She's not safe
in there.

16:44.220 --> 16:45.221
So what are you guys gonna do?

16:45.265 --> 16:46.222
Bust her out of jail?

16:48.572 --> 16:50.183
That's not a bad idea.

16:50.226 --> 16:51.184
I've heard of worse.

16:51.227 --> 16:53.360
G... Guys, I'm-I'm kidding.

16:53.403 --> 16:55.101
I was kidding.

16:55.144 --> 16:56.363
Guys.

16:56.406 --> 16:58.408
I'm kidding.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.775
Callen, Sam.Just a couple of guys

17:17.819 --> 17:18.950
getting their
daily dose

17:18.994 --> 17:20.822
of vitamin D?We have a plan.

17:20.865 --> 17:22.041
Okay.
There's a very real
possibility

17:22.084 --> 17:24.173
that Phillip Robbins
is back in L.A.

17:25.609 --> 17:27.089
Tiffany Williams
isn't safe in jail.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.396
Wow, you couldn't have led
with the good news?

17:29.439 --> 17:30.658
Well, like I said,
we have a plan.

17:30.701 --> 17:31.876
Yeah, so you've mentioned.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.748
We're gonna take over
Tiffany's legal case.

17:33.791 --> 17:36.098
Wow, I don't know
how to tell you this,

17:36.142 --> 17:38.753
but I think that your plan
needs a little more planning.

17:38.796 --> 17:40.494
Her lawyer's a hack.
And you're...

17:40.537 --> 17:42.757
You're less of a hack. You could
argue circles around that guy.

17:44.411 --> 17:45.716
Okay,

17:45.760 --> 17:47.283
your big plan to get
Tiffany out of jail, it...

17:47.327 --> 17:48.676
No, guys, he can't defend her.

17:48.719 --> 17:51.157
He's LAPD.Guys, I've testified
in front

17:51.200 --> 17:52.419
of Judge Lee as a cop.

17:52.462 --> 17:55.248
I've argued cases to her
as a public defender.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.032
Which is why you
won't be her lawyer.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.861
Well, strictly speaking.
I will be.

17:59.904 --> 18:01.080
With you

18:01.123 --> 18:02.733
in my ear.
KENSI:
No, he can't.

18:02.777 --> 18:04.126
Is that even legal?Uh, it's definitely not legal.

18:04.170 --> 18:05.780
It's legal

18:05.823 --> 18:07.303
'Cause I'm pretty sure
that doesn't count.Mm-hmm.

18:07.347 --> 18:09.088
It's never stopped us before.

18:09.131 --> 18:10.741
We weren't being subpoenaed
before.
DEEKS:
What does Kilbride

18:10.785 --> 18:12.221
say about all this?
SAM:
Well, that's
the best part.

18:12.265 --> 18:13.788
Kilbride's not around.

18:13.831 --> 18:15.529
Which means we have
no protection.

18:15.572 --> 18:17.531
Well, I know that Hetty
would bless this op.Even if she does,

18:17.574 --> 18:19.141
what about Mosley?Don't have to worry
about Mosley.

18:19.185 --> 18:21.012
She's loyal.Maybe.

18:23.928 --> 18:24.886
What do youthink?

18:24.929 --> 18:27.193
What do I think?

18:27.236 --> 18:29.369
I think I'll be in the boatshed.

18:29.412 --> 18:31.110
Prepping for court.

18:36.506 --> 18:38.291
There you are.

18:39.292 --> 18:40.510
Nell, I need a favor.

18:40.554 --> 18:42.773
Mm. You're good.

18:42.817 --> 18:45.036
Everything's been arranged.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.125
For what?

18:46.168 --> 18:47.996
Your cover.

18:48.039 --> 18:49.780
But I never told
you what it was.

18:49.824 --> 18:51.826
I know. I figured it out.

18:51.869 --> 18:53.262
The way I see it,
there's only

18:53.306 --> 18:55.308
one legal-adjacent play
to get Tiffany out of jail.

18:55.351 --> 18:56.483
And you figured it out?

18:56.526 --> 18:57.614
I've been backstopping you

18:57.658 --> 18:59.094
as a criminal defense lawyer
all morning.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.400
Mm.

19:00.443 --> 19:03.142
Well, that is
some Jedi-level playbook stuff

19:03.185 --> 19:05.056
you got there, Nell.You know what they say.

19:05.100 --> 19:06.188
Big bangs, big brain.

19:06.232 --> 19:07.189
Yeah.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.409
Like that.Check it out.

19:09.452 --> 19:11.019
Logan O'Neill, huh?

19:11.062 --> 19:13.413
So I am now officially a member
of the California Bar?

19:13.456 --> 19:14.414
At least your alias is.

19:14.457 --> 19:15.676
What?

19:15.719 --> 19:18.026
You're not the only one
Hetty's been grooming.

19:18.069 --> 19:19.854
Promise,
you're good.

19:19.897 --> 19:20.855
Thank you.

19:20.898 --> 19:22.204
You're welcome.

19:22.248 --> 19:25.076
Oh, and, uh,
good luck out there.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.122
I hear the judge
is a real tough cookie.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.385
Good to know.

19:31.082 --> 19:33.389
Guys, that Cayman account
that paid for Tiffany's lawyer

19:33.433 --> 19:35.217
and the rented car from
LAX just popped up again

19:35.261 --> 19:37.437
at a spin studio in Hollywood.

19:37.480 --> 19:38.438
You and me.

19:38.481 --> 19:39.917
You and me, baby.
We a team.

19:50.537 --> 19:52.408
Think Phillips
is in there?

19:52.452 --> 19:54.758
I don't know. He's been
off the grid for months.

19:54.802 --> 19:56.543
Just got back to town,
the first thing he does

19:56.586 --> 19:59.546
is sign up for
a hard

19:59.589 --> 20:01.069
Yeah. Yeah.Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

20:01.112 --> 20:02.897
This is L.A., right?When in Rome.

20:03.941 --> 20:06.901
♪

20:06.944 --> 20:08.250
CASSIDY:
You guys,

20:08.294 --> 20:09.512
welcome to Cyclehaus!

20:09.556 --> 20:11.253
Are you signed up
for the next class,

20:11.297 --> 20:12.733
or do you want to join
the wait list?

20:12.776 --> 20:14.256
Oh, there's a wait list?Oh, yeah.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.084
Big-time.
I mean, Janet's teaching.

20:16.127 --> 20:18.042
Of course. Janet.
Janet, yeah.Janet's teaching.

20:18.086 --> 20:19.957
Yeah, no, sorry.
We were here this morning,

20:20.001 --> 20:21.568
and...Oh, you're back for a double?

20:21.611 --> 20:23.004
Well...
What?! Oh, you guys,

20:23.047 --> 20:24.353
they're back for a double!Oh, whoa.

20:24.397 --> 20:25.267
SAM:
No, please.

20:25.311 --> 20:26.268
Double!

20:26.312 --> 20:27.269
Can you put
that down, please?

20:27.313 --> 20:28.531
Just put down the bell.

20:28.575 --> 20:29.489
Please.Please put the bell down.

20:29.532 --> 20:30.968
No, I just left
my water bottle

20:31.012 --> 20:32.796
in the studio, and I was
wondering if I could go grab it.

20:32.840 --> 20:35.451
Yeah. I'll let you know
when the studio's open.Thank you.

20:35.495 --> 20:37.148
Let me know
if you change your mind.We won't.

20:37.192 --> 20:38.324
We won't.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.413
KENSI:
Thanks.

20:40.456 --> 20:42.676
Thank you.Thank you.

20:42.719 --> 20:44.417
This place counts
as a two

20:44.460 --> 20:45.809
Yeah, this place
will kick your butt.

20:45.853 --> 20:47.985
Really?

20:48.029 --> 20:49.813
Is that Phillip

20:49.857 --> 20:51.162
standing right up there?

20:51.206 --> 20:53.252
That's him, all right.

20:53.295 --> 20:55.166
Who's he with?
Have we seen her before?

20:55.210 --> 20:56.559
No.

20:56.603 --> 20:58.300
I don't think she's involved
with the case.

20:58.344 --> 20:59.301
You guys, the studio's open!

21:01.738 --> 21:03.479
At least not yet.Federal agents.

21:03.523 --> 21:05.089
Move!I'm-a go around back.

21:05.133 --> 21:06.265
KENSI:
Move. Get out of the way.

21:06.308 --> 21:08.310
Move.

21:08.354 --> 21:09.920
Get out of the way.

21:20.322 --> 21:22.324
Sam.Any luck?

21:22.368 --> 21:24.108
They're gone.

21:25.762 --> 21:27.503
At least we know
he's really back.

21:27.547 --> 21:29.244
And we have a picture of her.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.376
ERIC:
Our mystery woman

21:30.419 --> 21:32.291
from the spin studio

21:32.334 --> 21:34.031
is Vanessa Brown, former LAPD.

21:34.075 --> 21:36.251
Now works at Vivid
Locke Security.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.732
New security outfit
down in Playa.ERIC: Exactly.

21:38.775 --> 21:41.256
They won a huge government
contract earlier this year

21:41.300 --> 21:42.779
to develop the next generation

21:42.823 --> 21:44.564
of antiballistic
missile software.

21:44.607 --> 21:46.522
Vivid Locke could be
Phillip Robbins' next target.

21:46.566 --> 21:49.133
NELL: The company's run by
former Mossad. It's financed

21:49.177 --> 21:50.613
by former MI6.

21:50.657 --> 21:53.355
It's staffed
by former Rangers, SEALs...

21:53.399 --> 21:54.965
Apparently LAPD.

21:55.009 --> 21:56.793
You know her, Deeks?

21:56.837 --> 21:58.186
DEEKS: Never seen her
before in my life.

21:58.229 --> 21:59.405
NELL: That's because
Brown joined the force

21:59.448 --> 22:00.841
after you had already started
working here.

22:00.884 --> 22:02.364
How long did she last at LAPD?

22:02.408 --> 22:03.452
Less than five years.

22:03.496 --> 22:05.672
I bet there's a story there.

22:05.715 --> 22:08.109
Probably a good one.

22:08.152 --> 22:10.154
All right, I'm on it.

22:15.899 --> 22:17.684
Thank you.

22:19.250 --> 22:22.776
We have to stop running
into each other like this.

22:22.819 --> 22:24.212
No kidding.

22:26.257 --> 22:27.781
Chin up, Deeks.

22:27.824 --> 22:29.391
I got you a snow cone.

22:29.435 --> 22:32.351
That's incredibly thoughtful
of you. You mind, uh,

22:32.394 --> 22:34.483
holding that for me?
So, you recognize her?

22:34.527 --> 22:36.180
Where did you get that?

22:36.224 --> 22:38.400
Go ahead
and take that as a yes.

22:38.444 --> 22:41.055
So, why did Vanessa Brown
leave LAPD?

22:41.098 --> 22:43.797
That's not public information.Well, the guy
that we're going after

22:43.840 --> 22:45.625
and the guy that we think
set up Tiffany Williams

22:45.668 --> 22:47.235
and the reason
she's in prison again

22:47.278 --> 22:48.584
is in that picture with her.

22:48.628 --> 22:50.064
And who is he?

22:50.107 --> 22:52.414
Phillip Robbins.
He has the amazing tendency

22:52.458 --> 22:53.937
of taking things
from our country

22:53.981 --> 22:56.026
and selling it to our enemies.

22:56.070 --> 22:58.289
So, why did Vanessa Brown
leave LAPD?Do you want me to repeat

22:58.333 --> 22:59.856
what I already told you?

22:59.900 --> 23:01.728
That's okay. Let me just take
a stab in the dark, then.

23:01.771 --> 23:03.947
Was she stealing drugs
from the evidence locker?

23:03.991 --> 23:05.427
Drugs she could plant
on Tiffany Williams

23:05.471 --> 23:06.994
the night that she was arrested?

23:07.037 --> 23:09.344
And let me ask another question
while we're on the subject.

23:09.388 --> 23:12.608
How close was Vanessa Brown with
Young, Lopez, and Demblowski,

23:12.652 --> 23:14.958
the three officers
that arrested Tiffany last night

23:15.002 --> 23:16.525
on that phony
solicitation charge?

23:18.222 --> 23:20.181
Just eat your damn snow cone.

23:20.224 --> 23:21.791
That's so funny.

23:21.835 --> 23:24.054
That's the same thing I said
when I started using my brain.

23:25.491 --> 23:26.883
WOMAN:
Williams!

23:32.889 --> 23:34.891
Gate.

23:38.025 --> 23:40.027
Move.

23:48.122 --> 23:48.992
It's okay. It's me.

23:49.036 --> 23:50.907
Kensi. Geez, that was dramatic.

23:50.951 --> 23:52.343
How you doing

23:52.387 --> 23:54.998
It's all relative, right?
But let's be serious.

23:55.042 --> 23:56.957
I mean, this is...
this is pretty bad.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.219
Yeah, I know.
That's why we're trying

23:58.262 --> 23:59.350
to get you out of here
as soon as possible.

23:59.394 --> 24:01.048
How? This is literally a prison.

24:01.091 --> 24:02.789
For one,
we're getting you new counsel.

24:02.832 --> 24:05.139
Kensi, that is not a good idea.

24:05.182 --> 24:07.315
We know Phillip is paying
for your current lawyer.

24:07.358 --> 24:09.143
It's complicated.

24:09.186 --> 24:11.058
Tiffany, why is
it so complicated?

24:11.101 --> 24:13.147
Because he planted the cocaine
and set you up,

24:13.190 --> 24:14.801
or because he hired a guy
that's throwing the case?

24:14.844 --> 24:17.151
Or is there something else
you're not telling us?

24:17.194 --> 24:18.369
Four months ago,

24:18.413 --> 24:19.675
when you got arrested,

24:19.719 --> 24:22.199
where did you go
the night before the bar?

24:22.243 --> 24:23.723
I wish I could tell you.

24:23.766 --> 24:25.028
But I didn't do anything wrong,

24:25.072 --> 24:26.726
I swear, okay?
You just have to trust me.

24:27.770 --> 24:29.859
Okay. I believe you.

24:29.903 --> 24:31.861
Thank you.

24:31.905 --> 24:35.038
So, uh, who's my new lawyer?

24:37.693 --> 24:39.652
Deeks will be taking over
the case.

24:39.695 --> 24:41.567
Deeks?Mm-hmm.

24:41.610 --> 24:42.829
Is that even legal?

24:42.872 --> 24:45.005
Legal-adjacent, apparently.

24:45.048 --> 24:47.181
It's more of a Callen-Deeks
joint task force.

24:47.224 --> 24:51.054
Oh, Phillip is not
going to be happy.

24:51.098 --> 24:53.187
Good.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.059
Something we can use.

25:11.074 --> 25:13.599
Excuse me. Excuse me.

25:14.425 --> 25:16.558
Dude, I got to be in
court in ten minutes.

25:16.602 --> 25:18.255
This won't take long.
You're fired.

25:18.299 --> 25:19.996
What?You heard me.

25:21.824 --> 25:24.610
Get out of my way, man.Tiffany Williams
is no longer your client.

25:24.653 --> 25:26.481
She signed the release papers
this morning.

25:26.525 --> 25:27.961
And you're calling
the shots now?I am.

25:28.004 --> 25:30.093
And I'm gonna strongly suggest

25:30.137 --> 25:32.139
that you walk away
without a fight.

25:32.182 --> 25:33.749
Or else?

25:33.793 --> 25:35.055
I'll have you disbarred.

25:35.098 --> 25:36.752
Probably sue you
for malpractice.

25:36.796 --> 25:37.884
Now, that would be my pleasure.

25:37.927 --> 25:40.060
Oh, and if you have
any other problems,

25:40.103 --> 25:41.452
why don't you just have
whoever's paying your bills

25:41.496 --> 25:43.803
give me a call?

25:43.846 --> 25:45.848
Have a good day.

25:51.637 --> 25:53.029
It's not enough.

25:53.073 --> 25:55.118
Either that or it's too much.

25:55.162 --> 25:57.077
It's not enough
of what we need.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.166
If we're gonna infiltrate
Vivid Locke Security

25:59.209 --> 26:02.082
and secure the software before
Phillip Robbins gets to it,

26:02.125 --> 26:04.998
we're gonna need to outthink,
outcode, outmaneuver

26:05.041 --> 26:06.565
the equivalent
of three intelligence agencies.

26:06.608 --> 26:08.131
ERIC:
Their security system

26:08.175 --> 26:10.481

26:10.525 --> 26:11.874
Look at that building.

26:11.918 --> 26:13.789
It's like a block-wide
panic room.

26:13.833 --> 26:15.356
We can't compete
with that man power.

26:16.531 --> 26:18.098
And we're running
out of time.

26:18.141 --> 26:20.100
Now, remind me again
how Phillip Robbins

26:20.143 --> 26:22.493
is gonna steal their software?SAM:
Vanessa Brown.

26:22.537 --> 26:23.930
He's got a corrupt cop
on the inside.

26:23.973 --> 26:25.801
That old chestnut. Wait.

26:25.845 --> 26:28.325
So, then, why don't we just...Because we don't know
who we can trust.

26:28.369 --> 26:30.066
Vanessa Brown might have
a whole team of people

26:30.110 --> 26:32.025
working with her; we don't want
to tip any of them off.

26:32.068 --> 26:33.200
ERIC: Besides, this
is the kind of place

26:33.243 --> 26:34.636
where, if the HVAC goes down,

26:34.680 --> 26:36.333
they fix it themselves.
If the power goes down,

26:36.377 --> 26:37.987
they fix it themselves.

26:38.031 --> 26:39.685
It's like Survivor

26:39.728 --> 26:41.121
That would be a terrible show.Unwatchable.

SAM: Hmm.What do you see?

26:42.383 --> 26:44.167
There.

26:44.211 --> 26:46.082
Our own thermal exhaust port.

26:47.780 --> 26:49.782
You think you
can pull it off?

It'd be complicated.

KENSI:
And dangerous.

Extremely expensive.SAM:
But it would work.

No matter. We're here,

27:16.025 --> 27:18.071
and either way,
I'm missing lunch.

27:18.114 --> 27:19.376
Defendant,

27:19.420 --> 27:21.204
do you consent to new counsel?Yes, Your Honor.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.035
Well?Right. Your Honor,

27:26.079 --> 27:27.646
I'm here to ask

27:27.689 --> 27:29.169
that my client be
allowed to post bail

27:29.212 --> 27:30.431
for the duration of trial.

27:30.474 --> 27:32.694
That's the emergency?
I'm confused.

27:32.738 --> 27:35.871
Am I having déjà vu?
Didn't I already rule on this?

27:35.915 --> 27:37.351
Your Honor, it
has come to light

27:37.394 --> 27:39.962
that my client's life may be
in danger were she to remain

27:40.006 --> 27:41.703
in jail.

27:41.747 --> 27:42.878
And?

27:42.922 --> 27:44.706
And?

27:44.750 --> 27:46.273
And?

27:47.056 --> 27:50.190
And, more important,

27:50.233 --> 27:52.714
the motion

27:52.758 --> 27:54.716
that my client's
previous counsel

27:54.760 --> 27:56.109
submitted to the clerk

27:56.152 --> 27:59.895
in regards to
the new solicitation charges...

27:59.939 --> 28:01.157
was inadequate.

28:01.201 --> 28:02.985
Scratch that.

28:03.029 --> 28:04.595
It was egregiously
inadequate.

28:04.639 --> 28:06.380
You got to be kidding me.

28:06.423 --> 28:08.687
Your Honor,
you said so yourself.

28:08.730 --> 28:11.037
You already ruled on the motion.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.168
And I'm not allowed
to change my mind?

28:12.212 --> 28:13.866
I have eyewitness accounts,

28:13.909 --> 28:17.173
security camera footage as
well as credit card receipts

28:17.217 --> 28:20.263
that prove that my client
on the night and the hour

28:20.307 --> 28:22.222
of the alleged solicitation

28:22.265 --> 28:24.050
was, in fact,

28:24.093 --> 28:26.269
having dinner with friends
in North Hollywood.

28:26.313 --> 28:30.056
So I ask, is it likely
that Tiffany Williams

28:30.099 --> 28:32.885
was in violation of her bail?

28:32.928 --> 28:34.408
Unless she discovered
the fifth dimension

28:34.451 --> 28:36.236
in the space-time continuum,

28:36.279 --> 28:37.237
I would argue not.

28:37.280 --> 28:38.673
I'd argue not.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.722
All right, then.

28:45.680 --> 28:47.029
Looks like you've
got yourself

28:47.073 --> 28:48.248
a fair fight.

28:49.205 --> 28:50.990
DEEKS:
Boom! Good work, Callen.

28:51.033 --> 28:53.470
That a boy.

29:03.002 --> 29:05.221
Do you want to go over
the op one more time?

29:09.269 --> 29:12.881
Okay, look, my only concern are
the blades on the exhaust fan.

29:12.925 --> 29:14.970
The timing has to be perfect,

29:15.014 --> 29:15.971
or we're dead.

29:16.015 --> 29:18.757
Or... you're dead.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.672
Kensi.

29:21.716 --> 29:24.371
You good?Yeah.

29:24.414 --> 29:26.025
Sorry, I'm just...

29:26.068 --> 29:27.983
I'm just thinking
about Tiffany.

29:28.027 --> 29:30.072
She's definitely not
telling us something.

29:30.116 --> 29:32.031
Yeah, I just wish I knew why.

29:32.074 --> 29:34.816
Callen and Deeks
are taking care of her.

29:34.860 --> 29:38.080
Me and you? Our only job

29:38.124 --> 29:39.516
is to stay ahead
of Phillip Robbins

29:39.560 --> 29:41.040
and make sure
Vivid Locke Security technology

29:41.083 --> 29:44.217
doesn't end up in
the wrong hands.

29:50.527 --> 29:52.051
ADA Lopez.

29:52.094 --> 29:54.401
Mr. O'Neill.You see how easy that was?

29:54.444 --> 29:56.185
This is gonna be so much fun.Oh.

29:56.229 --> 29:58.013
You mean that performance art
back there?

29:58.057 --> 29:59.101
Mm.
That was

29:59.145 --> 30:00.755
the definition
of beginner's luck.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.235
You sure you want to risk that?

30:02.278 --> 30:04.150
I mean, it might dilute
your conviction record.

30:04.193 --> 30:06.326
Not gonna look good
when you run for office.

30:06.369 --> 30:08.719
That has nothing to do

30:08.763 --> 30:11.244
with why I'm prepared
to offer your client a deal.

30:11.287 --> 30:13.246
Not interested.Shouldn't we hear
what it is first?

30:13.289 --> 30:16.597
I think you should listen
to your client on this one.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.817
It won't be on the table
for long.

30:18.860 --> 30:20.035
My client is not
gonna plead guilty

30:20.079 --> 30:21.558
for a crime she
did not commit.

30:21.602 --> 30:23.386
Then get ready for round two.

30:23.430 --> 30:25.432
I won't be pulling punches.

30:26.520 --> 30:28.217
:
What did you just do?

30:28.261 --> 30:29.871
I can't go
back to jail.

30:29.915 --> 30:31.612
You are gonna have to trust me.

30:31.655 --> 30:33.570
Just like
we are all trusting you.

30:46.670 --> 30:48.672
Huh.

30:55.375 --> 30:56.332
Detective Whiting.

30:56.376 --> 30:57.768
Whiting, hey...

30:57.812 --> 30:59.770
This better be good.
I'm on my lunch. Who is this?

30:59.814 --> 31:01.076
Yeah, it's Deeks.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.470
Listen, I need your help
to make something right.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.086
KENSI:
Eric, we're pulling up
to Vivid Locke Security.

31:11.130 --> 31:12.435
Something's going down.

31:12.479 --> 31:13.915
ERIC:
Yeah, their in-house alarm
went off.

31:13.959 --> 31:15.917
There was an armed robbery.

31:15.961 --> 31:17.397
Looks like Phillip Robbins
beat you to it.

31:17.440 --> 31:18.702
Sorry, folks,
but you have to go.

31:18.746 --> 31:20.139
We may be too late.

31:20.182 --> 31:22.924
OFFICER:
Go, let's move,
everybody to this side.

31:27.102 --> 31:28.625
Now what?

31:43.336 --> 31:45.338
DEEKS:
Yeah, great.

31:45.381 --> 31:46.948
Thanks.

31:46.992 --> 31:48.819
How we doing?

31:48.863 --> 31:50.691
Phillip Robbins got away
with Vivid Locke's

31:50.734 --> 31:52.388
antiballistic missile technology
before

31:52.432 --> 31:53.999
Kensi and Sam even got there.
It looks like

31:54.042 --> 31:56.740
Vanessa Brown was helping him,
but on the bright side,

31:56.784 --> 31:59.265
it appears
our instincts were spot

31:59.308 --> 32:00.831
They're working on it.
Okay.

32:00.875 --> 32:02.877
All we have to do is recover
the stolen technology

32:02.921 --> 32:04.879
before Robbins has a chance
to sell it to our enemies.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.315
Well, yeah, that

32:06.359 --> 32:08.056
and convince the ADA
to drop charges against Tiffany.

32:08.100 --> 32:09.928
That would help, too.

32:09.971 --> 32:11.755
It's official.

32:11.799 --> 32:13.888
It's Manic Monday.

32:16.282 --> 32:18.371
KENSI:
This does not look
like a fortress to me.

32:18.414 --> 32:19.415
SAM:
That's by design.

32:19.459 --> 32:21.374
But it does have
an Achilles' heel,

32:21.417 --> 32:22.592
and Phillip Robbins found it.

32:23.637 --> 32:25.291
The people that work here.

32:25.334 --> 32:27.293
We may start off
pure and innocent,

32:27.336 --> 32:29.164
but all humans
are corruptible.

32:29.208 --> 32:30.513
Are you talking about Tiffany?

32:30.557 --> 32:31.906
No, but it applies to her, too.

32:34.039 --> 32:35.301
What's up, Eric?

32:35.344 --> 32:37.259
I just got a hit
on Phillip Robbins' rental car.

32:37.303 --> 32:38.652
He's heading west
on Santa Monica Boulevard,

32:38.695 --> 32:39.958
just past Bundy.

32:40.001 --> 32:41.437
SAM:
That's a mile
from the courthouse.

32:41.481 --> 32:44.397
I'll call Callen.

32:44.440 --> 32:46.007
Excuse me.Excuse me.

32:51.273 --> 32:52.753
Detective Whiting.

32:52.796 --> 32:54.929
We good?
I'm here, aren't I?

32:54.973 --> 32:56.844
That's about as warm
and fuzzy as she gets.

32:56.887 --> 32:57.888
We're good.

32:57.932 --> 32:58.889
Tiffany, stay here.

32:58.933 --> 32:59.934
It's okay.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.936
Is that Eric?I'll call him back.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.590
Sorry, not sorry.
The offer's

33:03.633 --> 33:05.331
no long on the table,
Mr. O'Neill.

33:05.374 --> 33:06.810
You should have listened
to your client.

33:08.116 --> 33:10.901
Well, I'm still not
interested in a deal, but

33:10.945 --> 33:12.816
I would like you
to drop the charges

33:12.860 --> 33:14.427
against Tiffany Williams.

33:14.470 --> 33:16.255
Why?

33:16.298 --> 33:18.605
Because you seem like
such a stand

33:19.475 --> 33:22.870
ADA Lopez, trust me. You don't
want to be anywhere near this.

33:22.913 --> 33:24.698
And you are?

33:24.741 --> 33:27.701
LAPD Detective Ellen Whiting,
Internal Affairs.

33:27.744 --> 33:30.530
Someone's been naughty,
it's true, but

33:30.573 --> 33:31.705
you're going after
the wrong girl.

33:31.748 --> 33:34.012
I see.

33:34.055 --> 33:36.231
Well, I'll have to speak
with the district attorney...

33:36.275 --> 33:39.321
We both know that's not true.And who are you?

33:39.365 --> 33:40.496
Somebody who knows
what they're talking about.

33:40.540 --> 33:42.194
Listen, let's
break this down together.

33:42.237 --> 33:43.978
You have a detective
from Internal Affairs

33:44.022 --> 33:45.501
that says this case
is rotten. Therefore,

33:45.545 --> 33:47.895
there is no scenario
in which this goes to trial.

33:47.938 --> 33:49.723
So you have a pretty easy
decision in front of you.

33:49.766 --> 33:51.203
Do you continue
to play God

33:51.246 --> 33:53.596
with an innocent woman's life
for a few more days, or

33:53.640 --> 33:56.860
do you act like a decent human
being and drop the charges?

33:58.645 --> 34:01.213
I'll go speak to the clerk.

34:05.608 --> 34:07.654
Thank you.You don't have
to thank me.

34:07.697 --> 34:09.569
I didn't do squat for you.

34:09.612 --> 34:11.571
Guys, we got company.

34:11.614 --> 34:12.876
Phillip Robbins
and Vanessa Brown.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.095
Oh, God.

34:14.139 --> 34:15.270
Tiffany?

34:16.619 --> 34:18.621
I got 'em.

34:18.665 --> 34:20.580
Go, go, go.

34:21.885 --> 34:24.192
Phillip Robbins.

34:25.237 --> 34:26.760
Where is she?

34:26.803 --> 34:28.979
Where is the missile software?

34:29.023 --> 34:30.894
You trade her for that?

34:30.938 --> 34:33.027
Well, I really like
that software.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.159
How much do you care
about the girl?

34:41.731 --> 34:42.906
Go, go, go.

34:42.950 --> 34:44.691
No, ho-ho-ho-ho...

34:44.734 --> 34:46.040
Hold on. Hold on.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.477
It's okay.
Hold on.

34:48.521 --> 34:51.219
I dare you.

34:56.006 --> 34:57.007
Let's go.

34:57.834 --> 34:59.140
Move it.

34:59.184 --> 35:00.533
Good work.

35:02.404 --> 35:04.276
You okay?

35:04.319 --> 35:07.148
Okay, let's go. Come on.

35:07.192 --> 35:08.889
So, why do you care
so much about Tiffany?

35:08.932 --> 35:10.151
Who is she?

35:10.195 --> 35:12.762
Someone I trusted.
Ah.

35:12.806 --> 35:14.764
She lied to you, huh?

35:14.808 --> 35:16.766
Isn't that what
you pay her for?

35:16.810 --> 35:19.291
She betrayed me.

35:19.334 --> 35:21.162
Well, now, that would be
upsetting to me as well.

35:21.206 --> 35:22.381
Where is she?

35:29.823 --> 35:32.173
All right, it's okay.Who are those guys?!

35:33.653 --> 35:35.089
It's probably the team
Robbins had working with him

35:35.133 --> 35:37.744
inside of Vivid Locke Security.Vivid Locke Security?

35:37.787 --> 35:39.398
That's the case you
helped us solve.

35:45.621 --> 35:48.407
Aah!
Oh, my God, Deeks,
I can't do this, I can't do it.

35:48.450 --> 35:49.930
I can't do it. I can't do it.Look at me. Look at me.

35:49.973 --> 35:51.801
Look at me, Tiffany.
Look at me. You can do this.

35:51.845 --> 35:53.629
Look at me. You're fine.
You're okay. I'm gonna
get you through this.

35:58.895 --> 36:00.419
Behind us!

36:01.898 --> 36:03.117
Stay down.

36:13.562 --> 36:15.564
It's okay.

36:15.608 --> 36:16.609
Hey, you're okay.

36:16.652 --> 36:18.350
Look at me.

36:18.393 --> 36:20.308
It's over.

36:20.352 --> 36:21.657
All right?

36:21.701 --> 36:23.442
It's over.
You did good.

36:23.485 --> 36:25.270
Federal agent!
Federal agent!

36:25.313 --> 36:27.054
OFFICER:
Move, move.Seriously?

36:27.097 --> 36:28.664
What took you so long?

36:28.708 --> 36:31.319
You're hilarious.It's okay.
You can say it.

36:31.363 --> 36:32.886
You missed me, Sam.

36:36.977 --> 36:38.935
Let's move it.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.592
So, Phillip framed Tiffany when
he suspected she'd betrayed him.

36:43.636 --> 36:45.028
KENSI:
Well, he also

36:45.072 --> 36:46.813
killed two birds with one stone
with Vanessa Brown.

36:46.856 --> 36:48.684
Not only did she help him
arrest Tiffany,

36:48.728 --> 36:51.252
but he also got his hands
on that antiballistic software.

36:51.296 --> 36:53.602
Which we still
haven't recovered.CALLEN: We'll pit Phillip

36:53.646 --> 36:55.735
against Vanessa, see which one
of them caves first.

36:55.778 --> 36:57.258
And inevitably one of them will.

36:57.302 --> 36:58.259
Mm-hmm.

37:00.827 --> 37:03.438
Excuse me for a
second, gentlemen.

37:12.099 --> 37:14.057
DEEKS:
Hey.

37:14.101 --> 37:16.059
Hey.

37:16.103 --> 37:18.627
You doing okay?

37:18.671 --> 37:20.760
Yeah. I'm just
waiting for my mom.

37:20.803 --> 37:22.283
We could have
dropped you off.

37:22.327 --> 37:24.372
No, that's okay.
Kind of just wanted

37:24.416 --> 37:28.463
to spend some time with her,
but thank you, Deeks,

37:28.507 --> 37:30.857
for everything.

37:30.900 --> 37:32.206
Well, I owe you an apology.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.686
I never should have put
you in that position.

37:33.729 --> 37:35.601
I'm the one who said yes.

37:35.644 --> 37:37.951
Doesn't matter. I shouldn't
have asked, and I'm sorry.

37:37.994 --> 37:39.605
Well, thank you
for believing me.

37:39.648 --> 37:41.998
Even when I couldn't
totally be honest with you.

37:42.042 --> 37:44.000
Listen, I get it, you know?

37:44.044 --> 37:45.567
Phillip's a scary guy,

37:45.611 --> 37:49.223
especially when he's got one
of your friends in his teeth.

37:50.485 --> 37:51.834
You knew?

37:51.878 --> 37:53.706
Not until today.

37:53.749 --> 37:56.317
And I could never
figure out why,

37:56.361 --> 37:58.798
when you showed up at the
bar, you were crying,
and then I realized

37:58.841 --> 38:00.756
it's just 'cause you were
protecting somebody.

38:00.800 --> 38:03.716
Right? Somebody that
wasn't able to get out.

38:03.759 --> 38:06.284
So I tracked
down your crew,

38:06.327 --> 38:09.243
and they told me what
happened to Lorraine.

38:13.465 --> 38:16.294
Back then, Lorraine was
like a sister to me.

38:17.382 --> 38:19.819
Phillip went after her
to hurt me,

38:19.862 --> 38:21.734
and she needed
my help that night.

38:21.777 --> 38:24.345
Really, she needed a hospital,

38:24.389 --> 38:26.826
but I promised her
that I wouldn't tell anyone.

38:30.003 --> 38:33.528
We thought that Phillip was
gonna come back to kill her.

38:33.572 --> 38:35.530
Kill us both.

38:35.574 --> 38:38.403
Well, the great news is,
he can never touch her again.

38:39.926 --> 38:41.667
He's not gonna hurt
anybody again.

38:41.710 --> 38:43.625
And that's because of you.

38:43.669 --> 38:45.192
Yeah?

38:45.235 --> 38:47.499
You did good.

38:49.501 --> 38:52.634
Hi, honey.Hey.

38:52.678 --> 38:54.419
Ready?Yeah.

38:56.943 --> 38:58.945
Good-bye, Deeks.

39:00.381 --> 39:01.904
Be safe, okay?Mm-hmm.

39:03.602 --> 39:06.039
Hi, Mama.

39:08.433 --> 39:10.565
You did good.

39:15.918 --> 39:17.398
Oi.
Oi.

39:17.442 --> 39:18.443
Oi.

39:20.488 --> 39:22.316
You okay?

39:22.360 --> 39:24.362
I'm good.

39:26.146 --> 39:27.974
I'm actually really good.

39:28.017 --> 39:29.149
Really good?

39:29.192 --> 39:31.151
Yeah. Today just reminded me

39:31.194 --> 39:33.153
what a truly exceptional
lawyer I am.

39:34.546 --> 39:36.504
Are you, now?

39:36.548 --> 39:38.376
And I think there's something
to be said...

39:38.419 --> 39:40.595
You know, I think
it's incredibly appealing

39:40.639 --> 39:43.859
to do something
to help people, you know,

39:43.903 --> 39:47.254
get a decent paycheck, and not
get shot at every single day.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.213
I'm sorry to
break it to you,

39:50.257 --> 39:53.956
but, um, you did
get shot at today.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.741
Touché.

39:57.873 --> 40:00.310
You're a good man, Martin Deeks.

40:00.354 --> 40:02.400
A very good one.

40:06.621 --> 40:08.710
As always.
Yup.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.410
