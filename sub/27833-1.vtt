Help!

01:29.219 --> 01:30.219
Help!

02:16.440 --> 02:17.920
Alright.

02:17.963 --> 02:19.704
How are you?

02:19.748 --> 02:20.748
Good.

02:23.882 --> 02:25.014
I'm so sorry, I'm so...

02:25.057 --> 02:26.339
I'm gonna be right
back dear, okay?

02:26.363 --> 02:28.104
So you're sorry?

02:28.148 --> 02:29.714
Nancy, Nancy.

02:29.758 --> 02:31.194
What did the, look at this!

02:31.238 --> 02:32.630
It looks like a squirrel's nest!

02:32.674 --> 02:34.066
I can see that, did you remember

02:34.110 --> 02:35.590
to condition before the blowout?

02:35.633 --> 02:36.373
I kinda maybe forgot that part.

02:36.417 --> 02:37.548
Okay, can you fix it?

02:37.592 --> 02:39.202
Absolutely.

02:39.246 --> 02:39.985
Nancy why don't you go take
care of my client, please?

02:40.029 --> 02:41.422
Thank you.

02:41.465 --> 02:43.032
I am so sorry Ms. Thompson.

02:43.075 --> 02:44.444
This will just take
me about 15 minutes.

02:44.468 --> 02:45.788
And of course your
cut, the color,

02:45.817 --> 02:47.341
and the blowout is
on me today, okay?

02:47.384 --> 02:48.255
Well, it better be.

02:48.298 --> 02:49.430
Yeah, absolutely.

02:49.473 --> 02:50.953
I'm just gonna grab
my product, okay?

02:50.996 --> 02:52.824
If you weren't my
best friend I would...

02:52.868 --> 02:53.868
I'm so sorry.

03:01.790 --> 03:03.705
Melanie, could you hold
my next appointment?

03:03.748 --> 03:04.358
I need to take
care of something.

03:04.401 --> 03:05.837
Thank you.

03:05.881 --> 03:06.708
Oh, this is a really good one.

03:06.751 --> 03:08.536
You're gonna love that, yes.

03:11.843 --> 03:13.193
Aren't you gonna say hi?

03:15.064 --> 03:16.064
- No.
- No?

03:17.240 --> 03:18.720
Why?

03:18.763 --> 03:20.176
Because I know what you
want and I cannot do it.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.940
I just want a quick haircut.

03:21.984 --> 03:23.986
That is not what
you really want.

03:24.029 --> 03:25.117
So what do I really want?

03:25.161 --> 03:26.902
You wanna go to lunch.

03:26.945 --> 03:29.034
Can't you see how
crazy busy I am?

03:29.078 --> 03:31.602
I can but we don't
have to go far.

03:31.646 --> 03:33.952
I'm supposed to
go fix something.

03:33.996 --> 03:35.998
They are gonna see, they're
gonna know we're here.

03:43.353 --> 03:45.616
I'm supposed to
be getting lunch.

03:45.660 --> 03:49.098
No, no, no, there are more
important things than lunch.

03:49.141 --> 03:52.188
- Get over here, now it's my turn.
- Okay.

04:07.682 --> 04:08.857
Tessa!

04:09.858 --> 04:11.207
You home?

04:11.251 --> 04:12.252
In the kitchen mom!

04:13.427 --> 04:14.906
Hey sweetheart!

04:14.950 --> 04:15.994
How was your day?

04:16.038 --> 04:17.909
- Calculus test.
- Crushed it!

04:17.952 --> 04:19.824
- That's my girl.
- Yeah.

04:22.566 --> 04:25.003
And Will asked me
to Fall Formal.

04:25.047 --> 04:26.396
Aww.

04:26.440 --> 04:29.312
Well, it's not like we
didn't see that coming.

04:29.356 --> 04:32.228
Well, one should never count
chickens before they hatch.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.404
You guys have been
dating since freshmen year.

04:34.448 --> 04:36.493
I think those chickens
have hatched sweetheart.

04:36.537 --> 04:39.279
For now but what
about next year?

04:39.322 --> 04:41.977
Just enjoy every
second of this time.

04:42.020 --> 04:44.066
And you only get these
moments once in life.

04:45.633 --> 04:46.633
Thanks mom.

04:48.810 --> 04:49.985
You should do the same.

04:50.028 --> 04:51.508
You know, this time next year,

04:51.552 --> 04:53.945
I'm gonna be at
some far off college

04:53.989 --> 04:56.054
unless you pull the trigger
and move in with Christian,

04:56.078 --> 04:59.560
it's just gonna be you
alone in this house.

04:59.603 --> 05:01.518
Oh, you had to go
there, didn't you?

05:02.911 --> 05:04.869
Your little girl all grown up

05:04.913 --> 05:06.784
thousands of miles away.

05:06.828 --> 05:07.872
I'll get a cat.

05:07.916 --> 05:09.744
- Hmm, no!
- I'll get lots of cats.

05:11.572 --> 05:13.008
Alright, go get ready.

05:13.051 --> 05:14.202
I told Nancy and Will
we'd meet 'em for dinner.

05:14.226 --> 05:15.226
Ah, okay.

05:20.363 --> 05:22.365
It was like
she'd been electrocuted.

05:22.409 --> 05:25.977
It was poofy and
only slightly poofy.

05:27.022 --> 05:28.371
Oh no.

05:28.415 --> 05:30.001
It looks like a bomb
went off on her head.

05:30.025 --> 05:31.305
Well that's what you get hiring

05:31.331 --> 05:33.115
your best friend
to work for you.

05:33.158 --> 05:35.160
Aww, I wouldn't
have it any other way.

05:35.204 --> 05:36.399
Oh please, I'm just glad working

05:36.423 --> 05:38.207
at the salon actually pays.

05:38.250 --> 05:40.818
Interning at this
law firm for nothing

05:40.862 --> 05:42.559
is literally gonna kill me.

05:42.603 --> 05:43.971
You're almost done
with law school, right?

05:43.995 --> 05:47.738
Oh, if two years is
almost done, then yes.

05:47.782 --> 05:50.698
Let's change the subject
to something less painful.

05:50.741 --> 05:53.875
Let's talk about Tessa
and Will's college plans.

05:53.918 --> 05:55.398
Anything but that.

05:55.442 --> 05:57.748
Oh tell auntie Nancy about
your scholarship, Will!

05:57.792 --> 05:59.881
Mom, you brag about him
like he's your own son.

05:59.924 --> 06:02.013
That's because I'm proud of him.

06:02.057 --> 06:03.319
It's nothing, really.

06:03.363 --> 06:06.409
A full scholarship
to VIT is not nothing.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.019
No way!

06:08.063 --> 06:09.151
How did you pull that off?

06:09.194 --> 06:10.587
Because he's brilliant?

06:10.631 --> 06:12.546
And Tessa is on the
wait list temporarily

06:12.589 --> 06:14.001
with no doubt that
she's gonna get it.

06:14.025 --> 06:15.375
Aww, honey that's amazing.

06:15.418 --> 06:16.656
So you have nothing
to worry about.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.040
You're gonna be at
the same school.

06:18.073 --> 06:19.311
Yeah, all the stressing about

06:19.335 --> 06:20.945
a long distance
relationship for nothing.

06:20.989 --> 06:22.425
Hopefully!

06:22.469 --> 06:24.471
Okay, well I think that
this deserves a toast.

06:24.514 --> 06:28.910
Yes, to Tessa and Will and VIT.

06:28.953 --> 06:32.087
Oh, and to your
extremely successful salon.

06:32.130 --> 06:34.132
To your paying job auntie Nancy.

06:34.176 --> 06:35.830
Thank you.

06:35.873 --> 06:39.311
And to my mom who's the best
parent a kid could ask for.

06:39.355 --> 06:40.748
I know you sacrificed a lot

06:40.791 --> 06:42.837
to give me everything
that I need.

06:42.880 --> 06:43.968
I love you.

06:44.012 --> 06:45.317
I love you.

06:45.361 --> 06:46.101
And cheers!

06:46.144 --> 06:47.144
Cheers!

06:52.716 --> 06:55.066
I can put in some more
curls when I pin up your updo.

06:56.024 --> 06:57.224
I'm sorry, hold on one second.

06:58.374 --> 06:59.897
Hey Tessa.

06:59.941 --> 07:02.857
Oh sure, yeah hold on.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.467
Honey it's Tessa.

07:04.511 --> 07:05.836
She seems upset, she's
been trying to reach you.

07:05.860 --> 07:06.513
One second.

07:06.556 --> 07:07.905
Hi Tessa!

07:07.949 --> 07:09.124
What's up?

07:09.167 --> 07:10.255
Mom, can you come outside?

07:10.299 --> 07:11.256
Wait, you're here?

07:11.300 --> 07:12.649
Yeah.

07:12.693 --> 07:14.279
Well, Tessa can you
please just come inside

07:14.303 --> 07:16.000
'cause I'm finishing
up a client.

07:16.044 --> 07:19.264
- Mom, please.
- Alright, okay.

07:19.308 --> 07:20.962
Alright, hold on.

07:21.005 --> 07:22.180
- I got it.
- Okay, great.

07:22.224 --> 07:23.094
I'll be right back, okay?

07:23.138 --> 07:24.400
Thank you.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.964
I'll finish blow
drying you, sweetie.

07:33.496 --> 07:34.802
Tessa!

07:34.845 --> 07:36.281
Tessa, what is wrong?

07:36.325 --> 07:37.457
You are scaring me.

07:38.936 --> 07:39.936
Mom...

07:42.070 --> 07:43.463
I got in.

07:43.506 --> 07:45.029
I got into Vanderton!

07:45.073 --> 07:46.073
I got into VIT!

07:46.727 --> 07:47.510
What?

07:47.554 --> 07:48.511
You got into VIT?

07:48.555 --> 07:51.862
Oh my Gosh, that is so amazing!

07:51.906 --> 07:54.430
Okay mom, mom,
just chill, chill.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.910
No, this is not
the time to chill.

07:55.953 --> 07:57.868
This is the time to freak out!

07:59.783 --> 08:01.742
But seriously, how am
I gonna pay for this?

08:01.785 --> 08:03.134
You're gonna get scholarships

08:03.178 --> 08:04.590
and listen I'll sell
the salon if I have to.

08:04.614 --> 08:05.809
There is no way
we're letting money

08:05.833 --> 08:07.530
stop you from going to VIT.

08:07.574 --> 08:08.879
Mom!

08:08.923 --> 08:10.751
That's it, it's done,
you're going, okay?

08:10.794 --> 08:13.493
I want you to call Will, invite
him over for dinner tonight

08:13.536 --> 08:14.798
'cause we're gonna celebrate.

08:16.104 --> 08:18.062
I am so proud of you.

08:18.106 --> 08:19.499
So proud of you.

08:19.542 --> 08:20.717
Alright, let's go tell Nancy.

08:20.761 --> 08:21.805
Okay.

08:21.849 --> 08:23.981
I'm so excited for you, come on.

08:48.049 --> 08:50.051
This movie is a
little scary for me.

08:50.094 --> 08:51.094
I'm going to bed.

08:53.097 --> 08:54.597
- Goodnight Ms. Taylor.
- Goodnight mom.

08:54.621 --> 08:55.926
Goodnight.

08:55.970 --> 08:58.015
Will, will you lock the
door on your way out?

08:58.059 --> 08:59.408
And Tessa, don't forget

08:59.451 --> 09:00.017
- to turn off the lights.
- Turn off the lights.

09:00.061 --> 09:00.888
Got it.

09:00.931 --> 09:01.628
Thank you.

09:01.671 --> 09:02.759
Alright, goodnight.

09:26.217 --> 09:30.004
Oh my God.

09:30.047 --> 09:31.179
It's just a movie.

09:32.484 --> 09:33.790
These things actually happen.

09:35.052 --> 09:36.663
Not with me around, they don't.

09:58.249 --> 10:02.123
You made me miss
the end of the movie.

10:02.166 --> 10:03.406
Well you didn't seem to mind.

10:20.794 --> 10:24.449
Okay, we are not messing
around on my mom's sofa.

10:27.975 --> 10:28.975
What about the floor?

10:31.326 --> 10:32.762
Your bedroom?

10:32.806 --> 10:33.806
Will Radford, no!

10:35.025 --> 10:36.025
No, come on.

10:37.462 --> 10:38.462
Let's go.

10:39.900 --> 10:40.900
Okay.

10:44.382 --> 10:45.470
Get my jacket.

10:58.005 --> 10:59.702
Don't leave, no.

10:59.746 --> 11:00.877
I got to.

11:02.531 --> 11:03.750
See you tomorrow.

11:04.881 --> 11:09.756
Okay.

11:14.891 --> 11:15.891
Oh my keys.

11:58.935 --> 11:59.935
Sweetheart?

12:00.589 --> 12:01.982
Is everything okay?

12:02.025 --> 12:03.025
Yeah, why?

12:03.897 --> 12:05.289
Did Will go home?

12:05.333 --> 12:07.030
Yeah, he left a while ago.

12:08.945 --> 12:10.947
I thought I heard something.

12:10.991 --> 12:11.992
Alright, goodnight.

12:12.035 --> 12:13.035
Goodnight.

13:12.966 --> 13:13.836
Oh my God!

13:13.880 --> 13:14.880
Will, Will!

13:15.969 --> 13:17.405
Somebody help me!

13:19.059 --> 13:20.059
Will!

13:22.453 --> 13:23.453
Oh my God!

13:26.980 --> 13:27.894
Mom!

13:27.937 --> 13:28.937
Tessa call 911!

13:30.461 --> 13:31.461
Mom!

13:32.289 --> 13:33.638
Will.

13:33.682 --> 13:35.466
Tessa go back in the
house and call 911.

13:35.510 --> 13:36.598
Oh my God!

13:36.641 --> 13:37.641
Will!

13:38.339 --> 13:43.257
Help!

13:56.923 --> 13:58.098
Hey I, nevermind.

14:01.536 --> 14:02.536
Hi.

14:04.974 --> 14:07.542
So when can we see him?

14:07.585 --> 14:08.585
Tessa...

14:11.154 --> 14:13.853
I'm sorry, he's gone.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.119
Wait, what do you mean?

14:19.162 --> 14:21.121
What do you mean he's gone?

14:21.164 --> 14:23.166
It was a massive heart attack.

14:23.210 --> 14:24.515
We did everything we could.

14:26.474 --> 14:27.474
Why?

14:29.216 --> 14:30.870
No, no, no, oh my God!

14:33.611 --> 14:36.005
No, no, no, no!

14:37.267 --> 14:39.879
There was nothing wrg with him.

14:43.926 --> 14:46.233
I love him, I love him so much.

14:47.321 --> 14:48.321
No!

15:02.249 --> 15:03.249
Sweetheart?

15:11.301 --> 15:12.301
Oh, babe.

15:20.832 --> 15:22.269
Can I get you something to eat?

15:29.450 --> 15:32.018
Sweetheart, I know
this is the most

15:32.061 --> 15:33.889
horrible thing you've
ever been through.

15:35.021 --> 15:36.021
And it's horrible.

15:37.849 --> 15:39.199
But just know I'm here for you.

15:53.300 --> 15:54.866
I'll check on you in a bit.

16:23.504 --> 16:25.201
Leave a message for Jessica.

16:26.376 --> 16:28.900
Hey, it's me.

16:30.859 --> 16:33.383
Listen, I know
that you and Tessa

16:33.427 --> 16:35.081
are having a rough
time right now.

16:37.387 --> 16:42.088
But I just, I wanna let you
know that I'm here for you guys.

16:43.306 --> 16:47.484
And it'd be great to
hear from you soon.

16:49.443 --> 16:51.184
That's it, okay.

16:51.227 --> 16:52.227
Thanks, bye.

17:10.290 --> 17:13.902
Okay, you've got some
nice growth here in the back

17:13.944 --> 17:17.906
I think we should just clean
up the sides a little bit

17:17.949 --> 17:21.561
and then a little
bit on the top.

17:24.521 --> 17:26.696
I'm sorry, can you just
excuse me for a minute?

17:29.787 --> 17:31.267
I think you'll like that.

17:31.311 --> 17:32.877
Hey honey, you okay?

17:32.921 --> 17:34.227
Honestly, no.

17:34.270 --> 17:35.054
I'm not okay.

17:35.097 --> 17:35.837
I'll be right back.

17:35.880 --> 17:36.925
What's going on?

17:36.968 --> 17:38.274
Honey, is Tessa
still not eating?

17:38.318 --> 17:39.512
She's not eating,
she's not talking.

17:39.536 --> 17:40.557
You know what I want you to do?

17:40.581 --> 17:41.688
I think you should
call Christian

17:41.712 --> 17:43.323
and ask for a referral
for a therapist.

17:43.366 --> 17:44.237
I'm not gonna be able to get
Tessa to go see a therapist.

17:44.280 --> 17:45.475
Okay, then why don't you go?

17:45.499 --> 17:47.066
Maybe it would help
to talk to somebody.

17:47.109 --> 17:48.521
Well, I just don't understand
why she can't talk to me.

17:48.545 --> 17:51.461
Okay, I understand but
maybe just being around you

17:51.505 --> 17:53.178
reminds her of all the
good times with Will.

17:53.202 --> 17:55.944
Well, maybe that's
true but certainly

17:55.987 --> 17:58.294
I don't need Christian
to find a therapist.

17:58.338 --> 17:59.774
Why are you avoiding him?

17:59.817 --> 18:01.428
I'm not avoiding him.

18:01.471 --> 18:03.082
I'm just focusing
on my daughter.

18:06.998 --> 18:08.435
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

18:08.478 --> 18:09.523
I get it, okay?

18:09.566 --> 18:11.090
I get it, okay, go.

18:12.656 --> 18:14.156
Go home, okay honey I'll take
care of the clients today.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.877
- I can't stay home.
- Go!

18:15.920 --> 18:16.791
Are you sure?

18:16.834 --> 18:19.272
- I live for this.
- Okay.

18:19.315 --> 18:20.664
Okay goodbye, be safe.

18:37.377 --> 18:40.119
- Katherine.
- Hey.

18:40.162 --> 18:41.859
How did she do today?

18:41.903 --> 18:43.948
- It went very well.
- Really?

18:43.992 --> 18:45.385
Yeah, she can talk about it now

18:45.428 --> 18:46.908
which is a big step forward.

18:46.951 --> 18:49.215
Okay, that's
really good to hear.

18:49.258 --> 18:51.304
I'm extremely happy
with her progress.

18:51.347 --> 18:53.480
She's well on her way to
accepting what happened.

18:53.523 --> 18:56.222
Good, is there anything I
can do that I'm not doing?

18:56.265 --> 18:57.919
All you can do
is be there for her

18:57.962 --> 18:59.312
and I can tell you have been.

18:59.355 --> 19:01.444
Okay, well thank you.

19:01.488 --> 19:03.446
Thank you for everything.

19:03.490 --> 19:05.231
She's coming out of
this, don't you worry.

19:05.274 --> 19:06.274
Okay.

19:07.407 --> 19:08.906
Well, we'll see you
same time next week.

19:08.930 --> 19:11.019
- Yeah definitely.
- Okay.

19:11.062 --> 19:12.194
- You take care.
- Thank you.

19:38.873 --> 19:40.831
- Hi mom.
- Hi sweetheart.

19:42.311 --> 19:43.356
What you doing?

19:43.399 --> 19:45.880
Just chatting with some friends.

19:45.923 --> 19:46.923
Oh really?

19:47.534 --> 19:49.144
What friends?

19:49.188 --> 19:50.711
Just some people I met online.

19:51.929 --> 19:53.298
You know, Katherine said
that it would be a good idea

19:53.322 --> 19:55.237
to talk to people who have been

19:55.281 --> 19:56.649
through the same things
that I've been through.

19:56.673 --> 19:58.458
Yeah, that's good.

19:58.501 --> 20:00.068
I'm really glad for you.

20:00.111 --> 20:01.111
Thanks mom.

20:02.462 --> 20:05.247
You know you can talk
to me too, if you want.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.815
I mean, I know you think
maybe I wouldn't understand

20:07.858 --> 20:11.340
but your mom's been through
some pretty tough times herself.

20:11.384 --> 20:12.602
Hmm, mom, I know.

20:12.646 --> 20:15.214
But I'm really fine.

20:17.216 --> 20:20.349
Okay, well, can I make
you something to eat?

20:21.785 --> 20:24.353
Sure, sandwich would be great.

20:26.268 --> 20:28.183
Awesome, I will
make you a sandwich.

20:30.446 --> 20:32.187
Mom!

20:32.231 --> 20:34.512
Okay, sorry, one sandwich,
one sandwich coming right up.

20:48.812 --> 20:49.639
Hey!

20:49.683 --> 20:50.683
Are you busy?

20:52.251 --> 20:53.880
I did wanna let you know that
Katherine has really helped

20:53.904 --> 20:56.603
so thank you for that.

20:56.646 --> 20:58.300
I am glad to hear it.

20:58.344 --> 21:01.695
So, is that the only
reason you called?

21:03.044 --> 21:05.742
I'm sorry Christian but things

21:05.786 --> 21:07.178
are still really complicated.

21:08.441 --> 21:09.616
Tessa has to be my focus.

21:09.659 --> 21:11.574
She needs me right now.

21:11.618 --> 21:12.638
Alright, well I understand.

21:12.662 --> 21:15.099
But it is really
good seeing you.

21:15.143 --> 21:17.319
Alright, I'm really
glad to see you too Jess.

21:19.887 --> 21:22.455
Hmm, look, I'm glad
that you called me back

21:22.498 --> 21:23.818
because there's
something I wanted

21:23.847 --> 21:25.260
- to talk to you about.
- I know but Christian,

21:25.284 --> 21:27.131
- I just said I can't.
- It's not, it's not about us.

21:27.155 --> 21:28.417
Okay.

21:28.461 --> 21:29.723
It's about Will.

21:32.552 --> 21:34.336
What about Will?

21:34.380 --> 21:37.383
Look, we always run
a toxicology report

21:37.426 --> 21:40.124
whenever someone as young
as Will dies suddenly.

21:40.168 --> 21:41.624
Yeah and you said
it came back negative.

21:41.648 --> 21:44.520
It did, so then I ordered
an individual tissue test

21:44.564 --> 21:46.827
and that's when I
found something.

21:46.870 --> 21:48.611
You found what?

21:48.655 --> 21:53.312
I found very small traces
of a rare poison, Oleander.

21:53.355 --> 21:55.575
It doesn't show up
in blood samples

21:55.618 --> 21:57.794
because it's eliminated
from the body so quickly.

21:57.838 --> 21:59.579
It only resides in
certain tissues.

21:59.622 --> 22:01.755
Well, why didn't
someone see this before?

22:01.798 --> 22:03.757
These tests take time, Jess.

22:03.800 --> 22:06.020
And besides, Oleander,

22:06.063 --> 22:09.153
it mimics the symptoms
of a heart attack.

22:09.197 --> 22:12.548
It induces cardiac arrest,
it's hard to detect.

22:12.592 --> 22:15.638
Are you telling me that
someone poisoned Will?

22:15.682 --> 22:17.945
I'm telling you that
it is highly unlikely

22:17.988 --> 22:20.556
that he ingested
it accidentally.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.428
But who, who?

22:22.471 --> 22:23.753
I don't know, I don't know Jess.

22:23.777 --> 22:27.433
I just, I had to tell
you because I alerted.

22:29.086 --> 22:30.610
So there's gonna
be an investigation?

22:32.525 --> 22:33.980
And they wanna talk
to everyone involved.

22:34.004 --> 22:35.504
And they're gonna
drag Tessa right back

22:35.528 --> 22:38.008
through the hell that
she's just recovering from.

22:38.052 --> 22:39.052
Most likely.

22:40.271 --> 22:41.751
Alright, okay.

22:44.058 --> 22:47.801
I'll talk to Tessa and I guess
we'll just go from there.

22:52.109 --> 22:53.067
I'm sorry Jess, I know that this

22:53.110 --> 22:54.285
is the last thing you needed.

22:55.852 --> 22:56.852
Thanks.

23:14.697 --> 23:15.697
Tessa?

23:21.878 --> 23:23.663
Tessa, can I talk to you?

23:44.510 --> 23:46.076
Hey, it's
Tessa, leave a message.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.339
Tessa, it's 2AM, where are you?

23:48.383 --> 23:49.689
I'm getting really worried.

23:50.603 --> 23:51.603
Call me.

24:26.116 --> 24:27.116
Tessa?

24:43.525 --> 24:45.353
Tessa.

24:45.396 --> 24:46.572
What are you doing out here?

24:46.615 --> 24:48.138
Nothing.

24:48.182 --> 24:50.227
I mean this obviously
isn't nothing.

24:50.271 --> 24:51.054
Where have you been?

24:51.098 --> 24:52.969
Just out.

24:53.013 --> 24:54.057
Well, Tess!

24:55.494 --> 24:57.191
I need to talk to
you for a second.

24:57.234 --> 24:58.671
Tessa, wait!

24:58.714 --> 25:01.064
I don't wanna talk
and I don't feel good.

25:01.108 --> 25:01.978
I don't feel good either

25:02.022 --> 25:03.414
because I stayed up worried sick

25:03.458 --> 25:05.329
about my daughter
'til after 2AM!

25:06.722 --> 25:07.897
Now, I'm sorry.

25:07.941 --> 25:09.638
I'm sorry, okay?

25:09.682 --> 25:12.249
But I need to talk to you
and you were out very late.

25:12.293 --> 25:13.294
Yeah, so what?

25:13.337 --> 25:14.904
I'm 18.

25:14.948 --> 25:16.839
Yes, you're 18, I don't
know who you were out with

25:16.863 --> 25:19.126
and you used to tell
me everything, so...

25:19.169 --> 25:21.128
- Things change.
- Yes, sweetheart.

25:21.171 --> 25:23.739
You just went through
a major life event.

25:23.783 --> 25:25.393
I don't wanna talk about that.

25:25.436 --> 25:27.482
It's fine.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.397
Let's talk about
something, okay?

25:29.440 --> 25:30.616
Let's talk about anything.

25:30.659 --> 25:31.965
Let's just talk.

25:32.008 --> 25:33.401
Okay, fine.

25:33.444 --> 25:35.205
You bug me for weeks to
hang out with my friends

25:35.229 --> 25:37.405
and then I hang out with my
friends and you get pissed.

25:37.448 --> 25:40.451
So why don't you just
make up your damn mind?

25:40.495 --> 25:42.410
- Tessa, Tessa!
- What?

25:44.804 --> 25:47.589
Police don't think Will's
death was an accident.

25:47.633 --> 25:48.633
Wait, what?

25:52.507 --> 25:54.030
They think that
someone hurt Will.

25:55.641 --> 25:57.599
What are you talking about?

25:57.643 --> 25:59.470
They're launching a
criminal investigation.

26:01.298 --> 26:02.691
Who would wanna hurt Will?

26:02.735 --> 26:05.607
I don't know
sweetheart, I don't know.

26:05.651 --> 26:08.697
All I know is they wanna talk
to the people who knew him.

26:08.741 --> 26:10.177
So have they talked to you?

26:10.220 --> 26:12.222
Are they going to talk to me?

26:12.266 --> 26:14.398
Yeah, they will in time.

26:14.442 --> 26:16.096
I just, I wanted
to let you know.

26:18.315 --> 26:20.361
- Tessa.
- I just wanna be alone.

26:36.333 --> 26:38.074
I don't know who
she's hanging out with.

26:38.118 --> 26:39.467
Frankly I'm worrying.

26:39.510 --> 26:41.382
Do you think it's another boy?

26:41.425 --> 26:42.470
I don't know.

26:42.513 --> 26:43.665
Okay, well you still have her

26:43.689 --> 26:45.429
on your family cell
phone plan, right?

26:45.473 --> 26:47.083
Yeah.

26:47.127 --> 26:48.519
Well?

26:48.563 --> 26:50.696
I'm not gonna invade
her privacy like that.

26:50.739 --> 26:52.151
Jessica honey, you just
said that you were worried.

26:52.175 --> 26:53.481
If something happened to her,

26:53.524 --> 26:55.788
you would literally
never forgive yourself.

26:55.831 --> 26:57.441
- I know.
- Exactly.

26:57.485 --> 26:58.660
So give me the phone.

26:58.704 --> 26:59.618
No, I can't.

26:59.661 --> 27:01.097
I would feel terrible.

27:01.141 --> 27:03.491
Which is why you have
me to do your dirty work.

27:03.534 --> 27:05.014
Phone please, thank you.

27:05.058 --> 27:06.320
You are a sneaky woman.

27:06.363 --> 27:07.364
I know, right?

27:07.408 --> 27:08.539
It's also why you love me

27:08.583 --> 27:09.366
and I'm your best
friend in the world.

27:09.410 --> 27:10.280
- I know.
- Remember that.

27:10.324 --> 27:11.412
Okay.

27:13.849 --> 27:16.156
Okay, I found her.

27:17.461 --> 27:19.246
No, no, I got to talk to her.

27:19.289 --> 27:20.464
Okay, honey.

27:20.508 --> 27:21.920
That's just gonna
make things worse.

27:21.944 --> 27:23.792
But thank you, I know
you're just trying to help.

27:23.816 --> 27:24.816
I know.

27:47.927 --> 27:49.232
Thanks for making dinner mom.

27:49.276 --> 27:51.321
The chicken is really good.

27:51.365 --> 27:53.323
Well it should be, six
hours in the Crock-Pot.

27:57.850 --> 28:00.548
Do you have plans later tonight?

28:00.591 --> 28:01.591
Yeah.

28:02.593 --> 28:03.593
And who is he?

28:05.205 --> 28:06.365
What are you talking about?

28:07.642 --> 28:09.470
I don't wanna pry
into your life anymore.

28:09.513 --> 28:11.298
I mean, I want you to
share things with me

28:11.341 --> 28:14.388
but if you're not
there, I get it.

28:14.431 --> 28:16.191
But there's only one
thing that makes a woman

28:16.216 --> 28:18.827
smile like that and
it's not chicken.

28:20.046 --> 28:23.179
Well, it is really good chicken.

28:23.223 --> 28:24.267
It's not that good.

28:26.792 --> 28:27.792
Okay.

28:29.229 --> 28:31.318
Yes, I'm seeing someone.

28:31.361 --> 28:36.062
No, it's not serious but
yes, it might be someday.

28:37.890 --> 28:40.066
And no, you cannot meet him yet.

28:41.284 --> 28:42.284
Cool.

28:43.809 --> 28:47.247
I mean, as long as he treats
you right and you're happy.

28:51.338 --> 28:52.750
Don't forget I have to
go back to the salon.

28:52.774 --> 28:54.776
So I won't be home 'til later.

28:54.820 --> 28:55.820
Okay.

29:51.224 --> 29:52.834
Yes, someone's
broken into my salon.

29:54.444 --> 29:55.445
Yes, yes, hurry.

30:57.943 --> 30:59.292
I know it may be difficult

31:00.684 --> 31:02.556
but did you notice if
anything was stolen?

31:04.863 --> 31:05.951
No, nothing.

31:05.994 --> 31:07.604
There was even cash
in the register.

31:07.648 --> 31:09.476
He didn't take anything.

31:11.478 --> 31:13.480
Do you have any idea
who would do this to you?

31:15.961 --> 31:20.879
No.

32:05.010 --> 32:06.010
Mom?

32:08.100 --> 32:09.144
- Yeah.
- What's going on?

32:11.103 --> 32:12.452
Someone broke into the salon.

32:14.106 --> 32:16.325
Oh my God, are you okay?

32:16.369 --> 32:17.369
Yeah, I'm okay.

32:18.632 --> 32:20.677
- Yeah.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

32:22.549 --> 32:23.549
Oh my God.

32:52.622 --> 32:53.710
Tessa.

32:55.625 --> 32:56.625
Tessa?

33:03.329 --> 33:05.026
Where are you Tessa?

33:05.070 --> 33:06.158
Where are you?

33:07.376 --> 33:09.204
There you are.

34:57.399 --> 34:58.661
- Who is he?
- Who?

34:59.706 --> 35:01.403
The guy you're
seeing, who is he?

35:04.580 --> 35:06.756
It's Nancy, she saw you at
a restaurant with a man.

35:06.800 --> 35:09.237
With a much older man, Tessa.

35:10.891 --> 35:12.521
Obviously, this is why you're
not telling me anything.

35:12.545 --> 35:14.329
You're seeing someone
twice your age.

35:14.373 --> 35:15.330
Age is just a number.

35:15.374 --> 35:16.592
No it's not, Tessa.

35:16.636 --> 35:18.594
You're 18 years old.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.989
This is only gonna end
with you getting hurt.

35:22.032 --> 35:23.121
You don't know that.

35:25.471 --> 35:29.301
All I ask is that you
just meet him for dinner.

35:29.344 --> 35:30.650
Please mom?

35:32.869 --> 35:34.349
Then I'll do whatever you want.

35:36.090 --> 35:37.309
What is his name?

36:03.378 --> 36:04.378
Tessa?

36:07.469 --> 36:08.469
Tessa!

36:15.434 --> 36:16.434
Tess!

36:46.508 --> 36:48.641
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

36:52.166 --> 36:56.214
His name is Eric
and he wants to meet you.

37:04.744 --> 37:08.922
So what we do is
help US industries

37:08.965 --> 37:11.403
connect with skilled
labor overseas in order

37:11.446 --> 37:13.448
to manufacture the
products more efficiently.

37:13.492 --> 37:16.408
He has offices in
Singapore, Shanghai, Bangkok,

37:16.451 --> 37:18.975
he's been all over the world.

37:19.019 --> 37:20.542
But this is home.

37:20.586 --> 37:23.197
I much prefer a small
community over big cities.

37:23.241 --> 37:24.503
Well that's so nice.

37:24.546 --> 37:26.461
It sounds like you
have a wonderful life.

37:26.505 --> 37:27.984
I do, I'm lucky.

37:29.508 --> 37:32.206
Tessa tells me you're
an entrepreneur as well.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.425
You have your own salon.

37:33.468 --> 37:35.165
That must be fulfilling.

37:35.209 --> 37:37.037
Yes, it is.

37:40.823 --> 37:42.671
And go ahead and order
whatever you want, Ms. Taylor.

37:42.695 --> 37:44.087
Dinner is on me.

37:44.131 --> 37:45.437
Call me Jessica.

37:45.480 --> 37:46.960
We're the same age after all.

37:52.008 --> 37:53.248
I'm gonna go to the restroom.

37:56.796 --> 38:00.452
Order me the Chinese chicken
salad, dressing on the side.

38:00.495 --> 38:03.759
You got it sweetheart.

38:08.764 --> 38:11.506
I know you think I'm
too old for your daughter.

38:11.550 --> 38:14.379
But Tessa is not
just any 18-year old.

38:15.554 --> 38:17.686
She's a lot more mature
than her age suggests.

38:17.730 --> 38:20.298
I mean, I've never met someone
so interesting and smart.

38:21.603 --> 38:24.258
You don't have to tell
me how great Tessa is.

38:24.302 --> 38:26.173
See, Tessa is not
the problem Eric.

38:26.216 --> 38:27.696
The problem is you.

38:27.740 --> 38:29.060
I mean, why don't
you tell me what

38:29.089 --> 38:32.353
a 38-year old man sees
in an 18-year old girl.

38:32.397 --> 38:33.461
And you can cut the crap about

38:33.485 --> 38:36.488
oh, she's so mature
and intelligent.

38:36.531 --> 38:39.186
You know what, don't actually
answer that question, okay?

38:39.229 --> 38:41.536
I think I know what you find
so attractive about her.

38:43.886 --> 38:48.195
The point is, what I'm
trying to communicate

38:48.238 --> 38:50.197
is that I care about Tessa.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.373
And she's had a
very difficult year.

38:52.417 --> 38:54.288
And I think I've been helpful

38:54.332 --> 38:57.073
in getting her past
the hard times.

38:57.117 --> 38:58.399
And what would you
know about the hard times

38:58.423 --> 38:59.554
that we've been through?

39:01.339 --> 39:04.298
I lost my sister
last year, cancer.

39:05.908 --> 39:07.214
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

39:10.522 --> 39:12.611
When Tessa and I first
started chatting online,

39:14.177 --> 39:15.527
I only wanted to
help someone see

39:15.570 --> 39:17.267
past the worst
moment of their life.

39:17.311 --> 39:20.619
To imagine a more
hopeful future.

39:20.662 --> 39:23.230
I just wanted to help someone
like others that helped me.

39:24.753 --> 39:26.731
You may not believe me and
that's not important to me

39:26.755 --> 39:28.278
because I'm the one who has

39:28.322 --> 39:30.280
to look myself in the
mirror every morning.

39:32.848 --> 39:35.721
Please know that I care
about her very much.

39:35.764 --> 39:37.940
I didn't feel comfortable
continuing to talk to her

39:37.984 --> 39:39.942
before I met you and asked

39:39.986 --> 39:41.683
for your permission
to keep seeing her.

39:43.250 --> 39:45.208
But I understand
your apprehension.

39:46.688 --> 39:48.734
And I will honor whatever
decision you make.

40:02.487 --> 40:05.446
I am very sorry about
your sister, Eric.

40:05.490 --> 40:08.536
And I thank you for being
a good friend to Tessa

40:08.580 --> 40:10.460
but I don't want you
seeing my daughter anymore,

40:10.495 --> 40:11.974
romantically or otherwise.

40:13.411 --> 40:14.411
Am I clear?

40:16.065 --> 40:18.416
Yes, of course.

40:18.459 --> 40:19.459
Good.

40:30.732 --> 40:33.082
I will let Tessa down
gently and take the blame

40:33.126 --> 40:36.825
so as to not cause problems
between you and your daughter.

40:36.869 --> 40:38.740
Well, I appreciate that.

40:44.529 --> 40:47.227
You seem like a good, decent guy

40:47.270 --> 40:49.490
and I'm sure someday you'll
make someone very happy.

40:50.796 --> 40:53.363
Hopefully she'll be as
wonderful as your daughter,

40:53.407 --> 40:54.407
only 10 years older.

41:03.330 --> 41:05.288
Thank you for agreeing
to have dinner with me.

41:06.812 --> 41:09.423
Let's just get through this
as if things went well.

41:09.467 --> 41:10.467
I agree.

41:12.208 --> 41:14.341
So, what did I miss?

41:30.531 --> 41:32.490
- Hey.
- What did you do?

41:32.533 --> 41:33.447
What are you talking about?

41:33.491 --> 41:34.796
What did you tell Eric?

41:34.840 --> 41:37.495
He just broke up with
me for no reason.

41:38.757 --> 41:39.757
What did he say?

41:40.802 --> 41:42.282
That things weren't working out.

41:43.588 --> 41:45.590
Listen, Tessa I know
you're really upset

41:45.633 --> 41:48.288
but I always said that
was never gonna last.

41:48.331 --> 41:50.551
I know you told him to do it.

41:50.595 --> 41:52.031
Is that what he told you?

41:52.074 --> 41:55.600
No, he didn't tell me
anything, he just ended it.

41:55.643 --> 41:57.602
But I'm not gonna
let you ruin my life.

41:57.645 --> 41:59.865
He has been the only thing

41:59.908 --> 42:02.084
that's made me happy
since Will died.

42:02.128 --> 42:03.564
I understand but listen, babe,

42:03.608 --> 42:04.672
it wouldn't have
worked with Eric.

42:04.696 --> 42:06.349
You're going to VIT in the fall.

42:06.393 --> 42:07.631
I mean, what would
you have done?

42:07.655 --> 42:08.917
I'm not going to VIT.

42:08.961 --> 42:10.528
I didn't accept the offer.

42:10.571 --> 42:12.181
What are you even talking about?

42:12.225 --> 42:16.316
I don't care about
VIT, I wanna be happy.

42:16.359 --> 42:18.187
All you care about is
college and grades,

42:18.231 --> 42:19.687
you don't care about
what makes me happy.

42:19.711 --> 42:21.451
Eric made me happy.

42:21.495 --> 42:23.715
I hear you, I hear
how upset you are

42:23.758 --> 42:25.388
but you've got to know,
this is all for the best.

42:25.412 --> 42:26.412
Oh God!

42:27.109 --> 42:28.109
Tess?

42:28.850 --> 42:29.850
Tessa!

42:56.051 --> 42:57.411
Hey, it's
Tessa, leave a message.

42:59.881 --> 43:02.536
Tessa, hey it's mom,
just please give me a call.

43:02.580 --> 43:03.668
Let me know you're okay.

43:03.711 --> 43:05.017
Alright, love you.

43:43.621 --> 43:44.621
One sec.

43:50.018 --> 43:51.280
- Hey.
- Hi.

43:52.499 --> 43:53.805
What's wrong?

43:53.848 --> 43:55.937
Can I come in?

43:55.981 --> 43:57.243
Yeah, of course, come on.

44:02.552 --> 44:04.206
So I'm sorry to bother you.

44:04.250 --> 44:05.599
It's fine, Jess.

44:05.643 --> 44:07.340
Just tell me how
long she's been gone.

44:08.863 --> 44:11.866
She left yesterday and she
didn't come home last night.

44:15.174 --> 44:17.306
Okay, did you try to
locate her on her cell?

44:18.743 --> 44:20.266
Yeah, she disabled her cell.

44:22.224 --> 44:23.593
And you think that
she's with this guy?

44:23.617 --> 44:24.879
Eric Pritt?

44:24.923 --> 44:26.620
I don't know.

44:26.664 --> 44:28.250
I mean, he said he was
gonna break up with her.

44:28.274 --> 44:30.624
He did break up with her.

44:30.668 --> 44:31.538
Okay, good, so she's probably

44:31.581 --> 44:33.366
just out blowing off some steam.

44:33.409 --> 44:35.629
But the police won't
do anything for 48 hours.

44:35.673 --> 44:38.588
And I can't wait 48
hours, Christian.

44:38.632 --> 44:39.632
So please.

44:42.462 --> 44:43.462
Please.

44:45.291 --> 44:47.182
I mean, I guess I could
use the hospital server

44:47.206 --> 44:49.425
to search his insurance records.

44:49.469 --> 44:51.732
I mean, if Eric Pritt
has been to a doctor

44:51.776 --> 44:53.081
or a hospital in the area,

44:53.125 --> 44:55.214
at least his contact
information would show up.

44:55.257 --> 44:57.869
It's just, it's really not
ethical for me to do that.

44:57.912 --> 45:00.088
Christian, please.

45:02.569 --> 45:03.569
Please.

45:05.659 --> 45:06.659
Okay, fine.

45:10.664 --> 45:11.664
Okay, here we go.

45:12.840 --> 45:13.904
Eric Pritt, it looks like he was

45:13.928 --> 45:16.496
in the ER at Mercy last March.

45:16.539 --> 45:19.673
Lacerations to the torso,
suspected knife wounds.

45:19.717 --> 45:20.848
Jess, who is this guy?

45:20.892 --> 45:23.285
I don't know but
I'm gonna find out.

45:24.634 --> 45:26.419
Pull up his insurance
information.

45:26.462 --> 45:27.637
Why?

45:27.681 --> 45:28.726
Just do it.

45:30.989 --> 45:32.773
Let's see, primary
care physician,

45:32.817 --> 45:35.689
address, billing, here,
looks like he's insured

45:35.733 --> 45:37.473
through his union
public utilities.

45:38.692 --> 45:40.868
He said he was CEO
of a corporation.

45:40.912 --> 45:42.522
Well that doesn't
make any sense.

45:42.565 --> 45:44.785
What kind of a CEO works for
a public utilities company?

45:46.134 --> 45:47.134
One who's lying.

45:48.615 --> 45:50.878
Thank you, okay, thank
you for everything.

45:50.922 --> 45:53.141
Whoa, whoa, where are you going?

45:53.185 --> 45:54.534
I'm going to get my daughter.

45:54.577 --> 45:56.492
No, not alone you're not.

45:56.536 --> 45:58.209
Christian, you can't
take this any further.

45:58.233 --> 45:59.558
You could already
lose your license

45:59.582 --> 46:01.038
for the information
you shared with me.

46:01.062 --> 46:02.387
Thank you for
reminding me of that

46:02.411 --> 46:04.805
but Jess, something worse
could happen to you.

46:04.849 --> 46:05.849
I'll be fine.

47:57.439 --> 47:58.439
Tessa!

48:00.529 --> 48:02.531
Tessa open up, I know
you're in there babe.

48:03.445 --> 48:04.445
Tessa!

48:28.688 --> 48:30.733
Mom, what are you doing?

48:30.777 --> 48:33.127
Tessa, get in your
car and go home.

48:33.171 --> 48:35.173
I'm 18, I can do
whatever I want.

48:35.216 --> 48:37.218
Tessa, get in your
car and go home now.

48:38.567 --> 48:39.567
Hello, Ms. Taylor.

48:41.396 --> 48:42.658
Stay away from her.

48:42.702 --> 48:44.530
I had every intention
of doing that.

48:44.573 --> 48:45.661
You lied to me.

48:45.705 --> 48:46.619
No, I broke things
off with Tessa

48:46.662 --> 48:48.534
just as I said Ms. Taylor.

48:48.577 --> 48:49.990
- Oh, don't call me that.
- And I didn't say anything

48:50.014 --> 48:51.580
about you making me
break up with her.

48:51.624 --> 48:52.755
Stay away from her!

48:52.799 --> 48:54.496
Your daughter
called me last night.

48:54.540 --> 48:56.150
She said she had to
get away from you.

48:57.760 --> 48:58.868
She said she never
wanted to see you again

48:58.892 --> 49:01.460
and I convinced
her not to do that.

49:01.503 --> 49:03.201
I know you lied about your job.

49:03.244 --> 49:04.942
Do you even have a
sister with cancer?

49:11.644 --> 49:14.342
No, I lied about that too.

49:16.127 --> 49:17.519
If you come around Tessa again,

49:18.738 --> 49:19.738
I will have you arrested.

49:20.653 --> 49:21.653
On what charges?

49:22.524 --> 49:23.656
She can do what she wants.

49:23.699 --> 49:24.962
See whoever she chooses.

49:26.354 --> 49:27.965
She's a grown woman, Ms. Taylor.

49:29.140 --> 49:31.881
Believe me, I know.

49:34.014 --> 49:35.711
Stay away from her!

49:42.544 --> 49:44.416
Go home.

49:44.459 --> 49:47.201
Make things right with
your daughter Ms. Taylor.

49:47.245 --> 49:50.378
You see, me and Tessa decided
we're not breaking up.

49:51.814 --> 49:54.469
And I hope you will
just let things be

49:54.513 --> 49:57.429
and not completely destroy
your mother-daughter bond.

49:59.822 --> 50:04.001
If you try to keep her from
seeing me again, I'll kill you.

50:05.306 --> 50:06.306
Do you understand?

50:13.445 --> 50:14.750
Bye, Ms. Taylor.

51:18.031 --> 51:19.598
Tessa.

51:19.641 --> 51:20.903
- Tessa, listen.
- Mom,

51:20.947 --> 51:22.316
I really don't wanna
talk to you right now.

51:22.340 --> 51:23.578
I know you don't but
you've got to listen okay?

51:23.602 --> 51:26.474
He is violent, he grabbed me,

51:26.518 --> 51:28.433
- he threatened me.
- Well, what do you expect?

51:28.476 --> 51:30.783
You broke into his house.

51:30.826 --> 51:32.543
I didn't break into
his house, sweetheart.

51:32.567 --> 51:34.439
The door was open, I
was looking for you.

51:34.482 --> 51:36.223
Rushing and
screaming and yelling.

51:36.267 --> 51:37.461
I didn't know where
you were last night,

51:37.485 --> 51:38.573
you didn't come home.

51:38.617 --> 51:40.140
I was worried about you.

51:40.184 --> 51:41.770
Okay, I don't wanna hear
anything else about Eric.

51:41.794 --> 51:44.579
I love him, he loves me.

51:44.623 --> 51:46.494
We're not breaking up.

51:46.538 --> 51:47.538
Tessa.

51:49.323 --> 51:50.323
Tessa!

51:56.504 --> 51:57.984
Okay look, look at me.

51:58.027 --> 51:59.027
Does this hurt?

51:59.768 --> 52:01.466
No.

52:01.509 --> 52:03.163
It feels fine.

52:03.207 --> 52:05.367
Is that the face that you
make when something's fine?

52:06.035 --> 52:07.796
Can you just give me
some pain pills, please?

52:07.820 --> 52:09.822
You could've been
seriously hurt.

52:09.865 --> 52:11.650
I know but I wasn't.

52:11.693 --> 52:13.652
You should go to the police.

52:13.695 --> 52:15.543
If I go to the police,
Tessa is just gonna accuse me

52:15.567 --> 52:17.090
of trying to take
revenge on Eric.

52:17.134 --> 52:19.266
He is dangerous, he
threatened your life.

52:19.310 --> 52:23.052
I know but I can't make
Tessa break up with him.

52:23.096 --> 52:24.508
I have to convince
her that she wants

52:24.532 --> 52:25.553
to break up with him herself.

52:25.577 --> 52:26.665
And how do you do that?

52:26.708 --> 52:30.147
By letting her
see how awful he is.

52:30.190 --> 52:32.279
Those stab wounds in
the medical records.

52:32.323 --> 52:34.107
- Hmm mm?
- Does it say how he got 'em?

52:34.151 --> 52:36.805
No, it was probably
a street fight

52:36.849 --> 52:38.957
and that might make him seem
cooler to Tess, if anything.

52:38.981 --> 52:41.201
People, they just don't
become violent overnight.

52:41.245 --> 52:42.811
Well that's true.

52:42.855 --> 52:44.920
People usually have a long
history of mental illness.

52:44.944 --> 52:47.816
So maybe we need to delve
deeper into the medical records.

52:47.860 --> 52:50.558
Okay, contact
information is one thing

52:50.602 --> 52:52.623
but I don't even have access
to people's medical records

52:52.647 --> 52:54.519
unless they're my patients.

52:54.562 --> 52:56.477
Okay, but you could see

52:56.521 --> 52:57.672
who his primary
care physician was.

52:57.696 --> 53:00.220
But that doesn't
give us anything.

53:00.264 --> 53:02.527
Unless the court subpoenas
his primary care physician

53:02.570 --> 53:04.311
for the medical records.

53:04.355 --> 53:06.052
How are you going
to get a subpoena?

53:08.228 --> 53:09.228
I think I know.

53:11.710 --> 53:12.991
Without a
trial, there is no reason

53:13.015 --> 53:14.539
for a judge to issue a subpoena.

53:14.582 --> 53:18.586
Okay, so what if I
don't go to the police?

53:18.630 --> 53:20.588
What if I file a civil case?

53:20.632 --> 53:21.937
In civil litigation,

53:21.981 --> 53:23.611
it is the lawyer who
issues the subpoenas.

53:23.635 --> 53:25.047
Yeah, and then I
just need the evidence

53:25.071 --> 53:27.005
that Eric is not the great
guy Tessa thinks he is.

53:27.029 --> 53:28.074
And I'm the lawyer why?

53:29.597 --> 53:30.705
I'll get on it,
girl but I want you

53:30.729 --> 53:32.644
to do something
for me first, okay?

53:32.687 --> 53:33.687
What?

53:35.081 --> 53:36.256
I want you to take this.

53:39.564 --> 53:40.608
Why do you have that?

53:40.652 --> 53:42.044
Just in case.

53:42.088 --> 53:43.611
Just in case of what?

53:43.655 --> 53:45.787
Just in case something
like this happens.

53:45.831 --> 53:48.094
No, you know I hate guns.

53:48.137 --> 53:50.966
Honey, this guy's already
threatened to kill you.

53:51.010 --> 53:52.640
I don't want a gun in
the house with Tessa.

53:52.664 --> 53:54.511
I just want you to be
able to protect yourself.

53:54.535 --> 53:59.671
Thank you, no.

53:59.714 --> 54:01.586
Okay, okay.

54:04.632 --> 54:06.243
Can you get me that subpoena?

54:06.286 --> 54:09.507
Okay, okay.

54:09.550 --> 54:10.377
Let's do it.

54:10.421 --> 54:11.421
Let's get to work.

54:20.605 --> 54:23.303
- Hello.
- Hey, it's me.

54:23.347 --> 54:24.913
- Where are you?
- I'm running.

54:24.957 --> 54:26.282
Jessica how quick
can you meet me?

54:26.306 --> 54:27.873
Why, what's up?

54:27.916 --> 54:29.590
I think it's
better if we talk in person.

54:29.614 --> 54:31.616
Christian, you're scaring me.

54:31.659 --> 54:34.532
Look, can you be at
my place in a half hour?

54:34.575 --> 54:35.750
Okay, see you then.

54:37.056 --> 54:38.100
I'll see you there, bye.

54:51.157 --> 54:53.420
Okay, so thanks
to you and Nancy,

54:53.464 --> 54:55.466
Eric's primary care
physician was forced

54:55.509 --> 54:56.858
to turn over his
medical history.

54:56.902 --> 54:57.902
Okay.

54:59.818 --> 55:02.821
He was in the psychiatric
hospital for the last six years.

55:02.864 --> 55:04.736
God, why?

55:04.779 --> 55:06.757
The medical records don't
give specific information

55:06.781 --> 55:11.264
but Jess it was a maximum
security facility.

55:11.308 --> 55:12.548
So he did something criminal.

55:14.180 --> 55:15.486
He must have hurt someone.

55:15.529 --> 55:16.529
I'm afraid so.

55:18.619 --> 55:19.770
Do you think he could be the one

55:19.794 --> 55:23.363
responsible for killing Will?

55:23.407 --> 55:25.017
Maybe to hurt Tessa?

55:25.060 --> 55:26.279
To get to me?

55:26.323 --> 55:27.759
We don't know that, okay?

55:27.802 --> 55:29.084
But I think that
we need to get you

55:29.108 --> 55:31.110
and Tessa some place safe.

55:31.153 --> 55:33.895
This guy is clearly crazy
and possibly very dangerous.

55:33.939 --> 55:35.680
Okay, okay.

55:43.078 --> 55:43.862
What?

55:43.905 --> 55:45.167
I know you're mad at me

55:45.211 --> 55:46.884
but I really just need
you to listen to me.

55:46.908 --> 55:49.433
I don't wanna listen to
anything you have to say.

55:49.476 --> 55:51.043
Okay, okay, you
don't have to listen.

55:51.086 --> 55:53.480
Just tell me where you are.

55:54.786 --> 55:56.744
I'm not home.

55:56.788 --> 56:00.531
- Are you with him?
- Yes.

56:00.574 --> 56:01.574
Is he next to you?

56:03.272 --> 56:04.272
Yeah.

56:05.144 --> 56:06.537
Okay, don't alarm him,

56:06.580 --> 56:08.930
don't let him know you're
talking to me, okay?

56:08.974 --> 56:10.671
But you got to get out of there.

56:10.715 --> 56:12.954
You got to just make up some
excuse and get out of there.

56:12.978 --> 56:13.978
You're in danger.

56:15.807 --> 56:17.647
Okay, what's going on
mom, you're scaring me.

56:18.679 --> 56:21.421
Tessa, your life is in danger.

56:23.075 --> 56:25.469
I need you to get out
of there now, okay?

56:25.512 --> 56:27.775
Don't hang up but do it now.

56:27.819 --> 56:29.516
Go, go.

56:29.560 --> 56:30.604
Everything okay babe?

56:33.651 --> 56:36.393
Hmm, no, it's not.

56:37.350 --> 56:38.350
What's wrong?

56:39.483 --> 56:42.050
My friend, Emily,
she's in the hospital.

56:44.357 --> 56:45.357
Who's Emily?

56:46.490 --> 56:49.971
You don't know
her, I have to go.

56:50.015 --> 56:51.015
I'll take you.

56:52.234 --> 56:53.627
You don't even know her.

56:53.671 --> 56:56.151
I don't care, you're
in no condition to drive.

56:56.195 --> 56:57.544
Eric, I'm fine.

57:00.199 --> 57:02.114
I love you, I'll call
you when I get there.

57:09.121 --> 57:10.121
You promise?

57:13.517 --> 57:15.040
Yes, of course.

57:19.479 --> 57:21.220
Don't worry, I'll come by later.

57:22.526 --> 57:24.745
It's not like I can go
home to my crazy mother.

57:32.057 --> 57:33.406
Okay babe.

57:33.450 --> 57:35.713
Call me when you get there.

57:59.911 --> 58:01.042
Let go.

58:01.086 --> 58:02.435
Why are you acting so weird?

58:02.479 --> 58:04.959
My friend is in the
hospital, I have to go.

58:32.465 --> 58:33.771
Mom, what's going on?

58:33.814 --> 58:35.313
Just meet me at the
police station, okay?

58:35.337 --> 58:37.601
And don't stop
until you get there.

58:37.644 --> 58:38.906
I'll explain everything.

58:38.950 --> 58:41.213
Okay, I'll meet you there.

58:41.256 --> 58:42.256
Love you.

58:43.737 --> 58:45.086
She made it.

58:45.130 --> 58:47.132
She got out.

58:47.175 --> 58:48.786
Okay, it's gonna be okay.

58:48.829 --> 58:49.874
- Yeah.
- Okay?

58:51.005 --> 58:53.573
I got to go to
the police station.

58:53.617 --> 58:54.617
- Okay.
- I got to go.

58:56.141 --> 58:58.273
Thank you, thank you.

59:11.504 --> 59:12.504
Hey.

59:19.512 --> 59:21.601
I don't understand.

59:21.645 --> 59:23.037
He seemed like
such a nice person.

59:23.081 --> 59:25.257
Why is he doing this?

59:25.300 --> 59:26.300
I don't know.

59:27.912 --> 59:30.436
All I know is that this
man was locked away

59:30.479 --> 59:32.656
in a maximum security
psychiatric facility.

59:32.699 --> 59:34.571
He is dangerous, Tess.

59:36.355 --> 59:38.270
Well, what if I
don't believe you?

59:39.488 --> 59:40.528
Have I ever lied to you?

59:42.274 --> 59:43.274
Have I?

59:45.451 --> 59:46.539
No, no, never.

59:48.672 --> 59:49.672
I mean...

59:53.590 --> 59:58.203
I just, I don't understand
why he would do this to me.

59:59.900 --> 01:00:01.249
It's okay.

01:00:01.293 --> 01:00:03.861
No, I loved him.

01:00:03.904 --> 01:00:04.904
Come here.

01:00:06.385 --> 01:00:07.821
We are gonna get through this.

01:00:09.388 --> 01:00:11.172
We always do.

01:00:12.391 --> 01:00:13.391
No matter what.

01:00:16.264 --> 01:00:18.049
Right this way ladies.

01:00:18.092 --> 01:00:19.485
Alright, come on.

01:01:01.396 --> 01:01:02.659
Right this way ladies.

01:01:03.877 --> 01:01:04.877
Thank you.

01:01:07.446 --> 01:01:09.404
And you say this Eric
Pritt assaulted you.

01:01:09.448 --> 01:01:11.493
Yes, he has a psychotic past

01:01:11.537 --> 01:01:13.408
and he's been
seeing my daughter.

01:01:14.758 --> 01:01:17.586
Nothing illegal about a 38-year
old dating an 18-year-old.

01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:19.458
Well, I don't care
if it's legal or not.

01:01:19.501 --> 01:01:22.374
This man was locked away in
a psychiatric ward for years.

01:01:24.332 --> 01:01:26.726
Well, you can press charges
for the most recent assault.

01:01:26.770 --> 01:01:28.554
But I want him locked up again.

01:01:28.597 --> 01:01:30.730
I know he killed my
daughter's boyfriend.

01:01:30.774 --> 01:01:32.253
And now my daughter is in danger

01:01:32.297 --> 01:01:33.907
so you need to do something.

01:01:35.561 --> 01:01:37.476
Did he ever try to hurt you?

01:01:39.217 --> 01:01:40.740
No.

01:01:40.784 --> 01:01:42.500
But he would have and
he's already killed someone

01:01:42.524 --> 01:01:43.395
so what, are you
just gonna sit around

01:01:43.438 --> 01:01:44.718
and wait for him to do it again?

01:01:44.744 --> 01:01:46.528
Okay, alright, let's
just take a breath.

01:01:48.617 --> 01:01:50.837
I will look into the Will
Radford investigation

01:01:50.881 --> 01:01:52.665
to see where they are at.

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:55.363
I can also bring this Eric
Pritt in for the assault charge

01:01:55.407 --> 01:01:57.487
but I'm afraid we won't be
able to hold him for long.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.282
So what do we do
in the meantime?

01:02:03.807 --> 01:02:04.958
You have a friend
you can stay with

01:02:04.982 --> 01:02:06.331
just to be on the safe side?

01:02:06.374 --> 01:02:08.289
Yeah, Nancy.

01:02:12.076 --> 01:02:14.396
I suggest you go and stay
with her until we can find him.

01:02:24.697 --> 01:02:27.961
You got this,
okay, you got this.

01:02:28.005 --> 01:02:29.069
Do you really need
this many books?

01:02:29.093 --> 01:02:30.093
I mean, ugh.

01:02:33.401 --> 01:02:34.401
Really?

01:02:37.275 --> 01:02:38.275
I mean really?

01:03:27.586 --> 01:03:28.586
Hello?

01:04:22.075 --> 01:04:23.555
Hello Nancy.

01:04:23.598 --> 01:04:24.904
We haven't met.

01:04:24.948 --> 01:04:25.948
I'm Tess' boyfriend.

01:04:29.387 --> 01:04:32.651
What, what are you
doing in my house?

01:04:34.348 --> 01:04:35.523
I wanted to meet you.

01:04:36.655 --> 01:04:38.352
Tess has told me
so much about you.

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:41.877
My name is Eric.

01:04:45.490 --> 01:04:48.797
Don't worry Nancy, I'm
not going to hurt you.

01:04:51.975 --> 01:04:52.975
Does...

01:04:54.325 --> 01:04:56.109
Does Tessa know
that you're here?

01:04:59.112 --> 01:05:01.898
No, but she'll
find out soon enough.

01:05:06.554 --> 01:05:08.513
Where you going?

01:05:08.556 --> 01:05:09.949
Nancy!

01:05:11.951 --> 01:05:15.041
No, get away from me, no, no!

01:05:15.085 --> 01:05:17.391
No, let me go, stop!

01:05:17.435 --> 01:05:19.741
- Let me go, stop!
- Relax.

01:05:19.785 --> 01:05:22.570
Somebody, somebody help me!

01:05:22.614 --> 01:05:23.615
Stop, please!

01:05:24.877 --> 01:05:27.140
- Please, get off of me, stop!
- Relax.

01:05:27.184 --> 01:05:29.664
Please, stop, stop, stop, stop!

01:05:36.628 --> 01:05:37.890
Hey, I finished packing.

01:05:39.283 --> 01:05:41.328
We got to hurry Tessa,
he could be on his way.

01:05:41.372 --> 01:05:43.287
- Mom?
- Yeah?

01:05:43.330 --> 01:05:45.550
You were right all along,
I should've listened to you.

01:05:45.593 --> 01:05:46.812
I'm so sorry.

01:05:46.855 --> 01:05:48.292
Listen, it's okay.

01:05:48.335 --> 01:05:49.573
The important thing
is we're together now

01:05:49.597 --> 01:05:51.077
and this is all almost over.

01:05:51.121 --> 01:05:52.949
But we got to go, it's not safe.

01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:55.951
Okay.

01:06:10.053 --> 01:06:11.271
Nancy never texted back.

01:06:12.403 --> 01:06:13.578
That's not like her.

01:06:13.621 --> 01:06:15.319
No, her class was
out two hours ago,

01:06:15.362 --> 01:06:17.408
she'd definitely be home by now.

01:06:17.451 --> 01:06:18.451
Her car is here.

01:06:19.366 --> 01:06:20.366
Alright, let's go.

01:06:48.091 --> 01:06:49.091
Nancy?

01:06:52.225 --> 01:06:53.225
Are you here?

01:06:55.141 --> 01:06:56.141
Nancy!

01:07:10.461 --> 01:07:11.461
Tessa, Tessa!

01:07:17.337 --> 01:07:18.425
Tessa!

01:07:18.469 --> 01:07:19.469
- Mom!
- Tessa!

01:07:22.342 --> 01:07:23.342
Oh no.

01:07:26.694 --> 01:07:28.870
Eric was here.

01:07:28.914 --> 01:07:30.089
We got to go sweetheart.

01:07:31.134 --> 01:07:32.526
Mom, what happened to Nancy?

01:07:32.570 --> 01:07:34.354
I'm sure Nancy is fine

01:07:34.398 --> 01:07:36.791
but sweetheart we
have got to go now.

01:07:36.835 --> 01:07:37.835
Mom!

01:07:42.145 --> 01:07:43.145
What's wrong?

01:07:45.496 --> 01:07:46.714
Mom, is that a gun?

01:07:46.758 --> 01:07:48.934
- Yes it is.
- What are you doing?

01:07:48.977 --> 01:07:51.328
Something I should've done
when Nancy first offered.

01:08:00.946 --> 01:08:01.946
What happened?

01:08:03.557 --> 01:08:05.211
Eric took Nancy.

01:08:06.821 --> 01:08:08.519
I just need you to
take care of Tessa.

01:08:08.562 --> 01:08:09.389
Yeah, of course but...

01:08:09.433 --> 01:08:10.608
Mom, I wanna be with you.

01:08:10.651 --> 01:08:12.827
I know sweetheart
but you can't, okay?

01:08:12.871 --> 01:08:13.785
It's not safe.

01:08:13.828 --> 01:08:15.308
Jessica, where are you going?

01:08:15.352 --> 01:08:17.571
I'm going to make sure
the detective does his job.

01:08:17.615 --> 01:08:18.616
What does that mean?

01:08:20.008 --> 01:08:21.923
Thank you, okay, thank
you for everything.

01:08:21.966 --> 01:08:25.057
Jessica, be careful!

01:08:44.859 --> 01:08:46.446
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm gonna
need you to stay in the car.

01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:48.428
My friend is in there.

01:08:48.471 --> 01:08:49.884
And she could be dead because
you didn't do your job

01:08:49.908 --> 01:08:51.388
when I first came to you.

01:08:53.825 --> 01:08:54.825
Stay behind me.

01:09:05.270 --> 01:09:06.707
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:09:28.468 --> 01:09:29.426
Freeze, freeze!

01:09:29.469 --> 01:09:30.340
I said hold on right there!

01:09:30.383 --> 01:09:31.602
Hands up!

01:09:31.645 --> 01:09:32.515
Are you pointing a gun at me?

01:09:32.559 --> 01:09:34.082
Knock it out.

01:09:34.126 --> 01:09:36.345
Keep coming, keep it coming.

01:09:36.389 --> 01:09:38.174
Hands on top of your head.

01:09:39.261 --> 01:09:40.261
Down to your knees.

01:09:44.658 --> 01:09:47.051
Nice and slow, who are
you and where is Eric?

01:09:47.095 --> 01:09:49.707
I don't know,
I'm just his roommate.

01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:51.206
You're his roommate but
don't know where he is, huh?

01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:52.318
No, okay?

01:09:52.362 --> 01:09:53.711
Then why were you running?

01:09:53.754 --> 01:09:55.321
'Cause you're a cop.

01:09:57.323 --> 01:09:58.498
I didn't do anything, okay?

01:09:58.542 --> 01:10:00.761
I just hang out
with him sometimes.

01:10:09.466 --> 01:10:10.771
God!

01:10:22.914 --> 01:10:24.307
Where are we going?

01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:25.525
Goodnight then.

01:10:25.569 --> 01:10:27.005
Well, I'm all done
for the day here

01:10:27.048 --> 01:10:29.834
so we'll go to my house
and you can wait there

01:10:29.877 --> 01:10:31.227
until we hear from your mom.

01:10:32.532 --> 01:10:33.664
Why hasn't she called?

01:10:35.318 --> 01:10:36.318
I don't know Tess.

01:10:37.450 --> 01:10:39.539
Look, everything's
gonna be fine, okay?

01:10:41.411 --> 01:10:42.411
Come on.

01:10:47.591 --> 01:10:50.855
Okay, you have to tell
me everything that happened

01:10:50.898 --> 01:10:52.291
when you were
attacked in college.

01:10:56.252 --> 01:10:57.427
It was so long ago.

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:03.476
And I only survived

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:05.348
because the people
nearby heard me scream.

01:11:05.391 --> 01:11:06.391
Help!

01:11:09.439 --> 01:11:11.441
Then they locked him
up in a psych hospital.

01:11:13.921 --> 01:11:16.315
I just thought this was
all part of my past.

01:11:16.359 --> 01:11:17.901
And in no point did
you recognize Eric

01:11:17.925 --> 01:11:20.101
as the man who attacked
you in college?

01:11:20.145 --> 01:11:22.278
No, back then I never
even saw his face.

01:11:25.150 --> 01:11:27.457
I mean, the police used DNA

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:29.328
under my fingernails
to identify him.

01:11:31.374 --> 01:11:32.984
I only learned about his name.

01:11:33.027 --> 01:11:34.159
Jeremy Smithh.

01:11:34.202 --> 01:11:35.987
Yeah, at the
trial, and even then

01:11:36.030 --> 01:11:38.163
I could not bear to look at him.

01:11:38.206 --> 01:11:39.295
And it was 20 years ago.

01:11:41.384 --> 01:11:43.864
I think I know why
he's doing this.

01:11:43.908 --> 01:11:45.736
What do you mean?

01:11:45.779 --> 01:11:49.305
He was locked away in a
psychiatric hospital for 19 years.

01:11:49.348 --> 01:11:51.698
Never had a chance to
build a life for himself.

01:11:51.742 --> 01:11:54.484
Now that he's out,
he's gonna try

01:11:54.527 --> 01:11:57.225
and take away everything I've
built for the last 19 years.

01:11:58.618 --> 01:12:02.970
My daughter, the salon,
now Nancy, my best friend.

01:12:04.232 --> 01:12:05.472
We're gonna find your friend.

01:12:06.452 --> 01:12:07.801
I promise.

01:12:07.845 --> 01:12:09.890
Yeah, but are you
gonna find her alive?

01:12:35.438 --> 01:12:38.179
Leave a
message for Dr. Christian.

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:41.594
Christian, I've called you
three times, where are you?

01:12:41.618 --> 01:12:42.706
Call me back.

01:12:53.586 --> 01:12:55.545
Tessa baby, where are you?

01:12:55.588 --> 01:12:57.982
Why did you
have to go to the police?

01:13:00.288 --> 01:13:02.247
How do you have her phone?

01:13:02.290 --> 01:13:03.509
We were having so much fun

01:13:03.553 --> 01:13:06.904
and you had to rush off
and call the police.

01:13:06.947 --> 01:13:08.360
What have you done
with my daughter?

01:13:08.384 --> 01:13:11.212
I must confess
you forced my hand.

01:13:11.256 --> 01:13:14.041
I hadn't planned on
getting here so quickly

01:13:14.085 --> 01:13:17.349
but you proved to be
pretty damn clever.

01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:19.612
Where's Tessa?

01:13:19.656 --> 01:13:21.397
What have you done
with my daughter?

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:22.528
Well, except for the part

01:13:22.572 --> 01:13:24.443
where you didn't
recognize me at dinner,

01:13:24.487 --> 01:13:26.750
that was stupid on your end

01:13:28.099 --> 01:13:29.492
and pretty nerve
wracking on mine.

01:13:31.494 --> 01:13:33.452
But I guess I have
changed a lot.

01:13:34.801 --> 01:13:38.152
In the 18 damn years
you had me locked away!

01:13:38.196 --> 01:13:39.806
Just leave Tessa
out of this, okay?

01:13:39.850 --> 01:13:42.461
She had nothing to do
with this, nothing.

01:13:42.505 --> 01:13:44.550
She's fine, stop whining!

01:13:44.594 --> 01:13:45.464
Listen, just don't hurt her.

01:13:45.508 --> 01:13:46.596
Don't hurt her, okay?

01:13:46.639 --> 01:13:48.902
I'll do anything, anything.

01:13:48.946 --> 01:13:49.946
- Anything?
- Yes.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:52.602
Yes, anything Jeremy, anything.

01:13:55.213 --> 01:13:56.910
Tessa's here with
me, we're hanging out.

01:13:56.954 --> 01:13:58.477
She's in perfect condition.

01:13:58.521 --> 01:13:59.715
Unless you decide to
go back to the police

01:13:59.739 --> 01:14:01.698
and tell them we spoke.

01:14:01.741 --> 01:14:04.265
Then things could get
very messy over here.

01:14:04.309 --> 01:14:07.138
No, no, no, I will not
go to the police, no.

01:14:07.181 --> 01:14:08.966
Just tell me where you are.

01:14:09.009 --> 01:14:11.447
What's the fun in that?

01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:14.928
Please, please just
tell me where you are.

01:14:14.972 --> 01:14:18.018
Like I said Jess, you've
been very clever up to now.

01:14:18.062 --> 01:14:19.629
I'm sure you can figure it out.

01:14:19.672 --> 01:14:21.413
No, don't hang up.

01:14:25.548 --> 01:14:26.548
Don't hang up!

01:14:55.578 --> 01:14:57.580
Think Jessica, think.

01:14:57.623 --> 01:15:00.408
He took your daughter,
took your best friend.

01:15:04.587 --> 01:15:05.587
Took your career.

01:15:07.981 --> 01:15:09.548
There's only one
thing he hasn't taken.

01:17:50.883 --> 01:17:51.883
Mom, mom!

01:17:56.019 --> 01:17:57.368
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Mom!

01:17:57.411 --> 01:17:59.152
Shh, it's okay,
it's okay, I'm here.

01:17:59.196 --> 01:18:01.459
- Jessica, Jessica.
- Not now.

01:18:01.502 --> 01:18:02.852
Jess he's behind you.

01:18:05.071 --> 01:18:06.464
So you did come alone.

01:18:08.292 --> 01:18:09.292
Let them go.

01:18:10.337 --> 01:18:11.904
It's me you wanna
kill, it's not them.

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:16.082
No, not really.

01:18:17.431 --> 01:18:18.781
What do you mean?

01:18:18.824 --> 01:18:21.305
You blame me for putting
you in the hospital.

01:18:21.348 --> 01:18:24.264
You blame me for
not having a life.

01:18:24.308 --> 01:18:26.005
That's why you're punishing me.

01:18:26.049 --> 01:18:28.355
Don't punish them,
just let them go.

01:18:29.705 --> 01:18:31.576
I don't wanna kill you Jessica.

01:18:32.795 --> 01:18:34.535
That would be letting
you off too easy.

01:18:35.841 --> 01:18:39.323
I wanted you to come
here, not to kill you,

01:18:40.411 --> 01:18:41.586
but so that you can watch me

01:18:41.629 --> 01:18:43.936
kill your daughter
and your boyfriend.

01:18:44.981 --> 01:18:46.286
I want you to live Jessica.

01:18:47.461 --> 01:18:50.595
But live as I do
now, with nothing!

01:18:51.944 --> 01:18:56.732
No career, no family, no
friends, and no lover.

01:18:58.211 --> 01:19:01.519
Okay, okay but you said

01:19:01.562 --> 01:19:04.217
if I didn't involve the police
that you wouldn't hurt Tessa.

01:19:05.871 --> 01:19:07.786
I know.

01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:08.831
I know.

01:19:11.572 --> 01:19:13.226
But nothing has gone
as planned with her.

01:19:14.532 --> 01:19:15.944
I was hoping that
Tessa would've turned

01:19:15.968 --> 01:19:17.317
completely against you by now.

01:19:18.884 --> 01:19:21.408
But I guess the bond
between mother and daughter

01:19:21.452 --> 01:19:22.714
is too hard to break.

01:19:27.588 --> 01:19:28.588
Stop that.

01:19:29.852 --> 01:19:33.899
Leave us alone or I
will shoot you right now.

01:19:35.031 --> 01:19:37.642
No Jessica, really stop that.

01:19:37.685 --> 01:19:39.252
Don't make me Jeremy!

01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:43.213
You couldn't protect
yourself then, you can't now.

01:19:59.272 --> 01:20:01.100
Don't move!

01:20:01.144 --> 01:20:02.406
Police!

01:20:02.449 --> 01:20:03.668
I'm up here!

01:20:03.711 --> 01:20:05.757
Up here, come up here!

01:21:06.513 --> 01:21:08.254
Alright, it's this way.

01:21:18.177 --> 01:21:21.137
Nancy, I am so sorry.

01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:24.531
Oh, honey, honey
stop, it's fine.

01:21:24.575 --> 01:21:25.968
He roughed her up pretty bad.

01:21:26.011 --> 01:21:27.534
Left her by the
highway for dead.

01:21:27.578 --> 01:21:29.841
But your friend is
