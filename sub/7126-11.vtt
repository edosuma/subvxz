I'd rather you do the "I told you so" dance.

11:02.542 --> 11:05.291
Because as you said,
I cannot take care of a dog,

11:05.291 --> 11:07.500
- much less a baby.
- Okay, I get it.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.625
You're mad at me because I was right.

11:09.625 --> 11:11.166
And there it is.

11:11.166 --> 11:14.792
Wow, that did not take long at all.

11:18.959 --> 11:20.542
Hey, everyone.

11:20.542 --> 11:22.208
Todd is right.

11:22.208 --> 11:24.709
You hear that, Chicago?

11:25.917 --> 11:28.917
Yeah, you know what?
I think I'm gonna go out for a while.

11:28.917 --> 11:30.458
Yeah, you know what, you should.

11:30.458 --> 11:32.792
I'm sure everybody wants to see
the guy that was right.

11:33.291 --> 11:35.000
Here he comes, Chicago.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.583
Start the parade.

11:37.583 --> 11:39.333
Oh, crap.

11:39.333 --> 11:42.542
Another plant died. Ugh!

11:45.000 --> 11:47.709
- Where's Sam?
- Oh, I guess she's running late.

11:47.709 --> 11:49.208
You know, new dog owners.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.500
It always takes them forever
to get out of the house.

11:52.917 --> 11:54.917
I guess we're gonna talk now, huh?

11:54.917 --> 11:56.542
- Fun.
- What's with all the stuff?

11:56.542 --> 11:59.125
I thought you were gonna tell the press
you aren't pregnant?

11:59.125 --> 12:03.041
Well, I was going to, but then the stores
just started sending me things.

12:03.041 --> 12:07.542
Look at this bag, $3,000. Gorgeous.

12:07.542 --> 12:09.083
Isn't that a diaper bag?

12:09.083 --> 12:11.750
Not unless it has a diaper in it.

12:11.750 --> 12:13.250
What the hell is this for?

12:13.250 --> 12:14.250
[RATTLING]

12:14.583 --> 12:16.583
Oh, I just figured it out.

12:16.917 --> 12:19.625
Here we go. Martini.

12:19.625 --> 12:24.208
And for the famous pregnant lady,
I brought you a club soda.

12:24.208 --> 12:26.875
- A club what? What's in there?
- Club soda.

12:28.291 --> 12:31.166
I saw you in the tabloids.

12:31.166 --> 12:32.250
No drinking.

12:34.583 --> 12:37.709
All right, that's not gonna happen.
All right, listen up, everyone.

12:38.291 --> 12:42.959
I am not pregnant. I am thin. I am--
I'm very thin.

12:42.959 --> 12:45.041
Take a picture, tell your friends.

12:45.333 --> 12:46.667
Ugh...

12:48.000 --> 12:50.208
Sure, have a sip.

12:50.208 --> 12:51.875
[RATTLING]

12:51.875 --> 12:53.208
[KNOCKING]

12:56.041 --> 12:57.583
- You rang?
- Thanks for coming up.

12:57.583 --> 12:59.250
I'm on hold with one of the shelters.

12:59.250 --> 13:02.250
But I need you to take these flyers
and pass them out, okay?

13:02.667 --> 13:06.375
- You lost your horse, too?
- I had to draw from memory, all right?

13:06.375 --> 13:08.166
You remembered you had a horse.

13:08.166 --> 13:11.417
Hey. I came to see the doggy.

13:13.417 --> 13:15.542
[WHISPERS]
You think she saw me?

13:15.834 --> 13:17.083
[KNOCKING]

13:18.959 --> 13:20.333
Hey, I'm sorry about that.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.125
The stupid door keeps slamming.

13:22.125 --> 13:25.166
Seriously, Frank,
someone's gonna lose a finger.

13:25.166 --> 13:27.750
Guess which one I'd miss most.

13:28.625 --> 13:31.792
Hey, you know what?
Dena, I was just about to turn in.

13:31.792 --> 13:34.709
Oh, I'll just be a second. Where's Baby?

13:34.709 --> 13:37.625
He's out. Like a light. He's sleeping.

13:37.625 --> 13:40.625
Oh, well, he'll wanna see me.

13:40.625 --> 13:43.041
- Baby.
- Yeah, he won't come.

13:43.041 --> 13:44.375
- He's really stupid.
- Shy?

13:44.375 --> 13:45.959
He's shy. He is so shy.

13:46.875 --> 13:49.208
Well, I wanna give him his new toy.

13:49.208 --> 13:51.959
I'm gonna be honest with you,
I have given him so many toys.

13:51.959 --> 13:53.917
But he'll want this one
from his Aunt Dena.

13:53.917 --> 13:56.333
Won't you? Won't you, Baby, huh?

13:56.333 --> 13:59.083
Won't you, Baby? Yes, you will.

14:01.333 --> 14:03.208
He just ran right into the closet.

14:03.208 --> 14:05.500
He's quick.
Did you see him go in there?

14:05.834 --> 14:08.875
Aw, look at that, so cute.

14:08.875 --> 14:10.875
Oh, okay. I'll just take a peek.

14:10.875 --> 14:14.959
No. Just, here, I'll take it.
I'll take the toy. I'll give it to him.

14:15.375 --> 14:19.125
Hey there, you.

14:19.125 --> 14:22.041
Oh! Whoa, was I wrong.

14:22.041 --> 14:25.333
He's-- Really loves-- He loves this toy.

14:25.333 --> 14:26.375
I'm gonna get it.

14:29.041 --> 14:30.667
Oh, boy he's a real fighter.

14:38.291 --> 14:40.125
I won.

14:40.875 --> 14:42.625
So where's the dog?

14:42.959 --> 14:45.625
Oh, he just scooted right on out of here.

14:45.625 --> 14:48.375
- Went underneath the bed or something.
- Oh, okay.

14:48.375 --> 14:50.709
No. Don't look under the bed.
Don't look under the bed.

14:50.709 --> 14:54.458
- Why not?
- Well, because. Oh, boo.

14:54.458 --> 14:57.166
Your Christmas present's
underneath there.

14:57.166 --> 14:59.583
- Really? This early?
- Mm-hm.

14:59.583 --> 15:03.166
Yeah, I saw it in the store and I was like,
"That is so Dena." So I got it.

15:03.500 --> 15:06.667
Hey, look who I found outside.

15:07.333 --> 15:08.542
[LAUGHS]

15:09.542 --> 15:11.041
SAMANTHA:
Hm.

15:13.542 --> 15:15.458
Merry Christmas.

15:18.166 --> 15:20.917
Hey, Regina, can I come in?

15:22.000 --> 15:25.166
I just got a call from your instructor.

15:25.166 --> 15:27.834
And he wanted to lock up for the night.

15:29.834 --> 15:31.125
I can't do it, Howard.

15:31.750 --> 15:34.083
I can't go up in this thing.

15:34.083 --> 15:35.792
Well, let's sell it then.

15:35.792 --> 15:37.709
I mean, it gets lousy mileage
on the highway.

15:37.709 --> 15:40.375
No. We can't sell it.

15:40.375 --> 15:43.417
This plane
was gonna make us do things.

15:43.417 --> 15:46.667
You know, zip off to Atlantic City
for the weekend.

15:46.667 --> 15:51.041
Fly to Bora-Bora, have a massage
from bare-chested men

15:51.041 --> 15:53.750
who fed us mangos
and rubbed our feet.

15:54.083 --> 15:56.375
Doesn't sound sanitary.

16:00.750 --> 16:04.125
I wanted us to be the Newlys
who have adventures.

16:06.458 --> 16:08.250
They're fascinating people, Howard.

16:09.709 --> 16:13.834
Well, you know, we can still do things.

16:13.834 --> 16:18.125
We can sell the plane
and then take a trip to Bora-Bora.

16:18.542 --> 16:21.917
- Really? You'd go?
- Well, yeah, why not?

16:21.917 --> 16:25.458
You get to see one of those fire dances
and get a massage.

16:25.458 --> 16:27.208
From a woman.

16:28.083 --> 16:30.542
Oh, we could, huh?

16:30.542 --> 16:33.834
And we'd have enough left over
to buy a pinball machine.

16:42.125 --> 16:44.208
I win.

16:44.208 --> 16:45.500
I'm so sorry, Dena.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.709
I just took my eyes off of him
for one second.

16:47.709 --> 16:50.542
Well, don't beat yourself up, Sam.
I mean, dogs run away.

16:50.542 --> 16:53.375
That's why we inject microchips
into their necks, right?

16:53.375 --> 16:56.458
I mean, yes we do.
Don't we put things in your neck?

16:56.458 --> 16:59.333
I'm trying to get one into Chase,
but he's a light sleeper, so...

16:59.333 --> 17:00.667
Well, thank you.

17:00.667 --> 17:02.709
- Bye.
- Bye.

17:03.208 --> 17:05.709
Hey. Thanks for finding him.

17:05.709 --> 17:08.083
- Where was he?
- Side street.

17:08.083 --> 17:10.959
Staring into the window of a shoe store.

17:11.250 --> 17:13.583
You know, the thing is
before he got lost

17:13.583 --> 17:16.041
a small part of me
was wishing I had never gotten him,

17:16.041 --> 17:20.917
but then when he was gone all
I could think about was, "Please be okay."

17:21.375 --> 17:23.750
He does sort of grow on you.

17:23.750 --> 17:25.625
Maybe tomorrow
we could take him to the park.

17:25.625 --> 17:27.250
No, I'm giving him away.

17:27.625 --> 17:29.583
What? But, Sam--

17:29.583 --> 17:31.583
No, I'm not ready to feel like that.

17:31.583 --> 17:34.208
Thinking and worrying that much
about something.

17:34.208 --> 17:36.709
I mean, I get lost myself,
like, nine times a day.

17:36.709 --> 17:38.375
I'm already enough to handle.

17:38.375 --> 17:40.875
Well, sure. Yeah, whatever you want.

17:40.875 --> 17:45.208
I mean, it's up to you. Why start including
me in any decisions around here?

17:48.250 --> 17:50.875
Hey, Todd,
do you know where the corkscrew is?

17:50.875 --> 17:54.125
I know we had it
when we snuck wine in the movies.

17:59.834 --> 18:01.959
- What's this?
- Oh, it's nothing. Give it to me.

18:01.959 --> 18:03.500
Baby names?

18:03.500 --> 18:05.333
It was on sale. I collect names. Give it.

18:06.041 --> 18:08.750
You highlighted some. Let's see.

18:08.750 --> 18:10.542
"Cynthia," no.

18:11.834 --> 18:13.208
And "Holden."

18:13.208 --> 18:15.208
Holden Deepler?

18:15.208 --> 18:18.500
Oh, God, I would have no problem
spanking that kid.

18:18.500 --> 18:21.250
I was goofing around.
You said you might be pregnant.

18:21.250 --> 18:22.875
- When?
- Three days ago.

18:22.875 --> 18:24.166
You were gonna take a test.

18:24.166 --> 18:26.625
I did. I passed. No baby.

18:26.625 --> 18:29.875
Wait, you took the test
without me there?

18:29.875 --> 18:32.125
What, you wanted to watch me pee?

18:32.125 --> 18:36.458
Because you know I could direct you
to some websites if that's what you're into.

18:36.458 --> 18:38.000
No, forget it.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.250
No baby, that's all I wanted to know.
It's great.

18:40.250 --> 18:43.375
- Mm-hm.
- I'll just open up the wine.

18:43.375 --> 18:46.291
How about "Gaylord"? Gaylord Deepler.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.834
[LAUGHING]

19:05.041 --> 19:07.375
Here, stay there.

19:09.041 --> 19:12.542
Hey, why are you acting this way?

19:17.542 --> 19:20.750
Because when a guy storms out
of a room, he likes to slam a door.

19:20.750 --> 19:22.166
And I don't have a door.

19:22.166 --> 19:24.291
And you can't slam a couch.

19:26.667 --> 19:30.250
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't involve you in this.

19:30.250 --> 19:31.583
Or anything.

19:32.041 --> 19:33.500
I just--

19:34.250 --> 19:36.875
- I can't play house with you, okay?
- Huh?

19:36.875 --> 19:39.667
It's hard enough living here
remembering we're not together,

19:39.667 --> 19:42.959
then you bring in something to care about
and expect us to act like a family.

19:42.959 --> 19:45.458
And I have to remember
we're not that, either.

19:46.208 --> 19:47.667
See? This is what I mean.

19:47.667 --> 19:49.625
Someone so self-involved,

19:49.625 --> 19:52.291
that doesn't even realize
that you're going through something,

19:52.291 --> 19:54.083
should not be raising a baby.

19:55.750 --> 19:57.375
Yet.

19:58.667 --> 20:00.417
Shh. Don't move, he's sleeping.

20:03.750 --> 20:05.500
[WHISPERING]
Wait. I have to stand here all night?

20:05.500 --> 20:07.083
Yeah. I'll get you a blanket.

20:07.083 --> 20:08.250
No, no, Sam. Sam.

20:08.542 --> 20:10.417
Shh. Don't move. Don't you move.
