Yeah!

00:37.000 --> 00:38.172
It is.

00:38.172 --> 00:41.413
One that's definitely
on the brink of booming.

00:41.413 --> 00:42.413
Come on, pal.

00:43.517 --> 00:46.137
<i>I think this was one of
the first B's to open.</i>

00:46.137 --> 00:47.137
<i>What do you think?</i>

00:48.620 --> 00:49.965
It's gorgeous!

00:51.034 --> 00:53.000
Who knew a B and B
could be so elegant?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.068
<i>What were you expecting?</i>

00:55.068 --> 00:57.862
<i>Something a little more
rugged, knowing your tastes.</i>

00:57.862 --> 00:59.862
I can appreciate a little
luxe every now and again.

01:00.551 --> 01:01.517
What do you
think, pal?

01:04.379 --> 01:05.241
Should we
check it out?

01:05.241 --> 01:06.068
Yeah!

01:11.793 --> 01:12.517
Hey!

01:12.517 --> 01:13.206
Rex!

01:13.206 --> 01:13.896
Come on, pal!

01:14.689 --> 01:16.172
<i>Rex, where are
you headed?</i>

01:16.172 --> 01:17.344
<i>The B
is next door!</i>

01:18.275 --> 01:19.000
Strange.

01:24.137 --> 01:25.172
<i>What is it?</i>

01:28.137 --> 01:28.793
<i>Hey Rex.</i>

01:28.793 --> 01:29.862
Come on pal.

01:45.896 --> 01:48.206
<i>His name
was Eric Gordon.</i>

01:48.206 --> 01:49.137
<i>When did
you get here?</i>

01:49.137 --> 01:50.344
About half
an hour ago.

01:50.344 --> 01:52.068
Did you see or hear
anything strange?

01:52.068 --> 01:53.241
No, nothing.

01:53.241 --> 01:54.482
Rex knew something
was up though.

01:54.482 --> 01:55.344
Oh!

01:55.344 --> 01:56.172
Smart dog.

01:56.172 --> 01:57.517
He's a police
officer, actually.

01:57.517 --> 01:58.206
Rex.

01:58.206 --> 01:58.896
He's my partner.

01:59.137 --> 01:59.758
Partner?

01:59.758 --> 02:00.758
Mm-hmm.

02:00.758 --> 02:02.310
Oh, the famous
Hudson and Rex!

02:03.068 --> 02:04.620
Right here
in Apple Bay?

02:04.724 --> 02:05.310
Um-

02:05.793 --> 02:06.517
we're here to help-

02:06.517 --> 02:07.448
if you need
any assistance.

02:07.448 --> 02:09.482
Thank you,
but we don't.

02:09.482 --> 02:10.724
Outsiders done
enough already.

02:10.724 --> 02:12.586
What do you
mean by that?

02:12.586 --> 02:13.758
Don't take this personal.

02:13.758 --> 02:16.310
But you people come
here full of ideas.

02:16.310 --> 02:17.689
Think you know
what's best.

02:17.689 --> 02:18.482
But you don't.

02:19.482 --> 02:21.413
Eric would tell you
himself, if he could.

02:21.413 --> 02:23.827
Lost his pub when he couldn't
pay his property taxes.

02:23.827 --> 02:25.310
<i>Now it's a fancy
brew pub-</i>

02:25.310 --> 02:27.172
<i>where locals can't
even afford a pint.</i>

02:27.172 --> 02:29.137
<i>That pub is
a second home-</i>

02:29.137 --> 02:30.551
to most of
this town-

02:30.551 --> 02:31.827
going back generations.

02:31.827 --> 02:33.655
It sounds like
a special place.

02:33.655 --> 02:34.862
<i>It was.</i>

02:34.862 --> 02:37.448
Money moves in and honest
folk are forced out.

02:37.448 --> 02:40.517
Those come from aways
who own the B

02:40.517 --> 02:43.068
are as much the
killers as anyone.

02:43.068 --> 02:44.689
Do you think I could
come back later-

02:44.689 --> 02:46.000
and have a look
at the body?

02:46.000 --> 02:48.068
There's no
need for that.

02:48.068 --> 02:49.241
<i>Maybe I'm not
being clear.</i>

02:49.241 --> 02:50.103
<i>But Eric had enough.</i>

02:51.586 --> 02:52.586
He took his
own life.

02:52.586 --> 02:53.655
You may be right.

02:53.655 --> 02:55.172
But something
looked off to me.

02:55.172 --> 02:56.034
Thank you
for the offer.

02:56.034 --> 02:57.275
But this is
my jurisdiction.

02:58.689 --> 02:59.793
I'll take it
from here.

03:09.586 --> 03:12.000
<i>How would
you like to pay?</i>

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Credit please.

03:15.448 --> 03:16.206
<i>Oops.</i>

03:18.206 --> 03:19.034
<i>Let's see.</i>

03:19.034 --> 03:20.689
<i>I've got it in
here somewhere.</i>

03:20.793 --> 03:21.344
There you go.

03:21.344 --> 03:22.137
<i>Great.</i>

03:22.137 --> 03:23.103
Thank you.

03:23.827 --> 03:25.310
Things move slower
here than in the city.

03:25.310 --> 03:26.517
Let us know if
you need anything.

03:26.517 --> 03:27.448
<i>Oh, thanks.</i>

03:27.448 --> 03:28.379
Actually, um-

03:28.379 --> 03:29.827
a good place
to eat nearby?

03:29.827 --> 03:31.379
Ah, we've got you.

03:32.137 --> 03:33.034
<i>We're from Toronto.</i>

03:33.034 --> 03:34.275
Oh, me too!

03:34.275 --> 03:35.551
What brought
you out east?

03:35.551 --> 03:36.793
We were sick
of the city.

03:36.793 --> 03:37.689
Hard to catch
your breath-

03:37.689 --> 03:38.689
with all the
people in Toronto.

03:38.689 --> 03:39.344
<i>You know?</i>

03:39.344 --> 03:40.172
Absolutely.

03:40.172 --> 03:41.137
Sometimes you
need a reset.

03:41.137 --> 03:41.827
Refocus.

03:43.689 --> 03:45.689
How long until you'll know
what happened to Eric?

03:47.862 --> 03:48.793
Uh- excuse me?

03:48.793 --> 03:51.413
Well you're cops, right?

03:51.413 --> 03:52.655
Just curious what happened.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.620
I think the local
authorities are handling it.

03:56.896 --> 03:57.551
Gina?

03:57.551 --> 03:59.310
So a year
from now.

04:00.655 --> 04:01.896
Thanks.

04:04.068 --> 04:06.379
Maybe now we can
finally get our offer in-

04:07.413 --> 04:08.551
on Eric's house.

04:08.655 --> 04:09.275
Ian.

04:09.275 --> 04:10.241
<i>Oh come on.</i>

04:10.241 --> 04:11.724
<i>Dude would've clung
on to it forever.</i>

04:11.724 --> 04:13.103
I'd be up for tearing
the place down.

04:13.103 --> 04:14.137
Building a spa.

04:14.137 --> 04:15.241
You wouldn't?

04:15.241 --> 04:17.551
Eric hasn't even
been cut down yet.

04:18.068 --> 04:18.724
Anyway.

04:18.724 --> 04:19.586
<i>We should-</i>

04:19.586 --> 04:20.275
Right up here.

04:21.344 --> 04:22.034
Come on Rex.

04:22.137 --> 04:22.965
<i>Of course.</i>

04:22.965 --> 04:23.620
<i>Thank you.</i>

04:25.931 --> 04:26.724
Major Crimes.

04:27.620 --> 04:29.275
Oh hi Ethel.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.172
How are you?

04:32.517 --> 04:33.965
Yeah, switchboard's good today?

04:33.965 --> 04:34.724
That's good.

04:34.724 --> 04:35.413
No no.

04:35.413 --> 04:36.448
No, I'm
happy to help.

04:36.448 --> 04:37.758
What do you need?

04:37.758 --> 04:39.000
Well I'm a
little busy.

04:39.000 --> 04:39.862
Actually I'm super busy.

04:39.862 --> 04:40.517
But that's okay.

04:40.517 --> 04:42.586
I have a
few minutes.

04:42.586 --> 04:43.586
Okay yeah.

04:43.586 --> 04:45.689
Is the computer
light on?

04:45.689 --> 04:47.103
Green one?

04:47.103 --> 04:48.724
Okay turn that off.

04:48.724 --> 04:49.379
Yeah that.

04:49.379 --> 04:50.344
Turn that off.

04:54.551 --> 04:55.551
You doing okay?

04:57.137 --> 04:58.931
Still thinking about
the body next door?

05:00.275 --> 05:01.206
No no no.

05:01.206 --> 05:02.103
We're on vacation.

05:02.103 --> 05:05.275
And plus Gina said
she didn't need us.

05:05.275 --> 05:07.758
Well you said something
seemed off to about the body.

05:07.758 --> 05:09.724
Yeah, but I-

05:09.724 --> 05:10.965
I can't put my
finger on it.

05:10.965 --> 05:13.275
But your gut is saying it's
more than just a suicide.

05:13.275 --> 05:14.310
Hmm?

05:14.793 --> 05:16.137
Maybe it's worth
trying with Gina again.

05:16.137 --> 05:17.586
I don't want
to push.

05:17.586 --> 05:19.137
What if you went back
over on your own?

05:19.137 --> 05:21.482
Would she be more
open if it's just me?

05:21.482 --> 05:24.241
And not the famous
Hudson and Rex?

05:24.241 --> 05:25.206
<i>Hey?</i>

05:26.310 --> 05:28.068
Well, I mean you
said it, not me.

05:28.931 --> 05:30.724
What will
you two do?

05:30.724 --> 05:31.620
<i>We could poke
around town.</i>

05:32.413 --> 05:33.551
Get to know
the place.

05:33.551 --> 05:35.448
If it's fraught with
changes as Gina said-

05:36.172 --> 05:37.655
Could be relevant
in Eric's death.

05:37.655 --> 05:38.862
Yeah, what do
you think pal?

05:38.862 --> 05:39.931
You want to
walk around-

05:39.931 --> 05:41.275
and see if that
handsome face-

05:41.275 --> 05:42.620
will get the locals
chatting with us?

05:45.172 --> 05:46.068
I think
that's a yes.

05:47.000 --> 05:47.827
Okay.

05:53.793 --> 05:54.793
Come on, pal.

05:55.482 --> 05:56.586
<i>Let's go for
a little walk.</i>

06:40.310 --> 06:41.000
Yeah I know.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.482
It is beautiful,
isn't it pal?

07:01.344 --> 07:02.137
<i>Come on pal.</i>

07:02.413 --> 07:03.448
<i>Let's go take
a look around.</i>

07:04.517 --> 07:06.310
Let's see what
we can see.

07:11.413 --> 07:12.551
<i>No, I
haven't heard.</i>

07:25.931 --> 07:27.000
Woman2: <i>It's cute!</i>

07:27.344 --> 07:28.034
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

07:28.034 --> 07:28.896
<i>Let's just go.</i>

07:30.724 --> 07:31.586
<i>Come on.</i>

07:31.586 --> 07:32.724
<i>Let's just go back
to the house.</i>

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Come on pal.

07:38.344 --> 07:39.482
<i>Thank you.</i>

07:40.827 --> 07:43.482
<i>Our local doc confirmed that
we're looking at a suicide.</i>

07:43.482 --> 07:44.448
Oh!

07:44.448 --> 07:46.413
I don't mean to step
on any toes here.

07:46.413 --> 07:47.793
But I'd like
to take a look.

07:48.206 --> 07:50.344
Well I've only known
Eric his whole life.

07:50.344 --> 07:52.448
But you clearly
know better.

07:52.448 --> 07:55.758
Yeah, sometimes a second
set of eyes can help.

07:55.758 --> 07:58.103
Sure, but I'm telling
you, Eric was depressed.

07:58.103 --> 08:01.172
And if you're right,
I'll leave you to it.

08:01.172 --> 08:02.689
It'll just take
a few minutes.

08:03.379 --> 08:04.896
By all means-

08:05.827 --> 08:07.000
knock yourself out.

08:11.103 --> 08:14.000
Did the doctor give an
approximate time of death?

08:15.172 --> 08:16.000
No.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.379
Didn't seem much
need for that.

08:18.379 --> 08:19.517
Do you have
an estimate?

08:19.517 --> 08:21.586
Well it's
impossible to know-

08:21.586 --> 08:23.000
now the body's
been cut down.

08:25.137 --> 08:25.793
Why's that?

08:25.793 --> 08:27.448
Post-mortem blood pooling-

08:27.448 --> 08:29.241
usually helps
determine time of death.

08:29.241 --> 08:30.275
Since the body's
been moved-

08:30.275 --> 08:32.344
there's no way
to tell for sure.

08:32.344 --> 08:37.172
<i>Well Eric called me
around four today.</i>

08:37.172 --> 08:38.793
So he must have died
some time between then-

08:38.793 --> 08:40.000
and when you
guys arrived.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.448
What did he
call about?

08:41.448 --> 08:43.034
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

08:43.034 --> 08:44.241
<i>I missed his call.</i>

08:44.241 --> 08:45.793
Did he leave
a message?

08:45.793 --> 08:46.896
Yeah.

08:46.896 --> 08:49.413
Yeah, he said
he wanted to talk.

08:49.413 --> 08:51.862
Probably to complain
about something.

08:51.862 --> 08:52.551
Like I said-

08:53.655 --> 08:55.344
Eric was depressed.

08:55.344 --> 08:56.344
Well that may be.

08:56.344 --> 08:57.034
But here-

08:57.034 --> 08:58.000
have a look.

08:58.655 --> 08:59.517
These indents-

08:59.517 --> 09:01.689
are from the rope
he was hung from.

09:01.689 --> 09:04.448
But they don't
match the bruising.

09:04.448 --> 09:05.655
So-

09:05.655 --> 09:07.551
Bodies don't
bruise after death.

09:07.655 --> 09:08.931
But they will
take impressions.

09:08.931 --> 09:11.241
I think Eric was already
dead when he was hung.

09:12.896 --> 09:14.689
Wait, are you saying that
somebody else did this?

09:14.689 --> 09:15.413
Well look.

09:15.517 --> 09:16.551
<i>These wounds
on his face-</i>

09:16.551 --> 09:17.793
and his hands-

09:17.793 --> 09:19.068
suggest a struggle.

09:19.793 --> 09:20.448
Gina.

09:20.448 --> 09:21.724
This isn't suicide.

09:21.724 --> 09:23.103
It's homicide.

09:23.620 --> 09:25.379
Oh my God.

09:25.379 --> 09:26.862
Eric's wife, Marie.

09:26.862 --> 09:28.034
<i>Eric!</i>

09:28.034 --> 09:29.000
Oh my God!

09:29.000 --> 09:30.896
<i>Just hold
on for a sec, Marie!</i>

09:30.896 --> 09:31.965
<i>No no no
no no.</i>

09:32.965 --> 09:33.655
Just come over here.

09:33.655 --> 09:34.413
<i>Oh my God!</i>

09:41.310 --> 09:42.482
<i>I just
can't believe it.</i>

09:42.482 --> 09:44.241
<i>I'm so sorry you
had to see him like this.</i>

09:47.103 --> 09:49.068
It's not like him.

09:49.068 --> 09:50.137
There must be
another explanation.

09:52.241 --> 09:52.931
Hey.

09:55.620 --> 09:57.517
I understand Eric had
been troubled recently.

09:57.517 --> 09:59.103
Things have been rough-

09:59.103 --> 10:00.000
if that's what
you mean.

10:00.000 --> 10:00.655
But-

10:00.655 --> 10:02.517
he wouldn't do this.

10:02.620 --> 10:04.034
How long were
you two married?

10:04.034 --> 10:05.862
Nine years.

10:05.862 --> 10:07.275
We separated a
couple months ago.

10:07.275 --> 10:09.448
You left him when
he lost the pub.

10:09.448 --> 10:10.896
That's not
why I left.

10:10.896 --> 10:13.413
Well I'm sure it
couldn't have helped.

10:13.413 --> 10:15.862
Eric drank a lot.

10:15.862 --> 10:17.586
He couldn't remember who
he was when he was drunk.

10:19.068 --> 10:20.620
When was the last time
that you saw him?

10:20.620 --> 10:22.103
I see him
all the time.

10:22.103 --> 10:23.206
We had a beer yesterday.

10:23.206 --> 10:24.241
And how was he?

10:25.103 --> 10:26.034
A bit crabby.

10:26.931 --> 10:27.827
But that's Eric.

10:27.827 --> 10:29.413
He was unhappy.

10:29.413 --> 10:31.241
He never would have
killed himself.

10:32.620 --> 10:33.827
Did you two drink
together often?

10:34.413 --> 10:35.448
Sure.

10:35.448 --> 10:36.344
I mean not
as much.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.793
It's different since
we ended things.

10:37.793 --> 10:38.482
But-

10:39.827 --> 10:41.448
why should I care
how much he drinks now?

10:41.448 --> 10:44.896
<i>I still love him,
you know?</i>

10:45.586 --> 10:47.172
Just not in the way
he needs me to.

10:49.517 --> 10:50.379
anymore.

10:51.620 --> 10:53.068
I'm sorry
for your loss.

11:04.379 --> 11:06.413
The town doctor agreed with
Gina that it's a suicide -

11:06.758 --> 11:07.413
But?

11:08.379 --> 11:10.103
But all the forensics
say that it's not.

11:10.862 --> 11:11.551
Here we go.

11:11.551 --> 11:12.241
Oh thank you.

11:12.241 --> 11:12.896
But I couldn't.

11:12.896 --> 11:13.551
Oh come on.

11:13.551 --> 11:14.310
No really.

11:14.310 --> 11:15.689
I'm stuffed.

11:15.689 --> 11:16.448
Okay.

11:16.448 --> 11:17.241
How about you?

11:17.241 --> 11:17.965
Room for another?

11:17.965 --> 11:19.000
I won't say no.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.310
All right.

11:21.689 --> 11:22.344
Thank you.

11:22.448 --> 11:23.068
Thank you.

11:23.172 --> 11:24.103
<i>You're welcome.</i>

11:28.034 --> 11:28.689
<i>So-</i>

11:28.689 --> 11:29.965
how did you
hear about us?

11:29.965 --> 11:30.793
<i>Well-</i>

11:30.793 --> 11:32.448
I saw your five
star reviews online.

11:32.448 --> 11:33.379
And-

11:33.379 --> 11:35.068
<i>Rex insisted we
come check you out.</i>

11:35.068 --> 11:37.241
And have we met
Rex's expectations?

11:39.689 --> 11:40.551
He's pretty satisfied.

11:42.655 --> 11:45.310
How did you two come
to settle in Apple Bay?

11:45.310 --> 11:47.103
<i>It's a long way to come
for some fresh air.</i>

11:47.103 --> 11:49.793
A few years ago a couple
from the mainland-

11:49.793 --> 11:52.344
converted an old
fishing shed into a B

11:52.344 --> 11:54.689
<i>A big feature in
Condé Nast Traveler.</i>

11:54.689 --> 11:56.620
We thought with the right
investment that could be us.

11:56.620 --> 11:57.482
<i>We looked into it.</i>

11:57.482 --> 11:58.206
<i>Crunched some numbers.</i>

11:58.206 --> 11:59.000
<i>And got in-</i>

11:59.000 --> 12:00.034
before the prices
got too steep?

12:00.034 --> 12:00.758
<i>Exactly.</i>

12:00.758 --> 12:01.931
This town
is blowing up.

12:01.931 --> 12:02.689
You know-

12:02.689 --> 12:04.068
from what
little I've seen-

12:04.068 --> 12:07.000
not all the locals are
too happy about that.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
<i>People fear change.</i>

12:09.000 --> 12:10.137
But if you
can't adapt-

12:10.137 --> 12:11.655
then you're
bound to lose.

12:12.137 --> 12:14.172
Time doesn't stop
while people catch up.

12:14.172 --> 12:16.310
If you see an opportunity,
you go for it.

12:16.310 --> 12:17.931
<i>That's how
you get ahead.</i>

12:17.931 --> 12:19.482
And what about the
people that can't?

12:19.482 --> 12:21.137
Well they can find
somewhere else to live.

12:21.137 --> 12:23.448
It's the way
of the world.

12:23.448 --> 12:25.310
So, um-

12:25.310 --> 12:26.448
I met Marie-

12:26.448 --> 12:27.137
Eric's wife-

12:27.137 --> 12:27.827
<i>earlier.</i>

12:27.931 --> 12:28.482
Ex-wife.

12:29.310 --> 12:30.000
Right.

12:32.413 --> 12:33.724
She was-

12:33.724 --> 12:35.172
<i>pretty shaken up.</i>

12:35.172 --> 12:36.000
Poor thing.

12:36.551 --> 12:37.379
Such a shock.

12:38.379 --> 12:40.000
<i>I mean, I
know I sound awful.</i>

12:40.000 --> 12:41.655
<i>But if I
was Eric-</i>

12:41.655 --> 12:43.103
and I was married
to that woman-

12:43.103 --> 12:45.379
I would have offed
myself years ago.

12:47.137 --> 12:47.793
Enjoy.

13:03.620 --> 13:05.000
<i>Alone at last.</i>

13:07.448 --> 13:09.862
I can't believe how open
Angus was about Marie.

13:10.689 --> 13:11.448
Yeah, you met her.

13:11.448 --> 13:12.413
What was she like?

13:13.241 --> 13:14.137
Grieving.

13:15.172 --> 13:16.862
And sure Eric
didn't kill himself.

13:18.103 --> 13:19.448
Aligns with forensics?

13:20.068 --> 13:22.448
He didn't hang
himself Charlie.

13:22.448 --> 13:24.275
Someone strangled him first.

13:24.827 --> 13:27.413
Sounds like we have
a murder to solve.

13:27.413 --> 13:29.103
<i>Yes we do.</i>

13:30.206 --> 13:31.034
First thing-

13:32.344 --> 13:33.724
tomorrow morning.

13:44.965 --> 13:46.310
<i>Jesse, hey!</i>

13:46.310 --> 13:48.793
Your work must be
as riveting as mine.

13:48.793 --> 13:51.068
What- walking Ethel
through a full system reboot?

13:51.068 --> 13:52.931
Yeah it's utterly gripping.

13:52.931 --> 13:54.517
Switchboard tech support?

13:54.517 --> 13:55.413
Yeah.

13:56.241 --> 13:56.862
You know what?

13:56.862 --> 13:57.827
Maybe this little lull-

13:57.827 --> 14:00.000
is the perfect opportunity
for a side gig.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.275
A case study-

14:01.275 --> 14:02.586
<i>of sorts.</i>

14:02.586 --> 14:03.862
Sounds enterprising.

14:03.862 --> 14:07.241
Well I was thinking since you
and I did so well together-

14:07.241 --> 14:08.689
on the last case-

14:08.689 --> 14:11.137
<i>maybe you could
help me investigate?</i>

14:11.137 --> 14:11.862
<i>If you want.</i>

14:11.862 --> 14:12.655
Depends.

14:13.241 --> 14:14.241
What are we
talking about?

14:17.344 --> 14:18.206
Okay.

14:20.724 --> 14:21.931
Here's the thing.

14:21.931 --> 14:25.103
It's more of a personal case
rather than a criminal one.

14:25.103 --> 14:26.517
If you catch
my drift.

14:27.206 --> 14:28.793
I don't, actually.

14:31.172 --> 14:33.068
I think Charlie
and Sarah might be-

14:34.275 --> 14:35.241
you know-

14:36.448 --> 14:37.103
Really?

14:37.103 --> 14:37.758
Yeah.

14:37.758 --> 14:38.862
<i>Huh!</i>

14:40.034 --> 14:41.068
Not sure you have
anything there.

14:41.896 --> 14:42.931
<i>But-</i>

14:42.931 --> 14:44.344
you can run your
evidence by me.

14:44.724 --> 14:45.758
It's going to
cost you though.

14:45.758 --> 14:46.931
Name your price.

14:46.931 --> 14:48.034
Your face.

14:48.034 --> 14:49.310
My face?

14:49.310 --> 14:51.344
Are you some sort of
underground gangster?

14:51.344 --> 14:53.241
Selling body parts
on the dark web?

14:55.517 --> 14:56.655
Practicing facial structure.

14:57.034 --> 14:57.931
Mmmm.

14:59.827 --> 15:01.172
If you sit
for a portrait-

15:02.034 --> 15:02.689
I'll help you.

15:03.931 --> 15:04.862
Okay fine!

15:05.413 --> 15:06.448
You've got
yourself a deal.

15:12.793 --> 15:13.862
<i>Sleep okay?</i>

15:13.862 --> 15:15.034
Like a baby.

15:15.034 --> 15:16.448
Charlie and Rex are
still snoozing upstairs.

15:16.448 --> 15:17.862
Happy to hear it.

15:17.965 --> 15:20.310
Well, one of us
is always here.

15:20.310 --> 15:22.310
So just give a shout if
you ever need anything.

15:22.310 --> 15:24.344
Oh, since you asked-

15:24.344 --> 15:26.620
any chance you heard anything
from Eric's next door-

15:26.620 --> 15:27.448
yesterday afternoon?

15:27.448 --> 15:28.896
Maybe around five?

15:29.689 --> 15:30.310
Nothing.

15:30.310 --> 15:31.000
And-

15:31.000 --> 15:32.034
I was right here-

15:32.034 --> 15:33.517
working on designs
for the kitchen.

15:33.517 --> 15:35.206
So no indication
anything was wrong?

15:35.206 --> 15:37.068
I wish I'd
heard something.

15:37.068 --> 15:37.793
Maybe-

15:37.793 --> 15:39.103
<i>I could have
helped him.</i>

15:39.103 --> 15:41.068
Well if anything
comes to mind-

15:41.068 --> 15:42.689
we'd be happy
to hear it.

15:43.758 --> 15:46.172
I did hear
from a friend-

15:46.172 --> 15:48.034
that Eric went
to the pub-

15:48.034 --> 15:50.275
<i>yesterday afternoon.</i>

15:50.275 --> 15:51.068
Was that unusual?

15:51.068 --> 15:53.551
No but whenever
he did go-

15:53.551 --> 15:55.103
it was to run
off his mouth.

15:55.103 --> 15:56.896
Or get up in
Tom's face.

15:56.896 --> 15:57.793
The new owner?

15:57.793 --> 15:59.103
<i>Yeah, Eric said-</i>

15:59.103 --> 16:02.034
that Tom stole
what was his.

16:07.482 --> 16:08.689
Nice place.

16:08.689 --> 16:10.241
Not sure I'd want
to kill for it though.

16:10.241 --> 16:12.206
If Angus was right and
Eric was here yesterday-

16:12.206 --> 16:13.103
it could be
our lead.

16:20.206 --> 16:23.206
<i>♪Well I'm going to the land
of the great red sand♪</i>

16:23.206 --> 16:26.241
<i>♪Took the ferry
across the strait♪</i>

16:26.241 --> 16:27.310
This wasn't exactly-

16:27.310 --> 16:29.758
how I envisioned things
turning out this weekend.

16:29.758 --> 16:30.413
Sorry about that.

16:31.103 --> 16:31.793
Are you kidding?

16:32.655 --> 16:34.724
Wouldn't be complete
without a case.

16:34.724 --> 16:36.517
Oh do we
need to worry?

16:36.517 --> 16:37.413
Worry?

16:37.413 --> 16:38.172
Why?

16:38.172 --> 16:39.034
Well I mean-

16:39.034 --> 16:41.103
I dated this
co-worker before.

16:41.103 --> 16:41.827
This was years ago.

16:41.827 --> 16:43.655
But everything was fine-

16:43.655 --> 16:45.758
until we realized that we didn't
have anything in common-

16:45.758 --> 16:46.724
except for work.

16:46.724 --> 16:48.137
The only thing you
have to worry about-

16:48.137 --> 16:50.448
is whether you can keep up
with me on our next long run.

16:50.551 --> 16:51.758
<i>Oh you know
better than anyone-</i>

16:51.758 --> 16:52.827
<i>that I can
keep up.</i>

16:52.827 --> 16:54.241
I heard that we had
a famous visitor-

16:54.241 --> 16:55.827
<i>to Apple Bay.</i>

16:55.827 --> 16:56.965
It's Rex right?

16:56.965 --> 16:57.827
Do you
mind if I-?

16:57.827 --> 16:59.310
Actually, um-

16:59.310 --> 17:00.448
<i>he's working.</i>

17:02.206 --> 17:03.379
Are you Tom McGimsie?

17:04.551 --> 17:05.689
Oh this is
about Eric?

17:07.172 --> 17:07.827
Did you know him?

17:07.827 --> 17:08.793
A little.

17:09.448 --> 17:10.172
it's a real shame.

17:11.172 --> 17:12.172
<i>This was Eric's bar.</i>

17:12.172 --> 17:12.827
Wasn't it?

17:12.827 --> 17:14.000
Before you bought it?

17:17.482 --> 17:18.310
Is that a problem?

17:19.103 --> 17:19.724
I don't know.

17:19.724 --> 17:20.655
Is it?

17:20.655 --> 17:21.896
We heard that Eric
didn't want to sell.

17:21.896 --> 17:24.689
Look, I'm really sorry
about what happened to him.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.862
But it's not my fault the
man couldn't pay his taxes.

17:27.862 --> 17:30.517
One man's bad luck -
another man's opportunity?

17:30.517 --> 17:31.310
Right?

17:31.310 --> 17:32.413
Eric was stuck.

17:32.413 --> 17:33.896
Eric resented my success.

17:33.896 --> 17:36.034
<i>That's about all
there is to it.</i>

17:38.517 --> 17:40.137
What happened
to your hands?

17:41.655 --> 17:43.034
I was out back.

17:43.034 --> 17:45.275
I was wrapping hoses.

17:45.275 --> 17:46.448
They broke apart.

17:47.000 --> 17:47.620
Tom.

17:47.620 --> 17:49.137
<i>I suggest-</i>

17:49.137 --> 17:50.862
this is where you
be honest with us.

17:53.206 --> 17:54.000
Okay.

17:54.931 --> 17:55.793
<i>Yeah.</i>

17:55.793 --> 17:57.068
<i>Eric stormed in
here yesterday.</i>

17:57.068 --> 17:58.034
And he was screaming.

17:58.034 --> 17:58.965
And he was cussing.

17:58.965 --> 18:00.620
So I had to
throw him out.

18:00.620 --> 18:02.724
And it might have
got a little bit rough.

18:03.413 --> 18:04.724
Why lie about it?

18:05.275 --> 18:06.068
I'm sorry.

18:06.068 --> 18:07.379
I just want nothing
to do with this.

18:07.379 --> 18:09.137
<i>Okay, Eric and I
were not friends.</i>

18:09.137 --> 18:11.103
<i>I admit I laid
hands on the man.</i>

18:11.103 --> 18:12.034
And that's all
that happened.

18:12.034 --> 18:13.068
That's the whole story.

18:13.068 --> 18:14.103
So if you
think I had-

18:14.103 --> 18:15.137
<i>something to do
with his death-</i>

18:15.137 --> 18:17.310
Nobody is suggesting
that you're involved.

18:17.310 --> 18:18.758
<i>We're just talking.</i>

18:18.758 --> 18:20.000
<i>Did you notice-</i>

18:20.000 --> 18:22.689
anything strange about Eric's
demeanor when you saw him?

18:22.689 --> 18:23.517
Yeah.

18:24.482 --> 18:25.758
I mean, he was
definitely off-

18:25.758 --> 18:27.896
<i>even for Eric.</i>

18:28.551 --> 18:29.896
Something was wrong.

18:32.241 --> 18:34.551
<i>So Eric was depressed
about losing the pub.</i>

18:34.551 --> 18:35.862
Sure, he was struggling.

18:35.862 --> 18:38.758
But all the forensic evidence
tells me that he was murdered.

18:38.758 --> 18:42.206
And Tom said that Eric was more
troubled than usual yesterday.

18:42.206 --> 18:44.206
He called Gina
wanting to talk.

18:44.206 --> 18:46.034
But he didn't
mention what about.

18:46.034 --> 18:47.275
That's what we
need to figure out.

19:07.827 --> 19:09.137
<i>She's alive.</i>

19:10.103 --> 19:10.931
She's just-

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
blackout drunk.

19:14.103 --> 19:14.931
Huh.

19:19.931 --> 19:21.206
<i>So what
can you tell us?</i>

19:21.206 --> 19:22.344
<i>From what I hear-</i>

19:22.344 --> 19:24.379
Lauren can't get over what
happened to her daughter.

19:24.379 --> 19:25.827
What was that?

19:25.827 --> 19:26.758
<i>She drowned.</i>

19:26.758 --> 19:28.758
Like fifteen years ago.

19:29.413 --> 19:31.172
<i>Kendra was
only a teenager-</i>

19:31.172 --> 19:33.137
when a rogue wave
took her out to sea.

19:33.137 --> 19:34.103
Oh that's awful.

19:34.103 --> 19:35.379
<i>She never recovered.</i>

19:36.586 --> 19:37.965
<i>They say-</i>

19:37.965 --> 19:40.034
she keeps her room
exactly as it was-

19:40.034 --> 19:41.275
the day she died.

19:41.275 --> 19:42.965
No wonder
she's reeling now.

19:43.448 --> 19:44.103
Wait wait.

19:44.103 --> 19:44.793
What-

19:45.620 --> 19:46.793
What do you
mean by that?

19:46.793 --> 19:49.931
Eric was sort of her
last tie to Kendra.

19:49.931 --> 19:51.448
<i>They grew up together.</i>

19:51.448 --> 19:52.965
He was even there
when she died.

19:52.965 --> 19:54.448
<i>After that-</i>

19:54.448 --> 19:56.103
Eric looked
out for Lauren.

19:56.103 --> 19:57.275
She'll be lost
without him.

19:57.275 --> 19:57.931
<i>Oh!</i>

20:00.758 --> 20:02.793
What am I
going to do?

20:02.793 --> 20:04.689
He's gone!

20:04.689 --> 20:06.034
Look, once you
get some rest-

20:06.034 --> 20:06.931
you'll feel better okay?

20:06.931 --> 20:07.586
Come on.

20:12.413 --> 20:13.758
<i>It's okay.</i>

20:14.517 --> 20:15.448
We need to talk.

20:16.724 --> 20:18.000
Why are you questioning people
without talking to me first?

20:18.000 --> 20:19.379
You mean the
pub owner?

20:19.379 --> 20:20.034
Tom McGimsie.

20:20.034 --> 20:20.689
Yes.

20:20.689 --> 20:21.379
Right.

20:21.379 --> 20:23.310
Um- we were
at the pub-

20:23.310 --> 20:24.034
for lunch.

20:24.034 --> 20:25.034
And he happened
to be there.

20:25.034 --> 20:25.827
From now on-

20:25.827 --> 20:26.896
we'll be sure to
keep you informed.

20:26.896 --> 20:27.931
Informed?

20:27.931 --> 20:29.344
You should have
asked me.

20:29.344 --> 20:30.896
<i>I know you're Major Crimes
from the big city.</i>

20:30.896 --> 20:31.931
But this is
my town.

20:31.931 --> 20:32.758
My case.

20:32.758 --> 20:34.344
And we respect that.

20:37.068 --> 20:38.241
Thank you.

20:38.655 --> 20:40.034
<i>Gina do you
think you and I-</i>

20:40.034 --> 20:42.482
could take another look
at the crime scene together-

20:42.482 --> 20:44.655
<i>just to see what
else we can find?</i>

20:44.655 --> 20:45.827
All right.

20:46.551 --> 20:47.379
I'm going
to stay here.

20:47.379 --> 20:49.137
I'm going to
chat with Lauren-

20:49.137 --> 20:50.827
when she's feeling
a bit better-

20:50.827 --> 20:52.448
if that's okay
with you?

20:52.448 --> 20:53.724
It is.

20:54.206 --> 20:54.931
All right.

20:54.931 --> 20:55.758
Okay.

20:56.724 --> 20:58.137
You'll call me if anything
comes up right?

20:58.137 --> 20:58.827
Yeah.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.137
Hopefully this will help.

21:10.931 --> 21:11.586
Thanks.

21:15.793 --> 21:18.827
You want to tell me
what's going on?

21:18.827 --> 21:20.000
I'm fine.

21:20.586 --> 21:22.000
You don't seem fine.

21:23.724 --> 21:25.758
Does this happen to you
a lot when you drink?

21:25.758 --> 21:27.206
I had a
bad day.

21:27.206 --> 21:27.896
That's all.

21:30.896 --> 21:33.000
I understand you
were close with Eric.

21:34.103 --> 21:36.758
He was always there
when I needed someone.

21:36.758 --> 21:38.793
Helped out when
I couldn't manage.

21:40.379 --> 21:41.896
He knew my Kendra.

21:44.206 --> 21:46.413
<i>I'm very sorry
for your loss.</i>

21:46.413 --> 21:48.379
Maybe you should
take a little time.

21:48.379 --> 21:50.068
I've got to get back
to work tomorrow.

21:50.068 --> 21:51.448
Property assessments.

21:51.448 --> 21:53.517
I understand the market
is hot right now.

21:53.517 --> 21:55.241
But if you need to
take care of yourself-

21:55.241 --> 21:56.965
I can't.

21:56.965 --> 21:58.896
I'm the City Official.

22:01.034 --> 22:02.172
Can I walk
you home?

22:02.758 --> 22:03.379
Thank you.

22:03.379 --> 22:04.379
I'm fine.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.241
You know-

22:09.241 --> 22:11.758
<i>it's not the same
town as it used to be.</i>

22:11.758 --> 22:13.896
Some of that's
good I guess.

22:13.896 --> 22:16.000
But mostly-

22:16.620 --> 22:18.241
it's plain awful.

22:24.620 --> 22:26.931
Hey, I'm heading
out for a bit.

22:26.931 --> 22:28.793
But Ian is around
if you need anything.

22:30.413 --> 22:31.275
Thanks.

22:42.379 --> 22:44.137
Let's hear this
evidence of yours.

22:44.137 --> 22:46.137
<i>What makes
you so sure-</i>

22:46.137 --> 22:48.517
that Charlie and
Sarah are an item?

22:48.517 --> 22:50.482
Okay well
first of all-

22:50.482 --> 22:51.448
they're together
all the time-

22:51.448 --> 22:53.000
working more hand
in glove than ever.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.034
So?

22:54.034 --> 22:54.896
They're a good team.

22:54.896 --> 22:55.931
Nothing romantic about that.

22:55.931 --> 22:58.172
What about the fact that
I hear them whispering-

22:58.172 --> 22:58.827
closely.

22:58.827 --> 23:00.344
<i>More than once.</i>

23:00.344 --> 23:01.310
<i>And-</i>

23:01.310 --> 23:02.965
they won't even tell
me what's going on.

23:02.965 --> 23:05.172
Jesse, wasn't one
of those times-

23:05.172 --> 23:06.827
because they were planning
you a surprise party?

23:06.827 --> 23:08.206
Yeah, but-

23:08.206 --> 23:09.448
what about all
the other times?

23:09.448 --> 23:10.758
I don't know.

23:11.241 --> 23:12.827
I think you're
grasping at straws.

23:17.137 --> 23:18.758
What about the fact-

23:18.758 --> 23:22.275
that they both decided
to take a vacation-

23:22.275 --> 23:23.206
at the same time?

23:23.206 --> 23:25.103
I mean, that's
pretty suspicious.

23:25.103 --> 23:26.413
They work together.

23:26.413 --> 23:28.448
Naturally they have
corresponding schedules.

23:28.448 --> 23:29.310
Oh my gosh.

23:29.310 --> 23:30.482
They might be
together right now-

23:30.482 --> 23:31.862
on some sort of
lovers' getaway.

23:31.862 --> 23:32.862
Donovan's off too!

23:32.862 --> 23:33.517
Yeah.

23:33.517 --> 23:34.655
But-

23:34.655 --> 23:36.137
yeah.

23:36.137 --> 23:37.517
I guess.

23:37.517 --> 23:38.344
<i>See?</i>

23:40.241 --> 23:41.379
I don't think you
have anything.

23:43.137 --> 23:44.172
Huh.

23:45.965 --> 23:47.482
Sorry if I was
short before.

23:48.206 --> 23:49.068
Nothing personal.

23:49.068 --> 23:50.000
Just-

23:51.034 --> 23:52.827
I know this
place, is all.

23:53.896 --> 23:54.896
Have you always
lived here?

23:55.000 --> 23:55.551
Mm-hmm.

23:55.551 --> 23:56.586
My whole life.

23:56.965 --> 23:59.586
Seems like people really
look out for each other.

23:59.586 --> 24:01.586
Yeah, and we want
to keep it that way.

24:01.586 --> 24:02.275
Here's the thing.

24:02.275 --> 24:03.448
You bring in
city folks-

24:03.448 --> 24:06.068
you open up the door to
a boatload of problems.

24:06.068 --> 24:07.827
Drugs, violence.

24:07.827 --> 24:09.482
Ah, I'm
not so sure.

24:10.000 --> 24:10.827
No?

24:13.103 --> 24:15.275
You're the one who says
that Eric was murdered.

24:15.275 --> 24:16.931
Well not necessary
by a come from away.

24:16.931 --> 24:19.241
Oh I don't know
about that.

24:19.241 --> 24:20.862
Do you have something
on your mind?

24:22.965 --> 24:24.448
Small towns are where
city types come-

24:24.448 --> 24:25.620
to hide their secrets.

24:26.793 --> 24:27.655
That so?

24:27.655 --> 24:28.689
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

24:28.689 --> 24:31.655
Take those two who own
the B for instance.

24:31.655 --> 24:33.172
They're not all they're
cracked up to be.

24:43.068 --> 24:43.689
I know.

24:43.689 --> 24:44.896
Pretty nice, huh?

24:45.758 --> 24:48.310
this place even
backs on the water.

24:49.103 --> 24:50.310
Ah, don't get
your hopes up.

24:51.034 --> 24:52.275
I know, I know.

24:53.241 --> 24:54.103
<i>Hi, you've
reached Jesse.</i>

24:54.103 --> 24:55.310
<i>Leave a message
after the beep.</i>

24:56.517 --> 24:58.344
Jesse, it's Charlie.

24:58.344 --> 25:00.068
Listen, I need you to check
into something for me.

25:00.068 --> 25:01.379
Can you give me
a call back?

25:05.068 --> 25:06.000
Come on pal.

25:10.620 --> 25:11.551
Hey!

25:12.517 --> 25:13.551
How's it going
in here?

25:13.551 --> 25:14.413
Hey!

25:15.000 --> 25:15.862
<i>Gina had to
head back-</i>

25:15.862 --> 25:17.103
to the station.

25:17.103 --> 25:18.620
I think she's warming
to our presence.

25:18.620 --> 25:19.862
Hmm!

25:19.862 --> 25:20.862
You find
anything of note?

25:20.862 --> 25:22.137
No, not yet.

25:23.689 --> 25:25.379
Maybe Rex can help.

25:25.379 --> 25:26.206
<i>Yeah, maybe.</i>

25:26.206 --> 25:27.172
<i>I also think-</i>

25:27.172 --> 25:28.862
Angus and Ian might
be worth a closer look.

25:28.862 --> 25:29.827
Why's that?

25:29.827 --> 25:31.206
Gina implied as much.

25:31.206 --> 25:32.689
Sounds like she
is warming up.

25:33.344 --> 25:34.896
Okay why don't I
go back to the B

25:34.896 --> 25:36.586
see if I can dig
anything up on those two?

25:36.586 --> 25:37.379
Okay.

25:39.034 --> 25:40.482
What do you
think Rex, huh?

25:42.413 --> 25:44.241
There must be something
in here, right?

25:58.689 --> 26:00.689
<i>Are you
sure we're alone?</i>

26:00.689 --> 26:02.586
<i>Angus won't
be back for a while.</i>

26:03.275 --> 26:06.103
<i>God, everything's
just been so crazy.</i>

26:06.103 --> 26:07.931
<i>Don't worry
about that now.</i>

26:09.137 --> 26:10.344
<i>Come here.</i>

26:35.310 --> 26:37.068
I wonder
who took these?

26:58.137 --> 26:58.827
What is it, Rex?

26:58.827 --> 26:59.620
<i>What's in Marie's car?</i>

27:10.551 --> 27:12.793
<i>We didn't
mean to hurt anybody.</i>

27:12.793 --> 27:15.586
Marie reached out
after she left Eric.

27:15.586 --> 27:16.586
It was hard
for her.

27:16.586 --> 27:17.620
Ian listened.

27:17.620 --> 27:19.000
He understood what
I was going through.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.655
<i>We didn't mean for
any of this to happen.</i>

27:20.655 --> 27:21.344
<i>I just-</i>

27:22.448 --> 27:23.344
What about Angus?

27:23.344 --> 27:24.655
I love my husband.

27:25.241 --> 27:25.896
A lot.

27:26.965 --> 27:28.310
<i>But sometimes I-</i>

27:28.310 --> 27:29.310
love women too.

27:30.758 --> 27:31.586
Please don't tell him.

27:32.241 --> 27:33.379
And Eric-
did he know?

27:33.379 --> 27:34.137
No.

27:34.137 --> 27:34.965
We were careful.

27:36.137 --> 27:37.310
Yeah, I can
see that.

27:39.620 --> 27:40.275
Jesse, what's up?

27:40.275 --> 27:41.827
Hey, I got
your messages.

27:41.827 --> 27:43.034
I'll see what
I can dig up.

27:43.034 --> 27:43.965
Give me a
few hours?

27:44.241 --> 27:45.137
Thanks.

27:45.137 --> 27:46.275
Everything okay over there?

27:46.275 --> 27:46.931
<i>Yeah!</i>

27:46.931 --> 27:47.965
Uh- great.

27:47.965 --> 27:48.620
Hey!

27:48.620 --> 27:49.310
Um-

27:50.344 --> 27:51.413
Have you seen
Sarah at all?

27:51.413 --> 27:52.275
Sarah?

27:52.275 --> 27:53.103
No.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.137
Didn't she say-

27:55.137 --> 27:58.620
that she was going to visit
her family this weekend?

27:58.620 --> 28:00.000
Uh- she did?

28:00.000 --> 28:01.137
I don't remember that.

28:01.137 --> 28:02.379
Hmm.

28:03.206 --> 28:04.344
Got to go.

28:12.137 --> 28:12.793
<i>Hey.</i>

28:12.896 --> 28:13.448
Hey.

28:15.310 --> 28:15.965
What's that?

28:15.965 --> 28:17.000
It's a bicycle
inner tube.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.862
<i>It fits
inside a tire.</i>

28:18.862 --> 28:21.482
We found it in the
back of Marie's car.

28:21.482 --> 28:22.655
<i>Rex alerted to it.</i>

28:23.758 --> 28:25.241
Then it must
be important.

28:25.241 --> 28:27.586
Well I think the killer
used this to strangle Eric.

28:38.275 --> 28:40.344
The width matches the
ligature marks on Eric's neck.

28:40.344 --> 28:42.241
And I found traces of talc
like this on his skin.

28:43.793 --> 28:44.413
Marie.

28:44.413 --> 28:46.137
<i>Is this yours?</i>

28:46.137 --> 28:47.517
Definitely not.

28:47.517 --> 28:48.586
I don't even
own a bike.

28:48.586 --> 28:50.344
Then why was it
in your trunk?

28:50.344 --> 28:51.482
It beats me.

28:51.482 --> 28:52.896
<i>Do you really think-</i>

28:52.896 --> 28:54.310
I could possibly do
something like this?

28:54.310 --> 28:55.551
You tell me.

28:55.551 --> 28:56.413
<i>I'm his ex.</i>

28:56.413 --> 28:57.482
I'm not a
psycho killer.

28:57.482 --> 28:59.896
<i>Besides, I was
with Ian all day.</i>

29:00.620 --> 29:01.310
Tell them.

29:01.310 --> 29:02.793
Is that true?

29:02.793 --> 29:03.862
We were together.

29:03.862 --> 29:05.655
Got back here just
before you two checked in.

29:05.655 --> 29:07.413
And you'd be willing
to go on the record?

29:07.413 --> 29:08.517
<i>Make a statement?</i>

29:08.517 --> 29:10.482
But I won't testify.

29:10.482 --> 29:11.689
If Angus finds
out about us-

29:11.689 --> 29:13.137
he'll walk!

29:13.137 --> 29:14.379
I could lose everything!

29:17.310 --> 29:18.379
<i>Easy pal.</i>

29:19.068 --> 29:20.827
So it looks like we
have two problems.

29:20.827 --> 29:21.896
Who killed Eric?

29:21.896 --> 29:23.965
And who tried to pin
the blame on Marie?

29:23.965 --> 29:25.206
This is where it
gets interesting.

29:25.206 --> 29:26.517
Why would someone
want to do that?

29:27.310 --> 29:29.206
Well let's assume
that Angus knew-

29:29.206 --> 29:30.310
that Ian was
having an affair.

29:30.310 --> 29:32.206
That would give him a reason
to want to blame Marie.

29:32.206 --> 29:33.068
Yeah.

29:33.068 --> 29:35.103
Punish her, and
throw the investigation.

29:35.103 --> 29:37.517
Yeah, but what would
Angus have against Eric?

29:37.517 --> 29:39.413
Something big enough
to want him dead.

29:39.413 --> 29:40.689
Yeah, it doesn't
make sense.

29:42.724 --> 29:43.586
Unless-

29:44.068 --> 29:45.137
Unless what?

29:45.137 --> 29:47.896
Do you remember that comment
that Ian made to Angus-

29:47.896 --> 29:50.724
about wanting Eric's property
now that he's gone?

29:52.068 --> 29:53.448
It's just got
me thinking.

29:54.448 --> 29:56.000
About what?

29:58.172 --> 29:59.034
You know what?

29:59.724 --> 30:00.862
Just give me
a half hour?

30:01.758 --> 30:02.689
Okay.

30:04.206 --> 30:04.862
Rex.

30:13.862 --> 30:14.724
Almost done.

30:16.827 --> 30:18.206
<i>How do you feel
about your case now?</i>

30:18.965 --> 30:19.793
I don't know.

30:19.793 --> 30:20.551
I mean-

30:21.551 --> 30:23.517
apparently Sarah's in Toronto-

30:23.517 --> 30:24.448
visiting her parents.

30:24.448 --> 30:26.206
And Charlie's
out of town-

30:26.206 --> 30:27.896
getting some
fresh air with Rex.

30:29.034 --> 30:30.172
You sound disappointed.

30:30.724 --> 30:31.379
I just-

30:31.379 --> 30:32.103
I don't know-

30:32.103 --> 30:33.241
I thought I was
on to something.

30:35.655 --> 30:38.862
Well, I hope this won't
disappoint you further.

30:38.862 --> 30:40.379
Should I be scared?

30:40.379 --> 30:41.206
I'm a little scared.

30:49.068 --> 30:52.896
That is
incredible!

30:52.896 --> 30:53.586
Wow!

30:53.586 --> 30:55.275
You really
have a gift!

30:55.275 --> 30:58.206
<i>I can't take
all the credit.</i>

30:58.206 --> 30:59.344
You're an amazing subject-

30:59.344 --> 31:01.275
with really good
bone structure.

31:01.275 --> 31:03.413
Yeah, it's my grandmother's
cheekbones, I guess.

31:06.413 --> 31:07.448
Can I-

31:07.448 --> 31:08.241
Can I have this?

31:08.896 --> 31:09.551
Of course!

31:15.310 --> 31:15.965
Thank you.

31:16.620 --> 31:17.517
Thank you!

31:22.517 --> 31:23.724
<i>Hey Angus.</i>

31:23.896 --> 31:24.586
You got a minute?

31:24.586 --> 31:25.275
<i>Yeah!</i>

31:25.275 --> 31:26.724
What can I
do for you?

31:26.724 --> 31:27.482
Listen.

31:27.482 --> 31:29.551
Was Ian serious
about wanting-

31:29.551 --> 31:31.275
to put a bid
on Eric's place?

31:31.275 --> 31:32.862
What are you
talking about?

31:32.965 --> 31:34.000
What about yourself?

31:34.827 --> 31:36.241
Wanting to expand
the business?

31:36.241 --> 31:38.068
Buy the adjacent property?

31:38.068 --> 31:39.275
Build a spa?

31:39.275 --> 31:41.379
That was a joke!

31:41.379 --> 31:42.896
I'm not so sure.

31:44.068 --> 31:45.620
What are you
getting at?

31:45.620 --> 31:48.172
Are you suggesting
that I killed Eric-

31:48.172 --> 31:49.689
because I wanted
his property?

31:50.344 --> 31:51.034
Did you?

31:51.655 --> 31:52.793
That's ridiculous.

32:12.862 --> 32:13.862
<i>Sure,
just a moment.</i>

32:14.793 --> 32:15.448
Hello!

32:16.000 --> 32:16.620
Hi.

32:16.620 --> 32:17.655
Is Lauren Humphries here?

32:17.655 --> 32:18.620
I'm sorry.

32:18.620 --> 32:19.620
She's not in today.

32:19.620 --> 32:20.689
Something I can
help you with?

32:20.689 --> 32:22.137
Ms. Humphries
didn't come to work?

32:23.034 --> 32:23.931
Not since Friday.

32:23.931 --> 32:25.655
That's before
they found Eric.

32:25.655 --> 32:27.103
Everything okay?

32:27.103 --> 32:29.413
Yeah can we see the tax
assessments and valuations-

32:29.413 --> 32:30.586
for Eric Gordon's property?

32:30.586 --> 32:32.103
Eric Gordon?

32:32.103 --> 32:33.068
<i>Yeah that's correct.</i>

32:33.068 --> 32:35.206
And could you also pull
the tax assessments-

32:35.206 --> 32:36.827
for his previously-
owned pub?

32:36.827 --> 32:37.551
Sure.

32:37.551 --> 32:38.241
Just a moment.

32:41.172 --> 32:43.103
I remember you talking about
moving out of the city-

32:43.103 --> 32:44.965
when we were on
Avalon Island last year.

32:44.965 --> 32:47.448
Yeah, the vistas,
the fresh air-

32:49.275 --> 32:50.172
Yes buddy.

32:50.172 --> 32:50.931
And the sheep.

32:51.965 --> 32:53.482
You still think you want
to live in a small town-

32:53.482 --> 32:54.172
after this weekend?

32:55.275 --> 32:56.448
The question is whether
or not I could afford it.

32:56.448 --> 32:58.310
Take a look
at this.

32:58.310 --> 32:59.068
Ooh!

32:59.068 --> 33:00.517
I knew Apple Bay
was gentrifying.

33:00.517 --> 33:02.068
But I didn't expect
these prices.

33:04.172 --> 33:06.655
Sorry, but Mr. Gordon's files
must have been misplaced.

33:07.068 --> 33:07.724
They're gone?

33:08.344 --> 33:09.275
It's strange.

33:09.275 --> 33:10.379
Lauren's usually
pretty thorough.

33:12.448 --> 33:13.344
Okay, thank you.

33:15.413 --> 33:16.241
<i>Charlie.</i>

33:17.448 --> 33:20.241
I found an empty folder
from the city in Eric's garage.

33:21.689 --> 33:23.896
That must be the
tax assessments.

33:23.896 --> 33:26.103
Someone wants
them to disappear.

33:26.103 --> 33:28.000
We need to figure out
what Eric was up to.

33:29.172 --> 33:30.103
Come on pal.

33:33.241 --> 33:33.896
Hey.

33:33.896 --> 33:34.758
Did I wake
you up?

33:34.758 --> 33:36.034
Must be lonely
over there.

33:36.034 --> 33:37.310
No no, I'm good.

33:37.310 --> 33:40.034
You know, just
keeping busy.

33:40.034 --> 33:41.000
<i>Good.</i>

33:41.000 --> 33:43.034
Any luck with the status
of Eric's property?

33:43.034 --> 33:44.241
Oh yeah, Charlie.

33:44.241 --> 33:45.793
It's a doozie.

33:45.793 --> 33:46.448
Really?

33:46.448 --> 33:47.275
How so?

33:47.275 --> 33:48.413
The assessed value
of his house-

33:48.413 --> 33:49.758
tripled in the
last two months.

33:49.758 --> 33:50.517
And it was-

33:50.517 --> 33:52.000
<i>very high
to begin with.</i>

33:52.000 --> 33:53.103
What about the
property taxes?

33:53.103 --> 33:54.206
Astronomical.

33:54.206 --> 33:55.827
Yeah, I'll shoot
you the specifics.

33:55.827 --> 33:56.827
Okay thanks.

33:56.827 --> 33:58.034
Um- look.

33:58.034 --> 34:00.241
Anything on the pub
that Eric lost?

34:00.241 --> 34:01.620
Oh, well I
mean yeah.

34:01.620 --> 34:03.137
Property taxes were
huge on that, too.

34:03.137 --> 34:05.551
And the valuation
was through the roof.

34:05.551 --> 34:06.586
Was?

34:06.586 --> 34:07.965
What's changed?

34:07.965 --> 34:09.724
<i>I don't know.</i>

34:09.724 --> 34:10.862
The value of the
pub just dropped-

34:10.862 --> 34:12.172
after the new owner
took possession.

34:12.172 --> 34:13.068
Okay.

34:13.068 --> 34:13.724
Good.

34:13.724 --> 34:14.379
Thanks Jesse.

34:14.379 --> 34:15.827
Is that it?

34:15.931 --> 34:17.206
For now.

34:18.172 --> 34:19.896
Even in a town
on the rise-

34:19.896 --> 34:21.241
a tripled property assessment-

34:21.241 --> 34:23.137
<i>is unheard of.</i>

34:23.241 --> 34:23.931
Yeah.

34:23.931 --> 34:25.620
No wonder Eric
lost his pub.

34:25.620 --> 34:27.034
I think we need
to talk to Lauren.

34:27.896 --> 34:29.965
I think there was something
she wasn't telling us.

35:15.310 --> 35:16.103
Sarah.

35:16.586 --> 35:17.379
Oh!

35:18.482 --> 35:19.413
Here, Rex.

35:20.482 --> 35:22.275
Here, let me try.

35:27.758 --> 35:28.551
She's breathing.

35:29.482 --> 35:30.655
There's no way she
did this to herself.

35:33.241 --> 35:33.827
Rex.

35:33.827 --> 35:34.551
<i>Someone else is here!</i>

35:41.965 --> 35:43.137
Gina.

35:43.137 --> 35:46.137
I need a doctor at Lauren
Humphries' residence right away.

35:46.137 --> 35:47.724
Someone tried
to strangle her.

35:47.724 --> 35:48.448
Okay.

35:49.931 --> 35:51.068
Lauren.

35:51.068 --> 35:52.241
Can you hear me?

35:53.241 --> 35:53.862
Wake up!

35:55.275 --> 35:56.034
<i>Hey.</i>

35:57.724 --> 35:58.551
Hi.

36:00.241 --> 36:01.241
Tell me what happened.

36:03.034 --> 36:05.379
Everything went black.

36:05.379 --> 36:07.241
Who did this
to you?

37:08.137 --> 37:09.310
<i>Ughh!</i>

37:10.310 --> 37:11.310
<i>I'll
tell you what.</i>

37:11.310 --> 37:12.586
<i>I'll give you a chance
to explain yourself-</i>

37:12.586 --> 37:13.793
<i>before I put you
behind bars.</i>

37:13.793 --> 37:14.862
<i>Come on!</i>

37:16.448 --> 37:17.482
So what are you
hiding, huh?

37:18.517 --> 37:19.586
<i>Some kind of deal
with the City Assessor?</i>

37:19.586 --> 37:21.310
She was fudging
the numbers?

37:21.310 --> 37:22.344
That's how you
got the pub?

37:23.379 --> 37:25.931
This place was
choking me.

37:25.931 --> 37:29.172
But he offered
me something.

37:29.172 --> 37:29.965
Who?

37:29.965 --> 37:30.931
Who did?

37:31.586 --> 37:32.551
Tom.

37:32.551 --> 37:33.965
She made adjustments
to the assessments.

37:33.965 --> 37:34.620
That's it.

37:34.620 --> 37:35.344
<i>You mean-</i>

37:35.344 --> 37:36.965
she blew up
the tax rates-

37:36.965 --> 37:39.206
slapping Eric with
impossible bills.

37:39.206 --> 37:40.448
You forced
him to sell.

37:40.448 --> 37:41.896
The conditions
just weren't right.

37:41.896 --> 37:43.724
So I made adjustments-

37:43.724 --> 37:45.724
adjustments to the landscape!

37:45.724 --> 37:47.310
And giving you the first
opportunity at the sale.

37:48.793 --> 37:50.034
But Lauren-

37:50.034 --> 37:51.586
she lowered the tax rates as
soon as you took possession.

37:51.586 --> 37:53.344
That was a pretty
sweet deal huh?

37:53.344 --> 37:55.379
<i>What was in
it for her?</i>

37:56.068 --> 38:00.517
He offered me a 10 percent
commission on all his purchases.

38:01.689 --> 38:03.827
I made more money on
the sale of Eric's pub-

38:03.827 --> 38:05.068
than I had in
my whole life.

38:06.689 --> 38:08.620
<i>But I had
no idea-</i>

38:08.620 --> 38:11.413
that Eric would
take it so hard.

38:11.413 --> 38:13.482
I bet Eric didn't see
a dime of the money-

38:13.482 --> 38:14.379
he got from
the sale.

38:14.379 --> 38:16.620
The creditors
would've taken it all.

38:16.620 --> 38:19.034
<i>And now Tom is
after Eric's house.</i>

38:19.034 --> 38:19.827
I said no.

38:19.827 --> 38:22.172
I tried to talk
him out of it.

38:22.172 --> 38:23.931
You tried to back
out of the deal.

38:23.931 --> 38:25.620
Yeah.

38:25.620 --> 38:27.758
I couldn't keep going-

38:27.758 --> 38:29.862
not after what happened.

38:31.310 --> 38:33.068
So Tom attacked you.

38:33.068 --> 38:35.551
He must have
knocked me out.

38:35.551 --> 38:36.551
The next
thing I knew-

38:37.482 --> 38:38.586
you were here.

38:38.586 --> 38:40.862
But Eric wasn't going
to sell this time.

38:41.965 --> 38:43.137
He knew what
you were up to.

38:43.137 --> 38:44.965
He was going to go
to the police, right?

38:44.965 --> 38:46.103
I tried to
talk to him.

38:46.103 --> 38:46.758
I tried.

38:46.758 --> 38:47.896
But he was
so drunk!

38:47.896 --> 38:49.034
That's why
you killed him.

38:49.034 --> 38:50.068
I punched him.

38:51.344 --> 38:52.034
I punched him!

38:52.034 --> 38:53.379
And he went
out cold!

38:53.379 --> 38:55.413
And that's when
you strangled him.

38:55.413 --> 38:56.482
Huh?

38:56.482 --> 38:59.034
<i>With the inner tube you
found in his garage?</i>

38:59.034 --> 39:00.620
<i>Made it look
like a suicide.</i>

39:00.620 --> 39:02.241
But when you failed-

39:02.241 --> 39:04.551
you blamed
it on Marie.

39:04.551 --> 39:05.758
A cheater-

39:05.758 --> 39:07.137
with an alcoholic husband.

39:07.137 --> 39:09.620
<i>It'd be easy to make
her look guilty, huh?</i>

39:09.620 --> 39:11.551
No regrets there.

39:11.551 --> 39:12.655
<i>But you didn't
stop there.</i>

39:12.655 --> 39:14.482
Then you went
after Lauren.

39:14.482 --> 39:15.655
<i>We found
you just in time.</i>

39:15.655 --> 39:17.068
Rex saved your life.

39:18.965 --> 39:21.275
You should have
just left me to die.

39:21.275 --> 39:23.275
You will get
through this.

39:23.275 --> 39:24.000
Fraud is serious.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.172
But you testify
against Tom.

39:26.172 --> 39:27.931
You could have your
sentence reduced.

39:27.931 --> 39:30.620
It's not that.

39:30.620 --> 39:32.034
I can survive jail.

39:32.655 --> 39:33.310
I'm sorry.

39:33.310 --> 39:34.551
I don't understand.

39:36.137 --> 39:38.206
Kendra was a
good person-

39:39.241 --> 39:40.724
her whole life
ahead of her.

39:42.724 --> 39:43.620
But Eric-

39:44.689 --> 39:45.827
didn't save her.

39:46.448 --> 39:47.310
<i>Oh Lauren.</i>

39:48.482 --> 39:52.724
What happened to your
daughter was a tragic accident.

39:52.724 --> 39:53.655
But I'm so sorry.

39:53.655 --> 39:55.034
It wasn't Eric's fault.

39:56.034 --> 39:57.862
He just stood there-

39:57.862 --> 40:00.000
as the waves
pulled her under.

40:00.000 --> 40:04.931
Watched from the shore
as she disappeared.

40:04.931 --> 40:06.827
He kept on living-

40:06.827 --> 40:09.034
when Kendra was gone.

40:10.517 --> 40:13.482
That coward
deserved to lose.

40:16.206 --> 40:18.620
He just wasn't
supposed to die.

40:23.137 --> 40:24.896
What was I
supposed to do?

40:24.896 --> 40:25.896
I had no choice.

40:25.896 --> 40:27.655
There's always a choice.

40:28.724 --> 40:30.413
Now you're going to go
away for a long time-

40:30.413 --> 40:31.275
because of
what you did-

40:32.344 --> 40:33.931
and all the lives
that you ruined.

40:43.827 --> 40:47.413
<i>Yeah, it's nice to
see justice being served.</i>

40:47.413 --> 40:48.655
<i>Even when
it's on our vacation?</i>

40:54.103 --> 40:55.655
Well, I owe you both
of you an apology.

40:56.793 --> 40:57.448
No no.

40:57.448 --> 40:58.655
Not at all.

40:58.655 --> 41:00.448
Without your help, Eric's
killer would've walked free.

41:00.448 --> 41:02.241
We're happy
to have helped.

41:02.241 --> 41:03.206
<i>I appreciate it.</i>

41:03.206 --> 41:04.758
I really do.

41:04.758 --> 41:05.931
Still, I have
to wonder-

41:05.931 --> 41:07.517
if any of this would
have happened if those-

41:07.517 --> 41:09.379
Torontonians
never arrived.

41:10.379 --> 41:11.655
<i>No offense.</i>

41:12.758 --> 41:13.620
Good luck, Gina.

41:13.620 --> 41:14.689
<i>Yeah,
I hope things-</i>

41:14.689 --> 41:15.931
go back to
normal soon.

41:15.931 --> 41:17.931
I don't know what that
looks like anymore.

41:19.448 --> 41:20.482
Bye Rex.

41:21.413 --> 41:23.034
<i>Thank you.</i>

41:39.379 --> 41:40.758
And don't come back!

41:42.655 --> 41:43.758
<i>Looks like
the cat's out of the bag.</i>

41:44.344 --> 41:45.724
We should
get out of here.

41:46.379 --> 41:47.241

Even if it wasn't

42:25.379 --> 42:26.413

back to work

from Apple Bay.

42:40.931 --> 42:42.206
Oh yeah!

42:42.206 --> 42:43.241
Mm-hmm.

42:43.241 --> 42:46.413
