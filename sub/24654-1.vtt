00:00.929 --> 00:02.390
What do you see here?

00:03.414 --> 00:06.382
Oh the earth

00:07.753 --> 00:09.457
is a gift to us.

00:12.258 --> 00:14.508
A gift for us to cultivate.

00:21.306 --> 00:22.806
And to reflect on,

00:24.762 --> 00:26.262
you gave it to us.

00:27.762 --> 00:33.183
Jehovah, Jehovah, Jehovah.

01:36.613 --> 01:40.780
This all happened because
of a Sear's catalog.

02:17.539 --> 02:20.039
Dad likes it when I do this.

02:30.879 --> 02:31.796
Touch them.

02:50.232 --> 02:51.400
That's better.

03:00.379 --> 03:02.379
Do you have a boner now?

03:07.473 --> 03:11.640
Can you just put it, put
your clothes back on please?

03:28.315 --> 03:30.565
You Jehovah's are no fun.

03:38.938 --> 03:40.834
Do you want to play Stop Time?

03:40.836 --> 03:42.003
I'm smoking.

03:47.177 --> 03:49.323
And since Christ is our
mediator, we conclude prayers

03:49.325 --> 03:51.825
by saying in Jesus name, amen.

03:53.427 --> 03:55.662
Thank you Brother Dagsland.

03:55.664 --> 03:56.496
Good job son.

03:56.498 --> 03:57.343
Would anyone else like

03:57.345 --> 03:58.176
to comment on that paragraph?

03:58.178 --> 04:00.735
I have to go to the bathroom please.

04:00.737 --> 04:02.335
Come straight back, just there and back.

04:02.337 --> 04:03.235
All right then let's move on

04:03.237 --> 04:05.987
to Matthew chapter five verse 27.

04:08.579 --> 04:10.398
You have heard that it
was said that you shall not

04:10.400 --> 04:12.891
commit adultery, but
I say to you that every

04:12.893 --> 04:15.215
one that looks at a woman with lust for her

04:15.217 --> 04:17.565
has committed adultery
with her in his heart.

04:17.567 --> 04:19.344
If your right eye makes you stumble,

04:19.346 --> 04:21.829
tear it out and throw it away from you.

04:21.832 --> 04:23.768
For it is better to lose one of the parts

04:23.770 --> 04:25.784
of your body than for your whole body

04:25.786 --> 04:27.463
to be thrown into Gehenna.

04:27.465 --> 04:29.047
And witnesses for Jehovah.

04:31.948 --> 04:33.287
I'm at Jehovah's place of worship,

04:33.289 --> 04:37.231
I'm on holy ground and
I'm thinking of breasts.

04:38.186 --> 04:39.347
What is wrong with me?

04:39.349 --> 04:40.960
What is wrong with me?

04:40.962 --> 04:42.595
It's because of last night.

04:42.597 --> 04:45.970
She made me drink, she got me drunk,

04:45.972 --> 04:48.323
then she demanded that I touch them.

04:48.325 --> 04:50.075
It's not a sin is it?

04:51.529 --> 04:53.083
It was breast rape, it's her fault.

04:53.085 --> 04:54.668
She breast raped me.

04:56.034 --> 04:59.955
I'm fine with God and I'm gonna
make it through Armageddon.

05:00.799 --> 05:02.922
We have to keep our minds clean.

05:02.924 --> 05:06.772
Because if we dwell on
the filth of this earth,

05:06.774 --> 05:09.897
we're putting ourselves in

05:09.899 --> 05:13.633
a very, very, can you
please take her outside?

05:18.522 --> 05:19.390
Thank you.

05:22.794 --> 05:25.587
And that explains string theory.

05:25.589 --> 05:27.576
Any questions?

05:27.578 --> 05:30.412
No, then it's time for a pop quiz.

05:32.731 --> 05:34.481
Ah yeah, close your books.

05:34.483 --> 05:39.056
No notes, no talking to your
neighbors, you know the drill.

05:39.058 --> 05:41.169
This is not a team sport.

05:41.171 --> 05:44.838
You guys can do it,
come on, I know, I know.

05:46.354 --> 05:49.085
- We just went over everything.
- Hey.

05:49.087 --> 05:50.076
- So if you don't
- Hey.

05:50.078 --> 05:51.717
Know what it is.

05:51.719 --> 05:52.597
Could I borrow a pencil?

05:52.599 --> 05:53.429
- Yeah.
- You must've been sleeping.

05:53.431 --> 05:54.263
Sure.

05:54.265 --> 05:55.775
Thanks.

05:55.777 --> 05:57.611
And voila.

06:00.034 --> 06:01.462
All right, you guys got five minutes.

06:09.414 --> 06:11.331
Adios guys.

06:14.529 --> 06:15.614
Adios.

06:15.616 --> 06:16.446
Hey.

06:16.448 --> 06:17.388
Hey, what'd they say?

06:17.390 --> 06:19.207
They're cool.

06:19.209 --> 06:21.152
They said I should get some Brixton

06:21.154 --> 06:24.486
wheels because they're faster.

06:24.488 --> 06:27.066
Cool, my dad says he'll get me a board

06:27.068 --> 06:30.401
after I memorize the books of the Bible.

06:31.431 --> 06:33.532
What is this?

06:33.534 --> 06:34.722
Is that from Jennifer?

06:34.724 --> 06:35.891
What's it say?

06:37.453 --> 06:40.501
Peter, tell your stupid
friend Gabe to stop obsessing

06:40.503 --> 06:44.299
over Jasmine when Camille
clearly likes him, love Jennifer.

06:44.301 --> 06:45.850
Okay stop lying, what's it really say?

06:45.852 --> 06:49.025
Seriously, you should ask her out.

06:49.027 --> 06:52.246
She might even let you kiss her.

06:52.248 --> 06:55.648
Besides, people are gonna think you're gay

06:55.650 --> 06:56.866
if you don't have a girlfriend.

06:56.868 --> 06:57.792
What about Kien?

06:57.794 --> 06:59.806
Well he's Asian, and Vietnamese

06:59.808 --> 07:00.871
people don't have gays.

07:00.873 --> 07:02.392
There are gay Vietnamese you know.

07:02.394 --> 07:03.753
First of all I don't know

07:03.755 --> 07:05.071
what.

07:05.073 --> 07:09.296
In the 1950s, Khrushchev predicted,

07:09.298 --> 07:11.426
we will bury you.

07:11.428 --> 07:14.058
Joshua, Judges, Ruth.

07:14.060 --> 07:16.607
A free world that is achieved a level

07:16.609 --> 07:18.104
of prosperity and well being

07:18.106 --> 07:21.943
unprecedented in all of human history.

07:21.945 --> 07:25.195
In the communist world, we see failure,

07:26.337 --> 07:28.109
technological backwardness...

07:30.111 --> 07:33.165
Honey, can you turn up the knob?

07:51.443 --> 07:52.304
How long have you been in there.

07:52.306 --> 07:53.722
Oh almost done.

07:55.198 --> 07:58.198
Gabriel is this door locked?

08:00.073 --> 08:01.076
What are you doing with that?

08:01.078 --> 08:03.912
I thought they sold skateboards.

08:16.460 --> 08:20.434
Hello, we are offering the
latest issue of Truth Magazine.

08:20.436 --> 08:22.353
Can I offer you a copy?

08:28.335 --> 08:29.253
They don't have to be mean and bad,

08:29.255 --> 08:30.518
we're just trying to help them.

08:30.520 --> 08:32.153
I love your attitude.

08:32.155 --> 08:34.673
You really care about worldly people.

08:34.674 --> 08:38.357
Jasmine, do you love me like I love you?

08:38.360 --> 08:41.982
A wind from God lifts up her dress and lets

08:41.985 --> 08:44.821
me see the small beauty
mark on her lower thigh.

08:44.823 --> 08:46.926
Gabe, why don't you take
the next door with me.

08:46.928 --> 08:50.510
And Jasmine you can go with Sister Sorisho.

08:51.928 --> 08:54.163
So you guys getting a new house?

08:54.165 --> 08:57.531
Observe your technique.

08:59.192 --> 09:01.109
Just a second!

09:02.020 --> 09:03.237
Hello there, how are you today?

09:03.239 --> 09:05.058
Have you ever considered that you

09:05.060 --> 09:07.588
could live forever in paradise earth?

09:07.590 --> 09:10.435
In this copy of the latest Truth Magazine,

09:10.437 --> 09:13.204
it shows how we can all
live forever in paradise.

09:13.206 --> 09:15.172
Can we offer you a copy?

09:15.174 --> 09:16.006
Thanks.

09:17.103 --> 09:18.186
Thank you.

09:20.786 --> 09:21.981
Have a great day.

09:21.983 --> 09:22.816
You too.

09:27.143 --> 09:28.163
We preach to give people

09:28.165 --> 09:30.500
salvation and to find souls who are

09:30.502 --> 09:33.502
searching for the truth about Jesus.

09:35.516 --> 09:36.523
Do you need more room?

09:36.525 --> 09:37.357
Oh.

09:44.207 --> 09:46.109
My salvation was sitting right next to me.

09:46.111 --> 09:49.963
She emanated the scent
of a fragrant perfume.

09:49.965 --> 09:53.465
The breeze blew her hair onto my shoulder.

09:58.039 --> 10:00.207
If I could only stop time.

10:01.160 --> 10:02.558
It's called Stop Time.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.643
Touch my fingers and close your eyes,

10:10.644 --> 10:13.226
now we can go anywhere we want.

10:26.981 --> 10:28.560
Hey Gabe, why don't you come sit up front.

10:28.562 --> 10:32.062
I'll take you to see Bill, my Bible study.

10:39.789 --> 10:40.622
All right.

10:53.303 --> 10:55.224
Do you see that house there?

10:55.226 --> 10:57.444
Now they told us to never come back again.

10:57.446 --> 10:59.517
But after Armageddon, a Jehovah's Witness

10:59.519 --> 11:01.686
can move right in there.

11:01.688 --> 11:02.843
Can even be your family.

11:11.614 --> 11:13.594
Did you know that the Bible actually

11:13.596 --> 11:16.013
mentions the sport of tennis?

11:17.661 --> 11:19.963
Moses served in the court of Pharaoh.

11:19.965 --> 11:20.882
You get it.

11:25.111 --> 11:29.279
Right in the court of Pharaoh,
it means different things.

11:31.452 --> 11:33.912
Let's go over last week's study.

11:33.914 --> 11:35.406
What is the world?

11:35.408 --> 11:38.430
The world is the people that

11:38.432 --> 11:40.370
are not Jehovah's Witnesses.

11:40.372 --> 11:42.677
Very good, and who's
the ruler of the world?

11:42.679 --> 11:44.691
Satan.

11:44.693 --> 11:47.067
Can you give me a
scripture to back that up.

11:47.069 --> 11:48.819
1 John 5:19.

11:53.168 --> 11:54.374
That's excellent.

11:54.376 --> 11:56.266
You're on your way to
becoming a Jehovah's Witness.

11:56.268 --> 11:58.748
Now if we aren't for God, who are we for?

11:58.750 --> 12:02.185
We're for Satan, and against God.

12:02.187 --> 12:04.633
That's very good Bill, that's very good.

12:04.635 --> 12:08.052
Now are you for God or are you for Satan?

12:14.824 --> 12:18.407
Bill, are you for God or are you for Satan?

12:21.226 --> 12:22.476
I hate Satan,

12:24.784 --> 12:26.284
but I'm for Satan.

12:27.827 --> 12:29.839
What are you talking about?

12:29.841 --> 12:32.382
I mean I might be for God
now, it's been four days.

12:32.384 --> 12:34.301
Four days since what?

12:37.443 --> 12:38.610
I got drunk.

12:42.698 --> 12:44.300
And have you been praying to Jehovah

12:44.302 --> 12:46.801
to help you quit that dirty habit?

12:46.803 --> 12:49.393
I have been praying but on Tuesday I sinned

12:49.395 --> 12:53.562
and I thought since I'm for
Satan I should do Satan things.

12:57.203 --> 13:01.371
But you asked for Jehovah's
forgiveness in prayer, right?

13:02.981 --> 13:06.341
So you're doing the right thing Bill.

13:06.343 --> 13:07.260
What is it.

13:09.194 --> 13:13.672
I'm for God.

13:13.674 --> 13:15.994
I'm for God, I'm for God!

13:15.996 --> 13:20.163
I'm for God, I'm for God, I try, I try.

13:26.425 --> 13:30.149
Bill, is there something
more you want to tell us?

13:30.151 --> 13:32.276
It's okay Bill, you can tell us,

13:32.278 --> 13:34.018
you can confess to us right here.

13:34.020 --> 13:37.602
We're all brothers here you can talk to us.

13:39.757 --> 13:41.007
Masturbation.

13:44.187 --> 13:45.354
I masturbated.

14:03.317 --> 14:07.484
Gabe, Gabe, how do you deal
with your sexual desire?

14:09.055 --> 14:10.722
I pray to Jehovah.

14:11.595 --> 14:12.797
And does Jehovah direct you?

14:12.799 --> 14:14.799
Yes, trust in Jehovah.

14:17.949 --> 14:20.521
Have trust in Jehovah.

14:40.433 --> 14:41.886
Uncle Jeff told dad he wanted

14:41.888 --> 14:44.533
to come back to the Kingdom Hall.

14:44.535 --> 14:47.161
He's a musician so he tours a lot.

14:47.163 --> 14:50.343
He also smokes a lot and drinks a lot.

14:50.345 --> 14:53.497
And does a lot of other things.

14:53.499 --> 14:56.199
And if he keeps having sex with girls,

14:56.201 --> 14:58.518
he's gonna die at Armageddon.

15:21.683 --> 15:22.513
Can I take a sip?

15:22.515 --> 15:23.907
Help yourself.

15:23.909 --> 15:25.241
Thanks.

15:28.928 --> 15:29.830
Warms you up huh?

15:29.832 --> 15:31.485
Yeah.

15:33.739 --> 15:35.115
Puts hair on your chest.

15:35.117 --> 15:36.617
Oh shit man sorry.

15:38.487 --> 15:40.250
It's okay.

15:40.252 --> 15:44.169
It's easier to quit
women than it is smoking.

15:45.433 --> 15:46.821
Yeah I have girl problems too.

15:46.823 --> 15:49.216
Tell me 'bout it kiddo.

15:49.218 --> 15:52.148
Well her name's Jasmine.

15:52.150 --> 15:55.568
She doesn't like me but, her sister does.

15:57.355 --> 15:58.413
Peter says I should go with Camille

15:58.415 --> 16:02.556
because she might kiss me, but
what if Jasmine likes me too?

16:02.558 --> 16:05.037
Would she get mad if I kiss Camille?

16:05.039 --> 16:07.989
Relax, in a few years
they'll all be begging

16:07.991 --> 16:11.301
to hang out with you and
you'll forget all about Jasmine.

16:11.303 --> 16:13.451
Don't tell Dad.

16:13.453 --> 16:14.953
It's between us.

16:20.222 --> 16:23.446
What's it like being a rock star?

16:23.448 --> 16:25.048
It's fun.

16:25.050 --> 16:29.954
First, everything get a
little bit blurry on the road.

16:29.956 --> 16:32.859
Do you have lots of sex?

16:38.711 --> 16:42.044
I'm not drunk enough to tell you that.

16:47.216 --> 16:48.383
Worldly girls,

16:52.117 --> 16:54.367
some of them have diseases.

16:57.494 --> 17:00.152
They tested me for Syphilis twice man.

17:00.154 --> 17:04.321
Getting that tube up my
piss hole was not worth it.

17:07.740 --> 17:10.023
Basically that's my motto in life.

17:10.026 --> 17:12.448
Do all that you can unless it gets you

17:12.450 --> 17:14.534
a tube up your piss hole.

17:24.805 --> 17:28.222
It's three chords and the truth they say.

17:34.830 --> 17:38.856
♪ Time on my hands ♪

17:38.858 --> 17:43.791

18:07.509 --> 18:10.176

18:21.387 --> 18:24.177
Did you tell her you love her?

18:24.179 --> 18:26.770
It just says I want to go with her.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.688
She's gonna love you.

18:36.636 --> 18:37.764
Oh there's Tony and Tom.

18:37.766 --> 18:38.933
Yeah.

18:52.688 --> 18:53.855
Hey Fiddie, hey.

18:53.857 --> 18:55.223
How's goofy foot coming along?

18:55.225 --> 18:56.321
Hey come on.

18:56.323 --> 18:58.082
Hey man how come you're always

18:58.084 --> 18:59.039
wearing that old man's watch?

18:59.041 --> 19:00.964
It's cool, it was my grandpa's.

19:00.966 --> 19:03.090
Next time tell him to get you a Swatch.

19:03.092 --> 19:05.394
He died in Vietnam.

19:05.396 --> 19:06.723
Did he live there?

19:06.725 --> 19:10.127
He jumped on a grenade,
he saved like 50 people.

19:10.129 --> 19:13.799
He died protecting his squad, he's a hero.

19:13.801 --> 19:15.167
Yeah dude.

19:15.169 --> 19:16.102
He was a real hero.

19:16.104 --> 19:17.521
That's so cool.

19:36.321 --> 19:37.215
Let's bash cars.

19:37.217 --> 19:38.050
Cool.

19:48.864 --> 19:50.969
It was Nerf football terrorism.

19:50.971 --> 19:52.216
Peter and I had to do crazy things

19:52.218 --> 19:53.903
like this so we could have stories

19:53.905 --> 19:56.238
for our wives in the future.

20:02.579 --> 20:03.545
We're gonna have barbecues

20:03.547 --> 20:06.012
in between having sex with our wives.

20:10.427 --> 20:15.046
All right, dude I have to
ask, have you touched it?

20:15.048 --> 20:17.855
You just gave it to me?

20:17.857 --> 20:18.690
No, it.

20:22.104 --> 20:22.938
Your dick.

20:27.247 --> 20:28.081
No.

20:32.669 --> 20:35.058
I've played with it.

20:35.060 --> 20:36.310
What's it like?

20:37.868 --> 20:40.451
I know you've played with it.

20:42.204 --> 20:43.501
You won't tell on me?

20:43.503 --> 20:46.169
No, I'm not gonna tell on you.

20:47.532 --> 20:49.588
But, look I was thinking.

20:49.590 --> 20:52.463
Isn't like as long as we try not to do it

20:52.465 --> 20:54.381
then it's enough right.

20:56.012 --> 20:58.845
Yeah because we can always stop.

21:01.411 --> 21:04.495
Can we stop talking 'bout this now?

21:05.659 --> 21:07.721
I hear cars, come on.

21:07.723 --> 21:09.390
Ready, go.

21:12.200 --> 21:13.200
Oh!

21:18.749 --> 21:19.999
Hi.

21:21.641 --> 21:22.475
Hey.

21:53.557 --> 21:55.557
I, I should go.

21:57.210 --> 21:58.753
Okay.

21:58.755 --> 22:01.344
I have class.

22:01.346 --> 22:03.742
See you tomorrow?

22:03.744 --> 22:04.994
Yeah, see ya.

22:15.389 --> 22:16.222
Hey, hey.

22:17.246 --> 22:18.214
What's wrong man?

22:18.216 --> 22:19.799
Jennifer.

22:23.489 --> 22:24.739
Wait.

22:26.210 --> 22:28.696
Why is she gonna tell her dad?

22:28.698 --> 22:31.053
I would do anything for her,

22:31.055 --> 22:32.238
why would she want to get me in trouble?

22:32.240 --> 22:33.573
What'd you do?

22:35.803 --> 22:36.803
We kissed.

22:44.754 --> 22:45.587
Hey Dad.

22:47.120 --> 22:48.620
We need it talk.

22:56.383 --> 22:58.383
To Camille, from Gabe.

22:59.965 --> 23:01.965
Will you go out with me?

23:07.384 --> 23:09.384
Did you touch this girl?

23:16.798 --> 23:19.257
Gabe, let me explain something to you.

23:19.259 --> 23:21.917
If you tell me the
truth, right now, Jehovah

23:21.919 --> 23:24.010
and the elders will
consider it a confession

23:24.012 --> 23:26.928
and it will be much better for you.

23:28.132 --> 23:30.132
Did you touch this girl?

23:34.165 --> 23:36.498
Five, four, three, two, one.

23:38.594 --> 23:40.205
Did you touch her?

23:40.207 --> 23:41.124
Yes, yes.

23:45.666 --> 23:46.690
Yes what?

23:46.692 --> 23:48.025
I touched her.

23:55.319 --> 23:59.925
You know that I can lose
my position as an elder?

23:59.927 --> 24:01.927
Where did you touch her?

24:03.505 --> 24:04.638
Where did you touch her?

24:04.640 --> 24:06.509
I touched her on the bench near the gym.

24:06.511 --> 24:10.886
No, did you touch her vagina,
did you touch her breasts?

24:10.888 --> 24:11.718
No.

24:11.720 --> 24:13.048
Gabe do not lie to me.

24:13.050 --> 24:15.996
No, no, we held hands, we just held hands.

24:15.998 --> 24:16.915
Please!

24:16.917 --> 24:18.715
We held hands that's all we did.

24:18.717 --> 24:19.811
Are you telling the truth?

24:19.813 --> 24:20.765
Yes.

24:20.767 --> 24:22.029
If I call Camille on the
phone what will she say to me?

24:22.031 --> 24:23.157
Call here.

24:23.159 --> 24:24.184
What will she say to me?

24:24.186 --> 24:25.359
Dad we just held hands, that's all we did.

24:25.361 --> 24:26.525
Did you kiss her mouth?

24:26.527 --> 24:27.359
No.

24:27.361 --> 24:28.192
Did you touch her breasts?

24:28.194 --> 24:29.024
No!

24:29.026 --> 24:29.858
Did she touch you?

24:29.860 --> 24:31.124
No!

24:31.126 --> 24:33.666
Gabe, I need to know.

24:33.668 --> 24:34.958
I just...

24:34.960 --> 24:36.741
This is a confession.

24:36.743 --> 24:38.109
I just touched her hand dad.

24:38.111 --> 24:39.207
Promise me?

24:39.209 --> 24:40.109
Yes.

24:40.111 --> 24:41.080
Look at me.

24:41.082 --> 24:41.915
Yes.

24:53.401 --> 24:56.485
I needed to know, I needed to know.

25:01.192 --> 25:03.222
I do it because I love you Gabe.

25:03.224 --> 25:04.807
I love this family.

25:07.078 --> 25:11.245
You know all we have to do
is follow a few basic rules.

25:12.295 --> 25:14.007
Abide by a few basic
rules that Jehovah gives us

25:14.009 --> 25:17.494
and we can live together
forever as a family.

25:17.496 --> 25:19.192
Don't you want that?

25:19.194 --> 25:20.027
You do.

25:21.622 --> 25:22.648
Yeah.

25:22.650 --> 25:27.217
I want to see you thrive, okay kiddo?

25:27.219 --> 25:29.810
Okay, I'll get there.

25:29.812 --> 25:33.978
Okay so, why don't you read
to me out of the youth book

25:35.840 --> 25:39.261
and then we'll go outside
and you can teach me

25:39.263 --> 25:42.984
how to use one of those skateboards.

25:42.986 --> 25:44.761
I'm not, I'm not in
trouble with the elders?

25:44.763 --> 25:47.429
No, not for holding hands, no.

25:51.497 --> 25:54.898
But holding hands, that leads to kissing,

25:54.900 --> 25:56.516
that leads to fondling, fornication,

25:56.518 --> 25:58.370
and you do those things
before you're married

25:58.372 --> 25:59.906
and you'll be disfellowshipped

25:59.908 --> 26:02.785
and Jehovah will kill you at Armageddon

26:02.787 --> 26:05.036
and your mother and I will
be in a different place

26:05.038 --> 26:07.451
and you'll be gone forever.

26:07.453 --> 26:09.536
Can you control yourself?

26:10.397 --> 26:11.230
Yeah.

26:12.720 --> 26:14.842
You know Jehovah's watching you.

26:14.844 --> 26:16.282
I know.

26:16.284 --> 26:17.534
Stay with us.

26:26.959 --> 26:29.407
Every serious statistical
study that we have

26:29.409 --> 26:33.687
shows clearly that at least
95% of boys and young men

26:33.689 --> 26:37.069
between 13 and 25 years of
age, pass through periods

26:37.071 --> 26:39.915
of habitual masturbation
of varying lengths.

26:39.917 --> 26:42.708
Some people say that
these figure prove normalcy

26:42.710 --> 26:45.389
and that the absence of masturbation

26:45.391 --> 26:47.929
in a healthy youth is a matter of concern.

26:47.931 --> 26:50.531
Now what do you think?

26:50.533 --> 26:54.699
Before I was baptized, I
had absolutely no morals.

26:56.332 --> 26:57.832
I smoked, I drank,

27:01.338 --> 27:03.088
I masturbated, a lot.

27:05.542 --> 27:06.789
Now was there anything that you were not

27:06.791 --> 27:08.856
allowed to do as a child?

27:08.858 --> 27:12.691
Oh well, a normal thing
is that, it would be

27:18.197 --> 27:20.463
a little embarrassing to talk about.

27:20.465 --> 27:21.548
Masturbate.

27:23.456 --> 27:25.757
When I became a Jehovah's witness,

27:25.759 --> 27:28.342
I began to lead a healthy life.

27:31.714 --> 27:35.834
A life free of disease, free
of any of the evil things

27:35.836 --> 27:40.696
that disappear when you
accept Jehovah as your God.

27:40.698 --> 27:43.428
How long are you grounded for?

27:43.430 --> 27:45.197
Thursday.

27:45.199 --> 27:48.255
Do you think you'll ever
get back together with her?

27:48.257 --> 27:51.757
Not really, she's not really interested.

27:55.044 --> 27:59.324
It sucks but we can find more
girls at assembly I guess.

27:59.326 --> 28:00.826
Yeah, it's cool.

28:02.802 --> 28:04.184
When we're 18 we'll both be married

28:04.186 --> 28:05.675
and we'll have barbecues.

28:05.677 --> 28:06.827
And sex.

28:06.829 --> 28:07.763
Lots of sex.

28:07.765 --> 28:08.685
Lots of barbecues.

28:08.687 --> 28:09.692
Lots of barbecues.

28:09.694 --> 28:10.661
Barbecue sex.

28:10.663 --> 28:11.719
Barbecue sex.

28:11.721 --> 28:13.017
Barbecue sex.

28:13.019 --> 28:14.458
Peter who are you talking to in there?

28:14.460 --> 28:16.173
No one Terry, I was

28:16.175 --> 28:18.063
just memorizing Bible scriptures.

28:18.065 --> 28:19.399
I'm coming in.

28:22.543 --> 28:23.838
You're memorizing Bible verses.

28:23.840 --> 28:24.673
Yeah.

28:28.486 --> 28:32.387
Okay well that's a good way
to spend your time grounded.

28:32.389 --> 28:35.112
What do you say we make it one day

28:35.114 --> 28:36.894
grounded instead of five all right?

28:36.896 --> 28:37.729
Okay.

28:38.860 --> 28:40.776
Call me, call me dad.

28:41.921 --> 28:43.005
Thanks Dad.

28:49.252 --> 28:50.313
Close one.

28:50.315 --> 28:51.250
Good job.

28:51.252 --> 28:52.330
That was close.

28:52.332 --> 28:54.748
That was very close.

28:57.444 --> 28:58.274
You better go.

28:58.276 --> 29:00.398
Yeah, why does he want you calling him dad?

29:00.400 --> 29:04.150
'Cause my real dad's getting out of prison.

29:06.665 --> 29:08.245
You think you're gonna see him?

29:08.247 --> 29:10.081
No, I don't want to.

29:15.321 --> 29:16.615
I'll see you later.

29:51.935 --> 29:52.765
Hi.

29:52.767 --> 29:54.226
Hey.

29:54.228 --> 29:57.020
Where are your Bible study books.

29:57.022 --> 29:58.260
Under there.

29:58.262 --> 30:00.260
Put 'em up on the shelf.

30:00.262 --> 30:03.138
We're the illuminators of God's word,

30:03.140 --> 30:05.463
you want to set a good example right,

30:05.465 --> 30:06.774
for your aunt, for your cousin.

30:06.776 --> 30:10.829
Yeah, but Karen's always making fun of me.

30:10.831 --> 30:13.238
We don't want her to die,
do we want her to live?

30:13.240 --> 30:14.839
Yeah.

30:14.841 --> 30:16.839
Well it's just it says in the truth,

30:16.841 --> 30:18.711
we set examples to those worldly people

30:18.713 --> 30:21.250
and then they can have salvation like us.

30:24.798 --> 30:27.697
Thank you, button your shirt up please.

30:32.526 --> 30:34.442
So my friend had the coolest
birthday party last week.

30:34.444 --> 30:38.361
Oh, I forgot, you don't
go to parties, why not?

30:41.860 --> 30:44.740
'Cause it says it in the Bible.

30:44.742 --> 30:47.457
Hey, you like Journey?

30:47.459 --> 30:49.042
- Yeah.
- They're from San Francisco.

30:49.044 --> 30:50.263
Mom bought me their record.

30:50.265 --> 30:53.484
I play it on the record player
she gave me for Christmas.

30:53.486 --> 30:56.902
Oh, right, you don't celebrate Christmas.

30:59.101 --> 31:00.351
That must suck.

31:01.208 --> 31:05.724
Yeah but I'm doing what God
wants me to do, you're not.

31:05.726 --> 31:08.551
So you better watch out for Armageddon.

31:08.553 --> 31:12.136
How do you know what God wants you to do?

31:14.329 --> 31:17.079
Because I read it in the Bible.

31:20.595 --> 31:24.246
Well where does it say you
can't celebrate Christmas?

31:24.248 --> 31:25.686
I don't know, but I'll ask dad.

31:25.688 --> 31:27.918
Mom says he gives too much money

31:27.920 --> 31:30.186
to the Jehovah people so he stays poor.

31:30.188 --> 31:32.238
Mom says Aunt Lynn is a Jehovah

31:32.240 --> 31:34.346
because she has voids in her life.

31:34.348 --> 31:35.983
My mom doesn't have voids.

31:35.985 --> 31:38.318
Guys dinner's ready!

31:42.196 --> 31:45.828
Hi, we made it, hi how are you, oh my gosh.

31:45.830 --> 31:47.647
Hey Uncle Allen.

31:47.649 --> 31:50.149
Oh you first, we made it, hi

31:51.446 --> 31:52.779
Gabe we made it.

31:55.477 --> 31:56.727
Hi Aunt Lynn.

31:57.708 --> 31:59.363
Look at you, you're so big.

31:59.365 --> 32:00.948
You remember Karen.

32:01.923 --> 32:02.820
Hey.

32:02.822 --> 32:03.937
What's up.

32:03.939 --> 32:05.142
You guys hug or something, you haven't

32:05.144 --> 32:06.256
seen each other in five years.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.488
Awkward teenagers.

32:08.490 --> 32:10.657
You got anything to drink?

32:18.631 --> 32:19.796
Where's the TV?

32:19.798 --> 32:23.965
Dad, he put it away, he
says I watch it too much.

32:25.003 --> 32:26.086
That's gay.

32:31.774 --> 32:33.440
I'm getting a drink.

32:36.753 --> 32:37.772
Auntie Lynn.

32:37.774 --> 32:38.676
Yes sweetie.

32:38.678 --> 32:39.789
Where do you keep your glasses?

32:39.791 --> 32:43.207
In the cabinet next to the sink.

32:46.248 --> 32:47.724
Hey.

32:47.726 --> 32:48.892
What's that?

32:53.971 --> 32:55.221
Just take it.

32:59.175 --> 33:00.071
Yeah, did you find everything?

33:00.073 --> 33:01.255
Yeah, I'm just getting some water.

33:01.257 --> 33:02.841
Okay good.

33:04.138 --> 33:05.721
Did you taste it?

33:06.624 --> 33:08.567
Did you get that from
my dad's liquor cabinet?

33:08.569 --> 33:09.535
It's nothing.

33:09.537 --> 33:10.491
No, you don't understand.

33:10.493 --> 33:11.682
It's fine.

33:11.684 --> 33:12.593
No.

33:12.595 --> 33:14.183
I'm not, I'm an expert at this.

33:14.185 --> 33:15.959
Mom always draws lines on the vodka bottles

33:15.961 --> 33:18.791
whenever she remembers and
I just pour a little out

33:18.793 --> 33:20.375
and fill it back up with some water.

33:20.377 --> 33:22.877
I do this all the time, drink.

33:24.480 --> 33:25.397
Is it good?

33:53.023 --> 33:54.273
Do you want it?

33:58.775 --> 34:02.858
Go ahead, just kidding.

34:05.918 --> 34:07.265
It's good right?

34:07.267 --> 34:08.101
Yeah.

34:09.193 --> 34:10.489
Hey Gabe, where's the bathroom?

34:10.492 --> 34:13.585
Just go down to the hall and make a right.

34:13.588 --> 34:15.581
Okay, thanks.

34:42.554 --> 34:43.938
Hey mom.

34:43.940 --> 34:45.110
Yeah!

34:45.112 --> 34:46.853
Gabe and I are gonna go for a walk.

34:46.856 --> 34:48.422
Alright, don't be too late.

34:48.425 --> 34:51.175
Go around the block Gabe.

34:54.199 --> 34:55.033
Okay.

34:57.439 --> 34:59.486
Look, look, look, see that?

34:59.488 --> 35:00.461
No.

35:02.296 --> 35:04.023
I see it.

35:04.025 --> 35:04.937
I don't see anything.

35:04.939 --> 35:06.439
Oh I see a star.

35:12.977 --> 35:13.807
Does your dad know?

35:13.809 --> 35:15.062
Look.

35:15.064 --> 35:15.898
I got it.

35:23.465 --> 35:27.465
Hey where were you the other night man?

35:28.610 --> 35:32.527
Terry made me study the Bible, again.

35:33.447 --> 35:34.278
Aw dude.

35:34.280 --> 35:35.267
It's all dry.

35:35.269 --> 35:36.254
Oh dude.

35:36.256 --> 35:37.320
How are we gonna wet the ball?

35:43.428 --> 35:44.262
Nice.

35:46.322 --> 35:48.278
Okay, you boys ready to
stand up for your county.

35:48.280 --> 35:50.856
So whoever we throw this
at gets a free beer right?

35:54.530 --> 35:55.475
It's heavy.

35:55.477 --> 35:56.579
Perfect, let's make some magic, babies.

35:56.581 --> 35:59.334
Hey Kien, you don't want any?

35:59.336 --> 36:00.934
You're not gonna drink?

36:00.936 --> 36:01.834
The Watchtower says we can't drink

36:01.836 --> 36:02.966
unless we're being supervised by adults.

36:02.968 --> 36:03.941
Here.

36:03.943 --> 36:06.638
You're not, you're not
gonna tell on us are you?

36:06.640 --> 36:07.474
Nah.

36:08.749 --> 36:10.925
We got you back.

36:10.927 --> 36:12.870
Hey, what's he gonna do?

36:12.872 --> 36:13.872
Oh got some.

36:20.119 --> 36:23.869
Here we go, soldier up.

36:25.352 --> 36:28.249
I didn't know he could climb that high.

36:31.144 --> 36:32.550
Seriously?

36:32.552 --> 36:33.557
Give me the ball.

36:33.559 --> 36:34.854
Ready?

36:45.517 --> 36:46.517
Oh!

37:08.872 --> 37:12.455
Did you lose your ball, little boy?

37:15.541 --> 37:17.124
Lose your football?

37:18.459 --> 37:21.376
Hey, I see you in the tree, fucker!

37:23.269 --> 37:27.436
That is a classic car and
you fucked up my car you fuck!

37:33.021 --> 37:36.600
Come on, you want to fuck around?

37:36.602 --> 37:39.533
You fucked with my fucking car, fucker!

37:39.535 --> 37:40.619
Come on down!

37:42.325 --> 37:43.945
Come on fucker!

37:43.947 --> 37:46.595
Hey, hey, it was me, it was me.

37:46.597 --> 37:48.515
- I threw the ball not him.
- It hit my car.

37:48.517 --> 37:50.017
I threw it, I'm sorry.

37:50.019 --> 37:51.363
We were just being stupid.

37:51.365 --> 37:53.579
I'm sorry believe me, I never
would have thrown the ball

37:53.581 --> 37:54.731
if I knew it was gonna hit your car.

37:54.733 --> 37:56.526
I'm really sorry.

37:56.528 --> 37:57.832
You're sorry.

37:57.834 --> 37:59.704
You're not gonna do that again?

37:59.706 --> 38:00.981
Never I swear to God.

38:00.983 --> 38:02.129
Hey, hey what are you doing?

38:02.131 --> 38:03.539
You fucking punk.

38:03.541 --> 38:04.796
What are you doing man?

38:04.798 --> 38:06.059
Hey, hey, hey relax.

38:06.061 --> 38:07.423
Oh it was four of you.

38:07.425 --> 38:08.434
Hey, hey.

38:08.436 --> 38:11.436
You can take me on, faggots.

38:14.860 --> 38:16.426
I'm taking this, taking your little toy.

38:16.428 --> 38:19.428
You better be glad I got shit to do.

38:24.351 --> 38:25.184
Fucker!

38:26.854 --> 38:28.438
You're all faggots!

38:33.802 --> 38:35.419
Come on Kien.

38:35.421 --> 38:36.671
Yeah.

38:39.483 --> 38:41.499
Got you Kien, yeah!

38:45.715 --> 38:47.100
You guys should have come
to that dance last week.

38:47.102 --> 38:49.727
Totally, totally hooked up with Tonya.

38:49.729 --> 38:50.988
Oh she's hot.

38:50.990 --> 38:52.604
And she has a nice car too.

38:52.606 --> 38:54.229
Yeah, her dad's some rich dude.

38:54.231 --> 38:55.916
How'd you hook up with her.

38:55.918 --> 38:57.410
We were drinking in the back of her car.

38:57.412 --> 39:00.530
Tony says she's a key maker.

39:00.532 --> 39:01.736
What's that?

39:03.106 --> 39:05.642
She used her teeth way too much down there.

39:05.644 --> 39:07.966
My fucking dick still hurts.

39:11.510 --> 39:12.571
That's hilarious.

39:12.573 --> 39:13.939
Can I have a beer?

39:13.941 --> 39:15.383
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

39:19.090 --> 39:20.997
Let's see how this is demonstrated

39:20.999 --> 39:24.131
with Brother Dagsland and Brother Nguyen

39:24.133 --> 39:26.503
from the Valley congregation.

39:26.505 --> 39:27.336
I'm not interested.

39:27.338 --> 39:28.533
Is it the Bible you're not

39:28.535 --> 39:30.662
interested in or is it religion in general?

39:30.664 --> 39:32.155
I'm gonna stop you there.

39:32.157 --> 39:34.963
You see what brother Dagsland just did.

39:34.965 --> 39:37.548
He took an objection and turned

39:38.657 --> 39:41.240
it into a conversation starter.

39:42.722 --> 39:44.135
Let's look back in on them.

39:44.137 --> 39:47.804
It's religion, I'm not a religious person.

39:49.258 --> 39:51.794
Let me assure you we're not
here to change your religion

39:51.796 --> 39:54.388
today but to give you
encouragement from the Bible.

39:54.390 --> 39:56.352
Brother Dagsland, have you been using

39:56.354 --> 39:58.224
questions when people have been

39:58.226 --> 40:01.051
giving you conversation
stoppers out in the field.

40:01.053 --> 40:02.037
Yes.

40:02.039 --> 40:05.956
And have you been able
to get Bible readings?

40:06.901 --> 40:07.735
No.

40:12.189 --> 40:15.689
Well Jehovah blessed your efforts,

40:15.691 --> 40:18.497
while you are in service with him.

40:18.499 --> 40:20.008
Thank you for your example.

40:27.157 --> 40:30.285
You did great, you did great son.

40:30.287 --> 40:32.215
I was so nervous.

40:32.217 --> 40:34.028
You looked like a natural.

40:34.030 --> 40:36.530
Jehovah answered your prayers.

40:40.640 --> 40:41.950
We'll meet you here after the services.

40:41.952 --> 40:42.785
Okay.

40:44.423 --> 40:45.818
Bye mom.

40:45.820 --> 40:47.512
The ring is amazing.

40:47.514 --> 40:48.785
Thank you.

40:48.787 --> 40:49.888
Do you have a date set yet?

40:49.890 --> 40:51.794
As soon as possible, right sweetheart.

40:51.796 --> 40:53.450
Hey Jim.

40:53.452 --> 40:54.419
Bobby, hey.

40:54.421 --> 40:56.512
Honey you've got to meet
this guy, he's a riot.

40:56.514 --> 40:58.979
That's masturbation Bill.

40:58.981 --> 41:01.283
No way, you got that guy yesterday.

41:01.285 --> 41:03.280
I can't even look at
him without thinking...

41:03.282 --> 41:04.955
Hello friends.

41:04.957 --> 41:08.874
This is Bill Anders, he
was baptized yesterday.

41:08.876 --> 41:10.043
Hello Sisters.

41:10.894 --> 41:12.385
Hi.

41:12.387 --> 41:13.898
Gabe, you should visit my congregation,

41:13.900 --> 41:15.193
we can preach together soon.

41:15.195 --> 41:16.274
Sure.

41:16.276 --> 41:17.249
Let me get your phone number.

41:17.251 --> 41:19.644
Jasmine, you should come with us too.

41:19.646 --> 41:21.731
Why don't you give me your number as well.

41:40.064 --> 41:42.885
Sisters, please welcome
Brother Isaac Jenkins.

41:51.742 --> 41:53.249
When evening came,

41:53.251 --> 41:54.669
Joseph arose from his bed and walked around

41:54.671 --> 41:55.984
the roof of the king's house.

41:55.986 --> 41:59.403
And from the roof he saw a woman bathing.

42:00.305 --> 42:02.483
And the woman was very
beautiful in appearance.

42:02.485 --> 42:06.678
And one said, is this not
Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam.

42:06.680 --> 42:09.524
David sent messenger to take her in.

42:09.526 --> 42:12.635
And when she came to him, he lay with her.

42:12.637 --> 42:14.867
She's looking at you.

42:14.869 --> 42:15.702
Who?

42:16.635 --> 42:18.218
Are you sleeping?

42:19.318 --> 42:20.700
Gabe.

42:20.702 --> 42:21.798
Hmm?

42:21.800 --> 42:22.803
Dude what are sleeping?

42:22.805 --> 42:23.905
No.

42:23.907 --> 42:25.274
That girl two rows down,

42:25.276 --> 42:26.747
she's looked at you at least twice.

42:26.749 --> 42:27.774
No, you're kidding.

42:27.776 --> 42:30.707
I'm not kidding, she's beautiful.

42:30.709 --> 42:33.171
Yeah she is.

42:33.173 --> 42:34.812
Well giddy up.

42:34.814 --> 42:39.720
The boy has lost spiritual and family...

42:39.722 --> 42:41.437
Here's my address.

42:41.439 --> 42:42.343
Thanks.

42:42.345 --> 42:43.513
You better not forget to mail me.

42:43.515 --> 42:45.026
I won't.

42:45.028 --> 42:46.695
Hi, my name is Gabe.

42:49.262 --> 42:50.771
He's disfellowshipped.

42:50.773 --> 42:51.885
Oh.

42:51.887 --> 42:54.314
You'll still mail me though right?

42:54.316 --> 42:55.340
Of course.

42:55.342 --> 42:57.191
Kaitlyn Freedman.

42:57.193 --> 42:58.700
You know her?

42:58.702 --> 43:00.524
Her dad's disfellowshipped.

43:00.526 --> 43:02.323
He's in the same congregation
as my cousin Isabel.

43:02.325 --> 43:04.019
Yeah I know, she told me.

43:04.021 --> 43:06.035
And do you know why he's disfellowshipped?

43:06.037 --> 43:07.196
No.

43:07.198 --> 43:10.948
He voted in the last presidential election.

43:12.767 --> 43:14.546
They're not as wild as I was.

43:14.548 --> 43:18.126
I was really, when I was in the 10th grade.

43:18.128 --> 43:20.628
I used to supply all the booze

43:23.686 --> 43:26.340
to the rest of the students at school.

43:27.994 --> 43:29.338
That's why we live in a community.

43:29.340 --> 43:33.423
Because when we stray we
share it, we confess it.

43:37.372 --> 43:40.318
Jehovah is gonna kill me at Armageddon.

43:40.320 --> 43:42.070
No he's not.

43:48.742 --> 43:52.718
Upsy daisy, upsy daisy.

43:52.720 --> 43:53.553
Hey!

43:57.461 --> 43:59.042
Water.

44:09.546 --> 44:11.046
Ooh man, your dad,

44:15.111 --> 44:16.695
your dad was tough.

44:21.572 --> 44:24.488
He was a violent man, it was scary.

44:25.800 --> 44:29.550
He's worked hard to
become a perfect Jehovah.

44:32.535 --> 44:35.369
I'm never gonna be a good Jehovah.

44:37.666 --> 44:38.833
But that, you.

44:44.827 --> 44:46.077
Stay a Jehovah.

44:49.508 --> 44:51.091
Listen to your dad.

44:54.947 --> 44:55.780
You.

45:00.001 --> 45:00.834
Jeff.

45:23.655 --> 45:25.144
Dad phone.

45:25.146 --> 45:26.260
Who is it?

45:26.262 --> 45:28.678
It's elder business.

45:31.733 --> 45:32.667
This is Brother Dagsland.

45:32.669 --> 45:35.225
You can hang up Gabe.

45:35.227 --> 45:36.483
Okay.

45:36.485 --> 45:38.053
Brother Dagsland it's Brother Knox.

45:38.055 --> 45:38.887
How are you doing brother Knox?

45:38.889 --> 45:41.365
Well not so good, that's why I called.

45:41.367 --> 45:43.131
Okay, go ahead.

45:43.133 --> 45:45.633
Oh this is hard to discuss.

45:48.726 --> 45:52.226
I'm not sure that we committed a sin, but.

45:55.954 --> 45:58.760
Brother Knox, Jehovah shows mercy

45:58.762 --> 46:01.004
to those who confess their sins.

46:01.006 --> 46:03.258
You're a good brother in the congregation.

46:03.260 --> 46:07.427
Feel fee to speak as Jehovah
and I are your friend.

46:10.360 --> 46:12.193
We committed sodomy.

46:15.202 --> 46:16.419
This may be hard Brother Knox,

46:16.421 --> 46:20.005
but you're need to give me all the details.

46:20.885 --> 46:25.052
We started to have sex, we
were in missionary position,

46:27.155 --> 46:29.961
we were kissing and in
the heat of the moment,

46:29.963 --> 46:34.046
I stuck my penis in and
started going in and out,

46:35.883 --> 46:37.966
until my wife stopped me.

46:39.160 --> 46:41.910
I didn't know it was in her butt.

46:48.160 --> 46:50.553
And how many times would you
go in and out would you say?

46:50.555 --> 46:51.805
Five I think.

46:54.041 --> 46:56.457
And did your wife enjoy it?

46:59.604 --> 47:01.475
Hold on a sec?

47:01.477 --> 47:05.060
He wants to know if you, if you enjoyed it?

47:06.082 --> 47:07.968
Come talk to him.

47:07.970 --> 47:11.887
Just say something,
just say something honey.

47:17.762 --> 47:19.867
Hello Brother Dagsland.

47:19.869 --> 47:22.767
Sister Knox go ahead and give
me your version of the sin.

47:22.769 --> 47:25.867
Well we were in the heat of the moment

47:25.869 --> 47:29.751
and I didn't even realize
that he was in the wrong area.

47:29.753 --> 47:32.149
I was concentrating on his eyes.

47:32.151 --> 47:33.604
He does have nice eyes.

47:33.606 --> 47:35.023
Did you enjoy it?

47:39.528 --> 47:41.528
I enjoyed the kissing.

47:42.938 --> 47:44.050
All right Sister Knox you can put

47:44.052 --> 47:45.546
Brother Knox back on the phone.

47:45.548 --> 47:46.381
Yes.

47:48.467 --> 47:49.972
Brother Knox, I need to be sure,

47:49.974 --> 47:52.483
did you ejaculate in your wife's anus?

47:52.485 --> 47:54.494
No, like she said we stopped the sex.

47:54.496 --> 47:56.711
Practicing sodomy is against Jehovah,

47:56.713 --> 47:59.249
it's a sin, because it's a homosexual act

47:59.251 --> 48:01.483
and we don't want to have
anything to do with homosexuality.

48:01.485 --> 48:03.149
Well we sure don't.

48:03.151 --> 48:05.798
I doubt we'll have to convene a committee

48:05.800 --> 48:08.664
meeting about this but we will
schedule a shepherding call.

48:08.666 --> 48:10.896
Another Elder and myself will come over and

48:13.510 --> 48:14.640
Thank you.

48:14.642 --> 48:16.242
Thank you.

48:18.851 --> 48:19.894
If I can get everyone's attention

48:19.896 --> 48:21.258
for just one quick second.

48:21.260 --> 48:24.104
Jehovah would be honored and proud

48:24.106 --> 48:27.042
of the both of you getting married.

48:27.044 --> 48:29.162
It's an honor to be your best man.

48:29.164 --> 48:31.271
To Allie and Jim.

48:32.907 --> 48:35.574
Thank you, thank you everyone.

48:36.635 --> 48:40.075
And thank you Jasmine, my best friend

48:40.077 --> 48:41.512
and now my bridesmaid.

48:41.514 --> 48:43.041
Hopefully you and John
will get married soon.

48:43.043 --> 48:44.899
That's why we put you guys together

48:44.901 --> 48:46.392
as bridesmaid and best man.

48:46.394 --> 48:48.388
Just give it little bit of time.

48:48.390 --> 48:52.008
Hey, hey Jasmine, cover your ears.

48:52.010 --> 48:53.466
Hey how did he get her?

48:53.468 --> 48:56.577
He's old and he has a job.

48:56.579 --> 48:59.082
Forget about Jasmine.

48:59.084 --> 49:00.700
Hey, at least we can drink now

49:00.702 --> 49:02.336
since we're being supervised by adults.

49:02.338 --> 49:03.744
Why do you memorize that stuff?

49:05.834 --> 49:07.363
Hi, I'm Krissy.

49:07.365 --> 49:09.071
Hi Krissy, I'm Gabe.

49:09.073 --> 49:10.675
Hi pleased to meet you.

49:10.677 --> 49:14.843
Nice to meet you too.

49:55.081 --> 49:57.414
Why are you looking at me?

49:59.604 --> 50:00.438
Stop it!

50:03.889 --> 50:05.472
Stop looking at me!

50:08.084 --> 50:09.001
I hate you!

50:11.378 --> 50:13.300
I wasn't looking at you.

50:13.302 --> 50:14.738
I hate you!

50:19.767 --> 50:21.267
Oh no.

50:31.537 --> 50:32.995
Come man, come, forget about it.

50:32.997 --> 50:36.580
Come on, let's go to Uncle Jeff's.

50:44.555 --> 50:46.032
Your uncle doesn't have any food.

50:46.034 --> 50:47.309
Hello!

50:47.311 --> 50:48.767
That's because he's a musician.

50:48.769 --> 50:50.568
Hello!

50:50.570 --> 50:51.903
Is anybody home?

51:03.811 --> 51:04.856
You're a really great guy.

51:04.858 --> 51:05.843
Thanks.

51:05.845 --> 51:07.448
You're a really nice guy.

51:10.912 --> 51:15.079
Hey I got to get Kien
home, you know his stomach.

51:20.191 --> 51:21.432
Dress.

51:21.434 --> 51:22.329
What?

51:22.331 --> 51:23.164
Off.

52:02.631 --> 52:03.548
Hey Jeff.

52:06.140 --> 52:08.890
Is Jeff your roommate?

52:11.090 --> 52:13.590
Oh hey, how are you feeling?

52:15.050 --> 52:18.550
Thanks for taking care of me last night.

52:20.992 --> 52:23.510
I found aspirin so headaches gone.

52:23.512 --> 52:26.894
Do you remember throwing up?

52:26.896 --> 52:27.979
Some of it.

52:35.642 --> 52:38.059
Did you take advantage of me?

52:39.582 --> 52:43.666
No, no, no, you told me
to take your dress off.

52:46.063 --> 52:47.313
Just kidding.

53:09.390 --> 53:12.807
So what congregation are you in?

53:45.999 --> 53:46.832
I'm sorry.

53:50.570 --> 53:53.537
You're no fun.

53:53.539 --> 53:57.283
Okay guys give me five
concise sentences, hey,

53:57.285 --> 53:59.352
on what we just discussed.

53:59.354 --> 54:01.437
Show me that you know it.

54:08.262 --> 54:10.818
I, uh...

54:12.352 --> 54:14.341
I read that magazine, the Bible one.

54:14.343 --> 54:15.370
Oh did you?

54:15.372 --> 54:16.742
Yeah.

54:16.744 --> 54:19.497
It's kind of, it's kind of cool.

54:19.499 --> 54:20.332
Yeah.

54:22.177 --> 54:24.158
My family's episcopalian so we

54:24.160 --> 54:25.736
just kind of love everyone.

54:25.738 --> 54:27.526
No talking please, this isn't

54:27.528 --> 54:30.361
an oral exam guys, come on people.

54:37.764 --> 54:38.597
Zip it up.

54:50.459 --> 54:52.376
We need to ask you a couple of questions.

54:52.378 --> 54:56.128
Okay, I admit it, I felt my cousins breast.

54:56.977 --> 54:59.006
Boobs are awesome.

54:59.008 --> 55:00.372
It has been brought to our attention

55:00.374 --> 55:02.678
that you stayed the night with a girl.

55:02.680 --> 55:03.513
What?

55:04.590 --> 55:06.441
Krissy from...

55:06.443 --> 55:07.934
Vacaville Congregation.

55:07.936 --> 55:09.733
You spent the night with her.

55:09.735 --> 55:10.568
No, I

55:14.474 --> 55:17.492
she slept on the bed
and I slept on the couch.

55:17.494 --> 55:19.256
We only kissed.

55:19.258 --> 55:21.093
You sound like you're proud of that.

55:21.095 --> 55:22.479
No.

55:22.481 --> 55:23.430
According to the witness who

55:23.432 --> 55:24.512
brought this to out attention,

55:24.514 --> 55:25.720
your Uncle Jeff wasn't home and you

55:25.722 --> 55:27.104
spent the night alone with Krissy.

55:27.106 --> 55:28.037
Yeah, no.

55:28.039 --> 55:30.508
I slept on the couch and
she slept on Jeff's bed.

55:30.510 --> 55:31.986
She was sick.

55:31.988 --> 55:35.586
She was probably ate something
at the engagement party.

55:35.588 --> 55:37.492
I let her use the bathroom and puke

55:37.494 --> 55:38.736
and then she went to bed.

55:38.738 --> 55:41.111
It's a sin when a man and
a woman spend the night

55:41.113 --> 55:43.613
alone together alone in house
if they're aren't married.

55:43.615 --> 55:44.765
I slept on the couch.

55:44.767 --> 55:47.251
She slept on the bed, she was sick.

55:47.253 --> 55:48.633
It doesn't matter how
you twist these words.

55:48.635 --> 55:51.028
It is explained very clearly in the 1983

55:51.030 --> 55:53.044
Truth Magazine that
spending the night together

55:53.046 --> 55:54.648
is misconduct and from we understand,

55:54.650 --> 55:57.126
you and Krissy spent the night together.

55:57.128 --> 55:58.425
She slept on Jeff's bed.

55:58.427 --> 55:59.611
If your mom stayed the night in my house

55:59.613 --> 56:02.352
alone, your dad could divorce her

56:02.354 --> 56:04.564
because it would seem obvious
that he cheated on him.

56:04.566 --> 56:07.733
You understand that this
is a sin against Jehovah.

56:07.735 --> 56:10.684
Krissy said that you took off her dress.

56:10.686 --> 56:13.367
She admitted that she was drinking.

56:13.369 --> 56:15.580
But you said that she had food poisoning.

56:15.582 --> 56:17.582
Why would you lie to us?

56:19.869 --> 56:23.539
I didn't want to get her in trouble.

56:23.541 --> 56:24.528
Did you know that she's engaged?

56:24.530 --> 56:25.640
Why did you take her dress off?

56:25.642 --> 56:26.903
She asked me too.

56:26.905 --> 56:28.405
It had puke on it.

56:32.068 --> 56:33.187
According to her, she doesn't remember

56:33.189 --> 56:35.472
asking you or what happened
after her dress was off.

56:35.474 --> 56:36.872
Did you take your clothes off

56:36.874 --> 56:38.207
before you got into bed with her.

56:38.209 --> 56:39.249
I didn't get into bed with her.

56:39.251 --> 56:40.490
I told you that.

56:40.492 --> 56:44.472
Did you insert your tongue into her mouth.

56:44.474 --> 56:45.307
Yes.

56:46.954 --> 56:47.995
Did you touch her breast?

56:47.997 --> 56:48.979
No.

56:48.981 --> 56:49.905
After you took her dress
off when she was drink,

56:49.907 --> 56:51.776
did you look under her clothes
to see her vagina or breasts?

56:51.778 --> 56:54.137
No, I didn't see her vagina or breasts?

56:54.139 --> 56:56.655
Did any arousal occur
when you kissed Krissy?

56:56.657 --> 56:57.680
No.

56:57.682 --> 56:59.265
Do you understand that this
is a sin against Jehovah?

56:59.267 --> 57:00.776
Spending the night
together is loose conduct.

57:00.778 --> 57:01.997
I didn't get into bed with her.

57:01.999 --> 57:03.551
This is your opportunity
to be honest with us.

57:03.553 --> 57:05.151
Did any arousal occur when you

57:05.153 --> 57:07.602
kissed Krissy with your tongue?

57:07.604 --> 57:08.624
No, I said no.

57:08.626 --> 57:09.814
I don't get it.

57:09.816 --> 57:11.200
She was drunk and puking.

57:11.202 --> 57:14.640
I picked up her puke, I pulled
her hair out of the toilet,

57:14.642 --> 57:16.079
I did the right thing.

57:16.081 --> 57:17.899
It's what Jesus would have done.

57:17.901 --> 57:20.234
- Oh my god.
- How dare you?

57:26.733 --> 57:30.854
I'm afraid I don't see any alternative.

57:30.856 --> 57:33.405
Acting under Jehovah's direction,

57:33.407 --> 57:36.501
we've decided to disfellowship you.

57:36.503 --> 57:39.812
You can write us a letter after
six months to be reinstated.

57:39.814 --> 57:42.673
You can't speak to any Jehovah's
witness during that time.

57:42.675 --> 57:46.619
Since you're still underage,
you can live with your parents.

57:46.621 --> 57:47.954
What happened?

57:49.443 --> 57:50.626
He's being disfellowshipped.

57:50.628 --> 57:51.908
What did you do?

57:51.910 --> 57:53.655
Give me the keys to the shop.

57:53.657 --> 57:55.365
I don't have the keys.

57:57.925 --> 57:59.611
I'm glad he's on tour so he

57:59.613 --> 58:02.363
won't be stumbled by your actions.

58:04.869 --> 58:06.019
Lynn get in the fucking car!

58:15.356 --> 58:17.841
Get in the fucking car, shut him up!

58:23.666 --> 58:25.468
Magic feet, hit me.

58:25.470 --> 58:27.490
Oh, man down.

58:27.492 --> 58:29.075
Hey Gabe.

58:30.122 --> 58:31.789
Hey, I have to go.

58:32.820 --> 58:33.738
Peter what's his problem?

58:33.740 --> 58:35.481
He's cool, he's just
going through some stuff.

58:35.483 --> 58:36.562
Yeah but he

58:36.564 --> 58:37.588
doesn't have to ignore us like that.

58:42.563 --> 58:43.396
Gabe,

58:46.803 --> 58:47.637
Gabe.

58:51.617 --> 58:52.780
Hey Gabe.

58:52.782 --> 58:54.782
Leave me alone!

58:57.338 --> 58:58.887
All right guys, get back to work.

59:23.492 --> 59:24.409
Hey Gabe.

59:25.416 --> 59:26.600
Hey.

59:26.602 --> 59:28.349
That's my book.

59:28.351 --> 59:29.952
Oh, I'm sorry.

59:29.954 --> 59:31.713
No, you should read it.

59:31.715 --> 59:33.028
Really?

59:33.030 --> 59:34.997
Yeah, I think you'll like it.

59:34.999 --> 59:35.832
Thanks.

01:00:06.939 --> 01:00:09.506
The damned one moves through the crowd.

01:00:09.508 --> 01:00:13.341
The elders have brought
down their judgements.

01:00:17.787 --> 01:00:18.619
Hi.

01:00:23.313 --> 01:00:24.213
Sometimes it's harder

01:00:24.215 --> 01:00:26.175
to shun than be shunned.

01:00:34.079 --> 01:00:37.548
One minute looking at
you is days of sunshine.

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:39.467
Defy gravity, swim out.

01:00:41.115 --> 01:00:45.166
The tide comes in, fish smile with no hook.

01:01:24.727 --> 01:01:25.733
Hi.

01:01:25.735 --> 01:01:26.669
Hey.

01:01:37.619 --> 01:01:40.454
I like Kerook, does he have other books?

01:01:40.456 --> 01:01:41.698
Kerook?

01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:42.758
Yeah.

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:44.510
Oh Kerouac, oh yes.

01:01:45.550 --> 01:01:46.468
Kerouac.

01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:47.818
Yes he's written lots of books

01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:49.689
but unfortunately we don't
carry any of them here.

01:01:49.691 --> 01:01:51.984
It's at the public library though.

01:01:51.986 --> 01:01:52.992
Do you have a library card?

01:01:52.994 --> 01:01:53.827
No.

01:01:54.794 --> 01:01:58.575
No, well if you like him, you might

01:01:58.577 --> 01:02:00.841
like one of my other favorites.

01:02:00.843 --> 01:02:03.343
He's part of the Beat Generation.

01:02:06.481 --> 01:02:07.312
Try him.

01:02:07.314 --> 01:02:08.146
Henry Miller.

01:02:08.148 --> 01:02:08.979
Mm-hmm.

01:02:08.981 --> 01:02:10.809
Thanks Mrs. Eagen.

01:02:10.811 --> 01:02:11.943
Get that card.

01:02:11.945 --> 01:02:13.584
Okay I will.

01:02:13.586 --> 01:02:14.669
Psst, psst,

01:02:21.550 --> 01:02:23.633
were you crying in class?

01:02:27.093 --> 01:02:29.899
Why are you sitting with
your friends at lunch?

01:02:29.901 --> 01:02:33.321
I got disfellowshipped so
they can't really talk to me.

01:02:33.323 --> 01:02:34.834
Did you do something wrong?

01:02:34.836 --> 01:02:36.182
I thought you liked
being a Jehovah's Witness.

01:02:36.184 --> 01:02:39.767
No talking in detention please.

01:02:43.874 --> 01:02:45.312
Now as he was saying these things,

01:02:45.314 --> 01:02:46.930
a woman called out to him.

01:02:46.932 --> 01:02:49.037
Happy is the womb that carried him

01:02:49.039 --> 01:02:51.606
and the breast that nursed him.

01:02:51.608 --> 01:02:54.198
Gabe, it'll all be over soon.

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:56.347
He redirected her praise to happy

01:02:56.349 --> 01:03:01.100
are those hearing the
word of God and keeping it.

01:03:01.102 --> 01:03:04.852
What we do for Jehovah,
we don't do for glory

01:03:05.867 --> 01:03:09.720
or to show our brothers
and sisters our faith.

01:03:09.722 --> 01:03:12.792
Jehovah gave us the gift of life.

01:03:12.794 --> 01:03:17.097
What we give him is nothing in comparison.

01:03:17.099 --> 01:03:19.830
It's all in there.

01:03:19.832 --> 01:03:21.166
Crisis of faith.

01:03:23.072 --> 01:03:25.739
Malawi was just, it was awful.

01:03:27.813 --> 01:03:31.097
Jehovah Witnesses do
not even salute the flag.

01:03:31.099 --> 01:03:33.403
As far as we're concerned that's showing

01:03:33.405 --> 01:03:35.294
allegiance to a country.

01:03:35.296 --> 01:03:36.548
There were supposed to
torture say, a political call

01:03:36.550 --> 01:03:39.133
Malawi was a one party country,

01:03:41.090 --> 01:03:43.892
but we dot get involved in politics.

01:03:43.894 --> 01:03:47.477
Witnesses have been murdered, imprisoned,

01:03:49.115 --> 01:03:51.595
just because they are Jehovah's Witnesses.

01:03:51.597 --> 01:03:54.818
It is because of our standard, thousands

01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:58.957
of witnesses were
brutally raped and killed.

01:03:58.959 --> 01:04:02.376
I don't get this, this is really weird.

01:04:04.235 --> 01:04:06.106
They had us right
letters to the politicians

01:04:06.108 --> 01:04:10.548
in Malawi to stop the slaughter
of our brothers and sisters

01:04:10.550 --> 01:04:12.421
when they could have stopped it all along.

01:04:12.423 --> 01:04:15.318
I need to read this book.

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:16.671
No, I'm keeping it for a while.

01:04:16.673 --> 01:04:18.090
This is bullshit.

01:04:23.590 --> 01:04:24.903
Aren't you guys scared you'll get

01:04:24.905 --> 01:04:26.341
in trouble for talking to me?

01:04:26.343 --> 01:04:28.093
Yeah, we better go.

01:04:32.555 --> 01:04:33.483
Hello.

01:04:33.485 --> 01:04:34.387
Hey dork.

01:04:34.389 --> 01:04:36.028
Karen, where are you?

01:04:36.030 --> 01:04:37.899
I heard you got disfellowed or something.

01:04:37.901 --> 01:04:39.666
Yeah, right away you went away.

01:04:39.668 --> 01:04:41.573
This town's a shit hole.

01:04:41.575 --> 01:04:43.408
I'm in San Francisco come meet me.

01:04:43.410 --> 01:04:45.660
I can't use dad's car so.

01:04:47.334 --> 01:04:50.787
Take a train or a bus,
I don't know grow up.

01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:51.622
Okay.

01:04:52.657 --> 01:04:53.936
Don't tell anyone I'm here.

01:04:53.938 --> 01:04:54.771
Okay.

01:04:56.852 --> 01:04:58.238
I wouldn't tell anybody, no.

01:04:58.240 --> 01:04:59.874
See you on Monday.

01:04:59.876 --> 01:05:00.876
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:05:02.142 --> 01:05:03.042
How was Paris?

01:05:03.044 --> 01:05:04.934
Amazing, I'm moving there.

01:05:04.936 --> 01:05:07.523
Can I stay here tonight?

01:05:07.525 --> 01:05:08.841
Is it all right with Allen?

01:05:08.843 --> 01:05:11.307
Dad doesn't really care too much anymore.

01:05:11.309 --> 01:05:12.983
He's been acting weird.

01:05:12.985 --> 01:05:15.485
That works out well for you.

01:05:18.648 --> 01:05:20.557
Hey dad can I have a beer?

01:05:20.559 --> 01:05:22.195
Is your Uncle Jeff up there?

01:05:22.197 --> 01:05:23.470
He's right here.

01:05:23.472 --> 01:05:25.113
Okay, one.

01:05:25.115 --> 01:05:26.173
Thank you.

01:05:26.175 --> 01:05:29.680
I'm gonna go see some bands with Karen.

01:05:29.682 --> 01:05:31.102
They found Karen?

01:05:31.104 --> 01:05:34.771
Don't tell anyone, she's in San Francisco.

01:05:40.532 --> 01:05:42.091
Fun money.

01:05:42.093 --> 01:05:43.070
Thanks.

01:05:43.072 --> 01:05:44.907
Make it last.

01:05:44.909 --> 01:05:46.213
She was right, I did need to grow up.

01:05:46.215 --> 01:05:49.113
To do something for myself.

01:05:49.115 --> 01:05:51.613
Go somewhere that kind of scares me.

01:05:51.615 --> 01:05:54.365
And what did I have left to lose?

01:05:55.468 --> 01:05:59.048
My world was in shambles,
I was sneaking poems

01:05:59.050 --> 01:06:01.821
into girls lockers and I'm not

01:06:01.823 --> 01:06:03.729
even allowed to talk to my friends.

01:06:03.731 --> 01:06:07.256
Really, I was going a little nuts.

01:06:07.258 --> 01:06:10.751
I mean I'm almost 17, why not head

01:06:10.753 --> 01:06:12.907
for the city of milk and honey.

01:06:12.909 --> 01:06:16.242
Or, as my dad calls it, Sodom Francisco.

01:06:22.434 --> 01:06:23.265
Hey.

01:06:23.267 --> 01:06:24.101
Hi.

01:06:25.528 --> 01:06:28.097
Hey, I wouldn't have recognized you.

01:06:28.099 --> 01:06:31.017
Yeah you look like a cool
Jehovah or skooter boy.

01:06:31.019 --> 01:06:32.570
Thanks.

01:06:32.572 --> 01:06:34.739
Come on let's go inside.

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:43.396
Karen, who hit you?

01:06:43.398 --> 01:06:44.398
Slam pits.

01:06:47.952 --> 01:06:51.910
Did you run away because
your dad was molesting you?

01:06:51.912 --> 01:06:55.207
Hey, you're the guy who
grabbed his cousin's tits.

01:06:55.209 --> 01:06:57.885
Come on I'm hungry, let's eat.

01:07:07.633 --> 01:07:08.479
Ooh it's good.

01:07:08.481 --> 01:07:09.312
Aw shit.

01:07:09.314 --> 01:07:10.146
What?

01:07:10.148 --> 01:07:13.209
It's Jasmine and that's her fiance

01:07:13.211 --> 01:07:15.028
and some other Jehovah...

01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:16.452
Which is Jasmine?

01:07:16.454 --> 01:07:17.285
The darker one with the long hair.

01:07:17.287 --> 01:07:18.119
The green sweater?

01:07:18.121 --> 01:07:19.148
Yeah, next to hot white guy.

01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:21.095
Come on let's go get coffee.

01:07:21.097 --> 01:07:24.097
Show them you're having a good time.

01:07:42.669 --> 01:07:43.503
Fuck this.

01:07:45.102 --> 01:07:46.698
Hey guys.

01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:47.923
I'm a Jehovah's Witness too.

01:07:47.925 --> 01:07:50.356
I'm going to the Fab
Mab tonight to meet some

01:07:50.358 --> 01:07:52.082
of my Jehovah Witness friends.

01:07:52.084 --> 01:07:54.168
You guys should all come.

01:08:01.965 --> 01:08:02.796
Fuck them, let's go.

01:08:22.087 --> 01:08:23.096
My father couldn't read or write,

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:24.948
he'd gone to work in the coal mines

01:08:24.951 --> 01:08:26.194
when he was six years old.

01:08:26.196 --> 01:08:27.575
My mother was very smart but she

01:08:27.577 --> 01:08:29.609
was very heavy on the north end.

01:08:29.612 --> 01:08:32.779
When she was married to him it was not

01:08:35.156 --> 01:08:36.805
a loving relationship but she was very kind

01:08:36.808 --> 01:08:39.225
and she made it work for her.

01:08:41.401 --> 01:08:45.127
But they loved us, they
loved my sister and me.

01:08:51.808 --> 01:08:53.850
I wanted to read the Bible so my friend

01:08:53.853 --> 01:08:58.283
told me to get in touch
with Jehovah Witnesses

01:08:58.286 --> 01:09:00.354
and they'll come teach you the Bible,

01:09:00.357 --> 01:09:02.658
and give you a Bible.

01:09:02.661 --> 01:09:03.935
And did they?

01:09:03.937 --> 01:09:04.904
Yeah.

01:09:04.907 --> 01:09:06.782
And did you read that Bible?

01:09:06.783 --> 01:09:07.966
Yes I did.

01:09:07.969 --> 01:09:10.867
Faith is not an easy thing.

01:09:10.868 --> 01:09:13.618
We make that choice and why would

01:09:14.487 --> 01:09:17.524
you choose to walk with the devil?

01:09:20.598 --> 01:09:21.555
This is the 17th hill.

01:09:21.558 --> 01:09:23.058
Here, over here.

01:09:32.161 --> 01:09:33.256
Even better than ketchup is hot sauce.

01:09:33.258 --> 01:09:34.497
- Hi.
- You eat hot sauce?

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:35.649
Yeah.

01:09:35.652 --> 01:09:36.734
I'm Angela.

01:09:41.108 --> 01:09:43.042
Oh hi, good morning.

01:09:43.044 --> 01:09:45.376
Breakfast is on the table.

01:09:48.635 --> 01:09:49.529
A little hungover?

01:09:49.532 --> 01:09:52.377
Nah, I'm just thirsty.

01:09:52.379 --> 01:09:55.712
Karen says you're a Jehovah's witness?

01:09:56.679 --> 01:09:58.097
It's cool, cuz.

01:10:00.482 --> 01:10:01.666
You get to have like 12 wives?

01:10:03.575 --> 01:10:04.833
Use electricity?

01:10:04.835 --> 01:10:06.418
Yes we do.

01:10:13.116 --> 01:10:16.026
It's a big world out here Gabey.

01:10:16.028 --> 01:10:16.861
I know.

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:20.533
Good afternoon boys and girls,

01:10:20.535 --> 01:10:23.702
the baking club which usually
meets Friday at 4:00 p.m.

01:10:23.704 --> 01:10:26.869
Is now meeting on Monday at 3:30.

01:10:26.871 --> 01:10:27.912
Are you ready for today?

01:10:27.914 --> 01:10:28.867
Are you ready for today?

01:10:28.869 --> 01:10:29.927
I'm always ready for school.

01:10:29.929 --> 01:10:30.762
Hey.

01:10:35.425 --> 01:10:36.257
What are you doing?

01:10:36.259 --> 01:10:37.090
Why'd you shave your head?

01:10:37.092 --> 01:10:39.184
Dad said my hair was getting too long.

01:10:39.186 --> 01:10:40.895
Wait, wait your dad knows.

01:10:40.897 --> 01:10:42.314
He knows about that?

01:10:42.316 --> 01:10:43.685
Yeah he knows.

01:10:43.687 --> 01:10:44.860
I mean is that okay?

01:10:44.862 --> 01:10:46.258
No, it's great.

01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:50.187
What are the elders gonna say?

01:10:50.189 --> 01:10:51.235
I couldn't care less.

01:10:51.237 --> 01:10:52.837
Well it's been six months.

01:10:52.839 --> 01:10:54.690
I couldn't care less.

01:10:54.692 --> 01:10:56.182
And we have received

01:10:56.184 --> 01:10:57.534
your letter for reinstatement.

01:10:57.536 --> 01:10:59.262
We need to ask you a few questions.

01:10:59.264 --> 01:11:00.097
Okay.

01:11:01.027 --> 01:11:03.777
Do you have worldly girlfriend?

01:11:07.062 --> 01:11:07.895
No.

01:11:10.086 --> 01:11:11.557
Gabe, lying to us is not

01:11:11.559 --> 01:11:12.907
- going to get you reinstated.
- I'm not lying.

01:11:12.909 --> 01:11:15.662
You were observed in the city with a woman,

01:11:15.664 --> 01:11:17.284
she had her arm around you.

01:11:17.286 --> 01:11:20.020
She had a ring in her nose and some

01:11:20.022 --> 01:11:22.123
sort of punk rock colored hair.

01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:24.013
We don't find this funny?

01:11:24.015 --> 01:11:24.917
No.

01:11:24.919 --> 01:11:25.850
It's my cousin.

01:11:25.852 --> 01:11:27.610
Your cousin puts her arm around
you and you hold her hand?

01:11:27.612 --> 01:11:31.779
Yeah we'll we're close,
we're just being friendly.

01:11:33.468 --> 01:11:35.337
Your cousin.

01:11:35.339 --> 01:11:36.448
Yeah.

01:11:36.450 --> 01:11:37.458
That's it.

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:39.672
Have you been communicating with any

01:11:39.674 --> 01:11:41.673
Jehovah's Witnesses at school?

01:11:41.675 --> 01:11:44.925
Maybe leaving letters in their lockers?

01:11:47.147 --> 01:11:48.043
No.

01:11:48.045 --> 01:11:48.979
Poems.

01:11:48.981 --> 01:11:50.117
No, poem, nothing.

01:11:50.119 --> 01:11:51.485
Have you spent the night alone with anyone

01:11:51.487 --> 01:11:53.573
of the opposite sex or committed any sins

01:11:53.575 --> 01:11:55.492
since our last meeting?

01:12:00.897 --> 01:12:01.761
Have you?

01:12:01.763 --> 01:12:02.595
No.

01:12:09.409 --> 01:12:11.319
All right then, we can now

01:12:11.321 --> 01:12:13.623
welcome you back to the congregation.

01:12:13.625 --> 01:12:14.625
Thank you.

01:12:15.714 --> 01:12:16.681
Welcome brother.

01:12:16.683 --> 01:12:18.409
You did well Gabe.

01:12:37.942 --> 01:12:40.110
- Good job son.
- Thanks, Dad.

01:12:41.311 --> 01:12:43.811
We're ready for you brother.

01:12:52.006 --> 01:12:52.903
Hello.

01:12:52.905 --> 01:12:54.863
Hi.

01:12:54.865 --> 01:12:56.958
Jasmine?

01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:58.574
How have you been?

01:12:58.576 --> 01:13:02.190
I can talk to you now so I'm great.

01:13:02.192 --> 01:13:06.360
So who was that girl that you were dating?

01:13:08.428 --> 01:13:10.422
That's my cousin.

01:13:10.424 --> 01:13:13.321
You're dating your cousin?

01:13:13.323 --> 01:13:16.306
No, she was just messing with you.

01:13:16.308 --> 01:13:18.891
Well she's a bitch.

01:13:21.258 --> 01:13:22.340
How's John?

01:13:25.491 --> 01:13:26.818
He's fine.

01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:30.320
He keeps changing the date of the wedding,

01:13:31.697 --> 01:13:33.136
keeps pushing it forward.

01:13:33.138 --> 01:13:34.305
That's fine.

01:13:35.643 --> 01:13:36.650
Yeah well I shouldn't even

01:13:36.652 --> 01:13:37.586
be talking to him about you.

01:13:37.588 --> 01:13:41.239
Or I shouldn't be talking to you about him.

01:13:41.241 --> 01:13:43.618
You know since I've been disfellowshipped,

01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:45.106
it's pretty important for me to not

01:13:45.108 --> 01:13:47.842
talk about the little things
and just get to the point.

01:13:47.844 --> 01:13:50.262
I really miss talking to you.

01:13:57.099 --> 01:13:58.422
I've got to go.

01:13:58.424 --> 01:13:59.257
Bye.

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:05.112
Mom?

01:14:08.777 --> 01:14:09.610
Mom?

01:14:12.612 --> 01:14:14.194
Mom?

01:14:14.196 --> 01:14:15.184
What?

01:14:15.186 --> 01:14:16.518
What happened?

01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:20.187
There's holes in the doors.

01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:21.935
Your father got angry, it's funny.

01:14:21.937 --> 01:14:23.287
Are you okay?

01:14:23.289 --> 01:14:24.400
Of course.

01:14:24.402 --> 01:14:25.319
You hungry?

01:14:27.066 --> 01:14:28.316
How was school?

01:14:33.099 --> 01:14:34.071
They found the book,

01:14:34.073 --> 01:14:35.491
I'm in deep shit.

01:14:37.410 --> 01:14:40.177
How long are you grounded for?

01:14:40.179 --> 01:14:41.958
I've got to go see the elders and then

01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:46.128
my dad will decide if the
elders decide if I'm apostic.

01:14:47.668 --> 01:14:50.660
Whoa, whoa, they think you're apostic?

01:14:50.662 --> 01:14:52.311
Yeah.

01:14:52.313 --> 01:14:53.248
No.

01:14:53.250 --> 01:14:54.846
Yeah.

01:14:54.848 --> 01:14:56.992
You know the worst part of it?

01:14:56.994 --> 01:15:00.411
They called Kien, he lied about the book.

01:15:05.379 --> 01:15:06.422
I don't know what I'm supposed to think.

01:15:06.424 --> 01:15:07.256
Is he my friend?

01:15:07.258 --> 01:15:08.840
That's messed up.

01:15:11.126 --> 01:15:13.959
My dad punched a hole in our door.

01:15:17.196 --> 01:15:19.465
I'm glad me and you are friends.

01:15:21.334 --> 01:15:22.681
Who are you talking to in there?

01:15:22.683 --> 01:15:24.583
Just a minute.

01:15:24.585 --> 01:15:28.330
Who are you talking to, Peter, hey?

01:15:28.332 --> 01:15:29.521
Hey.

01:15:38.009 --> 01:15:39.256
Okay good night.

01:15:39.258 --> 01:15:41.008
Good night.

01:15:46.385 --> 01:15:47.885
Hey, come in here.

01:15:56.072 --> 01:15:57.379
No, in my bed.

01:15:57.381 --> 01:15:58.214
What?

01:15:59.974 --> 01:16:02.488
I told Beth you were my
cousin through marriage

01:16:02.490 --> 01:16:04.672
and we've been fucking for a while.

01:16:04.674 --> 01:16:06.037
Why?

01:16:06.039 --> 01:16:08.871
Because she keeps hitting on me.

01:16:13.495 --> 01:16:14.328
Get in.

01:16:18.644 --> 01:16:19.477
Get in.

01:16:49.277 --> 01:16:50.752
Oh sorry.

01:16:50.754 --> 01:16:53.185
Don't leave, it's okay.

01:16:53.187 --> 01:16:55.270
It's okay, I can feel it.

01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:56.953
Stay.

01:17:40.438 --> 01:17:41.877
Aww, aww.

01:17:41.879 --> 01:17:43.346
Sorry.

01:17:43.348 --> 01:17:45.453
It's okay.

01:18:37.402 --> 01:18:38.374
You're lying to the elders,

01:18:38.376 --> 01:18:39.882
now Peter's getting grounded.

01:18:39.884 --> 01:18:41.628
I've never been in trouble before.

01:18:41.630 --> 01:18:44.279
You know I figure why should
both of us get in trouble?

01:18:44.281 --> 01:18:47.781
You better think of your friends.

01:18:49.477 --> 01:18:50.307
Jasmine wants me to be

01:18:50.309 --> 01:18:51.958
her partner in preaching tomorrow.

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:53.096
You know she's still engaged.

01:18:53.098 --> 01:18:54.974
Yeah, I know.

01:19:09.534 --> 01:19:10.435
Good morning, we're here to discuss

01:19:10.437 --> 01:19:12.306
an encouraging scripture
from the Bible with you.

01:19:12.308 --> 01:19:14.265
Have you ever thought about living

01:19:14.267 --> 01:19:16.065
forever on a paradise earth?

01:19:16.067 --> 01:19:17.667
Good morning sir.

01:19:17.669 --> 01:19:19.002
We are offering the latest issues

01:19:19.004 --> 01:19:20.587
of these Bible based magazines.

01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:21.609
Not interest.

01:19:21.611 --> 01:19:23.519
Is it the Bible you're not
interested in or is it...

01:19:23.521 --> 01:19:24.849
Get the fuck off my property.

01:19:24.851 --> 01:19:26.502
Let me assure you, we're not here

01:19:26.504 --> 01:19:27.801
to change your religion today.

01:19:27.803 --> 01:19:28.775
Did you fucking hear me?

01:19:28.777 --> 01:19:29.610
Yes.

01:19:34.195 --> 01:19:35.672
Do you hate me?

01:19:35.674 --> 01:19:37.747
No.

01:19:37.749 --> 01:19:40.331
Then why'd you say it?

01:19:44.665 --> 01:19:46.190
I don't know.

01:19:52.656 --> 01:19:53.573
Hey, hey,

01:19:58.269 --> 01:19:59.409
it's been more than 20 minutes

01:19:59.411 --> 01:20:01.568
and I don't see them in there.

01:20:01.570 --> 01:20:03.239
We're gonna wait for them here.

01:20:03.241 --> 01:20:04.658
Are you crying?

01:20:05.943 --> 01:20:06.776
No.

01:20:11.272 --> 01:20:15.272
Come on, let's go to
your car, we missed them.

01:20:20.875 --> 01:20:22.375
Hey look, bowling.

01:20:23.334 --> 01:20:25.026
I'm bringing you home.

01:20:25.028 --> 01:20:26.467
Come on let's have some fun.

01:20:26.469 --> 01:20:27.475
No.

01:20:27.477 --> 01:20:28.823
It's a family sport, you like those.

01:20:28.825 --> 01:20:30.498
No.

01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:31.629
Come on let's go bowling.

01:20:31.631 --> 01:20:34.714
I can beat a girl at bowling any day.

01:20:50.552 --> 01:20:54.719
Not bad, not bad at all.

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:01.060
Two Diet Cokes.

01:21:01.062 --> 01:21:02.702
Thank you.

01:21:02.704 --> 01:21:04.121
You're welcome.

01:21:05.851 --> 01:21:07.824
Sorry, oh no, no, no.

01:21:07.826 --> 01:21:08.826
Here you go.

01:21:13.071 --> 01:21:14.006
Thank you.

01:21:14.008 --> 01:21:15.008
Thank you.

01:21:16.527 --> 01:21:17.945
You're welcome.

01:21:22.914 --> 01:21:23.922
So you went to he library a lot.

01:21:23.924 --> 01:21:26.316
When you were disfellowshipped.

01:21:26.318 --> 01:21:27.595
Yeah I did.

01:21:27.597 --> 01:21:29.659
I was actually, that was the strange

01:21:29.661 --> 01:21:31.153
part about being disfellowshipped.

01:21:31.155 --> 01:21:33.854
I got to learn about different writers

01:21:33.856 --> 01:21:35.856
and I got to read a lot.

01:21:40.419 --> 01:21:41.251
I um...

01:21:46.231 --> 01:21:47.919
I'm engaged.

01:21:47.921 --> 01:21:49.398
I know, I know.

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:52.350
I shouldn't be talking to you like this.

01:21:52.352 --> 01:21:53.184
I know.

01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:07.075
Oh wait I can't, I can't.

01:22:41.205 --> 01:22:42.971
We shouldn't do this.

01:22:42.973 --> 01:22:44.194
It's okay.

01:22:47.188 --> 01:22:50.320
Hey, get your ass up here,
I have a surprise for you.

01:22:50.322 --> 01:22:51.490
I'm at Beth's.

01:22:52.366 --> 01:22:53.533
Okay.

01:22:54.463 --> 01:22:55.468
I'm serious.

01:22:56.374 --> 01:22:57.524
Surprise, we're giving you the van.

01:22:57.526 --> 01:22:58.358
What?

01:23:03.219 --> 01:23:04.801
We're not using it anymore.

01:23:04.803 --> 01:23:06.385
We're taking the train to Seattle.

01:23:06.387 --> 01:23:08.684
I've got a car up there at my parents.

01:23:08.686 --> 01:23:10.815
Really, thanks.

01:23:10.817 --> 01:23:12.687
You're moving to Seattle?

01:23:12.689 --> 01:23:16.216
- Well we're.
- We're moving to Seattle.

01:23:16.218 --> 01:23:17.453
You haven't told him yet.

01:23:17.455 --> 01:23:18.730
Angela kicked us out.

01:23:18.732 --> 01:23:20.266
She caught us.

01:23:20.268 --> 01:23:21.779
But.

01:23:21.781 --> 01:23:24.350
It's okay, Beth knows we fucked.

01:23:26.604 --> 01:23:27.913
It didn't mean anything to you?

01:23:27.915 --> 01:23:29.997
Gabey, come on.

01:23:31.121 --> 01:23:31.954
Wow.

01:23:33.027 --> 01:23:36.694
Gabey, you'll always be my cousin.

01:23:40.432 --> 01:23:42.182
Have fun, I love you.

01:23:46.567 --> 01:23:49.296
The steering sticks and the
keys are in the ignition.

01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:01.543
Yo where's Peter?

01:24:01.545 --> 01:24:03.488
I don't know.

01:24:03.490 --> 01:24:05.091
I saw him at lunch.

01:24:05.093 --> 01:24:06.510
Magic feet, oh.

01:24:25.726 --> 01:24:26.726
Oh my god.

01:24:32.119 --> 01:24:32.954
Move, move.

01:24:36.201 --> 01:24:37.784
Move out of my way.

01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:47.962
Peter!

01:24:52.571 --> 01:24:53.821
Oh God, oh God!

01:25:02.522 --> 01:25:03.352
Oh God.

01:25:07.744 --> 01:25:08.576
Peter!

01:25:12.006 --> 01:25:13.430
Peter, Peter!

01:25:13.432 --> 01:25:15.931
Wake up, get up, Peter wake up!

01:25:15.933 --> 01:25:18.196
Wake up Peter, wake up!

01:25:18.198 --> 01:25:19.925
Somebody help!

01:25:19.927 --> 01:25:20.844
Fuck, fuck!

01:25:44.946 --> 01:25:45.882
Gabe!

01:25:45.884 --> 01:25:46.944
Yeah.

01:25:46.946 --> 01:25:49.028
Come on in here please.

01:25:52.054 --> 01:25:52.905
Have a seat pal.

01:26:00.088 --> 01:26:03.815
Sweetie you know how
sorry we are about Peter.

01:26:03.817 --> 01:26:06.480
If Peter said a prayer
to Jehovah after he hung

01:26:06.482 --> 01:26:09.845
himself before he died,
he'll be resurrected.

01:26:09.847 --> 01:26:13.097
You don't think he'll be resurrected?

01:26:16.369 --> 01:26:18.036
Suicide is murder.

01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:20.735
Did you read the letter that

01:26:20.737 --> 01:26:23.405
Peter sent, the apostasy letter?

01:26:24.572 --> 01:26:26.568
It's full of lies.

01:26:26.570 --> 01:26:28.349
What are you talking about?

01:26:28.351 --> 01:26:30.762
You know about the Malawi cover up right?

01:26:30.764 --> 01:26:32.707
Everybody makes mistakes.

01:26:32.709 --> 01:26:34.285
Even the governing body.

01:26:34.287 --> 01:26:35.994
But the governing body, they let these

01:26:35.996 --> 01:26:38.251
Jehovah Witnesses die.

01:26:38.253 --> 01:26:40.351
You know that they knew about it.

01:26:40.353 --> 01:26:41.543
That isn't...

01:26:41.545 --> 01:26:42.590
They knew.

01:26:42.592 --> 01:26:43.650
That is not the point.

01:26:43.652 --> 01:26:46.675
The point is, for our
family to stay together

01:26:46.677 --> 01:26:50.844
in paradise for eternity, we
need to focus on the future.

01:26:53.497 --> 01:26:54.628
The Malawi brothers and sisters

01:26:54.630 --> 01:26:57.364
will be taken care of
by Jehovah at Armageddon.

01:26:57.366 --> 01:26:58.842
- And it's not our business.
- Hello.

01:26:58.844 --> 01:27:01.578
Gabe it's Brother Miller.

01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:04.203
It's been brought to out
attention that you raped Jasmine.

01:27:04.205 --> 01:27:06.038
What, who said that?

01:27:06.995 --> 01:27:08.793
Well Jasmine told us,

01:27:08.795 --> 01:27:10.782
I need you to confirm the situation.

01:27:10.784 --> 01:27:12.128
Peter just died.

01:27:12.130 --> 01:27:12.963
I know.

01:27:13.924 --> 01:27:16.507
What is wrong with everybody?

01:27:19.245 --> 01:27:22.078
Dear Gabe, don't be mad.

01:27:23.170 --> 01:27:25.068
You probably say the letters I sent

01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:26.864
to everyone in the congregation

01:27:26.866 --> 01:27:28.726
about what we found out in Kien's book.

01:27:28.728 --> 01:27:31.364
They're disfellowshipping me.

01:27:31.366 --> 01:27:33.168
You probably found the watch already,

01:27:33.170 --> 01:27:34.944
please take care of it.

01:27:34.946 --> 01:27:37.445
It's a piece of me that's always with you.

01:27:37.447 --> 01:27:40.065
Good luck with Jasmine, hope

01:27:40.067 --> 01:27:41.904
to see you guys after Armageddon.

01:27:41.906 --> 01:27:42.823
I love you.

01:27:44.946 --> 01:27:45.779
Hey.

01:27:51.629 --> 01:27:55.547
I heard about what
happened, I'm really sorry.

01:27:55.549 --> 01:27:56.382
Thanks.

01:27:58.370 --> 01:28:01.510
Do you want some company?

01:28:01.512 --> 01:28:02.344
Sure.

01:28:16.969 --> 01:28:21.137
I don't think I can be a
Jehovah's Witness much longer.

01:28:26.272 --> 01:28:29.789
I'm sorry, if I can do
anything for you I...

01:28:29.791 --> 01:28:32.041
No, I gotta do something.

01:28:35.429 --> 01:28:37.679
Wait, I'll come with you.

01:28:39.615 --> 01:28:42.793
You shouldn't be alone right now.

01:28:44.613 --> 01:28:45.614
Where's Jasmine.

01:28:45.616 --> 01:28:46.611
What are you doing here?

01:28:46.613 --> 01:28:47.651
Peter just hung himself.

01:28:47.653 --> 01:28:48.894
Did you read the letter?

01:28:48.896 --> 01:28:50.507
Camille!

01:28:50.509 --> 01:28:52.590
Hey, you don't go near her again!

01:28:52.592 --> 01:28:53.759
I raped you?

01:28:54.613 --> 01:28:56.669
You shouldn't be here.

01:28:56.671 --> 01:28:58.430
The elders know everything.

01:28:58.432 --> 01:29:00.153
They know you forced yourself on her.

01:29:00.155 --> 01:29:02.365
She said don't but you kept going.

01:29:02.367 --> 01:29:03.629
Is that true?

01:29:03.631 --> 01:29:04.793
Is that what happened?

01:29:12.330 --> 01:29:13.163
I'm sorry.

01:29:14.250 --> 01:29:16.110
It's too late to say sorry to her.

01:29:16.112 --> 01:29:17.849
The only reason I'm not breaking your face

01:29:17.851 --> 01:29:19.507
is because you're getting
disfellowshipped again.

01:29:19.509 --> 01:29:20.855
And because we want want to have

01:29:20.857 --> 01:29:23.113
our wedding at Kingdom Hall.

01:29:23.115 --> 01:29:24.410
Getting a worldly girl now Gabe?

01:29:24.412 --> 01:29:26.989
Yeah, that'll be great
for you committee meeting.

01:29:26.991 --> 01:29:28.069
What did you say?

01:29:28.071 --> 01:29:29.150
Let's go.

01:29:29.152 --> 01:29:30.153
I said it would be great

01:29:30.155 --> 01:29:31.230
for your committee meeting.

01:29:31.232 --> 01:29:32.233
Come on, knock it off.

01:29:32.235 --> 01:29:33.248
Jesus.

01:29:33.250 --> 01:29:34.312
You don't want to do this.

01:29:34.314 --> 01:29:35.412
Let's go.

01:29:49.915 --> 01:29:52.248
Sorry this door is always broken.

01:29:52.250 --> 01:29:53.250
It's fine.

01:29:56.494 --> 01:29:59.489
Well thank you for the ride.

01:29:59.491 --> 01:30:00.491
Thank you.

01:30:05.255 --> 01:30:09.338
Listen I'm definitely
here for you as a friend.

01:30:11.469 --> 01:30:13.052
But, not like that.

01:30:20.119 --> 01:30:20.989
Hey, you better be careful

01:30:20.991 --> 01:30:21.821
so you don't get in trouble.

01:30:21.823 --> 01:30:22.992
I don't care if I get in trouble.

01:30:22.994 --> 01:30:24.912
You should, Jehovah will help you.

01:30:24.914 --> 01:30:26.331
Oh really, how?

01:30:27.170 --> 01:30:28.670
You read the book.

01:30:33.874 --> 01:30:35.194
What else is there?

01:30:35.196 --> 01:30:37.613
I don't know, I don't know.

01:30:40.528 --> 01:30:42.788
Yeah you don't, hey.

01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:43.620
What?

01:30:43.622 --> 01:30:44.552
Lets just be careful.

01:30:44.554 --> 01:30:46.051
What the fuck are you talking 'bout?

01:30:46.053 --> 01:30:47.672
Hey, hey, we can do this.

01:30:47.674 --> 01:30:49.694
Okay, we can do this for
Peter, we'll just be good.

01:30:49.696 --> 01:30:51.778
No, don't you say that.

01:30:53.410 --> 01:30:55.069
Let's just try to be good.

01:30:55.071 --> 01:30:56.071
Don't say that.

01:30:56.073 --> 01:30:57.191
It's not going to be all that bad!

01:30:57.193 --> 01:30:59.193
Don't say that!

01:31:09.293 --> 01:31:10.907

01:31:36.173 --> 01:31:40.340
