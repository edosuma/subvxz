00:10.470 --> 00:15.391
<i>NARRATOR". What's this? An ambush outside
the home of millionaire Karnaby Katz?</i>

00:15.600 --> 00:18.394
<i>Where Catwoman, the Joker,
and their evil cohorts...</i>

00:18.603 --> 00:23.066
<i>...lie wickedly in wait for Batgirl
and the Caped Crusaders.</i>

00:23.274 --> 00:26.110
Where will we get in touch with you
in case we find more clues?

00:26.319 --> 00:28.404
Where can I get in touch with you, Batman?

00:28.613 --> 00:31.783
Yes, that has been a problem,
but we'll manage.

00:31.991 --> 00:34.244
We have before.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:49.592 --> 00:52.095
Looking for something, Batgirl?

00:52.303 --> 00:54.764
Like this spark plug, perhaps?

00:54.973 --> 00:56.182
So you didn't leave.

00:56.391 --> 01:01.271
Not only didn't we leave,
but neither did our dependable Cats Paws.

01:14.450 --> 01:17.161
Won't she break through that thin twine,
Catwoman?

01:17.370 --> 01:19.038
I think not, Joker.

01:19.247 --> 01:22.917
Those Cat's Whiskers,
a fiendish invention of mine...

01:23.126 --> 01:27.130
...they automatically contract when placed
in close contact with the heat of the body.

01:30.800 --> 01:34.971
So in seconds,
Batgirl will be strangled to death...

01:35.179 --> 01:40.602
...thereby ridding Gotham City
of one-third of the Terrific Trio.

01:40.810 --> 01:44.522
You see, when I do a job, I do it right.

01:45.064 --> 01:47.900
And why didn't we attack them all
while we were at it?

01:48.109 --> 01:50.862
There are only four of us and three of them.

01:51.779 --> 01:55.617
The odds would be most perturbing.

01:55.825 --> 01:57.118
Finished?

01:57.327 --> 01:58.661
Yes, Catwoman.

01:58.870 --> 02:01.080
Soon, so is she. Ha-ha-ha!

02:01.748 --> 02:07.170
Let's get back to the novelty company
and plan our next cataclysmic move.

03:52.650 --> 03:53.818
<i>NARRATOR".
Free at last...</i>

03:54.026 --> 03:57.530
<i>...as the sprinkling system
has caused the Cat Whiskers to expand...</i>

03:57.739 --> 03:59.782
. . . <i>rather than contract.</i>

04:22.680 --> 04:25.475
You both look a trifle harassed, sir,
if I may say so.

04:25.683 --> 04:26.976
Perhaps this snack will help.

04:27.185 --> 04:30.646
No, thank you, Alfred. You know I never mix
crime-fighting with eating.

04:30.855 --> 04:34.025
Besides, I don't think it'll help us
solve our problem...

04:34.233 --> 04:37.320
...with Catwoman and Joker.
-I could force myself to take a bite.

04:42.366 --> 04:44.994
- Yes, commissioner?
-Batgirl just called me, Batman.

04:45.203 --> 04:49.665
She wants you to meet her at the intersection
of Cattail Lane and Ninelives Alley.

04:49.874 --> 04:52.084
That's behind
the novelty manufacturing center...

04:52.293 --> 04:54.337
...of Gotham City.
-She's on the other phone.

04:54.545 --> 04:56.798
- Shall I tell her you'll be there?
-By all means.

04:57.006 --> 04:58.508
Right.

04:58.716 --> 05:01.552
Cattail Lane, Ninelives Alley.

05:01.761 --> 05:04.555
The Grimalkin Novelty Company
is on that corner.

05:04.764 --> 05:07.141
Grimalkin? What kind of a name is that?

05:07.350 --> 05:12.313
An obscure, but nevertheless acceptable,
synonym for "cat," Robin.

05:12.522 --> 05:14.065
Let's go.

05:16.067 --> 05:19.779
<i>NARRATOR". While the Dynamic Duo
race back to Gotham City...</i>

05:19.987 --> 05:24.283
<i>Catwoman and Joker
have already put their plan into motion.</i>

05:24.951 --> 05:28.913
This is the map which will lead us
to the gunpowder hidden over 200 years ago...

05:29.121 --> 05:33.042
...by Gargon Maltese, the famous crook.

05:33.251 --> 05:35.002
This nightshirt is a map?

05:35.211 --> 05:37.380
It's perfectly obvious, Joker.

05:37.588 --> 05:40.716
And thanks to it,
we shall steal the gunpowder...

05:40.925 --> 05:45.096
...then blast our way in and out
of the federal depository.

05:45.471 --> 05:47.890
Well, it's a funny map
without any printing on it.

05:48.099 --> 05:50.726
It's the shape that's persuasive.

05:50.935 --> 05:57.400
This is a chart of Phony Island,
located on the southern tip of Gotham City.

05:57.608 --> 06:01.612
Oh, and that X mark's the leeward end,
and that's where the stuff is, right?

06:01.821 --> 06:04.448
Wrong. X does not mark the spot.

06:04.907 --> 06:06.450
It's the starting place.

06:07.076 --> 06:10.705
To find the exact location,
we must look at the crib.

06:10.913 --> 06:15.793
It's written backwards and,
heh-heh, in French.

06:16.002 --> 06:17.587
Giggler, get my mirror.

06:17.795 --> 06:22.133
Laugher, get my French dictionary.

06:35.605 --> 06:39.108
Ooh. That's the first time I ever heard
a cat purr in French.

06:39.317 --> 06:41.986
Skip the flattery, Joker,
and give me the translation.

06:42.278 --> 06:49.285
Oh. "From X on the map,
walk 50 meters north, then 50 feet right...

06:49.660 --> 06:53.998
...then try to find the wrong stone."

06:54.290 --> 06:55.958
Now, what's that supposed to mean?

06:56.167 --> 06:58.419
Exactly the opposite of what it says.

06:58.753 --> 07:00.963
The poem said it's a fib.

07:01.172 --> 07:07.929
Therefore, we walk 50 meters south,
then 50 feet left...

07:08.137 --> 07:09.972
...to find the right stone.

07:10.181 --> 07:13.017
Oh, it's easy when you know the key.

07:13.225 --> 07:14.977
Well, shall we go?

07:15.186 --> 07:17.772
We shall, Joker.

07:31.327 --> 07:33.955
- How about rushing the place, Batman?
-Shh.

07:34.163 --> 07:35.998
I think not, Robin.

07:36.207 --> 07:41.629
All they've done so far is stolen a few items,
attempted to kill you, me and Batgirl.

07:41.837 --> 07:45.007
No, I think they plan something really big.

07:45.216 --> 07:46.509
Here they come.

07:46.717 --> 07:48.719
Meet us there, boys.
The Kitty Car only holds two.

07:55.685 --> 07:57.186
- They're getting away.
-No, Robin.

07:57.395 --> 08:00.439
I've adjusted the radar on the Batmobile
to allow us to trace them.

08:00.648 --> 08:03.025
By tuning in on sonic emanations
from their motor...

08:03.234 --> 08:05.736
...we'll be able to stay
up to five miles behind them...

08:05.945 --> 08:08.364
...and still know precisely where they are.

08:11.283 --> 08:14.245
We'll stay out of their sight
until they reach their destination.

08:14.453 --> 08:16.956
Then and only then will we pounce on them.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.207
To the Batmobile.

08:18.416 --> 08:21.377
What about my Batgirl Cycle?
It's hidden around the corner.

08:21.585 --> 08:23.713
We'll pick it up later, Batgirl.

08:23.921 --> 08:26.132
It'll be much faster if we all go together.

08:26.340 --> 08:28.634
Hmm. Cozy.

08:32.429 --> 08:34.347
<i>NARRATOR".
Meanwhile, Catwoman and Joker...</i>

08:34.557 --> 08:36.851
<i>...arrive at the Phony Island Lighthouse.</i>

08:37.058 --> 08:42.148
<i>Formerly, a busy bastion of light,
but now almost inoperative.</i>

08:44.442 --> 08:47.361
Look for something marked with an X.

08:50.698 --> 08:54.285
I found it. I found it.
I found the rock with the X mark.

08:57.163 --> 08:59.248
Aha. Good.

08:59.457 --> 09:05.337
From here on in, it should be a piece of cake.
Now, 50 meters south and 50 feet left.

09:07.465 --> 09:11.594
You know, the only trouble
with keeping this lighthouse, Mr. Keeper...

09:11.802 --> 09:14.972
...is that there isn't enough
for a lighthouse keeper to keep keeping.

09:15.181 --> 09:17.308
Mrs. Keeper, I'm the lighthouse keeper.

09:17.516 --> 09:19.935
- You just keep the lighthouse clean.
-Clean?

09:20.144 --> 09:22.438
All I do is vacuum the upstairs bedroom.

09:22.646 --> 09:26.692
What kind of life is that for a stylish, attractive,
sophisticated, intelligent woman?

09:26.901 --> 09:30.154
Mrs. Keeper, when you married me,
you know'd I was a lighthouse keeper.

09:30.362 --> 09:33.866
- You know'd it'd be a lonely life.
-I thought it sounded romantic.

09:34.075 --> 09:37.078
But there's nothing romantic
about shipwrecks and seagulls.

09:37.286 --> 09:39.663
Mrs. Keeper,
we haven't had a shipwreck in two days.

09:39.872 --> 09:43.125
Of course, we haven't.
The light's out in the lighthouse half the time.

09:43.334 --> 09:46.128
You'd think a lighthouse keeper
would know how to keep his--

09:46.337 --> 09:48.255
- Just stop talking.
-Stop talking?

09:48.464 --> 09:51.634
Then I'd really have nothing to do
except vacuum the upstairs bedroom.

09:51.842 --> 09:53.636
Well, at least stop talking to me.

09:53.844 --> 09:55.513
Here, you can talk to our visitors.

09:55.721 --> 09:56.972
Visitors? What visitors?

09:57.181 --> 10:00.267
There's a whole bunch of strangers
headed in our direction.

10:00.476 --> 10:04.230
Forty-six, 47, 48, 49, 50.

10:04.438 --> 10:06.941
Now 50 feet left.

10:07.149 --> 10:09.652
One, two, three, four...

10:09.860 --> 10:11.904
Well, what do you know? Company.

10:12.113 --> 10:14.532
I'd better get back upstairs
and vacuum the bedroom.

10:14.740 --> 10:17.118
Vacuum the bedroom?
What are you going up there for?

10:17.326 --> 10:20.329
Every five minutes,
you're going upstairs to do some vacuuming.

10:20.746 --> 10:24.875
Forty-six, 47, 48, 49, 50.

10:25.084 --> 10:27.586
Should be around here somewhere
unless I counted wrong.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.755
Maybe feet were smaller in those days.

10:32.591 --> 10:34.218
You sure you figured everything?

10:34.718 --> 10:36.470
I never make a mistake.

10:38.514 --> 10:40.182
Look what we found upstairs.

10:40.391 --> 10:42.518
Unhand me, you underhanded bully.

10:42.726 --> 10:44.186
Well, what do we have here?

10:44.395 --> 10:48.190
I am the lighthouse keeper.
This is my missus, Mrs. Keeper.

10:48.399 --> 10:50.609
And this is private property.

10:50.818 --> 10:53.696
A lighthouse? Private property?
Oh-ho-ho!

10:53.904 --> 10:56.699
Well, private public property.

10:56.907 --> 10:58.701
It means you keep off!

10:58.909 --> 11:01.120
I think we've heard enough.

11:01.912 --> 11:03.747
Let's get them.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.878
No. You're kaput.

11:09.086 --> 11:10.129
Finis, defunct.

11:10.337 --> 11:13.424
We're very much not defunct, Joker.
Neither is Batgirl.

11:13.757 --> 11:17.803
This is some sort of perfidious trick.
I'll bet it's done with mirrors.

11:18.012 --> 11:21.640
The mirror is broken, Catwoman.
The last cat has crossed our path.

11:21.849 --> 11:24.101
From now on, all the luck is with us.

11:24.310 --> 11:26.896
Unhand those two helpless people.

11:30.274 --> 11:33.736
Look. There it is. The gunpowder.

11:36.655 --> 11:37.740
It's all clearly marked.

11:37.948 --> 11:41.368
- Gunpowder?
- Put that match out, you fool.

11:43.454 --> 11:44.496
It's going to explode.

11:44.705 --> 11:46.707
- Let's get out of here.
-There's no time.

11:47.625 --> 11:49.835
Stay calm, everybody.

11:50.085 --> 11:51.545
Stay calm, everyone.

12:00.095 --> 12:02.681
Holy return from oblivion. We're still alive.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.558
Yes, Robin. Still alive.

12:04.767 --> 12:08.145
In the split second before the actual detonation
of the gunpowder...

12:08.354 --> 12:12.316
...I was able to infuse this one room
with Anti-Blast Batpowder.

12:12.524 --> 12:14.109
Oh, very clever.

12:14.318 --> 12:15.361
I should say so.

12:15.569 --> 12:19.073
But what about the upstairs bedroom?
I just vacuumed it.

12:19.281 --> 12:22.451
The city will make it up to you.
They'll take the cost of your home...

12:22.660 --> 12:26.205
...out of Catwoman and Joker's prison pay
for making license plates.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.998
That's what you say, Batman.

12:28.207 --> 12:30.709
But I say we'll never see
the inside of a prison again.

12:30.918 --> 12:35.089
We're certainly never gonna see the inside
of the federal depository and all that dough.

12:35.297 --> 12:36.382
Maybe later, Joker.

12:36.590 --> 12:40.678
But for now, I want benefit of counsel.

12:40.886 --> 12:42.930
That's certainly your privilege, Catwoman.

12:43.138 --> 12:45.641
Can I make my one phone call?

12:45.849 --> 12:47.810
Just don't try any of your old tricks.

12:48.018 --> 12:49.144
Who are you calling?

12:49.353 --> 12:53.315
Lucky Pierre, the world's greatest
and luckiest criminal attorney.

12:53.524 --> 12:55.484
He's never lost a case.

12:55.693 --> 12:58.320
- Is it a toll call?
-No.

12:58.529 --> 13:00.364
Only local.

13:03.617 --> 13:06.829
This dime should take care
of the telephone call, Mrs. Keeper.

13:07.037 --> 13:10.291
Thanks, Batman. You're a perfect gentleman.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.963
Hello, Pierre.

13:16.171 --> 13:17.673
This is Catwoman.

13:17.881 --> 13:21.051
C-A-T-W-O-M -A-N.

13:27.099 --> 13:30.269
Batman just caught Joker and me
in the middle of a robbery.

13:30.477 --> 13:34.815
Hmm. Difficult, but not insurmountable
for Lucky Pierre.

13:35.024 --> 13:38.110
Now, be still and don't utter a meow.

13:38.319 --> 13:39.737
I'll see you in court.

13:39.945 --> 13:42.990
And if all goes well, knock on wood...

13:43.407 --> 13:46.910
...I'll have you sprung
before pussy-willow time.

13:54.710 --> 13:56.837
Not good, huh?

13:57.046 --> 13:59.882
Listen, Joker,
according to the pretrial briefs...

14:00.090 --> 14:03.719
...there's no way any jury in this world
would fail to convict you.

14:03.927 --> 14:05.679
Any jury?

14:05.888 --> 14:08.390
Well, almost any jury.

14:08.599 --> 14:12.519
To beat this rap, you'd have to bribe
every citizen of Gotham City.

14:12.728 --> 14:16.065
And that takes dough. Real dough.

14:16.273 --> 14:18.567
Has the jury been chosen yet?

14:18.776 --> 14:21.403
Batman is in the anteroom,
interviewing them now.

14:21.612 --> 14:23.530
- Batman?
-Yeah, Batman.

14:23.739 --> 14:28.327
Because of his familiarity with the case, the DA
has allowed him to handle the prosecution.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.704
But I get my chance in a few minutes.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.513
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

14:47.721 --> 14:49.807
Uh, gentlemen of the jury...

14:50.015 --> 14:53.644
...we are gathered here today
to prove that Catwoman...

14:54.311 --> 14:57.064
...Joker, and their men...

14:57.272 --> 14:59.775
...are guilty of several major offenses.

14:59.983 --> 15:03.779
To wit: robbery, attempted murder...

15:03.987 --> 15:07.825
...assault and battery, mayhem...

15:08.033 --> 15:11.245
...and overtime parking.

15:12.329 --> 15:16.834
I would like to call as my first witness,
Little Louie Groovy.

15:17.209 --> 15:20.546
Sure knows how to handle himself
in the courtroom, commissioner.

15:20.754 --> 15:23.006
Little Louie Groovy, take the stand.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.136
Would you state your full name, please?

15:28.846 --> 15:30.180
Little Louie Groovy.

15:30.389 --> 15:34.059
Mr. Groovy,
on the night of July 22nd of this year...

15:34.268 --> 15:37.187
...were you not robbed
of a very valuable nightshirt?

15:37.396 --> 15:40.941
And was not assault
committed upon your personage?

15:41.150 --> 15:42.484
Yeah.

15:42.693 --> 15:47.448
Are the persons who performed these
dastardly deeds present in this courtroom?

15:47.656 --> 15:48.740
Yeah.

15:48.949 --> 15:52.369
For the record,
would you point them out, please?

15:54.371 --> 15:56.165
Those cats over there.

15:56.373 --> 16:01.336
The chick with the swinging outfit, the creep
with the green hair, and those four clowns.

16:01.545 --> 16:06.884
For the record,
witness is pointing to the defendants.

16:08.010 --> 16:09.887
He's so authoritative.

16:10.095 --> 16:11.430
So confident.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.433
The more you work with Batman,
the more amazing he seems.

16:14.641 --> 16:15.851
Cross-examination?

16:16.059 --> 16:17.478
No cross-examination.

16:19.188 --> 16:21.815
I now call Karnaby Katz to the stand.

16:24.568 --> 16:25.736
No cross-examination.

16:29.281 --> 16:34.912
I call as my final witnesses,
Mr. and Mrs. Keeper.

16:39.374 --> 16:41.335
And that's your statement, Mr. Keeper.

16:41.543 --> 16:44.087
That's his statement, not mine.

16:44.296 --> 16:47.049
I had just vacuumed the upstairs bedroom.

16:47.257 --> 16:49.510
And now there's no bedroom upstairs
anymore.

16:49.718 --> 16:51.428
- Please, Mrs. Keeper--
-No.

16:51.637 --> 16:52.930
It's not any place.

16:53.138 --> 16:55.349
That's my statement.

16:55.557 --> 16:56.600
Cross-examination?

16:57.434 --> 16:58.602
No cross-examination.

17:01.188 --> 17:02.773
Thank you.

17:09.029 --> 17:11.031
I can't understand his tactics.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.867
He hasn't cross-examined
one of my witnesses.

17:14.076 --> 17:18.247
He has something up his sleeve, all right.
They don't call him "Lucky Pierre" for nothing.

17:18.454 --> 17:22.084
This is ridiculous.
Aren't you gonna offer some sort of defense?

17:22.291 --> 17:24.670
- I know what I'm doing, Joker.
-Oh!

17:24.877 --> 17:26.505
You're doing fine, Lucky.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.715
Keep your cool.

17:34.638 --> 17:36.056
Batman's about to sum up.

17:37.724 --> 17:38.850
Gentlemen of the jury...

17:39.059 --> 17:42.271
...you've heard the evidence
of 14 separate witnesses...

17:42.479 --> 17:46.108
...including Robin the Boy Wonder,
and Batgirl.

17:46.316 --> 17:49.486
Each one of them
corroborating the other's story...

17:49.695 --> 17:52.739
...that those defendants are guilty...

17:52.948 --> 17:57.327
...of all the crimes
with which they are charged.

17:58.203 --> 18:00.831
In the interests of law, order...

18:01.540 --> 18:06.378
...justice, good fellowship, and the flag...

18:06.587 --> 18:09.131
...you must convict them...

18:09.339 --> 18:14.136
...to keep our streets safe from evil persons.

18:14.344 --> 18:16.013
Thank you.

18:18.348 --> 18:20.851
- You were great, Batman.
-Sit down, Robin. Thank you.

18:21.059 --> 18:24.354
- Yes, you learned your lessons well, Batman.
-Begorra.

18:26.356 --> 18:28.150
Lucky Pierre is standing.

18:28.358 --> 18:30.736
He's gonna let us have it now.

18:30.944 --> 18:33.655
The defense waives summation in this case.

18:34.114 --> 18:36.658
We stand on our plea of not guilty...

18:36.867 --> 18:42.039
...and we feel sure
that the jury will bear out the truth in this case.

18:42.831 --> 18:44.458
So be it.

18:44.791 --> 18:48.545
Jury's ordered to the jury room
for deliberation.

18:48.920 --> 18:52.382
No need for that, Your Honor.
We have already made up our minds.

18:53.717 --> 18:54.885
That's a good sign.

18:55.093 --> 18:58.347
This should be some sort of legal record
for convictions by a jury.

18:58.555 --> 19:01.058
We find the defendants, Catwoman...

19:01.391 --> 19:05.354
...Joker, Giggler, Laughter,
Smiley and Gus...

19:05.562 --> 19:07.773
...not guilty of any of the charges.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.149
Yeah.

19:09.358 --> 19:10.400
Yeah.

19:14.237 --> 19:15.781
Yeah.

19:15.989 --> 19:18.533
Order in the court. Order, I say.

19:22.579 --> 19:25.666
There's something very cat-fishy
about this whole thing, Batman.

19:25.874 --> 19:28.669
- I think it's a fix.
-That's the way the law is, Robin.

19:28.877 --> 19:31.672
They've received a fair trial
and been adjudged not guilty.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.924
Every man is entitled to his day in court.

19:34.132 --> 19:37.094
We must abide by the jury's decision.

19:40.430 --> 19:45.102
Normally, after any case,
I never make a statement to the jury.

19:45.769 --> 19:49.189
However, today, I cannot resist.

19:49.398 --> 19:52.818
Never in my 30 years
on the Gotham City bench...

19:53.026 --> 19:58.115
...have I ever seen a more callous disregard
for the facts in a case.

19:58.323 --> 20:02.244
You are all to be chastised
for making a travesty...

20:02.452 --> 20:04.454
...out of the judicial process.

20:05.288 --> 20:09.042
Aw, stow it, judge. The case is over.
Quit flapping your yap.

20:10.460 --> 20:11.962
Yeah.

20:12.170 --> 20:15.716
That's no foreman, that's Marvin the Moose.
He used to work with Catwoman.

20:15.924 --> 20:18.385
And that second fellow is Dave the Dummy.

20:18.593 --> 20:20.971
He's also worked with Catwoman.

20:21.430 --> 20:23.932
Your Honor, I move for a new trial.

20:24.141 --> 20:27.644
- On which of several grounds?
-On the grounds of a prejudicial jury.

20:27.853 --> 20:30.439
You don't know how prejudicial, Batman.

20:30.647 --> 20:32.315
All right, now.

22:00.153 --> 22:02.739
- What now?
-You're on your way to prison, Catwoman.

22:03.865 --> 22:07.577
Will you never learn
that you cannot outwit the law?

22:07.786 --> 22:11.414
Maybe one day I will, Batman, perhaps.

22:11.623 --> 22:14.876
You'll never succeed in circumventing justice,
Catwoman.

22:15.085 --> 22:18.672
Not as long as honest and dedicated
law enforcers have a breath left.

22:18.880 --> 22:24.553
Oh, forget the morals. Just get us back to jail,
so we don't have to listen to these corny jokes.

22:24.761 --> 22:27.222
But morals are the stuff men are made of.

22:27.430 --> 22:30.350
And until criminals learn that,
our job will not be done.

22:30.559 --> 22:34.604
However, if and when they do...

22:34.813 --> 22:39.317
...we'll be only too ready
to hang up our capes and cowls.

23:06.928 --> 23:09.139
At least we met
some very interesting characters.

23:09.347 --> 23:13.184
Little Louie Groovy, Karnaby Katz,
Mr. and Mrs. Keeper.

23:13.393 --> 23:14.769
Don't forget Lucky Pierre.

23:14.978 --> 23:16.271
- Yeah.
-Yes.

23:16.479 --> 23:21.443
If he hadn't gone so wrong,
he might have had to find career in politics.

23:21.651 --> 23:24.821
Won a gubernatorial race,
or the White House even.

23:25.030 --> 23:26.781
I guess it just wasn't in the books.

23:26.990 --> 23:29.951
Speaking of books,
I promised I'd call my daughter at the library.

23:30.160 --> 23:32.078
- Ah.
-Bonnie?

23:32.287 --> 23:34.664
<i>NARRATOR".
While at the library:</i>

23:34.873 --> 23:36.833
Louie the Lilac.

23:37.042 --> 23:39.085
What are you doing here?

23:39.294 --> 23:41.630
And what are you doing
with that boutonniere?

23:41.838 --> 23:44.716
I remember the time you stunned
my friend Princess Primrose...

23:44.925 --> 23:46.718
...with an invisible knockout spray.

23:46.927 --> 23:49.679
This is not an invisible knockout spray,
Miss Gordon.

23:49.888 --> 23:52.057
It is essence of lilacs.

23:52.265 --> 23:57.729
A scent which I intend to corner
the perfume market of Gotham City.

23:58.688 --> 24:03.485
I thought that the police commissioner's
daughter should be my first recipient.

24:14.037 --> 24:16.081
Gotham Public Library.

24:16.289 --> 24:18.667
Oh, Daddy, am I glad you called.

24:18.875 --> 24:20.835
You'll never guess who was just in here.

24:21.044 --> 24:23.630
Louie the Lilac?

24:23.838 --> 24:26.132
Back in Gotham City?

24:26.341 --> 24:29.928
<i>NARRATOR". And Louie the Lilac is in indeed
back in Gotham City...</i>

24:30.136 --> 24:33.723
<i>...and planning much more
than just cornering the perfume market...</i>

24:33.932 --> 24:37.394
<i>...as you'll see in our next episode.</i>
