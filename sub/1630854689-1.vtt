00:51.333 --> 00:54.083


01:05.708 --> 01:09.166
Please, take care of him.

02:19.125 --> 02:21.541


02:23.750 --> 02:25.416
Turn off the lights.

03:29.916 --> 03:31.250


03:31.333 --> 03:33.208
-

03:45.750 --> 03:47.333
Come on.

03:47.416 --> 03:48.416
Careful.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.208
I think your girlfriend
wants sunglasses now.

06:59.291 --> 07:01.791
No? Sunglasses for the beautiful woman.

07:31.958 --> 07:34.666
Can you take care of Thanasis?

07:34.750 --> 07:36.416


07:36.500 --> 07:37.500
Please.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.166
-Yes, of course.
-I need to go to hospital.

07:41.250 --> 07:42.375
Okay.

08:41.833 --> 08:43.541
-Is he okay?
-Yes.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.375
He is healthy and all clean.

08:46.958 --> 08:48.125
He's perfect.

08:48.625 --> 08:51.458
Is there any way
to contact your husband, Veronica?

08:51.958 --> 08:55.000
Uh, he's working in Árgos.
There's no telephone.

08:55.083 --> 08:56.416
He's going to get a surprise.

08:56.500 --> 08:59.000
Yes, he will.

08:59.083 --> 09:03.708
I just need some more information for the,
uh, Universal Health Service paperwork.

09:03.791 --> 09:06.083
I can never remember it.

09:06.166 --> 09:09.083
It's okay.
I will take a copy of your residency card.

09:09.166 --> 09:12.083
It's at home.
I was at work when I went into labor.

09:14.291 --> 09:15.625
Okay.

09:19.666 --> 09:20.666
Here.

10:42.958 --> 10:44.541
How was your trip?

10:48.125 --> 10:49.125
Very long.

10:52.500 --> 10:54.250
How have things been here?

10:55.416 --> 10:56.500
Oh, uneventful.

11:07.791 --> 11:08.791
Vera?

11:19.625 --> 11:22.208
You only have to think about
what's in front of you.

11:24.250 --> 11:25.500
Vera, I have another son.

11:38.083 --> 11:41.041
Thanasis Rotimi,
look at your baby brother.

11:41.625 --> 11:43.583
Look at your baby brother. Look.

11:44.958 --> 11:47.125
Friends come and go, but family's forever.

11:47.708 --> 11:48.791
You hear me?

11:48.875 --> 11:51.750
-Huh?
-You will never be alone.

11:58.750 --> 12:00.416
What shall you call him?

12:01.541 --> 12:05.375
Giannis. In Greek, it means "John,"
like the apostle.

12:06.333 --> 12:09.583
And Ugo in Ibo means "a crown."

12:10.583 --> 12:13.083
A crown that God has given,
nobody can take away.

12:13.166 --> 12:14.666
-Amen.
-Amen.

12:14.750 --> 12:16.458
-Amen.
-Amen.

12:43.291 --> 12:45.250
Sorry. You misspelled our last name.

12:47.458 --> 12:50.375
-There's too many letters.
-"Antetokounmpo."

12:50.458 --> 12:51.958
Adetokunbo.

12:52.541 --> 12:54.541
Antetokounmpo?

12:54.625 --> 12:56.500
-Adetokunbo.
-Excuse me, Ms. Pantazis?

12:56.583 --> 12:57.833
Tell them I'll be a minute.

12:57.916 --> 13:01.208
Are you sure we got it wrong?
Our translators are usually very good.

13:03.333 --> 13:05.958
We know our own name, Ms. Pantazis.

13:06.041 --> 13:08.916
It's Adetokunbo.
It's a very proud Yoruba name.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.125
It means "the king from across
the seas has returned."

13:12.208 --> 13:14.375
Okay, I'll make a note of it.

13:15.333 --> 13:18.166
Uh, did you bring your education history
and proof of current employment?

13:18.250 --> 13:19.250
Oh, yes.

13:19.333 --> 13:23.333
Uh, so, this is a letter
from the temp agency that gets us jobs.

13:30.833 --> 13:31.875
This isn't enough.

13:32.833 --> 13:35.875
You need to prove you're working legally,
on payroll.

13:36.875 --> 13:38.833
If you file
a residency application like this,

13:38.916 --> 13:42.416
it will be rejected on the basis
you entered Greece without permission.

13:42.500 --> 13:44.041
But we didn't choose to be illegal.

13:44.125 --> 13:47.875
Our passports were illegally confiscated
by the European police.

13:47.958 --> 13:50.750
We couldn't go back
because we had spent all of our savings.

13:50.833 --> 13:52.916
We had to cross the border.
You understand?

13:53.750 --> 13:56.916
Now, our boys are Greek.

13:58.791 --> 14:00.750
They need the rights that go with that.

14:01.916 --> 14:03.833
Stay hidden while we work this out.

14:04.666 --> 14:05.750
Excuse me.

14:09.875 --> 14:11.375
Wait, Ms. Pantazis?

14:12.958 --> 14:15.750
The longer we stay hidden,
the more likely we get caught.

14:15.833 --> 14:17.916
We just want to do the right thing.

14:18.416 --> 14:19.958
You can file for asylum status.

14:20.041 --> 14:22.958
Asylum?
No, no, we are immigrants, not refugees.

14:24.458 --> 14:25.458
Hmm?

14:25.541 --> 14:27.250
There was no war where we came from.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.208
If there was, we'd be refugees,
but there wasn't.

14:29.291 --> 14:32.333
Then find legal work.
Stop using temp agencies.

14:32.916 --> 14:36.708
Find a job that puts you on payroll
and gets you a Social Security number.

14:36.791 --> 14:39.041
That will qualify you for a work permit.

14:39.125 --> 14:40.625
You can open a bank account.

14:40.708 --> 14:44.500
We can take all that and present
a strong residency application, hmm?

14:45.083 --> 14:46.125
Ms. Pantazis,

14:47.291 --> 14:51.208
no one will give us a payroll job
without legal residency.

14:51.708 --> 14:55.250
And no one will give us residency
without a payroll job.

15:08.916 --> 15:09.916
Okay…

15:11.708 --> 15:13.958
Maybe sunglasses.

15:16.625 --> 15:18.250
Watch your brother, eh?

15:21.583 --> 15:23.500
You're not buying for you, Gianni.

15:23.583 --> 15:26.250
I know,
but how will I know people will like it

15:26.333 --> 15:29.000
and want to buy it
if I don't like it first?

15:29.083 --> 15:30.875
You're absolutely right.

15:30.958 --> 15:33.833
You have to believe in what you sell.

15:34.541 --> 15:37.458
But how about you keep this one
for you, huh?

15:38.625 --> 15:40.458
We buy only what we can sell.

15:41.083 --> 15:44.041
Sunglasses are good. Watches and--

15:44.125 --> 15:48.875
Alex, Kostas,
these rosary beads sell very well.

15:51.625 --> 15:53.125
Hi, would you like a--

15:54.083 --> 15:55.250
Excuse me?

15:56.708 --> 15:58.000
Anyone? Anyone?

16:00.833 --> 16:02.000
All right.

16:06.083 --> 16:07.708
They won't stop for me.

16:07.791 --> 16:09.291
They won't even look at me.

16:09.375 --> 16:10.625
Let me teach you something.

16:10.708 --> 16:12.708
The direct approach
might not work for you.

16:12.791 --> 16:14.625
You're not as handsome as me.

16:14.708 --> 16:17.333
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
Trust your big brother.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
You can't accept no.

16:19.083 --> 16:20.375
No means maybe.

16:20.458 --> 16:22.208
You're not selling this.
You're selling you.

16:22.291 --> 16:25.000
You have to find out
what each person is interested in.

16:25.750 --> 16:28.416
My brother sells
the best sunglasses in Greece!

16:33.250 --> 16:34.250
Huh?

16:34.333 --> 16:37.125
For you, two euros. Just two euro.

16:37.791 --> 16:40.625
Alex, Kostas, stay closer.

16:49.625 --> 16:51.208
-Look at this.
-Where did you get all of this?

16:51.291 --> 16:53.000
-We sold all our stuff.
-All of it?

16:53.083 --> 16:54.791
-Yes.
-Where's your hat?

16:54.875 --> 16:57.333
-I sold that too.
-Oh, my goodness.

16:58.625 --> 16:59.875
Mama, police!

17:07.500 --> 17:09.458
-Ugo, leave it.
-We can't leave all this!

17:09.541 --> 17:10.666
Rotimi, grab Kostas!

17:15.166 --> 17:16.375
Mom!

17:16.875 --> 17:18.458
Ugo! Rotimi!

18:05.000 --> 18:06.750
-I am winning!

18:07.375 --> 18:09.375
Right. You click it now.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.791
Mama, I can't see! Thano's going to score!

18:13.875 --> 18:14.875
Sorry, Ugo.

18:14.958 --> 18:16.625
He's gonna score anyway.

18:20.541 --> 18:21.666
Over there!

18:27.666 --> 18:29.916
-My boys!
-Papa!

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
-Oh, yeah?
-Papa!

18:31.083 --> 18:33.166
Four to one! I will defeat you all.

18:33.250 --> 18:34.791
I will defeat you all.

18:34.875 --> 18:38.083
Oh, no! I grossly misjudged the situation.

18:40.500 --> 18:43.000
Okay, let me go and say hello
and goodbye to Mommy.

18:44.875 --> 18:46.333
-Oh! Ow.

18:46.416 --> 18:48.583
-I need the ball! Now!
-Mommy.

18:48.666 --> 18:49.666
Oh, no.

18:50.791 --> 18:52.500
You bought a soccer ball?

18:52.583 --> 18:53.875
Eh, the old one burst.

18:56.333 --> 18:58.125
I need to buy groceries.

18:58.208 --> 18:59.541
We also have to pay rent.

18:59.625 --> 19:00.875
Bamidele wants it today.

19:00.958 --> 19:03.041
Ah. Don't worry. I didn't spend too much.

19:05.125 --> 19:06.291
I promise.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.500
Are you going to tell them
they can't have it? Hmm?

19:12.583 --> 19:14.958
-Pass it.
-Pass it. Pass it! Pass it!

19:15.041 --> 19:16.750
-Pass it!

19:17.791 --> 19:19.083
Pass it! Pass it!

19:19.166 --> 19:21.666
-I'll shop smart. We'll be okay.
-Pass to me! Pass to me!

19:21.750 --> 19:22.750
Okay.

19:22.833 --> 19:24.666
I have to go to work now. I'll be late.

19:24.750 --> 19:25.750
Uh-uh.

19:26.708 --> 19:29.125
-I'll miss you.
-Pass to me. Pass it to me.

19:30.500 --> 19:33.375
-Ow!
-No ball in the house, Kostas.

19:33.458 --> 19:36.250
I made plantain and yam for the boys.

19:36.333 --> 19:37.333

Huh?

20:09.916 --> 20:13.250
Is it called Thanasis-ball?
You have a whole team! Huh?

20:13.333 --> 20:15.083

21:24.000 --> 21:25.375
You want plantain? Hmm?

21:34.000 --> 21:35.625
Foul! Foul!

21:44.375 --> 21:45.833
Hey!

21:47.000 --> 21:48.208
Do you hoop?

21:48.916 --> 21:50.458
-Hoop?
-Basketball.

21:50.541 --> 21:51.666
Sure, we'll play.

21:53.458 --> 21:55.083
-What about Papa?
-He can see us.

22:04.708 --> 22:05.875
Come on.

22:07.458 --> 22:09.375
-Stop, stop, stop.
-That's a travel.

22:09.458 --> 22:12.250
-You can't do that. That's traveling.
-It's what?

22:12.333 --> 22:15.583
Gianni, you got to keep bouncing it, bro.

22:15.666 --> 22:16.708
Keep bouncing it?

22:16.791 --> 22:17.791
Mm-hmm.

22:18.625 --> 22:19.625
Okay.

22:22.250 --> 22:23.250
Hey, hey, hey.

22:26.458 --> 22:27.541
The basket, man.

22:28.041 --> 22:29.958
-Go put the ball in the basket.
-Bro. Ugo.

22:30.041 --> 22:31.250
Put the ball in the basket.

22:31.333 --> 22:32.375
-Over here.
-Shoot!

22:46.000 --> 22:47.458
Hey, hey, hey! Pass it.

22:54.208 --> 22:55.208
Tag.

22:57.083 --> 22:58.583
Giannis. Thanasis.

22:59.583 --> 23:00.958
Oya, second half now.

23:01.041 --> 23:02.916
You should come down to the gym and play.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.916
Youth club. It's free.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Where?

23:06.083 --> 23:07.083
Filathlitikos.

23:07.833 --> 23:08.833
Okay.

23:27.916 --> 23:30.708
Welcome back to
the top ten African basketball players.

23:30.791 --> 23:34.208
And at number two from Cameroon
and now living and playing in Greece,

23:34.291 --> 23:37.875
Sofoklis Schortsanitis,
known as Baby Shaq.

23:37.958 --> 23:39.708
-Whoa.

23:42.750 --> 23:46.041
Man, he's like,
"Is somebody here the Hulk of basketball?"

23:48.416 --> 23:52.291
And at number one is
the first pick of the 1984 NBA Draft.

23:52.375 --> 23:54.833
Hakeem Olajuwon from Nigeria.

23:54.916 --> 23:58.791
He was a soccer player and didn't start
playing basketball till five years ago.

23:58.875 --> 24:00.458
Look at the footwork from Olajuwon.

24:00.541 --> 24:02.833
Fake, baseline and he scores.

24:02.916 --> 24:05.625
Hakeem the Dream, what a move!

24:05.708 --> 24:08.166
-Oya, boys. Time for bed.
-If he was the only player on the court,

24:08.250 --> 24:09.791
I could watch him play all night--

24:10.375 --> 24:14.208
Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
those who trespass against us.

24:14.291 --> 24:17.958
Lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

24:18.041 --> 24:19.041
Amen.

24:21.625 --> 24:23.250
And you.

24:23.750 --> 24:25.291
And you.

24:26.208 --> 24:27.750
And you.

24:27.833 --> 24:29.291
Oya, go to bed.

24:35.291 --> 24:36.791
-Good night.
-Good night, Ma.

24:36.875 --> 24:38.416
-Good night, Ma!
-Good night, Ma.

24:41.916 --> 24:43.083
I wanna play again.

24:43.166 --> 24:44.500
You couldn't even bounce the ball.

24:44.583 --> 24:46.458
-Ooh!

24:46.541 --> 24:47.625
And how would you know?

24:47.708 --> 24:50.666
Every time I looked over there, you were
stuffing your face with plantains.

24:50.750 --> 24:53.750
-Ooh, true.
-We could see you.

24:54.250 --> 24:56.166
The ball kept rolling through your legs.

24:56.250 --> 24:58.666
Well, you saw they didn't get the ball,
did they?

24:59.958 --> 25:01.875
-Yo.
-It's called defense.

25:05.458 --> 25:07.916
Filathlitikos
is one hour, 20 minutes away.

25:08.791 --> 25:11.791
We'll have to ride to get the bus,
then change to the Metro.

25:11.875 --> 25:14.291
I don't know. Papa won't like that.

25:14.375 --> 25:16.125
And who's going to tell him?

25:17.875 --> 25:19.791
-Why are you looking at me?

25:20.666 --> 25:24.541
Listen, go after school tomorrow.
Get home before he's back from work.

25:24.625 --> 25:27.291
Yeah, and we can get back home
before he even knows what happened.

25:27.375 --> 25:29.583
And I'll come
to make sure you get there safely.

25:29.666 --> 25:31.708
No, bro. Too little.

25:32.958 --> 25:33.958
I'm growing.

25:34.041 --> 25:37.208
Listen,
since this is a top-secret mission,

25:38.416 --> 25:40.708
me and Gianni have to scope it out first.

25:40.791 --> 25:43.208
If it's safe, maybe we'll take you.

25:43.291 --> 25:44.416
Maybe?

25:44.500 --> 25:45.791
I just grew.

25:45.875 --> 25:47.791
It'll change to "maybe not"
if you don't go to sleep now.

25:47.875 --> 25:49.375
-I grew more!
-Sleep.

25:50.541 --> 25:52.791
You too. Sleep.

26:00.833 --> 26:04.708
Listen,
Papa always talks about opportunity.

26:05.375 --> 26:06.583
What if this is it?

26:07.750 --> 26:09.208
The boy said it's a big club.

26:10.333 --> 26:13.375
If we're good,
maybe they pick us for their team.

26:13.958 --> 26:15.666
Basketball players can make money.

26:16.625 --> 26:18.208
We can help Mom and Dad.

26:18.708 --> 26:21.166
-You think you're that good already?

26:21.250 --> 26:23.958
If it's to help our family,
I will get that good.

27:03.875 --> 27:06.166
MUNICIPAL GYM OF ZOGRAFOS

27:35.833 --> 27:37.083
Gianni.

28:00.333 --> 28:02.416
No wonder we're in last place.

28:02.500 --> 28:05.625
We're terrible. Completely 100% terrible.

28:11.416 --> 28:12.625
Who are these guys?

28:13.125 --> 28:14.125
You know these guys?

28:15.541 --> 28:16.541
They're tall.

28:25.875 --> 28:28.000
What-- What are you guys doing here?

28:30.166 --> 28:35.166
Uh, we're-- we're here to play basketball.
At the, uh-- the-- the free youth camp.

28:35.791 --> 28:39.041
Yes, we need it to be really, really free.

28:42.208 --> 28:44.208
Do your parents know that you're here?

28:44.708 --> 28:47.083
Uh… Our mom dropped us off.

28:47.166 --> 28:50.291
She'll be back later.
She wanted us to do the-- the free--

28:50.375 --> 28:52.041
The free youth club. Yeah, I heard that.

28:52.125 --> 28:54.875
But we're gonna need her signature
before you can play.

28:54.958 --> 28:57.583
But she doesn't know we're here.

28:57.666 --> 28:59.833
Gianni. Man.

29:02.708 --> 29:04.958
-Where are you guys from?
-Sepolia.

29:08.791 --> 29:09.791
Wait here.

29:11.208 --> 29:13.000
Why did you have to tell him
we're from Sepolia?

29:13.083 --> 29:15.250
What did you want me to say? Ireland?

29:17.583 --> 29:20.708
All right, you can play for today, okay?

31:33.166 --> 31:34.375
Where did you get that?

31:35.166 --> 31:37.541
We went to play basketball after school.

31:37.625 --> 31:38.625
What basketball?

31:38.708 --> 31:41.000
Filathlitikos.
They have a youth camp there. We--

31:41.083 --> 31:43.791
You went across town
without asking me or your mother?

31:43.875 --> 31:45.125
-Papa…
-To play basketball?

31:45.208 --> 31:47.916
…Filathlitikos is one of
the best teams in Greece.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.250
The camp feeds the men's team.
It's free. No questions asked.

31:53.458 --> 31:55.958
Papa, the coach gave us this.

31:57.208 --> 32:00.625
They said if you sign this,
we can play every day after school.

32:04.375 --> 32:05.875
What if they had reported you?

32:07.208 --> 32:09.375
You disobeyed your father
and took your younger brother with you.

32:09.458 --> 32:11.291
-Papa, wait--
-We did it together, Papa.

32:11.375 --> 32:14.000
If we were in Nigeria,
you both would've been beyond grounded…

32:14.083 --> 32:15.833

-…for a week.

32:15.916 --> 32:17.250
Mama?

32:24.875 --> 32:26.708
My friend, leave that basketball.

32:35.791 --> 32:37.625
Let their punishment be a lesson, eh?

32:37.708 --> 32:39.750
Promise me never to disobey your parents.

32:39.833 --> 32:41.708
-We promise.
-Good.

32:50.166 --> 32:51.166
Can you imagine?

32:55.958 --> 32:57.458
These boys are gonna kill me.

33:04.166 --> 33:07.625
Why are you reacting so crazy?
It's just a couple of hours after school.

33:08.708 --> 33:11.000
When they are at school,
I know where they are, okay?

33:11.083 --> 33:12.541

33:12.625 --> 33:14.166
We sell, we sell together.

33:14.250 --> 33:16.583

this is only going to jeopardize that

33:16.666 --> 33:18.333
and distract them
from getting an education.

33:18.416 --> 33:21.250
Shebi, we always said we wanted to protect
their childhood.

33:21.333 --> 33:24.333

giving us papers to sign, eh?

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
Don't you remember
when you used to play football?

33:35.833 --> 33:37.833
We should let them play.

33:37.916 --> 33:39.625
They need to have fun
like normal children.

39:26.125 --> 39:27.625

39:28.208 --> 39:32.083

39:32.708 --> 39:34.708

39:34.791 --> 39:36.708

39:39.875 --> 39:40.875
National team?

39:40.958 --> 39:43.791
Yeah, why not?
Who knows where he'll end up?

39:44.666 --> 39:47.041
And Giannis, uh…

39:47.625 --> 39:48.625
He's getting better.

39:53.583 --> 39:55.333

39:55.416 --> 39:57.250

39:57.333 --> 39:58.333
Mmm.

39:58.416 --> 40:00.166

40:00.250 --> 40:02.250
and you hope the gods
are smiling down on you.

40:04.666 --> 40:06.041

40:07.250 --> 40:09.541

Way to go, Gianni!

40:38.125 --> 40:39.458
Feeling good today.

40:43.083 --> 40:44.500
Look at them. Lookit.

40:48.541 --> 40:51.083
Hey. Show them who we are.

40:51.166 --> 40:52.291
Who wants this more, eh?

41:08.500 --> 41:10.250
That's an advance for my signature.

41:10.958 --> 41:13.541
Panarios, another C-League basketball club
here in Athens,

41:13.625 --> 41:15.875
they saw Thanasis play, spoke to Takis.

41:15.958 --> 41:18.291
They want him to switch clubs
and play for their men's team.

41:18.375 --> 41:19.916
Is-- Is Takis okay with this?

41:20.000 --> 41:23.416
No, he wants me to stay.
But he says it's our choice.

41:23.500 --> 41:24.875
He knows we need the money.

41:25.750 --> 41:28.041
I told him I'm taking it for us.

41:30.041 --> 41:31.916
I'm so proud of you, Rotimi.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.208
Huh?

41:33.291 --> 41:37.208
Ugo, Ndubuisi, Emeka,
your brother is leading by example.

41:37.291 --> 41:41.250
When one person in the family scores,
the whole family scores.

41:42.166 --> 41:43.625
That's not how Papa says it.

41:44.125 --> 41:47.333
When one person in the family scores,
the whole family scores.

41:47.833 --> 41:49.083
That's not how I sound.

42:43.333 --> 42:44.958
No, no, no, that can't be right.

42:45.541 --> 42:47.916
Sir, this is an official check
from a basketball club.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.125
Please, try it again.

42:49.208 --> 42:51.333
I did, sir. It's no good.

42:59.666 --> 43:00.666
Yeah.

43:02.666 --> 43:03.666
Mm-hmm.

43:10.625 --> 43:11.625
Okay.

43:22.416 --> 43:23.666
What happened?

43:24.750 --> 43:28.500
Takis says the club found out
about our status and withdrew the offer.

43:30.833 --> 43:33.500
Rotimi, I'm sorry. I really am.

43:52.708 --> 43:54.875
Tell Mom and Dad I'll be out in a minute.

43:57.458 --> 43:58.458
I'm okay.

44:21.458 --> 44:22.666
They can knock us down.

44:24.916 --> 44:27.750
They can ignore us, insult us.

44:27.833 --> 44:31.625
They can tell us we shouldn't be here
and call us names.

44:33.500 --> 44:35.750
But they can't stop us
from getting back up.

45:10.250 --> 45:11.666
National news now.

45:11.750 --> 45:14.625
Entry into Greece
remains the preferred path

45:14.708 --> 45:20.458
for thousands of refugees escaping war,
trying to find safety in the EU.

45:20.958 --> 45:25.666
The Greek government is unable to curb
the flow of these illegal immigrants.

45:26.166 --> 45:29.041
It has led to a rise
in anti-immigrant protests,

45:29.125 --> 45:31.083
and violence directed towards them.

45:31.833 --> 45:34.833
The government is now convening
a special council to decide--

46:39.666 --> 46:41.583
I was going to do that.

46:43.708 --> 46:44.708
I can help you.

46:48.583 --> 46:49.583
It's okay.

47:02.291 --> 47:03.958
Why did you leave Francis behind?

47:15.708 --> 47:17.375
He was too young for the journey.

47:22.458 --> 47:26.708
It was one of the most difficult decisions
of my life.

47:29.958 --> 47:32.375
I'm still not sure
if we did the right thing.

47:36.000 --> 47:39.500
We wanted to go to Greece
in search of a better life,

47:40.083 --> 47:42.791
but we couldn't get
our Greek visa in Nigeria.

47:45.208 --> 47:47.000
So we had to find another way.

47:49.875 --> 47:51.708
But it took many years.

47:54.625 --> 47:56.375
By then, Francis had been born.

48:01.125 --> 48:03.625
Your father and I
spent many weeks discussing it.

48:05.333 --> 48:10.625
We couldn't take Francis because we'd
heard stories about the European police

48:11.750 --> 48:15.291
treating even legal African travelers
like they were criminals.

48:18.958 --> 48:20.958
The journey would've been too dangerous.

48:24.250 --> 48:25.583
So we made our choice…

48:28.000 --> 48:30.708
to leave him where it was safe.

48:34.458 --> 48:35.708
To bring him over…

48:38.083 --> 48:40.458
as soon as we were settled in Greece.

48:48.291 --> 48:49.750
We stick together.

48:54.458 --> 48:58.458
But sometimes we need to sacrifice
for the family.

49:00.750 --> 49:01.875
Don't cry, Mama.

49:04.708 --> 49:06.833
Everything will be okay one day.

49:06.916 --> 49:08.416
I promise.

49:14.041 --> 49:16.125
God makes no mistakes.

49:34.041 --> 49:36.375
Give it your all.

49:39.416 --> 49:41.375
And then let God do his work.

50:19.375 --> 50:20.958
Charles Adetokunbo with the ball.

50:21.458 --> 50:22.458
He fires.

50:22.541 --> 50:28.333
Oh! It's a goal! It's a goal!

50:29.500 --> 50:32.750
The mathematical Charles Adetokunbo
just scored again.

50:34.166 --> 50:35.583
Charles the man.

50:36.458 --> 50:38.125
-He did it.

50:38.208 --> 50:39.250
He did it!

51:10.750 --> 51:12.791
Thunder now to inbound. Up five.

51:13.666 --> 51:16.583
Trying to work the ball inside.
Nothing there.

51:17.875 --> 51:20.250
The dish off the down screen to Durant.

51:22.166 --> 51:24.375
And he hits it.

51:28.166 --> 51:29.791
I got this for you boys, huh?

51:30.500 --> 51:32.750
Since you wore out
the pair you were sharing.

51:36.166 --> 51:37.166
Thank you, Papa.

51:37.250 --> 51:38.458
Ah.

51:43.083 --> 51:44.083
You worked hard.

51:44.791 --> 51:45.791
Hmm.

51:46.708 --> 51:48.166
You've shown commitment.

51:50.333 --> 51:51.333
You earned it.

51:53.166 --> 51:54.500
-Let's go break them in.

51:54.583 --> 51:55.875
Let's go.

51:55.958 --> 51:57.541
Uh-uh. In this rain?

51:58.208 --> 51:59.208
Yes.

52:01.625 --> 52:03.625
Four, three, two--

52:04.916 --> 52:06.416
It's okay. We'll go again.

52:12.375 --> 52:13.375
Chin up, huh?

52:24.541 --> 52:26.791
That's why we fall.
We fall to get back up.

52:37.875 --> 52:40.875
It's okay. It's okay.
Shake it off, huh? Come back.

52:41.458 --> 52:43.958
It's not where you start.
It's where you finish.

52:46.583 --> 52:48.291
The company has put me on the payroll.

52:48.375 --> 52:50.083
They're sending me checks every week.

52:50.166 --> 52:52.666
And they're making
Social Security contributions.

52:52.750 --> 52:56.916
Which I can't claim until I'm legal,
but, uh…

53:00.125 --> 53:03.916
This qualifies for work permit, right?

53:04.000 --> 53:05.416
You're a janitor?

53:06.875 --> 53:08.166
Yes, I'm the janitor.

53:14.791 --> 53:17.625
This isn't something we can build
a residency application from.

53:19.708 --> 53:21.333
You said "payroll job."

53:21.416 --> 53:22.750
I meant a real job.

53:24.083 --> 53:26.250
Ms. Pantazis, this is a real job.

53:26.875 --> 53:28.750
Something that requires skill.

53:29.458 --> 53:30.791
I thought it'd be obvious.

53:31.458 --> 53:32.458
Skill?

53:34.541 --> 53:39.583
I'm sorry, Ms. Pantazis.
What exactly is it you do here?

53:41.083 --> 53:42.375
You sit there and-- and you--

53:42.458 --> 53:45.000
y-you give us advice,
and nothing ever gets done.

53:53.166 --> 53:58.291
The government is never going
to give us residency, are they?

53:58.375 --> 54:00.291
They are more concerned
with keeping people out.

54:05.791 --> 54:06.875
Keeping people out.

54:10.458 --> 54:15.000
Ms. Pantazis, did you know that the Greek
civilization has its roots in Africa?

54:16.083 --> 54:17.083
Oh, yes.

54:17.166 --> 54:21.333
Zeus and Shango,
the Yoruba God of lightning and thunder…

54:23.166 --> 54:24.166
they are the same.

54:24.791 --> 54:28.458
We can't mess this up or you'll end up
on the government's radar and deported.

55:10.333 --> 55:13.625
Giannis, you're starting today.
I need you to step up.

55:37.625 --> 55:39.166
Pass, pass, pass!

55:39.833 --> 55:41.458
Hey, move! Easy.

55:42.375 --> 55:43.666
Come on, man.

55:47.625 --> 55:49.000
Pressure. Pressure.

55:49.500 --> 55:51.208
Hands, Gianni! Hands!

55:52.000 --> 55:53.166
Hands!

55:54.708 --> 55:56.333
Man, man.

56:03.541 --> 56:04.583
Gianni.

56:08.041 --> 56:09.541
Give it up, blackie. You suck.

56:30.291 --> 56:31.291
Chairman.

56:44.458 --> 56:45.458
-Papa.
-Hmm?

56:49.458 --> 56:50.875
Why do they hate us so much?

56:59.958 --> 57:01.333
Ugo, racists are ignorant.

57:04.291 --> 57:06.375
Afraid of anything and anybody different.

57:09.333 --> 57:11.916
Son,
this country has given us free education.

57:12.625 --> 57:13.625
Hmm?

57:13.708 --> 57:15.250
Jobs. Freedom.

57:16.875 --> 57:18.625
The rest we'll sort out for ourselves.

57:20.791 --> 57:21.791
-Okay?

57:26.250 --> 57:28.291
Did he make a miraculous shot? Yes.

57:28.375 --> 57:30.750
Has he ever done it before?
You bet he has.

57:30.833 --> 57:33.625
Will he ever do it again?
Time and time again.

58:35.916 --> 58:38.750
-Now, we'll get the rest to you next week.
-No.

58:38.833 --> 58:42.083


58:43.750 --> 58:45.208
Shebi work has been slow.

58:45.708 --> 58:49.041
Or you been spending all your money
on your boys' basketball.

58:50.208 --> 58:54.208
I get plenty people who will want take
this place from you, and they pay on time.

59:10.708 --> 59:14.875
Is that you?
Huh? Huh?

59:20.750 --> 59:22.000
Okay. I know that face.

59:22.875 --> 59:23.875
Don't say one word.

59:26.750 --> 59:28.291
-I can explain.

59:28.375 --> 59:31.000
Okay. Stavros's cousin owns a garage.

59:31.083 --> 59:33.000
Okay, it just need a new battery.

59:33.083 --> 59:35.791
Brake pads, oil change, carburetor. Hmm?

59:37.375 --> 59:39.041
-I fixed it.

59:40.041 --> 59:43.708
We can't afford to buy a new car.
We need to pay this month's rent.

59:44.791 --> 59:47.541
Vera, listen to me.
We only have 500 euros.

59:47.625 --> 59:48.500
Uh-huh.

59:48.583 --> 59:51.541
But with a car,
we can go out of town, huh?

59:52.375 --> 59:53.458
Sell to tourists.

59:54.625 --> 59:57.083
We'll be the only ones there, huh?

1:00:01.291 --> 1:00:02.958
Why don't you take me for a ride?

1:00:20.458 --> 1:00:21.458
Yeah.

1:00:31.833 --> 1:00:33.791
Well, at least he can hit a jumper now.

1:00:35.416 --> 1:00:36.416
All right.

1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:38.583
We're gonna be good this year.

1:00:42.833 --> 1:00:43.875
Good.

1:00:48.333 --> 1:00:49.416
Thano!

1:00:51.625 --> 1:00:53.458
-All right! Go.

1:00:55.791 --> 1:00:56.875
Watch out! Good!

1:00:58.000 --> 1:00:59.416
Thano, bud, go!

1:01:05.125 --> 1:01:06.916
Thano, keep your feet light.

1:01:10.291 --> 1:01:12.791
All right! That's why we're working
all week, man.

1:01:12.875 --> 1:01:13.875
That's why we working.

1:01:14.916 --> 1:01:16.791
Thanasis is a star.

1:01:17.375 --> 1:01:21.541
Yeah. Good, good, good, good.
Go. Go, go, go. Nice.

1:01:21.625 --> 1:01:25.333
Hands! Hands! Hands!
Thano. Pressure. Giannis, pressure!

1:01:26.666 --> 1:01:28.541
-Hands!

1:01:28.625 --> 1:01:29.916
Block it!

1:01:31.541 --> 1:01:33.166
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

1:01:34.916 --> 1:01:36.083
And look at Giannis.

1:01:42.250 --> 1:01:44.375
-Yes!
-Yeah!

1:01:44.458 --> 1:01:45.458
Go!

1:01:46.458 --> 1:01:47.458
Yes!

1:01:48.666 --> 1:01:50.041
He has potential.

1:01:51.083 --> 1:01:52.583
Pressure, Giannis, pressure!

1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:55.333
Go, go, go, go.

1:02:07.791 --> 1:02:09.625
He's leading the whole team.

1:02:09.708 --> 1:02:11.916
Go, go. Come on. Two.

1:02:17.875 --> 1:02:20.708
You guys were hitting the ball,
now this happens. Okay?

1:02:20.791 --> 1:02:22.666
Watch a little bit what's going on!

1:02:22.750 --> 1:02:25.958
-Calm down.
-Calm down? You calm down!

1:02:26.041 --> 1:02:27.875
It's okay. It's okay.

1:02:32.833 --> 1:02:34.250
Are you okay? Are you--

1:02:34.333 --> 1:02:35.458
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

1:02:35.541 --> 1:02:36.541
It's okay.

1:02:38.375 --> 1:02:39.958
-Easy.

1:02:54.666 --> 1:02:56.666
Gianni. Go.

1:02:58.083 --> 1:02:59.291
This is your chance.

1:03:01.333 --> 1:03:02.333
Lead the team.

They are as good as anyone, Paco.

1:04:27.791 --> 1:04:29.875
And still, they have room to grow.

1:04:30.666 --> 1:04:32.791
No GM's gonna take it seriously.

1:04:32.875 --> 1:04:35.583
These guys are never gonna be able
to play legally in the A-League.

1:04:35.666 --> 1:04:38.083
-They don't have papers.
-You can get them papers.

1:04:39.125 --> 1:04:42.208
Look. I said I'd come as a favor
to Mr. Gianakos, and I did. Okay?

1:04:42.708 --> 1:04:44.416
They're illegal immigrants, Haris.

1:04:45.458 --> 1:04:49.000
Teams will get fined for signing them,
and they'll get sent back

1:04:49.083 --> 1:04:51.875
to wherever they came from
the moment it's public.

1:04:51.958 --> 1:04:53.083
They were born here.

1:04:55.166 --> 1:04:56.458
You don't say.

1:05:01.291 --> 1:05:03.541
Hi. I'm Haris Eleftheriou.

1:05:03.625 --> 1:05:08.291
That's Haris with one R.

1:05:08.916 --> 1:05:12.416
And Eleftheriou also one R.

1:05:14.208 --> 1:05:17.375
We scout players from the lower leagues
to the A-League.

1:05:18.375 --> 1:05:22.750
Very few are good enough,
but Giannis was incredible today.

1:05:22.833 --> 1:05:24.541
He has really turned the team around.

1:05:25.041 --> 1:05:27.083
Your friend didn't seem to think so.

1:05:27.166 --> 1:05:28.958
-Paco?
-Mmm.

1:05:29.041 --> 1:05:30.333
He's not my friend.

1:05:30.416 --> 1:05:34.041
H-He is one of the most powerful
general scouts in the league.

1:05:34.125 --> 1:05:38.416
He can influence anybody and get
any A-League team to pick up a player.

1:05:39.083 --> 1:05:40.291
But he is not my friend.

1:05:41.250 --> 1:05:46.041
If you think he's good,
why don't you call the teams yourself?

1:05:47.041 --> 1:05:49.166
I'd have to rep them first.

1:05:50.250 --> 1:05:51.583
Excuse us, Haris.

1:05:56.875 --> 1:05:58.166
Boys!

1:05:58.875 --> 1:06:00.375
Oya. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1:06:07.791 --> 1:06:08.875
Sports agent.

1:06:15.500 --> 1:06:16.500
Hmm?

1:06:22.833 --> 1:06:25.250
So, you want to be my agent?

1:06:26.625 --> 1:06:27.625
If you'd have me.

1:06:31.541 --> 1:06:32.541
Cool.

1:06:35.583 --> 1:06:36.583
Thank you.

1:06:37.208 --> 1:06:39.208
You won't regret this. I promise you.

1:06:39.291 --> 1:06:41.125
I-I will break my back for you.

1:06:41.625 --> 1:06:43.541
I'm going to start making calls
right away.

1:06:44.666 --> 1:06:47.791
Hey, um, h-how many clients do you have?

1:06:48.375 --> 1:06:49.375
You're the first.

1:07:22.125 --> 1:07:23.208
Those are selling out.

1:07:23.291 --> 1:07:24.750
-Oh, yes.

1:07:55.375 --> 1:07:56.958
-How far?
-It's not working.

1:07:57.041 --> 1:07:58.041
Eh?

1:07:59.333 --> 1:08:00.333
Let me see.

1:09:06.541 --> 1:09:07.958
You could have called us.

1:09:08.041 --> 1:09:11.625
Uh-uh.

1:09:11.708 --> 1:09:14.000
-We live here.
-Oh, yeah? Pay the rent.

1:09:16.791 --> 1:09:21.208
This is back rent,
this month's rent and next month's rent.

1:09:24.166 --> 1:09:27.875
Bamidele, look at those boys.
They should be in bed.

1:09:28.625 --> 1:09:29.750
You pull this again…

1:09:32.041 --> 1:09:33.291
I will not be as civil.

1:09:33.375 --> 1:09:36.166
Next time, I will call the police.

1:09:36.875 --> 1:09:38.958
They'll handle you. All of you.

1:09:40.625 --> 1:09:41.625
My key.

1:09:49.375 --> 1:09:50.500
All the teams said no?

1:09:51.125 --> 1:09:52.375
Paco was right.

1:09:52.458 --> 1:09:54.875
Nobody wants to take the risk
on undocumented players.

1:09:56.208 --> 1:09:59.416
But there is a regional tryout
we can sign them up for.

1:09:59.500 --> 1:10:03.125
There will be major teams there
and scouts from European teams.

1:10:03.208 --> 1:10:05.666
I can't try out like this.

1:10:09.625 --> 1:10:11.000
But Gianni can do it.

1:10:11.833 --> 1:10:14.541
European teams means international stage.

1:10:16.208 --> 1:10:17.833
Everybody will see you.

1:10:22.041 --> 1:10:23.375
I guess this is it.

1:10:25.291 --> 1:10:29.833
But if we want the prize,
we're going to have to take the risk.

1:10:31.750 --> 1:10:32.791
Are you sure?

1:10:35.916 --> 1:10:37.583
You know I had a dream once too?

1:10:41.791 --> 1:10:43.416
But it wasn't meant to be.

1:10:49.333 --> 1:10:51.000
I'm going to do everything I can

1:10:51.791 --> 1:10:54.125
to make sure you have a fair chance
at your dream.

1:11:18.083 --> 1:11:19.083
Okay.

We're on the last play!

1:13:19.833 --> 1:13:20.833
I can't watch.

1:13:22.208 --> 1:13:23.916
I'm going to wait outside.

1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:25.125
Come and get me after.

1:13:46.875 --> 1:13:48.208
Come on, Gianni.

1:13:48.791 --> 1:13:50.083
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

1:13:51.791 --> 1:13:53.041
No.

1:13:59.625 --> 1:14:01.666
Shoot it now. Shoot it.

1:14:21.791 --> 1:14:22.791
Papa!

1:14:28.458 --> 1:14:30.083
What happened? Is he okay?

1:14:30.166 --> 1:14:31.875
He did it, Papa.

1:14:31.958 --> 1:14:33.291
He dominated.

1:14:33.375 --> 1:14:34.875
He was amazing.

1:15:06.666 --> 1:15:09.958
We have one offer,
but it's a little complicated.

1:15:10.041 --> 1:15:12.375
It's always complicated.

1:15:13.250 --> 1:15:15.208
Basket Zaragoza wants to sign him.

1:15:15.833 --> 1:15:17.666
Zaragoza? In Spain?

1:15:18.166 --> 1:15:21.083
The Greek clubs are still a bit
worried about his lack of papers.

1:15:21.166 --> 1:15:23.750
The Spanish,
they are more business-minded.

1:15:24.333 --> 1:15:26.333
They are willing to take the risk.

1:15:26.833 --> 1:15:29.541
Haris, how on earth
are we supposed to move to Spain?

1:15:29.625 --> 1:15:31.208
We're not even supposed to be in Greece.

1:15:31.291 --> 1:15:35.000
They'll secure a Spanish visa for Giannis,
so he can relocate to Spain.

1:15:35.083 --> 1:15:39.625
Also, they'll make a 10% advance
on a contract so you can have some money.

1:15:40.250 --> 1:15:43.375
What about my family?
Will they get visas too?

1:15:46.583 --> 1:15:48.833
Uh, I can try to negotiate it.

1:15:49.333 --> 1:15:51.166
We have to all be together.

1:15:52.458 --> 1:15:54.166
I will not leave my family behind.

1:15:58.375 --> 1:15:59.375
Okay.

1:16:11.583 --> 1:16:13.416
How long should it take him
to convince them?

1:16:13.500 --> 1:16:15.375
It will happen when it happens.

1:16:17.375 --> 1:16:18.375
Ugo.

1:16:30.208 --> 1:16:31.208
Mr. Adetokunbo.

1:16:33.375 --> 1:16:34.375
How can I help you?

1:16:36.916 --> 1:16:39.458
It's 5,000 euros just for you.

1:16:40.291 --> 1:16:41.500
No questions asked.

1:16:43.166 --> 1:16:44.916
I can also get you Greek passports.

1:16:47.125 --> 1:16:50.000
All I need is for Giannis
to come with us to the office,

1:16:50.083 --> 1:16:53.791
talk to a couple of major Greek teams
I got lined up just for him

1:16:53.875 --> 1:16:55.708
and forget about Spain.

1:16:56.750 --> 1:16:58.791
What about Haris? Our agent?

1:17:01.041 --> 1:17:02.416
We don't trust him.

1:17:03.291 --> 1:17:04.541
Neither should you.

1:17:06.500 --> 1:17:09.958
Look, Zaragoza has already made
their final offer.

1:17:11.375 --> 1:17:13.083
They're not taking your family.

1:17:13.166 --> 1:17:14.416
Haris is on the way,

1:17:14.500 --> 1:17:17.583
and he's gonna bring you that deal
and try to get you to take it.

1:17:17.666 --> 1:17:18.875
How do you know that?

1:17:19.791 --> 1:17:24.750
Because I'm the number one scout in
this country, and I have eyes everywhere.

1:17:26.458 --> 1:17:28.041
I made a mistake with you,

1:17:28.875 --> 1:17:30.041
and I'm here to fix that.

1:17:30.958 --> 1:17:32.291
You're good.

1:17:32.375 --> 1:17:36.875
Giannis, you're very good,
but Zaragoza will not make you great.

1:17:37.875 --> 1:17:39.291
I will.

1:17:42.041 --> 1:17:45.041
This will guarantee your residency.

1:17:57.666 --> 1:17:59.750
Playing in Greece keeps
the family together.

1:17:59.833 --> 1:18:00.875
It makes sense.

1:18:01.541 --> 1:18:03.000
Haris has to be part of the deal.

1:18:03.083 --> 1:18:05.000
You heard him. They aren't gonna
make a deal with Haris.

1:18:05.083 --> 1:18:06.541
But we don't even know this guy.

1:18:07.416 --> 1:18:08.416
Mama.

1:18:08.500 --> 1:18:09.791
He's right.

1:18:09.875 --> 1:18:11.500
I don't trust him either.

1:18:12.875 --> 1:18:15.791
We can't just abandon people
who've worked so hard for us.

1:18:48.416 --> 1:18:49.666
Thank you for your offer.

1:18:58.625 --> 1:18:59.958
You should reconsider.

1:19:01.375 --> 1:19:04.416
I can make sure no one signs them. Ever.

1:19:05.083 --> 1:19:07.041
You think you can give us 5,000 euros,

1:19:07.708 --> 1:19:10.666
and we will sign any piece of toilet paper
you give us?

1:19:21.958 --> 1:19:24.666
You know,
we can get you all sent back home.

1:19:24.750 --> 1:19:26.291
This is our home.

1:19:51.416 --> 1:19:53.916
Let's go inside. It's cold.

1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:56.333
That was a lot of money.

1:20:12.125 --> 1:20:14.000
Guys! Guys!

1:20:14.833 --> 1:20:17.333
-Haris?
-Guys, I did it.

1:20:19.375 --> 1:20:21.833
I did it. This is big.

1:20:22.791 --> 1:20:23.791
We're going to Spain.

1:20:23.875 --> 1:20:25.958
Yeah! I mean, no. No.

1:20:26.041 --> 1:20:27.750
They-- They won't take the family.

1:20:31.625 --> 1:20:33.833
You are going to the NBA Draft.

1:20:42.583 --> 1:20:45.375
The NBA.

1:20:45.458 --> 1:20:48.000
If you are risking it all,
why not risk big?

1:20:48.083 --> 1:20:51.041
I called a US agent I met last year,
showed him the reel.

1:20:51.125 --> 1:20:53.958
He thinks Giannis is good enough
to be considered by the NBA teams.

1:20:54.041 --> 1:20:57.958
So I put an NBA buyout clause
into the Zaragoza contract,

1:20:58.041 --> 1:20:59.666
and Zaragoza agreed.

1:20:59.750 --> 1:21:01.625
The moment Giannis signs the Spanish deal,

1:21:01.708 --> 1:21:05.291
he becomes eligible for the NBA Draft
in New York City.

1:21:06.500 --> 1:21:07.500
I don't understand.

1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:12.791
If an NBA team wants Giannis,
they can draft him for a fee.

1:21:12.875 --> 1:21:15.208
-And he never has to go to Spain.
-Wait. Wait.

1:21:15.291 --> 1:21:17.791
But to go to America, he needs a US Visa.

1:21:18.958 --> 1:21:20.958
I mean, the Greek authorities
will know his status.

1:21:21.041 --> 1:21:22.708
How exactly is this better
than going to Spain?

1:21:22.791 --> 1:21:27.208
An NBA team will reunite the family
in America.

1:21:28.958 --> 1:21:31.291
Why didn't we go right to the NBA before?

1:21:32.500 --> 1:21:35.625
There are only two routes
to the NBA Draft.

1:21:35.708 --> 1:21:37.708
Play for an American college

1:21:37.791 --> 1:21:41.375
or sign a contract
with an international pro team.

1:21:41.958 --> 1:21:45.291
The Zaragoza contract means
Giannis is eligible now.

1:21:46.166 --> 1:21:47.833
What if he doesn't get picked?

1:21:47.916 --> 1:21:49.125
We will be exposed.

1:21:51.125 --> 1:21:53.000
And Giannis will be without us in Spain.

1:21:54.708 --> 1:21:56.583
But what if I do get picked?

1:22:04.083 --> 1:22:05.583
How did you get into the country?

1:22:06.750 --> 1:22:09.208
Um, w-we were born here.

1:22:10.541 --> 1:22:11.958
We both were.

1:22:16.250 --> 1:22:19.166
We've been up and down
this building for weeks.

1:22:19.750 --> 1:22:22.666
Forms, duplicates, countersignatures.

1:22:23.166 --> 1:22:25.458
-Now, someone said to me that--
-Is that--

1:22:27.083 --> 1:22:28.208
Is that your son?

1:22:32.125 --> 1:22:33.916
He looks like he can really play ball.

1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:35.750
He's captain in his high school team.

1:22:35.833 --> 1:22:37.416
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

1:22:37.500 --> 1:22:38.833
What position does he play?

1:22:42.416 --> 1:22:43.416
Forward.

1:22:43.500 --> 1:22:46.000
-Forward? I'm a forward.
-Mm-hmm.

1:22:46.708 --> 1:22:49.750
Small forward,
but I can play point guard too.

1:22:51.083 --> 1:22:54.333
You know, only the best players
are chosen to play forward.

1:22:54.416 --> 1:22:56.875
Yes. You really have to show up.

1:22:57.625 --> 1:23:03.791
The way he's positioned, holds the ball,
he looks like he really works hard.

1:23:04.708 --> 1:23:08.000
-What do you think, Thano?
-He looks like the real deal, man.

1:23:11.166 --> 1:23:13.250
You can tell all that from a photo?

1:23:14.583 --> 1:23:16.708
All we do is play basketball.

1:23:18.291 --> 1:23:19.916
That's all we do.

1:23:20.750 --> 1:23:24.791
You must know how difficult it is
for us to get to this place.

1:23:25.750 --> 1:23:29.833
All we need is a temporary visa,
so we can return home to our family.

1:23:29.916 --> 1:23:32.875
Only one of you has been selected
for the draft.

1:23:32.958 --> 1:23:35.916
My mom says he can't go without me.

1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:38.291
He's young. He needs a chaperone.

1:23:53.083 --> 1:23:55.916
Why don't you stop marveling at that
and help me pack?

1:23:56.708 --> 1:23:59.291
They spelt my name the Greek way.
Is that okay?

1:23:59.375 --> 1:24:00.375
Don't worry.

1:24:00.875 --> 1:24:04.416
We will always know our own name, huh?
No matter how you spell it.

1:24:06.708 --> 1:24:08.000
They will know our name.

1:24:17.541 --> 1:24:19.708
Haris, look after my boys, huh?

1:24:20.291 --> 1:24:21.166
I will.

1:24:26.833 --> 1:24:28.375
You are your brother's keeper.

1:24:33.083 --> 1:24:35.375
I'll pray for you. Good luck.

1:24:38.083 --> 1:24:39.541
-Bye, Ma.
-I love you.

1:24:42.833 --> 1:24:45.791
Come here. I love you.

1:24:56.708 --> 1:24:58.166
You're gonna come back, right?

1:24:58.875 --> 1:24:59.875
Yes.

1:25:01.708 --> 1:25:03.041
I'll bring us together.

1:25:04.833 --> 1:25:06.208
Francis too.

1:25:09.375 --> 1:25:10.208
Come on.

1:25:32.458 --> 1:25:33.500
Haris!

It'll bankrupt you. Use the Wi-Fi.

1:26:56.791 --> 1:27:00.166
If you get hungry, just call room service.
They'll bring you whatever you want.

1:27:00.250 --> 1:27:02.541
I'm in the room across the hall.
Knock if you need anything.

1:27:02.625 --> 1:27:04.000
We've got a busy day tomorrow.

1:27:04.083 --> 1:27:07.500
We'll go through our plans,
and then we have a dinner with Nike.

1:27:08.958 --> 1:27:10.416
-Nike?
-Yeah.

1:27:11.666 --> 1:27:14.666
Like shoes-on-my-feet Nike?

1:27:14.750 --> 1:27:19.125
Yeah. We're discussing them
paying you to wear their stuff.

1:27:19.208 --> 1:27:20.666
-What?
-Yeah.

1:27:20.750 --> 1:27:21.750
Get some rest, boys.

1:27:29.041 --> 1:27:31.791
So, what you going to do first?

1:27:31.875 --> 1:27:35.375
Think I'm going to take
the longest shower…

A big night. A lot of angst, Jay.

1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:57.791
A lot of anticipation
for the 14 lottery teams,

1:27:57.875 --> 1:27:59.583
and the big question, of course,

1:27:59.666 --> 1:28:01.416
is who is gonna end up
with the number one pick?

1:28:01.500 --> 1:28:04.708
I've got Ben McLemore
as the number one overall prospect.

1:28:04.791 --> 1:28:06.083
Nerlens Noel of Kentucky.

1:28:06.166 --> 1:28:09.958
Another guy who could very well be
the top pick, if not the top prospect.

1:28:10.041 --> 1:28:13.583
What about Oklahoma? Twelfth?
They said they love his tape.

1:28:13.666 --> 1:28:16.083
Yeah, but they said that they also wanna
send him back to Europe

1:28:16.166 --> 1:28:17.541
for a few years to develop.

1:28:18.416 --> 1:28:22.083
Now, we could go top ten
if we went that route.

1:28:22.166 --> 1:28:24.333
No, they have to keep him in the US

1:28:24.416 --> 1:28:26.083
-and bring the family over.
-Okay.

1:28:26.166 --> 1:28:28.666
Mystery man in the draft.
Giannis Antetokounmpo.

1:28:28.750 --> 1:28:31.500
-Bro, that's you.
-That would be great alphabet soup.

1:28:31.583 --> 1:28:33.250
But what he is, is 18 years old--

1:28:33.333 --> 1:28:36.708
Can you put him in an NBA game now?
Probably not.

1:28:36.791 --> 1:28:40.916
And if he drops below 17, the likelihood
of him getting picked is slim.

1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:43.541
He's most likely going back to Europe.
That's how I see it.

1:28:43.625 --> 1:28:45.291
So out of the 30 teams,

1:28:45.375 --> 1:28:49.916
our best shot is anywhere between the 11th
and the 16th pick.

1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:52.166
That's Philadelphia at 11. Boston, 16.

1:28:52.250 --> 1:28:54.333
Oklahoma, Dallas, Utah, Milwaukee
between them.

1:28:54.416 --> 1:28:57.166
-So any team above 11 and below 16--
-They're saying I'm not good.

1:28:59.416 --> 1:29:02.125
Giannis, don't believe everything you see
on TV, okay?

1:29:02.208 --> 1:29:03.291
What about this?

1:29:04.166 --> 1:29:06.125
They're saying
I'm not even getting picked.

1:29:07.375 --> 1:29:10.958
Listen, this is the NBA Draft.
Anything can happen.

1:29:11.041 --> 1:29:13.916
Tomorrow, we work the floor.
We meet the teams.

1:29:17.458 --> 1:29:19.708
How soon can I get money for my family?

1:29:19.791 --> 1:29:22.125
If Nike take him,
they can make an advance.

1:29:22.208 --> 1:29:25.166
Yes. They will get the money
to your family immediately.

1:29:25.250 --> 1:29:26.666
-All right?

1:29:26.750 --> 1:29:29.125
So it's important
that you sell yourself to them tonight.

1:29:37.708 --> 1:29:39.875
How am I supposed to sell myself tonight?

1:29:41.083 --> 1:29:44.625
The other players on TV, they're famous,
from big college programs.

1:29:45.541 --> 1:29:47.041
That's what Nike's looking for.

1:29:49.333 --> 1:29:50.416
What do I tell them?

1:30:07.208 --> 1:30:09.333
If Nike was to sign you,

1:30:09.416 --> 1:30:11.541
what do you think you would bring
to our brand, Giannis?

1:30:11.625 --> 1:30:12.750
Other than your game,

1:30:12.833 --> 1:30:15.625
what sets you apart
from every other player tomorrow night?

1:30:22.041 --> 1:30:23.416
Tell them who you are.

1:30:43.750 --> 1:30:45.916
I used to borrow my brother's sneakers…

1:30:47.916 --> 1:30:49.500
because we couldn't afford a second pair.

1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:54.708
I would sleep on a mattress in the gym

1:30:56.208 --> 1:31:00.833
so I could wake up and begin training
without losing any time.

1:31:08.833 --> 1:31:14.083
We've seen our parents forced
to leave a child behind in one country

1:31:14.166 --> 1:31:16.416
to build a future
for our family in another,

1:31:17.875 --> 1:31:20.291
not knowing
if they would ever see him again.

1:31:23.458 --> 1:31:27.416
We have hidden from the police
our entire lives because we were illegal.

1:31:28.791 --> 1:31:32.500
Always from the outside looking in,
in the country where we were born.

1:31:35.083 --> 1:31:36.125
We work harder.

1:31:38.375 --> 1:31:39.375
We run farther.

1:31:40.458 --> 1:31:45.375
And we are hungrier
because we know the meaning of sacrifice.

1:31:49.250 --> 1:31:51.583
God has been watching over us.

1:31:52.875 --> 1:31:54.875
And God will reunite our family again.

1:31:56.166 --> 1:31:57.750
I just have to play my part.

1:32:05.958 --> 1:32:06.958
So…

1:32:09.250 --> 1:32:10.250
…did you like him?

1:32:11.583 --> 1:32:14.166
We'll talk after the draft.
Good night, Haris.

1:32:20.958 --> 1:32:23.750


1:32:26.583 --> 1:32:29.250
-That Euro step was something else.

1:32:29.333 --> 1:32:31.083
You've got a lot of potential.

1:32:31.166 --> 1:32:33.375
You, my friend,
are gonna have a heck of a career.

1:32:34.500 --> 1:32:36.916
The 76ers don't need a small forward.

1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:38.375
Well, he's also a guard.

1:32:38.458 --> 1:32:40.708
He'll need work
to get himself strong enough for that.

1:32:40.791 --> 1:32:42.958
I need someone I can throw in immediately.

1:32:43.041 --> 1:32:44.458
You're not giving us access?

1:32:44.541 --> 1:32:47.458
Guarantee you won't send him back
to Europe, and you'll meet him.

1:32:47.541 --> 1:32:49.833
He's not ready for this league,
and he's got no papers.

1:32:49.916 --> 1:32:52.166
-Utah doesn't think that.
-Utah's yanking your chain.

1:32:52.250 --> 1:32:53.833
They don't want him. We do.

1:32:53.916 --> 1:32:55.000
How about I pick him at 12?

1:32:55.083 --> 1:32:57.000
And there's nothing you
or Utah can do about it.

1:32:58.333 --> 1:33:01.958
Could you take me through
what you're doing here in the transition?

1:33:02.041 --> 1:33:05.916
So, we're supposed to turn
defense into offense in eight seconds.

1:33:06.000 --> 1:33:09.375
But if I turn and power out,
I can do it in five.

1:33:09.458 --> 1:33:12.208
Our forward would've been intercepted here
by their guards,

1:33:12.291 --> 1:33:13.875
so I went with our center.

1:33:13.958 --> 1:33:16.041
Faked a pass and switched up the rhythm.

1:33:16.708 --> 1:33:17.708
Uh…

1:33:19.333 --> 1:33:21.416
You know anything about Milwaukee,
Giannis?

1:33:21.500 --> 1:33:24.208
No, sir, but I would love to learn.

1:33:25.416 --> 1:33:29.083
Great. Good. Let's go.
Well, thank you so much.

1:33:29.166 --> 1:33:30.500
-Thank you.
-Best of luck.

1:33:30.583 --> 1:33:31.666
You too.

1:33:31.750 --> 1:33:32.750
Thanks, gentlemen.

1:33:35.666 --> 1:33:37.500
John. John. John, listen.

1:33:38.291 --> 1:33:40.500
So what do you think?
We have a shot at 15th?

1:33:40.583 --> 1:33:43.833
Yeah, he's a brilliant mind.
The best I've seen in a long time.

1:33:43.916 --> 1:33:46.458
But he is far from finished, okay?

1:33:46.541 --> 1:33:49.000
Um, it could be all season
before he makes the team.

1:33:49.083 --> 1:33:52.875
And his undocumented status,
that's a concern, to say the least.

1:33:52.958 --> 1:33:55.541
I'm not gonna lie to you guys. It's risky.

1:33:57.041 --> 1:33:58.541
Have a good day, gentlemen.

1:34:04.333 --> 1:34:07.083
Milwaukee would have kept him
in America, right?

1:34:07.583 --> 1:34:08.625
Yeah.

1:34:13.375 --> 1:34:14.458
What are you doing?

1:34:14.541 --> 1:34:18.083
I'm gonna call Utah and Atlanta,
see where they are.

1:34:18.166 --> 1:34:20.625
This isn't just some kid
getting drafted, Kevin.

1:34:21.333 --> 1:34:22.375
I know.

1:34:22.458 --> 1:34:24.583
He might never see his family again.

1:34:39.958 --> 1:34:43.416
Is there a chance
I might not get picked at all?

1:34:43.916 --> 1:34:47.416
Hey, people come here all the time
and don't get picked.

1:34:47.500 --> 1:34:50.458
Dwight Buycks. Diante Garrett.
JaMychal Green.

1:34:51.041 --> 1:34:52.708
They all made it to the NBA.

1:34:54.083 --> 1:34:56.416
It's not where you start.
It's where you finish.

1:35:02.333 --> 1:35:03.541
Excuse me. Sorry, sir.

1:35:03.625 --> 1:35:05.000
Excuse me, please. Thank you.

1:35:05.958 --> 1:35:09.000
The 2013 NBA Draft preview.

1:35:10.208 --> 1:35:12.541
-Kostas, always running, running, huh?
-Now it's time.

1:35:12.625 --> 1:35:14.833
Fifteen minutes
until the Cavaliers go on the clock…

1:35:14.916 --> 1:35:17.250
-You won't see anything like that.
-…and start the NBA Draft 2013.

1:35:17.333 --> 1:35:18.333
Okay, I'll watch.

1:35:18.416 --> 1:35:20.083
Orlando and Washington
sitting just behind.

1:35:20.166 --> 1:35:24.166
He has all the power
of his mother's prayers with him.

1:35:25.291 --> 1:35:28.500
He's his father's son.
He doesn't know when to quit.

1:35:28.583 --> 1:35:29.583
Mm-hmm.

1:35:33.041 --> 1:35:38.041
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the 2013 NBA Draft.

1:35:38.125 --> 1:35:40.083
Please take your seats.

1:35:46.416 --> 1:35:48.083
Noel is gonna go first?

1:35:48.166 --> 1:35:49.791
He's definitely going first.

1:35:49.875 --> 1:35:52.083
No. No, he's too skinny.
No offensive game.

1:35:53.083 --> 1:35:56.625
Gianni, thank you for having my back.

1:35:57.458 --> 1:35:58.958
Family always sticks together.

1:36:02.041 --> 1:36:04.083
It's starting! It's starting!
It's starting!

1:36:12.875 --> 1:36:15.333
Here to do the honors for 2013,

1:36:15.416 --> 1:36:18.291
the commissioner of the NBA,
Mr. David Stern.

1:36:18.375 --> 1:36:23.541
Good evening, and thank you
for that enthusiastic Brooklyn welcome.

1:36:24.791 --> 1:36:29.541
Tonight is the culmination
of years of dedication and hard work

1:36:29.625 --> 1:36:31.958
for the best young players in the world,

1:36:32.041 --> 1:36:35.000
as well as the family and friends
who support them.

1:36:35.833 --> 1:36:39.375
And I know the young men hoping to hear
their names called tonight

1:36:39.958 --> 1:36:42.791
cannot wait to join the NBA family.

1:36:42.875 --> 1:36:44.041
So let's begin.

1:36:44.750 --> 1:36:47.083
The Cleveland Cavaliers select…

1:36:48.416 --> 1:36:49.791
Anthony Bennett.

1:36:54.125 --> 1:36:55.833
Welcome to the NBA Draft, gentlemen.

1:36:57.875 --> 1:36:59.500
Anthony Bennett.

1:36:59.583 --> 1:37:03.791
You saw the disappointment on Noel's face
that he wasn't selected number one.

1:37:04.625 --> 1:37:06.041
The second pick.

1:37:06.125 --> 1:37:12.791
The Orlando Magic select Victor Oladipo
from Indiana University.

1:37:12.875 --> 1:37:16.125
Otto Porter Jr. of Georgetown University.

1:37:16.208 --> 1:37:18.333
Nerlens Noel
from the University of Kentucky.

1:37:18.416 --> 1:37:21.041

1:37:27.291 --> 1:37:30.166
CJ McCollum from Lehigh University.

1:37:36.375 --> 1:37:41.208
With the 11th pick in the 2013 NBA Draft,

1:37:41.291 --> 1:37:44.291
the Philadelphia 76ers select

1:37:44.375 --> 1:37:48.291
Michael Carter-Williams
from Syracuse University.

1:37:51.250 --> 1:37:55.250
What even is a 76er?
Seventy-sixes cannot play basketball.

1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:57.375
It's okay. Don't worry.

1:37:57.458 --> 1:38:01.500
We have five more picks including Utah.
All the way down to Boston at 16.

1:38:01.583 --> 1:38:02.958
Oklahoma's next at 12.

1:38:05.750 --> 1:38:10.666
With the 12th pick,
the Oklahoma City Thunder select

1:38:10.750 --> 1:38:14.875
-Steven Adams from Rotorua, New Zealand…
-This is crazy. I can't take this.

1:38:14.958 --> 1:38:16.666
…and the University of Pittsburgh.

The Utah Jazz select Shabazz Muhammad.

1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:36.083
It's gonna be okay. Keep hopeful.

1:38:36.791 --> 1:38:38.125
What if nobody picks him?

1:38:45.208 --> 1:38:47.416
Maybe they can find a first rounder

1:38:47.500 --> 1:38:49.416
who can help lift their spirits a bit.

1:38:49.500 --> 1:38:50.750
Fifteenth overall.

1:38:50.833 --> 1:38:53.500
Bucks, of course,
having to rebuild their roster just a bit.

1:38:54.333 --> 1:38:55.583
What about Milwaukee?

1:38:56.250 --> 1:38:58.041
Milwaukee hasn't called me back yet.

1:39:02.708 --> 1:39:04.875
We see the clock has expired

1:39:04.958 --> 1:39:07.666
and David Stern
about to announce the selection.

1:39:50.458 --> 1:39:55.708

in the 2013 NBA Draft,

1:39:56.791 --> 1:40:00.583
the Milwaukee Bucks select…

1:40:02.791 --> 1:40:05.416
Giannis Antetokounmpo.

1:40:10.083 --> 1:40:11.333
Yeah!

1:40:29.375 --> 1:40:31.000
Yeah!

1:40:33.041 --> 1:40:35.041
I told them! I told you! I told you!

1:40:41.625 --> 1:40:44.250
Yeah, man! All right!

1:40:50.333 --> 1:40:52.000
-Yeah, Kevin!
-Whoo!

1:41:06.791 --> 1:41:08.458
Oh, man.

1:41:32.208 --> 1:41:35.416
Antetokounmpo.
A very special night for him.

1:41:35.500 --> 1:41:40.791
His parents from right to left.
Mother, Veronica. Father, Charles.

1:41:40.875 --> 1:41:45.666
Brother, Alex. And sixteen-year-old,
6'7" Kostas Antetokounmpo!

1:42:10.458 --> 1:42:11.625
I want to thank my dad.

1:42:11.708 --> 1:42:13.000
Um…

1:42:13.083 --> 1:42:16.250
Obviously, you know,
my dad is not here with me, but, uh…

1:42:19.125 --> 1:42:22.291
Every day that I step on the floor,
I always think about my dad,

1:42:22.375 --> 1:42:25.625
and that motivates me
and pushes me to, you know, play harder.

1:42:27.083 --> 1:42:30.916
I want to thank my amazing brothers.
You know I love you guys.

1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:36.708
I want to thank my amazing mom.
She's my hero.

1:42:36.791 --> 1:42:39.125
When you are a little kid,
you don't see the future, right?

1:42:39.208 --> 1:42:44.416
And if you have a good parent,
your parent sees the future for you.

1:42:44.500 --> 1:42:48.666
And she always saw the future in us.
She always believe in us. My true hero.

1:43:02.208 --> 1:43:04.666
That is an awesome shot.

1:43:05.750 --> 1:43:07.500
Kostas Antetokounmpo!

1:43:13.291 --> 1:43:16.000
Another three from Alex. Got it.

1:43:24.625 --> 1:43:26.333
I'm so proud of him.

1:43:26.416 --> 1:43:30.958
-We love you so much. Congratulations.
-We're proud of you. We love you.

1:43:31.041 --> 1:43:34.791
We're extremely happy for you
for bringing the first ring home.

1:43:34.875 --> 1:43:36.833
Let's get more rings, man.
Let's get more rings. Come on.

1:43:39.625 --> 1:43:43.250
Shot blocked by Antetokounmpo!
What a block from Giannis!

1:43:50.041 --> 1:43:53.916
Giannis. Slam it! How about that?

1:43:57.125 --> 1:44:00.125
Only the seventh player
in the history of the Finals

1:44:00.208 --> 1:44:01.958
to have a fifty-point game!

1:44:02.041 --> 1:44:03.333
And that'll do it!

1:44:04.166 --> 1:44:07.208
The Milwaukee Bucks
are NBA champions once again!

1:44:07.291 --> 1:44:10.083
Finals MVP,
Giannis Antetokounmpo!

1:44:10.166 --> 1:44:12.541
MVP! MVP!

1:44:12.625 --> 1:44:17.833
MVP! MVP! MVP! MVP!

1:44:17.916 --> 1:44:20.625
MVP! MVP!

1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:09.208
-Let's do it again.
-Whoo!

1:51:09.291 --> 1:51:10.291
Yeah.
