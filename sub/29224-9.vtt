00:38.830 --> 00:42.083
Well, of course you know
Justin Foley is a drug addict?

00:44.377 --> 00:45.712
<i>Well, you need to...</i>

00:46.296 --> 00:47.422
<i>for where we're going.</i>

00:50.633 --> 00:51.633
What?

00:52.761 --> 00:53.762
What's going on?

00:54.387 --> 00:55.387
Yeah.

00:55.805 --> 00:56.848
You tell me.

01:00.310 --> 01:03.104
- You went through my fucking shit?
- Let's skip the righteous anger

01:03.188 --> 01:05.828
and fast forward to you explaining
why you have an Oxy prescription

01:05.899 --> 01:07.901
- in the name of Bryce Walker.
- Fuck.

01:08.735 --> 01:09.778
Okay. Look, Clay.

01:09.861 --> 01:10.945
- Are you using again?
- No!

01:11.029 --> 01:13.198
- I don't believe you.
- I'm... I'm not!

01:13.531 --> 01:15.241
Jesus, Clay, I swear.

01:15.325 --> 01:18.086
You told me that the last time
you saw Bryce was at the end of summer.

01:18.119 --> 01:20.719
This prescription is from a month ago.
You guys stayed in contact.

01:20.789 --> 01:22.165
He sold these to you, didn't he?

01:22.624 --> 01:23.625
You've got it all wrong.

01:23.708 --> 01:26.086
Then explain it to me.
Where did you find the pills?

01:26.419 --> 01:27.629
At the Chatham house.

01:28.838 --> 01:29.881
Bryce's funeral.

01:31.466 --> 01:33.843
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not! Dude, you...

01:34.761 --> 01:35.887
You saw me.

01:36.304 --> 01:38.473
Upstairs, in the hallway. Remember?

01:39.390 --> 01:41.851
I told you I was looking for the bathroom.

01:43.311 --> 01:46.773
I had just taken the Oxy
from Bryce's bathroom, that's...

01:47.649 --> 01:48.969
That's why I was acting so weird,

01:49.025 --> 01:51.236
but I'm telling you,
it was just that once.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.076
It was just that day.

01:59.077 --> 02:01.788
Bryce was dead,
and I was all fucked up.

02:01.871 --> 02:04.082
And I just went to look
for a place to chill,

02:04.165 --> 02:06.501
and suddenly, I was in Bryce's room and...

02:07.252 --> 02:08.669
it was fucking with my head.

02:09.795 --> 02:13.299
I just felt empty and messed up and...

02:14.884 --> 02:15.885
just alone.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.725
- So, it was just one time?
- Yeah.

02:24.227 --> 02:25.228
I fucked up.

02:27.730 --> 02:29.232
I'm sorry. I'm really...

02:30.984 --> 02:32.443
I'm really sorry.

02:33.361 --> 02:34.361
Just please...

02:36.447 --> 02:37.574
don't tell your folks.

02:39.617 --> 02:40.994
<i>Because life with an addict</i>

02:43.705 --> 02:45.582
<i>means you never know what to believe.</i>

02:50.044 --> 02:52.338
<i>You're always waiting
for the next bad news.</i>

02:56.467 --> 02:57.552
What happened?

02:57.760 --> 02:58.928
Clay, honey, sit down.

02:59.596 --> 03:00.889
I don't want to sit down.

03:03.683 --> 03:05.810
You've officially been named
a person of interest

03:05.894 --> 03:06.895
by the Sheriff.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.980
He held a press conference
this morning.

03:09.063 --> 03:11.524
- A press conference?
- What does that mean?

03:11.608 --> 03:13.408
"A person of interest?"
What the fuck is that?

03:13.443 --> 03:15.445
Character assassination is what it is.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.906
- It's a tactic.
- It means nothing legally.

03:17.989 --> 03:19.029
Doesn't feel like nothing.

03:19.073 --> 03:21.552
- Feels like they're about to arrest me!
- They can't.

03:21.576 --> 03:24.829
They don't have enough.
So they try to put public pressure on you.

03:25.163 --> 03:27.207
They don't have the evidence
to call you a suspect,

03:27.290 --> 03:28.333
but they want you scared.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.019
- Well done, then.
- Maybe it's best

03:30.043 --> 03:32.587
- if you boys stay home from school today.
- No.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.839
No way. We're not doing that.

03:35.465 --> 03:36.925
- Clay...
- You can stay home.

03:37.258 --> 03:40.136
No, of course not.
I've got your back. That's what we do.

03:43.514 --> 03:45.683
Let's get a coffee on the way and talk.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.314
<i>And then the bad news gets worse.</i>

03:52.899 --> 03:55.068
<i>And it feels like the world is closing in.</i>

03:57.528 --> 03:58.528
Taken?

04:00.198 --> 04:02.318
- Knock yourself out.
- Yeah, I should hope not.

04:02.825 --> 04:05.203
Coffee's supposed to do the opposite
of that, right?

04:08.623 --> 04:09.624
No school today?

04:12.669 --> 04:14.003
It starts in half an hour.

04:15.630 --> 04:17.589
Yeah. I'm surprised you're going.

04:20.301 --> 04:21.301
I'm sorry?

04:24.806 --> 04:26.849
After the police named you
a person of interest

04:26.933 --> 04:29.477
in Bryce Walker's murder.
How does that feel?

04:29.560 --> 04:30.560
What the...

04:30.937 --> 04:32.730
- Who are you?
- Austin James.

04:33.022 --> 04:36.192
I write for <i>The Evergreen County Register.</i>
Just want to chat about the case.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.402
Hey, get the fuck out.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.196
Just enjoying a cup of coffee.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.990
All right, then we'll get the fuck out.

04:42.073 --> 04:44.951
If you come in here again, I'll see to it
that your coffee is pissed in.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.417
- Thanks for the save.
- Yeah. What a dick.

04:53.042 --> 04:54.294
<i>And here's the thing.</i>

04:55.628 --> 04:57.755
<i>When they made Clay a person of interest</i>

04:58.381 --> 05:00.550
<i>the searchlight shone on Justin, as well.</i>

05:01.301 --> 05:03.303
<i>So, it was only a matter of time...</i>

05:04.012 --> 05:05.013
You need a spot?

05:06.848 --> 05:08.391
<i>...until his secrets came out.</i>

05:10.143 --> 05:11.144
Yeah, not from you.

05:11.853 --> 05:13.438
Man, your boy Clay is in some shit.

05:13.521 --> 05:17.442
Hey, Clay in shit.
He should change his name to shit.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.571
- Dude, you are so fucking stupid.
- You feeling all right?

05:22.322 --> 05:23.364
You look kinda sick.

05:27.785 --> 05:29.787
Did your boy find your stash?

05:30.079 --> 05:31.956
What the fuck do you know about it?

05:32.999 --> 05:34.042
I pay attention.

05:34.959 --> 05:36.252
Kind of made me wonder...

05:36.794 --> 05:39.714
what if Brycey found out
you were using again,

05:40.423 --> 05:41.966
so you and Shit took him out?

05:43.134 --> 05:44.802
You know, Clay thinks you did it.

05:46.220 --> 05:48.973
He's just desperate.
It's not like he's got anything.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.392
I think he's got something.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.103
I think he knows exactly...

05:54.645 --> 05:55.646
why you did it.

05:56.564 --> 05:58.733
So either two things
could have happened:

05:59.609 --> 06:00.610
you did do it...

06:02.487 --> 06:03.738
or maybe Clay and I did.

06:06.657 --> 06:07.784
Maybe you're next.

06:14.916 --> 06:17.251
<i>Clay felt every set of eyes on him,</i>

06:18.294 --> 06:20.171
<i>desperately searching for a way out,</i>

06:21.339 --> 06:23.883
<i>desperately hoping
the answer wasn't Justin.</i>

06:34.310 --> 06:35.603
Ignore the chatter.

06:37.522 --> 06:38.523
It's pretty loud.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.233
Well, don't talk back.

06:40.733 --> 06:44.237
- You mean don't defend myself?
- It doesn't matter what you say,

06:44.320 --> 06:45.613
it matters how you seem.

06:46.447 --> 06:47.657
And you seem angry.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.242
Guilty people get angry.

06:49.325 --> 06:51.911
Maybe people who are falsely accused
get more angry.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.497
But you're still not sure
which one I am, right?

06:56.165 --> 06:57.165
Oh,

06:57.333 --> 06:59.919
and your precious Bryce was doing Oxy.

07:01.045 --> 07:02.338
What makes you think that?

07:02.839 --> 07:05.120
Because Justin stole some
from his room after the funeral.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.428
Is that what Justin told you?

07:10.513 --> 07:11.556
And you believe him?

07:13.724 --> 07:14.851
I believe it of Bryce.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.400
I should've told him everything I knew.

07:23.818 --> 07:24.818
But...

07:25.945 --> 07:28.614
But he was right,
I hadn't made my mind up yet.

07:30.241 --> 07:32.660
<i>And your press conference worked
on me.</i>

07:33.953 --> 07:35.329
Did Bryce ever deal Oxy?

07:37.248 --> 07:38.708
No, Bryce did not deal Oxy.

07:39.375 --> 07:40.543
How can you be so sure?

07:40.751 --> 07:43.796
Uh, 'cause I tried to buy some from him
and he flat-out refused.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.047
Why would you need it?

07:45.298 --> 07:47.341
Sprained hamstring from lifting.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.687
I wanted something
to push through the pain,

07:49.719 --> 07:52.359
but he wouldn't give it to me.
He said that shit was too addictive.

07:53.764 --> 07:55.349
That's oddly considerate.

07:55.808 --> 07:57.226
Yeah, I thought so.

07:59.812 --> 08:02.148
So, why do you want to know
if Bryce dealt Oxy?

08:03.691 --> 08:05.443
Um, you know, um...

08:05.860 --> 08:07.780
I'm trying to figure out
who may have killed him.

08:08.279 --> 08:10.740
- It wasn't me.
- Where does the Oxy come in?

08:12.074 --> 08:13.075
I don't know.

08:14.118 --> 08:16.204
Gentlemen. Solve, please.

08:18.206 --> 08:20.458
<i>But while everyone
was looking at Clay,</i>

08:21.792 --> 08:23.294
<i>I was thinking about Justin.</i>

08:30.843 --> 08:31.843
Hey.

08:34.554 --> 08:38.058
- I suck. I've been totally avoiding you.
- I don't blame you.

08:40.061 --> 08:44.106
Alex really fucked shit up for you.
Using me.

08:45.107 --> 08:47.902
So, transitively,
I fucked shit up for you.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.528
Math.

08:50.655 --> 08:51.864
It's not your fault.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.201
It fucking feels like it.

08:56.744 --> 08:58.454
All I do is mess up your life.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.667
I'm the hypocrite,

09:03.251 --> 09:04.251
not you.

09:06.963 --> 09:07.963
Jess, I...

09:09.590 --> 09:11.175
I don't want this to be over.

09:14.929 --> 09:16.222
I don't either.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.727
Okay. So, maybe we just...

09:24.313 --> 09:27.692
go back on the down-low
till all this settles?

09:29.443 --> 09:30.443
No.

09:32.363 --> 09:35.032
No, I'm supposed to be
living my truth, right?

09:35.950 --> 09:39.579
Well, the truth is
that I love your lame ass, Justin Foley.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.254
People are gonna talk about us.

09:49.463 --> 09:51.299
People always talk about us.

09:55.803 --> 09:56.803
Fuck 'em.

10:04.228 --> 10:05.980
- Fuck 'em.
- Fuck!

10:07.940 --> 10:11.611
No way. No, if Justin were using,
he would've been caught. We were tested.

10:13.195 --> 10:15.948
Well, he told me he only used once
a few weeks ago.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.089
Would that have been
after you got tested?

10:19.118 --> 10:21.912
Maybe he got lucky
and the timing worked out, I don't know.

10:21.996 --> 10:24.332
Or maybe you knew he was using
and you helped him?

10:24.415 --> 10:28.210
No. No way. I won't put up
with that shit, okay? We play clean.

10:30.463 --> 10:33.090
He's been doing well, Clay.

10:33.174 --> 10:36.177
Football's been good for him,
you know it has. He's healthy.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.304
Yeah, I thought he was.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.974
- I hoped...
- He's healthy, okay?

10:43.184 --> 10:45.624
I mean, that's the whole reason
I got him to play last summer.

10:47.271 --> 10:50.399
<i>Zach, I don't need
a fucking lecture, all right?</i>

10:52.568 --> 10:56.238
Dude, that shit will rot your insides.
Have you seen what it does to a penny?

10:56.447 --> 10:58.407
Have you seen
what I've done to my insides?

10:58.741 --> 11:02.370
So, summer school's over. We start
two days next week. Perfect timing.

11:02.912 --> 11:07.041
- Except I have no desire to play again.
- Dude, we need you, and you need football.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.186
I'm not letting this go, man.

11:09.210 --> 11:10.544
Zach Dempsey always gets the yes.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.630
Zach Dempsey has gotten the yes
exactly once.

11:12.713 --> 11:13.713
Fuck off!

11:18.010 --> 11:21.305
- I'm just... I'm not that guy anymore.
- You're not what guy?

11:21.764 --> 11:24.308
Not the guy that needs
to rediscover his competitive fire?

11:24.684 --> 11:27.895
Not the guy who needs brotherhood
and fellowship in his life?

11:27.978 --> 11:31.899
Not the guy who needs to rebuild
his once athletic body?

11:34.151 --> 11:35.778
Correct. I'm none of those guys.

11:35.861 --> 11:36.904
- Dude!
- Dude.

11:36.987 --> 11:38.489
- Dude!
- Dude.

11:39.740 --> 11:40.574
Dude.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.035
What the hell?

11:43.577 --> 11:44.577
Dude!

11:45.579 --> 11:46.747
Are you throwing grapes

11:47.665 --> 11:48.666
all over my bed?

11:49.333 --> 11:51.043
Well, it's the international semi-finals

11:51.127 --> 11:53.247
for the Olympic-qualifying
Grape Throwing Competition.

11:53.295 --> 11:54.588
What are you even doing here?

11:54.672 --> 11:57.174
I'm not leaving until Justin agrees
to do football this year.

11:57.383 --> 11:58.884
He thinks it'd be good for me.

11:59.844 --> 12:02.096
I mean, it probably would be, wouldn't it?

12:03.264 --> 12:06.225
He agrees with me.
Holy shit, Clay actually agrees with me!

12:08.811 --> 12:11.731
Hey, stop fucking throwing grapes
at my bed, okay?

12:13.357 --> 12:16.193
Hey, that's not funny!
Go outside and play! Hey! What the...

12:16.277 --> 12:18.237
Justin! What the fuck?

12:18.863 --> 12:20.463
- All right.
- All right.

12:21.657 --> 12:22.783
You're cleaning this up!

12:22.867 --> 12:24.147
- Uh-huh.
- Nope!

12:27.830 --> 12:30.666
<i>Justin hoped football would help him
find himself again.</i>

12:31.375 --> 12:32.375
Up!

12:32.710 --> 12:35.463
Get the knees up!
Heels straight up under the body! Up!

12:36.213 --> 12:37.213
Up!

12:38.507 --> 12:41.260
Down! Come on. Don't stop. Come on.

12:42.803 --> 12:44.430
Push-ups. Let's go, don't stop.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.517
Two laps, let's go. Go!

12:49.018 --> 12:50.018
Go!

12:51.061 --> 12:54.440
Foley, come on. Get moving, man.
You quit out here, you quit in a game.

12:55.399 --> 12:58.986
Yeah, maybe I should just quit now
and save everyone the trouble.

13:01.113 --> 13:04.366
Yeah, you're right. Just walk away.
You're not even worth it.

13:07.203 --> 13:09.455
- You want me to go?
- You got a reason to stay?

13:10.498 --> 13:13.334
I can't give it to you.
You gotta find that for yourself.

13:16.754 --> 13:17.838
Okay, I'll go.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.059
Yeah, go back
to what you were doing before.

13:20.090 --> 13:21.801
Go do some drugs. Like white trash do.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.594
Hey, what the fuck did you just say to me?

13:23.677 --> 13:26.347
Hey, back off
and watch that language. That's a mile.

13:26.430 --> 13:28.891
- You can't talk to me like that.
- Yeah, you're right.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.726
I got no idea where you come from.

13:31.727 --> 13:33.145
Hey, where'd you score? Huh?

13:33.979 --> 13:34.979
Down on Fifth?

13:36.023 --> 13:37.024
Down by the docks?

13:39.276 --> 13:41.278
Yeah. Yeah, I don't know you.

13:41.987 --> 13:45.574
All I know is you go back there,
you ain't getting back out again.

13:46.867 --> 13:50.454
So, you run that track, two miles,
or you just run the hell out of here.

13:50.538 --> 13:52.599
- Don't even look back.
- How's it two miles already?

13:52.623 --> 13:53.624
You want three?

13:54.750 --> 13:55.750
Go.

13:57.294 --> 13:58.294
Go!

14:00.089 --> 14:02.842
<i>The way back isn't ever easy.</i>

14:04.301 --> 14:07.054
You can't eliminate student council
funding for the football team.

14:07.137 --> 14:09.223
You have plenty of funding
from the district.

14:09.348 --> 14:12.351
You have more funding than the drama
and music programs put together.

14:12.434 --> 14:14.937
We have more guys involved
than music and drama put together.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.020
We have four teams.

14:16.063 --> 14:18.899
I promised I would do everything I could
to eradicate jock culture.

14:18.983 --> 14:21.193
But you can't say
that jock culture is this or that,

14:21.277 --> 14:22.862
there isn't just one culture.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.362
And...

14:24.822 --> 14:26.502
I mean, we're changing things around here.

14:26.532 --> 14:30.327
Male athletic programs
not only protect athletes

14:30.411 --> 14:31.871
who commit sexual assault,

14:31.954 --> 14:34.832
they foster a culture
of violence and aggression

14:34.915 --> 14:36.625
that creates rapists every day.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.001
Jess...

14:40.212 --> 14:41.255
some guys do shit.

14:43.257 --> 14:44.717
Athletes and non-athletes.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.302
But for lots of guys,

14:46.385 --> 14:48.846
football's their only shot
at a college scholarship.

14:49.305 --> 14:52.266
Football, athletics,
for some people they're a lifeline.

14:52.349 --> 14:53.349
Like who?

14:53.559 --> 14:54.559
Like me.

14:56.353 --> 14:59.106
Look, I didn't want
to come back to football, but...

15:00.441 --> 15:01.483
once I did, it...

15:03.444 --> 15:05.696
it got me out of bed in the morning
and it...

15:06.822 --> 15:09.533
got me back in myself and shit that...

15:13.370 --> 15:15.456
I feel like myself for the first time...

15:16.749 --> 15:17.917
in a really long time.

15:19.460 --> 15:20.460
Look,

15:20.836 --> 15:22.046
cut our funding or don't.

15:23.088 --> 15:24.757
In the end, you're not gonna win.

15:25.674 --> 15:27.134
Because we're not gonna give up.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.016
He's passed every drug test,

15:34.975 --> 15:36.143
hasn't missed a practice.

15:36.769 --> 15:37.770
He's in good shape.

15:40.689 --> 15:41.857
I want to believe that.

15:43.943 --> 15:44.943
So, do.

15:46.403 --> 15:48.906
<i>Some wanted to believe
the best of Justin.</i>

15:52.576 --> 15:53.869
<i>Some never could.</i>

15:55.955 --> 15:58.207
You need to tell Jess
that you're using again.

16:01.335 --> 16:02.503
Did Clay tell you that?

16:03.420 --> 16:04.672
It's true, isn't it?

16:04.964 --> 16:07.549
- Did Clay tell you?
- No, but you are.

16:08.676 --> 16:09.510
Using.

16:09.593 --> 16:11.387
What the fuck does it matter to you?

16:11.845 --> 16:14.431
You're just looking for another reason
to be pissed at me?

16:15.224 --> 16:17.977
- To fuck things up between me and Jess?
- Yeah and no.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.020
I do think
that you're a worthless piece of shit

16:20.104 --> 16:21.605
that doesn't deserve her, but...

16:21.981 --> 16:24.274
she seems to love you
for whatever reason.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.151
But you can't deal with that?

16:26.652 --> 16:29.113
I've been dealing with it
for two years now, asshole,

16:29.196 --> 16:31.031
while you've been destroying her life.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.618
- When are you gonna fucking quit?
- When are you?

16:35.202 --> 16:36.370
She deserves the truth.

16:43.419 --> 16:45.462
<i>While Justin started to spiral...</i>

16:46.797 --> 16:50.009
<i>Clay took refuge
in one of the few friends he had left.</i>

16:51.677 --> 16:52.677
Hey.

16:53.137 --> 16:54.137
Hey.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.016
Uh... what's up?

16:59.601 --> 17:00.686
Just checking on you.

17:02.771 --> 17:03.771
You okay?

17:05.733 --> 17:07.108
Shouldn't I be asking you?

17:09.653 --> 17:10.654
You saw the news?

17:10.988 --> 17:13.365
Yeah. I kinda think everyone did.

17:16.076 --> 17:18.912
For what it's worth,
you've always been interesting to me.

17:19.371 --> 17:20.705
As a person.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.753
That was supposed to be a joke.

17:26.837 --> 17:28.547
Maybe it's not a time for jokes.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.175
Maybe I'm not good at jokes. Um...

17:33.010 --> 17:35.429
Little bit of both, but thanks for trying.

17:38.015 --> 17:39.850
Hey, would it be stupid if I...

17:40.976 --> 17:42.061
gave you some advice?

17:43.395 --> 17:44.938
About something I know about?

17:45.481 --> 17:46.481
Um...

17:47.232 --> 17:48.275
No, not...

17:49.068 --> 17:50.360
Not stupid. What's up?

17:53.781 --> 17:56.658
When people stare at you and talk...

17:58.077 --> 18:01.455
or they don't stare but you can tell
that they want to, just...

18:02.998 --> 18:05.000
just remember that you know who you are,

18:05.959 --> 18:06.959
and they don't.

18:10.714 --> 18:11.714
Right.

18:14.927 --> 18:15.927
Thanks, Ty.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.477
<i>Clay knew who he was...</i>

18:27.564 --> 18:30.234
<i>but he wasn't sure
he knew who Justin was anymore.</i>

18:34.571 --> 18:39.827
<i>And without Justin, it felt to him
like Clay Jensen versus the world.</i>

18:51.922 --> 18:53.048
No, thank you.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.551
<i>And he was so tired of that feeling.</i>

19:06.311 --> 19:07.563
Hot off the press.

19:13.235 --> 19:15.529
Issue 140. Sweet.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.114
Wait, hold on.

19:17.197 --> 19:19.783
We finally find out
if Percy forgives Astrid

19:19.867 --> 19:23.328
for leaving him for dead on Rykon 7,
and all you've got is "sweet?"

19:26.623 --> 19:28.792
I thought maybe we could read it together.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.964
No, it's okay. I'll... I'm just gonna...
I'll pick it up later.

19:36.049 --> 19:37.426
You're still angry with me.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.680
I was never angry with you.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.726
Are you sure
you know what anger feels like?

19:47.311 --> 19:48.353
I'm not angry.

19:55.652 --> 19:56.652
My, uh...

19:57.946 --> 19:59.031
friend...

19:59.531 --> 20:00.531
Hannah,

20:01.241 --> 20:02.784
I told you about her?

20:03.994 --> 20:04.995
Not much.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.204
Well...

20:06.747 --> 20:08.248
she, uh...

20:09.708 --> 20:11.293
She killed herself.

20:12.669 --> 20:13.879
A year ago today.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.007
Sweet Jesus, I'm...

20:19.092 --> 20:20.093
I'm so sorry.

20:21.595 --> 20:23.597
No, it's okay. It's just, it's...

20:25.349 --> 20:26.433
It's been on my mind.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.226
I'm sure.

20:28.977 --> 20:30.312
Do you want to talk about it?

20:33.065 --> 20:34.107
No, I don't.

20:35.317 --> 20:36.317
Okay.

20:39.363 --> 20:41.406
Well, would you like me to sit with you?

20:46.078 --> 20:47.162
What is this?

20:48.372 --> 20:49.372
That we're doing?

20:51.291 --> 20:52.876
Being friends?

20:53.752 --> 20:54.920
Okay, yeah, but...

20:56.255 --> 21:00.050
you started this friendship, not me.
I didn't even want any more friends.

21:00.133 --> 21:02.469
The ones I have are already a whole lot,
so...

21:05.222 --> 21:06.223
We both have...

21:07.766 --> 21:09.351
complicated lives.

21:09.434 --> 21:12.562
I thought maybe we could be
something simple for each other.

21:12.896 --> 21:15.107
And not have to talk about everything.

21:15.399 --> 21:16.900
And what if nothing's simple?

21:17.901 --> 21:19.611
What if everything's complicated?

21:20.946 --> 21:22.072
What do we do then?

21:24.157 --> 21:25.575
I don't know, exactly.

21:35.794 --> 21:37.504
Hey, man. Mind if we join you?

21:40.340 --> 21:41.425
No, not at all.

21:42.676 --> 21:44.886
This healthy school lunch thing
is the worst.

21:45.345 --> 21:48.849
- Hey, my mom could bag you a lunch.
- Are you eating three sandwiches?

21:49.433 --> 21:50.433
I'm growing.

21:50.767 --> 21:53.478
God, I hope not.
You're like a fucking giant.

21:54.855 --> 21:56.606
Clay, man, we should hang out more.

21:58.191 --> 21:59.191
Yeah.

21:59.568 --> 22:00.736
No, we totally should.

22:06.867 --> 22:07.867
Um...

22:09.536 --> 22:11.621
you know I didn't kill Bryce, right?

22:13.832 --> 22:14.875
Oh, yeah, totally.

22:15.542 --> 22:18.295
We don't hang out with murderers,
only the dispossessed.

22:18.628 --> 22:21.423
I don't know what that word means,
but right on.

22:22.924 --> 22:24.968
<i>Clay had people who believed him.</i>

22:25.427 --> 22:27.804
<i>I decided I was one of those people.</i>

22:28.513 --> 22:29.514
Clay!

22:30.891 --> 22:31.891
Clay!

22:33.977 --> 22:35.896
- What is it?
- Justin was lying to you.

22:38.315 --> 22:39.316
Why do you say that?

22:39.399 --> 22:42.861
He's told you he stole a bottle
after the funeral? Just a one-off?

22:44.112 --> 22:45.489
Yeah, a one-time relapse.

22:45.572 --> 22:48.075
He says he found the pills
in Bryce's bedroom during the wake.

22:48.158 --> 22:49.158
He's lying.

22:49.618 --> 22:52.704
After the police found Bryce's
steroid stash at the crime scene,

22:52.788 --> 22:54.122
they swept his room clean.

22:56.291 --> 22:57.292
Wait, what?

23:01.713 --> 23:02.713
Shit!

23:09.388 --> 23:10.388
Hey, there.

23:10.555 --> 23:11.807
Jess, not now.

23:12.057 --> 23:13.266
What? We're public.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.769
Yeah, and it feels like
you're making a big show out of it.

23:15.852 --> 23:17.687
What the hell does that mean?

23:18.146 --> 23:20.066
It means that it doesn't feel like
it's about us,

23:20.148 --> 23:21.483
it feels like it's about you.

23:21.691 --> 23:24.361
It's not! What's going on with you?

23:24.444 --> 23:26.446
Just stop using me
to make a fucking point!

23:26.613 --> 23:27.613
I'm not!

23:27.823 --> 23:32.452
The only point I'm making is that
I love you and that's all that matters.

23:32.536 --> 23:33.662
Okay, well, you...

23:34.246 --> 23:36.248
you shouldn't love me. You shouldn't.

23:36.706 --> 23:37.791
What? Why not?

23:39.876 --> 23:41.503
Because I'm fucking bad for you!

23:42.212 --> 23:44.506
Hey, what are you saying right now?

23:45.424 --> 23:47.134
Talk to me. What's going on?

23:54.724 --> 23:55.725
I cheated on you.

23:57.018 --> 23:59.229
- What?
- I said I cheated on you!

24:00.689 --> 24:01.690
I don't believe you.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.942
Okay, well, it's true. You should.

24:05.402 --> 24:06.402
When?

24:06.820 --> 24:09.573
- When did this happen?
- Homecoming night.

24:11.283 --> 24:14.578
You tried to call me. That's where I was.
I was with some other girl.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.288
Who?

24:19.082 --> 24:20.333
Jess, it doesn't matter.

24:22.335 --> 24:24.588
You just shouldn't be with me, okay?

24:28.300 --> 24:29.301
It's fucking over.

24:34.931 --> 24:37.517
<i>The Oxy that you stole
from Bryce's room,</i>

24:39.936 --> 24:41.438
where exactly did you find it?

24:44.524 --> 24:45.525
It was, um...

24:47.194 --> 24:49.654
It was in his medicine cabinet.
In the bathroom.

24:50.030 --> 24:52.908
Lies are harder to remember
than the truth, aren't they?

24:53.492 --> 24:55.243
I cleaned that bathroom out myself.

24:56.328 --> 24:57.621
You didn't find anything.

24:59.706 --> 25:00.790
Was he selling?

25:01.291 --> 25:02.626
And did you owe him money?

25:03.502 --> 25:06.171
Why would I kill Bryce
after he saved my fucking life?

25:13.386 --> 25:14.386
There you go.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.101
- Extra hot, please.
- Yeah.

25:22.437 --> 25:23.897
I like it when it burns.

25:24.856 --> 25:26.274
What the fuck are you doing here?

25:26.816 --> 25:28.318
I just got out of County.

25:30.028 --> 25:33.740
I had four long months
to think about all the money you owe me.

25:37.369 --> 25:38.453
I don't owe you shit.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.794
Either you pay me or you work.

25:46.294 --> 25:47.504
No, I'm not doing that.

25:48.630 --> 25:49.631
Then pay me.

25:55.720 --> 25:56.888
Can we not do this here?

25:58.431 --> 25:59.891
You meet me out back in five.

27:12.088 --> 27:13.757
Rookie fucking mistake.

27:13.840 --> 27:17.302
Did you really think my customers
wouldn't notice you skimming off the top?

27:17.385 --> 27:19.346
- Fuck, Seth.
- You little junkie shit!

27:19.429 --> 27:21.056
- Let me explain.
- No, shut up!

27:21.765 --> 27:24.392
I don't want to hear any
of your bullshit excuses, Justin!

27:27.812 --> 27:30.440
I tried to give you a chance
to work off your debt.

27:31.149 --> 27:33.360
Now I just want my fucking money.

27:33.610 --> 27:35.487
- All right.
- I want 2,000.

27:35.987 --> 27:39.532
For what you owe and what you stole.
And I want it tomorrow.

27:40.700 --> 27:43.828
- I can't get it to you that fast, man.
- No?

27:45.664 --> 27:48.917
Then maybe you're gonna have to ask
your new rich family for help.

27:50.585 --> 27:52.212
Or maybe I'll ask them myself.

27:53.213 --> 27:55.590
- No, I'll do it. I'll take care of it.
- Yeah, you will.

28:02.514 --> 28:03.514
Fuck...

28:34.713 --> 28:35.713
Thank you.

28:36.631 --> 28:37.631
Yeah.

28:38.341 --> 28:39.341
You okay?

28:41.010 --> 28:42.010
Yeah.

28:45.932 --> 28:46.932
My lawyer...

28:47.934 --> 28:49.936
They made it all go away.

28:51.020 --> 28:53.523
I mean, they only had you
for a misdemeanor anyway,

28:54.190 --> 28:56.192
because apparently,
you smoked it all

28:56.276 --> 28:57.569
before they got there.

29:01.823 --> 29:03.241
They didn't call your mom?

29:06.077 --> 29:07.495
They tried. She's long gone.

29:08.955 --> 29:11.040
Yeah, right. You're with the Jensens now.

29:12.751 --> 29:15.211
- The cops didn't know that.
- Right. Right, right.

29:19.924 --> 29:20.924
Can you...

29:24.179 --> 29:25.680
Could you give me a ride home?

29:27.056 --> 29:28.308
Yeah, man. Of course.

29:30.185 --> 29:34.397
Hey, listen. The deputy told my lawyer
that Seth is back in town.

29:35.732 --> 29:37.358
Are you caught up with him?

29:39.986 --> 29:40.987
- Justin...
- I...

29:42.947 --> 29:45.325
I can handle it. Okay?

29:46.075 --> 29:47.075
Okay.

29:48.119 --> 29:50.789
But you know I'm here for you, right?
For anything.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.293
- Yeah, I know.
- Okay.

29:56.377 --> 29:58.797
I'm your brother forever, no matter what.

30:01.299 --> 30:02.842
<i>He couldn't call the Jensens.</i>

30:04.344 --> 30:05.470
He had no one else.

30:06.679 --> 30:09.098
And, in a way, neither did Bryce.

30:11.226 --> 30:13.228
<i>So, they had each other.</i>

30:15.605 --> 30:17.023
Who the fuck is Abercrombie?

30:18.149 --> 30:19.149
He's my friend.

30:19.776 --> 30:21.736
- I know you from somewhere?
- No, you don't.

30:21.820 --> 30:25.323
He's got the money.
Can we just get this done with already?

30:27.951 --> 30:28.993
Okay, let's see it.

30:32.789 --> 30:33.998
This is 5,000.

30:34.666 --> 30:35.875
To cover Justin's debt,

30:36.668 --> 30:38.378
and to make sure that you leave him alone,

30:38.962 --> 30:39.962
for good.

30:40.588 --> 30:42.173
And what are you gonna do if I don't?

30:42.674 --> 30:46.177
Then I guess you're gonna have to find out
how good of a friend I really am.

30:48.805 --> 30:50.557
You're that rapist kid, aren't you?

30:52.559 --> 30:54.143
I thought I recognized you.

30:55.603 --> 30:58.106
That is some fucked-up shit you did.

30:58.940 --> 31:00.066
Yep, that's me.

31:00.775 --> 31:01.775
Fucked up.

31:02.610 --> 31:04.529
And my life is pretty fucked up, too.

31:05.780 --> 31:08.575
Which means I have no problem
dedicating whatever's left of it

31:08.658 --> 31:09.868
to ruining yours.

31:11.953 --> 31:12.953
So...

31:14.664 --> 31:15.707
what's it gonna be?

31:24.382 --> 31:26.050
<i>Can I ask you a question?</i>

31:28.887 --> 31:32.265
Are you just smoking it
or are you shooting it, too?

31:36.644 --> 31:39.439
- Yeah, both.
- Fuck! Justin...

31:40.315 --> 31:44.027
That shit will kill you dead. One shot
you get something that's too strong

31:44.360 --> 31:47.447
- or fucking fentanyl or some shit...
- What, are you gonna teach me now?

31:48.323 --> 31:50.658
No. No, of course not.

31:52.702 --> 31:54.245
But I don't want you to die.

32:19.896 --> 32:20.897
You take this shit?

32:21.564 --> 32:22.857
I don't, no.

32:23.733 --> 32:25.652
Makes me puke like a fire hose.

32:25.902 --> 32:28.863
- Fire hoses don't puke per se.
- Shut the fuck up.

32:29.781 --> 32:33.242
I got it when I twisted my ankle.
Take that shit instead, okay?

32:34.869 --> 32:36.329
Taper off it if you can.

32:37.330 --> 32:38.665
Don't fucking die.

32:43.878 --> 32:45.004
Bryce had my back.

32:46.255 --> 32:47.924
If it wasn't for him, Seth...

32:50.009 --> 32:51.636
He would've blown my brains out.

32:52.553 --> 32:54.138
Did you ever see him again?

32:54.555 --> 32:55.555
Bryce?

32:56.015 --> 32:57.475
It was just a one-time thing.

32:59.477 --> 33:01.896
I tried to avoid him
until the Homecoming game.

33:02.647 --> 33:03.648
Just, I couldn't...

33:05.149 --> 33:06.150
I couldn't face him.

33:08.111 --> 33:09.862
So, you have no idea how he died?

33:20.331 --> 33:21.331
Seth...

33:23.209 --> 33:26.004
sent me a text
on the day they found his body.

33:33.803 --> 33:34.803
Jesus.

33:36.514 --> 33:37.974
I didn't kill Bryce.

33:39.600 --> 33:42.270
But I think that
I might be the reason he is dead.

33:45.148 --> 33:47.483
So, you really believe
that Seth killed Bryce?

33:48.234 --> 33:49.736
I don't know. Maybe.

33:50.820 --> 33:53.114
It could be that he... he did.

33:55.283 --> 33:56.284
It could be that...

33:57.744 --> 33:59.662
we make the cops think that he did.

34:02.373 --> 34:04.125
Either way, I know where to start.

34:11.049 --> 34:14.052
- All right, we gotta be quick.
- Can we expect him back soon?

34:14.135 --> 34:17.054
I don't know, Ani.
He doesn't exactly keep banker's hours.

34:17.929 --> 34:19.264
Somebody's been shopping.

34:19.514 --> 34:21.809
Yeah, with Bryce's money,
I'm guessing.

34:23.268 --> 34:25.855
So, let's find proof.
Anything that links Seth to Bryce.

34:37.784 --> 34:39.659
Holy shit! Guys.

34:43.664 --> 34:44.916
This is Bryce's watch.

34:47.335 --> 34:48.835
Which means they met up again.

34:49.420 --> 34:52.632
Maybe Bryce gave it to him
when Seth came back for more.

34:53.257 --> 34:54.342
Or he took it.

34:55.092 --> 34:57.553
Off of Bryce's body after he killed him.

34:59.263 --> 35:01.432
- We have to go to the cops.
- We...

35:04.435 --> 35:06.187
What the fuck are you doing here?

35:07.021 --> 35:09.416
We know what you did to Bryce Walker.
We're calling the cops.

35:09.440 --> 35:11.734
- No, Clay, don't!
- The fuck you talking about?

35:11.818 --> 35:14.821
Justin told me how Bryce paid
you off so you'd leave him alone.

35:17.031 --> 35:18.950
- Oh, he did now?
- Clay, stop!

35:19.117 --> 35:20.868
And you went back to Bryce, right?

35:21.119 --> 35:23.663
For more money, but he refused
so you taught him a lesson.

35:25.623 --> 35:26.999
And what lesson was that?

35:28.835 --> 35:29.836
You killed him.

35:31.045 --> 35:33.756
- You don't know shit.
- Then why do you have his watch?

35:37.051 --> 35:38.469
Is that what you think?

35:38.553 --> 35:39.679
Shut the fuck up, Seth.

35:39.762 --> 35:42.306
I had no idea
the watch belonged to the dead kid.

35:42.598 --> 35:44.934
Junkie here gave it to me
for product.

35:46.561 --> 35:47.895
He's a fucking liar!

35:48.271 --> 35:49.856
You can live in a fancy house,

35:50.898 --> 35:52.608
but you're still a fucking junkie.

35:53.568 --> 35:55.778
- Just like your whore mama.
- Fuck you!

35:55.862 --> 35:57.256
- Justin!
- Get the fuck back.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.990
Whoa! Justin!

36:00.700 --> 36:01.701
Go! Go!

36:02.910 --> 36:03.995
Go!

36:05.037 --> 36:06.037
Fuck!

36:08.875 --> 36:11.961
So, Justin was the criminal
in the family,

36:12.795 --> 36:15.381
but Clay was the one
about to be accused of a crime.

36:16.299 --> 36:19.594
Legally, it should have no bearing
on the adoption proceedings,

36:19.677 --> 36:22.346
but Clay's over 18 now,

36:22.430 --> 36:26.142
and if any adult living in the household
has been convicted of a felony...

36:26.851 --> 36:28.436
the adoption will be denied.

36:28.519 --> 36:29.562
So, what do we do?

36:30.313 --> 36:31.355
For now, we wait.

36:32.064 --> 36:34.525
They won't recommend your case
to a judge until...

36:35.151 --> 36:38.571
until they have some clarity
on Clay's situation.

36:39.530 --> 36:40.530
Okay.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.032
Justin?

36:42.408 --> 36:44.785
You always have a home here,
no matter what.

36:45.870 --> 36:46.870
Okay?

36:47.371 --> 36:48.371
Yeah.

36:49.498 --> 36:50.498
Yeah, I know.

36:55.671 --> 36:56.881
You boys get some sleep.

37:10.853 --> 37:12.688
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

37:14.023 --> 37:16.442
For fucking what?
I mean, you didn't do anything.

37:17.026 --> 37:19.487
It's not your fault.
You have nothing to be sorry for.

37:20.655 --> 37:21.656
I love you, man.

37:25.243 --> 37:26.244
Yeah, me too.

37:29.163 --> 37:30.289
I have to take a shit.

37:39.674 --> 37:41.217
<i>When you live with an addict,</i>

37:41.842 --> 37:43.719
<i>everything starts looking suspicious.</i>

37:48.182 --> 37:52.061
<i>Like the one time Justin decides
to close the door to do his business.</i>

38:09.537 --> 38:10.537
Justin!

38:11.455 --> 38:13.141
- Shut the fucking door!
- What're you doing?

38:13.165 --> 38:14.667
What the fuck does it look like?

38:18.129 --> 38:21.382
You've been lying to me.
You've been getting high this whole time!

38:21.590 --> 38:22.590
No.

38:23.592 --> 38:25.720
No, I don't... I don't get high anymore.

38:25.803 --> 38:30.016
I get by. I maintain. I fucking...
I fucking survive!

38:30.433 --> 38:31.473
Seth was telling the truth

38:31.517 --> 38:33.769
- about the watch, wasn't he?
- I didn't kill Bryce!

38:33.936 --> 38:37.440
Then help me believe you!
Tell me how you ended up with his watch.

38:41.736 --> 38:42.778
No more lies!

38:48.159 --> 38:49.159
Okay.

38:52.872 --> 38:53.873
No more lies.

38:54.457 --> 38:56.459
<i>He told Clay
it was actually the watch</i>

38:56.542 --> 38:58.252
<i>he had taken the day of the funeral,</i>

38:59.628 --> 39:02.256
<i>but he had taken much more from Bryce
before that.</i>

39:05.801 --> 39:06.801
Justin!

39:07.678 --> 39:09.430
Dude. Justin, wake the fuck up!

39:09.513 --> 39:10.513
Come on, man!

39:11.140 --> 39:11.974
What the fuck?

39:12.058 --> 39:13.976
Dude, I've been waiting outside
for ten minutes.

39:14.643 --> 39:17.563
The team breakfast? It's game day.
Come on, dude. Let's go.

39:18.272 --> 39:19.272
Shit.

39:20.024 --> 39:21.817
Clean clothes, come on, let's go.
Is this...

39:22.902 --> 39:23.902
Is this clean?

39:25.654 --> 39:28.824
All right, everyone listen up.
Listen up in the back, all right?

39:29.325 --> 39:31.452
This is the start of league play
for the year.

39:31.577 --> 39:32.620
Yeah!

39:33.579 --> 39:37.041
Per state rules, players will be
drug tested at three random times.

39:38.084 --> 39:41.003
Tonight, gentlemen,
is one of those random times.

39:41.504 --> 39:43.506
So, when we get to the field house
for East County,

39:43.589 --> 39:45.549
we will go directly
into the visitor locker room,

39:45.633 --> 39:47.676
state guys will supervise the testing,
all right?

39:47.760 --> 39:49.512
Can we give sperm
instead of piss?

39:49.595 --> 39:52.014
'Cause I like to yank one off
before the game.

39:52.515 --> 39:54.058
Stay classy, Monty, all right?

39:54.558 --> 39:56.158
- Your captain's got a few words.
- Yeah!

39:56.936 --> 39:58.896
- Let's go!
- Yeah, get it.

39:58.979 --> 39:59.980
Boys,

40:00.439 --> 40:03.567
tonight, we show them
what kind of team we are,

40:03.651 --> 40:06.779
from the fucking piss test
to the real test out on the field.

40:06.862 --> 40:08.656
- Yes!
- Let's show them!

40:09.240 --> 40:11.784
I am so proud
of every single one of you!

40:11.867 --> 40:14.537
<i>The team had made Justin feel
like he belonged again.</i>

40:15.538 --> 40:16.664
Tigers!

40:17.415 --> 40:18.499
<i>Until that night.</i>

40:38.352 --> 40:39.770
- Yeah!
<i>- He watched Monty,</i>

40:40.312 --> 40:41.814
<i>Zach and Luke,</i>

40:41.981 --> 40:44.483
<i>how it all seemed so easy for them.</i>

40:44.900 --> 40:47.445

41:44.293 --> 41:46.378
<i>But on the field that night...</i>

42:12.613 --> 42:13.613
Damn it!

42:26.502 --> 42:29.463
Whatever you think is best.
Switch them if you want.

42:30.923 --> 42:32.633
Hey, Foley. Foley, what the hell?

42:32.716 --> 42:34.636
Taylor was gonna pick the guy up
over the middle.

42:34.718 --> 42:37.471
No, man coverage, dude.
That means cover your man!

42:37.555 --> 42:39.640
- Talk to fucking Taylor!
- Hey, don't you...

42:40.516 --> 42:42.268
- Don't you walk away from me.
- What?

42:43.102 --> 42:44.182
What do you want me to say?

42:44.228 --> 42:46.897
"I messed up, Coach."
That's what I want you to say.

42:47.022 --> 42:49.149
"I messed up,
I'll get it right next time."

42:49.233 --> 42:51.402
- Whatever.
- Okay, yeah. Whatever.

42:51.652 --> 42:53.964
Don't give me whatever.
"Whatever" is a piece of shit word.

42:53.988 --> 42:55.197
Don't be a piece of shit.

42:55.990 --> 42:56.990
Okay.

42:58.534 --> 42:59.577
Hey, hey.

43:00.452 --> 43:01.452
Justin.

43:01.495 --> 43:04.748
Justin, hey, look at me. Look at me.
Look, listen to me.

43:05.874 --> 43:06.959
Did you make a coverage

43:07.042 --> 43:08.252
- on that last down?
- No.

43:09.503 --> 43:10.503
No, sir.

43:11.255 --> 43:12.255
No, sir.

43:13.340 --> 43:14.550
That's all I want from you.

43:15.509 --> 43:19.263
- What, like an apology?
- No, no apology. Accountability.

43:20.639 --> 43:22.266
Look, we owe that to each other.

43:23.058 --> 43:24.810
We do our best. We fuck up, man.

43:25.978 --> 43:27.479
We get better and we learn.

43:28.480 --> 43:29.480
You get me?

43:32.026 --> 43:33.026
Yes, sir.

43:35.362 --> 43:36.362
Okay.

43:39.783 --> 43:40.784
<i>We fuck up.</i>

43:42.244 --> 43:43.245
<i>We get better.</i>

43:43.579 --> 43:45.080
<i>But sometimes it's not enough.</i>

43:45.831 --> 43:48.834
<i>Sometimes we fuck up again and again.</i>

43:49.877 --> 43:50.917
Hey, man. You good?

43:54.298 --> 43:55.549
I fucking suck tonight.

43:57.301 --> 43:58.469
Second half. Come back.

44:01.472 --> 44:02.472
Dude...

44:06.101 --> 44:07.101
I...

44:09.229 --> 44:11.106
I'm not gonna pass this drug test.

44:14.735 --> 44:17.071
- Man. Justin...
- I know.

44:19.281 --> 44:20.282
You were right, man.

44:21.700 --> 44:24.119
About playing again. It... It's been...

44:25.704 --> 44:27.247
I mean, it's been good for me.

44:28.791 --> 44:31.168
I'm just gonna fuck it up
because I fuck up everything.

44:35.130 --> 44:36.131
Man, I can't...

44:39.301 --> 44:40.302
I can't help you.

44:42.638 --> 44:43.639
I know. I...

44:45.474 --> 44:48.018
I just wanted you to be
the first person I told.

44:48.686 --> 44:50.688
Foley! Nickel!
Come on, get in there.

45:09.289 --> 45:10.791
- I got you.
- What?

45:10.958 --> 45:12.751
- I got you.
- How?

45:12.835 --> 45:13.836
I made a switch.

45:14.336 --> 45:16.296
- How'd you get around...
- Just shut the fuck up!

45:18.215 --> 45:19.466
You're clean, okay?

45:45.868 --> 45:46.868
Hey.

45:48.787 --> 45:51.039
I heard
you got your dicks fed to you tonight.

45:53.542 --> 45:54.585
Yeah, we sucked.

45:56.503 --> 45:58.422
You're not gonna get a win this year.

46:00.382 --> 46:01.550
Till we play Hillcrest.

46:03.010 --> 46:04.010
Yeah.

46:04.553 --> 46:05.596
Ah, shit.

46:29.703 --> 46:31.413
Fuck, man.

46:33.415 --> 46:36.126
How did we get like this, you and me?

46:42.716 --> 46:43.967
You raped my girlfriend.

He gave you the drugs
so he could control you.

48:13.098 --> 48:15.058
Same reason he ever gave you anything.

48:16.685 --> 48:18.270
No, this was different. He...

48:19.229 --> 48:20.229
was different.

48:20.772 --> 48:24.401
- He's a user, Justin. Always was.
- If anything, I was using him.

48:25.694 --> 48:26.904
But you didn't kill him?

48:28.113 --> 48:29.113
No.

No.

48:39.708 --> 48:40.709

48:50.636 --> 48:52.888
I needed to get fucked up, so I did.

48:54.556 --> 48:55.557
Where'd you go?

48:57.267 --> 48:58.310
Down by the docks.

49:00.479 --> 49:02.105

49:03.148 --> 49:04.816
How do I know I can believe you?

49:09.821 --> 49:11.490
Why did you go to Bryce for help?

49:13.408 --> 49:14.451
Instead of me?

49:15.827 --> 49:17.955
Come on, man.
You can figure that one out.

49:18.789 --> 49:20.874
You detoxed me once, remember?

49:21.959 --> 49:23.502
How do we get you clean now?

49:25.253 --> 49:27.673
We tell your parents.

49:28.632 --> 49:29.716
They send me away.

49:30.467 --> 49:31.301
They wouldn't.

49:31.385 --> 49:33.220
To a treatment center

49:33.303 --> 49:37.349
or a rehab, or some bullshit like that.
Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.

49:40.268 --> 49:41.269
Maybe I just...

49:42.771 --> 49:45.524
get the hell out of here
and spare everyone the trouble.

49:47.442 --> 49:50.278
You... you don't want to do that,
though, right?

49:54.074 --> 49:55.074
I really...

49:56.660 --> 49:57.660
really don't.

51:28.752 --> 51:32.005

51:38.804 --> 51:39.804
Yes.
