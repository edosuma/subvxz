00:08.602 --> 00:10.477
- Baby?
- Something's not right.

00:10.547 --> 00:12.006
We lost the third baby, Jack.

00:12.031 --> 00:13.237
I'm very sorry.

00:13.273 --> 00:17.577
I like to think that you took the
sourest lemon that life has to offer

00:17.602 --> 00:20.023
and turned it into something
resembling lemonade.

00:20.109 --> 00:24.672
36 years ago, my life started with you
leaving me on a fire station doorstep.

00:24.708 --> 00:26.791
Beth, The man has stage
IV stomach cancer.

00:26.826 --> 00:28.280
Why you watching this stuff?

00:28.305 --> 00:29.455
Told them to go screw themselves.

Some people think the scariest part is
coming to the hospital to have the baby.

02:20.679 --> 02:25.649
Nah. The scariest part
is leaving the hospital with the baby.

02:25.701 --> 02:28.719
Babies. Babies, of course.

02:28.754 --> 02:31.705
Doc, these two, they only fall asleep
if they're next to each other.

02:31.740 --> 02:33.540
Is that unusual?

02:33.576 --> 02:35.542
Well, they've been
sharing the same hot tub

02:35.544 --> 02:37.194
the last nine months; you can't

02:37.246 --> 02:38.729
No, I'm not concerned.

02:38.764 --> 02:41.448
Did she tell you what we named them?

02:41.483 --> 02:43.500
No, actually, she didn't.

02:43.535 --> 02:45.152
You can go ahead and tell him, babe.

02:45.187 --> 02:49.089
Kevin, Kate and Kyle.
All Ks.

02:49.124 --> 02:50.340
It's a good letter.

02:50.376 --> 02:53.977
We had a good doctor.
Right, Bec?

02:54.013 --> 02:57.798
I'm sorry.
I'm just, um, a little overwhelmed.

RANDALL: What are you guys doing here?

03:11.330 --> 03:14.097
We were on our way into the city
and thought we'd stop by and say hi.

03:14.133 --> 03:15.949
A friend at work gave us
his Hamilton tickets.

03:15.985 --> 03:17.718
Feel like I'm gonna be the one person

03:17.753 --> 03:20.187
on the planet who doesn't
like this damn thing.

03:20.222 --> 03:22.255
There's a man living with us. What?

03:22.291 --> 03:23.857
Daddy's friend from work.

03:23.859 --> 03:25.792

REBECCA (kissing): I missed you.

03:33.585 --> 03:35.552
This was not the plan.

03:35.587 --> 03:37.070
What plan?

03:37.106 --> 03:39.022
The plan for how I was gonna
tell her that I found him.

03:39.074 --> 03:40.340
I wasn't aware there was
a plan for that, babe.

03:40.342 --> 03:41.525
Well, there was.

03:41.560 --> 03:43.010
I mean, there was gonna be.

03:43.045 --> 03:45.679
The plan was forming, but now it's off.

03:45.714 --> 03:47.597
Okay, so what are you gonna do now?

03:47.650 --> 03:49.416
- Uh, right now?
- Mm-hmm.

03:49.468 --> 03:52.552
I'm gonna put on a fake-ass smile.

03:52.554 --> 03:55.355
I'm gonna ask to speak
to my mother privately.

03:55.357 --> 03:57.290
And then I'm gonna tell her something

03:57.326 --> 03:59.860
that's gonna completely and
utterly devastate her.

04:01.363 --> 04:03.146
Mommy?

04:03.182 --> 04:04.715
Can I talk to you privately?

04:04.750 --> 04:06.733
- One second.
- Sure.

- How's your face?

04:56.418 --> 04:58.802
(with mouth full): Well, it's fine.

04:58.837 --> 05:01.426
Luckily, I have all this
fat to soften the blow.

05:01.451 --> 05:02.289
Stop that.

05:02.324 --> 05:03.990
How's your breakfast?

05:04.026 --> 05:07.411
You mean this, uh, steel-cut oatmeal

05:07.446 --> 05:09.529
and egg white pancake
with no salt, no sugar,

05:09.581 --> 05:11.198
and no oil that you're making me eat?

05:11.200 --> 05:12.516
Yes.

05:12.551 --> 05:14.117
It's amazing.

05:14.153 --> 05:15.902
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

05:15.954 --> 05:18.371
It's the best thing I've ever tasted.

05:18.373 --> 05:19.606
(laughs)

05:19.608 --> 05:20.941
Quick question.

05:20.976 --> 05:24.027
Um, last night, after the party...

05:24.063 --> 05:25.595
I kind of blacked out.

05:25.631 --> 05:26.913
We didn't, uh...

05:26.949 --> 05:28.515
Oh, no.

05:28.517 --> 05:30.050
A lot of vomiting

05:30.085 --> 05:32.853
but not a lot of anything else.

05:32.888 --> 05:34.171
Oh. Sexy.

05:34.206 --> 05:36.890
You have an amazing voice, by the way.

05:36.925 --> 05:39.025
I did not know that you sang.

05:39.061 --> 05:41.294
Well, I did not know
that you spy on people

05:41.346 --> 05:42.529
in the bathroom.

05:42.581 --> 05:43.764
(chuckles)

05:43.766 --> 05:45.382
Will you sing for me?

05:45.417 --> 05:47.234
No.

05:47.286 --> 05:48.802
- Come on, Kate, come on.
- No.

05:48.804 --> 05:50.203
Come on, come on. You're good.

05:50.255 --> 05:51.938
And I'm not talking about karaoke-good.

05:51.940 --> 05:53.740
I'm talking good-good.

05:53.776 --> 05:54.958
(laughs)

05:54.993 --> 05:56.343
Have... did... you... did... (sighs)

05:56.378 --> 05:57.944
Did you ever perform?

05:57.946 --> 05:59.963
When I was really young.

05:59.998 --> 06:02.199
Cyndi Lauper was kind of my jam.

06:02.234 --> 06:03.433
Mm-hmm.

06:03.469 --> 06:06.119
"Time after Time" cover was...

06:06.155 --> 06:08.088
I rocked it. I was, you know...

06:08.090 --> 06:09.206
I rocked it like it was my job.

06:09.241 --> 06:11.525
- Mm-hmm.
- But then I grew up.

06:11.560 --> 06:13.126
And then I grew...

06:13.178 --> 06:15.862
and, um, you know,

06:15.898 --> 06:17.781
I try to avoid the spotlight.

06:17.816 --> 06:19.132
Are you done? Yes.

06:19.184 --> 06:20.417
Are you?

06:20.452 --> 06:23.069
(whispering): One more song.

06:23.105 --> 06:24.905
One more song.

06:24.957 --> 06:27.207
One more song. KEVIN: Okay, Kate,

06:27.242 --> 06:29.976
I am super pumped about
this move to New York City.

06:30.012 --> 06:31.311
I mean, we've got a ton to figure out,

06:31.346 --> 06:33.313
of course, but I'm super pumped.

06:33.315 --> 06:35.549
Wait... that was real?

06:35.601 --> 06:38.318
Yeah. Stage acting, it's my new jam.
Oh...

06:38.353 --> 06:40.403
Do you think you could get
that really cute, uh,

06:40.455 --> 06:42.389
that theater casting director,
the one who liked me. What's...

06:42.441 --> 06:44.090
- Cara.
- Cara, yes.

06:44.126 --> 06:45.358
I love Cara... Yeah.

06:45.410 --> 06:46.560
Oh, and when you get her on the phone,

06:46.595 --> 06:49.146
tell her I'm only interested
in doing heavy drama.

06:49.181 --> 06:50.630
We're not moving all the
way to New York City

06:50.632 --> 06:52.983
so I can do some lame
off-Broadway comedy.

06:53.018 --> 06:54.551
You want me to go with you?

06:54.586 --> 06:56.286
(laughs) Of course. Yeah.

06:56.321 --> 06:57.721
There's no way I could
do this without you.

06:57.773 --> 07:00.023
Oh, and maybe you should specify

07:00.058 --> 07:01.725
that I don't want to do anything
where I have to show my penis.

07:01.760 --> 07:03.160
Wow. Wow.

07:03.212 --> 07:04.694
Toby.

07:04.730 --> 07:06.763
- I didn't see you there, man. What's up?
- Hi.

07:06.798 --> 07:08.298
How's this? You know what we should do?

07:08.333 --> 07:09.633
We should look into the
meat-packing district.

07:09.668 --> 07:10.951
It's like an up and coming

07:10.986 --> 07:12.319
(mumbles with mouth full)

07:12.371 --> 07:14.538
Pancakes are good.

07:14.590 --> 07:15.906
(whispering): Is she
making you eat this?

07:15.941 --> 07:18.241
(quietly): I'm trying to have some sex.

07:20.345 --> 07:23.914
So now he's been here for about a week.

07:23.949 --> 07:26.399
I guess I just wanted to get
used to the idea of him myself,

07:26.435 --> 07:30.370
you know, before I told you,
and this has nothing to do

07:30.422 --> 07:31.955
with you or Dad... I
hope you know that.

07:31.990 --> 07:34.241
- I do know that, yes, of course.
- Okay, okay.

07:34.243 --> 07:35.775
I mean, obviously, I've
been curious about him

07:35.811 --> 07:38.094
since I was a kid.

07:38.130 --> 07:40.947
And I know you guys would have
found him if you could have.

07:44.386 --> 07:45.952
So who is he?

07:45.954 --> 07:47.520
What did he tell you about himself?

07:47.522 --> 07:48.838
(chuckling): Uh...

07:48.891 --> 07:50.507
His name is William.

07:51.526 --> 07:53.093
That's it?

07:53.128 --> 07:54.527
- He didn't tell you anything else?
- (laughing)

07:54.580 --> 07:57.297
Uh, he has a cat.

07:57.332 --> 07:58.732
Stomach cancer.

08:00.702 --> 08:02.625
It's the basic gist of
what I know so far.

08:02.651 --> 08:03.544
(quietly): Wow.

08:05.657 --> 08:07.357
(sighs)

08:08.860 --> 08:11.177
(inhales) Well, where is he?

08:11.179 --> 08:12.796
I'd like to, uh, meet him.

08:12.831 --> 08:14.581
- He's in Annie's room, but...
- Okay.

08:14.616 --> 08:16.917
I don't know if he's
ready for company, Ma.

08:16.952 --> 08:18.768
Hold on one second.

08:30.249 --> 08:32.414
- (traffic and street sounds)
- JACK: Okay.

08:32.451 --> 08:34.467
Okay.

08:34.503 --> 08:35.552
Car seats are installed.

08:35.587 --> 08:37.037
Policeman approved.

08:37.072 --> 08:38.688
I'll pull up, we'll load up.

08:38.724 --> 08:40.073
And then the adventure begins, yeah?

08:40.107 --> 08:41.607
Okay.

08:41.643 --> 08:44.444
If I were you, I would
head right to Mexico.

08:44.479 --> 08:46.279
If I don't come back, at least
you'll know where to find me.

08:46.315 --> 08:47.597
(laughs) Oh...

08:50.202 --> 08:52.736
(sighs)

09:00.095 --> 09:01.761
Hey!

09:08.203 --> 09:09.719
Wait.

09:12.107 --> 09:13.556
Okay, let's lock and load.

09:13.592 --> 09:15.542
- Here, I got him.
- Yeah.

09:15.577 --> 09:16.893
(groaning): Oh. Come on, big boy.

09:16.928 --> 09:18.428
Okay.

09:21.016 --> 09:23.483
(knocks on door)

09:24.820 --> 09:25.835
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:25.871 --> 09:27.904
- I wanted to introdu...
- Hi.

09:27.939 --> 09:29.823
I'm Rebecca, I'm Randall's mother.

09:29.858 --> 09:32.192
Very nice to meet you.

09:32.227 --> 09:34.995
Uh, nice to meet you, as well.

09:35.030 --> 09:37.630
(chuckles)

09:37.666 --> 09:42.602
Sweetheart, could you give
us just a moment to chat?

09:42.637 --> 09:44.888
Uh... yeah.

09:44.923 --> 09:46.406
Thank you.

09:53.415 --> 09:55.815
You look well.

10:02.075 --> 10:04.876

10:26.399 --> 10:29.033
REBECCA: Can you please check on Kevin?

10:29.068 --> 10:30.284
♪ Send out for whiskey, baby ♪

10:30.319 --> 10:31.886
Why, why won't he stop crying?

10:34.473 --> 10:35.822
They'll be in college soon.

10:35.858 --> 10:38.608
- Ha.
- (baby crying)

10:38.660 --> 10:41.995
(sighs) Which one?

10:41.997 --> 10:44.197
Probably the one that hates me.

10:44.233 --> 10:46.133
He doesn't hate you. Jack, I think

10:46.185 --> 10:47.968
we're gonna have to
start him on formula.

10:48.020 --> 10:49.803
No. He's fine.

10:49.805 --> 10:51.338
He won't take to my breast.

10:51.340 --> 10:53.540
We have to treat them the same.

10:53.575 --> 10:54.808
He's not the same.

10:54.860 --> 10:56.626
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10:56.678 --> 10:58.445
He's just... He's not.
I grew the other two

10:58.447 --> 11:01.548
inside of me, and he
feels like a stranger.

11:01.583 --> 11:04.117
And I feel really terrible
for saying that out loud,

11:04.153 --> 11:06.336
but he just... he does.

11:06.372 --> 11:08.071
(sighs)

11:08.107 --> 11:10.257
(crying stops)

11:11.260 --> 11:13.994
(sighs)

11:13.996 --> 11:16.129
Jack,

11:16.131 --> 11:17.998
when we were leaving the hospital...

11:18.033 --> 11:19.733
I know. You were having

11:19.768 --> 11:22.269
second thoughts about bringing him home.
It's fine.

11:22.304 --> 11:25.238
- No. No, it's not that. I...
- It's natural.

11:25.290 --> 11:29.559
He's fine, Bec.

11:29.595 --> 11:31.261
He's fine.

11:33.015 --> 11:34.364
Look at us.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.049
(sighs)

11:36.051 --> 11:38.602
I mean, I was a complete stranger.

11:38.637 --> 11:40.720
Look how quickly I took to your breast.

11:40.756 --> 11:42.406
- You're an idiot.
- Yeah.

11:42.441 --> 11:43.874
I'm your idiot.

11:43.909 --> 11:45.792
Okay?

11:45.828 --> 11:48.745
And they are our babies.

11:48.781 --> 11:51.715
He's our baby.

11:51.750 --> 11:54.201
Okay?

11:54.236 --> 11:57.204
(baby crying)

11:57.206 --> 11:59.322
They'll be in college soon?

11:59.358 --> 12:02.626
Any day now.

12:02.661 --> 12:05.595
And then she just asked
to speak to him alone.

12:05.631 --> 12:08.098
- About what?
- I don't know.

12:08.133 --> 12:11.251
Whatever biological fathers and
adopted mothers talk about.

12:11.253 --> 12:11.991
What is that?

12:12.016 --> 12:14.204
The Knicks, Beth. How the
hell am I supposed to know?

12:14.239 --> 12:16.223
I...

12:18.210 --> 12:22.162
You love me so much that you're
just gonna give me that one?

12:22.197 --> 12:26.817
Mm-hmm. You know me so well, my friend.

12:26.852 --> 12:28.835
I got to take him to that
doctor's appointment

12:28.871 --> 12:30.637
in two hours.

12:30.672 --> 12:32.806
God. What the hell do you think

12:32.841 --> 12:34.774
- they're talking about, anyway?
- I don't know, honey.

12:34.810 --> 12:36.626
(sighs)

12:36.678 --> 12:37.994
He found me.

12:38.030 --> 12:39.896
- He brought me here.
- But you stayed.

12:39.932 --> 12:41.798
- Yes, I stayed.
- Hmm.

12:41.834 --> 12:44.050
We had a deal.

12:44.086 --> 12:46.436
I won't tell him, if that's
what you're thinking.

12:46.472 --> 12:48.472
(sobs)

12:48.507 --> 12:52.375
Oh, God. All those... (sighs)

12:53.412 --> 12:55.779
It will break him.

12:55.814 --> 12:59.082
It will. Knowing that
he could've known you

12:59.117 --> 13:01.234
and that I kept him from that.

13:01.270 --> 13:03.787
Rebecca, the deal we
made was the right one.

13:03.822 --> 13:05.388
For everyone.

13:06.479 --> 13:09.581
- If you hurt him...
- I won't.

13:13.165 --> 13:15.765
Fine, then.

13:15.801 --> 13:19.252
But know this:

13:19.288 --> 13:22.038
my son,

13:22.074 --> 13:24.858
who I raised,

13:24.893 --> 13:29.196
is gonna put everything he
has into trying to save you,

13:29.248 --> 13:31.448
because that's who he is.

13:31.483 --> 13:33.783
It's gonna come in front of his job,

13:33.819 --> 13:35.769
in front of his marriage,

13:35.804 --> 13:39.272
and in front of his time with his kids.

13:41.326 --> 13:44.945
So you better damn well be worth that.

13:47.749 --> 13:50.100
(sniffling)

13:53.238 --> 13:55.055
(sighs)

13:55.057 --> 13:57.040
Damn it.

13:58.043 --> 14:00.427
Damn it.

14:00.429 --> 14:03.096
Yes, um, it would be for
an open-ended reservation,

14:03.148 --> 14:05.899
until we can find him a rental.

14:05.934 --> 14:09.436
And your pillows are
hypoallergenic, yeah?

14:09.438 --> 14:12.739
And can I just confirm that the
hotel gym's not just, like,

14:12.774 --> 14:14.941
three crappy elliptical machines?

14:14.977 --> 14:17.377
'Cause he needs space for
floor work and exercise

14:17.429 --> 14:19.112
and free weight... Great.

14:19.164 --> 14:21.431
You know, actually, can I just
have pictures sent to me?

14:21.466 --> 14:23.450
Hey, babe.

14:23.485 --> 14:25.335
Have you seen my keys?

14:25.370 --> 14:28.004
I think you left 'em in
the plan you never made.

14:28.040 --> 14:32.492
(chuckles) So she's funny, too.
That's good. My keys.

14:32.544 --> 14:33.727
So?

14:33.762 --> 14:36.129
He seems very nice.

14:36.181 --> 14:38.281
MIKE: Honey,

14:38.333 --> 14:39.382
we should get going if
we're gonna get dinner

14:39.418 --> 14:40.900
- in the city first.
- Oh.

14:40.936 --> 14:42.469
- I bet the tunnel's gonna be jammed.
- Okay.

14:42.504 --> 14:43.787
No, stay!

14:43.822 --> 14:45.605
- Oh...
- Dad's work friend doesn't eat a lot.

14:45.641 --> 14:47.424
- You can have some of his dinner.
- (chuckling): What?

14:47.459 --> 14:50.810
Uh, Grandma and Grandpa
can't stay, girls.

14:50.846 --> 14:52.162
- Aw...
- And, anyway, I've got

14:52.214 --> 14:55.682
an appointment with my
work friend, so, um...

14:55.717 --> 14:56.916
I promise to catch up

14:56.952 --> 14:58.568
- with you about all this.
- Mm-hmm.

14:58.604 --> 15:00.303
- Promise? Mm-hmm.
- Miguel,

15:00.339 --> 15:03.490
thanks for dropping by unexpectedly.
Ha-ha-ha.

15:03.542 --> 15:06.543
(mimics VCR) Rewind.
Thanks for dropping by.

15:06.595 --> 15:09.863
Always love it. Always love you guys.
Peace.

15:12.551 --> 15:14.651
He's hiding something.

15:16.488 --> 15:19.155
Hey. We got to get goin'.

15:21.977 --> 15:24.644
William?

15:25.764 --> 15:28.415
Hey.

15:28.450 --> 15:30.984
William. Where you goin'?

15:31.019 --> 15:33.119
Home. Why? What happened?

15:33.155 --> 15:34.954
- We got the doctor's appointment.
- You should cancel.

15:34.990 --> 15:37.791
Why would I cancel... W-Will
you get in the damn car?

15:37.826 --> 15:39.492
I knew if I told you I was
leaving, you'd try and stop me

15:39.528 --> 15:42.245
like you are right now.

15:42.297 --> 15:45.231
You'd try and stop me 'cause you
were raised to be a good man.

15:45.267 --> 15:47.917
But I wasn't the one who
raised you that way, Randall.

15:47.953 --> 15:49.686
I was reminded of that today.

15:49.738 --> 15:51.554
That you have parents.

15:51.590 --> 15:53.790
That I just can't step
in 40 years later

15:53.825 --> 15:55.709
and enjoy the fruits of
someone else's labor.

15:55.744 --> 15:57.510
So, just like that, you go?

15:57.546 --> 15:59.279
- No good-bye to the girls?
- The girls

15:59.331 --> 16:00.480
- will be fine.
- No, they'll be devastated.

16:00.515 --> 16:01.531
They don't even know

16:01.566 --> 16:02.816
who I am.

16:02.851 --> 16:04.751
- Look, this doctor...
- He isn't gonna

16:04.786 --> 16:06.219
tell me anything I don't already know.

16:06.271 --> 16:07.537
- But he might.
- He won't.

16:07.589 --> 16:09.189
But he might.

16:11.993 --> 16:14.361
And something tells me he might
be a little more thorough

16:14.396 --> 16:16.296
than the doctor at whatever
free homeless clinic

16:16.348 --> 16:18.498
you've been going to to get
your free medical counsel at.

16:18.533 --> 16:20.650
To say nothing of the fact
that I had to kiss up

16:20.686 --> 16:22.402
to the biggest D-bag at my firm

16:22.437 --> 16:23.703
just to get you this appointment.

16:23.739 --> 16:25.021
So, yes, William,

16:25.057 --> 16:27.657
you are getting in the car right now,

16:27.693 --> 16:29.976
and we are going to this
doctor's appointment.

16:30.011 --> 16:32.829
And then and only then
will I give you permission

16:32.881 --> 16:35.048
to hobble off like Hobo
Joe without saying

16:35.083 --> 16:37.667
so much as a good-bye.

16:40.655 --> 16:42.539
Startin' to not feel so bad

16:42.574 --> 16:45.358
about leaving you at that fire station.

16:45.394 --> 16:46.960
Yeah, whatever.

Swift? Is it true that you just broke up

with Taylor Swift just now?

- Well,

18:22.446 --> 18:23.979
no more background singing for you.

We are on our way to

18:35.576 --> 18:37.976
an instrumental copy
of "Time after Time,"

18:38.012 --> 18:39.594
found an old boom box.

All right.

19:00.117 --> 19:02.451
Okay, so,

19:02.486 --> 19:04.753
my Aunt Dolly actually lives here.

19:04.788 --> 19:06.855
All right, I booked you in
their prime slot, 3:00 p.m.

And most of them

19:15.899 --> 19:18.667

19:58.308 --> 20:01.510
I mean, I only ask because
it's a little unusual

20:01.512 --> 20:03.979
for the father to be here alone.

20:04.014 --> 20:07.132
She just needed a little break,

you know?

20:08.369 --> 20:10.452
She's... she's...

20:10.487 --> 20:13.321
she's not totally herself.

20:13.323 --> 20:16.708
I mean, she's a...

20:16.744 --> 20:18.076
little dazed,

20:18.112 --> 20:21.329
I guess? She's not
bonding with the babies.

20:21.382 --> 20:23.115
And not with Kyle, mainly.

20:23.150 --> 20:25.667
You know? Not with Kyle.

20:25.702 --> 20:29.304
I think she might be a little broken.

20:29.338 --> 20:33.274
You know, I-I think the babies
might have broken my wife.

20:33.310 --> 20:35.410
You can fix her, right?

20:35.446 --> 20:37.312

I was... I was hoping you could tell me

20:38.949 --> 20:40.348
- how to fix her.
- Sit down, Jack.

20:55.632 --> 20:58.366
She lost a baby, Jack.

20:58.402 --> 21:00.869
You can't just dismiss that.

21:00.871 --> 21:03.672
- So did I.
- Yeah.

21:03.674 --> 21:08.226
And you took your grief, and you...
channeled it into action.

21:08.278 --> 21:11.446
You willed yourself
forward with positivity,

21:11.448 --> 21:14.332
but Rebecca has just...

21:14.384 --> 21:16.468
She's gonna have to do
this in her own way,

21:16.520 --> 21:19.171
and you're just gonna have to
give her the space to do it.

21:19.206 --> 21:21.923
Yeah. What if she doesn't find her way?

21:21.925 --> 21:23.458
She will. How do you know?

21:23.494 --> 21:25.193
For the same reason that I know

21:25.229 --> 21:27.446
you're gonna give her
the space to find it.

21:27.481 --> 21:30.599
'Cause I believe in good people.

21:31.835 --> 21:33.969
Of course, I voted for Nixon,

21:34.021 --> 21:37.105
so you got to take everything
I say with a grain of salt.

21:37.157 --> 21:38.673
(laughs)

21:38.675 --> 21:41.076
Now, look, there's a couch
in there in my office.

21:41.128 --> 21:43.278
Why don't you go lie down, take a nap?

21:43.313 --> 21:45.280
I'm-I'm totally free
the rest of the day.

21:45.282 --> 21:47.315
I can use the time with my namesakes.

21:47.351 --> 21:49.851
(laughs) No, there's three.
You don't... you don't...

21:49.887 --> 21:51.636
I brought them into the world, Jack.

21:51.688 --> 21:54.589
I am perfectly qualified to
sit here and watch 'em sleep

21:54.625 --> 21:56.591
and crap themselves for
a couple of hours.

21:56.643 --> 21:58.493
Now go. Now.

22:13.443 --> 22:17.646
(bus brakes squeak, doors whoosh open)

22:17.648 --> 22:19.514
Hi. Sorry to bother you.

22:19.550 --> 22:21.333
I'm looking for someone. Um,

22:21.368 --> 22:24.920
he's Afro-American, very, very thin.

22:24.955 --> 22:26.938
Possibly on drugs.

22:26.974 --> 22:28.540
(scoffs)

22:28.592 --> 22:30.275
You know what? I sound ridiculous.

22:30.327 --> 22:31.760
Sorry. I sound so stupid.

22:31.812 --> 22:35.564
You mean Shakespeare?
You looking for him?

22:35.599 --> 22:37.332
Come on, get in.

22:46.067 --> 22:48.569
- (feedback squeals)
- TOBY: All right. Uh, good afternoon,

22:48.604 --> 22:51.755
ladies and germs. Uh, my name is Toby.

22:52.089 --> 22:53.972
I'm actually, uh,

22:53.974 --> 22:55.340
Dolly's nephew.

22:55.375 --> 22:56.875
Everybody knows Aunt Dolly, right?

22:56.910 --> 23:00.128
Wave for everybody, Dolly.
Hello, Dolly!

23:00.163 --> 23:02.097
Be careful, gentlemen.
She's a real man-eater.

23:02.132 --> 23:03.715
Aren't you, Dolly?

23:03.750 --> 23:06.367
(laughs) Okay. Okay,
well, we have a very

23:06.403 --> 23:08.186
special treat for you this afternoon.

23:08.188 --> 23:10.672
The lady that I am about to introduce

23:10.724 --> 23:13.141
has been called the next Bette Midler.

23:13.193 --> 23:17.112
Adele admires her, Streisand
considers her a friend,

23:17.147 --> 23:20.465
J.Lo wishes she had that ass.

23:20.500 --> 23:24.235
Ladies and gentlemen,
performing for one song only,

23:24.271 --> 23:26.654
I give you... Kate! Oh!

23:26.690 --> 23:28.957
(applause)

23:28.992 --> 23:30.325
Oh, yeah.

23:30.377 --> 23:31.810
All right, here we go.

23:31.812 --> 23:33.261
That's for you.

23:33.296 --> 23:34.646
- Really? You want me to...?
- Yup.

23:34.681 --> 23:37.182
(sighs) Okay.

23:37.184 --> 23:40.485
(guitar plays slow, gentle
intro to "Time after Time")

23:40.487 --> 23:42.937
Hi.

23:42.973 --> 23:45.523

25:58.484 --> 26:01.168
(moaning)

26:01.203 --> 26:03.603
Oh. Oh, if I had known.

26:03.639 --> 26:06.223
(moaning): I would have... I would have

26:06.258 --> 26:07.824
taken you to the nursing
home for every date.

26:07.860 --> 26:09.209
Shut up. Okay.

26:09.244 --> 26:11.211
- (moans, phone plays tune)
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

26:11.246 --> 26:13.046
Uh-uh. No. No, no, just shut it off.

26:13.048 --> 26:14.781
- Crap.
- Just shut it off!

26:14.783 --> 26:15.916
What?

26:15.951 --> 26:17.317
ELAINE: Oh, my sister was

26:17.353 --> 26:18.719
so right about... Elaine's here.

26:18.754 --> 26:20.203
She's trashing the joint, I'm locked

26:20.239 --> 26:22.556
- in the closet.
- Insane Elaine? Why is she there?

26:22.558 --> 26:24.057
- (indistinct yelling, clattering)
- I called her.

26:24.059 --> 26:25.442
How?

26:25.494 --> 26:27.260
I deleted her number
from your contacts.

26:27.262 --> 26:29.730
I found it in the Cloud.

26:29.765 --> 26:31.882
- You called Insane Elaine?
- (glass breaking through phone)

26:31.934 --> 26:33.433
And I had sex with her.

26:33.469 --> 26:35.669
And I told her I was
moving to New York,

26:35.704 --> 26:36.608
and then she went crazy.

26:36.633 --> 26:38.905
I am not crazy! Why does
everyone call me crazy?! Why?!

26:38.907 --> 26:39.361
(clattering)

26:39.386 --> 26:40.748
You know what? Um, I got
a little overwhelmed

26:40.776 --> 26:43.160
with the move, you know, I tried
calling you, but you're not

26:43.195 --> 26:45.395
- picking up. Oh, God.
- (glass breaking)

26:45.431 --> 26:47.798
You know what? She's breaking
things again. Get over here.

26:47.833 --> 26:50.183
I will be right over.

26:50.219 --> 26:52.052
(phone beeps off)

26:52.087 --> 26:53.570
I am...

26:53.605 --> 26:54.893
I'm sorry. I have to go.

26:54.956 --> 26:56.672
Oh, but really, you don't,

26:56.708 --> 26:58.391
and it's kind of crazy that
you think that you do.

26:59.105 --> 27:00.705
Toby, you don't get it.

27:00.730 --> 27:01.677
We're-we're twins. We're
not like regular people.

27:01.702 --> 27:04.209
When I was a kid, broke my arm

27:04.234 --> 27:06.545
and he cried out in pain
ten miles away, right?

27:06.570 --> 27:07.467
We're that connected.

27:07.491 --> 27:09.607
I thought we were, too, is the thing.

27:09.643 --> 27:13.361
Kate, I'm not some nut job
who performs grand gestures

27:13.363 --> 27:17.282
for every girl that I
go on a few dates with.

27:17.574 --> 27:21.709
I like you, Kate. I like you a lot.

27:22.223 --> 27:25.057
But I can't... I can't play
second banana to your brother.

27:25.592 --> 27:28.309
You have to.

27:28.311 --> 27:30.945
Everyone has to.

27:32.199 --> 27:34.015
(door opens)

27:34.017 --> 27:35.383
(door closes)

27:35.832 --> 27:37.249
Great.

27:37.809 --> 27:40.159
Have a good time in New York!

27:41.275 --> 27:43.293
DOCTOR: William, will
you join me out here?

27:44.947 --> 27:46.735
William.

27:46.760 --> 27:50.134
Randall. I wish I had better news.

27:50.192 --> 27:52.993
The cancer has metastasized

27:53.028 --> 27:55.863
to a point where there's
really not much we can do.

27:56.681 --> 27:59.115
There are some experimental treatments.
Frankly,

27:59.150 --> 28:01.067
they haven't been very promising.

28:01.102 --> 28:04.587
I'm very, very sorry.

28:04.639 --> 28:07.056
(knocking)

28:10.528 --> 28:12.094
Um...

28:16.751 --> 28:20.236
WILLIAM: I'm not very well,
as you can probably tell.

28:22.572 --> 28:24.922
The baby didn't come from this.

28:24.957 --> 28:26.740
It came from love.

28:26.776 --> 28:28.659
His mother?

28:28.661 --> 28:34.014
You know, we-we... we met
on that bus, actually.

28:34.066 --> 28:38.335
My world spun on every axis that day.

28:40.650 --> 28:43.868
I read poetry to her the
first time we talked.

28:43.903 --> 28:45.887
Uh, not any of mine.

28:45.939 --> 28:47.605
I was too shy for that.

28:47.607 --> 28:50.007
One of my

28:50.009 --> 28:52.443
favorite poets, and...

28:55.215 --> 28:57.899
She used to love it when I read to her.

28:59.319 --> 29:03.771
So what'd you name the baby?

29:03.823 --> 29:06.124
Kyle.

29:06.159 --> 29:09.010
I was having triplets, and, um,

29:09.045 --> 29:11.929
on a whim, actually, we
just decided to name them.

29:11.965 --> 29:14.732
Kevin, Kate and Kyle.

29:18.488 --> 29:23.274
I... I lost one of the
babies during delivery,

29:23.309 --> 29:25.576
but your baby showed up

29:25.612 --> 29:27.545
at the hospital the very same morning.

29:27.580 --> 29:29.897
It felt like destiny.

29:37.357 --> 29:40.608
Um... I just...

29:40.660 --> 29:42.727
I appreciate this. I-I, um...

29:42.762 --> 29:45.146
I wanted to know his story.

29:46.766 --> 29:49.350
And that there was good here, so...

29:49.402 --> 29:53.221
I wonder if I could check on him

29:53.273 --> 29:55.439
from time to time.

29:55.492 --> 29:58.576
No. No.

30:00.814 --> 30:03.447
I-I also need to know...

30:03.449 --> 30:06.284
I need to know that you're
not gonna come back for him.

30:06.319 --> 30:10.204
I need to know that I can move forward.

30:10.256 --> 30:13.875
Because he will have your blood

30:13.910 --> 30:16.794
and the blanket you wrapped
him up in, but that's it.

30:16.796 --> 30:18.196
That's the deal. Otherwise, I...

30:18.198 --> 30:19.964
I understand.

30:19.999 --> 30:22.316
Okay.

30:32.846 --> 30:34.595
I'm not...

30:34.647 --> 30:36.414
(sighs)

30:36.416 --> 30:38.149
I'm not bonding with the baby.

30:38.184 --> 30:42.186
(crying): I want to love
him like he's my own,

30:42.222 --> 30:46.357
but every time I look at his face...

30:46.392 --> 30:47.875
(sighs heavily)

30:47.911 --> 30:50.311
(cries)

30:51.497 --> 30:54.465
Give him his own name.

31:00.940 --> 31:04.876
What was the name of the, uh,
poet you used to read to her?

31:04.911 --> 31:06.911
Your favorite poet.

31:18.825 --> 31:21.792
Maybe you'll see fit to
give it to him someday.

31:29.619 --> 31:32.536
Thank you.

31:36.092 --> 31:37.808
(door closes)

31:48.705 --> 31:51.305
BETH: Hey.

31:51.341 --> 31:52.873
Hey.

31:52.909 --> 31:54.375
How'd it go?

31:54.410 --> 31:55.843
It's bad.

31:55.878 --> 31:59.497
Nothing to be done, really.

31:59.499 --> 32:01.215
Some experimental treatments

32:01.251 --> 32:03.985
that'll give him a few more months.

32:04.020 --> 32:06.554
He's upstairs resting.

32:06.589 --> 32:10.207
Peacefully with his arms crossed
over his chest, no doubt.

32:10.209 --> 32:11.859
I have no idea how I
came from that man.

32:11.911 --> 32:13.728
I'm so sorry, babe.

32:13.763 --> 32:15.630
Yeah, I don't know what I expected.

32:15.665 --> 32:17.465
Yes, I do.

32:17.517 --> 32:20.055
I expected to find a father
who wasn't so damn sick.

32:20.080 --> 32:20.901
Randall...

32:20.937 --> 32:23.621
I should have looked for
him years ago, Beth.

32:23.656 --> 32:26.340
I mean, the girls could have had
a grandfather all this time.

32:26.376 --> 32:28.676
Instead, I brought him
here so they could what?

32:28.728 --> 32:30.895
Fall in love with a dying man.

32:30.947 --> 32:33.864
So, this is about the girls, then?

32:33.866 --> 32:35.599
Hmm?

32:35.601 --> 32:38.919
You don't want them to
fall in love with him?

32:41.824 --> 32:44.008
He's been here a week, baby.

32:44.060 --> 32:45.893
And you don't know any more about him

32:45.928 --> 32:48.646
then you did the first time
he walked through that door.

32:50.366 --> 32:53.234
I don't know what you were
looking for with all this,

32:53.286 --> 32:57.688
or even if you do, but I do know

32:57.690 --> 33:00.624
you don't have a whole lot of time.

33:33.593 --> 33:36.427
Is she gone? Yeah.

33:36.479 --> 33:37.812
Oh.

33:37.847 --> 33:39.914
God, I hope the booty
call was worth it.

33:39.949 --> 33:41.215
It was.

33:42.785 --> 33:45.369
I just started to get
overwhelmed, you know?

33:45.405 --> 33:47.671
Started reading one of
those plays you gave me.

33:47.707 --> 33:49.457
You actually read one?

33:49.509 --> 33:51.175
I read them all, actually.

33:51.210 --> 33:53.511
But, uh, this one, though,
it's really good, you know?

33:53.546 --> 33:55.096
Like, really good.

33:55.131 --> 33:57.615
And I just started to get
a little overwhelmed

33:57.617 --> 33:59.433
'cause I felt like, um,

33:59.469 --> 34:01.736
I felt like maybe it
was too good for me.

34:01.788 --> 34:03.020
It's not, Kevin.

34:03.056 --> 34:04.922
It's not... they would be lucky.

34:06.592 --> 34:08.324
Well...

34:12.197 --> 34:16.083
So my guy turned out to be
more insane than Elaine.

34:16.135 --> 34:18.202
Toby? Get this.

34:18.237 --> 34:20.771
So he takes me to a nursing home...

34:20.822 --> 34:22.556
to sing in front of old people.

34:22.592 --> 34:24.091
Mm-hmm.

34:24.127 --> 34:26.377
So I'd be a star but in a
comfortable environment,

34:26.379 --> 34:28.279
'cause otherwise I would freak out.

34:28.281 --> 34:29.780
It was the whole works.

34:29.782 --> 34:31.837
He had the red carpet,
he had the car, suit.

34:31.862 --> 34:34.668
- It was like...
- Oh, that's good.

34:34.704 --> 34:37.004
Yeah. And then afterwards,

34:37.056 --> 34:39.239
like, I was on a high, like,

34:39.292 --> 34:43.244
I know it sounds stupid,
but I, I felt so free.

34:43.279 --> 34:44.844
Then what happened?

34:44.897 --> 34:46.897
Well, you called.

34:46.899 --> 34:49.300
Told him I had to go and
he got pouty and mean.

34:49.302 --> 34:50.801
Wait a minute, I called
at that very moment

34:50.803 --> 34:51.936
and you actually answered the phone?

34:51.971 --> 34:54.004
Of course I answered.

34:56.626 --> 34:59.326
Anyway, I need to focus
on losing weight

34:59.362 --> 35:00.928
and our big move to New York,

35:00.980 --> 35:03.514
and I don't even need to
be in a relationship.

35:06.185 --> 35:07.718
You're fired.

35:08.871 --> 35:10.421
What?

35:10.456 --> 35:13.190
Yeah, Kate, you're fired.

35:13.242 --> 35:14.842
Why?

35:16.779 --> 35:20.581
You're the personal assistant
to your brother, all right?

35:20.616 --> 35:24.001
A brother who locks himself
in his master bedroom closet.

35:24.003 --> 35:25.886
A master bedroom closet

35:25.938 --> 35:27.571
that happens to have a mini-bar in it.

35:27.607 --> 35:31.575
Maybe it's time we go at it
alone for a while, you know?

35:31.577 --> 35:34.011
Just for a little while
to see what happens.

35:34.046 --> 35:36.897
You know, maybe we
need to grow up a bit.

35:44.824 --> 35:49.260
I don't really know who I
am if I'm not your sister.

35:52.348 --> 35:54.698
I do.

35:56.302 --> 35:58.219
You're gonna love her.

35:58.254 --> 36:01.555
(laughs)

36:05.300 --> 36:07.383
I don't like it when you're sweet.

36:17.684 --> 36:19.385
Okay, I'm here. What?

36:20.922 --> 36:22.238
I'm sorry.

36:22.379 --> 36:24.395
Yeah, well, sorry doesn't
change the fact...

36:24.431 --> 36:26.331
What you did for me today
was the nicest thing

36:26.366 --> 36:28.867
- that anyone has ever done for me.
- Okay, but that still doesn't...

36:28.902 --> 36:31.069
And I'm not moving to New York.

36:31.104 --> 36:32.670
- Okay, but that still doesn't change...
- I got you something.

36:32.722 --> 36:34.873
I accept your apology.

36:34.908 --> 36:37.459
Yeah? Yes.

36:37.511 --> 36:38.726
(phone rings)

36:38.762 --> 36:39.994
Don't you dare answer that.

36:40.030 --> 36:41.229
I'm not.

36:41.264 --> 36:42.897
- Do not.
- I won't.

36:42.933 --> 36:44.074
KATE: Leave a message for Kate.

36:44.176 --> 36:45.552
KEVIN: Oh, Kate, good.
You didn't answer.

36:45.587 --> 36:48.155
Hopefully, that means
you're having sex.

36:48.207 --> 36:49.856
Anyway, I did it.

36:49.892 --> 36:51.591
I-I booked a red-eye to New York.

36:51.627 --> 36:53.777
I'm just gonna do it,
'cause, you know...

36:53.829 --> 36:54.961
Kate, if we keep talking about it,

36:54.997 --> 36:56.062
we'll talk ourselves out of it.

36:56.098 --> 36:57.280
I'll never go.

36:57.316 --> 36:58.899
You'll never stay, so...

36:58.934 --> 37:03.537
And I'm not gonna say good-bye
or anything sappy like that.

37:06.024 --> 37:07.724
You know how I feel.

37:09.077 --> 37:11.495
Okay.

37:20.472 --> 37:24.074
(babies cooing)

37:24.109 --> 37:27.527
You know, I didn't know where
you were the last four hours.

37:28.914 --> 37:30.597
I know.

37:30.649 --> 37:33.166
I'm sorry.

37:33.168 --> 37:37.687
I thought you ran off to
Mexico and abandoned the kids.

37:39.458 --> 37:45.662
I would never run off to Mexico
and abandon the kids without you.

37:45.714 --> 37:48.715
Promise?

37:48.767 --> 37:51.918
I promise.

37:56.491 --> 38:01.127
I can't stop thinking about
the one we lost, Jack.

38:01.129 --> 38:03.830
I can't. I know...

38:05.434 --> 38:08.134
I know we have these new
babies, and I should be happy,

38:08.170 --> 38:11.788
but I just can't stop
thinking about him.

38:18.213 --> 38:20.497
Me, too.

38:20.549 --> 38:22.782
Yeah? Yeah.

38:22.818 --> 38:25.518
That's all I think about.

38:25.554 --> 38:27.120
I feel... (sighs)

38:27.155 --> 38:29.556
I feel guilty when I think about him,

38:29.591 --> 38:32.375
and then, you know, I-I feel guilty

38:32.411 --> 38:34.694
when I stop thinking about him.

38:34.730 --> 38:37.697
Me, too.

38:39.201 --> 38:41.051
I thought it was just me.

38:41.086 --> 38:43.403
No. It's me, too.

38:48.543 --> 38:51.444
(sniffles) I love you.

38:51.496 --> 38:54.447
I love you, too.
