WEBVTT

00:03.917 --> 00:05.125
Hey, girls. Whatcha doing?

00:05.208 --> 00:07.041
Oh, we're making a list
of all the fun things

00:07.125 --> 00:09.250
we wanna do together
before we go to college.

00:09.375 --> 00:13.166
Kind of like a bucket list except
instead of dying, we're graduating.

00:14.542 --> 00:16.125
Oh okay. Well, what do you have so far?

00:16.208 --> 00:17.542
The word "list".

00:18.667 --> 00:19.750
I came up with that.

00:21.041 --> 00:23.083
I have the perfect idea for you girls.

00:23.417 --> 00:25.750
How about you take a ride
in a hot air balloon?

00:25.834 --> 00:28.834
- Ooh, that sounds good.
- Yup.

00:29.208 --> 00:30.709
Then again, I am afraid of heights.

00:31.125 --> 00:32.834
Yeah, and I'm not crazy about balloons.

00:35.125 --> 00:39.500
Okay, how about watching the sunrise
from the top of Pike's Peak.

00:39.875 --> 00:42.375
Oh, I've always wanted to do that.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.125
Of course we'd have
to get up pretty early.

00:44.208 --> 00:45.875
And I bet it's cold up there.

00:47.333 --> 00:48.583
0-for-two, Ma.

00:49.125 --> 00:51.208
Okay, why don't you two
come up with something?

00:53.333 --> 00:54.417
Road trip.

00:54.500 --> 00:55.667
Road trip.

00:56.125 --> 00:57.583
That's sounds like fun.

00:58.041 --> 00:58.875
Done.

00:59.667 --> 01:01.041

Bob: Hey, neighbors.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.083
To what do we owe the honor?

02:06.166 --> 02:08.750
We came over because we
have some exciting news.

02:08.834 --> 02:10.208
Yeah, we're getting married.

02:11.125 --> 02:12.875
Didn't you two just start dating?

02:12.959 --> 02:14.792
At our age, you don't waste time.

02:17.583 --> 02:18.667
Wow, well...

02:19.250 --> 02:22.333
congratulations and, you know,
many happy years.

02:22.417 --> 02:23.750
Yeah, hold on.

02:24.875 --> 02:26.458
- Hey, listen, RJ.
- PJ.

02:26.542 --> 02:27.875
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

02:28.542 --> 02:30.917
I want you to be my best man.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Me? Why me?

02:33.208 --> 02:35.208
Well, because you're my closest friend...

02:36.917 --> 02:38.458
You know, who's living.

02:38.667 --> 02:39.667
Oh.

02:41.375 --> 02:42.959
Yeah, as you are mine...

02:44.166 --> 02:46.083
Should something terrible
happen to all my friends.

02:47.917 --> 02:51.333
And, Bob, we'd love it
if you would perform the ceremony.

02:51.375 --> 02:52.208
Me?

02:53.875 --> 02:56.250
You can be certified online.

02:56.709 --> 02:58.083
I looked into it.

02:58.166 --> 02:59.166
Yeah...

02:59.250 --> 03:00.959
We figured you'd be the right choice

03:01.041 --> 03:03.625
since we're having the wedding
in your house.

03:04.583 --> 03:05.709
Excuse me?

03:06.208 --> 03:08.458
We wanted to have a destination wedding.

03:08.709 --> 03:11.458
Yeah, so we thought
"across the street"

03:11.542 --> 03:15.041
is the perfect destination.

03:15.417 --> 03:16.542
So what do you say?

03:16.625 --> 03:18.208
- Eh, well...
- Thanks.

03:18.291 --> 03:20.125
That means an awful lot to us.

03:21.166 --> 03:22.208
Bert: Thanks, Bob.

03:26.875 --> 03:28.041
What just happened here?

03:30.208 --> 03:31.542
I'm not sure.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.375
We got to stop answering that door.

03:39.417 --> 03:40.542
Hey, Charlie.

03:41.125 --> 03:42.583
- Have you seen Mom?
- No.

03:42.667 --> 03:43.625
Good.

03:46.125 --> 03:47.125
Ah!

03:49.125 --> 03:50.333
I see her now.

03:55.166 --> 03:56.500
Hey, Mom.

03:56.583 --> 03:57.625
What's all this?

03:58.083 --> 04:01.125
Oh, um, I'm going to go play
catch with Jake.

04:01.333 --> 04:02.333
In a uniform?

04:02.417 --> 04:04.625
We take catch pretty seriously.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.750
Are you playing baseball behind my back?

04:08.834 --> 04:09.750
Not anymore.

04:10.458 --> 04:11.834
Why would you do that?

04:12.166 --> 04:14.000
Because, Mom,
every time you watch me play,

04:14.083 --> 04:16.583
you yell, you scream,
and get totally out of control.

04:16.667 --> 04:18.250
That doesn't sound like me.

04:18.333 --> 04:19.250
Yes, it does.

04:21.333 --> 04:23.375
I can't believe
you're playing secret baseball.

04:23.458 --> 04:26.250
It's only a secret to you. See ya.

04:29.041 --> 04:30.083
Charlie, honey,

04:30.834 --> 04:33.291
you'd never play a sport
behind my back, would you?

04:33.375 --> 04:35.542
- No, Mommy.
- That's my girl.

04:36.792 --> 04:38.542
Hey, Charlie, you ready
for T-ball practice?

04:38.917 --> 04:40.166
Hey!

04:51.667 --> 04:53.375
Hey, Ivy, what's up?

04:53.500 --> 04:56.291
So my dad, he just bought this new RV.

04:56.375 --> 04:59.583
Would you mind checking it out,
make a big deal about how cool it is?

04:59.667 --> 05:01.083
It would really make his day.

05:03.709 --> 05:05.500
- T?
- Sorry.

05:05.583 --> 05:07.709
I was just remembering
something my dad said

05:07.792 --> 05:09.625
about not answering the door.

05:13.875 --> 05:15.417
Welcome aboard, Teddy.

05:15.834 --> 05:18.834
I'm Captain Harry
and the pilot of this vessel.

05:18.917 --> 05:20.500
I believe you know my copilot.

05:20.583 --> 05:21.959
Ahoy, Teddy.

05:23.375 --> 05:27.375
Oh, wow, Mr. Wentz. This is fantastic.

05:27.625 --> 05:31.250
You know, it's a home that has a motor.

05:31.875 --> 05:34.667
And it's recreational...

05:35.041 --> 05:37.208
But it's also a vehicle.

05:38.333 --> 05:39.709
And ain't she a beauty?

05:39.792 --> 05:42.041
Uh, Ivy, give Teddy the tour.

05:42.375 --> 05:43.208
Sure.

05:44.083 --> 05:44.917
Ivy: All right.

05:45.458 --> 05:49.000
This is the kitchen,
dining room, living room.

05:49.083 --> 05:51.750
You should check out
how comfy the seats are.

05:52.166 --> 05:56.125
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

05:56.625 --> 05:58.208
Okay, Dad. Let's go.

05:59.500 --> 06:00.750
What's going on?

06:00.834 --> 06:03.083
Remember the road trip we wanted to take?

06:03.625 --> 06:05.000
We're on it!

06:10.542 --> 06:11.917
Okay, boys,

06:12.000 --> 06:14.583
your dad is about to become
a wedding officiant.

06:15.291 --> 06:17.959
Okay, I hope this isn't too complicated.

06:18.041 --> 06:20.000
Uh, "Name".

06:21.458 --> 06:22.875
"Email address".

06:24.125 --> 06:25.417
"Ordain me".

06:29.750 --> 06:31.125
- I'll get it, dad.
- Hey!

06:31.667 --> 06:33.041
Reverend Bob.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.709
Hey, we're here for the bachelor party.

06:41.792 --> 06:42.917
What bachelor party?

06:43.000 --> 06:44.375
The one you're throwing.

06:44.458 --> 06:46.750
You're my best man. It's part of the job.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.041
Okay, well, come on in.

06:50.667 --> 06:51.667
This is Arnie.

06:51.750 --> 06:54.000
We work together at The Post Office.

06:54.083 --> 06:56.417
I was told there would be food.

06:58.542 --> 07:00.250
Okay, well, uh...

07:00.583 --> 07:03.417
You guys go on downstairs
and I'll put something together.

07:05.542 --> 07:06.875
Hey, come on, Bob.

07:06.959 --> 07:09.542
- Me?
- Yeah. Four's a party.

07:09.834 --> 07:11.583
Three's just sad.

07:14.792 --> 07:16.542
Four can be sad, too.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.625
You ever think my parents
might wonder where I am?

07:25.709 --> 07:27.583
They know exactly where you are.

07:27.667 --> 07:29.166
Your mom even packed your bag.

07:31.166 --> 07:33.333
You know what? I'm making a new list.

07:33.417 --> 07:35.000
And you and my Mom are on it.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.333
Come on, T, it's gonna be fun.

07:40.542 --> 07:42.333
Where are we going, anyway?

07:42.375 --> 07:44.125
Las Vegas.

07:44.417 --> 07:45.875
Oh, I love Vegas!

07:47.000 --> 07:49.375
- Hey, Mr. Wentz?
- Hm?

07:49.458 --> 07:51.250
Um, how long until we get to Las Vegas?

07:51.375 --> 07:52.583
Oh, hard to say.

07:52.667 --> 07:56.542
Depends on how much time we spend
at the mystery stop.

07:56.625 --> 07:58.834
We're making a mystery stop?

07:58.917 --> 08:01.000
Oh, I love Harry's mystery stops.

08:01.792 --> 08:04.583
Sometimes they're better
than the final destination.

08:05.834 --> 08:07.834
Ooh, I just got tingly!

08:07.917 --> 08:09.375
Did you girls get tingly?

08:11.500 --> 08:13.208
We might as well get comfortable.

08:13.291 --> 08:14.959
She's gonna be tingly for a while.

08:23.333 --> 08:24.166
Hey, Mom.

08:25.291 --> 08:27.083
Hello, Gabriel.

08:29.166 --> 08:30.750
How was your baseball game?

08:30.834 --> 08:33.417
It was great.
We won 4-1 and I had two hits.

08:33.500 --> 08:37.417
Huh, that sounds like something
a parent might enjoy seeing.

08:38.041 --> 08:40.333
Mom, how long is this gonna go on?

08:40.458 --> 08:41.750
How long is baseball season?

08:43.291 --> 08:47.417
Look, okay, I admit that in the past,
I may have gotten a little...

08:48.208 --> 08:49.291
Animated.

08:50.041 --> 08:51.625
But a person can change.

08:51.709 --> 08:54.458
Yeah, sure, a person can change,
but what about you?

08:55.458 --> 08:56.834
Look, if you let me go to your game,

08:56.917 --> 09:00.291
I promise, that I will be so quiet
you won't even know that I'm there.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.208
What do you think, Toby?
Should I trust her?

09:03.291 --> 09:05.500
No.

09:06.583 --> 09:08.083
Don't listen to him. He's one.

09:09.375 --> 09:11.250
And yet he's probably right.

09:23.959 --> 09:25.250
So...

09:26.750 --> 09:28.500
We've played Pinochle.

09:32.959 --> 09:34.291
Now what do you guys wanna do?

09:34.959 --> 09:37.750
You tell us, best man.

09:40.250 --> 09:43.417
He should have planned more activities.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.375
He's dropping the ball.

09:47.625 --> 09:51.417
Just so you know, old guy whispering
is just like young guy talking.

09:53.709 --> 09:56.417
Your best man has a lot of tude.

09:58.542 --> 10:01.166
Well, I better get upstairs
and make some more sandwiches.

10:01.250 --> 10:02.625
Uh, you need some help with that?

10:02.709 --> 10:04.166
No, you come up with your own excuse.

10:10.417 --> 10:12.458
So you, uh...

10:13.542 --> 10:15.417
You guys were postal workers, huh?

10:16.291 --> 10:17.250
Exterminator.

10:20.667 --> 10:23.959
He's more boring than the son.

10:30.792 --> 10:32.667
"Right lane ends".

10:34.709 --> 10:36.250
"Watch for falling rocks".

10:37.417 --> 10:39.000
Are you gonna read every road sign?

10:39.542 --> 10:42.000
This is how I keep my sanity
on these trips.

10:44.250 --> 10:45.917
"Exit 29B".

10:47.458 --> 10:49.792
This is Mama Bear
cruising down the highway

10:49.875 --> 10:53.667
with a couple of cubbies and a hubby-wubby
on our way to a mystery stop.

10:53.834 --> 10:54.959
Come on back.

10:56.792 --> 10:59.417
This is Mama Bear.
Anybody have their ears on?

11:02.500 --> 11:04.333
Sounds like we got a mud duck.

11:05.875 --> 11:07.792
Affirmative to that, hubby-wubby.

11:09.583 --> 11:11.500
That's CB lingo, Teddy.

11:11.709 --> 11:14.250
What I said was
"sounds like he's got a weak signal".

11:14.375 --> 11:17.125
And I responded, "I agree, husband".

11:21.625 --> 11:23.500
"Speed limit, 70".

11:30.625 --> 11:32.625
You're not peeking, now are you, Mary Lou?

11:32.709 --> 11:36.333
Oh no! I wouldn't spoil a mystery stop.

11:37.250 --> 11:39.667
All right. Open your eyes.

11:40.542 --> 11:42.750
Welcome to the four corners.

11:45.083 --> 11:46.458
Four corners of what?

11:48.125 --> 11:50.458
Ivy, this is the only
place in the whole country

11:50.542 --> 11:53.625
where four states connect
at one single point.

11:54.500 --> 11:58.125
Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico.

11:58.208 --> 11:59.750
Oh, Harry!

11:59.834 --> 12:02.458
Oh, you've done it again!

12:02.542 --> 12:03.750
I know.

12:03.834 --> 12:05.834
It doesn't get much more exciting
than this.

12:08.542 --> 12:11.500
Ivy, could I talk to you for a second?

12:11.583 --> 12:14.417
Sure, which state
would you like to see me in?

12:20.500 --> 12:22.667
Bob: Hey! How are the sandwiches coming?

12:22.750 --> 12:23.834
Couple more minutes.

12:32.208 --> 12:34.041
Hey, Mrs. Dobbs. What are you doing here?

12:34.125 --> 12:36.083
- I have to talk to you.
- Is everything okay?

12:36.166 --> 12:39.500
Oh, PJ, I have to confess
a terrible secret.

12:39.583 --> 12:41.834
You see, I was married before.

12:41.917 --> 12:45.583
Well, that's not that much of a
secret since your name is "Mrs. Dobbs".

12:46.959 --> 12:48.750
- Let me finish.
- Mm-hmm.

12:49.083 --> 12:53.291
My first husband did all the cooking,
so I never learned how.

12:53.583 --> 12:55.333
But Bert raves about your cooking.

12:55.500 --> 13:00.208
That's because I secretly order takeout,
and then serve it as if I made it myself.

13:02.083 --> 13:03.458
Oh, hey, my mom used to do that.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.041
Back when she still cared.

13:06.625 --> 13:07.834
I came over because

13:07.917 --> 13:10.375
- I know you're going to cooking school
- Yeah.

13:10.458 --> 13:13.500
and I was hoping you could
teach me a few things.

13:13.583 --> 13:15.500
Sure, I'd be glad
to give you a few lessons.

13:15.583 --> 13:17.542
I just hope Bert doesn't see me
come over here.

13:17.834 --> 13:19.125
Well, if he does...

13:19.625 --> 13:20.750
You just tell him...

13:21.333 --> 13:23.083
I'm teaching you how to tap dance.

13:26.709 --> 13:27.875
- Yeah.
- Mm.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.375
I'll think of something.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.750
Smile, Teddy!

13:36.834 --> 13:39.750
Mrs. Wentz, if you want me to smile,
you might wanna...

13:39.834 --> 13:41.834
stand in front of the part of me
that smiles.

13:44.125 --> 13:45.750
Got it.

13:45.834 --> 13:48.583
Oh, how's the weather in Arizona,
Mary Lou?

13:48.667 --> 13:51.917
Well, it's sunny and... oh, Harry!

13:52.000 --> 13:54.458
Oh! Gotcha!

13:55.834 --> 13:57.625
Well, this was...

13:59.083 --> 14:01.083
Can we get going now?

14:01.166 --> 14:02.917
Right you are, Ivy.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.750
Onto our final destination,
Las Vegas, New Mexico.

14:07.250 --> 14:09.583
Um, you mean Nevada.

14:09.667 --> 14:10.917
Oh, no, no, no.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.834
That Las Vegas has been done to death.

14:12.917 --> 14:15.417
We're going to Las Vegas, New Mexico.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.792
There's a Las Vegas, New Mexico?

14:17.875 --> 14:19.000
The original.

14:19.542 --> 14:22.917
Uh, I thought we were going
to the one with the spas,

14:23.000 --> 14:25.125
and the pools and the shopping.

14:25.625 --> 14:27.375
What's in Las Vegas, New Mexico?

14:27.458 --> 14:29.250
The rough-rider museum.

14:30.291 --> 14:32.959
The world's largest cactus.

14:34.250 --> 14:36.458
Ivy, did you know about this?

14:36.542 --> 14:37.667
I don't recall.

14:38.125 --> 14:38.959
Really?

14:39.542 --> 14:41.000
Because I'll tell you what I recall.

14:41.083 --> 14:43.458
First, you came up with the idea
for the road trip,

14:43.542 --> 14:45.667
then you lured me into the RV,

14:45.750 --> 14:50.333
and then you conveniently left out
the crucial "New Mexico" part

14:50.458 --> 14:52.333
about Las Vegas, New Mexico.

14:53.500 --> 14:56.750
Ivy, you didn't tell Teddy
we were going to New Mexico?

14:56.834 --> 14:59.417
She didn't tell me
we were leaving the driveway.

14:59.959 --> 15:01.917
Harry, if Teddy
doesn't want to be on this trip,

15:02.000 --> 15:03.208
we should go home.

15:03.291 --> 15:05.500
What? No Rough Riders?

15:05.709 --> 15:07.792
No big cactus?

15:09.166 --> 15:11.291
We can come back another time.

15:11.375 --> 15:12.500
Come on, honey.

15:16.750 --> 15:19.333
Dad, what are you doing?

15:19.709 --> 15:23.208
Seeing what it feels like
to have my heart broken in four states.

15:30.875 --> 15:32.375
Why you doing that?

15:32.583 --> 15:34.709
Because bases are loaded,
and Gabe is up to bat,

15:34.792 --> 15:36.166
and I promised I'd stay calm.

15:38.625 --> 15:40.750
- Strike one!
- What?

15:40.834 --> 15:42.041
Are you out of your...

15:42.709 --> 15:44.000
Zip code?

15:44.917 --> 15:47.792
Because if you are,
welcome to the neighborhood.

15:51.834 --> 15:53.625
Strike two!

15:57.625 --> 15:59.333
You stink, ump.

16:02.458 --> 16:03.959
What? It was Charlie.

16:04.792 --> 16:07.041
I thought you weren't gonna tell your Mom
you were playing.

16:07.125 --> 16:08.792
Yeah, I gave it my best shot.

16:10.792 --> 16:12.208
Strike three!

16:12.250 --> 16:14.375
What? Are you kidding me?

16:14.458 --> 16:16.417
On what planet
is that considered a strike?

16:16.500 --> 16:20.500
You are the sorriest excuse
for an ump I've ever seen!

16:20.583 --> 16:21.959
You think you can do better?

16:22.041 --> 16:23.709
- Yeah.
- Fine.

16:28.709 --> 16:30.000
I thought you changed.

16:30.625 --> 16:31.667
I did...

16:32.333 --> 16:33.583
Then I changed back.

16:37.417 --> 16:38.625
Thank you.

16:44.375 --> 16:45.542
Now this...

16:46.208 --> 16:47.792
Is what we call a spoon.

16:50.166 --> 16:52.542
Say it with me now, "spoon".

16:53.250 --> 16:55.750
Can we speed this up?
The wedding's tomorrow.

16:58.166 --> 16:59.959
Hey, what's going on here?

17:00.041 --> 17:01.667
A five, six, seven, eight.

17:07.291 --> 17:09.583
I came over to give my best man the rings,

17:09.667 --> 17:12.041
but it seems like there's
something going on here.

17:12.709 --> 17:16.125
Bert, there's something I have to confess.

17:16.542 --> 17:17.500
I...

17:18.208 --> 17:19.375
I can't cook.

17:19.917 --> 17:21.834
You've been lying to me all this time?

17:22.417 --> 17:23.750
I'm sorry.

17:23.834 --> 17:26.375
Well, sorry's not good enough.
The wedding's off.

17:29.166 --> 17:30.750
This is awful.

17:30.834 --> 17:32.041
What am I going to do?

17:32.583 --> 17:34.625
Oh, I have an idea.

17:35.875 --> 17:39.041
Oh, that was just the timer,
but I do have an idea.

17:40.417 --> 17:42.000
Bert, wait. Wait, Bert.

17:42.458 --> 17:44.750
- You're making a huge mistake.
- My mind's made up.

17:44.834 --> 17:49.000
- She lied to me and I can't forgive that.
- Come on, everyone makes mistakes.

17:49.083 --> 17:50.875
Did she lie? Yes.

17:50.959 --> 17:52.834
Did that hurt the trust? Yes.

17:52.917 --> 17:55.000
Am I bad at these kinds of speeches? Yes.

17:55.083 --> 17:56.333
But... but...

17:56.417 --> 18:00.625
But, Bert, there's a woman in there
who is learning how to cook just for you.

18:01.208 --> 18:02.667
Now who else is gonna go to that much

18:02.750 --> 18:04.000
trouble to make you happy?

18:06.458 --> 18:09.875
That's all I ever wanted, Bert,
to make you happy.

18:11.041 --> 18:12.625
You can't cook anything?

18:16.375 --> 18:17.959
I can boil a hot dog.

18:20.458 --> 18:23.166
- Well, okay, the wedding's back on.
- Oh!

18:30.166 --> 18:31.375
Ivy: T...

18:33.291 --> 18:35.500
I'm so sorry I tricked you.

18:36.792 --> 18:38.333
I just really wanted you to come along.

18:38.417 --> 18:42.625
Everything's more fun when you're around,
always has been ever since kindergarten.

18:42.709 --> 18:44.375
We met in preschool...

18:46.166 --> 18:47.500
But go on.

18:49.542 --> 18:51.250
I just wanted to spend some time with you.

18:51.834 --> 18:54.125
We're both going away
to different colleges soon

18:54.208 --> 18:56.083
and things are gonna change.

18:57.250 --> 19:00.000
Well, Ivy, we're always
gonna be best friends.

19:00.333 --> 19:01.834
I know, but...

19:02.917 --> 19:04.333
It won't be the same.

19:06.750 --> 19:08.834
I'm gonna miss you so much.

19:09.166 --> 19:10.667
I'm gonna miss you too, T.

19:11.417 --> 19:12.917
And just so you know,

19:13.000 --> 19:15.166
everything's more fun
when you're around too.

19:15.250 --> 19:18.917
This last day was a bad example,
but generally speaking.

19:22.625 --> 19:25.625
Believe it or not,
I'm even gonna miss them.

19:26.792 --> 19:30.083
Mama Bear, this is Teddy Bear.
Come on back.

19:32.375 --> 19:34.375
This is Mama Bear, over.

19:34.542 --> 19:36.917
Teddy Bear would like to
do a little flippity-flop

19:37.000 --> 19:39.333
on the whole Las Vegas thing, over.

19:41.875 --> 19:45.166
Teddy Bear, are you saying
what I think you're saying?

19:45.583 --> 19:49.291
We're going to Las Vegas, New Mexico!

19:49.375 --> 19:50.458
Copy that.

19:55.875 --> 19:57.125
Play ball!

19:58.458 --> 20:00.291
Hey, batter, batter, batter!

20:00.375 --> 20:02.000
Hey, batter, batter, batter, batter!

20:02.083 --> 20:05.208
- Hey...
- Mom, Mom, the umpire doesn't chatter.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.208
Sorry, I just really like that part.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.834
Strike one!

20:12.959 --> 20:14.333
Hey, what are you looking at?

20:14.375 --> 20:16.583
I'll run you out of here so fast
it'll make your head spin.

20:18.125 --> 20:19.667
At least you don't have
to go home with her.

20:21.500 --> 20:24.834
No, no, no, too low! Downstairs! Ball one!

20:25.208 --> 20:26.625
You stink, ump.

20:28.041 --> 20:30.709
Sweetheart, no, not now. Mommy's the ump.

20:30.792 --> 20:31.917
I know.

20:38.291 --> 20:41.083
Well, Charlie, I went to Las Vegas...

20:41.667 --> 20:43.041
New Mexico.

20:43.625 --> 20:47.417
And I'd tell you all about the trip,
but as they say, what happens in Vegas...

20:48.125 --> 20:49.166
Is nothing.

20:50.166 --> 20:52.875
But it doesn't matter because
I was with my best friend,

20:52.959 --> 20:55.291
which means we had a lot of fun.

20:55.583 --> 20:56.875
Oh, hey, check this out.

20:58.166 --> 21:02.667
And so by the power vested in me
by the website "Five Minute Minister".

21:03.166 --> 21:06.458
I pronounce you husband and wife.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.625
I'm always a wreck at these things.

21:14.250 --> 21:15.333
Well, just a...

21:15.417 --> 21:17.709
Just another Duncan-family
living room wedding

21:17.792 --> 21:19.792
between people we barely know.

21:21.542 --> 21:23.000
Wish them good luck, Charlie.

21:27.583 --> 21:30.792
You know what? All this wedding stuff
has really got me thinking.

21:31.125 --> 21:33.250
You and I should go off
on that second honeymoon.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.083
You know, the one we're
always talking about.

21:35.166 --> 21:36.458
You mean Paris?

21:36.542 --> 21:37.625
Where else?

21:39.250 --> 21:41.583
You have got to be kidding me.

21:43.250 --> 21:44.917
Paris, Texas?

21:45.333 --> 21:46.458
Oh, yeah.

21:46.542 --> 21:48.041
What Paris we're you thinking of?

21:48.208 --> 21:50.542
- The one in France!
- Bob: Oh!

21:50.750 --> 21:52.625
That's been done to death.

21:52.709 --> 21:54.667
This is where it's at.

21:55.333 --> 21:56.500
Oh, come on.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.875
Who's gonna choose this place over France?

21:59.125 --> 22:00.542
Howdy, partners.

22:02.250 --> 22:04.625
We didn't know that you
were such world travelers.

22:05.208 --> 22:08.458
Hey, if you wanna join us,
our next stop is Athens.

22:08.542 --> 22:10.333
- Georgia?
- Where else?

22:11.709 --> 22:14.417
Greece. Greece is where else.
