08:43.423 --> 08:46.024
- Yeah, well, we're not really
a "hooks" and "angle"

08:46.026 --> 08:47.726
Kinda company.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.761
- I've literally never heard
her use those words before.

08:49.896 --> 08:52.430
- Now, hold on, if you want pr,
this is part of it.

08:52.499 --> 08:54.365
Hooks, angles,

08:54.401 --> 08:55.967
That's how you break through
the clutter.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.502
- Well, interesting,
because it sounds

08:57.637 --> 08:59.337
Kind of manipulative to me.

08:59.339 --> 09:01.439
- You say manipulative,
I say effective.

09:01.441 --> 09:03.241
- Well, call me old-fashioned,

09:03.243 --> 09:05.176
But when someone
is two hours late,

09:05.312 --> 09:07.245
And they're telling me to
exploit my family's history,

09:07.380 --> 09:08.913
That's my cue to leave.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.514
- Hang on, let me just--
please.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.350
Ginnie. Ladies.

09:12.419 --> 09:13.718
Honestly, if I could
just get one more--

09:13.787 --> 09:15.553
Okay. Okay.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.457
- (sighs)

09:19.526 --> 09:22.060
Well, that-that was just
a miscommunication.

09:22.129 --> 09:23.762
I'm pretty sure
we can fix this.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.864
- Rosie, I appreciate
your positivity,

09:25.866 --> 09:27.865
But you saw how quickly
they ran outta here.

09:27.867 --> 09:30.067
- It's just their products
are so good.

09:30.103 --> 09:33.004
I have their all-purpose spray,
and it smells like happiness.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.806
- Sorry to interrupt.

09:34.941 --> 09:36.875
Foster, I need you to sign
this contract I just closed.

09:38.378 --> 09:40.211
- You locked the,
the cranberry people?

09:40.280 --> 09:41.813
Wow. Huh.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.548
- You know,
while we're doing this,

09:43.683 --> 09:45.282
Maybe you can sign this one,
too?

09:45.319 --> 09:48.019
- Atlas?
Jesus, you're on fire.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.888
- Oh, I'm also gonna need you
to sign off on another one

09:49.890 --> 09:51.222

09:52.492 --> 09:54.359

09:56.496 --> 09:59.431

- Early onset dementia?

09:59.433 --> 10:00.898
- Too many clients, rosie.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.567
Correct me if I'm wrong,

10:02.702 --> 10:04.235
But you just lost a client,
right?

10:04.371 --> 10:06.171

are saying? Because goldie's--

10:06.173 --> 10:07.772
I mean, she just-she had
to leave, but..

10:07.774 --> 10:09.740
I wouldn't say we lost them.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.643

10:17.017 --> 10:18.650
- Did you just hiss at me?
- No.

10:21.488 --> 10:22.988
- It sounded like a hiss.

10:24.724 --> 10:26.324
- He's not wrong, I did hiss.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.059
But I'm not proud of it.

an easy mistake to make

17:21.508 --> 17:23.140
Because it was a tupperware.

17:23.176 --> 17:25.342
So I just sort of gathered
all the stuff.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.545
I could tell he was at peace,
though, just from the...

17:27.614 --> 17:30.481
Sort of--
and put it in the garbage.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.383
- The garbage, huh?

17:32.452 --> 17:34.685
- Yeah, I didn't know
what to do.

17:34.687 --> 17:36.821
- What you should've done
is put it in the compost.

17:36.890 --> 17:38.489
- My mistake.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.491
- Does he have any friends
he may have gone to?

17:40.527 --> 17:42.827
- Honestly, we haven't heard
of a single friend.

17:42.962 --> 17:44.695
- Except for the frog.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.299
Most runaways come home
within an hour or two,

17:48.368 --> 17:50.902
If he's not back within
24 hours, give us a call.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.503
- Thanks.
- Thank you, officer.

17:52.539 --> 17:53.905
(footsteps recede)

17:53.907 --> 17:55.473
- (sighs)

17:55.475 --> 17:56.874
(light clicks on)

18:00.613 --> 18:01.945
(apologetic exhale)

18:03.316 --> 18:05.182
Sorry, buddy.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.051
(sighs)

18:07.186 --> 18:08.452
<i>Nathan jr.: Hey, you've reached</i>
<i> nathan podeski,</i>

18:08.488 --> 18:10.321
<i> Please leave a message,</i>
<i> and I'll get back--</i>

18:10.323 --> 18:12.056
(call ends)
(sighs)

18:16.762 --> 18:18.262
(weak blow)

18:19.466 --> 18:21.065
(squeaks)
kid's talented.

18:23.202 --> 18:24.969
- Um, what are you doing?
- Hey! Hi.

18:24.971 --> 18:26.671
You-you're okay, thank god.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.539
I'll text your dad, he's out
there looking for you.

18:31.144 --> 18:34.078
- Um, I'm sorry about coltrane.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.281
- Did you boil him from
the inside

18:37.283 --> 18:39.116
Because I ruined your photos?
- What? No!

18:39.119 --> 18:41.919
It was a horrible accident,
truly.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.189
Listen, I'm uh...

18:45.258 --> 18:48.259
I'm on unchartered
territory here, and uh,

18:48.394 --> 18:50.695
I'm gonna make some mistakes,

18:50.697 --> 18:54.464
Maybe even... Some grave ones
for which I am deeply,

18:55.968 --> 18:57.501
Deeply sorry.

18:57.537 --> 18:59.770
I hope you can forgive me
and be patient with me,

18:59.806 --> 19:01.706
Because I just, I want to make
you feel welcome here,

19:01.841 --> 19:03.174
I really do.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.510
- I'm sorry I left charlie
and ella alone,

19:06.513 --> 19:09.213
I shouldn't have done that.
- No, you shouldn't have.

19:09.282 --> 19:11.782
- I know it must be weird
having to care for someone

19:11.918 --> 19:13.984
That you barely even know.
- No!

19:14.020 --> 19:16.520
- But you're now a part
of my family as much

19:16.523 --> 19:18.255
As I'm a part of yours.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.990
- I like that.

19:22.162 --> 19:24.028
(chain rattles)

19:24.030 --> 19:26.997
You got me a necklace?
That's so nice.

19:27.066 --> 19:29.299
Thank you.
- It was my mom's.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.302
- It's your mother's necklace.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.439
- It would mean a lot to me
if you'd wear it.

19:37.010 --> 19:39.610
- Huh? You want me
to wear this?

19:39.745 --> 19:41.378
- I do.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.216
- I think it's nice.

19:46.252 --> 19:47.885
- Yeah, it's a real
statement piece.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.620
The way it knocks into
my collar bones,

19:49.656 --> 19:51.822
I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna bruise. Oy!

19:51.824 --> 19:53.624
- I mean, I like it on you.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.427
- Yeah? You like this?

19:56.496 --> 19:58.696
Hmm? How about this?

19:58.765 --> 20:01.532
You like this staring back
at you from around my neck?

20:01.534 --> 20:03.434
Does that feel normal to you?

20:03.569 --> 20:05.636
- This is like the picture
on the fridge all over again.

20:05.705 --> 20:08.372
He is messing with me.
He's trying to push us apart,

20:08.374 --> 20:11.308
And get you all to himself,
and make me crazy!

20:12.812 --> 20:14.978
- Or he's trying to keep
her memory alive.

20:15.014 --> 20:16.714
(knocking)

20:16.849 --> 20:19.116
Oh, hey, buddy.

20:19.252 --> 20:22.186
- I um, I can't shake the image
of coltrane in the microwave.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.456
- (sighs)
- poor guy.

20:25.525 --> 20:27.658
- Yeah, I'm sorry again
about that, I, um...

20:27.660 --> 20:29.359
- Which is why I'd really like
to sleep here with you, dad.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.797
- Oh. Of course.

20:32.799 --> 20:34.465
- Wait, what?

20:34.600 --> 20:36.733
- He's mourning.
- Right.

20:39.138 --> 20:41.472
- Oh, I'm-I'm sure we can
all squeeze in here, kate.

20:41.607 --> 20:43.941
Or you can sleep in my room.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.476
- Your room?

20:47.880 --> 20:49.513
- Sure.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.416
- Okay.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.585
You guys look pretty cute.
(chuckles)

20:57.223 --> 20:58.689
Okay.

20:58.824 --> 21:00.491
♪ throw it on the fire

21:00.560 --> 21:02.827
Sleep tight.
