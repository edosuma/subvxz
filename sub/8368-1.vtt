<i>I'm Rob Seal.</i>

I'm from Lake View Terrace,

02:27.715 --> 02:30.216
<i>I attended Cinema Makeup School

<i>and I've been working in there

02:32.386 --> 02:36.188
I'm 20, but I know
I have the skill to win.

02:36.224 --> 02:38.324
<i>My name is Ant. I'm
from Williamstown, New Jersey,</i>

02:38.359 --> 02:40.960

02:42.763 --> 02:44.096
<i>After makeup school,</i>

02:44.132 --> 02:46.132

02:46.167 --> 02:47.733
<i>But I want to do makeup

02:47.768 --> 02:51.670

02:51.706 --> 02:53.572
I'm Jennifer,

02:53.608 --> 02:55.341

02:55.376 --> 02:57.743
<i>I got into makeup effects

03:09.490 --> 03:10.789

03:10.842 --> 03:13.075

03:13.127 --> 03:14.510

03:14.562 --> 03:15.961
<i>I love video games.</i>

03:16.013 --> 03:19.448
<i>I love horror movies... the

03:19.484 --> 03:21.133
I'm still afraid of them.

03:21.169 --> 03:22.401
<i>I've done a lot of haunts.</i>

03:22.436 --> 03:23.969
<i>I've done independent films.</i>

03:24.005 --> 03:26.071
<i>But I haven't had the shot

03:26.107 --> 03:27.606

03:41.322 --> 03:42.922
<i>I'm from Hightstown, New Jersey,</i>

03:45.126 --> 03:46.325
<i>for about six years.</i>

03:46.360 --> 03:48.160
<i>I started in college

03:48.196 --> 03:50.696
<i>and then I went

03:50.731 --> 03:52.698
<i>My natural inclination

03:52.733 --> 03:56.969
is to be completely panicked
constantly, so right now,

03:56.971 --> 04:00.873
I'm up to my eyeballs
in terror of what comes next.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.628
- Oh, my God!
- Wow.

04:05.680 --> 04:06.845
This is amazing.

04:06.881 --> 04:07.980
It's so cool.

04:08.015 --> 04:10.566
- Whoa.
- There's McKenzie.

04:10.601 --> 04:11.850
Oh, my God.

04:11.886 --> 04:13.185
This is insane.

04:13.221 --> 04:15.104

Off when McKenzie's saying it

04:22.463 --> 04:24.029
<i>right in front of you.</i>

04:24.065 --> 04:26.098
You guys ready to prove

all: - Yes.

04:28.236 --> 04:29.535
Excellent,

04:29.587 --> 04:32.538
because I'm about to throw you
right into the deep end.

04:32.590 --> 04:33.872
Okay.

04:33.908 --> 04:37.476
Your first Spotlight Challenge
starts right now.

04:37.528 --> 04:40.379
- Oh, no.
- We're here for ten minutes,

04:40.414 --> 04:41.463
and McKenzie already tells us
we have our first

04:41.499 --> 04:43.048
Spotlight Challenge.

04:43.084 --> 04:45.768
I haven't even got comfortable.
I haven't unpacked yet.

04:45.820 --> 04:47.236
You'll be paying homage

04:47.271 --> 04:50.556

but beloved characters

04:50.591 --> 04:52.141
in the sci-fi universe.

04:52.193 --> 04:54.793
His ne'er-do-wells

04:54.795 --> 04:57.496

The Empire Strikes Back,

04:57.531 --> 04:58.731
<i>Guardians of the Galaxy,</i>

04:58.766 --> 05:00.332
<i>and The Chronicles of Riddick
franchise.</i>

05:00.368 --> 05:03.352
There's just something
about bounty hunters

05:03.387 --> 05:05.154
that we all seem to love.

05:05.206 --> 05:07.306
[all cheering]

05:07.358 --> 05:09.642
Yes, bounty hunters.
I love bounty hunters.

05:09.644 --> 05:10.693
That's right.

05:10.728 --> 05:12.745
You will be creating
your very own

05:12.780 --> 05:14.113
alien bounty hunters.

05:14.148 --> 05:15.364
- Nice.
- Yes.

05:15.399 --> 05:16.649
But you're gonna
need a little inspiration

05:16.651 --> 05:17.950
to help you get started, right?

05:17.952 --> 05:19.752
All: Yeah.

- Oh!
- Nice.

05:25.159 --> 05:26.475
Awesome.

05:26.510 --> 05:30.262
So as you can see,
there are seven wanted posters.

05:30.264 --> 05:34.316
Each poster features a name
of a rogue alien bounty hunter,

05:34.352 --> 05:36.101
their last known whereabouts,

05:36.103 --> 05:39.271
and, most importantly,
a depiction of their ship.

05:39.323 --> 05:41.840
You'll choose one of them
and use it as inspiration

05:41.876 --> 05:44.610
to create your alien bounty
hunter on the run.

05:44.662 --> 05:45.794
- All right, cool.
- Yes.

05:45.830 --> 05:47.863
- Let's get you paired up.
- All right.

05:47.898 --> 05:51.917

Anna and Melissa, you're next.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.333
It's really unexpected

06:41.369 --> 06:42.918
to have bounty hunters
as a first challenge,

06:42.953 --> 06:45.704
and I'm super excited

06:45.740 --> 06:48.273
<i>I'm Melissa, and I'm

<i>I usually work

07:00.488 --> 07:02.087
that's just
such a great feeling.

07:02.123 --> 07:04.189
I was thinking
we could have, like, a fin here.

07:04.241 --> 07:05.858
<i>Anna and I picked Tolo Ezulon.</i>

07:05.860 --> 07:08.794
He's got this cool ship with spikes

07:08.829 --> 07:10.362
<i>that we're using
in a skull shape.</i>

07:10.398 --> 07:13.465
We can bring the orange

I'm Anna. I'm 31.

07:15.136 --> 07:16.435
I'm from Chicago.

<i>I was working

I have into this competition.

07:30.818 --> 07:33.552
- Perfect.
- We're on it, man.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.387
My teammate is Robert,

07:35.439 --> 07:37.106
and he is quite the character.

07:37.141 --> 07:39.558
This is Honorin Fallador.

07:39.610 --> 07:42.161
Only a German
can pronounce his name.

07:44.632 --> 07:46.248
He will kill you
if he has had a bad day.

07:46.300 --> 07:47.266
Yeah.

07:47.301 --> 07:48.500
I grew up in Germany,

07:48.502 --> 07:51.503
but my father
was actually from Texas,

07:51.555 --> 07:56.208
so I'm kind
of a Texas-German mutant.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.010
<i>Before I became a makeup artist,</i>

07:58.045 --> 08:00.078
<i>I was a dental technician.</i>

08:00.114 --> 08:04.233
I still sometimes wake up
screaming that I have to go back

08:04.285 --> 08:06.452
working as a technician.

08:06.487 --> 08:08.053
I just hated it.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.521
<i>In '99, I came here.</i>

08:09.557 --> 08:12.024
<i>I did my training
in Cinema Makeup School,</i>

08:12.059 --> 08:16.361
eventually started teaching
there, and now that I'm here,

08:16.397 --> 08:18.230
I might even go
completely insane.

08:29.043 --> 08:30.409
It's very surreal.

08:30.444 --> 08:31.627
It's like, we made it!

08:31.679 --> 08:34.313
I'm Yvonne,

08:34.347 --> 08:36.782
from Vancouver Film School's
makeup design program.

08:36.817 --> 08:39.451
<i>I worked in a effects shop
in Vancouver on a couple</i>

08:39.486 --> 08:42.354
<i>of big movies like Rise
of the Planet of the Apes.</i>

08:42.389 --> 08:44.389
<i>For the past two years,
I've been doing indie films</i>

08:44.425 --> 08:46.024
<i>and foam sculpting
to pay the bills,</i>

08:46.060 --> 08:48.327
so this is really
cool to be here.

08:48.362 --> 08:50.329
The ship feels military to me,

08:50.364 --> 08:51.930
so some kind
of military background.

08:51.966 --> 08:54.333
I'm Greg. I'm from Allentown,
Pennsylvania.

08:54.335 --> 08:56.285
<i>My dad wanted me to go
into the family business</i>

08:56.337 --> 08:57.669
<i>and be an electrician,</i>

08:57.705 --> 08:59.304
<i>but after working on a haunt,</i>

08:59.340 --> 09:00.873
<i>I fell in love
with makeup effects.</i>

09:00.908 --> 09:02.374
<i>Four years later,</i>

09:02.409 --> 09:04.676
<i>I graduated from the Savini

Do you want to bring the tail
fin design into the head itself?

Yeah.

All right, I need to let
you guys know that this season,

a one-time special immunity.

27:23.463 --> 27:25.163
That means if you ever end up
in the bottom,

27:25.215 --> 27:27.899

deserve a second chance,

to save you from elimination.

was really dry, really warm,

33:42.337 --> 33:43.903
We also wanted to take an animal

33:52.481 --> 33:55.382
I sculpted the face,
the fabricated armor,

33:55.450 --> 33:56.816
and I sculpted the horns.

33:56.868 --> 34:00.286
I sculpted the cowl,
and I body-painted him.

- Thank you.

warm tones.

34:09.031 --> 34:11.498

was the captain's daughter

34:43.849 --> 34:45.181
on this military vessel.

34:45.266 --> 34:47.100
She mutinied
against her own father,

34:47.168 --> 34:49.168
and now she works
for the highest bidder.

34:49.237 --> 34:50.270
I started the face.

34:50.322 --> 34:51.271
He finished it.

34:51.322 --> 34:52.371
He started the cowl.

34:52.424 --> 34:53.840
I finished it.

34:53.891 --> 34:57.711
This not one of my favorite
makeups up here this evening.

34:57.796 --> 34:59.379
Your paint job is poor.

34:59.464 --> 35:00.680
You don't have zones.

35:00.749 --> 35:04.317
You just have highlight
and shadow and a flat color.

35:04.386 --> 35:05.969
Around the cheek area,

35:06.054 --> 35:09.255
you've got this strong
architectural bone line

35:09.324 --> 35:11.591
which doesn't fit the rest
of the form language,

35:11.660 --> 35:14.861
and it's in an area where it's
gonna have to articulate.

35:14.896 --> 35:17.330
So just keep those things
in mind should you move forward.

35:17.399 --> 35:18.665

you worked together?

35:20.836 --> 35:22.869
- Poorly.
- It's a shame.

There were some ideas
here that I like.

35:24.956 --> 35:27.457

35:57.222 --> 35:59.472

I sculpted the cowl

Hi, judges.
So why don't we talk

38:22.584 --> 38:23.783
about your favorites tonight?

38:23.868 --> 38:25.468
Let's start
with Walter and Kaleb.

38:25.553 --> 38:27.053
They were very, very successful

38:27.122 --> 38:28.655
in creating
a complete character.

38:28.723 --> 38:30.540
There's a lot
of good ideas in the paint.

38:30.625 --> 38:31.691
Really well done.

38:31.760 --> 38:33.760
One of the features
that stood out

38:33.795 --> 38:35.061
was the facial sculpt.

38:35.130 --> 38:38.965
The strong chin conveyed
that this was a bounty hunter.

38:39.034 --> 38:41.534
They used a lot of color,
but they did it in zones,

38:41.603 --> 38:42.685
and it really read well.

38:42.771 --> 38:44.037
It was nicely done.

38:44.089 --> 38:46.873
All right, judges, let's move
on to Anna and Melissa.

38:46.942 --> 38:49.609
The cowl piece that Melissa
sculpted was quite beautiful,

38:49.678 --> 38:51.561
and it was
a really great paint job...

38:51.646 --> 38:52.845
just those little pops of red

38:52.897 --> 38:55.348
here and there to make
it cohesive with the ship.

38:55.417 --> 38:58.134
The ideas here were so solid.

38:58.219 --> 39:00.253
All right, judges, why don't
we move on to the makeups

39:00.305 --> 39:02.422
that didn't come together
this week?

39:02.474 --> 39:03.790
Johnny and Ant.

39:03.858 --> 39:06.292
The form
in the face is unforgivable.

39:06.361 --> 39:07.827
- Agreed.
- It's so blocky.

39:07.896 --> 39:10.830
That is the most glaring problem
on the makeup.

39:10.882 --> 39:12.632
The overall silhouette
was actually quite good

39:12.701 --> 39:14.500
on this character.
Those ear details.

39:14.569 --> 39:17.437
Love the ears. I don't think
that this was a failure

39:17.505 --> 39:19.872
due to lack of
technical prowess.

39:19.924 --> 39:20.923
- Yeah.
- It was just them

39:21.009 --> 39:22.008
- not getting along.
- Butting heads.

39:22.093 --> 39:24.110
Let's talk
about Yvonne and Greg.

39:24.179 --> 39:26.746
They just didn't know
how to dig themselves

39:26.815 --> 39:28.314
out of that hole
once they were there.

39:28.383 --> 39:31.651
And putting that goofy nose on
it was such a horrible mistake.

39:31.720 --> 39:33.786
Okay, have you made up
your minds?

39:33.855 --> 39:36.055
- Yes, we have.
- Let's bring them back out.

39:39.144 --> 39:41.811
All right, Glenn,
tell us about the top teams.

39:41.896 --> 39:43.463
Walter and Kaleb,

39:43.531 --> 39:45.999
we love the way that you
used color zones throughout,

39:46.067 --> 39:49.602
and overall, your character
is very successful head to toe.

39:49.671 --> 39:52.839
Anna and Melissa, you
gave us some really intricate

39:52.891 --> 39:54.574
and interesting sculpting,

39:54.642 --> 39:57.844
and your bounty hunter seemed
like a perfect fit for his ship.

did the right thing by trying
to give us something unique,

some of those shapes too far,

41:35.649 --> 41:38.250

really served to highlight that.

your inability to identify
the biological versus
