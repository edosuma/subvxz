04:34.857 --> 04:36.359

is that outlet?

09:10.383 --> 09:11.634
A mile and a half.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.219
Glad to be in business
with you, Jimmy.

09:13.302 --> 09:15.846

You're good,

09:15.930 --> 09:18.557

{\an1}It gives the illusion
of high heels,

09:27.441 --> 09:29.902
{\an1}and everybody knows
that high heels

09:29.986 --> 09:31.320

ultra-shapely.

09:31.404 --> 09:35.199
{\an1}Well, this is more fun
than I expected.

09:35.283 --> 09:36.325
Yeah, right.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.827
Oh, come, Ginger.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.079
Where's your
Caprice spirit?

09:40.162 --> 09:41.330
I must have left it at home.

09:41.414 --> 09:45.293
{\an1}I think somebody's
missing her boyfriend.

09:45.376 --> 09:48.004
Vanessa, stay on
this side of the buoys.

09:48.087 --> 09:49.839
You're not missing Darren?

09:49.922 --> 09:51.382
Since the moment we got here,

09:51.465 --> 09:53.634
all I've been thinking
about is Sasha.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.344
Darren's hardly popped
into my head at all,

09:55.428 --> 09:58.222
except when I'm
obsessing over Sasha

09:58.306 --> 10:00.808
{\an1}and remember that I'm not
thinking about Darren.

10:00.891 --> 10:02.310
That's perfectly
understandable.

10:02.393 --> 10:03.102
{\an3}It is?

10:03.185 --> 10:03.853
Of course.

10:03.936 --> 10:06.147
This is where you
first met Sasha.

10:06.230 --> 10:06.939
And let's face it,

10:07.023 --> 10:09.233
the two of you were
quite the fit.

10:09.317 --> 10:12.028
{\an1}You did write that
nauseating little song.

10:12.111 --> 10:14.905
Yeah, but the last time
we saw each other

10:14.989 --> 10:15.823
was kind of a disaster.

10:15.906 --> 10:19.327
But even still, this is
so unfair to Darren.

10:19.410 --> 10:20.244
Darren's at home; you're here.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.705
So what if you're thinking

10:22.788 --> 10:24.290
about Sasha?

don't get shocked.

10:38.721 --> 10:40.222

to Mrs. Foutley.

DAVE'S MOTHER:
I am so disappointed

11:19.762 --> 11:21.263

11:21.347 --> 11:24.558
We talked about me coming down
this weekend months ago.

11:24.642 --> 11:26.560
How could you forget?

11:26.644 --> 11:27.603
{\an1}Yeah...

11:27.686 --> 11:28.938
how could you?

11:29.021 --> 11:31.273
It must be

11:39.365 --> 11:41.325

for a moment?

Oh, sure.

Dave...

11:50.709 --> 11:52.670
where is she
going to stay?

11:52.753 --> 11:54.630
{\an1}Well, she can't
stay at my place.

11:54.713 --> 11:57.466
I mean, the ant poison
would likely kill her.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.134
Don't be so sure.

11:58.217 --> 11:59.677
How about a hotel?

11:59.760 --> 12:04.306

I have an irrational
fear of hotel rooms!

12:04.390 --> 12:06.267
{\an1}I could always go
to a hotel.

{\an5}Mom, why don't you
make yourself at home
in Ginger's room?

12:23.826 --> 12:25.369
Dave can stay

For a nominal fee.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.542
and I'll get

14:31.579 --> 14:33.956
Isn't this
just the greatest?

14:34.039 --> 14:36.000
I mean, I have
always loved Caprice,

but being a leader?

14:37.585 --> 14:39.211

That's great.

14:45.884 --> 14:47.469
{\an1}I should have never

14:47.553 --> 14:50.097
What are you
talking about?

14:50.180 --> 14:50.848
Dodie, I thought

14:50.931 --> 14:52.516
{\an1}going to camp
might be good for me,

14:52.600 --> 14:54.810
{\an1}that being away
from Darren

14:54.893 --> 14:56.770
{\an1}would make me
appreciate him more,

14:56.854 --> 14:58.939
but it's backfired.

14:59.023 --> 15:01.483
{\an1}I mean, how am I
supposed to miss Darren

15:01.567 --> 15:03.527
{\an1}when all I can think about
is Sasha?

15:03.611 --> 15:06.030
Ginger,
this is huge.

15:06.113 --> 15:09.366
{\an4}Courtney said
it's because Sasha
and I had electricity.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.160
Courtney knows?

15:11.243 --> 15:13.662
I... I can't believe
you would tell Courtney

before telling me.

your advice right now.

this way?

not miss someone

if you really want
to be with that person

15:26.175 --> 15:28.344

your time obsessing

about the person you didn't
expect to obsess about.

you don't want Darren

anymore.

The arrow gave it away, huh?

19:02.891 --> 19:04.017
Yeah, I guess.

19:04.101 --> 19:05.727
Lucky for me
you're a good shot.

19:05.811 --> 19:07.312
Lucky for Macie--

19:07.396 --> 19:09.022

to the left.

19:09.106 --> 19:10.858

19:10.941 --> 19:12.901
{\an1}Melanie asked
if I'd seen you yet.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.653
{\an1}She wants us
to get married.

19:14.736 --> 19:18.407
Sasha... I have a boyfriend.

19:18.490 --> 19:18.740
Yeah?

19:18.824 --> 19:21.034
I'm serious.

19:21.118 --> 19:22.661
So? I have a girlfriend.

19:22.744 --> 19:23.912
You remember Clover.

19:23.996 --> 19:24.872
(<i> thunder crashes,</i>

19:24.955 --> 19:28.709
{\an5}You're still seeing Clover?

19:24.955 --> 19:28.709
Yeah.

19:28.792 --> 19:31.086
Then why did you
nearly impale my best friend

19:31.169 --> 19:33.380
sending a note asking me
to meet you here

19:33.463 --> 19:36.967
and then arrive like some knight
in shining armor or something?

19:37.050 --> 19:38.635
What are you talking about?

19:38.719 --> 19:40.429
I thought you
wanted to see me.

19:40.512 --> 19:42.222
I did,

19:42.306 --> 19:43.765
but I just wanted to say hey.

19:43.849 --> 19:44.933
It's not like I wanted
a date or anything.

Come on, I'll give you

20:09.541 --> 20:11.877
No, that's okay, I'll walk.

20:11.960 --> 20:12.294
