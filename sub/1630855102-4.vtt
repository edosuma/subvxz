How'd you feel about
getting married here?

21:36.545 --> 21:38.296
Really?

21:38.380 --> 21:40.090
Yeah, I think, um...

21:40.173 --> 21:42.718
I think it'd mean
a lot to my dad.

21:42.801 --> 21:45.929
-Oh, babe. That's amazing.
-I love that.

21:46.013 --> 21:48.140
-Are you kidding around?
-You don't have to
let us know right now.

21:48.223 --> 21:50.392
You can think about it
if you want, you know.

21:50.475 --> 21:52.185
I-I want to.

21:52.269 --> 21:53.895
-This is beautiful.
-This is perfect!

21:53.979 --> 21:56.064
We can get you probably, like,
friends and family rate,

21:56.148 --> 21:57.357
-five, 10K, you know?
-(giggles)

21:57.441 --> 21:59.317
-Alright.
-Just for the night,
then, of course,

21:59.401 --> 22:01.695
we'll have to, uh...
There's gonna be
the reception,

22:01.778 --> 22:03.071
so that'd be
another five, 10K.

22:03.155 --> 22:05.240
That's alright.
I had a great year
at the school.

22:05.323 --> 22:07.034
And, you know,
she's great with numbers.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.452
See, they pay
teachers too much.

22:08.535 --> 22:09.786
-Yeah, we'll make it work.
-No, it's on us.

22:09.870 --> 22:11.830
We can fuck it up,
do whatever we want.

22:11.913 --> 22:13.832
But this is gorgeous.
I mean, this is
absolutely stunning.

22:13.915 --> 22:16.334
It is, and you can see
all the sunflowers over here.

22:16.418 --> 22:17.878
And we just
cleaned out the barn.

22:17.961 --> 22:20.005
-Coincidentally... Yes!
-Susan: We could
party in the barn?

22:20.088 --> 22:21.381
It's probably only
gonna work for you

22:21.465 --> 22:23.759
-if you love extreme
natural beauty.
-(laughter)

22:23.842 --> 22:25.594
-We love it.
-I do! I'm marrying it!

No! I would never
get a colonic.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.959
I would. (laughs)

There really is
something to be said

and goin' it alone.

24:11.408 --> 24:13.326

-Yeah.

24:22.252 --> 24:24.588
if I turn up like my mother,

24:24.671 --> 24:27.799
you will put me

-A pillow right over the face.

Ah, Joel, I'd be
a shell without you.

Mm...

24:36.975 --> 24:38.518
You want another twist?

24:38.602 --> 24:40.937
Only if you think
I'm worth the trouble.

24:42.480 --> 24:45.025
-Thank you.
-Plus, I didn't get
a lot of steps today,

24:45.108 --> 24:46.860
so I'm gonna go for it.

24:48.778 --> 24:53.074

It's just vodka.

Oh, honey, you know
I infuse it with love, too.

24:57.078 --> 24:58.914
(laughs) Oh, thank you.

24:59.956 --> 25:01.374
I like it when you
put the twist in.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.919
Like, if there's one twist,
I know I've had one.

25:04.002 --> 25:05.629
If there's two twists,
I know I've had three.

25:05.712 --> 25:08.590
And if I have three twists,
I can't have any more.

25:08.673 --> 25:11.259

25:11.343 --> 25:13.887

-What?

I think you just said?
-No, no, no, no, no!

You can't take it back!

that tonight anyway?

Oh. Don't worry about it.
