WEBVTT

00:09.763 --> 00:13.571
It's weird.
It's starting to feel normal.

00:13.604 --> 00:15.575
Being here, I mean.

00:15.608 --> 00:19.516
Yeah, I never thought
I'd be okay smelling this bad.

00:19.549 --> 00:23.290
It's like the present
almost feels...

00:23.323 --> 00:28.501
fuzzy now, which is like...
really fucked.

00:28.534 --> 00:30.204
Yeah.

00:30.237 --> 00:33.243
-This one time...
-Mm-hmm?

00:33.912 --> 00:38.588
...I was at Big Bear,
and I was tripping acid,
like, real acid,

00:38.621 --> 00:42.461
and I just fully forgot
what life was before tripping.

00:42.495 --> 00:45.467
And so I just ended up
sitting cross-legged

00:45.501 --> 00:47.539
next to my friend in a tent

00:47.572 --> 00:51.212
just chanting the names
of chain stores like a mantra,

00:51.245 --> 00:56.289
like, "Target, Walmart,
Walgreens,

00:56.322 --> 00:58.360
Walmart, Target,
Walgreens, Walmart."

00:58.393 --> 01:01.433
-Why?
-I don't know.
I guess they just...

01:01.466 --> 01:04.305
represented a return
to the real world for me or...

01:06.710 --> 01:09.148
Mmm.

01:09.650 --> 01:13.758
Oh, I know. I could just,
like, hold you underwater
super gently.

01:13.791 --> 01:16.764
-That sounds horrible.
-Mm-hmm.

01:16.797 --> 01:19.302
-That's kind of the point.
-(chuckles)

01:19.335 --> 01:22.241
It wouldn't work because
I'd know what you're up to.

01:22.274 --> 01:26.817
Okay, got it.
I hire someone else to stab
you.

01:26.850 --> 01:29.255
-No!
-Just, like, almost stab you.

01:29.288 --> 01:31.794
No. What if I actually die?

01:31.827 --> 01:33.631
You don't like
any of my ideas.

01:33.664 --> 01:36.436
Because you're not the one
getting stabbed.

01:36.469 --> 01:38.808
(music playing
over headphones)

01:38.841 --> 01:43.250
I'm weirdly into this book,
Robinson Crusoe.

01:43.283 --> 01:45.254
Rufus let me read it to him,
like, all day yesterday,

01:45.287 --> 01:48.628
and I'm, like,
actually invested.

01:48.661 --> 01:50.832
-(Kevin chuckles)
-It's so good.

01:50.865 --> 01:56.409
If you can somehow shut out
the fact that this whole thing

01:56.442 --> 01:59.616
is happening in a terrifying
and horrible time and place...

01:59.649 --> 02:02.321
Mm-hmm?

02:02.354 --> 02:04.660
...it's-- it's kind of like
a retreat.

02:04.693 --> 02:07.364
(both chuckle)

02:09.301 --> 02:12.274
So is that technically
a cornrow?

I think we could

03:50.437 --> 03:53.678
I'm bored.
Can we read something else?

-DANA: What? You're bored?

03:55.715 --> 03:59.422

It's-- it's getting good.

04:01.994 --> 04:04.666
What do you think
of Robinson Crusoe?

MARGARET: Carrie? Carrie!

04:08.574 --> 04:12.582
That I deign to search
for my own attendant
is cause enough to box your
ear.

04:12.615 --> 04:15.988
It's my fault, Mama.
I asked her to listen
to Dana with me.

04:18.761 --> 04:22.468
Rufus, I should have it
that Dana shall no longer
read to you.

04:22.502 --> 04:23.971
-But, Mommy--
-Hey!

04:25.708 --> 04:27.946
Mr. Weylin
will better see Dana's value

04:27.979 --> 04:30.585
elsewhere in the house.
You understand, Mr. Franklin.

04:30.618 --> 04:34.458
In any case, young man,
your piano lessons
start presently.

04:34.492 --> 04:36.897
I don't want
any damn piano lessons!

04:36.930 --> 04:40.572
Rufus Weylin, I will
not tolerate such language.

04:40.605 --> 04:43.711
It's okay, Rufus. It's okay.

04:43.744 --> 04:47.585
Mr. Franklin's a great
teacher. You'll have fun.
Promise.

04:50.958 --> 04:54.700
You might want to start
with emptying
Mr. Franklin's bedpans.

04:54.733 --> 04:58.674
-Oh...
-Yes, Miss Margaret.

05:17.712 --> 05:22.522
Right? So this is C position.

05:22.555 --> 05:25.027
So your thumb is on the white
key before the two black keys.

05:25.060 --> 05:27.766
MARGARET: Good day.

05:27.799 --> 05:29.903
-May I watch?
-Yeah. Yeah.

05:29.936 --> 05:32.642
We're just, uh, getting
acquainted with the
instrument.

05:32.675 --> 05:34.478
-Um...
-(chuckles)

05:34.512 --> 05:36.583
Rufus, why don't you show
your mom what you learned?

05:38.988 --> 05:42.027

05:42.060 --> 05:45.835
(chuckles) Rufus! Mmm!

05:45.868 --> 05:48.005
That is marvelous.

05:48.507 --> 05:51.580
Should display your progress
to Mr. Deighton tomorrow.

05:51.613 --> 05:54.653
-Mr. Deighton?
-Yes. A widower and solicitor,

05:54.686 --> 05:55.855
and he and his daughter--

05:55.888 --> 05:57.826
they are to dine
with us tomorrow.

05:57.859 --> 05:59.663
(notes playing on piano)

05:59.696 --> 06:01.967
Rufus, I hear that Philippa
is very handsome.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.640
-I don't want to meet her.
-Hush.

06:04.673 --> 06:05.975
You are to be a gentleman.

06:06.008 --> 06:08.814
And a gentleman
ought to be in love.

06:10.584 --> 06:12.822
Don't you agree, Mr. Franklin?

06:14.158 --> 06:17.565
(chuckles) Whoo! The thought

06:17.598 --> 06:21.573
brings forth fond remembrances
of my own coming out.

06:21.606 --> 06:24.846
You would have found me
quite becoming, Rufus.

06:24.879 --> 06:28.787
Relish the opportunity
to meet one half as good
as your mother in Philippa.

06:30.992 --> 06:33.831

06:33.864 --> 06:34.967
Go on.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.741
KEVIN: Um...so, uh...

06:47.792 --> 06:49.997
LUKE: We've scoured the woods
from here to Easton.

06:50.030 --> 06:53.036
-The girl is nowhere to be
found.
-Go on.

06:58.914 --> 07:02.054
(rooster crows, dog barks)

07:02.087 --> 07:04.993
LUKE: It makes absolutely
no sense.

07:05.829 --> 07:09.001
She can't have traveled
as far on foot
in such a short time.

07:09.034 --> 07:10.871
LUKE: Nothing.

07:12.909 --> 07:15.748
-DANA: Listen, about last
night, I wasn't trying--
-The more I know,

07:15.781 --> 07:18.621
the more danger you put me in,
you hear?

07:18.654 --> 07:20.691
I'm already in enough trouble.

07:26.903 --> 07:28.774
Somethin' the
matter with Luke?

07:33.082 --> 07:36.623
I suspect it's that runaway
that happened under his watch.

07:38.660 --> 07:40.564
He know about our talk?

07:41.900 --> 07:43.871
-Do anybody?
-No.

07:43.904 --> 07:46.041
You need to keep it that way.

07:49.716 --> 07:50.851
Carrie!

07:52.855 --> 07:54.057
Come here.

07:55.093 --> 07:57.898
Take off that dress. Now.

08:02.207 --> 08:05.681
I don't care what that bitch
Margaret wants.

08:05.714 --> 08:08.954
You take it off 'fore you
step foot in this cookhouse.
You hear me?

08:18.106 --> 08:20.209
What you lookin' at?

08:20.844 --> 08:24.820
I keep Carrie in that tow
linen so she don't end up like
Celeste

08:24.853 --> 08:27.257
or any of their mothers.

08:27.290 --> 08:28.828
Last one might
have gotten away,

08:28.861 --> 08:30.865
but Carrie
ain't gonna be the next.

08:30.898 --> 08:32.100
You hear me?

08:41.853 --> 08:43.757
Knock, knock.

08:43.790 --> 08:45.961
-(door closes)
-Mr. Franklin.

08:48.299 --> 08:49.902
How goes the
search for Winnie?

08:51.272 --> 08:53.711
Yeah, we'll find her soon.

08:53.744 --> 08:56.817
She's proving herself
to be rather a canny bitch.

08:56.850 --> 08:59.856
But... I'm cannier still.

08:59.889 --> 09:02.127
I don't suppose
you have any leads?

09:06.937 --> 09:09.275
How goes Rufus's playing, hmm?

09:09.308 --> 09:13.283
Well, uh, not bad
for one day, but, uh,

09:13.316 --> 09:16.790
I feel that I should
manage your expectations.

09:16.823 --> 09:19.729
Margaret seems to think
that he'll be concert-ready
by tomorrow.

09:19.762 --> 09:21.834
Tomorrow?

09:21.867 --> 09:24.004
Oh, Christ.

09:24.037 --> 09:26.142
Deighton visits tomorrow.

09:26.175 --> 09:30.183
Unfortunately,
Kevin, a man's appointment
to the agricultural society

09:30.216 --> 09:34.257
is dependent upon that
blithering loiterer's
judgment.

09:35.159 --> 09:40.938
It doesn't help that he
considered himself betrothed
to Hannah in their youth.

09:40.971 --> 09:45.948
I do suspect
that he half believes
this estate ought to be his.

09:45.981 --> 09:50.791
I do hope you're not planning
to wear that to dinner
tomorrow.

09:51.593 --> 09:57.003
Uh, I-- I don't really
have anything else to wear.

10:00.811 --> 10:03.182
I'll have something arranged.

10:11.232 --> 10:13.804
(woman screams in distance,
rustle)

10:13.837 --> 10:17.211
(gasps and groaning)

10:17.244 --> 10:18.847
Celeste.

10:18.880 --> 10:20.952
-Let me help you.
-Thanks.

10:20.985 --> 10:24.258
-My head feels somethin'
awful. -It's really hot.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.863
You shouldn't be
exerting yourself.

10:27.331 --> 10:30.771
You don't think I know that?
Go and tell Miss Margaret.

10:32.107 --> 10:34.311
(bell ringing)

10:34.344 --> 10:37.217
Thank the Lord
for that meal bell.

10:37.250 --> 10:40.223

10:40.256 --> 10:42.227
(bell continues ringing)

10:52.848 --> 10:54.385
(bird cooing)

10:54.418 --> 10:59.094
Soon, two days will have come
and gone since Winnie's
flight.

11:00.898 --> 11:04.371
I suspect some of you
know where she went...

11:04.404 --> 11:07.144
and how she went about going.

11:07.177 --> 11:10.216
I also reason
it's in your nature to keep
mum.

11:10.249 --> 11:13.389
Maybe you don't think
it's your business, hmm?

11:13.422 --> 11:17.899
You'd rather keep
your black eyes to the ground
and wait for the supper bell.

11:17.932 --> 11:21.138
But maybe some of you
will afford me your obedience.

11:23.476 --> 11:27.885
Where has the Negress gone to?
Where?

11:31.091 --> 11:32.861
Hmm.

11:44.217 --> 11:45.855
(splatter)

11:45.888 --> 11:46.889
(gasps)

11:52.233 --> 11:57.443
A half square of cornbread a
day until the Negress is
recovered!

12:00.483 --> 12:03.289
Or until one of you comes
forward with her designs.

12:03.322 --> 12:06.295
No evening meal till then!

12:06.328 --> 12:08.165
Am I clear? Hmm?

12:09.936 --> 12:11.038
Is that clear?!

12:11.071 --> 12:12.441
-MAN: Yes, Marse.
-MAN #2: Yes.

12:12.474 --> 12:15.915
-WOMAN: Yes, sir.
-MAN: Yes.

12:15.948 --> 12:18.486
You see any of these mongrels
even think about lapping it
up,

12:18.520 --> 12:21.058
you shoot.

12:22.495 --> 12:24.397
Now back to work with you!

12:28.105 --> 12:29.474
(thudding)

12:30.176 --> 12:33.951
PETER: How long are we
expected to work off a half
square of cornbread, Luke?

12:33.984 --> 12:37.090
-We're practically starved
as it is.
-Ain't sensible.

12:37.224 --> 12:40.363
Marse Tom's liable to lose
half his stock in this heat if
we keep on with empty
stomachs.

12:40.396 --> 12:43.236
You're right, Jupe,
and Marse Tom know that.

12:43.269 --> 12:46.977
He just sore on account
of his shine for Winnie,
but he's a reasonable man.

12:47.010 --> 12:48.212
-Ugh.
-Give it the night, Peter.

12:48.245 --> 12:49.949
Master Tom gon' come
to his senses.

12:49.982 --> 12:51.520
You better hope he does.
You was the one

12:51.553 --> 12:53.957
that was supposed to be
watching out that night.

12:57.363 --> 12:59.536
Where she go off?

12:59.569 --> 13:02.140
Celeste doesn't seem
to agree with you
about Tom being reasonable.

13:02.173 --> 13:04.411
Celeste just think
I know something about Winnie.

13:04.444 --> 13:09.121
You think Tom
will really do this
if someone doesn't come
forward?

13:09.154 --> 13:11.960
No slave is supposed to leave
Tom Weylin's plantation
that way.

13:11.993 --> 13:14.331
If you ask me,

13:14.364 --> 13:16.368
it's fixin' to be
a hard few days.

13:18.272 --> 13:20.076
KEVIN: He wouldn't turn you
in, would he? Like--

13:20.109 --> 13:21.513
like if things got worse.

13:21.546 --> 13:25.120
No. I don't think so.

13:25.153 --> 13:27.424
No, this just needs
to blow over.

13:27.457 --> 13:29.294
What about Nigel or Celeste?
You know,

13:29.327 --> 13:31.165
if something
happens to them...

13:31.198 --> 13:32.968
How can we help take
the pressure off?

13:34.137 --> 13:37.410
I don't know. Uh...help him.

13:46.428 --> 13:48.500
Hmm?

14:03.229 --> 14:05.300
DANA (whispers): Luke.

14:05.333 --> 14:08.473
Dana, you shouldn't be
creeping around this late.

14:08.507 --> 14:11.613
Jake's on watch tonight.

14:11.646 --> 14:14.017
-You're not on watch?
-Not by myself.

14:14.050 --> 14:15.319
Not anymore.

14:17.223 --> 14:19.294
Look. I brought you something.

14:20.429 --> 14:22.568
-What is that?
-It's food.

14:25.306 --> 14:27.344
I promise it's good.

14:27.377 --> 14:29.582
There's enough
for Celeste and Nigel.

14:29.615 --> 14:32.588
That should hold you over
for a couple days at least.

14:32.621 --> 14:34.324
What about everyone else?

14:34.357 --> 14:37.463
I don't have enough
for everyone.

Somethin' like that.

16:03.302 --> 16:08.145
I'm jealous of you, Piano Man.
No rest for the likes of me.

Soon, Tom's gonna have me
out there looking for that
damn girl of his again.

Well, you tell me.

you don't seem too weak.

Delighted by your
acquaintance, Mrs. Weylin.

22:34.117 --> 22:38.024

Oh! (chuckling)

22:57.129 --> 22:59.835
And who might this be?

22:59.868 --> 23:04.645
My apologies.
Mr. Kevin Franklin of New
York.

23:04.879 --> 23:09.020
A very gifted musician,
and employed
as Rufus' piano tutor.

23:09.053 --> 23:11.024
-Pleasure.
-Oh, the pleasure's mine, sir.

23:11.057 --> 23:13.128
That Miss Weylin attests
to your skill

23:13.161 --> 23:15.734
is all the endorsement
a man can require.

23:15.767 --> 23:20.009
(chuckles) It does not take
an expert to observe
Mr. Franklin's talent.

23:20.042 --> 23:23.015
I do believe supper is ready.

23:23.048 --> 23:25.721
Yes, please.
I believe I remember the way.

23:25.754 --> 23:27.991
This way, dear.

23:37.911 --> 23:40.817
Don't worry.
She's just a girl.

and took a fall in the garden.

23:49.635 --> 23:51.773

-Dizzy?

23:51.806 --> 23:53.977
She's been having
aches in her head all day.

23:54.010 --> 23:56.148
-She hasn't eaten anything.
-What?

23:56.181 --> 23:59.020
Tom's been starving everyone
out looking for Winnie.

23:59.053 --> 24:02.761

coming.

contraction. Dana's gonna help
you.

-The baby's breech.

24:46.882 --> 24:49.688

What's that mean?

24:49.721 --> 24:53.028
(Celeste gasping)

24:53.061 --> 24:56.068
What's that mean?! (panting)

-ARCHIBALD: Mmm.

Mr. Weylin,
the rumors prove true.

25:05.753 --> 25:08.092
Sarah has grown
into a fine cook.

25:08.125 --> 25:11.866
Do the grounds stand up
to your memory, Mr. Deighton?

25:11.899 --> 25:15.272
I regard my time here
with the warmest of sentiment.

25:15.305 --> 25:20.216
The late Miss Hannah and I
used to run unfettered
beneath the low oak branches.

25:20.249 --> 25:23.823
When I was good and worn out,
Father would sit me
on his lap...

25:23.856 --> 25:25.927
(stomach gurgles)

25:27.764 --> 25:31.739
...tell me stories

-since those salad days.
-(stomach gurgles)

25:49.307 --> 25:51.812
-TOM: Enough.
-I'm sorry, Marse.

25:52.747 --> 25:54.751
Out.

25:56.054 --> 25:56.755
Carrie, you will
take over the service.

26:00.295 --> 26:02.901
(pouring water)

26:02.934 --> 26:04.905
Very good.

26:04.938 --> 26:07.878
Is everything all right
with your girl, Tom?

26:07.911 --> 26:10.249
Yes, yes. It's just...

26:10.282 --> 26:15.025
you've caught us in a period
of, uh, disciplinary action.

26:15.058 --> 26:16.896
What was the cause
of the discipline?

26:16.929 --> 26:19.166
They don't want
to give up a runaway.

26:20.235 --> 26:23.342
I see. That's a shame.

26:23.375 --> 26:25.814
It will be sorted soon enough.

26:25.847 --> 26:27.884
I'm sure of it.

26:31.825 --> 26:33.128

26:38.104 --> 26:40.877
Okay. Good job.

26:40.910 --> 26:42.748
-You're doing so good.
-OLIVIA: Okay, Dana.

26:42.781 --> 26:44.250
-Good job.
-Now I'm gonna rotate the
head.

26:47.991 --> 26:50.029
Okay.

26:50.062 --> 26:52.233
(gasping)

26:52.266 --> 26:54.871
I got the baby
in a good position.

26:56.107 --> 26:58.045
DANA: It's okay.

26:58.078 --> 27:00.349
-Just a little bit more, okay?
-I'm sorry, I can't.

27:00.382 --> 27:02.119
You're about to
meet your baby.

27:02.152 --> 27:03.990
You're doing so good.
You're so close.

27:04.023 --> 27:06.027
You're so close.
You're about to meet your
baby.

27:06.060 --> 27:08.098
Here comes another
contraction.

27:08.131 --> 27:10.069
-Okay.

27:10.102 --> 27:11.338
Okay.

27:11.371 --> 27:15.212
(strained groaning, gurgling)

27:15.245 --> 27:17.784
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
What's happening?

27:17.817 --> 27:20.857
-(choking sounds)
-She's seizing. She's seizing.

27:20.890 --> 27:22.961
Grab that strap over there.

27:22.994 --> 27:24.163
I don't want her
biting her tongue.

27:25.098 --> 27:26.802

27:26.835 --> 27:28.005
Celeste. Hey.

27:28.038 --> 27:30.810

27:30.843 --> 27:33.015
Hey. Hey.

that you could.

34:15.285 --> 34:17.524
Look at all this suffering.

34:17.557 --> 34:21.632
But people here choose
survival for its own sake.

34:21.665 --> 34:24.369
They have to.

34:26.374 --> 34:29.681
When you appeared
in the nursery...

34:29.714 --> 34:33.823
and you came back
after the fire,

34:33.856 --> 34:36.661
even when you went back
that same night,
I held on to you.

34:39.400 --> 34:42.540
Because I was holding on
to an old version of myself.

34:46.615 --> 34:49.286
It's hard to look at you.

34:49.319 --> 34:51.624
You have your father's face.

could be put back together.

nearly killed me.

46:34.997 --> 46:36.099
Oh, my God, Dana.

46:47.556 --> 46:49.961
I don't know what to say.

46:49.994 --> 46:52.265
There's nothing to say.

46:52.298 --> 46:55.137
Luke's out there digging a
grave for both of them...

46:57.341 --> 46:59.011
...by himself.

47:00.481 --> 47:03.019
And it wasn't even his kid.
It was Tom's.

47:06.026 --> 47:09.132
I told Luke that
I'd teach Nigel to read.

47:09.165 --> 47:10.535
It's the least I could do.

47:14.275 --> 47:16.280
-Dana--
-I know it's dangerous,

47:16.313 --> 47:19.453
but he's wrecked.

47:19.486 --> 47:21.190
And I have to do something.

47:21.223 --> 47:23.060
No.

47:23.093 --> 47:25.130
You're not seeing
what I'm seeing every day.

47:26.233 --> 47:29.105
-I know that.
-Do you?

47:38.457 --> 47:40.428
I just need you
to be safe, Dana.

47:40.461 --> 47:44.002
I don't think it's enough
for me to be safe.

47:44.035 --> 47:46.340
When I'm not safe,
I get to go home.

47:46.373 --> 47:49.445
These people, they don't--
they don't get that.

47:51.116 --> 47:52.051
And I...

47:54.355 --> 47:57.328
I can't help but feel
like somehow this is...

47:59.533 --> 48:01.269
...my fault.

48:07.649 --> 48:09.285
No.

48:17.536 --> 48:20.073
-(kisses)
-(clatter in distance)

48:35.572 --> 48:38.176
-(door creaks opens)
-Margaret.
