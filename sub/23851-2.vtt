WEBVTT

00:07.000 --> 00:08.600
And right in front of her son.

00:09.520 --> 00:12.280
I heard that there was blood
all over her new drapes.

00:12.440 --> 00:13.840
What a shame.

00:14.960 --> 00:17.360
Those drapes must have
cost her a fortune.

00:18.520 --> 00:19.840
Pâté?

00:20.000 --> 00:21.840
How do you get blood out of drapes?

00:22.000 --> 00:24.920
I think it's hairspray.
No, wait, I think that's ink.

00:26.440 --> 00:28.200
Don't knock me out again, Veronica.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074

01:34.440 --> 01:36.800
Oh, this one is so sad.

01:36.960 --> 01:40.760
"I'll never forget
how kind Heather was", from...

01:40.920 --> 01:43.040
Briana Parker.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.200
Trailer Parker.

01:45.360 --> 01:48.680
Heather made fun of her every day
for being totally Hamburger Helpless.

01:48.840 --> 01:50.200
Wait.

01:51.400 --> 01:54.080
"My thoughts and prayers
are with Heather Chandler's family",

01:54.240 --> 01:55.960
from Ram?

01:56.120 --> 02:00.240
"Sending messages of love".
Jesus Julie. God.

02:00.400 --> 02:03.600
This is what we get
for trying to save Westerburg?

02:03.760 --> 02:07.040
We should have known.
People are so predictable.

02:07.200 --> 02:11.160
It's like, celebrity of the week dies.
Let me post about

02:11.320 --> 02:15.680
how truly devastated I am about
the tragic loss of Robin Williams.

02:15.840 --> 02:19.160
<i>Flubber </i> was
a very formative film for me.

02:19.320 --> 02:22.040
Up next on the American
carousel of tragedy,

02:22.200 --> 02:23.880
another poor black kid gets shot.

02:24.040 --> 02:27.400
Let me insert myself into
this incredibly complex racial issue.

02:27.560 --> 02:29.640
Not because I actually give a shit,

02:29.800 --> 02:32.000
but just so I can help define who I am.

02:32.160 --> 02:35.560
And now, Westerburg's
very own Heather Chandler dies.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.960
God, I hope I can find
a pic of us together

02:38.120 --> 02:41.080
so I can rack up on some sympathy likes.

02:42.680 --> 02:44.280
People will find any way

02:44.440 --> 02:46.720
to make someone else's tragedy
just another plot twist

02:46.880 --> 02:48.640
in their very own grief opera.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.560
Well, maybe we're just being too harsh.

02:56.320 --> 02:58.680
Maybe some of them
actually cared about Heather.

02:58.840 --> 03:02.280
Regardless,
Heather got what she deserved.

03:02.440 --> 03:06.320
JD, you might not have seen it,
but Heather was my friend.

03:07.440 --> 03:09.080
You hated her.

03:09.240 --> 03:12.360
I hate all my friends.
That doesn't mean I want them dead.

03:12.520 --> 03:15.680
-So why did you do it, then?
-I didn't do anything, JD.

03:15.840 --> 03:17.720
And you know it.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.320
You're right, I'm sorry.

03:21.680 --> 03:23.400
We did something.

03:24.840 --> 03:27.640
We killed Heather, Veronica.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.280
Together.

03:50.960 --> 03:53.280
Oh, my God! Heather.

03:54.400 --> 03:58.440
I just... I just...
I just saw her!

03:58.600 --> 04:00.520
Heather's dead.

04:00.680 --> 04:04.840
No. I just... I saw her.

04:06.320 --> 04:08.520
Babe, I think you're just
a little stressed out.

04:08.680 --> 04:11.720
We both saw Heather die
with our own eyes.

04:13.440 --> 04:15.880
Maybe you should go home
and get some rest.

04:16.040 --> 04:17.560
Yeah?

04:17.720 --> 04:20.800
No. I'm fine, I'm just...

04:21.880 --> 04:23.440
Just stressed out.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.800
Veronica. Hey.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.000
I care about you.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.320
Go home and get a good night's sleep.

04:33.080 --> 04:37.200
Okay. I mean... You're right.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.280
Shit.

06:05.480 --> 06:07.080
Veronica.

06:32.480 --> 06:33.800
Hello, Veronica.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.760
JD.

06:48.920 --> 06:51.040
Heather's alive!

06:51.200 --> 06:52.560
It's true.

06:52.720 --> 06:55.160
Last night I attempted suicide.

06:55.320 --> 06:57.880
I know, it's cliché, but...

06:58.040 --> 07:01.400
we all end up
in a dark place sometimes, and...

07:01.560 --> 07:04.920
I just needed to be with my best friend.

07:05.080 --> 07:06.400
Veronica.

07:07.720 --> 07:10.480
No, JD. Isn't that great?

07:10.640 --> 07:12.320
Heather's alive. It's like...

07:12.480 --> 07:14.360
It's like nothing ever happened.

07:15.760 --> 07:17.920
Do you want to know
really what happened?

07:19.760 --> 07:21.680
I found these old pills.

07:22.600 --> 07:25.560
Poison pills, like from
a fairytale or something.

07:26.600 --> 07:30.200
I can't for the life of me remember
who gave them to me, but...

07:30.360 --> 07:35.000
there they were in my hour
of suicidal desperation.

07:35.160 --> 07:38.360
So, I dropped one into a bag
of Corn Nuts, and then...

07:38.520 --> 07:39.920
Smash.

07:40.920 --> 07:44.600
Landed face-first in my beautiful,

07:44.760 --> 07:46.680
all glass coffee table.

07:49.240 --> 07:50.920
But then a miracle happened.

07:52.440 --> 07:54.160
The poison pill didn't break.

07:55.680 --> 07:59.600
When I finally came to,
I threw up and there it was,

07:59.760 --> 08:02.080
completely intact.

08:02.240 --> 08:05.160
And then when I read
all the media reports,

08:05.320 --> 08:09.280
literally millions of
people all over the world

08:09.440 --> 08:11.040
moved by my journey...

08:12.080 --> 08:15.360
I realized that this happened
to me for a reason.

08:15.520 --> 08:18.640
So that I, Heather Chandler,

08:18.800 --> 08:21.000
could be the new face of suicide.

08:23.680 --> 08:26.000
And you two are going
to help me with that.

08:26.160 --> 08:28.120
Whenever I want.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.080
I miss Heather.

08:36.240 --> 08:39.280
The last thing she told me was
that I couldn't pull off leggings.

08:39.440 --> 08:40.760
She was right.

08:41.720 --> 08:43.960
Oh, God. I just thought of something.

08:44.120 --> 08:46.120
Oh, Heather, I doubt it.

08:46.280 --> 08:50.200
Anyways, what were Heather Chandler's
last words to you, Veronica?

08:56.000 --> 08:58.280
-Veronica.
-Hey, Betty.

08:58.440 --> 09:01.560
-See, he is in the girls' bathroom.
-It's Heather.

09:01.720 --> 09:03.080
Does it say Heather
on your birth certificate?

09:03.240 --> 09:05.160
Does it say
"aborted queef weasel" on yours?

09:05.320 --> 09:07.160
Guys, come on, it's just Heather.

09:07.320 --> 09:09.640
Maybe I can help.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.880
Heather, I'm sure you understand

09:12.040 --> 09:14.480
what it's like out there for women
in this day and age.

09:14.640 --> 09:16.760
We need safe spaces, and...

09:16.920 --> 09:19.040
the girls just don't feel
safe with men around.

09:19.200 --> 09:22.160
I don't feel safe with these twisty
fingered clit witches around.

09:22.320 --> 09:27.040
-Come on, Heather.
-Actually, I think I'm going to stay.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.480
Heather, let's step into your office.

09:33.440 --> 09:36.200
Are you really choosing these
discount hobgoblins over me?

09:36.360 --> 09:39.160
Maybe they'll actually
treat me with respect.

09:39.320 --> 09:41.760
I gave you three of my old Swatches.

09:41.920 --> 09:44.240
Sorry, Heath... er.

09:44.400 --> 09:47.080
The winds of friendship have changed.

09:47.240 --> 09:48.560
Nothing personal.

09:54.360 --> 09:55.920
Have fun with your new friends, Heather.

09:57.400 --> 09:59.080
What a trash porch.

10:00.040 --> 10:01.440
Come on, Veronica, let's get lunch?

10:01.600 --> 10:04.240
I just...
I told JD I'd meet up with him.

10:05.240 --> 10:06.880
You too, Veronica.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.480
Feed the Washington Indians.

10:13.640 --> 10:15.480
This are their sacred mounds.

10:15.640 --> 10:17.760
Take a tomahawk to their babies,

10:17.920 --> 10:19.480
and burn their teepees to the ground.

10:19.640 --> 10:21.160
So, you kill one weed,

10:21.320 --> 10:24.360
and an even bigger weed
pops back up in its place.

10:27.560 --> 10:31.600
So, we were actually better off
with Heather in charge, JD.

10:31.760 --> 10:33.600
Heather's a monster, Veronica.

10:33.760 --> 10:36.560
Yeah, but at least she is
a monster about the right things.

10:36.720 --> 10:39.240
We're better off without
any monsters at all.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.320
Hey, Betty.

10:44.480 --> 10:45.800
Heather.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.440
Can I sit with you guys?

10:47.600 --> 10:50.040
You heard I'm not
a lesbian anymore, right?

10:50.200 --> 10:52.880
Heather, I would never care
about something like that.

10:53.040 --> 10:54.920
I accept everyone at Westerburg.

10:56.080 --> 10:59.200
Except if they sleep with teachers.

10:59.360 --> 11:01.400
Actually, Heather,
now that I think about it,

11:01.560 --> 11:04.120
you're underage
and slept with a teacher,

11:04.280 --> 11:08.000
which means you basically
enabled a pedophile.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.480
Yeah, you come sit here.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.920
I'm sorry, Heather.

11:16.080 --> 11:17.760
The slut table is over there.

11:25.240 --> 11:28.240
Can you believe that she thought
she could sit here?

11:34.600 --> 11:36.240
Sorry, Heather.

11:36.400 --> 11:39.240
There's already a dirty old bag
in that seat.

11:40.720 --> 11:42.240
You made your choice.

11:44.520 --> 11:47.320
Maybe Trailer Parker
will let you sit by her.

12:09.480 --> 12:12.640
<i>Heather McNamara and Mr. Waters</i>
<i>to the office.</i>

12:12.800 --> 12:16.640
<i>Heather McNamara and Mr. Waters</i>
<i>to the office, please.</i>

12:23.440 --> 12:26.760
So, this Heather McNamara
here is a student?

12:26.920 --> 12:28.480
Yes, 17-year-old student.

12:28.640 --> 12:31.560
-Well, she looks like a grown woman.
-Thank you.

12:31.720 --> 12:34.840
Heather, please.
Let me handle this, okay?

12:35.000 --> 12:37.640
She's not a grown woman,
she is a child.

12:37.800 --> 12:41.600
A child who's obviously
been taken advantage of by David.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.560
This girl slept with David?

12:43.720 --> 12:45.080
Why?

12:45.240 --> 12:47.160
I don't know if it's that unbelievable.

12:47.320 --> 12:49.720
-So, you admit it.
-I'm not saying anything happened.

12:49.880 --> 12:51.200
-Rude!
-Heather.

12:51.360 --> 12:52.760
But if something did happen,

12:52.920 --> 12:54.880
Heather would have been
the one taking advantage of me.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.720
Actually, I could explain everything.

12:57.880 --> 13:01.000
Heather, we can't get to the bottom
of what happened

13:01.160 --> 13:03.200
if you keep trying to speak.

13:03.360 --> 13:05.400
Now. You know...

13:06.800 --> 13:09.240
-Oh, my God.
-Here we go.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.560
Isn't this just
how the patriarchy works?

13:11.720 --> 13:13.880
As someone who's been
on the receiving end

13:14.040 --> 13:15.760
of the lecherous male gaze,

13:15.920 --> 13:17.720
-many times in my life...
-Oh, honey.

13:17.880 --> 13:22.040
I have to say it is really rich to hear
you blame the victim, David.

13:22.200 --> 13:25.080
It's called victim-shaming
and it is textbook misogyny.

13:25.240 --> 13:27.360
Actually, you're the misogynist,
Pauline.

13:27.520 --> 13:29.720
How am I the misogynist?
I would love to hear this one.

13:29.880 --> 13:32.120
To claim that Heather
isn't capable of fabricating

13:32.280 --> 13:36.080
that she had a relationship with a man
just because she's a girl?

13:36.240 --> 13:38.080
That sounds anti-woman to me.

13:38.240 --> 13:40.680
-It does sound anti-woman, Pauline.
-You're an anti-woman.

13:40.840 --> 13:44.400
Principal Gowan, he can obfuscate
with his lies all he wants,

13:44.560 --> 13:49.160
but the proof is right there
in that giant, blown-up photograph.

13:49.320 --> 13:51.760
-That could be anyone.
-For crying out loud.

13:51.920 --> 13:54.760
Photoshop. Anyone can use
Photoshop these days.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.680
I don't think I would know
how to use Photoshop.

13:56.840 --> 13:59.440
David's right. The kids these
days are eating those drugs

13:59.600 --> 14:01.600
and running that Photoshop
high as a kite.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.360
Why are you even here, Maurice?

14:03.520 --> 14:06.680
Well, Pauline, if you must know,
I'm just here for the drama.

14:06.840 --> 14:09.000
And to be honest, you straight
people have once again

14:09.160 --> 14:10.680
disappointed me in that arena.

14:10.840 --> 14:12.840
So now it's okay to openly
mock straight people.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.480
Honestly, how about be more interesting.

14:14.640 --> 14:17.120
We have to stay focused on the topic.

14:17.280 --> 14:18.840
Who are you right now? I know who I am.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.160
All right, quiet.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.160
Oh, my God, rich.

14:25.760 --> 14:27.080
David is right.

14:27.240 --> 14:30.240
With all the Photoshops
and drug eating going on,

14:30.400 --> 14:32.000
this could be of anyone.

14:32.960 --> 14:34.520
Thank you, Principal Gowan.

14:35.520 --> 14:36.920
Watch your step, Waters.

14:37.080 --> 14:39.160
One more girl comes forward
and you're out.

14:53.240 --> 14:54.760
<i>"Dear Diary...</i>

14:57.240 --> 14:59.800
<i>If I'm a good person</i>
<i>who just did a bad thing,</i>

14:59.960 --> 15:02.640
<i>but turns out</i>
<i>I failed at that bad thing,</i>

15:04.280 --> 15:06.040
<i>then I'm still a good person, right?</i>

15:07.680 --> 15:10.560
God, Veronica. Can you please
get off the spectrum for once

15:10.720 --> 15:12.240
and help me pass these out?

15:13.120 --> 15:14.440
What are those, Heather?

15:14.600 --> 15:17.160
I'm throwing a Heather Chandler
mourning party tonight at my house.

15:17.320 --> 15:20.000
Maybe we could just give all this
mourning a rest for a second?

15:20.160 --> 15:22.040
It's all becoming so Mary Todd Lincoln.

15:22.200 --> 15:25.720
Veronica... our best
friend is dead.

15:26.520 --> 15:28.440
I think she'd want us to make
sure that everyone at Westerburg

15:28.600 --> 15:30.840
is appropriately devastated.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.640
And if her mourning party
has the additional benefit

15:32.800 --> 15:34.840
of putting me back on top,
then so be it.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.560
Come on.

15:37.680 --> 15:39.480
Mourning party at my house tonight.

15:39.640 --> 15:43.520
Make sure you've done all you
can do to mourn Heather.

15:43.680 --> 15:45.280
She's watching.

15:45.440 --> 15:46.920
Heather C. mourning party.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.880
Nerds, this is your one chance
to finally attend a party

15:49.040 --> 15:50.400
your mom doesn't cater.

15:52.320 --> 15:53.640
Are you going?

15:53.800 --> 15:55.320
You kidding me,
with these thunder thighs?

15:55.480 --> 15:57.560
I swear, if I don't get
a thigh gap before prom

15:57.720 --> 15:59.760
I'm going to kill myself.

15:59.920 --> 16:01.600
Everyone's talking about
Heather Duke's mourning party.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.080
I can't believe we got invited.

16:03.240 --> 16:06.840
Heather Chandler killing herself is the
best thing that's ever happened to us.

16:09.680 --> 16:11.920
Be the bigger person.
Invite Heather, Heather.

16:13.520 --> 16:14.840
Fine.

16:16.160 --> 16:17.600
You can come, Heather.

16:17.760 --> 16:19.800
But you can't eat anything
and bring a trash bag to sit on.

16:25.120 --> 16:26.840
Look at them.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.280
My loyal subjects.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.680
Can you believe Betty Finn
thought Westerburg would choose

16:31.840 --> 16:33.280
Michelle Williams from Destiny's Child

16:33.440 --> 16:36.320
over Michelle Williams
from Heath Ledger's death?

16:36.480 --> 16:37.960
No.

16:38.120 --> 16:40.080
Westerburg wants glamour.

16:40.240 --> 16:42.560
Westerburg wants aspiration.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.720
Westerburg wants majesty.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.640
Westerburg wants me.

16:47.800 --> 16:50.840
And tonight,
I'm going to let them eat cake.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.520
Isn't it just?

17:35.800 --> 17:37.560
That deep-fried lobster baby.

17:50.680 --> 17:52.880
-You did this to me.
-Mr. Waters, I'm sorry.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.480
You got me fired, Heather.

17:54.640 --> 17:57.760
But the principal said you couldn't
get fired unless there were other girls.

17:59.640 --> 18:01.560
Oh, my God.

18:01.720 --> 18:03.320
You cheated on me?

18:03.480 --> 18:05.600
-With ugly girls?
-Goodbye, Heather.

18:05.760 --> 18:08.440
Am I to understand
that your type is mud ducks?

18:08.600 --> 18:10.400
Heather, it's over.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.080
Okay? You've ruined my life.

18:12.240 --> 18:15.000
I have no job.
I have to register as a sex offender.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.840
I'm probably going to have
to sell my Tercel.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.320
Driffany Tompkins?

18:18.480 --> 18:22.280
She looks like if Jim Henson got in
one last puppet before he died.

18:22.440 --> 18:25.760
Stop being so shallow and think about
how your words are hurting me.

18:26.840 --> 18:28.920
I'm sorry, I just...

18:30.440 --> 18:34.080
I just think I actually
had feelings for you.

18:34.240 --> 18:36.680
And those feelings got you in trouble.

18:36.840 --> 18:39.480
Look, you've already ruined me.
The damage is done.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.280
I just hope the next time
you have feelings,

18:41.440 --> 18:44.640
you take it out on yourself
instead of an innocent bystander.

18:52.240 --> 18:54.520
He used the same lines on me.

19:09.040 --> 19:11.200
Well, I got everything you asked for.

19:11.360 --> 19:13.320
Corn Nuts, hemorrhoid cream,

19:13.480 --> 19:16.320
adult diapers and extra-small condoms.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.800
I can't believe
you actually fell for that.

19:19.960 --> 19:22.240
God, Veronica,
you're such a Jacuzzi turd.

19:22.400 --> 19:26.000
Just throw all that in the trash along
with that horrible belt you're wearing.

19:30.640 --> 19:32.640
So...

19:32.800 --> 19:34.600
Did you bring me what I really wanted?

19:35.640 --> 19:37.000
See?

19:37.160 --> 19:39.520
People were devastated. Happy?

19:40.480 --> 19:42.960
Crying, good. Crying, good.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.800
Her crying looks forced.

19:44.960 --> 19:47.120
I wish they had sprung
for better flowers, like...

19:48.080 --> 19:49.400
Hold on.

19:49.560 --> 19:52.640
Is Shelby Dunstock... texting

19:52.800 --> 19:54.280
during my grieving period?

19:54.440 --> 19:58.440
And is Dylen Lutz wearing white
on the day after my death?

19:58.600 --> 20:00.000
Heather, that's just one pic.

20:00.160 --> 20:03.040
I promise,
people were really devastated.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.520
How devastated?

20:04.680 --> 20:07.000
Oh, my God,
do we really have to do this?

20:07.160 --> 20:09.680
Veronica, I've got big plans
for my return to Westerburg.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.600
I'm going to help these sad,

20:11.760 --> 20:13.680
unfortunate roller backpacks, okay?

20:13.840 --> 20:17.400
But in order to do that,
I need to feel appreciated.

20:17.560 --> 20:21.480
I need to feel that my struggles
were worth it.

20:21.640 --> 20:24.560
So yes, we need to do this.

20:24.720 --> 20:28.120
Actually, you'll be doing
most of the work.

20:28.280 --> 20:30.040
Considering our deal.

20:51.640 --> 20:53.160
Heather?

20:55.200 --> 20:57.800
-Your mother and I are concerned.
-Very concerned.

20:57.960 --> 21:01.080
-We'd like to talk.
-We'd like to ask you some questions.

21:01.240 --> 21:03.280
-In light of Heather's suicide...
-Her death.

21:03.440 --> 21:04.760
Are you feeling suicidal?

21:04.920 --> 21:06.400
-Thoughts of suicide?
-Suicidal thoughts?

21:07.760 --> 21:09.080
-No.
-You sure?

21:09.240 --> 21:10.600
You must have at least thought about it.

21:10.760 --> 21:13.920
-Once or twice?
-No, not really.

21:14.080 --> 21:15.680
Because having a close friend
commit suicide,

21:15.840 --> 21:18.520
that's one of the triggers
that can lead to further suicides.

21:18.680 --> 21:21.080
-As is ending a relationship.
-With an older man.

21:21.240 --> 21:23.120
Not to mention losing your friends.

21:23.280 --> 21:25.600
Heather Duke left you a note today.

21:25.760 --> 21:28.920
It says, "Die, you rusted bitch".

21:29.080 --> 21:31.800
What did you do to Heather to make
him or her write such a thing?

21:31.960 --> 21:33.800
-Because...
-Heather.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.360
Let your mother finish.

21:35.520 --> 21:38.120
Heather, all I'm saying,

21:38.280 --> 21:40.880
is that your father and I
are very concerned.

21:41.040 --> 21:44.400
If anyone has a reason
to kill themselves, it's you.

21:44.560 --> 21:46.200
Your best friend just died.

21:46.360 --> 21:47.760
Your remaining friends
have turned on you,

21:47.920 --> 21:50.320
the teacher you were sleeping with
was fired,

21:50.480 --> 21:52.920
and everyone knows that...

21:53.080 --> 21:55.280
you lied about being a lesbian.

21:56.440 --> 22:00.400
Heather, when you look
at the whole picture...

22:00.560 --> 22:02.560
The picture as a whole.

22:02.720 --> 22:05.400
It's almost like you have nothing
to live for.

22:05.560 --> 22:06.880
Nothing at all.

22:07.040 --> 22:09.520
So, we just wanted to come in here,

22:09.680 --> 22:12.080
and say we see you.

22:13.480 --> 22:15.920
We see you.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.120
We see you.

22:25.520 --> 22:26.840
So, we see you.

22:28.360 --> 22:29.760
Okay.

22:29.920 --> 22:32.960
-Nicely done. I think she felt seen.
-Yeah, I looked right at her.

22:33.120 --> 22:36.320
-I noticed that too. Good eye contact.
-Thank you.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.480
Jade...

23:01.640 --> 23:04.880
Can you please not smoke
your whore cigarettes in the house?

23:05.040 --> 23:06.360
I have company coming.

23:06.520 --> 23:10.480
Doesn't look like anyone's coming
to your little party to me, Heather.

23:10.640 --> 23:11.960
People are coming.

23:12.120 --> 23:14.120
They're just what's called
fashionably late.

23:16.200 --> 23:18.800
"Fashionably" is a word
you know nothing about.

23:18.960 --> 23:21.840
And "late" is a word
you know all too well.

23:22.000 --> 23:27.080
Shame none of those handsome boys
from the football team came.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.200
I was gonna let you all drink.

23:29.360 --> 23:32.000
You don't let me do anything.
You're not my mother.

23:32.160 --> 23:34.280
And furthermore,
as soon as Dad wakes up,

23:34.440 --> 23:38.120
I'm going to tell him that you've been
back at Rendevous every night,

23:38.280 --> 23:40.560
and then he'll divorce you
and I'll get everything.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.840
Heather, I see what this is.

23:44.880 --> 23:47.720
You're acting out because
your fat friend killed herself.

23:47.880 --> 23:49.880
So, as your stepmother,

23:50.040 --> 23:52.520
I would like to give you
a piece of advice

23:52.680 --> 23:55.920
that has served me well in my life.

23:56.920 --> 23:58.440
Fuck it all and get that money.

24:01.320 --> 24:03.080
But not this money.

24:04.840 --> 24:06.160
Because I already got that.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.840
Company's here.

24:33.600 --> 24:36.000
Feeling so engorged right now.

24:39.680 --> 24:41.600
<i>Westerburg.</i>

24:41.760 --> 24:44.360
<i>No quarter drinks on the rink.</i>
<i>Now let's roll!</i>

25:16.880 --> 25:18.320
Veronica.

25:18.480 --> 25:20.120
So glad you made it.

25:20.280 --> 25:21.720
Pretzel?

25:25.280 --> 25:27.880
I know how hard Heather's
death has been on you.

25:28.040 --> 25:30.480
It's quite the turn-out, Betty.

25:31.320 --> 25:33.720
I just want to give the people
space to heal.

25:34.760 --> 25:38.240
Such a shocking turn
in popularity, Betty.

25:38.400 --> 25:39.880
You must be really proud.

25:40.920 --> 25:42.680
It's not about me.

25:42.840 --> 25:44.400
Westerburg was already
crying out for change,

25:44.560 --> 25:47.200
and I just happened to be
the one to give it to them.

25:48.920 --> 25:50.800
Well, lucky us.

25:52.640 --> 25:56.760
I know you were a Heather,
but you and I also go way back,

25:56.920 --> 26:00.360
so I wanted to offer you
a seat at the new table.

26:00.520 --> 26:02.280
Thanks, Betty.

26:03.720 --> 26:06.760
I'm just going to give obscurity
a try for a little while though.

26:08.040 --> 26:09.560
Suit yourself.

26:12.200 --> 26:14.240
Another chapter in the on-going mystery

26:14.400 --> 26:17.320
of why does Veronica
Sawyer hang out with her?

26:17.480 --> 26:18.960
Betty's not so bad.

26:19.120 --> 26:21.520
She's just always been kind of a nerd.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.640
Just let her have her moment in the sun.

26:23.800 --> 26:26.320
Her moment in the sun
is giving everyone skin cancer.

26:28.600 --> 26:30.040
Plus, we have history.

26:31.920 --> 26:35.360
Do I get to peel off another layer
of the onion that is Veronica Sawyer?

26:35.520 --> 26:37.240
No.

26:37.400 --> 26:39.800
You know you can
tell me anything, right?

26:39.960 --> 26:43.000
There is absolutely nothing
in that deep, dark journal

26:43.160 --> 26:46.240
you keep locked away from
everyone else that would make me think

26:46.400 --> 26:51.360
every planet and the sun doesn't revolve
around Veronica Sawyer.

26:52.960 --> 26:55.360
Okay. But let's skate.

26:57.640 --> 27:01.880
It was springtime and I remember
that our moms looked so pretty.

27:03.160 --> 27:05.440
Just sitting there, talking.

27:05.600 --> 27:07.120
Drinking lemonade.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.600
Everything seemed so perfect.

27:14.680 --> 27:17.800
<i>And then I knocked Betty's</i>
<i>croquet ball into the woods.</i>

27:17.960 --> 27:22.240
<i>I guess I hit it pretty far because</i>
<i>it felt like we were running forever.</i>

27:24.760 --> 27:26.960
<i>And just before we got to the creek,</i>

27:28.160 --> 27:29.480
<i>we saw her.</i>

27:30.680 --> 27:32.680
<i>It was our best friend, Lucy.</i>

27:40.000 --> 27:42.760
That was a big scandal at the time.

27:42.920 --> 27:46.560
Everybody in the state was looking
for the Croquet Killer for months.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.720
Then some girl fell down a well
in Winesburg or something, and...

27:51.920 --> 27:53.240
everybody moved on.

27:54.400 --> 27:56.600
So, the killer's still out there?

27:56.760 --> 27:59.480
All right, Westerburg!

27:59.640 --> 28:02.760
Give it up for your girl, Betty Finn!

28:22.760 --> 28:27.560
Westerburg... who misses
Heather Chandler?

28:29.360 --> 28:31.600
I can't hear you!

28:38.560 --> 28:40.000
That's better.

28:40.160 --> 28:41.920
If Heather Chandler were here today,

28:42.080 --> 28:44.800
she would be so floored
by the outpouring of support

28:44.960 --> 28:46.720
from everyone at Westerburg.

28:46.880 --> 28:49.280
So, let's give ourselves
a round of applause,

28:49.440 --> 28:52.600
because we have
truly mourned her so hard!

28:54.040 --> 28:55.920
Feed the Washington Indians.

28:56.080 --> 28:57.560
This are their sacred mounds.

28:57.720 --> 28:59.440
Take a tomahawk to their babies...

28:59.600 --> 29:02.840
Okay, quiet down.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.600
Now, I think we all know what
Heather would want most.

29:06.760 --> 29:09.000
For us to move on.

29:09.160 --> 29:13.440
Because her time is over,
and our time has just begun.

29:17.840 --> 29:22.360
Westerburg, I have a very
special announcement to make.

29:22.520 --> 29:24.400
I have spoken to Principal Gowan,

29:24.560 --> 29:28.240
and he has agreed to let
me pick this year's

29:28.400 --> 29:31.520
Westerburg High School prom theme.

29:34.440 --> 29:38.560
Ladies and gentlemen...
Okay, like that...

29:38.720 --> 29:40.720
Back to Basics!

29:40.880 --> 29:43.200
Yeah!

29:44.440 --> 29:47.120
Because after all that's happened,

29:47.280 --> 29:50.160
we need to get back to
what makes Westerburg...

31:14.560 --> 31:16.480
Thank you, Betty.

31:16.640 --> 31:19.040
-But...
-Your services are no longer needed.

31:19.200 --> 31:20.520
Thank you.

31:22.440 --> 31:24.640
Just go ahead and take this with you.

31:29.400 --> 31:31.560
Hello, Westerburg.

31:31.720 --> 31:34.360
I'm sure you probably
have a lot of questions.

31:35.440 --> 31:37.560
Yes. It's me.

31:38.720 --> 31:40.880
Yes. I'm alive.

31:41.840 --> 31:44.760
And yes... I forgive you.

31:45.760 --> 31:48.760
Which is why I want to
offer myself up to you

31:48.920 --> 31:51.040
as a beacon of hope.

31:51.840 --> 31:56.240
To guide you to what I now know is true.

31:57.800 --> 31:59.680
Life isn't about being popular.

32:00.760 --> 32:05.880
It's about helping people who are
less fortunate than you, like you all.

32:06.040 --> 32:09.400
Which is why I plan to become...

32:09.560 --> 32:12.280
the new face of suicide.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.440
Whenever someone
at Westerburg is in pain,

32:26.600 --> 32:27.920
I'll be there.

32:29.240 --> 32:32.960
Whenever someone is being bullied,
I'll be there.

32:34.120 --> 32:37.680
And whenever someone just
needs a shoulder to cry on,

32:39.400 --> 32:41.600
I will be there.

32:46.120 --> 32:48.400
She's alive, yo.
Let's get back in the mix.

33:13.960 --> 33:15.360
And we're moving.

33:17.160 --> 33:20.200
I'm so glad
you came back to life, Heather.

33:20.360 --> 33:23.360
Honestly, I was in a really dark place
without you,

33:23.520 --> 33:27.200
but now that you're back,
everything's going to be okay.

33:28.320 --> 33:29.640
Is it, Heather?

33:31.800 --> 33:33.960
Heather told me you tried to sit
at Betty's table when I was gone.

33:35.160 --> 33:37.600
-But, I...
-You're a traitor, Heather.

33:37.760 --> 33:41.560
And worse,
you lied about being a lesbian.

33:41.720 --> 33:44.240
You know that's a hate crime,
right, Heather?

33:48.560 --> 33:51.600
Monday morning,
don't drive your car to school.

33:51.760 --> 33:53.920
Don't call a cab.

33:54.080 --> 33:56.080
Don't ride a bike.

33:56.240 --> 33:58.200
Take the bus.

33:58.360 --> 34:00.680
Because that's what
you are now, Heather.

34:00.840 --> 34:03.040
Bus trash.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.880
Not paper, not plastic.

34:06.040 --> 34:10.320
Just worthless, discarded bus trash.

34:20.960 --> 34:22.719
Have fun on the bus, Heather.

34:22.880 --> 34:25.239
You always did think yellow
was your color.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.520
Hey, y'all...

34:43.679 --> 34:45.960
if any of you kids
out there feel alone...

34:48.080 --> 34:51.520
feel like no one in this big,
bad world is listening to you...

34:52.600 --> 34:54.120
and you're feeling down...

34:55.400 --> 34:57.320
don't take your life.

34:57.480 --> 34:59.480
Just hold on.

34:59.640 --> 35:01.120
For one more day.

37:00.280 --> 37:01.920
It's not going to be...

37:03.800 --> 37:05.280
Someone help me.

37:05.440 --> 37:06.880
I think...

37:07.640 --> 37:09.960
I made a... mistake.

37:10.120 --> 37:13.520
God, Heather.
Can't you see that Betty's in pain?

38:16.440 --> 38:17.920
Would you look at that?

38:18.080 --> 38:19.800
I never thought I'd see the day.

38:19.960 --> 38:22.640
Heather's home before curfew.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.800
It is a miracle from heaven.

38:24.960 --> 38:27.320
Honest to God miracle.

38:27.480 --> 38:29.160
I think you were right, honey.

38:30.440 --> 38:34.480
-Think I was.
-I think we finally got through to her.

38:36.120 --> 38:37.680
Finally did.
