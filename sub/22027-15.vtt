13:48.828 --> 13:50.873
- We don't know.
Doc hasn't said--

13:50.917 --> 13:52.440
- How long has he been
in surgery?

13:52.483 --> 13:53.484
What's the procedure?

13:53.528 --> 13:54.616
- We're all in the same boat.

13:54.659 --> 13:56.966
We're just waiting for news.

13:59.969 --> 14:02.319
- Hey, folks.
He just got out of surgery.

14:02.363 --> 14:04.582
He's in recovery now.

14:04.626 --> 14:06.367
- Much better than anyone
could have expected.

14:06.410 --> 14:07.890
The bullet didn't damage
the vertebrae

14:07.934 --> 14:09.283
or the spinal cord.

14:09.326 --> 14:11.589
It merely grazed the bone
and got stuck,

14:11.633 --> 14:15.289
right here in the C1-C2 region.

14:15.332 --> 14:16.856

all mean?

Herrmann.

14:27.170 --> 14:28.824
but if you want to see him,

14:28.868 --> 14:31.305
one or two guests
should be fine.

do him better

14:35.048 --> 14:36.788

14:43.970 --> 14:46.668
- Absolutely.

14:46.711 --> 14:52.456
- Dr. Choi.
What's the outlook, long

14:52.500 --> 14:54.937
- He's stable,
but that could change.

14:54.981 --> 14:57.679
The bullet is still dangerously
close to his spinal cord.

14:57.722 --> 14:59.942
Without intervention,
there's a risk of infection,

14:59.986 --> 15:01.509
possibly even paralysis.

15:01.552 --> 15:03.728
Why not just intervene?

15:03.772 --> 15:05.339
- It's a high-risk procedure.

15:05.382 --> 15:06.862

to the spinal column,

15:06.906 --> 15:08.516
plus he has
a blood clotting disorder,

15:08.559 --> 15:11.127

platelet transfer.

27:29.952 --> 27:32.694
- Yeah.

27:32.738 --> 27:37.481
- I just want to say, um,
about last shift at the fire,

27:37.525 --> 27:39.962
it was never about disrespect.

27:40.006 --> 27:42.486
I was reacting
and not thinking,

27:42.530 --> 27:46.012
and I just want you to know
that it shouldn't have happened

27:46.055 --> 27:49.145
and it won't happen again.
You have my word.

27:51.408 --> 27:53.323
- Understood.

27:54.847 --> 27:57.545
Oh, Kelly.

27:57.588 --> 28:03.029
I'm aware that you lost more
than most these past few years.

28:03.072 --> 28:04.726
The heart you have,
it's a strength.

28:04.770 --> 28:06.554
It's not a liability.

28:06.597 --> 28:08.077
I would never ask you
to give it up.

28:08.121 --> 28:10.776
But you have gotta know,

28:10.819 --> 28:13.256
duty comes first.

28:18.305 --> 28:19.959
- Chief Grissom
and Chief Walker

28:20.002 --> 28:21.090
here to see you.

28:21.134 --> 28:22.875
- Thank you, Connie.

28:28.881 --> 28:29.838
Come on in.

28:29.882 --> 28:30.839
- Wallace.

28:32.319 --> 28:34.538
- I understand
you're a man down today.

28:34.582 --> 28:35.844
Terrible business.

28:35.888 --> 28:37.324
- Yeah, well,
all things considered,

28:37.367 --> 28:38.760
my firefighters
are handling it well.

28:38.804 --> 28:40.370
- That's good to hear.

28:40.414 --> 28:42.111
Reality being what it is,
though,

28:42.155 --> 28:45.027
we have to think about
the future of Truck 81.

28:45.071 --> 28:47.029
- In the sense that we can't

28:47.073 --> 28:50.554
keep a seat on hold
indefinitely.

28:50.598 --> 28:53.383
- Look, Firefighter Zvonecek
is undergoing a procedure

28:53.427 --> 28:55.211
this morning
at great personal risk.

28:55.255 --> 28:56.560
He has every intention
of coming--

28:56.604 --> 28:58.345
- We'll see how that goes,
but moving forward,

28:58.388 --> 29:00.173
we can't have your truck
understaffed

29:00.216 --> 29:03.176
any longer than a shift or two.

29:04.438 --> 29:05.352
- Understood.

29:05.395 --> 29:06.657
- I'll send you
and your captain

29:06.701 --> 29:08.398
a list of floaters to consider.

29:08.442 --> 29:09.878
We'll talk.

29:09.922 --> 29:11.662
- Appreciate it, Chief.

29:16.885 --> 29:18.626
Okay.

29:18.669 --> 29:21.063
Before we begin today,

29:21.107 --> 29:23.892
I have an update
from the hospital.

29:23.936 --> 29:27.330
Otis is headed to surgery
as we speak.

29:27.374 --> 29:29.506
Now, I'll report the news
the moment I have it,

29:29.550 --> 29:30.638
but in the meantime,

29:30.681 --> 29:33.510
let's just keep him
in our prayers.

29:33.554 --> 29:38.254
I have also been informed
Samantha Haberman,

29:38.298 --> 29:40.822
the woman who took a bullet
in the fire last shift,

29:40.866 --> 29:43.085
she has succumbed
to her wounds.

29:45.174 --> 29:47.089
Is her son finally gonna
get arrested for man--

29:47.133 --> 29:48.874
- That's on the CPD
and the state's attorney

29:48.917 --> 29:50.440
to decide, not us.

29:52.965 --> 29:56.359
- Look, okay, we had
a terrible moment last shift.

29:56.403 --> 29:58.622
We nearly lost one of our own.

29:58.666 --> 30:01.277
So for the next few hours,
I want each of us

30:01.321 --> 30:04.237
to put aside our anger

30:04.280 --> 30:07.501
so we can show this city
who we are.

30:07.544 --> 30:10.591
- Of course, Chief.
- Yes, Chief.

30:10.634 --> 30:12.680
- Okay, then.

30:12.723 --> 30:14.247
Dismissed.

30:14.290 --> 30:15.422
- Engine 51,

30:15.465 --> 30:18.120
ambo 61, squad 3, house fire.

30:18.164 --> 30:19.469
10144 North Bell Avenue.

30:19.513 --> 30:21.036
- That's the house
where Otis was shot.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.170
- Let's move!

30:40.577 --> 30:41.883
- I saw the smoke
from our window.

30:41.927 --> 30:43.363
I knew something wasn't right.

30:43.406 --> 30:45.321
I thought it might've
started burning again.

30:45.365 --> 30:47.671
- All right,
just stand back, sir.

30:53.025 --> 30:54.243
- Yeah, I hear it too.

30:54.287 --> 30:56.593
Let's get this thing open.

31:04.906 --> 31:06.168

31:18.485 --> 31:21.314
- Run and get some cutters.

31:21.357 --> 31:23.272
- I can fit under there,
get a head start.

31:23.316 --> 31:25.013
Don't know how much exhaust
he's already taken in.

31:25.057 --> 31:27.973

31:28.016 --> 31:30.323
Capp, hurry up!
- Copy that!

31:44.903 --> 31:47.253
Damn it!

32:03.225 --> 32:05.097
I got him!
He's not breathing!

32:05.140 --> 32:07.403
- Get him on a stretcher!

32:10.711 --> 32:13.105
- I'm not getting a pulse.
We need to intubate.

32:13.148 --> 32:14.671

Shock and clear.

Patrick, can you hear me?

No, no, no, no!

32:55.451 --> 32:56.931
Ah, can't do that.
Can't do that, honey.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.238
- Patrick.
Patrick. Hey.

32:59.281 --> 33:01.414
Your dad needs you.

33:01.457 --> 33:03.024
And you can't bail on him now.

33:03.068 --> 33:04.460
Oh, hey.
Oh, hey, hey.

33:04.504 --> 33:07.594
You screwed up.
You can't change that.

33:07.637 --> 33:09.422
But he knows
that you never meant

33:09.465 --> 33:11.554
for any of this to happen.

33:11.598 --> 33:14.601
Now, you can keep this
from getting worse.

33:14.644 --> 33:18.692
Give your dad
a chance to forgive.

33:18.735 --> 33:21.695
You owe him that much at least.

33:26.395 --> 33:28.963
- Heart rate's 110.
Let's get him to Med.

33:40.714 --> 33:43.499
Uh, Otis is getting out
of surgery any minute.

33:43.543 --> 33:44.848
I was wondering if it'd be okay

33:44.892 --> 33:46.459
if I could get off
so I could be there.

33:46.502 --> 33:49.070
- You're not going alone.

33:49.114 --> 33:51.072
- Copy that.
Let's go.

33:51.116 --> 33:52.378
- Thanks, Chief.

34:07.654 --> 34:07.871

34:07.915 --> 34:09.264
- He's okay.

34:09.308 --> 34:10.744
Thank God.

34:10.787 --> 34:12.224
Doctors are saying
he came through just fine.

34:13.703 --> 34:14.748
- Yeah, you can.

34:14.791 --> 34:16.402
- You guys go ahead.

34:16.445 --> 34:17.881
- Thanks, Casey.

34:23.148 --> 34:24.584
- Hey, there he is.

34:24.627 --> 34:26.586
Look at this guy.

34:26.629 --> 34:28.544
Strong as an ox.

34:28.588 --> 34:30.068
- I don't feel it.

34:30.111 --> 34:31.852
- The whole house is in
the waiting room.

34:31.895 --> 34:35.769
- I'm not used to being
the center of attention.

34:35.812 --> 34:37.597
Thanks, you guys.

Sorry about that.

Otis is fine.

Boden chewed your ear off

34:58.313 --> 35:00.010

the other day.

35:00.054 --> 35:02.709
- Yeah,
I'd rather not relive it.

35:02.752 --> 35:05.364
- For what it's worth,
I get it.

35:05.407 --> 35:07.366
Racing into burning buildings

35:07.409 --> 35:10.891
but being stuck outside
while someone you love

35:10.934 --> 35:14.547
is at risk, hell,
there's no training

35:14.590 --> 35:18.420
that can make that any easier.

35:18.464 --> 35:19.726

you don't want it to be there.

construction site in my skull.

I can focus more.

I'll be hopping back up
on Truck.

- Well, that's up to
the department.

I'm sure it's gotta be
nothing, right?

36:50.904 --> 36:52.427

36:52.471 --> 36:55.213

37:02.263 --> 37:04.222
Nothing...

37:10.619 --> 37:12.447

37:12.491 --> 37:15.842
Just cleaning out some
useless junk from my locker.

Antonio gave me these

37:17.583 --> 37:19.149

37:19.193 --> 37:20.499
Don't know why
I still keep them.

37:20.542 --> 37:21.500

37:26.809 --> 37:29.725
And that includes
this thing with Antonio.

37:29.769 --> 37:31.074
- Okay.

37:31.118 --> 37:33.338
That sounds different
than last night.

37:33.381 --> 37:35.078
- I mean, technically,
nothing changed

37:35.122 --> 37:37.472
about our situation since
before I took the test, right?

37:37.516 --> 37:38.865
- True.
- Right.

37:38.908 --> 37:40.562
So why would my feelings
be any different now?

37:40.606 --> 37:45.785
I wanted to keep things light,
leave my options open, do me.

37:45.828 --> 37:47.047
- I like this new attitude.

37:47.090 --> 37:49.310
Strong. Steady.

37:49.354 --> 37:53.445
- And who knows, I mean, if...
if down the line,

37:53.488 --> 37:55.403
Antonio and I are meant
to be together, then--

37:55.447 --> 37:57.187
- Veering off course.

37:57.231 --> 37:59.842
I think it might be better to
just stick to the first part.

37:59.886 --> 38:03.237

You're right.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.717
Fresh start.

38:04.760 --> 38:07.720
New day, new Brett.

38:07.763 --> 38:10.026
