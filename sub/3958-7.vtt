Is Finn at home?
He's gone to Leeds, Rae.

00:06.337 --> 00:09.536
Fag? You're sitting there
with your thumb up your arse

00:09.537 --> 00:11.136
while they take the piss out of me.

00:11.137 --> 00:14.216
I kind of owe you 16 birthday
presents.

00:14.217 --> 00:17.336
So Izzy told him about the kiss? No.
She just broke up with him.

00:17.337 --> 00:20.717
You shut your mouth please.

00:23.777 --> 00:26.696
You're supposed to be my best mate
and you don't give a shit!

00:26.697 --> 00:29.816
I'm not your mum! Stay away from me.

00:29.817 --> 00:33.817
How long has she been gone?
Two days.

01:39.059 --> 01:41.218
Morning. Hiya.

01:41.219 --> 01:44.498
Liam, wake up,
you lazy little shit. Jesus.

01:44.499 --> 01:48.499
Don't Jesus me. Listen, Remember
to ring the sparky. OK.

01:49.779 --> 01:53.779
For your Nana.
Whatever. Lazy bugger.

02:00.139 --> 02:04.139
Can I use your bathroom before
I leave? Yeah, go for it.

02:06.779 --> 02:10.779
Did you sleep with your clothes on?
Yes. Me too.

02:14.379 --> 02:18.379
It's pretty cool we're as fucked up
as each other.

02:20.179 --> 02:22.338
Did you enjoy last night?

02:22.339 --> 02:25.258
I know it was your, er, first time.

02:25.259 --> 02:29.259
Totally loved it. Perfect.

What do you think you're doing?

03:45.819 --> 03:49.618
I've got one place on Earth
that I can go and chill out.

03:49.619 --> 03:53.218
One place that is not filled
with your staff or Karim's stuff

03:53.219 --> 03:56.618
or the baby's stuff.
And you've taken that away from me.

03:56.619 --> 04:00.619
I am not sharing my room
with your baby.

04:00.859 --> 04:04.218
We are redecorating so I had to move
your stuff. Yeah, I can see that.

04:04.219 --> 04:07.978
I found this.

04:07.979 --> 04:11.378
So? It's from your dad.

04:11.379 --> 04:15.379
Isn't it?

04:20.858 --> 04:23.418
You gave me his address,
what did you expect?

04:23.419 --> 04:25.978
I just don't know what you could
possibly want from him,

04:25.979 --> 04:29.979
what he could bring to your life.
He's interested in me.

04:30.739 --> 04:33.778
He buys me amazing presents.

04:33.779 --> 04:37.779
But best of all, he doesn't
talk about babies all the time.

04:41.979 --> 04:44.858
Do you know what? I wish that...

04:44.859 --> 04:48.859
Don't say it. Don't you dare say it.

04:50.059 --> 04:53.018
Why did you have to get pregnant?

04:53.019 --> 04:57.019
You've already messed up one kid's
life. Why do it to another?

04:58.419 --> 05:02.419
Just tell me one thing.

05:02.579 --> 05:06.579
Do you care at all about this baby?

05:08.379 --> 05:12.379
No.

05:15.739 --> 05:18.298
What?

05:18.299 --> 05:22.299
What, are you going to slap me
again?

05:33.619 --> 05:35.778
'All I'd wanted for months

05:35.779 --> 05:39.338
'was to fit into college, to have a
normal life.

'I was no longer just a big
girl in first year.

05:42.579 --> 05:46.578
'I was the girl who had the panic
attack on stage.

05:46.579 --> 05:50.579
'I was the crazy girl.'

05:52.219 --> 05:55.858
So? I thought you was mental
when you set the alarm off.

05:55.859 --> 05:59.538
Freaking out on stage takes it
to a different level.

05:59.539 --> 06:03.298
Everyone thinks you're a psycho,
you know?

06:03.299 --> 06:06.698
You are not the only one
everyone's talking about, though,

06:06.699 --> 06:09.338

mate?

06:09.339 --> 06:11.818
You can say whatever you
want about me,

06:11.819 --> 06:15.458

Chloe. Ever.

06:15.459 --> 06:19.459
You better get off her. Little
bitch. Are we clear? Rachel!

06:26.259 --> 06:30.259
Do you want to tell me what's going
on? I give you a warning.

06:32.019 --> 06:36.019
I give you a final warning. There is
no final final morning, Rae.

06:36.739 --> 06:39.498
Well, you don't have to kick me out.

06:39.499 --> 06:41.898
I can't do it. I'm leaving.

06:41.899 --> 06:43.538
I'm not going to let you do that.

06:43.539 --> 06:45.978
Why? You just said you were going
to kick me out.

06:45.979 --> 06:49.218
Rae, you are one of the cleverest
students in this entire college.

06:49.219 --> 06:52.738
Don't throw that all away because of
a bunch of bullies and knobheads.

06:52.739 --> 06:54.218
We'll fix it.

06:54.219 --> 06:58.219
Haven't you heard? I'm crazy.

06:59.259 --> 07:01.138
And no-one can fix that.

07:01.139 --> 07:04.338
Thanks
for all the chances you've given me.

07:04.339 --> 07:08.339
And I'm so sorry if I let you down.

07:16.739 --> 07:20.578
'That's the thing about Rae Earl,
she will let you down.

07:20.579 --> 07:24.218

with will fall apart.

07:24.219 --> 07:27.658
'Touched by the darkness of her
disease.

07:27.659 --> 07:31.659
Her bright future. Her gang of
friends. Her family.

07:35.019 --> 07:39.019
'Even her best friend.

07:39.939 --> 07:43.939
'Maybe I keep finding myself on my
own because no-one wants me around.

07:46.299 --> 07:50.299
'Maybe it's
because they know I'm mental.'

07:54.699 --> 07:56.458
All right, everyone?

07:56.459 --> 08:00.459
I just wanted to start by saying that
Danny is about to go home.

08:04.699 --> 08:06.378
Thanks, everyone.

08:06.379 --> 08:10.379
I thought I'd be
a bit more excited about today.

08:14.099 --> 08:18.099
I-I can't remember what it's like,
as such, outside.

08:20.379 --> 08:24.379
I'm just a bit afraid of fitting in.

08:27.179 --> 08:30.938
Of people thinking that I'm weird.

08:30.939 --> 08:34.938
I can be myself in here
and that's fine.

08:35.379 --> 08:39.379
Because there's people
who like the weird bits of me.

08:40.419 --> 08:44.419
And there's people who can hold
me together when...

08:44.859 --> 08:48.859
..when everything else falls apart.

08:58.819 --> 09:02.138
What's the matter with you? You're
normally the first one out the door.

09:02.139 --> 09:06.139
I've decided to come back.
into hospital.

09:08.819 --> 09:12.819
Please let me come back. You can't
just decide to come back to hospital.

09:13.219 --> 09:16.258
Danny is leaving.
So there's a room free.

09:16.259 --> 09:19.978
That's not how it works, it's not a
hotel, it's a hospital. But I'm sick.

09:19.979 --> 09:22.538
But not by the standards of this
hospital, you're not.

09:22.539 --> 09:24.618
The people who come and stay here

09:24.619 --> 09:27.178
are either a danger to themselves
or to others.

09:27.179 --> 09:28.818
You're neither of those things.

09:28.819 --> 09:30.378
You've stopped hurting yourself.

09:30.379 --> 09:34.379
You haven't hurt yourself for
months.

09:34.699 --> 09:38.699
What's happened? No, I don't want to
talk about it with you.

09:41.419 --> 09:45.419
Therapy, it doesn't work.

09:46.019 --> 09:49.458
I've been coming to you for six
months and nothing's changed.

09:49.459 --> 09:52.338
In my professional opinion,
I think you're wrong.

09:52.339 --> 09:55.778
If nothing had changed,
you'd still be hurting yourself.

09:55.779 --> 09:59.779
People who are broken, they don't
want you to be professional.

10:00.539 --> 10:04.539
They just want you to be real.

10:12.659 --> 10:15.778
'Dear Diary. Is this how it works?

10:15.779 --> 10:17.858
'Aren't you allowed back into
hospital

10:17.859 --> 10:19.658
'unless you do something extreme?

10:19.659 --> 10:21.778
'Do you have to show you're broken
on the inside

10:21.779 --> 10:24.659
'by breaking yourself on the
outside?'

10:39.619 --> 10:43.619
'How's it going? I wanted to write
you a letter to say hi.

10:45.499 --> 10:49.499
'And also to say sorry about leaving
like I did. I miss you already.

10:51.339 --> 10:55.339
'You are world-class. I mean that.

10:56.339 --> 11:00.339

they always look to.

'You're the glue.

11:05.899 --> 11:09.899
'So no pressure. Laters. Finn.

11:11.299 --> 11:14.538
'Don't let Chop do his running
elephant joke any more.

11:14.539 --> 11:18.539
'It's not as funny as he thinks it
is.'

11:27.019 --> 11:31.018
'What was the point in ringing
Finn? He was gone now.

11:31.019 --> 11:35.019
'What would I even say?
What if he was right, though?

11:35.979 --> 11:38.418
'What if I was the glue?

11:38.419 --> 11:40.778
'What if, because I'm the one
that broke at all,

11:40.779 --> 11:44.178
'I'm the one that can fix it?

11:44.179 --> 11:48.058
'The problem is that when everything
is in a million little pieces,

11:48.059 --> 11:52.059
'it's hard to know what to try
and fix first.

11:52.379 --> 11:56.379
'I guess I had to begin with the
hardest thing of all.'

11:57.219 --> 11:58.618
Hi, Mr Gemell.

11:58.619 --> 12:02.058
Is it all right if I speak to Chloe?
I need to apologise to her.

12:02.059 --> 12:05.898
Chloe's not here,
she's still missing. She's not back?

12:05.899 --> 12:08.558
We don't know what to do.

12:17.975 --> 12:19.695
We've talked to the police.

12:19.777 --> 12:21.496
She's never been
missing for this long,

12:21.497 --> 12:24.656
so they've finally taken seriously.

12:24.657 --> 12:28.376
They're going to want to talk to
you and your friends at some point.

12:28.377 --> 12:31.936
We've talked to this Ian person.
Yeah.

12:31.937 --> 12:35.937
But he said he doesn't know where
she is. Nobody knows where she is.

12:39.897 --> 12:43.897
This is Chloe's diary.
I don't know if it will help.

12:44.977 --> 12:48.976
I took it the other day.
Why did you take it?

12:48.977 --> 12:51.816
I don't know.

12:51.817 --> 12:55.456
I wanted to find out why she'd been
behaving the way she had.

12:55.457 --> 12:57.856
I wasn't thinking.

12:57.857 --> 13:01.857
I'm too wrapped up in my own stuff.

13:01.937 --> 13:05.937
I haven't been a very
good friend to her.

13:08.337 --> 13:12.337
Neither have I.

13:12.497 --> 13:15.656
'There was no way that Ian didn't
know where Chloe was.

13:15.657 --> 13:17.296
'No way!

13:17.297 --> 13:21.256
'There was also no way
I was going to his house on my own.

13:21.257 --> 13:22.696
'I needed backup.

13:22.697 --> 13:25.776
'I needed to take one of the other
fixes off my list first.

13:25.777 --> 13:28.016
'But the problem was,
Archie was mad at Chop

13:28.017 --> 13:30.576
for not standing up for him in front
of Simmy and Macca.

13:30.577 --> 13:33.376
Izzy was mad at Archie for telling
Chop she'd kissed Peter.

13:33.377 --> 13:35.616
And Chop was mad at Izzy
because she dumped him

13:35.617 --> 13:38.376
and now they all refused to
be in the same room together.

13:38.377 --> 13:39.696
It's the perfect storm.

13:39.697 --> 13:43.456
Well, the perfect shit storm.

13:43.457 --> 13:45.376
Hi, muggins.

13:45.377 --> 13:47.856
Is it true? What?

13:47.857 --> 13:49.696
That you've left college? Yes.

13:49.697 --> 13:51.416
You can't, I won't let you.

13:51.417 --> 13:54.456
I've put up with too much
whingeing from you to let it happen.

13:54.457 --> 13:58.376
Listen, that's not why I asked you
here. Well, why did you?

13:58.377 --> 13:59.696
Rae!

13:59.697 --> 14:02.496
Look, just listen to me for a
second, please. What's going on?

14:02.497 --> 14:04.936
What's he doing here? Er...
What's he doing here?

14:04.937 --> 14:06.616
What's she doing here?

14:06.617 --> 14:07.736
Oh, bollocks!

14:07.737 --> 14:10.617
It would be easier gluing
dog shit to the wind.

14:12.097 --> 14:15.816
Well, at least I got them in one
place. Maybe it wasn't a lost cause.

14:15.817 --> 14:18.856
And if I can fix the gang,
maybe I can fix everything else.

14:18.857 --> 14:22.336
This is your fault, Iz. What is?
Clo going missing.

14:22.337 --> 14:25.136
How is it my fault? Don't take
a genius to work it out, does it?

14:25.137 --> 14:27.336
You cheating on me,
that made things awkward.

14:27.337 --> 14:30.056
If you hadn't have done that, me
and you would still be together,

14:30.057 --> 14:31.496
the gang would still be together

14:31.497 --> 14:33.576
and we would have seen
that Chloe was in the shit.

14:33.577 --> 14:35.056
But I didn't even want to kiss him!

14:35.057 --> 14:37.376
I didn't fancy him.
It was a mistake.

14:37.377 --> 14:40.696
Well, why did you kiss him then?

14:40.697 --> 14:42.976
See. You still can't tell me.

14:42.977 --> 14:44.496
Yeah, but it isn't my fault.

14:44.497 --> 14:46.536
If Archie hadn't told you
about me and Peter...

14:46.537 --> 14:47.856
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:47.857 --> 14:49.576
I didn't make you kiss the guy,
did I?

14:49.577 --> 14:51.296
If it's anyone's fault it's Chop's.

14:51.297 --> 14:54.936
What? Because I tell you for free
whose fault it isn't. Uncle Archie's.

14:54.937 --> 14:57.776
Archie, I told you to stop calling
yourself that. How can it be mine?

14:57.777 --> 15:01.777
You're all making it seem like me,
the one who's done... Guys, guys!

15:01.817 --> 15:05.817
Stop it. Please, just stop it.

15:05.897 --> 15:08.896
It's everyone's fault.

15:08.897 --> 15:12.496
Mainly Izzy's. I beg your pardon?

15:12.497 --> 15:15.576
You know what, Chop,
I'll tell you why I kissed Peter.

15:15.577 --> 15:19.496
Because I was upset and disappointed
with you for what you did to Archie.

15:19.497 --> 15:22.456
You let them boys kick him
off the football team and call him

15:22.457 --> 15:25.736
horrible names and be mean to him.
Yeah? What those boys done.

15:25.737 --> 15:29.737
I didn't do it.
Yeah, you didn't DO anything.

15:29.897 --> 15:32.536
Bad shit happens
when good people do nothing.

15:32.537 --> 15:35.176
This is some fresh bullshit.
Let me out of the car. What?

15:35.177 --> 15:37.416
Let me out the car!

15:37.417 --> 15:39.137
Stop it! Guys, stop it!

15:42.977 --> 15:45.336
Maybe I couldn't fix the gang.

15:45.337 --> 15:47.576
Maybe they were broken forever.

15:47.577 --> 15:51.577
But so long as there was a shot
at helping Chloe, I had to take it.

15:51.697 --> 15:53.137
Even if it was on my own.

16:06.737 --> 16:09.216
What do you want? Is Chloe here?

16:09.217 --> 16:10.497
No.

16:12.817 --> 16:16.136
Can I use your toilet?
No, you can't.

16:16.137 --> 16:18.216
Don't be a dickhead,
I know where it is.

16:18.217 --> 16:21.056
I was always surprised why Chloe
was friends with you.

16:21.057 --> 16:25.016
She's beautiful, you're minging.
OK...

16:25.017 --> 16:27.096
I just want to see my best mate,
please.

16:27.097 --> 16:28.496
We only let you hang out with us

16:28.497 --> 16:31.216
because Chloe told us
you were funny and clever.

16:31.217 --> 16:33.736
That's what they always
say about fat girls, isn't it?

16:33.737 --> 16:37.737
Got great personality. You haven't.

16:38.537 --> 16:40.736
Chloe?

16:40.737 --> 16:43.776
Have you ever stopped to think
why Chloe hasn't been in touch?

16:43.777 --> 16:46.696
Because she doesn't want you around
her. No-one wants you around...

16:46.697 --> 16:49.216
No-one wants you around...

16:49.217 --> 16:52.456
No-one wants you around.

16:52.457 --> 16:56.457
Go on, then. Fuck off.

17:03.217 --> 17:04.856
Ian was right.

17:04.857 --> 17:08.215
No one wants me around here
because I don't fix things,

17:08.217 --> 17:12.215
I only break them.
But I know a place where they do.

17:12.217 --> 17:16.217
Where people understand me.
Like Tix understood me.

17:16.577 --> 17:19.776
And I know how to make them
take me back.

17:19.777 --> 17:21.776
Just a little cut.

17:21.777 --> 17:23.616
Not like last time.

17:23.617 --> 17:27.617
Just a few little cuts.

17:35.257 --> 17:37.617
Mum?

17:47.617 --> 17:51.617
Mum?

17:56.497 --> 17:59.176
Mum?

17:59.177 --> 18:03.177
Mum!

18:10.737 --> 18:13.696
Mum? Oh, no!

18:13.697 --> 18:15.656
Rae, it's the baby.

18:15.657 --> 18:19.056
I need you to help me, darling. No.

18:19.057 --> 18:22.936
No, mum, I'm not strong enough,
I can't. You can, darling.

18:22.937 --> 18:25.376
Everything is going to be fine.

18:25.377 --> 18:26.976
I promise.

18:26.977 --> 18:30.977
Now go and get me some towels.
OK, OK.

18:37.697 --> 18:41.536
Good girl. Ring me an ambulance.

18:41.537 --> 18:44.016
OK, please.

18:44.017 --> 18:47.296
OK, OK!

18:47.297 --> 18:51.297
Doctor, I've
got the notes you needed before...

18:55.377 --> 18:57.337
I'm sorry, you can't
come any further.

19:18.017 --> 19:22.017
They haven't said anything.

19:34.617 --> 19:38.576
You go for sleep, yes?

19:38.577 --> 19:42.577
I ring. If they say, I ring. Cool.

20:15.097 --> 20:17.176
'Look after them all.

20:17.177 --> 20:21.177
'You're the one they always look to,
you're the glue, so no pressure.

20:22.417 --> 20:26.417
'Laters, Finn.'

20:37.937 --> 20:41.536
There are times when I can't stop
speaking, when a million words

20:41.537 --> 20:43.856
leave my mouth in a
matter of seconds,

20:43.857 --> 20:45.457
a million words that mean nothing.

20:49.137 --> 20:52.216
Hello?

20:52.217 --> 20:56.217
Hello?

20:57.217 --> 20:59.816
But when I want to find some words
that mean everything,

20:59.817 --> 21:02.656
I just can't speak.

21:02.657 --> 21:06.496
Like "I miss you," like "I love you,"

21:06.497 --> 21:09.857
like, "My world is falling apart
and I need you by my side."

21:13.217 --> 21:14.816
Hello?

21:14.817 --> 21:18.817
'Good morning, Rae. It's Kester.
I just wanted to ring

21:19.017 --> 21:23.017
'to say I would love you
to come in today for a session.'

21:23.817 --> 21:27.817
Yeah.

21:33.577 --> 21:36.896
You must be tired.

21:36.897 --> 21:40.897
Yeah. Well, I didn't want to go to
sleep in case the hospital rang.

21:43.297 --> 21:47.297
I wanted to apologise for losing
my temper with Liam the other day

21:47.577 --> 21:51.577
and for not setting a good example,
boundaries-wise.

21:51.817 --> 21:55.736
I shouldn't have come
round to your house.

21:55.737 --> 21:59.696
I was angry because
I was embarrassed about it.

21:59.697 --> 22:03.496
Yeah, well, I shouldn't
have lost my temper.

22:03.497 --> 22:07.497
I only did it because I care
about you, about all of you.

22:09.617 --> 22:13.617
I guess from now on we'll just
establish the boundaries as we go.

22:18.977 --> 22:21.216
I'm a horrible person, Kester.

22:21.217 --> 22:25.217
Why would you say that?

22:26.097 --> 22:30.097
My mum asked me if I
cared about the new baby.

22:31.777 --> 22:35.136
And I said no.

22:35.137 --> 22:37.816
And the frightening thing is...

22:37.817 --> 22:41.456
is that I meant it.

22:41.457 --> 22:45.457
I don't care.

22:45.577 --> 22:48.216
Everywhere I go I seem to
break things.

22:48.217 --> 22:52.217
And the more I try to fix them,
the more I make it worse.

22:53.737 --> 22:57.576
It's not just my mum,
it's my friends, it's Chloe.

22:57.577 --> 23:01.296
Because you can't fix other people
until you've fixed yourself.

23:01.297 --> 23:05.297
But I can't be fixed.
Because I'm crazy.

23:06.417 --> 23:10.416
You're not crazy.

23:10.417 --> 23:13.976
If you want to be a nicer
person to other people,

23:13.977 --> 23:16.616
that's where it starts.

23:16.617 --> 23:18.696
I've tried being nice to myself.

23:18.697 --> 23:20.696
Have you?

23:20.697 --> 23:24.136
Because you've just been telling me
what a horrible person you are.

23:24.137 --> 23:27.536
You're just using whatever's
happening with Chloe

23:27.537 --> 23:31.416
or your mum as another
reason to hate yourself.

23:31.417 --> 23:34.896
Every session, you say
that I need to love myself,

23:34.897 --> 23:38.416
I need to start liking
myself more. For months now.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.816
You're like a broken record.

23:40.817 --> 23:44.817
But you never tell me how to start
or when to start or where to start.

23:45.217 --> 23:48.976
All right, we'll start now then.

23:48.977 --> 23:51.256
Not tonight, not tomorrow,
not after this cup of tea,

23:51.257 --> 23:55.257
we'll start right now.

23:57.177 --> 23:59.336
Close your eyes.

23:59.337 --> 24:03.337
Close your eyes.

24:03.657 --> 24:07.296
Now I want you to tell me
what you don't like about yourself

24:07.297 --> 24:09.656
but be honest with me.
Don't be clever,

24:09.657 --> 24:13.657
don't be angry. Be honest.

24:14.737 --> 24:18.456
I'm fat.

24:18.457 --> 24:21.616
And I'm ugly.

24:21.617 --> 24:23.456
And I ruin things.

24:23.457 --> 24:27.457
Try and find some sense
of how long you've felt that way.

24:28.777 --> 24:32.777
I don't know.
Since I was about nine or ten.

24:33.257 --> 24:37.257
So this is an opinion you formed
a long time ago about yourself.

24:38.417 --> 24:42.096
Open your eyes.

24:42.097 --> 24:46.097
I want you to imagine a
ten-year-old version of yourself

24:46.817 --> 24:49.736
sitting right there on this coach.

24:49.737 --> 24:52.976
Now this is the little girl who
first believed that she was fat

24:52.977 --> 24:55.536
and ugly and an embarrassment.

24:55.537 --> 24:59.537
I want you to imagine her
sitting there right now.

25:02.737 --> 25:06.737
Now tell that little girl she's
fat. I'm not going to do that.

25:07.257 --> 25:09.936
Tell that little girl she's ugly.
I don't want to.

25:09.937 --> 25:13.816
Tell that little girl she's
an embarrassment and worthless

25:13.817 --> 25:15.816
and useless.

25:15.817 --> 25:17.816
Because that's what you
do every single day

25:17.817 --> 25:19.736
when you say that to yourself.

25:19.737 --> 25:22.416
When you convince yourself
that you're an embarrassment

25:22.417 --> 25:25.616
and a burden. Well,
don't you think she's ugly?

25:25.617 --> 25:28.176
No. No? Or fat? No.

25:28.177 --> 25:32.056
No? Or an embarrassment?
Or horrible or worthless?

25:32.057 --> 25:36.057
Just stop it! No!

25:38.377 --> 25:42.377
Right? No.

25:49.497 --> 25:53.497
Want do you want to say
to that little girl?

25:54.057 --> 25:57.856
If she said to you that's
how she felt about herself,

25:57.857 --> 26:01.656
what would you tell her?

26:01.657 --> 26:05.657
That she's fine.

26:05.897 --> 26:08.376
That she's perfect.

26:08.377 --> 26:11.736
Then that's what you
need to tell yourself.

26:11.737 --> 26:15.737
Every time you feel that
panic, that anxiety...

26:17.817 --> 26:21.817
..you need to soothe yourself like
you would soothe the little girl.

26:23.657 --> 26:25.976
Yeah?

26:25.977 --> 26:27.816
Yeah.

26:27.817 --> 26:31.817
You need to tell yourself that
everything's going to be OK.

26:32.657 --> 26:36.657
If you commit to that,

26:37.497 --> 26:41.497
then I promise you you'll
be able to face anything.

26:43.897 --> 26:47.897
And it starts right now.

26:49.777 --> 26:53.777
Everything starts right now.

26:57.537 --> 26:59.616
Do you ever wish you could look back

26:59.617 --> 27:02.696
and see the exact moment your life
started to come together?

27:02.697 --> 27:04.856
The end of the beginning,

27:04.857 --> 27:08.857
the moment you knew everything
was about to change?

27:12.217 --> 27:16.016
Is there any news?
She's out of danger.

27:16.017 --> 27:17.976
Has she said anything?

27:17.977 --> 27:20.536
No, I mean your sister. My sister?

27:20.537 --> 27:24.537
Yeah. She's in intensive care.

27:24.817 --> 27:27.136
Is she going to be OK?

27:27.137 --> 27:31.137
We just need to wait and see what
happens in the next few hours.

27:31.697 --> 27:34.856
What about my mum?
It's too early to say.

27:34.857 --> 27:38.857
We're doing everything
we can for her.

28:15.257 --> 28:16.656
Thanks.

28:16.657 --> 28:19.937
That's all right.

28:22.017 --> 28:25.096
I'm a sister.

28:25.097 --> 28:28.856
I'm actually someone's
big sister.

28:28.857 --> 28:32.857
Nice. I think you'll make
a pretty good big sister.

28:33.697 --> 28:34.736
Yeah?

28:34.737 --> 28:36.016
Yeah.

28:36.017 --> 28:37.896
You don't think I'll be annoying?

28:37.897 --> 28:39.976
I didn't say that.

28:39.977 --> 28:43.977
Right.

28:47.617 --> 28:51.617
If you need a lift here after
college, then I can take you.

28:52.577 --> 28:56.577
I've got a lot of free
time on my hands.

28:58.337 --> 29:02.337
I've decided that being
a scaffolder in Leeds

29:02.897 --> 29:06.897
wasn't exactly the dream
I thought it'd be.

29:08.777 --> 29:11.376
Thanks, but...

29:11.377 --> 29:15.377
It's all right.
I'm not going to college any more.

29:16.897 --> 29:20.256
Why would you leave?

29:20.257 --> 29:24.257
Everyone there knows that I'm crazy.
You guys know me. You understand me.

29:27.337 --> 29:30.336
Not everyone's like that, Finn.

29:30.337 --> 29:34.176
Yet, but everyone's crazy.

29:34.177 --> 29:38.177
Everyone has to struggle and fight,
they just haven't realised it yet.

29:40.017 --> 29:44.017
At least you have.

29:45.657 --> 29:49.657
Once upon a time, in a disabled
toilet far, far away...

29:52.297 --> 29:56.297
..you asked me why I liked you.
Remember?

29:56.377 --> 29:59.736
Yeah, I remember.

29:59.737 --> 30:02.856
It's because you're strong.

30:02.857 --> 30:06.857
You just haven't realised it yet.

30:07.417 --> 30:11.417
Rachel, you can see your
sister now, if you like.

30:17.337 --> 30:19.296
I'm your big sister.

30:19.297 --> 30:23.297
I'm going to look after you and love
you and make sure you're all right.

30:28.537 --> 30:31.896
You're perfect.

30:31.897 --> 30:35.897
You are perfect.

30:35.977 --> 30:39.977
You can be strong.
You can be strong.

30:40.017 --> 30:44.017
You CAN be strong.

30:44.617 --> 30:48.617
What do you want?

30:48.817 --> 30:50.736
I want you to tell me where Chloe is.

30:50.737 --> 30:52.416
Why should I?

30:52.417 --> 30:53.976
Because I want to know she's OK.

30:53.977 --> 30:56.656
Why don't you just go away
and stop bothering people?

30:56.657 --> 30:58.216
Who's that?

30:58.217 --> 31:02.217
Visitor for you, mate.

31:03.737 --> 31:05.736
What the fuck are you doing here?

31:05.737 --> 31:08.896
She says she's looking for Chloe
but I think she's come for you, lad.

31:08.897 --> 31:11.816
Yeah, Chloe told me
why you won't sleep with me.

31:11.817 --> 31:15.817
She said that you've got a problem
with taking your clothes off and
that. It doesn't surprise me.

31:16.417 --> 31:19.856
If I looked like you,
I'd probably feel exactly the same.

31:19.857 --> 31:23.336
Weird, Chloe can't keep her clothes
on but you can't take them off.

31:23.337 --> 31:26.216
It'd have been a pity fuck
as well, you know?

31:26.217 --> 31:29.176
Like any fuck
she'll ever have. Right?

31:29.177 --> 31:30.456
I was pissed.

31:30.457 --> 31:34.457
'If I looked like you,
I'd probably feel exactly the same.'

31:45.457 --> 31:49.457
You're perfect. You are perfect.

31:49.937 --> 31:52.496
Everything is going to be OK.

31:52.497 --> 31:55.536
Listen, Rae...

31:55.537 --> 31:58.696
It's time you do one.

31:58.697 --> 32:00.616
No.

32:00.617 --> 32:04.617
I'm looking for Chloe.
Are you going to move or what?

32:07.777 --> 32:11.777
Chloe?

32:15.577 --> 32:19.577
Oh, Chloe. Thank God.

32:22.417 --> 32:26.417
What are you doing here, Rae?
I've come to take you home.

32:26.577 --> 32:29.256
Everyone's really worried
about you. I'm fine.

32:29.257 --> 32:33.257
No-one's hurt me.

32:34.297 --> 32:38.297
You shouldn't be going out with
Ian, Clo. He's not a nice person.

32:39.657 --> 32:43.416
Going out?

32:43.417 --> 32:47.176
We're not going out. We're fucking,

32:47.177 --> 32:51.177
having fun, getting wasted.

32:51.897 --> 32:54.896
And we can do that and
still sleep with whoever we want

32:54.897 --> 32:58.416
because we're adults.

32:58.417 --> 33:02.417
I fooled around with Ben
the other night, so what?

33:03.377 --> 33:07.377
You wouldn't get it
because you're not a part of it.

33:09.217 --> 33:13.217
And I know what you're thinking.

33:13.817 --> 33:16.936
You think they're taking
advantage of me.

33:16.937 --> 33:19.256
But they aren't.

33:19.257 --> 33:22.296
They like me.

33:22.297 --> 33:24.976
You know, and I'm the one
taking advantage.

33:24.977 --> 33:27.776
I'm the one with the power, me.

33:27.777 --> 33:31.777
So what is it that you think
they like about you, then, Clo?

33:32.697 --> 33:35.776
I didn't say like, I said want.
You said like.

33:35.777 --> 33:39.777
Well, what's the difference?

33:40.777 --> 33:44.777
Do you have any idea how
good it feels when someone,

33:45.457 --> 33:49.216
someone literally can't
keep their hands off you

33:49.217 --> 33:53.217
and they grab you
like they're crazy?

33:53.337 --> 33:55.696
You think I'm a bad person,
I can see that.

33:55.697 --> 33:57.056
No, I don't think that.

33:57.057 --> 33:59.696
No, you think I'm a stupid slag!

33:59.697 --> 34:01.856
Well, so what?!

34:01.857 --> 34:05.576
It's my body and I can
do what I want with it.

34:05.577 --> 34:09.176
Do you understand that?
I do understand.

34:09.177 --> 34:13.177
Clo, I do, I do understand. I do.

34:16.777 --> 34:20.777
Chloe, please let me
get you out of here.

34:21.657 --> 34:25.657
I'm scared. I know.
But it'll be all right.

34:28.817 --> 34:32.360
OK, everything will be all right.
I promise.

34:48.177 --> 34:51.377
Here you go. It's
your favourite mug.

34:54.617 --> 34:57.177
Is your mum going to be all right?

34:57.281 --> 35:01.281
I don't know.

35:01.801 --> 35:05.801
Can I get you anything else? No.

35:06.601 --> 35:10.601
Rae... I'm scared about
telling my parents everything.

35:13.721 --> 35:17.721
I'm scared about Ian coming
to find me. Hey, don't be.

35:18.001 --> 35:21.280
OK, we'll sort it out.

35:21.281 --> 35:25.281
We'll sort everything out.

35:28.081 --> 35:31.800
Chloe...

35:31.801 --> 35:34.840
I found your diary in your room.

35:34.841 --> 35:37.640
I read it.

35:37.641 --> 35:41.641
I let you down.

35:41.881 --> 35:45.881
I'm so sorry that I let you down.

35:47.161 --> 35:49.160
So, you know about Finn?

35:49.161 --> 35:51.840
Yeah.

35:51.841 --> 35:54.640
I didn't fall in love
with him on purpose.

35:54.641 --> 35:56.400
I know...

35:56.401 --> 36:00.401
I'm not meant for a Finn.

36:00.521 --> 36:04.521
I'm meant for a Ian. Oh,
Chloe, of course you're not.

36:05.201 --> 36:09.201
You need to start being
kinder to yourself.

36:09.521 --> 36:13.521
You need to... you need
to soothe yourself.

36:15.881 --> 36:17.920
Say, "OK, Rae."

36:17.921 --> 36:19.360
OK, Rae.

36:19.361 --> 36:20.680
"OK, Rae!"

36:20.681 --> 36:24.680
OK, Rae!

36:24.681 --> 36:28.400
God!

36:28.401 --> 36:31.520
Oh, what's everyone
in college saying?

36:31.521 --> 36:34.760
They are saying that you're a slut.

36:34.761 --> 36:38.761
Nice. And I'm mental... oh.

36:41.241 --> 36:45.241
Do you know, I don't even
care what they think of me.

36:46.121 --> 36:49.760
I just care what you think of me.

36:49.761 --> 36:53.761
Well, I think... that
you're my best mate...

36:57.481 --> 37:00.320
..and I think you're amazing!

37:00.321 --> 37:01.641
Stop it.

37:12.881 --> 37:16.881
Oh, baby! Oh, baby, you
know it's OK, it's OK.

37:18.241 --> 37:20.080
Are you all right?

37:20.081 --> 37:23.480
Mmmm, yeah, I'm stable... apparently.

37:23.481 --> 37:27.481
First time in my life anyone's
ever said that about me.

37:28.441 --> 37:31.600
Hey, I'm sorry we fell out.

37:31.601 --> 37:34.560
When I was lying there on the
bathroom floor, I remember

37:34.561 --> 37:38.240
thinking how bad it would be if...

37:38.241 --> 37:42.241
Well, you know, if... the last
thing we did was have an argument

37:42.601 --> 37:44.560
and that was how you remembered us.

37:44.561 --> 37:46.720
No, don't be stupid.

37:46.721 --> 37:50.721
I was just angry about
you seeing your dad.

37:51.281 --> 37:55.281
I was selfish, it's just because
I don't think he's a nice person.

37:56.121 --> 38:00.121
You should have the opportunity
to form your own opinions.

38:00.441 --> 38:04.441
Mum, how did you know it was him

38:04.841 --> 38:06.840
that gave me that record player?

38:06.841 --> 38:10.000
Oh, I don't know.

38:10.001 --> 38:13.440
Mum?

38:13.441 --> 38:16.440
It's the same record
player he gave me,

38:16.441 --> 38:19.960
for our anniversary, 20 years ago.

38:19.961 --> 38:23.320
I didn't want to tell you.

38:23.321 --> 38:25.680
Why would he do that?

38:25.681 --> 38:28.080
I honestly don't know.

38:28.081 --> 38:32.081
Maybe he just forgot.

38:32.401 --> 38:35.840
Anyway, I've got a
favour to ask you.

38:35.841 --> 38:38.600
I've not seen the baby yet.

38:38.601 --> 38:41.000
Will you describe her to me.

38:41.001 --> 38:45.001
Mum, she's so cute... her fingers and
toes are like little Rice Krispies.

38:45.841 --> 38:48.240
She's the most beautiful
baby in the whole world

38:48.241 --> 38:52.241
and she yawns like
a little lion cub...

39:00.081 --> 39:03.200
There's a part in all of us
that's scared and not sure.

39:03.201 --> 39:06.200
And when you get the ability
to see that in yourself,

39:06.201 --> 39:10.201
you start to see that everyone
is fighting, every day and just

39:10.361 --> 39:14.360
like Finn said, so,
instead of saying,

39:14.361 --> 39:16.840
"You're fat and
you're ugly..."

39:16.841 --> 39:20.240
I'm going to say, "You are the
person who helped your mum out,

39:20.241 --> 39:24.241
"Who saved your best mate who lives
with an illness but keeps on going."

39:25.881 --> 39:29.520
Me... I did all that all that.

39:29.521 --> 39:31.240
That's not to say me

39:31.241 --> 39:34.920
and Chloe weren't scared of going
back to college, we were terrified.

39:34.921 --> 39:38.921
But we had to do it for each other.

39:40.161 --> 39:41.800
Jesus!

39:41.801 --> 39:45.801
Because there's nothing we couldn't
face when we're together.

39:46.361 --> 39:49.040
I thought you were off getting
your brains shagged out by every

39:49.041 --> 39:51.760
man in Stamford.

39:51.761 --> 39:55.761
Don't Rae.

39:56.881 --> 40:00.881
Oh...

40:03.361 --> 40:07.321
See you later Vicky.

40:12.881 --> 40:16.640
Listen, there something I've got
to go an do, are you all right?

40:16.641 --> 40:20.641
Yes, I'll be fine. Are
you going? Yes... go!

40:25.241 --> 40:28.480
So, you've come out of hiding.

40:28.481 --> 40:32.280
So, how about tonight, then?

40:32.281 --> 40:36.281
Listen, Liam, I think we
should just be friends.

40:38.881 --> 40:41.640
I just don't think that
we're good for each other.

40:41.641 --> 40:43.440
Why?

40:43.441 --> 40:45.600
I don't want to be
fucked up any more.

40:45.601 --> 40:49.080
I don't think that there's anything
wrong with being fucked up.

40:49.081 --> 40:53.081
Yeah, you say that... so, you don't
think that people can change?

40:58.401 --> 41:02.401
But I know that they can.

41:03.641 --> 41:07.560
Liam could stay the same and
that's OK but I was changing now

41:07.561 --> 41:10.240
and that meant not turning
up on my dad's doorstep.

41:10.241 --> 41:12.840
It meant, finally, writing
him a letter that said,

41:12.841 --> 41:15.560
"It was nice to meet you
and see you around."

41:15.561 --> 41:19.561
Because the truth was
that I already had a dad.

41:20.481 --> 41:23.680
Hang on, Mum, why are
we going into your room?

41:23.681 --> 41:27.680
Well, that's the thing,
it's not our any more.

41:27.681 --> 41:29.241
It's your room.

41:30.761 --> 41:32.520
What?

41:32.521 --> 41:36.521
No! Oh, my God!

41:37.481 --> 41:38.800
Do you like it?

41:38.801 --> 41:41.480
Yeah! Wait, where are
you going to sleep?

41:41.481 --> 41:42.920
Oh, we'll go in with the baby and

41:42.921 --> 41:44.760
when mini Boushtat
needs her own space,

41:44.761 --> 41:47.760
we'll sort something out. Anyway,
you'll be at uni then, won't you?

41:47.761 --> 41:49.160
Eh, eh, won't you?

41:49.161 --> 41:52.080
Yeah! Yeah!

41:52.081 --> 41:56.040
Hang on... how did you
two afford all this?

41:56.041 --> 41:58.880
Well, why do you think
Karim took a second job?

41:58.881 --> 42:01.840
He's been working nights to
make this whole house look nice,

42:01.841 --> 42:04.040
haven't you Mr Lollypop.

42:04.041 --> 42:06.000
Stop! Cross.

42:06.001 --> 42:07.560
Really?

42:07.561 --> 42:09.560
I like, it's not bad.

42:09.561 --> 42:11.600
No.

42:11.601 --> 42:15.601
Mum, thank you. Karim, thank you.

42:15.881 --> 42:18.000
Oh, baby. I don't know what to say.

42:18.001 --> 42:20.320
You didn't have to
do all this for me.

42:20.321 --> 42:24.321
It's my job number
three, job number three,

42:24.881 --> 42:28.240
taking care of my three ladies.

42:28.241 --> 42:29.640
Yes?

42:29.641 --> 42:33.240
I say wrong? Love, you said perfect!

42:33.241 --> 42:36.640
Anyway, little Boushtat gets
to come home next week,

42:36.641 --> 42:38.800
so, say goodbye to sleep.

42:38.801 --> 42:40.600
You all right with that?

42:40.601 --> 42:43.000
Mum, you joking?

42:43.001 --> 42:45.200
I can't wait!

42:45.201 --> 42:48.440
Everything was slowly
coming back together.

42:48.441 --> 42:52.441
There was just one
thing left to be fixed.

42:53.161 --> 42:54.960
So, what time's Finn getting here?

42:54.961 --> 42:58.880
How should I know?

42:58.881 --> 43:02.320
Archie, I'm so sorry
that I was mad at you.

43:02.321 --> 43:05.480
Look, I know that you were angry at
Chop and that's why you told him.

43:05.481 --> 43:09.481
I'm sorry too.

43:09.561 --> 43:12.520
Awww!

43:12.521 --> 43:14.240
Oh, for...

43:14.241 --> 43:16.080
You all right, dudes?

43:16.081 --> 43:19.920
How's it hanging... Archie,
still a bummer?

43:19.921 --> 43:21.880
Just go away!

43:21.881 --> 43:24.760
What, that was a
legitimate question.

43:24.761 --> 43:26.440
Are you still a bummer?

43:26.441 --> 43:30.441
Stop! Everyone, stop
what they're doing!

43:30.601 --> 43:34.601
Why don't you tell the full pub
what you've just asked Archie?

43:36.281 --> 43:37.720
What you on about, Chop, man?

43:37.721 --> 43:41.080
I'm being serious, pal! Tell
the whole pub! Piss off!

43:41.081 --> 43:45.081
This motherfucker here is
a top fella and I sat there

43:45.241 --> 43:49.241
and watched you two mugs
take the piss out of him.

43:50.161 --> 43:54.161
I'm sorry, lad. Jesus, are you
two going out or something?

43:57.441 --> 44:00.280
If I see you in this pub again,

44:00.281 --> 44:03.040
I'll fucking debrief you!

44:03.041 --> 44:07.041
Off you pop, lads.

44:07.321 --> 44:09.681
Bye! Bye!

44:11.881 --> 44:15.881
Chop, you didn't have to...

44:17.921 --> 44:19.560
I love you, lad.

44:19.561 --> 44:20.921
I mean that.

44:32.961 --> 44:34.920
There he is.

44:34.921 --> 44:36.760
Hiya, Rae, all right?

44:36.761 --> 44:38.240
Are you all right, Danny?

44:38.241 --> 44:40.240
Yeah, thanks for inviting me.

44:40.241 --> 44:41.680
I'm so excited and nervous.

44:41.681 --> 44:45.120
I only wore one hat cos I
don't want everybody to think

44:45.121 --> 44:49.121
I'm too mad or anything.

44:49.161 --> 44:52.680
And that was that, everything
was back together again... well,

44:52.681 --> 44:54.200
almost everything.

44:54.201 --> 44:56.760
Taking a bite out of a
piece of bread was one thing

44:56.761 --> 44:59.000
but getting naked was another.

44:59.001 --> 45:00.840
And if I couldn't do it,

45:00.841 --> 45:04.720
then it wasn't fair to Finn
to get involved with him again.

45:04.721 --> 45:07.120
Or to be around him.

45:07.121 --> 45:09.040
How's it going?

45:09.041 --> 45:11.160
Ups and downs, you know.

45:11.161 --> 45:15.161
I just wondered if we could talk.

45:15.601 --> 45:19.601
You know, about you and me. No, no,
I don't think that's a good idea.

45:22.681 --> 45:24.921
I don't think talking's a good idea.

45:30.999 --> 45:34.999
Dear Diary, that's the thing with
diaries, they're like movies,

45:35.679 --> 45:39.238
they're just stories,
filled with the things I saw

45:39.239 --> 45:40.878
and the things I felt.

45:40.879 --> 45:42.678
But when I look around,

45:42.679 --> 45:46.679
I see that everyone's the
protagonist of their own story.

45:46.999 --> 45:50.999
And the thing about stories is that
not all of them have a happy ending.

45:54.199 --> 45:58.199
But some do.

46:01.759 --> 46:05.759
This is much better than talking.

46:06.080 --> 46:09.940
Yeah, well, when I say,
"To be continued,"

46:10.031 --> 46:14.031
I mean, "To be continued!"
