WEBVTT

00:40.392 --> 00:41.810
No joy with the flare.

00:41.810 --> 00:43.562
I cannot make out
the target, over.

00:43.562 --> 00:43.979
(helicopter passing overhead)

00:48.650 --> 00:49.401
This is Perry.

00:49.401 --> 00:50.402
I'll proceed
to the next checkpoint.

00:50.402 --> 00:52.154
I repeat, I've got the target.

00:53.071 --> 00:53.238
(gunshots)

00:55.490 --> 00:56.825
Moving to target two.

00:57.409 --> 00:57.742
(gun clicking)

01:08.670 --> 01:10.213
MAN (over radio):
Be advised, be advised.

01:10.213 --> 01:11.506
Clear and lock all weapons.

01:11.506 --> 01:14.176
Return to HQ once you have
a safe weapon.

01:14.509 --> 01:18.513
(car horn honks nearby)

01:26.188 --> 01:28.106
REPORTER (over speaker):
It's going to be a hot one
in Miami today

01:28.106 --> 01:30.275
with a high of 98 degrees.

01:30.275 --> 01:33.111
We will have some relief
with a nice tropical breeze

01:33.111 --> 01:34.112
blowing in from the southeast.

01:34.112 --> 01:34.196
This is Johnny Mountain,
WKOR Weather.

01:34.196 --> 01:35.197
What do you think
you were doing?

01:35.197 --> 01:36.364
They rushed the clock.

01:37.115 --> 01:38.283
We could have had
a perfect score,

01:38.283 --> 01:39.367
That was my last target.

01:41.286 --> 01:42.204
Matt, what's wrong?

01:43.872 --> 01:45.207
You killed someone.

02:10.565 --> 02:13.276
CAINE:
Our victim is a dead
U.S. Marine, Frank.

02:13.276 --> 02:16.488
Sergeant Timothy Hicks,
he's a recruiter here in Miami.

02:16.905 --> 02:19.199
Who came out to a
civilian gun range.

02:19.407 --> 02:20.575
Except none
of these wannabes

02:20.575 --> 02:22.160
claim they saw our
victim today.

02:23.662 --> 02:25.580
Till Derrick Perry there
put five in his back.

02:25.580 --> 02:28.250
Look, I told you already,
I didn't mean to.

02:28.250 --> 02:30.043
I saw it, sir--
it was an accident.

02:30.043 --> 02:31.002
And you are?

02:31.253 --> 02:32.170
Matthew Batra.

02:32.254 --> 02:33.797
Derrick and I come here
all the time.

02:34.506 --> 02:35.090
I know you're thinking

02:35.090 --> 02:36.675
I was all battle crazy
and didn't see him...

02:36.675 --> 02:39.594
but that guy didn't make
a sound.

02:39.845 --> 02:41.513
That's because
he was already dead.

02:42.264 --> 02:43.181
TRIPP:
He was shot somewhere else

02:43.181 --> 02:43.849
and dumped here.

02:43.849 --> 02:45.851
Which is why
there's no blood, Frank.

02:46.518 --> 02:47.519
No blood.

02:47.769 --> 02:49.187
So we're, like, free to go?

02:49.271 --> 02:51.440
Yeah, you're free to go,
but don't go far.

02:55.694 --> 02:56.695
Somebody wanted us to think

02:56.695 --> 02:58.864
our vic died here
in this playground war.

02:59.614 --> 03:02.284
Frank, the war may be staged,

03:02.701 --> 03:04.119
but the murder is real.

03:55.768 --> 03:57.437
WOLFE:
So the victim
was a Marine recruiter?

03:57.437 --> 03:59.188
That's probably motive
right there, right.

03:59.772 --> 04:01.858
You got something against
the military, Wolfe?

04:01.941 --> 04:03.610
No, but with what's going on
in Iraq right now,

04:03.610 --> 04:04.694
it makes sense there are
a lot of people

04:04.694 --> 04:06.613
who have it out for the military,
don't you think?

04:07.280 --> 04:09.782
All I know is he
wears the uniform,
so he gets our best.

04:10.366 --> 04:11.784
Lividity puts his time of death

04:11.784 --> 04:13.870
several hours
before he was shot.

04:14.037 --> 04:16.039
That's why there wasn't
any blood.

04:29.302 --> 04:31.054
He was definitely
killed somewhere else.

04:31.054 --> 04:32.305
Do you get a cause
of death yet?

04:32.472 --> 04:34.057
Blunt force trauma
to the forehead,

04:34.057 --> 04:35.516
and I do mean blunt.

04:36.059 --> 04:37.227
Whatever hit him

04:37.310 --> 04:39.646
was flat and very hard.

04:40.063 --> 04:41.481
I'll start my recon.

04:41.564 --> 04:42.732
Hey, Eric...

04:43.650 --> 04:45.193
I'm also thinking kidnapping.

04:45.485 --> 04:47.737
His hands were bound
with something.

04:50.740 --> 04:52.408
Except his feet weren't.

04:53.243 --> 04:54.661
Killer bound his hands,

04:54.661 --> 04:57.288
probably used them like a
handle to drag him up here.

05:01.876 --> 05:04.337
Got the drag marks
over here to prove it.

05:04.837 --> 05:07.257
Probably not going to be able
to get any impression, though.

05:07.257 --> 05:08.841
Maybe they can tell us
where they came from.

05:11.177 --> 05:14.264
(camera shutter clicking)

05:22.313 --> 05:24.857
Yeah, it looks like
there was a struggle, but...

05:25.692 --> 05:26.859
it's hard to believe
that anybody

05:26.859 --> 05:28.861
could overpower a guy that big.

05:29.362 --> 05:30.863
This is his truck.

05:31.072 --> 05:32.782
It's registered
to a Timothy

05:32.782 --> 05:34.284
and Donna Hicks.

05:35.618 --> 05:37.036
He left a wife behind.

05:37.036 --> 05:38.955
He left his blood behind, too.

05:39.038 --> 05:40.957
I think this is where
our recruiter was killed.

05:50.383 --> 05:51.384
You ready for me?

05:51.384 --> 05:54.053
Calleigh, baby, have I ever
made you wait?

05:56.556 --> 05:58.808
(sighs)

05:58.808 --> 06:00.393
Man in uniform.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.563
And looks like he went
through a lot of them.

06:03.813 --> 06:04.898
What do you mean?

06:04.898 --> 06:07.066
Today wasn't the first time
he was shot.

06:07.567 --> 06:09.068
See these scars?

06:10.153 --> 06:12.405
They're old bullet wounds.

06:12.405 --> 06:14.407
Barely a piece of him
without a scar.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.243
Tim Hicks was a fighter.

06:17.243 --> 06:20.496
You know, I bet
he got some of them
saving people's lives.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.498
He was awarded
the Bronze Star.

06:24.667 --> 06:27.337
Yeah. That makes this
even harder to say.

06:29.088 --> 06:32.008
I found traces of a white powder
in his nasal cavity.

06:36.095 --> 06:38.431
Oh, I do not think
that he is the type.

06:38.514 --> 06:40.516
Well, things aren't always
as they seem.

06:40.850 --> 06:43.102
You know, I bet that powder
could help explain

06:43.102 --> 06:45.188
how someone overpowered
a trained soldier.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.273
I sent it to Tox.

06:47.273 --> 06:48.691
And you'll be the first to know.

06:49.192 --> 06:50.443
Thanks, Alexx.

06:57.617 --> 07:00.203
I heard you got the tox report
back on our dead recruiter,

07:00.203 --> 07:01.704
so, uh,
what's his poison?

07:02.038 --> 07:03.206
Ketamine.

07:03.456 --> 07:04.207
Ketamine?

07:04.207 --> 07:06.042
Is a cat tranquilizer,

07:06.376 --> 07:08.711
Yep. Commonly known on
the street as Special K.

07:08.711 --> 07:09.629
It won't kill anybody,

07:09.712 --> 07:11.548
but it's the perfect drug
to overpower someone.

07:12.131 --> 07:13.383
Well, they found powder
up his nose,

07:13.383 --> 07:15.468
so how do you get someone
to snort a drug?

07:16.386 --> 07:17.387
Trust.

07:17.804 --> 07:18.888
I don't follow.

07:18.888 --> 07:20.807
Well, I just found out his wife
is a veterinarian,

07:20.807 --> 07:24.394
so she'd have access to the drug
and... to his trust.

07:25.395 --> 07:26.479
Let's go.

07:26.563 --> 07:27.897
I'll drive.

07:35.154 --> 07:36.072
(dog barking in distance)

07:36.239 --> 07:37.657
DUQUESNE:
You work out of your
home, Dr. Hicks?

07:37.907 --> 07:40.159
Yeah. Kennel's out back,
as if you couldn't tell.

07:40.159 --> 07:41.995
Is that where you
kept the ketamine?

07:42.412 --> 07:45.081
Among other drugs I use
to treat the animals, yes.

07:45.248 --> 07:47.250
We found high doses
of ketamine in your
husband's system.

07:47.250 --> 07:49.085
Do you know
anything about that?

07:49.168 --> 07:50.169
Oh, my God.

07:52.589 --> 07:53.339
Yeah.

07:53.923 --> 07:58.344
Tim asked me about ketamine...
if it would relax him.

07:58.845 --> 08:00.513
So he took the ketamine
from your office?

08:00.513 --> 08:01.514
I guess so.

08:02.098 --> 08:03.933
He's never done anything
like that before.

08:05.268 --> 08:06.686
You don't understand.

08:06.686 --> 08:09.439
Tim doesn't just sign recruits
and then forget about them.

08:09.439 --> 08:10.940
He cares
about his recruits.

08:10.940 --> 08:13.693
Sometimes we'd get two
death notices a day from Iraq.

08:15.278 --> 08:16.779
TIMOTHY:
He put his trust in me.

08:17.113 --> 08:18.114
He was 20 years old.

08:18.531 --> 08:20.450
You were always
honest with him.

08:20.867 --> 08:22.452
(dogs barking in distance)

08:22.702 --> 08:24.120
You need some sleep.

08:26.789 --> 08:29.375
We're going to need
to check your medical
supplies, Dr. Hicks.

08:29.375 --> 08:31.878
Uh, we had a break-in
a couple days ago.

08:31.961 --> 08:33.296
Some things were taken.

08:33.712 --> 08:35.131
Were any of these
things ketamine?

08:35.215 --> 08:37.884
Maybe... I'm don't know
what all was taken.

08:37.884 --> 08:39.552
Did you file a police report?

08:40.385 --> 08:41.136
No.

08:41.136 --> 08:42.554
Yeah, I didn't
think so.

08:42.554 --> 08:44.474
Would you mind if we checked
point of entry?

08:44.474 --> 08:45.808
It's the back window.

08:45.892 --> 08:47.644
I haven't even cleaned up
the glass yet.

08:47.977 --> 08:49.562
Well, that's a good thing
for us.

08:53.816 --> 08:55.318
Am I going to lose
my license?

08:56.653 --> 08:59.155
There's a possibility
you may lose more than that.

09:21.761 --> 09:23.763
(trilled beeping)

09:26.849 --> 09:28.268
Hey, I just finished
running trace

09:28.309 --> 09:29.477
on the victim's wrists.

09:29.519 --> 09:30.603
Yeah, anything useful?

09:30.603 --> 09:33.231
Micropore elastic paper
with cotton overlay

09:33.273 --> 09:34.857
and a Uro-Bond adhesive.

09:34.857 --> 09:36.859
Medical tape.
But that's among
other things.

09:36.859 --> 09:38.361
It's got such
a wide range of uses.

09:38.945 --> 09:40.446
Okay, well, let's
hope we get something.

09:40.446 --> 09:44.242
I just pulled a fat,
juicy print off the
victim's nametag.

09:44.617 --> 09:46.202
I'm running it
through AFIS now.

09:49.706 --> 09:51.457
Sean Reynolds,
charged with assault

09:51.541 --> 09:54.294
a couple of years ago;
charges were dismissed.

09:54.794 --> 09:56.296
Look what he's got
for a work address.

09:56.296 --> 09:58.131
Yeah, that's a little more
than a coincidence.

09:58.715 --> 10:01.217
Wolfe's out in the field; I'm
going to have him pay a visit.

10:03.887 --> 10:04.929
Sean Reynolds?

10:06.556 --> 10:07.390
You tired of hamburger?

10:07.390 --> 10:08.892
You ready to eat steak?

10:09.267 --> 10:10.393
You've come to the right place.

10:10.393 --> 10:12.395
Yeah, um, Ryan Wolfe.

10:13.563 --> 10:14.731
Look like a leader, Wolfe.

10:14.898 --> 10:16.441
Marine Corps needs
leaders like you.

10:17.567 --> 10:20.153
I'm a CSI. I'm here to talk
to you about Tim Hicks.

10:21.404 --> 10:22.155
Hicks...

10:23.573 --> 10:24.407
He was a good man.

10:24.991 --> 10:26.117
And a top-notch recruiter.

10:26.242 --> 10:26.743
He'll be missed.

10:27.410 --> 10:28.494
You two recruit together?

10:28.912 --> 10:30.663
Let's just say we
both went after them.

10:32.081 --> 10:32.999
You mean you competed.

10:33.416 --> 10:35.418
Competition keeps you frosty.

10:35.585 --> 10:36.753
That's the Marine Corps way.

10:36.836 --> 10:37.837
The thing
about competition is,

10:37.837 --> 10:39.589
sometimes it can
get out of hand.

10:39.964 --> 10:41.591
See, your fingerprints
were found

10:41.591 --> 10:43.176
on Sergeant Hicks's uniform.

10:44.886 --> 10:46.262
You're looking to pin
his death on me?

10:46.846 --> 10:48.181
You want to tell me why
your hands

10:48.181 --> 10:50.016
were on the victim's chest?

10:53.353 --> 10:55.355
Couple days back,
Hicks got this letter.

10:55.897 --> 10:56.940
It just set him off.

10:57.607 --> 11:00.109
Hate mail's one thing, but this
guy's threatening my life.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.278
Listen to me,
it's just some whack job.

11:02.779 --> 11:03.613
All right?

11:04.280 --> 11:05.198
All right.

11:05.782 --> 11:06.950
Where's that letter now?

11:07.283 --> 11:08.451
Probably his desk.

11:12.580 --> 11:13.456
Thanks.

11:18.962 --> 11:19.712
"You killed me.

11:20.046 --> 11:21.506
"Killed me with your lies.

11:21.965 --> 11:23.591
My blood is on your hands."

11:24.801 --> 11:26.052
There isn't a return address.

11:26.386 --> 11:26.886
That's okay.

11:26.886 --> 11:28.388
The challenge keeps us frosty.

11:28.888 --> 11:30.306
It's the CSI way.

11:58.585 --> 12:00.753
* *

12:17.770 --> 12:18.438
Damn...

12:18.855 --> 12:19.439
What's wrong?

12:19.856 --> 12:21.774
I just ran the sample
from envelope.

12:22.108 --> 12:24.110
I got a really good
clean sample.

12:24.110 --> 12:25.695
But there's nothing
coming out of CODIS?

12:25.945 --> 12:28.364
Did you try the military
DNA database?

12:28.364 --> 12:29.032
Because if you ask me,

12:29.115 --> 12:31.284
it sounds like that letter
was written by a soldier.

12:31.367 --> 12:33.286
Does that database track
criminals in the military?

12:33.286 --> 12:34.954
It has all the people
in the military.

12:35.205 --> 12:37.874
Every recruits' DNA
is cataloged.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.293
It's mainly used
for identifying remains.

12:40.543 --> 12:41.961
How did we get access to that?

12:42.545 --> 12:44.214
It a perk when you cooperate
with JAG.

12:47.717 --> 12:49.302
Marine Corporal
Kevin Kirby.

12:50.386 --> 12:52.305
Let's see, where's he stationed?

12:52.305 --> 12:53.973
He was on the ground
in Fallah,

12:53.973 --> 12:56.976
but he's back home on
bereavement leave here in Miami.

12:57.477 --> 12:58.311
Who died?

13:00.647 --> 13:01.397
His brother.

13:01.898 --> 13:04.067
The funeral is tomorrow,
viewing is today.

13:04.567 --> 13:05.568
I'll let Horatio know.

13:05.652 --> 13:06.319
All right.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.519
* *

13:56.452 --> 13:58.705
Did you serve
with my Patrick in Iraq?

13:58.788 --> 14:00.540
No, Mrs. Kirby,
I'm not military.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.208
My name is Horatio Caine.

14:02.208 --> 14:03.376
I'm with CSI.

14:06.880 --> 14:09.883
Both of my sons served...

14:10.967 --> 14:12.719
but only one came back alive--

14:13.887 --> 14:14.804
Kevin.

14:16.139 --> 14:20.476
Ma'am, when you're ready,
I'd like to talk to Kevin.

14:26.149 --> 14:28.818
Kevin isn't really
Kevin anymore.

14:30.486 --> 14:32.238
Being over there
did something.

14:34.741 --> 14:35.491
You know...

14:36.910 --> 14:38.995
all he does is stare at the TV.

14:47.337 --> 14:48.671
He's right outside.

15:03.019 --> 15:03.770
CAINE:
Kevin?

15:03.853 --> 15:04.854
Sir.

15:07.273 --> 15:09.692
Kevin, I wanted to talk to you
about Sergeant Hicks.

15:10.944 --> 15:11.861
Yes, sir.

15:12.195 --> 15:13.279
Why don't you have a seat?

15:18.618 --> 15:19.369
I understand, Kevin,

15:19.369 --> 15:21.955
you wrote quite an angry letter
to the sergeant.

15:24.874 --> 15:25.875
I did, sir.

15:26.292 --> 15:27.043
Why did you do that?

15:30.380 --> 15:34.050
He, uh, told me that I could
make a lot of money

15:34.300 --> 15:36.302
if I got somebody
to join the Marine Corp,

15:37.887 --> 15:39.556
and that they would make
a lot of money, too.

15:41.391 --> 15:42.976
So you brought your brother,
Patrick.

15:43.893 --> 15:45.061
And now he's dead.

15:48.314 --> 15:48.815
Kevin,

15:50.066 --> 15:52.569
what if I were to tell you that
Sergeant Hicks is dead, too?

16:00.994 --> 16:02.161
It's my fault, sir.

16:02.912 --> 16:03.997
Sergeant Hicks?

16:04.414 --> 16:05.081
No.

16:06.666 --> 16:07.500
Patrick.

16:08.751 --> 16:10.670
I killed my brother, sir.

16:10.837 --> 16:12.005
In Iraq, I killed him.

16:12.005 --> 16:14.340
I killed my brother, sir!
He doesn't mean that.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.509
Kevin, you don't
mean that, baby.

16:16.843 --> 16:18.344
Why don't you go
inside, okay?

16:18.678 --> 16:20.013
(quietly):
Come on. Come on.

16:27.353 --> 16:28.438
I told you he's not well.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.690
He says these kinds of things
all the time.

16:31.190 --> 16:32.108
He's not right.

16:32.442 --> 16:33.443
I understand, ma'am.

16:35.361 --> 16:38.198
Ma'am, if you would ever like to
talk to me about this further,

16:39.365 --> 16:41.951
I would appreciate a call, okay?

17:14.398 --> 17:16.068
That the glass from
the Hicks's window?

17:17.069 --> 17:18.153
(laughs)

17:18.153 --> 17:19.238
How long were you watching?

17:19.238 --> 17:20.989
Long enough to know
you found something.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.574
Okay, yeah, I did.

17:23.075 --> 17:25.993
Some kind of staple fiber,
got Kevlar in it.

17:26.411 --> 17:27.246
It's Nomex.

17:28.413 --> 17:30.082
It's a flame
resistant material

17:30.082 --> 17:31.166
used in military gloves.

17:31.166 --> 17:32.668
SWAT uses it as well.

17:33.919 --> 17:35.504
So Dr. Hicks
was telling the truth--

17:36.255 --> 17:37.005
<i>someone did break in.</i>

17:38.674 --> 17:40.259
Okay, well, I'll swab it
for epithelials,

17:40.259 --> 17:42.511
and I'll run it through CODIS
and the military databases.

17:42.511 --> 17:44.012
You know what?
I think we already met the guys

17:44.012 --> 17:45.180
who were wearing those gloves.

17:45.514 --> 17:46.265
Which database?

17:47.182 --> 17:47.849
Neither.

17:49.518 --> 17:51.270
We already told Tex
everything there is to tell

17:51.270 --> 17:52.271
back at the gun range.

17:52.604 --> 17:54.106
Did you forget to tell
Detective Tripp

17:54.106 --> 17:56.191
that you recently broke into
the victim's house,

17:56.817 --> 17:57.693
and that you took drugs

17:57.693 --> 17:59.444
from his wife's
veterinary practice?

17:59.778 --> 18:01.196
You can't prove that.

18:03.115 --> 18:05.284
We found a piece of Nomex
on the window.

18:06.618 --> 18:08.453
All I have to do
is take a look at your gloves

18:08.453 --> 18:09.705
to see which one
of you did it.

18:11.415 --> 18:12.457
Don't fold, Matt.

18:12.875 --> 18:13.709
Then you tell.

18:13.876 --> 18:14.376
No way.

18:14.376 --> 18:15.294
Not on your life.

18:15.586 --> 18:17.379
Tell her or she's going to think
it's something worse.

18:17.462 --> 18:18.463
Worse than being a chicken?

18:18.463 --> 18:19.339
Chicken about what?

18:22.551 --> 18:24.469
Hicks and his partner
came to our school.

18:25.304 --> 18:26.138
He looked so
cool,

18:26.763 --> 18:28.473
you know, in his uniforms and everything?

18:29.975 --> 18:30.642
Hicks was talking about

18:30.642 --> 18:32.060
how we could make a difference
over there--

18:32.311 --> 18:34.146
<i>change history.Make history.</i>

18:34.855 --> 18:35.981
Save lives.

18:36.273 --> 18:36.940
So we signed up.

18:39.693 --> 18:42.237
Today, you've taken the first
step to becoming men.

18:43.572 --> 18:45.073
We're going to shoot
some big-ass guns.

18:45.240 --> 18:47.910
Just wait till the ladies see us
after boot, we'll be ripped.

18:48.577 --> 18:50.245
(laughing)

18:50.245 --> 18:52.206
Then Derrick started having
second thoughts.

18:52.581 --> 18:54.499
So we figured if we
stole back his file,

18:54.583 --> 18:56.084
there wouldn't be a way
to prove he enlisted.

18:56.084 --> 18:57.836
We wanted to hit up
his office, but...

18:58.754 --> 19:00.005
he took the files
home with him.

19:00.088 --> 19:00.839
Why didn't you just tell us you

19:00.839 --> 19:02.758
that you knew Sergeant Hicks
in the first place?

19:03.842 --> 19:04.593
Because...

19:05.886 --> 19:07.012
we thought it'd look bad.

19:07.179 --> 19:09.264
And yours was the only
application that you took?

19:10.182 --> 19:11.016
There was a bunch.

19:11.683 --> 19:14.019
We didn't know which one,
so we took them all.

19:16.563 --> 19:17.189
Okay.

19:18.774 --> 19:20.692
I'm going to need to take a look
at those files.

19:21.193 --> 19:21.860
Well, that's the thing.

19:21.860 --> 19:25.280
We, uh... we got rid of them.

19:26.949 --> 19:27.783
We burned them.

19:29.451 --> 19:31.161
Well, then you're right
about one thing--

19:31.537 --> 19:32.996
this looks really bad.

19:41.213 --> 19:42.047
Mrs. Kirby.

19:42.214 --> 19:44.049
Thank you for returning
my call, Lieutenant.

19:44.049 --> 19:45.384
They've arrested Kevin.

19:45.968 --> 19:47.386
Um, who's arrested him?

19:47.636 --> 19:48.387
JAG.

19:48.887 --> 19:50.806
They accused him
of murdering Patrick.

19:50.806 --> 19:51.890
But it was just rambling.

19:51.890 --> 19:54.560
Mrs. Kirby, have they released
Patrick's body yet?

19:56.395 --> 19:57.145
Yes.

19:57.354 --> 19:57.980
Okay.

19:57.980 --> 20:00.315
Would you mind if my team
took a look at him?

20:01.900 --> 20:02.985
I don't know, Lieutenant.

20:02.985 --> 20:06.154
Patrick has been through
so much already.

20:06.238 --> 20:07.281
Mrs. Kirby,

20:07.489 --> 20:10.158
Patrick is our chance
to save Kevin.

20:13.579 --> 20:14.913
Go home and
think about it.

20:27.259 --> 20:28.760
CAINE:
Have him take a seat, please.

20:39.062 --> 20:39.688
Kevin.

20:40.772 --> 20:42.274
I don't think you
can talk to me.

20:42.691 --> 20:44.860
I spoke to the officer
in charge of your case

20:44.860 --> 20:46.445
and it's okay to talk to me.

20:48.447 --> 20:49.907
Did my mother say it was?

20:49.948 --> 20:51.366
She asked me
to visit with you.

20:55.037 --> 20:56.038
I guess she trusts you then.

20:56.038 --> 20:58.957
So what I need now, Kevin,
is for you to trust me.

21:03.879 --> 21:05.714
I suppose you want to hear
about my brother.

21:05.964 --> 21:07.049
That's correct.

21:12.471 --> 21:15.641
I don't even remember the last
thing he said to me that day.

21:18.560 --> 21:19.811
But I know the first.

21:20.771 --> 21:21.647
You're dead, Kevin.

21:21.897 --> 21:23.482
Bring it on, baby, bring it on!

21:23.774 --> 21:25.484
Set. Hike.
(plane flying overhead)

21:27.903 --> 21:28.904
Hey, Patrick, I'm open.

21:29.071 --> 21:29.154
(grunting)

21:29.154 --> 21:29.988
Come on,
get that guy..

21:29.988 --> 21:32.658
Tackle him.
Get him

21:34.409 --> 21:35.160
(whooping)

21:35.160 --> 21:35.244
That's what
I'm talking about.

21:35.244 --> 21:35.994
Yeah!

21:38.580 --> 21:39.540
(Patrick sighs)

21:39.665 --> 21:41.083
Chow is on you, bro.

21:41.083 --> 21:44.169
Kobe steak, baked potato,
maybe a banana split.

21:44.169 --> 21:45.087
Three scoops.

21:45.337 --> 21:46.838
Just like
the brochure promised.

21:47.756 --> 21:49.508
(both laughing)

21:54.096 --> 21:56.181
<i>KEVIN:
Eyes are open 24/7.</i>

21:59.268 --> 22:01.103
<i>It's that one blink
that they catch you.</i>

22:07.860 --> 22:08.735
Man, this stuff is better

22:08.777 --> 22:10.195
than anything
my mom made.

22:10.445 --> 22:12.447
Maybe that's 'cause you
was always dissin' her like that.

22:13.282 --> 22:14.950
I'm
about to take your bread,
too, brother.

22:16.285 --> 22:17.202
(chuckles)
PATRICK:
Incoming!

22:17.202 --> 22:20.372
(explosion)

22:23.083 --> 22:24.793
(alarm buzzing)

22:24.918 --> 22:26.712
(gunfire)

22:27.379 --> 22:28.297
KEVIN:
Patrick!

22:29.840 --> 22:31.049
Patrick!

22:33.760 --> 22:34.970
Your unit was attacked.

22:35.846 --> 22:36.763
Insurgents.

22:37.806 --> 22:38.849
Off the radar.

22:39.641 --> 22:42.644
And the whole world
went sideways.

22:43.562 --> 22:44.980
(gunfire)
Patrick!

22:59.161 --> 23:00.579
(explosion)

23:13.175 --> 23:15.844
(gunfire fades)

23:44.540 --> 23:45.958
I knew it was him.

23:48.460 --> 23:50.796
But he didn't stop,
so I emptied my mag.

23:52.297 --> 23:54.883
I was trained to kill,
so I killed.

23:58.470 --> 24:00.305
I don't care what
JAG does with me...

24:02.057 --> 24:04.643
'cause I'm already dead.
Kevin,

24:05.143 --> 24:06.728
I don't think
you killed your brother.

24:06.812 --> 24:08.313
Don't tell me that!

24:08.564 --> 24:09.147
Kevin...

24:09.147 --> 24:11.066
You said that I could trust you.

24:11.066 --> 24:14.069
You just stated that you emptied
your entire mag into him.

24:15.904 --> 24:17.656
That's not possible, Kevin.

24:18.657 --> 24:20.742
He only had one bullet hole
in his chest.

24:22.995 --> 24:24.580
We're done here, sir.

24:25.080 --> 24:27.499
Kevin, I'm not
gonna give up on you.

24:51.440 --> 24:53.442
* *

25:20.469 --> 25:22.971
* *

25:51.416 --> 25:53.418
* *

26:29.571 --> 26:30.489
Alexx.

26:31.073 --> 26:32.407
I fluoroscoped
his body.

26:32.908 --> 26:33.575
I found this

26:33.575 --> 26:35.243
buried in his chest cavity.

26:36.495 --> 26:38.413
That's not
a bullet, is it?
No.

26:39.081 --> 26:40.665
The unit corpsman
dug that out

26:40.665 --> 26:42.584
during their field
autopsy in Iraq.

26:42.751 --> 26:44.336
But they missed this.

26:44.669 --> 26:45.670
Is it shrapnel?

26:45.837 --> 26:47.839
Only one entrance
wound on that boy.

26:48.173 --> 26:49.674
So it entered with the bullet.

26:50.092 --> 26:50.759
My guess...

26:51.176 --> 26:53.595
the bullet passed through something

26:53.595 --> 26:54.763
before
it entered Patrick,

26:54.763 --> 26:57.182
and whatever that was,
this is a piece of it.

26:57.265 --> 26:58.100
Let me see that.

27:00.185 --> 27:01.770
Alexx, I think that's paint.

27:02.354 --> 27:03.438
Camouflage, maybe?

27:03.438 --> 27:05.357
No, vehicle paint.

27:05.690 --> 27:07.442
I'm going to get it
to Trace. Thank you.

27:08.693 --> 27:10.195
How am I gonna find
a vehicle in Iraq?

27:10.612 --> 27:11.780
It's the first Internet war,
Coop;

27:11.780 --> 27:14.282
soldiers carry those DV cameras
everywhere they go now.

27:14.282 --> 27:16.284
Yeah, I know, every
homemade battle video

27:16.284 --> 27:17.369
is posted on the Internet.

27:17.619 --> 27:18.787
That's what
I'm hoping for.

27:18.870 --> 27:20.455
Someone had to record
the firefight

27:20.455 --> 27:21.790
that Patrick Kirby died in.

27:22.707 --> 27:23.291
Okay.

27:24.292 --> 27:26.545
I'll let you
know what I find.
Thank you.

27:27.796 --> 27:30.215
Patrick Kirby's
personal effects I take it.

27:30.799 --> 27:31.883
His mother sent
over everything

27:31.883 --> 27:33.051
that he'd had in Iraq,

27:33.218 --> 27:35.137
including the uniform
that he died in.

27:35.971 --> 27:36.638
Yeah.

27:36.972 --> 27:38.056
What else did we get?

27:38.640 --> 27:39.057
Well...

27:39.641 --> 27:42.561
I found these hairs that were
too long for a military haircut,

27:42.644 --> 27:44.479
so I ran them
domestically for DNA.

27:45.397 --> 27:46.481
Brad Hoffman.

27:47.149 --> 27:47.983
You know him?

27:48.150 --> 27:49.067
I'm about to.

27:52.070 --> 27:53.155
I've never been to Iraq.

27:53.655 --> 27:55.073
I know Patrick from Miami.

27:55.240 --> 27:56.575
I grew up with both brothers.

27:57.159 --> 27:58.744
In fact, they were going
to work for my company

27:58.744 --> 27:59.911
when they got
back from there.

28:00.078 --> 28:01.163
See the problem,
Brad,

28:01.163 --> 28:03.665
is that we found one of your hairs
inside the boot

28:03.665 --> 28:05.917
that Patrick was killed in
on the battlefield.

28:06.918 --> 28:08.503
Well, that must've
happened this morning.

28:08.670 --> 28:09.671
This morning?

28:09.755 --> 28:12.090
Yeah, I went to pay my respects to
Kev and his mom.

28:12.090 --> 28:13.091
The boots were at the wake.

28:32.194 --> 28:34.112
And his mom can confirm this?

28:34.446 --> 28:35.280
Ask her, man.

28:36.615 --> 28:36.948
You know,

28:37.365 --> 28:39.868
isn't Iraq a little out
of your jurisdiction?

28:40.869 --> 28:42.370
Not anymore, Brad.

28:44.372 --> 28:45.207
Not anymore.

28:54.296 --> 28:55.714
Is there a chance
you'd go to The Rack?

28:55.964 --> 28:56.882
Sure there is.

28:57.216 --> 28:58.801
Would you rather fight them
in their backyard

28:58.801 --> 28:59.968
or later in your own?

29:01.303 --> 29:02.387
You think that over.

29:03.972 --> 29:05.808
I'll be here till 7:00,
we'll get you squared away.

29:06.392 --> 29:06.975
Good-bye.

29:08.394 --> 29:10.479
Well, Willy Loman's
got nothing on you.

29:10.562 --> 29:13.148
I do my job.
Puts more boots on the ground.

29:13.399 --> 29:15.067
Means less of our servicemen
and women get killed.

29:15.651 --> 29:17.403
I will not apologize
for my mission.

29:17.486 --> 29:18.570
Nobody's asking you to.

29:18.737 --> 29:19.988
Well, you're here for something.

29:20.239 --> 29:21.490
A couple of recruits

29:21.907 --> 29:23.409
broke into
Sergeant Hicks's house

29:23.409 --> 29:25.244
and burnt
their applications.

29:25.244 --> 29:26.495
Ah, takes more than
that to get out

29:26.495 --> 29:27.663
of your promise to
the Marine Corps.

29:28.163 --> 29:29.915
We keep the originals
here under lock and key.

29:29.915 --> 29:31.917
That's what I was hoping
you were going to say.

29:32.418 --> 29:34.169
I'm gonna need to see
everything that they stole.

29:47.182 --> 29:48.267
Here you go.

29:48.767 --> 29:49.518
Thank you.

29:54.940 --> 29:56.358
"Security risk."
What's that mean?

29:56.692 --> 29:58.944
Washington flags applications
they think are questionable.

29:59.194 --> 30:01.113
Like if a name appears
on the terrorist watch list.

30:02.114 --> 30:02.865
The watch list?

30:03.198 --> 30:04.950
Can't take a chance
with national security.

30:05.284 --> 30:06.952
There are a hundred
applications in here.

30:07.119 --> 30:08.370
Do you know
which one of these files

30:08.370 --> 30:10.038
was flagged ??

30:10.038 --> 30:11.790
Don't know. Those are
Hicks's poolies.

30:12.374 --> 30:13.959
I'm gonna need
copies of all these.

30:15.461 --> 30:16.211
Sure.

30:16.795 --> 30:17.379
Thanks.

30:22.801 --> 30:24.887
Hey, Natalia, uh...
I need the results

30:24.887 --> 30:26.472
from that tape we found
on Hicks's body.

30:27.639 --> 30:28.807
Um, why?

30:29.475 --> 30:30.893
Did you-did you
find a candidate?

30:31.477 --> 30:32.394
Yes and no.

30:32.811 --> 30:34.980
You okay?
Yeah, I'm good.

30:35.064 --> 30:38.150
Um, the tape had traces
of formaldehyde all over it.

30:38.650 --> 30:40.736
Meaning?
Meaning...

30:40.986 --> 30:43.572
formaldehyde pickles
body parts, animal parts,

30:43.572 --> 30:44.239
that kind of thing.

30:44.490 --> 30:45.908
Tape is from some place
of research.

30:45.908 --> 30:48.077
Take good pictures.
Yeah, will do.

30:53.665 --> 30:54.500
Hey, um...

30:56.418 --> 30:58.253
was... was he just
asking about me?

30:58.253 --> 30:59.755
Nick? Not at all.

31:02.257 --> 31:03.759
So my ex-husband just...

31:04.176 --> 31:06.762
comes into the lab
just to hang out?

31:07.763 --> 31:09.264
He asked me out.

31:09.598 --> 31:10.349
What did you say?

31:10.849 --> 31:12.184
I said yes.

31:13.352 --> 31:14.186
Are you mad?

31:16.855 --> 31:18.440
Not at you.

31:24.780 --> 31:26.198
(gunfire)

31:33.789 --> 31:34.456
Cooper.

31:37.376 --> 31:38.460
You found
the Kirby footage?

31:38.961 --> 31:40.546
I think I have
post-traumatic stress

31:40.546 --> 31:42.214
after all the battle
scenes I went through.

31:42.214 --> 31:43.298
But check this out.

31:46.301 --> 31:48.303
(talking indistinct)

31:48.887 --> 31:49.638
Kirby brothers.

31:50.055 --> 31:52.391
Mama, we coming home, okay.
We coming home soon.

31:52.391 --> 31:53.308
We coming home soon.

31:53.308 --> 31:55.477
We are on the way.
Need that meal, everything.

31:55.477 --> 31:57.396
COOPER:
There were three different
cameras out that day.

31:57.396 --> 31:58.981
A couple of corpsmen
and a staff sergeant.

31:59.148 --> 32:00.983
Hi, baby. I miss you.

32:01.066 --> 32:02.151
I'll be home soon.

32:03.485 --> 32:05.487
(indistinct chatter)

32:07.239 --> 32:08.407
(laughing)

32:08.407 --> 32:10.242
And this is where the day
turns upside down.

32:11.577 --> 32:12.661
PATRICK:
Incoming!
(explosion)

32:16.248 --> 32:18.000
(alarm buzzing)
Patrick!

32:20.252 --> 32:22.087
Okay, that's Kevin
taking the hit from a grenade.

32:23.505 --> 32:25.090
He's could be out for
a couple of minutes.

32:26.175 --> 32:27.176
Fast forward.

32:31.597 --> 32:32.514
There's Patrick.

32:33.265 --> 32:35.267
(gunfire)

32:36.268 --> 32:37.102
Kevin!

32:37.853 --> 32:39.938
According to the time stamp,
Kevin was unconscious

32:39.938 --> 32:41.607
while Patrick was still alive.

32:41.774 --> 32:43.108
And when he was killed.

32:43.692 --> 32:44.693
Check this out.

32:47.362 --> 32:49.364
(gunfire)

32:52.701 --> 32:54.953
I never actually found
any footage where we see

32:54.953 --> 32:56.455
Patrick getting shot.

32:56.705 --> 32:58.457
All three cameras went
out during the battle.

32:58.957 --> 33:01.794
But there's no way that your guy
could have shot his brother.

33:02.044 --> 33:03.045
He was unconscious.

33:03.879 --> 33:05.881
(gunfire)

33:07.216 --> 33:08.550
Wait a minute, Coop,
freeze that.

33:14.056 --> 33:16.392
License plates on that water
truck are from Florida.

33:16.558 --> 33:19.144
Yeah. Contractors in Iraq don't
have to register their vehicles.

33:19.395 --> 33:20.145
They just keep their own.

33:20.562 --> 33:21.980
Run those plates for me please.

33:23.399 --> 33:24.316
You think this truck has
something to do

33:24.316 --> 33:25.150
with Patrick's death?

33:31.407 --> 33:32.574
Brad Hoffman.

33:34.243 --> 33:36.245
Hoffman told us
he'd never been to Iraq.

33:41.500 --> 33:43.085
So these are
Hoffman's trucks.

33:43.419 --> 33:45.504
Yep. They were unloaded
off a transport

33:45.504 --> 33:46.588
a couple of days ago.

33:46.755 --> 33:48.590
Flagman says Hoffman
Trucking just returned

33:48.590 --> 33:50.342
from a two-year
stint in Iraq.

33:50.759 --> 33:54.263
Which means he was there at
the same time as the Kirby's.

33:54.263 --> 33:57.182
Eric, this truck on the end,
check that paint.

33:57.599 --> 33:59.101
It's the same truck
from the video.

33:59.184 --> 34:00.352
I think you're right.

34:29.797 --> 34:32.801
* *

34:42.061 --> 34:43.228
Piece of metal Alexx found

34:43.312 --> 34:45.397
in Patrick's body is
from this truck.

34:46.315 --> 34:47.483
It's from the door.

34:47.483 --> 34:51.152
The angle says that the shooter was sitting
in the driver's seat.

34:51.152 --> 34:53.989
So that means
Brad Hoffman shot Patrick Kirby

34:53.989 --> 34:55.657
and then left him there
to die, doesn't it?

34:56.658 --> 34:58.494
(gunfire)

35:02.748 --> 35:05.000
Problem is no one's heard
from Hoffman for a few days.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.585
He hasn't called
about picking up his trucks.

35:08.253 --> 35:09.338
What do you think,
he's a flight risk?

35:09.338 --> 35:10.756
He's an approved contractor.

35:10.756 --> 35:13.175
He makes it back to Iraq,
he'll disappear off the map.

35:14.009 --> 35:15.260
Let's stop him.

35:23.148 --> 35:25.818
How'd you get your
hot little hands on a terrorist watch list?

35:25.901 --> 35:28.487
The DOD is giving us
full cooperation.

35:28.654 --> 35:30.739
Boy, there are thousands
of names on this thing, huh?

35:30.739 --> 35:32.491
Yep. But all we need is one.

35:32.658 --> 35:35.160
One of a hundred
recruit plicants.

35:36.995 --> 35:38.497
Corey Stanich cleared.

35:39.581 --> 35:40.582
Bobby Childs.

35:41.083 --> 35:43.085
Feed in Derrick Perry.

35:43.502 --> 35:45.587
The blonde kid from
the shooting range.

35:45.879 --> 35:47.965
You know, being on
this list is motive enough.

35:48.215 --> 35:50.509
Once you're on it, your life
is hell in this country.

35:50.843 --> 35:52.261
Yeah, you can't get a flight,

35:53.011 --> 35:54.096
no government jobs.

35:56.181 --> 35:57.015
It's not Derrick.

35:57.891 --> 35:58.767
Try Matthew.

36:03.856 --> 36:06.191
Lakshmi and Rishad Batra?

36:07.192 --> 36:08.193
It's not Matthew.

36:08.360 --> 36:09.695
No, but those are his parents.

36:10.404 --> 36:11.864
Does it list their occupation?

36:12.281 --> 36:13.615
They're pathologists.

36:13.699 --> 36:14.950
Does that mean
anything to you?

36:15.075 --> 36:16.368
Pickled body parts.

36:16.660 --> 36:18.370
Means they use
formaldehyde.

36:20.039 --> 36:22.374
My parents are
good people, okay.

36:22.958 --> 36:25.210
Only reason why they're on that
list is where they were born.

36:25.711 --> 36:26.545
They're doctors.

36:26.712 --> 36:28.547
They pay taxes, vote.

36:28.547 --> 36:29.965
They're not terrorists.

36:30.299 --> 36:31.050
I understand.

36:33.218 --> 36:34.803
You didn't know
that's why you were rejected

36:34.803 --> 36:36.555
until you stole
the application, did you?

36:53.572 --> 36:54.448
Hicks lied to me.

36:54.740 --> 36:56.408
He said it was because
of a medical reason.

36:56.658 --> 36:57.576
Is that why you killed him?

36:58.077 --> 36:59.912
No. I didn't.

37:01.663 --> 37:03.290
I was pissed, but
I didn't kill him.

37:03.415 --> 37:05.751
Matthew,
I know that you did.

37:06.085 --> 37:06.960
The tape that was used

37:06.960 --> 37:09.296
to bind Hicks's hand
had formaldehyde on it.

37:09.296 --> 37:11.090
Your parents
are research pathologists,

37:11.256 --> 37:12.758
I know that you got the tape
from the lab.

37:14.343 --> 37:16.845
I was just trying to appeal
my case, okay, that's it.

37:18.263 --> 37:20.099
<i>Sergeant Hicks always stopped
at the gun range</i>

37:20.099 --> 37:20.849
<i>on the way home.</i>

37:20.849 --> 37:23.936
(sniffing)

37:30.442 --> 37:31.694
I need to talk to you.

37:32.361 --> 37:33.112
Not now.

37:44.498 --> 37:45.958
I swear I hardly
touched him.

37:46.291 --> 37:47.292
He was tranquilized.

37:47.543 --> 37:49.294
I didn't mean to hurt him,
he just went down.

37:49.378 --> 37:50.504
You could have called it in.

37:50.713 --> 37:53.716
Instead you bound his hands and
you dragged him to the range.

38:05.102 --> 38:05.853
I figured...

38:07.896 --> 38:10.065
if he was found there it would
look like an accident.

38:12.401 --> 38:15.988
If I called it in, with my name,
do you know how that would look?

38:16.405 --> 38:17.614
Then you know how this ends.

38:20.409 --> 38:22.286
I could have been the best
marine, you know that?

38:22.995 --> 38:24.496
I got 20/10 eyesight.

38:24.913 --> 38:26.915
I could run the 100
yard dash under ten.

38:27.166 --> 38:27.833
Hold my breath
for two minutes...

38:27.916 --> 38:29.668
Matthew, Matthew, stop.

38:31.587 --> 38:34.173
Marines are looking for people
who want to stop the killing.

38:34.173 --> 38:35.174
Not cover it up.

38:42.639 --> 38:44.850
Major Brenton,
thank you for coming in.

38:44.850 --> 38:46.685
JAG headquarters appreciates
what you're doing.

38:46.810 --> 38:47.686
Anything we can
do to help.

38:47.686 --> 38:49.146
Actually there is, Major.

38:49.146 --> 38:52.358
I need information on a
contractor named Brad Hoffman.

38:54.360 --> 38:55.402
I have reason to believe

38:55.402 --> 38:59.198
that Mr. Hoffman murdered
Patrick Kirby, Major.

39:00.616 --> 39:01.408
You have proof of this?

39:01.408 --> 39:02.284
Yes, I do.

39:02.951 --> 39:05.037
When is the next contractor
flight scheduled

39:05.037 --> 39:07.206
out of Miami due
into Baghdad?

39:08.540 --> 39:10.376
Those are pretty deep waters
you're swimming there.

39:10.542 --> 39:13.212
Need I remind you that
a US Marine has been killed.

39:16.507 --> 39:18.217
Look, all I know,

39:19.051 --> 39:21.387
contractors are always hitching
flights on corporate planes.

39:22.638 --> 39:23.806
Duhamel Industries.

39:24.139 --> 39:26.392
They carry the pharmaceutical
contract for Iraq.

39:26.683 --> 39:29.269
Has a plane bound for Baghdad,
leaving in half an hour.

39:29.812 --> 39:30.604
Thank you.

39:43.242 --> 39:46.078
(siren wailing)

39:46.078 --> 39:46.912
Brad Hoffman.

39:53.794 --> 39:55.003
Going somewhere, Brad?

39:55.879 --> 39:57.172
What, this is a private plane.

39:57.339 --> 39:59.174
Connected to a
very public murder.

39:59.174 --> 40:00.509
DELKO:
And we've got video,

40:00.759 --> 40:01.885
with your truck pulling away.

40:02.594 --> 40:05.097
And a piece of that truck
in Patrick Kirby's body.

40:07.599 --> 40:09.268
When Pat and Kev
were getting sent over,

40:10.769 --> 40:12.354
I thought I'd go
make big bucks

40:13.063 --> 40:14.189
and be near
my friends.

40:14.398 --> 40:16.608
But it didn't work out that way,
did it, Brad?

40:16.859 --> 40:18.193
It happened so fast.

40:19.069 --> 40:20.446
(gunfire)

40:27.953 --> 40:28.787
Kevin!

40:30.956 --> 40:31.707
Kevin!

40:54.980 --> 40:56.648
So you saved
your own skin

40:56.648 --> 40:58.692
and left Kevin
to take the fall.

41:00.069 --> 41:01.236
It was a war zone, man.

41:02.237 --> 41:03.238
You don't understand.

41:03.238 --> 41:05.240
I bet corporal Kirby does.

41:05.741 --> 41:07.159
I bet he does.

42:39.043 --> 42:41.086
