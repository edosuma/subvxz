WEBVTT

00:05.600 --> 00:08.262
- COME ON, NIO.

00:08.300 --> 00:10.200
SHOW US THE GOODS.

00:10.240 --> 00:13.107
LISTEN UP, THE MINUTE NIO
REVEALS HIS STASH, WE MOVE.

00:13.140 --> 00:14.539
[knock at door]

00:14.580 --> 00:17.299
- WAIT, SOMEBODY'S AT THE DOOR.

00:17.350 --> 00:20.148
- I HAVE YOUR LUNCH,
MR. BAEZ.

00:20.180 --> 00:22.785
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

00:22.820 --> 00:24.287
THIS COULDN'T GET
ANY MORE RIDICULOUS.

00:24.320 --> 00:27.585
- IT'S NOT MY FAULT.
IT'S DON'S.

00:27.620 --> 00:30.180
- I WAS WRONG.
OH, JEEZ.

00:30.230 --> 00:32.095
- OH, NO.

00:32.130 --> 00:34.348
- I'M JUST DOING MY JOB, SIR.
- AHA.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.061
- OH.

00:36.100 --> 00:37.567
- WE SHOULD GET IN THERE.

00:37.600 --> 00:40.694
- EH, JUST HOLD ON THERE.
KEEP--KEEP GOING.

00:40.740 --> 00:42.162
- WE WERE NOT
UNDER THE IMPRESSION

00:42.210 --> 00:43.029
THAT YOU WOULD BE ARMED.

00:43.070 --> 00:44.469
- YOU'RE SELLING
THESE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS

00:44.510 --> 00:46.137
RIGHT OUT OF THIS HOTEL ROOM?
- YEAH, SURE.

00:46.180 --> 00:47.238
- DID YOU GET THAT?

00:47.280 --> 00:48.702
LET'S MOVE.

00:48.740 --> 00:50.776
- WHEN I'M NOT ON THE STREET,
WIPING OUT--UGH!

00:50.810 --> 00:53.244
[gunshot]
- CRAP.

00:53.280 --> 00:57.080
- DON'T MOVE!
DON'T YOU FRICKIN' MOVE!

00:57.120 --> 00:58.678
LASSIE.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.779
WE TOTALLY CAUGHT
THE BAD GUYS.

01:02.790 --> 01:04.257
- AGH.
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

01:04.290 --> 01:06.224
YOU CRASHED OUR STAKEOUT.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

01:10.700 --> 01:13.089
- YOU THINK THE CHIEF CALLED US
IN TO CONGRATULATE US

01:13.140 --> 01:15.096
ON OUR BUST YESTERDAY?
- MOST DEFINITELY.

01:15.140 --> 01:17.267
I'M ALSO ASSUMING THAT THERE
WILL BE AN AWARD INVOLVED.

01:17.310 --> 01:18.459
- A "BUSTY"?

01:18.510 --> 01:20.205
- I WAS THINKING
LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT.

01:20.240 --> 01:21.878
"BUSTIES" USUALLY GO
TO STRIPPERS OR SCULPTORS.

01:21.910 --> 01:23.639
LIONEL RICEIAE HAS ONE.

01:23.680 --> 01:25.238
- ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
LISTEN UP,

01:25.280 --> 01:27.339
THIS MORNING ANOTHER
CHECK-CASHING ESTABLISHMENT

01:27.380 --> 01:29.439
WAS ROBBED AT GUNPOINT.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.811
IT, LIKE THE OTHERS, IS OWNED
BY DEVRY LONGSDALE.

01:31.850 --> 01:34.159
LONGSDALE IS A TWO-BIT GANGSTER

01:34.190 --> 01:36.750
WHO RUNS ONE OF THE SLEAZIEST
OPERATIONS IN TOWN.

01:36.790 --> 01:38.587
IN FACT, I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
IF HE'S BEING RIPPED OFF

01:38.630 --> 01:40.359
BY SOME OTHER LOWLIFE
THAT HE'S DOUBLE-CROSSED.

01:40.400 --> 01:43.665
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE SEPARATE
OUR FEELINGS ABOUT LONGSDALE

01:43.700 --> 01:45.429
FROM THE FACT
THAT WHOEVER'S ROBBING HIM

01:45.470 --> 01:47.529
IS BREAKING THE LAW AND NEEDS
TO BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE.

01:47.570 --> 01:49.208
- AND WE HAVE STRONG REASON
TO BELIEVE,

01:49.240 --> 01:51.162
BASED ON
SECURITY-VIDEO FOOTAGE,

01:51.210 --> 01:54.407
THAT THIS PERSON
IS A MR. DAVID ARNOLD.

01:54.440 --> 01:56.249
- OH.
- HE IS 35 YEARS OF AGE

01:56.280 --> 01:57.804
AND SERVED SEVEN YEARS
FOR ARMED ROBBERY.

01:57.850 --> 01:59.442
- HE DISABLES THE ALARM,

01:59.480 --> 02:00.674
GETS IN AND OUT
IN UNDER FIVE MINUTES.

02:00.720 --> 02:02.688
HE IS ALL BUSINESS.
- BUT ONLY UP FRONT.

02:02.720 --> 02:04.688
AROUND BACK, THERE IS
A MAJOR PARTY GOING ON.

02:04.720 --> 02:06.881
- [laughs]

02:06.920 --> 02:10.219
- MR. SPENCER, MR. GUSTER,
MY OFFICE NOW.

02:10.260 --> 02:13.252
- EXCUSE US. GUS AND I HAVE
TO GO RECEIVE PROPS NOW.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.425
- COMMANDER.
- MR. SPENCER.

02:17.470 --> 02:18.596
- YESTERDAY'S STUNT

02:18.630 --> 02:21.895
MAY BE THE MOST ASININE
AND IDIOTIC THING

02:21.940 --> 02:24.761
I'VE SEEN IN ALL MY YEARS
AT THIS DEPARTMENT.

02:24.810 --> 02:26.209
- THAT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE PROPS.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.172
- SHE'S ROASTING US.
- OH.

02:27.210 --> 02:28.837
- WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK
YOU WERE DOING?

02:28.880 --> 02:30.802
- OH, I DON'T KNOW,
CATCHING THE BAD GUYS.

02:30.850 --> 02:34.274
[both laughing]

02:35.850 --> 02:38.648
- I HIRED YOU TO ASSIST LASSITER
IN TAKING DOWN BAEZ,

02:38.690 --> 02:40.351
NOT GO ROGUE.

02:40.390 --> 02:41.482
- YEAH.

02:41.520 --> 02:42.555
I TOLD HIM OVER A WEEK AGO

02:42.590 --> 02:44.751
THAT I SENSED BAEZ WAS WORKING
OUT OF THAT HOTEL,

02:44.790 --> 02:46.257
AND HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.892
- HE WAS SETTING UP
A STING, SHAWN.

02:47.930 --> 02:49.693
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THAT INVOLVES?

02:49.730 --> 02:51.960
- NEWMAN, REDFORD,
THE LADIES,

02:52.000 --> 02:53.695
THE PONIES.

02:53.740 --> 02:57.335
- WIRETAPS, SEARCH WARRANTS,
SURVEILLANCE TEAMS,

02:57.370 --> 02:58.439
ALL OF WHICH TAKE TIME.

02:58.470 --> 03:00.779
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING
FOR YOU TO WORRY ABOUT.

03:00.810 --> 03:02.846
WHAT WE LIKE TO DO
IS COME UP WITH A SOLUTION

03:02.880 --> 03:03.972
AND MAKE IT HAPPEN.

03:04.010 --> 03:05.648
- NOT ALWAYS IN THAT ORDER.

03:05.680 --> 03:07.477
- WELL, I CAN'T AFFORD
TO HIRE YOU

03:07.520 --> 03:10.512
ON ANY MORE CASES
WHEN YOU HAVE ZERO UNDERSTANDING

03:10.550 --> 03:12.256
OF BASIC POLICE PROCEDURE.

03:12.290 --> 03:13.882
- IN THE END,
WE ALWAYS COME THROUGH.

03:13.920 --> 03:15.911
- JUST LIKE THE CHAIRMAN
OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE.

03:15.960 --> 03:18.258
- I'M NOT PUTTING YOU ON
ANOTHER CASE UNTIL YOU ACQUIRE

03:18.290 --> 03:20.497
A FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING

03:20.530 --> 03:22.259
OF THE WAY POLICE OPERATE.

03:22.300 --> 03:25.565
- FINE. WE'LL DUST OFF
OUR CHiPs DVDs AND MEET YOU

03:25.600 --> 03:27.898
BACK HERE MONDAY MORNING.
- BEST HOMEWORK EVER.

03:27.940 --> 03:31.307
- I'M AFRAID THAT'S NOT GOING
TO CUT IT.

03:31.340 --> 03:32.932
HENRY.
- WE'VE ORGANIZED FOR BOTH

03:32.980 --> 03:35.676
OF YOU TO PARTICIPATE
IN A THREE-WEEK CRASH COURSE

03:35.710 --> 03:37.803
AT THE POLICE ACADEMY.

03:37.850 --> 03:39.909
- WHAT?
- BOING.

03:39.950 --> 03:42.418
- I HAVE TO WARN YOU
THIS IS GOING TO BE CHALLENGING.

03:42.450 --> 03:44.714
- OHH.
- COME ON, SON.

03:44.750 --> 03:45.648
- DON'T WORRY.

03:45.690 --> 03:48.818
WE--WE KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT WE NEED TO DO.

03:48.860 --> 03:50.555
WE MAKE FUNNY SOUND EFFECTS
WITH OUR MOUTHS,

03:50.590 --> 03:51.989
STAY ON BUBBA SMITH'S
GOOD SIDE.

03:52.030 --> 03:53.998
GUS, GIVE ME
SOME MACHINE-GUN ACTION.

03:54.030 --> 03:58.023
- BRRRR.

03:58.070 --> 04:02.336
- I SAID MACHINE GUN.
- I KNOW. THAT WAS A AK-47.

04:02.370 --> 04:04.338
- NO, I WAS TALKING
ABOUT THE FIREARM.

04:04.370 --> 04:05.667
- THIS ISN'T A MOVIE, SHAWN.

04:05.710 --> 04:07.371
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO EXHIBIT DISCIPLINE,

04:07.410 --> 04:08.479
A RESPECT FOR AUTHORITY,

04:08.510 --> 04:10.603
A WILLINGNESS
TO FOLLOW THE RULES,

04:10.650 --> 04:12.049
NONE OF WHICH
ARE YOUR STRONG SUIT.

04:12.080 --> 04:14.446
- YOU JUST TELL ME
WHEN AND WHERE.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.584
THIS IS A REBECCA LOBO LAYUP.

04:16.620 --> 04:17.644
- OKAY.

04:17.690 --> 04:20.818
YOU HAVE TO REPORT
TO THE ACADEMY DOWNTOWN AT NOON.

04:20.860 --> 04:22.009
- NOON?

04:22.060 --> 04:24.984
THAT MEANS WE HAVE FOUR HOURS.

04:25.030 --> 04:28.557
- FOUR HOURS?
NO.

04:28.600 --> 04:31.421
IT'S 11:00 AM.
- I KNOW.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.431
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

04:35.470 --> 04:36.459
*

04:36.510 --> 04:38.068
- * I KNOW YOU KNOW

04:38.110 --> 04:40.431
* THAT I'M NOT TELLING
THE TRUTH *

04:40.480 --> 04:42.448
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

04:42.480 --> 04:43.902
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF *

04:43.950 --> 04:45.440
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

04:45.480 --> 04:46.970
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

04:47.020 --> 04:48.544
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

04:48.580 --> 04:50.810
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

04:50.850 --> 04:53.614
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

04:55.690 --> 04:57.658
- SO CHIEF VICK TOLD ME
YOU TWO WERE PSYCHICS.

04:57.690 --> 04:59.396
- THAT'S JUST ME, SIR.

04:59.430 --> 05:00.658
- I'M A PHARMACEUTICAL
SALESMAN, SIR.

05:00.700 --> 05:03.419
- YOU DON'T NEED TO FINISH EVERY
SENTENCE WITH THE WORD "SIR."

05:03.470 --> 05:04.926
- BUT IT FEELS FUN
AND SILLY, SIR.

05:04.970 --> 05:07.689
- WELL, KNOCK IT OFF.

05:07.740 --> 05:09.367
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TWO WEARING, ANYWAY?

05:09.410 --> 05:11.731
- THESE ARE OFFICIAL
POLICE ACADEMY SWEAT OUTFITS.

05:11.770 --> 05:12.668
- I'VE NEVER SEEN 'EM BEFORE.

05:12.710 --> 05:14.735
- THEN YOU'VE NEVER SEEN
ANY OF THE MOVIES.

05:14.780 --> 05:16.577
THESE ARE EXACT REPLICAS.

05:16.610 --> 05:18.646
IF YOU GIVE GUS YOUR SIZES,
HE'LL MAKE YOU ONE AS WELL.

05:18.680 --> 05:21.444
- LET ME MAKE ONE THING
VERY CLEAR, GENTLEMEN.

05:21.480 --> 05:22.845
THIS IS NOT SUMMER CAMP.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.983
FOR THE NEXT THREE WEEKS,
I WILL BE PUTTING YOU

05:25.020 --> 05:28.456
THROUGH AN INTENSE PROGRAM
DESIGNED TO MAKE YOU THINK, ACT,

05:28.490 --> 05:31.527
AND BEHAVE
LIKE OFFICERS OF THE LAW.

05:31.560 --> 05:34.825
PREPARE TO BE PUSHED
TO YOUR PHYSICAL, MENTAL, AND,

05:34.860 --> 05:36.691
YES, EMOTIONAL LIMITS.

05:36.730 --> 05:39.767
- WARNING--GUS HERE'S
A BIG WEEPER.

05:39.800 --> 05:40.732
- SAYS THE GUY WHO BROKE DOWN

05:40.770 --> 05:43.000
WHILE WATCHING A COMMERCIAL
THIS MORNING.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.600
- THERE WERE ABUSED PUPPIES
AND A SARAH MCLACHLAN SONG.

05:45.640 --> 05:46.732
I AM NOT A ROBOT.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.668
- GOOD.
WANTED TO MAKE SURE YOU TWO

05:48.710 --> 05:51.042
DIDN'T SNAKE OUT OF THIS.

05:51.080 --> 05:55.369
NICK CONFORTH?

05:55.420 --> 05:57.388
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE STILL ON THE FORCE.

05:57.420 --> 05:58.887
- HELLO, LASSITER.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.512
- HOW DO YOU TWO KNOW
EACH OTHER?

06:00.560 --> 06:01.754
- US?

06:01.790 --> 06:03.678
WE'RE OLD PALS
FROM THE ACADEMY.

06:03.730 --> 06:05.721
- WE HAD AN ONGOING BATTLE
AS TO WHO WOULD GRADUATE

06:05.760 --> 06:08.422
IN THE TOP SPOT--I WON.

06:08.460 --> 06:10.667
- THAT'S PROBABLY 'CAUSE
YOU CHEATED ON THAT FINAL EXAM.

06:10.700 --> 06:12.065
- I EARNED THAT SPOT
FAIR AND SQUARE.

06:12.100 --> 06:13.533
- IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU TWO

06:13.570 --> 06:14.832
HAVE PUT ALL THIS OLD STUFF
BEHIND YOU.

06:14.870 --> 06:18.033
- EH, LOOK, NONE OF THAT
MATTERS NOW, DOES IT?

06:18.070 --> 06:20.607
BECAUSE I'M HEAD DETECTIVE
OF THE S.B.P.D.,

06:20.640 --> 06:23.609
AND YOU'RE--

06:23.650 --> 06:25.709
YOU'RE CLEARLY DOING WELL.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.445
- I'M THE ASSOCIATE HEAD
OF THIS ACADEMY,

06:27.480 --> 06:29.038
IN CHARGE
OF ALL CADET TRAINING.

06:29.080 --> 06:31.048
- COOL.
HEY, LOOK AT THAT.

06:31.090 --> 06:32.785
THEY EVEN GIVE YOU
YOUR OWN BADGE.

06:32.820 --> 06:34.856
- IT JUST TURNS OUT
MY HEART WAS IN TEACHING.

06:34.890 --> 06:37.825
- LOOK, THERE IS
NO JUDGMENT HERE.

06:37.860 --> 06:40.727
IF YOU EVER WANT
A REAL-LIFE EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE

06:40.760 --> 06:42.728
WHO CATCHES BAD GUYS
FOR A LIVING,

06:42.770 --> 06:45.125
I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY
TO COME TALK TO YOUR STUDENTS.

06:45.170 --> 06:46.762
[loud thud]

06:46.800 --> 06:48.062
- DON'T YOU FORGET
THAT I WORKED

06:48.100 --> 06:50.967
IN THE FIELD TOO,
DETECTIVE.

06:51.010 --> 06:53.171
- THAT'S RIGHT.
WHAT WAS THAT, SIX MONTHS?

06:53.210 --> 06:55.633
SIX MONTHS YOU DID THAT.
THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

06:55.680 --> 06:58.069
'CAUSE I-I-I DON'T--
I DON'T REMEMBER, CONFORTH.

06:58.110 --> 07:01.716
- SUSPICIOUS PERSON,

- EXCUSE ME.
DUTY CALLS.

07:04.020 --> 07:08.081
- COPY, LASSITER RESPONDING.
E.T.A., 15 MINUTES.

07:08.120 --> 07:09.678
I GOT TO GO.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.686
REALLY GOOD SEEING YOU,
CONFORTH.

07:11.730 --> 07:13.891
HAVE FUN
WITH THESE CLOWNS.

07:18.770 --> 07:21.534
- IS HE REALLY HEAD DETECTIVE?
- I'M AFRAID SO.

07:21.570 --> 07:24.130
- OFFICER CONFORTH,
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT I MAY TAKE

07:24.170 --> 07:25.569
A LITTLE SNACK BREAK.

07:25.610 --> 07:26.838
I HAVEN'T HAD ANYTHING
SINCE 2:00.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.836
- IT'S 2:15.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

07:28.880 --> 07:32.099
- IS THAT A FIRE ALARM?
- I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.

07:32.150 --> 07:35.642
- [imitates alarm beeping]

07:35.680 --> 07:37.989
- WHY IS HE MAKING
WEIRD CAT NOISES?

07:38.020 --> 07:40.614
- YOU HAVE TO STOP.
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING YOURSELF.

07:40.660 --> 07:42.821
- LISTEN, YOUR PROGRAM
BREAKS DOWN AS FOLLOWS.

07:42.860 --> 07:44.487
A THIRD WILL BE SPENT
IN THE CLASSROOM.

07:44.530 --> 07:45.622
A THIRD WILL INVOLVE FIELDWORK.

07:45.660 --> 07:47.958
AND ONE-THIRD WILL BE FOCUSED
ON PHYSICAL TRAINING.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.821
- WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER THIRD?
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

07:50.870 --> 07:53.498
- NEVER MIND.
SURPRISE US.

08:32.310 --> 08:33.732
[gunshot]

08:39.950 --> 08:41.247
- AND FALL
INTO THAT DISGUSTING-ASS WATER?

08:41.280 --> 08:43.282
I'LL GET DYSENTERY, SHAWN.

08:47.620 --> 08:50.623
[gunshots]

08:55.630 --> 08:56.892
HOW DID THIS IMPROVE
THE SITUATION?

08:56.930 --> 08:59.899
- WHAT IS DYSENTERY?

09:05.310 --> 09:08.199
- TIME!

09:10.350 --> 09:13.649
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU ARE HENRY SPENCER'S SON.

09:13.680 --> 09:14.772
- WELL, NEITHER CAN I.

09:14.820 --> 09:15.775
IT'S AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION,

09:15.820 --> 09:18.789
AND IN MY DEFENSE,
I HAD REASONABLE SUSPICION

09:18.820 --> 09:20.651
FOR ALL OF THOSE
CARDBOARD PEOPLE THAT I SHOT.

09:20.690 --> 09:22.829
- YOU SHOT TWO INNOCENT WOMEN.

09:22.860 --> 09:26.023
- IF I MAY, THE FIRST WOMAN
WITH THE GROCERIES

09:26.060 --> 09:28.051
WAS EXITING A LIBRARY
THAT DOESN'T ALLOW SNACKS.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.762
I KNOW THIS BECAUSE WE'VE TRIED
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.

09:30.800 --> 09:33.064
AND THE SECOND WOMAN WAS SIMPLY
A REPLICA OF THE FIRST WOMAN,

09:33.100 --> 09:35.091
BUT THEY PAINTED HER FACE BROWN,
WHICH IS BOTH OFFENSIVE

09:35.140 --> 09:36.129
AND SUSPICIOUS.

09:36.170 --> 09:37.808
- BUT YOU SHOT HER THREE TIMES.

09:37.840 --> 09:39.034
- SEMANTICS.
- IT'S NOT SEMANTICS.

09:39.070 --> 09:41.379
- HOW CAN YOU TWO BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR SOLVING ALL TH ESE CASES?

09:41.410 --> 09:42.775
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU GET OUT OF BED

09:42.810 --> 09:44.641
IN THE MORNING
WITHOUT HURTING YOURSELVES.

09:44.680 --> 09:47.808
- OH, BUT WE DO AND INJURY-FREE
SINCE JUNE OF LAST YEAR,

09:47.850 --> 09:48.669
WHEN GUS BROKE HIS FINGER

09:48.720 --> 09:51.814
FLIPPING
THE INJURY-COUNTDOWN CALENDAR.

09:51.850 --> 09:52.851
WAIT, THAT'S IRONY, RIGHT?

09:52.890 --> 09:54.209
- IRONY IS YOU ASKING ME

09:54.260 --> 09:56.148
WHAT IRONY MEANS
EVERY TIME YOU SAY IT.

09:56.190 --> 09:59.921
- ALL RIGHT, MAYBE YOU'LL DO
BETTER IN THE FIELD.

09:59.960 --> 10:02.224
TODAY WE WILL BE PATROLLING
A DESIGNATED AREA

10:02.260 --> 10:05.093
UNDER THE CLOSE SUPERVISION
OF MYSELF AND FENWAY.

10:05.130 --> 10:07.792
- WHO'S FENWAY?
- THAT GUY RIGHT OVER THERE.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.398
- OH.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.931
- BEST SCENT DOG
IN THE STATE.

10:11.970 --> 10:14.279
PLAYED A ROLE
IN SOLVING OVER 50 CASES.

10:14.310 --> 10:15.937
- ALSO PLAYED ROLES
IN THE BAD NEWS BEARS,

10:15.980 --> 10:18.847
THE ODD COUPLE,
AND GRUMPY OLD MEN.

10:18.880 --> 10:20.848
- [laughing] HE DOES LOOK
LIKE WALTER MATI'HAU.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.711
- [barks]

10:22.750 --> 10:24.047
- HERE ARE YOUR UNIFORMS.

10:24.090 --> 10:25.887
THE BADGES ARE TEMPORARY.

10:25.920 --> 10:27.854
THE GUNS, THANK GOD,
ARE PROPS,

10:27.890 --> 10:30.779
BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS WHAT'S
ISSUED TO OUR CURRENT OFFICERS.

10:30.830 --> 10:32.798
THESE ARE NOT TOYS, GENTLEMEN!

10:32.830 --> 10:34.798
AN OFFICER'S EQUIPMENT
IS TO BE GUARDED

10:34.830 --> 10:36.798
AND ACCOUNTED FOR
AT ALL TIMES.

10:36.830 --> 10:38.320
IS THAT CLEAR?
- YES, SENSEI.

10:38.370 --> 10:41.168
- SO ON PATROL TODAY, CAN WE
PULL PEOPLE OVER AND STUFF?

10:41.200 --> 10:45.330
- YES, AS LONG
AS THERE'S PROBABLE CAUSE.

10:45.370 --> 10:48.203
[siren wailing]

10:48.240 --> 10:49.901
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

10:49.950 --> 10:54.410
[indistinct radio chatter]

10:54.450 --> 10:56.839
- [sighs]

10:59.760 --> 11:01.978
SIR, I'M GONNA NEED
TO SEE YOUR LICENSE

11:02.020 --> 11:03.328
AND REGISTRATION, PLEASE.

11:03.360 --> 11:04.952
- SPENCER, YOU MUST BE
OUT OF YOUR DAMN MIND

11:04.990 --> 11:06.719
IF YOU THINK
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

11:06.760 --> 11:08.899
- LICENSE AND REGISTRATION,
PLEASE, SIR.

11:08.930 --> 11:10.090
- HEY!

11:10.130 --> 11:13.361
HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING, SIR?
- THAT'S IT.

11:13.400 --> 11:15.061
- SIR, IF YOU DON'T CALM DOWN,
I WILL BE FORCED

11:15.100 --> 11:16.260
TO TASE YOU IN THE FACE.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.006
- YOU DON'T HAVE A TASER.

11:18.040 --> 11:20.873
OHH.
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

11:20.910 --> 11:23.447
- YOU WERE DOING 45
IN A 40.

11:23.480 --> 11:25.300
THE LAW IS THE LAW.

11:25.350 --> 11:26.942
- WHAT THE HELL, CONFORTH?
YOU CAN'T BEAT ME ON THE FIELD,

11:26.980 --> 11:28.743
SO NOW YOU'RE TRYING
TO BEAT ME OFF?

11:28.780 --> 11:30.418
- YOU MAY WANT
TO REPHRASE THAT, SIR.

11:30.450 --> 11:31.485
- MAYBE HE HAS BEEN DRINKING.

11:31.520 --> 11:32.987
- SIR, I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO STAND

11:33.020 --> 11:34.988
ON ONE FOOT AND HOP
AT A MEDIUM PACE.

11:35.020 --> 11:37.750
- ALL UNITS,
WE HAVE A ROBBERY IN PROGRESS

11:37.790 --> 11:40.054
AT LONGSDALE'S CHECK CASHING,
WILCOX AND SHIRE.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.226
- YOU THREE CLOWNS STAY HERE.

11:41.260 --> 11:43.228
I'M GONNA GO DO
SOME REAL POLICE WORK.

11:45.070 --> 11:47.061
YOU'RE PATHETIC, CONFORTH.

11:47.100 --> 11:49.091
[engine turning]

11:49.140 --> 11:52.359
[tires squealing]

11:52.410 --> 11:53.479
- DAMN.

11:53.510 --> 11:54.670
- DON'T LET HIM GET
TO YOU, NICK.

11:54.710 --> 11:57.440
- NO, HE'S RIGHT. I AM PATHETIC.
WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING?

11:57.480 --> 11:59.812
- I'LL TELL YOU EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

11:59.850 --> 12:01.249
YOU'RE TEACHING REFINED SKILLS

12:01.280 --> 12:03.942
THAT GUYS LIKE US
CAN UTILIZE FOR WEEKS,

12:03.990 --> 12:05.218
MOST LIKELY DAYS.

12:05.250 --> 12:06.512
SERIOUSLY,
FOR THE TEN HOURS OR SO

12:06.550 --> 12:09.212
THAT WE RETAIN THE STUFF
THAT YOU'VE TAUGHT US,

12:09.260 --> 12:10.750
YOU MADE
A REAL DIFFERENCE, NICK.

12:10.790 --> 12:12.519
- I AM TWICE THE COP
THAT HE IS.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.528
- WELL, DON'T JUST STAND THERE
AND WAX ON ABOUT IT.

12:14.560 --> 12:16.994
DID YOU NOTICE
THAT HE TOOK THE FREEWAY?

12:17.030 --> 12:18.793
- SO?
- SO?

12:18.830 --> 12:20.832
HE JUST ADDED TEN MINUTES
TO HIS TRIP.

12:20.870 --> 12:22.497
WE CAN GET YOU THERE
IN UNDER FIVE.

12:22.540 --> 12:24.428
- JUST IN TIME
TO BUST THE PERP.

12:24.470 --> 12:26.802
- NO. NO. NO WAY. YOU KNOW WHAT
KIND OF TROUBLE I'D GET INTO

12:26.840 --> 12:28.899
GETTING TWO CADETS INVOLVED
IN AN ACTIVE ROBBERY? NO.

12:28.940 --> 12:30.043
- THINK ABOUT IT, NICK.

12:30.080 --> 12:33.447
THIS IS FINALLY A CHANCE
TO SHOW HIM UP ONCE AND FOR ALL.

12:35.050 --> 12:38.508
- IF WE DO THIS,
WE GOT TO CATCH THE BAD GUYS.

12:38.550 --> 12:40.211
- DON'T WORRY, NICK.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.752
IT'S OUR SPECIALTY.

12:48.830 --> 12:51.196
- SLOW DOWN.
IT'S JUST UP HERE ON THE LEI-T.

12:51.230 --> 12:52.891
HOLY CRAP.
THAT'S THE GUY.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.339
- STOP THE CAR.

12:54.370 --> 12:59.000
- STOP.
STOP RIGHT HERE.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.837
- GAH!

13:00.880 --> 13:03.144
LET'S GO, NICK.

13:03.180 --> 13:04.408
- NICK!

13:06.550 --> 13:07.517
NICK.

13:07.550 --> 13:10.212
- I UNDERSTAND
WHY HE WENT BACK TO TEACHING.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.969
- HE'S HEADED
TOWARDS THE COLLEGE OVER THERE.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.901
- I GUESS THAT OBSTACLE COURSE
DOES HAVE A PRACTICAL PURPOSE.

13:37.610 --> 13:39.475
EVERYBODY, LISTEN UP!

13:39.510 --> 13:41.842
COME OUT OF YOUR DORM ROOMS!

13:41.880 --> 13:44.041
WE ARE LOOKING
FOR A REDNECK...

13:44.090 --> 13:46.149
- HELLO.
- WITH A BLACK BACKPACK,

13:46.190 --> 13:48.886
AND WE'RE PRETTY SURE
HE CAME DOWN THIS HALLWAY.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.922
- SCREW YOU, CADET.

13:54.100 --> 13:56.250
- UH, HE--HE WENT
RIGHT OUT THERE.

14:04.640 --> 14:06.505
- GUSTER, ANY LUCK?

14:06.540 --> 14:09.600
- THAT'S A NEGATIVE.

14:09.640 --> 14:13.144
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS,
LIKE, FIREMEN?

14:16.120 --> 14:17.485
- DON'T SWEAT IT, NICK.

14:17.520 --> 14:19.442
AND LASSIE DOESN'T NEED
TO HEAR ABOUT THIS.

14:19.490 --> 14:21.082
OKAY?

14:21.120 --> 14:23.259
- TOO LATE, IDIOTS.

14:34.200 --> 14:36.065
- WHERE'S MR. GUSTER?

14:36.100 --> 14:38.068
- WELL, CHIEF,
I'M GONNA BE FRANK WITH YOU.

14:38.110 --> 14:41.034
GUS HAD A TUNA--
POSSIBLY CHICKEN-SALAD SANDWICH

14:41.080 --> 14:42.308
FROM THE VENDING MACHINE,

14:42.340 --> 14:44.547
AND THAT, COMBINED WITH THE FACT
THAT WE'RE IN HOT WATER AGAIN,

14:44.580 --> 14:46.275
PUT HIS STOMACH
ON THE FRITZ.

14:46.310 --> 14:48.073
- HOW LONG WILL HE BE?

14:48.120 --> 14:52.079
- 35, 40 MINUTES, TOPS.

14:52.120 --> 14:54.111
- WELL, YOU CAN FILL
HIM IN YOURSELF.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.411
OFFICER CONFORTH,

14:55.460 --> 14:58.429
YOU DROVE TWO CADETS
TO A ROBBERY IN PROGRESS,

14:58.460 --> 15:01.998
AND YOU LET THEM CHASE A SUSPECT
WHILE YOU DID WHAT EXACTLY?

15:02.030 --> 15:04.919
- I'M NOT SURE
IT'S IMPORTANT, CHIEF.

15:04.970 --> 15:07.689
- I HAVE AN EDUCATED GUESS
THAT'S 100% ACCURATE.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.538
OFFICER CONFORTH HERE FROZE
LIKE THE NORTH POLE,

15:13.980 --> 15:15.504
THEY BLINK REPEATEDLY,

15:15.540 --> 15:18.373
LIKE THEY'RE STARING
INTO THE SUN.

15:18.410 --> 15:19.707
SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE, HUH?

15:19.750 --> 15:20.774
- WELL, UNFORTU NATELY,

15:20.820 --> 15:23.948
I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO SUSPEND
YOU FOR ONE MONTH,

15:23.990 --> 15:25.514
PENDING A FULL INVESTIGATION.

15:25.550 --> 15:29.088
- NO. COME ON, CHIEF, DON'T YOU
THINK THAT'S A LITTLE HARSH?

15:29.120 --> 15:32.089
- MR. SPENCER, YOU'RE IN NO
POSITION TO BE DEFENDING ANYONE.

15:32.130 --> 15:33.995
YOU WERE TOLD
NOT TO PARTICIPATE

15:34.030 --> 15:36.351
IN ANY INVESTIGATIONS UNTIL YOU
COMPLETED YOUR TRAINING,

15:36.400 --> 15:39.699
AND THEN YOU IGNORED ME
WHILE SOMEHOW MANAGING TO LOSE

15:39.730 --> 15:41.493
HALF YOUR EQUIPMENT
IN THE PROCESS.

15:41.540 --> 15:42.689
- WHAT?

15:42.740 --> 15:44.264
I LOST MY HAT
AND MY FLASHLIGHT.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.039
- WHERE'S YOUR RADIO?

15:46.070 --> 15:47.571
- BOOM.

15:47.610 --> 15:49.669
- [sighs]

15:49.710 --> 15:53.339
- AND MY RADIO--
I LOST THAT.

15:53.380 --> 15:55.541
LOOK, A GUY CAN ONLY CARRY
SO MUCH STUFF, CHIEF.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.218
- YOU AND MR. GUSTER

15:57.250 --> 15:59.616
ARE TO RETURN
TO THE ACADEMY IMMEDIATELY.

15:59.650 --> 16:01.754
- WE'D LOVE TO DO THAT
FOR YOU, CHIEF,

16:01.790 --> 16:04.054
BUT YOU JUST SUSPENDED
OUR INSTRUCTOR.

16:04.090 --> 16:06.058
AND I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE
GUS IS GONNA MAKE IT

16:06.090 --> 16:06.886
OUT OF THE LATRINE.

16:06.930 --> 16:08.989
- WELL, YOU NOW HAVE
A SUBSTITUTE,

16:09.030 --> 16:10.019
ONE THAT I HAVE HANDPICKED

16:10.070 --> 16:13.130
TO ENSURE THAT THERE WILL BE
NO MORE INCIDENTS.

16:13.170 --> 16:15.365
- THIS MANEUVER IS CALLED

16:15.400 --> 16:19.109
THE PRECISION IMMOBILIZATION
TECHNIQUE, OR THE PIT METHOD.

16:19.140 --> 16:21.438
IT IS WHEN ONE CAR
PURSUING ANOTHER

16:21.480 --> 16:23.471
FORCES THE PURSUED VEHICLE
TO ABRUPTLY HALT.

16:23.510 --> 16:25.046
YOU MAY WANT
TO WRITE THIS DOWN.

16:25.080 --> 16:27.344
- DUDE, THIS IS SO TOP GUN.
- HMM.

16:27.380 --> 16:29.439
- I'M CRUISE.
SHE'S MCGILLIS.

16:29.480 --> 16:30.788
YOU'RE SUNDOWN.

16:30.820 --> 16:32.481
- WHY CAN'T I BE THE GOOSE?
- YOU KNOW WHY.

16:32.520 --> 16:34.750
- STOP HYPOTHETICALLY
TYPECASTING ME, SHAWN.

16:34.790 --> 16:36.587
- COME ON, IT MEANS
YOU WERE ALSO IN DIE HARD

16:36.620 --> 16:38.554
AND ALL THOSE EPISODES
OF WALKER, TEXAS RANGER.

16:38.590 --> 16:39.727
- I WANT TO BE THE BLACK GOOSE.

16:39.760 --> 16:41.557
- I CAN'T DO THIS
WITH YOUR RIGHT NOW.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.091
- FINE.
- YES, MR. SPENCER.

16:44.130 --> 16:46.189
- HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
A SMALL, BLUE VEHICLE

16:46.230 --> 16:48.790
SWING OUT IN FRONT
OF A TWIN MACK TRUCK,

16:48.840 --> 16:50.762
PULL A 180 SPIN,

16:50.810 --> 16:52.209
AND THEN CONTINUE IN REVERSE

16:52.240 --> 16:54.435
WHILE MAINTAINING
BOTH SPEED AND CONTROL?

16:54.480 --> 16:57.142
- NO. AND WHY WOULD SOMEONE
DO SOMETHING SO STUPID?

16:57.180 --> 16:59.546
- TO COMMUNICATE.

16:59.580 --> 17:03.141
- YOU KNOW, TO KEEP UP
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.

17:03.190 --> 17:04.111
- DO YOU HAVE
ANY REAL QUESTIONS,

17:04.150 --> 17:05.481
OR WOULD YOU RATHER
KEEP WASTING OUR TIME?

17:05.520 --> 17:07.249
- WELL,
HYPOTHETICALLY SPEAKING,

17:07.290 --> 17:11.158
LET'S SAY THERE'S A GUY KNOCKING
OFF CHECK-CASHING PLACES

17:11.190 --> 17:13.090
IN ORDER TO GATHER--
- THAT'S NOT HYPOTHETICAL.

17:13.130 --> 17:15.098
THAT IS A REAL AND CURRENT CASE
WE ARE NOT DISCUSSING

17:15.130 --> 17:17.189
IN THIS CLASS.
- UNDERSTOOD.

17:19.770 --> 17:21.829
- YES, MR. SPENCER.

17:21.870 --> 17:25.101
- LET'S SAY THERE'S A LADY,
AND SHE HAS STICKY FINGERS,

17:25.140 --> 17:27.108
AND SHE'S KNOCKING OFF
THOSE JOINTS

17:27.140 --> 17:28.778
THAT GIVE YOU, LIKE,
A CASH ADVANCE

17:28.810 --> 17:31.074
ON YOUR PAYCHECK IN CASE
YOU WANT TO GO TO A CLUB.

17:31.110 --> 17:32.805
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S GONNA BE IT FOR TODAY.

17:32.850 --> 17:35.273
WE WILL CONTINUE DISCUSSING
THE PIT MANEUVER

17:35.320 --> 17:36.810
ON FRIDAY.

17:36.850 --> 17:38.613
MR. SPENCER, A WORD?

17:38.650 --> 17:40.857
- I THINK YOU MIGHT BE
IN TROUBLE WITH THE TEACHER.

17:40.890 --> 17:44.053
- I SURE HOPE SO.

17:46.130 --> 17:48.098
- [sighs] YOU SHOULD START
TAKING THIS TRAINING SERIOUSLY.

17:48.130 --> 17:49.449
IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.718
- OH, COME ON, WE BOTH KNOW
THIS IS SOME CRAZY IDEA

17:51.770 --> 17:53.294
DREAMT UP BY MY DAD
AND THE CHIEF.

17:53.340 --> 17:56.867
- IT WASN'T THEIR IDEA, SHAWN.
IT WAS MINE.

17:56.900 --> 17:58.800
I SUGGESTED THE ACADEMY

17:58.840 --> 18:02.139
TO PROTECT YOU
FROM BEING KILLED.

18:02.180 --> 18:03.647
[cell phone rings]

18:03.680 --> 18:04.874
HEY, CARLTON.

18:04.910 --> 18:06.605
- DAVID ARNOLD'S CAR
WAS JUST SPOTTED

18:06.650 --> 18:08.242
NEAR ROSE VALLEY
ON HARRIS STREET.

18:08.280 --> 18:09.679
THIS IS
THE REAL DEAL, O'HARA.

18:09.720 --> 18:11.585
HOP IN A BLACK-AND-WHITE,
AND LET'S BUST THIS GUY.

18:11.620 --> 18:12.814
- I'M ON MY WAY.

18:12.850 --> 18:14.511
I GOT TO GO.
- JULES...

18:14.560 --> 18:16.209
LOOK, I KNOW THAT GUS AND I

18:16.260 --> 18:17.852
ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO GET INVOLVED
IN THIS INVESTIGATION,

18:17.890 --> 18:19.858
BUT I HAVE TO BE HONEST
WITH YOU.

18:19.890 --> 18:22.120
THAT'S GONNA BE
VERY DIFFICULT FOR US.

18:22.160 --> 18:25.220
- YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.692
WHY DON'T YOU COME
WITH ME?

18:26.730 --> 18:28.391
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

18:28.440 --> 18:29.759
- SUNDOWN, WE'RE IN.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.303
- THE GOOSE, SHAWN,
THE BLACK GOOSE.

18:32.340 --> 18:33.898
- THAT HAS NO RING
TO IT AT ALL.

18:33.940 --> 18:37.148
- HARRIS STREET AT ROSE VALLEY,
UNIT 21 EN ROUTE.

18:37.180 --> 18:39.899
SUSPECT NAMED IN CHECK-CASHING
ROBBERIES DETAINED,

18:39.950 --> 18:40.917
AWAITING BACKUP.

18:40.950 --> 18:42.349
LICENSE PLATE CONFIRMED.

18:42.380 --> 18:44.143
REGISTRANT--DAVID ARNOLD.

18:44.190 --> 18:46.750
APPROACH WITH EXTREME CAUTION.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.792
- WHAT?

18:56.930 --> 18:59.569
- WOW.
- SHE LOCKED US IN THE CAR.

18:59.600 --> 19:02.728
- THAT'S WHY SHE LET US COME--
SO SHE COULD KEEP TABS.

19:02.770 --> 19:04.909
THAT CRAFTY
LITTLE DOODLE PUMPKIN.

19:06.870 --> 19:08.576
- ARNOLD, GET OUT
OF THAT VEHICLE

19:08.610 --> 19:10.544
WITH YOUR HANDS
IN THE AIR.

19:10.580 --> 19:13.140
DO IT!

19:23.230 --> 19:25.186
- YOU LOCKED 'EM
IN THE CRUISER, RIGHT?

19:25.230 --> 19:26.424
- YES.
- I APPRECIATE THAT.

19:26.460 --> 19:28.451
- NO PROBLEM.

19:32.730 --> 19:34.766
- WE ARE GONNA BE IN SO MUCH
HOT WATER FOR THIS, SHAWN.

19:34.800 --> 19:35.698
- COME ON, GUS.

19:35.740 --> 19:38.561
THE WATER IS LUKEWARM,
PEE-WARM AT WORST.

19:38.610 --> 19:40.373
BOTTOM LINE IS THIS IS NOT
SITTING RIGHT WITH ME.

19:40.410 --> 19:41.672
- YOU SAY THAT FOR EVERY CASE.

19:41.710 --> 19:43.246
- YEAH, BUT THIS IS LIKE SITTING
ON A CHAIR

19:43.280 --> 19:44.907
COVERED WITH LITTLE
WOODEN JACKS THAT DIG

19:44.950 --> 19:47.248
RIGHT UP INTO THE HUNKERS.
- WHY WOULD YOU CHOOSE THAT?

19:47.280 --> 19:49.248
- LOOK, WE OWE IT TO NICK
TO CATCH THIS CLOWN.

19:49.280 --> 19:50.588
IT'S YOUR FAULT
HE GOT SUSPENDED.

19:50.620 --> 19:52.417
- IT'S OUR FAULT.
- HOW COME WHEN SOMETHING

19:52.450 --> 19:53.883
IS MY FAULT,
IT'S MINE EXCLUSIVELY,

19:53.920 --> 19:55.410
BUT WHEN IT'S YOUR FAULT,
WE SHARE IT EQUALLY?

19:55.460 --> 19:57.758
- BECAUSE I WENT
TO COLLEGE.

19:57.790 --> 19:58.825
- THAT'S NOT COOL.
- WELL...

19:58.860 --> 20:01.658
- THIS IS WEIRD.
- WHAT?

20:01.700 --> 20:03.395
- THE LICENSE PLATE REGISTERED
TO DAVID ARNOLD'S CAR

20:03.430 --> 20:05.398
HAS BEEN IN THE SYSTEM
FOR OVER A YEAR.

20:05.430 --> 20:07.261
- SO?
- SO THAT TINY KOREAN WOMAN

20:07.300 --> 20:08.892
BOUGHT HER CAR THREE WEEKS AGO.

20:08.940 --> 20:10.760
- WHICH MEANS
PRIOR TO THREE WEEKS AGO,

20:10.810 --> 20:12.266
THE POLICE WERE TRACKING
A LICENSE PLATE NUMBER

20:12.310 --> 20:13.629
THAT HADN'T
EVEN BEEN CREATED YET.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.739
- EXACTLY.
THE QUESTION IS,

20:15.780 --> 20:17.338
HOW DID A BOGUS
LICENSE PLATE NUMBER

20:17.380 --> 20:19.473
MAKE IT
ONTO DAVID ARNOLD'S PROFILE?

20:19.510 --> 20:21.410
- WHO ARE YOU CALLING?

20:21.450 --> 20:23.941
- HIS PAROLE OFFICER.

20:25.890 --> 20:28.415
DUDE, IT'S AN IKEA.

20:28.460 --> 20:30.257
UH, QUESTION--

20:30.290 --> 20:32.929
DO YOU GUYS MAKE THOSE
SWEDISH MEATBALLS IN HOUSE,

20:32.960 --> 20:35.554
OR DO YOU HAVE THEM
FLOWN IN FROZEN?

20:35.600 --> 20:37.591
GUS, WHAT IF THEY'RE FROZEN?

20:37.630 --> 20:39.029
THAT'S A HUGE GAME CHANGER
FOR US.

20:39.070 --> 20:40.935
- WE'LL CALL THEM BACK
LATER, SHAWN.

20:40.970 --> 20:41.868
- I THINK ALL THE INFORMATION

20:41.900 --> 20:44.004
IN DAVID ARNOLD'S
POLICE RECORD IS PHONY.

20:44.040 --> 20:46.008
- WHAT ABOUT HIS LISTED
HOME ADDRESS?

20:46.040 --> 20:47.974
[keys clacking]
- [scoffs] IT'S IN BOISE, IDAHO.

20:48.010 --> 20:50.877
[keys clacking]

20:53.080 --> 20:55.640
- THE WILD GOOSE LOUNGE?

20:55.680 --> 20:58.478
- AS IN WILD-GOOSE CHASE.

20:58.520 --> 21:00.750
DAVID ARNOLD
DOESN'T EXIST, GUS.

21:00.790 --> 21:01.882
SOMEBODY MADE HIM UP,

21:01.920 --> 21:03.888
LIKE KELLY LEBROCK
IN WEIRD SCIENCE,

21:03.930 --> 21:07.627
MINUS THAT SWEET, GENEROUS BOSOM
AND THE SEDUCT IVE ACCENT.

21:07.660 --> 21:09.958
- SO THIS FAKE GUY'S A RED
HERRING FOR THE POLICE TO CHASE,

21:10.000 --> 21:11.865
WHILE THE REAL ROBBERS
ARE RIPPING OFF

21:11.900 --> 21:12.992
THESE CHECK-CASHING PLACES.

21:13.030 --> 21:15.635
WHO IS CAPABLE OF HACKING
INTO THE S.B.P.D. DATABASE

21:15.670 --> 21:18.662
AND PLANTING
A FAKE PROFILE?

21:18.710 --> 21:21.873
- HE'S HEADED
TOWARDS THE COLLEGE OVER THERE.

21:21.910 --> 21:23.400
- HE WENT OUT THERE.

21:23.450 --> 21:26.942
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS,
LIKE, FIREMEN?

21:26.980 --> 21:30.416
- THOSE CRAI-TY LITTLE BASTARDS.

21:30.450 --> 21:33.954
WE GOT TO GO BACK TO COLLEGE.

21:41.700 --> 21:44.498
MAVERICK TO CHARLIE, OVER.

21:44.530 --> 21:45.963
- WHAT, SHAWN?

21:46.000 --> 21:48.491
- ACCORDING TO THE DEAN
OF S.B.I.T.,

21:48.540 --> 21:50.861
THE KIDS ARE CHRIS SHEPARD
AND DICKIE HOLLENBRAU.

21:50.910 --> 21:53.037
APPARENTLY, THEY'RE BOTH
COMPUTER WUNDERKINDS.

21:53.070 --> 21:54.469
- AND YOU THINK
THEY'RE THE ONES

21:54.510 --> 21:55.829
THAT HACKED
INTO THE S.B.P.D. DATABASE?

21:55.880 --> 21:57.370
- THAT'S A 10-4, CHARLIE.

21:57.410 --> 21:59.799
THEY DISABLED
LONGSDALE'S SECURITY SYSTEM

21:59.850 --> 22:00.817
MINUTES BEFORE THE HIT.

22:00.850 --> 22:02.818
- OKAY, LISTEN,
DO NOT GO ANY FURTHER WITH THIS,

22:02.850 --> 22:03.782
AND BY ALL MEANS,

22:03.820 --> 22:05.685
DO NOT GO TRACKING THEM DOWN
AT THAT SCHOOL.

22:05.720 --> 22:09.019
- CHUG, CHUG, CHUG, CHUG,
CHUG, CHUG, CHUG!

22:09.060 --> 22:12.086
[cheering]

22:12.130 --> 22:14.792
- COPY THAT.
- YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE.

22:14.830 --> 22:15.922
LOOK, BACKUP IS ON THE WAY.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.860
JUST DON'T DO
WHAT YOU NORMALLY DO.

22:17.900 --> 22:19.697
- DONE.
LET'S DO THIS.

22:19.730 --> 22:20.936
I GO HIGH.
YOU GO LOW.

22:20.970 --> 22:22.528
- I'LL GO HIGH.
YOU GO LOW.

22:22.570 --> 22:24.868
- I ALWAYS GO HIGH.
- WE ONLY DID HIGH-LOW ONCE.

22:24.910 --> 22:27.003
- YEAH, AND I WENT HIGH.
- LET'S MIX IT UP. GO LOW.

22:30.750 --> 22:33.514
- AH! OW!

22:36.080 --> 22:37.616
- LOOKS LIKE THEY CLEARED
OUT OF HERE.

22:37.650 --> 22:38.787
- YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT, GUS.

22:38.820 --> 22:40.048
YOU WENT HIGH.
- I KNOW.

22:49.860 --> 22:51.589
[beep]
-DUDEm

22:51.630 --> 22:53.166
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

22:53.200 --> 22:54.838
WE HAVE, LIKE, SIX MINUTES
BEFORE LASSIE GETS HERE.

22:54.870 --> 22:57.168
- WE WILL BE LONG DUCK GONE
BY THEN, GUS.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.804
JUST SNOOP IT UP.

23:11.520 --> 23:14.614
HEY, YOU THINK IT'S WEIRD
THAT TH ESE TWO

23:14.660 --> 23:17.686
HAVE OVER 10,000 LOYAL-SHOPPER
POINTS FROM BAZO'S GROCERY,

23:17.730 --> 23:19.482
EVEN THOUGH IT'S, LIKE,
20 MILES AWAY?

23:19.530 --> 23:23.091
- YEAH, AND THE TUNA SALAD
IS REALLY MAYONNAISE-Y.

23:23.130 --> 23:25.018
CHECK THIS OUT.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.697
- WHAT DO YOU GOT?

23:26.730 --> 23:28.994
- OOH.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.565
- THIS IS THEIR ROOM
RIGHT HERE.

23:31.610 --> 23:33.976
- CLOSET. CLOSET.

23:40.620 --> 23:44.909
[popcorn popping]

23:44.950 --> 23:47.510
[whispering]
GUS...

23:47.560 --> 23:50.927
THE SMOKING GUN.

23:50.960 --> 23:52.848
LET'S GO, NICK!

23:55.960 --> 23:58.793
- OH, WE JUST MISSED
THESE PUPPIES.

23:58.830 --> 24:01.060
- TWO-BIT GANGSTER
DEVRY LONGSDALE.

24:01.100 --> 24:02.192
- THAT'S DEVRY.

24:02.240 --> 24:05.698
HE OWNS THE CHECK-CASHING PLACES
THAT GOT KNOCKED OFF.

24:05.740 --> 24:09.608
- WE'RE GONNA FIND THESE GUYS,
GET MY MONEY,

24:09.640 --> 24:13.918
AND SHOOT 'EM IN THEY FACES
LIKE MARVIN IN PULP FICTION...

24:13.950 --> 24:16.441
EXCEPT WE GONNA DO IT
ON PURPOSE.

24:26.190 --> 24:27.999
- HOW DID THESE TWO IDIOTS

24:28.030 --> 24:30.191
FIGURE OUT THAT IT WAS CHRIS
AND DICKIE WHO WERE ROBBING 'EM?

24:30.230 --> 24:32.164
- I DON'T KNOW, GUS,
BUT WE BETTER FIND THOSE KIDS

24:32.200 --> 24:34.737
BEFORE DEVRY DOES.

24:43.880 --> 24:45.541
- LOOK, I KNOW YOU GUYS

24:45.580 --> 24:47.810
SEARCHED THEIR DORM,
BECAUSE IT REEKED OF POPCORN.

24:47.850 --> 24:48.976
[both scoff]

24:49.020 --> 24:50.146
- THAT'S ALL
YOU'RE GOING OFF OF?

24:50.180 --> 24:51.511
- PLUS, YOU LEI-T THIS.

24:51.550 --> 24:53.552
- OOH.
- YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

24:53.590 --> 24:54.557
- AND ONE OTHER THING--

24:54.590 --> 24:56.057
I HAVE ARRANGED
FOR SOMEONE ELSE

24:56.090 --> 24:57.751
TO TAKE YOU
ON YOUR RIDE-ALONG TODAY.

24:57.790 --> 24:59.826
- WHAT? JULES, YOU CAN'T BAIL
ON US NOW.

24:59.860 --> 25:01.794
- YEAH, WE'RE THIS CLOSE
TO CATCHING CHRIS AND DICKIE.

25:01.830 --> 25:03.798
- I JUST DON'T WANT TO GET
IMPLICATED IN ANY OF THIS.

25:03.830 --> 25:05.263
- WELL, THAT IS DISAPPOINTING.

25:05.300 --> 25:07.598
- OKAY, FINE, THEN WHO'D YOU GET
TO REPLACE YOU?

25:07.640 --> 25:08.959
- YOU GUYS READY TO GO?

25:09.000 --> 25:10.831
- YOU ROCK MY WORLD.

25:12.140 --> 25:14.802
AFTER YOU, BUZZ.

25:20.010 --> 25:23.173
- SO I THOUGHT
WE'D, UH, CRUISE ACROSS TOWN

25:23.220 --> 25:25.279
AND, UH, FOLLOW UP
ON SOME REPORTED VANDALISM.

25:25.320 --> 25:27.550
- SWEET.
SOUNDS GOOD, BUZZ.

25:27.590 --> 25:30.252
YOU MIND IF, UH, WE STOP OFF
AT BAZO'S GROCERY FIRST?

25:30.290 --> 25:31.882
- UH, NO.
NO CAN DO.

25:31.930 --> 25:34.091
I WAS GIVEN STRICT ORDERS
NOT TO STOP FOR ANYTHING ELSE

25:34.130 --> 25:35.791
BUT AN EMERGENCY.

25:35.830 --> 25:38.890
- ALL RIGHT, BUT, UH, IF GUS
HERE DOESN'T GET SOME SUGAR

25:38.930 --> 25:41.763
INTO HIS SYSTEM ASAP,
HIS FOOT'S GONNA FALL OFF.

25:41.800 --> 25:43.836
SEE, HE'S GOT DIABETES,

25:43.870 --> 25:46.065
TYPE "A" AND SIMPLEX 2.

25:46.110 --> 25:47.338
- AW, JEEZ.

25:47.370 --> 25:48.837
MY GRANDMOTHER HAD THAT.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.769
A-ARE YOU SURE
IT CAN'T WAIT TILL LATER?

25:51.810 --> 25:53.300
- OH, NO, IT'S FINE.
IT'S FINE...

25:53.350 --> 25:54.715
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T MIND

25:54.750 --> 25:56.877
HAVING MY FOOT POP OFF
IN YOUR BACKSEAT.

25:56.920 --> 25:58.046
- NO WAY,
NOT ON MY WATCH.

25:58.090 --> 25:59.842
HANG TIGHT, BOYS.
- THANKS, BUZZ.

25:59.890 --> 26:01.881
[siren wails]

26:01.920 --> 26:04.889
IT'S LIKE TAKING CANDY
FROM AN ENORMOUS BABY.

26:04.930 --> 26:05.885
- RIGHT.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.897
- I'LL STAY WITH THE CAR.
GET ME A COUPLE OF GLAZED.

26:18.240 --> 26:21.129
- WELL, IT LOOKS
LIKE THE GROCERY BUSINESS

26:21.180 --> 26:22.829
HAS BEEN GOOD
TO MR. BAZO.

26:26.910 --> 26:28.172
- I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S THESE UNIFORMS,

26:28.220 --> 26:29.869
BUT I'VE NEVER CRAVED
DOUGHNUTS MORE.

26:29.920 --> 26:31.342
- WE'RE GONNA NEED
ANOTHER BASKET.

26:31.390 --> 26:32.880
- I HEAR THAT.
- THEY HAVE MUFFINS

26:32.920 --> 26:34.979
AND CROISSANTS
ON THIS BOTTOM SHELF.

26:43.260 --> 26:45.262
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

27:09.160 --> 27:10.957
- THAT'S WHERE
ALL THE MONEY'S COMING FROM.

27:10.990 --> 27:12.389
BAZO'S A BOOKIE.

27:12.430 --> 27:16.855
- AND A HEAVILY ARMED ONE.

27:16.900 --> 27:19.198
- MAY I HELP YOU?

27:19.230 --> 27:21.892
- IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE.

27:21.940 --> 27:23.828
I'M OFFICER SHAWN SPENCER,

27:23.870 --> 27:25.406
AND THIS IS MY PARTNER,
MISSION FIGZ.

27:25.440 --> 27:27.101
WE'RE HERE TO ASK
THE TOUGH QUESTIONS.

27:27.140 --> 27:28.971
FOR STARTERS,
WHO ARE YOU?

27:29.010 --> 27:31.774
- LESTER BAZO,
AND THAT WASN'T VERY TOUGH.

27:31.810 --> 27:32.879
- I LIKE TO EASE MY WAY IN.

27:32.910 --> 27:34.719
WHAT'S THE CAPITAL
OF LIECHTENSTEIN?

27:34.750 --> 27:35.842
- SHAWN.

27:35.880 --> 27:37.939
WE'RE LOOKING FOR CHRIS SHEPARD
AND DICKIE HOLLENBRAU.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.742
I BELIEVE THEY FREQUENTED
THIS ESTABLISHMENT.

27:39.790 --> 27:41.087
- DO I LOOK
LIKE THEIR MOTHERS?

27:41.120 --> 27:42.815
- HARD TO KNOW.
WE HAVEN'T SEEN PHOTOS.

27:42.860 --> 27:44.282
- I DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER
ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS,

27:44.330 --> 27:45.285
SEEING AS YOU'RE JUST CADETS.

27:45.330 --> 27:48.891
- [laughs]
GUILTY AS CHARGED.

27:48.930 --> 27:51.069
BESIDES, WE'RE NOT HERE
TO BUST YOU, MAN.

27:51.100 --> 27:53.227
FIGZ AND I HAVE NO PROBLEMS
WITH GAMBLING.

27:53.270 --> 27:54.737
MATTER OF FACT,
WE'VE BEEN KNOWN

27:54.770 --> 27:55.998
TO LAY DOWN
A FEW WAGERS OURSELVES.

27:56.040 --> 27:58.736
THE RACING HOT DOGS
ON THE JUMBOTRONS

27:58.770 --> 27:59.964
AT BALL GAMES.

28:00.010 --> 28:01.705
- ALWAYS BET ON RELISH.

28:01.740 --> 28:04.903
- THE TRUTH IS, CHRIS AND DICKIE
ARE FRIENDS OF OURS.

28:04.950 --> 28:06.906
WELL, I'M TIGHT WITH CHRIS,

28:06.950 --> 28:08.815
AND FIGZ LOVES DICKIE.
- WHAT?

28:10.120 --> 28:12.042
- WE'RE WORRIED THEY MIGHT HAVE
GAMBLING PROBLEMS.

28:12.090 --> 28:15.253
- YOU THINK?
THEY WERE INTO ME FOR $250K.

28:15.290 --> 28:17.155
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN THEY WERE?

28:17.190 --> 28:19.852
- THOSE PINHEADS PAID ME OFF
IN FULL LAST NIGHT.

28:19.890 --> 28:21.755
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY CAME UP
WITH THE MONEY,

28:21.800 --> 28:23.028
NOR DO I CARE.

28:23.060 --> 28:24.368
- FANTASTIC.

28:24.400 --> 28:25.958
ONE LAST QUESTION--

28:26.000 --> 28:28.730
IS THIS THE ONLY
DOUGHNUT STATION IN THE STORE?

28:28.770 --> 28:31.409
- GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

28:35.410 --> 28:37.901
- SO CHRIS AND DICKIE
GET IN OVER THEIR HEADS

28:37.950 --> 28:39.008
WITH THIS GOON,

28:39.050 --> 28:41.348
SO THEY KNOCK OFF DEVRY,
GRAB THE CASH

28:41.380 --> 28:42.608
THEY NEED TO PAY HIM BACK.

28:42.650 --> 28:44.982
- WHICH MAY BE THE DUMBEST PLAN
TWO GENIUSES EVER CAME UP WITH.

28:45.020 --> 28:47.147
- [exhales sharply]
- OH, HEY, BUMMER, GUYS.

28:47.190 --> 28:48.885
WE GOT TO CUT
THE RIDE-ALONG SHORT.

28:48.920 --> 28:50.922
LASSITER CALLED
WHILE YOU GUYS WERE IN BAZO'S,

28:50.960 --> 28:52.882
AND THEY GOT A REPORTED SIGHTING
OF THE CHECK-CASHING SUSPECT S

28:52.930 --> 28:53.954
IN, UH, MISSION CANYON.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.766
SO I GOT TO GO PATROL THE AREA
WITHOUT YOU GUYS.

28:57.800 --> 28:59.927
I'LL DROP YOU OFF AT THE STATION
SO YOU CAN GET YOUR CAR.

28:59.970 --> 29:01.892
- THANKS, BUZZ.
- NO PROBLEM.

29:01.940 --> 29:04.329
- MISSION CANYON, THAT'S
A PRETTY SMALL AREA, ISN'T IT?

29:04.370 --> 29:06.861
- YEAH, IT'S THREE SQUARE MILES
AT MOST. WHY?

29:06.910 --> 29:08.832
- I THINK I KNOW
HOW WE CAN TRACK 'EM DOWN.

29:13.180 --> 29:14.511
- NICK!
- YO, NICK!

29:14.550 --> 29:15.949
UP AND AT 'EM, MAN.

29:15.980 --> 29:18.210
DUTY CALLS.
- NICK!

29:18.250 --> 29:20.241
- GO AWAY.

29:21.960 --> 29:23.382
- DUDE, I WAS KIDDING.

29:23.420 --> 29:25.229
WHAT, DID YOU SLEEP HERE
LAST NIGHT?

29:25.260 --> 29:27.820
- MAYBE.

29:29.100 --> 29:32.558
- LOOK, WE CAN CATCH THE GUYS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE ROBBERIES.

29:32.600 --> 29:35.296
- GOOD. YOU GUYS GO.
I'LL JUST SCREW IT UP.

29:35.340 --> 29:36.864
- I CANNOT BELIEVE
WHAT I AM HEARING.

29:36.900 --> 29:38.208
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THE NICK CONFORTH WE KNOW

29:38.240 --> 29:39.832
WOULD BE DOINNCCJ' RIGHT NOW?

29:39.870 --> 29:42.907
- WELL, NEITHER DO WE,
REALLY,

29:42.940 --> 29:46.000
BECAUSE OUR WHOLE RELATIONSHIP
WITH YOU ONLY SPANS ABOUT A DAY.

29:46.050 --> 29:49.213
BUT, COME ON, DON'T YOU TEACH
YOUR CADETS TO--TO TOUGH IT OUT

29:49.250 --> 29:51.138
WHEN THE CHIPS ARE DOWN?
- I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.

29:51.190 --> 29:53.408
- THEN YOU NEED TO PRACTICE
WHAT YOU PREACH.

29:53.450 --> 29:55.486
NOW, YOU GET DRESSED
AND HELP US BUST THESE GUYS.

29:55.520 --> 29:58.227
- WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?
- NOTHING.

29:58.260 --> 29:59.818
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

29:59.860 --> 30:01.555
I LITERALLY HAVE NOTHING LEI-T.

30:01.600 --> 30:02.453
- THAT'S THE SPIRIT.

30:02.500 --> 30:04.127
- ALL RIGHT,
WHAT DO YOU NEED ME TO DO?

30:04.170 --> 30:05.819
- GRAB WALTER MATTHAU.

30:05.870 --> 30:07.599
- FENWAY.

30:07.630 --> 30:10.360
- THERE HE IS.
- MATTHAU--MATTHAU'S COMING.

30:15.440 --> 30:18.238
- A LITTLE FIELDWORK
IS EXACTLY WHAT FENWAY NEEDED

30:18.280 --> 30:20.077
TO HELP GET
HIS SELF-ESTEEM BACK.

30:20.110 --> 30:22.340
- WORST IDEA EVER.

30:22.380 --> 30:23.574
- HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

30:23.620 --> 30:25.349
HE--HE'S ONTO SOMETHING.
- [barks]

30:25.390 --> 30:28.848
- THE SUSPECT MAY BE
IN THAT HOUSE.

30:28.890 --> 30:30.118
OR THERE'S A SQUIRREL.
- YES!

30:30.160 --> 30:32.048
BEST IDEA EVER.

30:32.090 --> 30:33.853
LET'S DO THIS.
- HOLD ON.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.128
HOLD ON. WE GOT TO CALL
FOR BACKUP FIRST.

30:35.160 --> 30:37.025
- REALLY?
WE'RE OFF-DUTY,

30:37.060 --> 30:38.322
AND YOU'VE BEEN SUSPENDED.
- I-I DON'T CARE.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.292
WE'RE DOING THIS THE RIGHT WAY,
END OF STORY.

30:40.330 --> 30:41.592
SO CALL IT IN, OR I WILL.

30:41.640 --> 30:42.664
- [sighs]
I NEED SOMEBODY'S THING.

30:42.700 --> 30:45.339
WHAT? LOOKING AT ME
LIKE THAT IS NOT GONNA MAKE

30:45.370 --> 30:47.065
MY WALKIE COME BACK, GUS.

30:47.110 --> 30:50.432
- THIS IS CAR NUMBER
B-LOO-BERRY.

30:50.480 --> 30:53.574
WE HAVE SUSPECT S SHEPARD
AND HOLLENBRAU IN OUR SIGHTS.

30:53.610 --> 30:57.546
1408 AIRFLIGHT,
REQUESTING BACKUP.

30:57.580 --> 30:59.582
ROGER, OVER,

30:59.620 --> 31:02.157
RINSE, REPEAT.

31:02.190 --> 31:03.384
- SPENCER, I KNOW
THAT'S YOU.

31:03.420 --> 31:05.479
STAY WHERE YOU ARE.
I'M 20 MINUTES OUT.

31:05.530 --> 31:08.090
DON'T YOU DARE BLOW THIS.

31:09.530 --> 31:12.658
[glass breaking, man shouts]

31:12.700 --> 31:16.067
[blows landing]

31:16.100 --> 31:17.863
- THAT'S WHAT YOU GET
FOR FOLLOWING ORDERS.

31:24.980 --> 31:26.504
- STAY PUT.

31:28.080 --> 31:30.412
[Dickie groans]

31:30.450 --> 31:33.044
[tires squealing]

31:33.090 --> 31:35.581
- AH, DICKIE,
WHAT HAPPENED?

31:35.620 --> 31:38.088
- SOME GUY THAT LOOKS
LIKE A FABULOUS EMMITT SMITH

31:38.130 --> 31:40.451
JUST KIDNAPPED MY FRIEND.

31:40.490 --> 31:43.050
- DEVRY.
- HE SAYS HE'S GONNA KILL CHRIS

31:43.100 --> 31:44.965
IN 24 HOURS
IF WE DON'T GIVE HIM BACK

31:45.000 --> 31:46.968
THE $250,000
THAT WE STOLE FROM HIM.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.093
- SERIOUSLY, HOW DOES DEVRY
KEEP SHOWING UP AT PLACES

31:49.140 --> 31:50.459
MOMENTS Al-TER WE DO?

31:50.500 --> 31:52.058
- UH-OH.

31:52.110 --> 31:54.078
I THINK I KNOW
WHO HAS MY WALKIE.

31:58.010 --> 32:01.275
[indistinct radio chatter]

32:06.490 --> 32:09.084
- YOU TOLD DEVRY
WHERE WE WERE?

32:09.120 --> 32:11.088
- INADVERTENTLY, OKAY?

32:11.130 --> 32:12.483
HE HAS MY WALKIE.

32:12.530 --> 32:14.418
- BECAUSE YOU LEI-T IT
AT DEVRY'S CHECK-CASHING PLACE.

32:14.460 --> 32:16.428
- GUS, IT IS DIFFICULT
TO HOOF IT AROUND

32:16.460 --> 32:18.121
WITH A BELT THAT'S GOT
ALL THIS BUSINESS ON IT.

32:18.170 --> 32:19.660
- WHAT DID I TELL YOU

32:19.700 --> 32:21.964
ABOUT KEEPING YOUR POLICE
POSSESSIONS CLOSE TO YOU?

32:22.000 --> 32:24.309
- NICK, YOU'RE GONNA BLOW
A TOP, MAN.

32:24.340 --> 32:26.968
WHAT HAVE I LOST, HONESTLY?

32:27.010 --> 32:29.604
A-A MEASLY RADIO
AND THOSE BIG, PINK CUFFS

32:29.640 --> 32:31.369
THAT LOOK LIKE TRASH TIES.

32:31.410 --> 32:33.275
- DICKIE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

32:33.310 --> 32:35.278
- I'M SORRY, OKAY?
I REALLY AM,

32:35.320 --> 32:38.244
BUT I CANNOT GET TAKEN IN
RIGHT NOW.

32:38.290 --> 32:41.054
THEY WILL KILL CHRIS.
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

32:41.090 --> 32:43.558
I GOT TO GO SAVE HIM.

32:43.590 --> 32:45.353
DON'T FOLLOW ME.

32:45.390 --> 32:48.427
- DICKIE!
- NICE, SHAWN.

32:48.460 --> 32:51.964
- OKAY, THIS IS NOT GREAT
FOR US.

32:53.300 --> 32:56.337
- WOW.
I AM SPEECHLESS.

32:56.370 --> 32:58.634
- ME TOO, CHIEF.

32:58.670 --> 33:01.173
- YOU KNOW, NICK, I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT'S GOING ON

33:01.210 --> 33:02.575
INSIDE THAT HEAD OF YOURS,

33:02.610 --> 33:05.078
BUT I'VE GOT NO CHOICE
BUT TO EXTEND YOUR SUSPENSION

33:05.110 --> 33:07.203
FOR ANOTgIIE-IR MONTH.

33:07.250 --> 33:11.311
- AND YOU--
OKAY, WHERE IS MR. GUSTER?

33:11.350 --> 33:12.749
- UH, CHIEF, I'M--I'M AFRAID

33:12.790 --> 33:14.417
THAT WHAT WE, UH,
MAY BE DEALING WITH

33:14.460 --> 33:17.679
IS AN I.B.S. SITUATION.

33:17.720 --> 33:19.381
DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE SEEN
THE COMMERCIALS.

33:19.430 --> 33:20.727
- I'VE SEEN THE COMMERCIALS.

33:20.760 --> 33:22.421
- WELL, THEN YOU KNOW
IT CAN BE SPOTTY.

33:22.460 --> 33:24.098
- OH, GOD, PLEASE,
JUST STOP TALKING.

33:24.130 --> 33:26.189
OH, I HAVE RECEIVED

33:26.230 --> 33:29.267
A LOT OF ADVICE
ON HOW TO DISCIPLINE YOU GUYS,

33:29.300 --> 33:31.200
RANGING FROM
YOUR FATHER'S SUGGESTION

33:31.240 --> 33:33.731
THAT WE MERELY EXTEND
YOUR POLICE TRAINING

33:33.770 --> 33:35.772
TO HAVING YOU PICK UP GARBAGE
ON THE BEACH

33:35.810 --> 33:36.708
WEARING ORANGE JUMPSUITS.

33:39.610 --> 33:40.679
- WELL, I DON'T.

33:40.710 --> 33:42.769
ENROLLING YOU GUYS
IN THE ACADEMY

33:42.820 --> 33:46.210
WAS A GOOD IDEA
GONE HORRIBLY, HORRIBLY AWRY.

33:46.250 --> 33:48.389
AT LEAST WHEN YOU SCREWED UP
AS DETECT IVES,

33:48.420 --> 33:49.819
YOU'D SOMEHOW END UP
CATCHING THE BAD GUYS.

33:49.860 --> 33:53.580
- SOME PEOPLE JUST AREN'T
CUT OUT FOR POLICE WORK.

33:53.630 --> 33:55.757
- WITH THAT SAID,
MR. SPENCER,

33:55.800 --> 33:57.722
YOU AND MR. GUSTER

33:57.760 --> 33:59.762
ARE HERBY REINSTATED
AS CONSULTANTS,

33:59.800 --> 34:01.290
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.

34:01.340 --> 34:02.568
- SORRY?
- [laughs]

34:02.600 --> 34:05.433
THAT IS A-A CLEVER,
WELL-TIMED QUIP, CHIEF.

34:05.470 --> 34:07.609
- IT'S NOT A QUIP, DETECTIVE.

34:07.640 --> 34:09.608
- YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

34:09.640 --> 34:11.608
- YEAH, THEY DID SCREW UP AGAIN,
BUT THEY WERE ABLE TO TRACK DOWN

34:11.650 --> 34:13.777
OUR SUSPECTS BEFORE WE DID.
- WE'RE A TEAM.

34:13.810 --> 34:15.539
- AND I'D PREFER
THAT THEY SCREW UP

34:15.580 --> 34:16.774
WHILE NOT WEARING
OUR UNIFORMS.

34:16.820 --> 34:18.287
- WE WON'T LET YOU DOWN, CHIEF.

34:18.320 --> 34:21.619
- [chuckles]
YES, YOU WILL.

34:21.660 --> 34:23.685
NOW HAND OVER
YOUR CADET BADGE.

34:23.720 --> 34:26.154
- GLADLY.

34:26.190 --> 34:29.751
[muttering]

34:29.800 --> 34:32.360
MUST'VE SLUNG IT IN ONE
OF THESE SIDE BABIES HERE,

34:32.400 --> 34:34.129
JUST RIGHT IN HERE,
FOR SAFE...

34:38.810 --> 34:41.062
I-I REALLY DO HAVE
A PROBLEM.

34:43.180 --> 34:45.148
IT'S OVER.

34:45.180 --> 34:46.738
YOU WERE IN THE JOHNNY CAN
THE WHOLE TIME?

34:46.780 --> 34:48.771
- MY BELT
IS STILL INTACT, SHAWN.

34:48.820 --> 34:50.310
IT DOESN'T JUST SLIDE
ON AND OFF.

34:50.350 --> 34:51.783
- HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS--
WE DON'T HAVE TO WEAR

34:51.820 --> 34:53.344
THIS RIDICULOUS GEAR ANYMORE.
WE ARE BACK.

34:53.390 --> 34:55.449
- I THINK I'M GONNA GO HIT A BAR
AND ANOTHER BAR

34:55.490 --> 34:56.457
AND THEN ANOTHER.

34:56.490 --> 34:57.650
- NICK, COME ON, MAN,
YOU GOT TO RALLY IT UP.

34:57.690 --> 35:00.124
DICKIE'S OUT THERE SOMEWHERE
TRYING TO WRANGLE THE MONEY

35:00.160 --> 35:01.593
TO PAY DEVRY BACK--
WE JUST GOT TO FIND HIM.

35:01.630 --> 35:02.654
- NO, I'LL PASS.

35:02.700 --> 35:04.725
BESIDES, WHERE IN THE WORLD
IS HE GONNA COME UP

35:04.770 --> 35:08.365
WITH 250 GRAND
WITHIN THE NEXT SIX HOURS?

35:13.840 --> 35:15.774
- I HAVE A GUESS.

35:22.220 --> 35:24.142
- DO YOU HONESTLY THINK
THAT DICKIE WOULD BE SO DUMB

35:24.190 --> 35:25.714
AS TO ROB
FROM THE CRAZY BOOKIE

35:25.750 --> 35:28.184
HE JUST PAID OFF?
- THE KID'S DESPERATE, GUS.

35:28.220 --> 35:29.209
[gunshot]

35:32.830 --> 35:35.390
[exclamations]
- YES, I THINK HE'S THAT DUMB.

35:35.430 --> 35:36.249
- THAT'S PROPANE, SHAWN.

35:36.300 --> 35:37.892
- WE GOT TO GET IN THERE
AND SAVE DICKIE.

35:37.930 --> 35:39.568
- THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

35:39.600 --> 35:41.488
- COME ON.

35:41.540 --> 35:44.907
[exclamations]

35:46.910 --> 35:48.229
[gunshot]

35:51.810 --> 35:53.903
[gunshots]

35:53.950 --> 35:55.679
- HEY, DICKIE,
WHAT'S THE WORD?

35:55.720 --> 35:57.847
- DAMN, YOU ALMOST
GOT THIS OFF.

35:57.880 --> 35:59.745
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?
[gunshot, glass shatters]

35:59.790 --> 36:01.781
- I SIMPLY CAN'T IMAGINE US
GETTING OURSELF

36:01.820 --> 36:03.811
INTO A WORSE SITUATION.
- YO, DICKIE!

36:03.860 --> 36:06.181
WHERE YOU AT, MAN?

36:06.230 --> 36:08.289
I KNOW YOU IN HERE.

36:09.660 --> 36:11.298
[gun cocks]

36:11.330 --> 36:13.469
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

36:13.500 --> 36:14.797
- WHO AM I?

36:14.840 --> 36:16.535
I'M THAT CAT
YOU BE SEEING IN YOUR DREAMS

36:16.570 --> 36:17.730
AND YOUR NIGHTMARES.

36:17.770 --> 36:19.931
- DEVRY, I GOT YOUR MONEY.
both: SHH.

36:19.970 --> 36:22.803
- ALL RIGHT.
- THAT MONEY BELONGS TO ME.

36:22.840 --> 36:25.445
- REALLY?
I DON'T THINK SO.

36:25.480 --> 36:27.345
- YOU REALIZE THIS IS THE END
OF TRUE ROMANCE.

36:27.380 --> 36:28.745
- THAT WAS A MASSACRE, SHAWN.

36:28.780 --> 36:30.714
EVERYBODY DIED.
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

36:30.750 --> 36:32.286
CHRISTIAN SLATER
AND PATTY ARQUETTE MADE IT OUT.

36:32.320 --> 36:33.810
- AND MICHAEL RAPAPORT.

36:33.850 --> 36:37.286
- THAT'S A GOOD POINT, DICKIE.
I FORGOT ABOUT THAT.

36:37.320 --> 36:39.880
- I KNOW YOU AIN'T GOT
NO SHELLS IN THAT GUN.

36:39.930 --> 36:42.751
[gunshots]

36:42.800 --> 36:45.860
- WE ARE GONNA DIE
AND DIE UGLY, SHAWN.

36:45.900 --> 36:48.368
THEY'RE GONNA TAKE US OUT.

36:48.400 --> 36:50.391
- NOT IF THEY TAKE
EACH OTHER OUT FIRST.

36:52.640 --> 36:54.335
[feedback whines]
A'I'I'ENTION, SHOPPERS.

36:54.380 --> 36:56.735

37:17.900 --> 37:19.891
SQUASH THAT MELON.

37:22.400 --> 37:23.492

37:23.540 --> 37:24.802
ALL THAT'S LEI-T
IS BAZO AND DEVRY.

37:24.840 --> 37:27.866
[gunshots]

37:27.910 --> 37:30.834
I JUST DONE SHOT BAZO

37:30.880 --> 37:32.040
NOW I'M COMING

37:32.080 --> 37:33.877
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE GONNA DO, SHAWN?

37:33.910 --> 37:35.639
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

37:35.680 --> 37:37.944
IT'S TIME
FOR A TRAINED OFFICER OF THE LAW

37:37.980 --> 37:39.413
TO STEP UP AND SAVE THE DAY.

37:39.450 --> 37:41.554

37:41.590 --> 37:42.614
TWO DAYS, SHAWN.
- COVER ME.

37:42.660 --> 37:44.719
- WITH WHAT?
- IMPROVISE.

37:44.760 --> 37:46.751
- THAT'S...

37:46.790 --> 37:48.291
THAT'S MY GUN.

37:55.600 --> 37:56.999
- OH! OH!

37:58.770 --> 38:01.432
- [groans]

38:03.110 --> 38:05.874
[Gus imitating gunfire]

38:08.650 --> 38:10.345
- DUDE, WHAT WAS THAT?

38:10.380 --> 38:11.608
- IT'S ME!

38:11.650 --> 38:13.311
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

38:13.350 --> 38:15.887
YOU'VE ACHIEVED PITCH-PERFECT
AK-47-MOUTH ACTION.

38:15.920 --> 38:17.456
- I KNOW!
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING!

38:17.490 --> 38:19.788
- AIR BUMP.

38:32.840 --> 38:34.000
[gun cocks]

38:34.040 --> 38:37.703
- YOU KNOW DEVRY'S
RIGHT BEHIND YOU, RIGHT?

38:37.740 --> 38:40.971
THAT'S RIGHT.
TURN AROUND.

38:42.980 --> 38:46.518
THINGS YOU NEED TO DO FOR ME
OR YOU DIE--

38:46.550 --> 38:49.519
ONE, DROP YOUR WEAPON.

38:51.160 --> 38:55.358
TWO, GET THAT DICKIE OUT HERE
WITH MY MONEY.

38:57.400 --> 39:01.120
AND THREE...

39:01.170 --> 39:02.990
TELL ME WHERE THE HECK
YOU GOT THEM KICKS,

39:03.040 --> 39:05.759
'CAUSE I'M FEELING THEM
IN A NASTY, SILLY WAY.

39:05.810 --> 39:07.459
- THESE?
- MM-HMM.

39:07.510 --> 39:08.807
- YOU LIKE THESE, HUH?

39:08.840 --> 39:10.376
- BUT SERIOUSLY, THOUGH,

39:10.410 --> 39:12.742
KICK THAT GUN OVER HERE.

39:20.490 --> 39:23.152
I'M GONNA KILL YOU ANYWAY,
I THINK, SO...

39:23.190 --> 39:24.748
- NOT ON MY WATCH.

39:24.790 --> 39:26.087
- HEY!

39:26.130 --> 39:28.724
NICK, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU SHOPPED HERE.

39:28.760 --> 39:29.954
- I DON'T.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.820
TOO MUCH MAYONNAISE
IN THE TUNA SALAD.

39:33.970 --> 39:35.597
- I STILL GOT
A HOSTAGE, FOOL,

39:35.640 --> 39:37.995
WHICH MEANS I STILL HAVE
THE UPPER HAND.

39:38.040 --> 39:41.498
- AND SPEAKING OF HANDS,
YOURS IS SHAKING LIKE CRAZY.

39:44.710 --> 39:46.177
[gunshot]

39:50.550 --> 39:53.815
- YOU ARE UNDER ARREST.

39:53.850 --> 39:56.819
- NICK, YOU'RE AMAZING.
YOU'RE A CRACK SHOT.

39:56.860 --> 39:59.988
- MR. SPENCER,
DO YOU HAVE THIS UNDER CONTROL?

40:00.030 --> 40:02.498
- I BELIEVE I DO.
HOW YOU DOING OVER THERE?

40:02.530 --> 40:04.862
- I-I THINK I'M GONNA BARF.

40:06.470 --> 40:08.859
- AH, THAT'S--
THAT'S UNFORTUNATE.

40:15.510 --> 40:18.570
- WELL, THIS CASE HAS HAD
A LOT OF UPS AND DOWNS,

40:18.610 --> 40:20.202
BUT YOU PULLED IT TOGETHER
IN THE END.

40:20.250 --> 40:22.571
[chuckles]
AND ON A SEPARATE NOTE,

40:22.620 --> 40:24.212
MR. SPENCER
AND MR. GUSTER,

40:24.250 --> 40:27.117
YOU WILL RETURN
THE 11 BAGS OF GROCERIES

40:27.150 --> 40:29.482
THAT YOU PROCURED
WHILE THE CRIME SCENE AT BAZO'S

40:29.520 --> 40:30.612
WAS BEING PROCESSED.

40:30.660 --> 40:31.922
- WELL, CHIEF, WE PLANNED

40:31.960 --> 40:33.222
ON PAYING FOR THOSE GROCERIES,

40:33.260 --> 40:35.899
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY,
MR. BAZO IS DEAD.

40:35.930 --> 40:37.488
- HE ISN'T DEAD.

40:37.530 --> 40:39.896
HE'S IN THE I.C.U.

40:39.930 --> 40:40.999
- OH.

40:41.030 --> 40:42.998
- DID YOU ALREADY PUT
THAT GIANT HAM IN THE OVEN?

40:43.040 --> 40:43.961
- YOU KNOW I DID.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.558
- OFFICER CONFORTH,

40:45.610 --> 40:47.635
IN THE END,
YOU SHOWED GREAT BRAVERY.

40:47.670 --> 40:49.570
BUT YOU MAY VERY WELL BE

40:49.610 --> 40:53.239
THE WORST OFFICER IN THE FIELD
I'VE EVER SEEN.

40:53.280 --> 40:55.009
DETECTIVE LASSITER,
GO AHEAD.

40:55.050 --> 40:58.747
- THE CADETS COMING OUT
OF YOUR CLASSES AT THE ACADEMY

40:58.790 --> 41:01.042
ARE TOP-NOTCH, CONFORTH.

41:01.090 --> 41:02.216
I RESPECT THAT,

41:02.260 --> 41:04.956
NOT VERY MUCH, BUT ENOUGH
TO MAKE IT WORTH MENTIONING.

41:04.990 --> 41:06.127
THAT BEING SAID,

41:06.160 --> 41:07.980
WE ARE WITHDRAWING
YOUR SUSPENSION.

41:08.030 --> 41:10.123
YOU CAN START BACK
AT THE ACADEMY TOMORROW.

41:10.160 --> 41:13.266
- WELL, THANK YOU,
DETECTIVE.

41:13.300 --> 41:15.165
AND I'M GLAD THAT THE CADETS
HAVE A GREAT ROLE MODEL

41:15.200 --> 41:16.667
SUCH AS YOURSELF
TO LOOK UP TO

41:16.700 --> 41:19.032
WHEN THEY'RE
OUT IN THE FIELD, SO...

41:27.850 --> 41:29.511
- FELLAS, I THINK
WE CAN PROBABLY AFFORD

41:29.550 --> 41:31.211
TO NIP THE LOVE FEST
IN THE BUTT.

41:31.250 --> 41:33.081
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
- YEAH.

41:33.120 --> 41:33.939
- I THINK IT'S "BUD," SHAWN.

41:33.990 --> 41:35.981
- WELL, I THINK
"BUTT" MAKES MORE SENSE.

41:36.020 --> 41:37.988
YOU KNOW WHAT, NICK?

41:38.020 --> 41:39.851
YOU CAN BE
MY WINGMAN ANYTIME.

41:39.890 --> 41:41.551
- OUR WINGMAN.
- WINGMAN?

41:41.600 --> 41:42.999
WHAT, LIKE,
A HELPER ON DATES?

41:43.030 --> 41:44.156
- NOPE.
- THAT'S A NEGATIVE.

41:44.200 --> 41:45.929
- GOOD LUCK TO YOU, BUD.
- COME ON.

41:45.970 --> 41:47.028
- PSST.

41:48.700 --> 41:51.066
CHIEF'S GONNA MAKE YOU
RETURN THE GROCERIES, ISN'T SHE?

41:51.100 --> 41:52.101
- YEAH.

41:52.140 --> 41:52.959
- WELL, I GOT SOMETHING

41:53.010 --> 41:56.036
WAY COOLER THAN 23 BOXES
OF CAP'N CRUNCH,

41:56.080 --> 41:57.729
A HONEY-BAKED HAM,
AND SOY MILK.

41:57.780 --> 42:00.101
- SOY MILK?
DAMN IT, GUS.

42:01.210 --> 42:03.747
OH, MY GUCHEN.

42:03.780 --> 42:06.248
THAT IS AN EXACT REPLICA OF
KELLY MCGILLIS' LEATHER JACKET

42:06.290 --> 42:07.587
FROM TOP GUN.

42:07.620 --> 42:09.588
- [whispering]
I CAN WEAR IT TONIGHT.

42:09.620 --> 42:11.850
- HOW ABOUT I WEAR IT TONIGHT?

42:11.890 --> 42:13.050
THAT'S WEIRD.
- [normal voice] YEAH.

42:13.090 --> 42:15.558
- YOU WEAR IT TONIGHT.
- I'LL WEAR IT.

42:15.600 --> 42:18.057
- [inhaling deeply]

42:18.100 --> 42:19.727
SORRY.
