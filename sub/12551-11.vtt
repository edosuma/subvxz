WEBVTT

00:05.705 --> 00:08.508
I'm sorry. I know it's late,
but this is
a really special order.

00:08.575 --> 00:11.845
This woman turns up out of
the blue. Her florist has
let her down big time

00:11.911 --> 00:14.047
and she's got this really
important do tomorrow.

00:14.114 --> 00:16.916
"And money,"
she says, "is no object."

00:16.983 --> 00:19.853
So I tell her, "If you're
asking me to work
Saturday night

00:19.919 --> 00:22.555
"to dig you out
of the fertiliser,
it better not be."

00:22.622 --> 00:25.592
I could come over and help.
Dad's cooking one
of his specials.

00:25.658 --> 00:28.928
-I could bring
some over for you.
<i>-Oh, thank you, darling.</i>

00:28.995 --> 00:32.866
But I think I've got
everything I need. And you
know me, if somebody's here,

00:32.932 --> 00:34.868
I'll be rabbiting
instead of working.

00:34.934 --> 00:39.572
And believe me,
my darling, tonight,
rabbits and flowers do not go.

00:39.639 --> 00:42.409
I'll keep some on a low heat.

00:42.475 --> 00:45.011
<i>There's somebody at the door.</i>
<i>Hope it's not the client.</i>

00:45.078 --> 00:47.380
<i>I'm nowhere near done.</i>
<i>I'll see you later.</i>

00:47.447 --> 00:49.649
Love you. Don't wait up.

00:50.583 --> 00:52.819
She says not to wait up.

00:53.820 --> 00:54.888
Mmm!

00:57.424 --> 01:02.729
Oh, sorry. I haven't quite
finished yet. You're very
welcome to take a seat.

01:04.596 --> 01:07.500
-Cup of tea?
-That won't be necessary.

01:08.768 --> 01:11.070
I think this is as we agreed.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.874
Oh. Oh, yes.

01:17.377 --> 01:20.580
-What an unusual name.
-Wormwood.

01:22.982 --> 01:24.918
Mrs Wormwood.

01:26.352 --> 01:27.120
(ZAPPING)

01:27.887 --> 01:29.889
(SCREAMING)

01:35.862 --> 01:37.030
Sleep well.

01:46.473 --> 01:47.707
(CACKLES)

02:00.954 --> 02:02.088
(WHIMPERING)

02:08.728 --> 02:12.265
The time of man is over!

02:12.332 --> 02:14.400
(GASPS)

02:14.467 --> 02:15.835
Hello, Luke.

02:22.475 --> 02:26.946
-It was a nightmare.
That's all.
-But it seemed so real.

02:27.013 --> 02:30.250
She spoke to me.
She said, "Hello, Luke."

02:30.316 --> 02:33.753
But I didn't name you Luke
until after
the Bane were destroyed,

02:33.820 --> 02:36.856
Mrs Wormwood along with them.
It was just a dream.

02:37.857 --> 02:39.459
But I don't dream.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.428
(SIGHING) Never have.

02:44.230 --> 02:45.832
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

02:51.671 --> 02:55.275
-Rani!
-My mum, she's disappeared!

02:55.341 --> 02:59.245
Thanks for coming over,
but I don't know
what you can do.

02:59.312 --> 03:00.780
What have the police said?

03:00.847 --> 03:02.749
Has anything like this
ever happened before?

03:02.815 --> 03:06.152
Is she on medication?
Did we have a row?

03:06.219 --> 03:11.524
Mum wouldn't
just leave the shop.
She didn't even take her van.

03:11.591 --> 03:14.994
-Why was she there so late?
-She had a rush order.

03:15.061 --> 03:17.063
And there were no signs
of a struggle at the shop?

03:20.867 --> 03:24.003
There were flowers
all over the floor.

03:24.070 --> 03:27.607
I wish I could save you
and your father
all this worry.

03:27.674 --> 03:30.143
All I know is that people do
disappear all the time

03:30.209 --> 03:32.011
and then come back,
safe and sound.

03:32.078 --> 03:33.913
But we know the world isn't
as safe as that.

03:33.980 --> 03:35.648
You mean, you think she's
been taken by aliens?

03:35.715 --> 03:37.784
There's no reason to
suppose anything like that.

03:37.850 --> 03:40.153
What about what happened with
Mr Trueman?
She walked off then.

03:40.219 --> 03:41.988
Rani, there's really
no evidence.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.723
(SIGHS) You could use
Mr Smith, couldn't you?

03:43.790 --> 03:46.225
-He could look for Mum
or something.
-I'll do what I can.

03:46.292 --> 03:48.628
But first,
I'd like to take a look
at the shop.

03:48.695 --> 03:52.332
I got the message.
Gita's disappeared?

03:52.398 --> 03:53.933
Rani must be
going off her head.

03:54.133 --> 03:55.702
Is it aliens?

03:55.768 --> 03:58.504
If there has
been an alien here
in the last 24 hours,

03:58.571 --> 04:03.076
-it will have
left an energy trace.
-(SCANNING)

04:03.142 --> 04:06.212
-Oh, no.
-Aliens?

04:06.279 --> 04:10.149
Yes, but the trace is too weak
to identify the species.

04:12.051 --> 04:13.886
-It's the Bane.
-CLYDE: What?

04:13.953 --> 04:17.023
The shape-shifty
squiddy things
that made you?

04:17.089 --> 04:19.858
-How could you know that?
-Mrs Wormwood.

04:25.632 --> 04:27.700
Mr Smith, I need you!

04:31.471 --> 04:34.674
MR SMITH: <i>Yes, Sarah Jane?</i>
<i>You appear to be</i>
<i>in something of a hurry.</i>

04:34.741 --> 04:37.076
Rani's mother has been
kidnapped by the Bane.

04:37.143 --> 04:39.679
And I think Mrs Wormwood
left this for me to find.

04:39.746 --> 04:42.715
<i>-An intentional clue?</i>
-Or maybe it's a red herring.

04:42.782 --> 04:45.718
<i>The Bane are not usually</i>
<i>the perpetrators of intrigue.</i>

04:45.785 --> 04:50.356
<i>Their purpose in visiting a</i>
<i>planet is rather more</i>
<i>fundamental, to feed.</i>

04:50.423 --> 04:53.926
That's what worries me.
Mrs Wormwood has set
this up to get my attention.

04:53.993 --> 04:56.162
I'm betting there's some sort
of clue on that cheque.

04:56.229 --> 04:58.331
<i>The cheque is for</i>
<i>the Mercian Bank,</i>

04:58.398 --> 05:01.801
<i>but the sort code and account</i>
<i>digits are not what</i>
<i>they purport to be.</i>

05:01.868 --> 05:03.770
So, what are they?

05:03.836 --> 05:07.073
<i>They form a tetric</i>
<i>biaxial numeric code.</i>
<i>Deciphering now.</i>

05:08.307 --> 05:12.245
-CLYDE: It's an address.
-It's an invitation.

05:12.311 --> 05:15.381
RANI: So, what are
we waiting for?
Let's get my mum.

05:15.448 --> 05:17.884
-How long have you been there?
-Long enough.

05:17.950 --> 05:20.319
I'm going alone.
If Mrs Wormwood
has gone to all this trouble,

05:20.386 --> 05:22.288
it won't just be
for my company.

05:22.355 --> 05:24.557
She could be after you,
Luke, and she's not
going to have you.

05:24.624 --> 05:27.160
-I can look after myself.
-All the same,
you're staying here.

05:27.226 --> 05:29.595
-You make sure that he does.
-Yeah, sure.

05:29.662 --> 05:32.865
No, this is my mum.
No way you're
leaving me behind!

05:35.134 --> 05:40.740
All right,
but this is dangerous.
You do exactly as I say.

05:40.807 --> 05:42.909
The Bane are a cephalopod race

05:42.975 --> 05:45.845
who use
shape-shifting technologies
to infiltrate planets.

05:45.912 --> 05:48.581
Mrs Wormwood led
their invasion
plans last time,

05:48.648 --> 05:50.850
but she and the other Bane
serve the Bane Mother.

05:57.824 --> 05:58.858
(SIGHS)

06:00.460 --> 06:03.730
They made this drink,
Bubble Shock!

06:05.798 --> 06:09.569
-Sold it right
across the country.
-I remember that. It was foul.

06:09.635 --> 06:14.674
Then you were one of the 2%
unaffected. You were
the reason they made Luke.

06:14.741 --> 06:17.110
<i>Mrs Wormwood needed</i>
<i>to refine the formula,</i>

06:17.176 --> 06:19.445
<i>so she took samples</i>
<i>from thousands of people</i>

06:19.512 --> 06:21.781
<i>and created the perfect</i>
<i>human being, Luke.</i>

06:23.850 --> 06:26.119
Looks like you're right.
She's expecting us.

06:32.191 --> 06:34.861
SARAH JANE:
Stay close behind me.

06:49.976 --> 06:51.077
RANI: Mum!

06:52.612 --> 06:57.350
Mum! Mum, it's me! It's Rani.

06:57.416 --> 07:01.387
I think she's all right.
It's just some sort
of induced trance.

07:01.454 --> 07:06.392
I thought it would
be better this way.
Fewer witnesses.

07:06.459 --> 07:08.928
Mrs Wormwood.

07:08.995 --> 07:11.130
Still hiding out in
factory units, I see.

07:12.231 --> 07:14.801
Sarah Jane Smith.

07:14.867 --> 07:18.571
Still involving children
in your dangerous games.

07:18.638 --> 07:21.607
-You kidnapped my mum.
-Hello, Rani.

07:21.674 --> 07:25.678
-How do you know my name?
-Oh, I've been watching you.

07:25.745 --> 07:28.648
You're taller than
your predecessor.

07:29.615 --> 07:31.751
How does she like America?

07:31.818 --> 07:34.887
I always said we should have
launched Bubble Shock! there.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.690
More cosmopolitan tastebuds.

07:39.192 --> 07:40.793
What do you want?

07:41.594 --> 07:44.997
I want your help.

07:45.064 --> 07:47.133
I beg your pardon?

07:47.200 --> 07:51.037
-Believe me, I take no
pleasure in this, Miss Smith.
-You're asking for help?

07:51.103 --> 07:53.606
After you kidnapped my mum
and put her in a trance?

07:53.673 --> 07:56.742
You've got
a funny way of saying
"please" on your planet.

07:56.809 --> 08:00.680
I didn't imagine
that simply knocking
on your door was an option.

08:00.746 --> 08:04.317
Oh, how is the Archetype,
by the way?

08:04.383 --> 08:06.953
His name is Luke
and you stay away from him.

08:07.019 --> 08:11.324
Oh, I have no
interest in the boy.
He was merely an experiment.

08:11.390 --> 08:13.926
A failed experiment,
thanks to you.

08:14.126 --> 08:18.598
Well, now he is my son
and I will protect
him with my life!

08:18.664 --> 08:22.969
Then you have no
option but to help me.

08:23.035 --> 08:25.104
Is that some sort of threat?

08:25.171 --> 08:31.010
Your entire
planet is under threat,
Miss Smith. The entire galaxy!

08:31.077 --> 08:34.313
Sarah Jane,
there's something here!

08:34.380 --> 08:38.650
-It's a trap!
-Oh, no!
It's me they're after!

08:38.717 --> 08:42.922
-They've got us trapped!
Who are they?
-I'm warning you!

08:42.989 --> 08:46.592
You are an enemy
of the Bane Kindred.

08:47.860 --> 08:51.230
Surrender or be devoured!

08:51.297 --> 08:54.800
-Bane! They're Bane!
-I never surrender!

10:14.714 --> 10:17.717
I don't understand.
Why are the Bane after you?

10:17.783 --> 10:19.719
My mission on
Earth was a failure.

10:19.785 --> 10:21.887
You killed the Bane Mother,
but I bore the blame,

10:21.954 --> 10:23.723
for which I was cast out
from the Bane Kindred.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.225
-And that's why they're
hunting you?
-No. I am hunted

10:26.292 --> 10:29.095
because I want to stop them
taking over the galaxy.

10:33.199 --> 10:37.036
-Will Luke be in?
-Never mind Luke,
what about Mum?

10:39.038 --> 10:40.940
-Wakey, wakey.
-(GASPS)

10:43.943 --> 10:47.513
-What's going on?
-Mum! You're all right!

10:47.580 --> 10:51.117
-What am I doing here?
-You went sleepwalking, Gita.

10:51.183 --> 10:53.486
-Come off it!
-Dad's been really worried.

10:53.552 --> 10:55.588
You'd better get her home.

10:57.423 --> 11:01.861
-Haven't you been in my shop?
-No. I despise flowers.

11:08.134 --> 11:09.468
Mum's back!

11:12.671 --> 11:15.875
-Hello, Luke.
-Mum, what's she doing here?

11:15.941 --> 11:18.344
Luke, Mrs Wormwood
wants our help.

11:18.411 --> 11:22.948
That's Mrs Wormwood?
I thought you said she was an
ugly, bug-eyed squid thing.

11:23.015 --> 11:25.551
Children!
They have no respect.

11:33.893 --> 11:35.961
So this is from where
you save the world?

11:36.028 --> 11:39.865
How comfortingly
unsophisticated.

11:39.932 --> 11:42.535
Mr Smith, I need you!

11:50.609 --> 11:53.446
And there's
a computer in the wall.

11:53.512 --> 11:56.048
I had no idea
you could be so entertaining.

11:56.115 --> 12:00.553
MR SMITH:
<i>Good afternoon, Sarah Jane.</i>
<i>I see that we have a visitor.</i>

12:00.619 --> 12:02.721
Mrs Wormwood is Bane.

12:02.788 --> 12:06.292
<i>So my bio-analysis tells me.</i>

12:06.358 --> 12:10.329
How much make-up does it take
before you get out
in the morning? Ugh!

12:10.396 --> 12:13.632
<i>-Is it wise to have</i>
<i>Bane in the attic?</i>
-Watch her closely, Mr Smith.

12:13.699 --> 12:17.169
At the first sign of trouble,
you're to put her in
a containment vortex.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.905
-Do you understand?
<i>-Perfectly.</i>

12:19.972 --> 12:23.642
Dad's looking after Mum.
Did I miss anything?

12:23.709 --> 12:25.644
Luke's family
aren't exactly lookers.

12:25.711 --> 12:28.147
-She's not my family.
-No, Clyde. She isn't.

12:28.214 --> 12:29.748
Sorry.

12:29.815 --> 12:32.651
And now it's
about time you told us
exactly what's going on.

12:32.718 --> 12:34.720
Hmm.

12:34.787 --> 12:39.024
The Bane Kindred blamed me
for the failure of
our Earth invasion.

12:39.091 --> 12:42.161
And for the death
of the Bane Mother.

12:42.228 --> 12:44.597
Do you know what Bane do
to their kind who fail them?

12:44.663 --> 12:47.133
-SARAH JANE:
I'm not sure that I want to.
-They eat them.

12:50.302 --> 12:54.440
-Alive.
-But you escaped, obviously.

12:54.507 --> 12:59.278
I made you rather
handsome, didn't I?
For a human.

12:59.345 --> 13:02.882
And there can't be
anyone at your school
to match your intelligence.

13:02.948 --> 13:05.484
Just get to the point.

13:05.551 --> 13:09.855
Have you ever heard the legend
of Horath, of the Dark Empire?

13:11.757 --> 13:13.926
No. Mr Smith?

13:14.126 --> 13:17.229
<i>The Dark Empire was a period</i>
<i>of tyrannical galactic rule</i>

13:17.296 --> 13:21.467
<i>by a mysterious and reportedly</i>
<i>immortal alien</i>
<i>entity called Horath,</i>

13:21.534 --> 13:25.638
<i>who crushed the civilisations</i>
<i>of all but the most</i>
<i>primitive planets.</i>

13:25.704 --> 13:29.475
Your hole-in-the-wall machine
is really very impressive.

13:29.542 --> 13:32.144
Horath was defeated,
but couldn't be killed,

13:32.211 --> 13:35.080
so his body and
his consciousness
were divided

13:35.147 --> 13:38.150
and they were hidden
at opposite
ends of the galaxy.

13:38.217 --> 13:40.819
Are you saying that the Bane
have found Horath?

13:40.886 --> 13:44.190
His consciousness,
in the Kaldeann Cluster.

13:44.256 --> 13:47.092
They have a mercenary agent
bringing it to Earth.

13:47.159 --> 13:51.363
And, don't tell me, this is
where they hid
the other half, right?

13:51.430 --> 13:53.632
Three thousand years ago,

13:53.699 --> 13:56.669
there was nowhere
more primitive than Earth.

13:58.137 --> 14:00.039
Little has changed.

14:00.105 --> 14:03.142
So the Bane get hold
of this thing and they can
take over the galaxy.

14:03.209 --> 14:06.712
And stopping them is your way
of getting your own back?

14:06.779 --> 14:08.280
We Bane have a saying.

14:08.347 --> 14:11.684
"The sweetest delicacy
is the tongue of an enemy

14:11.750 --> 14:14.987
"that has looked at you
and licked their lips."

14:15.054 --> 14:17.756
I am now
officially a vegetarian.

14:17.823 --> 14:19.992
So where is Horath's body?

14:20.059 --> 14:24.863
If I knew, would I shackle
myself with the tedium of
asking you for help?

14:25.831 --> 14:28.567
LUKE: But the Bane know?

14:28.634 --> 14:31.604
-Of course.
-So how do we find Horath?

14:31.670 --> 14:35.274
<i>Sarah Jane, there is a relic.</i>
<i>The Tunguska Scroll</i>

14:35.341 --> 14:38.644
<i>that tells the storey</i>
<i>of Horath and his</i>
<i>final resting place.</i>

14:38.711 --> 14:42.781
-So where is it?
<i>-The Black Archive.</i>

14:42.848 --> 14:45.784
Why does that sound so cool
and so scary at the same time?

14:45.851 --> 14:48.520
The Archive is the repository
of everything on Earth

14:48.587 --> 14:50.556
that shouldn't exist,
but does.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.391
The UNIT vaults.

14:52.458 --> 14:55.828
And that, Miss Smith,
is why I need you.

14:57.663 --> 14:59.598
Mr Smith,
contain Mrs Wormwood.

14:59.665 --> 15:03.102
<i>-Instantly.</i>
-What treachery is this?

15:03.168 --> 15:04.970
Don't worry, you'll be
perfectly safe while I'm gone.

15:05.037 --> 15:08.974
How can you know that?
The Bane have
agents everywhere!

15:10.609 --> 15:13.946
(SCREAMING)

15:14.013 --> 15:17.850
So is this it?
The day Clyde Langer
finally hooks up with UNIT?

15:17.916 --> 15:21.887
Locked and loaded,
ready to fight
the scum of the universe!

15:21.954 --> 15:25.591
Haven't I taught you there
are better ways of dealing
with aliens than guns?

15:25.658 --> 15:27.559
What do you expect?
He's a boy.

15:27.626 --> 15:29.828
UNIT have their uses.
But in my experience,

15:29.895 --> 15:33.132
guns never solved a problem
they didn't first make worse.

15:33.198 --> 15:36.769
-And the UNIT can
be so suspicious.
-They're not the only ones.

15:36.835 --> 15:40.239
-Can we really
trust Mrs Wormwood?
-I don't know.

15:40.306 --> 15:43.442
And if I tell UNIT about Mrs
Wormwood, they could start
asking other questions.

15:43.509 --> 15:45.077
About me?

15:45.144 --> 15:47.246
Questions it would be
difficult to answer

15:47.313 --> 15:49.348
without them
getting more suspicious.

15:49.415 --> 15:53.118
Luke, you have to stay here.
But keep away
from Mrs Wormwood.

15:53.185 --> 15:55.220
Yes. Of course.

15:55.287 --> 15:58.857
And Clyde, stay with him.
Keep an eye on things.

15:58.924 --> 16:01.727
-Please. Keep him safe.
-No problem.

16:06.498 --> 16:09.668
Right. Come on, Rani.
I need to see a friend.

16:09.735 --> 16:11.870
A very old friend.

16:15.207 --> 16:17.710
Brigadier, sir.

16:17.776 --> 16:21.714
-Major Kilburne.
What a surprise.
-Your wife let me in.

16:21.780 --> 16:25.484
-Oh, yes.
What can I do for you?
-I'm here to debrief you, sir.

16:25.551 --> 16:27.086
On your mission in Peru.

16:27.152 --> 16:29.855
On my what?
Good God, man, I'm retired.

16:29.922 --> 16:33.592
I don't do missions
any more. I certainly
don't do debriefings.

16:33.659 --> 16:37.863
I'm sorry, Sir Alistair,
but you do remain
UNIT's special envoy.

16:37.930 --> 16:41.800
Yes, which allows
you to dust me down
once in a while

16:41.867 --> 16:44.770
before sending me off
on some fool's errand to Peru.

16:44.837 --> 16:48.640
I'm sorry,
sir, but the Homeworld
Security Mandate dictates...

16:48.707 --> 16:53.746
Homeworld Security?
That's the trouble
with UNIT these days.

16:53.812 --> 16:57.449
Too many buzzwords,
too many directives.

16:57.516 --> 17:01.987
At least in my day,
we maintained
the benefits of common sense.

17:02.054 --> 17:05.223
With respect, Sir Alistair,
UNIT has had to adapt

17:05.290 --> 17:10.229
to the challenges
of a more hostile universe.

17:10.295 --> 17:15.768
In my day, we took on Daleks,
Cybermen, Autons, Zygons

17:15.834 --> 17:18.436
and all manner
of space-thuggery,

17:18.503 --> 17:21.440
and it doesn't get
more hostile than that!

17:21.507 --> 17:24.609
No, Brigadier, you're
so right. It doesn't.

17:24.675 --> 17:27.679
Sarah Jane Smith.

17:27.746 --> 17:30.315
Hello, Sir Alistair.

17:30.382 --> 17:33.719
-It's been a long time.
-Oh, it has, it has.

17:33.786 --> 17:36.422
Major Kilburne, Miss Smith.

17:36.488 --> 17:39.925
It's an honour to meet you.
I've read most of your files.

17:39.992 --> 17:44.530
Some are still Level One
security restricted.
I'm only Level Two.

17:44.596 --> 17:47.666
My files have
a higher security rating
than I ever did.

17:47.733 --> 17:51.570
-I think we're
finished here, Major.
-Yes, sir.

17:51.637 --> 17:54.473
Good day,
Sir Alistair, Miss Smith.

18:00.279 --> 18:03.849
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.285
But I'm afraid this
isn't a social call.

18:06.351 --> 18:09.121
I would almost be disappointed
if it were.

18:11.890 --> 18:14.326
How can I help you?

18:14.393 --> 18:16.862
I need to break
into the Black Archive.

18:18.730 --> 18:20.632
Oh.

18:20.699 --> 18:25.003
I've met some pretty nasty
characters since I hooked up
with Sarah Jane,

18:25.070 --> 18:26.672
but, as far as I'm concerned,

18:26.738 --> 18:28.607
none of them could hold a
candle to my old man

18:28.674 --> 18:30.943
for what he did
to me and my mum.

18:31.009 --> 18:33.879
But, at the same time,
he was my dad.

18:35.214 --> 18:38.250
Without him,
I wouldn't even be here.

18:38.317 --> 18:41.587
That's what I'm thinking,
about Mrs Wormwood.

18:41.653 --> 18:45.290
-I want to see her.
-Sarah Jane told
you to keep away.

18:45.357 --> 18:48.193
And, I don't know,
it's not like she wanted
a kid, is it?

18:48.260 --> 18:51.330
The Bane wanted to
take over the world
and eat us.

18:51.396 --> 18:55.300
Believe me, that's something
most families don't
want to talk about.

18:55.367 --> 18:56.735
I'm going.

18:59.505 --> 19:00.873
Please.

19:03.375 --> 19:08.947
Luke, I see you
haven't abandoned me.
Thank you.

19:09.014 --> 19:11.950
I want to ask
you some questions.

19:12.017 --> 19:16.688
Of course.
Release me and we can talk.

19:16.755 --> 19:21.860
-I'm not going to release you.
-I won't harm you.
I created you.

19:24.229 --> 19:27.032
It must have been
very difficult for you, Luke.

19:27.099 --> 19:34.907
Being born into this strange
world, knowing so much
and yet, nothing at all.

19:34.973 --> 19:38.143
-I was born running.
-(ALARM BLARING)

19:38.210 --> 19:39.912
Sarah Jane gave me a name.

19:39.978 --> 19:42.548
-I like Luke.
-I like Luke.

19:42.614 --> 19:47.686
-She made me into a person.
-From the raw
material I provided.

19:47.753 --> 19:49.888
How does it feel
to be so special?

19:51.156 --> 19:54.459
It isn't always easy.

19:54.526 --> 19:59.631
Is that why you wanted
to talk? Do you hate me
for giving you life?

19:59.698 --> 20:02.167
I enjoy my life,

20:02.234 --> 20:05.871
but this world is complicated,
however clever you are.

20:07.072 --> 20:11.910
And sometimes you
feel so isolated.

20:11.977 --> 20:15.948
You are quite unique
throughout the
entire universe.

20:16.014 --> 20:19.551
Alone in its darkness,
without blood kin.

20:22.487 --> 20:23.855
Just as I am.

20:35.233 --> 20:37.235
RANI: So, that's the
Black Archive facility.

20:37.302 --> 20:42.140
Yes, and no one's allowed
anywhere near there without
Level One clearance.

20:42.207 --> 20:44.610
But they won't look twice
if you drive up.

20:44.676 --> 20:49.448
All the same, if they were to
catch you in there,
it won't go well.

20:49.514 --> 20:53.719
There's no other way.
I won't risk UNIT taking
an interest in Luke.

20:53.785 --> 20:56.321
As far as men like Major
Kilburne are concerned,
he isn't human.

20:56.388 --> 20:57.589
That means he's a threat.

20:57.656 --> 20:59.791
And the Bane's agent
is already on his way.

20:59.858 --> 21:02.928
We have to get the scroll,
find Horath and stop them
bringing him back to life.

21:03.128 --> 21:05.397
You'd better get in the back
and get down.

21:12.170 --> 21:15.440
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

21:15.507 --> 21:17.542
GUARD: Pass through, sir.

21:23.849 --> 21:28.153
ALISTAIR: We're here.
Stay put while I check
the coast is clear.

21:36.094 --> 21:38.864
Brigadier, what are
you doing here?

21:38.930 --> 21:42.200
Major Kilburne.
This must be my lucky day.

21:42.267 --> 21:44.870
Sir, I'm sorry we got off
on the wrong foot earlier.

21:44.936 --> 21:47.005
I fully understand the debt
the world owes to you

21:47.072 --> 21:49.107
and the men of
UNIT in the past.

21:49.174 --> 21:51.743
That's very
gracious of you, Major.

21:51.810 --> 21:54.146
Perhaps we could go
for dinner some time, sir?

21:54.212 --> 21:58.283
I'd be fascinated to hear
some of your stories
about the old days.

21:58.350 --> 22:01.453
-Yes, of course.
-I look forward to it.

22:07.325 --> 22:09.594
By the way,

22:09.661 --> 22:13.532
you didn't say, sir.
What are you doing
at the Archive?

22:14.933 --> 22:17.302
My memoirs, Major.

22:17.369 --> 22:20.072
Now that
the cat's out of the bag
about aliens,

22:20.138 --> 22:25.077
it seems as good a time as any
to tell a few of those stories

22:25.143 --> 22:26.745
about the old days.

22:26.812 --> 22:30.982
I see. Just don't
give away our secrets,
will you, sir?

I'll keep watch out here.

the authorities have known
about aliens all this time?

So since Roswell,
all they've been
doing is lying to us?

23:15.827 --> 23:17.729
