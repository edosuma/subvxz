I CAN'T DO IT.

01:34.300 --> 01:36.600

YOU'RE WELCOME.

02:01.533 --> 02:02.767
EXCUSE ME.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.267
CAN I HELP YOU ?

02:04.300 --> 02:05.767
COULD YOU PLEASE
TELL ME WHAT TIME

02:05.800 --> 02:07.400
THAT WOMAN'S APPOINTMENT
WAS FOR ?

02:07.433 --> 02:11.300
MISS WINOKER'S, 11:45.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.067
WELL, SHE'S AFTER ME.

02:14.100 --> 02:15.133
SHE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE AFTER ME.

02:15.167 --> 02:16.700
WELL, SHE SIGNED IN
BEFORE YOU, SIR.

02:16.733 --> 02:18.267
I'M 11:30,
SHE'S 11:45.

02:18.300 --> 02:19.433
WHY AREN'T I GOING
AHEAD OF HER ?

02:19.467 --> 02:21.800
SHE WAS HERE FIRST,
SHE SIGNED IN FIRST--

02:21.833 --> 02:23.067
AND MY APPOINTMENT
IS FOR 11:30.

02:23.100 --> 02:26.167
WELL, SIR, IT WAS JUST
A FEW MINUTES BEFORE YOU.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.567
THERE'S NO NEED
TO GET UPSET,

02:27.600 --> 02:29.133
WE HAVE A POLICY
IN THIS OFFICE

02:29.167 --> 02:30.367
THAT YOU ARE SEEN
AS YOU SIGN IN.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.400
THAT'S THE POLICY
OF THE OFFICE.

02:31.433 --> 02:32.500
WHAT IS IT,
LIKE A BAKERY ?

02:32.533 --> 02:34.767
YOU PICK A NUMBER
AND THE FIRST NUMBER GOES ?

02:34.800 --> 02:35.767
IT'S FIRST COME,
FIRST SERVE.

02:35.800 --> 02:37.333
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
HAVE A LITTLE TICKET,

02:37.367 --> 02:38.967
WE CAN ALL
TAKE NUMBERS.

02:39.067 --> 02:40.567
WHY EVEN GIVE OUT
THE APPOINTMENTS ?

02:40.600 --> 02:42.167
SIR, JUST CALM DOWN,
PLEASE.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.900
NO, SERIOUSLY, FOR THIS POLICY,
YOU DON'T NEED APPOINTMENTS.

02:43.933 --> 02:46.333
SIR, THE POLICY OF THE OFFICE IS
YOU ARE SEEN AS YOU COME IN.

02:46.367 --> 02:50.267
THAT WAY WE SEE AS MANY PATIENTS
AS POSSIBLE IN A GIVEN DAY.

02:50.300 --> 02:51.267
THAT MAKES SENSE,
DOESN'T IT ?

02:51.300 --> 02:52.300
NO, IT DOESN'T.

02:52.333 --> 02:53.333
IT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE AT ALL.

02:53.367 --> 02:54.600
I UNDERSTAND.

02:54.633 --> 02:55.900
YOU'RE PROBABLY HAVING
A BAD DAY, YOU'RE IN PAIN,

02:55.933 --> 02:57.900
BUT THAT IS THE POLICY
OF THIS OFFICE.

02:57.933 --> 02:59.067
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
THIS POLICY ?

02:59.100 --> 03:00.900
PLEASE DON'T TALK TO HER,
SHE'S BUSY.

03:03.867 --> 03:04.900
I GET IT.

03:04.933 --> 03:07.333
IT'S NO SWISS PICNIC
FOR ME, EITHER.

03:12.733 --> 03:14.100
( sighing )

03:16.067 --> 03:18.867
DID YOU HEAR THAT ?

03:18.900 --> 03:20.433
UNBELIEVABLE.

03:20.467 --> 03:22.600
THIS IS
THEIR POLICY, OKAY.

03:22.633 --> 03:26.200
FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED,
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

03:26.233 --> 03:28.700
DID YOU HEAR
ANY OF THAT ?

03:29.700 --> 03:31.333
HUH ?

03:31.367 --> 03:32.567
YEAH, NO,
WE HEARD IT.

03:32.600 --> 03:35.400
WE JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S NOT
REALLY NECESSARY TO COMMENT

03:35.433 --> 03:37.633
AT THIS
PARTICULAR TIME.

03:37.667 --> 03:41.067
NO COMMENT UNTIL
THE TIME LIMIT IS UP.

03:45.233 --> 03:47.200
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT TIME
YOUR APPOINTMENT IS FOR,

03:47.233 --> 03:49.700
ANYBODY WHO COMES IN
AHEAD OF YOU GETS YOUR SPOT.

03:49.733 --> 03:51.733
THAT'S HOW
THEY DO IT HERE.

03:51.767 --> 03:53.833
I'M TELLING YOU.

03:53.867 --> 03:54.867
WHAT ?

03:54.900 --> 03:56.700
WHAT DO YOU HAVE
TO SAY, NOTHING ?

03:56.733 --> 03:57.800
CAN'T TALK ?

03:57.833 --> 03:59.067
PEOPLE AT DOCTOR'S
OFFICES CAN'T TALK,

03:59.067 --> 04:00.200
IS THAT A RULE
OR SOMETHING ?

04:00.233 --> 04:03.500
OH, EXCUSE ME.

04:03.533 --> 04:06.233
I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU,
BUT I DID A NICE THING FOR YOU.

04:06.267 --> 04:07.633
I HELD THE ELEVATOR FOR YOU,
SO YOU CAN GET ON FIRST.

04:07.667 --> 04:08.800
RIGHT.

04:08.833 --> 04:10.100
AND THEN I WAS A GENTLEMAN,
I LET YOU OUT.

04:10.133 --> 04:11.433
RIGHT.

04:11.467 --> 04:14.300
AND YOU CAME DOWN THE HALL,
YOU WOULDN'T LET ME GET BY YOU--

04:14.333 --> 04:16.633
I WOULDN'T
LET YOU GET BY ME ?

04:16.667 --> 04:17.900
YOU SIGNED IN
AHEAD OF ME.

04:17.933 --> 04:19.667
I WAS HERE BEFORE YOU,
OF COURSE I SIGNED IN AHEAD.

04:19.700 --> 04:22.467
YEAH, BUT MY APPOINTMENT
WAS FOR 11:30,
YOUR'S FOR 11:45.

04:22.500 --> 04:23.933
YOU KNOW WHAT TIME
MY APPOINTMENT WAS ?

04:23.967 --> 04:26.133
WHY DO YOU EVEN CARE WHAT TIME
MY APPOINTMENT WAS ?

04:26.167 --> 04:28.133
WHAT WERE YOU DOING IN THERE
ANYWAY FOR 40 MINUTES ?

04:28.167 --> 04:29.733
WHAT WAS
GOING ON IN THERE ?

04:29.767 --> 04:30.733
WHAT WERE YOU,
CHATTING ?

04:30.767 --> 04:33.633
TALKING ABOUT OLD TIMES,
WHAT WAS THAT ?

04:33.667 --> 04:35.067
HUH ?

04:35.100 --> 04:36.133
YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

04:36.167 --> 04:38.167
YOU'RE IN A DOCTOR'S OFFICE,
DON'T CHIT-CHAT.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.967
DON'T ASK HIM HOW HIS DAY WAS,
YOU DON'T CHIT-CHAT.

04:40.067 --> 04:42.233
YOU KNOW, LET HIM
EXAMINE YOU, YOU GO OUT.

04:42.267 --> 04:45.467
MR. DOBB, LURRY DOBB.

04:45.500 --> 04:46.933
THAT'S LARRY DAVID.

04:46.967 --> 04:49.100
MR. DAVID, THE DOCTOR
WILL SEE YOU NOW.

04:49.133 --> 04:52.533
OH, WOW,
THAT'S VERY SPECIAL,
ISN'T IT ?

04:55.100 --> 04:56.067
THANK YOU.

04:56.100 --> 04:57.133
THANK YOU FOR
YOUR PATIENCE.

04:57.167 --> 04:59.267
YES, IT'S BEEN
QUITE A NICE TIME.

04:59.300 --> 05:00.367
RIGHT HERE,
ROOM FOUR.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.467
OH, WHAT'S THIS,
ANOTHER HALF HOUR NOW ?

05:07.067 --> 05:08.200
HEY, LARRY.

05:08.233 --> 05:09.267
HEY, CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION ?

05:09.300 --> 05:10.367
SURE, WHAT'S UP ?

05:10.400 --> 05:11.767
WHAT'S WITH YOUR
WAITING ROOM POLICY ?

05:11.800 --> 05:13.067
I DON'T GET IT AT ALL.

05:13.100 --> 05:14.333
REALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT ?

05:14.367 --> 05:15.467
YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON
WHO HASN'T LIKED IT.

05:15.500 --> 05:16.933
NOBODY'S MENTIONED
THIS TO YOU ?

05:16.967 --> 05:18.067
NO, THEY LOVE IT.

05:18.067 --> 05:19.567
WELL, YOU GOTTA
DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.

05:19.600 --> 05:20.567
I MEAN,
IT'S REALLY--

05:20.600 --> 05:22.300
HEY, I'LL MAKE A NOTE.

05:22.333 --> 05:23.500
I'LL MAKE A NOTE.

05:23.533 --> 05:24.900
I'VE BEEN WAITING
SO LONG,

05:24.933 --> 05:27.133
I'M LATE FOR AN APPOINTMENT
WITH DIANE KEATON.

05:27.167 --> 05:28.133
AND IT'S A VERY
IMPORTANT THING.

05:28.167 --> 05:29.133
DIANE KEATON ?

05:29.167 --> 05:30.133
YEAH.

05:30.167 --> 05:31.300
WHAT IS THAT ABOUT ?

05:31.333 --> 05:33.567
SHE'S VERY INTERESTED
IN DOING MY SCRIPT.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.600
GOOD FOR YOU, LARRY.

05:34.633 --> 05:35.600
HEY, THAT'S EXCITING.

05:35.633 --> 05:36.600

05:36.633 --> 05:37.600

05:41.500 --> 05:43.433
YES, YES.

05:46.633 --> 05:48.967
DID SHE
SAY ANYTHING ?

05:49.067 --> 05:50.067
NO, NO, NO.

05:50.067 --> 05:53.267
SHE READ IT THOUGH,
I SAW HER READING IT.

05:53.300 --> 05:54.400
SHE'S A GOOD LAWYER.

05:54.433 --> 05:55.500
YEAH, GOOD LAWYER.

05:55.533 --> 05:56.633
WELL, WHAT DO YOU

05:58.733 --> 05:59.800

05:59.833 --> 06:01.533
YOU KNOW THE COMEDIAN,
RICHARD LEWIS ?

06:01.567 --> 06:02.533
SURE.

06:02.567 --> 06:04.367
WE HAD A FIGHT
OVER SOME BRACELET

06:04.400 --> 06:05.600
IN FRONT OF
A JEWELRY STORE.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.367
YEAH, HOW DOES

YEAH, IT'S FINE.

06:10.867 --> 06:11.833
WHAT IS THIS ?

06:11.867 --> 06:12.833
IT'S MY WIFE
MADE A SPLINT.

06:12.867 --> 06:13.900
YOUR WIFE ?

06:13.933 --> 06:15.500
IT'S A PLASTIC KNIFE.

06:15.533 --> 06:16.933
WERE YOU AT A PICNIC
WHEN YOU HURT YOURSELF ?

06:16.967 --> 06:17.933
HA.

06:17.967 --> 06:18.933
NOTHING HURTS,
YOU'RE ALL SET.

06:18.967 --> 06:20.133
LOSE THE SPLINT

06:20.167 --> 06:22.300
UNLESS YOU SAVE THE FORK
AND YOU GOT YOURSELF A PAIR.

06:22.333 --> 06:23.500
ALRIGHT, LARRY, SEE YA.

06:23.533 --> 06:24.933

UH-OH.

06:44.500 --> 06:46.067

06:46.067 --> 06:47.767
I DON'T THINK
I HAVE ANY MONEY.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.133
DID YOU LOOK IN
YOUR LITTLE CHANGE THING ?

06:49.167 --> 06:52.267
I DON'T HAVE IT,
IT WOULD BE IN MY WALLET.

06:52.300 --> 06:54.367
MY DRAWER NEEDS $3.00,
I'M SORRY, YOU KNOW.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.133

I NEED THE MONEY.

07:01.467 --> 07:02.533
CAN YOU LAY IT
OUT FOR ME ?

07:02.567 --> 07:03.633
YOU DON'T HAVE $3.00 ?

07:03.667 --> 07:05.667
I DON'T HAVE IT,
I'M OUT OF CASH.

07:05.700 --> 07:06.700

07:47.233 --> 07:48.467
HEY.

07:50.667 --> 07:52.600

07:52.633 --> 07:53.867
OH.

07:55.733 --> 07:57.567
I KEPT HER HERE
AS LONG AS I COULD.

07:57.600 --> 07:58.833
WHAT HAPPENED ?

07:58.867 --> 08:00.267
I GOT HELD UP AT
A DOCTOR'S OFFICE.

08:00.300 --> 08:01.300
ARE YOU OKAY ?

08:01.333 --> 08:02.433
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING,

08:02.467 --> 08:05.067
MY DAYS OF
ELEVATOR ETIQUETTE
ARE OVER.

08:05.067 --> 08:06.200
OVER.

08:06.233 --> 08:07.367
I'M NOT HOLDING
DOORS ANYMORE,

08:07.400 --> 08:09.733
NOT LETTING WOMEN OUT
FIRST ANYMORE, THAT'S DONE.

08:09.767 --> 08:10.933
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

08:10.967 --> 08:12.767
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
CAUSED ME TO BE LATE

08:12.800 --> 08:14.833
'CAUSE I LET A WOMAN OUT FIRST
AND SHE GOT IN THE OFFICE

08:14.867 --> 08:16.433
AND TOOK 45 MINUTES
AND, UH...

08:16.467 --> 08:19.367
NO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO TELL YOU, SHE SAID,

08:19.400 --> 08:20.767
"I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN WORK WITH
SOMEBODY WHO'S LATE LIKE THIS."

08:20.800 --> 08:21.833
SHE SAID THAT ?

08:21.867 --> 08:23.200
SHE'S NOT GONNA DO IT.

08:23.233 --> 08:25.433
THAT'S ALL, I MEAN,
I DON'T MEAN TO...

08:25.467 --> 08:26.467
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

08:26.500 --> 08:27.700
I'M TESTING MY FINGER.

08:27.733 --> 08:30.067
ALRIGHT.

08:30.100 --> 08:31.600
WELL, ALL I'M TELLING YOU IS
IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

08:31.633 --> 08:32.800
I CAN'T CALL HER ?

08:32.833 --> 08:34.533
YOU KNOW WHAT ?
I SUGGEST YOU WRITE A NOTE.

08:34.567 --> 08:35.767
I'M WRITING
LIKE TARZAN.

08:35.800 --> 08:37.267
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T.

08:37.300 --> 08:39.933
WELL TRY, IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD,
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING TO YOU.

08:39.967 --> 08:42.400
IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

08:43.500 --> 08:44.833
THIS HER TEA ?

08:44.867 --> 08:46.300
THAT'S HER TEA.

08:46.333 --> 08:49.067
OH, SHE'S SO PERFECT
FOR THIS THING, TOO.

08:49.067 --> 08:50.100
PERFECT.

08:50.133 --> 08:51.767
I KNOW, WELL,
WE'LL TRY, WE'LL TRY.

08:51.800 --> 08:52.767
I'M NOT GONNA GIVE UP.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.067
YOU WANT
SOMETHING TO EAT ?

08:54.100 --> 08:56.600
I'M JUST

I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET OUR NEW
INTERIOR DECORATOR, CARMEN.

09:23.067 --> 09:24.300
HE'S SURPRISED,

09:24.333 --> 09:26.367

RUMBLINGS ABOUT IT--

09:26.400 --> 09:28.333
RELAX, YOU ARE IN
GOOD HANDS, BELIEVE ME.

09:28.367 --> 09:29.367

09:39.667 --> 09:41.700
I'M A VERY
VIVACIOUS MAN.

09:43.233 --> 09:44.900
SHE WANT
THE EARTH TONE, LARRY.

09:44.933 --> 09:46.400
I THINK EARTH TONE

09:46.433 --> 09:49.200
BOO, ON EARTH TONES,
THAT IS SO PASSE.

09:49.233 --> 09:50.400
YOU WANT SOMETHING
TO STIMULATE YOU ?

09:50.433 --> 09:51.467
YES.

09:51.500 --> 09:52.867
I'M A PASTEL MAN.

09:52.900 --> 09:54.533
HE'S TEASING YOU
ALL THE TIME.

09:54.567 --> 09:56.267
TEASING
ALL THE TIME.

09:56.300 --> 09:57.400
I'M BEING SERIOUS.

09:57.433 --> 09:59.100
I DON'T SEE THE BOOK
I NEED HERE.

09:59.133 --> 10:02.400
HEY, HOW WAS YOUR MEETING
WITH DIANE KEATON ?

10:02.433 --> 10:03.567
UH, I WAS LATE.

10:03.600 --> 10:06.167
SHE LEFT.

10:06.200 --> 10:07.333
SO, YOU DIDN'T GET
TO MEET HER AT ALL ?

10:07.367 --> 10:08.433
NO.

10:08.467 --> 10:10.400
OH, THAT'S TOO BAD,
THAT'S MY CLIENT.

10:10.433 --> 10:12.067
DIANE KEATON'S
YOUR CLIENT ?

10:12.100 --> 10:14.633
VERY NICE,
SHE'S VERY NICE.

10:14.667 --> 10:15.633
OH, WOW.

10:15.667 --> 10:16.933
FOR YEARS I KNOW HER.

10:16.967 --> 10:19.467
I THINK THERE'S A MESSAGE
FOR YOU FROM HER, ACTUALLY.

10:19.500 --> 10:20.467
FROM DIANE KEATON ?

10:20.500 --> 10:21.500
YEAH, YEAH,
SHE LEFT A MESSAGE.

10:21.533 --> 10:22.533
YOU'RE KIDDING.

10:22.567 --> 10:23.633
I HAVEN'T
LISTENED TO IT,

10:23.667 --> 10:24.967
BUT I WAS IN THE OTHER ROOM
AND I HEARD IT.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.500
( Diane )
Uh, Larry,
it's Diane Keaton.

10:29.533 --> 10:32.133
I don't know
what happened today.

10:32.167 --> 10:34.833
I hope everything
is okay.

10:34.867 --> 10:36.833
Listen anyway,
if you wanna try again,

10:36.867 --> 10:38.400
give me a call
at home.

10:38.433 --> 10:42.100
My number is
310-276 (static) 7.

10:42.133 --> 10:43.100
OH, WHAT ?

10:43.133 --> 10:44.933
I DON'T KNOW.
I DIDN'T GET THAT.

10:44.967 --> 10:47.067
THE STUPID
CELL PHONE.

10:47.100 --> 10:49.300
THE SIGNAL FAILED,
THAT'S WHAT THAT'S CALLED.

10:49.333 --> 10:51.300
THAT HAPPENS
WITH A CELL PHONE.

10:51.333 --> 10:52.667
OH, YOU MUST HAVE,
DO YOU HAVE HER NUMBER ?

10:52.700 --> 10:53.700
I HAVE THE NUMBER.

10:53.733 --> 10:56.433
OH, WOULD YOU
GIVE ME HER NUMBER ?

10:56.467 --> 10:57.767
I CAN'T DO THAT,
LARRY.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.533
I CAN'T GIVE YOU
DIANE KEATON'S NUMBER.

11:00.567 --> 11:01.933
WHY NOT ?

11:01.967 --> 11:03.067
SHE LEFT IT ON,
SHE LEFT IT ON THE MACHINE.

11:03.100 --> 11:04.233
YOU JUST HEARD IT
WAS HER.

11:04.267 --> 11:06.100
NO, THAT'S A PRIVACY THING
WITH MY CLIENT.

11:06.133 --> 11:08.267
BUT SHE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO
KNOW THAT YOU GAVE IT TO ME,

11:08.300 --> 11:09.333
BECAUSE SHE LEFT IT
ON MY MACHINE,

11:09.367 --> 11:10.333
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND ?

11:10.367 --> 11:11.833
I CAN'T GIVE
YOU THE NUMBER.

11:11.867 --> 11:13.367
SHE DOESN'T FEEL
COMFORTABLE WITH IT.

11:13.400 --> 11:15.167
COMFORTABLE ? SHE JUST
LEFT IT ON THE MACHINE.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.067
I AM LOYAL
TO MY CLIENT.

11:17.067 --> 11:18.533
THERE'S NO QUESTION
OF LOYALTY HERE !

11:18.567 --> 11:20.200
SHE'S GIVEN ME
HER NUMBER !

11:20.233 --> 11:21.533
LET ME EXPLAIN
SOMETHING TO YOU.

11:21.567 --> 11:23.500
I CAN'T GIVE YOU
EVERYTHING ABOUT HER.

11:23.533 --> 11:26.533
I MEAN, LARRY,
THAT'S A STANDARD THING.

11:26.567 --> 11:28.533
THAT'S WHY I'M WITH HER
SO MANY YEARS.

11:28.567 --> 11:30.633
I AM SORRY, I CAN'T
GIVE YOU THE NUMBER.

11:30.667 --> 11:31.633
I'M NOT GOING TO
GIVE THE NUMBER.

11:31.667 --> 11:33.067
THAT'S NOT
THE WAY I WORK.

11:36.967 --> 11:37.933
( Cheryl )
So, you fired Carmen ?

11:37.967 --> 11:38.967
YEAH.

11:39.067 --> 11:40.567

11:40.600 --> 11:43.100

11:48.267 --> 11:50.433

A BIG FAVOR ?

11:56.533 --> 11:58.633

11:58.667 --> 12:01.867
I OWE HER $3.00,
AND I WANNA PAY HER BACK.

12:01.900 --> 12:03.767
I'M GONNA
GIVE HER $10.00.

12:03.800 --> 12:06.400
I'M GIVING HER SEVEN
MORE DOLLARS, ALRIGHT ?

12:06.433 --> 12:09.800
JUST TELL HER THAT IT'S FROM
THE BALD GUY WITH THE GLASSES.

12:09.833 --> 12:11.833
WE CAN'T TAKE MONEY
FROM PEOPLE.

12:11.867 --> 12:14.733
NO, NO, ALL YOU'RE DOING
IS GIVING IT TO HER.

12:14.767 --> 12:16.600
IT'S POLICY.

12:16.633 --> 12:18.233
WHAT KIND OF POLICY ?

12:18.267 --> 12:20.767
FOR PARKING WE TAKE THE MONEY,
BUT NOT FROM, UH...

12:20.800 --> 12:22.700
THAT'S A POLICY ?

12:22.733 --> 12:23.733
YOU CAN'T GIVE
YOUR FRIEND MONEY ?

12:23.767 --> 12:24.867
THAT'S A VERY
STRANGE POLICY.

12:24.900 --> 12:26.233
I CAN'T BE HELD
RESPONSIBLE.

12:26.267 --> 12:28.400
NO, I'M NOT HOLDING
YOU RESPONSIBLE,

12:28.433 --> 12:29.467
JUST GIVE HER THE...

12:29.500 --> 12:31.067

12:31.100 --> 12:35.067
NO, YOU'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE, BUT
I'M ASKING YOU DO TO ME A FAVOR.

12:35.067 --> 12:36.667
I OWE HER MONEY,
I MIGHT NOT SEE HER...

12:36.700 --> 12:38.267
AND I WANNA MAKE SURE
SHE GETS PAID, OKAY ?

12:38.300 --> 12:39.833
OKAY, I WILL GIVE
HER THIS FROM YOU ?

12:39.867 --> 12:41.300
THANK YOU, YEAH,

12:45.933 --> 12:47.633

WITH THE GLASSES.

12:47.667 --> 12:49.967
THE BALD MAN WITH
THE GLASSES, IS YOU.

12:50.067 --> 12:51.433
UNFORTUNATELY
THAT'S ME.

12:51.467 --> 12:52.933
IT'S A GOOD LOOK.

12:52.967 --> 12:54.100
OH, YEAH, THANKS.

12:54.133 --> 12:58.767
ANYWAY, THANKS,

13:26.967 --> 13:28.067
WHAT'S THIS ?

13:28.100 --> 13:30.600
AY.

13:30.633 --> 13:32.500
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
IS THIS YOUR NEW OFFICE ?

13:32.533 --> 13:33.500
HOW COME YOU'RE NOT
IN YOUR OFFICE ?

13:33.533 --> 13:35.200
NO MY OFFICE
IS BEING PAINTED.

13:35.233 --> 13:37.500
WELL, WHERE SHOULD
I SIT ?

13:37.533 --> 13:39.100
ANYWHERE YOU WANT.

13:39.133 --> 13:40.767
AS FAR AWAY FROM YOU, AS FAR
AWAY FROM YOU AS POSSIBLE.

13:40.800 --> 13:42.233
OH, THAT'S VERY NICE.

13:42.267 --> 13:44.433
THANK YOU,
VERY NICE.

13:44.467 --> 13:46.800
I'LL SIT BY THE DOOR IN CASE
YOU COME AFTER ME OR SOMETHING,

13:46.833 --> 13:48.200
AND I CAN RUN OUT.

13:48.233 --> 13:50.233
LARRY, I RAN INTO
DIANE KEATON'S AGENT.

13:50.267 --> 13:51.267
UH-HUH.

13:51.300 --> 13:53.200
WHAT IS THAT ?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

13:53.233 --> 13:56.300
BECAUSE I TOOK SO LONG IN
YOUR HUSBAND'S OFFICE THAT DAY.

13:56.333 --> 13:58.567
HE KEPT ME WAITING
FOR 45 MINUTES

13:58.600 --> 14:00.233
BECAUSE OF HIS
RIDICULOUS POLICY,

14:00.267 --> 14:01.667
WAITING POLICY
THAT HE HAS,

14:01.700 --> 14:03.467
THAT I MISSED MY APPOINTMENT
WITH DIANE KEATON.

14:03.500 --> 14:05.633
WELL, HOW, YOU KNOW,
SHE'S ANGRY.

14:05.667 --> 14:06.633
YOU MISSED
THE MEETING

14:06.667 --> 14:08.067
THEN I HEARD YOU
DIDN'T RETURN HER CALL.

14:08.100 --> 14:10.067
DON'T WORRY, JEFF SET UP
ANOTHER MEETING FOR LATER.

14:10.067 --> 14:11.533
I'M GONNA STRAIGHTEN
THE WHOLE THING OUT.

14:11.567 --> 14:13.067
I'M A MASTER
OF SUPPLICATION.

14:13.067 --> 14:14.400
ALRIGHT,
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

14:14.433 --> 14:15.500
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
I HAVE TO MENTION TO YOU

14:15.533 --> 14:16.667
AND I CAN'T REMEMBER--

14:16.700 --> 14:18.100
OH, I HAVE SOMETHING

14:24.567 --> 14:25.933
MM-HMM.

14:25.967 --> 14:27.867
AND I THOUGHT I WAS ALL PAID UP
AND EVERYTHING 'CAUSE...

14:27.900 --> 14:28.933
RIGHT.

14:28.967 --> 14:30.867
IT'S FOR READING
YOUR SCRIPT.

14:33.067 --> 14:35.433
THAT'S A JOKE,
RIGHT ?

14:35.467 --> 14:37.067
NO.

14:37.067 --> 14:39.433
YOU'RE NOT KIDDING.

14:39.467 --> 14:41.400
ARE YOU KIDDING ?

14:41.433 --> 14:43.133

14:46.633 --> 14:47.833
RIGHT, THAT'S--

14:47.867 --> 14:50.400
AND THEN YOU CHARGE ME
FOR READING MY SCRIPT ?

14:50.433 --> 14:52.867
I'M SORRY, BUT THAT'S
STANDARD PRACTICE.

14:52.900 --> 14:56.100
I THINK, I CHARGE $1500,
THAT'S THREE HOURS.

14:56.133 --> 14:58.900
AND, YOU KNOW, IT TOOK ME
FOUR HOURS TO GO THROUGH IT.

14:58.933 --> 15:00.767
OH, I'M SORRY FOR
TAKING UP YOUR TIME.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.200
AND YOU KNOW WHAT,
QUITE FRANKLY,

15:02.233 --> 15:04.200
I SHOULD HAVE READ IT
BECAUSE IT NEEDS WORK.

15:04.233 --> 15:07.867
I AM NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR
CREATIVE INPUT ABOUT ANYTHING.

15:07.900 --> 15:09.233
WELL, I'M SORRY TO
TELL YOU THIS,

15:09.267 --> 15:10.767
BUT I ALSO

15:10.800 --> 15:11.767
AND I'M GONNA BILL YOU
FOR THAT TOO.

NOT WORKING FOR ME AT ALL.

15:19.467 --> 15:21.267

WHAT'S NOT WORKING FOR ME, YOU.

15:21.300 --> 15:22.600

WHAT ELSE ?

15:24.067 --> 15:27.200

16:43.800 --> 16:45.400
$30 YOU GOT FROM ME !

16:45.433 --> 16:46.833
I HEARD YOU !

17:00.600 --> 17:01.567
HI.

17:01.600 --> 17:02.600
HI.

17:02.633 --> 17:04.233

17:08.967 --> 17:11.867
OH, MY GOD, YOU KNOW WHAT ?
I GAVE THE $20.

17:11.900 --> 17:12.867
I JUST SAW JOANNA--

17:12.900 --> 17:13.867
I REMEMBER YOU.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.633
I GAVE HER
MY LAST $20 AND...

17:16.667 --> 17:19.067
I NEED THE OTHER $10 NOW.

17:19.067 --> 17:21.300
EXCUSE ME, I'M GONNA
NEED THE OTHER 10.

17:21.333 --> 17:23.400

FOR PARKING.

17:23.433 --> 17:24.467
AND THEN WHAT ?

17:24.500 --> 17:26.267
I ALREADY PAID HER
IN THE GARAGE.

17:26.300 --> 17:27.667
I PAID HER
THE MONEY I OWE HER.

17:27.700 --> 17:28.900
I GAVE HER $20.

17:28.933 --> 17:30.833
I OWED HER THREE
AND I PAID HER 20,

17:30.867 --> 17:34.333
SO, I NEED THE $10 BACK NOW
BECAUSE I PAID HER THE $20.

17:34.367 --> 17:36.567
THIS IS WHY I DON'T
DO FAVORS FOR PEOPLE.

17:36.600 --> 17:37.600
BUT LISTEN, SIR.

17:37.633 --> 17:39.067

17:42.200 --> 17:43.200

17:43.233 --> 17:44.300
I'M HONEST PERSON.

17:44.333 --> 17:45.667

17:45.700 --> 17:46.767
YOU TOLD ME TO
GIVE THIS TO HER ?

17:46.800 --> 17:47.900

I'M GOING TO DO.

17:47.933 --> 17:49.800
ALL I NEED FROM YOU IS
2.20 AND WE DONE.

17:49.833 --> 17:51.900
BUT I GAVE YOU THE MONEY,
SO GIVE THE MONEY BACK TO ME.

17:51.933 --> 17:53.600
LET'S JUST PRETEND
IT NEVER HAPPENED.

17:53.633 --> 17:56.467
GO BACK AN HOUR AND PRETEND
THIS NEVER HAPPENED, OKAY ?

17:56.500 --> 17:57.467
JUST GO BACK AN HOUR ?

17:57.500 --> 17:59.800
GO BACK AN HOUR,
PRETEND I NEVER CAME IN.

17:59.833 --> 18:01.167
WHEN I DON'T WANT
TO TAKE THE MONEY ?

18:01.200 --> 18:02.667
AND YOU SAY, "TAKE MONEY
TO GIVE TO HER" ?

18:02.700 --> 18:06.200
AND I PROMISE YOU I GIVE HER
MONEY, GO BACK TO THAT ?

18:06.233 --> 18:08.300
EXCUSE ME, PLEASE !

18:08.333 --> 18:10.767
HOW DO I KNOW NOW
THAT YOU PAY HER MONEY ?

18:10.800 --> 18:11.800
I'LL GET YOUR MONEY.

18:11.833 --> 18:12.867
OH, YOU GET ME MONEY.

18:12.900 --> 18:14.400
YOU KNOW, NEVER HAVE
MONEY FOR PARKING.

18:14.433 --> 18:16.333
YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL CAR,
BUT NO MONEY FOR PARKING.

18:16.367 --> 18:18.933
( male )
THIS IS THE SECOND TIME YOU
DON'T HAVE MONEY FOR PARKING.

18:18.967 --> 18:22.067
YOU THINK YOU CAN
LOAN ME $2.20 ?

18:22.067 --> 18:24.767
HE'S JUST NOT
GONNA LET ME OUT.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.500
I'M JUST OUT OF MONEY.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.933
MAYBE MAKE IT A FIVE,
GREAT, OKAY.

18:31.967 --> 18:33.400
LARRY, DON'T TOUCH
MY CAR.

18:33.433 --> 18:34.467
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT ?

18:34.500 --> 18:35.900
I'M GONNA
GIVE YOU BACK $10.

18:35.933 --> 18:37.333
I'LL MAKE IT
WORTH YOUR WHILE.

18:37.367 --> 18:39.100
$10, I PROMISE.

18:39.133 --> 18:40.233
THANK YOU.

18:48.500 --> 18:49.667
WHERE YOU BEEN ?

18:49.700 --> 18:51.933
I HAD A PROBLEM IN
THE GARAGE WITH THIS WOMAN

18:51.967 --> 18:53.267
AND THEN I DIDN'T HAVE MONEY
TO PAY FOR THE PARKING.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.967
IT'S ALWAYS
THE PARKING.

18:55.067 --> 18:56.367
I'M CONVINCED YOU DON'T
WANT TO MEET DIANE KEATON.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.433
THAT'S WHAT
I'M CONVINCED OF.

18:57.467 --> 18:58.700
WELL, I'M HERE,
AREN'T I ?

18:58.733 --> 19:00.533
YEAH, YOU'RE HERE,
BUT YOU'RE A HALF HOUR LATE.

19:00.567 --> 19:02.100
WHAT ARE
YOU THINKING ?

19:05.233 --> 19:06.833
THE GUY WOULDN'T
GIVE ME BACK MY OWN $10.

19:06.867 --> 19:07.967
HI, ARE YOU LARRY ?

19:08.067 --> 19:08.967
YES.

19:09.067 --> 19:10.633
GREAT, DIANE'S BEEN WAITING,
COME ON IN.

19:10.667 --> 19:11.800
THANK YOU.

19:11.833 --> 19:13.233
HI, JEFF GREEN.

19:13.267 --> 19:15.133
HI, KIM,
I'M DIANE'S ASSISTANT.

19:15.167 --> 19:16.467
HI, NICE TO MEET YOU.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.500
( Diane )
LARRY, IS THAT YOU ?

19:18.533 --> 19:20.533
OH, HI, DIANE,
I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

19:20.567 --> 19:21.900
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT, OKAY ?

19:21.933 --> 19:22.967
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

19:23.067 --> 19:24.800
MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME,
ALRIGHT ?

19:24.833 --> 19:26.733
UM, YOU CAN TAKE A SEAT
RIGHT OVER HERE AND WAIT.

19:26.767 --> 19:28.067
OKAY, THANK YOU.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.867
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING TO DRINK,
SOME COFFEE, WATER, JUICE ?

19:30.900 --> 19:31.967
NO, THANK YOU.

19:32.067 --> 19:33.333
I'M FINE, THANK YOU.

19:33.367 --> 19:35.267
OKAY, JUST LET ME
KNOW IF YOU NEED...

19:39.833 --> 19:41.167
DID SHE HAVE AN ATTITUDE,
THAT WOMAN ?

19:41.200 --> 19:42.233
OR IS IT
MY IMAGINATION ?

19:42.267 --> 19:43.567
SHE HAD
AN ATTITUDE.

19:43.600 --> 19:44.600
BIG TIME.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.067
WHAT ARE LOOKING AT ?

19:50.100 --> 19:52.133
THAT LAMP LOOKS
VERY FAMILIAR.

19:53.800 --> 19:54.900
( Diane )
THANK YOU !

19:54.933 --> 19:56.200
I'LL SEE YOU
IN A WEEK.

19:56.233 --> 19:58.933
OKAY, DIANE, I'LL CALL YOU
WHEN I GET THE MATERIAL.

19:58.967 --> 20:00.067
BYE, BYE.

20:04.933 --> 20:06.167
OF COURSE...

20:06.200 --> 20:08.367
WHEN SHE TOLD ME A "LARRY"
KEPT HER WAITING,

20:08.400 --> 20:09.800
I SHOULD HAVE
KNOWN IT WAS YOU.

20:09.833 --> 20:11.600
LISTEN, YOU FIRE ME,
THAT'S FINE.

20:11.633 --> 20:12.733
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY TASTE,
YOU DON'T WANT MY SERVICE,

20:12.767 --> 20:14.000
THAT'S FINE.

20:14.033 --> 20:16.833
BUT YOU OWE ME A CHECK
AND I EXPECT TO GET PAID.

20:16.867 --> 20:18.367
SO, I WANT
THE CHECK TODAY.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.467
OKAY, YOU SHOULD HAVE
GOTTEN THE CHECK.

20:20.500 --> 20:23.233
LARRY, I DON'T
RECEIVE THE CHECK.

20:23.267 --> 20:24.233
PLEASE, I AM
A REASONABLE PERSON.

20:24.267 --> 20:25.267
I WANT YOU TO
GIVE ME THE CHECK.

20:25.300 --> 20:26.333
MY BUSINESS MANAGER
MAILED THE CHECK.

20:26.367 --> 20:27.400
I WANT THE MONEY NOW.

20:27.433 --> 20:28.700
YOU WANT ME TO
WRITE A CHECK RIGHT NOW ?

20:28.733 --> 20:30.700
YOU FIRE ME ?
I HAVE A REPUTATION.

20:30.733 --> 20:31.900
AND I HAVE A HISTORY
WITH DIANE--

20:31.933 --> 20:33.767
WELL, I DON'T
HAVE A CHECK ON ME.

20:33.800 --> 20:34.800
QUIET DOWN,
WILL YOU ?

20:34.833 --> 20:36.400
LISTEN, YOU TELL ME
TO BE QUIET ?

20:36.433 --> 20:37.533
WILL YOU JUST
QUIET DOWN ?

20:37.567 --> 20:39.300
I WILL TELL DIANE
NOT TO WORK WITH YOU.

20:39.333 --> 20:40.800
WAIT A SECOND, WAIT A SECOND,
YOU'LL GET YOUR CHECK.

20:40.833 --> 20:43.167
YOU LISTEN TO ME !
DON'T TELL ME TO SHUT UP.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.500
I DON'T CARRY
CHECKS ON ME.

20:44.533 --> 20:45.533
STOP THAT !

20:45.567 --> 20:46.567
GIVE ME MY MONEY !

20:46.600 --> 20:47.967
LARRY !

20:48.867 --> 20:49.867
HEY, STOP IT !

20:49.900 --> 20:51.167
DON'T, LARRY !

20:51.200 --> 20:52.500
( glass shattering )

20:52.533 --> 20:55.400
LARRY,
YOU'RE AN ANIMAL !

20:56.533 --> 20:57.967
OH, LARRY.

21:03.600 --> 21:04.700
HI, DIANE.

21:31.667 --> 21:33.667
EXCUSE ME, DO YOU
HAVE CHANGE FOR $20 ?

21:33.700 --> 21:35.900
SORRY.

21:35.933 --> 21:37.600
UH, DO YOU HAVE
ANY CHANGE ON YOU ?

21:37.633 --> 21:38.667
I NEED MONEY.

21:38.700 --> 21:39.667
NO ?

21:39.700 --> 21:40.800
DO YOU HAVE
ANY CHANGE ON YOU ?

21:40.833 --> 21:41.833
JUST A QUARTER ?

21:41.867 --> 21:44.300
YOU CAN'T
SPARE A QUARTER ?

21:56.533 --> 21:57.700
HOLD THE ELEVATOR
PLEASE ?

22:40.400 --> 22:42.067
( heavy breathing )

22:44.600 --> 22:45.633
OH.

22:51.233 --> 22:52.400
BAD FINGER.

23:01.433 --> 23:02.667
OH.

23:29.267 --> 23:30.300
HOW YOU DOING ?

23:32.133 --> 23:33.733
BAD FINGER.

23:35.133 --> 23:38.200
* BAD FINGER

23:38.233 --> 23:39.633
* HE'S THE MAN

23:39.667 --> 23:43.867
* THE MAN
WITH THE MIDAS TOUCH *

23:44.800 --> 23:47.067
* A SPIDER'S TOUCH

23:47.100 --> 23:48.067
MARISSA WINNAKER ?

23:48.100 --> 23:49.100
YEAH.

23:49.133 --> 23:50.133
UH, WINOKER ?

23:50.167 --> 23:51.333
DR. LYNCH IS
READY TO SEE YOU.

23:51.367 --> 23:52.367
ROOM EIGHT.

23:52.400 --> 23:54.467
OH, THANKS.

23:55.867 --> 23:58.600
WHOA, I DON'T UNDERSTAND,
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE ?

23:58.633 --> 24:00.700
I CAME IN BEFORE HER,
I SIGNED IN THE SHEET.

24:00.733 --> 24:03.467
WELL, YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO KNOW,
THEY'VE CHANGED POLICY.

24:03.500 --> 24:04.867
CHANGED POLICIES, WHAT ?

24:04.900 --> 24:07.233
NOW WE SEE PEOPLE ON THE
BASIS OF THEIR APPOINTMENT TIME

24:07.267 --> 24:08.300
AND NOT THEIR ARRIVAL TIME.

24:08.333 --> 24:09.333
NO, BUT THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

24:09.367 --> 24:10.433
ONE PERSON COMPLAINS

24:10.467 --> 24:11.633
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
EVERYTHING GETS CHANGED ?

24:11.667 --> 24:13.300
THIS WAS BASED ON
YOUR IDEA THE OTHER DAY.

24:13.333 --> 24:14.667
I KNOW, BUT WHAT ARE YOU
LISTENING TO ME FOR ?

24:14.700 --> 24:16.667
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT,
NOBODY LISTENS TO ME.

24:16.700 --> 24:18.833
SO APPARENTLY, IT'S NOT
ABOUT THE POLICY AT ALL.

24:18.867 --> 24:20.400
IT'S MORE JUST
ABOUT YOU GOING FIRST ?

24:20.433 --> 24:21.633
EXACTLY.

24:21.667 --> 24:24.067
SO, IF YOU GO FIRST,
WHATEVER POLICY THAT IS--

24:24.100 --> 24:27.200
THAT'S A GOOD POLICY,
ME FIRST, THAT'S THE POLICY.

24:27.233 --> 24:28.900
FROM NOW ON, YOU KNOW
WHAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE
IN THIS OFFICE ?

24:28.933 --> 24:29.967
THE "YOU FIRST POLICY".

24:30.067 --> 24:31.067
THANK YOU.

24:31.067 --> 24:32.067
DOES THAT
MAKE YOU HAPPY ?

24:32.067 --> 24:33.400
YES, THAT MAKES ME HAPPY.

24:33.433 --> 24:35.433
GOOD, RIGHT AFTER TODAY,
HAVE A SEAT, READ A MAGAZINE.

24:35.467 --> 24:37.933
DOCTOR WILL BE WITH YOU
IN A FEW MINUTES, THANK YOU.

24:45.133 --> 24:48.100
SO, YOU KNOW THEY CHANGED
THE POLICY, RIGHT ?

24:48.133 --> 24:50.133
USED TO BE FIRST COME,
FIRST SERVED.

24:50.167 --> 24:52.067
NOW, IT'S APPOINTMENT.

24:52.067 --> 24:53.367
OH, REALLY ?

24:53.400 --> 24:55.200
THAT'S FASCINATING,
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

24:55.233 --> 24:56.767
OH, NO, IT'S TRUE.

24:58.100 --> 25:02.067
OH, CONGRATULATIONS,
SHE EMERGES.

25:02.100 --> 25:03.833
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THERE
FOR 45 MINUTES ANYWAY ?

25:03.867 --> 25:05.200
ARE YOU OKAY ?

25:14.533 --> 25:16.633
LASSIE MAVEN ?

25:17.833 --> 25:20.167
LASSIE ?

25:20.200 --> 25:21.233
HA, HA.

25:21.267 --> 25:22.633
OH.

25:22.667 --> 25:24.833
OH, I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T
REALIZE THAT WAS YOU, MR. DOFF.

25:24.867 --> 25:26.067
RIGHT THIS WAY.

25:29.167 --> 25:30.833
DOCTOR WILL BE
RIGHT IN TO SEE YOU.

25:38.933 --> 25:39.933
HI, LARRY.

25:39.967 --> 25:41.333
HI.

25:41.367 --> 25:44.467
SO, SO, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE POLICY ?

25:44.500 --> 25:47.067
WE CHANGED THE POLICY
AFTER WE HAD THE DISCUSSION

25:47.100 --> 25:48.833
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK,
WE JUST CHANGED THE POLICY.

25:48.867 --> 25:49.933
JUST LIKE THAT ?

25:49.967 --> 25:51.067
JUST LIKE THAT.

25:51.067 --> 25:53.067
M.D. MAKES DECISIONS.

25:53.100 --> 25:54.500
WHAT HAVE WE GOT ?

25:54.533 --> 25:56.200
THE FINGER,
STILL BOTHERING YOU ?

25:56.233 --> 25:57.400
MUCH, MUCH WORSE.

25:57.433 --> 25:58.467
MUCH WORSE,
I GOT, I GOT--

25:58.500 --> 25:59.500
WHAT HAPPENED ?

25:59.533 --> 26:00.633
I GOT IN A FIGHT.

26:00.667 --> 26:02.800
WASN'T THE FIRST INCIDENT
A FIGHT AS WELL ?

26:02.833 --> 26:04.267
YOU BE VERY
CAREFUL THERE.

26:04.300 --> 26:05.267
OKAY, THIS IS
ANOTHER FIGHT ?

26:05.300 --> 26:06.267
YEAH, YEAH.

26:06.300 --> 26:08.300
AND WHO,
SAME PERSON ?

26:08.333 --> 26:09.933
NO, AN INTERIOR DECORATOR.

26:09.967 --> 26:12.300
YOU'RE FIGHTING
INTERIOR DECORATORS ?

26:12.333 --> 26:14.300
AND I ALSO HAD
AN ALTERCATION

26:14.333 --> 26:17.367
IN THE HALL WITH
ONE OF YOUR PATIENTS.

26:17.400 --> 26:19.600
WHEN'S THE NEXT FIGHT,
MAYBE I'D LIKE TO SEE IT ?

26:19.633 --> 26:20.633
AH !

26:20.667 --> 26:21.900
VERY SORRY,
AND WHEN I DO THIS ?

26:21.933 --> 26:22.967
SAME THING,
WORSE WHEN I DO THIS ?

26:23.067 --> 26:24.300
YES, YES.

26:24.333 --> 26:26.500
YOU HAVE
FRACTURED IT.

26:26.533 --> 26:27.533
IT'S A HAIRLINE
FRACTURE.

26:27.567 --> 26:29.067
IT'S A SMALL ONE,
BUT IT IS FRACTURED.

26:29.100 --> 26:31.200
REALLY ?
MM-HMM.

26:31.233 --> 26:32.700
SO, WHAT ARE
WE GONNA DO ?

26:32.733 --> 26:33.933
WHAT DO YOU DO ?

26:33.967 --> 26:36.133
WELL, I CAN'T DO ANYTHING,
UH, RIGHT NOW.

26:36.167 --> 26:37.433
I CAN'T DO
ANYTHING, LARRY,

26:37.467 --> 26:41.767
UNTIL YOU PAY MY WIFE'S FEE
AND MY FEE, IN ADVANCE.

26:41.800 --> 26:43.267
THAT'S THE WAY
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS.

26:45.867 --> 26:47.700
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, OKAY, JOHN ?

26:47.733 --> 26:50.167
I DIDN'T ASK HER
TO READ THAT SCRIPT.

26:50.200 --> 26:51.200
SHE READ
THE SCRIPT, LARRY.

26:51.233 --> 26:52.267
SHE DIDN'T HAVE
TO READ THAT SCRIPT.

26:52.300 --> 26:53.300
SHE DID
READ IT THOUGH.

26:53.333 --> 26:54.467
BUT WHO TOLD HER
TO READ IT ?

26:54.500 --> 26:57.567
SHE READ IT AS
A COURTESY TO YOU,
AS A FRIEND.

26:57.600 --> 26:59.400
THAT'S A COURTESY ?
THAT'S SOME COURTESY.

26:59.433 --> 27:00.900
I'D LIKE TO GET COURTESY
LIKE THAT FROM EVERYBODY,

27:00.933 --> 27:02.133
BOY, I'LL BE
IN THE POORHOUSE.

27:02.167 --> 27:03.433
YOU'D BE LUCKY
IF YOU DID.

27:03.467 --> 27:06.067
SHE TOOK THE TIME
FROM HER DAY.

27:06.100 --> 27:07.967
SHE MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT
NOTES ON THAT SCRIPT.

27:08.067 --> 27:09.167
WHO GIVES A SHIT
ABOUT HER NOTES ?

27:09.200 --> 27:10.733
I DIDN'T ASK HER TO
READ THAT SCRIPT.

27:10.767 --> 27:11.733
I DON'T
WANT HER NOTES.

27:11.767 --> 27:12.767
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT HER NOTES.

27:12.800 --> 27:13.900
I DON'T
NEED HER NOTES.

27:13.933 --> 27:14.900
HOW ABOUT THE FINGER ?
DO YOU CARE ABOUT THAT ?

27:14.933 --> 27:16.067
YES, I DO.

27:16.100 --> 27:18.567
HERE'S WHAT'S GONNA
HAPPEN WITH THAT, PAL O' MINE.

27:18.600 --> 27:20.233
HER MONEY UP FRONT,
MY MONEY RIGHT NOW

27:20.267 --> 27:21.267
AND THEN WE TAKE
A LOOK AT THE FINGER.

27:21.300 --> 27:22.267
HOW DO YOU
FEEL ABOUT THAT ?

27:22.300 --> 27:25.400
'CAUSE THAT'S THE GAME
WE'RE PLAYING NOW.

27:25.433 --> 27:27.267
WHAT, DO YOU NEED
A COUPLE OF MINUTES ?

27:27.300 --> 27:29.300
'CAUSE I GOT SOME PATIENTS
I COULD LOOK AT OUT THERE.

27:30.367 --> 27:32.300
YOU KNOW WHAT ?
THIS IS EMBARRASSING.

27:32.333 --> 27:33.367
YEAH.

27:33.400 --> 27:34.400
YOU SHOULD
BE EMBARRASSED.

27:34.433 --> 27:36.633
NOT EMBARRASSED FOR ME.

27:36.667 --> 27:37.933
ALRIGHT, GIVE ME
A COUPLE MINUTES,

27:37.967 --> 27:39.067
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK IN,
WE'LL FIX THAT FINGER.

27:39.100 --> 27:40.567
HEY, YOU'RE GONNA
GET MILES.
