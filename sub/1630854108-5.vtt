So, let me get this straight.

00:08.300 --> 00:10.636
You told our neighbor who's been so rude,

00:10.636 --> 00:13.013
that we'd take care of his big creepy dog,

00:13.013 --> 00:14.515

a dog around the house.

Look at him. He's so sweet.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.229

- Oh, that is the call.

00:20.229 --> 00:22.064
That is the call. Okay.
Ring, ring.

00:22.064 --> 00:23.148
Where is my phone?

00:23.148 --> 00:24.900
Uh, I think the dog's sitting on it.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.818
Oh, okay. I gotta take this. Shoo-shoo.

00:26.818 --> 00:27.861
Bye-bye.

Ring, ring.

00:32.573 --> 00:35.118
Oh my God. The dog swallowed my phone.

00:46.463 --> 00:48.507
You were right about the Josie joke.

00:48.507 --> 00:50.425
Cleveland is funnier than Milwaukee.

00:50.425 --> 00:52.344
And yet in real life?
Milwaukee, funnier.

Hey Gordon, Hannah.
Really nice rewrite last night.

00:54.638 --> 00:56.390
- Good, good.
- I just have a few tiny concerns

00:56.390 --> 00:57.933
about a couple of spots specifically--

00:57.933 --> 01:00.269
Yeah, you know what? Hold that thought.
Just hold. Let me grab a pen.

01:00.978 --> 01:02.354
Be right with you.

01:02.354 --> 01:04.147
What the hell?

01:04.606 --> 01:06.900
Yeah. So I thought it
played much better, right?

01:06.900 --> 01:08.402
Not an idiot.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.444
What?

01:09.444 --> 01:11.405
Well, your dad, he's not grabbing a pen.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.532
- No, he just said he's--
- He's not coming back.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.495
How can I help?

01:18.495 --> 01:21.081
Well, he never wants to hear
any of my thoughts or concerns.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.749
I'm sorry. Maybe you should just

01:22.749 --> 01:23.876
work out your shit with him.

01:23.876 --> 01:26.336
I don't think you
realize how hurtful it is

01:26.336 --> 01:28.380
to have him just walk out on me like that.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.215

She's the sweetest,
cutest dog you've ever seen.

Oh, is that why you looked
so sad after the run-through?

03:51.899 --> 03:53.984

But she's so mad at me
for breaking up with her,

03:58.989 --> 04:00.365
she won't let me see Butternut.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.950
But that is a long story.

04:01.950 --> 04:02.868
Yeah, you don't have to--

04:02.868 --> 04:05.037
We met at my friend
David's bar mitzvah.

04:06.038 --> 04:07.873
She was right behind me
in the grind train.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.349
I'm a little in over my head.

04:26.016 --> 04:28.018

and ask you some questions?

04:31.063 --> 04:32.981

You know, where there's
an elderly man who still has to work

04:46.703 --> 04:49.164
and he makes you a Caesar salad
right at the table.

04:49.164 --> 04:50.832
And half the desserts are served on fire.

04:50.832 --> 04:53.126
You had me at elderly man
who still has to work.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.127
Great.

09:15.556 --> 09:17.349
Do you know how to drop a pin?

09:17.349 --> 09:19.476
I don't have a fucking pin!

09:19.476 --> 09:21.019
Not that kind of pin.

09:21.019 --> 09:22.896
- Listen to me.
- Okay.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.064
<i>When we hang up,</i>

09:24.064 --> 09:26.984
I want you to hold up your phone and say,

09:26.984 --> 09:29.987
"Hey Siri, send Clay my location."

09:29.987 --> 09:31.655
Okay, okay.

09:31.655 --> 09:32.865
Repeat that.

09:32.865 --> 09:34.408
Sarah, send me on vacation!

09:48.130 --> 09:50.424
You a Clippers fan by any chance?

09:50.424 --> 09:51.633
Not really.

09:51.633 --> 09:52.885
Lakers?

09:52.885 --> 09:54.219
Actually, I've been living in New York

09:54.219 --> 09:55.304
for the last 15 years, so.

09:55.304 --> 09:56.638
It's Nicks.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.724
Not a big NBA guy.

10:00.225 --> 10:02.477
So what the fuck would
you bring up New York for?

10:03.520 --> 10:05.689
You, you're something else, man.

10:05.689 --> 10:07.024
Okay.

10:07.024 --> 10:09.026
What, what is your problem with me?

10:09.026 --> 10:10.777
Well, for one you don't like basketball.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.446
Fucking-A. I'm serious.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.781
No, I know that.
You're always serious.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.533
And you overthink everything,

10:16.533 --> 10:17.993
then you're never happy.

10:17.993 --> 10:19.620
You are never happy.

10:19.620 --> 10:22.623
I, you get a script,
and instead of thinking, gee,

10:22.623 --> 10:25.709
what can I do to make this the funniest,
and the best it can be?

10:25.709 --> 10:28.295
You decide that, no, right away it stinks.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.796
The script stinks and I stink

10:29.796 --> 10:31.673
and everything needs to be rewritten.

10:32.424 --> 10:34.927
And what makes it especially galling,

10:34.927 --> 10:36.345
is that you actually have the rare gift

10:36.345 --> 10:37.846
of being fucking funny.

10:37.846 --> 10:39.556
I'm telling you, your comedic timing when

10:39.556 --> 10:42.434
you don't get in your own way,
swear to George Burns,

10:42.434 --> 10:43.644
it's impeccable.

10:43.644 --> 10:45.187
It's like, like music.

10:45.187 --> 10:48.357
You could be one of the greatest
comedic actors of all time.

10:48.357 --> 10:49.942
You remember those hilarious movies

10:49.942 --> 10:52.611
that Sir Laurence Olivier
and Daniel Day-Lewis did?

10:52.611 --> 10:54.112
What...? No.

10:54.112 --> 10:56.657
Exactly.
'Cause they couldn't do it.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.867
But you, you have the superpower, man.

10:58.867 --> 11:01.411
You, you can make
millions of people laugh.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.664
And to put that out into the world,

11:03.664 --> 11:08.377
to bring people a little joy
at the end of their shit day.

11:08.377 --> 11:10.420
Fuck you for not appreciating that.

11:10.420 --> 11:11.505
'Cause I swear to God,

11:11.505 --> 11:13.006
that is as good and honorable thing

11:13.006 --> 11:14.508
as a man can do.

11:18.303 --> 11:19.471
Uh...

11:20.806 --> 11:22.432
Well, Gordon, I'm speechless.

11:22.808 --> 11:23.851
Oh.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.562
Shit, if I knew that's all it took,

11:26.562 --> 11:28.480
I would've complimented you years ago.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.025
Bree!

11:34.528 --> 11:35.571
Damn.

11:36.154 --> 11:37.155
Duchess?

11:38.907 --> 11:42.202
Got a big movie producer here
who wants to meet you.

11:45.414 --> 11:47.082
Oh, shit.

11:47.082 --> 11:50.335
- Die dragon!
- Whoa! Jesus.

11:55.507 --> 11:56.675
You're joking.

11:58.260 --> 12:00.345
Okay, here we go.

12:00.345 --> 12:02.139
In the truck and I'll drive you home.

12:02.139 --> 12:05.893
Whoa, toxic masculinity much?

12:05.893 --> 12:07.686
Bree, I'm not fucking around.

12:07.686 --> 12:09.271
I have some place I need to be.

12:09.271 --> 12:11.398
And these aren't the type
of people you keep waiting.

12:11.398 --> 12:14.151
Okay, Clay.

12:16.445 --> 12:19.698
It is too blue in here.

12:19.698 --> 12:21.992
No, no!

12:22.534 --> 12:24.119
But do they call me

12:24.119 --> 12:26.496
MacGregor the ship builder? No.

12:26.496 --> 12:29.166
You see that pier?
I built that pier meself

12:29.166 --> 12:30.375
with me own hands.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.836
It could withstand the--
the mightiest of storms,

12:32.836 --> 12:36.131
but do they ever call me
MacGregor the pier builder?

12:36.131 --> 12:37.174
No!

12:37.174 --> 12:39.259
But you fuck one goat.

12:43.972 --> 12:46.642
He's MacGregor the goat fucker.

12:46.642 --> 12:48.852
How have you never heard that joke?

12:48.852 --> 12:50.437
Oh my God.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.856
You need, you need to read less.

12:52.856 --> 12:54.441
Oh, God. You are funny.

12:55.567 --> 12:56.944
I didn't write damn the thing.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.362
Who writes those things? I don't--

12:58.362 --> 13:00.155
Somewhere there's a genius in a basement.

13:00.155 --> 13:04.117
No, no, Gordon.
I mean you are funny.

13:04.493 --> 13:06.078
I don't say that enough.

13:06.078 --> 13:08.121
- You never say it.
- Well, but I should.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.123
Because it's true. Okay?

13:10.123 --> 13:12.209
And you are smart.

13:12.209 --> 13:14.044
And that's why I get so--

13:15.087 --> 13:16.421
Never mind. Forget it.

13:16.421 --> 13:17.673
No. What, what, what?

13:17.673 --> 13:19.174
Say it, you schmuck.

13:19.174 --> 13:20.717
What-- That's why what?

13:22.594 --> 13:24.638
It's why I get so frustrated.

13:24.638 --> 13:28.433
You are smart. You are quick.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.352
You are perceptive,

13:30.352 --> 13:34.189
and more sensitive than
you want anyone to think.

13:34.189 --> 13:37.401
But I don't understand why you,

13:37.401 --> 13:39.194
why you don't go there.

13:39.194 --> 13:40.404
Why you don't dig deeper.

13:40.404 --> 13:41.738
I mean, we could have told stories

13:41.738 --> 13:44.783
about things that
real families go through.

13:44.783 --> 13:46.118
- Yeah, well.
- You know what I mean?

13:46.118 --> 13:49.621
And instead, you know, what did we do?

13:49.621 --> 13:53.500
We did an entire episode
based on a Y2K pun.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.710
Ugh.

13:54.710 --> 13:57.171
Why too gay? Yes.

13:57.171 --> 13:59.631
Boy, that Brian Boitano.
He could land a triple axel.

13:59.631 --> 14:00.591
Couldn't land a single joke.

14:00.591 --> 14:02.217
See, that's what I mean.

14:02.217 --> 14:03.760
I am trying to tell you something

14:03.760 --> 14:05.137
that I've wanted to say for a long time.

14:05.137 --> 14:06.555
That's hard for me to say.
- Okay.

14:06.555 --> 14:08.682
And you, you always
have to go for the joke.

14:08.682 --> 14:10.475
I didn't hear a laugh.
Did you hear a laugh?

14:10.475 --> 14:13.187
You could be so good if you just tried.

14:13.187 --> 14:15.772
No, Gordon. Why?
Why don't you try?

14:15.772 --> 14:17.524
Wait, wait, you have so much potential.

14:18.066 --> 14:20.277
What are you?
My fourth grade teacher now?

14:20.277 --> 14:21.445
Gordon, I mean it.

14:22.779 --> 14:25.866
You are better than
that genius in the basement.

14:27.618 --> 14:29.119
Very nice of you to say.

14:30.078 --> 14:31.163
Thank you.

14:39.588 --> 14:42.216
I think that's the guy
who invented fire.

14:43.592 --> 14:45.052
'Cause he's not young.

14:47.763 --> 14:49.097
Who's daddy's little girl?

14:49.097 --> 14:50.057
You are.

14:50.057 --> 14:52.267
Yes, you are. That's right!

14:53.352 --> 14:55.771
Well, I have to admit.

14:55.771 --> 14:58.482
I haven't seen her this happy
in a really long time.

14:58.482 --> 15:01.610
Oh, do you wanna cuddle
with your Aunt Hannah?

15:01.610 --> 15:04.655
You know, I really don't
think that's necessary.

15:04.655 --> 15:06.907
Oh, she's got kisses to spare.

15:06.907 --> 15:08.408
Just don't kiss her straight on the mouth,

15:08.408 --> 15:10.118
because sometimes she spits up a little.

15:10.118 --> 15:12.287
Oh, well. God, self-control initiate.

15:15.165 --> 15:16.124
Ah...

15:18.961 --> 15:21.547
What happened to us, Zack?

15:21.547 --> 15:25.175
Well, you got jealous of
every woman I worked with,

15:25.175 --> 15:27.010
and I like working with
women who aren't scared

15:27.010 --> 15:28.095
of my girlfriend.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.013
Yeah. I guess that wasn't cool of me.

15:30.013 --> 15:31.640
I've grown up a lot since then.

15:31.640 --> 15:32.933
Ahh!

15:32.933 --> 15:34.560
Maybe we just weren't
right for each other.

15:34.560 --> 15:37.062
- How can you say that?
- We're totally different.

15:37.062 --> 15:39.690
I'm an early riser,
you stay up late at night.

15:39.690 --> 15:41.358
I like watching <i>Rick and Morty,</i>

15:41.358 --> 15:43.151
you like watching things
that aren't <i>Rick and Morty.</i>

15:44.528 --> 15:46.947
Okay. We can share custody.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.365
You can take her half the week,

15:48.365 --> 15:50.450
and we can trade off
on holidays and weekends.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.577
I get Halloween.

15:51.577 --> 15:52.828
Cool.

15:52.828 --> 15:54.913
You can take her tonight if you want.

15:54.913 --> 15:56.999
Really? Oh, sick.

15:56.999 --> 15:59.209
Hannah said that she can watch her
while I'm at rehearsal.

15:59.209 --> 16:00.752
I did say that. Yeah.

16:01.378 --> 16:03.589
Hey, Marcy,
I just want you to know,

16:03.589 --> 16:05.382
that I don't regret you and me.

16:05.382 --> 16:07.467
Because something really
good came out of us.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.927
This little ray of sunshine.

16:10.929 --> 16:11.847
Oh.

16:11.847 --> 16:15.058
I think something just came out
of this little ray of sunshine.

16:15.058 --> 16:16.393
Aw.

16:21.899 --> 16:24.109
Where are we?

16:24.109 --> 16:26.320
Look, I don't have time
to take you home first.

16:26.320 --> 16:27.779
So just sit here,

16:27.779 --> 16:30.657
and look at all the pretty
water bottles and shit.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.618
What is this? Your whore's house?

16:32.618 --> 16:33.911
Your crack den?

16:33.911 --> 16:34.953
Oh, do you really wanna play

16:34.953 --> 16:37.331
the drug card right now, duchess?

16:37.331 --> 16:39.666
Now this is not a great neighborhood.

16:39.666 --> 16:42.294
So just lock the doors and sit.

16:42.294 --> 16:43.879
Do you understand?

16:43.879 --> 16:46.256
You are a bad seed, Clay Barber.

16:46.256 --> 16:47.758
A bad seed.

16:48.926 --> 16:49.885
Stay.

16:54.348 --> 16:55.349
Oh my God.

17:07.277 --> 17:08.403
Ugh!

17:35.222 --> 17:37.432
Thank you for sharing with us, Janice.

17:37.432 --> 17:38.350
Keep coming back.

17:39.184 --> 17:42.020
So, is anyone celebrating today?

17:45.190 --> 17:46.817
Hello. My name is Clay.

17:46.817 --> 17:48.193
Hi, Clay.

17:48.193 --> 17:51.113
I'm an alcoholic and I'm
celebrating 30 days sober.

17:56.159 --> 17:57.202
Hello.

17:58.287 --> 18:00.789
This is an AA meeting.

18:01.331 --> 18:03.250
That's right, love.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.751
Come on in, take a seat.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.128
That's not necessary. She was just--

18:06.128 --> 18:07.963
My name is Bree.

18:07.963 --> 18:09.173
Hi Bree.

18:09.173 --> 18:12.050
- Please don't.
- And I'm on mushrooms.

18:13.343 --> 18:14.595
Okay, so--

18:14.595 --> 18:17.055
What is the one thing you don't wanna hear

18:17.055 --> 18:19.141
after blowing Willie Nelson?

18:19.141 --> 18:20.893
What?

18:20.893 --> 18:22.186
I'm not Willie Nelson.

18:23.896 --> 18:26.690
- Okay. Yeah.
- Is that, is that good? Is that good?

18:26.690 --> 18:29.026
Look at that. Look at that!

18:29.026 --> 18:30.694
Chuck Lorre gets a star

18:30.694 --> 18:32.487
on the Hollywood walk of fame.

18:32.487 --> 18:33.906
How is that possible?

18:33.906 --> 18:35.407
Holy sh--
You know,

18:36.033 --> 18:38.202
maybe like 10 years ago.

18:38.202 --> 18:40.871
I finally get the nerve
to do another pilot.

18:40.871 --> 18:42.998
Network passes.

18:42.998 --> 18:46.126
Why? 'Cause they had to
put three new Chuck Lorre

18:46.126 --> 18:49.254
shows on the air to go
with his 11 other shows.

18:49.254 --> 18:51.215
- Oh, fuck that guy.
- Right?

18:51.215 --> 18:53.592
No, you, you should have a star.

18:53.842 --> 18:55.677
- Yes.
- I mean, you know.

18:55.677 --> 18:58.263
Let me, let me say this to Chuck Lorre.

18:58.263 --> 18:59.389
What are you doing?

18:59.389 --> 19:01.558
I'm gonna piss on Chuck Lorre's star.

19:01.558 --> 19:04.353
- No, wait, Gordon, no.
- No, I need to do this.

19:04.353 --> 19:06.021
- You can't do this.
- I hate this guy.

19:06.021 --> 19:08.440
I hate this guy. Don't try and stop me.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.817
- I'm not gonna.
- No.

19:10.817 --> 19:11.944
Give a minute.

19:14.696 --> 19:15.697
I can't pee.

19:17.157 --> 19:18.242
Hey.

19:18.242 --> 19:21.078
Hey, I'll do it for you.

19:22.371 --> 19:23.914
Seriously?

19:23.914 --> 19:24.748
Yep.

19:25.707 --> 19:26.542
What a guy.

19:27.668 --> 19:29.044
Go ahead.

19:29.044 --> 19:30.254
But do it fast.

19:33.423 --> 19:36.051
Jesus. That's a powerful
stream you got there.

19:36.593 --> 19:40.305
You power wash graffiti
on the weekends with that?

19:40.305 --> 19:43.225
For, you my friend,
it is the least I can do.

19:43.976 --> 19:45.519
No!

19:47.688 --> 19:49.523
Okay. Just peed a little.

19:58.115 --> 19:58.949
Hey.

20:00.325 --> 20:01.869
Hey!

20:01.869 --> 20:03.620
How you feeling this morning?

20:03.620 --> 20:05.038
Really, just...

20:05.914 --> 20:07.457
chipper.

20:07.457 --> 20:09.668
Thanks for coming to get me last night.

20:09.668 --> 20:11.503
No problem. Uh, and next time

20:11.503 --> 20:12.754
you wanna do drugs in the woods,

20:12.754 --> 20:14.673
I know some guys
who will do that for free.

20:14.673 --> 20:16.216
I'm sure you do.

20:16.216 --> 20:19.845
Uh, I also wanted to say
that I think it's really,

20:19.845 --> 20:22.723
it's great what you're
doing with the meetings.

20:22.723 --> 20:25.017
Oh yeah. Well, we got
a second chance here.

20:25.017 --> 20:26.185
Just trying not to blow it.

20:26.185 --> 20:27.477
But don't tell anyone,

20:27.477 --> 20:29.188
I have a bad reputation to protect.

20:29.188 --> 20:30.731
Okay.

20:30.731 --> 20:33.650
I'm glad you're exploring
or whatever you want to call it.

20:33.650 --> 20:35.360
'Cause you used to be so uptight.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.821
- I wasn't uptight.
- Okay.

20:37.821 --> 20:41.325
Vain, narcissistic, prone to meltdowns,
bad at driving.

20:41.325 --> 20:43.035
Fake nice to waiters in a way that shows

20:43.035 --> 20:44.578
you think you're better than them.

20:44.578 --> 20:45.704
Uptight is fine.

20:47.706 --> 20:50.042
It's funny. I needed to
stop getting loaded

20:50.042 --> 20:52.419
and you needed to start.

20:52.419 --> 20:55.839
Who knows? Fifteen years ago,
if I'd had seen this side of you,

20:55.839 --> 20:58.717
maybe I'd have tried
to get in there myself.

20:58.717 --> 21:00.260
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

21:00.260 --> 21:02.596
Well, 15 years ago, if I was on drugs,

21:02.596 --> 21:03.972
I might have let you.
- Heh.

21:09.853 --> 21:11.188
Oh.

21:12.523 --> 21:14.107
Hey, you.

21:14.107 --> 21:16.777
That was quite a cute move
you pulled last night.

21:16.777 --> 21:17.945
Sorry about that.

21:17.945 --> 21:20.864
And I think you're right about
getting involved in the actors' lives.

21:20.864 --> 21:23.075
No, it was actually really good.

21:23.075 --> 21:25.869
We drank and we talked and, you know,

21:25.869 --> 21:27.829
we said some things
that needed to be said.

21:27.829 --> 21:29.706
Oh, I'm glad to hear that.

21:29.706 --> 21:31.041
Yeah, so.

21:31.041 --> 21:33.377
Oh, also we promised
a cop a part in the show.

21:34.419 --> 21:36.296
- I won't ask.
- Yeah.

21:36.296 --> 21:39.091
By the way,
I love that restaurant.

21:39.091 --> 21:42.386
Maybe, you and I could
go some time for real,

21:42.386 --> 21:43.929
and have a couple of drinks.

21:45.305 --> 21:46.890
I don't know.

21:46.890 --> 21:48.600
Getting involved in showrunners' lives.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.394
They're just, they're
a bottomless pit of need.

21:50.394 --> 21:51.728
Call back, it's cute.

21:51.728 --> 21:53.689
All right. Everybody already in there?

21:53.689 --> 21:54.982
- Yeah.
- Okay. I'll be right in.

21:55.357 --> 21:56.525
Hannah.

21:56.525 --> 21:58.527
I'm Hugo. One of the grips.
- Yeah.

21:58.527 --> 21:59.903
Zack was telling me you're good at

21:59.903 --> 22:01.572
helping people with their problems.

22:01.572 --> 22:03.115
- Oh.
- You see,

22:03.115 --> 22:05.158
my wife just left me
'cause I bought a jet ski

22:05.158 --> 22:06.118
without telling her.

22:07.286 --> 22:08.537
I'm sorry to hear that.

22:08.537 --> 22:12.165
Um, let's talk in my office.

22:12.165 --> 22:13.458
Oh, sure. Yeah.

22:17.504 --> 22:18.881
Or some place else.
