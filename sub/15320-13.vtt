00:20.771 --> 00:23.103
No, actually I’m not.

00:23.107 --> 00:26.099
Orpheus was a Greek poet
and musician.

00:26.110 --> 00:28.317
His music could entrance.

00:29.614 --> 00:34.074
He descended into hell to rescue his wife,
and his song won back her soul.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.907
But there was a condition:
He couldn’t look back...

00:38.915 --> 00:43.079
as he led her out of the underworld,
or she would be damned.

00:44.712 --> 00:47.749
Let me guess. Things didn’t work out.

01:18.412 --> 01:22.155
Orpheus sounds like
the story of Lot in the Bible.

01:23.292 --> 01:25.749
His wife turned into a pillar of salt.

01:25.753 --> 01:28.119

to Rosie through Beau Soleil

at the phone records...

another crack at the hooker site.

on him in the meantime.

03:26.374 --> 03:29.411
He trades his personal car for this one
at the campaign parking lot.

He takes the ferry to the casino
to meet Rosie.

03:33.089 --> 03:34.954
Why did he switch cars?

03:34.965 --> 03:37.957
Maybe he knew what he was going to do.
He was planning it.

03:39.637 --> 03:42.754
So why’d he switch to a car
that could be traced back
to the campaign?

So?

06:28.389 --> 06:30.095
It’s nearly full now.

06:31.809 --> 06:33.765
Meaning
he filled it up.

06:34.728 --> 06:38.812
He must’ve stopped
at a gas station on the way
to the ferry or on the way back.

06:38.816 --> 06:40.977
He could’ve used
a credit card
to pay for the gas...

06:40.985 --> 06:43.397
and maybe a security camera
got him on tape.

10:11.195 --> 10:14.107

to the ferry,

10:32.257 --> 10:34.669

According to the odometer,
he drove 120 miles that night.

10:39.890 --> 10:43.724
That’s a hundred miles missing.
Where did he drive to?

10:43.727 --> 10:47.891

back to the park.

Especially not with an underage girl
in the trunk of your car.

10:56.406 --> 10:59.990
So maybe he took a quiet drive
where no one would see him,
recognize him.

10:59.993 --> 11:05.078
The only other way
to or from the casino is north,

11:05.082 --> 11:07.824
past city limits, over Desolation Bridge.

11:08.001 --> 11:11.994
