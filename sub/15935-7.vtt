00:20.274 --> 00:21.677

00:21.677 --> 00:23.681
she broke your heart, and
you came back to me.

00:23.681 --> 00:25.852
Ever since you two had sex, Virginia,

00:25.852 --> 00:27.956
you have completely and
irrevocably turned on me.

00:27.956 --> 00:29.626
Could you ask Art to
come in here, please?

00:29.626 --> 00:30.895
Did we have sex, Art?

00:30.895 --> 00:33.099
Any sort of physical contact at all?

00:33.099 --> 00:34.636
We did not.

00:34.636 --> 00:36.774
Have you had sexual
experiences with men?

00:36.774 --> 00:38.811
- No.
- JOHNSON:  Boys perhaps?

00:38.811 --> 00:40.147
I mean when you were also a boy.

00:40.147 --> 00:42.719
Once, when I had just turned 16.

00:42.719 --> 00:44.590
You get out of AA what you put in.

00:44.590 --> 00:45.792
I could go to some other meeting.

00:45.792 --> 00:48.129
You will stay in my meeting.

It'll remind me of just
how far I've come.

00:51.302 --> 00:53.139
Well, what choice do we have?

00:53.139 --> 00:54.943
It's either this or nothin', right?

00:54.943 --> 00:56.847

00:56.847 --> 00:59.085

You're everything a person could want...

01:00.822 --> 01:02.626
- ...in a sperm donor.
- I would consider it.

01:02.626 --> 01:05.899
She is perfect. Congratulations.

Based on your presentation, Dr. Scully,

03:31.957 --> 03:34.462
we find you took all
necessary precautions

03:34.462 --> 03:37.535

before, during, and after delivery.

03:43.948 --> 03:46.252
From the moment Helen was
admitted to the hospital,

03:46.252 --> 03:48.256
she was concerned about spotting,

03:48.256 --> 03:49.826
problems with her vision--

03:49.826 --> 03:51.262
Well, that's why you
took her blood pressure

every 15 minutes.

03:52.498 --> 03:53.901
I should have monitored it more closely.

All vital signs were perfectly normal

03:55.905 --> 03:57.307
until after delivery.

03:57.307 --> 03:59.479
I didn't see the warning signs.

03:59.479 --> 04:00.915
There were no warning signs.

04:00.915 --> 04:03.119
There was nothing you could have done.

04:03.119 --> 04:05.591
Barton, this isn't the
first time you and I

04:05.591 --> 04:08.464
have sat in that room.

04:08.464 --> 04:10.401
The patient was 31 weeks pregnant.

04:10.401 --> 04:12.137
She presented with bleeding and cramps.

04:12.137 --> 04:15.110
I did an exam; I recognized the
placental abruption immediately.

04:15.110 --> 04:16.980
By the time she was
rushed into hospital,

04:16.980 --> 04:18.983
the baby had stopped moving.

04:18.983 --> 04:20.421
The hemorrhaging got worse.

04:20.421 --> 04:23.794
Two hours later, the patient was dead.

04:23.794 --> 04:26.332
You handed me your
resignation the next day.

04:26.332 --> 04:27.635
And you refused to accept it,

04:27.635 --> 04:30.340
because I'd been proven innocent.

04:30.340 --> 04:31.944
Yet after all these years,

04:31.944 --> 04:34.950
there is a part of me that
still isn't convinced.

04:36.820 --> 04:39.091
I don't know how to forgive myself.

04:43.801 --> 04:46.440
I'm just going to be direct about this.

04:47.875 --> 04:49.512
The only way you're gonna get that out

04:49.512 --> 04:52.452
is with vinegar and baking soda.

04:52.452 --> 04:54.321
- Oh, shit.
- Actually,

04:54.321 --> 04:57.327
there's something else that I
wanted to discuss with you.

04:59.164 --> 05:01.837
You know, obviously, things
have been a bit strained

05:01.837 --> 05:03.640
between us these past few weeks,

05:03.640 --> 05:06.780
and obviously, if you had
told Nancy the truth

05:06.780 --> 05:08.082
about our night together

05:08.082 --> 05:09.753
instead of lying to her and to me,

05:09.753 --> 05:11.456
all of this unpleasantness

05:11.456 --> 05:13.292
could have been avoided.

05:13.292 --> 05:17.034
It did create something of a rift

05:17.034 --> 05:18.437
between me and Nancy.

05:18.437 --> 05:21.443
Well, I may be able to help with that.

05:21.443 --> 05:25.183
From now on, you and Nancy
should be partnered.

05:25.183 --> 05:26.653
Working side by side,

05:26.653 --> 05:28.524
sharing your passion for the work,

05:28.524 --> 05:29.859

05:29.859 --> 05:32.164

05:32.164 --> 05:35.471
Thank you for thinking of us.

05:35.471 --> 05:38.042
I'm guessing that means you'd
be partnered again with Bill?

05:38.042 --> 05:40.213
Well, it would logically follow.

05:40.213 --> 05:42.050
And have you seen him with Nancy lately?

05:42.050 --> 05:44.422
Some days, I worry she actually
has become his shadow.

05:44.422 --> 05:46.158
I wouldn't worry yourself
about that, Art.

the day-to-day work together.

07:23.754 --> 07:26.559

before Art accused me

07:26.559 --> 07:29.799

As an adolescent.

10:43.887 --> 10:46.526
He now claims to be
entirely heterosexual.

10:46.526 --> 10:49.030
Hmm, no one is entirely anything.

10:49.030 --> 10:51.101
The Kinsey scale taught me that.

10:53.707 --> 10:55.176
We haven't used the Kinsey scale

10:55.176 --> 10:56.546
much in our work.

10:56.546 --> 10:59.350
Well, I found it to be a
useful diagnostic tool

10:59.350 --> 11:00.921
at the Institute.

11:00.921 --> 11:02.791
The scale helps the patient understand

11:02.791 --> 11:06.198
that sexuality isn't binary; it's fluid.

11:06.198 --> 11:09.170
Truth is, none of us is just one thing.

11:09.170 --> 11:11.374
- Hmm.
- ART:  We're many things.

11:11.374 --> 11:14.147
All at once.

11:14.147 --> 11:18.021
Maybe you should conduct your
own intake with Mr. Drag.

11:18.021 --> 11:20.994
But you and Mrs. Johnson already have.

11:20.994 --> 11:23.600
But your expertise may lead
to a different conclusion.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.672
No, I-I-I think your perspective

11:26.672 --> 11:28.743
could be quite useful in this case.

11:30.045 --> 11:31.883
BETTY: I said I didn't want pizza.

11:31.883 --> 11:34.955
No, you said you didn't
want to go out for pizza.

11:34.955 --> 11:37.795
But it turns out,

11:37.795 --> 11:39.532
pizza travels now.

11:41.536 --> 11:43.305
I heard on good authority

11:43.305 --> 11:46.311
that you're not eating much.

11:46.311 --> 11:48.883
Or at all.

11:48.883 --> 11:50.887
That there are mountains of...

11:50.887 --> 11:54.728
uneaten casseroles in your refrigerator.

11:54.728 --> 11:56.566
Yeah, they keep droppin' 'em off.

11:56.566 --> 11:58.135
Which is strange,

11:58.135 --> 12:00.607
because between Virginia,
Barton, and Lester,

12:00.607 --> 12:02.444
there's not a cook in the bunch.

12:02.444 --> 12:05.349
Well, Guy's been cooking up a storm.

12:07.454 --> 12:09.758
(EXHALES) People are worried, Betty.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.204
You wanna drink?

12:16.204 --> 12:19.612
Turns out, shock wears off after--

12:19.612 --> 12:22.951
I don't know-- however long it's been.

12:22.951 --> 12:24.455
Thirteen days. (SIGHS)

12:24.455 --> 12:26.425
And once it's gone,

12:26.425 --> 12:30.800
oh, dear God, what's left is so...

12:30.800 --> 12:32.738
(EXHALES) I feel like

12:32.738 --> 12:35.510
a rabbit at the dog track
running around and around

12:35.510 --> 12:37.414
just terrified, confused, exhausted,

12:37.414 --> 12:38.816
and I keep...

12:38.816 --> 12:40.654
I keep turning to Helen

12:40.654 --> 12:43.292
to say, "What happened?"

12:43.292 --> 12:47.668
I turn to her a hundred times a day.

12:47.668 --> 12:51.107
God, I screwed up

12:51.107 --> 12:54.280
so many things in my life.

12:54.280 --> 12:57.186
But Helen was...

12:57.186 --> 12:59.792
the one thing I got right.

12:59.792 --> 13:01.896
We got each other right.

13:01.896 --> 13:03.833
Not that everything was all daffodils,

13:03.833 --> 13:07.574
but there was never a sliver of a doubt

13:07.574 --> 13:10.179
that...

13:10.179 --> 13:11.983
that we really loved each other.

13:11.983 --> 13:14.020
Because...

13:14.020 --> 13:16.959
we really did.

13:16.959 --> 13:18.463
Sometimes things are so right,

13:18.463 --> 13:20.967
you don't even think to question them.

13:23.005 --> 13:26.679
I suppose that's true.

13:26.679 --> 13:28.148
I wouldn't know.

13:30.720 --> 13:33.058
Never?

13:33.058 --> 13:37.534
You never had a time when
everything was just right?

13:37.534 --> 13:39.571
You know, in love, I mean.

13:40.807 --> 13:43.746
There was a girl...

13:43.746 --> 13:45.249
long ago.

13:45.249 --> 13:47.053
When I was still in school.

13:49.257 --> 13:51.361
Her name was Dody.

13:53.599 --> 13:56.872
And, um...

13:56.872 --> 13:58.208
(EXHALES SLOWLY)

13:58.208 --> 14:00.179
And when I met her...

14:02.484 --> 14:05.557
...suddenly I had this feeling like...

14:07.026 --> 14:08.629
...I could breathe

14:08.629 --> 14:11.802
or, um....

14:11.802 --> 14:14.641
like I was myself,

14:14.641 --> 14:15.910
finally.

14:19.217 --> 14:21.387
(SCOFFS) I don't know
why I'm saying this.

14:21.387 --> 14:23.225

- Please.

14:23.225 --> 14:25.262
I want you to.

14:25.262 --> 14:26.732
Okay.

14:26.732 --> 14:30.406
(CLEARS THROAT) Well, um...

14:30.406 --> 14:32.711
one day,

14:32.711 --> 14:34.213
Dody was at the hospital,

14:34.213 --> 14:36.852
just simple appendicitis,

14:36.852 --> 14:40.092
and so I left her some roses

14:40.092 --> 14:43.733
and a note for her,

14:43.733 --> 14:46.070
and in the note,

14:46.070 --> 14:48.643
I asked her to marry me.

14:52.784 --> 14:55.456
So I went over to the
hospital to pick her up,

14:55.456 --> 14:58.729
and I-I was literally floating on air.

14:59.965 --> 15:02.369

15:12.524 --> 15:14.561
...she was ice cold.

15:16.732 --> 15:18.736
She didn't say anything to me.

15:18.736 --> 15:20.707
Didn't mention my proposal.

17:43.592 --> 17:45.930
Are you taking notes, Mr. Fleming?

17:45.930 --> 17:47.600
Is that a problem?

17:47.600 --> 17:49.303
It's just, we take the notes

17:49.303 --> 17:50.907
so you can concentrate on telling us

17:50.907 --> 17:52.142
about what brings you here.

17:52.142 --> 17:54.380
He just does it to calm his anxiety.

17:54.380 --> 17:56.718
His therapist gave it to
him as a coping mechanism.

17:56.718 --> 17:58.154
There's certainly no reason

17:58.154 --> 18:00.158
for you to be nervous, Mr. Fleming,

18:00.158 --> 18:02.362

I think, in this case, we
can make an exception.

18:05.670 --> 18:07.205
All right, then.

18:07.205 --> 18:09.544
Uh, in terms of the pain, Mrs. Fleming,

18:09.544 --> 18:11.347
how would you describe the sensation?

18:11.347 --> 18:14.888
It's like my vagina is seizing up.

18:14.888 --> 18:16.357
Almost like...

18:30.953 --> 18:33.324
the technical definition
of myotonia, Mr. Fleming?

18:33.324 --> 18:35.796
An inability to relax the muscle?

18:35.796 --> 18:38.936
Hmm, that's very impressive.

18:38.936 --> 18:41.273
I wouldn't expect a bank manager

21:28.341 --> 21:31.046
Sex thera-- we want
to be sex therapists.

21:31.046 --> 21:33.552
We want to open our own clinic.

21:33.552 --> 21:35.723
Shame on you for lying.

21:35.723 --> 21:37.526
No, please, take it as a compliment.

21:37.526 --> 21:39.998
We are so impressed by your work.

21:39.998 --> 21:42.403
We're just trying to do as
much research as possible,

21:42.403 --> 21:43.805
see how other therapists do it.

21:43.805 --> 21:46.343
And you are by far the best,

21:46.343 --> 21:48.147
although we are talking
to all the others.

21:48.147 --> 21:49.984
What others?

21:49.984 --> 21:51.988
MASTERS: Broken vertebrae.
How did this happen?

21:51.988 --> 21:55.061
We left this bar about three years ago

21:55.061 --> 21:57.833
on his birthday.

21:57.833 --> 22:00.606
I was drunk, but he was drunker,

22:00.606 --> 22:03.845
so I said, "Give me the keys," right?

22:03.845 --> 22:05.716
And the last thing I remember

22:05.716 --> 22:08.855
was the radio playing "Hang On Sloopy"

22:08.855 --> 22:11.326
when we pulled out the parkin' lot.

22:11.326 --> 22:14.967
The next thing I remember is waking up

22:14.967 --> 22:18.875
with a tracheal tube
down my throat in ICU

22:18.875 --> 22:21.681
and finding out that James--

22:21.681 --> 22:25.422
that my husband was paralyzed
from the waist down.

22:25.422 --> 22:27.993
A-and I know that AA is anonymous,

22:27.993 --> 22:30.164
but I knew when you came into my meeting

22:30.164 --> 22:32.403
that you were that famous sex guru.

22:32.403 --> 22:35.274
I'm hardly a "sex guru," Louise,

22:35.274 --> 22:39.082
and I--this is hardly
my area of expertise.

22:39.082 --> 22:42.122
Right, but you specialize
in sexual dysfunction,

22:42.122 --> 22:46.531
and sometimes he can get it
up and sometimes he can't,

22:46.531 --> 22:50.037
and I was just hopin' you
could explain all this to me.

22:52.308 --> 22:53.778
(CLEARS THROAT)

22:53.778 --> 22:57.051
Well, um...

22:57.051 --> 22:59.423
looking at your husband's X-rays,

22:59.423 --> 23:02.730
there's broken vertebrae
on the S4 and the S5.

23:02.730 --> 23:04.867
His injury appears to be partial,

23:04.867 --> 23:07.540
which means there's some
kind of neural connection,

23:07.540 --> 23:10.746
but it's probably haphazard, so...

23:10.746 --> 23:13.852
he can have erections, but
they can't be controlled

23:13.852 --> 23:15.923
through thinking sexual thoughts

23:15.923 --> 23:17.760
or, uh...

23:17.760 --> 23:20.465
manual stimulation.

23:20.465 --> 23:22.068
Does that sound about right?

23:22.068 --> 23:24.072
Well, as for touching him

23:24.072 --> 23:26.243
in a sexual way,

23:26.243 --> 23:29.450
we haven't tried that
since the accident.

23:29.450 --> 23:31.721
James hasn't...

23:31.721 --> 23:34.961
He hasn't been interested,
I guess is the word.

23:34.961 --> 23:37.433
This has been a very
difficult transition

23:37.433 --> 23:39.302
for him--for both of us.

23:39.302 --> 23:41.941
He feels nothin' down there, so...

23:43.912 --> 23:45.916
So...

23:45.916 --> 23:49.022
you're actually here for
more than an explanation.

23:49.022 --> 23:51.126
Well, I did read up on you,

23:51.126 --> 23:54.700
and I know that you're not one
to back down from a challenge,

23:54.700 --> 23:56.771
so I suppose what I'm askin'--

23:56.771 --> 24:00.612
really, begging-- you for is...

24:00.612 --> 24:02.416
some kind of hope.

24:05.789 --> 24:07.292
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

24:07.292 --> 24:08.428
(CLEARS THROAT)

24:09.830 --> 24:11.434
It's very hard to know

24:11.434 --> 24:14.774
what kind of sexual response
will be possible with James,

24:14.774 --> 24:18.648
but the goal in any case like this

24:18.648 --> 24:22.456
would be to experiment
with neural rewiring.

24:22.456 --> 24:24.660
Now, I know this is a
very new area of science,

24:24.660 --> 24:27.499
but it would involve mapping
your husband's dermatomes--

24:27.499 --> 24:30.439
um, areas on his skin that correspond

24:30.439 --> 24:32.976
with certain spinal nerves--

24:32.976 --> 24:35.114
and then stimulating them

24:35.114 --> 24:37.018
to try and generate erotic feeling

24:37.018 --> 24:39.222
that could lead to an erection.

24:39.222 --> 24:40.859
Now, like I say, this is all very new,

24:40.859 --> 24:44.800
but sometimes mapping can help us

24:44.800 --> 24:47.138
to see where he feels sexual arousal

24:47.138 --> 24:49.075
in places aside from genitals

24:49.075 --> 24:50.846
and then how it can be reconnected

24:50.846 --> 24:51.981
back to his genitals.

24:51.981 --> 24:53.183
Well, okay, well,

24:53.183 --> 24:54.587
that-that-that's a start, right?

24:54.587 --> 24:55.756
(EXHALES)

24:55.756 --> 24:57.659
What it is, is highly experimental.

24:57.659 --> 25:00.499
I-I-I've never taken a case like this.

25:00.499 --> 25:03.872
And the process would not
be for the faint of heart.

25:03.872 --> 25:06.042
Plus there's no promise

25:06.042 --> 25:07.479
that this would work.

25:09.483 --> 25:11.186
But mostly, it would require

25:11.186 --> 25:14.025
complete openness and
honesty from you both,

25:14.025 --> 25:16.798
and I suspect it'd make
you and your husband

25:16.798 --> 25:18.668
feel very exposed.

25:18.668 --> 25:20.705
Dr. Masters, I can...

25:20.705 --> 25:23.511
I can assure you that I've
never felt more exposed

25:23.511 --> 25:25.749
in my life.

25:29.490 --> 25:31.861
Three other clinics in the greater St.
Louis area alone.

25:31.861 --> 25:33.932
Two promise to eliminate
sexual dysfunction

25:33.932 --> 25:36.169
in a single session.

25:36.169 --> 25:38.040
I ran into one of these
quacks myself in Las Vegas.

25:38.040 --> 25:39.710
Look, if you're worried
about competition--

25:39.710 --> 25:42.549
We'd be idiots not to
worry about competition,

25:42.549 --> 25:43.785
but, more importantly,

25:43.785 --> 25:45.889
we have charlatans coming in here

25:45.889 --> 25:49.295
posing as patients, people
I very easily convinced

25:49.295 --> 25:52.469
that electroshock therapy
was standard treatment.

25:55.809 --> 25:57.579
It's a symposium tomorrow

25:57.579 --> 25:58.948
happening right outside the city.

25:58.948 --> 26:00.150
"The Joys of Partnering."

26:00.150 --> 26:01.754
It's a seminar for singles,

26:01.754 --> 26:03.390
but one of the topics in the pamphlet

26:03.390 --> 26:04.994
is sexual dysfunction.

26:04.994 --> 26:08.000
That doesn't necessarily
sound irresponsible,

26:08.000 --> 26:09.904
and we didn't invent sexual dysfunction,

26:09.904 --> 26:12.543
so there's no indication that
they're stealing our work.

26:12.543 --> 26:15.749
Yes, but we are just coming out
from under a legal nightmare

26:15.749 --> 26:18.922
based on the misunderstanding
of our methods.

26:18.922 --> 26:22.361
The last thing we need are
frauds in our very field

26:22.361 --> 26:26.102
potentially spreading dangerous
interpretations of our ideas.

26:26.102 --> 26:27.773
You're right.

26:27.773 --> 26:29.309
You should go.

26:29.309 --> 26:30.712
Take Nancy with you and report back.

26:30.712 --> 26:31.881

- Well, Art and I are still

26:31.881 --> 26:33.083
sorting out working together,

26:33.083 --> 26:34.720
- as are you and Nancy.
- Fine, then.

26:34.720 --> 26:36.824
But, Bill, at a certain point,

26:36.824 --> 26:38.628
it's just negligence

26:38.628 --> 26:42.168
if you refuse to stand with me
and defend what we do here.

26:48.347 --> 26:50.919
Now, before Dr. Kinsey
began his research,

26:50.919 --> 26:53.591
most scientists were accustomed
to thinking of sexuality

26:53.591 --> 26:55.595
as a dichotomy.

26:55.595 --> 26:57.432
Right? Two choices.

26:57.432 --> 27:01.306
An individual either checks
this box, heterosexual,

27:01.306 --> 27:03.978
or this box, homosexual.

27:03.978 --> 27:05.548
What Dr. Kinsey discovered, however,

27:05.548 --> 27:08.488
was, the vast majority of people

27:08.488 --> 27:11.059
found themselves somewhere in between.

27:11.059 --> 27:12.562
- In between?
- Right.

27:12.562 --> 27:14.600
Now, according to the Kinsey scale,

27:14.600 --> 27:16.604
someone that is exclusively heterosexual

27:16.604 --> 27:18.441
would be a zero.

27:18.441 --> 27:21.179
Someone that is exclusively homosexual,

27:21.179 --> 27:23.083
on the other hand, we would label a six.

27:23.083 --> 27:25.989
But how would you measure someone?

27:25.989 --> 27:27.693
We make a calculation

27:27.693 --> 27:29.930
based on the number of
homosexual experiences

27:29.930 --> 27:31.166
an individual has had,

27:31.166 --> 27:33.538
as well as the frequency with which

27:33.538 --> 27:35.140
the individual continues

27:35.140 --> 27:38.648
to desire or fantasize
about same-sex partners.

27:38.648 --> 27:40.885
BARTON: I'm not sure why
you're pointing this out to me.

27:40.885 --> 27:43.056
'Cause I am desperate to
believe that what I am seeing

27:43.056 --> 27:44.793
is not what really is.

Well, I don't have time for riddles.

27:48.133 --> 27:50.204
from a homosexual to a heterosexual.

BARTON: That's hogwash.

27:51.574 --> 27:53.243
GUY: I thought this
clinic was the last place

27:53.243 --> 27:55.314
that something like conversion
therapy would happen.

27:55.314 --> 27:57.586
(GRUNTS) It's not happening.

28:00.257 --> 28:02.863
In your intake, you brought up

28:02.863 --> 28:05.468
a homosexual experience
you had as a young man

28:05.468 --> 28:07.839
- with a schoolmate.
- Where does that put me?

28:07.839 --> 28:10.845
Well, based on the fact that you
continue to think about it--

28:10.845 --> 28:12.014
Involuntarily.

28:12.014 --> 28:15.187
Let's say three.

28:15.187 --> 28:16.690
So right in the middle.

28:16.690 --> 28:19.162
Nearly 12% of the men Dr.
Kinsey interviewed

28:19.162 --> 28:21.500
in his initial research
were also threes.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.471
- That's more than one in ten.
- That's right.

28:23.471 --> 28:25.174
And have you ever seen a three

28:25.174 --> 28:27.913
go on to get married, have children,

28:27.913 --> 28:30.919
lead, you know, a normal kind of life?

28:32.054 --> 28:33.758
Of course.

28:33.758 --> 28:36.597

29:10.565 --> 29:13.003
In a movie theater.

29:13.003 --> 29:14.940
Did you masturbate him,

29:14.940 --> 29:17.177
or did you perform oral sex?

29:19.583 --> 29:21.420
Both.

29:21.420 --> 29:25.193
But it's the only time
it happened, I swear.

29:25.193 --> 29:28.434
I felt so disgusted after.

29:28.434 --> 29:29.970
I tossed the clothes I was wearing

29:29.970 --> 29:32.374
down the garbage chute
as soon as I got home.

29:38.988 --> 29:42.328
my impotence began at the same time.

29:42.328 --> 29:45.334
Now, the way you felt

about that man,

the intensity of the attraction,

how does it compare to

love, it's hearts, minds.

30:03.303 --> 30:05.307

30:05.307 --> 30:08.447
just an emotional exercise.

51:50.616 --> 51:53.153
although apparently is also a doctor?

51:55.692 --> 51:59.165
Do you know a Dr. Austin Langham?

52:06.146 --> 52:07.616
Helen didn't get pregnant

52:07.616 --> 52:10.121
by a traveling salesman
passin' through town.

52:10.121 --> 52:13.695
She only told you that because
she didn't wanna upset you

52:13.695 --> 52:15.432
with the truth.

52:15.432 --> 52:18.638
A little too late for that.

52:18.638 --> 52:21.778
Okay, then.

52:21.778 --> 52:24.382
I know Dr. Langham through work,

52:24.382 --> 52:26.554
yes.

52:26.554 --> 52:29.727
And Helen and I decided together

52:29.727 --> 52:33.868
that he would be the father of <i>our</i> baby.

52:33.868 --> 52:36.206
He has many fine qualities.

52:36.206 --> 52:39.647
Our daughter had a whole life
that was hidden from us.

52:39.647 --> 52:43.020
This bizarre existence of yours.

52:43.020 --> 52:45.859
It turns out, our daughter
was someone we barely knew.

52:47.261 --> 52:49.500
That's not...

52:49.500 --> 52:50.836
that's not true.

52:52.539 --> 52:54.410
The fact that Helen loved me

52:54.410 --> 52:57.783
doesn't change who she was...

52:57.783 --> 52:59.887
and how much she loved you.

52:59.887 --> 53:01.557
She was my daughter.

53:01.557 --> 53:04.864
(QUIETLY) I know.

53:04.864 --> 53:08.370
And now there's a baby to think about,

53:08.370 --> 53:11.042
and...

53:11.042 --> 53:13.915
maybe we can come together,

53:13.915 --> 53:15.886
out of our love for Helen

53:15.886 --> 53:17.689
and out of our love
for that little baby.

53:17.689 --> 53:21.062
Do not get near that baby.

53:21.062 --> 53:23.200
You are unfit to raise a child.

53:23.200 --> 53:25.539
You know nothing of being a mother,

53:25.539 --> 53:27.375
you live an aberrant life,

53:27.375 --> 53:28.711
you're alone,

53:28.711 --> 53:31.784
and that strip-club owner is a joke.

53:31.784 --> 53:33.421
Do the right thing...

53:33.421 --> 53:35.124
for once.

53:35.124 --> 53:39.098
Do not play fast and loose
with this baby's life.

53:39.098 --> 53:41.871
Stop thinking about yourself

53:41.871 --> 53:44.375
and do what's best for <i>her.</i>

MASTERS: Virginia.

54:27.930 --> 54:30.267
There's something we need to discuss.

54:30.267 --> 54:31.269
Can I come in?

54:36.447 --> 54:37.783
You seem upset.

54:37.783 --> 54:40.287
I am. Uh...

54:40.287 --> 54:41.691
scared, even.

54:41.691 --> 54:43.494
Scared? Why, did something--

54:43.494 --> 54:45.364
Something did happen.

54:45.364 --> 54:46.701
Uh, at first,

54:46.701 --> 54:50.207
I was just worried
about the competition.

54:50.207 --> 54:52.946
God knows that's out
there now, in spades.

54:52.946 --> 54:56.286
All three of those places
use our exact protocol.

54:56.286 --> 54:59.192
Exact. Down to the letter.

54:59.192 --> 55:02.331
Each patient undergoes
a detailed intake.

55:02.331 --> 55:04.402
Then they move on to sensate.

55:04.402 --> 55:06.907
Each treatment takes two weeks.
Same as ours.

55:06.907 --> 55:10.482
Apparently we supervised this
therapist's graduate work

55:10.482 --> 55:11.684
in sexology.

55:11.684 --> 55:13.454
Which brings me to the bigger problem,

55:13.454 --> 55:16.326
which yesterday made all too clear.

55:16.326 --> 55:19.365
There are hundreds, if not thousands,

55:19.365 --> 55:21.704
of suffering patients out
there seeking treatment.

55:21.704 --> 55:24.042
These are innocent people, Bill,

55:24.042 --> 55:26.714
being fed this misinformation
and outright lies.

55:26.714 --> 55:30.955
These are real marriages
on the line here, Bill.

55:30.955 --> 55:35.197
People who have been
together for 30, 40 years.

55:35.197 --> 55:37.969
Who have been through
countless ups and down.

55:37.969 --> 55:39.372
- Are you all right?
- Yes, bu--

55:39.372 --> 55:41.911
What have all the years
and years of hard work

55:41.911 --> 55:44.215
and good science been for

55:44.215 --> 55:47.221
if people can now get more
bad information than good?

55:49.192 --> 55:51.831
Well, we're leaders in this field.

55:51.831 --> 55:54.436
We could be organizing
a-a regulatory body,

55:54.436 --> 55:56.440
something to handle
oversight of therapists,

55:56.440 --> 55:58.411
- licensing, perhaps.
- And in the meantime,

55:58.411 --> 56:00.013
we can start in our own backyard,

56:00.013 --> 56:02.519
by investigating these therapists

56:02.519 --> 56:03.788
that are stealing our work.

56:03.788 --> 56:05.324
We could put 'em out of business.

56:05.324 --> 56:07.896
Exactly. Yes, we send a signal
to all of these charlatans

56:07.896 --> 56:10.367
that this type of infringement
will not be tolerated.

56:10.367 --> 56:14.008
So we go in as patients, and we document

56:14.008 --> 56:15.678
everything that's going
on in these clinics.

56:15.678 --> 56:17.716
We go in there together?

56:17.716 --> 56:20.154
No, no, actually,

56:20.154 --> 56:22.659
I would rather that we
investigate separately.

56:22.659 --> 56:25.765
We each pick a clinic, and
we divide and conquer,

56:25.765 --> 56:27.903
as we've done so often in this work.

56:27.903 --> 56:30.675
So here's one in Chicago,
Louisville, and Topeka.

56:30.675 --> 56:32.344
