WEBVTT

00:11.770 --> 00:15.197
Tonight, I drive around a field,

00:15.690 --> 00:18.037
James measures a runway,

00:18.530 --> 00:21.450
and Richard lays a cable.

00:25.570 --> 00:28.649
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:28.650 --> 00:31.409
Thank you. Hello, everybody!

00:31.410 --> 00:35.729
Hello and good evening. Thank
you so much. Thank you. Thank you.

00:35.730 --> 00:38.801
Now, as we know,

00:38.802 --> 00:42.449
James May lives in 1956.

00:42.450 --> 00:47.289
So he maintains that you can have
more fun in a small, simple car

00:47.290 --> 00:50.969
like an Austin A35
or a Wolseley Hornet, than you

00:50.970 --> 00:53.489
can in the big,
fire-spitting super-cars

00:53.490 --> 00:56.729
that Hammond and I thump round
the track every week.

00:56.730 --> 00:59.929
Yes, so we said to him, "All right,
as a special treat this week,

00:59.930 --> 01:01.569
"why don't you do the power test?

01:01.570 --> 01:04.409
"Get yourself down to the track
because we have found a car

01:04.410 --> 01:08.209
"that could have been made
specifically with you in mind."

01:08.210 --> 01:09.677
JEREMY CACKLES

01:12.890 --> 01:17.569
When I arrived at the track,
everything looked promising.

01:17.570 --> 01:19.209
That is...

01:19.210 --> 01:21.170
a Vauxhall Corsa.

01:23.570 --> 01:25.090
Ah, there's a note.

01:26.610 --> 01:28.569
It's from Pinky and Perky.

01:28.570 --> 01:32.009
"Dear James, hope you enjoy
taking this to the max.

01:32.010 --> 01:34.929
"PS, it was developed
at your most favourite place

01:34.930 --> 01:36.610
"in the whole wide world."

01:44.970 --> 01:46.170
Oh, God.

01:47.723 --> 01:50.449
This wasn't what I had in mind.

01:50.450 --> 01:53.637
But since I was here
and the camera crew were paid for,

01:54.090 --> 01:56.010
I had no choice
but to get on with it.

01:58.890 --> 02:03.010
Well, it's certainly quick.
0 to 60 in 6.5 seconds.

02:04.490 --> 02:08.008
And a top speed of
145 miles an hour.

02:08.402 --> 02:10.289
Hell, this is a Vauxhall Corsa!

02:12.850 --> 02:17.837
The engine is a beefed-up version
of the standard 1.6-litre turbo.

02:18.203 --> 02:21.369
And it's now been coupled
with a new sports exhaust,

02:21.370 --> 02:26.050
as a result of which,
it produces 202 horsepower.

02:27.250 --> 02:31.289
202 horsepower is a huge amount
put through the front wheels

02:31.290 --> 02:33.049
of a small car like this.

02:33.050 --> 02:37.409
And the results
ought to be pretty dramatic.

02:37.410 --> 02:41.729
And by dramatic, I mean, of course,
appalling in the bends.

02:41.730 --> 02:45.609
So let's see if that's true
with the aid of our senior

02:45.610 --> 02:47.969
cornering solutions consultant.

02:47.970 --> 02:50.370
TYRES SQUEAL

02:57.210 --> 03:00.409
Now, on paper,
this really ought not to work,

03:00.410 --> 03:03.209
all that power in the front wheels
should just make it

03:03.210 --> 03:07.049
plough straight on in the corners
and consume its own tyres.

03:07.050 --> 03:08.690
But actually, it doesn't.

03:10.483 --> 03:14.849
The reason for that is they've
given this car a bespoke suspension,

03:14.850 --> 03:18.729
especially set-up for this and
they've developed a clever diff,

03:18.730 --> 03:22.890
which manages the way the power
is fed to the wheels.

03:27.090 --> 03:28.490
It's good, isn't it?

03:32.530 --> 03:34.249
It's actually better than good.

03:34.250 --> 03:37.489
And I have to admit, that its time
on the Nurburgring has made this

03:37.490 --> 03:40.570
one of the best-handling
hot hatchbacks you can buy.

03:43.410 --> 03:48.289
So it was developed on a track.
And it's brilliant on a track.

03:48.290 --> 03:50.369
But on the road...

03:50.370 --> 03:52.289
Bloody hell.

03:52.290 --> 03:55.489
Well, I'm very pleased to be able
to report that my prejudices

03:55.490 --> 03:57.009
remain completely intact.

03:57.010 --> 04:00.609
When you add the word Nurburgring
to the name of a car,

04:00.610 --> 04:02.609
it's really just code for "ruined",

04:02.610 --> 04:05.689
because the ride
is absolutely rock hard.

04:05.690 --> 04:08.289
Ooh! It's ridiculous.

04:08.290 --> 04:09.409
Ooh!

04:09.410 --> 04:12.649
Car makers become obsessed
with making their cars

04:12.650 --> 04:15.329
go around this
irrelevant historic...

04:15.330 --> 04:18.409
German racetrack
as fast as possible,

04:18.410 --> 04:21.048
without realising
that they're ruining the car

04:21.050 --> 04:23.369
for those of us
who live in the real world.

04:23.370 --> 04:26.450
Ow! It's utterly hopeless.

04:30.250 --> 04:34.049
It's not just ruined,
it's expensively ruined,

04:34.050 --> 04:37.249
because this car costs £22,000.

04:37.250 --> 04:39.969
With a few options,
like leather seats and sat nav,

04:39.970 --> 04:42.410
it's over £24,000.

04:43.610 --> 04:47.610
This isn't what I meant
when I said small cars can be fun.

04:51.163 --> 04:55.729
What I meant was this -
the new Fiat Panda.

04:55.730 --> 05:00.409
It doesn't have a yobbo body kit
or a map of a track on the dash

05:00.410 --> 05:03.849
and although its engine
IS turbocharged,

05:03.850 --> 05:06.317
it's only a 0.8-litre two-cylinder

05:06.483 --> 05:10.209
that makes a modest
84 horsepower.

05:10.210 --> 05:15.650
Yet, I believe this car
is more fun than the Corsa.

05:20.210 --> 05:22.729
TYRES SQUEAL

05:22.730 --> 05:26.009
It's not actually about
how much power you have,

05:26.010 --> 05:28.969
it's about how much power
you can use.

05:28.970 --> 05:33.970
And in this, you can use pretty
much all of it, all of the time.

05:36.090 --> 05:38.162
Ahh!

05:38.163 --> 05:40.169
HE LAUGHS

05:40.170 --> 05:45.289
'Look, I like sitting 5mm above the
road in a 500 horsepower supercar

05:45.290 --> 05:46.770
'as much as anybody else.'

05:46.771 --> 05:48.569
Whee!

05:48.570 --> 05:51.649
'But skinny tyres
and a roly-poly body, that's fun.'

05:51.650 --> 05:55.129
The lack of grip means that,
more of the time,

05:55.130 --> 05:58.289
you are driving this car at the
edge, even at quite normal speeds

05:58.290 --> 06:02.290
and it's at the edge where things
become absolutely tremendous.

06:05.170 --> 06:07.089
Oh, bit of squirrelling.

06:07.090 --> 06:11.410
And as for that engine, well,
it may be tiny but it packs a punch.

06:12.890 --> 06:16.169
And it sounds just brilliant.

06:16.170 --> 06:20.249
I love that thrumming noise!
Rrrrrr!

06:20.250 --> 06:23.089
It's such a happy sound.

06:23.090 --> 06:26.289
It's a bit like a dog running round
with a frisbee in its mouth going

06:26.290 --> 06:28.410
"Come on, come on,
throw the frisbee."

06:30.850 --> 06:33.049
And the cost of this bundle of fun?

06:33.050 --> 06:35.329
Around £11,000.

06:35.330 --> 06:38.250
Half the price of the Corsa.

06:39.890 --> 06:45.250
However, there is a potential
problem with a small-engined car.

06:46.450 --> 06:49.210
Here's the Stig,
taking the Panda from 0...

06:53.410 --> 06:55.930
... to 70 and back to nought again.

06:59.890 --> 07:05.129
He did that,
according to the wheel o'distance,

07:05.130 --> 07:07.169
in 305 metres.

07:07.170 --> 07:12.089
But the big question is, how does
a small-engined car like this cope

07:12.090 --> 07:14.490
when it's weighed down with people?

07:16.290 --> 07:19.569
Now, if it's just the Stig,
then it makes no odds,

07:19.570 --> 07:21.010
as you can see quite clearly.

07:21.011 --> 07:23.089
But if it's normal
members of the public,

07:23.090 --> 07:25.610
then I think we may have a problem.

07:26.930 --> 07:29.609
You see,
according to the newspapers,

07:29.610 --> 07:32.849
more than a quarter of adults
are now obese.

07:32.850 --> 07:35.129
And in just a few years' time,

07:35.130 --> 07:39.969
over 50% of the population
will be absolutely enormous.

07:39.970 --> 07:42.449
So, what could
a typical family of the future

07:42.450 --> 07:45.610
do to this car's performance?

07:47.000 --> 07:53.074

TYRES SQUEAL

08:14.890 --> 08:15.970
320...

08:17.410 --> 08:19.249
325...

08:19.250 --> 08:24.249
Right, so with just the Stig,
it was 305 metres.

08:24.250 --> 08:25.603
With our family on board,

08:25.604 --> 08:30.289
it took an extra
177 metres,

08:30.290 --> 08:32.169
more than half as much again.

08:35.289 --> 08:37.169
So, if you buy this car,

08:37.169 --> 08:40.010
you might want to think about
going easy on the pasties.

08:42.490 --> 08:45.050
But trust me, it's worth it.

08:48.410 --> 08:51.129
James Hunt was once famously asked,

08:51.130 --> 08:54.569
what was the best car he'd ever
driven and the answer was not

08:54.570 --> 08:57.369
a Ferrari or a Porsche
or any supercar,

08:57.370 --> 09:00.809
it was his old Austin A35 van,

09:00.810 --> 09:05.569
which had virtually no power
and very, very skinny tyres.

09:05.570 --> 09:09.370
In other words, exactly the same
qualities you get with the Panda.

09:10.970 --> 09:14.929
And if that's good enough
for James Hunt, I rest my case.

09:14.930 --> 09:16.729
Thank you.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.090
And goodbye.

09:22.050 --> 09:25.490
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

09:28.730 --> 09:29.770
I'm...

09:32.083 --> 09:34.769
I'm glad you brought
James Hunt into it, James...

09:34.770 --> 09:36.730
I'm always getting
you two muddled up.

09:36.731 --> 09:39.769
Well, we do have quite
a lot in common. I mean, same name.

09:39.770 --> 09:42.849
Same hair.
I wish you had the same pulse rate.

09:42.850 --> 09:46.489
Because I have never heard
so much drivel.

09:46.490 --> 09:49.049
Let me make it absolutely plain.

09:49.050 --> 09:52.649
A car becomes interesting at
the limit of grip of its tyres, OK?

09:52.650 --> 09:55.889
And in things like a big Lambo or a
big Aston, those things you like,

09:55.890 --> 09:58.009
that happens
at really colossal speed.

09:58.010 --> 10:02.049
So you have to drive them on
the track to have fun in them. Yes.

10:02.050 --> 10:04.729
On a car like this, that stuff
happens at normal speeds,

10:04.730 --> 10:06.490
so you don't need
to go to the track.

10:06.491 --> 10:09.529
You enjoy them on a normal road
at normal speeds.

10:09.530 --> 10:12.969
That's rubbish. A normal hatchback,
you drive it round a city centre,

10:12.970 --> 10:16.369
it's not skidding about
all over the place. But this is.

10:16.370 --> 10:19.409
This is on those eco fuel-saving
tyres. I went straight off...

10:19.410 --> 10:24.009
So you're saying, the Fiat Panda's
good because it crashes more easily?

10:24.010 --> 10:25.329
LAUGHTER

10:25.330 --> 10:26.529
Yes.

10:26.530 --> 10:30.369
And, it's now time to find out
how fast it goes around our track.

10:30.370 --> 10:33.809
No, no, no. The programme isn't
long enough to put a Panda round.

10:33.810 --> 10:35.569
Oh, go on! It isn't, it isn't.

10:35.570 --> 10:38.609
We're going to see how fast
the Vauxhall goes and that means,

10:38.610 --> 10:41.529
of course, handing it over
to our tame racing driver.

10:41.530 --> 10:47.169
Some say that he has 50,000
photographs of his own camera.

10:47.170 --> 10:49.129
LAUGHTER

10:49.130 --> 10:53.517
And that 60 years ago this week,
he, too, became a queen.

10:53.683 --> 10:54.849
LAUGHTER

10:54.850 --> 10:57.450
All we know is
he's called the Stig!

10:59.090 --> 11:01.889
And he's away.
Lots of wheel spin off the line.

11:01.890 --> 11:03.409
It's a cold day out there.

11:03.410 --> 11:07.889
The air's dense and small
turbocharged engines like that.

11:07.890 --> 11:09.969
Look at it flying
into the first corner.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.609
Sticky tyres howling in pain.

11:12.610 --> 11:15.489
"THE ARCHERS" THEME TUNE

11:15.490 --> 11:19.929
Oh, dear, the Stig continues
his obsession with The Archers,

11:19.930 --> 11:22.209
tracking tidily around Chicago.

11:22.210 --> 11:25.569
Clever limited slip diff
doing its job.

11:25.570 --> 11:28.289
Hard on the brakes for Hammerhead.
Will it understeer?

11:28.290 --> 11:30.729
No. Getting a bit squirrelly,
though.

11:30.730 --> 11:32.969
Looks like the back end
wants to step out.

11:32.970 --> 11:35.529
Certainly more exciting
to watch than May's Panda.

11:35.530 --> 11:36.744
'I'm not very hungry.

11:36.745 --> 11:40.609
I've been nibbling all morning
making stuff for the freezer for Thursday.'

11:40.610 --> 11:42.089
Midlands mimsy there.

11:42.090 --> 11:46.289
Right, unleashing all it's got.
Chucking snow on to the follow-through.

11:46.290 --> 11:50.169
There's no doubt, cars developed at
the Nurburgring are useless on the road.

11:50.170 --> 11:53.369
James is right about that but this
isn't a road and it's doing well.

11:53.370 --> 11:56.609
A little blob of phlegm.
Coming up now to Gambon.

11:56.610 --> 11:59.609
Round it like it terrier
and across the line!

11:59.610 --> 12:03.129
APPLAUSE

12:03.130 --> 12:07.089
And it did it in one minute...

12:07.090 --> 12:10.449
19.2.

12:10.450 --> 12:12.809
No, it didn't.

12:12.810 --> 12:15.329
One minute 31 seconds
is where it did it.

12:15.330 --> 12:18.449
So, James, can we now stop doing
small, simple hatchbacks

12:18.450 --> 12:21.529
in the power tests? You can, yes.
Good, thank you.

12:21.530 --> 12:23.089
You are sacked.

12:23.090 --> 12:24.889
LAUGHTER

12:24.890 --> 12:28.329
Well, that's good news. And speaking
of which, it is time to do the news.

12:28.330 --> 12:31.169
I start off with something
very exciting. Because there is

12:31.170 --> 12:33.529
a new Morgan and after an absence
of ten years,

12:33.530 --> 12:35.849
they have revived
their legendary Plus 8 name.

12:35.850 --> 12:39.049
They've made a new one. I have
a picture. Here it is. Oh, yeah.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.889
Oh, God. Morgan don't have
a styling department, do they?

12:41.890 --> 12:44.809
They've just got a photocopier.

12:44.810 --> 12:48.249
It's not like a normal photocopier.
Normally, you select the size.

12:48.250 --> 12:52.129
On Morgans, you select the year.
Anything from 1931 to 1935.

12:52.130 --> 12:55.889
Shut up. It's an all-new car.
It's got the classic body shape, yes.

12:55.890 --> 12:59.249
But it's got
a 4.8-litre BMW V8 in there.

12:59.250 --> 13:01.849
It'll be good for 60,
probably under four seconds.

13:01.850 --> 13:05.769
It's going to be the fastest-accelerating
Morgan they've made ever.

13:05.770 --> 13:08.329
Wow(!) It's exciting!

13:08.330 --> 13:11.929
Do you have to buy the petrol with
those ration coupons? No, shut up.

13:11.930 --> 13:13.330
It's actually very modern.

13:13.331 --> 13:16.649
It's got a bonded aluminium chassis
and the aluminium body

13:16.650 --> 13:19.889
is super formed, it's very hi tech.
What? How many guineas is it?

13:19.890 --> 13:21.569
LAUGHTER

13:21.570 --> 13:23.889
Its 85,000 POUNDS.

13:23.890 --> 13:28.369
It's very modern and hi tech and I want one
of those very much indeed. It's fantastic.

13:28.370 --> 13:31.769
You can't have one, there's a war on.
LAUGHTER

13:31.770 --> 13:33.417
They'll have to melt it down
to make Spitfires.

13:33.418 --> 13:36.169
Shut up, it's exciting
and I want one.

13:36.170 --> 13:40.209
I've got news about Toyota and Subaru
because they've collaborated on a new car.

13:40.210 --> 13:41.689
It's called a GT 86.

13:41.690 --> 13:43.529
This is going to be £25,000,

13:43.530 --> 13:46.649
which makes it more expensive
than a VW Scirocco.

13:46.650 --> 13:49.677
And it's not the best-looking car
in the world, is it?

13:49.843 --> 13:51.049
No, it isn't.

13:51.050 --> 13:53.569
But the interesting thing about it,

13:53.570 --> 13:56.769
the thing that means everyone
is anticipating this very eagerly,

13:56.770 --> 14:00.929
is it has a limited slip
differential and rear-wheel drive.

14:00.930 --> 14:03.209
It's hard to explain
really to non-car people

14:03.210 --> 14:06.769
why real-wheel drive is important.
So, let me put it this way.

14:06.770 --> 14:09.849
Front-wheel drive is cornflour.

14:09.850 --> 14:12.529
And rear-wheel drive it is a roux.

14:12.530 --> 14:15.129
That's quite good, isn't it?
Yes, that's good.

14:15.130 --> 14:16.729
What are you going on about?!

14:16.730 --> 14:21.809
Cornflour,
you use it to thicken a sauce, say.

14:21.810 --> 14:23.770
Why would you want to thicken
a sauce?

14:23.771 --> 14:25.409
Ketchup comes out of a bottle

14:25.410 --> 14:28.289
and I don't want it thicker,
that's just what it is.

14:28.290 --> 14:30.650
I have to let you into
a little secret we learned.

14:30.651 --> 14:33.169
Richard Hammond has his Sunday lunch
every Sunday.

14:33.170 --> 14:36.049
Anyone here familiar with
the Countrywide chain of stores?

14:36.050 --> 14:40.569
Yeah? They are big cash-and-carry
warehouses for rural people.

14:40.570 --> 14:44.769
And you go there and buy stones and
gravel and things for your horses

14:44.770 --> 14:46.849
and he has his lunch there.

14:46.850 --> 14:51.129
They do a nice Sunday roast, 5.99.
How much?

14:51.130 --> 14:54.049
5.99 and you get all
the vegetables you want.

14:54.050 --> 14:56.129
I bet you any money
that they have wilted

14:56.130 --> 14:57.890
cos they've been
boiled for so long.

14:57.891 --> 14:59.103
They're properly cooked,
yeah.

14:59.104 --> 15:01.729
That's not properly cooked!
That's ruined!

15:01.730 --> 15:05.409
"Oh, Richard Hammond will be here on
Sunday, we better put the sprouts on now."

15:05.410 --> 15:08.369
It's like going for your lunch
in B&Q.

15:08.370 --> 15:12.369
A big treat, children, this week, we
are going to have lunch in Halfords!

15:12.370 --> 15:15.729
That's very funny
but can I get back to the car?

15:15.730 --> 15:18.729
The thing about it is,
it isn't a great-looking car

15:18.730 --> 15:23.049
and it is a bit pricey, but,
it also has a boxer engine in it.

15:23.050 --> 15:24.970
Yes, two-litre.
That's good, isn't it?

15:24.971 --> 15:27.929
Would you like to explain, Jeremy,

15:27.930 --> 15:30.769
why having a boxer configuration
engine is a good thing?

15:30.770 --> 15:32.449
Yes, I will.

15:32.450 --> 15:33.689
Really?

15:33.690 --> 15:38.169
A boxer engine is like going to Jamie
Oliver's restaurant for your lunch.

15:38.170 --> 15:41.689
And a normal engine
is like going to Countrywide

15:41.690 --> 15:44.089
with over-boiled vegetables.

15:44.090 --> 15:47.049
It's a nice lunch. They give you
a wooden spoon with a number on

15:47.050 --> 15:51.089
and when they call the number, you get your
meat and then all the vegetables you want.

15:51.090 --> 15:54.969
WEST COUNTRY ACCENT:
"Mr Hammond, your table for four."

15:54.970 --> 15:56.329
LAUGHTER

15:56.330 --> 15:59.569
Good news, chaps. No, what?
There's a new Dacia.

15:59.570 --> 16:01.049
CHEERING
Thank you.

16:01.050 --> 16:05.889
And I've got a picture of it.
That's a looker, isn't it?!

16:05.890 --> 16:07.250
Anyway, moving on.

16:08.690 --> 16:11.529
Whiplash is a charter
for fraudsters.

16:11.530 --> 16:13.529
We all know this.
You have a car accident

16:13.530 --> 16:15.370
and you go, "Oh, I've got whiplash,"

16:15.371 --> 16:18.089
and you rape the other motorist's
insurance policy

16:18.090 --> 16:20.529
and you get benefits
for the rest of your life.

16:20.530 --> 16:23.289
The Government
has said this has to stop.

16:23.290 --> 16:26.169
So they have announced,
the Government, all right,

16:26.170 --> 16:30.809
that if the impact speed
is less than 6.25 miles an hour,

16:30.810 --> 16:33.169
you can't have whiplash.

16:33.170 --> 16:35.609
6.25? 6.25.

16:35.610 --> 16:39.449
But they're also saying that if it is 6.5,
you could get whiplash at that speed.

16:39.450 --> 16:41.929
You can do that speed
sitting down quickly.

16:41.930 --> 16:44.517
Look, I'm doing 6.25,
I've got whiplash.

16:44.530 --> 16:48.797
It should be 63.
That would be a reasonable speed.

16:48.800 --> 16:52.919
The question should be, he is your
car absolutely and entirely wrecked?

16:52.920 --> 16:57.239
Is it crumpled like a discarded crisp bag,
in which case, you might have a point.

16:57.240 --> 17:01.159
Has the boot lid badge been
a stencilled on to your own spine?

17:01.160 --> 17:03.439
Well, then you've got whiplash.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.799
No, it's can you actually
look up your own arse now?

17:06.800 --> 17:08.398
LAUGHTER

17:08.400 --> 17:11.439
Then you've possibly
got some whiplash. Could be.

17:11.440 --> 17:15.199
I do genuinely believe that people
who've got whiplash when they haven't,

17:15.200 --> 17:20.598
I don't believe in capital
punishment, but they should be shot.

17:20.599 --> 17:23.719
Where would you shoot them?
In the head.

17:23.720 --> 17:27.199
I meant more sort of geographically.
Yeah.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.279
Oh, God.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.598
On their own or in front of anyone,
Do you want to say that? Sort it out.

17:30.599 --> 17:32.720
Goes well when you do.
Maybe on a different show.

17:32.721 --> 17:35.719
Let's just get it so we can
straighten out your belief.

17:35.720 --> 17:39.759
Who do you think should be shot,
where and in front of whom?

17:39.760 --> 17:42.199
Oh, now, moving it on...

17:42.200 --> 17:43.839
LAUGHTER

17:43.840 --> 17:48.319
I've got some actual news.
Don't be daft. In our news section?

17:48.320 --> 17:50.599
In the news section.
It's not just rubbish.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.839
Careful,
we're in uncharted waters here. OK.

17:53.840 --> 17:57.599
I have it on good authority that
Land Rover is currently working

17:57.600 --> 18:02.599
on a 300-horsepower convertible
version of the new Evoke.

18:02.600 --> 18:05.119
The Evoke? Have you got a picture?

18:05.120 --> 18:08.439
I've got a picture here of the
hard-top one. It's so secret, this.

18:08.440 --> 18:12.199
Only I... Well, everybody now
knows about it. So I thought...

18:12.200 --> 18:14.907
Stand back, he's got scissors!

18:16.000 --> 18:19.399
Oh ho! Look at him concentrate,
look at him now!

18:19.400 --> 18:21.639
LAUGHTER

18:21.640 --> 18:25.239
It's the Top Gear orang-utan,
look at his happy little face.

18:25.240 --> 18:27.559
Completely absorbed in his own world.

18:27.560 --> 18:29.599
And if you watch very carefully,

18:29.600 --> 18:32.067
you can see Jeremy's mouth
moving in time.

18:33.800 --> 18:36.359
It's quite tricky
going down the wing mirror.

18:36.360 --> 18:39.239
A tricky bit now, isn't it? Ready?

18:39.240 --> 18:40.427
And across the line!

18:41.960 --> 18:45.759
Actually, it looks quite good,
doesn't it! Am I right in saying,

18:45.760 --> 18:48.959
that would be the first ever
convertible off-road car?

18:48.960 --> 18:51.919
Yeah, well, apart from
the original Willys Jeep,

18:51.920 --> 18:55.679
the first Toyota Land Cruiser and the
original Land Rover. Apart from that...

18:55.680 --> 18:59.519
Apart from the very origins, Genesis,
the whole foundation, if you will,

18:59.520 --> 19:01.440
of the entire concept
of the off-roader

19:01.441 --> 19:04.839
is founded upon a convertible.

19:04.840 --> 19:08.119
Did I say that out loud?
You did and we all heard it.

19:08.120 --> 19:11.472
That's a bit like saying they should
make a song called Blue Suede Shoes.

19:11.473 --> 19:13.279
Yes, they should do.

19:13.280 --> 19:15.279
There's a new car
I want to tell you about.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.305
I'll flash it up on the screen
for one second

19:17.306 --> 19:19.399
and I want you to tell me
what it is.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.320
Are you ready?
Here we go. And, on.

19:21.321 --> 19:23.719
And off. What was that?

19:23.720 --> 19:27.119
Aston Martin. You see, it wasn't.

19:27.120 --> 19:31.319
That, in fact, let's get it up
again, that is the new Mondeo.

19:31.320 --> 19:35.319
Is it?
Was it done by a Chinese person?

19:35.320 --> 19:36.799
LAUGHTER

19:36.800 --> 19:39.639
Let me explain
because this is quite complicated.

19:39.640 --> 19:43.079
That's been launched in America
already as the Ford Fusion.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.599
It's not coming to Britain
until next year.

19:45.600 --> 19:49.159
So Ford in Britain, they're not
admitting that is the new Mondeo

19:49.160 --> 19:52.719
because they think people won't
continue to buy the current one
for a year,

19:52.720 --> 19:55.559
but it is the new Mondeo
and it's coming next year, so there.

19:55.560 --> 19:59.519
Now, if you're under 40,
you may not remember

19:59.520 --> 20:01.679
a television show
called The Sweeney.

20:01.680 --> 20:05.079
So, to fill you in, every week,
it was a cop show in essence.

20:05.080 --> 20:08.879
Every week, the hero would have
some casual sex with a lady.

20:08.880 --> 20:11.919
Then he'd punch a baddie in the
middle of his face and then drive

20:11.920 --> 20:16.279
a Ford Granada very briskly across
some waste ground in Saaf London.

20:16.280 --> 20:18.599
Now, the reason we bring this up
is we heard

20:18.600 --> 20:22.439
the other day that they were making
a film of this TV series

20:22.440 --> 20:25.279
starring Ray Winstone and Plan B.

20:25.280 --> 20:27.119
And this gave us an idea.

20:27.120 --> 20:30.919
For ages, we have wanted to make
a proper movie car chase.

20:30.920 --> 20:33.039
We reckon we'd be pretty good at it.

20:33.040 --> 20:35.799
So we got in touch with
the film's producers and we said,

20:35.800 --> 20:38.559
"There's bound to be a car chase
in it so can Hammond and I

20:38.560 --> 20:40.079
"make it for you?"

20:40.080 --> 20:42.747
And they said yes!

20:46.160 --> 20:51.719
This being The Sweeney, the location
was in the Saaf of England.

20:51.720 --> 20:56.599
And while the main crew were
hard at work shooting shoot-outs...

20:56.600 --> 20:59.639
And people jumping off boats,

20:59.640 --> 21:02.599
Hammond and I were trying to decide
what sort of car chase

21:02.600 --> 21:03.760
we wanted to make.

21:03.761 --> 21:06.519
And then there was the Bond film
in Vietnam and it was just

21:06.520 --> 21:10.319
stupid stunt, after stupid stunt,
all shot from a helicopter.

21:10.320 --> 21:11.919
So you never had a sense of speed.

21:11.920 --> 21:16.199
So you want to be close, so if a car
does like a jump and a roll,

21:16.200 --> 21:19.399
you want to be up close
and maybe see the driver's face,

21:19.400 --> 21:21.239
as if you were in the car?

21:21.240 --> 21:26.279
No, there is no jump and roll. There
would be stunts, it is a car chase.

21:26.280 --> 21:27.559
No, no.

21:27.560 --> 21:31.519
Here is an idea. So, say,
helicopter here. Car comes out.

21:31.520 --> 21:33.839
Barrel roll happens. Bam! Boom!

21:33.840 --> 21:36.759
You want be back wide
so you can see the helicopter.

21:36.760 --> 21:40.199
We are not having any cars
crashing into helicopters. But...

21:40.200 --> 21:44.839
No, we're not. Why? Because that's
just stupid. This is the Sweeney.

21:44.840 --> 21:49.639
It's a real police chase. Honestly,
just think. Ronin, Bullitt.

21:49.640 --> 21:51.879
The Italian Job, the original one.

21:51.880 --> 21:54.559
Good, gritty car chases
because they're real.

21:54.560 --> 21:58.479
How many jumps where the car went
"Whee!" Were there in Ronin?

21:58.480 --> 22:01.279
But we need to drag The Sweeney
into this century

22:01.280 --> 22:03.319
so we need cars
going into helicopters.

22:03.320 --> 22:06.759
What are those drawings?
What are those drawings?

22:06.760 --> 22:11.199
Car going into helicopter.
We haven't got... What's that?!

22:11.200 --> 22:13.039
That is very clever.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.599
Right. Train going along.
There isn't a carriage.

22:15.600 --> 22:19.999
It's one of those flat ones.
And he times his jump... No, no, no.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.559
No. There's a chance...

22:21.560 --> 22:24.319
'Since we weren't
getting anywhere...' No!

22:24.320 --> 22:26.517
'...I went off to meet our actors.'

22:28.560 --> 22:32.079
I want to shoot 'em.
No, you've shot four already.

22:32.080 --> 22:34.319
Shoot them together. Hello.

22:34.320 --> 22:39.799
Actors, hi. My name's Richard.
I'm, I'm, the director, I suppose.

22:39.800 --> 22:42.519
And, um, so, you're Plan B?
I'm Plan B, nice to meet you.

22:42.520 --> 22:45.039
Can I call you Plan?
Yeah, if you want.

22:45.040 --> 22:49.679
And, over here, of course, morning.
Delighted to meet you.

22:49.680 --> 22:51.479
Hello, mate.

22:51.480 --> 22:53.959
It's an honour to work with you,
really.

22:53.960 --> 22:55.479
When are you working with us?

22:55.480 --> 22:58.319
Later on today we are going to be
doing some stunt work.

22:58.320 --> 23:01.959
You'll be able to handle it,
the variety of stuff you've done.

23:01.960 --> 23:04.039
We're a bit busy in here
at the minute.

23:04.040 --> 23:05.730
Can you go and rabbit
somewhere else?

23:05.731 --> 23:08.239
I know you are busy,
that's great. It'll be mega!

23:08.240 --> 23:10.919
And you're going to handle all of it
so well.

23:10.920 --> 23:14.559
What am I going to handle well?
What are you talking about?

23:14.560 --> 23:20.239
The Long Good Friday. Grit, anger in
there. The Long Good Friday. Anger.

23:20.240 --> 23:23.959
And the same career, Who Framed
Roger Rabbit? No, that's not him.

23:23.960 --> 23:26.437
No, I'm not Bob Hoskins, mate.

23:29.240 --> 23:32.519
Whilst Hammond was making
friends with the stars,

23:32.520 --> 23:36.560
I was making the cars that
the film's producers had chosen.

23:37.800 --> 23:40.717
The baddies would be using
a Jaguar XFR.

23:42.080 --> 23:45.317
And the goodies, a Ford Focus ST.

23:47.603 --> 23:50.359
And straight away,
there's a problem.

23:50.360 --> 23:53.679
Because anyone who knows anything
about cars will watch this film

23:53.680 --> 23:56.479
and say, "There's no way
that a Ford Focus

23:56.480 --> 24:01.239
"can keep up with a supercharged
500-horsepower V8 Jag."

24:01.240 --> 24:02.839
The speed difference,

24:02.840 --> 24:07.519
as I shall now demonstrate
on our closed piece of road, is...

24:07.520 --> 24:08.640
immense.

24:11.040 --> 24:13.397
ENGINE ROARS

24:22.680 --> 24:26.157
To make matters worse,
this isn't an ST.

24:30.320 --> 24:34.879
It's a 1.6-litre eco boost
with ST badges,

24:34.880 --> 24:38.717
ST wheels and look,
fake dials on the dashboard.

24:45.480 --> 24:50.199
I decided to put these concerns
to the film's director, Nick Love.

24:50.200 --> 24:54.279
The problem you've got is a Ford
Focus cannot keep up with a Jag.

24:54.280 --> 24:56.366
It's about the skill of the driver,
not the car.

24:56.367 --> 24:58.079
It's a story being told.

24:58.080 --> 25:02.879
No. If Regan is a good driver, he
can keep up with anybody. You can't.

25:02.880 --> 25:06.679
You can in my film. You can't,
because we are directing this.

25:06.680 --> 25:09.919
You're going to have to get
faster cars than the Focus.

25:09.920 --> 25:13.039
We have a very restricted amount
of money and we can't...

25:13.040 --> 25:16.439
What are we going to do,
buy Ferraris? What's the budget?

25:16.440 --> 25:19.239
Of the film? Yes.
Three million quid. Whoa!

25:19.240 --> 25:23.039
What, for just this film?
Three million. That's nothing.

25:23.040 --> 25:27.719
Let's put them in Veyrons, Bugatti.
You could get two for that.

25:27.720 --> 25:30.639
Could you also explain to him,
we're trying to keep it real.

25:30.640 --> 25:33.806
He wants to do this thing where
it jumps over a train.

25:33.807 --> 25:36.799
The idea is, get this...
That's bollocks.

25:36.800 --> 25:39.359
A train comes along
and when it comes through,

25:39.360 --> 25:41.999
your man's there in his car
and he times it...

25:42.000 --> 25:45.519
jumps through the gap.
That's real. Brilliant.

25:45.520 --> 25:48.079
We're going to need something
faster than the Focus.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.552
No, we're just going to think big
in terms of action.

25:50.553 --> 25:52.639
This is a motorway bridge.

25:52.640 --> 25:55.679
You know, where they haven't
finished building, but look,

25:55.680 --> 25:59.679
it's beginning to twist and that's
a helicopter. I'm getting a migraine.

25:59.680 --> 26:01.839
You are talking BLEEP,
the pair of you.

26:01.840 --> 26:05.199
You want to do a commercial and you
want a film that no-one will believe.

26:05.200 --> 26:08.757
If you're going to do it, do it
properly, that's all I'm saying.

26:10.280 --> 26:14.119
Having got the distinct impression
that I couldn't change the cars,

26:14.120 --> 26:16.239
I had to get creative.

26:16.240 --> 26:20.959
Sorry about this, mate.
We have the baddie.

26:20.960 --> 26:23.517
So, the front-wheel drive Ford

26:23.518 --> 26:26.959
would be driven by former rally
champion Mark Higgins,

26:26.960 --> 26:31.959
and the rear-drive Jag by
drifting world champion Mauro Calo.

26:31.960 --> 26:35.397
OK. Three, two, one,
to catch up, go.

26:36.480 --> 26:39.319
And to get round
the speed difference,

26:39.320 --> 26:43.077
I'd created a scene in which
the Jag is held up by traffic.

26:44.680 --> 26:47.079
HORN BLARES

26:47.080 --> 26:50.597
And three, two, one, hit.

26:53.120 --> 26:54.917
Try again, try again, try again.

26:56.960 --> 26:58.679
Whoa!

26:58.680 --> 26:59.800
Yes!

27:01.920 --> 27:04.280
Man alive,
are we getting some shots here!

27:07.440 --> 27:10.959
Whilst Jeremy was lost
in the land of reality,

27:10.960 --> 27:13.639
I was at the location
for the climax of the chase,

27:13.640 --> 27:19.239
a deserted caravan park, where
I was setting up a dramatic jump.

27:19.240 --> 27:22.359
You're all right, you're all right.

27:22.360 --> 27:25.639
Oh, yeah. And hold it there,
that's perfect.

27:25.640 --> 27:28.599
I come racing up that field.
Between those two posts

27:28.600 --> 27:31.679
there'll be a barrier and I smash
through it. That's some drama.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.279
Up the ramp, I get air.

27:33.280 --> 27:36.479
There, past the caravans
and land on the grass.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.519
With the ramp
hidden from the cameras,

27:38.520 --> 27:41.919
I nicked one of the back-up Focuses
and was ready to go.

27:41.920 --> 27:44.679
I'd love it if they use
the actual shot with me doing it.

27:44.680 --> 27:47.199
That would be brilliant.
I'd be in the film.

27:47.200 --> 27:50.720
First off,
drive through the gate post.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.680
And now, get me some air!

27:57.800 --> 28:01.919
Yeah! That felt good, that felt
like we had air and everything.

28:01.920 --> 28:05.240
However, when I watched it
back on the monitor...

28:07.320 --> 28:08.560
Play it again.

28:10.680 --> 28:11.840
This is rubbish.

28:15.040 --> 28:18.839
Meanwhile, I was now filming
the cars from the front,

28:18.840 --> 28:23.119
which meant my drivers had to be made
to look exactly like the main actors.

28:23.120 --> 28:25.919
What's going to happen
is your alongside him.

28:25.920 --> 28:29.359
You're going exactly the same speed.
When he's ready to make this turn,

28:29.360 --> 28:32.879
you're not ready to make this turn,
you think he's going on down there.

28:32.880 --> 28:35.599
He's going to lock up,
which causes your handbrake turn

28:35.600 --> 28:37.120
but we'll get that in a minute.

28:38.560 --> 28:41.839
I then disconnected the Jag's
anti-lock brakes so it would lock up

28:41.840 --> 28:46.199
in a cloud of tyre smoke
and then we went for a take.

28:46.200 --> 28:47.560
OK, we're ready.

28:48.880 --> 28:52.159
Mark, less moving around,
less moving.

28:52.160 --> 28:53.720
Yes, that's good.

28:57.520 --> 28:58.920
Oh!

29:00.680 --> 29:02.480
TYRES SQUEAL

29:04.320 --> 29:05.559
Ooh!

29:05.560 --> 29:08.959
I may have to go to the lavatory
for a little while.

29:08.960 --> 29:12.120
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

29:14.320 --> 29:16.759
What? Hold on a minute.

29:16.760 --> 29:20.919
How the hell could you not know
who Ray Winstone is?

29:20.920 --> 29:23.567
Think that it - middle-aged,
Cockney actor,

29:23.568 --> 29:25.599
it's just Bob Hoskins, isn't it?
It just is.

29:25.600 --> 29:28.919
And that bit with the car
when you drove them together,

29:28.920 --> 29:32.079
that was just wanton destruction?
No, it wasn't.

29:32.080 --> 29:34.799
We had three Jags.
And five Ford Focuses.

29:34.800 --> 29:38.639
And remember, we had £3 million
to play with.

29:38.640 --> 29:40.280
No, we didn't have
three million quid

29:40.281 --> 29:43.279
but we were allowed to do
light damage. We really were.

29:43.280 --> 29:45.080
Anyway,
we'll pick that up later on.

29:45.081 --> 29:49.479
Now, it is time to put
a star in our reasonably priced car.

29:49.480 --> 29:52.359
Over the years, we've had
many guests on this programme.

29:52.360 --> 29:54.559
All different sorts. Men, women,

29:54.560 --> 29:56.999
Americans, Germans.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.279
A lesbian.

29:58.280 --> 29:59.479
LAUGHTER

29:59.480 --> 30:01.879
We've never had a Canadian, though.

30:01.880 --> 30:04.639
That, however,
is ABOOT to change.

30:04.640 --> 30:08.039
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Ryan Reynolds!

30:08.040 --> 30:10.960
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

30:12.600 --> 30:14.759
How are you?
I'm very well, how are you?

30:14.760 --> 30:16.200
I'm very well, thank you.

30:16.201 --> 30:18.400
Hi, everybody. Hello, hello.

30:20.200 --> 30:21.919
Hello! Have a seat.

30:21.920 --> 30:24.799
I'd love to. Have a seat.

30:24.800 --> 30:28.359
It's like looking in a mirror!
It really is!

30:28.360 --> 30:30.079
It really is! Not for you!

30:30.080 --> 30:33.759
So, 2010, you were voted
the sexiest man alive.

30:33.760 --> 30:36.439
AUDIENCE: Woo!

30:36.440 --> 30:37.919
That was 2010, though!

30:37.920 --> 30:40.519
I'm on the lecture circuit now!

30:40.520 --> 30:42.959
I was just thinking,
your schooldays,

30:42.960 --> 30:46.559
were they just a blizzard of
snogging and smooth moves?

30:46.560 --> 30:52.079
No, it wasn't that. I was a bit of
a little pariah at school.

30:52.080 --> 30:53.599
I have three older brothers,

30:53.600 --> 30:56.319
all of whom were kicked out of
this very same school,

30:56.320 --> 30:58.879
so from the moment I got there,
I was a marked man.

30:58.880 --> 31:00.360
What were they kicked out for?

31:00.361 --> 31:02.959
Just random things.
Just mostly drugs and violence.

31:02.960 --> 31:04.879
OK!

31:04.880 --> 31:08.599
And I was kicked out for something
I think you'd appreciate.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.959
I was kicked out for stealing a car.

31:10.960 --> 31:15.359
Stealing a car? But wait,
I didn't actually steal a vehicle.

31:15.360 --> 31:19.919
What we did was, a teacher that
we had was just 100% awful,

31:19.920 --> 31:23.319
he had this little car,
one of those little Volkswagens,

31:23.320 --> 31:26.559
and so my friends and I just played
an April Fools' prank on him.

31:26.560 --> 31:29.879
We picked it up, we lifted it up
and carried it down the block,

31:29.880 --> 31:31.120
about eight of us.

31:31.121 --> 31:32.974
We talked about this last week.

31:32.975 --> 31:35.159
The best fun you can have
with a little car is pick it up

31:35.160 --> 31:38.479
and turn it round so it's facing
the other way... Fun practical joke.

31:38.480 --> 31:39.720
That's a better idea,

31:39.721 --> 31:44.239
because in Canada, if you move it
more than ten feet, it's a felony.

31:44.240 --> 31:45.799
I didn't know that.

31:45.800 --> 31:47.638
So you moved a car
more than ten feet

31:47.639 --> 31:49.520
and then that was grand theft auto?

31:49.521 --> 31:52.079
Yeah, one city block
was, yeah, 100% grand theft.

31:52.080 --> 31:56.039
Now, obviously,
sexiest man alive, 2010,

31:56.040 --> 31:59.399
but reading through your notes,
also clumsiest man alive.

31:59.400 --> 32:01.879
Mmm. Oh, definitely, yeah.

32:01.880 --> 32:04.639
There's a thing...
Zurich, Switzerland...

32:04.640 --> 32:06.959
it is impossible to
hurt yourself in Zurich.

32:06.960 --> 32:09.679
You go there, you eat cheese
and then you come home.

32:09.680 --> 32:13.519
So, how did you manage to hurt
yourself? I jumped off a bridge.

32:13.520 --> 32:15.959
But there was water below.

32:15.960 --> 32:19.239
And I dove in and
I broke a vertebrae by diving in.

32:19.240 --> 32:20.839
AUDIENC GROANS

32:20.840 --> 32:24.119
You've also been run over?
I have been run over, yeah.

32:24.120 --> 32:26.959
I was 19 years old, I was
in Vancouver and I was at a bar,

32:26.960 --> 32:30.439
I had a few drinks, I'd left my car
and I decided to walk home.

32:30.440 --> 32:31.999
Being responsible. Exactly.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.599
And I was crossing the street,
it was about two in the morning

32:35.600 --> 32:37.640
and I was hit by a drunk driver.

32:39.160 --> 32:40.719
LAUGHTER

32:40.720 --> 32:44.479
I always wondered if he tells people
that he got hit by a drunk pedestrian.

32:44.480 --> 32:45.679
LAUGHTER

32:45.680 --> 32:47.040
I would. So did that hurt?

32:47.041 --> 32:49.319
Yeah, that was bad.
I broke a lot of bones.

32:49.320 --> 32:51.759
That was all the left side
of my body I broke.

32:51.760 --> 32:55.359
But I was 19, so at that point,
you're just made of rubber and magic.

32:55.360 --> 32:57.159
LAUGHTER

32:57.160 --> 32:58.437
You healed?
Yeah.

32:58.603 --> 33:01.509
Bearing in mind you can't jump off
a bridge without breaking your back,

33:01.510 --> 33:05.269
was skydiving
the perfect hobby to take up?

33:05.270 --> 33:07.429
God, you're like my mother!

33:07.430 --> 33:09.989
LAUGHTER
Old enough! Just killing me!

33:09.990 --> 33:12.989
My friends were trying to
get their license,

33:12.990 --> 33:16.149
so I decided I would
get my license, skydiving,

33:16.150 --> 33:21.909
and I did 12 jumps,
which were all highly successful!

33:21.910 --> 33:24.109
And then it was 13!

33:24.110 --> 33:27.909
And the 13th one, I had a problem,
where the chute didn't open,

33:27.910 --> 33:29.829
and I had to pull the reserve.

33:29.830 --> 33:33.149
But the weird thing is, when
you're in a situation like that,

33:33.150 --> 33:35.589
you're flying down
at 120 miles per hour,

33:35.590 --> 33:37.389
and when your chute doesn't open,

33:37.390 --> 33:40.069
you seriously have to think about
pulling the other one.

33:40.070 --> 33:43.149
That's the weird thing.
Time slows down and you're thinking,

33:43.150 --> 33:45.789
"If I pull the other one,
then I'll have none left."

33:45.790 --> 33:47.230
LAUGHTER

33:49.190 --> 33:52.149
"So, I'm just going to wait to see
if something happens."

33:52.150 --> 33:55.709
And sure enough, at the last minute,
I pulled the reserve chute,

33:55.710 --> 33:58.429
which you can't steer,
and I ended up landing in a field

33:58.430 --> 34:01.749
which contained only a dead horse.
I don't know what omen that is.

34:01.750 --> 34:05.229
Usually, it's a black crow
that tells you you're going to die,

34:05.230 --> 34:07.869
but I just landed
next to a dead horse.

34:07.870 --> 34:10.469
You have a new film out, Safe House.
I do, yeah.

34:10.469 --> 34:14.389
So when's the movie out? The film
is out February 24th here in the UK.

34:14.389 --> 34:17.309
We have a clip of that, which
we're going to show for you now.

34:17.310 --> 34:18.909
Let's have a look.

34:21.870 --> 34:24.190
TYRES SQUEAL

34:48.909 --> 34:50.349
APPLAUSE

34:50.350 --> 34:52.509
That's a good crash!

34:52.510 --> 34:54.550
It was a good crash!

34:57.830 --> 35:01.189
That's Denzel Washington.
Yes, backseat driving right there!

35:01.190 --> 35:03.189
Elbowing you in the face! Yeah.

35:03.190 --> 35:06.469
So what is it about?
Give us the plot, give us the story.

35:06.470 --> 35:11.149
I play a guy who's what's called
a safe house operator, a housekeeper.

35:11.150 --> 35:15.069
There are CIA-owned apartments
and flats all around the world,

35:15.070 --> 35:17.549
and they're run by
usually a low-level CIA guy.

35:17.550 --> 35:21.429
And then, one day, in walks
Denzel Washington's character,

35:21.430 --> 35:23.870
who's probably one of
the world's worst murdering,

35:23.871 --> 35:26.469
sociopathic Hannibal Lecter types.

35:26.470 --> 35:28.709
And I'm left to deal with this guy,

35:28.710 --> 35:31.949
who I'm deeply ill-equipped
to deal with.

35:31.950 --> 35:36.469
So it's not like
The Devil Wears Prada, then? No!

35:36.470 --> 35:37.989
It's not The Proposal II.

35:37.990 --> 35:40.669
It's not a romcom. No, that's good.

35:40.670 --> 35:44.909
Can I just say that God
is normally quite fair... Yeah.

35:44.910 --> 35:48.029
... with his dishing-out of talents.
For instance, David Beckham,

35:48.030 --> 35:50.309
he's said, "He's going to be
very good-looking,

35:50.310 --> 35:51.949
"talented footballer,

35:51.950 --> 35:55.949
"and to balance that up,
I'll give him a squeaky voice."

35:55.950 --> 35:58.590
You're funny and good-looking
and not fat...

36:00.630 --> 36:02.989
... where's your squeaky voice?

36:02.990 --> 36:05.149
What's my...? Have you got BO?

36:05.150 --> 36:09.189
Have I got 41 nipples?
Have you got very tiny testes?

36:09.190 --> 36:12.109
It's like Braille
down there, Jeremy.

36:12.110 --> 36:14.110
LAUGHTER

36:15.590 --> 36:18.469
A very short novel.
That's what it is - Braille.

36:18.470 --> 36:19.710
Yeah, the whole system.

36:21.310 --> 36:24.269
Everybody has...
I have a lot of things wrong.

36:24.270 --> 36:26.349
I'm blind, I'm deaf,

36:26.350 --> 36:29.029
I've got no sense of smell
cos I have a cold,

36:29.030 --> 36:30.829
which I haven't mentioned.

36:30.830 --> 36:34.069
Thank you
for the tongue kiss earlier.

36:34.070 --> 36:36.189
LAUGHTER

36:36.190 --> 36:38.590
Just went deep with it, too!

36:39.790 --> 36:42.789
No, we all have crazy faults.

36:42.790 --> 36:45.589
My fault isn't
something horrendous, like,

36:45.590 --> 36:47.749
"I can't stop murdering children."

36:47.750 --> 36:51.269
LAUGHTER
I just can't stop.

36:51.270 --> 36:53.469
I like to think
I'm a horrible driver...

36:53.470 --> 36:55.509
Horrible or bad?

36:55.510 --> 36:59.349
I ride motorcycles everywhere, so
you can race up through traffic,

36:59.350 --> 37:01.942
it's bumper to bumper,

37:01.943 --> 37:03.989
and when your oncoming traffic is stopped,
you just go right up the middle.

37:03.990 --> 37:06.709
But I have this tendency
when I am in a vehicle to think

37:06.710 --> 37:09.509
I can slip that entire vehicle
right up the middle.

37:09.510 --> 37:13.269
And it's only at the last second when
I'm hitting the brakes, coming to a halt.

37:13.270 --> 37:16.709
You remember you're in a car. You
like bikes? I like bikes a lot, yeah.

37:16.710 --> 37:18.429
What sort of bikes?

37:18.430 --> 37:23.189
I have an old Paul Smart Ducati,
which is a nice little bike.

37:23.190 --> 37:24.350
I know what a Ducati is!

37:24.351 --> 37:27.509
Yeah, Ducati. I have a Deus.
Is it "Deuce" or "Day-us"?

37:27.510 --> 37:29.149
"Day-us", yeah. It's D-E-U-S?

37:29.150 --> 37:30.550
That's how we pronounce it,

37:30.551 --> 37:34.549
but you guys say "Niss-un",
so I have no idea what's happening.

37:34.550 --> 37:37.149
Every car's pronounced differently
in America.

37:37.150 --> 37:40.549
The Hyundai's a "Hundee".
"Nee-sun, Vee-dub-ya, Jag-war.

37:40.550 --> 37:42.109
"Bee-em-dub-ya."

37:42.110 --> 37:43.989
Here, what is it, "Jag-yur"?

37:43.990 --> 37:46.749
"Jag-yoo-ar." How it's spelt. Yeah.

37:46.750 --> 37:49.357
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

37:50.750 --> 37:53.237
No, I'm sorry, that was mean of me!

37:55.550 --> 37:58.029
Now, you came down here to obviously

37:58.030 --> 38:01.029
try your hand
in the Kia Cee-apostrophe-d.

38:01.030 --> 38:02.389
What was your goal?

38:02.390 --> 38:05.629
My goal was just to see if I could
drive a manual car.

38:05.630 --> 38:08.829
I haven't done that since high
school, so that was interesting.

38:08.830 --> 38:10.629
Really? Yeah.

38:10.630 --> 38:13.709
Who'd like to see Ryan's lap?
Oh, boy. AUDIENCE: Yeah!

38:13.710 --> 38:15.037
Play the tape!

38:17.790 --> 38:20.029
'Aggressive start. Crisp day.'

38:20.030 --> 38:23.389
That smells exactly like clutch.

38:23.390 --> 38:24.630
'Smells like clutch?

38:24.631 --> 38:27.389
'Clutch does smell like clutch.'
'Does smell bad, yeah.'

38:27.390 --> 38:29.790
'Annoying thing.
The wide Formula 1 line in there.'

38:29.791 --> 38:33.109
'I'm a big guy, I make that whole
car look like a children's toy.'

38:33.110 --> 38:37.389
'You should see me in it.' 'Looks
like a sweater, made of metal.'

38:37.390 --> 38:39.549
LAUGHTER

38:39.550 --> 38:41.870
'Every time I shift,
I make a dumb face.'

38:42.870 --> 38:45.269
'That's wide,
that's really wide.' 'Terrible.'

38:45.270 --> 38:47.869
'No, it could give you a fast...
Where are you going?'

38:47.870 --> 38:49.549
BLEEP! BLEEP manual! BLEEP!

38:49.550 --> 38:51.590
'Yeah! There! Right?'

38:52.710 --> 38:56.149
'The beep machine has
obviously blown up...

38:56.150 --> 39:00.389
'Now, keeping it tidy through
the lines there. Yes, pretty good.

39:00.390 --> 39:02.029
'Very good, actually.'

39:02.030 --> 39:03.429
Very good.

39:03.430 --> 39:06.709
'Are we going to be able
to find fourth?'

39:06.710 --> 39:10.509
Turn from hell coming up.

39:10.510 --> 39:12.669
'Oh, yeah, this turn,
not fun every time.'

39:12.670 --> 39:15.349
'That's almost beautiful.' 'Yeah.

39:15.350 --> 39:17.270
'That's what I call
the adult diaper.'

39:17.271 --> 39:18.989
'Whoa, that's cutting that one!

39:18.990 --> 39:21.909
'That's quite uncomfortable
at that speed.' 'Yeah.'

39:21.910 --> 39:26.629
'Look at it gripping. That's nicely
done. Not too cheaty on the cutting.

39:26.630 --> 39:28.869
'And around Gambon.'

39:28.870 --> 39:32.349
There we are, ladies and gentlemen,
across the line! There we go!

39:32.350 --> 39:34.349
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

39:34.350 --> 39:35.749
Wow!

39:35.750 --> 39:37.829
So...

39:37.830 --> 39:41.589
Where would you like to appear
on the board?

39:41.590 --> 39:44.229
I'm going to say
somewhere in the middle.

39:44.230 --> 39:47.669
Didn't you... Actually, I know you
did, cos you told our researchers,

39:47.670 --> 39:50.589
you were desperate,
cos you went back out...

39:50.590 --> 39:53.349
"Do you mind if I have another go?"
"Give me another shot."

39:53.350 --> 39:56.309
Cos you wanted to beat Tom Cruise.

39:56.310 --> 40:00.509
Yeah, I did want to beat Tom Cruise. I
wasn't talking about the driving, though.

40:00.510 --> 40:01.917
LAUGHTER

40:03.630 --> 40:06.829
Yes, I'm going to guess
that I have 1:45.

40:06.830 --> 40:10.189
1:45? And that's being
really generous.

40:10.190 --> 40:12.470
You did a one... Ugh!

40:14.230 --> 40:16.189
This is terrible... forty...

40:16.190 --> 40:18.269
OK, there's a four.

40:18.270 --> 40:19.549
... three... Oh!

40:19.550 --> 40:21.469
AUDIENCE: Ooh!

40:21.470 --> 40:24.109
... point seven. You beat Tom Cruise!

40:24.110 --> 40:26.109
You're a faster driver!

40:26.110 --> 40:28.629
Wow!

40:28.630 --> 40:30.469
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

40:30.470 --> 40:31.757
Wow! All right!

40:33.310 --> 40:36.717
Congratulations. Give me that cold!

40:37.830 --> 40:38.910
Take that back!

40:42.150 --> 40:43.190
This is...

40:44.430 --> 40:48.629
Wow, that's worth
getting your pneumonia for!

40:48.630 --> 40:49.949
I love that!

40:49.950 --> 40:52.597
Life just gets worse.

40:54.270 --> 40:58.269
You look like that and you're funny
and you're a film star

40:58.270 --> 40:59.510
and you can drive.

41:00.670 --> 41:03.189
Yeah, but I break every bone
in my body

41:03.190 --> 41:06.629
almost with the cycle of each moon,
so don't worry.

41:06.630 --> 41:08.429
I'll hurt myself on the way out.

41:08.430 --> 41:11.269
Well, it's been a pleasure
to meet you,

41:11.270 --> 41:14.509
and a pleasure for those girls
to stand so close to you. Thank you!

41:14.510 --> 41:16.749
Ladies and gentlemen, Ryan Reynolds!

41:16.750 --> 41:19.637
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

41:25.510 --> 41:29.469
Now, tonight, Jeremy and I are
having a go at making a car chase

41:29.470 --> 41:31.189
for the new Sweeney movie,

41:31.190 --> 41:34.669
and so far, well, there have been
a few disagreements.

41:34.670 --> 41:38.749
Jeremy wants the action to
be "realistic", which means "boring".

41:38.750 --> 41:42.589
I want it to be exciting, full of
stunts and massive explosions.

41:42.590 --> 41:43.797
It's a film!

41:45.470 --> 41:49.589
What we've done now is
we've reconnected the ABS,

41:49.590 --> 41:52.149
the electronic differential
is now working,

41:52.150 --> 41:55.629
so he should be able to do
a power slide through there.

41:55.630 --> 41:59.037
Yeah. Okey doke, here we go.
Three, two, one, hit it.

42:05.350 --> 42:06.469
Yes, yes!

42:06.470 --> 42:09.989
'Whilst Jeremy was faffing around
with his anti-lock brakes,

42:09.990 --> 42:11.989
'I'd raided The Sweeney's budget

42:11.990 --> 42:15.189
'and come up with a way of getting
the car to jump properly.'

42:15.190 --> 42:16.629
It's an air cannon.

42:16.630 --> 42:19.189
What it does is,
car mounted up on the cannon there,

42:19.190 --> 42:22.709
it charges with a huge compressor
there - it's actually nitrogen...

42:22.710 --> 42:26.629
and it fires the car out over
that way, so you get big air.

42:26.630 --> 42:29.949
Jeremy said about keeping it real -
well, check this out.

42:29.950 --> 42:34.829
Up there. So often when you see a car jump
in a film, you realise the engine's gone.

42:34.830 --> 42:36.789
Not this time - I've left it in.

42:36.790 --> 42:39.189
Three million quid -
what's an engine?

42:39.190 --> 42:42.429
'With the cannon primed,
we were ready for lift-off.'

42:42.430 --> 42:44.830
OK, three, two, one!

42:54.950 --> 42:56.789
That's the jump!

42:56.790 --> 42:57.989
Yes!

42:57.990 --> 43:01.749
'Mr Picky, however,
wasn't so impressed.'

43:01.750 --> 43:05.229
Have you ever heard
the word "continuity"? Yes.

43:05.230 --> 43:06.590
Here is your car.

43:07.590 --> 43:11.109
Yes. Right, the next shot is what?

43:11.110 --> 43:12.350
The next shot is...

43:12.351 --> 43:16.709
Ah, no, this is where there'll be
another car driving away.

43:16.710 --> 43:19.510
No, we see it land on its roof...

43:20.830 --> 43:25.749
... and then we're expected to believe
that somehow it's still driveable?

43:25.750 --> 43:28.309
This is the movies,
that's what happens.

43:28.310 --> 43:32.109
Did you never watch... CHiPs?
Remember that?

43:32.110 --> 43:34.789
They'd ride along, one minute
you've got a man on a Harley

43:34.790 --> 43:37.389
approaching the back of a lorry
with its tailgate down,

43:37.390 --> 43:40.109
then he's done a massive jump,
briefly he's on a dirt bike,

43:40.110 --> 43:42.389
then he lands,
he's back on the Harley again.

43:42.390 --> 43:45.069
That's rubbish. That's the movies!
We all expect that!

43:45.070 --> 43:48.429
This car will never work!
It's not plausible!

43:48.430 --> 43:52.029
You can't edit your way out of that!

43:52.030 --> 43:55.709
Just let me get in the edit suite
and work some magic.

43:55.710 --> 43:57.637
You won't believe it.

44:01.230 --> 44:04.069
'First, though, I needed
some close-up shots of the actors,

44:04.070 --> 44:06.149
'which I would then cut
into the scene

44:06.150 --> 44:08.549
'where the car flies
through the air.'

44:08.550 --> 44:11.669
Does Nick know about this? Yeah,
yeah, bang on. Are you sure? Yeah.

44:11.670 --> 44:14.572
'Because we'd got off
to a bad start,

44:14.573 --> 44:17.389
I was keen to demonstrate
they were in good hands.'

44:17.390 --> 44:20.909
You're going to be in the air,
and at that point,

44:20.910 --> 44:25.749
if you'd both give me excitement -
you're in a chase - elation...

44:25.750 --> 44:28.789
you're in the air - but I want to see
determination as well.

44:28.790 --> 44:33.389
You're in a chase,
mixed with vengeful, righteous fury.

44:33.390 --> 44:36.189
So there's so many emotions
going on in this split second,

44:36.190 --> 44:38.989
there's so many emotions
you're going to have to feel.

44:38.990 --> 44:40.749
Let's start with nothing, OK? OK.

44:40.750 --> 44:43.109
That's a blank canvas.
As you hit the ramp...

44:43.110 --> 44:47.069
Richard, I don't feel like
you're giving me enough direction.

44:47.070 --> 44:50.309
You're giving it all to him. What
about me? Ben, blank again for me.

44:50.310 --> 44:52.549
Blank. You're throwing a hissy now,
ain't you?

44:52.550 --> 44:55.829
Let's blank it and let's start...

44:55.830 --> 45:01.029
OK, remember, elation, excitement,
vengeful fury and fear.

45:01.030 --> 45:03.029
So, vengeful fury comes before fear?

45:03.030 --> 45:05.470
At the same time.
What am I frightened of, though?

45:05.471 --> 45:07.069
It's already happened, ain't it?

45:07.070 --> 45:09.069
I wouldn't be frightened
after the event.

45:09.070 --> 45:11.949
Wouldn't I be frightened when
I'm in the air? We're in the air.

45:11.950 --> 45:17.269
Oh, them four emotions
take place in the air? Yeah.

45:17.270 --> 45:20.509
You're in the air for a while.
It'll be a long while, won't it?

45:20.510 --> 45:21.750
It's a big jump.

45:21.751 --> 45:24.229
And just one last thing -
we have to land.

45:24.230 --> 45:27.589
I'm going to say, "Forwards,"
and you go forwards, I'm going say,

45:27.590 --> 45:30.269
"Backwards..."
Forwards, backwards, and away.

45:30.270 --> 45:33.069
Forwards, backwards,
forwards and away,

45:33.070 --> 45:35.589
or backwards, forwards, backwards?

45:35.590 --> 45:39.469
No, it's forwards,
you land forwards, backwards,

45:39.470 --> 45:41.629
forwards, backwards, then drive away.

45:41.630 --> 45:43.949
I thought there had to be
another backwards.

45:43.950 --> 45:45.669
Oh, I'm confused. Don't forget,

45:45.670 --> 45:50.389
I want to catch just a whispering
trace of those emotions from the sky.

45:50.390 --> 45:53.149
They're dissipating as you land...

45:53.150 --> 45:55.837
Oh, don't he go on! BLEEP sake.

45:57.230 --> 46:00.269
'While Richard Ford Coppola
was with the stars,

46:00.270 --> 46:02.989
'I was trying to make
the angry director

46:02.990 --> 46:07.829
'understand the problems of driving
a big Jag around a caravan park.'

46:07.830 --> 46:12.989
I have to slide this car on grass,
and the problem is,

46:12.990 --> 46:17.029
the traction control is on,
so it's not letting me slide.

46:17.030 --> 46:18.429
Foot hard down.

46:18.430 --> 46:21.357
Hard down, and it won't slide.

46:23.630 --> 46:26.389
That is the traction control on.

46:26.390 --> 46:28.429
Can I just say, that was BLEEP.

46:28.430 --> 46:31.229
Do you want to see it
with traction control off?

46:31.230 --> 46:32.269
Yeah. OK.

46:32.270 --> 46:33.870
Now watch this. OK.

46:37.230 --> 46:39.717
Get the power on, feel the tail go.

46:40.790 --> 46:41.870
Hold that slide.

46:45.470 --> 46:48.269
That is what we need.

46:48.270 --> 46:51.829
Which do you prefer,
traction control on or off?

46:51.830 --> 46:52.869
Off. Off?

46:52.870 --> 46:56.189
Yes. That means you're going to
have to have a line of dialogue

46:56.190 --> 46:59.270
where one of them says,
"Turn the traction control off."

47:00.430 --> 47:03.829
Not in my film, no. You're going to
have to. It's ten seconds to do it.

47:03.830 --> 47:05.750
You have to hold it down
for ten seconds.

47:05.751 --> 47:09.029
Anyone who's got a Jag watching the
film will go, "You can't do that."

47:09.030 --> 47:11.789
It doesn't matter. It's not
a BLEEP film for Jag watchers.

47:11.790 --> 47:13.909
It's a film for everyone
to go to the cinema.

47:13.910 --> 47:16.869
Why doesn't he say,
"Why do they make it ten seconds?"

47:16.870 --> 47:19.349
He can say that.
No! Cos it kills the...

47:19.350 --> 47:22.149
WALKIE TALKIE BEEPS
Oh, BLEEP off. It kills the tension!

47:22.150 --> 47:24.309
I want a film that connects
to a wide audience.

47:24.310 --> 47:27.309
I know, but...
Can I finish? Can I just speak?

47:27.310 --> 47:30.949
90 minutes into the film
is the main car chase.

47:30.950 --> 47:33.349
You can't have someone pressing
a BLEEP button.

47:33.350 --> 47:36.389
What are you going to do,
a close-up of a button? Yeah.

47:36.390 --> 47:38.549
You're not putting that in my film.

47:38.550 --> 47:41.589
I like the traction control off,
I don't want all bollocks

47:41.590 --> 47:43.789
about what it does
and what it doesn't do.

47:43.790 --> 47:46.429
You said you wanted me
to do something real.

47:46.430 --> 47:48.029
I'm doing something real.

47:48.030 --> 47:51.350
Actually, you know
what you should do - BLEEP off.

47:54.750 --> 47:58.509
'This altercation meant the director
was not in the best of moods

47:58.510 --> 48:01.589
'when he went to have a look
at an edit of Richard's big jump.'

48:01.590 --> 48:03.789
Right, look.
This is still work in progress,

48:03.790 --> 48:06.229
but I have begun
the polishing process,

48:06.230 --> 48:08.469
and I've worked on the sound. OK.

48:08.470 --> 48:09.510
Enjoy.

48:15.030 --> 48:17.789
TYRES SCREECH LOUDLY

48:17.790 --> 48:21.517
ENGINE REVS LOUDLY

48:24.070 --> 48:25.237
EXPLOSION

48:26.950 --> 48:28.557
BLEEP!

48:34.870 --> 48:36.430
TYRES SCREECH

48:39.950 --> 48:41.910
It's all there, isn't it?

48:47.570 --> 48:50.969
OK, what I've done here is
I've set up a practice area

48:50.970 --> 48:52.250
for the next stunt,

48:52.251 --> 48:56.569
so I don't leave tyre marks
in the grass at the actual location,

48:56.570 --> 48:57.889
which is over there.

48:57.890 --> 48:59.530
DISTANT SHOUTS

49:02.450 --> 49:06.729
Well, I guess we were wondering
how the world's angriest man

49:06.730 --> 49:11.329
would respond to Hammond's car jump,
and now we know.

49:11.330 --> 49:14.650
Come here, you BLEEP! Little BLEEP!
I'll kill you!

49:17.730 --> 49:20.569
'Because the director
was busy hurting Richard

49:20.570 --> 49:22.529
'for writing off one of the Fords,

49:22.530 --> 49:26.289
'I seized the opportunity to give
the baddies their new dialogue.'

49:26.290 --> 49:28.569
You're driving, aren't you? Yes.

49:28.570 --> 49:31.009
I need you to say,
"Turn off the ABS."

49:31.010 --> 49:35.049
You say, "How?"
And you say, "Pull the rhythm."

49:35.050 --> 49:37.529
How do you say that
in Serbian? What?

49:37.530 --> 49:39.929
How do you say it in Serbian?
I'm Serbian.

49:39.930 --> 49:42.329
You're Serbian? Yeah.

49:42.330 --> 49:45.289
Have a look. I've written
this all in rhyming slang.

49:45.290 --> 49:46.609
Rhythm and blues - fuse.

49:46.610 --> 49:49.649
Or you could say "Rodney".
No, he's a Serb.

49:49.650 --> 49:52.689
But he'll have learned his English,
won't you, in London.

49:52.690 --> 49:54.769
He's only been here a day.

49:54.770 --> 49:58.129
Rhythm. Do it with a Borat accent.
AS BORAT: Pull the Rodney.

49:58.130 --> 49:59.929
AS BORAT: Pull the Rodney. Yes!

49:59.930 --> 50:02.569
AS BORAT: Pull the Rodney.
Rodney Bewes, fuse.

50:02.570 --> 50:04.129
Similarly... Go on.

50:04.130 --> 50:08.089
You go, "How many horsepower
has that Ford got?" OK, right.

50:08.090 --> 50:13.889
"250." It hasn't actually, really,
but don't let that bother you.

50:13.890 --> 50:17.289
"250." "God, Plod must be Robin."

50:17.290 --> 50:19.609
Robin Hood.

50:19.610 --> 50:22.769
"God, Plod must be Robin."
Cos they're keeping up with you.

50:22.770 --> 50:25.169
God, Plod must be Robin. Yeah?

50:25.170 --> 50:26.569
"We've got 503."

50:26.570 --> 50:28.769
Now, this is the critical bit.

50:28.770 --> 50:30.809
When you're
in the caravan site, you...

50:30.810 --> 50:33.849
AS BORAT: Turn off
the traction control!

50:33.850 --> 50:36.769
AS BORAT: Turn off
the traction control! Love it.

50:36.770 --> 50:39.409
"'Ow. 'Ow. 'Ow do I do that?
Whatever you want."

50:39.410 --> 50:42.690
Oh, "'Ow," you mean? "'Ow."
AS BORAT: Push the Len.

50:44.410 --> 50:47.249
AS BORAT: Push the Len. Push the Len.
It's Len Hutton.

50:47.250 --> 50:50.729
Was he a cricketer or a trade-union
leader? Trade-union leader.

50:50.730 --> 50:52.369
Was he? No, he was a cricketer.

50:52.370 --> 50:55.049
Whatever he was, it's Len.
AS BORAT: Push the Len.

50:55.050 --> 50:57.769
And then, this is
the complicated bit

50:57.770 --> 51:00.129
that we really do need to get in.

51:00.130 --> 51:03.249
AS BORAT: You have to hold it down
for ten seconds.

51:03.250 --> 51:06.369
AS BORAT: You have to hold it down
for ten seconds.

51:06.370 --> 51:09.249
Yeah. It ain't
the most riveting dialogue.

51:09.250 --> 51:10.969
It depends how you deliver it.

51:10.970 --> 51:13.729
You're in a panic -
turn off the traction control!

51:13.730 --> 51:15.650
Where's the Len?! Where's the Len?!

51:15.651 --> 51:19.210
OK, all right, let's do it.
Good. Thanks very much.

51:21.050 --> 51:24.769
'With the dialogue sorted, I went to
see my rather bruised colleague,

51:24.770 --> 51:29.609
'who was now setting up a stunt in
which the Jag would clip a caravan.'

51:29.610 --> 51:32.849
What are you doing?
Filling the caravan with petrol.

51:32.850 --> 51:36.729
Why? So it explodes
when the car hits it. Boom!

51:36.730 --> 51:38.649
Why would the caravan explode?

51:38.650 --> 51:40.689
Because I've filled it with petrol.

51:40.690 --> 51:42.729
But caravans are made from plywood,

51:42.730 --> 51:45.330
and plywood does not blow up
when you bang into it.

51:46.850 --> 51:50.169
It doesn't. They have gas bottles
in them. They would explode.

51:50.170 --> 51:52.090
See, that's what I'm replicating.

51:53.770 --> 51:55.930
Car, "Boom!" OK...

51:57.330 --> 52:00.769
Just a "Boof", OK? Just a "Boof".

52:00.770 --> 52:03.610
Yeah. But please don't go mad.

52:05.090 --> 52:06.450
No.

52:08.930 --> 52:12.089
'I then went to the other side
of the caravan park,

52:12.090 --> 52:15.089
'because a piece of equipment
called a Russian arm,

52:15.090 --> 52:19.329
'which costs £6,000 a day to rent,
had just arrived

52:19.330 --> 52:21.849
'from the set of
Spielberg's War Horse.'

52:21.850 --> 52:24.889
There it is. It's gyro stabilised,

52:24.890 --> 52:28.289
so it's smooth even if the car's
going over rough ground.

52:28.290 --> 52:31.409
So even when the car's moving along,
it can do that,

52:31.410 --> 52:33.969
which gives you
very, very dynamic shots.

52:33.970 --> 52:36.089
This is
what Hammond doesn't understand.

52:36.090 --> 52:40.002
You can use the camera
to make the chase,

52:40.003 --> 52:42.849
the real chase, exciting.

52:42.850 --> 52:46.729
You don't need to have the car going
through the air with two people

52:46.730 --> 52:49.689
out of the sunroof with MAC-10s,
shooting at the car behind.

52:49.690 --> 52:53.969
'Eventually, Hammond called to say
the caravan clip stunt was ready.

52:53.970 --> 52:57.049
'But since my pro drivers
were busy with the Russian arm,

52:57.050 --> 52:58.809
'I fired up a back-up Jag

52:58.810 --> 53:01.809
'and volunteered to do
the driving myself.'

53:04.210 --> 53:05.769
B camera.

53:05.770 --> 53:09.569
Got my own airbag here,
so if I do that, I'll be OK.

53:09.570 --> 53:15.009
Perspex in case I hit the driver's
door. Airbags are disconnected.

53:15.010 --> 53:16.730

Whoa! What the hell?!

53:46.010 --> 53:47.530
Hammond!

53:49.530 --> 53:54.209
It was supposed to be a gas bottle.
What the hell...?

53:54.210 --> 53:57.409
You blew the wrong caravan up!
You hit the wrong one!

53:57.410 --> 54:00.133
I didn't hit the wrong one,
that was the one we were supposed to...

54:00.134 --> 54:02.770
You should have labelled it!

54:03.930 --> 54:05.249
Have you any idea...?

54:05.250 --> 54:08.929
The angry man is going to see this,
he's going to see that,

54:08.930 --> 54:14.649
and then he's going to see
his £50,000 Jaguar XFR.

54:14.650 --> 54:16.969
Ooh, my lord.

54:16.970 --> 54:20.929
That wasn't supposed to happen.
He said, "Light bodywork damage..."

54:20.930 --> 54:24.249
You ripped its arse off. "... because
then Jaguar could repair it

54:24.250 --> 54:26.409
"and I don't have to pay
the full price."

54:26.410 --> 54:31.090
He's going to see what's happened
here, Hammond, wrong caravan...

54:32.250 --> 54:33.729
... this...

54:33.730 --> 54:36.010
the explosion was late...

54:38.050 --> 54:40.609
God almighty. There's the edit.

54:40.610 --> 54:44.250
How can you edit an explosion
to happen earlier than it does?

54:51.690 --> 54:57.649
You know Ray Winstone was watching
that explosion from here, OK?

54:57.650 --> 55:01.129
He's watching,
and this is not a word of a lie,

55:01.130 --> 55:03.889
that's a piece of glass
from the caravan

55:03.890 --> 55:06.290
that's penetrated this caravan.

55:08.450 --> 55:11.449
If that had hit here,

55:11.450 --> 55:14.569

I think when
the world's angriest man sees that,

57:21.050 --> 57:24.569
he's going to be quite pleased.

57:24.570 --> 57:26.649
Is he? I think so.

I know there are
one or two rough edges in it,

it has a gritty reality.

Out of bet364 adverts.

57:48.890 --> 57:52.610
There he is, rocking about
as the car lands, and I think...

57:54.970 --> 57:59.169
I think we can pat ourselves on the
back. I don't know where he is now,

57:59.170 --> 58:01.809
but he's probably regretting
his behaviour today.

58:01.810 --> 58:04.570

a personality clash. Really?

vandalism by your incompetence?

58:38.210 --> 58:40.449
He ruined my car.
You ruined his film!

58:40.450 --> 58:43.409
Can I just say, actually,
we got a call the other day,

58:43.410 --> 58:46.689
and this is absolutely true,
from a Hollywood producer

58:46.690 --> 58:50.129
who asked if we could film
a lorry chase through Moscow

58:50.130 --> 58:52.689

Seriously.

58:52.690 --> 58:55.289
But he'll change his mind
when he sees that, won't he?

58:55.290 --> 58:59.049
A-ha! You say that, but we brought
back the rushes, the raw material,

58:59.050 --> 59:03.049

59:03.050 --> 59:04.530
