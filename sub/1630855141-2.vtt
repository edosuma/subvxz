00:13.680 --> 00:16.808
Any spoken request
to leave the Silo is granted,

00:18.352 --> 00:19.811
but it is irrevocable.

00:22.648 --> 00:24.107
You have been asked to clean

00:24.107 --> 00:26.693
and have been provided
with materials to do so,

00:28.362 --> 00:30.572
but you cannot be forced into cleaning.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.325
Once outside the air lock,

00:34.159 --> 00:35.786
you are outside the law.

00:39.206 --> 00:40.666
Have you any last words?

00:43.043 --> 00:44.711
Sorry for all the fuss.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.625
<i>We do not know why we are here.</i>

01:26.503 --> 01:28.630
<i>We do not know who built the Silo.</i>

01:31.049 --> 01:35.012
<i>We do not know why everything
outside the Silo is as it is.</i>

01:40.184 --> 01:43.353
<i>We do not know when
it will be safe to go outside.</i>

01:48.233 --> 01:50.027
<i>We only know that day...</i>

01:53.280 --> 01:54.531
<i>is not this day.</i>

04:32.898 --> 04:34.149
Why'd he say it?

04:39.530 --> 04:41.907
I can't believe they're sending
the sheriff out to clean.

04:41.907 --> 04:44.785
You know, once he said it,
they didn't have any choice.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.870
But why would the sheriff wanna go out?

04:50.791 --> 04:52.167
It's happening.

04:53.502 --> 04:55.212
Oh, shit. He's coming.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.273
Oh, no.

05:19.695 --> 05:20.696
Come on.

05:24.616 --> 05:25.909
Damn it, Allison.

05:28.620 --> 05:29.788
You were right.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.056
They have to see.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.433
- How much?
- Ten.

06:31.934 --> 06:36.063
You bet ten credits he wouldn't clean?
They always clean.

06:36.063 --> 06:39.566
Can he last three minutes before
the poison gets him? That's the bet.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.967
Come on, Sheriff!

07:25.904 --> 07:27.239
What's he doing?

07:29.783 --> 07:31.910
Has anyone taken their helmet off before?

07:39.668 --> 07:40.878
Get up!

07:43.046 --> 07:44.006
Where's he going?

07:45.507 --> 07:46.884
To be with his wife.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.371
The sheriff's dead. What happens now?

08:17.915 --> 08:21.418
Fucking liar. He's a fucking liar!

08:26.507 --> 08:30.302
Hey! Cut it out!

08:31.261 --> 08:33.722
Stop now! Come on.

08:33.722 --> 08:37.433
Listen up! Everybody, calm down!
Listen up!

08:41.730 --> 08:44.608
That is fucked up, no question.

08:45.442 --> 08:48.362
But it is no excuse for us
to lose our shit.

08:48.362 --> 08:51.406
<i>If anybody's gonna fight over a sheriff
being sent out to clean,</i>

08:51.406 --> 08:53.700
<i>let them fight Up Top or in the Mids.</i>

08:54.326 --> 08:58.747
Here, in the Down Deep,
it's none of our business.

08:58.747 --> 09:01.959
Our business is keeping the lights on.

09:02.543 --> 09:03.544
<i>Yes!</i>

09:04.044 --> 09:05.754
<i>Keeping the generator running.</i>

09:05.754 --> 09:07.506
<i>Yes!</i>

09:07.506 --> 09:09.967
<i>Keeping the Silo alive!</i>

09:09.967 --> 09:12.010
<i>Yeah!</i>

09:13.136 --> 09:14.888
<i>Here in the Down Deep,</i>

09:15.973 --> 09:19.226
we'll just get shit done. Okay?

09:19.226 --> 09:20.477
Yeah!

09:21.019 --> 09:21.895
Okay?

09:24.731 --> 09:26.984
- Okay?
- Yeah!

10:01.852 --> 10:03.770
You got a message from Karins.

10:03.770 --> 10:07.357
We've been getting more alerts
about people lining up at Recycling,

10:07.357 --> 10:09.776
trying to get their hands on pipes,
hammers--

10:09.776 --> 10:11.486
Yeah. People are boneheads.

10:11.486 --> 10:12.696
Well, people are scared.

10:12.696 --> 10:16.617
Yeah, I'm gonna check in with everybody
on the radio.

10:16.617 --> 10:18.577
Do you want anything from the cafeteria?

10:18.577 --> 10:20.120
You should go home, Sandy.

10:23.707 --> 10:25.209
He really loved her.

10:26.460 --> 10:27.753
If you're wondering why.

10:30.255 --> 10:31.256
Yeah.

11:43.453 --> 11:45.080
I'm a size medium, by the way.

11:46.123 --> 11:48.041
Maybe 20 years ago.

11:50.669 --> 11:52.838
The Jensen baby's due next week.

11:52.838 --> 11:57.593
I used to be able to knock out 25
of these a year, one for every tenth kid.

11:57.593 --> 11:59.553
Now I'm lucky if I do five.

12:01.346 --> 12:03.348
- Drink?
- Yeah.

12:05.142 --> 12:07.644
Day like today,
I think we get the good stuff.

12:12.524 --> 12:14.359
Comes from before the rebellion.

12:15.277 --> 12:16.862
Maybe before everything.

12:20.324 --> 12:21.533
Thank you.

12:21.533 --> 12:22.826
To Holston Becker.

12:29.958 --> 12:32.169
You decide who you're gonna pick
for sheriff?

12:33.462 --> 12:34.755
I'm not looking at him?

12:34.755 --> 12:38.634
I'll help break in the next one,
but I'm going to retire.

12:40.886 --> 12:42.513
When Jamal was retiring,

12:42.513 --> 12:45.641
he chose Holston to be sheriff.
That was easy.

12:45.641 --> 12:47.559
If Holston had been retiring,

12:47.559 --> 12:49.645
I could've just followed his wishes,
but now...

12:49.645 --> 12:53.106
Judicial will try and slip
one of their people into the post.

12:53.607 --> 12:56.068
Holston didn't say anything to you?

13:02.074 --> 13:05.410
I've been looking through
the mayor's ledgers. I'm up to 97.

13:06.870 --> 13:12.459
Births. Deaths. How much water was used
that year. How many computer cables.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.127
Was anyone sent out?

13:15.420 --> 13:19.758
So far, not a single instance
of a mayor sending a sheriff out to clean.

13:19.758 --> 13:21.969
He went out, but you didn't send him.

13:21.969 --> 13:25.013
I didn't bring this up 'cause I feel sorry
for myself.

13:26.139 --> 13:30.894
I brought it up 'cause I don't know what
happened before these ledgers existed.

13:32.437 --> 13:34.064
Before the rebellion?

13:34.064 --> 13:36.525
Before whatever caused the rebellion.

13:38.944 --> 13:40.404
You worry it was a cleaning?

13:41.113 --> 13:44.449
- I worry about instability.
- Yeah.

13:45.742 --> 13:48.078
That's why we need
a new sheriff as soon as possible.

13:52.291 --> 13:53.917
This is the last one we've got.

13:53.917 --> 13:55.294
Thank you.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.754
I need this.

13:58.797 --> 14:01.592
- No, you're not getting it. No! You--
- No. I need this.

14:01.592 --> 14:04.136
- No, you can't have my fucking hammer!
- Hey!

14:04.136 --> 14:05.762
- Stop this shit!
- I need to protect my family!

14:05.762 --> 14:09.349
- Put the hammer down.
- Hey! Cut that shit out!

14:10.225 --> 14:12.352
Shit. Judicial.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.229
Shit.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.735
Deputy Brooks.

14:20.402 --> 14:22.821
Mr. Sims, I got this under control.

14:25.532 --> 14:26.867
Get their names.

14:31.330 --> 14:33.165
<i>Any idea when we'll get a new sheriff?</i>

14:33.832 --> 14:36.293
<i>'Cause there's still a long line
at our local Recycling,</i>

14:36.293 --> 14:39.129
<i>and the deputy asked me to make sure
we have enough ammunition.</i>

14:47.179 --> 14:48.889
<i>Level 14 is clear.</i>

15:03.195 --> 15:05.364
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

15:05.364 --> 15:07.616
It looks like you showed up in a bad mood.

15:07.616 --> 15:09.409
Now, you're taking it out on that toaster.

15:09.409 --> 15:12.162
No. I'm fixing it.

15:12.955 --> 15:15.582
You've been coming in here
since you were 13...

15:15.582 --> 15:16.542
Here we go.

15:16.542 --> 15:18.877
...to fix shit,
so you don't have to deal with shit.

15:18.877 --> 15:22.089
Can you just let me work alone, please?

15:22.089 --> 15:25.259
This have anything to do with what
you said after the sheriff cleaned?

15:26.468 --> 15:28.011
Because Shirley came by last night.

15:28.011 --> 15:31.515
She said you stormed out, yelling,
"He lied!"

15:31.515 --> 15:32.641
Don't think I was yelling.

15:34.226 --> 15:37.312
You know what? Coming in here,
sitting in that chair, using my tools,

15:37.312 --> 15:38.438
that's a privilege.

15:38.438 --> 15:42.025
And the only way you get to stay here
is by telling me what in hell's going on.

15:45.320 --> 15:46.655
Okay, then I won't stay.

15:47.990 --> 15:51.201
You didn't come here to mend a toaster.
You came here to talk.

15:52.202 --> 15:53.579
I know that's hard for you.

15:56.290 --> 15:57.708
Okay. Take your time.

16:08.302 --> 16:09.511
It's about George.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.598
It's been three months since he died.

16:14.099 --> 16:16.810
- You're saying he lied?
- No. Holston lied.

16:17.311 --> 16:19.188
- You still think George was murdered?
- Yeah.

16:19.188 --> 16:22.816
- Yeah, 'cause he didn't kill himself, so--
- How can you be so sure?

16:22.816 --> 16:24.818
'Cause the last time I saw him,

16:24.818 --> 16:26.778
<i>he really wanted to show me something.</i>

16:27.529 --> 16:29.907
<i>We were celebrating Cooper
becoming my shadow.</i>

16:30.741 --> 16:33.577
<i>George was always paranoid
'cause we weren't sanctioned,</i>

16:33.577 --> 16:34.995
<i>so he never came to these things.</i>

16:34.995 --> 16:36.205
Computer guy!

16:37.915 --> 16:39.082
They're making me get drunk.

16:39.082 --> 16:41.502
Well, it looks like you're
putting up a fight.

16:41.502 --> 16:44.630
Coop, why don't we get you some water
and a chair?

16:48.592 --> 16:49.593
Cake?

17:02.189 --> 17:05.651
Hey, everyone knows about us.
They don't give a shit.

17:05.651 --> 17:07.528
They're not gonna send us to the mines.

17:07.528 --> 17:09.530
You'd be fine down there, tough girl.

17:10.864 --> 17:13.242
Hey, something happened.

17:14.785 --> 17:15.993
Something big.

17:15.993 --> 17:18.497
I can't tell you here,
but can I speak to you after?

17:18.497 --> 17:20.040
Yeah, sure. I work until late.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.875
Then I'll tell you at your place.

17:21.875 --> 17:22.960
Okay.

17:23.544 --> 17:24.837
Everybody!

17:25.921 --> 17:27.005
Where's Coop?

17:27.005 --> 17:28.298
Get Coop up here.

17:29.383 --> 17:31.385
This is all about him. Come here.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.221
Coop, I know you're freaking the fuck out.

17:37.224 --> 17:40.477
- You are ready to shadow Jules.
- Gotta go.

17:40.477 --> 17:42.980
Let's all give it up for Cooper! Come on.

17:55.284 --> 17:58.078
<i>When I got off work at midnight,
I was exhausted.</i>

17:58.954 --> 18:00.831
<i>I was looking forward to seeing George.</i>

18:10.382 --> 18:11.383
George?

19:04.061 --> 19:05.812
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.606
Well, you don't look too hungover.

19:07.606 --> 19:09.358
I'm not. Just sad.

19:10.442 --> 19:11.276
Why?

19:12.986 --> 19:14.988
- You didn't hear?
- I just got up. Hear what?

19:14.988 --> 19:17.074
Computer George went off
the stairs last night.

19:19.535 --> 19:20.827
They're saying suicide.

19:23.539 --> 19:24.665
Did you know him well?

19:41.223 --> 19:43.809
Look, Jules,
I don't know what you want me to say.

19:44.643 --> 19:46.103
I really liked the guy.

19:46.103 --> 19:48.730
And suicide is a crime against the Silo.

19:48.730 --> 19:51.567
- I know.
- If you have proof that he didn't jump,

19:51.567 --> 19:54.111
you'd be saving me
a mountain of paperwork. But--

19:55.362 --> 19:56.488
But murder?

19:57.739 --> 20:00.033
And by who? And why?

20:00.033 --> 20:03.745
I don't know!
I just know he didn't kill himself, Hank.

20:03.745 --> 20:06.498
Okay, see, for it to be murder,
you need more than that.

20:06.498 --> 20:09.293
- You need motive and opportunity.
- Don't fucking patronize me, Hank.

20:09.293 --> 20:11.670
Hey, I'm not patronizing you, it's just...

20:15.716 --> 20:16.633
What?

20:19.511 --> 20:21.054
I know you two were...

20:22.222 --> 20:25.434
I figured, down here, who cares?
The thing is,

20:25.434 --> 20:28.520
if you were in a sanctioned relationship,
this would be easier.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.022
A partner has certain rights.

20:31.356 --> 20:32.524
Yeah. Well...

20:36.069 --> 20:37.070
Fuck it.

20:38.488 --> 20:40.115
I'll run your concerns Up Top.

20:40.115 --> 20:42.826
I'll say it came from a coworker
who knew him well.

20:42.826 --> 20:45.412
See what the sheriff has to say.
He's a good man.

20:46.288 --> 20:47.998
Nobody likes a suicide.

20:53.629 --> 20:54.630
Come on!

21:11.355 --> 21:12.564
That's her.

21:13.065 --> 21:15.025
- What's her name?
- What?

21:15.025 --> 21:17.152
What's her name?

21:17.152 --> 21:19.154
Juliette.

21:19.154 --> 21:21.031
Juliette Nichols.

21:32.751 --> 21:36.255
The body was found here,
on this ventilation unit.

21:40.342 --> 21:44.346
I'm thinking George must've fallen
maybe 100 feet, give or take.

21:44.888 --> 21:46.390
No witnesses.

21:46.390 --> 21:48.851
So, nothing much more I can give you.

21:51.019 --> 21:52.688
You seem awfully tense.

21:53.438 --> 21:55.065
I-- I'm always tense, sir.

21:56.525 --> 21:59.736
I get it. Suicide is a serious crime.

21:59.736 --> 22:02.698
- No, it wasn't suicide.
- So you've said.

22:02.698 --> 22:06.827
Yeah. He wasn't depressed.
He wasn't giving anything away.

22:06.827 --> 22:07.911
There was no sudden elation

22:07.911 --> 22:10.414
that he finally made a decision
that he would--

22:10.414 --> 22:14.001
We're all taught those signs so early,
people get good at hiding them.

22:14.501 --> 22:15.502
How'd you know him?

22:17.462 --> 22:20.299
- George--
- Everybody knows everybody down here.

22:21.008 --> 22:23.677
And George was the funny computer guy.

22:24.887 --> 22:26.346
Why do you think he was murdered?

22:26.346 --> 22:27.514
He have any enemies?

22:27.514 --> 22:28.640
I just know he--

22:28.640 --> 22:32.644
I told her, for murder,
you need motive and opportunity and--

22:32.644 --> 22:34.771
Yeah, but I told you we have opportunity.

22:34.771 --> 22:36.982
He died at 3:00 a.m?

22:37.482 --> 22:39.359
No one's on the stairs then. Right?

22:41.403 --> 22:42.946
Unless you're a porter.

22:44.031 --> 22:45.407
Or going to jump.

22:47.492 --> 22:48.869
Go to Dispatch, would you?

22:48.869 --> 22:51.496
See if there were any porters
on the stairs when it happened.

22:51.496 --> 22:52.581
- Yeah.
- Okay.

22:59.087 --> 23:01.381
That's a nice watch. Is that a relic?

23:02.591 --> 23:05.469
- It's legal.
- Just said it was nice.

23:07.971 --> 23:09.848
Look, I'm sorry about your coworker.

23:11.767 --> 23:14.436
I'm gonna go look at his body again.
Check for any signs of a struggle.

23:14.436 --> 23:15.521
Okay.

23:16.021 --> 23:19.274
Hate to ask, but maybe there's something
you'd see that I don't.

23:20.192 --> 23:21.610
But only if you're up to it.

23:24.947 --> 23:27.950
No, yeah. Of course. Yeah, sure. Cool.

23:40.838 --> 23:43.423
We're looking for anything unusual.

23:44.383 --> 23:49.137
Abrasions that wouldn't be consistent
with a fall. Evidence of a fight.

23:52.391 --> 23:54.226
- You ready?
- Yep.

24:07.030 --> 24:08.282
Some people...

24:09.324 --> 24:12.244
cut their wrists in previous attempts.

24:14.830 --> 24:16.498
Then they decide to be sure...

24:18.792 --> 24:20.294
so they jump.

24:26.258 --> 24:29.261
Even after all these years,
I haven't gotten used to the sight.

24:30.762 --> 24:32.222
- You ever seen--
- Dead person? Yeah.

24:32.222 --> 24:33.599
My brother when I was 12.

24:33.599 --> 24:37.227
My mother when I was 13. But, you know,
you knew that, so...

24:39.938 --> 24:42.191
Someone says murder, you look into them.

24:42.191 --> 24:44.401
Find out what reason
they might have for saying that--

24:44.401 --> 24:46.361
The reason is 'cause he was murdered.
That's why.

24:47.279 --> 24:50.741
But you might not wanna believe
it's suicide, given your history.

24:51.241 --> 24:53.327
That's something I can understand.

24:56.413 --> 24:57.414
Anything new?

24:58.707 --> 24:59.833
Not really.

25:00.501 --> 25:01.919
What they say at Dispatch?

25:02.544 --> 25:05.047
It was a quiet night for the porters.
Nobody up or down.

25:05.047 --> 25:06.840
- Judicial's on their way.
- Okay.

25:06.840 --> 25:09.134
Possible suicide and all,
they want a briefing.

25:09.134 --> 25:12.137
You guys ask around.

25:12.846 --> 25:14.681
See if there was anyone else
on the stairs.

25:15.265 --> 25:16.433
All right.

25:24.024 --> 25:25.359
You want something to eat?

25:25.984 --> 25:26.985
No.

25:30.280 --> 25:32.241
How long
were you and George in a relationship?

25:34.368 --> 25:35.827
I won't tell anybody.

25:36.537 --> 25:38.497
I don't know what you're talking about.

25:39.831 --> 25:41.333
Why didn't you get sanctioned?

25:46.463 --> 25:47.464
Why not?

25:49.174 --> 25:50.759
Look,
if we're gonna figure out what happened,

25:50.759 --> 25:52.386
you're gonna have to tell me the truth.

25:52.386 --> 25:54.263
When you went to my deputy
and said murder,

25:54.263 --> 25:56.306
you wanted help, right?

25:57.015 --> 25:58.642
He didn't kill himself.

25:59.351 --> 26:00.602
Okay.

26:03.981 --> 26:05.607
I gotta go meet with Judicial.

26:09.152 --> 26:10.988
Juliette, the not knowing,

26:12.573 --> 26:14.408
it's gonna haunt you forever.

26:19.955 --> 26:21.540
He left something for me.

26:23.333 --> 26:24.626
What?

26:24.626 --> 26:28.964
You being sheriff and me,
not being sheriff.

26:28.964 --> 26:32.134
I need you to promise me
you're not gonna rat me out to Judicial.

26:32.134 --> 26:33.218
Is it a relic?

26:34.261 --> 26:36.096
'Cause if it is,
I'm gonna have to confiscate it.

26:40.058 --> 26:41.852
No, he didn't leave me anything.

26:42.394 --> 26:43.395
Nothing to show you.

26:45.355 --> 26:47.107
But who's to say where I found it?

26:49.818 --> 26:51.028
The Silo's a big place.

27:24.645 --> 27:25.687
What is this?

27:26.813 --> 27:28.065
I don't know.

27:28.065 --> 27:31.068
Maybe it was his way of saying goodbye.
Giving you something.

27:35.864 --> 27:37.199
He left this with it.

27:41.328 --> 27:42.538
Where's the rest of it?

27:42.538 --> 27:44.122
That's all there was. I don't know.

27:46.124 --> 27:49.294
"Remember where you last saw this?"

27:55.676 --> 27:58.762
What I'm about to show you
is more illegal than any relic.

27:59.429 --> 28:02.641
I'm sure Up Top knows about it,
but they don't seem to care.

28:03.225 --> 28:04.810
I'm from Up Top

28:05.602 --> 28:07.437
and I have no idea where we're going.

28:16.655 --> 28:18.198
Our agreement still apply?

28:18.949 --> 28:19.950
Yeah.

28:22.619 --> 28:23.787
All right.

28:33.672 --> 28:35.632
I hope you're not afraid of the dark.

28:39.428 --> 28:40.888
Or tight spaces.

28:42.806 --> 28:43.807
Or heights.

29:13.962 --> 29:16.006
- Who did all this?
- I don't know.

29:16.715 --> 29:18.467
We think it's from before the rebellion.

29:22.221 --> 29:24.515
Hey. Careful.

29:28.268 --> 29:30.812
- What's down there?
- You'll see.

30:12.187 --> 30:13.188
Thanks.

30:15.399 --> 30:19.236
There were probably
a hundred work lights here at one time.

30:20.070 --> 30:23.115
Only these ones are left.

30:25.242 --> 30:26.451
What is that?

30:26.451 --> 30:29.746
Best guess is what's left
of the machine that dug the Silo.

30:29.746 --> 30:33.584
Theory goes, digger comes down this far,

30:33.584 --> 30:35.460
there's no easy way to get it out,

30:35.460 --> 30:41.258
so the founders just walled it off
with a 30-foot cap of concrete.

30:42.885 --> 30:47.222
Digger must have looked like this for
a hundred years.

30:47.806 --> 30:50.267
Anything of value
has been stripped a long time ago.

30:51.977 --> 30:53.937
First time I saw this place,

30:54.438 --> 30:57.274
it made me realize
how little we know about the Silo.

31:00.819 --> 31:01.904
Ready?

31:05.240 --> 31:07.242
It's better not to look down.

31:14.416 --> 31:15.334
You okay?

32:00.462 --> 32:01.880
What is this place?

32:02.422 --> 32:03.590
George.

32:04.174 --> 32:05.759
He put it all together.

32:10.055 --> 32:13.141
Last time I saw this thing was down here.

32:19.231 --> 32:20.357
Was in this box.

32:29.116 --> 32:32.828
These are why he wanted
to keep us a secret.

32:32.828 --> 32:36.206
You know, if he ever got caught with them,
he didn't want me sucked in.

32:37.624 --> 32:39.001
Are these all relics?

32:40.252 --> 32:41.253
Yeah.

32:44.298 --> 32:45.549
I don't know--

32:47.217 --> 32:48.468
Never seen this one before.

32:50.470 --> 32:52.264
Maybe it's what he wanted you to see?

32:52.264 --> 32:53.432
No idea what it is.

33:00.731 --> 33:04.651
So, George sold and traded relics?

33:04.651 --> 33:06.862
Yeah.
He was obsessed with the before time.

33:06.862 --> 33:09.948
You know, he'd come down here on his own
and he'd be looking for something.

33:09.948 --> 33:12.117
- Looking for what?
- I don't know. He never told me.

33:12.117 --> 33:13.952
He just said
that he'd know it if he saw it.

33:16.955 --> 33:17.873
That's odd.

33:19.291 --> 33:22.586
This plastic wire
used to be wrapped around the spool.

33:31.970 --> 33:33.639
Wait. Hold on.

34:18.100 --> 34:19.141
What is this?

34:53.552 --> 34:54.553
What is that?

34:59.183 --> 35:00.559
You see any of this before?

35:01.268 --> 35:02.269
No.

35:03.937 --> 35:06.398
He never mentioned this?
Said what might be on it?

35:06.398 --> 35:07.482
No.

35:10.903 --> 35:14.031
"Instructions on
how to recover deleted files."

35:17.868 --> 35:19.870
There's handwriting on the back.

35:20.746 --> 35:22.206
That's not George's handwriting.

35:24.666 --> 35:25.792
It's my wife's.

35:28.754 --> 35:30.380
Do you think your wife knew George?

35:30.923 --> 35:33.842
Allison did some IT work for him
not long before she went out.

35:36.136 --> 35:38.013
Why didn't you tell me that?

35:42.226 --> 35:44.520
If George and your w--

35:46.230 --> 35:47.689
Did you talk to him?

35:47.689 --> 35:48.899
Once.

35:53.654 --> 35:55.489
Oh, shit. The watch.

35:57.324 --> 35:58.700
You'd seen it before, hadn't you?

35:58.700 --> 36:00.536
That's why you checked his wrists.

36:01.411 --> 36:05.207
That's why you knew we were together.

36:06.750 --> 36:08.836
<i>Is that why you're here?</i>

36:08.836 --> 36:11.213
To see if I had anything to do
with why your wife went out to clean?

36:11.213 --> 36:13.090
I came down here
to determine his cause of death.

36:13.090 --> 36:15.592
Bullshit! You're wondering
if George had anything to do

36:15.592 --> 36:18.011
with why your wife went out to clean.

36:18.011 --> 36:20.764
And I'm gonna have to tell Judicial
his death was an accident.

36:20.764 --> 36:23.976
Why? Why would you do that?
He was murdered!

36:23.976 --> 36:26.061
- By who?
- I don't know by who!

36:26.061 --> 36:28.313
There's a reason why George hid this.

36:28.313 --> 36:31.233
Maybe it'll tell us why--
what happened to him.

36:31.233 --> 36:33.068
I don't know
why he hid a fucking hard drive.

36:33.068 --> 36:37.239
This is a red-level relic,
making it a threat to order in the Silo.

36:37.239 --> 36:41.034
I don't care about the order in the Silo.
I want you to do your job!

36:41.034 --> 36:43.120
Maintaining order in the Silo is my job.

36:43.120 --> 36:44.788
What about finding out the truth?

36:44.788 --> 36:48.292
I've gotta get this into the incinerator
before anyone else finds it.

36:48.292 --> 36:49.960
- No.
- That's enough!

36:52.212 --> 36:56.675
Maybe if you'd listened to your wife,
she'd still be alive right now!

37:02.222 --> 37:06.894
To get to my office,
I have to walk through the cafeteria.

37:07.895 --> 37:10.856
So, now I go to work before dawn,

37:10.856 --> 37:12.566
and I come home after dark

37:12.566 --> 37:15.068
just so I don't
have to see her body on that hill.

37:17.154 --> 37:19.531
Allison asked questions too.

37:25.704 --> 37:27.206
She was never afraid.

37:27.831 --> 37:30.125
Then please... Just...

37:31.710 --> 37:32.711
help me.

37:41.803 --> 37:43.555
I'll keep trying to find out
what happened to George,

37:43.555 --> 37:46.975
but you have to stay quiet
and you have to keep your head down.

37:46.975 --> 37:48.602
Stop wearing that watch!

37:48.602 --> 37:51.605
It may be legal, but it draws attention.

37:52.898 --> 37:55.526
When I find something, I'll send word.

37:55.526 --> 37:56.610
A signal.

37:57.152 --> 37:58.278
I promise.

37:58.278 --> 37:59.446
What kind of signal?

37:59.446 --> 38:00.989
You'll know it when you see it.

38:01.490 --> 38:03.116
Anything I can do while I wait?

38:03.116 --> 38:05.202
I have to figure out what this is,

38:05.202 --> 38:08.747
and you need to trust me.

38:12.292 --> 38:13.502
Yeah.

38:15.170 --> 38:17.464
You actually said
if he'd listened to his wife,

38:17.464 --> 38:18.841
she'd still be alive?

38:19.675 --> 38:21.802
And you wonder
why you never heard from him again.

38:23.554 --> 38:26.223
Jules, you could've told me this before.

38:26.723 --> 38:31.144
- He asked me to wait, so I waited.
- And you got no word, no sign.

38:33.730 --> 38:36.650
Well, I'm sorry you didn't get the answers
you were hoping for,

38:36.650 --> 38:38.944
but maybe you should take a day.

38:38.944 --> 38:43.198
Maybe do something. Take your mind off it.

38:44.408 --> 38:45.868
Maybe I should keep my mind on it.

38:48.203 --> 38:49.955
I didn't show the sheriff everything.

38:59.590 --> 39:01.633
Bottom half of the note George left me.

39:01.633 --> 39:03.886
"I found what I was looking for."

39:03.886 --> 39:06.138
Why didn't you show this to the sheriff?

39:06.138 --> 39:08.223
George told me
that whatever he was looking for

39:08.223 --> 39:10.058
was more dangerous than any relic.

39:10.559 --> 39:13.353
He was afraid me even knowing
about it could get me sent out.

39:13.353 --> 39:15.230
What was he looking for?

39:17.316 --> 39:19.151
Jules, this is getting dangerous.

39:24.031 --> 39:24.907
Yeah.

39:26.658 --> 39:27.868
I'll fix this later.

39:28.744 --> 39:29.953
No, you won't.

39:29.953 --> 39:31.580
Yeah. No, I won't.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.001
Okay.

39:37.294 --> 39:38.295
Hey.

39:39.546 --> 39:41.715
Try not to get yourself killed down there.

39:43.634 --> 39:44.635
Yeah.

39:55.812 --> 39:57.940
<i>I've got the judge's picks for sheriff.</i>

39:58.440 --> 39:59.775
Four mediocre candidates

39:59.775 --> 40:02.319
just to shine a light
on the one she really wants.

40:03.445 --> 40:06.073
- Paul Billings.
- I remember him. He was a deputy.

40:06.073 --> 40:07.157
Yeah, in the Mids.

40:07.157 --> 40:09.910
He was a good guy
till he abandoned us for Judicial.

40:09.910 --> 40:11.995
He got married and he wanted better hours.

40:11.995 --> 40:15.249
To be honest,
Paul Billings wouldn't be the worst.

40:15.249 --> 40:17.334
I don't want someone who's not the worst.

40:17.334 --> 40:20.629
I keep thinking any minute
someone's gonna come through that door

40:20.629 --> 40:23.507
and tell me there's an armed mob
coming up the stairs.

40:23.507 --> 40:26.677
And 140 years of peace
is gonna go down the drain.

40:27.511 --> 40:30.389
And my next thought is,
I have to go talk to Holston about this.

40:30.389 --> 40:33.642
Yeah. I think the same thing
about ten times a day.

40:34.434 --> 40:36.645
I wish he'd said who should take the job.

40:38.313 --> 40:39.690
He did.

40:43.944 --> 40:46.530
- He left a note.
- Why did you wait until now to tell me?

40:46.530 --> 40:48.782
Because it's ridiculous, and if anything,

40:48.782 --> 40:52.119
it's a sign
he wasn't quite there at the end.

40:52.703 --> 40:55.289
- Who'd he choose?
- You might wanna top off your drink.

40:58.625 --> 41:02.504
"In my final act as sheriff,
I, Holston Becker,

41:02.504 --> 41:06.758
nominate Juliette Nichols of Mechanical
as my successor."

41:06.758 --> 41:08.844
- Juliette Nichols?
- She's an engineer.

41:09.803 --> 41:12.139
"Even if she refuses,
I ask that this badge,

41:12.139 --> 41:14.892
my personal property, be given to her.
Holston Becker."

41:15.475 --> 41:16.351
Why her?

41:16.351 --> 41:19.771
Like I say,
he wasn't in his right mind at the end.

41:20.856 --> 41:21.982
I wanna meet her.

41:22.482 --> 41:23.692
Are you sure?

41:24.610 --> 41:26.778
I said meet her, not give her the job.

41:26.778 --> 41:28.739
I'll message
and have her start up tomorrow.

41:29.489 --> 41:31.408
No. I'll go to her.

41:31.408 --> 41:33.619
Oh, yeah? 144 levels?

41:34.578 --> 41:36.872
I just sent a sheriff out to clean.

41:37.831 --> 41:41.168
I need to walk the Silo.
The people need to see their mayor.

42:18.247 --> 42:19.790
<i>You've got a lot of rope.</i>

42:21.458 --> 42:22.584
Yeah.

42:24.336 --> 42:25.671
What do you need it for?

42:27.506 --> 42:28.924
To get where I'm going.

42:29.550 --> 42:30.759
Okay. Where's that?

42:32.761 --> 42:33.846
The past.

42:34.972 --> 42:36.014
The past?

42:39.184 --> 42:40.602
What are you looking for?

42:40.602 --> 42:43.230
Well, what I'm looking for isn't nearly
as important as what I've found.

42:44.898 --> 42:46.275
You.

42:46.859 --> 42:48.861
Wow. You idiot.

42:50.445 --> 42:52.281
Seriously, what are you looking for?

42:53.365 --> 42:54.908
If I find it, I'll let you know.

42:54.908 --> 42:57.995
- Tell me.
- Get off me-- Okay.

42:59.705 --> 43:00.873
I think it's a door.

43:05.169 --> 43:06.336
A door?

43:07.838 --> 43:08.964
What do you mean, a door?

43:10.007 --> 43:12.926
I saw it on an old drawing.

43:12.926 --> 43:15.053
It's at the end of a short tunnel.

43:15.053 --> 43:18.140
Well, what's behind it?
How do you even know it's real?

43:18.140 --> 43:20.100
Well, I don't know.
That's why I need to find it.

43:20.100 --> 43:22.853
It's somewhere down at the bottom.

43:24.313 --> 43:25.647
At the bottom?

43:26.148 --> 43:28.901
There's water. There's water down there.

43:28.901 --> 43:30.819
Why would anyone put a door at the bottom?

43:30.819 --> 43:34.239
- I know that the water scares you.
- Yeah, it scares me, George.

43:34.239 --> 43:36.325
'Cause you sink in water
and you can't breathe.

43:36.325 --> 43:38.827
What if you fall off the rope?

43:38.827 --> 43:41.121
What if you can't get back up again?
What if--

43:41.121 --> 43:42.372
I'm gonna be careful.

43:46.168 --> 43:47.586
Okay, make me a deal.

43:49.755 --> 43:51.006
if you're gonna go down there,

43:51.006 --> 43:54.801
I don't wanna know about it until after.

43:56.470 --> 43:57.596
Okay?

44:00.140 --> 44:01.350
Deal.

44:02.935 --> 44:04.061
Okay.

45:09.793 --> 45:10.794
Okay.

46:17.528 --> 46:18.403
No!

46:23.325 --> 46:24.326
Fuck.
