00:19.452 --> 00:21.477
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

00:21.554 --> 00:26.582
<i>Who caused this child
to walk on her own</i>

00:28.628 --> 00:30.926
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

00:30.997 --> 00:35.559
<i>Who leads her down
this treacherous road</i>

00:37.837 --> 00:40.101
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

00:40.173 --> 00:45.167
<i>She's dancing to
a song we can't hear</i>

00:47.247 --> 00:49.807
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

01:08.835 --> 01:12.236
I think one of the reasons
I live in New York is 'cause..

01:12.305 --> 01:14.500
I know my way
around New York.

01:14.574 --> 01:17.008
I don't know
my way around Paris.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.944
I, uh...

01:20.013 --> 01:24.313
don't know
my way around Denver.

01:24.384 --> 01:27.148
I don't know
my way around Maui.

01:27.220 --> 01:29.620
I don't know my way
around Toronto, etcetera.

01:29.689 --> 01:32.214
So, it's almost by default.

01:32.292 --> 01:35.227
I don't know very many people
who live in New York...

01:35.295 --> 01:38.560
who don't also say,
"But I'm leaving."

01:38.631 --> 01:43.500
And I've been thinking
of leaving...

01:43.570 --> 01:46.505
for, uh, 35 years now.

01:46.573 --> 01:48.507
I'm almost ready.

02:10.029 --> 02:12.930
<i>Last summer there
was a stretch of a couple of weeks...</i>

02:12.999 --> 02:16.457
<i>where everywhere I turned
everyone seemed to be going nuts.</i>

02:18.037 --> 02:21.837
<i>I mean, it's crazy enough
living in Brooklyn in the first place.</i>

02:21.908 --> 02:26.607
<i>But, so many weird little things
kept popping up at once.</i>

02:26.679 --> 02:29.648
<i>They all kinda got scrambled
together in my head.</i>

02:29.716 --> 02:33.709
<i>I doubt that any of it
makes sense anymore...</i>

02:33.786 --> 02:37.654
<i>but... this is how I remember it.</i>

02:46.299 --> 02:47.960
- You got it?
- I got it.

02:48.034 --> 02:52.130
Remember, okay?
Saturday the sixteenth.

02:52.205 --> 02:54.332
- Saturday the sixteenth?
- Yes.

02:54.407 --> 02:59.344
- Saturday the sixteenth?
- Saturday the sixteenth.

02:59.412 --> 03:02.643
It has to be that night.
It's got to be because it's the only night...

03:02.715 --> 03:06.276
that Ramon and his band
are playing in Brooklyn. Okay?

03:06.352 --> 03:09.617
Auggie, he's my brother.
Trust me, okay?

03:09.689 --> 03:14.058
- Don't worry, sweetheart. It's a date.
- Trust me.

03:14.127 --> 03:16.789
Thank you. Listen. Listen.

03:16.863 --> 03:19.297
You're going to be so special.

03:19.365 --> 03:22.892
Just remember the steps
I teach you. Okay?

03:22.969 --> 03:27.030
And you're going to be
like Fred "Fucking" Astaire.

03:27.106 --> 03:29.836
- Okay, Ginger. Whatever you say.
- Hey! Thief!

03:29.909 --> 03:32.377
He took my bag! Hey!

03:38.017 --> 03:40.918
He got your purse.

03:40.987 --> 03:43.182
- Thank you very much, sir.
- You okay?

03:43.256 --> 03:45.952
- I really appreciate that. Yeah. Thank you.
- All right. Good.

03:46.025 --> 03:48.653
- That was great.
- All right.

03:50.363 --> 03:54.356
Let's go call the cops,
have this little kid arrested.

03:54.434 --> 03:56.368
- Come on.
- Wait a second.

03:56.436 --> 03:58.370
We'll call from inside the store.

03:58.438 --> 04:01.305
You're gonna
have him arrested?

04:01.374 --> 04:03.308
Yeah.

04:04.477 --> 04:07.742
- No. No. No! Don't!
- How old are you?

04:07.814 --> 04:13.081
I see it in your eyes.
Me? I'm only... 12.

04:13.152 --> 04:15.518
- Come on, he's...
- Is that what you're gonna give me now, lady?

04:15.588 --> 04:17.522
No. He's scared
to death. Come on.

04:17.589 --> 04:20.286
I'm scared to death of him.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.794
- You caught him in about five seconds flat.
- I'm only 12 years old...

04:22.862 --> 04:25.956
and I only shoot people
who can't catch me, who are too old...

04:26.032 --> 04:28.592
- Come on. Come on.
- Lady. Lady!

04:28.668 --> 04:32.661
Mister, come on. I thank you for getting
it back, but let him go. He's too little.

04:32.739 --> 04:35.037
- You're not gonna press charges against him?
- No.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.076
- You're not gonna press charges against him?
- No. Look at him.

04:37.143 --> 04:40.408
- Look at him? What about him?
- He's a baby. He looks like my little brother.

04:40.480 --> 04:43.244
Sweetheart, babies are shooting people
in New York today.

04:43.316 --> 04:46.251
- Do you see a gun on him? Come on.
- Do you read the papers?

04:46.319 --> 04:48.879
- You got a gun on you?
- You're kidding me. Let him go, all right?

04:48.955 --> 04:52.049
- Bye, bye. That's it.
- This is a joke already. Let him go.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.423
- Stop it. Leave him alone, please!
- That's enough.

04:54.494 --> 04:56.894
- Let's call the cops.
- Just let him go. All right?

04:56.963 --> 04:59.295
I don't care. I don't want to
press charges. Thank you.

04:59.365 --> 05:03.324
I do appreciate getting my purse back,
but please let him go.

05:03.403 --> 05:05.701
- He's gonna be good. Look at him.
- Uh-huh.

05:05.772 --> 05:08.172
You're not gonna do
anything anymore.

05:11.210 --> 05:14.873
- Here, it's yours. It's yours.
- You're looking for trouble.

05:14.947 --> 05:18.007
- You're looking for trouble.
- Go! Go!

05:23.723 --> 05:27.215
- What are you doing?
- Why'd you do that?

05:27.293 --> 05:31.252
You shit! Look at the poor girl.
Why you do that, you fuck?

05:31.331 --> 05:34.892
Why you stand there?
Do something! You think it's funny.

05:34.967 --> 05:38.266
- It's not funny. I'm not laughing.
- How dare you do that!

05:38.338 --> 05:41.068
How dare you take my thing
and give it away like that.

05:41.140 --> 05:42.971
- Do you know what is in there?
- Lady...

05:43.042 --> 05:45.010
- Shut up!
- Lady?

05:45.078 --> 05:48.445
- What are you doing? Are you some kind of vigilante?
- If that bag is important to you...

05:48.514 --> 05:50.414
then hang onto it.

05:50.483 --> 05:53.577
- I put my life at risk to catch that kid.
- Thank you, but I have a right...

05:53.653 --> 05:56.588
- to forgive somebody and not be punished for it.
- No. You've got a respon...

05:56.656 --> 06:00.183
- Excuse me, sweetheart. Give me a minute.
- Don't talk to me like that, Auggie.

06:00.259 --> 06:03.456
- You've got a responsibility to teach that kid...
- Don't stick that in my face!

06:03.529 --> 06:05.463
- You have no right.
- Oh, lady.

06:05.531 --> 06:09.160
- Lady! Lady! What is this?
- You've got a responsibility to teach this kid right from wrong.

06:09.235 --> 06:11.897
You just taught him right from wrong?
That was right from wrong?

06:11.971 --> 06:14.201
- You just rewarded him!
- You know what you taught him?

06:14.273 --> 06:17.674
- I rewarded him? Mama!
- You gave it back to him.

06:17.744 --> 06:19.871
- Oh, God! Please!
- Come on, stop it!

06:19.946 --> 06:22.608
- I rewarded him?
- You just gave it back. What a lesson was that?

06:22.682 --> 06:27.710
- It was encouragement. Mine was a lesson of clemency.
- Clemency? Lady!

06:27.787 --> 06:30.381
- I showed him a little bit of kindness.
- This is New York!

06:30.456 --> 06:33.124
I'm scared in my own apartment.

06:33.192 --> 06:35.456
I'm, I'm... You know.

06:35.528 --> 06:39.658
I'm scared 24 hours a day,
but not necessarily in New York.

06:39.732 --> 06:43.168
I actually feel
pretty comfortable in New York.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.728
I get scared
like in Sweden.

06:46.806 --> 06:50.902
You know, it's kind of empty.
They're all drunk.

06:50.977 --> 06:53.309
Everything works.

06:53.379 --> 06:57.338
If you, you know... If you stop at a stop
light and don't turn your engine off...

06:57.417 --> 06:59.817
people come over
and talk to you about it.

06:59.886 --> 07:03.253
You open the medicine cabinet
and there'll be a poster saying...

07:03.322 --> 07:06.189
"In case of suicide, call..."

07:06.259 --> 07:09.717
You turn on the TV,
there's an ear operation.

07:09.796 --> 07:13.562
These things scare me.
New York, no.

07:13.633 --> 07:18.332
There are 2.3 million people
living in Brooklyn.

07:18.404 --> 07:21.396
There are 90 different
ethnic groups...

07:21.474 --> 07:23.704
32,000 businesses...

07:23.776 --> 07:29.305
and 1,500 churches, synagogues
and mosques in Brooklyn.

07:29.382 --> 07:32.351
There were 30,973 robberies...

07:32.418 --> 07:35.854
14,596 felonious assaults...

07:35.922 --> 07:39.119
and 720 murders
committed in Brooklyn last year.

07:40.326 --> 07:42.658
No problem, Vin.
Everything's under control.

07:42.728 --> 07:46.425
- I could run this store in my sleep.
- I know.

07:46.499 --> 07:49.696
How long you been
workin' for me, Auggie?

07:49.769 --> 07:54.832
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years.
Something like that.

07:54.907 --> 07:57.501
Kinda crazy, don't you think?
I mean, uh...

07:57.577 --> 08:02.378
a smart guy like you, what do you want
to hold onto a dead-end job like this for?

08:02.448 --> 08:04.575
I don't know.

08:04.650 --> 08:07.676
Maybe because
I love you so much, boss.

08:11.023 --> 08:13.389
I love you too.

08:15.795 --> 08:23.001
<i>The Brooklynites</i>

08:23.069 --> 08:24.627
<i>The Brooklynites, yo</i>

08:27.940 --> 08:31.239
<i>Shakes you for the truth
The three, the four, the five</i>

08:31.310 --> 08:34.211
<i>The A, 'the "C, 'the"E'
The "B-D-F'</i>

08:34.280 --> 08:37.408
<i>The "N, 'the"R'
The Queens bound "G'</i>

08:37.482 --> 08:40.418
<i>Won't you please stand clear
of the closin'doors</i>

08:40.486 --> 08:42.578
<i>Won't you please
stand clear of...</i>

08:44.056 --> 08:49.255
The Brooklyn attitude,
as far as I'm concerned, is first...

08:49.328 --> 08:52.161
knowing what you're doing,
being right...

08:52.231 --> 08:56.565
and following through and never stop
following through on what you believe in.

08:56.636 --> 09:00.197
And, uh, if
you have to defend it...

09:00.273 --> 09:05.540
physically, verbally, spiritually,
whatever way you have to defend it, is...

09:05.611 --> 09:09.377
Brooklyn people are always ready to pay
the price for what they believe in.

09:09.448 --> 09:13.384
And, um, it's being
up front and following through...

09:13.452 --> 09:16.615
and not taking
any crap from anybody.

09:16.689 --> 09:19.681
Uh, a pack of Kools, please.

09:19.759 --> 09:23.388
- What's she doing?
- I heard you, Dennis.

09:23.462 --> 09:27.262
- Huh?
- I heard you, Dennis. This is a public place.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.267
Yeah, it's a public place.
Whatever.

09:29.335 --> 09:32.600
- How you doin'?
- How you doin', Dennis?

09:32.672 --> 09:34.867
Oh, I'm good.
I'm always good.

09:34.941 --> 09:39.241
I'm glad to see
your fingers aren't broken.

09:39.312 --> 09:42.406
Wha... What the...
What's that supposed to mean?

09:42.481 --> 09:46.645
If your fingers were broken, you'd have
an excuse for not callin' Mary last night.

09:46.719 --> 09:49.313
She sat by the phone all night.
She thought somethin' happened.

09:49.388 --> 09:52.915
"Oh, maybe Dennis...
Maybe something happened." Fool!

09:52.992 --> 09:57.520
If you tell her you're gonna meet her,
you come or at least call.

09:59.332 --> 10:02.597
- Wha...
- Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about.

10:02.668 --> 10:07.571
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What are you comin' in here tellin' me...

10:07.640 --> 10:12.202
- I was hopin' I'd bump into you, to be honest.
- No, let me fin...

10:12.278 --> 10:15.839
What are you comin' in here, tellin' me
what to do with my girlfriend?

10:15.915 --> 10:17.849
- Your girlfriend?
- I think that...

10:17.917 --> 10:21.819
If you cared an ounce about Mary, you would
not let her sit there all night waiting for you.

10:21.887 --> 10:24.685
Mary and I have an understanding.
See, I work for a living.

10:24.757 --> 10:27.225
- She didn't act like she understood anything last night.
- I don't know what you do.

10:27.293 --> 10:31.457
I know what you do. You spend ten hours
a day standing around a diner, making 25...

10:31.530 --> 10:35.796
- I work for a living. I have a schedule, I have people...
- A schedule?

10:35.868 --> 10:39.565
The Knicks game's at 8:00. That means at
7:00 you're out there with the tickets.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.870
- That's a schedule?
- It's a schedule. It's a job.

10:42.942 --> 10:46.776
- It's where I have to be. It's something she understands.
- And what is this?

10:46.846 --> 10:51.146
What are you doin' even like deciding
wh-what she needs to think, what l...

10:51.217 --> 10:53.151
Wh-What are you gettin'
in my shit for?

10:53.219 --> 10:55.380
I don't give a shit
what you do with your life.

10:55.454 --> 10:58.480
- Do what you like. But leave my sister...
- Then shut up about it.

10:58.557 --> 11:01.355
- In one piece.
- Then shut up about it! Why you come in here...

11:01.427 --> 11:03.952
- These... This place... Don't touch me.
- I don't like to see my sister...

11:04.030 --> 11:09.866
How 'bout you don't touch me at all, okay?
Keep your greasy diner fuckin' fingers off me.

11:09.935 --> 11:12.426
- What?
- You know, I had...

11:12.505 --> 11:15.770
- Where do you come off?
- I spent a year listening to Phil, my good friend...

11:15.841 --> 11:19.902
You know Phil. I spent a fuckin' year
listening to him bitch about you.

11:19.979 --> 11:23.608
A year! And now you're gonna tell me
how to run my relationship?

11:23.683 --> 11:27.449
- You're gonna tell me what I should do to my girlfriend, or shouldn't do?
- I'm asking...

11:27.520 --> 11:32.355
I believe you come... Y-Y-You... Phil left you.
I think that was the case, right?

11:32.425 --> 11:35.724
- A-Am I mistaken about that?
- I don't think that was the sequence of events.

11:35.795 --> 11:39.026
I think he left... Well, no.
What was, then? What, you left him?

11:39.098 --> 11:42.625
No, I don't think so.
I don't think so! No. He left you.

11:42.702 --> 11:46.468
- You know why he left her? Frigid. Frigid.
- I'm glad you're an ex...

11:46.539 --> 11:50.600
That's why. Frigid.
Nothin'. Nothin'! Nothin'! Nothin'!

11:50.676 --> 11:52.906
- Fuck you!
- Ice bitch. Ice bitch.

11:52.978 --> 11:54.673
Fuck you, you bastard!

11:54.747 --> 11:59.047
I taught him handball, and he's my best
opponent because the score's always tied.

11:59.118 --> 12:02.519
We don't fight at home
because we fight on the court.

12:02.588 --> 12:05.250
I'm talkin' about drop-dead fights.
I won't give.

12:05.324 --> 12:08.987
I'll die. I'll fall down on that court
before I give him a point.

12:09.061 --> 12:11.325
And then he tries
to harass me on, you know.

12:11.397 --> 12:14.059
He said, "Oh! Now," he said,
"I'm gonna get serious."

12:14.133 --> 12:17.125
And every time he does that,
I kick his butt.

12:17.203 --> 12:20.536
What the fuck you come in here
doin' this shit for?

12:20.606 --> 12:23.700
These are my friends. You're telling
him how to run his business!

12:23.776 --> 12:27.542
These are my friends. What the hell
you comin' in here tellin' my friends...

12:27.613 --> 12:30.844
- Dennis, come on.
- No! Fuck you. Fuck you!

12:30.916 --> 12:34.477
- All right, I'll just go out.
- Just forget about it.

12:34.553 --> 12:37.681
- What we... What were you yelling about?
- Is that what this is about?

12:37.757 --> 12:41.784
- You guys sit around here and talk all day this trash?
- Nah. No.

12:41.861 --> 12:44.887
I'm sorry. I started it.
Believe me, I know I started it.

12:44.964 --> 12:46.693
- Nobody talks about you.
- Hmm.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.257
Wh-What were you
yelling about?

12:50.936 --> 12:54.736
- Things we shouldn't've been yelling about.
- You want a hug?

12:54.807 --> 12:56.866
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

13:03.482 --> 13:05.973
Get right in there, Jimmy.

13:07.186 --> 13:09.677
- Do you feel better?
- Yeah, a lot better.

13:09.755 --> 13:12.747
- You're not rigid anymore?
- No, no. Not rigid.

13:12.825 --> 13:15.851
I get rigid sometimes.

13:15.928 --> 13:18.158
Yeah.

13:18.230 --> 13:22.064
Like the Indian over there.

13:22.134 --> 13:26.594
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I, I stand over there, get rigid.

13:26.672 --> 13:28.839
Auggie says that, uh...

13:28.908 --> 13:31.376
He says that first of all, you...

13:31.443 --> 13:33.911
He says first of all,
you like somebody.

13:33.979 --> 13:36.777
And, um, and then
you kiss 'em.

13:36.849 --> 13:40.580
Then after you kiss 'em,
uh, you do the dirty.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.986
Yeah. Yeah, doin' the dirty.

13:44.056 --> 13:47.423
Yeah. He says,
and after that, uh...

13:47.493 --> 13:50.121
then you find out if, uh,
you can fall in love with 'em.

13:50.196 --> 13:53.563
And if you fall in love with 'em,
you marry somebody else.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.827
Hey. Hey!

13:56.902 --> 13:58.836
- Hey, Dot.
- Hi.

13:58.904 --> 14:01.702
- How are you, kid?
- Well, I'm just great. I'm just great.

14:01.774 --> 14:06.438
Can I have gum?
Everything's real fuckin' great.

14:06.512 --> 14:09.106
What brings you
to sunny Brooklyn?

14:09.181 --> 14:12.617
I just drove in. I wanted to talk to ya,
if I can talk to ya.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.915
Can I talk to ya?
Do you have a minute?

14:14.987 --> 14:18.548
- You caught me at a bad time. I'm taking inventory.
- Ooh, a minute.

14:18.624 --> 14:22.025
A minute.
I'm so fucking pissed off!

14:22.094 --> 14:25.552
Goddamn it, I'm so fucking
pissed off at Vinny. I just...

14:25.631 --> 14:29.533
I just wanted to talk to you about it.
I don't know why I want to talk to you about it.

14:29.602 --> 14:31.661
But you know him.
I don't know.

14:31.737 --> 14:34.865
- I don't know him.
- What happened?

14:34.940 --> 14:38.000
He just drives me out of my
fuckin' mind. You know what I mean?

14:38.077 --> 14:41.706
He promised me that he was gonna take me to
Las Vegas. You heard about that and everything.

14:41.780 --> 14:46.114
Then at the last minute
of course, another time, he pulls out.

14:46.185 --> 14:50.121
And he says, "We're gonna postpone it."
Or cancel it. Whatever the fuck he said.

14:50.189 --> 14:54.785
- But I'm not goin'. He's not goin' with me, anyway.
- Yeah?

14:54.860 --> 14:58.523
And I'm mad because
I was looking forward to it.

14:58.597 --> 15:01.361
I really wanted to go.
I've been wanting to go my whole life.

15:01.433 --> 15:04.425
But instead of being able to go there,
what did I do? I sat there washing dishes...

15:04.503 --> 15:09.031
making tuna fish casserole for 15 years,
and I don't get to go to Las Vegas.

15:09.108 --> 15:11.338
And I'm pissed,
and I can't get on this chair!

15:11.410 --> 15:13.776
Dot, baby, he must've had
a good reason for canceling.

15:13.846 --> 15:16.007
He doesn't have a good reason.
There is no good reason.

15:16.081 --> 15:18.447
There's a million reasons,
but none of them are good.

15:18.517 --> 15:21.748
I need to have some excitement.
I wanted to go...

15:21.820 --> 15:25.517
you know, where there's things
happening at night...

15:25.591 --> 15:27.650
after 6:00.

15:27.726 --> 15:31.093
- How about your bed?
- Ha.

15:31.163 --> 15:34.064
- Like I said, that's why
I want to go to Las Vegas.

15:34.133 --> 15:36.567
- Come on!
- Come on? You don't know.

15:36.635 --> 15:40.036
- So the guy, one time he broke a promise.
- It isn't one time!

15:40.105 --> 15:43.199
It's every time.
It's 15 years' worth of times.

15:43.275 --> 15:46.176
It's not one time. If it was one time,
do you think I'd be this upset?

15:46.245 --> 15:49.544
If it was one time, I'd be like,
"Oh, that's okay. That's okay, Vinny."

15:49.615 --> 15:53.915
But it's always.
We never do anything fun!

15:53.986 --> 15:55.920
I'm a fun girl.

15:59.992 --> 16:04.292
- Can I really talk to you? I mean, really talk to you?
- Of course, Dot.

16:04.363 --> 16:07.560
- Well, he's a... I don't know.
- Whoa. Whoa.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.227
- Hey, Violet. How are you?
- Hi, Dot.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.270
- Hi.
- You know Dot. Dot, Violet.

16:12.338 --> 16:15.034
- Yeah. Hi, Violet.
- Hi, Dot.

16:15.107 --> 16:18.008
- What's doin', baby?
- Well, I come... You make it clearer, okay?

16:18.077 --> 16:20.409
I come to tell you
that Saturday night...

16:20.479 --> 16:24.074
you and me, chicky-chicky,
dancey-dancey, remember, okay?

16:24.149 --> 16:27.915
You're goin' dancin', huh?
Well, don't cancel.

16:27.987 --> 16:31.514
- I'll see you later.
- Okay, listen. Listen, just...

16:31.590 --> 16:33.683
- Don't cancel, though. Don't let him cancel.
- We don't cancel.

16:33.759 --> 16:37.320
- He don't cancel with me.
- Vinny doesn't cancel either. Vinny's not...

16:37.396 --> 16:40.126
Don't gimme your shit. I'll see you later.

16:40.199 --> 16:44.499
- All right. Be good.
- Yeah.

16:44.570 --> 16:47.539
- What are you doin', gorgeous?
- How are you?

16:47.606 --> 16:50.769
Nice to see you, baby.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.676
So, you and I go
dancey-dancey, okay?

16:53.746 --> 16:56.579
- Saturday night.
- Saturday night?

16:56.648 --> 16:58.878
Yeah.

16:58.951 --> 17:01.784
Not this Saturday night.
You mean the Saturday night after.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.253
Bullshit, Auggie. Bullshit!

17:04.323 --> 17:08.020
- Oh! What are you doin'?
- What are you doing to me?

17:08.093 --> 17:10.584
Don't do that.
He's gotta sweep the floor.

17:10.662 --> 17:15.598
Auggie, you say Saturday night. Don't bullshit
me. What kind of number you tryin' to pull?

17:15.666 --> 17:18.363
You say the sixteenth.
We say the sixteenth, okay?

17:18.436 --> 17:20.871
I planned the whole night.

17:20.939 --> 17:23.499
Jesus! Is there something in the air?
What's the matter with you?

17:23.575 --> 17:26.738
Dotty's upset.
You're upset. About what?

17:26.811 --> 17:29.838
- What's in your ear?
- That's my music.

17:31.250 --> 17:35.209
Listen, sweetheart.
Saturday night, um...

17:37.656 --> 17:40.819
Saturday night
I promised Tommy...

17:40.893 --> 17:43.589
I'd clean out
his brother's apartment with him.

17:43.662 --> 17:47.928
His brother, um,
his brother Chuck.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.733
We were... in the Navy
together, and he died.

17:54.339 --> 17:56.807
- You understand?
- I don't know what you're talking about, okay?

17:56.875 --> 18:00.777
Chuck. Chuck.
Who the fuck is Chuck?

18:00.846 --> 18:04.179
No, who the fuck was Chuck?
Chuck is dead.

18:04.249 --> 18:07.776
Chuck's the guy
I was in the Navy with and he died.

18:07.853 --> 18:13.120
You... are two-timing me,
ain't you, baby? Come here.

18:13.192 --> 18:15.126
- Two-timing you?
- Come here. Yes.

18:15.194 --> 18:20.097
- You're too beautiful to two-time.
- Who is it? Dot? Sally?

18:20.165 --> 18:23.464
Oh, I know. I know.

18:23.535 --> 18:26.868
It's the little waitress
with the fat culo, isn't it?

18:26.939 --> 18:29.499
You give me more credit
than I deserve, doll.

18:29.575 --> 18:32.373
No, no. I would never two-time you.
What's the matter with you?

18:32.444 --> 18:36.744
I love you. Come on, stop. Stop.

18:58.170 --> 19:02.470
You lied to me, Augusto.

19:02.541 --> 19:04.839
And people who lie...

19:04.910 --> 19:08.073
don't deserve no love.

19:09.548 --> 19:12.642
You mess with Violeta.

19:12.718 --> 19:16.176
And Violeta fight back.

19:25.330 --> 19:31.235
I rip your guts out, Auggie...

19:31.303 --> 19:33.430
like a tiger.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.871
Like a fucking tiger...

19:35.941 --> 19:37.932
with teeth...

19:41.680 --> 19:46.117
as sharp as the razor blades.

19:51.056 --> 19:53.752
Don't fuck with me.

19:53.825 --> 19:55.918
L- Is a Brooklyn girl
a good fighter?

19:55.994 --> 19:59.157
Of course. 'Cause we don't
scratch and pull hair.

19:59.231 --> 20:03.395
We fight like guys, fist to fist.
You know what I'm sayin'?

20:03.468 --> 20:06.164
And if we can't beat
the other girl, we'll use...

20:06.238 --> 20:08.934
a garbage can or a bottle
or anything.

20:09.007 --> 20:11.134
Do I have a boyfriend?
Yeah.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.144
He's a roughneck, though.

20:13.212 --> 20:17.546
But he's not like me. He don't like
lookin' at stuff and chillin' out.

20:17.616 --> 20:23.452
He wanna go smoke weed
and drink forties all day and...

20:23.522 --> 20:28.960
That's all he does. I mean, I think
he smokes a pound of weed a day.

20:29.027 --> 20:34.693
He's my boyfriend, but I'm gonna change him
because he got too much Brooklyn in him.

20:48.647 --> 20:50.581
Pack of Luckys?

20:50.649 --> 20:53.743
You know what? No.

20:53.819 --> 20:56.583
I'll tell you what.
I've got one cigarette left...

20:56.655 --> 20:59.681
and I decided I was
gonna come here, I'm gonna quit.

20:59.758 --> 21:02.226
But I wanted
to smoke this with you.

21:02.294 --> 21:06.253
So I thought, you know,
"Last cigarette, smoke it with Auggie."

21:06.331 --> 21:08.492
- In fact... Hey, Jimmy.
- You're kidding me? I'm touched.

21:08.567 --> 21:12.560
Would you take a picture of me
and Auggie with my last cigarette?

21:12.638 --> 21:15.266
- You just push this.
- Yeah.

21:15.340 --> 21:17.865
- This is it, man.
- All right.

21:17.943 --> 21:21.401
- Where do you want me to stand?
- I don't know.

21:21.480 --> 21:24.278
- Think you could come over here?
- All right.

21:25.384 --> 21:28.842
- Yeah. You just push this.
- This one?

21:28.920 --> 21:31.354
No, this one.

21:31.423 --> 21:33.914
- All right?
- Yeah.

21:33.992 --> 21:36.790
- Bob, you know...
- The last cigarette... with Auggie.

21:36.862 --> 21:39.729
I'm touched you would want
to smoke your last cigarette with me.

21:39.798 --> 21:44.565
Twelve years I come in here. Luckys.
Wait, Jimmy. Your finger's in front.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.070
All right.

21:49.141 --> 21:52.076
- All right. Thanks, man.
- Good. You got it, Jimmy.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.942
Good. Okay. You got it.

21:55.013 --> 21:59.211
Thanks. So this is it.
One more cigarette.

21:59.284 --> 22:02.811
I remember
my first cigarette, man.

22:02.888 --> 22:07.188
These friends of mine, they stole cigarettes
from this store, Beeler's Pharmacy.

22:07.259 --> 22:11.195
I still remember. It was like a suburb
of Akron, Ohio where I grew up.

22:11.263 --> 22:15.063
So we walked home along
the railroad tracks. Opened the pack.

22:15.133 --> 22:18.034
I still remember.
It was like a pack of Newports.

22:18.103 --> 22:22.597
We smelled 'em first. You know,
that menthol. It smelled like candy.

22:22.674 --> 22:26.337
Then we lit 'em up.
We started inhaling, coughing.

22:26.411 --> 22:29.380
- A couple minutes later,
we're sick, nauseous, dizzy.

22:29.448 --> 22:31.643
- But we felt so cool. You know?
- Yeah.

22:31.717 --> 22:34.618
Real bad-ass
ten-year-old kids smokin'.

22:34.686 --> 22:38.383
But sex and cigarettes, man,
you gotta admit.

22:38.457 --> 22:42.757
- That's one thing I'm really gonna miss, having a cigarette.
- Sex?

22:42.828 --> 22:45.626
- Well...
- You giving up sex also because you can't smoke afterwards?

22:45.697 --> 22:49.098
Maybe, you know, if...
l- I've never had a girlfriend who didn't smoke.

22:49.167 --> 22:52.261
Maybe that means if I quit,
I'll never have sex again. I don't know.

22:52.337 --> 22:55.306
But having a cigarette
after sex, that's like...

22:55.374 --> 22:59.140
A cigarette never tasted like that, you know?
Share a cigarette with your lover.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.509
- That's bliss.
- That I'm gonna miss.

23:01.580 --> 23:04.413
Also with coffee.
Coffee and cigarettes, you know?

23:04.483 --> 23:06.451
That's like
breakfast of champions.

23:06.518 --> 23:09.681
- Hey, my man. Hey.
- What's happenin'?

23:09.755 --> 23:12.053
Want some coffee?

23:12.124 --> 23:14.786
Don't get lint
on your outfit.

23:14.860 --> 23:16.919
Lint? No, I hate lint.
Lint ain't no good for me.

23:16.995 --> 23:18.929
- Let me ask you somethin'.
- What do you want to ask me?

23:18.997 --> 23:22.194
I got a job interview
at 209-1/2...

23:22.267 --> 23:26.670
See, man. Is there any nurses
livin' in the neighborhood?

23:26.738 --> 23:29.104
Nurses? There's a hospital
five blocks up on the left-hand side.

23:29.174 --> 23:31.699
I just came out
of the hospital.

23:31.777 --> 23:33.745
You need to go back
to the hospital, get that redressed.

23:33.812 --> 23:36.940
- No. It just got dressed.
- It don't look like it just got dressed.

23:37.015 --> 23:41.076
- What day is this?
- Today? It's Wednesday.

23:41.153 --> 23:43.087
- Wednesday.
- What are you lookin' for?

23:43.155 --> 23:47.922
- I'm lookin' for 209-1/2...
- This is 211. 209's across the street.

23:47.993 --> 23:49.927
- Half is in between. Right in that crack.
- You're wrong.

23:49.995 --> 23:53.260
This is 209. 209 ain't across the street.
208 is across the street.

23:53.331 --> 23:57.062
209's here, 211 's here. So 209-1/2
is in between these two buildings.

23:57.135 --> 24:00.332
I don't need no information from you.
You don't know nothin'.

24:00.405 --> 24:03.772
This is Brooklyn. You don't go by
numbers. What are you lookin' for?

24:03.842 --> 24:07.437
I'm lookin' for $4.95
to get a Belgian waffle.

24:07.512 --> 24:10.242
Ah! You're lookin'
for $4.95.

24:10.315 --> 24:13.113
- Is that a work of art or what?
- That's beautiful.

24:13.185 --> 24:15.745
They don't make those anymore.
Obsolete.

24:15.821 --> 24:19.382
You can't get that.
You better go home to mama and get that.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.619
It looks pretty good actually.

24:38.343 --> 24:40.277
Brooklyn has everything.

24:40.345 --> 24:45.282
It has little, little, uh, rivers runnin'
through it. People don't know it.

24:45.350 --> 24:48.808
It has waterfalls in it,
and they don't know where it's at.

24:48.887 --> 24:51.583
And, uh, it's just fantastic.

24:51.656 --> 24:54.420
It's a big, beautiful borough.
It has everything.

24:54.493 --> 24:59.624
Flatlands, highlands,
lowlands, wooded land.

24:59.698 --> 25:01.632
And even swamps.

25:01.700 --> 25:05.329
When you look at the other boroughs
and compare them all...

25:05.403 --> 25:11.035
Brooklyn is larger and is the hippest
of all of the boroughs.

25:11.109 --> 25:12.906
I'll meet you there, then.

25:12.978 --> 25:17.415
Check it out. I got the clocks,
the watches. I don't deal in Swatches.

25:17.482 --> 25:20.280
Seiko, Casio, Timex, Rolex.

25:20.352 --> 25:24.448
What do you need when you have sex?
The latex. Don't forget. How you doin', man?

25:24.523 --> 25:27.083
- I got it all.
- I'll take the whole batch.

25:27.158 --> 25:29.456
- You like my sales pitch?
- Not bad, man.

25:29.528 --> 25:32.088
- What you sellin', my man?
- I got a good deal for you today.

25:32.163 --> 25:35.758
- For you, Mr. Brooklyn Cigar Company...
- What've you got?

25:35.834 --> 25:40.100
- I got $20 and $25 prices.
- Twenty and $25?

25:40.171 --> 25:43.698
I've got the African price, I've got
the European price. Which one you want?

25:43.775 --> 25:46.903
- African price or European price. Show me something nice.
- What does that mean?

25:46.978 --> 25:49.811
Take a look. I'll get to
what that means in a minute.

25:49.881 --> 25:52.247
I'm dealing
with the African first.

25:52.317 --> 25:54.080
Black people first, always.

25:54.152 --> 25:57.053
- Rolex.
- Rolex, baby. It's the real deal lizard skin.

25:57.122 --> 26:01.081
- Where'd you get this?
- Don't you worry yourself about that, baby.

26:01.159 --> 26:03.684
I got the goods.
You ain't got to worry about that.

26:03.762 --> 26:08.096
You're gonna sell this Rolex
for 20, 25, 30, 40, 50? What is it?

26:08.166 --> 26:10.999
- African price... $25.
- What does that mean, African price?

26:11.069 --> 26:13.003
I'm not from Africa.

26:13.071 --> 26:18.338
There are 872,702
African Americans.

26:18.410 --> 26:21.504
412,906 Jewish people.

26:21.580 --> 26:26.279
462,4ll Hispanic people
livin' in Brooklyn.

26:26.351 --> 26:28.785
There ain't one black person
even hangin' around this neighborhood.

26:28.853 --> 26:33.256
- What're you doing here, man?
- My name is Tommy Fennili. That's my name.

26:33.325 --> 26:36.294
Tommy Fennili.
Oh, yo! Tommy Fennili.

26:36.361 --> 26:40.161
Are you from Brooklyn or somethin'?
This guy! Please, guys!

26:40.231 --> 26:43.962
Why you hangin' out in this neighborhood?
Crown Heights, Howard Beach.

26:44.035 --> 26:45.935
- We're in Brooklyn, man. Brooklyn!
- This is my neighborhood.

26:46.004 --> 26:49.269
- West Side, do or die. That's where I'm from.
- This is my neighborhood.

26:49.341 --> 26:52.936
- Your neighborhood. How'd you get the name Fennili?
- I'm from Italy.

26:53.011 --> 26:55.571
- From Italy?
- My father's Italian, my mother's black.

26:55.647 --> 26:59.708
You ain't even... What's that?
Mulatto? You ain't no mulatto.

26:59.784 --> 27:02.218
- You're as black as me, man.
- Hey, hey. Come on.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.619
Wait. How do you know
what I am?

27:04.689 --> 27:06.884
- I'll tell you this, black man.
- You're assuming.

27:06.958 --> 27:09.722
- I'll tell you this, black man. I'll tell you this, my brother.
- No. Wait a minute.

27:09.794 --> 27:12.854
My brother Fennili,
I'll tell you this.

27:12.931 --> 27:15.297
- Calm down. Get real with me. Talk to me.
- Excuse me.

27:15.367 --> 27:19.269
- I'm gonna take a seat over here.
Hold up. Hold up. Hold up.

27:19.337 --> 27:21.396
- He's not gonna buy one.
- Chill, chill, chill. Excuse me, sir.

27:21.473 --> 27:24.169
Timex, Rolex,
Casio, Seiko.

27:24.242 --> 27:26.904
Whatever you want,
I got it for yo.

27:26.978 --> 27:29.037
- Yo. Come on, man. I'm tryin' to sell these.
- Hey, Vinny.

27:29.114 --> 27:31.309
I'm trying to sell these
watches. The problem is...

27:31.383 --> 27:33.476
I'm trying to sell these
watches 'cause I'm really a rapper.

27:33.551 --> 27:36.145
That's my thing. I rap. Y'all like rap
music? You probably don't like it.

27:36.221 --> 27:38.815
- You're a rapper?
- You probably ain't into rap music either.

27:38.890 --> 27:41.324
I'm trying to get some equipment.
You wanna buy a watch?

27:41.393 --> 27:45.056
- My heart is heavy with song.
- What?

27:45.130 --> 27:49.396
<i>- I got a feeling called a blue-ue lonesome
- Oh, God.</i>

27:49.467 --> 27:52.732
<i>- Since my baby said good-bye
- Oh, no.</i>

27:52.804 --> 27:56.865
<i>And Lord, I don't know
what I'd do-o-o</i>

27:56.941 --> 28:01.241
<i>- All I do is sit and sigh-igh - Hold on.
What's up with... What're you, Puerto Ricans?</i>

28:01.312 --> 28:05.146
You black. Playin' Billy Ray Cyrus.
What's up with this neighborhood?

28:05.216 --> 28:09.050
- Billy Ray who?
- Y'all wanna be white. That's the problem.

28:09.120 --> 28:12.214
- Playin' that... Whatever that is.
- What do you want to hear?

28:12.290 --> 28:14.315
- This guy is good.
- Where're you from?

28:14.392 --> 28:16.860
- Bed-Stuy.
- He doesn't know where he's from.

28:16.928 --> 28:20.762
I was from Africa. But in case you didn't
remember, they stole us from Africa.

28:20.832 --> 28:22.925
- Black man Fennili.
- I got a Bed-Stuy too.

28:23.001 --> 28:25.663
I stole you from Africa?
Can I give you back?

28:31.209 --> 28:34.838
I couldn't have been
unhappier...

28:34.913 --> 28:38.280
in the eight years I spent
growing up in Brooklyn.

28:38.349 --> 28:40.749
But I say that, uh...

28:40.819 --> 28:43.515
not having realized what it would
then be like being on Long Island...

28:43.588 --> 28:45.715
which was infinitely worse.

28:45.790 --> 28:49.920
And if there was probably
a childhood trauma that I had...

28:49.994 --> 28:52.121
other than
the Dodgers leaving Brooklyn...

28:52.197 --> 28:57.726
which if you think about it is a reason
why some of us are imbued with a cynicism...

28:57.802 --> 29:01.533
that we never recovered from,
obviously you're not a Mets fan...

29:01.606 --> 29:03.801
and you can't possibly be
a Yankee fan.

29:03.875 --> 29:06.901
So baseball's eliminated
from your life...

29:06.978 --> 29:09.378
because of being born
in Brooklyn.

29:09.447 --> 29:13.406
- You cared about the Dodgers as a kid?
- Very much.

29:13.485 --> 29:15.715
I don't know why.
I don't like baseball.

29:15.787 --> 29:18.950
Of course, maybe I don't like baseball
because the Dodgers aren't here anymore.

29:19.023 --> 29:21.583
These days if you said the Dodgers,
no one knows what you're talking about.

29:21.659 --> 29:25.925
They think you're talking about Los Angeles.
And I don't mean the Los Angeles Dodgers.

29:25.997 --> 29:30.297
But, uh, Long Island was terrible.

29:30.368 --> 29:32.302
Absolutely terrible.

29:32.370 --> 29:35.464
I mean, at least Brooklyn
you could walk around.

29:35.540 --> 29:37.531
- I'm from Brooklyn, man.
- Just relax.

29:37.609 --> 29:39.770
- You got some Brooklyn tune?
- Yeah.

29:52.157 --> 29:56.457
<i>Arriba.! Arriba.!</i>

29:56.528 --> 29:59.861
I told you, right? Hey!

30:12.744 --> 30:15.679
- Here you go.
- Yeah, man.

30:17.849 --> 30:27.357
<i>Smoke Sen-Sen
Smoke, smoke</i>

30:31.095 --> 30:33.154
- Let me hold it a second.
- Oh, you play?

30:33.231 --> 30:35.529
- Yeah, man.
- Sells watches. Plays.

30:35.600 --> 30:38.501
That's right. Gotta hustle.
Told you.

30:42.574 --> 30:47.176
Yee-hah!

30:47.245 --> 30:50.237
<i>Check it, check it Check it out
Come buy my watches</i>

30:50.315 --> 30:53.807
<i>I got the clock
I got the time I got the rhyme</i>

30:53.885 --> 30:56.149
<i>Black man, black man
You're outta your mind</i>

30:56.221 --> 30:58.621
<i>Sittin' over here
on your black behind</i>

30:58.690 --> 31:01.124
<i>Sittin' in the chair
White man over there</i>

31:01.192 --> 31:03.456
<i>Stares at me
without a care</i>

31:03.528 --> 31:07.464
<i>I know you don't care but
it's like... Oh, yo. Whatever, man.</i>

31:07.532 --> 31:10.296
My favorite thing
about Brooklyn is...

31:10.368 --> 31:13.496
that every nationality
in the world is in Brooklyn.

31:15.273 --> 31:18.731
The least favorite thing is that
all of these nationalities...

31:18.810 --> 31:22.405
we have not
been able to get along.

31:22.480 --> 31:27.644
There are 3,268,121...

31:27.719 --> 31:29.846
potholes in Brooklyn.

31:29.921 --> 31:33.448
You know, I think a lot of people start
smokin' because it's glamorized...

31:33.524 --> 31:35.754
like Hollywood
and the movies, you know?

31:35.827 --> 31:41.595
You see Marlon Brando,
you see James Dean smokin' a cigarette.

31:41.666 --> 31:45.295
- Marlene Dietrich.
- That's how I started smoking. I started smokin' 'cause...

31:45.370 --> 31:49.636
when I was a boy, a teenager, I saw this
great movie called A Walk in the Sun.

31:49.707 --> 31:51.402
- You ever see it?
- No.

31:51.476 --> 31:53.876
Richard Conte, um...

31:53.945 --> 31:56.709
Oh. Who was the other guy?
I forget his name. Anyway...

31:56.781 --> 32:00.148
they're on the campaign in Europe,
it's World War II and they're in the army.

32:00.218 --> 32:04.177
Richard Conte's a machine gunner and he has
his assistant who carries bullets and all that.

32:04.255 --> 32:08.282
Or he carries the machine gun. As they're
walkin' down the road on to the next battle...

32:08.359 --> 32:12.352
Richard Conte would be philosophizing
about life and he'd go, "Butt."

32:12.430 --> 32:17.231
He never had any cigarettes, and his partner
would always go... And give him a cigarette.

32:17.302 --> 32:20.135
And somehow, the way Richard Conte
would be walkin' in the sun...

32:20.204 --> 32:23.605
carryin' a machine gun
and go, "Butt,"

32:23.675 --> 32:25.438
it made me want to smoke.

32:25.510 --> 32:27.876
- I used to do it to my friends in the pool room.
- Yeah?

32:27.946 --> 32:31.313
I go..."Butt." They go,
"Get the fuck outta here. Butt."

32:31.382 --> 32:34.112
Speakin' of movies,
I was thinkin' too, this is unrelated...

32:34.185 --> 32:37.916
but I was watchin' TV
the other night...

32:37.989 --> 32:40.719
and in Japan and
there was some movie on.

32:40.792 --> 32:43.989
Why is it in every movie
there's a shootout...

32:44.062 --> 32:46.690
and when they run out
of bullets, they like "click, click."

32:46.764 --> 32:50.530
They fling the gun away like it's
a disposable cigarette lighter.

32:50.601 --> 32:54.264
What's up with that? Guns cost a lot
of money. Can't you reload it?

32:54.339 --> 32:58.298
You know what I'm saying? They always
like... click. They throw the gun out.

32:58.376 --> 33:01.834
- That's a good point.
- Another thing in movies I think is really weird.

33:01.913 --> 33:04.643
Like war movies.
Nazis in movies?

33:04.716 --> 33:09.653
- Why do they always smoke
in some weird way like this?

33:09.721 --> 33:12.417
We have ways
of making you talk, Auggie.

33:12.490 --> 33:17.223
Stop! It's like the threat of...
you know, burn torture.

33:17.295 --> 33:19.593
Or it's like this.

33:19.664 --> 33:23.430
Yeah. We know who you are.
We have seen what you've done.

33:23.501 --> 33:26.095
The fucked up thing
is like you go to Hollywood now...

33:26.170 --> 33:30.539
they got us hooked on cigarettes,
you know, this image of glamour.

33:30.608 --> 33:32.940
You go out there now,
you can't smoke anywhere.

33:33.011 --> 33:36.071
You light up after a meal
in a restaurant.

33:36.147 --> 33:40.743
They come over. "I'm sorry, sir.
Smoking's prohibited by law in restaurants."

33:40.818 --> 33:43.252
What's up with that?
They get you started, you know?

33:44.889 --> 33:48.154
- A butt.
- What happened to the one I just gave you?

33:48.226 --> 33:51.252
I sent it home. They're cutting down
on the butts at home.

33:51.329 --> 33:53.263
A butt!

33:54.732 --> 33:57.064
A match.

33:57.135 --> 34:01.003
Thanks.
Pays to have friends.

34:01.072 --> 34:04.838
Yes, I'm smoking cigarettes
and many of my friends have died of it.

34:04.909 --> 34:07.707
On the other hand,
while I am smoking cigarettes...

34:07.779 --> 34:12.909
I am not downing a bottle
of Scotch... in 15 minutes.

34:12.984 --> 34:16.112
So looked at from that point of view,
it's a health tool.

34:16.187 --> 34:19.520
I can't remember the first time
I had a cigarette.

34:19.590 --> 34:21.524
I can remember the first time
I had a thing...

34:21.592 --> 34:24.083
you would know 'cause you're from
Brooklyn, called a punk.

34:24.161 --> 34:29.998
Do you remember a punk?
Punk was this long, green piece of wood.

34:30.068 --> 34:33.799
It was a slim piece of wood,
this big, dyed green...

34:33.871 --> 34:36.032
with God knows what
caked on it...

34:36.107 --> 34:39.099
about three inches down
all the way to the end.

34:39.177 --> 34:41.577
You lit it
and pretended to smoke it.

34:41.646 --> 34:44.513
Of course you couldn't inhale it
because it's solid wood.

34:44.581 --> 34:48.712
And you'd walk around with it.
It was called a punk.

34:48.786 --> 34:51.583
Am I right?
That I can remember.

34:51.656 --> 34:54.716
When that turned into
an actual Marlboro...

34:54.792 --> 34:57.818
uh, I honestly don't recall.

34:57.895 --> 35:03.197
It's... It, along with most of my childhood
memories, are not available to me.

35:03.267 --> 35:07.328
My childhood was so unpleasant that I
absolutely don't remember anything, I think...

35:07.405 --> 35:10.431
before, uh, age 31.

35:21.619 --> 35:24.782
- Tommy.
- Yeah.

35:25.323 --> 35:27.348
Pete.

35:28.192 --> 35:29.591
- Pete? Peter?
- Pete.

35:29.660 --> 35:31.992
- Pe-Peter Maloney?
- Peter Maloney!

35:32.063 --> 35:35.396
- Oh, my God! Oh, shit!
- Tommy! Tommy...

35:35.466 --> 35:37.400
- Come on.
- Facimimimi.

35:37.468 --> 35:39.936
- No. Uh, uh. Fennili. Fennili.
- Fuckin' who?

35:40.004 --> 35:42.666
Fennili.
Tommy Fennili.

35:42.740 --> 35:45.709
- You're Peter Maloney, Midwood High.
- Right.

35:45.776 --> 35:49.177
- Double A-plus in Algebra.
- Yeah.

35:49.247 --> 35:51.477
You're the guy that wiped out the curve.
How you been?

35:51.549 --> 35:54.017
- How you been?
- Good. Good. I'm good, yeah.

35:54.085 --> 35:56.349
I went to Harvard.
Got my B. A. At Harvard. Went to Yale.

35:56.420 --> 35:59.947
Got a Ph. D. In the disciplinary studies,
philosophy and biology.

36:00.024 --> 36:03.323
- Whoa.
- Yeah. So, what're you... This is your place?

36:03.394 --> 36:06.056
- Uh, yeah, it's my place. Yeah. Kinda.
- Still in the neighborhood?

36:06.130 --> 36:08.792
Yeah. I love the neighborhood,
you know? Hey, wow!

36:08.866 --> 36:11.562
- You mind if I sit down? Thanks. That's great.
- No, no, no. Sit down.

36:11.636 --> 36:14.298
My glasses...

36:14.372 --> 36:17.068
represent probably
the future of glasses...

36:17.141 --> 36:20.269
for a certain segment
of the population.

36:20.344 --> 36:24.178
I've approached, uh...

36:24.248 --> 36:29.242
I went to the patent office first about
my glasses, and that was because...

36:29.320 --> 36:31.754
Let me explain
what the glasses are.

36:32.857 --> 36:35.826
The glasses
only have lenses on top.

36:35.893 --> 36:39.351
We basically go out and we,
and we survey people at random.

36:39.430 --> 36:44.629
And then we take their answers and funnel
them into, into a philosophy basically...

36:44.702 --> 36:46.499
that'll help
improve their life.

36:46.571 --> 36:50.598
I have... Do you want to do a survey?
Can I ask you some questions?

36:50.675 --> 36:52.643
- Who, me?
- 'Cause I have a quota...

36:52.710 --> 36:54.803
and you'd really
be helping me out.

36:54.879 --> 36:58.315
- Right here?
- We can just... We can do it here.

36:58.382 --> 37:01.715
S- Sure. Sure. I got nothin' to lose.
Why not? Let's do it.

37:01.786 --> 37:04.812
Do you believe in God,
Tommy?

37:04.889 --> 37:09.223
- Yeah, I believe in God.
- Okay. Yeah.

37:09.293 --> 37:13.559
- Really?
- Well, don't you?

37:13.631 --> 37:16.395
I think there's a god.

37:16.467 --> 37:19.732
And I'm not it. Okay.

37:19.804 --> 37:23.171
Is there anyone you hate enough to want dead,
and if somebody said they'd kill that person...

37:23.241 --> 37:27.678
and the crime wouldn't be discovered,
would you let them go ahead and do it?

37:27.745 --> 37:31.841
L... That's a hard one.
I don't want anybody dead.

37:31.916 --> 37:34.282
- This is Pete, Tom. You can tell me.
- All right.

37:34.352 --> 37:39.255
- Maybe, uh... Maybe one guy, okay?
- One guy.

37:39.323 --> 37:41.655
There's always that one fuckin' guy,
you know?

37:41.726 --> 37:43.717
- That one fucking asshole.
- One fuckin' guy.

37:43.794 --> 37:45.921
One fuckin' guy.
That's right. Okay.

37:45.997 --> 37:48.261
Do you look at your bowel movements
before you flush the toilet?

37:48.332 --> 37:51.460
- Oh, come on, Peter.
- Just humor me.

37:51.535 --> 37:55.904
Look, come on.
Is it... whoa, a foot-long floater.

37:55.973 --> 37:59.534
You don't even want
to say good-bye to it.

37:59.610 --> 38:01.737
You give it a name,
you know.

38:01.812 --> 38:04.975
All right. Yeah, I look.
Who doesn't look? You look, right?

38:05.049 --> 38:07.677
Abso-fuckin'- lutely,
I look.

38:07.752 --> 38:10.983
I went to
a space shuttle launch.

38:11.055 --> 38:16.391
As the shuttle was taking off...
I could put binoculars right in...

38:16.460 --> 38:19.486
Straight through my frames
because there's no lenses there.

38:19.563 --> 38:21.724
The space scientists
were all huddled around me.

38:21.799 --> 38:25.565
"How can I get a pair of glasses like that?
How can I get a pair of glasses like that?"

38:25.636 --> 38:29.128
Because they're all standing there with
those tacky little strings around their neck...

38:29.206 --> 38:33.404
with glasses hanging or they've got them
on their bald heads.

38:33.477 --> 38:38.642
Or I'll be in a restaurant, and when I go
to read the menu I flip the lenses up.

38:38.716 --> 38:41.583
And people come over and say,
"How can I get a pair of glasses that do that?"

38:41.652 --> 38:44.120
So I saw what my future was.

38:44.188 --> 38:47.453
Th-That perhaps
my future lay...

38:47.525 --> 38:50.460
uh, in eyeglass
frame manufacturing.

38:50.528 --> 38:54.760
Or being sponsored
by a frame manufacturer.

38:54.832 --> 38:58.131
And I was gonna call it
"Lou's Views."

38:58.202 --> 39:01.660
- Are you satisfied with the size and shape of your penis?
- Oh, cripe!

39:01.739 --> 39:05.835
Peter, come on. That's a personal
question. That's a personal question.

39:05.910 --> 39:08.845
These are not... No one's gonna know
this is you. There's no name.

39:08.913 --> 39:11.381
- Who's gonna see this stuff?
- It just gets processed into a computer.

39:11.449 --> 39:15.249
- No. But who is?
- No. You're not satisfied?

39:15.319 --> 39:18.880
What is it? Girth, no distance?
Distance, no girth? No girth, no distance?

39:18.956 --> 39:22.119
Between you and me?
No, I'm... The length is good...

39:22.193 --> 39:27.825
the width is questionable, and I got a
little... It curves a little to the left.

39:27.898 --> 39:30.992
- You got a curved one?
- You know, it leans a little bit.

39:31.068 --> 39:34.765
A leaner. Okay.
That counts in horseshoes.

39:34.839 --> 39:38.104
How much money would it take
for you to eat a bowl of shit, Tom?

39:38.175 --> 39:43.943
Hey! I'm gonna tell
you somethin'. That I won't do.

39:44.014 --> 39:47.882
Every man's got his price, right,
but not me. No, no. Not Tommy Fennili.

39:47.952 --> 39:50.887
- No. Me? Uh-uh. I don't eat shit.
- No shit for Tommy.

39:50.955 --> 39:53.185
It's against my religion.

39:54.425 --> 39:56.950
What religion is that, Tom?

39:57.027 --> 40:01.464
The religion of sanity, Peter.

40:01.532 --> 40:03.966
You should try it sometime.

40:04.034 --> 40:07.629
I belonged. They excommunicated
me. Let me tell you something.

40:07.705 --> 40:12.904
In an insane society,
the sane man must appear insane.

40:12.977 --> 40:14.808
San... Okay.

40:14.879 --> 40:24.944
"Insanity is the logic
of an accurate mind..."

40:25.022 --> 40:27.320
- "Overtaxed."
- "Overtaxed"!

40:27.391 --> 40:29.552
- Oliver Wendell Holmes.
- Yeah, I heard that.

40:29.627 --> 40:32.289
Goddamn it, Tommy!
Goddamn it, thank you.

40:32.363 --> 40:34.831
One thing that you do
get here in Brooklyn...

40:34.899 --> 40:39.097
which I now know from having driven around
the country and looked elsewhere for it...

40:39.170 --> 40:42.037
you get plastic bags
stuck in trees.

40:42.106 --> 40:44.097
And it really drives me nuts.

40:44.175 --> 40:47.667
It's like a flag of chaos.

40:47.745 --> 40:51.841
A bag in a tree.
It's a symbol. It just...

40:51.916 --> 40:55.408
And I used to see them and just...
They would bug me.

40:55.486 --> 41:00.116
And then one day I realized, you know,
you could get it out of the tree.

41:00.191 --> 41:04.127
So a friend and I made
a long bag snagger.

41:04.195 --> 41:06.993
For which we are currently
applying for a patent, in fact...

41:07.064 --> 41:09.965
because no one ever made
something to take bags out of trees.

41:10.034 --> 41:12.434
And it works very well.
It's a long aluminum pole.

41:12.503 --> 41:16.997
And we can actually reach now
almost, I would say, 50 plus feet.

41:17.074 --> 41:19.406
It's fun. It's exercise. It's...

41:19.477 --> 41:23.436
Holding a big pole up and stretching.
We walk a fair amount.

41:23.514 --> 41:27.382
And it definitely makes things nice,
you know. Improves the tree.

41:28.519 --> 41:31.079
This is your basic bag
in a tree.

41:31.155 --> 41:34.852
This can be recorded on film.
We know that it existed.

41:34.925 --> 41:40.227
And when you come back, it will be...
only an image on film...

41:40.297 --> 41:43.130
because I will
have taken it out.

41:43.200 --> 41:46.727
- Is this your mission in Brooklyn?
- I don't consider it a mission.

41:46.804 --> 41:50.137
It's more like a hobby. Something to do
with my friends. It's fun to do.

41:50.207 --> 41:54.200
And it's very satisfying. It's also...
It used to be I would see a bag like that...

41:54.278 --> 41:57.076
and just shrug and think,
"Well, there's that bag."

41:57.147 --> 42:01.243
And now I see a bag and I think,
"You're comin' out, pal."

42:05.322 --> 42:08.120
Once there was a major league
baseball team in Brooklyn.

42:08.192 --> 42:10.786
But that was a long time ago.

42:15.065 --> 42:18.626
<i>Jackie Robinson,
Brooklyn's famed number 42...</i>

42:18.702 --> 42:20.932
<i>baseball's first Negro
in the major leagues...</i>

42:21.005 --> 42:24.236
<i>continues to captivate fans
nationwide with his daring play.</i>

42:25.509 --> 42:29.001
Boy, when they moved
the Dodgers out of Brooklyn...

42:29.079 --> 42:32.173
I don't believe
there ever was a worse day.

42:32.249 --> 42:34.410
Maybe when the war
was declared.

42:34.485 --> 42:38.581
But other than that, I don't think that
Brooklyn ever experienced a worse day...

42:38.656 --> 42:42.422
than when they moved
the Dodgers to California...

42:42.493 --> 42:44.688
and the wrecking ball
hit Ebbets Field.

42:44.762 --> 42:47.253
There was nothing like it.
The stadium, the ball park...

42:47.331 --> 42:50.232
was like a little old
country club.

42:50.301 --> 42:53.065
The fans all knew each other,
and the Dodgers' Symphony...

42:53.137 --> 42:56.129
was a group of workin' guys
that went out...

42:56.206 --> 43:00.643
played the trombone, the trumpet, the drums
and generally made fools out of themselves.

43:00.711 --> 43:02.838
Everybody loved them
and they didn't care.

43:02.913 --> 43:05.473
The ballplayers
all lived in Brooklyn!

43:05.549 --> 43:09.349
They weren't all from Brooklyn,
but they lived on Bedford Avenue...

43:09.420 --> 43:14.653
and they used to rent apartments right around
the stadium, right around Ebbets Field.

43:14.725 --> 43:17.159
Everybody knew 'em in the neighborhood.
"Hey, Duke Snider!

43:17.227 --> 43:20.822
Jackie! How're you?" You know, whatever.
It was like a family thing.

43:20.898 --> 43:23.799
Now, no more baseball
in Brooklyn.

43:47.591 --> 43:52.085
Hey, Auggie, it's a lot of money.
I'd be crazy to turn it down.

43:52.162 --> 43:54.926
<i>After 19 years,
you’re just gonna walk away?</i>

43:54.999 --> 43:57.194
I can't believe it.

43:57.267 --> 43:59.929
It's dollars and cents.

44:00.004 --> 44:03.531
The store's been losing money
for years. You know it as well as I do.

44:03.607 --> 44:06.770
But you've got
plenty of money, Vin.

44:06.844 --> 44:09.904
All those real estate deals
out on the island.

44:09.980 --> 44:12.778
I mean, you just
write this place off on your taxes.

44:12.850 --> 44:15.580
Too late.
We're already in contract.

44:18.288 --> 44:21.416
Hmph. So
the Brooklyn Cigar Company...

44:21.492 --> 44:23.960
is gonna become
a health food store?

44:26.030 --> 44:28.555
Times change, Auggie.

44:28.632 --> 44:32.363
Tobacco's out.
Wheat germ's in.

44:32.436 --> 44:34.904
You know, it may not be
such a bad thing for you, either.

44:34.972 --> 44:39.932
I mean, uh, maybe it's time
you moved on too.

44:41.945 --> 44:45.904
I don't wanna see you turn into an
old man sitting behind that counter.

44:45.983 --> 44:48.781
Everybody has to grow old.

44:48.852 --> 44:52.015
What difference does it make
where it happens?

44:59.063 --> 45:02.555
No more free cigars,
huh, Auggie?

45:02.633 --> 45:06.034
You really should
think this thing through before you...

45:06.103 --> 45:09.561
let it happen, Vincent.

45:09.640 --> 45:13.838
I mean, sure. It's a dinky,
little nothing neighborhood store.

45:13.911 --> 45:16.471
But everybody comes in here.

45:16.547 --> 45:20.916
I mean, not just the smokers. The kids
come in, the school kids for their candy.

45:20.984 --> 45:24.112
Old Mrs. McKinna comes in
for her soap opera magazines.

45:24.188 --> 45:27.055
Crazy Louie
for his cough drops.

45:27.124 --> 45:29.684
Frank Diaz
for his El Deario.

45:29.760 --> 45:32.923
Fat Mr. Chin
for his crossword puzzles.

45:32.996 --> 45:35.624
I mean, the whole neighborhood
comes in here.

45:35.699 --> 45:37.599
It's a hangout.

45:37.668 --> 45:40.068
And it helps to keep
the neighborhood together.

45:40.137 --> 45:42.367
Twenty blocks from here...

45:42.439 --> 45:46.341
12-year-old kids are shootin'
each other for their sneakers.

45:46.410 --> 45:51.575
I mean, you close this store
and it's one more nail in the coffin.

45:51.648 --> 45:54.708
You'll be helpin'
to kill off this neighborhood.

45:56.687 --> 46:00.817
You're trying to make me feel guilty.
Is that what you're doin'?

46:00.891 --> 46:03.883
No. I'm just
givin'you the facts.

46:03.961 --> 46:06.521
You can do
what you want with them.

46:12.903 --> 46:17.033
That Auggie,
he's gonna drive me crazy.

46:17.107 --> 46:21.703
Just when I get the deal together,
he comes in playin' those fuckin' violins.

46:22.713 --> 46:24.840
Brooklyn! Hmph.

46:26.116 --> 46:30.712
Brooklyn. I'm supposed
to care about Brooklyn.

46:30.788 --> 46:34.121
I don't even live in this
shit hole of a town anymore.

46:41.165 --> 46:44.066
Hiya, Vinny.

46:44.134 --> 46:46.602
Jackie!

46:46.670 --> 46:50.128
In the flesh, sport.

46:50.207 --> 46:54.667
Jackie, the greatest
ballplayer of them all.

46:54.745 --> 46:58.340
I used to pray for you
every night when I was a kid.

46:58.415 --> 47:02.044
I was the man
that changed America, Vinny.

47:02.119 --> 47:05.782
And I did it all right here,
in Brooklyn.

47:05.856 --> 47:09.155
Oh, they spat at me.
Cursed me.

47:09.226 --> 47:11.694
Made my life
a never-ending hell.

47:11.762 --> 47:14.128
And I wasn't allowed
to fight back.

47:16.300 --> 47:20.794
It takes its toll,
being a martyr.

47:20.871 --> 47:24.807
I died when I was
53 years old, Vinny.

47:24.875 --> 47:28.106
Even younger
than you are now.

47:28.178 --> 47:31.306
But I was a hell
of a ballplayer, wasn't I?

47:31.381 --> 47:35.112
The best, Jackie.
You were the best there was.

47:35.185 --> 47:37.676
Things changed after me.

47:37.754 --> 47:41.121
Not just for black people.
For white people too.

47:41.191 --> 47:45.184
After me, well, white people
and black people...

47:45.262 --> 47:49.699
never looked at each other
in the same old way anymore.

47:49.766 --> 47:53.600
And it all happened
right here, in Brooklyn.

47:55.038 --> 47:59.475
Yeah, then they...
moved the team away.

47:59.543 --> 48:03.377
Almost broke my heart. What'd they do
a dumb thing like that for?

48:03.447 --> 48:07.440
Dollars and cents,
Vinny.

48:07.517 --> 48:10.042
Ebbets Field
may be gone now...

48:10.120 --> 48:14.284
but what happened there
lives on in the mind.

48:14.358 --> 48:19.261
That's where it counts, Vinny.
Mind over matter.

48:19.329 --> 48:23.356
There are more important
things in life than baseball.

48:23.433 --> 48:27.426
But, Brooklyn looks good.

48:27.504 --> 48:31.338
More or less the same it was
the last time I saw it.

48:31.408 --> 48:34.571
And Prospect Park over there.

48:34.645 --> 48:37.739
Still as beautiful as ever.

48:39.683 --> 48:45.417
Say, Vinny, they don't still
make those Belgian waffles, do they?

48:45.489 --> 48:50.984
Ah, man! What I wouldn't give to sink
my teeth into a Belgian waffle!

48:51.061 --> 48:55.054
Two scoops of pistachio ice cream,
some bananas on top.

48:55.132 --> 48:58.727
Hmph. Boy,
do I miss those things.

48:58.802 --> 49:02.761
Belgian waffles, sure.
They still make 'em.

49:02.839 --> 49:06.434
Just go down two blocks
to the Cosmic Diner.

49:06.510 --> 49:10.276
Jackie, they'll make you
all the Belgian waffles you want.

49:10.347 --> 49:13.316
Thanks, sport.

49:13.383 --> 49:16.352
Don't mind if I do.

49:16.420 --> 49:20.720
A day in Brooklyn just wouldn't be complete
without stopping in for a Belgian waffle.

49:20.791 --> 49:22.759
Would it?

49:26.997 --> 49:30.700
Every day 7,999...

49:30.767 --> 49:35.295
Belgian waffles are eaten
in the restaurants of Brooklyn.

49:35.372 --> 49:39.536
The, the waffle culture
in Belgium is, um, is complex.

49:39.609 --> 49:43.978
Waffles generally are made in huge
batches, and then they're eaten cold.

49:44.047 --> 49:48.814
They're not a breakfast food. Uh, they're
like cookies or something, or raisin bread.

49:48.885 --> 49:53.151
They're that kind of food. You eat
them with coffee in the afternoon.

49:53.223 --> 49:57.956
The Belgian waffle as it's known here, with
great piles of strawberries and whipped cream...

49:58.028 --> 50:02.362
is something that Belgians
are never failed to be amazed by.

50:02.432 --> 50:05.026
I think Belgians
kind of like Belgian waffles.

50:05.102 --> 50:09.835
But to them, Belgian waffles
seem distinctly American.

50:09.906 --> 50:13.740
They've got that big Hollywood
overproduction to them, which Belgians...

50:13.810 --> 50:18.076
It's kind of foreign to Belgians
to overdo things quite in that way.

50:30.427 --> 50:34.329
Cigarettes are sort of like
a reminder of your mortality in a way.

50:34.398 --> 50:39.995
Like each puff is like
a passing moment, a passing thought.

50:40.070 --> 50:43.369
You know, you smoke.
Smoke disappears.

50:43.440 --> 50:48.605
It reminds you that
to live is also to die somehow.

50:48.678 --> 50:52.273
I don't know, I'm gonna miss 'em.
But anyway, last one is with you, Auggie.

50:52.349 --> 50:56.809
Boom!

50:56.887 --> 50:59.447
Shit.

50:59.523 --> 51:02.253
It's out, man. Got a light?

51:05.529 --> 51:07.463
Adios.

51:08.565 --> 51:10.726
Adios, amigo.

51:10.801 --> 51:13.326
Adios, "cigarrettos. '

51:18.442 --> 51:21.434
L. S. Equals M. F. T.

51:21.511 --> 51:24.139
Loose stomach
means full toilet.

51:24.214 --> 51:27.741
Or something like that.

51:27.818 --> 51:31.811
When we were kids, that's what
we used to say about Lucky Strikes.

51:31.888 --> 51:34.083
Yeah, there it is.

51:34.157 --> 51:36.682
What'd I tell you?

51:36.760 --> 51:39.422
I love this too.
"It's toasted."

51:39.496 --> 51:43.694
Oh, boy.

51:43.767 --> 51:45.997
They sure do
take us for a ride, huh?

51:46.069 --> 51:48.799
- How's it taste?
- Tastes great.

51:59.683 --> 52:01.651
There he goes.

52:01.718 --> 52:05.882
Thirty seconds over Tokyo.

52:05.956 --> 52:08.015
Bombs away.

52:09.826 --> 52:12.727
- Want a smoke?
- No, thanks. I quit.

52:14.364 --> 52:16.855
<i>Ebbets Field,
"Shrine of Flatbush, '</i>

52:16.933 --> 52:19.128
<i>will make way
for apartment houses.</i>

52:24.708 --> 52:28.838
<i>The old ball park, standing for nearly
half a century, comes to the end of the trail.</i>

52:28.912 --> 52:31.972
<i>The stands where thousands
once roared...</i>

52:32.048 --> 52:34.881
<i>await another kind
of wrecking crew.</i>

52:40.757 --> 52:42.884
<i>Home plate is dug up
to find a niche...</i>

52:42.959 --> 52:45.553
<i>in the Baseball Hall of Fame
at Cooperstown.</i>

52:45.629 --> 52:49.463
<i>At the sad ceremony, Roy Campanella
is surrounded by old Dodger players...</i>

52:49.533 --> 52:52.195
<i>Tommy Holmes, Ralph Branca
and Carl Erskine.</i>

52:52.269 --> 52:56.296
<i>They watch stoically for the demolition
of their old playground.</i>

52:59.176 --> 53:01.474
<i>Now it's play ball again...</i>

53:01.545 --> 53:04.810
<i>but not the sort
Dodger fans cheer.</i>

53:09.419 --> 53:14.015
<i>This time, Ebbets Field itself
is struck out.</i>

54:00.971 --> 54:04.168
Today is my birthday,
and I'm 18 now.

54:04.241 --> 54:08.439
<i>Da-da-da-da da-da</i>

54:08.511 --> 54:11.947
That's so sweet.
Nobody sung it to me yet.

54:12.015 --> 54:14.779
Brooklyn will take care
of me tonight, though.

54:14.851 --> 54:18.981
If I go around my way and tell everybody
today's my birthday, they'll celebrate.

54:19.055 --> 54:22.957
You'll see fireworks,
but they'll be gunshots.

54:23.026 --> 54:28.020
And, um... people'll probably hit me
with cakes and eggs and powder socks.

54:28.098 --> 54:30.191
That's how they celebrate
my birthday.

54:30.267 --> 54:32.326
I don't get no cake
and can eat it.

54:32.402 --> 54:36.998
I have to get it smashed in my face, and
beat with a powder sock for a surprise party.

54:37.073 --> 54:41.737
Walk in my building 'cause somebody beat me
with a sock, and hit me with a egg probably.

54:41.811 --> 54:44.712
Y'all have a nice day.

54:44.781 --> 54:47.181
- You too. Happy birthday.
- All right. Thank you.

54:53.390 --> 54:56.587
Ay, Augusto.!

54:58.161 --> 55:02.723
You make me
so horny!

55:02.799 --> 55:07.793
You make
my tripas tremble.

55:07.871 --> 55:10.863
Ay, Augusto.!

55:10.940 --> 55:15.001
You would be
so wonderful...

55:15.078 --> 55:18.104
if only you were different.

55:19.349 --> 55:21.681
That Auggie.

55:21.751 --> 55:26.017
That Auggie,
he gonna drive me cuckoo!

55:29.959 --> 55:32.359
First he say "yes"...
then he say "no."

55:32.429 --> 55:37.332
Is "on"...is "off."
Maybe some other time.

55:37.400 --> 55:42.269
But Ramon, you see,
he don't know some other time.

55:42.339 --> 55:45.604
He's going to play
at Freddie's on the sixteenth.

55:45.675 --> 55:50.578
And now, Augusto say
he's too busy on the sixteenth.

55:54.551 --> 55:56.519
Ay.

55:56.586 --> 55:59.851
What gives around here, huh?

55:59.923 --> 56:03.484
Is somebody deaf
or something?

56:03.560 --> 56:07.257
I talk myself
blue in the face!

56:07.330 --> 56:11.357
And still,
it don't do no good.

56:13.136 --> 56:16.936
Lock this door.

56:17.006 --> 56:21.204
- I want you to lock this. All right.
- What's with you, Dot?

56:23.046 --> 56:26.038
I don't want to talk to you.
I don't wanna say anything to you.

56:26.116 --> 56:29.984
- Um, if he comes to the door, don't let him in.
- Vinny?

56:30.053 --> 56:33.784
- Yeah. Where's the money? I know he keeps money around here.
- I count it...

56:33.857 --> 56:38.260
- I know he's got a secret stash besides what's in here, right?
- No, no.

56:38.328 --> 56:40.592
- I'm taking this too.
- What's the matter with you?

56:40.663 --> 56:43.427
It's only today's receipts.
What are you doing?

56:43.500 --> 56:46.958
I'm taking the money.
I told you before.

56:47.036 --> 56:50.233
I'm going to Las Vegas
by myself.

56:50.306 --> 56:52.706
I asked him to go and he doesn't wanna
go, so I'm going to go to Las Vegas.

56:52.776 --> 56:55.210
Not only am I going there for a visit,
but I'm going to go there...

56:55.278 --> 56:59.112
and I might just fucking live there,
you know what I mean?

56:59.182 --> 57:02.879
- What happened?
- What happened? I told you what happened.

57:02.952 --> 57:06.183
He's a fuckin' bore.
I'm going to do something exciting.

57:06.256 --> 57:09.851
I'm going to go to Las Vegas,
and I'm going to wait to see Wayne Newton.

57:09.926 --> 57:11.917
You know what I mean?
Then when I see Wayne Newton...

57:11.995 --> 57:14.964
I'm going to chase him down the street
and I'm gonna mount him like Trigger.

57:15.031 --> 57:18.296
I want out, and I wanna go have fun.
And I'm gonna. I'm gonna.

57:18.368 --> 57:20.996
And don't try to talk me out of it.
Because the last time I tried to talk to you...

57:21.070 --> 57:23.061
you didn't have nothin' to say to me,
I have nothin' to say to you.

57:23.139 --> 57:25.801
I have nothing to say to him.
And you're gonna tell him that for me.

57:25.875 --> 57:27.900
Nothing about your life
is boring, right?

57:27.977 --> 57:31.970
You're just terribly excited
about everything that you do?

57:32.048 --> 57:37.486
You're terribly excited about everything.
Everything's like A-okay, okeydoke, right?

57:37.554 --> 57:42.287
- I'm in a good place. Yeah.
- I don't think you're in a good place.

57:42.358 --> 57:46.454
I've known ya for a long time.
I don't think you're in a good place.

57:46.529 --> 57:51.330
I say that as your friend. I don't think...
I think you could be in a better place.

57:51.401 --> 57:55.201
- Like where?
- I don't know! I think you could be in a better place.

57:55.271 --> 57:57.831
Like... I think you could be
in a better place...

57:57.907 --> 58:01.809
like... Las Vegas
is a better place.

58:01.878 --> 58:04.870
Would you want
to go with me?

58:04.948 --> 58:08.213
- What?
- I mean, I have money and everything.

58:08.284 --> 58:13.517
I think you deserve to be loved very fucking
well. I really do think that about you.

58:13.590 --> 58:17.788
I know you don't have that
and I could do that.

58:17.861 --> 58:21.763
I, I could, um...
I could do that.

58:21.831 --> 58:25.460
Give me some of this.
I could love you very well.

58:25.535 --> 58:29.733
Would you go to Las Vegas
with me?

58:31.808 --> 58:34.276
Jesus, Dot.

58:35.411 --> 58:37.902
Would you go to Las Vegas
with me?

58:41.217 --> 58:43.276
Will you come to Las Vegas
with me, honey?

58:43.353 --> 58:45.685
Dot, Jesus. What am
I doing to my friend, Dot?

58:45.755 --> 58:49.020
Everybody's got friends.
You got enough friends.

58:51.127 --> 58:53.459
This ain't right, Dot.
No, no.

58:53.530 --> 58:56.397
No, no. Dot, this ain't right.
This ain't right.

58:56.466 --> 58:58.559
Listen, I really care about you.
I really care about you.

58:58.635 --> 59:01.934
But this ain't right.
It ain't right. This ain't right.

59:02.005 --> 59:04.439
- Listen, listen. Nothing's right.
- No, no, no.

59:04.507 --> 59:07.374
Nothing in the whole fucking world
is ever right. Do you know?

59:07.443 --> 59:10.105
- Things that are wrong are good!
- Yeah.

59:10.179 --> 59:12.170
- They could be good.
- They could be good. That's right.

59:12.248 --> 59:14.216
- I've always wanted to kiss you.
- But this is wrong.

59:14.284 --> 59:16.752
I've always wanted to kiss you.
Just let me kiss you.

59:16.819 --> 59:18.719
- I can't say I haven't wanted to kiss you either.
- Just let me kiss you.

59:18.788 --> 59:22.690
I can't say...
No, no, no. Dot.

59:22.759 --> 59:27.355
- Dot, I want you to stop it. I want you to stop it.
- Okay, fuck you. I'm going.

59:28.464 --> 59:30.830
Good-bye.

59:38.107 --> 59:41.770
Oh, fuck me. Fuck.

59:44.013 --> 59:46.948
What's going on? What's up?

59:47.016 --> 59:50.213
- What's going on?
- You see Dot go out? She was just here.

59:50.286 --> 59:51.913
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

59:51.988 --> 59:54.582
What's going on?
She didn't talk to me.

59:54.657 --> 59:57.956
She seemed very upset.

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:16.478
- Oh, man. Oh, man.
- Where'd you go?

01:00:16.546 --> 01:00:20.778
Because I did not want you
to come in. Do you understand that?

01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:22.909
Do you speak English?

01:00:22.986 --> 01:00:26.649
I don't wanna talk
to you anyway.

01:00:26.723 --> 01:00:29.157
You're not going anywhere.

01:00:29.225 --> 01:00:33.286
- Why?
- What do you mean, why? What the hell you talkin' about?

01:00:33.363 --> 01:00:35.729
- I'm going to Las Vegas.
- For what?

01:00:35.798 --> 01:00:39.029
For what? To be in show business.
To have excitement.

01:00:39.102 --> 01:00:43.596
To do things besides watch you sit
on the couch and watch fucking TV.

01:00:43.673 --> 01:00:47.666
- Be in show business?
- Well, around show business!

01:00:47.744 --> 01:00:51.680
I'm not talking to him.
Tell him I'm not gonna talk to him.

01:00:51.748 --> 01:00:53.773
- You want me to tell him?
- L... What?

01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:55.681
- Five times you want me to tell you?
- What did I do?

01:00:55.752 --> 01:00:59.188
Tell him I'm not talking to him because
he does not know how to communicate.

01:00:59.255 --> 01:01:01.280
- Communicating. Do you know what that means?
- Yeah. What's the matter?

01:01:01.357 --> 01:01:04.190
What does it mean?
Tell me what it means. Define it!

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:07.127
- Talking to each other.
- Talking. But what comes after talking?

01:01:07.196 --> 01:01:10.324
Do you have any fucking idea
what comes after talking?

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:14.928
It starts with an "L." I'll give you
a clue. It starts with an "L."

01:01:15.004 --> 01:01:17.472
- It's three syllables. You know what it is?
- Yeah.

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:18.973
- What is it?
- Listening.

01:01:19.042 --> 01:01:22.034
- Yes! Thank you. You win the big fucking jackpot.
- I'm listening.

01:01:22.111 --> 01:01:25.080
- No, you don't know how to listen.
- I'm listening!

01:01:25.148 --> 01:01:28.083
I told you what the problem is.
Then why are you asking me again?

01:01:28.151 --> 01:01:29.618
- I'm listening.
- You're not listening!

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:33.281
- What's the problem?
- The problem is that you never, ever listen!

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:38.658
- I'm listening now! Tell me!
- You don't listen to me.

01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:42.722
What am I doing?

01:01:42.799 --> 01:01:45.996
- You're listenin'.
- I'm listenin'.

01:02:01.084 --> 01:02:03.712
You want a Belgian waffle,
go to Belgium.

01:02:03.786 --> 01:02:07.278
Don't go to the Dutch part,
go to the French part.

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:12.384
And if I want a Boston egg cream,
should I go to Boston?

01:02:12.462 --> 01:02:16.626
I want to go to Las Vegas
right now!

01:02:16.699 --> 01:02:19.361
And I'm goin' with you,
or I'm goin' without you.

01:02:19.435 --> 01:02:23.064
Because I already have money.
So are you goin' with me or not?

01:02:23.139 --> 01:02:26.836
And I'm not even gonna ask you. Forget that
I said that, because you already said no.

01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:31.107
So I'm not gonna let you
fucking tell me no one more time.

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:33.978
We're going to Vegas...
right now!

01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:36.518
- We're going to...
- Right the fuck now.

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:39.680
- We're going to Vegas, Auggie.
- Have a good time.

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:42.657
- All right? Yeah, we're going to Vegas.
- We're really goin'? Okay.

01:02:42.725 --> 01:02:45.091
- Okay?
- Okay. Right now?

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:47.994
- All right.
- We're not gonna have...

01:02:48.064 --> 01:02:50.157
- We're goin' to Vegas.
- Come on.

01:02:50.233 --> 01:02:51.928
- Auggie.
- See ya.

01:02:52.001 --> 01:02:54.595
Adios.

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:57.195
Are we really gonna go?

01:02:57.273 --> 01:03:00.037
Vegas.

01:03:21.464 --> 01:03:23.227
You stand right there, okay?

01:03:23.299 --> 01:03:28.202
Okay. Here we go.

01:03:28.271 --> 01:03:33.800
In the words
of the famous poet...

01:03:33.876 --> 01:03:36.276
Billy Shake-a-speare...

01:03:36.345 --> 01:03:38.836
I quote you:

01:03:38.915 --> 01:03:40.974
What are you doin'?

01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:45.350
"To be or not to be?

01:03:45.421 --> 01:03:47.389
That is the question."

01:03:47.456 --> 01:03:51.552
Jimmy, lock the door.
Put the closed sign on.

01:03:51.627 --> 01:03:55.961
Well, Auggie... I am!

01:03:56.032 --> 01:03:59.695
Okay? So that is that.

01:03:59.769 --> 01:04:03.637
Come here, because
I'm going to make love to you.

01:04:03.706 --> 01:04:08.200
And I'm going to ride you
like a big bull.

01:04:08.277 --> 01:04:12.236
Ay.! What's this?
Is this for me?

01:04:12.315 --> 01:04:14.579
Oh, yeah, baby,
this is mine.

01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:17.483
This is mine, all mine, and only mine.

01:04:17.553 --> 01:04:21.956
I cannot bear the thought of you being
with another woman. It makes me crazy!

01:04:22.024 --> 01:04:26.654
<i>Never know how much
I love you</i>

<i>Never know how much I care</i>

01:04:30.733 --> 01:04:34.100
<i>When you put your arms
around me</i>

01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:37.105
<i>I get a fever
that's so hard to bear</i>

01:04:37.173 --> 01:04:39.971
<i>You give me fever Yeah</i>

01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:42.567
<i>When you kiss me</i>

01:04:42.645 --> 01:04:46.513
<i>Fever when you hold me tight</i>

01:04:46.582 --> 01:04:50.313
<i>Fever Ooh, in the morning</i>

01:04:50.386 --> 01:04:54.322
<i>Fever all through the night</i>

01:04:54.390 --> 01:05:01.323
<i>Fever</i>

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:04.127
Ay, yeah, Augusto.

01:05:09.338 --> 01:05:12.933
<i>Fever Ooh, in the morning</i>

01:05:13.009 --> 01:05:16.501
<i>Fever all through the night</i>

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:20.276
<i>Daddy, don't you treat me right
Pow, pow, pow</i>

01:05:20.349 --> 01:05:23.011
<i>Ooh</i>

01:05:23.085 --> 01:05:27.021
<i>What a lovely way to burn
Ah, ah, ah</i>

01:05:27.089 --> 01:05:29.489
<i>Fever</i>

01:05:29.558 --> 01:05:31.958
You like a Spanish women?

01:05:32.028 --> 01:05:36.260
I'm glad you like a Spanish women,
because I am Spanish woman.

01:05:36.332 --> 01:05:39.699
<i>Ay, ay, ay yeah</i>

01:05:41.904 --> 01:05:44.168
<i>S- s-s-s-s</i>

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:47.232
<i>You give me fever</i>

01:05:49.345 --> 01:05:52.678
I can't get enough of you,
Auggie!

01:06:07.697 --> 01:06:11.463
Is this the
Brooklyn Cigar Company?

01:06:11.534 --> 01:06:14.059
In the flesh.
What can I do you for?

01:06:14.136 --> 01:06:18.163
I'm looking for
a Mr. Augustus Ren.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:21.732
- Well, you found him, beautiful.
- Great.

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:25.144
I've never been to Brooklyn before.
I wasn't sure I'd find you.

01:06:25.214 --> 01:06:30.015
Well, Brooklyn's on the map. We've even
got streets out here. Electricity too.

01:06:30.086 --> 01:06:34.147
You don't say? Well?

01:06:34.223 --> 01:06:37.954
- Well what?
- I have a telegram for you.

01:06:38.027 --> 01:06:41.656
- Nobody's dead, I hope.
- A singing telegram.

01:06:43.532 --> 01:06:45.796
This gets better and better.

01:06:45.868 --> 01:06:48.962
- You ready?
- Ready when you are.

01:06:53.476 --> 01:06:58.675

<i>- Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da Boom

01:07:32.681 --> 01:07:34.740
Dynamite, sweetheart.

01:07:34.817 --> 01:07:39.311
Dynamite.
I say that's worth at least a $5 tip.

01:07:42.258 --> 01:07:45.318
Five dollars?

01:07:45.394 --> 01:07:47.521
Thanks a lot, mister.

01:07:47.596 --> 01:07:51.692
I'll finally be able to buy that
hearing aid my mother always wanted.

01:07:51.767 --> 01:07:55.567
Anytime you got some more good news,
you know where to find me.

01:07:56.739 --> 01:07:59.401
"The deal is off."

01:07:59.475 --> 01:08:01.739
Ba-ba boom.

01:08:03.012 --> 01:08:07.278
"Not selling the store.
Stop. See you next week.

01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:10.318
Love from Las Vegas."
Ba-ba boom, Jimmy!

01:08:10.386 --> 01:08:13.480
Ba-boom! Ba-boom!

01:08:13.556 --> 01:08:17.014
- We don't have to leave?
- No. We don't have to leave, Jimmy.

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:20.187
Keep sweepin'.
Sweep all of Brooklyn, Jimmy.

01:08:20.261 --> 01:08:22.526
Brooklyn is yours.

01:08:22.798 --> 01:08:25.562
<i>That's most of it, I think.</i>

01:08:25.634 --> 01:08:28.330
<i>Who knows why
all those crazy things happened.</i>

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:31.100
<i>I mean, maybe
Vinny really did see a ghost.</i>

01:08:31.173 --> 01:08:34.108
<i>And maybe Violet really
was gonna rip my guts out.</i>

01:08:34.176 --> 01:08:36.303
<i>Who could be sure
of anything?</i>

01:08:36.377 --> 01:08:39.541
I love you!

01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:46.310
<i>What I do know is that the day after
Vinny and Dot left for Las Vegas...</i>

01:08:46.388 --> 01:08:51.553
<i>the temperature in Brooklyn dropped
below 90 for the first time in two weeks.</i>

01:08:54.763 --> 01:08:57.630
- Wow.
- Well, what are you two lovebirds up to?

01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:59.827
A hell of a lot!

01:08:59.902 --> 01:09:04.270
- Do you mind if I join in?
- Of course. Be my guest.

01:09:10.379 --> 01:09:12.870
<i>So I decided
to throw a little party.</i>

01:09:12.948 --> 01:09:17.317
<i>Things had pretty much returned to normal, and
I was feeling good enough to wanna celebrate.</i>

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:19.786
All right, Brooklyn,
I'm gonna teach you a new dance.

01:09:19.854 --> 01:09:22.187
It's called "The Brooklyn Cha-Cha."
It's real simple, okay?

01:09:22.258 --> 01:09:28.060
It goes like this, okay? Step, step,
cross, open, back, back, cha-cha-cha.

01:09:30.299 --> 01:09:32.926
<i>It wasn't my fault
that things got out of hand.</i>

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:36.995
<i>When 572 citizens of Brooklyn
show up in the same spot...</i>

01:09:37.072 --> 01:09:39.734
<i>spirits are bound to run high.</i>

01:09:39.808 --> 01:09:42.834
<i>To tell the truth,
I wasn't around to see it all.</i>

01:09:42.912 --> 01:09:45.142
<i>Violet and I had other business
to attend to that night...</i>

01:09:45.214 --> 01:09:47.876
<i>and I sort of lost track
of the time.</i>

01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:52.683
<i>Nine months later, I was passing out
cigars myself... free of charge.</i>

01:09:52.755 --> 01:09:57.158
<i>It was a boy.
We named him Jackie.</i>

01:09:57.226 --> 01:10:01.595
<i>His first solid food
was a Belgian waffle.</i>

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:15.241
Baseball is a beautiful game.
You can't blame it on 'em.

01:10:15.311 --> 01:10:17.336
I'm not talking about the game.
The point is...

01:10:17.413 --> 01:10:19.881
I'm just saying personally,
the way I feel about it.

01:10:19.949 --> 01:10:22.747
I understand. But you don't see
the beauty of the game?

01:10:22.818 --> 01:10:25.878
Just forget it.
Dennis, forget it.

01:10:25.955 --> 01:10:28.355
- Are you the chief?
- Yeah.

01:10:28.424 --> 01:10:33.452
¿El jefecito, eh?
I got something for that thing, huh?

01:10:33.529 --> 01:10:36.123
- Huh?
- I got something for you.

01:10:36.198 --> 01:10:40.635
- What?
- Cuban cigars.

01:10:40.703 --> 01:10:44.730
- Yeah?
- I got some connection. I could do like that.

01:10:44.807 --> 01:10:47.742
And you could... you could be okay, man.

01:10:47.810 --> 01:10:51.837
- What kind of cigars you got?
- He almost had me. He almost had me.

01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:54.747
- What're you talkin' about, okay?
- Come on, Auggie. Don't you see it?

01:10:54.817 --> 01:10:57.809
- This is serious business here, man.
- See? You hear that voice?

01:10:57.886 --> 01:11:00.354
- He was in here last year with the watches.
- What're you talkin' about, man?

01:11:00.422 --> 01:11:02.322
- You don't know me, man. I got connections.
- He was in here.

01:11:02.391 --> 01:11:05.360
- You got to be fucking kidding me.
- I can do that for you, man.

01:11:05.427 --> 01:11:08.089
- I got connections.
- I don't believe this.

01:11:08.163 --> 01:11:10.393
- Man, gimme a kiss.
- What'd I tell you?

01:11:10.466 --> 01:11:13.902
- You want a kiss, baby?
- Gimme a kiss.

01:11:13.969 --> 01:11:17.405
Oh, man, another scam, huh?
Always on the scam.

01:11:17.473 --> 01:11:20.101
- Were you serious about the cigars?
- No.

01:11:20.175 --> 01:11:23.167
- Oh!
- Oh, man. You got a hustle for everything.

01:11:23.245 --> 01:11:25.213
- What? Do you like it here? Were you lonely?
- Wh-What do you think?

01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:27.010
- You like it? You like me like this?
- You look good!

01:11:27.082 --> 01:11:28.777
- You like it?
- Nice.

01:11:28.851 --> 01:11:30.785
- ¿Te gusta?
- Who are you this week?

01:11:30.853 --> 01:11:32.878
- Valentino.
- Valentino, huh?

01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:38.689
- Valentino. The lover. The Latin lover! The lover!
- Like me.

01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:41.321
Do you sit at home
and think this stuff up?

01:11:41.397 --> 01:11:44.662
No, actually I'm on my way.
I got a 3:30 appointment.

01:11:44.733 --> 01:11:47.998
- I got a record contract that... might happen.
- Ooh!

01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:51.164
- Do you wanna buy a bridge?
- Very funny.

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:53.504
No, seriously, man, seriously.
No, I'm very musical.

01:11:53.575 --> 01:11:56.305
- He's got the voice for it.
- He could, he could do it.

01:11:56.378 --> 01:11:58.403
- I got a record deal happenin'.
- I think he could do it.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:02.473
- Sure, man, you got a voice.
- You know, God bless Brooklyn to make me who I am today.

01:12:02.551 --> 01:12:07.250
I'm glad you guys like the suit. I figured I'd
try to pull one more scam on you before I go.

01:12:07.323 --> 01:12:10.349
Pull a scam on the man!
'Cause, see. You understand. Like...

01:12:10.426 --> 01:12:11.893
- Where're you from?
- Me?

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.894
- Yeah.
- Well, my family's from...

01:12:13.962 --> 01:12:16.487
"My family!" Why do they always do that?
Man, he's from Italy.

01:12:16.565 --> 01:12:19.295
- Where're you from? France? You French now?
- I'm proud to be...

01:12:19.368 --> 01:12:21.996
- I'm Puerto Rican all the way through.
- You're Puerto Rican.

01:12:22.071 --> 01:12:25.939
- I'm Puerto Rican, but...
- What's wrong with you guys, man? Jesus Christ!

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:29.910
Now, you're gonna tell me he's black!
He's Italian. You're French and he's black.

01:12:29.978 --> 01:12:35.041
What's up, brother?
How you doin', black man?

01:12:35.117 --> 01:12:38.712
You got a great rap,
but you gotta follow this stuff up.

01:12:38.787 --> 01:12:41.654
What's you talkin', follow it up?
Look at the suit, baby!

01:12:41.724 --> 01:12:43.885
No, no, the suit.
All right, the clothes make the man.

01:12:43.959 --> 01:12:47.087
But, you know, you gotta decide
what you wanna do with your life.

01:12:47.162 --> 01:12:49.630
You're gonna go out here, get another...
Next week, he's gonna come back...

01:12:49.698 --> 01:12:51.996
he's gonna be selling
used cars outside.

01:12:52.067 --> 01:12:54.865
- Next week I'm gonna have a record deal.
- You could have a record deal...

01:12:54.937 --> 01:12:57.235
- but you gotta go for it, you know what I mean?
- Like this cigar?

01:12:57.306 --> 01:13:00.298
- I like the cigar.
- I took up smoking.

01:13:00.376 --> 01:13:04.142
There's numerous possibilities for you.
Right? You never know what life's about.

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:06.943
That's your problem. I don't think
you're really realistic, black man.

01:13:07.015 --> 01:13:10.007
- I'm realistic.
- See, last time I was in here, you really pissed me off.

01:13:10.085 --> 01:13:12.144
Hanging around
these white people.

01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:16.658
- Now you got Julio here acting like he's Francois! Please!
- Francois?

01:13:16.725 --> 01:13:19.455
A buddy of mine...
We were ten years old. All right?

01:13:19.528 --> 01:13:22.554
We all dared this guy to go in
and rip off this chicken joint.

01:13:22.631 --> 01:13:26.067
It was owned by this German guy. And we
thought this German guy, he's a real square.

01:13:26.135 --> 01:13:28.729
He's a white guy.
He lived in Harlem, right?

01:13:28.804 --> 01:13:31.864
So we dared the kid to go in.
The kid, he had balls, right?

01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:35.671
He goes in, but the guy
already locked up the night's receipts.

01:13:35.744 --> 01:13:37.712
But he had a little cash
in his pocket.

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:40.715
So the guy, he goes in, he hits the guy
over the head with a bottle.

01:13:40.783 --> 01:13:44.776
He gets his little cash out of the guy's
pocket, leaves him on the floor for dead.

01:13:44.853 --> 01:13:48.186
The guy lives, of course. Kid's ten
years old. Goes home, all right?

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:50.316
His mother says, "Where'd
you get this money?"

01:13:50.392 --> 01:13:52.519
She goes in his room next morning
to wake him up, the money's on the bureau.

01:13:52.594 --> 01:13:56.655
"Where'd you get this money?" He's not
gonna tell her where he got the money, okay?

01:13:56.732 --> 01:14:00.566
She finds out the guy on the corner
was robbed. She puts it together.

01:14:00.636 --> 01:14:04.402
She takes the kid, drags him
by his collar back into the store.

01:14:04.473 --> 01:14:08.204
The guy is there. His head's bandaged.
He's doing his day's business.

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:11.246
She says,
"Did my son rob you?"

01:14:11.313 --> 01:14:14.407
The guy looks at the kid.
"Yeah, I think it was him.

01:14:14.483 --> 01:14:16.678
But it's okay, he's ten
years old, he's young. I don't care."

01:14:16.752 --> 01:14:18.913
She says, "Well, he's yours.
What do you want to do with him?

01:14:18.987 --> 01:14:20.921
"You want to send him to jail?
What do you want to do with him?

01:14:20.989 --> 01:14:22.957
You want him to work for you?
What, what do you want?"

01:14:23.025 --> 01:14:28.327
So he gives the kid a job. The kid sweeps
up the store like Jimmy, every day.

01:14:28.397 --> 01:14:32.333
Then eventually he's washing dishes.
Then eventually he's like cleaning tables.

01:14:32.401 --> 01:14:35.996
I run into this guy,
all right, ten years later.

01:14:36.071 --> 01:14:37.595
I looked at him, I said,
"What are you doin' with yourself?"

01:14:37.673 --> 01:14:39.698
He says, "You know the chicken joint?"
I said, "The chicken joint?

01:14:39.775 --> 01:14:44.303
That was when you were ten years old!"
He says, "I own the place."

01:14:44.379 --> 01:14:48.645
The German guy died,
left him the place...

01:14:48.717 --> 01:14:51.618
and the guy is making money
hand over fist. So you never know, right?

01:14:51.687 --> 01:14:54.781
That's your problem. I'm a black man,
and I got to sell fried chicken.

01:14:54.857 --> 01:14:57.485
That's your problem, man.
I got to be selling chicken.

01:14:57.559 --> 01:15:00.426
- That ain't got nothing to do with my...
- That's not the point.

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:02.589
- I'm trying to make it...
- The point is...

01:15:02.664 --> 01:15:05.929
out of something really horrible,
something really great happened.

01:15:06.001 --> 01:15:09.698
- You got some watermelon too?
- Come on. That's not the point.

01:15:09.771 --> 01:15:13.172
- Okay, that was okay. That was...
- That could happen.

01:15:13.242 --> 01:15:16.302
Relax, I'm jokin'!
I got you. That's good. Thank you.

01:15:16.378 --> 01:15:19.142
- Hey.
- Black people got to stick together, black man.

01:15:19.214 --> 01:15:21.842
- I got a watch.
- Hey, I got one. Check it out.

01:15:21.917 --> 01:15:25.148
Hey, what do you think about the suit?
Hey, hey, hey. ¿Te gusta?

01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:27.154
- Yeah, it's good.
- All right, baby.

01:15:27.222 --> 01:15:30.988
Where's that $10 I gave you last time
I saw you? Remember the $10?

01:15:31.059 --> 01:15:33.425
- You got a short memory. Remember the $10 I gave you?
- Yeah.

01:15:33.495 --> 01:15:36.896
- Whenever you can, you give it back to me, all right?
- Okay. Thanks a lot though.

01:15:36.965 --> 01:15:39.763
- He's got a heart.
- I bought some fried chicken with it.

01:15:39.835 --> 01:15:41.803
I got some good news,
I got some bad news.

01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:46.000
The good news is that you're all here.
The bad news is I'm gonna sing.

01:15:47.643 --> 01:15:53.775
<i>Well I was gonna join the army
when you turned me down</i>

01:15:53.849 --> 01:15:59.151
<i>But I was rejected
so I headed for the river to drown</i>

01:15:59.221 --> 01:16:04.921
<i>Well, I've reconsidered
decided life shouldn't end</i>

01:16:04.993 --> 01:16:07.985
<i>'Cause girls like you
are a dime a dozen</i>

01:16:08.063 --> 01:16:10.088
<i>And I got a nickel to spend</i>

01:16:10.165 --> 01:16:13.692
<i>- Everybody.
- Girls like you are a dime a dozen</i>

01:16:13.769 --> 01:16:17.603
<i>And I got a nickel to spend</i>

01:16:17.673 --> 01:16:23.043
<i>Hey, don't you feel no pity
I'm a-living in paradise</i>

01:16:23.111 --> 01:16:28.743
<i>They say life's a piece of cake,
hell I'm gonna get me a slice</i>

01:16:28.817 --> 01:16:33.049
<i>Well, I see fine chicks all around me
Yeah, I'm getting the urge</i>

01:16:34.623 --> 01:16:37.649
<i>'Cause girls like you
are a dime a dozen</i>

01:16:37.726 --> 01:16:40.286
<i>- And I got a nickel to splurge
- Ya-hoo!</i>

01:16:40.362 --> 01:16:43.297
<i>Yeah, girls like you
are a dime a dozen</i>

01:16:43.365 --> 01:16:46.061
<i>And I got a nickel to splurge</i>

01:16:46.134 --> 01:16:48.932
<i>Yeah, girls like you
are a dime a dozen</i>

01:16:49.004 --> 01:16:51.871
<i>- And I got a nickel to splurge
- Brooklyn style now.</i>

01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:54.670
<i>Yeah, girls like you
are a dime a dozen</i>

01:16:54.743 --> 01:17:01.174
<i>And I got a nickel to splurge</i>

01:18:23.932 --> 01:18:27.561
- Why are you... Why are you still smoking?
- I'm not inhaling.

01:18:41.416 --> 01:18:44.613
- What does it do?
- Stand back, asshole.

01:18:46.488 --> 01:18:49.548
You know, in case you get stuck up
or something, you just pull the fish out.

01:18:58.967 --> 01:19:03.199
That's not food.
That's sugar and... and shit.

01:19:03.271 --> 01:19:06.035
You know what that causes?
Diabetes.

01:19:06.108 --> 01:19:08.099
- Not to me, man.
- Oh, yeah?

01:19:08.176 --> 01:19:10.269
No, 'cause I got
sugar blockers.

01:19:10.345 --> 01:19:22.387
<i>Why can't we be friends</i>

01:19:22.457 --> 01:19:24.448
I'm sittin' out here
readin' the paper...

01:19:24.526 --> 01:19:27.893
To most people it looks like
I'm not doin' a goddamn thing.

01:19:27.963 --> 01:19:32.161
Havin' some coffee, right?
Smokin' a cigar. Hangin' out with Auggie.

01:19:32.234 --> 01:19:35.135
But... they look at me.
They tip their hat.

01:19:35.203 --> 01:19:37.171
"Good morning. How you doin'?"

01:19:37.239 --> 01:19:40.106
They look at you. What do they see?
They think you're a mugger.

01:19:40.175 --> 01:19:42.939
<i>Well, early in the mornin'
Or even when it's late</i>

01:19:43.011 --> 01:19:46.344
<i>I call my baby on the phone
up in the 718</i>

01:19:46.414 --> 01:19:49.713
<i>And I think about the way
that she does love me</i>

01:19:49.785 --> 01:19:51.946
<i>And I wish that
she weren't so hot</i>

01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:54.989
I talk on the phone a lot
so people can't see that I'm black.

01:19:55.056 --> 01:19:57.388
But I really believe that...
I'm Sicilian.

01:19:57.459 --> 01:19:59.723
- No, no, it's good.
- It's good. You like it? Do you believe me?

01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:03.561
- I totally got it.
- I can't get my shoulders out of my frickin' ass here.

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:05.293
<i>Put them all together
we got the same attitude</i>

01:20:05.367 --> 01:20:07.392
<i>Very necessary being rude
That's the Brooklyn mood</i>

01:20:07.469 --> 01:20:09.437
<i>It's the place where
it's hard to shed a tear</i>

01:20:09.504 --> 01:20:13.133
<i>People are filled with little care,
any sympathy you won't find it here</i>

01:20:13.208 --> 01:20:17.269
That's the same problem we had. 'Cause I'm
a black man you don't think I can be Italian!

01:20:21.082 --> 01:20:25.485
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Wish I knew how to say</i>

01:20:27.956 --> 01:20:29.787
I had a friend.
Man, he loved cigarettes so much...

01:20:29.858 --> 01:20:32.418
he used to like set his alarm clock
for the middle of the night.

01:20:32.494 --> 01:20:37.158
Like he'd go to sleep. He'd set it for four
hours later, wake up, have a cigarette.

01:20:54.616 --> 01:20:57.107
Butt me.

01:20:57.185 --> 01:20:59.517
Last pack. Get your
filthy hands off'em!

01:21:42.998 --> 01:21:47.799
<i>When I was a young man
No bigger than this</i>

01:21:47.869 --> 01:21:52.272
<i>A chocolate egg cream
was not to be missed</i>

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:56.436
<i>Some U Bet's chocolate syrup
seltzer water mix it with milk</i>

01:21:56.511 --> 01:22:01.642
<i>You stir it up into a heady froth
Tasty just like silk</i>

01:22:01.716 --> 01:22:06.210
<i>You scream, I steam
We all want egg cream</i>

01:22:09.724 --> 01:22:14.457
<i>You scream, I steam
We all want egg cream</i>

01:22:18.833 --> 01:22:21.028
<i>So the next time
you're in Brooklyn</i>

01:22:21.102 --> 01:22:23.366
<i>Please say hello for me</i>

01:22:23.438 --> 01:22:28.034
<i>At Totonno's for pizza and ice cream
and at Al and Shirley's</i>

01:22:28.109 --> 01:22:30.475
<i>But mostly you go
to Becky's</i>

01:22:30.545 --> 01:22:35.107
<i>Sit in the booth and you say hello,
and have two chocolate egg creams</i>

01:22:35.183 --> 01:22:38.118
<i>One to stay and one to go</i>

01:22:38.186 --> 01:22:42.885
<i>You scream, I steam
We all want egg cream</i>

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:51.661
<i>Ah, you scream, I steam
We all want egg cream</i>

01:22:57.672 --> 01:23:00.869
<i>Yes, directly
from the planet of Brooklyn</i>

01:23:00.942 --> 01:23:04.469
<i>We have Bush Babees
in the house</i>

01:23:04.546 --> 01:23:06.946
<i>In your area
Yes</i>

01:23:07.015 --> 01:23:10.143
<i>Oh, one time for your mom
Yes</i>

01:23:10.218 --> 01:23:12.652
<i>Brooklyn's in the place
Yes</i>

01:23:12.721 --> 01:23:14.951
<i>Go take it to your face</i>
