00:01.569 --> 00:02.429
Mother!

00:02.461 --> 00:04.030
I am not your mother.

00:04.062 --> 00:07.381
This sacrifice was
orchestrated by Mary Sibley.

00:07.383 --> 00:08.070
Mama?

00:08.148 --> 00:09.364
Help me.

00:09.388 --> 00:11.405
Something's happened to her.

00:11.437 --> 00:14.668
Beyond that door lies hell itself.

00:19.281 --> 00:21.170
Let us create a new life for you.

00:21.201 --> 00:22.929
Mary Sibley must pay.

00:22.961 --> 00:24.398
We will be
finished with the problem

00:24.400 --> 00:25.800
called Mary Sibley.

00:25.953 --> 00:27.362
First bring me the rest of her blood.

00:28.148 --> 00:29.390
Be very careful.

00:29.430 --> 00:32.119
The instrument is filled
with Red Mercury.

00:32.852 --> 00:35.381
You must forge a dagger with that in it

00:35.383 --> 00:37.591
and kill him with the dagger.

00:53.736 --> 00:55.560
Almost done.

00:55.591 --> 00:59.049
Then all that remains
is to open the door

00:59.080 --> 01:02.569
and let your spirit return to this body.

01:14.248 --> 01:17.384
By the work of my fingers,
the work of my bone.

01:17.416 --> 01:20.137
Come, Samael, hurry home.

01:20.168 --> 01:22.505
Heed my calling, let
her hear your voice.

01:22.537 --> 01:25.385
The door will be opened,

01:25.417 --> 01:27.625
leave her no choice.

01:32.872 --> 01:34.761
<i>Mother!</i>

01:36.457 --> 01:38.889
<i>Mother! Can you hear me?</i>

01:40.136 --> 01:43.401
<i>Please. Please come to me, Mother!</i>

01:45.159 --> 01:46.568
<i>Please come to me, Mother.</i>

01:46.601 --> 01:49.225
<i>I need you.</i>

01:49.255 --> 01:51.240
<i>Please. Come now.</i>

01:51.271 --> 01:52.329
<i>Come!</i>

01:52.361 --> 01:55.304
<i>Open the door for me, Mother.</i>

01:55.336 --> 01:58.377
<i>So cold here.</i>

01:58.409 --> 01:59.809
<i>Please!</i>

02:09.608 --> 02:11.401

02:11.431 --> 02:12.489

It would be so easy.

03:19.368 --> 03:21.769
An end to all pain.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.808
Open
your eyes to the truth.

03:24.841 --> 03:26.441
Mary doesn't love you.

03:26.472 --> 03:28.776
Stop tormenting me, Mother!

03:28.809 --> 03:31.465
You and your sister
made the same mistake.

03:31.497 --> 03:35.016
Inferior creatures mix their
blood to strain out impurities.

03:35.048 --> 03:38.601
But Marburg blood is
already purer than pure.

03:38.633 --> 03:41.641
Precisely because we <i>never</i> dilute it.

03:41.671 --> 03:44.009
I don't understand.

03:44.040 --> 03:46.921
No. But you will learn.

03:46.952 --> 03:49.736
The only heart your heart truly needs

03:49.768 --> 03:51.656
is the heart of a Marburg.

03:51.688 --> 03:54.121
Tell me what I must do, Mother.

03:54.151 --> 03:58.088
First, give me more of Mary's blood.

04:08.232 --> 04:11.048
Mrs. Hathorne.

04:12.647 --> 04:14.088
Mr. Lewis.

04:14.119 --> 04:17.288
Incorrigible.

04:21.896 --> 04:25.257
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

04:36.039 --> 04:39.177
Before you go, Reverend,

04:39.209 --> 04:42.249
you're a happily married man.

04:42.280 --> 04:44.936
What is your parting advice to us

04:44.968 --> 04:47.945
as we begin this journey of marriage?

04:47.976 --> 04:51.561
Marriage? Mm.

04:52.841 --> 04:55.977
Marriage is a door...

04:56.008 --> 04:59.785
that opens on to both heaven and hell.

04:59.817 --> 05:03.336
And it may be that the
greatest happiness is found

05:03.367 --> 05:07.049
by lingering on the threshold
for as long as possible.

05:07.080 --> 05:10.248
I think you most fortunate in your wife.

05:10.281 --> 05:12.201
Such a resourceful woman.

05:12.232 --> 05:13.864
Willing to do most anything

05:13.896 --> 05:16.265
to ensure the success of her marriage.

05:16.296 --> 05:19.017
She has indeed done the
one thing most critical

05:19.048 --> 05:21.321
to our marriage... ensured
that it bore fruit.

05:21.352 --> 05:25.032
And for <i>that,</i> I am grateful.

05:27.592 --> 05:29.704
Mmm.

05:29.737 --> 05:33.289
We can't let you go without due
pay for your ministerial duties.

05:33.321 --> 05:34.729
No, that is not necessary.

05:34.760 --> 05:36.904
I think there might be
one bird in particular

05:36.936 --> 05:38.600
to your liking.

05:38.633 --> 05:41.129
She usually lingers in the
furthest chaise downstairs.

05:41.160 --> 05:43.144
No, thank you. I have sworn off such...

05:43.177 --> 05:45.801
No harm in gazing, is there?

05:45.832 --> 05:48.265
Even if it is only to give
you something to think about

05:48.295 --> 05:50.056
next time you're with your lovely wife.

05:50.089 --> 05:53.577
After all, it doesn't matter
where you gain your appetite,

05:53.608 --> 05:56.202
as long as you dine at home.

06:09.767 --> 06:11.208
The, uh, friend who arrived with me...

06:11.240 --> 06:12.489
have you seen him?

06:12.520 --> 06:14.408
Kept asking for oranges.
Took leave long ago.

06:14.441 --> 06:16.072
Thank you.

06:33.768 --> 06:36.329
Gloriana.

06:36.359 --> 06:38.057
Good evening, sir.

06:38.089 --> 06:40.137
Or is it morning? I never know.

06:40.168 --> 06:41.833
"Sir"?

06:45.480 --> 06:48.136
After all we've been to each other,

06:48.168 --> 06:49.704
have we come to that?

06:49.735 --> 06:51.336
I'm sorry.

06:51.367 --> 06:54.536
Oughtn't I call you "sir"? Or is it...

06:54.568 --> 06:56.968
I'm new. I'm still learning.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.529
Time was I would've
delighted in such games...

06:59.561 --> 07:01.416
you pretending to be the novice.

07:01.447 --> 07:03.080
But we've so little time.

07:03.112 --> 07:04.616
Please...

07:04.647 --> 07:06.408
come.

07:11.528 --> 07:13.608
I'm sorry, sir, but do I know you?

07:13.640 --> 07:16.490
Know me? What a question!

07:18.087 --> 07:19.688
There... do you know me now?

07:19.720 --> 07:22.280
I... I don't know what to say.

07:22.313 --> 07:24.521
Oh, no? Then I'll help you.

07:29.833 --> 07:31.881
Did I do it wrong?

07:31.913 --> 07:33.897
I'm so... Please
don't tell Mercy.

07:33.928 --> 07:37.576
I-I'm so confused. I just...

07:37.609 --> 07:40.361
I'm sure I'll get the feel for it soon.

07:40.392 --> 07:44.104
I think I'm supposed
to charge for a kiss.

07:44.136 --> 07:46.056
But I can't even remember how much.

07:46.088 --> 07:47.721
How much do you think kisses cost?

07:47.752 --> 07:50.697
Depends on whom you kiss.

07:50.727 --> 07:54.888
Some are priceless and yet cost nothing.

07:54.920 --> 07:58.601
Others are a curse and
you pay for a lifetime.

07:58.632 --> 08:00.456
Sir, please...

08:00.487 --> 08:02.985
I'm sorry. I don't mean to confuse you.

08:03.016 --> 08:05.225
I love you.

08:05.256 --> 08:06.824
I never stopped loving you.

08:06.855 --> 08:09.096
Please, remember me... remember us!

08:11.655 --> 08:13.160
I'm sorry,

08:13.192 --> 08:16.776
but I... I cannot be the girl
that you think me to be.

08:16.808 --> 08:20.361
I'm sure as confused as I... feel,

08:20.392 --> 08:22.504
I could never forget a fine
gentleman such as yourself.

08:22.537 --> 08:24.297
Okay, all right... you
don't remember me.

08:24.327 --> 08:25.895
Fine. Um...

08:25.927 --> 08:28.583
What do you remember?

08:28.615 --> 08:30.599
How did you come to be here?

08:30.632 --> 08:32.808
I remember nothing

08:32.841 --> 08:36.616
before a... nice woman put
me in Mercy's keeping.

08:36.647 --> 08:38.344
What woman?

08:38.375 --> 08:40.777
Hair redder than mine.

08:40.808 --> 08:44.903
In a nice house on the common...

08:44.936 --> 08:47.784
with real china and the softest voice.

08:47.816 --> 08:50.824
An angel she was.

08:50.856 --> 08:54.568
I've learned that there is
more than one kind of angel.

08:56.841 --> 08:58.665
Gloriana, believe me,

08:58.695 --> 09:01.448
whether you remember or not,
we have loved each other.

09:01.479 --> 09:04.296
We have known each other.

09:04.328 --> 09:06.089
And I will help you.

09:14.407 --> 09:17.447
I do feel as if I have seen you,

09:17.479 --> 09:19.881
perhaps in a dream.

09:21.607 --> 09:23.944
Though dreams, of course, are nonsense.

09:23.976 --> 09:27.784
No, dreams are not nonsense.

09:27.816 --> 09:30.440
Sometimes they even come true.

09:35.079 --> 09:36.776
Take this.

09:36.808 --> 09:38.407
Hide it.

09:38.439 --> 09:40.104
Do not show Mercy or the others.

09:40.135 --> 09:42.088
They will take it from you.

09:42.120 --> 09:44.519
Surely a kiss from me doesn't
cost nearly this much.

09:44.552 --> 09:45.952
No, not enough.

09:48.808 --> 09:50.856
I will return for you. I promise.

09:50.888 --> 09:52.807
Tomorrow.

09:52.839 --> 09:55.753
If there is a tomorrow, I will be here.

09:58.280 --> 10:01.576
Perhaps you and I <i>are</i>
meant for each other.

10:01.608 --> 10:03.208
You seem to have lost your tomorrow,

10:03.241 --> 10:05.864
and I all my yesterdays.

10:05.896 --> 10:08.297
Seeing you has given me the strength

10:08.327 --> 10:10.664
to fight for all of our tomorrows.

10:10.696 --> 10:14.536
And I must also pay your angel a visit.

10:14.568 --> 10:17.993
Thank her for all that
she's done for you.

10:27.207 --> 10:28.607
John?

10:29.287 --> 10:31.048
John.

10:35.079 --> 10:37.001
Oh, thank God!

10:38.887 --> 10:40.584
Where is he?

10:40.615 --> 10:44.456
Sent back to hell...
mumbling of oranges.

10:49.127 --> 10:51.049
I knew I had to kill him.

10:51.080 --> 10:53.288
But to tell you the truth, in the end...

10:53.319 --> 10:57.128
I... I almost felt bad.

10:58.855 --> 11:01.000
Like I had slaughtered some great beast

11:01.031 --> 11:03.881
whose like we shall never see again.

11:03.912 --> 11:07.176
I felt like Judas himself
leading him to you.

11:09.480 --> 11:11.048
The knife.

11:11.079 --> 11:13.095
Wait. This...

11:13.127 --> 11:16.775
He said... whoever set
me up with the knife...

11:17.927 --> 11:19.327
Ohh.

11:20.775 --> 11:24.359
Only an angel knows
how to kill an angel.

11:24.391 --> 11:26.504
But Tituba told you.

11:26.535 --> 11:28.967
You think Tituba in
league with the devil?

11:29.000 --> 11:31.848
He had no reason to lie.

11:31.879 --> 11:34.345
And the Red Mercury is still
set to destroy Salem.

11:34.376 --> 11:35.624
And everything around it.

11:35.655 --> 11:37.416
We've got to find it.
It could be anywhere.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.079
- We need to tend to your wounds first.
- There's no time.

11:39.112 --> 11:40.648
There may be no time,

11:40.680 --> 11:42.408
but I will not have you
die before we solve this.

11:48.071 --> 11:50.888
We can't count on Sebastian
to help us, but...

11:50.920 --> 11:53.289
soon as I get out of here

11:53.319 --> 11:56.135
I'll tear the town apart looking for it.

11:56.168 --> 11:57.960
I'll get word to Mary of all this.

11:57.992 --> 12:00.744
Do you have any message
you want me to give her?

12:00.775 --> 12:03.463
She loves you, John.
You cannot doubt that.

12:03.495 --> 12:06.088
When it comes to Mary
I've learned the hard way

12:06.121 --> 12:09.128
you <i>can</i> doubt everything.

12:09.160 --> 12:12.584
Especially when it comes to love.

12:12.615 --> 12:16.488
I just want to see dirty old
Salem survive till Monday.

12:16.519 --> 12:19.336
If I'm still alive, I'm going to
get the hell away from here...

12:19.368 --> 12:20.872
and her.

12:22.855 --> 12:24.713
Forever.

12:28.135 --> 12:30.120
Back <i>again.</i>

12:30.152 --> 12:31.656
I must say, Mr. Alden,

12:31.688 --> 12:35.656
you could keep a surgeon in
business all by yourself.

12:35.687 --> 12:38.280
Just sew me up. Fast.

12:40.167 --> 12:42.760
Indeed.

12:42.791 --> 12:45.384
I will be quick.

12:45.415 --> 12:47.688
'Cause there is no time to waste.

12:47.720 --> 12:50.248
What was that?

12:50.280 --> 12:52.617
<i>I</i> will make haste.

13:08.742 --> 13:09.804
<i>So you're really leavin.</i>

13:09.867 --> 13:11.499
<i>Mary, trust me...</i>

13:11.835 --> 13:13.627
<i>I will come back for you.</i>

13:16.699 --> 13:19.516
You did love me, didn't you, John?

13:19.546 --> 13:22.492
Do you still?

13:22.523 --> 13:25.083
<i>Mary, trust me.</i>

13:26.820 --> 13:28.348
Come back.

13:33.820 --> 13:35.612
Mary.

13:39.356 --> 13:41.020
You are not well.

13:41.051 --> 13:44.060
Let us get you back to your bed.

13:44.092 --> 13:45.340
No.

13:45.371 --> 13:48.060
I am the guardian of the threshold.

13:48.091 --> 13:51.419
I wait for him.

13:51.451 --> 13:53.821
Mary, how long have you been like this?

13:55.260 --> 13:56.892
What has happened to you?

13:58.588 --> 14:00.477
I don't know.

14:00.507 --> 14:03.035
I don't know. I don't know.

14:03.067 --> 14:04.668
I don't know.

14:06.299 --> 14:09.147
Perhaps killing him took
what life I had left.

14:09.180 --> 14:12.187
Perhaps I return to the
grave they took me from.

14:12.219 --> 14:15.419
But I shall not go until I am sure.

14:19.452 --> 14:21.468
He calls to me.

14:24.379 --> 14:27.420
Do you hear him?

14:27.452 --> 14:29.789
Who?

14:29.819 --> 14:32.316
He talks to me.

14:35.707 --> 14:37.693
My monster.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.076
My son.

14:42.107 --> 14:43.355
Mary.

14:43.387 --> 14:45.149
My son.

14:45.180 --> 14:47.484
We will not let him out.

14:47.515 --> 14:48.763
No.

14:48.796 --> 14:51.548
No, I will kill him again. And again.

14:51.580 --> 14:54.268
And again. And again. And
as many times as it takes!

14:54.300 --> 14:55.548
- No, I won't!
- Mary!

14:55.579 --> 14:57.788
- Never!
- Mary, listen to me. Please.

14:57.819 --> 14:59.516
We've but one task left!

14:59.548 --> 15:01.948
We need to find the weapon.

15:01.979 --> 15:03.227
Now.

15:03.259 --> 15:04.795
Where is Sebastian?

15:04.827 --> 15:06.235
I've not seen him.

15:08.316 --> 15:09.820
But John...

15:09.852 --> 15:12.189
John did it.

15:12.219 --> 15:13.979
He slew the dark angel.

15:14.012 --> 15:15.995
So you've seen him.

15:16.027 --> 15:17.467
Yes.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.467
Did he have a word for me?

15:23.740 --> 15:25.916
Of course he did.

15:25.948 --> 15:27.867
He thinks only of you.

15:27.900 --> 15:29.300
It keeps him going.

15:29.307 --> 15:31.580
He... He can't live without you.

15:31.611 --> 15:33.563
Ohh.

15:33.595 --> 15:36.188
My sweet messenger.

15:36.220 --> 15:38.044
That was all I needed to hear.

15:38.075 --> 15:40.381
Mary. Mary. Mary, listen.

15:40.412 --> 15:43.419
John also said that the Sentinel,

15:43.452 --> 15:45.403
before he died, he told
him that only an angel

15:45.435 --> 15:46.845
knew how to slay another angel.

15:46.876 --> 15:48.284
Mm?

15:48.316 --> 15:50.907
John believes that he was
sent to kill the dark angel

15:50.940 --> 15:54.075
by... by someone who was in
league with the devil himself.

15:54.107 --> 15:58.269
We have been guided by a traitor's hand.

15:58.299 --> 16:00.028
Yes.

16:00.059 --> 16:01.500
Tituba.

16:01.531 --> 16:04.283
Tituba?

16:04.315 --> 16:05.724
You knew?

16:05.755 --> 16:07.227
I feared.

16:07.259 --> 16:08.828
If Tituba be in league with the devil,

16:08.860 --> 16:11.068
she will seek to somehow unite his soul

16:11.099 --> 16:12.444
with his body once more.

16:12.476 --> 16:15.197
And I will be waiting.

16:16.860 --> 16:18.941
I'll be back, Mary.

16:46.491 --> 16:47.891
Ah! Jesus!

16:47.900 --> 16:50.109
I do apologize.

16:53.756 --> 16:55.228
You know,

16:55.260 --> 16:58.908
in all the years I've known you, Dinley,

16:58.939 --> 17:01.564
I've never seen you drunk.

17:01.595 --> 17:03.195
Or nervous.

17:03.227 --> 17:05.915
Now you're both.

17:27.036 --> 17:29.084
- Any sign of Dorcas?
- No, sir.

17:29.115 --> 17:30.876
'Fraid no one's seen her.

17:30.908 --> 17:33.084
But we won't stop looking for her.

17:33.115 --> 17:35.228
If we can't protect an
innocent little girl,

17:35.260 --> 17:36.348
what good are we?

17:36.378 --> 17:38.588
You men?

17:38.620 --> 17:40.860
Protect innocent girls?

17:40.891 --> 17:43.580
Who do you think we
need protection from?

17:43.611 --> 17:47.515
Mercy sent you.

17:47.546 --> 17:49.629
She knows how to protect girls.

17:49.659 --> 17:51.548
Where's Dorcas? Is she alive?

17:51.579 --> 17:54.268
She was when I left her.

17:54.299 --> 17:56.507
Let's go, men!

17:56.538 --> 17:58.332
Her new Dollie.

18:07.036 --> 18:09.116
What did you say?

18:09.148 --> 18:11.388
Mercy said...

18:11.420 --> 18:13.467
that little girl is her new Dollie.

18:13.499 --> 18:17.020
And if you want her back,
you have to come alone.

18:18.300 --> 18:20.348
Let her go. Let her go.

18:20.380 --> 18:23.324
I won't take any hostages.

18:23.355 --> 18:25.148
It wouldn't do any good anyway.

18:25.179 --> 18:27.196
Mercy wouldn't lift a finger for you.

18:27.227 --> 18:29.499
That ain't true! She loves us!

18:29.531 --> 18:31.261
Saved us all from lives of misery

18:31.292 --> 18:34.043
at the hands of sodding men like you!

18:34.075 --> 18:35.484
You know,

18:35.516 --> 18:39.419
I wish I could say you
were wrong about most men.

18:39.452 --> 18:43.260
But seeking shelter in
that witch's bosom?

18:43.291 --> 18:45.309
Take your pick...

18:45.339 --> 18:49.117
fire or frying pan!

18:55.099 --> 18:57.244
Husband.

18:57.275 --> 18:59.580
It feels like you've been gone forever.

18:59.612 --> 19:01.820
I pray you achieved all you hoped?

19:09.340 --> 19:11.420
You are drunk.

19:11.452 --> 19:13.307
Yes.

19:13.339 --> 19:16.924
But before long I will be sober...

19:16.956 --> 19:19.260
and <i>you...</i>

19:19.291 --> 19:23.259
will forever be a lying, vile,

19:23.291 --> 19:25.692
evil bitch.

19:27.100 --> 19:28.508
Cotton!

19:28.540 --> 19:31.835
Did you know that I was in love once?

19:33.339 --> 19:34.907
Before we met.

19:34.940 --> 19:37.436
Love? No.

19:37.467 --> 19:40.603
I-I knew in your wild youth

19:40.636 --> 19:43.260
you spent a lot of time with...
women of the night...

19:43.292 --> 19:44.700
Oh, no, not women.

19:44.732 --> 19:46.301
One woman.

19:47.771 --> 19:49.563
Oh, yes.

19:49.595 --> 19:53.244
I remember your father bundling one away

19:53.275 --> 19:55.003
for the sake of your family honor.

19:55.035 --> 19:56.539
Mm. So you do remember.

19:56.572 --> 19:57.972
Vaguely.

20:01.307 --> 20:03.483
You've not seen her recently?

20:03.515 --> 20:05.596
Of course not.

20:05.627 --> 20:07.868
You know, I think that lying

20:07.899 --> 20:10.107
is a worse sin than murder.

20:10.138 --> 20:11.420
You see, if you kill a man

20:11.450 --> 20:13.147
you at least leave him in God's hands,

20:13.180 --> 20:15.708
but if you lie to him...

20:15.738 --> 20:18.267
you imprison him...

20:18.300 --> 20:22.875
forever in a false world.

20:22.907 --> 20:24.540
So do not lie to me.

20:24.571 --> 20:25.819
Tell me.

20:25.851 --> 20:29.819
Did you or did you not meet Gloriana?

20:31.132 --> 20:33.148
Is that her name?

20:33.179 --> 20:35.196
Gloriana?

20:35.228 --> 20:36.540
I didn't know.

20:36.571 --> 20:39.643
Yes, I did.
I did meet her.

20:39.675 --> 20:42.588
She was looking for you.
I tried to help her.

20:42.618 --> 20:45.275
I said do not lie to me.

20:45.307 --> 20:46.707
I am not lying.

20:46.714 --> 20:50.107
When I found her in the
camp, she was changed.

20:50.140 --> 20:51.739
She was hardened, angry.

20:51.771 --> 20:53.756
She was determined to
ruin your good name.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.186
You saw her as a threat.

20:55.195 --> 20:57.467
Yes. To you.

20:57.500 --> 20:59.547
To us. To everything we hoped for.

20:59.579 --> 21:02.587
What threat could a fallen
woman possibly have

21:02.619 --> 21:06.043
that would damage my
reputation so terribly?

21:06.075 --> 21:08.796
You're heir to the
richest, most powerful,

21:08.827 --> 21:12.603
most influential, respected
families in the realm.

21:12.634 --> 21:15.099
And yet you... you have the instinct

21:15.132 --> 21:17.308
for self-preservation of a cloud.

21:17.338 --> 21:21.019
You float above all the real
slings and arrows of the world

21:21.052 --> 21:24.444
and you simply have no idea.

21:26.140 --> 21:28.828
Thank goodness my eyes were pried open

21:28.859 --> 21:30.460
and you had me to watch out for you.

21:30.492 --> 21:35.228
Because you cannot imagine what
that would have done to us...

21:35.260 --> 21:37.628
that woman and her child.

21:39.099 --> 21:40.539
Child?

21:40.571 --> 21:44.189
Her child?

21:47.516 --> 21:51.036
Oh, my God.

21:51.068 --> 21:53.659
Oh, my God. I'm going to be sick.

21:56.059 --> 22:00.155
You did not hasten that tiny life...

22:00.187 --> 22:02.939
you stole hers.

22:02.971 --> 22:05.242
No, Котънn. It is not what you think.

22:05.275 --> 22:06.555
She was dying. And the baby...

22:06.587 --> 22:09.372
Stop lying!

22:11.195 --> 22:12.956
Please, you must believe me.

22:12.988 --> 22:14.396
I... I couldn't bear...

22:14.426 --> 22:15.675
Stop it! Stop it!

22:15.708 --> 22:18.141
- Do not say that!
- I did this for you!

22:22.428 --> 22:23.900
You will return that child.

22:23.931 --> 22:25.596
You will return the child to Gloriana.

22:25.628 --> 22:27.260
You will restore her mind.

22:27.291 --> 22:29.147
You will return the child, and
you will restore her mind!

22:29.179 --> 22:30.876
- I cannot!
- Yes, you must!

22:30.906 --> 22:33.819
- What's done is done!
- Done?!

22:33.851 --> 22:36.507
Then with it, every atom of love

22:36.540 --> 22:39.036
that I've ever felt for you is gone!

22:42.396 --> 22:45.020
Does your God not forgive all?

22:45.051 --> 22:47.548
God may forgive. God may forgive all.

22:47.578 --> 22:48.978
But I won't!

22:51.292 --> 22:53.980
No.

22:54.012 --> 22:55.324
Please.

22:55.354 --> 22:58.588
Do not take away...

22:58.619 --> 23:02.075
the possibility that you
might love me again one day.

23:02.108 --> 23:03.868
Cotton, please.

23:03.899 --> 23:06.812
No matter how far off.

23:08.732 --> 23:12.380
If you do, I am afraid...

23:12.412 --> 23:16.379
What could a thing like
you possibly fear?

23:16.412 --> 23:19.260
What I will become.

23:19.291 --> 23:22.940
I used to long for your porcelain skin.

23:27.580 --> 23:30.204
Your soft lips.

23:30.235 --> 23:33.148
Your purity, your innocence.

23:34.236 --> 23:36.828
Your heart.

23:36.859 --> 23:38.843
Now...

23:38.875 --> 23:40.443
Now...

23:40.474 --> 23:44.540
all I see before me is a hideous hag.

23:52.572 --> 23:54.619
Yes.

23:54.652 --> 23:56.796
Of course.

23:56.828 --> 23:59.804
That is what we women are to you.

23:59.835 --> 24:02.715
A good woman is half doll, half angel,

24:02.746 --> 24:06.075
and a bad woman is but a hideous fiend.

24:08.956 --> 24:12.827
Well, I would not be your
angel-doll a second longer,

24:12.859 --> 24:15.579
even if I could.

24:15.611 --> 24:18.043
I would rather be a fiend.

24:18.075 --> 24:20.220
A great fiend!

24:23.579 --> 24:27.004
You shameless hypocrite.

24:27.035 --> 24:33.115
You, who persecuted and
executed so many innocents.

24:33.147 --> 24:37.178
You, who murdered your own father.

24:37.211 --> 24:42.556
You, who say the worst
sin of all is a lie...

24:42.587 --> 24:45.563
and your entire life is a lie!

24:45.595 --> 24:47.642
Every time you climbed the pulpit

24:47.675 --> 24:49.884
after a night of drunken debauchery,

24:49.914 --> 24:52.859
you lied to everyone!

24:52.890 --> 24:58.555
Or is lying merely another
privilege reserved for men?

25:05.531 --> 25:11.100
Your world is so black and white.

25:11.130 --> 25:13.467
What it needs is some color.

25:15.387 --> 25:18.780
What's black and white and red all over?

25:18.811 --> 25:22.235
A Puritan in the hands of
my lovely, angry sister.

25:26.938 --> 25:30.234
Calm yourself. We may need him yet.

25:30.266 --> 25:32.348
You have longed for the death of Cotton.

25:32.379 --> 25:33.779
Why stop me now?

25:34.616 --> 25:35.676
True, I've long wanted to silence

25:35.707 --> 25:37.275
that pretentious mouth of his.

25:37.307 --> 25:39.548
But I've recently and
humbly been reminded

25:39.578 --> 25:41.595
that I do not always know best...

25:41.626 --> 25:43.899
and one wiser than us
believes the Dark Lord

25:43.930 --> 25:45.468
is not through with him.

25:45.498 --> 25:48.795
Whose sage wisdom rules you?

25:48.827 --> 25:51.579
Why, Mother, of course.

25:51.611 --> 25:53.339
Mother?

25:53.371 --> 25:55.868
How?

25:55.899 --> 25:57.626
Let me show you.

25:57.659 --> 26:00.220
And what of Cotton?

26:06.299 --> 26:09.276
Kept somewhere he can
cause no more harm.

26:09.308 --> 26:10.876
Until he's needed.

26:14.778 --> 26:16.667
Come, sister.

26:16.698 --> 26:18.875
Mother is waiting.

26:27.196 --> 26:29.307
Let me out!

26:29.338 --> 26:31.900
Hey! Let me out!

26:31.930 --> 26:33.915
Let me out!

26:44.307 --> 26:46.034
Good day.

26:46.067 --> 26:48.148
Apple?

27:28.627 --> 27:30.836
Thank God.

27:30.868 --> 27:33.139
Thank <i>me.</i>

27:34.419 --> 27:37.235
I so wanted to puncture her skin,

27:37.267 --> 27:39.891
so plump and perfect.

27:39.923 --> 27:42.996
It's not like you to deny
yourself any pleasure.

27:43.026 --> 27:47.026
True, but I am no child now...

27:47.059 --> 27:49.587
and have learned the art of
delaying my gratification...

27:49.618 --> 27:52.916
in the name of even greater pleasure.

27:52.947 --> 27:55.666
Free her.

27:55.699 --> 27:59.316
And I am a woman of business now, too.

27:59.346 --> 28:02.452
Everything has a price, Isaac.

28:02.482 --> 28:05.267
In this case, your life for hers.

28:16.403 --> 28:18.355
What say you, boss?

28:18.387 --> 28:21.652
Our man of the people.

28:21.682 --> 28:23.892
How could I not see that
you were the very worm

28:23.923 --> 28:25.778
at the apple's core?

28:25.811 --> 28:27.828
Always turning me away from my course.

28:27.858 --> 28:29.875
For your own good.

28:29.906 --> 28:32.371
I tried to warn you, Isaac,

28:32.403 --> 28:35.699
but you're like a moth to the flame.

28:35.731 --> 28:37.012
Hell-bent on it!

28:37.043 --> 28:40.371
Time is money, and you have neither.

28:40.402 --> 28:41.811
You let her go,

28:41.842 --> 28:43.242
and I will stay behind for you to do

28:43.250 --> 28:44.339
whatever it is you want me.

28:44.371 --> 28:45.460
No.

28:53.746 --> 28:56.658
No. No. No.

28:58.386 --> 29:00.467
I'm not going.

29:00.499 --> 29:02.355
Listen to me.

29:02.386 --> 29:04.434
I want you to run home
as fast as you can,

29:04.467 --> 29:05.555
and not look back.

29:05.586 --> 29:07.154
Go. Go!

29:07.187 --> 29:08.531
I cannot lose you!

29:08.562 --> 29:12.019
You won't. You can't. You found me.

29:12.050 --> 29:15.027
When I was lost and had no
way to find my way back.

29:15.058 --> 29:19.379
Trust that whatever happens,
I will always be with you.

29:19.410 --> 29:22.195
But my heart will break if you die.

29:22.227 --> 29:25.395
Listen to me.

29:25.427 --> 29:26.836
You are a young girl,

29:26.867 --> 29:29.012
but you got the strongest
heart I ever seen.

29:30.867 --> 29:33.811
I didn't save you, Dorcas. You saved me.

29:33.842 --> 29:38.386
Even here, now... this is you saving me.

29:56.723 --> 29:58.932
Fear not. You can trust me.

29:58.963 --> 30:00.659
Trust? You?

30:00.691 --> 30:02.546
Two words that have lived so far
apart are now to be neighbors?

30:02.579 --> 30:03.635
How strange.

30:03.667 --> 30:05.107
Neighbors?

30:05.138 --> 30:06.291
We're much closer than that.

30:06.323 --> 30:07.635
We're children of the same flesh.

30:07.666 --> 30:10.035
Perhaps, but the flesh
that once birthed us

30:10.067 --> 30:13.395
is now dead, and I do not
believe in waking the dead.

30:13.427 --> 30:17.171
No need. She sleeps not.

30:17.203 --> 30:19.700
Please. Come. See.

30:19.731 --> 30:21.747
We are our mother's children.

30:21.779 --> 30:25.267
We still have much to learn
from her and from each other.

30:25.298 --> 30:27.571
I watched you just now with Mather,

30:27.602 --> 30:30.867
and I can already tell you
are far in advance of me.

30:32.531 --> 30:35.571
In what way?

30:35.603 --> 30:38.131
In that precious alchemy

30:38.162 --> 30:41.746
of transmuting agony into anger.

30:41.779 --> 30:44.915
Pain into power.

30:44.946 --> 30:49.427
See, we are two people
who have done anything

30:49.458 --> 30:50.771
and everything for love.

30:50.802 --> 30:53.811
Only to have love turn upon us.

30:57.490 --> 31:01.106
I knew he wasn't remotely worthy of you.

31:01.139 --> 31:04.626
But I couldn't understand
then why my flesh crawled

31:04.659 --> 31:06.067
every time he touched you.

31:06.099 --> 31:09.107
But I know now.

31:09.139 --> 31:13.939
His were not the proper
hands to touch you.

31:18.578 --> 31:20.146
What...

31:20.179 --> 31:21.715
what wicked game is this?

31:21.747 --> 31:23.571
It's no game.

31:23.603 --> 31:26.900
Our mother calls.

31:26.931 --> 31:29.620
And it is time we really listen.

31:29.651 --> 31:31.635
My dearest daughter.

31:31.667 --> 31:33.555
My sweet son.

31:33.587 --> 31:36.051
That's it.

31:36.082 --> 31:38.674
Your two broken hearts shall be healed

31:38.706 --> 31:41.075
into one mighty weapon.

31:41.106 --> 31:42.674
Help me, children.

31:42.707 --> 31:46.130
Come close and let me feel
the power of your kiss.

32:02.226 --> 32:04.915
Thank you, children.

32:04.946 --> 32:08.180
Now, Sebastian... leave us.

32:08.210 --> 32:10.963
I would speak to my special one, alone.

32:40.562 --> 32:42.994
You think I
wouldn't recognize you?

32:43.025 --> 32:45.874
I see you. You bitch.

32:46.802 --> 32:48.467
You cannot hide from me.

32:52.147 --> 32:54.547
Yes, sister. Follow.

32:54.579 --> 32:57.812
Step away, far away from the door.

33:15.166 --> 33:18.974
See? Here's the thing.

33:19.557 --> 33:24.197
What terrifies normal people,
you find interesting.

33:24.228 --> 33:25.957
So tell me...

33:25.988 --> 33:29.348
what could possibly
scare a man like you?

33:29.381 --> 33:31.002
Hmm?

33:31.120 --> 33:33.423
I think what scares you...

33:33.455 --> 33:36.719
is the very same thing that scares me...

33:36.750 --> 33:40.207
Armageddon time.

33:40.239 --> 33:42.385
Boom!

33:45.071 --> 33:48.047
You was planning on
leaving when I got here.

33:48.079 --> 33:50.864
Thought you'd go someplace
safe when it...

33:50.895 --> 33:52.880
<i>it</i> happens.

33:55.695 --> 33:56.911
So where is it?

33:56.943 --> 33:58.159
Hmm?

34:01.424 --> 34:03.953
If you don't tell me...

34:03.984 --> 34:06.384
I'm gonna make sure you
die like the rest of us!

34:06.415 --> 34:09.072
No, no, no. Don't.

34:09.103 --> 34:10.192
Don't.

34:10.224 --> 34:11.984
Well?

34:15.663 --> 34:17.263
Shh.

34:19.023 --> 34:21.520
Listen.

34:29.840 --> 34:32.272
I'm here, Little Master.

34:32.304 --> 34:33.583
I am here.

34:33.616 --> 34:35.087
Soon you will be free

34:35.119 --> 34:37.679
and all your promises to
me will be fulfilled.

34:37.710 --> 34:39.344
I will bask in the hot sun

34:39.375 --> 34:42.384
while this wicked
civilization burns under you.

34:42.416 --> 34:47.630
A most fatal error,
my treacherous sister...

34:47.663 --> 34:49.806
placing your trust in the Dark Lord

34:49.840 --> 34:52.112
and this mangy mouser.

34:57.423 --> 34:58.959
Blind me if you will.

34:58.992 --> 35:02.225
I can track and kill you
in the darkest night.

35:05.296 --> 35:06.928
Why?

35:06.960 --> 35:10.384
The Dark Lord betrayed you as
much if not more than anyone.

35:10.415 --> 35:12.784
Why come crawling back to save him?

35:14.352 --> 35:17.168
Because he is the only
power strong enough

35:17.198 --> 35:19.503
to give you all what you deserve.

35:19.535 --> 35:22.351
Revenge is sweet, I know.

35:22.384 --> 35:23.888
And I understand your pain

35:23.918 --> 35:25.904
at the loss of your family and land...

35:27.054 --> 35:28.368
Save your pity.

35:28.399 --> 35:30.128
You understand nothing.

35:30.159 --> 35:32.624
It is not revenge I seek

35:32.656 --> 35:34.831
any more than a surgeon seeks revenge

35:34.864 --> 35:36.592
on the carcinoma he removes.

35:36.624 --> 35:39.600
You people are the carcinoma.

35:39.631 --> 35:42.063
You cannot hate the
Puritans more than I.

35:42.095 --> 35:45.040
Were it only a matter of Puritans.

35:45.071 --> 35:47.087
They are but one tiny tribe

35:47.119 --> 35:50.064
of you criminals,
murderers, and hypocrites.

35:50.095 --> 35:54.512
You set out from your lands
to discover the world...

35:54.543 --> 35:57.360
as if the world wasn't known
to the people who lived there.

35:57.391 --> 36:01.519
Every place you people set
foot on this earth is a crime!

36:01.552 --> 36:03.312
And then you have the audacity

36:03.343 --> 36:05.007
to complain when others would dare

36:05.039 --> 36:07.792
to treat you with the same
cold, calculating slaughter

36:07.824 --> 36:11.984
that you have dealt every
other people in this world.

36:15.055 --> 36:16.751
Believe it or not,

36:16.783 --> 36:19.664
I am truly sorry that you must be lost

36:19.695 --> 36:21.808
in the storm...

36:21.840 --> 36:23.792
but I know you, Mary.

36:23.824 --> 36:27.343
You are too smart not to see
that what is coming is no crime,

36:27.375 --> 36:29.327
but justice.

36:29.359 --> 36:33.520
Cruel perhaps, but justice.

36:33.551 --> 36:35.280
Indeed.

36:36.495 --> 36:37.551
'Tis Judgement day

36:37.584 --> 36:39.728
and time for justice to be served.

36:39.759 --> 36:41.744
Goodbye, Mary.

36:41.776 --> 36:44.752
You may yet survive this,
and I hope you do.

36:44.784 --> 36:47.535
You have done your duty. Now leave us.

36:53.455 --> 36:55.151
Sebastian.

36:55.183 --> 36:57.872
You made a terrible mistake.

36:57.902 --> 36:59.984
I really would have loved you forever.

37:00.015 --> 37:04.367
But you remained loyal to a
man utterly unworthy of you.

37:04.399 --> 37:07.887
Did you ever consider what a
future with John Alden held?

37:07.919 --> 37:10.799
I see it clearly.

37:10.830 --> 37:13.328
He has gone to paunch.

37:13.358 --> 37:16.143
His breath smells of
dead meat and sour wine.

37:16.175 --> 37:19.087
And your ocean of love for him is as dry

37:19.118 --> 37:20.751
as his is limp for you.

37:20.784 --> 37:22.799
You nurse a dozen of his brats

37:22.831 --> 37:24.464
and eye the back of his neck

37:24.495 --> 37:26.832
every time you sharpen
your kitchen knives.

37:26.863 --> 37:29.551
Please yourself with that fantasy.

37:29.582 --> 37:31.471
You know nothing of love.

37:31.502 --> 37:32.592
<i>Real</i> love.

37:32.622 --> 37:33.903
Like his and mine.

37:33.934 --> 37:36.623
Yours perhaps. But his?

37:36.655 --> 37:39.184
There, my dear, you're sadly deluded.

37:39.216 --> 37:42.192
And I must admit to playing a
cruel part in that delusion.

37:42.223 --> 37:44.463
What are you saying?

37:44.494 --> 37:47.023
I'm saying that he hates you.

37:47.055 --> 37:49.007
No, that's not true. He told me...

37:49.039 --> 37:51.343
What if I told you it was I
who appeared as John Alden

37:51.375 --> 37:53.903
and forgave you all your
lustful infidelity?

37:53.935 --> 37:55.504
You lie.

37:55.535 --> 37:58.383
His heart could not be
colder towards you.

38:00.336 --> 38:02.800
Even if he has stopped loving me,

38:02.830 --> 38:05.360
he would never betray me.

38:05.392 --> 38:07.247
You sought to destroy my love for him,

38:07.278 --> 38:09.744
but all you have done is
prove that I made no mistake

38:09.775 --> 38:11.919
in whom I chose to love.

38:14.094 --> 38:16.753
Anne: Come, brother. It is time.

38:19.440 --> 38:23.503
Go on. Do what needs to be done.

38:23.535 --> 38:25.551
I have one last thing to dispose of.

38:25.584 --> 38:27.152
You cannot risk being
outside these walls when...

38:27.182 --> 38:28.751
Don't worry.

38:28.784 --> 38:31.728
It will take me but a moment to
dispose of this last detail.

38:48.563 --> 38:50.804
Your life will not have been in vain.

38:52.046 --> 38:55.983
I intend to see improvements
in Knockers Hole.

38:55.985 --> 38:58.833
Once I've broken their will.

38:58.874 --> 39:03.770
If only I hadn't been
born so simple-minded.

39:03.800 --> 39:06.777
I might have known that you
two would find each other.

39:06.810 --> 39:10.329
I might have done so much more.

39:10.361 --> 39:13.082
There, there.

39:13.112 --> 39:15.833
Don't blame yourself.

39:15.865 --> 39:20.121
It's not your lack of intellect
that has doomed you,

39:20.153 --> 39:23.578
but your useless...

39:23.608 --> 39:25.113
heart.

39:25.145 --> 39:28.313
Truth is, you're too
good for this world.

39:28.345 --> 39:31.993
A fault we'll soon rectify.

39:33.529 --> 39:35.354
A simple lick of poison.

39:35.384 --> 39:37.081
No.

39:37.113 --> 39:39.193
A walk in the woods...

39:39.224 --> 39:41.849
and a quick bullet to the heart.

40:01.946 --> 40:03.961
Did you do this?

40:08.792 --> 40:11.738
Isaac! Isaac!

40:17.528 --> 40:19.930
So, how much time is left?

40:24.504 --> 40:25.720
Midnight!

40:25.753 --> 40:27.930
When Black Sunday falls.

40:27.962 --> 40:30.298
Unless you keep pawing at it,
then it's gonna come sooner.

40:30.330 --> 40:32.953
Don't... please. Don't paw at it.

40:32.984 --> 40:34.873
That means we have a quarter of an hour

40:34.904 --> 40:36.569
for you to help me stop this thing.

40:42.232 --> 40:44.889
I told you, I have no idea.

40:44.920 --> 40:46.840
Well, either I put a stop to this thing

40:46.873 --> 40:49.016
or it puts a stop to the both of us.

41:13.401 --> 41:16.313
If you break the wrong
lever we're both done for!

41:16.344 --> 41:19.128
And if I can stop the main spring,

41:19.161 --> 41:20.410
the clock will be stopped

41:20.441 --> 41:22.074
and it won't matter how deadly it is

41:22.105 --> 41:24.090
if midnight never arrives.

41:24.121 --> 41:26.746
Come on. Come on.

41:41.273 --> 41:42.809
But...

41:42.842 --> 41:44.313
that's impossible.

41:44.344 --> 41:45.978
It's the devil's clock.

41:46.008 --> 41:48.249
Anything is possible.

41:50.969 --> 41:52.698
I have never been so happy

41:52.728 --> 41:54.297
to see someone I hate as right now.

41:54.329 --> 41:55.929
How the hell do we stop this thing?

41:55.960 --> 42:00.921
Now, why on earth would
I want to do that?

42:03.673 --> 42:06.169
Anne, stop!

42:06.201 --> 42:08.313
Whatever they've promised
you, it's not worth it.

42:08.344 --> 42:11.354
You need to learn when to give up...

42:11.385 --> 42:13.497
or at least when to shut your mouth.

42:13.529 --> 42:15.929
No. No, if you do this,

42:15.961 --> 42:18.234
then you will hear my voice
long after I'm gone.

42:18.265 --> 42:20.120
To the end of your days and beyond

42:20.152 --> 42:22.457
you will hear my voice
ringing in your ears

42:22.488 --> 42:24.153
and you will know I'm right.

42:24.184 --> 42:26.232
I have no stake in this.

42:26.264 --> 42:28.152
My life and love are over.

42:28.184 --> 42:30.201
I have nothing to gain
and nothing to lose.

42:30.234 --> 42:32.922
And I say, this is <i>not</i> who you are.

42:32.952 --> 42:35.001
You have always been better than this.

42:35.033 --> 42:36.888
Do not let them make you do this.

42:36.921 --> 42:39.353
I do it...

42:39.385 --> 42:42.169
of my own free will.

42:43.833 --> 42:47.000
You would damn generations
to hell on earth

42:47.033 --> 42:49.274
because of your own bitter heart?!

42:55.832 --> 42:58.041
You are absolutely right.

42:58.074 --> 43:00.249
I would.

43:05.146 --> 43:08.250
Happily.

43:08.281 --> 43:11.770
I would turn the earth

43:11.801 --> 43:13.976
into a bitter desert

43:14.009 --> 43:15.897
in the very image of my heart!

43:15.929 --> 43:17.329
No!

43:40.984 --> 43:43.896
I'm home.

43:50.489 --> 43:53.786
And not a moment too soon.

43:55.033 --> 43:58.810
Because in mere minutes...

43:58.841 --> 44:02.042
it will be Sunday.
