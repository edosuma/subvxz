WEBVTT

00:01.395 --> 00:03.538
You could have done me less moody
if you'd made me into a moody.

00:03.678 --> 00:05.222
I'll make you a moody right now.

00:05.666 --> 00:06.767
Get on with your life

00:06.953 --> 00:09.473
and forget about the woman
you didn't want to marry.

00:09.613 --> 00:11.281
- Back to work.
- Yes, sir.

00:11.428 --> 00:13.251
Anything you want
to tell me about there, captain?

00:13.401 --> 00:15.148
Please. I'm a married man.

00:15.323 --> 00:16.653
Hey, baby.

00:17.704 --> 00:20.086
- My name is Hank.
- I know.

00:23.206 --> 00:25.788
This is Mia, Bill's daughter,
and this is Hank.

00:26.482 --> 00:28.368
You two know each other?

00:28.625 --> 00:31.275
- I am 16, you know.
- So I've been told.

00:31.415 --> 00:33.964
- My daughter's an angel.
- You poor bastard.

00:34.104 --> 00:37.905
I have a creative-writing course,
and I need to turn something in today.

00:38.045 --> 00:39.863
You must have
some piece-of-shit short story

00:40.070 --> 00:42.151
you never published
around here somewhere.

00:42.291 --> 00:43.592
- Remember me?
- How could I forget?

00:43.732 --> 00:46.280
I think we took things
to a whole other level.

00:46.541 --> 00:48.776
Can I talk to you for a second?

00:48.916 --> 00:52.529
- That's married guy. Come on.
- I didn't know he was gonna be here.

00:52.669 --> 00:54.542
- Let her go.
- What are you talking about?

00:54.914 --> 00:55.901
Fucker!

00:58.347 --> 00:59.643
I'm glad we came.

01:23.775 --> 01:24.995
I'm back,

01:25.255 --> 01:28.320
and you're Black, which is cool.
I'm a big fan of Black Jesus.

01:28.460 --> 01:31.324
High five. Don't leave me hanging.
There you go.

01:33.924 --> 01:36.595
- Can I help you, my son?
- Hey, <i>padre</i>.

01:36.773 --> 01:39.689
No, I was just trying to check in
with J.Z. up there.

01:41.135 --> 01:42.652
Anything I can help you with?

01:42.849 --> 01:45.432
Sure you don't have a grab-ass
appointment with an Altar Boy?

01:47.437 --> 01:49.517
There's plenty of time for that.

01:53.232 --> 01:54.691
You checking out my package?

01:56.263 --> 01:58.946
You don't want to suck my cock, do you?

01:59.870 --> 02:01.448
Do you want me to suck your cock?

02:02.073 --> 02:03.325
Do you want me

02:03.585 --> 02:06.594
to want you to suck my cock?

02:07.672 --> 02:11.437
- You want to tell me why you're here?
- It's about a girl. She's beautiful.

02:11.577 --> 02:13.585
She's smart and funny,

02:13.845 --> 02:16.713
- up for all kinds of intercourse.
- But she's not Karen.

02:17.231 --> 02:19.758
- I didn't say that.
- Karen doesn't love you, Hank.

02:21.283 --> 02:22.386
She loves me.

02:40.831 --> 02:42.154
With a gay priest!

02:44.328 --> 02:45.643
Fuck me.

02:46.466 --> 02:49.734
Has anyone ever told you
you have a lot of bad dreams?

02:50.550 --> 02:53.254
What's wrong with Black Jesus
and a gay priest

02:53.479 --> 02:56.429
just looking for a little oral
to get him through his night?

02:57.380 --> 02:58.657
L.O.L.

02:59.056 --> 03:00.483
What was that?

03:00.695 --> 03:03.544
What'd you just say just now? L.O.L.?

03:04.662 --> 03:07.367
- "Laugh out loud"?
- Yep.

03:08.140 --> 03:11.413
That's a part of your lexicon?
Really? L.O.L.?

03:12.196 --> 03:14.135
Shouldn't it be part of yours, too?

03:14.276 --> 03:16.627
You are writing
for cyberspace, you know.

03:16.795 --> 03:19.520
And there goes my boner. Wave bye-bye.

03:20.229 --> 03:23.132
- What is your issue with "L.O.L."?
- I don't have an issue,

03:23.272 --> 03:25.469
unless you count the fact
that every time you say it,

03:25.620 --> 03:28.446
you're contributing to the death
of the english language.

03:29.746 --> 03:31.512
So, let me get this straight.

03:31.713 --> 03:34.680
You're gonna let the fact
that I just said "L.O.L."

03:34.988 --> 03:38.718
get in the way of me giving you
the best b.j. of your life?

03:40.377 --> 03:42.424
Not when you put it that way.

03:47.724 --> 03:51.198
Yeah, I'm not the biggest fan
of the term "b.j." Either.

04:37.822 --> 04:40.899
Baby, don't make me beg.
We haven't had sex

04:41.159 --> 04:44.408
since my last period.
You know how fucking horny I get.

04:47.309 --> 04:50.284
You can have the ass if you want.

04:51.547 --> 04:52.703
You can keep it.

04:53.252 --> 04:55.571
Last time we tried anal
during the light of day...

04:55.711 --> 04:57.387
Not pretty, remember?

04:57.744 --> 05:00.169
You used to be all about
the morning sex.

05:00.309 --> 05:03.278
- What's going on with you?
- I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry.

05:03.419 --> 05:06.007
I'm really stressed out right now, okay?

05:06.267 --> 05:08.051
It's work stuff, really.

05:08.306 --> 05:09.521
I know.

05:09.915 --> 05:12.055
- Pretend I'm paralyzed.
- What?

05:15.235 --> 05:17.988
- Come on. This will be fun.
- You need to shoot some glue.

05:18.129 --> 05:20.232
I'll just lay here.
Do what you got to do.

05:20.458 --> 05:22.167
I'll be your vessel.

05:29.124 --> 05:31.378
What the fuck are you doing back there?

05:31.661 --> 05:33.618
What? You don't like that?

05:33.878 --> 05:35.405
No, I just...

05:36.432 --> 05:40.086
You can't just go send probes
into unexplored territory

05:40.226 --> 05:42.783
without any advance warning.
You know what I'm saying?

05:43.010 --> 05:46.047
I was just trying to spice things up
a little bit.

05:46.307 --> 05:48.155
Things haven't been hot enough for you?

05:48.373 --> 05:50.604
It was just a finger up the ass.

05:51.276 --> 05:53.013
I could use the littler one.

05:55.689 --> 05:59.311
I've got to get to work, okay?
I'm gonna be late.

06:02.282 --> 06:03.465
Love you.

06:07.637 --> 06:08.989
Fuck off!

06:14.794 --> 06:16.519
"B" to the "I" to the double "l."

06:16.659 --> 06:18.735
What's up, my nig nog?

06:19.356 --> 06:20.582
I need to talk to you.

06:20.722 --> 06:23.431
Well, you should have called.
I wouldn't have answered,

06:23.571 --> 06:26.496
but you could've left a message,
which I would have quickly erased.

06:27.307 --> 06:29.841
Yeah, this isn't something
I would choose to discuss

06:30.059 --> 06:31.336
over the phone.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.130
This is about Mia.

06:36.992 --> 06:38.892
You're aware
she's in high school, correct?

06:39.532 --> 06:40.786
Really? No.

06:40.926 --> 06:43.396
I mean, I-I was thinking
she was older than that...

06:43.656 --> 06:46.817
College, grad school maybe,
something like that.

06:47.077 --> 06:49.439
Quit fucking around, Hank.
this is serious.

06:49.954 --> 06:51.223
Shit, Bill.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.741
I'm sorry, man. I'm really sorry,

06:55.001 --> 06:57.816
and I... You know, this is just
a fucked-up situation.

06:58.088 --> 07:00.747
And it should have never happened,
but nobody's to blame, really.

07:00.897 --> 07:03.475
I mean, I'm glad, in a way,
that you're here,

07:03.760 --> 07:06.560
you know, so we can get on
the same page, all right, man?

07:07.323 --> 07:08.666
Your turn.

07:10.939 --> 07:12.498
What are you talking about?

07:13.371 --> 07:16.473
I don't know. What are you...
It depends. What are you talking about?

07:16.717 --> 07:19.307
Are you stoned or drunk?

07:19.567 --> 07:22.269
What am I talking about?
What am I talking about?

07:22.529 --> 07:24.955
I don't know half the fucking time
what I'm talking about.

07:25.095 --> 07:26.535
I got to ask you a favor, Hank.

07:27.220 --> 07:30.018
Fuck. Well, a favor.

07:30.246 --> 07:32.279
Okay, this should be entertaining.

07:33.776 --> 07:36.611
I was supposed to be the guest
speaker at Mia's school today,

07:36.876 --> 07:38.228
but I have to go out of town.

07:40.148 --> 07:43.151
And this concerns me
how exactly, Willamina?

07:43.291 --> 07:46.917
Well, I was hoping that you might
consider stepping in for me.

07:47.434 --> 07:49.809
It's a creative-writing class, and...

07:50.223 --> 07:51.972
I was gonna talk about publishing.

07:52.112 --> 07:54.583
You can talk about writing
or not writing

07:54.723 --> 07:56.502
or whatever works.

07:58.981 --> 08:01.000
And what's in it for me?

08:01.573 --> 08:02.624
What do you want?

08:04.833 --> 08:06.396
Call off the wedding.

08:07.005 --> 08:08.347
Anything else?

08:11.251 --> 08:13.156
That's a nice jacket.

08:27.092 --> 08:28.942
You a smoker? There you go.

08:31.850 --> 08:33.381
All right, so, at the end of day,

08:33.640 --> 08:37.294
if you can do anything else...
telemarketing,

08:37.562 --> 08:40.725
pharmaceutical sales,
or ditch digging,

08:40.982 --> 08:44.472
major league umpire... I would
suggest that you do that,

08:44.736 --> 08:46.256
because being a writer blows.

08:46.434 --> 08:49.386
It's like having homework every day
for the rest of your life.

08:50.408 --> 08:51.857
Any more questions?

08:52.608 --> 08:54.045
Yikes. Yeah?

08:54.818 --> 08:56.571
- Are you single?
- Of course I am.

08:56.831 --> 08:58.073
Who would have me?

08:58.333 --> 08:59.407
I would.

09:00.018 --> 09:03.154
Okay, girls, let's thank Hank
for coming in on such short notice.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.999
Cigarette break, everybody. All right.

09:13.532 --> 09:18.005
- Dude, you're a fucking rock star.
- Please. It's an all-girls school.

09:18.145 --> 09:21.352
Anything with a half a cock and one ball
is gonna get a rise out of these kids.

09:21.511 --> 09:24.247
Tell me about it.
Best job I've ever had.

09:25.184 --> 09:27.757
- They're very young.
- Oh, say that again...

09:28.236 --> 09:29.538
Slower this time.

09:29.678 --> 09:31.366
My... My fleshy T.A.
didn't hear you.

09:31.506 --> 09:33.431
Stop. Laugh it up, funny man,

09:33.701 --> 09:36.610
but you could go to jail
for that shit.

09:36.750 --> 09:39.258
You're acting like it's
a fucking Mommy & Me class.

09:39.464 --> 09:42.158
These girls are right
on the cusp of their womaninity.

09:42.418 --> 09:44.185
What else is out there for guys like us?

09:44.373 --> 09:46.862
- Guys like us?
- I wrote a novel...

09:47.642 --> 09:49.730
- Three of them, actually.
- Oh, yeah?

09:50.051 --> 09:52.564
They never came out of the drawer,
but I fucking wrote them.

09:52.756 --> 09:54.482
I wrote the shit out of them.

09:54.622 --> 09:55.759
So, what do I do?

09:55.899 --> 09:58.378
Write screenplays like
the rest of the fucking herd?

09:58.541 --> 10:02.663
Or do I fight the good fight and promote
an appreciation of great writing?

10:02.803 --> 10:05.123
And just fuck the ones
who are just bored

10:05.377 --> 10:07.429
and stupid
enough to spread 'em for you?

10:07.740 --> 10:09.185
Speaking of which, Mia

10:09.445 --> 10:11.638
- is a seriously good writer.
- Yeah?

10:11.948 --> 10:14.545
She's written a couple good
short stories, but nothing since.

10:14.701 --> 10:15.813
But they're good.

10:16.943 --> 10:18.023
Who knows?

10:18.408 --> 10:21.014
Maybe I'm grading on a curve
'cause she gives me wood.

10:22.465 --> 10:24.329
Not so much
with the character development.

10:24.469 --> 10:27.084
The prose was a little stiff.
She was trying too hard, really.

10:27.545 --> 10:28.586
Right.

10:29.007 --> 10:30.385
Van fuckin' Halen.

10:31.986 --> 10:33.494
Is there another motive ingress?

10:48.772 --> 10:50.910
- Busted.
- Oh, god, you don't understand.

10:51.050 --> 10:52.610
I could've been there for hours.

10:52.750 --> 10:53.906
Poor Hank Moody.

10:54.084 --> 10:56.179
What's the deal with you
and Mr. Chipwich?

10:56.328 --> 10:58.774
- Meaning what exactly?
- You know what I mean.

10:58.914 --> 11:00.811
- Does he have carnal knowledge?
- Yeah, that.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.024
Not yet.

11:02.459 --> 11:03.567
Be careful.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.501
Says the much-older man
who did sleep with me.

11:06.641 --> 11:08.651
- It was an accident.
- Right, there you were,

11:08.815 --> 11:10.473
minding your own business,
walking down

11:10.613 --> 11:12.843
Abbot Kinney
when your dick on me. Oopsie.

11:13.090 --> 11:16.047
What is this? Open-mike night?
Look, just be careful of him

11:16.553 --> 11:17.666
and those of his ilk.

11:17.806 --> 11:19.450
Hank moody,
as I live and breathe,

11:19.590 --> 11:21.803
- are you looking out for me?
- Why wouldn't I?

11:22.244 --> 11:25.462
Aside from the fact that you're mad
as a hatter, you're a good kid.

11:27.217 --> 11:29.943
Well, seeing as I can't seem
to get you back in the sack,

11:30.083 --> 11:31.829
I guess I'll just
have to settle for him.

11:31.969 --> 11:33.975
I'm sure he won't play as hard to get.

11:34.115 --> 11:35.407
Out of the car.

11:39.640 --> 11:41.124
Have a nice day at school, dear.

11:41.264 --> 11:42.626
Bye, Hankarella.

11:47.261 --> 11:48.423
How do I look?

11:48.768 --> 11:50.665
Sweetie, you look great.
But you know what?

11:50.805 --> 11:53.208
It's a guitar lesson.
It's not a fashion show.

11:53.348 --> 11:56.556
Mother, rock, fashion...
It's all one world.

11:56.698 --> 11:58.503
Okay, Avril.

11:58.763 --> 12:00.241
- He is cute.
- He is?

12:00.754 --> 12:02.782
- I hadn't noticed.
- I look like a geek.

12:03.153 --> 12:04.199
No, you don't.

12:04.963 --> 12:06.787
It's okay. I'll get it.

12:10.701 --> 12:11.729
Ladies.

12:12.330 --> 12:13.332
Your shirt.

12:13.799 --> 12:16.163
What?
You're not a fan, are you?

12:16.572 --> 12:17.971
That would make me so sad.

12:18.408 --> 12:20.994
- I think it's cool.
- Well, it's just, you know...

12:21.431 --> 12:22.473
- Becca.
- Yeah.

12:22.613 --> 12:24.543
Right. Sorry about that.

12:24.683 --> 12:26.334
- I wasn't thinking.
- It's okay.

12:26.474 --> 12:27.952
She's my youngest student

12:28.391 --> 12:31.243
- and my most promising.
- Oh, she is? Well, that's great.

12:31.531 --> 12:34.804
I probably have some smelly, old
thing in my car somewhere.

12:35.230 --> 12:37.235
Or you could just turn it
inside out.

12:37.380 --> 12:39.188
You know, you could use
the bathroom on...

12:40.455 --> 12:41.462
Or not.

12:46.677 --> 12:48.610
Hey... Dave.

12:48.980 --> 12:50.399
Hey, sweetie.

12:50.993 --> 12:52.546
- Better?
- Much.

12:52.686 --> 12:54.497
I liked it better off,
but that's just me.

12:55.841 --> 12:57.318
- How you doing?
- Good.

12:57.587 --> 12:58.925
You been practicing?

13:09.149 --> 13:10.598
I'm here with Hank Moody,

13:10.869 --> 13:13.816
author of celebrated underground novels

13:13.956 --> 13:15.300
like <i>South of Heaven,</i>

13:15.590 --> 13:18.145
<i>Seasons in the Abyss,</i>
and most famously,

13:18.321 --> 13:20.844
<i>God Hates Us All.</i>
How are you, Hank?

13:20.984 --> 13:23.712
I'm a little under the weather,
but it's good to be here. Thanks.

13:23.852 --> 13:27.456
Some folks have compared
the wait for your next novel

13:27.596 --> 13:30.915
to the decade-plus wait
for the new <i>Guns N' Roses</i> album.

13:31.343 --> 13:33.587
Which one do you think will see
the light of day first?

13:33.727 --> 13:36.323
Well, I certainly hope that I beat
Guns N' Roses to the punch,

13:36.463 --> 13:38.709
because I want to get
on Oprah's book club.

13:39.040 --> 13:40.685
I want that sticker
from the book club.

13:40.825 --> 13:43.269
I want to get on that show,
and I want to ask her...

13:44.376 --> 13:46.698
About that scene in <i>Beloved</i>
where she squats and pees.

13:46.848 --> 13:48.600
How many takes did she do?
Was she method?

13:48.740 --> 13:51.002
In all seriousness,
your blog for <i>Hell-A Magazine</i>

13:51.142 --> 13:53.287
is prompting a lot of
underground water-cooler talk.

13:53.428 --> 13:54.719
- It's great.
- Thank you,

13:55.626 --> 13:58.340
but it's really... It's more like
pissing out of my ass

13:58.480 --> 14:00.509
than anything else.
You know, it's just...

14:00.729 --> 14:04.017
things bother me, and I vent,
I write it down.

14:04.430 --> 14:05.928
What's your latest obsession?

14:06.068 --> 14:08.647
Just the fact that people seem
to be getting dumber and dumber.

14:08.806 --> 14:11.081
I mean, we have all this amazing
technology, and yet...

14:11.250 --> 14:13.846
computers have turned into basically
four-figure wank machines.

14:14.198 --> 14:16.949
The internet was supposed to
set us free, democratize us, but...

14:17.089 --> 14:20.680
But all it's really given us is
Howard Dean's aborted candidacy and...

14:20.845 --> 14:22.942
24-hour day acces to kiddy porn.

14:23.278 --> 14:26.317
People... They don't write anymore.
They blog.

14:26.457 --> 14:30.050
Instead of talking, they text...
No punctuation, no grammar, L.O.L. this

14:30.331 --> 14:32.573
and l.M.F.A.O. that.
It just seems to me

14:32.833 --> 14:35.342
that it's just a bunch of stupid
people pseudo-communicating

14:35.482 --> 14:37.749
with a bunch of other stupid people
in a protolanguage

14:37.889 --> 14:40.831
that resembles more what cavemen
used to speak than the king's English.

14:40.982 --> 14:44.811
Yet, you're part of the problem.
You're blogging with the best of them.

14:44.951 --> 14:46.967
Hence my self-loathing,
you know.

14:47.900 --> 14:49.671
Bar chords are tought, I know.

14:49.811 --> 14:51.247
But once you master them,

14:51.391 --> 14:54.207
all the secrets of the rock 'n' roll
universe will be revealed...

14:54.355 --> 14:55.355
Trust me.

14:58.442 --> 15:01.082
Hold on a second.
I have something for you.

15:01.222 --> 15:02.947
- Wait right here, OK?
- You got it.

15:05.576 --> 15:06.777
Hey, how'd it go?

15:08.244 --> 15:09.671
I'm sure you already know this,

15:09.811 --> 15:11.690
but you have
a really sweet kid there.

15:11.830 --> 15:13.667
You know, you're preaching to the choir.

15:13.807 --> 15:15.305
But thanks. it never gets old.

15:15.621 --> 15:18.369
She's really into it, too,
which is really cool to see.

15:19.096 --> 15:20.523
Makes my job a pleasure.

15:20.788 --> 15:22.866
Well, she comes by it honestly.

15:23.006 --> 15:25.689
I mean, her dad is really into music...

15:26.397 --> 15:30.128
- and I was in a band once.
- I'd love to hear the stories sometime.

15:33.272 --> 15:34.351
Excuse me.

15:37.402 --> 15:38.472
Hello?

15:38.907 --> 15:40.761
Hey, sweetie. How are you?

15:42.126 --> 15:43.554
How was the flight?

15:44.954 --> 15:46.747
And the hotel... is it okay?

15:47.585 --> 15:49.808
Hey, yeah, hold on one second.

15:49.948 --> 15:50.948
Where'd he go?

15:51.093 --> 15:53.564
Breathe, honey. It's okay.
he's just outside.

15:54.363 --> 15:55.306
I got to go.

15:55.446 --> 15:57.599
Um, Becca's just finishing
her guitar lesson.

15:57.918 --> 15:59.573
What the music that you love?

15:59.713 --> 16:02.154
I am a sucker for <i>Radiohead</i>.

16:02.492 --> 16:04.153
Got any exciting plans, this week-end?

16:05.635 --> 16:08.503
- Got to rehearse with the band.
- What do you guys sound like?

16:08.763 --> 16:10.280
It's like <i>Radiohead</i>.

16:10.681 --> 16:12.173
We got a killer bassist.

16:12.396 --> 16:13.528
- Right.
- Yeah.

16:13.668 --> 16:15.501
- All those things.
- All those things.

16:16.840 --> 16:17.939
What's this?

16:18.248 --> 16:20.854
I made it for you...
some songs I like.

16:21.065 --> 16:22.796
I thought
you might like them, too.

16:24.011 --> 16:25.903
A mix tape... cd.

16:27.861 --> 16:29.842
No one's made me one of these
in a long time.

16:30.685 --> 16:33.201
Thank you, sweetie.
I will treasure it always.

16:34.043 --> 16:35.799
Same time next week?

16:45.885 --> 16:47.574
Look, I don't want
to take sides here,

16:47.714 --> 16:51.389
but I want to say, for the record,
categorically, never...

16:51.677 --> 16:54.542
never stick a finger up
a grown man's ass without warning.

16:54.682 --> 16:55.803
Don't do it.

16:56.216 --> 16:57.832
- Hi.
- Thank you.

16:58.809 --> 16:59.823
Write that down.

17:00.027 --> 17:01.998
You know what?
I've been with other guys.

17:02.274 --> 17:05.978
And sometimes a little ass play is not
only welcome, but it's appreciated.

17:06.117 --> 17:08.710
Yes, I understand, but you got to be
gentle with the brown eye.

17:08.851 --> 17:10.382
Mr. Brown eye's
a sensitive man.

17:10.657 --> 17:12.127
Hey, sorry I'm late.

17:13.217 --> 17:15.291
Found a redhead
wandering the parking lot.

17:16.984 --> 17:19.877
- Brought her in for you.
- Sorry I'm late. stuck in traffic.

17:20.361 --> 17:22.760
Listening to the radio...
Very entertaining.

17:23.012 --> 17:24.502
- L.O.L.
- Yes.

17:26.614 --> 17:29.518
So, have you been telling her what
an airhead your new girlfriend is?

17:30.979 --> 17:33.130
No, I was just about to.

17:34.426 --> 17:35.900
I heard the interview, Hank.

17:36.309 --> 17:39.356
Nothing like being the object of scorn
and derision on public radio.

17:40.646 --> 17:42.180
Well, that's the point, right?

17:42.440 --> 17:45.237
Because it's public radio.
Who's listening? So...

17:46.755 --> 17:48.895
So, is this why
his relationships don't last?

17:49.196 --> 17:52.313
Because the girls can't live up to
some ridiculous fucking gold standard?

17:53.027 --> 17:55.276
What did you do today?
did you get your hair done?

17:55.590 --> 17:57.901
If you spent less time focusing
on other people's flaws,

17:58.065 --> 18:00.203
you'd notice you've got
some of your own.

18:00.343 --> 18:02.185
Speaking of flaws,
Dodger game, Friday night?

18:02.325 --> 18:05.180
- I didn't say that I didn't.
- Great. You want to hear some?

18:05.563 --> 18:08.157
- It seems like you want to tell me.
- Yeah, I do.

18:08.527 --> 18:10.479
You drink too much, write too little,

18:10.619 --> 18:12.978
and the only exercise you get
is in the bedroom.

18:13.118 --> 18:15.779
You love women, but you hate
yourself, so any woman

18:15.919 --> 18:18.769
who actually really does like you
is ultimately deemed a fool.

18:20.748 --> 18:23.277
And seeing as that woman
could pretty much be anyone,

18:24.711 --> 18:26.215
this one is saying goodbye.

18:26.899 --> 18:30.534
Hold on just one second. I seem to
have hurt you, and I apologize for that.

18:31.053 --> 18:33.117
But that's not what this is about.

18:33.968 --> 18:36.265
This is about something else.
Tell me what it's about.

18:39.321 --> 18:40.469
"B.R.B.", Hank.

18:43.298 --> 18:46.045
I will go and make sure she
doesn't kill herself this time.

18:46.305 --> 18:49.816
And by the way, getting all aggro
about a little stinky pinky

18:49.966 --> 18:52.685
is definitely a symptom
of a much bigger problem.

18:54.853 --> 18:55.864
Oh, jeez.

19:00.577 --> 19:02.764
I don't know what she's talking about.

19:05.748 --> 19:06.748
Bitches.

19:17.667 --> 19:18.667
Intruder.

19:20.578 --> 19:23.467
- What are you doing here?
- You just spooked myself.

19:24.464 --> 19:26.773
That was very cool, what you did today,

19:27.320 --> 19:29.922
- talking at Mia's school.
- Oh, yeah, can we

19:30.120 --> 19:32.799
please agree right now
to never send Becca there?

19:34.238 --> 19:35.910
- How's my girl?
- I'm good.

19:36.050 --> 19:38.680
I've got a lot of work on, but, yeah...

19:38.820 --> 19:41.663
I was talking about Becca,
but I like where your head's at.

19:42.018 --> 19:44.990
That's embarrassing. I just slipped
into a past life for a second.

19:45.130 --> 19:46.702
I still get my mail there.

19:48.027 --> 19:49.362
I love your feet.

19:50.228 --> 19:52.603
She's got a crush on her guitar teacher.

19:52.743 --> 19:53.743
That's great.

19:53.885 --> 19:57.034
At least it's not the captain
of the fucking football team.

19:57.212 --> 19:58.418
Is he crush worthy?

19:58.558 --> 20:00.745
Does he bring out your inner rocker slut?

20:01.332 --> 20:03.628
You know, he is pretty fucking hot,
yeah.

20:04.126 --> 20:06.614
- Should I be worried?
- Isn't that Bill's problem?

20:06.955 --> 20:09.018
Yeah, I don't know
if Bill worries enough.

20:09.428 --> 20:10.440
Whatever.

20:11.028 --> 20:12.476
Hey, you think I might...

20:13.201 --> 20:15.675
Take Becca out for some ice cream
or something?

20:17.595 --> 20:20.012
You could, but, you know,
you just missed her.

20:20.152 --> 20:22.122
- She's snoozing. Sorry.
- Shit.

20:26.471 --> 20:29.225
- Can I ask you something?
- If you must.

20:31.098 --> 20:33.788
In this... past life of ours,

20:35.279 --> 20:38.388
was I mean to you? Did I ever...

20:40.780 --> 20:42.470
Did I make you feel stupid?

20:43.761 --> 20:45.296
You weren't mean, no.

20:47.055 --> 20:49.662
But you can be pretty hard
on people, Hank.

20:51.703 --> 20:53.554
I wish it was different.

20:54.726 --> 20:55.942
And so do I.

20:57.248 --> 20:58.345
But it's not.

21:01.061 --> 21:03.288
How is that girl
from the fund-raiser?

21:03.928 --> 21:05.765
She is pissed at me.

21:07.074 --> 21:08.518
- She's not.
- Yeah.

21:10.118 --> 21:11.409
She'll get over it.

21:16.218 --> 21:17.545
Is that Bill's jacket?

21:19.200 --> 21:22.677
That's a long story. I got to go.
Good night, foot.

22:20.048 --> 22:24.115
You know, it's not fair to say "B.R.B"
and then never actually B.R.B.?

22:25.405 --> 22:27.005
But apology accepted.

22:27.496 --> 22:28.514
Come here.

22:29.387 --> 22:31.744
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

22:32.383 --> 22:34.201
I needed my black skirt.

22:34.485 --> 22:36.779
That's understandable.
It's probably hard

22:36.919 --> 22:39.789
to be taken seriously in a courtroom
when you're bottomless.

22:40.263 --> 22:43.046
Though <i>I</i> would take you seriously.

22:44.609 --> 22:47.743
I... also wanted to give you this.

22:48.958 --> 22:50.031
Shit.

22:51.285 --> 22:53.206
So, you're gonna blow this whole thing

22:53.443 --> 22:55.874
my issues with the language
of cyberspace?

22:56.112 --> 22:58.331
What's this whole thing
you're talking about?

22:58.502 --> 23:01.175
We drink, we fuck, we watch
old movies in your apartment.

23:01.466 --> 23:02.920
Sounds fucking awesome.

23:04.599 --> 23:07.139
You're just pissed
'cause I beat you to the punch.

23:07.324 --> 23:09.153
You were looking for an excuse to bail.

23:09.324 --> 23:10.615
So says you.

23:10.806 --> 23:13.596
- But I guess we'll never find out.
- I guess not.

23:17.887 --> 23:19.229
He left his wife.

23:26.388 --> 23:28.388
That's what this was about. Fuck.

23:28.842 --> 23:30.533
In a way, I have you to thank.

23:31.224 --> 23:33.805
- You really did rattle his cage.
- Yeah.

23:34.314 --> 23:36.151
Glad to be of service, Milady.

23:38.787 --> 23:39.804
I just...

23:40.714 --> 23:42.496
I just feel so used.

23:42.860 --> 23:45.441
Shut up, we were using each other.

23:47.529 --> 23:50.147
I love how you're taking
the moral high ground here.

23:50.311 --> 23:52.416
I'm sure that if I canvassed
the West Side,

23:52.556 --> 23:55.536
I'd find more than a few girls
who feel used and abused by you.

23:56.079 --> 23:59.447
You seem to think that I have
this narrow perception of you?

23:59.676 --> 24:02.040
But it's you with the narrow
perception of me.

24:02.185 --> 24:04.167
I love women.
I have all their albums.

24:04.585 --> 24:05.603
Shit!

24:06.439 --> 24:10.630
I think I'd just feel better about it
if I didn't think you were re-entering

24:10.775 --> 24:12.870
this hopelessly dysfunctional
relationship

24:13.010 --> 24:15.192
with an aggressively mediocre white guy.

24:15.392 --> 24:17.156
I've spent time with the man.

24:17.665 --> 24:18.978
Time stood still.

24:20.216 --> 24:23.409
This from someone who's still hopelessly
in love with his ex... whatever.

24:23.689 --> 24:25.470
Well, at least she's cool.

24:26.960 --> 24:28.608
Okay, what are you... 4?

24:30.458 --> 24:32.994
Perhaps... I don't know.

24:34.650 --> 24:36.141
We just missed it, Hank.

24:36.995 --> 24:39.857
In another lifetime, we would
have been a scorching couple.

24:41.086 --> 24:42.371
But in this one, we...

24:42.680 --> 24:44.369
Missed it. Missed it.

24:46.187 --> 24:47.187
All right.

24:48.842 --> 24:50.806
Well, congratulations.

24:51.197 --> 24:53.361
Best of luck
in all your future endeavors.

24:53.501 --> 24:57.245
And don't forget all the times I brought
you to fruition. 33, to be exact.

24:58.976 --> 25:02.187
And when married guy
goes back to his wife,

25:02.446 --> 25:06.573
which he will,
I hope that you come try to find me.

25:07.371 --> 25:09.773
I hope that you know where to look.

25:10.891 --> 25:14.238
Face down in a puddle of your own sick?
Still not writing?

25:15.507 --> 25:16.507
L.O.L.

25:17.161 --> 25:18.652
L.O. fucking L.

25:20.105 --> 25:22.178
- Bye.
- Bye.

26:01.356 --> 26:02.613
You're quiet.

26:03.483 --> 26:05.683
- I like quiet.
- Yeah, me too.

26:07.374 --> 26:09.047
As long as you're okay.

26:10.631 --> 26:11.867
My heart hurts.

26:13.085 --> 26:14.849
God, baby. Mine, too.

26:15.953 --> 26:17.353
Is it boy trouble?

26:17.571 --> 26:19.880
Me too. Well, girl trouble.

26:22.352 --> 26:24.080
You want to talk about it?

26:25.851 --> 26:28.233
I just want to know
when it stops hurting.

26:29.998 --> 26:31.093
Here's the deal,

26:31.233 --> 26:34.378
and you won't wanna hear it, it's gonna
sound like piss-poor parenting,

26:34.524 --> 26:36.351
but if you're lucky, never.

26:39.255 --> 26:41.675
<i>Oh, what could ail thee,
knight at arms, alone</i>

26:41.857 --> 26:43.221
<i>and palely loitering?</i>

26:43.402 --> 26:46.972
<i>The sedge has withered from the lake,
and no birds sing.</i>

26:48.045 --> 26:50.191
Keats, <i>La belle dame sans merci</i> ?

26:50.991 --> 26:53.045
Is that the best you can do, dad?

26:53.310 --> 26:55.456
How about something from this century?

26:55.638 --> 26:58.674
How about... You got Dylan's
<i>Blood on the tracks</i> ?

26:58.865 --> 27:01.390
You ever listen to that?
Classic heartbreak album.

27:01.535 --> 27:03.336
I can gift it to you on your Ipod.

27:04.015 --> 27:06.393
<i>- If you see her, say hello.</i>
- Dad...

27:06.626 --> 27:09.441
<i>- She might be in Tangier.</i>
- Dad...

27:09.874 --> 27:12.688
<i>She left here last early spring.</i>

27:12.953 --> 27:16.892
<i>Is living there, I hear.</i>
