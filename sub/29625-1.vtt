WEBVTT

00:17.084 --> 00:18.484
I felt like...

00:20.421 --> 00:22.054
like you were...

00:22.056 --> 00:25.124
you wanted to act like
nothing happened and

00:26.660 --> 00:28.260
everything was fine

00:28.262 --> 00:30.329
and we had to pretend

00:30.331 --> 00:33.599
we could get our life back.

00:36.737 --> 00:38.804
But, actually, I...

00:38.806 --> 00:42.441
I really suffered
from what happened and,

00:42.443 --> 00:48.047
and I think we shouldn't
pretend that it's OK and...

00:54.789 --> 00:56.588
and it hurts.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.325
And I...

01:43.838 --> 01:47.206
It's not
like I want to be like this.

01:47.208 --> 01:48.841
I don't want to be empty.

01:50.744 --> 01:52.578
That's the problem though.

01:52.580 --> 01:56.415
I was on full and
wanted to be empty

01:56.417 --> 01:59.151
and now I'm empty
and I want to be full.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.372
Hey.

02:20.374 --> 02:21.907
I have a bunch of
meetings today

02:21.909 --> 02:24.276
so I won't be able
to make our lunch

02:24.278 --> 02:25.911
but I will make a
reservation for tonight

02:25.913 --> 02:28.747
and have Lucy
send you the details.

02:28.749 --> 02:29.781
OK?

02:29.783 --> 02:31.216
Love you.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.589
It's easier for you.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.758
You laugh at the same things,

02:39.760 --> 02:41.894
play racquetball
with your friends.

02:43.430 --> 02:46.798
You have a manageable,
normal sadness.

02:48.369 --> 02:50.836
I don't know how to
forgive you for that.

02:55.276 --> 02:57.409
Hey, Lucy, could you
please call the restaurant

02:57.411 --> 03:00.946
and change the reservation
for four for tonight?

03:02.716 --> 03:04.216
Great, thanks.

03:07.755 --> 03:11.890
I never
liked making long-term plans.

03:11.892 --> 03:14.393
It felt like looking
down at a road

03:14.395 --> 03:17.196
and knowing what's at the end.

03:17.198 --> 03:21.233
I used to be able to see
the end of the road clearly.

03:22.436 --> 03:25.370
Did my body simply
reject that plan?

04:02.810 --> 04:04.843
Is there anything
else I can do for you?

04:04.845 --> 04:08.647
Yes. Please, could you call
down to the front desk

04:08.649 --> 04:11.850
and let them know that my
friend, Greg, is coming.

04:11.852 --> 04:12.918
Just send them up.

04:13.988 --> 04:16.021
Oh, never mind.

04:16.023 --> 04:18.390
Hi. I'm Greg.

04:18.392 --> 04:19.891
Hi, Greg, I'm Lucy.

04:19.892 --> 04:20.892
Lucy.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.427
Very nice to meet you.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.329
Thank you, Lucy.

04:33.907 --> 04:36.275
Has Marin seen her?

04:36.277 --> 04:37.776
Yep.

04:37.778 --> 04:38.944
Goodness.

04:39.913 --> 04:40.912
I mean, the legs?

04:40.914 --> 04:42.914
Everything about her.

04:42.916 --> 04:45.751
Where'd you find her, on Eros?

04:45.753 --> 04:47.619
I mean, seriously, how do you
get any amount of work done

04:47.621 --> 04:49.488
with that sitting 20
feet from your desk?

04:49.490 --> 04:51.923
If Emily knew I had an
assistant that looked like that,

04:51.925 --> 04:53.925
she'd kill me.

04:53.927 --> 04:55.327
Is she single?

04:55.329 --> 04:56.928
Why do you care, you're married.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.497
Yeah.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.314
Ah!

05:15.316 --> 05:16.982
So glad to see you.

05:18.485 --> 05:19.818
I have to finish
pulling a couple looks.

05:19.820 --> 05:20.886
You can help me.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.056
That's pretty.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.659
Yes.

05:30.631 --> 05:31.697
So sexy.

05:33.567 --> 05:36.935
God, I wanna come back
as her in my next life.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.470
What legs.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.872
Jesus, so beautiful.

05:41.809 --> 05:43.408
Oh, one second.

05:48.449 --> 05:51.850
Hey, do you mind if
I jump in real quick?

05:51.852 --> 05:53.051
OK, looks fantastic.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.486
Just want to...

05:58.926 --> 06:00.425
Thank you.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.564
You wanna try one on?

06:05.566 --> 06:06.665
They look so real.

06:06.667 --> 06:09.134
You'd look so good in that one.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.470
Hey, do you have plans tonight?

06:11.472 --> 06:13.505
I'm here all day but I'm
hanging out with Sasha

06:13.507 --> 06:14.840
and a few of her friends
at a bar downtown.

06:14.842 --> 06:15.907
Come with.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.576
No, I have dinner with Mark.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.478
But any other night, I'm OK.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.814
Tomorrow, it's
Francesca's birthday.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.449
I know that you've
heard me talk about her

06:24.451 --> 06:27.953
and she's definitely
heard me talk about you.

06:27.955 --> 06:30.021
- Yeah, sure.
- Excellent.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.391
Ugh, I need a real night out.

06:32.393 --> 06:33.625
Come on, you have
real nights out

06:33.627 --> 06:35.427
like every other
night of the weak.

06:35.429 --> 06:36.661
Oh, my God.

06:36.663 --> 06:38.163
Are you ready to laugh?

06:38.165 --> 06:39.564
Uh-huh.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.467
So, you remember
that erotica book

06:42.469 --> 06:44.469
I wanted you to read
a few years ago?

06:44.471 --> 06:45.971
You know,

06:45.973 --> 06:47.005
my brain.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.174
"The Story of the Eye."

06:49.176 --> 06:50.876
You're gonna die.

06:50.878 --> 06:53.779
So last night I go for
drinks with this guy that

06:53.781 --> 06:56.114
Daniella wanted to set
me up with a while back.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.449
He's cute, whatever.

06:57.451 --> 06:58.784
He can't keep up.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.685
So we end up at his place

07:00.687 --> 07:05.090
and he's got these cat drawings
hanging up in his hallway.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.526
So I ask him about them

07:07.528 --> 07:10.862
and, of course, I mention
"The Story of the Eye,"

07:10.864 --> 07:14.533
and he just looks at me,
gets up and he leaves.

07:14.535 --> 07:16.501
Comes back two seconds later

07:16.503 --> 07:18.970
and he's got this
saucepan of milk.

07:18.972 --> 07:23.074
He places it on the floor and
tells me to get undressed.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.445
You know me, I'll do
anything for a good story.

07:26.447 --> 07:28.447
So I'm like, "Well, OK."

07:28.449 --> 07:31.016
So I take off all my
clothes and he goes,

07:31.018 --> 07:35.520
"Be a good little kitty cat
and dip that pussy in the milk

07:35.522 --> 07:38.857
and crawl towards me
so I can lick it off."

07:38.859 --> 07:40.459
No.

07:40.461 --> 07:42.093
"And don't forget to purr."

07:44.097 --> 07:45.664
Oh my God.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.799
The best part,
he has to use almond milk

07:47.801 --> 07:50.168
because he lactose intolerant.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.704
Jesus Christ,
I'm completely traumatized.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.739
I'm ready to go back to women.

07:54.741 --> 07:57.142
Ugh.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.110
Aw. I thought you would
think that was funny.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.479
I do.

08:00.481 --> 08:01.480
I did.

08:01.482 --> 08:02.614
I am sorry, I'm...

08:02.616 --> 08:05.951
You need a good night out, girl.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.519
OK.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.054
I'm gonna leave you,
this is beautiful.

08:09.056 --> 08:10.689
- Thank you.
- Congrats.

08:10.691 --> 08:11.857
And so, tomorrow?

08:11.859 --> 08:12.924
Mm-hmm.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.960
- See you soon.
- Bye.

08:17.564 --> 08:19.865
Maybe if I pretended I'm happy

08:19.867 --> 08:21.867
that would convince
you that I'm OK

08:21.869 --> 08:25.070
and you'd stop asking
me if I feel better.

08:25.072 --> 08:29.908
But constantly asking me
is making me feel worse.

an order for delivery?

09:36.710 --> 09:37.976
Yeah, Marin.

10:36.370 --> 10:37.769
Yeah!

10:48.649 --> 10:50.949
Thank you.
I don't need change.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.720
I don't know what to do, man.

10:55.722 --> 10:57.856
She just doesn't want
to talk about it.

10:57.858 --> 11:00.792
You guys still
spending time together?

11:00.794 --> 11:02.861
Yeah, we're having
dinner tonight

11:02.863 --> 11:06.965
but I guarantee you
I will be going home alone.

11:06.967 --> 11:10.335
I can't touch her
without her pulling away.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.836
What happened to Emily,

11:11.838 --> 11:13.238
she acted like
everything was fine

11:13.240 --> 11:15.807
then had a meltdown
three weeks later.

11:15.809 --> 11:18.309
We used to be able to
talk about anything.

11:18.311 --> 11:20.311
Now everything I say is wrong.

11:20.313 --> 11:21.913
Just keep giving her space.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.349
She sees a therapist,
talks to Isabel.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.418
I'm sure she'll be OK...

11:26.420 --> 11:27.919
eventually.

11:30.957 --> 11:33.358
A painter will layer a canvas,

11:33.360 --> 11:34.993
paint on paint,

11:34.995 --> 11:37.429
until she finds the
texture she was wants,

11:37.431 --> 11:41.366
the shape and
desired elimination.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.368
Is that what I'm doing?

11:43.370 --> 11:45.870
Am I painting the layers

11:45.872 --> 11:48.173
or am I trying to
strip them off?

12:27.380 --> 12:28.947
Shit.

12:41.027 --> 12:42.794
Can we have
some more standup?

12:42.796 --> 12:44.395
No, I told him...

12:57.344 --> 12:58.843
I can't tell if I'm dreaming

12:58.845 --> 13:00.278
and everyone is awake,

13:00.280 --> 13:03.414
or if am I awake and
they're all dreaming.

13:04.918 --> 13:07.018
Sometimes I just
want to scream.

13:08.188 --> 13:10.054
If I did, would you hear me?

13:10.056 --> 13:13.057
Is my silence
comforting to you?

13:19.332 --> 13:21.432
This thing
is perfect, right?

13:21.434 --> 13:23.434
It can run with you,

13:23.436 --> 13:25.470
it can hunt,

13:25.472 --> 13:26.504
if you did a lot of hunting.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.006
Maybe.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.407
But, like,
it can be a watchdog.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.176
Whatever you want,
the thing is perfect.

13:31.178 --> 13:33.912
But we all know that Jasmine
is not gonna be happy

13:33.914 --> 13:36.948
with just any Australian
Labradoodle, right?

13:36.950 --> 13:40.585
It has to be a chocolate...

13:40.587 --> 13:43.321
Mini Australian
Labradoodle, right?

13:43.323 --> 13:46.457
From this one breeder
in South Carolina.

14:02.576 --> 14:04.475
Hey.

14:04.477 --> 14:06.978
I'm so, so sorry.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.914
When Ben and I went
through this two years ago,

14:09.916 --> 14:11.282
it was heartbreaking.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.017
I just couldn't
even get out of bed,

14:13.019 --> 14:16.020
so I totally know where
you're coming from.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.189
But it helps to go out
and be out with friends

14:18.191 --> 14:19.524
like you are now, really.

14:19.526 --> 14:22.460
So don't sweat it,
you'll be fine.

14:23.330 --> 14:24.896
If you ever need to talk.

14:27.901 --> 14:29.500
Jasmine's your friend.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.069
So what she had a miscarriage.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.438
So does that make
her a therapist?

14:33.440 --> 14:36.975
Does that make her
my therapist?

14:36.977 --> 14:38.643
Who does she think
she is to just like

14:38.645 --> 14:40.278
casually bring up my miscarriage

14:40.280 --> 14:41.546
when you and Ben were
talking about whatever...

14:41.548 --> 14:43.381
We weren't talking about...

14:43.383 --> 14:46.384
Who do you think you're telling
her about my miscarriage?

14:46.386 --> 14:47.518
Who else knows?

14:47.520 --> 14:48.920
Greg?

14:48.922 --> 14:50.188
The rest of your friends?
Lucy?

14:50.190 --> 14:52.957
- Mar, she cares about you.
- Oh.

14:52.959 --> 14:54.292
She cares about us and she
was just trying to help.

14:54.294 --> 14:55.526
Would this have
been a coincidence?

14:55.528 --> 14:56.995
Look, I am just...

14:56.997 --> 14:58.630
You know what,
I don't even care.

14:58.632 --> 15:00.064
I'm going home.

16:43.136 --> 16:46.471
I can't even imagine
how I would start a conversation

16:46.473 --> 16:48.673
and then when he
tries to start it,

16:48.675 --> 16:51.142
my ears start to close and I...

16:51.144 --> 16:53.578
I just don't have any interest.

16:53.580 --> 16:56.180
But you do realize
that this isn't gonna end

16:56.182 --> 16:58.049
until you open up.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.721
Yeah but he doesn't get
what it is like for me.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.323
Well maybe
because he doesn't know

17:05.325 --> 17:07.191
you already had two abortions.

17:15.667 --> 17:17.667
You want me to open up to him.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.470
You want me to let him in.

17:23.175 --> 17:25.209
How can I do that if
I don't even understand

17:25.211 --> 17:28.579
why I'm grieving for
a baby I didn't even want?

17:28.581 --> 17:31.616
You've suffered
a very traumatic experience

17:31.618 --> 17:35.219
and isolating yourself is not
gonna make it easier for him.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.624
So, what, you want
me to go and say,

17:39.626 --> 17:42.827
"Hey, Mark, stop looking at
me with those sad puppy eyes.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.495
I didn't even want a baby.

17:44.497 --> 17:47.198
I just did it because
you wanted one so badly?"

18:05.085 --> 18:07.251
It's really not of interest.
Sorry.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.719
Sorry to bother you.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.721
There's a woman
downstairs named Michelle.

18:10.723 --> 18:12.623
She wants to come up.

18:12.625 --> 18:13.658
Yeah, that's my mom.

18:13.660 --> 18:15.159
You can send her up.

18:20.500 --> 18:21.833
Hey.

18:21.835 --> 18:24.235
Yeah, sorry.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.503
What were you saying?

18:28.408 --> 18:29.807
OK.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.676
Sweetheart, get off the
phone and give me a hug!

18:31.678 --> 18:33.678
I'll have to call
you back. OK, bye.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.546
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.

18:36.749 --> 18:37.849
Listen, I know I'm early.

18:37.851 --> 18:39.784
Can I get you anything to drink?

18:39.786 --> 18:42.286
Oh no, we're fine, dear.

18:42.288 --> 18:43.521
Thank you, Lucy.

18:45.358 --> 18:46.724
I need to talk to you.

18:55.502 --> 18:56.701
So,

18:57.570 --> 18:58.736
how is she?

19:00.340 --> 19:03.641
She's great.
She's almost back to normal.

19:04.844 --> 19:07.411
Where do you wanna eat?

19:07.413 --> 19:11.182
You forget, I raised
you and three daughters.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.185
Is she still not talking to you?

19:15.421 --> 19:17.889
I know what I'm doing, OK?

19:17.891 --> 19:21.392
I know Mar and I am fixing this.

19:21.394 --> 19:23.694
"Fixing this?"

19:23.696 --> 19:24.795
She lost a child.

19:24.797 --> 19:27.598
You lost a child.

19:27.600 --> 19:31.802
This isn't a
distressed debt buyout.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.304
This is your family.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.672
You know what I mean.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.509
Is she still seeing her shrink?

19:38.511 --> 19:41.546
Yes... I think.

19:41.548 --> 19:44.849
Well maybe you two should
go see someone together.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.617
Or I could talk to her.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.519
No.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.188
Thank you.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.590
No, you're not talking
to her about any of this.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.959
Actually,

19:54.961 --> 19:56.561
I'm serious, Mom.

20:19.786 --> 20:22.787
I'm tired of being in my head.

20:22.789 --> 20:26.857
When I look at myself,
I see negative space,

20:26.859 --> 20:28.659
everything that's missing.

20:30.597 --> 20:33.731
I wish I could see myself
through someone else's eyes.

20:43.810 --> 20:44.875
- Hi.
- Hey.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.410
Look at you.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.846
Marin, this is Francesca.

20:48.848 --> 20:50.615
Hi.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.683
Jesus, I can't believe you
guys still haven't met.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.285
Yeah, I know,
it's great to meet you.

20:54.287 --> 20:55.853
I've heard so much from her.

20:55.855 --> 20:57.822
Well, thank you for letting
me crash your party.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.023
Of course.

20:59.025 --> 21:01.359
I also need you to meet.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.627
Remember, this is...

21:02.629 --> 21:04.595
Hey.

21:04.597 --> 21:05.930
And shots.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.965
We definitely need
birthday shots.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.875
On me, yeah.

21:17.877 --> 21:18.909
Shots, ladies.

21:18.911 --> 21:20.378
Yeah.

21:31.724 --> 21:34.025
- Hey.
- Oh.

21:34.027 --> 21:35.660
Oh, yeah,

21:35.662 --> 21:37.862
I tried but Marin has
this birthday thing

21:37.864 --> 21:41.032
with Isabel tonight, so I do
not think she's gonna make it.

21:41.034 --> 21:42.867
All right.

21:44.937 --> 21:45.970
Hi.

21:58.084 --> 22:00.451
When love is new,

22:00.453 --> 22:02.053
the world disappears.

22:03.089 --> 22:05.456
Nothing else seems to matter.

22:06.392 --> 22:08.092
You are entirely
inside your body

22:08.094 --> 22:10.494
and outside of it
at the same time.

22:12.365 --> 22:13.931
I want that feeling again.

22:17.036 --> 22:19.437
You didn't tell me she
was that beautiful.

22:49.969 --> 22:52.770
I just
want to touch someone new.

22:53.706 --> 22:56.374
We have too much history.

22:56.376 --> 22:59.076
Will I always feel this way?
I don't know.

22:59.078 --> 23:04.048
But now I need someone who isn't
yearning for who I used to be.

23:46.559 --> 23:50.194
What would you do if
you were single again?

23:50.196 --> 23:52.196
What would I do?

23:52.198 --> 23:53.731
I don't know.

23:55.535 --> 23:57.701
I just want to feel
desirable again.

24:14.086 --> 24:15.586
Is this seat taken?

24:20.226 --> 24:21.225
Hi, I'm Rachel.

24:21.227 --> 24:22.927
Hi, Rachel, I'm Mark.

24:22.929 --> 24:24.628
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.764
- Hey, I'm Greg.
- Hi.

24:26.766 --> 24:29.633
You don't wanna waste your
time talking to this one.

24:29.635 --> 24:32.069
What does that mean?

24:32.071 --> 24:34.071
That means that
I have a girlfriend.

24:34.073 --> 24:36.040
But why isn't she
here right now?

24:36.042 --> 24:38.042
♪ Truth be told ♪

24:38.044 --> 24:40.978
♪ What do you know of me ♪

24:40.980 --> 24:45.616
♪ Love, your love
will grow for me ♪

25:40.973 --> 25:42.139
I know that you're going

25:42.141 --> 25:43.807
to Connecticut today.

25:43.809 --> 25:46.710
Please, say hello to
your mother and sisters.

25:46.712 --> 25:47.945
Have a good time.

26:33.659 --> 26:37.161
This is not the life
I would have chosen for myself

26:37.163 --> 26:42.800
but you were loving and sweet
and you wanted it so much.

26:42.802 --> 26:46.637
It was like giving a part
of myself to your dream.

27:13.032 --> 27:15.966
When you're in pain
and afraid of something

27:15.968 --> 27:18.669
you'll do anything to
make the pain stop.

27:19.872 --> 27:22.406
I've succeeded in
making the pain stop

27:23.743 --> 27:25.976
but it just left me numb.

28:02.748 --> 28:04.114
Thank you.

28:13.325 --> 28:14.925
What?

29:09.482 --> 29:11.148
Hi, I'm Jonas.

29:15.321 --> 29:16.854
Anna.

29:16.856 --> 29:19.289
Hey, it's nice to meet you.

29:19.291 --> 29:20.824
You too.

29:23.462 --> 29:25.829
So, um...

29:25.831 --> 29:28.365
hotel bar, Friday night,
all alone.

29:30.402 --> 29:32.369
You're not working, are you?

29:35.474 --> 29:37.407
Were you waiting for someone?

29:37.409 --> 29:38.776
Professional, maybe?

29:44.450 --> 29:45.516
- No.
- No?

29:45.518 --> 29:48.485
Actually I am...

29:48.487 --> 29:51.855
I'm in town for a night for
my friend's gallery show.

29:53.292 --> 29:54.958
It's nearby.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.460
You should get a drink
and then come with me.

29:56.462 --> 29:58.061
What do you want?

30:02.067 --> 30:03.567
Well,

30:03.569 --> 30:06.303
I'll have a tequila

30:06.305 --> 30:08.172
with soda and lime.

30:08.174 --> 30:10.474
Mostly with soda
and lime, actually.

30:12.812 --> 30:16.213
Hey, sorry, can we
get a lime and soda

30:16.215 --> 30:18.448
with just a splash
of tequila, please?

30:18.450 --> 30:19.817
Thank you.

30:21.554 --> 30:24.388
So when are you
going back to Paris?

30:24.390 --> 30:27.457
What makes you think
I live in Paris?

30:29.495 --> 30:31.595
No, I live here.

30:31.597 --> 30:33.330
Yeah.

30:36.468 --> 30:38.302
Thank you.

30:38.304 --> 30:39.903
Well.

30:44.176 --> 30:46.877
Um, do you like art?

30:46.879 --> 30:48.212
Mm-hmm.

30:49.481 --> 30:52.282
Yes, I went to art school.

30:52.284 --> 30:55.886
So I prefer looking
at it to analyzing it.

30:56.589 --> 30:57.955
Don't worry...

31:25.251 --> 31:27.584
Why don't you take a look around
while I go get us some drinks?

31:27.586 --> 31:32.356
Oh, and really try
not to steal anything.

31:32.358 --> 31:33.390
OK.

32:00.653 --> 32:02.219
Oh, thank you.

32:02.221 --> 32:04.121
You know that's me, right?

32:05.424 --> 32:06.690
Yes.

32:06.692 --> 32:08.959
You can't see my Speedo

32:08.961 --> 32:11.395
in this picture but it was...

32:11.397 --> 32:12.496
Tiny.

32:12.498 --> 32:14.598
It was pretty compromising.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.536
Oh, hey, you wanna
meet my friend?

32:19.538 --> 32:21.138
Oh yes, sure.

32:26.111 --> 32:27.544
Thank you guys for coming, OK?

32:27.546 --> 32:28.412
Take care.

32:28.414 --> 32:29.947
Sorry.

32:29.949 --> 32:31.181
- Hey, man.
- How're you doing, man?

32:31.183 --> 32:32.482
- Good to see you!
- Good to see you.

32:32.484 --> 32:33.717
- Yeah, thanks, man.
- Congratulations.

32:33.719 --> 32:35.585
Thanks for coming,
I appreciate it.

32:35.587 --> 32:36.687
- Hey, there's somebody you should meet.
- Hi, I'm Anna.

32:36.689 --> 32:38.188
Anna, nice to meet you.

32:38.190 --> 32:39.256
You taking care
of this guy, here?

32:39.258 --> 32:40.324
Because you gotta watch him.

32:40.326 --> 32:41.391
No, strangely, she's not.

32:41.393 --> 32:42.359
No, yeah.

32:42.361 --> 32:43.627
You know.

32:43.629 --> 32:45.062
Could you take
care of me please?

32:45.064 --> 32:46.163
No.
Your photos are beautiful.

32:46.165 --> 32:47.064
Thank you, I appreciate that.

32:47.066 --> 32:47.998
They're OK.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.733
- Yeah.
- Well.

32:49.735 --> 32:52.169
And I guess it's a long way
from Bolivia to here, isn't it?

32:52.171 --> 32:53.403
You tell her about everything?

32:53.405 --> 32:55.439
- Not everything.
- Thank you.

32:55.441 --> 32:57.441
Excuse me.

32:57.443 --> 32:58.742
OK, all right.

32:58.744 --> 33:00.210
Sorry, I'll be right back.

33:00.212 --> 33:01.345
- OK.
- Sure.

33:01.347 --> 33:02.412
Thank you.

33:02.414 --> 33:03.613
He's nice.

33:04.683 --> 33:06.249
Yeah, he's really nice.

33:06.251 --> 33:08.051
You know what,
let's get out of here.

33:08.053 --> 33:09.653
OK, wait, no. Wait.

33:09.655 --> 33:12.990
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.

33:15.661 --> 33:18.562
So, did you get stood up

33:18.564 --> 33:22.299
or do you just like hanging
out in hotel bars all alone?

33:22.301 --> 33:26.036
Yeah, no, I don't usually
hang out in hotel bars alone.

33:27.172 --> 33:28.472
Is he your boyfriend?

33:28.474 --> 33:30.240
No.

33:30.242 --> 33:33.377
A friend from out of town.

33:33.379 --> 33:35.612
His flight got messed up.

33:35.614 --> 33:38.648
Or he just flaked, I don't know.
It doesn't matter.

33:38.650 --> 33:39.783
Is he your ex?

33:40.652 --> 33:42.652
Something like that.

33:42.654 --> 33:44.388
You ask a lot of questions.

33:44.390 --> 33:46.056
I don't ask a lot of questions.

33:46.058 --> 33:48.025
I ask, you know, just
like the good questions.

33:48.027 --> 33:49.459
Yeah.

33:49.461 --> 33:51.028
So were you planning
on sleeping with him?

33:51.030 --> 33:53.130
What?

33:53.132 --> 33:55.298
You don't look
like you're dressed

33:55.300 --> 33:56.733
to catch up with an old friend.

33:56.735 --> 33:58.702
You look like you're
dressed for a date.

34:02.174 --> 34:06.376
I wouldn't say I'd plan on it

34:06.378 --> 34:09.478
but I wouldn't say I plan
on much the last few months.

34:11.250 --> 34:13.083
What does that mean?

34:14.253 --> 34:16.453
OK, tell me something
about yourself.

34:19.458 --> 34:22.759
OK, well, would it
be too forward to say

34:22.761 --> 34:27.264
that I really, really,

34:27.266 --> 34:29.199
really wanna kiss you?

34:30.235 --> 34:31.668
Don't spoil everything.

34:31.670 --> 34:34.137
- Oh.
- OK, where are we going?

34:34.139 --> 34:36.706
We're gonna get another drink.

34:36.708 --> 34:39.476
I don't really drink.

34:39.478 --> 34:41.478
I'll decide where we're going.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.681
OK.

35:00.132 --> 35:01.364
- This is great.
- Yeah.

35:01.366 --> 35:02.833
This was a good decision.

35:02.835 --> 35:05.735
Hey, could we get an
order of fries, please?

35:05.737 --> 35:07.337
Yes.

35:07.339 --> 35:10.273
And two tequilas on
the rocks, please.

35:10.275 --> 35:11.641
And some water.

35:11.643 --> 35:13.110
Thank you.

35:15.547 --> 35:16.746
OK, so.

35:16.748 --> 35:18.548
So.

35:18.550 --> 35:19.583
- So.
- So.

35:20.552 --> 35:21.751
Where's home for you?

35:21.753 --> 35:24.621
Home? Where's home?

35:25.691 --> 35:28.425
- Between L.A. and Chicago.
- Oh.

35:28.427 --> 35:31.261
L.A. by choice and Chicago by.

35:32.264 --> 35:34.531
I guess, necessity.

35:34.533 --> 35:35.732
Hmm.

35:39.638 --> 35:41.204
Do you like my hair?

35:41.206 --> 35:43.173
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't usually have bangs

35:43.175 --> 35:46.610
but my hairdresser just put
them in to see if I like them.

35:46.612 --> 35:49.779
- Do you like them?
- Mm-hmm, I do actually.

35:49.781 --> 35:51.348
I think I'm gonna keep it.

35:51.350 --> 35:53.683
You should definitely keep it.

35:53.685 --> 35:54.618
Thank you.

35:54.620 --> 35:55.752
Thank you.

35:55.754 --> 35:56.887
Where's home for you?

35:56.889 --> 35:58.622
Oh, well,

35:58.624 --> 36:00.924
I grew up in Paris,
so that will always be home

36:00.926 --> 36:02.726
but my mom is American

36:02.728 --> 36:06.163
and I lived in Tribeca
for a long time now.

36:06.165 --> 36:08.165
So, I guess that's home.

36:08.167 --> 36:09.499
Huh.

36:11.803 --> 36:13.336
Oh, God, OK.

36:14.506 --> 36:15.805
Salty.

36:15.807 --> 36:18.575
"Salty."

36:20.812 --> 36:22.812
Ugh.

36:23.949 --> 36:25.949
Oh, my God.

36:25.951 --> 36:27.651
Yes.

36:31.256 --> 36:33.323
Do you live with your boyfriend?

36:34.860 --> 36:36.660
Do you live with yours?

36:40.766 --> 36:42.399
My kid is in Chicago.

36:42.401 --> 36:43.366
Oh.

36:43.368 --> 36:45.268
And my work's in L.A.

36:45.270 --> 36:46.903
Necessity. I get it.

36:46.905 --> 36:50.607
I got a girl pregnant and
now I got an 11 year old boy

36:50.609 --> 36:53.944
and a lot of...

36:55.280 --> 36:58.515
air miles.

36:58.517 --> 37:00.483
Well I don't live
with my boyfriend.

37:00.485 --> 37:01.484
No?

37:01.486 --> 37:02.552
Mm-hmm.

37:02.554 --> 37:03.987
Are you still with the mom?

37:03.989 --> 37:06.856
- No.
- No?

37:06.858 --> 37:08.325
No, she's unbalanced

37:08.327 --> 37:12.262
and not the fun kind either, so.

37:16.235 --> 37:17.734
So is your ex coming back?

37:19.871 --> 37:20.870
Yes.

37:20.872 --> 37:22.572
- Yes?
- Tomorrow.

37:24.276 --> 37:25.809
You gonna go see him?

37:27.412 --> 37:28.812
I don't know.

37:31.984 --> 37:33.883
Does your boyfriend
know he's coming?

37:33.885 --> 37:35.986
Oh, my God,
OK one more question like this

37:35.988 --> 37:38.421
and this will start to
feel like an interrogation.

37:38.423 --> 37:39.889
Fries.

37:39.891 --> 37:40.890
Can I get
you guys another round?

37:40.892 --> 37:41.992
No, thank you.

37:43.996 --> 37:45.662
No, not an interrogation.

37:45.664 --> 37:48.365
Just think of it more
like a, I don't know,

37:49.034 --> 37:50.567
like an interview.

37:50.569 --> 37:51.635
Mmmm.

37:51.637 --> 37:53.336
Yeah, I'm like a journalist,

37:53.338 --> 37:56.473
I'm trying to get to the
bottom of this mysterious,

37:56.475 --> 37:59.342
gorgeous half-French,

37:59.344 --> 38:02.012
half-American artist.

38:02.014 --> 38:04.381
- You get the idea.
- Oh, my God.

38:04.383 --> 38:06.850
Oh, I love this song.
I have to go dance.

38:06.852 --> 38:08.718
When you gotta dance,
you gotta dance.

38:08.720 --> 38:09.853
I gotta dance.

You know what I think this
evening needs a little more of?

40:14.079 --> 40:15.678
Tequila.

40:15.680 --> 40:17.113
Oh, my God, again?

40:17.115 --> 40:19.182
What do you mean?

40:19.184 --> 40:21.551
We barely had any.

40:23.855 --> 40:26.089
Oh, thank you.

40:26.091 --> 40:27.791
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

40:29.060 --> 40:30.693
Mmmm.

40:30.695 --> 40:33.997
OK, tell me, the kid
you had 11 years ago,

40:33.999 --> 40:35.565
that was an accident, right?

40:38.870 --> 40:40.470
Well, I wouldn't want
him going around thinking

40:40.472 --> 40:42.038
that's what
I think of him, but...

40:42.941 --> 40:44.574
No.

40:44.576 --> 40:47.877
Yeah, I didn't
exactly plan it out.

40:47.879 --> 40:49.512
But,

40:49.514 --> 40:51.614
that was your only...

40:51.616 --> 40:53.049
My only accident?

40:54.119 --> 40:56.786
- No.
- No?

40:56.788 --> 41:00.023
There were a couple
more in my 20's and...

41:00.025 --> 41:04.227
the chances are those are just
the ones that I know about.

41:07.732 --> 41:08.932
Huh.

41:16.107 --> 41:18.608
I spent all of my 20's and...

41:20.212 --> 41:21.878
most of my 30's...

41:23.014 --> 41:25.648
going down rabbit
holes of various kinds.

41:27.152 --> 41:31.721
And I don't know where to tell
you to look for your answers

41:31.723 --> 41:34.791
but I can tell you,

41:34.793 --> 41:37.594
you're only gonna get so far
looking on your own.

41:37.596 --> 41:40.763
Sometimes you can spend so
many years looking on your own

41:40.765 --> 41:43.967
that you lose the chance
to have it any other way.

41:46.137 --> 41:47.537
Wow.

41:49.908 --> 41:53.042
Well, I don't know if I want
to look for answers or anything.

41:55.180 --> 41:57.914
Just hearing you talk about

41:57.916 --> 42:01.017
spending years
looking for something,

42:02.153 --> 42:04.721
it's tiring just to listen to.

42:11.029 --> 42:13.296
I don't know,
maybe I'm tired of my life

42:13.298 --> 42:15.832
or myself, I don't know

42:15.834 --> 42:19.669
but I don't want to spend
my 30's looking for anything.

42:29.548 --> 42:30.914
Hey.

42:34.953 --> 42:36.719
I'd rather not go home tonight,

42:36.721 --> 42:38.855
do you mind if I stay?

45:24.389 --> 45:26.022
I mean, Jake's not bad.

45:26.024 --> 45:29.058
He's a nice guy, hard working.

45:29.060 --> 45:32.261
Got green eyes, looks like
he's got a lot of hair

45:32.263 --> 45:34.263
under that beanie.

45:34.265 --> 45:35.498
Oh.

45:35.500 --> 45:37.934
No cancer in his family either.

45:37.936 --> 45:40.870
Kind of looking good here.

45:40.872 --> 45:44.373
Oh, he went to
Princeton, bummer.

45:44.375 --> 45:45.908
Ew, Sara.

45:48.279 --> 45:49.212
"Ew,"

45:49.214 --> 45:50.813
what?

45:50.815 --> 45:52.215
Ew, Princeton?

45:52.217 --> 45:53.883
Ew, hair?

45:53.885 --> 45:55.451
Ew, you didn't even look.

45:57.155 --> 45:58.354
OK.

46:00.992 --> 46:03.326
OK, fine, take it back.

46:03.328 --> 46:05.461
- Totally hot.
- He's cute.

46:05.463 --> 46:06.963
Right, Mom?

46:06.965 --> 46:08.531
Yes. Totally hot.

46:08.533 --> 46:10.900
Could you please just
wait until after breakfast

46:10.902 --> 46:12.902
before you start breeding her?

46:12.904 --> 46:16.305
Oh, "her?"

46:16.307 --> 46:20.343
Well, "she" has been looking
for a sperm donor for months

46:20.345 --> 46:22.945
and "she" is on a clock.

46:22.947 --> 46:25.314
Why don't you just have
a kid the normal way?

46:25.316 --> 46:27.116
The "normal way?"

46:27.118 --> 46:30.052
Oh, my Gosh, where's your
empathy gene this morning?

46:30.054 --> 46:32.388
Nice, Mark,
do you see a guy around?

46:35.193 --> 46:36.526
There she is.

46:36.528 --> 46:38.528
Hi, monkey.

46:43.034 --> 46:45.134
Mommy, may I please
have some French toast?

46:45.136 --> 46:46.869
But of course you may.

46:49.240 --> 46:51.073
Robbie, baby,

46:51.075 --> 46:52.441
your French toast will
ready in two minutes.

46:52.443 --> 46:53.943
Do you want whipped cream?

46:53.945 --> 46:55.244
Yes, please.

46:55.246 --> 46:56.512
It's not like
I have a boyfriend,

46:56.514 --> 46:58.080
you know what I'm saying?

46:58.082 --> 47:00.016
I mean, I'm not even
sure at this point

47:00.018 --> 47:02.185
that I want a boyfriend.
What I want is a baby.

47:02.187 --> 47:03.853
I really wanna have a baby

47:04.556 --> 47:05.822
and I'm gonna do this.

47:05.824 --> 47:07.957
I'm gonna do this.

47:07.959 --> 47:10.226
I want one like you,
with those little cheekies.

47:15.200 --> 47:17.133
Do you think Mar
is gonna want them?

47:17.135 --> 47:19.302
You know, like, try again?

47:20.972 --> 47:22.505
I don't know.

47:22.507 --> 47:24.173
You guys totally should.

47:24.175 --> 47:26.843
It'll be like the
cutest baby ever.

47:26.845 --> 47:29.545
You know, you should
think about Mom's plumber.

47:29.547 --> 47:30.880
What's his name, Mom?

47:30.882 --> 47:32.615
- Roberto?
- Roberto.

47:32.617 --> 47:34.350
He's a very good looking guy.

47:35.253 --> 47:36.419
Square jaw line.

47:36.421 --> 47:37.420
He's a very good kisser.

47:37.422 --> 47:39.288
I gotta say, he is hot.

47:39.290 --> 47:41.357
I'm not having a baby
with Roberto, guys.

47:41.359 --> 47:43.526
Could you imagine,
anytime I needed something,

47:43.528 --> 47:46.028
he'd be fixing someone's
pipes in Westchester.

47:47.265 --> 47:48.464
Cherry!

47:48.466 --> 47:49.899
Thank you, Grandma.

47:49.901 --> 47:51.000
Yum.

47:51.002 --> 47:52.201
You're welcome, darling.

47:53.037 --> 47:54.904
Your lucky day.

47:54.906 --> 47:56.505
Can I have some?

47:56.507 --> 47:57.907
Can I eat if first?

48:10.989 --> 48:12.588
Have you guys been talking?

48:17.528 --> 48:19.929
I've barely even seen her.

48:21.633 --> 48:24.200
Hmm.

48:24.202 --> 48:27.036
We went out to dinner
a couple of nights ago

48:27.038 --> 48:28.537
with some friends of mine.

48:29.674 --> 48:32.208
It was like she was
barely even there.

48:35.313 --> 48:37.680
She doesn't really
wanna talk about it.

48:39.183 --> 48:40.516
To be honest,

48:40.518 --> 48:43.286
I'm not sure that
I want to anymore either.

49:07.512 --> 49:10.579
I know you're tired
of talking about it.

49:10.581 --> 49:13.249
I know how exhausting it is

49:13.251 --> 49:17.186
and you're always the last one
to complain about anything.

49:17.188 --> 49:19.422
So I don't bring it
up to pick at a wound.

49:19.424 --> 49:21.724
It's just important to
me to keep reminding you

49:21.726 --> 49:23.225
how much I care

49:23.227 --> 49:25.461
and how we are
always here for you.

49:27.231 --> 49:29.598
We always pick the
complicated ones.

49:32.170 --> 49:34.370
Keep things interesting though,

49:34.372 --> 49:36.472
I guess.

49:37.976 --> 49:40.576
She'll come around.

49:40.578 --> 49:42.378
I haven't gone through
what she's gone through

49:42.380 --> 49:44.714
but I know her.

49:46.017 --> 49:47.717
I know that it'll work out.

50:20.118 --> 50:22.585
I sat alone at the hotel
bar like a cheap hooker.

50:22.587 --> 50:25.488
Did you not think to just
text me a few hours earlier

50:25.490 --> 50:27.556
just to let me know?

51:42.100 --> 51:43.599
Hey, girl, what's up?

51:43.601 --> 51:45.267
Hey, can you come over?

51:45.269 --> 51:47.403
Yeah, totally. I'm just picking
up a few things.

51:47.405 --> 51:48.571
OK, cool, see you soon.

51:48.573 --> 51:49.872
I'll be right over.

51:57.381 --> 51:58.781
OK.

52:28.179 --> 52:29.378
Coming!

52:37.321 --> 52:39.522
Oh, that was so fast.

52:39.524 --> 52:41.290
I know.

52:41.292 --> 52:43.192
I was just pulling looks at
a store a few blocks away

52:43.194 --> 52:44.260
from my shoot on Monday.

52:44.262 --> 52:45.828
You OK?

52:45.830 --> 52:47.830
Not really.

52:47.832 --> 52:49.431
Do you mind if I smoke?

52:49.433 --> 52:50.466
Yeah.

52:52.737 --> 52:54.303
Max is in New York.

52:54.305 --> 52:56.639
Whoa. When was the last
time you saw him?

52:56.641 --> 52:58.908
Also, when the fuck
did you get bangs?

52:58.910 --> 53:01.410
Oh, they did them yesterday
to see if I liked them.

53:01.412 --> 53:03.779
They look fantastic on you,
you have to keep them.

53:03.781 --> 53:06.215
You've gotta make
those permanent.

53:06.217 --> 53:07.783
Sorry, sorry, Max.

53:07.785 --> 53:11.854
Yeah, so I found a note
in my mail from him,

53:11.856 --> 53:13.656
so I sent him a message

53:13.658 --> 53:15.758
and he asked me to meet
him for drinks at his hotel

53:15.760 --> 53:18.794
and I'm sitting at
the bar and he texts me

53:18.796 --> 53:20.796
telling me he had
to change his flight

53:20.798 --> 53:22.364
and is coming the next day.

53:22.366 --> 53:23.966
So nothing's changed.

53:23.968 --> 53:25.234
No.

53:25.236 --> 53:26.535
Are you gonna meet him?

53:26.537 --> 53:27.603
Mm-hmm.

53:27.605 --> 53:30.639
I'm meeting him for dinner.

53:30.641 --> 53:33.776
We haven't seen each
other in over four years.

53:33.778 --> 53:36.312
We stopped talking when
I started seeing Mark.

53:36.314 --> 53:37.680
Mmmm.

53:37.682 --> 53:39.848
I wonder if he still
looks the same.

53:39.850 --> 53:41.450
Yeah.

53:42.853 --> 53:43.852
Does Mark know he's in town?

53:43.854 --> 53:45.721
No.

53:45.723 --> 53:47.656
I'd have to go back
to the beginning

53:47.658 --> 53:50.893
and get into literally
everything about Max

53:50.895 --> 53:53.462
and I just don't
need that right now.

53:54.398 --> 53:55.864
And Mark doesn't either.

53:55.866 --> 53:57.900
Mark still doesn't
know about Max, right?

53:57.902 --> 53:59.735
No.

53:59.737 --> 54:02.571
So, he doesn't know that you
were ever pregnant before?

54:02.573 --> 54:03.872
No.

54:03.874 --> 54:05.574
Neither of them do.

54:10.982 --> 54:13.649
Is it bad that I am
a little excited?

54:13.651 --> 54:16.485
It's bad that you're
only a little excited.

54:16.487 --> 54:18.020
It's Max.

54:18.022 --> 54:20.990
Have you decided if you're
gonna sleep with him?

54:22.026 --> 54:23.525
Wait.

54:32.803 --> 54:34.036
Wow.

54:35.539 --> 54:37.406
Wow.

54:37.408 --> 54:39.908
He took this just after
we started dating.

54:42.480 --> 54:45.381
How have I never
seen this before?

54:45.383 --> 54:47.049
I don't know.

54:47.051 --> 54:49.985
I put that in a box
under my skirts.

54:49.987 --> 54:52.021
I haven't looked
at it in a year.

54:52.023 --> 54:53.922
Does he do this professionally?

54:53.924 --> 54:55.624
No clue, no.

54:55.626 --> 54:57.960
He used to do that just
for fun but who knows?

54:59.297 --> 55:01.463
You nervous.

55:01.465 --> 55:02.598
Yeah, a little.

55:03.501 --> 55:05.301
What if it's weird?

55:05.303 --> 55:07.503
No, won't be weird.

55:07.505 --> 55:10.339
I mean, look, he's a dick
for flaking last night

55:10.341 --> 55:13.442
but it definitely
won't be weird.

55:13.444 --> 55:14.677
You think he's married?

55:15.579 --> 55:17.346
I honestly don't know.

55:17.348 --> 55:19.882
I know he was seeing
that girl from Miami

55:19.884 --> 55:22.918
but maybe he works in
the gallery, I don't know.

55:25.356 --> 55:26.855
Well you seem better.

55:27.958 --> 55:29.758
More yourself.

55:29.760 --> 55:30.993
Almost.

55:30.995 --> 55:32.328
You look like you
were having fun

55:32.330 --> 55:34.630
with Francesca the other night.

55:35.833 --> 55:37.066
It's weird.

55:38.903 --> 55:41.970
I have moments where
I feel like myself

55:41.972 --> 55:46.408
but it's like my body's here

55:46.410 --> 55:48.344
but I'm not in it.

55:48.346 --> 55:50.679
I'm, I don't even know where.

55:52.116 --> 55:54.917
But I had fun with you
on Thursday, thank you.

55:54.919 --> 55:56.452
I needed that.

55:57.355 --> 55:58.987
I don't know.

55:58.989 --> 56:02.424
I was bursting to tears
on my run the other day.

56:02.426 --> 56:04.927
- Almost?
- Yeah.

56:04.929 --> 56:08.797
When was the last time
you actually cried?

56:08.799 --> 56:11.867
On the plane coming
back from Paris.

56:11.869 --> 56:14.570
Honey, you haven't
cried in four years?

56:17.108 --> 56:19.375
Shit.

56:19.377 --> 56:20.709
What?

56:22.513 --> 56:24.880
I forgot, I'm supposed to
water my neighbor's plants.

56:26.517 --> 56:27.850
I wish I was kidding.

56:27.852 --> 56:29.551
You set an alarm?

56:29.553 --> 56:31.720
Who knew plants were
so high maintenance?

56:35.526 --> 56:37.025
I love you.

56:37.027 --> 56:40.963
Laughter is normal
and so is crying.

56:40.965 --> 56:42.564
I don't understand
how you haven't cried

56:42.566 --> 56:44.032
in four years or whatever

56:44.034 --> 56:46.034
but I think this is progress.

56:46.036 --> 56:47.569
Yeah.

56:47.571 --> 56:49.138
Have fun tonight.

56:49.140 --> 56:52.040
Seriously, just enjoy yourself.

56:52.042 --> 56:53.409
He's not a stranger.

56:53.411 --> 56:55.677
Four years isn't that long.

56:55.679 --> 56:58.113
Just, um...

56:58.115 --> 57:01.049
don't think so much for once.

57:01.051 --> 57:02.151
Love you.

57:02.153 --> 57:04.486
Love you.

57:11.862 --> 57:13.429
Uncle Mark?

57:13.431 --> 57:14.997
Where is Marin?

57:16.434 --> 57:18.901
She's in the city this weekend.

57:18.903 --> 57:20.169
I miss her.

57:23.474 --> 57:25.507
I miss her too, sweetheart.

57:25.509 --> 57:28.877
Hey, hon, you gonna
stay for dinner?

57:30.815 --> 57:34.216
You know, I think so,
just give me a sec.

57:34.218 --> 57:35.751
Be right back.

58:14.525 --> 58:15.958
Marin, um...

58:19.129 --> 58:21.630
I'm always gonna
be here for you.

58:49.126 --> 58:50.192
I'm staying for dinner.

58:50.194 --> 58:51.760
Fabulous.

59:04.842 --> 59:06.942
I know you're a good man.

59:06.944 --> 59:08.677
You're kind and steady.

59:10.014 --> 59:11.914
I probably don't deserve you.

59:13.183 --> 59:16.084
But you don't really see me.

59:16.086 --> 59:19.087
You see the idea of the
girl you met four years ago.

59:22.326 --> 59:23.825
She was perfect.

59:26.230 --> 59:27.729
I'm not.

59:34.204 --> 59:38.240
Everyone thinks about starting
their life over again,

59:38.242 --> 59:40.175
so they can somehow control it.

59:42.212 --> 59:44.580
But I'm living my life now

59:44.582 --> 59:46.715
and there is no
way to control it,

59:48.218 --> 59:49.918
so I just have to let go.

01:00:48.045 --> 01:00:50.145
Just a glass of water.

01:00:54.284 --> 01:00:55.784
Thank you.

01:01:08.098 --> 01:01:11.033
So, we'll have two
artichokes and two steaks.

01:01:11.035 --> 01:01:14.002
And for her, the sauce
on the side, please.

01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:15.270
Thank you.

01:01:15.272 --> 01:01:17.172
Still ordering
for people, I see.

01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:18.373
Just you.

01:01:21.345 --> 01:01:22.678
English.

01:01:23.781 --> 01:01:25.180
Did you forget all
your French already?

01:01:25.182 --> 01:01:27.749
No, I live here now,
so I speak English.

01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:35.223
You look good.

01:01:35.225 --> 01:01:36.892
Older but good.

01:01:36.894 --> 01:01:39.061
You too.
You look good.

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:43.465
Not older, but more astute.

01:01:46.336 --> 01:01:47.803
You look the same.

01:01:51.842 --> 01:01:53.408
I don't know.

01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:55.777
I don't even know
what to say to you.

01:01:55.779 --> 01:01:57.946
You look like you're
going to interview me.

01:01:57.948 --> 01:01:59.081
Just relax.

01:02:02.386 --> 01:02:03.485
Are you married?

01:02:05.355 --> 01:02:06.421
No.

01:02:07.391 --> 01:02:08.724
Are you?

01:02:08.726 --> 01:02:10.358
No.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:11.893
Are you still with...

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:13.795
- Mark?
- Yes, Mark.

01:02:13.797 --> 01:02:16.064
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.934
So you think you'll marry him?

01:02:21.305 --> 01:02:22.471
I don't know.

01:02:25.275 --> 01:02:28.310
Why did you send me a copy
of that thing about Julian?

01:02:29.179 --> 01:02:30.812
I don't know.

01:02:30.814 --> 01:02:32.881
It didn't feel right
sending you a message.

01:02:32.883 --> 01:02:34.382
You could've emailed.

01:02:34.384 --> 01:02:35.951
I don't like emails.

01:02:37.421 --> 01:02:38.520
It surprised me.

01:02:41.492 --> 01:02:43.859
And what are you
doing in New York?

01:02:45.329 --> 01:02:48.396
I'm here to see you,

01:02:48.398 --> 01:02:49.531
including Iesha as well.

01:02:49.533 --> 01:02:51.867
Your sister lives in New York?

01:02:51.869 --> 01:02:54.402
She's doing a teaching
program at Columbia.

01:02:54.404 --> 01:02:55.904
Wow.

01:02:56.774 --> 01:02:58.073
So tell me about you.

01:02:58.075 --> 01:02:59.407
What's been going on?

01:02:59.409 --> 01:03:00.876
How's Mark?

01:03:02.212 --> 01:03:05.413
Mark's good.
He's in Connecticut.

01:03:05.415 --> 01:03:07.182
Does he know you're with me?

01:03:07.184 --> 01:03:09.084
No.

01:03:09.086 --> 01:03:10.952
He doesn't know about you.

01:03:12.055 --> 01:03:14.823
I don't want,
I don't need him...

01:03:15.459 --> 01:03:16.992
He doesn't need to know.

01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:21.263
Hey, do you remember
my friend, Isabel?

01:03:21.265 --> 01:03:22.531
Mm-hmm.

01:03:22.533 --> 01:03:24.366
So you'll laugh,
I was in my closet today

01:03:24.368 --> 01:03:27.269
and I was looking at
that picture you took of me,

01:03:27.271 --> 01:03:30.939
you know, when we were living
in that shitty apartment.

01:03:30.941 --> 01:03:33.408
Anyway, I haven't
looked at it in years

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:36.077
and I showed it to her.

01:03:36.079 --> 01:03:37.479
I remember that photo.

01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:39.948
It's my favorite of you.

01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:41.449
Do you still take pictures?

01:03:41.451 --> 01:03:42.984
I am.

01:03:42.986 --> 01:03:45.353
I had a show
a few months ago in L.A.

01:03:45.355 --> 01:03:47.355
At Kate's gallery.

01:03:47.357 --> 01:03:49.090
Oh.

01:03:49.092 --> 01:03:50.525
You seem surprised.

01:03:51.428 --> 01:03:53.161
You always told me

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:54.563
that if you had to take
pictures for your work

01:03:54.565 --> 01:03:56.531
it would take out
all the joy for you.

01:03:57.568 --> 01:03:59.067
Things change.

01:04:00.204 --> 01:04:02.070
And do you still take portraits?

01:04:04.508 --> 01:04:07.375
Do you photograph Kate?

01:04:07.377 --> 01:04:09.911
Sometimes.
She doesn't really like it.

01:04:15.853 --> 01:04:18.520
I'm kind of shocked
you're still with her.

01:04:18.522 --> 01:04:21.056
Why is that?
You're still with Mark.

01:04:21.058 --> 01:04:24.893
Yes, but I enjoy being in
a relationship and you don't.

01:04:25.929 --> 01:04:27.395
At least you didn't used to.

01:04:27.397 --> 01:04:30.432
I was in a
relationship with you.

01:04:30.434 --> 01:04:33.068
I asked you to marry me,
if you remember.

01:04:39.243 --> 01:04:41.176
She's... She's easy.

01:04:42.346 --> 01:04:44.512
She's not complicated.

01:04:44.514 --> 01:04:46.281
Am I complicated?

01:04:46.283 --> 01:04:47.549
Yes.

01:04:47.551 --> 01:04:49.117
Well,

01:04:49.119 --> 01:04:51.119
I don't know,
it's been a long time.

01:04:53.023 --> 01:04:55.523
You were complicated, very.

01:04:55.525 --> 01:04:58.159
That's what drew me to you.

01:04:58.161 --> 01:05:00.595
I never knew what
I was getting with you.

01:05:00.597 --> 01:05:02.530
So, "easy" was what you needed?

01:05:02.532 --> 01:05:03.632
No.

01:05:03.634 --> 01:05:06.001
Yes, you wanted someone easy.

01:05:06.003 --> 01:05:08.637
Someone who didn't ask
you questions or push you.

01:05:08.639 --> 01:05:11.339
You wanted someone who would
let you glide through life

01:05:11.341 --> 01:05:12.941
without a care in the world.

01:05:12.943 --> 01:05:14.376
You're the one who left.

01:05:14.378 --> 01:05:16.478
I asked you to marry me
and you packed your bags

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:17.512
and left the next day.

01:05:17.514 --> 01:05:19.514
But I couldn't marry you

01:05:19.516 --> 01:05:21.349
because you didn't know what
you wanted to do with your life

01:05:21.351 --> 01:05:23.385
because you didn't know
who you wanted to be.

01:05:23.387 --> 01:05:24.519
Does Mark?

01:05:24.521 --> 01:05:25.654
Yes.

01:05:29.192 --> 01:05:30.959
You don't look very happy.

01:05:31.695 --> 01:05:33.662
You don't get to say that to me.

01:05:33.664 --> 01:05:35.497
Yes I do, you look sad.

01:05:35.499 --> 01:05:36.932
I'm not.

01:05:39.102 --> 01:05:41.069
You shouldn't
have sent the article.

01:05:41.071 --> 01:05:43.004
Well you shouldn't have come.

01:05:44.341 --> 01:05:46.508
I sent you the letter
because I had to.

01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:49.110
I didn't have a choice.

01:05:49.112 --> 01:05:50.345
I needed to see you.

01:05:51.481 --> 01:05:52.981
You could have
just thrown it away

01:05:52.983 --> 01:05:55.250
or maybe you should have.

01:05:55.252 --> 01:05:58.153
But you didn't need to come
here and make me feel this way,

01:05:58.155 --> 01:06:00.355
tell me what
I can and cannot say to you.

01:06:10.434 --> 01:06:11.466
I lied.

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:13.034
You have changed.

01:06:14.571 --> 01:06:16.504
You're getting even
more beautiful.

01:06:19.176 --> 01:06:21.076
How's your family?

01:06:21.078 --> 01:06:22.711
How's work?

01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:26.581
Work's been better.

01:06:27.417 --> 01:06:29.250
Mom's a pain, as usual.

01:06:29.252 --> 01:06:31.519
She and Dad just bought
a house in Ramatuelle

01:06:31.521 --> 01:06:33.388
so she's there a lot.

01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:36.057
Julian, as you saw,
is doing well.

01:06:36.059 --> 01:06:38.593
I see him every couple
of weeks for dinner.

01:06:40.297 --> 01:06:41.296
And you?

01:06:41.298 --> 01:06:42.664
How is your parents?

01:06:42.666 --> 01:06:44.599
I miss your dad.

01:06:44.601 --> 01:06:46.601
He misses you too, believe me.

01:06:48.772 --> 01:06:50.472
Mom was in L.A. last week.

01:06:50.474 --> 01:06:52.173
She's great.

01:06:53.744 --> 01:06:55.577
They're exactly the same.

01:06:56.646 --> 01:06:59.547
And do you think
Kate is the one?

01:06:59.549 --> 01:07:01.216
I don't know.

01:07:01.218 --> 01:07:03.018
We're engaged anyway.

01:07:11.661 --> 01:07:14.362
We had a baby six months ago.

01:07:17.401 --> 01:07:19.251
What?

01:07:19.252 --> 01:07:21.102
I don't understand,
what are you doing here?

01:07:21.104 --> 01:07:23.471
I mean, what are you doing
here in New York with me?

01:07:23.473 --> 01:07:25.106
I'm here to see you.

01:07:25.108 --> 01:07:26.808
But we haven't spoken
in over three years

01:07:26.810 --> 01:07:28.376
and you're engaged?

01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:30.178
You have a fucking baby?

01:07:32.682 --> 01:07:34.649
This is unbelievable.

01:07:37.187 --> 01:07:39.087
I don't even know
why I am surprised.

01:07:39.089 --> 01:07:41.189
That's so you.

01:07:41.191 --> 01:07:43.058
What is that supposed to mean?

01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:44.459
I had a miscarriage.

01:07:44.461 --> 01:07:46.227
My life is completely
turned upside down

01:07:46.229 --> 01:07:48.463
and you come back into
my life and you have a baby.

01:07:50.333 --> 01:07:52.434
I'm gonna smoke,
don't follow me.

01:08:37.781 --> 01:08:39.881
When did you have a miscarriage?

01:08:39.883 --> 01:08:42.216
A few months ago.

01:08:44.321 --> 01:08:46.453
I can't believe you have a baby.

01:08:47.756 --> 01:08:50.425
Is it a boy or a girl?

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:51.693
Girl.

01:08:52.562 --> 01:08:53.795
Her name is Vanessa.

01:08:56.666 --> 01:08:58.533
Are you OK now?

01:08:58.535 --> 01:08:59.801
Yeah.

01:09:00.770 --> 01:09:02.636
I didn't want a baby anyway.

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:10.719
I came here because I miss you.

01:09:14.917 --> 01:09:16.551
I think about you.

01:09:18.255 --> 01:09:20.455
Not always,
but I think about you.

01:09:21.291 --> 01:09:22.823
I worry about you.

01:09:24.394 --> 01:09:25.693
I wonder how you are.

01:09:28.365 --> 01:09:30.598
I had a baby and it made
me want to be with you.

01:09:32.536 --> 01:09:34.769
So, when I saw your
brother's piece

01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:38.907
I thought it was a sign
that I needed to see you.

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:43.845
It's funny,

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:46.613
I always thought we'd
have babies together.

01:09:47.684 --> 01:09:50.417
Not be together but,
I don't know,

01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:52.020
I thought we'd
make good parents.

01:10:01.731 --> 01:10:03.831
I went out with
someone last night.

01:10:06.836 --> 01:10:08.403
When you stood me up,

01:10:08.405 --> 01:10:10.672
this guy at the bar,

01:10:10.674 --> 01:10:14.509
we went out and I came
back with him at the hotel.

01:10:14.511 --> 01:10:16.778
It was nice spending
the night with someone

01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:19.681
who didn't look at you like
a sad girl who lost a baby.

01:10:35.232 --> 01:10:37.498
- You're jealous.
- Of course I am.

01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:44.872
Does Kate know you're with me?

01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:46.975
No.

01:10:48.878 --> 01:10:50.245
She doesn't know.

01:11:11.401 --> 01:11:12.800
I'm happy you're here.

01:12:00.917 --> 01:12:03.017
Do you still drink tequila?

01:12:03.019 --> 01:12:04.919
Yes I do.

01:12:04.921 --> 01:12:06.554
Good.

01:12:09.826 --> 01:12:11.359
That's beautiful.

01:12:14.597 --> 01:12:16.431
It's very you, this place.

01:12:16.433 --> 01:12:17.498
Mm-hmm.

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.467
How long have you been here?

01:12:21.037 --> 01:12:22.670
A year and a half.

01:12:23.606 --> 01:12:24.972
I love how quiet it is.

01:12:24.974 --> 01:12:26.808
My old apartment had a view

01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:28.810
but it was so noisy,
I didn't like it.

01:12:29.913 --> 01:12:31.646
Why don't you quit?

01:12:31.648 --> 01:12:33.715
I did.

01:12:33.717 --> 01:12:34.749
I cut down.

01:12:39.756 --> 01:12:41.022
Thank you.

01:12:54.404 --> 01:12:56.003
Are you happy?

01:12:58.074 --> 01:12:59.941
Sometimes.

01:12:59.943 --> 01:13:02.009
Sometimes is good enough,
I guess.

01:13:02.011 --> 01:13:03.745
It has to be.

01:13:06.015 --> 01:13:08.049
How is Kate?

01:13:08.051 --> 01:13:09.851
Blonde.

01:13:09.853 --> 01:13:12.587
Yeah, I know,
I don't usually like blonde.

01:13:14.858 --> 01:13:17.625
But she's smart.
She's beautiful.

01:13:17.627 --> 01:13:19.961
Do your parents still
have the house in Corsica?

01:13:22.031 --> 01:13:23.664
Yes, they do.

01:13:24.968 --> 01:13:26.834
I miss that pool.

01:13:26.836 --> 01:13:29.704
You remember, it was so dark
you could be naked in there

01:13:29.706 --> 01:13:30.938
and nobody could tell.

01:13:40.049 --> 01:13:41.616
How did you meet Mark?

01:13:42.552 --> 01:13:44.051
A friend of mine,

01:13:44.053 --> 01:13:46.554
she invited me to this
party she was going to

01:13:46.556 --> 01:13:50.758
and I was standing at the
window smoking a cigarette

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:54.095
and he came to me and he was...

01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:58.800
He was what?

01:13:58.802 --> 01:14:00.701
Nice...

01:14:00.703 --> 01:14:02.203
and not pretentious.

01:14:07.911 --> 01:14:10.211
Did you shut him out
like you did with me?

01:14:11.948 --> 01:14:13.614
He'd probably say yes.

01:14:17.086 --> 01:14:18.920
Did he want a baby?

01:14:29.532 --> 01:14:31.732
I'm guessing you're not
really talking to him.

01:14:33.570 --> 01:14:34.836
I'm not ready.

01:14:37.507 --> 01:14:39.640
Well, that's your problem.

01:14:41.144 --> 01:14:43.211
What is?

01:14:43.213 --> 01:14:44.946
You never wanna talk.

01:14:44.948 --> 01:14:47.882
You would rather keep
everything inside but

01:14:49.018 --> 01:14:50.952
that's no way to live.

01:14:50.954 --> 01:14:53.120
You sound like my therapist.

01:14:53.122 --> 01:14:54.622
He's right.

01:14:54.624 --> 01:14:55.890
You can't say that to me.

01:14:55.892 --> 01:14:57.058
What, the truth?

01:14:58.661 --> 01:15:00.094
You don't know me anymore.

01:15:00.096 --> 01:15:01.963
Stop the bullshit, please.

01:15:01.965 --> 01:15:05.066
You were the love of
my life, I know you.

01:15:05.068 --> 01:15:06.968
I know you always
shut people out.

01:15:06.970 --> 01:15:09.670
You used to do it to
me and it killed me.

01:15:09.672 --> 01:15:11.739
I can see you're
in a lot of pain,

01:15:11.741 --> 01:15:13.541
so why not talk to him about it?

01:15:14.811 --> 01:15:16.878
It's because I'm angry.

01:15:21.784 --> 01:15:23.084
I'm so angry.

01:15:24.287 --> 01:15:26.754
I didn't want to be
pregnant, he did,

01:15:26.756 --> 01:15:29.056
but now I'm the one left
picking up the pieces.

01:15:39.002 --> 01:15:40.868

I want them off.

01:21:37.026 --> 01:21:38.525
Marin,

01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:43.163
I'm always gonna
be here for you.

01:21:44.533 --> 01:21:46.634
Whenever you're ready,

01:21:46.636 --> 01:21:49.169
I don't care if it takes years.

01:21:50.006 --> 01:21:51.672
I can promise you that.

01:21:54.110 --> 01:21:57.945
But what I can't promise you is

01:21:57.947 --> 01:22:00.381
the way I'm gonna
be here for you.

01:22:02.184 --> 01:22:04.551
I really hope that

01:22:05.955 --> 01:22:08.222
it's as your boyfriend,

01:22:09.492 --> 01:22:11.525
your husband, partner,

01:22:11.527 --> 01:22:13.294
whatever you wanna call us.

01:22:16.132 --> 01:22:18.499
But one way or another,
life has to find a way

01:22:18.501 --> 01:22:21.468
to propel itself forward
and I can't,

01:22:22.705 --> 01:22:25.239
I can't be in
a relationship by myself.

01:22:27.476 --> 01:22:32.646
So know that I am
waiting for the call,

01:22:32.648 --> 01:22:37.651
a call to do whatever it
is that you need me to do

01:22:37.653 --> 01:22:39.119
to help me through this.

01:22:40.723 --> 01:22:43.557
But the day might come
when I am helping you

01:22:43.559 --> 01:22:46.994
just as an old friend
and that's all.

01:22:49.565 --> 01:22:51.432
And it won't be out of spite.

01:23:02.511 --> 01:23:06.413
It'll be because I can only
tread water for so long

01:23:06.415 --> 01:23:08.282
before my legs give out.

01:25:36.632 --> 01:25:38.365
Have a good day.

01:25:56.819 --> 01:26:00.287
Who says endings have to be sad?

01:26:00.289 --> 01:26:01.822
That goodbyes have to be sad?

01:26:03.192 --> 01:26:04.658
I don't agree.

01:26:05.494 --> 01:26:07.561
It's painful at first

01:26:07.563 --> 01:26:09.796
when a part of
yourself is torn away

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:14.535
but endings are the
borders that constrain you

01:26:14.537 --> 01:26:17.504
from going forward in your life.

01:26:17.506 --> 01:26:20.541
One needs to break free
of those constraints

01:26:20.543 --> 01:26:22.509
in order to move forward.

01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:36.783
Have you ever had a moment

01:27:36.785 --> 01:27:39.586
when your conception
of yourself slips?

01:27:39.588 --> 01:27:43.423
And you realize that the stories
you've been telling yourself...

01:27:43.425 --> 01:27:44.858
about yourself,

01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:46.727
for however long,

01:27:46.729 --> 01:27:48.528
aren't necessarily true.

01:27:50.432 --> 01:27:51.798
Sometimes you're alone,

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:54.568
staring out a window
at the sidewalk

01:27:54.570 --> 01:27:56.837
and it all hits you.

01:27:56.839 --> 01:27:59.673
You've become
something different.

01:28:06.015 --> 01:28:09.916
We can't have beginnings
without endings after all.

01:28:48.424 --> 01:28:50.357
Um...

01:28:50.359 --> 01:28:53.093
I don't remember what
I wanted to tell you.

01:29:00.336 --> 01:29:02.569
I didn't really know...

01:29:08.610 --> 01:29:11.411
I don't know, I feel like I,

01:29:13.082 --> 01:29:16.083
I think I felt sad, actually,

01:29:16.085 --> 01:29:18.919
because this thing
happened to us

01:29:18.921 --> 01:29:22.989
and I didn't feel like you
were there for me or anything

01:29:22.991 --> 01:29:24.891
and you were here,

01:29:24.893 --> 01:29:28.628
like you wanted to
pretend nothing happened

01:29:28.630 --> 01:29:29.996
and that we would be OK

01:29:29.998 --> 01:29:34.701
and that we had to
get back to our life

01:29:34.703 --> 01:29:37.971
but that's not fair because
that's not what happened and,
