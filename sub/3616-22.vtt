00:02.160 --> 00:04.628
Our next caller
is from Rohnert Park, California.

00:06.280 --> 00:10.432
Veronica, honey, tell Tashmin a little,
and I will tell you the rest.

00:11.640 --> 00:14.200
Hey, more "Dear Phoebe" letters.
Where do you want them?

00:14.360 --> 00:15.873
You can just put them anywhere.

00:16.880 --> 00:19.269
Maybe we ought to keep
some of these in storage?

00:19.440 --> 00:21.670
- No, I'll get to them.
- All of them?

00:21.840 --> 00:25.310
- Yes. I am on a roll.
- More like on a mission.

00:25.480 --> 00:27.072
Hey, will you get these
to Elise, please?

00:27.240 --> 00:28.753
And find out which one
she wants to run.

00:28.920 --> 00:30.592
Yeah, sure. Right away.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.710
You're amazing, you know that?

00:34.520 --> 00:35.953
What do you mean?

00:36.120 --> 00:38.111
What is your secret?
Herbs? Acupuncture?

00:38.280 --> 00:40.794
Do what Tashmin says
and get on with your life.

00:41.720 --> 00:42.835
Tashmin?

00:43.880 --> 00:45.757
I take it you don't believe
in psychics?

00:45.920 --> 00:48.673
You know, if it works for you,
I'm all for it.

00:48.880 --> 00:51.075
It hasn't worked for me for a while.

00:52.680 --> 00:55.877
You know how sometimes
you just find yourself

00:56.040 --> 00:58.395
going through a really bad period
in your life?

00:58.560 --> 00:59.913
Don't even get me started.

01:01.200 --> 01:05.318
Well, let's just say I'm finally
coming out from underneath mine,

01:05.480 --> 01:11.077
and nobody, nothing will ever
bring me back to that place again.

01:11.680 --> 01:12.795
Good for you.

01:15.320 --> 01:17.197
Help me, Phoebe.

01:18.080 --> 01:19.354
What did you just say?

01:20.080 --> 01:22.116
I didn't say that.

01:23.440 --> 01:25.112
She did.

01:26.960 --> 01:29.872
Help me, Phoebe.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:50.240 --> 01:53.038
Did they say how much longer
this was gonna go on for?

01:53.200 --> 01:55.475
Three weeks,
which means three months.

01:55.640 --> 01:56.914
A little higher.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.555
Well, better hope no demons attack.
That'd be a bust,

01:59.720 --> 02:01.836
especially if one of us
goes flying out the window.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.912
I wouldn't worry about that. There's
so much chaos in the underworld.

02:05.080 --> 02:07.389
- They're too busy fighting each other.
- I hope it lasts.

02:07.560 --> 02:10.312
I almost forgot what it's like
to lead a normal life.

02:10.479 --> 02:12.675
It's gotta go a little higher.

02:13.680 --> 02:16.194
- I need a ladder.
- Leo, just hover.

02:16.360 --> 02:17.998
No, no, no.
I don't wanna jinx anything.

02:18.160 --> 02:21.118
I'd rather we not use magic
unless we absolutely have to.

02:21.280 --> 02:23.635
- Thank you very much.
- Come on, Piper, relax a little.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.916
Use it or lose it, lady.

02:32.080 --> 02:33.513
Fine.

02:36.320 --> 02:38.117
See, no major disaster struck.

02:40.720 --> 02:43.359
- We have a huge problem.
- You were saying?

02:45.160 --> 02:48.072
- Cole tried contacting me again.
- What, more whisperings?

02:48.240 --> 02:49.798
No, this time he was channelling

02:49.960 --> 02:52.713
through a TV psychic
while I was at work.

02:52.880 --> 02:56.395
- He sounded so desperate.
- Wait, did anybody else notice?

02:56.560 --> 02:58.471
My highly suspicious assistant.

02:59.120 --> 03:01.111
How am I supposed
to move on with my life

03:01.280 --> 03:03.714
when I keep being haunted
by his afterlife?

03:03.880 --> 03:05.552
- Leo, what do you think?
- I think

03:05.720 --> 03:09.838
- you need to do something, fast.
- No, I mean how is he holding on?

03:10.360 --> 03:12.271
I don't know.
I guess because he's half demon,

03:12.440 --> 03:14.670
- it must be some kind of astral plane.
- Whatever.

03:14.880 --> 03:17.075
We can't risk him
contacting me again.

03:17.240 --> 03:19.913
I have to figure out a way to get to him
and find out what he wants.

03:20.080 --> 03:24.073
Honey, what he wants is you.
Why else would he be hanging on?

03:30.120 --> 03:31.678
Piper?

03:32.160 --> 03:33.593
Why is Leo frozen?

03:43.640 --> 03:45.278
Well, this is very strange.

03:47.440 --> 03:50.159
Guys, I think you ought
to take a look at this.

03:59.200 --> 04:02.715
So much for not performing
any magic, huh, Piper?

04:02.880 --> 04:06.555
Me? I didn't do that.
I couldn't freeze all that stuff.

04:06.720 --> 04:08.199
But I can.

04:10.280 --> 04:11.759
Who are you?

04:12.640 --> 04:15.359
I'm the Angel of Destiny.

04:15.520 --> 04:18.671
And I've come to change yours.

05:13.480 --> 05:16.278
He's not freezing.
Why isn't he freezing?

05:16.440 --> 05:18.237
You're wasting your time.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.278
I am beyond your powers.

05:22.120 --> 05:23.951
Besides, I pose no threat to you.

05:24.120 --> 05:26.839
Well, forgive us for not believing that,
but the last being we met

05:27.000 --> 05:28.718
who could freeze time
was a demon.

05:28.960 --> 05:31.110
It's because of a demon
that I've come to see you,

05:31.280 --> 05:33.510
which, in and of itself, is very rare.

05:33.680 --> 05:36.433
We Angels of Destiny
normally don't intervene.

05:36.600 --> 05:38.556
Except in extraordinary situations.

05:38.760 --> 05:40.159
Mozart at age 7.

05:40.600 --> 05:44.479
Michelangelo, Albert Einstein...

05:44.640 --> 05:46.153
...Britney Spears.

05:47.160 --> 05:48.388
I don't understand.

05:48.600 --> 05:52.275
You three have accomplished
something few others ever dream of.

05:52.440 --> 05:56.797
By vanquishing The Source of All Evil,
you have fulfilled your shared destiny

05:57.040 --> 05:58.871
much earlier than anticipated.

05:59.080 --> 06:00.957
Some of us didn't think
you'd ever achieve it,

06:01.120 --> 06:03.839
but that's beside the point.
What's important is you have.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.709
And because of that,
we are offering you a reward.

06:08.400 --> 06:13.190
A chance to chart a new destiny,
one of your own design.

06:13.520 --> 06:14.794
A reward?

06:15.080 --> 06:18.152
You can continue
to remain as you are,

06:18.320 --> 06:22.199
charmed,
vested with all your witchly powers...

06:22.360 --> 06:24.430
...and, of course, demonic burdens.

06:25.840 --> 06:26.829
Or...

06:27.960 --> 06:29.109
Or?

06:29.640 --> 06:31.676
You can choose
to relinquish your magic

06:31.840 --> 06:33.831
and lead normal lives again.

06:34.480 --> 06:35.879
Unencumbered.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.589
Free.
We'd wipe the entire slate clean.

06:38.760 --> 06:40.637
Nobody would ever
come after you again.

06:42.120 --> 06:46.113
- Well, what do you say?
- What do we say? Are you kidding?

06:46.600 --> 06:48.955
You can't just freeze the whole world
and come in here

06:49.120 --> 06:52.829
and drop a bombshell like that
and expect a quick decision.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.077
I don't care who you are.

06:55.440 --> 06:58.716
I don't think you quite grasp
the uniqueness of this opportunity.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.916
No, I'm grasping it.
But that is beside the point.

07:01.080 --> 07:03.833
The least you could do is give us
a little time to think about it.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.589
Think about what? No time needed.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.069
Thanks, but, no, thanks.

07:09.520 --> 07:10.794
Right?

07:11.480 --> 07:13.710
Yeah. Right.

07:14.040 --> 07:15.439
Of course, right.

07:16.360 --> 07:19.352
But, you know,
as long as he's offering,

07:19.520 --> 07:21.272
maybe we should talk about this.

07:21.440 --> 07:24.398
Just talk about it. Over there?

07:24.600 --> 07:27.433
Right over here, please. Now.
Excuse us.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.755
You can't be serious, Phoebe.
You, of all people,

07:30.920 --> 07:32.638
you love being a witch.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.792
- I know I do. But l--
- But what? What has changed?

07:36.040 --> 07:38.190
I don't know,
I became queen of the underworld

07:38.360 --> 07:42.672
and nearly died carrying baby Lucifer.
That's what changed, Paige.

07:42.920 --> 07:46.276
Paige, it's just that we've been
doing this a lot longer than you have.

07:46.440 --> 07:47.759
And I'm not trying to discount

07:47.920 --> 07:50.753
all the good that we've done,
or that we could do.

07:50.920 --> 07:54.959
But at the same time,
I'm not gonna minimize the costs.

07:55.280 --> 07:57.669
Paige, I can't get pregnant
because of what we do.

07:59.320 --> 08:02.756
Punching out demons
just isn't as much fun as it used to be.

08:03.240 --> 08:04.593
So, what are you guys saying?

08:06.000 --> 08:10.437
She's saying you need some time,
which I'll grant.

08:10.800 --> 08:12.472
But not too much time.

08:12.640 --> 08:15.598
After all, other people's destinies
are tied to yours.

08:15.920 --> 08:19.356
And since it's your charmed destiny
that's at stake here, majority will rule.

08:19.520 --> 08:22.318
Two sisters will decide
the fate of all three.

08:22.760 --> 08:27.038
So consider your choice wisely.

08:30.080 --> 08:34.835
Perhaps what happens next
will help you to decide.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.871
Hey, did you just freeze me?

08:43.080 --> 08:46.675
- No, dear, the Angel of Destiny did.
- Who?

08:46.840 --> 08:49.957
Yeah, you better check with the Elders
and make sure he's for real.

08:50.120 --> 08:51.348
I'm not kidding.

08:53.640 --> 08:56.393
- Hello?
- Don't talk, just listen.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.353
Darryl? What's wrong?

08:58.560 --> 09:00.994
Apparently, you guys are about
to be put under surveillance.

09:01.840 --> 09:04.877
An FBl agent named Jackman
called me into his offiice today.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.519
He did a search on unsolved cases.

09:06.680 --> 09:10.195
Apparently, your names came up
on way too many witness lists.

09:10.360 --> 09:11.839
What do you mean?
What does he know?

09:12.040 --> 09:14.031
I don't know,
but I'm gonna try to find out.

09:14.200 --> 09:18.637
In the meantime, just lay low.
And whatever you do,

09:18.800 --> 09:20.392
don't use any magic.

09:25.160 --> 09:27.151
So are we screwed?

09:27.320 --> 09:30.676
Maybe, but that would take destiny
out of our hands,

09:30.840 --> 09:32.637
and I don't think
that's what the angel meant.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.360
Okay, ix-nay on the angel-nay talk.

09:35.520 --> 09:37.112
Let's go upstairs. Come on.

10:17.280 --> 10:20.192
I still don't understand
how coming up here is gonna help.

10:20.360 --> 10:22.555
Actually, it's pretty simple.

10:29.240 --> 10:30.878
So you guys
have been home all day, right?

10:31.040 --> 10:32.519
Yeah. So?

10:32.680 --> 10:36.229
There's no way he would have had
time to bug the inside of the house.

10:36.400 --> 10:39.198
He's gotta be listening
from the outside.

10:39.760 --> 10:42.399
Is it ironic that here we are
presented with the opportunity

10:42.560 --> 10:45.950
to give up our powers, and now
we suddenly can't even use them?

10:46.120 --> 10:48.759
Except not using our powers
doesn't necessarily mean

10:48.920 --> 10:51.753
that we won't be exposed.
We still have Cole to worry about.

10:51.960 --> 10:54.633
Phoebe, you can't make contact
with a dead demon husband.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.950
Yeah, but if I don't, he will.
And then what?

10:57.240 --> 11:00.232
The FBl is outside,
and if they find out about us,

11:00.400 --> 11:04.029
it's gonna be the same thing as last
year. We don't want that, now, do we?

11:07.200 --> 11:10.431
So I'm gonna cast
the "To Find a Lost Love" spell.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.468
I mean, if Cole's soul
is on some astral plane,

11:13.640 --> 11:15.278
it should astral me there, right?

11:16.680 --> 11:19.069
Are you sure he even has a soul?

11:19.360 --> 11:21.749
Well, what else
would be calling out to me?

11:22.720 --> 11:24.358
Cole needs closure.

11:24.520 --> 11:25.999
And so do l.

11:27.960 --> 11:29.791
We will create a distraction outside

11:29.960 --> 11:33.077
in case your spell inside
creates any fireworks.

11:33.240 --> 11:34.753
Be careful.

11:43.240 --> 11:45.879
- Good.
- Come on through.

11:46.480 --> 11:48.311
Going through.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.631
Come on, man, let's get it moving.

11:51.720 --> 11:55.110
Must we spike the lemonade?
I don't know--

11:55.440 --> 11:57.715
That phone-company van
looks suspicious.

11:58.760 --> 12:01.718
- Why?
- Well, because it wasn't there earlier.

12:01.880 --> 12:04.917
And, besides,
he didn't put out any cones.

12:05.080 --> 12:06.593
That's what you're basing it on?

12:06.800 --> 12:10.031
Well, it's the best that I got, okay?
Now, are you ready?

12:10.200 --> 12:12.509
Why don't you just...to the street?

12:12.680 --> 12:15.956
Because what if somebody
drives around the corner mid...?

12:16.360 --> 12:20.114
Now, you just need to use
some of your God-given magic.

12:20.280 --> 12:22.032
Okay? Go.

12:47.040 --> 12:49.918
Anyone feel like a little cool down?

12:52.280 --> 12:55.158
- Let's go.
- Yeah!

12:58.080 --> 13:01.311
Easy, boys,
there's enough for everyone.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.757
Whither my love
Wherever you be

13:40.920 --> 13:45.277
Through time and space
Take my heart nearer to thee

14:01.200 --> 14:03.316
- Cole.
- What are you doing here?

14:03.480 --> 14:04.879
Nobody's allowed to be here!

14:05.040 --> 14:07.679
Here? Where is here?

14:08.720 --> 14:11.712
We gotta move fast. Come on.

14:26.040 --> 14:27.917
We'll be safe here, but not for long.

14:28.080 --> 14:30.753
We have to keep moving,
or the beast will devour us both,

14:30.920 --> 14:32.319
for eternity.

14:36.920 --> 14:38.990
I knew you'd hear my cries.

14:41.440 --> 14:43.317
- Cole.
- It's all right.

14:43.640 --> 14:48.270
You did the right thing.
The Source is gone, devoured.

14:50.640 --> 14:54.315
This is the wasteland,
where all vanquished demons end up.

14:56.880 --> 14:58.996
The beast feeds on their essence...

14:59.160 --> 15:00.434
...their powers.

15:01.320 --> 15:02.833
So, what are you doing here?

15:05.120 --> 15:06.599
Holding on to our love.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.950
I'm a demon with a soul, Phoebe.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.832
It's rather unique to the cosmos.

15:12.240 --> 15:15.516
That's why my soul's been able
to cling here, keep from moving on.

15:16.160 --> 15:17.957
Oh, but that's not healthy.

15:18.680 --> 15:22.355
Everyone has to move on, you know,
sooner or later.

15:22.840 --> 15:26.833
Yeah, well, that's easy for you to say,
you'll get to go to the good place. Me...

15:33.040 --> 15:34.393
Over here. Come on.

15:45.040 --> 15:47.918
Okay, you know, you can't keep
running from that thing forever.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.877
That's why I've been calling you.

15:50.040 --> 15:52.838
You can help save me. Save us.

15:53.400 --> 15:55.630
- How?
- Get Leo to get the Grimoire.

15:55.800 --> 15:58.314
That resurrection spell
that the wizard was after,

15:58.640 --> 16:00.551
you can use that to resurrect me.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.353
What?

16:02.520 --> 16:05.717
It's easy. I'll walk you through it.
All you have to do is...

16:08.560 --> 16:09.993
What's the matter?

16:10.160 --> 16:13.869
I can't use dark magic again.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.393
I won't.

16:15.560 --> 16:17.516
Not even for us?

16:25.160 --> 16:26.479
Phoebe!

16:28.200 --> 16:29.474
- Hold me!
- Help me!

16:33.680 --> 16:36.638
- Your powers!
- I don't have any powers!

16:44.240 --> 16:45.514
Phoebe.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.431
What's the matter?
What happened?

16:50.600 --> 16:53.831
- Something's hurting her.
- Something is killing her!

16:58.600 --> 17:00.352
Paige, here, reversal spell.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.397
Return thy love
Wherever she be

17:03.080 --> 17:04.798
Through time and space
Bring her back...

17:12.839 --> 17:15.148
It's okay. You're okay.

17:16.359 --> 17:17.759
Oh, my God.

17:17.920 --> 17:19.955
What was I thinking?

17:23.880 --> 17:26.348
I hope the freeze didn't wear off.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.433
Agent Jackman, FBl.

17:36.120 --> 17:37.394
We should talk.

17:46.840 --> 17:49.035
In case you're wondering,
that's just a copy.

17:51.280 --> 17:54.750
Nice way to engender trust,
Agent Jackman.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.468
If I wanted to expose you,
I could have done that six months ago

17:57.640 --> 17:59.278
when that file first crossed my desk.

17:59.480 --> 18:00.879
Expose us as what?

18:02.000 --> 18:03.115
Witches.

18:03.840 --> 18:06.593
It's the only logical explanation
for all the unsolved cases,

18:06.760 --> 18:09.991
the missing persons,
the mysterious deaths.

18:10.320 --> 18:12.038
Prove it.

18:16.240 --> 18:18.834
- Something's hurting her.
- Something is killing her!

18:19.000 --> 18:20.672
Paige, here, reversal spell.

18:20.840 --> 18:22.671
Return thy love
Wherever she be

18:22.840 --> 18:25.070
Through time and space
Bring her back to me

18:25.680 --> 18:27.671
That doesn't prove anything.

18:27.920 --> 18:31.913
No, but it implies everything,
especially when coupled with that file.

18:32.080 --> 18:34.150
You think your newspaper
wouldn't run that story?

18:34.320 --> 18:37.790
- What do you want?
- Believe it or not, your help.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.919
See, I specialize
in occult-style slayings.

18:41.080 --> 18:44.436
That's why I was watching you,
in hopes of catching a serial killer.

18:44.600 --> 18:46.113
A witch-hunter.

18:46.280 --> 18:48.919
All right, I've heard enough
of this nonsense.

18:50.440 --> 18:52.351
Wait a second, he froze before.

18:53.360 --> 18:54.634
This time, I was prepared.

18:56.520 --> 18:59.080
Like I said, I specialize in this stuff.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.953
Supposed to be only a few
of these amulets left in the world.

19:03.120 --> 19:05.395
Got this one
off the witch-hunter we're after.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.034
Her name is Selena.

19:10.880 --> 19:13.838
I traced her genealogy
all the way back to the witch trials.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.638
I think killing you people
is in her blood,

19:15.800 --> 19:18.234
it's what she lives for. I mean,
why else would she have burned

19:18.400 --> 19:20.789
her last three victims at the stake?

19:21.120 --> 19:22.792
Why are you telling us this?

19:22.960 --> 19:25.269
Well, because I thought
you were gonna be her next victims.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.715
But now that I know who you really are
and what you can do,

19:27.880 --> 19:29.950
I need you to help me find her
before she kills again.

19:30.240 --> 19:32.754
- Do you have any idea where she is?
- I did for a while.

19:32.920 --> 19:35.514
I had her in custody once,
but she got away.

19:38.600 --> 19:41.194
These are some
of Selena's personal belongings.

19:41.360 --> 19:43.715
Now, from what I know,
if you use your powers on them,

19:43.880 --> 19:46.189
you might be able to find her.
Now, you do that,

19:46.360 --> 19:48.510
I'll make sure those files
disappear forever.

19:48.680 --> 19:52.878
You don't...
Well, you figure it out.

19:53.600 --> 19:55.158
Call me.

19:59.480 --> 20:01.675
- I don't trust him.
- Gee, you think?

20:01.840 --> 20:04.400
Maybe we should take
the Angel of Destiny up on his offer.

20:04.560 --> 20:06.232
Great, so we'd be free
and so would Selena,

20:06.400 --> 20:08.038
who, for all we know,
could be a warlock.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.111
No, warlocks don't burn
witches at the stake,

20:10.280 --> 20:12.032
- they just steal their powers.
- Exactly.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.873
Powers, Phoebe, the very things
we were given to do good with.

20:15.240 --> 20:16.912
Remember?

20:17.480 --> 20:20.517
- Yeah, Paige, I remember.
- Guys...

20:20.680 --> 20:22.875
Do you really,
or has all that dark magic

20:23.040 --> 20:25.315
just kind of gotten into your brain?

20:25.480 --> 20:26.629
Guys!

20:26.800 --> 20:28.995
I can't believe you're so willing
to throw away our powers.

20:29.160 --> 20:31.230
Paige, you don't know the hell
that I've been through.

20:31.400 --> 20:32.719
- You didn't live it.
- Oh, really?

20:32.880 --> 20:35.269
I was just turned into a vampire,
and then I was shrunk,

20:35.440 --> 20:37.396
and then we switched bodies and--

20:37.560 --> 20:39.516
Okay, imagine going through that
for years.

20:40.160 --> 20:43.038
- All I'm asking is for my life back.
- Okay, guys, enough!

20:43.200 --> 20:45.111
We need to focus.

20:45.680 --> 20:48.240
What about you, Piper,
what do you think?

20:48.400 --> 20:52.075
I think we need to see this through
like the angel suggested.

20:52.240 --> 20:54.310
So, Paige...

20:55.720 --> 20:58.473
...you are gonna go up to the attic
and get started on this stuff.

20:58.640 --> 21:01.393
We will meet you there. Scoot.

21:01.560 --> 21:05.235
Leo! You can orb. It's all right.

21:06.160 --> 21:09.789
- What about the FBl agent?
- He already busted us.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.916
But, supposedly,
all he wants is our help.

21:12.080 --> 21:13.877
Find anything out
about the Angel of Destiny?

21:14.200 --> 21:17.317
He's legit, and so is his offer.

21:18.280 --> 21:20.919
Okay, can you do us a favour
and go get Darryl

21:21.080 --> 21:24.470
and make sure
that Agent Jackman is legit too?

21:24.640 --> 21:26.790
And, meanwhile,
we have a witch-hunter to find.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.877
Don't ask, just go.

21:33.880 --> 21:37.190
- Having a crappy day?
- Yeah.

21:38.240 --> 21:40.470
- Cole?
- Yeah.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.032
Phoebe.

22:12.640 --> 22:15.108
You don't want his powers.
You want me!

22:15.560 --> 22:17.357
Here I am. Come and get me!

22:17.760 --> 22:19.398
Come on! Hurry up, end this!

22:45.720 --> 22:47.517
This could be good.

22:57.040 --> 22:58.314
"Before the flame subsides,

22:58.480 --> 23:01.074
Iet wax from the candle drip
onto the crystal.

23:01.240 --> 23:05.074
Once consecrated, scry with
the crystal for the one who is sought."

23:10.040 --> 23:11.393
Ain't magic grand?

23:12.320 --> 23:13.639
Okay, bye.

23:14.600 --> 23:17.558
That was Morris. He confirmed
that there is a serial killer on the loose

23:17.720 --> 23:20.757
- doing exactly what Jackman said.
- We're all over it.

23:20.920 --> 23:24.629
He also said that Jackman has more
information on us than he shared,

23:24.800 --> 23:26.916
including our genealogy.

23:27.080 --> 23:29.355
Dating all the way back
to Melinda Warren.

23:30.320 --> 23:32.880
- What does that mean?
- They're gonna keep checking.

23:33.040 --> 23:34.758
It means he's gone through
a lot of trouble

23:34.920 --> 23:37.480
to get as much information on us
as possible.

23:37.640 --> 23:39.790
I got a bad feeling
he's not gonna let us off the hook

23:39.960 --> 23:42.190
so easily after this is all over.

23:42.360 --> 23:44.271
What, he's just gonna
keep using us afterwards?

23:44.440 --> 23:46.874
Great, Charlie's-freaking-Angels.

23:47.040 --> 23:49.235
This just keeps getting
better and better.

23:51.080 --> 23:53.594
Got Selena. Do we still go after her?

23:54.840 --> 23:56.319
Well, we don't have a choice.

23:56.520 --> 23:59.159
We can't let her run around
burning people at the stake.

24:17.680 --> 24:19.272
She has bodyguards.

24:19.480 --> 24:20.833
Lots of bodyguards.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.070
I wonder why Jackman
didn't tell us about them.

24:23.240 --> 24:25.629
Probably figured
we wouldn't help if we knew.

24:31.160 --> 24:34.357
Paige! Did you not have the sense to
sense if anybody else was in the room

24:34.520 --> 24:35.794
before you orbed us in here?

24:44.360 --> 24:45.793
Going somewhere?

24:50.720 --> 24:53.280
We're gonna need some serious
memory dust after all this is over.

24:53.640 --> 24:56.154
Yeah, well, we gotta get out of here.

24:56.480 --> 24:57.754
Phoebe.

24:58.040 --> 24:59.268
Cole.

25:05.680 --> 25:07.557
I swear, he was just there.

25:12.040 --> 25:13.951
Time to go. Orb, orb, orb.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.709
- Where is she?
- In there.

25:25.200 --> 25:28.397
You don't need that.
She's unconscious.

25:30.360 --> 25:33.670
- She put up much of a fight?
- No, but her bodyguards did.

25:33.840 --> 25:35.512
Bodyguards? She had bodyguards?

25:35.680 --> 25:37.398
Yeah, lots of them, with lots of guns,

25:37.560 --> 25:39.710
and they weren't shy
about using them either.

25:39.880 --> 25:41.632
Must have known
we were closing in on her.

25:42.080 --> 25:43.354
Still, don't you think it's odd

25:43.520 --> 25:45.829
that a serial killer
has hired guns protecting her?

25:46.400 --> 25:48.311
Well, maybe she's not
working alone.

25:49.800 --> 25:52.394
Or maybe you're just not telling us
everything.

25:53.360 --> 25:55.828
Maybe I'm not.
What are you gonna do about it?

25:56.000 --> 25:59.231
Well, for one thing, we're not gonna
let you take her without a warrant.

26:02.640 --> 26:05.677
You know, you're all the same.

26:06.080 --> 26:08.036
You think that just because
you have gifts, powers,

26:08.200 --> 26:09.838
that you're above it all.
You're special.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.956
- Well, I know different.
- Oh, really?

26:12.120 --> 26:14.588
Yeah. Your arrogance
is your Achilles' heel.

26:14.760 --> 26:16.159
That's why
witch-hunters and demons

26:16.320 --> 26:18.436
are always after you,
and they always will be.

26:18.600 --> 26:20.556
I wouldn't trade places
with you for the world.

26:24.720 --> 26:28.030
- Here's your warrant.
- So when do we get our files?

26:28.200 --> 26:30.191
When she's in jail,
and I feel I'm safe.

26:30.600 --> 26:33.353
- Safe from what?
- Safe from you.

26:36.960 --> 26:38.632
I don't wanna be another one
of those people

26:38.800 --> 26:41.439
who mysteriously disappear
around here.

26:43.520 --> 26:45.192
I knew he'd never give up those files.

26:45.360 --> 26:48.989
In case anybody is wondering,
we are officially screwed.

26:49.160 --> 26:50.434
Not necessarily.

26:50.600 --> 26:53.353
No. We are not
giving up our powers.

26:55.320 --> 26:57.880
Paige, I don't wanna give up
our powers either,

26:58.040 --> 27:00.315
but I don't wanna give up
our lives even more.

27:00.480 --> 27:02.232
He's just gonna keep using us.

27:03.920 --> 27:06.388
Unless we let the angel
wipe the slate clean.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.798
Look, Paige, we said
we would wait to decide

27:11.960 --> 27:14.269
until this thing played out, and it has.

27:14.440 --> 27:17.113
And frankly, if the angel
hadn't made this offer,

27:17.760 --> 27:19.273
I'd probably think differently.

27:19.440 --> 27:22.512
And I'd think,
"Let's just keep fighting."

27:22.680 --> 27:24.398
But I'm tired of fighting.

27:24.560 --> 27:27.472
And Jackman's right.
It is never-ending.

27:29.200 --> 27:31.430
Unless we end it ourselves.

27:34.480 --> 27:37.472
So do we need to talk to Leo
about this first?

27:37.960 --> 27:39.473
No.

27:39.680 --> 27:42.433
Doesn't have anything
to do with him, it's just us.

27:42.600 --> 27:44.431
And he will understand.

27:45.240 --> 27:48.073
You guys are only seeing the bad.

27:48.240 --> 27:49.958
What about all the wonder
of being witches,

27:50.120 --> 27:52.873
the stuff you introduced me to
in the first place?

27:53.040 --> 27:54.758
You're gonna let all that go?

27:54.920 --> 27:57.798
Paige, it doesn't
balance out anymore.

27:58.160 --> 28:01.436
And after everything that we've lost,

28:02.400 --> 28:04.118
it doesn't seem worth it.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.230
What about all the good we've done?

28:08.400 --> 28:10.868
- Doesn't that count for anything?
- Of course it does.

28:11.040 --> 28:13.156
But that's exactly why we have
this choice to make.

28:13.320 --> 28:15.993
He said we fulfilled our destiny.
We've done it.

28:18.440 --> 28:21.000
This is supposed to be
our reward for that.

28:21.880 --> 28:23.233
Yeah?

28:23.400 --> 28:26.233
Well, pardon me if it doesn't seem
like much of a reward.

28:26.400 --> 28:30.029
Because without being witches...

28:31.040 --> 28:33.235
... I wouldn't have sisters.

28:41.640 --> 28:43.471
Are you sure about this?

28:44.360 --> 28:45.509
Yeah.

28:47.760 --> 28:49.637
As sure as we're ever gonna be.

28:49.800 --> 28:52.075
You understand
this decision is final.

28:52.240 --> 28:54.071
There'll be no changing your minds.

28:54.840 --> 28:56.432
We understand.

28:57.480 --> 28:59.118
Very well.

29:04.120 --> 29:06.429
Hold it! Just so we're clear.

29:06.600 --> 29:10.388
This wipes the entire slate clean,
no "read the fine print" technicalities,

29:10.560 --> 29:12.391
no more demons,
no more vengeful warlocks--

29:12.560 --> 29:15.518
And we won't have to worry
about Agent Jackman anymore

29:15.680 --> 29:17.716
or anyone else who might
have found out we were witches?

29:17.880 --> 29:21.919
Exactly. Just free to lead normal lives
with no demonic aftertaste.

29:22.160 --> 29:23.559
Absolutely.

29:26.160 --> 29:27.559
Will we remember?

29:30.200 --> 29:32.509
Being witches, that is?

29:33.680 --> 29:35.352
You'll remember everything.

29:35.800 --> 29:38.030
This doesn't change your history...

29:38.320 --> 29:39.912
...only your future.

29:40.920 --> 29:42.990
And what about the Book?

29:43.240 --> 29:45.549
It will pass
to some future descendant.

29:47.520 --> 29:48.873
What about Cole?

29:49.040 --> 29:51.395
Will he keep trying
to make contact with me?

29:51.800 --> 29:53.995
I don't know.
I have no control over that.

29:54.680 --> 29:56.989
He exists beyond time and space,

29:57.520 --> 29:59.351
outside destiny's reach.

30:01.160 --> 30:02.832
What is it?

30:04.520 --> 30:07.910
It's just that he's still holding on.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.037
That's why he appeared to me.

30:10.200 --> 30:12.316
So maybe if I could tell him

30:12.480 --> 30:15.438
that I don't have
the power to save him,

30:15.720 --> 30:18.109
then he'll be able
to move on for good.

30:18.600 --> 30:22.513
I don't think that's such a good idea,
considering what happened last time.

30:24.080 --> 30:25.877
I can't leave it like this.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.031
I owe him more than that.

30:44.240 --> 30:45.673
Cole.

30:47.400 --> 30:50.517
I have to talk to you,
but I don't have a lot of time.

30:52.040 --> 30:55.191
- Did you see me come to you?
- Yes. I did.

30:55.360 --> 30:58.557
- How did you do that?
- It's a secret.

30:59.760 --> 31:01.512
I'm giving up my powers.

31:01.680 --> 31:02.999
We all are.

31:04.640 --> 31:06.551
- What?
- I don't have time to explain,

31:06.720 --> 31:10.508
- but it's true, which means--
- I know what it means.

31:12.400 --> 31:13.389
Cole...

31:15.120 --> 31:16.678
...we did the best we could.

31:17.160 --> 31:21.233
We tried every way possible
to make this work, but...

31:22.760 --> 31:24.273
It wasn't meant to be.

31:25.880 --> 31:28.792
And it wasn't because
we didn't love each other.

31:29.600 --> 31:31.636
It's just...

31:33.680 --> 31:35.159
...Iove wasn't enough.

31:36.240 --> 31:40.233
So now we have to move on, okay?

31:40.400 --> 31:42.277
The both of us.

31:47.280 --> 31:49.032
You better go.

31:49.720 --> 31:51.676
Before the beast attacks.

32:30.440 --> 32:32.476
Are you okay?

32:34.480 --> 32:35.913
Yeah.

32:36.240 --> 32:40.199
- Let's do this.
- Well, we've been thinking a little bit...

32:40.560 --> 32:41.879
Are you having second thoughts?

32:42.040 --> 32:44.918
Not about the decision,
unfortunately.

32:45.080 --> 32:47.071
About Jackman and Selena.

32:47.240 --> 32:48.639
Yeah, a lot of things don't add up.

32:48.800 --> 32:52.031
His extensive knowledge of witches,
he got ahold of that amulet...

32:52.200 --> 32:54.634
The fact that he came in alone
to pick up Selena.

32:55.080 --> 32:56.399
The bodyguards.

32:56.640 --> 32:58.790
We just wanna make sure
that we've done the right thing

32:58.960 --> 33:00.712
before it's too late
to do anything about it.

33:01.280 --> 33:02.508
Okay.

33:04.080 --> 33:05.399
Is that okay?

33:06.520 --> 33:08.351
Oh, sure, absolutely.

33:08.880 --> 33:11.474
Frankly, I thought you were being
a bit premature anyway.

33:11.640 --> 33:13.835
Then why didn't you say something?

33:14.000 --> 33:16.116
Can't. Free will, and all.

33:16.800 --> 33:19.109
Let me know when you're ready.

33:23.680 --> 33:25.398
So now what?

33:27.440 --> 33:28.759
Leo?

33:29.960 --> 33:34.033
- We were just coming to get you.
- Why? What did you find?

33:34.200 --> 33:37.112
Another genealogy Jackman has
besides yours.

33:37.320 --> 33:40.232
Well, yeah, we know Selena
is a descendant of witch-hunters.

33:40.400 --> 33:41.833
No, Jackman is.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.436
- Selena is the daughter of a witch.
- What?

33:45.800 --> 33:47.711
She is not a suspect, she's a victim.

33:47.880 --> 33:50.519
They have her in a safe house
because somebody's trying to kill her.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.151
Please tell me we didn't just help
a witch-hunter get a witch.

33:55.240 --> 33:57.196
Oh, my God.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.113
Oh, my God.

34:01.080 --> 34:02.718
Somebody, please help me!

34:02.880 --> 34:06.031
No one can hear you.
Not where we are.

34:06.200 --> 34:07.838
Please don't!

34:08.000 --> 34:09.319
No!

34:09.480 --> 34:12.199
- But I must.
- No! Oh, God.

34:12.360 --> 34:14.396
You see, it's my duty.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.355
It's what I was born to do.

34:18.120 --> 34:20.110
It's what I will continue to do

34:20.280 --> 34:24.512
until every last one of you is dead.

34:24.679 --> 34:25.668
Help!

34:25.840 --> 34:28.831
You're not gonna get away
from me this time, witch.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.991
Help.

34:38.120 --> 34:40.509
You're making a mistake.
I swear, I'm not a witch.

34:40.920 --> 34:43.911
Of course you are, Selena.
It's in your blood.

34:44.080 --> 34:45.956
Your mother was,
that makes you one too.

34:46.440 --> 34:48.078
Please, I'm begging you.

34:48.400 --> 34:51.551
You know why they burned witches
at the stake 400 years ago?

34:52.239 --> 34:54.435
So they would burn forever
in eternal fire.

34:55.440 --> 34:58.716
They used greenwood too,
made it last longer.

34:58.880 --> 35:00.677
Prolong the agony.

35:03.200 --> 35:05.270
No! Help!

35:10.120 --> 35:12.156
Come to save your sister witch,
have you?

35:12.320 --> 35:13.639
Actually, yeah.

35:17.080 --> 35:19.196
You see, I buried the rest
of the amulets around here

35:19.360 --> 35:20.952
in anticipation of your arrival.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.670
Your powers are useless here.

35:23.840 --> 35:25.558
However...

35:26.040 --> 35:28.952
...mine aren't. Move and she dies.

35:29.560 --> 35:33.235
It was his plan all along.
He was gonna kill us anyway.

35:33.400 --> 35:36.039
Hey, how's it feel
to be powerless, huh? Mortal.

35:36.960 --> 35:39.679
You're the scourge of mankind,
a blasphemy!

35:39.840 --> 35:41.432
Burning will be your justice too.

35:45.600 --> 35:47.238
Get Selena!

35:48.000 --> 35:50.116
Help me.

36:12.560 --> 36:15.120
- Piper, the leg!
- Hurry!

36:17.800 --> 36:19.074
What are you doing?

36:22.880 --> 36:24.472
Piper!

36:35.040 --> 36:37.474
Saving her life just cost you yours.

36:58.880 --> 37:00.154
Cole.

37:04.400 --> 37:06.436
I couldn't very well let you die,
now, could l?

37:07.400 --> 37:10.915
- I don't understand, how are you--?
- Here?

37:11.760 --> 37:15.673
Let's just say I picked up
a few powers lately.

37:15.840 --> 37:17.478
Quite a few, actually.

37:27.400 --> 37:29.868
I'm not giving up on us, Phoebe.

37:30.040 --> 37:31.268
Ever.

37:47.600 --> 37:49.989
Paige, you gotta go get the amulet.

37:50.160 --> 37:52.310
- Go, go, go.
- You're gonna be okay.

38:06.440 --> 38:09.159
Okay, okay, a little more.
A little more. That's good.

38:09.320 --> 38:10.435
Here we go.

38:17.120 --> 38:19.429
- Where's Paige?
- She had to park down the street

38:19.600 --> 38:21.591
because the driveway was blocked.

38:21.760 --> 38:23.318
That's ridiculous.
I'll go talk to them,

38:23.480 --> 38:25.311
- tell them to move.
- No, it's not a big deal.

38:25.480 --> 38:28.517
And to think, 24 hours ago,
that was our biggest problem.

38:28.760 --> 38:29.954
How'd it go?

38:30.320 --> 38:33.118
Well, it looks like we got away
with everything so far.

38:33.280 --> 38:35.191
Thanks to Selena testifying for us.

38:35.360 --> 38:37.112
What about
how Agent Jackman died?

38:37.360 --> 38:38.634
They're stumped.

38:38.800 --> 38:41.473
They can't figure out how he shot
himself from 20 feet away.

38:41.760 --> 38:44.433
What are they gonna do,
subpoena Cole?

38:44.600 --> 38:46.477
You guys stopped
one of their own from killing.

38:46.640 --> 38:49.029
- I think they'd be grateful.
- Yeah, one would hope.

38:49.200 --> 38:51.760
At least until they find
those files on us.

38:52.400 --> 38:54.311
They won't.

38:54.480 --> 38:58.439
I sort of orbed them into a volcano.

38:59.200 --> 39:00.679
You what?

39:00.840 --> 39:04.037
Excuse me,
are you allowed to do that?

39:04.240 --> 39:07.073
Well, my job is to protect my charges.
That's all I did.

39:09.720 --> 39:11.438
Thanks.

39:11.760 --> 39:13.990
Maybe, sometime soon,

39:14.160 --> 39:17.470
you won't have to protect your
charges. Are you okay with that?

39:18.160 --> 39:20.390
Whatever you guys decide,
I'll support.

39:20.560 --> 39:22.437
I mean that.

39:30.280 --> 39:31.713
The door's stuck.

39:35.640 --> 39:37.312
It's you.

39:37.480 --> 39:40.472
Well, still ready to retire?

39:41.800 --> 39:43.631
Actually...

39:44.040 --> 39:45.519
... I don't think so anymore.

39:48.080 --> 39:49.718
We saved someone.

39:49.880 --> 39:51.393
And it felt good.

39:51.560 --> 39:52.834
It felt right.

39:53.560 --> 39:56.836
Besides, I got a little taste of what life
would be like without my powers,

39:57.000 --> 39:59.833
and I didn't like it at all.

40:04.200 --> 40:05.474
What about you?

40:07.720 --> 40:09.597
Majority rules, right?

40:10.720 --> 40:12.995
Might as well make it unanimous.

40:13.160 --> 40:15.515
What can I say, we're masochists.

40:15.680 --> 40:19.309
- We are?
- Yeah, sometimes.

40:20.240 --> 40:21.753
But Phoebe's right.

40:21.960 --> 40:25.111
This isn't a choice we have to make.
It's who we are.

40:27.240 --> 40:30.232
You realize you
won't get this opportunity again?

40:31.080 --> 40:32.638
We understand.

40:34.160 --> 40:35.878
Very well.

40:38.920 --> 40:40.399
By the way,
thought you'd like to know,

40:40.560 --> 40:43.472
neither decision
would have affected yours...

40:43.640 --> 40:46.279
...and Leo's personal destiny.

40:46.960 --> 40:48.279
What?

40:48.520 --> 40:50.670
You'll find out soon.

40:52.800 --> 40:54.392
- Oh, my God.
- What?

40:54.560 --> 40:56.198
- Don't you get it?
- What?

40:57.160 --> 40:58.878
Don't you get it?

40:59.040 --> 41:00.473
- She's pregnant!
- Who's pregnant?

41:00.640 --> 41:02.756
- You're pregnant!
- I'm pregnant?

41:04.600 --> 41:06.716
Hi, baby.

41:07.760 --> 41:09.432
Hi, baby.
