In the Criminal Justice System,

00:08.142 --> 00:12.313
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.648
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.682 --> 00:16.517
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.550 --> 00:17.885
are members of an elite squad

00:17.918 --> 00:19.253
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.287 --> 00:21.255
These are their stories.

00:23.957 --> 00:25.093
It's nice to see you, Olivia.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.127
I'm glad you called me.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.295
It's been a while.

00:27.328 --> 00:30.598
Yeah, well, you know,
with work and Noah-

00:30.631 --> 00:32.866
Ooh, child in the house.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.168
That changes everything.

00:34.202 --> 00:35.903
You think?

00:35.936 --> 00:37.405
How's it been?

00:37.438 --> 00:41.342
You know, I mean,
between my lack of sleep

00:41.375 --> 00:45.479
and worrying about Noah
and, you know,

00:45.513 --> 00:51.018
trying to juggle my own
schedule, it's been...

00:51.051 --> 00:52.420
amazing.

00:52.453 --> 00:54.188
I'm glad to hear that.

00:54.222 --> 00:56.190
You know, he's just,
he's not a baby anymore,

00:56.224 --> 00:58.159
he's his own person.

00:58.192 --> 01:03.131
He's, like, such a boy.

01:03.131 --> 01:06.434
You know, last weekend
we had this playdate

01:06.467 --> 01:09.770
with these two adorable
little girls and, you know,

01:09.803 --> 01:11.539
they sat quietly,

01:11.572 --> 01:15.776
they just had a little tea party
with their dolls and,

01:15.809 --> 01:19.046
you know, within
a half an hour,

01:19.147 --> 01:23.851
Noah had broken the tea pot
and another one of their toys,

01:23.884 --> 01:27.921
and then he fell off the couch.

01:27.955 --> 01:31.825
He split his lip and
then proceeded to pull

01:31.859 --> 01:33.661
all of the books off
of the shelf.

01:33.694 --> 01:36.397
Sounds like a boy.

01:36.430 --> 01:41.935
You know, I just can't help
but worry sometimes...

01:41.969 --> 01:47.641
at night, about how he'll grow
up, with his history.

01:47.675 --> 01:49.943
You're not reconsidering
the adoption, are you?

01:49.977 --> 01:52.045
Oh, God, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

01:52.079 --> 01:54.748
I've already started
the paperwork.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.484
You know, boys run around.

01:56.517 --> 01:57.551
They break things.

01:57.585 --> 01:58.552
They hurt themselves.

01:58.586 --> 02:00.954
It's in all their D.N.A.

02:06.827 --> 02:09.397
Move and I'll blow
your head off.

02:09.430 --> 02:14.468
You want to hide now. Let's see
if you can handle this grenade.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.204
(Carisi)
Oh, look out!

02:16.204 --> 02:17.938
(Fin)
Damn.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.207
- Who did that?
- Behind you.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.209
I'll kill him.
Damn campers.

02:21.209 --> 02:22.410
What's a camper?

02:22.443 --> 02:24.512
Lazy creeps who just
hide behind stuff.

02:24.545 --> 02:25.846
Don't engage.

02:25.879 --> 02:27.581
Wait until you to run by
and then shoot you in the back.

02:27.615 --> 02:32.486
They're all pieces of crap.

02:32.520 --> 02:33.921
You were saying?

02:33.954 --> 02:37.358
Enjoy the tournament.

02:37.391 --> 02:40.228
This is awesome.
This is better than Comic Con.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.229
- Yeah.
- Really?

02:41.262 --> 02:43.231
Wait until you see
the main event.

02:43.264 --> 02:45.299
These teams practice
eight hours a day.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.700
They are not newbs.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.068
Newbs?

02:48.101 --> 02:49.136
Short for newbies.

02:49.237 --> 02:50.938
Oh yeah,
that's much shorter.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.575
Just hold these
two buttons down--

02:54.608 --> 02:56.777
Go home, gamer girl.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.078
What the hell
is your problem?

02:58.111 --> 02:59.647
You and your boss.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.914
Raina Punjabi only

03:00.948 --> 03:03.417
got this feminazi game
made by being a slut.

03:03.451 --> 03:05.118
Really? Like I've never heard
that before?

03:05.152 --> 03:07.555
You're one of those?
Get out of here.

03:07.588 --> 03:08.956
You want to kiss me?

03:08.989 --> 03:11.859
Are we gonna kiss?

03:11.892 --> 03:13.994
Get out of here.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.062
I'm super scared.

03:15.095 --> 03:17.265
Did your mom
give you that hat?

03:17.265 --> 03:19.833
Bye, have a nice day.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.635
[cheering]

03:21.669 --> 03:24.538
Yeah, baby. Your ass is grass.
Take that, bitch.

03:24.572 --> 03:27.107
It's like overgrown boys,

03:27.140 --> 03:28.776
like, staring at a screen
pressing buttons.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.511
Isn't there a basketball
game on or something?

03:30.544 --> 03:33.947
You seen the Knicks lately?
[chuckles]

03:33.981 --> 03:38.719
Oh, hold up, there's that nanny,
the, Leslie Connolly.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.053
He's the one that
babysat for the kids.

03:40.087 --> 03:42.155
The two girls who stabbed
their little sister.

03:42.189 --> 03:45.926
Okay, he's the guy that drove
all those Glasgow Man pictures?

03:45.959 --> 03:47.928
He's turning it into
a video game now?

03:47.961 --> 03:49.563
Hey, Leslie? Hey.

03:49.597 --> 03:50.731
A little too soon, isn't it?

03:50.764 --> 03:52.966
Detectives.
What can I say?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.568
Trial created a lot of buzz.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.036
Yeah, you're taking
full advantage.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.838
Well, the developers
came to me.

03:57.871 --> 04:01.309
They were gonna
make it either way.

04:01.309 --> 04:03.176
Want to give it a try?

04:03.210 --> 04:04.645
Virtual reality.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.079
Virtual reality?

04:06.113 --> 04:09.917
It's like you're actually
inside of the game.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.118
I'm good.

04:11.151 --> 04:12.353
Will you just watch the booth
for a second?

04:12.386 --> 04:14.355
I'll be right back

04:24.998 --> 04:26.867
[gasps]
Get out.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.001
You get out.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.903
- We don't want you here.
- Oh, no!

04:29.937 --> 04:31.572
(male announcer)
Here we see Murdersaurus.

04:31.605 --> 04:34.942
Murdersaurus performing
some long distance dentistry.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.176
He's down to a sidearm.

04:36.209 --> 04:38.412
As we see, Quickfire
is currently in the lead,

04:38.446 --> 04:40.180
but Lightning Bolts
are catching up pretty fast.

04:40.213 --> 04:41.415
You guys fans
of Lightning Bolt's?

04:41.449 --> 04:43.817
[all]
Yeah.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.118
Amazonian Warrior, huh?

04:45.152 --> 04:46.520
Is it true that you
only have one breast?

04:46.554 --> 04:47.588
Stop! Stop!
Stop!

04:47.621 --> 04:48.989
I got that kiss for you.
You want a kiss.

04:49.022 --> 04:51.525
And it looks like Team
Probie's got Team Quickfire .

04:51.559 --> 04:52.626
Can we give them a chant?

04:52.660 --> 04:53.994
Yeah.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.228
Let's give him a chant.

04:55.262 --> 04:59.166
Kill them. Kill them.
Kill them.

04:59.199 --> 05:00.768
[screams]

05:00.801 --> 05:04.772
- Kill them. Kill them.
- Ahhhh! Ahhhh! Nooo.

05:07.174 --> 05:09.377
[cheering]

05:09.410 --> 05:11.379
(announcer)
And he just dropped the bomb!

05:11.379 --> 05:14.047
He dropped the bomb!
That's the last time.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.583
He's never coming back.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.217
I don't know. I mean,
have you seen anyone do that?

05:17.250 --> 05:18.752
Detectives, my co-worker
thinks that someone's in trouble

05:18.786 --> 05:19.820
in the ladies room.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.855
(Carisi)
Ohh!

05:21.889 --> 05:24.392
Don't worry about it, guys.
I got this.

05:24.392 --> 05:28.662
[cheering]

05:33.100 --> 05:34.702
Hey, you okay?

05:34.735 --> 05:36.604
Yeah, I'm fine.

05:36.637 --> 05:38.972
Okay, 'cause I'm
a police officer.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.974
- What happened?
- These guys.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.977
They just can't stand women
in gaming.

05:46.113 --> 05:49.450
What did they do to you?

05:49.483 --> 05:52.453
The leveled up.

05:57.324 --> 06:00.428
[dramatic music]

06:00.428 --> 06:08.436
*

06:11.439 --> 06:19.447
*

06:22.450 --> 06:30.458
*

06:33.461 --> 06:41.469
*

06:44.472 --> 06:44.672
.

06:44.705 --> 06:45.839
Okay, this girl--

06:45.873 --> 06:47.541
Sarah Keller, 22.

06:47.575 --> 06:50.143
(Fin)
She works for Raina Punjabi,
the game developer.

06:50.177 --> 06:52.580
Okay, and this girl
was attacked at, the what again?

06:52.613 --> 06:54.515
The I.V.L. finals.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.349
The International Video
Game League.

06:56.383 --> 06:58.318
It's like March Madness,
but for video games.

06:58.351 --> 07:00.521
I go every year. Nothing
like this has ever happened.

07:00.554 --> 07:03.056
But Sarah told me that
the guys who did this

07:03.090 --> 07:04.858
don't like women in gaming.

07:04.892 --> 07:07.861
Well, in their world,
a developer's like God,

07:07.895 --> 07:10.263
and some guys aren't ready
to give a girl that power.

07:10.297 --> 07:11.665
Okay, does Sarah
know her attacker?

07:11.699 --> 07:12.966
No, well, maybe.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.368
Carisi stayed behind to cull
the security footage.

07:15.402 --> 07:20.508
Hold on, you got Rollins
and Carisi on this on a Sunday?

07:20.508 --> 07:21.909
Never mind.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.344
Okay, I'm not gonna
understand a word that anybody

07:24.377 --> 07:25.879
is saying about this,
so, Fin,

07:25.913 --> 07:27.615
why don't you come with me
to interview Sarah,

07:27.648 --> 07:28.816
and Rollins,

07:28.849 --> 07:31.819
why don't you follow up
with Carisi at the,

07:31.852 --> 07:33.621
whatever it is.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.288
Yeah, so there were
two of them.

07:35.322 --> 07:38.992
They were, like,
total F.A.L.s.

07:39.026 --> 07:40.594
Failures at life.

07:40.628 --> 07:44.832
Yeah, they were, like, young,
they were white but pale,

07:44.865 --> 07:46.133
like, kind of skinny.

07:46.166 --> 07:49.236
That's 80 percent
of the crowd.

07:49.269 --> 07:51.805
Okay, Sarah, so what
did they do to you?

07:51.839 --> 07:54.875
Um. They touched
my breasts, kind of.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.143
They, like,
pushed me down.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.111
I don't know,
I fought them of and they ran.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.714
You told Detective Rollins
that this was personal,

08:00.748 --> 08:02.349
- so you knew them.
- Oh, no, no.

08:02.382 --> 08:03.684
I didn't know
them personally,

08:03.717 --> 08:05.285
they'd just been by the booth
a couple of times.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.154
They were talking smack
about my boss, Raina,

08:07.187 --> 08:11.659
because her game's not popular
with K.O.B.S. addicts.

08:11.692 --> 08:14.127
- K.O.B.S.?
- Kill or Be Slaughtered.

08:14.161 --> 08:17.064
It's just another carbon
copy FPS with new skins

08:17.097 --> 08:18.966
but the same
ten-year-old engine.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.133
First person shooter.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.669
A shoot-'em-up game.

08:21.702 --> 08:24.004
Guys who play it
hate games like Raina's.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.839
- And why is that?
- Amazonian Warriors

08:25.873 --> 08:31.579
is nonviolent and
nonstupid, so just,

08:31.579 --> 08:34.414
like, the opposite
of a K.O.B.S. addict.

08:34.447 --> 08:35.783
Anyway, we launch
on Tuesday.

08:35.816 --> 08:39.452
They've been getting
kind of crazy online.

08:39.486 --> 08:41.321
Hey, Sarge, you guys
got a sec?

08:41.354 --> 08:42.322
Excuse us.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.458
Yeah, okay.

08:45.492 --> 08:46.660
This security footage,

08:46.694 --> 08:49.062
it's like trying to find a geek
in a geek stack.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.364
Yeah, we got two suspects
coming out of the ladies room.

08:51.398 --> 08:54.234
One's wearing a baseball cap,
the other's wearing a hoodie.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.203
We only got partial views
of their faces.

08:56.236 --> 08:57.905
Well, you buy tickets
to this on a computer, right?

08:57.938 --> 08:59.439
Yeah, we're running
the buyers' names

08:59.472 --> 09:01.108
against the Sex Offenders
Registry right now.

09:01.141 --> 09:02.776
(Fin)
That's not what this is.

09:02.810 --> 09:05.679
These guys want Raina Punjabi
out of the gaming world.

09:05.713 --> 09:07.114
Just because
she's a woman?

09:07.147 --> 09:08.348
There's a lot of
haters out there

09:08.381 --> 09:10.383
that think she slept her
way into the business.

09:10.417 --> 09:12.219
Oh, right, right,
she's engaged to that venture

09:12.252 --> 09:13.353
capitalist, Steven Kaplan.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.856
Okay, so because
her fiancé has money,

09:15.889 --> 09:17.357
that means she
has no talent?

09:17.390 --> 09:21.128
To them, and they want
to take her down no matter what.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.063
Then why attack Sarah?

09:23.096 --> 09:25.032
Why not just go after Raina?

09:29.169 --> 09:30.771
(Raina)
Sarah told me
she fought them off.

09:30.804 --> 09:33.874
I put a reward on my website for
anyone who catches these creeps.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.676
She also tell you
these creeps have a grudge

09:35.709 --> 09:37.177
against you and your game?

09:37.210 --> 09:39.046
There's nothing in the game
for them to be angry about.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.547
You can choose how you play.

09:40.648 --> 09:41.849
You can wage peace or war.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.717
Have a patriarchy
or a matriarchy.

09:43.751 --> 09:45.418
Be eco conscious
or industrialized.

09:45.452 --> 09:48.889
I know. I read on Kotaku
that it's better the Civ 5

09:48.922 --> 09:51.224
with the "Brave New World"
expansion pack.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.393
Okay, well, they guys
that attacked Sarah weren't

09:53.426 --> 09:55.195
as evolved as my partner.

09:55.228 --> 09:58.198
Now look, anyone look familiar?

10:02.870 --> 10:04.004
They all look familiar.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.372
That's the gaming demo.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.140
Unfortunately, there's always
a few haters in the mix.

10:07.174 --> 10:08.475
Anything specific?

10:08.508 --> 10:09.810
Email threats,

10:09.843 --> 10:11.945
posts to your websites
or other gamer sites?

10:11.979 --> 10:13.313
- Hacker attacks?
- All the time,

10:13.346 --> 10:15.148
but I can't be bothered
with that right now.

10:15.182 --> 10:17.250
I block it all out.
We launch in two days.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.986
Raina, everything all right?

10:19.019 --> 10:20.587
Yeah, these detectives
are here about Sarah.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.355
This is my fiancé.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.024
Steven Kaplan.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.926
- Sarah's okay, right?
- Yeah.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.227
We wanted to give her
the week off,

10:27.260 --> 10:28.962
but it's too
important a time.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.998
It is, and Sarah doesn't
want to miss any of it.

10:31.031 --> 10:34.067
So you're not just
an investor, you work here.

10:34.101 --> 10:35.468
We're a team.

10:35.502 --> 10:38.338
That's cool, but you did have
an employee attacked.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.107
And we take that seriously.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.709
Our internal security's
working on it.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.977
Okay, we're gonna need them
to give us any specifics

10:44.011 --> 10:45.345
from the past few weeks.

10:45.378 --> 10:47.314
Steven, I just don't have
time for this right now.

10:47.347 --> 10:50.350
Raina, I've got this.
I'm sorry.

10:50.383 --> 10:51.752
She's really under the gun.

10:51.785 --> 10:54.287
This launch is
a career changer.

10:54.321 --> 10:57.390
We'll give you what we have.

10:57.424 --> 10:58.926
[knocks on door]
(Carisi) Hey, Sarge.

10:58.959 --> 11:01.729
The Fedarales are working with
Raina Punjabi's security team.

11:01.729 --> 11:02.963
But not with Raina.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.065
Oh, no. this
Amazonian Warriors rollout,

11:05.098 --> 11:06.734
it's just like opening
night of a movie.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.235
I've been reading
articles online.

11:08.268 --> 11:11.438
I've got to tell you, I mean,
is this Noah's future,

11:11.471 --> 11:14.742
adolescent boys playing
cyborg cowboys and Indians?

11:14.742 --> 11:16.309
Don't tell Fin that.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.411
Kill or Be Slaughtered is like
a spiritual experience for him.

11:18.445 --> 11:19.913
Yeah, well,
I don't get it.

11:19.947 --> 11:21.248
Well, you might not
get this either.

11:21.281 --> 11:23.751
Leslie Connolly,
that Glasgow Man guy,

11:23.751 --> 11:25.986
he might have
something for us.

11:26.019 --> 11:29.222
After the tournament I wanted
some feedback on Glasgow Man,

11:29.256 --> 11:31.124
so I checked a few gamer
sites online.

11:31.158 --> 11:32.659
Forums for players
to rate games,

11:32.760 --> 11:33.961
comment, fulminate, spew--

11:33.994 --> 11:36.329
Yeah, I got that,
Carisi. And?

11:36.363 --> 11:38.899
Peep this thread.

11:38.932 --> 11:43.036
"Amazonian Warriors bitch
got what she deserved." Lovely

11:43.070 --> 11:44.671
- Mm-hmm.
- A lot of crap like that.

11:44.772 --> 11:47.274
Guys puffing their e-chests out,
high fiving.

11:47.307 --> 11:48.575
- It could be anybody.
- Hold on.

11:48.608 --> 11:51.544
Give me a second.

11:51.578 --> 11:53.380
D.M. me for more deets
on what an

11:53.413 --> 11:55.115
Amazonian Warrior's
tits are like.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.384
My boy and I copped a feel
at the I.V.L.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.052
That could be one of our guys.
Did you D.M. him?

11:59.086 --> 12:00.120
I don't want to talk
to that guy,

12:00.153 --> 12:01.588
that's why I came to you.

12:01.621 --> 12:03.523
So I'm guessing that
this message is untraceable.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.192
That's why we got to go
with Leslie here.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.227
They know you.
They trust you.

12:07.260 --> 12:08.228
Which is why I'm
deputizing you

12:08.261 --> 12:10.330
an official C.I.
of the NYPD

12:10.363 --> 12:13.333
What? I don't want these guys
knowing that I ratted them out.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.035
These guys are criminals,

12:15.068 --> 12:16.536
and if you don't
cooperate with us,

12:16.569 --> 12:19.807
we're gonna shut your game down
and invoke the Son of Sam Law.

12:19.807 --> 12:21.809
You can't make a profit
from a crime.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.844
So let's get those deets
from your buddy.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.678
Tell them that you were
in the booth next to that girl.

12:25.712 --> 12:27.948
That she was a complete bitch.

12:27.981 --> 12:30.951
Okay, here goes.

12:33.887 --> 12:35.288
- Now what.
- Tell them that you doxxed

12:35.322 --> 12:37.024
the girl that was sharing
the booth with her.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.926
Doxxing's when you publish
personal information,

12:38.959 --> 12:40.627
phone numbers,
passwords, online.

12:40.660 --> 12:43.230
See if he wants to hook up,
talk about pranking her.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.697
Tell him that you'll meet
him there with a buddy.

12:44.731 --> 12:46.499
That'll be me.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.501
I got that too, Carisi.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.105
Do I really need to be here?

12:52.139 --> 12:53.673
Leslie, chill out.

12:53.706 --> 12:54.707
Chill out?

12:54.741 --> 12:56.910
Seriously?

12:56.944 --> 12:58.879
Hey, Leslie.

12:58.912 --> 13:01.348
Oh, what up?

13:01.381 --> 13:04.117
This is my programmer,
Carisi.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.019
Call me Sonny,
everybody does.

13:06.053 --> 13:08.121
So you doxxed
that other bitch?

13:08.155 --> 13:09.256
I didn't see
anything online.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.590
Well, I'll send you a link,

13:10.623 --> 13:12.860
but tell me, did that
gamer slut, did she cry?

13:12.860 --> 13:14.194
She was a whiney
little bitch, man.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.496
It's like, hello, what did you
expect setting up a both

13:16.529 --> 13:17.664
at a K.O.B.S. event,
am I right?

13:17.697 --> 13:19.399
Yep. Won't make that mistake
again.

13:19.432 --> 13:20.733
Yeah.

13:20.767 --> 13:24.938
But look, I want those deets.
Now, you promised me.

13:24.972 --> 13:26.473
They were a pretty
nice handful.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.876
They were kind of small,
but nice and perky.

13:28.876 --> 13:32.312
Sweet. Sweet.
You got any, [whistles]

13:32.345 --> 13:33.981
You know? He knows.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.683
She got the message,
all right? We good?

13:36.716 --> 13:38.685
Oh, yeah, man,
we're real good.

13:38.718 --> 13:40.954
Oh, by the way,
you're under arrest.

13:40.988 --> 13:41.955
What?

13:43.891 --> 13:44.925
Wrong move, player.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.626
No, we were just kidding
with that girl.

13:46.659 --> 13:47.895
Nice try.

13:47.895 --> 13:50.063
No reset button
in the real world.

13:57.070 --> 13:59.372
Okay, Sarah, do you
recognize anybody?

13:59.406 --> 14:01.074
Yeah, number three.

14:01.108 --> 14:02.409
He groped me.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.377
[knocks on window]

14:04.411 --> 14:06.379
Okay, next window.

14:09.716 --> 14:12.485
Anyone here?

14:12.519 --> 14:15.923
Yeah, that slope-browed
son of a bitch, number 2.

14:15.923 --> 14:16.924
Great.

14:16.924 --> 14:18.491
[knocks on window]

14:18.525 --> 14:20.293
Have fun with that,
counselor.

14:20.327 --> 14:23.063
Great job, Sarah. We're gonna
be able to charge them,

14:23.096 --> 14:24.364
and the D.A.'ll be in touch.

14:24.397 --> 14:27.534
Oh, but we'll be able
to keep it quiet, right?

14:27.567 --> 14:28.936
It's this big launch
on Tuesday,

14:28.969 --> 14:30.037
and if anything
interferes with that,

14:30.070 --> 14:33.941
Raina will,
like, kill me.

14:33.941 --> 14:35.943
Okay.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.947
(Benson)
The arrest went viral.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.548
This is what Sarah
was afraid of.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.683
These comments, they're
some pretty vicious stuff.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.119
(Rollins)
"Nice work, Gary and Zack,
taking one for the team.

14:46.153 --> 14:47.554
Hope they gave it
to her real good"

14:47.587 --> 14:49.256
They're treating
the guys like heroes.

14:49.289 --> 14:51.724
They're not.

14:51.758 --> 14:53.726
(Carisi)
Look at this video.
This guy's got a ton of hits.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.197
(computerized voice)
Gary and Zack
are sacrificial lambs

14:57.230 --> 15:00.500
crucified on the altar
of political correctness.

15:00.533 --> 15:03.870
That slut Sarah
got off easily.

15:03.971 --> 15:07.640
Do not go where you're
not wanted, bitches.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.376
I hope we didn't just give
the haters a recruiting tool.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.178
Guys, unless there's
a specific threat,

15:11.211 --> 15:12.980
there's nothing
we can do about it.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.353
So you spend all day
with a gun in your holster

15:20.387 --> 15:22.022
and you still go home
and play, like,

15:22.055 --> 15:23.556
shoot-'em-up games
after work.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.158
Sometimes all night.

15:25.192 --> 15:26.859
What am I missing here?

15:26.893 --> 15:29.196
See, at work I got
1 P.P., I got Barba,

15:29.229 --> 15:30.597
they get in my way.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.199
At home it's just me
and my clan. It's simple.

15:32.232 --> 15:33.366
No gray.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.235
Just shoot the other team.

15:35.268 --> 15:36.336
Go get the bad guy.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.671
All right.

15:38.705 --> 15:40.340
Are you so addicted
that you have to play

15:40.373 --> 15:41.541
right at this second?

15:41.574 --> 15:43.210
Come on, Fin,
not at the dinner table.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.745
I'm sorry, I just found
a live stream of Raina.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.680
She's being interviewed.

15:47.714 --> 15:50.417
So Raina,
people are commenting.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.019
I'm gonna read one for you.

15:52.019 --> 15:53.386
"There'd be no game

15:53.420 --> 15:56.456
if Miss Punjabi hadn't
banged the money man."

15:56.489 --> 15:58.225
Steven and I
are getting married.

15:58.258 --> 16:01.294
So you'd agree that
the criticisms of your work

16:01.328 --> 16:03.030
are rooted in misogyny?

16:03.063 --> 16:04.297
This guy's supposed
to be on our side,

16:04.331 --> 16:05.598
and he's still
giving her a hard time.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.600
Jack, you're roping me
into a feminist debate.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.302
I'm here to discuss
my game.

16:09.336 --> 16:10.937
- NYPD!
- On the ground!

16:11.038 --> 16:12.039
[Raina screams]
- Get on the ground!

16:12.039 --> 16:13.473
(interviewer)
Raina? Everything okay?

16:13.506 --> 16:14.474
(police officer)
Let's go.

16:14.507 --> 16:15.608
[screams]

16:15.642 --> 16:18.411
Get down!
Hands on your head.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.947
What's going on?

16:21.048 --> 16:22.115
What's happening?

16:22.149 --> 16:23.116
(police officer)
Secure that.

16:23.150 --> 16:27.520
(interviewer)
Raina?

16:27.554 --> 16:29.522
Raina, are you okay?

16:34.427 --> 16:34.627
.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.197
You got three 911 calls
from three different phones,

16:37.230 --> 16:39.232
all saying there was
a hostage crisis here.

16:39.266 --> 16:40.433
Yeah, kids, weapons.

16:40.467 --> 16:41.568
Did you trace
the numbers yet?

16:41.601 --> 16:43.670
Let me guess.
Pay phone.

16:43.703 --> 16:44.871
Internet phones.

16:44.904 --> 16:46.673
You played right
into their hoax.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.709
Randy got SWATed.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.911
These got a hundred ways
to handle this situation.

16:51.944 --> 16:54.247
They always use one,
bang down the damn doors.

16:54.281 --> 16:55.882
They're just doing
their job, Fin.

16:55.915 --> 16:58.285
- You okay?
- Hold on, Steven. I'm fine.

16:58.318 --> 16:59.886
Steven's just stuck outside.

16:59.919 --> 17:01.888
Hey, can we get
the fiancé up?

17:01.921 --> 17:04.124
I'm not shocked by this.
That's what these guys do.

17:04.157 --> 17:05.958
They troll
behind their computers

17:05.992 --> 17:07.094
and make prank calls.

17:07.127 --> 17:09.329
This was more
than a prank call.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.863
You could have been
seriously hurt.

17:10.897 --> 17:12.765
They're just trying
to humiliate me,

17:12.799 --> 17:14.267
and they got
what they wanted.

17:14.301 --> 17:15.702
Anonymous cowards.

17:15.735 --> 17:17.837
- Raina, are you all right?
- Everything is fine, Steven.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.939
They just SWATed me
in the middle of the interview.

17:19.972 --> 17:21.508
Yeah, I saw.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.176
Good for them,
it's over now.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.112
Stop saying that.

17:25.112 --> 17:26.479
Do they know?

17:26.513 --> 17:28.281
Do we know about what?

17:28.315 --> 17:30.217
- Tell them or I will.
- Steven, stop.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.718
They sent her
a threatening message

17:31.751 --> 17:34.154
earlier today saying they
want to see her on her knees

17:34.187 --> 17:35.455
in front of the whole world,

17:35.488 --> 17:37.124
and she got
doxxed an hour ago.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.158
That's how they knew
this address.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.559
And where was that posted?

17:39.592 --> 17:43.696
A sub thread on Red Channet,
tracking Raina, it's vile.

17:43.730 --> 17:44.997
I told you not to read it.

17:45.031 --> 17:46.933
I knew you'd overreact.

17:46.966 --> 17:48.701
So I got doxxed.
I'll move.

17:48.735 --> 17:49.936
I'll change my passwords,
my number-

17:49.969 --> 17:51.438
Raina, do you understand
what's going on?

17:51.471 --> 17:53.240
- This is serious.
- Yes.

17:53.273 --> 17:54.874
The game is being
launched tomorrow at noon.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.976
That is the only thing
that is going on.

17:57.009 --> 18:00.480
Everything else is noise.

18:00.513 --> 18:01.881
Okay, that sub thread,

18:01.914 --> 18:04.384
I'm gonna need the link
and the threatening message.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.253
And if she doesn't
come with us, you are.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.388
I'll talk to her.

18:08.421 --> 18:09.956
Okay, Raina got doxxed,

18:09.989 --> 18:12.159
her personal info published,
I get that,

18:12.192 --> 18:13.526
but SWATed?
Help me out here.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.896
It's an anonymous call
to 911 sending the SWAT team

18:16.929 --> 18:19.599
to your home.
These guys play dirty.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.168
Even so, how is
this SVU related?

18:21.168 --> 18:23.170
Wait till you
see these threats.

18:23.170 --> 18:24.804
Sarge, this is Raina Punjabi

18:24.837 --> 18:26.973
and her fiancé and business
partner, Steven Kaplan.

18:27.006 --> 18:28.641
Okay.
Thank you for coming in.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.343
I didn't exactly
have a choice.

18:30.377 --> 18:32.645
I understand some serious
threats have been made.

18:32.679 --> 18:34.681
They hacked your
company's website?

18:34.714 --> 18:36.583
We're back online.

18:36.616 --> 18:37.917
- Anything specific?
- Yeah.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.852
They're threatening
violence against Raina

18:39.886 --> 18:44.056
and her female employees.

18:44.090 --> 18:47.059
"Fair warning.
If Raina Punjabi dares

18:47.093 --> 18:49.462
"to go through
with the launch tomorrow,

18:49.496 --> 18:52.965
"we'll make sure that
her raped and mutilated corpse

18:52.999 --> 18:54.234
"is on the front page

18:54.267 --> 18:56.436
of every feminist blog
by next week."

18:56.469 --> 18:59.206
That's a specific threat,
not protected by free speech.

18:59.206 --> 19:02.609
(Rollins)
And here's another one
of his threats,

19:02.642 --> 19:03.843
(computerized voice)
That slut, Raina, deserves

19:03.876 --> 19:06.846
all the pain
that's coming to her.

19:06.879 --> 19:10.950
Her game is derivative,
mind numbing garbage.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.018
She's a whore.

19:12.051 --> 19:14.821
She used sex
to get where she is,

19:14.854 --> 19:16.956
and if she
and her social justice warriors

19:16.989 --> 19:19.592
don't leave gaming now,

19:19.626 --> 19:22.729
we will make them.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.764
(Rollins)
And there are dozens
of others like this.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.466
Threatening rape.
Threatening attacks

19:26.499 --> 19:28.034
during the launch
at the Birch Pavilion.

19:28.067 --> 19:29.702
And we can't trace
where these are coming from?

19:29.736 --> 19:31.238
(Fin)
They upload it
through the dark net

19:31.238 --> 19:32.972
just like the doxxing,
so no.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.607
Okay.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.509
And the launch is
scheduled for tomorrow?

19:36.543 --> 19:37.544
At noon.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.712
So would you consider
postponing?

19:39.746 --> 19:42.649
This isn't a little lecture
I invited my friends to.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.785
It is the launch event of
an international game rollout.

19:45.818 --> 19:48.255
It's being live streamed
in 18 countries.

19:48.288 --> 19:49.922
Every major gaming site
is sending a rep.

19:49.956 --> 19:53.159
Yeah, I understand that, but
these are public death threats.

19:53.260 --> 19:55.428
All the more reason
why we can't postpone.

19:55.462 --> 19:57.129
Ever since the SWATing
went viral,

19:57.163 --> 19:59.499
I'm being called the face
of women in gaming.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.067
Tomorrow I'm doing
an interview on CNBC.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.635
Then I'm ringing
the opening NASDAQ bell.

20:02.669 --> 20:04.136
(Fin)
I mean,
you can do all that,

20:04.170 --> 20:07.874
but the launch itself, can't you
tape it and stream it later.

20:07.907 --> 20:10.810
If we do that, they've won.

20:10.843 --> 20:14.347
I'm showing the world that I'm
intimidated by cyber terrorists.

20:14.381 --> 20:15.848
I won't make the same
mistake Sony did.

20:15.882 --> 20:18.217
It's better to be called
a bitch than a coward.

20:18.251 --> 20:20.420
(Steve)
Raina.

20:20.453 --> 20:25.758
Look, I came down here,
I'm cooperating,

20:25.792 --> 20:28.261
and I appreciate
that you have a job to do.

20:28.295 --> 20:31.598
So just so we're clear,
you have officially warned me.

20:31.631 --> 20:33.766
I accept all liability.

20:33.800 --> 20:37.870
But I absolutely do not want
a visible police presence.

20:37.904 --> 20:41.941
No E.S.U., no bomb
sniffing dogs.

20:41.974 --> 20:45.077
Please.

20:45.111 --> 20:47.079
I have to go home
and get some sleep.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.686
Thank you, detectives.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.455
She's serious about
her work, I get it.

20:55.488 --> 20:58.491
She doesn't want
to be compromised.

20:58.525 --> 20:59.859
How many people are going
to this thing tomorrow?

20:59.892 --> 21:01.328
At least 500.

21:01.328 --> 21:02.962
Raina may not be worried
about herself,

21:02.995 --> 21:05.064
but all the people
in the audience?

21:05.097 --> 21:06.933
Yeah, we can't let
this thing happen.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.501
I've got some friends
at FDNY, I'm sure they

21:08.535 --> 21:10.937
could find some violations,
shut the Birch Pavilion down.

21:10.970 --> 21:13.139
Raina's right, we do that,

21:13.172 --> 21:16.443
the cyber terrorists win.

21:16.476 --> 21:18.911
Guys, we have the resources
to keep a low key presence.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.847
Call the Birch Pavilion
and coordinate it.

21:31.424 --> 21:32.759
Anything on the pre-screen?

21:32.792 --> 21:34.361
Nobody who bought a ticket
with a credit card matches

21:34.361 --> 21:36.963
any of the online profiles
we managed to trace.

21:36.996 --> 21:38.498
It's a waste of time.

21:38.531 --> 21:40.933
Anyone up to no good
is not using a credit card.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.370
Okay, so let's focus
on what we can do. Spread out.

21:43.403 --> 21:44.804
Watch hands and eyes.

21:44.837 --> 21:47.507
Stay on the radio.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.275
Carisi, what's it looking like?

21:49.376 --> 21:52.011
We got a bunch of monitors
with grainy footage.

21:52.044 --> 21:54.381
You guys ever think about
upgrading your security systems?

21:54.414 --> 21:56.115
Who are you, Steven Spielberg?

21:56.148 --> 21:57.750
We're here as a courtesy.

21:57.784 --> 21:59.586
Come on. We got the
situation under control.

21:59.619 --> 22:02.422
200 events a year in this place,
we haven't lost anybody yet.

22:02.455 --> 22:04.624
Well, let's not break
that streak.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.639
(woman)
Hunt.

22:19.672 --> 22:20.773
Build.

22:20.807 --> 22:22.108
Forage.

22:22.141 --> 22:23.242
Create.

22:23.275 --> 22:27.447
They say history repeats itself,

22:27.480 --> 22:32.919
but now it's up to you
to get it right.

22:32.952 --> 22:37.189
Find the Amazonian Warrior
in you.

22:37.223 --> 22:41.594
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome to the stage,

22:41.628 --> 22:43.963
Raina Punjabi.

22:43.996 --> 22:49.969
[cheers and applause]

22:50.002 --> 22:51.137
Good afternoon.

22:51.170 --> 22:53.440
I am Raina Punjabi.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.575
[cheers and applause]

22:55.608 --> 22:58.845
I'm guessing most
of you already knew that.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.647
Thank you for coming.

23:00.680 --> 23:04.451
I am very excited
to share Amazonian Warriors

23:04.484 --> 23:06.453
with all of you here today

23:06.453 --> 23:09.489
and with all of you
streaming this online.

23:09.522 --> 23:11.524
Nearly two years in the making,

23:11.558 --> 23:14.260
this civilization
building strategy game

23:14.293 --> 23:18.197
allows you to control a land
of your own creation.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.633
The goal,
to get it right this time.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.969
- Yeah.

23:23.002 --> 23:27.474
- What's that?
- Raina, get down.

23:27.507 --> 23:30.677
Guys,
where are those coming from?

23:30.710 --> 23:34.213
How can we change the mistakes
of our past

23:34.246 --> 23:35.482
to create a more perfect world?

23:35.482 --> 23:38.485
(Fin)
Laser pointer. Row five,
left side.

23:38.485 --> 23:39.819
Hey.

23:39.852 --> 23:41.253
Hey, you can't do that.

23:41.287 --> 23:42.989
(Rollins)
Watch me. Come on.

23:43.022 --> 23:45.892
- The game is collaborative,
team building,

23:45.925 --> 23:50.162
encouraging cooperation
and group problem solving.

23:50.196 --> 23:51.230
Three more.

23:51.263 --> 23:53.099
I see. Copy that.

23:53.132 --> 23:54.967
NYPD, you want
to hand me that?

23:55.001 --> 23:57.103
- I didn't know it was on.
- I'm sure you didn't.

23:57.136 --> 23:59.839
Let's go, you're out.
You too.

23:59.872 --> 24:02.341
You're out of here as well.

24:02.374 --> 24:04.276
- Wow, laser pointers.

24:04.310 --> 24:07.146
You know,
my mom's cat loves those.

24:07.179 --> 24:09.749
As I was saying,
the game is collaborative,

24:09.782 --> 24:13.219
offering multiple points of view
so that the player is--

24:13.252 --> 24:15.688
[screams and loud banging]

24:15.722 --> 24:18.958
(voice of speaker)
Bitches will die.

24:18.991 --> 24:23.095
No social justice in gaming.

24:23.129 --> 24:25.532
Now, you all
will be destroyed.

24:25.565 --> 24:26.966
Carisi, what are you seeing?

24:26.999 --> 24:28.535
Someone hacked into
the lighting board.

24:28.535 --> 24:29.869
The security system too.

24:29.902 --> 24:31.337
Tell me you got an override.
Come on, let's go.

24:31.370 --> 24:32.672
Come on, move over.

24:32.705 --> 24:33.940
Be calm. Be calm. Be calm.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.842
Police.
Remain calm.

24:35.875 --> 24:38.444
Raina? Raina?

24:38.545 --> 24:40.312
- Raina?
- Who's got eyes on Raina?

24:40.346 --> 24:44.350
Who's got eyes?

24:44.383 --> 24:47.353
We lost her.

24:56.563 --> 24:56.696
.

24:56.729 --> 24:57.830
Where's our principle?

24:57.864 --> 24:59.165
I got nothing.

24:59.198 --> 25:01.000
- Miss Punjabi, this way.
- Hey, hey. What happened?

25:01.033 --> 25:02.334
- Her mic's still on.
- Where are we going?

25:02.368 --> 25:04.103
- Carisi, anything?
- I got her. I got her.

25:04.136 --> 25:06.573
She's with a security guard
in the back hallway.

25:06.573 --> 25:08.240
[screaming]

25:08.274 --> 25:10.176
- Hey, let go of me.
- Back exit.

25:10.209 --> 25:12.011
Back exit.

25:22.088 --> 25:23.856
(Carisi)
Police, stop!

25:30.129 --> 25:33.332
Get up. Come on.

25:33.365 --> 25:34.601
Hey.

25:34.601 --> 25:36.736
- He had Raina.
- I was trying to help her.

25:36.769 --> 25:38.605
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

25:38.605 --> 25:39.839
Wrong answer.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.473
Detective, she's up there.

25:41.507 --> 25:42.909
Shut up, bitch.

25:42.942 --> 25:45.477
Keep your mouth shut,
or you're done.

25:45.511 --> 25:47.513
Do you hear me?

25:47.614 --> 25:49.415
Game on, NYPD.

25:49.448 --> 25:51.784
Where's that coming from.

25:51.818 --> 25:54.721
Track it, Rollins.
Track it now.

25:54.754 --> 25:56.989
- What, this wasn't my idea.
- Do you think that matters?

25:57.023 --> 25:58.290
You're an accomplice
to kidnapping.

25:58.324 --> 25:59.759
He said we were just
gonna grief her.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.193
Smoke bombs.
Laser pointers.

26:01.227 --> 26:02.895
- Things like that.
- And the kidnapping.

26:02.929 --> 26:04.063
No one told me about that.

26:04.096 --> 26:06.198
Does no one have a name?

26:06.232 --> 26:08.300
A user name, Acid Rain,

26:08.334 --> 26:11.270
- but I've never met him.
- What did he say exactly?

26:11.303 --> 26:13.005
He said to bring Raina
out the back exit.

26:13.039 --> 26:14.140
What, so they left you here?

26:14.173 --> 26:15.341
They threw her in a van?
What?

26:15.374 --> 26:16.643
I didn't know that
they were gonna--

26:16.643 --> 26:18.310
- What are you a patsy?
- Yeah, God forbid something

26:18.344 --> 26:20.980
happens to Raina, you'll be
looking at murder charges.

26:21.013 --> 26:24.651
If you know something,
say something right now.

26:24.651 --> 26:26.886
I saw the van.
It was white.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.188
License number.

26:29.221 --> 26:32.291
Now, NYPD detectives
were aware of possible threats

26:32.324 --> 26:34.126
and were inside
the Birch Pavilion

26:34.160 --> 26:37.463
at the time of the kidnapping
but were unable--

26:37.496 --> 26:38.731
That was the commissioner.

26:38.765 --> 26:40.266
Tell me something's popped
on this white van.

26:40.299 --> 26:42.234
It was stolen from a garage
yesterday.

26:42.268 --> 26:44.270
Security cameras
there were blacked out.

26:44.303 --> 26:46.538
The license plate went out
right after the kidnapping,

26:46.572 --> 26:48.675
and Port Authority cameras
haven't seen it at any bridges

26:48.675 --> 26:50.276
- or tunnels.
- So it's still in Manhattan.

26:50.309 --> 26:51.711
What about a phone,
are we tracking it?

26:51.744 --> 26:53.545
No luck. They must have
removed the battery.

26:53.579 --> 26:56.482
I got a tip. White cargo van
at an abandoned factory.

26:56.515 --> 26:57.984
Plates match.
Uni's are on the way.

26:58.017 --> 26:59.518
You two, go.

27:12.598 --> 27:15.267
Open.

27:15.301 --> 27:17.269
(police officer)
Clear.

27:18.905 --> 27:20.707
All right,
let's get C.S.U. in here.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.709
Let's comb the interior.

27:27.513 --> 27:29.315
Amanda.

27:55.241 --> 27:57.109
Look at this.
Here we go.

27:57.143 --> 27:58.978
That's from
Kill or Be Slaughtered.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.013
That's a cyborg logo.

28:01.047 --> 28:02.548
They left that for us.

28:02.581 --> 28:04.316
All right, we need
C.S.U. down here too.

28:04.350 --> 28:05.417
We got something.

28:05.451 --> 28:06.753
I mean that's her blouse.

28:06.753 --> 28:08.487
And that's blood.

28:15.194 --> 28:17.163
They left us a video.

28:19.298 --> 28:24.771
Please don't do this.
Please don't do this.

28:24.771 --> 28:25.772
Ahh.

28:31.677 --> 28:33.345
Level completed.

28:33.379 --> 28:35.247
This is a game to them.

28:35.281 --> 28:39.485
Okay, so what's
the next level?

28:39.518 --> 28:41.320
Fin.

28:48.094 --> 28:49.361
Please.

28:49.395 --> 28:50.997
- Shut up, bitch.
- You don't have to do this.

28:51.030 --> 28:53.265
Shut up, bitch!

28:53.299 --> 28:58.204
Say another word, I'm gonna kill
you. Do you understand?

28:58.237 --> 29:00.206
Let's just do this.

29:02.574 --> 29:05.344
- Ready.
- Freaking go already.

29:05.377 --> 29:08.815
- Go.
- You're up.

29:08.848 --> 29:14.821
(computerized voice)
All you bitches,
you're on notice.

29:14.854 --> 29:16.555
So what do you mean
you have no idea how the van

29:16.588 --> 29:18.157
got onto your property?

29:18.190 --> 29:20.092
Yeah, okay. You do that.

29:20.126 --> 29:22.328
How are you doing,
Mr. Kaplan?

29:22.361 --> 29:23.662
I tried to tell her.

29:23.695 --> 29:26.532
You tried to tell her.
She just wouldn't listen.

29:26.565 --> 29:28.200
Hey, Sarge,
I got something.

29:28.234 --> 29:29.535
What is it?

29:29.568 --> 29:31.237
You know, Mr. Kaplan,
why don't you have a seat,

29:31.270 --> 29:32.939
and we'll be with
you in a moment.

29:40.046 --> 29:43.182
This link was just uploaded
to Red Channet.

29:43.215 --> 29:47.353
This is what happens to smug
bitches who mess with gamers.

29:47.386 --> 29:51.657
- [crying]
- We warned you.

29:51.690 --> 29:55.862
[screaming]

29:55.862 --> 29:58.865
Hey, gamer girl.

29:58.898 --> 30:00.699
Please don't.

30:00.732 --> 30:01.901
Where is this
coming from?

30:01.934 --> 30:03.903
All we know is
it's streaming live.

30:12.378 --> 30:12.578
.

30:12.611 --> 30:16.983
I realize now that gaming
is no place for females.

30:19.251 --> 30:23.555
So all you bitches
should get out now.

30:23.589 --> 30:28.627
You are not wanted,
and you are not safe.

30:28.660 --> 30:32.798
I also have a message
for Steven Kaplan,

30:32.831 --> 30:35.167
I never loved you.

30:35.201 --> 30:39.872
I only slept with you
so you'd back my game.

30:39.906 --> 30:43.475
I am a slut, and I am a liar.

30:43.509 --> 30:44.743
And this is live too?

30:44.776 --> 30:46.278
No, uploaded to
Red Channet.

30:46.312 --> 30:47.279
You do not want
to read the comments.

30:47.313 --> 30:49.148
- No, I don't.
- Hold up,

30:49.181 --> 30:51.383
this upload is geotagged.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.052
Look at it,
South Shore, Staten Island.

30:53.085 --> 30:55.054
It looks like a residential
address.

30:55.087 --> 30:56.488
- Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.
- Hold on.

30:56.522 --> 30:58.224
They've been using the dark net
this whole time,

30:58.257 --> 31:00.692
and now they leave a trail?

31:00.726 --> 31:02.061
This is a trap.

31:02.094 --> 31:03.362
They're playing a game.

31:03.395 --> 31:04.696
We got to play too.

31:04.730 --> 31:06.765
All right, the house
belongs to Mrs. Marissa Rossi,

31:06.798 --> 31:09.101
public school art teacher
she lives alone.

31:09.135 --> 31:10.636
Okay, should we call E.S.U.?

31:10.669 --> 31:12.638
We got to go easy, we don't
want them to set us up

31:12.671 --> 31:14.406
to SWAT somebody.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.208
Just go.

31:23.149 --> 31:26.652
[pounding on door]
(Rollins) Hey, come on.

31:26.685 --> 31:29.121
- Can I help you?
- NYPD, Mrs. Rossi?

31:29.155 --> 31:30.789
- Yes, that's me.
- Are you here alone?

31:30.822 --> 31:32.024
- Wait, what's going on?

31:32.058 --> 31:33.359
- Are you here alone?
- Yes, why?

31:33.392 --> 31:35.061
Because a woman was kidnapped,

31:35.094 --> 31:36.562
and her abductors
were here in this house tonight.

31:36.595 --> 31:38.430
Oh, no, no.
There must be some mistake.

31:38.464 --> 31:39.831
Ma'am, have you been
at home here all night?

31:39.865 --> 31:42.301
I got home an hour ago
from my book club.

31:42.334 --> 31:43.435
- Okay.
- Does anybody else live here?

31:43.469 --> 31:44.971
- No, just me.
- Who's this then?

31:45.004 --> 31:46.605
That's my husband
but he passed.

31:46.638 --> 31:47.773
No, the kid.
The kid.

31:47.806 --> 31:49.141
That's my son, Anthony.

31:49.175 --> 31:51.443
- He's away at college.
- Does he play video games?

31:51.477 --> 31:52.979
- Yes. Why?
- Where?

31:53.012 --> 31:55.181
Where does he play?

31:58.084 --> 31:59.418
There's the camera.

31:59.451 --> 32:02.854
They raped her here.

32:02.888 --> 32:04.656
Gun safe.

32:12.098 --> 32:14.066
Where are the guns?

32:16.468 --> 32:19.238
He's a good boy.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.207
He's shy.

32:21.240 --> 32:22.508
You've made a mistake.

32:22.541 --> 32:24.510
No, Mrs. Rossi,
we haven't made a mistake.

32:24.543 --> 32:27.479
We found evidence of sexual
assault in your basement,

32:27.513 --> 32:29.448
and your son's computer's
been logged into an account

32:29.481 --> 32:32.018
that has been threatening
Raina Punjabi for weeks.

32:32.018 --> 32:34.186
No.

32:35.721 --> 32:41.260
"I would love to gouge her
eyes out with a rusty spoon."

32:41.293 --> 32:43.895
He didn't write this.

32:43.929 --> 32:45.397
One of his friends, maybe,

32:45.431 --> 32:47.166
- but not my Anthony.
- Which friends.

32:47.199 --> 32:49.768
One of them from the
video games, you know?

32:49.801 --> 32:52.338
The way they talk
to each other.

32:52.371 --> 32:57.043
Anthony says it's just boy
talk, but he's not like that.

32:57.076 --> 32:58.610
He's from a good home.

32:58.644 --> 32:59.911
We raised him better.

32:59.945 --> 33:01.513
Hey, I believe that,
Mrs. Rossi.

33:01.547 --> 33:03.049
I really do.

33:03.049 --> 33:05.717
I grew up ten minutes drive from
you, just off of Arden, yeah.

33:05.751 --> 33:07.186
And I'm sure that Anthony
is a good kid,

33:07.219 --> 33:10.656
but somewhere along the line
Anthony got confused.

33:10.689 --> 33:12.891
He tried to hurt someone
without actually thinking

33:12.924 --> 33:15.327
about the actual person at
the other end of those messages,

33:15.361 --> 33:18.697
and that usually comes
from a place of pain,

33:18.730 --> 33:21.533
a feeling like,
like you don't matter.

33:21.567 --> 33:24.903
Now, does that sound
like Anthony?

33:24.936 --> 33:28.574
It's my husband's passing.

33:28.607 --> 33:31.377
It was very hard on him.

33:31.410 --> 33:33.845
Yeah.

33:33.879 --> 33:39.851
Even if he wrote
these messages...

33:39.885 --> 33:43.922
he would never want...

33:43.955 --> 33:46.658
to rape...

33:46.692 --> 33:48.594
or kill.

33:48.627 --> 33:49.961
He would never.

33:49.995 --> 33:51.263
Of course he wouldn't.

33:51.297 --> 33:53.099
I mean, this probably started
as a joke, you know.

33:53.099 --> 33:54.966
His friends' idea
just got out of hand,

33:55.000 --> 33:59.238
but what we want now
is for this to end peacefully,

33:59.271 --> 34:01.873
and that's what
you want too, isn't it?

34:08.380 --> 34:10.349
It took a while,
but Mrs. Rossi came to Jesus.

34:10.382 --> 34:11.717
Her husband was a gun buff.

34:11.750 --> 34:13.885
- Two pistols, 20 gauge shotgun.
- Great.

34:13.919 --> 34:16.855
Fin, do you think they're still
following a gamer script?

34:16.888 --> 34:19.391
Rape is a mod
in level 16 of K.O.B.S.

34:19.425 --> 34:22.661
Hold on, so they kidnap
and rape, and it's a game.

34:22.694 --> 34:25.131
It's like a user hack
of the game,

34:25.131 --> 34:26.198
but once they
make that move,

34:26.232 --> 34:28.134
there's only one
path you can go.

34:28.134 --> 34:33.339
- Which is what?
- Kill or be slaughtered.

34:33.372 --> 34:36.442
Rollins.
Raina?

34:36.475 --> 34:38.009
Yes, it's Raina.

34:38.043 --> 34:39.645
They've got me in a garage,

34:39.678 --> 34:42.314
and I think
they're gonna kill me.

34:42.348 --> 34:43.882
I need your help.

34:43.915 --> 34:45.751
Raina, are you
using your phone?

34:45.784 --> 34:47.219
No, I stole one of theirs.

34:47.253 --> 34:48.254
Please hurry.

34:48.287 --> 34:50.055
Do you know where you are?

34:50.156 --> 34:53.192
They're holding me in a
garage near Manhattan Bridge.

34:53.225 --> 34:55.594
There's a baseball field
across the street.

34:55.627 --> 34:58.797
Okay, hang tight, we will
be there as soon as we can.

34:58.830 --> 35:01.467
- Oh, no. They're coming back.
- Okay, we got to go now.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.602
This is the final
level of the game.

35:03.635 --> 35:04.903
They call the cops

35:04.936 --> 35:06.805
and when they rush in
to save her, they attack.

35:06.838 --> 35:08.174
This could be an ambush.

35:08.174 --> 35:10.476
Call E.S.U., tell them
we'll meet them there.

35:23.088 --> 35:25.557
If this is a set up they're
watching us from somewhere.

35:25.591 --> 35:27.193
Yeah, like up there.

35:27.193 --> 35:28.194
We're on it.

35:30.362 --> 35:31.430
Okay.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.332
Any communication
from the inside?

35:33.365 --> 35:34.533
No, nothing since the call,

35:34.566 --> 35:36.568
and we can't see inside.
What do you know?

35:36.602 --> 35:38.904
Three perps, two pistols,
and a 20 gauge.

35:38.937 --> 35:40.105
If they are inside.

35:40.206 --> 35:41.440
If?

35:41.473 --> 35:42.808
We think it may be a setup.

35:42.841 --> 35:44.843
[gunfire]
(SWAT officer) Shots fired.

35:44.876 --> 35:46.978
All right, setup or no,
we got to go.

35:47.012 --> 35:49.215
Flash bang, go now!

35:53.485 --> 35:56.622
(SWAT officer)
NYPD.

35:56.655 --> 35:57.889
Nobody move.

35:57.923 --> 35:59.725
NYPD, get down.
Let us see your hands.

36:11.537 --> 36:11.737
.

36:11.770 --> 36:14.473
- Gun. She's got a gun.
- Don't shoot.

36:14.506 --> 36:15.674
- She's got a gun.
- Don't shoot.

36:15.707 --> 36:18.244
(Benson)
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

36:18.277 --> 36:19.245
I said drop it!
Drop it!

36:19.278 --> 36:20.646
- I can't.
- Drop it!

36:20.679 --> 36:22.414
Okay, she can't,
it's taped to her wrists.

36:22.448 --> 36:24.149
Don't shoot.

36:24.250 --> 36:26.418
Raina.

36:26.452 --> 36:27.553
Raina.

36:27.586 --> 36:29.120
[crying]

36:29.154 --> 36:31.757
[gunfire]
Down!

36:31.790 --> 36:33.259
Coming out of the speaker
right here.

36:33.292 --> 36:34.526
- Okay.

36:37.596 --> 36:38.597
(police officer)
False alarm.

36:38.630 --> 36:39.631
Okay.

36:39.665 --> 36:41.633
Hey, just hang in there.

37:05.524 --> 37:07.493
You good?

37:08.927 --> 37:10.962
Hey, hey, put the gun down.

37:10.996 --> 37:12.063
Hands up.

37:12.097 --> 37:14.032
I never meant for
this to go so far.

37:14.065 --> 37:15.200
Brandon and Pierce made me.

37:15.301 --> 37:18.036
They're crazy.
They totally lost it.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.605
- It's freaking me out.
- Don't even, Anthony.

37:19.638 --> 37:21.840
They don't know what's
real and what's a game.

37:21.873 --> 37:23.675
I geotagged that video
from my mom's house

37:23.709 --> 37:24.710
so you could find us.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.312
Ah.

37:26.345 --> 37:28.314
I'm sure she's real proud.

37:31.483 --> 37:34.953
Drop it!

37:34.986 --> 37:36.087
Recoil.

37:36.121 --> 37:37.689
Not like shooting
in a video game, huh?

37:37.723 --> 37:40.326
Actually,
it's exactly the same.

37:42.394 --> 37:43.995
All right, you need
to think really carefully about

37:44.029 --> 37:48.734
- what you're doing right now.
- Don't talk, officer.

37:48.767 --> 37:52.438
Prepare to be slaughtered.

37:52.471 --> 37:55.073
Come out. Drop the gun
or I'll kill him now.

37:55.106 --> 37:57.843
Game over.
Drop the gun.

37:57.876 --> 37:58.844
Come on.

37:58.877 --> 38:00.078
Okay.

38:00.111 --> 38:02.548
There's 50 cops
surrounding this building.

38:02.581 --> 38:04.483
All for that skank, Raina.

38:04.516 --> 38:09.655
Isn't being a whore
a crime, huh?

38:09.688 --> 38:11.590
- You should arrest her.
- Drop the gun.

38:11.623 --> 38:14.360
Shut up, bitch!
You're just like Raina.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.628
Spitting in our faces.

38:16.662 --> 38:18.464
She took away the one thing
that we had.

38:18.497 --> 38:21.900
You heard what the lady said.
Drop the gun.

38:21.933 --> 38:24.102
Move, and I'll blow
your head off!

38:24.135 --> 38:25.471
Okay.

38:25.504 --> 38:27.072
This ain't a game.
Drop that gun.

38:27.105 --> 38:28.674
Okay. Okay.

38:28.707 --> 38:30.676
Got it.

38:33.645 --> 38:35.447
Go on, get on the ground.

38:35.481 --> 38:37.015
Get your hands up
over your head.

38:37.048 --> 38:38.116
You all right?

38:38.149 --> 38:39.985
What, were you
camping back there?

38:40.018 --> 38:41.887
I know.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.755
Bad form but effective.

38:57.168 --> 38:58.537
So 20 years of gaming,

38:58.570 --> 39:00.205
or whatever it is you do
with that controller,

39:00.238 --> 39:02.608
finally paid off.

39:02.641 --> 39:04.410
See, I know the
difference between

39:04.410 --> 39:06.678
video games and reality.

39:06.712 --> 39:09.415
Those guys didn't.

39:09.448 --> 39:14.119
So this is gonna be
a big I.A.B. thing now?

39:14.152 --> 39:17.022
You're on administrative
duty for a few days.

39:23.429 --> 39:29.034
No, no need to give up
your gun and shield.

39:29.067 --> 39:30.936
This was a good shoot.

39:30.969 --> 39:34.506
After what they did to Raina,
there was no gray area.

39:34.540 --> 39:37.443
I just went and got
the bad guy.

39:37.443 --> 39:40.579
We both know that
it's never that easy.

39:40.612 --> 39:44.115
We do the best we can.

39:44.149 --> 39:46.117
Go home.

39:57.028 --> 40:02.033
One of them took a plea,
the other wants to go to trial.

40:02.067 --> 40:04.503
Will Raina have to testify?

40:04.536 --> 40:08.206
I don't think she's up to
facing them in court.

40:08.239 --> 40:11.443
You'll have time, Raina.

40:11.477 --> 40:16.381
I'll be fine.

40:16.414 --> 40:20.118
Women in gaming,
what did I expect?

40:23.354 --> 40:27.092
You didn't deserve this.

40:27.125 --> 40:29.327
Whatever.

40:29.360 --> 40:32.631
I'm out.

40:32.664 --> 40:36.735
You said if you gave up,
they'd win.

40:41.306 --> 40:44.275
They already did.
