00:10.000 --> 00:22.000
You're Watching on 123Movies.to

01:35.386 --> 01:36.317
Where is Tarek?

01:40.727 --> 01:42.507
How did you arrive here?

01:42.835 --> 01:45.554
By the flight of midday, that of the morning was full.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.115
By the wall of Qalandia.

01:49.235 --> 01:50.435
Business class or économy?

01:50.555 --> 01:52.352
No, in économy, I nearly died!

01:53.135 --> 01:54.384
You all go play outside.

01:55.197 --> 01:56.077
And you, your duties!

01:56.395 --> 01:58.078
Why did you not cross by El Ram?

01:58.315 --> 01:59.509
Too crowded.

02:14.289 --> 02:16.187
Will give you some coffee only if you imitate Brando.

02:16.950 --> 02:18.699
- Another time?
- No

02:19.395 --> 02:20.790
- Please.
- No

02:21.502 --> 02:22.304
Come on

02:32.010 --> 02:33.728
OK fine, hold on.

02:37.075 --> 02:39.464
- You want the French version?
- No

02:52.195 --> 02:54.190
Drink your coffee and we shall go.

02:54.555 --> 02:56.227
- I want to come.
- Where to?

02:56.675 --> 02:58.074
You talk too much.

02:58.275 --> 02:59.344
You stay there.

03:00.210 --> 03:01.477
You stay there, I say to you!

03:31.195 --> 03:32.520
They are ready, the guys.

03:36.040 --> 03:37.633
I am going to inform the brigade.

03:48.355 --> 03:49.596
Inspire...

03:50.645 --> 03:53.183
Fix it. You divert the gun and you plate it!

04:05.035 --> 04:06.278
Go buy another packet.

04:07.395 --> 04:08.788
Vas-y, toi.
I am not the only one here.

04:09.395 --> 04:10.995
You rebel now?

04:11.115 --> 04:11.965
Why you get worked up?

04:12.675 --> 04:15.473
I have seven sisters and none of them is married.

04:16.154 --> 04:17.829
It is my responsibility to feed them.

04:17.983 --> 04:21.266
Don't misunderstand me, They are nice,

04:21.995 --> 04:23.737
that God preserves them,

04:24.475 --> 04:27.148
but none of you are handsome.

04:33.155 --> 04:35.908
Why don't you ever tell jokes?

04:36.451 --> 04:38.241
- I don't know how to tell.
- Just one.

04:38.915 --> 04:40.030
Please

04:40.832 --> 04:42.573
Promise, you all will not laugh.

04:42.806 --> 04:44.945
I will not, I swear you.

04:45.395 --> 04:46.874
For me and Omar.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.081
- OK. For you.
- Not for Omar?

04:50.201 --> 04:51.548
No, only for you.

04:51.818 --> 04:55.249
A guy goes to buy cigarettes.

04:55.955 --> 04:59.265
The seller gives him a packet and the guy reads...

04:59.915 --> 05:01.143
on top:

05:01.336 --> 05:04.117
'Smoke at night for maximum sexual performance'.

05:04.237 --> 05:06.876
Then he says: 'Give me rather that with the cancer.'

05:08.618 --> 05:10.976
Maximum sexual performance...

05:16.355 --> 05:17.708
Asshole!

05:19.915 --> 05:22.349
I touched first the stomach,

05:22.755 --> 05:26.748
the 2nd, at the head with my elbow, and the 3rd,
I bashed it with the face!

05:27.395 --> 05:29.909
His teeth indented my pronunciations.

05:30.915 --> 05:34.988
It was so deep that would have been able to you plant onions there.

05:35.888 --> 05:39.907
That my sisters are transformed into ugly monkeys,
if I go too far.

05:42.995 --> 05:44.508
Do you love Nadia?

05:45.940 --> 05:47.488
You want to kill me?

05:48.791 --> 05:52.346
I am crazy about her.
I don't know what to do.

05:52.635 --> 05:53.560
Then close it.

05:54.155 --> 05:56.350
If Tarek learns it, he will break up.

05:56.776 --> 06:00.026
It is crazy of me also.
But I am not going to react.

06:00.235 --> 06:02.566
- On the head of your sisters?
- Your face!

06:02.686 --> 06:04.387
I have letters which prove it.

07:24.987 --> 07:26.110
What are you doing there?

07:28.675 --> 07:29.630
You love me?

07:34.475 --> 07:35.828
You have anybody else?

07:36.648 --> 07:38.990
How is that?
Who do you want me to have?

07:44.235 --> 07:45.252
You speak about Brad Pitt!

07:49.835 --> 07:51.826
In fact, I came to give you this.

07:55.935 --> 07:59.424
Come to see yourself after classes,
I shall be alone.

08:04.477 --> 08:06.065
You already miss me.

08:47.036 --> 08:49.145
Stop! Stay where you are!

08:49.955 --> 08:51.547
Stay where you are!

08:53.458 --> 08:56.069
Hands on the head and then do not move!

09:10.075 --> 09:12.987
Raise your T-shirt and turn slowly.

09:20.870 --> 09:22.513
Hands on the head.

09:23.185 --> 09:24.401
Come towards me.

09:46.155 --> 09:47.194
Stop.

09:48.359 --> 09:50.387
- Where are you going?
- To my job

09:50.635 --> 09:51.985
Where are you coming from?

09:52.724 --> 09:53.801
From the casino.

09:54.275 --> 09:55.833
You are funny.

09:56.435 --> 09:57.459
Identity card.

10:09.515 --> 10:11.527
- Where were you?
- At my girlfriend's.

10:12.198 --> 10:13.467
A Don Juan!

10:14.857 --> 10:15.895
What's, this?

10:16.900 --> 10:18.418
She scratched you?

10:20.517 --> 10:21.590
Turn.

10:27.395 --> 10:30.273
You see stone, over there?
Stand on top of it.

10:36.293 --> 10:38.000
On stone, I said.

11:17.075 --> 11:18.715
You done with this circus?

11:20.958 --> 11:23.301
If you are men, drop your weapons

11:23.475 --> 11:24.749
- and fight.
- Don't move!

11:37.275 --> 11:38.480
You see stone, over there?

11:39.680 --> 11:41.193
Stand on top of it.

11:42.075 --> 11:44.066
but on one leg this time.

12:04.995 --> 12:06.428
- Yours.
- Thank you

12:06.630 --> 12:08.324
- Good day.
- To you too.

12:13.880 --> 12:15.234
Why this evening?

12:16.859 --> 12:19.073
To wait, it is to extend occupation.

12:20.184 --> 12:21.304
That's true.

12:32.029 --> 12:33.867
What happened to your nose?

12:34.697 --> 12:36.427
I fell off bike.

13:02.915 --> 13:06.995
He had perhaps every reason to replace
Diarra with Karim Benzema.

13:07.115 --> 13:08.175
It was a serious error

13:08.295 --> 13:10.232
to leave out Marcello.

13:10.688 --> 13:13.037
How he became coach

13:13.157 --> 13:15.457
by being the translator of the team?

13:16.068 --> 13:18.071
- Idiot.
- Attention!

13:20.435 --> 13:21.321
Pass me the salt.

14:45.355 --> 14:46.754
Inspire profoundly,

14:47.435 --> 14:48.993
fix your objective

14:49.395 --> 14:50.510
and run.

14:55.555 --> 14:57.386
You can do it on my place?

14:59.675 --> 15:01.235
We have already discussed it.

15:01.355 --> 15:03.871
Omar steals the car, I plan everything

15:03.991 --> 15:05.555
- and you, you shoot
- I can take responsibility for it.

15:05.675 --> 15:07.393
No. It is no game!

15:07.513 --> 15:10.550
One does not become a fair resistance fighter by watching.

15:47.816 --> 15:48.822
Quickly!

16:44.795 --> 16:46.023
What you think of him?

17:13.395 --> 17:14.307
"Where is Tarek?"

17:14.714 --> 17:15.759
Where is Tarek?

17:17.474 --> 17:18.682
Are you serious?

17:38.315 --> 17:39.430
Soon.

17:40.275 --> 17:42.235
Every week, it is the same catchphrase.

17:42.355 --> 17:43.868
There, it differs.

17:44.115 --> 17:46.470
I decided to speak to Tarek today.

17:56.961 --> 17:58.391
We will go where on honeymoon?

17:58.610 --> 17:59.550
Mozambique.

18:00.201 --> 18:01.545
Why not Bangladesh?

18:01.955 --> 18:04.270
They have enough disasters.
No need for one more.

18:05.115 --> 18:05.959
Be serious!

18:07.435 --> 18:09.630
You want me to be serious now?

18:09.892 --> 18:12.436
A honeymoon or your studies?

18:12.556 --> 18:13.823
What is your choice?

18:14.515 --> 18:16.277
Fine, I take you...

18:17.533 --> 18:18.679
to Paris, then?

18:19.170 --> 18:20.785
I have never been to Paris.

18:22.057 --> 18:24.150
And you have never gone out of this hole?

18:24.759 --> 18:27.672
- I went to Hébron.
- It is like Paris!

18:28.992 --> 18:30.920
Because you, already went out of this hole?

18:31.395 --> 18:33.694
No need to, I have you, you.

18:35.027 --> 18:36.121
You make fun of me?

18:37.075 --> 18:37.997
Never.

18:46.308 --> 18:50.068
I liked your last letter.
The story of the lame person is true?

18:50.490 --> 18:51.835
Half.

18:52.117 --> 18:54.788
Never mind, I loved. It was sad.

18:55.895 --> 18:59.384
Before, your stories were joyful.
You changed because of me?

19:01.299 --> 19:02.673
You have an eyelash...

19:45.715 --> 19:47.915
You know how they catch the monkey in Africa?

19:49.235 --> 19:52.432
The hunters throw them some sugar to make them cross.

19:52.915 --> 19:57.147
Then they dig narrow holes and fill them with sugar.

19:58.355 --> 20:01.904
When the monkey passes, he smells the sugar

20:02.170 --> 20:05.364
and plant the small hand to take the sugar.

20:05.919 --> 20:09.756
But he cannot take out his fist without dropping the sugar.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.035
The hunters get closer

20:12.155 --> 20:13.915
and the monkey sees them arriving.

20:14.035 --> 20:15.550
They unfold their nets

20:15.670 --> 20:18.275
but still the monkey does not want to drop the sugar.

20:18.826 --> 20:21.028
What they make, of monkeys?

20:21.596 --> 20:24.115
They grant them grants for the Sweden.

20:24.235 --> 20:27.394
- Fool!
- That you want them to do it?

20:30.435 --> 20:31.424
Tarek...

20:32.355 --> 20:33.231
Yes?

20:38.475 --> 20:40.386
- What?
- This bread is stale.

20:41.875 --> 20:44.469
He takes out no oven as you in whizz habit.

20:48.115 --> 20:51.903
- I think of settling down.
- Where you acquired enough money?

20:53.675 --> 20:55.711
I save to build a home....

20:55.875 --> 20:57.354
The police officers!

22:53.595 --> 22:54.994
Who was with you?

23:03.475 --> 23:04.988
Who was with you?

23:12.947 --> 23:14.627
Who shot the soldier?

23:17.995 --> 23:19.394
Who was with you?

23:23.435 --> 23:25.153
Who shot the soldier?

23:39.355 --> 23:40.583
Who shot?

23:49.635 --> 23:51.070
Who was with you?

23:59.437 --> 24:00.510
What?

24:08.955 --> 24:09.924
I hear nothing.

24:14.635 --> 24:15.954
I hear nothing!

24:18.275 --> 24:19.993
Dry your nose.

26:16.675 --> 26:17.949
I also.

26:21.738 --> 26:25.110
They are soon going to free me,
they do not have proof.

26:27.395 --> 26:29.909
Hold out and they will be united.

27:00.875 --> 27:04.185
Ehab El Abdallah, Hamas.
You are with whom, who puts together?

28:09.795 --> 28:12.358
I am Hassan Ismail, brigades of Al-Aqsa.

28:20.115 --> 28:21.193
Where you come from?

28:34.555 --> 28:35.954
Of what they accuse you?

28:38.835 --> 28:40.325
I just want to tell you,

28:40.835 --> 28:42.029
be careful.

28:43.475 --> 28:46.990
Next days are critical. You know it surely.

28:47.567 --> 28:50.348
They are first going to send you a mole.

28:51.795 --> 28:55.344
A prisoner who works with them.
So that he becomes your friend.

28:55.676 --> 28:57.724
He will entrust you his secrets.

28:59.115 --> 29:02.152
You will trust in him and you will say to him everything.

29:05.675 --> 29:08.550
But he will have a microphone to record your admissions.

29:09.155 --> 29:12.113
Pay attention. Speak to nobody of your actions.

29:12.635 --> 29:16.144
As long as you will not speak,
they will not be able to judge you.

29:24.315 --> 29:25.873
But listen me good.

29:27.755 --> 29:29.427
If you don't confess,

29:30.155 --> 29:32.024
they will break your will,

29:32.235 --> 29:35.915
will make you dependent and make a collaborator of you.

29:36.035 --> 29:37.275
Then pay attention.

29:37.395 --> 29:39.431
Never become a collaborator.

29:40.355 --> 29:42.232
Afterwards, they come back for more.

29:42.475 --> 29:44.037
There is not exit...

29:44.317 --> 29:45.835
and this does not end.

29:47.115 --> 29:48.992
I shall never confess.

29:53.035 --> 29:54.104
Good.

29:56.355 --> 29:57.708
Good.

30:38.240 --> 30:40.008
<i>I shall never confess.</i>

30:47.407 --> 30:50.068
It is an admission, according to our judges.

30:50.795 --> 30:52.433
I have no clue about what you speak.

30:53.155 --> 30:54.406
Certainly true.

30:55.795 --> 30:57.945
Speak to your lawyer.

30:59.966 --> 31:02.065
I can do nothing for you.

31:06.075 --> 31:07.349
Unless...

31:08.755 --> 31:10.905
you want to work with us.

31:19.715 --> 31:21.945
Think about it. Take your time.

31:31.995 --> 31:34.828
In the court-martial, where you will be judged,

31:34.948 --> 31:36.670
this is taken for a confession.

31:38.275 --> 31:40.027
What are the consequences?

31:40.432 --> 31:43.207
At the very least, you will get 90 years.

31:52.835 --> 31:54.791
They can do something?

31:57.240 --> 32:00.073
As long as there will be occupation, no.

32:27.857 --> 32:29.347
Tell me, Omar,

32:32.115 --> 32:34.185
you know a girl, is it not?

32:36.675 --> 32:38.427
You see about whom I speak?

32:47.588 --> 32:49.590
Her name is how already?

32:59.675 --> 33:03.873
They know and they want you to be with her.

33:05.315 --> 33:08.917
But if you do not collaborate,
your life will be a Hell forever.

33:09.446 --> 33:11.346
Do not forget your girlfriend.

33:11.510 --> 33:13.908
Don't look at me like that. I did not bring you in here.

33:14.506 --> 33:16.314
Listen to what I'm saying.

33:16.955 --> 33:18.448
You are trapped.

33:18.802 --> 33:21.955
You need to choose between your life and that of your friends.

33:22.075 --> 33:23.812
It is a difficult choice.

33:24.155 --> 33:26.703
But if I was on your place,

33:27.053 --> 33:29.688
I would choose my life, it is normal.

33:29.808 --> 33:31.273
You want what?

33:35.933 --> 33:38.415
They know that you did not kill the soldier.

33:39.569 --> 33:43.470
If you deliver us information to catch the murderer,

33:44.675 --> 33:48.588
We erase your past and they let you in zero to live again.

33:49.035 --> 33:52.195
- Who killed the soldier?
- Stop, you know it definitely.

33:52.315 --> 33:53.987
No, I do not know.

33:54.635 --> 33:55.954
Fine.

33:57.449 --> 33:59.431
You want to play this game?

33:59.890 --> 34:01.553
no problem.

34:03.795 --> 34:05.547
Tarek Abd-Al-Salam.

34:12.882 --> 34:15.578
They will let not escape the murderer of a soldier.

34:15.697 --> 34:17.824
They will catch him, no matter what.

34:24.995 --> 34:26.292
I give you one month.

34:27.275 --> 34:28.735
If they do not have what they want,

34:29.395 --> 34:31.750
I promise you whom I would return you where you come from.

34:32.539 --> 34:35.751
And believe me, you will not wish to go back to it.

36:00.544 --> 36:01.813
You missed me.

36:08.075 --> 36:09.224
You feel pain?

36:10.000 --> 36:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:30.195 --> 36:32.414
I too, I wrote you a lot of letters.

36:32.754 --> 36:35.755
I do not sleep any more since your arrest.
I write poems.

36:35.875 --> 36:38.686
I ignored that love could be so painful.

36:39.186 --> 36:41.064
What did you make in my absence?

36:41.697 --> 36:42.483
Nothing.

36:43.008 --> 36:45.457
I dreamed to learn to shoot to free yourselves.

36:52.075 --> 36:53.030
Omar...

36:54.879 --> 36:57.035
You were behind Operation Huwara?

36:57.155 --> 36:58.585
do not speak of this.

36:58.705 --> 37:01.428
- I want to know.
- Better not.

37:02.441 --> 37:03.836
You do not trust in me?

37:04.798 --> 37:05.671
Nadia...

37:05.791 --> 37:07.448
it is for your own security.

37:08.029 --> 37:10.068
- I am serious.
- Me too.

37:10.290 --> 37:12.027
Please Nadia, believe me.

37:12.147 --> 37:15.187
Concentrate on your studies. I plead you.

37:16.227 --> 37:17.805
Plead me more strongly.

37:18.590 --> 37:19.998
I ask you.

37:21.926 --> 37:25.226
It is definitely because you plead the world most nicely.

37:28.801 --> 37:30.494
They were hard with you in prison?

37:31.602 --> 37:32.845
Where I can find Tarek?

37:34.020 --> 37:36.913
I don't know, he stays more at the house.

37:37.115 --> 37:39.765
- Omar, I am anxious.
- Don't worry.

37:40.078 --> 37:43.550
I control situation.
Be strong and we will be united.

37:44.395 --> 37:46.704
- I shall believe you.
- I promise.

37:46.915 --> 37:49.713
I am going to regulate all this. It is promised.

38:16.555 --> 38:17.603
Bonjour, Omar.

38:17.723 --> 38:20.314
Tell Amjad that I will leave a number

38:20.434 --> 38:21.805
where he can reach me every midday.

38:21.925 --> 38:24.494
- When did you go out of prison?
- just taken out from solitary.

38:24.614 --> 38:26.804
- Who made you this?
- I will find out.

38:27.035 --> 38:29.595
- You get married when?
- after you, God willing.

39:33.594 --> 39:36.195
You have a splendid mind.
How you doing?

39:37.635 --> 39:40.103
- What do they want?
- that I deliver you to them.

39:40.995 --> 39:42.553
For them, you are the shooter.

39:44.635 --> 39:46.252
We have a bigger problem:

39:47.197 --> 39:48.389
There is a traitor among us.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.916
Who knew about operation?

39:52.915 --> 39:54.394
Everybody is suspicious.

39:55.367 --> 39:58.115
This could be it, this could be you

39:58.290 --> 39:59.828
Amjad or me.

40:00.555 --> 40:02.033
How is that, one of us?

40:02.635 --> 40:04.626
A rat is enough to ruin everything.

40:10.585 --> 40:13.065
Explain. How you contact them?

40:13.447 --> 40:16.390
I have a number to be called when I shall know where you are.

40:17.355 --> 40:19.846
If they rolled them?
They tighten them a trap.

40:20.013 --> 40:21.872
But there is a traitor among us!

40:22.163 --> 40:24.590
They will do nothing before having had it.

40:27.330 --> 40:28.424
Tarek!

40:41.698 --> 40:42.790
If I had confessed,

40:42.995 --> 40:45.463
they would search me instead of Tarek.

40:50.715 --> 40:52.670
I am indebted to you for this deed.

40:55.666 --> 40:57.110
We won't fail you.

40:57.638 --> 40:59.910
remain no more than 10 minutes publicly.

41:00.030 --> 41:02.294
It is not easy to be rush about there.

41:05.155 --> 41:07.146
Call this number from a booth

41:07.355 --> 41:10.188
and give them the time and the place where you will wait.

41:10.875 --> 41:12.069
Tarek...

41:12.875 --> 41:14.124
I want to marry Nadia

41:18.075 --> 41:19.953
You think that it is the good moment?

41:20.930 --> 41:22.314
I want to marry her.

41:22.570 --> 41:24.949
They have all reasons to suspect you.

41:25.515 --> 41:26.995
If trap succeeds,

41:27.115 --> 41:29.167
they will know that you are one of us.

41:29.287 --> 41:32.034
- You have really just said this?
- Omar...

41:32.635 --> 41:36.787
If you want to liberate your country,
there is a price to be paid.

41:37.619 --> 41:40.712
Neither feel sorry, nor tears.
It is the choice which you made.

41:44.035 --> 41:46.629
Whatever it costs me, I want to marry Nadia.

41:48.475 --> 41:50.067
Let me think about it.

41:50.746 --> 41:52.626
Let us be first in charge of trap

41:53.249 --> 41:55.072
and I promise to help you.

42:00.795 --> 42:02.112
You know that?

42:03.338 --> 42:05.926
three men consult a spiritual leader:

42:06.046 --> 42:08.881
"If they were on the point of liberating Jerusalem,

42:09.001 --> 42:12.032
"could they lark about with the wives of our enemies?"

42:12.447 --> 42:16.154
He answers: "Do it and you will even be able to lark about with me."

42:22.536 --> 42:24.425
We are first in charge of trap.

42:25.314 --> 42:26.403
Fine?

43:03.476 --> 43:05.604
They would put the bed here, the table there.

43:06.207 --> 43:07.486
The Television...

43:08.038 --> 43:10.429
There, we could construct a shelter for the cat.

43:21.950 --> 43:26.192
Poor guy, needed to let live and him send an opinion of expulsion it.

43:27.103 --> 43:28.520
We call an ambulance?

43:30.875 --> 43:32.433
What you say about it?

43:36.650 --> 43:38.308
I dreamed to leave from here.

43:40.835 --> 43:42.587
Have you ever thought of it?

43:42.915 --> 43:44.553
I make of my the best.

43:45.826 --> 43:47.746
I know, it is fair that...

43:48.545 --> 43:50.824
I am ready to live anywhere with you.

43:51.035 --> 43:53.310
- Even on Mars.
- it is too far.

43:54.150 --> 43:55.554
Let us stay here.

43:56.115 --> 43:58.463
It doesn't much matter where.
I just want to be with you.

44:04.596 --> 44:06.595
Your last letter was odd.

44:06.715 --> 44:08.389
You really speak to ants?

44:08.610 --> 44:09.998
I spoke to Tarek.

44:10.620 --> 44:12.034
He is going to help us.

44:19.995 --> 44:22.065
I made you this to protect you.

44:26.610 --> 44:27.908
Thread It.

45:16.435 --> 45:18.595
Deliver Tarek in month?

45:18.715 --> 45:20.995
I am not an electric company!

45:21.115 --> 45:23.709
<i>I waste my time. It is not a game.</i>

45:23.915 --> 45:25.635
Why he would believe me?

45:25.755 --> 45:28.315
<i>Obey or I come to search you by ears.</i>

46:04.718 --> 46:06.996
They gave you what to eat in prison?

46:07.116 --> 46:10.904
The stuffed chicken, the stuffed summer squash, the pizza...

47:38.195 --> 47:39.131
Kicks 6061...

49:37.715 --> 49:39.075
Why are you so pale?

49:39.195 --> 49:40.302
They followed me.

49:40.475 --> 49:41.550
I led them.

49:42.075 --> 49:43.110
Really?

49:43.475 --> 49:44.547
Be careful.

49:45.395 --> 49:46.714
How are you doing?

49:47.675 --> 49:49.472
Better now that I see you.

49:51.267 --> 49:52.536
You slimmed.

49:53.435 --> 49:54.834
I am à la mode.

50:00.500 --> 50:03.128
How I can reach you?
You miss me so much.

50:05.180 --> 50:08.073
not easy at the moment.
This will be simpler after trap.

50:16.240 --> 50:17.648
What traps?

50:24.645 --> 50:25.870
What traps?

50:33.135 --> 50:34.150
This is not going to happen?

50:38.663 --> 50:40.434
Amina tells everyone that you are a traitor.

50:41.955 --> 50:43.835
Many girls believe it,

50:43.955 --> 50:45.637
they say that it is surely true,

50:46.250 --> 50:47.833
because they quickly set you free.

50:47.953 --> 50:49.314
do not listen to them.

50:49.434 --> 50:51.193
Soon, you will see.

50:51.576 --> 50:53.148
"Soon, soon..."

50:58.835 --> 51:00.314
I saw Amjad speaking to you.

51:02.595 --> 51:04.904
- You are me?
- he wants what, Amjad?

51:06.115 --> 51:07.514
It made that to pass.

51:08.227 --> 51:09.207
My dear,

51:09.622 --> 51:11.028
do not get worried.

51:11.275 --> 51:12.993
What he said to you, Tarek?

51:17.995 --> 51:20.555
Omar, trust in me. There is nothing.

51:21.075 --> 51:22.663
He reassured me: You are not a spy.

51:22.783 --> 51:25.177
What? You suspect me?

51:25.690 --> 51:27.395
I need to be reassured in your absence.

51:27.515 --> 51:29.306
To whom do you want me to go?

51:33.315 --> 51:34.794
You suspect me?

51:36.049 --> 51:37.877
The traitors end up falling.

51:42.706 --> 51:44.306
I plead you.

51:45.158 --> 51:47.509
I crossed my life wedged in the corner here...

51:49.008 --> 51:51.110
The sea is only in 15 km

51:51.837 --> 51:56.253
and I have never seen it.
It is fair that they promised...

51:58.416 --> 51:59.785
to get me a visa.

51:59.905 --> 52:02.303
A visa? What visa?

52:02.875 --> 52:05.213
A visa for New Zealand.

52:07.115 --> 52:08.867
Why New Zealand?

52:09.675 --> 52:11.870
The sea, nature,

52:12.803 --> 52:13.678
life.

52:13.798 --> 52:15.815
You betrayed the cause for a visa?

52:15.935 --> 52:18.223
- That brought me a cause?
- you believed what?

52:18.395 --> 52:19.796
An association of beneficence?

52:22.315 --> 52:24.670
New Zealand? Son of a Bitch!

52:27.567 --> 52:29.387
Where is New Zealand?

52:37.204 --> 52:39.033
I had a feeling that they would find him.

52:39.153 --> 52:41.390
They can tighten trap, now.

52:42.195 --> 52:43.556
And afterwards, me wife Nadia?

52:44.435 --> 52:47.350
Certainly, if he accepts.
And my family also.

52:47.610 --> 52:49.510
There will not be any objections.

52:49.770 --> 52:51.325
proves that you are a man.

52:55.626 --> 52:57.414
Amjad also asked for the hand.

52:58.075 --> 53:00.962
do not get worried, I shall speak to him After the ambush.

53:04.045 --> 53:05.164
Omar...

53:08.035 --> 53:10.150
Make a copy There and you return it to me.

53:22.338 --> 53:26.228
The idea of sending your guys worked:
It gets closer to me.

53:27.329 --> 53:29.177
<i>Thet want what, now?</i>

53:35.377 --> 53:38.187
Meet tomorrow at 15 hours in the restaurant Abu-Assab.

54:05.675 --> 54:08.235
My grandmother died at the age of 92 years.

54:09.675 --> 54:11.532
You know that it was the error of the doctor?

54:46.830 --> 54:48.278
They are late.

54:49.437 --> 54:51.107
Are you sure that Hussam was the traitor?

54:51.795 --> 54:53.433
He confessed, hushed up about the rumor.

54:54.415 --> 54:56.864
They make you say everything under duress.

54:58.280 --> 54:59.995
Forget. They have other worries.

55:01.435 --> 55:03.633
- What you told him?
- what they did to the traitors.

55:29.795 --> 55:31.268
You angry at me?

55:32.959 --> 55:34.777
Why are you angry at me?

55:35.408 --> 55:37.596
While I risk my skin for you!

55:38.760 --> 55:40.353
You think you are clever?

55:40.995 --> 55:42.263
Kind of fool!

55:45.638 --> 55:47.950
I told you that they knew everything.

55:49.366 --> 55:51.465
They know that you love his sister.

55:52.548 --> 55:56.588
And you know what?
You are never going to see her again.

55:58.395 --> 56:00.511
does have your life in air!

56:00.995 --> 56:03.168
This son of Bitch of Tarek

56:03.288 --> 56:05.926
is perhaps always in a hurry, but I swear you

56:06.046 --> 56:08.469
that they will find him at all costs.

56:09.079 --> 56:10.830
And your baby Nadia?

56:16.059 --> 56:17.992
They know all her secrets.

56:19.635 --> 56:23.025
They can make a bitch out of her at any time.

56:28.610 --> 56:31.435
I know even where you wanted to take her on your honeymoon trip,

56:31.555 --> 56:33.386
little son of a bitch.

57:42.920 --> 57:44.258
It is you.

57:45.554 --> 57:46.743
Traitor.

57:47.110 --> 57:49.038
- Traitor!
- They are going to hang you.

58:02.515 --> 58:03.789
What happened?

58:05.776 --> 58:07.794
two guys wanted to kiss me.

58:08.870 --> 58:10.568
I crushed their bones.

58:17.719 --> 58:19.018
Listen to me, Omar...

58:19.675 --> 58:21.745
I cannot trust you any more.

58:22.359 --> 58:25.394
You are not just a liar,
you are also involved

58:25.514 --> 58:27.830
in an ambush against us.

58:28.328 --> 58:30.431
I'm sad, I can do nothing for you.

58:37.035 --> 58:37.926
Good morning, Dear.

58:39.590 --> 58:41.353
No, I can not.

58:42.995 --> 58:45.907
I can not!
I am in the West Bank of Jordan.

58:47.025 --> 58:50.544
What do you expect me to do?
I am not Spider-Man!

58:51.521 --> 58:54.890
I am going to see what I can do.
But it is necessary that you...

59:07.180 --> 59:08.588
Good morning, mum.

59:09.435 --> 59:11.107
It is me, listen...

59:12.156 --> 59:14.672
Can you go bring Maya from the day nursery?

59:16.515 --> 59:20.896
Mum, I am at job, right in the town of West Bank of Jordan,

59:21.299 --> 59:24.950
and you want to fulminate against my rotten woman?

59:25.328 --> 59:27.667
Can you go get Maya, yes or no?

59:29.755 --> 59:30.929
At 16 hours.

59:33.527 --> 59:34.590
Thank you, mum.

59:40.552 --> 59:42.313
Where did you learn to speak Arab?

59:42.475 --> 59:44.511
How is that? It is my job.

59:46.949 --> 59:48.687
I thought that you were Arab.

59:49.635 --> 59:50.774
Really?

59:51.635 --> 59:53.591
listen to your accent?

59:59.188 --> 01:00:00.469
You speak Hebrew?

01:00:01.397 --> 01:00:03.095
I understood two words:

01:00:03.355 --> 01:00:05.005
"Mum" and "Spider-Man".

01:00:15.148 --> 01:00:16.387
Listen to me...

01:00:22.715 --> 01:00:26.390
I want to help you, but I can do nothing.

01:00:27.378 --> 01:00:29.699
And more nobody trusts in you.

01:00:30.386 --> 01:00:34.003
I nearly lost my job because of you, you understand?

01:00:35.555 --> 01:00:37.407
Give Me a last chance.

01:00:38.847 --> 01:00:40.395
This taught me a lesson.

01:00:45.076 --> 01:00:46.946
If I stay here, I am going to die.

01:01:09.355 --> 01:01:10.788
She misses you?

01:01:13.969 --> 01:01:15.687
What do you know about her?

01:01:17.435 --> 01:01:18.788
What secrets?

01:01:21.795 --> 01:01:24.036
secrets are supposed to remain secret.

01:01:29.735 --> 01:01:32.183
But they will use it, if you betray us.

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:43.675
don't try to hide, they will be able to locate you everywhere,

01:01:43.795 --> 01:01:46.104
even if you are underground.

01:01:46.955 --> 01:01:50.345
to clear you out from it, it is necessary to cut your leg.

01:01:51.795 --> 01:01:54.735
Bring back me the head of Tarek and you are a free man.

01:01:56.515 --> 01:01:57.885
I tell you:

01:01:58.955 --> 01:02:00.964
It is your last chance.

01:02:02.068 --> 01:02:04.470
I am taking a personal risk.

01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:11.178
If you fail,

01:02:14.129 --> 01:02:15.927
you will regret having been born.

01:02:37.887 --> 01:02:38.837
Nadia!

01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:43.915
- I have to speak to you.
- Leave me alone.

01:02:44.035 --> 01:02:45.835
- What's up?
- you need to tell me straight.

01:02:45.955 --> 01:02:46.910
What?

01:02:47.195 --> 01:02:48.393
Are you a Traitor?

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:56.433
You believe this?

01:02:56.995 --> 01:02:58.945
Four of our combatants were killed.

01:03:01.155 --> 01:03:02.907
Everybody says that you are a collaborator.

01:03:03.027 --> 01:03:04.391
And you didn't even kill the soldier.

01:03:05.075 --> 01:03:06.667
They all making a mistake.

01:03:09.875 --> 01:03:13.967
- They want not us to be together.
- I ask you. Need that they speak.

01:03:26.195 --> 01:03:28.470
You know since when I am waiting for this moment?

01:03:30.675 --> 01:03:35.351
You imagine the Hell which I go through by being without answer?

01:03:38.129 --> 01:03:41.192
I just want to know one thing:
That's true or not?

01:03:46.570 --> 01:03:47.954
Say to Me that's not!

01:03:48.515 --> 01:03:50.159
I am risking my life for you.

01:03:50.635 --> 01:03:52.785
I am ready to wait you for all my life,

01:03:53.195 --> 01:03:57.268
but swear on our love that it is wrong, that you are not a traitor.

01:04:04.790 --> 01:04:06.234
Then that's true....

01:04:12.478 --> 01:04:14.996
Who said to you that
I had not killed the soldier?

01:04:17.115 --> 01:04:19.605
You change the subject? That's true or not?

01:04:21.555 --> 01:04:24.115
What secrets they know on you?

01:04:26.179 --> 01:04:28.191
About what you speak to me?

01:04:31.761 --> 01:04:34.007
What's up between you and Amjad?

01:05:47.195 --> 01:05:49.395
Give this number to Amjad and ask him

01:05:49.515 --> 01:05:51.471
to tell me where I can find him..

01:05:51.915 --> 01:05:55.464
Omar, please do not come back here any more.

01:06:00.635 --> 01:06:02.990
<i>to listen to your messages, type 1.</i>

01:06:06.275 --> 01:06:07.708
<i>You have no message.</i>

01:07:12.048 --> 01:07:14.315
- How did you find me?
- your sisters.

01:07:14.435 --> 01:07:15.709
They are doing well?

01:07:16.315 --> 01:07:18.112
You go to speak to them often...

01:07:18.595 --> 01:07:21.985
Very well. They doing very well.
They ask for your news.

01:07:22.595 --> 01:07:25.905
They make a special bargain:
A bought product, two giving.

01:07:34.931 --> 01:07:37.275
You betrayed us!
To steal from me Nadia!

01:07:37.395 --> 01:07:39.115
It is just like that they knew that I liked it

01:07:39.235 --> 01:07:40.965
and where Tarek and me were!

01:07:41.085 --> 01:07:43.875
- I am not the only one in...
- Say the truth.

01:07:43.995 --> 01:07:46.509
Or I swear in front of God to kill you pronto!

01:07:46.629 --> 01:07:49.348
- It is me who killed the soldier.
- and they want Tarek?

01:07:49.468 --> 01:07:51.395
You said to them that it was him!

01:07:51.515 --> 01:07:53.358
It is what they want.
That they become paranoid.

01:07:55.475 --> 01:07:57.470
You spit out the piece, yes or not?

01:07:58.475 --> 01:07:59.828
Speak! Speak!

01:08:06.010 --> 01:08:07.359
Yes, it is me.

01:08:10.875 --> 01:08:11.990
Why?

01:08:12.875 --> 01:08:14.627
How could you do this?

01:08:16.555 --> 01:08:18.118
How? How?

01:08:18.238 --> 01:08:20.915
If you still lie,
I shall kill you whatever happens.

01:08:21.035 --> 01:08:22.381
Why did you tell them about Nadia?

01:08:22.555 --> 01:08:24.830
Hussam had spoken to them.

01:08:25.357 --> 01:08:28.148
Hussam had died the 2nd time, speak!

01:08:31.615 --> 01:08:32.854
Speak!

01:08:34.795 --> 01:08:37.343
- What did you tell on Nadia?
- she is pregnant from me.

01:08:54.875 --> 01:08:58.345
They are dead both if she does not have an abortion.

01:09:00.154 --> 01:09:01.424
But the police officers knew it

01:09:03.194 --> 01:09:04.674
and threatened me:

01:09:05.675 --> 01:09:08.875
If I did not collaborate, they would say everything.

01:09:08.995 --> 01:09:11.448
They would be dead both.

01:09:11.848 --> 01:09:12.795
Dead!

01:09:12.915 --> 01:09:14.348
Liar!

01:09:26.890 --> 01:09:28.358
It is not her fault.

01:09:31.755 --> 01:09:33.946
If you kill me, she will also die.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:23.890 --> 01:10:25.314
But how...

01:10:26.759 --> 01:10:28.757
How could she do this?

01:10:47.487 --> 01:10:49.144
It is necessary that they go see Tarek.

01:10:50.035 --> 01:10:52.151
- I am not going.
- need you to go.

01:10:52.271 --> 01:10:55.591
- Understand Me, I am going there.
- you don't have a choice.

01:10:56.955 --> 01:10:58.245
I am not going there.

01:11:00.382 --> 01:11:02.303
Understand Me, I am not going there.

01:11:02.475 --> 01:11:04.591
- He is going to kill me.
- He should.

01:11:18.075 --> 01:11:19.645
He can not do it.

01:11:21.039 --> 01:11:24.077
He is my childhood friend and Nadia is her sister...

01:11:29.835 --> 01:11:30.955
I shall be with you,

01:11:31.075 --> 01:11:33.225
I shall not let it happen, you are evil.

01:11:52.955 --> 01:11:54.991
- What happened?
- an accident.

01:12:08.155 --> 01:12:09.595
Leave Us, guys.

01:12:09.715 --> 01:12:10.864
Let us walk.

01:12:17.691 --> 01:12:20.350
Each time I see you, I am trapped.

01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:24.593
How did it go for you this time?

01:12:24.713 --> 01:12:27.189
by assuring them that you would collaborate?

01:12:27.309 --> 01:12:31.104
You want to roll them?
You think that they are stupid?

01:12:31.224 --> 01:12:34.115
I had to know who had betrayed us.

01:12:34.235 --> 01:12:36.305
Who betrayed us?
You have what in the leg?

01:12:36.425 --> 01:12:39.831
An gps device. They find me wherever I am.

01:12:41.049 --> 01:12:42.995
Which one of you is the traitor?

01:12:43.115 --> 01:12:45.496
They forced Amjad to reveal the trap.

01:12:57.137 --> 01:13:00.028
I did not have answer,
I thought that youwere you one of them.

01:13:02.915 --> 01:13:04.116
Tarek.

01:13:07.915 --> 01:13:09.394
Amjad made an error.

01:13:12.355 --> 01:13:13.834
An error with Nadia.

01:13:17.936 --> 01:13:19.474
Nadia is pregnant from him.

01:13:22.877 --> 01:13:24.707
Which only means, she is to marry him.

01:13:27.556 --> 01:13:29.704
- I am going to kill you!
- No!

01:13:30.490 --> 01:13:33.235
- Tarek, please, stops!
- Drop me!

01:13:33.355 --> 01:13:35.591
- I am going to kill you!
- Tarek !

01:13:35.711 --> 01:13:37.295
If you kill him, it is Nadia which will pay!

01:13:37.415 --> 01:13:38.464
I am going to kill you!

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:40.372
It is not her error!

01:13:49.978 --> 01:13:51.057
Tarek...

01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:37.928
Recover the apparatus.

01:14:41.627 --> 01:14:42.789
The guys...

01:14:43.407 --> 01:14:44.995
they will never forget this.

01:14:45.768 --> 01:14:48.056
If you need, of whatever it is...

01:14:48.176 --> 01:14:50.058
They want nothing from you.

01:14:52.401 --> 01:14:55.870
Keep the body two months before announcing her arrest.

01:14:56.955 --> 01:14:58.538
Why two months?

01:14:59.119 --> 01:15:01.007
The time to clear my name.

01:15:39.435 --> 01:15:42.910
Mister, they are coming to ask for the hand of Nadia for Amjad.

01:15:52.195 --> 01:15:53.373
Is he ready?

01:15:53.759 --> 01:15:56.205
Has he enough silver for a home

01:15:56.945 --> 01:15:58.631
and the maintenance of a family?

01:15:59.347 --> 01:16:00.469
Yes.

01:16:21.435 --> 01:16:22.998
It is necessary that they ask Tarek.

01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:27.271
They asked him and he accepted.

01:16:27.818 --> 01:16:30.030
They know all the reasons for his absence.

01:16:31.355 --> 01:16:33.391
It is necessary that I ask Nadia.

01:16:41.555 --> 01:16:43.147
What do you think of her, my daughter?

01:16:50.970 --> 01:16:52.628
Decision is yours.

01:16:59.075 --> 01:17:00.190
Fine.

01:17:01.637 --> 01:17:02.727
Very well.

01:17:23.489 --> 01:17:25.567
In his birth, you will say that the infant is premature.

01:18:43.595 --> 01:18:45.108
Why you cry?

01:18:45.995 --> 01:18:47.967
Because you do not cry, you.

01:18:48.738 --> 01:18:51.269
As from today, they do not know themselves any more.

01:19:29.915 --> 01:19:31.328
Muhsen Ali-Taha,

01:19:31.835 --> 01:19:34.475
new leader of the brigade of Jerusalem.
Can we talk?

01:19:34.595 --> 01:19:35.647
Certainly.

01:19:36.847 --> 01:19:38.302
What do you know about Amjad Haleem?

01:19:39.315 --> 01:19:40.510
On what subject?

01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:42.554
What did it do in the resistance?

01:19:42.674 --> 01:19:45.035
He agreed with Tarek Abd-AI Salam?

01:19:45.155 --> 01:19:49.017
- What is problem exactly?
- they have questions still unanswered.

01:19:51.129 --> 01:19:53.355
You were stopped.
How did you get out so quickly?

01:19:53.475 --> 01:19:56.353
I said nothing, and they did not have proof against me.

01:19:57.275 --> 01:19:59.266
Why Amjad was not ever stopped?

01:20:00.315 --> 01:20:02.146
What is that got to do with me?

01:20:02.548 --> 01:20:04.915
You can perhaps help us to solve mystery.

01:20:05.130 --> 01:20:06.495
What mystery?

01:20:07.355 --> 01:20:10.825
The body of Tarek was frozen for more than two months,

01:20:11.795 --> 01:20:13.751
according to our forensic surgeon.

01:20:14.755 --> 01:20:17.747
last time they saw him alive, he was with you and Amjad.

01:20:19.314 --> 01:20:20.414
And then?

01:20:23.150 --> 01:20:25.648
How has Amjad money to get married?

01:20:25.768 --> 01:20:27.193
How did it happen?

01:20:28.197 --> 01:20:29.867
I know nothing about him.

01:20:31.330 --> 01:20:33.994
I did not see him for 2 years.
And I have no opinion of him..

01:20:34.114 --> 01:20:35.197
I know.

01:20:35.630 --> 01:20:38.475
They wonder definitely what took place between you.

01:20:38.595 --> 01:20:41.155
You were friends of childhood, no?

01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:44.151
It is personal.
It is not your business.

01:20:44.555 --> 01:20:46.228
Very well, Omar.

01:20:47.195 --> 01:20:48.685
They will find well without you.

01:20:49.229 --> 01:20:51.057
And the culprit will be punished.

01:21:10.995 --> 01:21:13.190
A plain round flat cake with sesame, please.

01:21:18.915 --> 01:21:20.314
five shekels.

01:21:37.486 --> 01:21:38.947
You want what?

01:21:39.515 --> 01:21:42.115
- Why are you so hostile?
- what you want?

01:21:44.355 --> 01:21:45.947
You will never change.

01:21:48.995 --> 01:21:51.350
They want to find Muhsen Ali-Taha.

01:21:56.235 --> 01:21:58.162
I do not think that you have the choice.

01:21:59.917 --> 01:22:02.867
They know that he enquires on your subject.

01:22:03.806 --> 01:22:06.946
do not forget, they can protect you from him.

01:22:08.894 --> 01:22:09.924
Or...

01:22:10.875 --> 01:22:12.195
they can destroy you.

01:22:12.315 --> 01:22:13.507
You, Amjad...

01:22:14.958 --> 01:22:16.187
and Nadia.

01:22:20.075 --> 01:22:23.784
You know what is going to happen if Nadia learns the truth?

01:23:05.795 --> 01:23:08.548
It is not serious, small.
Get up, this is going to go.

01:23:53.395 --> 01:23:54.748
Where is Amjad?

01:23:56.595 --> 01:23:58.877
He should be back in any moment..

01:23:59.755 --> 01:24:01.634
You can wait in the living room.

01:24:20.875 --> 01:24:23.867
I do not want to be indiscreet, but How are you doing?

01:24:26.195 --> 01:24:27.992
Very well. And you?

01:24:29.955 --> 01:24:31.590
You continued your studies?

01:24:33.468 --> 01:24:37.030
Yes, but I must have stopped to be in charge of children.

01:24:37.675 --> 01:24:39.628
I am gifted in this material.

01:24:44.155 --> 01:24:46.669
I shall resume when they will be bigger.

01:24:49.955 --> 01:24:52.071
- How is he called?
- Tarek.

01:24:56.446 --> 01:24:58.724
- And the younger?
- Abla.

01:25:00.235 --> 01:25:01.793
They have what age?

01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:06.007
Tarek was born After the decease of my brother one year exactly.

01:25:07.353 --> 01:25:08.675
Abla is two months old.

01:25:10.675 --> 01:25:12.352
He was not premature?

01:25:13.275 --> 01:25:15.391
No, why? That God blesses him.

01:25:41.975 --> 01:25:43.581
Why did you not propose me?

01:25:45.469 --> 01:25:47.312
Why have you said yes to Amjad?

01:25:50.046 --> 01:25:53.106
I thought that you did not want me
because I was an idiot.

01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:56.396
I was disappointed, recreancy earned me

01:25:59.499 --> 01:26:01.471
and life exceeded me....

01:26:05.617 --> 01:26:06.829
Omar,

01:26:07.275 --> 01:26:08.788
I am sorry.

01:26:16.955 --> 01:26:18.911
How could I be afraid of you

01:26:20.115 --> 01:26:22.675
and think that you could be a traitor?

01:26:30.689 --> 01:26:33.607
I wonder how I could be also stupid.

01:26:36.518 --> 01:26:38.596
They all believed in the unthinkable.

01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:49.993
I tried to apologize,

01:26:52.995 --> 01:26:54.667
but you refused to listen.

01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:58.273
I sent a letter with Amjad, you did not answer...

01:27:02.455 --> 01:27:06.154
I understand. I imagine to what extent you were angered.

01:27:11.626 --> 01:27:14.664
I dropped you at the time when you more needed me.

01:27:18.806 --> 01:27:20.574
It is me who left you.

01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:26.248
I am Sorry.

01:27:32.595 --> 01:27:34.426
You always have my letters?

01:27:39.555 --> 01:27:41.193
I kept yours.

01:28:22.158 --> 01:28:25.516
- <i>Tarek did not kill the soldier.</i>
- <i>It was because?</i>

01:28:26.055 --> 01:28:29.515
- <i>His name in exchange for a revolver.</i>
- <i>Why?</i>

01:28:29.635 --> 01:28:31.345
A personal affair.

01:28:32.179 --> 01:28:33.995
<i>That would you do it, Omar?</i>

01:28:34.115 --> 01:28:36.788
Bring Me in one and I deliver you the murderer.

01:28:37.955 --> 01:28:39.817
<i>And Muhsen Ali-Taha ?</i>

01:28:41.709 --> 01:28:42.992
They will speak.

01:28:44.188 --> 01:28:46.768
Swear to me you will not touch Amjad.

01:28:46.888 --> 01:28:49.349
Leave him to me. I am in charge of him..

01:28:53.395 --> 01:28:54.545
Fine.

01:29:58.137 --> 01:29:59.715
Greeting, Omar.

01:29:59.835 --> 01:30:02.065
- How are you doing?
- Well, Thank God!

01:30:02.938 --> 01:30:03.791
You want it?

01:30:14.075 --> 01:30:14.919
Take Them.

01:30:22.966 --> 01:30:26.206
- This is not held just like that.
- I have never used it.

01:30:26.326 --> 01:30:28.391
You show me how are you getting it on?

01:30:33.675 --> 01:30:37.926
First, a revolver, it is like a woman.

01:30:38.391 --> 01:30:41.347
If you are nice to it, it will be nice to you.

01:30:46.127 --> 01:30:49.067
Support thereupon and withdraw the loader.

01:30:52.258 --> 01:30:56.307
Take bullets, go downwards and re-launch.

01:31:03.047 --> 01:31:05.895
With your left hand, you load the revolver.

01:31:19.370 --> 01:31:20.794
Who killed the soldier?

01:31:21.915 --> 01:31:23.587
Can I try?

01:31:39.639 --> 01:31:41.232
- Rami...
- Yes?

01:31:43.507 --> 01:31:46.068
You know how they catch the monkey in Africa?
