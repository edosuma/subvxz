<i> course I have heard of him </ i></i>

01:46.000 --> 01:47.600
<i> like all hunters. </ i></i>

01:49.100 --> 01:52.300
<i> It was the time that people
still feared dragons. </ i></i>

01:58.900 --> 02:03.300
<i> As a boy he learned to hunt,
traps and snares be placed </ i></i>

02:04.800 --> 02:07.000
<i> for himself and his sister alive. </ i></i>

02:17.100 --> 02:19.000
<i> But then one day ...</ i></i>

02:21.100 --> 02:23.700
<i> the beast came near Kinatra. </ i></i>

02:29.400 --> 02:33.000
<i> An animal larger than any dragon
I've ever seen. </ i></i>

02:34.300 --> 02:37.700
<i> Altered in one go
future of the young Ahab. </ i></i>

04:31.400 --> 04:35.400
<i> When you see such a huge beast,
would frighten even the bravest man. </ i></i>

04:37.000 --> 04:40.200
<i> He challenged the beast with all his might </ i></i>

04:40.900 --> 04:43.600
<i> and took him to ...
again and again. </ i></i>

05:04.300 --> 05:06.300
<i> How he escaped alive nobody knows. </ i></i>

05:07.100 --> 05:09.200
<i> His face and body burned. </ i></i>

05:09.700 --> 05:12.200
<i> Some say the dragon
deliberately left him alive. </ i></i>

05:12.300 --> 05:14.400
<i> Others say he has gone mad </ i></i>

05:15.200 --> 05:17.600
<i> and his soul has lost that day. </ i></i>

05:33.100 --> 05:36.500
<i> It was the story that made me Ahab
incentive for this trip ...</ i></i>

05:36.700 --> 05:40.900
<i> we beaches on Kovinstown
this rainy evening. </ i></i>

05:42.400 --> 05:43.800
Fisherman?

05:44.000 --> 05:45.400
So you may call me.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.500
And the native name of your friend?

05:47.600 --> 05:50.400
Queequeg, his father was a great warrior.

05:50.900 --> 05:54.700
His name and his soul strains
from great fighters.

05:55.900 --> 05:58.000
It is his face that tells a story.

05:58.500 --> 06:01.300
If he can handle a thousand devils.

06:01.400 --> 06:04.100
That he might, he has never
gone sideways for a fight.

06:04.300 --> 06:08.000
He always has some on hand?

06:11.400 --> 06:14.700
Another round.
- You're a good man?

06:15.200 --> 06:17.000
Well tell me about yourself.

06:18.400 --> 06:23.800
A wanderer an orphan,
the blood began to boil inside me ...

06:24.100 --> 06:27.300
so I figured it's time
to move on.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.300
Ah, an adventurer.

06:29.700 --> 06:32.100
I guess I'm curious
all things in the world.

06:32.200 --> 06:34.900
A poet!

06:35.300 --> 06:37.600
Why are you here looking for Ahab?

06:39.100 --> 06:41.200
I've heard that here
can register ...

06:41.400 --> 06:42.300
to hunt dragons.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.300
Together with the hunters to work

06:44.500 --> 06:47.800
and for us to join Ahab.

06:52.700 --> 06:54.600
It's true ...

06:55.400 --> 06:58.000
the world is run by Dragon Oil.

06:58.400 --> 07:01.300
And the city is the marketplace
for all traders.

07:05.500 --> 07:08.500
Why the cursed man?

07:08.600 --> 07:10.900
He is the best known of the dragon hunters.

07:11.400 --> 07:14.100
That's it ...
that he is, my friend.

07:14.900 --> 07:17.300
Want to tell me,
that you're a harpooner?

07:18.000 --> 07:19.600
Yes, that's me.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.100
Ballast for me!

07:23.100 --> 07:25.600
Is there any ballast, Mr. Starbuck?

07:26.400 --> 07:29.000
We are all ballast, Mr. Stubb.

07:33.700 --> 07:35.400
But to hunt together with Ahab ...

07:35.800 --> 07:38.600
you must answer to God.

07:38.700 --> 07:41.200
Then you have the best harpooner
world.

07:43.300 --> 07:45.600
Are you sure
you're a harpooner?

07:47.900 --> 07:50.100
He's just a fresh beginner.

07:50.900 --> 07:54.500
And you're a fat pig skinned
should be for Easter.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.700
Calm down, Mr.. Floss.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.400
Let's see if he
truth.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
A match.

08:06.800 --> 08:09.000
This is good enough.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.300
What do you, Mr.. Starbuck?

08:13.800 --> 08:17.400
Would you harpoon it, the dragon
could throw?

08:18.800 --> 08:21.100
You're always worth the
Mr. betting. Stubb.

08:23.100 --> 08:25.500
Let's see how good your poor, boy.

08:33.799 --> 08:37.299
Let us pass.
On the side I told you!

08:38.799 --> 08:41.600
The large white dragon Ahab's legend.

08:42.700 --> 08:45.200
Means you meet him dead.

08:45.300 --> 08:48.700
Except, of course, old Ahab.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.300
Mr. Starbuck, give the boy a harpoon.

08:54.900 --> 08:56.900
I already have one.

09:04.700 --> 09:06.700
A little small?

09:07.200 --> 09:08.400
Okay, Mr. Floss.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.500
Go my way.

09:23.500 --> 09:25.100
Can you beat that?

09:39.100 --> 09:40.500
Good shot.

09:41.900 --> 09:45.200
Well that's something you
not see every day, Mr.. Stubb.

09:46.200 --> 09:47.900
True enough, Mr.. Starbuck.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.700
Well done.

10:00.200 --> 10:04.200
Tell me how this thing works.

10:05.500 --> 10:08.700
It makes the harpoon faster, and ...
- It was just luck.

10:09.200 --> 10:13.100
How are you with a knife?
- Enough!

10:16.200 --> 10:18.200
Whoever it may or not be?

10:19.700 --> 10:23.700
The child of the devil himself.
- Go away drunk.

10:26.300 --> 10:28.800
This is Ahab's daughter, Rachel.

10:30.200 --> 10:33.200
Would you use it against me?
- No.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.200
But if you want to register
the team ...

10:39.000 --> 10:40.500
sign here!

10:40.500 --> 10:43.000
Rachel, I told you ...
- Quiet, you're just an instructor ...

10:43.200 --> 10:45.400
remember that!

10:48.300 --> 10:51.000
You will compete as
the rest of the group ...

10:51.300 --> 10:53.600
in an equal share of the profits.

10:53.700 --> 10:55.200
There are plenty of hunters ...

10:56.100 --> 10:58.700
but not many dare to take
against dragons.

11:00.700 --> 11:02.900
The work is overrated.

11:12.300 --> 11:15.600
A toast to one hundred dragons for Piquat.

11:16.100 --> 11:18.900
Piquat ...
- Piquat, Piquat ...

11:19.000 --> 11:22.700
Rachel?
He goes with me!

11:35.600 --> 11:37.400
Are you sure
it's safe here?

11:37.500 --> 11:40.000
Believe me
I do not need your protection.

11:42.500 --> 11:44.300
We were just leaving anyway.

11:51.800 --> 11:54.000
If that is Ahab's daughter.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.100
Or should I say, Ahab's whore?

11:58.000 --> 12:01.800
You see what scum
nowadays you will find on the street.

12:02.100 --> 12:04.700
We were never good enough
for you to hunt?

12:05.400 --> 12:06.500
Go back!

12:06.800 --> 12:11.400
Tastico, you were not even good enough
the shit out of the vehicle.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.300
Stay out!

12:46.100 --> 12:48.300
Be at sunrise at the departure point,

12:48.400 --> 12:50.200
and party too much.

13:17.700 --> 13:20.300
Hey look it's that old man from the city.

13:24.200 --> 13:28.800
You're the one who needs salvation.

13:33.500 --> 13:37.900
I've seen the book signing.

13:38.800 --> 13:43.400
Have not you heard what I said,
the writing of your souls?

13:44.700 --> 13:47.700
Maybe you have no soul.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.500
Let's go ...

13:52.200 --> 13:53.700
his thoughts are broken.

13:55.100 --> 13:58.200
You have not seen that old devil?

14:00.400 --> 14:01.500
Old devil?

14:02.800 --> 14:06.100
Have I not told
how he was dragged to hell ...

14:06.300 --> 14:10.300
and dragged everyone
on his path of revenge?

14:10.500 --> 14:15.500
His face, his soul,
and torn skin forever.

14:17.900 --> 14:21.100
What's your name?
- Elijah.

14:23.200 --> 14:27.600
And believe me, boy,
but one man will survive,

14:27.800 --> 14:32.700
to Ahab's story to tell.
But a man!

15:11.400 --> 15:13.200
Ah, the adventurers.

15:14.700 --> 15:16.100
So you show up?

15:16.700 --> 15:19.100
Just in time for stocks
bring onboard.

15:20.600 --> 15:22.700
Starbuck! I want to rest.

15:30.200 --> 15:32.300
What is the story of your friend there?

15:33.900 --> 15:37.000
Especially ...
I have known him a long time.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.400
How long you been hunting with this team?

15:41.100 --> 15:42.700
About eight years.

15:43.400 --> 15:46.900
We already have a lot of money.
But again issued.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.300
I have been married three times.

15:51.300 --> 15:54.400
She left ...
I left them all laughing.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.000
They asked me to come back ...

16:01.600 --> 16:04.100
but of course I did not.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.700
Have you ever fought with the white dragon ...

16:11.100 --> 16:13.600
where Ahab is all his life back?

16:14.600 --> 16:16.600
This beast is really bad!

16:16.700 --> 16:21.800
They say he brings death
to the people. Really bad.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
The whole team has Ahab's murder
the last time ...

16:26.100 --> 16:27.400
that she came face.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.400
When I signed.

16:31.100 --> 16:33.900
But no boy
I'm never seen.

16:34.200 --> 16:37.600
And I pray God that I never do.

16:42.100 --> 16:45.500
It is better for you that old
metal monster now bless ...

16:46.500 --> 16:48.500
because it will be your home for a while.

16:50.400 --> 16:55.200
Come on let's not hang around
the rest on board.

16:57.900 --> 17:02.100
<i> The vehicle is a strange long Piquat
weatherproof vehicle. </ i></i>

17:03.500 --> 17:06.800
<i> screed rings hull protects us </ i></i>

17:07.000 --> 17:10.400
<i> from the fire of the dragon. </ i></i>

17:30.500 --> 17:33.200
<i> But nothing is invincible. </ i></i>

17:36.700 --> 17:38.700
We moved <i> inaccessible
documents prohibited countries, </ i></i>

17:38.900 --> 17:44.100
<i> looking dragon oil
the best of all oils. </ i></i>

17:45.200 --> 17:48.300
<i> And all the lights in our world

The size is <i> boss Starbuck. </ i></i>

<i> earned a trusted man

18:02.100 --> 18:05.700
<i> And he does continue

18:05.900 --> 18:07.900
<i> Even when his wife and children
died of a serious illness. </ i></i>

18:14.500 --> 18:16.400
<i> If you looked into his eyes you saw
how much pain </ i></i>

18:16.500 --> 18:18.500
<i> he faced. </ i></i>

18:22.300 --> 18:23.300
He knew many areas <i> ...</ i></i>

18:23.400 --> 18:27.600
<i> and a fearless man is more dangerous
than a coward. </ i></i>

18:31.700 --> 18:33.400
<i> Stubb, his second size. </ i></i>

18:33.600 --> 18:36.100
He was lucky and captured <i>
the Northern Valley. </ i></i>

18:37.400 --> 18:39.900
<i> You do not have to worry,
if it is in place. </ i></i>

18:40.400 --> 18:42.500
<i> He controlled most deadly harpoons </ i></i>

18:42.600 --> 18:45.100
<i> as if it were dinner parties. </ i></i>

18:52.400 --> 18:56.200
<i> Resistant to fire, and more
rope than any else. </ i></i>

18:56.600 --> 18:59.700
<i> With this, we are ready to attack. </ i></i>

19:06.100 --> 19:08.200
<i> Flask was one big vicious inspiring man </ i></i>

19:08.300 --> 19:10.200
<i> with a hardened soul. </ i></i>

19:10.300 --> 19:12.400
<i> He was the more abstract </ i></i>

19:12.600 --> 19:15.000
<i> and removes the entrails and the abstract </ i></i>

19:15.200 --> 19:17.100
<i> from the dragon's throat. </ i></i>

19:19.900 --> 19:21.800
<i> He was also our cook. </ i></i>

19:22.400 --> 19:24.000
<i> And a very bad cook too. </ i></i>

19:37.700 --> 19:39.700
Then there is <i>, Rachel. </ i></i>

19:40.000 --> 19:41.900
<i> Always the captains daughter. </ i></i>

19:42.600 --> 19:45.900
Always <i> into themselves and hard,
if they never be broken. </ i></i>

19:53.200 --> 19:55.800
I gotta show you something.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.700
The world runs on this fluid.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.500
It's just before we
market to sell.

20:04.600 --> 20:08.800
If it comes into contact with air
it will explode.

20:26.000 --> 20:30.800
But our boss and dictator <i> have
I have not seen. </ i></i>

20:38.300 --> 20:40.700
<i> He sits in his cabin cold bent
his cards ...</ i></i>

20:40.900 --> 20:44.800
<i> made and full of notes
conquests of his long years. </ i></i>

20:45.700 --> 20:47.900
Every morning he <i> Rachel
the course to follow. </ i></i>

20:50.200 --> 20:52.400
<i> because he stays within his skin. </ i></i>

20:52.900 --> 20:55.900
<i> If he comes in the daylight,
he must be completely covered. </ i></i>

21:00.500 --> 21:03.500
<i> Every night we share a meal together. </ i></i>

21:12.100 --> 21:14.400
The food is bad.

21:22.300 --> 21:25.100
I think you have feelings
Lens damage.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.200
Tell us a story Mr. Stubb.

21:32.400 --> 21:35.000
You have all my stories
heard, Mr. Starbuck.

21:35.300 --> 21:36.300
Not me.

21:37.400 --> 21:39.300
Well, I remember my first hunt.

21:42.100 --> 21:44.100
On a beautiful woman with ...

21:44.600 --> 21:47.400
No, you gave us that all too often told.

21:49.900 --> 21:52.100
Tell us a story dragon Rachel.

21:53.500 --> 21:56.100
Well ...
Tell them about the fight with Vadamoica.

22:07.700 --> 22:12.500
Before I signed with Ahab
I was first to measure a vehicle ...

22:13.100 --> 22:16.300
Vadamoica called.

22:17.900 --> 22:19.300
I was young.

22:20.300 --> 22:24.200
It was before the dragons,
came to the woods and fields.

22:26.800 --> 22:29.400
When you first turn on your dragon spear
to throw ...

22:29.500 --> 22:32.500
are you shaking with fear.

22:33.900 --> 22:35.600
You stand there ...

22:37.800 --> 22:41.400
and the weight of your
harpoon feels like 40 pounds.

22:42.600 --> 22:45.400
You're shaking in your shoes

22:46.500 --> 22:48.600
and when you throw your spear
it feels ...

22:48.600 --> 22:51.000
or your lungs explode.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.200
A man fought with me ...
a good man.

22:55.400 --> 22:59.300
You remember him
or not Mr. Starbuck?

23:00.000 --> 23:01.100
Yes.

23:01.600 --> 23:05.600
Burning,
in a flash by the breath of the dragon.

23:06.500 --> 23:08.500
His skin was roasted ...
black and pink before our eyes.

23:13.600 --> 23:16.600
He shriveled down to his knees ...

23:17.500 --> 23:21.600
he was screaming for me
throw throw ... he yelled.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.500
And with the power of Almighty God,

23:26.100 --> 23:29.300
I threw my spear at the beast.

23:31.200 --> 23:34.300
Hit him right here ...
well embedded in his skin.

23:36.100 --> 23:40.600
He collapsed and was
a final battle ...

23:40.800 --> 23:43.000
its wings.

23:44.300 --> 23:47.500
I heard a cry of joy
right for us.

23:48.100 --> 23:51.500
I do not know where
came from boys ...

23:52.700 --> 23:56.500
Despite his pain looked
Whitman on to me ...

23:57.100 --> 23:58.800
and laughed.

24:01.200 --> 24:04.300
He had seen the pitch before he died.

24:06.600 --> 24:11.100
And that was the story of a dragon hunter.

24:17.800 --> 24:21.900
At Whitman.
On Withman a fine man.

24:27.900 --> 24:31.000
Well, boy let me now first
story ...

24:31.100 --> 24:34.800
of that beauty with thick ...

24:42.500 --> 24:45.000
Every night after <i> Stubb's stories
we went to bed </ i></i>

24:45.100 --> 24:47.000
<i> safe in the belly of the vehicle. </ i></i>

25:49.400 --> 25:52.400
<i> I wondered in what strange adventure
I had arrived. </ i></i>

25:53.200 --> 25:56.800
<i> what constituted for me ...
in this journey. </ i></i>

25:57.300 --> 26:00.600
<i> days of my life
wasted by killing. </ i></i>

26:01.000 --> 26:04.500
<i> that's what I hear from Ahab. </ i></i>

26:05.300 --> 26:08.100
<i> running up and down on the deck at night. </ i></i>

26:08.200 --> 26:11.000
<i> Always looking for the dragon who opjoeg. </ i></i>

26:19.400 --> 26:24.100
<i> And then came the day that he knew
that he had to inspect our souls. </ i></i>

26:48.600 --> 26:52.700
Mr. Starbuck? Gather the team.

26:53.900 --> 26:55.600
Rachel get the drink.

27:48.400 --> 27:53.300
Tomorrow we will arrive on the battlefield.

27:53.600 --> 27:56.600
You will all be rich
after this hunt.

28:01.300 --> 28:04.400
But listen to me!

28:04.800 --> 28:08.600
I will double the amount
the first man ...

28:09.100 --> 28:12.000
that impales the white dragon.

28:12.500 --> 28:15.100
No, I triple the amount.

28:17.200 --> 28:22.400
Keep your eyes open and observe.
- Captain?

28:22.900 --> 28:26.700
Was not the white dragon
that you burned?

28:27.600 --> 28:29.100
Cripple you made?

28:35.700 --> 28:39.300
Yes. - Mr. Starbuck.

28:40.500 --> 28:43.600
You know all too well that
the cursed beast it was.

28:43.800 --> 28:48.200
And I will hunt him about any hill.

28:48.800 --> 28:52.800
Even by hellfire
that's what we need to do ...

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
the white dragon detection impale ...

28:56.200 --> 28:59.200
He spits up black blood.

28:59.300 --> 29:01.600
Do you understand?
- Yes. - Yes. - Yes.

29:01.800 --> 29:07.200
Captain, you know very well
I dare my life.

29:07.500 --> 29:11.900
But I also came to hunt
and rich. Not for Adventure.

29:12.300 --> 29:15.600
How many lives have your revenge
whether or not cost?

29:15.700 --> 29:18.100
You do not reproach me.

29:18.500 --> 29:20.600
I did what I wanted
and I do what I want.

29:27.100 --> 29:30.600
That damned beast has cluttered up
with blind rage.

29:31.100 --> 29:35.400
To seek revenge on such a sample is crazy.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.800
Go ahead call me crazy ...

29:37.900 --> 29:42.500
I would still chase the sun
he would offend me.

29:42.700 --> 29:45.300
Rachel bring the drinks!

29:47.900 --> 29:53.400
Drink and swear peer
chase the white dragon ...

29:53.700 --> 29:57.200
until his death.
Now drinking Harpo down managers.

29:59.300 --> 30:02.200
Well done, almost excellent.

30:15.100 --> 30:15.900
Now, Mr. Starbuck!

31:19.800 --> 31:22.800
It was Rachel who <i> us
led to the drakenhol. </ i></i>

31:28.900 --> 31:33.000
<i> She had half a sense gift
dragons to detect. </ i></i>

31:44.300 --> 31:48.800
<i> It was my fear that I or one,
Another way was to get under control. </ i></i>

31:49.000 --> 31:54.300
<i> Fear freezes you ...
paralysis of spirit and brains. </ i></i>

31:55.800 --> 31:59.500
<i> I tried to find them but I
never seen a dragon. </ i></i>

32:07.700 --> 32:08.700
Stubb!

32:10.800 --> 32:12.200
I got it.

32:18.900 --> 32:20.700
Hey, get.

32:25.400 --> 32:28.800
Throw throw now, what are you waiting for?

32:28.900 --> 32:30.600
Throw your harpoon.

32:31.700 --> 32:33.600
Step out and throw guy.

32:35.100 --> 32:37.100
Stubb, swim away!

33:15.400 --> 33:17.200
Starbuck get this off me.

33:20.200 --> 33:22.600
Ishmael throw!

33:28.400 --> 33:30.500
I grabbed him and go back Starbuck.

33:33.800 --> 33:37.400
Want my dirty bastard?

35:46.600 --> 35:49.600
Now you are against any animal cope.

35:52.300 --> 35:53.600
Aside.

36:56.800 --> 36:59.200
His pipe went out anyway.
Goodbye best Stubb.

37:01.200 --> 37:02.900
He loved life.

37:03.400 --> 37:05.100
Laughing at life.

37:05.700 --> 37:07.700
You told me this
the only answer ...

37:07.700 --> 37:09.200
at all strange.

37:10.400 --> 37:14.700
We hunted together in faraway countries wanted.

37:15.100 --> 37:20.700
He did not
he loved hunting.

37:21.700 --> 37:24.700
Now he sits at the dinner
together with the devil.

37:25.400 --> 37:30.300
I think we all eventually
Rachel will do.

38:25.500 --> 38:28.500
Captain?
- Come in, Mr.. Starbuck.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.300
How's the crew?

38:33.700 --> 38:36.600
Mourning for the loss of Stubb.

38:37.700 --> 38:41.900
That is the risk of your profession Mr. Starbuck.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.700
You live your life as you want.

38:45.900 --> 38:49.700
Yes, but ...
- You do it included with death.

38:50.700 --> 38:55.100
Is your lovely wife or daughter
ever returned ...

38:55.200 --> 38:57.300
in order to console you?

38:58.200 --> 39:00.300
No, Captain.

39:00.700 --> 39:02.700
And they will not.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.200
So forget those memories
the last battlefield.

39:15.500 --> 39:18.300
I've hunted all my life dragons.

39:18.900 --> 39:21.200
I know and can feel
my hand that we are close.

39:35.600 --> 39:38.000
We can load up our car
with fuel,

39:38.100 --> 39:41.200
and are back for spring.

39:41.300 --> 39:44.600
Not until we have completed
the bigger things.

39:45.900 --> 39:51.100
He goes northward to the mountains to
to get clogs.

39:52.400 --> 39:55.400
It moves faster
than in other years.

39:56.200 --> 39:59.900
Centuries, as it feels for me.

40:04.100 --> 40:08.100
I'll show you where we
have an appointment.

40:20.800 --> 40:23.600
You had to throw earlier.

40:25.700 --> 40:28.200
On Mr.. Stubb.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.900
He's right, I had
overdue throw.

40:38.300 --> 40:42.900
You impaled by the dragon's heart
Stubb's what it wants to remember.

40:46.300 --> 40:49.700
Does not he drink?
- He prefers his pipe.

40:51.700 --> 40:54.400
He is at peace with his soul.

40:55.400 --> 40:57.600
You know each other already?

40:58.700 --> 41:01.200
Yes we have traveled the world together.

41:02.800 --> 41:04.600
Seen a lot.

41:05.100 --> 41:07.000
Mysterious and strange.

41:09.500 --> 41:11.800
But nothing is like today ...

41:13.400 --> 41:18.000
or as a woman, as you.

41:21.300 --> 41:26.500
Forgive me.
I have too much to drink.

41:31.200 --> 41:33.300
Hold on!

41:38.600 --> 41:42.000
And will I ever hear your story?

41:45.500 --> 41:50.200
My mother died at my birth.

41:51.900 --> 41:54.000
My father was slain when I was eight.

41:55.100 --> 41:58.700
For Ahab, Starbuck was my father's
first measure.

42:00.300 --> 42:03.100
In the mountains they came
the white dragon ...

42:03.200 --> 42:06.100
Ahab told me that my father,

42:06.400 --> 42:07.600
who first pitched.

42:07.700 --> 42:10.000
He threw a harpoon straight into the beast.

42:11.500 --> 42:13.500
Ahab has tried to save him.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.900
Harpoon Irish are heavy curses.

42:20.100 --> 42:24.200
Sorry! I did not know.

42:26.600 --> 42:28.500
Ahab has adopted me as his own.

42:29.200 --> 42:31.400
Since then he takes me along on every hunt.

42:33.000 --> 42:37.400
Ishmael, you hope that Ahab
you do not see ...

42:37.900 --> 42:41.400
you seduced his daughter.
- I'm sick of you!

42:41.600 --> 42:44.200
Oh fuck up!

42:51.500 --> 42:56.100
If you are not looking and your boyfriend
is not there ...

42:56.600 --> 42:59.500
I will cut ...
- Then I have something for you ...

43:00.300 --> 43:05.000
Ishmael quietly we sleep outside tonight.

43:11.400 --> 43:15.700
If you touch him I chop your head off.

43:25.900 --> 43:29.300
This is where we will find him.

43:29.900 --> 43:34.400
We will impale him and I will
his mask back stabbing.

43:35.800 --> 43:41.400
I will then the white dragon
his narrator are ...

43:42.200 --> 43:46.400
his teacher.
I put my head into that.

43:46.900 --> 43:49.300
And this is my friend the harpoon ...
I have the white dragon ...

43:54.300 --> 43:56.500
threw his skull.

43:57.700 --> 44:00.100
I have not slain this time
I will not fail.

44:04.700 --> 44:08.400
Captain? They are too many years ...

44:08.900 --> 44:12.100
too many years and when you only
but pursues ...

44:12.200 --> 44:14.800
The crew will come with me.
- They swear their souls away ...

44:15.000 --> 44:16.100
as dog food.

44:16.300 --> 44:20.800
Like you did, Mr.. Starbuck
just like you did.

44:25.400 --> 44:30.500
Well, you're with me or against me?

44:34.400 --> 44:37.000
You do not fear
for Mr. Starbuck.

44:40.900 --> 44:45.700
But Ahab ... you should watch out for Ahab.

44:46.800 --> 44:50.600
Rachel tell her that I
will give a new direction.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.700
And so we left <i>
The hunting grounds Grijse windy </ i></i>

45:30.300 --> 45:32.600
<i> the country and went into the Dragon-Slayers. </ i></i>

45:42.100 --> 45:43.300
We're being followed.

45:43.600 --> 45:47.000
I see him all day,
when I am posting at night.

45:51.200 --> 45:53.800
It will be an individual's
who hunt dragons.

45:53.900 --> 45:55.800
Have you already been in other countries?

45:55.900 --> 45:57.700
A couple of times with Ahab.

45:59.800 --> 46:01.800
You should be careful with Flask.

46:03.100 --> 46:04.800
Why?

46:06.000 --> 46:07.700
In the beginning, he
harpooner us ...

46:07.800 --> 46:10.100
but the animals could not face.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
He hit him when he
first had to throw ...

46:13.100 --> 46:15.500
Ahab wants him to forget it.

46:16.600 --> 46:20.500
Ahab hates cowards.
He can not tolerate their fear.

46:21.900 --> 46:25.000
He left Flask remain as abstractor.

46:25.600 --> 46:30.100
He wants this thankless job because
he is very close to Rachel.

46:30.500 --> 46:32.600
Now he wants a fight?
- No, he already has one.

46:38.000 --> 46:43.300
I'm going for a piece and you're with me.

46:53.400 --> 46:55.900
There are visible dragons.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.300
They hunt in the woods.

47:04.200 --> 47:06.500
Starbucks says they are teasing you.

47:07.600 --> 47:09.900
I'll be sleepwalking.

47:11.200 --> 47:13.900
Yes. - Will it go up to something?

47:14.300 --> 47:17.000
Well, we know each other yet
good enough. Not yet.

47:18.300 --> 47:21.100
Not yet? - What about you?

47:22.800 --> 47:26.200
I have no posse in my soul.
- Yes, you do.

47:27.600 --> 47:30.300
How long have you let us send by Ahab?

47:31.900 --> 47:34.700
If you have something different with women.

47:36.700 --> 47:40.300
You have to admit that you love
what to leave in the lurch.

47:40.900 --> 47:46.200
No, all I have to admit
is that you're really there for me.

47:46.600 --> 47:49.600
Is that why you my
wants to avenge father's death?

47:50.400 --> 47:53.500
My father that she always wisdom
and sadness do not go together.

47:54.400 --> 47:57.000
Sadness but also counts.

47:57.400 --> 48:02.200
Your father?
- Yes, he committed suicide ...

48:02.700 --> 48:04.300
when I was ten.

48:05.400 --> 48:08.300
My mother went though
they only could handle ...

48:09.100 --> 48:12.800
but there are lesions that
do not recover.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.100
And?

48:17.600 --> 48:21.700
I had to bury her
and m `s older brother took me to his house.

48:22.400 --> 48:25.300
But his wife do not like me.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.800
So I crept away with the mine caravan.

48:29.900 --> 48:32.300
And you filled your pockets with gold?

48:32.700 --> 48:35.600
I found only empty dreams.

48:38.000 --> 48:41.700
Until I met Queequeg,
He was the hunter of the caravan.

48:42.200 --> 48:45.100
Everyone kept alive by
his skill with his spear.

48:45.800 --> 48:47.600
He was my teacher.

48:49.800 --> 48:54.700
And friend.
- And shared your hunting area?

48:57.200 --> 48:57.900
Yes.

48:58.200 --> 49:01.900
Well poet, what can you tell me
on your travels?

49:08.500 --> 49:11.500
The presence of negotiations
drunks ...

49:11.600 --> 49:15.500
fraud, deceit, murder and kidnapping ...

49:16.200 --> 49:19.600
All that is behind the death.

49:20.200 --> 49:22.600
You realize that, for death.

49:22.800 --> 49:26.300
Love ... personal things
are the only ones worth something.

49:32.600 --> 49:38.300
It is nice to receive interest

49:39.500 --> 49:45.200
if you meet it.
You'll encounter all Rachel.

50:18.400 --> 50:22.100
Pure as snow, but I felt this thing.

50:23.400 --> 50:25.400
Be on your guard.
The mark of the beast.

50:31.600 --> 50:33.700
Ready Made before his crucifixion.

50:34.200 --> 50:38.900
I'm torn.
You can see it all.

50:39.600 --> 50:41.900
The Sacrifice ...
the shame ... the great white dragon.

50:47.400 --> 50:51.900
He just grabs and kills his own kind.

50:54.500 --> 50:57.700
But it's him or me.

51:00.700 --> 51:02.900
Starbuck see you now
as I showed you on the map.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.400
Let us go back.

51:18.400 --> 51:19.900
<i> There is an anger in some souls </ i></i>

51:19.900 --> 51:22.200
<i> that goes so deep into the darkest fields, </ i></i>

51:22.800 --> 51:24.900
<i> surrounded by death. </ i></i>

51:24.900 --> 51:28.200
They fly all over <i> elusive creatures. </ i></i>

51:29.400 --> 51:32.000
<i> Queequeg and I are trapped
In Ahab's vengeance. </ i></i>

52:01.300 --> 52:03.900
It feels like we are trapped.

52:09.100 --> 52:11.500
We would have to go away.

52:13.800 --> 52:15.000
For Rachel.

52:19.700 --> 52:23.400
Your two up, now.

52:28.900 --> 52:32.300
Mr. Starbuck and I will
our last trip plans ...

52:32.500 --> 52:34.700
through the mountain.

52:34.800 --> 52:37.400
You have until the morning, Rachel.

52:49.700 --> 52:52.600
How much?
- Enough to keep the richest ...

52:52.800 --> 52:54.300
husband.

52:59.000 --> 53:03.800
Females ...
It seems that at least thirty.

53:04.300 --> 53:05.700
Could be.

53:06.700 --> 53:09.600
We only have until the morning.
Then we should go.

53:10.400 --> 53:13.500
Why? This is what we came.

53:13.600 --> 53:16.600
We can fill our packing space
alone of this fold.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.800
Ahab has commissioned
kill them all.

56:53.300 --> 56:56.700
You have them all slain Rachel?

57:04.300 --> 57:06.900
Mr. Hurry. Flask!

57:13.400 --> 57:17.200
Starbuck!
I said stop, Mr. Flask.

57:17.500 --> 57:20.000
Captain we have the necessary oil-Fitri.

57:20.600 --> 57:22.400
Look!

57:29.400 --> 57:34.400
Hey ...
Did I not tell you.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.300
Did I not tell Mr. Starbuck?

57:37.700 --> 57:39.500
You did.

57:40.600 --> 57:43.200
Get on board. We must go.

57:43.800 --> 57:45.600
With all the oil-Fitri?

57:45.700 --> 57:47.700
Too late. We have to go right now.

57:48.600 --> 57:50.600
We must follow him to his nest.

57:56.400 --> 58:00.100
Queequeg? Queequeg?
- It's a sign.

58:01.300 --> 58:03.900
I will die in a short time.

58:07.400 --> 58:09.600
Has everyone gone mad?

58:10.200 --> 58:12.600
We have not slain.

58:15.400 --> 58:19.300
The white dragon has come
to tell me ...

58:25.900 --> 58:28.200
I'm a murderer ...

58:30.700 --> 58:33.500
and did nothing all slaughtered.

58:40.300 --> 58:42.800
I must die.

58:55.000 --> 58:59.000
We can not just go away.
- Of course we can.

59:00.600 --> 59:02.500
It's silly to go away.

59:03.300 --> 59:04.800
Captain may have
we think about it.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.900
You know what to do Mr. Starbuck.

59:07.100 --> 59:11.500
That's what we came and all
animals have been slaughtered.

59:12.000 --> 59:16.800
It was the oil-Fitri.
- Are you questioning my orders?

59:17.000 --> 59:19.600
So we have not slain?

59:20.400 --> 59:22.000
There is enough oil-Fitri by killing ...

59:22.400 --> 59:24.800
for the rest of your life rich.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.300
That is why we
that journey.

59:27.700 --> 59:31.200
You think I will survive year after year ...

59:31.800 --> 59:35.400
dragging and struggling, and yes slaughter ...

59:35.600 --> 59:39.300
for the money or admit
in negotiations?

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
Do you think I want?

59:45.100 --> 59:50.000
You think I wear body
knock on this barren land ...

59:50.500 --> 59:55.500
For more than you are alive ...
hollo me the attraction of death?

59:55.700 --> 59:57.700
After years I decided, despite
the humiliation ...

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:06.600
return to the marketplace ...

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:11.100
to stay alive for another year.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Before I got a chance so I
the white dragon can kill.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.400
I will not be stopped
my goal.

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:26.500
I will stop you.
How ... without your guard ...

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.700
Where did he go?

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.200
He's in a trance.

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:38.100
He will not save you.
I kind of already happened.

01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:41.100
They withdraw into themselves back ...

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:44.700
if they violated their ancient habits.

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:47.700
I will not tolerate mutiny.

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:51.200
Make his arms together
Mr. fixed. Starbuck ...

01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:56.000
and chain him to the back.

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:02.500
Mr. Flask, grab the chains.

01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:05.000
With pleasure.

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.900
Captain!
- Rachel, no!

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:15.700
Together we have come this far.

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:19.400
This is the beast that killed your father.

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:23.800
He teases us and challenge us.

01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:27.200
He knows we want to kill.

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:30.600
Now you bring the vehicle in motion.

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:47.500
Why? Why did you betray me?

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.400
I loved you like a son.

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.900
Beware of yourself old man!

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.900
There is only one God, and
a captain on this vehicle.

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.400
You had to warn me!

01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:28.100
But I forgive you Rachel.
Just as I am your father forgave.

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:35.300
I told you that I get.

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:41.200
Imprisoned, chained and
at the rear of the vehicle.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:44.900
By some twisted fate
a kind of retaliation.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.500
To let me lead to forgiveness?

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.700
I do not know.
But I know I hated Ahab.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.100
I hated that fucking old man.

01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:01.300
You take the second?
Look to the deck if we followed.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:07.400
Yes, I have already told people
seen going into a trance ...

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.600
just like this for days.

01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:14.700
Ichmail, should not have done.
He had to expect.

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:18.200
Like Starbuck, Ahab wanted stabbing down.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.700
Ahab will let him back inside.

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:29.500
The captain will let him back inside.

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:34.400
It's ...
It's just we do, Rachel.

01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:40.200
Do you understand that?
- Ishmael, our spear throwing.

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:42.700
Ahab needs him.

01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:59.700
Ishmael, you got to eat.

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:01.900
Ahab wants you all
not have out here.

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:05.000
I do not want you out here are.

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.600
Please talk with him once.

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.900
You can come along and inside
discuss with him.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.500
Rachel Starbuck he has slain.

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.800
Starbucks wanted to murder him.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Do not you understand?
- No, you do not understand.

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:27.600
This is Ahab's vehicle.
He responded in self-defense.

01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:32.300
Rachel, I care about you.

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:40.300
If that is true you to come inside,

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.800
and talk to the Captain.

01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:51.900
There is no talk
with someone who's crazy.

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:21.100
Ahab? - What's going on?
- They steal the oil-Fitri.

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:25.300
Rachel?

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Ishmael can come on board.

01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:54.600
He has earned for itself.

01:08:55.899 --> 01:08:58.200
Bring me my spear back.

01:08:59.399 --> 01:09:01.399
Yes, sir.

01:09:06.899 --> 01:09:11.000
Do you stay or leave us Queequeg?

01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:14.600
... It is time to decide.

01:09:14.899 --> 01:09:16.500
To decide what?

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:20.200
You follow?

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:24.899
An old man who damaged his
fears chasing.

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:27.800
Grab your share and leave.

01:09:27.899 --> 01:09:30.399
We stood in a field of carnage.

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:36.100
Why did you let them out?

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:41.000
You fucking psychopath. You've just
slain more than I will ever do.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.399
I am a killer, I kill only
what I needed.

01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:53.200
You know all too well.

01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:56.300
For I must now pay.
I have offended the gods.

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:03.200
Gods ... Gods.

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:11.100
Sun moves by itself?
Or is there anyone up there ...

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:14.200
some god?

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:17.100
Seems a star by itself ...

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:20.600
or he is guided by some
invisible power?

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:23.200
How can one little heart beat by itself?

01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:26.900
How brains can think for themselves?

01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:32.500
In all those years Queequeg
you that you have wondered.

01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:35.000
Like me.

01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:37.500
And who will want to try us.

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:41.400
Where do murderers go Queequeg?

01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:44.400
Where? Damn.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.300
You're driven, I am passionate ...

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:51.500
the fate of our own will.

01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:57.400
Therefore, we all suffer?

01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:30.400
Rachel?

01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:34.700
We must anchor here.

01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:48.900
Ishmael.
Queequeg.

01:11:57.900 --> 01:12:00.900
Why are we stopping?
- Furthermore, we can not.

01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:03.300
The rest we can walk.

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:07.400
You must lower the anchors
of the vehicle ... they are frozen.

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:15.900
There.

01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:34.300
I want you, I need you.

01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:52.800
You know. - I kill you!

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:56.800
Nobody can hear us.

01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:51.600
You have to come with me as
you give to Rachel.

01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:54.600
I know you do.

01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:57.900
He does not come along.

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:05.100
Yes I must do.

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:08.500
We must come face Tanis.

01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:13.000
You gotta help me this
dragon hunt in his nest.

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:16.300
I need you, Ishmael.

01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:18.800
Rachel needs you.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.100
We will never again get this chance.

01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:24.200
I've never been so close to ...

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:27.100
to meet our father.

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:40.800
You need me ... not protect Ishmael.

01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:43.800
I know.

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:50.100
But I want to do this.

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:53.500
For you.

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:40.900
<i> And so we followed Ahab. </ i></i>

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.800
<i> Climbing up to the dragon's nest. </ i></i>

01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:46.900
<i> to the caves of death. </ i></i>

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:51.900
<i> Fiquay, followed us even though he
he ran to meet his death. </ i></i>

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:55.000
<i> He was closer to something
which he had ever believed </ i></i>

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.200
<i> that he would not survive. </ i></i>

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.700
I know another entrance to the nest.

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:56.300
Okay.

01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:04.500
Ishmael I can not go with you.

01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:09.400
I see.
- I'll stay here.

01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:13.300
I pray for you.
- I'll be right back.

01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:35.100
Monitor the roof.

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:38.000
We need to lure him here.

01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:11.200
Rachel?

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.600
Rachel?

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:06.600
All those years you told me
the dragon that killed my father ...

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:08.800
while it was you!

01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:14.300
I thought he now
to dust was gone.

01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:20.000
Do not you dare lie to me
that's your harpoon in his back.

01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:23.300
He was a coward.

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:26.000
He deserved to die.

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:36.900
I would accept and not cowardice.
- So you killed him ...

01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:39.900
not surprising because he wanted to be like you?

01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:42.700
Where do murderers go Ahab?

01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:46.100
He ran, he would not himself
under the eyes.

01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:48.700
Fearfulness. Can you not understand that, Rachel?

01:24:57.300 --> 01:24:59.300
That is why I return.

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:04.900
I was ...

01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:11.500
I ran ...

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:23.200
<i> ICEM </ i></i>

01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:36.200
I ran away.

01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:44.500
She was still alive.

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:47.900
But I was afraid
and was a coward, ran away ...

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:06.500
I can not ... escape the screams.

01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:24.600
I ... I can not ...

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:27.000
like a coward.

01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:52.100
I ... will therefore always ...
marked by him.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.300
You must understand that my
have sacrificed life ...

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:02.000
to avenge myself.

01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:07.300
I am closer than ever before.

01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:12.400
Rachel
I almost had him stuck in a corner ...

01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:14.100
with your father.

01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:15.800
Go to hell.

01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:23.000
You just might kill you
of your guilt free.

01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:26.800
Let's go!

01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:42.600
You can not just leave.

01:27:42.700 --> 01:27:44.400
Ishmael!

01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:49.100
No, no! Queequeg.

01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:53.500
Queequeg no, no.

01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:08.800
I'll kill you old man!

01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:01.300
Rachel.

01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:34.700
<i> I saw before my eyes to how the Demon
joined by his gods. </ i></i>

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:36.700
<i> Rachel was again released from his captivity </ i></i>

01:29:37.100 --> 01:29:39.500
<i> from his retaliatory action. </ i></i>

01:29:40.300 --> 01:29:43.200
<i> All men were slain, as was said. </ i></i>

01:29:43.300 --> 01:29:44.900
<i> Only one man survived. </ i></i>
