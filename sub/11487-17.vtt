00:01.160 --> 00:03.879
So any thoughts on what
you'd like for dinner this weekend?

00:04.040 --> 00:07.077
You decide, honey.
l love everything you cook.

00:07.600 --> 00:09.033
All of a sudden l'm a woman. . .

00:09.200 --> 00:12.033
. . .because l cook and try to make
a nice home for you?

00:12.760 --> 00:14.398
Okay, l heard it too. Shut up.

00:15.120 --> 00:17.759
Ramming speed!

00:18.760 --> 00:20.512
-Jake.
-Leave him alone.

00:20.680 --> 00:24.434
With his grades, he might as well get
used to pushing shopping carts around.

00:25.120 --> 00:27.315
My son is gonna
end up working in a supermarket?

00:27.480 --> 00:29.948
No, l'm saying he's probably
gonna end up homeless.

00:31.400 --> 00:34.551
Well, as l live and breathe,
Charlie Harper.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.951
Oh, great. Archie.

00:39.440 --> 00:42.113
So how's the best jingle writer
in the business?

00:42.280 --> 00:44.316
Looks like he's put on a few pounds.

00:45.160 --> 00:46.309
This is my brother Alan.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.869
Alan, Archie Baldwin,
the king of the jingle writers.

00:49.040 --> 00:50.439
Well, l don't know about that.

00:50.600 --> 00:53.512
More like the ayatollah
of the jingle writers.

00:53.840 --> 00:55.876
The grand Pooh-Bah, if you will.

00:56.680 --> 00:58.398
Really?
What's that make you, Charlie?

00:58.560 --> 01:00.949
To be honest, a little nauseous.

01:01.120 --> 01:03.793
We should get together sometime.
Maybe collaborate.

01:03.960 --> 01:06.918
-l'd like that.
-Well, sure, there's no downside for you.

01:09.280 --> 01:11.794
What the hell, remind me about it
at the awards dinner.

01:11.960 --> 01:13.552
Oh, l'm not going to that.

01:13.720 --> 01:15.039
Why not? You're nominated.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.758
Wait, what are you nominated for?

01:16.920 --> 01:19.878
lt's a silly advertising award.
Doesn't mean anything.

01:20.040 --> 01:23.715
Yeah, he's right. lt's not about
the trophies, it's about the work.

01:23.880 --> 01:26.599
PS, my work has won seven trophies.

01:28.160 --> 01:30.628
Hey, one more, l'll have a menorah.

01:31.680 --> 01:34.114
Well, good luck, Archie.
But l think l'll pass.

01:34.280 --> 01:36.510
Oh, well, good for you.
Stay home and sulk.

01:36.920 --> 01:38.638
Nice meeting you.

01:38.800 --> 01:43.191
Okay, where do they keep
the extra-large condoms?

01:45.160 --> 01:46.957
Boy, he's a piece of work.

01:47.120 --> 01:49.190
He's a piece of something.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.749
How come you never
mentioned that whole award thing?

01:51.920 --> 01:53.592
l've been nominated plenty of times.

01:53.760 --> 01:56.513
-How many times have you won?
-What difference does it make?

01:56.680 --> 01:57.954
So never.

01:58.600 --> 01:59.874
Yes, Alan, never.

02:00.040 --> 02:02.759
But that guy Archie
has won like seven times.

02:02.920 --> 02:04.478
Yes, he has.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.471
That's gotta sting.

02:08.280 --> 02:11.750
Hey, Alan, you ever been beaten
to death with a can of corn?

02:13.000 --> 02:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:55.720 --> 02:57.756
Toe-Zene shouldn 't be used
by pregnant women...

02:57.920 --> 03:00.753
...people with heart conditions
or taking SSI inhibitors.

03:05.360 --> 03:08.238
l don't know. This could be my year.

03:09.280 --> 03:12.556
-l really think it's your best work.
-Thanks.

03:12.720 --> 03:15.234
l know l said the same thing
about Mr. Herpes Lip Balm.

03:15.520 --> 03:16.509
Yeah.

03:16.680 --> 03:19.035
Just Like a Woman Natural Douche.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.953
And that hemorrhoid cream.
What was it called?

03:23.200 --> 03:25.111
Fire in the Hole.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.392
Yeah, that was good.

03:28.560 --> 03:31.870
But Toe-Zene is the one
that's finally gonna bring home the gold.

03:32.040 --> 03:34.759
-Thanks for your support, Rose.
-You're welcome.

03:34.920 --> 03:37.070
Now, can you do something for me?

03:38.920 --> 03:39.909
No.

03:41.240 --> 03:42.719
Oh, come on, Charlie.

03:43.320 --> 03:45.834
l want you to talk to my boyfriend.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.230
Why would l wanna talk
to your boyfriend?

03:48.400 --> 03:50.152
Because he's smothering me.

03:50.320 --> 03:53.756
And not in the good ''can you move
your thigh off my face'' kind of way.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.514
l need my space, Charlie.

03:57.680 --> 04:00.319
l wake up in the morning
and there he is staring at me.

04:00.480 --> 04:03.438
l have a bowl of soup
and there he is blowing on it for me.

04:03.600 --> 04:04.715
Even when we have sex. . .

04:04.880 --> 04:08.031
. . .l can feel his eyes
burning a hole in the back of my head.

04:09.560 --> 04:12.154
Oh, that's gonna keep me up at night.

04:12.960 --> 04:18.512
You need to explain to him that if you
love someone, you have to let them go.

04:18.680 --> 04:20.398
lf they come back, they're yours.

04:20.560 --> 04:23.313
lf they don't, then you stalk them.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.149
l really don't wanna get involved
in your love life.

04:26.320 --> 04:29.949
Well, if someone doesn't talk to him,
we're gonna have to break up.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.556
Do what you have to do.

04:32.720 --> 04:34.597
Oh, l get it.

04:34.760 --> 04:36.512
You want me to be single again.

04:39.400 --> 04:40.879
Get him over here.

04:41.440 --> 04:43.192
Thank you.

04:43.360 --> 04:45.191
Was that so hard?

04:58.240 --> 05:00.800
l had no idea these awards
were so prestigious.

05:01.320 --> 05:03.709
They're meaningless crap.

05:04.040 --> 05:07.271
Come on. Look at this list
of past winners for best jingle.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.954
Barry Manilow, Randy Newman,
Kenny Loggins. . .

05:10.120 --> 05:14.398
. . .Archie Baldwin, Archie Baldwin
Archie Baldwin, Archie--

05:14.560 --> 05:15.754
What's your point?

05:15.920 --> 05:18.275
My point is
it's an honor just to be nominated.

05:18.440 --> 05:20.590
No, no, it's an honor to win.

05:20.760 --> 05:24.719
Being nominated
is just a soul-sucking waste of time.

05:25.080 --> 05:26.798
Why are you so sure
you're gonna lose?

05:26.960 --> 05:29.030
lt doesn't matter
who wrote the best jingle. . .

05:29.200 --> 05:31.395
. . .it's about
who has the sexiest product.

05:31.560 --> 05:34.154
That's why the awards
always go to car and beer ads.

05:34.320 --> 05:36.834
Over-the-counter medications
just aren't hip enough.

05:38.520 --> 05:40.875
-That hardly seems fair.
-Tell me about it.

05:41.040 --> 05:44.749
Encourage people to get drunk
and drive fast, great, here's an award.

05:44.920 --> 05:48.117
Relieve the heartbreak
of vaginal itching?

05:49.760 --> 05:51.876
They don't even wanna
shake your hand.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.880
Well, win or lose,
you should still go to the ceremony.

05:56.040 --> 05:58.793
No, no, no. No. An awards
ceremony is like a Thai massage.

05:58.960 --> 06:02.635
lf you don't know that there's gonna be
a happy ending, no point in lying down.

06:02.800 --> 06:05.633
You have a family who's proud
of your accomplishments. . .

06:05.800 --> 06:07.756
. . .and might like the chance
to share them.

06:07.920 --> 06:09.399
What family is that?

06:09.560 --> 06:11.869
Your family: Me, Jake, Mom.

06:12.040 --> 06:14.634
Whoa, do not tell Mom
about this nomination.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.552
-lt's a good thing.
-lt doesn't matter.

06:16.720 --> 06:19.234
lf it's a good thing
she'll find a way to make it bad.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.789
-Okay, now you're just being ridiculous.
-Oh, really?

06:21.960 --> 06:23.359
Let's try a little experiment.

06:23.520 --> 06:25.750
l'll pretend l'm Mom,
you tell me something good.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.873
All right.

06:28.040 --> 06:30.395
Hey, Mom,
l have discovered a cure for cancer.

06:31.040 --> 06:32.314
Very nice.

06:32.480 --> 06:36.109
Shame you couldn't do it in time
to save Uncle Walter's left testicle.

06:38.120 --> 06:39.519
Come on, give me another one.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.468
-No, l get the idea.
-No, no. no. Hit me.

06:42.640 --> 06:44.437
Okay.

06:44.840 --> 06:47.593
Gee, Mom,
it really is a beautiful day, huh?

06:47.760 --> 06:51.070
Try telling that
to Uncle Walter's one good nut.

06:53.160 --> 06:54.673
Okay.

06:54.840 --> 06:56.159
l adore my son.

06:56.320 --> 06:57.958
Somebody has to.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.750
-How about friendship?
-How about Judas?

07:03.920 --> 07:04.989
-Family.
-Manson.

07:05.160 --> 07:06.149
-Puppies.
-Rabies.

07:06.320 --> 07:07.639
-Love.
-Communicable disease.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.756
-You win.
-Quitter.

07:09.920 --> 07:11.672
-Leave me alone.
-You're already alone.

07:11.840 --> 07:14.149
Your wife threw you out, remember?

07:17.680 --> 07:20.353
Damn it, Gordon, get up there
and talk to Charlie.

07:20.520 --> 07:22.476
But l don't wanna talk to Charlie.

07:22.640 --> 07:24.551
Do you like having sex with me,
Gordon?

07:25.120 --> 07:26.439
Hey, Charlie.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.158
Hey, Gordon.

07:28.320 --> 07:30.151
-What's going on?
-Oh, not much.

07:30.320 --> 07:34.632
l was just passing by,
thought l'd see how you were doing.

07:35.440 --> 07:36.714
l'm doing fine.

07:36.880 --> 07:38.359
Good.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.598
Good.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.189
Nice shirt.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.354
Right back at you.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.678
So. . .

07:50.840 --> 07:54.389
. . .Rose says l have to talk to you
or l can't have sex with her anymore.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.239
l see. You sure you're making
the right choice?

07:57.720 --> 07:59.233
Call me crazy.

07:59.440 --> 08:02.591
Well, crazy's the price of admission
for that ride.

08:03.200 --> 08:05.031
Okay, come here, sit down.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.150
-You want a beer?
-Oh, no, thank you.

08:08.360 --> 08:10.157
l'm a really mean drunk.

08:11.160 --> 08:12.957
l sensed that.

08:13.800 --> 08:16.598
Anyway, the thing you need
to understand about Rose. . .

08:16.760 --> 08:19.957
. . .about any woman really, is
that they want what they can't have.

08:20.120 --> 08:21.519
But Rose can have me.

08:21.680 --> 08:22.829
Trust me on this, Gordon.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.230
You play it cool, keep your distance,
be aloof. . .

08:25.400 --> 08:27.675
. . .you'll have to call the cops
to get rid of her.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.070
-You really think so?
-No, l know so.

08:30.720 --> 08:33.154
But they won't come right away.

08:33.679 --> 08:37.070
She'll still have time to hot-glue
her high school graduation picture. . .

08:37.240 --> 08:39.595
. . .to your freshly shaved ass.

08:47.880 --> 08:50.269
Hey, Mom, here's some good news.

08:50.440 --> 08:52.192
lt seems with medical breakthroughs. . .

08:52.360 --> 08:55.432
. . .the average life span
will soon be 1 00 years.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.353
Wonderful. More time to be ignored
by your children.

09:01.360 --> 09:02.873
Amazing.

09:04.120 --> 09:06.350
Morning, Mom.
You're looking very pretty today.

09:06.520 --> 09:09.318
That's nice, because inside l'm dead.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.359
When you're right, you're right.

09:14.520 --> 09:16.112
Charlie, l need a favor.

09:16.280 --> 09:20.239
Yeah, well, l need a healthy liver,
and there's a long waiting list for both.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.990
l've got a client coming into town
next Saturday.

09:23.160 --> 09:26.789
-And he's bringing his lovely daughter.
-And by lovely she means dog-like.

09:28.120 --> 09:31.795
All right, she may not be a beauty queen,
but she does have a terrific figure.

09:31.960 --> 09:34.030
l'm guessing six nipples.

09:37.920 --> 09:41.071
Anyhow, l was hoping you could show
her a good time. No big deal.

09:41.240 --> 09:42.958
You don't have to take her to dinner.

09:43.120 --> 09:45.998
Go to the beach and throw a stick
till she gets tired.

09:47.440 --> 09:51.672
Gee, Mom, as much as l'd love to
service the unfortunate little schnauzer. . .

09:51.840 --> 09:54.035
-. . .l'm busy next Saturday.
-What are you doing?

09:54.800 --> 09:57.473
l-- l've-- l've got a-- l've got a thing.

09:57.640 --> 10:00.518
Don't lie. You've got nothing,
you just don't want to help me.

10:00.680 --> 10:03.069
No, no, no. No, l swear, l have plans.

10:03.240 --> 10:06.915
l'm going to this awards ceremony.

10:07.080 --> 10:08.559
You never go to these things.

10:08.720 --> 10:10.392
Yeah, well, this year's different.

10:10.560 --> 10:14.155
Your client's daughter will just have
to hump somebody else's leg.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.995
l told you l could get him to go.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.239
This is really boring.

10:31.720 --> 10:33.551
Just keep it to yourself, Jake.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.790
l just don't understand
why l had to come.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.311
You're here to support
your Uncle Charlie.

10:38.480 --> 10:41.199
The same way he supported you
at your Christmas pageant.

10:41.360 --> 10:44.318
The one where you stood
in back picking lint off your antlers. . .

10:44.480 --> 10:47.517
. . .while the rest of the class recited
''The Night Before Kwanzaa. ''

10:48.520 --> 10:50.192
Oh, yeah.

10:50.760 --> 10:52.557
-Uncle Charlie?
-What?

10:52.720 --> 10:55.188
Now you have to come
to my Easter pageant.

10:57.160 --> 11:00.232
-This event isn't televised, is it?
-No.

11:00.720 --> 11:03.154
Well, l guess they only show
the important awards.

11:06.520 --> 11:10.115
Congratulations, you've just been elected
tonight's designated driver.

11:13.280 --> 11:14.713
Come on, just ignore her.

11:15.240 --> 11:19.472
lgnore her? lt'd be easier to ignore
blood in my urine.

11:19.680 --> 11:23.355
Well, well, well,
look who decided to be a good sport.

11:23.520 --> 11:25.033
Speaking of blood in my urine.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.758
Hey, Archie.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.558
Hey, l wanna tell you people. . .

11:28.720 --> 11:30.790
. . .this man has been a real inspiration
to me.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.598
-Oh, come on.
-No, no, l mean it.

11:32.760 --> 11:36.309
When l'm struggling to write a jingle
and l feel like l'm not measuring up. . .

11:36.480 --> 11:39.836
. . .l ask myself,
''How would Charlie Harper write this?''

11:40.000 --> 11:43.515
And the answer always makes me feel
better about my own work.

11:45.040 --> 11:47.873
Charlie, aren't you going
to introduce me?

11:48.320 --> 11:50.231
Mom, Archie. Archie, Mom.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.152
You're Charlie's mother?

11:52.320 --> 11:55.517
Oh, a teenage pregnancy, no doubt.

11:57.520 --> 11:59.351
How brave of you to keep him.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.553
Well, aren't you adorable.

12:03.320 --> 12:06.392
Mom. Archie is nominated
in the same category as Charlie.

12:06.560 --> 12:10.075
Oh, well, l'll be rooting for you,
Archie.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.594
-Okay, then, thanks for stopping by.
-Good luck.

12:14.760 --> 12:16.876
-You deserve it this year.
-Thanks.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.917
l mean, how many times
can they snub you?

12:19.480 --> 12:22.153
-l don't really keep track.
-Seven.

12:23.880 --> 12:26.633
Seven years in a row.

12:26.840 --> 12:27.829
lf you say so.

12:28.520 --> 12:30.590
Hey, stick around after the ceremony.

12:30.760 --> 12:32.512
lf l win, l'll let you hold my trophy.

12:35.040 --> 12:38.077
Not to mention the little statue
they give me.

12:42.760 --> 12:44.910
lsn't the little statue the trophy?

12:45.560 --> 12:47.391
Just eat your chicken.

12:48.520 --> 12:50.750
Before we present
the Jingle of the Year Award. . .

12:50.920 --> 12:52.672
. . .we have a special treat.

12:52.840 --> 12:55.638
Please tell me
they're gonna pass out guns.

12:55.800 --> 12:58.633
Our very own seven-time
award winner. . .

12:58.800 --> 13:01.189
. . .here to perform
his own nominated tune. . .

13:01.360 --> 13:04.875
. . .composed especially for the United
Nations Save-an-Orphan program--

13:05.040 --> 13:07.793
Oh, God, not orphans.

13:07.960 --> 13:09.439
Archie Baldwin.

13:09.960 --> 13:12.076
Oh, goodie.

13:14.840 --> 13:17.638
This is for all the orphans out there.

13:22.120 --> 13:26.318
There's no tree at Christmastime

13:26.480 --> 13:29.950
No pumpkin Hallow's Eve

13:30.560 --> 13:34.838
No candles on the birthday cake

13:35.000 --> 13:39.835
No reason to believe

13:40.000 --> 13:45.154
He works all day in a cold, dark mine

13:45.320 --> 13:48.756
His little lungs filled with soot

13:50.000 --> 13:53.310
Her mommy's Kim Jong's concubine

13:53.480 --> 13:57.712
Her dad was killed
By the Tonton Macoutes

13:57.880 --> 14:00.235
Save the orphans

14:02.640 --> 14:05.677
Save the orphans

14:09.080 --> 14:10.832
Don 't do it for me

14:11.000 --> 14:12.956
Don 't do it for you

14:13.520 --> 14:16.114
Do it for little Kim Sung

14:16.280 --> 14:17.599
And Abu

14:18.240 --> 14:21.277
Yeah, save the orphans

14:21.800 --> 14:23.518
Come on, everybody.

14:23.680 --> 14:26.638
Save the orphans

14:26.800 --> 14:28.711
They're tax-deductible.

14:28.880 --> 14:31.189
Save the orphans

14:31.360 --> 14:33.396
Get them while they're still cute.

14:33.560 --> 14:35.278
Save the orphans

14:35.440 --> 14:37.749
Get them young,
teach them your tongue.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.911
Save the orphans

14:40.080 --> 14:42.355
Woody Allen can't marry them all.

14:42.520 --> 14:44.476
Save the orphans

14:44.640 --> 14:46.870
Some of them
don't even have parents.

14:47.280 --> 14:49.191
Save the orphans

14:49.360 --> 14:51.954
Get two, get one free.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.675
Save the orphans

14:54.840 --> 14:56.751
Use them as bait for scholarships.

14:56.920 --> 14:58.956
Save the orphans

14:59.120 --> 15:01.509
Save the orphans

15:03.800 --> 15:06.678
Save the orphans

15:06.840 --> 15:08.558
Enough.

15:09.400 --> 15:10.913
Come on. lt's catchy.

15:11.080 --> 15:13.355
So is diphtheria.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.310
How come you don't get
a runner-up trophy?

15:16.480 --> 15:17.595
Because l don't.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.554
At school everybody gets a trophy
just for participating.

15:21.320 --> 15:24.869
Well, Jake, that's the difference
between school and life.

15:25.040 --> 15:29.909
ln life all you get for participating is pain,
loneliness and death.

15:31.560 --> 15:33.790
Better luck next year, Charlie.

15:33.960 --> 15:36.235
Good night, boys.

15:41.720 --> 15:43.790
Oh, yeah, l forgot.

15:43.960 --> 15:47.032
There's also crushing humiliation.

15:48.960 --> 15:51.918
Well, in sixth grade, you get a trophy.

15:58.840 --> 16:01.400
Hey, can l get you anything?

16:02.640 --> 16:05.757
A length of rope and a rickety stool?

16:06.840 --> 16:10.594
Charlie, it's understandable that you
might be a little blue right now. . .

16:10.760 --> 16:12.557
. . .but that will pass.

16:13.320 --> 16:15.390
Get out of here, Alan.

16:15.560 --> 16:20.395
You know, l often find that
when things look darkest. . .

16:20.960 --> 16:22.632
. . .it really helps to share your--

16:22.800 --> 16:25.553
l swear, l will drop-kick you
over that railing.

16:26.840 --> 16:28.239
Alrighty.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.552
Pleasant dreams.

16:31.560 --> 16:34.358
You don't dream in a blackout,
you moron.

16:35.880 --> 16:38.952
-Hey, Charlie.
-Oh, God.

16:39.120 --> 16:42.715
-How did it go tonight?
-Let me put it this way:

16:42.880 --> 16:45.838
What the advertising community
did to me earlier this evening. . .

16:46.000 --> 16:48.434
. . .Archie Baldwin is now doing
to my mother.

16:49.320 --> 16:51.709
He's not acknowledging
her wonderful talent?

16:52.400 --> 16:55.358
-Just leave it alone, Rose.
-Sorry.

16:56.320 --> 16:57.878
Have you seen Gordon?

16:58.040 --> 16:59.758
Not since l talked to him.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.956
And by the way,
thanks for that opportunity.

17:02.400 --> 17:06.029
l've always wanted to bond
with a pasty kid who dresses like me.

17:06.480 --> 17:10.678
Well, l don't know what you said to him,
but he's been acting very strange lately.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.112
Lately?

17:13.280 --> 17:15.510
l keep calling,
but he doesn't pick up the phone.

17:15.680 --> 17:18.194
And when l leave a message,
he doesn't call back.

17:18.839 --> 17:21.069
l thought you wanted him to stop
being so clingy.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.958
l thought l did too.

17:23.119 --> 17:25.315
Now l miss his cute little face
peeking at me. . .

17:25.480 --> 17:29.314
. . .while l'm washing my hair, shaving my
legs, soaping up my breasts. . .

17:29.480 --> 17:33.439
. . .which you no doubt remember
are extremely firm and perky.

17:34.080 --> 17:36.435
So he spies on you in the shower?

17:37.080 --> 17:39.116
No, that would be weird.

17:41.920 --> 17:43.797
Why is love so complicated?

17:44.320 --> 17:45.833
l don't know, Rose.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.718
Stuff happens.

17:48.240 --> 17:52.438
Oh, Charlie, you always know
the right thing to say.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.392
This is a fine kettle of fish.

17:57.200 --> 18:00.317
Oh, why can't l just black out
in peace?

18:00.480 --> 18:02.948
''Be aloof,'' you said,
''play hard to get. ''

18:03.120 --> 18:05.998
You just wanted me out of your way
so you could make your move.

18:06.160 --> 18:07.149
You caught me, Gordon.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.390
Now, do the right thing and kill me.

18:11.480 --> 18:13.710
Oh, Charlie, is this true?

18:13.880 --> 18:16.872
ls this part of some devious plan
to win me back?

18:17.480 --> 18:20.278
You heard her, Gordon. Kill me.

18:20.440 --> 18:23.910
Rose, you wanted him out of your hair.
l got him out of your hair.

18:24.480 --> 18:28.109
-You wanted to get rid of me?
-No, l just need some space.

18:28.320 --> 18:30.709
You want space?
l'll give you all the space you want.

18:30.880 --> 18:32.916
-Fine.
-ln fact, l'll leave right now.

18:33.080 --> 18:35.594
Well, great.
l'll just stay here with Charlie.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.233
Nobody leaves.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.356
Nobody stays.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.309
Rose, get off me.

18:45.400 --> 18:47.868
Okay, now, everybody
listen carefully. . .

18:48.040 --> 18:51.715
. . .because l'm pretty sure
l'm only gonna be able to say this once.

18:52.160 --> 18:53.673
Rose, think about it.

18:53.840 --> 18:56.718
Where are you gonna find a guy
who loves you as much as Gordon?

18:57.320 --> 19:02.110
And, Gordon, where are you gonna find
a girl, period.

19:03.680 --> 19:04.874
The man makes sense, Rose.

19:05.800 --> 19:07.392
You're damn right l make sense.

19:07.560 --> 19:10.711
lf you kids don't patch things up,
you know what's gonna happen?

19:10.880 --> 19:14.077
You're gonna wind up old,
miserable and alone.

19:14.880 --> 19:16.199
He's right, Gordon.

19:16.360 --> 19:18.635
Look what happened to him.

19:19.400 --> 19:20.435
l love you, Rose.

19:21.080 --> 19:22.274
l love you too.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.675
Oh, good, a happy ending.

19:26.840 --> 19:28.273
Now, get the hell off my deck.

19:29.360 --> 19:31.510
-Come on, Lambchop, let's go home.
-Hold on.

19:32.160 --> 19:34.799
Climbing over the rail
is ridiculous and juvenile.

19:34.960 --> 19:37.838
From now on, l wanna take the stairs.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.472
Do you like having sex with me,
Gordon?

19:41.080 --> 19:42.832
Call me crazy.

19:48.720 --> 19:50.915
And the real winner tonight. . .

19:51.080 --> 19:52.752
. . .is Charlie Harper.

19:52.920 --> 19:54.319
A man with a heart so big. . .

19:54.480 --> 19:58.359
. . .that he'd step outside of his own
misery to help two people in need.

19:58.520 --> 19:59.669
Alan, l'm warning you.

19:59.840 --> 20:02.115
l know you don't wanna hear this.
Let me tell you.

20:02.280 --> 20:05.716
The Archie Baldwins of this world
are soon forgotten.

20:05.880 --> 20:08.952
lt's people like you, people
who are selfless and generous. . .

20:09.120 --> 20:10.394
. . .who will live on forever.

20:11.080 --> 20:12.638
Last chance.

20:13.440 --> 20:17.638
Oh, please, that grumpy-gus routine
does not-- Good night.
