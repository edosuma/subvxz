04:56.955 --> 04:58.991
Freddy, go and find a cab.

04:59.555 --> 05:01.671
Do you want me to catch pneumonia?

05:12.715 --> 05:15.513
Don't just stand there, Freddy.
Go and find a cab.

05:15.795 --> 05:18.070
All right, I'll get one.

05:33.155 --> 05:36.192
Look where you're goin', dear.
Look where you're goin'!

05:36.315 --> 05:37.509
I'm so sorry.

05:37.875 --> 05:41.390
Two bunches o' violets trod in the mud.
A full day's wages.

05:43.035 --> 05:45.754
-Freddy, go and find a cab.
-Yes, Mother.

05:48.675 --> 05:50.472
He's your son, is he?

05:50.555 --> 05:52.750
If you'd done your duty
as a mother should...

05:52.835 --> 05:56.623
...you wouldn't let 'im spoil a poor girl's
flow'rs and run away without payin'.

05:56.715 --> 05:58.546
Go about your business, my girl.

05:58.635 --> 06:01.308
And you wouldn't go off
without payin', either.

06:01.675 --> 06:04.348
Two bunches o' violets trod in the mud.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.828
Sir, is there any sign of it stopping?

06:09.915 --> 06:12.304
I'm afraid not. It's worse than before.

06:12.555 --> 06:14.671
If it's worse, it's a sign it's nearly over.

06:14.755 --> 06:17.428
Cheer up, Capt'n,
buy a flow'r off a poor girl.

06:17.515 --> 06:18.868
I'm sorry, I haven't any change.

06:18.955 --> 06:21.469
I can change 'alf a crown.
Take this for tuppence.

06:21.555 --> 06:23.944
I told you, I'm awfully sorry.
Wait a minute.

06:24.035 --> 06:27.107
Oh, yes. Here's three ha' pence,
if that's any use to you.

06:27.195 --> 06:28.514
Thank you, sir.

06:36.075 --> 06:38.384
You be careful.
Better give 'im a flower for it.

06:38.475 --> 06:40.352
There's a bloke here behind that pillar...

06:40.435 --> 06:43.154
...takin' down every blessed word
you're sayin'.

06:46.515 --> 06:49.075
I ain't done nothin' wrong
by speakin' to the gentleman.

06:49.155 --> 06:51.794
I've a right to sell flow'rs
if I keep off the curb.

06:51.875 --> 06:53.945
I'm a respectable girl, so help me.

06:54.115 --> 06:57.471
I never spoke to him except to ask him
to buy a flow'r off me.

06:57.555 --> 06:59.989
-What's the bloomin' noise?
-A tec's takin' her down.

07:00.075 --> 07:01.827
I'm makin' an honest livin'.

07:01.915 --> 07:03.826
Who's doing all that shouting?

07:05.595 --> 07:08.393
Sir, don't let 'im charge me.
You dunno what it means to me.

07:08.475 --> 07:11.353
They'll take away me character
and drive me on the streets...

07:11.435 --> 07:13.027
...for speakin' to gentlemen.

07:13.115 --> 07:16.824
There, there. Who's hurting you,
you silly girl? What'd you take me for?

07:16.915 --> 07:18.667
On my Bible oath, I never spoke a word.

07:18.755 --> 07:20.586
Shut up! Do I look like a policeman?

07:20.675 --> 07:23.872
Why'd ya take down me words?
'Ow do I know you took me down right?

07:23.955 --> 07:26.344
You just show me
what you wrote ab'ut me.

07:33.835 --> 07:35.951
That ain't proper writin'. I can't read it.

07:36.035 --> 07:36.945
I can.

07:37.035 --> 07:40.914
"I say, Capt'n,
now buy a flow'r off a poor girl."

07:44.075 --> 07:46.464
Oh, it's cause I called him "Capt'n."

07:47.035 --> 07:51.108
I meant no 'arm. Sir, don't let him lay
a charge against me for a word like that.

07:51.195 --> 07:54.471
I'll make no charge.
Really, sir, if you are a detective...

07:54.555 --> 07:57.547
...you needn't protect me
against molestation from young women...

07:57.635 --> 07:58.511
...until I ask you.

07:58.595 --> 08:00.870
Anyone could tell the girl meant no harm.

08:00.955 --> 08:03.913
He ain't no tec. He's a gentleman.
Look at his boots.

08:03.995 --> 08:05.906
How are all your people down at Selsey?

08:05.995 --> 08:08.384
Who told you my people
come from Selsey?

08:08.475 --> 08:09.954
Never mind, they do.

08:10.555 --> 08:14.309
How do you come to be up so far east?
You were born in Lisson Grove.

08:15.235 --> 08:18.466
What 'arm is there
in my leavin' Lisson Grove?

08:18.595 --> 08:21.667
It weren't fit for pigs to live.
I had to pay four and six a week.

08:21.755 --> 08:23.427
Live where you like but stop that noise!

08:23.515 --> 08:26.905
Come, come, he can't touch you.
You've a right to live where you please.

08:26.995 --> 08:28.792
I'm a good girl, I am.

08:29.315 --> 08:31.624
-Where do I come from?
-Hawkestone.

08:31.755 --> 08:34.349
Who said I didn't?
Blimey, you know everything, you do.

08:34.434 --> 08:37.472
You, sir, do you think
you could find me a taxi?

08:37.755 --> 08:39.552
Madam, it's stopped raining.

08:39.635 --> 08:42.024
You can get a motorbus to Hampton Court.

08:42.635 --> 08:43.784
Isn't that where you live?

08:43.875 --> 08:45.513
What impertinence!

08:45.955 --> 08:49.345
Tell 'im where he comes from,
if you wanta go fortune-telling.

08:51.395 --> 08:54.068
Cheltenham, Harrow...

08:55.155 --> 08:56.952
...Cambridge and...

08:58.915 --> 08:59.950
...lndia?

09:00.035 --> 09:01.184
Quite right.

09:01.515 --> 09:03.745
He ain't a tec, he's a bloomin' busybody.

09:03.835 --> 09:06.554
Do you do this sort of thing
for a living at a music hall?

09:06.635 --> 09:08.671
I have thought of it.
Perhaps I will one day.

09:08.755 --> 09:11.952
He's no gentleman, he ain't,
to interfere with a poor girl!

09:12.035 --> 09:13.673
How do you do it, may I ask?

09:13.755 --> 09:18.431
Simple phonetics. The science of speech.
That's my profession. Also my hobby.

09:18.875 --> 09:21.833
Anyone can spot an Irishman
or a Yorkshireman by his brogue...

09:21.915 --> 09:23.951
...but I can place a man within six miles.

09:24.035 --> 09:27.744
I can place 'im within two miles in London.
Sometimes within two streets.

09:27.835 --> 09:30.508
Ought to be ashamed of 'imself,
unmanly coward.

09:30.595 --> 09:32.392
-Is there a living in that?
-Oh, yes.

09:32.475 --> 09:35.672
Let him mind his own business
and leave a poor girl alone.

09:36.155 --> 09:38.623
Cease this detestable
boohooing instantly...

09:38.715 --> 09:41.468
...or else seek the shelter
of some other place of worship!

09:42.235 --> 09:44.988
I have a right to be here if I like,
same as you!

09:45.275 --> 09:47.914
A woman who utters such disgusting,
depressing noises...

09:47.995 --> 09:50.429
...has no right to be anywhere,
no right to live.

09:50.515 --> 09:52.233
Remember, you're a human with a soul...

09:52.315 --> 09:54.875
...and the divine gift of articulate speech.

09:55.035 --> 09:57.913
Your native language is the language
of Shakespeare and...

09:57.995 --> 10:01.988
...Milton and the Bible. Don't sit there
crooning like a bilious pigeon.

10:04.275 --> 10:06.550
"Look at her, a prisoner of the gutters

10:07.355 --> 10:09.630
"Condemned by every syllable she utters

10:10.635 --> 10:13.103
"By right she should be taken out and hung

10:13.675 --> 10:16.553
"For the cold-blooded murder
of the English tongue"

10:18.675 --> 10:20.313
Heavens, what a sound!

10:20.395 --> 10:22.545
"This is what the British population

10:22.995 --> 10:25.304
"Calls an elementary education"

10:25.755 --> 10:28.269
Come, sir, I think you've picked
a poor example.

10:28.355 --> 10:29.583
Did I?

10:30.195 --> 10:33.744
"Hear them down in Soho Square
Dropping H's everywhere

"It's 'aoow' and 'garn'

"Not her wretched clothes and dirty face

11:08.075 --> 11:11.226
"Why can't the English
teach their children how to speak?

11:11.515 --> 11:14.712
"This verbal class distinction
by now should be antique

"If you spoke as she does, sir,

11:18.635 --> 11:21.024
"Why, you might be selling flowers, too"

with her curbstone English...

...that'll keep her in the gutter
till the end of her days?

12:40.755 --> 12:44.714
In six months I could pass her off
as a duchess at an Embassy Ball.

12:44.875 --> 12:47.753
I could get her a job as a lady's maid
or a shop assistant...

12:47.835 --> 12:49.587
...which requires better English.

12:49.675 --> 12:51.347

12:51.675 --> 12:53.905
Yes, you squashed cabbage leaf!

Anything's possible.
I, myself, am a student of Indian dialects.

13:11.275 --> 13:15.109
Are you? Do you know Colonel Pickering,
the author of Spoken Sanskrit?

13:16.035 --> 13:18.230
I am Colonel Pickering. Who are you?

I'm Henry Higgins,
author of Higgins' Universal Alphabet.

-At the Carleton.

No, you're not.
You're staying at 27 A Wimpole Street.

13:33.995 --> 13:36.668
You come with me.
We'll have a little jaw over supper.

13:36.755 --> 13:38.666

13:59.675 --> 14:01.791
-How many are there actually?
-How many what?

14:01.875 --> 14:02.830
Indian dialects?

14:02.915 --> 14:07.067
No fewer than 147 distinct languages
are recorded as vernacular in India.

14:16.035 --> 14:20.108
Shouldn't we stand up, gentlemen?
We've got a bloomin' heiress in our midst.

18:20.795 --> 18:25.266
"Wouldn't it be loverly?"

19:06.115 --> 19:09.790
Come on, Alfie, let's go 'ome now.
This place is givin' me the willies.

19:09.875 --> 19:11.991
Home? What do you want to go 'ome for?

19:12.075 --> 19:15.431
It's nearly 5:00.
My daughter Eliza'll be along soon.

19:15.675 --> 19:18.712
She ought to be good for 'alf a crown
for a father that loves 'er.

19:18.795 --> 19:21.514
That's a laugh.
You ain't been near 'er for months.

19:21.595 --> 19:25.224
What's that got to do with it?
What's 'alf a crown after all I've give 'er?

19:25.315 --> 19:27.271
When did you ever give 'er anythin'?

19:27.355 --> 19:29.425
Anythin'? I give 'er everythin'.

19:29.515 --> 19:33.144
I give 'er the greatest gift
any human being can give to another:

19:33.235 --> 19:34.190
Life!

19:34.595 --> 19:38.793
I introduced 'er to this here planet, I did,
with all its wonders and marvels.

19:38.955 --> 19:41.389
The sun that shines, the moon that glows.

19:41.595 --> 19:44.348
Hyde Park to walk through
on a fine spring night.

19:44.715 --> 19:48.867
The 'ole ruddy city o' London to roam
around in sellin' 'er bloomin' flow'rs.

19:49.075 --> 19:50.508
I give 'er all that.

19:51.275 --> 19:54.028
Then I disappears and leaves 'er
on 'er own to enjoy it.

19:54.115 --> 19:56.310
If that ain't worth 'alf a crown
now and again...

19:56.395 --> 19:58.465
...l'll take my belt off and give 'er what for.

19:58.555 --> 20:01.627
You got a good 'eart.
But you want a 'alf a crown out o' Eliza...

20:01.715 --> 20:03.353
...you better have a good story.

20:03.435 --> 20:05.107
Leave that to me, my boy.

20:05.835 --> 20:08.713
-Good mornin', George.
-Not a brass farthin'.

20:15.595 --> 20:17.347
Not a brass farthin'.

21:35.275 --> 21:36.424
There she is.

21:44.595 --> 21:46.790
Why, Liza, what a surprise.

21:47.715 --> 21:50.548
Hop along, Charlie, you're too old for me.

21:50.955 --> 21:53.753
-Don't you know your daughter?
-You don't know what she looks like.

21:53.835 --> 21:56.554
I know 'er, I know 'er.
Come on, I'll find 'er.

22:24.755 --> 22:26.234
Eliza, what a surprise.

22:26.315 --> 22:27.828
Not a brass farthin'.

22:27.995 --> 22:30.111
Hey, you come 'ere, Eliza.

22:30.315 --> 22:32.465
I ain't gonna take me 'ard-earned wages...

22:32.555 --> 22:35.308
...and let you pass 'em on
to a bloody pubkeeper.

22:42.315 --> 22:45.227
You wouldn't send me 'ome
to your stepmother...

22:45.315 --> 22:48.193
...without a drop o' liquid protection,
would ya?

22:48.275 --> 22:50.186
Stepmother, indeed!

22:50.395 --> 22:53.387
Well, I'm willin' to marry 'er.
It's me that suffers by it.

22:53.475 --> 22:55.466
I'm a slave to that woman, Eliza.

22:55.555 --> 22:58.388
Just because I ain't 'er lawful 'usband.

22:58.595 --> 22:59.584
Come on.

22:59.675 --> 23:02.587
Slip your ol' dad just 'alf a crown
to go 'ome on.

23:02.915 --> 23:05.475
Well, I had a bit o' luck meself last night.

23:09.155 --> 23:12.511
But don't keep comin' around
countin' on 'alf crowns from me!

23:12.795 --> 23:15.673
Thank you, Eliza. You're a noble daughter.

23:18.435 --> 23:22.110
"Beer, beer, glorious beer

23:22.715 --> 23:24.307
"Fill yourself right up"

23:43.835 --> 23:46.190
See this creature
with her curbstone English...

23:46.275 --> 23:50.188
...that will keep her
in the gutter till the end of her days?

23:50.675 --> 23:54.304
In six months, I could pass her off
as a duchess at an Embassy Ball.

23:54.635 --> 23:57.468
I could get her a job as a lady's maid
or a shop assistant...

23:57.555 --> 23:59.625
...which requires better English.

24:07.475 --> 24:10.831
You disgrace to the noble architecture
of these columns!

24:16.795 --> 24:19.593
I could get her a job as a lady's maid
or a shop assistant...

24:19.675 --> 24:21.745
...which requires better English.

24:47.195 --> 24:49.231
How many vowel sounds
did you hear altogether?

24:49.315 --> 24:50.953
I believe I counted 24.

24:51.075 --> 24:54.033
Wrong by 100. To be exact you heard 130.

24:54.595 --> 24:56.153
Listen to them one at a time.

24:56.235 --> 24:59.113
Must I? I'm really quite done up
for one morning.

25:22.315 --> 25:23.714
Your name, please?

25:24.355 --> 25:25.629
Your name, miss?

25:25.715 --> 25:28.513
My name is of no concern to you
whatsoever.

25:28.635 --> 25:30.353
One moment, please.

25:38.995 --> 25:41.509
London is gettin' so dirty these days.

25:42.075 --> 25:45.147
I'm Mrs. Pearce, the housekeeper.
Can I help you?

25:45.395 --> 25:48.865
Good morning, missus.
I'd like to see the professor, please.

25:48.995 --> 25:50.508
Could you tell me what it's about?

25:50.595 --> 25:53.268
It's business of a personal nature.

25:55.235 --> 25:56.668
One moment, please.

26:05.875 --> 26:08.435
-Mr. Higgins?
-What is it, Mrs. Pearce?

26:08.515 --> 26:10.949
There's a young woman
who wants to see you, sir.

26:11.035 --> 26:12.184
A young woman?

26:13.315 --> 26:14.270
What does she want?

26:14.355 --> 26:16.994
She's quite a common girl, sir.
Very common indeed.

26:17.075 --> 26:19.031
I should've sent her away, only I thought...

26:19.115 --> 26:21.026
...you wanted her to talk
into your machine.

26:21.115 --> 26:23.788
-Has she an interesting accent?
-Simply ghastly.

26:23.875 --> 26:26.753
Good. Let's have her in.
Show her in, Mrs. Pearce.

26:27.515 --> 26:30.825
This is rather a bit of luck.
I'll show you how I make records.

26:30.915 --> 26:34.669
We'll set her talking, then I'll take
her down first in Bell's Visible Speech...

26:34.755 --> 26:37.792
...then in broad Romic.
Then we'll get her on the phonograph...

26:37.875 --> 26:42.107
...so you can turn her on when you want
with the written transcript before you.

26:45.235 --> 26:46.953
This is the young woman, sir.

26:47.035 --> 26:48.263
Good mornin', my good man.

26:48.355 --> 26:50.186
Might I 'ave a word with you?

26:50.275 --> 26:52.664
Oh, no. This is the girl
I jotted down last night.

26:52.755 --> 26:55.872
She's no use. I got the records I want
of the Lisson Grove lingo.

26:55.955 --> 26:57.786
I won't waste another cylinder on that.

26:57.875 --> 26:59.433
Be off with you. I don't want you.

26:59.515 --> 27:02.552
Don't be so saucy.
You ain't 'eard what I come for yet.

27:02.715 --> 27:04.433
Did you tell 'im I come in a taxi?

27:04.515 --> 27:07.427
Nonsense. Do you think a gentleman
like Mr. Higgins cares...

27:07.515 --> 27:08.630
...what you came in?

27:08.715 --> 27:10.228
Oh, we are proud.

27:10.395 --> 27:13.512
He ain't above givin' lessons, not 'im.
I 'eard 'im say so.

27:13.595 --> 27:15.586
I ain't come here to ask
for any compliment...

27:15.675 --> 27:18.314
...and if my money's not good enough,
I can go elsewhere.

27:18.395 --> 27:19.794
Good enough for what?

27:19.875 --> 27:21.547
Good enough for you.

27:22.635 --> 27:25.354
Now you know, don't ya?
I'm come to 'ave lessons.

27:25.435 --> 27:27.869
And to pay for 'em, too, make no mistake.

27:27.995 --> 27:28.950
Well!

27:29.715 --> 27:32.149
And what do you expect me to say?

27:32.915 --> 27:36.271
Well, if you was a gentleman,
you might ask me to sit down, I think.

27:36.355 --> 27:38.949
Don't I tell you I'm bringin' you business?

27:39.675 --> 27:41.552
Should we ask this baggage to sit down...

27:41.635 --> 27:43.944
...or shall we just throw her
out of the window?

27:44.035 --> 27:47.914
I won't be called a baggage.
Not when I've offered to pay like any lady.

27:49.075 --> 27:50.793
What do you want, my girl?

27:54.755 --> 27:56.507
I want to be a lady in a flow'r shop...

27:56.595 --> 27:59.314
...'stead of sellin' at the corner
of Tottenham Court Road.

27:59.395 --> 28:02.034
But they won't take me
unless I can talk more genteel.

28:02.115 --> 28:03.343
He said 'e could teach me.

28:03.435 --> 28:05.426
Well, 'ere I am ready to pay 'im.

28:05.515 --> 28:08.632
Not asking any favor
and he treats me as if I was dirt.

28:09.275 --> 28:12.984
I know what lessons cost as well as you do
and I'm ready to pay.

28:15.835 --> 28:17.109
How much?

28:17.555 --> 28:19.193
Now you're talkin'.

28:19.395 --> 28:21.829
I thought you'd come off it
for a chance to get back...

28:21.915 --> 28:23.951
...a bit of what you chucked
at me last night.

28:24.035 --> 28:25.673
You'd had a drop in, 'adn't you?

28:25.755 --> 28:26.904
Sit down.

28:27.035 --> 28:30.107
-lf you're goin' t' make a compliment of it--
-Sit down!

28:31.035 --> 28:33.151
Sit down, girl. Do as you're told.

28:33.675 --> 28:34.994
What's your name?

28:35.115 --> 28:36.946
Eliza Doolittle.

28:37.595 --> 28:39.950
Won't you sit down, Miss Doolittle?

28:43.675 --> 28:45.188
I don't mind if I do.

28:48.595 --> 28:51.587
How much do you propose
to pay me for these lessons?

28:51.795 --> 28:53.228
Oh, I know what's right.

28:53.315 --> 28:56.068
My lady friend gets French lessons
for 18 pence an hour...

28:56.155 --> 28:57.986
...from a real French gentleman.

28:58.075 --> 29:00.305
You wouldn't have the face
to ask me the same...

29:00.395 --> 29:03.114
...for teachin' me my own language
as you would for French.

29:03.195 --> 29:06.426
I won't give more than a shillin'.
Take it or leave it.

29:08.475 --> 29:11.433
Do you know, Pickering,
if you think of a shilling...

29:11.675 --> 29:15.588
...not as a simple shilling,
but as a percentage of this girl's income...

29:15.915 --> 29:18.509
...it works out as fully equivalent of...

29:20.155 --> 29:22.510
...60 or 70 pounds from a millionaire.

29:23.315 --> 29:26.591
By George, it's enormous.
It's the biggest offer I ever had.

29:26.675 --> 29:30.714
Sixty pounds? What are you talkin' about?
Where would I get 60 pounds?

29:30.795 --> 29:33.070
-I never offered you 60 pounds!
-Hold your tongue!

29:33.155 --> 29:34.713
But I ain't got 60 pounds!

29:34.795 --> 29:38.424
Don't cry, silly girl. Sit down.
Nobody's going to touch your money.

29:38.515 --> 29:41.712
Somebody'll touch you with a broomstick
if you don't stop sniveling.

29:41.795 --> 29:42.910
Sit down!

29:46.715 --> 29:49.149
Anybody'd think you was my father!

29:49.275 --> 29:52.745
If I decide to teach you,
I'll be worse than two fathers to you.

29:53.515 --> 29:54.470
Here.

29:54.755 --> 29:55.744
What's this for?

29:55.835 --> 29:59.464
To wipe your eyes. To wipe any part
of your face that feels moist.

29:59.675 --> 30:02.394
Remember, that's your handkerchief
and that's your sleeve.

30:02.475 --> 30:05.911
Don't confuse one with the other,
if you want to become a lady in a shop.

30:05.995 --> 30:09.670
It's no use to talk to her like that.
She doesn't understand you.

30:09.755 --> 30:13.225
Give the 'andkerchief to me.
He give it to me, not to you!

30:13.395 --> 30:15.306
Higgins, I'm interested.

30:15.475 --> 30:16.703
What about your boast...

30:16.795 --> 30:19.548
...you could pass her off as a duchess
at the Embassy Ball?

30:19.635 --> 30:22.354
I'll say you're the greatest teacher alive
if you do that.

30:22.435 --> 30:26.394
I'll bet you all the expenses
of the experiment that you can't do it.

30:26.595 --> 30:28.233
I'll even pay for the lessons.

30:28.315 --> 30:30.909
You're real good. Thank ye, Capt'n.

30:32.275 --> 30:34.152
It's almost irresistible.

30:36.755 --> 30:38.950
She's so deliciously low.

30:39.035 --> 30:40.514
So horribly dirty.

30:40.635 --> 30:44.025
I ain't dirty! I washed my face an' hands
before I come, I did.

30:44.115 --> 30:47.903
I'll take it. I'll make a duchess
of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.

30:48.275 --> 30:51.665
We'll start today. This moment.
Take her away and clean her.

30:51.755 --> 30:55.031
Sandpaper, if it won't come off.
Is there a fire in the kitchen?

30:55.115 --> 30:58.027
Take her clothes off and burn them
and order some new ones.

30:58.115 --> 31:00.629
Just wrap her in brown paper
till they come.

31:01.115 --> 31:04.551
You're no gentleman, you're not,
to talk o' such things.

31:04.635 --> 31:06.068
I'm a good girl, I am.

31:06.155 --> 31:08.828
And I know what the likes of you are, I do.

31:09.475 --> 31:12.547
We want none of your slum prudery here,
young woman.

31:12.795 --> 31:14.945
You've got to learn to behave
like a duchess.

31:15.035 --> 31:18.345
Take her away, Mrs. Pearce.
If she gives you any trouble, wallop her.

31:18.435 --> 31:20.187
I'll call the police, I will.

31:20.275 --> 31:21.833
I've got no place to put her.

31:21.915 --> 31:23.792
Well, put her in the dustbin.

31:24.715 --> 31:26.626
Come, Higgins, be reasonable.

31:26.715 --> 31:29.183
You must be reasonable,
Mr. Higgins, you must.

31:29.275 --> 31:31.664
You can't walk over everybody like this.

31:34.315 --> 31:35.304
I?

31:36.075 --> 31:37.793
Walk over everybody?

31:37.875 --> 31:41.868
My dear Mrs. Pearce, my dear Pickering,
I had no intention of walking over anybody.

31:41.955 --> 31:44.992
I merely suggested we should be kind
to this poor girl.

31:45.115 --> 31:49.472
I didn't express myself clearly
because I didn't wish to hurt her delicacy...

31:49.875 --> 31:50.944
...or yours.

31:51.035 --> 31:53.993
But, sir, you can't take a girl up like that...

31:54.155 --> 31:56.669
...as if you were picking up
a pebble on the beach.

31:56.755 --> 31:57.870
Why not?

31:58.035 --> 32:00.708
Why not? But you don't know
anything about her.

32:00.795 --> 32:03.468
What about her parents?
She may be married.

32:03.675 --> 32:04.869
Garn!

32:05.195 --> 32:08.153
There. As the girl
very properly says, "garn! "

32:08.915 --> 32:10.507
Who'd marry me?

32:12.835 --> 32:14.553
By George, Eliza...

32:15.315 --> 32:18.591
...the streets will be strewn
with the bodies of men...

32:18.755 --> 32:22.191
...shooting themselves for your sake
before I'm done with you.

32:24.715 --> 32:25.830
I'm goin'.

32:26.115 --> 32:29.505
He's off his chump, he is.
I don't want no balmies teachin' me.

32:29.595 --> 32:32.632
Mad? All right, Mrs. Pearce,
don't order those new clothes.

32:32.715 --> 32:34.831
-Throw her out.
-Stop! I won't allow it.

32:34.915 --> 32:36.348
Go home to your parents, girl.

32:36.435 --> 32:38.107
I ain't got no parents.

32:38.315 --> 32:40.146
She ain't got no parents. What's the fuss?

32:40.235 --> 32:43.511
Nobody wants her. She's no use
to anyone but me. Take her upstairs!

32:43.595 --> 32:45.950
What's to become of her?
Is she to be paid anything?

32:46.035 --> 32:47.548
Do be sensible, sir.

32:47.835 --> 32:50.224
What'd she do with money?
She'll have food and clothes.

32:50.315 --> 32:51.828
She'll drink if you give her money.

32:51.915 --> 32:53.587
You are a brute! It's a lie!

32:53.675 --> 32:56.064
Nobody ever saw the sign o' liquor on me.

32:56.155 --> 32:59.113
Sir, you're a gentleman.
Don't let 'im speak to me like that!

32:59.195 --> 33:02.267
Does it occur to you, Higgins,
the girl has some feelings?

33:02.355 --> 33:05.347
No, I don't think so.
No feelings we need worry about.

33:05.555 --> 33:06.590
Well, have you, Eliza?

33:06.675 --> 33:08.905
I got me feelings same as anyone else.

33:08.995 --> 33:12.146
Mr. Higgins, I must know on what terms
the girl is to be here.

33:12.235 --> 33:14.544
What'll become of her
when you've finished teaching?

33:14.635 --> 33:16.387
You must look ahead a little, sir.

33:16.475 --> 33:19.592
What'll become of her if we leave her
in the gutter, Mrs. Pearce?

33:19.675 --> 33:21.905
That's her own business,
not yours, Mr. Higgins.

33:21.995 --> 33:23.474
When I'm done, we'll throw her back.

33:23.555 --> 33:26.752
Then it'll be her own business again.
That'll be all right, won't it?

33:26.835 --> 33:29.065
You've no feelin' 'eart in ya!

33:29.555 --> 33:31.944
You don't care for nothin' but yourself.

33:32.155 --> 33:34.271
I've 'ad enough of this. I'm goin'!

33:34.355 --> 33:36.311
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!

33:36.395 --> 33:38.226
Have some chocolates, Eliza.

33:44.715 --> 33:46.353
'Ow do I know what might be in 'em?

33:46.435 --> 33:49.427
I've 'eard of girls bein' drugged
by the likes o' you.

33:49.795 --> 33:51.308
Pledge of good faith.

33:51.955 --> 33:53.434
I'll take one half.

33:54.275 --> 33:55.913
And you take the other.

33:59.235 --> 34:02.193
You'll have boxes of them,
barrels of them every day.

34:02.555 --> 34:04.193
You'll live on them, eh?

34:05.595 --> 34:08.985
I wouldn't 've ate it, only I'm too ladylike
to take it out o' me mouth.

34:09.074 --> 34:12.431
Think of it, Eliza.
Think of chocolates, and taxis...

34:12.755 --> 34:15.030
...and gold and diamonds.

34:16.355 --> 34:19.949
I don't want no gold and no diamonds.
I'm a good girl, I am.

34:20.315 --> 34:23.466
Higgins, I really must interfere.
Mrs. Pearce is quite right.

34:23.554 --> 34:26.433
If this girl will put herself
in your hands for six months...

34:26.514 --> 34:30.871
...for an experiment in teaching, she must
understand thoroughly what she's doing.

34:34.835 --> 34:36.871
You are to stay here
for the next six months...

34:36.955 --> 34:40.789
...learning how to speak beautifully
like a lady in a florist shop.

34:41.955 --> 34:45.504
If you're good and do what you're told,
you'll sleep in a proper bedroom...

34:45.594 --> 34:49.713
...have lots to eat, money
to buy chocolates and take rides in taxis.

34:50.835 --> 34:53.110
But if you are naughty and idle...

34:53.195 --> 34:55.914
...you'll sleep in the kitchen
amongst the black beetles...

34:55.995 --> 34:58.907
...and be walloped by Mrs. Pearce
with a broomstick.

35:00.195 --> 35:03.870
At the end of six months,
you shall be taken to Buckingham Palace...

35:04.195 --> 35:06.504
...in a carriage, beautifully dressed.

35:07.675 --> 35:10.508
If the king finds out
that you are not a lady...

35:10.675 --> 35:14.748
...the police will take you to the Tower
of London where your head will be cut off...

35:14.835 --> 35:17.713
...as a warning to other
presumptuous flower girls.

35:18.675 --> 35:21.985
But if you are not found out,
you shall have a present of...

35:23.035 --> 35:26.107
...seven and six to start life with
as a lady in a shop.

35:27.355 --> 35:29.232
If you refuse this offer...

35:29.315 --> 35:33.103
...you will be the most ungrateful,
wicked girl...

35:33.595 --> 35:36.985
...and the angels will weep for you!

35:41.875 --> 35:43.194
Are you satisfied, Pickering?

35:43.275 --> 35:45.266
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

35:45.355 --> 35:47.710
Could I put it more plainly or fairly,
Mrs. Pearce?

35:47.795 --> 35:48.671
Come with me.

35:48.755 --> 35:51.394
That's right.
Bundle her off to the bathroom.

35:51.475 --> 35:53.306
You're a great bully, you are!

35:53.395 --> 35:56.512
I won't stay here if I don't like it.
I won't let nobody wallop me!

35:56.595 --> 35:58.233
Don't answer back, girl.

35:59.795 --> 36:02.025
I've always been a good girl, I 'ave.

36:03.155 --> 36:06.272
In six months...in three,
if she has a good ear and a quick tongue...

36:06.355 --> 36:08.994
...l'll take her anywhere
and I'll pass her off as anything.

36:09.075 --> 36:11.635
I'll make a queen of that barbarous wretch!

36:18.395 --> 36:21.626
I've never had a bath in me life.
Not what you'd call a proper one.

36:21.715 --> 36:25.230
You know you can't be a nice girl inside
if you're dirty outside.

36:25.875 --> 36:28.947
I'll have to put you in here.
This will be your bedroom.

36:32.595 --> 36:34.745
I couldn't sleep in here, missus.

36:34.835 --> 36:36.905
It's too good for the likes o' me.

36:38.795 --> 36:40.786
I should be afraid to touch anythin'.

36:40.875 --> 36:42.866
I ain't a duchess yet, you know.

36:49.115 --> 36:51.504
What's this?
This where you wash clothes?

36:51.595 --> 36:55.474
This is where we wash ourselves, Eliza.
And where I'm going to wash you.

36:56.035 --> 36:59.107
You expect me to get into that
and wet meself all over?

36:59.195 --> 37:00.264
Not me!

37:06.475 --> 37:08.227
I shall catch me death.

37:10.635 --> 37:11.863
Come along now.

37:12.435 --> 37:13.550
Come along.

37:14.075 --> 37:15.633
Take your clothes off.

37:16.715 --> 37:19.434
Come on, girl, do as you're told.
Take your clothes off.

37:19.515 --> 37:21.790
Here, come on. Help me take these--

37:28.075 --> 37:30.145
Take your hands off me!

37:49.275 --> 37:52.073
I'm a good girl, I am!

37:54.475 --> 37:57.228
It ain't right! It ain't decent!

38:03.315 --> 38:04.907
Get your hands off me!

38:12.555 --> 38:14.307
I'm a good girl, I am!

38:27.635 --> 38:30.354
Forgive the bluntness,
but if I'm to be in this business...

38:30.435 --> 38:32.266
...I shall feel responsible for the girl.

38:32.355 --> 38:36.143
I hope it's clearly understood that
no advantage is to be taken of her position.

38:36.235 --> 38:38.795
What, that thing? Sacred, I assure you.

38:38.875 --> 38:41.753
Come now, you know what I mean.
This is no trifling matter.

38:41.835 --> 38:45.145
Are you a man of good character
where women are concerned?

38:46.115 --> 38:49.266
Have you ever met a man of good
character where women are concerned?

38:49.355 --> 38:51.266
Yes, very frequently.

38:51.435 --> 38:54.632
I haven't. The moment I let a woman
make friends with me...

38:54.715 --> 38:56.910
...she becomes jealous, exacting...

38:56.995 --> 38:59.145
...suspicious and a damned nuisance.

38:59.395 --> 39:03.354
The moment that I make friends with
a woman I become selfish and tyrannical.

39:03.435 --> 39:06.871
So here I am, a confirmed old bachelor
and likely to remain so.

39:07.115 --> 39:09.026
Well, after all, Pickering....

39:09.515 --> 39:11.153
"I'm an ordinary man

39:11.435 --> 39:13.505
"Who desires nothing more

39:13.715 --> 39:15.592
"Than just an ordinary chance

39:15.835 --> 39:17.951
"To live exactly as he likes

39:18.035 --> 39:20.105
"And do precisely what he wants

39:20.355 --> 39:22.266
"An average man, am I

39:22.475 --> 39:24.386
"Of no eccentric whim

39:24.715 --> 39:26.433
"Who likes to live his life

39:26.515 --> 39:27.709
"Free of strife

39:27.795 --> 39:30.468
"Doing whatever he thinks is best for him

39:32.715 --> 39:34.785
"Oh, just an ordinary man

39:37.515 --> 39:39.585
"But let a woman in your life

39:40.315 --> 39:42.146
"And your serenity is through

39:43.115 --> 39:45.754
"She'll redecorate your home
From the cellar to the dome

39:45.835 --> 39:49.191
"Then go on to the enthralling fun
of overhauling you!

39:51.075 --> 39:52.747
"Let a woman in your life

39:53.395 --> 39:55.306
"And you are up against a wall

39:56.155 --> 39:58.908
"Make a plan and you will find
She has something else in mind

39:58.995 --> 40:01.634
"So rather than do either
You do something else that neither

40:01.715 --> 40:02.909
"Likes at all!

40:04.235 --> 40:06.385
"You want to talk of Keats or Milton

40:07.075 --> 40:09.031
"She only wants to talk of love

40:09.515 --> 40:11.710
"You go to see a play or ballet

40:12.075 --> 40:14.305
"And spend it searching for her glove

40:14.795 --> 40:16.467
"Let a woman in your life

40:17.075 --> 40:19.031
"And you invite eternal strife

40:20.435 --> 40:22.790
"Let them buy their wedding bands

40:23.155 --> 40:25.715
"For those anxious little hands

40:26.195 --> 40:29.107
"I'd be equally as willing
For a dentist to be drilling

40:29.195 --> 40:32.073
"Than to ever let a woman in my life!

40:34.755 --> 40:36.666
"I'm a very gentle man

40:37.355 --> 40:41.030
"Even-tempered and good-natured
Whom you never hear complain

40:41.395 --> 40:45.388
"Who has the milk of human kindness
By the quart in every vein

40:45.795 --> 40:49.470
"A patient man am I
Down to my fingertips

40:49.955 --> 40:52.674
"The sort who never could
Ever would

40:53.115 --> 40:55.868
"Let an insulting remark escape his lips

40:58.915 --> 41:00.667
"A very gentle man

41:02.875 --> 41:04.911
"But let a woman in your life

41:05.555 --> 41:07.625
"And patience hasn't got a chance

41:08.435 --> 41:11.108
"She will beg you for advice
Your reply will be concise

41:11.195 --> 41:12.344
"And she'll listen very nicely

41:12.435 --> 41:15.108
"Then go out and do precisely
What she wants!

41:16.475 --> 41:18.784
"You were a man of grace and polish

41:19.155 --> 41:21.032
"Who never spoke above a hush

41:21.795 --> 41:24.104
"Now all at once you're using language

41:24.395 --> 41:26.750
"That would make a sailor blush

41:27.155 --> 41:28.907
"Let a woman in your life

41:29.515 --> 41:31.506
"And you're plunging in a knife!

41:32.875 --> 41:35.230
"Let the others of my sex

41:35.555 --> 41:38.149
"Tie the knot around their necks

41:38.515 --> 41:41.666
"I'd prefer a new edition
Of the Spanish Inquisition

41:41.755 --> 41:44.713
"Than to ever let a woman in my life

41:47.715 --> 41:49.626
"I'm a quiet-living man

41:49.995 --> 41:51.951
"Who prefers to spend the evenings

41:52.035 --> 41:53.866
"In the silence of his room

41:54.115 --> 41:56.345
"Who likes an atmosphere as restful

41:56.675 --> 41:58.313
"As an undiscovered tomb

41:58.555 --> 42:02.025
"A pensive man am I
Of philosophic joys

42:02.715 --> 42:05.468
"Who likes to meditate, contemplate

42:05.915 --> 42:09.032
"Free from humanity's mad, inhuman noise

"A quiet-living man

"But let a woman in your life

"And your sabbatical is through

42:21.915 --> 42:24.429
"In a line that never ends
Come an army of her friends

42:24.515 --> 42:26.585
"Come to jabber and to chatter
And to tell her

42:26.675 --> 42:28.552
"What the matter is with you!

42:29.635 --> 42:32.069
"She'll have a booming, boisterous family

42:32.275 --> 42:34.584
"Who will descend on you en masse

42:34.955 --> 42:37.230
"She'll have a large, Wagnerian mother

42:37.515 --> 42:39.710
"With a voice that shatters glass!

42:40.035 --> 42:41.707
"Let a woman in your life

"I shall never let a woman...

43:06.155 --> 43:07.747
"...in my life! "

43:11.035 --> 43:13.310
Get out of 'ere. Jamie, you get out, too!

43:13.635 --> 43:17.947
Come on, Doolittle. And remember,
drinks is to be paid for or not drunk.

43:19.475 --> 43:21.625
Thanks for your 'ospitality, George.

43:21.955 --> 43:24.025
Send the bill to Buckingham Palace.

43:24.115 --> 43:27.425
Well, Alfie, there's nothin' else to do.
I guess it's back to work.

43:27.515 --> 43:31.064
Work! Don't you dare mention
that word in my presence again.

43:31.395 --> 43:33.909
Look at all these poor blighters down here.

43:34.755 --> 43:37.827
I used to do that sort of thing once.
Just for exercise.

43:38.395 --> 43:40.955
It's not worth it. Takes up your whole day.

43:41.315 --> 43:43.829
Don't worry, boys.
We'll get outta this somehow.

43:43.915 --> 43:45.746
How do you think you'll do that?

43:45.835 --> 43:47.871
How? Same as always.

43:48.075 --> 43:50.350
Faith, hope and a little bit o' luck.

43:51.475 --> 43:54.592
"The Lord above gave man an arm of iron

What are you doing in Eliza's house?

46:22.715 --> 46:24.990
Her former residence!

46:25.355 --> 46:27.710
You can buy your own drinks now,
Alfie Doolittle.

46:27.795 --> 46:29.672
Fallen into a tub of butter, you have.

46:29.755 --> 46:30.983
What are you talkin' about?

46:31.075 --> 46:32.303
Your daughter, Eliza.

46:32.395 --> 46:34.750
You're a lucky man, Alfie Doolittle.

46:34.875 --> 46:36.194
What about Eliza?

46:37.195 --> 46:40.073
He don't know.
Her own father an' he don't know.

46:44.115 --> 46:46.185
Moved in with a swell, Eliza has.

46:46.275 --> 46:49.153
Left here in a taxi all by herself,
smart as paint.

46:49.395 --> 46:51.465
An' ain't been home for three days.

46:51.555 --> 46:52.385
Go on.

46:52.475 --> 46:54.591
And this mornin' I gets a message from 'er.

46:54.675 --> 46:56.791
She wants her things sent over...

46:57.035 --> 46:59.833
...to 27 A Wimpole Street...

47:00.155 --> 47:02.146
...care of Professor Higgins.

47:03.515 --> 47:05.426
An' what things does she want?

47:05.955 --> 47:09.868
Her birdcage and her Chinese fan.

47:12.115 --> 47:13.343
But she says:

47:13.835 --> 47:16.986
"Never mind about sending any clothes."

47:20.475 --> 47:23.114
I knew she had a career in front of 'er.

47:23.355 --> 47:25.710
We're in for a booze-up.

47:25.795 --> 47:28.628
The sun is shining on Alfred P. Doolittle.

47:29.275 --> 47:32.506
"A man was made
to 'elp support his children

47:33.115 --> 47:35.948
"Which is the right and proper thing to do

47:36.675 --> 47:40.304
"A man was made
to 'elp support his children, but

47:40.875 --> 47:43.992
"With a little bit o' luck
With a little bit o' luck

47:44.315 --> 47:47.193
"They'll go out and start supportin' you

47:48.155 --> 47:49.588
"With a little bit

47:49.955 --> 47:51.354
"With a little bit

47:51.795 --> 47:54.548
"With a little bit o' luck they'll work for you

47:55.515 --> 47:57.107
"With a little bit

47:57.315 --> 47:58.748
"With a little bit

47:59.195 --> 48:02.232
"With a little bit o' bloomin' luck!

48:09.995 --> 48:13.226
"It's a crime for a man to go philanderin'

48:13.595 --> 48:16.632
"And fill his wife's poor 'eart
with grief and doubt

48:17.235 --> 48:20.784
"It's a crime for a man
to go philanderin', but

48:21.275 --> 48:24.472
"With a little bit o' luck
With a little bit o' luck

48:24.755 --> 48:27.667
"You can see the bloodhounds
don't find out!

48:28.555 --> 48:30.068
"With a little bit

48:30.315 --> 48:31.748
"With a little bit

48:32.195 --> 48:34.868
"With a little bit o' luck
She won't find out!

48:39.435 --> 48:42.393
"With a little bit o' bloomin' luck! "

48:57.995 --> 48:59.189
The mail, sir.

48:59.515 --> 49:02.075
Pay the bills and say no to the invitations.

49:45.475 --> 49:47.909
You simply cannot go on
working the girl this way.

49:47.995 --> 49:50.190
Making her say her alphabet
over and over...

49:50.275 --> 49:52.914
...from sunup to sundown,
even during meals.

49:53.075 --> 49:55.543
You'll exhaust yourself. When will it stop?

49:55.635 --> 49:59.071
When she does it properly, of course.
Is that all, Mrs. Pearce?

49:59.155 --> 50:02.511
There's another letter from the
American millionaire, Ezra D. Wallingford.

50:02.595 --> 50:04.711
He still wants you
for his Moral Reform League.

50:04.795 --> 50:05.830
Throw it away.

50:05.915 --> 50:09.271
It's the third letter he's written you.
You should at least answer it.

50:09.355 --> 50:13.109
All right, leave it on the desk, Mrs. Pearce.
I'll try and get to it.

50:15.195 --> 50:19.074
If you please, sir. There's a dustman
downstairs, Alfred P. Doolittle...

50:19.195 --> 50:22.073
...who wants to see you.
He says you have his daughter here.

50:22.155 --> 50:23.349
I say!

50:24.515 --> 50:26.392
Well, send the blackguard up.

50:26.515 --> 50:28.392
He may not be a blackguard, Higgins.

50:28.475 --> 50:31.035
Nonsense. Of course
he's a blackguard, Pickering.

50:31.115 --> 50:33.390
I'm afraid we'll have some trouble
with him.

50:33.475 --> 50:37.787
No, I think not. Any trouble to be had,
he'll have it with me. Not I with him.

50:40.915 --> 50:42.268
Doolittle, sir.

50:48.435 --> 50:50.426
-Professor Higgins?
-Here!

50:51.555 --> 50:52.544
Where?

50:53.075 --> 50:54.872
Good morning, Governor.

50:55.275 --> 50:58.187
I come about a very serious matter,
Governor.

51:01.555 --> 51:03.511
Brought up in Houndslow.

51:04.155 --> 51:06.032
Mother Welsh, I should think.

51:06.995 --> 51:08.508
What is it you want, Doolittle?

51:08.595 --> 51:11.029
I want my daughter, that's what I want.
See?

51:11.115 --> 51:13.504
Of course you do.
You're her father, aren't you?

51:13.595 --> 51:16.109
I'm glad to see you have a spark
of family feeling left.

51:16.195 --> 51:18.709
She's in there. Yes, take her away at once.

51:18.875 --> 51:19.864
What?

51:20.395 --> 51:24.183
Take her away. Do you think I am going
to keep your daughter for you?

51:24.315 --> 51:26.954
Now, is this reasonable, Governor?

51:27.115 --> 51:30.027
Is it fairity to take advantage
of a man like that?

51:30.195 --> 51:33.312
The girl belongs to me. You got 'er.
Where do I come in?

51:33.755 --> 51:37.270
How dare you come here
and attempt to blackmail me!

51:37.835 --> 51:39.712
You sent her here on purpose!

51:39.835 --> 51:42.986
Don't take a man up like that, Governor.

51:43.155 --> 51:45.225
The police shall take you up.
This is a plan...

51:45.315 --> 51:47.590
...a plot to extort money by threats.

51:47.675 --> 51:49.552
I shall telephone the police.

51:49.675 --> 51:52.553
Have I asked you for a brass farthin'?

51:53.035 --> 51:56.471
I leave it to this gentleman 'ere.
Have I said a word about money?

51:56.555 --> 51:58.625
Well, what else did you come for?

52:00.435 --> 52:02.346
What would a bloke come for?

52:02.715 --> 52:04.546
Be 'uman, Governor.

52:09.435 --> 52:12.268
Alfred, you sent her here on purpose.

52:12.395 --> 52:13.987
So help me, Governor, I never did.

52:14.075 --> 52:15.428
How did you know she was here?

52:15.515 --> 52:18.268
I'd tell you, Governor,
if you'd let me get a word in.

52:18.355 --> 52:21.108
I'm willing to tell ya.
I'm wanting to tell ya.

52:21.355 --> 52:23.073
I'm waiting to tell ya!

52:24.715 --> 52:28.594
You know, Pickering, this chap's got
a certain natural gift of rhetoric.

52:28.795 --> 52:31.593
Observe the rhythm
of his native woodnotes wild.

52:31.835 --> 52:35.623
"I'm willing to tell you. I'm wanting
to tell you. I'm waiting to tell you."

52:35.715 --> 52:37.785
That's the Welsh strain in 'im.

52:38.035 --> 52:40.549
How did you know Eliza was here
if you didn't send 'er?

52:40.635 --> 52:43.991
Well, she sent back for her luggage
and I got to 'ear about it.

52:44.075 --> 52:46.669
She said she didn't want no clothes.

52:47.275 --> 52:51.746
What was I to think from that, Governor?
I ask you, as a parent, what was I to think?

52:52.195 --> 52:55.790
So you came here to rescue her
from worse than death, eh?

52:56.115 --> 52:58.504
-Yes, sir, Governor. That's right.
-Yes.

52:58.875 --> 53:00.228
Mrs. Pearce!

53:01.595 --> 53:04.905
Eliza's father has come to take her away.
Give her to him, will you?

53:04.995 --> 53:08.271
Now wait a minute, Governor.
Wait a minute.

53:09.195 --> 53:11.755
You and me is men o' the world, ain't we?

53:12.235 --> 53:16.148
Men of the world, are we?
Perhaps you'd better go, Mrs. Pearce.

53:16.235 --> 53:17.873
I think so indeed, sir!

53:18.275 --> 53:19.503
Here, Governor.

53:19.915 --> 53:22.713
I've took a sort of a fancy to you and...

53:25.915 --> 53:29.146
...if you want the girl, I ain't so set
on 'avin' her home again...

53:29.235 --> 53:32.033
...but what I might be open to
is an arrangement.

53:32.435 --> 53:34.744
All I ask is my rights as a father.

53:34.835 --> 53:38.350
You're the last man alive to expect me
to let her go for nothing.

53:38.675 --> 53:41.792
I can see you're a straight sort, Governor.

53:41.875 --> 53:42.864
So...

53:43.115 --> 53:46.744
...what's a five pound note to you?
An' what's Eliza to me?

53:47.355 --> 53:48.993
I think you should know, Doolittle...

53:49.075 --> 53:52.112
...that Mr. Higgins' intentions
are entirely honorable.

53:52.475 --> 53:56.150
Of course they are, Governor.
If I thought they wasn't, I'd ask 50.

53:56.635 --> 53:59.354
You mean, you'd sell your daughter
for 50 pounds?

53:59.435 --> 54:01.107
Have you no morals, man?

54:03.995 --> 54:07.908
No, I can't afford 'em, Governor. Neither
could you if you was as poor as me.

54:07.995 --> 54:10.111
Not that I mean any 'arm, but...

54:10.195 --> 54:13.551
...if Eliza is gonna have a bit out o' this,
why not me, too?

54:14.795 --> 54:15.830
Why not?

54:18.635 --> 54:21.024
Look at it my way. What am I?

54:21.995 --> 54:25.908
I ask ya, what am I? I'm one
o' the undeserving poor, that's what I am.

54:25.995 --> 54:27.951
Think what that means to a man.

54:28.035 --> 54:31.584
It means he's up against
middle-class morality for all the time.

54:32.155 --> 54:35.943
If there's anything goin' an' I ask
for a bit of it, it's always the same story:

54:36.035 --> 54:38.549
"You're undeservin', so you can't have it."

54:38.715 --> 54:42.549
But my needs is as great as the most
deservin' widows that ever got money...

54:42.635 --> 54:46.947
...out of six different charities in one week
for the death o' the same 'usband.

54:47.035 --> 54:50.391
I don't need less than a deservin' man,
I need more.

54:50.835 --> 54:53.713
I don't eat less 'earty than he does
and I drink...

54:54.475 --> 54:55.669
...a lot more.

54:55.955 --> 54:57.866
I'm playin' straight with you.

54:57.955 --> 55:01.504
I ain't pretendin' to be deservin'.
No, I'm undeservin'...

55:01.995 --> 55:05.874
...and I mean to go on bein' undeservin'.
I like it an' that's the truth.

55:05.955 --> 55:09.391
But will you take advantage
of a man's nature...

55:09.635 --> 55:12.945
...do him out of the price of
his own daughter, what he's brought up...

55:13.035 --> 55:15.629
...fed and clothed
by the sweat of his brow...

55:16.315 --> 55:20.786
...till she's growed big enough
to be interestin' to you two gentlemen?

55:22.635 --> 55:25.832
Is five pounds unreasonable,
I put it to you?

55:26.195 --> 55:27.753
And I leave it to you.

55:30.475 --> 55:33.911
You know, Pickering, if we took this man
in hand for three months...

55:33.995 --> 55:38.227
...he could choose between a seat in
the Cabinet and a popular pulpit in Wales.

55:38.635 --> 55:42.230
-We'd better give 'im a fiver.
-He'll make bad use of it, I'm afraid.

55:42.315 --> 55:44.271
Not me, Governor, so 'elp me I won't.

55:44.355 --> 55:46.744
Just one good spree
for meself an' the missus...

55:46.835 --> 55:49.793
...givin' pleasure to ourselves
and employment to others.

55:49.875 --> 55:52.628
An' satisfaction to you to know
it ain't been throwed away.

55:52.715 --> 55:54.307
You couldn't spend it better.

55:54.395 --> 55:57.034
This is irresistible. Let's give 'im ten.

55:57.395 --> 55:59.511
The missus wouldn't have the 'eart
to spend ten.

55:59.595 --> 56:01.233
Ten pounds is a lot o' money.

56:01.315 --> 56:04.705
Makes a man feel prudent-like,
and then goodbye to 'appiness.

56:05.115 --> 56:08.994
No, you just give me what I ask, Governor.
Not a penny less, not a penny more.

56:09.075 --> 56:12.272
I rather draw the line at encouraging
this sort of immorality.

56:12.355 --> 56:14.346
Why don't you marry that missus of yours?

56:14.435 --> 56:17.711
After all, marriage isn't so frightening.
You married Eliza's mother.

56:17.795 --> 56:19.353
Who told you that, Governor?

56:19.435 --> 56:22.154
Well, nobody told me.
I concluded, naturally....

56:25.915 --> 56:29.305
If we listen to this man for another minute
we'll have no convictions left.

56:29.395 --> 56:32.114
-Five pounds, I think you said.
-Thank you, Governor.

56:32.195 --> 56:33.514
Are you sure you won't have ten?

56:33.595 --> 56:35.790
No. No, perhaps another time.

56:37.675 --> 56:38.869
I beg your pardon, miss.

56:38.955 --> 56:41.594
I won't say those ruddy vowels
one more time.

56:41.675 --> 56:43.267
Blimey, it's Eliza.

56:43.555 --> 56:46.023
I never thought she'd clean up
so good-looking.

56:46.115 --> 56:48.026
She does me credit, don't she?

56:48.115 --> 56:50.549
What are you doin' here?

56:50.635 --> 56:54.913
Now, you hold your tongue and don't
you give these gentlemen none o' your lip.

56:55.435 --> 56:58.632
If you have any trouble with 'er,
give 'er a few licks o' the strap.

56:58.715 --> 57:00.910
That's the way to improve 'er mind.

57:01.195 --> 57:03.789
Well, good morning, gentlemen.
Cheerio, Eliza.

57:07.315 --> 57:10.864
There's a man for you.
A philosophical genius of the first water.

57:12.395 --> 57:14.545
Write to Mr. Ezra Wallingford
and tell him...

57:14.635 --> 57:17.832
...if he wants a lecturer, to get in touch
with Mr. Doolittle...

57:17.915 --> 57:21.544
...a common dustman, one of
the most original moralists in England.

57:21.835 --> 57:23.553
What did he come for?

57:23.795 --> 57:24.784
Say your vowels.

57:24.875 --> 57:26.831
I know me vowels.
I knew 'em before I come.

57:26.915 --> 57:28.143
If you know them, say them.

57:28.235 --> 57:31.193
Ahyee, e, iyee, ow, you.

57:32.155 --> 57:34.305
A, E, I, O, U.

57:34.755 --> 57:37.553
That's what I said. Ahyee, e, iyee, ow, you.

57:37.635 --> 57:40.354
That's what I've said for three days
an' I won't no more.

57:40.435 --> 57:43.427
I know it's difficult, Miss Doolittle,
but try to understand.

57:43.515 --> 57:46.587
There's no use explaining.
As a military man you should know that.

57:46.675 --> 57:48.154
Drilling is what she needs.

57:48.235 --> 57:50.544
Leave her alone or she'll turn to you
for sympathy.

57:50.635 --> 57:53.547
Very well, if you insist,
but have a little patience with her.

57:53.635 --> 57:54.784
Of course.

57:55.395 --> 57:56.714
Say "A."

57:56.875 --> 57:58.945
You ain't got no 'eart, you ain't.

58:06.155 --> 58:10.034
I promise you, you'll say your vowels
correctly before this day is out...

58:10.315 --> 58:14.467
...or there'll be no lunch,
no dinner, and no chocolates.

58:25.475 --> 58:28.831
"Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins
Just you wait

58:29.755 --> 58:32.906
"You'll be sorry
But your tears will be too late

58:34.075 --> 58:38.273
"You'll be broke and I'll have money
Will I help you? Don't be funny!

58:38.435 --> 58:41.472
"Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins
Just you wait

58:42.755 --> 58:45.747
"Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins
Till you're sick

58:46.995 --> 58:50.146
"And you screams
To fetch a doctor double-quick

58:51.315 --> 58:55.786
"I'll be off a second later
And go straight to the theater

58:55.915 --> 58:58.748
"Ho, ho, ho, 'Enry 'lggins
Just you wait!

59:04.355 --> 59:07.870
"Just you wait
Until we're swimmin' in the sea

59:12.595 --> 59:15.951
"And you get the cramp
a little ways from me

59:16.835 --> 59:20.828
"When you yell you're gonna drown
I'll get dressed and go to town

59:25.755 --> 59:28.474
"Just you wait!

59:32.035 --> 59:37.029
"One day I'll be famous
I'll be proper and prim

59:37.395 --> 59:42.071
"Go to St. James so often
I will call it St. Jim

59:43.035 --> 59:47.631
"One evening the king will say
'Oh, Liza, old thing

59:48.355 --> 59:53.429
"'I want all of England your praises to sing

59:54.395 --> 59:58.024
"'Next week on the 20th of May

59:58.755 --> 01:00:02.589
"'I proclaim Liza Doolittle Day

01:00:03.995 --> 01:00:08.591
"'All the people will celebrate
the glory of you

01:00:08.835 --> 01:00:13.465
"'And whatever you wish and want
I gladly will do'

01:00:14.435 --> 01:00:19.145
"'Thanks a lot, King,' says I
in a manner well-bred

01:00:20.155 --> 01:00:24.114
"'But all I want is 'Enry 'lggins' 'ead'

01:00:26.115 --> 01:00:26.865
"'Done!'

01:00:26.955 --> 01:00:29.071
"Says the king with a stroke

01:00:30.595 --> 01:00:33.473
"'Guard, run and bring in the bloke'

01:00:34.835 --> 01:00:38.430
"Then they'll march you, 'Enry 'lggins,
to the wall

01:00:39.555 --> 01:00:41.193
"And the king will tell me:

01:00:41.275 --> 01:00:43.266
"'Liza, sound the call'

01:00:44.155 --> 01:00:46.988
"As they raise their rifles higher

01:00:47.115 --> 01:00:50.585
"I'll shout: 'Ready, aim, fire!'

01:00:52.435 --> 01:00:56.030
"Ho, ho, ho, 'Enry 'lggins, down you go

01:00:57.755 --> 01:01:00.428
"Just you wait! "

01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:40.345
All right, Eliza, say it again.

01:01:41.195 --> 01:01:43.709
"The rine in Spine...

01:01:43.795 --> 01:01:46.707
"...stais minely in the pline."

01:01:47.475 --> 01:01:51.104
"The rain in Spain
stays mainly in the plain."

01:01:51.555 --> 01:01:52.624
Didn't I saiy that?

01:01:52.715 --> 01:01:56.105
No, Eliza, you didn't "saiy" that.
You didn't even "say" that.

01:01:56.475 --> 01:01:59.672
Every night before you go to bed,
where you used to say your prayers...

01:01:59.755 --> 01:02:00.904
...I want you to say:

01:02:00.995 --> 01:02:04.146
"The rain in Spain
stays mainly in the plain."

01:02:04.315 --> 01:02:05.430
Fifty times.

01:02:05.955 --> 01:02:09.948
You'll get much further with the Lord
if you learn not to offend His ears.

01:02:10.675 --> 01:02:12.108
Now for your "H's."

01:02:13.275 --> 01:02:15.152
Pickering, this is going to be ghastly.

01:02:15.235 --> 01:02:17.351
Control yourself, Higgins.
Give the girl a chance.

01:02:17.435 --> 01:02:20.268
I suppose you can't expect her
to get it right the first time.

01:02:20.355 --> 01:02:22.505
Come here, Eliza, and watch closely.

01:02:26.435 --> 01:02:28.073
Now, you see that flame?

01:02:28.355 --> 01:02:31.711
Every time you pronounce the letter "H"
correctly the flame will waver...

01:02:31.795 --> 01:02:34.946
...and every time you drop your "H"
the flame will remain stationary.

01:02:35.035 --> 01:02:36.673
That's how to know
you've done it correctly.

01:02:36.755 --> 01:02:38.552
In time, your ear will hear the difference.

01:02:38.635 --> 01:02:42.150
You'll see it better in the mirror.
Now listen carefully.

01:02:42.835 --> 01:02:45.633
"In Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire...

01:02:46.075 --> 01:02:48.953
"...hurricanes hardly ever happen."

01:02:50.075 --> 01:02:52.270
Now you repeat that after me.

01:02:52.955 --> 01:02:56.345
"In Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire,
hurricanes hardly ever happen."

01:02:56.435 --> 01:03:01.111
"In 'artford, 'ereford and 'ampshire
'urricanes 'ardly hever 'appen."

01:03:01.235 --> 01:03:02.873
Oh, no, no!

01:03:02.995 --> 01:03:04.713
Have you no ear at all?

01:03:04.835 --> 01:03:06.905
-Should I do it over?
-No, please.

01:03:07.595 --> 01:03:10.109
Start from the very beginning.
Just do this.

01:03:18.995 --> 01:03:20.587
Go on, go on.

01:03:24.315 --> 01:03:26.465
Does the same thing hold true in India?

01:03:26.555 --> 01:03:29.513
Have they the peculiar habit
of not only dropping a letter...

01:03:29.595 --> 01:03:33.474
...but using it where it doesn't belong,
like "hever" instead of "ever"?

01:03:55.875 --> 01:03:56.944
The girl, Higgins!

01:03:57.035 --> 01:03:58.184
Go on. Go on.

01:04:00.075 --> 01:04:02.794
"Poor Professor Higgins

01:04:04.155 --> 01:04:06.908
"Poor Professor Higgins

01:04:08.195 --> 01:04:12.154
"Night and day he slaves away

01:04:12.955 --> 01:04:16.311
"Oh, poor Professor Higgins

01:04:17.795 --> 01:04:21.583
"All day long on his feet

01:04:22.115 --> 01:04:25.903
"Up and down until he's numb

01:04:26.395 --> 01:04:30.149
"Doesn't rest, doesn't eat

01:04:30.635 --> 01:04:33.274
"Doesn't touch a crumb"

01:04:37.235 --> 01:04:38.384
Again, Eliza.

01:04:38.675 --> 01:04:41.428
How kind of you to let me come.

01:04:42.515 --> 01:04:45.234
How kind of you to let me come.

01:04:45.315 --> 01:04:47.749
No. "Kind of you."

01:04:47.915 --> 01:04:50.827
How kind of you to let me come.

01:04:51.355 --> 01:04:54.233
How kind of you to let me come.

01:04:54.315 --> 01:04:56.545
Kind of you. It's like "cup of tea."

01:04:56.635 --> 01:04:59.354
Kind of you. Cup of tea. Say, "cup of tea."

01:04:59.555 --> 01:05:00.544
Cuppatea.

01:05:00.635 --> 01:05:02.830
No. "A cup of tea."

01:05:03.635 --> 01:05:06.866
It's awfully good cake.
I wonder where Mrs. Pearce gets it.

01:05:07.235 --> 01:05:11.672
First rate. And those strawberry tarts
are delicious. Did you try the pline cake?

01:05:17.115 --> 01:05:18.343
Try it again.

01:05:18.475 --> 01:05:20.306
-Did you try the--
-Pickering!

01:05:21.835 --> 01:05:23.063
Again, Eliza.

01:05:23.195 --> 01:05:24.389
Cuppatea.

01:05:24.475 --> 01:05:25.464
Oh, no.

01:05:26.035 --> 01:05:27.468
Can't you hear the difference?

01:05:27.555 --> 01:05:32.106
Look, put your tongue forward until
it squeezes on the top of your lower teeth.

01:05:32.635 --> 01:05:34.705
And then say "cup."

01:05:36.155 --> 01:05:37.349
Then say "of."

01:05:37.755 --> 01:05:40.394
Then say "cup, cup, cup, cup, of, of, of, of."

01:05:43.995 --> 01:05:46.429
By Jove, Higgins, that was a glorious tea.

01:05:46.555 --> 01:05:49.672
You finish the last strawberry tart.
I couldn't eat another thing.

01:05:49.755 --> 01:05:51.586
-I couldn't touch it.
-Shame to waste it.

01:05:51.675 --> 01:05:56.271
Oh, it won't be wasted. I know somebody
who's immensely fond of strawberry tarts.

01:06:06.075 --> 01:06:08.669
"Poor Professor Higgins

01:06:10.115 --> 01:06:12.754
"Poor Professor Higgins

01:06:14.115 --> 01:06:17.949
"On he plods against all odds

01:06:18.915 --> 01:06:22.510
"Oh, poor Professor Higgins

01:06:23.875 --> 01:06:27.390
"Nine p.m., ten p.m.

01:06:28.075 --> 01:06:31.704
"On through midnight every night

01:06:32.355 --> 01:06:36.906
"One a.m., two a.m., three...."

01:06:38.555 --> 01:06:39.544
Four.

01:06:40.955 --> 01:06:41.944
Five.

01:06:42.875 --> 01:06:44.866
Six marbles.

01:06:46.355 --> 01:06:48.869
I want you to read this
and I want you to enunciate...

01:06:48.955 --> 01:06:52.231
...every word just as if the marbles
were not in your mouth.

01:06:53.275 --> 01:06:55.550
"With blackest moss, the flower pots...

01:06:55.915 --> 01:06:58.224
"...were thickly crusted, one and all."

01:06:58.595 --> 01:07:00.347
Each word, clear as a bell.

01:07:01.515 --> 01:07:04.632
"With blackest moss the flower...

01:07:05.355 --> 01:07:06.424
"...pots."

01:07:06.595 --> 01:07:07.789
I can't!

01:07:07.995 --> 01:07:09.110
I can't!

01:07:09.235 --> 01:07:12.113
I say, Higgins, are those pebbles
really necessary?

01:07:12.355 --> 01:07:16.553
If they were necessary for Demosthenes
they are necessary for Eliza Doolittle.

01:07:16.755 --> 01:07:18.029
Go on, Eliza.

01:07:18.435 --> 01:07:22.110
"With the blackest moss the flower pots...

01:07:22.475 --> 01:07:25.433
"...were thickly crusted one and--"

01:07:25.795 --> 01:07:28.434
I can't understand a word, not a word.

01:07:28.595 --> 01:07:31.189
"With blackest moss, the flower pots...

01:07:31.555 --> 01:07:34.115
"...were thickly crusted, one and all."

01:07:34.395 --> 01:07:36.909
Perhaps the poem is
a little too difficult for the girl.

01:07:36.995 --> 01:07:40.351
Why don't you try something simpler,
like The Owl and the Pussycat?

01:07:40.435 --> 01:07:42.471
Yes, that's a charming one.

01:07:42.675 --> 01:07:45.553
Pickering, I can't hear a word
the girl is saying!

01:07:49.555 --> 01:07:50.954
What's the matter?

01:07:51.915 --> 01:07:53.143
I swallowed one.

01:07:53.235 --> 01:07:57.114
It doesn't matter. I've got plenty more.
Open your mouth. One, two....

01:07:59.475 --> 01:08:02.035
"Quit, Professor Higgins

01:08:03.235 --> 01:08:05.874
"Quit, Professor Higgins

01:08:07.275 --> 01:08:11.473
"Hear our plea, or payday we will quit

01:08:12.475 --> 01:08:14.147
"Professor Higgins!

"'Ay' not 'I', 'O' not 'ow'

"Pounding, pounding in our brain

"'Ay' not 'I', 'O' not 'ow'

01:08:28.274 --> 01:08:30.913
"Don't say 'rine' say 'rain"'

01:08:34.675 --> 01:08:37.109
"The rain in Spain...

01:08:37.475 --> 01:08:41.309
"...stays mainly in the plain."

01:08:41.715 --> 01:08:43.228
I can't!

01:08:43.635 --> 01:08:45.307
I'm so tired!

01:08:45.395 --> 01:08:47.783
I'm so tired.

01:08:48.154 --> 01:08:51.545
For God's sake, Higgins,
it must be 3:00 in the morning.

01:08:51.635 --> 01:08:52.953
Do be reasonable.

01:08:53.715 --> 01:08:55.785
I am always reasonable.

01:08:57.715 --> 01:09:02.106
Eliza, if I can go on
with a blistering headache, you can.

01:09:03.354 --> 01:09:05.152
I got a 'eadache, too.

01:09:08.515 --> 01:09:11.551
I know your head aches.
I know you're tired.

01:09:12.115 --> 01:09:15.630
I know your nerves are as raw
as meat in a butcher's window.

01:09:18.274 --> 01:09:20.993
But think what you're trying to accomplish.

01:09:21.915 --> 01:09:24.475
Just think what you're dealing with.

01:09:26.035 --> 01:09:29.107
The majesty and grandeur
of the English language....

01:09:29.194 --> 01:09:31.662
It's the greatest possession we have.

01:09:32.435 --> 01:09:35.666
The noblest thoughts that ever flowed
through the hearts of men...

01:09:35.755 --> 01:09:39.350
...are contained in its extraordinary,
imaginative...

01:09:39.715 --> 01:09:41.944
...and musical mixtures of sounds.

01:09:43.395 --> 01:09:46.591
And that's what you've set yourself
out to conquer, Eliza.

01:09:48.234 --> 01:09:51.068
And conquer it you will.

01:10:15.955 --> 01:10:17.627
Now try it again.

01:10:21.075 --> 01:10:24.226
"The rain in Spain...

01:10:24.915 --> 01:10:28.669
"...stays mainly in the plain."

01:10:30.835 --> 01:10:32.029
What was that?

01:10:37.955 --> 01:10:41.072
"The rain in Spain...

01:10:41.275 --> 01:10:44.870
"...stays mainly in the plain."

01:10:51.075 --> 01:10:52.144
Again.

01:10:53.795 --> 01:10:58.266
"The rain in Spain
stays mainly in the plain."

01:10:59.315 --> 01:11:02.148
I think she's got it.

01:11:02.555 --> 01:11:06.753
"The rain in Spain
Stays mainly in the plain

01:11:07.155 --> 01:11:09.874
"By George, she's got it
By George, she's got it

01:11:10.275 --> 01:11:12.835
"Now once again
Where does it rain?

01:11:13.515 --> 01:11:16.188
"On the plain, on the plain

01:11:16.595 --> 01:11:18.950
"And where's that soggy plain?

01:11:19.555 --> 01:11:22.308
"In Spain, in Spain

"The rain in Spain

"The rain in Spain

"In Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire

"Hurricanes hardly happen

"How kind of you to let me come

01:11:46.875 --> 01:11:49.435
"Now once again

01:11:49.995 --> 01:11:52.384
"On the plain, on the plain

01:11:53.035 --> 01:11:55.549
"And where's that blasted plain?

01:11:56.035 --> 01:11:58.629
"In Spain, in Spain

"The rain in Spain
Stays mainly in the plain"

01:12:53.795 --> 01:12:58.107
We're making fine progress, Pickering.
I think the time has come to try her out.

01:12:58.675 --> 01:13:00.313
Are you feeling all right, Mr. Higgins?

01:13:00.395 --> 01:13:01.908
Yes, I'm feeling fine. How are you?

01:13:01.995 --> 01:13:03.314
-Very well, thank you.
-Good.

01:13:03.395 --> 01:13:05.989
Let's test her in public
and see how she fares.

01:13:06.115 --> 01:13:09.630
Mr. Higgins, I was awakened
by a dreadful pounding.

01:13:09.715 --> 01:13:11.228
Do you know what it might have been?

01:13:11.315 --> 01:13:13.954
I didn't hear any pounding.
Did you, Pickering?

01:13:14.475 --> 01:13:16.784
If this goes on, you'd better see a doctor.

01:13:16.875 --> 01:13:19.594
-I know. We'll take her to the races.
-The races?

01:13:19.675 --> 01:13:21.347
My mother's box at Ascot.

01:13:21.515 --> 01:13:24.905
-You'll consult your mother first, of course.
-Yes, of course.

01:13:26.955 --> 01:13:30.072
No, I think we'd better surprise her.
Now let's go to bed.

01:13:30.155 --> 01:13:32.908
First thing in the morning,
we'll go and buy her a dress.

01:13:32.995 --> 01:13:34.553
Now get on with your work, Eliza.

01:13:34.635 --> 01:13:36.591
But, Mr. Higgins, it's early in the morning.

01:13:36.675 --> 01:13:39.553
What better time to work
than early in the morning?

01:13:39.875 --> 01:13:41.752
Where does one buy a lady's gown?

01:13:41.835 --> 01:13:43.063
Whitely's, of course.

01:13:43.155 --> 01:13:44.190
How do you know that?

01:13:44.275 --> 01:13:45.628
Common knowledge.

01:13:45.835 --> 01:13:47.553
Let's not buy her anything too flowery.

01:13:47.635 --> 01:13:51.753
I despise those gowns with weeds here
and weeds there.

01:13:52.155 --> 01:13:54.544
We'll buy something simple and modest...

01:13:54.635 --> 01:13:56.830
...and elegant. That's what's called for.

01:13:56.915 --> 01:13:58.985
Perhaps with a bow.

01:14:00.355 --> 01:14:01.993
Yes. That's just right.

01:14:04.835 --> 01:14:08.430
You've all been working too hard.
I think the strain is beginning to show.

01:14:08.515 --> 01:14:10.710
Eliza, I don't care what Mr. Higgins says.

01:14:10.795 --> 01:14:13.263
You must put down your books
and go to bed.

01:14:13.355 --> 01:14:16.188
"Bed! Bed! I couldn't go to bed

01:14:16.355 --> 01:14:19.711
"My head's too light to try to set it down

01:14:22.915 --> 01:14:25.668
"Sleep! Sleep! I couldn't sleep tonight

01:14:25.995 --> 01:14:29.954
"Not for all the jewels in the crown!

01:14:31.715 --> 01:14:34.593
"I could have danced all night

01:14:34.875 --> 01:14:37.753
"I could have danced all night

01:14:38.115 --> 01:14:42.586
"And still have begged for more

01:14:43.955 --> 01:14:46.788
"I could have spread my wings

01:14:47.115 --> 01:14:49.868
"And done a thousand things

01:14:50.275 --> 01:14:54.427
"I've never done before

01:14:56.195 --> 01:15:00.666
"I'll never know what made it so exciting

01:15:02.595 --> 01:15:06.952
"Why all at once my heart took flight

01:15:08.515 --> 01:15:13.305
"I only know when he

01:15:14.155 --> 01:15:17.033
"Began to dance with me

01:15:17.155 --> 01:15:21.467
"I could have danced, danced, danced...

01:15:21.835 --> 01:15:24.554
"...all night! "

01:15:37.235 --> 01:15:38.793
It's after three now.

01:15:39.115 --> 01:15:41.151
Don't you agree now?

01:15:41.515 --> 01:15:44.234
She ought to be in bed!

01:15:46.075 --> 01:15:48.987
"I could have danced all night

01:15:49.355 --> 01:15:52.552
"I could have danced all night

01:15:52.635 --> 01:15:56.992
"And still have begged for more

01:15:58.635 --> 01:16:01.468
"I could have spread my wings

01:16:01.755 --> 01:16:04.553
"And done a thousand things

01:16:05.035 --> 01:16:09.392
"I've never done before

01:16:11.075 --> 01:16:15.910
"I'll never know what made it so exciting

01:16:17.635 --> 01:16:22.106
"Why all at once my heart took flight

01:16:23.755 --> 01:16:28.510
"I only know when he

01:16:29.155 --> 01:16:32.033
"Began to dance with me

01:16:32.395 --> 01:16:36.547
"I could have danced, danced, danced...

01:16:37.635 --> 01:16:40.672
"...all night! "

01:16:42.115 --> 01:16:43.946
It's all been grand, dear.

01:16:44.275 --> 01:16:47.153
But now it's time to sleep!

01:16:54.115 --> 01:16:57.312
"I could have danced all night

01:16:57.635 --> 01:17:00.274
"I could have danced all night

01:17:00.675 --> 01:17:05.146
"And still have begged for more

01:17:07.075 --> 01:17:10.112
"I could have spread my wings

"Why all at once my heart took flight

"I could have danced, danced, danced...

"...all night! "

01:18:29.155 --> 01:18:32.989
"Every duke and earl and peer is here

01:18:33.075 --> 01:18:36.590
"Everyone who should be here is here

01:18:36.715 --> 01:18:39.593
"What a smashing, positively dashing

01:18:39.995 --> 01:18:43.465
"Spectacle, the Ascot opening day

01:18:44.315 --> 01:18:47.387
"At the gate are all the horses

01:18:47.555 --> 01:18:51.389
"Waiting for the cue to fly away

01:18:51.915 --> 01:18:54.873
"What a gripping, absolutely ripping

"Moment at the Ascot opening day

"Pulses rushing

"Faces flushing

"Heartbeats speed up

"I have never been so keyed up!

"Any second now

"They'll begin to run

"Hark! A bell is ringing

"They are springing forward. Look!

01:19:23.235 --> 01:19:25.669
"It has begun

01:19:50.595 --> 01:19:54.429
"What a frenzied moment that was

01:19:54.555 --> 01:19:58.264
"Didn't they maintain an exhausting pace?

01:19:58.955 --> 01:20:02.106
"It was a thrilling, absolutely chilling

01:20:02.275 --> 01:20:05.870
"Running of the Ascot opening race! "

01:21:30.915 --> 01:21:32.030
Mother!

01:21:33.835 --> 01:21:35.826
Henry! What a disagreeable surprise.

01:21:35.915 --> 01:21:37.109
Hello, Mother.

01:21:37.595 --> 01:21:38.664
How nice you look.

01:21:38.755 --> 01:21:41.986
What are you doing here? You promised
never to come to Ascot. Go home.

01:21:42.075 --> 01:21:43.554
I can't. I'm here on business.

01:21:43.635 --> 01:21:46.354
You must. I'm quite serious.
You'll offend all my friends.

01:21:46.435 --> 01:21:48.790
The moment they meet you
I never see them again.

01:21:48.875 --> 01:21:50.593
Besides, you aren't dressed for Ascot.

01:21:50.675 --> 01:21:53.109
I changed my shirt.
Mother, I've got a job for you.

01:21:53.195 --> 01:21:55.584
A phonetics job. I've picked up a girl.

01:21:56.195 --> 01:21:58.390
Not a love affair. She's a flower girl.

01:21:58.475 --> 01:22:01.785
I'm taking her to the annual Embassy Ball
but I wanted to try her out first.

01:22:01.875 --> 01:22:04.833
-I beg your pardon?
-Well, you know the Embassy Ball.

01:22:05.355 --> 01:22:08.108
So I invited her to your box today,
do you understand?

01:22:08.195 --> 01:22:09.594
Common flower girl?

01:22:09.755 --> 01:22:11.632
I taught her how to speak properly.

01:22:11.715 --> 01:22:13.910
She has strict instructions
as to her behavior.

01:22:13.995 --> 01:22:17.271
She's to keep to two subjects:
the weather and everybody's health.

01:22:17.355 --> 01:22:20.392
"Fine day! " and "How do you do?"
Not let herself go on.

01:22:20.475 --> 01:22:22.431
Help her along. You'll be quite safe.

01:22:22.515 --> 01:22:24.631
Safe? To talk about one's health
in the middle of a race?

01:22:24.715 --> 01:22:26.671
She's got to talk about something.

01:22:26.755 --> 01:22:27.904
Where is the girl now?

01:22:27.995 --> 01:22:31.146
She's being pinned. Some of the clothes
we bought her didn't fit.

01:22:31.235 --> 01:22:34.033
I told Pickering we should have
taken her with us.

01:22:36.635 --> 01:22:39.672
-Mrs. Eynsford-Hill.
-Good afternoon, Mrs. Higgins.

01:22:40.675 --> 01:22:42.267
You know my son, Henry.

01:22:42.355 --> 01:22:43.549
How do you do?

01:22:44.115 --> 01:22:46.390
-I've seen you somewhere before.
-I don't know.

01:22:46.475 --> 01:22:48.864
It doesn't matter. You better sit down.

01:22:52.275 --> 01:22:54.106
Where the devil can they be?

01:23:27.635 --> 01:23:29.751
Colonel Pickering,
you're just in time for tea.

01:23:29.835 --> 01:23:32.986
Thank you, Mrs. Higgins.
May I introduce Miss Eliza Doolittle?

01:23:33.075 --> 01:23:34.349
My dear Miss Doolittle.

01:23:34.435 --> 01:23:37.029
How kind of you to let me come.

01:23:37.115 --> 01:23:38.548
Delighted, my dear.

01:23:39.475 --> 01:23:41.386
-Lady Boxington.
-How do you do?

01:23:43.395 --> 01:23:45.192
-Lord Boxington.
-How do you do?

01:23:45.275 --> 01:23:46.151
How do you do?

01:23:46.235 --> 01:23:49.033
-Mrs. Eynsford-Hill, Miss Doolittle.
-How do you do?

01:23:49.115 --> 01:23:50.548
How do you do?

01:23:50.795 --> 01:23:52.592
And Freddy Eynsford-Hill.

01:23:53.715 --> 01:23:55.194
How do you do?

01:23:57.435 --> 01:23:58.948
How do you do?

01:23:59.675 --> 01:24:00.903
Miss Doolittle.

01:24:01.155 --> 01:24:04.192
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins.

01:24:13.035 --> 01:24:15.629
The first race was very exciting,
Miss Doolittle.

01:24:15.715 --> 01:24:17.865
I'm so sorry that you missed it.

01:24:18.075 --> 01:24:19.827
Will it rain, do you think?

01:24:20.115 --> 01:24:24.028
"The rain in Spain stays mainly
in the plain."

01:24:28.955 --> 01:24:33.267
"But in Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire,
hurricanes hardly ever happen."

01:24:34.595 --> 01:24:35.994
How awfully funny.

01:24:36.155 --> 01:24:39.465
What is wrong with that, young man?
I bet I got it right.

01:24:39.755 --> 01:24:40.790
Smashing.

01:24:41.075 --> 01:24:43.430
Has it suddenly turned chilly?

01:24:43.915 --> 01:24:47.146
I do hope we won't have
any unseasonable cold spells.

01:24:47.395 --> 01:24:49.306
They bring on so much influenza.

01:24:49.395 --> 01:24:52.034
And the whole of our family
is susceptible to it.

01:24:52.115 --> 01:24:56.267
My aunt died of influenza, so they said.

01:24:56.795 --> 01:25:00.424
But it's my belief they done
the old woman in.

01:25:01.595 --> 01:25:02.823
Done her in?

01:25:03.435 --> 01:25:05.073
Yes, Lord love you.

01:25:05.315 --> 01:25:07.465
Why should she die of influenza...

01:25:07.715 --> 01:25:11.344
...when she'd come through diphtheria
right enough the year before.

01:25:11.595 --> 01:25:13.711
Fairly blue with it she was.

01:25:14.355 --> 01:25:16.152
They all thought she was dead.

01:25:16.235 --> 01:25:20.194
But my father, he kept ladling gin
down her throat.

01:25:24.955 --> 01:25:29.153
Then she come to so sudden
she bit the bowl off the spoon.

01:25:30.395 --> 01:25:31.794
Dear me!

01:25:32.915 --> 01:25:36.112
Now what call would a woman
with that strength in her...

01:25:36.195 --> 01:25:38.026
...have to die of influenza?

01:25:38.715 --> 01:25:42.833
And what become of her new straw hat
that should have come to me?

01:25:45.315 --> 01:25:47.545
Somebody pinched it.

01:25:48.755 --> 01:25:50.473
And what I say is:

01:25:50.675 --> 01:25:53.508
Them 'as pinched it, done her in.

01:25:54.715 --> 01:25:57.149
Done her in? "Done her in," did you say?

01:25:57.835 --> 01:25:59.427
Whatever does it mean?

01:25:59.555 --> 01:26:03.946
That's the new small talk.
"To do somebody in" means to kill them.

01:26:04.595 --> 01:26:07.553
But you surely don't believe
your aunt was killed?

01:26:08.115 --> 01:26:09.343
Do I not?

01:26:09.475 --> 01:26:14.265
Them she lived with would have killed her
for a hatpin, let alone a hat.

01:26:14.675 --> 01:26:16.984
But it can't have been right
for your father...

01:26:17.075 --> 01:26:19.794
...to pour spirits down her throat like that.

01:26:20.155 --> 01:26:21.747
It might have killed her.

01:26:21.835 --> 01:26:25.464
Not her. Gin was mother's milk to her.

01:26:25.835 --> 01:26:30.750
Besides, he poured so much down
his own throat he knew the good of it.

01:26:31.475 --> 01:26:33.147
Do you mean that he drank?

01:26:33.235 --> 01:26:35.954
Drank? My word. Something chronic.

01:26:39.635 --> 01:26:42.593
Here, what are you sniggering at?

01:26:43.235 --> 01:26:46.227
The new small talk.
You do it so awfully well.

01:26:46.435 --> 01:26:49.950
Well, if I was doing it proper,
what was you sniggering at?

01:26:50.875 --> 01:26:53.070
Have I said anything I oughtn't?

01:26:54.915 --> 01:26:56.428
Not at all, my dear.

01:26:56.635 --> 01:26:58.512
Well, that's a mercy anyhow.

01:27:01.395 --> 01:27:04.785
I don't know if there's time
before the next race to place a bet...

01:27:04.875 --> 01:27:06.627
...but come, my dear.

01:27:06.995 --> 01:27:10.510
I have a bet on number seven.
I should be so happy if you would take it.

01:27:10.595 --> 01:27:12.631
You'll enjoy the race ever so much more.

01:27:12.715 --> 01:27:14.273
That's very kind of you.

01:27:14.355 --> 01:27:15.424
His name is Dover.

01:27:15.515 --> 01:27:16.914
Come along.

01:27:20.235 --> 01:27:22.066
"There they are again

01:27:22.155 --> 01:27:23.713
"Lining up to run

01:27:24.155 --> 01:27:25.793
"Now they're holding steady

01:27:25.875 --> 01:27:28.070
"They are ready for it. Look!

01:27:29.075 --> 01:27:31.225
"It has begun"

01:27:36.915 --> 01:27:38.633
Come on. Come on, Dover.

01:27:39.555 --> 01:27:40.510
Come on.

01:27:40.795 --> 01:27:42.353
Come on, Dover!

01:27:42.475 --> 01:27:43.464
Come on!

01:27:47.635 --> 01:27:51.628
Come on, Dover!
Move your bloomin' arse!

01:27:57.875 --> 01:27:59.194
Oh, my dear.

01:28:13.555 --> 01:28:17.264
You're not serious, Henry. You don't
expect to take her to the Embassy Ball.

01:28:17.355 --> 01:28:18.834
Don't you think she's ready for it?

01:28:18.915 --> 01:28:21.190
Dear Henry, she's ready for a canal barge.

01:28:21.275 --> 01:28:23.425
Her language may need
a little refining, but--

01:28:23.515 --> 01:28:26.985
Really, Henry, if you cannot see
how impossible this whole project is...

01:28:27.075 --> 01:28:28.667
...then you must be potty about her.

01:28:28.755 --> 01:28:30.746
I advise you to give up
and not put yourself...

01:28:30.835 --> 01:28:32.348
...or this poor girl through any more.

01:28:32.435 --> 01:28:34.869
It's the most fascinating venture
I've ever undertaken.

01:28:34.955 --> 01:28:38.265
Pickering and I are at it from morning
till night. It fills our whole lives.

01:28:38.355 --> 01:28:42.064
Teaching Eliza, talking to Eliza,
listening to Eliza, dressing Eliza.

01:28:43.195 --> 01:28:46.585
You're a pretty pair of babies
playing with your live doll.

01:28:46.675 --> 01:28:47.903
Here's the car.

01:30:05.795 --> 01:30:06.784
Good evening, sir.

01:30:06.875 --> 01:30:09.435
-Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
-Immediately, sir.

01:30:09.515 --> 01:30:11.506
Good evening, Professor Higgins.

01:30:28.395 --> 01:30:32.434
"When she mentioned
how her aunt bit off the spoon

01:30:33.155 --> 01:30:36.306
"She completely done me in

01:30:36.795 --> 01:30:40.026
"And my heart went on
a journey to the moon

01:30:40.595 --> 01:30:45.032
"When she told about her father
and the gin

01:30:45.675 --> 01:30:49.509
"And I never saw a more enchanting farce

01:30:50.195 --> 01:30:54.950
"Than the moment when she shouted
'Move your bloomin'--"'

01:30:55.635 --> 01:30:57.591
-Yes, sir?
-Is Miss Doolittle in?

01:30:57.675 --> 01:30:59.427
Whom shall I say is calling?

01:30:59.515 --> 01:31:02.666
Freddy Eynsford-Hill.
If she doesn't remember who I am...

01:31:02.795 --> 01:31:05.593
...tell her I'm the chap
who was "sniggering" at her.

01:31:05.675 --> 01:31:06.630
Yes, sir.

01:31:06.715 --> 01:31:08.546
And will you give her these?

01:31:08.995 --> 01:31:10.144
Wouldn't you like to come in?

01:31:10.235 --> 01:31:12.271
They're having dinner,
but you may wait in the hall.

01:31:12.355 --> 01:31:15.745
No, thank you. I want to drink in
the street where she lives.

01:31:23.755 --> 01:31:28.510
"I have often walked
down this street before

01:31:29.315 --> 01:31:33.991
"But the pavement always stayed
beneath my feet before

01:31:34.715 --> 01:31:39.470
"All at once am I several stories high

01:31:40.115 --> 01:31:44.552
"Knowing I'm on the street where you live

01:31:45.795 --> 01:31:50.550
"Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?

01:31:51.235 --> 01:31:55.990
"Can you hear a lark
in any other part of town?

01:31:56.875 --> 01:32:01.505
"Does enchantment pour
out of every door?

01:32:02.275 --> 01:32:06.746
"No, it's just on the street where you live

01:32:08.235 --> 01:32:12.547
"And, oh, the towering feeling

01:32:13.355 --> 01:32:17.667
"Just to know somehow you are near

01:32:19.355 --> 01:32:23.667
"The overpowering feeling

01:32:24.195 --> 01:32:28.666
"That any second you may suddenly appear

01:32:30.155 --> 01:32:34.751
"People stop and stare,
they don't bother me

01:32:35.715 --> 01:32:40.186
"For there's nowhere else on earth
that I would rather be

01:32:41.435 --> 01:32:44.313
"Let the time go by

01:32:44.435 --> 01:32:48.269
"I won't care if I

01:32:48.995 --> 01:32:53.466
"Can be here on the street where you live"

01:33:00.515 --> 01:33:02.346
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

01:33:02.475 --> 01:33:05.467
Miss Doolittle says she doesn't want
to see anyone ever again.

01:33:05.555 --> 01:33:07.193
But why? She was unbelievable.

01:33:07.275 --> 01:33:10.312
So I've been told, sir.
Is there any further message?

01:33:11.435 --> 01:33:12.629
Tell her that I'll wait.

01:33:12.715 --> 01:33:15.024
But it might be days, sir, even weeks.

01:33:15.115 --> 01:33:17.549
But don't you see? I'll be happier here.

01:33:26.115 --> 01:33:30.586
"People stop and stare,
they don't bother me

01:33:31.875 --> 01:33:36.346
"For there's nowhere else on earth
that I would rather be

01:33:37.475 --> 01:33:40.228
"Let the time go by

01:33:40.875 --> 01:33:45.027
"I won't care if I

01:33:45.955 --> 01:33:50.426
"Can be here on the street where you live"

01:34:00.195 --> 01:34:02.709
It really is, Higgins.
It's inhuman to continue.

01:34:02.795 --> 01:34:05.707
Do you realize what you've got to teach
this girl in six weeks?

01:34:05.795 --> 01:34:08.628
You've got to teach her to walk, talk,
address a duke, a lord...

01:34:08.715 --> 01:34:11.309
...a bishop, an ambassador.
It's absolutely impossible.

01:34:11.395 --> 01:34:14.785
Higgins, I'm trying to tell you
that I want to call off the bet.

01:34:14.875 --> 01:34:17.025
I know you're a stubborn man, but so am I.

01:34:17.115 --> 01:34:18.946
This experiment is over.

01:34:19.035 --> 01:34:23.187
And nothing short of an order
from the king could force me to recant.

01:34:25.115 --> 01:34:27.390
You understand, Higgins? It's over.

01:34:29.075 --> 01:34:31.748
Higgins, if there's any mishap
at the Embassy tonight...

01:34:31.835 --> 01:34:34.349
...if Miss Doolittle suffers
any embarrassment...

01:34:34.435 --> 01:34:35.629
...it'll be on your head alone.

01:34:35.715 --> 01:34:36.909
Eliza can do anything.

01:34:36.995 --> 01:34:38.713
Suppose she's discovered?
Remember Ascot.

01:34:38.795 --> 01:34:40.592
Suppose she makes
another ghastly mistake?

01:34:40.675 --> 01:34:43.235
There'll be no horses at the ball, Pickering.

01:34:45.195 --> 01:34:47.390
Think of how agonizing it would be.

01:34:47.475 --> 01:34:50.035
If anything happened tonight,
I don't know what I'd do.

01:34:50.115 --> 01:34:51.628
You could always rejoin your regiment.

01:34:51.715 --> 01:34:53.467
This is no time for flippancy, Higgins.

01:34:53.555 --> 01:34:55.511
The way you've driven her
the last six weeks...

01:34:55.595 --> 01:34:57.586
...has exceeded all bounds
of common decency.

01:34:57.675 --> 01:35:00.553
For God's sake, stop pacing.
Can't you settle somewhere?

01:35:00.635 --> 01:35:02.512
Have some port. It'll quieten your nerves.

01:35:02.595 --> 01:35:03.869
I'm not nervous.

01:35:05.435 --> 01:35:07.266
-Where is it?
-On the piano.

01:35:08.755 --> 01:35:10.029
The car's here, sir.

01:35:10.115 --> 01:35:11.707
Good. Tell Miss Doolittle.

01:35:11.795 --> 01:35:15.265
Tell Miss Doolittle indeed.
I'll bet you that damned gown doesn't fit.

01:35:15.355 --> 01:35:17.346
I warned you about these French designers.

01:35:17.435 --> 01:35:20.632
We should've gone to an English shop.
They would've been on our side.

01:35:20.715 --> 01:35:22.945
-Have a glass of port?
-No, thank you.

01:35:29.035 --> 01:35:33.074
Are you so sure this girl will retain
everything you've hammered into her?

01:35:33.635 --> 01:35:35.227
Well, we shall see.

01:35:35.555 --> 01:35:37.034
Suppose she doesn't?

01:35:38.235 --> 01:35:39.714
I lose my bet.

01:35:39.875 --> 01:35:43.390
There's one thing I can't stand about you,
your confounded complacency.

01:35:43.475 --> 01:35:45.431
At a moment like this,
with so much at stake...

01:35:45.515 --> 01:35:48.871
...it's utterly indecent
that you don't need a glass of port.

01:35:50.475 --> 01:35:54.070
And what about the girl? You act
as though she doesn't matter at all.

01:35:54.155 --> 01:35:56.669
Rubbish, Pickering. Of course she matters.

01:35:57.035 --> 01:35:59.344
What do you think I've been doing
all these months?

01:35:59.435 --> 01:36:02.791
What could possibly matter more
than to take a human being...

01:36:02.875 --> 01:36:06.914
...and change her into a different human
being by creating a new speech for her?

01:36:06.995 --> 01:36:10.590
It's filling up the deepest gap
that separates class from class...

01:36:10.755 --> 01:36:12.268
...and soul from soul.

01:36:12.675 --> 01:36:15.235
Oh, she matters immensely.

01:36:36.435 --> 01:36:38.824
Miss Doolittle, you look beautiful.

01:36:39.475 --> 01:36:40.988
Thank you, Colonel Pickering.

01:36:41.075 --> 01:36:42.906
Don't you think so, Higgins?

01:36:45.515 --> 01:36:48.075
Not bad. Not bad at all.

01:39:41.354 --> 01:39:43.709
Maestro! Maestro!

01:39:45.874 --> 01:39:46.989
Don't you remember me?

01:39:47.074 --> 01:39:48.632
No. Who the devil are you?

01:39:48.714 --> 01:39:52.024
I'm your pupil. Your first, your greatest,
your best pupil.

01:39:52.154 --> 01:39:54.543
I'm Zoltan Karpathy, that marvelous boy.

01:39:55.674 --> 01:39:57.551
I made your name famous
throughout Europe.

01:39:57.634 --> 01:39:59.465
You teach me phonetics.
You can't forget me.

01:39:59.554 --> 01:40:01.226
Why don't you have your hair cut?

01:40:01.314 --> 01:40:04.704
I don't have your imposing appearance,
your figure, your brow.

01:40:04.834 --> 01:40:06.790
If I had my hair cut,
nobody would notice me.

01:40:06.874 --> 01:40:08.626
Where did you get these old coins?

01:40:08.714 --> 01:40:10.625
These are decorations for languages.

01:40:10.714 --> 01:40:12.386
The Queen of Transylvania is here.

01:40:12.474 --> 01:40:15.466
I'm indispensable to her
at these official international parties.

01:40:15.554 --> 01:40:18.352
I speak 32 languages.
I know everyone in Europe.

01:40:18.434 --> 01:40:20.425
No imposter can escape my detection.

01:40:20.514 --> 01:40:22.425
Professor Karpathy.

01:40:24.514 --> 01:40:25.993
The Greek ambassador.

01:40:26.754 --> 01:40:27.789
Greek, my foot!

01:40:27.874 --> 01:40:30.547
He pretends not to know English,
but he can't deceive me.

01:40:30.634 --> 01:40:32.943
He's the son of a Yorkshire watchmaker.

01:40:33.634 --> 01:40:36.910
He speaks English so villainously
that he cannot utter a word...

01:40:36.994 --> 01:40:39.144
...without betraying his origin.

01:40:39.234 --> 01:40:42.829
I help him pretend, but make him pay
through the nose. I make them all pay.

01:40:42.914 --> 01:40:46.065
Excuse me, sir, you are wanted upstairs.
Her Excellency asked for you.

01:41:04.994 --> 01:41:06.905
Viscount and Viscountess Saxon.

01:41:10.154 --> 01:41:12.907
Baron and Baroness of Yorkshire.

01:41:14.554 --> 01:41:17.273
Sir Guy and Lady Scot-Auckland.

01:41:36.314 --> 01:41:38.384
The Count and Countess Demereau.

01:41:39.074 --> 01:41:41.463
The Viscount and Viscountess Hillyard.

01:41:41.634 --> 01:41:44.387
Mr. and Mrs. Richard Lanser.

01:41:44.994 --> 01:41:47.508
Lord and Lady Clanders.

01:41:48.154 --> 01:41:50.907
Miss Eliza Doolittle, Colonel Pickering.

01:41:51.234 --> 01:41:54.670
Miss Eliza Doolittle. Colonel Pickering.

01:41:55.074 --> 01:41:56.985
Professor Higgins.

01:41:57.474 --> 01:41:59.465
-Your Excellency.
-Miss Doolittle.

01:41:59.554 --> 01:42:00.782
How do you do?

01:42:00.874 --> 01:42:03.069
-Good evening, Colonel.
-Good evening.

01:42:04.434 --> 01:42:07.631
What an enchanting young lady
you have with you this evening.

01:42:07.714 --> 01:42:09.067
Well, who is she?

01:42:09.434 --> 01:42:12.983
Oh, a cousin of mine. And Higgins.
Excuse me.

01:42:13.314 --> 01:42:14.588
Professor Higgins.

01:42:14.674 --> 01:42:18.587
Such a faraway look,
as if she's always lived in a garden.

01:42:18.914 --> 01:42:20.984
So she has. A sort of garden.

01:42:48.674 --> 01:42:51.984
Henry must take Eliza home at once.
There's a language expert here.

01:42:52.074 --> 01:42:55.111
-Sort of, you know, "imposterologist."
-I beg you pardon?

01:42:55.834 --> 01:42:58.268
The young lady with Colonel Pickering....

01:42:58.394 --> 01:42:59.907
Find out who she is.

01:43:00.154 --> 01:43:01.348
With pleasure.

01:43:01.794 --> 01:43:04.183
The whole situation is highly explosive.

01:43:09.754 --> 01:43:12.222
Tell me, Zoltan,
some more about the Greek ambassador.

01:43:12.314 --> 01:43:15.750
Gladly, but first I would love you
to present me to this glorious creature.

01:43:15.834 --> 01:43:17.950
Does he really come from Yorkshire?

01:43:26.434 --> 01:43:29.153
Her Majesty, the Queen of Transylvania...

01:43:29.434 --> 01:43:32.471
...and His Royal Highness Prince Gregor.

01:44:16.674 --> 01:44:19.063
Charming. Quite charming.

01:44:20.354 --> 01:44:22.072
Miss Doolittle, Madam.

01:45:54.234 --> 01:45:57.146
Miss Doolittle, my son would like
to dance with you.

01:48:56.154 --> 01:48:57.906
Absolutely fantastic.

01:49:01.234 --> 01:49:02.633
A lot of tomfoolery.

01:49:02.714 --> 01:49:04.670
It was an immense achievement.

01:49:04.754 --> 01:49:06.153
Well, Mr. Higgins?

01:49:06.594 --> 01:49:09.586
A triumph, Mrs. Pearce. A total triumph.

01:49:09.874 --> 01:49:13.184
Higgins, you were superb,
absolutely superb.

01:49:13.394 --> 01:49:17.182
Tell us the truth now, weren't you
a little bit nervous once or twice?

01:49:17.314 --> 01:49:18.986
Not during the whole evening?

01:49:19.074 --> 01:49:20.666
Not when I saw we were going to win.

01:49:20.754 --> 01:49:22.665
I felt like a bear in a cage hanging about.

01:49:22.754 --> 01:49:24.346
It was an immense achievement.

01:49:24.434 --> 01:49:27.392
If I hadn't backed myself to do it,
I'd have given up two months ago.

01:49:27.474 --> 01:49:28.748
Absolutely fantastic.

01:49:28.834 --> 01:49:30.313
Yes, a lot of tomfoolery.

01:49:30.394 --> 01:49:32.271
Higgins, I salute you.

01:49:32.354 --> 01:49:34.993
The silly people don't know
their own silly business.

01:49:35.074 --> 01:49:37.952
"Tonight, old man, you did it
You did it, you did it

01:49:38.114 --> 01:49:40.867
"You said that you would do it
And indeed you did

01:49:40.954 --> 01:49:43.832
"I thought that you would rue it
I doubted you'd do it

01:49:43.914 --> 01:49:46.747
"But now I must admit it
That succeed you did

01:49:46.954 --> 01:49:49.468
"You should get a medal
Or be even made a knight

01:49:49.554 --> 01:49:52.114
"Oh, it was nothing, really nothing

01:49:52.794 --> 01:49:55.433
"All alone you hurdled
Every obstacle in sight

01:49:55.674 --> 01:49:58.711
"Now wait, now wait
Give credit where it's due

01:49:58.834 --> 01:50:01.223
"A lot of the glory goes to you

01:50:01.914 --> 01:50:04.826
"But you're the one who did it
Who did it, who did it

01:50:04.914 --> 01:50:07.712
"As sturdy as Gibraltar
Not a second did you falter

01:50:07.794 --> 01:50:09.022
"There's no doubt about it

01:50:09.114 --> 01:50:12.265
"You did it!

01:50:15.354 --> 01:50:19.313
"I must have aged a year tonight
At times I thought I'd die of fright

01:50:19.554 --> 01:50:22.148
"Never was there a momentary lull

01:50:23.274 --> 01:50:27.108
"Shortly after we came in
I saw at once we'd easily win

01:50:27.234 --> 01:50:29.873
"And after that I found it deadly dull

01:50:31.114 --> 01:50:33.230
"You should have heard
The 'oohs' and 'aahs'

01:50:33.314 --> 01:50:35.225
"Everyone wondering who she was

01:50:35.314 --> 01:50:37.874
"You'd think they'd never seen
a lady before

01:50:38.554 --> 01:50:42.706
"And when the Prince of Transylvania
Asked to meet her

01:50:43.634 --> 01:50:46.990
"And gave his arm to lead her to the floor

01:50:48.474 --> 01:50:51.625
"I said to him: 'You did it
You did it, you did it'

01:50:51.714 --> 01:50:54.751
"They thought she was ecstatic
And so damned aristocratic

01:50:54.834 --> 01:50:57.223
"And they never knew
That you...

01:50:59.154 --> 01:51:00.269
"...did it"

01:51:02.394 --> 01:51:04.191
Thank goodness for Zoltan Karpathy.

01:51:04.274 --> 01:51:06.424
If it hadn't been for him
I would've died of boredom.

01:51:06.514 --> 01:51:08.664
Karpathy? That dreadful Hungarian?
Was he there?

01:51:08.754 --> 01:51:11.712
Yes, he was there all right
and up to his old tricks.

01:51:11.914 --> 01:51:14.269
"That blackguard
Who uses the science of speech

01:51:14.354 --> 01:51:16.788
"More to blackmail and swindle than teach

01:51:17.354 --> 01:51:19.743
"He made it the devilish business of his

01:51:20.034 --> 01:51:22.912
"To find out who this Miss Doolittle is

01:51:23.874 --> 01:51:26.229
"Every time we looked around
There he was

01:51:26.354 --> 01:51:28.424
"That hairy hound from Budapest

01:51:30.354 --> 01:51:33.232
"Never leaving us alone
Never have I ever known

01:51:33.314 --> 01:51:34.542
"A ruder pest

01:51:36.434 --> 01:51:40.507
"Finally I decided it was foolish
Not to let him have his chance with her

01:51:42.474 --> 01:51:46.308
"So I stepped aside
And let him dance with her

01:51:47.994 --> 01:51:52.909
"Oozing charm from every pore
He oiled his way around the floor

01:51:53.234 --> 01:51:57.386
"Every trick that he could play
He used to strip her mask away

01:51:57.834 --> 01:52:01.747
"And when at last the dance was done
He glowed as if he knew he'd won

01:52:02.514 --> 01:52:05.506
"And with a voice too eager
And a smile too broad

01:52:05.994 --> 01:52:09.350
"He announced to the hostess
That she was a fraud"

01:52:10.234 --> 01:52:11.462
No!

01:52:16.714 --> 01:52:20.946
"'Her English is too good,' he said
'That clearly indicates that she is foreign

01:52:22.954 --> 01:52:25.627
"'Whereas others are instructed
In their native language

01:52:25.714 --> 01:52:27.432
"'English people aren't

01:52:29.034 --> 01:52:33.505
"'Although she may have studied with
an expert dialectician and grammarian

01:52:35.594 --> 01:52:40.065
"'I can tell that she was born

01:52:41.434 --> 01:52:42.753
"'Hungarian'

01:52:44.154 --> 01:52:46.509
"Not only Hungarian but of royal blood

01:52:47.594 --> 01:52:49.505
"She is a princess

01:52:49.834 --> 01:52:53.509
"'Her blood,' he said
'ls bluer than the Danube is or ever was

01:52:53.634 --> 01:52:56.467
"'Royalty is absolutely written on her face

01:52:56.554 --> 01:52:59.466
"'She thought I was taken in
But actually I never was

01:52:59.594 --> 01:53:02.472
"'How could she deceive
Another member of her race?

"'I know each language on the map'
Said he

01:53:07.434 --> 01:53:11.552
"'And she's Hungarian
As the first Hungarian Rhapsody"'

01:53:19.234 --> 01:53:22.909
"Congratulations, Professor Higgins

01:53:23.274 --> 01:53:26.630
"For your glorious victory

01:53:26.874 --> 01:53:30.469
"Congratulations, Professor Higgins

01:53:30.874 --> 01:53:34.184
"You'll be mentioned in history"

01:53:55.954 --> 01:53:58.070
Well, thank God, that's over.

01:53:58.594 --> 01:54:01.188
Now I can go to bed
without dreading tomorrow.

01:54:03.514 --> 01:54:05.744
-Good night, Mr. Higgins.
-Good night, Mrs. Pearce.

01:54:05.834 --> 01:54:09.543
I think I'll turn in, too. Good night.
It's been a great occasion.

01:54:09.634 --> 01:54:11.192
Good night, Pickering.

01:54:12.074 --> 01:54:13.348
Mrs. Pearce?

01:54:14.234 --> 01:54:18.273
Damn, I meant to ask her to give me coffee
in the morning instead of tea.

01:54:18.874 --> 01:54:22.549
Leave a little note for her will you, Eliza.
And put out the lights.

01:55:08.354 --> 01:55:10.822
Must be downstairs. Oh, darn it.

01:55:11.194 --> 01:55:12.946
I'll leave my head behind
one of these days.

01:55:13.034 --> 01:55:15.548
What the devil have I done
with my slippers?

01:55:18.154 --> 01:55:19.792
Here are your slippers!

01:55:24.874 --> 01:55:28.503
Take your slippers and may you never
have a day's luck with them.

01:55:29.194 --> 01:55:31.105
What on earth? What's the matter?

01:55:31.194 --> 01:55:32.786
Is anything wrong?

01:55:32.914 --> 01:55:35.747
No, nothing's wrong with you.
I won your bet for you, haven't I?

01:55:35.834 --> 01:55:38.587
That's enough for you!
I don't matter, I suppose?

01:55:39.154 --> 01:55:42.624
You won my bet?
You presumptuous insect! I won it!

01:55:42.714 --> 01:55:44.306
Why did you throw the slippers at me?

01:55:44.394 --> 01:55:47.704
Because I wanted to smash your face.
I could kill you, you selfish brute!

01:55:47.794 --> 01:55:49.864
Why didn't you leave me
where you picked me up?

01:55:49.954 --> 01:55:53.583
You thank God it's all over. Now you can
throw me back again! Do you?

01:55:53.674 --> 01:55:56.142
Oh, so the creature's nervous after all?

01:55:59.274 --> 01:56:01.742
Claws in, you cat!
How dare you show your temper to me?

01:56:01.834 --> 01:56:03.347
Sit down and be quiet!

01:56:03.434 --> 01:56:05.948
What's to become of me?

01:56:08.994 --> 01:56:10.825
How do I know what's to become of you?

01:56:10.914 --> 01:56:12.063
What does it matter?

01:56:12.154 --> 01:56:14.714
You don't care. I know you don't care.

01:56:14.794 --> 01:56:17.183
You wouldn't care if I was dead.
I'm nothing to you.

01:56:17.274 --> 01:56:19.071
Not as much as them slippers.

01:56:19.154 --> 01:56:20.189
Those slippers!

01:56:20.274 --> 01:56:23.789
Those slippers! I didn't think it meant
any difference now.

01:56:27.234 --> 01:56:29.873
Why have you suddenly begun
going on like this?

01:56:30.194 --> 01:56:32.754
May I ask if you complain
of your treatment here?

01:56:32.834 --> 01:56:33.630
No.

01:56:33.754 --> 01:56:36.746
Has anybody behaved badly?
Colonel Pickering, Mrs. Pearce?

01:56:36.834 --> 01:56:37.823
No.

01:56:38.114 --> 01:56:41.072
Well you don't pretend
that I have treated you badly?

01:56:41.834 --> 01:56:42.823
No.

01:56:42.914 --> 01:56:44.745
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

01:56:45.714 --> 01:56:48.467
Perhaps you're tired
after the strain of the day.

01:56:49.114 --> 01:56:51.389
Would you have a chocolate?

01:56:51.714 --> 01:56:54.103
No, thank you.

01:56:56.194 --> 01:57:00.028
Well, it's only natural that you should
be anxious, but it's all over now.

01:57:00.114 --> 01:57:01.911
Nothing more to worry about.

01:57:01.994 --> 01:57:04.747
No, nothing more for you to worry about.

01:57:06.034 --> 01:57:08.628
Oh, God, I wish I was dead.

01:57:09.234 --> 01:57:11.702
Why? In heaven's name, why?

01:57:12.514 --> 01:57:16.109
Now listen to me, Eliza.
All this irritation is purely subjective.

01:57:16.474 --> 01:57:18.624
I don't understand. I'm too ignorant.

01:57:18.714 --> 01:57:22.070
It's just imagination. Nothing's wrong.
Nobody's hurting you.

01:57:22.154 --> 01:57:23.303
Go to bed and sleep it off.

01:57:23.394 --> 01:57:27.672
Have a little cry and say your prayers.
You'll feel very much more comfortable.

01:57:27.994 --> 01:57:29.746
I heard your prayers.

01:57:29.914 --> 01:57:31.586
"Thank God it's all over."

01:57:31.714 --> 01:57:33.352
Don't you thank God it's all over?

01:57:33.434 --> 01:57:35.743
Now you're free,
and you can do what you like.

01:57:35.834 --> 01:57:38.826
Oh, what am I fit for?
What have you left me fit for?

01:57:39.514 --> 01:57:42.153
Where am I to go? What am I to do?

01:57:42.754 --> 01:57:44.745
And what's to become of me?

01:57:45.794 --> 01:57:48.513
That's what's worrying you, is it?

01:57:50.074 --> 01:57:51.951
I wouldn't worry about that if I were you.

01:57:52.034 --> 01:57:56.266
I'm sure you won't have any difficulty
in settling yourself somewhere or other.

01:57:58.914 --> 01:58:01.428
I didn't quite realize you were going away.

01:58:02.434 --> 01:58:04.311
You might marry, you know.

01:58:04.674 --> 01:58:08.428
You see, Eliza, all men are not confirmed
old bachelors like me and the Colonel.

01:58:08.514 --> 01:58:11.392
Most men are the marrying sort,
poor devils.

01:58:12.114 --> 01:58:13.069
You're not bad-looking.

01:58:13.154 --> 01:58:15.543
You're really quite a pleasure
to look at sometimes.

01:58:15.634 --> 01:58:17.113
Not now, when you've been crying.

01:58:17.194 --> 01:58:18.912
You look like the very devil, but...

01:58:18.994 --> 01:58:23.272
...when you're all right and quite yourself
you're what I would call attractive.

01:58:25.114 --> 01:58:27.344
Go to bed, have a good rest,
get up in the morning...

01:58:27.434 --> 01:58:31.063
...and have a look at yourself in the glass.
You won't feel so bad.

01:58:35.354 --> 01:58:39.029
I daresay, my mother might find some
fellow or other who would do very well.

01:58:39.114 --> 01:58:41.150
We were above that at Covent Garden.

01:58:41.234 --> 01:58:42.633
What do you mean?

01:58:42.834 --> 01:58:45.268
I sold flowers, I didn't sell myself.

01:58:45.994 --> 01:58:48.986
Now you've made a lady of me,
I'm not fit to sell anything else.

01:58:49.074 --> 01:58:51.634
Oh, tosh, Eliza.
Don't insult human relations...

01:58:51.714 --> 01:58:54.626
...by dragging all that cant
about buying and selling into it.

01:58:54.714 --> 01:58:56.705
Don't marry the fellow if you don't want to.

01:58:56.794 --> 01:58:58.352
What else am I to do?

01:58:58.434 --> 01:59:00.186
Oh, there are lots of things.

01:59:00.274 --> 01:59:02.583
What about the old idea of a florist shop?

01:59:02.674 --> 01:59:05.586
I'm sure Pickering'd set you up in one.
He's got lots of money.

01:59:05.674 --> 01:59:07.551
He'll pay for all those togs you're wearing.

01:59:07.634 --> 01:59:11.547
And that with the hire of the jewelry'll
make a big hole in 200 pounds.

01:59:11.754 --> 01:59:14.029
Come on now. You'll be all right.

01:59:15.154 --> 01:59:18.191
Well, I must be off to bed.
I'm really devilish sleepy.

01:59:19.474 --> 01:59:21.669
I was looking for something. What was it?

01:59:21.754 --> 01:59:22.903
Your slippers.

01:59:23.394 --> 01:59:26.033
Oh, yes, of course. You shied them at me.

01:59:27.114 --> 01:59:29.309
Before you go, sir.

01:59:32.914 --> 01:59:35.792
Do my clothes belong to me
or to Colonel Pickering?

01:59:36.834 --> 01:59:38.950
What the devil use would they be
to Pickering?

01:59:39.034 --> 01:59:40.945
Why bother about that
in the middle of the night?

01:59:41.034 --> 01:59:42.433
What may I take away with me?

01:59:42.514 --> 01:59:44.823
I don't want to be accused of stealing.

01:59:45.474 --> 01:59:46.509
Stealing?

01:59:47.554 --> 01:59:50.705
You shouldn't have said that.
That shows a want of feeling.

01:59:50.794 --> 01:59:54.673
I'm sorry. I'm a common, ignorant girl
and in my station I have to be careful.

01:59:54.754 --> 01:59:58.064
There can't be any feelings between
the likes of you and the likes of me.

01:59:58.154 --> 02:00:01.510
Please, will you tell me
what belongs to me and what doesn't?

02:00:01.954 --> 02:00:04.229
Take the whole damned houseful
if you want.

02:00:04.314 --> 02:00:06.953
Except the jewelry. That's hired.
Will that satisfy you?

02:00:07.034 --> 02:00:08.228
Stop, please.

02:00:10.354 --> 02:00:13.266
Will you take these to your room
and keep them safe?

02:00:14.074 --> 02:00:16.872
I don't want to run the risk
of them being missed.

02:00:18.394 --> 02:00:21.750
Hand them over! If these belonged
to me and not the jeweler, I'd...

02:00:21.834 --> 02:00:24.302
...l'd ram them down
your ungrateful throat.

02:00:24.594 --> 02:00:28.507
The ring isn't the jeweler's.
It's the one you bought me in Brighton.

02:00:29.794 --> 02:00:31.273
I don't want it now.

02:00:34.394 --> 02:00:35.986
Don't you hit me!

02:00:36.474 --> 02:00:39.511
Hit you? You infamous creature!
How dare you suggest such a thing!

02:00:39.594 --> 02:00:42.154
It's you who've hit me.
You've wounded me to the heart.

02:00:42.234 --> 02:00:45.670
I'm glad. I've got a little
of my own back anyhow.

02:00:46.794 --> 02:00:50.230
You've caused me to lose my temper.
That's hardly happened to me before.

02:00:50.314 --> 02:00:52.987
I don't wish to discuss it further tonight.
I'm going to bed.

02:00:53.074 --> 02:00:55.542
Leave your own note for Mrs. Pearce
about the coffee...

02:00:55.634 --> 02:00:57.147
...for it won't be done by me!

02:00:57.234 --> 02:01:00.670
Damn Mrs. Pearce,
damn the coffee and damn you!

02:01:01.874 --> 02:01:04.991
Damn my own folly for having lavished
my hard-earned knowledge...

02:01:05.074 --> 02:01:09.067
...and the treasure of my regard
and intimacy on a heartless guttersnipe!

02:01:58.234 --> 02:02:02.671
"Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins
Just you wait!

02:02:04.554 --> 02:02:08.627
"You'll be sorry
But your tears will be too late

02:02:10.554 --> 02:02:13.307
"You will be the one it's done to

02:02:14.074 --> 02:02:17.191
"And you'll have no one to run to

02:02:17.754 --> 02:02:19.267
"Just you wait"

02:02:46.794 --> 02:02:51.345
"I have often walked
down this street before

02:02:52.314 --> 02:02:56.944
"But the pavement always stayed

"Just to know somehow you are near

Darling.

02:04:06.394 --> 02:04:08.066
Freddy, whatever are you doing here?

02:04:08.154 --> 02:04:11.863
Nothing. I spend most of my nights here.
It's the only place where I'm happy.

02:04:11.954 --> 02:04:13.512
Don't laugh at me, Miss Doolittle.

02:04:13.594 --> 02:04:17.746
Don't you call me "Miss Doolittle,"
do you hear? Eliza's good enough for me.

02:04:19.594 --> 02:04:23.030
Freddy, you don't think
I'm a heartless guttersnipe, do you?

02:04:23.114 --> 02:04:26.072
Darling, how could you imagine
such a thing? You know how I feel.

02:04:26.154 --> 02:04:29.464
I've written two and three times a day
telling you. Sheets and sheets.

-To the river.

-What for?
-To make a hole in it.

02:06:36.794 --> 02:06:38.864
Eliza, darling, what do you mean?

02:06:48.034 --> 02:06:50.025

-I have.

Yes, please.

02:08:45.634 --> 02:08:47.784
Good morning, miss. Can I help you?

02:08:50.994 --> 02:08:52.950
Do you mind if I warm my hands?

02:08:53.074 --> 02:08:54.587
Go right ahead, miss.

02:09:02.834 --> 02:09:05.587
Excuse me. For a second
I thought you were somebody else.

02:09:05.674 --> 02:09:06.629
Who?

02:09:07.194 --> 02:09:10.743
Forgive me, ma'am. Early morning light
playing tricks with my eyes.

02:09:10.834 --> 02:09:13.632
Can I get you a taxi?
A lady shouldn't be walkin' alone...

02:09:13.714 --> 02:09:16.182
...around London this hour of the morning.

02:09:17.714 --> 02:09:19.067
No, thank you.

"Loverly"

02:10:03.634 --> 02:10:07.673
Do come again, Mr. Doolittle.
We value your patronage always.

02:10:07.754 --> 02:10:10.666
Thank you, my good man. Thank you.
Here. Come 'ere.

02:10:11.434 --> 02:10:13.902
Take the missus on a trip to Brighton
with my compliments.

02:10:13.994 --> 02:10:15.746
Thank you, Mr. Doolittle.

02:10:16.994 --> 02:10:20.031
Jolly spot this, Harry.
We must visit it more often.

02:10:20.994 --> 02:10:21.904
Father?

02:10:24.074 --> 02:10:27.271
Oh, no. You see, Harry, he has no mercy.

02:10:27.554 --> 02:10:31.467
Sent her down to spy on me in me misery,
he did. Me own flesh and blood.

02:10:34.314 --> 02:10:37.272
Well, I'm miserable, all right.
You can tell him that straight.

02:10:37.354 --> 02:10:39.914
What are you talking about?
What are you dressed up for?

02:10:39.994 --> 02:10:41.347
As if you didn't know.

02:10:41.434 --> 02:10:45.268
Go on back to that Wimpole Street devil.
Tell him what he's done to me.

02:10:45.474 --> 02:10:47.032
What's he done to you?

02:10:47.434 --> 02:10:48.628
Ruined me, that's all.

02:10:48.714 --> 02:10:52.389
Tied me up and delivered me
into the hands of middle-class morality.

02:10:52.794 --> 02:10:54.113
And don't you defend him.

02:10:54.194 --> 02:10:58.551
Was it 'im or was it not 'im wrote to an old
American blighter named Wallingford...

02:10:58.634 --> 02:11:02.627
...who was giving $5,000,000
to found Moral Reform societies...

02:11:03.114 --> 02:11:07.505
...to tell him the most original moralist
in England was Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle...

02:11:07.594 --> 02:11:09.073
...a common dustman?

02:11:10.514 --> 02:11:12.391
Sounds like one of his jokes.

02:11:12.554 --> 02:11:15.626
You may call it a joke.
It's put the lid on me. Proper.

02:11:15.914 --> 02:11:19.987
The old bloke died and left me
4,000 pounds a year in his bloomin' will.

02:11:21.354 --> 02:11:25.313
Who asked him to make a gentleman
outta me? I was 'appy. I was free.

02:11:25.874 --> 02:11:29.913
I touched pretty nigh everyone for money
when I wanted it, same as I touched him.

02:11:29.994 --> 02:11:33.464
Now I'm tied neck and 'eels
and everybody touches me.

02:11:34.154 --> 02:11:36.907
A year ago I 'adn't a relation in the world...

02:11:37.594 --> 02:11:39.585
...except one or two
who wouldn't speak to me.

02:11:39.674 --> 02:11:43.144
Now I've 50. Not a decent week's wages
amongst the lot of them.

02:11:43.754 --> 02:11:48.225
I have to live for others now,
not for meself. Middle-class morality.

02:11:48.914 --> 02:11:52.111
Come on, Alfie, in a few hours
we have to be at the church.

02:11:52.194 --> 02:11:54.310
-Church?
-Yeah, church.

02:11:55.274 --> 02:11:57.105
The deepest cut of all.

02:11:57.594 --> 02:12:00.666
Why do you think I'm dressed up
like a ruddy pallbearer?

02:12:01.194 --> 02:12:03.025
Your stepmother wants to marry me.

02:12:03.114 --> 02:12:05.833
Now I'm respectable,
she wants to be respectable.

02:12:06.114 --> 02:12:09.345
If that's the way you feel,
why don't you give the money back?

02:12:09.434 --> 02:12:11.425
That's the tragedy of it, Eliza.

02:12:11.674 --> 02:12:13.471
It's easy to say chuck it...

02:12:14.274 --> 02:12:16.026
...but I 'aven't the nerve.

02:12:16.354 --> 02:12:18.868
We're all intimidated.
That's what we are, intimidated.

02:12:18.954 --> 02:12:21.514
Bought up. Yeah. That's what I am.

02:12:22.234 --> 02:12:24.794
That's what your precious professor's
brought me to.

02:12:24.874 --> 02:12:26.785
Not my precious professor.

02:12:27.474 --> 02:12:29.305
Oh, sent you back, 'as he?

02:12:30.914 --> 02:12:35.624
First he shoves me in the middle-class,
then he chucks you out for me to support.

02:12:36.234 --> 02:12:38.145
That's all part of his plan...

02:12:38.754 --> 02:12:40.585
...but you double-cross him.

02:12:41.154 --> 02:12:45.147
Don't you come back home to me.
Don't you take tuppence from me.

02:12:45.714 --> 02:12:49.104
You stand on your own two feet.
You're a lady now, you can do it.

02:12:49.194 --> 02:12:52.027
Yeah, that's right, Eliza.
You're a lady now.

02:12:52.674 --> 02:12:54.665
It's getting awfully cold in that taxi.

02:12:54.754 --> 02:12:58.713
Here, Eliza, would you like to come
and see me turned off this morning?

02:12:58.794 --> 02:13:01.262
St. George's, Hanover Square, 10:00.

02:13:01.394 --> 02:13:03.350
I wouldn't advise it, but you're welcome.

02:13:03.434 --> 02:13:04.867
No, thank you, Dad.

02:13:05.994 --> 02:13:08.064
Are you all finished here, Eliza?

02:13:08.634 --> 02:13:11.512
Yes, Freddy, I'm all finished here.

02:13:15.274 --> 02:13:16.502
Good luck, Dad.

02:13:16.874 --> 02:13:18.227
Thank you, Eliza.

02:13:35.274 --> 02:13:36.263
Come along, Alfie.

02:13:36.354 --> 02:13:38.072

There's drinks and girls all over London.

02:13:52.394 --> 02:13:56.023
And I gotta track 'em down
in just a few more hours.

02:13:56.834 --> 02:13:58.472

Get me to the church on time

02:16:54.754 --> 02:16:58.190
"Girls come and kiss him
Show how they miss him

"But get him to the church on time

"Kick up a rumpus
But don't lose the compass

02:17:13.834 --> 02:17:16.906
"And get him to the church on time

02:17:17.474 --> 02:17:20.671
"If I am flyin'
Then shoot me down

02:17:21.154 --> 02:17:24.624
"If I am wooin'

"For God's sake

02:19:12.114 --> 02:19:14.025
"...on time"

02:19:24.474 --> 02:19:26.465
Didn't she say where to send her clothes?

02:19:26.554 --> 02:19:29.114
I told you, sir, she took them all with her.

02:19:29.273 --> 02:19:31.993
Here's a confounded thing. Eliza's bolted.

02:19:32.074 --> 02:19:35.191
Last night Mrs. Pearce let her go
without telling me about it!

02:19:35.273 --> 02:19:37.708
What'll I do? I got tea this morning
instead of coffee.

02:19:37.794 --> 02:19:40.353
I don't know where anything is,
what my appointments are.

02:19:40.433 --> 02:19:42.152
-Eliza'd know.
-Damn it, she's gone!

02:19:42.234 --> 02:19:44.270
Did either of you frighten her last night?

02:19:44.353 --> 02:19:46.469
We hardly said a word to her.
You were there.

02:19:46.554 --> 02:19:48.306
Did you bully her after I went to bed?

02:19:48.394 --> 02:19:49.713
She threw the slippers at me.

02:19:49.794 --> 02:19:51.625
I never gave her the slightest provocation.

02:19:51.714 --> 02:19:54.103
The slippers came at my head
before I uttered a word.

02:19:54.194 --> 02:19:57.903
She used the most disgraceful language.
I was shocked! I don't understand.

02:19:57.994 --> 02:20:00.554
We always gave her every consideration.
She admitted it.

02:20:00.634 --> 02:20:01.464
I'm dashed!

02:20:01.554 --> 02:20:04.944
Pickering, for God's sake,
stop being dashed and do something!

02:20:05.034 --> 02:20:07.548
Phone the police. What are they there for?

02:20:07.634 --> 02:20:10.023
You can't give Eliza's name to the police...

02:20:10.114 --> 02:20:12.150
...as if she were a thief or a lost umbrella.

02:20:12.234 --> 02:20:14.065
But why not? I want to find the girl.

02:20:14.154 --> 02:20:16.748
She belongs to me.
I paid five pounds for her.

02:20:16.994 --> 02:20:19.554
Quite right. Hello. Scotland Yard, please?

02:20:19.874 --> 02:20:22.104
Get me some coffee, would you please?

02:20:22.914 --> 02:20:24.108
Scotland Yard?

02:20:24.794 --> 02:20:28.548
This is Colonel Pickering speaking.

02:20:29.594 --> 02:20:32.154
27 A Wimpole Street.

02:20:32.634 --> 02:20:34.784
I want to report a missing person.

02:20:35.434 --> 02:20:37.629
Miss Eliza Doolittle.

02:20:38.594 --> 02:20:39.629
About 21 .

02:20:40.674 --> 02:20:43.427
I should say about 5 foot 7.

02:20:44.634 --> 02:20:48.422
Her eyes? Let me think now. Her eyes....

02:20:48.754 --> 02:20:50.426
-Brown.
-Brown.

02:20:53.074 --> 02:20:57.590
Her hair? Good Lord.
Sort of a nondescript neutral sort of--

02:20:57.674 --> 02:20:59.232
Brown, brown, brown!

02:20:59.354 --> 02:21:01.914
You heard what he said?
Brown, brown, brown, yes.

02:21:01.994 --> 02:21:04.383
No. This is her residence. 27 A--

02:21:04.474 --> 02:21:08.103
Yes, about between 3:00 and 4:00
this morning, I understand.

02:21:09.234 --> 02:21:12.192
No.... She's no relation, no.

02:21:13.114 --> 02:21:15.912
Well, let's call her a good friend, shall we?

02:21:16.354 --> 02:21:17.753
I beg your pardon?

02:21:17.874 --> 02:21:20.513
Listen to me, I don't like the tenor
of that question.

02:21:20.594 --> 02:21:22.869
What the girl does here is our affair.

02:21:24.114 --> 02:21:27.424
Your affair is to get her back
so she can continue doing it.

02:21:28.034 --> 02:21:29.467
Well, I'm dashed!

02:21:31.914 --> 02:21:34.792
"What in heaven
could have prompted her to go?

02:21:34.874 --> 02:21:36.944
"After such a triumph at the ball

02:21:37.754 --> 02:21:39.233
"What could have depressed her?

02:21:39.314 --> 02:21:43.102
"What could have possessed her?
I cannot understand the wretch at all"

02:21:45.194 --> 02:21:49.153
Higgins, I have an old school chum
at the Home Office. Perhaps he could help.

02:21:49.234 --> 02:21:50.986
Think I'll give him a ring.

02:21:52.474 --> 02:21:55.068
Whitehall: 7244, please.

02:21:57.634 --> 02:22:00.194
"Women are irrational
That's all there is to that

02:22:00.274 --> 02:22:02.834
"Their heads are full of
Cotton, hay and rags

02:22:03.234 --> 02:22:06.829
"They're nothing but exasperating
Irritating, vacillating, calculating

02:22:06.914 --> 02:22:09.553
"Agitating, maddening
And infuriating hags"

02:22:11.034 --> 02:22:14.071
I want to speak
to Mr. Brewster Budgin, please.

02:22:14.994 --> 02:22:16.347
Yes, I'll wait.

02:22:21.514 --> 02:22:25.393
Pickering, why can't a woman
be more like a man?

02:22:26.234 --> 02:22:27.633
I beg your pardon?

02:22:27.874 --> 02:22:31.025
Yes, why can't a woman
be more like a man?

02:22:31.874 --> 02:22:34.468
"Men are so honest, so thoroughly square

02:22:34.874 --> 02:22:37.513
"Eternally noble, historically fair

02:22:38.154 --> 02:22:41.066
"Who, when you win
Will always give your back a pat?

02:22:41.434 --> 02:22:43.629
"Why can't a woman be like that?

02:22:44.994 --> 02:22:47.383
"Why does every one do
What the others do?

02:22:48.274 --> 02:22:50.504
"Can't a woman learn to use her head?

02:22:51.594 --> 02:22:54.108
"Why do they do everything
Their mothers do?

02:22:54.314 --> 02:22:57.511
"Why don't they grow up
Well, like their father instead?

02:22:57.714 --> 02:23:00.103
"Why can't a woman take after a man?

02:23:00.714 --> 02:23:03.467
"Men are so pleasant, so easy to please

02:23:03.954 --> 02:23:06.673
"Whenever you're with them
You're always at ease

02:23:07.154 --> 02:23:10.032
"Would you be slighted
If I didn't speak for hours?

02:23:10.194 --> 02:23:12.708
"Would you be livid
If I had a drink or two?

02:23:13.394 --> 02:23:16.192
"Would you be wounded
If I never sent you flowers?

02:23:16.314 --> 02:23:18.953
"Well, why can't a woman be like you?

02:23:20.314 --> 02:23:22.544
"One man in a million may shout a bit

02:23:23.554 --> 02:23:26.114
"Now and then
There's one with slight defects

02:23:26.794 --> 02:23:29.149
"One perhaps whose truthfulness
You doubt a bit

02:23:29.234 --> 02:23:32.829
"But by and large
We are a marvelous sex

02:23:33.114 --> 02:23:35.423
"Why can't a woman take after a man?

02:23:36.114 --> 02:23:38.833
"Cause men are so friendly
Good-natured and kind

02:23:39.274 --> 02:23:41.868
"A better companion
You never will find

02:23:42.594 --> 02:23:45.347
"If I were hours late for dinner
Would you bellow?

02:23:45.634 --> 02:23:48.353
"If I forgot your silly birthday
Would you fuss?

02:23:48.714 --> 02:23:51.467
"Would you complain
If I took out another fellow?

02:23:51.834 --> 02:23:54.428
"Well, why can't a woman be like us?"

02:23:58.034 --> 02:23:59.911
Is Mr. Brewster Budgin there?

02:24:00.434 --> 02:24:04.109
Bruzzie, you'll never guess who this is.

02:24:05.834 --> 02:24:09.463
You're quite right, it is. Good heavens.
By George, what a memory.

02:24:10.514 --> 02:24:13.074
How are you, Bruzzie?
Nice to hear your voice.

02:24:14.074 --> 02:24:17.305
What? You don't say.
Has it really been 30 years, Bruzzie?

02:24:17.714 --> 02:24:18.908
Right. Yes, oceans of water.

02:24:18.994 --> 02:24:21.144
Listen, Bruzzie, I'll tell you why I rang up.

02:24:21.234 --> 02:24:24.829
Something rather unpleasant
has happened. Could I come and see you?

02:24:24.914 --> 02:24:26.870
I could, yes. Now, straight away?

02:24:26.954 --> 02:24:28.069
Right. Good. Thank you.

02:24:28.154 --> 02:24:30.463
Goodbye, Bruzzie. Thank you very much.

02:24:37.314 --> 02:24:40.033
Mrs. Pearce, I'm going along
to the Home Office.

02:24:40.714 --> 02:24:42.909
I do hope you find her, Colonel Pickering.

02:24:42.994 --> 02:24:44.712
Mr. Higgins will miss her.

02:24:44.914 --> 02:24:48.384
Mr. Higgins will miss her, eh?
Blast Mr. Higgins, I'll miss her!

02:24:59.834 --> 02:25:01.870
-Mrs. Pearce?
-Yes, sir.

02:25:02.234 --> 02:25:03.189
Where's the Colonel?

02:25:03.274 --> 02:25:05.344
He's gone to the Home Office, sir.

02:25:06.354 --> 02:25:11.109
There you are. I'm disturbed and he runs
for help. Now there's a good fellow.

02:25:12.874 --> 02:25:15.149
Mrs. Pearce, you're a woman.

02:25:16.434 --> 02:25:19.153
"Why can't a woman be more like a man?

02:25:19.954 --> 02:25:22.673
"Men are so decent
Such regular chaps

02:25:23.074 --> 02:25:25.588
"Ready to help you
Through any mishaps

02:25:26.194 --> 02:25:28.662
"Ready to buck you up
Whenever you are glum

02:25:29.234 --> 02:25:31.794
"Why can't a woman be a chum?

02:25:32.994 --> 02:25:35.383
"Why is thinking
Something women never do?

02:25:36.274 --> 02:25:38.629
"And why is logic never even tried?

02:25:39.354 --> 02:25:42.073
"Straightening up their hair
Is all they ever do

02:25:42.274 --> 02:25:45.584
"Why don't they straighten up
The mess that's inside?

02:25:45.674 --> 02:25:48.142
"Why can't a woman behave like a man?

02:25:48.834 --> 02:25:51.302
"If I was a woman

"Been hailed as a princess
By one and by all

02:25:55.154 --> 02:25:57.952
"Would I start weeping
Like a bathtub overflowing?

02:25:58.114 --> 02:26:00.582
"Or carry on as if my home were in a tree?

02:26:01.114 --> 02:26:03.992
"Would I run off
And never tell me where I'm going?

02:26:04.234 --> 02:26:06.828
"Why can't a woman be like me?"

02:26:10.994 --> 02:26:13.952
You mean that after you'd done
this wonderful thing for them...

02:26:14.034 --> 02:26:15.467
...without making a mistake...

02:26:15.554 --> 02:26:17.465
...they just sat there
and never said a word?

02:26:17.554 --> 02:26:21.183
Never petted you, or admired you,
or told you how splendid you'd been?

02:26:21.274 --> 02:26:21.911
Not a word.

02:26:21.994 --> 02:26:25.066
They just congratulated each other
on how marvelous they'd been.

02:26:25.154 --> 02:26:27.543
The next moment, how glad they were
it was all over...

02:26:27.634 --> 02:26:29.352
...and what a bore it had all been.

02:26:29.434 --> 02:26:32.551
This is appalling. I should not
have thrown my slippers at him.

02:26:32.634 --> 02:26:34.784
I should have thrown the fire irons.

02:26:34.914 --> 02:26:36.029
Who's that?

02:26:36.154 --> 02:26:38.748
Henry. I knew it wouldn't be too long.

02:26:40.274 --> 02:26:41.593
Now, remember...

02:26:42.314 --> 02:26:46.466
...you not only danced with a prince
last night, you behaved like a princess.

02:26:53.074 --> 02:26:55.668
Mother, the most confounded thing....
Do you--

02:26:59.074 --> 02:26:59.950
You!

02:27:00.754 --> 02:27:03.746
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins.
Are you quite well?

02:27:05.154 --> 02:27:09.113
Of course you are. You are never ill.
Would you care for some tea?

02:27:09.874 --> 02:27:12.627
Don't you dare try that game on me.
I taught it to you.

02:27:12.714 --> 02:27:14.386
Get up, come home and stop being a fool.

02:27:14.474 --> 02:27:15.953
You've caused me enough trouble.

02:27:16.034 --> 02:27:19.868
Very nicely put indeed, Henry.
No woman could resist such an invitation.

02:27:19.954 --> 02:27:21.467
How did this baggage get here?

02:27:21.554 --> 02:27:24.387
Eliza came to see me this morning
and I was delighted to have her.

02:27:24.474 --> 02:27:27.307
If you don't promise to behave yourself
I'll ask you to leave.

02:27:27.394 --> 02:27:29.305
I'm to put on my Sunday manners
for this...

02:27:29.394 --> 02:27:33.023
...thing that I created out of the squashed
cabbage leaves of Covent Garden?

02:27:33.114 --> 02:27:34.786
That's precisely what I mean.

02:27:34.874 --> 02:27:36.387
I'll see her damned first.

02:27:36.474 --> 02:27:39.466
However did you learn good manners
with my son around?

02:27:39.674 --> 02:27:43.826
It was very difficult. I should never have
known how ladies and gentlemen behave...

02:27:43.914 --> 02:27:46.428
...if it hadn't been for Colonel Pickering.

02:27:47.794 --> 02:27:49.944
He showed me that he felt
and thought about me...

02:27:50.034 --> 02:27:53.265
...as if I were something better
than a common flower girl.

02:27:55.794 --> 02:27:59.230
You see, Mrs. Higgins,
apart from the things one can pick up...

02:27:59.394 --> 02:28:02.989
...the difference between a lady
and a flower girl isn't how she behaves...

02:28:03.074 --> 02:28:04.792
...but how she is treated.

02:28:07.474 --> 02:28:09.863
I'll always be a flower girl
to Professor Higgins...

02:28:09.954 --> 02:28:13.424
...because he always treats me
as a flower girl and always will.

02:28:14.114 --> 02:28:16.150
I'll always be a lady to Colonel Pickering...

02:28:16.234 --> 02:28:19.385
...because he always treats me
as a lady and always will.

02:28:24.074 --> 02:28:25.473
Henry, don't grind your teeth.

02:28:25.554 --> 02:28:28.273
The bishop is here.
Shall I show him into the garden?

02:28:28.354 --> 02:28:30.743
The bishop and the professor?
Good heavens, no!

02:28:30.834 --> 02:28:32.586
I should be excommunicated.

02:28:32.874 --> 02:28:34.705
I'll see him in the library.

02:28:35.434 --> 02:28:37.994
Eliza, if my son starts breaking up things...

02:28:38.194 --> 02:28:40.788
...I give you full permission
to have him evicted.

02:28:40.874 --> 02:28:44.913
Henry, I suggest you stick to two subjects:
the weather and your health.

02:29:11.594 --> 02:29:13.550
You've had a bit of your own back,
as you say.

02:29:13.634 --> 02:29:16.910
Have you had enough and will you
be reasonable or do you want any more?

02:29:16.994 --> 02:29:18.905
You want me back to pick up
your slippers...

02:29:18.994 --> 02:29:21.906
...and put up with your tempers
and fetch and carry for you.

02:29:21.994 --> 02:29:23.712
I didn't say I wanted you back at all.

02:29:23.794 --> 02:29:25.113
Then what are we talking about?

02:29:25.194 --> 02:29:26.752
Well, about you, not about me.

02:29:26.834 --> 02:29:29.428
If you come back you'll be treated
as you always have.

02:29:29.514 --> 02:29:31.664
I can't change my nature or my manners.

02:29:31.754 --> 02:29:34.473
My manners are exactly
the same as Colonel Pickering's.

02:29:34.554 --> 02:29:38.183
That's not true. He treats a flower girl
as if she were a duchess.

02:29:38.314 --> 02:29:40.464
I treat a duchess
as if she was a flower girl.

02:29:40.554 --> 02:29:42.624
I see. The same to everybody.

02:29:43.074 --> 02:29:45.713
The great secret is not a question
of good manners...

02:29:45.794 --> 02:29:49.104
...or bad manners
or any particular sort of manner...

02:29:49.594 --> 02:29:52.825
...but having the same manner
for all human souls.

02:29:54.634 --> 02:29:56.943
The question is not
whether I treat you rudely...

02:29:57.034 --> 02:30:00.310
...but whether you've ever heard me
treat anyone else better.

02:30:00.394 --> 02:30:02.271
I don't care how you treat me.

02:30:02.354 --> 02:30:05.312
I don't mind your swearing at me.
I shouldn't mind a black eye.

02:30:05.394 --> 02:30:08.352
I've had one before this.
But I won't be passed over!

02:30:08.554 --> 02:30:10.351
Get out of my way,
for I won't stop for you.

02:30:10.434 --> 02:30:12.470
You talk about me as though
I was a motorbus.

02:30:12.554 --> 02:30:16.593
So you are a motorbus. All bounce and go
and no consideration for anybody.

02:30:16.834 --> 02:30:19.473
But I can get along without you.
Don't you think I can't!

02:30:19.554 --> 02:30:21.863
I know you can. I told you, you could.

02:30:25.154 --> 02:30:27.622
You've never wondered, I suppose,
whether...

02:30:27.714 --> 02:30:30.148
...whether I could get along without you?

02:30:31.194 --> 02:30:34.106
Don't you try to get around me.
You'll have to.

02:30:35.274 --> 02:30:37.788
So I can, without you or any soul on earth.

02:30:40.794 --> 02:30:44.833
I shall miss you, Eliza. I've learned
something from your idiotic notions.

02:30:45.474 --> 02:30:47.908
I confess that humbly and gratefully.

02:30:50.754 --> 02:30:53.029
Well, you have my voice
on your gramophone.

02:30:53.114 --> 02:30:57.426
When you feel lonely without me you can
turn it on. It has no feelings to hurt.

02:30:58.874 --> 02:31:01.513
Well, I can't turn your soul on.

02:31:04.074 --> 02:31:06.224
You are a devil!

02:31:07.154 --> 02:31:09.543
You can twist the heart in a girl
just as easily...

02:31:09.634 --> 02:31:11.989
...as some can twist her arms to hurt her.

02:31:12.074 --> 02:31:13.826
What am I to come back for?

02:31:14.154 --> 02:31:16.145
For the fun of it. That's why I took you on.

02:31:16.234 --> 02:31:18.873
You may throw me out tomorrow
if I don't do everything you want.

02:31:18.954 --> 02:31:22.230
Yes. And you may walk out tomorrow
if I don't do everything you want.

02:31:22.314 --> 02:31:23.463
And live with my father?

02:31:23.554 --> 02:31:25.988
Yes, or sell flowers.
Would you rather marry Pickering?

02:31:26.074 --> 02:31:29.669
I wouldn't marry you if you asked me
and you're nearer my age then what he is.

02:31:29.754 --> 02:31:32.826
-Than he is.
-I'll talk as I like, you're not my teacher.

02:31:32.914 --> 02:31:35.633
That's not what I want
and don't you think it is.

02:31:35.714 --> 02:31:37.864
I've always had chaps enough
wanting me that way.

02:31:37.954 --> 02:31:40.912
Freddy Hill writes me twice
and three times a day. Sheets and sheets.

02:31:40.994 --> 02:31:44.782
In short, you want me to be
as infatuated about you as he is, is that it?

02:31:44.874 --> 02:31:48.708
No, I don't. That's not the sort of feeling
I want from you.

02:31:49.754 --> 02:31:51.426
I want a little kindness.

02:31:51.834 --> 02:31:55.383
I know I'm a common, ignorant girl,
and you're a book-learned gentleman...

02:31:55.474 --> 02:31:57.624
...but I'm not dirt under your feet.

02:31:57.874 --> 02:32:02.664
What I done...what I did was not
for the taxis and the dresses...

02:32:03.074 --> 02:32:06.589
...but because we were pleasant together
and I come to...came...

02:32:07.874 --> 02:32:09.307
...to care for you.

02:32:09.594 --> 02:32:11.312
Not to want you to make love to me...

02:32:11.394 --> 02:32:14.352
...and not forgetting the difference
between us, but...

02:32:14.434 --> 02:32:16.026
...more friendly like.

02:32:18.154 --> 02:32:20.304
Well, of course. That's how I feel.

02:32:20.914 --> 02:32:24.350
And how Pickering feels.
Eliza, you're a fool!

02:32:24.434 --> 02:32:25.753
That's not the proper answer.

02:32:25.834 --> 02:32:27.711
It's the only answer
till you stop being an idiot.

02:32:27.794 --> 02:32:29.864
To be a lady, you must stop
feeling neglected...

02:32:29.954 --> 02:32:32.468
...if men don't spend half their time
sniveling over you...

02:32:32.554 --> 02:32:34.510
...and the other half giving you black eyes.

02:32:34.594 --> 02:32:36.903
You find me cold, unfeeling, selfish,
don't you?

02:32:36.994 --> 02:32:38.985
Off with you to the sort of people you like.

02:32:39.074 --> 02:32:40.905
Marry a sentimental hog
with lots of money...

02:32:40.994 --> 02:32:43.633
...and thick lips to kiss you,
and thick boots to kick you.

02:32:43.714 --> 02:32:46.751
If you can't appreciate what you have,
then get what you can appreciate.

02:32:47.074 --> 02:32:49.793
I can't talk to you.
You always turn everything against me.

02:32:49.874 --> 02:32:51.512
I'm always in the wrong.

02:32:51.714 --> 02:32:53.864
Don't be too sure you have me
under your feet...

02:32:53.954 --> 02:32:55.990
...to be trampled on and talked down.

02:32:56.074 --> 02:32:59.464
I'll marry Freddy, I will,
as soon as I'm able to support him.

02:33:00.874 --> 02:33:03.388
The poor devil who couldn't get a job
as an errand boy...

02:33:03.474 --> 02:33:05.351
...even if he had the guts to try?

02:33:05.434 --> 02:33:09.029
Don't you understand?
I have made you a consort for a king!

02:33:09.194 --> 02:33:12.027
Freddy loves me.
That makes him king enough for me.

02:33:12.114 --> 02:33:14.992
I don't want him to work.
He wasn't brought up to do it as I was.

02:33:15.074 --> 02:33:16.746
I'll go and be a teacher.

02:33:17.154 --> 02:33:19.065
What'll you teach, in heaven's name?

02:33:19.154 --> 02:33:21.588
What you taught me. I'll teach phonetics.

02:33:25.794 --> 02:33:29.867
I'll offer myself as an assistant
to that brilliant Hungarian.

02:33:30.714 --> 02:33:34.229
What, that imposter? That humbug?
That toadying ignoramus?

02:33:34.594 --> 02:33:36.664
Teach him my methods, my discoveries?

02:33:36.754 --> 02:33:39.268
You take one step in that direction,
I'll wring your neck!

02:33:39.354 --> 02:33:42.664
Wring away! What do I care?
I knew you'd strike me one day.

02:33:45.794 --> 02:33:48.627
That's done you, 'Enry 'lggins, it 'as.

02:33:48.714 --> 02:33:51.672
Now, I don't care for your bullyin'
an' your big talk.

02:33:52.914 --> 02:33:54.711
"What a fool I was

02:33:54.794 --> 02:33:56.352
"What a dominated fool

02:33:56.634 --> 02:33:59.307
"To think you were the earth and sky

02:33:59.874 --> 02:34:01.512
"What a fool I was

02:34:01.594 --> 02:34:03.232
"What an addle-pated fool

"What a mutton-headed dolt was I

"No, my reverberating friend

"You are not the beginning and the end"

02:34:17.954 --> 02:34:19.387
You impudent hussy!

02:34:19.594 --> 02:34:23.951
There's not an idea in your head or a word
in your mouth that I haven't put there.

02:34:25.394 --> 02:34:29.785
"There'll be spring every year without you

02:34:30.594 --> 02:34:33.666
"England still will be here without you

02:34:34.354 --> 02:34:37.903
"There'll be fruit on the tree
And a shore by the sea

"There'll be crumpets and tea without you

"Art and music will thrive without you

"Somehow Keats will survive without you

"And there still will be rain

"Even that will remain without you

02:34:56.354 --> 02:34:58.026
"I can do...

"...without you

"You can go to

02:36:12.914 --> 02:36:14.632
Eliza, you're magnificent.

02:36:14.994 --> 02:36:17.383
Five minutes ago you were
a millstone around my neck...

02:36:17.474 --> 02:36:19.430
...and now you're a tower of strength.

02:36:19.514 --> 02:36:21.072
A consort battleship.

02:36:22.394 --> 02:36:23.907
I like you this way.

02:36:26.074 --> 02:36:29.749
Goodbye, Professor Higgins.
You shall not be seeing me again.

02:36:42.834 --> 02:36:43.823
Mother!

02:36:46.994 --> 02:36:49.144
What is it, Henry? What's happened?

02:36:50.874 --> 02:36:51.989
She's gone.

02:36:52.114 --> 02:36:54.582
Well, of course, dear.
What did you expect?

02:36:57.914 --> 02:36:59.063
What am I to do?

02:36:59.154 --> 02:37:00.712
Do without, I suppose.

02:37:02.394 --> 02:37:04.066
And so I shall.

02:37:07.194 --> 02:37:10.072
If the Higgins' oxygen burns up
her little lungs...

02:37:10.194 --> 02:37:12.833
...let her seek some stuffiness
that suits her.

02:37:13.594 --> 02:37:16.950
She's an owl sickened
by a few days of my sunshine.

02:37:17.314 --> 02:37:19.225
Let her go. I can do without her.

02:37:19.314 --> 02:37:21.669
I can do without anyone.
I have my own soul!

02:37:21.754 --> 02:37:24.473
My own spark of divine fire!

02:37:28.514 --> 02:37:29.788
Bravo, Eliza.

02:37:49.394 --> 02:37:52.431
"Damn, damn, damn, damn

02:37:54.674 --> 02:37:56.744
"I've grown accustomed to her face

"She almost makes the day begin

Accustomed to her looks

Marry Freddy.

02:38:51.794 --> 02:38:55.707
What an infantile idea. What a heartless,
wicked, brainless thing to do.

02:38:56.434 --> 02:38:59.028
But she'll regret it. She'll regret it.

02:38:59.514 --> 02:39:02.074
It's doomed before they even take the vow!

02:39:03.674 --> 02:39:07.189
"I can see her now

02:39:07.354 --> 02:39:09.743

02:39:49.594 --> 02:39:51.027
"How delightful

02:39:53.754 --> 02:39:56.507
"How poignant it will be
On that inevitable night

02:39:56.674 --> 02:39:59.268
"When she hammers on my door
In tears and rags

02:39:59.754 --> 02:40:02.712
"Miserable and lonely
Repentant and contrite

02:40:03.514 --> 02:40:05.903
"Will I take her in
Or hurl her to the wolves?

02:40:05.994 --> 02:40:08.747
"Give her kindness
Or the treatment she deserves?

02:40:09.114 --> 02:40:12.186
"Will I take her back
Or throw the baggage out?

02:40:15.034 --> 02:40:16.990
"Well, I'm a most forgiving man

02:40:17.754 --> 02:40:20.188
"The sort who never could, ever would

02:40:20.634 --> 02:40:23.626
"Take a position
and staunchly never budge

02:40:27.114 --> 02:40:28.752
"A most forgiving man

02:40:31.874 --> 02:40:33.830
"But I shall never take her back

02:40:34.914 --> 02:40:36.984
"If she were crawling on her knees

02:40:37.554 --> 02:40:40.068
"Let her promise to atone
Let her shiver, let her moan

02:40:40.154 --> 02:40:43.669
"I'll slam the door
And let the hellcat freeze"

02:40:46.674 --> 02:40:48.232
Marry Freddy.

02:41:02.514 --> 02:41:04.630
"But I'm so used to hear her say

02:41:05.474 --> 02:41:07.146
"'Good morning' every day

02:41:07.914 --> 02:41:09.791
"Her joys, her woes

02:41:10.434 --> 02:41:12.902
"Her highs, her lows

02:41:13.114 --> 02:41:15.025
"Are second nature to me now

02:41:16.914 --> 02:41:19.064
"Like breathing out and breathing in

02:41:20.834 --> 02:41:24.270
"I'm very grateful she's a woman
And so easy to forget

02:41:25.234 --> 02:41:28.431
"Rather like a habit one can always break

02:41:31.074 --> 02:41:34.908
"And yet I've grown
Accustomed to the trace

02:41:35.874 --> 02:41:38.308
"Of something in the air

02:41:39.714 --> 02:41:44.071
"Accustomed to her face"

02:43:17.714 --> 02:43:22.504
Oh, we are proud. He ain't above
givin' lessons, not 'im. I 'eard 'im say so.

02:43:23.154 --> 02:43:25.190
I ain't come here to ask
for any compliment...

02:43:25.274 --> 02:43:28.186
...and if my money's not good enough,
I can go elsewhere.

02:43:28.274 --> 02:43:29.502
Good enough for what?

02:43:29.594 --> 02:43:32.108
Good enough for you.
Now you know, don't ya?

02:43:32.274 --> 02:43:34.583
I'm come to 'ave lessons.
And to pay for 'em, too...

02:43:34.674 --> 02:43:35.663
...make no mistake.

02:43:35.754 --> 02:43:37.426
What do you want, my girl?

02:43:37.514 --> 02:43:40.745
I want to be a lady in a flow'r shop,
'stead o' sellin'...

02:43:40.874 --> 02:43:43.183
...at the corner of Tottenham Court Road.

02:43:43.274 --> 02:43:47.586
But they won't take me unless I can talk
more genteel. He said he could teach me.

02:43:48.274 --> 02:43:53.064
Well, 'ere I am ready to pay. Not askin'
any favor, and he treats me as if I was dirt.

02:43:53.834 --> 02:43:57.429
I know what lessons cost as well as you do
and I'm ready to pay.

02:43:58.034 --> 02:44:01.071
I won't give more than a shillin'.
Take it or leave it.

02:44:01.394 --> 02:44:05.228
It's almost irresistible.
She's so deliciously low.

02:44:05.994 --> 02:44:08.462
So horribly dirty. I'll take it.

02:44:09.154 --> 02:44:12.191
I'll make a duchess
of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.

02:44:13.954 --> 02:44:16.673
I washed my face and 'ands
before I come, I did.

02:44:30.674 --> 02:44:32.665
Where the devil are my slippers?

02:44:43.074 --> 02:44:46.066
