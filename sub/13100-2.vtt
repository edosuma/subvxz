'Now, let me get this straight
you two are missionaries?'

00:12.333 --> 00:14.542
Yes. Great sigh.

00:14.625 --> 00:16.583
We hear you have
recent visitation

00:16.667 --> 00:18.833
by Drazi higher being.

00:18.917 --> 00:21.125
Uh, yeah, yeah,
uh, Drebunka.

00:21.208 --> 00:24.292
- Droshala.
- Whatever.

00:24.375 --> 00:27.208
Appeared in garden, we hear.

00:27.292 --> 00:29.667
Droshala, lights the way.

00:29.750 --> 00:32.375
- Yeah, great, look, we're up--
- Chief? Got a minute?

00:32.458 --> 00:35.583
Sure, Zack, do me a favor
and explain the missionary,

00:35.667 --> 00:38.792
uh, position to these folks.

00:38.875 --> 00:40.875
Yeah, sure thing, chief.

00:40.958 --> 00:44.417
Okay, so here's how this..
What're you doing?

00:44.500 --> 00:47.958
Droshala visitation
means station blessed.

00:48.042 --> 00:50.792
Everything here blessed.

00:50.875 --> 00:53.750
You also blessed.

00:53.833 --> 00:56.792
We touch to share your blessing.

00:58.833 --> 01:01.750
Oh, don't poke me.
I-I don't like it.

01:01.833 --> 01:05.125
I don't wanna share
my blessing, okay?

01:05.208 --> 01:07.292
You see that plant over there?

01:07.375 --> 01:08.792
'Now, that was in the garden'

01:08.875 --> 01:10.792
when your people
saw this Drobawa.

01:10.875 --> 01:12.875
Droshala!

01:12.958 --> 01:16.333
Right.
Anyway, it was real close.

01:16.417 --> 01:18.500
So, it's got to be
more blessed than me.

01:18.583 --> 01:22.125
So here, why don't you go
poke the plant for a while

01:22.208 --> 01:24.917
while I take care
of your entry visas, okay?

01:25.000 --> 01:26.625

01:37.292 --> 01:39.458
have come into C&amp;C
in the last three hours.

01:39.542 --> 01:42.083
'First one said
"Chaos is four hours away."'

01:42.167 --> 01:43.833
Second one came an hour later
and said

01:43.917 --> 01:45.667
"Chaos is three hours away."

01:45.750 --> 01:47.667
- Then two hours.
- Anything after that?

01:47.750 --> 01:49.500
No, they all came
from a public Babcom unit.

01:49.583 --> 01:51.542
- Audio only.
- Hmm. Sounds like a crank.

01:51.625 --> 01:54.000
- But, uh, I'll look into it.
- Thanks.

01:54.083 --> 01:56.458
Nothing!
Check over there.

01:56.542 --> 02:00.167
There's got to be something
around here we can sell.

02:00.250 --> 02:02.333
- 'I got nothing here.'
- 'Nah.'

but chopping wood.'

The Babylon project
was our last

02:20.958 --> 02:23.250
best hope for peace.

02:26.708 --> 02:28.083
It failed.

02:28.167 --> 02:31.208
[dramatic music]

02:42.875 --> 02:44.708
But in the year
of the Shadow War

02:44.792 --> 02:46.917
it became something greater.

02:47.042 --> 02:48.917
Our last best hope

02:49.000 --> 02:50.583
for victory.

02:55.625 --> 02:57.792
The year is 2260.

03:53.083 --> 03:54.833
Jake, we just had
an explosion in Downbelow.

03:54.917 --> 03:56.583
I need you to get
ten more guys down there.

03:56.667 --> 03:58.208
- Stat for crowd control.
- Alright, will do.

03:58.292 --> 04:01.833
Uh, listen, before you go
we uh, just got another ship in

04:01.917 --> 04:04.958
and, uh, I think you'd better
come have a look.

04:05.042 --> 04:06.917
Yeah, okay, let's go.

04:11.167 --> 04:13.167
[clears throat]

04:13.250 --> 04:14.458
Hello.

04:14.542 --> 04:16.833
I'm Brother Theo.

04:16.917 --> 04:20.125
We're going to be staying here
for a while.

04:22.292 --> 04:25.333

'Captain, over here.'

04:42.750 --> 04:45.167
- 'Any progress?'
- 'We found two more bodies.'

04:45.250 --> 04:46.750
That's four dead so far.

04:46.833 --> 04:48.042
Doc thinks there may still be

04:48.125 --> 04:49.167
some live ones
buried in the rubble

04:49.250 --> 04:51.000
so we're being extra careful.

04:51.083 --> 04:53.083
She didn't see anything.

04:53.167 --> 04:54.375
Said she was just walking
past the hall

04:54.458 --> 04:55.875
when all hell broke loose.

04:55.958 --> 04:57.375
You got any idea what happened?

04:57.458 --> 04:59.708
No, not yet, place is full
of old pipe and junk

04:59.792 --> 05:01.000
wires been messed with.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.625
Any number of things
could've gone wrong.

05:02.708 --> 05:04.208
So, you're ruling out a bombing?

05:04.292 --> 05:06.292
After what we've been through
lately. Not a chance.

05:06.375 --> 05:08.208
Now, the thing is nine times
outta ten you got a bomb

05:08.292 --> 05:09.583
you got a political statement.

05:09.667 --> 05:11.458
There's nothing down here
worth blowing up.

05:11.542 --> 05:13.792
Should know a little more when
forensic team gets through.

05:13.875 --> 05:15.333
Alright, keep digging.

05:15.417 --> 05:17.542
Let me know as soon as
you find anything.

05:17.625 --> 05:19.167
Alright.

05:28.458 --> 05:30.708
I'm sorry, I'm late.
We've had a bit of a problem.

05:30.792 --> 05:32.500
Oh, yes, I heard.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.750
- Is there anything we can do?
- No.

05:34.833 --> 05:37.625
Not at this time.
But thank you. Please.

05:38.667 --> 05:41.125
So, I take it
you're Brother Theo.

05:41.208 --> 05:46.167
Yes, my brothers and I are
from New Mallory back home.

05:46.250 --> 05:47.958
We have applied to Earthdome

05:48.042 --> 05:51.583
for permanent resident status
on Babylon 5.

05:51.667 --> 05:53.417
The documents and permissions

05:53.500 --> 05:56.250
from Archbishop Francis
are all right there.

05:56.333 --> 05:59.083
- You wanna live here?
- Yes.

05:59.167 --> 06:02.583
Is that so extraordinary?
You live here, after all.

06:02.667 --> 06:03.958
I'm stationed here.

06:04.042 --> 06:06.292
Just about everyone
who lives here works here.

06:06.375 --> 06:07.917
The dockers, the shop owners

06:08.000 --> 06:09.625
environmental specialists
that sorta thing.

06:09.708 --> 06:11.417
The rest are just
short-term visitors.

06:11.500 --> 06:12.583
- Businessmen--
- Yes, yes.

06:12.667 --> 06:15.417
We've studied Babylon 5
very carefully.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.292
It's perfect for our needs.

06:18.375 --> 06:21.542
- Which are..
- To learn.

06:21.625 --> 06:23.208
And to teach.

06:23.292 --> 06:26.125
The Bible says
that even the smallest sparrow

06:26.208 --> 06:29.500
does not fall
without God seeing it.

06:29.583 --> 06:33.083
What then of all these other
races on distant worlds?

06:33.167 --> 06:35.292
Would he abandon them?

06:35.375 --> 06:38.167
Or reveal himself
in some other way?

06:38.250 --> 06:40.667
God goes by many names.

06:40.750 --> 06:42.542
'Perhaps some are
alien-sounding'

06:42.625 --> 06:44.125
'different faces and history'

06:44.208 --> 06:48.292
but all describing
the same creator.

06:48.375 --> 06:52.458
We've come here
to learn all those names.

06:52.542 --> 06:54.292
In hopes of better
understanding

06:54.375 --> 06:56.917
the one who is behind them.

06:58.083 --> 07:00.167
Well, that's fine, but..

07:00.250 --> 07:01.708
Why here?

07:01.792 --> 07:05.417
To visit all the other worlds
would take centuries.

07:05.500 --> 07:08.250
With all the aliens
who come through Babylon 5

07:08.333 --> 07:12.250
we can accomplish our task
in four or five decades.

07:12.333 --> 07:15.250
Oh, we are used
to being patient.

07:15.333 --> 07:17.333
Whether it's illuminating
manuscripts

07:17.417 --> 07:21.167
or programming
a system analysis

07:21.250 --> 07:24.292
our work has always
been very detailed.

07:25.792 --> 07:28.375
Brother Theo,
I understand the idea

07:28.458 --> 07:30.250
but we really don't want
the aliens

07:30.333 --> 07:31.917
that come through here
being harassed.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.667
Well, that is not our intent.

07:33.750 --> 07:35.333
We'll simply be here

07:35.417 --> 07:38.000
for those who wish
to talk and to listen.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.208
We don't have a lotta space.

07:39.292 --> 07:42.375
We'll live in
what you call Downbelow.

07:42.458 --> 07:44.333
We can pay for modest rooms.

07:44.417 --> 07:46.375
We're not used to
fancy accommodations

07:46.458 --> 07:47.625
a cot, a table.

07:47.708 --> 07:48.917
I'm gonna have
a hard time justif--

07:49.000 --> 07:51.375
We're prepared
to earn our keep

07:51.458 --> 07:54.708
by providing services to others.

07:54.792 --> 07:57.375
I've chosen
my companions carefully.

07:57.458 --> 07:59.750
They're highly
sought-after experts

07:59.833 --> 08:02.250
in computer research biogenetics

08:02.333 --> 08:04.167
physics, chemistry,
engineering--

08:04.250 --> 08:07.042
With all do respect, if these
people are so much in demand

08:07.125 --> 08:08.792
why are they involved with this

08:08.875 --> 08:11.583
spiritual exchange program
of yours?

08:11.667 --> 08:14.458
They also believe.

08:15.500 --> 08:18.583
[instrumental music]

08:23.833 --> 08:26.292
Morishi, come here.

08:32.792 --> 08:34.167
Check this out.

08:34.250 --> 08:35.500
From the pattern
of the debris I'd say

08:35.583 --> 08:37.292
this was the center point
for the blast.

08:37.375 --> 08:40.583
Looks like it. Scoring on the
wall indicates tremendous force.

08:40.667 --> 08:42.417
Yeah, we haven't been able to
find anything around here

08:42.500 --> 08:44.667
that could've caused
this naturally.

08:44.750 --> 08:47.083
- Bomb?
- Bomb.

08:47.167 --> 08:50.458
There goes my vacation.
One week off in three years.

08:50.542 --> 08:53.958
Whoever's behind this
has really honked me off now.

08:54.042 --> 08:55.042
Okay, listen up.

08:55.125 --> 08:56.458
I want this all area sealed off

08:56.542 --> 08:58.000
security personnel only.

08:58.083 --> 09:01.083
Tell the environmental
cleanup crew that they can wait.

09:01.167 --> 09:03.000
Do what you can
to reconstruct this thing.

09:03.083 --> 09:05.292
- Will do.
- Good, I'll tell the captain.

09:05.375 --> 09:07.333
He ain't going to like this.

09:08.875 --> 09:10.958

"Sheila, I says'

09:11.042 --> 09:13.000

channel once more time'

09:13.083 --> 09:15.292
and I'm out of here,
you got it?"

09:15.375 --> 09:18.292
Well, she did, I did,
and here I am.

09:18.375 --> 09:20.000
You should've seen
the look on her face.

09:20.083 --> 09:21.458
Let me tell you.

09:21.542 --> 09:23.833
But, it's great, I get to
meet all kinds of people.

09:23.917 --> 09:26.917
I mean, look me sitting
next to you a Minbari.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.750
You know,
us and that war and all.

09:29.833 --> 09:32.208
But, uh, I don't hold a grudge.
No, sir.

09:32.292 --> 09:35.125
You know, I say
live and let live.

09:35.208 --> 09:39.208
You know, look, I got hair.
You got a bone.

09:39.292 --> 09:41.333
[laughing]

09:43.458 --> 09:46.292
So, where you going?

09:46.375 --> 09:50.333
Home. I have been diagnosed
with Netar's Syndrome.

09:50.417 --> 09:52.875
Since I have only
seven days to live

09:52.958 --> 09:54.333
I thought
I would return home

09:54.417 --> 09:57.708
to put my affairs in order
before the end.

09:58.583 --> 10:00.083
Netar's Syndrome?

10:00.167 --> 10:01.292
I've, I've had a few syndromes

10:01.375 --> 10:03.000
but I've, I've never
heard of that one.

10:03.083 --> 10:04.417
Neither had I.

10:04.500 --> 10:08.542
Apparently, it's passed
by physical contact.

10:11.417 --> 10:14.875
Uh, I got to make a call.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.125
[sighs]
I will do penance later.

Come on, take it out.'

11:20.000 --> 11:23.708
Tell medlab we're coming in.
Let's move now! Come on.

11:23.792 --> 11:25.292
Doctor, how is he?

11:25.375 --> 11:26.750
We won't know
until we get him into medlab.

11:26.833 --> 11:27.833
He was hit pretty badly.

11:27.917 --> 11:29.167
You will give him
the best of care.

11:29.250 --> 11:31.250
He saved my life,
he could've gone through

11:31.333 --> 11:32.750
and saved himself,
but he waited for me.

11:32.833 --> 11:34.083
Look, we'll do everything
we can, alright?

11:34.167 --> 11:37.167
- Doctor.. Please.
- No, move!

11:37.250 --> 11:39.083
(Garibaldi)
We've established that
the same type of device

11:39.167 --> 11:40.583
was used in both explosions.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.750
'Now, there aren't any
significant structures'

11:42.833 --> 11:44.625
'I'd consider targets
in either area.'

11:44.708 --> 11:46.208
But they're both heavily
trafficked areas

11:46.292 --> 11:48.292
which confirms
what I've been afraid of.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.042
The bombings are targeting
people, plain and simple.

11:51.125 --> 11:52.792
Our tests indicate
that the bomb

11:52.875 --> 11:56.208
contained a highly explosive
form of iridium nitrate

11:56.292 --> 11:59.042
concentrated explosive
similar to plastique.

11:59.125 --> 12:01.542
It's available through several
commercial manufacturers.

12:01.625 --> 12:03.458
All commercial explosives
have a molecular code

12:03.542 --> 12:06.333
that let's you backtrack. Where
it came from? Who bought it?

12:06.417 --> 12:08.000
We're analyzing it now
to try and trace it.

12:08.083 --> 12:10.083
Any chance this is Home Guard
or Free Mars?

12:10.167 --> 12:11.667
(Garibaldi)
'Yeah, there's always
that chance.'

12:11.750 --> 12:13.292
I've got Earth Central
putting together a list

12:13.375 --> 12:15.167
of terrorists groups
that might be expanding

12:15.250 --> 12:19.333
their range of operations,
but my gut says that ain't it.

12:20.042 --> 12:21.125
Medical?

12:21.208 --> 12:23.000
We now have a total of
seven dead

12:23.083 --> 12:25.917
and nineteen injured
including Mr. Lennier.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.417
'news of the attacks just spread
all over the station.'

12:28.500 --> 12:31.000
People are scared
out of their wits.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.417
The sheer randomness of it.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.042
How do you get on
with your life not knowing

12:34.125 --> 12:36.167
when or where the next blast
is gonna come.

12:36.250 --> 12:38.333
Which fits in with
what I told Garibaldi earlier.

12:38.417 --> 12:40.500
We received several
anonymous calls at C&amp;C

12:40.583 --> 12:42.292
just before the first explosion.

12:42.375 --> 12:43.833
All they said was,
"Chaos is coming."

12:43.917 --> 12:46.833
Yeah, well, we've got
plenty of that, alright.

12:46.917 --> 12:49.000
So, we will assume that
there is a connection

12:49.083 --> 12:51.667
until we hear otherwise.

12:51.750 --> 12:54.667
As of right now,
this is our number one priority.

12:54.750 --> 12:58.458
Do whatever you have to do
but I want this stopped.

12:58.542 --> 13:00.625
Until this is over
I want halls cleared

13:00.708 --> 13:02.583
of groups larger than ten.

13:02.667 --> 13:05.042
There's no point
in providing easy targets.

13:05.125 --> 13:09.292
Unidentified packages will
be confiscated and scanned.

13:09.375 --> 13:11.333
Anyone found
in a restricted area

13:11.417 --> 13:12.875
without proper authorization

13:13.000 --> 13:15.792
will be taken in
for questioning.

13:15.875 --> 13:17.708
Now, whoever's responsible

13:17.792 --> 13:20.917
I want them found
and found fast.

13:24.333 --> 13:28.042
(Delenn)
'Do you have any idea how long
he'll remain unconscious?'

13:28.125 --> 13:29.583
Not yet.

13:29.667 --> 13:31.792
He was hit pretty hard.

13:31.875 --> 13:35.833
Hairline fracture of skull
and shoulder, concussion.

13:35.917 --> 13:37.083
The only thing
that saved his life

13:37.167 --> 13:38.375
was the external
bone structure

13:38.458 --> 13:40.625
covering the interior lobe.

13:40.708 --> 13:42.625
All we can do now is wait.

13:42.708 --> 13:45.708
What kind of monster
would do such a thing?

13:45.792 --> 13:48.458
To do all this without reason?

13:48.542 --> 13:50.333
[beeping]

13:50.417 --> 13:51.875
- Franklin.
- 'Ivanova here.'

13:51.958 --> 13:54.417
- 'Is Delenn there?'
- Right here.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.250
'Ambassador, the next of kin
of some of the Minbari'

13:57.333 --> 13:59.375
'killed in the explosion
are waiting for you.'

13:59.458 --> 14:02.417
Thank you, commander.
We'll be right there.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.708
You will keep me informed
of his condition?

14:04.792 --> 14:07.583
I'll let you know
the second anything changes.

14:11.167 --> 14:12.500
(G'Kar)
It's obvious the Centauri

14:12.583 --> 14:14.292
are the ones
planting these bombs.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.292
G'Kar, we are
considering all leads.

14:16.375 --> 14:18.208
But saying it
doesn't make it so.

14:18.292 --> 14:19.250
You don't have any evidence.

14:19.333 --> 14:20.708
The explosion that almost killed

14:20.792 --> 14:22.292
your captain
was caused by a Centauri.

14:22.375 --> 14:24.792
That was an isolated incident
and there's no reason to believe

14:24.875 --> 14:26.250
it had anything to do with this.

14:26.333 --> 14:27.958
Oh, no, no.
Of course not.

14:28.042 --> 14:31.083
Uh, I suppose we've had
a convention of mad bombers

14:31.167 --> 14:33.583
arrive here at the station.
Yes, that must be it.

14:33.667 --> 14:35.292
From now on
I must remember to check

14:35.375 --> 14:37.292
the Babylon 5
social calendar more often.

14:37.375 --> 14:38.458
G'Kar..

14:38.542 --> 14:40.708
This is obviously
the beginning of a campaign

14:40.792 --> 14:42.292
of terror by the Centauri.

14:42.375 --> 14:45.125
Several Narns have been killed
in these recent explosions.

14:45.208 --> 14:46.542
And so have two Centauri.

14:46.625 --> 14:48.792
Oh, a Narn ship
had just arrived.

14:48.875 --> 14:50.667
And a Centauri ship was leaving.

14:50.750 --> 14:51.792
There! You see!

14:51.875 --> 14:54.458
Their rage against us
is so irrational

14:54.542 --> 14:56.625
that they'll sacrifice
their own people

14:56.708 --> 14:58.542
to get to us, don't you see?

14:58.625 --> 15:00.875
It is perfectly
obvious to anyone

15:00.958 --> 15:03.917
that the Narns are responsible
for these atrocities.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.292
There have been similar
incidents of terror

15:06.375 --> 15:07.792
back on their Home World

15:07.875 --> 15:09.958
directed against our forces
of liberation.

15:10.042 --> 15:11.667
This is one of the few places
they can gather

15:11.750 --> 15:13.542
freely, ambassador.
Why would they wanna damage it?

15:13.625 --> 15:16.208
But they are an irrational
people, captain.

15:16.292 --> 15:17.417
I've told you that before.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.542
Now, that Earth
has wisely signed

15:19.625 --> 15:21.500
a non-aggression treaty
with my government

15:21.583 --> 15:24.458
it's only natural
that they begin do to you

15:24.542 --> 15:27.167
'what they have been
doing to us all this time.'

15:27.250 --> 15:30.333
Now you see what we have been
going through? Yes?

15:30.417 --> 15:31.958
At this stage,
I think it's a little early

15:32.042 --> 15:34.083
to start pointing fingers.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.958
'And I would hate to think'

15:36.042 --> 15:39.625
that anyone would try to use
this tragic situation

15:39.708 --> 15:42.667
to their own
political advantage.

15:44.083 --> 15:46.917
There's nothing political
about the truth, captain

15:47.000 --> 15:50.042
as you will discover
soon enough.

15:55.583 --> 15:57.625
- How is it out there?
- 'Bad.'

15:57.708 --> 15:59.292
People are afraid
to leave their quarters.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.958
There's no telling where the
next bombing is going to happen.

16:02.042 --> 16:04.667
There's no pattern to it. No
one's claiming responsibility.

16:04.750 --> 16:06.875
It just doesn't make any sense.

16:06.958 --> 16:09.625
Not to us, no,
but to whoever is doing it

16:09.708 --> 16:12.417
it sure makes sense.

16:12.500 --> 16:15.208
You know, Garibaldi was right
when he said

16:15.292 --> 16:16.917
"When you've got a bomb,
nine times out of ten

16:17.000 --> 16:19.875
someone's trying to send
you a message."

16:19.958 --> 16:21.542
Now, what we've got to do
is figured out

16:21.625 --> 16:24.417
what the message means..

16:24.500 --> 16:27.042
...and who's trying to send it.

16:28.875 --> 16:30.958
Well, I'm not sure
you should be here.

16:31.042 --> 16:33.333
Well, of course, I should.

16:33.417 --> 16:35.958
Dr. Franklin
has given his approval.

16:36.042 --> 16:38.875
Do you know that sometimes
talking to someone

16:38.958 --> 16:40.583
who has been injured like this

16:40.667 --> 16:43.458
can help them to,
to come around?

16:43.542 --> 16:46.417
Oh, I can't help everything else
that is going on.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.250
But talking..

16:48.333 --> 16:50.250
...that I can do.

16:50.333 --> 16:54.083
Alright.
I'll check back later.

16:58.375 --> 17:01.917
Hey!
Try not to touch anything.

17:12.167 --> 17:13.750
[sighs]

17:13.833 --> 17:16.375
It is a strange thing, Lennier.

17:16.458 --> 17:18.750
As I think of it, I realize

17:18.833 --> 17:22.500
no one has ever
saved my life before.

17:23.875 --> 17:27.292
Thank you for that.

17:27.375 --> 17:31.583
And so, here I am.
It is the least I can do.

17:31.667 --> 17:33.125
If I were in your position

17:33.208 --> 17:36.667
I am sure that you would
do the same for me.

17:39.167 --> 17:41.375
Of course,
if, if I were in your position

17:41.458 --> 17:44.542
and you were still
in your position

17:44.625 --> 17:48.958
neither one of us could
do very much for the other.

17:49.042 --> 17:52.708
So, I suppose,
properly, I should say that

17:52.792 --> 17:56.375
if I were in your position
and you were in my position

17:56.458 --> 17:58.833
you would do the same.

18:00.167 --> 18:02.083
Of course, if both of us
were in my position

18:02.167 --> 18:05.708
and neither of us
were in your position

18:05.792 --> 18:11.042
there would not be the need
for anyone to do...anything.

18:15.500 --> 18:17.167
I'm not sure that
actually made sense

18:17.250 --> 18:20.667
but I'm afraid that
if I try to go back

18:20.750 --> 18:25.167
and figure it out I will start
bleeding from my ears.

18:37.792 --> 18:39.833
[chuckling]

18:42.500 --> 18:44.375
I heard a joke today.

18:44.458 --> 18:48.042
I probably should not
repeat it, but, uh..

18:48.125 --> 18:50.417
Who are you going to tell, hm?

18:52.125 --> 18:55.167
How many Centauri
does it take too, uh

18:55.250 --> 18:58.083
screw in a light bulb?

18:59.458 --> 19:00.875
Just one.

19:00.958 --> 19:04.125
But in the great old days
of the republic

19:04.208 --> 19:05.875
hundreds of servants

19:05.958 --> 19:07.958
would change
a thousand light bulbs

19:08.042 --> 19:10.208
at the slightest whim.

19:10.292 --> 19:12.292
[laughing]

19:15.458 --> 19:17.792
Oh, well..

19:17.875 --> 19:20.625
[sighs]
I guess you had to be there.

19:24.083 --> 19:28.167
I'm going to take a break now
and wait for you to talk.

19:28.958 --> 19:30.750
And if you don't

19:30.833 --> 19:33.542
I will just start talking again.

19:34.833 --> 19:37.750
And we wouldn't want that now,
would we?

19:43.625 --> 19:45.750
Take your time.

19:45.833 --> 19:48.000
No pressure.

19:52.417 --> 19:54.583
I'll wait.

19:57.917 --> 20:00.000
We just had another hit
this time in Brown 7.

20:00.083 --> 20:01.917
- Fatalities?
- No, we got lucky.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.917
One of my team found the bomb
seconds before it went off.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.458
We were able to
clear the place out.

20:05.542 --> 20:07.083
A couple of small injuries,
nothing major.

20:07.167 --> 20:08.375
Were you able
to find out anything

20:08.458 --> 20:09.792
about the bomb
before it went off?

20:09.875 --> 20:11.458
Not much.
It looked pretty primitive.

20:11.542 --> 20:13.000
So, I don't think
we're dealing with a pro.

20:13.083 --> 20:15.125
The question is why?
What's in it for him?

20:15.208 --> 20:16.500
You know I've been
thinking about that?

20:16.583 --> 20:18.375
We've been looking
for political agendas.

20:18.458 --> 20:21.000
So far all of his targets
have been general.

20:21.083 --> 20:23.125
He's been striking out
at people randomly.

20:23.208 --> 20:25.250
Yeah, and he's got
everybody terrified.

20:25.333 --> 20:27.625
Maybe that's what he wants.
Create fear.

20:27.708 --> 20:30.417
- Maybe that's the message.
- 'Chief, you there?'

20:30.500 --> 20:32.208
Yeah, right here Morishi.
What's up?

20:32.292 --> 20:35.458
We just finished our analysis on
what was left of the explosives.

20:35.542 --> 20:38.292
Molecular coding was in tact
on enough of it to get a trace.

20:38.375 --> 20:39.958
So, where'd the stuff
come from?

20:40.042 --> 20:44.375
Seems it was stolen from a ice
mining operation on Vega 7.

20:44.458 --> 20:45.500
When we dug into it

20:45.583 --> 20:47.583
we found out
the same batch of explosives

20:47.667 --> 20:51.125
were used in a series of bombs
on Proxima 3.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.167
Little creep gets around.

20:53.250 --> 20:54.833
Thanks, Morishi.
I'll get back to you.

20:54.917 --> 20:56.583
Run a check on all the ships
that have come in

20:56.667 --> 20:58.500
from Proxima 3
in the last two weeks.

20:58.583 --> 21:01.417
I want passenger manifests,
cargo, everything.

21:01.500 --> 21:02.625
And run the names
against station records

21:02.708 --> 21:04.125
and see who's still here.

21:04.208 --> 21:05.917
- You'll have it in an hour.
- 'One more thing.'

21:06.000 --> 21:07.667
If whoever's behind
these bombings

21:07.750 --> 21:09.167
wants to create fear and chaos

21:09.250 --> 21:10.667
he might just be
sticking around afterwards

21:10.750 --> 21:12.042
to see the results first hand.

21:12.125 --> 21:13.417
That's a good thought.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.125
We should go over
the security camera records

21:15.208 --> 21:17.333
for a period of two or three
hours after the bombings

21:17.417 --> 21:19.667
see if there's the same face
more than once.

21:19.750 --> 21:22.000
Uh, captain, you're talking
of a hell of a lot of video.

21:22.083 --> 21:23.333
We sent in ten extra recorders

21:23.417 --> 21:24.917
in each blast site
to help find survivors.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.833
- And monitor the damage.
- Use a computer.

21:26.917 --> 21:28.667
Well, you're still gonna have to
give the system some parameters.

21:28.750 --> 21:30.333
I mean, we've got partial faces,
backs of heads.

21:30.417 --> 21:32.167
'You cant just tell it
to search all the recordings'

21:32.250 --> 21:33.667
and look for the same face.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.125
We're talking
pure human instinct.

21:35.208 --> 21:37.875
- We've gotta be detailed--
- Chief. Chief.

21:37.958 --> 21:41.083
I think I know just the people.
Come with me.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.792
Excuse me.

21:58.792 --> 22:00.875
What is the time?

22:00.958 --> 22:02.708
16:00 hours.

22:03.458 --> 22:05.292
Thank you.

22:10.708 --> 22:13.375
I have an errand
to take care of.

22:14.458 --> 22:17.250
I will be back soon.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.417
So, what we needed to do is
go over all the footage

22:23.500 --> 22:25.625
taken after the bombings,
and see if anyone appears

22:25.708 --> 22:27.583
in more than one.
It's not going to be very easy.

22:27.667 --> 22:29.000
You've got people
going and coming and--

22:29.083 --> 22:31.875
- That's all then?
- Well, yes, then--

22:31.958 --> 22:34.375
We'll call you
as soon as we have him.

22:34.458 --> 22:36.250
Good day.

22:43.625 --> 22:45.000
May I be the first to say

22:45.083 --> 22:48.542
that this is the nuttiest idea
you've ever had?

22:48.625 --> 22:50.833

[door opens]

23:15.667 --> 23:19.083
Never mind.
I'll wait for the next one.

[indistinct chatter]

- 'We don't know.'

24:16.708 --> 24:18.292
(Stephen)
'Explosion blew out
most of Red 15.'

24:18.375 --> 24:19.792
'We can't even get down there.'

24:19.875 --> 24:21.542
'We think there might be ten,
maybe twenty people'

24:21.625 --> 24:22.875
'still left in the hallway.'

24:22.958 --> 24:24.625
'Three transport tubes
are down.'

24:24.708 --> 24:28.417
- Anyone still inside?
- Unknown.

Green 2!

25:14.208 --> 25:16.208
[gasps]

25:20.167 --> 25:22.083
Hello?

25:23.625 --> 25:26.167
Is there anyone out there?

25:29.000 --> 25:31.708
Can anyone hear me?

25:43.000 --> 25:46.042
There's no one there.

25:46.125 --> 25:50.000
It would appear that
we are on our own.

25:53.042 --> 25:56.167
I-I don't know how long
I have been unconscious.

25:56.250 --> 25:58.708
Two standard hours.

26:00.208 --> 26:02.208
Two hours?

26:03.083 --> 26:06.375
'And you have done nothing?'

26:06.458 --> 26:10.792
I will point out to you
that this door is extremely hot!

26:10.875 --> 26:14.250
There is a very good chance
there is a fire out there

26:14.333 --> 26:16.583
and even if the fire
doesn't get in here

26:16.667 --> 26:18.417
the smoke and heat

26:18.500 --> 26:21.417
will eventually make it
impossible to breath

26:21.500 --> 26:24.792
and we will die in here.

26:24.875 --> 26:26.917
[chuckling]

26:30.125 --> 26:33.417
With enough effort we can
probably force our way

26:33.500 --> 26:35.042
through the ceiling.

26:35.125 --> 26:37.875
[chuckling]

26:37.958 --> 26:41.333
Perhaps I have not made myself
sufficiently clear.

26:41.417 --> 26:45.167
There is no telling
when help will come.

26:45.250 --> 26:49.083
Unless we get ourselves
out of here on our own

26:49.167 --> 26:51.208
we'll probably die here.

26:51.292 --> 26:52.292
[chuckling]

26:52.375 --> 26:55.000
'So we must work together!'

26:55.083 --> 26:56.500
No.

26:56.583 --> 26:58.000
No?

26:58.917 --> 27:01.750
- What do you mean, no?
- No.

27:01.833 --> 27:03.833
[laughing]

27:03.917 --> 27:05.833
Do you want to live
as much as I, hmm?

27:05.917 --> 27:07.375
Oh-oh, yes, but

27:07.458 --> 27:10.958
I would much
rather see you dead.

27:13.750 --> 27:14.958
I see.

27:15.042 --> 27:17.417
Well, here I am.
Come on, kill me.

27:17.500 --> 27:18.833
Come kill me!

27:18.917 --> 27:21.917
You forget the terms
of our surrender.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.375
The penalty for the killing
of any Centauri by any Narn

27:26.458 --> 27:28.708
will be the death of 500 Narns

27:28.792 --> 27:32.000
including the perpetrator's
own family!

27:32.958 --> 27:35.208
But I don't have to kill you.

27:36.167 --> 27:38.458
I don't have to do anything

27:38.542 --> 27:41.375
and I still get to
watch you die.

27:42.417 --> 27:44.833
I find this most appealing.

27:45.958 --> 27:48.083
This is insane!

27:48.167 --> 27:50.083
We must work together!

27:50.167 --> 27:52.917
No, as the humans say

27:53.000 --> 27:54.333
"Up yours, die."

27:54.417 --> 27:56.583
[laughing]

27:56.667 --> 27:58.792
I don't believe it.

[laughing]

28:03.125 --> 28:05.583
You are mad!
You know that?

28:07.125 --> 28:09.792
We're in here!

28:09.875 --> 28:12.083
- Can anyone hear us?
- I hear you.

28:12.167 --> 28:14.167
[laughing]

28:15.292 --> 28:18.458
- In here!
- We're in here.

we got all hell

28:27.500 --> 28:28.792
That one.

28:28.875 --> 28:31.917
We found him at the site
of every explosion.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.917
Just watching.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.667
Are you sure about this?

28:37.708 --> 28:39.250
Okay.

28:39.333 --> 28:41.583
Let's cross-reference his face
against the passenger manifest

ships from Proxima 3

According to his personnel file
he's a loner, quiet guy.

29:52.292 --> 29:54.042
Save me from loners
and quiet guys.

29:54.125 --> 29:55.708
Yeah, but a real bad temper,
now, he's got several

29:55.792 --> 29:58.167
disciplinary notes in his jacket
and according to his supervisor

29:58.250 --> 30:00.000
he hasn't been able to keep
his mind on his job.

you can't get out of here

- What're you doing?
- You heard him.

stick it inside your shirt

Well, where do you suggest
I put it?

we'll be able to tell

what you had for lunch.

Great.

31:27.375 --> 31:29.375
Alright, you find that bomb,
Michael.

31:29.458 --> 31:32.625
We will. Just don't do
anything stupid.

31:33.833 --> 31:35.625
Too late.

31:40.750 --> 31:43.167
- Garibaldi to C&amp;C.
- 'C&amp;C online.'

31:43.250 --> 31:45.625
I've opened the captain's link.
Receive only, max volume.

31:45.708 --> 31:47.667
And you get me secure link
to Morishi and the bomb squad

31:47.750 --> 31:48.917
and whatever the hell you do

31:49.000 --> 31:50.625
you don't let anyone
page the captain.

we could talk privately.'

You satisfied?

32:36.375 --> 32:37.875
For now.

32:40.083 --> 32:41.208
Where's the bomb?

32:41.292 --> 32:42.917
Somewhere you'll never find it.

32:43.000 --> 32:47.458
As long as the trigger
keeps transmitting no boom.

32:47.542 --> 32:50.750
- But if it stops..
- I understand.

32:50.833 --> 32:52.208
Now, what do you want?

32:52.292 --> 32:55.000
I want you to get me
out of here, Sheridan.

32:55.083 --> 32:57.458
You're going to
escort me to a ship.

32:57.542 --> 32:59.125
And then
I'm going to leave here.

32:59.208 --> 33:01.583
You got to know
we can't do that.

33:01.667 --> 33:03.333
'Yes, you can.'

33:03.417 --> 33:06.542
Because if you don't
I'll let this go

33:06.625 --> 33:09.042
and this whole place
will go up in an explosion

33:09.125 --> 33:12.375
as bright as the sun.

33:12.458 --> 33:14.250

and you're gonna die'

33:15.875 --> 33:18.125
You arrest me,
I'm dead already.

33:18.208 --> 33:21.708
The way I see it
I've got nothing to lose.

33:21.792 --> 33:24.500
And you've got
everything to lose.

33:26.167 --> 33:28.792
- Garibaldi here. Morishi?
- 'Standing by.'

33:28.875 --> 33:30.458
Alright, listen the guy
just said something about

33:30.542 --> 33:32.292
an explosion bright as the sun,
but his stuff he's got

33:32.375 --> 33:35.375
isn't capable of anything
that big. I got a hunch.

33:35.458 --> 33:37.917
Scramble a Zero-G team and check
out the fusion reactor.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.250
If he worked maintenance
in engineering.

33:39.333 --> 33:42.458
- He might've had access.
- 'Will do.'

33:42.542 --> 33:45.167

'Okay, let's say
I give you what you want.'

33:45.250 --> 33:47.917
'It's going to take time.'

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
Now, that hand of yours
is going to get tired

33:51.083 --> 33:53.500
holding that remote.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.708
So why don't we just settle this
between us, huh?

33:57.792 --> 33:59.333
You got me.

33:59.417 --> 34:01.667
Security is not going to open
the fire if I am a hostage

34:01.750 --> 34:03.542
so why bring
other people into it?

34:03.625 --> 34:06.167
Why not?

34:08.167 --> 34:10.500
I suffered.
Why shouldn't they?

34:10.583 --> 34:13.208
Because they didn't do
anything to you.

34:13.292 --> 34:14.542
They're an audience.

34:14.625 --> 34:18.708
And what good is an artist
without an audience?

34:20.292 --> 34:23.667
- What're you saying?
- Now, look around!

34:23.750 --> 34:27.625
These are chaotic times,
captain!

34:27.708 --> 34:31.125
I'm simply
an instrument of my time.

34:31.208 --> 34:34.125
People need to understand fear.

34:36.083 --> 34:38.583
Do you understand fear?

34:43.167 --> 34:45.167
Do you?

34:48.250 --> 34:49.917
[gunshot]

34:50.000 --> 34:51.917
No, wait!

34:52.000 --> 34:54.500
Won't kill his audience.
Not yet.

34:54.583 --> 34:59.042
(Robert)
'Yes, I see you do.'

34:59.125 --> 35:02.417
'You know,
back home I was no one.'

35:02.500 --> 35:04.417
'Nothing.'

35:04.500 --> 35:06.583
My wife walked out on me.

35:06.667 --> 35:09.042
I lost my job, my apartment.

35:09.125 --> 35:11.167
Couldn't pay the bills.

35:11.250 --> 35:14.333
People walked all over me
because they could

35:14.417 --> 35:19.125
because they like it
when you are afraid.

35:19.208 --> 35:22.292
So now it's my turn.

35:22.375 --> 35:24.792
When I was fired,
when they took away my apartment

35:24.875 --> 35:28.542
they all said,
it's nothing personal.

35:28.625 --> 35:31.417
It's just the times.

35:31.500 --> 35:34.833
Well, it's nothing personal,
cap'n.

35:35.792 --> 35:37.875
It's just the times.

35:42.333 --> 35:45.208

'Opening hatch. Going in.'

'Anybody back there got any
ideas where the bomb might be?'

(male #5)
'We've got an awful
lot of ground to cover here.'

35:49.792 --> 35:52.833
(Garibaldi)
'Not yet, keep looking.
Scanners at maximum.'

35:52.917 --> 35:55.208
(Robert)
'I'm not gonna ask you again.'

35:55.292 --> 35:59.792
Get on that damn line
and get me a ship!

35:59.875 --> 36:01.333
You seem awfully nervous
for someone

36:01.417 --> 36:03.792
who is so prepared to die.

36:04.917 --> 36:07.375
I tell you what.

36:07.458 --> 36:09.083
I'll make you a deal.

36:09.167 --> 36:12.417
You tell me where that bomb is
I will get you that ship.

36:14.083 --> 36:15.542
Not a chance.

36:15.625 --> 36:17.917
Well, then why should I
cooperate?

36:18.000 --> 36:21.167
I mean, how do I know
there even is another bomb?

36:21.250 --> 36:23.583
There is, trust me.

36:23.667 --> 36:26.125
It's there.

36:26.208 --> 36:29.250
[dramatic music]

36:36.375 --> 36:38.250
I got something.

36:39.500 --> 36:40.792
Oh, man, this thing
is big enough

36:40.875 --> 36:42.750
to blow straight through
the reactor core.

36:42.833 --> 36:44.833
Alright, can you see
any wires or panels?

36:44.917 --> 36:48.208
'Negative, the whole thing
is welded shut.'

36:48.292 --> 36:50.000
Okay, You're gonna have to try
and move it out of there.

36:50.083 --> 36:51.958
This guy isn't a pro
so he probably didn't it setup

36:52.042 --> 36:54.042
with any vibration detectors.

36:54.125 --> 36:57.250
Probably hoping we wouldn't
find it until it was too late.

36:57.333 --> 37:00.250
- 'You're sure about that?'
- Hell, no.

37:00.333 --> 37:01.542
'But we're running
out of options here.'

37:01.625 --> 37:04.458
'Okay, let's see
what we can do.'

37:09.333 --> 37:11.625
Carlson,
this isn't going to work.

37:12.917 --> 37:14.583
Look, even if you
do get off-station

37:14.667 --> 37:18.000
you really think you're gonna
get away with this?

37:18.083 --> 37:20.208
We've got your ID
flagged to every Earth base

37:20.292 --> 37:21.917
for 30 light years
in every direction.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.458
There's nowhere you can go.

37:23.542 --> 37:25.333
That's enough!

37:26.458 --> 37:28.458
Sit down,
you're making me nervous.

37:28.542 --> 37:32.292
- I'd rather stand.
- I said sit down!

37:37.125 --> 37:38.667
[beeping]

37:38.750 --> 37:41.708
- What the hell was that?
- Oh, damn, we lost him!

37:41.792 --> 37:43.042
Garibaldi to the TAC team,
we got troubles.

37:43.125 --> 37:45.750
You get that bomb
and you get it out now!

37:45.833 --> 37:48.042
You lied to me.

37:48.125 --> 37:51.208
Just like all the others,
you lied to me!

37:51.292 --> 37:53.083
'Set me up!'

37:53.167 --> 37:55.417
You've had 'em
workin' all this time.

37:55.500 --> 37:57.542
Spying on me.

37:58.500 --> 38:00.500
Well, to hell with you.

38:01.833 --> 38:04.583
- To hell with all of you!
- Yeah!

38:05.750 --> 38:07.750
[grunting]

38:10.292 --> 38:13.333
[intense music]

38:18.833 --> 38:20.875
[grunting]

38:22.250 --> 38:24.292
[shattering]

38:34.292 --> 38:36.333
[whooshing]

38:44.417 --> 38:45.875
See you in hell, captain.

38:45.958 --> 38:48.000
[beeping]

38:51.958 --> 38:53.958
[explosion]

38:54.042 --> 38:57.083
No. It didn't.

38:57.167 --> 38:58.417
It's not fair.

38:58.500 --> 39:00.875
I-it's not fair!

39:05.667 --> 39:07.417
What can I say?

39:07.500 --> 39:10.042
Life's tough sometimes.

39:13.667 --> 39:15.500
[beeping]

39:17.833 --> 39:20.542
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

39:20.625 --> 39:22.292
Alright, pick that creep up
and throw him in the brig.

39:22.375 --> 39:23.833
Be careful,
check out the area in case

39:23.917 --> 39:25.750
he left any surprises behind.

39:25.833 --> 39:28.167
- You found the big one, huh?
- Yeah, just barely.

39:28.250 --> 39:30.583
A few seconds earlier..

39:30.667 --> 39:32.750
- Yeah, everybody else okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

39:32.833 --> 39:34.875
We're still clearing out the
debris from the last explosion.

39:34.958 --> 39:37.000
But, they think
they got everybody out.

39:37.083 --> 39:39.167
[Londo coughing]

39:45.708 --> 39:47.708
[coughing]

40:06.042 --> 40:08.042
Oh, ambassador, I'm sorry.
I didn't see you there.

40:08.125 --> 40:10.292
- I was just going to--
- Yes, yes.

40:10.375 --> 40:12.667
Is there any change?

40:12.750 --> 40:15.333
No, not yet.
Not that I've noticed.

40:15.417 --> 40:18.042
Is there any word?

40:18.125 --> 40:21.375
They caught the bomber
20 minutes ago.

40:21.458 --> 40:23.458
A human.

40:23.542 --> 40:26.750
He will be judged
and punished for his crimes.

40:28.208 --> 40:29.542
Good.

40:29.625 --> 40:31.458
I was hoping
it wasn't a Centauri.

40:31.542 --> 40:32.667
The way things
are going around here

40:32.750 --> 40:34.833
that's the last thing we need.

40:39.083 --> 40:40.958
You know, I, uh..

40:41.042 --> 40:44.208
...heard a joke
a little while ago.

40:44.292 --> 40:47.833
How many Centauri does it take
to screw in a light bulb?

40:47.917 --> 40:50.875
Well, just one,
but in the great old days..

40:50.958 --> 40:53.667
The great old days
of the republic

40:53.750 --> 40:55.792
hundreds of servants would leap

40:55.875 --> 41:00.333
to change a thousand bulbs
at your slightest whim.

41:02.875 --> 41:04.833
Heard it.

41:04.917 --> 41:08.292
- Welcome back.
- Hmm.

41:08.375 --> 41:10.708
How do you feel?

41:10.792 --> 41:13.833
As though a great many
heavy objects

41:13.917 --> 41:16.208
had fallen on me.

41:17.417 --> 41:19.417
But I suspect I will live.

41:19.500 --> 41:22.917
I just spoke with Ambassador
Mollari a little while ago.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.958
He's most grateful
for what you did.

41:26.042 --> 41:29.583
The Centaurum will probably want
to give you a medal for this.

41:30.792 --> 41:33.625
Oh, I should have
stayed in the coma.

41:35.333 --> 41:37.625
Come on, Lennier,
you saved his life.

41:37.708 --> 41:40.042
You deserve
a little recognition.

41:40.125 --> 41:43.458
I did what I did..

41:43.542 --> 41:46.625
...because all life is sacred.

41:47.792 --> 41:50.375
But when the object
of your actions

41:50.458 --> 41:53.167
does not share that belief.

41:56.083 --> 41:57.750
I fear I have
served the present

41:57.833 --> 42:00.083
by sacrificing the future.

42:00.167 --> 42:02.208
[metal clanging]

42:10.042 --> 42:13.250
Hey! In here!
We got two more!

42:13.333 --> 42:15.500
'Aah!'

42:15.583 --> 42:17.667
'Get that spanner
over here fast!'

42:17.750 --> 42:20.875
[chuckles]
There, you see?

42:22.083 --> 42:24.250
I'm going to live.

42:24.333 --> 42:26.542
So it would seem.

42:26.625 --> 42:30.417
Well,
it is an imperfect universe.

42:31.333 --> 42:34.500
- Bastard.
- Monster.

42:34.583 --> 42:37.542
- Fanatic.
- Murderer.

42:37.625 --> 42:39.708
You are insane!

42:39.792 --> 42:42.750
And that is why we'll win.

42:44.167 --> 42:47.625
(Londo)
Go be the ambassador
to Babylon 5, they say.

42:47.708 --> 42:50.875
It will be an easy assignment.

42:50.958 --> 42:53.583
[sighs]
I hate my life.

42:53.667 --> 42:57.000
- So do I.
- Shut up!

43:03.708 --> 43:06.250
[theme music]
