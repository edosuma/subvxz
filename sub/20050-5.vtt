00:17.059 --> 00:18.644
Hey, morning,
dick flowers.

00:18.728 --> 00:20.020
About fucking time.

00:20.104 --> 00:21.480
What?
I can't believe
I called you

00:21.564 --> 00:23.608
after the last bullshit
you fucking pulled on us.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.401
Yeah, well, these
things take time.

00:25.484 --> 00:28.404
And that last thing was
a total misunderstanding.

00:28.487 --> 00:31.532
And because I'm
a stand-up guy,
this one's on me.

00:31.616 --> 00:33.826
Minus, of course, some
small fees, charges for...

00:33.910 --> 00:36.161
things that are totally
beyond my control.

00:36.245 --> 00:38.289
Look, you guys are going
to come out on top here

00:38.372 --> 00:40.708
once we sue the sagging,
grey-haired bags

00:40.792 --> 00:42.460
off these bastards.

00:42.543 --> 00:43.669
You're fucking right,
we're suing them.

00:43.753 --> 00:45.170
This is fucking
ridiculous!

00:45.254 --> 00:47.799
Fellas! How'd you
enjoy your stay?

00:47.882 --> 00:49.341
You're a fucking
arsehole, George.

00:49.425 --> 00:51.552
You know that?
You are an actual
fucking arsehole.

00:51.636 --> 00:53.512
You had no right
to keep us in there
for a week.

00:53.596 --> 00:55.222
You had nothing on us!
That's right.

00:55.306 --> 00:57.224
and that's why
we're having a
class action lawsuit

00:57.308 --> 00:59.143
launched against this
entire department,

00:59.226 --> 01:01.687
and that includes
you, Officer Green.

01:01.771 --> 01:03.272
That's Chief Green,
dick breath.

01:03.355 --> 01:05.524
And before you go around
launching lawsuits,

01:05.608 --> 01:09.361
let me remind you
of those old surveillance
photos we have of you.

01:09.445 --> 01:10.989
Remember that?
The tranny crack whore

01:11.071 --> 01:12.657
doing lines
off your dick?

01:12.740 --> 01:14.993
It'd be a real shame if
those things resurfaced

01:15.075 --> 01:17.829
and bit you in the
ass, wouldn't it?

01:17.912 --> 01:19.330
Okay, well,
you guys are out.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.499
My job's done.
Listen, I've got to run.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.626
Uh, I'll send you the bill.
We'll talk soon. Okay?

01:23.709 --> 01:25.503
What? Wha-wha-wha...
Ba-ba-ba-
ba-ba-ba!

01:25.586 --> 01:27.546
Fucking idiot.

01:27.630 --> 01:28.840
Where his truck?

01:28.923 --> 01:30.299
Impound.

01:30.382 --> 01:31.759
But you can drive
it away right now

01:31.843 --> 01:34.012
for the low sum
of $723.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.347
723 bucks
for one week?

01:36.430 --> 01:38.683
Are you kidding me?
No, that's
the cash price.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.518
You know, service
and towing fees,

01:40.601 --> 01:42.353
storage,
unpaid tickets,

01:42.436 --> 01:44.355
departmental
surcharge.
"Cash price"?

01:44.438 --> 01:46.065
When do you fucking
deal with cash,

01:46.148 --> 01:47.692
you greasy bastard?

01:47.775 --> 01:49.694
I'm sure you'll come
up with the money.

01:49.777 --> 01:52.154
Hope so anyway,
because if it's not
picked up by 5:00,

01:52.237 --> 01:53.698
it's going
to the crusher.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.033
Impound lot's full,

01:55.115 --> 01:57.785
so I bumped it up to
the top of the list.

01:57.869 --> 02:00.705
George, you can't do that,
you crooked son of a whore.

02:00.788 --> 02:03.749
(Chuckles)
Can't I?

02:03.833 --> 02:06.044
It's tough being
this powerful.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.670
It really is.

02:10.965 --> 02:12.633
Abso-fucking-lute
power

02:12.717 --> 02:15.053
corrupts
abso-fucking-lutely!

02:15.135 --> 02:18.389
What a shit-encrusted
dick-helmet!

02:18.472 --> 02:21.934
(Theme music)

03:00.514 --> 03:04.102
(Grunting)

03:04.184 --> 03:06.353
(Chuckling)

03:06.437 --> 03:07.939
Trinity:
He really is
good with him.

03:08.022 --> 03:09.899
Yeah, he really is.
I just...

03:09.982 --> 03:11.776
I hope he doesn't
have an ulterior
motive, you know?

03:11.859 --> 03:14.112
Like, he's fucked
us over so many
times in the past,

03:14.194 --> 03:15.780
it's just hard
to get past that.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.656
It's different
now that he's family.

03:17.740 --> 03:18.950
Yeah, but is it?

03:19.033 --> 03:20.284
I wouldn't trust him.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.870
I just want Mo to be
happy, and he is.

03:22.954 --> 03:24.622
It's my decision.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.749
No, no, no, not
fucking happening!

03:26.832 --> 03:28.793
Just 'cause he's
my dad all of a sudden

03:28.876 --> 03:30.628
doesn't mean he's
automatically fucking
related to Mo!

03:30.711 --> 03:32.797
Yeah, Ricky,
that's exactly what
that does mean.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.800
Dad, look...
Family's about fucking being
there for each other,

03:35.883 --> 03:37.676
stepping up to
the fucking plate
when you have to.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.011
This is fucking
bullshit!

03:39.095 --> 03:40.387
Dad, calm down.

03:40.471 --> 03:41.806
Oh, I'm fucking calm.

03:41.889 --> 03:45.643
(Clattering)

03:45.726 --> 03:47.979
Dad, Mo really
likes him.
Fuck!

03:48.062 --> 03:50.689
I want his great-
grandfather to be
a part of his life.

03:50.773 --> 03:52.775
You're just going to
have to get over it.

03:52.858 --> 03:54.860
He's your father,
like it or not.

03:54.944 --> 03:56.821
Not!
(Thud)

04:00.116 --> 04:02.076
For the first few days
after he told me he was my dad,

04:02.160 --> 04:04.162
I just got fucking wasted.
I had to get it out of my head.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.164
But the booze wasn't working.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.957
Like, I think it
made me <i> more</i> depressed.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.834
So I just put my energy
into working at the rink

04:09.917 --> 04:11.418
and the plants,
and just ignored him.

04:11.502 --> 04:13.087
I'm not sure how
to come to terms with it

04:13.171 --> 04:14.338
but I've got to
fucking deal with it.

04:14.421 --> 04:15.589
I've got to stay calm.

04:15.673 --> 04:17.048
(Squirrel chirps)

04:17.132 --> 04:18.926
Seriously? Right now?

04:19.010 --> 04:20.678
What a fucking
smug little prick.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.513
Listen to him laughing at
my burnt out fucking trailer.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.015
Fucking little asshole!
(Squirrel keeps chirping)

04:24.098 --> 04:25.641
(Clicking)
You think this is funny?

04:27.518 --> 04:29.353
Your fucking traps
are working really well, Randy,

04:29.436 --> 04:31.856
you stupid fucking dummy!
Fuck off!

04:31.939 --> 04:33.524
And you fuck off too.

04:33.607 --> 04:38.487
(Distant gunshots)
Ricky. Frigging idiot.

04:41.157 --> 04:44.535
Man: (shouting)
Fuck off with
the fucking guns!

04:44.618 --> 04:46.996
Jesus fucking Christ!

04:54.378 --> 04:56.588
What the frig
do you want?

04:56.672 --> 04:58.340
You know, I'm sorry
for what happened.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.051
Those guys really
screwed you over.

05:00.134 --> 05:01.969
But maybe, once this
blows over for a bit,

05:02.053 --> 05:03.762
you can try again.

05:03.846 --> 05:05.890
Now I did everything
in my power to help you.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.641
I held up my end
of the bargain.

05:07.725 --> 05:10.102
So now I want
the video back.
That was the deal.

05:10.186 --> 05:11.979
Not a chance.

05:12.063 --> 05:14.148
Remember all those times
you were taking forever

05:14.232 --> 05:16.567
and you said,
"Randy, try harder"?

05:16.650 --> 05:19.820
Well, I'm going to say
the same frigging thing
to you right now.

05:19.904 --> 05:22.322
Ted, try harder!

05:22.406 --> 05:24.158
Randy,

05:24.242 --> 05:26.244
you might want to think
really carefully

05:26.326 --> 05:27.828
about what
you're doing here.

05:27.912 --> 05:31.290
I'm not scared of you,
Ted, or your tiny penis.

05:31.373 --> 05:33.084
Are you sure?

05:33.167 --> 05:35.794
I'm going to give you today
to think it through.

05:35.878 --> 05:38.797
Don't make me take this
to the next level.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.099
Bubbles:
This might be the
dumbest fucking thing

05:48.182 --> 05:49.934
you've ever done,
actually, Julian.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.727
You know what?
I want to go home.
Just take me home.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.687
Bubs, it's fine.
They didn't even
have fucking cameras

05:53.771 --> 05:55.647
in the parking lot, man.

05:55.731 --> 05:57.816
How do you know
if they had cameras
in the parking lot?

05:57.900 --> 06:00.652
Because cops don't
think people would be
fucking crazy enough

06:00.736 --> 06:02.821
to steal a fucking car
in their parking lot, man.

06:02.905 --> 06:04.282
That's why they leave
their keys in the ignition.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.741
They're stupid.

06:05.824 --> 06:06.951
We're not going
to go home.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.120
We need to make
some fucking money.

06:09.203 --> 06:11.789
Check the glove box,
see if there's anything
in there worth selling.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.540
Don't boss me around.

06:13.624 --> 06:16.460
(Mocking tone)
"Don't boss me around."

06:16.543 --> 06:18.963
Some golf passes
here, cart included.
You see, there you go.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.214
That's 100 bucks
right there.

06:22.300 --> 06:24.302
Jesus Murphy.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.637
Whose truck did
we take? Ron Jeremy's?

06:26.720 --> 06:27.972
Jesus.
Well, why's that
in the glove box?

06:28.055 --> 06:29.974
Just put that away.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.351
Here's the registration.

06:32.434 --> 06:34.937
Oh, my blistering fuck!

06:35.020 --> 06:36.981
It's George Green's
truck, Julian!

06:37.064 --> 06:39.150
Oh, my God,
we've got to dump it!

06:39.233 --> 06:41.193
We've got to dump it!
Let's... pull over here!
No, no, no...

06:41.277 --> 06:43.154
Fuck that.
We need to sell it.

06:43.237 --> 06:44.529
Sell it?

06:44.613 --> 06:46.073
Who in the fuck's
going to buy a hot truck

06:46.157 --> 06:47.325
that belongs to
the chief of police?

06:47.407 --> 06:48.617
Think about that!

06:49.994 --> 06:51.870
So what the fuck is up,
poppy suckers?

06:51.954 --> 06:53.538
What's up, Reg?
Just looking to unload

06:53.622 --> 06:55.457
this fucking
thing fast, man.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.876
Yeah, oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.586
Is it hot?

06:59.670 --> 07:01.380
Umm... it's, you know...

07:01.463 --> 07:03.966
I don't think I have
the paperwork. It...
Julian,

07:04.049 --> 07:06.426
it's a little hotter
than that, I'd say.

07:06.510 --> 07:07.761
Ehhh... how hot?

07:09.429 --> 07:11.182
It's... it's not cold.

07:11.265 --> 07:13.351
It might as well be
sitting on the surface
of the fucking sun!

07:13.433 --> 07:14.852
Ah-ha...
Yeah, it's great.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.229
Ah, well, I could
use it for scrap.

07:17.313 --> 07:18.563
Give you 200 bucks for it.

07:18.647 --> 07:20.607
200 bucks! Come on, man.

07:20.691 --> 07:22.360
Look, we need 723 bucks

07:22.442 --> 07:24.403
or the cops are going to
crush his little fucking truck.

07:24.486 --> 07:27.572
No shit. You're dealing
with those fucking
weasel-fuckers, huh?

07:27.656 --> 07:29.700
Dougie Dixon? That
guy's a piece of shit.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.160
No, George Green.

07:31.243 --> 07:34.246
Oh, he's a cocksucker
too, slimy little fucker.

07:34.330 --> 07:35.998
That's it? 200 bucks?

07:36.081 --> 07:37.541
It's all I can
do for you, bro.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.710
Now, if you guys could
find me some steel,

07:39.793 --> 07:41.503
I can move that shit

07:41.586 --> 07:44.548
quicker than a hooker
going down on a billy goat.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.717
That makes no sense!

07:46.800 --> 07:49.720
(Growling)

07:49.803 --> 07:51.555
All right, whatever
the fuck you are to me,

07:51.638 --> 07:53.057
we need to get some things
straight right now, okay?

07:53.140 --> 07:54.433
Apparently you can
hang out with Mo.

07:54.516 --> 07:56.268
That's my
daughter's decision.

07:56.352 --> 07:58.603
But when it comes to me and
you, we don't fucking talk!

07:58.687 --> 08:00.064
Don't say a fucking
word to me!

08:00.147 --> 08:01.481
Don't even look at me

08:01.565 --> 08:03.067
unless I say it's
okay to look at me

08:03.150 --> 08:04.235
and I don't ever see
that fucking happening!

08:04.318 --> 08:05.986
Got it?
Sure, Rick.

08:06.070 --> 08:07.238
Good.
Whatever it takes.

08:07.321 --> 08:08.822
But listen...

08:08.906 --> 08:10.824
I just want
you to know,

08:10.908 --> 08:12.243
that there were
a lot of reasons

08:12.326 --> 08:14.828
why I was the way
I was over the years.

08:14.912 --> 08:16.496
I don't give a fuck!

08:16.580 --> 08:18.416
Rick, you have no idea

08:18.498 --> 08:20.584
how much
I wrestled with this.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.295
A secret this big?

08:23.379 --> 08:25.964
Not knowing how
to deal with it.

08:26.048 --> 08:28.842
Why do you think I turned
to the liquor so often?

08:28.926 --> 08:30.761
So I made you a
fucking alcoholic?

08:30.844 --> 08:32.636
Is that what
you're saying to me?
No, no, no.

08:32.721 --> 08:35.307
No, it was... a lot
of fucking things.

08:38.352 --> 08:41.020
But that's all
changed now, Ricky.

08:41.105 --> 08:43.690
Because of...
this little guy...

08:46.026 --> 08:48.737
I finally have
a reason to stay off
the liquor for good.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.949
Ricky, I know...

08:52.032 --> 08:54.452
that, when I was
on the liquor,
I was delusional.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.037
I was out of control.
Yeah!

08:57.121 --> 08:59.748
But I'm never going back.

08:59.831 --> 09:01.875
Little Mo saved
my life, Ricky.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.297
Yeah, he's...

09:06.380 --> 09:08.340
pretty fucking
special, isn't he?

09:11.051 --> 09:12.761
I'm sorry, Ricky.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.848
I'm sorry for everything.

09:16.932 --> 09:19.184
I was wrong not to tell
you all these years.

09:20.936 --> 09:23.647
(Shaky breath)
Are you crying?

09:23.730 --> 09:27.318
No, I...
Look, I...

09:27.401 --> 09:29.820
I know after all
that's happened,

09:29.903 --> 09:31.989
it's probably impossible

09:32.072 --> 09:34.866
for you to believe
or... even understand.

09:38.454 --> 09:40.164
I've always
loved you, Ricky.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.419
(Shaky voice)
Don't fucking cry.

09:45.503 --> 09:47.879
(Sobbing)

09:47.963 --> 09:51.425
It just makes no sense,
everything you did to me.

09:51.509 --> 09:55.012
I thought it was for
your own good, Ricky.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.972
But I was wrong.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.933
Both:
(Sobbing)

10:00.017 --> 10:01.893
Julian:
Hey!

10:01.977 --> 10:03.854
What the fuck is
going on here?

10:03.937 --> 10:06.064
Why are you guys
crying? Who died?

10:06.148 --> 10:08.733
Nobody fucking
got dead, Bubs.

10:08.817 --> 10:12.070
Well what, then?

10:12.154 --> 10:16.074
Baste yourselves, boys.

10:16.158 --> 10:17.701
Jim Lahey...

10:17.784 --> 10:19.661
is my father.

10:19.744 --> 10:22.456
The real one.
What?

10:22.540 --> 10:25.209
Oh, they smashed
up Coconut Ronda.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.252
Fuck. I'm telling
you, man,

10:27.336 --> 10:29.213
don't let that fucking
nightmare Lahey into
your life, man.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.714
He's always got
another angle.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.383
I told you. I don't want
to fucking talk about it.

10:32.466 --> 10:33.884
I'm trying to block
it the fuck out

10:33.967 --> 10:35.260
so I can concentrate
on everything else.

10:35.344 --> 10:37.137
That's probably
a good idea, Ricky.

10:37.221 --> 10:38.389
Yeah, well,
being that said,

10:38.472 --> 10:40.098
where's the
nutrients, boys?

10:40.182 --> 10:41.600
Why?

10:41.683 --> 10:43.602
For the fucking plants.

10:43.685 --> 10:46.522
What?
Ricky, the plants
are alive?

10:46.605 --> 10:48.940
Of course the fucking
plants are alive.
I hid them at the rink.

10:49.024 --> 10:51.943
But they're thirsty
boys. Where the fuck
is the Nuclear Bloom?

10:52.027 --> 10:54.905
Ricky, the Nuclear Bloom
is on the back of my
fucking truck

10:54.988 --> 10:57.115
at the impound, about to
get crushed to smithereens.

10:57.199 --> 10:59.117
Yeah, we need
523 bucks.

10:59.201 --> 11:01.579
Reggie said to acquire
some steel and he'd
buy it off us.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.248
We've just got
to figure out where to
get some fucking steel.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.583
Steel?
(Chuckles)

11:05.665 --> 11:07.418
That's fucking easy.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.587
I know where we can
get all the fucking
steel that we need.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.838
(Grunting)
Fuck off!

11:14.508 --> 11:16.801
It's kind of fucked that
we're stealing steel, boys,

11:16.885 --> 11:18.970
when you think about it.
What?

11:19.054 --> 11:20.514
Well, steel's the only
thing you could steal

11:20.598 --> 11:22.474
that it's itself, right?

11:22.558 --> 11:24.435
Ricky, what the fuck
are you talking about?

11:24.518 --> 11:26.770
Are you okay, Ricky?
Yeah, I'm just
saying, you know,

11:26.853 --> 11:29.273
if we weren't stealing steel,
we'd be stealing something
that wasn't steel.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.732
So stealing steel's
kind of like...

11:30.815 --> 11:32.943
It's a stealing steel...

11:33.026 --> 11:34.612
For fuck's sakes, this
isn't fucking working!

11:34.694 --> 11:36.154
What's wrong?

11:36.238 --> 11:38.782
I asked my fucking
brain nicely to shut
the fuck up

11:38.865 --> 11:40.200
but no matter what I
distract-ulate it with,

11:40.284 --> 11:43.621
it gets blurting things
out about fucking Lahey!

11:43.703 --> 11:46.540
Ohh, my brain's a fucking
asshole sometimes, boys.

11:46.624 --> 11:48.959
I don't know how to
come to terms with this.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.629
Like, it's bad enough
Lahey's going to be my
fucking dad, I guess,

11:51.711 --> 11:54.047
but, if he marries Randy,
Randy's going to
be my fucking uncle.

11:54.131 --> 11:55.674
Think about that one.

11:55.757 --> 11:58.302
That's not exactly
accurate, Ricky.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.887
What? He's going
to be what, then?
My cousint?

12:02.889 --> 12:06.017
Hmmm...
Oh, my fucking God.

12:06.101 --> 12:07.727
Oh, my fucking God.

12:07.811 --> 12:10.481
Randy is going to be
my fucking brother?

12:10.564 --> 12:12.524
No.
Hmmm...

12:12.608 --> 12:15.319
Actually he'd be
your stepfather, man.

12:15.402 --> 12:18.155
Or stepmother,
depending on how they
file the paperwork.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.573
Could be your
stepmother.

12:19.657 --> 12:22.742
No, fuck!
(Sigh)

12:22.826 --> 12:24.662
You know what, boys?
I can't deal with this.
Fuck it!

12:24.744 --> 12:26.204
I'm moving to Toronto
and becoming
a street person.

12:26.288 --> 12:27.706
No, Ricky.
This is fucked!

12:27.789 --> 12:29.833
Ricky, just wait. Listen.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.877
Look, Lahey might be
your father but he'll
never be your dad.

12:34.796 --> 12:36.340
Well, it's the same
fucking thing.
What do you mean?

12:36.423 --> 12:38.676
It's not the
same thing, Ricky.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.345
Look, Lahey, technically
he did father you,

12:41.428 --> 12:43.681
therefore he
is your "father"

12:43.763 --> 12:45.056
but Ray...

12:45.140 --> 12:47.434
Ray's the one that
loved you, Ricky.

12:47.518 --> 12:50.020
He loved you
and he raised you

12:50.103 --> 12:51.647
and he taught you
everything that you know.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.440
He did.
He turned you into Ricky.

12:53.524 --> 12:56.193
He was my father...
You are Ricky
because of Ray

12:56.276 --> 12:58.236
and that's what
a dad does, Ricky.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.698
You were pretty fucking
lucky to have such
an awesome one, man.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.450
Thanks, boys.

13:03.534 --> 13:05.118
I fucking
love you guys.

13:05.202 --> 13:07.454
I love you too, Ricky.
Who's got that belly?

13:07.538 --> 13:10.415
Yip!
Let's go fucking
steal some shit!

13:10.499 --> 13:13.711
Or steal some steel!
(Wheezing laugh)

13:13.793 --> 13:15.920
See, it is fucking
cool, isn't it?
It's funny.

13:16.004 --> 13:18.298
See the way I brought
that back around
like a professional.

13:18.382 --> 13:19.841
That's what Gerry Dee
would have done.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.219
Hey, Ran.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.845
I brought you a
triple triple, bud.

13:28.183 --> 13:29.560
What's the matter?

13:32.646 --> 13:34.314
I can't marry you, sir.

13:34.398 --> 13:37.735
What? Why?

13:39.361 --> 13:42.822
If I marry you, then
Ricky becomes my stepson.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.409
And any inkling of a chance

13:45.492 --> 13:49.037
that I had of becoming
a cop is gone forever.

13:49.120 --> 13:52.082
Randy, don't
be ridiculous.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.585
Being a cop isn't
as glamorous as
it looks, Randy.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.127
Trust me.

13:56.211 --> 13:58.004
Oh, well, I wasn't
doing it for the glamour.

13:58.088 --> 13:59.798
I was doing it for you.

13:59.881 --> 14:03.594
I wanted you to be proud
of your new wife.

14:03.677 --> 14:04.844
Now look at me.

14:04.928 --> 14:06.930
Sitting here
getting wasted,

14:07.013 --> 14:09.767
crying in my frigging
cheeseburgers.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.519
All I've ever wanted
was for you to be
proud of me, Mr. Lahey,

14:12.603 --> 14:14.813
and to respect me.

14:14.896 --> 14:17.941
Randy,

14:18.024 --> 14:20.110
I respect you
in this moment

14:20.193 --> 14:23.280
more than I've ever
respected you in my life.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.532
Now you know
what it's like

14:25.616 --> 14:27.743
to be driven to
drink by the boys.

14:30.036 --> 14:32.330
I love you, Randy,

14:32.414 --> 14:35.542
and I want to marry you
now more than ever.

14:35.626 --> 14:38.378
What do you say, bud?

14:38.462 --> 14:39.921
Do you mean that,
Mr. Lahey?

14:40.004 --> 14:41.256
If you'll have me.

14:44.050 --> 14:47.053
I'll drink a toast
to it, Randers.

14:47.137 --> 14:49.473
What do you got?
You can't drink,
Mr. Lahey.

14:49.556 --> 14:50.974
It's only wine, Randy.

14:51.057 --> 14:53.685
I can handle
a little bit of wine.

14:53.769 --> 14:55.646
And you know
what it's like...

14:55.729 --> 14:57.981
when I drink
the wine, bud.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.568
I sure do.

15:01.652 --> 15:03.779
It's time to
get paid, boys.

15:03.862 --> 15:05.071
Thank fuck.

15:08.032 --> 15:10.243
(Police siren chirps)

15:10.327 --> 15:11.662
Oh, fuck, the cops.

15:11.745 --> 15:13.330
All right, pull over and
get us out of this, man.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.748
Fuck. I don't know
if I can, boys.

15:14.832 --> 15:16.249
What? What
do you mean?

15:16.333 --> 15:18.251
I'm not in the right
frames of the mind.

15:18.335 --> 15:20.003
What the fuck are you
talking about, man?
You can do this!

15:20.086 --> 15:22.088
No. No, I can't.
(Engine revving)

15:22.172 --> 15:23.965
Ricky!
Jesus Christ, Ricky!

15:24.048 --> 15:25.509
What the fuck
are you doing?

15:25.592 --> 15:27.010
We can't outrun
them in this,

15:27.093 --> 15:29.471
especially with
750 fucking pounds
in the trunk.

15:29.554 --> 15:31.264
My fucking brain's got
too many thinks going on!

15:31.348 --> 15:32.932
I can't think my
thocks straight!

15:33.016 --> 15:35.310
Oh, my fuck!
We're out of jail
less than two hours

15:35.393 --> 15:36.895
and we're going
right the fuck back.

15:36.978 --> 15:38.438
We're not going
back to jail.

15:38.522 --> 15:40.148
Oh, really?
Why wouldn't
we, Julian?

15:40.231 --> 15:41.941
We're in a high-speed
fucking chase,

15:42.025 --> 15:43.777
stolen city property,

15:43.861 --> 15:46.655
no goddamn plates,
no insurance,
no registration.

15:46.738 --> 15:49.658
Oh, we're fucked!
(Whimpers)

15:49.741 --> 15:51.159
Here, Ricky,
take that.

15:51.242 --> 15:53.453
You can do this, man.
We believe in you.

15:53.537 --> 15:54.996
You just need
to be focused.

15:55.079 --> 15:56.790
Maybe if I chug the
fucking thing, I guess.

15:56.874 --> 15:58.500
Chug it.
Now, that's it, Ricky.

15:58.583 --> 15:59.918
There you go. Chug it!

16:00.001 --> 16:02.045
Bubbles & Julian:
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

16:02.128 --> 16:04.673
Chug! Chug! Chug!

16:04.756 --> 16:06.800
That's it, Ricky.
Come on!
Go, man. Keep it going.

16:06.884 --> 16:08.968
Let your brain just
start working it out.

16:09.052 --> 16:11.847
Let that dope smoke
figure it out.

16:11.930 --> 16:13.223
Chug it, Ricky! Chug!

16:15.225 --> 16:17.018
Okay, boys.
We're good.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.603
We're good?
Good? You've
got something?

16:18.687 --> 16:21.899
I got this.
Oh, thank fuck.

16:22.023 --> 16:23.567
We believe in you, man.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.151
Ricky:
You guys are going to
fucking love this one.

16:25.235 --> 16:27.987
Stop right there,
hands where
I can see them!

16:28.071 --> 16:30.323
Hands up, fuck-tits!
Put your hands where
I can see them!

16:30.407 --> 16:32.242
Shut the fuck up, you
idiot! I'm a fucking cop!

16:32.325 --> 16:33.660
What?
Yeah, man.

16:33.744 --> 16:35.078
Think I like wearing
my fucking hair like this?

16:35.161 --> 16:36.496
Do you think I like wearing
these fucking clothes?

16:36.580 --> 16:38.248
My wife's making me stay
at the fucking Ramada.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.750
I've been working with
fucking Chief Green

16:39.833 --> 16:41.084
for three months trying
to take these guys down.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.335
Three fucking months!

16:42.419 --> 16:43.670
You just blew my
fucking cover.

16:43.754 --> 16:45.296
What? You're working
with Chief Green?

16:45.380 --> 16:47.173
Yeah, fuck-brains.
Officer Trevor Cory,
deep undercover.

16:47.257 --> 16:49.008
See the two guys
in the car there?

16:49.092 --> 16:52.011
Two of the highest-ranking
members of Satan's Bastards.
Who?

16:52.095 --> 16:54.514
Satan's Bastards,
the fucking motorcycle
gang out of Cape Breton.

16:54.598 --> 16:57.016
You're a fucking cop
and you don't know who
Satan's Bastards are?

16:57.100 --> 16:59.227
Jesus Christ. George
has been trying to take
them down for three months

16:59.310 --> 17:02.146
and you may have just
wrecked the whole fucking
operation, you idiot!

17:02.230 --> 17:04.566
What? I didn't know.

17:04.648 --> 17:06.734
It's all right but when
George finds out about this,
he's going to fucking freak.

17:06.818 --> 17:08.319
His fucking truck
was stolen from the
precinct today.

17:08.403 --> 17:09.905
He's not in a good
fucking mood as it is.

17:09.988 --> 17:11.698
I heard about that.
Oh, my fuck.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.450
I hate to say it, bud,

17:13.532 --> 17:15.034
you're probably going
to lose your badge
over this one.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.787
Oh, for fuck's sakes,
I just got the thing.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.747
No, no, no! Keep
pointing that at me.
We're not fucked yet.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.039
Stay with me here.

17:20.123 --> 17:21.458
Can you please
not tell George

17:21.540 --> 17:23.334
that I fucked
this up, big time?

17:23.417 --> 17:24.920
Well, I don't
want to ruin your
career obviously.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.880
Fuck! Fuck! Cock! fuck!

17:26.964 --> 17:28.673
All right, all right.
What's your fucking name?

17:28.757 --> 17:30.717
It's Gordon.
Okay, Gordon,
stay with me here, bud.

17:30.801 --> 17:32.218
We're okay.
We can do this, okay?

17:32.302 --> 17:33.929
But the two guys
in the car right now,

17:34.012 --> 17:35.889
they're going to be
very, very fucking
suspicious of me.

17:35.973 --> 17:37.766
We'll have to do
something a little
fucked to get this back.

17:37.849 --> 17:39.058
You have any weed
or hash on you?

17:39.142 --> 17:40.477
Yeah, I have
about 20 grams

17:40.560 --> 17:41.895
that I confiscated from
the high school earlier.

17:41.979 --> 17:43.730
Okay, that's
fucking great.
Where is it?

17:43.814 --> 17:45.315
Right front pocket.
Oh, my God, that's
fucking perfect.

17:45.398 --> 17:46.900
In a few seconds,
I'm going to come at you.

17:46.984 --> 17:48.443
We need to struggle.
It has to look fucking real.

17:48.526 --> 17:50.570
I'm going to take your
gun, point it at you.

17:50.654 --> 17:51.989
You have to handcuff
yourself to your
fucking car.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.448
You got it?

17:53.531 --> 17:55.033
I think so.
Okay, I'm coming
at you, Gordon.

17:55.116 --> 17:56.493
You can fucking
do this, bud.
Stay with me. Okay?

17:56.576 --> 17:57.786
Are you ready?
Are you good?

17:57.869 --> 17:59.078
Here I come!
Here I come! Okay.

17:59.162 --> 18:00.580
Take out your
handcuffs right now

18:00.664 --> 18:03.333
and handcuff yourself to
that fucking car, dummy!

18:03.416 --> 18:05.418
Do it, come on!
Move along here!

18:05.502 --> 18:07.128
What the fuck?

18:07.211 --> 18:10.715
(Whispering)
Go on, fucking hurry
up here, Jesus Christ.

18:10.799 --> 18:12.133
What the fuck are
you trying to do?

18:12.216 --> 18:13.593
Hand-cuff myself
like you said.

18:13.677 --> 18:15.053
Well, you should have
used the steering wheel

18:15.136 --> 18:17.305
or something, you
fucking dummy!
Fuck!

18:17.388 --> 18:19.432
Holy fuck, is
that Moroccan?
Yeah.

18:19.516 --> 18:21.351
I'll give this to those
guys as a peace offering

18:21.434 --> 18:22.769
and hopefully it chills
them the fuck out.

18:22.853 --> 18:24.103
And I'm going to tell
fucking Chief Green

18:24.187 --> 18:25.730
you saved the fucking
day today, Gordon.

18:25.814 --> 18:27.398
Thank you,
Officer Cory.
Good job.

18:27.482 --> 18:29.818
I appreciate that.
Right, take care
of yourself.

18:31.528 --> 18:32.904
Ricky, how the fuck
did you do that?

18:32.988 --> 18:34.614
That was unbelievable.
I know.

18:34.698 --> 18:35.949
I may have to chug
joints more often, man.

18:36.033 --> 18:37.492
That was some of
my best work ever.

18:37.575 --> 18:39.285
Incredible, man. That
was fucking incredible.

18:39.369 --> 18:41.621
Here, Bubs, do
you want a gun?
Ahhh! Jesus!

18:41.705 --> 18:42.998
What?
Just put it
down. Let's go.

18:43.081 --> 18:45.416
Here, have some
hash. Chill
the fuck out.

18:45.500 --> 18:46.668
That was fun.
(Engine ignition)

18:46.751 --> 18:48.252
That's Moroccan!

18:52.966 --> 18:54.133
(Engine shuts off)

18:56.219 --> 18:58.137
Well, well, well.

18:58.221 --> 19:00.139
If it isn't the
Right Honourable Ricky
the Slug Fucker.

19:00.223 --> 19:02.183
To what do I owe
this dubious honour?

19:02.266 --> 19:04.227
What are you,
tonguing my shaft there,
you tiger tonguer?

19:04.310 --> 19:06.437
Fucker. How are you
two horse jerkers?

19:07.731 --> 19:10.149
What...
It wasn't a horse.

19:10.233 --> 19:12.151
Ricky: I've got some great
shit for you, brother.
Check it out.

19:12.235 --> 19:14.404
Manhole covers, ten
of the fucking things.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.032
(Clinking)
Looking good.

19:17.115 --> 19:18.700
Give you 100
bucks for them.

19:18.783 --> 19:21.494
100 bucks? You gotta be
fucking kidding me, man.

19:21.578 --> 19:23.914
We used to make more
than that for them in
fucking elementary school.

19:23.997 --> 19:25.707
Well, it ain't frankincense
and fucking myrrh.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.000
They're manhole covers.

19:27.084 --> 19:29.502
That's the price
of steel. 100 bucks.

19:29.586 --> 19:31.504
Fuck. This is just
fucking great, Julian.

19:31.588 --> 19:33.381
Great plan. Now what
are we going to do?

19:33.464 --> 19:35.050
My truck's going
to get crushed.

19:35.133 --> 19:37.343
Did you
crush George's
truck yet?

19:37.427 --> 19:39.512
Maybe we can sell
it on fucking Kijiji
or something.

19:39.596 --> 19:42.265
Oh, no, I crushed
the living shit out
of that thing but, uh,

19:42.348 --> 19:44.684
you know, I did something
under the front seat

19:44.768 --> 19:47.604
that you boys are going
to want to take a look at.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.398
I think you might
be able to use this.

19:50.481 --> 19:52.567
Jesus Christ!

19:52.650 --> 19:53.860
What the fuck?

19:53.944 --> 19:57.363
Holy fuck!

19:57.447 --> 19:59.198
Ted:
Hey, where do you
think you're going...

19:59.282 --> 20:01.325
Julian:
I'm not here to
talk to you, Ted...

20:01.409 --> 20:03.327
Hey...
Ricky: Get the fuck out of the
way there, cock-burger!

20:03.411 --> 20:05.204
You guys can't
just walk in here.

20:05.288 --> 20:06.957
Oh, I think we
actually can, Georgie.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.917
We want Bubbles'
truck back.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.877
Ricky:
And we want you to stop
fucking with us forever.

20:10.961 --> 20:13.630
(Sigh)
So you're here to
nail me, are you?

20:13.713 --> 20:15.465
You're fucking
rights I am.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.634
Ricky:
Let's go with the keys,
you deep-fried shit-log!

20:19.343 --> 20:22.388
I've got to admit you
guys are pretty good.

20:22.472 --> 20:24.099
I think you got
me this time.

20:24.182 --> 20:25.475
You take a great
picture there, George.

20:28.645 --> 20:31.940
A calendar we did,
to raise money for
breast cancer.

20:32.023 --> 20:33.650
Big hit down at the
flea market, too.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.569
Raised a ton of cash.

20:36.653 --> 20:39.280
What else have
you got, tough guy?
For fuck's sakes.

20:39.363 --> 20:43.493
Look, George, that's a
really nice thing you did
there for a great cause.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.579
But can I just have my
fucking truck back, please?

20:46.663 --> 20:48.123
I didn't do anything
wrong and you know it.

20:48.206 --> 20:50.333
I saved up the money
forever to get that truck

20:50.416 --> 20:52.585
and I need it
for my business.

20:52.669 --> 20:54.253
Okay, Bubbles,
I'll tell you what.

20:54.337 --> 20:56.297
I'll give you
the truck back.

20:56.380 --> 20:57.590
One condition.

20:57.674 --> 20:59.425
You return my truck
to my parking space,

20:59.509 --> 21:00.760
your truck
is free to go.

21:00.844 --> 21:03.096
I didn't take
your truck, though.

21:03.180 --> 21:04.430
Probably not...

21:04.514 --> 21:07.851
but I'm guessing
you know who did.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.103
No idea what you're
talking about, George.

21:10.187 --> 21:12.438
You know what? I don't
even give a fuck the
truck was stolen.

21:12.522 --> 21:14.816
Come on. Get in here,
shut the door.

21:14.899 --> 21:17.610
Thing is, being
chief of police,

21:17.694 --> 21:19.779
the insurance companies
tend not to question claims.

21:19.863 --> 21:21.990
So...

21:22.073 --> 21:24.868
New set of golf clubs,
brand new set of skis,

21:24.951 --> 21:26.953
a couple of really
nice vintage guitars,

21:27.037 --> 21:30.456
top-of-the-line
hockey gear. All gone.

21:30.540 --> 21:32.542
Bubbles:
Come on, George, this
is fucking bullshit

21:32.625 --> 21:34.544
and you know it.
Just give me the
truck back.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.295
I'll sweeten the deal.

21:36.379 --> 21:38.297
I don't even want
the thing back.

21:38.381 --> 21:40.175
I just want
someone in this room

21:40.258 --> 21:43.803
to admit they took it.
That's it. You can walk away.

21:43.887 --> 21:45.763
So, if somebody in
this room right here,

21:45.847 --> 21:47.348
admitted they
took the truck,

21:47.431 --> 21:50.852
there'd be no consequences
and we could get my truck?

21:50.935 --> 21:54.480
Fuck. If I stole the
fucking thing, I would
tell you. But I didn't!

21:54.564 --> 21:57.692
Heh, okay. Ted, can you
get the fuck in here
a minute, please?

21:59.402 --> 22:01.029
Yeah, chief?

22:01.112 --> 22:02.655
Could you escort these
gentlemen out of the building?

22:02.739 --> 22:04.699
And when you're done that,

22:04.782 --> 22:07.660
get the vehicles
slated crushed over
to Dixon's junkyard.

22:07.744 --> 22:09.662
And...

22:09.746 --> 22:11.372
make sure you tell
him to crush them...

22:11.455 --> 22:14.667
extra small.

22:14.751 --> 22:17.378
(Whimpering)
Extra small.
Come on, buddy.

22:17.461 --> 22:20.048
My poor little truck's
going to be extra small.

22:20.131 --> 22:22.842
Just like the size of
both of your cocks.
Come on, come on.

22:22.926 --> 22:25.511
Dicks!

22:25.595 --> 22:27.222
(Joyful sigh)

22:27.305 --> 22:28.932
This is fucking
bullshit, Julian.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.558
You could have
fucking saved that.

22:30.641 --> 22:32.643
What the fuck was I
supposed to do, huh?

22:32.727 --> 22:34.312
You know he would have
fucked us over anyway.

22:34.395 --> 22:36.480
Think about it.
He might not have.

22:36.564 --> 22:38.900
Look, we'll try
to get you another
truck somehow, okay?

22:38.983 --> 22:41.236
Oh, yeah, we'll get
you another one.
No big deal.

22:41.319 --> 22:43.738
Boys, the fucking truck
is the least of our
fucking worries right now.

22:43.821 --> 22:45.990
If we don't get back
the Nuclear Bloom,
I can tell you this:

22:46.074 --> 22:47.575
There is no
fucking possible way

22:47.658 --> 22:49.827
to grow that much dope
in time. We're fucked!

22:49.911 --> 22:51.746
Hey, Julian.

22:51.829 --> 22:54.040
What?

22:54.124 --> 22:56.626
I could easily make sure
that truck never gets
down to Dixon's

22:56.709 --> 23:00.588
if you were to, uh,
do me a little favour.

23:00.671 --> 23:02.381
What the fuck is it?

23:02.465 --> 23:04.926
(Piano music)
(Lahey singing)

23:05.009 --> 23:07.053
What the fuck is
going on in there?

23:07.137 --> 23:09.013
That's
"Flight of the Bumblebee".

23:09.097 --> 23:10.807
(Whispering)
Let's go.

23:10.890 --> 23:14.102
(Singing continues)

23:14.185 --> 23:17.147
Oh my fuck!
Oh my sweet Jesus!

23:17.230 --> 23:20.024
Ricky:
Jesus fucking Christ!

23:20.108 --> 23:23.111
What the fuck is
wrong with you two?

23:23.194 --> 23:26.281
Huh?
What can I do
for you, Julian?

23:26.364 --> 23:29.117
Look, there's a
certain sexual video

23:29.200 --> 23:31.328
that Randy's been using
to blackmail somebody

23:31.410 --> 23:32.787
and we're not leaving
here without it.

23:32.870 --> 23:34.289
We want it right
the fuck now!

23:34.372 --> 23:35.957
What's he talking
about, Randy?

23:36.040 --> 23:37.541
I don't know what you're
talking about, Bubbles.

23:37.625 --> 23:39.669
Lahey:
Eh... Talking about
a sexual video

23:39.752 --> 23:42.672
that you're blackmailing
somebody with, Randy. Who?

23:42.755 --> 23:44.007
(Chuckling)
Holy shit...

23:44.090 --> 23:45.758
You don't know, do you?

23:45.842 --> 23:48.469
Randy, I suggest
you hand over
the fucking video

23:48.552 --> 23:51.722
or I'm going to explain
every little detail to
your fucking fiancÃ© here.

23:51.806 --> 23:54.976
Randy!
Where is it?

23:55.059 --> 23:57.603
It's on my phone.

23:57.687 --> 24:01.024
So my father's a bee
and he's a flower?

24:01.107 --> 24:02.984
He's a flower,
Ricky, and a bee

24:03.067 --> 24:06.570
and there's probably
some kind of a pollination
thing going on here.

24:06.654 --> 24:07.989
...stinger cock...

24:08.072 --> 24:09.490
Did you make any
copies of this?

24:09.573 --> 24:11.284
I'm not smart enough
for that, Julian.

24:11.368 --> 24:12.994
Fucking idiot.
All right, let's go.

24:13.077 --> 24:15.496
Fuck boys, I hope this
doesn't run in the family.

24:15.579 --> 24:17.498
No. No, you should
be okay, Ricky.

24:17.581 --> 24:19.000
Should be all right.

24:19.083 --> 24:22.337
Next time please knock.

24:22.420 --> 24:25.506
Randy, I want to know
what's on that videotape

24:25.589 --> 24:29.010
or the engagement's off.

24:29.093 --> 24:31.846
What?
Well...

24:31.929 --> 24:34.224
What, Randy?

24:34.307 --> 24:36.684
So honey comes
from a bee's cock?

24:36.767 --> 24:39.020
No, Ricky.
Ricky.

24:39.103 --> 24:41.564
(Happy grunts)
...this, buddy.

24:41.647 --> 24:44.567
There she is.
(Giggling)

24:44.650 --> 24:46.569
How did you make out?
We got it.

24:46.652 --> 24:48.654
Did you get rid of
the dash-cam footage
of us from earlier?

24:48.738 --> 24:50.323
All done.
Nice.

24:50.407 --> 24:52.367
So, we have
a deal, then.

24:52.450 --> 24:54.285
Mmmm...
I don't know.

24:54.369 --> 24:56.537
Julian, what the
fuck are you doing?
Give him the video.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.373
Bubs, this deal's
kind of unfair, man.

24:58.456 --> 25:01.876
No, it isn't unfair.
It's perfectly fair!

25:01.959 --> 25:04.545
Give him the sex video
and let's get my truck.

25:04.628 --> 25:06.214
This video's worth
a fuck of a lot more

25:06.297 --> 25:07.548
than that
shitty truck, man.

25:07.631 --> 25:09.884
Watch your mouth.

25:09.967 --> 25:11.219
(Sighs)

25:13.471 --> 25:15.056
What's the story
on the Caddy?

25:15.139 --> 25:16.557
Is that being crushed?
No.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.935
It's going to auction.

25:19.018 --> 25:21.229
Really?

25:31.155 --> 25:33.116
Okay, boys.
Gotta do this quick.

25:33.199 --> 25:35.076
I've got to get back
to feed Coolnow.

25:35.159 --> 25:38.413
You know, so he's
not fucking with
my kitties, I mean.

25:38.496 --> 25:40.498
You now what, I've been
thinking about it, Bubs.

25:40.581 --> 25:42.417
It wasn't fair of me to
dump him on you like that.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.419
So I'm going to find
a new home for him
tomorrow. All right?

25:44.502 --> 25:46.087
No, Ricky, no.
It's okay.

25:46.170 --> 25:48.214
I mean, he's not that
big of a nuisance.

25:48.298 --> 25:50.007
I'll keep looking after
the little fucker

25:50.091 --> 25:51.968
just 'cause Mo loves him.

25:53.428 --> 25:55.305
Oh, fuck!

25:55.388 --> 25:57.181
(Groans)
Fuck...
What?

25:57.265 --> 25:58.975
I don't know what's going
on with my nuts, boys,

25:59.058 --> 26:00.768
they seem to be getting
worse not better.

26:00.851 --> 26:02.937
There's an awful fucking
stink coming off them too.

26:03.020 --> 26:05.273
Jesus Christ,
what kind of a stink, Ricky?

26:05.356 --> 26:07.150
They're probably
fucking infected.
I don't know.

26:07.233 --> 26:08.985
I haven't had time
to deal with them.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.945
It's not easy to see.
It takes some fucking
planning.

26:11.028 --> 26:12.696
How much of this shit are
we going to need right now?

26:12.780 --> 26:14.532
All of it.
All of it?

26:14.615 --> 26:16.951
Yeah.
How many fucking
plants are in there?

26:17.034 --> 26:18.953
Come take a look.

26:19.036 --> 26:20.371
Ah, fuck...

26:23.707 --> 26:24.959
Julian:
What are you doing, Ricky?

26:25.042 --> 26:27.044
Are you going to turn on
some fucking lights?

26:29.213 --> 26:31.632
Holy fuck!

26:31.715 --> 26:35.428
My fuck, Ricky. When you
said you were hiding the
plants at the rink,

26:35.512 --> 26:37.180
I didn't think you
meant like this.

26:37.263 --> 26:39.640
This isn't really
hiding anything.
Yes, it is.

26:39.723 --> 26:42.519
It's hiding them from
the people outside,
like out in the world.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.354
This is...

26:44.437 --> 26:46.523
it's fucking
amazing, man.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.607
Are you sure there's
enough plants to fill
the order, though?

26:48.691 --> 26:51.902
Ricky:
Oh, yeah, big time. I did
all the calculations myself.

26:51.986 --> 26:54.322
Uh-oh.
What?

26:54.405 --> 26:55.614
Well, no offense,
Ricky,

26:55.698 --> 26:57.950
but you stopped going
to math in Grade 6.

26:58.034 --> 27:00.077
It's not really math,
fucking 30,000 bottles,

27:00.161 --> 27:01.620
one gram per bottle
is 30,000 grams,

27:01.704 --> 27:03.998
454 grams in a pound,
we need about 66 pounds

27:04.081 --> 27:07.668
about a quarter pound
per plant, 264 plants.

27:07.751 --> 27:10.338
And we're going to
grow 350 just to be safe.

27:10.421 --> 27:13.299
Holy fuck, Ricky,
that was unbelievable!
What?

27:13.383 --> 27:16.886
Well, that's how you should
have been doing math
calculations your whole life.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.388
You should have
been treating
everything like a...

27:18.471 --> 27:20.264
like a weed
calculation.

27:20.348 --> 27:21.682
I never really
thought about that.

27:21.765 --> 27:23.184
We should be good, boys.

27:23.267 --> 27:24.561
And after everything
we've been through,

27:24.643 --> 27:26.020
what the fuck else
could possibly go wrong?

27:26.103 --> 27:28.064
Really?
Oh...

27:28.147 --> 27:30.400
Ricky, why would
you say that?

27:30.483 --> 27:32.902
That's exactly what the
people in the movies say,

27:32.985 --> 27:34.529
right before everything
does go to shit.

27:37.031 --> 27:40.410
I really need my family.
Two days, promise.

27:40.493 --> 27:41.785
Yeah, sure.

27:41.869 --> 27:43.580
You're a good
granddaughter, Trin.

27:43.662 --> 27:47.124
(Theme music)

28:28.583 --> 28:31.628
(Seabirds squawking)

28:43.598 --> 28:47.351
Fish:
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck off! Fuck!...

28:47.435 --> 28:50.229
Fuck off! Jesus Christ!

28:54.108 --> 28:55.443
(Whisper)
<i>Fuck.</i>

28:55.526 --> 28:57.778
(Light clicks off)
<i>Fuck off.</i>

28:58.305 --> 29:04.663
