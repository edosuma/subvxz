WEBVTT

00:56.790 --> 00:59.041
Hey! Keep walking.

01:05.047 --> 01:06.006
Good morning, sweetheart.

01:06.466 --> 01:09.386
- You didn't have to make breakfast.
- I'm okay.

01:09.886 --> 01:11.012
How was work?

01:13.974 --> 01:17.393
- Perps and paperwork...
- Mark called last evening.

01:19.187 --> 01:20.897
Yeah, I reached him back.

01:21.313 --> 01:24.817
He said he might have another buyer
for that property up in Redding.

01:26.278 --> 01:28.988
He shouldn't be talking to you
about that.

01:28.988 --> 01:31.907
- So, we're not getting it?
- It's complicated.

01:32.909 --> 01:34.619
But I'm working it out.

01:36.578 --> 01:40.875
Look, you didn't make
a bad bet marrying a flatfoot.

01:43.002 --> 01:44.170
I know I didn't.

01:46.046 --> 01:49.968
I'm gonna get us out of this town,
Agnes. Scout's honor.

01:55.806 --> 01:58.851
All right, kids!
Let's go! Get a move on.

01:59.685 --> 02:01.813
- Rise and shine.
- Good morning, daddy.

02:01.813 --> 02:03.188
There she is.

02:04.691 --> 02:07.192
<i>Good morning, the San Haven Home.
Who may I connect you to?</i>

02:07.192 --> 02:10.988
Good morning. I was hoping you
could provide me with some information.

02:10.988 --> 02:14.450
<i>Doctor or patient directory, or is this
in regard to potential residency?</i>

02:14.450 --> 02:18.746
Yes. Yes, of course,
residency at San Haven.

02:18.746 --> 02:20.080
Could you please,
tell me what I need to...

02:20.080 --> 02:22.207
<i>We're at capacity, but if you'd like
to put down a deposit</i>

02:22.207 --> 02:23.667
and be added to our waiting list...

02:23.667 --> 02:25.169
Oh, well, yes. Yes, of course.

02:25.169 --> 02:28.297
I got a wonderful recommendation
from someone who's actually there.

02:28.297 --> 02:29.673
Name's McCutcheon.

02:29.673 --> 02:31.550
<i>- McCutcheon?
- Yeah.</i>

02:31.550 --> 02:35.596
<i>We have no one here by that name.
Is this a patient or an employee?</i>

02:35.596 --> 02:39.392
Strange. A patient. You know what?
I would love to come back for a visit.

02:39.392 --> 02:41.895
What was that address
you gave me again?

02:42.478 --> 02:46.107
Your Honor, the People are requesting
an abbreviated pre-trial period.

02:46.607 --> 02:49.318
This city,
and the McCutcheon family,

02:50.945 --> 02:52.446
have suffered a devastating loss,

02:52.446 --> 02:54.282
and a prolonged legal proceeding,

02:54.282 --> 02:57.201
not to mention the sensational news
coverage that will accompany it,

02:57.201 --> 03:02.831
will only make you, me, and Mr. Mason
complicit in exacerbating their anguish.

03:03.250 --> 03:05.877
Your Honor, Mr. Milligan,
in his rush to hang my clients,

03:05.877 --> 03:07.211
has very conveniently forgot

03:07.211 --> 03:10.799
that everyone not only deserves
but has the right to a fair trial.

03:10.799 --> 03:12.383
If these roles were reversed

03:12.383 --> 03:15.678
and Brooks McCutcheon were sitting
where my clients now sit,

03:16.387 --> 03:18.265
I'm sure his family would want
enough time

03:18.265 --> 03:20.058
for a defense to be prepared for him.

03:20.058 --> 03:21.393
The roles would never be reversed

03:21.393 --> 03:24.895
because Brooks McCutcheon
was nothing like your clients.

03:24.895 --> 03:26.648
- What, Mexican?
- No, murderers.

03:28.899 --> 03:34.405
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!
Quiet in the gallery.

03:35.322 --> 03:37.826
Gentleman, save your squabbling
for the schoolyard.

03:37.826 --> 03:39.869
Your Honor,
I deserve adequate time for discovery.

03:39.869 --> 03:44.248
Mr. Mason is simply looking to delay
this trial for his own purposes.

03:44.248 --> 03:45.375
Top one.

03:45.375 --> 03:48.628
Your honor, I think precedent
agrees with me.

03:48.628 --> 03:50.005
Supreme Court Justice Sutherland,

03:50.005 --> 03:52.090
who wrote last year
in Powell versus Alabama,

03:52.090 --> 03:56.510
that the accused, which my clients are,
in a capital case, which this is,

03:56.845 --> 04:00.307
to have aid to counsel for his defense,
which I am,

04:00.307 --> 04:03.642
includes the right to have sufficient
time to advise with counsel

04:03.642 --> 04:04.894
and to prepare defense

04:04.894 --> 04:07.897
is one of the fundamental rights
of the due process clause,

04:07.897 --> 04:09.273
the 14th Amendment.

04:11.400 --> 04:15.196
I'll take my chances on my interpretation
of the definition of sufficient time

04:15.614 --> 04:18.033
versus Justice Sutherland's.

04:18.617 --> 04:22.369
Trial is to commence on Monday, April
14th. If there's no other business...

04:22.369 --> 04:27.334
Your Honor, we haven't discussed
preemptory challenges.

04:28.167 --> 04:29.918
And I'm assuming you would like to?

04:30.377 --> 04:32.588
Since I'm defending two men,

04:32.588 --> 04:35.175
I believe I have the right
to disallow additional jurors

04:35.175 --> 04:37.636
who might be hostile to my clients.

04:37.636 --> 04:39.637
Isn't it safe to assume

04:40.220 --> 04:43.974
that if a juror is disagreeable
to the Defense Counsel

04:43.974 --> 04:45.225
on behalf of one of these brothers,

04:45.225 --> 04:47.519
they will be equally disagreeable
on the other half?

04:47.519 --> 04:50.105
You can't just dump Rafael and Mateo
into the same trough.

04:50.105 --> 04:52.484
I'm sure they're both fascinating men
of great accomplishment,

04:52.484 --> 04:53.860
but what Counsel is asking for,

04:53.860 --> 04:56.904
extra challenges on top of the twenty
he and I already have,

04:56.904 --> 04:58.322
it's a stall by any other name.

04:58.322 --> 04:59.448
Got it.

04:59.448 --> 05:03.578
Your Honor, pursuant
to California Penal Code 1098,

05:04.162 --> 05:05.997
if the defendants are tried jointly,

05:05.997 --> 05:10.085
the state and the defendants shall,
be entitled to five additional challenges

05:10.085 --> 05:13.213
which may be exercised separately.
So, that's ten more challenges.

05:13.213 --> 05:16.048
- I can do the math.
- Yes, of course, my apologies.

05:16.840 --> 05:19.426
It would also mean that Mr. Milligan
would have an additional ten.

05:19.426 --> 05:22.681
A shameless delay ploy disguised
as weak argument, Your Honor...

05:23.390 --> 05:27.352
Unfortunately, not quite weak enough,
counsel. Granted.

05:29.396 --> 05:30.521
All rise.

05:43.785 --> 05:46.745
Hey, Mason! Do you think
the judge is being fair?

05:46.745 --> 05:48.956
After what Mr. Milligan
so compassionately explained

05:48.956 --> 05:52.084
about the reporting of this trial causing
the McCutcheon family so much pain,

05:52.084 --> 05:53.628
I won't be giving a statement.

05:53.628 --> 05:56.130
I'm sure Mr. Milligan
will be refraining also. Thank you.

05:56.631 --> 05:59.759
An unarmed victim, bloody,
shot through the eye.

05:59.759 --> 06:01.428
Damning evidence against two
Mexican assailants...

06:01.428 --> 06:03.887
Three weeks?
We need three months for this trial.

06:03.887 --> 06:06.850
...that there is no doubt they committed
this heinous crime.

06:24.283 --> 06:25.619
Chow time!

06:49.516 --> 06:51.436
Hey! Give it back.

06:56.357 --> 06:57.817
Stupid spies.

07:13.250 --> 07:14.333
What's wrong?

07:23.592 --> 07:25.094
Fuck.

07:29.390 --> 07:33.435
<i>Join us now
for another hour of truth and justice</i>

07:34.062 --> 07:36.438
with Fighting Frank Finnerty!

07:37.232 --> 07:43.572
<i>I weep today, fellow citizens, for
the loss of one of the city's angels.</i>

07:43.572 --> 07:47.534
Hey, girls, come on. Help me set the
table. Please, thank you.

07:51.204 --> 07:52.497
Mo.

07:53.331 --> 07:57.127
<i>The Hermanos Gallardo,
Rafael and Mateo.</i>

07:58.460 --> 08:00.297
Mo, you want to turn that down?

08:00.921 --> 08:03.383
You don't like it, don't listen.

08:05.092 --> 08:08.471
<i>There is, however,
a cure to this putridness.</i>

08:08.847 --> 08:12.141
<i>As you've heard me speak of
before on this program,</i>

08:12.141 --> 08:15.103
mass deportation back to Mexico.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.984
What's got you cooking, Mo?

08:30.451 --> 08:31.411
No work.

08:32.661 --> 08:35.373
Trucks stopped coming around
Central Ave for three days in a row.

08:36.832 --> 08:38.208
Nothin'?

08:39.669 --> 08:42.297
Wouldn't be if Perkins
wasn't locked away.

08:42.672 --> 08:46.509
He had his hand in everything.
Forcing folks to hire down here.

08:47.552 --> 08:49.387
Now that he's gone...

08:54.017 --> 08:55.143
All right.

08:58.896 --> 09:03.360
No, they just gave us an absurd timeline
to prepare. I'm gonna be here all...

09:03.360 --> 09:06.404
<i>Well, if I'm not up when you get in,
wake me. Promise?</i>

09:08.030 --> 09:09.698
<i>- Bye, sweetie.
- Yeah, bye.</i>

09:09.698 --> 09:10.909
Love you.

09:12.159 --> 09:13.869
Is that what's her name?

09:16.957 --> 09:19.083
I thought we both had to work.

09:19.458 --> 09:23.588
We did, but did you really think
we were gonna wait that long?

09:26.382 --> 09:29.802
- How did you find me?
- I followed your scent, easy.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.224
- What?
- Nothing.

09:36.183 --> 09:40.272
I just I have been here, where you are,
too many times to count

09:40.272 --> 09:41.690
with all-night rewrites.

09:41.690 --> 09:43.775
The stress and the anxiety
and the cigarettes.

09:43.775 --> 09:45.567
I thought the movie business
was glamorous.

09:45.567 --> 09:50.282
It's very glamorous. Yes, we only smoke
Turkish cigarettes, which I have.

09:52.825 --> 09:55.287
- What is that?
- This is my laundry.

09:56.413 --> 09:58.915
- We have to eat.
- I have work to do.

09:59.291 --> 10:01.083
I also have work to do.

10:01.083 --> 10:03.794
Myrna Loy and Ramon Novarro
need something clever to say

10:03.794 --> 10:05.587
by seven AM tomorrow.

10:06.089 --> 10:08.425
Is there a reason
we have to do it alone?

10:10.343 --> 10:11.553
No.

10:12.596 --> 10:15.389
Good. First things first.

10:19.477 --> 10:21.645
Those are traditionally
for the end of the meal.

10:21.645 --> 10:24.273
I somehow knew
you were going to say that.

10:28.527 --> 10:30.779
See, I think I got yours by mistake.

10:34.450 --> 10:37.786
Do not let the unexpected
derail you from your goals.

11:00.100 --> 11:03.063
Why don't we try one of those
Turkish cigarettes?

11:03.063 --> 11:04.356
Okay.

11:17.159 --> 11:18.787
I think you made me blush.

11:55.824 --> 11:57.324
Currency.

11:57.324 --> 11:59.118
Twenty-three, close it.

12:00.370 --> 12:01.580
Keep them.

12:03.873 --> 12:06.583
Thought it might help
pass the time a little.

12:10.797 --> 12:12.257
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

12:13.465 --> 12:16.511
Now, your aunt said
you wanted to be a mechanic,

12:16.511 --> 12:19.346
but I didn't think I could sneak
a whole car in for you to work on,

12:19.346 --> 12:20.724
so what can I bring you?

12:21.099 --> 12:27.105
- Just my family.
- Sure. Look, I know it's late and--

12:27.897 --> 12:30.108
It's not like we sleep much anyway.

12:30.609 --> 12:32.276
It occurred to me,

12:33.694 --> 12:38.782
l don't know you or
your story as well as I should.

12:40.326 --> 12:43.203
How are things in here?

12:46.165 --> 12:47.875
Did something happen?

12:51.420 --> 12:54.548
- I'm your lawyer.
- Somebody put glass in my food.

12:57.635 --> 12:59.846
I'll try and get you some protection.

13:00.180 --> 13:04.058
Look, the only way this is gonna work
is if we all trust each other.

13:05.351 --> 13:08.021
How long have you
been at the Hooverville?

13:11.106 --> 13:12.149
A few years.

13:12.149 --> 13:14.819
And where did you come
from before that?

13:15.235 --> 13:18.238
Here. We've always been from here.

13:18.949 --> 13:20.700
Our parents had a farm,

13:20.700 --> 13:24.955
but the city folk came and took it away
from them to build a road on it.

13:26.289 --> 13:29.376
Then we lived in an apartment
on Sierra Street...

13:30.585 --> 13:31.753
until it burned down.

13:34.089 --> 13:37.342
I lost my family farm.
Hard to let go.

13:39.052 --> 13:40.887
What happened to yours?

13:43.848 --> 13:45.809
l forgot to pay my taxes.

13:48.561 --> 13:53.315
Yeah, look, I do have
to ask you something.

13:53.315 --> 13:56.860
The DA said they found
Rafael's fingerprints on Brooks's car.

13:56.860 --> 14:00.949
- That's impossible. I wasn't there.
- They're lying.

14:02.242 --> 14:06.120
I just needed to ask you, that's all.
I'll get your family here.

14:14.670 --> 14:15.797
Yes?

14:18.258 --> 14:20.885
Your Honor,
I was told you were still here.

14:21.386 --> 14:22.386
Sit.

14:22.928 --> 14:24.054
Thank you.

14:31.228 --> 14:36.734
- Have you read it? Bestseller.
- I'm not much of a reader.

14:38.694 --> 14:42.323
Literature is always a boon
to the theatrical barrister.

14:42.657 --> 14:44.950
This one's a bit exotic for my taste.

14:44.950 --> 14:47.746
Farms and weddings and such in China.

14:49.204 --> 14:52.124
Papers say they're gonna get clobbered
by the Japanese any day now,

14:52.124 --> 14:55.545
and whatever they're bowing
and making rice about in here,

14:55.545 --> 14:58.881
it's not looking like
it's headed for a happily ever after.

14:58.881 --> 15:00.759
Here not much does either.

15:02.594 --> 15:05.472
What happily ever after
are you looking for, Mr. Mason?

15:05.472 --> 15:08.015
My clients are being abused
in the jail upstairs.

15:08.015 --> 15:11.436
I'd like to ask for you to mandate
their protection.

15:11.436 --> 15:12.896
It's prison, Mr. Mason.

15:13.271 --> 15:16.065
We don't appoint nannies to the ones
who aren't settling in well.

15:16.065 --> 15:18.567
They're being targeted
because of the notoriety of their case.

15:18.567 --> 15:20.486
That's why it's always best
to kill a nobody.

15:20.486 --> 15:23.323
It seems to rankle fewer people.

15:23.906 --> 15:24.991
Your Honor.

15:24.991 --> 15:26.617
At some point, Mr. Mason,

15:26.617 --> 15:30.537
you must find all of your righteousness
just a bit exhausting,

15:30.955 --> 15:32.457
I need to be somewhere.

15:35.418 --> 15:39.254
I can't say too many of your ilk
come out on top,

15:39.254 --> 15:41.549
but I've often admired their fight.

15:43.385 --> 15:47.346
There was little of that idealism
when I began practicing in the 1890s.

15:47.346 --> 15:50.684
I was just a boy back then.
When L.A. could've been anything.

15:50.684 --> 15:53.852
Yeah, we were just a dirt patch
by the sea.

15:54.312 --> 15:57.690
Back then, I represented anyone
who would pay my bills.

15:58.108 --> 16:01.694
I suppose I always thought the
whole city was just lawless back then.

16:01.694 --> 16:07.117
We had 'em. Laws. And they were
applied more or less equally.

16:08.827 --> 16:11.788
It was later they became more of a tool.

16:14.124 --> 16:15.458
But when you build
the whole damn place,

16:15.458 --> 16:17.751
you get to make
the whole damn rulebook.

16:18.461 --> 16:21.630
Maybe that's what makes it so hard
to survive here all these years later.

16:21.630 --> 16:25.134
So few people have control
over their own fate.

16:25.134 --> 16:26.678
So, as you dangle,

16:26.678 --> 16:31.015
you just hope that whoever's got you out
there will be compassionate.

16:37.021 --> 16:38.689
All right, Mr. Mason,

16:40.191 --> 16:45.362
I'll think about doing something so that
your clients aren't such sitting ducks.

16:46.615 --> 16:48.616
But I fear, on this case,

16:50.075 --> 16:54.121
that's about as close as you're going
to get to a happily ever after.

16:55.664 --> 16:57.000
Your Honor.

17:59.062 --> 18:03.107
Phippsy, remind me to find out when
we can expect a geological report

18:03.107 --> 18:04.234
for any new wells.

18:04.234 --> 18:05.360
Miss Nygaard.

18:12.909 --> 18:14.744
Mr. Mason and Miss Street.

18:18.664 --> 18:21.668
Melville Phipps.
Miss Nygaard's attorney.

18:22.460 --> 18:25.504
How do you do?
Good to see you, Miss Nygaard.

18:25.504 --> 18:27.674
Camilla, please. Mr. Mason.

18:28.216 --> 18:31.678
Miss Nygaard. People still drilling
for new wells these days?

18:33.221 --> 18:38.643
Just tying up leases. Whatever I get
now my competitors can't get later.

18:39.185 --> 18:41.145
Competitors being the McCutcheons?

18:42.022 --> 18:46.108
And the other asses. I'm sorry,
does my language offend you?

18:46.108 --> 18:47.860
No, no, not at all. Go right ahead.

18:48.612 --> 18:51.489
Because that's downright polite
compared to what they've called me.

18:52.072 --> 18:55.993
But we do actually all try to be
more civil in our old age.

18:55.993 --> 19:00.624
Create some rules.
Work together, when it serves.

19:00.998 --> 19:03.000
Helps to keep the peace.

19:05.961 --> 19:07.463
This is called a reformer.

19:08.381 --> 19:12.217
Helps to firm the core.
How is your core, Mr. Mason?

19:13.845 --> 19:14.970
Pretty good.

19:14.970 --> 19:18.682
Well, I'm sure your clients admire
that level of confidence.

19:18.682 --> 19:21.602
Perhaps we should get down
to the reason for your visit.

19:21.602 --> 19:23.312
Phippsy, you make it all sound
so mysterious.

19:23.312 --> 19:26.066
I'm sure they're here to talk about
Brooks McCutcheon.

19:26.732 --> 19:30.028
What else could it be?
It's certainly not tips on exercising.

19:30.028 --> 19:33.156
I remember at the recital,
you spoke warmly of Brooks.

19:33.156 --> 19:35.616
- Did you know him well?
- Since he was a boy.

19:36.076 --> 19:39.621
- I actually gave him piano lessons.
- Was he any good?

19:40.037 --> 19:43.083
About as good as he was
at anything else.

19:43.457 --> 19:47.336
The poor man.
He was like a French realist painting.

19:47.336 --> 19:50.172
Nice to look at but nothing
below the surface.

19:50.172 --> 19:51.465
No core?

19:53.884 --> 19:57.847
We've been looking into his business
dealings. The gambling ship, for one.

19:58.390 --> 20:01.934
God, that disaster.
And his real estate issues.

20:02.560 --> 20:06.314
Well, the banks funding his stadium
project, they went belly up in '31,

20:06.314 --> 20:08.774
so he came to me hoping
I would step in.

20:09.483 --> 20:11.194
- Did you?
- Not a chance.

20:11.987 --> 20:15.197
Besides, he was trying to do it
behind his father's back.

20:15.574 --> 20:17.116
We have rules about that sort of thing.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.828
- Helps keep the peace?
- More than you know.

20:19.828 --> 20:21.996
What about San Haven
and what's there?

20:25.333 --> 20:27.877
No, no, Mr. Mason.

20:27.877 --> 20:31.130
I'll have a little fun with you,
but I don't traffic in tawdry rumors.

20:31.130 --> 20:32.673
We didn't mean to overstep.

20:32.673 --> 20:34.968
Then he should keep that folly
to himself.

20:34.968 --> 20:37.428
The Lawson girl's family has been
through quite enough.

20:37.428 --> 20:40.724
- Camilla, we do have that 11 o'clock.
- I'm aware.

20:41.307 --> 20:43.810
Della, we're having another concert
on the eighth.

20:43.810 --> 20:45.645
I'll make sure Phippsy has your address.

20:45.978 --> 20:46.938
Thank you.

20:48.189 --> 20:50.399
- Mr. Mason...
- Miss Nygaard.

20:50.399 --> 20:52.193
Thank you, Phippsy.

20:56.989 --> 21:00.659
- San Haven?
- The number I found in Brooks's wallet.

21:21.472 --> 21:24.308
- Can I help you find someone?
- Yes, Lawson.

21:26.311 --> 21:29.521
- Miss Lawson doesn't take visitors.
- I'm here in a legal capacity.

21:29.521 --> 21:32.025
I can't let you in
unless you're immediate family.

21:32.025 --> 21:35.736
Not according to the law.
Muldoon vs. Clearview Hospital 1916.

21:35.736 --> 21:37.655
Attorneys are
granted full access to meet with patients

21:37.655 --> 21:39.574
even when residing in privately
run facilities.

21:39.574 --> 21:43.286
I clerked for the justice who wrote
the opinion. I can get you a copy.

21:43.286 --> 21:45.496
Perhaps you should speak
with our administrator.

21:45.496 --> 21:47.539
- Excuse me for a minute.
- Sure.

22:34.712 --> 22:35.754
Miss Lawson?

22:37.507 --> 22:38.967
Miss Lawson?

23:48.243 --> 23:49.995
Miss Lawson, I'm sorry.

23:50.329 --> 23:51.748
Miss Lawson?

23:53.707 --> 23:55.168
Miss Lawson?

23:58.921 --> 23:59.881
Miss Lawson?

24:08.390 --> 24:11.559
Miss Lawson, I am sorry. Excuse me.

24:14.061 --> 24:17.982
- Sir! You're not supposed to be in here!
- I was just going.

24:17.982 --> 24:20.652
Maybe the Lawsons
are Brooks' in-laws.

24:20.652 --> 24:23.488
No, no, no, those are the... Claibornes.

24:23.488 --> 24:25.781
Della, try and run down
what you can on the Lawson woman.

24:25.781 --> 24:28.909
First name Noreen. Maybe thirty.
Brother's name starts with a V.

24:28.909 --> 24:32.622
Marion, run down what you can on a
Noreen Lawson, approximately thirty,

24:32.622 --> 24:34.665
and her brother,
first name starts with a V.

24:34.665 --> 24:36.251
With a V, got it.

24:39.713 --> 24:41.088
I've got other things to do.

24:43.257 --> 24:46.428
I'm headed to the Hooverville
to verify the brothers' timeline.

24:46.428 --> 24:49.763
- Make sure that it'll hold up.
- I want to focus on Holcomb.

24:49.763 --> 24:53.350
Do you really buy Holcomb killing
Brooks for losing him some money?

24:53.350 --> 24:55.728
Maybe it wasn't losing it.
Maybe it was getting it back

24:55.728 --> 24:58.063
'cause partnering in that boat
couldn't have been cheap.

24:58.063 --> 25:00.899
So Holcomb figures he gets
fuck-up Brooks out of the way

25:00.899 --> 25:04.529
and fixes up the situation himself.
Turns that place around.

25:04.529 --> 25:06.323
And he goes from owning half
the Morocco

25:06.323 --> 25:08.116
to owning all of it with one bullet.

25:08.116 --> 25:10.160
- It holds water, right?
- Yeah.

25:10.160 --> 25:13.996
So how does Holcomb set the
brothers up?

25:13.996 --> 25:15.415
Right, so...

25:17.542 --> 25:19.586
Holcomb sees Rafael and Mateo rummaging

25:19.586 --> 25:20.794
close to where he shot Brooks.

25:20.794 --> 25:24.882
And puts the wallet in a trashcan down
the way. Bingo, the brothers find it.

25:24.882 --> 25:27.009
Right, 'cause which kid grubbing
for a two-cent bottle

25:27.009 --> 25:28.802
isn't going to go for a
fancy billfold just sitting there?

25:28.802 --> 25:30.638
And the gold coin inside.

25:30.638 --> 25:33.057
And Holcomb knows
they're gonna pawn it,

25:33.057 --> 25:36.101
so it's only a matter of time
before the cops round 'em up

25:36.101 --> 25:38.563
and LA's got themselves
the perfect patsies.

25:38.563 --> 25:41.191
Two Mexican kids ready-made
to go from the front page to the gallows

25:41.191 --> 25:42.275
in ten seconds flat.

25:43.192 --> 25:44.526
I don't buy it.

25:47.280 --> 25:50.367
- Why not?
- We can't prove Holcomb did any of it.

25:50.991 --> 25:53.369
Can't prove he put anything
in a garbage can

25:53.369 --> 25:56.413
or wanted to take over the Morocco
or had anything to do with the murder.

25:56.413 --> 25:58.499
But it's reasonable doubt.
Just planting a seed.

25:58.499 --> 26:00.252
Milligan will rip it apart.

26:01.503 --> 26:04.004
- Excuse me. Mr. Mason...
- Yeah?

26:04.004 --> 26:06.340
- Linda's on the phone.
- Thank you.

26:07.259 --> 26:09.094
You're a real wet blanket,
you know that?

26:09.094 --> 26:11.595
Make a better case, and I won't be.

26:24.484 --> 26:26.986
- I won.
- No, you didn't. Another round.

26:36.705 --> 26:37.789
What?

26:38.540 --> 26:42.876
Is this how it's gonna be...
you know, until we...

26:42.876 --> 26:44.420
Don't think about it.

26:51.969 --> 26:54.388
You already owe me six cigarettes.

26:59.227 --> 27:01.730
Switch. That doesn't count.
Let's play again.

27:01.730 --> 27:06.066
No, no, no, let's go again, but this
time, I'm on this side. Here you go.

27:07.651 --> 27:08.986
I'll take that.

27:11.740 --> 27:13.283
What's that noise?

27:16.578 --> 27:19.289
You really think
that was going to work?

27:19.289 --> 27:20.582
I'm not losing another round.

27:20.582 --> 27:22.791
Then you need to learn to toss better
than a fucking gorilla.

27:46.066 --> 27:49.026
Ma'am, do you happen to know
the Gallardos?

27:49.568 --> 27:50.903
No, I sure don't.

28:03.333 --> 28:05.292
Steady. There he is!

28:06.043 --> 28:07.544
Over there!

28:08.420 --> 28:09.756
Hey there.

28:09.756 --> 28:12.800
Okay! Lower that down for me.
Thank you, sweetheart.

28:13.260 --> 28:16.679
We're just shooting the rats for supper.
We're allowed.

28:16.679 --> 28:21.183
- You are. But where'd you get that?
- Found a dime and rented it.

28:22.352 --> 28:24.145
Who rents guns?

28:29.483 --> 28:31.318
That's him in the hat.

28:32.737 --> 28:33.862
Thanks.

28:34.531 --> 28:36.074
Come on.

28:38.367 --> 28:41.871
Do you live with anyone?
A dad, an uncle, grandpa?

28:42.330 --> 28:44.499
- Our Pops.
- What's his name?

28:45.000 --> 28:47.501
- Eustis.
- Eustis what?

28:48.002 --> 28:49.921
You got another nickel?

29:16.405 --> 29:18.198
I hear you're a man to see.

29:20.952 --> 29:24.246
- Depends on where you heard it.
- Fella, Eustis Beck.

29:40.513 --> 29:41.765
Whatcha looking for?

29:42.140 --> 29:45.518
Nothing too big. Maybe a .32.

29:53.108 --> 29:54.485
Take your pick.

29:58.198 --> 30:01.576
- How much for a whole day?
- Dollar, with full chambers.

30:05.247 --> 30:07.998
Here's a Lincoln for all five of 'em.

30:09.709 --> 30:11.418
All yours, killer.

30:19.718 --> 30:23.515
Hey, don'tcha want to know
what I want 'em for?

30:24.516 --> 30:28.602
You want all five of those for the day, I
sure as hell don't want to know why.

30:29.020 --> 30:32.481
And don't come back here
and fucking tell me neither.

30:53.168 --> 30:55.504
- Hi.
- Hi.

30:56.423 --> 30:59.968
- Come on in.
- I'm sorry this is so last-minute.

31:01.595 --> 31:03.888
Thank you. I had a chance
to restack at the library,

31:03.888 --> 31:07.851
and if I do an overnight,
then I get an extra day off this summer.

31:07.851 --> 31:09.768
It's just for one night.

31:12.896 --> 31:17.485
Just like the Army.
What do you think, Captain?

31:19.821 --> 31:21.615
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

31:24.492 --> 31:26.870
- Why don't you go take a look?
- Yeah.

31:29.830 --> 31:33.668
Sorry. He just needs a minute
to warm up.

31:33.668 --> 31:35.336
Yeah, of course.

31:35.712 --> 31:40.090
So, is the tent because you didn't have
any actual furniture?

31:40.090 --> 31:43.636
No. Maybe it's just fun. Yeah.

31:44.219 --> 31:46.263
- I brought groceries.
- Don't need them.

31:46.681 --> 31:49.559
Stopped off at the market.
Yep, welcome to the Mess.

31:49.559 --> 31:51.353
- Beans?
- Yes.

31:51.353 --> 31:54.938
The real trick to a group of men
sitting around eating beans

31:54.938 --> 31:56.482
is that they actually do it outdoors.

31:56.982 --> 32:01.071
You realize you insulted me less when
we were married. I know how to do this.

32:01.821 --> 32:05.366
I'm sorry. I appreciate it. I do.

32:06.367 --> 32:10.079
And moving back to L.A.
was not exactly what he wanted.

32:10.872 --> 32:15.335
I was actually hoping that he might get
to know his father a little bit better.

32:16.711 --> 32:17.963
Of course.

32:20.257 --> 32:25.845
Well, I should go. Teddy, I have to go.
Give me a hug.

32:26.387 --> 32:30.099
- Do you have to?
- It's just for one night, okay?

32:30.433 --> 32:32.102
I am gonna call you in the morning,

32:32.102 --> 32:34.728
and he just needs to be at school
by eight o'clock.

32:34.728 --> 32:35.939
Got it.

32:41.068 --> 32:42.861
- Good luck stacking.
- Thank you. Oh, thank you.

32:42.861 --> 32:44.446
Enjoy. Bye.

32:48.033 --> 32:52.581
So, l know it's not your birthday
for a couple months,

32:53.330 --> 33:00.087
but a guy in the store said this
is top of the line. You just pull down.

33:02.007 --> 33:03.215
A Lionel Electric!

33:03.215 --> 33:07.762
Yes, there's even a secret switch
so you can steer it onto a second track.

33:08.387 --> 33:11.641
Want to set it up right now?
How about over by the tent?

33:11.641 --> 33:16.396
- But I have to do my homework first.
- What? It's still early.

33:19.691 --> 33:23.361
You know what? You do your
homework. We'll set this up after.

33:23.361 --> 33:24.820
- How about that?
- Okay.

33:36.624 --> 33:38.125
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah.

33:38.125 --> 33:42.964
- You know any Latin?
- We use a lot of it for legal terms.

33:43.339 --> 33:49.136
Okay, I need to conjugate "gaudere."
It means to be joyful.

33:49.887 --> 33:54.767
"Gaudeo, gaudes,
gaudet, gaudemus, gaudent."

33:55.100 --> 33:57.936
"But is the second-person plural
gaudetis"?

34:00.230 --> 34:01.899
You want to go see a movie?

34:17.289 --> 34:20.584
We've been holding back production
on these eight pumpers,

34:20.584 --> 34:23.296
but demand is coming back,
and we're gonna need the supply,

34:23.296 --> 34:26.508
so let's open up the taps
and let 'em run.

34:26.508 --> 34:30.720
Mr. McCutcheon, this fella says
he's got an appointment with you.

34:31.095 --> 34:35.724
Name's Dick Rile, sir. I was doing
some business with your late son.

34:37.978 --> 34:39.312
Give us a minute.

34:41.480 --> 34:44.108
I'm sorry to trouble you with this,
so soon and all,

34:44.108 --> 34:47.444
but Brooks hadn't paid me
in a couple months.

34:47.821 --> 34:50.281
Two hundred and forty dollars exact.

34:51.156 --> 34:55.327
We didn't have nothin' written, so I
figured you were the fella to see now.

34:56.496 --> 35:01.126
It's fine, Mr. Rile. Business
must always be settled, debts paid.

35:02.084 --> 35:06.590
Now, before I settle my son's accounts,
I want assurances from you.

35:06.590 --> 35:08.174
- Assurances?
- Yes.

35:08.841 --> 35:11.636
That if anyone ever asks you
anything regarding my son,

35:11.636 --> 35:14.263
you say you never had
a lick of business with him.

35:14.263 --> 35:19.059
- l was never gonna say nothin'.
- But you called me. Left messages.

35:19.852 --> 35:23.689
Showed up here. Not saying nothing
means it never passes your lips.

35:23.689 --> 35:29.153
You can never think it because it is gone
from your mind forever. Gone forever.

35:29.153 --> 35:32.908
- l understand.
- I hope you do, but I have to be certain.

35:50.300 --> 35:53.218
I believe my son's been made good,
Mr. Rile.

36:00.643 --> 36:02.686
Come on, Rile. Get up.

36:14.908 --> 36:16.326
All right.

36:20.997 --> 36:23.208
- Good morning, Teddy.
- Good morning, Miss Aimes.

36:23.667 --> 36:27.379
Look, I said I'll speak to her,
and you won't get in trouble.

36:28.380 --> 36:30.924
I don't think we have any rules

36:30.924 --> 36:33.384
about bringing your son to school
on a motorbike.

36:33.384 --> 36:37.471
Though you are getting quite an eyeful
from some of the other parents.

36:37.471 --> 36:41.434
Yeah, look,
Teddy didn't finish his homework.

36:42.851 --> 36:47.940
He stayed the night at my place last
night. Have a great day, bud.

36:48.607 --> 36:53.779
- Bye, Dad.
- Yeah, Linda and I divorced.

36:56.282 --> 37:01.371
Teddy shows no sign of it. And
the other children don't seem to know.

37:01.371 --> 37:06.625
I'm sure Linda would like it if you helped
keep it that way. For Teddy.

37:07.209 --> 37:08.877
Of course. I understand.

37:08.877 --> 37:10.589
It was just his first night
at my apartment.

37:10.589 --> 37:12.841
I wanted him to have fun,
so I took him to the movies.

37:12.841 --> 37:15.969
- What did you see?
- King Kong.

37:17.761 --> 37:20.264
Were there no burlesque houses open
for you to take him to?

37:20.264 --> 37:21.558
I'm glad you find it funny

37:21.558 --> 37:24.351
'cause that fucking dinosaur fight
gave him nightmares.

37:24.351 --> 37:25.770
Pardon my language.

37:26.645 --> 37:30.442
I won't hold it against you...
the language or the movie choice.

37:31.943 --> 37:34.613
And I'll tell Teddy he
can make up his homework tonight.

37:36.114 --> 37:39.200
Good morning, Vanessa.
One, two, three, four, six...

38:17.571 --> 38:19.782
- Morning, Marion.
- Mr. Mason...

38:20.492 --> 38:22.451
They wouldn't sign in.

38:45.224 --> 38:46.767
If you wanted to speak with me, McCutcheon,

38:46.767 --> 38:48.936
you could've picked up a phone.

38:49.478 --> 38:52.399
If I had wanted to pick up a phone,
I would have.

38:53.524 --> 38:54.943
What do you want?

38:54.943 --> 38:59.155
Mason Dairy,
that was your family's farm, wasn't it?

39:00.657 --> 39:01.700
Yeah.

39:02.284 --> 39:04.369
Then you must appreciate
a good horse.

39:05.077 --> 39:07.914
Maybe you don't know much
about where milk comes from.

39:07.914 --> 39:10.374
Pull on a horse, you're in trouble.

39:13.044 --> 39:16.881
Some of my fondest memories of me
and Brooks are on horseback.

39:18.925 --> 39:21.386
Riding is a fine thing
to pass on to a son.

39:26.390 --> 39:28.100
Why did you take this case?

39:29.311 --> 39:32.146
You were doing fine
in your little niche practice.

39:33.898 --> 39:35.941
Maybe I like stacked odds.

39:37.526 --> 39:40.280
You've been digging
into my son's affairs.

39:41.614 --> 39:46.201
Well, I'd like you to consider finding
another hole to dig in.

39:46.201 --> 39:47.495
What hole do you suggest?

39:47.870 --> 39:51.207
Any one that isn't full of mud
to drag his good name through.

39:51.540 --> 39:52.751
You have to understand

39:52.751 --> 39:57.630
what Brooks's death has done to his
widow, his children...

39:59.715 --> 40:03.010
frankly, what it's done to me.

40:11.810 --> 40:15.522
There were other versions of my son,
as there are other versions of all of us.

40:15.522 --> 40:18.651
Is there a version
that includes Noreen Lawson?

40:25.991 --> 40:29.620
I've encountered many people like you
in my life, Mr. Mason.

40:30.537 --> 40:36.293
The chip on the shoulder.
The great savior. Martyr to the cause.

40:36.293 --> 40:38.672
I just see it as making things fair.

40:40.674 --> 40:43.385
You think by getting
the Gallardo boys off,

40:43.385 --> 40:47.097
their life will take some remarkable
turn toward success?

40:48.056 --> 40:51.392
I think we both know
with you that the opposite is true.

40:54.520 --> 40:59.858
That poor Emily Dodson girl.
All you went through for her.

41:01.277 --> 41:02.444
Jail was where she really belonged,

41:02.444 --> 41:06.866
but instead, you worked tirelessly
to have her set free, and for what?

41:07.867 --> 41:11.203
Just so she could walk
into Lake Tahoe?

41:17.711 --> 41:20.964
Even when you win,
Mr. Mason, you lose,

41:21.423 --> 41:24.717
and in the end,
what are you left with?

41:28.971 --> 41:31.266
Emily might have disappointed me,

41:32.475 --> 41:34.601
but with all his breeding
and advantages,

41:34.601 --> 41:38.523
just remember I'm standing here
because of who disappointed you.

41:38.523 --> 41:42.360
Keep digging into my son,
and I will burn you.

41:43.904 --> 41:46.031
And no one will give a damn.

41:47.908 --> 41:49.034
You can go.

43:25.547 --> 43:26.880
What?

44:12.928 --> 44:15.804
- When did you find out?
- About three months ago.

44:20.310 --> 44:22.395
Why didn't you tell me?

44:24.940 --> 44:28.485
I don't know. I don't.

44:30.612 --> 44:34.449
Those postcards
started showing up a while back,

44:34.449 --> 44:37.452
and I just thought it was her ranting.

44:38.536 --> 44:43.958
- What was I supposed to do?
- You're the one she reached out to.

44:44.500 --> 44:48.380
Yeah, and why do that to me?
Why do that to anyone?

44:48.754 --> 44:51.132
Tell them you're going to kill yourself
to be together with your kid again.

44:51.132 --> 44:53.677
Call a head shrinker, not your lawyer.

44:53.677 --> 44:56.137
You could have called one for her.

45:06.523 --> 45:11.945
You don't think that's all I do is think
about what I should've done?

45:13.321 --> 45:17.324
l should've gone up there. I should've. I
should've stopped her. I should've...

45:17.324 --> 45:20.328
Maybe I could've shaken
some sense into her.

45:24.748 --> 45:29.004
- You were never going to do that.
- Yes, but l might have.

45:32.381 --> 45:35.592
Della, I never thought
she would go through with it.

45:38.137 --> 45:39.556
Jesus, Perry,

45:41.474 --> 45:44.393
so that's what we've been
doing all this time?

45:45.561 --> 45:50.567
Giving up criminal cases,
me walking on eggshells,

45:52.527 --> 45:55.196
all because you're torn up about Emily.

46:01.118 --> 46:04.122
For fuck's sake, Perry,
you should've told me.

46:07.416 --> 46:11.171
When I said we're in this together,
I meant it. We're partners.

46:13.381 --> 46:16.092
But when are you ever
not alone in anything?

46:23.266 --> 46:24.851
I'm sorry.

46:39.991 --> 46:41.700
Leave 'em on the bed.

46:45.163 --> 46:47.539
You rent this gun to these boys?

46:56.298 --> 46:58.301
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

46:58.760 --> 47:02.096
That's not the answer I wanted.
Not by a damn sight.

47:16.151 --> 47:18.071
Now, I'm gonna keep those other .32s.

47:18.071 --> 47:20.198
I'm gonna call that
your cost of doing business.

47:20.198 --> 47:21.949
Get the fuck out.

47:49.227 --> 47:50.937
Fuck.
