WEBVTT

00:00.581 --> 00:03.224
I will persuade Ferrante
no alliance with Sixtus

00:03.225 --> 00:05.493
ever benefits
the Pope's partners.

00:05.561 --> 00:07.729
You seek an alliance
against Florence?

00:07.797 --> 00:09.164
How may we be of service?

00:09.231 --> 00:12.867
We will apply
unrelenting pressure

00:12.935 --> 00:14.903
until Lorenzo surrenders.

00:14.971 --> 00:18.540
You carry Giuliano's seed?
Yes, signora.

00:18.607 --> 00:20.809
So you will remain
with us.

00:20.876 --> 00:22.978
Are we on the right course?
We've been at sea for weeks.

00:23.045 --> 00:25.280
That, together with
this device,

00:25.348 --> 00:27.515
enabled me to estimate
the length of our voyage.

00:27.583 --> 00:29.017
If you're wrong,
we die at sea.

00:29.085 --> 00:30.518
We will not die at sea.

00:30.586 --> 00:32.554
What are you
teaching the boy?

00:32.621 --> 00:35.290
How to survive
when grace fails.

00:35.358 --> 00:37.826
This ship will sink without
Da Vinci at the helm.

00:37.893 --> 00:41.563
Storm on the way, Your Grace.
Could push us into the rocks.

00:42.531 --> 00:43.965
Let me out, please!

02:18.184 --> 02:19.517
Out you get.

02:28.794 --> 02:30.128
Dry land.

02:46.512 --> 02:49.681
Count Riario didn't pray
to his God hard enough.

03:11.704 --> 03:14.306
This is not how I saw us
finding your New World.

03:19.245 --> 03:20.945
The light here is different.

03:24.950 --> 03:28.019
The rock striations,
the lush vegetation.

03:28.087 --> 03:30.989
We need food, Leo.

03:31.057 --> 03:32.991
It's remarkable.

03:35.027 --> 03:38.229
This could be the gateway
to extraordinary things.

03:43.269 --> 03:45.637
That's the figurehead
of the Basilisk.

03:45.705 --> 03:47.672
One sailor to another.

03:47.740 --> 03:49.741
No one survived this wreck.

03:49.809 --> 03:51.843
We can't write them
off as dead.

03:51.911 --> 03:54.106
Parts of the Basilisk
made it to the shore,

03:54.131 --> 03:55.347
maybe survivors did as well.

03:55.348 --> 03:58.683
If Riario survived, he'll have
weeks of advantage on us.

04:00.986 --> 04:03.121
And he'll have taken
Nico with him.

04:12.832 --> 04:17.902
I'll stay aboard with Captain
and chart these shores.

04:17.970 --> 04:22.005
There's more money in making a map
to treasure than in searching for it.

04:22.074 --> 04:25.043
Amerigo, we will return to
this shore in three months.

04:25.111 --> 04:28.213
Do you swear to be here
for us then?

04:28.280 --> 04:31.015
And if your motley assemblage
doesn't come back,

04:31.083 --> 04:33.618
I'm to wait here on
this beach, cock in hand?

04:33.686 --> 04:36.121
It's the perfect place
to tan your tiny prick.

04:36.188 --> 04:38.323
If we don't return by then,
sail without us.

04:40.760 --> 04:42.260
I'll mourn you...

04:42.328 --> 04:44.829
as I'm celebrated
for discovering this land.

04:44.897 --> 04:47.866
Of course you'll take the credit,
you buzzard's canker sore.

04:47.933 --> 04:48.967
Bye-bye.

04:50.903 --> 04:52.871
Maybe I will.

04:52.938 --> 04:56.975
Maybe I'll name this whole
fucking place after myself!

04:58.210 --> 05:01.079
Vespuccia!

05:01.147 --> 05:03.715
Vespuccia!

05:15.394 --> 05:17.796
Urgh! Argh!

05:19.732 --> 05:23.134
And I used to love
visiting Naples.

05:25.738 --> 05:27.705
A word, please, Officer.

05:27.773 --> 05:30.341
Shut it, shit-slinger, I'm
trying to take a head count.

05:30.409 --> 05:31.686
All the while we've been here,

05:31.711 --> 05:34.027
we've not been given
a chance to state our case.

05:34.046 --> 05:36.514
What case? Aren't you the
two they found burying bodies

05:36.582 --> 05:37.749
with that chest
of gold?

05:37.817 --> 05:40.118
It was our gold, we acted
in our own defense.

05:40.186 --> 05:43.054
Of course you did!
We are emissaries from Milan

05:43.122 --> 05:47.225
with a vital message from
Ludovico Sforza for his sister Ippolita.

05:47.293 --> 05:50.995
Duke Alfonso's wife?

05:51.063 --> 05:53.565
Two paupers like yourselves
don't come bearing nothing

05:53.632 --> 05:54.699
but cock rash.

05:54.767 --> 05:56.801
We rode incognito
to elude bandits.

05:56.869 --> 05:59.170
Now, here's something
you should see.

06:02.208 --> 06:04.242
Didn't they search you
on the way in?

06:04.310 --> 06:07.378
Inform the Duchess that we are
here on urgent business.

06:13.752 --> 06:17.689
My name is Gallus and this
is my companion Daphnis.

06:17.756 --> 06:20.658
The Duchess will know
who we are.

06:29.335 --> 06:30.668
They made us disrobe.

06:30.736 --> 06:35.206
Where exactly
were you hiding that?

06:35.274 --> 06:36.541
Medici trade secret.

06:40.212 --> 06:42.180
I miss the city,
maestro.

06:42.248 --> 06:45.650
This palace lacks
Florence's vitality.

06:45.718 --> 06:48.820
It feels an eternity I've been
trapped in this stale place.

06:48.888 --> 06:50.722
Stale?

06:50.789 --> 06:52.657
When this home
was constructed,

06:52.725 --> 06:57.095
Cosimo employed Michelozzo
to design unique flourishes -

06:57.162 --> 07:01.699
hidden passages, spy holes,
coded messages.

07:01.767 --> 07:04.202
For instance...

07:04.270 --> 07:07.038
..if you stand in that corner

07:07.106 --> 07:10.475
I'll show you
one of my favorites.

07:12.444 --> 07:14.712
So this Benedetto,

07:14.780 --> 07:16.820
what exactly does he
do in your workshop,

07:16.845 --> 07:18.249
other than look handsome?

07:18.250 --> 07:20.952
He's a framer for one
of my latest commissions.

07:21.020 --> 07:24.689
And you find no
other uses for him?

07:24.757 --> 07:29.227
Now...listen.

07:31.230 --> 07:34.933
Vanessa, can
we talk Andrea into shaving that beard?

07:35.000 --> 07:37.869
It bristles against my skin.

07:37.937 --> 07:39.737
I heard him
as though he was next to me!

07:39.805 --> 07:41.773
How is this possible?

07:41.840 --> 07:43.374
It's called
a whisper corridor.

07:43.442 --> 07:46.978
The circular construction allows
sound to travel perfectly,

07:47.046 --> 07:50.114
from one precise location
to another.

07:50.182 --> 07:52.951
Walls that talk.

07:53.018 --> 07:54.619
Amazing!

07:56.055 --> 07:58.957
Signor Sassetti,
I promised the captain funds

07:59.024 --> 08:01.025
for the hiring
of more officers.

08:01.093 --> 08:03.094
What gives you the right
to turn him away?

08:03.162 --> 08:05.296
My title.

08:05.364 --> 08:07.398
As general manager
of the Medici Bank,

08:07.466 --> 08:09.634
its solvency
is my solemn duty.

08:09.702 --> 08:12.236
I cannot approve another
loan to a government

08:12.304 --> 08:14.672
which already holds
significant debts.

08:14.740 --> 08:16.703
This is not a loan but

08:16.728 --> 08:18.943
a simple withdrawal of
Medici family assets.

08:18.944 --> 08:20.144
Another request
I must deny.

08:20.212 --> 08:23.948
You may not realize that as your
husband left for Naples,

08:24.016 --> 08:26.618
he withdrew an enormous
sum from our coffers.

08:26.685 --> 08:30.722
I must insist all accounts
suspended...

08:30.789 --> 08:33.224
until debts
are reasonably repaid.

08:33.292 --> 08:35.226
As I insist you resign.

08:35.294 --> 08:39.130
A majority of the board must
approve executive hiring.

08:39.198 --> 08:40.365
Or firing.

08:40.432 --> 08:44.135
If Lorenzo were here...
But he's not, is he?

08:44.203 --> 08:47.872
Instead, shortly after
losing his mistress,

08:47.940 --> 08:49.907
he heads to Naples...

08:49.975 --> 08:52.276
a land which,
by staggering coincidence,

08:52.344 --> 08:54.312
is home to his first love,

08:54.380 --> 08:58.716
Ippolita Sforza,
the Duchess of Calabria.

08:58.784 --> 09:00.284
In such an absence,

09:00.352 --> 09:03.388
you cannot blame us for
doing what we think best.

09:42.261 --> 09:43.561
Fuck.

09:45.163 --> 09:47.131
It really is a new world.

09:47.199 --> 09:50.268
I haven't had this much fluid sucked out
of me since that girl in Beretola.

09:50.335 --> 09:52.303
In all my years as a painter,

09:52.371 --> 09:55.406
I've never seen a vermillion
like this.

09:55.474 --> 09:57.074
Really?

09:57.142 --> 09:58.409
Leo, not bothered by the howling
beasts in the trees

09:58.477 --> 10:01.012
but a new color?
Yes, that gives you pause.

10:01.079 --> 10:02.380
Prick.

10:10.956 --> 10:12.924
Da Vinci?

10:12.991 --> 10:14.959
Look at the finishing
of this.

10:15.027 --> 10:17.461
It's pure gold.

10:21.133 --> 10:23.267
Shit.

10:32.077 --> 10:33.210
We are on track.

10:33.278 --> 10:35.880
But the people here,

10:35.948 --> 10:37.748
they just leave out gold
for the taking.

10:39.418 --> 10:42.920
What are you doing?
We haven't been paid since Genoa.

10:42.988 --> 10:45.189
I promise you payment in
abundance on our return to Florence.

10:45.257 --> 10:48.025
But not if you disturb what is
clearly a sacred idol.

10:53.332 --> 10:55.032
Hey, hey.

10:56.735 --> 10:58.269
We're friends. Friends.

10:59.938 --> 11:01.372
Keep still.

11:01.440 --> 11:03.074
We're visitors.

11:03.141 --> 11:06.577
We seek men...

11:06.645 --> 11:09.513
..like ourselves.

11:09.581 --> 11:12.917
Primitive.
He may think the same of us.

11:14.252 --> 11:16.554
Wait, wait! Wait!

11:20.993 --> 11:25.196
Brilliant! That's brilliant.

11:25.263 --> 11:27.398
You raise weapons,
he tells his people,

11:27.466 --> 11:34.005
and we've made an enemy before
we've even spoken a word.

11:34.072 --> 11:36.040
Thank you...

11:36.108 --> 11:42.113
T-Thank you so much
for your steady nerve!

11:42.180 --> 11:43.981
We press on.

11:44.049 --> 11:46.250
But keep your blades ready

11:46.318 --> 11:49.653
for the fight
that you may have handed us.

11:54.359 --> 11:55.926
Shit.

12:09.241 --> 12:10.961
You lied about us being
Milanese emissaries.

12:10.976 --> 12:16.347
They're most likely choosing
the piazza to display our corpses.

12:17.382 --> 12:20.151
Lorenzo?

12:20.218 --> 12:23.854
Lorenzo!
Ippolita.

12:23.922 --> 12:27.224
Lucifer himself would
call you a holy fool for coming here.

12:27.292 --> 12:30.461
I had no other choice.

12:30.529 --> 12:33.297
Gallus and Daphnis?

12:33.365 --> 12:35.499
The names of the lovers
in Eclogue Ten.

12:35.567 --> 12:38.102
I knew you would remember.

12:38.170 --> 12:40.104
How could I forget?

12:40.172 --> 12:44.141
On the banks of the River Po,
reading all Virgil's verses.

12:44.209 --> 12:48.446
We rarely finished.

12:48.513 --> 12:51.882
And to think I lost you...

12:51.950 --> 12:58.255
..to that Roman woman
and the Orsini name.

12:58.323 --> 13:02.126
Clarice...has her virtues.

13:02.194 --> 13:05.329
Ah.
Do you read poetry together?

13:09.534 --> 13:11.469
As we speak,

13:11.536 --> 13:14.505
she watches over my republic

13:14.573 --> 13:17.475
as your husband brandishes
arms against it.

13:17.542 --> 13:19.310
I tried.

13:19.377 --> 13:21.812
I pleaded for him
not to move against you.

13:21.880 --> 13:23.814
After the attack
on your family...

13:23.882 --> 13:25.850
Poor Giuliano.

13:25.917 --> 13:28.919
I cannot bear
the thought of Alfonso

13:28.987 --> 13:30.688
bringing more death
to Florence.

13:30.755 --> 13:31.989
Your husband
is a warrior.

13:32.057 --> 13:34.024
He takes up weapons
as automatically

13:34.092 --> 13:35.860
as a child handles
a plaything.

13:35.927 --> 13:39.163
That is why we are here,
Your Grace, to speak with King Ferrante.

13:39.231 --> 13:40.998
My father-in-law
will not listen.

13:41.066 --> 13:42.199
He is...

13:42.267 --> 13:44.235
Just like a Florentine,

13:44.302 --> 13:46.270
to enter from the back door.

13:46.338 --> 13:47.438
Alfonso.

13:47.506 --> 13:50.007
Lorenzo has come to meet
with your father.

13:50.075 --> 13:52.910
I had hoped to act
as an intermediary.

13:52.978 --> 13:54.478
Of course.

13:54.546 --> 14:00.417
That must be why you came here
without a royal escort.

14:00.485 --> 14:02.453
It wasn't her idea, Alfonso.

14:02.521 --> 14:06.257
I called upon her to...
come to me alone.

14:06.324 --> 14:09.727
You dare enter Naples
unannounced

14:09.794 --> 14:11.695
and meet with my wife
in secret?

14:11.763 --> 14:16.767
Alfonso, I...
Duke Alfonso.

14:16.835 --> 14:21.005
I...implore you...

14:21.072 --> 14:27.077
..let me sit with your father
and end this pointless war.

14:31.116 --> 14:33.317
Of course.

14:33.385 --> 14:36.487
Of course I will take you
to my father.

14:36.555 --> 14:41.325
We are...civilized
heads of state.

14:41.393 --> 14:42.927
Are we not?

15:01.680 --> 15:02.846
<i>Trouble sleeping?</i>

15:05.784 --> 15:08.752
I'm at your mercy, my lady.

15:08.820 --> 15:11.855
I only seek a discussion
away from prying ears.

15:11.923 --> 15:14.191
And what if someone
saw you enter?

15:14.259 --> 15:16.493
I took precautions.

15:16.561 --> 15:18.762
I would never risk
your dignity.

15:23.835 --> 15:28.472
Henbane, bark of mandrake
and juice of lettuce.

15:28.540 --> 15:33.143
An ineffective potion against
the restless sleep of leadership.

15:33.211 --> 15:34.778
But a necessary one.

15:34.846 --> 15:36.814
Other leaders of this family
have found relief

15:36.881 --> 15:38.015
in distractions
of the flesh.

15:38.083 --> 15:41.218
I need no schooling
in my husband's habits.

15:41.286 --> 15:42.753
What do you want?

15:42.821 --> 15:46.390
To offer assistance with
Portinari and Sassetti.

15:46.458 --> 15:48.459
Their scheming
is obvious.

15:48.526 --> 15:50.928
I need no help with greedy
jackals, I grew up in Rome.

15:50.996 --> 15:52.322
I wish to make sure they

15:52.347 --> 15:54.832
take no advantage of what
they perceive as weakness.

15:54.833 --> 15:57.201
They were trained
by my father.

15:57.269 --> 16:01.505
Cosimo demanded a certain
ruthlessness in those he employed.

16:01.573 --> 16:04.975
And I will gladly
respond in kind.

16:05.043 --> 16:10.814
Consider
their perspective.

16:10.882 --> 16:13.150
They believe the bank weak
with a woman at its head,

16:13.218 --> 16:16.487
akin to how my father denied me
a place in its management.

16:16.554 --> 16:18.555
You were illegitimate.

16:18.623 --> 16:20.057
A bastard...

16:20.125 --> 16:22.459
with an unsuitable
complexion.

16:24.396 --> 16:29.466
Almost as bad
as being a woman.

16:29.534 --> 16:31.502
So you'd like an alliance...

16:31.569 --> 16:36.373
a seat on the Medici Bank board
after all these years.

16:36.441 --> 16:39.410
Giuliano's seat
remains vacant.

16:39.477 --> 16:42.646
<i>You're as clever</i>
<i>as you are beautiful.</i>

16:44.849 --> 16:48.585
Don't waste your time
flattering me.

16:48.653 --> 16:49.920
Appoint me...

16:49.988 --> 16:53.157
..and I vote with you
on all matters.

17:01.966 --> 17:05.402
A bastard and a woman.

17:05.470 --> 17:07.671
Quite the partnership.

17:11.476 --> 17:14.178
Good night, signor.

17:34.232 --> 17:36.834
Shit.

17:36.901 --> 17:40.738
This is the work of
civilization.

17:41.806 --> 17:43.774
Ah, fuck!

17:43.842 --> 17:46.276
Normally, I like things
hot and wet.

17:46.344 --> 17:49.012
We're on the right path.

17:50.982 --> 17:53.751
We should make camp.
Yeah, why not?

18:38.263 --> 18:39.363
Whoa.

18:56.481 --> 18:59.516
They're just...

19:08.993 --> 19:11.195
Look.

19:11.262 --> 19:13.230
Look, these symbols.

19:13.298 --> 19:16.433
Do you see?

19:16.501 --> 19:18.302
It's the same.

19:19.804 --> 19:23.040
Friends.

19:23.107 --> 19:27.077
In the name of the Father, Son
and Holy Ghost, amen.

19:27.145 --> 19:29.480
Where is he?

19:37.355 --> 19:39.423
Carlo.

19:39.491 --> 19:43.160
I must commend your powers
of persuasion.

19:43.228 --> 19:47.464
Clarice has officially nominated
you to fill Giuliano's seat on the board.

19:47.532 --> 19:48.799
As I assured you she would.

19:48.867 --> 19:51.468
This maneuver does nothing
to solve our problem.

19:51.536 --> 19:55.606
Clarice still holds over
half the board in her palm.

19:55.673 --> 19:58.208
That will change with time and
persistence.

19:58.276 --> 19:59.510
The time to act is now.

19:59.577 --> 20:03.247
Lorenzo and Clarice still hold
the favor of the people.

20:03.314 --> 20:05.282
And what if we replaced her

20:05.350 --> 20:11.154
with someone we could sell
as Lorenzo's choice?

20:11.222 --> 20:13.924
With the same name.

20:13.992 --> 20:15.392
Our plan is my succession.

20:15.460 --> 20:17.361
Your plan is taking too long.

20:17.428 --> 20:20.831
For your creditors...
Enough.

20:20.899 --> 20:22.299
What is your proposition?

20:28.506 --> 20:31.875
This letter, penned by King
Ferdinand of Aragon himself,

20:31.943 --> 20:33.911
details, at my suggestion,

20:33.978 --> 20:38.315
his intention to default
on all loans from the Medici Bank

20:38.383 --> 20:43.053
unless Clarice
is removed from leadership.

20:43.121 --> 20:45.789
Spain is our largest account.

20:45.857 --> 20:47.758
How does this aid our cause?

20:47.825 --> 20:51.194
I negotiated a steady repayment
schedule...

20:51.262 --> 20:54.264
..with a slight reduction
in interest,

20:54.332 --> 20:58.802
once Carlo takes control
of the bank.

20:58.870 --> 20:59.937
Is this true?

21:00.004 --> 21:03.373
A Medici Bank
run by a Medici.

21:03.441 --> 21:07.578
But without the embarrassment
of a woman at its head.

21:25.830 --> 21:29.299
Even Signor Rinaldi has
indicated he will vote with us.

21:29.367 --> 21:32.970
Albini teeters,
but can be swayed.

21:33.037 --> 21:35.539
Be sure to emphasize
Carlo's role in this.

21:35.607 --> 21:37.574
It will ensure their support.

21:37.642 --> 21:40.310
Clarice will be out of
the picture soon enough.

22:04.769 --> 22:06.903
Leo, they're going to
fucking kill us.

22:06.971 --> 22:08.338
No.

22:08.406 --> 22:11.008
They've fed us, they've
transported us for miles.

22:11.075 --> 22:12.442
They've got something
else in mind.

22:12.510 --> 22:14.071
Yeah, being
their next meal.

22:15.880 --> 22:17.848
This is an advanced people, Zo.

22:17.915 --> 22:19.883
Take their language.

22:19.951 --> 22:22.252
Leo, please tell me you're
trying to find a way to escape,

22:22.320 --> 22:23.754
not just decipher
their gibberish.

22:23.821 --> 22:26.289
Ssh.

22:28.059 --> 22:32.262
Listen. Every sound they make
is a key to the puzzle of their tongue.

22:32.330 --> 22:36.333
The leader keeps referring to
himself as "noqa" for "I"

22:36.401 --> 22:38.435
and "noqanchik"
for "us as a group".

22:38.503 --> 22:40.203
Obviously.
Yeah.

22:42.073 --> 22:46.043
I've repeatedly heard the word
"puriy" and "purinchik"

22:46.110 --> 22:49.079
to describe an action that's
occurred throughout the time

22:49.147 --> 22:50.647
that we've been with them.

22:52.083 --> 22:56.953
It translates as "walk"
and "we walk".

23:04.295 --> 23:06.263
Making friends, are we?

23:07.432 --> 23:10.901
That word, "yawar".

23:10.968 --> 23:15.806
They used it when they fed us
the llama milk mixed with blood.

23:15.873 --> 23:17.841
Please mean milk.

23:17.909 --> 23:21.745
Uh...no, it suggests we may be
marching to our death after all.

23:29.654 --> 23:33.056
Oh.

23:33.124 --> 23:36.526
I do not claim to be
a wine cognoscente,

23:36.594 --> 23:38.095
an amateur oenophile, perhaps.

23:38.162 --> 23:43.600
But this Frescobaldi - a
first-rate Tuscan chianti.

23:43.668 --> 23:47.437
<i>Very popular amongst the</i>
<i>Florentine aristocracy.</i>

23:47.505 --> 23:51.274
A talented winemaker indeed.

23:51.342 --> 23:54.678
Shame that he perished
along with his family

23:54.746 --> 23:56.847
when my soldiers torched
his vineyard.

23:56.914 --> 23:58.882
Al.

23:58.950 --> 24:00.450
All that was salvaged
from the estate

24:00.518 --> 24:03.754
are the bottles now
in my possession.

24:03.821 --> 24:07.958
We also thank you for the
new garments, Duke Alfonso.

24:08.025 --> 24:10.727
Formal delegates from Florence
must look the part.

24:12.630 --> 24:15.665
Though I question why Lorenzo
brought along an antique

24:15.733 --> 24:18.835
and not a more
formidable companion.

24:18.903 --> 24:22.906
Piero Da Vinci
is my personal notary.

24:22.974 --> 24:24.608
And one of my most trusted
counselors.

24:24.675 --> 24:29.713
Da Vinci? Kin to Leonardo?

24:29.781 --> 24:31.181
Indeed.

24:31.249 --> 24:32.315
He is the um...

24:32.383 --> 24:35.886
proud father of
the celebrated artist.

24:35.953 --> 24:38.688
And sodomite.
Never convicted.

24:40.792 --> 24:44.861
I've met the man.
I read a different verdict.

24:44.929 --> 24:47.264
Leonardo works for Florence
from afar.

24:47.331 --> 24:49.299
Demean him at your peril.

24:49.367 --> 24:51.201
Will the King be joining us?

24:51.269 --> 24:55.238
I feel a monarch of his years
will bring invaluable wisdom to this table.

24:57.341 --> 24:59.776
Yes, indeed.

24:59.844 --> 25:02.579
I will do whatever it takes
to resolve our conflict.

25:02.647 --> 25:05.916
Father will be pleased
to hear that.

25:05.983 --> 25:09.619
He so enjoys it when his
captives are willing to play along.

25:10.077 --> 25:11.324
Oh!

25:15.560 --> 25:17.227
What have you done?

25:17.295 --> 25:19.896
Precisely what you asked.

25:19.964 --> 25:22.866
The King is looking
forward to seeing you.

25:31.409 --> 25:34.277
Damn them!

25:34.345 --> 25:37.514
Or rather, damn myself, as I
stand the dupe in all this.

25:37.582 --> 25:39.049
Signora...

25:39.116 --> 25:41.017
this knowledge provides
an opportunity

25:41.085 --> 25:42.686
to counter
their schemes.

25:42.753 --> 25:44.554
I only wish it did.

25:44.622 --> 25:47.724
Carlo's confirmation to the
board is but a formality.

25:47.792 --> 25:49.025
If I raise an
objection now,

25:49.093 --> 25:50.660
it'll further
weaken my position,

25:50.728 --> 25:53.663
given that I nominated
Carlo myself.

25:55.600 --> 25:59.269
I cannot believe I was
so easily fooled by him.

25:59.337 --> 26:01.371
Perhaps you were not.

26:01.439 --> 26:03.340
Well, you heard
the whispers.

26:03.407 --> 26:07.744
Sassetti only spoke of using
Carlo's name in their scheme.

26:07.812 --> 26:10.714
There's a chance Carlo himself
is unaware.

26:10.781 --> 26:12.716
Unlikely.

26:12.783 --> 26:16.920
The Pazzis proved
the seduction of power is intoxicating.

26:16.988 --> 26:20.490
He doesn't care about power.
He's here because of his father.

26:20.524 --> 26:22.492
How do you know this?

26:22.560 --> 26:24.694
She asked me to present
all this to you.

26:24.762 --> 26:26.563
She was afraid...

26:26.631 --> 26:29.532
Why, what have you heard?
The servants trust Carlo.

26:29.600 --> 26:31.201
They say he was always
a Medici,

26:31.269 --> 26:34.170
despite being wronged
by those who scorned his lineage.

26:34.238 --> 26:35.672
He was his
father's favorite.

26:35.740 --> 26:38.675
Some believe, if there's anyone
Cosimo shared his secrets with,

26:38.743 --> 26:40.210
it was Carlo.

27:06.804 --> 27:09.940
The sickness will pass once we
get used to the altitude.

27:13.377 --> 27:16.146
Or we can just launch ourselves
over the edge here.

27:16.213 --> 27:18.114
Don't try it
while you're bound to me!

27:21.352 --> 27:24.854
So are we gonna let
these savages kill us?

27:24.922 --> 27:27.958
The alternatives are rather
limited just now.

27:39.737 --> 27:41.972
They're distracted by news
from that messenger.

27:45.643 --> 27:47.577
I could be free from the pole
with a couple of tugs.

27:47.645 --> 27:50.213
Then what? We try and run still
bound to these poles?

27:50.281 --> 27:51.815
Have you anything better?
We have to go out fighting.

27:51.882 --> 27:53.350
Now is not the time!

27:53.417 --> 27:56.853
And later, when we're brought
before some crag-faced cannibal?

27:56.921 --> 27:59.255
Look at where listening
to you has brought us.

28:00.458 --> 28:01.758
Aaargh!

28:33.524 --> 28:35.492
Tell her I'll be happy
to service her

28:35.559 --> 28:37.727
in any number of ways
to save the rest of you.

28:39.397 --> 28:41.931
I'm willing to make
that sacrifice.

28:51.609 --> 28:53.576
Our destination.

28:53.644 --> 28:55.578
The town made of stone.

28:55.646 --> 28:57.480
Just as the Abyssinian said.

29:35.219 --> 29:37.487
I take back
what I said about savages.

30:27.137 --> 30:28.971
It is unanimous.

30:29.039 --> 30:30.333
Carlo de Medici,

30:30.358 --> 30:33.329
welcome to the governing board
of the Medici Bank.

30:34.177 --> 30:38.080
I shall strive to satisfy
your faith in me.

30:38.148 --> 30:39.315
Signors...

30:39.383 --> 30:41.350
have we any other business?

30:41.418 --> 30:44.520
<i>Unfortunately, there is an issue</i>
<i>of grave importance.</i>

30:45.989 --> 30:48.591
I have recently had rd
from King Ferdinand

30:48.659 --> 30:52.328
of his intention to default
payment on all loans

30:52.396 --> 30:57.099
unless we remove Clarice Orsini
as head of this institution

30:57.167 --> 31:00.670
for her sins against
the Holy Church.

31:04.207 --> 31:07.743
Clearly, I will not capitulate
to the blackmail of a creditor.

31:07.811 --> 31:10.579
A true leader would take
whatever steps necessary

31:10.647 --> 31:14.150
to ensure our business
sees another day, month...

31:14.217 --> 31:18.888
If this is your attempt
at requesting my resignation, rethink.

31:18.955 --> 31:21.290
Without a vote of this board,
it will not happen.

31:21.358 --> 31:24.927
Then you leave us no choice.

31:24.995 --> 31:29.231
Signors, let us answer the call
for new leadership.

31:29.299 --> 31:32.334
A majority of seven
is required.

31:38.075 --> 31:41.210
Carlo, how will you vote?

31:47.317 --> 31:49.552
As a man of faith,

31:49.619 --> 31:53.089
I respect a commitment
to the Holy Church.

31:53.156 --> 31:58.294
And supporting him is wise
if that's what forces Ferdinand's decision.

31:59.896 --> 32:01.664
But it is not.

32:04.901 --> 32:07.303
I vote with Clarice Orsini.

32:09.873 --> 32:12.108
This letter details
the back-room deal

32:12.175 --> 32:14.810
between King Ferdinand
and Signor Portinari,

32:14.878 --> 32:17.913
in which favorable interest
rates were offered

32:17.981 --> 32:23.085
in direct exchange for the
King's threat of default.

32:28.759 --> 32:31.927
I charge this letter
not only as malfeasance

32:31.995 --> 32:34.630
but also treason.

32:34.698 --> 32:38.200
Guards, remove this well-fed
Judas to the Bargello.

32:38.268 --> 32:41.937
This is outrageous!
This melanzana deceived us!

32:42.005 --> 32:45.674
I'll...get...you...back...
for this!

32:45.742 --> 32:49.645
Signors, today each of you have
made your loyalties clear.

32:49.713 --> 32:51.080
Now I must consider
what to do

32:51.148 --> 32:55.651
with those no longer
supporting my leadership.

32:55.719 --> 33:00.890
Signor de Medici, I wonder, do
you have any suggestions?

33:00.957 --> 33:02.958
Perhaps this board
has grown too large.

33:03.026 --> 33:06.562
We can do more with less.

33:06.630 --> 33:09.231
Unless some members would be
willing to relinquish

33:09.299 --> 33:13.536
a portion of their sizeable salaries
for the good of Florence?

33:13.603 --> 33:17.640
Excellent.

33:17.707 --> 33:21.410
I trust the details
are secure in your hands.

33:33.790 --> 33:35.758
The sickness to your
stomach will pass.

33:37.194 --> 33:40.930
My alchemists continually tinker
with their recipe

33:40.997 --> 33:43.299
for oil of vitriol.

33:45.101 --> 33:49.605
They never get it right.

33:49.673 --> 33:50.639
When I was a young man,

33:50.707 --> 33:52.675
a Chinese delegation
came to Italy,

33:52.742 --> 33:54.710
bearing many treasures.

33:54.778 --> 33:56.545
But their most precious gift

33:56.613 --> 34:02.084
was teaching their art of
preserving human bodies.

34:02.152 --> 34:05.688
The use of antimony salts
in embalming fluid.

34:05.755 --> 34:07.122
Inspired!

34:07.190 --> 34:08.724
Where is Piero?

34:08.792 --> 34:10.259
Intact...

34:10.327 --> 34:12.428
for the time being.

34:14.364 --> 34:17.733
The human body always reminds me
of our Italian peninsula.

34:17.801 --> 34:21.270
Such a complex assembly
of delicate parts,

34:21.338 --> 34:23.304
each one with a purpose.

34:23.373 --> 34:25.074
Yet every now and then...

34:25.141 --> 34:28.244
one brings down the others.

34:28.311 --> 34:31.947
For the rest of
the organism to thrive,

34:32.014 --> 34:36.217
a steady and unwavering hand is
called upon to remove...

34:36.286 --> 34:38.587
..the infected piece.

34:45.929 --> 34:48.530
King Ferrante...

34:48.598 --> 34:53.534
you may see Florence
as a disease.

34:53.603 --> 34:55.704
But if you'll allow me
to speak on her behalf...

34:55.772 --> 34:57.072
What's more to say?

34:57.139 --> 35:00.175
The Holy Father himself
decreed your city...

35:00.243 --> 35:02.278
unbecoming in
the eyes of the Lord.

35:02.345 --> 35:06.649
Pope Sixtus has overreached, as
he has in the past.

35:06.716 --> 35:09.051
The Duke of Milan was murdered
at his behest.

35:09.119 --> 35:11.053
Even my own brother, Giuliano,

35:11.121 --> 35:14.023
slaughtered in a house
of worship on holy Easter Sunday.

35:14.090 --> 35:15.624
Popes come and go.

35:15.692 --> 35:20.195
I choose my alliances for the safety
and glory of my own kingdom.

35:20.263 --> 35:23.732
Then side with Florence!

35:23.800 --> 35:26.869
You seek to curb
Ottoman incursions.

35:26.937 --> 35:29.238
You fear the French will renew
their claims to Naples.

35:29.306 --> 35:31.273
I fear no one.

35:31.341 --> 35:34.043
Not that dandy French king.

35:34.110 --> 35:39.181
Or an Ottoman infidel
eyeing our shores.

35:39.249 --> 35:42.217
You speak of fear?

35:42.285 --> 35:45.521
I will show you fear.

36:25.261 --> 36:26.495
He looks fancy.

37:49.345 --> 37:50.879
Whatever's about
to happen...

37:54.584 --> 37:56.051
..she's not happy
about it.

37:56.119 --> 37:58.921
Yeah. That makes two of us.

38:23.847 --> 38:26.982
Kaliari!

38:41.898 --> 38:44.800
Kaliari.

38:48.905 --> 38:50.739
What am I supposed to do?

38:50.807 --> 38:52.975
"Kaliari".

38:53.042 --> 38:55.010
I think they want us
to choose.

38:55.078 --> 38:56.778
I saw this in Mali.

38:56.846 --> 38:59.648
It's a ritual to determine
your value to the tribe.

38:59.716 --> 39:01.116
You must choose an item

39:01.184 --> 39:04.086
to identify your place
among them.

39:09.025 --> 39:11.126
Kaliari!

39:11.194 --> 39:14.930
Then I choose to be
a warrior!

39:15.632 --> 39:17.966
Amongst warriors!

40:14.857 --> 40:18.227
I am pleased you honored
our accord.

40:18.294 --> 40:20.195
Why would I do otherwise?

40:20.263 --> 40:21.897
Because you broke
the deal

40:21.965 --> 40:24.499
you made with Portinari
and Sassetti.

40:24.567 --> 40:29.605
So I cannot help wonder when
your word means something.

40:29.672 --> 40:33.875
I tested them
to lure them out.

40:33.943 --> 40:35.689
But I could not be bound

40:35.714 --> 40:38.236
to any vow that might harm
your interests.

40:39.015 --> 40:40.782
Well, I...

40:40.850 --> 40:42.684
I'm impressed.

40:42.752 --> 40:45.587
Thank you.

40:52.762 --> 40:53.883
<i>You take vows</i>
<i>very seriously.</i>

40:53.930 --> 40:57.666
<i>As do I.</i>

40:57.734 --> 41:01.637
But when others do not
honor their promises,

41:01.704 --> 41:06.341
neither should you feel bound to
anything but your own interests.

41:06.409 --> 41:08.477
Duly noted.

41:08.544 --> 41:12.648
I will not discuss the matter
unless you bring it up.

41:13.583 --> 41:16.618
I await your pleasure.

41:38.074 --> 41:41.610
Welcome to my black museum.

41:41.678 --> 41:46.481
Every piece here was prepared
and arranged by my own hands.

41:46.549 --> 41:52.020
Their faces bear the mark
of their final moment on our earth.

41:53.222 --> 41:54.990
Here it is on display.

41:55.058 --> 41:57.492
Fear - for my amusement.

41:57.560 --> 41:59.094
Why would you do
such a thing?

41:59.162 --> 42:02.497
Every piece here became
part of my collection by their own hand.

42:02.565 --> 42:06.435
Each of them was in the position
you are now in,

42:06.502 --> 42:07.969
Lorenzo.

42:08.037 --> 42:11.473
Held against his will
by a mad king?

42:11.541 --> 42:14.576
I am a king, yes.

42:14.644 --> 42:17.679
All the same,
I rule by divine right.

42:17.747 --> 42:21.717
So all must earn a seat
at my table.

42:21.784 --> 42:23.085
How?

42:23.152 --> 42:25.153
Call it a game.

42:25.221 --> 42:28.790
You are a hunter,
are you not?

42:28.858 --> 42:31.393
My brother more than me.

42:31.461 --> 42:34.629
My game requires
exceptional skill.

42:35.255 --> 42:36.778
What do you say?

42:36.803 --> 42:39.067
Does Florence have
a champion in you?

42:39.068 --> 42:40.869
Or are you just
another pretender?

42:40.937 --> 42:45.140
I will accept any sick measure
you cast my way.

42:45.208 --> 42:47.743
Wonderful.

42:47.810 --> 42:52.948
I await your attempt
to demonstrate true merit.

42:53.015 --> 42:56.351
Or die like the rest.

43:01.124 --> 43:02.591
What choice?

43:02.658 --> 43:04.459
Da Vinci?

43:04.527 --> 43:07.629
You're cleverer than I am.

43:07.697 --> 43:10.265
I don't know.
What?

43:10.333 --> 43:13.001
I don't know, I don't know.
Perhaps if I had more time.

43:22.578 --> 43:26.114
Then like our Lord...
Come on!

43:26.182 --> 43:29.084
..I drink from his chalice.

44:28.511 --> 44:30.312
At least there's only one choice left.
We may get out alive.

44:30.379 --> 44:31.913
No, that can't be
all there is.

44:31.981 --> 44:33.748
They're too advanced
for that.

44:33.816 --> 44:35.617
The thin air's gotten to you.
We're gonna be alright.

44:35.685 --> 44:39.654
There's got to be more to it
than a process of elimination, Zo.

44:39.722 --> 44:43.358
Fuck, I'm missing something!
Then fucking figure it out!

44:54.537 --> 44:57.072
He wants us dead.

44:57.139 --> 44:59.407
You need us to succeed.

45:02.712 --> 45:05.213
Of course.

45:05.281 --> 45:08.250
The only time an exotic beauty
chooses me over you,

45:08.317 --> 45:09.684
it's the death-dealing one.

45:09.752 --> 45:11.920
Pai.
Pai, good.

45:16.158 --> 45:17.692
There's nothing advanced
about these monsters.

45:17.760 --> 45:19.661
They're just playing
with their fucking food.

45:44.120 --> 45:46.855
Oh, fuck.

45:46.923 --> 45:48.990
Oh, Jesus. Fuck...

46:37.640 --> 46:39.441
Okay. Fuck.

46:48.618 --> 46:50.986
Are you sure about this?

46:58.861 --> 47:00.161
What the fuck are you doing?

47:09.905 --> 47:12.007
Kalsai.

47:12.074 --> 47:13.675
Kalsai.

47:13.743 --> 47:17.212
Kalsai! Kalsai!

47:30.726 --> 47:32.627
Life.

47:35.965 --> 47:37.732
That's the answer they seek.

47:48.678 --> 47:52.313
Leonardo Da Vinci.

48:03.993 --> 48:05.694
She knows my name.

48:05.761 --> 48:07.195
She knows my name!

48:13.436 --> 48:16.771
<i>Zo?</i>

48:16.839 --> 48:18.273
Nico!

48:18.340 --> 48:20.575
You little pizzle!
Nico!

48:20.643 --> 48:23.578
Oh, it is so good to see you!

48:23.646 --> 48:25.613
That shipwreck, I knew
it'd take more than that to sink him.

48:25.681 --> 48:26.614
How did you survive?

48:26.682 --> 48:29.551
Not everyone abandoned him.

48:29.618 --> 48:31.152
Shitheel.

48:31.220 --> 48:33.621
Let him.

48:42.932 --> 48:44.899
Get up. Get up!

48:44.967 --> 48:48.970
I tried to take
your life, so...

48:49.038 --> 48:53.241
..I understand your desire
to do the same.

48:53.309 --> 48:57.114
But today, we are united
by the hand of the divine.

48:57.115 --> 48:58.022
No, Don't!

48:58.047 --> 48:59.681
Out of my way, Nico, he
deserves every bit of this!

48:59.682 --> 49:01.683
I can't let you.
After what he did?

49:01.751 --> 49:02.717
Left me to drown,
tortured you.

49:02.785 --> 49:04.385
Why does this prick
deserve mercy?

49:04.453 --> 49:08.356
If the Lord wanted him dead, he
would've taken him at sea.

49:08.424 --> 49:10.024
What?

49:10.092 --> 49:13.194
God spared us all.

49:13.262 --> 49:17.532
That is a sign that we must
join together to achieve our goal.

49:17.600 --> 49:20.468
Who the fuck is we?
He's right.

49:20.536 --> 49:24.005
It's us against them.
No, no.

49:34.116 --> 49:35.316
Count.

49:35.384 --> 49:37.018
Artista.

49:38.987 --> 49:41.823
Our prayers for deliverance
have been answered.

49:41.890 --> 49:45.393
Today, we are blessed.

49:45.461 --> 49:47.061
This is blessed?
Yes.

49:47.129 --> 49:49.697
Yes, it is. I live by faith.

49:49.765 --> 49:53.201
For weeks, we have been held
captive thousands of miles

49:53.268 --> 49:57.438
from home atop this mountain
with no hope of escape, then...

49:57.506 --> 50:00.208
..he sends you.

50:00.275 --> 50:02.677
But...

50:02.744 --> 50:06.314
if we put our minds
to freedom, Da Vinci,

50:06.381 --> 50:09.784
the wisdom of the
Book of Leaves will be ours.

50:09.852 --> 50:12.153
The Book of Leaves...

50:12.221 --> 50:17.625
..is not meant
for just you and I.

50:20.129 --> 50:23.164
The Book of Leaves
will save us all.

50:24.867 --> 50:27.201
You understand us.

50:27.269 --> 50:29.537
He learns our tongue.

50:29.605 --> 50:32.707
Is it so impossible
that I could speak yours?

50:32.774 --> 50:34.609
It creates
many questions.

50:36.278 --> 50:37.712
I am Ima Kama,

50:37.779 --> 50:40.748
High Priestess of
the Children of the Sun.

50:40.816 --> 50:43.117
And I shall answer
all questions.

50:43.185 --> 50:46.087
But only to you.

50:46.155 --> 50:47.755
Why me?

50:47.823 --> 50:52.093
Your face is one
I've seen before.

51:59.394 --> 52:01.395
Christ, I needed that!

52:32.561 --> 52:34.795
These markings tell
the story of my people.

52:34.863 --> 52:38.566
We have no need to travel
the seas as you do.

52:38.634 --> 52:41.602
And yet, somehow, you learned to
speak our language.

52:45.140 --> 52:47.908
You are not the first
of your kind to arrive.

52:51.013 --> 52:53.180
They came here when
I was just a little girl.

52:55.284 --> 52:57.451
We called them the Sun
and the Moon.

52:57.519 --> 52:58.953
<i>Who are they?</i>

52:59.021 --> 53:01.055
The man was dark as night,

53:01.123 --> 53:05.593
with images etched
into his skin.

53:05.661 --> 53:07.762
The Abyssinian.

53:09.798 --> 53:13.200
He aided me on my journey
to this place.

53:18.740 --> 53:21.575
And the woman?

53:24.946 --> 53:27.982
Bright and warm
as the sun.

53:28.050 --> 53:31.652
She saved me from
being sacrificed.

53:31.720 --> 53:37.058
She used her knowledge
to heal my wounds.

53:37.125 --> 53:39.860
And set me on the path
to High Priestess.

53:42.764 --> 53:44.832
The day she left here,

53:44.900 --> 53:47.501
she told me you would
follow in her path.

53:52.240 --> 53:56.110
It is her face I see
in yours, Leonardo.

53:58.246 --> 53:59.680
My mother.

53:59.748 --> 54:02.750
She was here.

54:02.818 --> 54:08.022
Caterina lived among us
for many days and nights.

54:08.090 --> 54:09.857
And she taught me
your tongue.

54:09.925 --> 54:13.828
She spoke of her vow
to see you again

54:13.895 --> 54:15.796
once her task was done.

54:15.864 --> 54:18.966
She came for
the Book of Leaves.

54:21.236 --> 54:26.173
Your mother and the Book
of Leaves saved my life.

54:31.813 --> 54:35.449
It's real.

54:35.517 --> 54:38.052
It's real! It's real!
