02:11.569 --> 02:14.024
Mom, what are you doing?

02:14.363 --> 02:16.236
Oh, l was just remembering
how sweet it was

02:16.406 --> 02:19.359
to hold a baby in my arms, that's all.

02:19.534 --> 02:22.534
Yeah, l was kind of cute, wasn't l?

02:23.621 --> 02:25.364
But that was a long time ago.

02:25.540 --> 02:30.082
l know, don't remind me.
l'm too old for this.

02:33.755 --> 02:35.581
You're going to the doctor today,
aren't you?

02:35.799 --> 02:36.961
Yes.

02:37.134 --> 02:38.378
As if l need him to confirm

02:38.552 --> 02:41.588
what every home-pregnancy test
on the market has already told me.

02:41.763 --> 02:43.802
What does Mel have to say
about all of this?

02:44.390 --> 02:47.011
You want your eggs
scrambled or fried?

02:47.184 --> 02:49.591
ls there a reason
why you're not answering me?

02:49.770 --> 02:53.221
- What?
- Mel. How is he taking all of this?

02:53.398 --> 02:55.390
- He doesn't know.
- What?

02:55.567 --> 02:58.057
Kelly, he doesn't want
any more children.

02:58.236 --> 03:00.987
All he can talk about is how happy
he is you and David are grown

03:01.156 --> 03:02.531
so that we can enjoy ourselves.

03:02.699 --> 03:04.193
Yeah, but you still have to tell him.

03:05.451 --> 03:06.695
Kelly, it's not that easy.

03:07.244 --> 03:10.659
Why not? l mean, he doesn't
want a baby, you don't want a baby.

03:10.831 --> 03:12.740
Why don't you tell him
you're taking care of it?

03:19.464 --> 03:21.586
Valentine's Day
is my absolute favourite holiday.

03:21.758 --> 03:23.501
lt is?
That's not what you said last year.

03:23.676 --> 03:25.668
Well, it is now.

03:25.845 --> 03:27.754
So, what are you and David doing?
Any big plans?

03:27.930 --> 03:30.420
l don't know. David said something
about dinner with his dad.

03:30.599 --> 03:32.721
- Well, that sounds romantic.
- Yeah, not.

03:32.893 --> 03:34.268
So, what about you guys?

03:34.436 --> 03:36.179
- He won't tell me.
- lt's a surprise.

03:36.354 --> 03:38.097
- Oh, Dylan, come on.
- Nope.

03:38.273 --> 03:39.470
Okay, let me guess.

03:39.649 --> 03:40.728
- Dinner.
- No.

03:40.900 --> 03:42.358
- Dancing.
- Stop guessing.

03:42.527 --> 03:46.939
- l'm not telling you until Valentine's--
- Come on. Just one clue. Please?

03:47.114 --> 03:48.773
Okay.

03:49.658 --> 03:50.820
We'll be lying down.

03:51.785 --> 03:55.034
- Lying down, like in a bed?
- Maybe.

03:55.247 --> 03:56.409
Sounds sewy.

03:56.581 --> 03:59.415
- Come on, that's not enough of a clue.
- Yes, it is.

04:00.335 --> 04:02.374
See you.

04:02.628 --> 04:04.953
So, Kelly, what do you think?

04:05.131 --> 04:07.586
- About what?
- About me and Dylan.

04:07.758 --> 04:09.667
What do you think he has planned?

04:11.095 --> 04:12.292
l don't know, Bren.

04:12.471 --> 04:14.842
And l hate to break it to you,
but l really don't care.

04:16.808 --> 04:18.882
Well, excuse me.

04:22.313 --> 04:25.728
Kelly, hi. l wanted to talk to you
about Valentine's Day.

04:25.900 --> 04:27.975
Since my dad and l
are coming over for dinner,

04:28.152 --> 04:33.525
and it is Valentine's Day and all, would
you mind if l brought Donna over?

04:33.740 --> 04:37.155
- Oh, David, that's so sweet.
- No, it's not all right.

04:39.287 --> 04:40.745
Sorry.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.111
Kelly, lighten up.

04:42.290 --> 04:44.780
Look, l don't even know
if there's gonna be a dinner, okay?

04:45.960 --> 04:49.957
Look, l gotta go start my show.
l'll see you guys later.

04:50.130 --> 04:52.122
Bye.

04:52.883 --> 04:55.041
You know, l'm really tired of you
being mean to David

04:55.218 --> 04:56.498
all the time for no reason.

04:57.137 --> 04:59.176
Donna, l have my reasons.
Believe me.

04:59.389 --> 05:00.420
What, then? What is it?

05:00.598 --> 05:02.637
lf you don't have a reason,
just get off his back.

05:02.809 --> 05:05.762
- Look, l don't wanna talk about it.
- Not even to us?

05:06.687 --> 05:07.718
Not to anyone.

05:07.938 --> 05:11.769
Kelly, come on, you can talk to us.
We're your best friends, remember?

05:11.942 --> 05:14.432
Right. lf you can't trust us,
who can you trust?

05:16.071 --> 05:19.273
Okay, but you guys have to promise
not to tell anyone, and l mean it.

05:19.491 --> 05:21.649
- Cross my heart.
- Me too, it's crossed.

05:23.411 --> 05:26.115
David's father and my mother...

05:26.288 --> 05:28.992
- God, l can't believe this is happening.
- What?

05:29.708 --> 05:33.290
They're always harping on us
to be so careful.

05:33.712 --> 05:34.743
No.

05:36.047 --> 05:37.838
- Yeah.
- What?

05:38.842 --> 05:40.336
Donna, my mom's pregnant.

05:42.220 --> 05:43.678
Oh, my God.

05:49.476 --> 05:52.227
Don't forget, West Beverly faces off
against Beverly tonight.

05:52.396 --> 05:54.602
The game starts at 8:00,

05:54.773 --> 05:57.607
and we're hoping
it's a St. Valentine's Day massacre.

05:57.776 --> 05:59.435
So be there.

05:59.944 --> 06:04.071
- Hi, l have to talk to you.
- Oh, yeah, me too.

06:05.074 --> 06:08.857
Listen, about Valentine's Day.
l'm sorry Kelly was so weird.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.573
lt's all right.
She probably sensed something's up.

06:11.747 --> 06:13.205
Yeah.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.154
What do you mean?

06:16.293 --> 06:18.997
- Can you keep a secret?
- Of course.

06:20.588 --> 06:23.588
My dad told me he's planning on
asking Kelly's mom to marry him

06:23.758 --> 06:25.584
on Valentine's Day.

06:25.760 --> 06:29.045
Wow, that is so romantic.
Especially under the circumstances.

06:30.055 --> 06:31.169
What circumstances?

06:32.140 --> 06:33.799
Come on, David. Don't play dumb.

06:33.975 --> 06:35.634
Kelly already told me about the baby.

06:37.854 --> 06:38.885
The baby?

06:41.566 --> 06:44.566
Wait a second. You don't know?

06:45.319 --> 06:46.350
Know what?

06:47.321 --> 06:49.894
Oh, God, forget it, David.
Forget l said a word.

06:50.073 --> 06:52.694
No, no, Donna, tell me.
What's going on?

06:52.868 --> 06:55.405
l can't tell you, l promised.
Kelly will kill me.

06:55.870 --> 06:57.577
Come on, Donna. l'm your boyfriend.

06:58.414 --> 07:01.663
Okay, but you have to swear.
This didn't come from me.

07:02.543 --> 07:03.657
You can trust me.

07:06.547 --> 07:08.124
Kelly's mom is pregnant.

07:10.300 --> 07:11.710
What?

07:11.968 --> 07:14.541
Well, that's probably why
your dad is asking her to marry him.

07:15.930 --> 07:18.800
No, no way. There must be
some sort of misunderstanding.

07:18.975 --> 07:21.050
Oh, God.
l knew l shouldn't have said anything.

07:21.227 --> 07:24.227
Donna, that can't be true.
My dad would've told me about this.

07:25.314 --> 07:29.940
- Maybe, except for one thing.
- What's that?

07:32.279 --> 07:34.650
Maybe your dad doesn't know.

07:41.162 --> 07:44.495
So, what do you think, spatula man?
ls it proper to give a friend a Valentine?

07:44.665 --> 07:46.990
lf l give Kelly a card,
she's gonna think l'm interested.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.123
You are interested.

07:49.294 --> 07:51.701
Yeah, l'm interested,
but only if she's interested first.

07:51.880 --> 07:54.833
- l don't want her thinking l'm pining.
- Then don't send her one.

07:55.008 --> 07:57.130
Then she'll think l don't care.

07:57.302 --> 07:58.712
You know.

07:58.886 --> 08:02.301
You know you know.

08:03.641 --> 08:05.929
That's the racing form, isn't it?

08:07.061 --> 08:11.058
The only paper that gives true meaning
to the words ''news that you can use.''

08:11.273 --> 08:14.439
- Can l look at it?
- Sure.

08:15.318 --> 08:17.725
l've never looked
at one of these before.

08:20.490 --> 08:24.487
Someone hit the Pick Six
and won $320,000?

08:24.702 --> 08:25.816
What's a Pick Six?

08:25.995 --> 08:28.320
That's when you pick six winners
on the same day.

08:28.539 --> 08:33.414
- Have you ever done that before?
- Only in my dreams.

08:34.461 --> 08:37.496
- Wow, you can actually read this?
- Sure.

08:37.672 --> 08:38.869
See, over here,

08:39.048 --> 08:41.881
this tells you all the horses
in today's card at the track.

08:42.051 --> 08:45.964
lt tells you the horse,
the owner, the trainer, the jockey.

08:46.138 --> 08:48.545
How well they did
in their last few races.

08:48.724 --> 08:51.012
Everything you need to know
to make your pick.

08:51.643 --> 08:55.094
Or you can forget about all this
and pick one out of the air.

08:55.271 --> 08:57.310
Let's see...

08:57.482 --> 08:59.474
Since l can't make
heads or tails of this,

08:59.650 --> 09:01.808
l think l will take
the thin-air approach.

09:01.986 --> 09:07.027
And l like this one.
The number three in the eighth race.

09:09.201 --> 09:11.738
Oh, that doesn't look too good.
lt's kind of a long shot.

09:11.912 --> 09:13.536
But that means
you can win big, right?

09:13.705 --> 09:15.697
Maybe.
You see, because these horses--

09:15.874 --> 09:19.076
- What's going on, guys?
- Oh, l'm just helping Nat pick a horse.

09:19.252 --> 09:20.959
What do you know
about horseracing, Andrea?

09:21.128 --> 09:23.832
Nothing.
l just like the name of the horse.

09:24.006 --> 09:26.164
Andrea, you can't pick a horse
by the name.

09:26.341 --> 09:28.416
lt's just a feeling, all right?

09:28.594 --> 09:32.425
Nat, would you please explain that
picking a horse is a statistical science?

09:32.597 --> 09:33.877
Sometimes.

09:34.057 --> 09:36.891
l had a girlfriend once,
used to do the same thing.

09:37.268 --> 09:42.344
She would pick a winner every time.
Of course, l never listened to her.

09:43.232 --> 09:48.901
Take the three on the eighth race, Nat.
lt's coming in loud and clear.

09:49.071 --> 09:53.282
Well, l learned my lesson never
to argue with a woman's intuition.

09:53.450 --> 09:55.193
What's the name
of this horse, anyway?

09:56.911 --> 09:58.570
Lovesick.

10:09.339 --> 10:11.212
- Hi, Arlene.
- David.

10:11.383 --> 10:14.004
- Hello, how are you?
- Fine.

10:14.177 --> 10:15.339
ls my dad here?

10:15.511 --> 10:18.677
You know, David,
l can't believe how you've grown.

10:18.848 --> 10:21.385
- Arlene, you saw me three weeks ago.
- Really?

10:21.559 --> 10:23.930
Well, you must have shot up
three inches since then.

10:25.270 --> 10:27.345
ls my dad busy?
l really need to talk to him.

10:27.522 --> 10:29.431
He always has time to see you.

10:29.608 --> 10:32.229
- Go on in.
- Thanks.

10:32.861 --> 10:35.019
- Hi, Dad.
- David.

10:35.196 --> 10:36.820
What a great surprise. Come on in.

10:36.989 --> 10:40.737
l didn't expect to see you
till Valentine's Day dinner at Jackie's.

10:40.910 --> 10:43.994
Yeah, well, that's what l wanted
to talk to you about.

10:44.580 --> 10:47.580
- ls everything okay?
- Yeah, it couldn't be better.

10:47.749 --> 10:49.824
Here, look at this.

10:51.795 --> 10:55.210
l picked it up this morning.
What do you think?

10:55.673 --> 10:57.131
l know it's kind of extravagant,

10:57.300 --> 10:59.458
but if anybody's worth it,
Jackie is, right?

10:59.635 --> 11:02.884
Yeah. Yeah, l guess so.

11:07.142 --> 11:09.763
David, l know this is
all kind of sudden,

11:09.936 --> 11:12.687
but you'll see, before you know it,
we'll be one big, happy family.

11:12.856 --> 11:16.189
Yeah. One big, happy, big family.

11:17.151 --> 11:18.728
David, is something bothering you?

11:18.903 --> 11:20.147
l don't know. Should there be?

11:22.990 --> 11:25.694
Well, l know this
can't be easy for you.

11:26.994 --> 11:28.950
Here l am going on about rings,

11:29.121 --> 11:31.160
and you're facing
a whole new change.

11:31.331 --> 11:33.868
Just remember one thing:

11:34.334 --> 11:38.662
l'm here for you first and foremost.
You can always come to me.

11:40.297 --> 11:42.253
l just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

11:42.424 --> 11:46.587
This is what l want, David.
lt's making me very happy.

11:47.763 --> 11:50.597
- l guess l'm happy too.
- Good.

11:54.060 --> 11:55.304
Donna, how could you?

11:55.978 --> 11:59.062
Well, see, l thought David knew,
and l guess l let it slip.

11:59.231 --> 12:02.350
- But l told you it was a secret.
- l know, but...

12:02.860 --> 12:05.185
l thought l could trust you.
How could you do this to me?

12:05.362 --> 12:07.188
l didn't mean to, it just came out.

12:07.364 --> 12:10.815
How could something this important,
this confidential, just come out?

12:10.992 --> 12:13.862
When he said his dad was planning on
asking your mom to marry him,

12:14.037 --> 12:16.195
- l just assumed.
- What?

12:19.625 --> 12:22.376
Well, see, that's why
this dinner's such a big deal.

12:22.544 --> 12:24.869
Mel's planning on proposing
on Valentine's Day.

12:25.839 --> 12:27.381
lsn't that incredibly romantic?

12:27.883 --> 12:28.914
Oh, my God.

12:29.092 --> 12:31.499
This is so much worse
than l ever imagined.

12:33.096 --> 12:35.847
Look, l know
l shouldn't have said anything,

12:36.015 --> 12:37.841
but watch, everything will be fine.

12:38.017 --> 12:40.768
They'll get married,
live happily ever after,

12:40.936 --> 12:43.509
and no one's ever gonna find out
about any of this.

12:43.689 --> 12:45.183
l promise.

12:45.357 --> 12:46.899
So, what would you say if l told you

12:47.067 --> 12:48.976
a certain mother
of a certain friend of ours

12:49.152 --> 12:53.231
who's going out with a certain father
of a certain friend of ours is pregnant?

12:53.406 --> 12:56.276
- Who?
- Take a wild guess.

12:56.450 --> 12:57.908
Jackie and Mel?

12:58.077 --> 13:01.741
- Well, you didn't hear it from me.
- l don't believe it.

13:01.914 --> 13:05.199
l'll say. l mean,
Jackie's pushing 40 at least, right?

13:05.375 --> 13:10.416
Dad, she's been pushing it for a while.
Anyway, Kelly is really freaked out.

13:10.588 --> 13:12.746
l'd be freaked out too
if Mom was pregnant.

13:12.924 --> 13:13.955
l wouldn't. l'd like it.

13:14.133 --> 13:16.291
A baby in the house,
you remember that, Jim?

13:16.469 --> 13:19.006
Bite your tongue. l mean,
dealing with all those dirty diapers

13:19.180 --> 13:20.887
and sleepless nights, at our age?

13:21.056 --> 13:22.763
Well, maybe l should
give Jackie a call.

13:23.725 --> 13:25.135
No, Mom. You can't.

13:26.686 --> 13:27.717
Look, it's a secret.

13:27.896 --> 13:29.722
l promised Kelly
that l wouldn't say anything.

13:30.482 --> 13:32.189
So you came straight home
and told us?

13:32.358 --> 13:35.726
- No, l didn't, Mom guessed.
- Right.

13:35.903 --> 13:39.271
lt's not the kind of secret that can be
kept for long, if you know what l mean.

13:39.448 --> 13:42.117
Well, l just hope it works out.

13:42.618 --> 13:46.864
Brandon, did Dylan say anything about
what we're doing for Valentine's Day?

13:47.539 --> 13:48.570
Maybe.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.956
Well, l think that you should tell me.

13:52.252 --> 13:55.371
l can't, Bren. When my friends
tell me to keep my mouth shut, l do.

13:55.546 --> 13:57.253
- Brandon.
- l can't.

13:57.423 --> 13:58.502
A promise is a promise.

13:58.674 --> 14:01.591
Come on, just tell me one thing.
ls it something really romantic?

14:03.971 --> 14:05.002
Brandon, come on.

14:11.811 --> 14:13.269
How could you have let this happen?

14:13.438 --> 14:16.059
- l told you it was a secret.
- Mom, they're my best friends.

14:16.232 --> 14:17.891
l didn't know Donna
was gonna tell David.

14:18.067 --> 14:21.020
l thought you were mature enough
for me to share things with you.

14:21.195 --> 14:22.357
l guess l was wrong.

14:22.529 --> 14:26.312
Mom, l'm sorry, okay? But you're
gonna have to tell Mel eventually.

14:26.491 --> 14:28.613
Yeah, l was gonna have to tell Mel.

14:28.785 --> 14:31.869
l didn't expect that he would hear it
through the West Beverly grapevine.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.745
Mom, come on.

14:33.915 --> 14:35.112
Donna may have told David,

14:35.291 --> 14:37.532
but that does not necessarily mean
that David told Mel.

14:37.710 --> 14:38.872
l can't stand it.

14:39.044 --> 14:41.830
You mean, you told Donna,
Donna told David and David told Mel?

14:42.005 --> 14:43.167
This is becoming a farce.

14:43.340 --> 14:46.257
- Look, there's more to it, okay?
- Of course there is.

14:48.094 --> 14:51.676
- Mom, Mel wants to marry you.
- What?

14:54.809 --> 14:58.343
David told Donna that he's planning on
asking you tomorrow night.

14:58.521 --> 15:00.180
Kind of like a Valentine's present.

15:00.731 --> 15:02.972
Oh, my God.

15:03.150 --> 15:04.727
This is worse than l thought.

15:04.901 --> 15:06.063
What's the matter?

15:06.236 --> 15:08.857
l thought this would make you happy.
lsn't this what you wanted?

15:09.030 --> 15:10.358
Of course not.

15:10.532 --> 15:12.026
Don't you see, Kelly?

15:12.200 --> 15:14.406
The only reason Mel's asking me
to marry him now

15:14.577 --> 15:16.818
is because he thinks he has to.

15:16.996 --> 15:18.276
Mom, that's ridiculous.

15:18.455 --> 15:20.577
No, it's not. You don't know him.

15:25.378 --> 15:27.453
This is all my fault.

15:28.214 --> 15:30.087
No, it's not.

15:30.383 --> 15:31.758
lt's my fault.

15:31.926 --> 15:36.302
l got myself into this mess,
and l'm gonna get myself out of it.

15:55.364 --> 15:56.988
Hey, Nat.

15:57.158 --> 16:00.194
Hey, l been waiting
for you guys all day.

16:00.369 --> 16:03.453
- Check this out, Lovesick came in.
- What?

16:03.622 --> 16:07.785
- Your girlfriend's horse paid 1 5 to 1 .
- She's not my girlfriend, Nat, okay?

16:07.959 --> 16:09.239
Maybe you should reconsider.

16:10.378 --> 16:11.492
Hi, all.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.580
- Andrea.
- Andrea.

16:13.756 --> 16:16.507
Hey, lady luck, come in.
Soda's on the house.

16:16.675 --> 16:19.426
- What's this?
- Your horse came in.

16:19.595 --> 16:22.264
Lovesick? That's great.
Did you bet on her, Nat?

16:22.431 --> 16:25.467
You bet l bet on her.
And she paid very handsomely.

16:26.017 --> 16:27.890
- Do it again.
- Oh, l can't.

16:28.061 --> 16:29.934
l don't know anything about this.

16:30.104 --> 16:32.938
Just do what you did the first time.
Use your basic instincts.

16:33.107 --> 16:35.811
Nat, she doesn't have any instincts.
This is Andrea Zuckerman.

16:35.985 --> 16:38.392
- lt's just the facts, man.
- No easy money here, pal.

16:38.570 --> 16:41.356
- Wait a minute.
- That's it, baby, come on.

16:42.532 --> 16:45.698
Come on, feel it, baby.

16:46.202 --> 16:48.657
- She's got something.
- Yeah, gas.

16:48.830 --> 16:51.285
Oh, come on, give her a break,
Rome wasn't built in a day.

16:51.457 --> 16:54.623
No. l thought it was something,
but it's nothing.

16:54.794 --> 16:55.956
- Shucks.
- Yeah.

16:56.128 --> 16:58.701
Wait, this is it.

16:58.881 --> 17:00.837
The third race, number five.
Unrequited.

17:01.008 --> 17:03.677
l'm beginning to sense a pattern
starting to form here.

17:03.844 --> 17:08.007
- First Lovesick, now Unrequited?
- lt's a feeling, that's all.

17:08.181 --> 17:11.134
Good girl.
Excuse me, l have a call to make.

17:14.436 --> 17:17.603
l'm sorry, Mrs. Taylor,
but you don't have an appointment.

17:17.772 --> 17:20.607
- This is personal.
- But you still have to wait.

17:20.776 --> 17:23.348
- l don't have time to wait.
- Wait, you can't go in there.

17:23.528 --> 17:25.685
- You can't go in there.
- Hello, Mel.

17:25.864 --> 17:28.568
l'm sorry, Dr. S.,
but l couldn't stop her.

17:28.741 --> 17:31.410
lt's all right, Arlene. This is Jackie.

17:31.828 --> 17:33.619
- The Jackie?
- Yeah.

17:33.788 --> 17:35.198
Oh, my gosh. l'm so embarrassed.

17:35.372 --> 17:37.494
Go right ahead. Don't mind me.

17:38.375 --> 17:42.206
Jackie, this is a surprise.
Are you all right? ls anything wrong?

17:42.379 --> 17:43.754
Mel, l know you know.

17:47.759 --> 17:50.047
- Know what?
- l know what you're doing, Mel.

17:50.219 --> 17:53.504
And l appreciate it, really l do.
But l can't let you go through with it.

17:53.681 --> 17:54.760
What are you talking about?

17:54.932 --> 17:57.220
Valentine's Day dinner, for starters.
lt's off.

17:57.393 --> 17:59.764
You came all the way down here
to cancel a dinner party?

17:59.937 --> 18:02.771
Couldn't you do that on the phone?
l'm in the middle of a root canal.

18:02.939 --> 18:05.975
This won't take long, l'm letting you off.
You should be thanking me.

18:06.151 --> 18:07.977
- What hook?
- lt's all over, Mel.

18:08.152 --> 18:10.477
l won't let you marry me
out of some sense of obligation.

18:10.655 --> 18:13.228
- Jackie, what are you talking about?
- Oh, come on, Mel.

18:13.407 --> 18:16.241
lt's no secret that you don't want
any more children. Admit it.

18:16.410 --> 18:18.153
- Well, l--
- No, l've made up my mind.

18:18.328 --> 18:19.952
l thought about this long and hard.

18:20.122 --> 18:22.577
And l believe in a woman's
right to choose. l really do.

18:22.749 --> 18:25.453
But this is the only choice for me.
l have to keep this baby.

18:27.253 --> 18:28.830
Baby? You're gonna have a baby?

18:29.005 --> 18:31.460
lt's okay. You don't have to pretend.
l know you know.

18:31.632 --> 18:33.624
- That's why l came as soon as l could.
- Jackie--

18:33.801 --> 18:36.172
Please, just let me finish.
This isn't easy for me, either.

18:36.345 --> 18:39.678
But l've made my decision. l don't think
we should see each other anymore.

18:39.848 --> 18:41.887
- What?
- l won't ask you for child support.

18:42.059 --> 18:44.181
l won't make any demands
on your time or chequebook.

18:44.352 --> 18:45.431
l'm gonna do this myself.

18:45.603 --> 18:47.725
Sorry it had to work out this way,
but that's it.

18:47.897 --> 18:50.019
- Jackie--
- No. l've made up my mind.

18:50.191 --> 18:51.471
l love you, Mel.

18:51.651 --> 18:53.976
But l'm sorry. lt's over.

19:02.786 --> 19:05.988
Did you hear that?
l'm gonna have a baby.

19:06.164 --> 19:08.073
Congratulations.

19:17.049 --> 19:18.329
Come on, Dylan.

19:18.509 --> 19:21.260
What are we doing for Valentine's
Day? You're driving me crazy.

19:22.512 --> 19:24.171
That's the general idea.

19:24.347 --> 19:27.881
All Brandon would tell me
is that it's something very romantic.

19:28.059 --> 19:29.553
lt is.

19:29.727 --> 19:33.095
Then give me some details.
Come on. Another hint, something.

19:34.064 --> 19:35.688
Okay.

19:36.650 --> 19:39.769
lt's red and it's warm.

19:39.945 --> 19:41.320
You're giving me a sweater?

19:41.863 --> 19:45.029
No, it's a little more intimate
than that.

19:46.284 --> 19:50.032
- Red flannel lingerie?
- Funny.

19:50.621 --> 19:53.740
No, it's closer to your heart.

19:54.625 --> 19:57.459
Red, warm and close to my heart.
l don't have a clue.

19:58.170 --> 20:00.162
Good.

20:05.844 --> 20:08.797
l don't believe it. She did it again.

20:09.555 --> 20:12.639
- lt's a lucky guess.
- No way.

20:12.808 --> 20:16.425
- This girl's got something very special.
- Maybe she does.

20:16.603 --> 20:19.093
Well, there's only one way
to find out for sure.

20:19.273 --> 20:21.312
- Test it.
- How?

20:22.025 --> 20:24.266
Well, we go to the track,

20:24.444 --> 20:27.693
Andrea picks the horses,
Nat places the bets.

20:27.864 --> 20:30.698
No way, l'm not gonna make bets
for minors. l could get arrested.

20:30.866 --> 20:32.941
Come on, this is fun.

20:33.119 --> 20:35.075
l've never been to the track before.

20:35.704 --> 20:38.277
- Me either.
- Well, that settles it.

20:38.457 --> 20:40.532
What do you say
we each throw in a hundred bucks?

20:40.709 --> 20:43.246
- l don't have that kind of money.
- Okay, 50.

20:43.753 --> 20:45.377
No, l'm not gonna take your money.

20:45.547 --> 20:46.922
Come on, Nat.

20:47.090 --> 20:49.663
Twenty-five bucks.
What's the big deal?

20:54.555 --> 20:57.306
All right, you're on.
We'll go tomorrow.

20:57.849 --> 21:00.386
ln fact, it's hat day.
But don't tell anybody.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.386
Outstanding.

21:04.606 --> 21:08.437
l told him and he just stood there.

21:11.904 --> 21:14.229
Well, what did you expect him to do?

21:17.910 --> 21:21.076
He didn't even try and stop me.

21:22.580 --> 21:24.157
Well,

21:24.958 --> 21:27.709
maybe it is better off this way.

21:29.170 --> 21:31.328
How could l have let this happen?

21:33.674 --> 21:35.999
l've been wondering
the same thing myself.

21:36.885 --> 21:41.131
Yeah, well, it happened.

21:42.724 --> 21:44.633
Time to move on.

21:46.352 --> 21:47.894
Mom.

21:48.312 --> 21:50.885
Why are you going through with this
when you don't have to?

21:51.816 --> 21:54.982
l told you already. lt's not that easy.

21:55.486 --> 21:58.735
What? You're just gonna lose Mel.

22:00.532 --> 22:02.358
He's the first guy you've met in years

22:02.534 --> 22:07.160
who actually cares about you,
and who you might even love.

22:07.330 --> 22:10.579
All that just so you can have a baby
you don't even want?

22:14.086 --> 22:17.086
Kelly, it's my baby.

22:19.216 --> 22:21.457
lt's a part of me.

22:22.052 --> 22:26.760
- l just can't-- l can't just get rid of it.
- Why not?

22:28.182 --> 22:30.388
You've never had an abortion.

22:32.937 --> 22:36.519
- Have you?
- Yeah.

22:40.235 --> 22:41.266
When?

22:41.945 --> 22:45.064
When you were about 1 0 years old.

22:46.824 --> 22:50.239
l was partying all the time

22:51.036 --> 22:56.160
and l'm embarrassed to admit,
l barely even knew the father.

22:57.793 --> 23:00.118
For me, it was the right thing to do.

23:04.132 --> 23:09.291
When l was little l always used to want
a little brother or a little sister.

23:10.012 --> 23:12.763
l wished for it all the time.

23:13.724 --> 23:19.761
Whenever l threw a penny
into a fountain or blew out a candle.

23:21.439 --> 23:24.225
Well, sweetie,
it looks like you got your wish.

23:33.283 --> 23:34.777
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen,

23:34.952 --> 23:37.407
and welcome to Santa Anita Park.

23:37.579 --> 23:42.323
This afternoon's main track is listed
as fast and the turf course is firm.

23:42.500 --> 23:44.492
- We now have some changes in--
- Thank you.

23:44.669 --> 23:45.831
- You have a great day.
- Bye.

23:46.003 --> 23:49.454
The first race, number seven,
will now be ridden by Corey Nakatani.

23:49.632 --> 23:51.671
Come on, this money
is burning a hole in my pocket.

23:52.843 --> 23:54.420
This is so majestic.

23:54.595 --> 23:56.302
That's why they call it
the sport of kings.

23:56.471 --> 23:59.970
So, Andrea, what do you think?
Anything brewing?

24:00.141 --> 24:03.805
- Nothing, no clue.
- What, no vibes?

24:03.978 --> 24:07.014
That's okay. We have all day.

24:18.575 --> 24:20.318
Remember asking me
about the Pick Six?

24:20.493 --> 24:23.908
- Yeah.
- See that guy over there?

24:24.080 --> 24:27.947
He's the expert. He's done it. Twice.

24:28.125 --> 24:29.500
- No kidding?
- Yeah.

24:29.668 --> 24:30.699
Hey, Duke.

24:34.381 --> 24:37.749
Nat, where you been
hiding yourself, pal?

24:37.926 --> 24:39.918
How them horses know
they crossed the finish line

24:40.095 --> 24:42.550
if they don't see you
standing there waiting for them?

24:42.722 --> 24:44.299
l want you to meet
some friends of mine.

24:44.474 --> 24:48.305
That's Brandon, Andrea and Steve,
this is my old pal, Duke Weatherill.

24:48.477 --> 24:51.762
Best handicapper
this side of Aqueduct.

24:51.939 --> 24:54.725
l'm just lucky. So you out here
for the sun or for the money?

24:54.900 --> 24:56.726
The money.

24:56.902 --> 24:58.561
Me too, guys.

24:58.737 --> 25:00.859
- Little girl's got a knack.
- Yeah?

25:01.030 --> 25:04.114
- Who do you like in this one?
- The seven horse.

25:04.283 --> 25:06.489
- Seven horse?
- Yeah, what do you think?

25:06.661 --> 25:08.285
Grande Amour.

25:08.454 --> 25:12.154
Just shipped in from Argentina,
8 to 1 .

25:12.332 --> 25:16.329
Grande Amour.
That means Big Love.

25:17.212 --> 25:18.754
Very good, Steve.

25:18.922 --> 25:20.332
So it's another in the series.

25:20.507 --> 25:26.924
First Lovesick, then Unrequited.
Now Grande Amour.

25:27.096 --> 25:28.969
Sounds like a bet to me.

25:29.139 --> 25:31.546
Nice to have met you.
See you at the finish line.

25:31.725 --> 25:33.847
- Good luck.
- Bye.

25:40.442 --> 25:43.608
- Hi.
- Twice in two days, David.

25:43.778 --> 25:45.320
ls this getting to be a regular thing?

25:45.488 --> 25:47.813
My dad called me
and said he needed to talk to me.

25:47.990 --> 25:49.270
lt sounded kind of important.

25:49.450 --> 25:53.529
Go on in. He's got a minute between
a root canal and an extraction.

25:53.704 --> 25:56.657
You know, l think you grew again.

26:01.711 --> 26:04.877
Hey, Dad. What are you doing?

26:07.299 --> 26:10.501
Just trying to figure out
how l messed my life up.

26:11.929 --> 26:13.588
What's wrong?

26:14.681 --> 26:18.215
- l just can't figure it out.
- What?

26:19.352 --> 26:22.685
- Jackie broke up with me, David.
- What?

26:24.106 --> 26:27.640
She just marched in here yesterday
and ended it.

26:28.861 --> 26:30.604
But why?

26:31.071 --> 26:32.814
Well, because...

26:36.660 --> 26:39.744
l don't know
if l can soften the blow on this one.

26:40.079 --> 26:42.486
Maybe l shouldn't even be
telling you.

26:49.213 --> 26:50.541
Jackie is pregnant.

26:53.550 --> 26:56.171
- l already know that.
- How do you know?

26:57.846 --> 26:59.126
lt's really complicated.

26:59.597 --> 27:03.808
- Kelly told you?
- No, not Kelly.

27:04.101 --> 27:06.093
- Donna.
- Donna?

27:06.270 --> 27:09.223
- Donna told-- How did Donna know?
- lt's a long story.

27:09.398 --> 27:12.813
l'm sure it is.
David, you could have told me.

27:13.360 --> 27:15.399
l thought you knew
and you didn't want to tell me.

27:15.570 --> 27:17.443
l would tell you
something like that, David.

27:20.074 --> 27:22.860
lt probably doesn't matter anyway.

27:23.661 --> 27:26.282
She's having this baby
and l'm out of the picture.

27:27.456 --> 27:29.163
Somehow, she's gotten it
into her head

27:29.333 --> 27:33.081
that the only reason l wanna marry her
is because she's pregnant.

27:35.380 --> 27:37.751
Do you know something about that?

27:41.010 --> 27:44.094
- l guess that's kind of my fault.
- Your fault?

27:44.263 --> 27:47.596
You see, l told Donna about the ring
because l was really excited.

27:47.766 --> 27:50.885
And then Donna probably told Kelly
and Kelly told Jackie and Brenda,

27:51.061 --> 27:52.887
- and Brenda told the Walsh's--
- Stop.

27:54.523 --> 27:56.266
l'm sorry, Dad.

27:57.359 --> 27:59.185
l didn't mean to mess anything up.

28:01.279 --> 28:02.856
l know.

28:03.864 --> 28:05.239
lt's not your fault.

28:09.745 --> 28:11.404
So, what are you gonna do?

28:17.877 --> 28:20.083
lf all else fails?

28:22.465 --> 28:23.923
Beg.

28:24.675 --> 28:26.916
They turn for home
and it's Ali's Knee on the lead

28:27.094 --> 28:30.011
but Grande Amour is now coming
with a strong run down at the rail.

28:30.180 --> 28:32.849
Eileen Forward's not doing enough

28:33.016 --> 28:36.301
and it's Grande Amour,
now doing best of all at the rail.

28:36.478 --> 28:39.051
Grande Amour and Ali's Knee,
these two are gonna fight it out

28:39.230 --> 28:41.222
but Grande Amour
is gonna go on to win it.

28:41.399 --> 28:44.068
And Grande Amour
has won it from Ali's Knee,

28:44.235 --> 28:46.725
Blair's Beast came late to get third.

28:49.073 --> 28:52.322
Andrea. Oh, man.

28:52.492 --> 28:54.283
That makes three in a row.

28:54.452 --> 28:55.994
God, Andrea, you're incredible.

28:56.162 --> 28:58.783
You know, l always knew
you were smart, but this is outrageous.

28:59.415 --> 29:01.241
l can't believe it either.

29:01.417 --> 29:05.034
Nice going, little lady.
That was very well done.

29:05.212 --> 29:06.836
l'm going to the cashier myself.

29:07.006 --> 29:09.461
- And l'm with you.
- All right.

29:09.633 --> 29:11.340
Come on, tell us.
How are you doing this?

29:11.510 --> 29:13.881
l don't know, it's just this feeling
that comes over me.

29:14.054 --> 29:17.303
- lt's kind of scary actually.
- Scary? What are you, nuts?

29:17.474 --> 29:18.588
You're making us rich.

29:18.766 --> 29:21.600
l don't know if l can do it again.
l don't know what it is l'm doing.

29:21.769 --> 29:22.966
Just don't over analyse it.

29:23.145 --> 29:27.189
Just go with it, you know,
find that Zen and cruise.

29:27.358 --> 29:28.686
Breathe through your eyes.

29:28.859 --> 29:31.266
- Let's go, bet, bet, bet, bet.
- Bet, bet, bet, bet, bet.

29:35.156 --> 29:38.405
- Oh, it's you.
- Hi, Kel.

29:38.576 --> 29:41.066
- ls your mother here?
- Mel, please, just go away.

29:41.245 --> 29:44.162
l don't wanna talk about this anymore.
l've made up my mind.

29:44.373 --> 29:45.535
Well, l haven't.

29:45.708 --> 29:48.198
Well, it's not your decision to make.
lt's mine.

29:48.377 --> 29:50.832
l'm gonna have this baby
whether you like it or not.

29:54.799 --> 29:55.913
What is her problem?

29:56.718 --> 29:58.793
Her hormones are in flux, Mel.

29:58.970 --> 30:01.258
l think it has a little bit to do
with being pregnant.

30:01.430 --> 30:03.422
Well, l wish you would talk
some sense into her.

30:03.599 --> 30:04.974
And what would you like me to say?

30:05.893 --> 30:09.427
Tell her that l don't wanna lose her.

30:10.897 --> 30:12.972
You know, you have a lot of nerve
coming here.

30:13.149 --> 30:15.307
You walk in,
you sweep her off her feet,

30:15.485 --> 30:17.892
and then because the two of you
can't keep your pants on,

30:18.071 --> 30:20.442
my whole life is about to fall apart.

30:20.615 --> 30:23.983
- How could you let this happen?
- We made a mistake.

30:24.160 --> 30:26.864
lt was stupid.
We should have been more careful.

30:27.037 --> 30:28.696
Words are cheap now, all right?

30:28.872 --> 30:29.903
Kelly, l love her.

30:31.208 --> 30:33.496
Then send her a Valentine.

30:33.752 --> 30:35.661
But then again,
l guess you already did.

30:43.385 --> 30:44.879
David, bike riding was a great idea.

30:45.054 --> 30:47.425
But you haven't said anything
for miles now.

30:47.598 --> 30:49.507
Yeah, well,
l've got a lot on my mind.

30:51.643 --> 30:54.394
Listen, l started this whole thing.
lt's my fault.

30:54.562 --> 30:57.396
There's no reason to apologise.
lt would've come out sooner or later.

30:57.899 --> 30:59.725
l can't believe she broke up with him.

30:59.901 --> 31:03.186
Yeah, well, my dad's miserable,
Jackie's miserable, Kelly's miserable,

31:03.362 --> 31:06.279
and l'm miserable and l don't
have anything to do with this.

31:06.448 --> 31:08.487
Wait a minute,
maybe l'm missing something here,

31:08.659 --> 31:11.944
but everyone's supposed to be happy
about this. Babies are wonderful.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.697
lf Mel was gonna ask
Jackie to marry him

31:13.872 --> 31:17.038
before he knew that she was pregnant,
why didn't he just tell her that?

31:17.667 --> 31:18.829
He tried.

31:19.001 --> 31:22.085
But first she didn't believe him.
And now she won't even talk to him.

31:23.297 --> 31:25.289
Well, maybe she'll talk to you.

31:33.139 --> 31:34.383
David, what are you doing here?

31:36.726 --> 31:38.599
l really need to talk to your mother.

31:39.061 --> 31:41.468
Your dad was already here
and she didn't wanna talk to him.

31:41.647 --> 31:43.390
What makes you think
she'd talk to you?

31:44.441 --> 31:47.394
- Just ask her, will you?
- lt's okay, honey.

31:47.569 --> 31:49.478
l'll talk to David.

31:54.159 --> 31:56.198
What's going on
with you and my dad?

31:57.078 --> 31:59.200
Kelly, will you give us a minute?

32:00.873 --> 32:03.659
David, l know this is hard for you.

32:03.834 --> 32:07.119
But believe me, l'm not trying to hurt
either you or your father.

32:07.296 --> 32:09.122
But you are. You're hurting him.

32:09.297 --> 32:10.577
When he was gonna marry you,

32:10.757 --> 32:14.172
he had a smile on his face
that l haven't seen in a long time.

32:14.719 --> 32:17.340
He's happy with you, Jackie.
Why are you doing this?

32:18.806 --> 32:23.965
David, your father has plans
that just don't include raising children.

32:24.144 --> 32:27.014
And l'm not gonna
take that away from him.

32:27.189 --> 32:29.430
l don't want him to marry me
just because l got pregnant

32:29.608 --> 32:30.722
and he thinks he has to.

32:31.359 --> 32:34.028
But l think he wants to be with you
and the baby.

32:34.195 --> 32:36.650
He wanted to marry you way before
he knew you were pregnant.

32:36.823 --> 32:38.198
You gotta believe me.

32:38.866 --> 32:41.107
But didn't you tell him
l was pregnant?

32:41.285 --> 32:43.491
No, l told Donna
that my dad wanted to marry you

32:43.662 --> 32:46.662
and she told me
that you were pregnant.

32:47.040 --> 32:48.202
l didn't even say anything.

32:48.375 --> 32:51.161
Even after my dad showed me
the ring he had bought you.

32:51.711 --> 32:53.917
But if you didn't tell him,
then who did?

32:55.048 --> 32:57.918
You did.
Before you broke up with him.

33:03.555 --> 33:05.346
Come on, it's Valentine's Day.

33:08.143 --> 33:10.218
Give cupid a break.

33:21.572 --> 33:24.406
Dylan, it's already Valentine's Day.
Tell me where we're going.

33:24.575 --> 33:25.772
Not until tonight.

33:25.951 --> 33:27.990
This is nuts. Give me another clue.

33:28.161 --> 33:30.734
Okay, it's not for kids.
ln fact, kids aren't even allowed.

33:30.914 --> 33:31.993
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:32.165 --> 33:37.206
Bren, you gotta be at least 1 7 years old
to do what we are gonna do tonight.

33:38.337 --> 33:39.416
Okay, we're heading out.

33:40.005 --> 33:42.674
Wow, Mrs. Walsh. You look great.

33:43.175 --> 33:44.717
Well, thank you, Dylan.

33:44.885 --> 33:47.719
So where are you guys off to?

33:47.888 --> 33:51.007
Oh, Dad's taking me to an early
Valentine's Day dinner at the beach.

33:51.182 --> 33:53.388
We're gonna miss the sunset
if we don't skedaddle.

33:53.560 --> 33:55.967
- Have a good time.
- Will you be here when we get back?

33:56.145 --> 33:58.386
Ask him.
l don't even know where we're going.

33:58.564 --> 34:04.020
Well, your plans don't involve anything
dangerous or, you know, risque?

34:04.194 --> 34:05.736
- Dad.
- Hey.

34:05.904 --> 34:09.853
l promise you, we will be
well taken care of in a public place, sir.

34:10.449 --> 34:12.406
Thank you, Dylan.

34:13.620 --> 34:16.822
Lying down, in a public place,
where you have to be 1 7,

34:16.998 --> 34:20.580
while enjoying something red,
warm and close to the heart.

34:21.043 --> 34:23.284
Keep guessing,
l'll pick you up at 7.

34:23.462 --> 34:26.295
Come on, at least tell me what to wear.
ls it dressy, casual, what?

34:26.465 --> 34:28.670
Wear anything you want.

34:30.135 --> 34:33.384
Oh, actually, Bren, you know what?
Wear short sleeves.

34:41.812 --> 34:44.385
The horses are now in the paddock
for our next race.

34:44.565 --> 34:45.596
A reminder that we do--

34:46.233 --> 34:48.603
Come on, Andrea. What's wrong?
You were doing great.

34:48.777 --> 34:50.899
l don't know,
l just haven't felt any twinges.

34:51.071 --> 34:53.905
Since the third race. We've been
here all day. We could've been rich.

34:54.072 --> 34:55.152
Should've been rich.

34:55.324 --> 34:58.408
Come on, come on, go easy.
You can't push this kind of thing.

34:58.577 --> 35:00.735
Yeah, you don't want me
giving you any bad tips.

35:00.913 --> 35:05.124
Besides, we all agreed. We'd only
make a bet when Andrea was sure.

35:05.709 --> 35:07.867
lt's the last race, what do you think?

35:08.044 --> 35:10.202
l don't know.

35:14.675 --> 35:16.169
- Oh, my God.
- What?

35:16.344 --> 35:19.013
- What, what?
- This is it, right here.

35:19.972 --> 35:22.260
A filly named Cupid's Wing.

35:22.433 --> 35:25.718
- Are you sure? This is it?
- l guess.

35:25.894 --> 35:29.179
Cupid's Wing on Valentine's Day.
lt's too good, we can't lose.

35:29.356 --> 35:31.348
That's it, we go for broke.
We take Cupid's Wing,

35:31.524 --> 35:33.563
put all our earnings on it and win.

35:33.735 --> 35:37.399
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
This filly's an 80 to 1 shot.

35:37.571 --> 35:39.527
She hasn't come in
in her last six races.

35:39.698 --> 35:45.201
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah. l mean, l think so.

35:46.913 --> 35:48.704
Okay, l'm going to the window.

35:48.873 --> 35:50.746
- Right-o.
- Okay.

35:51.292 --> 35:53.782
You know, all this handicapping,
it's making me very hungry.

35:53.961 --> 35:55.289
- ln fact, l'm starving.
- Me too.

35:55.463 --> 35:57.621
Why don't we go get dogs
and we'll meet you back here?

35:57.798 --> 35:58.829
- Okay.
- Cool.

35:59.008 --> 36:01.047
- You be all right?
- You bet.

36:09.100 --> 36:10.510
Ladies and gentlemen,

36:10.685 --> 36:12.843
the jockeys now out in the paddock
for the next race.

36:13.021 --> 36:14.349
They will be mounting shortly.

36:14.522 --> 36:16.680
And the runners
for today's next race--

36:16.857 --> 36:19.526
- Hi.
- Hey, lady luck.

36:19.693 --> 36:22.314
So, what are your fortunes
for the next six furlongs?

36:22.488 --> 36:24.978
That one, Cupid's Wing.

36:25.157 --> 36:29.569
Really. Well, l guess
it being Valentine's Day and all.

36:29.744 --> 36:31.535
What's wrong?

36:32.580 --> 36:33.611
lt's a sucker bet.

36:34.457 --> 36:35.488
What do you mean?

36:36.083 --> 36:39.119
l don't mean to throw your game,
sweetheart,

36:39.336 --> 36:42.372
but that filly's way out of her class.

36:42.548 --> 36:45.548
- That's what Nat said.
- Well, he was right.

36:45.717 --> 36:47.626
You see, this is what they call
a claiming race.

36:47.802 --> 36:49.628
That means
all the horses are for sale.

36:49.804 --> 36:51.048
The owner of that horse

36:51.222 --> 36:53.795
just hopes somebody's gonna
take her off his hands.

36:53.975 --> 36:56.133
That's the only reason
she's in that race.

36:56.310 --> 36:58.101
You mean there's no way
she can win?

36:58.270 --> 36:59.598
She might.

36:59.772 --> 37:04.647
But l gotta tell you,
that nag, one leg shy of a set.

37:09.531 --> 37:11.322
Oh, Nat, l'm so glad
l found you in time.

37:11.491 --> 37:14.277
- Why? What is it?
- You can't bet. l was wrong.

37:14.452 --> 37:15.566
Come on, we're on a roll.

37:15.745 --> 37:19.445
l know, but l ran into your friend Duke,
he told me the horse is a real loser.

37:19.623 --> 37:20.654
- Duke said that?
- Yeah.

37:20.833 --> 37:22.908
He knows what he's talking about,
l don't know what l'm doing.

37:23.085 --> 37:24.282
lt's just stupid guessing.

37:24.461 --> 37:28.374
He said to put your money down
on the six horse, Follow Me Home.

37:29.674 --> 37:31.049
Follow Me Home.

37:32.135 --> 37:35.835
That's 5 to 1 .
What are you trying to do, jinx this?

37:36.013 --> 37:38.254
Jinx has nothing to do with this.

37:38.432 --> 37:42.808
This information came straight
from the horse's mouth, so to speak.

37:42.978 --> 37:46.891
Look, Cupid's Wing's is still 80 to 1 .
Do you know what that means?

37:47.065 --> 37:48.808
Do you have any idea
how much we could make?

37:48.983 --> 37:52.149
l'm sorry, Nat.
l just can't let you bet, l can't.

37:52.320 --> 37:55.106
Oh, come on, don't do it to me.
Not now.

37:55.281 --> 37:56.775
Next.

38:07.917 --> 38:10.324
Well? What did you do?

38:10.503 --> 38:12.625
Oh, ask me after the race.

38:16.383 --> 38:17.841
And away we go.

38:18.010 --> 38:20.251
General Lyon and Holly Knoll
came out well.

38:20.429 --> 38:24.046
Now Cupid's Wing
is going to the lead.

38:24.224 --> 38:28.552
Follow Me Home now goes up
to join the leaders on the outside.

38:30.730 --> 38:32.852
Down the back stretch they go
and now Cupid's--

38:33.024 --> 38:34.518
Come on, Cupid's Wing.

38:34.692 --> 38:36.980
Come on, Follow Me Home.

38:37.152 --> 38:41.564
Come on, Cupid's Wing.
Come on, come on, take it, take it.

38:41.740 --> 38:44.277
Come on, Cupid's Wing.
Come on.

38:44.451 --> 38:47.902
- Come on, baby.
- Come on, Cupid's Wing.

38:48.079 --> 38:50.486
- What did you do, Nat?
- Let's go, let's go.

38:50.665 --> 38:54.282
Follow Me Home,
General Lyon is now finishing fast.

38:54.460 --> 38:57.330
And Cupid's Wing is now tired,
she can fly no more.

38:57.504 --> 38:59.211
And Cupid's Wing is dropping out.

38:59.381 --> 39:01.337
Follow Me Home
coming home strongly.

39:01.508 --> 39:03.583
- And Follow Me Home--
- Come on, come on.

39:03.760 --> 39:06.085
Good for nothing bag of bones.

39:10.641 --> 39:13.131
- l can't believe it.
- Great, Andrea.

39:13.311 --> 39:15.054
Remind me never to take you
to Las Vegas.

39:15.229 --> 39:17.268
Quit giving her a hard time.

39:17.439 --> 39:19.478
Yeah, don't blame me.
l tried to tell him.

39:19.650 --> 39:21.938
Well, l hope you took my advice.

39:23.111 --> 39:24.984
l don't know. Did we?

39:25.155 --> 39:29.366
And the official winner of today's
third race, Follow Me Home.

39:29.534 --> 39:30.909
Follow Me Home, the winner.

39:31.077 --> 39:34.908
We did. Follow Me Home, boys.

39:35.081 --> 39:36.990
Dinner's on me.

39:37.166 --> 39:38.410
- l don't get it.
- Me either.

39:38.584 --> 39:40.042
We won.

39:40.210 --> 39:42.119
Do you understand
what just happened here?

39:42.295 --> 39:43.374
l have no idea.

39:43.547 --> 39:46.713
Well, that's because this little girl's
smarter than all of us put together.

39:47.217 --> 39:50.301
And l figured out
another secret about this game.

39:50.470 --> 39:53.755
- Yeah, what?
- Quit while you're ahead.

39:53.931 --> 39:55.093
Smart girl.

39:58.352 --> 39:59.680
Cash in.

40:07.944 --> 40:10.980
- Hi, Mel.
- Jackie.

40:11.155 --> 40:14.523
l hope l'm not interrupting. l know
the last time l came l kind of barged in.

40:14.700 --> 40:15.731
l'm sorry.

40:21.289 --> 40:23.696
l'm really glad to see you.

40:23.875 --> 40:26.579
- How do you feel?
- Fine.

40:27.086 --> 40:30.122
- l talked to David, Mel.
- l know, he told me.

40:30.298 --> 40:31.792
ls it true then?

40:31.966 --> 40:34.883
Did you really wanna marry me
before you knew l was pregnant?

40:35.052 --> 40:38.254
Yes. l kept trying to tell you that.

40:38.430 --> 40:42.758
l made such a fool of myself.
l'm so sorry.

40:42.934 --> 40:44.593
lt's okay.

40:45.061 --> 40:47.598
lt's one of the things
l love about you, you're passionate.

40:47.772 --> 40:48.969
And all those things you said

40:49.148 --> 40:52.314
about how happy you were
that David and Kelly are grown up?

40:52.485 --> 40:53.860
They're grown up.

40:54.028 --> 40:56.649
But there's a baby coming
that needs us.

40:57.531 --> 41:00.317
- Both of us.
- Oh, Mel.

41:12.461 --> 41:14.120
Hang on a minute.

41:15.547 --> 41:19.875
Arlene, there's a box on my desk,
could you bring it in here please?

41:20.052 --> 41:21.711
What are you up to?

41:21.887 --> 41:24.923
There's something
that l've been meaning to give you.

41:26.724 --> 41:28.266
Here it is.

41:28.434 --> 41:29.809
Thank you, Arlene.

41:33.814 --> 41:35.521
Thank you, Arlene.

41:35.733 --> 41:38.437
Sorry, l'll be at the desk
if you need me.

41:44.407 --> 41:49.531
l was gonna wait until tonight
to give this to you, but what the hell.

41:52.081 --> 41:53.539
l wanna marry you, Jackie.

41:53.707 --> 41:56.458
l wanna spend the rest of my life
with you and our child.

41:57.419 --> 41:58.699
Will you marry me?

41:59.713 --> 42:03.128
Oh, Mel. Yes.

42:03.300 --> 42:05.256
Yes.

42:14.143 --> 42:15.934
Thank you.

42:17.020 --> 42:19.937
- Happy Valentine's Day.
- Happy Valentine's Day.

42:20.148 --> 42:23.350
Okay, you've kept me in suspense
long enough.

42:23.568 --> 42:24.599
Where are we going?

42:24.819 --> 42:26.728
We are going to a play.

42:26.946 --> 42:29.234
- A play?
- Yeah, it's called Love Letters.

42:29.448 --> 42:31.072
lt's about a man and a woman

42:31.283 --> 42:33.608
who are in love with each other
for a lifetime.

42:33.786 --> 42:35.742
Although they never really
get together,

42:35.954 --> 42:38.824
their love is so strong
that it grows in spite of them.

42:39.458 --> 42:42.577
- Dylan, it sounds beautiful.
- Oh, it is.

42:42.752 --> 42:43.783
But l don't get it.

42:43.962 --> 42:45.871
What does a play have to do
with those clues?

42:46.589 --> 42:49.340
Well, the play's not the only place
we're going tonight.

42:49.509 --> 42:51.880
We are gonna go
someplace else first.

42:55.431 --> 42:57.838
Oh, Kel, how sweet.
Steve sent you a Valentine's Day card.

42:58.016 --> 43:01.680
Yup. Good thing l sent him one.

43:01.853 --> 43:03.975
Dinner is almost ready.

43:04.147 --> 43:07.183
Wait, l wanna make a toast.

43:08.025 --> 43:09.981
Sparkling cider all around.

43:11.112 --> 43:12.819
To new beginnings.

43:13.530 --> 43:15.273
To you, Jackie.

43:15.449 --> 43:17.571
And to babies born of love.

43:17.743 --> 43:21.194
Well, this is one Valentine's Day
l'll never forget.

43:21.371 --> 43:23.410
See, Kel?
l told you everything would work out.

43:24.249 --> 43:26.205
Yeah, l guess it did.

43:27.251 --> 43:29.243
Well, if you guys
are getting married,

43:29.462 --> 43:33.162
that means you two
are brother and sister.

43:33.340 --> 43:34.620
Oh, my God.

43:40.680 --> 43:41.924
Donating blood?

43:42.098 --> 43:44.884
You know, l never would have
guessed this in a million years.

43:45.059 --> 43:48.593
Well, it's like l said. You gotta be 1 7,
we will be lying down,

43:48.771 --> 43:52.270
and blood is warm,
red, and close to your heart.

43:52.441 --> 43:54.267
lt's probably a good thing
you kept it secret

43:54.443 --> 43:57.147
because l just might not have come.

43:57.321 --> 44:00.689
Bren, l know you're scared,
but it's not that big a deal, really.

44:00.907 --> 44:02.317
Yeah.

44:02.992 --> 44:05.447
Actually, l've been wanting to do it
for a long time.

44:05.620 --> 44:07.742
When l was a kid,
l was in an automobile accident.

44:07.914 --> 44:11.578
My head went through the windshield.
That's how l got the scar.

44:11.750 --> 44:13.160
l needed a lot of blood.

44:13.335 --> 44:16.169
Anyway, l decided
that when l got older,

44:16.338 --> 44:18.129
l'd give some back.

44:18.298 --> 44:21.168
l thought you'd wanna do it with me.

44:21.343 --> 44:22.374
But why tonight?

44:23.636 --> 44:26.589
The accident happened
on Valentine's Day.

44:31.685 --> 44:33.344
Dylan, it's weird.

44:33.520 --> 44:35.311
But somehow,
this is the most romantic thing

44:35.481 --> 44:37.437
we could ever have done together.

44:37.941 --> 44:39.767
Happy Valentine's Day, Bren.

44:40.569 --> 44:42.810
Happy Valentine's Day.
