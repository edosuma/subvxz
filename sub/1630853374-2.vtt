[intense music playing]

00:15.516 --> 00:16.515
[cell phone ringing]

00:17.818 --> 00:19.118
[shane] hey, jake.
What's up, buddy?

00:19.120 --> 00:20.619
[jake over phone] <i> hey,</i>
<i> how's it going, guys?</i>

00:21.522 --> 00:22.721
[josh] so,
how's the boat coming?

00:23.691 --> 00:25.624
[jake] <i> it's going good.</i>

00:25.626 --> 00:28.494
<i> We got the mains in.</i>
<i> We got the new generator.</i>

00:28.496 --> 00:31.263
<i> Boat's looking tip-top.</i>

00:31.365 --> 00:33.198
Looking like she did
back in her heyday.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.534
Actually, better than
she'd looked in her heyday.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.203
Oh, right on.
That's great to hear, pal.

00:38.205 --> 00:40.506
[jake] <i> you know, the old ma</i>
<i> would be, uh, tickled to dea</i>

00:40.508 --> 00:44.309
<i> To see how everything's</i>
<i> coming together.</i>

00:44.311 --> 00:47.112
<i> Now, I'm going out there.</i>
<i> Got muscles out there</i>
<i> with you.</i>

00:47.114 --> 00:48.247
[josh and shane laugh]

00:48.315 --> 00:50.516
You need those muscles
to rein in those big fish.

00:50.518 --> 00:53.052
I'm telling you, man.
Those things are a struggle
to get in a boat.

00:54.055 --> 00:57.056
[josh] <i> 3,000 pounds a week.</i>
<i> Every week.</i>

00:57.124 --> 01:00.959
That's the contract we made
with these restaurants
back on the mainland.

01:00.995 --> 01:03.228
<i> My older brother, shane,</i>
<i> agreed to stick around</i>
<i> and help,</i>

01:03.230 --> 01:05.297
<i> And we are busting our asses</i>

01:05.299 --> 01:07.900
<i> But we've come light</i>
<i> on ahi tuna two weeks</i>
<i> in a row.</i>

01:09.103 --> 01:10.436
We're just
not catching enough.

01:10.504 --> 01:13.439
We got a lot of variety.
We just need more quantity.

01:13.540 --> 01:17.342
Kind of at a loss right now
what, uh... What to do, bud.

01:21.949 --> 01:24.583
Maybe you guys take a note
from the old man, and, uh,

01:24.585 --> 01:26.718
<i> Get some more pots</i>
<i> in the water.</i>

01:26.720 --> 01:29.755
-[intense music playing]
-all right. That's actually
a pretty good idea.

01:29.823 --> 01:31.457
I don't know
how we're gonna do that yet.

01:31.558 --> 01:33.292
[jake] <i> you guys</i>
<i> will figure it out.</i>

01:33.294 --> 01:36.962
<i> The harris bros always seem</i>
<i> to get the job done.</i>

01:36.964 --> 01:39.231
[josh] <i> we're gonna have</i>
<i> to figure out how to catch</i>
<i> a lot more fish.</i>

01:40.701 --> 01:42.501
Yeah! Boom!

01:42.503 --> 01:44.403
<i> I am captain josh harris.</i>

01:44.405 --> 01:46.105
I keep looking
at that picture,

01:46.107 --> 01:47.940
And he keeps
looking back at me.

01:48.008 --> 01:50.008
<i> Phil harris was my father</i>

01:50.010 --> 01:51.710
<i> And a legend</i>
<i> on the bering sea.</i>

01:51.712 --> 01:55.814
[phil] <i> I'm a sweetheart.</i>
<i> You can't get</i>
<i> any better than me.</i>

01:55.816 --> 01:57.916
I'm just
a smilin' [bleep] jack.

01:57.918 --> 02:00.853
[josh] <i> little did he know,</i>
<i> I'd be chasing his dream</i>

02:00.921 --> 02:02.087
<i> Of an off-season</i>
<i> fishing business.</i>

02:02.089 --> 02:03.322
[man] oh, wow.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.691
[jeff] right now.
In the boat, in the boat.

02:05.693 --> 02:07.960
-[josh] yes!
-[jeff] that's the one
we're looking for.

02:07.962 --> 02:11.263
[josh] <i> I reunited</i>
<i> with my brother, shane,</i>
<i> which puts us in position--</i>

02:11.332 --> 02:13.098
-Let's do it.
-Whoa, [bleep]. Sorry, buddy.

02:13.100 --> 02:15.000
...To build on dad's legacy.

02:15.002 --> 02:17.603
Green-stick fishing,
here we come.

02:17.605 --> 02:20.506
<i> The old man</i>
<i> always made it look</i>
<i> easier than it is.</i>

02:20.508 --> 02:22.207
-[snaps]
-[man exclaims]

02:22.209 --> 02:25.410
To get 3,000 pounds a week
might just break us.

02:25.412 --> 02:27.446
-[jeff] here we go.
-[kodi] whoa, [bleep].
Watch out!

02:27.448 --> 02:28.714
[josh] holy [bleep].

02:28.716 --> 02:30.816
-[jeff] slow down, slow down.
-What the [bleep] is going on?

02:30.818 --> 02:31.817
[snaps]

02:31.819 --> 02:32.551
[exclaims]

02:32.653 --> 02:33.619
[wails]

02:34.855 --> 02:36.054
[jeff] crazy day.

02:43.964 --> 02:44.963
[intense music playing]

02:57.211 --> 02:58.376
So, what's the plan, man?

02:59.713 --> 03:02.114
[casey] you know,
we gotta catch
more fish faster.

03:02.116 --> 03:04.917
[josh] I mean, what,
do we change up,
like, location?

03:04.919 --> 03:06.618
I don't know.
I don't know
this island well enough.

03:08.422 --> 03:11.557
[josh] <i> we came north</i>
<i> to kauai to escape</i>
<i> the packed grounds in kona</i>

03:11.625 --> 03:14.760
And to catch the school of ahi
before they migrate south.

03:16.030 --> 03:18.530
<i> But, so far,</i>
<i> we haven't landed them</i>
<i> in big numbers.</i>

03:20.034 --> 03:21.934
Hey, kodi, you guys run
the stick out here?

03:21.936 --> 03:25.037
I have, but I don't have
a setup for one right now.

03:25.739 --> 03:26.939
[josh] what is that?

03:27.007 --> 03:28.407
Uh, basically,
another technique

03:28.409 --> 03:30.309
You can use fishing
if the fishing's calling
for it.

03:30.311 --> 03:33.045
You got a big, tall stick,
keeps your lines all elevated

03:33.146 --> 03:36.014
Out of the water
with some danglers
dangling in.

03:36.016 --> 03:38.217
[josh] I'm not
quite following.

03:38.219 --> 03:39.618
[kodi] you know what?
Draw you a quick sketch.

03:39.620 --> 03:42.721
-[josh] okay.
-[kodi] basically,
your boat's here.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.190
You got your stick
here in the air.

03:45.192 --> 03:47.559
Your hydraulic reel
with the line coming off.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.261
And there's danglers
coming off of it.

03:50.431 --> 03:52.030
That's good stuff.

03:52.032 --> 03:54.299
-[intense music playing]
-[jeff] you know, if we run
over a pile of tuna,

03:54.301 --> 03:58.704
And we set the stick out,
you know, we could use
a hydraulic hauler

03:58.706 --> 04:01.340
And we run multiple baits,
and, if they're gonna bite,

04:01.441 --> 04:04.810
I mean, we could put on
a lot of weight really,
really quick.

04:04.812 --> 04:06.245
Yeah, we should try that.

04:07.948 --> 04:10.649
[josh] casey, you think
you could locate us
one of these things?

04:10.751 --> 04:13.151
-I'm already
looking for one, man.
-[josh] awesome.

04:13.187 --> 04:15.454
[jeff] so the sticks
can be very productive,

04:15.555 --> 04:17.389
But they can
be very dangerous.

04:17.391 --> 04:21.660
If you're not paying attention
at all times, it's really easy
to get pulled overboard,

04:21.728 --> 04:22.961
Get hooked, get cut.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.865
[josh] trial by fire, huh?

04:26.933 --> 04:31.703
Well, crab fishing,
the old man would always say,
"get more pots in water."

04:31.705 --> 04:33.105
Take more chances.

04:36.944 --> 04:37.976
[intense music playing]

04:43.751 --> 04:45.951
[jeff] okay,
so where's the stick, exactly?

04:45.953 --> 04:47.552
[man over speakerphone] <i> uh,</i>
<i> it's in the yard.</i>

04:47.554 --> 04:49.855
[jeff] okay, sounds good.
We'll take a look at it,
and we'll let you know.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.423
[man] <i> okay, let me know.</i>

04:51.425 --> 04:54.793
You know, it's a green stick.
It's available.
It's secondhand.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.828
It's reasonably priced.

04:56.830 --> 05:00.532
So this might be...
This might be what we need.

05:01.302 --> 05:02.534
We're gonna just go
see what we got.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.305
[josh] <i> a used piece</i>
<i> of fishing gear</i>

05:06.307 --> 05:08.507
<i> Isn't exactly at the top</i>
<i> of my christmas list.</i>

05:08.509 --> 05:10.208
But, since we're just
testing this out,

05:10.210 --> 05:12.244
We decided to put a grand
down on a used one

05:12.313 --> 05:15.314
Instead of 10 grand
down on a brand-new one.

05:15.316 --> 05:17.949
And, in the pictures,
this thing looked like
it was gray.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.851
-What's up with that?
-Yeah, so...

05:19.920 --> 05:23.188
This green-stick method
of fishing actually originated
in japan.

05:23.190 --> 05:25.557
They used to run
big bamboo sticks.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.826
Obviously, bamboo's green.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.796
So that was where the name
of the green stick came from.

05:30.798 --> 05:32.230
You know, now
they've been modified.

05:32.232 --> 05:34.900
They're made out
of carbon fiber, fiberglass.

05:34.902 --> 05:37.102
You know,
by the looks of, probably,
what you'd seen,

05:37.104 --> 05:39.404
I would say that it's probably
a fiberglass stick.

05:46.613 --> 05:48.213
[josh] oh, yep.
There it is.
Right there, case.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.116
-[casey] that's it, huh?
-[jeff] this is it.

05:51.118 --> 05:53.652
-[shane] hmm.
-[josh] this is the big buy.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.020
[jeff] doesn't look too bad.

05:56.223 --> 06:00.826
This is the base.
This base balance
on the boat, like this.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.627
So, how does it check out?
In good condition?

06:02.629 --> 06:05.330
The only way we'll really know
how good it's gonna work
is when we run it.

06:05.332 --> 06:07.699
[casey] let's just do it.
We don't have time
to mess around.

06:07.701 --> 06:08.800
-[jeff] all right.
-Let's go.

06:14.508 --> 06:15.907
[suspenseful music playing]

06:23.517 --> 06:26.218
[josh] here, shane.
You wanna grab the base
and follow casey?

06:26.220 --> 06:27.419
[shane] okay.

06:30.424 --> 06:31.723
[casey exhales]

06:31.725 --> 06:33.825
Here you go. We got a stick.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.660
How... How big is the base
on that?

06:36.430 --> 06:37.829
They're not universal?

06:37.831 --> 06:40.298
[huffs] one size
doesn't fit all.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.500
It's about 5 inches.

06:42.703 --> 06:43.601
[kodi] let's give it a test.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.205
The old man
would take some risks.

06:47.207 --> 06:49.608
We're gonna risk a little bit
on this green stick
right here.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.012
Are you guys feeling lucky?

06:54.014 --> 06:56.448
It didn't matter
if he was setting pots,
driving fast...

06:57.951 --> 06:59.151
<i> My dad was a gambler.</i>

07:00.354 --> 07:02.421
Yeah, he taught me to drive
in his corvette.

07:02.423 --> 07:06.258
This car here was $95,000
when it was new.

07:06.326 --> 07:10.629
-I was 15 and a half,
and, uh, I was terrified.
-[josh chuckles]

07:10.631 --> 07:14.032
[shane] <i> there was</i>
<i> no directions. It was just..</i>
<i> Throws me the keys.</i>

07:14.134 --> 07:16.134
I'm like, "what's this for?"
he was like, "oh,
you're driving."

07:16.203 --> 07:18.103
I was like, "no, I'm not."
you know? [chuckles]

07:18.105 --> 07:19.604
I'm not driving your car.
You love this car.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.006
He was like,
"well, don't wreck it."

07:21.008 --> 07:22.707
-[laughing]
-you know?

07:25.245 --> 07:27.712
-[josh] <i> that is a gambling</i>
<i> move right there.</i>
-I wouldn't have gambled that.

07:27.714 --> 07:29.113
-No way.
-[chuckles]

07:30.551 --> 07:33.718
Well, you know,
you took a risk, and, well,
you succeeded.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.821
I think
we're about to do the same.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.924
This is supposed
to be our savior, eh?

07:38.926 --> 07:40.091
[shane] I think
it's gonna work.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.593
It's gonna put bait
in the water.

07:41.661 --> 07:44.930
It's gonna make us
more money, and, uh,
we're gonna catch bigger fish.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.201
-[casey] we're pretty much
ready to go, yeah?
-You guys done?

07:49.203 --> 07:50.035
Let's go fishing.

07:54.408 --> 07:55.807
Boo-yeah.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.309
Green-stick fishing,
here we come.

07:57.911 --> 07:58.910
[kodi exclaims]

07:59.546 --> 08:00.779
[intense music playing]

08:11.525 --> 08:13.625
[josh] well, we're gonna start
at the 40-fathom ledge.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.827
It's pretty close.
There's a lot of action there.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.763
A lot of fish
have been running up shallow.
Let's see what happens.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.805
So we're sticking with
the traditional method
of trolling

08:26.807 --> 08:28.406
While those guys try out
that stick.

08:28.408 --> 08:30.408
See how that goes for them.

08:30.410 --> 08:34.346
<i> The 40-fathom ledge is wher</i>
<i> we caught the biggest ahi</i>
<i> in kauai so far.</i>

08:34.414 --> 08:38.517
Because the shelf drops off,
the current comes in
and creates a nice upwelling.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.719
<i> And it could attract a schoo</i>

08:40.721 --> 08:42.521
<i> But, since we only have</i>
<i> one stick,</i>

08:42.523 --> 08:44.823
<i> Shane and I,</i>
<i> we're gonna stick</i>
<i> to rod and reel.</i>

08:44.825 --> 08:46.190
<i> Pull in whatever we can.</i>

08:46.292 --> 08:48.660
Hopefully,
we can hit some fish
while they're hitting theirs.

08:48.762 --> 08:52.230
But, one way or another,
I'm looking forward to see
what that stick can do.

08:55.502 --> 08:57.802
So this is the first thing
that we put in the water.
It's the bird.

08:57.804 --> 09:00.572
-Okay?
-So what is this "bird"
gonna do?

09:00.574 --> 09:02.340
So, if you look
at the stick now,

09:02.409 --> 09:04.376
It's just sitting
perfectly vertical.

09:04.378 --> 09:06.711
This actually makes
the stick bend over

09:06.713 --> 09:08.513
So that the base
dangle in the water.

09:08.515 --> 09:09.948
-Okay.
-All right? You ready, buddy?

09:09.950 --> 09:11.216
I'm gonna throw this thing in.

09:14.621 --> 09:16.054
Okay, you can go ahead
and go in that bucket,

09:16.056 --> 09:17.222
And let's get
some of those squids out.

09:18.125 --> 09:20.058
<i> Green-sticking</i>
<i> is pretty simple,</i>

09:20.060 --> 09:24.195
But it's a pretty
creative method
on catching tunas really fast.

09:24.197 --> 09:26.665
<i> The line runs</i>
<i> from the top of the stick,</i>

09:26.700 --> 09:31.336
<i> About 600 feet</i>
<i> back to the drag,</i>
<i> what's called the bird.</i>

09:31.405 --> 09:36.541
<i> Dangling in between,</i>
<i> about four or five lures.</i>
<i> They dance on the surface.</i>

09:36.577 --> 09:40.946
<i> As the boat moves forward,</i>
<i> the tuna sees that bird</i>
<i> as competition.</i>

09:41.014 --> 09:44.416
<i> Their natural instinct</i>
<i> is to get to that bait first</i>

09:44.418 --> 09:46.318
<i> And, before you know it,</i>
<i> it's a feeding frenzy.</i>

09:48.956 --> 09:51.556
We are ready to go,
whenever you are.

09:51.658 --> 09:52.724
[kodi] all right,
let's roll, boys.

09:55.462 --> 09:56.595
[intense music playing]

10:01.335 --> 10:04.302
Hey, kodi, I see some birds
over there on that side.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.205
[exclaims] it looks
actually really good out here.

10:10.544 --> 10:12.310
-[shane] okay. Come in
a little tighter.
-[casey] yep.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.946
[shane] <i> we got some belly.</i>
<i> We got some bend.</i>

10:18.952 --> 10:20.352
[alapai] we're on.
Got it, buddy. We're on.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.420
We're on. Right here. [bleep]

10:23.423 --> 10:25.123
-[casey] all right.
-[shane] top looks clear.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.359
-We're on. We're on.
-[casey] get your clicker off.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.430
-[alapai over radio]
<i> we found him.</i>
-Huh?

10:32.432 --> 10:34.799
[bleep] mutant
was coming out. [chuckling]

10:36.403 --> 10:37.836
[casey] I have a feeling
it's an ono.

10:41.608 --> 10:43.908
-It came off? No, you got him.
-[shane] no, I got him.

10:43.910 --> 10:46.211
He just wasn't gonna come
this way for a minute there.

10:49.216 --> 10:51.149
[shane] okay. Coming up.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.817
-[casey] oh, ono!
-[shane exclaims]

10:54.421 --> 10:56.554
-[alapai] ono. Big ono.
-[casey] nice ono.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.724
Hey, watch yourself coming in.
If you get bored with him,
then I could trade you out.

10:59.726 --> 11:01.126
[alapai] here,
you gotta bring him forward.

11:01.128 --> 11:02.761
Whoa, whoa, you gotta keep him
in the water.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.601
[casey chuckling] he decided
to bring his own ass
out of the water.

11:09.603 --> 11:11.836
-[shane] yeah.
-[alapai] nice fish, though.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.405
-Here you go.
-[shane] thank you.

11:13.407 --> 11:16.207
This isn't the ahi
we wanted, but it's a fish.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.910
[alapai] nice one,
boys. Score.

11:23.116 --> 11:24.916
[casey] we haven't heard much
from them on the radio.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.418
[shane] 'cause they're
too busy reeling in fish!

11:26.420 --> 11:28.319
[casey] that's kind of
what I'm thinking, maybe.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.628
-[rumbling]
-[jeff] whoa, slow down.

11:36.630 --> 11:37.962
-[kodi] slowing down.
-[jeff] yeah, we're on.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.199
[josh] hey, dude,
we got fish on. We got one.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.635
-[kodi] <i> hey, we're on.</i>
-[all] <i> we're on.</i>

11:43.737 --> 11:45.537
[jeff] all right, josh.
Let's get a couple gaps.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.539
-Here we go.
-[snaps]

11:47.640 --> 11:49.240
[kodi] whoa! Watch out! Whoa!

11:49.342 --> 11:51.543
[josh] dude. Holy crap.

11:51.611 --> 11:53.244
[kodi] we just lost
our top section.

11:53.346 --> 11:55.814
-The green stick is broken.
-[kodi] it [bleep]
broke, dude.

11:55.816 --> 11:58.049
[josh] it snapped
and then it shattered.

12:02.522 --> 12:04.055
[all] we're on.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.957
[jeff] all right, josh.
Let's get a couple gaps.

12:06.026 --> 12:07.058
-Here we go.
-[snaps]

12:07.127 --> 12:08.760
[kodi] whoa! Watch out! Whoa!

12:08.828 --> 12:11.062
[josh] dude. Holy crap.

12:11.131 --> 12:12.764
[kodi] we just lost
our top section.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.300
-The green stick is broken.
-[kodi] it [bleep]
broke, dude.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.502
[josh] it snapped
and then it shattered.

12:20.107 --> 12:23.308
Oh, [bleep]!
Are you kidding me?

12:24.911 --> 12:27.445
I'm pulling in
what's left of the end.

12:29.783 --> 12:31.716
Holy moly.

12:31.718 --> 12:33.518
-[josh] dude. Yeah.
-[kodi exclaims]

12:33.520 --> 12:35.053
[josh] she snapped.

12:35.122 --> 12:37.722
Yeah. She's toast.

12:37.724 --> 12:39.958
Have you ever seen
anything like this
happen before?

12:40.059 --> 12:42.861
I've never seen a stick
broken in my life.

12:42.962 --> 12:45.563
[josh] one thing
about harris luck:
It comes in many forms.

12:45.665 --> 12:47.365
-[kodi chuckles]
-today, it was unlucky.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.933
[kodi chuckles] unlucky.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.935
[josh] <i> well, if you're keepi</i>
<i> track at home, folks,</i>

12:51.004 --> 12:55.206
That is $1,000
for one green stick
and one ono.

12:55.208 --> 12:59.043
-Which I caught.
-Yeah. And zero ahi,

12:59.145 --> 13:02.180
Which leaves us
with a grand total
of 2,900 pounds

13:02.182 --> 13:03.815
<i> Left to catch</i>
<i> for the order this week.</i>

13:05.218 --> 13:06.951
That could have
been catastrophic.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.020
First, standing on deck
when that came through?

13:09.022 --> 13:10.555
I mean, I don't know
how close it was, but...

13:10.624 --> 13:12.624
That thing
was probably moving
couple hundred miles an hour

13:12.626 --> 13:14.058
When it goes past.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.630
Did you guys see that?

13:18.632 --> 13:21.900
[casey] dude. That was gnarly.
Look at how splintered
that thing is.

13:22.502 --> 13:23.802
What the hell happened?

13:23.804 --> 13:26.004
-[josh] it just snapped.
-[casey] holy [bleep].

13:26.940 --> 13:28.239
-[chuckles] damn it.
-[shane] oh, man.

13:28.241 --> 13:31.309
We can't be buying
these things
at garage sales anymore.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.678
-You guys are okay, though?
-[josh] everybody's all right.

13:33.680 --> 13:34.979
[jeff] yeah, we're good.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.447
-[josh] let's go in
and regroup, man.
-[jeff] okay.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.117
[casey] hey,
let's buy new this time, yeah?

13:40.053 --> 13:41.319
Just no more cheap stuff.

13:49.963 --> 13:52.030
[casey] we're done playing.
We're serious, dude.

13:52.032 --> 13:53.932
We'll spend the bucks
this time.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.034
[josh] <i> all right.</i>
<i> Well, here comes</i>
<i> a new stick right now.</i>

13:58.205 --> 14:01.306
And, uh, yeah, so we'll get
this one installed.

14:01.308 --> 14:03.007
Hopefully, this time... Yo.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.810
Yeah, roger.

14:05.812 --> 14:07.912
[casey] so, we burned
a day when we broke
our green stick.

14:09.316 --> 14:10.815
We bought it used.
Rookie mistake.

14:10.817 --> 14:13.051
One, two, three.

14:13.053 --> 14:16.621
<i> But we still think</i>
<i> it's gonna be the fastest wa</i>
<i> to get to 3,000 pounds.</i>

14:16.723 --> 14:19.824
Unfortunately, that means
we gotta drop 10k
on a new one.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.093
Okay, we got it?

14:22.095 --> 14:23.862
[jeff] <i> looks like</i>
<i> it's in a much better</i>
<i> condition than the first one</i>

14:25.732 --> 14:26.831
I think this one will last.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.135
[casey] let us pray. Right?

14:31.237 --> 14:32.569
Do we have to christen it?

14:32.571 --> 14:34.205
Do we have to bust a bottle
of champagne on it
or anything?

14:34.207 --> 14:35.807
[josh] let's just not try
to bust anything on it.

14:35.809 --> 14:38.943
-Champagne, sticks, poles...
-[casey cackling]

14:42.115 --> 14:43.848
All right, shane.
We should get
our boat ready to go.

14:43.917 --> 14:45.016
[shane] all right, let's go.

14:54.527 --> 14:55.760
[man] hey, what's up, bro?

14:56.930 --> 14:58.363
[casey] what's happening?

14:58.464 --> 15:00.765
I just want
to introduce myself.
I'm taylor.

15:00.833 --> 15:03.301
I own a local fish shop,
um, right down the street.

15:03.303 --> 15:06.938
And, um, I was just interested
if you guys had
any extra fish?

15:07.007 --> 15:08.806
-Yeah.
-[taylor] can you give me
a call and, uh--

15:08.808 --> 15:10.308
-[casey] yeah. Jeff,
come here.
-Awesome.

15:10.310 --> 15:11.609
Hey, nice
to meet you, bro.
How's it going?

15:11.611 --> 15:13.111
[jeff] good.
You own kauai poke?

15:13.113 --> 15:15.947
-[taylor] I do own
kauai poke, yeah.
-[jeff] awesome, bro.

15:16.049 --> 15:18.216
It's pretty common
for restaurant owners
to keep an eye out

15:18.218 --> 15:20.051
For new fishermen in the area.

15:20.120 --> 15:23.021
<i> They're always looking</i>
<i> for new product</i>
<i> for their menu.</i>

15:23.023 --> 15:25.490
Well, we're heading out
right now, so when we get
back, we'll hook you up.

15:25.492 --> 15:26.824
[taylor] yeah.
Nice to meet you guys.

15:26.826 --> 15:28.059
-Yeah, take care.
-[casey] take it easy.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.127
[taylor] yeah. <i> Aloha.</i>

15:33.033 --> 15:34.832
What was that all about?

15:34.901 --> 15:39.704
Um, that's, uh, taylor.
He owns poke, uh...
Kauai poke over here.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.438
It's kind of awesome,
you know?

15:41.440 --> 15:43.942
Get in with the local business
like that? They're all kind
of opening back up.

15:44.010 --> 15:46.844
Oh, dude. I mean,
we don't even have enough
to fill our order right now--

15:46.913 --> 15:48.212
Don't sweat it, bro.
Don't sweat it right now.

15:48.214 --> 15:49.681
We'll figure it out
when we get back.
All right?

15:49.683 --> 15:51.516
All right.

15:51.518 --> 15:54.852
<i> Right now, the fishing</i>
<i> here can't support</i>
<i> our mainland orders.</i>

15:54.921 --> 15:57.622
<i> And jeff's thinking about</i>
<i> taking on a new client?</i>

15:57.624 --> 15:59.757
<i> That's putting the cart</i>
<i> in front of the horse.</i>

15:59.859 --> 16:01.626
I mean, we just need
to focus on catching.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.963
Are you guys done?
Let's get out of here.

16:07.600 --> 16:08.665
[intense music playing]

16:15.208 --> 16:17.008
Right now, we're on our way
out to ni'ihau.

16:17.911 --> 16:19.110
We're gonna anchor
up there tonight,

16:19.112 --> 16:22.347
And then we're gonna go
fishing at ka'ula rock.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.816
That'll be tomorrow morning,
bright and early.

16:24.818 --> 16:26.550
[casey] <i> in order to catch</i>
<i> the weight we need,</i>

16:26.552 --> 16:29.854
We have to get the stick
up in a school. We can't just
run around in the blind.

16:30.790 --> 16:32.357
<i> In kona, we head for the buo</i>

16:32.425 --> 16:35.259
Or the structures
or the <i> ko'as,</i>  where we know
they like to feed.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.528
In kaua'I, there's no buoys.

16:38.431 --> 16:41.232
<i> But there is ka'ula rock.</i>

16:41.334 --> 16:44.135
[jeff] I've never
been this far up in
the northern islands, no way.

16:44.137 --> 16:46.104
-[kodi] you've never fished
out here?
-Never.

16:46.806 --> 16:48.038
Nobody does.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.942
Very, very, very few fishermen
venture this far north.

16:50.944 --> 16:53.611
It's the last resort,
we're pulling out
all the stops.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.747
[josh] <i> desperate times</i>
<i> calls for desperate measures</i>

16:57.817 --> 17:00.918
<i> Ka'ula rock</i>
<i> is at the far western edge</i>
<i> of the hawai'ian chain.</i>

17:01.755 --> 17:03.187
Going there is a gamble.

17:03.189 --> 17:06.024
<i> I mean, it's upstream</i>
<i> just to get there.</i>

17:06.026 --> 17:10.128
<i> But underwater structures</i>
<i> like it are fishermen's</i>
<i> secret weapon.</i>

17:10.130 --> 17:12.730
<i> On the bering sea,</i>
<i> my old man's go-to</i>
<i> was a rock pile.</i>

17:13.500 --> 17:15.733
[phil] I gotta park down on...

17:15.802 --> 17:18.102
[josh] everybody says
this is where
you made your name.

17:18.104 --> 17:19.404
It's where I made my name.

17:19.406 --> 17:20.505
This is your spot.

17:20.507 --> 17:23.508
Everyone says the rock
is your spot.

17:23.510 --> 17:26.344
[josh] <i> but the current inse</i>
<i> five mile underwater</i>
<i> mountain range,</i>

17:26.446 --> 17:27.612
<i> It causes upflowing.</i>

17:28.448 --> 17:30.114
<i> That means nutrients.</i>

17:30.116 --> 17:32.517
<i> Nutrients means bait,</i>
<i> and bait means crab.</i>

17:34.421 --> 17:37.088
<i> Ka'ula is the same concept,</i>
<i> but for tuna.</i>

17:37.090 --> 17:40.324
It's deep, it's steep
and it could be the jackpot
we're looking for.

17:48.301 --> 17:49.600
Okay, grab this
for a minute, josh.

17:49.602 --> 17:52.303
You can put that
right in that chest
all the way there.

17:52.305 --> 17:55.740
We're going over to ni'ihau,
trawling all the way,
hoping we get something.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.052
We're on. [bleep].

18:08.121 --> 18:09.220
We're on!

18:10.723 --> 18:11.756
Taut rod!

18:14.761 --> 18:15.827
<i> We got a fighter.</i>

18:16.663 --> 18:17.829
Let's get this thing in.

18:18.832 --> 18:21.499
Oh, wow. Look at the size
of that [bleep] thing.

18:23.503 --> 18:25.203
[kodi] oh, god,
what's going on? [screams]

18:25.205 --> 18:26.704
It's [bleep], slow down,
slow down, kodi.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.106
What the [bleep] is going on?

18:28.108 --> 18:29.207
It [bleep]...

18:29.209 --> 18:30.341
[all exclaim]

18:38.051 --> 18:39.951
That's an <i> ahi,</i>  brah.
We're on big fish.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.421
[kodi] oh, god,
what's going on? [screams]

18:43.423 --> 18:44.956
It's [bleep], slow down,
slow down, kodi.

18:44.958 --> 18:46.290
What the [bleep] is going on?

18:46.292 --> 18:48.826
-It [bleep]...
-[all exclaim]

18:49.729 --> 18:51.329
A bird nest down below, brah.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.300
[groans with disappointment]

19:04.110 --> 19:06.944
I was trying to hold the line
and stop it but...

19:08.715 --> 19:09.947
Couldn't do anything.

19:10.950 --> 19:13.618
We still have
over 2,900 pounds
to catch this week

19:13.620 --> 19:17.054
And we don't make it out
to ka'ula rock until
tomorrow morning.

19:17.123 --> 19:21.559
<i> Every</i>  ahi <i> that gets away p</i>
<i> that much more pressure</i>
<i> on ka'ula rock to produce.</i>

19:21.628 --> 19:23.728
I really just hope we're not
making another mistake.

19:26.065 --> 19:27.031
[kodi] that one hurts.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.101
That was a big <i> ahi.</i>

19:31.604 --> 19:33.905
It's heartbreaking
to lose any fish.

19:33.907 --> 19:36.207
I mean, we're almost
half way to ni'ihau...

19:36.209 --> 19:37.508
-Yeah.
-So, you know what?

19:37.510 --> 19:38.809
Don't even worry about this.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.044
This is just a little mishap.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.925
We should follow kodi.

19:53.927 --> 19:56.260
Try to find a bay
that's out of this wind.

19:56.329 --> 19:59.230
Get some rest,
we got a long day
of fishing tomorrow.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.132
Sounds good, man.

20:03.303 --> 20:06.504
We just threw our anchor,
gonna spend a couple
hours here,

20:06.506 --> 20:07.805
Do sunset,
get something to eat.

20:09.509 --> 20:12.043
I had it tied, that way we can
kinda sleep together.

20:12.045 --> 20:13.811
Ahoy there, matey!

20:13.813 --> 20:15.746
Gentlemen, you ready
for some boat camping?

20:15.815 --> 20:17.648
Who brought the marshmallows?

20:17.717 --> 20:19.250
Nobody brought
marshmallows, dude.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.252
No, no. Not that type
of camping, pal.

20:21.721 --> 20:22.987
[laughs]

20:24.190 --> 20:26.324
<i> Shane and I haven't been</i>
<i> around each other in years</i>

20:27.327 --> 20:28.960
But having my brother
fishing with me again

20:29.829 --> 20:31.862
Just... Feels right.

20:31.964 --> 20:34.599
[shane] josh!
You're my brother and
you're watching this [bleep]!

20:34.601 --> 20:36.500
Pick and choose your battles.

20:36.502 --> 20:39.003
And right now, I think I'd be
on the losing end.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.571
[all laughing]

20:40.573 --> 20:43.207
The four years I got to spend
with jake and my dad
on the cornelia

20:43.209 --> 20:45.009
Were some of the best years
of my life.

20:45.011 --> 20:47.211
-You would be...
-Hey!

20:47.213 --> 20:49.113
Oh, I'm shaking in my boots.

20:52.518 --> 20:54.252
<i> Shane and I missed out</i>
<i> on a lot.</i>

20:55.655 --> 20:57.054
<i> It's nice to get</i>
<i> a second chance here.</i>

21:00.593 --> 21:03.327
-Should be all right, huh?
-All right, guys. Let's eat.

21:27.320 --> 21:30.254
<i> I'm just kinda starting off</i>
<i> this morning waiting</i>
<i> for the big guys.</i>

21:30.323 --> 21:32.256
Find that pile
of the big fish.

21:33.693 --> 21:36.460
I got a feeling
this thing's gonna light up
like a christmas tree.

21:38.398 --> 21:39.764
[kodi] depending on
how good the bite is.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.234
We could fill this boat
really quick.

21:43.336 --> 21:46.404
But if they're not here,
we may have come all the way
out here for nothing.

21:48.107 --> 21:49.607
[josh] <i> it's been</i>
<i> a 24-hour trip here</i>

21:49.609 --> 21:51.108
<i> And it'll be another day</i>
<i> to get back.</i>

21:52.312 --> 21:54.645
<i> Ka'ula rock,</i>
<i> it better produce.</i>

21:54.714 --> 21:57.114
<i> We need a couple thousand</i>
<i> pounds minimum.</i>

21:57.116 --> 21:59.650
If we don't get that,
we'll have to have
some tough conversations

21:59.752 --> 22:00.951
About fishing
outside of hawai'I,

22:01.621 --> 22:02.853
<i> And nobody wants that.</i>

22:05.525 --> 22:07.091
You know, it's a good thing
we're doing this

22:07.093 --> 22:10.161
Because I can stay here
and work, kodi can drive,
'cause it's rough,

22:10.229 --> 22:11.662
I can work the hydraulics,

22:11.764 --> 22:13.564
You're hooking the fish, man,
you know?

22:13.632 --> 22:15.232
We got four baits on here,

22:15.301 --> 22:18.302
So remember that
the longest leader
is the closest one to us.

22:18.304 --> 22:20.104
So when you grab that leader,

22:20.106 --> 22:23.307
-Don't stop until
that fish is up top.
-Okay.

22:24.444 --> 22:25.843
[jeff] we're testing this out.

22:26.813 --> 22:28.312
Gonna learn the angle
to dangle.

22:31.317 --> 22:33.417
-[boat rocks]
-oh, dangle! He's on!

22:33.419 --> 22:35.052
-They're on.
-Yeah, we're on.

22:36.322 --> 22:37.421
Holy moly.

22:37.423 --> 22:39.824
There we go. All right,
let's bring that one in.

22:42.562 --> 22:44.328
Looks like they already
hooked up.

22:44.330 --> 22:45.730
-Who's reeling that in?
-I don't know.

22:47.166 --> 22:48.432
They're hooked in
to something.

22:52.905 --> 22:53.938
[jeff] looks like a nice fish.

22:54.907 --> 22:56.107
It's underneath you right now!

22:56.709 --> 22:57.508
It's underneath us!

23:00.012 --> 23:01.045
Pull him out.

23:02.315 --> 23:04.248
-Pull him, pull him.
-That is a good size.

23:04.350 --> 23:05.750
-Yeah, man, you good.
-Nah.

23:05.851 --> 23:06.717
Got it?

23:11.824 --> 23:13.424
[kodi] excellent.

23:13.426 --> 23:14.825
Probably a 50-pounder, buddy.

23:14.827 --> 23:17.128
[jeff] yeah! Dude, all right!

23:17.130 --> 23:19.830
That size right there,
that's how you fill the boat.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.733
First fish on the stick.

23:22.735 --> 23:26.303
Hey, I don't know how
the other boys are doing
but we're doing okay.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.510
Boys over there
got one above 40.

23:33.179 --> 23:35.312
The other boat got a 40, so...

23:35.314 --> 23:37.314
We wanna at least
get bigger than that, too.

23:38.117 --> 23:39.216
We got goals.

23:39.285 --> 23:41.619
-Why do we need to do that?
-Just 'cause... Josh.

23:41.621 --> 23:43.254
Yeah. Okay, good.
I like your attitude.

23:43.355 --> 23:45.956
[all laughing]

23:46.025 --> 23:47.958
[casey] josh and jeff,
we gotta beat 'em
no matter what.

23:48.027 --> 23:49.326
No matter what!

23:54.934 --> 23:57.535
-[casey] oh, we got one!
-Oh, that was a hit.

23:57.636 --> 23:58.936
Yeah, right here, right here!

23:58.938 --> 24:00.204
-[casey] we're on.
-All right.

24:00.206 --> 24:02.640
[alapai] you guys
have gotta do it,
I gotta drive.

24:02.708 --> 24:04.842
There it is, double, double,
double, double!

24:06.312 --> 24:08.245
-Where's the third one?
-Four!

24:08.314 --> 24:10.948
-Three, three!
-It's three! Come on,
number four!

24:11.951 --> 24:13.117
Fighting a triple.

24:18.724 --> 24:20.925
Alapai's guys
are fighting a triple.

24:20.927 --> 24:22.960
-What?
-Alapai's guys
have got a triple.

24:22.962 --> 24:23.861
-No way!
-Yeah.

24:31.204 --> 24:32.669
Okay, stop.

24:35.441 --> 24:38.075
-This one, right?
-Yeah, crank it. The one
that has the fish on it.

24:38.077 --> 24:39.710
[casey grunts]

24:41.747 --> 24:43.814
All right, just gotta check
the hooks real quick
on this one.

24:49.121 --> 24:50.421
Another nice one.

24:50.823 --> 24:51.722
Now crank 'em.

25:00.132 --> 25:02.399
Another nice yellowfin.

25:02.401 --> 25:05.402
[alapai] we got a triple
right here, so good start
to the morning.

25:05.404 --> 25:06.570
Hopefully they keep biting,

25:06.572 --> 25:08.706
I mean, we're hoping to see
a little bit bigger ones

25:08.708 --> 25:11.575
But kinda gotta take
what's available, y'know?

25:11.577 --> 25:13.310
-Ten, look at that. Nice one.
-Yeah, good!

25:13.312 --> 25:15.045
-Nice one.
-Yeah.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.217
[alapai] <i> birds all over.</i>

25:20.219 --> 25:21.851
Looks phenomenal for fishing,

25:21.853 --> 25:24.221
<i> We just need a bigger one</i>
<i> to start coming around</i>
<i> and just bite.</i>

25:30.563 --> 25:32.196
-Oh, right there!
-[all exclaim]

25:32.198 --> 25:34.365
-That was a good bite.
-[casey] oh, yeah, it's on.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.033
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, yeah!

25:36.135 --> 25:37.735
[whooping] look at that!

25:39.038 --> 25:40.237
-Oh!
-Yeah!

25:40.306 --> 25:41.271
There we go.

25:41.273 --> 25:42.439
-That's what we want.
-Look at that!

25:44.844 --> 25:46.410
<i> -Fifty pounder.</i>
-[kodi] <i> that's a nice fish.</i>

25:46.412 --> 25:48.145
[josh] that is,
that's beautiful.

25:48.213 --> 25:50.114
[jeff] this is the size
of the fish that
we're going for.

25:51.417 --> 25:52.917
All right, josh, get ready.
Here it comes.

26:04.463 --> 26:05.829
-Oh!
-Yeah!

26:05.831 --> 26:06.796
There we go!

26:06.798 --> 26:08.032
-That's what we want.
-Look at that!

26:10.536 --> 26:12.703
-[josh] <i> fifty pounder.</i>
<i> -That's a nice fish.</i>

26:12.705 --> 26:15.339
[jeff] this is the size
of the fish that
we're going for.

26:15.441 --> 26:16.907
All right, josh, get ready,
here it comes!

26:19.512 --> 26:21.078
-Whoa, there it is!
-There it is, there it is.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.112
Yeah, we're on.

26:23.015 --> 26:24.348
We just snapped a double <i> ahi</i>

26:24.917 --> 26:26.650
All right! All right.

26:28.054 --> 26:29.219
Keep that line coming in.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.156
Looks like we had
a nice one on there.

26:32.825 --> 26:33.857
Oh, oh, oh!

26:34.427 --> 26:35.426
Now, boys!

26:36.529 --> 26:38.662
-We just got a triple.
-Damn.

26:41.300 --> 26:42.933
You got him, josh.
Come on, josh!

26:43.035 --> 26:44.702
Josh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:46.839 --> 26:48.038
Let me go, let me go.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.340
We pull him over.

26:49.441 --> 26:50.608
[bleep]

26:50.610 --> 26:52.209
<i> -Yeah, dude.</i>
<i> -Yeah!</i>

26:54.213 --> 26:56.513
Right there, right there,
right there, in the boat.

26:57.617 --> 26:59.216
-Yes!
-That's the ones
we're looking for.

27:02.755 --> 27:04.321
-Oh.
-Wow, man.

27:07.460 --> 27:08.492
Nice.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.963
Hey, all right!
Getting a little bigger.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.231
Nice one, nice one.

27:14.900 --> 27:16.433
That's a beautiful thing.

27:19.639 --> 27:21.405
[josh] the weather's
come up quite a bit.

27:21.407 --> 27:24.008
It's roping out here,
it's blowing over 30.

27:24.010 --> 27:25.743
It's rough, super rough.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.344
Everybody's gotta be
on their game.

27:36.522 --> 27:37.521
Oh, there it goes.

27:37.523 --> 27:39.156
[everyone] we're on, we're on!

27:39.258 --> 27:40.524
I just got a double
right here.

27:40.526 --> 27:41.925
-Double! Triple!
-Triple.

27:43.329 --> 27:44.428
Come on, guys!

27:45.131 --> 27:48.599
Yeah, four!

27:48.601 --> 27:50.601
-[all laughing]
-is that everything?
That's everything.

27:52.238 --> 27:53.937
The green sticks
are running perfect.

27:54.039 --> 27:56.306
And casey and shane,
they're on fire.

27:57.710 --> 28:00.310
<i> We're on our way to hit</i>
<i> this 3,000 pound mark.</i>

28:00.746 --> 28:01.912
Oh, [bleep]

28:01.914 --> 28:03.514
[alapai] that's what
we're talking about, boys!

28:03.516 --> 28:04.848
[casey] yeah, we got a fourth!

28:04.917 --> 28:05.816
[laughs]

28:05.818 --> 28:07.351
We're asking this all day.

28:11.457 --> 28:13.323
You cranking it
right up here? Good.

28:18.230 --> 28:19.763
Holy [bleep].

28:19.832 --> 28:20.764
Boy, we are in 'em.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.232
[alapai] nice.

28:22.234 --> 28:24.101
Yeah, we're definitely
wrapped up on these two.

28:24.103 --> 28:26.336
You got this one? Good.

28:26.405 --> 28:28.305
-Pull this one.
-Is that mine or yours?

28:28.307 --> 28:30.507
-Oh, [bleep].
-They're tied together,
they're hooked together.

28:30.509 --> 28:32.209
Or it's one fish
and two hooks, I don't know.

28:34.714 --> 28:37.114
-Oh, my god.
-Shane, you up
on the other one.

28:37.116 --> 28:39.316
Yes, sir. Watch your leg.

28:41.053 --> 28:43.053
It's got more fight
than most of 'em.

28:43.155 --> 28:44.154
You gotta respect him.

28:45.424 --> 28:46.623
He's going for its bro.

28:48.094 --> 28:49.626
That's a damn nice fish.

28:53.799 --> 28:55.799
He fought a lot harder
than the other ones.

28:55.801 --> 28:58.502
If you don't have 'em
in the mouth, they can fight
easier with their head.

28:59.505 --> 29:00.938
Okay, went in a little.

29:05.411 --> 29:06.910
No?

29:07.713 --> 29:09.046
Those are nice fish.

29:12.051 --> 29:13.951
Oh, it bit on this thing,
and it's still...

29:18.924 --> 29:19.957
Good.

29:20.826 --> 29:22.059
We just got four fish,

29:22.061 --> 29:23.327
We gotta get our lines
right back out,

29:23.329 --> 29:24.561
Try to get some more.

29:24.563 --> 29:26.864
Get 'em while the bite's on
and we can make mo' money.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.032
We gotta make
that money, honey.

29:29.802 --> 29:31.001
Gotta make that money.

29:31.537 --> 29:33.437
That was a hot spot,

29:33.506 --> 29:36.440
So we're gonna see
if we can do that again.

29:36.542 --> 29:38.509
[casey] <i> we're doing good.</i>
<i> We're filling up</i>
<i> the boxes out here.</i>

29:38.511 --> 29:41.011
Between the two boats,
we probably only have
to catch another...

29:41.013 --> 29:43.614
200-250 pounds
to get to 3,000.

29:43.616 --> 29:45.282
But the weather's getting
worse by the minute

29:45.284 --> 29:46.617
And we're running out of time.

29:53.826 --> 29:57.227
Yeah, you can see these waves,
they're just so rocky.

29:57.229 --> 29:59.630
You can't even walk a foot
without falling over.

30:00.633 --> 30:02.399
I would hate to do this
and not catch fish.

30:07.106 --> 30:09.606
We are getting fish,
we're just not getting
the sizes in.

30:09.608 --> 30:11.108
We don't have the time
to sit out here.

30:11.110 --> 30:12.375
I have a strong feeling

30:12.377 --> 30:14.244
We're gonna get chased off
by the weather here real soon.

30:14.346 --> 30:16.113
This is, kinda borderline...

30:16.115 --> 30:17.514
-[kodi] we're on!
-We're on.

30:19.819 --> 30:21.218
-[josh] good-sized one,
it looks like.
-Yeah.

30:22.321 --> 30:23.954
It's gonna pull over
a ten-pounder.

30:24.723 --> 30:26.423
-Josh, you can fight this.
-Okay.

30:31.197 --> 30:33.363
[josh] oh, hurrah.

30:33.432 --> 30:37.000
[jeff] you got bit.
Right, we gotta get it,
it's blowing out here.

30:37.002 --> 30:38.802
It's blowing over 35, easy.

30:43.409 --> 30:45.409
That's a nice one.
That's a good one, man.

30:46.212 --> 30:47.845
Yeah, nice!

30:47.946 --> 30:50.447
That's like, a 20-pounder,
we'll take those all day.
Nice.

30:50.516 --> 30:51.415
[josh] yeah, not bad.

30:52.251 --> 30:53.116
Boom.

30:53.853 --> 30:55.018
That was all you.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.720
You're a natural at this,
man, for real.

30:58.824 --> 31:00.090
[josh] let's go check
on casey.

31:05.965 --> 31:07.664
How'd it go?

31:07.733 --> 31:11.001
It's going good, bros,
we got, like,
20-24 pieces maybe.

31:11.003 --> 31:13.437
I don't know,
something like that. One <i> ono</i>

31:13.505 --> 31:15.505
How'd you guys do?
What'd you end up with?

31:15.507 --> 31:17.341
Oh, we did pretty good.

31:17.442 --> 31:20.344
But there's a reason why
there's nobody else out here.

31:20.412 --> 31:22.045
It's blowing from
two different directions,

31:22.047 --> 31:24.047
We got a cross-current.

31:24.116 --> 31:26.216
Well, let's call it.
Head back for home base, huh?

31:26.218 --> 31:27.951
Yeah, let's just get
this going.

31:28.020 --> 31:29.720
-All right man,
we'll see you guys inside.
-[all clap]

31:30.623 --> 31:32.222
[josh] <i> we're really close</i>
<i> to our number,</i>

31:32.224 --> 31:34.157
But we just cannot
come up light again.

31:34.259 --> 31:37.327
I'd feel a lot better
if we had
a little bit more weight.

31:37.329 --> 31:39.630
<i> I'm a fisherman,</i>
<i> I always want more weight.</i>

31:43.102 --> 31:45.135
It's wonderful being out here
with my brother, you know.

31:45.137 --> 31:47.638
I'm spending a lot of time
with my brother casey now.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.806
[all laughing]

31:49.808 --> 31:52.309
We gonna start trawling back,
we got a long ways to go.

31:52.311 --> 31:54.544
All right, you wanna get
the deep water lures out?

31:54.613 --> 31:56.346
Yeah, we'll start fishing
our way back.

31:56.448 --> 31:57.247
Okay.

32:06.625 --> 32:08.825
-[exclaims]
-yeah!

32:09.662 --> 32:11.828
Yeah! Gonna be
a good one, boys!

32:12.531 --> 32:13.664
We're on, we're on.

32:13.732 --> 32:15.198
[alapai] get those things up
and round them up.

32:15.200 --> 32:17.801
Hand them of...
We want this clear,
it's gonna be a big fish.

32:17.803 --> 32:19.303
Get the lines...!

32:19.305 --> 32:20.704
Big <i> ahi,</i>  big <i> ah</i>

32:24.310 --> 32:26.209
They're fighting a fish,
it's super rough,

32:26.211 --> 32:28.612
So we're just trying
to stay close to them.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.814
My brother might be reeling
his first big fish.

32:32.818 --> 32:35.118
Clear the line, clear the line
as quickly as you can, boys.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.954
Big fish.

32:37.022 --> 32:39.222
This is the one
we came out for, guys!

32:39.224 --> 32:40.423
Yeah, it's a big guy.

32:46.332 --> 32:47.831
[josh] <i> this might be</i>
<i> shane's first big fish.</i>

32:48.634 --> 32:49.800
We'll see.

32:50.836 --> 32:52.035
That'd be great for him.

32:52.037 --> 32:53.704
And great for the business.

32:53.706 --> 32:56.406
My first big fish
weighed, like, 160.

32:56.408 --> 32:58.342
-[exclaims nervously]
-it's okay, it's okay.

32:59.511 --> 33:00.610
And switch.

33:00.612 --> 33:02.512
Yeah but you had help
on that one.

33:04.116 --> 33:05.248
It's... Right here.

33:05.250 --> 33:07.250
-[alapai] go on, get him!
-[shane] all right, fish!

33:07.352 --> 33:09.152
-Got him.
-Yeah, yeah, right now.

33:09.221 --> 33:11.955
And that <i> ahi</i>
was not 160 pounds.

33:12.791 --> 33:15.559
This fish probably weighs
about 130.

33:15.660 --> 33:17.961
I don't know,
it was a sea monster,
it wasn't a fish.

33:17.963 --> 33:19.262
-Are you sure?
-Whatever.

33:19.364 --> 33:20.931
[jeff] <i> shane's pulling</i>
<i> his weight so far.</i>

33:20.933 --> 33:22.199
<i> He's doing good.</i>

33:22.201 --> 33:25.002
I'm happy that
he decided to come out.
He needed that.

33:25.004 --> 33:28.505
What if your brother's fish
is bigger than yours?

33:28.507 --> 33:30.507
Dude, it's all
in the family, man.

33:30.509 --> 33:31.408
It's all in the family.

33:33.345 --> 33:34.911
Just... You know what I mean.

33:43.756 --> 33:46.089
[alapai] clear the line,
clear the line
as quickly as you can, boys.

33:46.091 --> 33:47.958
Big fish.

33:48.027 --> 33:49.826
This is the one
we came out for, guys!

33:49.828 --> 33:51.428
Yep, this is the guy!

33:55.034 --> 33:57.034
[casey] that's a heavy,
heavy fish.

33:57.102 --> 33:59.269
[alapai] take your time,
brother, he's gonna take
a little while.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.810
Casey, we're gonna take
the fish on this side.

34:06.812 --> 34:07.944
[casey] okay.

34:12.818 --> 34:15.452
When it took the line,
when this thing hit it,

34:15.487 --> 34:17.320
It ripped so damn fast.

34:17.322 --> 34:19.489
I mean, it just peeled
the line off that reel.

34:19.491 --> 34:21.425
No little fish could peel
that much line.

34:21.427 --> 34:23.059
With the way we had
the drag set,

34:23.061 --> 34:25.962
That thing would have been
sitting there, bouncing
along the surface by now.

34:25.964 --> 34:27.197
This is a big fish.

34:27.199 --> 34:28.832
This has gotta be
a hundred-plus, easy.

34:32.504 --> 34:34.805
It might break the surface
here pretty quick.

34:34.807 --> 34:37.941
He's getting close, I can feel
more drag tension now.

34:38.043 --> 34:40.110
And he don't like the idea
of being close to a boat,

34:40.112 --> 34:41.411
I can already feel him
pulling harder.

34:41.413 --> 34:42.612
Really, really harder.

34:43.649 --> 34:45.348
Easy does it, easy does it.

34:46.118 --> 34:47.116
[sighs]

34:47.186 --> 34:49.252
[bleep], he is a really
heavy fish, dude.

34:52.324 --> 34:54.724
Casey's on a leader,
I hope that these guys
get their fish.

34:56.962 --> 34:58.562
[casey] I got a caller,
caller, yeah!

34:58.630 --> 34:59.763
New caller, coming up.

35:00.766 --> 35:02.132
He's pulling back harder.

35:03.035 --> 35:04.501
A lot that could
go wrong right now.

35:05.938 --> 35:07.637
Here's your big...
There you go, there you go.

35:16.915 --> 35:18.115
If he goes under,
lean in to him.

35:19.218 --> 35:21.051
Doing good,
doing good, brother.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.319
Bring it to me,
bring it to me.

35:24.923 --> 35:27.457
Got him!
...Coming at you, stand by!

35:28.360 --> 35:29.459
There we go, straight.

35:31.563 --> 35:32.629
Yeah!

35:34.366 --> 35:38.034
All right, brother. On three.
One, two, three.

35:38.036 --> 35:38.835
[straining] go.

35:39.938 --> 35:40.904
[grunts]

35:40.906 --> 35:42.139
Woo!

35:43.142 --> 35:44.141
[whooping triumphantly]

35:44.242 --> 35:45.108
[alapai] yeah, boys!

35:45.110 --> 35:46.343
-Yeah, baby!
-Come on!

35:47.412 --> 35:49.146
Good job, boys. Good job.

35:49.214 --> 35:50.947
-Oh, buddy.
-Nice job.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.383
-Yeah!
-Nice job.

35:53.385 --> 35:56.453
-Yeah. Beauty, beauty!
-Beautiful fish.

35:56.522 --> 35:57.687
-Whoo!
-Hell, yeah!

35:57.689 --> 36:00.524
-Yeah!
-I'm thinking 150. 160?

36:02.261 --> 36:04.528
[jeff] yeah!
He got him, all right!

36:04.530 --> 36:05.462
Solid.

36:05.530 --> 36:07.531
Yeah, he got it on board.

36:07.533 --> 36:09.966
-Nice work, boys.
-[jeff] good going, boys!

36:09.968 --> 36:12.335
Casey and shane
are doing really good
as a team.

36:12.404 --> 36:13.803
They came to play for sure.

36:16.942 --> 36:18.542
[shane] ready?
One, two, three.

36:19.044 --> 36:20.243
There you go, okay.

36:20.946 --> 36:22.279
[shouts]

36:22.281 --> 36:24.648
That was a tough fish
to fight, shane did
a hell of a job.

36:25.417 --> 36:26.750
Trying to make josh proud.

36:26.752 --> 36:29.319
I hope he's gonna
enjoy this box
that's gathered here.

36:33.325 --> 36:35.225
The baby bird's been kicked
out of the nest

36:35.227 --> 36:37.027
And she's starting
to glide a little bit.

36:37.863 --> 36:38.828
A little bit.

36:40.265 --> 36:42.132
Ka'ula rock, man. [shouts]

36:50.209 --> 36:51.841
All right, so how much fish
do we have?

36:52.544 --> 36:53.944
Well, it sounds like...

36:54.813 --> 36:56.346
I know we filled
one of our boxes

36:56.448 --> 36:58.748
And we went into our overflow,
so we got a decent amount.

36:58.850 --> 36:59.849
How 'bout you guys?

36:59.851 --> 37:02.219
We did one box plus, like,
75% of the extra.

37:02.221 --> 37:04.521
[josh] how much fish
is that total, you think?

37:04.523 --> 37:06.056
I don't know what
the exact weight is,

37:06.058 --> 37:07.724
But we're taking
30 pounds out of it,

37:07.726 --> 37:09.926
And we're gonna give it
to taylor at kauai poke.

37:09.928 --> 37:12.162
[josh] dude, we haven't
even filled a barrel yet.

37:12.231 --> 37:15.198
I mean, why the hell
are we taking more orders

37:15.200 --> 37:17.734
When we haven't even
filled the one order
that we've gotta fill.

37:17.803 --> 37:19.703
It's about accounts, okay?

37:19.705 --> 37:21.238
We have to secure
more accounts.

37:21.306 --> 37:23.306
If you're not growing,
in business, you're dying.

37:23.842 --> 37:25.008
You have to expand.

37:29.114 --> 37:30.747
I mean, I understand
where you're at,

37:30.749 --> 37:34.251
But I'm gonna service hawai'I
just as much as I'm gonna
service other places.

37:34.352 --> 37:36.186
Let's just get home.
Let's just get home.

37:36.188 --> 37:37.420
[casey] whatever you
wanna do, man.

37:40.626 --> 37:42.225
[josh] <i> ka'ula rock</i>
<i> was a success.</i>

37:43.328 --> 37:44.961
But the travel up there
and back killed us,

37:46.531 --> 37:47.464
<i> So we're a day late.</i>

37:49.701 --> 37:50.800
<i> It just makes it too risky</i>

37:50.802 --> 37:52.402
<i> For it to be</i>
<i> our long-term solution.</i>

37:53.205 --> 37:54.804
So, we're back to square one.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.840
We still don't have
a location on a chain

37:56.842 --> 37:58.141
That's gonna keep up
with our demand.

38:02.247 --> 38:05.548
I hate to say it but I think
we need to take a look...

38:07.119 --> 38:10.520
We're just not getting
the type of quantity
that we need.

38:10.522 --> 38:13.023
My dad's notebooks
had a lot of names
and a lot of places in them.

38:14.726 --> 38:18.228
Two years ago,
my grandpa's trailer
in north dakota.

38:18.230 --> 38:20.363
<i> I found a treasure trove</i>
<i> of my dad's writings.</i>

38:20.432 --> 38:22.799
<i> Fishing spots</i>
<i> from around the world.</i>

38:22.801 --> 38:23.800
[casey] look at that.

38:27.606 --> 38:30.707
"ports. West port,
new zealand. Baja..."

38:31.610 --> 38:34.911
"hnl to nova scotia."

38:34.913 --> 38:37.647
I always thought he had
something bigger in mind
than just hawai'I.

38:38.517 --> 38:39.949
Maybe now's the time
to find out.

38:40.952 --> 38:42.552
[jeff] I respect everything
that's written

38:42.654 --> 38:44.854
That your father's left behind
for you guys,

38:44.956 --> 38:47.324
But one of the reasons
that we've been so successful

38:47.326 --> 38:50.527
Out here in hawai'I
is the network.

38:50.529 --> 38:52.629
I mean, I don't think
we should forget
where we came from.

38:52.631 --> 38:54.431
This whole thing
started in hawai'I,

38:54.433 --> 38:56.599
If we get over
the fronts of our skis...

38:56.601 --> 38:57.534
We're gonna have an issue.

38:58.136 --> 38:59.302
So what's your plan?

39:00.339 --> 39:01.604
I think it's time
to pack it up.

39:02.240 --> 39:03.573
Let's head back to kona.

39:03.575 --> 39:05.508
There's a really good chance
that while we were travelling

39:05.510 --> 39:06.810
The fish were travelling, too.

39:06.812 --> 39:08.945
They could be right back
in kona waiting for us.

39:08.947 --> 39:11.247
And we'll be out in the water
tomorrow at day break.

39:14.720 --> 39:18.288
I've got an idea of something
that we can try in kona.

39:18.290 --> 39:19.922
Let's give it a shot,
one more time.

39:21.226 --> 39:24.961
And then from there,
if you're still not satisfied
and you wanna leave,

39:25.030 --> 39:27.630
I respect your decision.

39:27.632 --> 39:30.934
[josh] <i> hawai'I,</i>
<i> this fishing community</i>
<i> means everything to jeff.</i>

39:31.002 --> 39:33.403
<i> I totally get that,</i>
<i> means a lot to me, too.</i>

39:33.405 --> 39:36.239
But we didn't start
this business just to be
a local provider.

39:37.409 --> 39:38.641
So man, what are you thinking?

39:38.743 --> 39:41.711
Well, I came out
to help you and...

39:41.713 --> 39:43.713
It seems like the business
needs some sort of change.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.215
So we need to do something.

39:49.154 --> 39:51.388
So we go back to kona,

39:51.390 --> 39:52.855
We'll see what
we come up with.

39:52.857 --> 39:55.291
But I don't wanna let
the lower 48 accounts
just slip away.

39:55.293 --> 39:56.960
Let's just give it
one more shot in kona.

39:58.063 --> 39:59.329
Right, we'll see what you got.

40:01.700 --> 40:03.700
<i> We're heading back</i>
<i> to the big island.</i>

40:03.702 --> 40:06.870
<i> Sounds like jeff's</i>
<i> got something up his sleeve</i>

40:06.872 --> 40:09.939
<i> But my old man</i>
<i> always told me to go</i>
<i> where the fish are biting</i>

40:09.941 --> 40:11.641
<i> And I can't help</i>
<i> but think, right now,</i>

40:11.710 --> 40:13.710
<i> That means some other place</i>
<i> where my dad fished.</i>

40:15.547 --> 40:17.414
<i> The more my brother and I</i>
<i> work together,</i>

40:17.416 --> 40:20.517
The more I realize that
even though jeff and casey
are like family,

40:22.020 --> 40:24.220
<i> They may not understand</i>
<i> the drive that I have</i>

40:24.322 --> 40:25.822
<i> To follow the old man's</i>
<i> footsteps.</i>

40:25.824 --> 40:27.624
-I think that was you.
-Next time.

40:27.626 --> 40:29.559
-Appreciate it.
-You guys have a good one.

40:29.628 --> 40:30.727
-You, too.
-All right.

40:30.729 --> 40:32.962
[casey] kona bound.
He's gonna love it, man.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.530
-Good move, bro.
-Boo!

40:37.402 --> 40:40.003
[josh] <i> maybe the only way</i>
<i> I can assure</i>
<i> the family business</i>

40:40.005 --> 40:41.404
<i> Is with the help of a guy</i>

40:41.406 --> 40:43.239
<i> That knew my dad</i>
<i> just as well as I did.</i>

40:44.910 --> 40:46.810
<i> Hopefully, that harris luck</i>
<i> will get doubled.</i>

40:48.814 --> 40:50.814
Now that there's two of us
on the job.

40:58.056 --> 40:59.522
I'm running this whole place
over here

40:59.524 --> 41:01.024
And I'm depending on you guys.

41:01.026 --> 41:02.225
Hey, barry, stop.

41:03.061 --> 41:04.127
We're on.

41:04.129 --> 41:06.062
-Still there?
-I don't think so.

41:06.164 --> 41:07.530
<i> You've got a shark, bro.</i>

41:11.503 --> 41:12.902
[casey] gotta keep 'em
tight, dude.
