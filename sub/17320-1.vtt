00:24.524 --> 00:26.924
It must be terribly sinful.

00:26.960 --> 00:28.325
What?

00:28.361 --> 00:31.262
Well, vanity is a sin,
isn't it, Ann?

00:31.297 --> 00:34.494
Well, if that's the only one,
you'll do.

00:34.534 --> 00:35.501
There.

00:35.535 --> 00:36.763
Where are you going now?

00:36.803 --> 00:38.327
I'm going to get some flowers

00:38.371 --> 00:40.965
to braid in your hair.

01:04.631 --> 01:05.893
That was quick, Ann.

01:05.932 --> 01:07.024
Did you fi...?

01:53.113 --> 01:54.341
Ann?

01:56.549 --> 01:58.449
Ann!

02:11.831 --> 02:13.958
Ann?

06:10.669 --> 06:13.502
And what crime
have you committed?

06:13.539 --> 06:16.167
I danced on a Sunday.

06:53.178 --> 06:54.736
We're heading east.

06:54.780 --> 06:56.247
That'll do.

06:56.282 --> 06:57.340
Get on the wagon.

07:25.244 --> 07:26.711
Happy birthday.

07:26.745 --> 07:28.610
God bless you, my child.

07:28.647 --> 07:31.377
And this to make it
a happier birthday.

07:37.323 --> 07:38.950
It belonged to your dear mother.

07:39.024 --> 07:40.514
It was her last wish
that you should have it.

07:40.559 --> 07:43.187
Happy birthday, dearest sister.

07:43.228 --> 07:46.288
It's wonderful...

07:46.332 --> 07:48.459
but I daren't wear it.

07:48.500 --> 07:49.831
What if I were to lose it?

07:49.868 --> 07:50.857
No fear of that.

07:50.903 --> 07:54.134
That lock's as tight and cunning
as a money lender.

07:54.173 --> 07:56.164
May I go and show it to Petra?

07:56.208 --> 07:57.266
May I, Papa?

07:57.309 --> 07:58.298
Of course.

07:58.344 --> 08:00.778
She'll be so envious.

08:00.813 --> 08:02.075
Mind you, get back

08:02.114 --> 08:04.105
before dark, now.

09:44.149 --> 09:45.776
What's your name, girl?

09:45.818 --> 09:48.286
Carla.

09:48.320 --> 09:49.947
I'm Grost...

09:49.988 --> 09:52.286
Professor Hieronymos Grost.

09:52.324 --> 09:53.621
Professor?

09:53.659 --> 09:55.251
I profess to be.

09:58.664 --> 10:00.461
What about him?

10:00.499 --> 10:02.467
What's the "K" stand for?

10:02.501 --> 10:03.968
Is he a king or something?

10:04.036 --> 10:05.765
A king?

10:09.675 --> 10:12.439
Yes, in a way, I suppose he is.

10:12.478 --> 10:15.276
But the "K" stands for Kronos...

10:15.314 --> 10:16.645
Captain Kronos,

10:16.682 --> 10:18.309
late of the lmperial Guard.

10:18.350 --> 10:19.840
Well, if he's not a king,

10:19.885 --> 10:21.853
why does he leave us
to do all the work?

10:21.887 --> 10:23.479
He has to conserve his strength.

10:23.522 --> 10:26.821
We've ridden far,
and tomorrow we will be...

10:26.859 --> 10:28.827
where we must be.

10:28.861 --> 10:31.489
And that's when his work
will begin again.

10:31.530 --> 10:33.327
Work? What-what work?

10:33.365 --> 10:36.027
I'm turning in, Grost.

10:47.846 --> 10:49.780
Where do I sleep?

10:49.815 --> 10:53.751
We've only blankets
enough for two.

10:53.785 --> 10:55.218
Suit yourself.

11:01.660 --> 11:02.991
Good night.

11:26.818 --> 11:29.048
Isabella?

11:30.222 --> 11:32.122
Isabella?

11:38.297 --> 11:39.594
Isabella?

11:51.810 --> 11:52.970
Isabella?!

12:35.153 --> 12:36.780
Marcus?

12:36.822 --> 12:38.483
Aye.

12:38.523 --> 12:40.423
Dr. Marcus lives here.

12:41.660 --> 12:44.823
Who wants him?

12:44.863 --> 12:46.228
Marcus!

13:12.356 --> 13:13.687
Kronos.

13:20.565 --> 13:21.930
Marcus.

13:21.966 --> 13:25.231
You ol' leech lover.

13:39.016 --> 13:41.314
Who is he?

13:41.352 --> 13:42.979
Him in there?

13:43.020 --> 13:44.817
Your master.

13:44.856 --> 13:46.983
His name's Kronos.

13:47.024 --> 13:48.787
Captain Kronos.

13:48.826 --> 13:51.158
And he's not my master.

13:51.195 --> 13:53.993
I'm merely an old army friend
passing through.

13:54.031 --> 13:56.295
As you wish.

13:56.334 --> 13:59.303
Your letter urged us
to make all speed,

13:59.337 --> 14:02.238
but gave no reason.

14:02.273 --> 14:05.731
Young girls suddenly
become greatly aged.

14:05.776 --> 14:08.074
Is that sufficient reason?

14:08.112 --> 14:12.776
And these girls, they died
with blood upon their lips?

14:13.951 --> 14:16.112
Yes. Why?

14:17.455 --> 14:19.082
Vampires.

14:19.123 --> 14:20.454
What?

14:20.491 --> 14:21.958
No, it can't be.

14:21.993 --> 14:24.518
What he doesn't know
about vampirism

14:24.562 --> 14:26.757
wouldn't fill a flea's codpiece.

14:26.797 --> 14:28.697
Vampires.

14:32.637 --> 14:36.937
Dr. Marcus, it is commonly
supposed that a vampire attacks

14:36.974 --> 14:39.636
in only one way...
by biting the neck

14:39.677 --> 14:41.110
and draining the victim
of blood.

14:41.145 --> 14:42.578
But that's true.

14:42.613 --> 14:44.808
The girls you spoke of,

14:44.849 --> 14:48.478
they were not drained of blood
but of youth.

14:48.519 --> 14:50.487
Of life itself.

14:50.521 --> 14:53.456
You see, Doctor, there are
as many species of vampire

14:53.491 --> 14:56.483
as there are beasts of prey.

14:56.527 --> 14:59.155
Their methods and their motive
for attack can vary

14:59.196 --> 15:00.925
in a hundred different ways.

15:00.965 --> 15:03.058
And the means
of their destruction.

15:03.100 --> 15:05.500
Aye, traditional stake
through the heart

15:05.536 --> 15:07.800
does not always hold good,
you know.

15:10.541 --> 15:14.409
Some can only be destroyed
by hanging or decapitation.

15:14.445 --> 15:16.913
Or fire or water.

15:16.948 --> 15:19.280
Or by other means.

15:19.317 --> 15:21.410
But these girls
were invulnerable.

15:21.452 --> 15:22.919
Each one wore a crucifix.

15:22.954 --> 15:26.082
The cross can only protect those
who firmly believe.

15:26.123 --> 15:29.581
But these were good girls
from God-fearing families.

15:29.627 --> 15:31.959
Perhaps their minds were not
their own

15:32.029 --> 15:33.621
at the moment of attack.

15:34.665 --> 15:38.294
I suspect mesmerism in this.

15:38.336 --> 15:39.462
Mesmerism?

15:39.503 --> 15:40.470
Hypnotism.

15:40.504 --> 15:41.766
The subjugation of the mind.

15:41.806 --> 15:44.434
Oh, you don't believe
in that nonsense.

15:44.475 --> 15:46.943
Well, it is
highly improbable.

15:46.978 --> 15:49.947
What could be more improbable
than God?

15:49.981 --> 15:52.779
But I believe in Him.

15:52.817 --> 15:54.148
And I, too, but...

15:54.185 --> 15:55.982
Thank you.

15:56.020 --> 15:57.988
...vampires?

15:58.055 --> 15:59.283
Oh, come now, Doctor.

15:59.323 --> 16:02.383
You had already reached
the same conclusion.

16:02.426 --> 16:04.417
Or why else send for us?

16:10.968 --> 16:14.768
Vampires...

16:14.805 --> 16:16.500
here in Durward.

17:53.404 --> 17:55.929
I suppose
you'll be moving on now?

17:55.973 --> 17:57.702
No, I'm staying.

17:59.410 --> 18:01.776
If you'll have me.

18:01.812 --> 18:03.541
Oh...

18:03.581 --> 18:05.310
I'll have you.

18:20.097 --> 18:21.064
What is it?

18:21.098 --> 18:22.065
What's happening?

18:22.099 --> 18:23.293
Time for us to start work.

18:23.334 --> 18:24.392
You want to come along?

18:24.435 --> 18:25.402
What work?

18:25.436 --> 18:26.903
Oh, didn't I mention it?

18:26.937 --> 18:28.063
We're vampire hunters.

18:28.105 --> 18:31.302
Professional vampire hunters.

19:54.024 --> 19:56.754
Paul?

19:56.794 --> 19:58.785
Dr. Marcus.

20:00.164 --> 20:01.153
To my shame,

20:01.198 --> 20:02.400
I'd completely forgotten.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.924
I'd completely forgotten.

20:03.968 --> 20:05.367
Seven years.

20:05.403 --> 20:07.132
Is it so long?

20:07.171 --> 20:09.139
To the day.

20:20.484 --> 20:22.509
Days and years

20:22.553 --> 20:24.077
flit by like a whisper,

20:24.121 --> 20:27.613
taking its toll of all of us.

20:27.658 --> 20:29.285
And healing old wounds.

20:29.326 --> 20:32.784
For some, but not all.

20:32.830 --> 20:34.661
Your mother still bears
a grudge?

20:34.698 --> 20:37.531
My father died in your hands,
remember?

20:37.568 --> 20:40.799
Yes, but of a plague,
a virulence.

20:40.838 --> 20:42.203
There was nothing I could do.

20:42.239 --> 20:43.467
There was no hope.

20:43.507 --> 20:45.805
I understand that,
my dear, Marcus,

20:45.843 --> 20:47.777
but my mother...

20:47.812 --> 20:49.541
She's there?

20:50.881 --> 20:53.145
You must allow me.

20:53.184 --> 20:54.708
My Lady Durward.

20:54.752 --> 20:56.879
She will not
acknowledge you, Doctor.

20:57.922 --> 21:00.186
Paul...

21:01.292 --> 21:03.260
Her face.

21:03.294 --> 21:04.852
She's become so aged.

21:04.895 --> 21:06.419
Your mother's sick.
She's ill.

21:06.464 --> 21:07.624
With grief.

21:07.665 --> 21:10.065
If only she would let me
examine her.

21:10.100 --> 21:11.499
She will see no one.

21:11.535 --> 21:12.763
Least of all you,
Dr. Marcus.

21:12.803 --> 21:13.770
Paul...

21:13.804 --> 21:14.964
Good day, Doctor.

21:16.640 --> 21:17.971
Paul?

22:18.969 --> 22:21.665
Toad in the hole.

22:25.509 --> 22:28.307
Not many more to do.

22:28.345 --> 22:29.972
Mark the spot.

23:08.285 --> 23:10.913
It's an old Chinese herb.

23:10.955 --> 23:12.252
Herb?

23:12.289 --> 23:15.588
I ought to be out
scouring the countryside,

23:15.626 --> 23:17.924
chasing after phantoms.

23:17.962 --> 23:19.657
Isn't that
what you're thinking?

23:22.066 --> 23:24.466
Never rush
into a battle unprepared.

23:24.501 --> 23:27.937
Remember, the war taught us
that, if nothing else.

23:27.972 --> 23:31.271
There's a time to think,
a time to plan

23:31.308 --> 23:33.139
and a time to act,

23:33.177 --> 23:36.510
and that time will come
soon enough, don't worry.

23:39.316 --> 23:41.284
I see my needlework
has held good.

23:41.318 --> 23:43.286
Mm-mmm.

23:43.320 --> 23:46.949
I know you've got guts, Kronos.

23:46.991 --> 23:48.481
I've seen them.

23:54.865 --> 23:55.991
Evening.

24:04.608 --> 24:07.577
I play chess.

24:07.611 --> 24:09.636
And I have a bottle
of very good wine

24:09.680 --> 24:11.272
tucked away for a rainy day.

24:17.621 --> 24:19.282
It's pouring.

25:11.508 --> 25:15.672
Queen to king,
and mate in one.

25:17.314 --> 25:19.942
There was blood on the mouth.

25:20.017 --> 25:23.475
In the church.

25:23.520 --> 25:26.045
Blood on the mouth.

25:26.090 --> 25:28.490
Just the mouth.

25:28.525 --> 25:30.959
Why?

25:30.994 --> 25:33.189
That's how he attacks them.

25:37.668 --> 25:39.636
Through the kiss.

25:44.274 --> 25:46.742
Oh...! Ooh...

25:49.346 --> 25:52.076
Oh...

26:12.436 --> 26:13.903
What's wrong?

26:13.937 --> 26:16.462
I thought I saw someone
over there.

26:18.776 --> 26:19.936
Ah, you're
imagining things.

26:20.043 --> 26:21.567
No, there was someone.

26:21.612 --> 26:23.170
Probably a forester.

26:23.213 --> 26:25.204
No, it was someone old.

26:25.249 --> 26:26.910
Someone very old.

26:26.950 --> 26:28.508
I think it was a man...

26:39.530 --> 26:41.862
Oh, really,
I ought to be going now.

26:41.899 --> 26:43.127
I'll take you home.

26:43.167 --> 26:44.293
And have my father see you?

26:44.334 --> 26:45.460
He'd skin me alive
and you, too.

26:45.502 --> 26:46.799
Well, look, you can't go alone.

26:46.837 --> 26:48.930
Not with everything that's
been happening around here.

26:48.972 --> 26:50.633
Now, look, there's
the edge of the forest,

26:50.674 --> 26:51.641
and there's my house.

26:51.675 --> 26:52.972
Now, what could possibly happen

26:53.010 --> 26:53.977
in that short a distance?

26:54.011 --> 26:54.978
Ah, well, just the same,

26:55.012 --> 26:55.979
I'll-I'll stay here
and watch

26:56.013 --> 26:57.139
till you're out of the woods.

26:57.181 --> 26:58.148
Silly.

26:58.182 --> 27:00.116
Silly.

27:00.150 --> 27:01.777
See you tomorrow.

27:48.899 --> 27:50.730
Myra?!

27:55.005 --> 27:57.473
Myra...

27:57.507 --> 27:58.940
Myra.

28:01.111 --> 28:02.772
Myra!

28:16.225 --> 28:19.854
Another, and this time,
we have an eyewitness!

28:38.481 --> 28:40.108
I stood and watched her,

28:40.149 --> 28:42.276
and she was never
out of sight.

28:42.318 --> 28:44.946
Never completely out of sight.

28:44.987 --> 28:47.114
But you saw no one else?

28:47.156 --> 28:48.123
No one at all?

28:48.157 --> 28:51.786
No. Oh, Myra thought
she saw someone.

28:51.828 --> 28:53.090
Who did she see?

28:54.330 --> 28:56.798
Just someone very old,
she said.

28:56.833 --> 28:59.529
Very old.

29:43.546 --> 29:44.911
You're mystified?

29:44.947 --> 29:46.141
Mm!

29:46.182 --> 29:48.810
Well, you've a right to be.

29:48.851 --> 29:52.150
Grost ringed the forest
with dead toads.

29:52.188 --> 29:54.554
"If a vampire should bestrode

29:54.590 --> 29:57.457
"close to the grave
of a dead toad,

29:57.493 --> 30:00.291
"then the vampire life
shall give,

30:00.329 --> 30:04.459
and suddenly the toad
shall live."

30:04.500 --> 30:08.095
It's an old folk rhyme,
and like most of them,

30:08.137 --> 30:10.571
there's a grain of truth in it.

30:36.165 --> 30:38.895
"Then the vampire life
shall give,

30:38.935 --> 30:41.802
and suddenly
the toad shall live."

30:49.912 --> 30:52.346
A coach or a wagon
of some kind.

30:54.984 --> 30:58.420
Recent, too.

30:58.454 --> 31:01.048
Four horses.

31:01.090 --> 31:03.786
Grost!

31:03.826 --> 31:05.794
We'll ride
over that way,

31:05.828 --> 31:07.193
take a look.

31:07.230 --> 31:10.529
Look for what,
someone very old?

31:10.566 --> 31:11.965
On the contrary.

31:12.068 --> 31:16.164
This thing attacks to
sustain life, youth.

31:16.205 --> 31:18.730
That's what we'll be seeking.

31:18.774 --> 31:21.504
A cheek with a bloom to it.

31:21.544 --> 31:23.910
Someone young and fair.

31:23.946 --> 31:26.278
Fetch the horses!

31:36.459 --> 31:38.950
Hmm... dead end.

31:40.363 --> 31:42.297
What lies down there?

31:42.331 --> 31:43.298
Oh, the village.

31:43.332 --> 31:44.924
Oh, it's hardly a village.

31:44.967 --> 31:46.867
Just a few houses
and a tavern.

31:46.903 --> 31:48.302
We'll try it.

31:53.709 --> 31:54.835
It'd make better sense

31:54.877 --> 31:56.708
if I stayed
and had a look 'round up here.

32:15.932 --> 32:18.230
Whoa.

32:30.579 --> 32:31.978
Now, there's a funny thing.

32:32.014 --> 32:33.140
What's a funny thing?

32:33.182 --> 32:34.479
That soldier fellow.

32:34.517 --> 32:36.212
The chap who's staying
with Dr. Marcus.

32:36.252 --> 32:37.514
And what about him?

32:37.553 --> 32:39.350
Going around asking
if anybody's seen

32:39.388 --> 32:41.322
ought of a coach or a wagon
'round here

32:41.357 --> 32:42.824
in the past few hours?

32:42.858 --> 32:45.986
Offering a golden guinea
to anybody who can help him.

32:46.028 --> 32:47.290
A golden guinea.

32:47.330 --> 32:49.127
A man could buy himself
a deal of pleasure

32:49.165 --> 32:50.655
with that kind of money,
eh, Molly?

32:50.700 --> 32:51.826
Aye.

32:51.867 --> 32:52.834
Is Kerro here?

32:52.868 --> 32:54.335
- He's around.
- Where?

32:54.370 --> 32:55.337
He's upstairs.

32:55.371 --> 32:56.838
With a doxy.

32:56.872 --> 32:58.362
Here he is now.

33:52.528 --> 33:54.826
Here, girl.

33:54.864 --> 33:56.923
And that's double
what you're worth.

33:56.966 --> 33:59.491
You promised me more.

34:00.870 --> 34:01.859
You promised.

34:01.904 --> 34:03.895
And so I did.

34:29.864 --> 34:31.856
You're not laughing.

34:34.904 --> 34:36.371
Laugh.

34:36.405 --> 34:38.032
Please, Kerro.

34:39.442 --> 34:41.774
Laugh, I'm telling you.

34:44.513 --> 34:46.036
I'll be damned if I will.

34:56.958 --> 34:58.221
Laugh.

35:00.463 --> 35:02.328
Louder.

35:05.634 --> 35:07.534
Louder.

35:09.605 --> 35:13.063
Oh, that's much better.

35:35.131 --> 35:36.621
There's a good boy.

35:42.338 --> 35:44.306
Bye.

35:51.514 --> 35:52.981
Kerro.

36:05.127 --> 36:07.493
When you talk to him,
speak soft.

36:07.530 --> 36:08.827
I'll do better than that.

36:10.199 --> 36:12.667
I'll speak money.

36:59.582 --> 37:02.244
Dr. Marcus...

37:02.284 --> 37:04.616
this is an unexpected pleasure.

37:04.653 --> 37:06.245
Paul.

37:06.288 --> 37:08.279
Good day to you.

37:08.324 --> 37:09.450
I was just passing.

37:09.492 --> 37:10.789
I thought the least I could do

37:10.826 --> 37:12.555
is to offer my respects
to your mother.

37:12.595 --> 37:15.655
And I shall be pleased
to convey them to her.

37:15.698 --> 37:17.666
But I doubt
if she will even listen.

37:21.737 --> 37:24.205
But a kind thought
nonetheless.

37:24.240 --> 37:25.207
Paul...

37:25.241 --> 37:27.368
A brandy to warm you
after your ride?

37:27.409 --> 37:28.967
Thank you.

37:37.286 --> 37:39.311
Mmm. It will be most welcome.

37:40.823 --> 37:42.347
How is your mother?

37:42.391 --> 37:44.359
No better.

37:44.393 --> 37:47.328
But your dear sister,
Sara, she's well?

37:47.363 --> 37:48.694
Very.

37:48.731 --> 37:50.631
I'm delighted to hear it.

37:52.835 --> 37:54.393
Your health, Doctor.

37:54.436 --> 37:56.927
Thank you.

37:56.972 --> 37:59.270
Witchcraft and Necromancy.

38:00.910 --> 38:02.605
The book.

38:02.645 --> 38:04.306
Oh, it was my father's.

38:04.346 --> 38:07.008
At long last I'm setting
his library to rights.

38:07.049 --> 38:10.541
Witchcraft and Necromancy.

38:10.586 --> 38:13.919
That's the rumor in the village.

38:13.956 --> 38:16.823
Yes. A grim business.

38:16.859 --> 38:18.622
What's your opinion of it?

38:18.661 --> 38:21.061
My brother
does not form opinions

38:21.096 --> 38:22.654
too readily, Dr. Marcus.

38:22.698 --> 38:24.666
Oh, no.

38:24.700 --> 38:27.066
He broods upon a problem
a long time.

38:31.807 --> 38:33.798
Is that not so, Paul?

38:33.843 --> 38:35.435
You know I would not dare

38:35.477 --> 38:37.274
to disagree with you,
dear sister.

38:43.786 --> 38:45.686
My dear Sara,

38:45.721 --> 38:47.313
you look lovelier than ever.

38:47.356 --> 38:48.948
And younger.

38:49.024 --> 38:50.150
What's your secret?

38:50.192 --> 38:52.786
Well, she's not exactly
an aged crone, you know.

38:52.828 --> 38:55.058
Nor ever will be.

38:55.097 --> 38:58.931
"Crone" is such an ugly word,
don't you think?

38:58.968 --> 39:02.131
Such an ugly thing to be.

39:02.171 --> 39:03.570
No, I don't think

39:03.606 --> 39:05.164
I shall ever be one.

39:07.209 --> 39:08.733
Am I unwell, Doctor?

39:09.745 --> 39:11.110
You're studying me so closely,

39:11.146 --> 39:13.341
I thought, perhaps,
you could detect some malady

39:13.382 --> 39:15.043
in my face.

39:15.084 --> 39:17.712
No, your face is perfect...

39:17.753 --> 39:19.015
magically perfect.

39:19.054 --> 39:20.248
Magic?

39:21.824 --> 39:23.655
Well, I must be on my way.

39:23.692 --> 39:25.023
Sara.

39:25.060 --> 39:26.618
Paul, thank you for the brandy.

39:28.397 --> 39:29.796
Good day to you both.

40:00.996 --> 40:02.964
Mother, you wanted me?

40:02.998 --> 40:05.558
Yes.

40:05.601 --> 40:09.401
Someone called just now.

40:09.438 --> 40:11.565
It was Dr. Marcus.

40:11.607 --> 40:13.074
Marcus?

40:13.108 --> 40:14.700
What did he want?

40:14.743 --> 40:16.938
He said he was just passing by.

40:16.979 --> 40:19.106
Called to pay his respects.

40:19.148 --> 40:22.140
Passing by?

40:22.184 --> 40:25.381
This road doesn't lead anywhere.

40:27.856 --> 40:29.756
I know, Mother.

40:29.792 --> 40:31.692
I know.

40:48.377 --> 40:49.708
Red wine.

40:49.745 --> 40:50.803
The best you have.

40:50.846 --> 40:51.870
Yes, sir.

40:55.751 --> 40:59.312
Tell me, have you seen anything
of a coach or a wagon

40:59.355 --> 41:01.653
passing by recently?

41:01.690 --> 41:04.750
Nothing passes by here.

41:04.793 --> 41:09.730
Only... soldiers... deserters,
running away from the war.

41:09.765 --> 41:11.960
Come in here with big talk
of the battles they won...

41:12.001 --> 41:15.402
or with the look of lost battles
about them.

41:15.437 --> 41:16.961
What about you, Captain?

41:17.072 --> 41:18.164
'Tis "Captain"?

41:18.207 --> 41:19.606
Perhaps he stole the coat.

41:24.179 --> 41:27.273
Tell me, did you lose
your battles or win them?

41:29.018 --> 41:32.317
A little of both.

41:32.354 --> 41:34.345
And not enough of either.

41:39.762 --> 41:41.992
You haven't answered
my question.

41:42.031 --> 41:43.658
Coach or a wagon?

41:43.699 --> 41:47.226
Hey, you...
crookback.

41:52.241 --> 41:53.401
Tell me, uh...

41:54.710 --> 41:56.507
...how do you sleep at night?

41:56.545 --> 41:58.809
On your belly or...
or in a hammock?

41:58.847 --> 42:00.678
Or do you stick a hole
in the ground

42:00.716 --> 42:01.944
and put your hump in it?

42:01.984 --> 42:05.545
You see, we're interested,
crookback.

42:08.957 --> 42:12.290
His name is Grost.

42:12.327 --> 42:13.954
Crookback will do for me.

42:14.063 --> 42:15.189
But not me.

42:15.230 --> 42:16.356
Why?

42:16.398 --> 42:18.229
'Cause I don't like it.

42:18.267 --> 42:20.667
Oh...

42:25.641 --> 42:27.575
He doesn't like it.

42:28.944 --> 42:31.310
To make sport
of a physical affliction

42:31.346 --> 42:35.510
is both impolite and cruel.

42:35.551 --> 42:39.146
After all, I wouldn't dream
of calling you...

42:39.188 --> 42:40.348
rat face...

42:42.891 --> 42:44.984
...fatty...

42:48.797 --> 42:50.162
...or big mouth.

43:40.382 --> 43:42.247
You still haven't answered

43:42.284 --> 43:43.979
my question.

43:44.086 --> 43:45.986
Wagons or coaches, sir?

43:46.054 --> 43:47.681
No, we haven't seen nothing
like that.

43:47.723 --> 43:50.214
We haven't seen nothing at all.

43:50.259 --> 43:51.590
Pity.

44:10.045 --> 44:12.843
Marcus.

44:12.881 --> 44:15.441
Stand.

44:15.483 --> 44:17.951
Dr. Marcus.

44:18.019 --> 44:20.317
Sara?

44:20.355 --> 44:22.323
Marcus.

45:27.255 --> 45:29.189
They made sport of me, Kronos.

45:29.224 --> 45:30.418
They laughed at me.

45:38.600 --> 45:42.161
Am I so terribly ugly
to provoke such mockery?

45:44.739 --> 45:46.969
Am I?

45:49.010 --> 45:54.642
Beauty fades, eventually,
but a kind soul remains forever.

45:54.682 --> 45:57.583
My mother taught me that.

45:57.619 --> 46:01.419
She was a gifted woman.

46:01.456 --> 46:02.480
Very gifted.

46:05.560 --> 46:07.084
And you, my friend,

46:07.128 --> 46:09.562
my very dear friend,

46:09.597 --> 46:12.623
your body was given to you
by God.

46:12.667 --> 46:14.931
Just remember that.

46:18.740 --> 46:19.900
He also...

46:21.810 --> 46:24.142
...gave me a good friend
to protect me.

46:29.150 --> 46:30.583
They were paid to laugh at you.

46:31.853 --> 46:33.150
Those men...

46:33.188 --> 46:35.918
they were paid to provoke
a fight and kill us both.

46:35.957 --> 46:38.084
Is that so?

46:38.126 --> 46:40.094
If what you say is right,
then...

46:40.128 --> 46:41.857
It means we are getting close.

46:46.501 --> 46:48.628
Ah. Where did you get to?

46:50.371 --> 46:52.805
I rode over to the Durwards.

46:52.841 --> 46:54.672
You saw nothing of a coach?

46:56.411 --> 46:58.572
No. No, nothing.

46:59.614 --> 47:01.479
What was it then?

47:01.516 --> 47:03.984
A physicking or a visiting?

47:06.354 --> 47:09.482
I hear that Sara Durward
is quite a pretty bed-full.

47:09.524 --> 47:11.685
It was just a social visit.

47:16.097 --> 47:17.428
And you?

47:18.666 --> 47:23.865
Gained nothing, save a fumed
brain from too much wine.

47:26.140 --> 47:28.040
Still, nothing like
a leech or two...

47:28.076 --> 47:29.304
a little blood-letting

47:29.344 --> 47:32.142
to cool a man's veins, eh?

47:32.180 --> 47:34.171
Better remove our little friends

47:34.215 --> 47:35.648
before they turn blue.

47:35.683 --> 47:37.048
Blue?

47:37.085 --> 47:41.454
I'm from very
aristocratic stock.

47:41.489 --> 47:44.686
We are casting our net
further afield tonight, Doctor.

47:44.726 --> 47:46.353
Do you want to come along?

47:46.394 --> 47:47.361
Yes.

47:47.395 --> 47:49.659
Good.

47:51.332 --> 47:54.961
I will be looking
for something like these.

47:55.003 --> 47:57.028
Only a little bigger.

50:44.539 --> 50:47.872
She has touched nothing.

50:52.714 --> 50:54.841
She just lies there,

50:54.882 --> 50:56.713
like a thing already dead.

51:00.555 --> 51:03.115
I never knew such grief.

51:03.157 --> 51:06.285
She must have loved Father
very much.

51:06.327 --> 51:08.795
Sara, perhaps if you were
to go to her...

51:08.830 --> 51:10.798
I can't.

51:10.832 --> 51:12.129
I'm sorry, Paul,

51:12.166 --> 51:15.294
but I can't bear
to look at her anymore.

51:15.336 --> 51:18.499
To look at that face
that was once so beautiful.

51:20.174 --> 51:25.077
Age... frightens me.

51:25.113 --> 51:26.102
I'm vain, I know,

51:26.147 --> 51:28.081
but to look at Mother
is to look into a mirror

51:28.116 --> 51:29.811
of what one day I must become.

51:29.851 --> 51:31.910
No.

51:37.658 --> 51:40.821
We are Durwards, remember?

51:40.862 --> 51:42.489
Thoroughbreds.

51:42.530 --> 51:45.158
The Durwards have always
been renowned

51:45.199 --> 51:46.826
for their usefulness.

51:46.868 --> 51:47.926
Mother is a Durward.

51:47.969 --> 51:51.700
By marriage, not by birth.

51:51.739 --> 51:53.331
What has happened to Mother

51:53.374 --> 51:55.808
will not happen to us,
dear sister.

51:55.843 --> 51:58.209
I promise you.

51:58.246 --> 52:00.714
It will not happen to us.

52:31.012 --> 52:33.173
You're rough with me.

52:41.989 --> 52:43.854
So much bitterness.

52:45.026 --> 52:47.995
So much. Why?

52:48.095 --> 52:50.359
Why?

52:52.666 --> 52:56.261
I once went off to fight a war.

52:56.303 --> 53:00.501
I went off and left my mother
and my little sister behind me.

53:00.541 --> 53:02.600
The two people that I love most.

53:04.612 --> 53:05.704
When I returned,

53:05.746 --> 53:08.408
my sweet little sister
welcomed me with a kiss.

53:10.384 --> 53:12.944
Yes, both of them.

53:13.054 --> 53:17.252
Mother and sister, fallen
to the scourge of vampirism.

53:17.291 --> 53:19.953
I had to destroy them!

53:20.027 --> 53:21.961
I had to bare
their breasts,

53:22.063 --> 53:23.963
take a sharpened stake

53:23.998 --> 53:26.933
and drive it
through their hearts.

53:52.326 --> 53:53.987
Younger.

53:55.362 --> 53:57.694
Oh, no.

54:00.434 --> 54:01.765
Kronos!

54:03.971 --> 54:05.370
Kronos!

54:07.274 --> 54:08.901
Kronos!

54:08.943 --> 54:10.376
What is it?
What's wrong?

54:10.411 --> 54:12.242
My face. Look!

54:15.249 --> 54:17.513
Look at my face.

54:39.106 --> 54:40.334
Rope. Strong rope.

55:00.361 --> 55:02.261
Well?

55:02.296 --> 55:05.094
Hm... hard to say.

55:05.132 --> 55:06.258
You see?

55:06.300 --> 55:07.767
He's been bitten
on the mouth.

55:07.801 --> 55:08.927
For God's sake,

55:08.969 --> 55:10.266
I survived a vampire's bite.

55:10.304 --> 55:13.603
But he is not the man you are.

55:13.641 --> 55:15.302
Marcus?

55:17.311 --> 55:19.609
Marcus...

55:22.683 --> 55:25.743
It was me, wasn't it?

55:25.786 --> 55:28.277
That girl in the forest...

55:28.322 --> 55:30.449
it was I.

55:30.491 --> 55:32.459
Oh...

55:32.493 --> 55:34.586
Yes.

55:34.628 --> 55:36.755
I'm doomed.

55:36.797 --> 55:38.788
My soul in never-ending torment.

55:38.832 --> 55:40.629
It's... I...

55:40.668 --> 55:42.966
Oh, God.

55:43.003 --> 55:45.369
Kill me!

55:45.406 --> 55:49.308
Kill... kill me!

55:49.343 --> 55:51.174
If the situation were reversed,

55:51.212 --> 55:53.339
you would implore him
to do the same.

55:53.380 --> 55:54.779
Kronos, this must be done.

55:54.815 --> 55:56.305
We will not be killing him.

55:56.350 --> 55:57.339
He is dead already.

55:57.384 --> 55:58.976
But his death will bring life.

55:59.019 --> 56:00.680
It will give us
the knowledge we need

56:00.721 --> 56:02.655
to destroy this thing
that has infected him.

56:02.690 --> 56:05.090
For pity's sake, finish it!

56:05.125 --> 56:06.956
Finish it!

56:11.966 --> 56:14.434
Kill me!

56:17.137 --> 56:19.697
So be it.

56:49.837 --> 56:51.998
Well, come on!

57:18.465 --> 57:23.493
A vampire only bleeds
at the moment of its death.

58:38.979 --> 58:40.913
Grost.

58:50.491 --> 58:52.322
Myself...

58:54.661 --> 58:56.185
...again.

59:07.574 --> 59:10.566
But how did...?

59:10.611 --> 59:13.045
The flame didn't touch him.

59:32.599 --> 59:34.294
This is what killed him.

59:34.334 --> 59:36.564
A simple cross.

59:42.576 --> 59:45.204
Made of steel.

59:46.246 --> 59:48.214
Then we have our answer.

59:49.983 --> 59:51.473
Yes.

59:56.824 --> 59:58.348
And Marcus...

01:00:00.461 --> 01:00:03.157
...dear Marcus...

01:00:03.197 --> 01:00:06.600
is at peace at last.

01:00:28.188 --> 01:00:32.318
Dr. Marcus was a good man,
and a bad one killed him.

01:00:32.359 --> 01:00:33.826
Aye.

01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:35.851
It was that stranger
that did it.

01:00:35.895 --> 01:00:38.159
Him and that hunchback.

01:00:38.198 --> 01:00:40.928
They killed Dr. Marcus.

01:00:40.967 --> 01:00:43.265
Murdered him in cold blood.

01:00:48.642 --> 01:00:50.701
We'll make it a life for a life.

01:01:13.633 --> 01:01:14.793
Kronos!

01:04:14.881 --> 01:04:16.280
Kronos.

01:04:20.987 --> 01:04:23.820
A sword fit for a king.

01:04:26.192 --> 01:04:29.025
Or a Kronos.

01:04:56.222 --> 01:04:57.883
Oh, Barton.

01:04:57.924 --> 01:04:59.619
You frightened
the life out of me.

01:04:59.659 --> 01:05:01.490
I couldn't sleep.

01:05:01.527 --> 01:05:03.188
This damn storm.

01:05:03.229 --> 01:05:04.560
Nor I.

01:05:04.597 --> 01:05:06.224
Thought I'd warm a little milk.

01:05:06.266 --> 01:05:08.496
We'll both be like death
in the morning.

01:05:22.382 --> 01:05:26.318
I keep thinking of Vanda...
and Isabella.

01:05:26.352 --> 01:05:28.752
Well, don't.

01:05:28.788 --> 01:05:30.688
It's best that we don't.

01:05:32.492 --> 01:05:34.551
Oh, I wish Father were home.

01:08:08.448 --> 01:08:13.476
His reputation was formidable.

01:08:13.519 --> 01:08:16.352
It is said that
few saw his blade,

01:08:16.389 --> 01:08:22.453
but only felt it
when it found its mark.

01:08:22.495 --> 01:08:24.429
He never met his match.

01:08:24.464 --> 01:08:27.490
Except in God.

01:08:27.533 --> 01:08:30.559
He was kin to you?

01:08:30.603 --> 01:08:33.071
He was my father.

01:08:33.106 --> 01:08:35.233
Oh.

01:08:35.274 --> 01:08:37.265
Forgive me, I did not know

01:08:37.310 --> 01:08:39.710
that I stood
with my Lady Durward.

01:08:39.745 --> 01:08:40.904
Kronos.

01:08:40.947 --> 01:08:43.245
Captain Kronos, m'lady.

01:08:43.282 --> 01:08:45.750
Sara?

01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:49.850
M'lady.

01:09:09.241 --> 01:09:11.640
Is it possible, Grost?

01:09:15.014 --> 01:09:18.779
Marcus said he went up
to see the Durwards.

01:09:18.818 --> 01:09:21.252
But such a creature.

01:09:21.287 --> 01:09:26.589
She is beautiful,
young and fair and...

01:09:26.625 --> 01:09:29.287
Exactly.

01:09:29.328 --> 01:09:32.729
Well, we'll know one way
or another soon enough.

01:10:01.027 --> 01:10:02.016
Garlic flower.

01:10:21.047 --> 01:10:23.572
You're sure you want
to go through with this?

01:10:24.683 --> 01:10:26.446
You'll be the bait, you know?

01:10:26.485 --> 01:10:28.214
I know.

01:10:28.254 --> 01:10:29.721
Excuse me.

01:11:07.326 --> 01:11:10.659
Time to make our move,
my friend.

01:11:13.299 --> 01:11:15.699
Time to kill a vampire.

01:11:16.702 --> 01:11:17.964
Mother?

01:11:20.539 --> 01:11:25.033
If only you would drink this,
you would feel stronger.

01:11:50.136 --> 01:11:52.764
Where the devil is Barlow?

01:13:04.643 --> 01:13:06.668
Thank you, sir.

01:13:08.247 --> 01:13:11.114
Now, an explanation, I think.

01:13:12.651 --> 01:13:14.278
What were you doing out there?

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:17.915
Getting more frightened
every minute.

01:13:17.957 --> 01:13:19.754
More and more lost.

01:13:19.792 --> 01:13:22.317
I ran away, sir, from my father.

01:13:22.361 --> 01:13:24.921
He would force me into marriage
when it's another I love.

01:13:24.964 --> 01:13:28.559
Please, if I could stay here
just for tonight, sir.

01:13:28.601 --> 01:13:30.432
I beg of you.

01:13:30.469 --> 01:13:32.767
Of course, you may stay.

01:13:32.805 --> 01:13:34.067
I'll prepare a room.

01:13:34.106 --> 01:13:35.630
No. No, Your Ladyship.

01:13:35.674 --> 01:13:37.767
I've already presumed too much

01:13:37.810 --> 01:13:38.970
on your kindness.

01:13:39.011 --> 01:13:40.979
Nonsense...
it'll take but a moment.

01:13:41.013 --> 01:13:43.607
I can stay here...
before the fire.

01:13:43.649 --> 01:13:44.707
I'd prefer it.

01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:47.480
Very well, then.

01:13:47.519 --> 01:13:49.009
As you wish.

01:14:11.310 --> 01:14:13.107
Good night to you, then.

01:14:13.145 --> 01:14:14.544
Good night.

01:14:25.391 --> 01:14:27.757
Good night, dear sister.

01:14:47.446 --> 01:14:48.879
Sleep well.

01:18:34.173 --> 01:18:36.471
Sara, what the devil's going on?

01:18:40.979 --> 01:18:42.276
Paul...

01:18:42.314 --> 01:18:44.077
her face.

01:18:45.584 --> 01:18:46.983
Her face!

01:18:53.525 --> 01:18:54.924
Mother?

01:18:57.096 --> 01:19:00.691
The bloom of youth...

01:19:00.732 --> 01:19:04.327
why should that appall you?

01:19:04.369 --> 01:19:07.395
Is it wrong to be young
and beautiful again?

01:19:09.007 --> 01:19:13.000
You forget...
I'm a Costine by birth,

01:19:13.045 --> 01:19:17.414
and the Costines are blessed
with many dark secrets.

01:19:19.451 --> 01:19:22.420
It has taken me seven years...

01:19:22.454 --> 01:19:26.185
seven long years
to bring them into play,

01:19:26.225 --> 01:19:29.251
to make me
what I am now:

01:19:29.294 --> 01:19:33.162
never to grow old.

01:19:33.198 --> 01:19:36.497
Isn't that as precious
as life itself?

01:19:36.535 --> 01:19:39.470
It is life itself.

01:19:39.505 --> 01:19:42.167
And so life begins again.

01:19:42.207 --> 01:19:47.167
Begins again for me
and for your father.

01:19:47.212 --> 01:19:48.679
Father is dead.

01:19:48.714 --> 01:19:49.942
No.

01:19:49.982 --> 01:19:51.813
Father is dead.

01:19:51.850 --> 01:19:52.942
Dead of the plague.

01:19:53.018 --> 01:19:56.112
No.

01:19:56.155 --> 01:19:58.715
Never dead.

01:19:58.757 --> 01:20:02.284
Just sleeping...

01:20:02.327 --> 01:20:05.296
as you shall see for yourself.

01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:27.316
I awakened him,

01:20:27.352 --> 01:20:29.820
brought him back from the dead.

01:20:29.855 --> 01:20:32.289
My husband...

01:20:32.324 --> 01:20:35.555
my lover...

01:20:35.594 --> 01:20:38.119
back into my arms.

01:20:42.134 --> 01:20:43.795
But I see

01:20:43.835 --> 01:20:45.826
you do not understand.

01:20:45.871 --> 01:20:47.896
Come here, my children.

01:20:53.545 --> 01:20:55.308
Come here.

01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:23.134
You will remember nothing

01:21:23.175 --> 01:21:25.473
of what has passed here.

01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:29.071
Do you understand?

01:21:32.317 --> 01:21:37.311
Later, you will awaken
and remember nothing.

01:21:37.356 --> 01:21:40.257
Come, my darling.

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:57.533
Her life will be yours.

01:21:59.077 --> 01:22:01.944
Yours.

01:22:02.014 --> 01:22:06.383
Her youth will pulse
through your veins, my darling.

01:22:08.553 --> 01:22:10.453
Replenishing...

01:22:10.489 --> 01:22:12.548
restoring...

01:22:15.227 --> 01:22:18.492
Take her.

01:22:18.530 --> 01:22:20.896
Take her!

01:23:07.446 --> 01:23:09.175
My Lord Durward.

01:23:13.652 --> 01:23:15.711
At your service, sir.

01:23:19.991 --> 01:23:21.219
To the death.

01:23:21.259 --> 01:23:23.591
So be it.

01:24:17.983 --> 01:24:21.680
Yes, you bleed, my lord.

01:24:25.190 --> 01:24:27.055
This is God's blade.

01:24:28.493 --> 01:24:31.690
Forged for your black heart.

01:25:08.801 --> 01:25:10.496
Die!

01:26:32.118 --> 01:26:34.518
You can't hurt me, Kronos.

01:26:35.955 --> 01:26:37.616
No.

01:26:37.657 --> 01:26:38.919
You can't kill me.

01:26:42.362 --> 01:26:44.159
Kronos!

01:29:16.215 --> 01:29:18.445
Marcus.

01:29:18.484 --> 01:29:20.475
Dear Marcus.

01:29:31.230 --> 01:29:33.164
You must go now.

01:29:35.067 --> 01:29:37.092
Go where?

01:29:37.136 --> 01:29:38.603
Anywhere.

01:29:38.638 --> 01:29:40.162
Everywhere.

01:29:40.206 --> 01:29:43.039
Wherever there is evil
to be fought.

01:29:44.644 --> 01:29:47.272
But on lonely nights,

01:29:47.313 --> 01:29:50.339
I shall think of you.

01:30:00.993 --> 01:30:03.729
And I you.
