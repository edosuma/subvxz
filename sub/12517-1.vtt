01:40.133 --> 01:43.227
There is a warning to
the 701 team member

01:44.170 --> 01:46.968
You have entered the prohibited zone
of the military base

01:47.240 --> 01:48.798
Do not proceed further

01:48.842 --> 01:50.366
Surrender now

01:51.077 --> 01:53.545
We will escort you back
to the Experiment Block

01:53.713 --> 01:55.772
We are acting
under a special permission to kill

01:55.815 --> 01:58.841
Any counter attack will result
in a full force attack

02:06.392 --> 02:08.690
You are surrounded

02:08.728 --> 02:10.821
drop your weapons and surrender at once

04:33.439 --> 04:36.272
I adopt a new identity
my name is now Tsui Chik

04:36.442 --> 04:39.411
I am the librarian here

04:39.579 --> 04:43.948
For me, this is the perfect place

04:44.083 --> 04:46.745
Here
I can look up anything that interests me

04:46.786 --> 04:49.050
Also, there are usually hardly
anyone around

04:50.990 --> 04:53.720
except for those few nosy people

04:53.760 --> 04:57.457
No, you've typed wrongly again

05:04.003 --> 05:07.530
Tracy, it's not your first time
Take it easy

05:07.707 --> 05:09.607
But this has got to be a new record

05:09.642 --> 05:13.840
I got dumped even before
I find out his name!

05:14.781 --> 05:17.375
The one who's crying is Tracy

05:17.417 --> 05:19.317
Nicknamed "Update"

05:19.352 --> 05:20.683
he claims she's always
at the forefront of fashion

05:20.720 --> 05:22.585
and she specializes a falling in
and out of love

05:23.022 --> 05:24.956
that's why she cries a lot

05:26.626 --> 05:28.821
This is the chief of the library

05:28.995 --> 05:30.690
He looks tough

05:30.897 --> 05:32.262
but deep down, he's really a good guy

05:32.298 --> 05:34.027
He likes to joke a lot

05:36.369 --> 05:40.237
As for me
this is the best shelter for me

05:40.373 --> 05:42.637
It allows me to quietly search for
the most basic quality in a human

05:42.975 --> 05:44.272
Feeling

05:45.278 --> 05:47.473
Tracy, you should know better than
anyone else

05:48.781 --> 05:51.944
Good looking hunks are the worst lot

05:53.086 --> 05:56.749
But he's only 5 ft. 2
how can he be a hunk?

05:58.191 --> 06:00.091
He must be rich then

06:00.293 --> 06:02.921
Rich men are just as bad

06:03.096 --> 06:04.893
For me, if he's not a hunk
he'd better be rich

06:04.931 --> 06:06.728
If he has neither, who wants him?

06:07.967 --> 06:10.800
I want someone for his personality

06:10.937 --> 06:15.135
Tracy, be practical
find someone who is common

06:15.174 --> 06:18.610
You never know
this someone may just be around the corner

06:24.784 --> 06:26.251
Wait

06:27.620 --> 06:29.212
I hope you are not
referring to yourselves?

06:29.489 --> 06:31.081
No

06:31.124 --> 06:33.558
Aren't we kind to you?

06:33.593 --> 06:37.256
Maybe just a casual relationship

06:39.632 --> 06:41.327
Actually, do you have someone in mind?

06:42.635 --> 06:43.863
Over there

06:52.879 --> 06:54.540
That piece of wood?

06:55.915 --> 06:57.576
A real nerd!

07:01.454 --> 07:05.220
Tracy, haven't you suffered enough
from those heartless guys?

07:05.291 --> 07:07.020
That's right, Tsui Chik

07:07.059 --> 07:09.653
He's always here, I never see him go out

07:09.796 --> 07:12.026
He must have saved up a lot of money

07:12.331 --> 07:14.492
He doesn't smoke or drink

07:14.534 --> 07:16.434
doesn't gamble either

07:16.469 --> 07:18.835
How can you be sure that
he doesn't gamble?

07:19.772 --> 07:21.364
Tsui Chik

07:22.141 --> 07:23.574
Come over here

07:25.478 --> 07:26.945
Yes, chief?

07:27.447 --> 07:28.778
Let's play mahjong after work

07:30.016 --> 07:31.506
Don't you have enough players already?

07:33.219 --> 07:34.618
Szeto's got a date

07:35.121 --> 07:37.988
So, what do you say? Be a good sport!

07:39.258 --> 07:42.159
Normally
how much can you win in one game?

07:42.195 --> 07:44.095
You can win $300-$500
on a very lucky night

07:48.501 --> 07:49.593
Hooked!

07:52.171 --> 07:54.264
Here's $300
alright, consider me having lost

07:54.307 --> 07:55.569
I'll take it

07:55.608 --> 07:56.700
I really don't know the game

07:56.742 --> 07:58.039
and I've a lot of books I must read

07:58.177 --> 08:00.577
That's ridiculous, how can you hand over
your money just like that?

08:00.746 --> 08:02.270
I hardly ever spend money anyway

08:02.315 --> 08:03.748
I'll go sort out the books

08:03.783 --> 08:04.477
He...

08:04.517 --> 08:06.451
Tsui Chik

08:07.587 --> 08:10.249
How can anyone love reading so much?

08:10.289 --> 08:12.280
These days
man like this only exists in fictions

08:12.325 --> 08:14.225
This kind of man is like dinosaur

08:14.260 --> 08:16.558
You better act quickly

08:21.567 --> 08:23.762
Loving him or not is another matter
just take it as gambling

08:23.803 --> 08:25.395
Just like playing mahjong

08:25.438 --> 08:26.598
Right...

08:26.639 --> 08:28.698
Even you two have to break up in future

08:28.741 --> 08:31.733
you can brush him off first

08:31.777 --> 08:34.575
Don't hesitate anymore, act now

08:34.614 --> 08:37.048
Ask him for a date! Hurry up!

08:37.082 --> 08:38.414
Right, date him!

08:38.451 --> 08:39.509
Go!

08:45.191 --> 08:46.249
Tsui... Tsui!

08:48.494 --> 08:49.688
Chik!

08:51.731 --> 08:53.494
I'm wondering...

08:56.435 --> 08:57.493
You are expecting someone?

08:58.771 --> 08:59.999
Can we go now?

09:00.039 --> 09:01.097
I am waiting

09:02.909 --> 09:05.673
I beg you not to whisper
in my ear again, OK?

09:06.245 --> 09:07.303
Let's go

09:16.589 --> 09:17.920
Your turn

09:22.328 --> 09:24.592
He's a cop. Nicknamed the rock

09:24.630 --> 09:26.757
Dark and hard, true to his name

09:26.799 --> 09:29.233
We get along very well

09:29.268 --> 09:32.066
more importantly
he has never asked about my background

09:32.338 --> 09:34.067
I feel safe with him

09:34.106 --> 09:36.006
He is my only friend

09:36.909 --> 09:39.969
Your turn now. You are pretty slow today

09:40.146 --> 09:42.410
Anything on your mind?
Cases you can't solve?

09:43.049 --> 09:45.210
Of course not!

09:45.785 --> 09:46.843
No?

09:47.553 --> 09:50.613
I read in the newspaper that over 30
drug lords have been killed in the last 5 days

09:50.790 --> 09:53.486
Aren't you on this case?

09:55.728 --> 09:57.093
I'll take your castle!

09:58.631 --> 10:01.259
It's not important who's on the case

10:01.300 --> 10:03.666
As far as I'm concerned
these scumbags are better dead

10:07.506 --> 10:09.303
You should not fight violence
by using violence.

10:09.842 --> 10:10.774
Knight taken!

10:11.177 --> 10:12.610
Problem still unsolved?

10:12.812 --> 10:15.713
I'll have to take charge

10:15.748 --> 10:16.976
and eliminate them all for good

10:18.851 --> 10:21.581
Why go for complete destruction?

10:21.621 --> 10:23.452
Allow them a path to survival

10:24.423 --> 10:25.856
I'll let the law decide their fate

10:25.891 --> 10:27.552
Queen taken. Your turn!

10:27.593 --> 10:30.153
The law is seldom as effective as we are

10:30.196 --> 10:32.630
Find a good lawyer

10:32.665 --> 10:34.030
and you can run free

10:37.203 --> 10:39.501
Checkmate!

10:41.173 --> 10:44.438
Don't you say we should allow
a path for survival?

10:44.477 --> 10:46.570
Playing chess is different...

10:46.612 --> 10:47.738
Let's have another game

10:48.014 --> 10:49.311
Should I give you a handicap?

10:56.789 --> 10:57.949
What did I say wrong?

10:57.990 --> 11:00.117
I punch you for no reason
aren't you mad?

11:01.193 --> 11:02.785
You must have your reason
for punching me

11:02.828 --> 11:04.159
I have no reason whatsoever

11:04.196 --> 11:05.754
Really?

11:06.732 --> 11:08.324
Forget it, let's concentrate on the game
Have you never lost your temper?

11:09.101 --> 11:11.365
you never get angry, don't you?

11:11.404 --> 11:14.202
In this messy world
you must be able to protect yourself

11:14.240 --> 11:16.367
Isn't it nice to be a gentle person?

11:16.409 --> 11:17.239
You just said it

11:17.276 --> 11:19.471
Over 30 drug lords were killed

11:19.512 --> 11:20.809
In this world
which is filled with violence

11:20.846 --> 11:22.040
if you can't protect yourself

11:22.081 --> 11:23.776
you won't survive

11:23.816 --> 11:25.545
Do you get it?

11:25.584 --> 11:26.881
Come on, let's carry on

11:26.919 --> 11:28.614
I must educate you

11:32.258 --> 11:33.316
Where are you going?

11:34.026 --> 11:35.323
I must take relieve

11:37.063 --> 11:38.587
Wait till after you finish this game

11:39.899 --> 11:42.629
Brother Tai, Ah Choi of the Wo Yee Hall
called and said that

11:42.668 --> 11:44.659
the leaders of the Four Great Families
are gathered already

11:44.704 --> 11:46.604
But we're still unable to
contact King Kau

11:46.639 --> 11:50.336
They suspect that all 36 drugs dealers
were killed by King

11:54.380 --> 11:55.506
These old foxes

11:55.548 --> 11:58.210
King Kau got the blame only because
he didn't put in an appearance

11:58.250 --> 12:01.447
Without a convicted murderer
everyone is still a suspect

12:01.487 --> 12:05.116
Remember!
Don't underestimate those old guys

12:05.391 --> 12:08.121
Or you will fall into their traps easily

12:09.528 --> 12:11.018
Brother Tai, you're right

12:11.330 --> 12:12.763
None of them can be trusted

12:13.566 --> 12:15.363
There are three Mercedez approaching

12:15.401 --> 12:16.493
Got it, let them in

12:20.539 --> 12:21.665
Check it out

12:26.545 --> 12:28.012
Brother Tai, no problem

12:31.617 --> 12:32.845
Today, I'll show them what I am made of

12:32.885 --> 12:34.079
Got you. Brother Tai

12:38.124 --> 12:41.093
What happened?
We talked to them only five minutes ago

12:43.562 --> 12:44.494
They are all dead now

12:44.530 --> 12:45.519
Let's go

12:56.342 --> 12:57.639
Brother, be careful

13:00.546 --> 13:03.037
King Kau isn't dead yet. It's him!

13:03.616 --> 13:05.208
Saur, something has gone very wrong here

13:05.251 --> 13:06.513
come in quickly to save me!

13:07.586 --> 13:08.575
Why is there no answer?

13:08.621 --> 13:10.782
Answer me!

13:11.991 --> 13:13.720
Are you all dead?

13:23.669 --> 13:26.763
King Kau, you want to take
all the territories? Can you handle it?

13:28.274 --> 13:29.263
Brother

13:30.309 --> 13:33.540
Saur, protect me, protect me!

13:36.749 --> 13:38.148
Don't kill me! I am not Saur

13:38.184 --> 13:39.116
Who are you?

13:39.151 --> 13:41.346
With your death, we have now eliminated
about all of the drug dealers in Hong Kong

13:54.567 --> 13:56.967
Your watch is here
don't leave it behind

14:05.811 --> 14:07.335
Do you have any money on you?

14:07.379 --> 14:08.846
I don't even have enough money
to take the metro home

14:08.881 --> 14:10.439
Can you lend me some money?

14:11.217 --> 14:12.275
Take it

14:13.118 --> 14:13.982
Twenty dollars?

14:14.019 --> 14:16.886
What good is it? Do you have any more?
Give it all to me

14:19.091 --> 14:20.752
I have only another fifty

14:21.560 --> 14:22.390
Seventy dollars is all you have?

14:22.428 --> 14:24.919
You go out with only
seventy dollars on you?

14:24.964 --> 14:26.431
Yes, that's all I have

14:27.099 --> 14:27.758
What is this?

14:27.800 --> 14:28.494
A chess set

14:28.534 --> 14:29.694
Really?

14:31.904 --> 14:32.836
Damn it!

14:32.972 --> 14:34.530
What good is a chess set?

14:34.573 --> 14:36.131
Don't move! Hands up!

14:36.175 --> 14:37.608
I have no money!
What are you doing here?

14:37.643 --> 14:39.042
Check whether he has money or not?
I've given everything to you

14:39.078 --> 14:40.045
Stop searching, I have no more money

14:40.079 --> 14:40.977
Why don't you have money?

14:41.013 --> 14:42.105
Where did you hide your money? Speak up

14:42.181 --> 14:43.443
What are you laughing at?
You are threatened by a knife!

14:43.482 --> 14:44.540
Why do you laugh?

14:53.759 --> 14:54.748
Watch your knife!

14:56.228 --> 14:57.695
It's because of people like you
who are too cowardly

14:57.730 --> 14:59.322
That the bad guys are getting
more and more out of control

14:59.498 --> 15:00.795
It's none of my business!

15:00.833 --> 15:02.562
Now, let me teach you a lesson
Come on

15:02.601 --> 15:03.829
Punch him

15:04.336 --> 15:06.099
You have already done
the serious punching. If I join in

15:06.138 --> 15:07.730
I think they will die

15:08.340 --> 15:10.433
You are not always lucky!
I am not always with you...

15:10.476 --> 15:11.966
to protect you

15:18.951 --> 15:20.714
Something urgent has come up, I must run

15:23.422 --> 15:24.514
Hey, your watch!

15:32.631 --> 15:33.655
News round up:

15:33.699 --> 15:35.690
This afternoon at the loading dock
of Kwun Tong Pier

15:35.734 --> 15:37.668
one hundred drug dealers
were slaughtered

15:37.703 --> 15:39.762
Only one man was found alive
but he was seriously injured

15:39.805 --> 15:40.863
He is being sent to a hospital
for emergency treatment

15:44.109 --> 15:45.098
Where am I?

15:45.144 --> 15:46.736
Police
we are sending you to the hospital

15:46.779 --> 15:49.407
I am not going to the hospital

15:49.448 --> 15:51.348
Don't worry. You are the only survivor

15:51.383 --> 15:52.611
we have to send you to the hospital

15:52.651 --> 15:53.982
Don't move...

15:54.019 --> 15:55.748
Don't move...

15:55.788 --> 15:57.221
Who stitched up for me?

15:57.323 --> 15:59.257
Who did the operation for me?

15:59.291 --> 16:00.280
Stay calm, don't move!

16:00.326 --> 16:03.056
I am not going to the hospital, no...

16:04.229 --> 16:10.293
My heart is aching
my heart is aching badly

16:10.602 --> 16:11.830
Crab, what's the latest?

16:11.870 --> 16:13.804
Another 100 drug dealers
were just killed

16:13.839 --> 16:14.863
There's only one survivor

16:14.907 --> 16:15.532
How's he now?

16:15.574 --> 16:17.667
His name is Kong
and he is on his way to the hospital

16:18.610 --> 16:19.542
What?

16:20.079 --> 16:21.842
His chest was cut open
and then stitched up again

16:22.381 --> 16:23.746
How come?

16:25.584 --> 16:28.485
Alright, I'm on my way

16:38.864 --> 16:39.922
According to the X-ray

16:39.965 --> 16:41.956
an electronic equipment
has been planted in his heart

16:42.001 --> 16:44.299
It doesn't seem to be a medical device
installed for the patient

16:44.770 --> 16:46.465
It is likely to be a bomb
Such advanced weapon!

16:47.039 --> 16:49.872
The triads are really getting tougher
these days

16:54.046 --> 16:55.206
What are you doing here?

16:55.247 --> 16:56.612
I am looking for lnspector Shek

16:56.648 --> 16:58.616
He's busy

16:58.650 --> 16:59.639
he can't see you

16:59.685 --> 17:00.617
I have a very important message
to give him

17:00.652 --> 17:03.951
No, no one can enter

17:03.989 --> 17:05.888
The area behind this is
completely blocked off

17:08.426 --> 17:11.419
Hurry
The bomb disposal officer has arrived

17:11.463 --> 17:12.452
Get the bomb discharging unit, quick

17:23.976 --> 17:24.964
Cut the wires

17:25.877 --> 17:26.845
Be careful

17:27.279 --> 17:28.940
Pull the ribs open

17:33.519 --> 17:36.010
There is something unidentifiable found
under the left heart chamber

17:36.088 --> 17:37.385
Get ready for disposing the bomb

17:37.523 --> 17:39.047
Get ready for blood vessels connection

17:44.096 --> 17:44.994
Wait

17:45.264 --> 17:46.925
These are not blood vessels
but wires of a bomb

17:46.965 --> 17:49.160
If you touch it even lightly
it'll explode

17:50.335 --> 17:51.802
Doctor, try to speed up his heart beat
hurry up

17:51.837 --> 17:55.295
We are not sure
which is wire and which is vessel

17:55.607 --> 17:56.801
The heart beat of the patient is so weak

17:56.842 --> 17:58.503
Get ready 50cc cardiotonics

17:59.812 --> 18:01.370
How powerful is the bomb?

18:01.513 --> 18:03.708
According to the volume
of the liquidated nitrogen

18:03.749 --> 18:06.183
it can wipe out all of us in this room

18:06.218 --> 18:07.651
All people should retreat

18:09.922 --> 18:11.014
I'll stay behind to dispose the bomb

18:11.056 --> 18:12.421
But if his pulse
and his heart beat changes

18:12.458 --> 18:14.221
you won't know how to save him

18:14.259 --> 18:16.557
let me stay with you

18:17.896 --> 18:19.955
Alright, all of you leave at once

18:19.998 --> 18:21.932
only the three of us will stay

18:25.938 --> 18:28.668
There are 16 wires
interdispersed with the veins

18:28.707 --> 18:30.698
Now I have to pair them off and then
cut them group by group

18:30.742 --> 18:32.073
Detective, please give me a hand

18:32.211 --> 18:33.269
Alright, I'll do it, when to cut?

18:34.880 --> 18:36.245
When I count to three
let's cut it together

18:38.884 --> 18:39.942
One

18:43.489 --> 18:44.649
Two

18:47.326 --> 18:48.452
Three

18:48.494 --> 18:49.392
Detective

18:49.428 --> 18:50.258
What's the matter?

18:50.295 --> 18:51.319
Sir, the Commissioner is on the phone

18:51.363 --> 18:52.455
he wants to talk to you immediately

18:57.169 --> 18:58.830
Commissioner, this is Shek

18:59.304 --> 19:00.635
I am Tsui Chik

19:00.672 --> 19:01.969
How do you find this number?

19:02.007 --> 19:03.975
No time to explain now
are you disposing a bomb?

19:04.009 --> 19:05.636
In the bomb
there are the blue and the red wires

19:05.677 --> 19:06.871
How do you know?

19:06.912 --> 19:09.210
You listen carefully
don't cut the blue wire

19:10.182 --> 19:11.547
I already did

19:11.950 --> 19:12.746
Then, run for your life

19:12.784 --> 19:14.513
But there are still many people here

19:14.553 --> 19:16.783
Leave, right away
The bomb will go off any minute now

19:17.022 --> 19:19.422
Let's evacuate immediately

19:21.727 --> 19:23.251
Leave this place right now! Right now!

19:23.495 --> 19:24.587
Come out!

19:45.117 --> 19:46.379
How do you know I am in the hospital?

19:46.852 --> 19:48.012
How do you know I am disposing a bomb?

19:48.053 --> 19:49.748
Why do you disguise as the
commissioner to call me?

19:49.788 --> 19:53.417
And, why are you so sure about
the red and blue wires of the bomb?

19:53.458 --> 19:55.551
Don't tell me you were tipped off

19:55.594 --> 19:58.222
And don't tell me the phone number...

19:58.263 --> 19:59.662
was found in the telephone directory

19:59.831 --> 20:01.162
Answer me

20:02.701 --> 20:05.602
All the fact I quoted can be found
in the books on this shelf

20:06.672 --> 20:08.435
How about the phone number?

20:08.540 --> 20:10.940
In fact
I didn't call through any special line

20:11.109 --> 20:12.406
I just pretended to be
the Police Commissioner

20:13.078 --> 20:14.568
Your subordinates love kissing asses

20:14.613 --> 20:16.706
when they heard it was the Commissioner
they called me Sir

20:18.350 --> 20:19.612
Ah! Tsui Chik actually...

20:19.651 --> 20:21.448
prefers man

20:21.920 --> 20:24.252
Tracy, I feel sorry for you

20:24.289 --> 20:25.847
A nice beautiful girl like you

20:25.891 --> 20:27.449
losing to the rock

20:30.329 --> 20:32.297
So after all
you do have a sound detective mind

20:32.331 --> 20:34.128
Why don't you come work for me?

20:34.166 --> 20:35.827
Here you have to report
to so many people

20:35.867 --> 20:36.629
isn't it better for you to serve only me?

20:36.668 --> 20:37.532
Alright!

20:37.836 --> 20:39.428
Dark and ugly

20:39.471 --> 20:42.235
how can Tsui Chik choose him instead?

20:42.908 --> 20:43.966
Maybe it's admiration
on the inspector's part

20:44.009 --> 20:45.840
But I am not used to
doing it at your place

20:45.877 --> 20:47.071
Well, then come over
when you get off work here

20:50.182 --> 20:51.274
Are you gay?

20:58.323 --> 21:00.553
Don't get on my nerve

21:00.892 --> 21:02.826
Take it back and study it

21:02.861 --> 21:04.488
I am a karate expert, you know?

21:21.913 --> 21:25.007
RESECTlON NEUROPATHY STYSTEM

21:49.941 --> 21:52.375
NEUROTOM SUCCESS

22:01.353 --> 22:03.014
They will terminate this squad

22:03.055 --> 22:04.920
But they won't let any of us
leave in peace

22:04.956 --> 22:06.446
Alert everyone

22:06.491 --> 22:08.322
ask them to leave as soon as possible

22:08.593 --> 22:10.254
We are trained by them

22:10.295 --> 22:12.126
We are the most skillful killers
in the world

22:12.164 --> 22:14.189
Why do they want to destroy us?

22:14.866 --> 22:18.427
They didn't think of how to control us
when they started this plan

22:18.470 --> 22:21.337
Up till now, they've found that
they can't control us

22:21.373 --> 22:22.465
So they decided to cancel this plan

22:22.507 --> 22:25.943
One more hour is left
If we don't leave now

22:25.977 --> 22:27.171
we will all die

22:27.746 --> 22:28.838
You'd better leave here at once

22:29.781 --> 22:31.408
Say good-bye for me
to all the team members

22:36.488 --> 22:37.614
Where are you going to?

22:37.656 --> 22:39.089
Asia

23:12.290 --> 23:14.781
Sir, King Kau has shown up

23:18.029 --> 23:20.930
King is now the last of the drug lords

23:20.966 --> 23:24.163
he can have full control over the market

23:24.202 --> 23:25.999
Do you think he is the murderer?

23:26.505 --> 23:28.405
One can easily come to that conclusion

24:09.147 --> 24:10.580
Are you that little jerk?

24:10.615 --> 24:11.877
I am not a little jerk

24:12.017 --> 24:13.279
I am lnspector Shek Wai-ho

24:13.318 --> 24:13.750
From the anti-triad

24:13.785 --> 24:14.877
and seriouscrime bureau of
the Royal Hong Kong Police Force

24:14.920 --> 24:18.913
Are you putting me on?

24:18.957 --> 24:20.151
Follow me

24:33.772 --> 24:36.263
Get lost, who do you think you are?

25:13.812 --> 25:16.440
I've received many presents this day

25:16.781 --> 25:18.214
This is...

25:19.284 --> 25:20.945
my daughter's leg

25:23.722 --> 25:24.689
Follow me!

25:25.590 --> 25:26.818
Check around

25:36.935 --> 25:39.927
All these plastic bags are for me

25:43.575 --> 25:45.304
In this...

25:45.877 --> 25:47.367
This is the dead body of my dad

25:47.712 --> 25:49.907
This is my mom

25:49.948 --> 25:51.779
This is my God-brother

25:52.250 --> 25:53.581
My whole family is here

25:53.652 --> 25:55.745
Another plastic bag is for me

25:56.421 --> 25:57.615
But I threw it away

25:59.624 --> 26:01.285
Why do you waste it?

26:03.261 --> 26:04.956
Doesn't it fit your size?

26:09.634 --> 26:11.261
I want protection

26:15.240 --> 26:16.571
You?

26:18.610 --> 26:19.907
Are you pulling off a stunt?

26:19.945 --> 26:21.810
Why do you want protection?

26:23.481 --> 26:25.642
Tell me, who is after you?

26:26.851 --> 26:28.716
I have no idea

26:31.122 --> 26:32.248
lnspector

26:34.292 --> 26:35.020
take a look!

26:35.293 --> 26:36.157
Set her free

26:36.361 --> 26:37.191
Yes

26:38.930 --> 26:40.591
It is she who told me to hang her up

26:41.666 --> 26:44.567
Miss, is King Kau telling the truth?

26:47.105 --> 26:49.073
Yes

26:56.281 --> 26:58.875
Whose phone is ringing? Not mine

26:58.917 --> 27:00.817
Yours?

27:04.756 --> 27:06.189
Who has left the mobile phone here?

27:12.397 --> 27:14.297
You follow me. The rest just stay behind

27:14.633 --> 27:16.362
Master Kau, please stay here
This place is safer

27:17.902 --> 27:20.166
Be very careful
It may be a set up. Yes

27:26.845 --> 27:28.870
Who wants to pick on me?
Come out... Hurry up!

27:37.022 --> 27:39.047
lnspector, they are armed

27:39.090 --> 27:40.148
Should we arrest them?

27:40.191 --> 27:41.089
Wait

28:04.949 --> 28:06.109
No, the wire is on fire

28:09.154 --> 28:10.086
The main switch!

28:10.588 --> 28:12.021
Get lost, don't stand there like a log

28:35.680 --> 28:36.510
Is it earthquake?

28:36.548 --> 28:38.243
Never, not in Hong Kong

28:46.725 --> 28:48.158
Sir... I can't move!

28:50.228 --> 28:50.990
Don't panic! Hurry up

28:51.029 --> 28:51.586
lnspector. Try hard

28:51.629 --> 28:52.618
Try hard!

28:54.899 --> 28:55.797
That was close!

29:02.540 --> 29:03.507
No one is inside the car

29:03.541 --> 29:04.599
I am going to take a look

29:07.212 --> 29:08.941
lnspector, be careful

29:10.014 --> 29:11.072
Where is the wheel?

29:14.285 --> 29:15.411
How to stop then?

29:19.958 --> 29:21.550
Ask them not to shoot!
lnspector Shek is up there!

29:21.593 --> 29:23.686
Drop the gun! Police!

29:23.728 --> 29:25.355
The police, so what!

29:25.396 --> 29:26.454
Shoot him!

29:33.004 --> 29:34.028
Are you scared?

29:34.873 --> 29:36.101
Don't panic, I am here with you

29:38.076 --> 29:39.805
Isn't it exciting?

29:42.313 --> 29:43.746
I haven't tried that before

29:43.782 --> 29:45.044
Don't waste it

30:28.827 --> 30:30.226
Are you kidding?

34:20.824 --> 34:22.224
Yuek-lan?!

34:34.705 --> 34:36.195
Sir

34:40.378 --> 34:42.072
Mission failed, let's retreat now

35:21.385 --> 35:23.080
So smart looking!

35:23.121 --> 35:26.249
I've just seen you wearing a mask
sure looks like Batman

35:56.621 --> 35:58.589
Thank you Sir

35:59.257 --> 36:02.693
When there is real action
I can't protect you anymore

36:02.727 --> 36:03.716
You must remember

36:08.633 --> 36:10.328
How is King Kau?

36:10.368 --> 36:13.360
Not good. He is in intensive care

36:13.404 --> 36:15.031
I've assigned four teams
of police to protect him 24 hrs

36:16.207 --> 36:18.903
I hope we can get good information
from him when he wakes up

36:20.978 --> 36:22.206
lnspector Shek

36:22.246 --> 36:26.080
there were many people inside
So I've kept quiet

36:26.117 --> 36:28.608
What the hell are you doing?

36:29.520 --> 36:31.488
Want to play hero?

36:32.089 --> 36:35.889
Why did you mask yourself and dress
in black when you were working?

36:36.460 --> 36:38.951
Even the SDU questioned me

36:38.996 --> 36:40.861
They said we have a cute new uniform

36:41.933 --> 36:44.197
Commissioner...

36:44.535 --> 36:46.469
I can stand misjudgment in others

36:46.604 --> 36:47.730
Commissioner

36:48.739 --> 36:52.766
If you really think I am the man
who put on a mask last night

36:53.010 --> 36:54.034
be frank

36:54.078 --> 36:55.978
I started to suspect your judgement

36:57.114 --> 36:58.411
Look at me, look at my eyes

36:58.649 --> 37:01.618
Do I seem like the kind of guy
who puts on a mask and mess about?

37:02.687 --> 37:04.552
Of course, you do

37:04.889 --> 37:06.117
Here is your coffee

37:06.157 --> 37:07.089
'Black Mask'!

37:07.491 --> 37:09.356
Sorry, I can't help it

37:12.930 --> 37:16.058
Listen, I don't want to repeat myself

37:16.400 --> 37:18.459
The police force is a disciplinary force

37:18.502 --> 37:20.197
Now I warn you seriously

37:20.238 --> 37:24.174
You can't wear such weird costume
during office hour just to show off yourself

37:24.575 --> 37:25.599
Understand?

37:26.777 --> 37:28.005
Can I wear it when I am off duty?

37:28.045 --> 37:30.445
No way

37:30.481 --> 37:31.607
have you made yourself clear?

37:31.983 --> 37:32.915
Yes, sir

37:34.285 --> 37:35.411
lnspector Shek
somebody is looking for you!

37:35.953 --> 37:37.147
There's nothing I can do

37:37.188 --> 37:38.951
Can you help me to prove that
I am not the 'Black Mask'?

37:38.990 --> 37:40.116
What is the 'Black Mask'?

37:40.157 --> 37:42.557
This is your watch

37:42.593 --> 37:44.117
Oh, you've got it

37:44.161 --> 37:46.823
I've searched for a week

37:48.666 --> 37:51.635
Losing a watch is no big deal

37:52.870 --> 37:54.269
but it's much harder

37:54.305 --> 37:56.569
to find a missing person

37:57.208 --> 37:59.073
I had a student, once

37:59.410 --> 38:02.379
She suddenly disappeared and
I haven't heard from her since

38:02.413 --> 38:04.347
But we just made contact again
She called me yesterday

38:04.382 --> 38:05.440
So?

38:06.117 --> 38:08.210
She said she was locked up by the police

38:09.353 --> 38:11.583
Can you do me a favor?

38:14.325 --> 38:15.622
Your teacher is here for you

38:15.660 --> 38:18.390
Your teacher looks very young

38:46.424 --> 38:48.654
Sir, we have been looking for you

38:48.826 --> 38:50.259
I can't imagine that
you've come to Hong Kong

38:50.294 --> 38:52.489
Are you working for the police?

38:52.863 --> 38:54.228
No

38:54.598 --> 38:56.122
I am just helping my friend

38:56.701 --> 38:57.793
Friend?

38:58.235 --> 39:02.228
This is the reason that made you pick on
your old team mates?

39:02.506 --> 39:03.200
Yes

39:03.407 --> 39:05.136
I don't want to see
so many people sacrificing

39:05.276 --> 39:07.471
Have you noticed the kids inside?

39:07.511 --> 39:09.308
They all have smiling faces

39:10.348 --> 39:12.873
I do envy them

39:13.117 --> 39:14.948
Who is your boss?

39:14.985 --> 39:16.543
Take me to him

39:16.721 --> 39:20.282
Sir, it's you
who encouraged me to be a warrior

39:20.324 --> 39:22.383
Now, you asked me to be
an ordinary people

39:28.432 --> 39:29.694
How dare you court my boss's girl?

39:29.834 --> 39:31.825
We can never be ordinary people again

39:31.869 --> 39:32.858
You don't want to live?

40:16.714 --> 40:18.477
You bump my nose!

40:18.516 --> 40:20.780
Listen, he is my friend

40:20.818 --> 40:23.810
From now on
I'll hold you responsible if he is hurt

40:24.288 --> 40:25.346
Get lost

40:26.023 --> 40:26.921
Stop nagging

40:26.957 --> 40:29.187
I think you'd better move in with me

40:29.226 --> 40:30.454
No

40:33.464 --> 40:34.431
Why?

40:34.465 --> 40:36.330
Violence against violence
isn't a good way to beat crimes

40:36.367 --> 40:37.959
It will only make the world more messy

40:38.002 --> 40:40.300
I guess I'll have to give you
a good beating up before you'll get it

40:41.305 --> 40:43.466
See, now you want to beat
even your friend!

40:43.541 --> 40:45.133
I just want to teach you how to be smart

40:46.210 --> 40:48.110
You don't need to beat me
to teach me to be smart

40:48.145 --> 40:50.079
I am not planning to
I am just raising my voice

40:50.114 --> 40:51.376
Why did you shout?

40:51.415 --> 40:53.406
You are so far away from me
how can you hear me?

40:54.218 --> 40:55.617
Bastard, if I catch you
I will beat you to death

40:55.653 --> 40:58.087
No, please don't!

41:02.660 --> 41:05.959
The fifth to ninth segment of the
vertebral column are all smashed

41:06.263 --> 41:09.232
General, you are seriously hurt

41:09.266 --> 41:10.961
I have to deplete your blood

41:25.916 --> 41:28.146
Commander, don't abandon me

41:28.185 --> 41:29.914
This will make you feel better

41:31.989 --> 41:35.720
I help him to deplete his blood
his heart will fail as a result

41:35.759 --> 41:39.286
But at least
he will die more comfortably

41:40.531 --> 41:41.896
Put me through to Columbia

41:44.068 --> 41:45.194
Commander, it's connected

41:45.870 --> 41:48.270
Mission completed

41:48.305 --> 41:50.000
Our motive has been reached

41:50.641 --> 41:52.871
Ask them to deposit the second payment
to our bank account

41:55.513 --> 41:57.208
They said now that
we have killed all the drug dealers

41:57.248 --> 41:58.510
no one deals with them anymore

41:58.549 --> 42:02.508
The police's files are more important
than the drug dealers

42:02.553 --> 42:04.748
If no one deals with them

42:04.889 --> 42:07.414
we can

42:07.458 --> 42:10.689
We can take over
the whole SE Asia market

42:12.897 --> 42:15.491
They said, if we don't follow
their instructions, they won't pay us

42:15.900 --> 42:18.801
Don't worry, people from Spain
Brazil and America

42:18.836 --> 42:20.303
want to work with us

42:20.337 --> 42:21.895
We have plenty of dealers to choose from

42:22.706 --> 42:25.334
Tell him, we are raising the price
three times higher

42:28.546 --> 42:29.740
He is considering the proposal

42:30.381 --> 42:32.645
You cunning old fox!

42:32.683 --> 42:34.844
You don't have much time left

42:34.885 --> 42:36.546
Still considering?

42:36.921 --> 42:41.756
Do you know who the masked guy is?

42:42.159 --> 42:43.524
He's our coach

42:44.094 --> 42:44.992
He wants to see you

42:45.529 --> 42:46.587
Great

42:46.997 --> 42:48.828
If he is willing to join us,

42:48.866 --> 42:53.235
our mission could be finished
a lot faster

42:53.604 --> 42:55.595
What if he rejects our offer to join us?

42:55.773 --> 42:57.104
He won't reject

42:57.141 --> 42:58.836
Because he is just like us

42:58.876 --> 43:01.538
having escaped from a failed experiment

43:01.712 --> 43:03.646
Only I can save him

43:04.181 --> 43:05.546
He will come back

43:11.589 --> 43:13.284
I have considered seriously
I decided to resign

43:13.324 --> 43:15.690
701 has appeared in Hong Kong

43:15.726 --> 43:17.455
I'll have to face it myself

43:21.765 --> 43:22.629
This is Tracy

43:22.666 --> 43:24.691
I am in the library. Come and save me!

43:57.401 --> 44:04.898
Happy birthday to you...

44:04.942 --> 44:12.747
Happy birthday to Tsui Chik
happy birthday to you!

44:13.083 --> 44:15.108
Cut the birthday cake now

44:15.519 --> 44:16.611
Make a wish

44:16.654 --> 44:18.713
We found the date of birth
on your resume! Are we smart or what?

44:18.756 --> 44:20.781
How pathetic!

44:24.094 --> 44:25.356
Pathetic?

44:29.333 --> 44:30.527
This is my resignation letter

44:30.701 --> 44:33.192
Hey, take it easy! Please don't resign!

44:33.237 --> 44:34.101
Don't resign!

44:34.138 --> 44:35.264
I don't get the humour in this at all

44:38.342 --> 44:40.776
Are you leaving? Just Kidding

44:41.478 --> 44:43.378
Come back... So stingy

44:43.714 --> 44:48.378
Tsui Chik...

44:51.122 --> 44:52.817
To be my friend will involve risks

44:53.191 --> 44:55.182
They are not suitable for that

44:56.528 --> 44:58.393
Detective Shek may be qualified

44:58.930 --> 45:00.761
At least, he can protect himself

45:08.573 --> 45:12.634
Tsui Chik

45:12.811 --> 45:14.369
Wait! Tsui Chik!

45:15.080 --> 45:16.172
Wait!

45:18.717 --> 45:20.981
Loosen up! Why do you want to resign?

45:21.019 --> 45:22.577
I have my own reason to resign!

45:26.057 --> 45:27.217
This is for you

45:27.492 --> 45:28.720
Happy birthday!

45:30.862 --> 45:31.794
Thank you

45:32.564 --> 45:35.260
It's late! It's hard for you to get a taxi
Let me give you a ride, OK?

45:35.300 --> 45:36.062
No, thanks

45:36.701 --> 45:40.467
I won't take advantage of you, you know?
By the way...

45:40.505 --> 45:41.472
Get in, I'll drive

45:43.041 --> 45:43.939
What's wrong? Get in now!

46:02.093 --> 46:04.186
Hi, long time no see!

46:04.629 --> 46:06.392
What's that?!

46:06.431 --> 46:07.489
Look that way!

46:11.803 --> 46:13.737
Doctor. You've finally shown up

46:13.772 --> 46:16.002
I hope you won't go against
the Hong Kong police

46:16.041 --> 46:18.236
If you do, I'll interfere

46:18.376 --> 46:21.140
Today
I want to tell you a story about pigs

46:21.179 --> 46:23.272
There were these pigs
they were transformed into human beings

46:23.315 --> 46:27.411
Then they were sent back to the farm
and were made to live with other pigs

46:27.819 --> 46:31.550
Then they realized that
the pigs were stupid and stinky

46:31.823 --> 46:33.723
And they discriminated against the pigs

46:33.959 --> 46:36.553
However, they couldn't turn back again

46:36.595 --> 46:38.529
so they threatened the pigs

46:38.563 --> 46:41.589
and made them kill each other

46:41.766 --> 46:44.360
The professor has not only
destroyed your nerves

46:44.569 --> 46:46.560
he has also destroyed your brain

46:46.605 --> 46:48.664
You are nuts

46:48.707 --> 46:50.174
Am I nuts?

46:50.575 --> 46:53.203
Pigs are destined to be killed
by human beings

46:53.244 --> 46:54.506
We need not show pity on them

46:54.546 --> 46:56.070
But they are human beings, not pigs

46:57.882 --> 47:01.784
You are a shame and you are helpless

47:01.820 --> 47:03.219
Move!

47:04.255 --> 47:06.519
Even if there is an antidote

47:06.558 --> 47:08.856
I will never give it to you

47:09.260 --> 47:10.591
But...

47:14.666 --> 47:16.634
I don't think you can wait till that day

48:23.268 --> 48:24.599
Who are you?

48:27.939 --> 48:28.997
Help!

49:47.385 --> 49:48.852
Who are you?

49:49.587 --> 49:51.179
Don't come over!

49:51.456 --> 49:52.423
I will bite!

49:52.457 --> 49:53.549
I am going to call the police

49:56.628 --> 49:58.027
Help! What do you want?

49:58.163 --> 50:00.859
I'll ask my family to post you the money
Don't harm me!

50:04.068 --> 50:05.296
It hurts!

50:07.472 --> 50:09.497
I have AlDS, don't rape me

50:12.510 --> 50:14.034
Your wound is so deep

50:14.646 --> 50:15.908
This is antiphlogistic

50:28.193 --> 50:30.991
Don't wander off
You are in very dangerous situation

50:34.566 --> 50:37.364
If you are bored
play with the TV game set

50:38.169 --> 50:39.227
If you are hungry

50:41.539 --> 50:42.699
call me

50:50.181 --> 50:51.910
I want to piss badly

50:52.750 --> 50:54.911
I almost wet my pants!

51:59.217 --> 52:02.482
I am getting pressure
from the Yankees (cops)

52:02.654 --> 52:07.250
They're calling everyday to check
whether we have found any clues

52:07.292 --> 52:08.589
I have sent my best guys
to investigate the case

52:08.626 --> 52:09.957
I am sure we can get something
in the next two days

52:09.994 --> 52:12.554
Since the event occurred in Hong Kong

52:12.730 --> 52:15.028
this should be handled
by Hong Kong police

52:15.233 --> 52:16.427
Americans shouldn't stick
their nose in this

52:16.801 --> 52:19.269
But King Kau is the only drugs
dealer left in Hong Kong

52:19.304 --> 52:20.771
He is still in intensive care

52:21.072 --> 52:24.337
If he dies, we would have lost our
only link to information

52:24.542 --> 52:27.602
Among the victims
there were undercovers

52:27.645 --> 52:30.978
I think it must be
the foreign drug dealers..

52:31.015 --> 52:32.846
trying to evade Hong Kong markets

52:33.184 --> 52:36.517
Our only hope is to establish contact
with the US network

52:36.554 --> 52:38.522
So we can get the information
of the US drugs dealers

52:38.556 --> 52:40.251
And then solve the case

52:45.964 --> 52:48.057
Connection established
download process activated

53:00.979 --> 53:02.844
Report, duplication completed

53:02.880 --> 53:04.279
'he security system of the Hong Kong Police's compute

53:04.315 --> 53:05.942
must be the worst in the world

53:05.984 --> 53:09.943
They will never anticipate that
we will plot to steal their computer information

53:10.488 --> 53:13.116
Keep on interrupting
the Police's attention

53:13.825 --> 53:18.592
Sell the list of the US DEA undercover
agents to the Columbians

53:18.730 --> 53:21.699
Detective Shek will protect King Kau

53:21.733 --> 53:24.463
Use Shek as a bait to get our coach

53:24.602 --> 53:26.866
Yuek-lan
you're responsible for this mission

53:29.107 --> 53:31.905
take charge!

53:31.943 --> 53:35.208
For those who don't want to compromise

53:36.347 --> 53:38.178
there is only one solution

53:50.061 --> 53:53.428
I'm hungry

53:57.368 --> 53:58.596
Eat

54:11.983 --> 54:13.780
It's awful. What's this?

54:13.818 --> 54:15.843
Preserved duck on rice

54:15.887 --> 54:17.286
Have you ever cooked a meal?

54:33.571 --> 54:36.665
Forget it

54:50.321 --> 54:53.154
Here's the special news

54:53.191 --> 54:55.887
A mysterious man in all black recently
appears in Hong Kong

54:55.927 --> 54:58.828
What do the citizens
think about this man in black?

54:58.863 --> 55:01.991
Is he a big popular singing star
disguised in black?

55:02.033 --> 55:03.500
Where can I buy a photo of him?

55:03.801 --> 55:05.200
This man is really weird

55:05.236 --> 55:08.103
Why does he dress in black all the time?

55:08.139 --> 55:09.401
Why does he wear a mask?

55:09.440 --> 55:10.930
Is it to hide his ugly face?

55:10.975 --> 55:12.033
Thanks

55:12.443 --> 55:14.877
Next
let's hear some professional opinions

55:14.912 --> 55:17.039
In fact

55:17.081 --> 55:20.209
this hero is the psychological reflection
of people's consciousness

55:20.251 --> 55:23.186
Since we are exposed to
so many unfair things in life

55:23.221 --> 55:25.712
we are always looking for a hero
who make sure that justice is done

55:25.756 --> 55:27.815
I think this is an illusion

55:28.292 --> 55:29.088
Thank you!

55:29.360 --> 55:32.488
Now, the police can't get any information
about the 'Black Mask'

55:32.530 --> 55:34.498
But the Commissioner has ordered a sanction

55:34.532 --> 55:35.829
among all the film production companies

55:35.867 --> 55:38.062
they can't use it as a movie script

55:39.137 --> 55:40.297
Now, you are famous

55:40.338 --> 55:42.966
will you throw a concert later?

55:43.007 --> 55:44.599
Let me be your agent

55:46.144 --> 55:48.112
You don't need to live here anymore

55:49.247 --> 55:50.441
It's too lonely

55:50.781 --> 55:52.078
You women

55:52.116 --> 55:54.584
are so snobbish, how vain!

55:54.619 --> 55:57.281
What do you mean? You masked yourself
aren't you vain as well?

55:57.321 --> 56:00.813
Women wearing make up is as vain as
a man wearing a mask

56:00.858 --> 56:02.951
I don't wear make up!

56:02.994 --> 56:04.154
Really?

56:04.529 --> 56:05.757
I wanna give you a gift

56:06.931 --> 56:08.489
Thank you!

56:09.200 --> 56:10.224
Sorry.

56:20.311 --> 56:21.539
Tsui Chik?

56:26.851 --> 56:28.250
Tsui Chik?

56:37.528 --> 56:40.429
I was lucky to be saved by you
but how about Tsui Chik?

56:40.464 --> 56:43.331
Will Tsui Chik die?

56:43.768 --> 56:45.429
Is he important to you?

56:45.469 --> 56:47.061
Not exactly, but...

56:47.104 --> 56:49.800
he is pretty helpless
he can't even take care of himself

56:50.274 --> 56:52.799
Please help me to find him, OK?

56:52.910 --> 56:54.400
OK, I promise

56:55.513 --> 56:59.381
You know
men who always claim how good they are

56:59.417 --> 57:00.543
can't be all that good

57:00.585 --> 57:02.746
Those who has real substance
rarely utter a word

57:17.368 --> 57:18.665
This is Tsui Chik

57:18.703 --> 57:21.797
Hi, it's you! I worry about you!

57:21.839 --> 57:24.137
Now, I am in a very secure place

57:24.175 --> 57:27.110
I have been kidnapped

57:27.144 --> 57:29.169
But I don't know where I am now

57:29.213 --> 57:31.579
Everyday, I hear only 'Bang Bang Bang'

57:31.616 --> 57:33.607
I think this may be an industrial area

57:33.651 --> 57:36.051
And I hear the sound of planes

57:36.087 --> 57:38.715
I think I may be near the airport

57:38.756 --> 57:41.350
Also, this place is facing West

57:41.392 --> 57:43.553
During sunset, we get the sun

57:43.728 --> 57:44.888
Come and save me!

57:44.929 --> 57:46.294
If you can't

57:46.330 --> 57:49.766
go to seek help from your friend
lnspector Shek

57:49.900 --> 57:51.060
Is that clear?

57:51.102 --> 57:53.366
Alright, I'll think of something

57:53.404 --> 57:56.862
Remember, don't do anything silly
Black Mask'll protect you!

57:56.907 --> 57:58.772
OK. Bye bye!

58:07.118 --> 58:09.951
Tsui Chik that nerd!
Please, be smart and save me

58:10.221 --> 58:12.348
Or I will die

58:16.961 --> 58:18.223
How come?

58:18.829 --> 58:20.524
lnspector, our computer is infected

58:20.564 --> 58:22.725
I know it, same as mine

58:28.339 --> 58:30.705
lnspector, your friend Tsui Chik is here
looking for you

58:39.083 --> 58:40.607
There were many people killed
in the library

58:40.951 --> 58:42.111
None of my business

58:42.420 --> 58:44.012
How is Tracy now?

58:44.522 --> 58:46.683
Don't worry, she is fine

58:48.125 --> 58:50.616
You are as mysterious as the 'Black Mask'
appearing and disappearing just like that

58:50.761 --> 58:52.353
Why don't you disguise as him?

58:52.563 --> 58:55.293
So others won't mistake
me as the 'Black Mask'

58:56.000 --> 58:58.525
When I knew you, you told me that

58:58.736 --> 59:00.795
if you want to be a good friend
with a person

59:00.971 --> 59:03.132
try not to know
too much secret about him

59:03.507 --> 59:06.101
If you know too much
you can't be friends any more

59:06.377 --> 59:08.242
It's not too late to understand that
philosophy now

59:12.550 --> 59:13.642
When he takes off his mask

59:13.684 --> 59:16.778
will I find my father?

59:18.089 --> 59:19.556
Are you going to the hospital?

59:20.424 --> 59:23.188
They're using you as a bait to get
the Black Mask!

59:23.494 --> 59:25.257
You're no match for them!

59:26.731 --> 59:27.823
You know

59:28.199 --> 59:31.259
everyday at this hour
I love standing here to watch the sunset

59:31.635 --> 59:33.796
And I'll tell myself that

59:34.038 --> 59:36.199
I can still stand on the same place
the following day

59:37.675 --> 59:39.643
Tonight, I have to fight a tough battle

59:39.977 --> 59:42.343
I don't know whether 'Black Mask'
is my friend or my enemy

59:44.749 --> 59:47.377
I hope he won't appear

59:48.052 --> 59:49.178
If you have time
come play chess with me tomorrow

59:49.220 --> 59:51.415
Sure I will

01:00:04.402 --> 01:00:06.063
You've never counter attacked before..

01:00:06.103 --> 01:00:07.400
why this time?

01:00:07.438 --> 01:00:10.601
Because I don't think
I need to hide anything anymore

01:00:10.641 --> 01:00:13.166
I'm a cop, I can arrest you

01:00:13.210 --> 01:00:15.178
I come to you...

01:00:15.212 --> 01:00:16.839
not because you're a cop

01:00:17.648 --> 01:00:19.206
Cause you're my friend

01:00:37.535 --> 01:00:38.524
What's the matter?

01:00:43.607 --> 01:00:45.802
SDU calling UP
what's happening downstairs?

01:00:46.243 --> 01:00:47.073
What's happened?

01:00:47.678 --> 01:00:48.940
A guy was hurt in an accident

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:51.675
He needs immediate operation

01:00:52.516 --> 01:00:54.746
Control...

01:00:54.785 --> 01:00:57.913
a patient who was injured in an industrial
accident is being sent to the hospital

01:00:57.955 --> 01:01:00.082
UP, gate!

01:01:01.058 --> 01:01:03.083
Let him pass
Let them move to the casualties

01:01:03.394 --> 01:01:04.019
Roger

01:01:04.562 --> 01:01:06.962
SDU control centre calling

01:01:07.131 --> 01:01:08.996
Nothing happened downstairs

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:12.164
Everyone in position
keep on standing by

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:29.117
How is the situation?

01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:30.887
He has just been given sedative

01:01:46.203 --> 01:01:48.068
Don't come over. Are you a ghost?

01:01:48.472 --> 01:01:49.939
No... Don't come over!

01:02:43.661 --> 01:02:44.389
Don't move

01:02:45.162 --> 01:02:46.857
I've given you anesthetics
You aren't going anywhere

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:07.739
You can't escape

01:03:21.932 --> 01:03:23.490
Stop shooting! He's got no bullets

01:03:30.541 --> 01:03:32.372
Stand by...

01:03:33.043 --> 01:03:35.807
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

01:03:36.747 --> 01:03:38.339
Don't worry

01:03:38.382 --> 01:03:40.043
we won't hurt you

01:03:40.351 --> 01:03:41.909
Give me the gun

01:03:46.957 --> 01:03:48.117
Stay calm

01:03:50.628 --> 01:03:51.993
Don't panic

01:03:54.398 --> 01:03:57.196
How is it? A colleague is on fire
put out the fire now!

01:04:27.131 --> 01:04:28.655
Go... go

01:04:28.899 --> 01:04:30.799
Two by two... cover formation

01:04:40.744 --> 01:04:41.711
Many colleagues of team one died

01:04:41.879 --> 01:04:42.504
Team one reform

01:04:42.546 --> 01:04:44.776
Join team two. Team three cover them

01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:23.343
Didn't you say the Black Mask
won't show up?

01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:25.575
Black Mask didn't make that promise

01:07:04.588 --> 01:07:05.919
lnspector...

01:07:07.457 --> 01:07:09.652
Don't come over here
There are bombs on his body

01:07:14.932 --> 01:07:15.921
Damn it!

01:07:21.939 --> 01:07:22.530
lnspector

01:07:22.573 --> 01:07:23.835
lnspector, are you hurt?

01:07:24.041 --> 01:07:25.338
Sir...

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:26.501
Are you alright?

01:07:26.543 --> 01:07:27.475
How are you? Are you alright?

01:07:27.511 --> 01:07:30.173
lnspector, look!

01:07:34.785 --> 01:07:36.275
lnspector, where are you going?

01:07:37.454 --> 01:07:38.921
I am going to buy a pack of cigarettes

01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:40.879
Take the evidence back

01:08:04.648 --> 01:08:06.275
Yeuk-lan...

01:08:06.917 --> 01:08:08.214
Yeuk-lan

01:08:11.188 --> 01:08:12.746
You saved me again

01:08:16.326 --> 01:08:17.452
But you are blocking me

01:08:27.904 --> 01:08:29.133
You helped me once

01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:31.738
I helped you too

01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:34.399
You will never get what you want

01:08:34.645 --> 01:08:37.170
Follow me back to our place
Commander Hung will cure you

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:38.978
I won't go back

01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:40.542
I don't want to be killer again

01:08:40.751 --> 01:08:43.447
You know?
I can't even feel like an ordinary people

01:08:43.787 --> 01:08:48.019
Soon, we will be able to have a new life

01:08:48.158 --> 01:08:52.322
We have come to steal information from
the anti-narcotics bureau of the HK police

01:08:52.662 --> 01:08:55.529
So we can make a large sum of money

01:08:55.832 --> 01:08:58.630
Then we can afford to cure ourselves

01:08:58.769 --> 01:09:00.669
Your target isn't Hong Kong Police

01:09:00.871 --> 01:09:02.202
But the international drugs dealing gangs

01:09:03.473 --> 01:09:06.465
We sell information to
the King of drugs & control the whole market

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:08.669
You are cold-blooded
why do you want to cure yourself?

01:09:08.712 --> 01:09:10.612
You can never do that

01:09:10.747 --> 01:09:13.180
You are bleeding very badly
if it doesn't stop, you'll die

01:09:13.216 --> 01:09:16.379
Better follow me, sir

01:09:17.354 --> 01:09:19.082
I'd rather die...

01:09:19.221 --> 01:09:21.019
than follow you back

01:09:21.158 --> 01:09:22.625
I must stop you

01:09:25.095 --> 01:09:26.426
Wait for me!

01:09:45.782 --> 01:09:47.943
Help...

01:09:52.823 --> 01:09:53.846
What's up?

01:09:54.658 --> 01:09:55.590
How are you?

01:09:59.963 --> 01:10:01.988
Leave now

01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:04.790
Someone wants to kill me

01:10:05.068 --> 01:10:07.434
it is dangerous and
I can't protect you any further

01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:09.035
Danger!

01:10:09.172 --> 01:10:10.503
Go!

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:35.656
My God, this is so high!

01:10:36.133 --> 01:10:38.124
How to jump?

01:11:43.533 --> 01:11:45.125
Don't come over. I am an ace shooter

01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:21.435
Come on!

01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:26.172
Hold me tight!

01:13:01.545 --> 01:13:04.070
Yeuk-lan, did you get Black Mask?

01:13:05.849 --> 01:13:07.874
Commander, he ran away

01:13:17.661 --> 01:13:18.719
Yeuk-lan

01:13:21.464 --> 01:13:22.158
Go!

01:14:19.856 --> 01:14:22.723
Don't move, you bleed a lot

01:14:22.892 --> 01:14:24.519
You need to take a good rest

01:14:43.813 --> 01:14:47.078
If you see my face, it will put you
in a more dangerous position

01:14:47.617 --> 01:14:49.141
Well, I won't insist then

01:14:49.185 --> 01:14:51.676
After your recovery
I'm sure you will show me voluntarily

01:15:39.869 --> 01:15:41.564
Do you really want to help me?

01:15:41.604 --> 01:15:42.696
Yes...

01:15:43.473 --> 01:15:46.499
Get ready
We have a lot of things to do.

01:15:50.847 --> 01:15:52.371
It's time to put an end here

01:15:53.416 --> 01:15:56.544
Kuen, Shi, Ho

01:15:56.886 --> 01:15:58.615
I can't imagine that you could only live
such short lives!

01:16:15.805 --> 01:16:18.137
I know you would come

01:16:18.508 --> 01:16:20.373
It's useless for you to arrest
all these people

01:16:20.610 --> 01:16:23.044
The only way to stop them

01:16:23.079 --> 01:16:24.979
is to ruin their plan

01:16:25.382 --> 01:16:27.043
Ruin their plan?

01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:29.011
But they killed all the drugs dealers

01:16:29.052 --> 01:16:30.917
Will they kill the governor next?

01:16:30.954 --> 01:16:35.948
They're accessing the police
computer network to steal information

01:16:39.162 --> 01:16:40.925
The bodies buried here...

01:16:40.964 --> 01:16:43.228
are police sacrificed in the hospital

01:16:44.968 --> 01:16:46.868
Police do die on duty

01:16:46.903 --> 01:16:48.962
We shouldn't blame a word

01:16:49.806 --> 01:16:52.832
But you know? I almost caught her

01:16:53.009 --> 01:16:54.840
I almost got her!

01:16:55.712 --> 01:16:57.771
Because of you, she was saved!

01:16:57.914 --> 01:17:00.508
They have died for nothing

01:17:04.154 --> 01:17:05.712
Take this

01:17:05.855 --> 01:17:07.914
And put it into your computer

01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:09.481
When they begin stealing
police information

01:17:09.526 --> 01:17:12.427
the virus will enter their system

01:17:15.398 --> 01:17:16.490
Thank you for saving my life

01:17:16.533 --> 01:17:17.830
But I don't want to owe you anymore

01:17:18.134 --> 01:17:21.228
Even if I die in front of you
I don't want you to save me

01:17:21.271 --> 01:17:23.330
If you have a good way of handling them

01:17:23.473 --> 01:17:25.065
I promise I won't bother

01:17:25.108 --> 01:17:26.166
This is duty of the police

01:18:30.273 --> 01:18:33.401
You can't even beat me
how can you take on 701?

01:18:40.884 --> 01:18:42.146
I'll give it my lost shot

01:18:48.825 --> 01:18:50.122
Stop your work

01:18:52.028 --> 01:18:53.461
Put this disc into the computer

01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:55.889
lnspector, without the order of
the Commissioner, we can't do that

01:18:57.767 --> 01:18:59.564
Please

01:19:09.946 --> 01:19:11.379
The computer is being infected

01:19:11.614 --> 01:19:13.775
Report
the computer virus is invading...

01:19:16.286 --> 01:19:17.253
Take the disc out

01:19:17.353 --> 01:19:18.479
or it'll completely erase the information
we have already got

01:19:18.521 --> 01:19:19.647
Give way!

01:19:23.226 --> 01:19:25.057
lnspector, are you crazy?

01:19:25.094 --> 01:19:26.618
It's a serious crime to use guns
without the proper license

01:19:26.663 --> 01:19:27.891
Drop the gun

01:19:28.031 --> 01:19:30.022
I know it's against the rules

01:19:30.066 --> 01:19:32.330
But I didn't have enough time
to report to you

01:19:32.735 --> 01:19:34.896
Some criminals are stealing information
from our computer

01:19:34.938 --> 01:19:36.496
I just want to damage
their computer system

01:19:36.539 --> 01:19:40.134
Bull shit! We police have a tight
security against any stealing

01:19:40.176 --> 01:19:43.441
Any information obtained without our
proper approval will become useless data

01:19:43.479 --> 01:19:46.141
I order you to drop the gun. Now!

01:19:54.424 --> 01:19:55.914
Stay calm, lnspector

01:19:55.959 --> 01:19:57.654
I just want to solve the case

01:19:57.827 --> 01:19:59.692
We can discuss this

01:19:59.729 --> 01:20:02.357
We can't. We haven't got time

01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:08.897
I forgot to load the gun

01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:14.432
lnspector
you are off this case as of this minute

01:20:14.777 --> 01:20:16.768
You are suspended

01:20:17.046 --> 01:20:19.446
Now, go out and write me a report

01:20:22.585 --> 01:20:23.609
Take the disc out

01:20:23.653 --> 01:20:24.642
Yes sir

01:20:28.791 --> 01:20:30.452
Transmission back to normal

01:20:30.493 --> 01:20:31.255
Transmission go on

01:20:31.294 --> 01:20:32.283
Go on

01:20:38.968 --> 01:20:40.401
How is it?

01:20:41.838 --> 01:20:42.862
No reaction

01:21:06.462 --> 01:21:09.556
Bull shit! We police have tight
security against any espionage

01:21:09.599 --> 01:21:12.966
Any information obtained without our
proper approval will become useless data

01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:19.072
Unless they are inside
the police station

01:21:23.046 --> 01:21:24.479
They must be beneath the police station

01:21:25.181 --> 01:21:25.943
Where is it?

01:21:25.982 --> 01:21:27.142
Hurry up, follow me

01:21:27.316 --> 01:21:28.681
I've got the application form!

01:21:29.419 --> 01:21:31.011
But we haven't
the Commissioner's signature

01:21:31.054 --> 01:21:31.952
Here it is

01:21:35.258 --> 01:21:38.022
Buddies, these are the arms I want

01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:40.991
lnspector

01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:43.396
is there a riot outside?

01:21:44.834 --> 01:21:46.631
It's incredible

01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:48.136
They have actually set up their base
beneath the police station

01:21:48.171 --> 01:21:50.139
lnspector, according to the blue print
it must be under here

01:21:52.942 --> 01:21:54.739
Did you give him a walkie talkie?

01:21:55.078 --> 01:21:56.773
No, it's a bug

01:21:56.813 --> 01:21:57.939
I put it inside his watch

01:21:58.014 --> 01:21:58.742
Does he know?

01:21:58.781 --> 01:21:59.805
No

01:22:15.431 --> 01:22:16.420
Are you alright?

01:22:16.466 --> 01:22:17.626
I am fine

01:22:19.035 --> 01:22:20.434
You are hurt

01:22:21.704 --> 01:22:23.171
Oh yeah

01:22:27.176 --> 01:22:28.700
They are cunning, better be careful

01:22:28.745 --> 01:22:29.905
Luckily you are not seriously injured
otherwise...

01:22:30.513 --> 01:22:32.481
how can I face Baby for your wedding
will be held next month

01:22:32.515 --> 01:22:33.504
That's right

01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:35.843
You'd annual leave 2 weeks ago
& you'll have honey moon next month

01:22:36.319 --> 01:22:37.251
What a lucky guy you are!

01:22:38.421 --> 01:22:39.615
Wedding is a big event in one's life
you know?

01:22:45.394 --> 01:22:47.191
Crab and his girl broke up
for a long time

01:22:48.331 --> 01:22:50.390
And, his girl isn't called Baby

01:23:08.651 --> 01:23:10.915
Something's wrong! I'll go to save him

01:23:10.953 --> 01:23:12.147
Are we going down through the gutter?

01:23:12.188 --> 01:23:13.450
You can't go, it's too dangerous

01:23:13.489 --> 01:23:14.649
Why?

01:23:14.690 --> 01:23:16.783
I can't let you take any more risk

01:23:16.926 --> 01:23:19.087
If I don't come back in half hour

01:23:19.128 --> 01:23:20.595
you should leave here at once

01:23:25.401 --> 01:23:27.335
Let me look at your face

01:23:28.805 --> 01:23:29.863
Why?

01:23:30.540 --> 01:23:31.939
Cause you promised me that

01:23:32.708 --> 01:23:34.141
You promise you'll keep this a secret

01:23:34.377 --> 01:23:35.105
Promise

01:23:35.144 --> 01:23:36.873
I won't even tell Tsui Chik, that nerd

01:23:57.633 --> 01:23:59.726
Sorry, I called you nerd

01:24:00.069 --> 01:24:01.832
Remember, you have to come back

01:24:02.772 --> 01:24:04.433
Don't worry, I'll be back

01:24:05.241 --> 01:24:06.572
I am leaving

01:24:08.244 --> 01:24:10.474
I'll wait for you for dinner

01:24:14.650 --> 01:24:17.414
Commander, download procedure
has reached the last stage

01:24:17.453 --> 01:24:18.818
Five more minutes to go

01:24:19.455 --> 01:24:23.949
Inform all the team members to begin
retreat in fifteen minutes

01:24:27.730 --> 01:24:30.358
Commander, we have unidentified object..

01:24:30.399 --> 01:24:31.957
approaching section C at a high speed

01:24:42.078 --> 01:24:43.773
They are coming

01:24:46.115 --> 01:24:49.141
Commander, these are Heat Bombs

01:24:49.185 --> 01:24:50.880
They want to distract our attention

01:25:11.207 --> 01:25:12.834
So fast!

01:25:34.864 --> 01:25:38.197
Sir, please stay and enjoy yourself

01:25:38.234 --> 01:25:41.533
I have a present for you

01:25:53.616 --> 01:25:55.914
You will soon become minced meat

01:25:56.218 --> 01:25:58.584
Cause the bomb will explode soon

01:25:58.621 --> 01:26:00.020
You've said once

01:26:06.295 --> 01:26:07.057
How long?

01:26:07.096 --> 01:26:09.030
Only two minutes left, you'd better run

01:27:15.398 --> 01:27:16.057
We still have time

01:27:16.098 --> 01:27:17.122
Either be quick

01:27:17.166 --> 01:27:18.326
or leave at once

01:27:18.667 --> 01:27:19.895
Do you have a pager?

01:27:20.202 --> 01:27:21.100
Pager?

01:27:32.415 --> 01:27:33.905
It is ticking faster than my heart beat

01:27:49.165 --> 01:27:50.063
Let's leave by different routes

01:27:50.099 --> 01:27:51.498
No!

01:28:12.121 --> 01:28:13.179
Coach

01:28:13.889 --> 01:28:16.380
I have over estimated you

01:28:16.792 --> 01:28:18.726
What is the difference between
you and a pig?

01:28:23.966 --> 01:28:26.127
Man or pig

01:28:27.036 --> 01:28:30.062
one deserves to die
if he despises his own species

01:28:32.675 --> 01:28:35.439
You are worse than a pig
you deserve to die

01:31:43.499 --> 01:31:44.727
Poisonous gas!

01:32:20.035 --> 01:32:22.401
You can't leave now

01:32:22.838 --> 01:32:24.863
Let's see for how much longer can you
hold your breath

01:33:02.578 --> 01:33:05.012
Has the police information been
completely downloaded yet?

01:34:36.104 --> 01:34:38.800
Is your heart beating slower and slower?

01:34:41.009 --> 01:34:44.274
Your blood is almost completely depleted

01:34:44.513 --> 01:34:48.574
Even if I don't kill you
you will die of heart failure

01:34:48.750 --> 01:34:50.308
Just like the General

01:34:53.755 --> 01:34:55.052
I've got the information

01:34:56.859 --> 01:34:58.190
Don't take my disc

01:35:05.267 --> 01:35:07.132
You want to get it? Come here

01:35:20.482 --> 01:35:21.540
Run for your life!

01:35:53.549 --> 01:35:55.073
Sorry for all the trouble
From now on, it's all up to you

01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:56.512
You're welcome

01:36:00.422 --> 01:36:02.390
Thank you for your white outfit

01:36:05.093 --> 01:36:08.153
I guess this is the only way
to send you away

01:36:09.331 --> 01:36:11.299
I hope when I see you again

01:36:12.534 --> 01:36:14.092
if I punch you
you'll be able to feel the pain

01:36:16.305 --> 01:36:17.863
I am determined to repair my feeling

01:36:17.906 --> 01:36:19.305
whatever it takes

01:36:19.341 --> 01:36:21.104
I am sure I can find someone
who can cure me

01:36:28.016 --> 01:36:28.983
Well, I guess it's time now

01:36:29.351 --> 01:36:31.182
The boat's leaving

01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:32.709
Wait

01:36:35.290 --> 01:36:36.655
Let's get our picture together

01:36:39.795 --> 01:36:40.762
Please!

01:36:41.663 --> 01:36:43.096
Sorry to trouble you sir, yes, come

01:36:43.131 --> 01:36:43.961
OK

01:36:44.099 --> 01:36:47.500
one, two, three, say cheer

01:36:48.305 --> 01:36:54.582
