WEBVTT

00:05.011 --> 00:07.536
Nam. It keeps
going back to Nam.

00:08.080 --> 00:09.207
<i>What?</i>

00:10.817 --> 00:12.842
Why are you
following me?

00:12.919 --> 00:13.943
Break his arm.

00:16.088 --> 00:17.351
We're in the same business.

00:17.423 --> 00:18.412
He runs drugs?

00:18.491 --> 00:19.515
Who's Kam Chung?

00:19.592 --> 00:21.184
A real heavyweight.

00:22.061 --> 00:23.392
You can let go now.

00:27.400 --> 00:28.958
What are you doing?

01:49.382 --> 01:50.906
Eight clicks?

01:50.984 --> 01:52.383
Maybe ten.

01:52.919 --> 01:54.409
This village?

01:55.221 --> 01:56.950
Montagnards, friendly.

01:57.757 --> 01:59.054
Mickey Mouse.

01:59.125 --> 02:01.355
We ought to let your guys
do it alone.

02:01.427 --> 02:03.088
Uh-uh.
No way, pal.

02:03.162 --> 02:06.495
You gotta go in and cover my
buddy Thomas. He owes me money.

02:22.081 --> 02:23.514
Hey, thanks.

02:28.488 --> 02:29.477
Taylor.

02:42.368 --> 02:43.801
Hey, Smiley.

02:51.677 --> 02:53.042
Your turn.

02:54.981 --> 02:56.107
Even.

02:58.618 --> 03:00.210
Your lucky day.

03:02.388 --> 03:04.083
Want to do it again?

03:22.875 --> 03:24.308
Let me see.

03:30.383 --> 03:31.816
That's nice.

03:32.819 --> 03:34.912
He's just
starting to walk.

03:37.390 --> 03:39.449
You're a lucky man,
pally.

03:40.693 --> 03:42.183
Yeah, I know.

03:44.664 --> 03:45.892
I know.

04:25.972 --> 04:27.997
Come in, White Knight.
This is Castle Team.

04:28.074 --> 04:30.008
<i>Hello, Castle,</i>
<i>this is White Knight.</i>

04:30.076 --> 04:31.168
<i>Welcome to the board.</i>

04:31.244 --> 04:32.472
Thank you, White Knight.

04:32.545 --> 04:34.911
Rendezvous as scheduled.
Over and out.

04:36.149 --> 04:37.343
Let's go.

06:40.006 --> 06:41.132
Taylor!

06:47.813 --> 06:50.077
Easy, pal. Easy, easy.

06:57.223 --> 07:00.215
Oh, God. Oh, God.

07:00.293 --> 07:01.624
It's cool. It's cool.
It's cool.

07:01.694 --> 07:03.924
Two weeks in Saigon
and you'll be right back here.

07:03.996 --> 07:05.122
Damn.

07:07.300 --> 07:08.392
Taylor.

07:13.306 --> 07:14.398
Ed?

07:15.841 --> 07:16.830
Oh.

07:17.576 --> 07:19.339
Oh, oh, God!

07:24.016 --> 07:26.780
Oh, God, oh, God!

07:28.821 --> 07:30.083
Oh, God!

07:42.802 --> 07:44.235
<i>Not having an office,</i>

07:44.303 --> 07:47.101
<i>I wind up meeting prospective</i>
<i>clients in all kinds of places.</i>

07:47.173 --> 07:49.232
<i>Restaurants, parks,</i>
<i>hotel rooms.</i>

07:49.308 --> 07:51.105
<i>Once even in a steam bath.</i>

07:51.444 --> 07:54.777
<i>But today was the first time</i>
<i>in a military cemetery.</i>

07:55.348 --> 07:58.511
<i>I read someplace that the</i>
<i>past is like a shadow.</i>

07:58.584 --> 08:01.178
<i>No substance,</i>
<i>but always at your heels.</i>

08:01.520 --> 08:03.420
<i>The cemetery was a reminder</i>

08:03.489 --> 08:06.083
<i>that Vietnam stays</i>
<i>awfully close to my heels.</i>

08:22.875 --> 08:24.274
Mr. Hurst?

08:30.116 --> 08:33.176
It's Taylor. Hi, I'm glad
you could come.

08:34.086 --> 08:35.280
Have we met somewhere?

08:35.354 --> 08:37.379
We were briefed together once,
at Da Nang.

08:37.456 --> 08:38.683
Operation Chessboard.

08:38.758 --> 08:41.625
I was a medic in Castle Team.
Your buddy, T.C., flew us in.

08:41.693 --> 08:43.719
Yeah, that's right.
Our teams never hooked up.

08:43.796 --> 08:46.594
No, we got hit. Uh,
friendly fire. Sort of, uh...

08:47.333 --> 08:48.891
My buddy, Ed Kanfer...

08:48.968 --> 08:50.697
His wife and kid,
they live here.

08:50.770 --> 08:51.794
Did you know him?

08:51.871 --> 08:52.769
No.

08:53.639 --> 08:55.038
It's weird.

08:55.641 --> 08:58.109
Uh, I live on the Mainland.
Seattle.

08:58.644 --> 09:01.477
And over here everything
seems so much closer.

09:02.648 --> 09:05.344
Funny how those memories
still get you.

09:06.185 --> 09:07.379
I kept up with T.C.,

09:07.453 --> 09:09.250
and he said
I should give you a call.

09:09.321 --> 09:11.721
He said that
you'd do right by me.

09:11.791 --> 09:13.224
You're a detective,
right?

09:13.292 --> 09:14.850
Private investigator.

09:16.262 --> 09:17.286
This isn't easy.

09:17.363 --> 09:19.228
I hope you're not gonna
think I'm a flake.

09:19.298 --> 09:20.629
I doubt it.

09:20.699 --> 09:22.667
Uh, this is Linda Greer.

09:23.135 --> 09:24.397
My girlfriend.

09:24.804 --> 09:27.898
Uh, three weeks ago, she came to
Hawaii to visit an old roommate.

09:27.973 --> 09:29.838
And I haven't
heard from her since.

09:29.909 --> 09:31.740
What about
her friends? Family?

09:31.811 --> 09:33.176
Same thing.

09:33.446 --> 09:34.845
You call the police?

09:34.914 --> 09:38.145
Oh, yeah. They keep telling me
about their backlogged cases,

09:38.217 --> 09:40.117
and how understaffed
they are.

09:41.554 --> 09:43.454
Let me ask you something.

09:43.522 --> 09:46.218
You and Linda,
was everything, okay?

09:46.792 --> 09:47.952
Oh, that's just it.

09:48.027 --> 09:50.188
I mean,
why this seems so awkward.

09:50.463 --> 09:52.124
But I'm kind of afraid,

09:52.198 --> 09:54.132
uh, afraid I may have
misread things,

09:54.200 --> 09:57.431
that I'm chasing after something
that's a little unreal.

09:57.503 --> 10:00.734
I've been known to do that,
especially where woman are concerned.

10:00.806 --> 10:02.831
But you can see
that's why I have to find her.

10:02.908 --> 10:05.103
I mean, not just to see if
something's happened to her,

10:05.177 --> 10:07.304
but... but to know...
but to really know.

10:08.747 --> 10:10.339
Can you help me?

10:11.550 --> 10:13.541
Well, there's not much
to go on.

10:14.653 --> 10:16.917
What can you tell me
about her friend?

10:17.089 --> 10:19.319
Uh, not very much.

10:20.926 --> 10:22.188
Her name's Celeste,

10:22.261 --> 10:25.492
she works in some club in Honolulu,
and that's all you've got, huh?

10:25.564 --> 10:27.555
Forget it, Thomas.
I gotta open for lunch.

10:27.633 --> 10:28.895
Rick, it's not for me.

10:28.968 --> 10:30.230
It's never for you.

10:30.302 --> 10:32.463
It's always for one
of your cockamamie cases.

10:32.538 --> 10:34.665
No, it's for a buddy.
A vet.

10:35.107 --> 10:36.904
Thomas, are you trying
to manipulate me?

10:36.976 --> 10:40.036
Rick, I swear... You sure you
want to tie a Windsor with this?

10:40.112 --> 10:42.205
Do you realize
how long this'll take?

10:42.281 --> 10:43.680
What's wrong
with the tie?

10:43.749 --> 10:45.546
Just get the ball rollin',
that's all.

10:45.618 --> 10:46.880
L... I don't know.

10:46.952 --> 10:49.978
Half Windsor's a lot nicer.
It's not so bulky.

10:50.489 --> 10:51.717
Thomas.

10:52.758 --> 10:55.158
Do you realize how many clubs
there are in Honolulu?

10:55.227 --> 10:56.785
I mean, I feel dumb
even asking.

10:56.862 --> 10:58.193
Blame it on me.

11:03.836 --> 11:05.599
Ice Pick? Rick, here.

11:05.671 --> 11:07.605
How're you doin'?
How's tricks?

11:09.875 --> 11:11.866
Terrific. Listen, um,

11:11.944 --> 11:13.468
I'm... I'm tryin' to run
somebody down

11:13.546 --> 11:16.310
and I have a little a bit of a problem.
I know it's a long shot.

11:16.382 --> 11:18.850
But the only contact I got
is a girl named Celeste

11:18.918 --> 11:21.716
who works tables and works
some club in Honolulu.

11:22.054 --> 11:23.783
I know it's not
much to go on.

11:23.856 --> 11:25.118
I even feel dumb
askin' you.

11:25.190 --> 11:27.556
But it's for a friend
of mine, and...

11:28.427 --> 11:30.122
Oh, yeah. Okay, great.

11:30.829 --> 11:33.423
Celeste Cole.

11:34.900 --> 11:36.868
The Wild Zebra Club.

11:39.104 --> 11:40.594
Hey, Ice Pick,
thanks a lot.

11:40.673 --> 11:42.868
By the way, the word is that
you're gonna beat that rap.

11:42.942 --> 11:45.274
That's great. You just
hang in there, baby.

11:45.344 --> 11:47.175
Okay. <i>Ciao.</i>

11:49.815 --> 11:50.804
Ice Pick?

11:50.883 --> 11:52.680
He used to sell housewares.

12:01.827 --> 12:04.694
<i>The case had started off</i>
<i>easier than I expected.</i>

12:04.763 --> 12:07.664
<i>However, my first lead</i>
<i>was hardly the place I wanted</i>

12:07.733 --> 12:09.496
<i>to find Taylor's girlfriend.</i>

12:09.568 --> 12:12.537
<i>You couldn't even trust</i>
<i>the beer in a joint like that.</i>

12:16.308 --> 12:18.242
<i>Linda and Celeste</i>
<i>were friends.</i>

12:18.310 --> 12:20.301
<i>I sure hoped</i>
<i>they weren't colleagues.</i>

12:20.379 --> 12:22.973
Uh, I'm looking
for Celeste.

12:23.048 --> 12:27.075
My friend Ice Pick says that, uh,
she zebras here.

12:32.424 --> 12:33.721
<i>Mahalo.</i>

12:44.837 --> 12:46.134
Miss Cole?

12:53.579 --> 12:56.207
Okay, Bert. Hold your horses.

12:56.281 --> 12:57.475
Miss Cole?

13:01.587 --> 13:02.679
Who are you?

13:02.755 --> 13:05.724
Uh, my name's Thomas Magnum.
I'm a private investigator.

13:05.791 --> 13:07.986
Can I ask you
a few questions?

13:08.861 --> 13:11.523
Yeah, sure. But give me
a hand, would ya?

13:14.266 --> 13:15.597
These crazy things.

13:15.668 --> 13:17.397
I never get 'em straight.

13:17.469 --> 13:18.993
Hold them, will ya?

13:20.239 --> 13:21.570
Hold them?

13:21.640 --> 13:22.607
Yeah.

13:22.675 --> 13:23.664
Oh.

13:25.177 --> 13:27.168
Now, what do you want?

13:27.279 --> 13:29.076
Oh, I'm looking for someone.

13:29.148 --> 13:30.775
I understand
she's a friend of yours.

13:30.849 --> 13:32.714
Her name's Linda Greer.

13:32.785 --> 13:34.252
Who's looking
for her?

13:34.319 --> 13:36.378
A buddy of mine was seeing
her on the Mainland.

13:36.455 --> 13:38.650
She came over here
on vacation and disappeared.

13:38.724 --> 13:40.351
He's worried about her.

13:42.428 --> 13:44.089
You can let go now.

13:44.530 --> 13:45.554
Oh.

13:47.266 --> 13:49.666
Look, do your buddy a favor.

13:49.735 --> 13:51.669
Tell him
you couldn't find her.

13:52.471 --> 13:53.563
Why?

13:56.442 --> 14:00.469
Look, right now, she's on the <i>Naida,</i>
Kam Chung's yacht.

14:03.949 --> 14:06.577
You don't know enough
to be impressed?

14:06.652 --> 14:07.641
No.

14:09.188 --> 14:12.954
Okay, Bert, I'm coming.
It's these damn ears.

14:16.562 --> 14:18.029
Who's Kam Chung?

14:18.097 --> 14:20.065
A real heavyweight.

14:21.300 --> 14:24.098
And Linda's not there
to cook. You savvy?

14:28.240 --> 14:30.265
I never get 'em straight.

14:36.648 --> 14:38.138
Extraordinary.

14:53.813 --> 14:55.940
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

14:56.549 --> 14:57.914
Not at all.

14:58.484 --> 15:00.509
Uh, I brought you something.

15:02.288 --> 15:03.550
For me?

15:04.724 --> 15:05.656
Go ahead.

15:05.725 --> 15:06.987
Oh, thank you.

15:08.661 --> 15:10.822
Oh, that's very nice.

15:10.897 --> 15:14.594
Well, I figured, if, uh, we celebrate
our success, it's got to happen.

15:18.638 --> 15:19.662
What's the matter?

15:20.840 --> 15:22.933
You don't look
too terribly happy.

15:23.543 --> 15:24.942
Something's
happened to Linda?

15:25.011 --> 15:27.241
No, no, nothing's
happened to her.

15:30.283 --> 15:33.116
Taylor, Linda's involved
with another man.

15:33.686 --> 15:34.948
Involved?

15:35.922 --> 15:37.685
What do you mean,
involved?

15:37.757 --> 15:39.884
Well, I mean, well,
she's with him.

15:39.959 --> 15:41.586
Right now, on his yacht.

15:41.661 --> 15:42.992
Did you see her?

15:43.062 --> 15:45.997
Oh, I found her friend,
Celeste, and she told me.

15:47.800 --> 15:49.165
Look, I'm sorry.

15:49.235 --> 15:50.827
If you haven't
seen her, then...

15:50.903 --> 15:52.063
Taylor.

15:52.138 --> 15:54.231
Magnum, I've got to see her.

15:54.507 --> 15:55.872
What's the point?

15:56.242 --> 15:57.641
Because I love her.

15:57.710 --> 15:58.734
I'm not gonna give up

15:58.811 --> 16:01.644
just because she's met
some guy with a yacht.

16:01.748 --> 16:02.942
What's his name?

16:03.016 --> 16:05.507
Taylor, you said yourself,

16:05.585 --> 16:08.213
you didn't want to be chasing
something that was unreal.

16:08.288 --> 16:11.155
Well, this is...
It's a dream.

16:11.224 --> 16:12.782
I'd be taking your money.

16:12.859 --> 16:13.848
Well,

16:14.494 --> 16:16.826
maybe dreams
ought to be chased.

16:19.198 --> 16:21.428
Maybe that's why
we're alive.

16:21.968 --> 16:23.959
The money doesn't mean
anything to me.

16:24.037 --> 16:25.527
The dream does.

16:27.273 --> 16:29.400
That dream is all I've got.

16:33.379 --> 16:37.179
If you don't want to go tilting
windmills with me, I understand.

16:38.584 --> 16:40.609
You can keep the bubbly.

16:42.955 --> 16:43.944
No.

16:44.691 --> 16:47.091
Actually, I don't mind
tilting windmills.

16:50.163 --> 16:53.792
I'll tell you what. I'll see her
and try and set something up.

16:53.866 --> 16:55.390
Thanks, Magnum.

17:03.409 --> 17:05.273
<i>Contrary to popular opinion,</i>

17:05.345 --> 17:07.905

17:21.560 --> 17:24.428
<i>Luckily, I just happened</i>
<i>to be on excellent terms</i>

17:24.497 --> 17:26.488
<i>with the chairman</i>
<i>of the membership committee.</i>

17:38.945 --> 17:40.435
What are you doing?

17:41.247 --> 17:43.647
Really, Magnum,
it's only powder.

17:43.716 --> 17:46.412
Higgins, I still could have
gone into cardiac arrest!

17:46.486 --> 17:48.386
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

17:48.454 --> 17:49.682
Any conception?

17:49.756 --> 17:52.247
A grown man,
playing with a cannon.

17:53.192 --> 17:54.682
The club's regatta
is next week.

17:54.761 --> 17:57.821
I'm simply determining the proper
charge to salute the winner.

17:57.897 --> 17:59.888
Uh, did the sound carry?

17:59.966 --> 18:01.866
Oh, it's just fine!

18:01.934 --> 18:04.232
Now, if you're finished
on the firing range, Higgins,

18:04.303 --> 18:05.463
I want to talk to you.

18:05.538 --> 18:09.235
No, no. Just a moment. As long as
you're here, take a few steps back.

18:15.982 --> 18:18.883
Higgins, I've been
thinking about the club.

18:19.552 --> 18:20.951
That's good.

18:21.454 --> 18:23.354
I want to become
more involved.

18:23.423 --> 18:24.549
What?

18:26.025 --> 18:28.391
I said I want to be
more involved.

18:28.661 --> 18:29.685
With what?

18:29.762 --> 18:30.786
The club!

18:31.130 --> 18:32.620
That's rather odd,
isn't it?

18:39.205 --> 18:40.672
How was that?

18:40.740 --> 18:43.436
Just perfect.
My ears are still ringing.

18:43.509 --> 18:45.340
What's so odd about it?

18:45.411 --> 18:46.503
What?

18:46.579 --> 18:48.342
What's so odd about it?

18:48.414 --> 18:50.143
You're not even a member.

18:50.583 --> 18:54.212
Well, I'm Robin's guest.
That's almost a member.

18:55.221 --> 18:56.586
Besides,

18:58.891 --> 19:01.792
I thought maybe you could
use an assistant.

19:02.128 --> 19:03.493
You must be joking.

19:03.563 --> 19:04.655
Not at all.

19:06.332 --> 19:08.266
Magnum, you'll forgive
my skepticism,

19:08.334 --> 19:11.167
but your volunteering to work
is quite out of character.

19:11.237 --> 19:12.829
You see?

19:12.905 --> 19:15.897
That's just the kind of
misconception that can occur

19:15.975 --> 19:19.138
when two people don't try
to get to know one another.

19:19.212 --> 19:21.146
The club has been
very good to me.

19:21.214 --> 19:24.581
I simply want to return water
to the well, so to speak.

19:24.650 --> 19:25.708
What?

19:27.253 --> 19:29.949
I simply want to return water
to the well,

19:30.022 --> 19:31.250
so to speak.

19:33.192 --> 19:34.489
You're serious?

19:34.727 --> 19:35.921
Absolutely.

19:36.596 --> 19:38.996
You are actually
willing to work?

19:40.466 --> 19:41.956
To assist me?

19:43.269 --> 19:45.066
Without remuneration?

19:49.408 --> 19:50.739
Why, Magnum,

19:50.910 --> 19:54.903
I'm very pleased by this rare
demonstration of responsibility.

19:55.348 --> 19:57.782
You most certainly
can be my assistant.

19:57.850 --> 19:59.408
Great. When do we
get to work?

19:59.485 --> 20:00.645
You said something

20:00.720 --> 20:03.018
about interviewing prospective members,
I believe.

20:03.089 --> 20:04.920
Magnum,
my responsibilities extend

20:04.991 --> 20:06.856
far beyond
the membership committee.

20:06.926 --> 20:08.757
I think you'd be
much better suited

20:08.828 --> 20:10.796
to something
more fundamental.

20:11.430 --> 20:12.454
Fundamental?

20:12.532 --> 20:15.797
In my study are
3,247 member files

20:15.868 --> 20:18.063
which need collating
and alphabetizing.

20:18.137 --> 20:20.935
As my assistant,
you can start immediately.

20:36.255 --> 20:37.984
<i>Luckily, the member files</i>

20:38.057 --> 20:39.991
<i>were next to</i>
<i>the prospective member files.</i>

20:40.059 --> 20:43.256
<i>Higgins hadn't interviewed Kam</i>
<i>Chung yet, so I didn't get much.</i>

20:43.329 --> 20:47.163
<i>He was being sponsored by Adm.</i>
<i>Ivor Naismith, U.S.N., retired,</i>

20:47.233 --> 20:49.201
<i>and he owned</i>
<i>an import company.</i>

20:49.268 --> 20:51.065
<i>In my day,</i>
<i>Adm. Naismith had been</i>

20:51.137 --> 20:53.537
<i>affectionately known</i>
<i>as "Ivor the Terrible."</i>

20:53.606 --> 20:56.074
<i>I decided to try</i>
<i>the import company first.</i>

20:58.210 --> 21:02.044
<i>I figured Kam Chung to be a wealthy,</i>
<i>possibly dangerous man.</i>

21:02.348 --> 21:04.543
<i>The limo just had to be his.</i>

21:04.984 --> 21:07.509
<i>Besides,</i>
<i>it was the only car there.</i>

23:00.766 --> 23:03.098
Not a sound,
or I'll break your arm.

23:07.707 --> 23:08.731
Hi.

23:08.808 --> 23:11.003
Why are you following me?

23:11.077 --> 23:12.942
What makes you think
I'm following... Aah!

23:13.012 --> 23:14.138
Break his arm.

23:15.448 --> 23:17.211
My name is Thomas Magnum.

23:17.283 --> 23:20.411
I'm a private investigator,
and I was hired to find someone.

23:20.486 --> 23:21.578
Who?

23:22.354 --> 23:24.481
The lady you took to lunch.

23:26.726 --> 23:28.216
Who hired you?

23:29.028 --> 23:30.723
I'm afraid I can't
tell you that.

23:30.796 --> 23:31.854
Break his arm.

23:32.998 --> 23:35.899
Come on, Kam.
I got to get my nails done.

23:36.435 --> 23:37.800
Who's this guy?

23:38.471 --> 23:39.870
You tell me.

23:40.172 --> 23:42.163
Never saw him
before in my life.

23:42.808 --> 23:44.742
Wait, she's
telling the truth.

23:44.810 --> 23:47.244
Taylor hired me.
He was worried about you.

23:47.646 --> 23:49.477
Who is this Taylor?

23:51.117 --> 23:52.607
I don't know.

23:54.487 --> 23:56.387
Taylor Hurst,
from Seattle.

23:56.455 --> 23:59.390
Why don't you just see him,
tell him it's over?

23:59.725 --> 24:02.660
He's lying. I don't know
any Taylor Hurst.

24:02.728 --> 24:05.094
And I've never
even been to Seattle.

24:05.164 --> 24:07.155
Please, Kam, believe me.

24:07.833 --> 24:09.027
Please.

24:09.769 --> 24:11.293
I love you.

24:15.107 --> 24:17.007
I don't know
who you are, mister,

24:17.076 --> 24:18.907
or what your game is,

24:18.978 --> 24:20.843
but this is
one lousy trick.

24:25.518 --> 24:28.043
You just dropped
this case, yes?

24:28.120 --> 24:29.178
Yeah.

24:29.622 --> 24:31.886
Good.
Break his arm, anyway.

24:35.394 --> 24:37.862
Just wanted to see
your expression.

25:11.795 --> 25:13.888
Lily, the next time
I take a business trip,

25:13.964 --> 25:15.488
I'm bringing you along.

25:15.566 --> 25:18.399
You're more effective
than a tranquilizer.

25:23.574 --> 25:26.634
If he wants to see me,
he talks to me in here.

25:27.845 --> 25:29.608
It never ends, Lily.

25:29.813 --> 25:31.940
What's the old expression?

25:32.016 --> 25:34.177
"There's no rest
for the weary."

25:35.719 --> 25:37.186
Mr. Hiramoto.

25:37.488 --> 25:39.046
Good afternoon, Rick.

25:39.189 --> 25:40.986
I appreciate
your seeing me.

25:41.291 --> 25:43.384
Pull up a table.
Inger!

25:43.460 --> 25:45.894
That's okay. It's...

25:45.963 --> 25:47.260
I insist.

25:49.700 --> 25:50.689
Well?

25:51.468 --> 25:52.662
What do you want?

25:54.338 --> 25:57.774
Um, a buddy of mine needs some
information about a guy named Kam Chung.

26:00.744 --> 26:01.972
Does it hurt?

26:02.046 --> 26:03.138
Just a little.

26:03.213 --> 26:05.272
Good. That means
it's therapeutic.

26:05.349 --> 26:06.577
Great.

26:06.917 --> 26:10.717
Course, uh, I don't expect
the information gratis.

26:12.222 --> 26:15.191
If you're ever in Brooklyn
and you need anything,

26:15.259 --> 26:18.057
anything at all,
you just give me a call.

26:18.362 --> 26:19.989
You know what I mean?

26:20.597 --> 26:22.462
I hate the East Coast.

26:22.733 --> 26:26.294
It's too cold in the winter,
too humid in the summer.

26:26.937 --> 26:29.132
Got any connections in Vegas?

26:29.840 --> 26:31.000
Sorry.

26:31.375 --> 26:32.364
Well,

26:33.644 --> 26:36.670
then you just have
to return the favor here.

26:39.116 --> 26:41.846
I know Chung.
That is, I know of him.

26:42.686 --> 26:44.449
He's a secretive man.

26:44.755 --> 26:46.154
We're in the same business.

26:46.223 --> 26:47.451
He runs drugs?

26:49.993 --> 26:51.654
I'm an importer.

26:51.795 --> 26:53.660
Right, right,
Mr. Hiramoto.

26:56.400 --> 26:58.561
Kam Chung is new
to the Islands.

26:58.635 --> 27:00.626
He learned his trade
in Vietnam.

27:01.505 --> 27:04.338
I understand he used to be
an ARVIN general.

27:04.408 --> 27:07.309
ARVIN general?
I thought he was Chinese.

27:07.377 --> 27:09.174
Chinese extraction.

27:12.149 --> 27:13.173
Yeah.

27:13.250 --> 27:16.276
He did very well up there
before the pullout.

27:17.254 --> 27:19.222
He just bought an island
off Molokai.

27:19.289 --> 27:20.722
Great massage, huh?

27:20.791 --> 27:22.725
Oh, yeah. Just great.

27:25.629 --> 27:27.756
Don't get up
on my account.

27:28.966 --> 27:30.160
Oh.

27:30.367 --> 27:31.664
I insist.

27:34.071 --> 27:35.163
Rick.

27:42.246 --> 27:44.544
Now turn over.

28:08.672 --> 28:10.264
Where have you been?

28:11.041 --> 28:12.303
Where have I been?

28:12.376 --> 28:14.844
I've been out doing your legwork,
that's where I've been.

28:14.912 --> 28:16.038
And what happened?

28:16.113 --> 28:17.444
I got a massage.

28:17.514 --> 28:19.277
You stopped
for a massage?

28:19.349 --> 28:20.839
It was part of the deal.

28:20.918 --> 28:22.078
Never mind.

28:22.152 --> 28:23.585
Are you all right?
Yeah.

28:23.654 --> 28:25.417
Well, what did you
get on Kam Chung?

28:26.824 --> 28:28.917
He used to be
an ARVIN general.

28:28.992 --> 28:31.085
He also moonlighted
as a drug runner.

28:31.161 --> 28:33.095
Now he does it full time.

28:33.163 --> 28:35.723
He lives on a little island
off Molokai.

28:35.966 --> 28:39.868
You know, if you want more
information on this guy,
why don't you talk to Higgins?

28:39.937 --> 28:43.100
He's interviewing him today
about membership in the club.

28:48.679 --> 28:51.910
I think a few words of thanks
would be in order about now.

28:51.982 --> 28:54.780
Nam. It keeps
going back to Nam.

28:54.852 --> 28:55.876
What?

28:55.953 --> 28:58.251
His buddy, the team,
Kam Chung.

28:59.923 --> 29:01.720
Some word of thanks.

29:02.426 --> 29:04.189
What about the girl?

29:04.361 --> 29:05.794
No, she's telling the truth.

29:05.863 --> 29:07.125
Taylor's up to somethin'.

29:07.197 --> 29:10.530
Look, see if you can locate the
widow of a guy named Ed Kanfer.

29:10.601 --> 29:12.228
He died in
Operation Chessboard.

29:12.302 --> 29:14.361
Wait a minute. How am I
supposed to do that?

29:14.438 --> 29:16.030
I don't know.
Try the phone book.

29:16.106 --> 29:17.767
Why don't you try
the phone book?

29:17.841 --> 29:19.775
'Cause I'm going
to see Taylor.

29:21.712 --> 29:22.974
Terrific.

29:24.514 --> 29:25.742
Kanfer.

29:29.620 --> 29:32.919
<i>There are several things in</i>
<i>my line of work I really hate.</i>

29:32.990 --> 29:34.719
<i>But up near</i>
<i>the top of the list,</i>

29:34.791 --> 29:37.487
<i>I have to put</i>
<i>being lied to by my client.</i>

29:37.561 --> 29:40.189
<i>It definitely sours</i>
<i>the relationship.</i>

29:43.901 --> 29:45.061
Taylor.

29:51.808 --> 29:54.208
<i>One good thing</i>
<i>about a place like this:</i>

29:54.278 --> 29:57.736
<i>The locks are old, fairly simple,</i>
<i>and a breeze to pick.</i>

29:59.917 --> 30:02.385
Hey, what do you think
you're doing?

30:02.452 --> 30:03.646
I lost my key.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.244
That's Mr. Hurst's room.

30:05.322 --> 30:06.448
Can't be.

30:06.523 --> 30:09.048
Hey, I'll call the cops.
You can't do this.

30:09.993 --> 30:12.257
When did...
when did he check out?

30:12.329 --> 30:13.489
He didn't.

30:15.432 --> 30:17.127
Damn. Deadbeats.

30:17.200 --> 30:18.997
That's all I get.
Deadbeats.

30:25.742 --> 30:28.802
That was the paddy where a
sniper took out two of our guys.

30:28.879 --> 30:30.847
And your dad's the one
that got him.

30:30.914 --> 30:32.006
Yeah?
Yeah.

30:32.082 --> 30:33.913
Oh, your dad,
he was the best.

30:33.984 --> 30:36.976
He always fought honorably,
always with honor.

30:39.156 --> 30:42.421
What about you? You were good, too.
You had to be good.

30:42.492 --> 30:46.087
Nah, all I did was push pills
and patch 'em up.

30:46.563 --> 30:48.463
That sounds
pretty good to me.

30:48.532 --> 30:50.762
Mom, Taylor told me
about this time

30:50.834 --> 30:53.564
Dad and him went to
this movie in Saigon.

30:53.637 --> 30:55.298
And there was
this one-legged man

30:55.372 --> 30:57.465
selling watches
in the men's room.

30:58.608 --> 31:00.303
He told me, too.

31:02.412 --> 31:05.472
Honey, would you leave us alone
for a minute? We need to talk.

31:05.549 --> 31:06.641
Okay.

31:06.783 --> 31:08.614
See you later,
right?

31:09.119 --> 31:10.677
Right. You bet.

31:13.023 --> 31:15.753
Ah, Donny's looking
more like Ed every day.

31:15.826 --> 31:17.191
Some kid.

31:17.327 --> 31:18.954
He loves you very much.

31:19.596 --> 31:20.585
Yeah.

31:26.970 --> 31:27.959
Taylor.

31:30.941 --> 31:31.930
You said this time...

31:32.009 --> 31:33.636
I'd stay. I meant it.

31:34.478 --> 31:37.538
Then why don't you move in?
What do we need to wait for?

31:48.592 --> 31:49.957
What is it?

31:50.460 --> 31:52.553
I don't know.
It's just...

31:52.763 --> 31:55.027
Sometimes,
when I remember...

31:56.433 --> 31:58.458
Do you think Ed
wouldn't have wanted this?

31:58.535 --> 31:59.695
You and me?

31:59.770 --> 32:02.671
No, that's just it.
I'm sure he wouldn't mind.

32:02.739 --> 32:04.969
But that doesn't
make it any easier.

32:06.476 --> 32:07.943
Taylor.

32:09.413 --> 32:12.211
I loved him.
I always will.

32:13.016 --> 32:14.540
But he's gone.

32:16.553 --> 32:18.020
Eleven years.

32:18.922 --> 32:21.083
That's an awfully long time.

32:21.691 --> 32:23.215
Doesn't seem so long.

32:23.326 --> 32:24.554
It does to me.

32:26.263 --> 32:28.231
When I look at Donny

32:28.765 --> 32:30.096
or myself...

32:32.002 --> 32:34.766
When I think
of all those nights alone...

32:36.807 --> 32:38.240
I buried Ed.

32:38.308 --> 32:40.276
Don't you think
it's time you did?

32:40.343 --> 32:41.742
I'm trying.

32:42.446 --> 32:44.346
That's why I came back.

32:44.414 --> 32:46.814
I just have to do it
my own way.

32:48.752 --> 32:49.946
Mary,

32:50.987 --> 32:52.352
I love you.

32:53.190 --> 32:54.555
Believe me.

33:01.364 --> 33:03.389
I love you, too.
I love you, too.

33:05.302 --> 33:06.792
Mrs. Kanfer?

33:13.376 --> 33:14.809
Give me a minute
to get out back.

33:14.878 --> 33:15.867
Taylor,
what is it?

33:15.946 --> 33:17.971
I don't wanna talk to that man,
you haven't seen me.

33:18.048 --> 33:19.072
Mrs. Kanfer?

33:19.149 --> 33:20.241
Coming. Just a minute.
Why?

33:20.317 --> 33:22.615
Trust me. I'll tell you
about it later.

33:25.422 --> 33:26.411
Yes?

33:26.490 --> 33:27.957
I'm Thomas Magnum.

33:28.024 --> 33:29.514
I'm a friend
of Taylor Hurst.

33:29.593 --> 33:30.787
Oh, he's not here.

33:30.861 --> 33:32.260
Do you know
where I can find him?

33:32.329 --> 33:33.261
Sorry.

33:33.330 --> 33:34.627
No, wait.

33:34.698 --> 33:36.563
Let me
ask you something.

33:36.633 --> 33:38.157
Do you know him well?

33:39.636 --> 33:42.230
I don't see how that's
any concern of yours.

33:42.305 --> 33:44.671
Well, the truth is,
I'm a private investigator,

33:44.741 --> 33:47.835
and Taylor hired me to find someone
he said he was in love with.

33:47.911 --> 33:50.505
And It turned out
she didn't even know him.

33:50.580 --> 33:51.979
I can't help you,
Mr. Magnum.

33:52.048 --> 33:53.675
I think you can.

33:53.750 --> 33:56.218
I think this has something
to do with your late husband.

33:56.286 --> 33:57.514
With Vietnam.

33:57.787 --> 33:59.118
With Ed?

33:59.923 --> 34:02.619
Well, I don't know.
I- I'd hoped you could tell me.

34:04.761 --> 34:07.423
Mrs. Kanfer,
I only want to help Taylor.

34:07.564 --> 34:08.588
Mr. Magnum,

34:09.766 --> 34:12.701
Taylor's been the best friend
I've ever had.

34:13.303 --> 34:16.329
After Ed died, he took care of
my son and me. He still does.

34:16.406 --> 34:17.998
Believe me, I don't
want to hurt him.

34:18.074 --> 34:19.701
Well, neither do I.

34:19.775 --> 34:22.108
He just has to resolve
some things, that's all.

34:22.179 --> 34:23.612
What things?

34:24.014 --> 34:26.208
Taylor never really
got over Ed's death.

34:26.283 --> 34:27.681
The way he died.

34:27.751 --> 34:29.446
He just has some things
to work out.

34:29.518 --> 34:31.714
That's all. So, if you
just leave him alone...

34:31.788 --> 34:35.518
Mrs. Kanfer, your husband was
killed on a mission, wasn't he?

34:36.592 --> 34:37.958
Yes and no.

34:39.262 --> 34:42.025
Ed stepped on a mine.
Later, it turned out

34:42.098 --> 34:44.259
it was planted by smugglers.

34:46.168 --> 34:48.295
They weren't even Vietcong.

34:49.371 --> 34:51.306
They were drug runners.

34:57.896 --> 35:00.956
Sure, I know the island.
No sweat.

35:01.566 --> 35:02.760
You know somethin' funny?

35:02.834 --> 35:05.462
I have never been able
to get into fishin'.

35:05.537 --> 35:07.266
Course,
with my delicate skin,

35:07.339 --> 35:09.034
I've got to be very
careful of the sun.

35:10.175 --> 35:12.700
That's too bad. It's a great
way to spend your free time.

35:12.778 --> 35:15.941
Free time? Man, I don't know
nothin' about no free time.

35:16.014 --> 35:18.949
Most of mine is spent dodging
Thomas' clients' bullets.

35:20.852 --> 35:22.683
Okay, I'm ready.

35:22.754 --> 35:24.984
All right, just give me a second.
I'll be right with you.

35:25.056 --> 35:27.820
You know, I didn't realize there
was good fishin' over there.

35:27.893 --> 35:30.987
I've taken a lot of fishermen out,
but never there.

35:31.062 --> 35:33.155
Well, that's why
the fishing's so good.

36:40.465 --> 36:41.397
Two days?

36:41.466 --> 36:43.593
Yeah.
I'll meet you here.

36:43.969 --> 36:45.766
I hope you like Opakapaka.

36:45.837 --> 36:47.099
I love it.

38:37.716 --> 38:39.707
Hurry. He wants
drinks in 20 minutes.

38:39.784 --> 38:40.876
I'll be ready.

38:40.952 --> 38:43.284
Make it good.
This is important.

39:33.405 --> 39:35.339
No, no, no!
Get out of here.

39:35.407 --> 39:36.431
You're late.

39:36.508 --> 39:38.976
You're getting
real undependable. Come on.

39:39.044 --> 39:41.672
Undependable?
Undependable?

39:41.746 --> 39:43.714
Uh-uh, You just want
something out of me.

39:43.782 --> 39:44.908
That's what it is.

39:44.983 --> 39:48.111
T.C., I gotta get to an island
off Molokai. Come on.

39:48.186 --> 39:51.178
I just come from
an island off Molokai.

39:51.256 --> 39:52.245
Taylor?

39:53.591 --> 39:54.683
Fishin'.

39:54.759 --> 39:57.421
No, hunting. He's gonna
try and kill someone.

40:06.404 --> 40:09.168
Mr. Higgins,
I'm so glad you could come.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.434
The pleasure is mine.

40:10.508 --> 40:12.703
I hope you found
Howard's seamanship adequate.

40:12.777 --> 40:13.766
More than adequate.

40:13.845 --> 40:17.281
Good. I hope my hospitality will
compensate you for the trip,

40:17.348 --> 40:19.748
and that you'll find me
worthy of the club.

40:19.818 --> 40:21.080
Thank you.

41:29.220 --> 41:31.780
You don't get much rain
out here, do you?

41:31.856 --> 41:34.518
No, not too much rain
at this time of the year.

41:34.592 --> 41:37.152
Sometimes,
it gets a little warm.

41:38.196 --> 41:39.527
Please, sit.

41:39.597 --> 41:40.689
Thank you.

41:55.647 --> 41:57.046
To the club.

41:57.715 --> 41:59.114
To the club.

42:05.089 --> 42:08.991
Since I'm constrained
to ask a few questions,

42:09.494 --> 42:11.519
perhaps we should
get them out of the way.

42:11.596 --> 42:13.063
By all means.

42:21.105 --> 42:22.504
Now then, uh,

42:23.474 --> 42:27.035
if you were admitted,
would you plan on entertaining, uh,

42:27.111 --> 42:28.237
show people?

42:28.313 --> 42:29.473
Show people?

42:30.415 --> 42:31.404
Never.

42:31.983 --> 42:33.075
Good.

42:35.053 --> 42:38.887
Do you consider the club a
suitable place to conduct business?

42:39.591 --> 42:42.856
In my opinion, one's business
should be left at the office.

42:43.094 --> 42:44.721
How very true.

42:47.699 --> 42:48.996
The island's just ahead.

42:49.067 --> 42:51.535
We'll be there
in a couple of minutes.

43:06.751 --> 43:08.981
Hypothetically speaking,
of course,

43:09.053 --> 43:11.180
do you consider it
more important to pay

43:11.256 --> 43:13.281
one's tailor
or one's gambling debts?

43:13.358 --> 43:15.826
One's gambling debts
must always be paid.

43:15.927 --> 43:17.394
They take priority.

43:17.795 --> 43:19.126
I quite agree.

43:19.897 --> 43:22.923
It's amazing how many people
consider these questions trivial.

43:24.168 --> 43:28.002
Uh, at the regatta ball,
what do you consider proper dress?

43:28.072 --> 43:29.801
Dress whites
for naval officers and,

43:29.874 --> 43:32.342
of course, white tie
for civilian members.

43:33.378 --> 43:35.710
I admire
your sartorial taste,

43:35.780 --> 43:38.408
but we would not expect
more than black tie.

43:38.549 --> 43:40.107
How unfortunate.

43:40.451 --> 43:41.383
Yes.

43:45.823 --> 43:47.313
Set her down there.

43:47.392 --> 43:48.950
We'll ruin the party.

43:49.027 --> 43:50.187
Better us.

43:50.962 --> 43:53.192
Higgins ain't
gonna like this.

44:07.912 --> 44:09.607
Good Lord.

44:11.649 --> 44:13.276
Uh, friends of yours?

44:13.918 --> 44:14.850
Hardly.

44:16.087 --> 44:17.247
No. Allow me.

44:26.864 --> 44:30.061
Magnum,
of all the unmitigated gall.

44:30.134 --> 44:31.533
I'm glad to see you,
too, Higgins.

44:31.602 --> 44:32.728
What are you doing?

44:32.804 --> 44:34.897
I'm trying to stop
a murder, I think.

44:34.972 --> 44:36.803
It's an execution!

44:38.343 --> 44:41.210
Don't even think about it.
Throw your gun aside.

44:45.917 --> 44:47.316
Over there.

44:54.859 --> 44:56.759
Taylor,
what's the point?

44:56.828 --> 44:58.693
Ed was my buddy,
Magnum.

44:58.763 --> 45:00.094
We all lost buddies.

45:00.164 --> 45:02.064
Not the way Ed got it.

45:02.667 --> 45:04.726
So I made him a promise.

45:05.503 --> 45:09.303
I knelt over his body
and I made him a promise.

45:10.308 --> 45:12.435
They'd get it the same way.

45:12.877 --> 45:14.970
Ed never asked
for that promise.

45:15.046 --> 45:16.479
And it won't help him now.

45:18.015 --> 45:19.812
Or help Mary, either.

45:21.486 --> 45:25.115
Taylor, I know that anger.
I know how you feel.

45:25.456 --> 45:27.447
But this won't
make it go away.

45:31.763 --> 45:33.253
Stay where you are.

45:33.331 --> 45:35.060
Put down your gun,
Taylor.

45:35.133 --> 45:36.600
I mean it, Tom.

45:37.034 --> 45:38.626
I don't think so.

45:39.170 --> 45:40.262
All right.

45:41.906 --> 45:43.533
But he's gonna tell you.

45:43.608 --> 45:45.769
He's gonna tell you
all about it.

45:45.843 --> 45:47.743
Bin Loc. 1971.

45:56.287 --> 45:58.585
Bin Loc. 1971.

45:58.890 --> 46:01.450
I don't understand.
I commanded a division which was...

46:01.526 --> 46:02.686
Louder!

46:02.894 --> 46:06.159
I commanded a division which
was operating in the area.

46:06.230 --> 46:07.857
And running drugs.

46:07.932 --> 46:10.162
Some of my subordinates,
perhaps.

46:10.234 --> 46:13.067
But you're the one with the
Swiss bank account, General.

46:13.137 --> 46:16.436
It was a long time ago.
Some things were unavoidable.

46:18.676 --> 46:20.439
You're buying time.

46:20.511 --> 46:22.604
You're gonna hit him
the same way.

46:22.680 --> 46:24.944
Don't come any closer.
Magnum!

47:16.434 --> 47:19.028
Was there anything
I could have done?

47:19.904 --> 47:21.565
Should have done?

47:22.273 --> 47:24.434
I ask myself
the same thing.

47:26.577 --> 47:28.568
I guess Taylor
wanted this.

47:29.847 --> 47:31.838
At least,
a part of him did.

47:32.283 --> 47:33.375
Why?

47:35.453 --> 47:37.148
Sometimes it's hard

47:38.589 --> 47:40.716
to be the one
who came back.

47:44.462 --> 47:48.262
Tell me, Thomas,
when's the war going to end?

47:51.536 --> 47:53.003
I don't know.
