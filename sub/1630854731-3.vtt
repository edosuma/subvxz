WEBVTT

00:01.827 --> 00:03.177
We have a bunch of errands
to run this weekend,

00:03.177 --> 00:05.048
so can we try and get
to the abandoned mall

00:05.048 --> 00:07.311
early to avoid
the radioactive zombies?

00:07.311 --> 00:08.530
They make parking
a nightmare.

00:08.530 --> 00:10.227
Mm, I need to finish
reading this old

00:10.227 --> 00:12.316
box of toothpaste
before book club.

00:12.316 --> 00:14.318
Had a great beginning
where the toothpaste was minty,

00:14.318 --> 00:15.754
but now I'm in
this boring part

00:15.754 --> 00:18.931
where four out of five
dentists recommend it.

00:18.931 --> 00:20.542
Well, good night.

00:24.285 --> 00:25.590
Should we have sex?

00:25.590 --> 00:27.157
W-What?
I don't know.

00:27.157 --> 00:30.160
It's just been a while
since we last did it.

00:30.160 --> 00:33.729
Might be nice to give the
Little Warlord some fresh air.

00:33.729 --> 00:36.558
Yeah, no, I wasn't exactly
in a, like, sex frame of mind,

00:36.558 --> 00:38.168
but, no, definitely,
let's do it.

00:38.168 --> 00:41.215
Let's have
sexual intercourse...

00:41.215 --> 00:42.346
baby.

00:42.346 --> 00:44.174
All right.

00:46.133 --> 00:48.265
I'll just mount
the ol' war rig...

00:48.265 --> 00:49.310
Yeah.

00:49.310 --> 00:50.615
Sorry.

00:50.615 --> 00:52.313
That was
the Indian food.

00:52.313 --> 00:54.010
That's okay.
There we go.

00:59.015 --> 01:00.364
Hi.

01:00.364 --> 01:02.584
Uh, does Scraps have
to be here?

01:02.584 --> 01:04.586
It's fine. He doesn't even
know what he's seeing.

01:04.586 --> 01:07.545
No, yes, I do.
It's sex, and I like it.

01:12.942 --> 01:14.378
That's good.

01:14.378 --> 01:15.901
That's real good.

01:17.207 --> 01:18.556
Maybe we should just
take a rain check.

01:18.556 --> 01:20.036
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:20.036 --> 01:21.342
What?

01:31.178 --> 01:32.788
At noon, you have
your meeting

01:32.788 --> 01:34.268
with the Trash Pickers Union.

01:34.268 --> 01:35.791
Devon, quit selling doodads
and focus on gizmos!

01:35.791 --> 01:37.358
At 2:00 p.m.,
you wanted to survey

01:37.358 --> 01:39.273
the floating garbage island
that just washed ashore.

01:39.273 --> 01:40.970
Keep sorting, Sikowsky!

01:40.970 --> 01:42.276
Just because you
don't have arms

01:42.276 --> 01:43.364
doesn't mean
your teeth don't work.

01:43.364 --> 01:45.017
Oh, and later on,

01:45.017 --> 01:46.410
you've got your 40-year
high school reunion.

01:46.410 --> 01:47.716
That's fun!

01:47.716 --> 01:49.544
Oof, no, thanks.

01:49.544 --> 01:51.241
Believe it or not,
I wasn't exactly

01:51.241 --> 01:53.243
"Mister Popular"
in high school.

01:53.243 --> 01:55.289
Everyone called me
Moaning Morris--

01:55.289 --> 01:57.247
because I moaned so much
when they punched me.

01:57.247 --> 02:00.207
But they only punched me
because I moaned.

02:00.207 --> 02:02.296
It was a real
chicken-and-egg situation.

02:02.296 --> 02:03.993
Right. But that was--
that was a long time ago,

02:03.993 --> 02:05.429
Mr Rubinstein.

02:05.429 --> 02:07.170
Don't you want to go back
and show your old classmates

02:07.170 --> 02:09.216
what kind of a man
you've become?

02:09.216 --> 02:10.826
Hey, you're right.

02:10.826 --> 02:13.481
I'm probably way more successful
than those schmucks.

02:13.481 --> 02:16.266
And now I can really rub it
in their stinkin' faces!

02:16.266 --> 02:17.702
Right.
That seems like an almost

02:17.702 --> 02:20.618
willful misinterpretation
of what I said, but okay.

02:20.618 --> 02:22.490
Thanks, Sid!

02:22.490 --> 02:24.796
That was great advice
you gave me, as I understood it.

02:24.796 --> 02:27.059
Great.

02:32.021 --> 02:34.850
Hey!
You get out of here!

02:34.850 --> 02:37.069
Next time I see you,
I'm gonna kill you!

02:37.069 --> 02:38.288
You hear me?!

02:38.288 --> 02:43.032
I'll kill you!

02:43.032 --> 02:45.513
Phew!
Another close one.

02:45.513 --> 02:47.210
Good thing I'm here
to protect the place.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.429
Mm-hmm.

02:48.429 --> 02:51.127
So, I had the hottest sex
last night with this

02:51.127 --> 02:52.824
Rube Goldberg machine.

02:52.824 --> 02:55.131
He did this thing where
he tipped a row of dominos,

02:55.131 --> 02:57.264
which made a bowling ball
roll down a ramp,

02:57.264 --> 02:59.440
which lit a candle,
and long story short,

02:59.440 --> 03:01.877
a mousetrap
fell on my penis.

03:01.877 --> 03:02.921
That sounds hot.

03:02.921 --> 03:05.272
It was.

03:05.272 --> 03:07.187
Just, back in the Wasteland,
Sid and I used to do it

03:07.187 --> 03:10.625
all the time--
in the car, in the sand,

03:10.625 --> 03:12.714
once midair,
falling off a cliff.

03:12.714 --> 03:14.324
- Mmm.
- But now that we're married,

03:14.324 --> 03:16.935
it's like
we're business partners

03:16.935 --> 03:18.415
that just happen
to live together.

03:18.415 --> 03:20.374
See, this is what happens
when you decide

03:20.374 --> 03:23.290
to spend your life
with the exact same person.

03:23.290 --> 03:25.335
Your passion is gonna
continue to dwindle,

03:25.335 --> 03:27.119
until you'll become like
all these other

03:27.119 --> 03:29.557
Boomtown couples,
whose only idea of romance

03:29.557 --> 03:33.213
is a weekly date night
at the Boomtown Bistro.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.780
That sounds horrible! I don't
want that for me and Sid!

03:35.780 --> 03:39.958
Don't worry.
You're with a licensed sexpert.

03:39.958 --> 03:41.743
That's "sex"
plus "expert."

03:41.743 --> 03:43.701
Right, yeah.
No, I got that.

03:43.701 --> 03:45.225
So why didn't you laugh?

03:48.750 --> 03:52.319
Morris Rubinstein, CEO,
Morris's Junk Emporium.

03:52.319 --> 03:55.017
Welcome, Morris!
You're the last one to arrive.

03:55.017 --> 03:58.499
Am I late?
Oh, let me check with my Rolex.

03:59.717 --> 04:00.936
Here's your name tag.

04:00.936 --> 04:02.503
Thank you.

04:02.503 --> 04:07.377
Well, guess I'll make
my grand entrance, then.

04:18.867 --> 04:20.521
They're all skeletons.

04:20.521 --> 04:24.046
Yes, unfortunately,
they all died in The Boom.

04:24.046 --> 04:26.004
Well, there's no point
bragging about my success

04:26.004 --> 04:28.529
if they're all dead.

04:28.529 --> 04:31.401
I'm gonna go.

04:31.401 --> 04:34.274
Say, is that Ron Miller?

04:34.274 --> 04:36.537
I'd recognize that
big oaf anywhere.

04:36.537 --> 04:37.929
Hey, Miller!

04:37.929 --> 04:40.280
Yeah, thought you
were so cool?

04:40.280 --> 04:43.195
Well, now you're dead,
and I've got a Rolex!

04:47.112 --> 04:50.028
Freya, Sid, thank you
for agreeing to do

04:50.028 --> 04:53.031
this important work
for your relationship.

04:53.031 --> 04:55.077
Yeah, I'm not sure
I'm comfortable

04:55.077 --> 04:56.600
talking about
this kind of stuff,

04:56.600 --> 04:59.211
especially with your famously
bitchy best friend.

04:59.211 --> 05:01.997
Oh, everything said here
is completely confidential.

05:01.997 --> 05:05.870
Unless, of course, I think
it's funny or just plain nasty.

05:05.870 --> 05:08.395
Sid, we have to figure out a way
to save our sex life.

05:08.395 --> 05:11.528
Okay?
It's important to me.

05:11.528 --> 05:14.836
Yeah, uh, okay.
Yeah, let's-- let's do it.

05:14.836 --> 05:16.664
That's the spirit.

05:16.664 --> 05:19.275
Now, I'm gonna need you to put
on your neural transmitters.

05:19.275 --> 05:21.451
You'll feel the teensiest
little pinch

05:21.451 --> 05:24.236
as the brain-stinger
shoots into your spine.

05:24.236 --> 05:25.368
Sorry, what?

05:33.942 --> 05:37.554
Uh...
where are we?

05:37.554 --> 05:41.906
A place to explore the outer
reaches of your sexual reality.

05:43.125 --> 05:44.474
Welcome...

05:44.474 --> 05:48.260
to the Matrix-x-x.

05:48.260 --> 05:50.698
So, w-w-why are you saying
it like that?

05:50.698 --> 05:54.049
Oh, it's like the Matrix
but with three X's at the end.

05:54.049 --> 05:56.660
You know, like a sex thing?

05:57.705 --> 05:59.663
Oh.

05:59.663 --> 06:01.143
You kind of have to see it
written out for it to work.

06:01.143 --> 06:02.449
No, no, it works.
It's good.

06:02.449 --> 06:04.973
Yeah, it's funny.

06:04.973 --> 06:07.279
Anyway...

06:08.542 --> 06:11.632
The Matrix-x-x is
a simulated reality.

06:11.632 --> 06:15.897
Your bodies are back in the real
world, being watched by Scraps.

06:15.897 --> 06:17.638
Scraps, do you read me?

06:17.638 --> 06:19.466
Yo, you're coming in loud
and clear, boss!

06:19.466 --> 06:21.032
Not exactly sure
what I'm looking at here.

06:21.032 --> 06:22.556
Just a bunch of numbers
falling down a screen,

06:22.556 --> 06:24.384
but I'm just gonna keep on
looking back and forth

06:24.384 --> 06:26.516
at these monitors
and randomly pressing stuff.

06:28.779 --> 06:31.521
The only way to counteract
the boner-killing effects

06:31.521 --> 06:33.610
of married life
is by introducing

06:33.610 --> 06:36.657
ever-more elaborate kinks
into the bedroom.

06:36.657 --> 06:39.573
But first, we're gonna
need dildos.

06:39.573 --> 06:41.618
Lots of dildos.

06:46.710 --> 06:48.538
Whoa.

06:48.538 --> 06:50.714
The simulation can manifest
your wildest fantasies

06:50.714 --> 06:52.586
simply by thinking of them.

06:52.586 --> 06:57.547
If things ever get too intense,
the safe word...

06:57.547 --> 06:58.983
is "boogie board."

06:58.983 --> 07:00.724
Yeah, I don't know.
I think this--

07:00.724 --> 07:02.378
this might be
just a little much for me.

07:02.378 --> 07:03.901
Maybe we start by just
lighting some candles or--

07:03.901 --> 07:05.337
or put on some
mood music?

07:05.337 --> 07:07.383
Smooth jazz
can be very kinky.

07:07.383 --> 07:09.646
Relax. This'll just be
silly and fun.

07:09.646 --> 07:11.692
Here, I'll go first.

07:13.128 --> 07:16.348
Help! Help!
He's gonna kill me!

07:18.394 --> 07:20.962
This is silly and fun?

07:20.962 --> 07:23.181
So I say to the guy,
"Watch it, pal.

07:23.181 --> 07:25.532
This suit costs more
than your car."

07:27.316 --> 07:28.752
Aww.

07:28.752 --> 07:30.972
Anybody want
another drink?

07:30.972 --> 07:34.366
I can afford it,
trust me.

07:34.366 --> 07:37.544
Ohh! Oh.

07:38.980 --> 07:43.463
Well, if it isn't
my old bully, Sean Bachman.

07:45.073 --> 07:49.599
Well, news flash, Sean--
I'm not Moaning Morris anymore.

07:49.599 --> 07:53.734
I'm a big success, and you're
just a big pile of bones.

07:53.734 --> 07:55.997
Yeah, words were never
your thing, were they?

07:55.997 --> 07:58.695
Well, let me put it in
language you'll understand.

08:00.392 --> 08:01.611
Ah!

08:01.611 --> 08:03.744
Noooo! D'oh!

08:03.744 --> 08:05.223
Don't look at me!

08:05.223 --> 08:08.618
No! Don't! Ow!

08:08.618 --> 08:10.141
Now I'm moaning.

08:10.141 --> 08:11.534
Moaning Morris!

08:11.534 --> 08:13.057
Oh, no!

08:15.495 --> 08:17.018
You monster.

08:17.018 --> 08:18.672
I'll never give you the
coordinates to the Oasis,

08:18.672 --> 08:20.935
no matter what you do
to my hot little body.

08:20.935 --> 08:23.807
God, no, Freya, I would
never dream of hurting you.

08:23.807 --> 08:24.765
I love you.

08:24.765 --> 08:26.723
No, Sid,
we're role-playing.

08:26.723 --> 08:28.420
I'm the helpless peasant,
and you're the evil mechanic.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.205
Now, I want you
to take control of me!

08:30.205 --> 08:32.120
Right. Uh...

08:32.120 --> 08:33.425
Okay.

08:33.425 --> 08:36.777
Yeah, I--
I'm a mean, scary guy.

08:36.777 --> 08:38.474
Yeah.

08:38.474 --> 08:41.390
I guess we're gonna have to do
this the hard way.

08:41.390 --> 08:43.435
Ay-yay-yay-
yay-yay-yay-yay!

08:43.435 --> 08:44.654
Oh, God!
Freya, I am so sorry!

08:44.654 --> 08:46.047
I did not realize
that was gonna do that!

08:46.047 --> 08:47.788
Oh. That was amazing.

08:47.788 --> 08:49.441
What?
Do it again.

08:49.441 --> 08:51.443
You liked that?
That-- That looked so painful.

08:51.443 --> 08:53.620
Sid, I'm not
some delicate flower, okay?

08:53.620 --> 08:55.186
I can handle it.

08:55.186 --> 08:56.797
Now I want you to zap me like
I'm a baked potato!

08:56.797 --> 09:00.801
Okay.
Um, uh, here I go.

09:02.106 --> 09:03.847
Ay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay!

09:03.847 --> 09:05.849
It's s-o-o g-o-o-o-ood!

09:05.849 --> 09:06.633
Yeah, it's fun
for me, too.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.852
Turn it u-u-u-u-up!

09:08.852 --> 09:10.680
Okay.

09:10.680 --> 09:11.768
Aaaa-whooooooooooooo!

09:11.768 --> 09:14.858
Oh, no, no,
I can't do this!

09:14.858 --> 09:16.991
I'm sorry! Boogie board!
Boogie board! Boogie board!

09:16.991 --> 09:18.688
Aww.

09:18.688 --> 09:20.821
Why'd you stop?
I was just about to explode.

09:20.821 --> 09:22.039
Yeah, Sid, what do you
have against

09:22.039 --> 09:23.127
giving your wife pleasure?

09:23.127 --> 09:24.564
No, no, that
wasn't pleasure.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.652
I can still smell
her hair burning.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.479
Are you really telling me
you've never had

09:27.479 --> 09:31.353
a single secret sexual fantasy
in your entire life?

09:32.963 --> 09:35.618
I mean, of course,
everyone's got something.

09:35.618 --> 09:37.489
Really?
You never told me.

09:37.489 --> 09:38.665
What is it?
No, I can't.

09:38.665 --> 09:40.057
It's not appropriate.

09:40.057 --> 09:41.755
You'll--
You'll think I'm weird.

09:41.755 --> 09:44.279
Sid, I love you, and I want
to make you happy.

09:44.279 --> 09:46.977
Okay, there's nothing you could
say that would turn me off.

09:46.977 --> 09:49.023
Please.

09:49.023 --> 09:50.546
You promise?

09:50.546 --> 09:51.852
I promise.

09:51.852 --> 09:53.418
I really want to hear.

09:53.418 --> 09:55.116
Okay.

09:56.900 --> 10:00.817
I am sexually attracted
to boulders.

10:00.817 --> 10:02.689
I'm sorry.
What was that?

10:02.689 --> 10:05.256
When I was a young
road wanderer,

10:05.256 --> 10:08.477
experiencing my first
sexual stirrings...

10:08.477 --> 10:09.565
Right.
...there weren't

10:09.565 --> 10:10.697
a lot of people around,

10:10.697 --> 10:13.700
but there were
a lot of boulders.

10:13.700 --> 10:18.487
And I think that I may have
accidentally projected

10:18.487 --> 10:21.882
some of my feelings on to...

10:21.882 --> 10:23.144
them.

10:23.144 --> 10:26.495
So, yeah.

10:26.495 --> 10:29.106
I'm horny for boulders.

10:29.106 --> 10:32.370
What the...

10:32.370 --> 10:35.852
Oh, that's--
that's great.

10:35.852 --> 10:37.724
Really?
Yeah.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.203
Yeah, boulders.

10:39.203 --> 10:41.118
I mean, that's--
that's sexy.

10:41.118 --> 10:42.990
- Right, Tai?
- Oh, no.

10:42.990 --> 10:44.513
I know this is supposed to be
a judgment-free zone,

10:44.513 --> 10:46.907
but your boy's a freak.

10:47.951 --> 10:49.910
Oh.

10:49.910 --> 10:52.390
Thanks for the ice.

10:52.390 --> 10:55.916
Serves me right for taking
a shot at you.

10:55.916 --> 10:58.919
You know, you're a really
good listener, Sean.

10:58.919 --> 11:00.790
I had you all wrong.

11:00.790 --> 11:03.097
Yeah, maybe I should put my old
grievances aside

11:03.097 --> 11:06.970
and move on with my life.

11:06.970 --> 11:08.972
To putting the past behind us.

11:13.194 --> 11:14.630
Say...

11:14.630 --> 11:16.458
is that Misty Sanders?

11:16.458 --> 11:18.982
Boy, I used to have
the biggest crush on her,

11:18.982 --> 11:20.897
but I never had the guts
to ask her out.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.945
What's that smile?
You think I should talk to her?

11:24.945 --> 11:27.861
You dog!

11:27.861 --> 11:29.950
All right.
I'm gonna do it.

11:29.950 --> 11:31.734
You dog.

11:39.568 --> 11:41.875
Hey, Misty?

11:41.875 --> 11:44.573
Uh, Morris Rubinstein.

11:44.573 --> 11:46.488
You probably don't remember me.

11:46.488 --> 11:49.143
I used to sit behind you
in math class.

11:49.143 --> 11:51.754
I almost failed algebra
because of you.

11:54.322 --> 11:55.540
Well, you haven't
slapped me yet.

11:55.540 --> 11:58.021
That's a good sign.

11:58.021 --> 12:02.634
Misty, would I be too bold
to ask you to dance?

12:05.986 --> 12:12.035
♪ Please just stay near ♪

12:15.822 --> 12:18.346
Honey, I'm home!

12:18.346 --> 12:20.565
Oh.

12:20.565 --> 12:22.306
Am I interrupting something?

12:22.306 --> 12:25.048
We've been waiting for you.

12:25.048 --> 12:26.658
Come join us.

12:26.658 --> 12:30.271
A boulder in
our marital bed.

12:30.271 --> 12:32.621
This feels so wrong.

12:32.621 --> 12:34.405
But also so right.

12:39.410 --> 12:41.630
Okay, now you two kiss.

12:41.630 --> 12:43.588
Oh. Um...

12:43.588 --> 12:45.416
okay.

12:47.941 --> 12:49.072
Oh, my God.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.815
Mmm, pebbly.

12:52.815 --> 12:55.426
Right.
Now let's triple kiss.

12:55.426 --> 12:56.863
Yeah.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.044
Oh, wow, this is so hot.

13:04.044 --> 13:06.002
Oh, you must weigh
a thousand tons.

13:06.002 --> 13:07.438
If you rolled down
a hillside,

13:07.438 --> 13:11.268
you would crush everything
in your path.

13:11.268 --> 13:13.444
Cool, cool.

13:13.444 --> 13:14.663
Oh, no.

13:14.663 --> 13:16.708
Horniness levels are plummeting.

13:21.104 --> 13:23.106
Not again.

13:23.106 --> 13:24.760
Hey, get back here!

13:24.760 --> 13:26.675
I'm gonna kill you!

13:26.675 --> 13:29.243
I want to free solo
you so bad.

13:29.243 --> 13:31.985
So I'm fully out of the scenario
at this point, right?

13:31.985 --> 13:34.117
- I'm just checking.
- I can't stand it any longer.

13:34.117 --> 13:35.945
I need you now.

13:37.294 --> 13:40.123
Oh, it's better than
I could've ever imagined.

13:40.123 --> 13:42.909
The boulder's surface
is so rough.

13:42.909 --> 13:45.694
There's not even a hole.
I am just smashing my dick

13:45.694 --> 13:48.044
against the hard
boulder surface.

13:48.044 --> 13:49.393
That's it.
Boogie board!

13:49.393 --> 13:51.047
A million times
boogie board!

13:51.047 --> 13:52.483
Boulder-- Aah!

13:52.483 --> 13:54.268
Nope. Nope.
That was too messed up.

13:54.268 --> 13:57.575
Hey, don't kink-shame me!
I feel vulnerable right now.

13:57.575 --> 13:59.186
Well, that was the freakiest
shit I've ever seen!

13:59.186 --> 14:00.796
Wait.
My thing was freaky?

14:00.796 --> 14:03.103
At least I didn't want to be
actually tortured!

14:03.103 --> 14:07.063
I am loving this open
and honest communication.

14:07.063 --> 14:09.936
I feel like we're on the verge
of a major breakthrough.

14:09.936 --> 14:12.895
Shut up, Tai! This sucks.
I don't want to do this anymore.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.201
Yeah, this has been
a complete disaster.

14:14.201 --> 14:16.159
- Get us out of here.
- All right, geez.

14:16.159 --> 14:19.119
If you want to give up
on your relationship forever.

14:19.119 --> 14:21.077
Scraps, give us an exit.

14:23.819 --> 14:25.081
<i>Scraps?</i>

14:25.081 --> 14:26.909
Just get back here!

14:26.909 --> 14:28.998
Get back here!
I'll kill you!

14:28.998 --> 14:32.045
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!

14:32.654 --> 14:34.003
Huh.

14:34.003 --> 14:36.614
- Tai?
- Hmm?

14:36.614 --> 14:41.402
Did you trap us in
a computer prison forever?

14:41.402 --> 14:43.360
S-Sorry.
What was that?

14:43.360 --> 14:45.972
I'm-- I'm just gonna
go check on that.

14:45.972 --> 14:47.799
Yeah, I'm here.

14:52.195 --> 14:56.025
Oh, Misty, you make me feel
like I'm 16 again,

14:56.025 --> 14:59.159
dancing with
the prettiest girl in school.

15:01.509 --> 15:05.165
Oh, what are you doing to me?

15:05.165 --> 15:07.819
I'm a married man.

15:09.212 --> 15:12.215
This is crazy.

15:12.215 --> 15:16.132
Oh, hell, let's be crazy.

15:16.132 --> 15:17.655
♪ I'm holding out for love ♪

15:17.655 --> 15:22.878
♪ The reason the sun comes up ♪

15:22.878 --> 15:25.794
♪ Your the life ♪

15:25.794 --> 15:29.145
Whoa! Oh, Misty!
I love you!

15:31.887 --> 15:37.197
I spy with my little eye
something white.

15:37.197 --> 15:40.417
What's the matter?
You don't want to play anymore?

15:40.417 --> 15:42.680
I'm sad about
our relationship.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.294
So that's it?

15:47.294 --> 15:49.078
We're just gonna become one of
those sexless couples,

15:49.078 --> 15:50.601
like Tai said?

15:50.601 --> 15:53.300
Who go on boring date nights
at the Boomtown Bistro?

15:53.300 --> 15:55.171
Ugh, no.
Can you imagine?

15:55.171 --> 15:58.261
"Uh, hey, let's make time out of
our already very busy lives

15:58.261 --> 16:00.046
to go just hang out
with each other

16:00.046 --> 16:02.439
in a different place
that isn't our house."

16:02.439 --> 16:04.311
"I'll put on
my nice top,

16:04.311 --> 16:06.052
even though you've literally
seen me naked a thousand times."

16:06.052 --> 16:09.098
"Yeah, and I'll put
on my one nice shirt."

16:09.098 --> 16:11.448
Aw, you haven't worn
that shirt in forever.

16:11.448 --> 16:13.233
- It looks nice on you.
- Thanks.

16:13.233 --> 16:14.974
You look so pretty.

16:16.497 --> 16:18.281
Bet the bar
would be stupid.

16:18.281 --> 16:20.109
Oh, yeah, for sure.

16:22.938 --> 16:25.114
Though is does create
a nice ambiance.

16:25.114 --> 16:26.289
It is really pleasant.

16:26.289 --> 16:28.161
Thank you, thank you.

16:28.161 --> 16:30.076
That one was called,
"I Ate My Baby."

16:30.076 --> 16:31.686
Bet the cocktails
have stupid names,

16:31.686 --> 16:35.124
like "Wasteland Punch"
and "Atomic Apple-Tini."

16:35.124 --> 16:37.126
Although, that one does
look really good.

16:37.126 --> 16:38.345
Should we get one?
Ooh!

16:38.345 --> 16:40.129
It's still happy hour.
Drinks are half off.

16:40.129 --> 16:42.305
Well, then we
should get two.

16:42.305 --> 16:44.655
Sid, you're bad.

16:44.655 --> 16:46.657
I know.

16:46.657 --> 16:49.138
God, stupid mailman.

16:49.138 --> 16:51.314
Almost had him.

16:51.314 --> 16:54.143
What the-- This can't be right.

16:54.143 --> 16:55.753
The horniness levels...

16:57.799 --> 16:58.843
...they're rising.

16:58.843 --> 17:00.149
Okay.

17:00.149 --> 17:03.109
This date night is kind of
doing it for me.

17:03.109 --> 17:04.762
Should we...?

17:04.762 --> 17:06.329
You know.

17:06.329 --> 17:08.679
Freya, we're in the middle
of a wine bar.

17:08.679 --> 17:11.117
Sid, none of this is real.

17:11.117 --> 17:13.075
We're in a simulation.

17:13.075 --> 17:15.121
Oh, yeah.

17:15.121 --> 17:16.948
I forgot.

17:22.171 --> 17:23.520
They're doing it.

17:32.355 --> 17:33.965
It's beautiful.

17:36.794 --> 17:38.361
- Sexy.
- Who's your daddy?

17:38.361 --> 17:39.754
- Oh, you're my daddy!
- Who's your daddy?

17:39.754 --> 17:41.103
- You're my daddy!
- Whoo!

17:41.103 --> 17:42.887
Go, Mom and Dad!

17:45.368 --> 17:47.979
Oh. You know,
I don't understand this--

17:47.979 --> 17:50.156
I don't understand this one.

17:50.156 --> 17:52.593
Woop!
Ho-ho! Sacre bleu!

17:52.593 --> 17:54.595
Hold on to your butts,
Mom and Dad.

17:54.595 --> 17:57.250
You're coming home.

18:00.992 --> 18:03.778
No! Not like this!

18:03.778 --> 18:05.910
Hi.

18:05.910 --> 18:07.390
There, there.

18:07.390 --> 18:10.219
Okay, let me go
grab you a towel.

18:10.219 --> 18:12.178
Thanks.

18:12.178 --> 18:14.397
Ugh!
You had a date night?

18:14.397 --> 18:16.443
It was actually really fun.
There was live music.

18:16.443 --> 18:17.835
Ugh!
Great atmosphere.

18:17.835 --> 18:19.576
- Ugh!
- And the shishito peppers.

18:19.576 --> 18:21.361
The shishito peppers.

18:21.361 --> 18:23.232
- Oh, my God.
- Nom nom nom.

18:23.232 --> 18:26.757
I need to wipe my hard drive
to erase this memory.

18:26.757 --> 18:28.411
I feel sick.

18:29.717 --> 18:31.240
You are my little
shishito pepper.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.068
You're my little
shishito pepper.

18:33.068 --> 18:34.852
Nom nom nom
nom nom nom nom!

18:34.852 --> 18:37.420
Hey, lovebirds.
Beautiful day, ain't she?

18:37.420 --> 18:39.118
Hey, Mr Rubinstein!
Oh!

18:39.118 --> 18:40.554
So, did you end up
rubbing your success

18:40.554 --> 18:41.642
in your classmates' faces?

18:41.642 --> 18:43.426
No, I'm beyond all that.

18:43.426 --> 18:45.428
I was able to put the past
in the past.

18:45.428 --> 18:48.431
I caught up with friends,
patched up old grievances,

18:48.431 --> 18:51.260
had sex with a skeleton,
and danced our butts off--

18:51.260 --> 18:52.827
Sorry.
You did what?

18:52.827 --> 18:54.263
Danced our butts off.

18:54.263 --> 18:57.005
Honestly, Sid,
try and keep up sometime.

18:57.005 --> 19:00.443
Well, anyway, I should probably
get home to my loving wife.

19:00.443 --> 19:02.228
I'll see you at work.

19:04.317 --> 19:05.622
Hmm.

19:05.622 --> 19:06.623
That guy is your mentor.

19:06.623 --> 19:08.147
Yes, he is.

19:12.325 --> 19:13.369
Oh, hi, honey.

19:13.369 --> 19:15.545
Hey!

19:15.545 --> 19:17.112
Mwah.

19:17.112 --> 19:19.593
The kids will be here any minute
to celebrate your birthday.

19:19.593 --> 19:21.421
Okay. Just need to get
these shoes off.

19:21.421 --> 19:23.205
My dogs
are killing me.

19:45.967 --> 19:47.621
Told you I'd kill you.

19:47.621 --> 19:50.145
Honey!
The kids are here!
