WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:03.379
Previously on "The Originals"...

00:03.380 --> 00:05.976
I assume I have the misfortune
of speaking to my mother.

00:05.977 --> 00:07.616
I have come to heal our family.

00:07.617 --> 00:10.038
I will undo everything
that has been done,

00:10.039 --> 00:12.200
thereby giving you a new life.

00:12.201 --> 00:15.013
Well, I'd prefer you both to
join me against our mother,

00:15.014 --> 00:16.996
but I'll happily settle
for one or the other.

00:16.997 --> 00:19.113
I will not stop
until every single vampire

00:19.114 --> 00:21.233
in New Orleans has
ceased to exist,

00:21.234 --> 00:23.507
and I will show
no mercy to anyone

00:23.508 --> 00:24.956
who dares stand with them.

00:24.957 --> 00:26.992
My wolves...
I think I figured out

00:26.993 --> 00:29.233
a way to release them
from the witches.

00:29.937 --> 00:32.164
I have to marry Jackson.

00:34.734 --> 00:35.892
Rebekah: Hello, mother.

00:35.893 --> 00:37.261
I believe you're
offering a deal.

00:37.262 --> 00:38.965
Your beautiful soul will live on

00:38.966 --> 00:40.535
in the body of another.

00:42.575 --> 00:44.534
You must be feeling
a little twitchy.

00:44.535 --> 00:46.351
That's what happens
when you're in transition.

00:46.967 --> 00:48.541
I couldn't stop the spell.

00:48.542 --> 00:50.302
Davina: You swear she's safe?

00:50.303 --> 00:51.260
Perfectly.

00:51.261 --> 00:52.481
[Gasps]

00:55.015 --> 00:57.094
I'm Rebekah Mikaelson!

01:00.564 --> 01:02.497
Hi, honey.
Mama's here.

01:02.498 --> 01:04.069
Ohh.

01:04.071 --> 01:06.140
Klaus, voice-over: It has been
said that all love begins

01:06.141 --> 01:10.050
and ends with she
who gave us life.

01:10.051 --> 01:12.124
A thousand years ago,
my mother turned us

01:12.125 --> 01:13.925
into monsters,

01:13.926 --> 01:17.330
yet still she claimed
to love her children,

01:17.331 --> 01:20.200
even as she vowed to destroy us.

01:24.479 --> 01:26.785
The noble Elijah,

01:26.786 --> 01:31.193
tormented by long buried,
shameful secrets.

01:31.194 --> 01:32.307
Aah! Aah!

01:36.734 --> 01:38.396
[Shudders]

01:40.973 --> 01:43.795
Kol, the wily troublemaker...

01:46.514 --> 01:50.058
Out for no one but himself.

01:50.059 --> 01:52.534
Finn,

01:52.535 --> 01:54.573
the devoted acolyte,

01:54.574 --> 01:56.709
his love all too easily warped

01:56.710 --> 01:59.112
by our mother's sick hate.

02:03.489 --> 02:06.144
Fierce Rebekah,

02:06.145 --> 02:07.904
willing to risk everything
on the chance

02:07.905 --> 02:12.479
that she might one day
find happiness,

02:12.480 --> 02:16.655
and me, the bastard child,

02:16.656 --> 02:19.559
my mother's greatest shame.

02:19.560 --> 02:22.274
Now finally, we have
defeated her,

02:22.732 --> 02:27.075
giving her the choice
she never thought to give us,

02:27.076 --> 02:32.588
to live on as one
of the monsters she created

02:32.589 --> 02:34.958
or suffer the slow,
agonizing death

02:34.959 --> 02:36.930
she so deserves.

02:36.931 --> 02:38.760
Um, congratulations, I guess,

02:38.761 --> 02:42.275
but right now,
I'm a little more worried about Finn,

02:42.276 --> 02:44.599
considering I totally
stabbed him in the back.

02:44.600 --> 02:46.082
He won't find you here.

02:46.083 --> 02:49.356
This is the safest place
you could possibly be.

02:49.357 --> 02:52.137
Come on. There's someone
I want you to meet.

02:56.292 --> 02:57.706
I'd like to introduce you

02:57.707 --> 03:00.611
to the newest member
of our family,

03:00.612 --> 03:03.750
the little troublemaker all
the fuss has been about.

03:03.751 --> 03:04.853
Camille...

03:04.854 --> 03:06.121
[Door opens]

03:06.122 --> 03:08.394
This is hope.

03:09.899 --> 03:12.202
Oh, my God.

03:12.203 --> 03:15.130
What? You said...
I thought she was...

03:15.131 --> 03:16.603
The only way
to truly protect her

03:16.604 --> 03:18.705
was to convince
the world of her death.

03:21.143 --> 03:23.380
I hope you understand

03:23.381 --> 03:24.715
once it's safe
for you to leave here,

03:24.716 --> 03:27.422
our secret cannot
leave with you.

She's perfect.

03:40.761 --> 03:43.065
Ha ha.

03:43.066 --> 03:44.570
Now that we've
entombed our mother,

03:44.571 --> 03:47.287
I intend to finish making
the city safe for hope,

03:47.288 --> 03:48.604
which to start means dealing

03:48.605 --> 03:50.973
with the lingering
problem of Finn.

03:50.974 --> 03:52.577
Oh. Once he figures out what
you've done to your mother,

03:52.578 --> 03:54.294
he's gonna go off the deep end.

03:54.295 --> 03:57.084
That's exactly why we need to
keep you out of harm's way.

03:57.085 --> 03:58.717
Hayley and I will return home

03:58.718 --> 04:00.385
and take care of
my wayward brother.

04:00.386 --> 04:03.792
Elijah will remain
here with you.

04:03.793 --> 04:06.139
He's been experiencing
some side effects

04:06.140 --> 04:08.435
since his ordeal
as our mother's captive.

04:08.436 --> 04:10.977
Best he stay and convalesce.

04:10.978 --> 04:12.204
A single violent outburst

04:12.205 --> 04:13.536
at a filthy roadside cafe,

04:13.537 --> 04:15.937
and one never hears
the end of it.

04:15.938 --> 04:19.476
Well, Cami has a way with minds
plagued by demons, brother.

04:19.476 --> 04:21.184
You two can bond.

04:21.616 --> 04:22.851
Well, if you'll excuse me,

04:22.852 --> 04:24.419
I best be on my way.

04:24.420 --> 04:26.221
Rebekah should have
already woken up

04:26.222 --> 04:27.657
in the body of angelica barker.

04:27.658 --> 04:29.225
Once she has cut the ties
with Ms. Barker's

04:29.226 --> 04:32.097
former life,
she'll make her way directly here.

04:32.098 --> 04:34.265
You should expect her shortly.

04:36.392 --> 04:39.238
[Panting]

04:39.239 --> 04:41.633
You have no bloody idea
who you're dealing with!

If they've harmed her...-

05:30.134 --> 05:31.703
Esther's mistake was believing

05:31.704 --> 05:34.674
there was anything left
in your siblings to save.

05:37.109 --> 05:42.360
Together, my son,

05:42.361 --> 05:44.392
we can finally destroy them.

05:47.059 --> 05:49.439
I'm happy to hear
you say this, father.

05:51.050 --> 05:54.028

05:54.029 --> 05:56.228

for meeting me here.

06:11.437 --> 06:14.675
I ask you to marry me,
you take off for 3 days.

06:14.676 --> 06:18.411
Good thing I'm
a secure guy... sort of.

06:18.412 --> 06:21.549
So you ready to do this thing,

06:21.550 --> 06:24.083
get hitched, take the plunge,

06:24.084 --> 06:25.737
slap on the old ball and chain?

06:25.738 --> 06:27.881
Whoa. It's not that simple.

06:27.882 --> 06:30.281
It's a mystical
unification ceremony.

06:30.282 --> 06:32.150
It's not like we can
just go to Vegas.

06:32.151 --> 06:34.988
Right.

06:34.989 --> 06:37.791
Look. As long
as the werewolves need those rings,

06:37.792 --> 06:39.459
they'll be under
the witches' control.

06:39.460 --> 06:41.252
Now if we want to change that,

06:41.253 --> 06:43.421
we got to do this
by the book literally.

06:43.422 --> 06:46.799
We have to find a shaman
who can perform the ceremony,

06:46.800 --> 06:49.299
trials to endure,
devotion rituals.

06:49.300 --> 06:51.868
Devotion rituals?

06:51.869 --> 06:53.848
Heh. Try not to sound
too excited.

06:53.849 --> 06:57.810
I'm sorry.
This just all sounds very, um...

06:57.811 --> 06:59.338
Intimate?

06:59.339 --> 07:03.691
Yeah. It's a marriage.

07:03.692 --> 07:08.011
Look. I know we're kind
of diving into this thing,

07:08.012 --> 07:11.282
but I think it's cool.

07:11.283 --> 07:14.357
I'm looking forward to
the getting to know you part...

07:16.562 --> 07:18.445

Aiden rounded up
the most influential wolves

07:38.157 --> 07:39.324
so they could talk.

07:39.325 --> 07:42.225
About what?

07:42.226 --> 07:43.386
About them.

08:27.545 --> 08:28.711

08:28.712 --> 08:32.488
No one believed me, but you do.

08:32.489 --> 08:33.655
Why?

08:33.657 --> 08:35.818
I know a little bit
about Mikaelsons

08:35.818 --> 08:38.620
jumping into other
people's bodies,

08:38.621 --> 08:42.111
mostly because
your mother did it to me.

08:49.766 --> 08:51.600
So you must be
that harvest girl.

08:51.601 --> 08:53.735
Cassie, is it?

08:53.736 --> 08:55.553
I'm in a bit of a bind here,

08:55.554 --> 08:57.675
so tell me how exactly does one

08:57.676 --> 08:59.474
go about breaking
out of this joint?

08:59.475 --> 09:02.145
You can't break out.

09:02.146 --> 09:04.947
Once you're in,
there's no leaving this place.

09:04.948 --> 09:06.581
That's ridiculous.

09:06.582 --> 09:08.049
Surely someone's gotten out.

09:08.050 --> 09:11.015
Sure but not alive.

09:26.811 --> 09:30.251
Settling in to your
new accommodations?

09:30.252 --> 09:32.655
Well, I would have
preferred me own room,

09:32.656 --> 09:34.523
but seeing as it's filled
with a dusty nursery

09:34.524 --> 09:38.304
and a hybrid,
thought it best not to complain.

09:38.305 --> 09:40.086
I brought you something

09:40.595 --> 09:42.863
in honor of your
return to the fold.

09:42.864 --> 09:44.765
I believe it's your favorite,

- You feeling all right?
- Don't make me ask again.

10:12.471 --> 10:14.808
Well, I assume you're
referring to our mother.

10:14.809 --> 10:18.720
Fear not. She's tucked away
somewhere perfectly safe.

10:18.721 --> 10:20.430
You'll never find her.

10:20.431 --> 10:22.849
You think you've won.

10:22.850 --> 10:25.988
Let's see how long that
arrogance lasts, brother.

10:32.706 --> 10:35.194
Hayley: You wolves are here
because you want freedom,

10:35.195 --> 10:38.489
and I promise you if you
stay you will be free,

10:38.490 --> 10:41.975
but we need as much
help as we can get.

10:41.976 --> 10:43.143
My vamps and I
are willing to stand

10:43.144 --> 10:44.829
with you against the witches.

10:44.830 --> 10:46.956
In return, all I want
is a promise,

10:46.957 --> 10:49.319
that there will be peace between
our sides after the wedding.

10:49.320 --> 10:50.655
You're the one who spent
the last 100 years

10:50.656 --> 10:52.420
killing and cursing us.

10:52.421 --> 10:53.727
Which means you might
want to listen

10:53.728 --> 10:55.598
to what I have to say.

10:55.599 --> 10:59.069
I see you're
brokering a truce...

10:59.070 --> 11:04.056
Between mongrels and parasites.

11:04.057 --> 11:06.184
Now just how long do you
really think that's gonna last?

11:06.185 --> 11:07.894
A month, a week, a day?

11:07.895 --> 11:09.678
What you don't yet
seem to understand

11:09.679 --> 11:11.378
is that the only thing
that can exist

11:11.379 --> 11:13.877
between your two
degenerate species

11:13.878 --> 11:17.236
is hatred, war, and death.

[Rumbling]

11:26.510 --> 11:28.215

11:31.014 --> 11:33.821
But I imagine given
a little time

11:33.822 --> 11:36.388
confined together

11:36.389 --> 11:39.490
that you'll come to see
things the way I do.

11:51.952 --> 11:55.608
[Sizzle]

11:55.609 --> 11:57.883
Did he really just
trap us all in here?

11:57.884 --> 11:59.350
He certainly did, which means

11:59.351 --> 12:01.364
we have a witch problem.

12:01.365 --> 12:03.866
You're a witch.
Fix it.

12:03.867 --> 12:05.119

the bloody hell do you

12:05.120 --> 12:06.320
want me to do about it?

12:06.321 --> 12:08.055
Well, considering the crowd,

12:08.056 --> 12:09.891
I think you'd be more
motivated to find a solution.

12:09.892 --> 12:11.627
After all, I can easily
outwait our brother's antics.

12:11.628 --> 12:13.295
You on the other hand
might find yourself

12:13.296 --> 12:17.565
looking rather appetizing to
some of our fellow prisoners.

12:17.566 --> 12:19.036
I'm gonna need some help.

12:22.524 --> 12:24.073
Josh and Aiden
are gonna check doors,

12:24.074 --> 12:25.507
windows, any other entrance.

12:25.508 --> 12:27.598
Maybe he missed something

12:27.599 --> 12:30.348
can you get them to manage
this guy Jerick's attitude?

12:30.349 --> 12:32.451
Gia, I want you to do
two things for me.

12:32.452 --> 12:33.886
Yeah?

12:33.887 --> 12:35.988
First, knock it off
with the tough girl routine.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.289
I'm serious.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.459
Don't underestimate
those wolves.

12:39.460 --> 12:40.729
All right. You're new,
but they have

12:40.730 --> 12:42.560
a long list of reasons
to hate us.

12:43.033 --> 12:45.834
Sorry. You're right.
What's the second?

12:45.835 --> 12:47.868
I want you to help
watch our guys, all right,

12:47.869 --> 12:50.151
make sure nobody starts
looking for trouble.

12:56.945 --> 12:59.081
So you got any brilliant ideas

12:59.082 --> 13:01.549
on how to keep
this under control?

13:01.550 --> 13:03.086
What people in new
Orleans have always done

13:03.087 --> 13:04.289
when trapped in close quarters

13:04.290 --> 13:06.894
with mortal enemies...

13:06.895 --> 13:09.663
Drink and hopefully
blow off a little steam.

13:13.575 --> 13:15.802
Ahh.

13:17.287 --> 13:20.450
Rebekah, it's me again.

13:20.451 --> 13:22.921
Please call.

13:22.922 --> 13:24.660
Yahtzee! Ha ha!

13:24.661 --> 13:26.496
If there's one thing
I've learned about you people

13:26.497 --> 13:28.599
it's that there's always
a bottle of booze around.

13:28.600 --> 13:29.834
You want one?

13:29.835 --> 13:31.287
Sounds delightful,

13:31.288 --> 13:33.110
and after that,
Camille, then what?

13:33.573 --> 13:35.542
We have another, then another,

13:35.543 --> 13:37.878
perhaps another after that,
another after that?

13:37.879 --> 13:40.913
Before long,
I find myself opening up to you

13:40.914 --> 13:45.651
or bearing my damaged soul,
as it were?

13:45.652 --> 13:48.179
It's an old trick, Camille,

13:48.180 --> 13:50.264
not a particularly clever one.

13:50.265 --> 13:52.822
You mother really did a number
on you boys, didn't she?

13:52.823 --> 13:54.257
Has it ever occurred
to you that I am

13:54.258 --> 13:56.395
less interested
in fixing your problems

13:56.396 --> 13:58.731
and more interested
in forgetting my own?

13:58.732 --> 14:00.030
I mean, I'm basically

14:00.031 --> 14:02.331
in a supernatural
witness protection program

14:02.332 --> 14:04.403
because your psychotic
brother, who by the way

14:04.404 --> 14:06.906
I practically had to seduce,
wants me dead,

14:06.907 --> 14:09.200
so, yeah...

14:09.201 --> 14:11.567
Booze and board games
is pretty much

14:11.568 --> 14:14.271
where I'm at right now.

14:14.272 --> 14:15.915
Here's a question.

14:15.916 --> 14:17.959
"What was the name
of don quixote's horse?"

14:17.960 --> 14:19.210
This is absurd.

14:19.211 --> 14:22.847
Fine. Dumb idea.

14:22.848 --> 14:25.351
How's Hayley?
You two seemed close.

14:28.021 --> 14:31.055
Rocinante.

14:31.056 --> 14:35.339
The horse's name is rocinante.

14:37.159 --> 14:39.510
[Indistinct chatter]

14:47.740 --> 14:50.579
Worried about your wolves,

14:50.580 --> 14:52.181
or perhaps the source
of your anxiety

14:52.182 --> 14:53.649
is a little further from home.

14:53.650 --> 14:55.885
How is Elijah, by the way?

14:55.886 --> 14:57.999
I'm sure he found
your visit most curative.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.059
Eww! No.

15:03.393 --> 15:05.035
That obvious, huh?
Ahem.

15:05.036 --> 15:06.572
Well, you both had
a certain glow

15:06.573 --> 15:08.074
about you all morning.

15:08.075 --> 15:09.242
Frankly, I'm glad
the two of you dropped

15:09.243 --> 15:11.279
your pretenses, and, uh,

15:11.280 --> 15:13.112
shall we say, let
the spirit move you.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.046
Ok, ok, ok.

15:15.047 --> 15:17.149
Stop. Enough.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.318
This family's weird
enough already.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.781
You're feeling
guilty, aren't you,

15:30.782 --> 15:33.075
wondering if you should
tell your betrothed

15:33.076 --> 15:35.136
things he doesn't need to know.

15:39.179 --> 15:42.283
For all the poems written on
the subject of unrequited love,

15:42.284 --> 15:43.586
there are so few on the pain

15:43.587 --> 15:46.923
of being the object
of that affection.

15:46.924 --> 15:50.460
The truth is, Hayley,
it's not love

15:50.461 --> 15:54.334
on which the strongest
foundations are built.

15:54.335 --> 15:58.089
It's the decency
of merciful lies.

16:02.815 --> 16:04.585
They say this place is haunted.

16:04.586 --> 16:06.920
How could you possibly tell?

16:06.921 --> 16:08.321
There's lots of
versions of the story,

16:08.322 --> 16:11.072
but they all start the same way

16:11.073 --> 16:14.658
with Astrid Malchance
and Mary-Alice Claire,

16:14.659 --> 16:17.078
imprisoned here
over a century ago

16:17.079 --> 16:19.474
by your brother.

16:19.475 --> 16:21.791
Then the coven started
to put others here, too,

16:21.792 --> 16:25.515
ones broken by magic,
witches like me.

16:25.516 --> 16:26.817
So that's it then?
They just lock

16:26.818 --> 16:28.752
you lot up
and throw away the key?

16:28.753 --> 16:30.254
Woman: Wait!
I didn't!

16:30.255 --> 16:33.821
No! No! Nooo!

16:35.861 --> 16:37.824
Who are the creeps
with the scars?

16:37.825 --> 16:41.159
They call themselves
the kindred.

16:41.160 --> 16:44.834
Years ago, they got
obsessed with dark magic,

16:44.835 --> 16:48.737
necromancy, immortality spells.

16:48.738 --> 16:51.206
So their coven locked
them up here.

16:51.207 --> 16:56.217
Since then,
they kind of put themselves in charge.

16:56.218 --> 16:57.551
What about our magic then?

16:57.552 --> 16:59.233
We're still witches, right?

17:03.263 --> 17:06.449
All we need to do is send
a little distress signal.

we're all free to go.

17:55.182 --> 17:57.450
No. The spell's locking us out.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.286
Vincent must be
channeling something,

17:59.287 --> 18:01.421
a dark object maybe.

18:03.198 --> 18:05.459
Oh, you should have seen them.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.062
They were so...

18:07.063 --> 18:10.133
They were so confident
in our defeat.

18:18.672 --> 18:21.118
But I assure you, father,

18:21.119 --> 18:24.346
they have no idea
what they're up against now.

to know that.

dialing the wrong number.

Forgive me.

gonna like it, though.

20:11.521 --> 20:14.286
There are things
that we need from Lycee,

20:14.287 --> 20:16.220
which means we
need it clear of Finn,

20:16.221 --> 20:17.621
and knowing him,
there's only one thing

20:17.622 --> 20:19.903
that will distract him
for long enough.

And what's that?

Yes. Uh, no.

25:13.118 --> 25:14.384
hasn't yet sapped your humor,

25:14.385 --> 25:16.116
but I should warn you, brother,

25:16.117 --> 25:19.119
if those vampires
even attempt to feed

25:19.120 --> 25:21.260
they'll find
themselves ravenous,

25:21.261 --> 25:22.664
unable to stop,

25:22.665 --> 25:24.958
so every moment
that you waste with me

25:24.959 --> 25:28.631
will only lead you
to the inevitable carnage.

25:35.776 --> 25:37.611
Esther for our freedom.

25:37.612 --> 25:40.379
Do we have a deal?

25:40.380 --> 25:43.051
Well, I think I know better
than to trust your honesty,

25:43.052 --> 25:48.262
but, yes, if I find
our mother unharmed,

25:48.263 --> 25:52.599
then I might consider
granting your reprieve.

25:52.600 --> 25:56.603
St. Roch number one,
the delphine tomb.

26:05.087 --> 26:06.456
Rebekah: All we
have to do is just pop

26:06.457 --> 26:08.168
this message off to my brothers.

26:08.169 --> 26:09.697
Give me your hands
and lead the way.

26:09.698 --> 26:11.099
I don't know what I'm doing.

26:11.100 --> 26:12.767
I... I can't.

26:12.768 --> 26:14.167
The pills they give us
are lobelia flower.

26:14.168 --> 26:16.551
It makes it impossible
to concentrate.

26:16.552 --> 26:18.136
No one can do much magic here.

26:18.137 --> 26:19.543
You're a harvest girl
for God's sake!

26:19.544 --> 26:21.512
Now pull yourself together!

26:28.214 --> 26:30.440
Pran ce mesaj sa a,

26:30.441 --> 26:32.192

26:32.193 --> 26:34.325

26:34.326 --> 26:36.028

26:36.029 --> 26:38.130
Pran ce mesaj sa a,

26:38.131 --> 26:39.783

26:39.784 --> 26:41.356

26:43.238 --> 26:44.706

27:01.027 --> 27:02.128
Watch it.

27:02.129 --> 27:03.230
[Growling]

27:03.231 --> 27:04.631
Gia: Hey!

27:08.826 --> 27:10.740
Things are getting
testy out there.

27:10.741 --> 27:12.243
Come on. We better
move this along.

27:12.244 --> 27:14.545
Vincent's boundary
is too strong,

27:14.546 --> 27:16.614
but what Davina and I can do is

27:16.615 --> 27:18.238
cast a disruption spell.

27:18.239 --> 27:19.853
It would temporarily neutralize

27:19.854 --> 27:21.557
all magical objects
in this compound,

27:21.558 --> 27:23.629
including the compound itself.

27:23.630 --> 27:24.745
If it works,

27:24.746 --> 27:26.864
well, then it would
give us 60 seconds

27:26.865 --> 27:28.564
to escape whilst
the boundary is shut down.

27:28.565 --> 27:31.033
All right, all right.
That sounds good to me.

27:31.034 --> 27:32.201
If the spell works,
it will suppress

27:32.202 --> 27:33.737
all magical objects
in the vicinity.

27:33.738 --> 27:35.077
That means your rings.

27:35.575 --> 27:36.943
And if we go out in the sun
without our rings,

27:36.944 --> 27:38.111
we're dead.

27:38.112 --> 27:39.646
Unless you wait till nightfall.

27:39.647 --> 27:41.208
Gah.

27:43.786 --> 27:45.758
They're all so new.

27:45.759 --> 27:47.628
They're not gonna
be able to fight hunger.

27:47.629 --> 27:49.311
We can't wait until nightfall.

27:49.312 --> 27:50.731
We're gonna have
a bloodbath on our hands

27:50.732 --> 27:52.498
before we even get close.

27:54.872 --> 27:57.672
[Breathing heavily]

28:06.175 --> 28:07.987

28:10.958 --> 28:13.157
Elijah, are you ok?

28:13.158 --> 28:16.524
Hey. I know you're
worried about Rebekah.

28:18.929 --> 28:20.231
Elijah.

28:20.232 --> 28:21.885
Elijah, please calm down.

28:21.886 --> 28:23.750
Elijah, please calm down.

28:40.876 --> 28:43.016

28:59.228 --> 29:01.079
Aah!

29:06.205 --> 29:08.172
She was just here.

29:08.173 --> 29:09.641
No. You don't understand.

29:09.642 --> 29:11.510
There was someone in my room.

29:11.511 --> 29:12.813
There was... look.
Just listen to me, ok?

29:12.814 --> 29:14.885
There was a girl,
a girl in black.

29:15.882 --> 29:17.516
She hasn't been
taking her pills.

29:17.517 --> 29:19.718
No. Unh!

29:19.719 --> 29:22.392
Aah!

29:26.522 --> 29:28.482
Ugh. That's disgusting.

29:39.400 --> 29:41.367
Here's hoping you're
a friendly ghost.

29:50.145 --> 29:51.391
Mother?

29:51.392 --> 29:55.316
I thought for sure
I'd find you dead.

29:55.317 --> 29:58.488
I've come to save you.

29:58.489 --> 30:00.901
I knew you would,

30:00.902 --> 30:02.788
my sweet child.

30:13.905 --> 30:15.238
No.

30:25.732 --> 30:27.489
Jerick: What the hell
are you looking at?

30:27.490 --> 30:28.857
You want a piece of me?

31:04.503 --> 31:06.746
You get away from him right now.

31:08.713 --> 31:11.001
Davina, start the spell!

31:29.712 --> 31:32.188
Stu... stupid human body.

32:12.147 --> 32:14.684
[Footsteps]

32:24.642 --> 32:27.577
I'm sorry.
I-I'll go willingly.

32:31.232 --> 32:33.870
Finn, please.
I fought it

32:33.871 --> 32:37.682
for as long as I could.

32:37.683 --> 32:39.225
Look at me.

32:39.226 --> 32:42.313
I am still your mother.

32:45.246 --> 32:47.520
I'm sorry.

32:47.521 --> 32:51.643
I was just so hungry.

32:53.966 --> 32:55.981
You're a hypocrite.

32:56.402 --> 32:59.122
You speak of purification,

32:59.218 --> 33:02.540
of cleansing the souls
of our family,

33:02.541 --> 33:04.714
and yet you cave
to temptation rather

33:04.715 --> 33:06.866
than standing
with your principles?

33:09.103 --> 33:11.341
It was your morality, mother,

33:11.342 --> 33:13.259
your conviction that awed me.

33:13.260 --> 33:14.803
That's why I stood by you.

33:14.804 --> 33:18.296
That's why I fought for you!

33:18.297 --> 33:23.569
I would have done anything for you,
my mother,

33:23.570 --> 33:26.147
she who gave me life.

33:26.148 --> 33:27.357
Yes.

33:27.358 --> 33:29.579
But I know

33:29.580 --> 33:33.196
that she would want from me

33:33.197 --> 33:35.623
to finish what we started.

33:35.624 --> 33:37.093
Aah!

33:37.094 --> 33:40.483
[Both chanting]

33:50.644 --> 33:52.514

33:55.399 --> 33:57.208
Ok. Jack, now!

Go, go.

Aah.

34:17.505 --> 34:19.541
Slight change of plans, brother.

34:21.606 --> 34:23.141
I no longer have to
treat you like anything

34:23.141 --> 34:26.696
but the treacherous
liar you truly are.

34:27.143 --> 34:28.460
What the bloody hell?

34:28.556 --> 34:29.541
Where is she?

34:29.542 --> 34:32.005
[Vampires groaning]

34:32.005 --> 34:34.579
Davina: Please!
They'll kill him!

34:34.580 --> 34:35.780
Well, he should have
thought about that

34:35.781 --> 34:37.347
before he betrayed our sister.

34:37.348 --> 34:39.848
Rebekah never made it
to her new body, did she,

34:39.849 --> 34:41.449
and seeing as how you
cast the spell

34:41.449 --> 34:42.982
and, well, you're you,

34:42.983 --> 34:45.226
I'd hardly call it
an uncrackable case.

34:45.226 --> 34:47.483
Rebekah's fine, Nik.

34:47.484 --> 34:48.760
It was a prank,

34:49.219 --> 34:51.489
nothing more than anything
you lot have done to me,

34:51.491 --> 34:53.192
but I guess it's different
when it's one of y... aah!

34:53.193 --> 34:57.928
Ooh. Barrier's back up.

34:57.929 --> 35:02.452
Those vampires look
oh so hungry.

35:02.453 --> 35:04.939
I was willing to welcome
you back into my home,

35:04.940 --> 35:09.638
but you had to return to your selfish,
petty, jealousies.

35:09.639 --> 35:11.711
Well, let's see how well
they help you survive

35:11.712 --> 35:13.201
when you're stuck in there!

35:27.624 --> 35:28.758
I would make myself scarce.

35:28.759 --> 35:30.092
Go.

35:30.093 --> 35:32.927
[Vampires clamoring]

35:45.387 --> 35:47.353
I should have known this
whole thing would go to hell

35:47.469 --> 35:49.796
the moment Klaus offered me
those damn moonlight rings.

35:49.797 --> 35:51.797
God. Moonlight ring,
daylight ring.

35:51.798 --> 35:53.532
If I never hear
the word "ring" again,

35:53.533 --> 35:55.618
it would be all too soon.

36:08.281 --> 36:10.300
Maybe just one more.

36:19.596 --> 36:21.364
I had no right

36:21.365 --> 36:23.504
to act the way I did earlier.

36:23.505 --> 36:25.238
You were just being
honest with me,

36:25.239 --> 36:26.339
and that is something
I should have done

36:26.340 --> 36:29.007
with you
from the very beginning.

36:31.378 --> 36:33.983
I love you, Hayley.

36:36.987 --> 36:38.320
No. Let me say this.

36:38.321 --> 36:41.357
I-I know we're only doing this

36:41.358 --> 36:43.356
to fix all the stuff
that we broke

36:43.357 --> 36:45.659
when we sold our souls
for those damn rings,

36:45.660 --> 36:50.367
ok, but I-I loved you
before I knew you,

36:50.368 --> 36:52.003
and every moment
that I spend with you,

36:52.004 --> 36:56.275
every single thing
that I learn about you

36:56.276 --> 37:00.748
just makes me love you
even more.

37:00.749 --> 37:04.283
I promise that we will turn
this around for our pack.

37:04.284 --> 37:05.651
We'll save our friends
from whatever hell

37:05.652 --> 37:07.287
we've dragged them into,

37:07.288 --> 37:09.525
and that is the only thing
that I can ask from you...

Because I have made
a lot of mistakes

37:16.563 --> 37:18.379
in my life, Hayley Marshall,

37:18.380 --> 37:22.455
and forcing you to love me
isn't gonna be one of them...

that you'll marry me.

me to do nothing?

38:07.408 --> 38:09.109
Elijah, right now,
the most important thing

38:09.110 --> 38:13.616
is that you are there,
protecting hope.

38:13.617 --> 38:15.017
So be it.

mean to eavesdrop.

that we lost our freya

that happiness back.

You should have stopped there.
