00:20.606 --> 00:23.443
Best time of the day, laddie.

00:25.194 --> 00:28.281
You miss him, don't you?

00:28.364 --> 00:32.201
-Yeah.
-I can't believe
he's gone myself.

00:32.284 --> 00:36.080
Well, we're gonna have to
face up to it, starting today.

00:37.665 --> 00:39.625
I'm going to
advertise for a replacement.

00:39.709 --> 00:41.919
It's not been that
long since he went.

00:42.003 --> 00:45.089
-It's been long enough.
-You could get in touch
with his daughter again.

00:45.173 --> 00:49.177
-See if she's
heard anything yet.
-No, my mind's made up.

00:49.260 --> 00:52.388
We can't run this place
if we're short-staffed.

00:54.515 --> 00:58.895
-Come on,
let's go back to bed.
-That's it, then?

00:58.978 --> 01:01.105
No more Golly at Glenbogle?

01:01.189 --> 01:05.275
Well,
it was his decision, Lex.
He was the one who left.

01:55.743 --> 01:58.663
Are you sure this
is the right time
to be taking on someone new?

01:58.745 --> 02:00.998
We can't exactly offer
them job security, can we?

02:01.082 --> 02:03.876
We can't afford
to think like that.

02:03.960 --> 02:07.880
If we're gonna have any chance
at all, we need to be
properly staffed.

02:07.964 --> 02:12.343
I'm gonna write out the ad,
but you'll have to
send them a cheque.

02:12.427 --> 02:17.306
Fine. Just put it on
top of my to-do pile.

02:17.390 --> 02:21.436
You've got a to-do pile?
That's very organised.

02:21.519 --> 02:25.189
Don't sound so surprised.
It's why you put me
in charge of accounts.

02:25.273 --> 02:28.609
Mmm. One of my
better decisions, I think.

02:28.693 --> 02:32.905
You know, today might be
a good time to have
a look at the books.

02:37.493 --> 02:38.995
-Morning.
-Morning.

Fresh-baked bread,
Golly's favourite.

02:50.840 --> 02:52.550
Wouldn't eat anything else.

02:52.633 --> 02:56.512
Yep, he thought it was
the best thing
since sliced bread.

02:57.430 --> 02:59.349
Pass me that flour, will you?

03:00.975 --> 03:02.852
Thanks.

03:02.935 --> 03:06.522
The real trick is in the
kneading. You've really gotta
go for it, you know.

03:06.606 --> 03:09.359
Work the dough
through with your hands.

03:09.442 --> 03:10.943
You wanna try?

03:18.743 --> 03:20.953
Don't just tickle it, Duncan.

-Hi. Hello.
-There it is.
Duncan, would you be a dear?

04:00.576 --> 04:04.204
When you've finished with the
stepladder, bring it into
the hall for me, would you?

04:04.288 --> 04:07.709
Aye, right, okay, Molly.

04:07.792 --> 04:11.504
Oh, Irene, I know you don't
like having things sprung on
you at the last minute,

04:11.587 --> 04:13.339
so I thought I'd give
you a bit of warning.

04:13.423 --> 04:16.341
We've got a visitor tomorrow,
an art dealer from Glasgow.

04:16.426 --> 04:17.427
Great.

04:18.386 --> 04:20.512
Right. Fine.

04:20.596 --> 04:23.266
Well, I thought you'd
like to make a nice lunch.

04:23.349 --> 04:25.601
Brilliant idea. Anything else?

04:25.685 --> 04:30.982
No, nothing at all. I'm going
to rearrange the paintings
in the hall, I think.

04:32.567 --> 04:34.777
Want him to see the place
in the best possible light.

04:34.861 --> 04:36.654
Another brilliant idea.

04:38.197 --> 04:41.951
Yes, well, I'll
leave you to your baking.

04:42.035 --> 04:45.496
Um, Duncan, if you
are going to give Irene
a helping hand,

04:45.580 --> 04:47.999
you really ought
to be more careful.

04:52.211 --> 04:54.380
Got it. Thanks, Molly.

05:01.387 --> 05:04.182
I thought she was onto
us there for a moment.

05:19.655 --> 05:21.032
-Problem?
-No, no.

05:21.115 --> 05:23.951
You've obviously got
some sort of system here.

05:25.328 --> 05:27.288
Correct. And?

05:27.372 --> 05:30.166
Nothing, nothing, I've
got every confidence in you.

05:30.249 --> 05:33.002
Glad to hear it. Is that
a copy of the ad you want?

05:33.086 --> 05:35.922
-Yep.
-Fine, just leave it with me.

05:36.005 --> 05:38.383
Okay, have a nice day.

05:38.466 --> 05:40.968
Listen, since I'm here,
I might as well have
a look at the books.

05:41.052 --> 05:45.098
No offence,
Arch, but you wouldn't have
a Scooby what's going on here.

05:45.181 --> 05:50.269
Look, I'll do you a print-out,
a breakdown,
so you know where we stand.

05:50.353 --> 05:52.438
-Great.
-Okay, then.

05:54.482 --> 05:58.277
-I'll leave you to it.
-Yeah, probably the best bet.
It is my job after all.

05:58.361 --> 06:02.949
Now, come on, you have to get
ready for the school party and
I'll, er, crack on here.

06:35.815 --> 06:39.986

are you, Irene?
-Me?

06:40.069 --> 06:44.282
No, no, in fact,
I've got something for you.

might be embarrassed,
just a smidgeon.

searching the woods
is a good idea?

No, I wasn't talking
about that specifically.

-No, I mean, in general.

for example, you and Lex.

you were looking
and then you found each other.

-Duncan, is there
something on your mind?
-No, I mean, no.

15:07.618 --> 15:10.538
Good. Let's just concentrate
on the search then, shall we?

15:10.621 --> 15:12.498
Yes. Sorry.

it's not you that I'm mad at,

telling off, don't say you
were lost, right?

16:20.525 --> 16:25.655
Just say you were
away for a wee explore.
Okay? Come on.

16:25.738 --> 16:28.074

kicked in, then.

16:45.258 --> 16:49.470
I wasn't planning on serving
chicken for lunch actually,
Lexie. I've made soup.

16:49.554 --> 16:52.098
Soup? Oh, that's a great idea.

16:52.181 --> 16:54.225
Well,
you know, I have my moments.

16:54.308 --> 16:58.896
-Here.
Put some in the flask for me.
-Flask? What for?

17:00.732 --> 17:02.817
To keep it warm.

17:04.777 --> 17:07.905
I suppose it's a nice
enough day for a picnic.

17:07.989 --> 17:11.534
-I'm not going on a picnic.
-Then what are you doing?

17:11.617 --> 17:16.079
Oh, ah, well, Archie and
Duncan, you know, they've not
had any lunch today.

17:16.164 --> 17:20.792
So how can you form
an effective search party
on an empty stomach, eh?

17:37.310 --> 17:41.314
Well, you never know
how long they're
gonna be out there for.

17:41.397 --> 17:43.900
Too much information, Lexie.
Really.

17:53.993 --> 17:56.746
-Oh you poor dear,
are you still here?
-Yes.

17:56.828 --> 17:58.873
I'd forgotten all about you.

17:58.956 --> 18:02.210
-Well, you're here now...
-Why don't you run
along and join your class?

18:02.292 --> 18:05.046
My class?
What's that supposed to mean?

18:05.129 --> 18:07.840
Aren't you a teacher
with one of
Archie's school trips?

18:07.924 --> 18:13.221
No, Mrs MacDonald,
my name's Martin Carter.
We spoke on the phone.

18:13.304 --> 18:17.517
Oh, no!
But you're a day early.
I thought we said the 23rd.

18:17.600 --> 18:19.394
We did.

18:19.477 --> 18:23.439
Oh, dear! And here I am
rearranging all the paintings
to try and make

18:23.523 --> 18:24.691
a first good impression.

18:24.774 --> 18:26.651
You must think I'm an
absolute nincompoop.

18:26.734 --> 18:28.403
Not at all, it's just what
I was expecting.

18:28.486 --> 18:32.782
-Thank you.
Ah, Lexie, this is...
-Can't stop. Sorry.

18:32.865 --> 18:36.744
Although it's fair to say,
I was not expecting that.

18:36.828 --> 18:39.664
Right, Mrs MacDonald,
since we both
know the score now,

18:39.747 --> 18:42.417
why don't you show me
what you've got to offer?

18:45.837 --> 18:49.507
Right now, remember,
look after yourself, okay?

18:51.551 --> 18:53.136
Away you go.

19:09.444 --> 19:13.740
I hope they're not all like
this. I can shift most bits of
so-called heritage but...

19:13.823 --> 19:16.617
-That's not for sale anyway.
-I see.

19:16.701 --> 19:19.954
Well, maybe you can show me
the ones that are up for sale.

19:20.038 --> 19:22.248
Might save us
a wee bit of time, eh?

19:22.331 --> 19:25.335
There was one
on the staircase,
might have some potential.

19:25.418 --> 19:27.503
I thought you might
appreciate that one.

19:27.587 --> 19:29.797
That's why I brought it down
from the back landing.

19:29.881 --> 19:33.551
That's not for sale either.
Those paintings
belong to the house.

19:33.634 --> 19:37.638
But you've spent
the morning working out
the best way to display them.

19:37.722 --> 19:41.642
Why do that if not
to ply your wares?

19:41.726 --> 19:45.313
We spoke on the phone
about you selling art to me.

19:45.396 --> 19:48.858
Of course. And here we are.

19:50.360 --> 19:51.861
Ta-da!

19:54.364 --> 19:55.990
All my own work.

20:20.390 --> 20:22.058
Hello!

20:23.476 --> 20:26.229
Can you hear me?

20:26.312 --> 20:31.442
I know that you're out there,
you old numpty.

20:31.526 --> 20:35.947
You can't keep doing this,
living like a hermit,
all on your own.

20:37.365 --> 20:40.493
There's people at
the house that miss you.

20:40.576 --> 20:42.078
Care about you.

20:45.748 --> 20:48.167
Just get yourself home, man.

20:49.919 --> 20:54.549
Just... Get yourself home.

20:54.632 --> 20:58.219
Archie. Archie!
Wait till you hear this.

20:58.302 --> 21:03.850
Wee Stevie, right, he said he
was rescued by the old
man of the woods.

21:03.933 --> 21:06.519
-Really?
-Yeah.

21:06.602 --> 21:10.690
Kids, eh? It's amazing what
they'll come out with just to
get themselves out of trouble.

21:10.773 --> 21:12.984
Oh,
no, I don't think the old man
of the woods is made up.

21:13.067 --> 21:15.653
I think he's about
as real as you and me.

21:30.376 --> 21:33.504
I see you haven't
lost your appetite, then.

21:36.174 --> 21:40.178
-I suppose you're
gonna turn me in?
-What else can I do?

21:40.261 --> 21:43.931
You could let me be.

21:44.015 --> 21:49.354
Though I know that's
more than some folk
round here can manage.

21:49.437 --> 21:53.816
-You're asking a lot of me.
-I said I just wanted
to be left alone, lass.

21:53.900 --> 21:55.693
That's all.

22:15.254 --> 22:17.382
-Been for a spin, have you?
-Yeah.

22:17.465 --> 22:19.884
-Just had to clear my head.
-I saw you.

22:20.885 --> 22:22.929
I know what you were doing.

22:23.012 --> 22:25.223
-Were you spying on me?
-You're in cahoots with Golly.

22:25.306 --> 22:27.141
What?

22:27.225 --> 22:29.310
"Too early to get someone new
in. Why don't you try
his daughter again?"

22:29.394 --> 22:31.646
-Just what do you
think you're playing at?
-I didn't know then.

22:31.729 --> 22:34.107
I just worked out myself
what was going on
about an hour ago.

22:34.190 --> 22:36.943
-That's why I went to see him.
-So, you were planning
on telling me about it?

22:37.026 --> 22:40.780
Yeah. Well, no, not exactly.

22:40.863 --> 22:42.365
Marvellous.

22:42.448 --> 22:45.618
I wanted to give Golly a
chance to come back of
his own accord.

22:45.702 --> 22:47.286
Didn't want someone
bullying him into it.

22:47.370 --> 22:49.205
Is that what you think I am,
a bully?

22:49.288 --> 22:52.500
-Oh, look. Company.
-MOLLY: I'm
dreadfully sorry, Mr Carter.

22:52.583 --> 22:55.211
So am I, Mrs MacDonald. Sorry
I've driven all the way from

22:55.294 --> 22:56.963
Glasgow to look at some
doodlings.

22:57.046 --> 22:58.548
They were really that bad?

22:58.631 --> 23:01.551
Where did you learn about art?
Paint Along With Nancy?

23:01.634 --> 23:05.179
Excuse me. Who are you and
what gives you the right to
speak to my mother like that?

23:05.263 --> 23:08.975
-It's all right, dear.
He's only being honest.
-Martin Carter.

23:09.058 --> 23:11.811
I tried to introduce
myself this morning
but you left in a hurry.

23:11.894 --> 23:14.022
You probably had a stag
to shoot or something.

23:14.105 --> 23:16.441
It's lovely to meet you,
your Lairdship, but I'm away.

23:16.524 --> 23:20.528
You're an art dealer?
So, are you interested
in some of our paintings?

23:20.611 --> 23:23.906
I was.
I came here this morning
with money to spend, but...

23:23.990 --> 23:27.577
-We don't need your money.
-Let's not be too hasty now.

23:27.660 --> 23:31.247
We have got a business to run,
we have to
maximise our strengths.

23:31.330 --> 23:33.750
-Even if it means
dealing with this...
-This what?

23:33.833 --> 23:36.461
Now, let's simmer down,
shall we, boys?

23:36.544 --> 23:41.466
Why don't I take Mr Carter
into the kitchen and
give him a spot of lunch?

23:41.549 --> 23:43.634
Then we can maybe
talk some business.

23:43.718 --> 23:47.305
Lunch, great. Why don't you
sell some of the family
silver while you're at it?

23:53.853 --> 23:56.647
-Crisis over?
-Uh-huh.

23:58.816 --> 24:03.321
In fact, I don't have any more
school parties this afternoon,

24:03.404 --> 24:06.199
which means I've got
some time on my hands.

24:12.830 --> 24:15.166
You must miss
the city living out here, eh?

24:15.249 --> 24:18.127
The bars,
the restaurants, clubs.

24:18.211 --> 24:23.466
Clubs? I can't remember
the last time I went dancing.

24:23.549 --> 24:26.719
-Not counting ceilidh.
-(SCOFFING) Ceilidh!

24:26.803 --> 24:30.139
I'd have had you
down as deep house,
not country house.

24:30.223 --> 24:32.600
Used to be.

24:32.684 --> 24:36.688
Used to go to the Tunnel,
the Sub Club, the Art School.

24:36.771 --> 24:39.232
-I used to go
there every Friday.
-Did you?

24:39.315 --> 24:40.900
Probably there on
the same night.

24:40.983 --> 24:44.529
No. I think I would have
remembered you.

24:45.988 --> 24:48.282
You don't go back to
Glasgow much then, eh?

24:48.366 --> 24:51.619
-That's a pity.
-No, I'm very happy here.

24:51.703 --> 24:54.580
Come on, you don't really
buy into all this, do you?

24:54.664 --> 24:57.375
Tradition, heritage,
it's so phoney.

24:57.458 --> 24:59.293
That's a bit cynical,
isn't it?

24:59.377 --> 25:02.088
Coming from someone
who buys and sells the stuff.

25:02.171 --> 25:05.967
And doing quite well out of
it, judging by the sharp
suit and the flash car.

25:06.050 --> 25:09.929
I bought them with money
I earned from a business
I set up myself.

25:10.013 --> 25:11.931
Didn't get everything
handed to me on a plate

25:12.015 --> 25:14.684
because of
the public school I went to
or who my father was.

25:14.767 --> 25:17.729
It's not like that here.
We all work very hard.

25:17.812 --> 25:21.315
Don't get me wrong, Lexie,
I can see it's all worked
out very nicely for you.

25:21.399 --> 25:24.819
You're obviously
on to a good thing,
you married the laird himself.

25:24.902 --> 25:26.946
I don't like what
you're implying.

25:27.030 --> 25:30.742
I was working at
Glenbogle a long time
before I even met Archie.

25:30.825 --> 25:32.035
No offence.

25:34.412 --> 25:36.039
I suppose if you were only
interested in money,

25:36.122 --> 25:37.623
you wouldn't be wasting your
time here.

25:37.707 --> 25:40.460
I know these big old houses
cost a packet to keep going.

25:41.044 --> 25:43.046
We do okay.

25:43.129 --> 25:47.258
But not okay
enough to let your hubby
show me the door, eh?

25:47.342 --> 25:49.677
Why don't you go
and have a wee look
round the house here?

25:49.761 --> 25:52.263
See if anything
takes your fancy.

25:52.347 --> 25:54.182
Paintings, I mean.

25:54.265 --> 25:57.602
You sure?
The laird didn't seem
too keen on selling.

25:59.729 --> 26:01.731
Just you leave
the laird to me.

26:16.162 --> 26:19.165
Well, hello there, big man.

26:19.248 --> 26:23.294
Hello again.
Don't let me disturb you,
I'm just putting these away.

26:23.378 --> 26:27.715
Mrs MacDonald, I owe you an
apology. I was very short
with you this morning.

26:27.799 --> 26:29.926
There was no need for it.
It was just
a misunderstanding.

26:30.009 --> 26:34.222
But of course. It was foolish
of me to think that these
might be worth something.

26:34.305 --> 26:38.142
I'd sold a few to visitors and
I suppose it gave me
delusions of grandeur.

26:38.226 --> 26:41.062
How much?
What sort of price tag
are we talking about?

26:41.145 --> 26:43.481
I think Â£50 was
my best effort.

26:43.564 --> 26:46.401
50? You were
practically giving them away.

26:46.484 --> 26:49.612
That's the thing about art,
you see, you've got to find
the right market.

26:49.696 --> 26:53.116
I mean,
take this fella for instance.
It's not my cup of tea at all.

26:53.199 --> 26:57.704
Give me a pickled sheep's
carcass any day, but I should
be able to shift him for you.

26:57.787 --> 27:02.667
Lots of ancestry addicts
in the States and
Canada ready to snap him up.

27:02.750 --> 27:07.714
Maybe this trip wasn't
a complete waste
of time after all.

27:07.797 --> 27:11.175
I just don't want to sell
what's left of our heritage
to somebody like that.

27:11.259 --> 27:15.555
Like what? Glaswegian? Working
class? Does that
remind you of anyone?

27:15.638 --> 27:18.891
That's not what I mean and you
know it. The guy's obviously
out to make a killing

27:18.975 --> 27:21.352
and he can smell when
someone's desperate to sell.

27:21.436 --> 27:23.438
Are we desperate, Lex?

27:25.523 --> 27:28.651
Well, let me take a look at
the books, things might not be
as bad as all that.

27:28.735 --> 27:32.238
No. That is my job, you...

27:32.321 --> 27:37.827
Not interrupting anything,
am I? I'm thinking about
making an offer for this.

27:37.910 --> 27:42.040
Oh, well,
any sale would be a wrench.
Especially for Archie.

27:42.123 --> 27:44.208
That's old Cuthbert.
I thought he was in the vault.

27:44.292 --> 27:46.377
Molly's been moving
stuff around all day.

27:46.461 --> 27:49.422
This is interesting as is,
but the kind of folk
that buy this stuff

27:49.505 --> 27:52.091
only care about one thing,
authenticity.

27:52.175 --> 27:54.427
We'll need to find
the documents of provenance.

27:54.510 --> 27:57.138
If I can prove it was painted
on the bonnie, bonnie banks

27:57.221 --> 27:59.599
of some loch or other,
it's gonna up the value.

27:59.682 --> 28:03.603
To the buyer,
the dealer and the vendor.

28:03.686 --> 28:06.272
And what if we want to have it
valued independently?

28:06.356 --> 28:12.862
Darling, weren't you going to
track down that old friend of
ours? Remember?

28:12.945 --> 28:17.700
Fine. But I won't be long
and we'll talk as
soon as I get back.

28:18.242 --> 28:19.494
Fine.

28:28.002 --> 28:29.837
(DUNCAN SINGING)

28:37.679 --> 28:42.767
-You're in a good mood.
-Yeah, I guess I am, really.

28:42.850 --> 28:47.105
-Irene give you a bit of
a treat for lunch, did she?
-Well, you know, um...

28:48.189 --> 28:50.316
Favouritism. Shocking.

28:50.400 --> 28:52.402
So, where we off to, Arch?

28:52.485 --> 28:56.072
We are gonna track down
the wild man of the woods.

28:58.783 --> 29:01.452
Golly,
we're bringing Golly home.

29:06.332 --> 29:09.961
This Grace, she couldn't
own a business or something,
could she?

29:10.044 --> 29:11.713
Somewhere Hector
used to shop, maybe?

29:11.796 --> 29:14.090
No, there was no invoices
for anything.

29:14.173 --> 29:17.552
And these chequebooks
were just tucked away, hidden.

29:17.635 --> 29:20.346
But I need to find out
who she is, because as far
as I can see,

29:20.430 --> 29:23.224
the money is still coming out
of the business account.

29:23.307 --> 29:25.935
That's not going to look
very good to the taxman,
is it?

29:26.019 --> 29:29.647
You think Hector was claiming
his mistress as an expense?

29:29.731 --> 29:32.650
Until I find another
explanation, yeah.

29:32.734 --> 29:34.527
Oh, classy.

29:35.278 --> 29:37.363
Poor Molly.

29:37.447 --> 29:39.032
Mrs MacDonald found
what we're after.

29:39.115 --> 29:40.950
I'm glad to have made
myself useful for once.

29:41.034 --> 29:43.327
Molly, don't talk
about yourself like that.

29:43.411 --> 29:45.621
Come on, we've got
a party to get you to.

29:45.705 --> 29:48.166
Oh, actually, I was thinking
I might stay at home tonight.

29:48.249 --> 29:52.253
Then think again.
It's glad rags time.
Come on, let's go.

29:52.337 --> 29:55.757
Goodbye, Cuthbert.
You're old and unwanted,
but I shall miss you.

29:57.717 --> 29:59.802
Touching stuff, but I hope
you're not gonna pull any

29:59.886 --> 30:01.846
"romantic attachment
to the past" rubbish

30:01.929 --> 30:03.890
to bump the price up.

30:03.973 --> 30:07.393
Well, it's not rubbish,
though, is it? People do get
attached to the past

30:07.477 --> 30:11.481
'cause they think it's
something they can count on,
something that can't change.

30:11.564 --> 30:13.399
But it can.

30:13.483 --> 30:15.818
I'm not with you.

30:15.902 --> 30:19.572
Look,
I need more time to think
before I give anything away.

30:19.655 --> 30:21.491
You'd be selling, not giving.

30:21.574 --> 30:24.577
I'm not gonna be rushed
into making a decision now.

30:24.660 --> 30:28.122
Okay. It so happens I'm
around for one more day.

30:28.206 --> 30:31.793
I'll come back tomorrow and
you can decide if you're ready
to take my money.

30:34.712 --> 30:36.464
You're so kind, Irene.

30:36.547 --> 30:39.509
I just think you deserve to go
out and have a good time,
that's all.

30:39.592 --> 30:43.596
All those bright young things.
I'm not sure about this.

30:43.680 --> 30:47.016
I've already been made to feel
quite foolish
enough by Mr Carter.

30:47.100 --> 30:48.768
-Oh, but...
-I'm serious.

30:48.851 --> 30:51.854
It was my dream to see my
paintings in an exhibition,

30:51.938 --> 30:54.649
not to make an exhibition
of myself.

30:54.732 --> 30:57.985
At least when Hector was alive
there was someone else
to provide the floorshow.

30:58.069 --> 30:59.737
Forget about Hector.

31:02.824 --> 31:07.203
Look, what I mean is,
you've got so much to
offer in your own right.

31:07.286 --> 31:11.040
Okay, so you might feel
a bit out of place at this do,

31:11.124 --> 31:13.376
but we can soon
put that right.

31:15.753 --> 31:18.381
What's he playing at?
Honestly.

31:18.464 --> 31:20.842
-Search me.
-A man of his age.

31:20.925 --> 31:25.179
I wish he'd make his mind up.
I'm quitting Glenbogle,
I'm not quitting Glenbogle.

31:25.263 --> 31:28.099
I mean,
what's it gonna be, Golly?

31:28.182 --> 31:30.977
I should have known he'd
never leave this place.

31:31.060 --> 31:34.564
This is it, this is
where she left the hamper.

31:34.647 --> 31:37.191
If we're gonna find him,
this is a good place to start.

31:37.275 --> 31:42.655
Aye, if, if. We will
find him, no matter what.

31:43.531 --> 31:45.283
We're gonna find him.

31:50.830 --> 31:54.792
-Can you smell anything?
-Mmm, aye, it's grass.

31:56.544 --> 31:58.713
Do you think he took the food?

31:58.796 --> 32:00.590
It's hard to say, Duncan.

32:00.673 --> 32:02.425
It could have been any one
of the people who live wild
on the estate.

32:02.508 --> 32:04.177
You mean there's more?

32:04.260 --> 32:07.388
Nobody ever tells me anything.

32:07.472 --> 32:10.600
-I'm not sure about this.
-Well, I am.

32:10.683 --> 32:16.731
You shall go to the ball,
Cinderella, and you shall
knock 'em dead, okay? Good.

32:16.814 --> 32:22.987
-You're at this very
hip and trendy soiree.
-Hip, trendy, cool, gotcha.

32:23.696 --> 32:25.031
Good.

32:26.157 --> 32:28.659
A gentleman approaches you.

32:29.660 --> 32:33.915
-Good evening.
-How do you do?

32:33.998 --> 32:37.418
I was just wondering,
could I get you a drink?

32:37.502 --> 32:41.798
That's very kind.
How about a dry sherry?

32:43.424 --> 32:44.967
Molly.

32:45.051 --> 32:48.221
"How do you do?" was bad
enough, but dry sherry?

32:48.304 --> 32:52.600
Come on, you can do better
than that. Just loosen up a
little, be yourself.

32:52.684 --> 32:54.686
What should I have asked for?

32:54.769 --> 32:57.522
Well, I think there are
two ways to go on this.

32:57.605 --> 33:02.235
The sophisticated classics,
like a Cosmopolitan
or a Manhattan.

33:02.318 --> 33:06.823
-And the other way?
-Something a bit more daring.

33:10.660 --> 33:12.286
Tequila.

33:23.089 --> 33:26.592
Okay, Grace, I know
you're in here somewhere.

33:33.349 --> 33:35.685
We're wasting our time,
he could be anywhere.

33:37.645 --> 33:39.313
So are we just gonna
head home, then?

33:39.397 --> 33:42.859
No, no, no, no, we're gonna
find the old...

33:42.942 --> 33:47.238
Look, you know when he takes
us stalking, what is it that
he always says?

33:47.321 --> 33:50.575
Whisky and
shotguns do not mix.

33:50.658 --> 33:55.121
Yeah, yeah, but I was thinking
more the one about how
the land is a book

33:55.204 --> 33:58.499
-and you've gotta
learn how to read it.
-Yeah, yeah.

33:58.583 --> 34:00.418
That was one of his
favourites actually.

34:00.501 --> 34:03.463
And that is what
we're gonna have to do.

34:03.546 --> 34:07.633
Look for the slightest clue,
something that's
not quite right.

34:07.717 --> 34:12.597
A broken twig, a thread
of cotton on a branch.

34:12.679 --> 34:17.060
The sort of thing that only
somebody really in tune with
nature would notice.

34:25.400 --> 34:28.237
Oh, I've been into
art for years, yeah.

34:28.321 --> 34:32.033
-Modern stuff mainly.
-I've been a fan
since Warhol actually.

34:32.116 --> 34:33.993
Oh, he was the man.

34:34.077 --> 34:38.081
Although, one could say
his greatest work of art
was his own persona.

34:41.876 --> 34:45.672
-What?
Have I gone all square again?
-No, no, that was really cool.

34:45.755 --> 34:50.009
-I just wasn't ready for it.
-So I really am
kicking donkey.

34:52.637 --> 34:55.264
-You go, girl.
-Go where?

34:55.348 --> 34:57.058
Anywhere you want, Molly.

35:03.481 --> 35:06.109
(BOTH GRIMACING)

35:06.192 --> 35:08.945
Perhaps I shouldn't go alone.

35:10.113 --> 35:11.906
What about another?

35:13.324 --> 35:15.910
So do you think he'll
be pleased to see us?

35:15.993 --> 35:19.706
I don't think he'll be rolling
out the red carpet, no.

35:19.789 --> 35:22.917
Well, maybe we should
just leave him alone.

35:23.001 --> 35:25.336
No, no way.

35:25.420 --> 35:29.716
-We're not going anywhere
without talking to him.
-Having a row, you mean?

35:29.799 --> 35:34.470
Well, whatever it takes
to make him see sense.

35:34.554 --> 35:38.432
Well,
that usually adds up to a row
between you two these days.

35:38.516 --> 35:42.228
No offence, Arch, but it
wouldn't exactly be the
first barney you and

35:42.311 --> 35:43.645
Golly have had, would it?

35:43.730 --> 35:45.565
You'll be there to
keep the peace, won't you?

35:45.647 --> 35:49.068
Ah, well, you see, that's
just it. I'm not exactly

35:49.152 --> 35:50.902
Golly's favourite person
at the moment.

35:50.987 --> 35:53.614
I mean, I don't know
what he's gonna
say when he sees me.

35:53.698 --> 35:56.158
Well, we're about to find out.
Come on.

36:15.094 --> 36:17.597
Maybe we should
just wait here.

36:17.680 --> 36:20.850
GOLLY: You've come this far,
you might as well come in.

36:33.571 --> 36:36.282
-Right, ready to circulate?
-No.

36:36.366 --> 36:40.745
Good, that's the spirit.
Come on, let's see if we
can spot a friendly face.

37:10.316 --> 37:12.360
It's nice here, Golly.

37:15.321 --> 37:20.076
Hasn't he made
a nice wee house
for himself, Archie?

37:20.159 --> 37:24.205
Oh,
yeah, I'm sure Country Life
will be along any minute.

37:24.288 --> 37:27.041
Caves are the new
cottages or something.

37:34.924 --> 37:39.595
I'm sorry, I didn't come here
to make fun of you.
I came to bring you home.

37:45.476 --> 37:47.645
It's so good to be here,
seeing work like this.

37:47.729 --> 37:51.482
I've spent the last eight
hours surrounded by stuffed
animals and dead ancestors.

37:51.566 --> 37:55.820
Yes, I imagine anyone might
find that kind of
atmosphere oppressive.

37:55.903 --> 38:00.408
But since your
tastes run to the modern,
what do you think of this?

38:01.993 --> 38:04.328
I like it, I have to say.

38:04.412 --> 38:07.498
It has a still quality
to it, a coldness almost.

38:07.582 --> 38:09.667
-Reminds me of early Hockney.
-Really?

38:09.751 --> 38:12.795
I remember him saying to me,
at a do not unlike this one,

38:12.879 --> 38:16.841
that it saddened him
that people never found
the warmth in his work.

38:16.924 --> 38:20.595
You went to a party
with David Hockney?

38:20.678 --> 38:24.098
Well, I actually went with
David Bailey but he just
happened to be there.

38:24.182 --> 38:28.186
I think the party was given by
Mick Jagger and
Marianne Faithful.

38:28.269 --> 38:32.273
-Could I get you
a glass of champagne?
-Why not?

38:36.903 --> 38:39.072
-We're going.
-What?

38:39.155 --> 38:42.116
First rule of cool, Molly.
Always leave
them wanting more.

38:43.368 --> 38:47.330
It is Irene, isn't it?
I thought so.

38:47.413 --> 38:50.833
Camilla Doyle,
I designed the menus
for the hotel in Edinburgh.

38:50.917 --> 38:52.752
Oh, yes, of course.
I remember you.

38:52.835 --> 38:54.962
I'm ashamed to say
I haven't had
time to pop in yet.

38:55.046 --> 38:58.091
I've been working in London.
So, how's it all going?

38:58.174 --> 39:01.260
-Oh, great,
you know, busy, busy, busy.
-Fab. And how's...

39:01.344 --> 39:04.180
Look,
I'd love to stay and chat,
but you know how it is. Bye.

39:10.687 --> 39:14.691
I'd like to see
either of you two
make it on your own out here.

39:15.983 --> 39:18.152
I admit it, I'm impressed.

39:18.236 --> 39:20.363
You've been living off the
land, fishing in the loch.

39:20.446 --> 39:23.491
It's all real
back-to-nature stuff.

39:23.574 --> 39:25.910
I thought you
weren't here to make fun.

39:25.993 --> 39:28.830
I'm not. I'm trying
to make you see sense.

39:28.913 --> 39:31.374
No, you mean see
things the way you do.
It's different.

39:31.457 --> 39:34.961
If you're not happy with your
work at the Wildlife Centre,
then we can talk about it.

39:35.044 --> 39:36.754
Wildlife Centre.

39:36.838 --> 39:38.798
Well, we can't all
live in the Stone Age.

39:38.881 --> 39:40.633
It may come as a shock and
surprise to you, Archie,

39:40.717 --> 39:43.052
but I've nothing against
moving with the times.

39:43.136 --> 39:46.556
And everything I'm doing
is to secure
a future for Glenbogle.

39:46.639 --> 39:48.891
As long as you
don't forget the past.

39:48.975 --> 39:52.311
If Glenbogle is worth
anything, it's because of
what the past made it.

39:52.395 --> 39:55.231
It's what made
it the place it is
and us the people that we are.

39:55.314 --> 39:59.902
That's one of the reasons I
want you to come home. You've
lived here all your life.

39:59.986 --> 40:01.487
Thought I'd never leave.

40:01.571 --> 40:04.782
-And you don't have to.
-Time to move on, Archie.

40:04.866 --> 40:06.200
Why?

40:07.452 --> 40:09.537
I don't understand.

40:09.620 --> 40:13.291
Because I don't want to
end up a blind old man
getting in everyone's way.

40:18.629 --> 40:21.883
We can work something out.

40:21.966 --> 40:25.678
Even in this light
I know a look of
pity when I see one.

40:43.279 --> 40:46.616
Oh, Lexie, dear,
are you still doing this?

40:48.117 --> 40:52.038
No. No, I'm finished in here.

40:52.121 --> 40:55.500
Molly,
I need to ask you a question.

40:56.459 --> 40:58.795
Could...

40:58.878 --> 41:01.714
I don't want to
upset you, but...

41:01.798 --> 41:05.176
There's nowhere
else Archie's dad
might have kept...

41:05.259 --> 41:09.180
You know, sensitive stuff?

41:09.263 --> 41:13.601
Well,
the only place I can think of
is Hector's private safe.

41:14.644 --> 41:16.020
Hector's what?

41:18.189 --> 41:21.859
-Molly,
do you know the combination?
-Not a clue.

41:21.943 --> 41:23.403
Right, Molly, think.

41:23.486 --> 41:27.865
Anniversaries,
the boys' birthdays, anything?

41:27.949 --> 41:33.287
-Try 11, 05, 36.
-What's that?

41:33.371 --> 41:36.249
The day that Hector
caught his first
trout in the loch.

41:47.260 --> 41:51.681
We can look into this. I'm
sure medical science has moved
on since your father's day.

41:51.764 --> 41:53.224
Doctors.

41:55.143 --> 41:58.980
You mean you haven't
even had your eyes tested?

41:59.063 --> 42:02.900
We wanna help.
We are your friends.

42:02.984 --> 42:04.736
Is that a fact?

42:04.819 --> 42:08.406
Well, you both had a funny way
of showing it lately.

42:08.489 --> 42:10.700
I've had enough of this.

42:16.080 --> 42:17.582
Look, Golly...

42:17.665 --> 42:19.709
(DUNCAN SHOUTING)

42:24.255 --> 42:26.674
-What is this?
-Oh, nothing.

42:30.011 --> 42:34.223
-But you came to help me.
-I only came because this
place is full of pot holes

42:34.307 --> 42:37.018
and I didn't want you breaking
your leg out here in
the middle of nowhere.

42:37.101 --> 42:40.104
A likely story, Golly.
Why don't you
just admit that...

42:47.695 --> 42:51.157
-These look like...
-Love letters. Ooh.

42:52.325 --> 42:53.826
They are.

42:55.787 --> 42:58.373
They're from me.

42:58.456 --> 43:02.919
Oh, I had no idea
Hector kept them
all these years.

43:03.002 --> 43:05.963
Well, all that's left is this,
but, erm, well, you don't

43:06.047 --> 43:08.091
really need to read that,
Molly.

43:08.174 --> 43:12.470
Why ever not? Grace,
I know all about Grace.
Hector told me everything.

43:16.140 --> 43:18.017
Oh, my God.

43:19.727 --> 43:22.897
Don't try and
stand on it, Archie,
it might be broken.

43:22.980 --> 43:25.274
No,
I think it's just a sprain.

43:27.068 --> 43:30.196
-The arm's worse.
-Will I get an ambulance?

43:30.279 --> 43:33.700
No, it'll take them
hours to get here.
He's getting cold.

43:33.783 --> 43:36.077
We'll both have to
move him ourselves.

43:36.160 --> 43:38.871
-Are you up for it, Duncan?
-Aye.

43:38.955 --> 43:40.873
Good man. Archie!

43:40.957 --> 43:44.961
You just stay where you are
and we'll get you out
of there in no time.

43:45.044 --> 43:48.673
Stay where I am?
Okay, if you insist.

43:50.466 --> 43:52.176
I'll only be a minute.

43:56.723 --> 44:01.019
I mean it. I appreciate your
help, I really do, but I think
this is a one woman job now.

44:01.102 --> 44:03.855
-Are you sure?
-Positive.

44:03.938 --> 44:07.525
Now that we've solved that
Grace mystery, I can get on
and do this tax return.

44:07.608 --> 44:09.652
I might even get it
finished by breakfast.

44:09.736 --> 44:13.031
-Now go.
-Good luck, Lex.

44:13.114 --> 44:14.907
Thanks, Irene.

44:17.702 --> 44:19.037
Okay.

44:23.624 --> 44:25.084
Okay, Duncan.

44:27.754 --> 44:30.631
-Right,
let's have a look at you.
-Aah!

44:30.715 --> 44:32.925
I'm sorry, son, sorry, sorry.

44:34.302 --> 44:36.262
Duncan can't lift both of us.

44:36.346 --> 44:39.515
Even if he could,
the rope wouldn't take it.

44:39.599 --> 44:41.976
What about some
sort of harness?

44:42.060 --> 44:44.479
We could, but that
arm's still a problem.

44:45.938 --> 44:48.399
-Right.
-Golly, no.

44:48.483 --> 44:51.611
It's all right, Duncan,
I know what I'm doing.

44:51.694 --> 44:54.822
You trust me,
don't you, Archie?

44:54.906 --> 44:56.157
Yeah.

44:56.240 --> 44:58.409
Good man. Okay.

45:22.517 --> 45:25.895
Okay,
boys, come home to us now.

45:27.230 --> 45:29.148
You've had your fun.

45:34.404 --> 45:38.199
Okay, son, now this is gonna
hurt but once you get
your shoulder back in,

45:38.282 --> 45:40.284
we'll get you
out of here, okay?

45:40.368 --> 45:41.994
Right, after three.

45:42.078 --> 45:46.290
One, two, three.

45:46.374 --> 45:47.917
(SCREAMING)

45:53.172 --> 45:55.675
Sorry. Bit squeamish.

45:57.051 --> 45:58.344
Sorry.

46:01.848 --> 46:03.683
Okay.

46:15.403 --> 46:18.489
Archie? What happened?

46:18.573 --> 46:21.826
It's okay, it's just a sprain.
I'll be fine.
Golly, I can manage.

46:21.909 --> 46:24.871
The last time you hurt
yourself out on the estate,
I carried you in.

46:24.954 --> 46:27.123
Seven, I think you were.

46:31.336 --> 46:32.628
What is it?

46:32.712 --> 46:35.882
I never thought I'd
set foot in here again.

46:36.549 --> 46:38.176
Come on.

46:39.260 --> 46:41.763
Thank you.

46:41.846 --> 46:44.223
Thanks for bringing
him home to me, Golly.

46:44.307 --> 46:48.644
Well,
I couldn't have managed it
without Duncan's help.

46:48.728 --> 46:52.357
-He's a great
asset to you, Archie.
-I know he is.

46:52.440 --> 46:56.235
It's good to know
that the place'll be
in safe hands once I'm away.

46:56.319 --> 46:59.364
You're not going anywhere.
Except to an eye specialist.

46:59.447 --> 47:02.116
Yeah,
with any luck all you'll need
is a zap with a laser.

47:02.200 --> 47:05.119
-Just wait a wee minute here.
-What for?

47:05.203 --> 47:09.582
You have the treatment and
then you let our old
pal Grace pick up the tab.

47:10.500 --> 47:11.668
Grace?

47:11.751 --> 47:17.215
Glenbogle Residents and
Artisans Care Expenses.

47:17.298 --> 47:20.927
LEXIE: Hector set up
an account years ago
and put money into it.

47:21.010 --> 47:23.638
You know, even though
the estate was struggling.

47:23.721 --> 47:26.808
And I'm sure he wouldn't mind
if Golly was a beneficiary.

47:26.891 --> 47:29.769
-ARCHIE: I think
he'd be delighted.
-Ach, I don't know.

47:29.852 --> 47:32.021
LEXIE: Look,
the money is there for you.

47:32.105 --> 47:36.150
It's like a charitable trust
so nobody else can touch it.

47:36.234 --> 47:39.070
The taxman can
take every penny
we've got, but not this.

47:39.153 --> 47:41.406
I don't want your charity,
lassie.

47:41.489 --> 47:44.867
For goodness sake, Golly,
you've spent your entire life
taking care of Glenbogle

47:44.951 --> 47:48.287
and everybody in it,
it's about time we
did something for you.

47:48.371 --> 47:50.456
-So that's it then, is it?
-Yeah.

47:50.540 --> 47:53.292
-You're gonna look after me?
-Yes.

47:55.169 --> 47:56.337
Good.

48:01.551 --> 48:05.096
-Welcome home, Golly.
-Welcome home.

48:05.179 --> 48:07.473
-Welcome home, Golly.
-Welcome home.

48:10.143 --> 48:13.021
-You all right?
-Me? Brilliant.

48:14.188 --> 48:15.690
It's just, well...

48:17.817 --> 48:20.987
It feels strange?

48:21.070 --> 48:24.115
Being with me now
that Golly's back.

48:24.699 --> 48:26.325
Yeah.

48:26.409 --> 48:28.369
Look, if you want to go
back to your own room...

48:28.453 --> 48:31.706
Oh, no, no, this is where
I want to be. Definitely.

48:34.959 --> 48:37.628
-Golly will be okay.
-I know.

49:20.296 --> 49:24.050
-You're not selling?
-Sorry, change of heart.

49:24.133 --> 49:26.052
We decided the old guy had
been here for so long,

49:26.135 --> 49:28.137
it wouldn't be fair
to send him packing.

49:28.221 --> 49:32.016
I know you don't put much
value on history and tradition
Mr Carter, but we do.

49:32.100 --> 49:34.519
I can understand
why you feel that way.

49:34.602 --> 49:36.229
-You can?
-Aye.

49:36.312 --> 49:39.691
Without all that stuff,
there's very little
point to you, is there?

49:39.774 --> 49:42.151
Anyway, I'm
thinking of getting out of
the heritage business,

49:42.235 --> 49:44.987
see if I can't make a splash
with something
a wee bit more modern.

49:45.071 --> 49:46.781
Is your mother about?

49:48.658 --> 49:50.493
Talking to you last
night got me thinking.

49:50.576 --> 49:54.914
Blake,
Yoko Ono, your pal Hockney,
it's the stuff I love.

49:54.997 --> 49:57.792
So I've decided
I'm gonna put on
a '60s exhibition.

49:57.875 --> 50:00.378
Gonna call it
"Defining the divine decade".

50:00.461 --> 50:02.088
And you want me to come along?

50:02.171 --> 50:04.882
Aye,
I thought you might even say
a few words since you've like,

50:04.966 --> 50:07.260
been there,
done that, got the T-shirt.

50:07.343 --> 50:09.137
I never wore T-shirts,
Mr Carter.

50:09.220 --> 50:12.765
In fact, there were
quite a few parties
where one wore nothing at all.

50:13.808 --> 50:15.601
I should be delighted to come.

50:15.685 --> 50:17.812
And you think you're
gonna be able to get
your hands on work like that?

50:17.895 --> 50:20.982
-Surely it's all in
private collections.
-It's not gonna be a sale.

50:21.065 --> 50:22.859
Collectors are
quite good about
loaning out their work

50:22.942 --> 50:26.154
if they know you're not
out to make a fast buck.

50:26.237 --> 50:29.949
And you'll cover her
expenses, naturally.

50:30.033 --> 50:33.786
-And a few quid
for her trouble.
-I think we can manage that.

50:33.870 --> 50:37.331
In fact, Mrs MacDonald, I
might be able to throw more
than a few quid your way.

50:37.415 --> 50:40.710
I'm particularly interested in
any paintings you might have
done back in the '60s.

50:40.793 --> 50:45.089
You, too? That
smartly dressed young man
that I met last night

50:45.173 --> 50:48.259
called this morning and
asked the very same thing.

50:48.343 --> 50:53.222
Why don't I show you some of
my early work and then
the bidding war can begin?

50:56.184 --> 50:58.895
Molly gets her cash,
Carter gets the paintings

50:58.978 --> 51:01.314
and we get to keep Cuthbert,
so everybody's happy.

51:01.397 --> 51:03.107
Not everyone actually.

51:03.191 --> 51:05.943
I've always
hated that painting,
used to give me nightmares.

51:06.027 --> 51:09.822
Gives me the creeps
just thinking about it.

51:09.906 --> 51:12.200
-What's so funny?
-Nothing.

51:12.283 --> 51:13.451
What?
