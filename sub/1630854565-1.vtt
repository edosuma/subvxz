WEBVTT

02:49.859 --> 02:51.550
Okay, so Steve?

02:51.550 --> 02:54.381
He's the one that she's
secretly in love with, right?

02:54.381 --> 02:57.246
Uh-uh, Steve's her fiance,
the big Wall Street tycoon.

02:57.246 --> 03:00.594
Hm, the one that wants to
put Christmas out of business.

03:00.594 --> 03:02.699
Exactly. I hate him.

03:04.253 --> 03:06.807
And the other one is Aaron?

03:06.807 --> 03:09.223
Andy, so he's
a super sweet guy

03:09.223 --> 03:10.811
who works at the ski lodge.

03:10.811 --> 03:12.778
The one where Beth's car got
snowed in for the holidays.

03:12.778 --> 03:14.194
They met in the cutest way.

03:15.367 --> 03:16.886
Hold on a second, I'm working.

03:19.475 --> 03:21.718
How is it? It's
wonderful, right?

03:21.718 --> 03:24.204
It's good. Not great.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.206
Really? I think it's so good.

03:29.070 --> 03:31.107
Are you writing your
review column already?

03:31.107 --> 03:33.351
No, taking a few notes.

03:33.351 --> 03:35.180
I'll write the full
article tonight.

03:36.285 --> 03:38.079
I'll give them an okay review,

03:38.079 --> 03:40.392
and then, when I
come back in a month,

03:40.392 --> 03:41.911
they'll gimme a better dinner.

03:45.363 --> 03:47.468
Well, how do you write
your relationship column?

03:47.468 --> 03:49.850
Don't you, don't you
take notes or something?

03:49.850 --> 03:53.612
No, I just feel
inspired and I write.

03:54.579 --> 03:58.410
Hm. Oh, okay, so Aaron.

03:58.410 --> 04:01.793
- Hm, Andy.
- Andy.

04:01.793 --> 04:05.141
Andy is stuck at the ski
lodge, no, no, no, no.

04:05.141 --> 04:09.214
He is working at the ski
lodge and Beth is stuck there.

04:09.214 --> 04:12.631
Meanwhile, her jerk of a
boyfriend is working in Europe.

04:12.631 --> 04:15.082
Uh-uh, he's in Hawaii.

04:15.082 --> 04:16.497
Right.

04:16.497 --> 04:18.119
- So then the two of them.
- Aaron and Beth?

04:18.119 --> 04:20.605
Andy and Beth, they get
stuck in a car together.

04:22.089 --> 04:24.954
- Okay.
- Okay, what?

04:24.954 --> 04:27.577
- Okay, what happens next?
- I don't know.

04:27.577 --> 04:29.407
I paused the movie so I
could come have dinner

04:29.407 --> 04:32.168
with my best friend,
Kathy Kutlenios,

04:32.168 --> 04:34.619
the world's most
important food critic.

04:34.619 --> 04:35.999
- Hardly.
- You will be

04:35.999 --> 04:38.001
when you get that job
writing for "The Times."

04:38.001 --> 04:40.728
- If.
- Of course you'll get it.

04:40.728 --> 04:43.283
You know more about food
than anyone I've ever met.

04:46.389 --> 04:48.978
You do know how this story
ends for Aaron and Beth, right?

04:48.978 --> 04:51.532
Yes. Probably.

04:52.533 --> 04:53.638
Don't ruin it for me.

04:54.949 --> 04:57.918
Danielle, you are
such a talented writer.

04:57.918 --> 04:59.195
I mean, I understand
that you're writing

04:59.195 --> 05:00.783
the relationship column
for the magazine,

05:00.783 --> 05:05.028
but you could be writing these
holiday movies that you love.

05:05.028 --> 05:06.547
Why aren't you?

05:06.547 --> 05:07.962
I will answer that
when you tell me

05:07.962 --> 05:09.723
why you are writing about food,

05:09.723 --> 05:11.172
when you could be cooking it.

05:12.346 --> 05:14.037
Kathy, you could be
the most talented chef

05:14.037 --> 05:16.039
in all of New York City.

05:18.697 --> 05:21.113
- Saved by the bell.
- I'll be in the bathroom.

05:24.565 --> 05:26.912
- Hello?
- Kathy.

05:26.912 --> 05:28.431
Hey, Mom.

05:28.431 --> 05:31.503
You don't have to sound
so thrilled to hear from me.

05:31.503 --> 05:32.504
I'm thrilled to hear from you.

05:32.504 --> 05:34.713
I'm just not thrilled to hear

05:34.713 --> 05:36.922
about what you're gonna ask me.

05:36.922 --> 05:38.683
And what
am I going to ask you?

05:38.683 --> 05:40.650
Come to Holly for Christmas.

05:40.650 --> 05:43.412
Your father and
I miss you so much.

05:43.412 --> 05:45.310
I miss you guys too.

05:45.310 --> 05:48.209
I just don't miss
that little town.

05:48.209 --> 05:51.212
Holly is the quaintest
little town in all of Michigan.

05:51.212 --> 05:53.870
Hm, that's one
way to describe it.

05:53.870 --> 05:56.563
- Kathy, dear.
- Yes, Mom.

05:58.219 --> 06:00.049
Just say you're
going to come home.

06:03.259 --> 06:05.710
I've already bought
the plane tickets.

06:05.710 --> 06:08.195
Your father will be so happy.

06:08.195 --> 06:10.231
We're planning the
biggest Christmas dinner

06:10.231 --> 06:12.199
this quaint little
town has ever seen.

06:13.442 --> 06:14.270
I'm excited.

Is there something funny
about breaking the law, ma'am?

07:45.395 --> 07:47.190
No, no, no, no.

07:47.190 --> 07:48.985
I wasn't trying to make
anything seem funny.

07:48.985 --> 07:50.884
That's enough, ma'am.

07:50.884 --> 07:52.920
Step out of the vehicle, ma'am.

07:52.920 --> 07:54.163
Are you serious?

07:55.371 --> 07:58.478
Yes, ma'am, just step
out of the vehicle.

08:01.032 --> 08:01.860
Okay.

08:03.552 --> 08:05.105
I'm sorry, ma'am,

08:05.105 --> 08:06.934
I'm, I'm just kidding with you.

08:06.934 --> 08:08.488
I know I need to
stop doing this,

08:08.488 --> 08:12.008
but sometimes I
can't help myself.

08:12.008 --> 08:15.356
Well, talk about
breaking the law.

08:15.356 --> 08:19.637
Impersonating an overly
serious officer? I know.

08:19.637 --> 08:21.155
You know, I might have
to get the phone number

08:21.155 --> 08:22.640
for your chief of police.

08:22.640 --> 08:26.022
Well, I'm not so sure it
would do you any good though.

08:26.022 --> 08:28.438
He's got a bigger sense
of humor than I do.

08:29.992 --> 08:34.824
Well, in that case,
Officer Williams?

08:34.824 --> 08:35.722
Call me Matthew.

08:36.792 --> 08:38.069
Officer Matthew?

08:38.069 --> 08:39.484
Just Matthew.

08:39.484 --> 08:40.692
I'm Kathy, by the way.

08:41.762 --> 08:43.695
Well, I wish we had met

08:43.695 --> 08:45.663
under less reckless
conditions, Kathy.

08:47.043 --> 08:49.701
Reckless? How
fast was I going?

08:50.840 --> 08:53.394
51 in a 25.

08:54.844 --> 08:57.226
Well, that doesn't seem
exceptionally reckless.

08:57.226 --> 08:59.435
Oh, that's reckless.

08:59.435 --> 09:01.264
It's a rental car.

09:01.264 --> 09:04.164
Well, last time I checked
reckless was reckless,

09:04.164 --> 09:06.028
whether you owned
the vehicle or not.

09:07.477 --> 09:11.240
Well, maybe, if you check
your instruments again,

09:11.240 --> 09:13.967
you might see, I was
only going 35 in a 25.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.901
Or if you look really
close, you might see,

09:16.901 --> 09:20.007
I was only going 25 in a 25.

09:20.007 --> 09:21.975
Huh, human error.

09:23.493 --> 09:24.943
That's an interesting thought.

09:24.943 --> 09:26.600
Well, it doesn't
have to be human error.

09:26.600 --> 09:30.639
It could be the blossoming
of early Christmas spirit.

09:30.639 --> 09:34.401
Sort of like a, like
a secret Santa gift,

09:34.401 --> 09:37.231
except from an officer
instead of a coworker.

09:37.231 --> 09:38.957
Yeah, something like that.

09:41.788 --> 09:44.342
I'm gonna need your license
and registration, ma'am.

09:57.666 --> 09:58.943
- It's Kathy.
- Kathy!

10:00.185 --> 10:03.879
Oh, baby girl, you
look so beautiful.

10:03.879 --> 10:05.743
It's so good to see you.

10:05.743 --> 10:07.020
Nice to see you, too.

10:07.020 --> 10:08.055
Kath, it's so nice
to see you, sweetie.

10:08.055 --> 10:09.919
How've you been?
- I'm good.

10:09.919 --> 10:11.024
How was the trip?

10:14.199 --> 10:15.511
Lovely.

10:15.511 --> 10:17.513
Oh, what went wrong?

10:17.513 --> 10:20.274
This town, which
loves me so much,

10:20.274 --> 10:24.140
gifted me with a reckless
driving ticket for Christmas.

10:24.140 --> 10:26.280
That's not the town's fault.

10:26.280 --> 10:27.765
I know it's my fault, Dad,

10:27.765 --> 10:29.525
but that doesn't
make it any better.

10:29.525 --> 10:32.079
What were you two studying
so intently when I came in?

10:32.079 --> 10:34.357
Your father and I
are finalizing plans

10:34.357 --> 10:36.256
for the annual Christmas dinner.

10:36.256 --> 10:38.879
This is gonna be the most
amazing one we've ever had.

10:38.879 --> 10:41.641
We have a very
special guest coming this year.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.712
You got Santa.

10:43.712 --> 10:44.954
How did you pull that off?

10:44.954 --> 10:46.438
I heard he was booked
through the 25th.

10:46.438 --> 10:48.337
Ha, ha.

10:48.337 --> 10:50.719
I'm not gonna let
your big city humbug

10:50.719 --> 10:52.928
infect my Christmas cheer.

10:52.928 --> 10:54.412
You know, I've
never understood

10:54.412 --> 10:56.621
why you can't enjoy
the season, Kath.

10:58.140 --> 11:00.625
Christmas has
never been a really big thing

11:00.625 --> 11:03.490
for our family since we moved.

11:03.490 --> 11:05.216
Moved you here?

11:05.216 --> 11:08.495
Well, that's because we
never really appreciated

11:08.495 --> 11:11.222
the magic of Christmas
until we moved here.

11:11.222 --> 11:14.018
And you two got a good
case of Christmas cheer

11:14.018 --> 11:16.745
when you moved us from DC to
this little slice of Americana,

11:16.745 --> 11:18.954
also known as Holly, Michigan.

11:18.954 --> 11:21.473
But all I got was a new school

11:21.473 --> 11:23.993
for senior year and no friends.

11:23.993 --> 11:26.099
It's the gift that
keeps on giving.

11:27.341 --> 11:29.619
You know, if you could
let it into your heart,

11:29.619 --> 11:32.726
you might find you could love
this town as much as we do.

11:33.762 --> 11:34.901
Yeah, you might like it here

11:34.901 --> 11:37.455
and do the job
you're meant to do.

11:37.455 --> 11:39.733
You two have got
to let that one go.

11:39.733 --> 11:43.012
My life and my career
are in New York.

11:43.012 --> 11:45.670
But you're not
doing what you love.

11:45.670 --> 11:48.777
Life is so much better
when you do what you love

11:48.777 --> 11:51.089
instead of a job where
you just go to work.

11:51.089 --> 11:53.126
And you know that from
personal experience,

11:53.126 --> 11:55.473
don't you, former
Congressman Kutlenios?

11:57.406 --> 11:59.442
Look, I'm not a chef.

11:59.442 --> 12:01.306
I'm a food critic.

12:01.306 --> 12:03.412
You're right,
you're not a chef.

12:03.412 --> 12:07.105
You're more like a
genius in the kitchen.

12:07.105 --> 12:08.451
A genius, Mom, really?

12:08.451 --> 12:09.556
It's the truth.

12:11.696 --> 12:14.043
You two are so
sweet, and I love

12:14.043 --> 12:15.286
that you think so highly of me,

12:15.286 --> 12:19.255
but I'm a city mouse,
not a country mouse.

12:19.255 --> 12:21.499
- For now.
- For always.

12:23.708 --> 12:25.745
I need to take my stuff
upstairs and get settled.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.436
Same room from
high school, right?

12:27.436 --> 12:31.095
Ah, you know, we haven't
rented that room out yet at all

12:31.095 --> 12:33.822
for any dates this next year.

12:33.822 --> 12:36.583
In case you might
change your mind.

12:36.583 --> 12:39.241
Oh, of course, because
that's what every 30-year-old

12:39.241 --> 12:41.174
fiercely independent
woman wants to do,

12:41.174 --> 12:43.486
live with and work
for her parents.

12:43.486 --> 12:46.420
Fierce independence
isn't incompatible

12:46.420 --> 12:48.250
with doing what
you love in a place

12:48.250 --> 12:50.148
that loves you back.

12:50.148 --> 12:52.530
You two are insufferable.

12:52.530 --> 12:54.256
I'm taking my stuff
upstairs before you try

12:54.256 --> 12:55.740
and dress me in a Santa hat.

12:55.740 --> 12:58.018
Oh, the Santa hat is
on your dresser, dear.

12:59.226 --> 13:01.125
Along with the
notes for the tour.

13:01.125 --> 13:02.609
No, no, no, no, please, no.

13:02.609 --> 13:05.025
I, I haven't done that
tour since I was 17

13:05.025 --> 13:06.371
and I hated it then.

13:06.371 --> 13:08.822
You better go get those notes.

13:08.822 --> 13:11.066
The tour starts in an hour.

13:11.066 --> 13:12.308
You know, child labor laws

13:12.308 --> 13:14.724
have been enforced
since the 1800s.

13:14.724 --> 13:18.073
Honey, you're 30.

13:18.073 --> 13:19.764
Thanks for reminding me, Mom.

13:19.764 --> 13:22.974
And we're country mice
now, and child labor laws,

13:22.974 --> 13:24.320
they don't apply on a farm.

13:26.564 --> 13:28.221
None of this is
going to change my mind

13:28.221 --> 13:29.739
about Christmas or this town.

13:31.189 --> 13:33.019
Why would we
want to change your mind?

13:33.019 --> 13:34.434
After all, we did raise you

13:34.434 --> 13:36.401
to be a fiercely
independent woman.

13:41.406 --> 13:44.340
It's so good to have her home.

13:44.340 --> 13:45.686
Was he cute?

13:45.686 --> 13:47.343
- Yeah.
- Super cute?

13:49.449 --> 13:51.900
Well yeah, but
that's not the point.

13:51.900 --> 13:53.833
He was a total jerk.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.145
Well, at first he
was nice but then,

13:57.353 --> 14:00.046
and then he gave me
a ticket.

14:00.046 --> 14:01.323
Can you believe that?

14:01.323 --> 14:03.290
Well, how fast were you going?

14:03.290 --> 14:05.810
- 51 in a 25.
- Kathy!

14:05.810 --> 14:07.053
I know. I know.

14:08.295 --> 14:09.572
Well, what did he
write you up for?

14:09.572 --> 14:10.988
Five over.

14:10.988 --> 14:13.093
Mm-hmm, he's a total jerk.

14:14.646 --> 14:16.407
You should call him.

14:17.304 --> 14:18.581
- What?
- Yes.

14:18.581 --> 14:20.238
I see them do it all
the time in the movies.

14:20.238 --> 14:21.826
His number's on the back
of the ticket, right?

14:21.826 --> 14:23.828
No, no, I will not.

14:24.794 --> 14:25.692
I will not.

14:27.728 --> 14:29.213
I gotta go.

14:29.213 --> 14:30.076
Bye.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.496
Your parents said
you'd be up here.

14:36.496 --> 14:37.393
Sandra!

14:40.741 --> 14:42.536
Merry Christmas, Kathy.

14:42.536 --> 14:44.159
Well, it's not Times Square,

14:44.159 --> 14:46.437
but I guess it's
a Merry Christmas.

14:46.437 --> 14:48.749
It's always a Merry
Christmas at the Holly Hotel.

14:48.749 --> 14:50.717
You are as bad as my parents.

14:51.994 --> 14:53.651
Have a seat. I'm
still unpacking.

14:55.377 --> 14:58.138
They are so happy to have
you back for the holidays.

14:58.138 --> 15:01.348
Well, you can't let them
know, but I'm happy to be back.

15:02.798 --> 15:04.938
Come up with any exciting
new dishes I can steal,

15:04.938 --> 15:07.113
I mean, borrow from you lately?

15:08.321 --> 15:09.770
I've actually been
eating a lot more

15:09.770 --> 15:10.910
than I've been cooking.

15:11.876 --> 15:15.259
- Still the food critic.
- Yes.

15:15.259 --> 15:17.295
I'm with the magazine still,

15:17.295 --> 15:21.299
but I'm up for a new
job at "The Times."

15:21.299 --> 15:24.578
You'd be the most
influential critic in New York.

15:24.578 --> 15:26.339
Well, nothing's definite yet,

15:26.339 --> 15:28.513
but I should know in a few days.

15:28.513 --> 15:30.205
I'm happy for you.

15:34.519 --> 15:36.832
- You don't look it.
- Maybe not.

15:36.832 --> 15:39.593
I just think you should be
in the kitchen with a spatula

15:39.593 --> 15:42.493
instead of on the dining
room floor with a pen.

15:42.493 --> 15:45.151
Do my parents pay you extra
to be their double agent,

15:45.151 --> 15:46.566
or do you just do that for free?

15:46.566 --> 15:48.913
Oh, I do it for
free. Definitely.

15:48.913 --> 15:50.846
Well, at least you're honest.

15:50.846 --> 15:53.055
So look,
I want to invite you

15:53.055 --> 15:56.196
into the kitchen with me,
anytime while you're here.

15:56.196 --> 15:59.924
There's room for only one
chef in the kitchen, Sandra.

15:59.924 --> 16:01.650
Except at Christmas.

16:01.650 --> 16:03.376
And before you ask, yes,

16:03.376 --> 16:07.000
your parents do pay me
extra to be this cheerful,

16:07.000 --> 16:08.484
but you can't let them know.

16:08.484 --> 16:11.211
I'd be this way for free,
even if they didn't.

16:11.211 --> 16:14.007
Well good, we can both keep
a secret from my parents.

16:15.250 --> 16:17.597
I just wanted to give
you an open invitation.

16:17.597 --> 16:19.461
You can join me
whenever you want.

16:19.461 --> 16:20.910
I'll think about it.

16:20.910 --> 16:23.361
Don't think about
it, just do it.

16:23.361 --> 16:25.018
Okay, Chef Nike.

16:26.537 --> 16:29.091
Oh, and if you happen to
do a review on this place,

16:29.091 --> 16:31.611
you'd better love my dishes.

16:31.611 --> 16:33.716
You taught me
everything I know, Sandra.

16:33.716 --> 16:35.235
How could I not?

16:35.235 --> 16:38.376
Just remember, I know where
you're staying if you don't.

16:57.464 --> 17:00.640
They haven't changed a
word since high school.

17:00.640 --> 17:04.230
The Holly hotel
was built in 1891.

17:04.230 --> 17:08.027
It has always been a
hotel and a restaurant.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.409
The original owner
was Mr. Hurst and,

17:13.377 --> 17:16.621
ladies and gentlemen, I
believe I have a stalker.

17:19.935 --> 17:22.765
Someone needs to make sure
the good people of Holly

17:22.765 --> 17:26.424
are safe from your
cyclone of recklessness.

17:28.426 --> 17:30.463
Grandma Williams and I
would like to take the tour

17:30.463 --> 17:34.363
before we sit for dinner
in this fine establishment.

17:34.363 --> 17:37.401
Grandma Williams
is perfectly capable

17:37.401 --> 17:40.507
of speaking for herself, Sonnie.

17:43.959 --> 17:44.856
Ooh, Sonnie.

17:44.856 --> 17:46.410
I like that, Grandma Williams.

17:46.410 --> 17:48.274
Do you mind if I
call him that too?

17:48.274 --> 17:50.138
Not at all.

17:50.138 --> 17:52.312
He thinks he's the bees knees

17:52.312 --> 17:54.521
because he gets to wear a badge.

17:55.971 --> 18:00.251
But I remember when his badges
were all made of plastic.

18:00.251 --> 18:03.427
You have my permission
to bring him down a peg.

18:03.427 --> 18:06.223
Well, you know, Sonnie
here gave me a ticket

18:06.223 --> 18:08.294
on the way into
town this morning.

18:08.294 --> 18:12.643
Right before Christmas?
That's outrageous.

18:12.643 --> 18:16.647
She was going 51 in a 25.

18:16.647 --> 18:19.408
But she's so pretty.

18:19.408 --> 18:23.723
Yeah, that's not how
the law works, Grandma.

18:23.723 --> 18:26.105
I have to continue
the tour now, Grandma.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.348
Don't worry about
that ticket, Missie.

18:28.348 --> 18:30.454
I'll work on him.

18:30.454 --> 18:31.800
Oh, Missie.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.597
Can I call her that too?

18:35.597 --> 18:40.464
Okay, can we get back to this
romance dance later, please?

18:40.464 --> 18:42.776
Oh, we're.

18:42.776 --> 18:45.676
Oh, oh no, that, we're not.

18:45.676 --> 18:47.126
Yeah, whatever.

18:50.543 --> 18:53.270
Um, you know what?

18:53.270 --> 18:56.169
Let's, follow me
into the, the bar.

18:56.169 --> 18:57.550
Let's go to the bar.

18:57.550 --> 19:00.173
This is the bar area.

19:00.173 --> 19:02.727
Now it has been
said that Mr. Hurst,

19:02.727 --> 19:05.592
the ghost of Mr.
Hurst, enjoys sitting

19:05.592 --> 19:09.355
in this very seat at
night, chatting it up.

19:09.355 --> 19:13.359
There was a very
tragic fire in 1913.

19:13.359 --> 19:16.879
Ownership then changed
over, the hotel was rebuilt

19:16.879 --> 19:21.884
and then almost to the
exact day, 65 years later,

19:22.782 --> 19:23.817
there was another tragic fire.

19:24.715 --> 19:26.441
Follow me into the next room.

19:26.441 --> 19:29.237
And this is the Alley Cat Club.

19:29.237 --> 19:33.655
We host poetry, open mic,
many great singers and bands,

19:33.655 --> 19:37.037
and on the weekends
we have comedy night.

19:37.037 --> 19:38.591
- Tell her.
- Stop, Dad,

19:38.591 --> 19:40.696
it's embarrassing.
- What's that?

19:40.696 --> 19:43.285
I'm actually gonna be
singing here on Christmas Eve.

19:43.285 --> 19:45.494
That's wonderful news.

19:45.494 --> 19:47.082
What about ghosts?

19:47.082 --> 19:49.153
Legend has it there's
actually two ghosts

19:49.153 --> 19:50.913
that live in the hotel with us.

19:50.913 --> 19:52.812
You can always sense a presence.

19:52.812 --> 19:55.746
Sometimes you'll
hear noises, voices,

19:55.746 --> 19:58.404
or see a shadow walk by.

19:58.404 --> 20:01.200
Mr. Hurst is actually one
of our most famous residents

20:01.200 --> 20:02.270
from the other realm.

20:04.306 --> 20:05.238
Do you smell that?

20:06.826 --> 20:09.069
Mr. Hurst was a very
heavy cigar smoker

20:09.069 --> 20:11.658
and some say you can
actually catch a hint of it

20:11.658 --> 20:12.797
when you're down here.

20:12.797 --> 20:15.317
All I smell is Pine-Sol.

20:17.043 --> 20:20.115
No doubt that's Mr. Hurst's
lady of the house, Nora.

20:20.115 --> 20:22.221
She's another one of
our prominent ghosts.

20:23.360 --> 20:25.293
Now, if you don't mind,
let's head upstairs.

20:26.432 --> 20:28.123
In addition to ghosts,

20:28.123 --> 20:31.747
our hotel has hosted a
sitting U.S. president.

20:31.747 --> 20:34.509
You'll see here, a
picture of the president,

20:34.509 --> 20:37.339
the first lady and my father
back when he had hair.

20:38.513 --> 20:41.343
During his reelection
campaign in 1992,

20:41.343 --> 20:44.277
the president actually
made our hotel a stop

20:44.277 --> 20:46.486
on his train tour of the state.

20:46.486 --> 20:48.868
I was in the
dining room with him.

20:48.868 --> 20:50.179
Were you really?

20:50.179 --> 20:54.391
Yes, he was one
good-looking man.

20:54.391 --> 20:55.737
Grandma.

20:55.737 --> 20:56.979
Well, he was.

20:58.498 --> 21:00.707
Well, now, if you
don't mind, follow me.

21:02.157 --> 21:04.849
And this is our train car room.

21:04.849 --> 21:07.093
Everything you see
here is authentic.

21:07.093 --> 21:09.095
My father actually
went to southern Ohio

21:09.095 --> 21:13.168
to get everything from
a 1910 Pullman rail car.

21:13.168 --> 21:17.034
We've had an abundance of
wedding proposals here.

21:17.034 --> 21:18.449
Come on in and take a look.

21:19.761 --> 21:22.419
And this is our hotel attic,

21:22.419 --> 21:25.180
where we have six bed
and breakfast rooms,

21:25.180 --> 21:27.769
all of which are
currently occupied,

21:27.769 --> 21:30.392
so I do apologize,
I can't show them,

21:30.392 --> 21:33.775
but if you follow me this way
to one of our banquet rooms,

21:33.775 --> 21:36.122
where we have weddings
and other large parties,

21:36.122 --> 21:38.987
we have an amazing
dinner planned for you.

21:42.439 --> 21:46.374
Do you believe in all that
ghost mumbo jumbo, Missie?

21:46.374 --> 21:48.030
It makes for a fun story.

21:49.204 --> 21:50.619
When I lived here
in high school,

21:50.619 --> 21:52.138
there were a few things

21:52.138 --> 21:55.383
that were not easily
explained though.

21:55.383 --> 21:56.591
I believe in ghosts.

21:57.833 --> 22:00.422
Sonnie here believes
in everything.

22:00.422 --> 22:02.666
He was 15 before I convinced him

22:02.666 --> 22:05.220
that there was no such thing-
- Grandma!

22:05.220 --> 22:06.497
What?

22:06.497 --> 22:08.050
Don't say things
like that out loud,

22:08.050 --> 22:09.500
you'll make them come true.

22:10.846 --> 22:13.711
Well, I think being a
true believer is sweet.

22:13.711 --> 22:16.404
True believers are
great for dating,

22:17.646 --> 22:19.717
but they're terrible
at paying the bills.

22:21.098 --> 22:24.066
I pay my bills, including
your dinner tonight.

22:25.309 --> 22:27.794
- Kathy, something happened.
- We need you.

22:27.794 --> 22:30.141
- Sandra burnt her hand.
- Badly.

22:30.141 --> 22:32.351
I don't think she can
finish dinner tonight.

22:32.351 --> 22:33.766
You have to take over.

22:33.766 --> 22:36.976
I, I, I can't,
I'm not prepared.

22:36.976 --> 22:38.426
I'm trained in first aid.

22:38.426 --> 22:39.772
Where is she? I'll take a look.

22:39.772 --> 22:41.843
In the kitchen. Come with me.

22:41.843 --> 22:44.052
Your grandmother can
stay. Dinner's on us.

22:45.778 --> 22:48.401
- Kathy.
- No, Mom, I can't.

22:48.401 --> 22:51.231
William?
- He's a sous chef.

22:51.231 --> 22:55.270
Really more of a line
cook, he's not that good.

22:55.270 --> 22:56.236
He'll be fine.

22:57.686 --> 22:59.101
Kath, please.

22:59.101 --> 23:00.931
Mom, boundaries.

23:06.039 --> 23:08.007
I knew we'd get out
of paying the bill.

23:34.654 --> 23:36.691
How was dinner,
Grandma Williams?

23:36.691 --> 23:37.726
It'll pass.

23:39.141 --> 23:40.419
I could've done better.

23:41.281 --> 23:43.283
Well, the thing is.

23:43.283 --> 23:45.941
The thing is I was
there when it happened.

23:45.941 --> 23:47.978
I'm 90, I'm not stupid.

23:47.978 --> 23:51.637
Yes, I, yes,
ma'am, I.

23:51.637 --> 23:52.569
But the thing is, I-

23:52.569 --> 23:55.157
I don't need excuses, dear.

23:55.157 --> 23:58.057
I needed five-star food.

23:58.057 --> 24:00.128
I think you have a future
in restaurant reviews.

24:00.128 --> 24:02.475
Future?

24:02.475 --> 24:05.167
When you get to
be as old as I am,

24:05.167 --> 24:07.584
the future is all in the past.

24:09.344 --> 24:11.380
You wanna talk about future?

24:11.380 --> 24:13.555
How do you feel about
that grandson of mine?

24:15.005 --> 24:19.423
Well, I, I don't know,
I, I don't really know him.

24:21.874 --> 24:25.878
He's handsome. He's kind.

24:27.051 --> 24:30.261
And he's got a job.
What's to know?

24:31.746 --> 24:36.716
Well, I, I don't, I
don't, I don't know.

24:37.337 --> 24:38.580
Sit down.

24:38.580 --> 24:40.927
I'll, I'll tell you a
few things about life.

24:40.927 --> 24:43.102
Oh no, no, I can't, but.

24:43.102 --> 24:45.242
That wasn't a question. Sit.

24:54.631 --> 24:56.184
Speak of the devil.

24:57.047 --> 24:59.187
Angels appear.

24:59.187 --> 25:02.397
Ha, nobody writing tickets

25:02.397 --> 25:05.158
two days before Christmas Eve

25:05.158 --> 25:07.471
can call themselves an angel.

25:07.471 --> 25:10.336
Yeah, but anyone
who puts up with you

25:10.336 --> 25:13.097
for seven days a week sure can.

25:13.097 --> 25:15.514
Puts up? Puts up?

25:16.653 --> 25:18.793
Come a little closer, Sonnie.

25:18.793 --> 25:21.209
I bet I can still
lean you over my knee.

25:23.038 --> 25:24.419
Thank you for
keeping Grandma company

25:24.419 --> 25:26.973
while I took Sandra to the ER.

25:26.973 --> 25:28.285
Sorry I couldn't
dine her tonight,

25:28.285 --> 25:30.943
but we're always on duty.

25:30.943 --> 25:33.152
Why don't you
find your courage

25:33.152 --> 25:37.915
and ask this pretty
girl out on a real date?

25:37.915 --> 25:38.778
Grandma.

25:40.193 --> 25:42.299
Yeah, why aren't you
doing that, Officer Matthew?

25:42.299 --> 25:44.681
You are afraid of
something, Sonnie boy.

25:45.958 --> 25:47.062
Grandma, please.

25:48.132 --> 25:49.720
What are you going to tell me?

25:49.720 --> 25:53.448
That you've got game and
I'm ruining it for you?

25:53.448 --> 25:55.657
Got a game?

25:55.657 --> 25:58.557
Seriously, Grandma, where do
you come up with these things?

26:00.248 --> 26:02.146
If it wasn't for me,

26:02.146 --> 26:05.356
you wouldn't be asking
this young lady for a date.

26:06.530 --> 26:08.705
Are you asking
me out on a date?

26:08.705 --> 26:10.499
I do all the work.

26:10.499 --> 26:14.055
He just stands in line
and waits to get the prize

26:14.055 --> 26:16.402
at the bottom of the
Cracker Jack box.

26:18.749 --> 26:23.582
Well, um, Kathy.

26:24.721 --> 26:27.137
Just say yes, Missie.

26:27.137 --> 26:29.449
I'm gonna expire
before he gets around

26:29.449 --> 26:32.142
to asking you for a date.

26:32.142 --> 26:35.145
Okay, fine, yes. Why not?

26:36.491 --> 26:37.941
I would love that.

26:37.941 --> 26:41.151
See, Sonnie, that's how you
ask someone out on a date.

26:42.462 --> 26:44.326
Well, I better
get her out of here

26:44.326 --> 26:46.846
before she finds a chapel
and has us married.

26:46.846 --> 26:48.676
You should be so lucky.

27:23.987 --> 27:25.126
But do you like him?

27:26.437 --> 27:27.438
I don't know.

27:28.992 --> 27:30.579
He was nice when I
was giving the tour,

27:30.579 --> 27:34.204
but I hardly know him.

27:34.204 --> 27:36.655
This could be so
great for you, Kathy.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.553
He could be the one.

27:38.553 --> 27:40.555
The one? Okay, stop Danielle.

27:40.555 --> 27:43.040
That is not practical.
I live in New York.

27:43.040 --> 27:47.458
Oh no, Kathy, what
did you text him?

27:47.458 --> 27:48.943
"Hi, Matthew.

27:48.943 --> 27:53.326
It's okay, I think we both know
that this isn't meant to be,

27:53.326 --> 27:55.743
but it was nice meeting you."

27:55.743 --> 27:57.296
Please give it another try.

27:59.056 --> 28:02.646
It was a nice daydream
while it lasted.

28:05.684 --> 28:06.719
Good night, Danielle.

28:19.249 --> 28:21.872
You went to bed rather
early last night, didn't you?

28:21.872 --> 28:23.460
I am 30 years old, Mom.

28:23.460 --> 28:25.393
Do they ever get too
old to worry about?

28:25.393 --> 28:27.498
If they do, I
wouldn't know it.

28:27.498 --> 28:30.329
Why didn't you go out with
that nice police officer?

28:30.329 --> 28:32.193
Well, he stood me up actually.

28:32.193 --> 28:34.643
He what? No.

28:34.643 --> 28:35.921
Stood you up?

28:35.921 --> 28:37.577
Yeah, I got a text
from him last night

28:37.577 --> 28:40.408
saying he had an emergency
call or something.

28:40.408 --> 28:43.894
Oh, well, you know,
he is a police officer.

28:43.894 --> 28:45.689
And very handsome.

28:45.689 --> 28:47.311
Did you see the
way he took care

28:47.311 --> 28:49.210
of his grandmother last night?

28:49.210 --> 28:51.384
That boy's a keeper, Kath.

28:51.384 --> 28:54.629
Okay, I'm gonna let him know
that you two are interested.

28:54.629 --> 28:57.494
It's not often you find
someone as grounded as he is.

31:51.564 --> 31:54.291
What
are we doing here?

31:54.291 --> 31:56.328
I have it on good information

31:57.812 --> 31:59.987
that you would like a meeting
with the chief of police.

32:01.160 --> 32:02.817
Oh, a little
birdie told you, huh?

32:03.749 --> 32:04.819
Something like that.

32:10.618 --> 32:12.171
Hey, Bob.
- Hey, bro.

32:19.592 --> 32:22.871
Well, if it isn't my
favorite youngest officer.

32:24.045 --> 32:27.117
I'm your only
youngest officer.

32:27.117 --> 32:29.499
Doesn't mean you
can't be my favorite.

32:29.499 --> 32:30.845
And who might you be?

32:30.845 --> 32:32.122
I'm Kathy.

32:32.122 --> 32:34.538
My parents actually
own the Holly Hotel.

32:34.538 --> 32:36.471
- George and Chrissy's girl.
- Yes, sir.

32:36.471 --> 32:38.059
Well, it's so
nice to meet you.

32:38.059 --> 32:40.027
I will be sure to tell
them we finally met

32:40.027 --> 32:42.995
when I come by for the
annual Christmas Eve dinner.

32:42.995 --> 32:47.068
Yeah, actually Dad's got
something super special planned.

32:47.068 --> 32:50.175
So special that he won't
even tell me what it is.

32:50.175 --> 32:52.108
Well, I can confirm

32:52.108 --> 32:55.663
that there is a national
security element, actually,

32:55.663 --> 32:57.285
to the dinner this year.

32:57.285 --> 33:02.118
And it is going to be a
very big deal for this town.

33:02.118 --> 33:03.636
National security?

33:03.636 --> 33:05.086
Probably shouldn't
have said that.

33:05.086 --> 33:07.295
Do me a favor, let's
keep that just between us

33:07.295 --> 33:09.435
and please don't tell
your dad I said so.

33:09.435 --> 33:11.403
Your secret's safe with me.

33:11.403 --> 33:13.301
And as much as I
enjoy entertaining

33:13.301 --> 33:16.615
new people in my office,
what brings you in today

33:16.615 --> 33:18.203
on your day off, Matthew?

33:18.203 --> 33:21.620
Well, Miss Kutlenios wanted
to file a formal complaint

33:21.620 --> 33:24.036
with the police force, sir.

33:24.036 --> 33:25.969
Miss Kutlenios, really?

33:25.969 --> 33:29.662
Well, I did say it
was a formal complaint.

33:30.698 --> 33:32.251
What seems to be the trouble?

33:32.251 --> 33:34.633
There's no trouble,
really, it's just, um,

33:36.117 --> 33:39.224
I just can't keep my lead foot
off the accelerator, is all.

33:39.224 --> 33:43.918
Let me guess, he caught
you just coming into town?

33:43.918 --> 33:46.955
I was hiding behind
the welcome sign.

33:46.955 --> 33:49.475
How many times have
we had this conversation

33:49.475 --> 33:52.064
where we park in
front of the sign,

33:52.064 --> 33:53.824
where the speed limit reduces?

33:53.824 --> 33:55.826
This is not to be
a speed trap town.

33:55.826 --> 33:58.898
We wanna welcome people
when they come into town.

33:58.898 --> 34:01.004
So just how
fast were you going?

34:02.902 --> 34:05.077
51 in a 25.

34:05.077 --> 34:08.943
51 in a 25, well,
that is a bit reckless.

34:10.082 --> 34:11.670
That's what I said.

34:11.670 --> 34:14.983
But still it is Christmas.

34:16.433 --> 34:19.816
And if you do promise to
obey all of the other laws

34:19.816 --> 34:21.576
and ordinances in our community,

34:21.576 --> 34:24.648
this is the citation he
wrote you.

34:24.648 --> 34:26.098
Merry Christmas, Kathy.

34:26.995 --> 34:28.928
Merry Christmas, chief.

34:30.689 --> 34:32.898
Kathy, it's amazing
to finally meet you

34:32.898 --> 34:34.693
and I'm sure I'll
see you again soon.

34:34.693 --> 34:35.970
You as well, sir.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.079
Tell me something.

34:43.046 --> 34:44.530
Okay.

34:44.530 --> 34:45.807
Why do you stay in New York

34:45.807 --> 34:47.809
doing that food critic thing,

34:47.809 --> 34:50.881
when everyone says you're
so good at being a chef?

34:52.090 --> 34:53.919
You don't pull
punches, do you?

34:53.919 --> 34:57.025
Can't, too much of Grandma
Williams blood in me.

34:57.025 --> 35:00.339
Hmm, she does explain a few
things about you, doesn't she?

35:00.339 --> 35:01.306
All good, I hope.

35:02.790 --> 35:06.345
Jury's still out, but I'm
leaning in the good direction.

35:06.345 --> 35:07.588
You really think you got away

35:07.588 --> 35:09.348
without answering that
question, don't you?

35:09.348 --> 35:10.315
Maybe I do?

35:12.075 --> 35:13.007
Afraid to answer.

35:15.251 --> 35:16.838
Why do people do what they do?

35:18.357 --> 35:23.293
I mean, it's hard to
follow your dreams.

35:23.293 --> 35:25.226
You have to really
believe in yourself.

35:26.262 --> 35:27.677
Think about it this way.

35:27.677 --> 35:30.887
How many people do
you know in your life

35:30.887 --> 35:32.026
that draw really well?

35:35.133 --> 35:40.103
I don't know,
maybe like 10 or 15.

35:40.103 --> 35:42.140
And of those 10 or 15,

35:42.140 --> 35:44.659
how many of them have
art hanging in a museum?

35:44.659 --> 35:46.592
You want your food
to hang in a museum?

35:46.592 --> 35:48.387
Don't be silly.

35:48.387 --> 35:50.009
I'm sorry, I couldn't help it-

35:50.009 --> 35:51.804
Grandma Williams
in you, I know.

35:54.013 --> 35:57.224
Are you saying your skills
don't rise to the level of art?

35:57.224 --> 35:58.880
Ouch.

35:58.880 --> 36:00.365
Well, yeah, that's
what I'm saying,

36:00.365 --> 36:03.022
but it hurts worse when
you have to say it for me.

36:03.022 --> 36:04.645
Does it have to be art though?

36:06.647 --> 36:09.305
What if your skill's good
enough to make people happy?

36:11.583 --> 36:12.377
I need more.

36:14.102 --> 36:15.276
So what about you?

36:15.276 --> 36:17.209
Have you always dreamt
of being a deputy

36:17.209 --> 36:19.073
on the Holly Police Force?

36:19.073 --> 36:23.146
I'm just a regular
guy with a good heart.

36:23.146 --> 36:24.975
Except for when you're
giving out speeding tickets

36:24.975 --> 36:26.149
right before Christmas.

36:26.149 --> 36:29.221
You were going 51 in a 25.

36:29.221 --> 36:31.913
- Ah, that's reckless.
- I know.

36:34.744 --> 36:36.780
So you're saying you
don't have any dreams?

36:41.751 --> 36:42.752
I didn't say that.

36:43.994 --> 36:45.168
Well, let's have
it then, officer,

36:45.168 --> 36:46.963
before I have to
publicly cite you

36:46.963 --> 36:49.966
for being as emotionally stunted
as the rest of your gender.

36:54.177 --> 36:55.730
It's embarrassing.

36:55.730 --> 36:58.216
Oh, like admitting that
I'll never be as good

36:58.216 --> 37:00.183
at the one thing I
love as I want to be?

37:00.183 --> 37:01.322
Embarrassing like that?

37:03.428 --> 37:04.325
You got me.

37:06.051 --> 37:08.398
Well, let's have it
then, Officer Perfect.

37:08.398 --> 37:09.641
What are your dreams?

37:09.641 --> 37:11.643
I love this so much.

37:11.643 --> 37:13.300
Okay, tell me more. Go on.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.129
He said.

37:15.129 --> 37:16.475
I wanna be a good husband

37:18.650 --> 37:19.996
and a good father one day.

37:21.825 --> 37:26.796
I want a house full of kids

37:27.969 --> 37:29.247
who can't get to sleep
on Christmas Eve.

37:32.284 --> 37:36.012
I want to hold my best friend

37:37.462 --> 37:39.567
in the whole wide world's hand

37:39.567 --> 37:42.605
while we watch our children
unwrap the presents

37:42.605 --> 37:43.675
on Christmas morning.

37:44.952 --> 37:47.713
That is the sweetest
thing I have ever heard.

37:47.713 --> 37:48.956
Okay, keep telling me more.

37:48.956 --> 37:51.441
And I told him
that he's amazing,

37:51.441 --> 37:53.788
and so incredibly good-looking.

37:55.273 --> 37:59.069
And that I'm sure he's gonna
make someone so happy one day,

37:59.069 --> 38:03.591
but I just don't think
that I'm the girl for him.

38:03.591 --> 38:05.213
And now you've ruined it.

38:05.213 --> 38:08.700
- Danny.
- No, you've ruined my night

38:08.700 --> 38:11.772
and you are literally
ruining Christmas.

38:11.772 --> 38:12.635
Goodbye.

38:24.923 --> 38:26.269
You've got to stop doing that.

38:26.269 --> 38:28.167
If I knew how, I would.

38:29.341 --> 38:30.860
I have to hand
it to you though.

38:32.482 --> 38:35.382
Bringing Kathy back here,
setting her up with Matthew.

38:36.417 --> 38:37.625
If you can pull it off,

38:37.625 --> 38:40.248
it will be your greatest
Christmas miracle yet.

38:41.215 --> 38:43.286
They're right for each other.

38:43.286 --> 38:45.737
It will all work out in the end.

38:45.737 --> 38:46.841
That would be nice.

38:49.706 --> 38:53.020
And how have you been
passing the endless time?

38:56.195 --> 38:57.162
I'm bored, Nora.

38:58.543 --> 39:01.304
Pull a wire here and
I pull a wire there.

39:02.409 --> 39:04.411
I just can't make heads or tails

39:04.411 --> 39:06.447
out of this modern technology.

39:07.621 --> 39:09.347
I never know which
light I'm turning off.

39:11.659 --> 39:14.628
Well, how about pitching in

39:14.628 --> 39:18.252
and helping me help
these two youngsters?

39:18.252 --> 39:21.117
Why not? We're a team, right?

39:22.083 --> 39:24.085
Like George and Chrissy.

39:24.085 --> 39:26.294
And Kathy and Matthew.

39:28.262 --> 39:31.576
This place makes love shine.

39:31.576 --> 39:34.441
Truer words, Nora
dear, truer words.

39:35.649 --> 39:37.754
Shall we retire
to the basement?

39:37.754 --> 39:38.617
We shall.

39:40.032 --> 39:42.483
I love you, Mr. Hurst.

39:42.483 --> 39:44.554
I love you, dear Nora.

39:57.049 --> 39:57.878
Hi.

39:58.913 --> 39:59.742
Hey.

40:01.226 --> 40:02.779
This is awkward.

40:02.779 --> 40:03.677
Maybe a little.

40:04.919 --> 40:07.128
It's nice to see you though.

40:07.128 --> 40:09.614
- What are you?
- My grandma's inside.

40:09.614 --> 40:12.099
She sent me a text asking
me to join her for tea.

40:13.341 --> 40:15.516
Yeah, she's not inside.

40:17.725 --> 40:18.588
Are you sure?

40:19.451 --> 40:20.625
Oh, yeah.

40:20.625 --> 40:21.971
Actually she just
texted me and asked me

40:21.971 --> 40:23.628
to meet her on the front porch.

40:23.628 --> 40:26.769
Something about going
last-minute shopping.

40:26.769 --> 40:28.322
- I see.
- Yep.

40:29.288 --> 40:32.637
So here we are.

40:32.637 --> 40:33.465
Here we are.

40:34.742 --> 40:36.226
That was nice of you though.

40:37.296 --> 40:38.470
What's that?

40:38.470 --> 40:40.748
To agree to take her shopping.

40:40.748 --> 40:42.163
You hardly know her.

40:43.786 --> 40:44.752
She's a nice lady.

40:46.202 --> 40:50.551
The best. She's also
a pathological liar.

40:51.966 --> 40:53.071
She means well though.

40:54.175 --> 40:54.969
So what now?

40:57.972 --> 40:59.180
Oh, boy.

41:00.458 --> 41:01.251
What?

41:03.253 --> 41:04.462
I think I have an idea.

41:10.329 --> 41:11.779
Whoa.

41:11.779 --> 41:14.886
Excuse me, sir,
is there any chance

41:14.886 --> 41:17.233
you were reserved
by a Mrs. Williams?

41:17.233 --> 41:18.993
Absolutely not.

41:18.993 --> 41:21.962
I was sent from the
beyond by Mrs. Hurst.

41:21.962 --> 41:25.172
Ha, Mr. And Mrs. Hurst,
the ghost from Holly Hotel.

41:25.172 --> 41:26.898
Remember the tour?

41:26.898 --> 41:29.901
Ah, right. So?

41:31.178 --> 41:32.662
Grandma Williams.

41:33.939 --> 41:35.354
So are you gonna climb onboard

41:35.354 --> 41:37.425
or do I have to go back
to lighting candles

41:37.425 --> 41:38.530
when nobody's looking?

41:38.530 --> 41:39.393
May as well.

41:40.428 --> 41:42.223
Sure. Why not?

42:01.277 --> 42:02.520
Oh, it's cold out here.

42:09.078 --> 42:10.113
Just to stay warm.

42:11.874 --> 42:13.738
What girl could
object to warmth?

42:15.360 --> 42:16.534
It's a beautiful day.

42:18.121 --> 42:19.675
Glad to be spending it with you.

42:22.505 --> 42:26.509
Have you heard the
forecast for Christmas yet?

42:28.235 --> 42:30.720
Yeah, hasn't snowed here

42:30.720 --> 42:32.653
on actual Christmas
in a few years.

42:33.827 --> 42:36.830
You must be a good
luck charm for Holly.

42:39.522 --> 42:40.454
Just for Holly?

42:42.456 --> 42:43.319
Maybe me too.

42:54.261 --> 42:55.193
Nothing to say?

42:57.436 --> 42:58.783
Just enjoying the moment

43:01.648 --> 43:03.304
and to be totally
honest with you,

43:04.927 --> 43:06.549
I don't really know what to say.

43:08.689 --> 43:10.035
I'm having a lot of thoughts,

43:10.035 --> 43:14.212
but I'm not so good at talking.

43:14.212 --> 43:15.800
You didn't seem to
have that problem earlier

43:15.800 --> 43:19.493
when you painted the perfect
picture of Christmas morning.

43:19.493 --> 43:23.393
Yeah, that didn't work out
so well for me though, did it?

43:25.292 --> 43:26.776
I'm sorry, I-

43:26.776 --> 43:27.777
It's okay.

43:30.642 --> 43:32.023
Well, maybe you should tell me

43:32.023 --> 43:33.576
what it would be like with you.

43:34.750 --> 43:37.545
Maybe I'll dream about
it when I'm in New York.

43:37.545 --> 43:39.858
A lot of Grandma Williams.

43:41.273 --> 43:43.137
- Be serious.
- I am.

43:50.731 --> 43:53.527
- Matthew?
- Yeah?

43:56.772 --> 43:59.153
What are we doing here?

43:59.153 --> 44:00.430
I don't know,

44:01.777 --> 44:05.228
but I'm not objecting
to the warmth either.

44:05.228 --> 44:08.473
I leave for New
York in a few days.

44:08.473 --> 44:10.544
Oh, I will deal with
that when it happens.

44:10.544 --> 44:12.546
I mean, if we keep
going down this path.

44:14.272 --> 44:16.136
I will have a
broken heart for sure.

44:19.933 --> 44:21.659
And you won't be the only one.

44:23.177 --> 44:25.663
I've never been so happy
to hear of a broken heart.

44:30.012 --> 44:32.946
Maybe we should just stop
spending so much time together.

44:34.154 --> 44:34.982
Makes sense.

44:36.225 --> 44:37.329
Very rational.

44:39.228 --> 44:41.575
I mean, do you want to?

44:41.575 --> 44:44.026
- No.
- I don't either,

44:44.026 --> 44:47.823
but we have to agree that
this is only temporary.

44:47.823 --> 44:52.379
I mean, I have a job,
possibly my, my dream job

44:52.379 --> 44:54.208
as the lead editor
at "The Times."

44:54.208 --> 44:57.625
I mean, and my apartment,
it's all in New York.

44:59.662 --> 45:02.700
You have a job, maybe
a new job, and a place.

45:05.150 --> 45:09.914
But I didn't hear you mention
anything about having a life.

45:14.539 --> 45:17.887
I thought you said
you were bad at talking?

45:17.887 --> 45:19.337
I have my moments.

45:37.320 --> 45:38.321
Kathy!

45:38.321 --> 45:41.566
Do you know where the, oh, um,

45:42.601 --> 45:44.189
sorry, I, I didn't see anything.

45:48.435 --> 45:50.264
Goodbye, Officer Perfect.

45:51.679 --> 45:52.853
Goodbye, Miss Perfect.

45:56.236 --> 45:57.651
I'm sorry.

46:00.343 --> 46:01.517
About what?

46:01.517 --> 46:03.726
About this.

46:03.726 --> 46:04.969
About everything.

46:05.970 --> 46:07.143
I shouldn't have almost.

46:08.317 --> 46:09.525
I shouldn't have led you on.

46:09.525 --> 46:11.596
I shouldn't have led myself on.

46:13.011 --> 46:16.566
I just need to rip
the Band-Aid off.

46:16.566 --> 46:19.328
I shouldn't have
almost kissed.

46:23.297 --> 46:24.402
Goodbye, Matthew.

46:28.061 --> 46:29.510

Matthew, wait, what
are you doing tomorrow?

46:58.712 --> 46:59.299
I don't know.

47:00.231 --> 47:01.404
Thought it might be a good day

47:01.404 --> 47:05.132
to alphabetize my spice rack.

47:08.032 --> 47:10.689
Name one spice that
starts with the letter A

47:10.689 --> 47:12.312
and maybe I'll believe you.

47:13.623 --> 47:14.624
Al, falfa.

47:18.076 --> 47:21.183
'Cause everyone loves alfalfa
on their steak and potatoes.

47:21.183 --> 47:23.530
You name a spice
that begins with A.

47:23.530 --> 47:24.600
Arrowroot.

47:24.600 --> 47:25.981
Can you do B?

47:25.981 --> 47:28.086
- Basil.
- C?

47:28.086 --> 47:29.294
Cinnamon.

47:29.294 --> 47:31.158
Can you do all of them?

47:31.158 --> 47:31.987
Oh, yeah.

47:34.472 --> 47:37.993
How about Z?

47:41.237 --> 47:43.101
Ah!
- Za'atar.

47:44.413 --> 47:45.552
Is that a real thing?

47:46.725 --> 47:48.624
Yeah, if you don't
believe me, look it up.

47:51.834 --> 47:52.731
X.

47:53.940 --> 47:55.458
Xylocarp.

47:55.458 --> 47:58.220
Oh, come on, that sounds
like a prescription drug.

48:00.153 --> 48:00.981
Do you concede?

48:04.502 --> 48:05.330
Yes.

48:06.884 --> 48:08.333
Well, thank goodness,

48:08.333 --> 48:11.233
because I thought you
were gonna ask me about Q.

48:11.233 --> 48:13.649
Q, right, why didn't
I think of that?

48:15.099 --> 48:18.654
Why don't you, um, come here
for lunch with me tomorrow?

48:20.932 --> 48:22.830
What happened to
the Band-Aid thing?

48:26.317 --> 48:28.077
Should I bring my spice rack?

48:28.077 --> 48:29.458
Just the alfalfa.

48:37.949 --> 48:40.331
Nora, darling.

48:41.332 --> 48:42.781
You gave me quite a fright.

48:44.887 --> 48:47.062
You have never gotten
used to the habit

48:47.062 --> 48:50.030
of me appearing and
disappearing, have you?

48:50.030 --> 48:53.309
It's even more disconcerting
now than when we were alive.

48:54.276 --> 48:55.484
When we were alive,

48:55.484 --> 48:57.762
it was just because
you were not very good

48:57.762 --> 48:59.350
at paying attention to me.

48:59.350 --> 49:00.868
That's not true.

49:00.868 --> 49:02.111
When we were alive,

49:02.111 --> 49:05.597
I paid attention to
nothing else but you.

49:05.597 --> 49:06.909
I know it, dear.

49:06.909 --> 49:08.497
I was trying to rile you.

49:09.463 --> 49:10.568
You were succeeding.

49:12.052 --> 49:15.469
I have been knowing you
for over a hundred years.

49:15.469 --> 49:18.817
I have a secret map to
all of your buttons.

49:19.991 --> 49:21.751
A hundred years.

49:21.751 --> 49:23.270
Has it truly been that long?

49:24.340 --> 49:25.963
Seems no more than a day.

49:27.550 --> 49:30.657
That's as sweet as what
that boy said to that girl.

49:30.657 --> 49:33.384
Well, it's part of the
magic of this place, isn't it?

49:34.419 --> 49:35.248
It is.

49:36.490 --> 49:38.285
Did you enjoy
the carriage ride?

49:38.285 --> 49:40.184
Oh, it was a lovely evening,

49:40.184 --> 49:44.015
even if a bit chilly, and
thank you for riding up front,

49:44.015 --> 49:46.397
so I could sit in the
back seat with them.

49:46.397 --> 49:50.090
We almost got her to
say that she would stay.

49:50.090 --> 49:52.023
Well, she'll get
there, don't you worry?

49:52.023 --> 49:52.990
I am worried.

49:54.129 --> 49:56.407
She doesn't believe
in herself yet.

49:56.407 --> 49:59.582
Well, she's cooking
lunch for Matthew tomorrow.

49:59.582 --> 50:01.101
That's a good sign.

50:01.101 --> 50:03.793
How long has it been since
she's graced our kitchens?

50:05.036 --> 50:09.937
12 years. That
girl sure could cook.

50:09.937 --> 50:11.629
Yes, she can.

50:11.629 --> 50:14.356
She just needs to find
the joy in it again.

50:14.356 --> 50:17.842
Well, that's what
this place is all about.

50:17.842 --> 50:19.499
Exactly.

50:19.499 --> 50:21.604
Are you sure you
know what you're doing?

50:22.709 --> 50:25.125
Have I ever been wrong yet?

50:25.125 --> 50:27.403
Ah, don't answer that.

50:29.716 --> 50:31.752
Well, what about that job?

50:31.752 --> 50:35.998
We both feel it in the
air, she's going to get it.

50:35.998 --> 50:39.139
The entire day of
Christmas depends on it.

50:39.139 --> 50:41.728
Oh, I sure hope you
know what you're doing.

50:41.728 --> 50:44.075
Don't I always?

50:44.075 --> 50:46.905
And don't answer
that one either.

50:48.079 --> 50:49.736
Shall we go downstairs?

50:49.736 --> 50:50.564
We shall.

50:51.565 --> 50:52.773
Who's playing tonight?

50:52.773 --> 50:54.741
Oh, I don't know.

50:54.741 --> 50:56.570
It'll be a surprise
for both of us.

50:56.570 --> 50:59.918
Ah.

51:08.893 --> 51:11.585
You got in late last
night, didn't you?

51:11.585 --> 51:13.035
I am 30 years old, Mom.

51:14.209 --> 51:15.658
Do they ever get too
old to worry about?

51:15.658 --> 51:17.695
If they do, I
wouldn't know it.

51:17.695 --> 51:20.077
That young officer
is so handsome.

51:21.388 --> 51:22.941
That boy's a keeper, Kathy.

51:22.941 --> 51:26.635
Okay, happy Groundhogs
Day to you too.

51:26.635 --> 51:30.984
♪ Make your list
and check it twice ♪

51:32.399 --> 51:34.125
And we're done.

51:35.022 --> 51:37.749
That looks amazing.

51:37.749 --> 51:41.719
Presentation is important,
but the real test is the taste.

51:41.719 --> 51:43.893
I have no doubts.

51:48.484 --> 51:53.455
Wow. I don't know what you
call this, but it's amazing.

51:54.732 --> 51:56.941
Thank you. I added a
little extra alfalfa.

51:58.598 --> 52:01.118
You're not gonna let
that one go, are you?

52:01.118 --> 52:03.534
Nope, I'm gonna hold
onto that one for a while.

52:04.914 --> 52:08.125
Glad I could be of service.

52:09.816 --> 52:11.024
Speaking of service,

52:11.956 --> 52:13.785
I've said that word twice

52:13.785 --> 52:15.822
in front of my parents
since I've returned

52:15.822 --> 52:18.618
and both times they
just started laughing

52:18.618 --> 52:19.929
and then said that
they can't wait

52:19.929 --> 52:21.276
for the Christmas secret?

52:22.449 --> 52:24.865
Do you have any idea
what has them so giggly?

52:26.591 --> 52:31.113
No, I think my captain
knows, but I honestly don't.

52:33.529 --> 52:34.772
And why do they,

52:34.772 --> 52:37.878
why do they say secret
every time I say service

52:37.878 --> 52:39.121
and then start laughing?

52:40.122 --> 52:41.882
I have no clue.

52:41.882 --> 52:43.746
You're much smarter than I am.

52:43.746 --> 52:46.163
I'll always be known
as the sweet one

52:46.163 --> 52:47.888
in any conversation about us.

52:49.338 --> 52:51.168
Oh, there's an us now, huh?

52:52.583 --> 52:55.724
Well, technically anytime
there's a we there's also an us.

52:58.140 --> 53:00.763
I don't know if that
comment made any sense or not.

53:00.763 --> 53:03.801
And that's what I
have a talent for,

53:03.801 --> 53:06.217
disguising the
intelligence of my answers.

53:10.877 --> 53:13.983
Well, maybe I should just
let myself be surprised.

53:16.123 --> 53:18.505
Well, think of it like
a Christmas present.

53:19.437 --> 53:21.888
Sure, you could shake the box

53:21.888 --> 53:25.098
and you might be able to
figure out what's inside,

53:25.098 --> 53:28.170
but wouldn't it just be
better to wait and unwrap it?

53:31.346 --> 53:32.485
I like that.

53:33.520 --> 53:36.420
It means a lot to my dad anyway.

53:36.420 --> 53:37.593
So let him have this.

53:42.495 --> 53:44.151
You know what we need?

53:44.151 --> 53:48.363
Grandma Williams to bust in
here and publicly insult me,

53:48.363 --> 53:51.228
til I find my courage to ask
you to see me again tonight?

53:52.505 --> 53:54.023
That too.

53:54.023 --> 53:55.991
But I was thinking maybe we
should go inside the kitchen

53:55.991 --> 53:59.063
and make some of the hotel's
famous chocolate mousse.

54:00.167 --> 54:02.618
Oh, that sounds fantastic.

54:06.001 --> 54:06.967
Mom, Dad.

54:09.038 --> 54:11.248
Hey, you kids
enjoying your lunch?

54:11.248 --> 54:13.353
She is a wonderful chef.

54:13.353 --> 54:14.975
Don't I know it.

54:14.975 --> 54:16.494
Thank you.

54:16.494 --> 54:18.047
I actually wanted to talk
to you guys about that.

54:18.047 --> 54:21.672
As nice as William is,
I think it's obvious

54:21.672 --> 54:26.573
that he's not gonna be able
to do the Christmas dinner.

54:26.573 --> 54:27.747
- Well.
- No.

54:28.782 --> 54:31.923
No, no, he, he cannot.

54:31.923 --> 54:36.238
Well, I was thinking, if the
offer's still on the table,

54:37.412 --> 54:40.207
I would be the chef
for the evening?

54:40.207 --> 54:43.521
Oh, honey, this
is wonderful news.

54:43.521 --> 54:46.835
Kathy, you are seriously
saving Christmas.

54:46.835 --> 54:49.355
This dinner is so important.

54:49.355 --> 54:51.115
You are saving the hotel.

54:51.115 --> 54:53.255
This is the best
Christmas present.

54:56.845 --> 54:58.225
They certainly seem happy.

54:59.157 --> 55:01.298
Indeed. Me too.

55:02.609 --> 55:04.301
I'm actually looking
forward to it.

55:06.303 --> 55:08.097
Can I ask you something?

55:08.097 --> 55:11.929
And know beforehand, I am
actually being serious for once.

55:11.929 --> 55:14.828
Officer Matthew Williams,
are you going to propose?

55:16.347 --> 55:19.833
No, we would need Grandma
Williams' blessing for that.

55:19.833 --> 55:21.835
Oh, you're not gonna get that.

55:21.835 --> 55:23.837
She doesn't think you're
good enough for me.

55:25.425 --> 55:26.288
Give her time.

55:27.116 --> 55:28.359
She'll come around.

55:28.359 --> 55:30.534
So what were you gonna
ask me, Captain Serious?

55:30.534 --> 55:32.605
Do you feel like
there's been something

55:33.778 --> 55:35.746
pushing us together
this Christmas?

55:36.954 --> 55:40.198
What, like some sort
of Christmas magic?

55:41.338 --> 55:43.754
Yeah, something like that.

55:44.996 --> 55:46.929
You know I don't
believe in that stuff.

55:48.621 --> 55:50.277
How have we gotten so close

55:50.277 --> 55:52.107
in such a short
amount of time then?

55:53.315 --> 55:56.249
I don't know, the
magic of pheromones

55:56.249 --> 55:57.595
and facial symmetry, maybe.

55:59.425 --> 56:01.288
You are such a scientist.

56:01.288 --> 56:02.738
Reason first, I always say.

56:03.912 --> 56:06.224
I'm gonna ask
you something else.

56:06.224 --> 56:08.641
And I don't want you to think,

56:08.641 --> 56:10.021
I just want you to feel.

56:11.782 --> 56:14.371
That's gonna be a little
difficult for me, but I'll try.

56:18.444 --> 56:19.824
Will you give us a chance?

56:22.413 --> 56:23.380
What do you mean?

56:24.691 --> 56:27.901
I mean us, you and me.

56:29.696 --> 56:33.217
Will you allow what is
happening to keep happening

56:35.495 --> 56:37.601
until we become
all that we can be?

56:39.844 --> 56:42.260
I mean, we might be beautiful.

56:45.540 --> 56:46.713
We would be beautiful.

56:48.681 --> 56:49.578
Then let's try.

56:51.649 --> 56:52.443
I'd like that.

57:00.278 --> 57:02.315
Kathy, this is amazing.

57:02.315 --> 57:05.180
It's like you're living
in a Christmas film.

57:05.180 --> 57:06.975
But all those
movies are the same.

57:06.975 --> 57:09.322
Big city girl goes
home for Christmas.

57:09.322 --> 57:10.634
To plan her wedding.

57:10.634 --> 57:12.601
Or run her parents' bakery.

57:12.601 --> 57:14.914
Where she falls
in love with a guy.

57:14.914 --> 57:17.157
- A veterinarian.
- Who wears flannel.

57:18.469 --> 57:20.506
But Matthew and I
haven't gone on a date

57:20.506 --> 57:22.197
at a Christmas tree farm yet.

57:22.197 --> 57:24.924
There's always a Christmas
tree farm in those movies.

57:24.924 --> 57:26.477
There is always tomorrow.

57:27.685 --> 57:29.411
How many of those
movies have you seen?

57:29.411 --> 57:30.999
All of them?

57:30.999 --> 57:32.656
I see all of them.

57:32.656 --> 57:33.726
I don't doubt that.

57:35.175 --> 57:38.731
You have to admit
you love them too.

57:38.731 --> 57:42.424
Okay, maybe I do.

57:54.712 --> 57:56.093
Hello?

57:56.093 --> 57:57.819
Is this
Kathy Kutlenios?

57:57.819 --> 57:59.165
This is she.

57:59.165 --> 58:01.236
Hi Kathy, this is
Elaine from "The Times."

58:01.236 --> 58:03.480
You interviewed
with me last Friday.

58:03.480 --> 58:05.343
Yes, Elaine, how are you?

58:05.343 --> 58:06.690
I'm very good.

58:06.690 --> 58:09.175
Also, I have some
exciting news for you.

58:11.384 --> 58:12.903
I've spoken with
the other editors

58:12.903 --> 58:14.974
and we've decided to
offer you the job.

58:16.423 --> 58:20.220
That's, that's, ah,
I'm listening, I'm sorry.

58:20.220 --> 58:22.153
You don't seem very excited.

58:22.153 --> 58:23.154
No, I am.

58:24.811 --> 58:26.986
There's a new restaurant
called The Villa Americano

58:26.986 --> 58:28.332
opening in SoHo tonight.

58:28.332 --> 58:29.851
Now, I remember when
you interviewed,

58:29.851 --> 58:31.680
you said you'd be visiting
your parents this week,

58:31.680 --> 58:33.475
but we really need
you back in town

58:33.475 --> 58:35.857
to cover the grand opening.
- Well.

58:35.857 --> 58:37.790
That's not gonna
be a problem, is it?

58:38.929 --> 58:40.068
No, no, it won't.

58:41.207 --> 58:43.140
I'm sure your family
will understand.

58:43.140 --> 58:45.487
This is the type of opportunity
to further your career

58:45.487 --> 58:47.834
that doesn't come
around that often.

58:47.834 --> 58:48.870
They'll understand.

58:50.319 --> 58:51.838
Then you accept?

58:51.838 --> 58:53.357
Yes, of course.

58:53.357 --> 58:55.704
Excellent, my assistant will
book your flight right away.

58:55.704 --> 58:58.120
Pack your bags and
head to the airport.

58:58.120 --> 59:00.778
Will do. Merry Chri.

59:04.126 --> 59:05.265
Merry Christmas.

59:15.862 --> 59:17.830
He can't handle
the Christmas meal.

59:18.762 --> 59:20.557
He's gonna screw it all up.

59:20.557 --> 59:21.765
Kathy has to do it.

59:21.765 --> 59:22.559
George.

59:24.561 --> 59:25.389
I'm so sorry.

59:27.943 --> 59:30.325
I really don't wanna
abandon you guys like this.

59:31.498 --> 59:32.948
This is the most
important thing

59:32.948 --> 59:35.123
that's happened to this
hotel since we've owned it.

59:36.607 --> 59:39.472
I just, I don't think I
can fly out in the morning.

59:39.472 --> 59:41.232
They're calling
for feet of snow.

59:42.579 --> 59:45.271
George, stop
making her feel bad.

59:45.271 --> 59:48.343
This is her dream job, we
can't interfere with that.

59:54.383 --> 59:56.213
You're right.
You're always right.

59:58.215 --> 1:00:00.010
I'm just a worrywart.

1:00:00.010 --> 1:00:01.252
And you know that.

1:00:02.426 --> 1:00:06.016
I've been that way since 2008,

1:00:06.016 --> 1:00:08.950
when the polls had
me up by 10 points

1:00:08.950 --> 1:00:12.539
and I still lost my seat
because of that big blue wave.

1:00:13.989 --> 1:00:17.268
Sweetheart, this isn't an
election, it's just a dinner.

1:00:22.135 --> 1:00:25.276
Congratulations.
I'm happy for you.

1:00:25.276 --> 1:00:27.037
I had to take the job.

1:00:27.037 --> 1:00:28.694
It's my dream job,
like you said.

1:00:29.867 --> 1:00:32.180
I'm sorry if
I'm being selfish.

1:00:32.180 --> 1:00:33.560
Tell us about your new job.

1:00:34.561 --> 1:00:36.909
It's. Nothing really to say.

1:00:38.289 --> 1:00:39.463
It's what I've been working for

1:00:39.463 --> 1:00:40.775
the entire time I
was in New York.

1:00:42.190 --> 1:00:46.056
I just can't believe
it's finally coming true.

1:00:46.056 --> 1:00:47.954
- Good things come-
- To good people.

1:00:49.818 --> 1:00:50.750
Are you guys sure.

1:00:50.750 --> 1:00:52.614
Are you sure I'm a good person?

1:00:52.614 --> 1:00:54.271
Of course you are honey.

1:00:55.306 --> 1:00:56.998
Absolutely.

1:00:56.998 --> 1:01:00.380
It's just that being
here the last few days

1:01:00.380 --> 1:01:02.175
has really gotten to me.

1:01:03.660 --> 1:01:06.145
When we first moved here
after Dad lost the election,

1:01:06.145 --> 1:01:08.112
and when I was in high school,

1:01:08.112 --> 1:01:11.115
I just thought this
place was horrible.

1:01:11.115 --> 1:01:15.948
Moving here from DC, it
was like moving into a, a,

1:01:15.948 --> 1:01:18.709
a one bedroom apartment
from a mansion.

1:01:18.709 --> 1:01:20.573
I couldn't even breathe the air.

1:01:22.989 --> 1:01:24.922
But the last few days.

1:01:24.922 --> 1:01:26.268
With Matthew?

1:01:27.545 --> 1:01:31.860
With him, with you
guys, this place,

1:01:34.345 --> 1:01:37.486
I finally feel like
I, I came home.

1:01:39.109 --> 1:01:41.559
But I never felt like
that when I was in DC.

1:01:41.559 --> 1:01:45.391
And in New York, I mean,
that's just a place

1:01:45.391 --> 1:01:47.704
I, I thought I was
chasing my dreams

1:01:49.567 --> 1:01:50.914
and it just never
felt like home,

1:01:50.914 --> 1:01:53.364
no matter how long
I lived there, and.

1:01:53.364 --> 1:01:57.058
Not like a Dorothy and her
magic slippers type home.

1:01:57.058 --> 1:01:58.507
There's no place like home.

1:02:01.890 --> 1:02:05.825
No matter how far
away from home you get,

1:02:05.825 --> 1:02:08.103
you can always come back to it.

1:02:08.103 --> 1:02:09.277
We love you.

1:02:09.277 --> 1:02:10.071
- Yeah.
- I love you too.

1:02:14.454 --> 1:02:15.628
We love you.

1:02:37.374 --> 1:02:41.343
Hello, Grandma. I'm coming in.

1:02:41.343 --> 1:02:43.414
You don't knock anymore?

1:02:43.414 --> 1:02:44.726
I've been knocking.

1:02:45.865 --> 1:02:49.455
Hmm, must be something
wrong with my ears.

1:02:49.455 --> 1:02:53.390
I didn't expect you until it
was time to go to the dinner.

1:02:53.390 --> 1:02:56.980
Well, things didn't work
out the way I'd hoped.

1:02:58.291 --> 1:03:01.053
Did you let that
girl get away?

1:03:01.053 --> 1:03:04.159
I didn't let her. She
chose New York over me.

1:03:05.091 --> 1:03:07.404
Why did you give her a choice?

1:03:07.404 --> 1:03:08.785
What was I supposed to do?

1:03:09.924 --> 1:03:11.546
Kidnap her?

1:03:11.546 --> 1:03:13.375
If that's what it took.

1:03:15.067 --> 1:03:17.724
I can always count on your
sense of humor, Grandma.

1:03:18.691 --> 1:03:20.106
I wasn't joking.

1:03:21.280 --> 1:03:22.799
Her heart wasn't
in this place.

1:03:24.007 --> 1:03:27.044
She sent me a text,
Grandma, a text!

1:03:30.289 --> 1:03:33.257
"Matt. Thank you.

1:03:33.257 --> 1:03:35.397
Work called with
a big promotion.

1:03:35.397 --> 1:03:37.468
Have to leave today.

1:03:37.468 --> 1:03:40.713
It was a pleasant dream
while it lasted. Kathy."

1:03:41.645 --> 1:03:43.854
A text, are you kidding me?

1:03:43.854 --> 1:03:48.790
I'm 90 years old, I know
true love when I see it.

1:03:48.790 --> 1:03:51.448
Well, maybe you were
wrong this one time.

1:03:51.448 --> 1:03:53.036
I am never wrong.

1:03:55.417 --> 1:03:57.488
So what are you
gonna do about it?

1:03:57.488 --> 1:03:59.490
What can I do?

1:03:59.490 --> 1:04:01.492
She's on her way to
New York right now.

1:04:04.081 --> 1:04:05.255
What?

1:04:05.255 --> 1:04:07.395
You want me to chase
her down at the airport?

1:04:07.395 --> 1:04:10.225
A text. You sent me a text.

1:04:10.225 --> 1:04:13.919
You chased me down in a
cop car and pulled me over.

1:04:13.919 --> 1:04:15.955
Matthew, don't act
like I'm the crazy one.

1:04:15.955 --> 1:04:18.164
When is the last time
you've been in love?

1:04:19.648 --> 1:04:22.030
Don't make this harder
than it needs to be.

1:04:22.030 --> 1:04:24.412
I've been in love
once, right now,

1:04:24.412 --> 1:04:26.621
today, with you, that's it.

1:04:26.621 --> 1:04:29.555
So yeah, I'm out
here in the cold,

1:04:29.555 --> 1:04:32.834
outside my jurisdiction
abusing my police powers,

1:04:32.834 --> 1:04:35.009
but that's not crazy.

1:04:35.009 --> 1:04:36.803
Crazy is you driving off

1:04:36.803 --> 1:04:39.220
and pretending like you
don't feel the same way.

1:04:40.359 --> 1:04:41.808
Don't make me cry, Matthew.

1:04:42.913 --> 1:04:43.741
I, I, can't-
- Kathy.

1:04:46.123 --> 1:04:47.090
I'm sorry.

Maybe just one drink?

1:05:48.703 --> 1:05:51.085
You do look like you
could use a friend.

1:05:51.085 --> 1:05:52.638
Come on and pull up a stool.

1:06:11.622 --> 1:06:14.487
You're worried that you
haven't been a very good father.

1:06:16.386 --> 1:06:19.976
Well, yes, as
a matter of fact.

1:06:19.976 --> 1:06:21.908
How did-
- I doubt that it's true.

1:06:24.566 --> 1:06:25.912
It's true.

1:06:25.912 --> 1:06:27.880
We have two daughters.

1:06:29.330 --> 1:06:32.505
Victoria is a senior in
college, out in Colorado.

1:06:34.024 --> 1:06:36.440
She got snowed in this year,
so she won't be joining us.

1:06:38.270 --> 1:06:42.170
But I was so excited
when Kathy, my oldest,

1:06:42.170 --> 1:06:43.689
announced she was coming home.

1:06:45.346 --> 1:06:49.074
I didn't raise them
here. Should have.

1:06:50.972 --> 1:06:53.699
Should have stayed in local
government or business,

1:06:55.149 --> 1:06:59.636
but I ran for Congress, and
for 10 years DC was their home.

1:07:01.879 --> 1:07:03.916
They didn't get the
benefit of this town.

1:07:06.988 --> 1:07:08.024
Or a good father.

1:07:10.026 --> 1:07:11.579
They're doing well now though.

1:07:12.821 --> 1:07:16.446
Um, I suppose.
Kathy, my oldest.

1:07:16.446 --> 1:07:19.242
I know.

1:07:20.415 --> 1:07:21.934
Do I know you?

1:07:21.934 --> 1:07:26.145
Oh, we've been in the same
room together many times.

1:07:26.145 --> 1:07:28.320
Just never really talked though.

1:07:28.320 --> 1:07:30.149
But enough about me. Kathy?

1:07:31.426 --> 1:07:33.877
She's on her way
back to New York.

1:07:33.877 --> 1:07:36.949
She landed a big job
writing for "The Times."

1:07:36.949 --> 1:07:38.571
And you're not happy about it.

1:07:39.641 --> 1:07:41.264
I'm happy if she's happy.

1:07:42.334 --> 1:07:44.681
I'm just not
convinced that she is,

1:07:46.269 --> 1:07:49.272
but I'm too old to
tell her what to do,

1:07:50.514 --> 1:07:53.172
and she's too old for
any fatherly advice.

1:07:54.656 --> 1:07:58.039
I love her so much.

1:07:58.039 --> 1:07:59.868
I just want her to
have a good life.

1:08:02.457 --> 1:08:04.218
You're a good man, George.

1:08:04.218 --> 1:08:05.909
It's not too late.

1:08:05.909 --> 1:08:08.014
Everything will
work out in the end.

1:08:08.014 --> 1:08:11.880
Trust me, this place,
the town and the people,

1:08:11.880 --> 1:08:14.745
they just have a way of
changing us for the better.

1:08:16.230 --> 1:08:19.233
So have you been
to the hotel before?

1:08:19.233 --> 1:08:20.475
Oh, many times.

1:08:21.959 --> 1:08:23.099
Probably more than you.

1:08:25.963 --> 1:08:28.759
George! George,
what are you doing?

1:08:30.036 --> 1:08:32.556
We, ah, we.

1:08:32.556 --> 1:08:34.179
We?

1:08:34.179 --> 1:08:37.423
- There was a gentleman.
- Honey, we have work to do.

1:08:37.423 --> 1:08:38.873
Come on, right now.
- I, um.

1:08:38.873 --> 1:08:40.633
Let's go, the
door's gonna open soon

1:08:40.633 --> 1:08:41.876
and we have to get ready.

Okay, um, we'll just keep the
menu simple, grilled cheese.

1:10:57.770 --> 1:11:01.049
Grilled cheese?
Grilled cheese?

1:11:01.049 --> 1:11:04.432
Are you serious? This
is Christmas dinner.

1:11:04.432 --> 1:11:06.400
And tomato soup.

1:11:06.400 --> 1:11:07.884
Do we serve that warm or cold?

1:11:12.198 --> 1:11:13.407
It will be fine.

1:11:14.580 --> 1:11:17.134
Sara, you can make
our clam chowder soup?

1:11:17.134 --> 1:11:19.136
Yeah, no problem, um,

1:11:19.136 --> 1:11:21.173
but Sandra usually samples it

1:11:21.173 --> 1:11:22.623
and then adjusts
it a little bit.

1:11:22.623 --> 1:11:24.107
But you know how to do it,

1:11:24.107 --> 1:11:26.868
so however it comes out
tonight is how it comes out.

1:11:26.868 --> 1:11:28.214
Okay.

1:11:28.214 --> 1:11:31.356
William, you can make
our special salads?

1:11:31.356 --> 1:11:34.428
Yeah, I've made
that a hundred times.

1:11:34.428 --> 1:11:35.636
Good. Get to it.

1:11:36.809 --> 1:11:39.847
Now, who knows
how to roast duck?

1:11:41.089 --> 1:11:44.058
What if we put a ham
in the grilled cheese?

1:11:47.061 --> 1:11:48.959
What is going on in here?

1:11:48.959 --> 1:11:51.859
Kathy! What are
you doing here?

1:11:51.859 --> 1:11:54.379
Your plane should've
left an hour ago.

1:11:54.379 --> 1:11:55.932
It did.

1:11:55.932 --> 1:11:58.762
I just recognized I don't need
to take a plane to get home.

1:12:00.005 --> 1:12:02.594
Okay, let's get this
kitchen in order.

1:12:02.594 --> 1:12:05.079
Mom, you and Dad take
care of the dining room

1:12:05.079 --> 1:12:06.149
and I'll take care of this.

1:12:06.149 --> 1:12:07.737
Oh, thank heavens. Oh!

1:12:12.224 --> 1:12:13.950
Ladies and gentlemen.

1:12:13.950 --> 1:12:16.401
Can we have your
attention please?

1:12:16.401 --> 1:12:17.850
As you may know,

1:12:17.850 --> 1:12:20.232
we have two special
guests joining us tonight.

1:12:20.232 --> 1:12:22.061
And when we say special.

1:12:22.061 --> 1:12:25.133
We mean very special.

1:12:25.133 --> 1:12:28.551
Ladies and gentlemen,
give a round of applause

1:12:28.551 --> 1:12:30.725
to the president.
- And the first lady.

1:12:30.725 --> 1:12:32.796
Of the United
States of America.

1:12:33.832 --> 1:12:35.523
Hello, hello, how are you?

1:12:44.601 --> 1:12:46.327
Merry Christmas, everybody.

1:12:46.327 --> 1:12:47.915
How you doing? You all right?

1:12:47.915 --> 1:12:49.675
How you doing? How are you?

1:12:49.675 --> 1:12:51.263
How are you doing?

1:12:51.263 --> 1:12:53.955
So much, how's
everybody? You okay?

1:12:53.955 --> 1:12:54.991
How are you?

1:12:58.304 --> 1:12:59.996
It's been a while.

1:12:59.996 --> 1:13:01.963
Ah, since 2008, sir.

1:13:01.963 --> 1:13:03.758
You don't have to call me sir.

1:13:03.758 --> 1:13:05.311
It's just Tyler.

1:13:05.311 --> 1:13:06.485
You know, the same guy
that played cards with you

1:13:06.485 --> 1:13:08.798
in the basement
every Saturday night.

1:13:08.798 --> 1:13:12.560
Well, yes, sir, Mr.
President, ah, Tyler, I'll try.

1:13:14.182 --> 1:13:16.081
Chrissy, we really
appreciate you

1:13:16.081 --> 1:13:18.014
having us here at your hotel.

1:13:18.014 --> 1:13:21.569
Oh, any time, Mr. President,
it's an honor to have you.

1:13:21.569 --> 1:13:23.882
- It's Tyler.
- Tyler.

1:13:23.882 --> 1:13:25.159
All right.

1:13:25.159 --> 1:13:26.747
You know, we miss
you down in DC.

1:13:28.334 --> 1:13:31.268
We really need good
people down there.

1:13:32.442 --> 1:13:35.652
Well, you know, I
was there 10 years

1:13:35.652 --> 1:13:37.689
and I think they
had enough of me.

1:13:37.689 --> 1:13:41.624
And frankly, I've
had enough of DC.

1:13:41.624 --> 1:13:44.454
Well, I have some cabinet
positions opening up

1:13:45.628 --> 1:13:48.113
and I'd love to
have a spot for you.

1:13:48.113 --> 1:13:50.184
We're happy here, Tyler.

1:13:50.184 --> 1:13:51.392
That's all right.

1:13:51.392 --> 1:13:52.842
If anything changes
you let me know.

1:13:52.842 --> 1:13:55.085
- Will do.
- Now, your hotel,

1:13:55.085 --> 1:13:58.157
this place is just incredible.

1:13:58.157 --> 1:13:59.711
Thank you so much, thank you.

1:13:59.711 --> 1:14:01.747
You really done a great
job putting this together.

1:14:01.747 --> 1:14:03.818
We love it here.
The town is beautiful.

1:14:03.818 --> 1:14:07.339
The people are so lovely
and warm, it's, it's home.

1:14:07.339 --> 1:14:09.134
Well, we really
appreciate you having us.

1:14:09.134 --> 1:14:12.240
We have no plans of
going anywhere again.

1:14:12.240 --> 1:14:13.103
This is it.

1:14:14.277 --> 1:14:15.865
I see that. Okay.

1:14:18.419 --> 1:14:21.146
The last entree
has left the kitchen.

1:14:21.146 --> 1:14:24.667
You all did such a great
job, thank you so much.

1:14:24.667 --> 1:14:26.531
I can't believe how
flexible everyone was

1:14:26.531 --> 1:14:28.464
changing the entree
at the last minute.

1:14:29.982 --> 1:14:32.916
Now let's keep our focus as
we get the desserts out and.

1:14:35.160 --> 1:14:35.988
Matthew?

1:14:36.886 --> 1:14:39.820
Kathy, you came back?

1:14:41.062 --> 1:14:44.307
I realized everything
I wanted was right here.

1:14:52.453 --> 1:14:53.937
- Kathy!
- Oh, come on!

1:14:55.387 --> 1:14:58.735
- You can kiss her later.
- When, when is that?

1:14:58.735 --> 1:14:59.943
Kathy, you did it.

1:14:59.943 --> 1:15:03.015
You did it! The
meal was wonderful.

1:15:03.015 --> 1:15:04.638
The president wants
to talk to you.

1:15:04.638 --> 1:15:07.433
Of the United States?

1:15:07.433 --> 1:15:09.781
Yes. Where, where
have you been?

1:15:09.781 --> 1:15:11.541
Wait, the president?

1:15:11.541 --> 1:15:13.543
I can't, I can't
see him like this.

1:15:13.543 --> 1:15:16.028
Why not? You remember him?

1:15:16.028 --> 1:15:18.583
Well, yeah, he was
the congressman then,

1:15:18.583 --> 1:15:20.585
now he's the president.

1:15:20.585 --> 1:15:21.724
You'll do fine.

1:15:22.932 --> 1:15:24.140
Oh, my God, I'm,
I'm so nervous.

1:15:24.140 --> 1:15:25.762
Will you go with me?

1:15:25.762 --> 1:15:27.005
Of course.

1:15:27.005 --> 1:15:29.179
Okay, I gotta change.

1:15:33.183 --> 1:15:34.599
How do I look?

1:15:34.599 --> 1:15:37.774
Wow. You look gorgeous.

1:15:40.156 --> 1:15:42.779
Is, is that little Kathy?

1:15:42.779 --> 1:15:45.471
Isn't she stunning? Look at her!

1:15:47.439 --> 1:15:49.165
Let's give it up for the chef.

1:15:57.967 --> 1:16:01.384
Now, get over and give
your Uncle Tyler a hug.

1:16:01.384 --> 1:16:05.664
My goodness, I haven't seen
you in, oh my, 12 years.

1:16:05.664 --> 1:16:06.907
Oh, my goodness.

1:16:06.907 --> 1:16:08.633
You know, I've been
all over the world

1:16:08.633 --> 1:16:11.118
and I must say this meal

1:16:11.118 --> 1:16:14.570
was probably the best
I've ever had in my life.

1:16:14.570 --> 1:16:16.088
Thank you, Mr. President.

1:16:16.088 --> 1:16:19.747
Oh, it's Uncle Tyler to
you, always Uncle Tyler.

1:16:19.747 --> 1:16:23.095
I am so proud of you, I
don't know what to do.

1:16:23.095 --> 1:16:26.858
Now, who is this man lucky
enough to hold your hand?

1:16:26.858 --> 1:16:28.722
Matthew, Mr. President.

1:16:28.722 --> 1:16:30.551
It's nice meeting
you, Matthew.

1:16:30.551 --> 1:16:33.002
You know, you're
incredibly lucky

1:16:33.002 --> 1:16:36.212
to have this young lady
as your girlfriend.

1:16:36.212 --> 1:16:37.489
Pretty smart guy.

1:16:38.421 --> 1:16:40.423
You must have voted for me, huh?

1:16:43.046 --> 1:16:46.015
I want everyone to
join us downstairs

1:16:46.015 --> 1:16:48.327
and we're gonna read
some Christmas poems.

1:16:48.327 --> 1:16:50.916
"The Night before
Christmas." Let's go.

1:17:10.142 --> 1:17:11.592
She didn't get on the plane.

1:17:13.283 --> 1:17:14.768
Kathy didn't get on the plane.

1:17:18.530 --> 1:17:20.601
"Was the night
before Christmas

1:17:20.601 --> 1:17:22.430
when all through the house

1:17:22.430 --> 1:17:24.570
not a creature was stirring,

1:17:24.570 --> 1:17:26.331
not even a mouse."

1:17:38.101 --> 1:17:39.378
You did it, Missie.

1:17:39.378 --> 1:17:40.897
Thank you, Sonnie.

1:17:40.897 --> 1:17:44.004
"The stockings were hung
by the chimney with care

1:17:44.004 --> 1:17:48.077
in hopes that St. Nicholas
soon would be there."

1:17:48.077 --> 1:17:50.079
Am I seeing what I
think I'm seeing out there?

1:17:50.079 --> 1:17:53.979
"The children were nestled
all snug in their beds

1:17:53.979 --> 1:17:58.777
while visions of sugarplums
danced in their heads.

1:17:58.777 --> 1:18:01.918
And Mama in her 'kerchief
and I in my cap,

1:18:03.402 --> 1:18:06.198
had just settled our brains
for a long winter's nap."

1:18:08.269 --> 1:18:09.719
It's snowing.

1:18:09.719 --> 1:18:13.274
"When out on the lawn
there arose such a clatter,

1:18:13.274 --> 1:18:16.864
I sprang from my bed to
see what was the matter.

1:18:16.864 --> 1:18:20.385
Away to the window
I flew like a flash,

1:18:20.385 --> 1:18:24.182
tore open the shutters,
and threw up the sash."

1:18:24.182 --> 1:18:25.873
It's gonna be a
white Christmas.

1:18:27.012 --> 1:18:28.738
Of course, it is.

1:18:28.738 --> 1:18:33.329
"The moon on the breast
of the new fallen snow

1:18:33.329 --> 1:18:36.781
gave the luster of
midday to objects below.

1:18:38.472 --> 1:18:42.683
When what to my wandering
eyes should appear,

1:18:42.683 --> 1:18:46.583
but a miniature sleigh,
and eight tiny reindeer."

1:18:47.826 --> 1:18:48.724
You know.

1:18:50.518 --> 1:18:51.347
What?

1:18:53.038 --> 1:18:55.661
I truly feel like
I'm finally home

1:18:55.661 --> 1:18:57.180
for the first time in my life.

1:18:58.561 --> 1:19:01.909
"With a little old
driver so lively and quick,

1:19:01.909 --> 1:19:05.741
I knew in a moment
it must be St. Nick.

1:19:06.949 --> 1:19:10.746
More rapid than eagles
his coursers they came,

1:19:10.746 --> 1:19:14.750
and he whistled and shouted
and called them by name.

1:19:14.750 --> 1:19:17.407
Now Dasher, now Dancer!

1:19:17.407 --> 1:19:19.133
Now Prancer and Vixen!

1:19:20.134 --> 1:19:22.723
On Comet, on Cupid!

1:19:22.723 --> 1:19:24.760
On Donner and Blitzen!"

1:19:26.796 --> 1:19:28.487
I love the way
you hold my hand.

1:19:29.972 --> 1:19:33.113
Well, I am under strict
orders from the president.

1:19:33.113 --> 1:19:34.286
I know, right?

1:19:34.286 --> 1:19:35.943
It might be a
capital crime not to.

1:19:35.943 --> 1:19:39.360
"To the top of the porch,
to the top of the wall.

1:19:39.360 --> 1:19:43.986
Now dash away, dash
away, dash away all!

1:19:43.986 --> 1:19:48.128
As dry leaves that before
the wild hurricane fly,

1:19:48.128 --> 1:19:52.270
when they meet with an
obstacle, mount to the sky,

1:19:53.754 --> 1:19:56.999
so up to the housetop
the coursers they flew,

1:19:58.448 --> 1:20:01.486
with the sleigh full of
toys and St. Nicholas too."

1:20:02.970 --> 1:20:05.835
Are you gonna be able to put
up with this reckless driver?

1:20:09.666 --> 1:20:12.980
"And then in a twinkling,
I heard on the roof,

1:20:12.980 --> 1:20:16.052
the prancing and pawing
of each little hoof.

1:20:17.571 --> 1:20:20.298
As I drew in my head,
and was turning around,

1:20:21.678 --> 1:20:24.958
down the chimney St.
Nicholas came with a bound.

1:20:26.476 --> 1:20:29.894
He was dressed in all fur
from his head to his foot,

1:20:29.894 --> 1:20:34.070
and his clothes were all
tarnished with ashes and soot."

1:20:34.070 --> 1:20:38.212
Matthew, I love you too.

1:20:39.558 --> 1:20:42.492
"A bundle of toys he
had flung on his back,

1:20:42.492 --> 1:20:46.738
and he looked like a peddler
just opening his pack.

1:20:46.738 --> 1:20:48.947
His eyes, how they twinkled.

1:20:48.947 --> 1:20:51.156
His dimples, how merry.

1:20:51.156 --> 1:20:53.607
His cheeks were like roses.

1:20:53.607 --> 1:20:56.610
His droll little mouth
was drawn up like a bow,

1:20:58.094 --> 1:21:02.305
and the beard on his chin
was white as the snow."

1:21:02.305 --> 1:21:04.790
Well, are you
gonna say it or not?

1:21:04.790 --> 1:21:08.380
"The stump of a pipe he
held tight in his teeth,

1:21:08.380 --> 1:21:12.591
and the smoke it encircled
his head like a wreath.

1:21:14.559 --> 1:21:18.287
He had a broad face,
and a little round belly

1:21:18.287 --> 1:21:22.084
that shook when he laughed
like a bowl full of jelly."

1:21:22.084 --> 1:21:23.499
Kathy Kutlenios.

1:21:25.121 --> 1:21:26.571
Matthew Williams?

1:21:26.571 --> 1:21:30.057
"And I laughed when I
saw him in spite of myself.

1:21:31.300 --> 1:21:33.681
A wink of his eye and
a twist of his head

1:21:34.890 --> 1:21:38.203
soon gave me to know I
had nothing to dread.

1:21:39.687 --> 1:21:42.311
He spoke not a word but
went straight to his work,

1:21:43.760 --> 1:21:48.213
and filled all the stockings,
then turned with a jerk."

1:21:54.633 --> 1:21:56.428
Will you marry me?

1:21:56.428 --> 1:21:59.707
"And laying his
finger aside of his nose

1:21:59.707 --> 1:22:03.953
and giving a nod, up
the chimney he rose.

1:22:05.437 --> 1:22:09.407
He sprang to his sleigh,
to his team gave a whistle,

1:22:10.787 --> 1:22:14.170
and away they flew like
the down of a thistle.

1:22:16.207 --> 1:22:20.211
But I heard him exclaim ere,
as he drove out of sight."

1:22:21.384 --> 1:22:22.765
Yes, I would
love nothing more.

1:22:23.800 --> 1:22:25.906
"Merry Christmas to all

1:22:27.770 --> 1:22:31.291
and all a good night."

1:22:34.052 --> 1:22:35.536
Thank you. Thank you.

1:22:35.536 --> 1:22:38.954
Merry Christmas,
everybody. Merry Christmas.

1:23:05.359 --> 1:23:08.259
Maybe next Christmas
we'll have a baby.

1:23:08.259 --> 1:23:10.019
Wouldn't that be lovely?

1:23:10.019 --> 1:23:12.332
It would, it surely would.
