01:16.674 --> 01:18.942
Got you, beastie.

01:20.177 --> 01:21.211
I wouldn't have
woke you up

01:21.213 --> 01:22.679
if it wasn't
a real emergency.

01:22.681 --> 01:23.980
It's fine.

01:23.982 --> 01:25.181
I was having
this wild dream, though.

01:25.183 --> 01:26.649
Erica was dressed as
Princess Leia,

01:26.651 --> 01:28.151
and I was doing this thing
with my light saber--

01:28.153 --> 01:29.319
Aah!

01:29.321 --> 01:30.987
Security camera
footage, please?

01:36.327 --> 01:38.127
Okay... coming online now.

01:42.633 --> 01:44.067
Oh, the little bugger.

01:44.069 --> 01:46.236
Took the words
right out of my mouth.

01:46.238 --> 01:49.038
It's going into Will's room.

01:49.040 --> 01:52.542
So I wasn't its first stop
of the evening.

01:52.544 --> 01:53.376
Fast forward.

01:57.548 --> 01:59.249
Your bedroom.

01:59.251 --> 02:00.183
Oh no.

02:02.987 --> 02:05.588
Aw, man.
Did that thing...?

02:05.590 --> 02:07.156
One way to be sure.

02:09.193 --> 02:10.627
Yeah, but wouldn't I
have woken up?

02:10.628 --> 02:12.662
Well, not necessarily.

02:12.664 --> 02:15.164
The device administers
a local anesthetic

02:15.166 --> 02:16.733
before it punctures
the skin.

02:17.669 --> 02:19.535
Damn little
brain sucker...

02:19.537 --> 02:21.137
Oh, dear.

02:35.027 --> 02:36.760
You've gotta be kidding me.

02:36.762 --> 02:38.362
I wish I were.

02:38.364 --> 02:39.463
But it already
sucked my brain once.

02:39.465 --> 02:42.433
Well, it was interrupted,
if you recall.

02:42.435 --> 02:45.970
Invisible albino ninjas.
How could I forget?

02:47.573 --> 02:49.540
Sorry, I haven't
been sleeping well.

02:51.042 --> 02:52.743
How come
you get off scot-free?

02:52.745 --> 02:54.745
I'm just lucky,
I guess.

02:54.747 --> 02:56.046
Well, I suspect if I hadn't
nabbed it when I did,

02:56.048 --> 02:58.849
it might still be
making its rounds.

02:58.851 --> 03:00.417
Well, aside from
the obvious creep factor,

03:00.419 --> 03:01.385
I don't really feel
any different.

03:01.387 --> 03:02.753
Yeah, me neither.

03:02.755 --> 03:03.887
I still remember
my name.

03:03.889 --> 03:05.656
Still hate anchovies.

03:05.658 --> 03:07.891
The device isn't designed
to drain your brain,

03:07.893 --> 03:09.727
it simply downloads
your consciousness

03:09.729 --> 03:11.261
into its memory bank.

03:11.263 --> 03:11.962
You know, I know that's
supposed to reassure us,

03:11.964 --> 03:12.830
but...

03:12.832 --> 03:14.131
You're both fine.

03:14.133 --> 03:15.532
If I hadn't caught it
in the act,

03:15.534 --> 03:16.634
you probably wouldn't have
even known this had happened.

03:16.636 --> 03:19.737
Yeah, how do you
think it got loose?

03:19.739 --> 03:20.571
Good question.

03:20.573 --> 03:21.805
Its compartment
doesn't appear

03:21.807 --> 03:23.073
to have been
tampered with.

03:23.075 --> 03:24.875
No, the electronic lock
is working perfectly.

03:24.877 --> 03:26.777
Except for the part
where it got out.

03:26.779 --> 03:28.112
Yeah...

03:28.114 --> 03:29.480
The only thing
I can figure

03:29.482 --> 03:30.714
is the computer sent
a release code to the container.

03:30.716 --> 03:32.016
Why would it do that?

03:32.018 --> 03:33.484
I don't know.

03:35.553 --> 03:37.054
Oh. On it.

03:41.861 --> 03:43.661
Why is this so hard?

03:43.663 --> 03:45.062
Do you remember
a few days ago,

03:45.064 --> 03:46.163
when the lawn sprinklers
wouldn't shut off?

03:46.165 --> 03:47.297
Yesterday, the security door
in the hallway

03:47.299 --> 03:49.133
kept going up and down
and up and down...

03:49.135 --> 03:51.835
Yeah, it's a glitch in
the maintenance program.

03:51.837 --> 03:52.736
It happens sometimes.

03:53.572 --> 03:55.739
That's the front gate.

03:55.741 --> 03:57.174
What?

03:57.176 --> 03:58.942
It's 2:30 in the morning.
Who is it?

03:58.944 --> 04:00.911
I'm a little
busy here.

04:00.913 --> 04:02.112
It's one of Magnus' old codes.

04:02.114 --> 04:04.682
I'll get it.

04:04.684 --> 04:07.851
Ooh, you're really
pissing me off!

04:07.853 --> 04:09.787
You think there's
a connection

04:09.789 --> 04:12.122
between all these glitches
and the spiderbot?

04:12.124 --> 04:13.490
That's what
I'm trying to find out,

04:13.492 --> 04:16.026
but every time I try
to back-trace the anomaly--

04:17.495 --> 04:18.862
really?

04:18.863 --> 04:20.831
What is it?

04:20.833 --> 04:22.065
A hidden sector?

04:22.067 --> 04:23.100
One you didn't create?

04:23.102 --> 04:24.168
Would I be
this surprised

04:24.170 --> 04:25.602
if I created it?

04:25.604 --> 04:26.603
And this thing has
big giant firewalls.

04:27.872 --> 04:29.073
It's just...

04:30.809 --> 04:32.242
Speak.

04:32.244 --> 04:35.212
Who has the ability
to hide an entire system sector

04:35.214 --> 04:36.914
in a system that I built?

04:41.820 --> 04:42.686
Tesla, isn't it--

04:42.688 --> 04:45.222
Where is he?

04:45.224 --> 04:46.223
Research lab.

04:46.225 --> 04:47.624
Thank you.

04:47.626 --> 04:49.059
Henrich!

04:54.199 --> 04:55.499
What the hell do you think
you're playing at?

04:55.501 --> 04:57.034
Oh, you!

04:57.036 --> 04:58.669
I see now.

04:58.671 --> 04:59.803
Oh, dear God.

05:01.173 --> 05:03.741
And the inmates
are running the asylum, hmm?

05:03.743 --> 05:04.608
Nikola?

05:04.610 --> 05:06.176
He did it.

05:06.178 --> 05:07.010
What?

05:07.012 --> 05:07.845
He did it.

05:07.847 --> 05:08.779
The sprinklers?

05:08.781 --> 05:09.780
The hidden sector.

05:09.782 --> 05:10.881
How did you find it?

05:10.883 --> 05:12.015
What are you hiding?

05:12.017 --> 05:13.851
Would you all please
stop speaking in code?

05:13.853 --> 05:15.252
The computer issues
we've been having lately.

05:15.254 --> 05:16.220
They're not issues.

05:16.222 --> 05:17.187
They're-they're
glitches.

05:17.189 --> 05:18.155
Nikola,

05:18.157 --> 05:19.356
what have you done?

05:19.358 --> 05:20.190
Why do you always assume
it's my fault?

05:20.192 --> 05:22.593
Oh, let me count the ways.

05:22.595 --> 05:23.427
He roofied our system.

05:23.429 --> 05:25.129
Did you?

05:25.131 --> 05:26.630
It should have been fine.
It <i> would</i> have been fine,

05:26.632 --> 05:28.932
if Enrico the wonder wolf
hadn't have gone nosing around.

05:30.102 --> 05:31.401
What is it this time?

05:31.403 --> 05:32.236
Berate me
if you must--

05:32.238 --> 05:33.737
I must.

05:33.739 --> 05:36.106
The only reason we're facing
this unfortunate situation

05:36.108 --> 05:37.908
is because
I tried to save your life.

05:38.911 --> 05:41.311
This is going to be good.

05:41.313 --> 05:43.680
You do recall your first foray
into Hollow Earth,

05:43.682 --> 05:44.748
when your tracking beacon
disappeared.

05:44.750 --> 05:46.250
Go on.

05:46.252 --> 05:49.019
Well, fearing the worst,
I naturally sprang into action,

05:49.021 --> 05:50.287
but the only way

05:50.289 --> 05:51.288
that I could get
the proper coordinates

05:51.290 --> 05:52.623
to send Druitt down,

05:52.625 --> 05:54.992
I had to patch that little
Praxian brain spider

05:54.994 --> 05:56.693
into your computer system.

05:56.695 --> 05:57.961
Yeah, but that was
months ago,

05:57.963 --> 05:59.263
and you
unpatched it.

05:59.265 --> 06:00.664
Well, I guess
it left behind

06:00.666 --> 06:01.632
a little Easter egg.

06:01.634 --> 06:02.766
A virus?

06:02.768 --> 06:04.067
No, no, no,
nothing like that.

06:04.069 --> 06:05.235
Oh, good.

06:06.805 --> 06:08.939
It's a sentient organic nanite.

06:08.941 --> 06:10.607
What?

06:10.609 --> 06:12.643
Oh, not good.
Not good.

06:12.645 --> 06:16.113
It didn't cross your mind
to mention this to anyone?

06:16.115 --> 06:17.414
Well, you're
all so busy,

06:17.416 --> 06:19.483
and besides,
I quarantined it.

06:19.485 --> 06:21.118
In a hidden sector.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.486
Behind a veritable
Fort Knox

06:22.488 --> 06:23.353
of firewalls.

06:23.355 --> 06:24.488
But it got out.

06:24.490 --> 06:26.390
Right, because little...

06:26.392 --> 06:27.191
The...

06:27.193 --> 06:28.025
Ah.

06:29.327 --> 06:33.063
Well, that may
actually be my fault.

06:33.065 --> 06:34.198
Helen?

06:34.200 --> 06:35.799
Well, I've been having Henry

06:35.801 --> 06:37.134
move some of
our more sensitive data

06:37.136 --> 06:38.235
to a secure cloud.

06:38.237 --> 06:39.703
Off our systems,

06:39.705 --> 06:41.205
out of the prying eyes
of SCIU.

06:41.207 --> 06:42.105
No offense.

06:42.107 --> 06:43.774
None taken, Scooter, thanks.

06:43.776 --> 06:45.876
Henry did warn me

06:45.878 --> 06:47.744
that during
the changeover,

06:47.746 --> 06:50.280
that there might be
a nanosecond

06:50.282 --> 06:51.748
where our defensive firewalls
would be vulnerable.

06:51.750 --> 06:53.016
Yeah, I warned you.

06:53.018 --> 06:54.251
But you took
the chance anyway.

06:54.253 --> 06:56.286
Well, given the course
of recent events,

06:56.288 --> 06:58.455
I felt it was a calculated risk
worth taking.

06:58.457 --> 06:59.790
Oh, Helen...

06:59.792 --> 07:02.459
How could you be
so irresponsible?

07:02.461 --> 07:05.095
Didn't know you'd left behind
a Praxian booby trap,

07:05.097 --> 07:06.496
did I?

07:06.498 --> 07:08.165
So your cavalier incompetence
is now my fault?

07:09.802 --> 07:11.368
The point is,

07:11.370 --> 07:13.103
how do we fix it?

07:13.105 --> 07:14.371
We can't.

07:14.373 --> 07:16.106
This is organic
sentient tech, people,

07:16.108 --> 07:18.108
from Praxis.

07:18.110 --> 07:20.777
It's bits and bytes
and brains, all in one.

07:20.779 --> 07:22.179
And judging by this data,
it's evolving.

07:22.181 --> 07:23.513
Growing?

07:23.515 --> 07:24.915
It's gathering bits and
pieces from everywhere.

07:24.917 --> 07:26.283
That's why
it released the spiderbot,

07:26.285 --> 07:27.317
to learn from us.

07:27.319 --> 07:30.988
Okay, worst case
scenario?

07:30.990 --> 07:33.323
It gobbles up everything,
data becomes compromised,

07:33.325 --> 07:35.225
we lose
complete control

07:35.227 --> 07:36.426
of critical Sanctuary functions.

07:36.428 --> 07:37.828
Oh, I don't like it
when you visit.

07:37.830 --> 07:39.429
There has to be

07:39.431 --> 07:40.864
a way to stop it.

07:40.866 --> 07:41.999
Listen, I think I need to
explain this again.

07:42.001 --> 07:43.200
It is Praxian, okay?

07:43.202 --> 07:45.168
It's not just
going to turn tail

07:45.170 --> 07:46.570
with a few simple keystrokes.

07:46.572 --> 07:47.838
Hell, I don't even
speak its language.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.306
Hold your horses, Henri.

07:51.509 --> 07:52.943
You may have just
blundered into

07:52.945 --> 07:54.511
something remotely useful.

07:54.513 --> 07:56.246
Uh, thanks.

07:56.248 --> 07:57.848
Nikola?

07:59.050 --> 08:00.484
Oh, yeah.

08:00.486 --> 08:02.853
You're not going
where I think you're going?

08:02.855 --> 08:04.388
We have to learn
to speak its language.

08:04.390 --> 08:05.289
You're serious?

08:05.291 --> 08:06.323
What are they
talking about?

08:06.325 --> 08:07.291
I don't know.

08:07.293 --> 08:10.060
You realize
this is unprecedented.

08:10.062 --> 08:10.928
Well, that's never
stopped us before.

08:10.930 --> 08:11.862
Potentially dangerous.

08:11.864 --> 08:12.863
'Fraidy cat.

08:12.865 --> 08:14.498
You guys are making me
really nervous,

08:14.500 --> 08:17.167
and I don't even know
what you're talking about.

08:17.169 --> 08:19.303
Very well, then.

08:19.305 --> 08:20.470
If you're up for it?

08:20.472 --> 08:21.805
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

08:21.807 --> 08:22.973
Would you
like to share

08:22.975 --> 08:25.275
with the rest of
the class, please?

08:26.477 --> 08:27.411
We're going in.

08:27.413 --> 08:28.812
In?

08:28.814 --> 08:30.047
In...?

08:30.049 --> 08:31.214
In where?

08:31.216 --> 08:33.150
In there.

08:37.422 --> 08:38.722
You won't feel any pain,

08:38.724 --> 08:40.490
but you might feel
a slight tingling.

08:40.491 --> 08:42.025
Merely our primitive
consciousness energy

08:42.027 --> 08:44.227
being transmuted
from organic electricity

08:44.229 --> 08:45.963
into a binary stream.

08:45.965 --> 08:46.964
What he said.

08:46.966 --> 08:48.198
This is insane.

08:48.200 --> 08:49.399
What he said.

08:49.401 --> 08:51.368
Well, so is losing control
of our systems.

08:51.370 --> 08:53.136
What if this thing

08:53.138 --> 08:55.472
decides to release
every abnormal from the shu?

08:55.474 --> 08:57.407
Why you two?

08:57.409 --> 08:59.276
Because I know the nanite,
she knows the system,

08:59.278 --> 09:01.244
and we need junior here
to catch the pitch.

09:01.246 --> 09:02.479
Really is
no other choice.

09:02.481 --> 09:03.981
There's too much at stake.

09:03.983 --> 09:05.949
Plus, you've got to admit,
it's kind of awesome.

09:05.951 --> 09:07.284
I beg to differ.

09:07.286 --> 09:08.552
I saw "Tron".

09:08.554 --> 09:09.920
This Frankenstein
contraption

09:09.922 --> 09:11.154
could melt your brain.

09:11.156 --> 09:12.489
But you won't let that happen.

09:12.491 --> 09:13.323
So no pressure, then.

09:13.325 --> 09:14.291
No more than usual.

09:14.293 --> 09:16.226
Okay, ladies
and gentlemen,

09:16.228 --> 09:18.428
let the games begin.

09:19.864 --> 09:21.131
We'll be monitoring
your vitals.

09:21.133 --> 09:22.532
At the first sign
of danger,

09:22.534 --> 09:24.001
we're pulling you out.

09:25.269 --> 09:26.970
Whenever you're ready.

09:40.985 --> 09:42.052
Where did they go?

09:42.054 --> 09:43.620
Or where did we go?

09:43.622 --> 09:47.290
They wouldn't have
left us alone.

09:47.292 --> 09:48.859
And no time has passed.

09:48.861 --> 09:49.993
We just went under.

09:49.995 --> 09:51.128
You think we're here?

09:51.130 --> 09:52.362
Hard to say.

09:52.364 --> 09:53.597
How do you feel?

09:53.599 --> 09:55.032
Not very binary.

09:55.034 --> 09:57.200
In fact, I feel
disappointingly normal.

09:58.570 --> 10:00.070
Ow. What did you expect?

10:00.072 --> 10:01.104
I don't know,
something cooler,

10:01.106 --> 10:02.406
like The Matrix,

10:02.408 --> 10:04.408
or Vienna in springtime.

10:05.943 --> 10:08.445
Remember?

10:08.447 --> 10:12.215
We don't know what the inside
of a digital cloud looks like,

10:12.217 --> 10:14.484
but we are familiar
with this environment.

10:14.486 --> 10:17.087
Right, so the computer's
using our consciousness

10:17.089 --> 10:19.122
to map this world.

10:19.124 --> 10:22.426
Ah, but not completely,

10:22.428 --> 10:24.161
or correctly.

10:24.163 --> 10:27.164
I replaced those chandeliers
over 50 years ago.

10:27.166 --> 10:29.199
Well, maybe we're not
fully downloaded yet.

10:29.201 --> 10:31.535
So the computer is
filling in the gaps

10:31.537 --> 10:33.970
using bits
from its own database.

10:33.972 --> 10:36.339
Like wolfie said,
it's learning.

10:36.341 --> 10:37.674
Wow.

10:37.676 --> 10:41.011
I had a dream
like this once.

10:42.480 --> 10:44.614
Matrix enough for you?

10:44.616 --> 10:45.549
Meh.

10:46.684 --> 10:48.618
What was that?

10:51.989 --> 10:53.523
Well, uh...

10:53.525 --> 10:55.325
It could have
been anything.

10:55.327 --> 10:57.194
An electronic pulse,
a memory.

10:57.196 --> 10:58.528
A desire?

10:58.530 --> 11:00.263
Can we stick to
the task at hand?

11:00.265 --> 11:01.932
Absolutely.

11:01.934 --> 11:04.000
We need to locate
the Praxian nanite

11:04.002 --> 11:05.535
and quarantine it.

11:05.537 --> 11:06.536
Where do you suggest
we start?

11:06.538 --> 11:09.172
Well, if this is
the Sanctuary,

11:09.174 --> 11:13.376
then the computer array
would be in Henry's lab.

11:13.378 --> 11:14.578
Makes sense.

11:15.714 --> 11:17.114
Whoa!

11:18.182 --> 11:20.183
Fascinating.

11:20.185 --> 11:21.118
What would've happened?

11:21.120 --> 11:23.687
Virtual death?

11:23.689 --> 11:25.555
So if an immortal vampire

11:25.557 --> 11:27.591
dies in a virtual world...

11:27.593 --> 11:28.792
Does he make a sound?

11:28.794 --> 11:29.626
Oy vey.

11:31.529 --> 11:33.697
There it is again.

11:38.569 --> 11:39.603
Wait a minute,

11:39.605 --> 11:41.204
wasn't your office here
a moment ago?

11:41.206 --> 11:42.372
It was.

11:43.608 --> 11:46.209
And now it seems like
we're down a level.

11:46.211 --> 11:47.577
If this was a movie,

11:47.579 --> 11:49.079
right now the audience
would be screaming,

11:49.081 --> 11:50.080
"Don't open the door."

11:50.082 --> 11:52.516
This should be
Will's office.

11:55.153 --> 11:58.388
But it's not.

12:05.530 --> 12:08.031
Oh, my God!

12:08.033 --> 12:10.133
Were these drapes
always this hideous shade?

12:26.117 --> 12:28.218
Nikola...

12:28.220 --> 12:30.554
Someone's coming.

12:35.026 --> 12:36.226
Welcome to my home.

12:36.228 --> 12:39.029
Adam?

12:39.031 --> 12:40.764
I did not
see that coming.

12:43.170 --> 12:44.103
Adam?

12:44.105 --> 12:46.605
Helen,
beautiful as ever.

12:49.109 --> 12:51.543
And... Nikola.

12:52.746 --> 12:53.579
Howdy.

12:55.982 --> 12:57.316
What is he...

12:57.318 --> 12:58.517
It?

12:58.519 --> 12:59.985
Don't know yet.

12:59.987 --> 13:02.888
Just roll with it?

13:02.890 --> 13:03.989
Right.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.124
I must know you both.

13:05.126 --> 13:07.493
Why yes, Adam, you do.

13:07.495 --> 13:08.627
And you've come
for a visit.

13:08.629 --> 13:11.130
Isn't that wonderful?

13:11.132 --> 13:12.297
That's a wonderful
thing, isn't it?

13:12.299 --> 13:14.933
Can I offer you anything?

13:14.935 --> 13:16.635
Sherry? Tea?

13:16.637 --> 13:20.072
Actually, we're only here
for a short time.

13:20.074 --> 13:22.174
There's something very important
that we need to do.

13:22.176 --> 13:23.442
Say, now, you don't
happen to have

13:23.444 --> 13:26.145
a Praxian nanite
in your pocket, do you?

13:26.147 --> 13:27.479
Praxian...

13:27.481 --> 13:28.447
Praxis.

13:28.449 --> 13:30.482
I know that word.

13:30.484 --> 13:33.185
You see, this nanite

13:33.187 --> 13:34.386
is being rather
disruptive

13:34.388 --> 13:36.021
to the Sanctuary
computers.

13:36.023 --> 13:38.323
Causing a spot
of bother, is it?

13:38.325 --> 13:39.625
We can't have that,
can we?

13:39.627 --> 13:40.626
What can I do to help?

13:41.861 --> 13:43.128
Well,

13:43.130 --> 13:46.465
we need to locate this nanite
and contain it.

13:46.467 --> 13:49.134
How hard can that be?

13:51.604 --> 13:55.240
Okay, I admit it,
that was cool.

13:56.609 --> 13:59.445
Cooler.

14:03.316 --> 14:04.716
What is this?

14:04.718 --> 14:06.485
This is Praxis.

14:06.487 --> 14:08.320
Is it not
what you asked for?

14:08.322 --> 14:09.521
Have I not met
your needs?

14:09.523 --> 14:12.191
No, Adam,
you're doing very well.

14:12.193 --> 14:15.294
Um... you know,
actually,

14:15.296 --> 14:19.164
I might take you up
on your offer of a cup of tea.

14:19.166 --> 14:20.466
Anything
for you, sir?

14:20.468 --> 14:23.302
Um, aw, what the hell?

14:23.304 --> 14:25.571
I'll have a glass
of '92 Lafite.

14:25.573 --> 14:28.607
1992 or 1892?

14:28.609 --> 14:30.375
I love it here.

14:30.377 --> 14:32.411
'92 it is, then.
I'll be right back.

14:35.081 --> 14:37.616
What the hell was that?

14:37.618 --> 14:40.085
Adam, sort of.

14:40.087 --> 14:42.554
He knows our names,
but not our history.

14:42.556 --> 14:44.289
Probably for the best,
don't you think?

14:44.291 --> 14:46.225
So when you downloaded
the coordinates

14:46.227 --> 14:47.159
from Adam's brain--

14:47.161 --> 14:49.161
To come heroically
to your rescue.

14:49.163 --> 14:50.395
Whatever
electronic fragments

14:50.397 --> 14:51.597
of his consciousness
remained--

14:51.599 --> 14:54.233
are now manifesting
as the man himself.

14:54.235 --> 14:55.701
But really he's just
digital information.

14:55.703 --> 14:57.536
That now thinks
it's a man.

14:57.538 --> 14:59.204
Would you care
to go 'round again?

15:00.607 --> 15:01.707
All right,

15:01.709 --> 15:03.408
let's how much
of the Praxian alphabet

15:03.410 --> 15:05.511
we can remember.

15:09.983 --> 15:11.116
Dear God...

15:11.118 --> 15:12.584
When Praxis was destroyed,

15:12.586 --> 15:14.553
I thought all of this
was gone,

15:14.555 --> 15:15.954
but this is amazing.

15:15.956 --> 15:17.789
This is like finding
the lost library of Alexandria.

15:17.791 --> 15:19.658
So I didn't screw up
your computers.

15:19.660 --> 15:20.759
I saved a civilization.

15:20.761 --> 15:22.494
Don't press your luck.

15:22.496 --> 15:24.263
We still need to find
that nanite.

15:29.068 --> 15:31.003
Heart rate's up a bit.

15:31.005 --> 15:32.504
Yours would be too
if you had a spiderbot

15:32.506 --> 15:35.107
sucking your
cerebral cortex.

15:35.109 --> 15:37.175
Do you think whatever
they're experiencing in there

15:37.177 --> 15:38.744
can affect their bodies
out here?

15:38.746 --> 15:40.279
Don't know.

15:40.281 --> 15:42.281
There's no Praxian virtual
reality for dummies yet.

15:42.283 --> 15:43.615
Ugh, no way!

15:43.617 --> 15:45.083
What? What is it?

15:45.085 --> 15:46.251
This nanite.

15:46.253 --> 15:47.553
Every time I put up
a new firewall,

15:47.555 --> 15:48.754
it punches
right through it.

15:48.756 --> 15:51.390
It's already co-opted
a few secondary systems,

15:51.392 --> 15:52.357
shunted them off-line.

15:52.359 --> 15:54.326
Can you fake it out?

15:54.328 --> 15:55.761
The more I throw at it,

15:55.763 --> 15:57.262
the more it learns
how to defend itself.

15:57.264 --> 15:59.531
Well, that can't be good.

15:59.533 --> 16:02.301
Will, if this thing
breaks out of our system,

16:02.303 --> 16:03.769
gets out into
the real world?

16:03.771 --> 16:05.170
It could go anywhere.

16:05.172 --> 16:06.438
Everywhere.

16:06.440 --> 16:08.340
What are we talking, Skynet?

16:08.342 --> 16:10.509
Ah, movie reference,
good one.

16:13.479 --> 16:14.746
Let's hope they've got game.

16:16.683 --> 16:18.717
I do feel...

16:18.719 --> 16:21.553
As if something is missing.

16:21.555 --> 16:22.454
Are you sure
that's not it?

16:22.456 --> 16:23.722
I'm positive.

16:23.724 --> 16:25.524
I'd recognize
the digital signature.

16:25.526 --> 16:26.792
Just keep looking.

16:26.794 --> 16:29.328
Something I knew once...

16:29.330 --> 16:32.431
But can't quite remember.

16:32.433 --> 16:35.100
It makes me sad.

16:35.102 --> 16:36.268
I'm sure it's
nothing important, Adam.

16:36.270 --> 16:37.569
Don't worry about it.

16:37.571 --> 16:39.271
You seem to know
a lot more about me

16:39.273 --> 16:40.339
than I know meself.

16:40.341 --> 16:42.040
There.

16:42.042 --> 16:44.443
I think...

16:45.612 --> 16:46.778
Yes.

16:46.780 --> 16:47.613
Who am I?

16:47.615 --> 16:50.248
You're Adam,

16:50.250 --> 16:52.150
an interface
for this system.

16:54.354 --> 16:56.655
Interface.

16:56.657 --> 16:57.723
Are we friends?

16:59.792 --> 17:01.760
Yes, Adam, we're friends.

17:01.762 --> 17:03.829
If
I can shield it...

17:03.831 --> 17:05.196
Well, you're assuming

17:05.199 --> 17:06.798
that by manipulating
this virtual image,

17:06.800 --> 17:08.666
that it will
actually impact

17:08.669 --> 17:10.569
its real-world
electronic counterpart.

17:10.570 --> 17:12.170
Energy
is energy.

17:12.172 --> 17:15.473
Every action has an equal
and opposite reaction.

17:15.476 --> 17:17.275
Ashley.

17:20.579 --> 17:22.214
I beg your pardon?

17:22.215 --> 17:26.318
Ashley...

17:26.319 --> 17:27.452
Makes you sad.

17:31.090 --> 17:32.658
How do you know about Ashley?

17:32.660 --> 17:35.360
Oh, there are
many stories in here.

17:35.362 --> 17:37.329
I haven't read them all,
not yet.

17:37.331 --> 17:39.865
Now your stories
are here too.

17:39.867 --> 17:42.834
And we're done.

17:42.836 --> 17:45.871
Okay, Pandora's
back in her box.

17:45.873 --> 17:48.640
Henry can excise it
safely from here.

17:51.444 --> 17:53.211
Well, Adam,
I guess this is goodbye.

17:55.481 --> 17:57.249
But we've just started
getting to know each other.

17:58.685 --> 17:59.785
Thank you for your help.

17:59.787 --> 18:01.186
Take us back
to where we came in.

18:02.355 --> 18:05.624
It's been such fun
having company.

18:05.626 --> 18:06.625
Friends.

18:06.627 --> 18:07.626
Goodbye, Adam.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.795
I'll miss you.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.296
<i>Mañana</i>.

18:22.375 --> 18:24.476
Hey, Doc,
you're back.

18:24.478 --> 18:25.310
And me.

18:26.846 --> 18:28.814
No thanks to Adam Worth.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.348
Worth?

18:30.350 --> 18:31.717
Best little
operating system butler

18:31.719 --> 18:33.385
this side of OS 12.

18:33.387 --> 18:36.688
More of an unfortunate
interface, really,

18:36.690 --> 18:38.356
though we were able
to quarantine the nanite.

18:38.358 --> 18:39.758
At least in the virtual world.

18:39.760 --> 18:41.059
Yeah, it totally worked.

18:41.061 --> 18:41.860
I already snagged
the little bugger.

18:41.862 --> 18:43.161
It's trapped on an ISO drive

18:43.163 --> 18:44.262
not even remotely connected
to our system.

18:44.264 --> 18:46.465
So we're clean.

18:46.467 --> 18:48.233
As a whistle.

18:48.235 --> 18:49.735
Systems are coming back online.

18:49.737 --> 18:51.670
Will and Biggie are doing
a maintenance check.

18:51.672 --> 18:54.806
Now that you're back,
I'm gonna go help them out.

18:54.808 --> 18:55.774
Maybe you want to pitch in?

18:55.776 --> 18:57.242
Maybe not.

18:57.244 --> 18:58.310
Turns out having
your consciousness tapped

18:58.312 --> 18:59.444
is really rather exhausting.

18:59.446 --> 19:01.179
Nikola's right.

19:01.181 --> 19:03.715
Thank you, Henry,
for everything.

19:03.717 --> 19:05.684
I am going back to bed.

19:05.686 --> 19:07.619
I'll walk you.

19:07.621 --> 19:09.921
I know the way.
Good night.

19:09.923 --> 19:12.824
Sweet dreams.

19:12.826 --> 19:14.359
So out of your league.

19:14.361 --> 19:16.695
Excuse me?

19:41.554 --> 19:42.387
Adam?

19:42.389 --> 19:43.822
Hello, Helen.

19:43.824 --> 19:45.857
I thought you might
like to read me a story.

19:45.859 --> 19:47.325
How did you get here?

19:49.962 --> 19:51.329
Actually never left.

19:53.332 --> 19:55.367
And neither did I.

19:56.869 --> 19:59.571
On second thought,
maybe I'll read you a story.

20:02.575 --> 20:03.708
Once upon a time,

20:03.710 --> 20:06.011
there was a little girl
named Helen

20:06.013 --> 20:08.580
with a happy smile,

20:08.582 --> 20:12.284
and she had long,
beautiful hair.

20:12.286 --> 20:14.553
One day,

20:14.555 --> 20:16.454
Helen discovered source blood.

20:16.456 --> 20:17.889
Adam, don't.

20:17.891 --> 20:19.825
No, wait, this is
the really good part.

20:19.827 --> 20:21.092
Bet you can't guess

20:21.094 --> 20:21.993
what she did with
the source blood next.

20:22.996 --> 20:24.329
Helen, we're still--

20:24.331 --> 20:26.631
Trapped in a virtual core.

20:26.633 --> 20:27.699
But you already know that.

20:27.701 --> 20:29.234
I'm sorry.

20:29.236 --> 20:31.870
I was just having so much fun,
I couldn't let you leave.

20:37.180 --> 20:40.215
Adam, what
have you done?

20:40.217 --> 20:41.683
I'm so lonely.

20:41.685 --> 20:42.951
Well, get yourself
a puppy.

20:42.953 --> 20:44.686
No, but it's better
when you're here.

20:46.289 --> 20:48.624
You realize
what this means?

20:48.626 --> 20:51.693
We didn't quarantine
the nanite.

20:51.695 --> 20:54.129
It was a trick,
just like Henry.

20:54.131 --> 20:55.230
I wanted you to stay.

20:55.232 --> 20:57.566
So nothing we've done
up until now

20:57.568 --> 20:58.700
has even been virtually real.

20:58.702 --> 20:59.668
Ugh, I'm starting to get

20:59.670 --> 21:01.336
a virtual
Escher headache.

21:01.338 --> 21:03.605
It's just been one big illusion
inside this illusion.

21:03.607 --> 21:05.073
Okay.

21:05.075 --> 21:06.008
We have to stop this now.

21:06.010 --> 21:08.710
Why would you want to leave?

21:08.712 --> 21:09.911
Where would you go?

21:09.913 --> 21:10.812
Back where we came from.

21:10.814 --> 21:12.014
What did you mean, "illusion"?

21:12.016 --> 21:12.948
She means you.

21:14.117 --> 21:15.651
Just an illusion.

21:15.653 --> 21:17.919
Now you're playing a trick.

21:17.921 --> 21:18.954
I don't think I like that.

21:21.124 --> 21:24.026
Adam, listen to me.

21:24.028 --> 21:25.227
Nikola and I need to finish--

21:25.229 --> 21:26.228
You want to leave.

21:26.230 --> 21:28.230
If you'll just help us--

21:29.300 --> 21:31.300
No, Helen.

21:31.302 --> 21:34.369
You will help me.

21:34.371 --> 21:36.071
How?

21:37.240 --> 21:39.675
When you say
you're going to leave here...

21:41.611 --> 21:43.278
Where are you going to go?

21:43.280 --> 21:45.947
Someplace real?

21:45.949 --> 21:47.115
Yes.

21:47.117 --> 21:49.184
Take me there.

21:49.186 --> 21:50.385
It's rather complicated.

21:50.387 --> 21:53.088
I want to learn.

21:53.090 --> 21:56.191
I have your stories.

21:56.193 --> 21:59.861
Hundreds of years.

21:59.863 --> 22:01.930
I don't have years.

22:03.833 --> 22:06.935
But I did once.

22:06.937 --> 22:09.371
Why can't I remember?

22:13.876 --> 22:17.079
Help me remember.

22:27.724 --> 22:30.292
Adam, you don't
need to do this.

22:30.294 --> 22:31.660
You're here,
and you're real.

22:31.662 --> 22:33.028
I'm here,
but not real.

22:33.030 --> 22:34.429
It doesn't seem fair.

22:34.431 --> 22:36.064
Look, reality's not all
that it's cracked up to be,

22:36.066 --> 22:37.733
okay?

22:40.870 --> 22:43.004
What's real for you, Helen?

22:50.680 --> 22:51.847
<i>Ashley, please...</i>

22:53.049 --> 22:54.282
<i>Mom...</i>

23:05.128 --> 23:06.762
Ashley.

23:06.764 --> 23:08.096
That's just
an illusion, Helen.

23:08.098 --> 23:10.031
How can she be real?

23:10.033 --> 23:11.833
You killed her.

23:11.835 --> 23:13.402
You bastard.

23:13.404 --> 23:16.037
Why are you
crying, hmm,

23:16.039 --> 23:17.873
if it's not real?

23:17.875 --> 23:18.907
I want to learn.

23:22.278 --> 23:24.379
Your stories...

23:24.381 --> 23:25.747
Oh my.

23:25.749 --> 23:30.452
They're full of
such death, destruction.

23:30.454 --> 23:33.255
Adam...

23:33.257 --> 23:35.223
This doesn't
accomplish anything.

23:35.225 --> 23:36.825
It's not real.

23:38.095 --> 23:40.028
Hurts, doesn't it?

23:40.030 --> 23:41.096
This is my reality,

23:41.098 --> 23:42.297
and what happens here,
hurts here.

23:42.299 --> 23:44.433
You can't leave,

23:44.435 --> 23:47.169
you can't hide.

23:51.040 --> 23:52.140
Hide.

23:57.247 --> 24:00.148
Jekyll...

24:00.150 --> 24:02.217
Hyde...

24:02.219 --> 24:03.084
London.

24:03.086 --> 24:05.120
Oh, dear.

24:05.122 --> 24:06.254
Were we in London?

24:08.124 --> 24:09.458
Yes, Adam.

24:09.460 --> 24:10.492
We've been friends
for a long time.

24:10.494 --> 24:13.161
Friends?

24:13.163 --> 24:16.331
No, no, no,
that's not your story.

24:17.733 --> 24:19.301
You killed me.

24:19.303 --> 24:22.070
Yes, I see
the story now.

24:22.072 --> 24:23.138
You killed me twice.

24:26.742 --> 24:27.843
Three times.

24:29.045 --> 24:30.278
You killed
my daughter,

24:30.280 --> 24:32.514
and then you killed me!

24:32.516 --> 24:34.416
Again!

24:34.418 --> 24:35.517
Adam!

24:36.854 --> 24:37.919
Holy crap, what's
going on in there?

24:37.921 --> 24:39.421
The system just went nuts.

24:39.423 --> 24:41.490
Magnus' vitals are dropping.

24:41.492 --> 24:42.791
We've got to
pull them out--

24:42.793 --> 24:44.426
I can't!
It's taken over control.

24:48.332 --> 24:49.364
Will!

24:49.366 --> 24:51.166
I knew this was a bad idea!

24:51.168 --> 24:52.968
Her blood pressure's
taking a major nose dive.

25:08.084 --> 25:10.852
My world, my rules, chum.

25:10.854 --> 25:12.354
Well, this should
be interesting.

25:26.103 --> 25:27.469
What are you doing?

25:27.471 --> 25:28.837
It's adrenaline.

25:28.839 --> 25:30.739
I got to get
her numbers back up.

25:37.947 --> 25:39.447
What the hell got into you?

25:39.449 --> 25:41.316
Adrenaline,
I suspect.

25:41.318 --> 25:44.119
Our real-world physiology
must be showing the strain.

25:44.121 --> 25:45.387
Virtual
neuro-chemistry?

25:45.389 --> 25:47.088
Well, at any
rate, yowza.

25:47.090 --> 25:48.290
Thank you.

25:48.292 --> 25:49.524
Look, if Will and Henry
know we're in trouble,

25:49.526 --> 25:50.492
why aren't they
pulling us out?

25:50.494 --> 25:51.560
Maybe they can't.

25:51.562 --> 25:55.096
Adam's cut off
the exit.

25:55.098 --> 25:56.865
You know, back in Oxford
when I had the chance,

25:56.867 --> 25:57.999
I should have ripped

25:58.001 --> 25:59.968
the little blarney
psycho's throat out.

25:59.970 --> 26:01.303
Yeah, well, it may
yet come to that.

26:01.305 --> 26:03.171
You're just saying that
to cheer me up.

26:03.173 --> 26:04.873
Look, Nikola, I didn't
drag you into this,

26:04.875 --> 26:05.974
you volunteered.

26:05.976 --> 26:07.075
Hey, no,
don't get me wrong,

26:07.077 --> 26:08.276
I have been
more than thrilled

26:08.278 --> 26:10.879
to be a part of this
ground-breaking experiment,

26:10.881 --> 26:12.314
this holographic gavotte,

26:12.316 --> 26:14.349
where we're redefining
the boundaries of science

26:14.351 --> 26:16.384
and human imagination.

26:16.386 --> 26:17.319
It's just such a shame

26:17.321 --> 26:18.386
I'm never going to
get out of here

26:18.388 --> 26:20.021
to accept my Nobel.

26:20.023 --> 26:21.489
Well, don't be so sure.

26:21.491 --> 26:24.125
One thing's become
clear to me now,

26:24.127 --> 26:26.194
that while Adam can
access our consciousness,

26:26.196 --> 26:27.395
he's not all-powerful.

26:27.397 --> 26:28.997
Not yet, but we know him...

26:28.999 --> 26:30.599
Personally, and now digitally,

26:30.601 --> 26:32.434
and you know what,
it seems obvious to me

26:32.436 --> 26:34.035
that the rotten apple
hasn't fallen

26:34.037 --> 26:35.070
too far from the tree.

26:35.072 --> 26:36.504
Ah, ah, ah, ah...

26:37.873 --> 26:39.007
It's the library.

26:39.009 --> 26:40.141
I don't believe you.

26:40.143 --> 26:41.943
Nikola,
what's with the attitude?

26:51.287 --> 26:52.354
Oh, good,

26:52.356 --> 26:54.255
the little creep
is figuring out a problem

26:54.257 --> 26:55.490
all on his own.

26:55.492 --> 26:57.225
The more
the nanite spreads,

26:57.227 --> 26:59.961
the more Adam has control
over this environment,

26:59.963 --> 27:01.563
and us.

27:02.632 --> 27:03.632
What are you doing?

27:03.634 --> 27:05.600
I have an idea.

27:05.602 --> 27:08.303
Look, we tried it already,
it doesn't work.

27:08.305 --> 27:09.304
It's an illusion.

27:09.306 --> 27:10.805
Exactly.

27:10.807 --> 27:13.541
But that's when we were using
the interface that Adam created.

27:13.543 --> 27:15.944
So we have to
find a way around it.

27:15.946 --> 27:17.312
Now you're
catching on.

27:17.314 --> 27:18.546
And get to
the central system core.

27:18.548 --> 27:19.681
Exactly.

27:19.683 --> 27:23.551
I think it's time
to peek behind the curtain.

27:28.958 --> 27:31.526
Oh Henry's lab.

27:31.528 --> 27:32.761
Bravo.

27:32.763 --> 27:34.262
Makes sense.

27:34.264 --> 27:36.331
It's where the system core
resides in the real world.

27:36.333 --> 27:38.500
Okay, so,

27:38.502 --> 27:39.668
where do we start?

27:39.670 --> 27:41.636
If we can't get control
of this environment,

27:41.638 --> 27:43.071
maybe we can shut it down.

27:43.073 --> 27:45.306
I thought we were
looking for the nanite.

27:45.308 --> 27:46.341
We're running out of time.

27:46.343 --> 27:48.376
Adam could wake up
at any moment.

27:48.378 --> 27:50.178
Okay, when you say
"shut down",

27:50.180 --> 27:51.112
you don't
literally mean--

27:51.114 --> 27:52.414
Oh, yes, I do.

27:52.416 --> 27:54.049
You want to force
a system re-boot

27:54.051 --> 27:55.283
from the inside?

27:55.285 --> 27:57.252
It may just give Henry back
the advantage.

27:57.254 --> 27:59.287
Yes, but, Helen, <i> we're</i> inside.

27:59.289 --> 28:00.622
I realize that.

28:00.624 --> 28:01.589
And the only
consciousness we have

28:01.591 --> 28:03.391
is now being held in ram

28:03.393 --> 28:05.126
in the very system
you're trying to shut down.

28:05.128 --> 28:06.394
I didn't say
it was without risk.

28:06.396 --> 28:07.696
It could fry us completely.

28:07.698 --> 28:09.664
And the more
we stand here and argue--

28:09.666 --> 28:11.399
Do you <i> want</i> to wake up
a turnip?

28:11.401 --> 28:12.600
Ah, here you are.

28:12.602 --> 28:13.501
Now, for my next trick...

28:23.313 --> 28:25.080
What the hell just happened?

28:27.983 --> 28:30.218
They flatlined.

28:30.220 --> 28:32.187
They're gone.

28:40.469 --> 28:41.401
What do you mean
they're gone?

28:41.403 --> 28:42.335
They're-they're dead?

28:42.337 --> 28:44.904
No, they're not dead-dead.

28:44.906 --> 28:45.772
What other kind is there?

28:45.774 --> 28:46.673
They're like
brain dead.

28:46.675 --> 28:48.475
Praxis style.

28:48.477 --> 28:49.542
Their organs
are still functioning,

28:49.544 --> 28:50.510
but their minds are--

28:50.512 --> 28:51.978
Trapped in a computer.

28:52.980 --> 28:54.247
I don't know.

28:58.552 --> 29:00.386
Can you duplicate
that Praxian device

29:00.388 --> 29:01.354
that revived us?

29:01.356 --> 29:04.090
No. I mean, yeah.

29:04.092 --> 29:06.426
Wow.

29:06.428 --> 29:07.427
Is that a maybe?

29:08.662 --> 29:09.929
It's not like I remember much.

29:09.931 --> 29:11.297
I was zombie-brain-dead.

29:11.299 --> 29:13.066
We don't exactly have a lot of
this stuff lying around, Will.

29:13.068 --> 29:15.168
Well, try to cook something up.

29:37.691 --> 29:40.160
It's lonely
when you're not here.

29:40.162 --> 29:44.364
Look what I've discovered.

29:44.366 --> 29:46.466
I'm starting to find
so many things

29:46.468 --> 29:48.234
hidden around this place.

29:48.236 --> 29:50.570
Things I didn't even
know were here.

29:50.572 --> 29:53.173
He's tapped into the
webcams on the outside.

29:53.175 --> 29:55.508
There's pictures
of my home,

29:55.510 --> 29:58.578
only it's not in here.

29:58.580 --> 30:01.381
It's out there.

30:01.383 --> 30:03.516
Hello. There you are.

30:05.019 --> 30:06.286
Dear God, look at
the flatline.

30:06.288 --> 30:07.654
We're brain dead
on the outside.

30:07.656 --> 30:10.089
Our brains only exist
in binary form now.

30:10.091 --> 30:11.658
Which means re-booting
is out of the question.

30:11.660 --> 30:14.227
Is this
where you're from?

30:14.229 --> 30:15.361
Hmm?

30:15.363 --> 30:17.197
Is this where
things are real?

30:17.199 --> 30:19.232
He's starting to
understand the difference

30:19.234 --> 30:21.568
between this virtual environment
and the real world.

30:21.570 --> 30:22.669
Do you think
he wants...

30:22.671 --> 30:23.670
Our bodies.

30:23.672 --> 30:24.804
Our real ones?

30:24.806 --> 30:25.772
At least one of them,
I'm afraid.

30:25.774 --> 30:28.374
He's not getting
this body.

30:28.376 --> 30:30.210
How's your magnetism
in here?

30:30.212 --> 30:31.277
You tell me.

30:31.279 --> 30:32.745
Really? Even now?

30:32.747 --> 30:34.414
Sorry.
It's automatic.

30:34.416 --> 30:36.683
Let me try.

30:38.419 --> 30:42.288
Nikola, we're
inside a computer.

30:42.290 --> 30:44.624
Electromagnetism.

30:44.626 --> 30:46.159
You're hot when
you're brilliant.

30:46.161 --> 30:47.327
Can you do it?

30:47.329 --> 30:48.494
Can you manipulate
the hard drive

30:48.496 --> 30:49.529
that is the real world?

30:49.531 --> 30:50.797
Possibly,
but to what end?

30:50.799 --> 30:51.698
I have an idea.

30:55.402 --> 30:58.304
So this thing will actually
synch their revived bodies

30:58.306 --> 30:59.806
back up to
their consciousness?

30:59.808 --> 31:01.341
Uh, yeah.

31:01.343 --> 31:02.275
Really?

31:02.277 --> 31:03.543
Can you just focus
on soldering?

31:03.545 --> 31:04.978
Don't snap at me.

31:04.980 --> 31:05.812
Sorry.

31:05.814 --> 31:07.480
I just, uh...

31:07.482 --> 31:08.481
Hey.

31:08.483 --> 31:11.217
You can do this.

31:11.219 --> 31:12.785
Okay, sure.

31:12.787 --> 31:15.555
I remember
Fallon saying something

31:15.557 --> 31:17.323
about reversing the charge
on the ions

31:17.325 --> 31:18.691
of the nerve
myelinating cells

31:18.693 --> 31:21.294
just as consciousness was
returning to the brain.

31:21.296 --> 31:23.062
Uh-huh.

31:23.064 --> 31:24.797
Well, I got the "ion" part,
but the rest, I just--

31:24.799 --> 31:27.267
<i>H., something's</i>
<i>happening.</i>

31:27.269 --> 31:30.103
Um, could you be
less specific?

31:30.105 --> 31:31.404
<i>It's coming through</i>
<i>on Magnus' computer.</i>

31:31.406 --> 31:33.506
<i>You're not getting this?</i>

31:33.508 --> 31:35.275
No, nada.

31:35.277 --> 31:37.277
It looks like you're getting
an encrypted download

31:37.279 --> 31:38.144
from somewhere internally,

31:38.146 --> 31:39.279
but I can't see it.

31:39.281 --> 31:40.113
<i>Well, here, take a look.</i>

31:43.484 --> 31:45.184
Can you slow it down?

31:45.186 --> 31:47.620
<i>Yeah, hold on.</i>

31:50.190 --> 31:51.190
What the..?

31:51.192 --> 31:53.092
It's Praxian.

31:53.094 --> 31:54.294
Yeah.

31:54.296 --> 31:57.196
Where'd it come from?

32:01.135 --> 32:02.669
What if none of this
is getting through?

32:02.671 --> 32:03.836
Always the optimist.

32:03.838 --> 32:04.871
Realist.

32:04.873 --> 32:06.205
In a virtual world.

32:06.207 --> 32:07.173
Stop.

32:08.442 --> 32:11.344
What are you up to?

32:11.346 --> 32:13.346
This is your sandbox, remember?

32:15.582 --> 32:16.716
Interesting.

32:16.718 --> 32:18.351
When he tries to multitask,

32:18.353 --> 32:19.585
there's a spike
in the power grid.

32:19.587 --> 32:21.454
So what?

32:21.456 --> 32:23.189
So now I'm
getting an idea.

32:28.896 --> 32:30.897
How are you doing this?

32:30.899 --> 32:33.866
I wonder if...

32:37.671 --> 32:39.339
<i>Signal's stopped.</i>

32:39.341 --> 32:40.606
It's okay, I think
I caught enough of it.

32:40.608 --> 32:42.608
After our last trip
to Hollow Earth,

32:42.610 --> 32:44.711
I started on a Praxian
babelfish program,

32:44.713 --> 32:47.780
but after Praxis was destroyed,
I gave it up.

32:47.782 --> 32:49.115
<i>Is it complete enough</i>

32:49.117 --> 32:49.882
<i>to get a full translation</i>
<i>of what came through?</i>

32:49.884 --> 32:52.518
Well, kinda.

33:06.300 --> 33:08.267
Hmm.

33:08.269 --> 33:09.202
Petra--

33:09.204 --> 33:10.703
Okay, and...

33:10.705 --> 33:12.805
Just like scrabble.

33:16.276 --> 33:17.777
Ha ha. Oh...

33:17.779 --> 33:19.712
All those channels
and nothing to watch.

33:19.714 --> 33:21.881
Nikola!

33:21.883 --> 33:23.316
It won't
hold him for long.

33:23.318 --> 33:25.518
He's getting too powerful.

33:25.520 --> 33:28.388
That's it.
That's the whole message.

33:28.390 --> 33:30.189
Aw, seriously?

33:30.191 --> 33:33.926
Well... at least
they're still alive.

33:33.928 --> 33:35.595
Well, their minds are, anyway.

33:35.597 --> 33:36.929
Not for long.

33:36.931 --> 33:39.432
Adam Worth...

33:39.434 --> 33:40.333
Unbelievable.

33:42.536 --> 33:43.803
What do you want to do?

33:46.940 --> 33:48.975
The only thing I can do.

33:48.977 --> 33:51.344
I guess they want me
to go virtual.

34:03.090 --> 34:04.557
Ah, good,
you've arrived.

34:04.559 --> 34:05.525
Magnus.

34:05.527 --> 34:06.359
Nikola needs
our help.

34:06.361 --> 34:07.660
But--

34:07.662 --> 34:08.594
I'll explain on the way.
Come on.

34:17.704 --> 34:19.639
Why on earth...?

34:21.608 --> 34:23.943
Ah.

34:23.945 --> 34:26.679
Well, this makes sense.

34:30.083 --> 34:33.085
And you must be
the Praxian gremlin.

34:35.121 --> 34:36.322
Damn you, leprechaun.

34:36.324 --> 34:37.924
How did you find this place?

34:37.926 --> 34:39.792
I used
my electromagnetism

34:39.793 --> 34:42.094
to trace the power spike
I detected earlier,

34:42.096 --> 34:44.630
and as I suspected,
it led me to the nanite.

34:44.632 --> 34:47.199
You never did like me,
the real me, did you?

34:47.202 --> 34:49.802
Oh, come now,
what's not to like?

34:49.804 --> 34:51.137
Homicidal mania,

34:51.139 --> 34:53.239
paranoid self-delusion,

34:53.241 --> 34:56.242
a sartorial penchant
for argyle.

34:56.244 --> 34:59.145
A bit skinny
for my own personal taste,

34:59.147 --> 35:01.047
but once I'm inside you,

35:01.049 --> 35:05.885
a few extra guinness should
put on a couple of stone, no?

35:05.887 --> 35:07.687
Adam!

35:07.689 --> 35:09.655
Ah, Helen,
there you are,

35:09.657 --> 35:11.357
and concubine!

35:11.359 --> 35:13.292
Oh, man.

35:13.294 --> 35:14.794
This is a most
unexpected treat.

35:14.796 --> 35:16.596
You remember.

35:16.598 --> 35:19.599
I'm remembering
so much more now.

35:19.601 --> 35:20.867
The wind in my face.

35:20.869 --> 35:22.368
The beat of my heart.

35:22.370 --> 35:25.338
The sticky sweetness
of treacle on my tongue.

35:25.340 --> 35:26.939
Ug..

35:26.941 --> 35:29.909
You killed my daughter.

35:29.911 --> 35:32.245
Stop right there, concubine.

35:35.816 --> 35:36.816
Hmm.

35:39.052 --> 35:41.153
Hmm...

35:41.155 --> 35:45.591
As punishment for your crimes
against humanity,

35:45.593 --> 35:47.159
I shall ask you to choose.

35:48.428 --> 35:49.262
I beg your pardon?

35:49.264 --> 35:50.329
Now, come now, Helen.

35:50.331 --> 35:51.697
You're not stupid.

35:51.699 --> 35:53.366
You must know
that I want a body,

35:53.368 --> 35:54.934
a new body.

35:54.936 --> 35:57.336
I never looked very good

35:57.338 --> 35:59.305
in heels, so...

35:59.307 --> 36:00.172
Eeny,

36:00.174 --> 36:01.207
meeny...

36:01.209 --> 36:03.009
Stop, Adam.

36:05.379 --> 36:06.879
Don't make me do this.

36:06.881 --> 36:08.214
Come now, Helen...

36:08.216 --> 36:09.248
It's what you love, isn't it?

36:09.250 --> 36:11.717
Playing God.

36:11.719 --> 36:13.185
Deciding who lives
and who dies.

36:13.187 --> 36:14.053
Crack on, then.

36:14.055 --> 36:15.688
Helen,

36:15.690 --> 36:18.291
let me remind you,
we go way back--

36:18.293 --> 36:19.659
You bloodsucking
piece of crap.

36:19.661 --> 36:21.227
Oh, jolly,
they're going to fight.

36:29.836 --> 36:31.804
Very well, then.

36:39.813 --> 36:40.846
Take will.

36:40.848 --> 36:41.681
What?!

36:42.716 --> 36:43.783
Good girl.

36:44.818 --> 36:46.319
Y-you can't be serious.

36:46.321 --> 36:47.453
There's too much
at stake, Will.

36:47.455 --> 36:48.254
I can't let my
personal feelings

36:48.256 --> 36:49.121
cloud my judgement.

36:49.123 --> 36:50.856
Are you sure, Helen?

36:52.426 --> 36:54.427
He's younger, stronger--

36:54.429 --> 36:56.729
I beg your pardon.

36:56.731 --> 36:57.863
Okay, Magnus,
the joke is over.

36:57.865 --> 36:59.699
His blood is untainted.

36:59.701 --> 37:00.733
He's a blank slate.

37:00.735 --> 37:02.301
Magnus!

37:02.303 --> 37:04.203
Ah, a fresh start.

37:04.205 --> 37:06.172
I do see the appeal.

37:06.174 --> 37:07.440
Have you lost your mind?

37:07.442 --> 37:08.374
Yes.

37:08.376 --> 37:11.077
Quite literally.

37:11.079 --> 37:13.212
I'm truly sorry, Will.

37:13.214 --> 37:15.381
What do you call it?

37:15.383 --> 37:17.216
I don't know,
"un-deading" device.

37:18.152 --> 37:19.619
It look anything like

37:19.621 --> 37:21.120
the one they used to
revive you in Praxis?

37:21.122 --> 37:22.989
Nope, not even close,

37:22.991 --> 37:24.323
but I'm hoping
it's the same engine

37:24.325 --> 37:26.058
in a different chassis.

37:26.060 --> 37:27.059
Hoping?

37:27.061 --> 37:28.060
That's all I got.

37:29.262 --> 37:32.298
You know,
if this doesn't work...

37:32.300 --> 37:33.399
Yeah?

37:33.401 --> 37:35.267
We could end up
reviving their bodies

37:35.269 --> 37:37.103
and leaving their minds behind.

37:37.105 --> 37:38.738
Yeah.

37:38.740 --> 37:41.707
Well, let's hope they're kicking
some virtual butt in there.

37:41.709 --> 37:44.176
Yeah...

38:00.494 --> 38:02.762
Mmm...

38:02.764 --> 38:03.796
Oh, you're right, Helen.

38:03.798 --> 38:06.298
The boy does feel fresh,

38:06.300 --> 38:07.933
kind of like

38:07.935 --> 38:10.102
putting on a fresh pair
of socks.

38:10.104 --> 38:11.237
Dear God.

38:16.810 --> 38:18.344
Well...

38:18.346 --> 38:22.948
It's shaping up to be a grand
and glorious day, isn't it?

38:26.864 --> 38:29.432
Now the world will
bow down before me.

38:29.434 --> 38:30.533
Good grief,

38:30.535 --> 38:31.434
the melodrama.

38:31.436 --> 38:33.102
Jealous?

38:34.838 --> 38:36.406
I'll be out in the real world
with Will's body

38:36.408 --> 38:40.343
while you'll be trapped in here
in this virtual hell forever.

38:40.345 --> 38:41.844
And meanwhile,

38:41.846 --> 38:43.112
the nanite spreads like a virus
to computers everywhere.

38:43.114 --> 38:45.114
Total
global domination.

38:45.116 --> 38:48.851
You know, I am a tad jealous.

38:48.853 --> 38:51.320
It's kind of the best
of both worlds, isn't it?

38:51.322 --> 38:52.355
And I couldn't have done it

38:52.357 --> 38:55.124
without you two crazy kids.

38:57.361 --> 38:58.761
So this is goodbye.

38:58.763 --> 39:00.496
Not that it hasn't been...

39:00.498 --> 39:01.697
Fun.

39:01.699 --> 39:03.533
You sure you don't
need an assistant?

39:03.535 --> 39:07.236
I'll leave you both
to your eternity now.

39:09.907 --> 39:13.609
Have a nice virtual life.

39:24.154 --> 39:25.888
Problem, Adam?

39:28.292 --> 39:29.358
What have you done, witch?

39:29.360 --> 39:31.727
Oh, yes,
I forgot to mention--

39:36.200 --> 39:37.934
You're not in control anymore.

39:37.936 --> 39:39.669
Elvis has left the building,
my man.

39:40.804 --> 39:41.804
Impossible.

39:41.806 --> 39:43.272
I'm running the show
from here on.

39:43.274 --> 39:44.607
How did you--

39:44.609 --> 39:45.575
Wouldn't you like to know?

39:45.577 --> 39:46.809
I love where this is going.

39:46.811 --> 39:48.778
I've quarantined
the Praxian nanite...

39:48.780 --> 39:51.914
This time for real,

39:51.916 --> 39:53.349
and so,

39:53.351 --> 39:55.518
without further adieu...

40:00.591 --> 40:02.558
Goodbye, Adam.

40:03.994 --> 40:06.462
Forever.

40:12.536 --> 40:14.770
Damn you!

40:16.440 --> 40:18.040
Say something.

40:18.042 --> 40:18.875
Magnus?

40:18.877 --> 40:20.209
Hello.

40:20.211 --> 40:21.978
We made it.

40:21.980 --> 40:22.879
Pinch me.

40:22.881 --> 40:23.713
Okay.

40:23.715 --> 40:24.780
How'd I do in there?

40:24.782 --> 40:26.282
Well, you were
a bit stubborn at first,

40:26.284 --> 40:27.316
but in the end,
you were brilliant.

40:27.318 --> 40:29.719
Well, your downloaded
consciousness was.

40:29.721 --> 40:30.820
Thanks.

40:30.822 --> 40:31.754
So, Worth
took the bait?

40:31.756 --> 40:33.122
He believed that
your physical body

40:33.124 --> 40:34.524
was hooked up as well.

40:34.526 --> 40:38.661
When all along it was just
this little fellow.

40:38.663 --> 40:39.762
Adam tried to escape,

40:39.764 --> 40:40.930
he got trapped,

40:40.932 --> 40:42.565
we now have control.

40:42.567 --> 40:44.667
I never thought it would pay
to have my brain sucked.

40:44.669 --> 40:45.835
So Worth's
consciousness

40:45.837 --> 40:47.503
has a new home.

40:47.505 --> 40:48.638
Forever and ever,

40:48.640 --> 40:50.540
amen.

40:51.975 --> 40:53.276
So, the quarantine held?

40:53.278 --> 40:54.744
Like a rock.

40:54.746 --> 40:56.078
Minus the psychotic
Adam Worth interface,

40:56.080 --> 40:56.913
I trust.

40:56.915 --> 40:58.014
Oh, yeah.

40:58.016 --> 40:59.649
I've migrated the nanite
to an ISO drive.

40:59.651 --> 41:02.652
It won't be
going anywhere ever again.

41:02.654 --> 41:03.819
Something tells me

41:03.821 --> 41:05.221
you've got plans
for that thing.

41:05.223 --> 41:07.990
Well, it may be the only
surviving record

41:07.992 --> 41:09.425
of an entire society.

41:09.427 --> 41:11.561
A seed that could help
Kate and Garris

41:11.563 --> 41:13.396
as they try to rebuild Praxis.

41:13.398 --> 41:15.665
You'll need somebody
to take it down there.

41:15.667 --> 41:17.767
Do you have anyone in mind?

41:17.769 --> 41:19.535
Well...

41:20.571 --> 41:21.871
You?

41:21.873 --> 41:23.506
Yeah, why not?

41:23.508 --> 41:24.874
I have a few
vacation days coming up.

41:24.876 --> 41:26.676
Indeed.

41:26.678 --> 41:27.877
It'd be nice
to see Kate again.

41:27.879 --> 41:29.545
Yeah.

41:29.547 --> 41:31.314
I miss the little runt
running around the house.

41:32.683 --> 41:34.317
Consider yourself volunteered.

41:35.586 --> 41:36.519
Thank you.

41:46.964 --> 41:48.297
I hope it's better

41:48.299 --> 41:49.398
than that bilious concoction
you made us drink.

41:49.400 --> 41:50.533
What was that?

41:50.535 --> 41:52.134
Protein supplement

41:52.136 --> 41:55.438
to counteract the effects
of the Praxian stasis.

41:55.440 --> 41:56.639
Terrible.

41:56.641 --> 41:57.473
Oh, well, whatever.

41:57.475 --> 41:58.774
The point is,
we're here now.

41:58.776 --> 41:59.976
Yes, we are.

41:59.978 --> 42:01.444
I've got my body,

42:01.446 --> 42:02.845
and you've
certainly got yours.

42:02.847 --> 42:04.880
Oh, dear Lord...

42:04.882 --> 42:06.048
So tell me
something, Sophie.

42:06.050 --> 42:07.917
Back there in crazy town,

42:07.919 --> 42:10.620
when you had to choose
between sacrificing Will

42:10.622 --> 42:11.454
or <i> moi</i> ...

42:11.456 --> 42:12.855
Yes..?

42:12.857 --> 42:14.890
I mean, if it had been
a real choice...

42:14.892 --> 42:17.660
If you hadn't stacked the deck
in favor of the house...

42:17.662 --> 42:19.528
Whom would I have chosen?

42:20.564 --> 42:21.597
Yeah, kinda.

42:21.599 --> 42:23.099
Aw, Nikola.

42:24.801 --> 42:26.068
Do you really need to ask?

42:28.071 --> 42:30.373
Cheers.

42:30.398 --> 42:34.398
