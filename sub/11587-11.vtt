CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:11.212 --> 00:13.347
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:15.216 --> 00:16.684
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:16.717 --> 00:19.220
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:19.253 --> 00:23.124
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:23.157 --> 00:25.393
- HEY, COME ON, NICK,
YOU GOTTA NEATEN IT UP, MAN.

00:25.426 --> 00:27.161
YOU CAN'T BE ALL MESSY
CRUISING A GAY BAR.

00:27.195 --> 00:29.397
- HEY, WE CAN'T ALL
LOOK LIKE AL SHARPTON.

00:29.430 --> 00:33.667
- DUDE, IN THERE,
I'M AN ABERZOMBIE FASHIONISTE.

00:37.438 --> 00:39.173
- THEY MAKE A CUTE COUPLE.

00:39.207 --> 00:41.575
- [scoffs]

00:41.609 --> 00:44.145
- YOU THINK THIS WILL WORK?

00:44.178 --> 00:46.414

IS A FIT-LOOKING MALE.

00:46.447 --> 00:49.717
WHITE, BETWEEN 25 AND 40,
WITH BLONDE HAIR,

00:49.750 --> 00:51.185
HITTING ON OTHER MEN.

00:51.219 --> 00:52.753

TO HALF OF CHELSEA.

00:52.786 --> 00:55.189
- WELL, COP INSTINCTS.

00:55.223 --> 00:58.859
I GUESS FIN AND AMARO WILL
JUST HAVE TO SORT THROUGH THEM.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.229
- HE HAS TO MEET YOU
ON A FRIDAY NIGHT?

01:01.262 --> 01:03.131
- HONEY, IT'S AN ACQUISITION.

01:03.164 --> 01:04.332
HE CAN'T BE SEEN TALKING
TO THE OTHER SIDE'S LAWYER.

01:04.365 --> 01:05.733
- WELL, TELL HIM
TO COME TO CONNECTICUT.

01:05.766 --> 01:08.169
MY MOTHER WILL
BAKE HIM MUFFINS.

01:08.202 --> 01:10.771
- MELISSA. I'LL TAKE
AN EARLY TRAIN, I PROMISE.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.673
- I JUST DON'T LIKE
DRIVING AT NIGHT.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.175
- HEY, HUNTER
WILL BE YOUR CO-PILOT.

01:14.208 --> 01:16.310
WON'T YOU, BUDDY?
- YEAH.

01:16.344 --> 01:18.112
IF I CAN SIT IN THE FRONT SEAT.
- DEAL.

01:18.146 --> 01:19.180
YOU BE GOOD FOR YOUR MOM,
ALL RIGHT?

01:19.213 --> 01:23.517

02:13.567 --> 02:15.269
- [sighs]
YOU WANT A DRINK?

02:15.303 --> 02:17.805
- WHY NOT?

02:20.974 --> 02:25.279
- HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?
I CAN GET YOU SOME ICE.

02:25.313 --> 02:27.715
- STRAIGHT, LIKE YOU.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.217
- [chuckles]

02:29.250 --> 02:31.852
IF I WERE STRAIGHT,
WE WOULDN'T BE HERE.

02:31.885 --> 02:36.357
BUT I'M GLAD WE ARE.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.725
YOU HAVE NICE EYES.

02:37.758 --> 02:40.194
- I'VE GOT SOME
OTHER NICE PARTS TOO.

02:40.228 --> 02:43.231
YOU WANT TO SEE THEM?

02:52.773 --> 02:54.208
[cell phone ringing]

02:54.242 --> 02:57.245
- [muffled groaning]

03:54.935 --> 03:56.770
- THE HOTEL ONLY HAS CAMERAS
IN THE FRONT.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.606
CHARLES MURPHY
CHECKED IN ALONE,

03:58.639 --> 04:01.442
SO HIS COMPANY MUST HAVE USED
A SIDE DOOR.

04:01.475 --> 04:02.743
YOU KNOW, I THINK
I SAW HIM LAST NIGHT.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.044
HE WALKED RIGHT BY US.
- HIS BAD LUCK.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.714
WHOEVER PICKED HIM UP
DID HIS USUAL NUMBER.

04:06.747 --> 04:10.718
- TIED HIM UP.
REAR ENTRY. STOLE HIS WALLET.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.052
- LOOKS LIKE.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.287
PLUS HE BEAT HIM UP
PRETTY BADLY.

04:13.321 --> 04:14.722
OUR PERP IS ESCALATING.

04:14.755 --> 04:18.025
HE'S GOT FIVE MISSED CALLS,

04:18.058 --> 04:22.963
AND I'M GUESSING HE WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE WITH THEM.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.934
CRAGEN'S AT ONE P.P.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.669
THEY WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
HOW THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED

04:28.702 --> 04:30.338
WHEN WE WERE ON THE SCENE.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.005
- MAYBE BECAUSE THERE'S
FOUR OF US AND 400 GAY BARS?

04:32.039 --> 04:33.707
- AND NONE OF THE PREVIOUS VICS
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

04:33.741 --> 04:36.944
ARMSTRONG, HE SAYS HE DOESN'T
REMEMBER ANYTHING ELSE,

04:36.977 --> 04:39.380
AND ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY
DO NOT COME DOWN TO HIS OFFICE.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.948
- JACKSON'S ON
A CRUISE TO NOWHERE

04:40.981 --> 04:42.082
WITH HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTERS.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.984
- CLOSETED GAY MEN.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.486
THIS PERP SURE KNOWS
HOW TO PICK A VICTIM.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.888
- AND IF THERE ARE FOUR
THAT WE KNOW ABOUT,

04:47.921 --> 04:49.823
I MEAN, THERE COULD BE 20
THAT NEVER REPORTED IT.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.959
- YEAH, OKAY, THANK YOU.
[hangs up phone]

04:51.992 --> 04:55.796
CHARLES MURPHY JUST WOKE UP.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.965
[knock on door]

04:57.998 --> 05:02.936
- MRS. MURPHY?
WE'RE DETECTIVES.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.572
- JUST LOOK AT HIM.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.106
HAVE YOU FOUND THE MAN
WHO ATTACKED MY HUSBAND?

05:06.139 --> 05:07.975
- MELISSA, PLEASE.
- WE'RE WORKING ON IT.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.710
- WHY DID HE
HAVE TO HURT HIM?

05:09.743 --> 05:11.745
CHARLES WOULD HAVE
JUST GIVEN HIM HIS WALLET.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.013
- HIS WALLET?

05:13.046 --> 05:15.816
- DO YOU KNOW
WHO YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?

05:15.849 --> 05:17.451
HAS HE MUGGED OTHER PEOPLE?

05:17.485 --> 05:20.454
- MRS. MURPHY,
COULD WE GET A LIST

05:20.488 --> 05:22.490
OF THE CREDIT CARDS
THAT WERE IN HIS WALLET?

05:22.523 --> 05:24.124
- THERE'S ONE AT HOME
IN MY DESK.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.026
- I'M NOT LEAVING YOU NOW.
- OH, IT WOULD BE A HUGE HELP.

05:26.059 --> 05:31.031
- HONEY, PLEASE.
IT'S OKAY. IT'S FINE.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.700
- I'LL BE QUICK.

05:32.733 --> 05:35.669
- THANK YOU.

05:39.407 --> 05:41.975
- A MUGGER?
- WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO SAY?

05:42.009 --> 05:44.678
WE'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR 16 YEARS.
WE HAVE THREE KIDS.

05:44.712 --> 05:48.081
- WELL, CAN YOU AT LEAST
TELL US WHAT HAPPENED?

05:48.115 --> 05:49.950
- LOOK, I WON'T
BE ABLE TO TESTIFY.

05:49.983 --> 05:53.621
- YOU CAN DECIDE THAT LATER.
FIRST JUST HELP US GET THIS GUY.

05:53.654 --> 05:57.090
- LOOK, I DON'T
REMEMBER VERY MUCH.

05:57.124 --> 05:58.959
I HAD HAD A LOT TO DRINK.

05:58.992 --> 06:02.563
- MR. MURPHY, HE'S DONE THIS
FOUR TIMES THAT WE KNOW OF,

06:02.596 --> 06:05.433
HURTING THEM WORSE
AS HE GOES ALONG.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.100
- HE TARGETS PEOPLE
JUST LIKE YOU.

06:07.134 --> 06:09.703
PEOPLE IN PLACES
THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE.

06:13.774 --> 06:16.477
- [inhales]
I GET THESE URGES.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.812
I TRY TO FIGHT THEM.
I TRY TO PUSH THEM DOWN.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.481
- NOBODY'S JUDGING YOU.
- MAYBE YOU'RE NOT.

06:20.514 --> 06:23.551
BUT MY FIRM
IS NOT GAY-FRIENDLY.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.986
AND MY WIFE...

06:26.019 --> 06:28.989
IF I LOSE MY WIFE,
IF I LOSE MY FAMILY,

06:29.022 --> 06:30.491
I LOSE EVERYTHING.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.660
- WE HAVE NO DESIRE
TO HURT YOUR FAMILY.

06:32.693 --> 06:33.927
- THEN LEAVE US ALONE.
- MR. MURPHY--

06:33.961 --> 06:37.064
- I'M SORRY, OKAY?

06:37.097 --> 06:40.601
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.614
- EVERYTHING HERE IS LEGAL,
AND HAVING COPS AROUND

06:53.647 --> 06:56.149
IS NOT GOOD
FOR MY BUSINESS.

06:56.183 --> 06:58.619
- DEFENSIVE MUCH?
- OH, SORRY.

06:58.652 --> 07:01.021
WERE YOU HERE
TO BUY A DOUBLE-BUBBLER?

07:01.054 --> 07:02.656
- NO, WE'RE HERE
ABOUT CHARLES MURPHY.

07:02.690 --> 07:05.793
HE BOUGHT A $200 WATER PIPE,
CHARGED IT ON HIS AMEX

07:05.826 --> 07:07.027
LAST NIGHT AT 2:00 AM.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.796
- OKAY, IS THERE A PROBLEM?

07:08.829 --> 07:10.163
- THAT WASN'T CHARLES MURPHY,
THAT WAS THE GUY

07:10.197 --> 07:11.632
WHO STOLE HIS CREDIT CARD.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.000
- A BLACK CARD,
YOU DON'T I.D.?

07:13.033 --> 07:15.135
- THE CUSTOMERS
AREN'T BIG FANS OF THAT.

07:15.168 --> 07:16.203
THERE WASN'T
A STOP ON THE CARD.

07:16.236 --> 07:17.971
- YEAH, HE HADN'T
REPORTED IT YET.

07:18.005 --> 07:19.206
HE WAS TIED UP.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.141
- YOU GOT ANY SURVEILLANCE VIDEO
IN HERE?

07:21.174 --> 07:23.010
NO?

07:23.043 --> 07:25.546
CUSTOMERS AREN'T BIG FANS
OF THAT EITHER, HUH?

07:25.579 --> 07:26.980
- YOU REMEMBER THE GUY?

07:27.014 --> 07:29.717
- 5'10". BLONDE HAIR.
GAY FACE.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.251
- GAY FACE?

07:31.284 --> 07:32.853
OKAY, YOU'RE GONNA COME DOWN
TO THE STATION WITH US

07:32.886 --> 07:34.254
AND HELP US
MAKE A SKETCH.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.890
- I CAN'T JUST CLOSE MY STORE.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.592
[bell rings]

07:41.862 --> 07:43.196
- NO, THAT'S FINE.

07:43.230 --> 07:45.132
WE'LL JUST HANG OUT HERE
AND KEEP YOU COMPANY

07:45.165 --> 07:48.602
UNTIL CLOSING TIME.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.905
[keys jingling]
MM-HM.

07:51.939 --> 07:54.875
- HEY, COME ON, JACE.
- I'M LOOKING, I'M LOOKING.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.243
KEEP YOUR VOICES DOWN.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.145
- SO YOU DON'T WANT
YOUR CUSTOMERS TO KNOW

07:58.178 --> 07:59.212
THERE'S A VIOLENT PREDATOR
OUT THERE?

07:59.246 --> 08:00.981
- KIND OF DAMPENS
THE PARTY MOOD.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.916
- YEAH, WELL, WHEN HE TIES
THEM UP AND RAPES THEM,

08:02.950 --> 08:04.718
THAT'S KIND
OF A DOWNER TOO.

08:04.752 --> 08:07.120
SOME OF THESE MUSSYS, THAT'D
JUST BE ANOTHER THRILL.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.557
- WHATEVER HAPPENED TO SAFE SEX?
- SO LAST CENTURY.

08:09.590 --> 08:10.858
ANYWAYS, WE DON'T GET
THE BUCKS COUNTY

08:10.891 --> 08:12.059
ANTIQUING CROWD IN HERE.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.694
- OH, SO THEY'D
RATHER GET ASSAULTED?

08:13.727 --> 08:15.062
- THAN BUY THAT
PERFECT SIDEBOARD?

08:15.095 --> 08:16.864
YEAH.
RISK ADDS THRILL TO LIFE.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.632
DON'T YOU EVER GET BORED?

08:18.666 --> 08:21.001
- WELL, MEETING PEOPLE LIKE YOU
CERTAINLY KEEPS IT FRESH.

08:21.034 --> 08:24.638
- ANYWAY, I DON'T KNOW HIM.

08:27.107 --> 08:30.277
- FIN, GUY IN A GREY SUIT,
RED SCARF, STEPPING OUT.

08:32.746 --> 08:35.182
- HEY, HOLD UP A SECOND.
- YEAH.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.750
- WHAT?

08:36.784 --> 08:38.218
- HEY, YOU SAW US.
YOU SAW THE PICTURE.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.953
YOU TOOK OFF PRETTY FAST.

08:39.987 --> 08:42.790
- I'M LATE FOR A DINNER.
- WITH WHO? YOUR WIFE?

08:42.823 --> 08:45.192
- LOOK, I DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING WRONG.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.160
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.
- SO WHAT'S THE RUSH?

08:47.194 --> 08:48.596
- MAYBE WE SHOULD
CALL YOUR WIFE,

08:48.629 --> 08:50.864
TELL HER YOU'RE
GONNA BE LATE.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.833
- ALL RIGHT.
I SAW HIM EARLIER.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.968
I JUST--I DIDN'T
WANT TO GET INVOLVED.

08:55.002 --> 08:58.305
- WELL, YOU'RE INVOLVED.

08:58.338 --> 09:00.974
- HE TRIED TO PICK ME UP.
HE WANTED TO GO TO A HOTEL ROOM.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.710
I GOT A BAD FEELING.

09:02.743 --> 09:05.145
- WHERE IS HE NOW?

09:05.178 --> 09:07.280
- HE MOVED ON
TO SOMEBODY ELSE.

09:07.314 --> 09:09.316
DARK SUIT, RED TIE.
THEY LEFT TOGETHER.

09:09.349 --> 09:10.884
THEY WENT THAT WAY,
I THINK.

09:10.918 --> 09:13.053
- COUPLE NEW HOTELS OFF 7th.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.357
- FIN AND AMARO STRUCK OUT
AT THE HOLLISTER,

09:17.390 --> 09:19.159
THEY'RE TRYING THE DUCHESS.
- OKAY.

09:19.192 --> 09:20.894
SO MAYBE IT'S OUR
SINGLE GUY IN A SUIT.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.329
HARRY DUNLEAVY.
NO BAGGAGE.

09:22.362 --> 09:24.197
- HERE WE GO.

09:24.231 --> 09:28.068
MR. DUNLEAVY?
MAID SERVICE.

09:28.101 --> 09:31.004
MR. DUNLEAVY?

09:33.874 --> 09:36.677
[doorknob clicks]

09:36.710 --> 09:38.679
- DAMN.

09:38.712 --> 09:40.013
- [sighs]

09:40.047 --> 09:42.783
- HIS COMPANY SPLIT.
HOW IS HE?

09:42.816 --> 09:45.152
- NOT BREATHING.
- SVU PORTABLE.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.254
WE NEED A BUS
TO THE RIXTON HOTEL.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.923
- HE'S GONE.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.730
[sighs]

10:01.001 --> 10:02.636
- I CAME FROM
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER

10:02.670 --> 10:03.971
AND THEY SAID I SHOULD
TALK TO YOU ABOUT HARRY.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.639
- WE'RE SO SORRY,
MRS. DUNLEAVY.

10:05.673 --> 10:07.675
- THEY SAY HE DIED
OF A HEART ATTACK,

10:07.708 --> 10:09.409
BUT THERE WERE PRECIPITATING
CIRCUMSTANCES--

10:09.442 --> 10:12.780
- WHY DON'T YOU
HAVE A SEAT.

10:12.813 --> 10:15.182
- UM, HE SUFFERED
FROM A HEART CONDITION,

10:15.215 --> 10:17.017
BUT IT WAS UNDER CONTROL.

10:17.050 --> 10:22.022
I MEAN, WHAT
PRECIPITATING CIRCUMSTANCES?

10:22.055 --> 10:24.391
- MRS. DUNLEAVY,
YOUR--YOUR HUSBAND

10:24.424 --> 10:26.393
WAS A VICTIM OF A CRIME.

10:26.426 --> 10:29.963
- WHAT KIND OF CRIME?
WHERE WAS HE?

10:29.997 --> 10:33.400
- IN A HOTEL IN CHELSEA.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.769
- A CRIME IN A HOTEL?

10:35.803 --> 10:39.673
- HE WAS APPARENTLY ASSAULTED.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.277
- I ALWAYS TOLD HIM
HE SHOULD BE CAREFUL

10:44.311 --> 10:46.714
WITH THOSE BOYS
HE PICKED UP.

10:49.216 --> 10:53.854
- SO YOU KNEW
ABOUT HIS...ACTIVITIES?

10:53.887 --> 10:56.790
- OF COURSE.

10:56.824 --> 11:00.293
I WAS HIS WIFE.
12 YEARS.

11:00.327 --> 11:03.430
OUR ANNIVERSARY IS TOMORROW.

11:03.463 --> 11:07.768
- WELL, NOT ALL MEN
WOULD TELL THEIR WIVES.

11:07.801 --> 11:10.437
- HARRY JUST LIKED
TO BLOW OFF STEAM SOMETIMES.

11:10.470 --> 11:14.207
BUT HE WAS CONSIDERATE.

11:14.241 --> 11:17.778
HE KNEW IT WOULD HURT ME
IF HE CHEATED ON ME.

11:17.811 --> 11:20.881
- IF HE CHEATED ON YOU?

11:20.914 --> 11:23.784
- WITH WOMEN.

11:30.791 --> 11:33.761
I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.428
EVERY MARRIAGE IS DIFFERENT.

11:35.462 --> 11:39.800
OURS WAS JUST
A LITTLE MORE DIFFERENT

11:39.833 --> 11:43.103
THAN OTHERS.

11:43.136 --> 11:47.507
BUT WE LOVED EACH OTHER.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.410
"LOVE YOU MADLY."

11:50.443 --> 11:54.214
THAT'S WHAT
HE ALWAYS SAID TO ME.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.884
"LOVE YOU MADLY."

12:01.421 --> 12:04.758
- DETECTIVES, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO TELL YOU.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.293
- WELL, WE JUST HAVE
A FEW MORE QUESTIONS.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.295
- I TOLD YOU,
I DON'T REMEMBER--

12:08.328 --> 12:10.530
- YOU BETTER START REMEMBERING

12:10.563 --> 12:11.899
BECAUSE HE DID IT AGAIN,
MR. MURPHY.

12:11.932 --> 12:14.501
ONLY THIS TIME...

12:14.534 --> 12:17.170
HE KILLED SOMEONE.

12:17.204 --> 12:18.538
- GOOD GOD.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.008
- YEAH, SO WE'RE
REALLY LOSING INTEREST

12:21.041 --> 12:23.476
IN COVERING FOR YOU
WITH YOUR WIFE.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.512
- HE KILLED SOMEONE.

12:25.545 --> 12:31.051
- BEAT HIM INTO A HEART ATTACK.
THAT'S MURDER.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.552
- [exhales]

12:32.585 --> 12:35.555
LOOK, YOU ALL SAID THAT
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO HURT ME.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.424
- WE DID AND WE'RE SORRY,

12:37.457 --> 12:40.293
BUT THIS IS GOING
TO MAKE THE NEWS

12:40.327 --> 12:43.030
AND YOUR NAME
WILL COME OUT.

12:43.063 --> 12:46.033
[children laughing]

12:55.542 --> 12:57.811
- I MET HIM AT A BAR.

12:57.845 --> 13:03.250
I THINK IT WAS CALLED
NEW YORK JUNK.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.018
HE SAID HIS NAME WAS DIRK.

13:05.052 --> 13:07.254
- DIRK.
ANY LAST NAME?

13:07.287 --> 13:09.489
- I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE
IT WAS JUST A STAGE NAME.

13:09.522 --> 13:13.260
I RECOGNIZED HIM FROM A, UM...

13:13.293 --> 13:17.030
FROM A STRIP CLUB.

13:17.064 --> 13:19.366
IT WAS--IT WAS HUNK NIGHT.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.037
[dance music playing]

13:24.071 --> 13:25.605
- GOTTA SERVE THE MARKET,
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

13:25.638 --> 13:27.607
IT'S NOT ALL
HORNY STRAIGHT GUYS.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.109
I MEAN, WE ALREADY
GOT THE STAGE.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.443
WHY NOT BRING IN THE GAYS

13:30.477 --> 13:32.212
AND SOME HORNY LADIES
ONCE A WEEK?

13:32.245 --> 13:33.580
- THAT'S VERY ENLIGHTENED
OF YOU.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.282
- NO. IT'S BUSINESS.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.516
I'D DO A NAKED DOG SHOW
IF DOGS HAD MONEY

13:36.549 --> 13:38.551
AND THEY WEREN'T
ALREADY NAKED.

13:38.585 --> 13:41.855
- I'M CONFUSED ABOUT THIS
NAKED FASHION SHOW.

13:41.889 --> 13:43.490
I MEAN, IF THEY DON'T
HAVE ANY CLOTHES ON--

13:43.523 --> 13:46.359
- NO, NO, NO--
- OKAY, THAT'S GREAT.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.261
THIS IS WHO
WE'RE INTERESTED IN.

13:48.295 --> 13:49.930
GOES BY THE NAME OF DIRK.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.198
- YEAH, THAT'S
NOT HIS REAL NAME.

13:51.231 --> 13:53.066
- WE FIGURED THAT.
- JEREMY JONES.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.501
I HAD TO LET HIM GO.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.103
HE DIDN'T SHOW UP
HALF THE TIME HE WAS BOOKED.

13:56.136 --> 13:58.939
HE WAS A REAL ATTITUDE CASE.
WHAT DID HE DO?

13:58.972 --> 14:02.209
- HIS ATTITUDE'S OUT OF CONTROL.
YOU GOT AN ADDRESS ON HIM?

14:02.242 --> 14:06.046
- ANYTHING FOR THE NYPD.

14:06.079 --> 14:09.049
- DETECTIVE TUTUOLA.
- INGRID. WHAT'S UP?

14:09.082 --> 14:11.184
- HI.
I LIKE THE NEW HAIRCUT.

14:11.218 --> 14:13.053
- YEAH, THANK YOU.
GOOD SEEING YOU.

14:13.086 --> 14:17.590
TAKE CARE.

14:17.624 --> 14:20.160
AN ACQUAINTANCE
FROM MY UNDERCOVER DAYS.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.628
- JONES'S ADDRESS.

14:21.661 --> 14:25.933
- REALLY? YOUR UNDERCOVER NAME
WAS "DETECTIVE TUTUOLA"?

14:25.966 --> 14:28.902
- POLICE! SEARCH WARRANT!

14:28.936 --> 14:30.337
- WHAT?

14:30.370 --> 14:32.339
- JEREMY JONES?
- YOU COULD HAVE KNOCKED FIRST.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.907
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
- WHAT ARE YOU--

14:33.941 --> 14:35.175
- GET DOWN. GET DOWN!

14:35.208 --> 14:36.409
- [grunts]
- GET DOWN!

14:36.443 --> 14:37.577
- YOU TOO.
- WHY?

14:37.610 --> 14:39.579
- POSSESSION OF STOLEN PROPERTY.

14:39.612 --> 14:42.015
COME ON, LET'S GO.

14:42.049 --> 14:44.617
- JEREMY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
- DO WORRY, MASON.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.588
- HOW COME I DON'T
SEE MORE GAY COPS?

14:48.621 --> 14:50.557
- YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT
WHAT WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT.

14:50.590 --> 14:53.526
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.462
- YOU'VE BEEN IDENTIFIED,
JONES.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.264
YEAH, WE KNOW YOU'VE
BEEN PICKING UP GUYS

14:57.297 --> 14:58.498
AND MESSING THEM UP.

14:58.531 --> 15:00.600
- YOU KNOW,
I DO SEE SOME GAY COPS,

15:00.633 --> 15:02.569
USUALLY THE BIG, MACHO ONES.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.571
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF YOU WERE SMART,

15:04.604 --> 15:06.706
YOU WOULD TRY
TO DO YOURSELF SOME GOOD HERE.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.408
- RIGHT.

15:08.441 --> 15:12.645
WHY DON'T I START
BY GETTING A LAWYER?

15:13.746 --> 15:17.417
- WELL, THIS ONE
WILL BE A SLICE.

15:17.450 --> 15:20.120
- WE HAVE TWO OF HIS VICTIMS
COMING IN TO VIEW THE LINEUP,

15:20.153 --> 15:21.488
ARMSTRONG AND MURPHY.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.957
THE REST OF THEM MADE IT
A POINT OF NOT BEING AVAILABLE.

15:23.991 --> 15:26.726
- NEITHER IS THE MAN HE KILLED.
WHAT DO WE HAVE ON THAT?

15:26.759 --> 15:30.130
- A WITNESS WHO SAW JONES
LEAVING THE BAR WITH THE VICTIM.

15:30.163 --> 15:32.299
- ANYONE AT THE HOTEL
SEE JONES?

15:32.332 --> 15:34.334
FORENSICS? DNA?
FINGERPRINTS?

15:34.367 --> 15:36.036
- LOOK, WEARS A CONDOM,

15:36.069 --> 15:38.605
AND HE CLEANS UP AFTER HIMSELF
REALLY WELL.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.673
- MR. MURPHY IS HERE.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.342
- HERE WE GO.

15:44.511 --> 15:48.215
MR. MURPHY,
THANK YOU FOR COMING IN.

15:48.248 --> 15:52.185
- I'M RAFAEL BARBA,
LEAD PROSECUTOR ON THE CASE.

15:52.219 --> 15:53.453
- YEAH, YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT SURE THAT

15:53.486 --> 15:55.455
I'LL BE ABLE
TO RECOGNIZE ANYONE, SO...

15:55.488 --> 15:59.059
- YOU KNOW AT THE HOTEL,
BEFORE HE ATTACKED YOU--

15:59.092 --> 16:02.095
DID YOU KISS HIM?

16:02.129 --> 16:05.465
- [sighs]

16:05.498 --> 16:07.500
- THEN YOU GOT A GOOD LOOK
AT HIS FACE, DIDN'T YOU?

16:07.534 --> 16:10.370
- WE'RE LOOKING FOR
A KILLER, MR. MURPHY.

16:10.403 --> 16:11.571
YOU HAVE A CIVIC DUTY.

16:11.604 --> 16:13.373
- YOU DO KNOW THIS
IS THE END OF MY LIFE?

16:13.406 --> 16:15.042
- YOU'RE LUCKY
YOU'RE ALIVE AT ALL.

16:15.075 --> 16:17.444
- WE'RE GONNA BE WITH YOU
IN A FEW MOMENTS.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.612
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT
OVER HERE.

16:22.549 --> 16:26.386
"DID YOU KISS HIM?"
NICK, HE'S A VICTIM.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.621
- HE'S A VICTIM
IN SEARCH OF A CRIME.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.358
LOOK, IF HE'D HAVE
GOTTEN INTO THAT MERCEDES

16:31.391 --> 16:32.525
WITH HIS FAMILY
AND DRIVEN TO CONNECTICUT--

16:32.559 --> 16:34.794
- YOU MEAN LIKE
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO?

16:34.827 --> 16:37.097
- ALL I'M SAYING
IS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.180
- JUST TELL US
IF YOU RECOGNIZE ANYONE.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.482
- NO PROMPTING, DETECTIVE.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.350
- THAT'S NOT PROMPTING.

16:57.384 --> 17:00.553
- MR. MURPHY, JUST GO AHEAD.

17:08.595 --> 17:09.796
- IT'S NUMBER THREE.

17:09.829 --> 17:14.701
- WHAT ABOUT HIM?

17:14.734 --> 17:16.736
- HE'S THE ONE
WHO ATTACKED ME.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.474
[loud knock]

17:21.508 --> 17:25.612
- THANK YOU, SIR.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.415
- OKAY, THERE WAS
A PRESUPPOSITION

17:28.448 --> 17:30.150
THAT THE PERPETRATOR
WAS IN THAT LINEUP.

17:30.183 --> 17:32.185
- AN ISSUE THE SUPREME COURT
DECIDED ABOUT 100 YEARS AGO.

17:32.219 --> 17:36.656
I'M SORRY, WHERE DID
MR. JONES FIND YOU EXACTLY?

17:36.689 --> 17:39.626
- I HAND OUT MY CARDS
AT THE VILLAGE HALLOWEEN PARADE.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.628
- ADMIRABLE.
SO YOU KNOW THE PROTOCOL.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.163
NOW YOU GET TO GO IN THERE

17:43.196 --> 17:45.565
AND GIVE YOUR CLIENT
THE GOOD NEWS.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.634
- THE OTHER VICTIM,
ARMSTRONG, IS ON HIS WAY.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.436
SO IS THE WITNESS
WHO SAW JONES

17:49.469 --> 17:51.238
LEAVING THE BAR
WITH DUNLEAVY.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.872
- GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE ASSAULTS,
IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR THE MURDER.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.641
IS THERE ANYTHING
IN JONES'S APARTMENT?

17:54.674 --> 17:56.643
- NO, BUT WE PICKED UP JONES
WITH HIS LIVE-IN BOYFRIEND.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.178
- A MASON CLARK.

17:58.211 --> 18:00.213
HE'S ON PAROLE
FOR NARCOTICS POSSESSION.

18:00.247 --> 18:02.515
WE FOUND STOLEN MEDS
IN HIS UNDERWEAR DRAWER.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.484
THEY WERE MONOGRAMMED.

18:04.517 --> 18:08.221
- [sighs]
ENOUGH TO REVOKE HIS PAROLE.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.622
IF HE LIVES WITH JONES,

18:09.656 --> 18:12.559
HE PROBABLY KNOWS SOMETHING
WE CAN USE.

18:12.592 --> 18:13.826
- YOU BURST INTO OUR HOME.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.795
YOU SHACKLED JEREMY
LIKE AN ANIMAL.

18:15.828 --> 18:17.397
- WELL, JEREMY DIDN'T
GIVE US MUCH CHOICE.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.232
HE'S BEEN DOING
SOME BAD STUFF.

18:19.266 --> 18:20.533
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

18:20.567 --> 18:22.402
- LOOK, HERE'S THE THING,
MASON.

18:22.435 --> 18:23.903
WE DON'T THINK YOU
HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT,

18:23.936 --> 18:25.738
SO IT SEEMS A SHAME
TO SEND YOU TO PRISON.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.840
- WHY ME?
- THE HASH IN THE PIPE.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.642
THE PILLS.

18:29.676 --> 18:32.245
YOU'RE LOOKING AT
A COUPLE OF YEARS.

18:32.279 --> 18:35.648
- I CAN'T GO BACK TO PRISON.
- AND WE CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT.

18:35.682 --> 18:38.818
LOOK, JEREMY DOESN'T
DESERVE YOUR PROTECTION.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.653
- JEREMY IS GOOD TO ME.

18:40.687 --> 18:43.390
- SO YOU DON'T MIND
HE HAS SEX WITH OTHER MEN?

18:43.423 --> 18:45.158
- [scoffs] WHAT?
- YOU HAVE AN OPEN RELATIONSHIP?

18:45.192 --> 18:48.395
- HE DOESN'T DO THAT.
- BUT HE BRINGS HOME MONEY.

18:48.428 --> 18:49.596
WHERE DO YOU THINK
HE GETS IT?

18:49.629 --> 18:52.432
- HE SLEEPS WITH WOMEN, OKAY?

18:52.465 --> 18:53.866
THEY PAY HIM.
THEY GIVE HIM GIFTS.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.635
JEWELRY.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.337
LIKE THIS WATCH. SEE?

18:57.370 --> 18:58.705
HE GIVES THEM TO ME.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.573
IT'S ONLY WOMEN.
THAT'S NOT STEPPING OUT.

19:00.607 --> 19:06.413
- MASON, JEREMY WASN'T
WITH A WOMAN ON FRIDAY NIGHT.

19:06.446 --> 19:09.616
HE WAS WITH HIM.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.818
- NO, HE WAS WITH A WOMAN.
THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD ME.

19:11.851 --> 19:14.287
- AND THAT WATER PIPE
HE BROUGHT HOME,

19:14.321 --> 19:15.655
THE CHARGE SLIP.

19:15.688 --> 19:19.592
THAT WOMAN, HER NAME
IS CHARLES MURPHY.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.528
- THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.
- NO?

19:21.561 --> 19:23.596
AND JEREMY WAS OUT
SATURDAY NIGHT, WASN'T HE?

19:23.630 --> 19:25.632
- YEAH, HE WAS
WITH THE SAME WOMAN, OKAY?

19:25.665 --> 19:27.400
HE SAID THE HUSBAND
WAS AWAY OR SOMETHING.

19:27.434 --> 19:28.568
- WHAT TIME
DID HE GET HOME?

19:28.601 --> 19:31.538
- LATE.
AFTER MIDNIGHT.

19:31.571 --> 19:32.805
HE CAME HOME.
HE WAS ALL HYPED UP.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.341
I ASKED HIM WHAT WAS WRONG.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.976
HE SAID SOMETHING BAD
HAD HAPPENED.

19:37.009 --> 19:40.647
- WELL, THIS IS
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM, MASON.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.714
- [whispers]
OH, MY GOD.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.616
- OKAY.

19:43.650 --> 19:45.418
NO, YOU'VE GOT TO MOVE.
YOU CAN STOP NOW, DETECTIVES.

19:45.452 --> 19:46.653
- EXCUSE ME, COUNSELOR,
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE

19:46.686 --> 19:48.255
OF AN INTERROGATION.

19:48.288 --> 19:49.822
- MR. JONES HAS ASKED ME
TO REPRESENT MR. CLARK AS WELL.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.658
- WELL, HE'S ALREADY MADE
A VOLUNTARY STATEMENT.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.493
- DID HE?

19:53.526 --> 19:55.695
WELL IF IT CONCERNS ANYTHING
MR. JONES SAID TO HIM,

19:55.728 --> 19:56.929
YOU CAN'T USE IT.

19:56.963 --> 19:58.698
- WHY NOT?
HE DIDN'T ASK FOR A LAWYER.

19:58.731 --> 20:00.433
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

20:00.467 --> 20:02.302
ONE SPOUSE CAN'T TESTIFY
TO WHAT THE OTHER SPOUSE

20:02.335 --> 20:05.405
TOLD HIM IN CONFIDENCE.

20:05.438 --> 20:07.340
MR. CLARK ISN'T
MR. JONES'S BOYFRIEND.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.542
HE'S HIS HUSBAND.

20:19.686 --> 20:21.020
- IT'S CALLED
SPOUSAL PRIVILEGE.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.822
THE IDEA IS TO PROTECT
AND STRENGTHEN

20:22.855 --> 20:23.990
THE SACRED BOND
OF MARRIAGE,

20:24.023 --> 20:25.425
ASSUMING THESE TWO
ARE LEGALLY MARRIED.

20:25.458 --> 20:26.826
WHAT DO WE KNOW?

20:26.859 --> 20:28.828
- WELL, THEY WERE
MARRIED IN PROVINCETOWN.

20:28.861 --> 20:30.597
- ALL RIGHT.
BY WHOM? HOW LONG AGO?

20:30.630 --> 20:32.965
THEY USE THEIR LEGAL NAMES?

20:32.999 --> 20:35.902
MAYBE THERE'S A LOOPHOLE OR TWO
I CAN CRAWL THROUGH.

20:35.935 --> 20:38.037
WHAT?
THIS MAKES YOU UNCOMFORTABLE?

20:38.070 --> 20:40.006
- NO. I WANT TO GET
THIS GUY AS MUCH AS YOU DO.

20:40.039 --> 20:41.541
I'M JUST WONDERING,
WOULD YOU CHALLENGE

20:41.574 --> 20:42.909
A STRAIGHT MARRIAGE LIKE THIS?

20:42.942 --> 20:45.478
- IF I THOUGHT THE HUSBAND
WAS GOOD FOR A MURDER,

20:45.512 --> 20:48.981
I'D CROSS-EXAMINE
THE PRIEST.

20:53.453 --> 20:56.623
- MS. EFRON,
ARE YOU READY TO PROCEED?

20:56.656 --> 20:59.659
- MR. BARBA'S MOTION
IS CLEARLY RIDICULOUS.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.062
- THAT'S YOUR ARGUMENT?
OKAY. YOUR HONOR--

21:03.095 --> 21:05.765
- MS. EFRON, COULD YOU
BE A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC?

21:05.798 --> 21:07.567
- THE SPOUSAL PRIVILEGE
CLEARLY APPLIES.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.569
MR. JONES AND MR. CLARK
ARE MARRIED.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.571
- NOT IN NEW YORK,
WHICH IS WHERE WE HAPPEN TO BE.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.306
- NEW YORK RECOGNIZES
ALL MARRIAGES

21:13.340 --> 21:14.741
PERFORMED IN OTHER STATES.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.309
- IT DOES NOW, BUT AT THE TIME
MR. JONES AND MR. CLARK

21:16.343 --> 21:17.610
WERE MARRIED,
THERE WAS NO SUCH THING

21:17.644 --> 21:19.312
AS SAME-SEX MARRIAGE
IN NEW YORK.

21:19.346 --> 21:22.014
- RETROACTIVE RECOGNITION
CLEARLY APPLIED.

21:22.048 --> 21:23.616
- RECOGNITION OF WHAT?

21:23.650 --> 21:24.817
THE DEFENDANT'S SO-CALLED
WEDDING IN MASSACHUSETTS

21:24.851 --> 21:26.719
WAS PERFORMED BY
AN UNDERAGE BARTENDER.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.888
- IRRELEVANT. THE BARTENDER
IS AN ORDAINED MINISTER.

21:28.921 --> 21:31.924
- MAIL-ORDER FROM THE CHURCH
OF HAPPY SKIES.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.025
PLUS, WE HAVE AFFIDAVITS
FROM WITNESSES

21:33.059 --> 21:35.027
THAT BOTH CELEBRANTS
WERE INEBRIATED.

21:35.061 --> 21:37.530
- PLEASE! IF BEING DRUNK
INVALIDATES A MARRIAGE,

21:37.564 --> 21:39.566
THEN HALF THE COUPLES
IN MANHATTAN ARE LIVING IN SIN.

21:39.599 --> 21:44.070
YOUR HONOR, I HAVE THE
BARTENDER'S CLERGY CERTIFICATE

21:44.103 --> 21:47.974
AND MY CLIENTS'
MARRIAGE LICENSE.

21:48.007 --> 21:50.877
- ASSUMING
THESE ARE VALID...

21:55.548 --> 22:00.353
I'M GONNA SIDE HERE
WITH THE RIGHTS OF MAN AND MAN.

22:00.387 --> 22:01.788
THE SPOUSAL PRIVILEGE
APPLIES.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.924
- THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

22:06.926 --> 22:09.061
- SHE'S BETTER THAN YOU THOUGHT,
ISN'T SHE?

22:09.095 --> 22:11.664
- I CHARGE
VERY REASONABLE RATES, TOO.

22:11.698 --> 22:14.734
NOW THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT
THE LAW APPLIES TO EVERYONE.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.569
EVEN MY CLIENT.
YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A CASE.

22:16.603 --> 22:17.970
YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
ON THE MURDER--

22:18.004 --> 22:19.572
- I'VE GOT THE THREE MEN
HE ASSAULTED.

22:19.606 --> 22:20.873
MURPHY, ARMSTRONG,

22:20.907 --> 22:22.509
AND JACKSON IS BACK
FROM HIS CRUISE.

22:22.542 --> 22:24.411
- THOSE CLOSET CASES
THINK I ATTACKED THEM?

22:24.444 --> 22:27.814
WHAT'D I DO, KIDNAP THEM?
- OKAY. OKAY. CAN IT, JEREMY.

22:27.847 --> 22:30.917
BUT AS HE'S SAYING,
YOUR THREE SO-CALLED VICTIMS

22:30.950 --> 22:32.719
ALL WENT TO HOTELS
WITH MR. JONES

22:32.752 --> 22:34.421
AT THEIR OWN SUGGESTION.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.055
I'LL FIND A DOZEN OTHER MEN
THEY HAD SEX WITH

22:36.088 --> 22:39.025
AND HALF A DOZEN
WHO TIED THEM UP JUST FOR FUN.

22:39.058 --> 22:40.893
I'LL TAKE THREE COUNTS
OF MISDEMEANOR ASSAULT

22:40.927 --> 22:44.030
AND YOU SHOULD THANK ME.

22:47.467 --> 22:48.768
- YOU'VE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME.

22:48.801 --> 22:50.570
YOU'RE DROPPING
THE MURDER CHARGE?

22:50.603 --> 22:53.105
- MY BEST EVIDENCE IS
WHAT JONES'S HUSBAND TOLD YOU,

22:53.139 --> 22:54.974
AND WE CAN'T USE IT.

22:55.007 --> 22:56.876
- BUT YOU STILL
HAVE THE ASSAULTS.

22:56.909 --> 22:59.045
- IFFY.

22:59.078 --> 23:00.413
I'LL PILE THE CHARGES ON.

23:00.447 --> 23:02.014
RAPE, ROBBERY,
UNLAWFUL IMPRISONMENT.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.950
BUT HE DIDN'T
PREY ON ALTAR BOYS.

23:03.983 --> 23:06.052
THE JURY IS GOING TO THINK
THOSE MEN WERE ASKING FOR IT.

23:06.085 --> 23:08.054
- ONLY THING WORSE
THAN HE-SAID, SHE-SAID

23:08.087 --> 23:09.522
IS HE-SAID, HE-SAID.

23:09.556 --> 23:11.123
- HOLD ON.

23:11.157 --> 23:13.593
YOU CAN'T USE MASON'S TESTIMONY
IN COURT, RIGHT?

23:13.626 --> 23:15.428
BUT YOU CAN USE IT
TO INVESTIGATE.

23:15.462 --> 23:16.896
- THAT'S LEGAL.

23:16.929 --> 23:18.631
- MASON SAID THAT JONES
WAS SOME KIND OF GIGOLO

23:18.665 --> 23:19.966
AND THAT WOMEN
GAVE HIM GIFTS.

23:19.999 --> 23:21.801
NOW, DOES ANYBODY
BELIEVE THAT?

23:21.834 --> 23:24.003
- GIFTS? THIS GUY WOULD STEAL
ACORNS FROM A BLIND SQUIRREL.

23:24.036 --> 23:25.905
- THANK YOU.

23:25.938 --> 23:27.039
- WE'RE WORRIED THAT
ALL THE JURY WILL SEE HERE

23:27.073 --> 23:28.475
IS GAY SEX GAMES.

23:28.508 --> 23:32.645
UH, FIND ME
SOME FEMALE VICTIMS.

23:32.679 --> 23:36.549
- BACK TO HUNK NIGHT.

23:36.583 --> 23:38.017
[women cheering]

23:38.050 --> 23:40.620
- FIREMEN ARE
MORE POPULAR THAN COPS?

23:40.653 --> 23:42.889
- OH, YEAH!
YEAH, THESE WOMEN GO NUTS.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.090
I NEED MORE SECURITY
FOR THE BOY DANCERS

23:44.123 --> 23:45.958
THAN THE GIRL DANCERS.

23:45.992 --> 23:48.928
BACHELORETTE PARTIES,
I CALL IN THE NATIONAL GUARD.

23:48.961 --> 23:50.863
- OKAY, OUR FRIEND JONES.

23:50.897 --> 23:52.899
HE HAVE ANY LADIES
GOING NUTS OVER HIM?

23:52.932 --> 23:54.767
- YEAH, SURE,
IF THEY WERE DRUNK ENOUGH.

23:54.801 --> 23:56.636
- DOES HE EVER
TAKE ANY OF THEM HOME?

23:56.669 --> 23:59.739
- JONES? HE'S AS GAY
AS A HERD OF UNICORNS.

23:59.772 --> 24:01.040
- WHAT IF MONEY
WAS INVOLVED?

24:01.073 --> 24:03.142
- LET ME TELL YOU
A LITTLE STORY.

24:03.175 --> 24:05.144
ONE NIGHT, I SAW THIS LADY
WAITING FOR HIM OUTSIDE.

24:05.177 --> 24:07.914
SHE PRACTICALLY BEGGED HIM
TO TAKE HER HOME.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.081
HE JUST PUT HER
IN A CAB.

24:09.115 --> 24:10.550
SHE WAS SO SMASHED,
SHE LEFT HER PURSE

24:10.583 --> 24:11.784
SITTING ON THE SIDEWALK.

24:11.818 --> 24:13.052
- WHAT, HE TOOK IT OR WHAT?

24:13.085 --> 24:14.086
- NO, HE HANDED IT
TO THE BOUNCER

24:14.120 --> 24:15.555
LIKE IT HAD FEMALE COOTIES.

24:15.588 --> 24:18.691
- THANK YOU, MAN.

24:24.797 --> 24:27.099
AMANDA?

24:31.103 --> 24:33.973
- HELLO.
- [chuckles]

24:34.006 --> 24:36.909
HOW DID YOU FIND ME?
- WELL, I'M A TRAINED DETECTIVE.

24:36.943 --> 24:39.078
PLUS I COULD SMELL THE SCOTCH.

24:39.111 --> 24:41.280
NO LUCK ON THE FEMALE VICTIMS.
- MM-HM.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.149
- WE TRACKED DOWN
A WOMAN WHO BASICALLY

24:43.182 --> 24:47.920
INVITED JONES TO STEAL FROM HER,
AND HE DECLINED.

24:47.954 --> 24:50.790
- YOU SAY THAT
LIKE IT'S BAD NEWS.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.892
- UH, YOU WERE LOOKING
FOR OTHER CHARGES

24:52.925 --> 24:54.193
TO BUMP UP THE SENTENCE,
REMEMBER?

24:54.226 --> 24:55.995
- MM-HM. I THINK YOU
JUST BROUGHT ME ONE.

24:56.028 --> 25:00.867
[tapping]
SIT. DRINK. SMILE.

25:03.102 --> 25:05.004
- CABERNET, PLEASE.

25:05.037 --> 25:06.839
WHY?

25:06.873 --> 25:08.641
- JONES WALKED AWAY FROM
A WOMAN HE COULD HAVE ROBBED.

25:08.675 --> 25:10.042
- YEAH.

25:10.076 --> 25:11.544
- THAT MEANS HE ONLY
GOES AFTER GAY MEN.

25:11.578 --> 25:12.979
- WE KIND OF FIGURED THAT,
DIDN'T WE?

25:13.012 --> 25:14.981
- YEAH, BUT NOW WE KNOW IT.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.849
NOW WE CAN PROVE IT.

25:16.883 --> 25:18.284
THAT MAKES EVERYTHING
HE'S DONE A HATE CRIME.

25:18.317 --> 25:19.586
- WHAT?

25:19.619 --> 25:20.853
- I USE THE HATE CRIME
STATUTE,

25:20.887 --> 25:22.321
ALL THE PENALTIES
GET BUMPED UP.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.323
I CAN PUT JONES AWAY
FOR EXTRA YEARS.

25:24.356 --> 25:25.892
- YOU'RE GONNA ARGUE
THAT A GAY MAN

25:25.925 --> 25:29.061
MARRIED TO ANOTHER GAY MAN
HATES GAYS?

25:29.095 --> 25:32.699
- WATCH ME.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.575
- THE PEOPLE WILL SHOW THAT
THE DEFENDANT NOT ONLY COMMITTED

25:42.609 --> 25:44.977
BRUTAL PHYSICAL ASSAULTS
AGAINST THREE INDIVIDUALS,

25:45.011 --> 25:49.616
BUT IN DOING SO, COMMITTED
A SECOND CRIME AGAINST A GROUP.

25:49.649 --> 25:53.920
A GROUP THAT HAS LONG
SUFFERED PERSECUTION AND HATRED.

25:53.953 --> 25:57.089
THE DEFENDANT
IS HIMSELF A HOMOSEXUAL,

25:57.123 --> 26:01.093
SO IT MAY SEEM COUNTERINTUITIVE
THAT HE HATES GAYS.

26:01.127 --> 26:06.899
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN JEWS
IN THE AMERICAN NAZI PARTY.

26:06.933 --> 26:08.300
THERE HAVE BEEN
DARK-SKINNED BLACKS

26:08.334 --> 26:12.204
WHO REVILED THEIR
LIGHTER-SKINNED COUSINS.

26:12.238 --> 26:15.141
I CAN'T SAY
WHY THE ACCUSED

26:15.174 --> 26:17.376
CHOSE TO TARGET MEN

26:17.409 --> 26:20.680
WHO SHARE HIS
SEXUAL ORIENTATION,

26:20.713 --> 26:24.050
BUT HE DID,

26:24.083 --> 26:26.385
AND THAT IS ALL YOU NEED
TO KNOW TO CONVICT HIM

26:26.418 --> 26:29.722
OF HIS CRIMES.

26:35.928 --> 26:39.732
- WHAT AM I THINKING
RIGHT NOW?

26:39.766 --> 26:41.367
THAT I WISH I'D HAD
A SECOND CUP OF COFFEE

26:41.400 --> 26:43.670
BEFORE COURT THIS MORNING,

26:43.703 --> 26:46.739
OR THAT MR. BARBA'S
PROSECUTION IS SO WRONG

26:46.773 --> 26:48.741
THAT HE SHOULD
BE TAKEN OUT AND SHOT?

26:52.912 --> 26:54.747
YOU CAN'T TELL, CAN YOU?

26:54.781 --> 26:56.716
AND WHAT DOES IT MATTER?

26:56.749 --> 26:57.950
DO I DESERVE TO BE PUNISHED
FOR SOMETHING

26:57.984 --> 26:59.752
THAT'S ONLY
INSIDE MY HEAD?

26:59.786 --> 27:01.320
- OBJECTION.
MS. EFRON IS ARGUING THE WISDOM

27:01.353 --> 27:03.222
OF THE LAW AND NOT
MAKING AN OPENING STATEMENT.

27:03.255 --> 27:06.158
- MS. EFRON, WATCH YOURSELF.
- I'M SORRY, YOUR HONOR.

27:06.192 --> 27:08.227
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

27:11.163 --> 27:16.769
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU
THAT JEREMY JONES IS AN ANGEL,

27:16.803 --> 27:20.072
BUT HE IS NOT GUILTY OF
THE CRIMES HE IS CHARGED WITH.

27:20.106 --> 27:23.209
NEITHER THOSE
AGAINST INDIVIDUALS,

27:23.242 --> 27:25.144
NOR THE SUPPOSEDLY
WORSE CRIME

27:25.177 --> 27:28.247
OF THINKING BAD THOUGHTS.

27:32.985 --> 27:36.889
- MR. MURPHY, WHERE
DID YOU MEET THE DEFENDANT?

27:36.923 --> 27:41.393
- AT A BAR
CALLED NEW YORK JUNK.

27:41.427 --> 27:44.864
- WHAT KIND OF BAR
IS THAT?

27:44.897 --> 27:47.066
- IT'S A GAY BAR.

27:47.099 --> 27:49.435
- WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE?

27:49.468 --> 27:53.439
- I WAS LOOKING
FOR COMPANIONSHIP

27:53.472 --> 27:55.241
FOR THE EVENING.

27:55.274 --> 27:57.810
- WHAT KIND
OF COMPANIONSHIP?

27:57.844 --> 28:00.246
- SEXUAL COMPANIONSHIP.

28:00.279 --> 28:03.783
- DID THE DEFENDANT
APPROACH YOU, MR. ARMSTRONG,

28:03.816 --> 28:06.218
OR DID YOU APPROACH HIM?

28:06.252 --> 28:07.954
- HE APPROACHED ME.

28:07.987 --> 28:10.056
- AND WHAT HAPPENED THEN?

28:10.089 --> 28:13.425
- WE TALKED FOR A WHILE,
THEN DECIDED TO GO TO A HOTEL.

28:13.459 --> 28:15.762
- AND WHAT HAPPENED THERE?

28:15.795 --> 28:20.066
- WE BEGAN TO HAVE RELATIONS.

28:20.099 --> 28:22.034
- AND WERE YOU WILLING,
MR. JACKSON?

28:22.068 --> 28:23.302
- AT FIRST.

28:23.335 --> 28:25.104
- BUT ONLY AT FIRST?
- YES.

28:25.137 --> 28:27.106
HE WANTED ME TO DO THINGS
I WASN'T COMFORTABLE WITH.

28:27.139 --> 28:31.477
- DID YOU OBJECT?
- YES. VERY MUCH.

28:31.510 --> 28:33.846
I TRIED TO LEAVE.
- AND WHY DIDN'T YOU?

28:33.880 --> 28:37.016
- HE HAD TIED ME DOWN.
I COULDN'T EVEN MOVE.

28:37.049 --> 28:38.818
- HE TIED ME TO THE BED.

28:38.851 --> 28:41.453
FORCED HIMSELF INTO ME.

28:41.487 --> 28:43.389
HE WAS CALLING ME NAMES,
BEATING ME.

28:43.422 --> 28:45.825
- HE WAS VICIOUS.
OUT OF CONTROL.

28:45.858 --> 28:47.994
- THE MORE IT HURT ME,
THE HAPPIER HE WAS.

28:48.027 --> 28:50.362
- HE LEFT ME TIED UP.
HE TOOK MY WALLET.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.899
- AND HE KEPT SAYING,
"HOW DOES IT FEEL TO...

28:52.932 --> 28:54.767
BE THE FAG?"

29:02.909 --> 29:05.377
- THAT WAS BRAVE.
- YEAH. REALLY.

29:05.411 --> 29:06.445
NOW THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWS.

29:06.478 --> 29:07.980
- MELISSA.
- DON'T.

29:08.014 --> 29:09.381
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
IT WAS LIKE FOR ME

29:09.415 --> 29:11.217
SITTING IN THERE
LISTENING TO THAT?

29:11.250 --> 29:13.219
- MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE COME.
- OH, THAT WOULD BE PERFECT.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.354
SO THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWS,
BUT I DON'T.

29:15.387 --> 29:17.824
JUST LIKE BEFORE, RIGHT?

29:17.857 --> 29:20.492
- 16 YEARS.
- MR. MURPHY--

29:20.526 --> 29:23.896
- DON'T EVEN TRY.

29:27.867 --> 29:29.335
- I'M A GAY MAN.

29:29.368 --> 29:31.170
I LIKE TO GO OUT
AND I LIKE TO MEET PEOPLE.

29:31.203 --> 29:34.240
- YOU LIKE TO MEET
PEOPLE FOR SEX.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.843
- I ENJOY SEX.
IT MAKES ME FEEL ALIVE.

29:36.876 --> 29:38.410
I NEVER DO IT
TO HURT ANYONE.

29:38.444 --> 29:39.912
- JEREMY, THAT'S NOT
WHAT WE'RE HEARING

29:39.946 --> 29:42.048
FROM THE WITNESSES
AGAINST YOU.

29:42.081 --> 29:44.450
- I KNOW. BUT CHARLES
AND CURTIS AND ETHAN--

29:44.483 --> 29:47.286
WHEN THEY MET ME, THEY WANTED
TO SPEND TIME WITH ME.

29:47.319 --> 29:48.587
- THEY TRIED
TO PICK YOU UP?

29:48.620 --> 29:50.289
- YES.

29:50.322 --> 29:52.324
AND THEY'RE ALL
IN THE CLOSET, I GUESS,

29:52.358 --> 29:53.893
AND NOW THEY'RE EMBARRASSED,

29:53.926 --> 29:55.027
AND I THINK
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE LYING.

29:55.061 --> 29:56.462
- MOVE TO STRIKE.

29:56.495 --> 29:58.130
WE'RE NOT HERE TO LISTEN
TO THE DEFENDANT'S

29:58.164 --> 29:59.398
PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORIES.

29:59.431 --> 30:01.567
- SUSTAINED.
THE JURY WILL DISREGARD.

30:01.600 --> 30:04.503
- JEREMY, DID YOU FORCE
ANY OF THOSE MEN

30:04.536 --> 30:07.139
TO DO ANYTHING
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO DO?

30:07.173 --> 30:09.308
- NO. THEY CAME ON TO ME.

30:09.341 --> 30:11.543
THEY SUGGESTED
GOING TO HOTELS.

30:11.577 --> 30:13.145
CHARLES STARTED
BUYING ME DRINKS.

30:13.179 --> 30:15.581
HE TOLD ME
I HAD BEAUTIFUL EYES.

30:15.614 --> 30:17.483
HE WAS REALLY NICE.

30:17.516 --> 30:20.519
- WELL, SOME
OF YOUR ACTIVITIES--

30:20.552 --> 30:22.889
[sighs]
THE SEXUAL ONES,

30:22.922 --> 30:25.491
ARE A LITTLE UNCONVENTIONAL.

30:25.524 --> 30:27.226
- SEX GAMES.

30:27.259 --> 30:29.595
MEN LIKE THAT--
WHEN THEY LET LOOSE,

30:29.628 --> 30:31.597
THEY CAN GET
A LITTLE KINKY.

30:31.630 --> 30:34.233
THEY'VE VERY BOTTLED UP.

30:34.266 --> 30:35.434
I WAS EVEN SURPRISED
BY SOME OF THE THINGS

30:35.467 --> 30:36.502
THAT THEY WANTED.

30:36.535 --> 30:38.204
- THE THINGS
THEY SAY YOU TOOK?

30:38.237 --> 30:39.505
- GIFTS.

30:39.538 --> 30:41.874
I'M UNEMPLOYED
AND THEY'RE ALL RICH.

30:41.908 --> 30:43.242
I WAS EMBARRASSED
TO TAKE ANYTHING,

30:43.275 --> 30:45.144
BUT I COULDN'T
AFFORD TO SAY NO.

30:45.177 --> 30:47.546
I ONLY WISH THAT I HAD.

30:47.579 --> 30:51.951
- THANK YOU.

30:51.984 --> 30:53.552
OH, ONE MORE THING.

30:53.585 --> 30:56.622
JEREMY, DO YOU HATE GAYS?

30:56.655 --> 30:58.958
- [chuckles]
OF COURSE NOT.

30:58.991 --> 31:01.427
THAT'S WHO I AM.

31:01.460 --> 31:04.596
- RIGHT.

31:07.599 --> 31:12.071
- SO, MR. JONES,
YOU DON'T HATE GAYS?

31:12.104 --> 31:13.072
- OF COURSE NOT.

31:13.105 --> 31:14.306
- BUT YOUR GAY SEX PARTNERS

31:14.340 --> 31:16.575
GET TIED UP,
BEATEN, AND ROBBED?

31:16.608 --> 31:18.144
- OBJECTION.

31:18.177 --> 31:19.645
WHAT'S THE QUESTION?

31:19.678 --> 31:21.547
- SUSTAINED.

31:21.580 --> 31:25.417
- YOUR SEXUAL BEHAVIOR DOES
INCLUDE VIOLENCE, DOESN'T IT?

31:25.451 --> 31:27.119
- NO.

31:27.153 --> 31:28.320
WHEN I'M WITH MY HUSBAND,
WE TAKE THINGS EASY.

31:28.354 --> 31:29.621
SLOW AND EASY.

31:29.655 --> 31:32.691
- BUT WHEN YOU CRUISE,
YOU ONLY FIND PARTNERS

31:32.724 --> 31:36.295
WHO LIKE THINGS
HARD AND FAST.

31:36.328 --> 31:37.529
WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

31:37.563 --> 31:38.630
- WELL, IT'S LIKE I SAID.

31:38.664 --> 31:41.500
MEN LIKE THAT,
THEY LIKE TO PLAY ROUGH.

31:41.533 --> 31:44.470
- "MEN LIKE THAT."

31:44.503 --> 31:47.039
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

31:47.073 --> 31:50.509
- YOU SAW THEM.
THEY'RE TRYING TO LOOK STRAIGHT.

31:50.542 --> 31:52.511
- YOU HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH THAT?

31:52.544 --> 31:56.615
- ONLY THAT IT'S NOT HONEST.
LOOK, I DON'T HIDE WHAT I AM.

31:56.648 --> 31:59.485
I'M GLAD THAT I'M GAY.
I'M PROUD TO BE GAY.

31:59.518 --> 32:01.287
- AS MUCH AS TIMES HAVE CHANGED,

32:01.320 --> 32:03.489
IT STILL TAKES COURAGE
TO COME OUT, DOESN'T IT?

32:03.522 --> 32:05.057
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT.

32:05.091 --> 32:08.394
- SO THOSE MEN,
THEY'RE GAY WHEN IT'S FUN,

32:08.427 --> 32:11.130
AND THEN THEY GO BACK
AND HIDE IN THE CLOSET.

32:11.163 --> 32:13.565
DOES THAT SEEM FAIR TO YOU?
- DOES IT SEEM FAIR TO YOU?

32:13.599 --> 32:15.334
- HM.

32:15.367 --> 32:17.703
DO YOU EVER THINK YOUR LIFE
WOULD BE EASIER

32:17.736 --> 32:19.571
IF YOU COULD
PASS FOR STRAIGHT?

32:19.605 --> 32:22.341
- WELL, I WOULDN'T WANT TO.
I AM WHAT I AM.

32:22.374 --> 32:27.113
- BUT THOSE MEN--THE ONES
WHO CAN PASS FOR STRAIGHT.

32:27.146 --> 32:29.581
THE ONES
WHO AREN'T EFFEMINATE.

32:29.615 --> 32:32.084
YOU FIND THEM ATTRACTIVE,
DON'T YOU?

32:32.118 --> 32:33.585
- NO. NOT ESPECIALLY.

32:33.619 --> 32:35.554
- THEY'RE THE ONES YOU SERVICE,
AREN'T THEY?

32:35.587 --> 32:37.656
- NO. NO, I DON'T.
- YOU TAKE THEM TO HOTELS.

32:37.689 --> 32:39.658
WHAT DO THEY ASK YOU TO DO
ONCE YOU GET THERE?

32:39.691 --> 32:41.360
- THAT DOESN'T MATTER.
- WHY NOT?

32:41.393 --> 32:42.728
BECAUSE YOU TAKE CHARGE?
- [chuckles]

32:42.761 --> 32:45.297
OKAY, I DON'T GET DOWN
ON MY KNEES FOR THEM,

32:45.331 --> 32:46.598
IF THAT'S WHAT--

32:46.632 --> 32:47.666
- IS THAT WHAT
THEY ASK YOU TO DO?

32:47.699 --> 32:49.268
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.
- WHY?

32:49.301 --> 32:50.469
THEY'RE THE ONES
WHO ARE SUCCESSFUL.

32:50.502 --> 32:51.537
THEY'RE THE ONES
WITH THE MONEY.

32:51.570 --> 32:53.305
THE ONES WHO
MOVE BETWEEN WORLDS.

32:53.339 --> 32:54.406
- YEAH, IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO IMPRESS ME OR SOMETHING?

32:54.440 --> 32:55.441
- I DON'T KNOW, YOU TELL ME.

32:55.474 --> 32:56.575
CONSIDERING YOU'RE--WHAT?

32:56.608 --> 32:59.678
A PART-TIME UNEMPLOYED
MALE STRIPPER.

32:59.711 --> 33:01.680
WHAT DO THEY SAY TO YOU?
WHAT DO THEY ASK YOU TO DO?

33:01.713 --> 33:04.016
- IT DOESN'T MATTER!

33:09.088 --> 33:12.691
OKAY, YOU KNOW,
THEY MAY HAVE THEIR FAKE WIVES

33:12.724 --> 33:16.395
AND THEIR SHOW-KIDS
AND FAMILY CHRISTMAS CARDS.

33:16.428 --> 33:19.298
YOU KNOW, BUYING THE "WIFEY"
ANNIVERSARY PRESENTS.

33:19.331 --> 33:22.034
WHEN THEY'RE WITH ME,
THEIR LIVES--

33:22.068 --> 33:23.569
THEIR LIVES ARE LIES!

33:23.602 --> 33:27.473
THE LIES ARE OVER!

33:27.506 --> 33:31.143
I AM JUST AS MUCH
A MAN AS THEY ARE.

33:31.177 --> 33:34.213
MORE.

33:45.091 --> 33:47.659
- YOUR HONOR,
COULD WE SPEAK IN CHAMBERS?

33:59.771 --> 34:01.207
- WE ALL JUST HEARD
MR. BARBA DISPROVE HIS CASE.

34:01.240 --> 34:02.308
- EXCUSE ME?

34:02.341 --> 34:04.710
- YOU GOT JONES
TO LET HIS GUARD DOWN.

34:04.743 --> 34:06.412
IT WAS BRILLIANT.

34:06.445 --> 34:08.480
YOU GOT HIM TO REALLY
TELL YOU HOW HE FEELS.

34:08.514 --> 34:10.349
- EXACTLY.

34:10.382 --> 34:11.750
HE HATES THE PEOPLE HE ATTACKED
BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE.

34:11.783 --> 34:13.719
HE BASICALLY CONFESSED
TO COMMITTING A HATE CRIME.

34:13.752 --> 34:15.321
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I HEARD.

34:15.354 --> 34:17.556
I HEARD A CLEAR DISPLAY
OF ANIMUS,

34:17.589 --> 34:20.292
NOT AGAINST GAY MEN,
BUT AGAINST A SUBSET--

34:20.326 --> 34:23.262
CLOSETED GAY MEN
WHO CAN PASS AS STRAIGHT.

34:23.295 --> 34:25.831
- A DISTINCTION
WITHOUT A DIFFERENCE.

34:25.864 --> 34:27.566
- OOH, IT'S
A CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE.

34:27.599 --> 34:29.401
IF I GO OUT AND BEAT UP JEWS,
THAT'S A HATE CRIME.

34:29.435 --> 34:32.338
IF I BEAT UP LEFT-HANDED JEWS,
THAT'S ASSAULT.

34:32.371 --> 34:34.740
I MOVE FOR DISMISSAL
OF THE HATE CRIME CHARGE.

34:34.773 --> 34:36.175
- SHE'S SPLITTING HAIRS
THAT COULDN'T BE SEEN

34:36.208 --> 34:37.409
WITH AN ELECTRON MICROSCOPE.

34:37.443 --> 34:38.877
- I'M NOT SO SURE,
MR. BARBA.

34:38.910 --> 34:40.846
IT DOES SEEM LIKE
A BIT OF AN OVERREACH.

34:40.879 --> 34:43.249
- THE STATUTE IS CLEAR.

34:43.282 --> 34:45.484
- BUT YOUR CASE ISN'T.

34:45.517 --> 34:47.153
I KNOW THAT YOU BOTH AGREE

34:47.186 --> 34:49.388
HOW IMPORTANT
THE HATE CRIME STATUTE IS.

34:49.421 --> 34:51.623
IT WOULD REALLY PAIN ME
TO SEE IT TRIVIALIZED

34:51.657 --> 34:53.759
BY INDISCRIMINATE USE.

34:53.792 --> 34:55.561
- ALL DUE RESPECT,
ISN'T IT UP TO THE JURY

34:55.594 --> 34:57.329
TO DECIDE IF IT APPLIES?

34:57.363 --> 35:01.433
- HOLD ON, DENNIS.

35:01.467 --> 35:04.670
THE JURY DECIDES THE FACTS--
HMM?

35:04.703 --> 35:09.441
AND THE JUDGE CAN SET ASIDE
A VERDICT AS A MATTER OF LAW.

35:09.475 --> 35:13.445
AND THAT NEVER LOOKS GOOD
FOR A PROSECUTOR, DOES IT?

35:18.517 --> 35:20.386
- JUDGE GAVE ME A CHOICE.

35:20.419 --> 35:22.188
DROP THE HATE CRIME CHARGES
OR SHE'D DO IT FOR ME.

35:22.221 --> 35:23.489
- WE ALWAYS KNEW
THAT WAS A STRETCH.

35:23.522 --> 35:24.823
- BUT THE RAPES,
THE ROBBERIES.

35:24.856 --> 35:26.558
I MEAN, THOSE LOOK
PRETTY DAMN CLEAR.

35:26.592 --> 35:28.260
- MAYBE TO YOU.

35:28.294 --> 35:30.362
THE JURY'S BEEN
DELIBERATING FOR THREE DAYS.

35:30.396 --> 35:32.398
AND THEY KEEP POPPING OUT
TO SAY THAT THEY'RE DEADLOCKED.

35:32.431 --> 35:36.368
[cell phone buzzes]
AH. HERE THEY COME AGAIN.

35:42.774 --> 35:44.910
- STILL NO PROGRESS,
YOUR HONOR,

35:44.943 --> 35:47.446
AND THINGS ARE GETTING
A LITTLE ANTAGONISTIC

35:47.479 --> 35:48.880
IN THE JURY ROOM.

35:48.914 --> 35:51.517
NONE OF US FEEL THERE'S
ANY POINT IN CONTINUING.

35:51.550 --> 35:53.452
- ARE THERE ANY CHARGES
IN WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE

35:53.485 --> 35:54.820
TO AGREE?

35:54.853 --> 35:57.223
- YES. ON THE COUNTS
OF UNLAWFUL IMPRISONMENT,

35:57.256 --> 35:58.724
WE FIND THE DEFENDANT GUILTY.

35:58.757 --> 36:00.326
- VERY WELL.

36:00.359 --> 36:02.794
- ON THE OTHER CHARGES,
I DECLARE A MISTRIAL.

36:02.828 --> 36:05.331
A DATE FOR SENTENCING
WILL BE SET ON THE CONVICTIONS.

36:05.364 --> 36:08.334
- YOUR HONOR,
I REQUEST A HEARING ON BAIL,

36:08.367 --> 36:09.735
PENDING SENTENCING,
SINCE THE ONLY CONVICTIONS

36:09.768 --> 36:12.738
ARE RELATIVELY MINOR,
REMOVING ANY INCENTIVE TO FLEE.

36:12.771 --> 36:15.841
- SO ORDERED.

36:24.916 --> 36:27.619
- YOU WANT ME
TO TESTIFY AGAIN?

36:27.653 --> 36:31.623
- FOR UNLAWFUL IMPRISONMENT,
JONES WILL GET A YEAR AT MOST.

36:31.657 --> 36:33.425
I CAN RETRY HIM
ON THE ROBBERIES AND RAPES

36:33.459 --> 36:34.960
AND WE STAND
A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE IF YOU--

36:34.993 --> 36:36.628
- NO.

36:36.662 --> 36:38.264
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE OTHER GUYS ARE GONNA DO,

36:38.297 --> 36:39.331
BUT I'M NOT
TESTIFYING AGAIN.

36:39.365 --> 36:40.599
- I KNOW THIS
HAS BEEN DIFFICULT--

36:40.632 --> 36:42.434
- DIFFICULT?

36:42.468 --> 36:44.370
I'M LIVING IN A HOTEL.

36:44.403 --> 36:46.938
MY 12-YEAR-OLD SON
IS GETTING BULLIED IN SCHOOL.

36:46.972 --> 36:48.540
THE YOUNGER KIDS,
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

36:48.574 --> 36:52.244
THEY JUST--THEY JUST
SEE THEIR MOTHER CRYING.

36:52.278 --> 36:56.315
- MR. MURPHY,
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.

36:56.348 --> 36:58.750
- FOR WHO?
FOR WHAT?

36:58.784 --> 37:00.419
- JEREMY JONES
IS A MURDERER.

37:00.452 --> 37:03.789
- WELL, THEN WHY DON'T YOU
GET HIM FOR MURDER?

37:07.859 --> 37:09.495
[door closes]

37:09.528 --> 37:11.297
- NOT AN ENTIRELY
UNREASONABLE QUESTION.

37:11.330 --> 37:12.898
- HE'S RIGHT.
LET'S GET HIM FOR MURDER.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.566
- THAT WOULD BE DELIGHTFUL.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.468
HAVE YOU CONJURED UP
SOME EVIDENCE?

37:16.502 --> 37:19.538
- WE KNOW THAT JONES
STOLE FROM HIS VICTIMS

37:19.571 --> 37:22.040
AND HE GAVE SOME
OF WHAT HE GOT TO HIS HUSBAND,

37:22.073 --> 37:23.342
LIKE THE WATCH
THAT MASON WAS WEARING.

37:23.375 --> 37:24.676
- YOU CHECKED THAT OUT.

37:24.710 --> 37:25.944
IT DIDN'T BELONG
TO ANY KNOWN VICTIM.

37:25.977 --> 37:27.546
- SLOW DOWN, COUNSELOR.

37:27.579 --> 37:29.648
ON THE STAND, JONES
TALKED ABOUT THE MEN HE HATES

37:29.681 --> 37:33.719
BUYING ANNIVERSARY GIFTS
FOR THEIR FAKE WIVES.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.954
IT'S A FUNNY IDEA
TO POP INTO HIS HEAD.

37:35.987 --> 37:39.525
- LAUREL DUNLEAVY TOLD US
THAT HER HUSBAND DIED

37:39.558 --> 37:42.294
A FEW DAYS
BEFORE THEIR ANNIVERSARY.

37:42.328 --> 37:45.431
- SO IF HE BOUGHT HER SOMETHING
AND HE HAD IT WITH HIM

37:45.464 --> 37:46.665
WHEN JONES KILLED HIM--

37:46.698 --> 37:48.033
- JONES TOOK IT.

37:48.066 --> 37:49.735
THERE WAS NOTHING
IN THAT HOTEL ROOM.

37:49.768 --> 37:53.505
AND THAT SHOULD TIE HIM
TO THE MURDER VICTIM.

37:53.539 --> 37:54.906
- RUN DUNLEAVY'S
CREDIT CARDS.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.842
SEE IF HE DID ANY
ANNIVERSARY SHOPPING

37:56.875 --> 37:59.411
ON THE DAY
HE WAS KILLED.

37:59.445 --> 38:00.579
- I KNOW MY RIGHTS, OKAY?

38:00.612 --> 38:02.414
I DON'T HAVE
TO TALK TO ANY OF YOU.

38:02.448 --> 38:04.383
- THAT'S WHY WE APPRECIATE
YOUR VOLUNTARY COOPERATION.

38:04.416 --> 38:05.817
- YEAH, YOU SAID
IF I DIDN'T COME,

38:05.851 --> 38:07.319
YOU'D ARREST ME AGAIN.

38:07.353 --> 38:09.588
- I MISSPOKE.
YOUR WITNESS.

38:09.621 --> 38:13.492
- COME WITH US, MASON,
THIS WON'T TAKE LONG.

38:13.525 --> 38:15.394
- I DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS ANYMORE, OKAY?

38:15.427 --> 38:16.828
MY WHOLE LIFE
IS UPSIDE DOWN.

38:16.862 --> 38:18.530
- I JUST HAVE
ONE SIMPLE QUESTION.

38:18.564 --> 38:20.866
YOU TOLD US THAT JEREMY
GIVES YOU JEWELRY SOMETIMES,

38:20.899 --> 38:22.434
LIKE THE WATCH
THAT YOU SHOWED US.

38:22.468 --> 38:25.537
DID HE GIVE YOU
A PLATINUM BRACELET, TOO?

38:25.571 --> 38:26.905
- NO.

38:26.938 --> 38:28.574
- DID HE GIVE IT TO YOU
THE NIGHT DUNLEAVY WAS MURDERED?

38:28.607 --> 38:30.609
THE NIGHT YOU SAID
JEREMY CAME HOME ALL UPSET.

38:30.642 --> 38:33.445
- I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

38:33.479 --> 38:36.582
I CAN'T TESTIFY ANYWAY.
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT HE SAID.

38:36.615 --> 38:38.517
- BUT YOU CAN TELL US
WHERE THE BRACELET IS.

38:38.550 --> 38:40.051
- WHAT BRACELET?

38:40.085 --> 38:42.488
- LOOK, HERE'S
THE BILL OF SALE, ALL RIGHT?

38:42.521 --> 38:44.990
DUNLEAVY BOUGHT IT
FOR HIS WIFE THAT AFTERNOON,

38:45.023 --> 38:46.925
FOR THEIR ANNIVERSARY.

38:46.958 --> 38:49.428
NOW, HE DIDN'T TAKE IT HOME
AND IT WASN'T WITH HIS BODY.

38:49.461 --> 38:52.731
- AN I.D. BRACELET?
YOU SEE THOSE ANYWHERE.

38:52.764 --> 38:55.066
- YEAH, LOOK WHAT IT SAYS.
THIS ONE WAS ENGRAVED.

38:55.100 --> 38:56.668
"LOVE YOU MADLY."

39:04.743 --> 39:08.480
- THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.

39:08.514 --> 39:12.518
- WELL, IT'S RIGHT THERE, MASON.
IT'S BLACK AND WHITE.

39:14.119 --> 39:16.455
- HE TOLD YOU THAT HE BOUGHT IT
FOR YOU, DIDN'T HE?

39:18.424 --> 39:20.726
HE DIDN'T TELL YOU
THAT HE TOOK IT

39:20.759 --> 39:23.762
FROM A MAN THAT HE KILLED.

39:23.795 --> 39:27.566
THAT INSCRIPTION
WASN'T FOR YOU, MASON.

39:27.599 --> 39:29.535
IT WAS FOR
THAT MAN'S WIFE.

39:29.568 --> 39:32.738
- I WANT TO GO RIGHT NOW.

39:32.771 --> 39:34.573
- NOT YET.

39:38.644 --> 39:42.481
- MASON,
THIS IS MRS. DUNLEAVY,

39:42.514 --> 39:46.117
MR. DUNLEAVY'S WIDOW.

39:46.151 --> 39:49.655
- MRS. DUNLEAVY,
I'M SO SORRY.

39:52.458 --> 39:56.962
- YOUR HUSBAND
RAPED MY HUSBAND.

39:56.995 --> 40:01.132
IT'S SUCH AN ODD THING TO SAY,
ISN'T IT?

40:01.166 --> 40:06.104
THEY WERE CHEATING,
WEREN'T THEY?

40:06.137 --> 40:08.940
THEY WERE CHEATING ON US--

40:08.974 --> 40:11.176
YOU AND ME.

40:14.513 --> 40:17.015
BUT HE DIDN'T
HAVE TO KILL HIM.

40:20.886 --> 40:23.522
WHY DID HE KILL HIM?

40:31.229 --> 40:34.833
- WHERE'S THE BRACELET,
MASON?

40:42.574 --> 40:45.143
- I SUGGEST NOMINAL BAIL,
PENDING SENTENCING,

40:45.176 --> 40:47.145
OF, SAY, $5,000.

40:47.178 --> 40:50.181
- MR. BARBA?

40:50.215 --> 40:52.217
- FINE WITH ME, JUDGE.

40:52.250 --> 40:53.685
- REALLY?

40:53.719 --> 40:55.186
- IN THAT CASE,
BAIL IS SET AT 5,000,

40:55.220 --> 40:56.655
CASH OR BOND.

40:56.688 --> 40:58.990
[gavel pounds]

40:59.024 --> 41:01.493
- NO HARD FEELINGS, DETECTIVES.
I'LL SEE YOU ON EIGHTH AVENUE.

41:01.527 --> 41:04.496
- WELL, WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO POSTPONE THAT FOR A WHILE.

41:04.530 --> 41:06.264
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR MURDER, MR. JONES.

41:06.297 --> 41:08.667
- [chuckles]
SORE LOSERS, ARE WE?

41:08.700 --> 41:11.737
- THE BRACELET DUNLEAVY
BOUGHT THE DAY HE DIED.

41:13.939 --> 41:17.208
- HIS BLOOD.
YOUR FINGERPRINTS.

41:21.212 --> 41:23.782
- MASON, WHAT DID YOU DO?
- JEREMY, I'M SO SORRY.

41:23.815 --> 41:25.216
- YOU SCARED LITTLE FAGGOT!

41:25.250 --> 41:27.218
- ALL RIGHT, TAKE--JEREMY.
TAKE IT EASY, JEREMY.

41:27.252 --> 41:28.887
- TAKE IT EASY?
OH, I SEE.

41:28.920 --> 41:30.221
YOU'RE IN ON THIS TOO,
AREN'T YOU?

41:30.255 --> 41:32.223
YOU BACKSTABBING BITCH!
- WHAT?

41:32.257 --> 41:34.760
- YOU'RE MY LAWYER, NOT HIS.
YOU THINK YOU CAN SELL ME OUT?

41:34.793 --> 41:36.294
I WILL TAKE
YOU DOWN SO FAST--

41:36.327 --> 41:38.163
- HEY, HEY!
BACK UP, MR. JONES!

41:46.004 --> 41:48.273
- YOU OKAY, COUNSELOR?
- YEAH.

41:48.306 --> 41:51.076
YEAH, I'VE HAD WORSE.
RIGHT?

41:53.679 --> 41:56.181
YOU WERE WRONG ABOUT HIM.
HE DOESN'T JUST HATE GAYS.

41:56.214 --> 41:57.783
- HE HATES EVERYONE.

41:57.816 --> 42:00.819
- NO. HE HATES HIMSELF.
