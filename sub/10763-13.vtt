00:09.342 --> 00:11.745
You know, I heard
the most extraordinary thing

00:11.745 --> 00:13.246
on the radio today.

00:13.246 --> 00:14.235
I know!

00:14.748 --> 00:16.750
Rubinstein's torrid survey
of the Chopin mazurkas.

00:16.750 --> 00:19.252
It took all my strength
not to turn the car around,

00:19.252 --> 00:20.241
drive home and ravish my wife.

00:22.255 --> 00:24.746
That Daphne is one lucky lady.

00:25.258 --> 00:27.761
No, i was referring
to the fact

00:27.761 --> 00:30.764
that Maris has been
released on bail.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.755
Oh, yes.

00:33.266 --> 00:34.255
Of course, she's still under house arrest
until her murder trial.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.770
Poor thing, has to wear
an electronic tracking device

00:36.770 --> 00:38.271
on her ankle.

00:38.271 --> 00:39.773
And she can't keep
the press off her back.

00:39.773 --> 00:42.071
They're printing the most
vicious stories about her.

00:42.308 --> 00:43.410
i saw one of those.

00:43.410 --> 00:46.413
is it true that she fired
one of the gardeners

00:46.413 --> 00:49.405
because she found
a worm on the front walk?

00:50.116 --> 00:51.117
Well, to be fair,

00:51.117 --> 00:52.118
Maris has always
been frightened

00:52.118 --> 00:53.119
and disgusted by them.

00:53.119 --> 00:54.416
it's just a stupid worm.

00:55.121 --> 00:56.418
No, i'm talking about gardener
s.

00:58.124 --> 00:59.426
Hey, guys.
Oh, hey, Dad.

00:59.426 --> 01:00.427
Pull up a chair.

01:00.427 --> 01:02.128
Oh, thanks.
Looking sharp.

01:02.128 --> 01:03.430
i don't think i've
ever seen this jacket.

01:03.430 --> 01:05.131
That's because i don't
wear it too often.

01:05.131 --> 01:06.428
But you know,
sometimes when i do,

01:07.133 --> 01:09.135
i find all kinds
of junk in the pockets.

01:09.135 --> 01:11.433
it's like i'm putting on
a time capsule or something.

01:12.138 --> 01:13.139
Here..
.

01:13.139 --> 01:17.143
here's something from the worl
of yesterday.

01:17.143 --> 01:20.146
Dear God, Dad. That's
my home insurance payment.

01:20.146 --> 01:22.449
i asked you to mail this
three months ago.

01:22.449 --> 01:23.438
Oh, geez,
i'm sorry, Fras.

01:24.150 --> 01:25.151
But you see what i mean
about the jacket?

01:25.151 --> 01:28.450
i can still see him
giving me that envelope.

01:29.155 --> 01:30.457
No wonder my agent's
been calling me.

01:30.457 --> 01:31.446
My policy's
probably been canceled.

01:33.159 --> 01:36.162
Yes, Jim Sundquist,
please.

01:36.162 --> 01:37.459
Yeah, Jim, it's Frasier Crane.

01:38.164 --> 01:40.155
Yes, i know. i just
discovered that myself.

01:40.467 --> 01:42.458
Listen, how much to renew?

01:43.169 --> 01:43.870
What?

01:43.870 --> 01:47.173
Well, i'm going to have
to think that over.

01:47.173 --> 01:50.176
All right.
i'll call you.

01:50.176 --> 01:52.178
Thanks, Jim.

01:52.178 --> 01:53.179
Scandinavian shyster!

01:53.179 --> 01:55.482
Cold-hearted, glad-handed
highway robber.

01:55.482 --> 01:58.178
Phony big-toothed smiling
son-of-a-bitch insurance man.

02:00.186 --> 02:01.488
(faint yelling from phone)

02:01.488 --> 02:03.479
Not you, Jim.
Love to Marie.

02:06.493 --> 02:09.496
Damn, i'm going to have
to pay twice as much.

02:09.496 --> 02:11.197
Why don't you just find another insurer?

02:11.197 --> 02:12.494
Oh, you know who
you should talk to

02:13.199 --> 02:14.200
Ann Hodges.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.502
Oh, Roz,
have you lost your mind?

02:15.502 --> 02:17.203
i never want to see
that woman again.

02:17.203 --> 02:18.204
Who is she?

02:18.204 --> 02:19.506
Oh, it's a friend of Roz's.

02:19.506 --> 02:21.201
We had a stunningly bad date

02:21.508 --> 02:24.511
during which my behavior
was... Iess than chivalrous.

02:24.511 --> 02:26.206
You ate her ravioli.

02:26.513 --> 02:29.505
then hit on another woman
in the same restaurant

02:30.216 --> 02:33.419
Which i concede
was less than chivalrous.

02:33.419 --> 02:34.420
Well, the leas
t you could do

02:34.420 --> 02:35.409
is throw her
some business.

02:35.922 --> 02:37.924
She just did mine.
She did a great job.

02:37.924 --> 02:38.925
And she can rush t
his through for you.

02:38.925 --> 02:39.914
Here you go.
Here's her card.

02:40.426 --> 02:41.427
NiLES:
You should
be covered, Frasier.

02:41.427 --> 02:42.917
-
God forbid
something happens-

02:43.429 --> 02:45.932
a pipe bursts
or Dad screws up again?8?

02:45.932 --> 02:47.422
Remember the great bacon fire of '?

02:49.936 --> 02:52.939
i suppose spending ten minutes
with the woman won't kill me

02:52.939 --> 02:55.430
Oh, for God's sake, Jim,
hang up already.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.405
Well, this is me.

03:03.917 --> 03:06.920
Thanks again for holding
the elevator, Caroline.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.410
Well, you did throw
your briefcase into it.

03:08.922 --> 03:09.911
...
Yes, yes, well

03:10.290 --> 03:12.383
You'd be surprised how man
y people just kick it back out

03:12.892 --> 03:13.881
and then push
the "close" button.

03:14.394 --> 03:15.759
You know,

03:15.962 --> 03:17.263
maybe i could repay you

03:17.263 --> 03:19.265
by taking you to dinner
some evening.

03:19.265 --> 03:20.926
Yeah, i'd like that.
How about next Monday?

03:21.334 --> 03:22.235
Perfect.

03:22.235 --> 03:24.237
Why not stop by my place
first for a drink?

03:24.237 --> 03:25.738
Uh, around 6:00?

03:25.738 --> 03:27.228
Sounds good.
Great.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.709
Thanks again.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.244
And sorry
about the briefcase.

03:31.244 --> 03:34.213
.
You might want to put
some ice on that ankle

03:39.452 --> 03:40.419
Hi, Fras.
Hi, Dad.

03:40.787 --> 03:41.854
What have you got there?

03:41.854 --> 03:43.219
Oh, i made a sandwich

03:43.590 --> 03:45.251
from some of your
cold chicken in there.

03:45.291 --> 03:47.660
Also known as quail.

03:47.660 --> 03:50.220
Get a plate before you start
dripping mayonnaise all over.

03:50.430 --> 03:51.897
Oh, relax. i'm almost done.

03:52.398 --> 03:53.266
Oh, and by the way,

03:53.266 --> 03:56.269
until this home
is insured once again,

03:56.269 --> 03:59.761
there will be no more
barbecuing or deep-frying.

04:00.306 --> 04:01.568
Does that include the hot plate
in my bedroom?

04:01.841 --> 04:03.399
Since when do you have
a hot plate?
(doorbell ringing)

04:03.776 --> 04:05.368
Since i finally figured out
how to plug it in.

04:05.845 --> 04:07.313
,
in just one outlet

04:07.313 --> 04:09.882
i have my TV, aquarium,

04:09.882 --> 04:13.286
clock radio, and t
hat old space heater.

04:13.286 --> 04:14.776
.
Yes, well, unplug everything

04:16.289 --> 04:17.790
Hello, Frasier.

04:17.790 --> 04:20.726
Hello, Ann. Uh, please
, won't you come in.

04:20.726 --> 04:22.428
This is my father, Martin Crane.

04:22.428 --> 04:25.431
Oh, i've heard all about you.

04:25.431 --> 04:26.591
.
Frasier and i used to go out

04:27.000 --> 04:28.331
Oh.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.328
i'll be in my room.

04:33.573 --> 04:35.541
So, this is kind of weird, huh?

04:35.708 --> 04:38.278
Yes. i hope
that your being here

04:38.278 --> 04:40.269
means that you've
forgiven me?

04:40.647 --> 04:42.715
Well, i was pretty steamed
after that date,

04:42.715 --> 04:45.275
but my shrink helped me
work through the rage.

04:47.020 --> 04:50.290
Good thing you didn't walk i
n front of my car on the street.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.591
For the first few weeks there,

04:51.591 --> 04:54.287
i would have just gotten out
and given you a good kick.

04:54.594 --> 04:56.596
Well... and i would have
deserved one, too.

04:56.596 --> 04:58.598
Here, let me take
your coat.

04:58.598 --> 05:01.601
You're going to want to take
a look around the place

05:01.601 --> 05:03.303
before you write up
the policy.

05:03.303 --> 05:06.306
Oh, very nice!

05:06.306 --> 05:08.308
Thank you...
thank you very much.

05:08.308 --> 05:11.711
Hey, this guy looks like my ex.

05:11.711 --> 05:13.012
i'm just kidding.

05:13.012 --> 05:14.843
He wasn't black.

05:19.619 --> 05:21.849
Can i get you something
to drink?

05:22.088 --> 05:24.648
Just water, but i'll get it.
i want to see your kitchen.

05:26.859 --> 05:29.953
Wow, schmancy.

05:30.430 --> 05:31.488
And so clean.

05:31.698 --> 05:33.766
You know, there's a homosexual couple

05:33.766 --> 05:35.461
that livesin my building

05:35.768 --> 05:37.770
and their kitctyhen is like a pigs

05:37.770 --> 05:39.397
compared to yours.

05:41.741 --> 05:42.809
.
Whoops, spoke too soon

05:42.809 --> 05:44.504
.
Somebody dripped
a little bit of mayon...

05:44.811 --> 05:46.412
)
(screaming

05:46.412 --> 05:47.470
(loud crash)

05:52.652 --> 05:55.621
Ann?

05:56.956 --> 05:59.826
Boy, who'd have thunk
a little mayo on the floor

05:59.826 --> 06:01.521
could end up
breaking your leg?

06:02.929 --> 06:05.022
So, how's
that cast feeling?

06:05.498 --> 06:06.362
Okay.

06:06.766 --> 06:08.859
i'm worried about
my apartment, though.

06:09.535 --> 06:10.695
it's a fourth-floor walk-up.

06:11.104 --> 06:13.373
Oh, dear... well,
is there a friend

06:13.373 --> 06:15.364
or a family member
we could call

06:15.675 --> 06:16.903
to come and get you?

06:17.377 --> 06:20.446
No. Just my mom
and she lives in Portland.

06:20.446 --> 06:21.447
Uh-oh.

06:21.447 --> 06:22.749
"Uh-oh"?

06:22.749 --> 06:24.150
What's that
supposed to mean?

06:24.150 --> 06:27.420
if you screwed anything up,
i will sue you blue, buddy boy.

06:27.420 --> 06:29.581
DOCTOR:
No, no, it's nothing.

06:29.789 --> 06:30.857
The bulb burned out.

06:30.857 --> 06:31.858
Oh.

06:31.858 --> 06:34.554
.
Let's find you
a pair of crutches

06:35.728 --> 06:38.431
Watch it on the turns
there, Doc.

06:38.431 --> 06:39.728
Precious cargo.

06:43.436 --> 06:45.738
i hope you enjoyed
your sandwich.

06:45.738 --> 06:48.441
it may end up
costing me my apartment.

06:48.441 --> 06:50.432
you?
You think she'll sue

06:50.743 --> 06:52.445
Dad, she's
as insurance woman!

06:52.445 --> 06:53.746
if anybody knows anything

06:53.746 --> 06:55.611
about milking money
out of an injury, it's her.

06:55.948 --> 06:57.040
Won't your insurance cover it?

06:57.483 --> 06:58.484
i have no insurance!

06:58.484 --> 07:00.019
All right.

07:00.019 --> 07:01.008
But you know what?

07:01.487 --> 07:03.489
Why don't you just try
to get on her good side.

07:03.489 --> 07:04.979
Pay all her expenses,

07:05.491 --> 07:06.993
...
maybe throw in
a private nurse for a few days

07:06.993 --> 07:09.484
That's good. But she's
too dangerous to be left

07:09.996 --> 07:10.997
to her own thoughts
right now.

07:10.997 --> 07:12.999
We've got to try
the personal approach.

07:12.999 --> 07:14.500
i'll tell you what--

07:14.500 --> 07:16.502
Why don't we invite her
to spend a few days

07:16.502 --> 07:17.491
recuperating in our apartment?

07:18.004 --> 07:20.006
!
..
Oh..

07:20.006 --> 07:22.508
.
Friends do not sue friends

07:22.508 --> 07:27.002
Ooh, my pits
are barking already.

07:28.514 --> 07:31.017
Ann, listen,
Dad and i were just talking.

07:31.017 --> 07:34.020
We thought maybe you should
just stay at our place

07:34.020 --> 07:35.888
until you get used
to your crutches.

07:35.888 --> 07:37.150
Really?

07:37.523 --> 07:38.891
Sure. That's
what friends do.

07:38.891 --> 07:40.593
Thanks.

07:40.593 --> 07:41.894
Well, i'll call my super

07:41.894 --> 07:44.597
and have him send over
some clothes and my trumpet,

07:44.597 --> 07:46.155
and we're good to go.

07:47.500 --> 07:48.501
You play the trumpet?

07:48.501 --> 07:51.003
Oh, i just started.

07:51.003 --> 07:53.995
it's really hard.

08:01.848 --> 08:02.849
ANN:
Hey!

08:02.849 --> 08:04.550
MARTiN:
Oh, sorry!

08:04.550 --> 08:07.553
Damn it, Frasier, i just
walked in on your insurance lady

08:07.553 --> 08:08.855
taking a sponge bath.

08:08.855 --> 08:11.187
Dear God, which sponge

08:11.691 --> 08:13.693
A small one.

08:13.693 --> 08:17.561
This has been
the longest two days of my life.

08:17.864 --> 08:19.923
Well, what do you think,
it's been a vacation for me?

08:20.633 --> 08:24.937
i have cooked her meals,
i have massaged her feet.

08:24.937 --> 08:26.632
i've also applauded wildIy

08:26.939 --> 08:29.635
to her trumpet rendition of
"Froggy Went A-Courtin'. "

08:29.942 --> 08:30.931
(doorbell ringing)

08:31.644 --> 08:32.945
But i have won her over.

08:32.945 --> 08:35.948
There will be no discussion
of a lawsuit tomorrow .

08:35.948 --> 08:37.643
when i send her a-packin'?

08:38.918 --> 08:39.611
Oh, Niles.

08:39.919 --> 08:40.919
Hey, Frasier. Hey, Dad.

08:40.919 --> 08:42.922
Brace yourself:

08:42.922 --> 08:44.924
i finally got around
to returning

08:44.924 --> 08:46.626
your escargot clamps.

08:46.626 --> 08:48.617
.
Oh... oh, thank you, Niles

08:49.929 --> 08:51.631
Oh, that's what those are.

08:51.631 --> 08:52.732
i've been using them
to pull ticks

08:52.732 --> 08:55.635
out of Eddie's coat.

08:55.635 --> 08:57.626
Sherry?
Oh, please. Yes, thank you.

08:58.037 --> 09:00.106
i have Maris news.

09:00.106 --> 09:01.596
She's auctioning off
some of her things

09:02.108 --> 09:03.609
to help pay for her defense.

09:03.609 --> 09:06.612
She's letting me come by firstto
claim anything i want.

09:06.612 --> 09:10.810
Well, this is my chance to seize
and destroy my boudoir painting.

09:11.117 --> 09:12.175
What's that?

09:12.652 --> 09:15.712
Oh, well, years ago, Maris and i
got the idea in our heads

09:16.022 --> 09:18.024
to commission portraits of a...

09:18.024 --> 09:22.728
well, a quasi-erotic nature.

09:22.728 --> 09:23.626
Dear God.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.571
Continue.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.563
Well, Maris is depicted
as a doe-eyed wood nymph,

09:34.874 --> 09:37.570
while in my painting,
i am the satyr, Pan...

09:39.579 --> 09:41.581
a louche, sybaritic goat-man

09:41.581 --> 09:44.573
with a depraved appetite
for all things sensual.

09:46.852 --> 09:48.911
.
Oh, i forgot to lock that door

09:49.322 --> 09:51.857
Your dad surI.
got an eyefue

09:51.857 --> 09:53.848
Yes, uh, bumbling old man.

09:54.360 --> 09:55.695
i'm terribly sorry.

09:55.695 --> 09:58.061
Well, no birthday gift for him
this year-- he's had it.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.168
Hi, Niles.

10:02.168 --> 10:05.671
Hello, Ann.
it's so nice to see you.

10:05.671 --> 10:07.673
i'm sorry i can't stay.

10:07.673 --> 10:10.676
You're leaving?
You're always leaving.

10:10.676 --> 10:12.078
NiLES:
Oh, just lately.

10:12.078 --> 10:13.170
Bye.
FRASiER:Bye-bye, Niles.

10:13.713 --> 10:15.781
Uh, well,
wait till you see

10:15.781 --> 10:19.085
what i've made you
for dinner this evening.

10:19.085 --> 10:20.086
Your favorite--

10:20.086 --> 10:24.785
mac and cheese
with sliced hot dogs.

10:24.890 --> 10:25.982
...
Oh

10:26.692 --> 10:27.994
,
You keep pampering me this way

10:27.994 --> 10:30.763
it'll be hard
to go home next month.

10:30.763 --> 10:31.923
Next month?

10:32.264 --> 10:34.800
Well, let's cross our fingers.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.791
.
My bones tend to knit slowly

10:37.236 --> 10:41.273
Uh, aren't you afraid

10:41.273 --> 10:44.143
to leave your apartment
untended for a whole month?

10:44.143 --> 10:45.945
Not a problem.

10:45.945 --> 10:47.947
i just sublet it this morning
to a girl from work.

10:47.947 --> 10:51.849
if she chips so much as one
of my porcelain piggies,

10:52.351 --> 10:54.751
i'll sue her six ways to Sunday.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.813
if you want to beat her to death
with one of her crutches,

10:59.125 --> 11:01.116
i can show you how to make it
look like an accident.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.831
Here is everything.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.834
i tell Missy Crane
you are here.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.336
Thank you, Marta.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.826
Wow. Maybe i can find . .

11:12.338 --> 11:14.340
something nice
for Ronee here.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.841
has
This whole
Ann thing

11:15.841 --> 11:18.708
got me practically living over there.

11:18.978 --> 11:20.813
Look at this
fancy back-scratcher.

11:20.813 --> 11:22.381
That's not exactly what it is.

11:22.381 --> 11:23.871
Every winter,
Maris would fly down

11:24.383 --> 11:26.874
to the private isl
and her family owns in
the South Pacific.

11:27.386 --> 11:29.889
On Christmas, she'd let
the native children come by

11:29.889 --> 11:31.390
and fish coins
from her fountain.

11:31.390 --> 11:33.859
Oh. Some kind
of coin-scooper, huh?

11:33.859 --> 11:35.895
No. it's a stick with a claw on
the end of it

11:35.895 --> 11:37.886
in case any of
the children got too close to her.

11:43.969 --> 11:45.960
.
Ah! i found me

11:46.472 --> 11:48.474
Daphne,
avert your eyes.

11:48.474 --> 11:50.476
Let's just get t
his thing wrapped up

11:50.476 --> 11:52.478
and into my trunk.

11:52.478 --> 11:57.483
Oh, geez! How could
you stand to look
at yourself like that?

11:57.483 --> 11:58.984
.
i never had to

11:58.984 --> 12:00.474
it was in Maris's bedroom.

12:03.189 --> 12:05.191
Uh... Marta?

12:05.191 --> 12:07.193
Tell Maris we'll
be back to say good-bye.

12:07.193 --> 12:08.894
Yes, Dr. Crane.

12:08.894 --> 12:09.758
Thank you.

12:14.433 --> 12:16.435
You were right, Missy Crane.

12:16.435 --> 12:17.937
They take the painting
right away.

12:17.937 --> 12:19.438
.
Now drink your protein shake

12:19.438 --> 12:21.429
You have a long trip
ahead of you.

12:25.444 --> 12:27.947
.
Oh! Very good, Missy Crane

12:27.947 --> 12:29.938
You drink a lot.

12:30.449 --> 12:32.940
What? Too much? Okay.

12:38.457 --> 12:39.992
Oh, here they come.

12:39.992 --> 12:41.084
...
i can't tell you

12:41.527 --> 12:42.516
w?
Can we
leave no

12:43.028 --> 12:44.518
This place gives
me the chills.

12:45.030 --> 12:46.532
it was designed to.

12:46.532 --> 12:48.397
.
Just let me say good-bye
to Maris, and we'll be out..

12:48.934 --> 12:49.802
Doctor! Doctor!

12:49.802 --> 12:50.803
What is it, Marta?

12:50.803 --> 12:52.304
i no find Missy Crane.

12:52.304 --> 12:54.295
i go up to her room,
and all there is is this note.

12:57.309 --> 12:58.811
Dear God.

12:58.811 --> 13:01.814
She says she doesn't believe
she can get a fair trial,

13:01.814 --> 13:03.816
and she can't face life
in prison,

13:03.816 --> 13:05.818
so she's going to hurl herseIf

13:05.818 --> 13:08.320
off the State Senator
Harry R. Burton Bridge.

13:08.320 --> 13:11.323
Marta, when was the last time
you saw Maris?

13:11.323 --> 13:12.324
Just before you come.

13:12.324 --> 13:13.313
Maybe we can
still catch her.

13:13.826 --> 13:14.827
Well, don't panic.

13:14.827 --> 13:15.828
She still has that tracking device.

13:15.828 --> 13:16.829
The cops
will stop her.

13:16.829 --> 13:18.330
,
Yes, but if we can catch her

13:18.330 --> 13:19.319
maybe i can talk her down!

13:22.334 --> 13:23.836
Perfect, Missy Crane.

13:23.836 --> 13:25.838
i put the tracking bracelet
behind the painting,

13:25.838 --> 13:27.339
just like you say.

13:27.339 --> 13:28.829
The workmen will
take you in a minute.

13:29.341 --> 13:30.831
What? Okay.

13:32.000 --> 13:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:39.218 --> 13:40.913
Hey, Frasier,
i'm glad i caught you.

13:41.420 --> 13:42.409
Did you just get home?

13:42.922 --> 13:44.412
No. i've been here awhile.

13:44.924 --> 13:47.984
i can't bring
myself to go in.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.485
Not with her in there.

13:50.996 --> 13:53.988
(trumpet plays off-key)

13:56.468 --> 13:57.457
She's getting better.

13:59.471 --> 14:01.473
Look, i did you a favor.

14:01.473 --> 14:03.464
My lawyer
drew up this document.

14:03.909 --> 14:05.444
it releases you
from all liability

14:05.444 --> 14:06.934
if you can just get
Ann to sign it.

14:07.446 --> 14:08.447
way
Oh, Roz,
there's no

14:08.447 --> 14:10.005
i'm going to
get her to sign this.

14:11.550 --> 14:14.542
i've just booked passage
for her and her mother

14:15.054 --> 14:17.056
on a two-week cruise to Alaska.

14:17.056 --> 14:20.059
That way, i'll get her
out of my home,

14:20.059 --> 14:22.425
but she'll still feel
like we're friends.

14:22.962 --> 14:23.996
Hmm. Not a bad idea.

14:23.996 --> 14:25.998
Good luck with that.
Thank you.

14:25.998 --> 14:28.000
Roz, i've been
meaning to ask you

14:28.000 --> 14:29.991
How did you
ever becomefriends with Ann?

14:30.302 --> 14:32.004
She's not really
your type, is she?

14:32.004 --> 14:35.201
Oh, we're not really friends.
I rear-ended her in 1989.

14:39.478 --> 14:40.980
Well, i say divorce him

14:40.980 --> 14:42.971
and take him
to the cleaners.

14:43.382 --> 14:44.917
When you play
with someone's heart,

14:44.917 --> 14:45.906
you deserve to pay big-time.

14:46.418 --> 14:47.908
My ex sure did.

14:48.420 --> 14:50.923
Yes! He's still living
in his van,

14:50.923 --> 14:54.984
and he's lucky
i let him keep that.

14:55.127 --> 14:56.629
Listen, i got to go.

14:56.629 --> 14:59.632
.
My Bunny's home,
and he's looking so handsome

14:59.632 --> 15:00.997
Okay.

15:01.233 --> 15:02.029
i'll call you later.

15:02.268 --> 15:03.257
You!

15:04.570 --> 15:06.105
Alaska?

15:06.105 --> 15:07.333
Oh, the tickets arrived.

15:07.673 --> 15:08.731
You bet they did.

15:09.174 --> 15:11.677
i just called my mother,
and she's thrilled.

15:11.677 --> 15:13.076
.
Well, i hoped she would be

15:13.379 --> 15:16.177
!
.
She can't believe that
you're taking me to Alaska

15:19.118 --> 15:21.109
You... you told her
i was taking you?

15:21.353 --> 15:24.356
Don't worry. i told her your
intentions were honorable...

15:24.356 --> 15:26.256
(whispering):
but they better not be.

15:28.193 --> 15:30.195
Ann...

15:30.195 --> 15:32.698
You know, i've been
wondering all week

15:32.698 --> 15:34.700
"Why is Frasier
keeping me here?

15:34.700 --> 15:38.203
He could have just
sent me home with a nurse. "

15:38.203 --> 15:41.206
But then i got these,
and i figured it out.

15:41.206 --> 15:42.696
You've got a thing for me.

15:45.244 --> 15:47.712
Well, i've got news
for you, Romeo.

15:48.047 --> 15:51.050
Hold that thought
while Bunny goes

15:51.050 --> 15:55.043
and pours himself
a big ol' glass of wine.

15:55.554 --> 15:57.044
(doorbell rings)

16:03.062 --> 16:04.563
Caroline.

16:04.563 --> 16:06.463
Hi, Frasier.
Am i early?

16:06.765 --> 16:07.356
Uh...

16:08.000 --> 16:08.989
Who are you?

16:10.402 --> 16:11.403
Just a neighbor.

16:11.403 --> 16:14.306
?!
..
is our date still on?
Date

16:14.306 --> 16:16.308
No!

16:16.308 --> 16:17.172
Since we made

16:17.609 --> 16:19.144
our plans, Caroline,

16:19.144 --> 16:21.135
i've met someone else.

16:23.248 --> 16:25.307
.
Me! So beat it

16:25.751 --> 16:26.240
Frasier?

16:26.652 --> 16:27.744
Just go!

16:32.691 --> 16:34.181
Well...

16:34.626 --> 16:37.162
someone's quite the tomcat.

16:37.162 --> 16:41.100
i don't know what i'm going to do with you.

16:41.100 --> 16:43.193
i don't know what
i'm going to do

16:43.502 --> 16:44.491
with you either.

16:46.505 --> 16:47.733
Hey!

16:48.207 --> 16:51.677
Hey, Bunny, what's this?

16:51.677 --> 16:53.212
Oh, it's... it's nothing
. Just... just work stuff.

16:53.212 --> 16:55.214
it's got my name on it.

16:55.214 --> 16:56.704
it's a liability release.

16:57.149 --> 16:58.741
Oh, my gosh.

16:59.151 --> 17:01.551
.
You think i'm going to sue you
?No

17:02.054 --> 17:04.045
So that's why you've been so nice to me.

17:04.522 --> 17:07.059
Because you're afraid
of a lawsuit.

17:07.059 --> 17:10.118
So this whole romance
was just a fake!

17:12.431 --> 17:13.420
No. Never.

17:14.133 --> 17:17.469
Well, i've got news for you.
Nobody plays with my heart!

17:17.469 --> 17:19.060
ishouldsue you!

17:19.304 --> 17:22.808
i realize that you're
angry now, Bunny...

17:22.808 --> 17:25.208
You'reBunny!
i'm calling a lawyer!

17:25.577 --> 17:28.671
All right, fine!
Go ahead and sue!

17:29.081 --> 17:31.572
i am fed up
with this charade.

17:32.151 --> 17:34.253
This was an accident.

17:34.253 --> 17:37.556
i have cared for you,
i have waited on you,

17:37.556 --> 17:41.788
i have pumiced your heels
and set your hair!

17:42.194 --> 17:43.662
.
Well..

17:43.662 --> 17:46.665
if that's not enough
for you, so be it!

17:46.665 --> 17:48.167
i don't care anymore!

17:48.167 --> 17:50.669
i will not beg!

17:50.669 --> 17:54.673
You can take me to the cleaners,
but you cannot take my dignity!

17:54.673 --> 17:56.538
Okay. See you in court.

17:57.109 --> 17:58.508
!
.
Dear God,
please, no

17:59.211 --> 17:59.506
!
.
Please! No

18:05.517 --> 18:08.213
My... things.

18:08.487 --> 18:10.580
.
My beautiful, beautiful things

18:11.190 --> 18:13.181
i... i love them so!

18:16.228 --> 18:17.160
Are you crying?

18:17.362 --> 18:19.330
No.

18:19.498 --> 18:21.200
Gross!

18:21.200 --> 18:24.203
Frasier, pull yourself together.

18:24.203 --> 18:26.364
i'll sign your stupid paper.

18:26.705 --> 18:27.797
You will?

18:28.240 --> 18:31.107
God! To think
i had a thing for you.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.602
Can i pick 'em, or what?

18:37.116 --> 18:39.209
.
Thank you, Ann

18:39.384 --> 18:40.886
i'm sorry it had to come down

18:40.886 --> 18:42.387
.
to all this
legal business

18:42.387 --> 18:44.890
if it were up to me,
i would tear up

18:44.890 --> 18:46.391
this piece of pape
r and forget everything

18:46.391 --> 18:47.881
that's happened here.

18:48.393 --> 18:50.884
And, uh... here.

18:53.899 --> 18:56.390
And... here.

19:02.274 --> 19:05.177
Yes, Officer. We're
headed east on Highway
61 toward the bridge.

19:05.177 --> 19:07.479
Do you have a read
on her tracking bracelet yet?

19:07.479 --> 19:10.482
They say she just
passed exit 29.

19:10.482 --> 19:11.471
Wejust passed exit 29.

19:12.184 --> 19:13.485
i don't see anyone
ahead of us.

19:13.485 --> 19:14.486
You suppose we passed her?

19:14.486 --> 19:16.488
There is a car behind us.

19:16.488 --> 19:17.489
(siren blaring)

19:17.489 --> 19:19.184
OFFiCER:
Pull over immediately.

19:19.491 --> 19:20.492
Dad, you were a cop.
What do we do?

19:20.492 --> 19:22.187
Pull over immediately.

19:25.430 --> 19:27.666
We don't have time for this!
We need to get to the bridge!

19:27.666 --> 19:29.168
According
to our tracking device,

19:29.168 --> 19:30.669
your wife's in this vehicle.

19:30.669 --> 19:32.171
But that's absurd!

19:32.171 --> 19:33.661
ife.
And she's his ex-w

19:34.173 --> 19:35.674
Oh, no. The press is here.

19:35.674 --> 19:37.164
Open the trunk, sir.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.178
(stammering):
There's an item of a very

19:39.178 --> 19:40.167
personal nature in there.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.181
if you could just
keep the media away?

19:42.181 --> 19:43.671
Now!

19:47.686 --> 19:49.677
See? See? No Maris.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.690
Oh! Uh...
Be careful with that.

19:51.690 --> 19:54.193
That... that's what
i didn't want you to...

19:54.193 --> 19:55.182
Oh, geez.

19:56.695 --> 19:58.197
What the hell is that?

19:58.197 --> 19:59.698
it's Pan the satyr,

19:59.698 --> 20:03.190
a minor god of mischief,
debauchery and fornication.

20:05.204 --> 20:10.209
That's what our son would
look like if i were a goat.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.700
.
There's your tracking device right there

20:13.212 --> 20:14.201
She conned us!

20:14.713 --> 20:16.215
Well, you have
your bracelet.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.217
i guess i'll just
take my painting.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.219
Sorry, sir.
This is evidence.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.311
No!

20:25.691 --> 20:28.285
"...so i shipped myself
to our private island,

20:28.794 --> 20:30.284
"where, like
dear Uncle Julius,

20:30.796 --> 20:32.696
"i will be immune
from extradition.

20:32.998 --> 20:34.499
"Thank you all, and forgive me.

20:34.499 --> 20:35.966
"Best regards, Maris.

20:36.468 --> 20:38.959
"P.S. Big ups to all
my homies in lockdown.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.501
Stay black. Cell block D. "

20:49.248 --> 20:52.751
.
So you were the decoys

20:52.751 --> 20:54.651
it's ingenious.

20:55.053 --> 20:56.987
How did she get
the tracking bracelet off?

20:57.389 --> 20:59.258
Mmm. Apparently,
she swallowed a salt tablet

20:59.258 --> 21:01.760
to make her ankles swell
right before they fitted her.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.762
And then,
when the swelling went down,

21:03.762 --> 21:05.252
the bracelet just
slipped right off.

21:07.266 --> 21:10.360
So that's it. No more Maris.

21:10.602 --> 21:13.070
Strange to think
i'll never see her again

21:13.405 --> 21:14.840
,
She was a pain

21:14.840 --> 21:16.831
but she
was a character.

21:17.309 --> 21:20.412
Well, then, let's drink
a toast to her.

21:20.412 --> 21:22.937
Well, there's just a...
a drop left.

21:23.382 --> 21:25.646
Perfect. i can't think
of a more fitting toast.

21:26.051 --> 21:28.884
Yeah. There we go.

21:31.790 --> 21:36.591
To Maris.
