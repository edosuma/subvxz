02:41.761 --> 02:43.362
You can do this.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.370
Steady!

03:33.479 --> 03:35.247
Give me your hand!

03:39.619 --> 03:41.420
I can't reach!

03:50.597 --> 03:51.930
No!!

03:55.001 --> 03:57.236
What do I do?!

03:59.973 --> 04:01.473
Here!

08:07.753 --> 08:13.091
- Okay. September 4th, take two
a long way home.

11:28.754 --> 11:31.690
- Hey, coming in at the
top of the charts this week

11:31.692 --> 11:33.792
it's a new band...

12:03.422 --> 12:05.223
- Come on...

14:24.964 --> 14:28.366
- One day, in a little village
close to where I used to live,

14:28.368 --> 14:32.904
but far from me today,
a little girl was born.

14:38.978 --> 14:40.645
She was called vaysha.

14:40.647 --> 14:43.314
A beautiful little girl,
said the villagers.

14:43.582 --> 14:47.252
Her mother looked
at her with adoration.

14:48.454 --> 14:52.490
How could this mother,
leaning over the cradle,

14:52.492 --> 14:57.428
imagine that her little girl's
eyes would see things this way?

14:57.897 --> 14:59.597
Little vaysha had been born

14:59.599 --> 15:01.299
with a left eye
that only saw the past

15:01.301 --> 15:01.666
and a right eye
that only saw the future.

15:05.471 --> 15:08.273
When little vaysha
grew up and began to talk,

15:08.275 --> 15:11.342
she explained
that she saw the sky like this.

15:13.479 --> 15:15.647
And even though
her eyes were open,

15:15.649 --> 15:17.682
like those
of any sighted person,

15:17.684 --> 15:20.585
it was as though
vaysha was blind.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.320
"Vaysha the blind girl."

15:22.322 --> 15:25.356
This was how
everyone came to call her.

15:45.577 --> 15:47.645
Everyone was convinced
that vaysha's eyes

15:49.515 --> 15:51.382
were the result of black magic.

15:52.385 --> 15:54.686
A gaggle of old medicine women

15:54.688 --> 15:58.156
paraded into the
house to identify the spell

15:58.158 --> 16:00.992
and attempt to heal the
little girl of this affliction.

16:19.445 --> 16:21.479
Drink the
extract of blue thistle

16:22.081 --> 16:24.248
for 40 days
before the sun rises.

16:25.017 --> 16:28.586
Place the gallbladder
of a buzzard on the left eye,

16:28.588 --> 16:31.356
the heart of a rooster
on the right eye,

16:31.358 --> 16:33.992
an oscillated peacock feather

16:33.994 --> 16:36.995
and the tongue of
a horned viper on both.

16:48.474 --> 16:51.342
The old woman whispered
that nothing would work

16:51.344 --> 16:54.045
unless a way was
found to reunite her eyes

16:54.047 --> 16:56.414
and bring her
back to this world.

16:56.416 --> 17:00.418
All attempts to restore
her normal vision failed.

17:05.624 --> 17:09.292
In the courtyard, she
advanced with outstretched arms,

17:09.295 --> 17:11.194
and bumped into the cherry tree.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.730
She toppled pots in the shed.

17:12.732 --> 17:15.233
Ripe cherries
or the pots to gather them -

17:15.234 --> 17:18.069
these did not exist for her.

17:18.070 --> 17:21.271
In her eyes,
the present did not exist.

17:24.276 --> 17:25.810
Vaysha grew up.

17:25.811 --> 17:27.612
She became
a beautiful young woman.

17:27.614 --> 17:31.315
The fact that she had
one green eye and one brown eye

17:31.317 --> 17:33.351
only added to her beauty.

17:33.353 --> 17:38.156
One day, a young man
came to ask for her hand.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.758
When she laid her eyes on him,
this is what she saw.

17:40.760 --> 17:45.129
-<i> My goodness, what has</i>

17:45.131 --> 17:47.065
<i> ...his hair is all white.</i>

17:47.067 --> 17:50.134
<i> Poor dear. My goodness,</i>
<i> he smells like dirt.</i>

17:50.136 --> 17:51.803
<i> His shirt is not</i>
<i> tucked in his pants,</i>

17:51.805 --> 17:51.803
<i> his knees are all scraped.</i>

17:51.805 --> 17:56.507
<i> His time has come and</i>
<i> he's asking me to marry him.</i>

17:56.509 --> 17:59.310
<i> I could be his mother.</i>
<i> It must be a joke.</i>

17:59.312 --> 18:02.213
- The same story was
repeated with each suitor.

18:03.115 --> 18:05.483
Vaysha was
unable to find any man

18:05.485 --> 18:08.086
who could unite her sight.

18:09.621 --> 18:12.156
She rarely left the house.

18:12.158 --> 18:15.827
In her eyes,
the present did not exist.

18:22.134 --> 18:23.534
Even at night,

18:23.536 --> 18:26.671
while vaysha slept,
she could not truly rest.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.673
She had nightmares.

18:28.675 --> 18:33.244
Like a serpent's tongue,
her dreams would split in two.

18:33.246 --> 18:36.848
On one side, she saw
herself as a little girl;

18:36.850 --> 18:40.852
and on the other,
she saw herself already dead.

18:40.854 --> 18:43.521
Sometimes the difference
between the two eyes was slight,

18:43.523 --> 18:45.523
only a few hours apart.

18:45.525 --> 18:48.693
For the left eye,
the sun had just risen.

18:48.695 --> 18:51.696
The right eye was
already seeing the moon shine.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.698
But other times,

18:53.700 --> 18:57.201
her left eye only showed
her an abyss and a great void,

18:57.203 --> 18:59.237
like that
which preceded creation,

18:59.239 --> 19:03.541
while her right eye could only
perceive ruins and disaster,

19:03.543 --> 19:06.611
after what could
have been an apocalypse.

19:09.882 --> 19:13.451
It was difficult for vaysha
to live with her disability.

19:13.453 --> 19:16.287
This is why one day,
out of desperation,

19:16.289 --> 19:19.924
she had the idea of tearing
out an eye with her own hands.

19:19.926 --> 19:22.460
But she didn't know which one.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.395
If she chose
to remove her left eye,

19:24.397 --> 19:27.198
that would mean that she would
live forever in the future.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.468
And the future...

19:48.453 --> 19:51.489
And the future, it scared her.

19:51.491 --> 19:54.225
It was dark and depressing.

19:55.294 --> 19:57.828
However,
if she removed her right eye,

19:57.830 --> 20:00.331
she could live in the past,

20:00.333 --> 20:02.967
which is always more
certain and reassuring.

20:02.969 --> 20:06.571
But how to live with
parents who are young children?

20:09.942 --> 20:11.976
Vaysha could not be happy,

20:11.978 --> 20:14.679
neither in the past
nor in the future.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.981
This story is a hopeless story,

20:16.983 --> 20:19.684
because we cannot find
anything in this world

20:19.686 --> 20:22.920
capable of
reuniting these two views.

20:33.398 --> 20:35.967
And now, dear audience,

20:35.969 --> 20:38.502
close your right eye.

20:38.504 --> 20:41.505
How sad if, with your left eye,

20:41.507 --> 20:44.976
you could no longer
see any film or any story,

20:44.978 --> 20:48.246
only the blank page
preceding the story.

20:49.648 --> 20:51.415
Woe to you.

20:52.818 --> 20:54.986
And now close your left eye.

20:55.954 --> 20:57.722
If you still
do not see the film,

20:57.724 --> 20:58.856
because it is already erased

21:00.626 --> 21:02.493
and the images have
become dust and white ash...

21:04.396 --> 21:06.330
Woe to me.

21:09.034 --> 21:11.302
Do we look at the world

21:11.304 --> 21:13.671
with the eyes
of vaysha the blind?

22:08.660 --> 22:11.362
I received a
Christmas card this morning.

22:11.364 --> 22:14.765
It didn't come with the
regular mail for some reason.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.701
That was a bit strange.

22:16.703 --> 22:20.671
It was also strange that it was
addressed from my friend techno.

22:20.673 --> 22:24.041
It read: "Hey rob,
if you are reading this, that

22:24.043 --> 22:26.777
means I'm dead.

22:26.779 --> 22:28.412
I just want to say thanks.

22:28.414 --> 22:30.981
I'll see you soon.

22:30.983 --> 22:32.650
Go get drunk on me.

22:32.652 --> 22:35.820
Techno."

22:35.822 --> 22:37.555
Techno stypes.

22:37.557 --> 22:39.123
What a guy he was.

22:39.125 --> 22:41.492
He always said he'd
never make it to forty.

22:46.064 --> 22:50.134
A year and a half earlier,
i was on a plane to China,

22:50.136 --> 22:52.103
I was on my way to see techno.

22:55.040 --> 22:58.442
He was at the military
hospital in Guangzhou,

22:58.444 --> 23:00.544
waiting for a new liver.

23:00.546 --> 23:05.783
His father sent me with two
clear instructions: One - gotta

23:05.785 --> 23:08.953
get techno to stop drinking,
at least long enough

23:08.955 --> 23:11.489
to receive a liver transplant.

23:11.491 --> 23:14.792
And two - get him
back home to Vancouver.

23:20.165 --> 23:22.566
Get techno to stop drinking...

23:22.568 --> 23:24.969
That's not gonna be easy.

23:24.971 --> 23:28.005
Cos that's what techno
really liked to do...

23:28.007 --> 23:29.974
Was drink.

23:31.176 --> 23:33.077
And smoke.

23:36.014 --> 23:37.515
And fight.

23:37.949 --> 23:41.051
He was in no condition to fight.

23:41.053 --> 23:42.920
He was sick.

23:43.188 --> 23:45.089
He was really sick.

23:45.924 --> 23:49.460
He was crippled from a car
accident when he was seventeen,

23:49.462 --> 23:51.996
but that's not how
he lost his big toe.

23:51.998 --> 23:55.933
He lost that in a
motorbike accident.

23:55.935 --> 23:58.969
Yeah, he was broken alright.

23:59.638 --> 24:02.773
What was he
fighting for anyways?

24:02.775 --> 24:05.609
And what was he
still doing in China?

24:08.447 --> 24:12.583
I first met techno
in the fall of 1978.

24:12.585 --> 24:16.720
My first memory of techno
was, we were playing soccer

24:16.722 --> 24:21.725
on this field, and, the ball
was coming right to me.

24:21.727 --> 24:24.195
Right when I was about to jump
for it, this kid jumped right in

24:24.197 --> 24:26.464
front of me and he
jumped higher than

24:26.466 --> 24:29.099
I'd ever seen
anybody jump before.

24:29.101 --> 24:32.236
And he chested the ball,
sorta trapped it, and then he

24:32.238 --> 24:36.574
kicked it, from about
halfway across the field,

24:36.576 --> 24:39.109
and I'm pretty sure
he scored....

24:39.111 --> 24:42.947
Another time, there was this
sports day at school,

24:42.949 --> 24:46.050
and I remember he
casually picked up this ball,

24:46.052 --> 24:49.253
and he chucked it,
right across the field.

24:49.255 --> 24:52.590
And I remember going up after
him, and thinking 'oh I could do

24:52.592 --> 24:58.162
that', and I chucked the ball
as hard as I could, and it only

24:58.164 --> 25:00.731
went halfway across the field.

25:00.733 --> 25:03.000
For the next little while, i
went to that school on the

25:03.002 --> 25:06.837
weekends and practised throwing
balls, to see if I could throw

25:06.839 --> 25:11.909
it across the field, and i
never got anywhere near it.

25:11.911 --> 25:13.978
But I'll tell you one thing.

25:13.980 --> 25:16.947
Techno was fast.

25:16.949 --> 25:21.185
Techno was the fastest
human I'd ever seen.

25:21.187 --> 25:24.755
When he ran, he just took off.

25:24.757 --> 25:27.725
There's no way you
could ever catch him.

25:28.627 --> 25:33.163
And so there I was, I couldn't
really Chuck a ball too far,

25:33.165 --> 25:35.232
and I didn't really play hockey,

25:35.234 --> 25:37.835
and I didn't really play
soccer either.

25:37.837 --> 25:42.306
All I did, all the
time, was I used to draw.

25:43.808 --> 25:46.076
And that's the one thing i
could do that techno couldn't

25:46.078 --> 25:52.116
really do, and so, we
became friends after that.

25:57.022 --> 26:00.691
One day techno said, 'hey, do
you wanna go shoot some balls

26:00.693 --> 26:06.163
around after school?' And I said
'yeah, ok.' In the middle of us

26:06.165 --> 26:09.767
playing around, techno went
berserk, he proceeded to break

26:09.769 --> 26:12.202
about 20 windows at the school.

26:12.204 --> 26:16.240
We were walking home, and we got
picked up by a squad car, and I

26:16.242 --> 26:18.943
remember thinking i
really didn't like to be

26:18.945 --> 26:20.911
in the back of a squad car.

26:21.947 --> 26:26.917
I looked over, and
techno thought it was great.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.119
And that kind of
explains the difference

26:29.121 --> 26:31.956
between the two of us.

26:31.958 --> 26:35.726
And we were only like twelve
years old, and he used to tell

26:35.728 --> 26:39.229
us these stories about fucking
his girlfriend, and I remember I

26:39.231 --> 26:43.834
didn't even have pubic hair yet
like that's how young we were.

26:43.836 --> 26:46.704
I guess that's the thing with
him, it seemed like he could

26:46.706 --> 26:49.173
always just pull it off.

26:49.175 --> 26:51.642
Whether he was
diving off a cliff,

26:51.644 --> 26:54.645
or riding his skateboard
through traffic...

26:54.647 --> 26:58.282
It just seemed like he
could always just pull it off.

27:20.005 --> 27:23.007
Techno's daredevil heroics
were the stuff of legend

27:23.009 --> 27:25.776
to us regular teenagers.

27:27.412 --> 27:31.715
To befriend techno was to board
a thrill ride of some sort.

27:41.893 --> 27:45.295
Techno pushed the limits of
whatever situation he was in.

27:49.067 --> 27:54.071
The greater the danger,
the greater the thrill.

28:27.372 --> 28:29.139
He loved to steal.

28:29.141 --> 28:33.777
Cars, bikes,
electronics, he didn't care.

28:33.779 --> 28:36.346
He always had some
sort of scam on the go.

28:36.348 --> 28:39.249
And was always
covering it with lies.

28:39.251 --> 28:41.452
The stealing eventually got
him in trouble with some of the

28:41.454 --> 28:44.254
senior students in high school.

28:46.091 --> 28:48.125
That was bad news.

28:49.160 --> 28:52.863
Then he started
stealing from his friends.

28:52.865 --> 28:55.733
Then nobody could trust him.

28:57.769 --> 29:00.204
It was around this time, that
techno started hanging around

29:00.206 --> 29:02.306
with a bunch of dickheads
wearing alligator shirts with

29:02.308 --> 29:04.842
the collars turned up.

29:06.778 --> 29:08.979
I didn't really care
much for these guys, but,

29:08.981 --> 29:13.183
I have to admit, they
were getting lots of pussy.

29:13.185 --> 29:16.153
One evening, techno phoned me up
and asked me if I wanted to go

29:16.155 --> 29:21.859
to a party at the other end of
town, with his dickhead buddies.

29:21.861 --> 29:23.460
I declined.

29:24.496 --> 29:27.264
It was the summer
of our graduation.

29:27.266 --> 29:29.466
We were seventeen.

29:34.939 --> 29:37.474
Techno was completely
in control, and completely

29:37.476 --> 29:40.944
out of control at the same time.

29:46.152 --> 29:50.387
An emergency crew showed up
to the scene of the accident...

29:50.389 --> 29:53.791
And techno was
nowhere to be seen.

29:53.793 --> 29:56.193
After some time they
found him in a bush...

29:56.195 --> 29:59.163
Fifty yards away
from the crash site.

30:00.231 --> 30:06.069
He was busted up pretty good,
he nearly lost a leg

30:06.071 --> 30:09.139
and there was some
significant brain trauma.

30:12.577 --> 30:15.979
He drifted in and out of
consciousness long enough

30:15.981 --> 30:19.216
to wave goodbye to me.

30:19.218 --> 30:22.252
I was on my way to the airport.

30:22.254 --> 30:25.289
I was off to
calgary to become a realtor.

30:28.459 --> 30:31.161
Techno had a very
long recovery and his

30:31.163 --> 30:34.431
friends gradually
stopped visiting.

30:34.433 --> 30:38.035
He'd burned a lot of Bridges
right before the accident.

30:38.037 --> 30:39.469
It must've been very lonely
sitting in the hospital for the

30:39.471 --> 30:43.173
better part of two years,

30:43.175 --> 30:46.210
wondering where all
your friends are.

30:46.212 --> 30:48.445
But recover he did.

30:48.447 --> 30:53.483
His speech was different, slower
and slurred, and he had a limp.

30:54.319 --> 30:57.621
I'd come by and visit him
whenever I was in town...

31:02.060 --> 31:06.864
This is right around the time
he started to drink regularly.

31:06.866 --> 31:08.398
One day techno
announced that his

31:08.400 --> 31:10.500
insurance settlement
had came in.

31:10.502 --> 31:12.469
This time he wasn't lying.

31:12.471 --> 31:16.607
One and a half million dollars
it took the lawyers ten years

31:16.609 --> 31:18.542
to settle his case.

31:19.644 --> 31:21.979
There were many points in
techno's life where you could

31:21.981 --> 31:26.216
say, 'this was the beginning
of all his troubles', the car

31:26.218 --> 31:31.054
accident was surely one of these
points, the day his settlement

31:31.056 --> 31:33.223
came in was another.

31:39.330 --> 31:41.565
And that's when Jennifer
entered the scene.

31:48.539 --> 31:50.540
She was a damn drunk.

31:53.945 --> 31:59.249
When she was done with him
he too would be a damn drunk.

32:08.159 --> 32:10.127
Techno was a funny millionaire.

32:19.170 --> 32:21.471
He dressed and
acted like a skid.

32:23.074 --> 32:26.476
He smoked dog
ends off the street.

32:26.478 --> 32:30.180
His drink of
choice was pear cider.

32:30.182 --> 32:33.483
Techno asked me to be
the best man at his wedding.

32:33.485 --> 32:35.218
I refused.

32:35.553 --> 32:38.488
His wife poured spaghetti on
his head and burned his eyelids

32:38.490 --> 32:41.091
with cigarette butts.

32:44.128 --> 32:48.465
I'm not sure where this happens
on the timeline, but one day

32:48.467 --> 32:51.101
techno was riding his motorbike.

32:55.273 --> 32:59.343
As he was looking back
to merge onto the highway,

32:59.345 --> 33:02.412
he ran into the merge sign.

33:03.648 --> 33:07.351
The sign clipped the toe
pedal right off his motorbike

33:07.353 --> 33:09.653
and took his big toe
right along with it.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.691
This would add an
even more pronounced limp

33:14.693 --> 33:16.660
to his walk...

33:25.103 --> 33:27.037
More time passed.

33:43.788 --> 33:48.458
One day I went out to the bay
where he lived to visit him.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.027
I pulled over.

33:51.529 --> 33:54.498
As he bent down to lean
into the window I noticed he had

33:54.500 --> 33:57.801
a really yellow complexion.

33:57.803 --> 34:01.405
Apparently, he was given
bad blood from the hospital

34:01.407 --> 34:03.807
and contracted hepatitis c.

34:03.809 --> 34:06.209
He would eventually
sue the hospital for

34:06.211 --> 34:08.612
another 600 thousand dollars.

34:08.614 --> 34:11.181
By this time
techno was very rich.

34:11.183 --> 34:14.217
He always had an odd assortment
of hangers-on available

34:14.219 --> 34:16.219
to do odd jobs for him.

34:16.221 --> 34:20.290
There was Freddy the freeloader,
dump truck, Teddy two fingers,

34:20.292 --> 34:21.824
and dogbreath...

34:21.827 --> 34:24.161
This guy was a piece of work.

34:24.163 --> 34:26.596
Most of them were crackheads.

34:26.598 --> 34:29.065
Techno could stay
up for days on end,

34:29.068 --> 34:32.268
Polish off dozens
of pear cider in one sitting.

34:32.271 --> 34:36.540
He'd get drunk and get on the
horn, and call everyone he knew

34:36.542 --> 34:39.643
and invite them to parties
at his buddy's warehouse.

34:39.645 --> 34:41.812
He claimed celebrities
would be in attendance,

34:41.813 --> 34:44.714
like that
douchebag from nickelback.

34:44.716 --> 34:47.650
No-one I ever knew
went to these parties.

34:50.755 --> 34:53.322
Techno knew his
days were numbered.

34:53.324 --> 34:56.326
He carried on as if
he just didn't care.

34:56.328 --> 35:00.664
According to him,
he had been right on the edge.

35:00.666 --> 35:02.599
He wanted to live.

35:02.601 --> 35:05.602
He loved life in fact,
he just had so much pain.

35:05.604 --> 35:10.173
Pain in his legs, he said
the hep c was terribly painful,

35:10.175 --> 35:12.576
he was always vomiting.

35:12.578 --> 35:16.580
He loved to drink, and
claimed this was the only thing

35:16.582 --> 35:19.182
that relieved his pain.

35:19.184 --> 35:24.287
The combination of drinking and
the hep c wore out his liver,

35:24.289 --> 35:27.290
in pretty short order.

35:27.292 --> 35:30.694
The Canadian transplant
society refused to put him on

35:30.696 --> 35:33.296
the ten year waiting
list for a new liver

35:33.298 --> 35:36.399
unless he stopped drinking.

35:36.401 --> 35:39.202
In ten years
he'd be dead anyways.

35:39.204 --> 35:42.305
Catch-22.

35:42.307 --> 35:44.274
Later...

35:45.843 --> 35:47.777
I was in China.

35:47.779 --> 35:50.547
I received an email from
techno's mother saying that he

35:50.549 --> 35:54.518
too was in China, and
perhaps I could go see him?

35:54.520 --> 35:57.521
As it turned out, he wasn't
far away from where I was.

35:57.523 --> 35:59.556
He was there
with his second wife.

36:01.325 --> 36:03.760
What was techno doing in China?

36:05.897 --> 36:08.365
Techno met Vince in some
unlikely place

36:08.367 --> 36:11.301
in Vancouver, in a pub.

36:11.303 --> 36:13.937
Vince was in the business of
organising transplant services

36:13.939 --> 36:16.773
for those in need.

36:16.775 --> 36:20.377
Techno was on his last legs.

36:20.379 --> 36:22.712
These services did
not come cheap however...

36:22.714 --> 36:25.749
A quarter of a
million dollars up front.

36:25.751 --> 36:27.784
He promised that
techno would be back home

36:27.786 --> 36:30.887
in six weeks with a new liver.

36:30.889 --> 36:35.192
We met him at the white
swan restaurant in Guangzhou.

36:36.661 --> 36:38.662
He didn't look too good.

36:43.834 --> 36:46.570
He was totally sketched out.

36:46.572 --> 36:49.539
I found it strange at dinner
when techno ordered a cocktail,

36:49.541 --> 36:51.908
that it met no
resistance from his wife.

36:51.910 --> 36:55.579
They both assured me that his
old liver was shot anyways,

36:55.581 --> 36:58.548
and that he'd be
receiving a new one soon.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.917
That all seemed
perfectly logical to me,

37:00.919 --> 37:02.953
and I also ordered a cocktail.

37:04.322 --> 37:07.757
It was a perfectly festive
evening...Techno's drinking soon

37:07.759 --> 37:12.429
erupted into utter chaos,
just like it always did.

37:12.431 --> 37:15.398
He was making things more
difficult, in spite of us all

37:15.400 --> 37:17.300
there trying to help him.

37:21.639 --> 37:24.741
We left secure in the knowledge
that techno would soon be back

37:24.743 --> 37:26.643
home with a new liver.

37:28.012 --> 37:29.846
Months passed...

37:29.848 --> 37:32.949
I got word techno was still
in China, still waiting for a

37:32.951 --> 37:35.752
liver, except now
the situation had spun

37:35.754 --> 37:37.921
completely out of control.

37:37.923 --> 37:40.390
His wife left
him there by himself,

37:40.392 --> 37:42.425
he started drinking again.

37:42.427 --> 37:43.727
It really didn't
look like techno

37:43.729 --> 37:45.929
was gonna make it home alive.

37:45.931 --> 37:49.032
I met with techno's father,
we cooked up this plan to try to

37:49.034 --> 37:52.469
get techno back home
one way or the other.

37:52.471 --> 37:55.038
I phoned him up and I said
'look, I'm gonna come out there

37:55.040 --> 37:57.374
and we're gonna try and
get you back home again,'

37:57.376 --> 37:58.908
and all he said was

37:58.910 --> 38:01.678
'well hurry the fuck up.'

38:01.680 --> 38:04.781
I really didn't want to
go back to China...

38:04.783 --> 38:07.717
So there I am on the airplane.

38:07.719 --> 38:10.487
I could see the
sprawling mass of Guangzhou

38:10.489 --> 38:12.989
appear out of the haze.

38:12.991 --> 38:17.661
And as the plane approached
the runway, the real work

38:17.663 --> 38:19.329
was just about to begin.

38:26.737 --> 38:28.838
I passed through
customs and entered

38:28.840 --> 38:30.874
the main concourse
of the airport.

38:30.876 --> 38:32.642
There was a little
girl there named flora,

38:32.644 --> 38:34.511
holding my name on a card.

38:34.513 --> 38:38.381
We exchanged greetings and
she went off to look for techno.

38:38.383 --> 38:41.851
After a while techno appeared.

38:41.853 --> 38:43.486
He shook my hand.

38:43.488 --> 38:46.489
His expression was something
like 'thanks for coming here

38:46.491 --> 38:51.394
man', mine was 'now let's get
you the fuck outta here.'

38:51.396 --> 38:54.764
back at the military
hospital, I met dr Lee.

38:54.766 --> 38:56.866
He explained to me that
it was imperative that

38:56.868 --> 38:58.535
techno quit drinking.

38:58.537 --> 39:01.604
The sooner he quit, the sooner
he was able to receive a new

39:01.606 --> 39:04.040
liver, it was that simple.

39:04.042 --> 39:07.644
And also, if I could get rid
of that damn cat in his room.

39:07.646 --> 39:09.446
I turned to techno...

39:09.448 --> 39:11.548
'Ok, where is it?'

39:11.550 --> 39:15.485
he knew exactly
what I was talking about.

39:15.487 --> 39:20.623
He produced a bottle of baijo,
he was mixing it with gatorade.

39:20.625 --> 39:22.525
'All of it' I said.

39:24.095 --> 39:27.130
It took a while, but eventually
he gathered up all his various

39:27.132 --> 39:30.367
stashes of liquor
hidden around his room.

39:30.369 --> 39:33.136
Satisfied, I dumped it all out
in the toilet,

39:33.138 --> 39:35.572
he didn't like that very much.

39:35.574 --> 39:39.709
On the way out I grabbed the cat
and released it in the courtyard

39:39.711 --> 39:41.678
in the rear of the building.

39:46.083 --> 39:49.419
And then I checked into the
hotel next to the hospital.

39:50.154 --> 39:54.791
I set up my computer and scanner
and got busy on my second book.

40:08.439 --> 40:11.574
The next day I went to go
visit techno in his room.

40:12.610 --> 40:15.178
He was in the middle
of his daily routine.

40:15.180 --> 40:16.780
He was sitting on
the side of his bed

40:16.782 --> 40:20.150
vomiting into a trash bin.

40:20.152 --> 40:22.619
Flora was there,
fussing with his hair and

40:22.621 --> 40:24.454
straightening out his shirt.

40:24.456 --> 40:26.856
I busied myself with something.

40:26.858 --> 40:30.427
I noticed the cat had
somehow returned to the room.

40:30.429 --> 40:31.861
I removed it again.

40:36.767 --> 40:38.768
Techno was hooked up
to an intravenous drip for

40:38.770 --> 40:40.804
the rest of the morning.

40:40.806 --> 40:43.440
We watched an
episode of Seinfeld...

40:43.442 --> 40:46.042
I'm not sure what was in that
drip, but it surely kept him

40:46.044 --> 40:48.645
alive all these months.

40:48.647 --> 40:51.848
Techno rarely got going until
mid-afternoon, and then we would

40:51.850 --> 40:53.917
set out on our little adventure.

40:53.919 --> 40:57.520
This was usually something
simple like going for lunch.

41:00.624 --> 41:03.827
He had the hospital address
written on a piece of paper and

41:03.829 --> 41:05.562
set in plastic.

41:05.564 --> 41:08.731
This was tied around his
neck with a piece of string.

41:08.733 --> 41:12.936
It said something like: 'If
you find me, please return me to

41:12.938 --> 41:16.906
'dot dot dot'.'
Simple but effective.

41:16.908 --> 41:19.709
He had a collection of business
cards from local restaurants

41:19.711 --> 41:21.678
he'd show to taxi drivers.

41:21.680 --> 41:24.881
On this particular day, we were
going to the German restaurant.

41:24.883 --> 41:27.550
He of course
immediately ordered a cocktail,

41:27.552 --> 41:29.152
which I had to confiscate.

41:30.221 --> 41:34.023
I always felt like a fuckin
cop when I was with that guy.

41:34.025 --> 41:37.861
It was normal for him to shut
down for a while after lunch.

41:37.863 --> 41:39.996
This he did
with much discomfort.

41:39.998 --> 41:42.866
After about an hour he'd bum
a smoke of some poor Chinese

41:42.868 --> 41:46.269
fellow and then we would get
back to the hospital and he'd go

41:46.271 --> 41:49.506
for a nap back in his room and
I'd continue working on my book

41:49.508 --> 41:51.508
back at the hotel.

41:51.510 --> 41:56.045
At night I'd come by for another
generous dose of Seinfeld.

41:56.047 --> 41:59.048
This routine would
repeat itself like clockwork.

42:00.184 --> 42:03.887
A week later my
wife arrived, thank god.

42:03.889 --> 42:05.722
I was already going nuts.

42:05.724 --> 42:08.525
Back at the hospital, i
continued to remove the cat from

42:08.527 --> 42:12.595
techno's room every day, 'what
the fuck.' Techno didn't know

42:12.597 --> 42:14.163
what was going on either.

42:15.566 --> 42:17.767
I brought techno
food every morning.

42:20.070 --> 42:24.040
He'd look at it and grimace and
say something like 'ah I can't

42:24.042 --> 42:26.876
eat that kind of lettuce' or
'i can't eat bananas without

42:26.878 --> 42:30.013
sprinkles on it' or
something retarded like that.

42:41.091 --> 42:43.026
And so it went...

42:43.028 --> 42:49.832
First it was Seinfeld, then
friends, then we discovered

42:49.834 --> 42:51.301
my name is Earl.

42:53.003 --> 42:55.638
Other than that,
there wasn't much to mark

42:55.640 --> 42:57.840
the passing of time.

42:57.842 --> 43:00.610
Techno had his good
days, and his bad days.

43:00.612 --> 43:03.746
He'd looked forward
to a special meal for days.

43:03.748 --> 43:07.083
Techno's immune system was so
low, a piece of fish that was

43:07.085 --> 43:10.787
slightly off or some other
funky food would put him down

43:10.789 --> 43:13.056
for a week or two.

43:13.058 --> 43:16.359
That was sad when
techno got sick like that.

43:16.361 --> 43:20.930
One day we were in his room
watching TV and he got up and

43:20.932 --> 43:23.866
hobbled to the
bathroom with the iv pole.

43:32.943 --> 43:35.979
When he got out he said 'look,
i dragged the iv pole to the

43:35.981 --> 43:39.382
bathroom and I wasn't even
hooked up to it.' We laughed

43:39.384 --> 43:41.851
until we cried.

43:41.853 --> 43:44.287
I think we were cracking up.

43:44.289 --> 43:47.290
Just then the door opened
and a hand dropped the cat

43:47.292 --> 43:49.859
back in the room.

43:49.861 --> 43:52.795
Things were getting
tense back in Vancouver.

43:54.031 --> 43:55.632
Techno and his
father were having a

43:55.634 --> 43:57.700
bitter dispute about money.

43:59.136 --> 44:03.339
I saw techno cry that day,
I'd never seen that before.

44:04.742 --> 44:07.944
Thank god flora was there to put
her arm around him, cos I didn't

44:07.946 --> 44:10.380
know what the hell to do.

44:17.921 --> 44:20.990
I was making great
progress with my book.

44:20.992 --> 44:23.092
I had no distractions in China.

44:24.729 --> 44:29.198
Sometimes techno would come
and visit me in the hotel room.

44:46.316 --> 44:48.317
After a while
he'd say something like

44:48.319 --> 44:51.354
'i gotta go take my pill' or 'i
gotta go get something from my

44:51.356 --> 44:56.826
room.' I'd give him
about five minutes and then

44:56.828 --> 44:59.028
I'd go chasing after him.

45:06.103 --> 45:10.440
I hated being a cop, but i
was actually pretty good at it.

45:10.442 --> 45:13.876
It wasn't hard to figure
out what techno was up to.

45:21.351 --> 45:22.885
God.

45:23.821 --> 45:25.922
And then more time passed.

45:27.958 --> 45:31.761
Except now,
it was the three of us.

45:33.130 --> 45:34.997
Three foreigners in China.

45:36.300 --> 45:39.235
We each brought something to
the table, but techno was the

45:39.237 --> 45:42.438
undisputed leader cos
he had the hospital address tied

45:42.440 --> 45:44.440
around his neck.

45:44.442 --> 45:47.844
Without that, we'd all be sunk.

45:47.846 --> 45:50.346
Occasionally a liver would come
in that matched techno's blood

45:50.348 --> 45:53.850
type, we were careful
not to get our hopes up.

45:53.852 --> 45:57.386
We weren't supposed to know this
but, the sad truth was techno

45:57.388 --> 46:01.190
was waiting for a liver
from some guy on death row.

46:01.192 --> 46:04.494
I asked techno what he thought
about some poor fellow dying

46:04.496 --> 46:06.529
so that he could live.

46:06.531 --> 46:10.133
'I don't care.'
Techno's favourite answer.

46:12.136 --> 46:14.403
Eventually a liver did come in.

46:15.873 --> 46:17.440
A real quality one too.

46:18.876 --> 46:22.145
Apparently, a fellow in his
early twenties was about to be

46:22.147 --> 46:26.449
executed and he had the
same blood type as techno.

46:26.451 --> 46:29.018
We couldn't help but
get our hopes up this time.

46:29.020 --> 46:32.121
Everything happened
really quickly after that.

46:32.123 --> 46:35.124
Techno was prepped for surgery
in the morning and then we

46:35.126 --> 46:37.226
wheeled him to the other
building where they perform the

46:37.228 --> 46:39.796
transplant surgeries.

46:39.798 --> 46:41.898
I remember looking at a pile
of rubbish in the corner of the

46:41.900 --> 46:46.002
elevator and thinking
how filthy this hospital was.

46:46.004 --> 46:48.971
I'd never seen techno so scared.

46:48.973 --> 46:53.075
The transplant ward had flickery
lights and holes in the ceiling,

46:53.077 --> 46:55.945
and then they wheeled him
off through the double doors

46:55.947 --> 46:57.513
and he was gone.

47:00.551 --> 47:03.119
Kung and I walked
back to the hotel.

47:03.121 --> 47:06.556
That dumb cat darted out
in front of us on the way back.

47:08.959 --> 47:11.294
We were called back
to return to the hospital.

47:12.896 --> 47:14.931
Dr Lee wanted to
show us techno's old liver

47:14.933 --> 47:17.033
for some reason.

47:17.035 --> 47:21.237
This infamous liver that's been
the source of so much grief, I

47:21.239 --> 47:23.873
had to take a look at it.

47:23.875 --> 47:27.210
A couple of days later we saw
techno in the isolation ward.

47:27.212 --> 47:29.946
He was behind glass
with some other patients.

47:29.948 --> 47:32.448
He had tubes running down his
mouth and he was hooked up to

47:32.450 --> 47:34.350
all sorts of machines.

47:34.352 --> 47:39.055
After a few more days,
he had moved into his own room.

47:40.290 --> 47:41.991
We had to wear hospital gowns,

47:41.993 --> 47:45.027
masks to avoid him
getting an infection.

47:45.029 --> 47:49.198
He jumped out of bed and shook
my hand, he was clearly pleased.

47:49.200 --> 47:51.968
And then he went over to
the TV and started adjusting

47:51.970 --> 47:53.269
the angle on it.

47:53.271 --> 47:57.340
The nurses were
chasing him around the room.

47:57.342 --> 48:00.042
He must've been high on drugs or
something cos he sure regretted

48:00.044 --> 48:01.611
doing that later.

48:04.548 --> 48:08.251
Rejection was a big
issue at this time.

48:08.253 --> 48:12.154
It was amazing to see the
transformation in him,

48:12.156 --> 48:14.023
and it happened so
quickly as well.

48:14.025 --> 48:16.025
First his eyeballs became white,

48:16.027 --> 48:18.928
and then his
thinking became clear again.

48:18.930 --> 48:23.299
Before the surgery it seemed
like he was always bogged down.

48:23.301 --> 48:25.635
It was an
awesome thing to watch.

48:25.637 --> 48:29.505
But, he still
couldn't leave his room.

48:29.507 --> 48:32.174
He had beaten the odds.

48:32.176 --> 48:35.411
One day I was in his
room, he was sleeping.

48:35.413 --> 48:38.247
He was chewing,
and putting handfuls of air

48:38.249 --> 48:40.182
in his mouth and chewing.

48:40.184 --> 48:43.920
He woke up and said 'ah man,
i was having this great dream

48:43.922 --> 48:47.423
about food.' I asked him on
another occasion 'what does it

48:47.425 --> 48:54.397
feel like to have a new liver?'
He said 'it feels, it feels like

48:54.399 --> 48:58.234
somebody removed a frozen
lasagne out of my chest and

48:58.236 --> 49:03.239
replaced it with another frozen
lasagne.' Now it was time to

49:03.241 --> 49:05.708
plan the exit strategy,
but first we had to

49:05.710 --> 49:07.310
pay off the hospital.

49:07.312 --> 49:09.979
For some reason the
hospital only took cash.

49:09.981 --> 49:12.048
Techno's father
had to organise a massive

49:12.050 --> 49:14.083
western union transfer.

49:14.085 --> 49:15.484
It was a big fuck up.

49:15.486 --> 49:19.188
Western union didn't
wanna transfer that much money.

49:19.190 --> 49:24.160
It took all day, but in the
end we had a big bag full of

49:24.162 --> 49:26.095
one hundred renminbi notes.

49:26.097 --> 49:28.631
It was a stack of
notes over two feet long.

49:28.633 --> 49:31.734
Me and two little
Asian girls were my backup.

49:35.038 --> 49:37.440
We returned to techno's room.

49:37.442 --> 49:40.343
First we wanted to take a
look at the piles of money,

49:40.345 --> 49:42.411
I could see techno's
eyes light up.

49:42.413 --> 49:45.314
For a moment I had second
thoughts about leaving all that

49:45.316 --> 49:47.149
money in his room.

49:47.151 --> 49:49.719
The next day was another
split second timing day.

49:49.721 --> 49:52.121
I had to collect the
money from techno's room.

49:52.123 --> 49:55.057
He was barking orders and being
rude to everyone, I stopped

49:55.059 --> 49:57.193
talking to him for a few hours.

49:57.195 --> 49:59.128
I had plenty of
other stuff I had to do.

49:59.130 --> 50:01.197
First I had to
go pay off dr Lee,

50:01.199 --> 50:03.399
then I had to rush
over and pay the hospital.

50:03.401 --> 50:06.635
Everything went perfectly
smooth, except one of the stacks

50:06.637 --> 50:11.207
of bills was short a
one hundred renminbi note.

50:11.209 --> 50:15.411
I made the difference with my
own money, then I rushed back.

50:15.413 --> 50:18.414
Dr Lee had to explain how all
the anti-rejection drugs had to

50:18.416 --> 50:21.317
be taken, all of
which was in mandarin.

50:23.053 --> 50:26.222
Then I had to rush back and
collect techno, who was having a

50:26.224 --> 50:28.357
smoke by the lobby.

50:28.359 --> 50:31.627
He had a surgical mask pulled
down, he was wearing his black

50:31.629 --> 50:36.165
cowboy hat and his white suit,
which was two sizes too big.

50:36.167 --> 50:39.602
I told him about the missing
note and he said 'yeah I know,

50:39.604 --> 50:41.237
cos I took it.'

50:42.406 --> 50:44.373
long pause...

50:46.643 --> 50:48.044
I was steaming.

50:48.046 --> 50:52.681
'Let me get this straight,
you stole a hundred renminbi,

50:52.683 --> 50:56.452
of your own money?'
Grabbed his cigarette, snuffed

50:56.454 --> 50:59.422
it out on the ground and then
we headed to the airport.

51:02.559 --> 51:05.761
First I had to see kung off,
and then techno and I had to

51:05.763 --> 51:08.230
get a plane to Hong Kong.

51:08.232 --> 51:11.801
And this is where the
story gets really fucked up.

51:11.803 --> 51:14.437
I'd over-stayed my
visa by a couple months,

51:14.439 --> 51:16.372
that's a big deal in China.

51:16.374 --> 51:20.376
This caused all sorts of
alarm bells to start ringing.

51:20.378 --> 51:22.244
Then they took
us to a holding room,

51:22.246 --> 51:25.314
we were about to
miss our connecting flight

51:25.316 --> 51:29.285
there was no way techno was
not going home on that flight,

51:29.287 --> 51:32.788
so I turned to him and I said
'you go, and I'll meet you

51:32.790 --> 51:35.591
in Hong Kong.' And that's
the second time I saw fear

51:35.593 --> 51:37.660
in techno's eyes.

51:37.662 --> 51:42.131
He nodded and then I had this
image in my head of him limping

51:42.133 --> 51:43.766
away from me towards the gate.

51:46.136 --> 51:50.139
Meanwhile, back in the holding
office another guy showed up.

51:50.141 --> 51:53.175
He said he needed money, he
made a space between his fingers

51:53.177 --> 51:55.144
about an inch and a half deep.

51:55.146 --> 51:58.547
Hell, I had a wad about 50
inches deep the day before.

51:58.549 --> 52:01.484
He had someone escort me to
a couple of atms and they

52:01.486 --> 52:04.520
shook me down for about
seven hundred us dollars.

52:04.522 --> 52:07.256
He was actually
a pretty nice guy.

52:07.258 --> 52:09.558
I was about one
hour behind techno.

52:09.560 --> 52:11.760
This is the first time
techno was unsupervised

52:11.762 --> 52:13.662
since he arrived in China.

52:13.664 --> 52:17.233
We were too close to
home to blow it now.

52:17.235 --> 52:20.202
I arrived in Hong Kong and
immediately scanned every bar

52:20.204 --> 52:22.571
and smoking room
all the way to the gate.

52:24.741 --> 52:28.644
I finally caught up to him at
gate one hundred and something.

52:28.646 --> 52:30.813
He didn't look so good.

52:30.815 --> 52:34.683
In fact, he never really
looked good again after that.

52:34.685 --> 52:37.319
He walked all the
way from gate five.

52:37.321 --> 52:39.421
I don't know why he
didn't get a wheelchair.

52:39.423 --> 52:42.458
At one point he sat down on a
bench that said 'wet paint.'

52:42.460 --> 52:45.494
he had black marks going across
the back of his white suit.

52:46.630 --> 52:49.431
We boarded the
flight to Vancouver.

52:49.433 --> 52:53.435
He had a business class
ticket and I was in coach,

52:53.437 --> 52:54.703
what the fuck?

52:58.708 --> 53:03.179
I could see the top of his
cowboy hat through the curtains.

53:03.181 --> 53:06.515
I called the flight attendant
aside and I said 'my friend

53:06.517 --> 53:09.351
cannot drink
under any circumstances.

53:09.353 --> 53:13.556
He's also very persuasive,
so don't be fooled.'

53:13.558 --> 53:15.658
I was totally acting
like a cop again.

53:18.728 --> 53:21.564
And at one point, techno
came back to coach

53:21.566 --> 53:23.666
and sat next to me
on the flight.

53:25.835 --> 53:29.205
He seemed so calm and
happy to be going home.

53:30.440 --> 53:34.310
I hadn't seen techno
this happy for a long time.

53:34.312 --> 53:36.779
With all the commotion
happening that day,

53:36.781 --> 53:40.449
I can't remember if he took
his anti-rejection pills.

53:40.451 --> 53:42.551
He was supposed
to take them twice.

53:44.854 --> 53:47.957
This next part of the
story is a little hard to tell.

53:47.959 --> 53:52.328
It seemed like we had finally
got home after this huge ordeal,

53:52.330 --> 53:54.463
and I handed
techno off to his folks.

53:56.399 --> 53:58.500
I sorta thought I needed
some time away from techno

53:58.502 --> 53:59.802
for a while.

54:02.772 --> 54:07.376
That night, techno made a turn
for the worse, and went into

54:07.378 --> 54:11.647
pure rejection mode,
and began to turn yellow again.

54:11.649 --> 54:14.984
He was rushed to the
Vancouver general hospital.

54:14.986 --> 54:17.019
Over the course of
time his situation went

54:17.021 --> 54:18.520
from bad to worse.

54:20.323 --> 54:22.524
I couldn't believe it
when I heard the news

54:22.526 --> 54:24.493
that techno had died.

54:28.265 --> 54:30.966
Techno was convinced
that nothing could kill him.

54:30.968 --> 54:35.371
The truth is, is that by this
time, there really wasn't much

54:35.373 --> 54:36.839
keeping techno alive.

54:40.410 --> 54:42.845
His ashes were gonna be
distributed out at the cliff

54:42.847 --> 54:45.914
where he used to dive
off of at lighthouse park.

54:45.916 --> 54:49.752
His father said a few words
and distributed his ashes.

54:49.754 --> 54:52.554
Just then a big gust of wind
came and picked up that big

54:52.556 --> 54:55.724
cloud of ash and blew it towards
this group that was about a

54:55.726 --> 54:59.461
hundred yards downwind from us,
and they completely got dusted

54:59.463 --> 55:01.030
with techno's ashes.

55:01.032 --> 55:04.600
And his dad said,
kinda comically,

55:04.602 --> 55:11.707
'son, even in death you're
still giving me troubles.'

01:02:04.754 --> 01:02:05.854
Max

01:02:06.089 --> 01:02:07.155
Max?

01:02:07.157 --> 01:02:08.356
Max?

01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:13.929
Max!

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:16.832
Max?!

01:02:17.467 --> 01:02:18.934
Mmh...It's him!

01:11:32.755 --> 01:11:36.024
Today's my
birthday and I'm treating myself

01:11:36.026 --> 01:11:39.494
to a trip to the seaside,
as I do every year.

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:44.299
I love sitting down
to a meal of fresh grilled fish

01:11:44.566 --> 01:11:46.668
with a little glass
of white wine,

01:11:46.869 --> 01:11:51.339
overlooking the wide empty
beaches of the north coast.

01:11:57.346 --> 01:12:01.382
Rats! There's that crackpot
from the retirement home again.

01:12:05.587 --> 01:12:09.424
She came for me this morning.
She called me "mom."

01:12:09.426 --> 01:12:11.592
She's clearly out to lunch.

01:12:11.794 --> 01:12:14.529
"She'll take you to the seaside,
madame Jacqueline,

01:12:14.531 --> 01:12:17.765
don't you worry!" They
told me at the retirement home.

01:12:17.767 --> 01:12:19.801
Well, I do worry!

01:12:19.803 --> 01:12:23.071
She's quite terrifying with
her big staring eyes

01:12:23.073 --> 01:12:24.038
like a Halibut!

01:13:02.611 --> 01:13:05.813
I can take the train on my own;
I'm not a child!

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:14.889
And I don't fancy
traveling with a lunatic.

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:29.904
That chicken reminds me
of a story.

01:13:33.175 --> 01:13:35.877
The day my poppa brought
home a chicken.

01:13:35.879 --> 01:13:37.712
He had chopped off its head

01:13:37.714 --> 01:13:40.448
but the creature refused to die.

01:13:40.849 --> 01:13:44.652
Far from being resentful, it
took quite a shine to my father,

01:13:44.654 --> 01:13:46.788
who ended adopting it.

01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:51.459
The creature followed him
everywhere, like a dog,

01:13:52.027 --> 01:13:56.497
even to the factory. He was
the star of the neighborhood.

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:00.034
What was its name again?

01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:03.938
Anyway, one day the cat got him.

01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:08.142
My father was inconsolable.

01:14:08.844 --> 01:14:10.678
He shut himself in the kitchen

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:13.781
and chopped the heads off
chickens for two days straight,

01:14:13.783 --> 01:14:17.151
hoping the miracle
would happen again.

01:14:55.792 --> 01:14:57.825
I can't wait to see the sea.

01:14:58.994 --> 01:15:01.996
I used to bring my little girl
with me back in the day.

01:15:03.031 --> 01:15:05.066
Oh, I'd love some fish!

01:15:06.835 --> 01:15:08.903
I'll have to remember
to ask my grandmother

01:15:08.905 --> 01:15:11.172
for her recipe for Dover sole.

01:15:52.314 --> 01:15:54.048
The lunatic!

01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:55.616
She found me!

01:15:56.251 --> 01:15:58.052
What a nuisance she is!

01:15:59.154 --> 01:16:00.788
My head?!

01:16:01.924 --> 01:16:04.292
Oh, no! What have I done
with my head?

01:16:07.262 --> 01:16:09.130
- Mom, what's wrong?

01:16:09.132 --> 01:16:11.032
There she goes
again, calling me "mom!"

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:12.934
Honestly!

01:16:39.061 --> 01:16:40.795
My head!

01:18:38.013 --> 01:18:40.281
- Mom...

01:18:40.283 --> 01:18:43.984
How are you doing?

01:18:43.986 --> 01:18:46.854
- I'm fine, dear.

01:18:46.856 --> 01:18:49.957
I'm just fine.

01:26:46.334 --> 01:26:48.435
Marcus: What... what the?!

01:26:55.376 --> 01:26:56.944
Noé: Er, ugh, major

01:26:57.745 --> 01:26:59.246
Marcus: What is that?

01:27:00.515 --> 01:27:00.514
Noé: What are we gonna do?

01:27:03.351 --> 01:27:03.984
Marcus: I haven't come two
million klicks eating steak

01:27:03.986 --> 01:27:07.588
pills to get kicked out
just arriving ok? Let's go!

01:27:07.755 --> 01:27:09.856
Noé: Wait
it could be dangerous!

01:27:10.291 --> 01:27:12.259
Marcus: Don't worry,
we're just gonna talk.

01:27:12.261 --> 01:27:14.728
Noé: Ow, I don't like
it when you get political.

01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:19.333
Marcus: Gentlemen, would you
be kind enough to vacate the

01:27:19.335 --> 01:27:23.503
premises so we may properly
finish our mission of creating

01:27:23.505 --> 01:27:26.540
a new peaceful era
for the human race.

01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:34.248
Noé: Simpler, major, simpler!

01:27:34.250 --> 01:27:36.717
They don't
seem to understand

01:27:38.419 --> 01:27:41.755
Marcus: Us here, you get out!

01:27:45.727 --> 01:27:48.695
Marcus: Move or I'll
kick your sick alien ass out!!

01:27:48.697 --> 01:27:48.829
Noe: Ah major?

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.534
Marcus: It's crazy how much
time you lose with formalities!
