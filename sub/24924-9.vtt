00:06.380 --> 00:08.541
[theme music playing]

00:28.980 --> 00:30.277
My name is Kevin Porter.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.312
I'm a guidance counselor
at Liberty High School.

00:37.910 --> 00:40.231
I would say I help as many kids as I can.

00:42.370 --> 00:44.076
That's why I got into education.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.956
But I don't get to see every kid.

00:49.670 --> 00:51.160
I try to keep an eye out,

00:51.250 --> 00:53.718
but you have to count on kids
to come to you.

00:55.130 --> 01:00.215
And not every kid who does come to you
is able to ask for the help they need.

01:01.810 --> 01:04.131
Not every kid tells you the whole truth.

01:07.980 --> 01:09.470
[Hannah on recording] We all need it.

01:10.150 --> 01:11.185
Human contact.

01:11.730 --> 01:15.769
And communications class,
crazy as it was, was human contact for me.

01:16.860 --> 01:19.158
Until someone_in _that class
cut my lifeline.

01:19.700 --> 01:21.577
Someone who was known for being sweet.

01:22.540 --> 01:25.327
I'll tell you who it is,
but you're going to have to wait.

01:26.500 --> 01:27.615
-Just like I did.
-Hey.

01:27.710 --> 01:28.529
[Mrs. Bradley] Oh!

01:29.630 --> 01:30.449
Kevin.

01:30.750 --> 01:33.207
Uh, what are you doing here on a Sunday?

01:33.300 --> 01:35.256
I should be asking you the same question.

01:35.670 --> 01:37.626
I thought I'd have the place to myself.

01:38.010 --> 01:40.387
Well, they bumped me up.

01:40.550 --> 01:42.347
I testify first thing in the morning.

01:42.430 --> 01:44.091
Wow. Me, too.

01:44.640 --> 01:46.267
So, I guess I go after you?

01:46.350 --> 01:47.180
Oh.

01:47.810 --> 01:49.095
So, what's this about?

01:51.650 --> 01:53.777
I couldn't listen
when they first came out.

01:54.690 --> 01:55.850
But now I just...

01:57.780 --> 01:58.940
can't stop listening.

01:59.780 --> 02:00.610
Ah.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.236
-So you're here preparing?
-Yeah.

02:05.660 --> 02:06.695
Isn't that why you're here?

02:07.870 --> 02:10.873
I sat down, you know, with the lavwers.
I know what to say.

02:11.420 --> 02:12.956
We followed protocol.

02:13.040 --> 02:16.703
We did all we could for Hannah
with the information that we had.

02:17.840 --> 02:21.924
I sat down with them, too,
and I feel like it's true.

02:26.020 --> 02:30.184
Well... but the world is not listening
to a recording of your class.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.476
They're not gonna play the tape
in court, though.

02:35.650 --> 02:36.856
That's what the lawyers say.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.986
But they know what's on it,
and they know what happened.

02:42.240 --> 02:43.650
But you know what was in your heart.

02:44.660 --> 02:46.150
She couldn't tell you what she needed.

02:46.700 --> 02:47.746
You did your best.

02:49.790 --> 02:50.609
Did I?

02:56.050 --> 02:58.041
[students chattering]

03:07.680 --> 03:12.265
[Kevin] Not every kid who comes to you
in pain can tell you where it hurts.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.719
[Hannah] I need it to stop.

03:15.020 --> 03:16.476
[Kevin] You need what to stop?

03:17.400 --> 03:20.233
[Hannah crying] I need everything to stop.

03:21.950 --> 03:25.192
Just, people, life.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.442
What did you mean when you said
you needed life to stop?

03:30.000 --> 03:30.819
I don't know.

03:31.370 --> 03:34.123
_ 'Cause that seems
like a very serious thing to say.

03:34.500 --> 03:35.410
I know. I...

03:36.210 --> 03:38.758
I'm sorry. I didn't mean... that.

03:41.380 --> 03:43.041
[Kevin] She said she didn't mean it.

03:44.010 --> 03:45.921
I made the mistake of believing her.

03:51.770 --> 03:53.840
Hannah told me she was struggling,

03:53.940 --> 03:56.477
but she didn't specifically
mention suicide.

03:56.560 --> 03:58.141
[Hannah] I just need everything to stop.

03:58.610 --> 04:00.180
What do you need to stop, Hannah?

04:00.780 --> 04:02.771
Do I really need to spell it out for you?

04:04.700 --> 04:06.691
I'm thinking about killing myself.

04:07.780 --> 04:09.577
[Kevin] If she had said those words,

04:10.080 --> 04:11.866
of course I would have taken action.

04:12.080 --> 04:14.537
Did you have an encounter at the party?

04:15.920 --> 04:16.909
An encounter?

04:18.960 --> 04:21.417
Yeah. You could say that.

04:21.510 --> 04:23.125
Did he force himself on you?

04:24.800 --> 04:25.630
I think so.

04:25.970 --> 04:28.211
You think so, but you're not sure?

04:29.850 --> 04:31.340
Did you tell him to stop?

04:32.890 --> 04:33.720
No.

04:34.140 --> 04:35.220
Did you tell him "no"?

04:38.440 --> 04:39.259
No.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.686
Maybe you consented,
then changed your mind.

04:41.780 --> 04:43.179
No, it's not like that.

04:44.990 --> 04:47.117
Should we involve your parents
or the police?

04:47.200 --> 04:48.019
No!

04:51.160 --> 04:52.320
Hannah, who's the boy?

04:54.830 --> 04:56.036
[phone rings]

04:56.290 --> 04:59.168
[Kevin] I think we all wish
it could have gone differently.

05:00.460 --> 05:01.449
What happened, Hannah?

05:03.880 --> 05:06.337
I got into a hot tub with Bryce Walker...

05:12.020 --> 05:13.464
and then he raped me.

05:18.690 --> 05:21.978
[Kevin] We can have the best intentions
and still fall short.

05:31.280 --> 05:34.329
No Justin this morning?
He's usually the first one up.

05:35.250 --> 05:36.069
He's...

05:37.040 --> 05:38.280
not our problem anymore.

05:39.750 --> 05:41.786
What does that mean, he's not our problem?

05:45.090 --> 05:46.546
It means he's gone.

05:48.220 --> 05:49.039
He took off.

05:50.340 --> 05:53.252
-Did you try calling him?
-He doesn't have a phone.

05:53.810 --> 05:55.926
Your mother gave him one
on the family plan.

05:56.020 --> 05:56.839
[scoffs]

05:57.440 --> 05:59.806
-Of course she did.
-Well, we should call him.

06:01.230 --> 06:04.188
I don't know his number. I imagine
the phone company will have it.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.269
Jesus, why do you care?

06:05.940 --> 06:07.237
He had a bed, he had food,

06:07.320 --> 06:10.153
he had new clothes,
and a new phone, apparently,

06:10.410 --> 06:11.695
and he didn't want any of it.

06:12.280 --> 06:14.908
-So why don't we just let him go?
-Clay, what's this about?

06:16.080 --> 06:17.536
He's scheduled to testify on Monday,

06:17.620 --> 06:19.918
and that was so important to you,
you smuggled him in here.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.069
Where's Mom?

06:22.340 --> 06:26.413
Your mother and I had a...
disagreement last night.

06:26.510 --> 06:27.579
Yeah, I was there.

06:27.670 --> 06:30.924
And she's staying with her sister
for a few days.

06:31.010 --> 06:31.829
Why?

06:31.930 --> 06:34.808
Oh, just to give us both time
to figure things out.

06:36.060 --> 06:39.018
The past few weeks have been stressful
around here for all of us.

06:39.390 --> 06:40.379
Let's move.

06:41.730 --> 06:43.812
Start over somewhere,
just you and me.

06:44.230 --> 06:46.278
Clay, it's-- It's not permanent.

06:46.360 --> 06:49.397
-Your mom and I are just cooling off.
-I don't care. I don't...

06:50.860 --> 06:52.657
ever wanna go to that school again.

06:54.030 --> 06:55.156
Look, everybody hates me there.

06:55.450 --> 06:58.328
Someone online called me a murderer
because I was on Hannah's tapes.

06:58.620 --> 07:01.828
-Why do you read what people say online?
-[phone buzzes]

07:02.580 --> 07:03.626
Let's move.

07:04.540 --> 07:05.791
-Anywhere.
-Clay.

07:07.300 --> 07:10.007
_This is our home. _
All right? This is our family.

07:11.050 --> 07:12.256
We've made a bit of a mess.

07:13.590 --> 07:15.137
But nothing's broken we can't fix.

07:16.220 --> 07:17.175
Everything's broken.

07:20.270 --> 07:22.147
And I don't think any of it can be fixed.

07:24.730 --> 07:26.686
[Kevin] Some kids can't speak their truth.

07:27.480 --> 07:28.390
Some won't.

07:28.900 --> 07:31.232
To us, to their families...

07:32.990 --> 07:34.230
We can go ahead and eat.

07:34.740 --> 07:38.232
It's Sunday morning. There's no hurry.
We'll wait for our guest.

07:38.330 --> 07:41.072
[Bryce] She said 10:00 was fine,
so I don't know what's going on.

07:42.710 --> 07:45.702
[Nora] Was this before or after
the ribbon cutting ceremony?

07:46.130 --> 07:48.951
I mean, I invited her yesterday at school.

07:49.050 --> 07:51.336
And did she confirm?
She might not know to confirm.

07:51.800 --> 07:55.509
Not everyone has a grandmother like yours,
wielding Emily Post like a bible.

07:56.010 --> 07:59.264
-She knows things like that.
-Well, then, I wonder what's keeping her.

08:01.180 --> 08:04.513
Did the two of you
discuss the ceremony at all?

08:04.600 --> 08:06.306
No, Chle doesn't care about that stuff.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.221
[sighs] I'll just...
I'm gonna try her again.

08:15.280 --> 08:16.611
[Barry] What are you doing?

08:18.370 --> 08:20.406
-I don't know what you mean.
-You know exactly what I mean.

08:20.700 --> 08:21.780
Leave the boy alone.

08:22.830 --> 08:25.742
Can you honestly say
you recognize the person on that tape?

08:26.710 --> 08:29.918
Have you ever said anything
even remotely resembling the filth

08:30.000 --> 08:31.297
that came out of his mouth?

08:31.380 --> 08:33.416
It was a setup. He was drunk.

08:33.800 --> 08:35.210
That was not our son talking.

08:35.300 --> 08:37.928
You're his mother, for Christ's sake.
You raised him.

08:41.890 --> 08:44.939
[Bryce] She's still not picking up.
Let's just eat, I guess.

08:45.980 --> 08:46.799
Marisa?

08:47.770 --> 08:48.896
If you would, please.

08:53.570 --> 08:56.653
Son, if something's not right with Chle,
you need to make it right.

08:58.280 --> 08:59.156
Do you understand?

09:01.290 --> 09:02.405
Yeah, Dad.

09:02.660 --> 09:05.993
A woman who loves you is to be respected

09:07.000 --> 09:08.126
and not to be crossed.

09:16.720 --> 09:19.678
[Kevin] And some kids have secrets
they believe they have to keep

09:20.600 --> 09:21.885
for their own survival.

09:24.180 --> 09:26.228
[Caleb] You can't hide in this town
with that car.

09:27.060 --> 09:29.051
-Hey.
-Hey? That's what I get?

09:29.610 --> 09:31.009
You're sitting when you should be boxing.

09:31.520 --> 09:33.897
I can't always find someone
to fill a Saturday session last-minute.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.060
Yeah, I'm sorry, okay?
There's a lot going on.

09:37.450 --> 09:38.565
Yeah. Yeah, clearly.

09:39.240 --> 09:40.446
You wanna tell me about Lucas?

09:42.030 --> 09:43.907
-Who?
-Lucas.

09:44.120 --> 09:46.748
You met him last night, you got weird,
and then you bailed.

09:46.830 --> 09:50.209
-Then this morning, you didn't show up.
-It's got nothing to do with Lucas, okay?

09:50.290 --> 09:51.370
It's the trial.

09:51.630 --> 09:53.086
And now these tapes.

09:53.380 --> 09:54.290
Yeah, that's some shit.

09:54.380 --> 09:58.874
And I've never lost a friend like that,
but if you wanna talk about it...

10:01.010 --> 10:05.344
I'm not going to be right
until after I testify.

10:06.060 --> 10:07.846
And I shouldn't have left you hanging.

10:07.940 --> 10:10.647
I didn't want to make my drama yours.

10:10.940 --> 10:11.804
And...

10:13.860 --> 10:14.679
I'm sorry.

10:15.860 --> 10:17.100
Now, was that so hard?

10:17.190 --> 10:20.944
-Oh, fuck you. Yes, actually. Yes.
-[Caleb laughing]

10:21.530 --> 10:22.770
Wanna take your mind off it all

10:22.870 --> 10:24.735
and watch Madrid destroy Barcelona
Monday night?

10:25.660 --> 10:27.400
What makes you think I like soccer?

10:27.710 --> 10:30.076
You're Mexican and you're gay.
How could you not like soccer?

10:32.210 --> 10:33.746
Yeah, okay.

10:34.670 --> 10:35.489
It's a date.

10:35.590 --> 10:37.330
[soft rock song plays]

10:37.420 --> 10:38.250
[chuckles]

10:39.010 --> 10:41.422
[Kevin] And we may think
we know what they're going through,

10:42.640 --> 10:44.130
but each kid goes through it...

10:45.930 --> 10:47.090
in their own way.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.842
Hi. Um, can I please have a large Coke

10:50.100 --> 10:53.934
and a medium popcorn,
uh, with butter only on half?

10:54.770 --> 10:56.522
But not the bottom half.

10:56.610 --> 10:58.566
Like, fill it up normally

10:58.650 --> 11:01.448
and then carefully put butter
only on the left half.

11:03.910 --> 11:07.073
[stammering]
It's very important. Just half.

11:10.120 --> 11:11.417
I'll have the same thing, please.

11:17.420 --> 11:19.502
[indistinct chatter on film]

11:27.010 --> 11:29.592
So I came back home

11:30.810 --> 11:33.267
To get cleaned
And to clear my head

11:34.230 --> 11:37.779
But there was still a chill
In my bones

11:38.360 --> 11:41.739
Even in the ground below
It started shaking

11:41.820 --> 11:45.369
Oh, I can't change
What already happened

11:46.370 --> 11:49.407
I can only control how I react

11:50.250 --> 11:53.287
I don't know, for all I know

11:53.370 --> 11:57.124
Maybe, maybe
Yeah, it already happened again

11:59.510 --> 12:02.126
Sometimes I wonder
If you're better off

12:03.130 --> 12:06.042
Sometimes I wonder
If you're better off

12:07.140 --> 12:09.552
Sometimes I wonder
If you're better off

12:12.350 --> 12:14.011
Without me

12:14.100 --> 12:15.761
[Tyler breathing heavily]

12:17.860 --> 12:19.316
[Tyler groaning]

12:20.230 --> 12:21.276
What's wrong?

12:22.610 --> 12:24.350
-Sorry, bathroom.
-Wait, Tyler.

12:29.240 --> 12:32.118
Sometimes I wonder
If you're better off

12:33.830 --> 12:35.115
[Tyler whispers] Oh, fuck!

12:35.580 --> 12:36.535
Oh, shit.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.742
[Kevin] And so they think
they're the only person in the world

12:39.840 --> 12:43.753
feeling what they're feeling,
and that no one could possibly understand.

12:44.010 --> 12:45.170
[keep case opens]

12:50.430 --> 12:52.341
[game chimes]

12:54.640 --> 12:55.470
[button clicks]

12:57.730 --> 12:58.970

12:59.060 --> 13:01.028

13:03.610 --> 13:05.020
-[automatic gunfire]
-[man 2 groans]

13:05.110 --> 13:05.986
Go, go!

13:06.780 --> 13:07.610
Reload!

13:08.780 --> 13:10.270
-[automatic gunfire]
-[man 1] Grenade!

13:11.370 --> 13:12.780
Move on, move on.

13:13.330 --> 13:14.365
[man 2 screams]

13:15.460 --> 13:16.529
[screams]

13:17.750 --> 13:18.910
[men groaning]

13:19.000 --> 13:22.504
[Kevin] They think that what's hurting
can never be healed.

13:27.050 --> 13:28.586
So they don't tell us.

13:28.840 --> 13:30.671
They hide, they deflect.

13:31.390 --> 13:34.097
They try to become the person
they think we want to see.

13:35.890 --> 13:37.266
[door opens]

13:40.520 --> 13:43.102
-[TV turns on]
-Hey, baby. You want some lunch?

13:44.400 --> 13:45.480
Isn't it, like, 10:00?

13:45.950 --> 13:47.520
Uh, dinner, then?

13:47.610 --> 13:49.362
I can-- I can make you something.

13:50.780 --> 13:52.486
Yeah, well, there's hardly anything left.

13:52.580 --> 13:54.650
-We ate most of the groceries yesterday.
-[TV turns off]

13:55.660 --> 13:58.072
I forgot how much a growing boy can eat.

13:59.290 --> 14:04.250
Yeah. There's also only so many
actual groceries at 7-Eleven.

14:04.340 --> 14:05.375
Look at you.

14:06.630 --> 14:07.676
You're taller.

14:08.880 --> 14:09.710
I'm not.

14:10.970 --> 14:12.961
I basically shrunk on the streets.

14:13.430 --> 14:17.059
Well, you're still my big,
tall, handsome boy.

14:19.270 --> 14:20.225
I missed you.

14:22.610 --> 14:23.679
I missed you, too, Mom.

14:29.490 --> 14:30.400
It's-- It's nothing.

14:30.490 --> 14:33.573
What'd you get into out there?
I never wanted this life for you.

14:33.660 --> 14:35.696
-I know.
-You don't deserve that life.

14:35.790 --> 14:36.609
Nobody does.

14:37.080 --> 14:38.741
Then why are you still with Seth?

14:39.540 --> 14:40.871
[sighs] Baby...

14:42.590 --> 14:43.488
He loves me.

14:44.170 --> 14:47.799
[stammering] Come on, okay?
We can find a new place.

14:47.880 --> 14:49.928
We-- We can get the fuck out of here.

14:51.090 --> 14:52.717
I can't, baby, you know that.

14:54.260 --> 14:55.500
And I need you here.

14:57.220 --> 14:59.347
Promise me you'll stay this time.

15:01.480 --> 15:02.344
Yeah, yeah.

15:04.110 --> 15:05.065
I promise.

15:10.490 --> 15:13.152
[Kevin on recording] If you don't want
to press charges against this boy,

15:13.240 --> 15:15.572
if you're not even sure
you can press charges,

15:16.830 --> 15:19.742
then there really is only one option.

15:20.870 --> 15:22.076
[Hannah on recording] What is it?

15:23.380 --> 15:26.952
[Kevin] I'm not trying to be blunt here,
Hannah, but you can move on.

15:48.820 --> 15:52.449
[Kevin] And for many kids,
trust doesn't come easy.

15:53.450 --> 15:56.078
Trusting an adult
with something so personal...

15:56.870 --> 15:58.781
I can understand her silence.

16:01.620 --> 16:02.609
Hey, buddy.

16:03.960 --> 16:06.201
Listen, it's been a while since we talked.

16:07.130 --> 16:09.792
I know I beat the shit out of you,
and I'm sorry about that,

16:09.880 --> 16:12.212
but I got no beef with you, really.

16:13.510 --> 16:14.670
We're not enemies.

16:15.550 --> 16:18.678
So just mind your business...

16:19.600 --> 16:21.477
and I'll take care of mine, okay?

16:22.940 --> 16:24.339
Get your hands off me.

16:25.440 --> 16:27.010
Watch your fucking tone.

16:28.150 --> 16:31.438
And, you know, watch yourself.

16:33.070 --> 16:35.311
I don't know how you got to Marcus,
but this shit--

16:35.410 --> 16:36.650
[Mrs. Childs] Mr. Jensen.

16:38.030 --> 16:40.328
Principal Bolan
would like to see you, now.

16:43.540 --> 16:46.418
[Kevin] I can understand
why she couldn't say those words to me.

16:48.750 --> 16:50.490
[Dennis] Did you attempt to find
who had written that?

16:50.750 --> 16:54.425
Yes. I told my students that
I was available if they needed to talk.

16:54.510 --> 16:55.750
Were their parents notified?

16:56.930 --> 16:59.421
No, I wanted my class to be a safe place

16:59.510 --> 17:02.308
where students could share
without fear of punishment,

17:02.390 --> 17:06.474
so, um, I didn't involve their parents.
That would've broken their trust.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.767
Did you take any action
outside of discussion

17:08.860 --> 17:12.478
to help this student who was clearly
crying out to you for help?

17:12.690 --> 17:15.352
Yes, I offered resources,

17:15.450 --> 17:18.237
including phone numbers
for crisis hotlines.

17:18.320 --> 17:20.902
So you told them to look somewhere else
for help, is that right?

17:20.990 --> 17:25.279
I made available every resource
that I could, including my time.

17:25.830 --> 17:26.660
No further questions.

17:27.620 --> 17:31.295
[Sonya] Mrs. Bradley,
your class submissions are anonymous

17:31.380 --> 17:33.621
because that fosters honesty.

17:33.880 --> 17:35.370
-Isn't that correct?
-Yes.

17:35.470 --> 17:38.633
Um, I wanted every student
to feel comfortable,

17:38.720 --> 17:41.257
so I made the submissions anonymous.

17:41.350 --> 17:44.558
And is it fair to say
that if you had notified their parents

17:44.640 --> 17:47.689
that your students might have stopped
making submissions?

17:47.770 --> 17:48.646
Yes.

17:48.730 --> 17:50.937
Trust is everything with kids.

17:51.020 --> 17:55.354
They're very hesitant to give it
and very quick to take it back.

17:55.690 --> 17:57.317
Was this the only student

17:57.400 --> 18:00.779
whose writing suggested emotional distress
last semester?

18:01.530 --> 18:03.282
No. It happens a lot.

18:03.370 --> 18:07.784
[Sonya] And isn't it true that you did
offer resources to students in need?

18:07.870 --> 18:10.953
Yes. I brought it up every day in class
for weeks.

18:11.040 --> 18:14.544
So wouldn't you say it's pretty clear
Hannah didn't want to be identified?

18:14.630 --> 18:16.257
Objection. Calls for speculation.

18:16.670 --> 18:17.500
[judge] Sustained.

18:17.840 --> 18:20.252
[Sonya] Hannah chose
not to identify herself

18:20.340 --> 18:23.503
and accept your offers
for additional resources.

18:23.760 --> 18:25.307
-True?
-True.

18:25.640 --> 18:29.474
Um, teenagers often don't know
what help they need,

18:29.560 --> 18:30.970
much less how to ask for it.

18:32.650 --> 18:34.060
[Sonya] No further questions.

18:34.860 --> 18:36.350
[Bolan] I left a message with your mother

18:37.280 --> 18:39.601
about your unexcused absence on Friday.

18:41.030 --> 18:44.238
-My mother doesn't live with us anymore.
-Oh? Hence the absence?

18:45.830 --> 18:48.902
-Uh, no. I took a mental health day.
-Oh, I see.

18:49.790 --> 18:52.918
The same day Hannah Baker's tapes
were posted online.

18:54.670 --> 18:55.659
Hmm? Come on.

18:55.920 --> 18:57.876
You're telling me
those two things are unrelated?

18:57.970 --> 19:00.211
My girlfriend
is in a psychiatric hospital.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.131
-I went to visit her.
-Was the Vi5it prearranged?

19:03.220 --> 19:04.130
It was with her.

19:04.220 --> 19:07.678
All right, Clay, you know what?
I don't have a lot of patience these days.

19:08.140 --> 19:11.439
So let's talk about the real issue here.

19:12.270 --> 19:14.226
You're acting out, and I need to know why.

19:14.310 --> 19:15.516
I need to know what you need

19:15.610 --> 19:18.397
because I don't wanna see
somebody getting hurt with this.

19:18.610 --> 19:20.487
Somebody already has gotten hurt.

19:23.320 --> 19:25.072
Suicide contagion is a real thing,

19:25.160 --> 19:28.152
and we've got to take measures
to protect you kids.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.457
I don't understand.
How does silence protect us?

19:30.540 --> 19:33.919
Kids get talking about Hannah,
maybe even admiring what she did,

19:34.000 --> 19:36.491
they might think somehow
that this is an answer.

19:37.090 --> 19:39.877
It might be a way
for other kids to feel their pain,

19:40.590 --> 19:43.252
that they could live on after they die.

19:43.340 --> 19:44.887
Where on her tapes does Hannah say that?

19:44.970 --> 19:48.303
Well, whoever posted her tapes online
seems to believe exactly that,

19:48.390 --> 19:50.096
that her story should go on forever.

19:50.430 --> 19:52.057
Maybe they just wanted
to start a conversation.

19:52.270 --> 19:54.340
We weren't talking about these things
before Hannah.

19:54.440 --> 19:55.475
Of course we were.

19:55.560 --> 19:57.972
In counseling sessions,
in health classes.

19:58.070 --> 19:59.776
That's not talking, that's telling.

19:59.860 --> 20:00.679
Clay...

20:01.490 --> 20:02.730
[sighs]

20:04.110 --> 20:04.940
All right.

20:05.950 --> 20:09.909
I know you think that I'm the bad guy
in this whole story.

20:10.450 --> 20:12.532
But I've been educating kids for 30 years,

20:12.620 --> 20:16.659
and the most important thing to me
is keeping you safe, keeping you alive.

20:17.210 --> 20:18.245
I'm alive.

20:18.340 --> 20:21.719
And the most dangerous thing
would be to believe somehow

20:21.800 --> 20:26.965
that Hannah's suicide
is more than a tragic death.

20:27.720 --> 20:31.019
She's not a hero.
She does not have lessons to teach us.

20:31.100 --> 20:34.888
And we need to recognize
the sad and simple truth

20:34.980 --> 20:38.017
that she is dead and gone forever.

20:41.530 --> 20:42.599
I recognize that.

20:43.530 --> 20:45.066
No, I don't think you really do.

20:47.570 --> 20:49.731
Which is why I'm recommending
a schedule change.

20:49.910 --> 20:53.118
You'll be taking Alternative Strategies
and Solutions.

20:58.210 --> 20:59.871
-As punishment.
-No.

20:59.960 --> 21:02.201
To help you find ways of coping
with what you're feeling.

21:05.260 --> 21:06.545
[paper rustles]

21:12.060 --> 21:14.176
Have you even listened to them?
The tapes?

21:16.020 --> 21:16.839
No.

21:16.940 --> 21:19.761
I was made aware of them by Mr. Porter,

21:19.860 --> 21:22.727
but we brought them
directly to our attorneys.

21:24.070 --> 21:25.059
I didn't listen to them.

21:27.570 --> 21:28.446
Maybe you should.

21:33.120 --> 21:36.704
[Dennis] So, after you let her leave
your office, what was your follow-up?

21:37.960 --> 21:38.949
[Kevin sighs]

21:39.210 --> 21:41.246
I didn't let her leave. She walked out.

21:42.300 --> 21:45.292
I asked her to come back,
to sit down, and she didn't.

21:45.510 --> 21:48.047
-How do you keep your appointments?
-In a schedule book.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.334
Do you recognize this book?

21:49.760 --> 21:51.136
Yes. It's mine.

21:51.220 --> 21:52.847
Submitted as exhibit 17, Your Honor.

21:52.930 --> 21:55.387
Mr. Porter, did you log
your meeting with Hannah?

21:55.480 --> 21:57.471
Uh, yes, I believe so.

21:57.560 --> 22:01.519
But the page corresponding to that date,
October 9th, 2017, is missing.

22:01.940 --> 22:03.680
Did you rip that page out of the book?

22:06.280 --> 22:07.440
-I did.
-Are you in the habit

22:07.530 --> 22:09.236
of ripping pages
out of your schedule book?

22:09.870 --> 22:11.110
I... [sighs]

22:11.910 --> 22:17.576
Look, there was a lot of confusion
going around at that time,

22:17.660 --> 22:19.491
after I found out what Hannah had done.

22:19.710 --> 22:22.873
[Dennis] Earlier, you testified
that Hannah came to you with an incident,

22:22.960 --> 22:24.245
but she wasn't specific.

22:24.340 --> 22:25.659
What did she say about it?

22:26.130 --> 22:28.542
She said it happened at a party.

22:29.470 --> 22:31.210
An encounter with a boy.

22:31.300 --> 22:33.552
Did she say anything
about the nature of that encounter?

22:33.890 --> 22:35.300
She implied that it was intimate.

22:35.390 --> 22:38.473
Was it your impression,
based on that conversation, Mr. Porter,

22:39.270 --> 22:42.353
that Hannah Baker had been raped
by a student at Liberty High?

22:42.440 --> 22:45.352
She never used the word "rape," okay?

22:45.440 --> 22:47.567
_ It was not clear
that it was a sexual assault.

22:47.650 --> 22:49.481
But isn't it your job to fill in the gaps?

22:49.570 --> 22:52.403
No, my job is to ask questions, and I did.

22:52.950 --> 22:57.865
What was clear was that
she was uncomfortable talking to me.

22:57.950 --> 23:00.111
Did you think of referring her
to a female counselor?

23:00.870 --> 23:02.747
I didn't have a chance to before she left.

23:02.830 --> 23:04.832
So, even if she didn't say
the word "rape,"

23:05.420 --> 23:08.719
knowing what you know now,
do you believe Hannah was raped?

23:10.340 --> 23:16.176
I didn't necessarily think so
at the time, but...

23:18.180 --> 23:19.420
yes, I believe that she was.

23:19.890 --> 23:23.109
-[Dennis] By a student at Liberty?
-[Kevin] Yes.

23:23.190 --> 23:25.932
-[Dennis] And the name of that student?
-Objection! Speculation.

23:26.020 --> 23:28.147
Your Honor, the witness already testiﬁed

23:28.240 --> 23:32.153
that Hannah never named
this alleged attacker.

23:32.240 --> 23:34.231
Your Honor,
Mr. Porter believes Hannah was raped,

23:34.490 --> 23:36.617
which means he now believes
that Hannah came to his office

23:36.700 --> 23:37.610
with a serious problem.

23:37.700 --> 23:39.076
The school's response to that

23:39.160 --> 23:41.822
_ _ _ and their failure to
dlSClpllne the offender is relevant.

23:43.210 --> 23:46.088
-Overruled.
-We'|l object again, Your Honor.

23:46.170 --> 23:49.082
It's a violation of FERPA
for this student to be named.

23:49.170 --> 23:51.252
[Dennis] The witness
didn't come by this information

23:51.340 --> 23:53.752
-in a confidential setting.
-[judge] I'll allow the question.

23:53.840 --> 23:55.796
-[Sonya] Your Honor--
-[judge] I'll allow it.

23:57.310 --> 24:01.553
[Dennis] Mr. Porter, do you know the name
of the student that raped Hannah Baker?

24:10.240 --> 24:13.653
I have since come to learn
that his name is Bryce Walker.

24:17.280 --> 24:18.656
[gavel banging]

24:30.010 --> 24:32.467
Hey. I've been looking for you.

24:33.430 --> 24:35.170
[Chle] Sorry I didn't call you back
this weekend.

24:35.260 --> 24:38.502
I had to babysit my sister,
and my mom was working, and...

24:40.600 --> 24:44.513
Chle, look, I know we talked
a little bit on Friday

24:44.600 --> 24:46.397
about how Hannah made all that stuff up.

24:47.060 --> 24:49.267
"Every girl at this school
wants to be raped"?

24:52.610 --> 24:54.066
Bryce, what does that even mean?

24:54.700 --> 24:55.769
[sighs] It was just...

24:56.070 --> 24:57.617
It was me talking shit.

24:57.910 --> 25:00.788
I was a little drunk
and that kid pissed me off.

25:02.330 --> 25:04.867
And people come at you
when they're jealous. You know that.

25:05.790 --> 25:06.745
What about Hannah?

25:09.630 --> 25:10.449
Okay.

25:11.960 --> 25:12.870
Um...

25:14.340 --> 25:16.752
the truth is Hannah and I hooked up.

25:16.840 --> 25:21.379
And it didn't mean anything to me,
but she got, like, obsessed.

25:22.390 --> 25:24.847
And she said all that stuff
to get back at me.

25:26.100 --> 25:27.806
Why didn't you tell me any of this before?

25:27.900 --> 25:30.061
I'm sorry. I know, I should have. I...

25:31.360 --> 25:33.180
I didn't wanna talk shit
about a dead girl.

25:33.570 --> 25:34.685
[Chle sighs]

25:38.620 --> 25:41.692
You know, I-- I feel terrible
about what happened to her.

25:44.160 --> 25:45.036
And, um...

25:48.540 --> 25:52.249
Um, you know, I was embarrassed...

25:54.800 --> 25:56.711
that you might have to hear all that shit.

26:02.430 --> 26:03.886
That you might believe it.

26:05.270 --> 26:06.089
[chuckles]

26:11.980 --> 26:12.969
Okay.

26:15.110 --> 26:16.065
You're, um...

26:21.990 --> 26:23.696
You're just-- You're really special to me.

26:25.250 --> 26:28.287
And my folks, uh,
they missed you on Sunday.

26:29.870 --> 26:32.873
Yeah, Ijust...
I had to babysit my sister, so...

26:33.090 --> 26:34.955
It's cool. They just wanted to see
if you wanted to come

26:35.050 --> 26:37.086
to the Amalfi Coast with us this summer.

26:37.840 --> 26:38.670
Wait.

26:39.800 --> 26:42.007
-Oh, my God, are you serious?
-Yeah, it'll be fun.

26:42.890 --> 26:44.801
I mean, there's a certain amount
of dressing up

26:44.890 --> 26:47.347
and having-cocktails-with-adults bullshit
that we gotta do,

26:47.430 --> 26:48.727
but the rest is just...

26:49.560 --> 26:52.893
sun and food, beauty.

26:53.730 --> 26:54.765
That's amazing.

26:55.030 --> 26:55.928
Yeah. [sniffles]

26:56.860 --> 26:59.738
I've never even left the country before.
I don't even have a passport.

26:59.820 --> 27:01.151
We'll take care of all that stuff.

27:01.820 --> 27:02.980
So, what do you say?

27:03.370 --> 27:06.749
Can the cheer team summer camp
spare you for a few weeks?

27:10.790 --> 27:13.167
Ah, dude, what are we gonna do--

27:16.170 --> 27:17.797
Shit, are we, like, interrupting?

27:17.880 --> 27:18.915
No, no, it's cool.

27:19.010 --> 27:22.582
We were just making plans for Chle
to come to Italy this summer. Right, babe?

27:22.680 --> 27:23.840
Yeah, maybe.

27:23.930 --> 27:25.557
I-- I have to ask my mom first.

27:26.600 --> 27:28.170
-I'|| catch up with you later.
-Okay.

27:30.020 --> 27:32.591
Seriously?
Who says "maybe" to a free vacation?

27:32.690 --> 27:34.555
Jesus. Chew your fucking food.

27:34.650 --> 27:36.515
[unzipping bag]

27:43.200 --> 27:44.815
Does no one ever see the red light?

27:47.740 --> 27:48.946
-Oh, hey, man.
-Hey.

27:55.250 --> 27:56.239
So, um...

27:58.210 --> 27:59.620
are you and your parents all good?

28:00.630 --> 28:03.178
Mack said you guys
had, like, a family emergency.

28:04.050 --> 28:05.381
I had to pick her up from the Crestmont.

28:05.470 --> 28:08.633
Yeah, no.
Uh, everything's totally fine now, yeah.

28:09.060 --> 28:10.596
Mack's a good liar. You?

28:11.520 --> 28:12.339
Not so much.

28:13.560 --> 28:14.436
What the hell, man?

28:15.560 --> 28:17.437
-Who bails on someone like that?
-No, I know.

28:19.110 --> 28:20.099
It's just, um...

28:22.110 --> 28:24.908
we're friends, and, uh...

28:26.410 --> 28:31.438
dating your sister just kind of felt like
I was crossing a line.

28:32.290 --> 28:34.451
But I don't-- I won't ever--

28:34.710 --> 28:37.918
I never want to disrespect you
or Mackenzie.

28:38.420 --> 28:39.330
And I'm just...

28:42.630 --> 28:43.756
I am sorry I ghosted.

28:43.930 --> 28:46.797
Don't tell me, tell her.

28:48.390 --> 28:50.517
I'm glad we cleared this whole thing up.

28:50.850 --> 28:52.841
Thought you might have become
an actual asshole.

28:54.100 --> 28:58.309
Speaking of assholes,
what's next for our friend Marcus, huh?

28:58.400 --> 29:00.812
-Oh, man, we're done with Marcus.
-What? Why?

29:00.900 --> 29:02.777
He got suspended.
I don't think we can top that.

29:03.240 --> 29:05.310
What? Holy shit, that's amazing!

29:05.410 --> 29:07.401
People are finally
starting to pay attention.

29:07.490 --> 29:10.232
They're starting to see
these fucking hypocrites for who they are.

29:10.330 --> 29:12.616
We got Marcus.
We're about to destroy Ryan...

29:52.700 --> 29:53.940
[Amber] So, that's it?

29:54.700 --> 29:57.828
That was it all along?
You just wanted his money?

29:58.790 --> 29:59.870
[bills rustle]

29:59.960 --> 30:02.167
I'm getting out of here, Mom.
You should, too.

30:03.340 --> 30:04.159
Honey...

30:04.840 --> 30:08.924
you can run as far as you want,
you will never get away from who you are.

30:09.300 --> 30:10.176
That's fine.

30:11.640 --> 30:13.801
Just as long as I can get away
from who I was.

30:17.640 --> 30:18.720
[Amber] He'll kill me.

30:20.560 --> 30:21.606
When he finds out.

30:31.160 --> 30:32.320
Not if he can't find you.

30:39.370 --> 30:42.282
Okay, so, three stops in town
for supplies:

30:42.380 --> 30:44.746
gas station, Walplex,
Ralphie's Pet Store.

30:44.920 --> 30:45.750
Pet store?

30:46.130 --> 30:47.085
Dude, trust me.

30:47.420 --> 30:49.581
We're going to wait for dark,
take the service road,

30:49.680 --> 30:51.750
then we're gonna rush the stuff in,
and boom.

30:52.800 --> 30:54.006
-Nice.
-Shit. Chill.

31:00.140 --> 31:01.050
[Tyler] Hey, Clay.

31:02.810 --> 31:03.686
Hey.

31:07.070 --> 31:08.025
You in the right place?

31:09.570 --> 31:10.446
Apparently.

31:10.740 --> 31:12.116
Why? I mean, what are you here for?

31:13.530 --> 31:16.158
Truancy, grudges,

31:16.240 --> 31:18.538
the hypocrisy
of high school administrators.

31:19.290 --> 31:21.747
Dude, we've never officially met,

31:21.830 --> 31:23.912
but you helped me fix my bike once
freshman year.

31:24.590 --> 31:25.454
Cyrus.

31:26.170 --> 31:27.626
-Clay.
-Dude, I know.

31:28.340 --> 31:31.503
That Bryce Walker thing?
That was fucking hard-core, man.

31:31.760 --> 31:34.092
I mean, you have balls.

31:34.760 --> 31:37.467
I mean, we heard you literally
getting the shit kicked out of you.

31:37.560 --> 31:38.629
You're coughing up blood.

31:38.730 --> 31:41.972
And you still keep fucking talking to him?
I mean, damn.

31:42.810 --> 31:44.892
Uh... thanks?

31:45.190 --> 31:46.896
No. Thank you.

31:48.860 --> 31:51.237
So, what do you guys actually do in here?

31:51.320 --> 31:54.448
We plot the complete
and violent overthrow of civilization.

31:57.740 --> 31:58.570
Supen

31:59.910 --> 32:00.786
Count me in.

32:03.330 --> 32:05.958
[Sonya] Isn't it true
that Hannah failed to use words

32:06.040 --> 32:08.042
or phrases that indicated to you,

32:08.130 --> 32:11.372
with certainty,
that a sexual assault had taken place?

32:12.880 --> 32:14.677
-Yes.
-[Sonya] And is it not true

32:14.760 --> 32:17.718
that_she refused to name
this alleged attacker?

32:18.100 --> 32:18.919
Yes.

32:19.020 --> 32:22.638
And isn't it true, Mr. Porter,
that you listened, inquired,

32:22.730 --> 32:26.723
and offered her suggestions to address
the concerns she did share?

32:27.270 --> 32:28.146
Yes.

32:28.860 --> 32:32.023
Then according
to the Liberty High handbook,

32:32.780 --> 32:35.317
Hannah didn't give you
the information needed

32:35.780 --> 32:38.157
to go about the mandatory protocols,
correct?

32:38.990 --> 32:39.820
Correct.

32:42.120 --> 32:44.702
Therefore, you did everything
that was required of you,

32:44.790 --> 32:47.452
and the truth is there was nothing more
you could have done.

32:48.840 --> 32:49.829
Would you agree?

32:54.220 --> 32:55.209
[Kevin sighs]

32:59.890 --> 33:00.709
No.

33:01.850 --> 33:04.592
-[Sonya] Let me rephrase that question--
-I said, no.

33:08.690 --> 33:09.725
I could have done more.

33:13.570 --> 33:16.653
-[Sonya] Nothing further, Your Honor.
-She didn't just leave.

33:17.910 --> 33:18.945
I let her go.

33:19.030 --> 33:20.941
Nothing further, Mr. Porter. Thank you.

33:21.580 --> 33:22.990
[Dennis] I'd like a redirect.

33:26.790 --> 33:28.246
-[phone ringing]
-Hey, Hannah, wait.

33:28.330 --> 33:29.877
Hannah, I said stop! Please.

33:30.670 --> 33:31.739
[Kevin slams receiver]

33:33.340 --> 33:35.217
Look, I can't let you walk out that door.

33:35.590 --> 33:37.467
Why? What else is there to say?

33:37.760 --> 33:39.887
Listen, what happened to you
was not your fault.

33:39.970 --> 33:41.676
You don't know what happened to me.

33:41.760 --> 33:45.218
Hannah, if my daughter were older,
I would tell her the same thing.

33:46.140 --> 33:48.768
That men, they can control themselves.

33:48.860 --> 33:49.895
Everybody can.

33:50.190 --> 33:53.273
Everybody acts like consent
is this complicated thing, but it's not.

33:53.940 --> 33:56.773
All right? Everybody knows
whether they have it or not,

33:56.860 --> 33:58.600
and it was that boy's job to know.

34:00.620 --> 34:01.518
Mr. Porter...

34:02.080 --> 34:03.365
Listen. Listen to me.

34:04.580 --> 34:05.569
It wasn't your fault.

34:07.210 --> 34:08.529
We need to get you some help.

34:11.130 --> 34:14.372
What if it's too late?
What if I'm too messed up to fix it?

34:14.460 --> 34:16.166
No. It's never too late.

34:16.590 --> 34:17.579
It's never too late.

34:18.340 --> 34:20.080
Just, please, sit down.

34:24.970 --> 34:25.800
[door closes]

34:29.400 --> 34:30.469
[Hannah sighs]

34:32.820 --> 34:35.311
You have so much life to live.

34:35.780 --> 34:36.895
You have so much.

34:37.820 --> 34:40.869
And you're gonna get--
You're gonna get through this.

34:41.950 --> 34:42.939
I'm gonna help you.

34:43.990 --> 34:46.322
There are many people out there
that wanna help you.

34:46.830 --> 34:47.649
Hannah".

34:49.290 --> 34:50.450
it's gonna be okay.

34:54.880 --> 34:55.949
But it is too late.

34:57.670 --> 34:58.546
I'm dead.

35:06.430 --> 35:07.260
[sighs]

35:10.140 --> 35:11.095
Yeah.

35:11.980 --> 35:15.564
But some girl, somewhere, right now...

35:17.190 --> 35:21.103
she's going through, you know,
what you're feeling,

35:21.200 --> 35:22.690
and I don't want her to die.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.115
You hear me?

35:34.670 --> 35:36.991
[Kevin crying]

35:45.350 --> 35:50.014
I was just trying to do the...
the right thing.

35:51.810 --> 35:54.517
I was following protocol. [sniffles]

35:55.900 --> 35:57.777
The protocol probably needs to change.

35:58.230 --> 35:59.481
But more importantly...

36:02.990 --> 36:04.651
Kevin Porter needs to change.

36:10.330 --> 36:13.618
[sighs, voice breaks] Mrs. Baker,
I didn't mean to let your daughter down.

36:23.430 --> 36:24.636
I'm sorry.

36:31.730 --> 36:33.721
[chatter]

36:36.270 --> 36:37.510
[door opens]

36:49.450 --> 36:50.690
You did the right thing.

36:52.660 --> 36:54.366
I doubt that the school will agree.

36:54.830 --> 36:58.743
But are you right with you?
Are you at peace in your own heart?

37:01.460 --> 37:04.429
Good Lord, babe,
I don't think that I ever will be.

37:06.970 --> 37:08.631
You're a good man, Kevin Porter.

37:13.730 --> 37:15.550
What do you think
they're gonna do to me?

37:16.940 --> 37:18.305
Nothing they haven't done already.

37:18.980 --> 37:21.562
Nothing that's gonna hurt you
more than what you feel right now.

37:23.240 --> 37:25.140
Come on, let's go home.

37:26.160 --> 37:26.979
Yeah.

37:30.580 --> 37:32.787
[chatter]

37:49.850 --> 37:51.806
[Clay grunting]

37:53.470 --> 37:54.721
[Clay groaning]

38:04.570 --> 38:06.561
[panting, groaning]

38:10.240 --> 38:11.400
[door slams]

38:13.080 --> 38:15.537
[door opens, slams]

38:15.960 --> 38:18.281
[gasping, groans]

38:20.580 --> 38:21.990
[gasping continues]

38:55.410 --> 38:56.240
[Zach knocks]

38:58.080 --> 38:59.570
-[Zach] Hey.
-Hey.

39:00.620 --> 39:01.496
Are you...

39:02.840 --> 39:04.910
Um, I mean, what are you listening to?

39:05.960 --> 39:07.916
A podcast for English.

39:09.340 --> 39:11.331
-Cool.
-But. ..

39:11.760 --> 39:14.217
um, yeah, I've-- I've heard the tapes.

39:20.140 --> 39:22.358
You know about Mr. Porter, right?

39:22.980 --> 39:25.312
-About what happened in court today?
-Yeah.

39:31.240 --> 39:32.059
Are you okay?

39:33.950 --> 39:34.769
I'm fine.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.075
I believe Bryce.

39:42.790 --> 39:44.872
I know he's... he's got a good heart.

39:47.840 --> 39:49.717
Are you sure that you're okay?

39:50.930 --> 39:52.386
With him and everything?

39:53.840 --> 39:54.670
Yeah.

39:56.220 --> 39:57.426
Yeah, no, we're good.

39:58.890 --> 40:00.300
You can tell Bryce I believe him.

40:02.980 --> 40:03.799
Cool.

40:14.950 --> 40:17.111
-[pop music playing]
-[both vocalizing]

40:20.370 --> 40:22.668
-Oh, my God.
-Where you going?

40:23.210 --> 40:24.780
Dude, your friends are really cool.

40:25.380 --> 40:27.587
I love that they know nothing about me.

40:28.050 --> 40:28.869
Right?

40:30.130 --> 40:31.210
So, is Garrett coming?

40:32.300 --> 40:34.040
Uh, no, he had a thing.

40:34.760 --> 40:35.579
Um...

40:37.010 --> 40:38.250
So, what do you think of Damon?

40:39.350 --> 40:41.227
He's been checking you out all afternoon.

40:41.680 --> 40:43.090
And the boy can move.

40:43.190 --> 40:44.646
He's the best hurdler at Washington.

40:44.900 --> 40:47.107
Washington? That's, like, our rival.

40:47.520 --> 40:49.476
Yeah. And he's cute, right?

40:52.740 --> 40:54.150
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

40:56.320 --> 40:57.821
I don't know. I mean...

40:59.700 --> 41:01.656
I don't think I know how to flirt anymore.

41:03.080 --> 41:04.707
There's only one way to find out.

41:06.080 --> 41:06.910
You feel me?

41:07.250 --> 41:08.410
[laughs]

41:08.630 --> 41:10.086
[Damon] I gotta admit something.

41:12.260 --> 41:13.329
Every time you've smiled,

41:14.300 --> 41:16.382
I forgot where I was
'cause I get so caught up in it.

41:16.680 --> 41:18.796
[both laugh]

41:18.890 --> 41:20.005
Wow, that's...

41:22.980 --> 41:25.631
the nicest thing anyone's said to me
in a really long time.

41:26.100 --> 41:26.930
Yeah?

41:34.200 --> 41:37.658
[others] Ooh!

41:38.370 --> 41:39.189
[car horn honks]

41:39.830 --> 41:43.152
[honking continues]

41:43.250 --> 41:45.992
[stammering]
Shit. I'm sorry, I have to go.

41:48.710 --> 41:49.995
I'll see you later, Nina.

41:51.170 --> 41:53.331
Can I get your number, or...?

42:00.640 --> 42:03.632
-The hell you doing with that boy?
-Dad, relax, please.

42:03.720 --> 42:04.800
How can I?

42:04.890 --> 42:06.437
Help me understand, Jessica.

42:06.520 --> 42:10.638
Help me to understand how,
after everything,

42:10.810 --> 42:12.311
you put yourself out there like that?

42:12.570 --> 42:13.889
I don't know, Dad.

42:20.410 --> 42:21.980
I'm just worried about you.

42:22.620 --> 42:25.111
About these new friends of yours,
this Nina girl.

42:26.660 --> 42:28.287
Are they the best influence for you?

42:28.460 --> 42:30.451
What? Why? Because they're black?

42:31.750 --> 42:33.081
Is that a serious question?

42:34.920 --> 42:36.217
Have you looked at me lately?

42:42.600 --> 42:44.340
[both laughing]

42:48.440 --> 42:49.304
Really?

42:51.520 --> 42:52.726
Oh, my God.

42:53.770 --> 42:55.226
I don't know, Dad.

42:57.030 --> 42:57.985
[exhales]

42:58.700 --> 43:01.066
It was like it wasn't me up there.

43:01.410 --> 43:03.116
I thought I was ready, but...

43:05.660 --> 43:06.820
clearly I'm not.

43:09.370 --> 43:12.498
Ijust... I don't wanna make
a big deal out of it.

43:13.130 --> 43:16.338
I'm just trying
to figure everything out, okay?

43:19.260 --> 43:22.388
Okay. Okay.

43:24.640 --> 43:26.847
-[engine starts]
-And can we please not tell Mom?

43:27.430 --> 43:29.512
[laughing] Oh...

43:29.850 --> 43:32.262
-You better believe.
-[both laugh]

43:38.320 --> 43:39.981
[Cyrus] Dude, what happened to you?

43:45.660 --> 43:48.402
[chatter]

43:50.910 --> 43:51.911
Don't worry about it.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.662
Fuck, man. You have a way
of getting the shit kicked out of you.

43:55.880 --> 43:56.915
Thank you for noticing.

43:57.500 --> 43:58.660
It's about power, man.

44:02.090 --> 44:03.250
What do you mean?

44:04.180 --> 44:06.216
The people who have it
and the people who don't.

44:06.930 --> 44:07.760
You feel that, right?

44:10.020 --> 44:13.433
Me and Tyler, we don't have the power.
We get shit on, pushed around.

44:13.520 --> 44:14.805
Now you're one of us, too.

44:16.070 --> 44:17.389
-You think?
-You are.

44:17.690 --> 44:18.566
Dude.

44:19.110 --> 44:21.897
But we're gonna take some of that power
back tonight, me and Tyler.

44:21.990 --> 44:23.196
What are you talking about?

44:23.410 --> 44:24.365
Don't tell him.

44:24.950 --> 44:26.861
-Tell me what?
-We can't trust him.

44:26.950 --> 44:29.157
-We hate the same people.
-That doesn't mean anything.

44:29.240 --> 44:30.241
It does, though.

44:31.250 --> 44:33.787
He's got plenty of reasons
to fuck shit up, just like us.

44:34.330 --> 44:37.333
-It's not like we couldn't use the help.
-What are you talking about?

44:39.880 --> 44:42.041
[sighs] That does look like it hurts, man.

44:43.760 --> 44:44.579
Yeah.

44:46.430 --> 44:47.419
You wanna hit back?

44:50.560 --> 44:51.720
[door bell jingles]

44:53.810 --> 44:55.141
[Alex] Hi, Mrs. Baker.

44:57.480 --> 44:58.469
Alex, hi.

44:58.570 --> 45:03.849
I was, um-- I was just wondering,
is the job still open?

45:05.110 --> 45:06.862
Yes. Of course.

45:07.280 --> 45:10.943
Okay, well, um, I can start right now.

45:11.160 --> 45:14.789
I've just, um-- I've just had to do
some things lately, physically,

45:15.040 --> 45:19.158
that made me realize that I can--
I can just do more than I thought.

45:20.210 --> 45:25.250
Well, you're hired.
So, should I call your parents, or...?

45:25.430 --> 45:28.172
No, they'll be fine.
They wanna see me moving forward.

45:28.390 --> 45:29.209
I see.

45:29.810 --> 45:32.597
Well, it's--
It's important to move forward.

45:32.680 --> 45:34.636
That's what people tell me. [chuckles]

45:34.980 --> 45:37.687
I think I've been spending
too much time looking back.

45:37.770 --> 45:41.319
Well, sometimes you have to go back
in order to move on.

45:41.400 --> 45:42.219
I...

45:46.780 --> 45:47.599
Oh, my God.

45:49.830 --> 45:50.899
Excuse me just a minute.

46:04.880 --> 46:08.293
-Oh, man. Yo, that penalty was bullshit.
-That was a clean hit.

46:08.390 --> 46:10.756
-You know that was a clean hit.
-That was so bullshit.

46:16.890 --> 46:17.845
What the fuck?

46:19.730 --> 46:20.606
Hey.

46:21.980 --> 46:22.935
God damn it.

46:24.860 --> 46:26.441
-Goddamn motherfucker.
-Hey, hey...

46:26.530 --> 46:28.407
-Motherfucker!
-Calm down, Tony.

46:28.610 --> 46:30.737
-Calm down, Tony.
-Don't tell me to calm down.

46:30.820 --> 46:32.617
-This is my car!
-This is what we're working on.

46:32.700 --> 46:34.281
-Anger management--
-Fuck that shit.

46:34.370 --> 46:36.361
No, okay, okay, we'll call the police.

46:36.460 --> 46:38.576
-They might still be in the neighborhood.
-No, no cops.

46:38.670 --> 46:39.659
Come on, I'm calling--

46:39.750 --> 46:42.492
What the fuck did I just say, huh?
What did I just say?

46:42.880 --> 46:44.541
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Get off me.

46:44.630 --> 46:46.370
-Stop doing this right now.
-Get off of me!

46:46.470 --> 46:48.290
You stop this right now. What the--?

46:52.300 --> 46:53.380
Shit!

46:53.810 --> 46:56.517
-Tony, Tony, I'm sorry, look--
-Get off of me.

46:57.640 --> 46:59.722
Tony. Tony, stop.

46:59.900 --> 47:02.141
-Just go, just go.
-No, I'm not going anywhere.

47:02.360 --> 47:03.566
Get the fuck out of here!

47:03.820 --> 47:05.890
Look at me, look at me.
Look at me, look at me.

47:05.980 --> 47:08.392
It's just a car, it's just a car.
It'll mend.

47:08.990 --> 47:12.278
It'll mend, right?
I know it's your car, but it's just a car.

47:14.370 --> 47:17.362
-What are you scared of?
-I can't tell you, man...

47:17.450 --> 47:20.704
-Shh. Stop, stop. Stop. Stop.
-[Tony crying]

47:22.290 --> 47:23.166
I'm here.

47:36.930 --> 47:39.558
There are some things that I've done
that ifI tell you...

47:41.850 --> 47:43.056
You can tell me anything.

47:43.730 --> 47:44.560
I can't.

47:47.150 --> 47:48.060
I can't.

47:51.360 --> 47:54.318
-[Tony crying]
-It's okay, it's okay.

47:55.330 --> 47:56.285
It's okay.

48:11.840 --> 48:14.593
when they feel they have no avenue
for understanding...

they act out.

-[laughs] Dude!

48:20.520 --> 48:22.226
-Fuck, yes!
-Yeah.

-You're good at this.
-Yeah.

48:25.980 --> 48:27.891
[stammering] My, um, ex-girlfriend,

48:27.980 --> 48:29.936
we did this, like, whole mural

48:30.030 --> 48:32.316
on one of those abandoned buildings
by the docks.

48:32.400 --> 48:33.697
-Badass.
-Yeah.

48:33.780 --> 48:36.112
-Sorry about the "ex" part.
-[exhales]

48:39.910 --> 48:40.945
Is he outlining?

48:42.330 --> 48:44.491
-Tyler's kind of OCD.
-Oh.

48:44.580 --> 48:47.583
I misspelled "hypocrite"
on Marcus's window, and he freaked out.

48:47.670 --> 48:49.160
Wait, that paint bomb?

48:49.340 --> 48:50.159
-What?
-Guilty.

48:50.260 --> 48:51.329

[chattering, laughing]

49:22.540 --> 49:23.495
Holy shit.

49:25.040 --> 49:26.029
That was close.

49:26.920 --> 49:28.239
Are they partying back there?

49:28.840 --> 49:29.659
I-- I gotta go.

49:30.130 --> 49:31.836
Wait, what about the big finale?

49:32.590 --> 49:33.716
Uh, I gotta, um...

49:34.220 --> 49:36.586
I just figured something out.
I'm sorry, but I gotta go.

49:42.520 --> 49:43.885
[spray can rattling]

49:57.990 --> 49:58.809
[Justin] Fuck!

50:00.740 --> 50:03.903
[Kevin] Hannah and I,
we failed each other.

50:06.420 --> 50:11.665
If we had only tried harder, each of us,
to reach out, to understand,

50:13.090 --> 50:17.379
to trust each other,
to let ourselves help and be helped,

50:18.640 --> 50:20.540
it would have made all the difference.

50:21.810 --> 50:22.799
[cell phone chimes]

50:52.420 --> 50:54.832
[Kevin] I can't go back
and fix my mistake.

I can't change the past.

I know I shouldn't be here,
and I know why you've come.

What can I do?

-Mom?

We have to ask for help.
