I'm sorry.

01:10:24.764 --> 01:10:26.874
I really messed up
at the assembly, I know.

01:10:26.876 --> 01:10:30.060
Kim, you were
a garbage friend

01:10:30.062 --> 01:10:32.876
way before the fight
at the assembly.

01:10:32.878 --> 01:10:34.150
Uh...

01:10:34.152 --> 01:10:40.187
It was great when I was your pet
project who blew up your ego.

"I can't believe I'm doing a

01:10:46.862 --> 01:10:50.315
But the moment that I started
to surpass you,

01:10:50.317 --> 01:10:55.815
you fell apart.

01:10:55.817 --> 01:10:58.130
You're right.

be your friend who inspires you.
