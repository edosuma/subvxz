WEBVTT

00:02.260 --> 00:03.613
The Lord is my shepherd

00:03.733 --> 00:06.283
therefore can I lack nothing.

00:07.601 --> 00:09.727
He shall feed me in a
green pasture

00:09.847 --> 00:12.637
and lead me forth beside
the waters of comfort.

00:13.548 --> 00:15.551
He shall convert my soul

00:15.671 --> 00:18.783
and bring me forth in
the paths of righteousness.

00:18.903 --> 00:21.816
For His name's sake,
Amen.

00:22.283 --> 00:23.951
Amen.

00:23.985 --> 00:26.753
For as much as it hath pleased
almighty God

00:26.788 --> 00:27.988
in his great mercy

00:28.022 --> 00:30.524
to take unto himself the...

00:33.328 --> 00:35.195
<i>We therefore commit</i>
<i>her body to the ground,</i>

00:35.230 --> 00:38.899
earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
<i>dust to dust,</i>

00:38.933 --> 00:43.070
<i>in sure and certain hope</i>
<i>of the resurrection...</i>

00:50.696 --> 00:51.662
Madame Pride.

00:51.697 --> 00:54.699
We are sorry for your loss.

00:54.733 --> 00:56.300
Thank you all for coming.

00:56.335 --> 00:57.602
She wanted me to tell you

00:57.636 --> 00:58.603
she did good.

00:58.637 --> 00:59.604
Tommy, not now...

00:59.638 --> 01:00.671
No. No, if he has
something to say,

01:00.706 --> 01:02.783
I'd like to hear it.

01:04.343 --> 01:05.610
She was a decorated detective.

01:05.644 --> 01:08.312
In most any family,
she'd be a hero.

01:08.347 --> 01:11.182
But she died

01:11.216 --> 01:15.560
wanting her parents to be told
she did good...

01:16.522 --> 01:19.123
Because in hers,
it wasn't enough.

01:24.880 --> 01:28.299
Tommy was with her at the end.

01:28.333 --> 01:29.267
That must have been

01:29.301 --> 01:32.170
a very difficult message
to deliver.

01:32.204 --> 01:35.073
Thank him for me.

01:35.107 --> 01:36.307
Please excuse me.

01:36.341 --> 01:38.176
Yeah.

He's a widower.

02:28.927 --> 02:31.462
His daughter's
the model in the red.

02:37.202 --> 02:38.369
Aw...

02:38.404 --> 02:40.138
Sweet.

02:40.172 --> 02:41.372
Like a rotten banana.

02:41.407 --> 02:42.640
You're such a cynic.

02:42.674 --> 02:44.308
A realist.

02:44.343 --> 02:45.710
History of violence?

02:45.744 --> 02:46.878
Not that I know of.

02:46.912 --> 02:47.912
Did you check?

02:47.946 --> 02:49.280
Publicly,
he's a pillar of society.

02:49.314 --> 02:51.516
Aye, but behind closed doors,
he might put me in a pit

02:51.550 --> 02:53.618
and send lotion down
in a basket.

02:55.187 --> 02:56.187
You're not the one

02:56.221 --> 02:57.388
who has to be alone
with these creeps.

02:57.423 --> 02:59.724
What can I tell you, Nicole?

02:59.758 --> 03:01.192
There will be risk.

03:01.226 --> 03:03.327
Do we have to do this
every bloody time?

03:03.362 --> 03:06.164
Every bloody time.

03:06.963 --> 03:08.337
Where's the painting?

03:08.457 --> 03:09.600
In the living room.

03:10.485 --> 03:11.518
Any more questions?

03:11.553 --> 03:12.586
Yeah.

03:12.620 --> 03:14.354
When do I get paid?

03:29.421 --> 03:31.723
Contact.

03:31.757 --> 03:33.725
Think she'll get in?

03:33.759 --> 03:35.860
She always does.

03:35.894 --> 03:37.662
Let's go and get ready.

03:49.308 --> 03:51.342
Okay, so now I'm impressed.

03:51.376 --> 03:52.944
You like?

03:52.978 --> 03:55.213
I love.

03:56.381 --> 03:57.515
Is this her?
Your wife?

03:57.549 --> 03:59.884
A year before she died.

03:59.918 --> 04:01.090
You loved her.

04:01.210 --> 04:02.812
I can hear it in your voice.

04:02.932 --> 04:04.006
I still do.

04:04.126 --> 04:06.238
Aw...

04:06.358 --> 04:09.903
After she died,
I moved into the city.

04:10.023 --> 04:13.079
Put myself back out there,
you know?

04:14.099 --> 04:15.850
There were too many memories
in that house.

04:15.970 --> 04:17.115
I didn't want to become
a sad, mad old man.

04:18.688 --> 04:19.821
You're not that old.

04:22.325 --> 04:23.858
I'll be right back.

04:36.572 --> 04:37.839
Van Gogh.

04:37.873 --> 04:41.576
I can see.

04:41.611 --> 04:43.144
I'm not the only one
around here

04:43.179 --> 04:44.679
with an eye for fine things.

04:49.952 --> 04:50.919
Nice.

04:51.339 --> 04:52.536
Ladies room?

04:52.656 --> 04:53.679
It's right there.

04:53.799 --> 04:54.768
Music?

04:54.888 --> 04:56.124
Music's nice.

05:27.323 --> 05:30.091
I like it, the music.

05:30.126 --> 05:31.326
Nice choice.

05:31.360 --> 05:33.061
Thank you.

05:33.095 --> 05:34.929
Oh, I think this one
must be yours.

05:34.964 --> 05:36.598
I know, I thought we'd swap.

05:36.632 --> 05:37.632
Why?

05:37.667 --> 05:39.334
Well, would you want
your daughter

05:39.368 --> 05:41.936
coming up to the flat
of a man she just met,

05:41.971 --> 05:43.638
drinking from a glass
he gave her?

05:52.081 --> 05:54.082
- You put something in my wine.
- What?

05:54.116 --> 05:55.617
- You did.
- Don't be ridiculous.

05:55.651 --> 05:56.951
There is definitely
something in this wine.

05:56.986 --> 05:59.287
It's probably just
the power of suggestion.

05:59.322 --> 06:01.156
I own the winery,
you little bitch!

06:01.190 --> 06:02.824
I know this wine
like the back of my hand.

06:02.858 --> 06:03.858
Now, what have you...

06:03.893 --> 06:04.793
Take a chill pill, granddad.

06:04.827 --> 06:06.194
Jesus...

06:06.229 --> 06:08.096
Old fashioned, I know,
but it burns like hell,

06:08.130 --> 06:09.731
and, believe me, you don't
want to add "blinded"

06:09.765 --> 06:11.833
to your list of worries
right now, okay?

06:11.867 --> 06:13.835
What? Wait...

06:13.869 --> 06:15.337
If I were you,

06:15.371 --> 06:16.805
I'd be more about
calling an ambulance.

06:16.839 --> 06:18.106
Bye.

To make this our permanent home,

08:16.603 --> 08:20.780
so if you choose to stay,

08:25.934 --> 08:27.781
So, that's it, then?

08:27.901 --> 08:30.317
Stick a few TVs on the wall
and a new desk,

08:30.351 --> 08:31.998
and we just forget about her?

08:32.118 --> 08:33.320
Forget?

08:33.604 --> 08:36.972
Tonight, a woman won't be
butchered in a park

08:37.008 --> 08:38.008
because Sienna stopped it...

08:38.042 --> 08:40.043
Because you all stopped it.

08:40.078 --> 08:42.078
This team, for me,

08:42.113 --> 08:44.981
will be the way
to remember her.

08:45.016 --> 08:48.285
So, are you in or not?

08:54.225 --> 08:55.993
I'm in.

08:57.095 --> 08:59.930
Yeah, all right.

08:59.964 --> 09:01.598
Me too.

09:05.970 --> 09:07.170
Absolutely.

09:08.740 --> 09:10.674
Tommy?

09:16.347 --> 09:18.281
All right, then.

09:25.723 --> 09:26.723
So what about you?

09:31.229 --> 09:33.030
Where's the coffee?

09:33.064 --> 09:35.265
Over there.

09:35.299 --> 09:37.667
That means you're staying?

09:40.672 --> 09:42.639
It means I want
a cup of coffee.

09:56.521 --> 09:58.555
Are those pills working?

09:59.757 --> 10:00.991
Not as fast as the morphine,

10:01.025 --> 10:02.059
or nearly as fun, but...

10:02.093 --> 10:04.394
They're okay.

10:06.030 --> 10:07.197
How are you feeling?

10:08.666 --> 10:11.201
I'm actually hoping
another case

10:11.235 --> 10:12.369
will get my mind off the pain.

10:12.403 --> 10:14.571
Don't push yourself.

10:14.605 --> 10:16.340
There's always another case
right around the corner.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.778
I... enjoyed

10:21.813 --> 10:24.047
learning from you.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.248
I hope I get to do more.

10:27.652 --> 10:30.787
You're an expert
in border offenses?

10:30.822 --> 10:32.122
Human trafficking?

10:32.978 --> 10:34.226
Mostly.

10:34.559 --> 10:36.026
Can we talk about that sometime?

10:36.060 --> 10:37.160
Why?

10:37.195 --> 10:40.007
We could learn from each other.

10:48.373 --> 10:51.375
Can you see if this man

10:51.409 --> 10:54.277
is in any of your
trafficking databases?

10:54.312 --> 10:56.546
Phillip Genovese.

10:56.581 --> 10:57.514
Just look him up?

10:57.548 --> 11:00.751
Just see
if he's on your radars.

11:07.759 --> 11:09.159
I never imagined a policeman

11:09.193 --> 11:12.329
having this many moving boxes.

11:12.363 --> 11:14.398
Most of them are files.

11:14.432 --> 11:15.532
Open cases,

11:15.566 --> 11:17.501
ongoing investigations.

11:17.535 --> 11:20.070
And you are the only
detective in all of Europe.

11:20.104 --> 11:21.238
They're not mine yet,

11:21.272 --> 11:25.434
but they all have
some cross-border implication.

11:26.110 --> 11:28.406
We need to create our own cases

11:28.526 --> 11:34.117
until locals get comfortable
calling us directly.

11:35.787 --> 11:37.354
You haven't asked me
about the Russian.

11:39.123 --> 11:41.892
If you have something
to tell me, you will.

11:44.128 --> 11:45.844
Rebecca?

11:46.798 --> 11:48.598
Well, she spends
most of her day

11:48.633 --> 11:49.833
in Etienne's room.

11:49.867 --> 11:52.402
I cannot bring myself
to go in there.

11:52.437 --> 11:54.604
We barely speak anymore.

11:54.639 --> 11:56.139
Hmm.

12:24.836 --> 12:28.805
Are you all right?

12:28.840 --> 12:32.743
Are you going to be that girl?

12:32.777 --> 12:34.177
"That girl?"

12:34.212 --> 12:38.916
The "I'm going to
mother everybody" girl.

12:38.950 --> 12:40.417
I just asked.

12:40.451 --> 12:42.152
Well, let's agree

12:42.186 --> 12:44.154
not to ask each other that,

12:44.188 --> 12:45.188
"Are you all right?"

12:46.791 --> 12:47.691
Okay? Ever.

12:47.725 --> 12:49.826
Let's make that deal.

12:54.198 --> 12:55.432
Are you drunk?

12:55.466 --> 12:56.500
I wish.

12:58.636 --> 13:00.704
Tradition in my family.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.205
One shot of whiskey
for the dead.

13:03.241 --> 13:04.408
Cheers, Sienna.

13:25.485 --> 13:26.662
Sebastian.

13:26.782 --> 13:27.957
Is your computer up
and running right now?

13:27.991 --> 13:29.058
Always.

13:29.092 --> 13:30.893
There was something
in the local news.

13:30.927 --> 13:32.194
Today's news?

13:32.229 --> 13:33.696
Yeah, today's news.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.664
A month ago,

13:35.699 --> 13:36.665
a millionaire died
of a mysterious virus

13:36.700 --> 13:37.666
in Dusseldorf.

13:37.701 --> 13:38.801
Poison was suspected,

13:38.835 --> 13:41.237
but the post mortem
was inconclusive.

13:42.239 --> 13:43.739
Now, take a look
at the headlines

13:43.774 --> 13:45.241
in the Amsterdam News.

13:47.611 --> 13:48.778
There it is.

13:50.213 --> 13:51.313
Is this the kind of thing

13:51.348 --> 13:53.249
the major is talking about?

13:53.283 --> 13:54.250
Same crime, two countries.

13:54.284 --> 13:56.619
Looks like.

14:01.457 --> 14:02.824
You know that guy died already?

14:02.859 --> 14:04.125
Who?

14:04.160 --> 14:05.760
Yesterday. Van Gogh.

14:05.880 --> 14:06.955
Already?

14:07.075 --> 14:09.944
Yeah, well, usually,
it takes a few days.

14:10.124 --> 14:11.467
Nicole must've really
upped the dose.

14:11.501 --> 14:13.402
The broad's
out of control, man.

14:13.436 --> 14:15.304
Yeah, but she's good.

14:15.338 --> 14:16.371
But this is going to
bring heat.

14:16.406 --> 14:18.474
It won't bring any heat

14:18.508 --> 14:20.242
as long as we keep
changing countries.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.895
Yeah, but it's all over
the news, that's not good.

14:22.015 --> 14:23.412
It doesn't matter.

14:23.446 --> 14:26.381
One more job,
and we're gone.

14:27.717 --> 14:29.485
So, yesterday in Amsterdam,

14:29.519 --> 14:33.288
a real estate developer died
of a mysterious illness.

14:33.323 --> 14:35.257
Doctors think it's a virus,

14:35.291 --> 14:37.125
but the victim's daughter,
a fashion model,

14:37.160 --> 14:39.061
insists there was foul play.

14:39.095 --> 14:41.296
Now, in the boxes
you asked us look at,

14:41.331 --> 14:44.566
I found a case
from last month in Germany,

14:44.601 --> 14:48.137
and same symptoms,
also a rich man,

14:48.171 --> 14:49.271
only, in Germany,

14:49.305 --> 14:51.740
the family found a vial
in the apartment

14:51.774 --> 14:53.742
that looks like
it could hold poison.

14:53.776 --> 14:55.144
The vial was tested,

14:55.178 --> 14:57.746
but the results
were inconclusive.

14:57.781 --> 14:59.314
And there was
a similar case in Venice

14:59.349 --> 15:01.216
five months ago.

15:01.251 --> 15:02.818
I went through
the Italian police reports.

15:02.852 --> 15:04.453
Same symptoms.

15:04.487 --> 15:06.321
How did you get
into Italian police reports?

15:06.356 --> 15:09.324
It wasn't hard to hack
into their computer systems.

15:09.359 --> 15:12.060
Remind me to tell them
to do a cyber security check.

15:12.095 --> 15:13.295
I'd still get in.

15:13.329 --> 15:15.063
How does the German family know

15:15.098 --> 15:16.432
that the vial wasn't something
already there?

15:16.466 --> 15:19.334
He'd had the same cleaning
woman for about 30 years,

15:19.369 --> 15:21.103
and paid her a fortune
so she wouldn't leave.

15:21.137 --> 15:22.604
Have you located her?

15:22.639 --> 15:24.773
That's another odd twist.

15:24.808 --> 15:26.241
She's in the hospital herself.

15:26.276 --> 15:27.676
In Neuss, near Dusseldorf.

15:27.710 --> 15:29.545
Can we at least check it out?

15:29.579 --> 15:31.413
It's definitely
cross-border.

15:31.447 --> 15:33.215
I'll have to clear
it with Dorn.

15:33.249 --> 15:35.517
In the meantime, Sebastian,

15:35.552 --> 15:37.085
I need you to go
to the latest scene,

15:37.120 --> 15:38.120
in Amsterdam.

15:38.154 --> 15:39.822
What do you want me to do?

15:39.856 --> 15:42.357
I need you and Eva in Germany.

15:42.392 --> 15:43.659
Carl,

15:43.693 --> 15:44.693
would you go with Sebastian

15:44.727 --> 15:46.094
and take a look at the scene?

15:46.129 --> 15:47.129
Sure.

15:47.264 --> 15:48.398
Eva?

15:48.432 --> 15:49.399
Yeah.

15:49.433 --> 15:51.201
Do you know where
Anne-Marie is?

15:51.235 --> 15:53.436
Um...

15:53.471 --> 15:55.305
Probably she's in the loo.

15:55.339 --> 15:57.040
I'll go and check it out.

16:07.951 --> 16:09.051
Hey.

16:09.085 --> 16:10.219
There you are.

16:10.253 --> 16:11.987
Um...

16:12.022 --> 16:13.422
We may have a new case.

16:13.456 --> 16:16.392
Good. Good...

16:19.963 --> 16:20.963
You okay?

16:20.997 --> 16:22.331
I'm fine. Fine.

16:42.885 --> 16:43.885
Michel...

16:43.920 --> 16:44.886
Let me come in.

16:44.921 --> 16:46.588
Maybe another time.

16:46.623 --> 16:48.090
You cannot close yourself off

16:48.124 --> 16:49.091
from the world.

16:49.125 --> 16:50.759
Don't tell me what I can't do.

16:50.793 --> 16:53.395
Louis does enough of that.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.897
I'll tell him you stopped by.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.532
I didn't come to see him,
and you know it.

16:58.568 --> 17:00.669
I know.

17:00.703 --> 17:03.772
I know, Michel.

17:03.806 --> 17:05.040
But I'm not ready.

17:05.074 --> 17:06.375
- For what?
- For comfort.

17:06.409 --> 17:08.643
Comfort? From me?

17:08.678 --> 17:10.479
Never.

17:10.512 --> 17:12.814
I do not have that ability.

17:14.183 --> 17:15.416
Then what do you want?

17:15.451 --> 17:18.119
I need you to tell me exactly
what happened that night.

17:21.057 --> 17:25.493
I'd just put Etienne to bed.

17:25.529 --> 17:27.496
Louis went out for more wine.

17:27.531 --> 17:31.667
It was a normal night.

17:31.701 --> 17:35.371
It was quiet.

17:35.405 --> 17:36.405
And then...

17:40.510 --> 17:44.180
His room is
just above the garage.

17:44.214 --> 17:46.048
I tried to go in, but...

17:46.082 --> 17:49.689
The room was gone.

17:52.189 --> 17:53.255
And then I saw him.

17:53.290 --> 17:56.258
<i>But not in the room.</i>

17:56.293 --> 18:00.262
<i>He was outside, on the grass.</i>

18:00.297 --> 18:03.332
What have you done?

18:07.470 --> 18:10.606
Is there...

18:10.640 --> 18:12.541
a possibility

18:12.576 --> 18:15.411
that Etienne was the target?

18:15.445 --> 18:16.345
Could they have been

18:16.379 --> 18:18.480
aiming for him?

18:18.515 --> 18:20.449
No.

18:20.484 --> 18:22.206
The bomb was in the car.

18:22.326 --> 18:24.353
Ah.

18:26.089 --> 18:27.389
Why do you ask?

18:27.424 --> 18:28.657
I'm just trying
to get a picture

18:28.692 --> 18:31.193
of the person that I am hunting.

18:31.228 --> 18:33.429
Why?

18:33.463 --> 18:34.719
He's turned this over to you?

18:34.839 --> 18:37.166
No, actually, I insisted

18:37.200 --> 18:39.301
that he let me do it.

18:39.336 --> 18:41.504
Why?
Does that make you angry?

18:41.538 --> 18:48.143
I'm not certain I can feel
anger anymore, Michel.

18:48.178 --> 18:50.546
I'm not certain
I can feel anything.

18:52.048 --> 18:53.148
He knows

18:53.183 --> 18:56.051
if he had taken
his car that night,

18:56.086 --> 18:57.386
Etienne would still be here.

18:57.420 --> 18:59.455
No, he doesn't know that.

18:59.489 --> 19:00.522
He may think that,

19:00.557 --> 19:02.791
but he does not know that.

19:06.763 --> 19:08.731
It's hard
to go through this alone.

19:10.433 --> 19:13.035
For him, too.

19:13.069 --> 19:16.505
He's trying to obliterate
his grief with his work.

19:16.540 --> 19:18.907
It's not his intent
to leave you alone.

19:19.743 --> 19:22.711
I don't mean physically.

19:22.746 --> 19:26.582
I'm used to him being gone.

19:26.616 --> 19:28.050
But he hasn't cried.

19:28.084 --> 19:33.422
Not once.

19:33.456 --> 19:35.457
And crying for two, it's...

19:35.492 --> 19:38.160
lonely.

19:40.664 --> 19:42.431
This way.

19:43.500 --> 19:46.135
His wife died
before he moved in,

19:46.169 --> 19:48.337
and his daughter
is not around much.

19:48.371 --> 19:49.405
She's a model.

19:49.439 --> 19:50.406
So we heard.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.775
When did you discover
that he was sick?

19:52.809 --> 19:56.449
First set of medics
said he was poisoned.

19:56.569 --> 19:57.995
"First set?"

19:58.115 --> 20:00.282
Yeah, they were from
a private company.

20:00.317 --> 20:02.518
Did
you report that?

20:02.552 --> 20:06.388
I'm used to rich people
having their own ambulances,

20:06.423 --> 20:08.324
private everything, you know.

20:08.358 --> 20:09.325
When the city guys got here,

20:09.359 --> 20:12.528
the private guys had
already disappeared.

20:12.562 --> 20:14.230
Disappeared?

20:14.264 --> 20:15.831
Yeah. They told me

20:15.866 --> 20:18.267
they were starting the call
for a city crew.

20:18.301 --> 20:19.535
That's why they wanted me

20:19.569 --> 20:21.070
to go back down and wait.

20:21.104 --> 20:24.273
We probably missed them
on our way up.

20:24.307 --> 20:25.374
Is anything missing?

20:25.408 --> 20:28.210
Not that I can see.

20:28.245 --> 20:29.678
Whoa, that's a van Gogh.

20:29.713 --> 20:30.679
What?

20:30.714 --> 20:33.649
Never mind.

20:33.683 --> 20:36.391
Do you know if that lipstick
belonged to his daughter?

20:36.511 --> 20:38.454
No.

20:38.488 --> 20:39.688
He had a lady over that night.

20:39.723 --> 20:41.524
This machine
will give us samples

20:41.558 --> 20:42.691
of all the fingerprints
in the flat,

20:42.726 --> 20:44.493
so we can isolate his
and anyone else's.

20:46.663 --> 20:48.297
That's odd.

20:48.331 --> 20:50.533
What's wrong?

20:50.567 --> 20:54.470
This doesn't use radio waves,
so it can't be interference.

20:59.843 --> 21:02.144
Okay, everybody take a big step
away from the glass.

21:02.179 --> 21:04.547
Step back now!

21:04.581 --> 21:06.448
What is it, Sebastian?

21:07.417 --> 21:09.451
There's only one thing
with the energy

21:09.486 --> 21:10.453
to cause this sort of dropout

21:10.487 --> 21:11.453
on the scangen.

21:11.488 --> 21:12.888
Radiation.

21:27.916 --> 21:31.107
<i>- Are you alright?</i>
- For now, yeah.

21:31.227 --> 21:32.261
<i>They took Sebastian's blood</i>
<i>just now,</i>

21:32.295 --> 21:33.695
<i>and now they're taking mine.</i>

21:33.730 --> 21:36.398
You'll find an unusually high
amount of opiates

21:36.433 --> 21:37.733
in my blood.

21:38.735 --> 21:39.802
I have a prescription.

21:39.836 --> 21:41.103
Oh.

21:41.137 --> 21:43.072
We're only checking
for radiation.

21:44.340 --> 21:45.774
Hazmat just identified it

21:45.809 --> 21:47.709
as Polonium 210.

21:47.744 --> 21:49.144
Scientists call it
"the Terminator".

21:49.179 --> 21:50.212
Oh, that's comforting.

21:50.246 --> 21:51.146
And did you ingest

21:51.181 --> 21:52.181
any of it?

21:52.215 --> 21:53.315
I don't think so.

21:53.350 --> 21:55.884
It's harmless if it stays
outside of the body,

21:55.919 --> 21:57.086
<i>but once inside,</i>

21:57.120 --> 21:58.721
<i>it usually takes days</i>

21:58.755 --> 22:00.422
<i>before there's</i>
<i>any signs of illness.</i>

22:00.457 --> 22:03.025
Our Amsterdam victim
died in a day.

22:03.059 --> 22:04.026
<i>Then he got a huge dose.</i>

22:04.060 --> 22:05.194
What are the symptoms?

22:05.228 --> 22:07.429
Multiple organ failure,

22:07.464 --> 22:10.232
lung collapse,
internal bleeding.

22:10.266 --> 22:12.556
It cooks your insides
like a microwave oven.

22:12.676 --> 22:14.735
You have a terrible
bedside manner, you know.

22:14.855 --> 22:16.939
Whatever bedside manner.
I'm not a doctor.

22:31.888 --> 22:32.955
Hi.

22:35.357 --> 22:37.760
I'm Eva Vittoria,
he is Tommy McConnell.

22:37.794 --> 22:38.861
We are from the ICC,

22:38.895 --> 22:41.096
and we believe your suspicions

22:41.131 --> 22:42.097
about your employer
being poisoned

22:42.132 --> 22:43.365
are correct.

22:46.302 --> 22:47.469
They said I was crazy.

22:47.504 --> 22:49.938
Do you mind if I sit?

22:49.973 --> 22:52.074
Please.

22:55.812 --> 22:57.312
Do you remember

22:57.347 --> 23:00.048
if anyone came
to visit your employer recently?

23:01.484 --> 23:02.451
No.

23:02.485 --> 23:03.686
No one?

23:03.720 --> 23:05.854
Do you know if anything
is missing from the house?

23:07.290 --> 23:10.259
Nothing was moved or changed,

23:10.293 --> 23:13.829
except for that vial.

23:13.863 --> 23:14.997
The vial.

23:15.031 --> 23:17.099
Did you come
into direct contact

23:17.133 --> 23:18.434
with the liquid inside?

23:18.468 --> 23:20.803
Touch it or drink it?

23:20.837 --> 23:22.004
I smelled it.

23:22.038 --> 23:23.305
You smelled it?

23:23.339 --> 23:25.941
Yes.

23:25.975 --> 23:27.443
Up close like this,
so it touches?

23:27.477 --> 23:29.244
Mm-hmm.

23:32.082 --> 23:33.048
Am I going to die?

23:35.185 --> 23:36.485
No, ma'am.

23:38.121 --> 23:39.054
He's like

23:39.089 --> 23:41.223
my first husband.

23:41.257 --> 23:42.991
Good heart,

23:43.026 --> 23:45.994
and a bad liar.

23:49.532 --> 23:51.467
Looks like
she's wearing a wig.

23:51.501 --> 23:52.501
She probably is.

23:55.905 --> 23:58.111
But you can't disguise
bone structure like that.

23:58.691 --> 24:00.342
I'll run it.

24:02.445 --> 24:03.912
What's the database?

24:03.947 --> 24:05.080
Facial recognition software,

24:05.115 --> 24:06.482
with access to every
police computer in Europe.

24:06.516 --> 24:09.084
Dorn has the power
to give you access

24:09.119 --> 24:10.085
to every city's files?

24:10.120 --> 24:11.286
No.

24:11.321 --> 24:13.522
I wrote a program...
means we don't have to ask.

24:15.425 --> 24:16.558
Here.

24:16.593 --> 24:18.460
Nicole Ryan.
Irish national.

24:18.495 --> 24:20.896
Dancer,
graduated to prostitution.

24:20.930 --> 24:23.032
Been off the radar for a while.

24:23.066 --> 24:24.967
Last Interpol record of her...

24:25.001 --> 24:26.201
She was entering Russia.

24:28.872 --> 24:31.273
Yeah?

24:31.308 --> 24:32.341
Okay.

24:32.375 --> 24:34.357
Radiation levels have dropped.

24:34.477 --> 24:37.546
You've got clearance
to go back into the flat.

25:24.661 --> 25:26.462
Got fingerprints everywhere.

25:26.496 --> 25:27.496
Where are the concentrations?

25:27.530 --> 25:28.997
Where you would expect.

25:29.032 --> 25:33.102
Door handles,
light switches, tables.

25:33.136 --> 25:35.304
Sebastian, point that thing
over here toward the painting.

25:38.241 --> 25:39.541
Do you have ultraviolet?

25:39.576 --> 25:41.076
Ultraviolet.

25:43.413 --> 25:45.381
It's a fake.

25:45.415 --> 25:47.950
Probably painted
over another painting

25:47.984 --> 25:49.118
and artificially aged.

25:53.556 --> 25:55.157
They cut the tracker out
and took the original.

25:55.277 --> 25:56.325
"They?"

25:56.359 --> 25:58.327
The first ambulance crew.

26:08.405 --> 26:09.938
The target is Taylor Reed.

26:09.973 --> 26:11.040
Art dealer.

26:11.074 --> 26:13.342
What can you tell me about him?

26:13.376 --> 26:17.446
Well, to begin with,
he isn't a he.

26:19.015 --> 26:21.517
She left her billionaire
husband two years ago

26:21.551 --> 26:22.451
for a younger woman.

26:22.485 --> 26:26.355
But don't worry,
she's single now,

26:26.389 --> 26:27.723
so you can use
your charms on her.

26:27.757 --> 26:29.425
A woman?

26:29.459 --> 26:30.559
Does that bother you?

26:30.593 --> 26:34.964
Women aren't usually
predators like men are.

26:34.998 --> 26:40.269
Said by the coldest-hearted
bitch I've ever met.

26:40.303 --> 26:43.205
Use what you have properly.

26:43.239 --> 26:45.690
Maybe you and the Russian
can finally call it even.

26:46.676 --> 26:48.644
The Russian?

26:48.678 --> 26:49.645
You think I don't know

26:49.679 --> 26:52.179
why you've been
overdosing these guys?

27:06.296 --> 27:07.229
Sir...

27:07.263 --> 27:08.530
We have our authorization.

27:08.565 --> 27:09.598
Have we heard anything
from the field?

27:09.632 --> 27:10.699
No, not yet, but...

27:10.734 --> 27:13.736
Get Carl on the phone.
I need to speak to him.

27:13.770 --> 27:18.107
I'm not your secretary.

27:18.141 --> 27:19.174
Sorry?

27:19.209 --> 27:21.777
Or clerk or assistant.

27:21.811 --> 27:22.778
I'm a detective.

27:22.812 --> 27:24.379
I belong in the field

27:24.414 --> 27:25.714
with the team.

27:25.749 --> 27:27.516
I don't want to risk
you being hurt again.

27:28.651 --> 27:31.787
All due respect, sir,
that's my decision.

27:31.821 --> 27:35.124
I'm here as an equal member,
or I'm going back to my unit.

27:36.659 --> 27:39.094
It's the first case
after Sienna.

27:39.129 --> 27:43.665
Please, don't...
don't make me hide back here.

27:45.802 --> 27:48.037
Okay, then.

27:48.071 --> 27:50.290
We'll go together.

28:08.767 --> 28:11.472
So how is she?

28:11.733 --> 28:13.774
<i>She has a broken rib.</i>

28:13.809 --> 28:15.776
It caused bleeding in her lung.

28:15.811 --> 28:18.112
That's why they didn't want her
to leave the hospital.

28:18.146 --> 28:19.914
She was supposed to
be in the hospital?

28:19.948 --> 28:21.682
Yeah. She checked
herself out

28:21.717 --> 28:22.683
against medical advice.

28:22.718 --> 28:23.684
Christ.

28:23.719 --> 28:25.186
She's going to be all right.

28:25.220 --> 28:28.122
She needs time.

28:28.156 --> 28:29.390
What about you?
The radiation?

28:29.424 --> 28:30.391
Tests are clear.

28:30.425 --> 28:31.726
And we think we know

28:31.760 --> 28:32.827
what's going on
with the polonium.

28:32.861 --> 28:35.163
Yeah.

28:35.197 --> 28:37.798
The Amsterdam victim
had an original van Gogh

28:37.833 --> 28:39.700
stolen by fake paramedics.

28:39.735 --> 28:40.968
They answered his call

28:41.003 --> 28:42.103
after his glass
of wine was drugged.

28:42.137 --> 28:43.771
There was a metal
tracer on the back.

28:43.805 --> 28:44.805
They took it out

28:44.840 --> 28:46.173
and replaced the painting
with a forgery.

28:46.208 --> 28:47.808
We tracked
our main poisoning suspect,

28:47.843 --> 28:48.976
an Irish woman,

28:49.011 --> 28:50.077
to a fashion show and party

28:50.112 --> 28:51.746
where we she met
the Amsterdam victim.

28:51.780 --> 28:53.814
We have no lead
on her whereabouts,

28:53.849 --> 28:55.249
nor the man to her left,

28:55.284 --> 28:57.251
who she spoke to repeatedly.

28:57.286 --> 28:58.719
His face could be one
of the bogus paramedics

28:58.754 --> 28:59.987
who came to the apartment,

29:00.022 --> 29:02.156
but there's no facial
recognition record

29:02.190 --> 29:03.257
of him anywhere.

29:03.292 --> 29:04.258
Meaning no criminal record?

29:04.293 --> 29:05.927
Not that I can find.

29:05.961 --> 29:08.062
But he keeps bad company.

29:08.096 --> 29:10.398
This man...

29:10.432 --> 29:12.967
Is this man...

29:13.001 --> 29:14.135
Marcus Staam, Dutch National.

29:14.169 --> 29:16.437
Foot soldier, career criminal

29:16.471 --> 29:19.328
with links to a Russian
mob figure named Dimitrov.

29:19.448 --> 29:21.682
Dimitrov? Are you sure?

29:21.802 --> 29:23.544
Yeah, the name mean
something to you?

29:23.578 --> 29:25.412
I know who he is.

29:25.447 --> 29:26.647
Well, our best lead so far

29:26.681 --> 29:28.449
comes from our dead German's
computer files.

29:28.483 --> 29:30.618
He had everything in his house

29:30.652 --> 29:32.486
tagged with high-end
ceramic tracers,

29:32.520 --> 29:34.221
even the non-valuables.

29:34.255 --> 29:36.190
Local police checked
the victim's art.

29:36.224 --> 29:37.791
Turns out a Vermeer was stolen

29:37.826 --> 29:40.894
and replaced with a fake.

29:40.929 --> 29:42.496
Since they couldn't
find the tracer,

29:42.530 --> 29:44.591
we tracked the Vermeer
to a warehouse

29:44.711 --> 29:46.634
about 15 Miles
outside of Amsterdam.

29:46.668 --> 29:48.769
The painting spent
five days there

29:48.803 --> 29:51.372
before being transported
to Saudi Arabia.

29:51.406 --> 29:52.773
Local mapping
suggests it's derelict,

29:52.807 --> 29:55.676
but electrical and gas usage
says someone's living there.

29:55.710 --> 29:58.345
Let's go introduce ourselves.

30:24.272 --> 30:25.539
He's got a tech 9,

30:25.573 --> 30:27.574
and he sucks at basketball.

30:27.609 --> 30:28.842
I've got eyes on Staam.

30:28.877 --> 30:30.010
Copy, Sebastian.

30:31.713 --> 30:32.680
Louis.

30:32.714 --> 30:33.914
<i>Tommy.</i>

30:33.949 --> 30:35.316
<i>Inbound car coming your way.</i>

30:35.350 --> 30:36.650
We need to move.

30:36.685 --> 30:38.585
Ready.

30:38.620 --> 30:40.654
Get your hands in the air!

30:40.689 --> 30:41.722
Get 'em up! Get 'em up now!

30:41.756 --> 30:43.290
Hands.

30:43.325 --> 30:44.591
Now.

30:47.329 --> 30:49.229
I don't think so, man.

31:06.281 --> 31:08.082
I know what you're thinking,

31:08.116 --> 31:10.190
but you're not going to
run over all three of us.

31:14.990 --> 31:17.491
I don't know the girl.

31:17.526 --> 31:19.160
Okay?

31:19.194 --> 31:20.377
I do a job,

31:20.497 --> 31:22.263
I get paid, I go home.

31:22.297 --> 31:24.131
Suitcases are packed.

31:24.166 --> 31:26.167
You going somewhere tonight?

31:27.502 --> 31:28.936
Right now,

31:28.971 --> 31:30.204
you'd better get me
to a hospital,

31:30.238 --> 31:31.172
because if I bleed to death,

31:31.206 --> 31:32.873
you're going to jail.

31:32.908 --> 31:34.642
If you bleed to death,
you're going in the canal.

31:36.178 --> 31:37.144
What kind of cops are you?

31:37.179 --> 31:38.913
Who says we're cops?

31:38.947 --> 31:40.840
You've less
than an hour left.

31:43.619 --> 31:47.922
Do I look like James Bond?

31:47.956 --> 31:49.457
Vials full of Polonium...

31:49.491 --> 31:52.126
Are you kidding me?

31:52.160 --> 31:53.696
I'm an art forger.

31:53.816 --> 31:55.031
I'm a thief.

31:55.151 --> 31:56.364
A murdering thief.

31:56.398 --> 31:58.475
There's no blood on my hands.

31:58.595 --> 32:01.268
It's that sick little bitch
who's overdosing those guys.

32:01.388 --> 32:02.336
That's on her head.

32:02.371 --> 32:04.132
Hers and the Russian's.

32:04.252 --> 32:05.139
Tell me about the Russian.

32:05.173 --> 32:07.041
Give me your gun.

32:07.075 --> 32:08.858
Go on, give me your gun,

32:08.978 --> 32:10.244
I'll blow my brains out
right here.

32:10.279 --> 32:11.646
That's the Russian!

32:11.680 --> 32:13.241
You're scared of him?

32:15.517 --> 32:17.151
You want to know
what the Russian's like?

32:17.185 --> 32:18.519
Huh?

32:18.553 --> 32:20.288
These people you say

32:20.322 --> 32:23.257
are being killed by Polonium,

32:23.292 --> 32:26.060
well, he's only having her do it

32:26.094 --> 32:27.662
to see if it works.

32:29.731 --> 32:31.098
Imagine that?

32:35.070 --> 32:37.213
You're damn right
I'm scared of him.

32:41.009 --> 32:42.977
Do you know who sent us?

32:46.982 --> 32:48.082
The Russian.

32:50.385 --> 32:52.153
You find that funny?

32:52.187 --> 32:55.523
The Russian? Okay.

32:55.557 --> 32:57.557
How do you think
we found this place?

32:57.993 --> 32:59.460
The girl...

32:59.495 --> 33:00.561
who's overdosing them.

33:04.700 --> 33:06.233
He wants her stopped.

33:08.170 --> 33:10.137
Okay.

33:10.172 --> 33:11.505
Okay, all I know is

33:11.540 --> 33:13.975
that it's an art gallery
in Prague tomorrow night.

33:14.009 --> 33:15.343
That's all I know, I swear!

33:16.645 --> 33:18.479
You'd better not be lying.

33:31.249 --> 33:33.551
<i>She'll probably be wearing
a disguise again.</i>

33:33.610 --> 33:35.590
That's why you have that
attached to your ear piece.

33:35.710 --> 33:37.611
It's a geiger counter.

33:37.731 --> 33:39.648
She carries polonium,
she'll be radioactive.

33:39.683 --> 33:41.354
If you get close,

33:41.474 --> 33:42.900
you'll hear a beeping
in your ear piece.

33:43.020 --> 33:43.786
How close?

33:43.820 --> 33:44.854
There's going to be
a lot of people

33:44.888 --> 33:46.155
in a not so big space.

33:46.189 --> 33:47.723
I have the sensitivity
turned down.

33:47.758 --> 33:48.557
You need to be
within a couple of feet.

33:48.592 --> 33:52.695
If I get too close
to that woman,

33:52.729 --> 33:54.263
the hardest thing will be
not ripping her head off

33:54.298 --> 33:56.032
immediately.

33:56.066 --> 33:57.666
Just remember
what she's carrying,

33:57.701 --> 33:58.634
what it can do to someone.

33:58.668 --> 34:00.736
Believe me, I won't forget.

34:03.706 --> 34:04.706
Ready?

34:04.741 --> 34:06.575
She's set.

34:06.609 --> 34:08.909
I'll watch from the roof
across the street.

34:11.380 --> 34:12.848
I'm in.

34:12.882 --> 34:13.882
Want to stop
talking to yourself

34:13.916 --> 34:15.283
and move your ass, princess?

34:15.318 --> 34:16.284
Sorry, madam.

34:16.319 --> 34:18.253
It's going to be
a very long, long night.

34:26.949 --> 34:29.532
I've been close to
every person in the room.

34:29.652 --> 34:31.681
None of the guests
is radioactive.

34:31.801 --> 34:34.188
<i>Not even a bit of a reading</i>
<i>on the geiger.</i>

34:34.469 --> 34:35.637
If she's here,

34:35.672 --> 34:36.737
she must be carrying
the polonium

34:36.773 --> 34:37.706
in a lead container.

34:37.739 --> 34:39.775
Eva, do any of the guests

34:39.809 --> 34:41.710
<i>seem like</i>
<i>they could be candidates?</i>

34:41.744 --> 34:43.844
Beautiful women who could be
Nicole in disguise?

34:43.880 --> 34:45.380
<i>All of them.</i>

34:45.415 --> 34:46.748
She'll have to get
close to the owner

34:46.783 --> 34:47.748
before the night is over.

34:47.784 --> 34:48.850
Stay on the owner

34:48.885 --> 34:50.952
<i>and see who pays her</i>
<i>too much attention.</i>

34:50.987 --> 34:52.654
There's a long list.

34:52.688 --> 34:55.489
<i>Yeah, but only</i>
<i>one of them wants to kill her.</i>

35:02.365 --> 35:04.499
Maybe she was
warned that we knew.

35:04.534 --> 35:06.735
If she was, we may
never see her again.

35:06.769 --> 35:08.236
I know.

35:08.271 --> 35:10.572
Eva, get ready to shut it down.

35:10.606 --> 35:13.842
Okay, major.

35:13.876 --> 35:16.545
Sebastian, can you
turn off the wire, please?

35:16.579 --> 35:17.713
I'm sorry?

35:17.747 --> 35:19.915
I have business to attend to.

35:19.949 --> 35:22.351
<i>Personal business?</i>

35:22.385 --> 35:23.652
What did she mean?

35:23.686 --> 35:25.687
I think she needs to
visit the ladies'.

35:33.296 --> 35:34.529
Hey, guys?

35:40.870 --> 35:42.437
We have a suspect.

35:49.645 --> 35:51.046
I'm following her into the loo.

35:56.686 --> 35:58.954
Pull... yourself...
Together.

36:00.089 --> 36:01.567
Are you okay, miss?

36:01.687 --> 36:03.658
Are you all right?

36:03.778 --> 36:06.659
Yes.

36:16.339 --> 36:18.306
It's over, Nicole.

36:18.341 --> 36:19.608
How do you know my name?

36:19.642 --> 36:20.776
I'm a cop.

36:20.810 --> 36:23.078
Frankie and Marcus
are already in custody.

36:23.112 --> 36:24.913
I'm gonna have to say

36:24.947 --> 36:25.947
I don't know
who you're talking about.

36:25.982 --> 36:27.316
I think you do.

36:27.350 --> 36:29.418
Do you know
what's in this glass?

36:29.452 --> 36:31.553
Polonium.

36:31.587 --> 36:32.654
And no one else
needs to die from it.

36:32.689 --> 36:34.089
Well, then, you'd better
stay the hell back,

36:34.123 --> 36:35.824
or we're both not
going to make it to Sunday.

36:35.858 --> 36:39.394
Put this glass down.

36:39.429 --> 36:40.962
There's a team of officers
out there.

36:40.997 --> 36:42.331
Nice try.

36:42.365 --> 36:43.565
It's true.

36:43.599 --> 36:45.367
A whole team, with guns.
Now, put this glass down.

36:45.401 --> 36:47.769
I think I'll take my chances.

36:48.704 --> 36:49.671
That's far enough, Nicole!

36:49.706 --> 36:50.605
Far enough.

36:52.608 --> 36:53.542
I don't think so.

36:53.576 --> 36:54.843
I do.

36:56.779 --> 36:59.014
It's their fault, you know.

36:59.048 --> 37:00.449
Every one of them
would be alive today

37:00.483 --> 37:03.085
if they hadn't tried to get
a young girl into bed.

37:03.119 --> 37:04.353
No, you pursued them.

37:04.387 --> 37:06.521
They could have said no.

37:08.057 --> 37:09.524
You're all the same.

37:09.559 --> 37:10.959
Men.

37:10.994 --> 37:13.095
You're animals.

37:13.129 --> 37:16.064
You're going to be okay,
all right?

37:16.099 --> 37:18.166
No.

37:21.120 --> 37:23.138
Give me the glass, Nicole.

37:25.934 --> 37:28.043
It's their fault.

37:28.077 --> 37:30.045
Their fault!

37:30.079 --> 37:31.580
Okay, now,
you give him the glass...

37:31.614 --> 37:32.748
- Give me the glass...
- No!

37:32.833 --> 37:33.800
Get back!

37:33.834 --> 37:35.601
All of you!

37:35.636 --> 37:37.509
I'll break it.
I'll kill you all.

37:37.629 --> 37:38.571
You know the polonium
won't hurt anyone

37:38.605 --> 37:40.339
unless it's ingested.

37:40.459 --> 37:41.140
Give it to me.

37:41.175 --> 37:43.476
No, he's right.
He's right.

37:43.510 --> 37:46.713
It has to be ingested.

37:46.747 --> 37:48.979
And I never was one for jail.

37:49.099 --> 37:50.223
Don't!

37:53.854 --> 37:55.688
Help me.

38:09.670 --> 38:11.738
Some night, huh?

38:13.707 --> 38:15.608
So this Russian...

38:15.642 --> 38:18.717
those guys are pretty
damn scared of him.

38:18.837 --> 38:22.494
There's a lot of scary
bad guys in the E.U.

38:22.614 --> 38:24.076
That's why we need
special cops

38:24.196 --> 38:25.496
to go after them.

38:32.415 --> 38:34.154
I'll see you in the morning.

38:40.701 --> 38:43.503
<i>He's a Russian. Dimitrov.</i>

38:43.537 --> 38:46.038
<i>I will make him pay</i>
<i>for what he did to Etienne...</i>

38:46.073 --> 38:47.807
<i>What he did to Etienne...</i>

38:51.979 --> 38:57.517
I'd ask if you're
all right, but...

38:57.551 --> 38:58.651
We're not going to be

38:58.685 --> 39:00.319
those kind of people, right?

39:05.159 --> 39:08.261
I never held someone's hands
while they...

39:09.730 --> 39:10.997
No family?

39:15.736 --> 39:20.807
My parents are both gone...

39:20.841 --> 39:23.209
But I didn't get the chance
to say goodbye.

39:30.184 --> 39:34.887
I saw it on her chart.

39:34.922 --> 39:38.658
Her name was Shirley.

39:38.692 --> 39:40.993
Shirley Doris Potempa.

39:47.167 --> 39:48.835
Cheers, Shirley.

40:00.147 --> 40:01.714
I can't believe you creeps

40:01.749 --> 40:02.682
tried to listen to me

40:02.716 --> 40:03.716
when I went to the bathroom.

40:03.751 --> 40:04.717
What?

40:04.752 --> 40:05.718
Yup.

40:05.753 --> 40:07.787
Well, how did you know
I was with her?

40:07.821 --> 40:10.123
I asked Sebastian
to turn off my wire.

40:10.157 --> 40:11.858
I think it was
the geiger counter.

40:11.892 --> 40:13.159
The geiger counter?

40:15.095 --> 40:17.669
Shirley was right,
you're a terrible liar.

40:17.789 --> 40:18.758
I'm not lying.

40:18.878 --> 40:20.073
You are...

40:34.381 --> 40:35.915
Ciao.

40:35.949 --> 40:37.717
Good night.
