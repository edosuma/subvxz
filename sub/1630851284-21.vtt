What have you done
for the Redfield empire?

Dad, I'm gonna start a religion

Dad, as we speak,
there are 10,000 influencers

10:57.658 --> 10:59.824
at my island music festival.

11:00.051 --> 11:01.401
Too bad the bands
haven't shown up,

11:01.569 --> 11:04.387
and there's no food, toilets,

Hey, R&D's my job.

12:13.625 --> 12:16.067
My dad has done nothing
but ruthlessly build

12:16.219 --> 12:18.052
his empire for decades,

12:18.146 --> 12:19.979
but flipping burgers
with your grandpa

12:20.131 --> 12:21.889
was the first time

12:21.983 --> 12:23.557
I've ever seen him at peace.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.059
That's wonderful.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.820
It's terrible.
He's gone soft in the head.

12:27.973 --> 12:30.231
Really? He seems pretty with it.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.067
Then why would he give a seat
on the board to a man

12:33.161 --> 12:35.144
who tried to make a phone call

12:35.163 --> 12:37.146
with a box of raisins?

12:37.165 --> 12:39.907
Oh, I was hoping
you didn't see that.

12:40.001 --> 12:42.927
Grampa calls the raisins
"phone berries."

12:43.079 --> 12:45.579
But I think this is
a golden opportunity.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.748
Imagine how a progressive,

12:47.768 --> 12:49.583
Earth-loving woman like me

12:49.677 --> 12:52.103
could change the course
of this regressive,

12:52.330 --> 12:54.230

12:55.091 --> 12:57.016
Oh, rebranding.

12:57.168 --> 12:58.759
And not just performative.

12:58.853 --> 12:59.760
(sighs)

12:59.854 --> 13:01.595
For instance, we'd provide

13:01.615 --> 13:03.448
more opportunities for...

13:05.527 --> 13:06.526
...polar bears.

13:08.696 --> 13:10.363

13:10.457 --> 13:11.697
It's so exciting.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.866
My dad is stepping down
and giving control to me.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.368
That's amazing.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.462
It's all gonna happen on Monday,

13:17.613 --> 13:19.872

to force him out.

19:23.738 --> 19:25.163
I married one of those mermaids,

19:25.390 --> 19:27.606
but she was a reverso,

19:27.667 --> 19:29.316
fish head and lady gams.

19:29.335 --> 19:32.503
(laughs) That,
plus a thousand other things,

19:32.655 --> 19:34.730
made me what I am today...

19:34.749 --> 19:36.507
mentally incompetent.

19:36.659 --> 19:39.343
(babbling)

19:41.239 --> 19:45.090
Isn't mental incompetence
grounds for voiding a vote?

19:45.243 --> 19:47.834
Well, as the family lawyer
and psychopharmacologist,

19:47.929 --> 19:50.337
it certainly is.
(clears throat)

19:50.431 --> 19:53.191
Abraham Simpson's vote
is nullified.

19:53.342 --> 19:56.252
The count now stands
at three to three-- a tie.

19:56.345 --> 19:58.345
We'll be hopelessly deadlocked.

19:58.439 --> 20:00.364
The company
will grind to a halt.

20:00.516 --> 20:03.367

Eh, tough banana skins.

I'm so sorry we didn't break

20:20.720 --> 20:22.369
Eh, nertz to that curse.

Every terrible decision

Gus Redfield
was only using Krusty Burger

21:05.098 --> 21:06.839
You can have it back

21:09.327 --> 21:11.418

He was a clown?
