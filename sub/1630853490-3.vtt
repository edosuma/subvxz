WEBVTT

00:30.322 --> 00:31.323
Maya?

00:32.366 --> 00:33.659
There you are.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.537
I couldn't find you.

00:36.620 --> 00:37.829
Are you okay?

00:38.622 --> 00:40.249
Did he die in here?

00:40.332 --> 00:42.709
No, no. He died in the hospital.

00:43.752 --> 00:46.964
His heart had a problem,
and they tried to fix it,

00:47.047 --> 00:50.008
but they couldn't, so it stopped.

00:51.301 --> 00:53.929
Is there anything else
that you wanna ask Mom?

00:56.223 --> 00:57.558
Can I have some candy?

01:00.352 --> 01:03.272
I mean, sure,
they might be a little bit old,

01:03.355 --> 01:05.315
but-- Maya! Wait.

01:07.651 --> 01:10.070
It's just a muscle cramp. Long car ride,

01:10.153 --> 01:12.739
not to mention a dead dad. It'll pass.

01:12.823 --> 01:16.034
You've been through worse
when you were much younger,

01:16.118 --> 01:19.538
just a little girl,
barely older than Maya.

01:24.918 --> 01:28.046
Hey, babe. How you holding up?

01:28.547 --> 01:29.548
Yeah, I…

01:36.096 --> 01:39.183
I just want to get this over with
so we can get the fuck outta here.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.476
Yeah. No, I know. I…

01:42.269 --> 01:44.229
Look, I don't want to explain
your reality to you,

01:44.313 --> 01:46.440
but losing a parent, even a…

01:47.691 --> 01:51.153
a shitty one,
it's a game changer, all right?

01:51.236 --> 01:53.864
When I lost my old man,
even after everything,

01:54.740 --> 01:56.074
it was still a kick in the teeth.

01:56.158 --> 01:59.161
You can't leap over this, Sheil.
You gotta feel your way right through it.

01:59.244 --> 02:03.081
And I am here to feel all of this
with you. I want you to know that.

02:03.165 --> 02:04.249
Thank you.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.544
-Let's go check on Maya.
-Yeah.

02:07.628 --> 02:10.756
I am not letting any of my girls
out of my sight. Not in this place.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.773
I'm gonna go upstairs
and see what's happening.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.525
-Yeah. Okay.
-This is ridiculous.

02:33.904 --> 02:35.280
Does she know what time it is?

02:35.364 --> 02:37.074
Your mother knows the time, yes.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.825
She's very good with time.

02:40.452 --> 02:42.287
She knows everybody is waiting?

02:42.371 --> 02:44.957
She knows. She knows.

03:05.602 --> 03:06.603
Dad?

03:07.729 --> 03:08.730
What is it?

03:10.732 --> 03:12.067
Did you need something?

03:14.027 --> 03:14.862
Well…

03:16.363 --> 03:19.449
I kinda just wanted to thank you?

03:19.533 --> 03:24.371
For when I saw you at the fair,
and I was with Alejandra.

03:24.454 --> 03:27.207
Mom hasn't grounded me
or taken away my Walkman or anything,

03:27.291 --> 03:30.961
so I'm assuming you
maybe haven't told her?

03:35.924 --> 03:39.052
Well, does that…

03:39.928 --> 03:43.807
maybe mean you don't think
it's as bad as--

03:43.891 --> 03:45.017
That's a lot to assume.

03:48.854 --> 03:52.691
There's this dance, okay, at school
and I really want to take her,

03:52.774 --> 03:54.318
and she really wants to go with me.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.363
W-We're going.

04:02.826 --> 04:05.245
I just--
But I kind of wanted you to know though.

04:05.329 --> 04:07.414
And not mom necessarily.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.791
So, you're just telling me
what's going to happen?

04:09.875 --> 04:11.084
-It's been decided?
-No.

04:11.168 --> 04:13.086
Then what?
You want me to be your co-conspirator?

04:13.170 --> 04:15.923
No. That's not what I meant at all.
There's teachers there and stuff.

04:16.005 --> 04:18.759
Like-- We're not doing anything wrong.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.177
So why the need for secrets?

04:20.260 --> 04:22.804
It's a secret to Mom
because it's wrong to her.

04:22.888 --> 04:24.223
It's not, like, wrong-wrong.

04:24.306 --> 04:25.724
I know you know what I mean.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.893
I think you have assumed enough
for the time being.

04:28.727 --> 04:29.728
It's just, like…

04:31.438 --> 04:32.689
I've always felt like--

04:33.982 --> 04:36.693
Well, like Mom and I are so different,
but…

04:38.195 --> 04:43.033
I don't know. I've always kinda thought
that maybe you and me are…

04:52.584 --> 04:54.002
Be sure to get her a corsage.

04:59.633 --> 05:00.968
They like that.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.136
Thanks.

05:32.291 --> 05:35.335
So I'd say that you're, like,
el Presidente.

05:35.419 --> 05:38.297
I'm gonna be, like,
vice secretary or marketeer.

05:38.380 --> 05:41.758
I figure we're, like, on a skateboard.
We go like, "Hashies! Hashies!"

05:41.842 --> 05:44.303
Like, get everybody high
in the entire area.

05:44.386 --> 05:45.804
I mean, I'm saying like, there--

05:46.555 --> 05:49.016
Babe! Just made morning hashies.

05:49.099 --> 05:52.186
Now we're gonna make
some morning hashie sundaes.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.980
You want in? It'll wake and bake you up.

06:20.005 --> 06:23.383
Sheila, for goodness sakes.
What are you trying to do to me?

06:23.467 --> 06:25.344
I just came up here
to see what was keeping you.

06:25.427 --> 06:29.765
I am…
simply trying to get myself together.

06:30.474 --> 06:33.477
It's been quite a week,
as you can imagine.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.561
Well…

06:35.354 --> 06:37.689
-Mama?
-Is that Maya?

06:38.482 --> 06:41.860
-In here, sweetie.
-Hey, hey, hey.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.696
Sweetie, this is your grandmother.

06:44.780 --> 06:46.365
-This is my mother.
-Hi.

06:46.448 --> 06:49.993
Grandmother sounds so old
and boring, doesn't it?

06:50.577 --> 06:52.704
I don't look old, and boring, do I?

06:53.539 --> 06:56.124
Hey, do you like lollipops?

06:56.875 --> 06:58.877
-All right, just a sec.
-No, you know, Mom,

06:58.961 --> 07:01.964
she had candy already today.
She really doesn't need any more.

07:02.047 --> 07:05.008
You know,
I thought that you would like lollipops.

07:05.092 --> 07:09.763
And I was thinking,
maybe a fun nickname for me

07:09.847 --> 07:12.641
could be Lolli, like a lollipop.

07:12.724 --> 07:13.851
Isn't that more fun?

07:13.934 --> 07:15.644
Okay, we should go.
Everybody is waiting for us.

07:15.727 --> 07:17.062
Just-- Just a minute.

07:17.145 --> 07:20.107
Your mother is so impatient, isn't she?

07:20.190 --> 07:22.943
Come with me.
I have another little surprise for you.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.238
Do you know who used to wear these?

07:26.321 --> 07:30.701
Your mommy
when she was just about your age.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.829
Do you think that maybe
you'd like to wear these today,

07:33.912 --> 07:35.497
instead of those?

07:35.581 --> 07:39.418
Sweetie, you don't have to put those on.
Yours are perfectly fine.

07:39.501 --> 07:41.628
Just-- Just let her try them.

07:42.212 --> 07:46.466
Abide with me

07:46.550 --> 07:53.515
Fast falls the eventide

07:54.266 --> 07:59.188
The darkness deepens…

07:59.271 --> 08:00.981
Time to be quiet now.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.025
No more fidgeting, hmm?

08:06.612 --> 08:07.905
Of course she's fidgeting.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.782
You jammed her feet
into those excruciating little shoes,

08:10.866 --> 08:12.618
just like you did way back when.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.161
Why should it be any different now?

08:14.244 --> 08:15.746
-Babe? Can I get you a drink?
-Hey.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.915
-No, I'm okay. Thank you.
-Yeah? Okay.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.960
Well, the ceremony really did its job.
Loosened some things up.

08:22.044 --> 08:23.462
I mean, it's no Studio 54

08:23.545 --> 08:25.881
but at least there's some fucking oxygen
in the room now.

08:25.964 --> 08:26.965
Yeah.

08:28.884 --> 08:30.928
You sure you don't want a drink?
I can make you a drink.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.554
-No, why don't you get yourself a drink?
-Okay, yeah, great. Thanks.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.355
What the hell is wrong with you?

08:41.438 --> 08:43.941
-Poor thing, come here, you.
-We had to come see you.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.068
-How are you holding up…
-It's so rough. The roughest.

08:46.151 --> 08:47.611
…losing your father so suddenly?

08:47.694 --> 08:49.238
You are so sweet to come.

08:50.072 --> 08:52.199
To show off how happy and fertile you are.

08:52.783 --> 08:56.662
Circle of life. Loss. Rebirth.

08:58.539 --> 09:02.209
-It wasn't planned, but welcomed.
-You win the funeral.

09:04.086 --> 09:06.088
I'm gonna go say hello to your mother.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.131
-How do I look?
-Very good.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.635
Oh, God. She looks fabulous.

09:12.553 --> 09:14.346
Mom, still making 'em sweat.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.558
-He's beautiful.
-Thank you.

09:17.641 --> 09:20.811
His name is Ky,
but we've taken to calling him Coyote

09:20.894 --> 09:23.272
because he just howls all night.

09:26.775 --> 09:27.776
I hate him.

09:28.360 --> 09:31.864
I think I got a lemon.
Like, a really bad one.

09:31.947 --> 09:36.451
And sometimes,
I think about tucking him in

09:37.202 --> 09:40.831
just really, really tight. Like…

09:42.833 --> 09:44.459
on his little face.

09:47.045 --> 09:49.381
That doesn't make me sound crazy, does it?

09:52.593 --> 09:54.011
-Period?
-Yeah.

09:55.012 --> 09:56.221
Don't you worry.

09:56.722 --> 09:59.141
Never thought I'd miss that,
but-- Here, take some Aspirin.

09:59.224 --> 10:01.101
-Thank you.
-Yeah, of course.

10:02.644 --> 10:03.812
Tanya Logan?

10:03.896 --> 10:06.648
You better get out of here before
all the crazies come out of the woodwork.

10:06.732 --> 10:07.733
Darling.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.737
I meant to tell you,
Linda Hoffstetler was singing your praises

10:11.820 --> 10:13.488
at the club the other day.

10:13.572 --> 10:15.574
Who? Why?

10:15.657 --> 10:18.994
She had seen your dance tape

10:19.077 --> 10:21.538
and claimed to have had
a lot of fun with it.

10:21.622 --> 10:25.626
It's an exercise tape, Mom.
Aerobics training.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.085
There's no-- It's not dance.

10:27.669 --> 10:28.670
Training?

10:29.796 --> 10:31.215
Whatever for? I--

10:31.798 --> 10:34.468
I don't know any woman
who wants to look like Jack LaLanne.

10:35.928 --> 10:37.137
It's not about what you look like.

10:37.221 --> 10:38.514
Don't do that. Don't let her hook you.

10:38.597 --> 10:40.265
Then what is it about?

10:40.849 --> 10:43.143
Health. Control.

10:43.727 --> 10:46.563
I'm really trying to understand,
but I just don't.

10:46.647 --> 10:49.191
You don't need her.
You have nothing to prove.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.068
Okay, Mom,
I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.

10:59.201 --> 11:00.452
"Dance tape"?

11:02.538 --> 11:03.747
"What is it about?"

11:16.301 --> 11:17.970
I'll show her what it's about.

11:26.353 --> 11:29.231
It's the amount I owe you from before.

11:29.731 --> 11:33.485
I wanted to make good on the loan,
and I just hadn't found the time yet.

11:33.569 --> 11:36.822
It's been so busy.
It's busy and successful.

11:36.905 --> 11:38.031
Believe it or not, Mom.

11:38.115 --> 11:41.410
Despite the fact that you don't get it,
other people do.

11:41.493 --> 11:44.371
And you thought now was the time
to do this?

11:46.415 --> 11:48.166
We just buried your father.

12:15.736 --> 12:21.366
I-17. I-17.

12:26.997 --> 12:32.419
B-11. B-11.

12:32.503 --> 12:33.504
Bingo!

12:34.630 --> 12:35.881
That's a bingo.

13:01.073 --> 13:03.659
Hi. Yeah, I'd like to join
the next fitness class, please.

13:03.742 --> 13:05.869
Maybe that one,
that one that's going on right now.

13:05.953 --> 13:07.120
How much is a single class?

13:08.121 --> 13:10.332
I take it this is your first time
at Vincent's Studio?

13:10.415 --> 13:13.627
Because it's not a fitness class.
It's an experience.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.921
Okay. Well, how much is it
for an experience?

13:16.588 --> 13:18.924
Vincent strongly recommends
you're here for warm-up.

13:19.007 --> 13:20.551
Otherwise, it can be dangerous.

13:20.634 --> 13:24.096
He teaches a low-impact class
for older women tomorrow morning.

13:25.013 --> 13:26.223
I'm plenty warm.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.351
Good luck.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.412
Are you ready?

13:57.880 --> 13:58.881
Stay with me.

14:04.928 --> 14:06.972
Rolling, rolling

14:07.556 --> 14:09.057
Rolling out our shoulders

14:09.141 --> 14:10.309
You got it!

14:10.392 --> 14:12.477
Rolling, rolling

14:12.978 --> 14:14.855
Rolling out our shoulders

14:14.938 --> 14:15.981
Now blow those horns!

14:21.987 --> 14:23.197
Cha-cha-cha.

14:25.199 --> 14:27.826
Cha-cha-cha! Move those hips.

14:27.910 --> 14:28.911
Dance with me.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.956
You know, I couldn't get a single girl
to dance with me in high school.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.834
Can you believe that?
No matter how hard I tried.

14:35.918 --> 14:38.045
-No one believes that.
-But now look at me!

14:38.128 --> 14:39.880
Rainbow the arms!

14:40.547 --> 14:41.924
Five, six, seven, eight.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.346
Roll that lasso!

14:48.680 --> 14:50.140
Who's he kidding with this shit?

14:50.224 --> 14:52.559
Other side! And together!

14:54.561 --> 14:57.814
And breathe and march. Breathe and march.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.942
Breathe and march!

15:01.777 --> 15:03.195
Somebody missed the warm-up!

15:06.114 --> 15:09.117
I strongly discourage
skipping the warm-up. Don't I, guys?

15:09.201 --> 15:11.870
-You can breathe. Just breathe.
-It can be dangerous.

15:13.330 --> 15:14.665
Oh, no.

15:15.666 --> 15:17.084
Nobody can hear you.

15:17.167 --> 15:19.002
-No.
-Now march, young lady.

15:19.586 --> 15:20.587
March!

15:21.088 --> 15:23.674
-Are you marching?
-Yes!

15:23.757 --> 15:26.176
-Are you breathing?
-Yes!

15:26.260 --> 15:27.845
Are you smacking my butt?

15:27.928 --> 15:30.264
Come on. Smack my butt.

15:30.347 --> 15:32.975
Smack! Smack it! Smack his butt!

15:39.606 --> 15:41.859
Somebody's got some rage!

15:41.942 --> 15:46.864
You know what comes next!
Five, six, seven. Hammer curls. Work it.

16:02.212 --> 16:03.505
Hello, dear.

16:03.589 --> 16:05.507
Just checking on you.
Everything all right?

16:08.468 --> 16:09.511
Of course.

16:10.846 --> 16:13.599
Usually, bingo night is
a real shot in the arm for you.

16:15.934 --> 16:16.935
How's that?

16:17.895 --> 16:21.982
Well, you normally come home
with a little pep in your step.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.611
Even put something on the record player.

16:26.570 --> 16:28.947
Must be the chance
to make people winners at something.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.618
Never given it much analysis.

16:33.118 --> 16:36.914
But not tonight.
You came straight down here.

16:38.207 --> 16:40.709
No record player, no pep.

16:42.127 --> 16:43.128
I didn't realize.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.216
Just one bad bingo night.

16:47.299 --> 16:48.884
It's not just bingo night, John.

16:48.967 --> 16:50.969
And it's not just tonight.

16:51.053 --> 16:55.807
Maria, I'm sorry if my mind
has seemed elsewhere lately.

16:55.891 --> 16:58.977
I know you're juggling a lot,
even more than usual.

16:59.061 --> 17:00.562
I-- I am.

17:00.646 --> 17:02.856
But you have always been a great juggler.

17:02.940 --> 17:04.858
Too great a juggler, really.

17:04.942 --> 17:08.194
There's something going on
that's one thing too many for you.

17:09.530 --> 17:12.491
I know you. I can tell.

17:13.492 --> 17:14.952
What is it?

17:15.536 --> 17:17.079
Let me help you.

17:17.162 --> 17:19.330
It's what I was put on this earth to do.

17:29.842 --> 17:33.720
It's Zeke. He's got…

17:35.347 --> 17:39.393
He's got a secret girlfriend, a gentile.

17:39.476 --> 17:41.520
He's been lying to both of us
for months now.

17:48.151 --> 17:52.990
Deep breath. And great work today.

17:54.116 --> 17:55.951
I'm so proud of you all.

17:57.870 --> 17:59.079
You showed up,

18:00.038 --> 18:01.540
and you worked hard.

18:01.623 --> 18:03.876
Here he goes, softening us up.

18:03.959 --> 18:08.213
Let's take a nice, easy sway side to side.

18:08.714 --> 18:10.632
Beautiful job, everybody.

18:10.716 --> 18:12.217
Before he goes in for the kill.

18:12.301 --> 18:14.219
You can get out now before he sees you.

18:15.012 --> 18:16.930
We don't skip the cool down here.

18:17.014 --> 18:18.932
It's the most important part
of the workout.

18:19.433 --> 18:21.185
Come on. Side-stretch with me.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.520
And reach. Two.

18:24.605 --> 18:26.982
And other side. Good.

18:28.650 --> 18:31.236
And gentle head rolls.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.367
And I need to share
something personal today.

18:38.535 --> 18:39.953
Let's bring it down.

18:41.455 --> 18:43.582
And pulse.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.044
I lost a special girl this week.

18:49.379 --> 18:52.424
An angel who took the earthly form

18:52.508 --> 18:54.718
of an Australian Shepherd
named Mary Elizabeth.

18:56.512 --> 19:01.975
And as grateful as I am for her long life
and peaceful passing,

19:03.185 --> 19:07.689
I also felt a terrible urge to reach out
to three old friends of mine.

19:08.857 --> 19:12.152
Three friends who've always
been there for me.

19:13.320 --> 19:17.699
Sugar, butter and salt.

19:18.659 --> 19:20.244
Gentle lunges, keep breathing.

19:21.161 --> 19:22.162
Good.

19:23.747 --> 19:25.249
Do you know what I did?

19:26.875 --> 19:29.795
I came here instead.

19:30.379 --> 19:31.588
I came here.

19:32.256 --> 19:37.052
It's one little step towards a healthier,

19:38.053 --> 19:39.304
better life.

19:40.264 --> 19:41.265
Other side.

19:44.059 --> 19:47.271
That doggie was here on this earth
as a guide.

19:48.230 --> 19:52.067
To teach me that loss is coming.

19:52.693 --> 19:54.319
Nothing we can do about that.

19:55.362 --> 19:59.533
Loss, pain, regret.

20:01.702 --> 20:02.703
Right elbow.

20:04.162 --> 20:05.789
But so is change.

20:07.666 --> 20:08.667
Growth.

20:10.794 --> 20:12.087
Hope.

20:13.005 --> 20:14.965
But only if you show up.

20:15.883 --> 20:16.884
Left elbow.

20:18.468 --> 20:21.638
So make sure you sign up
for a VIP membership.

20:23.307 --> 20:26.310
It's the only way to secure a spot
every week.

20:26.393 --> 20:29.062
And release to the sky.

20:30.939 --> 20:34.443
And you know what I'm gonna say,
and you know it's true.

20:34.526 --> 20:38.113
I love you all, and let's…

20:38.197 --> 20:41.033
Peddle out the calves.

20:41.116 --> 20:42.409
Good.

20:49.166 --> 20:52.252
Wow. I hope you've been sitting
in a sauna this whole time.

20:52.336 --> 20:54.338
-What?
-It makes a lot more sense than the--

20:54.922 --> 20:57.799
Did you bail on your father's funeral
to go exercise?

20:57.883 --> 21:01.845
-No! No, no, no. Not at all.
-You have that glow you get afterwards.

21:01.929 --> 21:03.639
-I wasn't--
-You did, didn't you?

21:03.722 --> 21:05.390
-No, I just-- I didn't.
-Jesus, Sheila.

21:05.474 --> 21:07.809
I was just-- I wasn't feeling well.
And so--

21:08.393 --> 21:09.645
My, God. Are you okay?

21:09.728 --> 21:11.396
Babe? Babe? Are you all right?

21:11.980 --> 21:13.941
-Where's Maya?
-She's around somewhere.

21:14.024 --> 21:15.275
What?

21:15.359 --> 21:16.443
Where is she?

21:16.527 --> 21:18.820
Okay, you are really starting to scare me,

21:18.904 --> 21:21.907
so let's just sit down
for a second here, okay? All right?

21:21.990 --> 21:24.076
I'm gonna get you…
They don't have a lot of food.

21:24.159 --> 21:26.036
I'm gonna get you something to drink.
Stay right there.

21:34.837 --> 21:37.381
Excuse me. Have you seen Maya,
my daughter? Have you seen her?

21:37.464 --> 21:40.759
Have you seen my daughter, Maya?
She was just-- No?

21:40.843 --> 21:44.847
Hi. Did you see my little girl, Maya?
She was-- No?

21:44.930 --> 21:47.683
Have you seen my daughter? Have you?

21:47.766 --> 21:50.060
Fuck! Maya!

21:51.478 --> 21:54.022
Be a good girl and give your uncle a kiss.

21:54.982 --> 21:56.733
Don't you fucking touch her!

21:57.526 --> 21:58.902
Honey, you don't have to kiss him.

21:58.986 --> 22:01.613
You don't have to do
anything you don't want to do.

22:13.876 --> 22:15.419
Jesus.

22:15.502 --> 22:18.547
His hair's longer than my daughters'.
What a pansy.

22:18.630 --> 22:20.424
Please lower your voice.

22:23.552 --> 22:24.887
I miss this ass.

22:25.470 --> 22:27.556
-My little thumper.
-Just-- Okay.

22:27.639 --> 22:28.932
Let's just go.

22:31.935 --> 22:32.936
Uh-oh.

22:36.148 --> 22:39.026
To be awoken by my babe and my board.

22:39.568 --> 22:41.236
What a cosmic gift.

22:45.240 --> 22:48.118
-No.
-Yes.

22:48.202 --> 22:49.703
You're going back with him?

22:49.786 --> 22:52.331
I just can't feel this way anymore.

22:52.831 --> 22:56.835
I am so sick of sand in my hair

22:56.919 --> 22:59.254
and her stupid face in my face.

23:00.005 --> 23:01.715
It is making me fucking hate myself.

23:01.798 --> 23:03.634
It is making me fucking hate you!

23:04.593 --> 23:07.304
Babe. Hate is such a strong word.

23:07.387 --> 23:09.973
I just wanna be on the winning team
for once!

23:10.057 --> 23:12.935
Yeah, you hear that?
You're a fucking loser. Come on.

23:13.018 --> 23:15.229
Babe, you don't have to go with him.

23:15.312 --> 23:17.523
If you need space, we'll find you space.

23:18.106 --> 23:19.691
She took everything.

23:21.693 --> 23:25.739
Then let's take it back.
Karmic retribute that shit.

23:27.157 --> 23:28.992
There is another answer.

23:29.076 --> 23:31.912
Come on, let's go. Let's fucking go!
I'll buy you new shit.

23:32.663 --> 23:33.914
I don't know, Gary.

23:35.916 --> 23:38.877
Are you fucking kidding me?

23:39.503 --> 23:41.421
You're gonna jerk me around like this?

23:41.505 --> 23:42.589
-Again!
-Stop!

23:45.592 --> 23:48.762
Don't you get that without me
you're just some skanky piece of pussy?

23:49.346 --> 23:50.347
You're nothing.

23:51.181 --> 23:52.182
Hey.

23:52.683 --> 23:57.145
In this house, we know that man is
just a tiny little speck in the universe.

23:57.229 --> 24:00.691
But women are on the ground floor,
literally building us all.

24:00.774 --> 24:03.443
They grow our bones, man.
So if you don't listen to women,

24:03.527 --> 24:05.737
you're gonna have a problem
here in this house.

24:13.787 --> 24:14.872
What do you think, Bunny?

24:17.791 --> 24:19.126
Get the fuck out, Gary.

24:45.569 --> 24:47.905
I don't know how she managed
as long as she did.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.908
It's an extremely painful condition.

24:52.201 --> 24:55.454
Imagine one of your testicles
twisting inside you like a balloon animal.

24:55.537 --> 24:58.332
Okay, well,
now that's all I can imagine, Doc.

24:58.415 --> 25:01.293
We couldn't save the ovary.
It was deprived of blood flow.

25:01.376 --> 25:03.795
Right, because of the twisting. Got it.

25:03.879 --> 25:08.300
Good news, other one's perfectly healthy.
One's enough.

25:08.967 --> 25:09.968
Enough?

25:10.677 --> 25:12.012
Thinking of having more kids?

25:12.095 --> 25:14.306
More kids? Sure.

25:14.389 --> 25:16.808
Yeah, we could be planning that.
Yeah, absolutely.

25:17.309 --> 25:20.270
I've seen some alarming levels
in her blood work here.

25:20.354 --> 25:23.190
Yeah, I mean, she exercises all the time,

25:23.273 --> 25:26.818
and I don't really know
when she eats anything.

25:26.902 --> 25:30.197
She's anemic.
I do not like these electrolyte levels.

25:30.280 --> 25:31.281
Yeah.

25:31.907 --> 25:35.369
My recommendation, red meat and rest.

25:36.286 --> 25:37.538
Yeah, okay.

25:37.621 --> 25:40.457
Hey. Look who's awake.

25:40.541 --> 25:42.084
Did you hear any of that, sweetie?

25:44.753 --> 25:45.796
Only a little bit.

25:45.879 --> 25:50.175
Yeah? One of your ovaries decided
to do the twist for some reason.

25:51.176 --> 25:52.803
Why did you say it happened, Doc?

25:53.345 --> 25:55.430
We don't understand why it happens.

25:55.514 --> 25:56.515
Yeah.

25:58.016 --> 26:00.644
He's a really good doctor. Very helpful.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.020
And Maya's okay?

26:03.230 --> 26:05.649
She's asleep, and she's safe.

26:06.400 --> 26:08.318
I'm gonna take care of you now, okay?

26:08.944 --> 26:10.696
You need rest, you hear me?

26:11.321 --> 26:13.866
You are gonna do a whole lot of nothing.

26:14.366 --> 26:16.076
We gotta fatten you up.

26:19.454 --> 26:22.833
Danny, why don't you go get some rest,
and I'll stay with her?

26:22.916 --> 26:25.502
Okay. Yeah. Okay.

26:30.007 --> 26:31.008
Hey.

26:32.718 --> 26:35.679
I thought some ice cream
might feel good on your throat.

26:38.265 --> 26:39.516
Okay.

26:55.991 --> 26:58.035
That's good. Yeah, thank you.

27:04.124 --> 27:05.125
Sheila, I--

27:06.752 --> 27:07.753
Mom, you--

27:10.547 --> 27:13.258
You don't have to say anything. It's okay.

27:22.184 --> 27:23.393
Okay.

27:26.813 --> 27:27.940
Good girl.

27:35.072 --> 27:36.281
It's good, huh?

27:44.289 --> 27:45.290
Better?

27:46.667 --> 27:47.668
Yeah.
