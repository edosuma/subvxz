WEBVTT

02:00.912 --> 02:04.416
Full moon. Lock up tonight.

02:11.923 --> 02:15.268
Better the wolf takes the pig than you.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.816
We lived on the edge of a dark forest.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.070
Few knew our village by name...

02:25.228 --> 02:28.653
...but many had heard of the terrible
things that happened there.

02:29.733 --> 02:32.907
My mother always told me,
"Don't talk to strangers.

02:33.070 --> 02:36.244
Go get water and come straight home."

02:41.078 --> 02:43.752
I tried to be a good girl
and do what she said.

02:45.123 --> 02:46.545
Valerie.

02:46.917 --> 02:49.090
Believe me, I tried.

02:49.252 --> 02:50.754
Let's go.

02:52.881 --> 02:53.928
Shh.

02:57.552 --> 02:59.429
Do you have the knife?

03:00.722 --> 03:02.395
Right here.

03:15.987 --> 03:17.614
Look, snow white fur.

03:17.781 --> 03:19.579
I'll make you a pair of hunting boots.

03:33.296 --> 03:34.639
Do it, Peter.

03:34.798 --> 03:37.221
- You do it.
-No, you do it.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.097
That's it.

03:57.654 --> 04:02.956
I know good girls aren't supposed
to hunt rabbits or go into the woods alone.

04:03.660 --> 04:09.167
But since we were kids, he always had a
way of making me wanna break the rules.

04:10.751 --> 04:14.005
Peter! Trees'll still be there after we eat.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.982
-Give me that.
-What will you give me for it?

05:14.731 --> 05:16.904
-They didn't tell you?
-Tell me what?

05:19.361 --> 05:21.455
They've arranged for you to marry
Henry Lazar.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.922
Well, my mother finally got
what she wanted.

05:31.081 --> 05:32.458
Money.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.171
Henry gets what he's always wanted.
You.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.135
So, what do we do now?

05:39.756 --> 05:41.474
Do you want to marry him?

05:42.551 --> 05:44.144
You know I don't.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.104
Prove it.

05:48.390 --> 05:51.189
-How?
-Run away with me.

05:53.770 --> 05:54.862
Where would we go?

05:55.021 --> 05:56.568
Anywhere you want.

05:57.107 --> 05:58.609
The ocean.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.156
The city.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.622
The mountains.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.294
You afraid?

06:09.452 --> 06:11.079
-No.
-Oh, no?

06:12.664 --> 06:14.041
Really?

06:15.083 --> 06:16.801
You'd leave your home?

06:17.711 --> 06:19.304
Your family?

06:21.381 --> 06:23.008
Your whole life?

06:24.259 --> 06:26.307
I would do anything to be with you.

06:27.137 --> 06:28.935
I thought you'd say that.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.276
-Oh, did you?
-Ha, ha.

06:36.187 --> 06:37.484
Let's do something about it.

06:42.110 --> 06:45.455
It'd be half a day's ride before
anyone knows we're gone.

06:46.615 --> 06:48.162
I'll race you.

07:00.295 --> 07:01.797
The wolf.

07:08.345 --> 07:10.222
This way! Over here!

07:25.028 --> 07:26.826
It killed again.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.535
But we've kept the peace.

07:28.698 --> 07:31.827
Well, the wolf has broken it.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.041
Who is it?

07:34.746 --> 07:35.998
Tell me.

07:36.748 --> 07:38.466
It's your sister.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.053
Mother, Father.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.237
Lucie!

08:09.072 --> 08:10.540
Lucie!

08:57.746 --> 08:58.793
Thank you, Claude.

09:03.126 --> 09:05.970
- Madame Lazar, please come in.
-Suzette.

09:06.713 --> 09:09.967
-I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.348
Let me take that.

09:14.971 --> 09:17.599
- Hello, Henry.
-Ladies.

09:18.391 --> 09:19.768
Lucie was a good girl.

09:27.150 --> 09:30.871
He's your fiancÃ© now.
He's come to offer his condolences.

09:31.029 --> 09:34.329
-But I barely know him.
-You'll get to know him.

09:35.950 --> 09:39.500
Now go down there. Please.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.681
Cesaire.

09:50.215 --> 09:52.388
Come with us to the tavern.

09:53.551 --> 09:56.179
Let the women grieve in their own way.

10:12.695 --> 10:15.369
-l-- l-- I want to go.
-No.

10:22.247 --> 10:25.547
I didn't love your father
when we were first married.

10:27.168 --> 10:30.388
I was in love with another man.

10:31.589 --> 10:34.559
But I came to love your father.

10:35.468 --> 10:40.190
And he gave me
two beautiful daughters.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.478
We should count our blessings.

10:44.644 --> 10:45.691
Come on, Father.

10:45.854 --> 10:49.279
It's been almost 20 years since
the wolf has taken a human life.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.862
Twenty years.

10:51.025 --> 10:55.371
That's because we sacrifice
our best livestock every full moon.

10:55.530 --> 10:57.203
We kept our end of the bargain.

10:58.199 --> 11:00.918
-So now we kill it.
- Yeah!

11:03.454 --> 11:04.580
Let's kill that thing!

11:05.415 --> 11:06.462
No.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.382
I've summoned Father Solomon.

11:09.544 --> 11:11.262
- Father Solomon?
- Ha-ha-ha.

11:11.421 --> 11:15.096
He has destroyed Werewolves and witches
in cities throughout the kingdom.

11:15.258 --> 11:17.010
He will rid us of this beast.

11:17.468 --> 11:18.720
No.

11:19.554 --> 11:22.103
He'll rob us of our vengeance.

11:23.808 --> 11:27.108
I wonder why she was outside
on a wolf night.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.735
Maybe she snuck out to meet a boy.

11:29.898 --> 11:32.617
My Lucie never even
thought about boys.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.950
She was certainly taken
with my grandson.

11:36.362 --> 11:40.037
She used to come by and follow him
about like a puppy.

11:43.912 --> 11:47.962
She found out that night that Henry
was engaged to her sister.

11:48.124 --> 11:50.422
She must have been heartbroken.

11:50.710 --> 11:54.214
Maybe she chose to die
rather than live without him.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.136
How romantic.

11:56.299 --> 11:57.425
Prudence!

11:57.592 --> 11:59.310
It's unspeakable.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.972
She never even told me.

12:04.766 --> 12:06.313
Don't worry, dear.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.979
Henry always had his eye on you.

12:09.395 --> 12:12.114
You're the pretty one.

12:22.742 --> 12:23.914
I'm paying my respects.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.300
I know exactly why you're here.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.131
I've already lost one daughter.

12:32.293 --> 12:34.637
Valerie's all I have left.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.927
You have nothing to offer her.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.969
I have a trade. The same one
as your husband.

12:41.344 --> 12:43.267
I know what a woodcutter earns.

12:44.806 --> 12:47.980
Henry's her only hope for a better life.

12:49.310 --> 12:51.233
If you love her...

12:52.355 --> 12:53.982
...you'll let her go.

13:12.292 --> 13:15.045
We've all seen the bones on the trail
to Mount Grimmoor.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.134
That's where the wolf makes its lair.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.386
We know the weaknesses of the werewolf.

13:19.549 --> 13:23.019
It can't come out in daylight.
It can't step onto holy ground.

13:23.177 --> 13:25.555
-And there's silver.
- That'll kill it.

13:25.722 --> 13:26.848
Silver!

13:27.015 --> 13:29.734
Maybe Father Auguste is right.

13:30.435 --> 13:31.482
Maybe we should wait.

13:33.646 --> 13:34.693
Coward.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.534
Maybe, my son...

13:38.943 --> 13:41.287
...you should find your courage.

13:42.405 --> 13:43.998
You want to hunt the wolf?

13:44.157 --> 13:45.454
Let's hunt it.

13:45.616 --> 13:46.742
Let's kill it!

13:46.909 --> 13:48.582
Let's kill the beast!

13:48.745 --> 13:49.962
Let's kill it!

13:54.125 --> 13:56.093
What's going on?

14:11.976 --> 14:13.944
Come on, boys!

14:14.103 --> 14:15.855
Are you with me?!

14:16.856 --> 14:18.529
Let's go!

14:19.317 --> 14:21.069
Be careful.

14:23.613 --> 14:25.615
I lost my sister. I can't lose you too.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.580
We can't do this anymore.

14:27.742 --> 14:30.336
You have to go through with it.
You have to marry Henry.

14:30.495 --> 14:32.918
But you know I don't want Henry.

14:33.081 --> 14:35.129
Don't make this something it's not.

14:35.291 --> 14:38.295
Look, we had our fun.
That's all it ever was.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.297
I don't believe you.

14:55.436 --> 14:57.530
I made something for you.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.833
I was gonna wait until our wedding,
but, uh ....

15:08.991 --> 15:10.834
Just in case.

15:13.162 --> 15:15.540
You will be happy again.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.668
I promise.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.351
Come on, Henry.

15:28.678 --> 15:29.770
We should wait.

15:30.346 --> 15:32.189
-We should wait for Father Solomon.
- No!

15:32.348 --> 15:33.691
He'll be here tomorrow!

15:33.850 --> 15:36.729
- We're gonna kill the wolf.
- We can take care of this.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.942
That's it? Nobody else?

15:39.897 --> 15:42.821
Let's go! Go home to your mama's, then.

16:09.218 --> 16:13.564
Adrian. Thank you for standing up for
Lucie. That was no small thing.

16:13.723 --> 16:16.602
We'll be family soon.
You'd have done the same.

16:43.669 --> 16:46.263
Promise me you'll be careful.

16:46.631 --> 16:48.053
Don't worry.

16:48.216 --> 16:51.095
The wolf doesn't want me. I'm all gristle.

16:55.223 --> 16:56.850
I mean it, son.

16:57.975 --> 16:59.352
I promise, Mama.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.618
Grandmother.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.908
Oh.

17:14.075 --> 17:16.749
Darling. Darling.

17:16.911 --> 17:18.208
Come.

17:18.955 --> 17:20.582
Careful.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.509
There are so many things
she didn't tell me.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.809
And I'm her sister. I should've known.

17:32.301 --> 17:33.928
That was her choice.

17:35.930 --> 17:38.399
We all have secrets.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.984
Remember what my grandma
used to say:

17:50.611 --> 17:55.833
-"All sorrows are less with bread."
-"Less with bread."

18:15.344 --> 18:17.597
Here. Try this.

18:29.859 --> 18:31.702
How beautiful.

18:37.033 --> 18:39.786
I was making it for your wedding.

18:48.377 --> 18:51.005
I don't feel like it's my wedding.

18:51.714 --> 18:53.682
I feel like...

18:54.425 --> 18:56.553
...I'm being sold.

19:08.648 --> 19:09.865
Right up there.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.419
You better watch yourself.

19:42.306 --> 19:43.432
There's a fork.

19:47.061 --> 19:48.813
Let's split up.

20:16.966 --> 20:18.513
Another fork.

20:19.301 --> 20:20.803
We'll take the steep one.

20:20.970 --> 20:23.598
No. We should stay together.

21:32.041 --> 21:33.509
Good morning, dear.

21:38.047 --> 21:39.970
Morning, Grandmother.

21:43.302 --> 21:47.057
Grandmother told us
that the wolf used to kill entire families...

21:47.223 --> 21:49.772
...snatching children from their beds.

21:50.184 --> 21:54.030
Those stories never seemed real to me.
Until now.

22:22.091 --> 22:23.138
Ripped the thing out!

22:41.235 --> 22:42.282
Claude.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.193
To Adrian.

23:15.561 --> 23:17.313
For his sacrifice.

23:17.479 --> 23:19.322
To Adrian.

23:23.152 --> 23:24.995
Poor Henry.

23:37.833 --> 23:39.380
Henry.

23:41.170 --> 23:43.389
Your father was a brave man.

23:44.298 --> 23:47.677
You know, I was close enough to smell it.

23:48.802 --> 23:52.852
And I was afraid. And I hid from it.

23:53.682 --> 23:54.934
I didn't do anything.

23:56.685 --> 23:57.732
I should've saved him.

24:07.029 --> 24:08.372
-Henry--
-Just leave!

24:10.324 --> 24:12.247
I don't want you to see me like this.

24:48.654 --> 24:52.579
It was Henry's father, wasn't it?
The man you loved?

24:52.741 --> 24:54.664
Lucie was in love with him.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.751
She was a year older than me.
She could've married him.

24:57.913 --> 24:59.256
Why did you insist it was me?

24:59.415 --> 25:01.713
I think you know the answer to that.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.090
I want you to say it.

25:10.300 --> 25:12.598
Lucie was Henry's half-sister.

25:13.053 --> 25:15.431
Adrian was her father.

25:17.474 --> 25:19.943
Does Papa know about Lucie?

25:20.477 --> 25:24.027
No. And you have to promise me
that you'll never tell.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.116
Father Solomon.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.707
He's here.

26:05.481 --> 26:06.858
Claude.

26:29.338 --> 26:30.590
Presenting His Eminence ....

26:31.256 --> 26:33.099
Father Solomon.

26:40.265 --> 26:42.688
Papa.

26:43.685 --> 26:47.360
Oh, please don't cry.

26:47.523 --> 26:50.697
You see? You see all these children?

26:50.859 --> 26:53.203
You see how scared they are?

26:53.362 --> 26:58.163
There's a big, bad wolf.
Someone has to stop it.

26:58.367 --> 27:02.497
Is that the beast that killed our mother?

27:02.663 --> 27:04.916
It may very well be.

27:05.374 --> 27:07.593
Go on. I'll join you soon.

27:07.751 --> 27:09.094
No.

27:09.378 --> 27:10.800
Go.

27:30.899 --> 27:34.153
This is indeed an honor, Your Eminence.

27:34.611 --> 27:39.082
Welcome.
You've arrived just in time for our festival.

27:39.241 --> 27:44.418
As you can see,
the werewolf has been dealt with.

27:50.169 --> 27:53.343
That is not a werewolf.

27:53.922 --> 27:55.765
No disrespect...

27:56.341 --> 28:00.141
...but we have been living
with this beast for two generations.

28:00.304 --> 28:01.897
We know what we're dealing with.

28:02.055 --> 28:04.274
Well, no disrespect...

28:04.474 --> 28:07.227
...but you have no idea
what you are dealing with.

28:09.104 --> 28:12.028
I was like you once.

28:13.567 --> 28:17.617
My wife's name was Penelope.

28:17.779 --> 28:20.703
She gave me two beautiful daughters.

28:21.950 --> 28:24.419
We were a very happy family.

28:24.703 --> 28:27.502
We lived in a village like this.

28:28.498 --> 28:30.592
And like Daggerhorn...

28:31.168 --> 28:34.138
...ours was plagued by a werewolf.

28:35.631 --> 28:40.011
One full moon,
my friends and I got drunk.

28:40.510 --> 28:42.763
We decided to hunt it.

28:43.347 --> 28:48.444
It never occurred to us that we might
actually find it, but find it we did.

28:48.894 --> 28:50.896
It ripped...

28:51.688 --> 28:54.487
...my best friend in half.

28:56.318 --> 28:57.820
Quickly.

28:58.153 --> 29:00.121
And then it was on me.

29:00.739 --> 29:05.040
I hacked and hacked at it with my ax.

29:07.037 --> 29:08.835
Suddenly...

29:09.456 --> 29:11.208
...it was gone.

29:12.709 --> 29:14.962
I had cut off one of its front paws.

29:15.128 --> 29:18.132
I thought it might make a clever
souvenir, and so I took it home.

29:18.298 --> 29:21.051
And there I found my wife...

29:21.843 --> 29:24.938
...with a bloody rag
wrapped around her wrist.

29:25.722 --> 29:27.941
And when I opened my sack...

29:28.517 --> 29:30.645
...the werewolf's paw...

29:31.353 --> 29:32.400
...was gone.

29:36.275 --> 29:39.028
This was in its place.

29:45.867 --> 29:49.622
I told my girls
the werewolf killed their mother.

29:51.248 --> 29:53.216
But that was a lie.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.052
I killed her.

29:57.296 --> 30:00.425
When a werewolf dies,
it returns to its human form.

30:00.590 --> 30:05.391
That is just a common gray wolf.

30:07.097 --> 30:09.225
Your werewolf...

30:12.227 --> 30:14.696
...is still very much alive.

30:34.583 --> 30:38.838
This is one of only three silver swords
blessed by the Holy See.

30:39.379 --> 30:40.756
May I touch?

30:40.922 --> 30:42.265
No.

30:43.759 --> 30:46.433
This is a very dangerous time.

30:47.763 --> 30:50.186
You all know
what the Blood Moon means.

30:53.393 --> 30:55.737
They have no idea what it means.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.838
The orrery.

31:17.626 --> 31:21.881
The red planet converges with the moon
once every 13 years.

31:22.464 --> 31:26.594
This is the only time
a new werewolf can be created.

31:28.595 --> 31:31.474
During the week of the Blood Moon...

31:31.640 --> 31:34.644
...the werewolf may pass his curse on
with a single bite.

31:34.810 --> 31:39.190
During a normal full moon,
a wolf bite will kill you.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.608
But during a Blood Moon...

31:42.317 --> 31:44.945
...your very souls are in danger.

31:46.822 --> 31:51.749
Until the Blood Moon wanes in three days...

31:51.910 --> 31:53.412
...you will never truly be safe.

31:53.578 --> 31:57.628
We're safe now.
I killed the wolf in its lair.

31:57.791 --> 31:59.509
The cave at Mount Grimmoor.

31:59.668 --> 32:02.171
You have been deceived
by this beast from the start.

32:02.337 --> 32:04.180
It made you think
it lived on Grimmoor...

32:04.339 --> 32:08.310
...so that you would not look for it
in the most obvious place.

32:09.428 --> 32:11.806
The wolf lives here.

32:13.140 --> 32:14.517
In this village.

32:15.016 --> 32:16.689
Among you.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.985
The real killer could be your neighbor.

32:20.147 --> 32:22.149
-What?
- Your best friend.

32:23.275 --> 32:24.822
Even your wife.

32:36.663 --> 32:38.631
-Barricade the village.
-You can't do that!

32:38.790 --> 32:42.135
Post men at every gate!
No one leaves until we kill the wolf!

32:42.294 --> 32:45.047
-As you wish.
-The wolf is dead.

32:46.131 --> 32:49.055
Tonight we celebrate!

32:49.217 --> 32:50.719
Yes!

33:05.567 --> 33:09.071
Go ahead. Celebrate.

33:10.071 --> 33:12.290
We'll see who is right.

33:23.293 --> 33:25.045
The wolf is dead!

33:28.465 --> 33:30.388
Take it off!

33:49.110 --> 33:51.613
I'll huff, and I'll puff...

33:51.947 --> 33:55.622
...and I'll blow your house down!

34:12.259 --> 34:14.978
Laugh at the little man!

34:34.573 --> 34:36.667
Valerie, come dance.

34:46.835 --> 34:48.678
I'll huff...

34:49.170 --> 34:51.138
...I'll puff...

34:51.506 --> 34:53.508
...and I'll blow your house down.

34:57.804 --> 34:58.896
OW!

35:08.690 --> 35:11.694
I'll just flick this off.
I'll be fit to see the pope.

35:11.860 --> 35:13.112
Papa.

35:17.032 --> 35:18.909
You're my good girl.

35:20.535 --> 35:21.957
I'm so sorry.

35:22.621 --> 35:25.044
I know. Just go home now, okay?

35:50.482 --> 35:53.076
Tricked you. Ha-ha-ha.

35:53.610 --> 35:55.738
Impressive.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.331
Where did you learn that?

35:58.490 --> 35:59.992
Claude.

36:02.035 --> 36:04.413
Claude, come back to the party.

36:18.635 --> 36:21.263
Looks like Rose has a new conquest.

36:40.156 --> 36:42.250
Come on, Prudence.

37:36.504 --> 37:38.131
You left us!

37:38.298 --> 37:39.345
Take it easy, friend.

37:39.507 --> 37:43.512
I said we should stick together and you
left us, and my father is dead because of it!

37:43.678 --> 37:44.975
Please don't do this.

37:48.183 --> 37:50.311
Keep your hands off her
or I'll cut them off!

37:50.477 --> 37:51.945
Peter.

38:16.669 --> 38:18.171
Leave me alone.

38:18.338 --> 38:21.717
What's the matter with you?
What do I have to do to make you stop?

38:21.883 --> 38:23.726
I love you, Peter.

38:26.721 --> 38:29.770
What are you doing with Rose?
You don't even like her.

38:30.975 --> 38:33.398
I don't have to like her
to get what I want from her.

38:33.561 --> 38:35.063
You're a terrible liar.

38:35.563 --> 38:37.736
I know you feel like I do.

38:37.899 --> 38:40.072
I know you're burning inside.

38:40.860 --> 38:43.113
I'll never be able to give you
anything like this.

38:43.279 --> 38:44.826
Think I care about Henry's money?

38:44.989 --> 38:48.414
You have a future with him.
I'm not gonna let you ruin that.

38:50.078 --> 38:51.546
Did my mother get to you?

38:52.789 --> 38:55.417
Valerie, I'm wrong for you.

38:58.545 --> 39:00.013
I don't care.

39:16.437 --> 39:18.531
I could eat you up.

40:02.400 --> 40:03.822
Don't you want me?

40:17.624 --> 40:18.841
Hey, Peter.

40:20.126 --> 40:21.799
Come on, give us a hand.

40:32.805 --> 40:35.183
The only life I want is with you.

41:20.186 --> 41:22.689
So where did you disappear to?

41:23.064 --> 41:25.192
You know all that soft hay
in the granary?

41:42.750 --> 41:44.548
- Run!
- Get to the church!

41:47.380 --> 41:48.552
-Peter!
- Go!

41:54.095 --> 41:55.221
Claude!

41:56.848 --> 41:59.772
You will die now, beast!

42:06.357 --> 42:09.782
The wolf can't cross onto holy ground!
Get to the church!

42:09.944 --> 42:10.991
The church!

42:17.243 --> 42:18.415
Claude!

42:22.790 --> 42:24.633
Now! Rope it!

42:31.007 --> 42:32.133
Hold him!

42:32.300 --> 42:33.893
Claude!

42:42.560 --> 42:45.154
- it's strong.
-God is stronger.

42:51.486 --> 42:53.284
God is stronger!

43:17.929 --> 43:20.023
I warned you!

43:24.185 --> 43:26.313
I warned you!

43:27.522 --> 43:31.948
Your werewolf is still alive!

43:32.110 --> 43:33.487
Find it!

43:34.612 --> 43:36.364
Find it!

43:38.616 --> 43:39.959
Find it.

43:44.956 --> 43:46.458
Over there!

44:18.614 --> 44:20.912
You can't escape from me.

44:22.243 --> 44:25.122
Oh, my God. You can speak.

44:25.621 --> 44:26.873
How?

44:27.039 --> 44:31.340
You understand me.
That's all that matters, Valerie.

44:31.502 --> 44:33.379
You know my name.

44:34.005 --> 44:35.257
What are you doing?

44:42.013 --> 44:44.516
Human eyes, dark brown.

44:44.682 --> 44:46.935
I know you well.

44:47.101 --> 44:51.231
You dream of leaving this village.

44:51.397 --> 44:53.866
Let me take you away.

44:54.567 --> 44:56.285
You and I are the same.

44:56.444 --> 44:59.789
No, I'm nothing like you.
You're a murderer.

44:59.947 --> 45:01.699
You're a killer too, aren't you?

45:03.159 --> 45:07.130
What happened to the rabbit, Valerie?

45:09.081 --> 45:10.583
I killed it.

45:10.750 --> 45:13.594
I know. So come with me.

45:14.587 --> 45:15.634
No.

45:15.796 --> 45:19.391
Then the streets will run red
with blood. Starting with hers.

45:21.552 --> 45:23.225
Come on!

45:23.679 --> 45:25.306
Father Solomon will stop you.

45:25.473 --> 45:28.272
Father Solomon will die like the rest.

45:28.434 --> 45:31.108
I'm coming back for you
before the Blood Moon wanes.

45:33.689 --> 45:35.032
There! Fire!

45:53.209 --> 45:54.677
You talked to the wolf.

45:54.835 --> 45:56.303
No, it talked to us.

45:56.462 --> 45:57.714
No, it growled.

45:57.880 --> 46:00.474
Wait, you heard it talk to you?

46:00.841 --> 46:03.014
They'll call me a witch.
Don't tell anyone.

46:03.177 --> 46:04.724
No, of course not.

46:04.887 --> 46:07.811
-Get inside onto holy ground.
-Wait, I have to find my brother.

46:07.974 --> 46:10.693
-And my family.
-No one leaves until sunrise.

46:10.851 --> 46:13.855
- Go.
- For your own safety.

46:38.045 --> 46:40.264
We were wrong to have doubted you,
Father.

46:43.718 --> 46:46.517
I've never seen a beast as strong as this.

46:47.388 --> 46:51.894
A creature this powerful must come
from a long uninterrupted bloodline.

46:53.728 --> 46:57.323
Each generation
more potent than the one before.

46:58.816 --> 47:01.194
We must find it in its human form.

47:01.360 --> 47:04.364
But how? It could be any of them.

47:04.864 --> 47:09.745
It hasn't survived this long
by being obvious. Look everywhere.

47:11.329 --> 47:13.502
Look for the signs.

47:14.874 --> 47:16.751
Isolation.

47:18.586 --> 47:20.179
Witchcraft.

47:20.713 --> 47:22.511
The black arts.

47:22.673 --> 47:24.721
Abnormal behavior.

47:24.884 --> 47:26.557
Strange smells.

47:27.511 --> 47:30.606
Your homes will be searched.

47:30.765 --> 47:33.314
Your secrets brought to light.

47:34.226 --> 47:37.981
If you are innocent,
you have nothing to fear.

47:39.065 --> 47:41.284
But if you are guilty...

47:41.817 --> 47:45.287
...I swear by Almighty God...

47:45.446 --> 47:47.665
...you will be destroyed.

47:51.452 --> 47:52.829
He's still alive!

47:54.455 --> 47:55.877
Bring me water!

47:56.040 --> 47:57.212
Hurry!

48:09.720 --> 48:13.145
It's a Blood Moon. So he must--

48:13.307 --> 48:14.980
He's my brother!

48:35.204 --> 48:37.753
A man bitten...

48:38.874 --> 48:41.593
...is a man cursed!

49:17.705 --> 49:19.127
Valerie, open the door.

49:23.711 --> 49:27.090
We're all in danger.
So we've gotta leave now.

49:27.423 --> 49:29.391
Come away with me.

49:32.428 --> 49:34.271
Come away with me.

49:40.478 --> 49:42.401
Come away with me.

49:42.563 --> 49:45.783
Get your things. We have to leave now.

49:47.568 --> 49:49.570
I can't go with you, Peter.

49:50.070 --> 49:51.538
Why not?

49:53.699 --> 49:55.326
I'm sorry.

50:17.431 --> 50:18.774
What happened?

50:18.933 --> 50:23.029
She's going to be all right.

50:24.605 --> 50:28.576
The wolf just scratched her.
That's not a bite.

50:29.276 --> 50:31.529
Lift her head, Valerie.

50:32.696 --> 50:35.119
Here. Drink this, dear.

50:35.783 --> 50:37.410
It'll help you sleep.

50:50.589 --> 50:52.262
You sleep.

51:06.355 --> 51:07.402
What is it, darling?

51:09.525 --> 51:10.947
What is it?

51:11.735 --> 51:13.203
The wolf.

51:13.654 --> 51:14.780
It talked to me.

51:18.659 --> 51:20.002
And you understood it?

51:20.160 --> 51:22.288
As clearly as I understand you.

51:27.543 --> 51:29.295
Have you told anyone else about this?

51:30.671 --> 51:33.174
Only Roxanne knows,
but she won't tell anyone.

51:33.340 --> 51:35.684
She won't even talk to me about it.

51:36.677 --> 51:38.805
It chose not to kill you.

51:40.347 --> 51:42.645
I think it wants me alive.

51:57.573 --> 52:00.577
- No.
-Bring me another bandage.

52:02.578 --> 52:04.046
No.

52:08.334 --> 52:10.632
I have to get clean water.

52:18.093 --> 52:19.891
Has Claude come home?

52:20.054 --> 52:21.977
Nobody's seen him.

52:26.894 --> 52:28.646
There you go, back inside. Now.

52:30.856 --> 52:32.529
You have to let us in.

52:38.572 --> 52:39.915
I saw you with Peter.

52:42.368 --> 52:45.167
I know you don't want me like that.

52:51.669 --> 52:53.421
I'm not gonna force you to marry me.

52:55.464 --> 52:57.637
I'm gonna break off the engagement.

53:15.109 --> 53:16.611
I'm sorry, Henry.

53:27.538 --> 53:28.664
That's enough!

53:28.831 --> 53:30.959
Father Solomon!
We found someone hiding!

53:31.125 --> 53:32.752
In the tower!

53:34.628 --> 53:36.221
Quickly!

53:42.302 --> 53:44.646
- it's my brother! Don't touch him!
-Get him down!

53:44.888 --> 53:46.765
-Interrogate him!
-He's not the wolf!

53:46.932 --> 53:48.149
Look at him!

53:48.559 --> 53:51.779
His speech is twisted.
He communes with demons.

53:51.937 --> 53:53.063
Get him down! Now!

53:54.857 --> 53:55.983
He hasn't done anything!

53:56.150 --> 53:59.996
This is proof
that he studies the black arts!

54:00.154 --> 54:01.201
He's a conjurer.

54:01.363 --> 54:04.287
-I know him.
-Better than I knew my own wife?

54:05.826 --> 54:09.421
You never know
what someone is capable of.

54:09.580 --> 54:11.048
Get him down! Come on!

54:38.692 --> 54:40.285
Give me the name of the wolf.

54:45.032 --> 54:48.332
Give me the name.

54:49.995 --> 54:51.622
Tell me the name!

55:06.804 --> 55:09.808
The Romans invented this.

55:11.308 --> 55:15.233
An ingenious system
for extracting the truth.

55:15.437 --> 55:19.067
How can he give you a name?
The boy can barely speak.

55:19.233 --> 55:23.079
Listen to how he sings
of his love of Satan.

55:25.197 --> 55:27.916
We do this for the greater good.

55:28.075 --> 55:30.419
What's the good in this?

55:34.540 --> 55:38.511
I killed my wife to protect my children.

55:38.919 --> 55:43.174
Our methods of pleasing God
are sometimes flawed.

55:44.675 --> 55:47.724
You had best develop a stomach for it.

56:13.745 --> 56:15.918
She says it's important.

56:20.627 --> 56:23.801
I've come to bargain
for the release of my brother.

56:27.593 --> 56:29.846
Silver fingernails.

56:30.012 --> 56:32.140
To kill a werewolf.

56:37.394 --> 56:38.646
Get out.

56:38.812 --> 56:42.658
Please, I have more than money to offer.

56:58.498 --> 56:59.499
Turn around.

57:07.007 --> 57:08.304
Enough. Move.

57:08.467 --> 57:11.641
Wait, please. I have something else.

57:13.305 --> 57:16.980
Spare my brother
and I'll give you the name of a witch.

57:25.359 --> 57:27.202
Now, that...

57:28.028 --> 57:30.451
...is worth something.

57:33.867 --> 57:37.838
Tell them what you told me.

57:43.126 --> 57:47.302
She can climb the tallest trees.
She can run faster than all the girls.

57:47.589 --> 57:50.593
She wears a red cloak.
The devil's color.

57:50.759 --> 57:54.138
That's nonsense. I made that cloak.

57:54.304 --> 57:56.853
- Silence!
-Continue.

57:57.474 --> 57:59.226
And she can talk to Werewolves.

58:02.813 --> 58:07.068
I've seen it. With my own eyes.

58:12.364 --> 58:15.413
-Do you deny it?
-No, I don't deny it.

58:19.538 --> 58:24.260
And what was the nature
of this conversation?

58:24.418 --> 58:28.298
It promised to leave Daggerhorn
in peace as long as I go with it.

58:31.758 --> 58:36.264
The wolf is someone in this village
who wants you, Valerie.

58:38.348 --> 58:40.601
Do you know who it is?

58:41.226 --> 58:43.945
I'd think very hard if I were you.

58:45.939 --> 58:47.486
Tell me.

58:50.569 --> 58:53.072
Tell me who it is.

58:54.114 --> 58:55.286
Give me a name.

59:00.203 --> 59:03.423
It wants her, not you.

59:03.957 --> 59:07.803
If you wish to save yourselves,
simply give it what it wants.

59:07.961 --> 59:10.680
You can't give her to the wolf.
That's human sacrifice.

59:10.839 --> 59:13.809
We've all made sacrifices.

59:13.967 --> 59:16.561
The trial is over.
Go back to your homes.

59:20.140 --> 59:22.939
I said go home. All of you!

59:25.562 --> 59:29.237
-I thought you cared about her.
-I do care.

59:30.150 --> 59:31.948
I do care.

59:34.112 --> 59:35.580
I'm trying to be smart about it.

59:35.739 --> 59:37.491
Go to the granary.

59:40.911 --> 59:42.458
You're gonna try and rescue her?

59:46.500 --> 59:49.344
-Well, I'll help.
-I'm not that desperate.

59:51.338 --> 59:54.262
Oh, really? Then what's your plan, huh?

59:55.092 --> 59:57.220
See, you don't have one.

59:58.345 --> 1:00:00.143
Look, you've seen those locks.

1:00:00.305 --> 1:00:04.526
I've got a shop and I've got tools.
You need me.

1:00:06.228 --> 1:00:08.947
Okay. Fine.

1:00:09.314 --> 1:00:13.444
But if you're the wolf,
I'm gonna chop your head off.

1:00:14.027 --> 1:00:15.700
I will do the same to you.

1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:18.873
Fair enough.

1:00:22.953 --> 1:00:24.455
Go home!

1:00:26.873 --> 1:00:30.127
Where's my brother? Father Solomon
told me you'd release him.

1:00:30.293 --> 1:00:31.840
We did.

1:01:18.425 --> 1:01:19.927
Grandma.

1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:25.933
Bread. Blanket.

1:01:26.099 --> 1:01:27.772
Do you need anything else?

1:01:32.731 --> 1:01:35.359
I do not want you to use that knife.

1:01:35.775 --> 1:01:38.449
-We have to find the wolf.
- By Sundown?

1:01:38.612 --> 1:01:43.459
Listen, the wolf wants you.
But first it killed your sister.

1:01:43.617 --> 1:01:49.590
No. I didn't know it,
but Lucie was in love with Henry.

1:01:49.748 --> 1:01:53.252
And when she found out
about my engagement...

1:01:53.418 --> 1:01:55.716
...she gave herself to the wolf.

1:01:55.879 --> 1:01:58.632
No. Lucie wouldn't do that.

1:01:58.798 --> 1:02:02.473
- Your time is up.
-But she might have responded to Henry.

1:02:05.138 --> 1:02:07.516
Please see that she gets that.

1:02:12.604 --> 1:02:14.072
Oaf.

1:02:30.914 --> 1:02:32.382
Cesaire.

1:02:34.751 --> 1:02:38.176
I'm gonna save your daughter.
And then I intend to marry her.

1:02:38.380 --> 1:02:41.304
I'd like your blessing in this,
but I can live without it.

1:02:45.387 --> 1:02:46.513
What can I do?

1:02:55.981 --> 1:02:57.324
[KNocKING ON Doom

1:02:58.692 --> 1:03:00.194
We're closed.

1:03:00.360 --> 1:03:01.953
It's me.

1:03:03.196 --> 1:03:04.914
Hello, Henry.

1:03:05.156 --> 1:03:07.409
-I brought you some biscuits.
-Thanks.

1:03:11.997 --> 1:03:15.376
I just wanna thank you
for speaking up this morning.

1:03:16.084 --> 1:03:17.757
Here, try some.

1:03:20.380 --> 1:03:21.848
Yes.

1:03:22.841 --> 1:03:24.184
That was very brave of you.

1:03:24.634 --> 1:03:26.477
I said what I felt.

1:03:27.220 --> 1:03:28.813
You know...

1:03:29.389 --> 1:03:34.441
...I want you to know you're under no
obligation to stand up for Valerie.

1:03:35.145 --> 1:03:36.738
You're no longer engaged to her.

1:03:36.896 --> 1:03:38.569
She's in love with someone else.

1:03:38.732 --> 1:03:41.076
That doesn't mean
I've stopped caring about her.

1:03:41.526 --> 1:03:44.075
I imagine that's just how
Lucie felt about you.

1:03:45.530 --> 1:03:46.952
She had a crush on me.

1:03:47.115 --> 1:03:51.666
Oh, more than a crush. I think she would
have done absolutely anything for you.

1:03:51.828 --> 1:03:56.254
Even agree to meet you on a wolf night
if you asked her to.

1:04:04.841 --> 1:04:06.935
Why are you doing this?

1:04:09.763 --> 1:04:14.189
Do you think I'm the wolf?
Are you accusing me of murder?

1:04:14.351 --> 1:04:17.730
I'm not accusing you of anything.

1:04:17.896 --> 1:04:20.445
I just want to find out the truth.

1:04:23.360 --> 1:04:24.828
It's you.

1:04:26.905 --> 1:04:29.624
My God, it's you.
I can smell it on you.

1:04:29.783 --> 1:04:31.706
Heh. What can you smell on me?

1:04:31.868 --> 1:04:36.624
The night my father died, I could smell
the wolf. It was like a deep musk.

1:04:36.790 --> 1:04:39.543
And I can smell it all over you right now.

1:04:39.709 --> 1:04:44.215
What do you do out there in that cabin
all by yourself in the middle of the night?

1:04:44.381 --> 1:04:46.133
On the night that Lucie died?

1:04:47.717 --> 1:04:49.594
You don't know, do you?

1:04:54.641 --> 1:04:59.317
I know what you're doing. And I'm not
gonna let you turn this on me.

1:05:14.160 --> 1:05:15.377
Oh.

1:05:50.029 --> 1:05:51.997
You're coming with us.

1:06:07.547 --> 1:06:10.551
-I haven't done anything.
-Just a precaution.

1:06:11.050 --> 1:06:14.395
Father Solomon doesn't want
any trouble from the witch's family.

1:06:23.229 --> 1:06:26.199
It's time to put on your harlot's robe.

1:06:48.546 --> 1:06:49.593
Valerie.

1:06:51.758 --> 1:06:53.852
I did my best to protect you.

1:06:54.344 --> 1:06:55.596
You and Lucie.

1:06:55.762 --> 1:06:57.230
I know, Papa.

1:06:59.140 --> 1:07:01.268
You taught us to be strong.

1:07:17.575 --> 1:07:20.454
Father Solomon had designed
the mask for public disgrace.

1:07:21.996 --> 1:07:25.967
And even my friends stared, judging me.

1:07:26.626 --> 1:07:27.878
Stop.

1:07:28.044 --> 1:07:29.591
What if they were right?

1:07:29.963 --> 1:07:32.136
Maybe the wolf knew something I didn't.

1:07:33.007 --> 1:07:35.101
Maybe there was something
dark inside of me.

1:07:35.802 --> 1:07:38.305
You should all go home!

1:07:49.399 --> 1:07:50.901
I'm so sorry, Valerie.

1:07:51.067 --> 1:07:53.320
I didn't mean for this to happen.

1:07:54.487 --> 1:07:56.489
Bless you, my dear.

1:08:05.456 --> 1:08:06.628
Prudence.

1:08:06.791 --> 1:08:08.293
Valerie?

1:08:09.377 --> 1:08:12.130
Roxanne wanted me
to tell you how sorry she is.

1:08:12.297 --> 1:08:16.768
-She said those things to save her brother.
- I know. Tell her that I forgive her.

1:08:16.926 --> 1:08:18.223
Of course.

1:08:19.137 --> 1:08:21.014
But I wanted to say ....

1:08:22.307 --> 1:08:23.479
I don't know what to say.

1:08:23.683 --> 1:08:25.606
But you don't have to say anything.

1:08:26.352 --> 1:08:28.025
But I want to.

1:08:29.355 --> 1:08:31.198
I want you to know that...

1:08:31.774 --> 1:08:33.868
...you may have fooled Roxanne...

1:08:34.652 --> 1:08:36.700
...but you don't fool me.

1:08:37.614 --> 1:08:39.287
Not anymore.

1:08:39.449 --> 1:08:41.702
You were always too good.

1:08:41.909 --> 1:08:44.378
Too pretty.

1:08:45.163 --> 1:08:46.881
Too perfect.

1:08:48.708 --> 1:08:50.506
You tricked us.

1:08:53.713 --> 1:08:56.057
Now you're gonna get what you deserve.

1:08:57.342 --> 1:09:00.061
Prudence, I think you should go.

1:09:00.219 --> 1:09:01.687
Yes.

1:09:02.639 --> 1:09:04.516
It won't be long now.

1:09:06.100 --> 1:09:08.102
The wolf is coming.

1:09:14.400 --> 1:09:16.368
The wolf lives here.

1:09:16.527 --> 1:09:19.076
Your neighbor. Your best friend.
Even your wife.

1:09:19.238 --> 1:09:20.911
You're the pretty one.

1:09:21.699 --> 1:09:23.997
-I could eat you up.
-You will be happy again.

1:09:24.160 --> 1:09:25.753
Human eyes, dark brown.

1:09:25.912 --> 1:09:27.129
I know you well.

1:09:42.720 --> 1:09:46.770
Do you know how you kill a tiger,
Father Auguste?

1:09:51.104 --> 1:09:53.903
You tie out your best goat...

1:09:55.942 --> 1:09:57.944
...and wait.

1:10:53.249 --> 1:10:54.501
Fire!

1:10:57.920 --> 1:10:59.513
-Put it out!
-Unh.

1:11:04.969 --> 1:11:06.516
Go!

1:11:22.528 --> 1:11:24.530
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1:11:34.373 --> 1:11:35.875
It's too much!

1:12:01.234 --> 1:12:02.702
Don't move.

1:12:22.004 --> 1:12:24.427
There! He's taken the bait! Fire!

1:12:25.675 --> 1:12:26.892
Wait, that's not the wolf!

1:12:27.176 --> 1:12:28.519
He's aiding a witch!

1:12:28.970 --> 1:12:31.189
-Fire!
- No!

1:12:31.973 --> 1:12:33.395
Run!

1:12:42.900 --> 1:12:44.402
Run.

1:12:59.417 --> 1:13:00.760
This one started the fire.

1:13:00.918 --> 1:13:03.762
Lock him up. In the elephant!

1:13:03.921 --> 1:13:04.968
-Go!
-Move it!

1:13:05.131 --> 1:13:06.849
The witch has escaped!

1:13:27.153 --> 1:13:30.908
Get over here! Find the witch!

1:13:34.076 --> 1:13:36.704
Come on, Peter's meeting us
with the horses.

1:13:42.001 --> 1:13:43.628
Valerie!

1:13:46.047 --> 1:13:49.347
Valerie!

1:13:54.013 --> 1:13:55.560
Where's Peter?

1:13:56.223 --> 1:13:57.645
I don't know.

1:13:58.351 --> 1:13:59.523
He said he'd be here.

1:14:01.187 --> 1:14:03.155
If he doesn't show...

1:14:04.482 --> 1:14:05.859
...I'm gonna take you away.

1:14:06.025 --> 1:14:08.278
Let me take you away.

1:14:12.031 --> 1:14:14.033
Do you think I'm the wolf?

1:14:16.369 --> 1:14:17.541
Find the witch!

1:14:20.206 --> 1:14:22.083
Come on! Quickly!

1:14:27.672 --> 1:14:29.140
Go.

1:14:30.091 --> 1:14:31.217
That way!

1:14:31.384 --> 1:14:34.513
We should go to the church.

1:14:34.720 --> 1:14:36.722
The wolf can't cross onto holy ground.

1:14:38.349 --> 1:14:41.068
Some with me! This way! Let's go!

1:14:50.236 --> 1:14:52.364
I heard something over there.

1:14:56.867 --> 1:14:59.120
They're in here! After them!

1:15:03.499 --> 1:15:05.467
Valerie.

1:15:15.386 --> 1:15:16.683
Henry. Henry.

1:15:16.846 --> 1:15:17.893
Go. Valerie, go!

1:15:18.055 --> 1:15:19.352
No. I'm not leaving you.

1:15:27.773 --> 1:15:32.449
- We claim sanctuary.
-You are not on holy ground yet.

1:15:33.446 --> 1:15:34.948
-This...
-Unh.

1:15:37.366 --> 1:15:39.084
...belongs to me.

1:16:01.057 --> 1:16:02.229
You want her alive?!

1:16:03.976 --> 1:16:05.023
Kill it!

1:16:20.076 --> 1:16:21.794
Valerie.

1:16:22.620 --> 1:16:26.250
Step across the gate,
or I'll destroy this village.

1:16:27.333 --> 1:16:31.759
Come with me before the sun rises.

1:16:34.006 --> 1:16:36.976
Make your decision.

1:16:37.718 --> 1:16:40.187
I won't let you destroy my home.

1:16:42.848 --> 1:16:45.522
-I'll go with you.
-Don't! Valerie. No.

1:16:45.684 --> 1:16:47.607
If you promise to leave them alone.

1:16:47.770 --> 1:16:50.273
No. I won't let you
sacrifice yourself for us.

1:16:53.484 --> 1:16:55.031
-Nor will I.
- Nor will I.

1:16:55.194 --> 1:16:56.867
I stand by Valerie.

1:17:03.536 --> 1:17:05.129
You can't hide from me.

1:17:15.214 --> 1:17:17.683
-Aah!
-The witch will still burn!

1:17:26.767 --> 1:17:28.690
Under the Blood Moon...

1:17:29.436 --> 1:17:31.188
...a man bitten is a man cursed.

1:17:31.981 --> 1:17:35.360
My children will be orphaned.

1:17:40.072 --> 1:17:41.824
My brother...

1:17:42.575 --> 1:17:43.918
...had children too.

1:17:44.910 --> 1:17:47.754
I meant only to serve.

1:17:49.915 --> 1:17:52.259
To protect us from darkness.

1:18:11.312 --> 1:18:13.360
Under the Blood Moon...

1:18:14.690 --> 1:18:17.443
...a man bitten is a man cursed.

1:18:32.708 --> 1:18:34.460
Where's Peter?

1:18:36.170 --> 1:18:38.013
Where's Peter?

1:19:10.913 --> 1:19:12.415
Grandmother.

1:19:13.832 --> 1:19:15.584
What big eyes you have.

1:19:16.543 --> 1:19:20.173
The better to see you with, my dear.

1:19:26.178 --> 1:19:29.182
Grandmother, what big ears you have.

1:19:30.224 --> 1:19:33.854
The better to hear you with, my dear.

1:19:36.647 --> 1:19:38.194
What big teeth you have.

1:19:38.357 --> 1:19:43.033
The better to eat you with, my dear.

1:20:01.046 --> 1:20:03.219
Valerie. What are you doing out of bed?

1:20:07.845 --> 1:20:09.563
I was so worried.

1:20:16.520 --> 1:20:18.022
It looks much better.

1:20:24.611 --> 1:20:26.363
Where are you going?

1:20:26.905 --> 1:20:30.910
To Grandmother's.
I think she's in danger.

1:21:07.946 --> 1:21:11.917
We're going after the wolf
before the storm can cover its tracks.

1:21:12.076 --> 1:21:15.455
It'll be human again
and we can finally kill it.

1:21:16.580 --> 1:21:17.627
And I have ....

1:21:17.790 --> 1:21:19.963
What? Tell me.

1:21:20.793 --> 1:21:22.295
Peter is still missing.

1:21:24.380 --> 1:21:26.223
I'll do what I have to do.

1:21:28.300 --> 1:21:30.268
Please be careful.

1:22:16.014 --> 1:22:17.436
Valerie.

1:22:20.436 --> 1:22:21.813
Thank God you're all right.

1:22:30.446 --> 1:22:31.538
Where were you?

1:22:31.697 --> 1:22:34.041
I was trapped in that brazen beast all night.

1:22:34.533 --> 1:22:36.501
I finally broke out.

1:22:37.411 --> 1:22:38.708
Don't come near me.

1:22:38.871 --> 1:22:40.589
Valerie, what?

1:22:41.248 --> 1:22:43.046
You don't believe me?

1:22:44.001 --> 1:22:45.048
I'll hurt you.

1:22:50.007 --> 1:22:51.384
No, you won't.

1:22:52.801 --> 1:22:53.848
Please don't.

1:23:25.751 --> 1:23:27.424
Grandmother!

1:23:34.259 --> 1:23:36.011
Grandmother, are you all right?

1:23:36.428 --> 1:23:38.021
I had a nightmare.

1:23:39.765 --> 1:23:41.608
-Ah!
-I'm fine.

1:23:42.976 --> 1:23:44.649
I just woke up.

1:23:45.103 --> 1:23:47.902
There's some soup if you're hungry.

1:23:54.613 --> 1:23:59.289
-I think the wolf is out there.
-it's all right, darling. We're safe in here.

1:23:59.451 --> 1:24:01.670
Eat up. Remember:

1:24:01.828 --> 1:24:05.082
-"All sorrows are less with bread."
-"Less with bread."

1:24:06.458 --> 1:24:08.802
That's right.

1:24:09.628 --> 1:24:11.050
Eat up, my dear.

1:24:12.130 --> 1:24:13.632
What is this?

1:24:28.355 --> 1:24:30.528
Father, what are you doing here?

1:24:31.233 --> 1:24:32.576
Where's Grandmother?

1:24:33.485 --> 1:24:34.657
I had no choice.

1:24:38.991 --> 1:24:41.995
She finally realized what I am.

1:24:51.587 --> 1:24:53.464
How could you do this?

1:24:53.630 --> 1:24:55.177
Sit down.

1:24:56.008 --> 1:24:57.510
Sit down.

1:25:02.097 --> 1:25:04.316
Oh, Valerie.

1:25:04.474 --> 1:25:06.772
I've been so disrespected.

1:25:06.935 --> 1:25:09.188
I've settled for far less than I deserve.

1:25:11.898 --> 1:25:13.024
So I decided I'd leave.

1:25:14.401 --> 1:25:15.994
For the city.

1:25:22.159 --> 1:25:24.127
For richer hunting grounds.

1:25:24.995 --> 1:25:26.212
Why didn't you just leave?

1:25:26.872 --> 1:25:29.045
Because I loved you girls.

1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:31.377
I wanted you to come with me.

1:25:31.918 --> 1:25:34.216
-But you had to wait for the Blood Moon.
-Yes.

1:25:34.630 --> 1:25:36.382
By birthright...

1:25:37.341 --> 1:25:39.844
...the gift would go first
to my eldest daughter.

1:25:40.010 --> 1:25:42.559
So I forged a letter.

1:25:43.722 --> 1:25:45.565
But when I tried to speak to her--

1:25:45.724 --> 1:25:46.941
Henry's not coming, Lucie.

1:25:50.520 --> 1:25:51.817
--she didn't understand me.

1:25:52.856 --> 1:25:57.236
Any offspring of mine with my wolf blood
would've been able to do so.

1:25:57.903 --> 1:26:00.406
And then it all made sense.

1:26:01.198 --> 1:26:04.793
Lucie couldn't be my daughter.
Your mother lied to me.

1:26:05.577 --> 1:26:07.750
But you knew that already, didn't you?

1:26:08.497 --> 1:26:11.876
After all these years of being so clever
and so careful, I just lost control.

1:26:13.960 --> 1:26:15.086
I'm sorry for Lucie.

1:26:15.253 --> 1:26:16.880
You took revenge on Mother.

1:26:18.298 --> 1:26:19.345
And her lover.

1:26:25.263 --> 1:26:27.686
Henry smelled the wolf that night.

1:26:28.725 --> 1:26:31.103
And then again yesterday.

1:26:32.479 --> 1:26:35.278
He thought the smell
came from your grandmother.

1:26:38.110 --> 1:26:41.205
But she had lived
with that smell her whole life.

1:26:45.701 --> 1:26:48.250
You see, my father was a wolf too.

1:26:48.412 --> 1:26:50.915
The smell remained on his clothing.

1:26:53.125 --> 1:26:55.674
Mother never knew what it meant...

1:26:57.713 --> 1:26:59.386
...till the moment she died.

1:27:04.970 --> 1:27:06.222
I loved her.

1:27:07.139 --> 1:27:10.564
Her and Lucie both.
I never wanted to hurt them.

1:27:13.145 --> 1:27:14.442
Valerie, come with me.

1:27:14.604 --> 1:27:16.982
It's the last day of the Blood Moon.

1:27:17.149 --> 1:27:20.449
One bite, and you'll be like me.

1:27:20.944 --> 1:27:23.038
I won't do what you do.

1:27:23.488 --> 1:27:24.660
I can't.

1:27:24.823 --> 1:27:26.996
Yes, you can, Valerie.

1:27:27.534 --> 1:27:31.539
My blood already
courses through your veins.

1:27:32.664 --> 1:27:34.462
It's a gift.

1:27:34.750 --> 1:27:38.220
It's a gift my father gave to me
that now I can give to you.

1:27:38.378 --> 1:27:41.973
I'm stronger than he was,
you'll be even stronger than me.

1:27:42.132 --> 1:27:43.429
Think about it.

1:27:43.592 --> 1:27:46.345
We will be invincible.

1:27:48.972 --> 1:27:51.691
There must be a God,
because you're the devil.

1:27:53.643 --> 1:27:55.691
And you're the devil's daughter.

1:27:58.190 --> 1:28:00.989
You're not so terrifying
when the sun is up.

1:28:02.861 --> 1:28:04.033
How would you know?

1:28:27.469 --> 1:28:28.937
Papa!

1:28:30.388 --> 1:28:31.890
I have something for you.

1:29:17.978 --> 1:29:19.571
Peter.

1:29:20.939 --> 1:29:22.612
Get me out of here.

1:29:26.111 --> 1:29:27.283
OW.

1:29:32.200 --> 1:29:33.292
He bit me.

1:29:40.959 --> 1:29:42.302
When the moon rises...

1:29:45.171 --> 1:29:46.969
...I'll be like him.

1:29:50.135 --> 1:29:51.728
A beast.

1:30:03.231 --> 1:30:04.949
Everything I knew was ripped apart.

1:30:06.067 --> 1:30:08.286
I saw it all differently.

1:30:08.445 --> 1:30:11.995
All the lies. My mother's, my father's.

1:30:14.951 --> 1:30:17.045
He was all I had left.

1:30:17.996 --> 1:30:19.498
Peter.

1:30:20.332 --> 1:30:22.334
Even when I doubted him...

1:30:23.501 --> 1:30:25.720
...even when I hurt him...

1:30:26.421 --> 1:30:28.515
...Peter was true.

1:30:42.979 --> 1:30:45.073
I'm so sorry.

1:32:15.989 --> 1:32:18.583
No one can know about your father.

1:32:19.117 --> 1:32:20.710
They'll hang you...

1:32:21.077 --> 1:32:23.296
...for being the daughter of the wolf.

1:33:26.476 --> 1:33:27.978
Peter.

1:33:31.189 --> 1:33:32.532
I have to leave.

1:33:33.441 --> 1:33:35.068
You won't be safe with me...

1:33:35.235 --> 1:33:37.909
...until I learn how to protect you from....

1:34:11.980 --> 1:34:13.527
I'll wait for you.

1:34:14.691 --> 1:34:16.034
I thought you'd say that.

1:34:42.051 --> 1:34:45.225
It was the most brutal winter
I could remember.

1:34:45.388 --> 1:34:47.937
Daggerhorn fell back
into its old rhythms.

1:34:48.433 --> 1:34:50.435
The wolf didn't come back.

1:34:50.602 --> 1:34:52.775
But the village still lived in fear.

1:34:54.022 --> 1:34:55.865
It was the only life they knew.

1:35:00.236 --> 1:35:01.909
Henry found his courage.

1:35:02.864 --> 1:35:07.290
He chose a life of honor;
protecting us from darkness.

1:35:10.788 --> 1:35:16.136
With time, my mother realized that Father
would never return to Daggerhorn.

1:35:20.215 --> 1:35:22.638
But I could no longer live there...

1:35:22.884 --> 1:35:24.807
...with my secret.
