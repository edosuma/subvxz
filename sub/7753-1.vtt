04:47.420 --> 04:51.210
THREE YEARS EARLIER

04:51.330 --> 04:53.040
â€“ A monster!
 â€“ Run!

04:56.380 --> 04:57.710
Huh?

04:57.750 --> 05:00.210
You sure you
 don't want to run away?

05:06.040 --> 05:09.380
I bet you're a newly employed
 businessman already tired of work.

05:09.500 --> 05:14.080
I ate too much crab and
 transformed into this, Crablante!

05:14.130 --> 05:16.380
Why aren't you running?

05:18.250 --> 05:20.000
You've got a death wish.

05:20.540 --> 05:21.710
Is that it?

05:22.130 --> 05:24.080
Well, not quite.

05:25.290 --> 05:30.500
I'm no businessman. I'm unemployed.
 Right now, I'm looking for a job.

05:31.710 --> 05:34.750
I had another interview today
 and got rejected royally.

05:35.750 --> 05:37.830
I couldn't care less about anything.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.130
So I'm in no mood to run

05:41.170 --> 05:43.670
just because the mighty Crablante
 has appeared.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.380
So, what'll happen if I don't run?
