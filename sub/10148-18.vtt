01:14.951 --> 01:16.661
Hello, Gotham, I'm Ian Peek.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.829
And on tonight's
very special <i>Inside Peek</i>

01:18.913 --> 01:21.082
I've got gossip to shock your socks off.

01:21.540 --> 01:22.792
<i>But first, this question.</i>

01:23.209 --> 01:26.045
<i>Who is boxing trainer Jack Turley
coaching after hours?</i>

01:26.128 --> 01:27.213
- Huh?
<i>- Would you believe</i>

01:27.296 --> 01:28.589
<i>the champ's girlfriend?</i>

01:31.759 --> 01:32.969
<i>I'd watch out, Jack.</i>

01:33.052 --> 01:34.971
<i>She's a knockout in more ways than one.</i>

01:35.054 --> 01:36.055
<i>Mum</i>

01:40.476 --> 01:42.645
<i>And then, there's rocker Jamie Jerald.</i>

01:42.853 --> 01:45.273
<i>She must know
that splicing's against the law,</i>

01:45.606 --> 01:47.441
<i>yet here she is, just a day ago,</i>

01:47.525 --> 01:50.695
<i>meeting with one of the town's
most notorious genetic suppliers.</i>

01:51.570 --> 01:56.033
Maybe hard rockin' Jamie's out to become
the real dragon lady of the music biz.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.203
And now for our headline story.

01:59.287 --> 02:01.706
The strange case of Paxton Powers.

02:02.081 --> 02:04.458
Remember him?
We haven't heard much from Paxie boy

02:04.542 --> 02:07.295
<i>since he took over Wayne-Powers
from his blighted father.</i>

02:07.962 --> 02:12.425
<i>Maybe it's because Pax has been
side-tracked by, uh, personal issues?</i>

02:13.342 --> 02:15.219
<i>Looks like he's making up
for all that time</i>

02:15.303 --> 02:16.637
<i>he wasted in the boonies.</i>

02:16.846 --> 02:18.180
<i>Now, watch this.</i>

02:20.349 --> 02:21.349
Ooh!

02:22.893 --> 02:25.146
- What are they doing?
- This isn't for you.

02:27.356 --> 02:28.941
I want to see.
I want to see.

02:31.610 --> 02:32.610
- Hey!
- Hey!

02:32.653 --> 02:33.904
I don't want you watching this.

02:34.447 --> 02:35.447
See? I told you.

02:35.781 --> 02:37.116
I was talking to both of you.

02:37.575 --> 02:39.118
Come on. It's just entertainment.

02:39.368 --> 02:42.330
You wouldn't find it so entertaining
if you were on the receiving end.

02:46.208 --> 02:47.543
And that's all for now,

02:47.835 --> 02:51.797
but tomorrow I'll have lots more
prime, grade-A gossip for you,

02:51.881 --> 02:53.132
and you'll see it all

02:53.591 --> 02:55.009
from <i>Inside.</i>

02:56.761 --> 02:58.429
All right, everybody,
that's a wrap.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.226
Great show, Ian. Great show.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.479
But you got to tell me
how you get these videos.

03:06.771 --> 03:08.439
It's like you're right there
next to them.

03:09.065 --> 03:10.107
Trade secret.

04:34.525 --> 04:36.569
You sure
nobody's going to find out about this?

04:37.278 --> 04:38.863
If my friends in the tong hear

04:38.946 --> 04:40.865
that I'm talking
about them to the cops...

04:41.073 --> 04:44.076
This room's been swept for bugs, twice.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.328
And you've seen my security staff.

04:46.871 --> 04:48.414
You don't know the tong.

04:49.081 --> 04:50.916
That's why you're here, Mr. Lin.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.626
So I can learn more about them.

04:53.210 --> 04:56.172
But if you'd prefer to face
your tax evasion charges,

04:56.630 --> 04:58.007
I can arrange that, too.

05:04.513 --> 05:07.975
There are about 500 members of the tong
here in Gotham city.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.186
We have interests in sports betting,

05:10.269 --> 05:13.355
gambling parlors, weapons sales, and...

05:13.439 --> 05:14.440
Just a second.

05:24.867 --> 05:26.202
Hmm, maybe not.

05:39.882 --> 05:41.722
Sounds like something's happening
at City Hall.

05:42.051 --> 05:43.969
City Hall? Better be careful.

05:44.345 --> 05:45.345
<i>Always am.</i>

05:45.763 --> 05:48.432
Yes, but you've never
had to face politicians before.

07:27.740 --> 07:28.740
No, don't!

08:06.320 --> 08:09.281
Don't forget,
this model atom is not built to scale.

08:09.698 --> 08:12.242
If it were,
and if a nucleus were actually this big,

08:12.326 --> 08:14.787
these electrons would be
over two miles away.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.165
Any questions?

08:18.791 --> 08:20.793
Mr. McGinnis, you're awake.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.504
Aren't you saying that the stuff
we think of as solid

08:23.587 --> 08:24.713
is mostly empty space?

08:25.130 --> 08:26.131
That's one way to put it.

08:26.757 --> 08:28.842
Then there must be a way
for one solid object

08:28.926 --> 08:29.968
to move through another.

08:30.469 --> 08:33.972
Well, most scientists believe
nuclear forces make that impossible.

08:34.348 --> 08:35.516
You said "most."

08:35.974 --> 08:38.727
There was one scientist who thought
the forces could be circumvented.

08:39.144 --> 08:41.438
<i>He was head of the research department
at Wayne-Powers.</i>

08:42.022 --> 08:44.191
I knew him well. Nobuo Taka.

08:44.983 --> 08:47.069
He developed a theory
called Vibra-Space.

08:47.569 --> 08:51.156
He thought atoms and molecules
could be made to vibrate in such a way

08:51.240 --> 08:53.040
that they could pass
right through each other.

08:53.283 --> 08:54.702
Like that guy from the other night.

08:55.411 --> 08:57.371
But what would Taka want
from that tong gangster?

08:57.996 --> 08:59.456
Taka died years ago.

08:59.748 --> 09:00.748
There was a fire.

09:00.958 --> 09:02.626
It destroyed all his research, too.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.884
<i>“Am Gangsters, they act like big men</i>

09:10.968 --> 09:12.720
<i>until they turn into rats.</i>

09:13.303 --> 09:16.890
<i>That's what tong lowlife, Jimmy Lin,
just did, and I've got the tape.</i>

09:17.641 --> 09:20.018
<i>Here he is, spilling his guts
to DA Sam Young</i>

09:20.102 --> 09:23.063
<i>about the tong's involvement
in gambling, weapons sales...</i>

09:23.564 --> 09:27.276
I'm Ian Peek, and that's all
for this edition of The <i>Inside Peek.</i>

09:29.653 --> 09:30.863
Another great one, Ian.

09:34.783 --> 09:36.223
Having those stomach problems again?

09:36.744 --> 09:38.662
Yeah. It's probablyjust tension.

09:39.496 --> 09:42.249
Well, I'd be tense, too,
if I was out there exposing the mob.

09:45.002 --> 09:47.379
They're nothing to worry about.
I'm untouchable.

09:48.130 --> 09:49.465
That's exactly what I think.

09:50.215 --> 09:51.215
Untouchable.

09:53.302 --> 09:54.502
Don't you have a boot to lick?

09:55.971 --> 09:56.805
You were saying?

09:56.889 --> 09:59.558
I'm saying that you,
or someone who works for you

09:59.641 --> 10:01.602
figured out a way
of moving through walls.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.187
Moving through walls?

10:03.562 --> 10:05.606
If I could do that,
I'd be a very rich reporter.

10:06.064 --> 10:07.065
You are.

10:14.823 --> 10:16.533
Get him! Get him!

10:59.159 --> 11:01.620
Hey!
Hey, let me go! Let me go!

11:01.703 --> 11:03.163
You can't do this to me.

11:03.413 --> 11:05.040
I know the DA personally.

11:33.318 --> 11:34.318
Peek's the one.

11:34.820 --> 11:36.620
He's found a way
to move through solid matter.

11:36.822 --> 11:37.823
You're sure it's him?

11:38.323 --> 11:40.617
During the fight,
he went into a closet and disappeared.

11:44.621 --> 11:45.621
So, what do we do?

11:45.831 --> 11:47.708
Call Commissioner Gordon
and have him arrested?

11:47.958 --> 11:49.585
Arrested? For what?

11:50.377 --> 11:51.545
Well, he...

11:53.213 --> 11:54.213
Trespassing.

11:54.548 --> 11:55.924
Peek isn't really a criminal,

11:56.341 --> 11:57.968
unless being a reporter counts.

11:58.510 --> 11:59.510
Yeah, but...

11:59.845 --> 12:01.430
Um...

12:14.776 --> 12:15.776
Ooh.

12:22.326 --> 12:23.535
Hmm.

12:29.833 --> 12:31.335
Get up, you got to see this.

12:31.710 --> 12:32.710
Beat it, twip.

12:33.045 --> 12:34.087
It's Batman.

12:38.884 --> 12:40.719
<i>“Am It's some sort of cavern or cave,</i>

12:41.219 --> 12:43.597
<i>but What it really is
is a bizarre museum,</i>

12:44.014 --> 12:45.515
<i>a museum filled with mementoes</i>

12:45.599 --> 12:47.935
<i>of a nearly forgotten
crusade against crime.</i>

12:48.685 --> 12:50.354
<i>Its chief curator is this man.</i>

12:50.896 --> 12:53.774
<i>You know him as Batman,
but he has another identity,</i>

12:53.857 --> 12:57.069
<i>one that I'll reveal tonight
on The</i> Inside <i>Peek.</i>

12:57.653 --> 12:58.862
Shway.

12:59.154 --> 13:00.197
But that's not all.

13:00.530 --> 13:03.617
<i>You'll also see the face
of Batman's mysterious friend</i>

13:03.909 --> 13:06.995
<i>and you'll find out what part he played
in Gotham's greatest secret.</i>

13:08.038 --> 13:11.667
<i>A once-in-a-lifetime event,
only here, only tonight.</i>

13:12.250 --> 13:13.752
- Hello.
- It's me.

13:14.419 --> 13:16.338
- There's this thing on the web.
- I know.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.674
They've been running it twice an hour
since before dawn.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.677
- How did he-
- He planted a camera in the Batmobile.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.680
<i>- No.
- I just found it.</i>

13:25.555 --> 13:26.598
Then it's my fault.

13:27.391 --> 13:28.475
It's all my fault.

13:29.851 --> 13:32.437
I always assumed I'd be found out
sooner or later.

13:32.521 --> 13:34.898
It's just galling
that a piece of garbage like Peek

13:34.982 --> 13:36.108
had to be the one.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.131
I was half-expecting you.

13:59.881 --> 14:00.881
Come on in.

14:01.758 --> 14:02.758
Terry.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.514
Once I saw
that the old guy was Bruce Wayne

14:07.597 --> 14:09.433
it wasn't hard
to figure out who you were.

14:10.142 --> 14:11.768
He was the original Batman, wasn't he?

14:12.561 --> 14:13.561
Wasn't he?

14:13.603 --> 14:15.063
I don't care what you do to me,

14:15.564 --> 14:17.065
but he doesn't deserve this.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.817
He's done too much for this city

14:18.900 --> 14:20.694
to wind up in the middle
of a media circus.

14:22.529 --> 14:23.889
He means a lot to you, doesn't he?

14:24.114 --> 14:26.033
Yeah, he does.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.243
I believe you. I really do.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.328
That's the trouble with this business.

14:30.662 --> 14:33.582
You meet so many liars,
you forget what sincerity sounds like.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.614
Wanna say it all again
while I've got the camera running?

14:56.021 --> 14:58.065
Terry. I was afraid
you were gonna miss it.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.398
Miss what?

15:00.817 --> 15:02.152
<i>You know, The Inside Peek.</i>

15:02.360 --> 15:04.321
Everybody at school's talking about it.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.404
And at work, too.

15:05.781 --> 15:07.824
Aren't you the one
who didn't want us watching this?

15:08.158 --> 15:09.677
You said I wouldn't find it
so entertaining

15:09.701 --> 15:10.901
if I was on the receiving end.

15:11.328 --> 15:12.871
Yeah, well, what do I know?

15:27.594 --> 15:29.596
It's gonna be web history tonight, Ian.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.181
Web history!

15:31.723 --> 15:32.723
Count on it.

15:44.528 --> 15:45.528
No.

15:45.946 --> 15:48.365
And coming up next,
The Inside Peek.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.741
<i>But first, these words.</i>

15:50.283 --> 15:53.286
Mom, Matt,
there's something I need to tell you.

15:53.662 --> 15:55.080
- After the show, dear.
- No.

15:55.789 --> 15:56.789
It can't wait.

15:57.207 --> 15:59.251
I... I'm Batman.

16:02.921 --> 16:04.381
Seriously! I am!

16:04.923 --> 16:06.091
Terry, please.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.843
Hey, it's coming on.

16:07.926 --> 16:09.553
<i>Tonight's edition</i>
ofThe Inside Peek

16:09.636 --> 16:12.264
<i>has been postponed
due to technical difficulties.</i>

16:12.347 --> 16:14.933
<i>Please stay tuned
for an encore presentation of...</i>

16:15.267 --> 16:17.435
Postponed? Why'd they do that?

16:17.644 --> 16:19.771
Maybe Ian Peek lost his nerve.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.815
Somehow, I doubt that.

16:28.446 --> 16:30.115
Come on, old man, pick up the phone.

16:38.456 --> 16:40.375
Where'd you go? Where?

16:47.966 --> 16:49.176
Why'd you call me here?

16:51.428 --> 16:52.846
I can't control it anymore.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.806
And it's happening without the belt.

16:55.390 --> 16:56.725
So, what do you want from me?

16:57.392 --> 16:58.852
My body's losing its substance.

16:58.935 --> 17:00.145
You got to help me.

17:00.770 --> 17:01.980
You have the resources.

17:02.272 --> 17:03.899
That company, all those scientists.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.567
There are other companies.

17:06.109 --> 17:08.195
Yes, but Taka worked for yours.

17:08.612 --> 17:10.071
What does he have to do with this?

17:10.405 --> 17:11.948
I was the last one to interview him.

17:12.574 --> 17:15.035
Taka never would have talked
to someone like you.

17:15.660 --> 17:19.080
You'd be surprised how obsequious
someone like me can be when I need to.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.250
I have Taka's files
and research right in there.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.171
I even have the belt he made.

17:28.215 --> 17:29.382
You stole it.

17:30.091 --> 17:31.551
You're the one who started the fire.

17:31.968 --> 17:32.969
I had to have it.

17:33.511 --> 17:34.971
To him, it was just some experiment,

17:35.055 --> 17:36.264
but to me it was power.

17:36.932 --> 17:39.017
A chance to kick my career
into high gear.

17:43.355 --> 17:44.355
You can't leave.

17:44.648 --> 17:45.649
You got to help me.

17:46.775 --> 17:48.985
Give me one good reason.

17:49.486 --> 17:50.779
I know your secret.

17:50.987 --> 17:52.364
I know who you used to be.

17:52.989 --> 17:54.574
You're losing your head.

17:56.868 --> 17:57.868
Wait.

17:58.328 --> 17:59.328
This is it.

17:59.496 --> 18:01.539
The only unedited footage from the cave.

18:01.623 --> 18:03.083
No one's seen it but me.

18:04.709 --> 18:05.709
Take it!

18:36.992 --> 18:37.992
Aah!

18:49.212 --> 18:50.880
{933931

18:58.388 --> 19:00.223
Help! Help me!

19:00.515 --> 19:02.267
It looks like
there's only one force left

19:02.350 --> 19:04.811
that has any effect on him: gravity.

19:17.574 --> 19:19.659
Help me, I can't stop.

19:40.263 --> 19:42.390
Ian, you got to stay solid.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.018
Concentrate. Concentrate!

20:03.828 --> 20:04.908
What's gonna happen to him?

20:05.413 --> 20:07.665
My guess,
he'll keep right on falling

20:07.749 --> 20:09.417
till he reaches the center of the earth.

20:09.834 --> 20:12.170
It's about as <i>inside</i> as you can get.
