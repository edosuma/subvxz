WEBVTT

01:04.200 --> 01:05.519
Monsignor!

01:06.160 --> 01:10.040
-I've prayed for you a lot, Sara.
-Please, I'm begging you.

01:10.120 --> 01:11.520
Come away from there,

01:12.240 --> 01:14.560
come over to me, please.

01:17.040 --> 01:19.360
There's nothing that can't be remedied,

01:20.080 --> 01:21.920
the Lord forgives,

01:22.960 --> 01:24.680
men forgive.

01:29.040 --> 01:30.680
I'd do it again, Sara,

01:31.400 --> 01:32.520
I know myself.

01:34.040 --> 01:35.760
I've hit rock bottom.

01:37.440 --> 01:39.000
I see that now.

01:43.760 --> 01:44.920
I won't move.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.160
But you stay right where you are.

01:50.920 --> 01:52.840
Now let's go back to Rome,

01:54.480 --> 01:58.160
the Church will help you
to disappear, to retire.

01:59.080 --> 02:01.280
You won't exist for anyone.

02:02.880 --> 02:06.000
You'll think of this moment,
maybe while you're saying Mass

02:06.080 --> 02:07.640
in some isolated place,

02:08.680 --> 02:10.479
in a little country church.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.600
And you'll study. You'll pray.

02:21.120 --> 02:25.040
A new life, Ioannes, away from it all.

02:29.160 --> 02:31.240
You can go home to Greece.

02:31.320 --> 02:33.360
Give me your hand, please.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.400
Give me your hand, come on.

02:39.240 --> 02:41.280
Come on, give me your hand.

03:05.440 --> 03:08.880
THE DAY BEFORE

03:14.080 --> 03:16.760
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

03:26.760 --> 03:27.920
-Hey.
-Hi.

03:29.280 --> 03:31.440
So it's true you can't live without me...

03:34.000 --> 03:35.520
What happened?

03:36.000 --> 03:37.440
Nothing. Why?

03:38.400 --> 03:39.720
You look terrible.

03:40.160 --> 03:41.440
I didn't get much sleep.

03:43.600 --> 03:46.840
-So, where are you taking me?
-It's a surprise.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.360
Spadino?

04:05.080 --> 04:06.520
He went out early.

04:06.600 --> 04:08.400
-To go where?
-I don't know.

04:08.720 --> 04:11.800
No? A wife should always know
where her husband is.

04:13.440 --> 04:14.880
And she has to make him happy.

04:16.000 --> 04:16.920
Come here.

04:17.760 --> 04:19.880
Come here, I won't bite you.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.280
Come closer.

04:28.200 --> 04:32.400
Here, take it.
Buy yourself something pretty.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.200
You've got the goods,
put them on display, okay?

04:57.720 --> 04:59.840
And this is the surprise?

04:59.920 --> 05:00.960
No.

05:02.240 --> 05:03.880
We're the surprise.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.960
Relax, I'll explain.

05:11.600 --> 05:14.840
And what is there to explain?
That you're a piece of shit?

05:15.760 --> 05:19.240
You were in on it with them
all along, huh? Asshole!

05:19.600 --> 05:22.520
-Asshole!
-Feisty!

05:23.080 --> 05:25.440
You can fuck off,
I have nothing to say to you.

05:25.520 --> 05:27.160
But I think you do.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.600
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Shut up.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.120
How do we play this?

05:41.840 --> 05:44.720
Think carefully about
where the priest is,

05:44.800 --> 05:46.160
maybe it'll come to you.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.640
I said I don't know.

05:49.760 --> 05:53.160
Is it really worth protecting
that shitty cockroach?

05:53.960 --> 05:55.920
But what do you want from him?

05:56.920 --> 05:58.360
The land in Ostia.

05:59.800 --> 06:01.040
What?

06:02.000 --> 06:03.480
Am I speaking Arabic?

06:03.560 --> 06:05.200
She understood.

06:05.280 --> 06:08.040
You gotta convince the priest.

06:08.360 --> 06:11.760
The land in Ostia? Is this a joke?

06:13.160 --> 06:17.080
The Vatican will never
sell the land to you three.

06:17.160 --> 06:18.200
Why?

06:19.560 --> 06:23.240
We're talking about priests here.
They always do what the fuck they want.

06:23.840 --> 06:25.240
You're crazy.

06:26.680 --> 06:29.320
We're getting that land or no one is.

06:31.440 --> 06:33.480
Now cough up where the priest is.

06:38.240 --> 06:40.360
Now you're pissing me off, come here.

06:41.600 --> 06:44.240
You don't tell me where he is,
I'll shoot you in the face,

06:44.320 --> 06:45.560
throw you in the river
and no one will find you.

06:47.080 --> 06:48.680
And then what will you do?

06:49.800 --> 06:52.760
I know the Vatican. I know how they think.

06:52.840 --> 06:55.160
I know my way around in there.

06:55.240 --> 06:58.280
I can even bring you in on the deal,

06:58.360 --> 07:01.640
but I need some time
to figure out how.

07:01.720 --> 07:02.960
You're wasting time.

07:03.040 --> 07:04.680
Maybe we should do what she says.

07:05.320 --> 07:07.560
She's right, she knows those people.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.440
Besides, what have we got to lose?

07:11.520 --> 07:14.240
Maybe she'll find a solution
that makes everyone happy.

07:15.760 --> 07:17.640
We can always get her back if we need to.

07:23.280 --> 07:25.200
If she does anything dumb, it's your ass.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.560
And you, better hustle.

08:38.840 --> 08:40.840
Hi, Stefano, may I?

08:41.960 --> 08:43.320
My coat.

08:46.520 --> 08:47.680
How are you?

08:48.800 --> 08:52.640
-You look older.
-And you look like the same old asshole.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.840
No, I've aged too.

08:54.920 --> 08:56.720
If you don't mind, I'd like to eat.

08:56.800 --> 08:59.520
-I'll keep you company.
-I'd rather eat alone.

09:01.320 --> 09:03.280
What about the time you ate
with Ferinelli?

09:05.040 --> 09:08.560
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-I think you do.

09:09.920 --> 09:12.680
Remember that odd lunch
you organized years ago?

09:13.240 --> 09:16.760
With that special lobbyist,
a great supporter of wind power...

09:17.640 --> 09:19.480
It was talked about a lot at the time.

09:20.080 --> 09:23.040
But it all came to nothing,
even the photos of you together.

09:23.720 --> 09:26.760
Shortly afterwards,
the blades started to turn all over Italy.

09:26.840 --> 09:28.800
You know what they say, right?

09:28.880 --> 09:31.800
It's a sin to think ill of someone,
but often it's right.

09:32.720 --> 09:36.320
-Get the fuck out of here, Amedeo.
-No.

09:37.080 --> 09:40.040
I want you to use all this power
you've acquired over the years

09:40.120 --> 09:42.800
to give direction of the museums
of Rome to a common friend.

09:42.880 --> 09:44.080
You're out of your mind.

09:45.760 --> 09:48.480
Come on, aren't you curious to know
who the friend is?

09:49.440 --> 09:50.360
It's Taccon.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.920
Poor Taccon has always wanted that job,

09:54.000 --> 09:57.080
except the party had other plans,
other people to make happy.

09:57.160 --> 10:00.520
Have you really sold your soul to
the devil for two bits of land in Ostia?

10:00.600 --> 10:02.040
The devil's got yours too.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.920
How much did they give you
to get those blades turning?

10:06.240 --> 10:09.040
You're a loser, Cinaglia,
and you bluff like a loser.

10:09.120 --> 10:10.280
You've got nothing,

10:10.360 --> 10:14.520
only rumors from the past that
you evidently still haven't let go of.

10:14.600 --> 10:17.160
-It was a pleasure seeing you again.
-Not for me.

10:17.240 --> 10:21.280
Better than the last time we met, right?
I smashed your face in.

10:24.640 --> 10:27.480
The last time we met,
I took your wife away from you.

10:29.880 --> 10:32.160
So, let's see what happens next time.

10:40.200 --> 10:43.520
I look forward to hearing from you,
let's say, tonight.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.760
-Sara, let's talk about it.
-Shut up!

11:09.840 --> 11:12.400
-I'm really sorry.
-I told you to shut up!

11:13.160 --> 11:14.840
I can't believe it.

11:14.920 --> 11:17.000
You were scheming with them all along.

11:17.080 --> 11:20.400
You sold me out to those two.
Who the fuck are you, Lele?

11:20.480 --> 11:23.320
I had no choice, you've got
no idea what a shitstorm I'm in.

11:23.400 --> 11:26.720
You used me
because you saw an opportunity

11:26.800 --> 11:28.720
and now you're involved with those two,

11:28.800 --> 11:31.640
but when you find something better,
you'll drop them too.

11:31.720 --> 11:32.920
You're a piece of shit!

11:33.000 --> 11:36.480
I'm like you, someone who uses people,
then throws them away.

11:45.320 --> 11:47.480
Tell your little pals that I'll call them!

11:52.880 --> 11:55.800
She's almost got more balls
than my sister.

11:56.280 --> 11:59.880
-Do you like her?
-What? Lele's banging her.

11:59.960 --> 12:01.720
Was banging, because I think now...

12:02.720 --> 12:06.360
-So you like her.
-Don't act jealous, you're not good at it.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.240
Have you got something clean I can borrow?

12:13.640 --> 12:17.080
Anyway, I'm looking for somewhere to live,
I'll be out of here soon.

12:19.960 --> 12:21.280
Whose is this?

12:21.840 --> 12:23.560
Now you're the one acting jealous.

12:23.960 --> 12:27.240
-But you didn't tell me whose it is.
-What do you care?

12:29.440 --> 12:31.240
Look, it's clean, you jerk.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.560
Why don't you stay here?

12:45.880 --> 12:47.640
I like it when you're here.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.080
See ya.

13:01.400 --> 13:02.600
Fuck you.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.000
Here you are.

13:20.080 --> 13:22.120
I got here as soon as I could.
What happened?

13:22.200 --> 13:23.320
Not here, let's go.

13:28.280 --> 13:31.280
Sandro, that's not the point,
we've got to get what we want.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.400
-You still believe that.
-There's a solution.

13:34.120 --> 13:37.560
We have to get those three into
the company, give them some shares.

13:37.640 --> 13:41.040
-What the fuck are you talking about?
-Think about it.

13:43.360 --> 13:45.640
Our company is going bankrupt,

13:45.720 --> 13:49.040
if we obey Samurai's orders
he won't even leave us the crumbs.

13:50.400 --> 13:53.200
But with them, maybe we've got a chance.

13:53.280 --> 13:56.760
You're out of your mind, do you know
who they are? They don't mess around.

13:57.320 --> 13:58.400
As soon as they're in the deal,

13:58.480 --> 14:00.720
they'll take everything,
just like Samurai.

14:00.800 --> 14:04.240
But they don't even know
what a company is, they're just kids.

14:04.680 --> 14:07.400
It won't be difficult to manage
and get them to do what we want.

14:07.480 --> 14:10.600
And what do we tell Samurai?
Or you think you can manage him too?

14:10.680 --> 14:13.640
They're how we're going to stop Samurai.

14:15.720 --> 14:17.600
They're up for anything.

14:18.800 --> 14:22.560
They'll stop at nothing,
not even at him.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.240
We'll give those kids some shares
and keep them on our side,

14:30.680 --> 14:34.760
then we'll get Theodosiou
to sign the land over to our company.

14:37.760 --> 14:39.000
At that point, we can...

14:41.720 --> 14:43.040
Don't say anything else.

14:50.560 --> 14:51.920
Go and play.

14:59.360 --> 15:01.600
-Where are you going?
-Shopping.

15:01.680 --> 15:04.600
-Does Spadino know?
-I need to buy some clothes.

15:04.680 --> 15:07.400
Pretty things to make Spadino happy.

15:08.120 --> 15:09.600
Did he ask you to?

15:09.920 --> 15:11.440
No, I'll surprise him.

15:12.960 --> 15:16.440
-Take some money, then.
-No, I've got some, thanks.

15:18.440 --> 15:20.000
But you're not going alone.

15:20.880 --> 15:22.120
Mercedes?

15:22.720 --> 15:23.760
Come here.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.840
-Go with her.
-All right.

15:37.800 --> 15:39.840
Damn, you're so beautiful.

15:41.680 --> 15:42.960
What's wrong?

15:43.920 --> 15:45.160
Nothing.

15:46.240 --> 15:48.760
Aureliano was always
the looker in the family.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.200
The spitting image of Mom.

15:55.520 --> 15:57.360
Do you still remember her?

15:59.040 --> 16:00.160
Yes.

16:07.360 --> 16:10.440
Relax, Livia, you did the right thing.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.360
For you and for him.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.040
-Where are you going?
-Did you hear?

16:19.720 --> 16:21.720
-Yeah, but where are you going?
-Over there.

16:34.680 --> 16:36.200
What are you doing here?

16:36.600 --> 16:37.760
Can't you see?

16:41.520 --> 16:43.360
And anyway, this is my house, too...

16:48.040 --> 16:51.480
-What the fuck are you doing here?
-Drop it, Aureliano.

16:51.560 --> 16:54.760
You think because you're fucking
my sister you can talk to me?

16:54.840 --> 16:57.920
Please, go back in there.

17:02.040 --> 17:02.960
Go.

17:14.760 --> 17:16.200
How are you, Aureliano?

17:16.960 --> 17:19.520
How can you fuck that parasite?

17:19.800 --> 17:21.800
Since when do you care who I fuck?

17:23.880 --> 17:27.440
-He's just here for our cash, you know?
-And why are you here?

17:27.880 --> 17:29.280
Got no answer, huh?

17:29.360 --> 17:32.680
About Quirino? About what?
It's none of your fucking business.

17:35.840 --> 17:37.240
Where are you staying?

17:38.360 --> 17:39.960
None of your fucking business.

17:45.080 --> 17:46.720
I'm sorry you left.

17:48.120 --> 17:49.480
I didn't leave,

17:50.480 --> 17:51.840
you kicked me out.

17:53.480 --> 17:55.960
And you got together with that asshole.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.960
Now that Tullio’s dead,
we have to take advantage and grow.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.840
We have to take turf from the Adamis.

18:10.240 --> 18:13.320
United we're stronger,
we need to make ourselves heard.

18:13.400 --> 18:14.760
Got any ideas?

18:16.120 --> 18:19.640
Vincenzo, we should start with something
small and see how they react.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.920
And it's time we work together.

18:22.440 --> 18:24.000
If you need some guys, just ask.

18:27.520 --> 18:29.000
How's my Angelica?

18:31.520 --> 18:33.360
Like a queen.

18:41.640 --> 18:43.000
Come in and close the door.

18:46.240 --> 18:48.360
Why do you want
Taccon to have that job?

18:49.200 --> 18:52.160
-Because he deserves it.
-Yeah, right... stop it.

18:53.520 --> 18:55.400
Who's behind it, Amedeo?

18:55.480 --> 18:58.240
-Behind what?
-Amedeo, who's behind it?

19:02.240 --> 19:03.280
Samurai.

19:07.040 --> 19:08.840
-Fuck!
-It's not allowed.

19:09.280 --> 19:10.760
We're in a public office.

19:12.640 --> 19:14.640
You're on the payroll of a criminal...

19:15.560 --> 19:18.560
No, I work with someone who does
business with everyone in Rome,

19:18.640 --> 19:20.120
including the Party.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.400
And you, why are you here?

19:24.480 --> 19:28.400
Stefano wanted to report you
for attempted blackmail.

19:28.480 --> 19:30.200
Maybe I was wrong to stop him.

19:30.280 --> 19:34.480
I always liked Stefano,
the best politician of his generation,

19:34.560 --> 19:37.920
the most informed, the most intelligent,
the most charismatic.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.320
The best of all of us, no doubt.

19:42.560 --> 19:45.160
You still can't stand that I chose him?

19:46.520 --> 19:48.840
You chose a corrupt man, Gabriella.

19:51.320 --> 19:53.000
Tell me that you didn't know.

19:56.160 --> 19:58.560
You and I have nothing more
to say to each other.

20:09.680 --> 20:13.240
I'll make sure the Vatican
sells its land to my husband's company,

20:13.640 --> 20:15.680
and I'll transfer some shares to you.

20:16.320 --> 20:19.480
-And what does that mean?
-That we become partners.

20:20.440 --> 20:23.040
-Partners?
-It's the only solution.

20:23.120 --> 20:25.040
The Vatican will never sell to you.

20:25.720 --> 20:27.360
What shares? How many?

20:27.880 --> 20:29.280
Fifty percent.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.480
Let's make it 60%, there's three of us...

20:35.040 --> 20:36.440
It's an easier split, right?

20:39.080 --> 20:40.120
All right.

20:41.160 --> 20:42.360
Go on.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.200
Samurai wants that land, too.

20:46.520 --> 20:48.400
Out with it. What do you mean?

20:49.560 --> 20:51.440
Got fuck all to say, Gabriele?

20:52.680 --> 20:55.600
-What am I supposed to say?
-You still don't get what she wants?

20:55.680 --> 20:57.640
-She wants to go into business with us.
-Yeah, my ass.

20:58.880 --> 21:00.640
She wants us to kill Samurai.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.040
Is that true?

21:06.280 --> 21:10.840
I need to be sure that going into
business with you is the best option.

21:12.640 --> 21:15.480
You want to kill someone
and you're embarrassed to say it.

21:17.240 --> 21:20.880
Then let's forget it, out the monsignor
and no one does the deal.

21:20.960 --> 21:23.200
No, we're doing the deal, for sure.

21:24.040 --> 21:25.200
But we make the rules.

21:25.880 --> 21:27.640
You'll give us 75%.

21:28.760 --> 21:29.840
I can't do that.

21:29.920 --> 21:31.320
But I'm not asking.

21:32.480 --> 21:33.840
That or nothing.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.280
-All right.
-Good girl.

21:42.360 --> 21:44.800
-Now tell me where the priest is.
-Why?

21:44.880 --> 21:49.760
You might get some funny ideas,
like selling us out to Samurai.

21:51.520 --> 21:53.840
Lele's going with you to sign the papers,

21:53.920 --> 21:56.680
me and the gypsy
are going to get the priest.

21:56.760 --> 21:58.560
Tell me where he is, come on.

22:00.640 --> 22:04.240
He's on retreat at an abbey outside Rome.

22:24.600 --> 22:25.840
What are you doing?

22:38.760 --> 22:40.680
We'll crash, stop it.

22:45.800 --> 22:47.120
Stop it.

23:10.840 --> 23:12.440
The abbey closes at nine.

23:12.880 --> 23:16.680
Six monks live there
and they all sleep on the second floor.

23:18.760 --> 23:20.320
How the fuck do you know all this stuff?

23:21.680 --> 23:23.520
You've just got to know who to ask.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.240
Fuck you, you're everywhere.

23:28.320 --> 23:29.720
You got that right.

23:31.360 --> 23:34.080
We've got some time.
Let's go, I'll show you something.

23:45.360 --> 23:48.320
-Been shopping?
-I did what you said.

23:53.680 --> 23:56.280
-What's that?
-Change from the money you gave me.

23:56.880 --> 23:59.680
No, you keep it. Maybe you can get
yourself another present.

24:04.040 --> 24:07.040
Now go and get dressed,
make yourself pretty for Spadino.

24:10.640 --> 24:11.560
Well?

24:11.640 --> 24:13.320
[in Sinti] [There's the Eur Cafe,]

24:13.400 --> 24:16.000
[that's where the Aquilara brothers deal.]

24:16.560 --> 24:18.240
[And they deal for the Adamis.]

24:18.320 --> 24:20.720
[Call Vincenzo,
get him to send two guys.]

24:22.160 --> 24:24.440
[-We do it together.]
[-When?]

24:25.320 --> 24:27.320
[Tonight, there's no reason to wait.]

24:27.400 --> 24:30.000
[Eur... I like Eur.]

24:44.120 --> 24:46.080
Fuck, what's that smell?

24:46.920 --> 24:48.680
Come on, come with me.

24:58.360 --> 24:59.480
What is this place?

25:06.240 --> 25:09.040
-Let's take a dip.
-What?

25:09.120 --> 25:12.360
In this shit?
What have you been smoking?

25:13.760 --> 25:15.120
Get undressed.

25:15.880 --> 25:16.920
No.

25:17.520 --> 25:20.520
-No way, I'm cold.
-Come on, get undressed.

25:24.440 --> 25:25.640
Are you nuts?

25:26.720 --> 25:28.600
Do what the fuck you want, then.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.760
You don't know what you're missing.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.160
You gonna stay there?

26:28.720 --> 26:30.240
You haven't worked in a while.

26:31.000 --> 26:31.960
Where've you been?

26:36.520 --> 26:39.520
Wow, you're really pissed, how come?

26:45.520 --> 26:48.000
Tell me who the asshole is,
I'll take care of him.

26:48.760 --> 26:50.880
No one makes my girls suffer.

26:54.400 --> 26:55.880
Your girls?

26:56.800 --> 26:57.800
Well, just to say.

26:59.240 --> 27:01.120
Tell me who this asshole is, come on.

27:05.360 --> 27:06.720
Whatever.

27:08.600 --> 27:10.800
Listen, I've got an important client,

27:10.880 --> 27:12.360
a guy who's rolling in cash,

27:13.120 --> 27:16.400
he's looking for someone like you,
nice and dark.

27:17.720 --> 27:19.400
This city sucks,

27:19.960 --> 27:21.320
it's a shithole.

27:32.720 --> 27:34.520
So what do you say about this client?

27:37.960 --> 27:39.560
She's a hooker,

27:40.240 --> 27:42.200
what the fuck does she want from me?

27:43.560 --> 27:45.800
-Do you like her?
-What's that got to do with it?

27:47.520 --> 27:49.760
-Do you feel good with her?
-Let it go.

27:51.520 --> 27:52.880
Feels good or not?

27:55.440 --> 27:57.040
Yeah, she makes me feel good.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.840
But she's still a hooker... and black.

28:03.720 --> 28:07.840
-I see, it's 'cause she's black.
-Okay, drop it.

28:10.200 --> 28:12.480
How about you,
how are things with the wife?

28:15.360 --> 28:16.760
All good.

28:20.200 --> 28:21.840
You don't like her, huh?

28:22.680 --> 28:23.840
What now?

28:24.800 --> 28:27.840
What the fuck you gonna do?
You're stuck with her forever.

28:27.920 --> 28:30.720
-A life sentence.
-The fuck you doing?

28:30.800 --> 28:34.120
-It's good for the skin, here.
-The fuck are you doing?

28:34.200 --> 28:35.920
Yeah, okay, whatever.

28:45.360 --> 28:47.520
Put it on my back, I can't reach.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.760
-What?
-Put it on me.

28:50.360 --> 28:53.760
Look where I've brought you!
When have you ever seen a place like this?

29:03.560 --> 29:05.920
-There, done.
-Good.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.880
-Turn around, I'll put some on you.
-No, I don't need it.

29:10.200 --> 29:12.680
It's amazing for your skin. Just look.

29:19.040 --> 29:20.840
Come on, we gotta go get the priest.

29:20.920 --> 29:23.320
Yeah, gimme a minute... and chill out.

29:43.800 --> 29:47.080
Hurry up, the notary already did us
a favor seeing us at this hour.

29:53.320 --> 29:54.360
Okay, let's do this.

30:43.520 --> 30:45.080
Which room is it?

30:45.160 --> 30:46.720
The fuck do I know?

32:12.280 --> 32:14.160
Remind you of anything?

32:16.040 --> 32:17.920
Where the fuck is he?

32:19.760 --> 32:21.360
Wanna bet he's praying?

33:58.520 --> 33:59.400
Friar Fuck!

34:00.360 --> 34:03.000
Come here, we won't hurt you.

34:03.080 --> 34:04.560
Friar Fuck!

34:24.560 --> 34:26.920
What the fuck you doing,
locking yourself in?

34:27.840 --> 34:29.159
Go away.

34:29.239 --> 34:30.520
Open the gate.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.760
Don't make me shout,
if the other little friars wake up

34:34.840 --> 34:36.880
I've got a bunch of stuff to explain.

34:36.960 --> 34:39.520
If you open the gate,
nothing happens to you, come on.

34:39.600 --> 34:41.120
Go away!

34:41.199 --> 34:43.120
Pal, Sara sent us.

34:43.199 --> 34:45.239
You got that, huh?

34:45.320 --> 34:47.679
Your friend Sara told us to come get you,

34:47.760 --> 34:50.520
so be good and open this fucking gate.

34:53.120 --> 34:54.800
I want to speak to Sara.

35:09.880 --> 35:10.960
Yes?

35:16.600 --> 35:18.080
Yes, I got it.

35:18.720 --> 35:20.240
We'll be right there.

35:26.200 --> 35:27.120
Yo, man.

35:27.200 --> 35:29.320
-How much for two?
-One hundred twenty..

35:33.640 --> 35:34.720
See ya.

35:50.240 --> 35:52.280
You got a problem?

35:52.360 --> 35:53.720
Not if you fuck off.

35:53.800 --> 35:55.680
This isn't gypsy turf.

35:59.480 --> 36:00.840
Now it is!

36:01.520 --> 36:02.560
Got that?

36:19.320 --> 36:20.760
Okay.

36:20.840 --> 36:23.560
Let's see what that bitch in Ostia
does now.

36:24.680 --> 36:26.240
We gotta be careful.

37:26.520 --> 37:27.920
Aren't you going to bed?

37:28.840 --> 37:30.680
[I don't want trouble in this house.]

37:32.160 --> 37:34.080
I don't know what you're talking about.

37:34.160 --> 37:35.720
[I think you do.]

37:40.160 --> 37:41.800
Go to bed, it's late.

37:54.400 --> 37:55.560
Everything okay?

37:59.880 --> 38:01.040
What do you want?

38:01.840 --> 38:03.240
The politician's here.

38:19.480 --> 38:21.480
-Come on!
-Wait a minute.

38:22.120 --> 38:25.200
It took me half an hour
to find the kitchen in this maze.

38:25.840 --> 38:28.520
Here, smell what you're going to eat...

38:28.600 --> 38:30.880
-I put it together with nothing.
-What is it?

38:30.960 --> 38:32.760
Garlic, oil and chili.

38:39.520 --> 38:41.880
Holy fuck, it's hot, Spadino.

38:43.720 --> 38:45.880
Priests, as we know, like it hot.

38:46.600 --> 38:49.080
Ask Isabel, she can tell you.

38:51.160 --> 38:52.280
That's them.

38:56.040 --> 38:58.200
-They're here.
-I'll go get them.

38:58.640 --> 39:00.640
And she's my woman, so watch yourself.

39:01.960 --> 39:02.960
Go.

39:07.440 --> 39:09.240
Do you know Stefano Forsini?

39:10.480 --> 39:13.160
-Why do you want to know?
-He's a member of parliament.

39:13.880 --> 39:16.920
-He was under-secretary of culture.
-Yes, I know who he is.

39:17.560 --> 39:19.640
I also know he's your ex's husband.

39:20.200 --> 39:22.200
Why do you want to know if I know him?

39:22.840 --> 39:26.920
Years ago there was talk about him
accepting bribes for wind power.

39:27.600 --> 39:29.640
He did it, but I haven't got any proof.

39:32.800 --> 39:36.160
I need Forsini to get to Taccon,
but he doesn't want to help me.

39:38.800 --> 39:41.360
You want to blackmail
an MP of the Italian Republic?

39:43.120 --> 39:46.280
-I told you, I need him to...
-Yes, I know what you need him for.

39:47.440 --> 39:48.760
Can you help me or not?

39:50.400 --> 39:52.440
You're starting to enjoy this, aren't you?

39:55.840 --> 39:58.600
I'll see if I can find something on him,
I'll call you.

40:16.720 --> 40:17.600
Where is he?

40:20.560 --> 40:21.960
Monsignor, it's me.

40:22.880 --> 40:24.120
I don't want them here,

40:25.360 --> 40:27.080
I want them outside.

40:34.160 --> 40:35.200
Go on, get out.

40:41.160 --> 40:42.440
And hurry up.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.440
They've gone.

41:17.480 --> 41:20.360
Okay, now we'll see
what your friend comes up with.

41:21.400 --> 41:24.120
She'll fix everything
and it's not the first time.

41:24.200 --> 41:28.000
We've always fixed things
on our own, so shut up.

41:28.080 --> 41:31.640
Leave him alone, Aureliano,
can't you see he's in love?

41:31.720 --> 41:34.160
Are you in love, Lele? Get married, then.

41:34.240 --> 41:37.560
We got a priest, a church, too.
Spadino can be your best man...

41:37.640 --> 41:40.000
What a fucked-up wedding
that would be!

41:40.080 --> 41:43.240
But then, she could be your mother.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.680
Don't you get sick of talking shit?

41:52.760 --> 41:54.240
What the fuck is he doing?

42:08.440 --> 42:10.440
You can go home to Greece.

42:11.760 --> 42:13.040
Give me your hand.

42:15.440 --> 42:17.800
Come on, give me your hand.

42:29.600 --> 42:31.040
No!

42:47.720 --> 42:49.760
What the fuck did he do?

43:04.560 --> 43:06.360
