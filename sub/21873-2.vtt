I brought you back here,

Yeah.

03:39.333 --> 03:42.166

up with the crew, you know?
Uh-uh.

I do not have
fuckin' partners, okay?

03:44.333 --> 03:47.208

you talking about?
You partnered with me.

of my fucking way.

Speaking of which,

03:59.375 --> 04:01.291
uh, I called ahead
and got our usual table.

04:11.291 --> 04:13.500
When do we get to meet him?
Meet him? Um, never.

04:13.500 --> 04:16.500
Ooh, sounds like Snodgrass is
getting railed by another man.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.750
Shut up, Russell.
I could use a drink
right now. I'm telling you.

04:18.750 --> 04:21.000
I got a whiff
of Russell's breath
this morning,

04:21.000 --> 04:22.500
I can still smell it.

04:22.500 --> 04:24.166
Russell:
That's Octavia LeBlanc.

Wash your mouth,
for Christ's sake.

You can smell him coming.

04:31.291 --> 04:33.000

he buys his little costumes?

04:33.000 --> 04:34.959
Those are the loudest clothes
I've ever seen.

04:34.959 --> 04:37.625
LeBlanc: Unbelievable.
Snodgrass: Oh yeah.

04:37.625 --> 04:39.417
And that cologne, my God.

04:39.417 --> 04:40.500
Smells like Raid.

Lord, it burns my eyes
every time he walks by.

04:42.583 --> 04:45.083

my eyes, man.

04:45.083 --> 04:47.000
Yes. Frosted tips?

Okay. All right. All right.

04:54.333 --> 04:58.041
Uh-- uh, I think we know now
what we didn't know from before.

04:58.041 --> 05:01.083
So, if you don't mind,
I'm just gonna...

05:01.083 --> 05:03.083
make sure that
this hard drive is...

05:03.083 --> 05:04.834
backed up.

05:26.583 --> 05:28.542

but it's got charm.

05:29.709 --> 05:30.959
Where's
the closest neighbor?

05:30.959 --> 05:32.709
Uh, about a mile
down the road.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.083
Want to take
a look inside?

05:36.083 --> 05:37.291
Yeah.

05:37.291 --> 05:40.333
Master bedroom is downstairs
and there's two more upstairs.

05:40.333 --> 05:42.417
It smells like shit.
Did somebody die in here?

05:42.417 --> 05:45.375
Uh, somebody
actually did die.

05:45.375 --> 05:47.417
What about that?
Is that mine too?

05:47.417 --> 05:48.750
The barn? Yep.

05:48.750 --> 05:50.125
Property sits on 10 acres.

05:50.125 --> 05:51.208
I'll take it.
(chuckles)

05:51.208 --> 05:53.709
I-- I-- I don't want
to jeopardize my sale,

05:53.709 --> 05:55.709
but I-- I do feel
it's my duty to at least

05:55.709 --> 05:58.208
show you
the whole place before...

05:58.208 --> 05:59.709
any decisions are made.

05:59.709 --> 06:01.750
I'll be honest
with you, Robbie Rex.

06:01.750 --> 06:05.917
Recently, someone tried
to commit first degree murder
against my body.

06:05.917 --> 06:08.083
And that killer
is still at-large.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.041
Oh dear.
"Oh dear" is right.

06:11.041 --> 06:12.834
That's why I'm looking
for a place

06:12.834 --> 06:14.917
that can be secluded,
heavily fortified.

06:14.917 --> 06:18.083
So that I can plant
intricate booby traps
around the property,

06:18.083 --> 06:20.625
turn this place into
an impenetrable fortress.

06:20.625 --> 06:21.792
'Cause let me
tell you something.

06:21.792 --> 06:23.834
My killer,
he's coming back.

06:23.834 --> 06:25.792
(furniture rattles)
And when he does,

06:25.792 --> 06:27.959
I'm gonna be fucking ready.

06:29.041 --> 06:30.792
I think you're really
gonna like the place.

06:30.792 --> 06:33.333
Yeah. Home is
where the heart is.

06:34.417 --> 06:36.333
Man, these are
some tasty-ass ribs.

06:36.333 --> 06:37.333
Good looking out, man.

06:37.333 --> 06:39.333
Thank you, man.
So you, um...

06:39.333 --> 06:40.917
Mr. Gamby's brother?

06:40.917 --> 06:43.625
(stifled laugh)
That's not funny.
Gale, we could be brothers.

06:43.625 --> 06:45.166
Ray and I share
a very deep bond.

06:45.166 --> 06:47.291
(chuckles) No,
we're not brothers though.

06:47.291 --> 06:49.959
He's married to the woman.
She used to be my wife.

06:49.959 --> 06:51.458
She bore me the girl.

06:51.458 --> 06:53.709
Dayshawn is one
of my bestest friends
at the school.

06:53.709 --> 06:55.041
In fact, he's the first one

06:55.041 --> 06:56.625
that came across
my bullet-riddled body.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.125
He actually gave chase
to the shooter.

06:58.125 --> 06:59.333
Damn.

06:59.333 --> 07:00.792
Dayshawn, the real reason
I brought you here today...

07:00.792 --> 07:02.917
well, to see if you could
help me to identify the shooter.

07:02.917 --> 07:04.166
Gale:
Oh, good Lord.

07:04.166 --> 07:06.166
Janelle, baby, why don't you
take your food, go watch TV?

07:06.166 --> 07:07.375
(whispers)
Yes!

07:07.375 --> 07:08.667
(Gale mutters indistinctly)

07:08.667 --> 07:10.375
Gamby:
Janelle, don't watch
any R-rated films.

07:10.375 --> 07:12.959
You know, I busted her
watching Revenge of the Nerds
the other day.

07:12.959 --> 07:15.208
You know,
that movie shows bush.
(binder thuds)

07:15.208 --> 07:16.875
Dayshawn, in this binder are

07:16.875 --> 07:19.291
all the individuals
who hold a grudge against me.

07:19.291 --> 07:21.834
The shooter could be
any one of these people.

07:21.834 --> 07:23.166
That's a thick-ass book.

07:23.166 --> 07:24.500
I'm surprised
there aren't more.

07:24.500 --> 07:26.500
See? This is why
I'm not married to her.

07:26.500 --> 07:27.792
Gamby:
(scoffs) Yeah.

07:27.792 --> 07:29.625
Now, Dayshawn, I want you
to look through this binder

07:29.625 --> 07:31.709
and see if any of these people
look familiar to you.

07:31.709 --> 07:33.000
Dayshawn: No.
Him?

07:33.000 --> 07:35.375
Does this seem familiar?
No. No, that's not it at all.

07:35.375 --> 07:37.625
Is this, if he was running
behind, going...
No.

07:37.625 --> 07:40.375
Does that look like
who that could have been?
No, nothing like that.

07:40.375 --> 07:42.792
Mr. Gamby, all these
black kids, man.

07:42.792 --> 07:44.709
Yeah, you said that
the shooter had black hair.

07:44.709 --> 07:47.709
Yeah, black like
the color black,
not black like Afro.

07:47.709 --> 07:50.000
Okay, you also said
the hair was greasy.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.208
It was greasy
as a motherfucker.

07:51.208 --> 07:53.041
Okay, and you also said
that the shooter was fast.

07:53.041 --> 07:54.792
So, you see, Dayshawn,
this to me all points

07:54.792 --> 07:56.709
to a Afro-American.

07:56.709 --> 07:59.583
Man, this dude had
black hair like an Indian.

07:59.583 --> 08:00.959
Like Gandhi?

08:00.959 --> 08:02.500
Gandhi ain't have no hair.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.583
(scoffs, laughs)
This is like your boy
from, uh, Smoke Signals.

08:04.583 --> 08:07.041
You ever seen Smoke Signals?
No, I've never seen that film.

08:07.041 --> 08:08.625
Can you use
a better reference?

08:08.625 --> 08:12.792
It's black like,
uh, them heavy metal
devil-worshipping motherfuckers.

08:12.792 --> 08:15.208
Devil-worshiper?
Yeah, man.

08:19.375 --> 08:20.875
Oh, shit.
There you go.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.583
Dayshawn: That's it.
Robin Shandrell.

08:25.041 --> 08:27.208
Very interesting.

08:31.750 --> 08:33.250
Hello, Octavia.

08:33.250 --> 08:34.750
Oh, this ought to be good.

08:34.750 --> 08:35.709
Good morning, Lee.

08:35.709 --> 08:37.583
Oh, well, it would
be a very good morning

08:37.583 --> 08:39.917
if we didn't have so many
gossip hounds in this school.

08:39.917 --> 08:41.625
Don't you know
that it's rude

08:41.625 --> 08:44.375
to talk about other people
behind their backs?

08:44.375 --> 08:45.917
To what is it
that you refer?

08:45.917 --> 08:48.917
I just know that
you are all mean people
who like to cut others down.

08:48.917 --> 08:50.917
Well, good luck trying
to hurt my feelings,

08:50.917 --> 08:53.875
because guess what?
You can't.

08:59.709 --> 09:02.583
I mean, yeah, if you want it.

09:02.583 --> 09:04.083
Well, I love you.

09:04.083 --> 09:06.333
(chuckles)
Bye.

09:07.333 --> 09:10.000
Was that him?
Oh, hi.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Uh, who?

09:11.000 --> 09:12.959
On the phone.
The man.

09:12.959 --> 09:14.667
What man?
Nothing.

09:14.667 --> 09:17.208
Uh, it was my mom.
Oh, 'cause I was gonna say,

09:17.208 --> 09:19.333
that's a little soon
to be saying that to him.

09:19.333 --> 09:21.041
Saying what?

09:21.041 --> 09:22.125
"I love you."

09:22.959 --> 09:24.417
I mean, I'm not saying that.
No.

09:24.417 --> 09:25.959
I'm saying if you were
saying it to him,
Yeah, no--

09:25.959 --> 09:27.792
if it had been him,
then that would have
been too soon.

09:27.792 --> 09:30.500
I'm just saying it to,
um, to my mom.

09:30.500 --> 09:33.041
Yeah, well, you've known
your mom for a long time,
so it's natural.

09:33.041 --> 09:34.709
Who-- who's that?
What you doin'?

09:34.709 --> 09:36.959
Anything fun?

09:36.959 --> 09:38.542
It's Robin Shandrell.

09:38.542 --> 09:41.875
He's the number one suspect
in my shooting case.
Oh, my God.

09:41.875 --> 09:43.458
Is that a whole binder
of suspects?

09:43.458 --> 09:44.625
Oh, my God,
yes, it is.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.375
Be very glad
I don't put Brian in here.

09:46.375 --> 09:48.250
Excuse me?
You heard me.

09:48.250 --> 09:50.583
Why don't you just keep
your nose clean, Snodgrass?

09:50.583 --> 09:51.834
What?

09:52.875 --> 09:54.250
Swift, wake your ass up.

09:54.250 --> 09:56.083
I'm leaving campus
to go run an errand.

09:56.083 --> 09:57.667
If anybody asks,
just tell 'em that

09:57.667 --> 09:59.041
because it's true.
Okay.

09:59.041 --> 10:00.291
Mind if I come with?

10:00.291 --> 10:02.542
Actually, Nash, this is more
of a solo mission.

10:02.542 --> 10:05.000
Yeah, but Russell said

10:05.000 --> 10:07.208
ya supposed to
show me the ropes.

10:07.208 --> 10:09.125
Well, I'm not sure
you can handle these ropes.

10:09.125 --> 10:10.333
Try me.

10:10.333 --> 10:12.500
Fine, I will.

10:12.500 --> 10:13.834
I'll try you by fire.

10:13.834 --> 10:15.000
Let's go, rookie.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.959
Let's see what kind
of man you are.

10:18.667 --> 10:21.375
Now, Nash, sometimes,
you're gonna have to
leave school grounds,

10:21.375 --> 10:23.166
even during school hours
if it means

10:23.166 --> 10:24.792
interrogating a potential
murder suspect.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.500
Suspect, huh?

10:26.500 --> 10:28.500
Who's the perp?
Robin Shandrell.

10:28.500 --> 10:31.083
He's a kid who used to go
to North Jackson High.

10:31.083 --> 10:33.375
Found the ultimate payload
of all his reefers.

10:33.375 --> 10:35.542
Busted his ass
and had him expelled.

10:35.542 --> 10:37.667
Now he's working here
at this slaughterhouse,

10:37.667 --> 10:39.041
killing fucking pigs.

10:39.041 --> 10:42.000
My theory? He's been plotting
his revenge for the last year,

10:42.000 --> 10:43.875
waiting for the perfect
opportunity to strike.

10:43.875 --> 10:46.875
What do you see?
Okay, let's see.

10:46.875 --> 10:49.625
A couple of big,
fat white guys--
No, he's not overweight.

10:49.625 --> 10:51.417
He's not overweight.
Okay, let's see.

10:51.417 --> 10:54.000
I got a Hispanic
with a little goatee,

10:54.000 --> 10:56.333
big, fat white guy--
Doesn't matter
what their hair's like, Nash.

10:56.333 --> 10:58.041
He's not Mexican, okay?
All right. Oh...

10:58.041 --> 11:02.125
Ooh, ooh, freaky,
spiky-haired kid
coming out now.

11:02.125 --> 11:04.000
Really pasty white.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.208
That's him.
That's Robin Shandrell.

11:06.208 --> 11:07.792
Of course he cut
his hair, huh?

11:07.792 --> 11:09.125
He doesn't want
to be noticed.

11:09.125 --> 11:10.667
He's hiding.

11:10.667 --> 11:13.250
All the fucking
makeovers in the world
won't hide his filthy soul.

11:13.250 --> 11:16.375
Filthy, filthy fucking soul.

11:34.750 --> 11:37.000
Nash:
Feel kind of weird
going to his house.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.125
It's not weird, Nash.

11:38.125 --> 11:39.583
Just keep an eye out.
What's he doing?

11:39.583 --> 11:40.875
Aw, jeez!

11:40.875 --> 11:43.083
No, he's walking over here!
He's what?

11:43.083 --> 11:44.542
Shit, Nash!

11:44.542 --> 11:47.208
Get out of
the fucking car, Gamby.

11:47.208 --> 11:48.917
Settle down.

11:52.125 --> 11:53.458
Robin Shandrell.

11:53.458 --> 11:55.542
Me and my associate here were
just doing some fly-bys.

11:55.542 --> 11:57.709
We-- we were
looking for truants.
I didn't know you lived here.

11:57.709 --> 12:00.041
You're spying on me.
I saw you at my work.

12:00.041 --> 12:01.458
Maybe I fucking was, huh?

12:01.458 --> 12:03.375
I'm on to you,
you freak piece of shit.

12:03.375 --> 12:04.625
I know you're the one
who shot me.

12:04.625 --> 12:06.083
I heard about that.

12:06.083 --> 12:09.250
Yeah, but I'm really fucking
glad that it happened.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.834
You know why?
Do you know why
I'm fucking glad

12:11.834 --> 12:13.208
that it happened, Gamby?

12:13.208 --> 12:16.959
I'm fucking happy because
you're a piece of fucking shit!

12:16.959 --> 12:19.792
Watch it, punk.
Shut the fuck up!

12:19.792 --> 12:22.458
You watch it!
You want to get your
melon knocked off?

12:22.458 --> 12:23.834
I'll knock your
fucking melon off!

12:23.834 --> 12:26.041
Get back here,
Shandrell. Confess.

12:26.041 --> 12:28.458
Confess into my
voice-mail application now!

12:28.458 --> 12:32.500
Why don't you fucking frame me
like the last time, Gamby?

12:32.500 --> 12:34.500
What the hell are you
talking about, Shandrell?

12:34.500 --> 12:36.500
You got caught
selling drugs at school

12:36.500 --> 12:38.250
and you got busted.
Case closed.

12:38.250 --> 12:39.917
I never kept my shit
in my locker.

12:39.917 --> 12:41.750
I'm not that fucking stupid.

12:41.750 --> 12:43.917
How'd it get there?
How the hell
am I supposed to know?

12:43.917 --> 12:45.208
'Cause you planted it.

12:45.208 --> 12:47.417
You framed me.
That's what you did.

12:47.417 --> 12:49.166
Nash, get him.
Go, go, go!

12:49.166 --> 12:50.375
Hey!
Get back here!

12:51.333 --> 12:52.834
Aah!
Oh, shit!

12:52.834 --> 12:53.750
Fuck.

12:53.750 --> 12:55.709
How dare you,
Shandrell!
Oh, God.

12:55.709 --> 12:57.417
You haven't heard
the last from us!

12:57.417 --> 12:58.875
Oh... God.
Nash, come to me.

12:58.875 --> 13:00.500
I appreciate
your follow-through there.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.625
That was good.
You followed directions,
but you need to be quicker.

13:02.625 --> 13:04.583
That's not fast enough.
Thanks.

13:04.583 --> 13:08.458
(Russell groans)

13:08.458 --> 13:10.458
(groaning)

13:10.458 --> 13:12.166
Hey.

13:12.166 --> 13:14.208
Tell me
what's going on, Lee.

13:16.166 --> 13:19.792
I used to be friends
with all the teachers...

13:19.792 --> 13:23.000
then I became principal
and they all started
complainin',

13:23.000 --> 13:25.709
whinin' and talkin' shit.

13:25.709 --> 13:27.208
You're the leader
of the school.

13:27.208 --> 13:29.625
You have a different
relationship with them now.

13:29.625 --> 13:31.959
I'm sure you'll
find the balance.

13:31.959 --> 13:34.250
Not with Ms. LeBlanc
leading the wolfpack.

13:34.250 --> 13:36.333
Talkin' about my fuckin'--
my breath.

13:36.333 --> 13:37.875
Your breath?

13:37.875 --> 13:39.250
I wanna kill her so bad.

13:39.250 --> 13:40.750
I wanna do like the Muslims

13:40.750 --> 13:42.750
and chop her fuckin'
head off, Christine,

13:42.750 --> 13:44.166
and make a video
out of it.

13:44.166 --> 13:45.709
Okay, well,
I know you, Lee,

13:45.709 --> 13:48.875
and when you get upset,
you fly off the handle.

13:48.875 --> 13:50.834
You might
just make it worse.

13:50.834 --> 13:52.875
You catch more flies
with honey.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.625
Excuse me?

13:54.625 --> 13:56.667
The teachers are the ones
being assholes.

13:56.667 --> 13:59.083
They're the ones who
need to use some honey.

13:59.083 --> 14:00.500
You dusty old queef.

14:00.500 --> 14:02.291
Oh, Christine, I'm sorry.

14:02.291 --> 14:03.542
You set me up.
I had to.

14:03.542 --> 14:06.250
Christine, please don't--
Christine?

14:06.250 --> 14:08.917
Nobody gets my sense of humor.

14:10.667 --> 14:13.834
Maybe the best way
to win their loyalty

14:13.834 --> 14:15.166
is to be nice.

14:15.166 --> 14:17.875
If you give them
nothing to complain about,

14:17.875 --> 14:19.792
they have
no power against you.

14:20.750 --> 14:23.667
Kindness is power.

14:23.667 --> 14:25.375
That is beautiful.

14:26.291 --> 14:27.750
Gamby:
Yeah.

14:29.792 --> 14:32.083
Mm. Fuck yeah.

14:59.792 --> 15:04.959
(tapping continuing)

15:11.959 --> 15:12.959
Ugh.

15:12.959 --> 15:14.625
(sniffing)
You smell that?

15:15.917 --> 15:17.000
(door opens)

15:18.250 --> 15:20.834
Surprise, surprise!

15:20.834 --> 15:22.750
It is...

15:22.750 --> 15:26.166
sushi time
in the teachers' lounge!

15:26.166 --> 15:28.333
Uh, this is,
uh, Yuki San.

15:28.333 --> 15:30.166
Hey.
Arigato.
He says arigato.  "Hi."

15:30.166 --> 15:33.959
Uh, he works next
to the fish counter
at Albertson's,

15:33.959 --> 15:35.667
but I was able to
wrangle him for the day.

15:35.667 --> 15:39.333
We have, uh--
uh, spicy tuna, unagi,

15:39.333 --> 15:42.166
salmon roll,
and shrimp tempura.

15:42.166 --> 15:44.500
Oh, and, uh, and Bruce,
he's even doing

15:44.500 --> 15:45.834
a little cream cheese
thing for you

15:45.834 --> 15:48.458
because you, well, you seem
like you might like those.

15:48.458 --> 15:51.041
It-- it looks left over
from another function.

15:51.041 --> 15:52.750
Is it fresh?
Oh, it is so fresh.

15:52.750 --> 15:54.041
It is caught daily.

15:54.041 --> 15:56.667
And I paid for it,
so I know that it's fresh.

15:56.667 --> 15:58.291
I know how much it costs.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.667
Well, come on, y'all.
What's the hold up?

16:01.667 --> 16:03.834
Yuki is gonna
get his feelings hurt.

16:03.834 --> 16:06.333
I think we're just
not in the mood for sushi.

16:07.375 --> 16:08.500
Not in the mood?

16:08.500 --> 16:09.875
Oh, come on, y'all.

16:09.875 --> 16:12.625
Look, I'm just trying to be
good ol' Cool Hand Lee here

16:12.625 --> 16:14.375
to let y'all know
that nothing's changed.

16:14.375 --> 16:17.208
Look, my new mission
is to be the coolest

16:17.208 --> 16:18.959
goddamn boss
in the whole world.

16:18.959 --> 16:20.542
(laughing)

16:20.542 --> 16:22.583
Ross:
She is laughing.

16:22.583 --> 16:24.250
She is... she's laughing.

16:24.250 --> 16:27.083
Was that a...
a joke, Ms. LeBlanc?

16:27.083 --> 16:30.041
"Boss"? That's how
you see yourself?

16:30.041 --> 16:31.709
Well, I'm the principal,

16:31.709 --> 16:34.875
so I am technically
the boss of everyone.

16:34.875 --> 16:38.041
Not me.
I work for the district.
Uh, no, you work for me.

16:38.041 --> 16:39.709
No, actually,
for the district.

16:39.709 --> 16:42.375
Look, this is childish,
and I'm not gonna get
into an argument with you.

16:42.375 --> 16:44.709
I don't have to prove
to anyone here

16:44.709 --> 16:46.250
the position
of the principal

16:46.250 --> 16:47.875
and where he is on the--
on the top of the heap.

16:47.875 --> 16:49.500
If you were--
You wouldn't even
be the principal

16:49.500 --> 16:52.125
if two other people
hadn't crapped out on us.

16:52.125 --> 16:53.917
You are not
the king of the heap.

16:53.917 --> 16:56.917
You are
the last man standing.

16:59.041 --> 17:00.417
Meow.

17:00.417 --> 17:02.250
Okay, y'all.
Well, I get it.

17:02.250 --> 17:04.083
I guess I'll just leave,

17:04.083 --> 17:07.375
so that you can talk
about my hair

17:07.375 --> 17:09.083
or my breath

17:09.083 --> 17:12.083
or how stupid
I look in my clothes.

17:12.083 --> 17:14.917
I'll just leave this sushi
for... all of you here.

17:14.917 --> 17:17.667
I'll just put it
in a place where...
where you can...

17:17.667 --> 17:19.208
get it to...
What are you doing?

17:19.208 --> 17:20.542
Ross:
Lee! Lee!

17:20.542 --> 17:23.333
Here, here's this. Let's not
forget the cream cheese.

17:23.333 --> 17:25.959
Jesus Christ!
And oh, my word,
why not have some

17:25.959 --> 17:28.667
sauce with this
and have some...

17:28.667 --> 17:31.125
Stop!
(teachers gasping)

17:31.125 --> 17:35.166
You can take my attempt
at a loving gesture

17:35.166 --> 17:37.834
and eat it off
the fucking floor.

17:47.750 --> 17:49.625
Big Willows,
grab your Uzi.

17:49.625 --> 17:51.458
We're gonna go bust
the a-hole that shot me.

17:51.458 --> 17:53.959
I already told you, Gamby.
No more leads.

17:53.959 --> 17:56.333
I have a real suspect now.
His name is Robin Shandrell,

17:56.333 --> 17:58.750
and he basically
already confessed
to the attempted murder.

17:58.750 --> 18:00.333
Well, if that's so,
I would need a warrant

18:00.333 --> 18:02.250
to do a home search,
and I don't have one.

18:02.250 --> 18:03.792
Goddammit, Willows.
You pencil-pusher.

18:03.792 --> 18:07.000
Are you saying I gotta
take care of this on my own?

18:07.000 --> 18:08.375
No, I'm not saying
that at all.

18:08.375 --> 18:10.333
What I'm saying is
do nothing.

18:10.333 --> 18:12.208
You go over there trying
to bust that kid yourself,

18:12.208 --> 18:14.500
you'd be breaking
all kinds of laws.

18:14.500 --> 18:15.625
Do you understand?

18:15.625 --> 18:17.875
Can I borrow your sidearm
and your sunglasses?

18:17.875 --> 18:19.125
Hell no.

18:19.125 --> 18:22.375
I guess now I know
what "Willows" stands for.

18:22.375 --> 18:24.208
"Pussy Willows."

18:26.166 --> 18:28.041
Goddammit, Gamby.

18:29.542 --> 18:32.125
Russell, I need to split
out of here early.

18:32.125 --> 18:33.792
Is that okay with you?

18:33.792 --> 18:35.041
You okay?

18:35.041 --> 18:37.542
I'm all alone, Gamby.

18:37.542 --> 18:40.000
The teachers hate me now.
(sighs)

18:40.000 --> 18:41.875
You are my one true ally.

18:41.875 --> 18:43.375
Come on, man.

18:43.375 --> 18:44.709
Who cares if
the teachers don't like you?

18:44.709 --> 18:47.333
They've never liked me.
I don't give a shit.

18:47.333 --> 18:50.000
What are you doing
with Mr. King's bolt cutters?

18:51.542 --> 18:53.417
You're gonna do something
fucked up, aren't you?

18:53.417 --> 18:55.875
No, it's just part
of my investigation.

18:55.875 --> 18:58.583
Invent...You're doing
investigation stuff without me?

18:58.583 --> 19:01.166
I told you that I would help you
with that, Gamby.
I know, Russell,

19:01.166 --> 19:03.291
but you're the principal.
I'm just trying to keep
you out of it

19:03.291 --> 19:05.709
since I'm doing
off-the-record type stuff.
Please. Fuck that.

19:05.709 --> 19:08.375
I wanna get my hands dirty,
like last semester.

19:08.375 --> 19:10.375
I don't know, Russell.
This could get a little...

19:10.375 --> 19:12.542
That's what I'm countin' on.

19:22.250 --> 19:25.667
Okay, I'm gonna go
through the side window
and penetrate that.

19:25.667 --> 19:27.542
I need you to go to the front
and create a diversion.

19:27.542 --> 19:30.500
A diver-- Uh, no!
What? I'm not ready for that.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.250
What am I supposed to do?
Come on, Russell.

19:32.250 --> 19:34.458
You're the principal, man.
Command the situation.

19:36.667 --> 19:37.709
Yeah...

19:37.709 --> 19:40.375
I am the fucking principal.

19:46.583 --> 19:47.750
Uh...

19:56.417 --> 19:59.000
(guitar strumming)

19:59.000 --> 20:00.625
(knocking on door)

20:02.125 --> 20:03.917
Um... um...

20:03.917 --> 20:06.625
Hello, my name
is Lee Russell,

20:06.625 --> 20:09.542
the principal
of North Jackson High School.

20:09.542 --> 20:12.125
I understand that
your son was in an altercation

20:12.125 --> 20:13.875
with a female
school official yesterday

20:13.875 --> 20:16.583
and I would like
to question him, please.

20:16.583 --> 20:19.417
Robin!
Somebody to see you.

20:19.417 --> 20:20.917
(door squeaks)

20:24.291 --> 20:26.917
Russell:
Hello, Robin.
Do you remember me?

20:26.917 --> 20:28.458
Lee Russell?

20:29.959 --> 20:31.208
I'm principal now.

20:31.208 --> 20:33.667
Robin:
Yeah, I don't give
a shit what you are.

20:33.667 --> 20:36.709
Well, you should.
You hit my VP.

20:36.709 --> 20:39.458
And hittin' ladies
does not fly at my school.

20:39.458 --> 20:41.959
Mother:
You hit a woman, Robin?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

20:41.959 --> 20:43.709
Are you a fucking idiot?
Uh, hey.

20:43.709 --> 20:45.458
Robin. Now, Robin, you can
either deal with me

20:45.458 --> 20:47.959
right here, right now,
or Ms. Nash may have
to press charges.

20:47.959 --> 20:50.625
Mother:
I wish you would arrest him.
No-good son of a bitch.

20:50.625 --> 20:52.333
Robin:
I didn't do
anything fucking wrong.

20:52.333 --> 20:54.125
They're the ones
who were spying on me.

20:54.125 --> 20:57.750
I'm not gonna
fucking apologize
to your vice principal's shit.

20:57.750 --> 20:59.333
I didn't--
I didn't do anything wrong.

20:59.333 --> 21:02.792
I'm not saying that
you did anything--
Yes, you are! That's--

21:02.792 --> 21:05.667
(coughing)

21:05.667 --> 21:06.834
Robin, hey.
(snaps fingers)

21:06.834 --> 21:08.709
All you gotta do
is talk to me.
(coughing)

21:08.709 --> 21:09.750
I don't wanna talk to you.

21:09.750 --> 21:11.959
And get the fuck out
of my house.

21:11.959 --> 21:13.667
Uh, excuse me.

21:13.667 --> 21:16.000
I am the principal
of North Jackson High School

21:16.000 --> 21:17.709
and I need to-- you need
to come right back here

21:17.709 --> 21:19.542
is what you need to do.

21:19.542 --> 21:22.458
What's the matter, Paw-Paw?
(groans)

21:22.458 --> 21:23.834
Did you doo-doo?
No.

21:23.834 --> 21:25.542
Did you poo, Paw-Paw?
Mm.

21:26.667 --> 21:30.375
All right, Paw-Paw,
let's get a bath, okay?

21:31.500 --> 21:33.709
Look at me, Paw-Paw.
(grunts)

21:33.709 --> 21:35.500
It's me. It's Robin.

21:35.500 --> 21:36.709
I'll always be here.

21:36.709 --> 21:38.875
I'll always take care of you.
Mm.

21:43.500 --> 21:44.875
Come on, Paw-Paw.

21:58.542 --> 22:00.417
(sighs)

22:00.417 --> 22:02.458
Oh, holy shit.

22:02.458 --> 22:06.375
Oh, it feels so good to be back
on the ol' wrecking crew.

22:06.375 --> 22:07.542
(chuckles)

22:07.542 --> 22:08.750
Oh, that kid,

22:08.750 --> 22:10.041
he's definitely your shooter.

22:10.041 --> 22:12.667
Did you see how poor
his family was?

22:12.667 --> 22:14.709
Poor people always
commit crimes.

22:14.709 --> 22:16.083
It's in their DNA.

22:16.083 --> 22:18.000
Russell, there's something
I need to get off my chest.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.166
You know when
I busted Shandrell

22:20.166 --> 22:22.000
last school year?
Mm-hmm.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
I may have put my thumb
on the scales of justice a bit.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.750
The marijuana that was found
in his locker...

22:28.750 --> 22:29.875
I planted it.

22:29.875 --> 22:31.000
Whoa.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.083
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I know, I know.

22:35.417 --> 22:37.083
You framed a child?

22:37.083 --> 22:38.500
I just didn't see
any other way, you know?

22:38.500 --> 22:40.667
He's-- he's sitting there
dealing drugs at school

22:40.667 --> 22:41.959
and all the students
know that he is.

22:41.959 --> 22:43.750
You know, and what kind
of leader does that make me

22:43.750 --> 22:45.625
if I just let it happen
right under my fucking nose?

22:45.625 --> 22:47.333
I had to send a message
to the student body.

22:47.333 --> 22:49.333
You break the law,
I fuck you raw.

22:49.333 --> 22:50.875
That's a Gamby promise.

22:50.875 --> 22:52.250
Well, it takes somebody

22:52.250 --> 22:56.250
mighty dirty
to do something

22:56.250 --> 22:57.875
that is that beautiful.

22:57.875 --> 23:00.291
That's what
I'm talkin' about.

23:00.291 --> 23:01.959
No nonsense.

23:01.959 --> 23:03.625
So you think that that's cool?
Cool?

23:03.625 --> 23:05.959
I think that's super fresh.

23:05.959 --> 23:08.375
I don't know.
I'm just kind of...
struggling with it.

23:08.375 --> 23:10.333
I feel like I ruined
this kid's life...
"Struggling"?

23:10.333 --> 23:13.000
and I'm just trying to figure
out if it was the right thing.
"Struggling"?

23:13.000 --> 23:15.291
Did I go too far?
"Too far"?

23:15.291 --> 23:16.625
You're an inspiration.

23:16.625 --> 23:18.583
I know what it is
that I have to do now.

23:18.583 --> 23:22.291
All those fuckin' teachers
who talk shit about me,

23:22.291 --> 23:25.125
LeBlanc, Carter,
Kingsbury, Ross and Snodgrass,

23:25.125 --> 23:27.583
they all about
to get fucked raw
is what's going to happen.

23:27.583 --> 23:30.625
I need to send a message
the Neal Gamby way.

23:30.625 --> 23:33.250
Well, maybe
don't fuck Snodgrass raw.

23:33.250 --> 23:34.417
I mean--
Why?

23:34.417 --> 23:35.750
She doesn't even like you.

23:35.750 --> 23:37.959
She's probably
getting 69'd right now.
Don't say that.

23:37.959 --> 23:40.709
She probably is. She's probably
getting held up just like
this right now.

23:40.709 --> 23:42.000
No, that's gross. Russell.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.875
Okay.

23:43.875 --> 23:46.709
I'll spare Snodgrass.

23:48.542 --> 23:49.709
(sighs)

23:49.709 --> 23:51.291
The Gamby way.

23:51.291 --> 23:54.250
(school bell chimes)

23:54.250 --> 23:56.000
Nash:
Ms. LeBlanc?

23:56.000 --> 23:58.542
Principal Russell
wants to see ya.

23:58.542 --> 24:00.500
(banging on window)

24:00.500 --> 24:02.125
Pronto!

24:12.750 --> 24:15.000
Russell, they're all here.
Hello, everyone.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.625
Thank you all
for coming out here
and joining me.

24:21.625 --> 24:23.875
This is a very special
place for me,

24:23.875 --> 24:27.417
a place that I like
to come to and think.

24:27.417 --> 24:32.542
Now, I've brought you here
because you all need a lesson

24:32.542 --> 24:35.125
in respecting your superiors.

24:35.125 --> 24:36.417
You can't be serious.

24:36.417 --> 24:37.917
Oh, I'm serious, Bruce.

24:37.917 --> 24:39.625
I'm as serious
as the heart attack

24:39.625 --> 24:41.208
that you had last year.

24:41.208 --> 24:42.709
Oh, for the love
of God, Russell.

24:42.709 --> 24:44.458
Is this about
not wanting to eat sushi?

24:44.458 --> 24:46.667
No, Ms. LeBlanc.

24:46.667 --> 24:51.083
This is way bigger
than eating sushi.

24:53.417 --> 24:56.458
This is about me...

24:56.458 --> 24:59.041
firing all of you.

24:59.041 --> 25:00.583
(scoffs)
What?

25:00.583 --> 25:03.750
Now, I've had Mr. Gamby
gather your personal effects.

25:03.750 --> 25:07.250
If I see you again
on this campus,

25:07.250 --> 25:08.500
you will be shot on sight.

25:08.500 --> 25:09.917
Carter: Whoa, whoa, Lee.
(teachers mutter)

25:09.917 --> 25:12.083
Kingsbury:
This is cruel! Vindictive!

25:12.083 --> 25:13.375
Oh, please.

25:13.375 --> 25:16.208
Ruth Ann, if I was being
cruel and vindictive,
I'd talk about

25:16.208 --> 25:18.458
you smelling up
the teachers' lounge
every day with your poop.

25:18.458 --> 25:21.750
1:30 every day,
in there straight
fucking killing it.

25:21.750 --> 25:23.792
Smells like goats at the fair.

25:28.667 --> 25:30.875
IDs in the bucket. Come on.
Kingsbury: Oh, come on.

25:30.875 --> 25:32.959
Yeah. Come. You. Right here.
No. Uh-uh.

25:32.959 --> 25:34.291
Uh-huh.
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

25:34.291 --> 25:36.375
Teachers: Relax! Jeez!
Gamby: Bruce, just do it.

25:36.375 --> 25:38.000
Let's go. All of 'em.
Jeez!

25:38.000 --> 25:39.250
Come on.
Throw it in, Bruce.

25:39.250 --> 25:42.625
Throw it in.
Do it, Bruce.

25:50.166 --> 25:51.125
Oh, this is smart.

25:51.125 --> 25:52.959
This is very,
very intelligent, Lee.

25:52.959 --> 25:54.291
Oh, that's brilliant.

25:54.291 --> 25:55.667
Yeah.

26:00.542 --> 26:01.667
Jeez! Whoa!

26:02.875 --> 26:06.083
To quote Euripides:
"When one with honeyed words--"

26:06.083 --> 26:07.208
Ms. LeBlanc,

26:07.208 --> 26:08.792
why don't you take
your Euripides

26:08.792 --> 26:11.500
and shove it up your ass

26:11.500 --> 26:13.500
before I have
Gamby frog-walk you

26:13.500 --> 26:15.417
the fuck out of this forest?

26:15.417 --> 26:16.792
Get the fuck out of here!

26:18.291 --> 26:19.959
Go.

26:19.959 --> 26:21.583
Kingsbury: Lee--
Go, go.

26:21.583 --> 26:22.667
Go, you bunch of has-beens.

26:22.667 --> 26:23.917
This is my life's work!

26:23.917 --> 26:25.834
I'm too old
to start a new school!

26:25.834 --> 26:27.417
Ruth Ann, stop
embarrassing yourself.

26:27.417 --> 26:30.000
Go. You'll get
a job... somewhere.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.417
Well, if it isn't Bill Hayden.

26:32.417 --> 26:33.834
I'm so happy
you could come join us.

26:33.834 --> 26:35.583
You're hurting me!
Gamby...

26:35.583 --> 26:36.834
why don't you do the honors?

26:36.834 --> 26:38.250
Have yourself a thrill kill.

26:38.250 --> 26:40.333
Oh, I don't have anything
against Bill Hayden anymore.

26:40.333 --> 26:41.750
I'm not pursuing Snodgrass.
Oh, come on.

26:41.750 --> 26:43.333
Get a little blood
in your mouth.

26:43.333 --> 26:44.667
Remember how good it tastes.

26:46.750 --> 26:48.125
You know what to ask.

26:49.041 --> 26:50.583
Hand me your fuckin' ID, Bill.

26:50.583 --> 26:52.959
(chuckles)
You know what?

26:52.959 --> 26:54.041
I don't even care.

26:54.041 --> 26:56.041
This school's gone
to shit anyway, Gamby.

26:56.041 --> 26:57.458
So, fuck you.

26:57.458 --> 26:58.542
And fuck you.

26:58.542 --> 27:01.458
(whistles)
Fuck you! Fuck you!
No, fuck you.

27:01.458 --> 27:03.125
Russell:
Oh!

27:03.125 --> 27:04.834
Whoo!

27:04.834 --> 27:06.500
Oh!

27:07.625 --> 27:10.333
That was good.
I'm back. I'm back.

27:10.333 --> 27:12.709
I'm back! Oh, my God!

27:12.709 --> 27:14.125
Oh!

27:14.125 --> 27:16.333
Ice-cold killer, Gamby!

27:16.333 --> 27:17.792
Fucking brutal!

27:17.792 --> 27:19.333
Just like you, Gamby!

27:19.333 --> 27:21.125
Just like you!

27:21.125 --> 27:22.917
(laughs)

27:22.917 --> 27:24.583
Just like you!

27:24.583 --> 27:26.208
Thank you, my friend!

27:26.208 --> 27:27.667
Whoo!

27:33.834 --> 27:35.375
(machine whirring)

27:40.542 --> 27:41.709
What are you doing here?

27:41.709 --> 27:43.959
This is no life
for a boy your age.

27:43.959 --> 27:46.875
You don't give a fuck.
You don't care.

27:46.875 --> 27:48.208
No, that's not true.

27:48.208 --> 27:49.875
I very much do give a fuck.

27:49.875 --> 27:51.583
You and I both know

27:51.583 --> 27:53.417
that what I did
to you wasn't right.

27:53.417 --> 27:55.083
I want to change that.
Why?

27:55.083 --> 27:56.959
You think just because
you say sorry

27:56.959 --> 27:58.959
that everything's okay?
'Cause it's not.

27:58.959 --> 28:00.750
You still did what you did.

28:00.750 --> 28:03.250
I know. I don't think it will
make everything okay, but...

28:03.250 --> 28:04.542
hopefully this could...

28:04.542 --> 28:07.542
be a step
in the right direction.

28:11.417 --> 28:13.875
Re-admission papers
to North Jackson High.

28:13.875 --> 28:15.750
You can return to school
if you want to.

28:15.750 --> 28:18.750
If you come back,
you can't fuck around.

28:18.750 --> 28:21.250
You can't sell drugs,
you can't act like an asshole.

28:21.250 --> 28:22.750
You gotta fall in line.

28:22.750 --> 28:24.417
Can you do that?

28:24.417 --> 28:25.458
Yeah.

28:26.583 --> 28:28.625
See you at school.

28:34.333 --> 28:36.041
Dayshawn, my man.

28:36.041 --> 28:37.500
What's up, Mr. Gamby?

28:37.500 --> 28:40.125
I wanted to apologize to you
for the rib dinner.
It wasn't enough.

28:40.125 --> 28:43.000
Oh, no, man.
I thought them ribs
was tasty as fuck.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.083
Thank you, man.

28:44.083 --> 28:46.083
No, don't thank me.
I'm trying to thank you.

28:46.083 --> 28:47.500
I got something for you.

28:47.500 --> 28:49.959
Something I feel
is more appropriate
for you saving my life.

28:49.959 --> 28:51.333
Wow, man. That's, uh...

28:51.333 --> 28:53.458
Yup. Oh, shit!
Look at that!

28:53.458 --> 28:55.500
Looks like we both
in this motherfucker for real.

28:55.500 --> 28:58.709
Immortalized.
Two heroes, you and I.
So, what do you say?

28:58.709 --> 29:00.792
Are we even
for you saving my life?

29:00.792 --> 29:02.125
Uh, sure, dude.

29:02.125 --> 29:03.458
Life debt repaid.

29:03.458 --> 29:04.792
I'm cool with it
if you are.

29:04.792 --> 29:07.542
(engine revving)

29:07.542 --> 29:09.542
Who the fuck is that?
I don't know,

29:09.542 --> 29:10.875
but that's a nice-ass car.

29:10.875 --> 29:12.750
You're not supposed
to pick up people here.

29:12.750 --> 29:14.166
This is strictly for buses.

29:14.166 --> 29:16.500
Snodgrass:
Hi! Perfect timing!

29:17.667 --> 29:19.166
