WEBVTT

00:04.872 --> 00:06.807
Previously on ER:

00:06.840 --> 00:08.376
( groans )

00:08.409 --> 00:10.378
Sam Taggart. New Nurse.

00:10.411 --> 00:12.646
I started my surgical
rotation today.

00:12.680 --> 00:13.747
I'm back in med school.

00:13.781 --> 00:15.083
So, no more nursing?

00:15.116 --> 00:16.584
No, I'm still going
to be taking

00:16.617 --> 00:19.087
a few shifts for a while.
I need the money.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.088
What are you
nut-meats doing?

00:20.121 --> 00:21.789
Clearing Triage.

00:21.822 --> 00:25.459
We'll provide good care,
and we're going to do it faster.

00:25.493 --> 00:27.261
You're going to form
a line down the hall,

00:27.295 --> 00:29.663
and you'll be examined
three at a time.

00:29.697 --> 00:32.333
It's your new hospital?
Yep.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.235
It's even crappier
than the last one.

00:34.268 --> 00:36.570
I'm a 71-year-old man
who's going blind.

00:36.604 --> 00:38.572
I've considered everything.

00:38.606 --> 00:39.540
Promise me you're not going
to kill yourself

00:39.573 --> 00:40.574
in the next
72 hours.

00:40.608 --> 00:43.744
But, but Monday would be okay?

00:43.777 --> 00:45.613
I'm off the hook by then.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.784
LEWIS:
"The friend had,
in a weak hour,

00:50.818 --> 00:53.754
"spoken with sobs
of his own death.

00:53.787 --> 00:56.324
"He had delivered
a melancholy oration

00:56.357 --> 00:57.825
"previous to his funeral,

00:57.858 --> 01:00.294
"and had doubtless
in the packet of letters,

01:00.328 --> 01:03.764
"presented various
keepsakes to relatives.

01:03.797 --> 01:06.134
"But he had not died,

01:06.134 --> 01:07.801
"and thus he had
delivered himself

01:07.835 --> 01:10.371
into the hands of the youth."

01:10.404 --> 01:11.272
( grinding )

01:12.806 --> 01:14.408
Oh, sorry.

01:14.442 --> 01:16.377
Are you taking your enalapril?

01:17.178 --> 01:18.446
Uh, yeah.

01:18.479 --> 01:19.613
Do you want me
to bump up your Lasix?

01:19.647 --> 01:21.782
Coffee does the same thing.

01:21.815 --> 01:25.186
It also raises
your blood pressure.

01:25.219 --> 01:29.523
Well, as luck would have it,
you gave me a pill for that too.

01:31.225 --> 01:33.327
You want...
you want more espresso?

01:33.361 --> 01:35.529
Not unless
I'm going to fly to work.

01:37.898 --> 01:41.369
"The latter felt immensely
superior to his friend,

01:41.402 --> 01:45.239
but he inclined
toward condescension."

01:45.273 --> 01:47.875
You don't... you don't have
to keep doing this.

01:47.908 --> 01:49.610
Well, I've got time
to finish the chapter.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.379
I've never read this before.
It's good.

01:51.412 --> 01:55.583
You, you don't have to keep...
keep coming here.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.751
I don't have this book.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.787
Keep it. I'm...

01:59.820 --> 02:01.622
I'm never going to read it
again.

02:01.655 --> 02:04.492
That's why I'm here.
That and the coffee.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.728
He died at 29.

02:09.930 --> 02:12.333
Stephen Crane.

02:12.366 --> 02:14.435
TB.

02:15.936 --> 02:19.407
Just a little trivia.

02:19.440 --> 02:22.210
Nice. Very cheery.

02:25.613 --> 02:26.947
"He adopted toward him

02:26.980 --> 02:29.717
"an air of patronizing
good humor.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.720
His self-pride was
now entirely restored."

02:35.289 --> 02:36.890
I like this place already.

02:36.924 --> 02:37.858
I don't think they're
going to be giving away

02:37.891 --> 02:39.393
free donuts every day.

02:39.427 --> 02:40.861
Why not? Bars
give away free peanuts.

02:40.894 --> 02:43.297
Only so you'll get thirsty
and buy more beer.

02:43.331 --> 02:46.400
They gave away donuts,
people would buy more coffee.

02:46.434 --> 02:49.870
Please!
Can you help me?

02:49.903 --> 02:51.772
I think I'm having
a miscarriage.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.441
How many weeks?
24.

02:53.474 --> 02:54.442
First pregnancy?

02:54.475 --> 02:55.843
First one to last
this long.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.678
Oh, she's adorable.

02:57.711 --> 02:58.746
Yeah, I found six of them
behind my apartment.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.281
She's the last one.

03:00.314 --> 03:02.250
They don't allow pets
in my building.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.418
They're not allowed
in here either.

03:04.452 --> 03:05.753
Hey, buddy,
you want a donut?

03:05.786 --> 03:06.854
Frank!

03:06.887 --> 03:08.356
What?
Dogs love donuts.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.391
Want a pooch?
Free to a good home.

03:10.424 --> 03:11.859
Dogs irritate
my asthma.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.494
Hi, I'm Terra King
from Ladokern.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.696
I have gifts and some snacks
for the residents.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.465
Is there someplace
I can set up?

03:17.498 --> 03:20.401
Lester, Lester, can you
take care of this, please?

03:20.434 --> 03:21.569
What's wrong with him?

03:21.602 --> 03:22.836
C'mon. Punch it,
cat daddy.

03:22.870 --> 03:23.837
What are you guys watching?

03:23.871 --> 03:24.772
Carjacking.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.440
Pratt...

03:26.474 --> 03:28.576
He needs to get on Lower Wacker
to lose the chopper.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.744
This is Denny. She's having
vaginal bleeding at 24 weeks.

03:30.778 --> 03:31.745
Can you take her?

03:31.779 --> 03:32.980
Sure, sure, let's go.

03:33.013 --> 03:35.015
You cheering for
the carjacker to get away?

03:35.048 --> 03:36.517
No, no, we just want him
to get a few more blocks.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.319
Once he's south of Van Buren

03:38.352 --> 03:40.621
he'll be out of our catchment
and goes to Mercy.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.390
If there's a crash....

03:42.423 --> 03:43.557
There's always a crash.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.659
Turn left.
Get on the expressway...

03:45.693 --> 03:48.662
Yes, yes, go, go!
Oh, oh!
Go, go!

03:48.696 --> 03:50.664
Ooh...
Damn it.

03:52.000 --> 03:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:41.915 --> 04:43.451
I realize you have
friends downstairs.

04:43.484 --> 04:44.552
You mustn't let them
take advantage of you.

04:44.585 --> 04:45.486
Well, the patient
was borderline.

04:45.519 --> 04:46.887
Which is precisely my point.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.522
He needs to stay in the ER
under observation.

04:48.556 --> 04:50.424
If his condition worsens,
I'll go back down.

04:50.458 --> 04:51.792
You know as well as I do
they're only too happy

04:51.825 --> 04:54.762
to free up beds by dumping
patients onto surgery.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.564
Dr. Corday,
they need you in post-op

04:56.597 --> 04:59.700
and the ER is calling
for a gallstone panck consult.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.469
All right, you go
down there.

05:01.502 --> 05:02.936
Make your assessment
and call me.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.805
Be strong.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.540
Collies fracture.

05:06.574 --> 05:08.676
Put on a sugar tong splint
and have him come back

05:08.709 --> 05:10.478
in two days for casting
after the swelling goes down.

05:10.511 --> 05:11.379
Vicodin for pain.

05:11.412 --> 05:12.913
What about a wrist film?

05:12.946 --> 05:15.115
It's not deformed.
Distal neuro-circ intact.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.884
We'll get an x-ray
when we cast.

05:16.917 --> 05:19.420
Malik, get six units
of O-neg down here

05:19.453 --> 05:20.788
before the car crash
starts rolling in.

05:20.821 --> 05:21.922
I already
ordered eight.

05:21.955 --> 05:23.424
Tell me about the gallbladder.

05:23.457 --> 05:26.093
Um, fat and 40
with a history of gallstones.

05:26.126 --> 05:27.595
I gave her a shot
of Toradol.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.430
She's afebrile.
Abdomen is non-tender.

05:29.463 --> 05:30.464
Good.
Send her home.

05:30.498 --> 05:31.632
No ultrasound?

05:31.665 --> 05:33.901
No. No labs,
no IV, no x-rays.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.068
Tell her to stick
to a low-fat diet.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.704
How'd you do this?

05:36.737 --> 05:38.639
I was using a utility knife
to open up a box.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.741
Be more careful.
Keep it clean and dry.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.576
Come back in two days
for a wound check.

05:42.610 --> 05:43.877
What's this?

05:43.911 --> 05:45.746
A 24-year-old female
with bladder infection,

05:45.779 --> 05:47.548
positive for leuks,
icon is negative.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.082
I ordered Bactrim
and Pyridium.

05:49.116 --> 05:52.152
Good. Tell her to pee
after she has sex.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.688
It's a good way
to prevent UTIs.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.857
Coop, your
subconjunctival hemorrhage

05:56.890 --> 05:58.426
probably happened from sneezing

05:58.459 --> 06:00.528
and it will get better
in a week.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.796
Reassure your patient
that he won't go blind

06:02.830 --> 06:04.798
and get him out of here.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.534
( applause )

06:06.567 --> 06:07.868
Five patients
in two minutes.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.169
That's got to be
some kind of record.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.804
Just make sure
you're not skimping.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.072
Skimping?
Yeah, on
the billing.

06:12.105 --> 06:14.007
Check off a few more boxes
next time.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.143
I'm not billing for treatment
we didn't provide.

06:16.176 --> 06:19.613
It's called capitalism, Kovac.
It pays your salary.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.850
Okay, there's
the heartbeat.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.985
Amniotic fluid
index is good.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.620
Excellent
fetal movement.

06:26.654 --> 06:27.921
He's good?

06:27.955 --> 06:30.458
Yeah, but you're dilated
three centimeters.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.159
I've already had
two miscarriages.

06:32.192 --> 06:34.795
I was supposed to start
bed rest next week.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.163
I can't go
through this again.

06:36.196 --> 06:37.665
I'm going to give you
some medicine

06:37.698 --> 06:39.500
to prevent you
from going into labor.

06:39.533 --> 06:42.670
Junior needs
a few more weeks
before he's done.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.938
Start with .25 of terbutaline
sub-Q

06:44.972 --> 06:46.940
and give four grams of mag.

06:46.974 --> 06:49.176
Here, magnesium might
make you a little queasy.

06:49.209 --> 06:52.145
I'll be back
in a few minutes to
check on you, okay?

06:52.179 --> 06:54.515
Hey, Jerry, what's the ETA
on our car crash?

06:54.548 --> 06:55.649
Two minutes
and counting.

06:55.683 --> 06:57.017
Dr. Pratt,
can I present a patient?

06:57.050 --> 06:58.686
Oh, you better
make it fast.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.654
23-year-old woman with sudden
onset occipital headache,

07:00.688 --> 07:01.855
grade 8 out of 10.

07:01.889 --> 07:02.923
Worst headache
of her life?

07:02.956 --> 07:03.891
Close, but not quite.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.192
Thunderclap onset?

07:05.225 --> 07:06.960
More like two minutes.
No history of migraine.

07:06.994 --> 07:08.128
Neuro exam is non-focal.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.630
Okay, okay,
get a head CT,

07:09.663 --> 07:10.998
and rule out
subarachnoid hemorrhage,

07:11.031 --> 07:11.965
and get ten of MS
for the pain.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.602
Thanks.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.670
Kevin Dunn, 32-year-old
driver, high-speed MVA

07:16.704 --> 07:17.771
with prolonged extraction.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.039
The jacker
or the victim?

07:19.072 --> 07:20.608
Jacker. The victim's
right behind us.

07:20.641 --> 07:23.777
Lap belt. Front-end impact.
BP: 104/84, pulse 106.

07:23.811 --> 07:24.978
Creamed the next guy
real good.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.514
Yeah, I know.
We were watching.

07:26.514 --> 07:28.148
Should have turned left
on Stanton, Sparky.

07:28.181 --> 07:31.652
I would have got away
if that jerk didn't cut me off.

07:31.685 --> 07:32.820
( screaming )

07:32.853 --> 07:33.987
Oh, looks like a big
flail segment

07:34.021 --> 07:35.523
and a closed clavicle fracture.

07:35.523 --> 07:36.189
Let's put him
in Trauma Two.

07:36.223 --> 07:37.658
Driver numero dos.

07:37.691 --> 07:38.959
Thomas Collins--
aka innocent victim.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.628
High-speed restrained
impact with head injury.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.530
Turn him. Turn him.
Turn him.

07:42.563 --> 07:43.897
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

07:43.931 --> 07:45.633
I put Mrs. Walters
in Exam Two.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.735
She needs a little TLC,
maybe some Zoloft.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.803
That makes two of us.
Look at them.

07:49.837 --> 07:52.105
They're like kids
in a candy store.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.107
One hospital I worked at
tried to ban the drug reps,

07:54.141 --> 07:56.076
but the residents
all complained

07:56.109 --> 07:57.645
because they like
all the free food.

07:57.678 --> 07:58.812
Yeah, that's how they
get you hooked:

07:58.846 --> 07:59.880
free food, free equipment...

07:59.913 --> 08:01.181
Oh, don't forget
the boobs.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.083
I imagine they have
to pay for those.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.652
Keep Kovac away
from her.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.554
He's been known to give away
free physicals.

08:07.621 --> 08:10.123
Okay, Ernie, where were we?

08:10.157 --> 08:11.725
I got worms.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.096
What the hell is this?

08:16.129 --> 08:17.197
Uh, looks like a hospital bill.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.832
Accounting's on the fifth floor.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.267
No, I was already there.
They wouldn't help me.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.069
Well, I can't either.
This is the ER.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.004
All right, Ernie,
those are maggots.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.939
When was the last time
you changed this bandage?

08:25.973 --> 08:27.975
Look, look,
I was already there, okay?

08:28.008 --> 08:29.977
I sat in here
for 11 hours

08:30.010 --> 08:31.144
with my sick kid

08:31.178 --> 08:32.913
to have some quack

08:32.946 --> 08:35.015
tell me it was a virus
and he'd get better on his own.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.116
Did he?

08:36.149 --> 08:38.586
They didn't do anything for him

08:38.619 --> 08:40.821
and I get a bill
for over two grand?

08:40.854 --> 08:43.190
I want to see the doctor
who stiffed me.

08:43.222 --> 08:44.992
Carter.
I want to see this Carter guy.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.326
He doesn't work
here anymore.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.895
( yells )
All right, Ernie.

08:47.928 --> 08:48.996
Here's what
we're going to do.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.263
Fix you up
with a nurse,

08:50.297 --> 08:51.231
maybe have
something to eat,

08:51.264 --> 08:52.733
and a bath.

08:52.766 --> 08:54.702
But your friends there--
they gotta go.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.637
I want this fixed!

08:56.670 --> 08:58.038
I wouldn't do that, sir.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.773
Are you going to do something
about this bill?

08:59.807 --> 09:01.308
Are you going to get off
your ass and do something?!

09:01.341 --> 09:02.910
No...

09:02.943 --> 09:04.978
But he is.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.049
Dr. Kovac!

09:09.082 --> 09:11.619
Zack Isley, six-foot
fall onto gravel,

09:11.619 --> 09:12.986
no LOC, GCS 15.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.722
Superficial lacs
and abrasions on head

09:14.755 --> 09:15.923
and right upper extremity.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.190
Complaining
of right shoulder pain.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.025
Hey, Zack.
I'm Dr. Kovac.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.793
What happened?

09:19.827 --> 09:21.862
Nothing really. Just goofing
around, took a header.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.330
Can you straighten
your arm?

09:23.363 --> 09:25.666
Ah...
Okay, Curtain Two.

09:25.699 --> 09:26.967
I just sprained it.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.736
Why don't you
let me decide that.

09:28.769 --> 09:29.803
We'll get you an x-ray.

09:29.837 --> 09:30.871
Clean those cuts and scrapes.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.072
Might even need
some stitches.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.373
Really?

09:33.406 --> 09:34.642
Ah, don't worry.
We'll numb you up.

09:34.642 --> 09:35.843
You won't even feel it.

09:35.876 --> 09:38.846
No, ah, no medicine.
I can take it.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.914
Tough guy, huh?

09:40.948 --> 09:43.283
Trauma panel, a clot,
lateral C-spine,

09:43.316 --> 09:45.118
chest x-ray
and AP pelvis.

09:45.152 --> 09:46.654
Poor guy's driving
down the street,

09:46.654 --> 09:47.888
minding his own business,
then bam!

09:47.921 --> 09:49.657
Wakes up two days
later in the ICU.

09:49.690 --> 09:50.958
If he wakes up.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.292
Can't see the pupils--
too much blood.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.194
Laps and saline for Abby.
Chest is clear.

09:54.227 --> 09:57.397
BP is 140/94, pulse 72.
IV is blown.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.966
How are we doing
in here?

09:58.999 --> 10:00.668
Well, he's going to
need to be tubed.

10:00.701 --> 10:01.935
But we got it covered. Thanks.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.236
Abby, can you start an IV?

10:03.270 --> 10:05.038
Nurses start IVs.

10:05.072 --> 10:06.740
Surgical students
do cut-downs.

10:06.774 --> 10:08.175
Spank 'em, Abby.
That's the way.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.643
Somebody get me
a central line kit?

10:09.677 --> 10:10.644
Yeah, I'll send one back.

10:10.678 --> 10:12.412
On the monitor,
BP: 106/80,

10:12.445 --> 10:13.947
tachy at 111.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.248
They need
a triple lurnen kit next door.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.050
I can't see into
his oral airway.

10:17.084 --> 10:18.385
No blood in the nares
or around the mouth.
You're good.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.220
SonoSite
for Dr. Cooper.

10:20.253 --> 10:22.990
Pain meds on the fly,
but let's complete the survey.

10:23.023 --> 10:25.025
He's decreased on the left.
Size six sterile gloves, please.

10:25.058 --> 10:28.762
BP's 104/86.
Sats 92.

10:28.796 --> 10:30.898
All right, kids, you're on.
Show Dr. Chen what you know.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.833
Free fluid in the abdomen
and pericolic gutter.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.301
Try there.

10:34.334 --> 10:35.769
You could use a little
more jelly on your belly.

10:35.803 --> 10:36.970
You're
the attending.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.371
NEELA:
And in Morrison's pouch.

10:38.405 --> 10:39.807
Meaning?

10:39.840 --> 10:41.041
Intra-abdominal injury

10:41.074 --> 10:42.175
secondary to
high-speed mechanism.

10:42.209 --> 10:43.844
He'll need the OR.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.212
Start the chest tube.
I'll be right back.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.747
Don't be a stranger.

10:48.348 --> 10:49.883
The guy next door
needs a surgeon.

10:49.917 --> 10:50.884
I'll call Corday.

10:50.918 --> 10:52.219
Mommy, Mommy,
come save me.

10:52.252 --> 10:53.854
I'll decide if he
needs surgery.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.155
He's only responding
to pain.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.324
Urine output's good.
Okay, laryngoscope.

10:57.357 --> 10:58.992
Ah, no, Surgi-Girl,
go next door.

10:59.026 --> 11:00.160
Start the workup.

11:00.193 --> 11:01.261
Yeah, I was going
to intubate.

11:01.294 --> 11:04.031
Next time.
Now, go, go, shoo.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.365
Get me a staple gun.

11:05.398 --> 11:07.134
I'll start putting
this guy back together.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.468
I can feel the inside
of the chest wall.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.403
Surgery is here.
Hello, surgery.

11:10.437 --> 11:12.105
( alarm beeping )
Abby, can you turn
that damn thing off?

11:12.139 --> 11:13.306
Yeah.

11:13.340 --> 11:14.775
Okay, leave
the guide finger in

11:14.808 --> 11:16.043
with the other hand.

11:16.076 --> 11:17.310
Slide the tube through.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.112
Got it.
Got it.

11:19.146 --> 11:20.948
Sats are up. 98%.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.182
Thanks.
Nice job.

11:22.215 --> 11:23.483
Okay, Abby,
give me the bullet.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.953
I, I was trying
to fix the monitor.

11:25.986 --> 11:28.856
Oh, you're a med student,
a nurse, and a technician now.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.123
What's next, cowgirl?

11:30.157 --> 11:31.391
Yo, Abby.
I'm pushing the drugs.

11:31.424 --> 11:32.893
You want this or not?
Yes.

11:32.926 --> 11:33.493
I told you
to evaluate this patient.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.262
I can do it.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.363
I don't care who does it,
as long as it gets done.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.098
Neela, go with
Dr. Pratt.

11:38.131 --> 11:40.267
You can come back
and sew these in
when you're done.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.334
Well?

11:46.506 --> 11:48.208
No fracture or dislocation.

11:48.241 --> 11:50.210
You probably just strained
the ligaments a bit.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.012
Told you.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.446
Maybe you should be a doctor.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.849
Yeah, not with my grades.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.417
I wasn't a great student
at your age.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.286
I almost failed
lunch. Ow! Ow!

11:59.319 --> 12:00.921
Sorry.

12:00.954 --> 12:02.856
Kovac, this guy's here
for your patient.

12:02.890 --> 12:05.125
Ron Kennedy,
I'm a social worker
from Stanton House.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.995
We're a foster care facility.
Zack's one of our residents.

12:08.028 --> 12:10.097
You mean prisoners.
Relax.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.264
I'm his case worker.

12:11.298 --> 12:12.900
Zack hopped a fence

12:12.933 --> 12:14.167
while we were
on an outing
and ran off.

12:14.201 --> 12:15.803
I escaped, you Nazi.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.137
Listen, you'll have
to call my mom.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.538
I'm not going back there.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.240
Zack has a conduct disorder.
Screw you!

12:20.273 --> 12:22.109
Hey, could you give us
a moment, please?

12:22.142 --> 12:23.343
I think he's off his meds.

12:23.376 --> 12:24.912
Back off, man!
Hey, stop it, Zack.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.346
He needs Haldol.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.415
And you need to go back
to the waiting room, okay?

12:28.448 --> 12:29.549
Get the hell out of here!

12:29.582 --> 12:30.918
Get back in bed, Zack.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.019
He needs to be sedated!

12:32.052 --> 12:34.054
Out!

12:34.087 --> 12:35.388
Hey!

12:35.422 --> 12:37.825
I'm not going back there.

12:37.858 --> 12:41.094
Please, don't let them
take me back.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.531
Please....

12:47.367 --> 12:48.168
Third crit is down to 29.
Done.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.069
All right, let's roll.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.137
Call Corday, and tell her

12:50.170 --> 12:51.371
I'm sending her up
a gift basket.

12:51.404 --> 12:52.439
That looks good,
but if it comes out,

12:52.472 --> 12:53.440
you owe Dr. Chen
and me a beer.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.108
I'm more
of a cosmo girl.

12:55.142 --> 12:57.945
The drink or
the magazine?
A little of both.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.146
Did neurosurgery agree?

12:59.179 --> 12:59.980
Yeah, diffuse
axonal injury.

13:00.013 --> 13:01.481
No operative lesion.

13:01.514 --> 13:03.016
They'll sign off after
the second apnea test.

13:03.050 --> 13:04.384
He's brain-dead?
Yes.

13:04.417 --> 13:05.853
Bad guy gets
patched up.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.087
His victim ends
up a vegetable.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.321
Well, we haven't saved
this guy yet.

13:08.355 --> 13:09.522
You can change
that head dressing, Abby.

13:09.556 --> 13:10.958
Okay. Which OR
is he going to?

13:10.991 --> 13:12.492
That's not your business.
Call UNOS.

13:12.525 --> 13:16.196
Your butt's down
here until the
coordinator arrives.

13:17.397 --> 13:18.298
Aah! Ow!

13:18.331 --> 13:20.067
You wouldn't feel it

13:20.100 --> 13:23.536
if you let me use
just a little
analgesic gel.

13:23.570 --> 13:26.907
For six months I've been
on Tegretol, lithium,

13:26.940 --> 13:30.110
Risperdal, clonidine,
Benadryl and Klonopin, okay?

13:30.143 --> 13:32.212
I've been so doped up
I didn't know what day it was.

13:32.245 --> 13:34.214
Have you been cheeking
your meds?

13:34.247 --> 13:37.550
Had to. Today's the first day
I felt normal in months.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.286
That why you ran away?

13:39.319 --> 13:41.588
I got tired of being
a freaking zombie.

13:41.621 --> 13:42.589
Did you call my parents?

13:42.622 --> 13:44.457
Your mother's on her way.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.960
You're not going to let them
take me back, are you?

13:46.994 --> 13:48.028
We'll talk about it

13:48.061 --> 13:50.030
when your mom gets here, okay?

13:58.105 --> 13:59.039
Hey, Pratt?

13:59.072 --> 14:00.207
Huh?

14:00.240 --> 14:01.374
This scan's negative.

14:01.408 --> 14:02.309
Yeah. I'm still waiting

14:02.342 --> 14:03.510
on a neurology consult

14:03.543 --> 14:04.978
to evaluate
a possible subarachnoid.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.079
Do an LP.

14:06.113 --> 14:07.480
No. They'll be here any minute.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.616
You're wasting time
and resources.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.051
What's his problem?

14:11.084 --> 14:12.419
You mean besides
being tackled

14:12.452 --> 14:13.486
in the waiting room?

14:13.520 --> 14:14.654
Possible new onset angina.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.123
I've ordered nitro,

14:16.156 --> 14:18.058
CBC, chem panel,
serial... troponins

14:18.091 --> 14:19.159
and a chest x-ray.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.061
And I'm still waiting on cards.

14:21.094 --> 14:22.295
EKG's normal?

14:22.329 --> 14:23.563
Yeah.

14:23.596 --> 14:24.998
You smoke?

14:25.032 --> 14:25.565
No.

14:25.598 --> 14:26.934
Hypertension?

14:26.967 --> 14:28.635
High cholesterol, diabetes?

14:28.668 --> 14:30.403
No. I'm healthy.

14:30.437 --> 14:31.604
I run about
12 miles a week.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.006
Okay, let me guess.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.008
The pain started
after your incident

14:35.042 --> 14:36.009
in the waiting room.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.010
Yeah.

14:37.044 --> 14:39.046
It's an anxiety attack.

14:39.079 --> 14:41.014
Over this stupid
hospital bill?

14:41.048 --> 14:42.149
Probably.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.383
Let me see it.

14:43.416 --> 14:45.118
What was the complaint?

14:45.152 --> 14:47.120
My kid came in
with a fever.

14:47.154 --> 14:50.123
Your son didn't need that.

14:50.157 --> 14:52.259
Certainly didn't
need a chem panel

14:52.292 --> 14:54.427
and two sets of
blood cultures.

14:54.461 --> 14:58.531
You should have only
been charged for, what-- $300.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.067
Thanks.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.268
Hey, Slavko.

15:01.301 --> 15:02.402
What the hell do you
think this is--

15:02.435 --> 15:03.236
some Zagreb Yugo dealership?

15:03.270 --> 15:04.471
On the rare occasion

15:04.504 --> 15:06.006
when we do get a patient
with insurance,

15:06.039 --> 15:08.308
we don't give them deals.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.610
I expect that kind of idiocy
from Pratt, not from you.

15:13.313 --> 15:15.282
I thought I was
his favorite.

15:15.315 --> 15:16.649
Hi. I'm Terra King.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.551
Have you heard
of Quinamax?

15:18.585 --> 15:20.453
It's our new once-a-day
antibiotic

15:20.487 --> 15:22.489
with excellent coverage
for bronchitis

15:22.522 --> 15:24.091
and otitis media.

15:24.124 --> 15:26.726
Neither of which needs treatment
with antibiotics.

15:26.759 --> 15:29.596
Now, it has great
gram-positive coverage,

15:29.629 --> 15:32.432
making it ideal
for cellulitis.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.034
LEWIS:
I have a patient

15:34.067 --> 15:35.502
coming in at 3:00 to
check a didge level--

15:35.535 --> 15:37.004
Ben Hollander.

15:37.004 --> 15:38.071
When he shows up,
just let him in

15:38.105 --> 15:38.571
and come find
me, okay?

15:38.605 --> 15:40.240
Sure thing.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.641
Hey, what's up?

15:41.674 --> 15:43.443
I've got a
27-year-old
G3P-zero,

15:43.476 --> 15:45.345
history of cervical
incompetence,

15:45.378 --> 15:46.513
EGA 24 weeks.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.281
Presented in
early labor,

15:48.315 --> 15:50.283
cervical dilation
progressed from
three to six

15:50.317 --> 15:51.518
on terb and mag.

15:51.551 --> 15:52.452
Any fetal distress?

15:52.485 --> 15:53.686
No. It looks good.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.455
Heart rates in the 160s,
good variability.

15:55.488 --> 15:56.756
Can you repeat the terb?

15:56.789 --> 15:59.126
No. We maxed out,
and she's tachy.

15:59.159 --> 16:01.428
Send her up to labor
and delivery, and tell them

16:01.461 --> 16:03.030
to have a pedes
resuscitation team standing by.

16:03.030 --> 16:04.164
If she's progressing
on tocolytics,

16:04.197 --> 16:06.299
there's nothing
we can do.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.567
She's revealing
both her upper

16:07.600 --> 16:09.202
and lower teeth
when she laughs.

16:09.236 --> 16:10.470
What?

16:10.503 --> 16:11.738
Chen. It's a
sign of flirting.

16:11.771 --> 16:12.672
There. Hair touching--

16:12.705 --> 16:13.740
that's another one.

16:13.773 --> 16:14.741
You better get
in there, sport,

16:14.774 --> 16:15.708
before it's too late.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.077
What are you talking about?

16:17.110 --> 16:18.545
I was a cop
25 years.

16:18.578 --> 16:19.479
You learn
body language.

16:19.512 --> 16:20.480
Look at that.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.382
She's mirroring his motion.

16:22.415 --> 16:25.285
20 bucks says
she touches him next.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.219
( laughing )

16:26.253 --> 16:27.720
So what?
She slapped him.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.489
First it's a slap,
then it's a tickle.

16:29.522 --> 16:32.259
Before you know it,
she'll be spanking his ass.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.094
Hey, Jerry, can you call up
to L&D and tell them

16:34.127 --> 16:35.295
to make sure
that they have my...?

16:35.328 --> 16:36.763
I need to find
a fire hydrant.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.598
Hey, that's a cute puppy.
Can I hold it?

16:38.631 --> 16:40.467
You can have it.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.369
43-year-old man
with left flank pain

16:42.402 --> 16:43.770
radiating to the groin.

16:43.803 --> 16:45.272
Denies fever, vomiting.

16:45.305 --> 16:47.074
Exams notable for CVA tenderness
on the left.

16:47.107 --> 16:48.308
Urine heme-positive.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.442
Okay. Diagnosis?

16:49.476 --> 16:50.610
Kidney stones.

16:50.643 --> 16:51.778
What else?

16:51.811 --> 16:54.481
CBC, chem panel,
and CT urogram.

16:54.514 --> 16:57.184
Okay. And give 30
of ketorolac IV push.

16:57.217 --> 16:59.286
No.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.654
No CBC, no chem panel,
and no CT.

17:01.688 --> 17:04.324
You don't even
need a damn IV.

17:04.357 --> 17:07.127
It's expensive
and it takes up nursing time.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.728
Give him 60 of ketorolac IM

17:08.761 --> 17:10.597
and a bedside ultrasound
to rule out hydronephrosis.

17:10.630 --> 17:11.763
But you won't see
where the stone is.

17:11.798 --> 17:12.464
Look, hospital
policy says...

17:12.499 --> 17:14.134
90% of cases

17:14.166 --> 17:15.402
pass on their own.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.104
He's afebrile,
and his UA is negative.

17:17.104 --> 17:18.704
And if it's too
big to pass?

17:18.738 --> 17:21.174
It'll cause hydronephrosis,
and he'll come back.

17:24.477 --> 17:25.712
He still thinks
he's in the Congo.

17:25.744 --> 17:27.780
Get the CT.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.219
You need to take him up.

17:32.252 --> 17:33.386
That's not
how it works.

17:33.420 --> 17:34.387
I come down,
I see, I present.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.123
Yeah, I know how it works.

17:36.123 --> 17:38.125
And I'm telling you
as a surgeon and head of the ER,

17:38.125 --> 17:39.826
you need to take this guy up
to your service.

17:39.859 --> 17:42.195
What do you need me to do,
write you a damn note?

17:42.229 --> 17:44.531
"Dear Dr. Corday, please admit
Abby's patient to your service.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.566
"He's very sick today
and requires an exp lap

17:46.599 --> 17:48.635
before he gets septic and dies."

17:50.270 --> 17:51.471
You hanging in there?

17:51.504 --> 17:52.439
By a thread.

17:52.472 --> 17:53.640
Dr. Lewis,
can you help me?

17:53.673 --> 17:54.841
Sure. Which patient?

17:54.874 --> 17:56.543
Actually,
it's about the doctors.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.146
I'm getting conflicting advice
from Pratt and Kovac.

17:59.146 --> 18:00.413
Welcome to County.

18:00.447 --> 18:02.682
Kovac is the attending.
Pratt isn't.

18:02.715 --> 18:03.850
Abby,

18:03.883 --> 18:05.485
this is Patricia Collins.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.720
Her husband was involved
in the car chase.

18:07.754 --> 18:08.888
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.257
Hi. Abby Lockhart.
Hi.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.424
I'm Neela.
Hi.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.460
I worked on your husband.

18:13.493 --> 18:14.294
Would you like to see him?

18:14.327 --> 18:15.328
Yes.

18:15.362 --> 18:16.596
I'll take Mrs. Collins in

18:16.629 --> 18:18.531
while you're waiting
for the UNOS team.

18:18.565 --> 18:20.533
This way, please.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.170
I'm beginning
to hate her.

18:23.170 --> 18:26.206
She's a med student.

18:26.239 --> 18:27.874
I'm a med student.

18:27.907 --> 18:29.376
You know,
now that you mention it,

18:29.409 --> 18:30.577
she's pissing me off, too.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.445
Come on.
Let's hate her together.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.347
Now, the medicine I gave you
hasn't stopped you

18:34.381 --> 18:36.249
from going into labor.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.818
Your contractions are
increasing in frequency,

18:38.851 --> 18:41.221
and your cervix is
continuing to dilate.

18:41.254 --> 18:43.923
My husband had to go
to Seattle for work.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.625
He didn't want to go,

18:45.658 --> 18:48.428
but I said, "Don't worry.
I'll be fine."

18:48.461 --> 18:50.730
I can't believe
I'm having another miscarriage.

18:50.763 --> 18:53.233
No. You're not
miscarrying, Denny.

18:53.266 --> 18:55.202
You're going to
have this baby.

18:55.202 --> 18:56.603
I'm sending you
up to obstetrics.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.538
They're set up to handle
a preemie delivery.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.640
I don't want a preemie.

19:00.673 --> 19:04.511
Our NICU cares for babies
like this all the time.

19:04.544 --> 19:06.846
Yeah, babies with brain damage.

19:06.879 --> 19:07.747
My sister-in-law
had a preemie.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.349
It was sick for months.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.451
They spent every day
in the NICU, and it still died.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.519
This baby has a chance.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.854
I don't want it this way!

19:14.887 --> 19:17.224
Okay.

19:17.224 --> 19:18.225
Okay.

19:21.628 --> 19:22.929
Problem?

19:22.962 --> 19:24.497
She doesn't want
to have the baby.

19:24.531 --> 19:26.233
She's 24 weeks.

19:26.266 --> 19:27.234
What's the weight?

19:27.267 --> 19:28.935
520 grams on the ultrasound.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.670
24 weeks, over
500 grams--

19:30.703 --> 19:33.373
that's the hospital's
viability threshold.

19:33.406 --> 19:34.507
So what? We're
going to spend

19:34.541 --> 19:35.575
half a million
dollars

19:35.608 --> 19:36.709
keeping one
baby alive

19:36.743 --> 19:37.577
while we shut
down the lead

19:37.610 --> 19:38.978
eradication program?

19:39.011 --> 19:41.248
I've admitted three kids
for chelation this week.

19:41.281 --> 19:42.782
Why stamp out
lead poisoning

19:42.815 --> 19:44.351
when you can shoot your wad
on one little gorker

19:44.384 --> 19:45.585
who can enjoy a lifetime
of special ed?

19:45.618 --> 19:46.519
Good thinking, Pratt.

19:46.553 --> 19:47.987
What am I supposed to do?

19:48.020 --> 19:49.289
Mom doesn't want to do anything
to save this baby.

19:49.322 --> 19:50.257
She doesn't
have any rights.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.291
It's not up to Mom.

19:51.324 --> 19:52.492
If it's over 500 grams,

19:52.525 --> 19:53.726
pedes is going
to resuscitate.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.295
Aren't you on
a surgical rotation?

19:55.328 --> 19:56.829
Yup.
Then rotate.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.366
What's this kid's chance
of having a normal life?

19:59.399 --> 20:00.467
10%? Less?

20:00.500 --> 20:01.968
It's hospital policy, Luka.

20:02.001 --> 20:03.436
Then maybe she needs
to change the hospital.

20:03.470 --> 20:04.304
Another
good idea.

20:04.337 --> 20:05.338
Let's send her

20:05.372 --> 20:06.739
to Santa Nina
Muerta Hospital.

20:06.773 --> 20:07.674
It's called natural
selection, Pratt.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.242
You ever heard of it?

20:09.276 --> 20:11.711
It's worked for a
few million years.

20:11.744 --> 20:14.481
So, tell me, what
should I do now?

20:14.514 --> 20:17.684
Hospital policy exists
for a reason.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.653
First learn the rules,
then learn when to break them.

20:20.687 --> 20:23.490
What's in her best interest?

20:23.523 --> 20:25.258
The laceration
is superficial,

20:25.292 --> 20:27.026
and his shoulder
is only bruised,

20:27.059 --> 20:28.961
but, uh, I do have
some concerns

20:28.995 --> 20:31.864
about the
medication he's on.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.533
Zack's had some problems.

20:33.566 --> 20:34.867
Had.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.536
I'm fine now.

20:36.569 --> 20:39.539
I think he may be overmedicated.

20:39.572 --> 20:42.008
Well, they told me
that was for his own good.

20:44.377 --> 20:47.514
I had a drug problem.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.849
I let him run wild.

20:49.882 --> 20:52.585
And then he was always doing
this crazy stuff.

20:52.619 --> 20:53.920
He got into fights.

20:53.953 --> 20:56.789
It's called
self-defense.

20:56.823 --> 20:58.725
He stole a car.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.059
One time.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.695
I'm not doing that
anymore.

21:03.996 --> 21:06.699
They blamed it on me.

21:06.733 --> 21:10.537
They said I was
an unfit mother.

21:10.570 --> 21:12.805
Do you have custody?

21:12.839 --> 21:16.876
Not at the moment.

21:16.909 --> 21:18.511
Has Ben Hollander shown up yet?

21:18.545 --> 21:20.947
Not that I've seen.

21:20.980 --> 21:24.417
Can you look at a possible
scaphoid fracture in Exam Three?

21:24.451 --> 21:26.553
Uh, yeah. Hold
on a second.

21:26.586 --> 21:29.356
Mrs. Collins refused
to donate her husband's organs.

21:29.356 --> 21:31.023
I've heard minority families
seldom agree

21:31.057 --> 21:32.459
to organ donation anyway.

21:32.492 --> 21:34.026
Well, what,
did you just let her leave?

21:34.060 --> 21:35.628
I thought she could sit
with the body

21:35.662 --> 21:36.929
until he went up to the ICU.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.798
I'm looking for Dr. Pratt.

21:38.831 --> 21:39.499
Greg!

21:39.532 --> 21:41.501
There he is.

21:41.534 --> 21:43.403
It's 2003. Who
doesn't have an
answering machine?

21:43.436 --> 21:46.072
He promised me. We had
a therapeutic contract.

21:46.105 --> 21:48.074
Look, I'm sure
he's just running late.

21:48.107 --> 21:50.109
Maybe he stopped
to get a coffee or...

21:50.142 --> 21:52.379
Jump off a bridge?

21:54.013 --> 21:55.482
Hi. Are you
from neonatology?

21:55.515 --> 21:56.883
Yeah. Vargas.
Where's your patient?

21:56.916 --> 21:59.051
Her name is Den...

21:59.085 --> 22:01.554
Hey, Lily,
where's Denny?

22:01.588 --> 22:03.022
I haven't seen her.

22:03.055 --> 22:03.890
Well, can you check
the women's bathrooms

22:03.923 --> 22:05.592
for me, please?

22:05.625 --> 22:06.726
Sure.
Just give me one
second, all right?

22:06.759 --> 22:09.496
I'll find her.

22:11.498 --> 22:12.532
She left.

22:12.565 --> 22:13.533
Who?

22:13.566 --> 22:14.534
My pregnant patient.

22:14.567 --> 22:15.402
Did you talk to her?

22:15.402 --> 22:16.469
No.

22:16.503 --> 22:17.770
Well, she took
your advice.

22:17.804 --> 22:19.539
She eloped.
That was always her prerogative.

22:19.572 --> 22:20.740
( banging on window )

22:20.773 --> 22:21.774
I need a doctor out here!

22:21.808 --> 22:22.909
That doesn't mean

22:22.942 --> 22:24.511
it was the best thing
for her to do.

22:24.544 --> 22:25.812
Hey, you're supposed
to be teaching me here.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.415
I'm trying,
but you're not listening.

22:28.415 --> 22:29.916
Some lady is in
the back of my cab,

22:29.949 --> 22:31.718
and I think she's
bleeding to death.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.490
Denny, what happened?

22:37.524 --> 22:38.858
I tried to make it
to Saint Joe's,

22:38.891 --> 22:40.092
but the baby's coming.

22:40.126 --> 22:41.060
Is she dying?

22:41.093 --> 22:42.762
No. Run inside and tell them

22:42.795 --> 22:44.464
I need a gurney
and a BOA kit. Go!

22:44.497 --> 22:46.466
This was in her best interest?

22:46.499 --> 22:48.768
She wouldn't have left
if you'd done what she asked.

22:48.801 --> 22:50.470
KOVAC:
Type and cross Mom

22:50.503 --> 22:52.539
for four units,
two large-bore IVs

22:52.572 --> 22:54.474
and a liter of
LR running now.

22:54.507 --> 22:55.908
It's too soon.

22:55.942 --> 22:58.445
All right, Denny,
one big push.

23:01.714 --> 23:02.849
( grunts )

23:02.882 --> 23:04.851
Come on. Cord clamp.

23:08.988 --> 23:09.922
It's a boy.

23:09.956 --> 23:11.624
His eyelids are still fused.

23:19.832 --> 23:21.901
Placenta's delivered.

23:21.934 --> 23:23.135
( alarm beeping )

23:23.169 --> 23:24.671
Bleeding's picking up.

23:24.704 --> 23:26.038
Heart rate's in the 130s.

23:26.072 --> 23:28.841
Yeah, uterine atony
from the tocolytics.

23:28.875 --> 23:32.479
Run in another liter
of LR and 20 of pit.

23:32.512 --> 23:33.613
Do we have
a pulse?

23:33.646 --> 23:34.781
Yeah. It's slow,
under 100.

23:34.814 --> 23:35.848
Should I start
compressions?

23:35.882 --> 23:37.083
Bag him up first.

23:37.116 --> 23:38.585
No. You need to
weigh him first

23:38.618 --> 23:39.952
before you do
anything else.

23:39.986 --> 23:42.755
Less than 500
grams, we stop.

23:42.789 --> 23:44.757
All right, draw up some epi
and get ready with the tube.

23:44.791 --> 23:46.493
KOVAC:
Do not tube that baby

23:46.526 --> 23:48.495
until you get a weight.

23:49.729 --> 23:52.499
DENNY:
No, please.

23:52.532 --> 23:53.900
506.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.602
( sighs )

23:55.635 --> 23:57.604
Pratt, she doesn't want this.

23:57.637 --> 23:59.071
I'm following hospital rules.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.640
That doesn't make it right.

24:00.673 --> 24:02.141
This kid is alive.

24:02.174 --> 24:04.076
Systolic's down to 78.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.178
.2 milligrams
of Methergine IM

24:06.212 --> 24:07.213
and rush the blood bank.

24:07.246 --> 24:09.015
Oh, all right, I'm in.

24:09.048 --> 24:11.518
Bag him and give two cc's
of surfactant through the tube.

24:11.518 --> 24:12.785
You got it.

24:29.536 --> 24:31.771
Mrs. Collins, can I
get you anything,

24:31.804 --> 24:33.606
or anyone I can call?

24:33.640 --> 24:36.008
Tom's sister is coming.

24:36.042 --> 24:37.610
She wanted to say good-bye.

24:37.644 --> 24:39.579
( pager beeps )

24:39.612 --> 24:40.647
Sorry.

24:40.680 --> 24:41.681
PRATT:
Umbilical line kit

24:41.714 --> 24:42.749
and a sterile 6 is for Neela.

24:42.782 --> 24:44.083
She's gonna place the UVC.

24:44.116 --> 24:45.752
KOVAC:
We shouldn't be
doing this, Pratt.

24:45.785 --> 24:48.254
She has the right to
demand a natural death.

24:48.287 --> 24:50.056
We have a Family Room,

24:50.089 --> 24:52.992
if you'd like to wait for your
sister-in-law in there.

24:53.025 --> 24:54.260
It's a little more quiet.

24:54.293 --> 24:56.796
I want to stay with him
as long as I can.

24:56.829 --> 24:57.797
Okay.

25:02.068 --> 25:03.903
What's happening?

25:03.936 --> 25:07.173
They're trying to save
a premature baby.

25:09.308 --> 25:11.277
We just started
trying to have kids.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.790
Mrs. Collins,
did Neela talk to you

25:23.823 --> 25:27.059
about recovering
your husband's organs?

25:27.093 --> 25:28.695
I told her I didn't want that.

25:28.728 --> 25:30.062
He's been through enough.

25:32.665 --> 25:34.901
Why? Does he have something

25:34.934 --> 25:37.870
that could help the mom
or her baby?

25:37.904 --> 25:39.071
I don't know.

25:39.105 --> 25:41.674
Maybe.

25:41.708 --> 25:45.612
But there are lots of others
who would benefit.

25:48.648 --> 25:51.083
Tom was always going
out of his way

25:51.117 --> 25:53.285
to do stuff for
other people...

25:53.319 --> 25:58.090
to the point where they
would take advantage of
him, but he didn't care.

25:58.124 --> 25:59.626
I would always tell him,

25:59.659 --> 26:01.628
"Don't you know
nice guys finish last?"

26:03.362 --> 26:05.164
He would always say,

26:05.197 --> 26:09.636
"Guys who finish
last are nice."

26:09.669 --> 26:11.638
He was so stupid.

26:15.808 --> 26:21.313
What would they do...
if he was a donor?

26:21.347 --> 26:24.651
The recovery team
would take him to the ICU,

26:24.684 --> 26:27.954
and they run tests and they
start matching his organs

26:27.987 --> 26:29.689
to people who need them.

26:29.722 --> 26:30.389
Like his kidneys?

26:30.422 --> 26:32.358
Mm-hmm.

26:32.391 --> 26:34.393
Several organs can be recovered.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.863
He could help as many
as 50 different people.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.332
Tom would like that.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.705
What all would they take?

26:47.974 --> 26:49.676
Well, his kidneys,

26:49.676 --> 26:52.712
which would go to two people
with end-stage renal disease,

26:52.745 --> 26:56.148
and that would free them
from a lifetime of dialysis...

26:56.182 --> 26:59.018
Ben Hollander, Susan Lewis.

26:59.051 --> 27:00.086
No, I'm the doctor.
He's my patient.

27:00.119 --> 27:01.754
County General.

27:01.788 --> 27:03.823
Okay, then I'll talk
to the watch commander.

27:03.856 --> 27:04.691
My mom around?

27:04.691 --> 27:05.958
She's in a trauma.

27:05.992 --> 27:07.093
You want to wait
in the Doctor's lounge?

27:07.126 --> 27:08.795
Nah.

27:08.828 --> 27:10.963
You get any freaks
in here today?

27:10.997 --> 27:13.265
You know,
guys with elephant man disease

27:13.299 --> 27:15.201
and axes stuck in their heads?

27:15.234 --> 27:16.235
No.

27:16.268 --> 27:17.737
Should you be looking
at that?

27:17.770 --> 27:19.238
I'm going to become a doctor.

27:19.271 --> 27:20.840
Dollars to donuts
that kid

27:20.873 --> 27:22.942
is already dissecting
the neighborhood pets.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.376
Every time
you put me on hold,

27:24.410 --> 27:26.913
you're increasing the chance
he's in trouble.

27:26.946 --> 27:28.214
Sure.
Hey.

27:28.247 --> 27:30.883
You want to
see a puppy?

27:30.917 --> 27:33.419
Why?

27:33.452 --> 27:36.222
I don't know.
Because she's cute?

27:36.255 --> 27:38.891
Where's the morgue?

27:38.925 --> 27:42.729
Your mom says we aren't allowed
to let you go to the morgue.

27:42.762 --> 27:44.731
I'll give you five bucks.

27:46.132 --> 27:47.399
Does that kid ever
give you the creeps?

27:47.433 --> 27:49.401
He's right at the age
where it starts.

27:49.435 --> 27:50.903
Teen rebellion?

27:50.937 --> 27:53.105
Devil worship.
Keep an eye on that puppy.

27:57.944 --> 27:59.812
You were supposed
to be here hours ago.

27:59.846 --> 28:01.748
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

28:01.748 --> 28:05.384
Oh, these, uh, these are...
these are for you.

28:05.417 --> 28:07.053
Sort of a peace offering

28:07.086 --> 28:08.955
to make up, you
know, for my...

28:08.988 --> 28:10.790
my-my tardiness.

28:10.823 --> 28:12.324
You didn't have
to do that.

28:12.358 --> 28:13.860
Well, there's
a guy outside,

28:13.893 --> 28:15.828
you know, selling
them on the street,

28:15.862 --> 28:17.964
so it's, you know,
it's no big deal.

28:17.997 --> 28:20.032
Oh, and I...

28:20.066 --> 28:21.367
I brought you, uh...

28:21.400 --> 28:22.769
I brought you this.

28:22.802 --> 28:24.904
We're not finished
reading it.

28:24.937 --> 28:27.439
Well, I, you know,
I know how it ends.

28:27.473 --> 28:30.810
Lily, can you set Ben up
for a blood draw?

28:30.843 --> 28:32.078
Sure. This way, sir.

28:33.913 --> 28:35.514
That patient
brought you flowers?

28:35.547 --> 28:37.449
And a book.
He's a real Civil War buff.

28:37.483 --> 28:38.785
I've been reading it to him.

28:38.818 --> 28:40.086
He's losing his eyesight.

28:40.119 --> 28:41.888
What? You're going
to his house?

28:41.921 --> 28:45.291
Yeah. The guy was a possible OD
on didge a couple weeks ago.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.960
I'm still not sure
it wasn't attempted suicide.

28:47.994 --> 28:50.196
I just want to make sure
he's re-engaged

28:50.229 --> 28:51.397
before I cut him loose.

28:51.430 --> 28:52.932
This is a first edition.

28:52.965 --> 28:55.902
Sounds like he's
engaged with you.

28:55.935 --> 28:58.004
He has no one.
He's going blind.

28:58.037 --> 29:03.175
He sacrificed everything for his
career and now he has nothing.

29:03.209 --> 29:05.945
No one should end up
like that.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.015
Where the hell is OB?

29:09.048 --> 29:10.349
Paged them three times.

29:10.382 --> 29:12.418
Denny, stay with us here.

29:12.451 --> 29:13.385
EBL 1500cc's.

29:13.419 --> 29:15.221
I'm hitting resistance.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.989
When it bounces back like
that, you're in the liver.

29:17.023 --> 29:18.257
Start over
and thread it again.

29:18.290 --> 29:19.325
Get him upstairs, Pratt.

29:19.358 --> 29:20.827
Kovac, I need to talk to you.

29:20.827 --> 29:22.561
I'm kinda busy here.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.330
What's the holdup
with that kid
from Stanton House?

29:24.363 --> 29:25.998
His caseworker
is threatening
legal action.

29:26.032 --> 29:27.900
Still waiting on a Tegretol
level to come back.

29:27.934 --> 29:29.168
No you're not.
It's back.

29:29.201 --> 29:30.937
He can't go back there, Kerry.

29:30.970 --> 29:34.040
Their treatment program is
basically keeping him so drugged

29:34.073 --> 29:36.042
that he can't
think straight.

29:36.075 --> 29:36.976
BP's up to 98/55.

29:37.009 --> 29:38.510
Good. He's a nice kid.

29:38.544 --> 29:40.179
And you know him better
than the psychiatrist

29:40.212 --> 29:42.248
who's been treating him
for two years?

29:42.281 --> 29:44.917
She's got too many patients
to treat properly.

29:44.951 --> 29:46.853
She also has privileges
in this hospital

29:46.853 --> 29:48.554
and she's on her way
to administer Haldol

29:48.587 --> 29:50.322
because the ER physician
apparently refused.

29:50.356 --> 29:52.558
Everybody's so concerned
about the rules and policy

29:52.591 --> 29:55.027
that they're forgetting
there is a kid caught
in the middle of all this.

29:55.061 --> 29:57.463
Reform the foster
care system on
your own time.

29:57.496 --> 29:58.564
Neela, come
with me.

29:58.597 --> 30:00.066
Discharge
this patient.

30:00.099 --> 30:01.400
Damn it, Kerry!

30:01.433 --> 30:03.469
Take the baby.
Pratt, I need you here.

30:03.502 --> 30:05.004
Somebody call for OB?

30:05.037 --> 30:07.339
Now, that was fast.
Fill her in, Pratt.

30:07.373 --> 30:09.408
Mom just delivered
a 24-weeker

30:09.441 --> 30:12.044
now with severe atony,
EBL 1500cc's.

30:12.078 --> 30:13.079
What's happening?

30:13.112 --> 30:14.213
You're doing good.

30:14.246 --> 30:16.082
It looks worse
than it is.

30:16.115 --> 30:18.217
The tube in his mouth
helps him breathe.

30:18.250 --> 30:20.119
The catheters
in his umbilical cord

30:20.152 --> 30:24.323
give him fluid, nutrition
and medication.

30:24.356 --> 30:28.961
But underneath it all,
he looks good for a 24-weeker.

30:28.995 --> 30:30.963
Really...

30:30.997 --> 30:33.432
Where's Zack?

30:33.465 --> 30:35.834
Zack? Zack?

30:40.639 --> 30:41.908
What did she give him?

30:41.941 --> 30:44.276
Four milligrams Haldol IM.

30:44.310 --> 30:48.614
Just to tide him over
till his PO meds kick in.

30:48.647 --> 30:49.348
I'm sorry.

31:02.995 --> 31:06.365
You never let me finish
telling you about Quinamax.

31:06.398 --> 31:08.935
Now, it's our new
once-a-day antibiotic

31:08.968 --> 31:12.939
with excellent coverage
for bronchitis and otitis media.

31:12.939 --> 31:17.276
Now, I could put together
some packages for you
to take to the Congo.

31:17.309 --> 31:20.012
I've heard
that's a pet project of yours.

31:20.046 --> 31:21.580
Quinamax would be wonderful

31:21.613 --> 31:24.383
for all the important work
you're doing over there.

31:24.416 --> 31:27.586
You want me to take
your overpriced
antibiotic to Africa?

31:27.619 --> 31:30.957
It has great coverage for
pneumococcus and H. flu.

31:30.957 --> 31:33.960
Why hasn't there been a new drug
for malaria in three decades?

31:33.993 --> 31:35.527
That's a really good question.

31:35.561 --> 31:38.030
Because there's no profit
in treating poor people.

31:38.064 --> 31:39.465
My company...

31:39.498 --> 31:41.633
Your company spends
twice as much in marketing

31:41.667 --> 31:43.169
as it does in development,

31:43.202 --> 31:45.704
which is why prescription drug
costs have tripled

31:45.737 --> 31:47.573
in the last ten years.

31:49.475 --> 31:51.177
Get out of here.
I want you out of here.

31:51.210 --> 31:52.644
You know, if this
is a bad time...

31:52.678 --> 31:54.380
Frank, I'm going to go get
some coffee.

31:54.413 --> 31:55.414
Page me if you need me.

31:55.447 --> 32:00.652
Okay, Dr. Kovac, if you could...

32:00.686 --> 32:03.222
You know,
I'll just come back

32:03.255 --> 32:05.457
when you're not so busy.

32:07.059 --> 32:08.260
Everything looks good.

32:08.294 --> 32:11.263
Don't sound
so surprised.

32:11.297 --> 32:13.099
Ben, I really appreciate
the gesture,

32:13.132 --> 32:15.067
but I can't accept this.

32:15.101 --> 32:17.336
Well, you said
you liked it.

32:17.369 --> 32:20.706
I do, but that book
is worth a lot of money.

32:20.739 --> 32:24.043
No, no, my first edition Brontes
are worth a lot of money.

32:25.744 --> 32:31.450
I just think
it's... inappropriate.

32:31.483 --> 32:32.284
I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

32:32.318 --> 32:33.152
No, you didn't.

32:33.185 --> 32:34.320
It's just that

32:34.353 --> 32:35.487
you've done
a lot for me,

32:35.521 --> 32:36.588
and you know,
I just wanted

32:36.622 --> 32:38.490
to show my
appreciation.

32:38.524 --> 32:42.528
I certainly never meant to
make you feel uncomfortable.

32:42.561 --> 32:45.097
No, no, you didn't
make me feel uncomf...

32:45.131 --> 32:46.165
It's no big deal.

32:46.198 --> 32:47.033
I can help you
get a ride home

32:47.066 --> 32:48.234
if you can wait a while.

32:48.267 --> 32:49.768
You know, I'll
grab a cab.

32:49.801 --> 32:52.238
Okay, same time next week
for another level.

32:52.271 --> 32:54.140
Thank you for the flowers.

32:57.376 --> 32:59.778
I feel officially lousy.

32:59.811 --> 33:02.414
So, is it "Jing-My"
or "Jing-May"?

33:02.448 --> 33:05.451
I'm getting conflicting
information.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.253
Call me Deb.

33:07.286 --> 33:08.787
Okay. What are you doing
after this, Deb?

33:08.820 --> 33:10.056
You want to grab a beer,
shoot a little pool?

33:10.089 --> 33:11.457
I can't.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.059
I'm taking my parents
to the airport.

33:13.059 --> 33:14.726
We can go out
after we drop them off.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.795
You'll drive my
mother and father
to the airport?

33:16.828 --> 33:18.797
Sure. It'll be good
for some embarrassing
childhood stories.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.532
No, not my parents.

33:20.566 --> 33:22.768
They're a little distant,
bordering on xenophobic.

33:22.801 --> 33:25.371
My dad has six toes.
Just on one foot.

33:25.404 --> 33:27.073
Has anyone seen Alex?

33:27.106 --> 33:29.241
Yeah, he was hanging
around here earlier.

33:29.275 --> 33:31.677
Could you find him
for me, please?

33:39.151 --> 33:41.787
You should use your fireball.

33:43.255 --> 33:45.624
This your first time playing?

33:45.657 --> 33:48.660
Nope.

33:48.694 --> 33:51.497
You want me to show you
how to do the dragon punch?

33:51.530 --> 33:54.366
Nope.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.802
He's going to kill you
with his psychocrusher move.

33:59.438 --> 34:03.575
Told you.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.179
I'm thirsty.

34:07.213 --> 34:08.447
That's a good sign.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.315
Can she have some ice chips?

34:10.349 --> 34:12.318
Let's hold off
for a little while.

34:14.652 --> 34:16.822
You lost a lot of blood
in your delivery.

34:16.855 --> 34:18.389
We had to give you
a transfusion,

34:18.424 --> 34:20.726
but the bleeding's
stopped now.

34:20.759 --> 34:22.527
You're going to be fine.

34:22.561 --> 34:24.663
And we're taking your baby
up to the NICU.

34:24.696 --> 34:27.699
Good.

34:27.733 --> 34:30.136
He's doing better.

34:30.136 --> 34:31.303
Just take him away.

34:31.337 --> 34:34.239
Denny, just...
Please.

34:52.757 --> 34:54.226
Has Abby shown up yet?

34:54.260 --> 34:54.793
OR Four.

34:54.826 --> 34:57.263
Doing what?

34:59.231 --> 35:01.167
I was paging you.

35:01.167 --> 35:03.235
I was with this patient.

35:03.269 --> 35:05.637
So I hear.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.642
( sighing )

35:10.676 --> 35:14.213
You convinced the family
to donate his organs?

35:14.246 --> 35:15.447
Spending this much time
with a patient

35:15.481 --> 35:17.916
is a luxury
we don't usually have.

35:17.949 --> 35:21.653
You missed out on
an interesting volvulus repair.

35:21.687 --> 35:25.224
Well, I just felt like
his wife needed me.

35:25.257 --> 35:26.925
You already
do this well, Abby.

35:26.958 --> 35:28.894
Sometimes being a doctor

35:28.927 --> 35:32.798
is about distancing yourself
from your patient.

35:37.269 --> 35:38.604
You don't have to stay.

35:38.637 --> 35:40.806
I'd like to stick around
if that's okay.

35:43.842 --> 35:45.477
( door closes )

35:45.511 --> 35:46.445
( sighing )

35:46.478 --> 35:47.946
What the hell is this?

35:47.979 --> 35:49.715
A Labrador retriever.

35:49.748 --> 35:50.816
Wrong answer.

35:50.849 --> 35:52.484
Some sort of spaniel--
a terrier?

35:52.518 --> 35:53.785
Who brought it
into the hospital?

35:53.819 --> 35:54.953
Was it Pratt?

35:54.986 --> 35:56.355
I'm sorry,
Dr. Romano.

35:56.388 --> 35:58.924
I did.
She belongs to me.

35:58.957 --> 35:59.925
This isn't
a petting zoo.

35:59.958 --> 36:01.460
She's not a pet.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.262
She's a seeing-eye dog,
aren't you?

36:03.295 --> 36:05.597
Oh, how could you hate
a face this cute?

36:05.631 --> 36:07.766
All right, come on.
Let's go home. Bye.

36:07.799 --> 36:08.934
So, where is my son?

36:08.967 --> 36:10.636
Did you tell him
where the morgue is?

36:10.669 --> 36:12.904
I couldn't find him.

36:12.938 --> 36:16.308
He's across the street
in the new Jumbo Mart.

36:19.311 --> 36:20.579
Got you now.

36:20.612 --> 36:21.913
That's cheating.

36:21.947 --> 36:23.849
I thought you were
good at this game.

36:23.882 --> 36:26.518
SAM:
What the hell are you doing?

36:26.552 --> 36:28.454
My shift ended
an hour ago. Why?

36:28.487 --> 36:29.855
I'm not talking to you.

36:29.888 --> 36:31.423
You cannot
just wander off

36:31.457 --> 36:33.759
without telling me
where you're going.

36:33.792 --> 36:37.396
Did you eat all this?

36:37.429 --> 36:38.864
Where did you
get the money?

36:38.897 --> 36:41.667
He bought it for me.

36:41.700 --> 36:42.801
Do you know
what time it is?

36:42.834 --> 36:46.338
Did you take
your shot? No?

36:46.372 --> 36:47.673
Look at him.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.508
He's hyperglycemic
and ketotic.

36:49.541 --> 36:52.778
Did you not notice anything
strange about his behavior?

36:52.811 --> 36:53.912
He's diabetic.

36:53.945 --> 36:55.281
God, I can smell
it from here.

36:55.281 --> 36:56.815
I thought
he was a street kid.

36:56.848 --> 36:58.617
I didn't know
he was your patient.

36:58.650 --> 36:59.951
He's my son.

37:08.927 --> 37:11.297
Hi. Sorry to bother you.

37:11.297 --> 37:13.399
A-Are you stalking me?

37:23.074 --> 37:25.344
I've got his first x-ray.

37:25.377 --> 37:27.846
His heart and lungs
look good.

37:27.879 --> 37:29.681
He's fighting.

37:29.715 --> 37:31.317
I told you.

37:31.350 --> 37:33.051
Look, Denny, maybe you should
get off your feet for...

37:33.084 --> 37:36.021
I'm just want to stay
here a little while.

37:38.557 --> 37:41.793
He shouldn't
have to die alone.

37:44.763 --> 37:46.432
Was this a bad idea?

37:46.465 --> 37:49.335
Oh, no, no,
I love, I love dogs.

37:49.368 --> 37:51.337
I-I grew up with dogs.

37:51.370 --> 37:55.841
My parents had a cattle farm
outside of Gary.

37:55.874 --> 37:58.377
So, you were a farm boy?

37:58.410 --> 38:01.347
I still would be
if my mother hadn't insisted

38:01.380 --> 38:02.714
on my going to college.

38:02.748 --> 38:05.484
What about your parents?

38:05.517 --> 38:07.586
Want to hold her?
Oh, yeah.

38:07.619 --> 38:10.689
My mom is a secretary.

38:10.722 --> 38:12.991
Was a secretary.

38:13.024 --> 38:14.493
She wanted me to be
a flight attendant.

38:14.526 --> 38:15.694
Really?

38:15.727 --> 38:17.496
Yeah, that
wasn't happening.

38:17.529 --> 38:19.598
She, uh, died
a few years ago.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.700
Oh, I'm, I'm sorry.

38:23.101 --> 38:25.036
What about
your father?

38:25.070 --> 38:26.905
He's still in Chicago.

38:26.938 --> 38:28.740
He's a test pilot
for Barcalounger.

38:28.774 --> 38:33.645
He must be pretty proud of you.

38:33.679 --> 38:35.914
You're, uh,
you're not close?

38:35.947 --> 38:37.849
Not really.

38:39.885 --> 38:41.553
That's a shame.

38:41.587 --> 38:42.754
Yeah.

38:42.788 --> 38:45.424
It, uh, it happens.

38:45.457 --> 38:49.094
I have a daughter
named, named Karen.

38:49.127 --> 38:50.629
Yeah?

38:50.662 --> 38:51.997
Yeah, I haven't...

38:52.030 --> 38:54.500
I haven't talked
to her in years.

38:54.533 --> 38:56.402
You should try to reconnect.

38:56.435 --> 38:58.604
No, it's not,
not going to happen.

38:58.637 --> 38:59.738
You should call her.

38:59.771 --> 39:03.909
No, she, uh,
she blames me for things

39:03.942 --> 39:07.979
when... when my wife died.

39:08.013 --> 39:10.549
I didn't see that
coming, either.

39:10.582 --> 39:12.984
Your wife died suddenly?

39:13.018 --> 39:14.653
No, no, not really.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.422
She, she had cancer.

39:16.422 --> 39:18.089
She fought it
for a long time,

39:18.123 --> 39:22.728
but we both knew she wasn't...
she wasn't going to beat it.

39:22.761 --> 39:26.064
Still, I just,
I never expected it

39:26.097 --> 39:28.600
to end that way, you know.

39:28.634 --> 39:32.471
I just had trouble...
I had a hard time

39:32.504 --> 39:36.742
accepting the...
finality of it, of it all.

39:36.775 --> 39:41.780
Yeah.

39:41.813 --> 39:43.181
340.

39:43.214 --> 39:44.850
I didn't know
he had diabetes.

39:44.883 --> 39:46.084
He's a kid.
You're an adult.

39:46.117 --> 39:48.787
You're supposed
to be a doctor.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.522
You didn't notice
he was acting weird?

39:50.556 --> 39:51.890
Lots of kids
his age are weird.

39:51.923 --> 39:52.924
What are you doing
playing video games

39:52.958 --> 39:54.660
with a nine-year-old,
anyway?

39:54.693 --> 39:58.497
You gave him ice cream, candy...
What's up with that?

40:00.198 --> 40:01.667
Can I discharge
Mrs. Fionelli?

40:01.700 --> 40:03.469
Find another attending.
I'm off.

40:03.502 --> 40:05.971
Oh, all right.

40:06.004 --> 40:07.539
Her pelvic sonogram
results came back.

40:07.573 --> 40:09.074
She's got an
ovarian cyst,

40:09.107 --> 40:11.510
so I was just going to put
her on a non-steroidal.

40:11.543 --> 40:13.545
She had
an abdominal CT scan?

40:13.579 --> 40:15.914
We were thinking
diverticulitis.

40:15.947 --> 40:16.615
Flip over your chart.

40:16.648 --> 40:17.583
What?

40:17.616 --> 40:18.884
On the back
of your chart,

40:18.917 --> 40:20.952
there's a price list
of all tests and labs.

40:20.986 --> 40:23.522
You ordered a CBC--
that's what?

40:23.555 --> 40:24.656
$140.

40:24.690 --> 40:26.057
A chem panel and UA?

40:26.091 --> 40:27.859
$350 and $90.

40:27.893 --> 40:29.227
What else?

40:29.260 --> 40:31.229
GC and chlamydia
cultures-- $300.

40:31.262 --> 40:34.966
IV start and a liter
of saline-- at least $200.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.835
Morphine's another $50.

40:36.868 --> 40:39.671
Abdomen and pelvic CT,
$3,000 easy.

40:39.705 --> 40:41.106
Did I miss anything?

40:41.139 --> 40:45.511
Pelvic ultrasound--
$750.

40:45.544 --> 40:48.013
$4,880.

40:48.046 --> 40:50.949
You could have done
a negative urine ICON

40:50.982 --> 40:53.151
to rule out ectopic
for 15 bucks,

40:53.184 --> 40:55.120
performed
a thorough physical exam

40:55.153 --> 40:57.255
and treated her
with a $2 dose of ibuprofen.

40:57.288 --> 40:59.124
And this is why
we can't provide

40:59.157 --> 41:00.258
health care
for everyone.

41:00.291 --> 41:01.793
Hey, where's Logan?

41:01.827 --> 41:03.228
Rule out subarachnoid?

41:03.261 --> 41:05.063
She was in Curtain Two.

41:05.096 --> 41:06.632
Dr. Kovac discharged her.

41:06.665 --> 41:08.600
Oh, Neurology
finally came down?

41:08.634 --> 41:11.002
Nope. I did an LP
about four hours ago.

41:11.036 --> 41:12.137
You did what?

41:12.170 --> 41:14.105
She'd been waiting all day.

41:14.139 --> 41:15.641
Her fluid was clear--

41:15.674 --> 41:18.810
no blood, no xanthochromia,
no subarachnoid.

41:18.844 --> 41:20.011
A spinal tap is the quickest

41:20.045 --> 41:21.212
and easiest way
to rule out an SAH,

41:21.246 --> 41:22.213
and it's 100% sensitive.

41:22.247 --> 41:23.815
She was my patient.

41:23.849 --> 41:25.283
Yes,

41:25.316 --> 41:27.185
and if I hadn't treated her,
she'd still be here.

41:27.218 --> 41:28.554
Now she's at home
and feeling better.

41:28.587 --> 41:29.855
Oh, so, that's it?

41:29.888 --> 41:30.956
This is how
I'm supposed to learn?

41:30.989 --> 41:32.090
Either I do it your way,

41:32.123 --> 41:33.224
or you take it
away from me?

41:33.258 --> 41:34.893
Pratt,
I'm trying to teach you

41:34.926 --> 41:37.195
that the way you practice
medicine here is inefficient.

41:37.228 --> 41:39.698
Oh, and letting babies die is?

41:42.333 --> 41:44.636
You really think you
saved that kid today?

41:44.670 --> 41:45.704
For what--

41:45.737 --> 41:46.838
24-hour nursing care?

41:46.872 --> 41:47.973
He's going to
probably require

41:48.006 --> 41:49.575
a lifetime
of commitment.

41:49.608 --> 41:51.309
Are you going to be around
to give it to him?

41:51.342 --> 41:53.244
Listen, I'm sorry
I'm not in some mud hut

41:53.278 --> 41:55.246
doing amputations
with a pocketknife.

41:55.280 --> 41:56.815
We have the technology
and the expertise

41:56.848 --> 41:58.316
to give that kid
a chance.

41:58.349 --> 42:00.952
What's the sense of having it
if we don't use it?

42:00.986 --> 42:02.821
That kid has about a
five percent chance

42:02.854 --> 42:04.022
of having a normal life.

42:04.055 --> 42:05.724
Do you have any idea
how many other kids

42:05.757 --> 42:07.593
we could have treated
with those resources?

42:07.626 --> 42:09.260
I do everything that I can
for my patients.

42:09.294 --> 42:10.862
That's how I practice medicine.

42:10.896 --> 42:13.331
This is Chicago,
not the damn Congo.

42:13.364 --> 42:16.267
Maybe you should
just go back to Africa.

42:16.301 --> 42:18.770
Maybe you should go to Africa.

42:18.804 --> 42:21.206
I know you didn't
just say that to me.

42:21.239 --> 42:23.775
Maybe then you'd learn
there's more to being a doctor

42:23.809 --> 42:25.677
than ordering tests
and calling consults

42:25.711 --> 42:27.679
for every patient
just to cover your ass.

42:27.713 --> 42:29.848
Stay away from my patients.

42:29.881 --> 42:32.718
From now on I'll present
to another attending.

42:37.856 --> 42:39.825
You can just take
big bites, you know.

42:39.858 --> 42:41.627
The mortician will
do what he can.

42:41.660 --> 42:43.261
I need the practice.

42:43.294 --> 42:44.329
All right, well,
take your time.

42:44.362 --> 42:46.932
He's not going anywhere.

42:58.376 --> 43:01.312
PATRICIA:
What all will they take?

43:01.346 --> 43:03.148
LOCKHART:
His kidneys,

43:03.181 --> 43:06.384
which would go to two people
with end-stage renal disease,

43:06.417 --> 43:09.354
and that would free them
from a lifetime of dialysis.

43:09.387 --> 43:13.892
His heart and lungs could go
to as many as three people

43:13.925 --> 43:16.828
with cardiac
and pulmonary disease.

43:16.862 --> 43:19.931
His pancreas and intestines
would go

43:19.965 --> 43:22.668
to children as
well as adults.

43:22.668 --> 43:24.002
His corneas

43:24.035 --> 43:26.772
would allow two people
to see again.

43:26.805 --> 43:29.107
His skin, bones
and other tissue

43:29.140 --> 43:32.343
will help treat burn victims.

43:32.377 --> 43:35.380
And his liver will be split
into multiple transplants

43:35.413 --> 43:40.385
and used for children with birth
defects that used to be fatal.
