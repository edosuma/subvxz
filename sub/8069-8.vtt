01:03.864 --> 01:05.366
Well, make it fast.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.901
I want to take a bath.

01:07.935 --> 01:08.802
Forget it.

01:08.836 --> 01:10.238
It's occupied.

01:10.271 --> 01:12.706
I need to replace
a couple washers.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.475
Dan, this has been the
hardest week of my life.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.076
I'd like to take a bath.

01:16.110 --> 01:19.113
Two washers, two minutes tops.

01:19.147 --> 01:21.815
What's wrong with
using your bathroom?

01:21.849 --> 01:23.551
I can't use my bathroom.

01:23.584 --> 01:27.521
My bathroom has been
taken over by Becky.

01:27.555 --> 01:30.924
Maybe I should come
back Mrs. Conner.

01:30.958 --> 01:32.526
Go ahead and do it now.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.228
Soon as you're done,
I'm going in there.

01:34.262 --> 01:37.165
And I'm putting up the
do-not-disturb sign.

01:37.198 --> 01:40.134
Which means if the doorbell
rings, you answer it.

01:40.168 --> 01:42.770
And if the phone rings,
you take a message.

01:42.803 --> 01:45.673
And if the house burns
down, you get the kids out.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.418
Have that burned.

02:30.451 --> 02:31.252
Yes, madam.

just as you like it.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.327
Thanks fellas.

02:44.532 --> 02:49.603
Oh look, a sink with a
stopper that actually works.

02:49.637 --> 02:53.541
And you can cool it
with that madam stuff.

Name's Roseanne.

03:00.314 --> 03:02.883
Oh, not now, Zeke.

Hi, sis.

03:05.653 --> 03:07.688
Jackie, what are you doing?

03:07.721 --> 03:08.956
Just soaking.

03:08.989 --> 03:11.459
This tub is terrific, Roseanne.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.794
Do I have to share
everything with you?

03:13.827 --> 03:14.762
No, I'm done.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.364
It's all yours.

03:16.397 --> 03:18.632
Thanks, boys.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.801
I wanted a fresh bath!

03:20.834 --> 03:22.069
That's Jackie water.

03:22.102 --> 03:25.138
Roseanne, we can
refill it in no time.

03:25.172 --> 03:26.940
How about a pedicure
while you wait?

03:26.974 --> 03:29.343
Oh, all right.

03:29.377 --> 03:30.844
I see you worked at Wellman.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.179
11 years.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.482
Oh, you poor thing.

You try and relax
with three kids.

Well, two.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.565
And why ain't you in school?

04:24.598 --> 04:27.100
I didn't like the curriculum.

04:27.134 --> 04:28.769
Take her over and
strap her in that desk.

04:31.605 --> 04:35.175
I told you about disturbing
me when I am trying to relax.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.644
Watch it, studs.

04:36.677 --> 04:40.781

it's death by pop quiz.

I'm getting a headache.

I came in here to relax.

05:37.270 --> 05:39.172
I'll be done in 20 minutes.

Look what you have done
to my very best bath towels!

05:41.742 --> 05:42.610
So?

05:42.643 --> 05:43.744
You can wash 'em.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.446
I'm bleaching a pair
of jeans in the tub?

05:45.479 --> 05:46.346
What?

It won't take long.

tonight with Jimmy.

Jimmy would think if he

happened to show up
here early and catch

corn I smell.

considered using propane?

07:23.844 --> 07:25.112
We like coals.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.280
Yeah, but propane is a lot
cleaner burning fuel so--

08:17.464 --> 08:18.498
I borrowed them.

08:18.532 --> 08:19.933
Anything you say is
usually sarcastic

08:19.967 --> 08:21.134
and will be used against you.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.803
Well, am I ever
going to get them back?

08:22.836 --> 08:24.705
No, and since you
can't afford an attorney

08:24.738 --> 08:29.309
because you quit your job
one will be provided for you.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.278
Well, you know I'm
not a bracelet person.

08:31.311 --> 08:32.546
Now, can't you take these off?

08:32.580 --> 08:34.114
You kill four
people, Roseanne.

08:34.147 --> 08:35.683
Oh, that's just like you.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.918
That is just like you to throw
that out to me, isn't it?

08:37.951 --> 08:39.753
So, when is my trial?

08:39.787 --> 08:42.723
Right now.

prosecution would like

08:46.960 --> 08:51.632
to begin by calling its first
witness, Mrs. Darlene Conner.

08:51.665 --> 08:52.966
Objection!

08:53.000 --> 08:55.603
You can't call somebody up
there that I already murdered.

Allegedly
murdered, your Honor.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.140
Objection overruled.

You may continue.

Mrs. Conner, do
you swear to tell

09:02.643 --> 09:04.645
the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

09:05.746 --> 09:07.881
Yeah right.

Hi, Pumpkin.

Am I in trouble?

09:11.852 --> 09:13.987
No you're not.

09:14.021 --> 09:16.323
No you're not.

09:16.356 --> 09:20.027
All I need for you to do, is
to tell these nice people over

09:20.060 --> 09:26.634
here just what it was that your
mom did to you the other day.

09:26.667 --> 09:27.968
She murdered me.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.905

09:31.939 --> 09:36.009
Mrs. Conner, do you
know the difference

09:36.043 --> 09:40.347
between right and wrong?

09:40.380 --> 09:41.815
Yeah.

09:41.849 --> 09:44.517
Right is when you do something
wrong and you don't get caught.

Wrong is when you do something
wrong and you do get caught.

09:48.355 --> 09:49.790
I move that this
witness be dismissed

grounds that she's a punk.

Bailiff, this
won't be necessary.

I think everyone knows that
Becky always tells the truth.

I just want to say that I
understand what you did, Mom.

10:17.484 --> 10:20.187

punished for it because that's

that your mom killed you.

my mother my pain.

would please the court,

You're never getting near
me again, and I mean it!

11:11.138 --> 11:13.140
That was you,
Becky, you did that.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.541
Your mother was trying
to give you life,

11:14.574 --> 11:18.245
and all you gave her
was excruciating agony.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.913
I apologize, Mom.

11:19.947 --> 11:21.314
And I forgive you.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.116
I forgive you too, Mother.

11:23.150 --> 11:25.953
Sit down or I'll
throw the book at you!

11:25.986 --> 11:28.121
Hey, you know you
shouldn't be throwing books!

11:28.155 --> 11:30.958
There are people in this world
who don't even have books.

11:30.991 --> 11:33.493
Oh, really?

11:33.526 --> 11:35.796
Hey, don't you be
throwing stuff at my kid.

11:35.829 --> 11:38.265
The people would like to
call Ms. Crystal Anderson.

11:38.298 --> 11:39.933
Would you like meatball
or double cheese?

11:39.967 --> 11:41.735
Double cheese.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.403
You look great, Crystal.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.005
Flattery won't
get you anywhere.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.474

11:47.507 --> 11:50.543
Your Honor, Roseanne had
best husband in the world,

11:50.577 --> 11:52.746
and what she did
is unforgivable.

11:52.780 --> 11:55.315
Oh, Crystal, you just
have the hots for Dan.

11:55.348 --> 11:56.349
And you always have.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.118
Let's cut the crap
here, your Honor.

11:58.151 --> 11:59.019
We all know Roseanne.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.420
We all know what she's like.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.823
She's loud, and she's bossy, and
she talks with her mouth full.

12:02.856 --> 12:05.592
She curses at people
when she drives.

12:05.625 --> 12:07.127
She feeds her
children frozen fish

12:07.160 --> 12:08.261

And most important, your Honor,
she's married to the greatest

and strong, and masculine,

12:23.977 --> 12:25.678
and sexy and virile.

12:25.712 --> 12:28.715
And, I mean, when you see him
on a summer day and his hair

12:28.748 --> 12:30.450
is sweaty around the edges.

12:30.483 --> 12:33.153
The rest of it is fluffed
up and golden from the sun.

12:33.186 --> 12:35.388
And his shirt is clingin'
to him from his sweat

12:35.422 --> 12:38.258
because he's been
workin' so hard.

12:38.291 --> 12:42.329
Well, he's about the
sexiest man I've ever seen.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.231
No further
questions, your Honor.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.433

Your Honor, I say
hang the bitch!

You know, Crystal,
the only reason

12:51.805 --> 12:53.206
I am even your
friend at all is just

12:53.240 --> 12:55.442
because I feel sorry for you.

12:55.475 --> 12:58.078
You had three men in your
life and you lost them all.

12:58.111 --> 13:01.248
And I have been
telling you, sometimes

13:01.281 --> 13:02.482
the only way you
can keep a man happy

13:02.515 --> 13:04.151
is to treat him like
dirt once in a while.

13:04.184 --> 13:06.753
Men do not like wimpy

You're darn right I'm right.

13:10.523 --> 13:11.859
You know, Crystal,
the only reason

13:11.892 --> 13:13.861
I say all those awful,
hurtful things to you

13:13.894 --> 13:16.296
is the same reason I

It's out of love!

13:18.331 --> 13:19.732

I'm glad that you girls have
settled your differences,

13:22.335 --> 13:25.538
but we still have four
counts of murder here.

13:25.572 --> 13:29.009
Do you realize the
seriousness of this charge?

13:29.042 --> 13:32.045
You could get from
25 years to life.

13:32.079 --> 13:35.715
I got 25 years to
life when I married him.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.985
Wise cracks won't
save you this time.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.520
It wasn't a wise crack.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.789
I wanted 25 years to life.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.158
That's why I married him.

13:45.192 --> 13:46.894
I love him.

If you loved him, why did
you kill him and your three

was ten minutes alone

Your Honor, in light of the

How do I feel about Roseanne?

Frequently I'm nuts
about this lady.

Frequently I'm

with her complaining-- what's

Let her find another man.

I know how I feel.
