[soft rustling outside]

[woman breathing heavily]

01:19.383 --> 01:21.255
- Hah!
- [shrieks] Oh, my...

01:21.298 --> 01:22.560
- Carter.
- [Carter laughing]

01:22.604 --> 01:24.258
Oh.

01:24.301 --> 01:25.520
Oh, I got home from work early.

01:25.563 --> 01:26.912
Huh, did I scare you?

01:26.956 --> 01:27.870
[Carter chuckles]

01:28.871 --> 01:30.046
No.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.440
You scaredy-cat.

01:32.483 --> 01:34.006
How's dinner? Is it done?

01:34.050 --> 01:36.966
- Almost.
- I'm starving. Let's go.

01:37.009 --> 01:38.750
[Carter chuckles] It's okay.

01:40.535 --> 01:41.971
Baby, you've got something
all over your face.

01:42.014 --> 01:44.104
And that was so worth it.

01:44.147 --> 01:45.366
- I do?
- [chuckles] Yeah.

01:45.409 --> 01:46.454
Did I, did I get it?

01:46.497 --> 01:48.151
Ah, ah, that's good enough.

01:48.195 --> 01:49.544
Okay.

01:49.587 --> 01:50.632
[Carter sighs]

01:50.675 --> 01:52.982
Wow. What's the occasion?

01:55.506 --> 01:56.681
Happy Anniversary.

01:57.595 --> 01:59.336
I'm kidding.

01:59.380 --> 02:01.295
[chuckles] Happy Anniversary.

02:08.824 --> 02:10.608
Did you really think I forgot?

02:11.957 --> 02:14.046
I don't know.

02:14.090 --> 02:16.788
Well, why don't you, uh,
close your eyes?

02:22.446 --> 02:24.187
- [chuckles softly]
- [Carter chuckles]

02:24.231 --> 02:25.971
Now stick out your hand.

02:26.015 --> 02:26.972
Okay.

02:29.627 --> 02:30.715
- Open it.
- Oh.

02:32.021 --> 02:35.590
It's a... Oh, it's...

02:35.633 --> 02:36.591
a rock.

02:39.071 --> 02:40.812
It's a tiny piece of the Alps.

02:42.901 --> 02:45.600
I'm gonna take you there
on a trip next month, or...

02:45.643 --> 02:47.471
whenever, but there's this
incredible climb, it's...

02:48.907 --> 02:51.214
Why does your face
look like that?

02:51.258 --> 02:52.911
- I...
- What?

02:52.955 --> 02:54.565
- I-I...
- What?

02:57.133 --> 02:59.048
I thought you were going to
propose.

03:01.050 --> 03:02.225
Mel...

03:03.139 --> 03:04.096
[sighs]

03:06.316 --> 03:07.578
Five years, Carter.

03:07.622 --> 03:08.536
[Carter exhales sharply]

03:09.841 --> 03:11.234
Five years we've been together,

03:11.278 --> 03:15.369
and you don't even know
that I hate hikes.

03:15.412 --> 03:17.022
I thought it would be fun.

03:18.546 --> 03:20.504
Geez, Mel, you used to
run marathons.

03:20.548 --> 03:22.419
I used to dream I'd be able
to keep up with you,

03:22.463 --> 03:24.247
and now it's like... [scoffs]

03:25.205 --> 03:26.423
What?

03:26.467 --> 03:27.729
I'm bored.

03:29.034 --> 03:30.949
- Oh.
- You're bored?

03:32.299 --> 03:34.997
No, no, we're...

03:35.040 --> 03:37.391
- We're happy.
- We're not happy.

03:37.434 --> 03:39.044
Oh, my...

03:39.088 --> 03:42.744
Mel... Okay, you-you once
blindfolded me

03:42.787 --> 03:45.268
and drove to San Francisco
for dinner,

03:45.312 --> 03:48.271
and now you are literally
making a roast.

03:48.315 --> 03:50.142
I, I...

03:51.796 --> 03:53.145
For you.

03:54.059 --> 03:56.410
For you.

03:56.453 --> 03:58.760
I have supported you
for five years.

03:58.803 --> 04:01.328
Our entire relationship
has always been defined

04:01.371 --> 04:03.199
by what youwant.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.635
What do you want, Mel?

04:04.679 --> 04:06.898
I want to...

04:06.942 --> 04:09.292
stop living in limbo.

04:09.336 --> 04:12.687
And if I seem lost to you
from what I was,

04:12.730 --> 04:15.298
well, maybe that's because
you've nevergiven me

04:15.342 --> 04:17.909
any indication
that this is going anywhere.

04:19.911 --> 04:21.261
Maybe you're right.

04:23.001 --> 04:25.090
Maybe this isn't going anywhere.

04:25.656 --> 04:26.614
No.

04:28.616 --> 04:29.704
What?

04:29.747 --> 04:32.054
Mel, I-I-I can't do this.

04:35.144 --> 04:37.451
And before you start feeling
sorry for yourself,

04:37.494 --> 04:40.410
I want you to know that
you are hurting me, by the way.

04:40.454 --> 04:42.586
- Is that a fact?
- Yes.

04:43.935 --> 04:44.893
I still love you.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.332
What's my favorite color?

04:49.941 --> 04:50.942
Oh.

04:53.380 --> 04:54.294
Blue.

04:55.947 --> 04:56.905
Get out.

05:03.825 --> 05:05.130
Oh.

05:05.174 --> 05:07.829
[soft instrumental music]

05:10.527 --> 05:11.920

[birds chirping]

05:33.681 --> 05:36.423
[soft instrumental music]

05:52.395 --> 05:54.397
- [woman] It's been a week.
- [Mel moans]

05:54.441 --> 05:55.703
[sighs]

05:55.746 --> 05:58.053
Oh...

05:58.096 --> 06:00.882
[Mel groans] Well, according to
Cosmo'sbreak-up calendar,

06:00.925 --> 06:03.232
this can take as long as
two and a half years, so...

06:03.275 --> 06:05.408
Mmm. Well, I don't have
two and a half years.

06:05.452 --> 06:08.498
So, I don't care what Cosmo's
break-up calculator says.

06:08.542 --> 06:10.457
This is vile. Wow.

06:10.500 --> 06:13.373
Well, it's good for you,
so suck it up.

06:13.416 --> 06:16.071
Aww. You look so pretty
in this photo.

06:16.114 --> 06:17.986
- Leslie...
- You look pretty in every photo.

06:18.029 --> 06:19.944
Thanks.

06:19.988 --> 06:22.425
But so do you. I mean, you look
amazing in these photos

06:22.469 --> 06:26.168
so beautiful, you're strong,
purposeful.

06:28.475 --> 06:29.911
Carter was dead weight.

06:30.999 --> 06:32.696
I know.

06:32.740 --> 06:34.698
Youget to decide
who you wanna be

06:34.742 --> 06:37.397
not him, not anybody else, okay?

06:37.440 --> 06:40.138
I know. I know,
but he was right, though.

06:40.182 --> 06:42.314
He was. I've just...

06:42.358 --> 06:44.491
I've become so small.

06:44.534 --> 06:47.145
It's like I don't even know
who I am anymore, who I was.

06:47.189 --> 06:49.626
Okay, well, who you were
was not perfect

06:49.670 --> 06:53.282
but she wasn't, you know,
drinking wine at 4:00 p.m.,

06:53.325 --> 06:55.110
house-hunting down memory lane.

06:57.068 --> 06:58.983
Ohhh. Okay, fine.

06:59.027 --> 07:02.030
I will indulge you
for one minute.

07:03.248 --> 07:05.468
You look gorgeous in this photo.

07:05.512 --> 07:07.557
Hmm.

07:07.601 --> 07:09.429
- Who took that?
- Wasn't me.

07:09.472 --> 07:11.126
It's probably
one of the thousandsof guys

07:11.169 --> 07:12.910
who are madly in love with you.

07:12.954 --> 07:15.783
- R... Yeah, please.
- [chuckling]

07:15.826 --> 07:17.306
All right, listen,
you beautiful sad sack.

07:17.349 --> 07:18.786
[Leslie] Here's what
we're gonna do.

07:18.829 --> 07:20.483
You are gonna get off the couch,

07:20.527 --> 07:22.311
you're gonna put away
those scrap books,

07:22.354 --> 07:24.835
you're gonna stop listening
to Boonie Bears' early work,

07:24.879 --> 07:27.229
and you're gonna come
to the gym with me.

07:27.272 --> 07:28.970
No, I hate the gym.

07:29.013 --> 07:30.754
You're a track and field
record holder,

07:30.798 --> 07:32.582
you do not hate the gym.

07:32.626 --> 07:35.411
Yeah, I, that was in college,
and I do hate the gym.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.282
They're like playgrounds
that are not fun.

07:37.326 --> 07:38.762
Well, then, make it fun.

07:38.806 --> 07:41.156
Bring a friend, enter me.

07:43.332 --> 07:44.638
No more wasting time.

07:46.683 --> 07:48.032
No more wasting time.

07:49.033 --> 07:51.035
Cheers. Great.

07:56.127 --> 07:57.781
[overhead techno music playing]

07:57.825 --> 07:59.957
You are going to love
this place.

08:00.001 --> 08:01.176
I sincerely doubt that.

08:01.219 --> 08:03.526
What? It's very exclusive.

08:03.570 --> 08:05.049
Exclusive like expensive?

08:05.093 --> 08:06.834
No, it's like the place to be.

08:06.877 --> 08:08.139
It's where all the rich guys
workout.

08:08.183 --> 08:10.141
Hi. How's it going?

08:10.185 --> 08:11.882
Um, could I please have
one guest pass?

08:11.926 --> 08:12.883
Thanks.

08:15.277 --> 08:16.887
Oh, Amy, I didn't even
recognize you.

08:16.931 --> 08:18.715
Hi. How are the kids?

08:18.759 --> 08:19.847
- [Amy] Great.
- Good.

08:19.890 --> 08:21.631
Oh, you guys changed your logo.

08:21.675 --> 08:22.893
It's so much better
than the last one.

08:22.937 --> 08:25.156
Last one's like
a little... chintzy.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.114
That's cute.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.073
[panting]

08:29.117 --> 08:30.814
[overhead techno music playing]

08:32.207 --> 08:34.034
[Leslie singing indistinctly]

08:36.690 --> 08:38.256
So fun, right?

08:38.299 --> 08:40.041
[Mel breathes heavily]

08:42.217 --> 08:44.872
[continues singing indistinctly]

08:55.099 --> 08:56.666
[Mel] Nope. [grunts softly]

08:59.016 --> 08:59.974
Okay.

09:03.107 --> 09:04.065
[sighing]

09:07.198 --> 09:08.939
[grunts]

09:08.983 --> 09:10.550
[breathing heavily]

09:16.556 --> 09:17.774
[whimpers]

09:19.210 --> 09:21.648
[man] You doing okay, Mel?

09:21.691 --> 09:23.650
Sorry. I didn't mean to
scare you.

09:23.693 --> 09:26.217
How did you know my name?

09:26.261 --> 09:27.697
I, uh, I saw your name
on the guest list

09:27.741 --> 09:29.003
when your friend signed you in.

09:29.046 --> 09:30.482
Oh, right.

09:30.526 --> 09:32.659
- Right.
- I'm Trey.

09:32.702 --> 09:34.574
- I'm one of the trainers here.
- Right. Nice to meet you.

09:34.617 --> 09:36.358
You too.

09:36.401 --> 09:37.489
How you doing? You doing okay?

09:37.533 --> 09:39.100
Yeah.

09:39.143 --> 09:41.319
Yeah, no, I just feel a little
out of my depth.

09:41.363 --> 09:43.278
[Trey chuckles] Look, I remember
my first time here,

09:43.321 --> 09:46.977
I was so nervous, I nearly had
a panic attack.

09:47.021 --> 09:49.545
And, uh, believe me,
you're in...

09:49.589 --> 09:50.851
much better shape than I was.

09:51.895 --> 09:53.680
Thank you.

09:53.723 --> 09:55.595
You're welcome.

09:55.638 --> 09:56.900
Listen, I'd hate for you to have

09:56.944 --> 09:59.250
a bad first impression
of the gym.

09:59.294 --> 10:01.122
Can I offer you a free session?

10:01.165 --> 10:02.514
No strings attached, I promise.

10:02.558 --> 10:03.733
Uh, I don't know.

10:03.777 --> 10:05.126
No pressure.

10:05.169 --> 10:07.563
- Um...
- Why don't you just...

10:07.607 --> 10:10.958
make yourself comfortable and
I'll get you a bottle of water.

10:11.001 --> 10:12.046
[overhead techno music playing]

10:12.089 --> 10:13.351
- Okay.
- Yeah?

10:13.395 --> 10:15.092
- Yeah. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10:18.313 --> 10:19.967
O-M-G.

10:20.010 --> 10:21.664
- Who was that?
- Just a trainer.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.753
He offered me a free session.

10:23.797 --> 10:26.451
Hm? Um, yes.
A thousand times yes.

10:26.495 --> 10:28.323
You should obviously
train with him, and, you know,

10:28.366 --> 10:30.281
sleep with him, get married,
maybe even have his children...

10:30.325 --> 10:31.718
Wait, no-no, no-no-no.

10:31.761 --> 10:32.893
I just got out of
a serious relationship,

10:32.936 --> 10:34.242
like five minutes ago.

10:36.026 --> 10:39.464
Anyway, I don't think
he's attracted to me.

10:39.508 --> 10:43.294
Oh. Oh, okay. Yeah.

10:43.338 --> 10:46.384
Your radar's clearly broken,
so I'm gonna go,

10:46.428 --> 10:48.648
but, uh, you enjoy
your training session.

10:54.784 --> 10:57.178
This is the sparring area.

10:57.221 --> 11:01.051
Excellent cardio, a lot more fun
than the elliptical.

11:01.095 --> 11:02.705
If you don't mind me asking,
what brought you

11:02.749 --> 11:04.751
to the gym in the first place?

11:04.794 --> 11:07.014
My excruciatingly upbeat friend.

11:07.057 --> 11:08.842
- Yeah, I saw her.
- Yeah.

11:08.885 --> 11:11.018
And my stupid ex.

11:11.061 --> 11:12.759
- Oh, exes.
- Yeah.

11:12.802 --> 11:15.239
Okay, so we will definitelybe
using this area.

11:15.283 --> 11:18.460
- [chuckles] Yes.
- Yes.

11:18.503 --> 11:20.331
Come on, lot more to see,
so follow me.

11:22.464 --> 11:23.857
One more. Come on, you got this.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.120
You got this. Stay focused.

11:26.163 --> 11:27.251
[breathing heavily]

11:28.600 --> 11:29.558
Good.

11:30.515 --> 11:31.473
[groans]

11:32.866 --> 11:35.129
- [Mel chuckles]
- Excellent work.

11:35.172 --> 11:37.131
- [sighs]
- Good job.

11:37.174 --> 11:38.132
Thanks.

11:39.611 --> 11:41.744
So, how do you feel?

11:41.788 --> 11:42.789
- Good.
- Good.

11:42.832 --> 11:44.529
Good. Yeah, uh, surprised.

11:44.573 --> 11:47.054
I didn't expect to be signing up
for a gym membership

11:47.097 --> 11:49.317
and definitelynot
personal training.

11:49.360 --> 11:52.102
Well, you will not be
disappointed. I promise.

11:53.408 --> 11:55.540
Thank you for encouraging me.

11:55.584 --> 11:57.412
You're welcome.

11:57.455 --> 11:59.588
Tell you what,
just sign right there.

12:03.461 --> 12:05.333
That's it.

12:05.376 --> 12:06.900
Congratulations, Miss Barrett.

12:06.943 --> 12:08.902
You are officially
a card-carrying gym member.

12:08.945 --> 12:10.033
[chuckles] Yay.

12:10.077 --> 12:11.687
- There you are.
- Oh, hey.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.428
- Hi.
- Don't gloat.

12:13.471 --> 12:16.083
I just signed up
for a personal training package.

12:16.126 --> 12:18.085
- Nice.
- And Trey's my trainer.

12:18.128 --> 12:19.956
Very nice.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.350
People must tell you all
the time that you look familiar.

12:22.393 --> 12:24.787
I did a community charity
counter last year.

12:24.831 --> 12:27.442
- So, that's probably it.
- [Leslie chuckles]

12:27.485 --> 12:29.574
- I'll be googling that later.
- [Mel chuckles]

12:29.618 --> 12:31.751
Uh, tell you what, why don't you
come back in tomorrow morning,

12:31.794 --> 12:34.231
we'll do all your
intro-procedures and stuff.

12:34.275 --> 12:37.757
I promise it's not as scary
as it sounds.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.976
- It was very nice to meet you.
- Leslie.

12:40.020 --> 12:41.673
Yes, that's right.

12:41.717 --> 12:42.979
- Bye.
- 'Kay.

12:43.023 --> 12:44.372
You are so lucky.

12:47.462 --> 12:49.420
I'm just, I'm so proud of you.

12:49.464 --> 12:51.814
It's okay, it's a gym membership
not a Pulitzer.

12:51.858 --> 12:54.251
Yeah, but you did it,
and you're doing something.

12:54.295 --> 12:56.993
You're creating something,
and your new trainer is hot.

12:57.037 --> 12:58.690
[Mel chuckles] Don't be weird.

12:58.734 --> 13:00.780
Well, not noticing
would be weird.

13:00.823 --> 13:02.433
Well, it's a professional thing,

13:02.477 --> 13:05.697
so, if anything,
his vibe will be like a brother.

13:05.741 --> 13:08.178
Yeah, an extremely hot brother
who's not related to you.

13:08.222 --> 13:09.397
[chuckles] Okay.

13:11.486 --> 13:13.488
- Mm.
- In that case...

13:13.531 --> 13:14.750
I think you should date him.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.447
- Do not tempt me.
- [Mel chuckles]

13:26.153 --> 13:27.981
Thank you, Chloe. Excellent.

13:28.024 --> 13:29.373
Go ahead and take your break.

13:47.478 --> 13:49.002
Do you see anything you like?

13:51.569 --> 13:52.614
Absolutely.

13:54.355 --> 13:56.487
Yeah, this is...
It's a nice piece.

13:58.054 --> 13:59.882
Yeah.

13:59.926 --> 14:02.102
- Antonio Gutierrez.
- Hmm.

14:02.145 --> 14:04.669
He's young. Totally bizarre.

14:04.713 --> 14:05.670
A genius.

14:07.150 --> 14:10.284
- It's called "Chrysalis."
- Hmm.

14:10.327 --> 14:12.895
You can see the rough
alternating layers to the paint,

14:12.939 --> 14:15.942
coherence, but the texture's
a bit of a riot.

14:15.985 --> 14:17.508
The artist says
he believes in error

14:17.552 --> 14:19.380
because beauty is not found...

14:19.423 --> 14:22.252
Not in perfection, but
the artistry of imperfection.

14:24.646 --> 14:25.865
You know his work.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.390
Yes.

14:29.433 --> 14:33.568
The artist graduated from
his MFA program a month ago.

14:33.611 --> 14:37.050
You just let me babble on like
I was introducing him to you,

14:37.093 --> 14:38.878
like, you just wandered in
off the street.

14:38.921 --> 14:40.967
I did just wander in
off the street,

14:41.010 --> 14:42.577
but yes, I know his work.

14:42.620 --> 14:45.885
I was just enjoying watching
you do yours.

14:47.669 --> 14:49.584
- [chuckles softly]
- I'm Adam, by the way.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.674
Melissa.

14:52.717 --> 14:54.632
Well, Melissa, pleasure.

14:56.852 --> 14:59.289
Hopefully I'll... see you
around here again?

15:00.334 --> 15:01.988
You can count on it.

15:02.031 --> 15:03.380
I own the gallery.

15:08.342 --> 15:09.691
Don't look so scared.

15:09.734 --> 15:11.649
All this assessment intro stuff

15:11.693 --> 15:13.260
is for you...

15:13.303 --> 15:15.697
to track your results
moving forward, okay?

15:15.740 --> 15:18.178
Let me, uh, get a quick picture.

15:18.221 --> 15:19.179
[chuckles]

15:20.354 --> 15:22.225
[chuckles] Sorry.

15:22.269 --> 15:23.966
It's a, it's a progress photo.

15:24.010 --> 15:27.317
All that before-and-after
nonsense.

15:27.361 --> 15:28.971
You don't have to do it
if you don't want to.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.538
- Are you going to post it?
- No.

15:30.581 --> 15:32.975
No, no, no,
I keep 'em in a photo album,

15:33.019 --> 15:34.977
in a bin in my desk.

15:35.021 --> 15:36.283
No one's ever gonna see them.

15:36.326 --> 15:37.762
Okay?

15:37.806 --> 15:39.242
- Okay.
- Okay.

15:39.286 --> 15:41.027
In two seconds. Ready?

15:42.898 --> 15:44.682
Great.

15:44.726 --> 15:45.727
Easy.

15:45.770 --> 15:47.511
Okay.

15:47.555 --> 15:50.601
So, uh, let's, let's talk about
your fitness goals.

15:50.645 --> 15:52.560
You got one?

15:52.603 --> 15:56.303
Ever since I was a little girl,
I wanted to do...

15:56.346 --> 15:58.914
a pull-up without any help.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.308
- Unassisted?
- Yes, but...

16:01.351 --> 16:04.876
But then where you push yourself
all the way up

16:04.920 --> 16:06.008
so you're completely upright.

16:06.052 --> 16:08.097
Yeah. A muscle-up.

16:08.141 --> 16:09.707
It's a very epic move.

16:09.751 --> 16:11.100
Only one percent of people
are actually

16:11.144 --> 16:12.232
capable of doing that move.

16:12.275 --> 16:14.016
Oh, wow.

16:14.060 --> 16:16.627
- Oh, well.
- Okay? A muscle-up.

16:17.454 --> 16:19.108
I love it.

16:19.152 --> 16:20.457
Okay, so... [slaps hands]

16:20.501 --> 16:22.677
we have the perfect goal,

16:22.720 --> 16:25.071
now we need to set the date.

16:27.029 --> 16:29.075
I recommend six weeks.

16:29.118 --> 16:32.992
It's ambitious, but if you're
willing to commit...

16:34.515 --> 16:35.690
I think we can do it.

16:37.170 --> 16:38.606
Six weeks?

16:39.520 --> 16:41.043
Okay.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.653
Okay, I'm one hundred percent
committed,

16:42.697 --> 16:44.307
whatever it will take
to meet my goal.

16:44.351 --> 16:46.005
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:46.048 --> 16:47.658
Excellent.

16:47.702 --> 16:49.312
I'm excited.

16:49.356 --> 16:50.574
Let's do it.

16:52.881 --> 16:54.622
[overhead techno music playing]

16:57.103 --> 16:59.583
All right, so, the way
this works is that

16:59.627 --> 17:02.195
you are going to do a pull-up
just how you normally would.

17:02.238 --> 17:03.587
[chuckling]

17:03.631 --> 17:05.023
- Just like normal?
- Yes.

17:05.067 --> 17:06.938
- Uh-huh, okay.
- It's been a while?

17:06.982 --> 17:10.290
- Uh, like, ten years.
- Ten years. Good. Okay.

17:10.333 --> 17:13.815
So, the machine is going to help
by supplementing your weight.

17:13.858 --> 17:15.859
- It's going to make it easier.
- Easier?

17:15.904 --> 17:16.948
Yes.

17:16.992 --> 17:18.211
Easier? Okay.

17:18.253 --> 17:19.733
- Are you ready?
- Whoops.

17:19.777 --> 17:20.734
- Yeah.
- You're good.

17:20.778 --> 17:22.693
Let's give it a go.

17:22.737 --> 17:24.565
- [Mel groans]
- That's all right.

17:24.608 --> 17:25.827
- That's supposed to happen.
- That's supposed to happen?

17:25.869 --> 17:26.958
- Yes.
- Okay.

17:27.002 --> 17:28.569
All right, now as you pull up,

17:28.612 --> 17:30.266
your shoulder blades back,
like you're squeezing

17:30.310 --> 17:31.572
a tennis ball right there.
Do you feel that?

17:31.615 --> 17:33.052
- Yeah.
- All right. Go.

17:33.095 --> 17:35.054
- [deep breaths]
- Good.

17:36.577 --> 17:37.795
- [Mel groans]
- Okay, good.

17:37.839 --> 17:39.362
Let's try one more.

17:39.406 --> 17:40.363
- All right?
- Okay.

17:41.625 --> 17:43.366
[grunting]

17:43.410 --> 17:44.367
Good.

17:47.109 --> 17:49.155
That's was a great
first attempt, all right?

17:49.198 --> 17:51.853
You're not gonna be perfect
right out of the gate.

17:51.896 --> 17:53.072
But eventually...

17:55.117 --> 17:57.946
I'll get you on that.

17:57.989 --> 18:00.296
Are you kidding me?
That's a skyscraper.

18:00.340 --> 18:01.602
- Yes, it is.
- Oh!

18:01.645 --> 18:03.473
And believe me, you will do it.

18:04.648 --> 18:06.868
All right? Let's try again.

18:06.911 --> 18:07.825
- Okay.
- Get up there.

18:07.869 --> 18:09.392
Okay.

18:09.436 --> 18:11.046
[Mel grunting] Oh!

18:11.090 --> 18:13.048
- [exhales]
- Freeze.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.398
[whispers] I'm Wonder Woman.

18:15.442 --> 18:17.400
- [grunting]
- Good.

18:17.444 --> 18:18.749
[Trey] So, your goal,

18:18.793 --> 18:20.795
a muscle-up is basically
two parts.

18:20.838 --> 18:22.884
First part,
the pull-ups we just did.

18:22.927 --> 18:25.104
It's your biceps, your lats,
your trapezius,

18:25.147 --> 18:26.148
everything else.

18:26.192 --> 18:27.932
Second part, mainly triceps,

18:27.976 --> 18:31.022
which dips are the perfect
exercise for that.

18:31.066 --> 18:32.981
- Set your water down.
- Okay.

18:33.024 --> 18:34.939
- And let's go to town.
- Okay.

18:35.897 --> 18:38.378
Uh... There we go.

18:38.421 --> 18:40.902
- All right. Go for it.
- [deep breaths]

18:40.945 --> 18:42.295
Good. Good.

18:42.338 --> 18:43.339
Okay, you straighten your arms,

18:43.383 --> 18:45.298
shoulders forward, chin down.

18:47.213 --> 18:49.650
- [deep breaths]
- Good. Can you do one more?

18:49.693 --> 18:52.392
- [Mel chuckles] Yes.
- Yes.

18:52.435 --> 18:53.393
[Trey] Good.

18:55.569 --> 18:57.092
Good.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.093
Breathe.

18:59.877 --> 19:02.184
Excellent work, my girl.

19:02.228 --> 19:04.491
Because you've done
such a tremendous job,

19:04.534 --> 19:05.840
I got you something.

19:09.931 --> 19:11.759
It's a fitness track.

19:11.802 --> 19:13.195
[chuckles]

19:13.239 --> 19:15.893
- Wow.
- Can I have your hand?

19:15.937 --> 19:18.069
That's, that's amazing, but I...

19:18.113 --> 19:20.855
Don't worry, it's covered by
the initiation fee, all right?

19:20.898 --> 19:22.335
This tracks your calories,

19:22.378 --> 19:23.640
it tracks your sleeping pattern,

19:23.684 --> 19:25.076
how much you walk.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.949
So, that's for you.

19:27.992 --> 19:29.690
If you give me your phone,
I can set it up for you.

19:33.998 --> 19:36.262
That's really nice of you.

19:37.654 --> 19:38.916
Thank you so much.

19:40.831 --> 19:42.050
You're so welcome.

19:44.618 --> 19:47.621
- Wanna do some cardio?
- Do I have a choice?

19:47.664 --> 19:49.405
- Absolutely not.
- Then I'll do it.

19:49.449 --> 19:50.754
That's my girl.

19:52.669 --> 19:53.844
[overhead techno music playing]

20:07.989 --> 20:09.251
[knock at door]

20:09.295 --> 20:10.296
Hey.

20:10.339 --> 20:11.645
Hey.

20:11.688 --> 20:13.037
I think I've hit a wall.

20:13.081 --> 20:14.256
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:14.300 --> 20:15.257
How far did you run?

20:15.301 --> 20:19.218
Uh, maybe ten minutes. Maybe.

20:19.261 --> 20:20.219
- Ten minutes?
- Maybe.

20:20.262 --> 20:21.220
Okay.

20:22.873 --> 20:25.049
Here's your phone back.

20:25.093 --> 20:26.355
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

20:26.399 --> 20:28.357
So, let's, uh,
get you out of here.

20:28.401 --> 20:29.706
- Yes, please.
- [Trey chuckles]

20:30.533 --> 20:31.795
Thank you.

20:31.839 --> 20:32.970
Hey.

20:33.014 --> 20:34.624
- Hey!
- Hi!

20:34.668 --> 20:35.843
Hey, how's your workout?

20:35.886 --> 20:37.845
- It's great.
- Leslie.

20:37.888 --> 20:42.502
Hi, Trey. So, I scouted out some
of the local talent for you.

20:42.545 --> 20:44.199
What do you think
about that guy?

20:44.243 --> 20:45.548
I think his name is Mark,

20:45.592 --> 20:47.681
and he's in marketing
or something.

20:49.073 --> 20:50.597
Oh, Mark in marketing?

20:50.640 --> 20:53.339
- Or what? Like Trey in training?
- [Mel chuckles]

20:53.382 --> 20:55.297
I think you should ask him out.

20:55.341 --> 20:56.255
Um...

20:58.561 --> 21:00.824
- I am here to work.
- That's my girl.

21:07.527 --> 21:08.441
[fork clinks]

21:20.757 --> 21:21.628
[cell phone beeping]

21:25.936 --> 21:27.764
[dramatic music playing]

21:37.644 --> 21:38.601
[grunting]

21:42.126 --> 21:43.127
Whoo!

21:44.390 --> 21:46.305
Good job, killer.

21:47.741 --> 21:49.308
- Thank you.
- Let's raise it.

21:50.352 --> 21:51.353
Give me that.

21:52.615 --> 21:54.182
Drink this.

21:54.225 --> 21:55.966
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

21:58.404 --> 21:59.970
[panting]

22:00.014 --> 22:01.320
Wait a minute.

22:01.363 --> 22:02.321
[dramatic music playing]

22:02.364 --> 22:03.670
What's wrong?

22:03.713 --> 22:05.802
Is there matcha in this?

22:05.846 --> 22:07.195
Yeah.

22:07.238 --> 22:08.152
Is that okay?

22:09.980 --> 22:11.808
- It's perfect.
- [Trey chuckling]

22:11.852 --> 22:14.594
I used to drink these
obsessively

22:14.637 --> 22:15.595
when I was training in college.

22:15.638 --> 22:16.944
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:16.987 --> 22:18.249
I thought I was
the only person who knew

22:18.293 --> 22:19.425
about matcha and protein.

22:19.468 --> 22:21.165
- It's delicious, right?
- Totally.

22:21.209 --> 22:24.908
- Mm?
- Oh. Takes me back.

22:24.952 --> 22:26.736
So good.

22:26.780 --> 22:29.739
So, what's the deal
with this ex?

22:29.783 --> 22:32.394
No offense, but I do not think

22:32.438 --> 22:35.223
youare the right confidant
for this sort of thing.

22:36.485 --> 22:38.487
- Ow.
- No, I just...

22:38.531 --> 22:41.142
I think that you've
probably never been dumped.

22:41.185 --> 22:43.884
Oh, no, I've, I've been dumped.

22:43.927 --> 22:45.407
You want me tell you
the first story?

22:45.451 --> 22:47.627
Yes, I do, because
I do not believe you.

22:47.670 --> 22:51.152
Okay. When I was in high school,
I had a crush on this girl,

22:51.195 --> 22:54.242
um, so I went to pick her up at
her house, and when I got there

22:54.285 --> 22:58.681
there was a Post-it note
on her door that just said "No."

22:58.725 --> 23:01.423
Oh-ho, you must have been
hideous.

23:01.467 --> 23:03.947
- Oh-ho-ho! Yeah, laugh it up.
- [laughs]

23:03.991 --> 23:05.775
- Oh!
- I know.

23:05.819 --> 23:09.431
Okay. Okay, so, Carter...

23:09.475 --> 23:12.434
Carter broke up, well...
the thing about Carter is that

23:12.478 --> 23:14.784
I told him that after five years

23:14.828 --> 23:16.699
he still didn't know me
at-at all.

23:16.743 --> 23:19.223
I mean, he did,
but he didn't care.

23:19.267 --> 23:23.140
I am deathly afraid
of heights and...

23:23.184 --> 23:27.144
he wanted us to go climbing
in the Alps.

23:27.188 --> 23:28.102
That's bad.

23:32.236 --> 23:34.761
What? I don't...

23:34.804 --> 23:35.805
I have an idea.

23:35.849 --> 23:37.416
Oh, what is that?

23:37.459 --> 23:39.940
- Are you up for a field trip?
- I don't...

23:39.983 --> 23:41.115
- It's right next door.
- I don't trust...

23:41.158 --> 23:42.116
Say yes.

23:42.725 --> 23:44.118
Okay...

23:44.161 --> 23:45.685
- Let's go.
- Okay. Okay.

23:45.728 --> 23:48.601
Okay. Now, I was saving this

23:48.644 --> 23:50.559
for later
in your training, but...

23:52.561 --> 23:54.955
I think you need it now.

23:54.998 --> 23:56.522
It's great for building
grip strength,

23:56.565 --> 23:57.566
upper body strength

23:57.610 --> 24:00.308
and, you know...

24:00.351 --> 24:01.918
facing your demons.

24:03.833 --> 24:07.576
Huh. I don't know if I...

24:07.620 --> 24:12.363
Listen, you're stronger than you
think you are, okay?

24:12.407 --> 24:14.191
But we don't have to do this
if you're not comfortable.

24:18.326 --> 24:19.545
No, I want to.

24:19.588 --> 24:20.720
Are you sure?

24:21.590 --> 24:22.548
Uh-huh.

24:23.853 --> 24:25.899
Okay. Let's do it.

24:27.204 --> 24:28.989
[panting]

24:29.032 --> 24:30.512
You look great.

24:30.556 --> 24:31.948
- [Mel grunting]
- Good.

24:31.992 --> 24:33.167
[Trey] You look great.

24:35.430 --> 24:37.171
- I can't do this.
- [Trey] Yes, you can.

24:37.214 --> 24:38.259
- I can't.
- [Trey] Yes, you can.

24:38.302 --> 24:39.390
I don't want to hear that.

24:39.434 --> 24:40.653
You got this, Mel.

24:40.696 --> 24:43.307
I will not let you fall,
all right?

24:43.351 --> 24:44.483
- You wanna reach the top?
- [Mel] Yes.

24:44.526 --> 24:45.962
Okay. Climb.

24:46.006 --> 24:47.747
[Trey] Listen to my voice.
My voice only.

24:47.790 --> 24:49.357
I believe in you, Mel.
You got this.

24:49.400 --> 24:50.880
I will not let you fall.

24:50.924 --> 24:52.621
[Mel grunting] Okay, okay.

24:54.057 --> 24:56.364
- [Mel grunting]
- [Trey] Good job.

24:56.407 --> 24:57.844
- I can't breathe.
- Hey.

24:57.887 --> 24:59.541
[Mel] I can't breathe.

24:59.585 --> 25:01.282
Hey! Relax, okay?

25:01.325 --> 25:03.893
Take it one handhold at a time.
You got this.

25:03.937 --> 25:05.199
- Um, have you seen Mel?
- Sorry, please hold.

25:05.242 --> 25:06.722
She's probably with Trey.

25:06.766 --> 25:08.681
They're next door.

25:08.724 --> 25:10.813
- At the climbing wall?
- Yes, that's right.

25:10.857 --> 25:13.773
Oh. Okay. All right.

25:13.816 --> 25:15.644
I believe in you. You got this.

25:15.688 --> 25:18.299
- [Mel panting] I can't...
- [Trey] Breathe.

25:18.342 --> 25:20.606
You got this, Mel. Okay?

25:20.649 --> 25:22.869
Listen to my voice.
My voice only, okay?

25:24.740 --> 25:26.002
[Trey] Come on, Mel.
You got this.

25:26.046 --> 25:27.134
I can't...

25:28.962 --> 25:29.789
- [Mel groaning]
- [Trey] Good.

25:34.184 --> 25:35.272
[Leslie] What the hell
are you doing?

25:35.316 --> 25:36.360
That's her safety.

25:36.404 --> 25:38.580
Bring her down, Trey. Right now.

25:38.624 --> 25:41.235
I can't.
I believe in you, Mel, okay?

25:41.278 --> 25:42.802
She has to do it now.

25:42.845 --> 25:44.978
[Trey] You got this, Mel.
I believe in you!

25:45.021 --> 25:47.415
Okay? Reach that top. One more.

25:49.330 --> 25:51.114
You got this, Mel!
I believe in you!

25:52.638 --> 25:54.770
[panting]

25:54.814 --> 25:56.511
- [Mel grunts]
- [Trey] Yes!

25:56.555 --> 25:58.339
[Trey applauding] Whoo!

25:59.732 --> 26:03.170
Good job, Mel! You did it!

26:03.213 --> 26:04.911
- He could have killed you.
- Look, he knew I could do it.

26:04.954 --> 26:06.390
I was safe the whole time.

26:06.434 --> 26:08.044
Okay, he guessed
you could do it.

26:08.088 --> 26:09.480
Thanks for the vote
of confidence.

26:09.524 --> 26:11.265
What, he gambled with your life.
I'm sorry.

26:11.308 --> 26:13.920
How do you not see
how irresponsible that was?

26:13.963 --> 26:15.835
You were the one who wanted me
to take more risks.

26:15.878 --> 26:18.185
Yeah, smart risks,
not ridiculous,

26:18.228 --> 26:19.752
silly, life-threatening risks.

26:19.795 --> 26:22.755
That was not silly!
That was important for me.

26:22.798 --> 26:24.713
I have been afraid of heights
my entire life,

26:24.757 --> 26:26.585
and I just did something
about it.

26:26.628 --> 26:28.978
In the most dangerous way
possible.

26:29.022 --> 26:31.111
Trey knew I could do it.
He believed in me.

26:31.154 --> 26:32.112
Why can't you?

26:32.155 --> 26:33.809
[sighs]

26:33.853 --> 26:37.857
No one believes in you more than
I do. Okay?

26:37.900 --> 26:39.554
You're my best friend.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.338
I love you.

26:41.382 --> 26:43.384
But I just... I care about you.

26:43.427 --> 26:45.908
And I don't want you
to get hurt, okay?

26:51.522 --> 26:53.394
I'm sorry I scared you.

26:55.352 --> 26:57.224
Sorry, I was kind of a bitch
about it.

27:09.671 --> 27:10.977
Hello again.

27:13.806 --> 27:15.677
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

27:19.202 --> 27:22.728
So I've been thinking a lot
about the last time I was here.

27:22.771 --> 27:24.512
- Oh.
- Yeah.

27:24.555 --> 27:27.950
I mean, some things are just
too beautiful to forget.

27:27.994 --> 27:29.256
I'd like to buy it.

27:30.170 --> 27:32.041
Chrysalis.

27:32.085 --> 27:33.347
Of course. Yes.

27:33.390 --> 27:35.088
I'll just look it up.

27:35.131 --> 27:37.220
So, it needs to stay on the wall

27:37.264 --> 27:39.222
until after the exhibition
is over,

27:39.266 --> 27:40.920
but I will have it
delivered after.

27:40.963 --> 27:43.400
Actually, I'd prefer
to pick it up.

27:45.098 --> 27:47.927
I, uh...

27:47.970 --> 27:50.233
can't stop thinking
about the gallery owner.

27:56.675 --> 28:00.722
Well, there is a closing-night
party on the 15th.

28:00.766 --> 28:03.551
- You're welcome to come.
- Um...

28:03.594 --> 28:05.901
I'd love to, but I think
I have a dinner on the 15th,

28:05.945 --> 28:07.773
so I'm not sure I'd make it.

28:08.948 --> 28:10.210
What time does it end?

28:10.253 --> 28:11.341
Ten.

28:14.823 --> 28:17.086
- That actually works.
- [Mel chuckles]

28:17.130 --> 28:19.132
And when are you free?

28:19.175 --> 28:22.701
Uh, how about Saturday? 8:00?

28:23.658 --> 28:24.920
All right.

28:24.964 --> 28:26.269
It's a date.

28:26.313 --> 28:27.662
[chuckles]

28:29.490 --> 28:30.752
- Bye.
- Bye.

28:34.234 --> 28:36.105
[exhales]

28:37.324 --> 28:38.978
Okay...

28:44.897 --> 28:46.550
[cell phone ringing]

28:51.860 --> 28:53.949
Hey, Leslie.

28:53.993 --> 28:56.691
[Leslie over phone] Hey, babe.
I'm so sorry to bug you.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.476
It's not about your hot date.
Though I expect details later.

28:59.520 --> 29:01.652
Naturally. What's going on?

29:01.696 --> 29:03.263
[Leslie over phone] I got a flat
and I'm supposed to be

29:03.306 --> 29:04.917
at the office, like, yesterday.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.745
Do you think I could
trouble you for a ride?

29:06.788 --> 29:08.747
Oh, yeah, yeah. Um, hang on.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.969
[sighs] Sure. Yeah. No sweat.

29:14.013 --> 29:16.406
You're a legend!
I'll see you soon.

29:16.450 --> 29:18.104
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

29:22.891 --> 29:24.763
Okay, if you can pull yourself

29:24.806 --> 29:26.503
away from the electronics
for a second,

29:26.547 --> 29:28.070
we have arrived.

29:28.114 --> 29:30.594
Well, to say thank you,
I jail-broke your phone

29:30.638 --> 29:33.815
and made all the little icons
into little flowers.

29:33.859 --> 29:36.818
Oh, wow. That's so invasive.

29:36.862 --> 29:38.385
Thank you,
my little tech friend.

29:38.428 --> 29:40.561
You are so welcome.

29:40.604 --> 29:42.128
Well, I am so sorry
that I made you late.

29:42.171 --> 29:44.260
I'm sure Trey will be merciful.

29:44.304 --> 29:46.262
All right, see ya.

29:46.306 --> 29:47.220
[Leslie] Okay.

29:47.916 --> 29:48.874
Bye.

29:51.441 --> 29:54.531
- Hey. I am so sorry I'm late.
- What happened?

29:54.575 --> 29:56.446
Oh, Leslie just
needed a ride to work.

29:56.490 --> 29:57.665
Something with her car.

29:59.449 --> 30:00.929
What?

30:00.973 --> 30:02.801
Nothing. Come on,
let's get started.

30:02.844 --> 30:04.585
No, no. What is it?

30:06.630 --> 30:09.720
It's just... I've, I've kinda
seen this thing before.

30:09.764 --> 30:10.896
Now, someone's actually
made progress

30:10.939 --> 30:12.027
and feel I've been
supporting them,

30:12.071 --> 30:14.247
they just start to...

30:14.290 --> 30:15.596
derail them in small ways.

30:15.639 --> 30:17.728
I don't know.

30:17.772 --> 30:19.992
No. I don't think
that's what's happening.

30:20.035 --> 30:21.776
[chuckles]

30:21.820 --> 30:23.734
No. I'm sure you're right.

30:23.778 --> 30:25.214
Here, before we get started,

30:25.258 --> 30:28.174
I, uh, I got you
a little something.

30:28.217 --> 30:30.002
- What is this?
- Just open it.

30:33.570 --> 30:36.443
It's a key to the gym. Kinda
like your home away from home.

30:36.486 --> 30:38.358
A lot of clients have 'em.
It's kinda like a...

30:38.401 --> 30:40.186
It's like a rite of passage.

30:41.187 --> 30:43.232
That is so cool.

30:43.276 --> 30:45.539
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

30:45.582 --> 30:46.801
- Ready to get started?
- Yeah.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.542
- Come on. Let's do it.
- Let's go.

30:51.545 --> 30:53.112
[soft piano music playing]

30:55.288 --> 30:57.333
Did I tell you
you look stunning?

30:57.377 --> 30:59.292
Yes, you did.

30:59.335 --> 31:01.250
But thank you again.

31:01.294 --> 31:02.251
[Adam chuckles softly]

31:02.295 --> 31:03.296
[Mel chuckles]

31:05.646 --> 31:09.084
So, do you wanna tell me why...

31:09.128 --> 31:11.913
a great guy like you
didn't already have a date

31:11.957 --> 31:13.480
on a Saturday night?

31:16.135 --> 31:18.877
Well, actually I recently
broke up with someone.

31:20.748 --> 31:22.706
Yeah, I...

31:22.750 --> 31:25.231
kind of sworn off dating there
for a while...

31:26.319 --> 31:27.668
till I met you.

31:29.278 --> 31:31.759
Do you wanna talk about it?

31:31.802 --> 31:34.893
Nothing to talk about really.

31:34.936 --> 31:36.720
I felt like she didn't really
know me after three years

31:36.764 --> 31:38.548
of being together, you know?

31:40.463 --> 31:41.638
Mm...

31:43.336 --> 31:44.250
How 'bout you?

31:45.729 --> 31:46.687
Same.

31:47.688 --> 31:50.038
But five years.

31:50.082 --> 31:51.474
He thought my favorite color
was blue.

31:51.518 --> 31:54.042
Mm. It's purple, right?

31:54.086 --> 31:55.435
Yeah, you've worn
a little piece of it

31:55.478 --> 31:57.611
with every outfit
I've seen you in so far.

32:03.138 --> 32:06.141
- Ah, this is it.
- Yeah, this is me.

32:06.185 --> 32:08.274
- I love it.
- Thank you. I do, too.

32:08.317 --> 32:09.449
Yeah.

32:12.582 --> 32:14.410
I want to see you again.

32:15.455 --> 32:16.412
Ditto.

32:20.677 --> 32:22.375

[overhead techno music playing]

32:33.212 --> 32:34.430
[Mel grunting]

32:37.956 --> 32:39.914
Come on, tired girl.

32:39.958 --> 32:40.871
What, late night?

32:42.047 --> 32:43.570
[chuckles]

32:43.613 --> 32:45.920
Yes, I had a date.

32:47.791 --> 32:49.750
Good. One more.

32:51.317 --> 32:52.709
[Mel straining]

32:54.494 --> 32:56.844
[Mel breathing heavily]

32:56.887 --> 32:58.759
That's my girl.

33:00.152 --> 33:02.502
Okay.

33:02.545 --> 33:04.939
So, this date...

33:04.983 --> 33:06.506
anything serious?

33:06.549 --> 33:08.595
I hope so.

33:08.638 --> 33:11.032
I'm seeing him again
this Saturday.

33:11.076 --> 33:13.513
- Wow. Saturday?
- [Mel chuckles]

33:13.556 --> 33:16.690
It's... moving
a little fast, no?

33:16.733 --> 33:19.432
I don't know.

33:19.475 --> 33:22.043
I think when you see
something you want, you...

33:22.087 --> 33:23.305
you go for it, right?

33:24.350 --> 33:26.221
Right.

33:26.265 --> 33:27.396
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

33:27.440 --> 33:28.876
See you next time.

33:31.096 --> 33:32.532
[dramatic music playing]

33:35.883 --> 33:37.798
- I think this one.
- Yeah.

33:37.841 --> 33:39.669
Let's go with this one.

33:44.022 --> 33:47.155
- [gasps]
- I'm stalking you.

33:47.199 --> 33:50.028
In broad daylight
at my place of business?

33:50.071 --> 33:51.464
Brilliant.

33:51.507 --> 33:53.248
[Mel chuckles softly]

33:53.292 --> 33:54.684
So what time
are you finished here?

33:54.728 --> 33:56.251
Uh, never.

33:56.295 --> 33:59.385
No, we just got
this new collection and I'm...

33:59.428 --> 34:02.953
- I'm freaking out.
- Well, can I help?

34:02.997 --> 34:05.347
How much do you know about
modern silver gelatin prints?

34:06.783 --> 34:08.784
Well, I could bring you
take-out.

34:08.829 --> 34:10.786
[chuckles] Well, I can't.

34:10.831 --> 34:12.266
Training diet.

34:12.311 --> 34:14.181
I can cook for you.

34:14.226 --> 34:16.097
Something healthy.

34:16.141 --> 34:18.012
I mean, you gotta eat.

34:19.318 --> 34:20.275
Okay.

34:21.842 --> 34:23.887
I mean, it might be late.

34:23.931 --> 34:25.193
Perfect.

34:27.500 --> 34:28.588
[soft instrumental music]

34:28.630 --> 34:30.677
How'd you learn how to do that?

34:32.331 --> 34:34.376
Well, my mother passed away
when I was a kid

34:34.420 --> 34:38.337
but... not before
she taught me how to cook.

34:39.686 --> 34:40.947
I'm sorry.

34:42.123 --> 34:43.690
She must have been very special.

34:43.733 --> 34:46.301
Yeah, she was.

34:46.344 --> 34:49.348
She... really knew her way
around the kitchen,

34:49.391 --> 34:52.002
and, uh...

34:52.045 --> 34:53.612
she had your sense of style.

34:55.484 --> 34:57.182
What about you? How'd you, uh...

34:57.225 --> 34:58.531
How'd you get into fine art?

34:59.880 --> 35:02.361
Well, I ran track in college

35:02.404 --> 35:04.972
so I wanted an easy major.

35:05.015 --> 35:07.279
- Art history?
- Art history. [chuckles]

35:07.322 --> 35:08.802
Yes.

35:08.845 --> 35:11.152
Yeah, and then I ended up
loving it.

35:11.196 --> 35:13.807
So, I was living in Brooklyn
after college

35:13.850 --> 35:15.504
wearing a lot of black...

35:15.548 --> 35:16.723
Sexy.

35:18.290 --> 35:20.596
And I started working

35:20.640 --> 35:24.034
as an assistant in this
hole in the wall gallery.

35:24.078 --> 35:26.254
I worked my way up to curator.

35:26.298 --> 35:27.560
There really wasn't a lot else
you could do

35:27.603 --> 35:29.301
with an art history degree.

35:29.344 --> 35:31.085
I mean, unless you have
a lot of money and can become

35:31.129 --> 35:34.001
a major collector,
which I just didn't.

35:34.044 --> 35:36.438
[chuckles] But no offense
to you.

35:36.482 --> 35:38.353
None taken.

35:38.397 --> 35:40.007
Well, the only reason
why I have money to collect is

35:40.050 --> 35:42.140
because I started collecting.

35:44.403 --> 35:45.926
How did you get started?

35:47.971 --> 35:51.366
Well, my father was a man who

35:51.410 --> 35:53.325
believed in what he could touch.

35:53.368 --> 35:54.587
What he could understand.

35:54.630 --> 35:57.894
He didn't believe
in art or music

35:57.938 --> 36:00.810
or any of that nonsense.

36:00.854 --> 36:02.638
Hmm.

36:02.682 --> 36:05.250
Anyway, when I was nine,
I wanted piano lessons.

36:05.293 --> 36:08.862
He, uh... gave me
a subscription of Forbes.

36:08.905 --> 36:10.951
[chuckles] Ugh!

36:10.994 --> 36:13.083
- Exactly my reaction.
- Hmm.

36:13.127 --> 36:15.347
So, anyway, when he passed,

36:15.390 --> 36:18.132
he left me
a little bit of money.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.700
Well, I used it to buy
an early Buona Sera.

36:20.743 --> 36:22.702
My favorite.

36:22.745 --> 36:24.356
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

36:28.664 --> 36:30.884
So, why'd you keep collecting
after you made your point?

36:35.236 --> 36:36.803
I fell in love.

37:10.315 --> 37:12.230
I think our food's
gonna get cold.

37:13.753 --> 37:15.581
I think I'm okay with that.

it's my reminder alarm.

38:13.465 --> 38:14.814
I'm late.

38:14.857 --> 38:16.337
- Training?
- Yeah.

38:16.381 --> 38:17.947
Yeah, my trainer is a bit
of a stickler.

38:17.991 --> 38:20.167
Mm. [chuckles]

38:20.210 --> 38:21.647
Well, maybe,
I should meet you at the gym

38:21.690 --> 38:23.257
sometime for a workout.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.651
- Protect you from the stickler.
- Oh.

38:25.694 --> 38:27.217
I'll hold you to that.

38:27.261 --> 38:29.872
Hey, you can hold me anytime.
[chuckles]

38:29.916 --> 38:31.744
- You like that?
- Uh-huh.

38:37.184 --> 38:38.359
Good morning.

38:39.273 --> 38:40.230
Morning.

38:45.714 --> 38:49.370
[Mel chuckles] Mm, I need to go.

38:49.414 --> 38:50.676
Yeah, I can't believe
you're turning down

38:53.156 --> 38:54.462
You are so strong.

38:54.506 --> 38:56.464
I amso strong.

39:02.949 --> 39:04.342
- Talk soon?
- Oh, yeah.

39:04.385 --> 39:07.257
- Make plans?
- Absolutely.

39:07.301 --> 39:09.172
You're not getting rid of me
that easily.

39:11.436 --> 39:13.438
- Don't get too buff.
- [chuckles]

39:13.481 --> 39:15.396
That's right. You believe
in the beauty of imperfection.

39:15.440 --> 39:18.094
Mm-hmm. Hey, Melissa.

39:18.138 --> 39:19.574
You are perfect.

39:45.295 --> 39:46.253
Hey!

39:47.341 --> 39:49.430
Trey. You scared me.

39:49.474 --> 39:51.519
What are you doing here?

39:51.563 --> 39:53.042
You weren't on time,
so I figured you might like

39:53.086 --> 39:54.740
a nice... walk to the gym
this morning.

39:56.306 --> 39:58.961
- Okay. Sure.
- [Trey] Yeah? Cool.

39:59.005 --> 39:59.919
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

40:01.529 --> 40:04.184
Oh, here. I made that for you.

40:04.227 --> 40:06.229
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

passing out like that.

No, you have nothing to be sorry
about.

- Yeah.

- Okay.

you know I will never
let anything happen to you.

43:30.564 --> 43:32.305
Never. Right?

43:33.132 --> 43:34.220
Okay.

Tell you what,
why don't you, uh...

sit here for another minute
and...

I'll get some
more ice water in this.

43:44.491 --> 43:46.667
All right? I'll be right back.

43:56.459 --> 43:58.679
So, you just dropped?

43:58.723 --> 43:59.854
Yeah.

43:59.898 --> 44:01.682
Well...

44:01.726 --> 44:05.686
you have been getting
a lot of cardio lately.

called in a...

44:17.219 --> 44:19.047
A what? Like, an hour?

44:19.091 --> 44:22.398
No, in... a while. I mean...

44:22.442 --> 44:23.965
Ugh. You've always been
so clueless

44:24.009 --> 44:25.880
about your admirers.

44:25.924 --> 44:27.577
- What admirers?
- Ugh.

44:27.621 --> 44:30.015
In college
you had the entire track team

44:30.058 --> 44:31.364
on lock-down
because of your legs,

44:31.407 --> 44:34.019
and then there were
the art geeks,

44:34.062 --> 44:36.761
and then there was that guy.

44:36.804 --> 44:41.026
Who is that guy
with the, um... hearts?

44:41.069 --> 44:42.505
- Th-the hearts guy.
- What?

44:42.549 --> 44:44.812
The construction paper
hearts guy.

44:44.856 --> 44:47.467
Come on. He was like,
he was like that, that weird,

44:47.510 --> 44:50.775
shy guy, big guy.

44:50.818 --> 44:52.515
Come on, what was his name?

44:52.559 --> 44:54.039
I don't, I don't remember.
I don't know.

44:54.082 --> 44:55.954
- What?
- Mmm.

44:55.997 --> 44:59.697
He would leave heart-shaped
notes under our dorm room door,

44:59.740 --> 45:02.482
like, everyday.

45:02.525 --> 45:04.702
I can't believe
you don't remember his name.

45:07.443 --> 45:09.750
Ugh. I have to go.

45:09.794 --> 45:12.622
Mm? What? It's early.

45:12.666 --> 45:15.408
Well, I have to go make dinner
and catalog the new exhibit

45:15.451 --> 45:17.758
which will take hours, mind you,
and then...

45:17.802 --> 45:19.934
I don't know. I have to train
in the morning. So... yeah.

45:19.978 --> 45:22.720
You can stand to miss one day.

45:25.287 --> 45:27.812
- What?
- Just stop it. I have to train.

45:27.855 --> 45:30.858
Oh, my God. You are obsessed
with training.

45:33.818 --> 45:36.472
Well, maybe you're obsessed
with derailing me.

45:36.516 --> 45:38.170
What? I'm the one who
brought you to the gym

45:38.213 --> 45:40.346
in the first place, remember?

45:40.389 --> 45:42.087
I do remember.

45:42.130 --> 45:43.871
And now I'm getting back
in shape, and I'm dating again,

45:43.915 --> 45:45.177
and you're over it.

45:45.220 --> 45:47.266
Are you serious?

45:47.309 --> 45:49.355
I can't believe you would
say something like that.

45:49.398 --> 45:52.532
Because you don't seem to
understand that I have to train.

45:52.575 --> 45:55.056
Because your fitness goals
are not the gravitational anchor

45:55.100 --> 45:56.928
around which my world spins.

46:03.848 --> 46:05.632
You know, Trey said
you would do this.

46:05.675 --> 46:07.199
Oh, what, Trey?

01:01:59.106 --> 01:02:01.979
broken in and trashed
the gallery, so...

01:02:04.372 --> 01:02:05.765
Sorry to hear that.

01:02:06.897 --> 01:02:07.854
Thanks.

01:02:09.856 --> 01:02:11.423
Yeah, I filed a police report

01:02:11.466 --> 01:02:12.946
and an insurance claim,
but I can't really

01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:15.253
do anything until
the clean-up crews are gone.

01:02:15.296 --> 01:02:16.210
Yeah, sure.

01:02:16.907 --> 01:02:17.951
Yeah.

01:02:23.435 --> 01:02:25.350
You should probably
give me your key.

01:02:25.393 --> 01:02:27.134
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:27.178 --> 01:02:28.614
[keys jingling]

01:02:35.403 --> 01:02:38.580
- So, you home alone?
- Yes.

01:02:38.624 --> 01:02:41.888
- Who else would be here?
- [chuckling] Oh...

01:02:41.932 --> 01:02:43.890
Your new boyfriend?

01:02:43.934 --> 01:02:45.326
I know you didn't text me.

01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:47.720
What are you talking about?

01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:50.157
Your psychotic new boyfriend.

01:02:50.201 --> 01:02:53.421
You know, actually, I shouldn't
even be talking to you.

01:02:53.465 --> 01:02:56.337
Who are you talking about?

01:02:56.381 --> 01:02:58.470
- Adam?
- I don't know his name.

01:02:58.513 --> 01:03:00.037
He said some pretty vile stuff.

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:01.821
Like what?

01:03:01.865 --> 01:03:03.475
Well, aside from

01:03:03.518 --> 01:03:05.825
jamming body parts
into other body parts,

01:03:05.869 --> 01:03:08.219
to basically stay away from you.

01:03:08.262 --> 01:03:10.221
[scoffs] What?

01:03:10.264 --> 01:03:11.613
Oh, look, Mel,

01:03:11.657 --> 01:03:12.919
I'm happy to see you,

01:03:12.963 --> 01:03:14.965
and honestly,
you look incredible.

01:03:15.008 --> 01:03:16.836
But tell your demented
new boy toy

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.447
if he texts me again,
I'm calling the police.

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:22.537
- Carter, w...
- [Leslie] Hey!

01:03:22.581 --> 01:03:24.148
- Carter.
- Hey.

01:03:27.368 --> 01:03:29.718
- What is he doing here?
- Come in.

01:03:29.762 --> 01:03:30.981
So Carter said he got some

01:03:31.024 --> 01:03:32.417
crazy weird text from me,

01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:33.810
but I didn't send them.

01:03:33.853 --> 01:03:35.463
I didn't send anything.

01:03:35.507 --> 01:03:37.161
Mel, you are lucky that I am

01:03:37.204 --> 01:03:39.337
a technological genius.

01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:40.817
I am so lucky.

01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:43.645
I say it every morning
like a mantra.

01:03:43.689 --> 01:03:45.038
[sarcastically] Ha-ha.

01:03:45.082 --> 01:03:47.040
All right. Oh, boy.

01:03:48.259 --> 01:03:50.261
Yowza!

01:03:50.304 --> 01:03:52.393
Where is your laptop
in this mess?

01:03:52.437 --> 01:03:54.700
- [Mel] Keep digging.
- Okay, here it is.

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.052
Okay. [clears throat]

01:03:59.096 --> 01:04:00.314
- Okay...
- [keys clacking]

01:04:00.358 --> 01:04:02.273
So, if someone were

01:04:02.316 --> 01:04:04.231
sending Carter weird texts...

01:04:04.275 --> 01:04:05.667
I'll find out who.

01:04:05.711 --> 01:04:07.713
Just let a master work.

01:04:07.756 --> 01:04:10.542
[inhales] I also need
to remember Carter's number

01:04:10.585 --> 01:04:12.326
because I blocked it out
when he dumped you.

01:04:12.370 --> 01:04:13.937
[Mel chuckles] Me too.

01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:18.680
Bingo. Take a look at this.

01:04:18.724 --> 01:04:20.813
[Mel gasps]

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:23.033
Wow! How'd you do that?
That's like magic.

01:04:23.076 --> 01:04:25.252
Ah. More like
advanced computer science.

01:04:25.296 --> 01:04:26.950
So, yeah, magic.

01:04:26.993 --> 01:04:28.429
Is it even legal?

01:04:29.953 --> 01:04:31.563
Oh, geez.

01:04:31.606 --> 01:04:34.131
Okay. So, what are
we looking at?

01:04:34.174 --> 01:04:36.133
Carter's incoming texts.

01:04:36.176 --> 01:04:37.917
This is the longest one.

01:04:44.271 --> 01:04:46.752
Super creepy, and there are

01:04:46.795 --> 01:04:48.232
tons just like this

01:04:48.275 --> 01:04:49.929
from the exact same number.

01:04:49.973 --> 01:04:51.583
Whose?

01:04:51.626 --> 01:04:52.932
[keys clacking]

01:04:55.543 --> 01:04:57.241
Yours.

01:04:57.284 --> 01:04:58.895
[soft music playing]

01:05:09.383 --> 01:05:11.124
What the hell.

01:05:13.126 --> 01:05:14.736
So, who would have access
to your phone?

01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:16.695
I mean, nobody.
It's always locked up.

01:05:16.738 --> 01:05:18.653
- At work, at the gym.
- Think.

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:20.917
Um...

01:05:24.094 --> 01:05:26.748
- Adam.
- Okay. Let's call him.

01:05:26.792 --> 01:05:27.967
Ah, okay.

01:05:28.011 --> 01:05:29.664
Well, you call him,

01:05:29.708 --> 01:05:31.492
because every time I call him,
it just cuts off.

01:05:31.536 --> 01:05:33.320
I mean, I don't know
what's up, so...

01:05:35.453 --> 01:05:37.542
[busy tone, call drops]

01:05:37.585 --> 01:05:39.109
- It's blocked.
- What?

01:05:39.152 --> 01:05:40.806
[Leslie] It's blocked,
he blocked you.

01:05:43.896 --> 01:05:45.593
That doesn't make any sense.

01:05:47.247 --> 01:05:49.946
Look, I'm sure you were
amazing in bed,

01:05:49.989 --> 01:05:51.773
but he definitely blocked you.

01:05:52.644 --> 01:05:54.080
No, I mean...

01:05:56.169 --> 01:05:59.433
Well, if, if he doesn't want
anything to do with me, then...

01:06:01.218 --> 01:06:02.393
Wow.

01:06:04.047 --> 01:06:05.526
But he...

01:06:05.570 --> 01:06:06.875
W-why would he go through
the trouble

01:06:06.919 --> 01:06:08.486
of texting Carter from my phone?

01:06:10.488 --> 01:06:13.230
Look, I know you don't like
getting any flak for wonder boy

01:06:13.273 --> 01:06:15.667
at the gym, but...

01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:18.104
he would have access
to your phone.

01:06:18.148 --> 01:06:20.324
Okay, I admit that Trey
has been weird lately,

01:06:20.367 --> 01:06:21.629
actually, very weird,

01:06:21.673 --> 01:06:24.371
but... I mean...

01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:28.636
he changed my life.

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:30.029
No.

01:06:30.073 --> 01:06:31.813
You changed your life.

01:06:32.597 --> 01:06:34.468
[sighs]

01:06:34.512 --> 01:06:36.775
Okay, so let's go
check out the gym

01:06:36.818 --> 01:06:39.082
and do a little
reconnaissance, okay?

01:06:39.125 --> 01:06:40.909
Shoot. I can't.

01:06:40.953 --> 01:06:42.520
I have that closing
exhibit reception

01:06:42.563 --> 01:06:44.087
at the gallery tonight,
I have to go down there

01:06:44.130 --> 01:06:45.392
and make sure
I can even pull it off

01:06:45.436 --> 01:06:47.003
with all the vandalism.

01:06:47.046 --> 01:06:48.613
- You're still doing that?
- I have to.

01:06:48.656 --> 01:06:50.397
What am I gonna do,
just lose my money on it?

01:06:50.441 --> 01:06:52.095
Good point, good point, okay.

01:06:52.138 --> 01:06:54.097
So while you get ready for that,

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:56.186
I will see what I can
find out at the gym,

01:06:56.229 --> 01:06:58.362
and then we will meet back up
at the gallery party tonight.

01:06:58.405 --> 01:06:59.624
Okay.

01:07:01.365 --> 01:07:02.801
Just one thing.

01:07:04.803 --> 01:07:07.284
What are you writing?

01:07:07.327 --> 01:07:09.634
Instructions for
a backdoor IP assault.

01:07:09.677 --> 01:07:11.897
There are so many texts,
it seems unlikely

01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:14.465
that this person only texted
from your phone.

01:07:14.508 --> 01:07:16.119
I mean, if they used
a computer app

01:07:16.162 --> 01:07:17.598
to connect at any point,
and if they

01:07:17.642 --> 01:07:20.210
didn't re-route through VPN...

01:07:20.253 --> 01:07:22.212
you can track them.

01:07:22.255 --> 01:07:24.257
Okay, this is like
a foreign language to me,

01:07:24.301 --> 01:07:26.172
but... thanks.

01:07:26.216 --> 01:07:27.260
Great.

01:07:28.131 --> 01:07:29.915
Oh, and, uh...

01:07:29.958 --> 01:07:31.873
no, it's not legal.

01:07:39.881 --> 01:07:42.623
[intense music playing]

01:07:46.366 --> 01:07:48.194
[woman] Lunch Tray, Lunch Tray.

01:07:48.238 --> 01:07:50.109
Have you ever considered
exercise?

01:07:50.153 --> 01:07:51.763
[woman laughs]

01:07:51.806 --> 01:07:53.373
[overlapping chatter]
...a whole lot of fat.

01:07:53.417 --> 01:07:55.114
[man] Damn it. Lunch Tray, man.

01:07:55.158 --> 01:07:57.334
[voices echoing]

01:07:57.377 --> 01:08:00.206
[woman] You sure eat a lot.

01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:02.600
[woman] 1-800-LOSE-WEIGHT.

01:08:02.643 --> 01:08:04.906
[man] You make a person
look like a handicap.

01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:07.126
[woman] Lunch Tray, Lunch Tray.

01:08:07.170 --> 01:08:09.041
[grunting]

01:08:11.348 --> 01:08:12.740
[screaming]

01:08:17.049 --> 01:08:18.832
[breathing heavily]

01:08:21.184 --> 01:08:22.402
No.

01:08:55.609 --> 01:08:57.742
Hey, I know you guys
are closing really soon,

01:08:57.785 --> 01:08:59.004
but I wanted to know
if I could use

01:08:59.046 --> 01:09:00.875
your sauna really quick?

01:09:00.919 --> 01:09:01.876
Great.

01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:09.362
[dramatic music playing]

01:09:12.017 --> 01:09:13.323
on home, man.

01:09:13.366 --> 01:09:14.801
I'll lock up.

01:09:39.087 --> 01:09:40.045
[sighs]

01:09:42.787 --> 01:09:46.877
I had to volunteer to do recon.

01:09:46.921 --> 01:09:50.533
Oh, wow, of course he has
a photo of himself on his desk.

01:09:52.274 --> 01:09:53.493
[exhales] Okay, Trey,

01:09:53.537 --> 01:09:54.625
what have we got?

01:09:54.668 --> 01:09:56.192
Wow, lots of pills in here.

01:09:56.235 --> 01:09:58.716
Good, Trey, what else
you got here?

01:09:58.759 --> 01:10:00.196
Let's see.

01:10:01.414 --> 01:10:02.372
Bingo.

01:10:05.113 --> 01:10:06.985
Okay, boring.

01:10:07.028 --> 01:10:09.640
Huh. X-ray. Boring.

01:10:09.683 --> 01:10:10.989
Boring.

01:10:15.559 --> 01:10:17.865
Hmm. Okay.

01:10:17.909 --> 01:10:19.650
Well, hello there.

01:10:19.693 --> 01:10:21.217
Right.

01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:22.870
Okay, okay.

01:10:23.958 --> 01:10:25.395
Aww.

01:10:29.877 --> 01:10:31.923
Trey.

01:10:31.966 --> 01:10:35.187
Trey is Lunch Tray?

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:37.407
[Leslie screams, grunts]

01:10:43.195 --> 01:10:44.979
[Trey] Shhh.

01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:54.293
Hey, you chose one?

01:10:54.337 --> 01:10:56.339
It's my favorite.
[clicks tongue] Yeah.

01:10:56.382 --> 01:10:58.210
- [line ringing]
- Hello. Good to see you guys.

01:10:58.254 --> 01:10:59.124
[automated message]
Hey, you've reached Leslie.

01:10:59.167 --> 01:11:00.473
Leave a message.

01:11:00.517 --> 01:11:03.476
Leslie... where are you?
Call me back.

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:04.477
Buh-bye.

01:11:06.305 --> 01:11:08.220
Okay.

01:11:14.357 --> 01:11:16.054
Hey, you've reached Leslie.

01:11:17.577 --> 01:11:19.231
Let's see here.

01:11:21.407 --> 01:11:23.583
Backdoor IP assault.

01:11:27.108 --> 01:11:29.067
IP addresses.

01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:31.548
Gym.

01:11:36.117 --> 01:11:37.989
Okay. That's weird.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:40.818
Fitness tracker app.

01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:49.479
Trey.

01:11:54.353 --> 01:11:55.528
Oh, shit.

01:12:20.423 --> 01:12:22.207
[cell phone beeping]

01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:32.957
Come on.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.828
[whispers] Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:12:36.134 --> 01:12:37.701
No, no, no, no, no.

01:12:37.744 --> 01:12:39.093
Come on.

01:12:47.188 --> 01:12:48.494
What?

01:13:03.248 --> 01:13:04.554
[creaking]

01:13:08.035 --> 01:13:09.472
Hey, Mel?

01:13:18.959 --> 01:13:20.352
Melissa?

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:33.583
Hey, Melissa?

01:13:39.937 --> 01:13:41.852
[intense music playing]

01:14:08.269 --> 01:14:09.445
[Mel breathing heavily]

01:14:31.379 --> 01:14:32.598
[thudding, clanging]

01:14:34.861 --> 01:14:36.472
- [Leslie groaning]
- Leslie?

01:14:40.563 --> 01:14:42.826
Leslie, are you in here?

01:14:44.697 --> 01:14:46.656
- Leslie?
- [Leslie groaning]

01:14:50.007 --> 01:14:51.791
No. No, no.

01:14:51.835 --> 01:14:54.272
No, no, no, no, no. No. No.

01:14:54.315 --> 01:14:56.970
No. Shit! Shit!

01:14:57.014 --> 01:14:58.276
Leslie, I'm gonna get you
outta there.

01:14:58.319 --> 01:14:59.669
[Leslie groaning]

01:15:02.933 --> 01:15:04.630
Okay. Hang on, hang on, hang on.

01:15:06.371 --> 01:15:07.981
[grunts]

01:15:09.722 --> 01:15:11.768
Oh, come on! Open, open.

01:15:11.811 --> 01:15:13.247
Open!

01:15:14.031 --> 01:15:15.685
Open!

01:15:17.251 --> 01:15:19.036
[grunting]

01:15:20.864 --> 01:15:22.474
Oh, hey, Leslie, Leslie.

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:24.563
I'm so sorry. Okay, it's okay.

01:15:24.607 --> 01:15:26.565
It's okay, I'm here.
That's right, it's okay.

01:15:26.609 --> 01:15:28.567
Ah. Okay, I'm gonna call.

01:15:28.611 --> 01:15:30.047
Ah, it's gonna be okay.

01:15:30.917 --> 01:15:32.397
No, no, no, no.

01:15:33.224 --> 01:15:34.617
Shit.

01:15:42.625 --> 01:15:43.974
[woman on phone] 911,
what's your emergency?

01:15:44.017 --> 01:15:46.585
Yes. Yes, I need an ambulance.

01:15:46.629 --> 01:15:48.892
- Right. And the police.
- [woman] Confirm your location.

01:15:48.935 --> 01:15:50.589
- Oh, yes. I-I'm at the...
- [Trey whistling]

01:15:50.633 --> 01:15:52.635
[woman on phone]
Ma'am, hello? Are you there?

01:15:52.678 --> 01:15:54.898
- Hello?
- [Trey whistling]

01:15:58.989 --> 01:16:00.556
[footsteps approaching]

01:16:14.178 --> 01:16:15.832
[woman on phone] Ma'am, I don't
know if you can hear me,

01:16:15.875 --> 01:16:18.399
but we've traced this call
to your location.

01:16:18.443 --> 01:16:20.488
Police and ambulance
are on their way.

01:16:26.756 --> 01:16:28.018
[breathing heavily]

01:16:44.643 --> 01:16:45.601
Adam?

01:16:47.298 --> 01:16:48.647
Uh, you forgot this.

01:16:53.391 --> 01:16:54.348
What?

01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:58.309
- No-no.
- [Trey] What?

01:17:00.703 --> 01:17:02.574
Why are you scared of me, Mel?

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:05.838
- Sit.
- No.

01:17:08.058 --> 01:17:10.408
He forced you to sleep with him.

01:17:11.322 --> 01:17:12.628
I know he did.

01:17:14.194 --> 01:17:16.066
I can make him dead,
not just hurt.

01:17:17.894 --> 01:17:20.287
Please... sit.

01:17:26.816 --> 01:17:27.904
[groans]

01:17:27.947 --> 01:17:29.166
Sweet Mel...

01:17:31.472 --> 01:17:33.126
I am never...

01:17:33.170 --> 01:17:34.867
going to let anyone hurt you.

01:17:36.564 --> 01:17:38.175
Never again.

01:17:42.483 --> 01:17:44.137
It's me...

01:17:44.181 --> 01:17:46.139
[Mel whimpers]

01:17:46.183 --> 01:17:47.663
your secret admirer.

01:17:50.056 --> 01:17:52.668
We were in love...

01:17:52.711 --> 01:17:54.104
in college, remember?

01:17:56.019 --> 01:17:58.586
But we couldn't be a couple
because you were you.

01:18:02.373 --> 01:18:03.853
And I...

01:18:07.770 --> 01:18:09.902
Well...

01:18:09.946 --> 01:18:11.687
things weren't perfect.

01:18:14.211 --> 01:18:15.647
But now they are.

01:18:15.691 --> 01:18:17.605
You're crazy!

01:18:17.649 --> 01:18:20.434
[Mel whimpers, grunts]

01:18:20.478 --> 01:18:21.435
Stop!

01:18:22.567 --> 01:18:23.786
[exhales]

01:18:26.571 --> 01:18:28.399
You always have been a shy one.

01:18:31.794 --> 01:18:33.709
Hey...

01:18:33.752 --> 01:18:35.232
it's okay.

01:18:35.275 --> 01:18:37.974
[sighs, groans]

01:18:38.017 --> 01:18:40.933
You can't imagine what it was
like to be so lonely...

01:18:42.587 --> 01:18:45.242
wanting you all of these years.

01:18:46.765 --> 01:18:49.246
Well, of course,

01:18:49.289 --> 01:18:51.944
before we can be a couple...

01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:57.733
we have to be alone.

01:18:58.864 --> 01:19:00.300
- Never!
- [Trey grunts]

01:19:02.346 --> 01:19:04.130
[Mel panting]

01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:09.092
Okay.

01:19:09.135 --> 01:19:10.615
Okay, I got this.

01:19:10.658 --> 01:19:12.356
[exhales]

01:19:12.399 --> 01:19:14.010
[grunting]

01:19:18.275 --> 01:19:21.452
Shit. Okay.
Okay, I got this.

01:19:21.495 --> 01:19:23.323
[Mel grunting]

01:19:28.633 --> 01:19:31.288
[exhales sharply, chuckles]

01:19:33.290 --> 01:19:34.595
Okay.

01:19:35.422 --> 01:19:38.295
[Trey whistling]

01:19:50.176 --> 01:19:52.004
Why are you hiding from me, Mel?

01:19:55.921 --> 01:19:57.749
You're not making this
very easy.

01:20:04.364 --> 01:20:06.366
[Trey whispers]
Where are you, Mel?

01:20:08.455 --> 01:20:10.109
All right, Mel,
it's your choice.

01:20:12.111 --> 01:20:13.547
Back to Adam it is.

01:20:21.642 --> 01:20:24.123
Look at you.

01:20:24.167 --> 01:20:26.386
You think Mel
could ever be yours?

01:20:26.430 --> 01:20:28.345
You'll never have what we have.

01:20:30.477 --> 01:20:32.305
I remember the first moment
I fell for her.

01:20:36.962 --> 01:20:39.269
- Fall for me now.
- [Trey grunting]

01:20:47.581 --> 01:20:48.844
[Mel panting]

01:20:57.940 --> 01:20:59.245
[Mel grunting]

01:21:03.728 --> 01:21:05.469
It's over.

01:21:05.512 --> 01:21:07.079
- It's over.
- [groans]

01:21:07.123 --> 01:21:08.646
Can you walk?

01:21:08.689 --> 01:21:10.517
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.
- Okay, come on.

01:21:10.561 --> 01:21:12.389
Come on.

01:21:12.432 --> 01:21:15.000
- [Adam groans]
- All right. It's okay.

01:21:15.044 --> 01:21:16.784
It's okay.

01:21:16.828 --> 01:21:18.961
It's okay. It's okay.

01:21:20.353 --> 01:21:23.487
- Run.
- No. [grunts]

01:21:29.623 --> 01:21:30.624
Get the hell off me!

01:21:30.668 --> 01:21:31.712
[muffled screams]

01:21:31.756 --> 01:21:32.713
[shushing]

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:39.111
You think you can choose him?

01:21:39.155 --> 01:21:40.896
You're mine, Melissa.

01:21:41.984 --> 01:21:43.681
Forever.

01:21:43.724 --> 01:21:45.552
Forever and always.

01:21:45.596 --> 01:21:47.641
It's me and you, baby.

01:21:47.685 --> 01:21:50.253
That's it. Okay?

01:21:50.296 --> 01:21:51.515
- It's okay.
- [Mel grunts]

01:21:51.558 --> 01:21:53.865
[Mel gasps]

01:21:53.909 --> 01:21:56.172
Get off me! [grunts]

01:21:58.652 --> 01:22:00.393
[sirens wailing]

01:22:07.618 --> 01:22:09.446
[car door slams, radio chatter]

01:22:12.623 --> 01:22:13.580
[sighs]

01:22:23.721 --> 01:22:25.505
I know I've told you this
before,

01:22:25.549 --> 01:22:27.290
but beautiful job

01:22:27.333 --> 01:22:29.248
on the restoration.

01:22:29.292 --> 01:22:31.772
I mean, you can hardly believe
anything even happened here.

01:22:31.816 --> 01:22:33.818
Oh, thank you. I know.

01:22:33.861 --> 01:22:36.908
Well, you guys did
such a fantastic job, too.

01:22:36.952 --> 01:22:40.564
I mean, my security system
can now rival NASA.

01:22:40.607 --> 01:22:42.000
Oh, I will take that.

01:22:42.044 --> 01:22:44.481
- Mm-hmm.
- [Leslie chuckles]

01:22:44.524 --> 01:22:48.050
So, uh, he got five years, huh?

01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:52.750
Can we not talk about Trey?

01:22:52.793 --> 01:22:56.014
You're right.
Old news, old news.

01:22:56.058 --> 01:22:58.669
To you and this
beautiful gallery.

01:22:58.712 --> 01:23:00.627
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:23:00.671 --> 01:23:02.542
[Mel gasps] Hey, sweetie.

01:23:02.586 --> 01:23:03.761
Hey, gorgeous.

01:23:04.892 --> 01:23:06.155
Oh...

01:23:06.198 --> 01:23:07.112
[Adam] Brought you some flowers.

01:23:07.156 --> 01:23:08.548
Thank you.

01:23:08.592 --> 01:23:10.594
- Your mail's there too.
- Oh, thank you.

01:23:12.988 --> 01:23:15.120
Ooh, ooh! Oops.

01:23:15.164 --> 01:23:16.600
[Mel chuckles]

01:23:16.643 --> 01:23:17.905
[Leslie] Mel...

01:23:21.822 --> 01:23:23.085
What is this?

01:23:23.128 --> 01:23:25.870
Don't freak out,
it's an everyday thing.

01:23:25.913 --> 01:23:27.306
You're not concerned?

01:23:29.613 --> 01:23:31.180
Not in the least.

01:23:33.486 --> 01:23:36.359
[Trey humming]

01:23:39.101 --> 01:23:42.017
[Trey whistling]

01:23:52.418 --> 01:23:55.291
[Trey humming]

01:23:57.467 --> 01:24:00.339
[Trey whistling]

01:24:11.785 --> 01:24:14.440
[whistling continues]
