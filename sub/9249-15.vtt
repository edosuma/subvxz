WEBVTT

00:03.421 --> 00:05.055
50 pounds down.

00:05.056 --> 00:08.157
It's been ten years since I've
been able to slip into these.

00:08.159 --> 00:10.861
I'm so proud of you. Maybe-maybe
hop a little. Okay, okay.

00:10.862 --> 00:13.297
I'll hop, you pull. Ready?
Yeah, yeah.

00:13.298 --> 00:15.565
(grunting)

00:15.566 --> 00:18.235
Yeah!

00:18.236 --> 00:21.738
There he is.
Hello, sexy.

00:21.739 --> 00:22.939
Hold on. We're not
out of the woods yet.

00:22.940 --> 00:24.207
I still got to zip.
Ooh, ooh!

00:24.208 --> 00:26.043
Lay on the bed.
I'll grab some pliers.

00:26.044 --> 00:27.377
Wait.

00:27.378 --> 00:29.212
Yeah!

00:29.213 --> 00:30.681
(imitating Rocky):
Ain't gonna be no rematch.

00:30.682 --> 00:32.883
Ain't gonna be no rematch!

00:32.884 --> 00:35.619
Oh. I bought these a decade ago

00:35.620 --> 00:37.621
after a both-ends stomach flu.

00:37.622 --> 00:40.157
It nearly killed me,
but I never looked better.

00:40.158 --> 00:41.758
Until now.

00:41.759 --> 00:43.994
You know, it's not everybody
that can wear their flu pants.

00:43.995 --> 00:46.163
And you did it the hard way.
Yep.

00:46.164 --> 00:48.231
Diet and exercise.
I did more of the things I hate

00:48.232 --> 00:50.767
and ate less of the things
I love.

00:50.768 --> 00:52.569
Well, let's go show you off.
Where to first?

00:52.570 --> 00:55.339
I don't know. Maybe try walking
down the stairs. Go from there.

00:55.340 --> 00:57.107
Great.

00:57.108 --> 00:59.710
Ooh! Right behind you.

00:59.711 --> 01:02.912
If my ass wasn't numb, I would
have really enjoyed that.

01:35.439 --> 01:37.340
I never thought I'd see the day.

01:37.341 --> 01:40.609
Mike Biggs outrunning
and apprehending a crook.

01:40.611 --> 01:43.679
It's not my first
foot pursuit, Carl.

01:43.681 --> 01:45.215
Yeah, but it's the first time
that you didn't quit

01:45.216 --> 01:48.283
after half a block and throw
your nightstick at the guy.

01:48.285 --> 01:50.954
I'll admit, two blocks in,
I was ready to quit.

01:50.955 --> 01:53.423
But when I realized he wasn't
gonna drop that 50-inch plasma,

01:53.424 --> 01:55.959
I knew I had him.

01:55.960 --> 01:59.062
Welcome to Abe's,
home of the hot beef.

01:59.063 --> 02:01.498
Can I interest you gentlemen
in some mozzarella sticks

02:01.499 --> 02:03.732
while you decide on your order?

02:07.204 --> 02:09.905
Why do you sound like a waiter?

02:09.907 --> 02:12.876
I'm not just a waiter, I am
a part-owner of this restaurant,

02:12.877 --> 02:15.979
which means providing you
with a quality dining experience

02:15.980 --> 02:17.280
while turning you upside down

02:17.281 --> 02:20.215
and shaking every penny
from your pocket.

02:22.219 --> 02:23.852
Metaphorically, in your case.

02:25.923 --> 02:27.524
So, your mozzarella sticks.

02:27.525 --> 02:29.858
Ranch or marinara?

02:29.860 --> 02:31.828
Not so quick.

02:31.829 --> 02:33.395
How come I can't have both?

02:33.397 --> 02:35.864
You sly fox. Two it is.

02:37.768 --> 02:40.069
What are you doing? Can't you
see you're being manipulated?

02:40.071 --> 02:42.104
Make sure to save room for
our delicious apple pie.

02:42.106 --> 02:44.707
Ooh, now, that sounds tempting.

02:44.709 --> 02:46.476
Seriously? I thought
you declared your mouth

02:46.477 --> 02:48.911
a no-pie zone.

02:48.913 --> 02:51.181
Aw, one cheat in six months
isn't gonna kill me.

02:51.182 --> 02:53.048
It's not like I'm having
ice cream on it.

02:53.050 --> 02:54.083
For only a dollar more, you can.

02:54.085 --> 02:56.285
Deal.

03:06.330 --> 03:08.997
That can't be right.

03:14.338 --> 03:18.140
Damn it! One piece of pie
can't weigh five pounds!

03:18.142 --> 03:20.342
You ruin everything!

03:23.314 --> 03:25.315
Oh, that smells so good.

03:25.316 --> 03:27.717
Yeah, egg white scramble.
Pretty amazing.

03:27.718 --> 03:30.286
Just with a little, you know,
grilled onion, spinach,

03:30.287 --> 03:32.622
tomato, mushroom, salt, pepper,

03:32.623 --> 03:34.357
garlic, bay seasoning, you know,

03:34.358 --> 03:37.459
you can really make it taste
like something.

03:37.461 --> 03:39.529
You still got the yolks?
When we get back from the walk,

03:39.530 --> 03:42.265
I might make
a nice breakfast custard.

03:42.266 --> 03:43.767
You'll do no such thing.

03:43.768 --> 03:46.569
You're gonna start eating right,
like Mikey's been doing.

03:46.570 --> 03:49.271
Can't argue with the results.
Look at this guy.

03:49.273 --> 03:50.940
I can just about Heimlich you.

03:50.941 --> 03:52.674
Get off.
What?

03:52.676 --> 03:53.910
I'm impressed.

03:53.911 --> 03:56.745
You went from a cautionary tale
to a role model.

03:56.747 --> 03:59.849
He sure did.
He's my biggest loser.

03:59.850 --> 04:03.386
Look, uh, I realize I still
have a ways to go, okay?

04:03.387 --> 04:04.419
What, are you kiddin' me?

04:04.421 --> 04:06.256
You finally got a handle
on things.

04:06.257 --> 04:08.324
When I first met you,
I thought, "Holy moly,

04:08.325 --> 04:11.460
it's like a weather balloon
wearing shoes."

04:12.563 --> 04:15.531
Mom, go walk him. Please.

04:16.666 --> 04:17.699
What'd I say?

04:17.701 --> 04:19.302
Let's go, boy.

04:19.303 --> 04:23.372
Why can't people take
compliments in this house?

04:23.374 --> 04:24.641
Here you go.

04:24.642 --> 04:25.975
Uh, no, thanks, honey.

04:25.976 --> 04:27.877
I-I think I'm gonna skip
breakfast this morning.

04:27.878 --> 04:29.645
Oh, come on.
Don't listen to Vince.

04:29.647 --> 04:30.880
If he's not saying
something dumb,

04:30.881 --> 04:33.282
he's saying something stupid.

04:33.284 --> 04:34.417
No, it's not him.

04:34.418 --> 04:35.919
I just don't feel
like eating, okay?

04:35.920 --> 04:37.786
Fine.

04:37.788 --> 04:39.289
You don't know
what you're missing.

04:39.290 --> 04:41.623
(hesitantly): Mmm...

04:44.428 --> 04:46.729
You really don't.

04:46.730 --> 04:48.263
(chuckles)

04:55.339 --> 04:57.707
WOMAN: Number 36.

04:57.708 --> 05:00.275
(sighs) Number 37.

05:00.277 --> 05:03.313
Have you seen those screaming
goats on the Internet? Yeah.

05:03.314 --> 05:05.481
(mimics screaming goat)

05:05.482 --> 05:07.983
Sound like a damn human being.

05:07.985 --> 05:10.386
(mimics screaming goat)

05:10.387 --> 05:12.821
Really unsettling.

05:12.823 --> 05:13.923
I don't mean
to get philosophical,

05:13.924 --> 05:15.757
but it goes against God.

05:15.759 --> 05:18.627
(mimics screaming goat)
I got it. I got it.

05:18.629 --> 05:20.029
You know what,
you are in a mood, man.

05:20.030 --> 05:21.396
You should have
just ordered something.

05:21.398 --> 05:23.699
I did. Green tea with lemon.

05:23.701 --> 05:25.101
Y-You skipped breakfast
this morning,

05:25.102 --> 05:27.337
y-you're skipping lunch now...
man, that's not healthy.

05:27.338 --> 05:28.404
You know what's not healthy?

05:28.405 --> 05:30.740
A body that turns
nine ounces of pie

05:30.741 --> 05:33.709
into five pounds
of fat overnight.

05:33.711 --> 05:35.111
WOMAN: Number 42!

05:35.112 --> 05:36.679
Right here.

05:36.680 --> 05:39.649
You had to have lunch
in Chinatown, didn't you?

05:39.650 --> 05:41.417
It smells so good
I could go Godzilla

05:41.418 --> 05:44.020
on the whole neighborhood.

05:44.021 --> 05:45.722
No, he's actually Japanese.
But I'm gonna let that go

05:45.723 --> 05:47.623
'cause I like the imagery.

05:47.625 --> 05:49.859
Oh.
(inhales deeply)

05:49.860 --> 05:51.760
Four dollars for all of this.

05:51.762 --> 05:54.597
I mean, even if the chicken is
pigeon, you can't beat that price.

05:54.598 --> 05:55.564
Sure you don't want any?

05:55.566 --> 05:57.299
What do you think?
Of course I do.

05:57.301 --> 05:58.368
Well, man, grab some chopsticks.

05:58.369 --> 06:00.235
Carl, I am trying
so hard to stay on track.

06:00.237 --> 06:02.271
Can you just support
me in this, please?

06:02.273 --> 06:04.674
What are you worried about?
You're doing great.

06:04.675 --> 06:07.143
I am so sick of people saying
that... I am <i>not</i> doing great.

06:07.144 --> 06:08.578
I'm barely holding on.

06:08.579 --> 06:10.647
If I let my guard down,
50 pounds will come back

06:10.648 --> 06:12.347
just like that.
Mm-mm.

06:12.349 --> 06:14.917
Mm-mm. Not while
I'm watching your back.

06:14.919 --> 06:17.954
The key is not putting yourself
in the position

06:17.955 --> 06:19.122
where you can be tempted.

06:19.123 --> 06:21.523
Mm... hold this
while I get my soy sauce.

06:25.763 --> 06:27.230
WOMAN: Number 44!

06:27.231 --> 06:29.364
Man, these things
are persnickety.

06:36.173 --> 06:39.841
Whew. Look at this.

06:39.843 --> 06:42.946
I am moo goo gai full.

06:42.947 --> 06:44.447
I don't want to hear it.

06:44.448 --> 06:46.482
You'll burn off half
that walking to the toilet

06:46.483 --> 06:49.184
to crap out what hasn't
already turned to muscle.

06:49.186 --> 06:52.487
If nothing else, I am regular.

06:52.489 --> 06:53.856
I could sew my lips shut

06:53.857 --> 06:56.291
and still never have a body
like yours.

06:56.293 --> 06:58.061
Yeah, well, I'll never have
your beautiful blue eyes

06:58.062 --> 06:59.995
and a full head of hair...
everybody's different, Mike.

06:59.997 --> 07:01.764
Yeah, well,
I drew the fat straw.

07:01.765 --> 07:04.367
(chuckles) You sure
you drew just one?

07:04.368 --> 07:07.102
Back off, Seely.
I'm not in the mood.

07:07.104 --> 07:08.471
All right. Take it easy.

07:08.472 --> 07:11.441
For your information,
my man lost 50 pounds.

07:11.442 --> 07:14.310
Hey! That's great, Biggs!

07:14.311 --> 07:16.712
I thought you went down
a cup size.

07:16.714 --> 07:20.183
Whoa, take... I'm just
playing with you.

07:20.184 --> 07:23.720
Just playing.
You look great.

07:23.721 --> 07:26.389
In fact, if this were the fair,
I'd give you a blue ribbon.

07:26.390 --> 07:28.624
What is it you need?

07:28.625 --> 07:30.693
Don't listen to him.
He's not worth it.

07:30.694 --> 07:32.594
Just go home.

07:32.596 --> 07:34.330
I got to get changed first.

07:34.331 --> 07:35.932
Yeah, I'm fine, Carl.

07:35.933 --> 07:37.400
All right.

07:37.401 --> 07:39.101
You just keep your mouth shut.

07:39.103 --> 07:40.603
Well, tell that to your partner.

07:40.604 --> 07:43.171
'Cause I think
that's his problem.

07:44.575 --> 07:47.309
Now, now who has a problem?

07:47.311 --> 07:48.910
You do, man!

08:04.845 --> 08:06.379
He had it coming.

08:06.380 --> 08:08.347
I'm not talking to you.

08:08.349 --> 08:10.816
What the hell were you thinking?

08:10.818 --> 08:13.286
You heard the guy.
What was I supposed to do?

08:13.287 --> 08:14.821
What half the precinct
does: ignore that fool

08:14.822 --> 08:16.890
and then sleep with his wife.

08:16.891 --> 08:19.359
I'm sorry. Seely deserved
to get his butt kicked.

08:19.360 --> 08:20.760
Yeah, well, congratulations.

08:20.761 --> 08:23.596
Your heroics earned you a date
with the police psychologist

08:23.597 --> 08:25.598
and a three-day suspension.
I thought I'd get at least

08:25.599 --> 08:29.369
two weeks... boy, even
the captain hates that jackass.

08:29.370 --> 08:31.037
Is this the new Mike Biggs? Hmm?

08:31.038 --> 08:32.739
Starves himself and then
when somebody annoys him,

08:32.740 --> 08:34.073
comes out swinging?

08:34.073 --> 08:35.607
I was just a little cranky.

08:35.609 --> 08:36.842
Because you didn't eat.

08:36.844 --> 08:38.244
Like an idiot.

08:38.245 --> 08:40.580
And I still haven't eaten yet.

08:40.581 --> 08:42.081
Oh, so you're
threatening me now?

08:42.082 --> 08:43.650
You know I would never hit you.

08:43.650 --> 08:45.084
Oh, you wouldn't hit me?

08:45.085 --> 08:47.353
(mimics screaming goat)
How 'bout now?

08:47.354 --> 08:50.089
(mimics screaming goat)
What about now?

08:50.090 --> 08:51.057
(mimics screaming goat)

08:51.058 --> 08:52.859
Knock it off!

08:52.860 --> 08:54.928
Man, just have a hard-boiled
egg or something.

08:54.929 --> 08:57.095
I want my Mike back.

09:00.401 --> 09:01.901
There you are.

09:01.902 --> 09:03.036
Hey.

09:03.037 --> 09:04.604
You're late.
I was getting worried.

09:04.605 --> 09:06.606
Yeah...

09:06.607 --> 09:07.774
Everything okay?

09:07.775 --> 09:09.442
Uh...

09:09.443 --> 09:11.477
I have something to tell you.

09:11.478 --> 09:14.113
Okay...

09:14.114 --> 09:17.550
I have tomorrow off!

09:17.551 --> 09:19.986
Really? What's the occasion?

09:19.987 --> 09:20.954
Oh, no occasion.

09:20.955 --> 09:23.456
It was actually
the captain's idea.

09:23.457 --> 09:26.826
So he's just handing
out days off now?

09:26.827 --> 09:28.928
Guess he was in a good mood.

09:28.929 --> 09:32.498
He said take tomorrow off
and the next day and...

09:32.499 --> 09:34.467
Three days, tops.

09:34.468 --> 09:37.737
Mike, I know what's
really going on.

09:37.738 --> 09:40.238
You do?
Ugh. Budget cuts.

09:40.240 --> 09:42.942
They used to do that to us
when I was still teaching.

09:42.943 --> 09:44.911
Suggested furloughs.

09:44.912 --> 09:46.512
Nothing gets by you.

09:46.513 --> 09:50.183
You know, boy,
that really chaps my cheeks.

09:50.184 --> 09:52.885
You know, how about instead of
cutting back on the police,

09:52.886 --> 09:54.587
you call up some of
the mayor's cronies

09:54.588 --> 09:56.990
and tell them to take
a couple of days off.

09:56.991 --> 10:00.393
What are you gonna do? You can't
fight city hall. Well, watch me.

10:00.394 --> 10:02.161
Wait, wait, what are you doing?

10:02.162 --> 10:03.663
Well, I'm standing up
for my husband

10:03.664 --> 10:06.264
in a very nasty
e-mail to the mayor's office.

10:06.266 --> 10:08.334
No, no, no, no, no, no,
please don't do that. Mike...

10:08.335 --> 10:09.335
you're too nice.

10:09.336 --> 10:10.903
You let people
walk all over you.

10:10.904 --> 10:12.872
Sometimes you got to fight back.

10:12.873 --> 10:15.140
Yeah.

10:22.182 --> 10:23.850
Morning.
Morning.

10:23.851 --> 10:25.184
Have you seen Mike?

10:25.185 --> 10:26.285
He already left.

10:26.286 --> 10:27.787
Said he had some errands to run.

10:27.788 --> 10:30.223
Really? I thought for sure
he was gonna sleep in.

10:30.224 --> 10:32.892
Must want to make the most
out of his day off.

10:32.893 --> 10:34.127
Day off?

10:34.128 --> 10:36.162
I like that.
Puts a positive spin

10:36.163 --> 10:39.098
on such a difficult situation.

10:39.099 --> 10:42.468
What's that?
You know.

10:42.469 --> 10:43.403
You don't know.

10:43.404 --> 10:44.437
Never mind.

10:44.438 --> 10:45.672
Let's do this again.

10:45.673 --> 10:47.173
Morning!

10:47.174 --> 10:48.174
Nuh-uh.

10:48.175 --> 10:49.976
You're supposed
to say "morning."

10:49.977 --> 10:51.644
No. What is going on?

10:51.645 --> 10:53.713
I thought I was saying something
Carl told me that you knew,

10:53.714 --> 10:54.747
but now I know you don't know,

10:54.748 --> 10:56.149
so I shouldn't say.

10:56.150 --> 10:58.083
You know?

10:59.169 --> 11:00.570
Victoria...
Hmm...

11:00.571 --> 11:04.240
I probably already know
what you think I don't know,

11:04.241 --> 11:07.910
so you should probably
just let me know.

11:07.911 --> 11:09.978
You know?

11:09.980 --> 11:12.215
So you heard about Mike punching

11:12.216 --> 11:14.049
that other officer
and then getting suspended?

11:14.051 --> 11:16.819
What?!
You told me that you knew.

11:16.820 --> 11:18.321
All right, tell me everything.

11:18.322 --> 11:19.722
Carl is gonna kill me.

11:19.723 --> 11:21.324
Well, you should've thought
of that before you started

11:21.325 --> 11:23.725
saying "morning," you know?

11:30.601 --> 11:32.001
I'm looking for Dr. Jeffries.

11:32.002 --> 11:33.269
I have an 11:00.

11:33.270 --> 11:35.438
You found the right place.
Come on in.

11:35.439 --> 11:37.639
Okay.

11:40.611 --> 11:42.145
Should I sit here?

11:42.146 --> 11:44.279
It's either there or on my lap.

11:51.622 --> 11:53.955
How does this work?

11:53.957 --> 11:55.692
Well, we start out
by finding your file.

11:55.693 --> 11:56.892
(wry chuckle)

12:01.365 --> 12:02.832
Heroin problem...?!

12:02.833 --> 12:05.768
Uh, no, no... punched a cop. Oh,

12:05.769 --> 12:07.270
right, right, right, right.

12:07.271 --> 12:08.905
Uh, here we go.
(chuckles)

12:08.906 --> 12:11.106
Biggs, not Briggs.

12:12.609 --> 12:16.145
Briggs has a heroin problem?

12:16.146 --> 12:18.648
That's confidential.

12:18.649 --> 12:21.416
And please don't
tell anybody I told you.

12:23.087 --> 12:25.321
I see here you...
you hit a fellow officer.

12:25.322 --> 12:27.422
Yeah, and I know
I shouldn't have done it,

12:27.424 --> 12:30.226
but in my defense, this guy... Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Let me stop you right here.

12:30.227 --> 12:31.828
We're on the same side here.

12:31.829 --> 12:33.596
And in the same union, huh?

12:33.597 --> 12:35.531
This is how it works.

12:35.532 --> 12:37.266
You're not gonna
do this again, are you?

12:37.267 --> 12:39.334
No, sir.
Great.

12:42.306 --> 12:43.840
That's it?

12:43.841 --> 12:45.074
No, no, no, no, no.

12:45.075 --> 12:47.275
Technically, you have
to sit here for an hour.

12:50.447 --> 12:51.914
Do we have to talk?

12:51.915 --> 12:54.117
That's up to you.
You want to talk?

12:54.118 --> 12:56.351
No.
There you go.

12:59.590 --> 13:01.057
I mean, since
we're not gonna talk,

13:01.058 --> 13:02.825
do you mind
if I update your file?

13:02.826 --> 13:03.993
No, go ahead.

13:03.994 --> 13:05.561
Uh, just remember,
it's-it's, uh, Biggs,

13:05.562 --> 13:07.729
not-not Briggs.

13:09.566 --> 13:12.467
You really got to keep
that under your hat, okay?

13:19.743 --> 13:22.477
Boy, I was so nervous about
coming here. (chuckles)

13:27.384 --> 13:28.851
Is that your wife?

13:28.852 --> 13:30.887
Yep.
Very pretty.

13:30.888 --> 13:32.355
I'm married, too.

13:32.356 --> 13:33.589
Great girl.

13:33.590 --> 13:34.891
Be glad she's not here.

13:34.892 --> 13:36.492
Boy, she's a talker.

13:36.493 --> 13:38.660
They all are.

13:41.698 --> 13:43.299
You know what
the funny thing is?

13:43.300 --> 13:45.835
I-I don't know why I didn't
tell her about all this.

13:45.836 --> 13:47.570
I guess I was just
embarrassed, you know?

13:47.571 --> 13:50.406
She's... She's been
so proud of me lately.

13:50.407 --> 13:51.774
And I don't know if it says
it in my file,

13:51.775 --> 13:53.209
but I've lost over 50 pounds.

13:53.210 --> 13:57.413
That is, until I slipped up
and had that one cheat day.

13:57.414 --> 13:59.281
Is that right?

13:59.283 --> 14:02.684
Why do I always go to food
for my reward?

14:03.520 --> 14:05.087
I hate to say it, but...

14:05.088 --> 14:07.690
it's usually the mother,
isn't it?

14:07.691 --> 14:09.025
Not always.

14:09.026 --> 14:11.993
But I know I hate mine.

14:16.200 --> 14:19.602
I remember I was 16 when
Dad left us high and dry.

14:19.603 --> 14:21.704
I was devastated.

14:21.705 --> 14:23.206
How did Mom make it better?

14:23.207 --> 14:25.942
With a pork tenderloin sandwich
from Lucky's.

14:25.943 --> 14:28.711
Yeah, the patty's
bigger than the bun.

14:28.712 --> 14:31.380
That man was my hero.

14:31.381 --> 14:32.747
Lucky?

14:34.117 --> 14:35.517
No, my father.

14:36.420 --> 14:38.421
I mean,
who leaves their son at 16?

14:38.422 --> 14:41.724
Right when a boy needs
the most help becoming a man.

14:41.725 --> 14:43.459
You know,
I was always a big kid,

14:43.460 --> 14:45.127
but, boy, when he left,
I just...

14:45.128 --> 14:47.329
I really ballooned.

14:48.899 --> 14:50.566
You know, I have
a lunch after this.

14:50.567 --> 14:53.369
But I could cancel it if you
want to explore this further.

14:53.370 --> 14:57.138
Explore what?
I'm just sitting here.

15:05.782 --> 15:08.951
So, how was your day off?

15:08.952 --> 15:10.586
I didn't have the day off.

15:10.587 --> 15:13.521
Don't lie to me, Mike, I know
you didn't have the day off.

15:14.691 --> 15:17.225
That's what I just said.
We need to talk.

15:17.227 --> 15:19.427
Not until we talk...
wait a minute, what?

15:20.631 --> 15:22.632
All right, now you're m...
you're messing me up here.

15:22.633 --> 15:24.833
Sit.

15:26.169 --> 15:27.436
(sighs)

15:27.437 --> 15:28.804
Molly...

15:28.805 --> 15:31.474
I am barely holding on here.

15:31.475 --> 15:33.976
Honey, what's going on with you?

15:33.977 --> 15:35.678
When does it stop?

15:35.679 --> 15:36.946
What?

15:36.947 --> 15:38.347
This!

15:38.348 --> 15:40.016
When do I have to stop
worrying about

15:40.017 --> 15:42.551
every single thing
I put in my mouth?

15:42.552 --> 15:45.054
I don't know.

15:45.055 --> 15:46.522
It's not fair.

15:46.523 --> 15:49.292
No. It's not.

15:49.293 --> 15:51.260
I-I feel like the world
looks at me

15:51.261 --> 15:52.995
like this fat, lazy guy,
when actually,

15:52.996 --> 15:55.364
I am working so hard.

15:55.365 --> 15:57.633
Hey, I know how hard
you're working.

15:57.634 --> 15:58.834
And you know it, too.

15:58.835 --> 16:00.836
And-And that's all
that really matters.

16:00.837 --> 16:02.872
And most days,
I'm good with that.

16:02.873 --> 16:05.241
But some days...

16:05.242 --> 16:07.543
ah, it just gets to me.

16:07.544 --> 16:09.912
I know.

16:09.913 --> 16:12.747
Still doesn't mean you can
go around punching people.

16:14.518 --> 16:18.087
Not people. Seely.
(chuckles): Okay.

16:18.088 --> 16:20.022
Listen...

16:20.023 --> 16:22.625
you and I are doing really well.

16:22.626 --> 16:25.094
And I want you to
be happy about that.

16:25.095 --> 16:26.662
I'm trying to be.
Well...

16:26.663 --> 16:29.131
try harder.

16:29.132 --> 16:31.500
You're in a good place
and I-I want you

16:31.501 --> 16:33.502
to enjoy the moment.

16:33.503 --> 16:36.604
Last time I enjoyed the moment,
I gained five pounds.

16:38.542 --> 16:40.710
As long as there's pie,
I'm not safe.

16:40.711 --> 16:44.179
No. As long as there's me,
you are.

16:50.721 --> 16:53.822
I wish I hadn't sent
that nasty letter to the mayor.

16:56.360 --> 16:58.661
Well, if he writes you back,
say it was a typo,

16:58.662 --> 17:00.229
and you're married
to an Officer Briggs.

17:00.230 --> 17:01.931
That guy's all messed up.

17:01.932 --> 17:03.732
Okay. Nice.

17:15.604 --> 17:18.605
Would anyone else like to share?

17:21.742 --> 17:24.310
Boy, Mike looks great.

17:24.311 --> 17:25.813
Oh, you should tell him.

17:25.814 --> 17:27.281
I bet he'd like to hear that.

17:27.281 --> 17:28.748
Looking good, Mike Biggs!

17:29.970 --> 17:32.653
I didn't mean now.

17:32.654 --> 17:35.689
Uh... Hi, my name is Mike.
I'm an overeater.

17:35.690 --> 17:37.391
ALL: Hi, Mike. It's, uh...

17:37.392 --> 17:39.427
It's been a while
since my last share.

17:39.428 --> 17:42.196
And this is usually the point
where I would tell you how much

17:42.197 --> 17:45.966
weight I've lost, but, uh,
I'm not gonna do that.

17:45.967 --> 17:49.670
Because it's not about
how much I weigh,

17:49.671 --> 17:51.672
it's about how I feel.

17:51.673 --> 17:53.707
And today...

17:53.708 --> 17:56.577
I feel pretty damn good.

17:56.578 --> 17:58.778
Feeling good, looking good!

18:00.315 --> 18:02.016
Okay, Harry.

18:02.017 --> 18:03.684
That doesn't mean

18:03.685 --> 18:06.153
I'm gonna feel great tomorrow,
you know?

18:06.154 --> 18:08.456
But I'm gonna keep
taking it one day at a time,

18:08.457 --> 18:10.524
because e-every day...

18:10.525 --> 18:12.460
it's a battle.

18:12.461 --> 18:15.863
You know?
And sometimes the pie wins.

18:15.864 --> 18:19.200
But the thing is...

18:19.201 --> 18:22.002
you gotta keep fighting.

18:22.003 --> 18:23.770
Thanks for letting me share.
