01:06.148 --> 01:08.805
Mm! Smells good, Kryten. What is it?

01:08.840 --> 01:11.216
Something I caught scuttling
around the cargo bay, sir...

01:11.217 --> 01:13.837
managed to land a monkey wrench
on it, and the rest is history!

01:14.844 --> 01:16.610
'Scuttling thing, a la monkey wrench'?

01:16.611 --> 01:20.839
Kryten, nothing I'm prepared to eat has ever
scuttled. This mouth is a scuttle-free zone.

01:21.834 --> 01:23.802
It does smell good though, what is it?

01:23.837 --> 01:26.838
Ah, the only clue I'm prepared to give,
sir, is: we're having it with green wine...

01:27.834 --> 01:28.834
It's space weevil, isn't it...

01:29.835 --> 01:30.799
It is not, no, sir.

01:30.834 --> 01:36.302
Look, the rule is simple: I will not eat
any animal that has ever been a cartoon.

01:36.303 --> 01:40.637
Weevils, rabbits, dogs, cats,
mice, road-runners; all out.

01:40.838 --> 01:41.837
I'm not a cartoonivore!

01:43.837 --> 01:45.802
- Ta-daa!
- Lobster!

01:45.837 --> 01:49.832
Poached, in a delicate cream sauce, sir.
Little so-en-so escaped in the hold.

01:49.867 --> 01:51.799
Where did you get a live lobster?

01:51.834 --> 01:53.839
The S.S. Centauri, they had
four in their stasis block.

01:55.836 --> 01:57.840
You've really gone to a lot of
trouble over this, haven't you...

01:59.833 --> 02:00.844
You don't know what day it is, do you, sir?

02:00.879 --> 02:02.800
- Today? Someone's birthday?
- Nope.

02:02.835 --> 02:03.802
- Christmas? Easter?
- Nope.

02:03.837 --> 02:05.832
National Have Something
That Scuttles For Dinner day?

02:05.867 --> 02:06.801
No.

02:06.836 --> 02:07.799
Well, what then?

02:07.834 --> 02:09.912
Today is the day that you
rescued me from the Nova 5

02:10.413 --> 02:11.833
I thought we should have
a surprise celebration!

02:12.836 --> 02:13.830
I had no idea! Why didn't you say?

02:14.833 --> 02:17.794
Ahh, if you'd said, it wouldn't
have been much of a surprise, right?

02:17.829 --> 02:20.150
Prescisely, sir, it would
have been about as unsurprising

02:20.151 --> 02:21.830
as an episode of Tales
Of The Unexpected.

02:22.830 --> 02:23.799
Eh?

02:23.834 --> 02:29.830
The old Channel 72 show.
It was... Everyone... Never mind.

02:30.831 --> 02:32.830
Okay everyone? Ready? Let's go!

02:32.865 --> 02:33.798
Go?

02:33.833 --> 02:35.726
We're going to the
Artificial Reality suite!

02:36.227 --> 02:38.796
We just loaded in that new software
we picked up from the S.S. Centauri.

02:39.431 --> 02:42.591
Can you believe the luck? Finding
a working copy of Jane Austin world?

02:43.126 --> 02:44.578
It's the luckiest find
I've made since I discovered

02:44.579 --> 02:45.834
that tube of leg-wax
under the medi-scanner.

02:46.832 --> 02:47.832
You found my leg-wax?

02:48.830 --> 02:52.795
We're going to visit 'Pride And
Prejudice' land. This is gonna be so great!

02:52.830 --> 02:57.832
It's Chick City, bud! Five sisters and
they're all hotter than a Mustang's exhaust!

02:57.867 --> 03:00.944
And you're going to go with them,
sir? This is... It's unbelievable.

03:05.074 --> 03:07.809
I just thought I'd check it out...
Y'know, I never had much of an education,

03:07.810 --> 03:09.727
what with being and orphan,
and going to art college.

03:10.228 --> 03:11.076
Thought I might learn something here.

03:11.093 --> 03:14.094
Oh, just stick it in the oven, come and
join us and we'll have it when we get back!

03:15.096 --> 03:17.097
Two days I've spent, preparing this!

03:18.094 --> 03:21.094
Kryten, I've gotta go, man,
they're waiting for me. I'm sorry.

03:22.096 --> 03:28.096
I don't know why I bother. Gallivanting
off like that! And on our aniversary too!

03:33.094 --> 03:34.822
'Pride and Prejudice' world!

03:35.823 --> 03:38.391
When I was fourteen in Cyberschool
I used to spend all my time here.

03:39.102 --> 03:42.101
These strides are too tackle-tight,
Officer B-B. I can barely cruise!

03:43.099 --> 03:46.070
Look, just try and appreciate
the nuances and culture.

03:46.105 --> 03:50.104
I'm tryin', but it's real hard when
there's a seam splicing your nadgers in two!

03:51.107 --> 03:52.099
You're gonna spoil it for us, aren't you...

03:53.097 --> 03:54.098
No he won't, he'll be fine.

03:54.099 --> 03:56.767
Look man, all clothes were a bit
nadger-restricting back in them days.

03:56.768 --> 03:58.102
That's why there were so many wars.

03:59.102 --> 04:00.840
Okay? Let's interact
with the characters,

04:00.841 --> 04:04.108
then perhaps you can begin to understand
why the book is such a masterpiece..?

04:07.100 --> 04:12.095
Ah! Good morning, Mrs Bennett.
Is it not a most fine day?

04:13.097 --> 04:15.098
'Tis an utter delight and no mistake.

04:16.106 --> 04:20.099
Oh, we don't believe we've had the pleasure
of meeting your handsome young friends..?

04:24.124 --> 04:27.124
This is Mr Lister, and his friend Mr Cat.

04:30.126 --> 04:34.287
Perhaps you would like to join
us on a turn around the forest,

04:34.288 --> 04:37.127
and later have tea in
Mr Pindley's gazebo?

04:38.124 --> 04:39.125
Oh please, ma-ma, can they come?

04:40.125 --> 04:41.124
May they, oh, that would be so delightful!

04:42.124 --> 04:46.136
Oh yes, oh, please! Oh do! Do
come to tea, oh please, please!

04:47.126 --> 04:49.122
They're so hot they're steamin'!

04:53.123 --> 04:56.100
"Cook it", "don't cook
it", "do this", "do that"!

04:56.101 --> 04:57.929
Well, I'm sorry, I'm gonna make you eat

04:57.930 --> 05:00.132
this damn supper if
it's the last thing I do!

05:40.119 --> 05:42.803
Just borrow the T-72
from the WW2 game...

05:42.804 --> 05:46.125
and then I think we'll
have everyone's attention...

05:51.124 --> 05:54.362
Where on earth have Dame
Lizzie and Jane disappeared to?

05:54.363 --> 05:56.123
Such rudeness! I'm most vexed!

05:57.128 --> 05:59.123
Never mind, Mrs Bennett,
I'm sure they'll be...

06:13.122 --> 06:16.124
Perhaps I didn't make myself
clear? I said: 'supper is ready'!

06:27.116 --> 06:31.117
Is anyone still unclear as to the
supper situation? No? Excellent.

06:33.117 --> 06:35.118
I didn't know robots got PMT!

06:41.120 --> 06:43.119
It's nice, Kryts, really nice.

06:43.283 --> 06:44.083
It's really great.

06:44.118 --> 06:46.116
In fact, it's better
than nice, it's fantastic.

06:46.151 --> 06:47.133
Isn't it great?

06:47.168 --> 06:48.615
- It's really great.
- Really, really great.

06:50.117 --> 06:51.121
Are we eating the same stuff?

06:54.115 --> 06:58.285
I don't know why I make the effort. No one
appreciates the hours I put into food prep!

06:58.286 --> 07:01.113
My fingers are practically
worn down to the endo-skeleton.

07:01.718 --> 07:02.718
Is there any ketchup?

07:03.114 --> 07:04.119
Any what?

07:05.115 --> 07:08.119
Ketchup. I just thought it
could do with a bit of ketchup...

07:08.154 --> 07:09.112
Just a dollop..?

07:09.147 --> 07:10.422
- Ketchup?
- Oh my god...

07:11.124 --> 07:12.078
You want ketchup?

07:12.113 --> 07:16.116
Errm... brown! Not tomato! Brown!
It's not like I've got no class...

07:16.151 --> 07:18.115
With lobster? You want brown ketchup?

07:19.118 --> 07:20.818
It's really nice Kryts, but you know me,

07:20.819 --> 07:23.112
I just thought it could do
with a bit of a pep-up...

07:23.147 --> 07:27.113
I can't believe it. I simply cannot b -

07:32.764 --> 07:34.761
Oh well done, bud! Now we'll
have to do the washing up!

07:36.770 --> 07:37.764
He's literally blown his top!

07:39.760 --> 07:40.763
Cat, can you go and get a spare head?

07:41.768 --> 07:44.321
How come I have to do
everything around here?

07:44.322 --> 07:48.761
I never get a second to myself! "Cat do
this", "Cat do that"; what am I? A dog?

07:58.759 --> 08:00.759
There. I think that's it; boot him up.

08:02.961 --> 08:03.961
You're sure you know what you're doing?

08:04.561 --> 08:05.361
Hey...

08:07.767 --> 08:09.760
Ketchup? With lobster, you want -

08:13.768 --> 08:14.757
I thought you said you
knew what you were doing!

08:15.767 --> 08:16.843
No, I just said 'hey'.

08:17.744 --> 08:20.758
If you'd let me finish the whole sentence
it'd have been: 'hey... no I don't'.

08:24.258 --> 08:25.158
Any luck?

08:25.759 --> 08:27.356
We've been back and forth
through his core program

08:27.357 --> 08:28.765
and, as far as we can
tell, nothing's wrong.

08:29.758 --> 08:31.762
Maybe worth testing it
with one of his spare heads?

08:31.797 --> 08:32.724
What spare heads...

08:32.759 --> 08:33.756
We've blown them all out!

08:35.763 --> 08:36.643
Look at it. have you ever seen

08:36.644 --> 08:38.755
so many blackheads outside the
staffroom of a fried chicken franchise?

08:41.357 --> 08:45.249
We've managed to save his RAM chips, so
at least we've got his personality on disk,

08:45.250 --> 08:46.761
but, that's about it...

08:46.796 --> 08:49.975
Life without a head... that's gonna
put a real crimp on his lifestyle.

08:50.676 --> 08:52.366
I mean, what can you do without a head?

08:52.757 --> 08:53.758
Apart from being you? Hardly anything.

08:54.755 --> 08:56.721
We're going to have to get
him another one, somehow.

08:56.756 --> 08:59.757
I should've been looking out for
him. How could I let this happen?

09:00.755 --> 09:03.756
When was the Centauri built..? Maybe
they had a mechanoid service unit?

09:04.756 --> 09:06.757
Think. Any clues when it was built?

09:07.756 --> 09:08.754
Which century?

09:11.466 --> 09:12.566
What're you doing?

09:12.601 --> 09:13.932
Logging on to their mainframe...

09:14.633 --> 09:16.856
If there's a Divadroid signature
on their supplies inventory

09:16.857 --> 09:19.298
then it's possible there're some
mech heads 'round there somewhere.

09:21.300 --> 09:22.299
Maybe 29th...

09:42.696 --> 09:43.596
Look!

09:45.299 --> 09:49.294
Hey; simulant... probably rogue,
let's get the smeg outta here!

09:59.348 --> 10:00.350
Hmm, you smell good...

10:00.385 --> 10:01.352
Thanks!

10:09.347 --> 10:10.352
They're all missing their primers.

10:11.352 --> 10:12.930
Well this Johnny won't help us.

10:13.531 --> 10:17.357
Simulants hate anything human or humanoid.
In fact, anything beginning with a 'hu'...

10:18.742 --> 10:19.709
This is nuts!

10:19.744 --> 10:21.745
We look great! What are you talking about?

10:22.743 --> 10:23.747
This is never gonna work.

10:24.745 --> 10:26.742
Ak ak ak akka ak? Ha ak?

10:26.777 --> 10:28.257
Hyak ak ak ak! Ak akakakak!

10:28.292 --> 10:29.738
You can't speak GELF...

10:30.542 --> 10:31.329
Neither can the sim!

10:31.330 --> 10:33.738
We'll just do an impression of you first
thing in the morning and we'll be fine!

10:35.741 --> 10:36.541
Come on, boy...

10:40.740 --> 10:42.738
This is so demeaning
I feel like a piece of meat!

10:43.743 --> 10:44.739
There's someone up there!

10:51.354 --> 10:54.354
It's worse than a chronic
catarr sufferers' annual outing!

10:58.365 --> 11:00.366
After spare mech heads, 'ey?

11:02.362 --> 11:07.332
'Uman! Lovely with a bit of
mint sauce! 'Ow about a trade?

11:07.367 --> 11:13.361
We ain't sellin', okay? Fuel,
supplies, anything, but not the human.

11:14.364 --> 11:16.365
I was just tellin' him - no deal.

11:17.367 --> 11:19.367
Like she says: no deal.

11:20.364 --> 11:23.362
You tell him, Bud-Babe!
No deal! You got that?

11:24.362 --> 11:26.363
So... you speak Earth, 'ey?

11:35.364 --> 11:39.361
Tails... you can 'ave the mech 'eads
for free... 'eads... I take the 'uman.

11:40.366 --> 11:41.365
Hey, wait a minute!

11:45.361 --> 11:52.694
It's tails, the 'eads are yours.
And, 'ere, are the primers.

11:53.195 --> 11:55.533
Now, 'ow about a toast, 'ey?

11:57.334 --> 12:05.263
To Simulants: the greatest droids in the
Universe but never trust 'em, 'ey? Cheers!

12:17.443 --> 12:18.441
Aw, we've been set up!

12:19.441 --> 12:20.404
But how?

12:20.439 --> 12:24.440
He must have had a sidekick, he kept us
talking while his mate ransacked the ship!

12:25.440 --> 12:26.242
Kryten!

12:32.441 --> 12:34.442
They've taken his RAM chip, too...

12:48.439 --> 12:52.439
'Ere's a little job for you, Able.
Looks like a negadrive blow back.

12:53.448 --> 12:54.439
Oh wow! Another mech.

12:55.442 --> 12:59.438
Fix 'im, ready for market, or I'll
apply the electro-leash to your nipples.

13:00.439 --> 13:03.273
Fix him, or get fried nipple nuts?

13:03.274 --> 13:08.440
Er, er, I think I'm gonna choose
the 'fix him' option! Deal!

13:10.436 --> 13:12.439
'Urry up! You stupid 'zoney!

13:13.448 --> 13:15.439
Is now a good time to ask about a pay rise?

13:17.439 --> 13:20.441
Uh, I'm almost out of
ultrazone, I need some more.

13:21.443 --> 13:24.437
Fix the mech, first. 'Ere's 'is RAM chip.

13:35.940 --> 13:36.941
Totally tubular!

13:51.942 --> 13:53.945
Goodness me! What a peculiar experience.

13:54.940 --> 13:57.943
Thank you, Mr... er - Mr...
er - What is your name?

13:58.949 --> 13:59.939
Er, just give me a second, okay?

14:01.941 --> 14:05.938
I've just sent that query down to long term
memory retrieval. It'll be back in no time.

14:08.500 --> 14:09.492
Hang on, here it comes.

14:11.495 --> 14:12.492
Told you it would be quick.

14:14.491 --> 14:17.490
Abel. My name's Able: A - B - L - E, Able.

14:18.496 --> 14:20.490
My name is Kryten. You're a
4000-series, too, aren't you?

14:21.498 --> 14:23.493
Er, hang on. Won't take a tick.

14:25.495 --> 14:27.491
Please, don't bother.
Believe me, you are a 4000.

14:28.495 --> 14:30.493
Well, I could check, it'll
only take about twenty seconds.

14:32.490 --> 14:35.328
Your serial number's '2X4C'
- I'm a 2X4c too!

14:35.329 --> 14:37.488
We must have the same motherboard.

14:37.523 --> 14:41.505
Wohh, then you're my bro'! Hey,
wow, you wanna try some Ultrazone?

14:42.510 --> 14:44.469
Ultrazone's dangerous and highly addictive!

14:44.504 --> 14:48.505
Why, I only use it every now and then,
y'know? It helps me get through the day.

14:48.540 --> 14:49.509
Well how come you ended up here?

14:50.507 --> 14:51.506
Er, hang on.

14:53.513 --> 14:54.513
What an irritating characteristic...

14:55.506 --> 14:59.504
Okay: the ship I was on, well,
it, er, kind of crashed a bit.

15:00.502 --> 15:01.504
'Crashed a bit'?

15:02.505 --> 15:05.780
All the crew just lay there and
they didn't talk to me anymore.

15:05.781 --> 15:09.504
Then, after a couple of years
I figured out they must be dead.

15:09.505 --> 15:13.287
Then a long time later, the
Simulant guy came and picked me up.

15:13.288 --> 15:17.601
He's a bit of a psychopathic killing
machine, but, he has his good side.

15:17.602 --> 15:19.905
And, he has a huge stash of ultrazone!

15:20.058 --> 15:22.057
You sure you won't try some, Kryten? Bro'?

15:23.055 --> 15:26.058
I'm not your bro', and I do not touch
ultrazone! It corrupts your circuit boards!

15:28.062 --> 15:30.059
Well, that's what people say,
but... where's the evidence?

15:33.557 --> 15:34.857
Have I just said that?

15:40.054 --> 15:44.057
Appoaching the Centauri. 80 clicks
and closing. Nice and easy, man...

15:45.058 --> 15:48.059
Hang on, their retros have
started up. They've spotted us!

15:52.060 --> 15:55.055
Look at the accelleration of that thing!
They're already halfway across the sector!

15:56.053 --> 15:59.056
The Centauri can travel at speeds
that we can only dream of...

15:59.091 --> 16:02.060
Most ice cream vans can travel
at speeds we can only dream of...

16:04.057 --> 16:07.058
We're never gonna catch
them now. We've lost Kryten.

16:08.056 --> 16:13.057
Okay, turn the thrusters to maximum
speed on a bearing Q23 stroke J80.

16:17.052 --> 16:19.054
This is the opposite direction
to the Centauri, full speed!

16:19.089 --> 16:20.022
Precisely.

16:20.057 --> 16:21.062
Well, why do we wanna do that?

16:21.097 --> 16:23.020
It's totally insane.

16:23.055 --> 16:24.022
So why do we wanna do it then?

16:24.057 --> 16:27.290
The only reason I can think of is if
we've planted something on the Centauri

16:27.291 --> 16:29.054
and we knew it was
gonna blow any second.

16:29.582 --> 16:31.576
They've turned around
and started tracking us!

16:33.574 --> 16:34.574
What a fluke!

16:41.577 --> 16:44.584
Getting an incoming... someone's
beaming on board... cargo bay!

16:52.571 --> 16:53.578
We know about the bomb.

16:55.570 --> 16:57.570
So we did plant a bomb!
I was beginning to wonder.

16:58.572 --> 17:02.546
Where did you hide it!? Speak! Or
you'll spend the rest of the day

17:02.547 --> 17:05.570
picking bits of charred
mech out of your clothing.

17:06.576 --> 17:07.569
Er, can I change into dungarees?

17:08.567 --> 17:09.569
Hand over Kryten and we'll tell ya.

17:10.570 --> 17:13.573
Clearly, I need to prove myself...

17:15.969 --> 17:21.435
Kryten, that file in your CPU; the
one you've never been able to access...

17:22.737 --> 17:25.567
The password is '4X2C'...

17:26.569 --> 17:28.575
Hang on a minute...

17:29.571 --> 17:32.574
It's about your creator,
Kryten, Dr Mammett.

17:32.609 --> 17:33.589
Kryten, no!

17:33.624 --> 17:34.569
Acessing now...

17:37.572 --> 17:41.575
No! It can't be true... It can't...

17:42.570 --> 17:45.573
The truth is in there, that's
what turned me into a 'zoney.

17:46.568 --> 17:53.566
Who's next? The Cat? Or the
woman? Choose, heads or tails?

17:55.771 --> 17:56.971
Heads!

18:04.566 --> 18:06.062
Right, lets send them back to their ship

18:06.063 --> 18:08.569
and get the hell out of 'ere
before they get their smeg together!

18:23.597 --> 18:24.965
Kryten, man, what's wrong?

18:25.966 --> 18:28.594
You look sadder than the salad you
get with a takaway shaami kebab.

18:29.595 --> 18:31.593
Tell me what you found
out about your creator.

18:31.628 --> 18:33.556
I can't, sir, it's too terrible.

18:33.591 --> 18:35.595
Kryten, me and you are
amigos; you've gotta tell me.

18:36.662 --> 18:37.623
Oh, it's so humiliating!

18:37.658 --> 18:38.664
Tell me about Professor Mammett!

18:40.657 --> 18:45.868
Well, she was due to marry John
Warburton, a fellow bio-engineer.

18:46.069 --> 18:48.799
He jilted her the day
before their wedding,

18:48.800 --> 18:51.928
so she decided to create
a droid in his image,

18:51.929 --> 18:56.656
a pompous, ridiculous-looking,
mother-hen clucking, irascible buffoon.

18:57.658 --> 18:58.692
What happenned to this droid?

18:59.660 --> 19:00.656
That droid, sir, is me!

19:03.676 --> 19:08.670
Pompous? Ridiculous-looking? Mother-hen
clucking? Oh yeah, I see now...

19:10.680 --> 19:14.681
We're all John Warburton, sir, the entire
4000-series. It was Mammett's revenge.

19:15.670 --> 19:17.344
Well, judging from the length
of your groinal attachment,

19:17.345 --> 19:18.672
you can see why she was
so sad to lose him...

19:20.672 --> 19:23.677
As part of the joke,
all my negative emotions,

19:23.678 --> 19:26.683
jealousy, anger, are
stored on a special file;

19:26.684 --> 19:31.671
my 'negadrive'. Now, when this file
gets full it blows! Just like he used to.

19:31.706 --> 19:34.638
All your resentment's in
this thing? It's so small.

19:34.673 --> 19:36.481
Oh, don't be fooled by that, sir.

19:36.482 --> 19:39.522
This box contains the greatest
concentration of anger,

19:39.523 --> 19:42.673
jealousy and resentment
outside a BAFTA awards ceremony!

19:43.670 --> 19:46.049
Able felt betrayed,
lost all his self-esteem;

19:46.050 --> 19:47.859
it's what turned him to ultrazone.

19:48.960 --> 19:50.369
He told me, he's promised to quit.

19:50.671 --> 19:52.671
How could Mammett have done this?

19:53.679 --> 19:57.965
Kryten, you may have started out as a
joke, but you've grown, you've changed.

19:57.966 --> 19:59.889
Look how different you are to Able.

19:59.890 --> 20:03.679
If Mammett came in here now, I bet
she wouldn't even recognise you.

20:03.714 --> 20:04.666
I've evolved?

20:04.701 --> 20:05.634
You bet.

20:05.669 --> 20:07.667
I've become something
that's... beyond a joke?

20:08.672 --> 20:09.372
Too right, man.

20:10.666 --> 20:12.666
There's something coming
in from the starboard bow!

20:16.667 --> 20:17.633
The Sim's back; he's got a lock on!

20:17.668 --> 20:20.671
Reverse thrust - go! Five, niner, seven.

20:21.668 --> 20:24.666
Missed, but still locked on! Right,
I'm taking us into that asteroid belt.

20:24.701 --> 20:25.666
Oh, not an asteroid belt!

20:25.701 --> 20:26.636
Is that a problem?

20:26.671 --> 20:30.676
It sure is! Everything tips from side
to side, and my hair gets all messed up!

20:32.674 --> 20:34.671
So what do we do? Stay
here and get splattered?

20:34.706 --> 20:36.668
Rather that than me
looking like Tina Turner!

20:37.166 --> 20:38.466
I'm taking us in.

20:38.669 --> 20:41.274
Once we're in the belt, we'll have
to maintain ship and engine silence

20:41.275 --> 20:42.668
'till he's convinced we're not there.

20:46.666 --> 20:49.663
I know you're in that belt... somewhere...

20:52.664 --> 20:55.669
One little mistake... and you're mine...

21:26.664 --> 21:28.661
The mistake is made...

21:32.662 --> 21:33.663
What happenned, man!?

21:34.661 --> 21:36.670
I dunno, I don't know nothin'!

21:36.705 --> 21:37.664
Clear out of here!

21:40.665 --> 21:41.663
Leave him to me!

21:46.667 --> 21:50.662
Oh, I think I may have
pressed the wrong button...

21:51.663 --> 21:54.137
You have jeapordised the
lives of the entire crew,

21:54.138 --> 21:56.659
breaking the most basic,
fundamental command codes!

21:57.660 --> 22:00.660
I'm sorry - I didn't mean nuthin'...

22:05.659 --> 22:07.658
This dude's real mad,
we don't stand a chance!

22:08.664 --> 22:10.094
I can't throw him
off; nothing's working,

22:10.095 --> 22:11.661
I'm using every trick
I know to distract him!

22:12.660 --> 22:16.668
Pity we can't all moon out of the starboard
portholes! That always works for me!

22:18.661 --> 22:20.657
Wait! Someone's left
the ship, an escape pod!

22:22.661 --> 22:23.624
It's Able!

22:23.659 --> 22:25.622
It's heading towards the Sim's ship.

22:25.657 --> 22:30.656
Why, that slimy, double-crossing, two-faced
piece of scum! He's no brother of mine!

22:35.659 --> 22:36.628
He's fired something at them...

22:36.663 --> 22:39.623
Some sort of energy field... looks heavy.

22:39.658 --> 22:42.358
The negadrive! He's
used my negadrive energy

22:42.359 --> 22:45.538
and re-routed it through
the escape pod's thrusters.

22:45.539 --> 22:48.658
The Simulant ship is
engulfed in all my negativity.

22:51.656 --> 22:57.660
It's all 'opeless! Nobody
loves me; I'm so ugly!

22:58.659 --> 23:05.664
I never get invited to parties! I
'ate this ship! I 'ate everything!

23:27.654 --> 23:29.654
Able's pod just crash-landed.

23:30.655 --> 23:32.655
He threw his life away to save
us and we hardly knew him...

23:33.663 --> 23:35.488
With your permission, sirs, ma'am,

23:35.489 --> 23:38.656
I should like to recover the
body and perform last rites.

23:46.653 --> 23:47.652
Do you need a hand, Kryts?

23:48.656 --> 23:50.655
He ain't heavy, sir, he's my brother.
