Like some kind of fucking animal
superhero...

24:37.040 --> 24:39.695
it scaled the wall and ran away,
right across the city.

24:42.872 --> 24:47.224
Of course, they caught it,
they killed it...

24:47.268 --> 24:52.752

had turned to poison.

24:55.189 --> 24:57.234
It was poisoned by fear.

It will lead them here to you.

I promise if you let me go
right now...

better hot.

to know each other.

things I want to know.

me out, right?

34:38.685 --> 34:40.252
You've worked out, if I wanted
to kill you...

34:40.295 --> 34:41.862

thing since you got here today.

47:14.179 --> 47:16.224
Where did you go to school?

47:19.401 --> 47:21.273
East Star High.

47:21.316 --> 47:26.844
And you were raised in
the church, a good church girl?

47:32.980 --> 47:34.460
I can't hear you.

47:42.468 --> 47:46.733
And I just know it broke your
heart when Daddy left home.

47:52.826 --> 47:56.525
Who are you?Just stick to the questions.

47:59.659 --> 48:01.182
It broke your heart.

48:03.141 --> 48:04.751
Yes.

48:04.794 --> 48:09.669
Mom was a nurse, your dad
was a team doctor.

48:09.712 --> 48:12.585
Left Mommy for a cheerleader...

48:15.196 --> 48:18.852
and that put your twin sister
at the end of a rope.

48:23.161 --> 48:25.163
I heard how much you loved her.

48:30.603 --> 48:32.692
We've all had people we loved.

48:37.479 --> 48:39.655
But you're a survivor.

48:42.441 --> 48:45.531
You went back to school and you
made something of yourself.

48:45.574 --> 48:46.924
Why are you doing this?

48:46.967 --> 48:49.883
But there was no
English, was there?

48:49.927 --> 48:52.799
And there was no library job,
was there?

48:54.061 --> 48:55.976
So what did you study?

48:58.500 --> 49:00.720
Answer me!Medicine.

49:02.591 --> 49:05.986
What exactly did you study?

49:06.030 --> 49:07.422
Nursing.

49:12.340 --> 49:16.736
So, why don't we talk about the
biggest piece of the puzzle...

49:16.779 --> 49:20.000
the one thing I've wanted to
know since we got here today.

49:24.004 --> 49:25.701
What is your name?

49:25.745 --> 49:28.182
Cathy, my name is Cathy.

49:28.226 --> 49:29.836
No, it's not.

49:29.879 --> 49:33.709
My name is Cathy.

49:33.753 --> 49:38.976
Cathy was the name
of your dead sister.

49:51.075 --> 49:53.729
Come on!

50:02.651 --> 50:04.001
Natalie.

50:08.657 --> 50:11.921
My name is Natalie-Ann Stevens.

50:19.712 --> 50:22.367
I guess you're wondering
why I have you here.

50:24.456 --> 50:28.416
But you know what... Natalie?

50:30.244 --> 50:32.333
I think you already know.

52:04.947 --> 52:08.299
Oh, no...

53:13.581 --> 53:14.843
Oh--

53:20.893 --> 53:22.721
Oh, come on.

53:24.853 --> 53:28.074
And finally, she sleeps.

53:29.815 --> 53:33.993
The world's most beautiful,
little girl.

53:39.607 --> 53:41.696
Come on.

53:41.740 --> 53:42.958
OPERATOR
9-1-1, what's--

53:43.002 --> 53:48.442
Hello Can you hear me?

53:50.314 --> 53:53.360
Can you hear me, police

53:53.404 --> 53:56.233
Ssh.

54:18.907 --> 54:22.650
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

54:22.694 --> 54:25.044
My name is Cathy, I'm being
held hostage.

54:25.087 --> 54:26.741
Can you trace this cell

54:26.785 --> 54:30.397
I was thrown in the trunk
of a car, a Dodge, I think.

54:32.704 --> 54:35.272
Hello, can you hear me?

54:57.598 --> 55:00.035
Where is it?

55:00.079 --> 55:02.037
Where's the fucking phone?

55:03.778 --> 55:05.127
No.

55:15.616 --> 55:17.357
You wanna get this over with?

55:17.401 --> 55:21.143
All right, you worked in a
hospital, Nurse Stevens.

55:21.187 --> 55:22.928
Where did you work?

55:22.971 --> 55:24.364
Saint Mary's Green Bay.

55:24.408 --> 55:25.931
And after?

55:25.974 --> 55:29.978
All Angels, Charleston.

55:30.022 --> 55:34.069
And how many of those patients
died inexplicably in your care?

55:35.984 --> 55:37.464
Which one?

55:39.901 --> 55:43.601
You mean which one of the
Charleston 3 was my wife?

55:45.472 --> 55:50.608
Number 3, Alana Matthews-Lewis.

55:52.523 --> 55:54.916
Remember her?

55:54.960 --> 55:58.703
That's why you moved away,
wasn't it?

55:58.746 --> 56:02.837
Three people die unaccountably,
people were curious.

56:02.881 --> 56:06.101
The duty nurses were questioned.

56:06.145 --> 56:09.366
This was four years ago,
there was a trial.

56:09.409 --> 56:11.846
All the nurses were acquitted,
we were innocent.

56:11.890 --> 56:13.935
So why'd you leave?

56:13.979 --> 56:18.940
I needed a fresh start, this
trial, it ruined my life.

56:18.984 --> 56:20.464
And what about those three
people...

56:20.507 --> 56:22.422
do they get a fresh start?

56:22.466 --> 56:25.164
What about my wife?

56:25.207 --> 56:27.079
You see, first I-I bought
into it...

56:27.122 --> 56:28.994
and then a few things started
to not make sense...

56:29.037 --> 56:33.128
like my wife's missing wedding
ring, she never took it off.

56:33.172 --> 56:35.783
And then there was John Lampty,
he died of organ failure.

56:35.827 --> 56:38.003
But a month earlier, he passed
his medical insurance.

56:38.046 --> 56:42.224
Mr. Lampty, he died of an
undiagnosed kidney disease.

56:42.268 --> 56:44.313
Alana was drunk.

56:44.357 --> 56:46.620
Only I know my wife didn't
drink that much.

56:46.664 --> 56:53.584
And her blood was full of GHB,
a rape drug!

56:53.627 --> 56:56.978
Alana's blood was flooded
with that drug!

56:59.024 --> 57:03.158
The court found no negligence
with the hospital.

57:03.202 --> 57:06.597
I'm sorry for your loss.

57:06.640 --> 57:08.250
Are you?

57:10.949 --> 57:14.909
You're not here because I think
you killed my wife.

57:14.953 --> 57:18.347
You're here because I know you
killed my wife...

57:18.391 --> 57:20.524
and I want to know why.

57:22.830 --> 57:26.181
And if I don't get a good enough
explanation, Natalie...

57:26.225 --> 57:31.970
as to why my wife died,
then you will die.

58:15.927 --> 58:20.671
LEWIS
So, Summer is four today.

58:20.714 --> 58:24.718
She was so excited, that she
was awake at 5:00 AM...

58:24.762 --> 58:26.067
weren't you?

58:32.639 --> 58:35.424
This is her beautiful mom
Alana...

58:35.468 --> 58:39.646
and she is tired, because she
stayed up to watch the game.

58:41.343 --> 58:43.389
So tired.

59:18.642 --> 59:21.079
Come on, let's have a picture.

59:22.515 --> 59:24.865
Say hello to the family.

59:24.909 --> 59:26.563
Hey. Hello.

59:28.782 --> 59:30.523
ALANA  She's four,
she's getting old...

59:30.567 --> 59:33.613
and she stays up all night.

59:33.657 --> 59:37.095
Uh-huh, like Mommy, because
Mommy sleeps all night long.

59:37.138 --> 59:38.226
Oh, it's because I--

59:40.098 --> 59:42.753
Let's show Daddy, yeah!
We got you!

59:42.796 --> 59:46.539
It's very cold and we're
freezing and it's snowing...

59:46.583 --> 59:48.106
and Summer's hat's fallen off.

59:57.071 --> 59:58.682
Zip it hard.

1:00:01.685 --> 1:00:02.903
Yeah!

1:00:12.565 --> 1:00:15.742
Happy Thanksgiving,
Mom and Dad, we love you.

1:00:15.786 --> 1:00:17.526
Happy Thanksgiving, in-laws.

1:00:17.570 --> 1:00:21.661
Wave to the camera!
Say "bring presents"!

1:00:21.705 --> 1:00:24.055
We miss you! Lots and lots of presents!

1:00:24.098 --> 1:00:25.622
See you soon.

1:00:49.863 --> 1:00:52.431
No, please! Please, I'll tell
you!

1:00:54.651 --> 1:00:56.217
I'll tell you everything.

1:01:01.919 --> 1:01:03.442
Please.

1:01:12.625 --> 1:01:16.368
You were right, we were raised
in the church, my sister and I.

1:01:18.370 --> 1:01:23.331
We learnt the ways of the Bible,
we had God in our hearts...

1:01:23.375 --> 1:01:26.160
we were happy, we were loved.

1:01:26.204 --> 1:01:28.859
We were protected by God.

1:01:31.688 --> 1:01:35.692
But, you see, not by the man
who should have.

1:01:35.735 --> 1:01:37.824
My father, he ran around
for months...

1:01:37.868 --> 1:01:40.958
with my sisters' best friend.

1:01:41.001 --> 1:01:46.006
Lies upon lies, my mother,
she found out.

1:01:46.050 --> 1:01:49.444
Finally had the courage to
confront him about it.

1:01:49.488 --> 1:01:52.752
Then the coward, he just packed
his bags and he left.

1:01:52.796 --> 1:01:56.756
He abandoned us, just left us
with all his shame.

1:01:56.800 --> 1:01:59.106
The town, they stopped talking
to us...

1:01:59.150 --> 1:02:02.719
stopped looking us in the eye,
like we were invisible.

1:02:02.762 --> 1:02:04.372
What does this got to do
with my wife?

1:02:04.416 --> 1:02:07.114
Every Sunday, we would
just sit there.

1:02:07.158 --> 1:02:09.943
We would just listen
to the church bells...

1:02:09.987 --> 1:02:14.295
calling everybody to service
and we just held hands...

1:02:14.339 --> 1:02:20.084
and we lost everything.

1:02:20.127 --> 1:02:25.611
We had done nothing wrong...
we were good people...

1:02:25.654 --> 1:02:29.310
and we were being punished
for my father's sins.

1:02:31.530 --> 1:02:34.707
And my sister, my poor,
baby sister...

1:02:36.883 --> 1:02:44.151
I found her in the barn...
hanging from the rafters.

1:02:46.371 --> 1:02:49.156
I dedicated my life to her...

1:02:49.200 --> 1:02:53.595
to serving people, and these
patients in the hospital...

1:02:53.639 --> 1:02:56.424
they would talk to me,
they would confide in me.

1:02:56.468 --> 1:03:00.646
They would tell me their
secrets...

1:03:00.689 --> 1:03:02.648
things that they had done...

1:03:05.390 --> 1:03:07.174
bad things.

1:03:11.657 --> 1:03:15.400
Did you know John Lampty
had two wives?

1:03:15.443 --> 1:03:17.881
You remember Jane Spencer?

1:03:17.924 --> 1:03:20.797
She threw herself off a second
floor balcony after calling...

1:03:20.840 --> 1:03:23.582
the cops saying that her husband
was beating the shit out of her?

1:03:23.625 --> 1:03:26.498
It was all lies, he hadn't laid
a finger on her.

1:03:26.541 --> 1:03:30.676
He was arrested, charged
with attempted murder.

1:03:30.719 --> 1:03:32.373
She told me everything
after I caught her...

1:03:32.417 --> 1:03:33.853
splitting her stitches
on her face...

1:03:33.897 --> 1:03:36.421
making her wounds look worse.

1:03:36.464 --> 1:03:38.510
She was just trying to shake him
down for divorce money.

1:03:40.729 --> 1:03:42.427
That man, he loved her.

1:03:42.470 --> 1:03:45.082
My wife loved me.

1:03:45.125 --> 1:03:47.824
Your wife--

1:03:50.914 --> 1:03:55.875
Your wife, she wasn't wearing
her wedding ring...

1:03:55.919 --> 1:03:59.052
because she was spreading her
legs for another man.

1:03:59.096 --> 1:04:00.880
You're lying.

1:04:00.924 --> 1:04:04.536
She was on her hands and knees
panting like a fucking dog.

1:04:04.579 --> 1:04:06.451
Don't you say another word.

1:04:06.494 --> 1:04:11.586
Come on, she was dressed to the
nines, drunk in a hotel bar.

1:04:11.630 --> 1:04:15.416
Not a single piece of ID was
found on her when she collapsed.

1:04:15.460 --> 1:04:19.551
Do you really believe that
she was at a work meeting?

1:04:19.594 --> 1:04:22.728
I saw him, the guy, he came
to visit her in secret...

1:04:22.771 --> 1:04:27.124
in the hospital, big guy,
tall guy, handsome guy.

1:04:27.167 --> 1:04:28.560
Shut up.

1:04:28.603 --> 1:04:30.344
He told me that they were doing
it all the time.

1:04:30.388 --> 1:04:34.087
That they couldn't help
themselves.

1:04:34.131 --> 1:04:38.962
See the Bible says that we
should hold marriage with honor.

1:04:39.005 --> 1:04:43.314
Your wife was a sinner,
your wife was a whore!

1:04:43.357 --> 1:04:45.577
Don't you say another word!

1:04:45.620 --> 1:04:48.841
She was a sinner...

1:04:48.885 --> 1:04:54.194
so you tell me,
who's in the wrong?

1:04:55.979 --> 1:05:02.899
You, Natalie, or your wife?

1:05:12.256 --> 1:05:13.344
I did it.

1:05:20.003 --> 1:05:21.700
I need to hear you say it.

1:05:26.966 --> 1:05:28.576
I killed her.

1:05:36.410 --> 1:05:39.761
And now you know why.

1:05:47.508 --> 1:05:50.120
Stop... you're an idiot.

1:05:58.650 --> 1:06:01.435
What? What do you want
me to say?

1:06:01.479 --> 1:06:03.046
My name is Alana--

1:06:08.312 --> 1:06:10.531
You're an idiot.

1:06:17.364 --> 1:06:20.237
What? What do you want
me to say?

1:08:10.303 --> 1:08:11.913
Agh!

1:09:06.142 --> 1:09:07.882
Enjoying the view, sir?

1:09:09.232 --> 1:09:11.538
I used to come here
with my wife.

1:09:14.150 --> 1:09:15.716
Is your hand okay?

1:09:17.805 --> 1:09:23.028
Didn't even see that. I was just
doing some DIY at home.

1:09:23.071 --> 1:09:25.683
And where's home?

1:09:25.726 --> 1:09:30.122
Just across the ridge,
about three miles away.

1:09:30.166 --> 1:09:32.037
Do you have your license
with you, sir?

1:09:33.256 --> 1:09:36.215
Is there a problem?License, please.

1:09:36.259 --> 1:09:37.347
Sure.

1:09:51.056 --> 1:09:52.797
Everything okay, officer?

1:09:52.840 --> 1:09:54.320
Just investigating a call...

1:09:54.364 --> 1:09:56.801
a car matching yours
was described.

1:10:04.765 --> 1:10:07.420
Your car's very clean,
Mr. Lewis.

1:10:07.464 --> 1:10:08.987
Is it?

1:10:13.905 --> 1:10:15.123
He good.

1:10:18.779 --> 1:10:20.346
Mind if I take a look
in the trunk?

1:10:22.305 --> 1:10:23.436
Sure.

1:10:36.667 --> 1:10:38.321
This yours?

1:10:38.364 --> 1:10:40.192
They're my wife's.

1:10:42.194 --> 1:10:43.804
Sorry to have troubled you, sir.

1:10:43.848 --> 1:10:46.242
Not a problem.

1:11:49.914 --> 1:11:51.307
What do I say to my daughter...

1:11:51.350 --> 1:11:53.439
when she asks what happened
to her mom?

1:11:55.833 --> 1:11:58.923
You had no right to take
my wife from me...

1:11:58.966 --> 1:12:01.229
before I had a chance
to talk to her.

1:12:04.929 --> 1:12:07.453
You have to turn yourself in.

1:12:09.673 --> 1:12:12.023
I think that's gonna
be a problem.

1:12:18.421 --> 1:12:21.685
Why'd you have to ruin
everything?

1:12:21.728 --> 1:12:26.211
My name is Cathy!

1:12:39.311 --> 1:12:41.748
Now you think I'm gonna
give my life up for you?

1:12:41.792 --> 1:12:44.360
I'm Cathy now, I'm happy...

1:12:44.403 --> 1:12:47.058
and you expect me to give
it all up, for you?

1:13:07.165 --> 1:13:08.993
Where's the gun?!

1:13:28.273 --> 1:13:29.970
No!

1:14:18.279 --> 1:14:19.803
She's sick, she get better.

Do exactly as the lady says,
okay?

1:14:47.570 --> 1:14:50.529
Why did you make things
so complicated?

1:14:50.573 --> 1:14:54.228
Everything was so simple...
and now this.

1:14:54.272 --> 1:14:56.709
Please, she's done nothing
wrong.

1:14:56.753 --> 1:15:00.408

1:15:00.452 --> 1:15:01.975
Neither did I.

Natalie, listen to--

1:15:03.760 --> 1:15:06.937
My name-- my name is Cathy.

1:15:09.026 --> 1:15:11.071
She's a kid.

1:15:11.115 --> 1:15:14.684

Please, I'm begging you,
don't hurt my child.

1:15:27.131 --> 1:15:33.572
Your child? You think this
is your child?

1:15:36.532 --> 1:15:39.012
You were betrayed, Robert.

1:15:44.627 --> 1:15:50.458
Cathy, listen to me, you don't
have to turn yourself in.

1:15:50.502 --> 1:15:52.591
I won't say anything to anyone.

1:15:52.635 --> 1:15:54.114
I don't believe you.

1:15:54.158 --> 1:15:56.247
You can go back to your life,
just as it was.

1:15:56.290 --> 1:15:58.075
I can't, I called the cops,
they'll trace the cell.

1:15:58.118 --> 1:16:01.469
They'll be here, I mean, what am
I supposed to say to them?

1:16:04.647 --> 1:16:07.693
This is gonna end one way,
I'm so sorry.

1:16:07.737 --> 1:16:11.436
Except for one thing.

1:16:11.479 --> 1:16:13.177
This house is recording
everything.

1:16:15.005 --> 1:16:16.615
What?

1:16:16.659 --> 1:16:20.619
They're gonna hear everything
you just said.

1:16:20.663 --> 1:16:23.535
You're lying.

1:16:23.579 --> 1:16:25.972
Agh!Summer, run, run!

1:17:28.731 --> 1:17:32.822

1:18:13.166 --> 1:18:16.909
Quickly... close the door.

1:18:16.953 --> 1:18:19.085
You stay here.

1:18:26.397 --> 1:18:27.746
Fuck!
