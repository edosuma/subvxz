01:23.683 --> 01:26.851
No. I didn't mean "what"

was there, Edith?
You sighed.

01:37.496 --> 01:39.164
Did I sigh?

01:39.231 --> 01:42.734
Yeah, you sighed,
and you heaved it right over
in this direction.

- What do you mean

It's a victim
of crass commercialism.

02:34.787 --> 02:37.956
Oh, my. Did I mean all that?

02:40.760 --> 02:44.262
You know, Michael's right.
Christmas is never like
what you read about.

02:44.329 --> 02:48.099
Nobody ever sits around

and telling ghost stories.

02:48.167 --> 02:54.005
Maybe that's it, Archie.
We got no chestnuts
roasting on the fire.

Twenty years.

any fireplaces anywhere?

03:06.385 --> 03:08.887
No.
[ Mocking ]
No.

03:08.954 --> 03:12.123
So maybe that's why
we don't have chestnuts, huh?

03:12.191 --> 03:15.193
'Cause the house
happens to be heated
by radiators.

03:15.261 --> 03:21.099
That's right, Archie.
And "radiated" chestnuts
wouldn't be the same.

03:25.271 --> 03:29.274
But it ain't just the nuts.
It's the bubble.

03:29.341 --> 03:33.878
Huh?
Ah, geez.
The bubbles are missing.

03:33.946 --> 03:37.816

I am gay. I'm gay.
I'm as gay
as everybody here!

Gee, you sure coulda
fooled me.

03:46.325 --> 03:51.162
What's the matter, Archie?
You're acting like you're giving
up on Christmas this year.

03:51.230 --> 03:54.098
Why you so down?
Where's your Christmas spirit?

03:54.166 --> 03:58.002

the wreath on the door, huh?

Don't be telling me
I'm down, huh?

04:04.376 --> 04:07.045
Well, maybe down
isn't the right word.

04:07.112 --> 04:10.781
Maybe it's--
maybe it's more like low.

04:10.850 --> 04:13.852
Like this tree
you bought.

04:17.322 --> 04:20.992
What's the matter
with the tree?
Archie, look at it.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.561
It's not exactly
the king of the forest.

04:24.363 --> 04:26.597
Yeah, or even a prince.

04:26.665 --> 04:30.235
There ain't nothing the matter
with this tree a little
decorating wouldn't help.

04:30.302 --> 04:32.503
How come nobody put
the star on it this year?

04:32.571 --> 04:35.073
I tried, Archie.

04:35.140 --> 04:39.810
But every time I put
the star on,
the tree fell over.

04:39.879 --> 04:42.546
I don't care
nothing about that.

04:42.614 --> 04:46.617
I wasn't laying out
no 20-30 bucks
for a big tree.

04:46.685 --> 04:50.788
Maybe if my firm would give out
their Christmas bonus as usual,

04:50.856 --> 04:53.358
well, then I'd have
laid out big, as usual.

04:53.425 --> 04:57.828
But they didn't.
They're cutting back.
There was no bonus, nothing.

to do a thing like that

08:00.345 --> 08:02.813

That is the stupidest thing
I ever heard of, naming two
places in the world the same.

08:06.918 --> 08:11.489

the same name. Like Odessa,
Russia and Odessa, Texas.

[ Scoffs ]

- What about the cigars?
- Cigars. Do you call
these things cigars here?

08:43.522 --> 08:48.025
When I smoke a cigar,
I wanna feel tobacco
between my teeth.

of these and I'm singeing

Thanks a lot, daddy.
We happened to think
you might like a small cigar...

09:01.940 --> 09:03.874
For when you don't
have time to finish a big one.

09:03.942 --> 09:07.878

it takes two weeks.

They smell like they was
dipped in a can of flit.

09:17.055 --> 09:20.324
Archie, just because you're in
a bad mood you don't have
to say our presents stink.

09:20.392 --> 09:24.228
I never used the word stink.

09:24.296 --> 09:28.666
All I'm saying is that
Christmas presents, they
ought to be individual-like.

09:28.733 --> 09:30.734
Oh, you mean like
what you gave us?

09:30.802 --> 09:32.836
A box of
his-and-hers handkerchiefs.

09:32.904 --> 09:35.406
Listen, if you don't like 'em,
you can give 'em back.

09:35.474 --> 09:37.542

I didn't get
no bonus this year.

09:37.609 --> 09:42.613
It's the thought that matters.
I love my her handkerchiefs.

How did you ever get 'em
to split a box?

09:45.984 --> 09:48.152
Aw, shush.

09:55.994 --> 09:59.997
I started talking about
individual presents.

10:00.065 --> 10:02.700
Like the time that
Gloria here was a little girl.

10:02.767 --> 10:06.770
And you wanted
a real China Dolly
and a Dollhouse.

10:06.838 --> 10:10.007
A real one.
I couldn't afford that.

10:10.075 --> 10:14.078
I was climbing the walls
trying to raise that money.
A buck here, a quarter there.

10:14.145 --> 10:17.815
Then just before Christmas,
the boss gave me my first bonus.

10:17.882 --> 10:21.552
You know, I coulda kissed
the guy. I ran outta there
faster than Jesse Owens.

10:21.620 --> 10:26.724
And I went out and bought you
the most beautiful China Dolly
and Dollhouse you ever seen.

10:26.791 --> 10:31.061
That's a lovely story, daddy.
But I don't remember that doll.

10:31.129 --> 10:34.465
That's 'cause
you never got it.
Hey, hey, hey.

10:36.801 --> 10:40.238
Your father had too much
to drink,
stifle yourself.

10:40.305 --> 10:43.140
And coming up the front steps
he tripped and fell.

10:43.208 --> 10:45.643
Will you stifle yourself.

10:45.711 --> 10:49.913
He wasn't hurt,
but the Dolly and house
was smashed to pieces.

11:12.304 --> 11:17.341
Oh. Well, then, what could you
possibly be here for?

11:17.409 --> 11:20.478
Uh, well,

11:20.545 --> 11:23.947
when I come by yesterday,
you was out.

11:24.015 --> 11:28.919
But I left the money for
our milk bill with Mrs. mcnab.
Didn't you get it?

Oh yeah, I got <i>that</i> money.
[ Edith ]
Oh, good.

11:37.596 --> 11:40.063
Then what do you want?

11:41.800 --> 11:47.405

embarrassing having to ask,
if you know what I mean.

11:47.472 --> 11:52.576
I know what he means.
I don't know
what he means.

11:52.644 --> 11:56.614

Now, who you gonna believe?
Me, or a big-mouth milkman?

13:13.024 --> 13:16.861
I'm tellin' ya, if feeney
got any extra money, it was
some back pay he had comin'...

13:16.928 --> 13:19.129
Because the firm
didn't give out no bonus.

13:19.197 --> 13:22.366
Well, then, why did wilbur
say that your boss came through
this year like he always does?

13:22.434 --> 13:26.003
Yeah. I wonder how
Mrs. feeney's enjoying
her new vacuum cleaner.

13:26.070 --> 13:29.072
Yeah, it's lucky for her
feeney got his bonus.

13:29.140 --> 13:32.976
Ma, you'd enjoy one of
those new cannister cleaners.
They're very powerful.

13:33.044 --> 13:38.215
Yeah. Great for picking up
big pine needles
from big Christmas trees.

13:40.852 --> 13:44.187
Stop it! Stop it,
both of you, this minute.

13:44.255 --> 13:47.758
If your father says
there was no bonus,
there was no bonus.

13:53.998 --> 13:58.569
Yeah. Why don't youse, uh,
go on, help your mother clear
off the table or something.

Why do you leave me alone
like that to answer the door?

15:01.299 --> 15:04.468
One thing I can't stand
about this time of the year,

15:04.536 --> 15:07.938

15:21.553 --> 15:24.555
I mean, just for a change,
can we have a little
silent night around here?

15:24.623 --> 15:28.458
Oh, all right.
¶ silent night ¶
no, no. Edith.

15:30.361 --> 15:33.531
You're scrapin' a nerve.

15:33.598 --> 15:37.701
You know, I think when you was
a kid, somebody must have
dropped you on your throat.

Yeah, daddy, cheer up.
You're acting like scrooge.

15:53.818 --> 15:55.986
Aw, don't "scrooge" me.

15:56.054 --> 16:01.058
I'm the only one around here
that understands the true
and solemn meaning of Christmas.

16:01.125 --> 16:05.529
Which is a time for peace
and quiet "contemptation."

16:05.597 --> 16:10.100
Oh, but I think you're allowed
to be jolly too.

16:10.168 --> 16:14.504
Sure you can be jolly,
Edith. Just be jolly
with your mouth shut.

16:16.875 --> 16:20.210
Just sit there
and think.
Think what?

16:20.278 --> 16:25.282
Don't be a dingbat, will ya?
Think. Think
religious thoughts.

16:25.349 --> 16:27.818
Oh, drinking beer, daddy?
That's real religious.

16:27.886 --> 16:31.055
What's the matter with that?

16:31.122 --> 16:33.791
Geez, the Bible's full of wine.

16:33.858 --> 16:38.896
No, God don't have
nothing against taking a drink
to celebrate his son's birthday.

16:38.964 --> 16:43.100
Archie, there's no proof
that Jesus was God's son.
That's-that's fairy tales.

16:43.167 --> 16:46.336
Aw, come on,
you meatheaded atheist you.

16:48.006 --> 16:51.508
Gee. They don't give you
a holiday for fairy tales.

16:57.616 --> 17:01.451
All over the world
they celebrate the birth
of that baby.

17:01.519 --> 17:03.854
And everybody gets time off
from work.

17:03.922 --> 17:07.758
Now if that ain't proof
that he's the son of God,
then nothing is.

17:10.161 --> 17:14.498
Archie, I'm not saying that
a philosopher named Jesus
didn't live in those days.

17:14.565 --> 17:17.067
I'm saying there was
no proof that he was
the son of God.

17:17.135 --> 17:21.137
- Like I said, it's fairy tales.
- The Bible ain't fairy tales
there, meathead.

17:21.204 --> 17:23.573
The Bible is facts all the way,
right from the beginning...

17:23.642 --> 17:27.645
When God made the world
in seven days.
Six days, Archie.

17:27.712 --> 17:32.116
Seven days, Edith.
No. On the seventh day
he rested.

17:32.183 --> 17:34.184
Well, maybe half a day,
Edith,

17:34.252 --> 17:37.420
but the other half
he went around checking
on what he'd done.

17:42.260 --> 17:47.430
And he made us all
one true religion, Edith,
christians,

17:47.498 --> 17:49.499
which he named after
his son, Christian.

17:52.503 --> 17:55.005
Or Christ for short.

17:57.441 --> 18:01.879
I never thought of that.

18:01.946 --> 18:06.616
Certainly. That's the way
it was for a long time.
One religion.

18:06.685 --> 18:12.022
Till they started
splittin' off into all them
other "denumerations" there.

18:12.090 --> 18:15.592
Your catholics,
your "persbytarians."

18:15.660 --> 18:18.996
Lutherans, et cetera,
et cetera.

18:19.064 --> 18:23.533
But there's still only
one true religion to this day,
and that's his religion.

18:23.601 --> 18:26.236
Of course, that's the one
you belong to, right, arch?

18:26.304 --> 18:31.641
I'd be kind of stupid
if I didn't, wouldn't I?
[ Chuckles ]

18:31.710 --> 18:35.713
Yeah, I tell you.
My heart goes out
to a lot of guys I know.

18:35.780 --> 18:41.451
Yeah, they spend their lives
believin' one of them
offshoot religions, you know?

18:41.519 --> 18:45.355
Sendin' their kids to them
there. Givin' 'em money.

18:45.423 --> 18:48.926
Runnin' dances for them.
And then in the end
they get up there...

18:48.993 --> 18:52.495
And they find out
they was foolin' around
with the wrong one all along.

18:55.433 --> 18:58.268
That's sad, you know that?
<i>[ Doorbell ringing ]</i>

down at the youth center.

20:12.277 --> 20:16.446

on our way and leave this off.

21:32.323 --> 21:36.226
Oh, well, Archie got me
a lovely box of--

21:36.294 --> 21:41.331
we all give ourselves kind of
personal items, Mrs. Jefferson.

what Archie gave me.

21:44.903 --> 21:47.905

You don't look too good.

What do you mean?
I feel fine.
I feel just fine.

21:54.345 --> 21:57.014
But, while we're
on the subject of looks,

21:57.081 --> 22:00.951
if you're gonna play
Santa claus, Santa claus
was white and so was his beard.

22:01.019 --> 22:02.852
Told you he'd say that,
Uncle Henry.

22:02.921 --> 22:07.157
That's ridiculous.
I'd look silly
with a white beard.

22:07.225 --> 22:11.128
And who said Santa claus
was white?

22:11.195 --> 22:15.365
Come on, now.
I had the same argument
with you about Jesus.

22:17.701 --> 22:20.037
I hate to go over
old ground again,

22:20.104 --> 22:23.540
but the fact is,
Jesus is white
and so is Santa claus.

22:23.607 --> 22:25.708
Yeah? Let me tell you
something, bunker.
Yeah.

22:25.776 --> 22:31.415
When I was a kid on Christmas
Eve, the guy that used to
fill my stocking was black.

22:31.482 --> 22:33.650
- Let me tell you something--
- we ought to get going.

22:33.717 --> 22:36.453

down at the center, Uncle Henry.
Let's go, ma.

<i>can we go with you?</i>
<i>Yeah, sure. Come on.</i>

Oh, Archie,
wasn't that nice?

23:07.318 --> 23:11.488

What's nice about it?

I didn't know peace
was pinko.

23:31.242 --> 23:35.412
Aw, Edith. Listen, listen.
I wanted to tell you something.

23:35.480 --> 23:37.981
What is it, Archie?

23:38.049 --> 23:41.051
Well, it was about
that thing before--

23:41.119 --> 23:45.955
you want to thank me
for understanding about
your Christmas bonus, don't you?

23:46.024 --> 23:49.359
Why don't you never wait
for me to tell you nothing?

23:51.362 --> 23:54.364
I want to thank you
for understanding about
my Christmas bonus.

23:56.800 --> 24:01.304
See, I didn't want you
to think maybe I got the bonus
and blew it on something else,

24:01.372 --> 24:04.641
or maybe I was like
too stingy to spend it,
you know?

24:04.708 --> 24:08.378
Oh, I never thought that,
Archie.

24:08.446 --> 24:11.848
I guessed that you didn't get
your bonus this year...

24:11.916 --> 24:15.052
Because of that mistake
you made down at the plant.

24:16.887 --> 24:19.056
- You guessed that, huh?
- Well, yeah.

24:19.123 --> 24:24.794
I figured that when you sent
that shipment to London, england
instead of London, Ontario...

24:24.862 --> 24:28.265
They kept your Christmas bonus
as a fine.

24:30.268 --> 24:34.404
Yeah, see, they kept
my Christmas bonus as a fine.

24:35.739 --> 24:38.208
Thank you
for telling me, Archie.
