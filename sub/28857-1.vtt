Yeah, David's coming.

59:16.051 --> 59:17.483
He just,

59:17.485 --> 59:20.186
yeah, he went out to get
Halloween decorations

59:20.188 --> 59:21.857
and a costume apparently.

59:23.225 --> 59:26.226
Yeah, I know it's only September,
but what can I tell you.

59:26.228 --> 59:27.864
He's into all that spooky shit.

59:30.465 --> 59:32.199
Okay, okay, but call me back.

59:32.201 --> 59:34.670
I'm trying to hear about
this guy you're seeing.

59:36.170 --> 59:37.337
I'm not nosy.

59:37.339 --> 59:39.107
I'm just curious.

59:40.342 --> 59:41.208
Alright, alright.

59:41.210 --> 59:42.177
Okay, cool, bye.

01:00:23.851 --> 01:00:24.721
David?

01:00:28.223 --> 01:00:30.523
That is your sad attempt
at trying to frighten me?

01:00:30.525 --> 01:00:31.724
Unoriginal.

01:00:31.726 --> 01:00:33.893
I think I married something
a little more bone chilling

01:00:33.895 --> 01:00:35.464
than a white bed sheet.

01:00:37.465 --> 01:00:39.900
Honestly, David, don't be a
meatball.

01:00:39.902 --> 01:00:42.402
This isn't funny or scary.

01:00:42.404 --> 01:00:45.308
Take off the sheets and
let's go watch Netflix.

David, I'm not in the mood for
this.

My tits are sore, my back aches.

01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:13.302

Baby, if you're in the
mood to be under a sheet,

01:01:29.250 --> 01:01:31.451
why don't we take this to the
bedroom?

01:01:31.453 --> 01:01:33.887
I could put on that little thing
you like

01:01:33.889 --> 01:01:36.392
and we can play naughty
ghost games together.

01:01:40.127 --> 01:01:41.261
Fine, whatever.

01:01:41.263 --> 01:01:43.963
But this is getting really
weird, okay, even for you.

01:01:43.965 --> 01:01:45.264
I know it's almost Halloween

01:01:45.266 --> 01:01:47.132
and you're into all this
horror shit, but I'm not.

01:01:47.134 --> 01:01:48.034
You know that.

01:01:48.036 --> 01:01:49.134
So quit it.

01:01:49.136 --> 01:01:50.005

for fuck's sake, David!

01:01:57.212 --> 01:01:58.078
Is that what you wanted?

01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:59.215
I'm scared now, okay?
