00:04.760 --> 00:07.200
I thought you said you were a beekeeper.

00:07.280 --> 00:09.240
No, a beak keeper.

00:09.320 --> 00:10.360
I keep beaks.

00:10.440 --> 00:12.600
Mmm! It's an impressive collection!

00:12.680 --> 00:15.360
Look, I didn't ask you back to my flat
to look at my beaks.

00:15.760 --> 00:16.800
Of course you didn't.

00:18.840 --> 00:20.040
[Toast yelps]

00:20.680 --> 00:22.640
You don't mind
if I keep my sports vest on, do you?

00:22.720 --> 00:23.760
Fine.

00:26.640 --> 00:28.600
-What's that thing on your leg?
-Oh, nothing.

00:29.720 --> 00:31.000
[Toast] Mmm, mmm!

00:31.600 --> 00:33.240
Won't it get in the way?
What is it exactly?

00:33.320 --> 00:35.360
It's an electronic tag.

00:35.440 --> 00:37.360
-An electronic tag?
-Yeah, it's nothing.

00:37.440 --> 00:39.040
I got into a little scrape with the police

00:39.120 --> 00:41.200
and now I have to wear
an electronic tag on my leg.

00:41.280 --> 00:42.280
It's no big deal.

00:43.080 --> 00:45.840
An electronic tag.
Aren't they for thieves and murderers?

00:45.920 --> 00:49.560
-You've not murdered anyone, have you?
-Not yet. [laughs]

00:49.640 --> 00:51.840
[nervous laughter]
What do you mean, not yet?

00:52.160 --> 00:53.240
'Cause he's in a coma.

00:53.760 --> 00:55.280
It could go either way.

00:55.360 --> 00:58.920
Look, there was a very minor altercation
and someone got stabbed.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.080
I didn't even think
it was worth calling the police!

01:01.160 --> 01:02.440
Who got stabbed?

01:02.520 --> 01:04.720
My boyfriend. It's fine!

01:05.840 --> 01:09.040
That dark stain on your rug,
is that connected with the stabbing?

01:09.120 --> 01:12.600
Yes, it's a bloodstain!
Why are you so interested in this?

01:12.920 --> 01:16.000
I've just realized, I have to be
up really early in the morning

01:16.080 --> 01:18.000
for a... dentist appointment.

01:18.080 --> 01:20.080
I should be going!

01:20.160 --> 01:21.920
-Really?
-Yes.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.880
I hope you're not put off
by the fact that I stabbed my boyfriend.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.000
-Ex-boyfriend, surely?
-That's a discussion

01:27.080 --> 01:29.400
we'll have to have when he wakes up.
That's if he ever does.

01:29.960 --> 01:32.920
I see it as us, sort of, having
a bit of a break from each other.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.760
That's why I think
it's OK for me to see you.

01:35.400 --> 01:36.920
You're pissed off with me, aren't you?

01:37.000 --> 01:38.280
No! No!

01:38.680 --> 01:39.960
I know what you're thinking.

01:40.040 --> 01:42.160
There's another boyfriend on the scene.

01:42.240 --> 01:43.480
He still fancies her.

01:43.560 --> 01:44.880
Maybe she still fancies him.

01:44.960 --> 01:47.400
Where do I fit into all of this,
'cause I really fancy her too?

01:48.760 --> 01:49.880
But don't worry,

01:49.960 --> 01:52.760
because I know that Colin would be cool
about me seeing you.

01:52.840 --> 01:54.520
Anyway, if he's not, fuck him!

01:55.960 --> 01:57.760
I think we should take a break
from each other.

01:58.120 --> 02:00.120
-But I only met you tonight!
-Really?

02:00.200 --> 02:03.080
I'm already on a break from Colin!
I can't take a break from you as well!

02:03.160 --> 02:06.040
Well, maybe we could go for a drink
sometime soon. How would that be?

02:08.520 --> 02:09.840
You'd better fucking ring me.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.400
[sighs]

02:18.360 --> 02:19.360
[knocking at door]

02:22.640 --> 02:24.080
I've forgotten my trousers.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.080
-It's tremendous news!
-So, when did you hear?

02:54.160 --> 02:56.480
Just this morning.
As soon as I got the email, I rang you.

02:56.560 --> 02:57.840
-Can you believe it?
-Mmm.

02:57.920 --> 02:59.360
You've won an award!

02:59.440 --> 03:01.520
After how many years in the industry?

03:01.600 --> 03:04.600
-Ten, fifteen?
-Twenty-eight.

03:04.680 --> 03:08.240
Time to break open the mini champagne!

03:09.040 --> 03:12.240
Now listen,
there's going to be a very big ceremony.

03:12.320 --> 03:15.640
And they're very, very keen
that you accept the award in person.

03:15.720 --> 03:17.920
-[tiny pop]
-This is great, all very exciting.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.440
-What is this magazine?
-Oh, it's called  Bra'z  with a "Z".

03:21.520 --> 03:24.480
It specializes in celebrity titbits
and such.

03:24.560 --> 03:26.480
Bra'z?  Sounds like a bongo mag.

03:26.560 --> 03:28.200
-A what?
-A jazz mag.

03:28.280 --> 03:30.560
-A porno.
-I...

03:30.640 --> 03:34.600
Oh, spare me the confused innocence, Jane.
We're both far too long in the tooth.

03:34.680 --> 03:37.000
It's a celebrity magazine, Toast.

03:37.080 --> 03:40.000
It's read by more people than read
your bingo rag, I'll wager!

03:40.080 --> 03:41.480
What've I won? What's the award for?

03:42.400 --> 03:44.960
-Best actor.
-Hmm!

03:45.040 --> 03:48.320
-[tiny chink of glasses]
-Am I the best actor in Britain

03:48.400 --> 03:49.560
or the world?

03:49.640 --> 03:52.280
I... don't know if they've specified.

03:52.360 --> 03:54.200
I'll assume it's the world.

03:54.280 --> 03:55.320
And what's the timeframe?

03:55.400 --> 03:57.800
Best actor of the year,
the century or of all time?

03:57.880 --> 03:59.320
Toast, just be glad you've won.

03:59.400 --> 04:02.200
Now, do you know Susan Random?

04:02.280 --> 04:03.560
-Nope!
-She's a journalist.

04:03.640 --> 04:06.280
She's absolutely huge on Twitter.
300,000 followers.

04:06.800 --> 04:09.480
Even Jesus didn't have 300,000 followers!

04:12.360 --> 04:13.440
Yeah, I think he did!

04:13.520 --> 04:17.720
Not at the beginning, hm?!
Anyway, she's very keen to meet you.

04:17.800 --> 04:20.120
Big spread in  The Telegraph
and she's paying for lunch!

04:20.200 --> 04:21.760
I absolutely made that clear!

04:21.839 --> 04:25.520
Yeah-ah-ah!
This is all unusually good.

04:25.600 --> 04:28.960
I can't wait to start telling people
that I have...

04:29.040 --> 04:31.480
-...won an award.
-Ah!

04:31.560 --> 04:34.480
Toast, I need to inform you of something.
Do you remember someone

04:34.560 --> 04:37.200
-called Kikini Bamalaam?
-I know the name.

04:37.280 --> 04:38.920
-Kikini Bamalaam?
-Kikini Bamalaam.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.440
-Kikini Bamalaam.
-Stop saying it.

04:40.520 --> 04:42.760
She's the daughter
of the Nigerian Ambassador.

04:42.840 --> 04:45.120
Terrific girl.
Had a bit of a rough time lately.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.920
-I've asked if she'd like to stay here.
-Why?

04:48.000 --> 04:50.600
-She's been recovering from an operation.
-Ah!

04:50.680 --> 04:53.160
Unfortunately, she's addicted to
cosmetic surgery.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.320
Pointless, really,
she's always been very attractive.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.880
But after her last rather painful op,

04:57.960 --> 05:03.040
she's ended up looking very much like...
It's most peculiar.

05:03.120 --> 05:04.480
Well, who? Who does she look like?

05:04.560 --> 05:05.680
Bruce Forsyth.

05:05.760 --> 05:07.760
[snorts] Bruce Forsyth?

05:07.840 --> 05:09.960
Yes. It's quite an uncanny likeness.

05:10.040 --> 05:12.440
They've done a radical makeover
of her entire body.

05:12.520 --> 05:15.840
Except for her left hand. The police
arrived before they got to that.

05:15.920 --> 05:17.600
What, so her hand is still...

05:17.680 --> 05:21.080
Yes. It's the sole reminder
of her quintessential African beauty.

05:21.160 --> 05:23.480
[sighs] It's rather traumatic for Kikini,

05:23.560 --> 05:25.800
because she absolutely hates
Bruce Forsyth.

05:25.880 --> 05:28.200
Although, I must say,
actually, I'm a bit of a fan.

05:28.280 --> 05:30.680
-Well, who isn't? All-round entertainer.
-Yeah.

05:30.760 --> 05:32.920
So what are we talking here?
Palladium  Brucie,

05:33.000 --> 05:35.160
Generation Game  Brucie,
or  Strictly  Brucie?

05:35.240 --> 05:36.760
It's  Generation Game  Brucie.

05:36.840 --> 05:38.440
Oh!

05:38.520 --> 05:40.000
Resembling Brucie from any era

05:40.080 --> 05:42.400
is bound to be traumatic
for an attractive African woman.

05:42.480 --> 05:43.520
Given.

05:43.600 --> 05:46.840
This latest surgeon she went to,
unscrupulous character,

05:46.920 --> 05:49.240
goes by the name of Besus Fufoon.

05:49.320 --> 05:50.440
Besus Fufoon?

05:50.520 --> 05:51.800
Besus Fufoon.

05:51.880 --> 05:54.080
-I haven't heard that name in a while.
-Really?

05:54.160 --> 05:57.840
Besus Fufoon was a pseudonym,
sometimes used by a rival of mine;

05:57.920 --> 06:01.240
a total prat by the name of Ray Purchase.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.600
Ah, yes, third-rate actor, vulgar farces.

06:03.680 --> 06:06.920
That's the one. I've been fucking his wife
on an ongoing basis.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.960
He's never got used to the idea.

06:09.040 --> 06:12.040
So, he's branched into cosmetic surgery
then, has he?

06:12.120 --> 06:14.080
He's probably doing it
just to get back at me.

06:14.160 --> 06:17.480
He's always been very jealous
and a complete tool.

06:17.560 --> 06:19.120
-I see.
-[Toast] That would be right.

06:19.200 --> 06:21.720
I can just picture the scene.

06:21.800 --> 06:25.760
So, you want to look like her.

06:25.840 --> 06:30.120
No problem.
So I'll, um, just inject you with... this.

06:34.800 --> 06:37.160
[evil laugh]

06:43.000 --> 06:46.160
[Ed] So, you think he set himself up
as a rogue cosmetic surgeon

06:46.240 --> 06:48.800
to operate on a friend
of a friend of yours, disfigure her,

06:48.880 --> 06:52.480
and turn her into a Bruce Forsyth
lookalike, just to piss you off?

06:52.560 --> 06:55.640
Yep. Thing is,
I'm not even that pissed off.

07:02.960 --> 07:07.360
Excuse me, which one of you ladies is here
to meet Steven Toast?

07:07.840 --> 07:09.480
Steven, hi.

07:10.560 --> 07:11.560
I'm Susan Random.

07:12.320 --> 07:13.400
I'm Steven Toast!

07:13.480 --> 07:15.920
-Do sit down.
-I intend to.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.840
Thanks for agreeing to the interview.
Would you like a drink?

07:18.920 --> 07:20.960
-Are you having one?
-I'm working.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.040
-Of course.
-If you want one, it's fine.

07:23.120 --> 07:24.840
I hope you're not one of these journalists

07:24.920 --> 07:27.880
who gets their subject sloshed
so they spill the beans,

07:27.960 --> 07:30.640
'cause that isn't gonna happen!

07:34.720 --> 07:36.200
Seems odd that this is an interview,

07:36.280 --> 07:38.400
'cause it's just like chatting
to an old friend.

07:38.480 --> 07:39.520
I feel that too.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.360
I admit I was planning
a bit of a hatchet job,

07:42.440 --> 07:45.600
sort of,
"Steven Toast, he is a massive prick."

07:45.680 --> 07:51.240
But it just seems that
we have so much in common.

07:51.320 --> 07:54.680
-I've got so much in common too!
-Hmm!

07:57.840 --> 08:01.080
Listen,
I have to do this fucking play tonight.

08:01.160 --> 08:02.840
Maybe we could meet tomorrow afternoon?

08:02.920 --> 08:06.080
We could go for a walk.
I live near the canal so...

08:06.160 --> 08:08.200
A walk along the canal! How delightful!

08:08.560 --> 08:11.360
Do you read poetry?
The best poetry is about canals.

08:11.440 --> 08:13.160
I love canal poetry.

08:13.240 --> 08:15.240
The only thing
I don't like about the word canal is

08:15.320 --> 08:17.360
if you remove the "C" it spells "anal."

08:17.880 --> 08:20.040
[laughs]

08:26.080 --> 08:28.720
-[laughs]
-Yes!

08:28.800 --> 08:31.960
[both laugh]

08:37.880 --> 08:39.960
[laughter continues]

08:43.240 --> 08:45.560
-Have to get a bus.
-OK.

08:45.640 --> 08:47.640
-See you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow.

08:47.720 --> 08:48.680
[sighs]

08:54.560 --> 08:56.360
-Hello!
-Jesus Christ!

08:56.440 --> 08:58.560
-You scared the shit out of me.
-Who is she?

08:58.640 --> 09:01.600
She's just a journalist
doing a piece about me. I've gotta go.

09:01.680 --> 09:02.880
-I...
-[beeping]

09:02.960 --> 09:05.280
Oh, damn it, it's my electronic tag.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.600
-I must be beyond the ten-mile zone.
-Really?

09:07.680 --> 09:09.840
Yeah. This must be the line right here.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.040
-[beeping]
-Oh.

09:11.120 --> 09:15.560
-[laughs] Well, it's a great system!
-[Jemima] I hope you're gonna call me!

09:15.640 --> 09:17.720
Absolutely.
As soon as I have a spare moment.

09:17.800 --> 09:18.720
You'd better, Toast!

09:25.880 --> 09:26.880
[Toast] Thank you.

09:26.960 --> 09:30.080
Although I'm honored to receive
this award, it's not a surprise.

09:30.160 --> 09:32.840
-Pleased with your award, are you, Toast?
-Yes!

09:32.920 --> 09:35.360
About bloody time
this industry recognized me.

09:35.440 --> 09:38.840
And to celebrate, I'm planning
a romantic walk along a canal.

09:38.920 --> 09:42.640
Oh, I fell into a canal once, when I was
filming that episode of  Minder.

09:42.720 --> 09:44.040
I was handcuffed to Diana Quick.

09:44.120 --> 09:48.000
Hm-hm! Well, I'll be accompanied
by the delightful Susan Random.

09:48.080 --> 09:50.640
Susan Random, the journalist?
I follow her on Twitter.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.920
I plan to follow her myself,
but not on Twitter,

09:53.000 --> 09:54.640
-just along a canal.
-Excellent!

09:54.720 --> 09:57.000
Why are you dressed
as the man from Del Monte?

09:57.080 --> 09:59.920
-Well, it's for Kikini's imminent arrival.
-I see.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.600
It's absolutely crucial
that we make as little as possible

10:02.680 --> 10:03.800
of the Bruce Forsyth thing.

10:03.880 --> 10:05.080
-Of course!
-[doorbell]

10:05.160 --> 10:06.240
Oh, that'll be her.

10:06.320 --> 10:09.720
Remember, the whole Brucie thing
is strictly off the agenda!

10:09.800 --> 10:11.600
-Most important!
-All right, Ed!

10:13.040 --> 10:16.040
Ah, a canal poem by Susan Random!

10:17.240 --> 10:22.040
"Dear Steven, my favorite place for water
is in a long canal,

10:22.120 --> 10:26.720
although it can be dark and wet,
it never is banal."

10:26.800 --> 10:29.160
Susan, that's beautiful.

10:29.240 --> 10:30.680
[sniffs]

10:30.760 --> 10:32.960
Kikini, this is my flatmate Steven Toast.

10:33.040 --> 10:35.200
Nice to see you, to see you... nice.

10:37.360 --> 10:38.840
Forgive that. Ed did tell me

10:38.920 --> 10:41.160
that to mention any of your catchphrases
was strictly,

10:41.240 --> 10:47.240
strictly, strictly, strictly, strictly,
strictly, strictly, strictly,

10:47.320 --> 10:53.640
strictly, strictly, strictly, strictly,
strictly, strictly... Ooh!

10:54.720 --> 10:56.600
You're not actually anything like him!

10:56.680 --> 11:00.960
-I might need a lie down!
-Yes, you've had a long journey.

11:01.040 --> 11:03.760
-Let me show you to your room.
-What, out this way again, is it?

11:06.720 --> 11:08.800
[exhales] Shit.

11:10.240 --> 11:12.120
[Toast] It was as if I was
in some kind of trance,

11:12.200 --> 11:15.080
but she does look
the spitting image of Bruce Forsyth,

11:15.160 --> 11:17.240
and apparently, she hates him!
[chuckles]

11:17.320 --> 11:19.600
I thought I'd hate you before I met you.

11:19.680 --> 11:23.680
Everyone said to me,
"Oh, Steven Toast? What a cunt."

11:23.760 --> 11:27.400
But you're not. You're really not.

11:30.680 --> 11:31.880
Just a moment.

11:39.920 --> 11:42.520
I'd often wondered how those things
ended up in canals.

11:42.600 --> 11:46.960
Yes! I'm the sort of person who
dumps supermarket trolleys in canals.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.000
I want to know everything about you.

11:49.080 --> 11:50.600
[both laugh]

11:55.680 --> 11:57.840
So, what will you have to drink?

11:57.920 --> 12:01.240
I suppose there is something
I should tell you.

12:01.320 --> 12:04.240
I'm not embarrassed about it,
but I have to let you know.

12:05.240 --> 12:07.560
I'm an alcoholic.

12:07.640 --> 12:10.720
Brilliant! I mean, no one drinks these
days! Let's get a bottle of whisky.

12:10.800 --> 12:13.280
No, Toast, I'm a recovering alcoholic.

12:13.360 --> 12:18.880
I can't drink... ever. It ruined my life.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.200
Well, look, it doesn't matter.

12:20.280 --> 12:23.080
We'll get a bottle of whisky
and I'll drink your half as well.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.320
[Toast laughs]

12:25.000 --> 12:27.400
If I was still drinking,
I wouldn't just drink half a bottle.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.080
Me too, I'd drink the whole bottle.

12:29.640 --> 12:31.360
We have so much in common!

12:31.440 --> 12:32.560
[laughs]

12:32.640 --> 12:36.760
So, apart from throwing shopping trolleys
in canals, being an alcoholic,

12:36.840 --> 12:38.800
you seem refreshingly normal.

12:39.480 --> 12:40.960
So what else should I know about you?

12:41.040 --> 12:42.920
I mean, these things
normally come in threes.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.400
Oh, that's all my skeletons
out the closet, Toast, I promise.

12:46.480 --> 12:47.880
No more surprises. [laughs]

12:47.960 --> 12:52.120
Listen, I have to do that bloody awful
play later, but I'll be free afterwards.

12:52.200 --> 12:54.120
Now, I would invite you around to mine,

12:54.200 --> 12:57.080
but we have that
female Bruce Forsyth lookalike staying.

12:57.160 --> 13:00.320
-So?
-So, is there any room at yours?

13:01.200 --> 13:04.760
-Oh, you mean for... sexy time?
-Well, I, I wouldn't...

13:04.840 --> 13:06.960
-I like sexy time!
-Great.

13:07.360 --> 13:10.080
I can supply my own sheaths.
I do have one rule:

13:10.160 --> 13:13.200
I will not use extra-safe ones.
They're too thick

13:13.280 --> 13:15.600
and I don't believe in putting in
the extra effort, OK?

13:15.680 --> 13:18.200
-All good my end.
-Excellent.

13:18.280 --> 13:21.680
I'd love you to come back,
it's just... my house is a little untidy.

13:21.760 --> 13:22.880
[groans]

13:22.960 --> 13:24.200
Oh, sod it, I'll tidy up.

13:24.280 --> 13:26.720
Um, might need to spend
a bit of time on it, though.

13:26.800 --> 13:30.040
Um. You could come round
tomorrow night?

13:30.120 --> 13:31.600
I'm totally free. Excellent.

13:31.680 --> 13:35.480
Hmm. Just need to pop to the loo.

13:37.040 --> 13:37.880
Ha-ha!

13:38.800 --> 13:41.280
[beeping]

13:44.200 --> 13:45.800
[gasps]

13:45.880 --> 13:48.800
Call you, yes. For a drink, yes.

13:49.320 --> 13:50.960
Yeah, I'll call you.

13:52.920 --> 13:54.160
[toilet flushes]

13:55.320 --> 13:57.520
[Ed] Come back to bed, Kikini!

13:57.600 --> 14:01.240
-Look, I think I'm ready to go again!
-[snorts]

14:02.160 --> 14:04.760
I was just making myself a small sandwich.
Do you want one?

14:04.840 --> 14:06.640
-Well... uh.
-Oh.

14:08.280 --> 14:10.960
I'm not gonna say goodnight
because if I attempt to say anything,

14:11.040 --> 14:14.160
it's just gonna end up being
one of Bruce Forsyth's catchphrases,

14:14.240 --> 14:19.280
like, "I'm in charge," or, "Good game,
good game," or, "Give us a twirl."

14:19.360 --> 14:20.920
So I'll just say nothing.

14:21.560 --> 14:22.880
Ah, shit!

14:26.200 --> 14:28.200
[knife scrapes noisily]

14:43.760 --> 14:44.880
I think I'll have a shower.

14:44.960 --> 14:46.800
-[exhales]
-Yes, of course.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.440
What the hell are you playing at, Ed?

14:56.520 --> 14:58.280
I know, I'm not proud of myself.

14:58.360 --> 15:00.920
It's just...
I've always been a big fan of Bruce.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.480
She's not Bruce Forsyth!

15:02.560 --> 15:05.000
I'm acutely aware how it looks.

15:05.080 --> 15:08.480
The thing is, it's really made Kikini
feel attractive again.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.840
-What?
-I'm just trying to shift the focus away

15:10.920 --> 15:13.280
from her looking like Brucie. In fact,

15:13.360 --> 15:16.160
I think she may be beginning
to quite like the idea.

15:16.240 --> 15:17.880
For fuck's sake!

15:20.040 --> 15:22.680
So, how are you getting on
with Susan Random?

15:22.760 --> 15:24.080
Good.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.880
I'm seeing her again tonight,
going back to her place.

15:26.960 --> 15:29.000
-Really?
-Oh, yes!

15:31.480 --> 15:32.880
Here we are.

15:36.120 --> 15:37.320
[Toast] Good God.

15:40.320 --> 15:41.880
-[exhales]
-Follow me.

15:43.840 --> 15:49.480
[Toast groans] Right behind you.
Not as young as I was.

15:49.560 --> 15:52.440
Heave! Ooh!
-[Susan sighs]

15:53.200 --> 15:55.240
I guessed that
these things normally come in threes.

15:55.320 --> 15:56.640
What do you mean?

15:56.720 --> 15:59.440
Well, you appear to be
one of those extreme hoarders

15:59.520 --> 16:01.840
I've seen those TV programs about.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.400
[Susan] It's just a little untidy!

16:03.480 --> 16:05.600
Honestly, you should've seen
what it was like before.

16:05.680 --> 16:06.800
[groans]

16:06.880 --> 16:09.720
-What's wrong?
-I think I'm stuck!

16:09.800 --> 16:11.720
-Oh!
-[moans]

16:13.040 --> 16:16.360
I'm just going to change into something...

16:17.520 --> 16:21.480
a little more comfortable...
if that's OK?

16:21.560 --> 16:23.720
-Yes!
-[laughs]

16:27.640 --> 16:30.040
-Don't go away!
-[laughs]

16:30.120 --> 16:32.960
[Toast] Not much chance of that!

16:33.040 --> 16:37.000
[Susan] This may take a little while.
[laughs]

16:39.720 --> 16:40.720
[grunts]

16:43.800 --> 16:45.040
[sighs]

16:45.120 --> 16:46.040
[chuckles]

16:47.720 --> 16:49.200
[sighs]

16:49.280 --> 16:50.640
Mmm, yes!

16:50.720 --> 16:54.680
Mmm.
I see you're wearing a sports vest. Mmm.

16:54.760 --> 16:56.640
Mmm!

16:56.720 --> 16:59.360
I would have thought
you'd have got in by now.

16:59.440 --> 17:01.880
If I could, I would.

17:01.960 --> 17:06.000
You're definitely stuck.
I should get help.

17:06.079 --> 17:08.480
Where did I put my phone?

17:08.560 --> 17:10.720
Oh, no, no, no, no!

17:10.800 --> 17:11.800
[sighs]

17:12.040 --> 17:13.680
[beeping]

17:15.720 --> 17:17.079
[screams]

17:17.480 --> 17:19.200
I thought you said
you were going to ring me.

17:19.280 --> 17:22.240
-[beeping continues]
-I think it may be here.

17:25.560 --> 17:28.400
-Are you sleeping with this woman?
-Who is this person, Toast?

17:28.480 --> 17:30.400
Her name's Jemima.
I don't know your full name.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.720
-Jemima Gina
-Meet Susan Random.

17:32.800 --> 17:35.560
-Who is she?
-She's no one! We went out for one night!

17:35.640 --> 17:38.320
It's a bit more than that!
It was a pretty serious relationship!

17:38.400 --> 17:41.200
-We were practically engaged!
-What the fuck are you talking about?

17:41.280 --> 17:42.480
Is this true, Toast?

17:42.560 --> 17:44.640
Of course not! She's a dangerous criminal!

17:44.720 --> 17:48.120
No, I'm not! Anyway, there's going
to be a re-trial! I'll get off!

17:48.200 --> 17:49.800
-Re-trial for what?
-Murder!

17:49.880 --> 17:52.400
Attempted murder, thank you!

17:52.480 --> 17:56.760
I don't know what to say, Toast.
I thought we had so much in common.

17:56.840 --> 18:00.240
-I can't believe you're cheating on me!
-You need to shut your mouth!

18:01.080 --> 18:06.400
So how are we going to resolve this
anyway? I'm very fucking angry about this!

18:06.480 --> 18:08.080
-[sighs]
-[beeping continues]

18:08.160 --> 18:10.080
You keep beaks too!

18:10.160 --> 18:13.680
-[sirens]
-Yes. I've got about 20 boxes of them.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.600
I adore beaks!

18:17.120 --> 18:19.800
I really do. I frame mine.
I've got them on the wall.

18:19.880 --> 18:21.640
-I must have several hundred.
-[Susan] Oh.

18:21.720 --> 18:24.160
I just find them so fascinating,
so fragile.

18:24.240 --> 18:26.400
-Noble.
-I love what you've done to the place.

18:26.480 --> 18:30.640
-Oh, you're so sweet!

We could go to... a hotel?

Oh, I don't think so, Toast.

19:47.600 --> 19:50.040
It's four o'clock in the morning.
You should go home.

19:50.120 --> 19:51.880
-Really?
-Look...

19:51.960 --> 19:54.000
We should take a break from each other.

We've only known each other two days!

19:55.720 --> 20:01.080
To be honest, Toast,
I... think you're a little... weird.

20:01.160 --> 20:03.080
I'm weird?

20:03.160 --> 20:07.640
You're an alcoholic, extreme hoarder,
supermarket trolley-in-the-canal dumper.

20:07.720 --> 20:11.240
However, very attractive.

20:19.800 --> 20:24.920
-[mobile phone rings]
-Toast.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.920
Sorry, Toast, to ring you
at four o'clock in the morning,

20:28.000 --> 20:30.800
but the award ceremony is on tonight.

20:30.880 --> 20:33.680
You are going, aren't you?
They're very keen that you appear.

20:33.760 --> 20:35.560
Yeah, I need cheering up.

20:35.640 --> 20:39.080
-Good. There's just one little thing.
-What?

20:39.160 --> 20:42.240
Well, you know I said
you'd won the award for best actor?

20:42.320 --> 20:45.720
-Yeah.
-Well, it's actually for worst actor.

20:45.800 --> 20:48.840
-Sorry?
-[Jane]  It's actually for worst actor.

20:48.920 --> 20:53.240
It's a kind of...
cheeky award they give out every year.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.520
The finer details
must have been on the attachment

20:55.600 --> 20:57.200
and I don't normally read attachments.

20:57.280 --> 20:59.120
You listen to me,
there's been a change of plan.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.080
I'm not fucking going
to the award ceremony.

21:01.160 --> 21:04.240
And if this wasn't a mobile phone,
I'd be hanging up on you right now.

21:05.200 --> 21:07.840
Hello? [laughs incredulously]

21:09.040 --> 21:11.240
Is everyone enjoying themselves tonight?

21:11.320 --> 21:14.160
-Oh, God, who's this prick?
-[cheers and whoops on TV]

21:14.240 --> 21:19.920
All right and now it's time
to present the award for... worst actor.

21:20.440 --> 21:21.920
And the winner is...

21:22.000 --> 21:24.200
Ah, very well deserved, mate.

21:24.280 --> 21:26.120
-Steven Toast!
-[boos on TV]

21:26.200 --> 21:27.720
[Toast laughs sarcastically]

21:27.800 --> 21:29.200
[presenter]  All right, all right.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.720
Unfortunately,
Steven can't be with us tonight

21:31.800 --> 21:35.320
but he has sent a major celebrity
to collect the award.

21:35.400 --> 21:40.200
-Please welcome Bruce Forsyth!
-[cheering]

21:41.280 --> 21:44.160
Oh, thank you so much. Thank you.

21:45.200 --> 21:48.800
Ah yes, now very sadly,
Steven can't be with us this evening

21:48.880 --> 21:54.040
but I am so pleased to accept this
wonderful award on his behalf.

21:54.120 --> 21:55.840
-[cheering]

21:56.600 --> 21:59.800
That was very good of you
to send Kikini to the awards, Toast.

21:59.880 --> 22:02.000
She looks as though
she's having a tremendous time!

22:02.080 --> 22:04.240
[cheering continues]

22:05.120 --> 22:07.440
Let's have a toast, Toast.
Although I'm not sure

22:07.520 --> 22:10.040
-we're supposed to be celebrating.
-Who cares?

22:11.640 --> 22:12.840
Oh, great.

22:12.920 --> 22:14.080
Didn't she do well?

22:14.160 --> 22:16.200
[both laugh]
