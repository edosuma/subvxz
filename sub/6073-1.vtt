00:57.800 --> 01:03.120
<i>It takes approximately 500
pounds to crush a human skull.</i>

01:03.159 --> 01:07.478
<i>But the human emotion
is a much more delicate thing.</i>

01:20.397 --> 01:24.158
<i>Take Suzy,
my first real girlfriend.</i>

01:24.238 --> 01:26.478
<i>My first real breakup,</i>

01:26.558 --> 01:28.676
<i>happening right in front of me.</i>

01:28.718 --> 01:32.396
<i>I never thought it was going
to be similar to car crash.</i>

01:32.437 --> 01:34.196
<i>I've slammed the brakes,</i>

01:34.238 --> 01:38.236
<i>and I'm skidding towards
an emotional impact.</i>

01:39.997 --> 01:42.130
<i>So is this all my fault?</i>

01:43.996 --> 01:45.837
<i>Me. Ben Willis.</i>

01:48.636 --> 01:53.515
<i>It's funny what goes through
your mind at a time like this.</i>

01:53.555 --> 01:57.075
<i>The two-and-a-half years
we spent together.</i>

01:59.155 --> 02:01.156
<i>The promises we made.</i>

02:04.634 --> 02:08.274
<i>The holidays we took
with her parents.</i>

02:09.674 --> 02:13.235
<i>The lamp we bought
at Ikea together.</i>

02:19.394 --> 02:22.151
<i>It was my final year
at art college.</i>

02:22.193 --> 02:23.832
<i>And in the weeks that
followed the breakup,</i>

02:23.874 --> 02:26.552
<i>I tried to figure out
what went wrong.</i>

02:26.594 --> 02:28.954
<i>Why did we break up?</i>

02:28.993 --> 02:33.391
<i>It's funny, but when I think back
now the reason seems so small.</i>

02:33.433 --> 02:36.791
<i>One day she's with me,
and she's saying “I love you,”</i>

02:36.832 --> 02:40.111
<i>and the next week
she's with someone else.</i>

02:40.153 --> 02:42.670
<i>Probably saying
the same thing.</i>

02:42.712 --> 02:44.983
<i>So did she
really love me?</i>

02:45.753 --> 02:47.791
<i>What is love anyway?</i>

02:47.872 --> 02:50.872
<i>And is it really
that fleeting?</i>

02:53.791 --> 02:56.270
Forget about her.
You don't wanna waste your time

02:56.312 --> 03:00.070
thinking about a girl that dumped you
for a loser like Steve Jenkins.

03:00.112 --> 03:03.030
She didn't dump me.

03:03.110 --> 03:05.390
Why did she
chuck you anyway?

03:06.550 --> 03:08.391
It ended

03:08.470 --> 03:11.509
'cause Suzy thinks the grass is
always greener on the other side.

03:11.550 --> 03:15.469
She's always worrying about there
being a better party to go to.

03:15.511 --> 03:19.030
Or a better boyfriend
to be had.

03:19.109 --> 03:21.950
I just felt I could
never make her happy.

03:25.669 --> 03:28.630
And then Steve Jenkins
started texting her.

03:28.710 --> 03:31.748
How did Steve Jenkins
get her number?

03:31.829 --> 03:33.709
<i>It was a good point.</i>

03:33.749 --> 03:36.509
<i>I only imagined the worst.</i>

03:37.749 --> 03:40.309
I don't want
to think about it.

03:40.348 --> 03:42.987
You need to go out with a beautiful girl.
A model or something.

03:43.028 --> 03:44.709
Why?

03:44.749 --> 03:47.506
Well, because if you've got
a beautiful girl on your arm,

03:47.548 --> 03:49.266
then you must
be worth having.

03:49.308 --> 03:51.426
Women are in competition
with each other, you see.

03:51.468 --> 03:54.146
Suzy sees you with a sexy baby,
she'll think to herself

03:54.188 --> 03:56.226
“if I can get Ben back
from that beautiful girl,

03:56.268 --> 03:59.020
then I must be more
beautiful than her.”

03:59.268 --> 04:03.052
<i>Sean's success with women
was pretty impressive.</i>

04:07.386 --> 04:09.546
It's true.
Ask your mom.

04:11.787 --> 04:15.746
<i>The age-old question.
What is love?</i>

04:15.825 --> 04:18.985
Excuse me.

04:25.106 --> 04:29.184
That's good. That's perfect.

05:00.743 --> 05:04.902
Ben, Mr Adams here
has given his time up for you.

05:04.942 --> 05:09.001
Don't you think we should show him
a little bit of respect?

05:16.941 --> 05:19.662
Excuse me.

05:25.501 --> 05:29.259
<i>I live in student accommodation
not far from the college.</i>

05:29.301 --> 05:31.938
<i>It's basically
a four-story concrete block</i>

05:31.980 --> 05:36.061
<i>housing some 120
hormone-crazed students.</i>

05:43.500 --> 05:45.778
<i>This is the haunting period.</i>

05:45.819 --> 05:49.604
<i>The time when the demons
of regret come for you.</i>

05:51.580 --> 05:53.739
<i>She stood right there</i>

05:53.779 --> 05:56.739
<i>when I said those words:</i>

05:56.819 --> 05:58.098
<i>“I'm sorry.</i>

05:58.179 --> 06:00.897
<i>I don't think
I can make you happy.</i>

06:00.939 --> 06:03.210
<i>Maybe we should break up.”</i>

06:04.618 --> 06:07.164
<i>And that's when
she got angry.</i>

06:30.336 --> 06:32.017
<i>Hello?</i>

06:34.338 --> 06:36.817
Suzy, it's me, Ben.

06:36.897 --> 06:40.735
<i>Ben! I was asleep.
What is it?</i>

06:41.855 --> 06:44.576
Suzy, um…

06:46.495 --> 06:48.696
I'm sorry.

06:48.736 --> 06:50.895
<i>I'm sorry too.</i>

06:54.816 --> 06:58.974
Do you think there's any chance
we'll get back together?

06:59.055 --> 07:01.974
<i>I don't think so, Ben.</i>

07:02.054 --> 07:05.735
<i>I think it ran its course.</i>

07:06.974 --> 07:09.382
<i>Besides,
I'm with Steve now.</i>

07:11.533 --> 07:13.973
Have you
slept with him?

07:15.334 --> 07:16.774
<i>Yes.</i>

07:20.454 --> 07:23.091
Was it good?
I mean, is it better than—

07:23.133 --> 07:26.411
<i>I don't wanna talk
about it with you, Ben.</i>

07:26.452 --> 07:29.812
<i>I've gotta go.
Sorry, Ben.</i>

07:29.893 --> 07:32.373
Suzy?

09:20.005 --> 09:23.243
<i>To think about her now
with someone else,</i>

09:23.285 --> 09:27.758
<i>it felt like all the oxygen
had been sucked from the room.</i>

10:28.040 --> 10:32.400
<i>After my breakup with Suzy,
I just couldn't fall asleep anymore.</i>

10:32.441 --> 10:36.559
<i>The more I tried to sleep,
the less tired I felt.</i>

10:36.639 --> 10:39.240
<i>I was wide awake.</i>

10:39.279 --> 10:41.920
<i>I tried everything.</i>

10:42.000 --> 10:45.439
<i>I'd just become
immune to sleep.</i>

10:47.320 --> 10:50.623
<i>I suddenly found
I had eight extra hours.</i>

10:51.919 --> 10:55.318
<i>My life had been
extended by a third.</i>

10:55.399 --> 10:58.037
<i>I wanted time to pass quickly,
but instead I was forced to witness</i>

10:58.079 --> 11:01.451
<i>the passing of every
second of every hour.</i>

11:03.598 --> 11:05.955
<i>I wanted the hurt I felt
to go away,</i>

11:05.997 --> 11:08.556
<i>but in some cruel trick
of events,</i>

11:08.598 --> 11:11.195
<i>I now had even more time
on my hands.</i>

11:11.237 --> 11:14.758
<i>More time
to think about Suzy.</i>

11:14.838 --> 11:18.484
Would you mind getting out?
Just checking that wheel?

11:32.395 --> 11:36.316
<i>I took the bus
with no real place to go.</i>

11:36.396 --> 11:41.435
<i>I watched the landscape slowly change
as it clung to the last hours of sunlight,</i>

11:41.476 --> 11:45.329
<i>before leaving me to get
another sleepless night.</i>

11:57.715 --> 12:01.552
<i>I started to read all the books
I wished I'd had time to read.</i>

12:01.594 --> 12:06.548
<i>With the extra hours, I even had time
to reread my favorite ones.</i>

12:17.072 --> 12:19.962
<i>But she was never far
from my mind.</i>

13:41.788 --> 13:44.547
Two pounds 75, please.

13:51.267 --> 13:55.187
Ah, how much is it
without these two?

14:02.585 --> 14:03.706
One pound 70.

14:11.545 --> 14:16.293
<i>It was getting obvious that I
needed to trade some of my time.</i>

14:21.264 --> 14:23.984
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:25.785 --> 14:27.304
Yeah, yeah.

14:27.383 --> 14:29.984
Yeah. Yeah.

14:30.063 --> 14:33.904
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
It all looks fantastic, man.

14:35.304 --> 14:37.850
I think you'll fit in
very well here.

14:40.143 --> 14:42.542
It's a great
feeling inside, Ben.

14:45.223 --> 14:47.381
It's marvelous. We hope
you've enjoyed reading about

14:47.422 --> 14:49.781
what it's like to be part
of Sainsbury's and listening.

14:49.822 --> 14:51.581
I know, I've been
through this with you.

14:51.623 --> 14:56.221
There's so many opportunities,
Ben. It's a life thing.

15:02.501 --> 15:06.148
<i>I could feel a faint shift
in a faraway place.</i>

15:07.702 --> 15:11.701
<i>A current of unknown
consequences was on its way</i>

15:11.740 --> 15:16.261
<i>moving towards me like
an unstoppable wave of fate.</i>

15:18.140 --> 15:22.101
T-E-A-M-W-O-R-K. Work.

15:22.180 --> 15:24.221
Teamwork, Ben.

15:25.180 --> 15:27.259
Welcome aboard.

15:46.338 --> 15:50.672
<i>And so I started working
the night shift at Sainsbury's.</i>

15:51.898 --> 15:54.336
<i>During the hours most
normal people are sleeping,</i>

15:54.378 --> 15:56.897
<i>I'm busy trading my time.</i>

15:56.937 --> 16:02.097
<i>I give them my extra eight hours,
and they give me money. Cash back.</i>

16:08.856 --> 16:11.697
–Hi.
–Oh, hi.

16:11.737 --> 16:16.057
I'm late again. Jenkins is gonna
kill me. See you later.

16:16.137 --> 16:17.736
Yeah, see ya.

16:17.816 --> 16:21.016
–Sharon!
–Yes, Mr Jenkins?

16:21.096 --> 16:23.215
–Late again, Sharon.
–I'm sorry, Mr Jenkins.

16:23.257 --> 16:25.694
–Second time this week.
–I know, Mr Jenkins.

16:25.736 --> 16:28.455
I'm sorry,
it won't happen again.

16:28.495 --> 16:29.255
Okay.

16:39.374 --> 16:43.654
<i>My first year at art college
was boring to say the least.</i>

16:43.695 --> 16:46.693
<i>But it helped me to appreciate
the fundamentals of still life.</i>

16:46.734 --> 16:49.572
<i>I'd like to remind the customers
that there's a special</i>

16:49.614 --> 16:53.052
<i>two for the price of one
offer on aisle ten.</i>

16:53.094 --> 16:59.424
<i>Fresh bread and cakes. That's aisle ten
for a special two for the price of one offer.</i>

17:01.454 --> 17:03.894
Well, don't just
stare at it, Ben!

17:05.493 --> 17:06.733
Clean it up.

17:13.893 --> 17:17.250
<i>You see, I've always
wanted to be a painter.</i>

17:17.291 --> 17:19.570
<i>And like many artists
before me,</i>

17:19.612 --> 17:24.359
<i>the female form has always been
a great source of inspiration.</i>

17:28.891 --> 17:33.639
<i>I've always been in awe of the power
they unknowingly possess.</i>

17:35.972 --> 17:39.170
Now, are you going
to clean them up or not?

17:47.091 --> 17:50.609
<i>There is an art to dealing with
the boredom of an eight-hour shift.</i>

17:50.651 --> 17:55.608
<i>An art to putting your mind somewhere else
while the seconds slowly tick away.</i>

17:55.649 --> 17:57.168
<i>I found that all
the people working here</i>

17:57.210 --> 17:59.928
<i>had perfected
their own individual art.</i>

17:59.970 --> 18:02.010
<i>Take Sharon Pintey.</i>

18:02.050 --> 18:05.646
<i>Sharon knows rule number one.
The clock is the enemy.</i>

18:05.688 --> 18:07.688
<i>The basic rule is this:</i>

18:07.729 --> 18:12.133
<i>the more you look at the clock,
the slower the time goes.</i>

18:17.928 --> 18:19.886
<i>It will uncover
the hiding place of your mind</i>

18:19.928 --> 18:22.687
<i>and torture it
with every second.</i>

18:28.007 --> 18:32.686
<i>This is the basic art in dealing
with the trade of your time.</i>

18:36.046 --> 18:37.767
Any cash back?

18:55.966 --> 18:59.165
<i>This is Barry Brickman.</i>

18:59.246 --> 19:04.269
<i>You see, Barry thinks of himself
as a bit of a daredevil stuntman.</i>

19:04.565 --> 19:07.884
<i>For a start,
Barry is quite well-known.</i>

19:07.924 --> 19:10.243
<i>When one of Barry's
bike tricks went wrong,</i>

19:10.285 --> 19:13.313
<i>the cameraman put it
on the internet.</i>

19:14.125 --> 19:17.496
<i>Barry has stuck
to his scooter ever since.</i>

19:18.883 --> 19:22.048
<i>Matt Stephens is also
a king scooterer.</i>

19:26.484 --> 19:29.083
And what was
the other thing?

19:34.002 --> 19:36.842
And what was
the other thing?

19:36.883 --> 19:40.603
–Sausage!
–Oh, yeah.

19:43.723 --> 19:46.241
<i>Now Barry and Matt
are good friends.</i>

19:46.282 --> 19:48.282
There you go.
Take care.

19:48.362 --> 19:51.039
<i>Between them, they have come
up with a very different way</i>

19:51.081 --> 19:53.880
<i>of dealing with
the trade of their time.</i>

19:53.922 --> 19:55.602
Look. Look.

19:57.281 --> 20:01.822
<i>Theirs is an art to finding anything
to do that isn't work.</i>

20:11.000 --> 20:13.719
<i>A few days later,
Barry and Matt were reported</i>

20:13.760 --> 20:17.359
<i>for what they called
“helping the ladies.”</i>

20:19.079 --> 20:22.278
<i>It was these shampoo bottles
that sent them on their quest.</i>

20:22.319 --> 20:24.358
<i>Barry and Matt knew
what they looked like.</i>

20:24.399 --> 20:27.358
<i>And they knew that the women in
the supermarket knew what they looked like.</i>

20:27.400 --> 20:30.158
<i>Their theory was that even
though it was a sex toy</i>

20:30.200 --> 20:31.837
<i>masquerading as
a bottle of shampoo,</i>

20:31.878 --> 20:33.997
<i>women would like
to try it as a sex toy</i>

20:34.038 --> 20:37.477
<i>but were embarrassed to buy it
because they knew what it looked like.</i>

20:37.518 --> 20:42.597
<i>The decision to buy it would be an easier one
if they were already at the checkout.</i>

20:42.638 --> 20:45.037
<i>If they didn't object,
then Barry and Matt knew</i>

20:45.079 --> 20:48.717
<i>they'd helped a bottle
find a happy home.</i>

20:52.678 --> 20:54.916
<i>Barry had challenged Matt
to a scooter race</i>

20:54.958 --> 20:57.436
<i>in which they would sprint
down one aisle and up the next.</i>

20:57.478 --> 21:00.395
<i>They would do all 14 aisles, and
then back to the starting line.</i>

21:00.436 --> 21:03.834
<i>They had been waiting for the day
the manager called in sick.</i>

21:03.876 --> 21:08.915
<i>The art of doing something else other than
the work you're supposed to do, is addictive.</i>

21:08.957 --> 21:10.995
<i>The excitement of doing something
that you shouldn't be doing,</i>

21:11.037 --> 21:13.235
<i>along with the consequences
if you're caught doing it,</i>

21:13.277 --> 21:16.434
<i>are so strong that it often pulls
others away from their own art.</i>

21:16.476 --> 21:20.475
On your marks,
get set, go!

21:28.836 --> 21:30.474
We got winded!

21:40.755 --> 21:43.355
<i>I hadn't slept in two weeks.</i>

21:48.073 --> 21:52.592
<i>My breakup with Suzy had left me with
a sense that time had become unhinged.</i>

21:52.634 --> 21:55.432
<i>I drifted between
imagination and reality,</i>

21:55.473 --> 21:59.120
<i>between past and present
with increasing ease.</i>

22:00.393 --> 22:03.232
I feel like a real man.
You like men.

22:03.312 --> 22:04.751
You like real men,
don't you?

22:04.792 --> 22:06.873
When I'm out there
in the kit,

22:06.953 --> 22:09.912
on the pitch
with the boys,

22:09.993 --> 22:13.472
I look like a god,
I'm an Adonis.

22:26.472 --> 22:30.030
I keep myself
in good shape.

22:30.110 --> 22:34.550
I see the looks.
I ignore them.

22:34.631 --> 22:38.149
<i>I feel the bolts of time slowly
coming away from the breakup.</i>

22:38.191 --> 22:40.909
<i>Time manipulation
is not a precise science.</i>

22:40.950 --> 22:43.988
<i>Like any art,
it's personal to the individual.</i>

22:44.030 --> 22:47.883
<i>So what is the art in making
my shift go so fast?</i>

22:52.029 --> 22:54.350
<i>I imagine the opposite.</i>

22:54.430 --> 22:57.268
<i>That time is frozen.</i>

22:57.348 --> 23:01.669
<i>I imagine the remote control
for life has been paused.</i>

23:34.066 --> 23:38.951
<i>Within this frozen world, I'm able
to walk freely and unnoticed.</i>

23:41.346 --> 23:44.924
<i>Nobody would even know
that time had stopped.</i>

23:51.066 --> 23:53.064
<i>And when it started
back up again,</i>

23:53.106 --> 23:57.823
<i>the invisible join would be seamless
except for a slight shudder.</i>

23:57.865 --> 24:02.406
<i>Not unlike the feeling of somebody
walking over your grave.</i>

24:12.864 --> 24:16.901
<i>That moment when you see someone
walking down the street</i>

24:16.943 --> 24:20.865
<i>who is so beautiful
you just can't help but stare…</i>

24:22.463 --> 24:25.461
<i>Well, imagine as I do,
that with the world on pause</i>

24:25.502 --> 24:29.661
<i>it becomes very easy to understand
the concept of beauty.</i>

24:29.703 --> 24:32.020
<i>To have it frozen
in front of you.</i>

24:32.062 --> 24:33.263
<i>Captured.</i>

24:35.822 --> 24:37.062
<i>Unaware.</i>

24:48.262 --> 24:51.820
<i>For me, this fascination with beauty
started at a very young age.</i>

24:51.862 --> 24:56.179
<i>I was six or seven, and my mom and
dad had taken on a foreign student.</i>

24:56.220 --> 24:57.779
<i>She was in her late teens,</i>

24:57.821 --> 25:00.579
<i>and was studying English
at a nearby school.</i>

25:00.621 --> 25:06.813
<i>Being Swedish, the walk from the shower
to her room didn't need to be a modest one.</i>

25:06.981 --> 25:11.819
<i>It was at that moment that something
very profound happened to me.</i>

25:11.860 --> 25:16.778
<i>I was exposed to the female form
in a way I had never experienced.</i>

25:16.820 --> 25:21.298
<i>I felt fascination and wonder
at the beauty of her nakedness.</i>

25:21.340 --> 25:26.217
<i>And I wanted to freeze the world
so that I could live in that moment for a week.</i>

25:26.259 --> 25:30.379
<i>I have never had a feeling
of such completeness.</i>

25:30.458 --> 25:36.651
<i>To this day I still think it was one
of the most beautiful things I have ever seen.</i>

25:51.177 --> 25:52.737
You dropped these.

26:12.455 --> 26:15.056
<i>And would it be wrong?</i>

26:15.096 --> 26:17.814
<i>Would they hate me
for seeing them?</i>

26:17.855 --> 26:20.195
<i>I mean, really seeing them?</i>

26:25.735 --> 26:31.413
<i>I read once about a woman whose secret fantasy
was to have an affair with an artist.</i>

26:31.455 --> 26:34.613
<i>She thought that he
would really see her.</i>

26:34.655 --> 26:36.934
<i>He would see every curve,</i>

26:37.014 --> 26:40.614
<i>every line,
every indentation,</i>

26:40.653 --> 26:46.089
<i>and love them because they were part
of the beauty that made her unique.</i>

28:57.644 --> 29:00.682
<i>And when I'm ready, all I have
to do to start time again</i>

29:00.724 --> 29:03.203
<i>is crack my fingers.</i>

29:12.924 --> 29:14.444
You look like shit.

29:14.524 --> 29:15.924
Cheers.

29:23.082 --> 29:25.403
–Still not sleeping?
–No.

29:25.442 --> 29:27.640
–Feeling any better about Suzy?
–No.

29:27.682 --> 29:29.240
–Wanna talk about it?
–No.

29:29.282 --> 29:30.761
No? Why?

29:30.842 --> 29:32.639
Because every morning
you come by,

29:32.681 --> 29:35.319
and every morning I talk
about the same thing.

29:35.361 --> 29:38.919
And I'm bored of saying the same thing,
and I'm bored of feeling shit about it.

29:38.961 --> 29:41.800
And most of all I'm bored of
being awake 24 hours a day.

29:41.841 --> 29:45.078
Eew! Look who didn't get out of bed
on the wrong side this morning.

29:45.120 --> 29:47.681
Very funny.

29:47.761 --> 29:50.638
But seriously, you're gonna feel like shit.
It's gonna take time.

29:50.680 --> 29:53.520
For instance, how long ago
did you think about her

29:53.561 --> 29:55.318
before we started having
this conversation?

29:55.360 --> 29:57.679
About ten minutes before
you knocked on the door.

29:57.721 --> 30:00.639
Oh, yeah.
And what was the thought?

30:07.080 --> 30:09.480
I thought about the dust.

30:10.759 --> 30:13.439
The dust?
God, you're weird!

30:13.480 --> 30:16.717
Anyway, whatever. My point is,
every day you think about her

30:16.759 --> 30:19.437
and the things that you associate
with her less and less.

30:19.479 --> 30:21.796
Before long, you'll go a whole day
without thinking about her.

30:21.838 --> 30:23.797
You know what might help
speed up the process?

30:23.839 --> 30:25.079
What?

30:32.437 --> 30:35.836
<i>Me and Sean had been friends
since we were five.</i>

30:35.878 --> 30:39.236
<i>We lived across the street from
one another, and grew up together.</i>

30:39.277 --> 30:41.475
<i>For his 12th birthday,
Sean's mom and dad</i>

30:41.517 --> 30:43.955
<i>had bought him
a state-of the-art computer.</i>

30:43.997 --> 30:46.955
Oh, mom!

30:47.036 --> 30:50.355
Come on, boys, it's a nice day.
Why don't you play in the park?

30:50.397 --> 30:53.716
No. We're okay
playing this.

30:56.997 --> 31:00.781
Okay, I'm off shopping.
You be all right by yourselves?

31:00.836 --> 31:03.435
Yes, mom. Bye, mom.

31:03.475 --> 31:05.555
Bye, Mrs Higgins.

31:05.635 --> 31:07.995
I won't be long.

31:15.034 --> 31:18.834
–Wanna see something?
–What?

31:26.355 --> 31:29.993
–What are they?
–Girls with no clothes on.

31:30.073 --> 31:34.477
<i>Sean had found the magazines
under his mom and dad's bed.</i>

31:34.553 --> 31:38.193
<i>The Swedish student was one thing,
but this was something completely different.</i>

31:38.234 --> 31:41.591
<i>The smiles on the girls' faces
and the total lack of shyness</i>

31:41.633 --> 31:45.150
<i>about what they were showing the camera
was so confusing for me.</i>

31:45.192 --> 31:49.951
<i>I had never seen the female part
up close and in so much detail.</i>

31:49.993 --> 31:52.750
<i>I guess I imagined
something neater,</i>

31:52.792 --> 31:56.110
<i>like a smooth hole
drilled into a piece of wood.</i>

31:56.152 --> 31:58.790
<i>The sort of hole where
you might place a wooden peg.</i>

31:58.831 --> 32:02.429
<i>But the reality was much more
sexually aggressive.</i>

32:02.471 --> 32:04.990
<i>It was hard to imagine
that my teacher, Mrs Booth,</i>

32:05.031 --> 32:08.630
<i>had one under her skirt
that looked just like it.</i>

32:08.672 --> 32:10.632
Mom!

32:16.111 --> 32:17.870
Forgot my purse.

32:20.110 --> 32:22.470
Hey, what have
you two been up to?

32:25.710 --> 32:29.632
<i>After that, Sean's mom
always thought we were gay.</i>

32:30.710 --> 32:33.429
What will help speed up
the process?

32:33.469 --> 32:37.323
You need to distract yourself
with a couple of Natalies.

32:39.549 --> 32:43.546
<i>A Natalie was a term that Sean
had coined for any sexual encounter</i>

32:43.588 --> 32:48.267
<i>that happened with a girl you
weren't in a relationship with.</i>

32:55.708 --> 33:00.265
<i>The term had come from a girl called Natalie
who lived across the street from Sean.</i>

33:00.307 --> 33:05.267
–Hello. Is Natalie in?
–Yeah. Natalie!

33:05.347 --> 33:07.308
–Yeah?
–It's for you.

33:07.388 --> 33:09.385
<i>You see, Sean had
worked out the connection</i>

33:09.427 --> 33:12.465
<i>between the smiling faces
of the girls in the magazines</i>

33:12.507 --> 33:15.426
<i>and the fact that
they were naked.</i>

33:37.185 --> 33:38.824
Fifty p.

33:58.984 --> 34:00.784
That's it.

34:04.944 --> 34:09.485
<i>Natalie became one of the most
popular girls on the street.</i>

34:20.101 --> 34:22.900
<i>Croissants on special offer.</i>

34:34.621 --> 34:36.699
<i>She had
massive tits.</i>

34:40.980 --> 34:42.061
Very funny.

34:42.139 --> 34:44.141
We were only
having a laugh.

34:46.460 --> 34:47.780
Who's that?

34:47.821 --> 34:50.021
That's a new kid.

34:50.061 --> 34:53.299
Apparently he's
a martial arts expert.

34:54.540 --> 34:56.819
Hey, mate!

34:56.899 --> 34:59.259
Come here.

35:04.940 --> 35:07.018
What's your name?

35:07.059 --> 35:09.178
Brian.

35:09.258 --> 35:11.619
Ben says you know
kung fu.

35:11.659 --> 35:14.018
Yeah.

35:14.099 --> 35:17.618
–So you reckon you can have me?
–Yeah.

35:17.658 --> 35:20.179
–Oh, yeah?
–Yeah.

35:20.218 --> 35:23.137
Show us your moves then.

35:37.377 --> 35:39.496
Grab my arm.

35:47.177 --> 35:49.376
That's not funny.

35:53.776 --> 35:54.775
Hi.

35:54.815 --> 35:56.336
Hi, Ben.

35:58.215 --> 36:00.375
You're not
working tonight?

36:00.415 --> 36:03.176
No, I swapped
two hours this week.

36:04.894 --> 36:07.175
Is that a pickle sandwich?

36:07.214 --> 36:10.174
Oh, ah, yeah.

36:10.214 --> 36:12.855
Could I have a bite?
I'm starving.

36:17.415 --> 36:20.414
Mmm. Thanks.

36:23.853 --> 36:26.133
–What?
–You got some there.

36:26.213 --> 36:28.213
–Mmm.
–There.

36:34.453 --> 36:36.453
Let me.

36:40.693 --> 36:42.252
Thanks.

36:49.652 --> 36:52.012
<i>I wanted to freeze time.</i>

36:58.851 --> 37:01.397
<i>I wanted to savor
that moment.</i>

37:04.650 --> 37:07.471
<i>To live in that moment
for a week.</i>

37:07.531 --> 37:09.770
<i>But I couldn't stop it.</i>

37:09.810 --> 37:12.491
<i>Only slow it.</i>

37:13.890 --> 37:17.610
<i>And before I knew it,
she was gone.</i>

37:20.449 --> 37:25.059
<i>After the door closed, I felt like
the last person on earth.</i>

37:42.089 --> 37:44.209
What are you doing?

37:44.289 --> 37:47.366
–Jenkins wanted us to go and fill the shelves.
–So here we are.

37:47.408 --> 37:50.248
Iiiieeee.

37:50.328 --> 37:54.938
Take no notice of him. He's love struck.
He asked Sharon out today.

37:55.008 --> 37:57.887
You did?
What did she say?

37:57.967 --> 38:00.488
She said “Yes.”
He's taking her

38:00.568 --> 38:02.284
to the pictures
tomorrow night.

38:02.326 --> 38:07.927
Then it's back to mine. I'll need about
half an hour to talk away me face.

38:08.006 --> 38:11.807
And then, she's gonna
get some of this.

38:15.006 --> 38:17.605
<i>Crush.</i>

38:17.645 --> 38:20.004
<i>It's funny how the same word
for the feeling of attraction</i>

38:20.046 --> 38:22.404
<i>can be used for the feeling
of disappointment.</i>

38:22.446 --> 38:26.364
<i>The Oxford English dictionary states
one of the meanings for the word crushed</i>

38:26.405 --> 38:30.809
<i>as “a strong and unreasoning,
but transitory attachment.”</i>

38:32.445 --> 38:35.243
<i>I had three crushes
when I was young.</i>

38:35.285 --> 38:38.523
<i>The first was an athlete
called Zola Budd.</i>

38:38.564 --> 38:41.963
<i>She was 18, and looked like a tomboy
with a small, slender frame.</i>

38:42.005 --> 38:45.322
<i>But it was the fact that Zola Budd
defiantly ran barefoot</i>

38:45.364 --> 38:49.010
<i>that made her so completely
attractive for me.</i>

38:49.963 --> 38:53.962
<i>It was the Los Angeles olympics
that would go down in history.</i>

38:54.004 --> 38:59.362
<i>In the 3,000 meter race, Zola Budd
clashed with the American, Mary Decker.</i>

38:59.403 --> 39:03.532
<i>Budd's heart for the race
was left where Decker fell.</i>

39:04.363 --> 39:06.523
<i>Zola finished seventh.</i>

39:06.602 --> 39:09.761
Ben, it's time for bed now.
You've got school tomorrow.

39:09.803 --> 39:12.163
Well, well.
What an upset.

39:12.202 --> 39:16.520
Can somebody tell me something
about the white blood cells? Tim?

39:16.561 --> 39:20.642
Uh, they help fight off bacteria
and germs in the body.

39:20.722 --> 39:22.401
Very well done.

39:22.482 --> 39:23.961
Types…

39:26.202 --> 39:28.241
of cells.

39:28.320 --> 39:32.601
<i>The second crush was for
my biology teacher, Mrs Booth.</i>

39:32.640 --> 39:36.521
Okay, class, who can tell me
something about cells?

39:36.601 --> 39:39.479
<i>She was a confident woman
whose figure-hugging outfits</i>

39:39.521 --> 39:42.040
<i>hinted at the sexiness
that lay hidden beneath.</i>

39:42.081 --> 39:45.998
<i>I imagined Mrs Booth asking me
to stay behind after school</i>

39:46.040 --> 39:48.758
<i>and showing me the same
thing under her skirt</i>

39:48.799 --> 39:52.318
<i>as the girls I'd seen
in the magazines with Sean.</i>

39:52.360 --> 39:56.970
<i>But the main crush I had was
with a girl called Tanya Green.</i>

39:58.078 --> 40:02.157
<i>When I looked at Tanya,
I didn't just see her, I felt her.</i>

40:02.199 --> 40:06.052
The white blood cells and
red blood cells work together.

40:20.117 --> 40:21.797
Oy!

40:25.277 --> 40:29.887
<i>The next day, Tanya caused a
lot of excitement in the class.</i>

40:36.196 --> 40:38.235
<i>Tanya had broken her arm
falling from a swing,</i>

40:38.277 --> 40:40.794
<i>and her cast had caused much excitement
amongst the other kids at the school.</i>

40:40.836 --> 40:43.835
Settle down now,
please, class.

40:44.915 --> 40:46.075
That's enough.

40:46.155 --> 40:48.357
<i>But I saw it differently.</i>

40:48.395 --> 40:51.285
<i>It was the way Tanya dealt with it.</i>

40:52.796 --> 40:55.342
<i>The way she
scratched an itch.</i>

40:57.234 --> 41:00.193
<i>The way it restricted
her movements.</i>

41:00.995 --> 41:07.257
<i>The increasing amount of graffiti that
appeared on it during its six-week life span.</i>

41:07.874 --> 41:10.594
Would you like
to sign it?

41:14.514 --> 41:16.594
Just here.

41:21.393 --> 41:22.795
Thanks.

41:27.873 --> 41:30.392
Go away!
Stop it!

41:33.912 --> 41:36.790
<i>On the day the cast
finally came off,</i>

41:36.832 --> 41:38.471
<i>Tanya's arm
was covered in hair.</i>

41:38.513 --> 41:40.271
Go on back to the jungle.

41:42.432 --> 41:46.870
<i>The six weeks without light had caused
the hair to grow thick and black.</i>

41:46.911 --> 41:49.910
<i>But while the other kids joked
and called her ”monkey,“</i>

41:49.951 --> 41:53.323
<i>it only heightened
my fascination for her.</i>

41:57.911 --> 41:59.270
Don't cry.

42:00.710 --> 42:03.351
You don't have to
worry about them.

42:03.391 --> 42:06.212
I think you're beautiful
the way you are.

42:09.750 --> 42:12.629
Will you be
my girlfriend?

42:14.110 --> 42:15.030
Yes.

42:18.790 --> 42:22.468
<i>There was a place that
I often went to by myself.</i>

42:22.509 --> 42:24.747
<i>It was just
behind the school.</i>

42:24.788 --> 42:28.827
<i>It was close enough to still hear the screams
and shouts of the kids playing their games.</i>

42:28.869 --> 42:32.928
<i>But at the same time,
it felt hidden away from them.</i>

42:34.869 --> 42:37.758
<i>I had arranged
to meet Tanya there.</i>

42:44.068 --> 42:45.148
Whatcha?

42:45.227 --> 42:47.108
Whatcha?

43:01.066 --> 43:02.387
You wanna kiss me?

43:03.706 --> 43:06.345
<i>So this was to be
my first kiss.</i>

43:06.386 --> 43:08.386
Yeah.

43:12.626 --> 43:14.385
Hey! Where you going?

43:15.625 --> 43:18.425
I gotta go.
I'll kiss you tomorrow.

43:18.506 --> 43:22.864
–But tomorrow's Saturday.
–Meet me here at 11:00.

43:29.305 --> 43:32.823
<i>I often came to play around the
school grounds on a saturday.</i>

43:32.864 --> 43:37.062
<i>The familiar building,
so unfamiliar in its quietness.</i>

43:37.103 --> 43:40.200
<i>Peaceful, as if time
had frozen still.</i>

43:54.103 --> 43:57.342
<i>It's like the walls
of this room.</i>

43:57.382 --> 43:59.660
<i>It keeps the whole
building standing.</i>

43:59.702 --> 44:04.381
<i>Tanya's parents had taken her on a
surprise holiday to America.</i>

44:04.423 --> 44:07.179
<i>They set up home there,
and never returned.</i>

44:07.221 --> 44:12.037
<i>It was the first time my heart felt
the other meaning of crush.</i>

44:20.340 --> 44:22.421
Checkmate.

44:22.501 --> 44:26.179
What's wrong with you?
You normally kick my arse at chess.

44:26.221 --> 44:28.740
Have you met someone?

44:30.901 --> 44:32.980
Well, come on.
Give me the juice.

44:33.021 --> 44:36.777
No, it's nothing really.
Just a girl at work I think is nice.

44:36.819 --> 44:40.179
Nice? Nice what?
Nice rack?

44:40.219 --> 44:42.500
No.

44:42.580 --> 44:44.337
Well, yeah,
but nothing like that.

44:44.379 --> 44:48.180
What?
Girlfriend material?

44:48.260 --> 44:50.578
She got small hands?

44:50.658 --> 44:53.697
–What's that got to do with anything?
–Makes your willy look big.

44:53.738 --> 44:55.938
You're such a loser.

44:55.978 --> 44:57.657
So have you asked her out?

44:57.699 --> 45:01.057
–No. Someone already beat me to it.
–Ahh, she got a boyfriend.

45:01.099 --> 45:03.896
No, but one of the guys at work
asked her out. She said “yes.”

45:03.937 --> 45:06.135
They're going
to the pictures tonight.

45:06.177 --> 45:08.336
That doesn't mean
she fancies him.

45:08.377 --> 45:12.850
She might just like him, and want
someone to go to pictures with.

45:14.618 --> 45:18.953
How many girls have you taken
to the pictures and then snogged?

45:20.177 --> 45:22.456
Oh, yeah!

45:29.696 --> 45:33.175
What?

45:34.375 --> 45:36.456
Quite a few.

45:36.536 --> 45:38.695
There you go.

45:43.815 --> 45:45.256
Can I have that?

45:49.374 --> 45:52.495
Yeah, yeah,
that's right, Rory.

45:52.575 --> 45:57.014
Well, of course I played professionally,
before the injury.

45:57.095 --> 45:58.574
Any day, Rory.

45:58.654 --> 46:02.934
You name the date,
me and my boys'll be there.

46:02.974 --> 46:06.173
All right. Sunday.

46:06.214 --> 46:10.574
Just don't go crying
to your mama.

46:14.014 --> 46:15.894
–Ciao.
<i>–Whatever.</i>

46:15.933 --> 46:17.532
Tosser.

46:22.933 --> 46:25.252
Game on.

46:25.332 --> 46:27.733
2,000 feet jump.

46:27.772 --> 46:30.971
Can't beat it.
3,000, kill ya.

46:49.931 --> 46:51.930
There he is!

46:53.370 --> 46:55.009
So, how'd it go
with Sharon?

46:55.051 --> 46:57.371
–Oh, mate!
–So, did ya?

46:57.450 --> 47:00.089
Of course I did.
She loved it.

47:00.170 --> 47:05.328
Couldn't get enough of it. She went like
the toilet door on a bombay shrimp trawler.

47:05.370 --> 47:07.489
–Rack?
–Well, put it this way.

47:07.569 --> 47:10.008
At least you know your kids
will never go hungry.

47:10.050 --> 47:12.330
And?

47:12.370 --> 47:14.529
Like an artist's pocket.

47:18.208 --> 47:20.968
Okay, champs.
Rory Brown.

47:21.048 --> 47:23.127
Manager of
Sainsbury's, Islington,

47:23.169 --> 47:26.884
has challenged us to a football match
on Sunday night.

47:28.608 --> 47:30.727
Finished?

47:30.768 --> 47:32.447
Good.

47:32.528 --> 47:35.526
The reputation of
this supermarket is at stake.

47:35.568 --> 47:39.847
Your reputations, as employees, are at stake.

47:40.967 --> 47:43.366
This is not just
a game of football.

47:43.407 --> 47:46.917
This is what it means to
be a modern-day gladiator!

47:46.967 --> 47:52.086
Now, I want you to think of me
as Russell Crowe.

47:52.167 --> 47:55.526
And you, you're all
the other slaves.

47:55.566 --> 48:00.006
And as slaves,
you will play to the death!

48:00.086 --> 48:04.766
For what happens on Sunday night,
will echo through eternity.

48:09.886 --> 48:14.164
Sunday. 8:00 pm.
Sunny sports center.

48:27.284 --> 48:30.444
You have got to got
to be joking, right?

48:32.883 --> 48:35.083
We're gonna get murdered.

48:38.443 --> 48:40.564
Aaah!

48:46.123 --> 48:47.683
–Hi.
–All right.

48:48.682 --> 48:50.683
Ah, bollocks!

48:50.763 --> 48:54.281
–Playing on this right wing. Like a train, I am.
–Hiya.

48:54.322 --> 48:55.602
Heads up!

48:59.681 --> 49:02.920
Gather round, Whitechapel.
Whitechapel, gather round.

49:02.962 --> 49:06.322
Okay, chaps, this is it!

49:06.361 --> 49:09.441
That is Islington Sainsbury's
over there.

49:09.521 --> 49:14.281
All I can see are
a lot of pretty uniforms.

49:14.361 --> 49:16.641
Take a good look
at one another.

49:16.721 --> 49:19.361
Why?

49:19.441 --> 49:22.481
Natural-born killers!
Every one of you!

49:22.560 --> 49:26.960
So let's get stuck in there
and settle this! Huh? Huh?

49:27.040 --> 49:29.920
Huh?

49:40.240 --> 49:42.997
Hey, Barry, I've got
this really great game.

49:43.038 --> 49:44.478
All right, Rory.

49:44.558 --> 49:46.199
Jenkins.

49:46.279 --> 49:49.399
There's some pretty
uniforms you boys got.

49:49.478 --> 49:53.119
See you've brought
your top team this time.

49:57.037 --> 49:59.198
Looks can be deceiving.

49:59.278 --> 50:03.357
–Well, that's obvious.
–What?

50:03.438 --> 50:06.798
Right. Call.

50:06.878 --> 50:09.157
Heads.
No, tails.

50:09.237 --> 50:12.757
Tails it is.

50:12.797 --> 50:15.836
Come along!

50:23.916 --> 50:25.476
We've got one goal.

50:25.556 --> 50:27.956
All right.
Get in your spaces.

50:31.756 --> 50:34.155
–Ahh!
–Look at that!

50:41.835 --> 50:43.435
Get it!

50:45.194 --> 50:47.715
Come on, take it, come on!

50:53.314 --> 50:55.273
Come on, after it.

51:04.554 --> 51:10.312
I'm playing! I'm playing! The safe keys
are hanging off, on the top shelf!

51:10.353 --> 51:13.313
Get it! Get it!

51:17.872 --> 51:20.473
What?

51:23.271 --> 51:25.951
Triangles!
Triangles!

51:28.671 --> 51:30.951
–Foul!
–No foul! Play on!

51:30.992 --> 51:33.391
Play on, my arse!

51:33.471 --> 51:35.232
I'm all right!

51:35.311 --> 51:38.710
I'm all right!
I'm all right!

51:39.990 --> 51:42.431
What are you doing?

51:42.511 --> 51:44.790
Grow up.
Forget about the money.

51:44.870 --> 51:47.071
What money?
What are you doing?

51:47.111 --> 51:50.669
What am I doing? I'm talking to
an empty phone is what I'm doing,

51:50.710 --> 51:52.708
'cause there's a dead man on
the other end of this fucking line!

51:52.750 --> 51:57.549
–I love that film!
–Pacino. Didn't you hear though?

51:57.630 --> 52:01.964
You oughta see the bank job
shootout scene on me plasma screen!

52:02.830 --> 52:06.228
Come on, Whitechapel,
We can still win this.

52:06.309 --> 52:09.548
–Come on, lads!
–Shoot!

52:09.628 --> 52:12.628
Aye! Dipstick!

52:12.709 --> 52:13.629
Sorry!

52:17.509 --> 52:20.192
The ball, the ball,
the ball, the ball!

52:22.947 --> 52:25.108
For the love of God!

52:30.747 --> 52:32.867
Yeah! Finally!

52:34.428 --> 52:37.666
Oh, my Lord!
Get a life, dipstick!

52:40.746 --> 52:42.826
Time out, ref.
Time out.

52:46.387 --> 52:49.267
Well, chaps,
could be worse.

52:50.866 --> 52:52.864
How could it be worse?
It's 26-nil.

52:52.905 --> 52:54.906
It doesn't matter.

52:54.946 --> 52:59.586
What matters is, there's less
than a minute to play.

52:59.665 --> 53:03.518
And we are not leaving this pitch
until we score a goal!

53:06.145 --> 53:09.585
Matt, get the ball to Ben.

53:11.305 --> 53:14.905
Ben, this is your moment.

53:16.345 --> 53:18.704
I need you.

53:18.744 --> 53:20.743
Get your little legs.

53:20.784 --> 53:25.024
Run up that right flank
like the devil were after you.

53:25.103 --> 53:29.663
I'll be in the center
waiting for your cross.

53:29.743 --> 53:31.944
Use Barry if you need to.

53:32.023 --> 53:34.422
Matt, stay on my left flank.

53:36.183 --> 53:38.543
I need that cross.

53:38.583 --> 53:40.782
I need that ball,

53:40.863 --> 53:43.103
here.

53:44.663 --> 53:46.503
I'll take the shot.

53:46.542 --> 53:51.461
And we, we will
share the glory.

53:52.541 --> 53:54.422
–Got it?
–Yeah.

53:54.502 --> 53:56.581
Now let's score a goal!

53:56.661 --> 54:00.342
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

54:00.422 --> 54:03.620
Come on, boys, come on!

55:05.576 --> 55:08.137
No!

55:24.135 --> 55:25.934
<i>I often wonder
what it would be like</i>

55:25.975 --> 55:28.654
<i>to spend the rest of my life
with the world on pause.</i>

55:28.695 --> 55:32.492
<i>To live out the rest of my life
between two fractions of a second.</i>

55:32.534 --> 55:35.294
<i>To die of old age,
and then have time continue.</i>

55:35.335 --> 55:39.894
<i>The young me gone,
and a dead old man in my place.</i>

56:04.053 --> 56:07.975
<i>Was I spending too much time
in this frozen world?</i>

56:08.652 --> 56:12.132
<i>It felt safe, untouchable.</i>

56:12.173 --> 56:15.892
<i>But how safe
is anyone's world?</i>

56:56.249 --> 56:58.649
Hello?

57:02.408 --> 57:04.489
Anyone there?

57:50.285 --> 57:52.364
<i>It's funny, but the
last thing I imagined</i>

57:52.406 --> 57:56.809
<i>was that maybe I wasn't the
only one who could stop time.</i>

58:07.045 --> 58:09.525
Oh, my God!

58:14.924 --> 58:16.924
You all right?

58:17.003 --> 58:20.375
Don't just stand there!
Drive me to the hospital!

58:21.883 --> 58:24.202
–Can you make sure Sharon gets home all right?
–Yeah.

58:24.243 --> 58:25.323
Cheers, mate.

58:29.723 --> 58:32.082
Right, I'll see
you both tomorrow.

58:32.122 --> 58:34.283
–See ya.
–Bye.

58:41.921 --> 58:43.762
–Thanks.
–Thank you.

58:45.322 --> 58:47.840
I felt that game was
never going to end.

58:47.882 --> 58:51.120
–Matt's face when the ball hit Jenkins.
–Oh, I know.

58:51.161 --> 58:53.019
Do you think
he'll be okay?

58:53.081 --> 58:56.040
It was ego more than
anything, I'd say.

59:01.360 --> 59:04.120
It's probably none
of my business, but,

59:04.161 --> 59:06.279
are you and Matt
seeing each other?

59:06.321 --> 59:10.398
No. We went to the cinema
the other night, but just as friends.

59:10.440 --> 59:12.640
Hmm.

59:12.720 --> 59:15.279
Why? What
has Matt said?

59:15.320 --> 59:18.280
He said he slept with you.

59:20.919 --> 59:25.048
–So you didn't?
–No, of course not! What do you take me for?

59:25.678 --> 59:27.518
Sorry.

59:27.559 --> 59:30.119
Did he say
if I was any good?

59:30.158 --> 59:33.718
I think it was the best sex
he's never had.

59:36.199 --> 59:38.518
So you don't have a boyfriend?

59:38.597 --> 59:41.117
No. We split
about six months ago.

59:41.197 --> 59:43.276
He went off to university
in the States and

59:43.318 --> 59:46.001
it became impossible
to see each other.

59:47.637 --> 59:50.358
And you?
Do you have a girlfriend?

59:50.438 --> 59:52.677
We broke up
a few weeks ago.

59:52.716 --> 59:55.757
I'm sorry.
How are you doing?

59:56.756 --> 59:58.957
Better.

01:00:02.476 --> 01:00:05.677
So how long have you been
at the supermarket?

01:00:05.717 --> 01:00:07.515
'bout two years.

01:00:07.595 --> 01:00:11.594
–Did you get to college?
–I was doing p.t. therapy, but I dropped out.

01:00:11.636 --> 01:00:13.395
Why?

01:00:13.475 --> 01:00:17.233
It wasn't me. And besides,
I needed to start earning money.

01:00:17.275 --> 01:00:19.555
What are you saving for?

01:00:19.635 --> 01:00:21.675
Putting myself
through evening classes.

01:00:21.716 --> 01:00:23.754
Yeah? Studying…

01:00:23.835 --> 01:00:25.194
Spanish.

01:00:25.274 --> 01:00:26.755
Spanish?

01:00:26.835 --> 01:00:28.830
Yeah. What's wrong
with that?

01:00:28.874 --> 01:00:33.835
N-n-nothing. I just wasn't expecting it.
So what can you say?

01:00:37.074 --> 01:00:39.313
Mmm…

01:00:39.393 --> 01:00:42.914
<i>Tu equipo de futbol
es una puta mierda.</i>

01:00:44.113 --> 01:00:45.593
Which means?

01:00:45.674 --> 01:00:49.113
It means your
football team is shit.

01:00:49.913 --> 01:00:52.033
26-nil.

01:00:55.992 --> 01:00:57.473
So why Spanish?

01:00:59.513 --> 01:01:01.792
I've lived here all my life.

01:01:01.872 --> 01:01:05.711
I've worked at the supermarket
for two years and,

01:01:05.752 --> 01:01:08.552
even though
it's happening slow,

01:01:08.632 --> 01:01:13.512
I just feel that my life's ticking away
a second at a time.

01:01:13.591 --> 01:01:18.230
I thought that Spanish would be
one way that I'd be able to find a job
that would involve travel.

01:01:18.271 --> 01:01:23.363
Like being an air hostess or teaching
English at Spanish-speaking schools.

01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:28.751
I've always dreamt of traveling
to far-off places… like South America.

01:01:28.831 --> 01:01:31.927
To places where the sun
kisses every morning.

01:01:31.950 --> 01:01:33.988
But more than that,
I wanna be able

01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:37.828
to talk to people about their lives
and about their dreams.

01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:39.749
Silly, really.

01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:41.550
No, it's not.

01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:44.309
That's your dream.

01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:46.789
Knowing what you want
is half the battle.

01:01:46.830 --> 01:01:49.826
Most people go through their whole lives
not knowing what they want.

01:01:49.868 --> 01:01:53.507
It's easy to find if you know
what you're looking for.

01:01:53.548 --> 01:01:55.586
So what is it that
you're looking for?

01:01:55.628 --> 01:01:58.148
I've always wanted
to be a painter.

01:01:58.228 --> 01:02:01.324
Maybe have my work hung
in a gallery one day.

01:02:01.348 --> 01:02:04.507
I've always wanted
to meet a painter.

01:02:05.748 --> 01:02:07.547
Why?

01:02:08.707 --> 01:02:10.707
Don't know.

01:02:10.748 --> 01:02:16.026
I think it might be something to do
with their ability to see beauty in everything.

01:02:16.068 --> 01:02:19.990
To then capture it, and hang it
on a wall for all to see.

01:02:22.507 --> 01:02:24.586
I find it romantic.

01:02:36.345 --> 01:02:39.186
Well, this is me.

01:02:39.266 --> 01:02:41.506
Number 34.

01:02:41.545 --> 01:02:43.306
Thirty-four.

01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:45.266
It's on the top floor.

01:02:45.306 --> 01:02:46.506
Nice.

01:02:49.825 --> 01:02:50.864
<i>Adios.</i>

01:02:52.104 --> 01:02:53.704
<i>Hasta luego.</i>

01:03:02.583 --> 01:03:04.223
Night, Ben.

01:03:12.303 --> 01:03:14.663
<i>That first kiss.</i>

01:03:14.704 --> 01:03:18.262
<i>I've always made
such a mess of it.</i>

01:03:19.982 --> 01:03:21.103
Come!

01:03:24.502 --> 01:03:28.220
Hiya. I just wanted to know
whether you were all right.

01:03:28.262 --> 01:03:30.502
Oh, yes, yes.
I'm fine.

01:03:30.543 --> 01:03:33.180
'Cause it looked
really painful last night.

01:03:33.222 --> 01:03:36.942
Oh, no.
I've worse than this.

01:03:37.022 --> 01:03:40.102
And the hospital said
you'd be okay?

01:03:40.181 --> 01:03:42.741
Ah, you know.
They said I'd live.

01:03:42.822 --> 01:03:45.461
Are you sure
you're all right?

01:03:45.501 --> 01:03:47.821
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:51.340
Do you know?
I've almost forgot it happened.

01:03:51.421 --> 01:03:54.781
I really can't feel a thing!

01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:57.659
I'm thinking of having
a party on Saturday.

01:03:57.701 --> 01:04:01.500
You know,
cheer everybody up.

01:04:01.539 --> 01:04:05.059
Sure you'll all be there.
Won't you, Sharon?

01:04:05.979 --> 01:04:08.620
Um, yeah.

01:04:09.459 --> 01:04:11.219
Great.

01:04:20.098 --> 01:04:22.298
–Hiya.
–Whatcha?

01:04:22.339 --> 01:04:24.953
Thanks for walking me
home last night.

01:04:25.019 --> 01:04:29.499
That's all right. Thanks for sharing
your dream with me.

01:04:29.538 --> 01:04:32.057
So have you heard
the party rumor?

01:04:32.097 --> 01:04:33.897
No.

01:04:33.977 --> 01:04:36.657
Jenkins' birthday on Saturday.
He's throwing a party.

01:04:36.698 --> 01:04:38.535
We've all got to
be there apparently.

01:04:38.577 --> 01:04:39.777
Oh.

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:43.497
Will you be my date?

01:04:43.577 --> 01:04:45.537
Sharon?

01:04:48.336 --> 01:04:51.417
It's my lunch break.
Can you relieve me?

01:05:01.816 --> 01:05:04.415
So, will you
be my date?

01:05:04.495 --> 01:05:06.176
Yeah.

01:05:07.256 --> 01:05:08.576
Great.

01:05:10.095 --> 01:05:13.056
<i>Shelf stacker to
aisle ten, please.</i>

01:05:13.136 --> 01:05:16.053
<i>Can we have a shelf stacker
to aisle ten?</i>

01:05:16.095 --> 01:05:20.636
<i>Steven, if you're in the shop,
can you report to aisle ten?</i>

01:05:22.534 --> 01:05:25.454
–It's your lunch break.
–No, it's not.

01:05:25.494 --> 01:05:28.865
–It is. It's your lunch break.
–I don't want one.

01:05:32.814 --> 01:05:34.974
Hama-vama!

01:05:46.452 --> 01:05:48.093
Come.

01:05:56.492 --> 01:05:57.972
You wanted to see us?

01:05:58.051 --> 01:05:59.692
Take a chair.

01:06:08.171 --> 01:06:10.291
Not there! Here!

01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:23.810
Now, we were a bit unlucky
last night, chaps.

01:06:23.850 --> 01:06:27.650
But to lighten the mood
and to celebrate my birthday,

01:06:27.690 --> 01:06:30.687
I'm throwing a party at my house
on Saturday night,

01:06:30.729 --> 01:06:32.810
and you're all invited!

01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:37.490
Good!

01:06:37.570 --> 01:06:42.047
Now, no birthday party would be complete
without a surprise stripper.

01:06:42.088 --> 01:06:45.288
And I want one of you
to organize it. Ben.

01:06:45.368 --> 01:06:47.449
Me?

01:06:47.489 --> 01:06:50.008
Yes. Here's 200 quid.

01:06:50.088 --> 01:06:54.688
That should be plenty for some
top-shelf entertainment.

01:06:54.768 --> 01:06:57.605
I'll put the details on the staff board
this afternoon.

01:06:57.647 --> 01:07:00.367
Well, get going then.

01:07:02.888 --> 01:07:06.647
So, where are you
gonna find a stripper?

01:07:06.687 --> 01:07:10.167
I don't know.
But I know a man who will.

01:07:10.247 --> 01:07:15.565
So, your boss has given you 200 quid
to get a surprise stripper for his own birthday.

01:07:15.607 --> 01:07:19.126
I like him! Yeah, I'll help on one condition.

01:07:19.206 --> 01:07:21.204
–What's that?
–I can come to the party.

01:07:21.246 --> 01:07:25.993
–Shouldn't be a problem.
–Cool. Right, let's find you a stripper, eh?

01:07:50.885 --> 01:07:52.245
Two halves, please.

01:08:01.123 --> 01:08:03.124
What was the other one?

01:08:03.204 --> 01:08:04.684
Two halves.

01:08:04.723 --> 01:08:06.524
Oh, yeah.

01:08:06.604 --> 01:08:09.494
I just found the world's
stupidest barman.

01:08:10.922 --> 01:08:14.775
–Sean, I'm not sure about this.
–No, it's gonna be fine.

01:08:17.042 --> 01:08:19.883
That's three quid, mate.

01:08:59.399 --> 01:09:00.399
Yeah!

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:04.479
–How much?
–A quid.

01:09:06.879 --> 01:09:08.957
Each.

01:09:16.037 --> 01:09:18.928
I was, uh, wondering
if you could help us.

01:09:20.839 --> 01:09:24.798
Um, it's his boss's
birthday on saturday,

01:09:24.877 --> 01:09:29.475
and we were looking for someone
who could come and do a surprise, uh, strip.

01:09:29.517 --> 01:09:31.837
I'm busy on Saturday.

01:09:31.917 --> 01:09:36.957
Oh, um, well, do you know anyone
else who might be available?

01:09:37.037 --> 01:09:40.996
I know one.
But she's very expensive.

01:09:41.036 --> 01:09:43.877
That's cool.
Is she here?

01:09:43.957 --> 01:09:47.277
No. She only does
private venues.

01:09:47.357 --> 01:09:50.178
She's gorgeous.
Top of the line, you see.

01:09:51.675 --> 01:09:54.036
Hiya, Ben.

01:10:05.475 --> 01:10:08.474
Will you be my date?

01:10:29.474 --> 01:10:31.874
–Ben!
–Huh?

01:10:31.954 --> 01:10:34.033
–200.
–What?

01:10:34.072 --> 01:10:36.352
200 for the stripper.

01:10:36.433 --> 01:10:38.152
Oh.

01:10:38.232 --> 01:10:40.512
Don't worry, love,
she's class.

01:10:41.553 --> 01:10:43.872
–Okay.
–Great.

01:10:43.952 --> 01:10:45.993
Two tickets
to Pittsburgh!

01:10:51.272 --> 01:10:55.671
<i>It was now my fourth
straight week without sleep.</i>

01:10:55.711 --> 01:11:01.070
<i>I had slowly stopped thinking about Suzy
and had dragged myself into the present.</i>

01:11:01.111 --> 01:11:05.108
<i>The extra eight hours of my life
had done nothing to slow the effect of time.</i>

01:11:05.150 --> 01:11:08.429
<i>The minutes flew into hours,
the hours into days.</i>

01:11:08.471 --> 01:11:12.461
<i>And the days joined
the fast rushing river of time.</i>

01:11:13.471 --> 01:11:16.550
<i>The bad news
is that time flies.</i>

01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:20.109
<i>The good news
is that you're the pilot.</i>

01:11:20.189 --> 01:11:24.455
<i>Most of my shifts were now spent
thinking about Sharon.</i>

01:11:30.349 --> 01:11:33.588
<i>I drew her endlessly.
Over and over.</i>

01:11:34.868 --> 01:11:39.509
<i>Her pale, milky skin.
Her delicate frame.</i>

01:11:43.389 --> 01:11:46.279
<i>In her eyes,
I could see the world.</i>

01:11:48.547 --> 01:11:53.545
<i>I thought about Sharon escaping
the life-sapping neons of the supermarket…</i>

01:11:53.587 --> 01:11:56.308
<i>traveling to South America,</i>

01:11:56.388 --> 01:11:58.907
<i>pursuing her dreams.</i>

01:11:58.987 --> 01:12:01.986
<i>I thought about her
asking me to go with her.</i>

01:12:02.027 --> 01:12:04.826
<i>Both sharing in our dreams.</i>

01:12:04.866 --> 01:12:08.719
<i>Her love of people,
and my love of painting them.</i>

01:12:28.706 --> 01:12:31.464
–You off home?
–Yeah.

01:12:31.505 --> 01:12:35.342
You still wanna be my date for
the party tomorrow night then?

01:12:35.384 --> 01:12:37.025
Yeah, of course.

01:12:37.104 --> 01:12:39.182
Will you come by
and pick me up?

01:12:39.224 --> 01:12:41.024
Yeah.

01:12:41.065 --> 01:12:42.985
8:00?

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:46.343
–Yeah, 8:00.
–Okay. See you tomorrow.

01:12:58.383 --> 01:13:01.182
<i>Sharon had broken the spell.</i>

01:13:01.263 --> 01:13:03.701
<i>For the first time
in weeks, I slept.</i>

01:13:03.743 --> 01:13:07.596
<i>I slept right through
to the following afternoon.</i>

01:13:08.982 --> 01:13:11.182
Mmm. Yeah?

01:13:11.263 --> 01:13:14.541
There's a call for you, Ben.

01:13:19.942 --> 01:13:22.219
–Hello?
<i>–Hello, is this Ben Willis?</i>

01:13:22.261 --> 01:13:23.822
Yeah.

01:13:23.861 --> 01:13:26.820
<i>My name is Alex Prout,
from the Prout gallery.</i>

01:13:26.862 --> 01:13:31.541
<i>I saw some examples of your work
at the university yesterday.</i>

01:13:31.981 --> 01:13:34.220
Y-you did?

01:13:34.261 --> 01:13:39.834
<i>Yes. And I'd be very interested
in putting on a show of your latest works.</i>

01:13:42.461 --> 01:13:43.579
<i>Hello?</i>

01:13:43.659 --> 01:13:46.500
Um, ah, yeah, yeah.
I would love to.

01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:49.538
<i>Great. Why don't you bring some
more examples of your work</i>

01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:52.980
<i>down to my gallery
next Monday? Say 10:00?</i>

01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:55.860
Okay. Thank you.

01:13:55.940 --> 01:13:58.020
No. Thank you, Ben!

01:13:58.099 --> 01:14:01.658
(Bugger off.)
You're the talent.

01:14:07.979 --> 01:14:10.419
Better get ready
for the party.

01:16:10.730 --> 01:16:13.009
<i>–Hello?</i>
–Hey, it's Ben.

01:16:13.049 --> 01:16:15.810
<i>Hi, Ben,
I'll be right down.</i>

01:16:27.448 --> 01:16:28.809
Hiya.

01:16:29.769 --> 01:16:32.169
You look lovely.

01:16:32.249 --> 01:16:34.008
Thanks. You too.

01:16:37.649 --> 01:16:39.007
Are you okay?

01:16:41.088 --> 01:16:42.686
I had some
great news today.

01:16:42.728 --> 01:16:44.248
What?

01:16:44.327 --> 01:16:46.966
There's a gallery interested
in showing my work.

01:16:47.008 --> 01:16:48.927
Ben, that's fantastic!

01:16:49.007 --> 01:16:53.567
Look at you.
You're beaming inside out.

01:16:53.646 --> 01:16:57.606
Wow. You're on your way.

01:17:00.006 --> 01:17:03.007
Well, come on.
Let's go and celebrate.

01:17:35.565 --> 01:17:38.484
We can leave
if you want.

01:17:39.444 --> 01:17:40.884
Welcome!

01:17:41.843 --> 01:17:44.044
Hello, mate.

01:17:44.124 --> 01:17:45.923
Oy.

01:17:46.004 --> 01:17:47.443
Oy.

01:17:47.483 --> 01:17:49.444
–Ben, this is, ah…
–Katrine.

01:17:49.523 --> 01:17:51.323
–Katrink.
–Katrine!

01:17:51.403 --> 01:17:54.243
Katrine. Ben.
This is Sharon. Sean.

01:17:54.322 --> 01:17:56.603
I've heard a lot
about you.

01:17:56.643 --> 01:17:58.400
–Nice to meet you.
–Very sweet.

01:17:58.442 --> 01:17:59.842
Hi.

01:18:01.323 --> 01:18:02.323
Oh, no.

01:18:04.002 --> 01:18:04.922
Hi, Ben.

01:18:05.003 --> 01:18:06.441
–Hi.
–How are you?

01:18:06.522 --> 01:18:10.241
–Uh, good, good. And you?
–Thanks.

01:18:10.322 --> 01:18:12.002
Suzy, this is Sharon.

01:18:12.042 --> 01:18:14.961
–Nice to meet you.
–And you.

01:18:15.002 --> 01:18:18.241
–What are you doing here?
–It's Steve's brother's birthday.

01:18:18.282 --> 01:18:19.841
What, Jenkins?

01:18:19.921 --> 01:18:23.441
Yeah. He's Steve's older brother.
Do you know him?

01:18:23.521 --> 01:18:25.201
Yeah. He's our boss.

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:28.159
–You're working at Sainsbury's?
–Yeah, I work the night shift.

01:18:28.201 --> 01:18:29.840
That's great.

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:33.921
Well, I'd better get back.

01:18:34.001 --> 01:18:35.637
–It was good to see you.
–You too.

01:18:35.679 --> 01:18:38.640
–Nice to meet you.
–You too.

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:44.959
You all right?

01:18:44.999 --> 01:18:47.680
No, that's disgusting.
No, sorry.

01:20:10.713 --> 01:20:13.554
Isn't it great,
your brother's face!

01:20:13.634 --> 01:20:16.034
Come on, Jenkins,
you rotten git!

01:20:16.113 --> 01:20:19.153
Kon-a-nichi-wa!

01:20:19.233 --> 01:20:20.313
Yeah!

01:20:20.391 --> 01:20:21.752
Oh, no!

01:20:56.191 --> 01:20:58.591
–Natalie!
–Sean?

01:20:58.630 --> 01:21:00.830
Who's Natalie?

01:21:00.909 --> 01:21:02.869
It's a long story.

01:21:02.949 --> 01:21:05.948
Well, your act's grown leaps
and bounds since the garage.

01:21:05.989 --> 01:21:08.469
–God, how long ago was that?
–Uh…

01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:16.186
Will you, ah…
Will you stay for a drink?

01:21:16.228 --> 01:21:18.109
Yeah, I'd love to.

01:21:27.068 --> 01:21:29.428
Is this the queue
for the loo?

01:21:38.388 --> 01:21:40.147
Sharon!

01:21:40.227 --> 01:21:42.228
Thanks.
Happy birthday.

01:21:42.267 --> 01:21:44.028
Thanks.

01:21:47.427 --> 01:21:50.866
So, you wanna
come up to my bedroom?

01:21:50.946 --> 01:21:53.466
Eat some popcorn?
Shag?

01:21:53.546 --> 01:21:55.347
No.

01:21:55.427 --> 01:21:58.025
Why? What's the matter?
Don't you like popcorn?

01:21:58.067 --> 01:21:59.826
Barry's gonna do a stunt!

01:21:59.906 --> 01:22:03.743
Barry's gonna do a stunt!
Barry's gonna do a stunt! Everyone!

01:22:03.785 --> 01:22:05.344
No, but seriously
though, Sharon.

01:22:05.385 --> 01:22:07.663
I always thought that one day
you and me might…

01:22:07.705 --> 01:22:09.745
Are you wearing
eyeliner?

01:22:20.425 --> 01:22:21.785
Hey, Ben.

01:22:22.784 --> 01:22:23.905
Hey.

01:22:26.745 --> 01:22:29.542
We really made a mess
of things, didn't we?

01:22:29.583 --> 01:22:32.064
Wasn't that bad.

01:22:32.144 --> 01:22:37.024
I just wanted to say that
I'm sorry about everything.

01:22:37.104 --> 01:22:40.221
I know I never really gave you
a chance to make me happy.

01:22:40.263 --> 01:22:43.661
You can't rely on other people
to make you happy, Suzy.

01:22:43.702 --> 01:22:45.222
I know!

01:22:52.783 --> 01:22:54.182
Is that you?

01:22:55.582 --> 01:22:59.541
Yeah. Jungle survival
course, Mexico.

01:22:59.621 --> 01:23:01.262
But enough about me.

01:23:02.342 --> 01:23:03.781
You.

01:23:04.981 --> 01:23:05.981
You!

01:23:07.422 --> 01:23:09.822
You look…

01:23:09.902 --> 01:23:12.021
gorgeous tonight, Sharon.

01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:28.498
I still think about you
all the time, Ben.

01:23:28.539 --> 01:23:30.620
Why are you
telling me this?

01:23:32.899 --> 01:23:34.220
Have you seen Ben?

01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:37.139
Five! Four!

01:23:37.219 --> 01:23:39.499
Three! Two!

01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:42.098
One! Go!

01:23:43.218 --> 01:23:44.979
No.

01:24:19.336 --> 01:24:22.135
<i>You can speed it up,
you can slow it down.</i>

01:24:22.176 --> 01:24:24.574
<i>You can even
freeze a moment.</i>

01:24:24.616 --> 01:24:26.886
<i>But you can't
rewind time.</i>

01:24:26.896 --> 01:24:29.304
<i>You can't undo
what is done.</i>

01:24:32.216 --> 01:24:35.215
<i>I thought about
what she'd seen.</i>

01:24:35.295 --> 01:24:37.573
<i>I thought about
what she hadn't seen.</i>

01:24:37.615 --> 01:24:39.614
<i>I thought about
how I could explain.</i>

01:24:39.655 --> 01:24:41.973
<i>But the more I thought about it,
the more I knew</i>

01:24:42.015 --> 01:24:45.373
<i>nothing I could say
would make her anger go away.</i>

01:24:45.414 --> 01:24:47.772
<i>How long could
I just wait there</i>

01:24:47.814 --> 01:24:50.015
<i>delaying
the inevitable?</i>

01:24:52.814 --> 01:24:55.212
<i>I had sat there with the world
on pause for two days</i>

01:24:55.254 --> 01:24:57.974
<i>and still
no solution had come.</i>

01:24:58.013 --> 01:25:00.453
<i>I thought about the night
at the sports center</i>

01:25:00.494 --> 01:25:04.348
<i>when I'd seen a person move
when time was frozen.</i>

01:25:04.574 --> 01:25:06.931
<i>If other people could move
within the frozen world,</i>

01:25:06.973 --> 01:25:09.771
<i>then maybe it was something
I could bring Sharon in on.</i>

01:25:09.812 --> 01:25:12.840
<i>It was the best
I could come up with.</i>

01:25:29.091 --> 01:25:30.972
Sharon?

01:25:31.052 --> 01:25:32.732
I'm definitely winded.

01:25:32.812 --> 01:25:36.527
<i>I had forgotten how fast
everything was moving.</i>

01:25:44.850 --> 01:25:46.410
<i>Hello?</i>

01:25:46.491 --> 01:25:48.051
Sharon, it's me.

01:25:50.970 --> 01:25:52.211
Hello?

01:26:34.048 --> 01:26:36.287
<i>This felt familiar.</i>

01:26:41.247 --> 01:26:44.412
<i>I tried to explain
that Suzy was an ex.</i>

01:26:44.486 --> 01:26:47.725
<i>And she had attacked me
when my guard was down.</i>

01:26:47.766 --> 01:26:50.924
<i>Sharon had seen the wrong second
of a two-second story.</i>

01:26:50.966 --> 01:26:53.245
<i>But she wasn't listening.</i>

01:27:59.362 --> 01:28:02.999
<i>Member of cleaning staff
to aisle three, please.</i>

01:28:03.041 --> 01:28:06.137
<i>Cleaning staff
to aisle three quickly.</i>

01:28:41.599 --> 01:28:44.959
–What language is that?
–Russian.

01:28:44.998 --> 01:28:47.318
–Do you speak Russian?
–No.

01:28:47.397 --> 01:28:50.357
Can I get it back
on to English?

01:28:51.998 --> 01:28:53.798
Yep? Can I help you?

01:28:53.878 --> 01:28:55.676
I've got an appointment
with Alex Prout.

01:28:55.718 --> 01:28:57.477
Yeah, that's me.

01:28:57.558 --> 01:28:59.758
Hi. Ben Willis.

01:29:03.116 --> 01:29:05.316
You called me
about my work.

01:29:05.396 --> 01:29:09.037
There must be some mistake.
I've never heard of you.

01:29:10.796 --> 01:29:13.077
You didn't call me?

01:29:23.076 --> 01:29:24.715
Bastards.

01:29:27.035 --> 01:29:30.596
Ah, sorry.
Someone's played a joke on me.

01:29:32.474 --> 01:29:35.501
Well, since you're here,
let me take a look.

01:29:48.513 --> 01:29:50.714
These are yours?
–Yeah.

01:29:57.393 --> 01:29:59.153
You got any more?

01:29:59.193 --> 01:30:01.993
Yeah, I've got hundreds.

01:30:02.072 --> 01:30:03.592
Can you bring them by?

01:30:03.672 --> 01:30:04.792
Sure.

01:30:08.073 --> 01:30:11.101
Why don't you make
an appointment with Lucy.

01:30:11.112 --> 01:30:14.752
Proper one this time.
And we'll take it from there.

01:30:14.791 --> 01:30:16.311
Yeah.

01:30:17.872 --> 01:30:19.711
Ben.

01:30:19.751 --> 01:30:22.352
Ben.
All right, Ben.

01:31:20.027 --> 01:31:22.748
Well done.
Wonderful show.

01:31:22.788 --> 01:31:24.228
Thanks.

01:31:24.307 --> 01:31:28.091
–I'm Anna. Anna Shapiro.
–Ben Willis. Nice to meet you.

01:31:28.107 --> 01:31:30.346
I've got a gallery
in New York.

01:31:30.387 --> 01:31:32.945
I'd be interested to talk
to you about your next show.

01:31:32.987 --> 01:31:34.786
My next show?

01:31:34.867 --> 01:31:37.146
Yes. Any ideas of what
you might like to do?

01:31:37.187 --> 01:31:38.906
Um…

01:31:43.786 --> 01:31:46.676
I'd like to go and paint
in South America.

01:31:47.746 --> 01:31:50.344
Well, that sounds
wonderfully romantic.

01:31:50.386 --> 01:31:53.866
Here. Take my card.

01:31:55.105 --> 01:31:56.185
Call me.

01:31:57.264 --> 01:31:58.385
Well done.

01:32:51.062 --> 01:32:51.982
Hey.

01:32:53.981 --> 01:32:54.941
Hey.

01:32:54.982 --> 01:32:57.701
Congratulations.
This is…

01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:01.061
so great.

01:33:01.141 --> 01:33:02.500
Thanks.

01:33:02.581 --> 01:33:05.780
–How have you been?
–Good.

01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:08.301
I haven't seen you
at work.

01:33:08.381 --> 01:33:11.065
No, I've got a job
at a travel agent's.

01:33:12.499 --> 01:33:15.251
So you're one step closer
to your dream.

01:33:20.259 --> 01:33:23.698
Listen, I'm sorry about
what happened at the party.

01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:27.377
Whether you saw the second after
or not, it doesn't matter.

01:33:27.419 --> 01:33:30.216
I've learned it's what you do with
every single second that counts.

01:33:30.258 --> 01:33:31.938
Shh. It's okay.

01:33:34.019 --> 01:33:37.528
This tells me so much more
than you could ever say.

01:33:45.738 --> 01:33:47.858
It's snowing outside.

01:33:54.777 --> 01:33:56.896
Do you trust me?

01:33:56.936 --> 01:33:58.336
Why?

01:33:59.417 --> 01:34:01.457
I need to know.

01:34:20.936 --> 01:34:23.294
What happened?

01:34:23.374 --> 01:34:26.015
I need to show
you something.

01:34:51.334 --> 01:34:55.612
<i>Once upon a time,
I wanted to know what love was.</i>

01:34:55.693 --> 01:34:58.613
<i>Love is there
if you want it to be.</i>

01:34:58.693 --> 01:35:01.170
<i>You just have to see
that it's wrapped in beauty</i>

01:35:01.212 --> 01:35:05.065
<i>and hidden away between
the seconds of your life.</i>

01:35:08.052 --> 01:35:10.210
<i>If you don't stop
for a minute,</i>

01:35:10.252 --> 01:35:11.972
<i>you might miss it.</i>

01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:08.360
Barry! Barry! Barry! Barry!

01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:11.119
Barry! Ooh! Oh!
