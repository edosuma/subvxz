02:11.865 --> 02:12.832
Oh, God!

02:12.866 --> 02:14.731
What?

02:14.767 --> 02:17.031
Didn't you see that?

02:17.070 --> 02:18.037
There was a dead cat...

02:18.071 --> 02:19.663
hanging from that sign
we just passed.

02:19.706 --> 02:21.640
Really? Cool.

02:23.643 --> 02:26.009
Don't you even think
about going back there.

02:26.045 --> 02:28.673
What color was it?

02:28.715 --> 02:29.909
Tiger-striped.

02:29.949 --> 02:31.041
What difference
does it make?

02:31.084 --> 02:33.279
Well, I thought it might
be black, you know?

02:33.319 --> 02:35.150
Satanists out in the desert.

02:36.356 --> 02:40.156
Marielle said the Nevada desert
was full of oddballs.

02:44.130 --> 02:47.031
I just don't know who could kill
a living creature like that.

02:47.066 --> 02:49.193
You're traveling through
another dimension...

02:49.235 --> 02:52.295
A dimension not only
of sight and sound, but of mind.

02:52.338 --> 02:53.737
Very funny.

02:57.177 --> 03:00.203
I can't wait to get back
to Salt Lake City, at least.

03:00.246 --> 03:02.180
Too much nature out here.

03:02.215 --> 03:05.013
I'm starting to miss civilization.

03:05.051 --> 03:06.211
What? What is it?

03:06.252 --> 03:09.688
A car. Really movin', too.

03:09.722 --> 03:12.850
Get over.
Give him the road.

03:14.827 --> 03:16.590
It's a cop.

03:18.064 --> 03:20.658
Why is he going so fast
with his flashers off?

03:20.700 --> 03:23.100
Who's he gonna
run them for out here?

03:23.136 --> 03:25.263
Well, there's us.

03:29.108 --> 03:31.599
What's he doing?

03:31.644 --> 03:33.271
I don't know.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.255
Hi.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.048
What does he want?

04:10.083 --> 04:12.381
Well, I guess he wants
to get back behind us again.

04:12.418 --> 04:14.318
Well, why didn't
he just pull over...

04:14.354 --> 04:15.912
and let us pass then,
if that's what he wants?

04:15.955 --> 04:17.320
I don't know.

04:25.431 --> 04:27.763
Why is he stopping us,
Peter? Why?

04:27.800 --> 04:30.598
These asses have
a quota to make.

04:30.637 --> 04:32.798
They keep the posted limit at 55
so they can make it.

04:32.839 --> 04:33.806
Don't pull over.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.307
I don't have a choice, Mary.

04:42.615 --> 04:43.912
Great.

04:56.396 --> 04:59.331
Holy God, it's Sasquatch!

05:04.771 --> 05:07.171
Guess I was going
a little fast, officer.

05:07.206 --> 05:09.640
Had the hammer
down a little, huh?

05:13.313 --> 05:16.043
Can I see your registration
please, sir?

05:16.082 --> 05:17.674
No problem.

05:19.052 --> 05:21.520
But the car's not mine.

05:21.554 --> 05:22.612
It's my sister's.

05:22.655 --> 05:26.250
We're driving it back
for her to New York.

05:26.292 --> 05:28.988
She's... she goes
to school in Oregon.

05:29.028 --> 05:30.120
Rand College.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.528
Have you ever heard of it?

05:32.899 --> 05:34.491
Mar, could you get
the registration?

05:34.534 --> 05:36.968
I think it's in
the glove compartment.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.528
I don't believe this...

05:39.572 --> 05:41.062
I can't find my license.

05:42.775 --> 05:44.640
Sorry, officer, I...

05:44.677 --> 05:47.407
Oh, wait a minute, here it is.

05:49.382 --> 05:52.317
OK, and, um, here's
the registration.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.478
Oh, good.

05:53.519 --> 05:54.918
I see you're
an organ donor.

05:56.422 --> 05:58.652
Think that's wise?

05:59.826 --> 06:02.351
Well...

06:10.737 --> 06:13.001
Is there a problem, officer?

06:13.039 --> 06:16.475
Your name is Jackson?

06:16.509 --> 06:20.468
The one on the pink slip
says Deirdre Finney.

06:22.148 --> 06:23.342
That your sister?

06:23.383 --> 06:24.680
Right.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.207
She's been divorced
for about a year...

06:26.252 --> 06:28.777
but she kept
her husband's last name.

06:28.821 --> 06:30.721
Deirdre's a bit of a flake.

06:31.958 --> 06:33.482
Bit of a flake, huh?

06:33.526 --> 06:35.084
Tak.

06:38.398 --> 06:41.390
Can I ask you to step
out of the car, Mr. Jackson?

06:41.434 --> 06:42.526
What for?

06:46.038 --> 06:47.596
Of course.

06:55.281 --> 06:57.715
Come around back, Mr. Jackson.

07:02.789 --> 07:04.882
Hell!

07:04.924 --> 07:07.085
Peter, what is it?

07:07.126 --> 07:10.095
Our...
our damn license plate fell off!

07:10.129 --> 07:11.653
I doubt it.

07:11.697 --> 07:14.063
Did you stop in Fallon?

07:14.100 --> 07:17.365
Yeah, we got gas
at the Conoco there.

07:17.403 --> 07:18.802
Why?

07:18.838 --> 07:21.773
They got some
light-fingered kids hang out there.

07:21.808 --> 07:27.110
I reckon your license plate
is hangin' in their clubhouse right now.

07:27.146 --> 07:29.444
You know this and
it still goes on?

07:29.482 --> 07:31.643
Oh, Fallon is not my place.

07:31.684 --> 07:34.915
Those are not my ways.
Gosh, no.

07:36.222 --> 07:39.248
What should
we do about that, officer?

07:39.292 --> 07:41.226
Well, you just take
the plate off the front...

07:41.260 --> 07:42.386
and put it in the back.

07:42.428 --> 07:43.417
That's should get you
across the country.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.760
You got a tool kit?

07:46.132 --> 07:47.759
These are yours.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.233
Thanks.

07:49.268 --> 07:51.259
I think I saw a tool kit
in the trunk.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.828
Yeah, OK.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.674
There, behind
my make-up case.

08:12.792 --> 08:13.884
Hey.

08:13.926 --> 08:16.053
What is this?

08:19.632 --> 08:21.657
Damned sister!

08:21.701 --> 08:23.066
Officer, I know what
this looks like.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.630
But we checked her stuff...

08:25.671 --> 08:26.865
But we're not
customs officers!

08:26.906 --> 08:28.703
That... that is not our dope!

08:28.741 --> 08:29.969
No.

08:44.390 --> 08:46.551
Let me have your keys.

08:51.998 --> 08:54.330
Get in the car.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.629
But...

08:55.668 --> 08:58.728
Are you deaf?
Get in the car!

08:58.771 --> 09:00.898
Get in the car!

09:03.209 --> 09:06.144
OK, we'll get this
taken care of.

09:06.178 --> 09:08.078
In Desperation.

09:08.114 --> 09:10.048
Get in the car, folks.

09:10.082 --> 09:11.379
Tak.

10:07.039 --> 10:09.405
Slow down,
you'll flip us!

10:20.853 --> 10:23.321
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

10:31.163 --> 10:32.721
Officer, you saw
our registration.

10:32.765 --> 10:35.063
You know that isn't our car,
and it's not our dope either!

10:35.101 --> 10:36.068
Do you think
we'd be so stupid...

10:36.102 --> 10:39.435
Shut up, you
New York deviant.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.635
Wh... wh... what
did you call me?

10:42.675 --> 10:45.508
I'm arresting you
for possession of marijuana...

10:45.544 --> 10:47.535
with intent to sell.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.707
You can't be serious!

10:49.749 --> 10:51.307
You have the right
to remain silent.

10:51.350 --> 10:53.443
If you choose
to not be silent...

10:53.486 --> 10:55.181
everything you say
can be held against you...

10:55.221 --> 10:56.711
In a court of law.

10:56.756 --> 10:57.848
You have the right
to an attorney.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.289
I am going to kill you.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.020
If you cannot
afford an attorney...

11:01.060 --> 11:02.823
One will be
provided for you.

11:02.862 --> 11:03.954
Do you understand
your rights...

11:03.996 --> 11:06.157
as I have explained them
to you?

11:09.068 --> 11:11.468
Do you understand
your rights?

11:11.504 --> 11:13.267
Just... Act normally.

11:13.305 --> 11:15.296
I don't think he understands
what he just said.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.707
Do you understand your rights?!

11:17.743 --> 11:20.211
Do you or not?
Answer me...

11:20.246 --> 11:23.579
you smart-aleck blue state
unisex swingles!

11:23.616 --> 11:27.108
Do you or not?
Do you or not?

11:27.153 --> 11:29.018
Yes! Yes,
we understand.

11:29.055 --> 11:31.046
Please, just watch the road.

11:35.194 --> 11:36.661
Don't worry about me.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.687
I got eyes in the back
of my head.

11:40.900 --> 11:43.528
You'd do well
to remember that.

11:59.351 --> 12:02.184
Up there on the horizon's
the china pit.

12:03.222 --> 12:05.019
Gotta go
all the way to Peru

12:05.057 --> 12:06.490
to find a bigger one.

12:08.294 --> 12:10.558
Yeah, we just started
working her again.

12:10.596 --> 12:13.190
They got some kind
of technology...

12:13.232 --> 12:15.723
that makes even
the tailings valuable.

12:15.768 --> 12:18.328
Science, huh?

12:18.370 --> 12:19.894
Gosh.

12:21.207 --> 12:23.266
Yeah, I think we're gonna
be a boom town again...

12:23.309 --> 12:24.537
just like in the old days.

13:45.357 --> 13:46.881
Officer, please don't kill us.

13:46.926 --> 13:49.793
We'll do whatever you say.
Just don't kill us!

13:49.829 --> 13:52.491
Shut your quackin'
yuppie pothead mouth!

13:52.531 --> 13:54.089
We're not potheads.

13:54.133 --> 13:56.795
You look like potheads to me.

13:58.604 --> 14:00.868
Yuppies killed
Princess Di, you know.

14:00.906 --> 14:02.669
Wasn't she beautiful?

14:02.708 --> 14:03.902
Officer...

14:03.943 --> 14:06.138
Shut up and walk.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.975
Where is everybody?

14:08.013 --> 14:09.571
Disneyland.

14:09.615 --> 14:12.778
Come on, walk,
hay foot, straw foot.

14:14.653 --> 14:16.712
You're Peter.

14:16.755 --> 14:18.780
You're Mary.

14:18.824 --> 14:20.792
So where's Paul?

14:20.826 --> 14:23.454
<i>I mean, how can you sing
Puff the Magic Dragon</i>

14:23.495 --> 14:25.895
without Paul?

14:27.700 --> 14:32.034
Wait a minute.
Peter Jackson.

14:32.071 --> 14:35.268
<i>I love Lord of the Rings!</i>

14:36.308 --> 14:38.776
You are useless.

14:38.811 --> 14:40.870
You at least look healthy.

14:40.913 --> 14:42.574
Get in there, girlfriend.

14:52.424 --> 14:53.789
Forgot all about her.

14:53.826 --> 14:57.227
You can never remember
everything, now can you?

14:58.564 --> 15:02.796
I don't care if you're
a Jew, a Hindu, or Mr. Magoo.

15:02.835 --> 15:04.860
In Desperation...

15:04.904 --> 15:08.738
We don't care about
those things much.

15:19.618 --> 15:22.109
Peter!

15:22.154 --> 15:24.554
Peter! Let me go!

15:24.590 --> 15:26.785
Peter!

15:30.663 --> 15:32.028
Shotgun, get the shotgun!

15:32.064 --> 15:33.053
Shoot him, shoot him!

15:33.098 --> 15:34.998
Get it!
Get it, woman!

15:35.034 --> 15:36.968
Pick it up,
for God sakes!

15:37.002 --> 15:38.094
Don't do that.

15:50.449 --> 15:53.077
Drop it, Mary.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.745
Put it down, Mary.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.516
Put it down.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.250
Drop it.

16:14.306 --> 16:15.295
Now, if you don't
want to see your liver...

16:15.341 --> 16:16.638
come squirting
out of your nose...

16:16.675 --> 16:18.165
I'd put it down, Mary.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.785
Kill me if you're going to.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.762
Now, why would
I want to kill you...

16:42.801 --> 16:44.792
when things are
just starting to get interesting?

16:51.176 --> 16:52.609
He killed my husband!

16:52.644 --> 16:54.703
He killed our little girl.

16:54.747 --> 16:57.648
Three billion red Chinese
don't give a damn.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.548
How they hangin', old timer?

17:07.226 --> 17:10.593
Don't you hurt him!
I'm warning you.

17:10.628 --> 17:12.061
Who are you, boy?

17:12.097 --> 17:14.622
I'm David Carver.

17:14.665 --> 17:18.864
I live at 248 Poplar Street
in Wentworth, Ohio.

17:22.307 --> 17:24.537
Yeah, but...

17:24.576 --> 17:26.373
who made thee?

17:27.679 --> 17:30.546
Canst thou say
who made thee? Tak!

17:32.017 --> 17:35.453
I guess my folks did.

17:35.487 --> 17:36.681
And God.

17:38.557 --> 17:42.653
There's no god
out here, little Dave.

17:42.694 --> 17:45.663
Leave him alone!

17:45.697 --> 17:48.029
Haven't you done
enough to our family?

17:48.067 --> 17:50.900
Even bald-headed
hoppin'-Satan...

17:50.936 --> 17:54.770
don't step his split-foot
much west of Tonopah.

17:54.807 --> 17:56.900
This is Desperation.

17:58.444 --> 18:01.436
Only thing out here
is can tah and can tak.

18:02.714 --> 18:04.909
And don't you forget it!

18:23.602 --> 18:24.796
You're mine.

18:35.581 --> 18:37.742
David, what's wrong?

18:38.851 --> 18:40.079
What's... what's
wrong with him?

18:42.554 --> 18:45.079
There's nothing
wrong with him.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.648
What do you mean?
Are you blind?

18:48.794 --> 18:51.922
I think your son
is praying.

19:27.132 --> 19:30.226
Well. Hey there.

19:30.269 --> 19:32.703
Are you a nice person?

19:34.339 --> 19:36.204
Well, I like to think so...

19:36.241 --> 19:38.072
but, then again,
if I was Ted Bundy...

19:38.110 --> 19:39.441
do you think I'd tell you?

19:39.478 --> 19:42.470
I'd know.
I got a psychic streak.

19:44.550 --> 19:46.541
Up yours!

19:47.619 --> 19:50.053
That's pleasant.

19:50.088 --> 19:51.885
So what's your name,
young lady?

19:51.924 --> 19:53.221
Cynthia Smith.

19:53.258 --> 19:56.557
Smith? Oh. Smith.
That's a likely story.

19:56.595 --> 19:58.688
No, really, it is.

19:58.730 --> 19:59.890
Sure.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.092
Honest!

20:01.133 --> 20:02.122
OK.

20:02.167 --> 20:03.566
Who are you?

20:03.602 --> 20:08.471
Me? Steve Ames.
A noble moniker.

20:08.507 --> 20:12.807
So, haul your psychic
streak on up here...

20:12.844 --> 20:13.833
Cynthia Smith...

20:13.879 --> 20:17.110
And let's make
some miles, OK?

20:17.149 --> 20:19.083
Yeah, I guess you'll do.

20:19.117 --> 20:22.848
Oh. Well, thank you
very much, cookie.

20:22.888 --> 20:26.221
Don't call me cookie,
and I won't call you cake.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.724
Oh, my.

20:36.101 --> 20:38.831
You gonna smoke that
or gum it to death?

20:41.440 --> 20:42.702
Yeah, I quit.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.971
Never hurts to keep
in practice, though.

20:54.820 --> 20:57.015
What you lookin' at, huh?

20:57.055 --> 20:58.613
Your T-shirt.

20:58.657 --> 20:59.624
Yeah, right!

20:59.658 --> 21:01.023
I'm lookin' at your t-shirt!

21:01.059 --> 21:03.050
Come on, that's OK!
We're all animals, right?

21:03.095 --> 21:05.563
Oh, come on, now!
Give me a break.

21:05.597 --> 21:10.296
<i>I worked with Dylan back in '95
when, uh, he did Unplugged.</i>

21:10.335 --> 21:11.302
No way!

21:11.336 --> 21:12.394
Yeah, yeah way. Yeah.

21:12.437 --> 21:14.997
I was doin' amps
and guitar tech...

21:15.040 --> 21:16.302
back in those days.

21:16.341 --> 21:17.740
Are you a roadie?

21:17.776 --> 21:20.244
Well, this truck looks too small
to carry a band's gear.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.406
No, I'm workin'
for this writer...

21:22.447 --> 21:24.540
And he's, uh, he's driving
cross country...

21:24.583 --> 21:27.450
doing little speaking things,
you know?

21:27.486 --> 21:29.511
And he does one
every couple of days or so...

21:29.554 --> 21:31.522
and when he gets back
to the west coast...

21:31.556 --> 21:33.080
he's gonna write a book about it.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.558
Is he famous?

21:34.593 --> 21:38.654
Have you ever heard of
John Edward Marinville?

21:38.697 --> 21:40.631
No.

21:40.666 --> 21:45.501
Well, he's famous
amongst book people, I guess.

21:45.537 --> 21:48.301
Yeah, I pretty much
stick with Dean Koontz.

21:49.841 --> 21:52.469
Is he cool?

21:52.511 --> 21:54.445
Is he cool? Yeah...

21:54.479 --> 21:55.776
you know, once you
get past the ego...

21:55.814 --> 21:58.282
which is like,
the size of Tibet.

21:58.317 --> 22:01.650
Yeah, I mean, he gets cranky
every so often, but I like him...

22:01.687 --> 22:02.711
you know.

22:03.922 --> 22:06.482
People drive across
country everyday.

22:06.525 --> 22:07.549
Why is he writing
a book about it?

22:07.592 --> 22:11.528
Ah, well, it's like he's got
this midlife crisis thing...

22:11.563 --> 22:13.554
You know, the guy's 60 years old.

22:13.598 --> 22:17.864
He's been everywhere,
he's done everyone, you know.

22:17.903 --> 22:21.236
The guy rides a big
Harley soft tail.

22:21.273 --> 22:24.140
Hey, hey! Is his bike
red and cream?

22:24.176 --> 22:25.143
Yeah, red and cream.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.144
I think I saw him
this morning!

22:26.178 --> 22:27.406
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you probably did.

22:27.446 --> 22:28.913
Lookin' all handsome
on his bike.

22:28.947 --> 22:30.278
Handsome man, yeah!

22:30.315 --> 22:32.180
Yeah, and he knows
it, too, believe me.

22:32.217 --> 22:33.309
Well, he's got
to be what...

22:33.352 --> 22:34.319
like, 50, 70 miles ahead of you.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.945
Yeah, about that.

22:35.987 --> 22:38.182
You know, I catch up to him
when he has a gig...

22:38.223 --> 22:41.351
And I set up the sound systems
for him...

22:41.393 --> 22:42.587
And I, you know...

22:42.627 --> 22:45.892
Make sure he's got
the names straight, stuff like that.

22:45.931 --> 22:48.832
And I'll have dinner with him
if he wants somebody to talk to.

22:48.867 --> 22:51.335
Not with, to.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.998
But the guy's having the time
of his life.

22:54.039 --> 22:56.473
Yeah, he likes to play
the lone wolf, huh?

22:56.508 --> 22:59.136
Yeah. That's...
that's the boss.

22:59.177 --> 23:01.407
<i>Lone Wolf McQuade.</i>

23:01.446 --> 23:03.175
A film before your time.

24:21.693 --> 24:24.958
Come on, come on. Go.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.596
Water in the desert.

24:33.939 --> 24:36.635
Thank you, Lord.

24:46.284 --> 24:48.252
You want to
come up here, sir?

24:48.286 --> 24:51.380
I think we need
to have a talk.

24:51.423 --> 24:54.153
Afternoon, officer.

24:59.097 --> 25:00.428
A wise man once told me...

25:00.465 --> 25:02.695
no matter how much
you squirm and dance...

25:02.734 --> 25:05.703
last two drops end up
in your pants.

25:06.805 --> 25:10.400
Sir. Are you aware
that parking your vehicle

25:10.442 --> 25:12.342
on a state road
is against the law?

25:12.377 --> 25:16.211
And that relieving
yourself in public...

25:16.248 --> 25:18.682
is also against the law?

25:20.118 --> 25:24.179
Well, I didn't see any crowd
gathering to watch me, so...

25:24.222 --> 25:25.280
Sir.

25:25.323 --> 25:28.087
Yeah. Well,
listen, you can...

25:28.126 --> 25:29.286
write me up
if you have to...

25:29.327 --> 25:33.821
and I will take it with a smile
and apologize...

25:33.865 --> 25:35.423
if that will
improve your day.

25:35.467 --> 25:37.731
I'm not gonna
write you up, sir.

25:37.769 --> 25:40.033
Just a warning
will do this time, but...

25:45.877 --> 25:48.072
What?

25:48.113 --> 25:49.671
Something wrong?

25:51.016 --> 25:53.382
Holy God.

25:55.220 --> 25:58.053
Holy God!

26:01.092 --> 26:02.992
You're John Edward Marinville,
aren't you?

26:03.028 --> 26:04.996
- Oh, I...
- Damn!

26:05.030 --> 26:06.861
I'm busted.
You got me again.

26:06.898 --> 26:08.763
Damn!

26:08.800 --> 26:09.767
Glad to meet you.

26:09.801 --> 26:10.768
I am shaking hands

26:10.802 --> 26:12.861
<i>With the guy who wrote Delight!</i>

26:12.904 --> 26:14.201
Yeah.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.104
<i>With the guy who wrote
Song of the Hammer!</i>

26:16.141 --> 26:17.403
- Yeah.
- This is...

26:17.442 --> 26:19.569
Wow!

26:22.747 --> 26:24.578
What are you
doing out here?

26:24.616 --> 26:27.176
And on such an unsafe
mode of transportation?

26:27.218 --> 26:29.186
I mean, they don't
call them murder-cycles for nothin'...

26:29.220 --> 26:30.983
and I'm a wolf.

26:31.022 --> 26:33.252
Are you workin'
on anything new, sir?

26:35.126 --> 26:36.787
Yeah, a book of essays.

26:36.828 --> 26:39.023
I thought I'd cycle
across America...

26:39.064 --> 26:40.725
and get in touch
with the common folk.

26:40.765 --> 26:43.632
You know,
get back to my roots.

26:43.668 --> 26:45.465
That's amazing.

26:45.503 --> 26:50.372
Sir, can I
can I have your autograph?

26:51.943 --> 26:54.878
I mean, that'd... that'd...
that'd make my whole day.

26:54.913 --> 26:56.039
Hell, that'd make
my whole year.

26:56.081 --> 26:58.072
Yeah, that'd be fine.
Right here and?

26:58.116 --> 27:00.107
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- All right.

27:00.151 --> 27:04.554
Could you just make it out
to Collie Entragian...

27:04.589 --> 27:08.116
your number one fan.

27:08.159 --> 27:09.683
Thank you.

27:11.029 --> 27:14.829
I heard you saw some
pretty hairy stuff in the 'Nam.

27:14.866 --> 27:17.528
I was just
a correspondent, officer.

27:17.569 --> 27:21.437
Just one more
ink-stained wretch.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.634
But, I must say...

27:23.675 --> 27:26.769
that the Vietnam experience
defined me.

27:26.811 --> 27:29.006
Nobody wrote about
'Nam like you.

27:29.047 --> 27:31.174
I heard you saved some soldiers...

27:31.216 --> 27:34.185
when some suicide gook
blew up a restaurant.

27:36.121 --> 27:41.252
Well, it was gut check time
for a lot of us.

27:41.292 --> 27:42.520
We did what we could.

27:42.560 --> 27:45.529
Yeah, well, some people
don't do anything.

27:45.563 --> 27:47.724
Some made the bread
of forgetfulness...

27:47.766 --> 27:50.326
and drank the wine
of cowardice. Tak.

27:55.006 --> 27:58.305
Hey, you don't want to ride around
like that, Mr. Marinville.

27:58.343 --> 28:00.538
That thing gets caught
up in your back wheel...

28:00.578 --> 28:01.545
you're toast.

28:01.579 --> 28:04.309
How'd that get like that?

28:04.349 --> 28:05.407
It can't be.

28:05.450 --> 28:08.783
I always check these buckles
before I get on the cycle.

28:08.820 --> 28:10.310
It's the last thing I do.

28:10.355 --> 28:13.847
Well, they say the memory's
the first thing to go.

28:13.892 --> 28:15.951
What's that
supposed to mean?

28:24.069 --> 28:26.731
What the hell is that?

28:30.341 --> 28:32.138
That's a wolf!
Shoot it!

28:32.177 --> 28:35.169
Ah, that's just a wild dog.

28:35.213 --> 28:36.908
They're not dangerous.

28:37.916 --> 28:39.850
Ordinarily.

28:39.884 --> 28:41.010
Tak!

28:42.353 --> 28:44.344
Tak ah lah!

28:44.389 --> 28:45.720
Tak ah wah!

28:50.695 --> 28:52.287
What the hell
did you say to it?

28:52.330 --> 28:55.629
Is that some kind
of Indian dialect?

28:55.667 --> 28:57.897
Well, it's a lot
older than that.

29:00.972 --> 29:04.305
Now, since you can't
take care of yourself...

29:04.342 --> 29:06.071
You big baby...

29:07.979 --> 29:09.970
Hey.

29:11.182 --> 29:12.979
Gosh.

29:15.220 --> 29:18.849
Houston, we have a problem.

29:18.890 --> 29:19.879
That's not mine.

29:19.924 --> 29:21.892
You put that in there
when I was off doing my business.

29:21.926 --> 29:23.257
Yeah.

29:23.294 --> 29:27.094
Blame the cop, just like in
your lefty New York stories.

29:27.132 --> 29:28.121
Tak.

29:30.068 --> 29:31.626
Why do you keep
saying that?

29:31.669 --> 29:33.534
Why do you keep
saying "tak"?

29:33.571 --> 29:36.301
I didn't say tak.
You said tak.

29:36.341 --> 29:41.108
You say tomato,
I say tomat-oh.

29:41.146 --> 29:44.877
You say potato,
I say potat-ah.

29:44.916 --> 29:46.281
What the hell's
the matter with you?

29:46.317 --> 29:47.909
Tomato...

29:47.952 --> 29:49.283
Tomat-oh.

29:51.022 --> 29:52.216
Potato.

29:52.257 --> 29:54.384
Potat-oh.

29:54.425 --> 29:57.053
# let's call
the whole thing off #

30:01.266 --> 30:02.563
My nose!

30:03.568 --> 30:05.763
That's not all I'll break.

30:08.706 --> 30:10.333
My children of the desert.

30:10.375 --> 30:14.038
Can toi.

30:14.078 --> 30:17.275
What music they make.

30:19.050 --> 30:20.347
Get up!

30:20.385 --> 30:22.546
On your feet, Lord Jim.

30:22.587 --> 30:25.385
Upsa-daisy, you
worthless piece of crap.

30:25.423 --> 30:27.948
You've been redefined.

30:27.992 --> 30:29.425
Watch what you're
doing to me.

30:29.460 --> 30:30.427
Shut up!

30:30.461 --> 30:32.429
You're in my house now!

30:32.463 --> 30:34.192
You're in the house
of the wolf and the scorpion...

30:34.232 --> 30:35.597
and don't you forget it!

30:37.535 --> 30:41.369
You really did wet
your pants this time.

30:47.512 --> 30:50.208
You're a sorry excuse
for a writer...

30:50.248 --> 30:54.651
and you're a sorry
excuse for a man.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.381
Your whole life is a lie...

30:56.421 --> 30:58.616
and I could just kill
you right here.

32:09.560 --> 32:11.187
Yes.

32:11.229 --> 32:13.220
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

32:16.200 --> 32:17.724
No. No. No. No.

32:17.769 --> 32:20.203
It's still showing.

32:20.238 --> 32:21.705
I can still see it.

32:21.739 --> 32:23.434
Cover it up more!

32:23.474 --> 32:26.170
More, please.

32:26.210 --> 32:27.837
Yes.

32:34.319 --> 32:35.581
Thank you for using Sky.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.110
Your call is now
being routed.

32:37.155 --> 32:38.213
Have a great day.

32:38.256 --> 32:39.280
Oh, damn it.

32:42.994 --> 32:45.929
I was in a literary commune
in Chicago.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.864
Yeah, that's
a new one on me.

32:47.899 --> 32:49.389
Well, when you have
a bunch of people...

32:49.434 --> 32:50.594
sitting around
in a roach motel...

32:50.635 --> 32:53.126
smoking crystal meth,
they're addicts.

32:53.171 --> 32:54.570
- Nice.
- But!

32:54.605 --> 32:57.165
If they've been to college,
they're a literary commune.

32:57.208 --> 32:58.470
For a while, though,
it wasn't bad...

32:58.509 --> 33:01.569
But then I realized
I was getting old before my time.

33:01.612 --> 33:03.773
So, I split.

33:04.816 --> 33:05.908
OK, all right...

33:05.950 --> 33:07.941
Do me a favor.
just don't say anything, OK?

33:07.986 --> 33:10.454
He's... he'll
be cool about it.

33:10.488 --> 33:12.183
But his agent
made a huge stink...

33:12.223 --> 33:15.886
about picking up,
wayward hitchhikers.

33:17.662 --> 33:18.993
Hey, boss, that you?

33:19.030 --> 33:21.225
Steve...
Steve, I'm...

33:21.265 --> 33:22.459
Johnny?

33:22.500 --> 33:23.899
Boss, is that...

33:23.935 --> 33:25.368
Trouble...

33:25.403 --> 33:28.600
I hear you, boss.
What's wrong?

33:31.009 --> 33:32.374
Boss?

33:32.410 --> 33:35.379
About a mile and...
about a mile and a half...

33:35.413 --> 33:37.608
Boss?

33:40.585 --> 33:43.145
Boss? Boss!

33:43.187 --> 33:44.814
Steve...

33:44.856 --> 33:46.289
Boss? Boss?!

33:46.324 --> 33:48.588
Steve, can you...
can you hear me? S...

33:48.626 --> 33:51.117
S...
Shoot.

33:52.497 --> 33:53.794
Lost him.

34:31.735 --> 34:33.135
Miss me?

34:50.822 --> 34:53.188
Where you taking me?

34:53.224 --> 34:56.489
The old calabozo,
my friend...

34:56.527 --> 34:59.360
Where anything you bray
will be abused against you...

34:59.397 --> 35:01.797
in the court of caw.

35:10.575 --> 35:13.066
Well, aren't you going
to at least say gesundheit?

35:17.648 --> 35:19.309
He's in trouble isn't he?

35:20.551 --> 35:22.143
Said something
about the cops.

35:22.186 --> 35:23.949
Oh, God.

35:23.988 --> 35:24.977
Bad.

35:25.022 --> 35:26.580
Not good.

35:26.624 --> 35:28.683
Big ego. Big temper.

35:30.228 --> 35:33.095
Just hope he hasn't
killed anybody.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.929
All right,
brace yourself, Cynthia.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.265
There might be blood.

35:38.302 --> 35:39.792
Yeah, I will.

35:39.837 --> 35:41.236
I'm a woman.

35:41.272 --> 35:42.762
I can deal with blood.

35:53.618 --> 35:55.085
Look, John.

35:57.688 --> 35:59.918
What in the name of God
is going on?

36:11.102 --> 36:13.366
What's up
with the praying, David?

36:13.404 --> 36:16.134
I've been doing it since
Bryan's accident.

36:17.141 --> 36:18.768
Everyone thought he'd die.

36:18.809 --> 36:20.299
Your sister died.

36:20.344 --> 36:21.936
I'd say that's
a pretty lousy bargain.

36:21.979 --> 36:23.139
Honey, leave him alone...

36:23.181 --> 36:24.478
I want to know about this!

36:24.515 --> 36:25.641
He's praying.
That's all.

36:25.683 --> 36:26.980
He's not hurting
anybody.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.144
Praying is great.

36:28.186 --> 36:31.212
Without it, the crusades would've
never gotten off the ground.

36:31.255 --> 36:33.189
Do you do this
all the time, son?

36:33.224 --> 36:34.316
Or is it special?

36:34.358 --> 36:38.124
I ask for help in the morning
and give thanks at night.

36:38.162 --> 36:40.289
In the middle I just
take a few minutes...

36:40.331 --> 36:42.060
and try to...

36:42.099 --> 36:43.794
get open.

36:43.834 --> 36:46.894
Sort of like a football
receiver or something.

36:46.938 --> 36:49.406
It's hard to explain.

36:49.440 --> 36:51.408
Bryan got you going on this?

36:51.442 --> 36:54.275
Bryan's accident.

36:54.312 --> 36:55.836
You remember
the doctor saying...

36:55.880 --> 36:58.576
how his recovery was
almost miraculous?

36:59.850 --> 37:01.545
I saw him, Mom.

37:02.853 --> 37:03.842
It wasn't "almost."

37:11.829 --> 37:13.353
Bryan, look out!

37:20.371 --> 37:22.100
Bryan!

37:22.139 --> 37:23.436
Bryan!

37:31.182 --> 37:33.116
Bryan, are you OK?

37:37.321 --> 37:39.152
Bryan, are you...

37:42.994 --> 37:45.019
Help me! Somebody help me!

37:45.062 --> 37:46.620
I think he's dying!

37:48.499 --> 37:50.091
Come on, please.

37:51.936 --> 37:53.801
God, please don't
let him die.

37:55.906 --> 37:58.568
If you save him,
I'll do something for you.

38:00.177 --> 38:02.111
Anything you want,
I promise.

38:04.315 --> 38:06.044
Only don't let him die.

38:07.151 --> 38:08.846
Please don't let him die.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.051
God could work a miracle
on your friend...

38:12.089 --> 38:14.421
but not on your baby sister?

38:15.926 --> 38:17.757
He couldn't save her
from that cop?

38:19.463 --> 38:21.090
What kind of a god is that?

38:21.132 --> 38:23.828
I don't know what kind
of god he is.

38:23.868 --> 38:24.892
Look, leave him alone.

38:24.935 --> 38:26.197
I want to know how you
can get on your knees...

38:26.237 --> 38:28.762
and pray to a god
who killed your sister!

38:30.841 --> 38:32.001
Lady, he's your son...

38:32.043 --> 38:33.203
and I don't mean
to interfere.

38:33.244 --> 38:36.042
But why don't you take
it easy on the boy?

38:36.080 --> 38:38.446
I know you lost
your little girl.

38:38.482 --> 38:40.006
I lost my husband.

38:40.051 --> 38:42.178
It's been a tough day
on everyone.

38:42.219 --> 38:43.652
Tough day.

38:49.560 --> 38:51.118
Listen.

38:51.162 --> 38:52.720
Maybe it's help.

38:52.763 --> 38:54.663
No. It's Collie.

38:54.699 --> 38:56.860
I recognize the engine.

38:56.901 --> 39:00.564
His name is
Collie Entragian.

39:02.273 --> 39:04.241
He's been on the force
here for...

39:04.275 --> 39:07.574
about 12 years.

39:07.611 --> 39:09.875
I'm... I'm the vet
in these parts...

39:09.914 --> 39:13.213
and I took care of
Collie's dogs.

39:13.250 --> 39:15.241
He was a nice fellow.

39:15.286 --> 39:16.583
Yeah, a real sweetheart.

39:16.620 --> 39:18.588
Till this, I mean.

39:18.622 --> 39:20.920
I'll tell you
something, though.

39:23.394 --> 39:24.793
He's bigger.

39:24.829 --> 39:26.456
What do you mean,
"he's bigger"?

39:26.497 --> 39:27.464
Bigger.

39:27.498 --> 39:29.227
Taller.

39:29.266 --> 39:31.632
A few inches at least.

39:31.669 --> 39:33.762
That's impossible.

39:33.804 --> 39:36.295
I know.

39:44.382 --> 39:45.974
Look at us, would you.

39:46.016 --> 39:48.143
Just one big happy family.

39:48.185 --> 39:50.153
Tak.

40:01.899 --> 40:04.299
I don't even know
what I'm looking for.

40:04.335 --> 40:05.632
His bike...

40:05.669 --> 40:09.571
Skid marks, or just anything
out of the ordinary.

40:09.607 --> 40:12.940
- Wait, wait... what is that?
- What?

40:12.977 --> 40:15.878
He said something about an R.V.

40:15.913 --> 40:17.574
Hey!

40:17.615 --> 40:19.048
What? What is it?

40:20.050 --> 40:22.245
Just a reflection,
I guess. Go slow.

40:52.950 --> 40:54.315
Hello?

40:56.053 --> 40:57.418
Anybody home?

40:58.923 --> 41:00.015
Look.

41:01.325 --> 41:02.792
This is some little
girl's favorite.

41:02.827 --> 41:04.886
See how the dress
is patched?

41:04.929 --> 41:06.760
So why was it left
in the sand?

41:10.968 --> 41:12.299
Yeah. And why...

41:14.605 --> 41:16.971
Why are all the tires flat, you know?

41:17.007 --> 41:20.067
Like, not just one or two
of them, but all of them.

41:57.314 --> 41:59.077
Eeny, meeny, miney, mo.

42:03.220 --> 42:05.745
Catch a tourist by the toe.

42:16.166 --> 42:18.225
Don't you scream.

42:18.269 --> 42:19.702
Don't you shout.

42:23.040 --> 42:24.974
Time has come

42:25.009 --> 42:29.537
to take you... out.

42:29.580 --> 42:30.638
Leave them alone!

42:32.416 --> 42:33.383
Haven't you done
enough to us?

42:33.417 --> 42:34.884
In a word...

42:34.919 --> 42:35.886
No.

42:35.920 --> 42:38.718
Come on out, hon.

42:38.756 --> 42:41.816
Or this no chin,
pencil neck, paper pusher...

42:41.859 --> 42:43.850
gets it right
between the eyes.

42:48.098 --> 42:49.326
Ellie, no.

42:49.366 --> 42:50.697
And the boy goes next.

42:57.041 --> 42:58.531
No!

43:01.278 --> 43:02.905
I'll be all right.

43:02.947 --> 43:04.676
OK.

43:05.683 --> 43:08.618
That's right, hon.

43:08.652 --> 43:10.415
Fine as fiddlesticks.

43:14.558 --> 43:17.891
If you want that...

43:17.928 --> 43:19.759
take me where my son
won't have to see.

43:19.797 --> 43:21.162
Oh, don't worry, hon.

43:21.198 --> 43:23.689
I don't want "that."

43:23.734 --> 43:26.396
Especially not from "you."

43:28.105 --> 43:29.504
Mom, no!

43:29.540 --> 43:30.598
Leave her alone,
you bastard!

43:30.641 --> 43:31.938
Leave my mother alone.

43:31.976 --> 43:34.069
Don't worry, honey.
I'll be back. OK?

43:36.413 --> 43:38.108
Make him stop.
Dad, make him stop.

43:38.148 --> 43:40.116
Oh, God.

43:41.952 --> 43:44.785
I'm warning you.

43:44.822 --> 43:47.052
If you hurt her, you'll be sorry.

43:47.091 --> 43:49.389
Maybe.

43:49.426 --> 43:51.018
But I doubt it.

43:52.663 --> 43:55.461
You're just a little
prayboy, aren't you?

43:55.499 --> 43:57.558
Yes, yes, you are.

43:57.601 --> 44:01.560
You just little prayboy
in a baseball shirt.

44:01.605 --> 44:04.733
Well, go ahead and pray.

44:04.775 --> 44:06.504
See what good it does.

44:06.543 --> 44:09.512
But God ain't here
any more than he was...

44:09.546 --> 44:13.448
when Jesus was dying
on the cross with flies in his eyes.

44:13.484 --> 44:14.473
Tak!

44:18.889 --> 44:20.652
Tak! Ah lah!

44:22.326 --> 44:24.920
Him en tow!

44:28.866 --> 44:31.096
If you set a hand
or a foot outside your cell...

44:31.135 --> 44:33.126
he'll have it off before you
even know it was gone.

44:33.170 --> 44:34.228
Leave her alone.

44:34.271 --> 44:35.966
Son!

44:36.006 --> 44:38.566
I will put a stick through
your mother and spin her...

44:38.609 --> 44:41.578
until she catches fire
if I so desire.

44:41.612 --> 44:43.011
And you'll not stop me.

44:44.515 --> 44:46.005
And I'll come back for you.

44:49.053 --> 44:50.315
Collie!

44:52.823 --> 44:53.983
Don't hurt her!

45:02.599 --> 45:04.760
Carver. Carver.

45:23.687 --> 45:26.713
Well, there was boy here
as well as a girl.

45:26.757 --> 45:30.818
David Carver. Carver.

45:30.861 --> 45:32.692
What do you got?

45:32.730 --> 45:33.856
Jewelry.

45:33.897 --> 45:35.296
Earrings and rings.

45:35.332 --> 45:37.857
You know, not Tiffany,
but not cheap either.

45:37.901 --> 45:39.198
Not the kind of stuff
you'd leave behind...

45:39.236 --> 45:41.329
unless you were in a hurry.

45:44.641 --> 45:46.131
Time for the cops, isn't it?

45:46.176 --> 45:48.144
Well, I'm pretty sure
the boss said something...

45:48.178 --> 45:49.941
about being like
a mile from the R.V.

45:49.980 --> 45:52.039
So...

45:52.082 --> 45:54.050
Before we start
yelling for the cops...

46:20.377 --> 46:21.605
You're crazy.

47:01.251 --> 47:02.775
Cynthia!

47:56.473 --> 47:59.169
Why are you
taking me here?!

48:10.554 --> 48:13.216
It's beautiful, isn't it?

48:30.674 --> 48:32.403
Oh, God.

48:32.442 --> 48:33.807
Please, don't kill me.

48:35.679 --> 48:36.839
Just...

48:51.595 --> 48:53.927
Now what?

48:53.964 --> 48:56.262
Well, there's a town
not too far far east of here...

48:56.300 --> 48:58.131
Desperation.

48:58.168 --> 48:59.692
They got some cute names
out here, don't they?

48:59.736 --> 49:01.533
Yeah, I don't
care about the name.

49:01.571 --> 49:03.835
I just care about if they have
at least one working phone...

49:03.874 --> 49:06.206
and maybe
one working cop.

49:06.243 --> 49:08.438
Yeah.
Wouldn't that be nice.

49:38.742 --> 49:40.607
# Mother Mary #

49:40.644 --> 49:42.202
# What's the story #

49:42.245 --> 49:45.578
# Save my soul
from Purgatory #

49:58.695 --> 49:59.787
Pie.

50:02.599 --> 50:04.430
Murder God.

50:04.468 --> 50:06.766
That's what it really says.

50:12.109 --> 50:15.943
Pie, I'm sorry
he killed you.

50:15.979 --> 50:17.810
Never mind.

50:17.848 --> 50:19.611
I have something for you.

50:21.785 --> 50:23.013
Tak ah lah!

50:23.053 --> 50:25.453
Tak!

50:29.793 --> 50:31.522
Look, David.

50:46.977 --> 50:48.535
David, are you OK?

50:51.715 --> 50:53.512
Could you
please turn around?

50:53.550 --> 50:54.983
This is a little
embarrassing.

50:57.854 --> 50:59.822
David, whatever
you have in mind...

50:59.856 --> 51:02.051
It can't be a good idea.

51:02.092 --> 51:03.081
It's the only idea.

51:03.126 --> 51:04.423
Who says so, son?

51:04.461 --> 51:06.622
My sister...

51:06.663 --> 51:07.652
God.

51:11.835 --> 51:12.859
Are you going to stop this...

51:12.903 --> 51:15.701
before you son does
something he regrets?

51:15.739 --> 51:17.036
David, you don't
have to do this.

51:17.074 --> 51:19.474
The cop's bleeding out.
He can't last much longer.

51:19.509 --> 51:20.908
It won't take him long...

51:20.944 --> 51:23.344
to kill my mom
if decides to.

51:23.380 --> 51:26.543
David, I don't know
what you're planning...

51:26.583 --> 51:28.210
But I forbid it.

51:28.251 --> 51:29.377
Sorry, Dad.

51:32.923 --> 51:33.912
What's he doing?

51:45.402 --> 51:48.098
David! David,
you don't have to do this.

51:48.138 --> 51:49.730
You'll get stuck.

51:52.075 --> 51:53.269
Even if you do get out,

51:53.310 --> 51:55.039
That thing'll eat you
from the feet up.

51:55.078 --> 51:58.241
Lord, close its mouth
like you did with the lions...

51:58.281 --> 52:00.841
When Daniel was cast
into their den.

52:02.652 --> 52:04.085
Amen.

52:06.556 --> 52:08.387
Stop it!

52:08.425 --> 52:10.723
Get away from him
you ugly bastard.

52:12.295 --> 52:13.284
Here, here. Here! Here!

52:13.330 --> 52:14.388
Hey! Hey, come on!

52:14.431 --> 52:15.557
Get over here,
you mutt.

52:19.136 --> 52:20.728
Come to me!
Come to me!

52:23.440 --> 52:25.203
Come on,
take another bite!

52:28.111 --> 52:29.373
Come this way!
Come to me!

52:37.621 --> 52:39.714
David, there's no time!
Come on, move!

52:40.857 --> 52:42.757
Get out of there, David!

52:42.792 --> 52:45.260
David, pull it!
Get out of there!

52:48.198 --> 52:49.756
Come on, come on!

52:52.936 --> 52:54.927
David, push!

52:59.676 --> 53:01.007
Get out!
Get out!

53:03.380 --> 53:04.938
Call the police!

53:04.981 --> 53:07.677
Run, run, David!

53:27.037 --> 53:29.232
Please help me
take care of my mom...

53:29.272 --> 53:31.604
and do what
I'm supposed to do.

54:23.560 --> 54:25.460
Hello?

54:26.663 --> 54:28.358
Anybody home?

54:37.240 --> 54:38.468
Tasteful.

54:38.508 --> 54:41.170
Operators are standing by.

54:41.211 --> 54:43.008
Hello?! Anybody there?

54:43.046 --> 54:44.707
It's dead!

54:44.748 --> 54:45.715
It's got to be the...

54:46.783 --> 54:48.080
Hey, wait! Wait! Wait!

54:48.118 --> 54:49.483
Wait.

54:49.519 --> 54:53.216
There are some garbage cans
lined up against the wall.

54:53.256 --> 54:54.951
The wind just knocked
one down. That's all.

54:54.991 --> 54:56.356
I don't care.
I want to get out of here.

54:56.393 --> 54:58.827
This place is empty,
and it gives me the creeps.

54:58.862 --> 55:01.126
There's trucks out there.

55:01.164 --> 55:03.098
Where is everybody?

55:03.133 --> 55:04.532
I don't know.
But I just think...

55:04.567 --> 55:05.898
we ought to just keep...

55:05.935 --> 55:06.993
I know, just tell me...

55:07.037 --> 55:08.368
we're going to be
laughing at each other...

55:08.405 --> 55:10.339
and feeling stupid
in a few seconds. OK?

55:10.373 --> 55:13.001
OK. A few seconds.

55:13.043 --> 55:14.874
Good enough.

55:14.911 --> 55:17.141
Let's see what we see.

55:18.815 --> 55:21.215
Do you hear that?

55:21.251 --> 55:23.776
Sounds like a kid blowing
bubbles through a straw.

55:25.488 --> 55:27.479
Do not worry, Little Nell,

55:27.524 --> 55:29.651
for I shall save you.

55:30.660 --> 55:31.854
Dork.

55:31.895 --> 55:33.829
Yeah.

55:45.375 --> 55:47.240
It's just an aquarium.

55:53.550 --> 55:54.710
No, look.

55:56.152 --> 55:57.414
Look.

55:57.454 --> 55:58.614
What?

56:01.891 --> 56:03.483
Behind the boat.

56:09.494 --> 56:11.086
It's a hand.

56:12.864 --> 56:15.196
My God, what happened here?

56:28.280 --> 56:30.248
I love you, Pie.

57:59.571 --> 58:02.005
Please help me not to freak.

01:00:15.573 --> 01:00:17.165
Oh! Oh, God!

01:00:17.208 --> 01:00:19.176
- Oh!
- Oh, God.

01:00:21.379 --> 01:00:24.177
Whatever
happened here is over.

01:00:24.215 --> 01:00:25.876
It's over. It's over.

01:00:26.985 --> 01:00:28.646
Oh, God.

01:00:28.686 --> 01:00:31.655
OK. All right. OK.

01:00:37.328 --> 01:00:38.886
The blood's dry.

01:00:38.930 --> 01:00:40.921
It's... it's gone brown.

01:00:40.965 --> 01:00:43.490
It's gone brown.

01:00:43.535 --> 01:00:45.730
OK. It's all right.

01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:48.432
It's all right.
It's all right.

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:37.511
I wanna get out of here.

01:01:41.593 --> 01:01:44.858
Yeah.
Yeah, we better...

01:02:01.079 --> 01:02:02.205
What's the matter
with you?

01:02:02.247 --> 01:02:05.182
You think this is
Anthropology 101?

01:02:12.323 --> 01:02:13.984
What is it?

01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:40.310
What the...

01:02:40.351 --> 01:02:41.318
What...

01:02:41.352 --> 01:02:43.684
I don't know.

01:02:46.157 --> 01:02:48.421
Whatever.

01:02:57.001 --> 01:02:58.468
Wait!

01:03:00.939 --> 01:03:02.907
I think I just...

01:03:05.877 --> 01:03:06.901
What?

01:03:08.646 --> 01:03:09.806
Never mind.

01:03:12.917 --> 01:03:14.316
Look at its tongue.

01:03:16.154 --> 01:03:20.591
Do you think that
that did all of this?

01:03:20.625 --> 01:03:21.853
I don't know
and I don't care.

01:03:21.893 --> 01:03:23.360
I just wanna
get out of here.

01:03:23.394 --> 01:03:24.554
Come on.

01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:27.129
No way!

01:03:54.392 --> 01:03:56.189
David, son.

01:03:56.227 --> 01:03:58.991
If that's you,
don't come in!

01:03:59.030 --> 01:04:00.759
That thing's right
in front of the door!

01:04:00.798 --> 01:04:02.095
How close?

01:04:02.133 --> 01:04:03.566
About five feet.

01:04:03.601 --> 01:04:06.764
And looking right at
the sound of your voice.

01:04:06.804 --> 01:04:08.567
I have a gun.

01:04:08.606 --> 01:04:09.800
I'm gonna shoot it.

01:04:09.841 --> 01:04:10.808
No, don't even
think about it!

01:04:11.909 --> 01:04:13.968
I think you all better
get under your bunks.

01:04:14.012 --> 01:04:16.378
Have you ever shot
a gun before, kid?

01:04:16.414 --> 01:04:18.382
Not a real one.

01:04:18.416 --> 01:04:20.441
Oh, Jesus wept.

01:04:20.485 --> 01:04:21.975
You don't even
know if it's loaded!

01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:24.147
Or if it has a safety!

01:04:31.963 --> 01:04:33.726
I have to do this.

01:04:33.765 --> 01:04:35.926
I tried the phones.

01:04:35.967 --> 01:04:37.491
They're dead.

01:04:37.535 --> 01:04:39.162
David, count to five,
so we'll know.

01:04:39.203 --> 01:04:40.500
Hey, you're gonna
get my son killed!

01:04:40.538 --> 01:04:41.505
What the hell's
the difference?

01:04:41.539 --> 01:04:42.733
If big daddy
comes back here...

01:04:42.774 --> 01:04:43.763
we're all dead.

01:04:45.977 --> 01:04:47.444
Dad, get down!

01:04:47.478 --> 01:04:49.446
- Please.
- OK, David.

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:50.447
One!

01:04:52.984 --> 01:04:55.452
Is my dad under cover?

01:04:55.486 --> 01:04:57.613
Yeah.

01:04:57.655 --> 01:04:59.850
- Be careful, son!
- And shoot up!

01:04:59.891 --> 01:05:01.290
Remember,
he's gonna jump!

01:05:01.325 --> 01:05:03.486
OK.

01:05:03.528 --> 01:05:04.517
Two!

01:05:06.464 --> 01:05:08.022
Three!

01:05:10.401 --> 01:05:11.732
Four.

01:05:13.204 --> 01:05:14.171
Five!

01:05:17.408 --> 01:05:18.807
David!

01:05:18.843 --> 01:05:20.936
David!

01:05:20.978 --> 01:05:22.809
You OK, son?

01:05:22.847 --> 01:05:24.337
Please, David.

01:05:24.382 --> 01:05:26.612
Answer me!

01:05:28.653 --> 01:05:30.883
David...

01:05:32.523 --> 01:05:33.490
David...

01:05:33.524 --> 01:05:36.516
David...

01:06:09.894 --> 01:06:12.761
It... twitched.

01:06:12.797 --> 01:06:15.459
It was horrible.

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.798
You did a good job, pal.

01:06:17.835 --> 01:06:19.234
An amazing job.

01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:21.135
Yeah, it was, David.

01:06:21.172 --> 01:06:23.402
Would you check
for a key here and let us out?

01:06:23.441 --> 01:06:24.738
Maybe in the desk?

01:06:31.983 --> 01:06:33.610
Look in there.

01:06:48.766 --> 01:06:51.860
I'm so proud of you.

01:06:54.305 --> 01:06:56.500
Seeing Pie was the hardest.

01:06:56.541 --> 01:06:59.635
I covered her
with a jacket.

01:07:04.582 --> 01:07:06.140
You did the best
you could, my boy.

01:07:06.184 --> 01:07:07.845
You did the best
you could.

01:07:10.221 --> 01:07:12.746
I'm scared for mom.

01:07:12.790 --> 01:07:14.417
Look, I don't
mean to rush you...

01:07:14.458 --> 01:07:16.323
But the sooner we
get out of here...

01:07:32.176 --> 01:07:33.803
Where is everybody?

01:07:36.581 --> 01:07:37.843
Look! Look! Look!

01:07:37.882 --> 01:07:39.315
Lights.

01:07:39.350 --> 01:07:42.945
Where there's lights,
there's phones.

01:07:44.422 --> 01:07:46.481
What was that?

01:07:52.830 --> 01:07:53.956
You wait here.

01:07:53.998 --> 01:07:55.590
Yeah, right!

01:07:55.633 --> 01:07:57.658
Eat me, said
the cake to Alice.

01:08:21.792 --> 01:08:23.657
It's hot in here.

01:08:23.694 --> 01:08:26.162
The air conditioning's off.

01:08:26.197 --> 01:08:28.096
It smells funny.

01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:30.460
Hey...

01:08:43.848 --> 01:08:45.042
Now, look, forget this.

01:08:45.082 --> 01:08:47.175
Forget this, please.

01:08:47.218 --> 01:08:49.812
We came here to find
people, all right?

01:08:49.854 --> 01:08:50.877
So let's find 'em.

01:08:50.921 --> 01:08:53.082
OK.
OK.

01:08:55.359 --> 01:08:57.259
Let's go.

01:08:57.295 --> 01:08:58.761
Hello?

01:09:03.234 --> 01:09:04.633
Anybody here?

01:09:09.006 --> 01:09:10.200
Hello?

01:09:10.241 --> 01:09:12.607
Hey. Hey, Steve,
there's somebody there.

01:09:12.643 --> 01:09:14.941
No, no, no.

01:09:14.979 --> 01:09:16.810
She's... dead.

01:09:16.846 --> 01:09:18.041
No, she's not.
I can see her head moving.

01:09:18.082 --> 01:09:19.071
No, Cynthia...

01:09:19.116 --> 01:09:20.549
- Hey, ma'am?
- No! It's... Don't!

01:09:20.584 --> 01:09:21.608
Ma'am?

01:09:36.801 --> 01:09:37.961
Wait, wait, wait!

01:09:38.002 --> 01:09:39.560
Wait, wait.

01:09:39.603 --> 01:09:40.899
A phone. A phone.

01:09:40.938 --> 01:09:41.926
We got a phone.

01:09:57.688 --> 01:09:58.950
Go back.

01:09:58.989 --> 01:10:01.116
Boss! Oh, my God,
we thought you were dead!

01:10:01.158 --> 01:10:02.921
We found your bike
underneath this...

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:03.984
What happened to your face?

01:10:04.028 --> 01:10:05.290
Same thing that
happened to mine.

01:10:05.329 --> 01:10:06.296
The cop.

01:10:06.330 --> 01:10:07.297
The market!

01:10:07.331 --> 01:10:09.561
It's full of...
things!

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:11.192
It's not just
the market!

01:10:11.235 --> 01:10:12.634
Never mind that.
We got wheels.

01:10:12.670 --> 01:10:13.637
Let's get the hell
out of here. Come on!

01:10:14.672 --> 01:10:15.639
Somebody's coming!

01:10:15.673 --> 01:10:16.799
It's Collie!

01:10:16.841 --> 01:10:18.308
He's coming back!

01:10:18.342 --> 01:10:19.832
We gotta get
out of here!

01:10:19.877 --> 01:10:20.901
Come on, let's go!

01:10:20.945 --> 01:10:22.139
We gotta get that truck
off the street, too!

01:10:22.179 --> 01:10:23.840
What? Make a run
for the highway?

01:10:23.881 --> 01:10:25.314
Son, we'd never make it!

01:10:25.349 --> 01:10:26.646
All right. Come on,
let's go! Hurry up!

01:10:26.684 --> 01:10:28.242
Take them round the back!

01:10:28.285 --> 01:10:30.014
Hey, you know
where we're going?

01:10:30.054 --> 01:10:31.043
Yeah.

01:10:31.088 --> 01:10:32.180
All right,
you're coming with me.

01:10:32.223 --> 01:10:33.986
Let's go.
You got it?

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:45.053
That damn little prayboy.

01:12:01.912 --> 01:12:03.243
Where are they?

01:12:05.216 --> 01:12:06.740
Show me.

01:12:36.981 --> 01:12:38.676
Hey!

01:12:39.683 --> 01:12:41.651
It's just a rope.
You're OK.

01:12:41.685 --> 01:12:43.448
I hate narrow places.

01:12:44.788 --> 01:12:46.653
It'll get better soon.

01:12:46.690 --> 01:12:48.885
Gather around.

01:12:48.926 --> 01:12:50.723
I want you all
to have the full effect.

01:12:53.998 --> 01:12:55.625
Come on over here.
Watch your step, though.

01:12:55.666 --> 01:12:57.099
Wow, this is amazing.

01:13:00.471 --> 01:13:03.998
Theater's been closed
over twenty years now.

01:13:04.041 --> 01:13:05.702
Few of us got tired
of the hoorah...

01:13:05.743 --> 01:13:07.643
down at the Owls' Club
and bought it.

01:13:09.713 --> 01:13:11.146
Hey, Steve.
Watch.

01:13:11.181 --> 01:13:13.706
No, no, no, no, no, no,

01:13:13.751 --> 01:13:15.878
Old-timer. Maybe later.

01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:17.615
Here. Check this out.

01:13:17.655 --> 01:13:18.883
Who the hell
are you to tell me...

01:13:18.923 --> 01:13:20.982
I can't have a drink out
of my own liquor cabinet?

01:13:21.025 --> 01:13:22.083
Somebody who knows
what you are.

01:13:22.126 --> 01:13:23.718
Somebody
who's been there.

01:13:23.761 --> 01:13:26.525
And while that crazy cop
is still out there somewhere...

01:13:26.564 --> 01:13:28.657
That is off-limits...

01:13:28.699 --> 01:13:29.666
You got that?

01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:31.531
Fine.

01:13:33.037 --> 01:13:34.698
Well, what about
these lights?

01:13:34.738 --> 01:13:37.206
The cop gonna
see 'em out there?

01:13:37.241 --> 01:13:39.903
The theater's boarded up,
your majesty.

01:13:39.944 --> 01:13:41.912
No light
shines through.

01:13:41.946 --> 01:13:43.914
We're as safe here
as anywhere.

01:13:43.948 --> 01:13:46.109
I reckon.

01:14:17.581 --> 01:14:19.640
The cop'll find
us sooner or later.

01:14:19.683 --> 01:14:21.651
- You know he will.
- You saw him.

01:14:21.685 --> 01:14:23.949
Time is not
on his side.

01:14:23.988 --> 01:14:25.546
Where's... where's
everybody else?

01:14:25.589 --> 01:14:27.022
Dead.

01:14:27.057 --> 01:14:28.718
He killed 'em.

01:14:28.759 --> 01:14:30.351
Yeah, some of 'em, I'm sure.

01:14:30.394 --> 01:14:31.361
But where are
the rest of 'em?

01:14:31.395 --> 01:14:32.384
You're not hearing me.

01:14:32.429 --> 01:14:35.193
Anything that got into his road...

01:14:35.232 --> 01:14:36.563
he killed it.

01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:38.431
Oh, that's nuts.

01:14:38.469 --> 01:14:40.630
He couldn't have killed 'em all.

01:14:40.671 --> 01:14:42.229
Well, look around,
smart aleck.

01:14:43.941 --> 01:14:46.273
How come
he didn't kill you?

01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:48.244
I don't know.

01:14:48.278 --> 01:14:50.644
He come for me
a couple of days ago.

01:14:50.681 --> 01:14:56.142
I had been on a ranch job...

01:14:56.186 --> 01:14:57.915
and I slept a little bit late.

01:14:59.223 --> 01:15:01.657
Slept in my coat, actually.

01:15:01.692 --> 01:15:05.150
I might...
had too much to drink, too.

01:15:06.497 --> 01:15:08.488
Now, he came right
into my bedroom.

01:15:08.532 --> 01:15:10.557
First I knew...

01:15:10.601 --> 01:15:13.297
Collie Entragian
was dragging me out of bed...

01:15:13.337 --> 01:15:15.771
and snapping
his damn handcuffs...

01:15:15.806 --> 01:15:18.775
and dragging me off to jail.

01:15:18.809 --> 01:15:22.142
He pulled me all the way
through the house...

01:15:22.179 --> 01:15:25.307
and across the yard,
and into his car.

01:15:25.349 --> 01:15:26.976
Locked me in the back
of the cruiser...

01:15:27.017 --> 01:15:29.918
and hauled my ass
off to jail.

01:15:29.953 --> 01:15:31.750
He was talkin' all kinds
of crazy stuff...

01:15:31.789 --> 01:15:33.017
in some other language.

01:15:34.758 --> 01:15:37.283
And they weren't all dead...

01:15:37.327 --> 01:15:38.760
Then, you know...

01:15:38.796 --> 01:15:41.424
the folks in town, I mean.

01:15:41.465 --> 01:15:45.333
He got half a dozen on
the way back from my place.

01:15:45.369 --> 01:15:47.667
Shot them down
in the streets, ran over them.

01:15:49.673 --> 01:15:51.163
The waitress...

01:15:51.208 --> 01:15:54.609
in the Desert Rose
was screaming...

01:15:54.645 --> 01:15:56.169
looking over his shoulder...

01:15:56.213 --> 01:15:58.113
and she tripped.

01:15:59.616 --> 01:16:02.881
That thump when
we went over her...

01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:05.514
and him... Laughing.

01:16:07.324 --> 01:16:10.122
That little bear
on the dashboard...

01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:12.151
nodding his head
up and down.

01:16:12.196 --> 01:16:14.630
And him...

01:16:16.233 --> 01:16:17.860
laughing.

01:16:19.403 --> 01:16:21.530
Some people must
have escaped.

01:16:21.572 --> 01:16:22.903
He's not human.

01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:25.431
I know that
sounds crazy, but...

01:16:25.476 --> 01:16:26.704
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

01:16:29.012 --> 01:16:32.175
They reopened a mine,
the old China Pit.

01:16:33.584 --> 01:16:35.142
Whatever's
happening here...

01:16:35.185 --> 01:16:38.416
I think it came
from over there.

01:16:38.455 --> 01:16:40.719
What are you,
the town historian?

01:16:40.758 --> 01:16:43.886
I guess...
Guess you might say so.

01:16:45.462 --> 01:16:46.861
In an unofficial way.

01:16:46.897 --> 01:16:49.331
I like history.

01:16:49.366 --> 01:16:51.095
Local history, especially.

01:16:51.135 --> 01:16:53.569
Up until now, that is.

01:16:54.938 --> 01:16:56.565
I found some stuff to eat.

01:16:56.607 --> 01:16:58.165
Well, this
should certainly...

01:16:58.208 --> 01:17:00.574
Take care of
hunger in America.

01:17:00.611 --> 01:17:02.738
It's sardines.

01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:04.145
Not great, I guess.

01:17:04.181 --> 01:17:05.375
Bet this boy and I'd settle...

01:17:05.415 --> 01:17:06.712
for woodchuck pâté.

01:17:06.750 --> 01:17:08.183
Pass it around, David.

01:17:09.286 --> 01:17:12.278
Would anybody mind if
I said a prayer first?

01:17:12.322 --> 01:17:14.483
Sort of like a Grace?

01:17:14.525 --> 01:17:16.618
Go for it, Davey boy.

01:17:20.564 --> 01:17:22.930
God bless this food
we're about to eat.

01:17:22.966 --> 01:17:25.526
Bless our fellowship.

01:17:25.569 --> 01:17:27.400
Take care of us.

01:17:27.437 --> 01:17:29.234
Deliver us from evil.

01:17:29.273 --> 01:17:31.571
Especially my mom.

01:17:33.143 --> 01:17:34.940
Please let her be OK.

01:17:35.946 --> 01:17:38.176
Please.

01:17:38.215 --> 01:17:39.239
Amen.

01:17:39.283 --> 01:17:40.614
Amen.

01:17:42.186 --> 01:17:44.120
You really believe
this, don't you?

01:17:46.256 --> 01:17:47.621
Don't you?

01:17:51.395 --> 01:17:53.659
Well, there's enough
for everyone.

01:17:53.697 --> 01:17:54.857
Honest.

01:18:18.155 --> 01:18:20.623
Appears he's right, ma'am.

01:18:47.050 --> 01:18:50.042
We were headed to Tahoe...

01:18:50.087 --> 01:18:52.021
when all the tires
went flat.

01:18:53.790 --> 01:18:55.382
And then
he pulled up behind us...

01:18:55.425 --> 01:18:58.394
and gave us
some story about...

01:18:58.428 --> 01:18:59.759
a crazy in the desert...

01:18:59.796 --> 01:19:02.629
who was disabling vehicles, and...

01:19:04.701 --> 01:19:06.066
and shooting folks.

01:19:09.539 --> 01:19:11.769
And... and then
he looked at Pie.

01:19:14.378 --> 01:19:17.176
When he smiled at her...

01:19:17.214 --> 01:19:18.977
Your...

01:19:20.183 --> 01:19:21.582
Your daughter
dropped her doll.

01:19:24.288 --> 01:19:25.812
Ellen couldn't
stop her from crying...

01:19:25.856 --> 01:19:26.982
But...

01:19:27.991 --> 01:19:30.084
David made her feel better.

01:19:30.127 --> 01:19:32.095
He always could.

01:19:32.129 --> 01:19:33.528
So how do we
get out of this?

01:19:33.563 --> 01:19:34.587
I mean, do we just...

01:19:34.631 --> 01:19:36.428
wait for the wind
to die down, or what?

01:19:36.466 --> 01:19:38.696
Waiting's a bad idea.

01:19:38.735 --> 01:19:40.327
Why do you say that?

01:19:40.370 --> 01:19:42.361
Well, because...

01:19:42.406 --> 01:19:43.430
somebody should've
gotten out of here...

01:19:43.473 --> 01:19:44.565
and nobody did.

01:19:44.608 --> 01:19:46.735
There's something...

01:19:46.777 --> 01:19:49.803
Loose here...

01:19:49.846 --> 01:19:51.040
and if we hang around...

01:19:51.081 --> 01:19:53.015
I think it's... its
apt to eat us alive.

01:19:53.050 --> 01:19:54.711
I'm not going anywhere
until I find out...

01:19:54.751 --> 01:19:55.877
what happened
to my mom!

01:19:55.919 --> 01:19:56.908
- No, David, no.
- No!

01:19:56.954 --> 01:19:58.683
It won't do
your mom any good...

01:19:58.722 --> 01:20:00.019
for you
and the rest of us...

01:20:00.057 --> 01:20:01.456
to die trying to find her.

01:20:01.491 --> 01:20:02.480
It's true, son.

01:20:02.526 --> 01:20:04.221
It's a crock!
That's what it is!

01:20:04.261 --> 01:20:06.252
None of you care
about my mother.

01:20:07.965 --> 01:20:09.592
Not even you, Dad.

01:20:09.633 --> 01:20:11.464
You know that's not true.

01:20:11.501 --> 01:20:13.765
If we leave, it'll be
too late to save her.

01:20:15.138 --> 01:20:16.435
I know that just like...

01:20:16.473 --> 01:20:17.497
I knew how
to use the soap...

01:20:17.541 --> 01:20:19.441
To get us out
of the cell.

01:20:21.178 --> 01:20:22.509
Why don't
you pray?

01:20:22.546 --> 01:20:24.138
I can't.

01:20:24.181 --> 01:20:25.478
Right now,
I'm too pissed.

01:20:25.515 --> 01:20:26.573
At God?

01:20:26.616 --> 01:20:28.106
At Santa Claus.

01:20:37.461 --> 01:20:39.486
Is that really how
it was, Mr. Billingsley?

01:20:39.529 --> 01:20:41.622
All those white miners...

01:20:41.665 --> 01:20:43.292
and Chinese miners
working together?

01:20:44.768 --> 01:20:45.894
Pretty much, I guess.

01:20:45.936 --> 01:20:47.426
Oh, come on.
They didn't call it...

01:20:47.471 --> 01:20:48.836
The Chinese-American pit, did they?

01:20:48.872 --> 01:20:50.567
Why don't you
tell us about it?

01:20:50.607 --> 01:20:52.199
You think
you know it all...

01:20:52.242 --> 01:20:53.675
Mr. High and mighty!

01:20:53.710 --> 01:20:54.938
Why don't you tell it?

01:20:54.978 --> 01:20:56.775
You're the big
storyteller.

01:20:56.813 --> 01:20:57.973
I'll tell you about Vietnam.

01:20:58.015 --> 01:20:59.482
You tell us
about desperation.

01:20:59.516 --> 01:21:00.744
Talk about it.

01:21:04.221 --> 01:21:07.247
Every... town has a sister.

01:21:08.825 --> 01:21:10.986
And every town
has its secrets.

01:21:12.396 --> 01:21:14.330
We're here. We want
to know about it.

01:21:14.364 --> 01:21:15.956
Tell us about it.

01:21:15.999 --> 01:21:18.126
Well, you'll all
think I'm crazy.

01:21:18.168 --> 01:21:19.829
After what we've seen?

01:21:19.870 --> 01:21:21.428
Anybody think Tom's crazy...

01:21:21.471 --> 01:21:22.495
raise their hands.

01:21:29.679 --> 01:21:32.079
Well, about a month ago...

01:21:32.115 --> 01:21:33.377
An A.N.F.O. crew uncovered...

01:21:33.417 --> 01:21:35.282
the old Rattlesnake Shaft...

01:21:35.318 --> 01:21:38.446
while they were
shooting blast holes.

01:21:38.488 --> 01:21:40.752
They dug the Rattlesnake...

01:21:40.791 --> 01:21:43.624
a good 150 years ago.

01:21:45.062 --> 01:21:47.223
It caved in
about three months later...

01:21:47.264 --> 01:21:49.596
And the miners...

01:21:49.633 --> 01:21:51.294
All but two of the Chinese...

01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:55.033
were buried alive...

01:21:55.072 --> 01:21:57.666
along with
whatever they dug up...

01:21:57.707 --> 01:22:01.199
when they started working
the mine again last month.

01:22:02.979 --> 01:22:04.571
Whatever they woke up.

01:22:05.715 --> 01:22:08.013
I think it's...

01:22:08.051 --> 01:22:09.643
a waisin.

01:22:09.686 --> 01:22:11.916
An earth demon.

01:22:13.523 --> 01:22:15.821
Now that the shafts
are open again...

01:22:15.859 --> 01:22:18.259
All of those animals
we're seeing...

01:22:18.295 --> 01:22:19.887
I think...

01:22:19.930 --> 01:22:23.491
They're its eyes and ears.

01:22:25.368 --> 01:22:27.598
Now, the Chinese
were treated badly...

01:22:27.637 --> 01:22:29.969
in California,
but here in Nevada...

01:22:30.006 --> 01:22:32.201
they were damn near
part of the community.

01:22:32.242 --> 01:22:34.972
They were working to support
their families back home...

01:22:35.011 --> 01:22:37.104
and to buy land
of their own.

01:22:37.147 --> 01:22:40.139
Nobody forced them
down into the mines.

01:22:40.183 --> 01:22:41.343
What about
the two survivors?

01:22:41.384 --> 01:22:42.442
How'd they get out?

01:22:42.486 --> 01:22:44.420
Well, they just
beat the cave-in.

01:22:44.454 --> 01:22:45.614
Pure luck.

01:22:47.691 --> 01:22:49.852
Then they left town, I guess.

01:22:49.893 --> 01:22:52.623
And nobody tried to pin
the cave-in on them?

01:22:52.662 --> 01:22:54.289
Now, why would they
try to do that?

01:22:54.331 --> 01:22:56.026
Well, from my experience...

01:22:56.066 --> 01:22:58.159
The best scapegoats
are those...

01:22:58.201 --> 01:22:59.566
who can't
speak English.

01:22:59.603 --> 01:23:03.130
You know, that's all
ancient history.

01:23:03.173 --> 01:23:05.698
But they've been finding
some damn strange stuff...

01:23:05.742 --> 01:23:07.539
down in that hole...

01:23:07.577 --> 01:23:09.738
in the last couple of weeks.

01:23:09.779 --> 01:23:11.440
Carvings and such.

01:23:12.582 --> 01:23:13.549
I think...

01:23:13.583 --> 01:23:16.916
something came
out of that mine.

01:23:16.953 --> 01:23:18.477
Something that...

01:23:18.522 --> 01:23:19.955
never died.

01:23:21.291 --> 01:23:23.020
And never will.

01:23:24.828 --> 01:23:25.988
Now, I know
how that sounds...

01:23:26.029 --> 01:23:28.725
but you asked for it.

01:23:32.569 --> 01:23:34.935
I...

01:23:34.971 --> 01:23:37.030
I have
to take a leak.

01:23:38.041 --> 01:23:39.474
I'll be back
in a minute.

01:23:39.509 --> 01:23:40.476
Take this with you.

01:23:40.510 --> 01:23:42.000
Thank you.

01:23:48.552 --> 01:23:50.110
If you know he's
got a bottle stashed...

01:23:50.153 --> 01:23:52.121
In the boy's room,
why didn't you stop him?

01:23:52.155 --> 01:23:53.679
Because I think
he needs a drink...

01:23:53.723 --> 01:23:54.849
to steady himself...

01:23:54.891 --> 01:23:57.086
and one's all he's
gonna take, for now.

01:23:57.127 --> 01:24:00.290
Did you used to drink,
Mr. Marinville?

01:24:01.431 --> 01:24:04.525
No, David,
I used to drown.

01:24:06.136 --> 01:24:07.694
It was a way
of putting out...

01:24:07.737 --> 01:24:10.706
the dreams after the war.

01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:11.707
David?

01:24:11.741 --> 01:24:14.301
This god of yours
performed a miracle...

01:24:14.344 --> 01:24:16.175
on your friend, right?

01:24:16.213 --> 01:24:17.703
Yes.

01:24:17.747 --> 01:24:19.374
Have you stopped
to ask yourself...

01:24:19.416 --> 01:24:21.611
why god would want
to hurt a child...

01:24:21.651 --> 01:24:22.709
to say hello?

01:24:22.752 --> 01:24:24.743
I asked Reverend Martin
about that.

01:24:26.056 --> 01:24:28.183
and I asked him how
to keep my promise.

01:24:29.626 --> 01:24:31.218
What promise is that?

01:24:31.261 --> 01:24:34.662
That if God saved Bryan,
I'd do something he wanted.

01:24:34.698 --> 01:24:37.792
Anything he wanted, really.

01:24:37.834 --> 01:24:39.927
And this is it?

01:24:39.970 --> 01:24:41.198
That something?

01:24:41.238 --> 01:24:43.001
You think this
is for the best?

01:24:43.039 --> 01:24:44.734
That God is good and
this is for the best?

01:24:44.774 --> 01:24:46.901
I don't know anymore.

01:24:48.578 --> 01:24:50.341
It's so much harder now.

01:24:51.781 --> 01:24:52.805
Reverend Martin says...

01:24:52.849 --> 01:24:56.080
that faith isn't
just believing in God.

01:24:56.119 --> 01:24:58.610
Believing God is sane.

01:24:59.923 --> 01:25:01.891
I think I understood that.

01:25:03.526 --> 01:25:05.153
But he killed my sister!

01:25:05.195 --> 01:25:07.220
He took my mom!

01:25:10.467 --> 01:25:12.059
We have to get
out of here, David.

01:25:12.102 --> 01:25:14.195
That's what
I have faith in.

01:25:14.237 --> 01:25:16.034
We have to.

01:25:54.377 --> 01:25:55.344
What was that?

01:25:55.378 --> 01:25:57.073
My, God!
It's the old man!

01:25:57.113 --> 01:25:58.774
David!

01:26:03.887 --> 01:26:05.912
Pie...

01:26:07.557 --> 01:26:09.047
Pie, wait up!

01:26:14.731 --> 01:26:16.392
Oh! Oh, my God!

01:26:17.567 --> 01:26:18.556
Shoot it, Steve!
Blow its head off!

01:26:18.601 --> 01:26:20.694
I don't want
to hit the old man!

01:26:21.805 --> 01:26:23.397
Then blow its ass off!
It's killing him!

01:27:27.237 --> 01:27:29.068
John Ford said...

01:27:29.105 --> 01:27:32.006
"If you have a choice
between truth or legend...

01:27:32.041 --> 01:27:33.065
print the legend."

01:27:34.110 --> 01:27:36.635
Come on!
There's not much time.

01:27:45.121 --> 01:27:46.520
Hey!

01:27:46.556 --> 01:27:48.285
Come on!

01:27:48.324 --> 01:27:49.291
Somebody get it!

01:27:49.325 --> 01:27:50.451
Shoot it!

01:27:50.493 --> 01:27:53.326
Kill it! I...
I can't get it!

01:27:53.363 --> 01:27:55.024
Somebody
shoot this thing!

01:27:55.064 --> 01:27:56.258
Get it off me!

01:28:00.904 --> 01:28:03.805
- Shoot him, Johnny!
- Don't hurt Steve!

01:28:06.009 --> 01:28:08.477
Somebody shoot
the damn thing!

01:28:25.528 --> 01:28:27.359
Thanks, boss.

01:28:38.908 --> 01:28:41.240
Where's David?
Where's my boy?

01:28:41.277 --> 01:28:42.471
David?

01:28:42.512 --> 01:28:43.979
David!

01:28:44.013 --> 01:28:46.140
You, go find David.
I'll stay with him.

01:28:53.289 --> 01:28:54.654
David!

01:28:54.691 --> 01:28:56.659
David! Where are you?!

01:29:00.129 --> 01:29:02.324
What if the cop's got him?

01:29:09.806 --> 01:29:12.274
Why are you here?

01:29:12.308 --> 01:29:15.106
For the same reason
everyone's here.

01:29:15.144 --> 01:29:17.112
To love God and serve God.

01:29:17.146 --> 01:29:19.740
What am I
supposed to do?

01:29:19.782 --> 01:29:22.580
Look, David. See.

01:33:58.194 --> 01:33:59.593
David?

01:34:01.531 --> 01:34:03.863
David?

01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:05.265
He's in there.

01:34:19.282 --> 01:34:21.273
Oh, s-s-scared.

01:34:21.317 --> 01:34:24.480
Oh, gosh.

01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:26.988
Tom.

01:34:27.023 --> 01:34:28.354
It's OK.

01:34:47.677 --> 01:34:50.737
Please,
somebody help me.

01:35:01.057 --> 01:35:02.581
Ellen, is that you?

01:35:02.625 --> 01:35:04.388
Who else would it be?

01:35:19.709 --> 01:35:22.735
Trouble with these bodies
is how fast they wear out...

01:35:22.778 --> 01:35:25.474
but you should last a while.

01:35:41.864 --> 01:35:43.422
Come on, David.

01:35:44.567 --> 01:35:47.593
Come on back.

01:35:47.637 --> 01:35:49.161
Tom is dead.

01:35:49.205 --> 01:35:51.400
Mary's gone.

01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:53.374
You think
it was the cop?

01:35:53.409 --> 01:35:54.899
Course it was.

01:35:54.944 --> 01:35:57.572
I just don't know why
he didn't trash us.

01:35:57.613 --> 01:35:59.808
He's afraid of us.

01:36:01.250 --> 01:36:03.946
And there is no "he."

01:36:03.986 --> 01:36:07.080
It's a thing
from the mine.

01:36:07.123 --> 01:36:09.683
Collie Entragian
is dead.

01:36:09.725 --> 01:36:11.522
So is my mother.

01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:14.324
David, honey, we
can't give up hope.

01:36:14.363 --> 01:36:17.696
I have a lot to tell you.

01:36:17.733 --> 01:36:19.394
Just don't want
to do it in here.

01:36:19.435 --> 01:36:21.596
Yeah, it is
pretty creepy here,

01:36:21.637 --> 01:36:26.438
But he... it's
out there some place.

01:36:26.475 --> 01:36:28.102
No.

01:36:28.144 --> 01:36:29.736
It's in the pit.

01:36:34.483 --> 01:36:36.212
It took the head
of the assay crew...

01:36:36.252 --> 01:36:39.449
That uncovered
the Rattlesnake Shaft.

01:36:39.488 --> 01:36:42.480
His name was Cary Ripton.

01:36:42.525 --> 01:36:43.822
That's how it started.

01:36:43.859 --> 01:36:48.228
He followed a trail of
those little stone animals...

01:36:48.264 --> 01:36:51.529
The can tahs
to tak's place.

01:36:51.567 --> 01:36:53.967
That's its name...

01:36:54.003 --> 01:36:55.994
Tak.

01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:00.006
There's a hole
that goes...

01:37:01.377 --> 01:37:03.277
I think it goes into
another dimension...

01:37:03.312 --> 01:37:05.473
or something.

01:37:05.514 --> 01:37:08.176
Tak got into Cary Ripton...

01:37:08.217 --> 01:37:10.685
and from him
it jumped to the cop.

01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:13.780
It wears out bodies fast.

01:37:13.823 --> 01:37:17.259
God showed you this
on that editing machine?

01:37:18.995 --> 01:37:21.190
You dog my cats.

01:37:21.230 --> 01:37:23.130
Listen...

01:37:23.165 --> 01:37:24.826
I know you're
a famous writer.

01:37:24.867 --> 01:37:25.925
You're...

01:37:25.968 --> 01:37:28.163
used to being the center
of attention and all...

01:37:28.204 --> 01:37:29.296
but that doesn't
give you the right...

01:37:29.338 --> 01:37:30.737
to make fun of my boy.

01:37:30.773 --> 01:37:32.832
He's just afraid, Dad.

01:37:32.875 --> 01:37:34.001
That's all.

01:37:34.043 --> 01:37:36.637
That's it, I'm afraid.

01:37:38.247 --> 01:37:41.808
I'm terrified
as a matter of fact...

01:37:41.851 --> 01:37:44.183
But there is a certain
hopeful geography...

01:37:44.220 --> 01:37:45.346
about this situation.

01:37:45.388 --> 01:37:48.357
You said Tak the magnificent
is in the mine.

01:37:48.391 --> 01:37:50.188
That's south of here.

01:37:50.226 --> 01:37:51.716
The highway is north of here.

01:37:51.761 --> 01:37:54.025
The truck is right here!

01:37:54.063 --> 01:37:57.499
We get in the truck.
We fire it up.

01:37:57.533 --> 01:37:59.228
We get the hell
out of Dodge.

01:37:59.268 --> 01:38:01.168
Mary's alive.

01:38:03.039 --> 01:38:04.028
Tak's got her stored...

01:38:04.073 --> 01:38:07.804
like a spider stores
flies to eat later on.

01:38:25.561 --> 01:38:27.586
Damn it.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.433
Is anybody here?

01:38:40.609 --> 01:38:43.942
Oh, God... Please.

01:38:48.884 --> 01:38:51.614
Oh, god.
Oh, god.

01:38:51.654 --> 01:38:54.885
Oh, god.

01:38:56.358 --> 01:38:57.484
No!

01:39:02.498 --> 01:39:04.363
Oh, God!

01:39:13.609 --> 01:39:15.042
Oh, God.

01:39:23.853 --> 01:39:25.377
Oh, god!

01:39:44.473 --> 01:39:45.667
Please!

01:39:59.989 --> 01:40:01.320
Oh, my god.

01:40:07.863 --> 01:40:09.490
You gotta be joking.

01:40:09.532 --> 01:40:10.760
You seriously think...

01:40:10.799 --> 01:40:12.630
we can just drive up
to that open pit mine...

01:40:12.668 --> 01:40:14.260
and save the lady fair?

01:40:14.303 --> 01:40:16.703
We have to get out of here...

01:40:17.806 --> 01:40:20.001
You wanted
to know about God.

01:40:20.042 --> 01:40:22.067
I'll tell
you what I know.

01:40:22.111 --> 01:40:25.308
He works through people...

01:40:25.347 --> 01:40:27.611
and right now,
he's trying to work through us.

01:40:29.285 --> 01:40:31.116
I say we give it a try.

01:40:31.153 --> 01:40:32.120
Who asked you?

01:40:32.154 --> 01:40:33.416
Listen!

01:40:33.455 --> 01:40:34.786
It has to be all of us.

01:40:34.823 --> 01:40:36.757
Tak's not just
a man or a woman...

01:40:36.792 --> 01:40:38.089
No matter what
it looks like.

01:40:38.127 --> 01:40:40.095
It's a Can Tak,

01:40:40.129 --> 01:40:44.065
The big god,
the heart of the unformed.

01:40:44.099 --> 01:40:46.966
Only all of us
can stand against it.

01:40:48.237 --> 01:40:49.795
Can't you feel that?

01:40:52.641 --> 01:40:54.165
I can't feel anything.

01:40:57.213 --> 01:40:58.646
You learn a lot
of crap watching movies.

01:40:58.681 --> 01:40:59.705
You know that kid?

01:40:59.748 --> 01:41:01.340
Tak's like you.

01:41:02.551 --> 01:41:03.711
It wants us to leave.

01:41:03.752 --> 01:41:05.811
Well, then why don't
we give it what it wants?

01:41:05.854 --> 01:41:07.879
Well, there's Mary.

01:41:07.923 --> 01:41:08.981
You know, I didn't
bring her here...

01:41:09.024 --> 01:41:10.855
and I didn't take
her up to that mine...

01:41:10.893 --> 01:41:12.053
If that's where she is...

01:41:12.094 --> 01:41:13.857
So don't give me that
guilt-tripping stuff.

01:41:13.896 --> 01:41:16.592
Now you people want to fly...

01:41:16.632 --> 01:41:18.998
Trans-God airways
with the boy...

01:41:19.034 --> 01:41:20.160
Go right ahead.

01:41:20.202 --> 01:41:22.568
I think I'll pass...

01:41:22.605 --> 01:41:24.197
and not even God
can stop me.

01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:26.470
No.

01:41:26.508 --> 01:41:28.066
He gives us free will.

01:41:28.110 --> 01:41:30.408
That's right,
good old free will.

01:41:30.446 --> 01:41:32.676
God bless God, huh?

01:41:32.715 --> 01:41:37.448
I think I'll go out and find a car
with some keys in it...

01:41:37.486 --> 01:41:40.785
and resume...
my interrupted trip.

01:41:41.924 --> 01:41:43.391
You folks have a good day...

01:41:43.425 --> 01:41:45.120
and send me
a postcard...

01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:47.219
when it's time
for the reunion.

01:41:47.263 --> 01:41:48.230
You know what?

01:41:48.264 --> 01:41:49.697
I have lost
all my respect for you.

01:41:52.668 --> 01:41:54.192
I've lost the respect
of a man...

01:41:54.236 --> 01:41:56.704
Who once carried out
Steven Tyler's barf bags.

01:41:56.739 --> 01:41:58.866
Shucks.

01:42:09.618 --> 01:42:13.054
David,
tell me something.

01:42:14.757 --> 01:42:16.088
If Tak wants us to leave...

01:42:16.125 --> 01:42:18.116
why'd he bring us here
in the first place?

01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:19.593
It didn't.

01:42:19.628 --> 01:42:23.064
It thinks it did,
but it didn't.

01:42:23.098 --> 01:42:24.122
This is God's will,

01:42:24.166 --> 01:42:26.794
Not Tak's.

01:42:26.835 --> 01:42:27.859
And if you leave now...

01:42:27.903 --> 01:42:30.838
You'll smell Tak on your skin...
for the rest of your life.

01:42:38.547 --> 01:42:40.845
Well, I better go heavy
on the aftershave, huh?

01:42:42.084 --> 01:42:44.644
Hey...

01:42:44.687 --> 01:42:45.984
Anybody make it
to San Jose,

01:42:46.021 --> 01:42:48.922
I'm at the Sea Cliff.
Drinks on me.

01:42:48.957 --> 01:42:50.015
Thought you quit drinking.

01:42:50.059 --> 01:42:53.893
That was a mistake.

01:42:53.929 --> 01:42:55.658
Wish I didn't
run into this kid.

01:42:55.698 --> 01:42:56.665
Johnny!

01:42:56.699 --> 01:42:59.361
Mr. Marinville...

01:42:59.401 --> 01:43:01.266
We were put
on earth to love God...

01:43:01.303 --> 01:43:02.292
to serve him.

01:43:03.639 --> 01:43:05.402
And what else are you
doing tonight anyway?

01:43:05.441 --> 01:43:08.774
It's not... it just
isn't working, kid.

01:43:08.811 --> 01:43:10.540
It's not working.

01:43:10.579 --> 01:43:13.514
Just shut up.
Just shut up, will you?

01:43:18.487 --> 01:43:19.613
Bite me.

01:43:22.024 --> 01:43:24.686
You can't, can you?

01:43:38.073 --> 01:43:40.098
You can't hurt me, can you?

01:43:40.142 --> 01:43:43.509
Because I'm supposed
to be next.

01:44:36.398 --> 01:44:38.992
Tak ah lah.
Murder your god.

01:45:24.613 --> 01:45:27.207
So, he says to his wife,
this frog can cook...

01:45:27.249 --> 01:45:28.341
you're outta here.

01:45:37.593 --> 01:45:39.060
Are you Mr. Marinville?

01:46:00.849 --> 01:46:01.816
What the hell
are you doing?

01:46:01.850 --> 01:46:03.579
Everything blow sky high.

01:46:03.619 --> 01:46:06.645
You got five, maybe ten second,
big boy, then...

01:46:06.688 --> 01:46:08.246
boom!

01:46:08.290 --> 01:46:09.314
Tak.

01:46:09.358 --> 01:46:11.087
Tak ah lah!

01:46:14.129 --> 01:46:15.562
Tak ah lah.

01:46:24.806 --> 01:46:26.205
Ran like a rabbit.

01:46:26.241 --> 01:46:28.232
Didn't warn a soul.

01:46:28.277 --> 01:46:29.767
Fraidy boy.

01:46:29.811 --> 01:46:32.143
Tak ah lah.
Tak a wan.

01:46:56.138 --> 01:46:58.368
It was him...

01:46:58.407 --> 01:47:00.898
It...

01:47:00.943 --> 01:47:02.877
Tak.

01:47:02.911 --> 01:47:04.902
That was 35 years ago
in Saigon.

01:47:04.947 --> 01:47:05.914
Why, I don't...

01:47:05.948 --> 01:47:07.848
So, you'd know
when you saw it.

01:47:08.951 --> 01:47:11.112
When you saw it
the next time.

01:47:15.223 --> 01:47:18.056
We can still
travel, David.

01:47:18.093 --> 01:47:19.958
Drive to highway 50,
head west.

01:47:19.995 --> 01:47:21.223
Never look back.

01:47:21.263 --> 01:47:22.389
Free will, right?

01:47:22.431 --> 01:47:23.830
Yeah.

01:47:23.865 --> 01:47:25.662
Good old free will.

01:47:27.736 --> 01:47:29.567
Oh, God.

01:47:33.141 --> 01:47:35.871
Eighty-seven people died in that bar.

01:47:37.145 --> 01:47:39.010
Eighty-seven.

01:47:41.249 --> 01:47:43.740
And I never tried
to save anyone.

01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:47.111
Not a one of them.

01:47:50.492 --> 01:47:52.722
I only saved
my own sorry ass.

01:47:54.129 --> 01:47:57.496
And here?
How many in this town?

01:47:57.532 --> 01:47:59.159
Sometimes God is cruel.

01:47:59.201 --> 01:48:00.725
What good is he then?

01:48:03.538 --> 01:48:06.769
He wants us to love him...

01:48:06.808 --> 01:48:08.332
and to...

01:48:10.779 --> 01:48:12.770
Serve him?

01:48:13.782 --> 01:48:15.147
Right?

01:48:19.221 --> 01:48:20.654
Come here.

01:48:23.492 --> 01:48:24.982
Come on.

01:48:28.296 --> 01:48:29.354
You're crazy.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.400
I like that in a person.

01:48:37.072 --> 01:48:38.437
Where do we start?

01:48:38.473 --> 01:48:41.374
Mary?

01:48:41.410 --> 01:48:43.742
Let's go get her.

01:48:43.779 --> 01:48:45.872
Come on.

01:48:59.728 --> 01:49:01.719
Try the dryer, Mary.

01:51:24.406 --> 01:51:25.839
Mi him!

01:51:27.475 --> 01:51:29.306
Can de lach.

01:51:30.779 --> 01:51:33.771
Min en tow.

01:51:33.815 --> 01:51:34.804
Tak!

01:51:40.055 --> 01:51:42.455
Mi him.

01:51:42.490 --> 01:51:45.425
Can de lach.

01:52:09.951 --> 01:52:12.078
Oh, God, it's the cop.

01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:13.849
It's the cop!

01:52:20.295 --> 01:52:21.523
Come on!

01:52:21.563 --> 01:52:23.292
Wait! It's Mary!
It's Mary!

01:52:25.700 --> 01:52:28.328
It almost got me!

01:52:28.370 --> 01:52:30.031
It was so close.

01:52:30.071 --> 01:52:32.631
It was in Ellen.

01:52:32.674 --> 01:52:35.768
I'm sorry, David.

01:52:37.913 --> 01:52:41.405
I know.
It's dead.

01:52:41.449 --> 01:52:43.280
It's lying
back there dead.

01:52:43.318 --> 01:52:45.809
No, Ellen's dead,
not Tak.

01:52:49.257 --> 01:52:51.282
It's still in the mine,
isn't it?

01:52:55.697 --> 01:52:57.289
The pirin moh.

01:52:58.667 --> 01:53:01.067
That's where
it really is.

01:53:01.102 --> 01:53:03.696
Wh... what is that?

01:53:03.738 --> 01:53:06.901
The well of the worlds.

01:53:06.942 --> 01:53:08.933
This well...

01:53:08.977 --> 01:53:10.171
If it's in there, David...

01:53:10.211 --> 01:53:11.803
can we block it up
somehow?

01:53:11.846 --> 01:53:13.677
I don't know.

01:53:13.715 --> 01:53:15.683
Yeah, we can... we can
block up that mine shaft.

01:53:15.717 --> 01:53:18.379
And that's what we're
going to do right now.

01:53:36.738 --> 01:53:40.299
So what does this Tak want?

01:53:40.342 --> 01:53:41.366
It doesn't matter.

01:53:41.409 --> 01:53:43.309
It doesn't matter?

01:53:44.779 --> 01:53:48.738
No, all that matters
is what God wants.

01:54:12.974 --> 01:54:14.703
No, we don't have
time for that.

01:54:14.743 --> 01:54:16.370
Let me do this.

01:54:16.411 --> 01:54:18.470
Are you nuts? This is
an explosive shed.

01:54:18.513 --> 01:54:19.980
Either it works
or it doesn't.

01:54:20.015 --> 01:54:22.108
Now get back.
Everybody get back.

01:54:22.150 --> 01:54:23.845
David, get back
and pray.

01:54:23.885 --> 01:54:25.443
Everybody get back!

01:54:39.067 --> 01:54:40.125
What is all that stuff?

01:54:40.168 --> 01:54:43.296
Ammonium nitrate.

01:54:43.338 --> 01:54:46.239
Tim McVeigh used it
in Oklahoma City.

01:54:46.274 --> 01:54:47.468
What the hell
are we doing here?

01:54:47.509 --> 01:54:48.806
You got a better idea?

01:54:48.843 --> 01:54:50.333
No.

01:54:50.378 --> 01:54:52.903
Let's just say
I got hit by a God bomb.

01:54:52.947 --> 01:54:54.414
Never mind about God.

01:54:54.449 --> 01:54:55.916
I'll settle for bombs.

01:54:59.020 --> 01:55:02.956
Steven, hold on.

01:55:02.991 --> 01:55:04.424
Dave's getting
a little antsy.

01:55:04.459 --> 01:55:07.019
Pretty soon now you're
going to have to grab him.

01:55:07.062 --> 01:55:08.427
Hold him tight.
Don't let go.

01:55:08.463 --> 01:55:10.431
All right.

01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:14.361
So what's the plan?

01:55:14.402 --> 01:55:16.370
We do what God
tells us to do.

01:55:16.404 --> 01:55:17.996
That's the plan.

01:55:18.039 --> 01:55:19.973
Come on.

01:55:26.314 --> 01:55:28.407
We ought to pray.

01:55:33.955 --> 01:55:36.219
Our father
who art in heaven...

01:55:36.257 --> 01:55:38.782
hallowed be thy name.

01:55:38.827 --> 01:55:41.660
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done...

01:55:41.696 --> 01:55:44.460
On earth as it is in heaven.

01:55:44.499 --> 01:55:46.865
Give us this day
our daily bread...

01:55:46.901 --> 01:55:49.233
and forgive us
our trespasses...

01:55:49.270 --> 01:55:52.262
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

01:55:52.307 --> 01:55:54.935
Lead us not into temptation...

01:55:54.976 --> 01:55:57.672
but deliver us from evil.

01:55:57.712 --> 01:55:58.974
For thine is the kingdom...

01:55:59.013 --> 01:56:03.006
The power, and the glory
forever and ever.

01:56:08.022 --> 01:56:09.455
I think
I'm supposed to go on...

01:56:09.491 --> 01:56:10.924
from here by myself.

01:56:10.959 --> 01:56:12.358
David, no.

01:56:12.393 --> 01:56:14.054
That's a load of crap, Dave.

01:56:17.198 --> 01:56:19.166
What do you mean?

01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:21.430
Exactly what I say.

01:56:21.469 --> 01:56:24.529
And don't give me that
"God told me to"...

01:56:24.572 --> 01:56:28.235
'cause right now, he's not
telling you anything, is he?

01:56:30.778 --> 01:56:32.712
All right,
you can lead the way.

01:56:32.747 --> 01:56:34.146
How about that?

01:56:36.117 --> 01:56:38.585
Let's go.

01:56:38.620 --> 01:56:39.951
Let's get this over with.

01:56:50.465 --> 01:56:51.955
Sorry, kid.
Sorry, kid.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:53.228
Sorry. Sorry.

01:56:53.268 --> 01:56:55.896
Just got a bad back.
It's all right.

01:56:55.937 --> 01:56:57.063
It's all right.

01:56:57.105 --> 01:56:59.369
Too much alcohol
and too much cigarettes.

01:56:59.407 --> 01:57:00.374
Do you want me
to take those bags?

01:57:00.408 --> 01:57:01.670
No.

01:57:01.709 --> 01:57:03.438
Not far to go.

01:57:05.346 --> 01:57:06.608
What do you know?

01:57:08.082 --> 01:57:09.447
What do I know?

01:57:09.484 --> 01:57:11.315
I want to get out of
here before dawn.

01:57:11.352 --> 01:57:12.649
Let's move it.

01:57:12.687 --> 01:57:13.813
Come on.

01:57:32.574 --> 01:57:34.769
There's something
in there.

01:57:41.249 --> 01:57:43.274
Someone help him!
Help him!

01:57:43.318 --> 01:57:45.149
I can't get him!

01:57:45.186 --> 01:57:46.653
It's going to tear
its head off!

01:57:48.623 --> 01:57:49.817
Kill it!

01:57:49.857 --> 01:57:51.916
Stop! Stop, please!

01:58:06.341 --> 01:58:09.105
He can't.

01:58:09.143 --> 01:58:11.771
God can't take them all.

01:58:11.813 --> 01:58:14.008
He can.

01:58:14.048 --> 01:58:16.278
He's God.

01:58:16.317 --> 01:58:18.615
And God is cruel.

01:58:18.653 --> 01:58:21.713
He's no better than Tak.

01:58:21.756 --> 01:58:24.020
Steve, get him!

01:58:24.058 --> 01:58:25.491
He can't take them
all and leave me!

01:58:25.526 --> 01:58:26.959
He can't take them
all and leave me!

01:58:26.995 --> 01:58:29.759
You want to know
how cruel your god is?

01:58:29.797 --> 01:58:31.492
How fantastically cruel?

01:58:36.104 --> 01:58:38.163
Sometimes he makes us live.

01:58:40.575 --> 01:58:41.564
Get him out of here.

01:58:41.609 --> 01:58:43.099
There's going to be
a big bang.

01:58:43.144 --> 01:58:45.169
- Boss?
- No time.

01:58:45.213 --> 01:58:47.010
David, you find
your friend Bryan.

01:58:47.048 --> 01:58:48.413
Make him your brother.

01:58:48.449 --> 01:58:49.609
Then keep telling yourself...

01:58:49.651 --> 01:58:51.949
there was an accident
out in the desert.

01:58:51.986 --> 01:58:53.078
A bad one.

01:58:53.121 --> 01:58:55.316
And you're the only survivor.

01:58:55.356 --> 01:58:56.846
That's not
what happened!

01:58:58.726 --> 01:59:00.023
That's exactly what happened.

01:59:00.061 --> 01:59:02.962
Now, get him out of here.
Go on. Move it.

01:59:05.199 --> 01:59:06.188
Come on.

01:59:15.777 --> 01:59:18.245
Right!

02:01:31.612 --> 02:01:34.206
Holy God...

02:01:34.248 --> 02:01:36.546
You're John Edward Marinville,
aren't you?

02:02:10.818 --> 02:02:13.286
You down there, Tak?

02:02:13.321 --> 02:02:15.551
Because I've
come for you.

02:02:15.590 --> 02:02:17.524
Come on, big brave
American writer.

02:02:17.558 --> 02:02:18.923
Tak ah lah!

02:03:29.897 --> 02:03:33.025
Stop!
I command you to stop!

02:03:33.067 --> 02:03:34.864
Tak commands you to stop!

02:03:34.902 --> 02:03:38.030
The heart of the unformed
commands you to stop!

02:03:38.072 --> 02:03:40.905
Donald Rumsfeld
demands you stop.

02:03:40.942 --> 02:03:43.467
Adam Sandler
demands you stop.

02:03:45.580 --> 02:03:47.810
Anne Coulter
demands you stop.

02:03:51.018 --> 02:03:54.749
Even if he can get to it,
how can he set that stuff off?

02:04:05.666 --> 02:04:07.190
I think he knows a way.

02:04:13.874 --> 02:04:16.741
I can give you anything
if you stop.

02:04:16.777 --> 02:04:17.971
Anything!

02:04:18.012 --> 02:04:19.639
Anything?

02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:21.443
Anything?

02:04:21.482 --> 02:04:23.245
Oh, man...

02:04:24.919 --> 02:04:28.013
Norman Mailer
burned my ass...

02:04:28.055 --> 02:04:29.613
<i>in a New York Times
book review.</i>

02:04:29.657 --> 02:04:33.923
What more
can a man want?

02:04:33.961 --> 02:04:37.226
You can't!
Os pa! You can't.

02:04:38.599 --> 02:04:41.227
You untalented bastard!

02:04:41.268 --> 02:04:45.261
Man, you said
the wrong thing there.

02:04:45.306 --> 02:04:46.796
You're useless.

02:04:46.841 --> 02:04:49.173
You're a drunk.

02:04:49.210 --> 02:04:52.111
You're a no good
for nothing piece of crap.

02:04:53.214 --> 02:04:55.546
No. Don't do it.

02:04:57.118 --> 02:05:00.918
You're a joke,
and you always have been!

02:05:00.955 --> 02:05:04.652
See, I hate critics.

02:05:14.435 --> 02:05:15.766
Come on!
Run for me now!

02:05:15.803 --> 02:05:17.100
Come on!

02:06:04.485 --> 02:06:07.852
It won't die, will it?

02:06:07.888 --> 02:06:10.686
It'll just keep
coming for us.

02:06:10.725 --> 02:06:11.817
Look...

02:06:11.859 --> 02:06:14.327
It's going away already.

02:06:15.463 --> 02:06:16.657
See?

02:06:19.734 --> 02:06:22.225
Let's get out
of here.

02:07:11.719 --> 02:07:13.152
Wait! Stop!

02:07:13.187 --> 02:07:14.484
Pull over.

02:07:14.522 --> 02:07:16.046
What is it?

02:07:16.090 --> 02:07:17.284
There's an overnight bag
in the backseat...

02:07:17.324 --> 02:07:19.087
if no one's stolen it.

02:07:48.255 --> 02:07:50.655
David, I think you
should come here.

02:08:03.237 --> 02:08:05.205
Any idea how
your school album...

02:08:05.239 --> 02:08:09.005
got in the backseat
of my car?

02:08:09.043 --> 02:08:12.240
That's, um,
my boss' handwriting.

02:08:12.279 --> 02:08:15.305
Are you sure?

02:08:15.349 --> 02:08:16.338
Are you kidding me?

02:08:16.383 --> 02:08:17.577
After a month of looking
over his shoulder...

02:08:17.618 --> 02:08:19.085
while he wrote "good luck"
and "best wishes"

02:08:19.119 --> 02:08:20.177
and "could you come up
to my room" in people's books?

02:08:20.221 --> 02:08:21.882
Yeah, I'm sure.

02:08:26.927 --> 02:08:27.951
The Bible reference.

02:08:27.995 --> 02:08:28.962
Do you know it?

02:08:28.996 --> 02:08:30.861
Sure.

02:08:32.199 --> 02:08:33.689
"God is love."

02:08:35.769 --> 02:08:37.066
What do you think, David?

02:08:38.239 --> 02:08:40.002
Is he love?

02:08:42.409 --> 02:08:44.468
Yeah.

02:08:44.511 --> 02:08:48.880
I guess so.

02:08:48.916 --> 02:08:52.317
I guess God's
sort of everything.

02:08:54.788 --> 02:08:56.619
That's what makes him God.
