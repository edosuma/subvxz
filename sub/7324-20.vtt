00:06.077 --> 00:08.539
THE SAME TEACHER,
SAME HOUSE,

00:08.539 --> 00:10.341
SAME FRIENDS.

08:03.854 --> 08:06.757
IS IT OKAY IF THE POLICE
ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS?

08:06.757 --> 08:08.589
ONLY IF YOU FEEL UP TO IT.

08:17.828 --> 08:22.873
DO YOU KNOW HIS NAME, HOLLY--
THE MAN THAT WAS KEEPING YOU?

08:22.873 --> 08:24.274
IT'S OKAY.

08:24.274 --> 08:26.837
(inhales) JOSEPH.

08:26.837 --> 08:29.079
JOSEPH INGLES.

08:29.079 --> 08:32.142
THAT'S GREAT.
REALLY HELPFUL.

08:32.142 --> 08:34.615
NOW CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING
ABOUT WHERE YOU WERE LIVING?

08:34.615 --> 08:35.946
WAS IT A HOUSE, AN APARTMENT?

08:35.946 --> 08:37.988
IT WAS A HOUSE.

08:37.988 --> 08:41.291
ONE STORY.
IT HAS A BASEMENT.

08:41.291 --> 08:42.923
DO YOU KNOW IF THERE WAS
ANY ROADS NEARBY?

08:42.923 --> 08:44.254
COULD YOU HEAR CARS?

08:44.254 --> 08:47.157
(voice breaks)
HE DIDN'T LET ME GO OUTSIDE.

08:47.157 --> 08:49.930
HOLLY, WE CAN STOP
IF YOU NEED TO.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.802
JUST LET US KNOW.

08:51.802 --> 08:55.105
OKAY, THEN. MAYBE WE SHOULD--
WE SHOULD TAKE A BREAK. SURE.

09:00.010 --> 09:01.171
YOU SHOULD'VE CALLED ME

09:01.171 --> 09:02.542
THE MINUTE YOU TALKED
TO THE POLICE.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.315
SHE HAD MAJOR BRAIN
AND ABDOMINAL INJURIES.

09:05.315 --> 09:07.618
MY FIRST CONCERN
WAS KEEPING HER ALIVE.

09:07.618 --> 09:10.020
I UNDERSTAND, BUT THE PROTOCOL
IS TO CALL PSYCH RIGHT AWAY.

09:10.020 --> 09:11.281
YOU DIDN'T,

09:11.281 --> 09:13.153
AND NOW OUR PATIENT
HAS BONDED WITH A SURGEON.

09:13.153 --> 09:14.755
HER NAME IS DR. GREY.

09:14.755 --> 09:17.087
DR. GREY. FINE.
THAT'S WHO HOLLY HAS CHOSEN.

09:17.087 --> 09:18.959
THERE'S NO
BREAKING THAT BOND NOW.

09:18.959 --> 09:20.560
WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:20.560 --> 09:21.862
DR. FINCHER THINKS

09:21.862 --> 09:23.994
THAT IT'S BEST
THAT YOU STAY WITH HOLLY,

09:23.994 --> 09:25.866
AT LEAST UNTIL
HER PARENTS ARRIVE.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.237
I HAVE NO PSYCH TRAINING.

09:27.237 --> 09:28.769
HOLLY SPENT
THE LAST 12 YEARS

09:28.769 --> 09:31.341
WITH LITTLE TO NO CONTROL
OVER ANYTHING IN HER LIFE.

09:31.341 --> 09:33.974
OUR JOB IS TO BREAK THAT PATTERN
BY LETTING HER KNOW THAT

09:33.974 --> 09:35.906
SHE AND SHE ALONE
IS IN CONTROL HERE.

09:35.906 --> 09:37.878
WHATEVER SHE WANTS,
SHE GETS,

09:37.878 --> 09:39.209
INCLUDING YOU.

09:39.209 --> 09:40.851
WE'LL HAVE TO WORK
TOGETHER ON THIS.

09:40.851 --> 09:42.052
OKAY.

09:42.052 --> 09:43.884
THANK YOU.
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

09:43.884 --> 09:45.956
THE FAMILY'S
WAITING FOR MY CALL.

09:49.289 --> 09:50.921
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO SAY,

09:50.921 --> 09:52.623
I'M FLATTERED
THAT SHE LIKES ME,

09:52.623 --> 09:54.124
BUT I HAVE A REALLY IMPORTANT
JOB INTERVIEW?

09:54.124 --> 09:55.295
I JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU,

09:55.295 --> 09:56.827
DID YOU NEED ME
TO RESCHEDULE YOUR FLIGHT?

09:56.827 --> 09:57.968
YES, I CAN TAKE
THE LAST FLIGHT OUT TONIGHT

09:57.968 --> 09:59.129
AND GET A CAB FROM HERE.

09:59.129 --> 10:01.071
OKAY.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.104
HANG IN THERE.
YEAH.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.976
TOUGH CASE.
MM-HMM.

10:05.976 --> 10:07.938
YOU'RE DOING A GOOD JOB.

10:07.938 --> 10:09.279
(sighs)
EXCEPT THAT I'M NOT.

10:09.279 --> 10:10.781
HER PARENTS
ARE ON THEIR WAY,

10:10.781 --> 10:11.882
AND THE PRESS ARE
FILLING UP THE PARKING LOT.

10:11.882 --> 10:14.284
I THINK I MIGHT BE
OUT OF MY DEPTH HERE.

10:16.046 --> 10:17.948
I'LL DEAL WITH THE PARENTS.

10:17.948 --> 10:19.089
YOU CALL PHIL IN SECURITY

10:19.089 --> 10:21.021
AND HAVE HIM
DOUBLE THE GUARD PRESENCE,

10:21.021 --> 10:22.152
THEN CALL HEATHER IN P.R.

10:22.152 --> 10:23.894
AND TELL HER
TO WRANGLE THE PRESS.

10:23.894 --> 10:25.956
YOU GO HOME, MAKE SURE
ALL YOUR SUITS ARE CLEAN.

10:25.956 --> 10:28.228
YOU'LL NEED 'EM
FOR THE PRESS CONFERENCES.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.900
YOU'LL BE OKAY, HUNT.

10:29.900 --> 10:31.401
(sighs)

10:35.936 --> 10:37.267
(lowered voice)
WHAT IS SHE LIKE?

10:37.267 --> 10:38.809
DID SHE SPEAK ENGLISH?

10:38.809 --> 10:40.871
OR IS IT LIKE THAT JODIE-FOSTER-
IN-THE-WOODS MOVIE?

10:40.871 --> 10:43.113
ENGLISH, ALTHOUGH SHE'S NOT
REALLY SPEAKING.

10:43.113 --> 10:44.644
SHE WAS JUST FLIPPING
THROUGH THE CHANNELS.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.116
I'M GUESSING THE TV RECEPTION
IN THE BASEMENT

10:46.116 --> 10:48.048
WASN'T THAT GREAT.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.980
ARE YOU TRYING TO GET OUT
OF YOUR INTERVIEW?

10:49.980 --> 10:52.052
THE PARENTS
ARE ON THEIR WAY.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.024
I'M GOING. I WANT TO.
REALLY?

10:54.024 --> 10:55.856
'CAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU WANT TO STAY

10:55.856 --> 10:57.888
AND RAISE...
HAPPY CUTIE BABIES

10:57.888 --> 10:59.259
WITH YOUR
HAPPY CUTIE HUSBAND.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.991
WHY ARE YOU SO FINE
WITH LEAVING?

11:00.991 --> 11:02.162
BECAUSE I'M A SURGEON,

11:02.162 --> 11:03.894
AND I WANT TO WORK
AT THE BEST HOSPITAL

11:03.894 --> 11:04.995
WITH THE BEST PEOPLE,

11:04.995 --> 11:06.136
AS SHOULD YOU.

11:06.136 --> 11:08.068
SINCE WHEN DID YOU
TURN INTO SUCH A SAP?

11:08.068 --> 11:09.900
WHAT DO YOU GUYS KNOW
ABOUT CARSON METHODIST?

11:09.900 --> 11:11.441
NOTHING. I'D LIKE
TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.

11:11.441 --> 11:13.273
(sighs) IT'S IN TOLEDO.
OR AN HOUR OUTSIDE, I GUESS.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.945
I INTERVIEW NEXT WEEK.
WHERE'S TOLEDO?

11:14.945 --> 11:16.176
CANADA.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.978
OHIO. A QUARTER OF A MILLION
PEOPLE LIVE THERE.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.750
BUT THIS IS
AN HOUR OUTSIDE.

11:19.750 --> 11:22.012
ROBBINS SET IT UP FOR ME.
I-I CAN'T NOT GO.

11:22.012 --> 11:24.114
I'VE ENJOYED OUR TIME TOGETHER
THESE PAST FEW YEARS.

11:24.114 --> 11:25.285
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:25.285 --> 11:26.787
WE ARE OFFICIALLY
ON DIFFERENT CAREER PATHS.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.118
IT'S ONLY POLITE
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

11:28.118 --> 11:31.021
(crying) OH, MY GOD. HOLLY?

11:31.021 --> 11:32.692
IT'S HER.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.125
(sobs) IT'S HER.

11:35.125 --> 11:38.068
(sobbing)

11:38.068 --> 11:39.770
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

11:39.770 --> 11:42.132
I'D KNOW YOU ANYWHERE.
YOU ARE...

11:42.132 --> 11:44.074
STILL MY PERFECT BABY GIRL.

11:44.074 --> 11:46.837
HOLLY,
I KNOW IT'S SOON, BUT...

11:46.837 --> 11:48.438
I WOULD LIKE TO HUG YOU.

11:48.438 --> 11:50.180
WOULD THAT BE OKAY?

12:00.420 --> 12:02.793
OH.

12:02.793 --> 12:06.026
OH, MY BABY GIRL.

12:06.026 --> 12:09.760
(crying) MY BABY GIRL.

12:11.231 --> 12:14.164
(continues crying)
BABY GIRL.

12:21.471 --> 12:22.813
WE'RE A NEW PROGRAM,

12:22.813 --> 12:23.974
SO YOU'RE ON THE VERGE
OF SOMETHING GREAT HERE.

12:23.974 --> 12:25.145
YOU'RE LUCKY
YOU'RE GETTING IN NOW.

12:25.145 --> 12:26.476
REALLY?

12:26.476 --> 12:27.848
OH, YEAH. WE'RE EVEN ABOUT
TO UPGRADE OUR NICU.

12:27.848 --> 12:28.819
JUST WAITING ON
THE FINAL ROUND OF FUNDING.

12:28.819 --> 12:30.220
IN FACT, THAT'S WHY
WE WERE SO EXCITED

12:30.220 --> 12:32.222
TO GET DR. ROBBINS' CALL.

12:32.222 --> 12:34.424
SHE TOLD US ALL ABOUT
THAT MONEY

12:34.424 --> 12:36.526
YOU RAISED
FOR THOSE AFRICAN KIDS.
(telephone ringing)

12:36.526 --> 12:38.158
MELINDA, THESE ARE
THE DISCHARGE PAPERS

12:38.158 --> 12:39.860
FOR THE LIVER TRANSPLANT BOY.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.031
COULD YOU PREP 'EM
FOR TRANSPORT?

12:41.031 --> 12:42.933
YOU'RE DISCHARGING
A LIVER TRANSPLANT?

12:42.933 --> 12:45.295
WE'RE NOT EQUIPPED TO DEAL
WITH CASES THAT SERIOUS YET.

12:45.295 --> 12:47.838
SO WE'RE SHIPPING HIM TO
OUR SISTER HOSPITAL IN TOLEDO.

12:47.838 --> 12:49.940
YOU HUNGRY?

12:49.940 --> 12:51.972
IT'S MAKE-YOUR-OWN-SUNDAE DAY
AT THE CAFETERIA.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.773
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.876
(ring)

12:55.876 --> 12:56.977
OHH.

12:56.977 --> 12:58.008
(horn honks in distance)

12:58.008 --> 12:59.549
(bag thuds)

13:04.384 --> 13:07.988
(drilling in distance)

13:07.988 --> 13:09.960
OH!
OH, HEY. WHOA. SORRY.

13:09.960 --> 13:11.291
UH, UH,
I THOUGHT YOU WERE...

13:11.291 --> 13:12.893
(sighs) I THOUGHT YOU WERE
THE KIDNAPPER.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.794
NO, NO, I--YOU HEAR
THEY CAUGHT HIM LAST NIGHT?

13:14.794 --> 13:16.096
UH, YEAH.

13:16.096 --> 13:18.198
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE, ACTUALLY.
I NEEDED MORE SUITS.

13:18.198 --> 13:19.900
YOU KNOW,
FOR THE PRESS CONFERENCES.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.903
I-I THOUGHT YOU WERE
STUDYING AT MEREDITH'S.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.574
WELL, I CAME HOME
TO TAKE A SHOWER.

13:24.574 --> 13:25.976
OH.

13:25.976 --> 13:29.980
WELL, I'LL... CLEAR UP
AND I'LL GET OUT OF YOUR HAIR.

13:33.543 --> 13:34.915
OKAY.

13:36.246 --> 13:38.889
YOU KNOW,
JUST LEAVE IT.

13:38.889 --> 13:40.050
STAY HERE.

13:40.050 --> 13:41.491
OH, NO, NO, NO, I--

13:41.491 --> 13:43.093
NO, I'M STAYING AT MEREDITH'S
UNTIL THE BOARDS.

13:43.093 --> 13:46.226
I'M NEVER HERE.
SO JUST STAY.

13:47.557 --> 13:48.929
YOU SURE?

13:50.500 --> 13:52.202
UNTIL THE BOARDS ARE OVER.

13:54.004 --> 13:56.006
OKAY.

13:56.006 --> 13:58.608
I'LL, UM... I'LL GO NOW.

13:58.608 --> 14:01.341
GIVE YOU SOME PRIVACY.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.874
(Meredith) THIS IS, I THINK,

14:03.874 --> 14:05.445
YOUR FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.317
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

14:07.317 --> 14:10.180
(people speaking indistinctly)

14:10.180 --> 14:12.883
6th BIRTHDAY.

14:12.883 --> 14:14.354
LOOKS LIKE THAT'S WHERE
THE BUNNY CAME FROM.

14:16.226 --> 14:19.389
SO TODAY DR. TORRES WILL BE
REALIGNING YOUR ARM.

14:19.389 --> 14:21.391
YOU'LL HAVE A LOT MORE MOBILITY
IN YOUR ELBOWS.

14:21.391 --> 14:23.363
DID THEY REALLY THINK
THAT THIS WOULD WORK?

14:23.363 --> 14:27.167
GIVE ME SOME PHOTO ALBUMS
AND A STUFFED ANIMAL,

14:27.167 --> 14:28.868
AND WE'D BE NORMAL AGAIN?

14:28.868 --> 14:31.501
NO, I THINK THAT THEY ARE JUST
TRYING TO HELP YOU REMEMBER

14:31.501 --> 14:34.004
BECAUSE YOU WERE ONLY 6.

14:34.004 --> 14:38.248
WELL, THEN TELL THEM
THAT I REMEMBER ALL OF IT,

14:38.248 --> 14:43.283
THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL
AND MY 6th BIRTHDAY.

14:43.283 --> 14:44.985
JUST LIKE I REMEMBER

14:44.985 --> 14:47.517
THE FIRST TIME HE MADE ME
TAKE MY CLOTHES OFF

14:47.517 --> 14:49.659
AND HOW HARD HE KICKED ME

14:49.659 --> 14:51.992
WHEN I DIDN'T ACT LIKE
I LIKED IT

14:51.992 --> 14:54.294
OR HOW HIS BREATH
SMELLED LIKE CIGARETTES,

14:54.294 --> 14:58.228
HOW I COULD'VE GOTTEN AWAY
A BUNCH OF TIMES,

14:58.228 --> 15:00.130
BUT EVERY TIME
I MADE IT OUTSIDE,

15:00.130 --> 15:03.473
I COULD HEAR HIS VOICE
INSIDE MY HEAD...

15:03.473 --> 15:06.937
THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT ME,
THAT I WAS DEAD TO THEM,

15:06.937 --> 15:09.179
AND THAT THE ONLY REASON
I FINALLY RAN AWAY

15:09.179 --> 15:11.111
WAS BECAUSE HE TOLD ME

15:11.111 --> 15:14.014
THAT HE WAS GONNA TAKE
ANOTHER GIRL...

15:14.014 --> 15:16.346
BECAUSE I WAS TOO OLD
AND USED UP

15:16.346 --> 15:19.919
AND DISGUSTING NOW.

15:23.053 --> 15:27.027
TELL THEM THAT.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.999
(camera shutter clicking,
indistinct conversations)

15:28.999 --> 15:30.500
(clears throat)
WE WILL THEN REPAIR,

15:30.500 --> 15:33.203
UH, NUMEROUS FRACTURES
THAT NEVER HEALED PROPERLY,

15:33.203 --> 15:34.634
UH, THE FIRST TIME.

15:34.634 --> 15:37.067
THE PATIENT IS IN GOOD SPIRITS,

15:37.067 --> 15:39.439
AND WE'RE GRATEFUL
FOR THE CHANCE TO ALLOW HER

15:39.439 --> 15:42.042
TO HEAL IN A WAY
THAT WASN'T POSITIVE--

15:42.042 --> 15:43.713
PAUSIBLE--POSSIBLE BEFORE.

15:43.713 --> 15:46.246
WE HOPE--
UH, THANK YOU, DR. TORRES.

15:46.246 --> 15:48.348
(man) EXCUSE ME!
WHAT ABOUT HER--
(man) HOW DOES HOLLY FEEL
ABOUT JOSEPH BEING CAPTURED?

15:48.348 --> 15:50.080
AND HER PARENTS--
WHEN CAN WE TALK TO THEM?

15:50.080 --> 15:52.722
LOOK, I'M SURE THE WHEELERS
WOULD APPRECIATE SOME PRIVACY--

15:52.722 --> 15:54.554
IS IT TRUE HOLLY'S REFUSING
TO SPEAK TO THEM?

15:54.554 --> 15:56.086
WHERE ARE HER PARENTS?
(reporters all speaking at once)

15:56.086 --> 15:58.228
IT'S
A VERY COMPLICATED SITUATION.

15:58.228 --> 16:01.161
IT'S NOT COMPLICATED.
IT'S NOT COMPLICATED AT ALL.
FRANK.

16:01.161 --> 16:02.993
THE GUY'S A MONSTER WHO STOLE
OUR KID FOR 12 YEARS,

16:02.993 --> 16:05.165
AND WE'RE THE ONES
WHO ARE ALLOWED TO SEE HER

16:05.165 --> 16:06.666
FOR ONLY
ONE SUPERVISED HOUR A DAY.

16:06.666 --> 16:07.998
HOLLY'S IN A FRAGILE STATE.

16:07.998 --> 16:09.739
SHE'LL NEED ALL OF US
TO ABIDE BY HER WISHES,

16:09.739 --> 16:11.601
EVEN IF THAT MEANS
GIVING HER SPACE.

16:11.601 --> 16:13.303
SHE WAS BRAINWASHED BY HIM.
SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT SHE WANTS.

16:13.303 --> 16:14.574
(Fincher) POSSIBLY.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.976
BUT SHE STILL HAS FEELINGS
OF BLAME AND RESENTMENT

16:16.976 --> 16:19.109
THAT SHE HAS TO PROCESS.

16:19.109 --> 16:20.450
RIGHT NOW YOU'RE STILL
STRANGERS TO HER.

16:20.450 --> 16:22.512
'CAUSE YOU WON'T LET US GO
IN THERE AND BE HER PARENTS!

16:22.512 --> 16:23.583
(knock on door)

16:25.755 --> 16:27.187
DID YOU SHOW HER
THE PHOTO ALBUM?

16:27.187 --> 16:28.388
DID SHE REMEMBER?

16:30.460 --> 16:32.292
NOT EVEN THE BUNNY?
SHE LOVED THAT THING.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.364
(sighs)
SHE DIDN'T REMEMBER.

16:34.364 --> 16:36.066
I'M SORRY.

16:40.170 --> 16:42.432
SHE'LL COME BACK TO YOU.

16:42.432 --> 16:43.773
IT MIGHT TAKE SOME TIME,

16:43.773 --> 16:46.536
BUT THE MEMORIES
ARE STILL THERE.

16:46.536 --> 16:49.279
YOU JUST HAVE TO BE PATIENT.

16:49.279 --> 16:52.182
(April) OH, HEY, CHIEF.

16:52.182 --> 16:53.743
UM, I HAVEN'T HEARD BACK
YET FROM NORTHWESTERN,

16:53.743 --> 16:55.485
AND I KNOW YOU'RE CLOSE
WITH DR. MITCHELL.

16:55.485 --> 16:57.347
HAVE YOU, UH,
HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO HIM?

16:57.347 --> 16:59.018
UH, YES, HE SAID
YOUR RESUME WAS IMPRESSIVE.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.690
OH, THANK GOODNESS.
(laughs)

17:00.690 --> 17:02.352
KEEP YOUR OPTIONS OPEN,
THOUGH.

17:02.352 --> 17:04.594
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? HE SAID
HE THOUGHT I WAS IMPRESSIVE.

17:04.594 --> 17:06.096
HE ALSO SAID HE WASN'T SURE

17:06.096 --> 17:08.058
IF IT WAS A MATCH
PERSONALITY-WISE.

17:08.058 --> 17:10.560
PERSONALITY? I'M--
I'M ASKING FOR A JOB,

17:10.560 --> 17:11.561
NOT A DATE TO THE PROM.

17:11.561 --> 17:12.562
(cell phone rings)

17:12.562 --> 17:13.703
(whispers) DAMN REPORTERS.

17:13.703 --> 17:15.034
W--
(normal voice) SORRY. HELLO.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.166
(woman) DR. LLEWELLYN
TO O.R. 2.

17:16.166 --> 17:17.207
DR. LLEWELLYN TO O.R. 2.

17:17.207 --> 17:18.208
UGH.

17:18.208 --> 17:19.469
(Callie) CHISEL, PLEASE.

17:19.469 --> 17:20.810
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

17:20.810 --> 17:23.713
MAN, LOOK AT ALL
THIS CALLUS FORMATION.

17:23.713 --> 17:25.715
HE WOULD'VE HAD TO BREAK
THIS ARM THREE OR FOUR TIMES

17:25.715 --> 17:27.477
TO GET THIS AMOUNT
OF SCAR TISSUE.

17:27.477 --> 17:29.179
(pounds)

17:29.179 --> 17:32.122
AND THE HUMERUS IS PRETTY
STRONG, EVEN IN A YOUNG KID.

17:32.122 --> 17:33.653
(pounds)

17:33.653 --> 17:35.825
(sighs) KINDA MAKES YOU SICK

17:35.825 --> 17:37.557
JUST THINKING ABOUT
THE AMOUNT OF...

17:37.557 --> 17:38.728
FORCE IT TOOK TO BREAK IT--

17:38.728 --> 17:41.161
CAN WE TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE?

17:41.161 --> 17:42.592
(monitor beeping steadily)

17:44.063 --> 17:48.738
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, WHO KNOWS
WHAT THEY HEAR SUBCONSCIOUSLY?

17:48.738 --> 17:51.471
SO IT...

17:51.471 --> 17:53.573
MAYBE IT WOULDN'T HURT
TO COME UP WITH A CONVERSATION

17:53.573 --> 17:56.706
ABOUT SOMETHING OTHER THAN
EVERY PARENT'S WORST NIGHTMARE.

17:56.706 --> 17:58.708
(exhales)

17:58.708 --> 18:01.311
AVERY SCORED AN INTERVIEW
AT U.C.L.A.

18:01.311 --> 18:03.113
THAT IS NOT WHAT SHE MEANT.

18:03.113 --> 18:05.315
NO, THAT--THAT'S GOOD.
LET'S HEAR ABOUT THAT.

18:05.315 --> 18:07.817
WELL, IT'S A TOP-10 PROGRAM,
WHICH IS IMPRESSIVE.

18:07.817 --> 18:09.219
OF COURSE, IT'S JUST AS MUCH
A REFLECTION

18:09.219 --> 18:12.262
ON ME AS A TEACHER
AS IT IS HIS SURGICAL SKILL.

18:12.262 --> 18:14.494
OKAY.

18:14.494 --> 18:15.765
(pounds)

18:17.127 --> 18:18.097
(pounding)

18:18.097 --> 18:20.200
HEY. HOW WAS CANADA?

18:20.200 --> 18:22.532
UGH. CANADA WOULD'VE BEEN
BETTER THAN THAT DUMP.

18:22.532 --> 18:24.374
YOU WANT ME TO CALL
THE CHIEF AT DUKE?

18:24.374 --> 18:26.376
HE WANTS ME SO BAD,
HE'LL DO ANYTHING I TELL HIM,

18:26.376 --> 18:27.777
EVEN ACCEPT YOU.
(Callie) DRILL, PLEASE.

18:27.777 --> 18:29.239
(sighs)

18:29.239 --> 18:30.540
WHAT'S HUNT GONNA DO ANYWAY
IF YOU LEAVE?

18:30.540 --> 18:32.212
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.244
YOU SAY "DUKE,"
AND HE'S ON THE NEXT PLANE.

18:34.244 --> 18:35.745
GUY'S SO WHIPPED.

18:35.745 --> 18:37.617
SHE'S NOT GOING TO DUKE,

18:37.617 --> 18:39.118
AND NEITHER ARE YOU.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.450
THIS IS A GREAT PROGRAM,

18:40.450 --> 18:42.292
AND WE'D BE CRAZY
TO LEAVE.

18:42.292 --> 18:44.594
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU WANT TO PLAY
SHRINK TO YOUR PATIENT

18:44.594 --> 18:46.226
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.457
SHE IMPRINTED ON ME.
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

18:47.457 --> 18:49.199
HOW'S SHE DOING ANYWAY?

18:49.199 --> 18:50.730
GREAT. I MEAN, BETTER.

18:50.730 --> 18:53.733
I FOUND TWO GRANOLA BARS
UNDER HER BED THIS MORNING.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.206
BUT AT LEAST SHE DIDN'T LIE
ABOUT WHERE THEY CAME FROM.

18:56.206 --> 18:58.137
FINCHER SAYS SHE'S
TALKING MORE IN THERAPY,

18:58.137 --> 19:01.140
ALTHOUGH SHE'S NOT TALKING
TO FRANK AND KATHLEEN.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.173
SHE WAS BEING KEPT 5 MILES
AWAY FROM THEIR HOUSE,

19:03.173 --> 19:05.175
AND THEY DIDN'T FIND HER.

19:05.175 --> 19:07.617
YOU DON'T JUST GET OVER
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

19:07.617 --> 19:09.819
MAYBE SHE COULD
MOVE IN WITH YOU

19:09.819 --> 19:11.451
WHEN WE ALL LEAVE.

19:18.758 --> 19:22.292
ADELE, BABY.

19:22.292 --> 19:23.433
(Adele giggling)

19:23.433 --> 19:24.764
ARE YOU READY FOR DINNER?

19:24.764 --> 19:27.467
AAH! THIS IS A PRIVATE ROOM!

19:27.467 --> 19:28.668
GET OUT!

19:28.668 --> 19:30.740
YOU GET THAT MAN
OUT OF HERE!

19:30.740 --> 19:31.901
DR. WEBBER--

19:31.901 --> 19:33.273
IT'S ASSAULT.
SHE WAS VULNERABLE.

19:33.273 --> 19:34.504
YOU JUST DON'T LET A MAN--
PLEASE, SIR--

19:34.504 --> 19:35.705
HE TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF MY WIFE.

19:35.705 --> 19:36.876
HE'S A PREDATOR.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.748
IF YOU DON'T GET HIM OUT,
I WILL SUE.

19:38.748 --> 19:40.510
DR. WEBBER,
ALLAN HAS ALZHEIMER'S.

19:40.510 --> 19:41.681
HIS IS QUITE PROGRESSED,

19:41.681 --> 19:43.483
FURTHER ALONG
THAN YOUR WIFE'S, EVEN.

19:43.483 --> 19:45.455
HE'S NOT A PREDATOR.

19:45.455 --> 19:47.186
HE'S A PATIENT HERE.

19:56.626 --> 19:57.897
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU

19:57.897 --> 20:00.700
THAT COLUMBIA HAS
A CUTTING-EDGE CARDIO PROGRAM.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.232
SO I HOPE THE FACT THAT
I'VE FLOWN CROSS COUNTRY

20:02.232 --> 20:03.703
TO COME KNOCKING
ON YOUR DOOR

20:03.703 --> 20:05.335
SHOWS YOU JUST HOW SERIOUS
WE ARE ABOUT--

20:05.335 --> 20:06.506
CAN YOU PASS ME THE BUTTER?

20:06.506 --> 20:08.978
(indistinct conversations)

20:08.978 --> 20:10.740
YEAH.

20:10.740 --> 20:11.841
THANK YOU.

20:11.841 --> 20:14.714
YOU SHOULD COME TO NEW YORK
TO VISIT.

20:14.714 --> 20:15.885
YOU LIKE THEATER?

20:15.885 --> 20:17.417
I CAN GET YOU TICKETS
TO ANY MUSICAL YOU'D LIKE.

20:17.417 --> 20:18.718
OH, I HATE MUSICALS.

20:18.718 --> 20:19.819
I DO LIKE WINE, THOUGH.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.691
WAITER.

20:21.691 --> 20:23.653
MORE WINE.
COMING.

20:23.653 --> 20:25.255
(crunches)

20:25.255 --> 20:26.756
THERE'S AN OLD FRACTURE
IN YOUR PELVIS

20:26.756 --> 20:28.398
THAT DR. TORRES
IS CONCERNED ABOUT.

20:28.398 --> 20:30.229
IT'S CALLED
AN AVULSION FRACTURE.

20:30.229 --> 20:33.002
AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT MIGHT
HAVE HAPPENED WHEN YOU RAN AWAY,

20:33.002 --> 20:34.834
BUT THIS INJURY
IS A LOT OLDER THAN THAT.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.606
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN THE PAIN FIRST STARTED

20:36.606 --> 20:39.709
OR ANYTHING THAT MIGHT'VE
HAPPENED RIGHT BEFORE THAT,

20:39.709 --> 20:41.741
A... A FALL, MAYBE?

20:41.741 --> 20:43.613
NO, I-I-I DON'T.

20:43.613 --> 20:45.445
MM.

20:45.445 --> 20:46.916
OH...

20:46.916 --> 20:49.779
MAYBE IT HAPPENED
AFTER I HAD THE BABY.

20:50.980 --> 20:53.853
IT WAS A FEW YEARS AGO.

20:53.853 --> 20:56.356
I-I THINK IT DIED.

20:56.356 --> 20:59.659
I COULDN'T WALK
FOR A LONG TIME AFTER. I-I...

20:59.659 --> 21:01.591
IT MUST HAVE HAPPENED THEN,
RIGHT?

21:01.591 --> 21:04.434
(Callie) UH...
(clears throat) THAT'S...

21:04.434 --> 21:07.337
YES, THAT'S...

21:07.337 --> 21:08.838
I'M SORRY.

21:08.838 --> 21:09.969
I DIDN'T--
(Kathleen) NO.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.541
SHOULD--
NO. IT'S--

21:11.541 --> 21:12.772
SHOULD I NOT
HAVE SAID ANYTHING?

21:12.772 --> 21:14.604
EXCUSE ME.

21:14.604 --> 21:16.005
IT'S OKAY.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.281
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

21:22.281 --> 21:23.783
SORRY I'M LATE.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.986
NO, IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE
YOU'VE BEEN IN MY O.R.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.618
I'M HONORED YOU SHOWED UP.

21:28.618 --> 21:29.959
HAS GREY BEEN DITCHING YOU,
TOO, FOR INTERVIEWS?

21:29.959 --> 21:32.021
CRISTINA HAS BEEN
SO DISTRACTED.

21:32.021 --> 21:33.893
MEREDITH, DO YOU KNOW
WHO SHE'S TALKING TO TODAY?

21:33.893 --> 21:34.994
STANFORD, I THINK.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.366
STANFORD? WH--

21:36.366 --> 21:37.967
SINCE WHEN HAS SHE
BEEN INTERESTED IN STANFORD?

21:37.967 --> 21:39.499
YOU BLAME HER?

21:39.499 --> 21:41.401
YOU'D BE A FOOL NOT TO
PURSUE CARDIO AT STANFORD.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.673
KINDA LIKE...
GENERAL AT THE BRIGHAM.

21:43.673 --> 21:45.435
I TOLD YOU,
THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR

21:45.435 --> 21:47.807
WAS VERY UNDERSTANDING
WHEN I CALLED.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.739
AND YOU BELIEVED HER
AFTER CANCELING THREE TIMES?

21:49.739 --> 21:51.811
YOU KNOW HOW MANY STRINGS I HAD
TO PULL TO GET YOU IN THERE?

21:51.811 --> 21:53.312
WELL, THE CHIEF ASSIGNED
THIS CASE TO ME.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.584
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

21:54.584 --> 21:56.816
STANFORD? I MEAN,
THAT IS JUST--THAT'S FAR.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.888
HUNT IS REALLY OKAY
WITH THAT?

22:00.390 --> 22:01.721
(clears throat)

22:01.721 --> 22:04.053
GREY, WILL YOU, UH,
TIE THESE VESSELS OFF?

22:04.053 --> 22:05.425
MM-HMM.

22:05.425 --> 22:06.896
(suction gurgles)

22:06.896 --> 22:08.798
SHE'S BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH.

22:08.798 --> 22:09.859
SHE DOESN'T NEED TO WORRY
ABOUT SOME JERK

22:09.859 --> 22:11.030
TAKING HER PICTURE
IN THE HALL.

22:11.030 --> 22:12.802
I AM SO SORRY.

22:12.802 --> 22:14.333
WELL, DON'T BE, JUST...

22:14.333 --> 22:16.506
HELP ME, OKAY?

22:16.506 --> 22:18.638
HELP ME KEEP HER SAFE.

22:18.638 --> 22:20.440
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

22:20.440 --> 22:23.473
(people speaking indistinctly)

22:23.473 --> 22:26.075
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

22:26.075 --> 22:28.448
(sighs)

22:33.082 --> 22:35.084
(knocks on door)

22:35.084 --> 22:37.687
HEY, UM, TEDDY NEEDED YOU
TO SIGN OFF

22:37.687 --> 22:39.729
ON THE STEM CELL PAPERWORK.
OKAY.

22:45.765 --> 22:47.497
PEOPLE HAVE CAMERAS
ON THEIR PHONES.

22:47.497 --> 22:49.939
HE CAN'T EXPECT YOU TO BAN
PHONES FROM THE HOSPITAL.

22:49.939 --> 22:53.002
NO, NO, BUT I CAN MAKE SURE
THAT THE HALLWAYS ARE CLEAR

22:53.002 --> 22:55.905
BEFORE THEY MOVE HER,
OR SECURITY KEEPS A LOOKOUT.

22:55.905 --> 22:57.907
I'M... (sighs)
I'M NOT THINKING.

22:57.907 --> 23:00.580
I'M MAKING MISTAKES...

23:00.580 --> 23:01.881
IN OVER MY HEAD.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.514
(scoffs)

23:04.514 --> 23:06.385
I WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE THE CHIEF.

23:06.385 --> 23:10.059
I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE
THIS... GUY. I'M...

23:10.059 --> 23:11.861
(sighs) I MEAN,
HOW AM I THE GUY

23:11.861 --> 23:14.764
THAT ENDS UP MAKING
THIS MAN'S DAUGHTER MORE HURT

23:14.764 --> 23:16.065
THAN SHE ALREADY IS?

23:16.065 --> 23:18.127
I'M JUST--I'M FAILING.
I'M...

23:22.872 --> 23:24.534
YOU'RE DOING
THE BEST YOU CAN.

23:24.534 --> 23:25.975
(clipboard clatters)

23:32.712 --> 23:33.883
(baby-talk voice)
AND HOW WAS YOUR DAY,

23:33.883 --> 23:34.944
MY LITTLE SCOOTCHIE COO?

23:34.944 --> 23:36.916
DID YOU JUST HAVE SO MUCH FUN
PLAYING WITH ZOLA?

23:36.916 --> 23:38.417
YOU KNOW, SHE DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND YOU ANY BETTER

23:38.417 --> 23:39.789
THE MORE IDIOTIC YOU SOUND.

23:39.789 --> 23:41.591
(baby-talk voice)
HEY, ZOLA. GOOD EVENING.

23:41.591 --> 23:43.523
GOOD EVENING. HOW ARE YOU?
(giggles)

23:43.523 --> 23:45.725
TUCK?

23:45.725 --> 23:46.896
TUCKER?

23:46.896 --> 23:48.998
(woman) HEY, DON'T BE SHY.
(giggles)

23:48.998 --> 23:51.000
HEY, UH, WHERE'S TUCK?

23:51.000 --> 23:52.802
(Zola continues giggling)

23:52.802 --> 23:55.204
I'M NOT SURE.
HE WAS... JUST HERE.

23:55.204 --> 23:56.706
YOU DON'T KNOW?

23:56.706 --> 23:58.838
YOU KNOW IT'S YOUR JOB
TO KNOW WHERE MY SON IS?

23:58.838 --> 24:00.039
TARA, WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HIM?

24:00.039 --> 24:03.042
A FEW MINUTES AGO.
I SWEAR, HE WAS RIGHT HERE.

24:03.042 --> 24:05.044
A FEW...

24:05.044 --> 24:06.516
(woman) TRY IT AGAIN.

24:06.516 --> 24:08.147
WH--

24:14.924 --> 24:18.588
UM, CALL, A-A CODE PINK.

24:18.588 --> 24:19.759
RIGHT NOW.

24:19.759 --> 24:21.060
WHAT? NO, THERE'S A PROTOCOL
FOR A CODE--

24:21.060 --> 24:23.893
HEY, HEY, MY SON IS MISSING.
OKAY? HE'S GONE.

24:23.893 --> 24:26.996
(voice breaking) YOU TOOK YOUR
EYES OFF OF HIM, AND HE'S GONE.

24:26.996 --> 24:28.738
NOW YOU PICK UP THAT PHONE,

24:28.738 --> 24:31.070
AND YOU MAKE THAT CALL
RIGHT NOW,

24:31.070 --> 24:32.942
OR I SWEAR TO GOD,
I WILL HAVE YOUR THROAT.

24:32.942 --> 24:35.004
TARA, JUST DO IT.

24:35.004 --> 24:37.206
JUST CALL THE CODE PINK!

24:37.206 --> 24:38.578
I'LL LOOK FOR HIM.

24:38.578 --> 24:39.909
(Tara) YES,
WE HAVE A CODE PINK.

24:39.909 --> 24:42.912
A 5-YEAR-OLD BOY, MISSING I--
I'M NOT SURE HOW LONG.

24:42.912 --> 24:46.916
UM, I DON'T KNOW.

24:46.916 --> 24:49.058
HE'S WEARING A GREEN-STRIPED...
PLEASE DON'T JUST STAND THERE.

24:49.058 --> 24:52.091
OKAY? LOOK. HELP ME FIND HIM.
OH, GOD.

24:52.091 --> 24:55.094
(crying) HE'S PROBABLY SCREAMING
'CAUSE HE KNOWS TO SCREAM

24:55.094 --> 24:57.166
IF THERE'S A-A STRANGER.

24:57.166 --> 24:59.999
JUST... OH, GOD.
HE'S SCREAMING.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.001
HE'S SCREAM...

25:02.001 --> 25:03.703
DR. BAILEY.

25:03.703 --> 25:05.935
WHAT?

25:05.935 --> 25:07.707
HE HAD A NOSEBLEED.

25:07.707 --> 25:10.740
I-I TOOK HIM TO THE NURSE.

25:12.712 --> 25:14.614
(chuckles) WHAT? (sniffles)

25:14.614 --> 25:17.286
WHAT? THERE YOU ARE!

25:17.286 --> 25:19.288

OH, MY GOODNESS.

25:23.252 --> 25:24.854
OH, WELL, THEN I GUESS, UM...

25:24.854 --> 25:25.995
(Tara) YES, YOU CAN CANCEL...

25:25.995 --> 25:27.156
WHERE WAS HE?
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO...

25:27.156 --> 25:28.527
NOSEBLEED.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.630

25:30.630 --> 25:33.262
YEAH? YEAH?
WELL, LET'S GO HOME.

25:37.106 --> 25:41.911
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU HAD A NOSEBLEED.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.577

25:47.577 --> 25:48.748
THAT SHOULD JUST ABOUT
DO IT.

25:48.748 --> 25:50.850
IMPRESSIVE.

25:50.850 --> 25:53.753
MOST OF OUR CANDIDATES
CAN'T GET THE DETAIL

25:53.753 --> 25:55.254

25:55.254 --> 25:58.327
YEAH, WELL, UH, IF THIS WHOLE
SURGEON THING DOESN'T PAN OUT,

25:58.327 --> 26:00.229
THEN I GUESS I COULD TAKE
MY ACT ON THE ROAD.

26:00.229 --> 26:01.591
YOU KNOW, JUST SET UP
A LITTLE WHITTLING BOOTH

26:01.591 --> 26:02.792
AT A COUNTY FAIR.

26:02.792 --> 26:04.333
(laughs) I THINK PEOPLE
WOULD PAY GOOD MONEY FOR THAT,

26:04.333 --> 26:05.735
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY HEAR,

26:05.735 --> 26:08.297
IT'S MADE BY
HARPER AVERY'S GRANDSON.

26:08.297 --> 26:09.799
WHICH REMINDS ME,

26:09.799 --> 26:11.300
DO YOU THINK THAT
HE'D EVER BE INTERESTED

26:11.300 --> 26:12.742
IN DOING A LECTURE HERE?

26:12.742 --> 26:14.644
WE'VE BEEN AFTER HIM
FOR YEARS.

26:14.644 --> 26:15.775
HMM.

26:15.775 --> 26:18.307
(inhales deeply)

26:18.307 --> 26:19.849
YOU'RE A NAME BRAND.

26:19.849 --> 26:21.310
YOU'RE LIKE THE FREAKIN'
RITZ-CARLTON OF SURGERY.

26:21.310 --> 26:23.052
WHO CARES IF THAT'S WHY
THEY WANT YOU?

26:23.052 --> 26:25.885
BECAUSE HE KNOWS DEEP DOWN
HE'S MORE OF A ROADSIDE MOTEL.

26:25.885 --> 26:28.017
OH, OH, OH,
SHE'S GOING FOR THE SOUP.

26:28.017 --> 26:30.760
BOLD MOVE. SHE'S GONNA
HAVE TO TALK TO THE SOUP GUY.

26:30.760 --> 26:33.092
SHE'S LOOKING GOOD.
LOOKING CONFIDENT.

26:33.092 --> 26:34.624
(Alex) AND SHE BAILS.

26:34.624 --> 26:35.695
NO SOUP FOR HOLLY.

26:35.695 --> 26:36.826
(Lexie)
SHE LOOKS TERRIFIED.

26:36.826 --> 26:37.767
WHY ARE YOU SO MEAN?

26:37.767 --> 26:39.128
WOULD YOU JUST GO
BUY HER SOME SOUP?

26:39.128 --> 26:40.599
NO, IT'S NOT MEAN.

26:40.599 --> 26:41.931
SHE'S GOING HOME SOON,
AND DR. FINCHER SAYS,

26:41.931 --> 26:44.133
SHE HAS TO LEARN
TO DO THINGS FOR HERSELF.

26:44.133 --> 26:45.304
MM. AND YOU'RE GONNA FINALLY

26:45.304 --> 26:46.836

26:48.607 --> 26:50.810
REALLY?
(April) WELL, WHEREVER YOU GO,

26:50.810 --> 26:52.111
JUST BEWARE, THEY MAY JUDGE YOU
MORE ON YOUR PERSONALITY

26:52.111 --> 26:54.644
THAN WHAT REALLY MATTERS,
LIKE YOUR RESUME.

26:54.644 --> 26:56.916

THOSE PROGRAMS CAN SUCK IT.

27:05.955 --> 27:07.827
I'M TIRED OF TRYING SO HARD
NOT TO BE ME.

27:07.827 --> 27:08.958
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I LIKE ME.

27:08.958 --> 27:10.800
THAT MAKES ONE OF US.

27:10.800 --> 27:12.902
YOU MAKE IT SO EASY.
(snorts)

27:12.902 --> 27:14.063
LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
NOT BE YOU.

27:14.063 --> 27:15.234
JUST BE A LITTLE LESS YOU.
THAT'S ALL.

27:15.234 --> 27:16.405

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

27:16.405 --> 27:17.867
CLAIRE HIATT JUST CALLED

CALL HER BACK, APOLOGIZE.

27:20.940 --> 27:23.943

28:18.027 --> 28:19.869
WELL, JUST A LITTLE OUTSIDE.

28:19.869 --> 28:21.901
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED ME.

28:21.901 --> 28:22.902
OF COURSE I DO,

28:22.902 --> 28:24.233
THAT'S WHY
I'VE SPENT TONS OF TIME

28:24.233 --> 28:25.905
TURNING YOU

I KNOW. IT'S AWFUL.
I FEEL REALLY GUILTY ABOUT IT.

28:35.184 --> 28:37.887
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW HARD IT
IS TO FIND A GOOD PEDS FELLOW,

28:37.887 --> 28:39.789

WHO HAVEN'T BEEN THROUGH
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH.

29:16.285 --> 29:18.828
WHY DO YOU DO THAT,

29:18.828 --> 29:20.129
TALK AROUND IT?

29:20.129 --> 29:22.892
THE THERAPIST
AND MY PARENTS AND...

29:22.892 --> 29:25.835
WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH
IS BEING...

29:25.835 --> 29:29.338
KICKED AND RAPED
AND SLAPPED AND STARVED.

29:29.338 --> 29:31.400
AND I MEAN, I GET IT, BUT...

29:31.400 --> 29:33.973
IT WAS MY LIFE.

29:33.973 --> 29:35.975
AND I DIDN'T
GET TO TALK TO HIM

29:35.975 --> 29:38.077
ABOUT MY LIFE WITH MY PARENTS,

29:38.077 --> 29:42.081
AND NOW I DON'T GET TO TALK
TO ANYONE ABOUT HIM.

29:42.081 --> 29:44.413
BUT YOU CAN TALK
ABOUT HIM.

29:44.413 --> 29:46.055
NO, I CAN'T.

29:46.055 --> 29:48.487
NO, YOU'LL--YOU'LL THINK...

29:49.989 --> 29:51.360
YOU WON'T GET IT.

TRY ME.

29:57.166 --> 29:59.869
HE WASN'T ONLY BAD.

29:59.869 --> 30:02.031
SOMETIMES HE WAS OKAY.

30:02.031 --> 30:05.134
HE'D LET ME GO UPSTAIRS
AND...

30:05.134 --> 30:08.037
WE'D WATCH STUFF TOGETHER--

30:08.037 --> 30:10.209
MOVIES.

30:10.209 --> 30:13.112
AND IT WAS LIKE
IT WAS NORMAL.

30:13.112 --> 30:14.413
WHEN I CAME BACK HERE,
I TURNED ON THE TV,

30:14.413 --> 30:16.916
AND THERE WAS THIS...

30:16.916 --> 30:21.090
MOVIE ON
THAT WE WATCHED TOGETHER.

30:21.090 --> 30:23.392
AND I STARTED TO MISS HIM.

30:24.954 --> 30:27.826
AND I KNOW THAT'S BAD,
AND I MUST BE SICK.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.899
AND DON'T TELL THE SHRINK
THAT I SAID ANYTHING,

30:29.899 --> 30:31.060

30:31.060 --> 30:33.032
SHE'S GONNA ASK ME
HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT.

30:33.032 --> 30:35.935

30:38.007 --> 30:39.508

I SHOULD BE HAPPY THAT
I'M HERE AND NOT THERE.

BUT SOMETIMES I'M NOT.

30:47.917 --> 30:49.118
THAT'S OKAY.

30:50.479 --> 30:53.052
HOWEVER YOU FEEL IS OKAY.

30:57.026 --> 30:59.588
THEY'VE CALLED THREE TIMES
