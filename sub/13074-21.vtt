20:40.172 --> 20:42.507
One leg at a time!

20:42.574 --> 20:45.711
<i>[tense music]</i>

20:45.777 --> 20:48.981
- I love it!
Tara, you win.

20:49.047 --> 20:51.450
{\an3}- What--me?
I won?

20:51.516 --> 20:53.585
- I mean, you are crazy girl,

20:53.652 --> 20:55.887
but hey,
all the best ones are.

20:55.954 --> 20:57.489
You harnessed your crazy

20:57.556 --> 20:59.625
and made something pretty
out of it.

20:59.691 --> 21:03.495
Plus, I think your
"one leg at a time" attitude

21:03.562 --> 21:05.697
will help me
make the perfect wigs

21:05.764 --> 21:09.501
for my new book,
"One Wig at a Time."

21:09.568 --> 21:13.005
- Wow, I'm--I'm touched.

21:13.071 --> 21:17.242
I'd be honored.
Wow!

21:17.309 --> 21:19.244
[scissors snipping]

21:19.311 --> 21:22.514
And...ta-da!

21:22.581 --> 21:25.751
{\an1}- Oh, now this--
this is a quality haircut.

21:25.817 --> 21:27.653
{\an1}You know what,
I'm just gonna go ahead

21:27.719 --> 21:30.288
{\an1}and remove all those negative
comments that I put online.

21:30.355 --> 21:33.125
{\an1}Boop!

21:33.191 --> 21:35.260
- Hey, hair people!

21:35.327 --> 21:36.795
Jackie's back.

21:36.862 --> 21:40.666
{\an1}I've come for my wig.
[laughs]

21:40.732 --> 21:44.269
- One new amazing hairstyle
coming right up, Jackie.

21:44.336 --> 21:46.405
Well, what do you think?

21:46.471 --> 21:48.206
- Hmm.

21:48.273 --> 21:50.108
I love it!

21:50.175 --> 21:51.977
Let the music play!

21:52.044 --> 21:53.512
[exciting chatter]

21:53.578 --> 21:56.314
- Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
- Whoo!

21:56.381 --> 21:59.384
- What can I say?
I love hair!
