00:17.527 --> 00:19.761
(muffled grunting)

00:32.560 --> 00:34.756
(Jane) What is this place?

00:34.811 --> 00:36.489
Why'd you bring me here?

00:38.412 --> 00:41.412
40 years ago you had to
make a pretty decent living

00:41.447 --> 00:43.736
to afford a place on this lake.

00:43.810 --> 00:45.990
But then people started getting sick.

00:46.025 --> 00:48.961
Cancer, sterility, birth defects.

00:48.996 --> 00:52.382
Turns out a chemical plant up
river had been leaking for years.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.085
They'd known about it
the whole time, of course,

00:54.120 --> 00:57.095
but it was cheaper to up
their campaign contributions

00:57.169 --> 00:59.158
than to repair the damage.

00:59.219 --> 01:01.808
So the people elected to protect us

01:01.845 --> 01:03.360
looked the other way as...

01:03.426 --> 01:05.623
thousand of families were destroyed.

01:06.310 --> 01:06.812
I don't...

01:06.847 --> 01:09.057
Lake Aurora should mean something.

01:09.112 --> 01:11.848
But betrayals like these are so common now,

01:11.895 --> 01:14.275
they don't even make the news.

01:14.345 --> 01:17.869
I brought you here because I
need you to get angry again.

01:17.948 --> 01:20.586
I know our methods might
seem barbaric, but this...

01:20.621 --> 01:22.643
this is what we're fighting against.

01:22.678 --> 01:25.398
We're not attacking this country.

01:25.433 --> 01:27.160
We're defending it.

01:27.195 --> 01:30.454
What, exactly, is Shepherd planning?

01:33.220 --> 01:36.374
You're gonna make people very
nervous with questions like that.

01:38.105 --> 01:39.659
We should get back.

01:43.603 --> 01:45.806
Do you have any idea how many
children Jones could have hurt

01:45.856 --> 01:48.047
over the past two decades?

01:48.121 --> 01:50.020
(machine beeps)

01:50.077 --> 01:53.335
We're having trouble getting
victims to come in and testify.

01:53.376 --> 01:54.859
(machine beeps)

01:55.058 --> 01:57.276
We'll get him. I promise.

01:57.346 --> 01:58.708
(machine beeps)

01:58.743 --> 01:59.840
What do you mean you're
not bringing the case?

01:59.887 --> 02:01.760
Jones's lawyers would tear him apart.

02:01.807 --> 02:03.323
(machine beeps)

02:03.386 --> 02:05.589
- You don't remember.
- (Reade panting)

02:05.628 --> 02:07.209
Remember what, Freddy?

02:07.244 --> 02:09.656
- (Freddy) You were there.
- (panting)

02:09.711 --> 02:12.046
(motor whirring down)

02:17.341 --> 02:19.277
Sorry, I, uh,

02:19.312 --> 02:21.346
I didn't realize you couldn't have coffee.

02:21.381 --> 02:23.348
- Kurt...
- I've got some decaf.

02:23.383 --> 02:25.089
Kurt, forget about the coffee.

02:25.124 --> 02:25.976
Come on, what's up?

02:26.011 --> 02:27.823
Sorry, I, um...

02:27.877 --> 02:29.109
(clears throat)

02:30.311 --> 02:34.260
I don't think I've been
handling this very well.

02:34.295 --> 02:37.019
- That's because you haven't.
- (chuckling)

02:37.092 --> 02:38.787
Every time I think about it, I...

02:38.849 --> 02:41.634
I get, like, a pit in my stomach.

02:41.669 --> 02:43.326
You get a pit in your stomach?

02:43.361 --> 02:46.214
I have someone growing inside me.

02:46.249 --> 02:47.753
And they're gonna keep growing.

02:47.788 --> 02:49.322
They're probably gonna
be bigger than me one day,

02:49.357 --> 02:50.811
and they're gonna listen to horrible music.

02:50.855 --> 02:52.290
And they're never gonna
listen to me when I tell them

02:52.325 --> 02:54.337
not to sleep with their science
teacher because what do I know?

02:54.372 --> 02:56.160
I couldn't even figure out birth control.

02:56.212 --> 02:59.234
Allie... I'm in.

03:00.951 --> 03:02.308
Huh?

03:02.497 --> 03:04.053
I'm in.

03:04.915 --> 03:07.178
Okay.

03:07.233 --> 03:09.811
Okay, that's, um...

03:09.886 --> 03:12.746
This... this is good. Come here.

03:13.990 --> 03:15.708
(chuckling)

03:15.743 --> 03:17.245
(giggling)

03:17.280 --> 03:18.688
(knocking on door)

03:18.723 --> 03:20.274
Freddy... hey.

03:20.336 --> 03:23.009
Sorry to just show up like this.

03:23.044 --> 03:23.876
My phone's still...

03:23.911 --> 03:26.486
No, no, that's why I gave you my address.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.485
Everything okay?

03:27.520 --> 03:29.114
I hate to ask this, but, uh,

03:29.171 --> 03:31.199
you think I could crash here for a bit?

03:31.234 --> 03:32.926
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

03:33.002 --> 03:35.658
Just had a few... drinks.

03:35.693 --> 03:37.495
Girlfriend freaked out.

03:38.342 --> 03:39.573
I mean, if it's too much trouble...

03:39.608 --> 03:41.892
No, no, of course, man. Come on in.

03:46.838 --> 03:48.723
This place is nice, man.

03:48.758 --> 03:50.250
You need me to get you some help?

03:50.297 --> 03:53.790
- Call somebody? Your girlfriend?
- I'm gonna go to a meeting.

03:53.825 --> 03:54.784
I just...

03:54.838 --> 03:57.412
All this Coach Jones
stuff has got me all...

03:58.680 --> 04:01.483
I'm gonna go to a meeting. I promise.

04:01.518 --> 04:03.447
And I appreciate the help.

04:04.451 --> 04:06.100
You're a good friend, man.

04:11.295 --> 04:12.217
(Weller) I don't buy it.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.024
Buy what? Roman's motives
seem pretty clear to me.

04:15.059 --> 04:18.259
What, he hauls Jane halfway to Canada
because he wants her to get angry?

04:18.293 --> 04:19.307
Yeah, why not?

04:19.387 --> 04:21.814
Visual propaganda is an
extremely powerful tool.

04:21.849 --> 04:23.454
If he wants to show her a polluted lake,

04:23.489 --> 04:24.965
there's some a lot closer to Manhattan.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.427
From Sandstorm's point of view,

04:26.462 --> 04:29.150
Jane's been brainwashed
by her exposure to the FBI.

04:29.185 --> 04:32.805
You guys know I'm standing in this
room with you right now, right?

04:32.874 --> 04:36.617
I looked up what happened there.
Roman was telling the truth.

04:36.652 --> 04:39.422
A poison lake that tore
apart hundreds of families,

04:39.457 --> 04:41.293
while the government
watched and did nothing,

04:41.352 --> 04:43.958
is not "visual propaganda."

04:44.035 --> 04:45.921
It's an outrage.

04:52.006 --> 04:53.715
I'm just saying none of this is your fault.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.265
You don't owe him anything.

04:55.313 --> 04:56.530
He needed a couch, I got a couch.

04:56.587 --> 04:58.515
What's a day gonna hurt? What?

04:58.566 --> 05:01.004
It's not gonna be a day, and you know it.

05:01.039 --> 05:05.240
So, we all know that the honeycomb
pattern on Jane's right hand

05:05.298 --> 05:07.949
is made up of two subtly
different shades of ink.

05:07.984 --> 05:11.034
Last night I was teaching
my Girls Who Code students

05:11.069 --> 05:14.538
when I started to think
about what these two shades

05:14.573 --> 05:15.685
would look like to a computer.

05:15.720 --> 05:19.511
- Ones and zeroes.
- Yes, Girl Who Codes.

05:19.546 --> 05:21.655
When you follow the pattern of each shade,

05:21.690 --> 05:23.957
it snakes its way around the tattoo.

05:24.004 --> 05:27.810
If you count every left turn as a
one and every right turn as a zero,

05:27.862 --> 05:30.472
it translates into two
correlating messages.

05:30.507 --> 05:32.885
And the first one translates to...

05:32.930 --> 05:35.261
3216-219.

05:35.317 --> 05:37.695
So the numbers translate into more numbers.

05:37.730 --> 05:39.030
That's not just any number.

05:39.085 --> 05:40.990
That's a Homeland Security employee ID.

05:41.045 --> 05:43.694
For analyst Bo Kaier, to be exact.

05:43.739 --> 05:46.184
Office of Infrastructure Protection.

05:46.219 --> 05:47.815
You said two correlating messages.

05:47.863 --> 05:51.411
Yeah, well, if you follow the second line

05:51.455 --> 05:55.297
on the honeycomb pattern,
it translates to "Shadowcat."

05:55.332 --> 05:58.923
Wait, this Kaier guy is the Shadowcat?

05:58.969 --> 06:00.353
Somebody wanna fill me in?

06:00.408 --> 06:02.277
Online handle for a hacker on the Dark Web.

06:02.312 --> 06:04.392
He reached the White House
servers, naval intelligence,

06:04.442 --> 06:06.212
even the Pentagon's internal networks.

06:06.247 --> 06:08.595
So someone responsible for
protecting our infrastructure

06:08.649 --> 06:10.396
was using their position to undermine it.

06:10.431 --> 06:12.971
- Let's bring him in.
- I'll get you an expedited warrant.

06:14.481 --> 06:15.764
(tires screech)

06:20.111 --> 06:21.358
Reade, go around the back.

06:21.393 --> 06:22.251
On it!

06:31.749 --> 06:32.560
(explosions popping)

06:32.595 --> 06:33.536
I found the servers.

06:33.571 --> 06:35.972
He's using thermite to
destroy the hard drives.

06:41.347 --> 06:42.746
Suspect is armed.

06:45.469 --> 06:47.788
Coming to you, Reade.
Save those hard drives!

06:47.827 --> 06:48.639
- Copy.
- Copy.

06:48.674 --> 06:50.724
(zapping)

06:53.378 --> 06:54.461
Uhh!

06:55.512 --> 06:56.545
(gunshot)

06:58.221 --> 07:00.071
(both grunting)

07:05.347 --> 07:07.220
Reade. Reade!

07:07.307 --> 07:08.944
- Reade!
- Uhh!

07:08.979 --> 07:11.136
Reade, enough of that! Enough!

07:11.202 --> 07:12.329
Enough!

07:15.033 --> 07:17.137
Turn over. Turn over!

07:17.207 --> 07:18.833
Put your hands behind your back.

07:18.926 --> 07:21.272
Bo Kaier, you're under arrest.

07:21.307 --> 07:23.970
Get on your knees and stand up.

07:24.043 --> 07:25.189
Walk.

07:31.959 --> 07:33.762
(Patterson) Thanks to Jane and Zapata,

07:33.797 --> 07:36.613
these hard drives were
more singed than slagged.

07:36.668 --> 07:39.600
I was able to access a good portion
of Shadowcat's main database.

07:39.639 --> 07:41.899
What's this? His video game collection?

07:41.969 --> 07:42.672
(Patterson) Yes and no.

07:42.717 --> 07:44.614
Kaier has modified commercial video games

07:44.660 --> 07:47.684
to simulate some of the most
secure buildings in the country.

07:47.719 --> 07:51.357
The "objective" in each
mod is to heist something.

07:51.392 --> 07:55.079
Ebola vaccines, nuclear
materials, weapon prototypes.

07:55.114 --> 07:56.297
(Reade) This is the CDC in Atlanta.

07:56.370 --> 07:57.789
There was a robbery there last year.

07:57.824 --> 07:59.463
Thousands of Ebola vaccines were stolen.

07:59.518 --> 08:01.887
So Kaier's recreating heists.

08:01.949 --> 08:06.180
No, this file was created
before the crime happened.

08:06.217 --> 08:08.392
So the game is a training
simulator for robberies.

08:08.443 --> 08:11.169
Exactly... Kaier's using
his classified access

08:11.224 --> 08:12.788
to obtain security measures,

08:12.834 --> 08:17.338
then selling off these foolproof
plans disguised as playable mods.

08:17.373 --> 08:19.722
But how much can a video
game really teach you?

08:19.786 --> 08:22.154
I mean, that's actually a
very controversial question.

08:22.189 --> 08:24.506
'Cause a lot of people would argue
that video games are actually...

08:24.563 --> 08:27.170
The mods are insanely detailed.

08:27.205 --> 08:29.115
Number of guards and their weapons,

08:29.171 --> 08:30.974
security cameras, locked doors,

08:31.028 --> 08:32.558
police response and procedures.

08:32.610 --> 08:35.337
Right. So that's why none of
the teams were ever caught.

08:35.371 --> 08:37.207
The body counts might have had
something to do with it, too.

08:37.258 --> 08:40.294
Yeah, four dead at the CDC.
Three at a gallery in Miami.

08:40.328 --> 08:41.621
Six at Monera-Gen.

08:41.667 --> 08:43.799
So Kaier's got a lot of blood on his hands.

08:43.869 --> 08:45.051
And he could have a lot more.

08:45.100 --> 08:48.395
We found some new mods, too,
all located in different cities.

08:48.430 --> 08:49.715
Heists that haven't happened yet.

08:49.754 --> 08:50.663
Dozens of 'em.

08:50.698 --> 08:52.314
We don't know when or where.

08:52.377 --> 08:54.454
We're still uncovering the
data from the damaged drives.

08:54.493 --> 08:55.594
(Weller) We better find out.

08:55.629 --> 08:57.800
Otherwise, the body count's
gonna be a lot higher.

08:58.866 --> 09:01.616
♪♪

09:04.096 --> 09:09.096
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull
www.addic7ed.com

09:15.364 --> 09:18.133
Patterson and Zapata have
cracked a couple of the mods.

09:18.168 --> 09:20.574
But, can we quickly
talk about Reade, please?

09:20.609 --> 09:21.894
The guy had a gun.

09:21.951 --> 09:23.530
Reade did what he had
to do to make the arrest.

09:23.571 --> 09:25.854
He broke a suspect's orbital bone.

09:25.892 --> 09:27.989
Something is going on with your agent.

09:28.024 --> 09:29.024
He should sit this one out.

09:29.059 --> 09:30.524
No. He shouldn't.

09:30.569 --> 09:32.802
That is my team, and
that is my call to make.

09:32.837 --> 09:34.925
So make it.

09:35.043 --> 09:36.916
Let's go and see what Patterson's got.

09:40.445 --> 09:42.844
We're still recovering fragments
from Kaier's hard drives,

09:42.879 --> 09:46.239
but I was able to extract
the last plan Shadowcat sold.

09:46.292 --> 09:48.130
Looks like a heist plan for New York.

09:48.206 --> 09:51.800
Judging from the partial maps and
antiquities appearing in the game,

09:51.848 --> 09:54.640
I'm pretty sure it's
the Aebly Museum of Art.

09:54.684 --> 09:56.373
Any idea what they're targeting?

09:56.437 --> 09:58.335
Unclear, but we've narrowed down the when.

09:58.370 --> 10:01.323
The game showcases wait
staff serving drinks.

10:01.358 --> 10:03.133
They only do this during museum events.

10:03.180 --> 10:05.295
- So, when's the next event?
- It's two days from now.

10:05.330 --> 10:07.968
Fundraising gala. Guest
list is over 200 people.

10:08.014 --> 10:09.609
The museum changes exhibits next week.

10:09.644 --> 10:12.301
It's a good time to steal something
before it moves on to the next city.

10:12.359 --> 10:15.144
And the security roster during
daytime events is a lot lighter.

10:15.217 --> 10:18.326
Well, the party'll give the
thieves plenty of ways to blend in.

10:18.361 --> 10:19.953
Then we do the same.

10:20.079 --> 10:21.706
We go into this event undercover.

10:21.766 --> 10:23.974
If the heist crew shows up,
we're there to stop them.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.921
I'll recover what I can from the mod,

10:25.984 --> 10:28.641
see if I can get a clearer
picture of what they're after.

10:28.720 --> 10:29.806
Good.

10:33.979 --> 10:35.686
Reade. Can I talk to you for a second?

10:35.721 --> 10:37.265
The guy clocked me in the
face. I was defending myself.

10:37.331 --> 10:38.854
Forget it... is there something else

10:38.912 --> 10:40.779
going on with you that I should know about?

10:40.819 --> 10:42.369
Like what?

10:42.423 --> 10:43.671
I'm just sayin'.

10:43.744 --> 10:44.470
If you wanna take a few days...

10:44.505 --> 10:46.183
I'm good, really.

10:47.536 --> 10:49.223
All right.

10:49.266 --> 10:51.614
I'm gonna hold you to
that. (pats his shoulder)

10:52.797 --> 10:55.743
_

10:59.115 --> 11:01.030
(approaching footsteps)

11:01.069 --> 11:03.073
Do you need a hand?

11:03.108 --> 11:05.126
Uh... sure.

11:09.747 --> 11:12.509
There you go. All set.

11:12.544 --> 11:13.792
Thank you.

11:14.455 --> 11:16.182
We're gonna need these.

11:16.291 --> 11:19.607
Oh, heh. Are we playing
a married couple again?

11:20.566 --> 11:22.621
No.

11:22.700 --> 11:24.806
Inner ear comms.

11:24.975 --> 11:28.293
So that we don't tip anyone
off we're crashing the party.

11:29.959 --> 11:31.008
Thanks.

11:38.744 --> 11:41.578
(soft classical music)

11:42.816 --> 11:45.442
Museum security has been put on alert.

11:45.477 --> 11:46.964
Got a lot of ground to cover.

11:46.999 --> 11:49.664
Naz and Patterson,
you're on the first floor.

11:49.699 --> 11:51.961
Jane's on second with me.

11:52.016 --> 11:55.349
Reade, Tasha, start on the top floor.

11:55.384 --> 11:56.791
Work your way down.

11:56.869 --> 11:58.546
Sucks for you two.

11:58.581 --> 12:01.250
You're gonna miss the
Alexander Calder exhibit.

12:01.285 --> 12:03.340
I'm sure you'll tell us all about it.

12:03.375 --> 12:05.368
We're not here for the art.

12:05.403 --> 12:09.400
So, everyone, keep your eyes peeled
for something or someone suspicious.

12:09.454 --> 12:12.047
(son clinking on glass)

12:12.082 --> 12:14.706
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you all for coming.

12:14.770 --> 12:17.484
Every penny we raise tonight goes
directly to clean water initiatives

12:17.531 --> 12:19.088
all over the world.

12:19.130 --> 12:20.925
Even some right here in our backyard.

12:20.975 --> 12:22.418
So grab another drink.

12:22.487 --> 12:24.395
Get ready to donate way
more than you should.

12:24.452 --> 12:27.169
(crowd chattering)

12:31.405 --> 12:33.077
_

12:34.177 --> 12:36.516
(Zapata) Possible suspect. Male, 30s.

12:36.572 --> 12:39.121
Headed to a closed exhibit on the west end.

12:39.166 --> 12:40.594
Headed your way.

12:48.566 --> 12:50.559
(Zapata) The exhibit's closed.

12:50.594 --> 12:51.865
Get out!

12:51.912 --> 12:53.261
- (Reade) Let's go.
- Move.

12:53.299 --> 12:54.880
False alarm, Weller.

12:54.935 --> 12:55.750
(Weller) Copy.

12:55.785 --> 12:57.481
Stay on them, just in case.

12:57.564 --> 12:58.712
(Zapata) Copy.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.078
Haven't seen you at these events before.

13:05.164 --> 13:06.473
It's my first one.

13:06.508 --> 13:08.866
Well, let me be the first to say welcome.

13:08.910 --> 13:10.707
- Oliver Kind.
- Jane.

13:10.742 --> 13:11.839
So, are you here with someone?

13:11.874 --> 13:14.553
Or just happen to have a passion
for fine art and potable water?

13:14.588 --> 13:16.471
Uh, kind of all three.

13:17.331 --> 13:19.205
Well, if there's anything you'd
like to know about the exhibit,

13:19.240 --> 13:20.661
or the clean water initiative,

13:20.696 --> 13:22.664
or which bartender here
makes the best martini,

13:22.730 --> 13:23.839
just let me know.

13:25.832 --> 13:28.243
Actually, I do have a question.

13:28.278 --> 13:29.486
What are you doing, Jane?

13:29.541 --> 13:30.297
Just keep moving.

13:30.332 --> 13:32.462
I, uh... I've been

13:32.526 --> 13:35.042
doing some reading on Lake Aurora.

13:35.111 --> 13:37.243
The BLC chemical leak back in the '60s.

13:37.306 --> 13:40.222
Yeah. Was it really as bad as they say?

13:40.276 --> 13:43.335
No. No, from what I
remember, it was much worse.

13:43.391 --> 13:45.177
That contamination happened 50 years ago

13:45.233 --> 13:47.101
and the region's still
struggling to recover.

13:47.136 --> 13:48.757
Mm, that's awful.

13:48.817 --> 13:51.479
Well, lucky we're not learning
anything from our mistakes.

13:53.077 --> 13:53.988
That was a joke.

13:54.057 --> 13:56.381
Oh... I know.

13:57.208 --> 14:00.097
So... why were you reading about Aurora?

14:00.194 --> 14:02.361
(Weller) Ahem, sorry to interrupt.

14:02.444 --> 14:03.618
Um, Jane.

14:03.653 --> 14:06.114
There's someone in the Aztec
Room I'd love you to meet.

14:06.149 --> 14:08.356
Hi, Oliver Kind.

14:09.445 --> 14:11.492
Very good.

14:11.555 --> 14:12.778
Let's go.

14:14.881 --> 14:17.016
My brother isn't great with people.

14:17.232 --> 14:18.440
Right.

14:18.493 --> 14:19.382
It was nice meeting you.

14:19.432 --> 14:22.230
Well, why don't we pick this up later?

14:29.457 --> 14:31.049
What was that about?

14:31.084 --> 14:32.410
Blending in.

14:32.516 --> 14:34.683
Just focus on this mission.

14:37.013 --> 14:38.045
(beeping)

14:39.642 --> 14:40.873
_

14:42.552 --> 14:46.458
Hey, my techs just recovered
more parts of the museum mod.

14:46.513 --> 14:48.529
The basement's integrated
into the game, too,

14:48.564 --> 14:50.372
not just exhibit floors like I thought.

14:50.407 --> 14:53.022
Maybe they're after something in storage.

14:53.057 --> 14:53.992
I'm gonna check it out.

14:54.038 --> 14:55.599
(Weller) We'll meet you down there.

15:14.179 --> 15:15.722
Hey, I'm in the basement.

15:15.757 --> 15:18.358
I'll hold the floor until we
can get security down here.

15:21.225 --> 15:24.176
(gagging and grunting)

15:30.520 --> 15:31.883
(Weller) FBI!

15:32.018 --> 15:33.260
Put her down!

15:35.270 --> 15:36.860
- Patterson... Hey, hey!
- (coughing)

15:36.916 --> 15:38.696
- You okay?
- Yeah. Go.

15:38.760 --> 15:40.076
Go, go, go, go, go.

15:43.614 --> 15:45.714
Suspect is heading up the west stairwell.

15:48.648 --> 15:51.089
Suspect is a black female
wearing a black dress.

15:51.152 --> 15:52.614
Short brown hair.

15:52.706 --> 15:54.429
She's gone back in the museum.

16:07.262 --> 16:10.275
Naz, get museum security
to lock down every exit.

16:10.313 --> 16:12.449
She could be on the run
now that she's been made.

16:12.527 --> 16:13.859
(Naz) On it.

16:13.936 --> 16:14.812
Damn.

16:14.847 --> 16:17.713
I want everyone to search for anyone
that's matching that description.

16:17.748 --> 16:19.775
Or any accomplices that
could be helping her.

16:19.864 --> 16:20.547
(Naz) Copy that.

16:20.587 --> 16:21.976
- Copy.
- Copy.

16:25.593 --> 16:27.582
(Patterson) I'm in the security office.

16:27.702 --> 16:28.704
Trying to find her on the cameras,

16:28.745 --> 16:32.546
but woman in a black dress doesn't
exactly set her apart from this crowd.

16:32.600 --> 16:33.966
Keep me updated.

16:38.440 --> 16:41.061
We've got a body. Female,
late 30s. Southeast wing.

16:41.131 --> 16:42.601
Okay, change of plans.

16:42.663 --> 16:44.659
Start moving the guests into secure rooms.

16:44.740 --> 16:45.764
Use the guards.

16:45.827 --> 16:47.215
- Do it now.
- On it.

16:47.278 --> 16:49.242
We need to get these
people to a secure location.

16:49.277 --> 16:50.320
Okay, right away.

16:50.401 --> 16:51.373
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:51.449 --> 16:52.948
please stay calm and follow me.

16:56.773 --> 16:57.699
Any luck, Patterson?

16:57.773 --> 16:59.019
No... (coughing)

16:59.054 --> 17:01.150
She must have been
using a camera scrambler.

17:01.220 --> 17:03.904
All of the feeds around the
stairwell went out before she exited.

17:03.962 --> 17:05.877
(Weller) No sign of her anywhere else?

17:05.912 --> 17:08.685
Shadowcat's mod must have taught her
every place the cameras don't see.

17:08.756 --> 17:10.060
I got nothing.

17:11.051 --> 17:13.393
Wait, she's using the scrambler again.

17:13.469 --> 17:16.119
She's headed to the Eye of
Man exhibit, second floor.

17:16.157 --> 17:17.324
(Reade) Headed there now.

17:18.192 --> 17:19.784
(Zapata) There, up ahead.

17:19.834 --> 17:21.625
Black female, short brown hair.

17:21.952 --> 17:24.020
- FBI!
- Hands where I can see them!

17:24.074 --> 17:24.874
- Don't move.
- What's going on?

17:24.940 --> 17:26.189
Don't move!

17:29.580 --> 17:31.005
(Zapata) She's clean.

17:32.853 --> 17:33.775
(Zapata) He had a scrambler.

17:33.810 --> 17:35.042
(man) That is not mine!

17:35.219 --> 17:36.868
- Turn around.
- Don't move.

17:37.108 --> 17:38.189
Do you have any weapons on you?

17:38.255 --> 17:39.657
- No!
- Reade.

17:40.144 --> 17:41.847
Do you have any weapons on you?

17:41.882 --> 17:42.804
That's enough!

17:42.840 --> 17:44.202
I saw this couple a half-hour ago, okay?

17:44.264 --> 17:46.152
They're clean. Weller...

17:46.187 --> 17:47.712
she must have planted
the scrambler on a guest

17:47.786 --> 17:49.670
to lure us in another direction.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.146
Take him downstairs. I'm
gonna continue searching.

17:54.088 --> 17:55.885
Who the hell is this woman?

17:56.718 --> 17:59.309
You don't have to do this. Let's talk.

17:59.386 --> 18:01.648
Please. I can make this right.

18:01.729 --> 18:02.711
It's too late for that.

18:02.814 --> 18:04.180
(grunting)

18:15.993 --> 18:17.510
(door handle rattles)

18:28.607 --> 18:30.082
Another victim.

18:30.206 --> 18:33.122
I'm evacuating the building
and calling in NYPD.

18:37.830 --> 18:39.264
I've got eyes on her.

18:39.300 --> 18:41.949
She's going into the photography
exhibit on the southeast wing.

18:52.749 --> 18:53.790
She's not here.

18:53.835 --> 18:55.234
There's no other exits.

18:55.306 --> 18:56.455
Where'd she go?

18:58.234 --> 18:59.488
(beeping)

18:59.543 --> 19:00.656
Uh, wait.

19:00.658 --> 19:04.822
The game mod shows that there's an
exit through a sign on the east wall.

19:13.831 --> 19:16.665
It's a dumbwaiter.
Which room does it go to?

19:17.876 --> 19:19.993
Uh, right up to the Asian Art wing.

19:25.306 --> 19:26.706
I'm there now.

19:40.242 --> 19:41.992
(both grunting)

19:49.722 --> 19:50.788
Uhh!

20:02.012 --> 20:03.061
Uhh!

20:16.679 --> 20:19.598
♪♪

20:19.692 --> 20:21.365
Jane. You okay?

20:21.443 --> 20:23.699
I'm okay. It was just a flash-bang.

20:23.803 --> 20:25.776
- Come on. Come on.
- (grunting)

20:25.852 --> 20:27.038
(Weller) Team, let's have a lockdown

20:27.073 --> 20:28.750
on the west end of the building... now.

20:28.814 --> 20:30.551
I think it's too late for that.

20:35.168 --> 20:36.576
She's gone.

20:42.074 --> 20:45.524
We pulled DNA from the oxygen
mask and also found a partial print

20:45.576 --> 20:48.210
on an artifact the suspect
used to attack Jane.

20:48.245 --> 20:50.155
The system's looking
for a match as we speak.

20:50.190 --> 20:51.439
Do we know where she came from?

20:51.474 --> 20:53.732
The sarcophagus is part
of an upcoming exhibit

20:53.790 --> 20:56.057
on loan from the Coptic Museum in Cairo.

20:56.119 --> 20:57.462
The day before it was shipped,

20:57.525 --> 20:59.510
Egyptian customs reported a break-in.

20:59.512 --> 21:01.730
The guard was drugged and left unconscious.

21:01.816 --> 21:03.360
And no one there flagged it?

21:03.405 --> 21:05.754
They did a security check,
and it came up empty.

21:05.807 --> 21:06.970
Nothing went missing.

21:07.040 --> 21:10.625
Who's gonna think to look inside a
4,000-year-old coffin for a stowaway?

21:10.690 --> 21:14.120
That woman specifically
targeted this gala. Why?

21:14.155 --> 21:15.787
I've ID'd the two victims.

21:15.828 --> 21:18.103
This is Bridget Taylor, and Michael Murphy,

21:18.173 --> 21:20.364
an art scholar and a restaurateur,

21:20.366 --> 21:22.714
both with ties to East Africa.

21:22.749 --> 21:24.796
So the game mod wasn't
a blueprint for a heist.

21:24.849 --> 21:25.644
It was for a hit.

21:25.679 --> 21:26.687
And she might not be done yet.

21:26.771 --> 21:29.221
We might have forced her to
flee before she was finished.

21:29.269 --> 21:31.548
I'm IDing the guest list, trying to see

21:31.618 --> 21:34.110
if there are any more
connections to East Africa.

21:34.167 --> 21:35.955
Let me know as soon as you have something.

21:36.005 --> 21:37.495
Where's Reade?

21:39.084 --> 21:41.292
- You're suspending me?
- No.

21:41.332 --> 21:43.872
I just want you to talk to Borden
before you go back in the field.

21:43.921 --> 21:45.332
The guy a couple days ago had a gun.

21:45.367 --> 21:48.098
- He was resisting arrest.
- You broke his face, Reade.

21:48.575 --> 21:49.734
And Naz is telling me that you roughed up

21:49.791 --> 21:51.655
some old guy at the museum.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.765
Who's this order coming from, you or her?

21:55.155 --> 21:56.855
It's not a suspension.

21:58.121 --> 21:59.668
I'm just worried about you.

21:59.771 --> 22:01.737
That supposed to make me feel better?

22:04.004 --> 22:05.541
Talk to Borden.

22:14.419 --> 22:17.154
(engine rumbling)

22:24.405 --> 22:25.638
(door slams)

22:30.603 --> 22:32.931
(door creaks)

22:32.999 --> 22:33.976
_

22:35.434 --> 22:36.885
Where's the rest of it?

22:36.940 --> 22:38.207
This is only half of what we needed.

22:38.266 --> 22:39.575
The seller couldn't come up with the rest.

22:39.625 --> 22:41.057
That's unacceptable.

22:41.123 --> 22:43.657
Believe me. He got the message.

22:44.092 --> 22:46.526
We just have to postpone
until we can get the rest.

22:46.604 --> 22:48.410
No... we need to strike

22:48.412 --> 22:50.378
while they're still playing catch-up.

22:50.413 --> 22:52.782
I'll talk to some of our other suppliers.

22:52.840 --> 22:54.927
See what we can come up with.

22:55.719 --> 22:58.821
Why did you take your
sister to Lake Aurora?

22:58.914 --> 23:00.562
You're keeping tabs on me now?

23:00.647 --> 23:03.144
Stop giving me reasons to.

23:03.240 --> 23:05.388
I'm worried we're only
showing her the worst of us.

23:05.458 --> 23:07.310
That's not your call to make.

23:07.374 --> 23:08.793
She's forgotten you, forgotten me,

23:08.866 --> 23:11.702
forgotten why we're doing
this in the first place!

23:14.172 --> 23:17.658
I wanted to show her what she's
making all these sacrifices for.

23:17.829 --> 23:19.839
Where it all started.

23:19.933 --> 23:21.135
Did you tell her everything?

23:21.178 --> 23:23.600
No, but you need to.

23:23.742 --> 23:25.614
How can you expect her
to claw her way back here

23:25.616 --> 23:28.050
if she's got nothing to hold onto?

23:38.666 --> 23:39.695
What do you got?

23:40.087 --> 23:41.573
Aren't we gonna wait for Reade?

23:41.626 --> 23:43.197
No. What do you got?

23:43.263 --> 23:46.186
Uh... we got a hit on a partial print.

23:46.223 --> 23:47.459
(Zapata) That's definitely her.

23:47.511 --> 23:50.631
The suspect's name is Elizabeth Gubara.

23:50.666 --> 23:52.836
A Sudanese national with
ties to a terror group

23:52.902 --> 23:55.710
responsible for several
attacks from Kenya to Yemen.

23:55.754 --> 23:57.238
(Jane) Are they active in the US?

23:57.348 --> 23:59.148
(Naz) Not until now... Gubara is the first

23:59.183 --> 24:01.667
confirmed member of the
group to cross our borders.

24:01.719 --> 24:04.504
All right, have we got any
leads on other potential targets?

24:04.539 --> 24:08.147
Yes, Charles Kessler.
He was also at the gala.

24:08.181 --> 24:09.807
He's a State Department
suit who's been coordinating

24:09.842 --> 24:11.796
relief efforts throughout
the horn of Africa.

24:11.840 --> 24:15.205
So we cross-referenced his travel
history with the two victims.

24:15.252 --> 24:17.939
Several of his itineraries
line up perfectly with theirs.

24:17.990 --> 24:18.975
So they all knew each other.

24:19.037 --> 24:22.352
But the question is, what did they do
to end up in Elizabeth's crosshairs?

24:22.427 --> 24:23.540
Where is Kessler now?

24:23.593 --> 24:26.021
His phone's off and his office
doesn't know where he is.

24:26.070 --> 24:27.548
All I have is a home address.

24:27.600 --> 24:28.851
Keep trying to reach him.

24:28.913 --> 24:30.724
We gotta find him before Elizabeth does

24:30.807 --> 24:32.938
and we got another dead body on our hands.

24:44.944 --> 24:45.964
(Weller) FBI!

24:45.999 --> 24:48.694
Put your weapon down. Put it down!

24:48.729 --> 24:51.702
Completely surrounded.
And no other options.

24:51.780 --> 24:53.468
Put it down.

24:53.540 --> 24:54.930
Put it down!

25:00.064 --> 25:02.204
I checked the perimeter. She's alone.

25:02.290 --> 25:03.873
- Give me your hands.
- (handcuffs snapping)

25:03.908 --> 25:05.821
Was Kessler the last target?

25:06.389 --> 25:07.746
What's your cell's mission?

25:07.781 --> 25:10.315
These isolated attacks,
or part of a bigger plan?

25:11.292 --> 25:13.201
There is no cell.

25:14.502 --> 25:16.124
I'm CIA!

25:27.434 --> 25:30.691
♪♪

25:30.739 --> 25:33.351
Edgar, I understand that
you'd rather not be here,

25:33.402 --> 25:35.712
but Assistant Director Weller
has asked me to evaluate you

25:35.762 --> 25:38.017
before you resume active duty.

25:38.052 --> 25:40.421
I've got nothing to say.

25:40.489 --> 25:43.842
I was told that you broke a
suspect's orbital bone two days ago.

25:43.877 --> 25:45.621
How many times do I have to say this?

25:45.656 --> 25:47.392
He had a gun, and he was resisting arrest.

25:47.446 --> 25:49.418
I also looked over your record.

25:49.453 --> 25:53.118
You've never injured a suspect
in custody before, not once.

25:53.181 --> 25:54.315
And now, you've injured two.

25:54.350 --> 25:55.739
The old man got a couple of bruises.

25:55.812 --> 25:57.830
I hardly call that "injured."

25:58.266 --> 26:00.835
You asked me recently
about repressed memories.

26:00.870 --> 26:02.606
You said it was for a case.

26:03.139 --> 26:04.672
Was it?

26:07.076 --> 26:08.278
No.

26:08.318 --> 26:10.667
Have you recovered a memory of trauma?

26:18.753 --> 26:21.246
I've been trying to put together
a case against Coach Jones.

26:21.281 --> 26:23.798
The football coach from Hudson, hm.

26:23.833 --> 26:24.898
The one accused of...

26:24.933 --> 26:27.167
Yeah, I went to his camp as a kid.

26:30.104 --> 26:33.051
A friend of mine, Freddy,
was one of his victims.

26:36.157 --> 26:38.991
Freddy told me I was
one of his victims, too.

26:39.147 --> 26:41.113
But you don't remember?

26:41.175 --> 26:43.447
No.

26:43.542 --> 26:46.313
I remember pizza parties, practices...

26:48.284 --> 26:50.583
There's also some gaps there,

26:50.653 --> 26:52.789
big ones...

26:52.990 --> 26:54.803
where I don't remember much of anything.

26:54.850 --> 26:56.359
Well, childhood trauma can affect the way

26:56.447 --> 26:58.695
the brain stores memories.

26:58.866 --> 27:01.498
Young victims of abuse often cope

27:01.576 --> 27:04.367
by disassociating from the event.

27:04.422 --> 27:07.643
Which means that the memories
of the abuse are forgotten

27:07.740 --> 27:10.490
and often only recalled much later in life.

27:10.568 --> 27:12.038
But I don't recall them.

27:12.085 --> 27:14.177
But you do recall the gaps.

27:14.445 --> 27:16.825
Now, I can't help but think
that the fear and frustration

27:16.860 --> 27:20.382
of not knowing is precisely
what's causing these sudden,

27:20.491 --> 27:22.691
uncontrollable bouts of anger.

27:23.719 --> 27:25.756
I... I just want answers.

27:25.859 --> 27:27.997
And hopefully, I can help you get them.

27:28.064 --> 27:29.707
But I need you to know
there is always a chance

27:29.762 --> 27:33.447
that you will never know for certain
what did or didn't happen to you.

27:34.236 --> 27:37.067
And sometimes that's the hardest part.

27:39.929 --> 27:41.730
I was deep cover.

27:41.828 --> 27:45.658
Infiltrated a terrorist camp in
Northern Sudan for over three years.

27:45.693 --> 27:47.112
Charles set up my cover.

27:47.147 --> 27:49.237
Still no luck tracking down Charles.

27:49.286 --> 27:51.113
Patterson said she'd let
us know if she gets a hit.

27:51.186 --> 27:52.929
(Jane) Was Charles your handler?

27:53.292 --> 27:55.987
Since my first year out of Langley.

27:56.840 --> 27:59.861
And what about... Michael Murphy?

28:00.993 --> 28:02.652
Bridget Taylor?

28:02.687 --> 28:03.858
Agency go-betweens.

28:03.924 --> 28:06.212
They were supposed to be
using the intel I was getting

28:06.247 --> 28:07.856
to dismantle the terror network.

28:07.891 --> 28:12.015
Instead, they were using it to turn profit.

28:12.085 --> 28:15.222
Why not just report them to
their superiors at the CIA?

28:15.280 --> 28:18.245
I tried. About a year ago.

28:18.339 --> 28:20.567
Charles got wind of it,
burned me with the agency.

28:20.604 --> 28:24.239
Wiped my identity from the system.
It was like I never existed.

28:24.356 --> 28:26.730
Couple clicks, I was on my own.

28:26.777 --> 28:29.884
Went from playing a terrorist
to actually being one.

28:30.673 --> 28:34.116
And you had... no one else to go to?

28:34.574 --> 28:35.681
No family?

28:35.720 --> 28:37.249
Just my husband.

28:37.308 --> 28:39.366
I tried reaching out to him and...

28:39.455 --> 28:40.952
they killed him.

28:42.561 --> 28:44.284
And my daughter.

28:44.927 --> 28:46.862
Meridia.

28:46.864 --> 28:49.666
(crying) She was 14.

28:49.765 --> 28:51.389
I'm gonna go check on something.

28:51.459 --> 28:54.007
(Weller) If they killed
your family a year ago,

28:54.042 --> 28:56.500
why wait until now to go after them?

28:56.582 --> 28:57.567
Charles burned me.

28:57.608 --> 28:59.583
He outed me to the terror cell.

28:59.644 --> 29:02.633
They held me captive for nine months.

29:02.719 --> 29:04.623
But you escaped.

29:04.681 --> 29:06.178
Just barely.

29:07.297 --> 29:08.436
When I finally got to safety,

29:08.490 --> 29:10.914
I started planning my next move.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.581
I knew Charles, Michael, Bridget...

29:13.649 --> 29:16.711
used the museum charity
gala as their annual meeting.

29:19.328 --> 29:20.391
(Weller) What are your people saying?

29:20.426 --> 29:21.818
Is she really an operative or not?

29:21.888 --> 29:24.573
There's no record of her working
for either directorate to the CIA,

29:24.628 --> 29:26.270
or any other intelligence agency.

29:26.333 --> 29:27.465
Well, that doesn't mean anything.

29:27.516 --> 29:29.253
Yeah... she said they'd erased her.

29:29.314 --> 29:31.163
There's no record of
my time in the military,

29:31.218 --> 29:32.991
or of my torture at that black site.

29:33.026 --> 29:34.114
This is different.

29:34.149 --> 29:36.244
She would have been part
of sanctioned CIA operations

29:36.246 --> 29:37.425
before being burned.

29:37.448 --> 29:38.896
There'd be a paper trail of some kind,

29:38.967 --> 29:40.328
but so far, we've found nothing.

29:40.402 --> 29:42.717
Then you need to look harder,
because she's telling the truth.

29:42.719 --> 29:43.718
(phone buzzing)

29:43.720 --> 29:45.225
- _
- It's Patterson.

29:45.287 --> 29:46.679
She's got something.

29:49.558 --> 29:52.592
Turns out the two victims'
travel and investment portfolios

29:52.643 --> 29:56.689
were backed by shell companies that
siphon money from government accounts.

29:56.775 --> 29:59.242
Definitely not an art
scholar or a restaurateur.

29:59.320 --> 30:01.102
So Elizabeth was right. They're all spies.

30:01.104 --> 30:02.359
It looks like it.

30:02.437 --> 30:04.792
And Charles Kessler's State Department job

30:04.858 --> 30:07.179
is a classic official CIA cover.

30:07.242 --> 30:10.386
Vague, boring job title,
vague, boring job description.

30:10.421 --> 30:11.910
Any luck tracking him down?

30:11.988 --> 30:14.671
He hasn't used his cell phone or
his credit card since the museum,

30:14.723 --> 30:16.736
and no hits on any of his vehicles, either.

30:16.771 --> 30:17.617
He's laying low.

30:17.679 --> 30:20.216
Well, probably smart when a trained
killer with a grudge is after you.

30:20.261 --> 30:22.458
When Elizabeth mentioned
that she had a daughter,

30:22.528 --> 30:24.098
I remembered something I saw on the laptop

30:24.152 --> 30:26.210
we took from Charles's house.

30:27.004 --> 30:28.003
Who's the girl?

30:28.038 --> 30:30.405
No idea, that's why I
wanted to check it out.

30:30.440 --> 30:33.859
But, according to his records,
he doesn't have a daughter.

30:40.102 --> 30:42.512
My God. That's Meridia.

30:43.541 --> 30:45.655
How is this possible?

30:45.949 --> 30:48.793
They sent me photos from the
morgue. A death certificate.

30:48.828 --> 30:50.252
They must have faked them.

30:50.306 --> 30:54.097
(Weller) We pulled some school
records for a girl named Anne Sturz.

30:54.132 --> 30:56.473
She transferred to a school
in Queens around the same time

30:56.508 --> 30:58.016
that you said your daughter was killed.

30:58.051 --> 31:00.309
And before that, Anne Sturz didn't exist.

31:00.349 --> 31:01.577
(Zapata) Charles basically put Meridia

31:01.624 --> 31:03.473
into his own personal witness protection

31:03.508 --> 31:06.042
with no connection to you.

31:06.106 --> 31:07.900
Why would he take her at all?

31:09.069 --> 31:11.070
Because Meridia is his daughter.

31:11.959 --> 31:13.580
Care to elaborate on that?

31:13.646 --> 31:16.586
It was my first op... Bogota.

31:17.171 --> 31:19.438
Charles and I had an affair.

31:20.837 --> 31:21.994
I got pregnant.

31:22.058 --> 31:24.652
I never told him or my husband the truth.

31:24.687 --> 31:26.727
Apparently Charles figured it out.

31:26.762 --> 31:28.762
That certainly explains
why he kept her alive.

31:28.797 --> 31:31.076
Charles was a family friend
Meridia's entire life.

31:31.123 --> 31:33.205
She'd have no reason not to trust him.

31:33.240 --> 31:35.872
If Meridia's with Charles,
he won't just be laying low.

31:35.936 --> 31:39.126
No... he'll be trying to get Meridia
as far away from her as possible.

31:39.176 --> 31:41.291
Please, you have to find her.

31:44.747 --> 31:46.580
Once we took the search
parameters off Charles

31:46.687 --> 31:48.724
and focused on the daughter, we got a hit.

31:48.759 --> 31:51.808
Not a lot of 15-year-olds are taking
last-minute flights out of the country.

31:51.873 --> 31:53.948
A private jet to Mexico
City out of Teterboro

31:53.999 --> 31:56.257
was just hired by a
Larry and Sophie Morris,

31:56.333 --> 31:58.423
but it was paid for by
the same shell company

31:58.470 --> 32:00.063
that was paying Michael and Bridget.

32:00.136 --> 32:01.298
Flight leaves in less than an hour.

32:01.360 --> 32:02.693
Let's move.

32:03.726 --> 32:05.927
(jet engine humming)

32:05.929 --> 32:08.263
(police siren blaring)

32:09.698 --> 32:11.738
Get in the car and get down.

32:11.794 --> 32:13.662
I'm not gonna let them hurt you.

32:16.172 --> 32:17.705
(tires screeching)

32:21.923 --> 32:23.412
(Weller) FBI! Show me your hands!

32:23.447 --> 32:25.747
(gunshots)

32:48.704 --> 32:50.305
(sobbing) Daddy!

32:55.673 --> 32:57.173
(Weller) Meridia!

32:57.876 --> 32:59.415
You can come out now!

33:00.853 --> 33:04.110
We're FBI! It's safe to get out of the car.

33:05.486 --> 33:06.522
Duck!

33:07.297 --> 33:08.429
Down!

33:17.587 --> 33:18.527
What do we do?

33:18.562 --> 33:19.835
(gunshots)

33:19.882 --> 33:21.690
We can't return fire
on a 15-year-old.

33:21.746 --> 33:24.226
Meridia! We're here to help!

33:24.261 --> 33:26.147
Yeah, I don't think she believes us.

33:26.260 --> 33:27.952
(Weller) Meridia!

33:28.008 --> 33:29.708
Stop shooting at us so we can talk!

33:29.743 --> 33:32.043
You mean so you can shoot
me, like you shot my dad?

33:32.108 --> 33:34.074
Look, we're here to bring you to your mom.

33:34.142 --> 33:35.162
She wants to see you.

33:35.235 --> 33:36.468
My mother's dead!

33:36.527 --> 33:37.959
(gunshot)

33:38.037 --> 33:39.261
No, she's alive.

33:39.263 --> 33:41.348
She's at our office right now, Meridia.

33:41.383 --> 33:42.381
You're lying!

33:42.456 --> 33:43.716
(Weller) No! We're not!

33:43.767 --> 33:44.979
She's alive!

33:45.041 --> 33:47.135
(gunshot, shattering glass)

33:47.137 --> 33:48.678
(grunts)

33:48.713 --> 33:50.881
Your mother risked her life
so she could see you again.

Then where is she?!

33:52.513 --> 33:55.862
My dad told me she was
dead! He showed me photos!

33:55.897 --> 33:58.910
I'd be dead, too, if he didn't
hide me from people like you!

33:58.971 --> 34:02.373
Why would he lie to me? He loved me!

34:04.353 --> 34:07.823
I know... this doesn't
make any sense right now.

34:08.011 --> 34:09.936
But it is possible to lie to someone

34:10.025 --> 34:12.094

34:28.712 --> 34:30.090
And it's...

34:30.250 --> 34:32.806
It's hard to know what's right or wrong

34:32.858 --> 34:35.036

that your mother's alive...
