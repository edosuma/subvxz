00:01.653 --> 00:03.960
Previously onInstinct:I want to go see a friend

00:04.004 --> 00:05.266
who may be able to help.Great.

00:05.309 --> 00:07.094
I'll drive.He works undercover.

00:08.095 --> 00:09.618
DYLAN:
I'll take whatever

00:09.661 --> 00:10.880
you can get on the victims.

00:10.923 --> 00:12.621
You know things you're
not telling me,

00:12.664 --> 00:14.275
but these are my cases.

00:14.318 --> 00:17.060
And, uh, if I were to call,
what would I call you?

00:17.104 --> 00:18.192
Julian.

00:18.235 --> 00:20.455
Dylan, clearly I know
who Julian is,

00:20.498 --> 00:21.978
and we've met a couple of times.

00:30.856 --> 00:32.293
Thank you for
bringing me dinner.

00:32.336 --> 00:34.425
Doesn't make me feel
like a child at all.

00:34.469 --> 00:37.080
If I didn't, you wouldn't eat.

00:37.124 --> 00:39.082
Since you and Max fought,

00:39.126 --> 00:41.084
you've been
practically sleeping here.

00:41.128 --> 00:42.738
I'm okay. I love my work.

00:42.781 --> 00:44.392
You don't need
to worry about me.

00:44.435 --> 00:46.046
I'm your mom.

00:46.089 --> 00:47.699
Worrying about you is my job.

00:47.743 --> 00:49.527
And this is my job,
and it'd be nice

00:49.571 --> 00:51.747
if no one saw my mother
delivering me food.

00:51.790 --> 00:53.096
Promise me you'll leave soon.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.532
Done. I love you.

00:54.576 --> 00:55.490

I love you, too.

Dylan!

02:06.300 --> 02:08.040
Wha...?

02:08.084 --> 02:09.868
You okay?
Yeah.

02:09.912 --> 02:10.956
Everything's great. Amazing.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.002
Uh, I just spoke
to that social worker.

02:13.045 --> 02:15.135
She was able to move up
our home visit.

02:15.178 --> 02:16.962
To today.

02:17.006 --> 02:19.661
Oh, great.

02:19.704 --> 02:20.792
You sure about that?

02:20.836 --> 02:22.446
That-that "great"
didn't sound so great.

02:22.490 --> 02:23.882
No, it was a great "great."

02:23.926 --> 02:24.970
Great.

02:25.014 --> 02:27.059
I'm just a little taken
by surprise.

02:27.103 --> 02:28.583
Weren't there some videos
we had to watch?

02:28.626 --> 02:29.845
Yeah, I got 'em covered.

02:36.199 --> 02:37.157
I should take this.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.246
Uh-huh.
Hello?

02:41.248 --> 02:43.467
T-Try to calm down.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.862
Okay, I'll be right there.

02:46.905 --> 02:49.081
And you gotta go.

02:49.125 --> 02:50.082
It's Joan.

02:50.126 --> 02:51.475
A colleague's been found dead.

02:51.519 --> 02:54.043
I'll be back
for the meeting.

02:54.086 --> 02:55.436
So long.

03:05.750 --> 03:08.013
Hi. What are you doing here?

03:08.057 --> 03:09.145
You didn't answer your phone.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.233
Oh. Oh, sorry.

03:10.277 --> 03:11.713
I-I, uh, overslept.

03:11.756 --> 03:13.584
Uh, it was charging.

03:13.628 --> 03:15.499
Everything okay?

03:17.719 --> 03:20.896
Should I be
asking you that?

03:20.939 --> 03:21.984
LIZZIE:
Oh, boy.

03:22.027 --> 03:23.203
Hello, Dylan.

03:24.595 --> 03:26.728
Good morning, Julian.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.817
Maybe we should all have
a bit of a chat.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.122
I just made tea.

03:30.166 --> 03:32.473
And I just got a call
about a dead woman,

03:32.516 --> 03:34.126
so while I'd love
for the three of us

03:34.170 --> 03:38.914
to catch up-- and believe me,
I would love to be caught up--

03:38.957 --> 03:41.351
Detective Needham
and I have to go.

03:44.398 --> 03:46.182
I'll talk to
you later.

03:48.532 --> 03:50.186
We should talk
about it.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.232
As I've been telling you,
you're both adults,

03:52.275 --> 03:53.624
and it's none
of my business.

03:53.668 --> 03:55.365
And as I've been
telling you, I'm sorry.

03:55.409 --> 03:56.975
I know I should
have told you.

03:57.019 --> 03:59.848
Look, I'm not here
to judge you.

03:59.891 --> 04:02.242
Even if sleeping
with my closest friend,

04:02.285 --> 04:04.200
who happens to be
an award-winning playboy,

04:04.244 --> 04:06.115
is a stupid, stupid idea.

04:06.158 --> 04:07.943
Thank you for
not judging.

04:07.986 --> 04:09.161
Vic died last night--
Kristy Walker.

04:09.205 --> 04:10.511
Found this a.m.
by the cleaning crew.

04:10.554 --> 04:11.729
Looks like a suicide.

04:11.773 --> 04:13.165
Where's Joan?Conference room

04:13.209 --> 04:15.777
with the vic's mom
and Whitehead, the publisher.

04:21.565 --> 04:23.175
HARRIS:
Looks like a handprint.

04:32.663 --> 04:34.186
LIZZIE:
She's missing a ring, and...

04:35.536 --> 04:38.321
There's no black
on her hands.

04:38.365 --> 04:41.324
What is that smudge?

04:46.286 --> 04:49.419
Smells like suspension grease
from a car or a motorcycle.

04:49.463 --> 04:51.508
And that looks like
a clove hitch-- climber's knot.

04:59.342 --> 05:02.693
And that is an engagement ring.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.831
This was not a suicide.

05:09.874 --> 05:13.051
I think this killer
felt betrayed.

05:13.095 --> 05:16.838
Didn't want her to get married,
and wanted us to know.

05:20.972 --> 05:23.323
♪

05:33.768 --> 05:36.901
We are so sorry
for your loss.

05:36.945 --> 05:39.687
I spoke to my baby
just last night.

05:39.730 --> 05:40.688
LIZZIE:
Did she tell you

05:40.731 --> 05:41.950
anything unusual?

05:41.993 --> 05:44.213
She was working late.

05:44.256 --> 05:46.171
Told her to go home,

05:46.215 --> 05:49.044
but she is so committed
to this job.

05:49.087 --> 05:50.437
LIZZIE:
Do you know anyone

05:50.480 --> 05:53.440
who may want to cause her harm?

05:53.483 --> 05:55.355
WHITEHEAD:
Speaking as her boss...

05:55.398 --> 05:58.009
No. Kristy was
bright, engaged,

05:58.053 --> 06:01.273
almost idealistic
in this cynical business.

06:01.317 --> 06:03.841
She was my favorite
junior editor.

06:03.885 --> 06:08.150
She was smart
and hard-working and charming.

06:08.193 --> 06:12.284
Would anyone stand
to benefit here by her death?

06:12.328 --> 06:13.808
Honey, this is
a publishing house,

06:13.851 --> 06:15.070
not Game of Thrones.

06:15.113 --> 06:17.289
Everybody rooted for Kristy.

06:17.333 --> 06:19.553
I mean, she just landed a book

06:19.596 --> 06:22.033
she swore was gonna be
a monster best seller.

06:22.077 --> 06:23.774
What kind of book?

06:23.818 --> 06:25.254
Well, Kristy kept it a secret.

06:25.297 --> 06:28.213
She did say that, uh,
it was based on a true story

06:28.257 --> 06:30.433
and that only three people
knew the truth.

06:30.477 --> 06:34.698
And it was her,
the author and...

06:34.742 --> 06:36.570
Charles.Well, not yet.

06:36.613 --> 06:38.267
We'd set up a meeting
for Monday,

06:38.310 --> 06:40.269
and she was going to pitch it.

06:40.312 --> 06:42.402
Anyone else
that you can think of?

06:42.445 --> 06:44.491
Boyfriend

06:44.534 --> 06:48.582
Uh, Kristy was engaged
to a guy named Max Fisher.

06:48.625 --> 06:50.453
An artist type.

06:50.497 --> 06:53.587
She had just broken off
the engagement.

06:53.630 --> 06:55.676
Did he, by any chance,
like to climb mountains

06:55.719 --> 06:58.113
or have experience
with climbing knots?

06:58.156 --> 07:01.856
Yes, he was very passionate
about it.

07:04.989 --> 07:07.296
True stories can
make people touchy

07:07.339 --> 07:08.776
if they don't
like the truth.

07:08.819 --> 07:10.691
Uh, you know what else
can make people touchy?

07:10.734 --> 07:12.606
When your fiancée
breaks up with you.

07:12.649 --> 07:15.130
Uh, the victim's fiancé,
Max Fisher,

07:15.173 --> 07:16.566
never showed up for work today.

07:16.610 --> 07:18.568
His doorman said he left
the building last night

07:18.612 --> 07:20.352
with a bag, and in a hurry.

07:20.396 --> 07:21.615
Heard him speed away.

07:21.658 --> 07:23.747
I'll see if we
can track him.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.621
Lizzie, can you come
in here a moment?

07:32.843 --> 07:34.715
Take a seat.

07:34.758 --> 07:37.065
Everything okay?

07:37.108 --> 07:39.110
You tell me.

07:40.634 --> 07:43.854
Was the evidence in that
live-streaming steampunk case

07:43.898 --> 07:45.160
properly obtained?

07:45.203 --> 07:47.118
The Montgomery case?

07:47.162 --> 07:48.163
Yes. Why?

07:48.206 --> 07:49.773
'Cause the D.A.
is asking

07:49.817 --> 07:52.341
how you and Reinhart managed
to pinpoint the victim,

07:52.384 --> 07:54.343
given the scrambled
GPS information

07:54.386 --> 07:57.738
and the thousands of addresses
that you had to sort through.

07:57.781 --> 08:00.741
We narrowed down
the geographical options,

08:00.784 --> 08:03.178
used some instinct,
maybe a little bit of luck.

08:03.221 --> 08:04.658
Yeah, more like a lot of luck.

08:04.701 --> 08:05.876
Okay, well, you do know

08:05.920 --> 08:07.487
that if you got any
evidence unlawfully,

08:07.530 --> 08:09.619
every case that you've ever
been involved with

08:09.663 --> 08:11.273
will be under review.

08:11.316 --> 08:13.580
If they find any
impropriety,

08:13.623 --> 08:16.974
criminals will be released,
and you will be prosecuted.

08:17.018 --> 08:19.020
I'm aware.

08:19.063 --> 08:21.022
Anything else?

08:21.065 --> 08:23.590
Lizzie, remember,
you're part of a team.

08:23.633 --> 08:25.200
My team.

08:25.243 --> 08:28.029
If there's something
I need to know,

08:28.072 --> 08:32.163
tell me now rather than later,
or I won't be able to help.

08:34.122 --> 08:36.341
I love you, too.

08:37.604 --> 08:38.996
That was Andy.

08:39.040 --> 08:41.521
I figured. You know,
detective skills and all.

08:41.564 --> 08:44.872
We have a meeting later with
a social worker about adoption.

08:44.915 --> 08:46.047
Adoption?

08:46.090 --> 08:47.439
Are you excited?

08:47.483 --> 08:48.484
Yes. Very.

08:49.529 --> 08:52.053
How'd it go in there?Oh. Super.

08:52.096 --> 08:53.620
HARRIS: Found the
victim's fiancé.

08:53.663 --> 08:55.186
He's over at
Crosstown Hospital.

08:55.230 --> 08:57.232
Got in a nasty accident,
lots of broken bones.

08:57.275 --> 08:59.060
It wasn't a motorcycle,
by any chance?

08:59.103 --> 09:00.627
How did you know?

09:00.670 --> 09:02.063
Black grease at the scene,

09:02.106 --> 09:04.979
and the doorman said
he heard him speed away.

09:05.022 --> 09:06.589
Detective skills and all.

09:08.112 --> 09:09.461
I was heading to my family's

09:09.505 --> 09:11.159
country house
in the Berkshires.

09:11.202 --> 09:14.771
I was on the highway when
a deer bolted across the road.

09:14.815 --> 09:17.948
I swerved out of the way
and lost my balance.

09:17.992 --> 09:20.647
Why were you leaving town?

09:21.909 --> 09:23.954
I had a fight with my fiancée.

09:23.998 --> 09:25.086
About what?

09:25.129 --> 09:26.261
What does that have to do

09:26.304 --> 09:27.567
with my motorcycle accident?

09:27.610 --> 09:28.785
Answer the question, please.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.179
She had been in contact with

09:31.222 --> 09:33.355
her high school
sweetheart, Chad.

09:33.398 --> 09:35.749
She claimed
he was writing a book,

09:35.792 --> 09:37.185
but I Googled him.

09:37.228 --> 09:39.143
He isn't an author.

09:39.187 --> 09:41.450
In fact, he hasn't done anything
since graduating from college.

09:41.493 --> 09:44.061
You thought they were
rekindling their relationship?

09:44.105 --> 09:45.628
She isn't the type.

09:45.672 --> 09:47.674
But ever since she started
talking with him again,

09:47.717 --> 09:49.458
she seemed different.

09:49.501 --> 09:51.503
What kind of different?

09:51.547 --> 09:53.027
It's hard to describe.

09:53.070 --> 09:55.595
She was both excited
and kind of wary,

09:55.638 --> 09:57.118
like she was hiding something.

09:57.161 --> 09:59.686
So I followed Kristy
to a bar the other night.

09:59.729 --> 10:01.122
Chad was there.

10:02.166 --> 10:03.646
I lost it.

10:03.690 --> 10:06.170
I yelled at her, yelled at him,

10:06.214 --> 10:08.999
and then she said, if...

10:09.043 --> 10:11.828
if I can't trust her, then we
shouldn't be getting married.

10:11.872 --> 10:12.873
Did that make you angry?

10:12.916 --> 10:14.396
You're damn right it did.

10:14.439 --> 10:15.527
Angry enough to kill her?

10:15.571 --> 10:17.094
Kill her?

10:17.138 --> 10:19.053
LIZZIE:
Max, Kristy's dead.

10:19.096 --> 10:20.663
She was murdered last night.

10:23.318 --> 10:24.493
What?

10:24.536 --> 10:26.408
Kristy?

10:27.844 --> 10:29.585
She was...

10:35.504 --> 10:38.333
I'm sorry.

10:48.473 --> 10:50.519
Hi. I'm Andy.

10:50.562 --> 10:51.781
This is Dylan.

10:51.825 --> 10:53.522
Oh.

10:54.566 --> 10:56.133
Uh, what a lovely home.

10:56.177 --> 10:58.092
May I come in?

10:58.135 --> 10:59.920
Yeah, of course. Yes.Of course.

11:04.228 --> 11:09.146
Andy, what parenting skills
do you feel you currently have?

11:09.190 --> 11:12.846
Uh, uh, well, for a newborn,
we've been practicing, um,

11:12.889 --> 11:15.631
uh, feedings, sleep routines,
bonding, swaddling.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.633
And as the baby
gets older,

11:17.677 --> 11:18.808
the importance
of self-discipline,

11:18.852 --> 11:22.159
expectations, uh,
behavior modeling.

11:22.203 --> 11:25.728
Uh, uh, Dylan, uh,
what do you believe

11:25.772 --> 11:28.513
a child needs to know
about its birth family?

11:28.557 --> 11:30.298
And thoughts
on maintaining

11:30.341 --> 11:32.909
birth parent connections.

11:32.953 --> 11:34.911
Um, well, we intend

11:34.955 --> 11:37.697
to tell our child about
his or her birth family

11:37.740 --> 11:38.959
when it's age appropriate.

11:39.002 --> 11:41.439
And, um, if he or she
wants to reach out

11:41.483 --> 11:43.615
to that family,
we-we won't stand in their way.

11:43.659 --> 11:45.835
Mmm.

11:46.923 --> 11:50.100
What a gorgeous frame.

11:50.144 --> 11:53.495
And what about teaching
the child about normal families?

11:53.538 --> 11:55.236
Normal?

11:56.890 --> 11:57.978
Do you know any
normal families?

11:58.021 --> 11:59.240
'Cause I sure don't.

11:59.283 --> 12:00.981
I'm sorry.

12:01.024 --> 12:02.417
You're absolutely right.

12:02.460 --> 12:04.201
I meant...

12:04.245 --> 12:05.463
more traditional.

12:05.507 --> 12:06.856
Uh, moving on.

12:08.292 --> 12:10.599
What impact do
you see adoption

12:10.642 --> 12:14.211
having on your significant
relationships,

12:14.255 --> 12:18.650
uh, uh, especially your
relationship with your, uh...

12:21.131 --> 12:22.654
The word you're
searching for is "husband."

12:22.698 --> 12:24.613
We are both husbands,
but in a traditional way.Dylan.

12:25.657 --> 12:26.789
ANDY:
Listen.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.312
Please understand, we...

12:28.356 --> 12:30.793
we have fought extra hard
to adopt this baby.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.926
We-we will care extra hard
when we do adopt one,

12:32.969 --> 12:35.798
and we will love our baby
extra hard

12:35.842 --> 12:37.800
every day of their life.

12:37.844 --> 12:41.108
We just want a family.

12:41.151 --> 12:43.806
And you will not find a
human being on this planet

12:43.850 --> 12:45.547
who will make a better
parent than Andy,

12:45.590 --> 12:47.723
and I think that's
all you need to know.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.771
Then it seems we are through.

12:58.821 --> 13:00.431
Do you not want a baby?

13:04.522 --> 13:06.002
How can you ask me that?

13:06.046 --> 13:08.222
You were openly hostile to her.

13:08.265 --> 13:09.658
She was openly judgmental.

13:09.701 --> 13:10.702
Oh, please.

13:12.052 --> 13:15.055
Look... I love you
defending us

13:15.098 --> 13:15.969
and what we're trying
to do here,

13:16.012 --> 13:17.492
but fight that fight anywhere

13:17.535 --> 13:20.103
but with the one person
whose stamp of approval we need.

13:20.147 --> 13:21.322
That bigot wouldn't
have given her approval

13:21.365 --> 13:22.497
no matter what we said.

13:22.540 --> 13:23.890
Come on, Dylan.
She wasn't a bigot.

13:23.933 --> 13:24.934
She...

13:34.509 --> 13:35.858
It's Lizzie.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.555
Our case.

13:37.599 --> 13:38.948
Okay.

13:38.992 --> 13:40.689
Well, be sure
to ridicule her, too.

13:46.434 --> 13:48.262
Hey. How did it go?

13:48.305 --> 13:49.393
Super.

13:49.437 --> 13:51.178
Did you just say "super"?

13:51.221 --> 13:52.701
That can't be good.

13:54.224 --> 13:56.052
Lab confirmed that the
smudge on the rope

13:56.096 --> 13:58.228
is suspension grease...
from a motorcycle.

13:58.272 --> 13:59.534
So it could be Max.

13:59.577 --> 14:00.970
And the rope around
Kristy's neck

14:01.014 --> 14:02.450
had his fingerprints on it,

14:02.493 --> 14:04.147
which matches the
handprints at the scene.

14:04.191 --> 14:07.455
And we found the exact same
rope in Max's apartment.

14:07.498 --> 14:09.022
So it was Max.

14:09.065 --> 14:10.588
Not quite.

14:10.632 --> 14:12.329
The ambulance picked up
Max on the highway

14:12.373 --> 14:14.418
30 minutes before
Kristy's time of death.

14:14.462 --> 14:16.507
Oh, you might
have led with that.

14:16.551 --> 14:18.031
So it couldn't be Max.

14:18.074 --> 14:21.251
Someone was framing him.Why?

14:21.295 --> 14:23.645
LIZZIE: Let's hope Chad's
apartment gives us a clue.

14:23.688 --> 14:24.776
Here you go.Thank you.

14:24.820 --> 14:27.388
So, anything on Chad?Nothing.

14:27.431 --> 14:28.737
No social media
footprint.

14:28.780 --> 14:30.652
So, how'd we end up here?

14:30.695 --> 14:31.783
Uh, Fucci found
this address

14:31.827 --> 14:33.133
on the Dodson
Alumni Directory.

14:33.176 --> 14:34.525
Mm-hmm.

14:37.833 --> 14:40.836
So, you're writing
a secret book,

14:40.880 --> 14:42.794
where do you keep it?

14:42.838 --> 14:44.535
I write at my desk.

14:44.579 --> 14:45.362
You're a renegade.

14:46.537 --> 14:48.539
A writing desk but no computer?

14:48.583 --> 14:49.584
I write by hand.

14:49.627 --> 14:51.412
Of course you do.

14:51.455 --> 14:53.936
Longhand activates
parts of the brain

14:53.980 --> 14:56.199
involved in thinking
and working memory,

14:56.243 --> 14:58.288
and allows you to store
and manage information.

14:58.332 --> 15:01.161
Also, you're more exposed
to critical thinking

15:01.204 --> 15:02.902
when you write by hand
rather than type.

15:02.945 --> 15:05.034
Yeah, I'm being exposed to some

15:05.078 --> 15:06.862
pretty critical thinking
right now.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.517
I think I may have
found something.

15:17.742 --> 15:19.657
You "think" you found something?

15:21.964 --> 15:23.923
LIZZIE:
Just like Kristy.
Climber's knots.

15:25.011 --> 15:26.838
Cool to the touch.

15:26.882 --> 15:29.319
He's been here
at least 24 hours.

15:29.363 --> 15:33.280
This purplish discoloration,
consistent with lividity.

15:33.323 --> 15:34.934
Don't touch the body.

15:36.761 --> 15:40.069
Rigor mortis without external
signs of decomposition,

15:40.113 --> 15:43.507
which places the time of death
at less than 36 hours.

15:44.769 --> 15:46.336
Somebody went to a lot of effort

15:46.380 --> 15:48.556
framing a guy who we know
was in an accident

15:48.599 --> 15:49.644
and couldn't have done it.

15:49.687 --> 15:51.080
And they would
have succeeded

15:51.124 --> 15:53.474
if that deer hadn't bolted out
into the road,

15:53.517 --> 15:55.171
and Max would be going
to prison for a lifetime

15:55.215 --> 15:56.781
instead of lying
in a hospital bed.

15:56.825 --> 15:59.349
Luckiest motorcycle accident
anyone ever had.

15:59.393 --> 16:01.047
But if you're framing Max,

16:01.090 --> 16:03.745
why go to the trouble
of hanging them?

16:03.788 --> 16:06.008
They could be trying
to send a message.

16:06.052 --> 16:08.837
Could be a public-display death.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.057
Someone has to cut 'em down.

16:11.100 --> 16:14.234
It's a shock to the loved ones.

16:14.277 --> 16:16.062
If we're meant to think
that Kristy and Chad

16:16.105 --> 16:17.411
were having an affair--
which they weren't--

16:17.454 --> 16:18.629
what were they really doing?

16:18.673 --> 16:19.848
What connects them?

16:19.891 --> 16:21.154
It's gotta be
the book.

16:21.197 --> 16:22.546
Yes.

16:22.590 --> 16:24.592
The rope, the knot,
the fingerprints.

16:24.635 --> 16:27.769
Just enough clues,
but not too many.

16:27.812 --> 16:29.771
Whoever killed Kristy and Chad

16:29.814 --> 16:34.471
is not just some amateur loner
with an axe to grind.

16:34.515 --> 16:36.734
This is a professional
operation.

16:45.874 --> 16:49.530
He had a hard time
finding himself after college.

16:49.573 --> 16:51.880
Recently, Chad was doing better.

16:51.923 --> 16:55.188
Mm-hmm.Finally finding himself.

16:55.231 --> 16:56.624
He was sober.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.408
Just moved to a new place.

16:58.452 --> 17:00.019
Socializing again.

17:00.062 --> 17:03.196
Chad was back in touch
with Kristy Walker.

17:03.239 --> 17:04.501
Do you remember her?

17:04.545 --> 17:06.329
Kristy? Of course.

17:06.373 --> 17:07.678
They were high school
sweethearts.

17:07.722 --> 17:09.463
She was the one
who got away.

17:09.506 --> 17:12.553
He never met a better
girl than her.

17:12.596 --> 17:14.381
It's just horrible.
I'm sorry.

17:14.424 --> 17:16.035
Could you excuse us?

17:21.344 --> 17:22.389
Is that...

17:22.432 --> 17:23.390
Oh, Tucker.Hi.

17:23.433 --> 17:24.391
Bobby Concannon.

17:24.434 --> 17:25.435
Our next Senator.

17:25.479 --> 17:27.089
MOTHER: Chad loved
you both so much.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.091
CONCANNON:
This is awful.
I'm so sorry.

17:29.135 --> 17:30.875
I know. Thank you.

17:32.442 --> 17:35.358
Uh, these are some
detectives from the NYPD

17:35.402 --> 17:36.968
looking into
what happened.

17:37.012 --> 17:39.058
Bobby Concannon.
Good to meet you.

17:39.754 --> 17:40.972
Tucker Brophy.

17:41.016 --> 17:43.453
Dylan Reinhart.
This is Detective Needham.

17:43.497 --> 17:44.585
WOMAN:
Mr. and Mrs. Kentwood?

17:44.628 --> 17:46.326
The minister's
on the phone.

17:47.153 --> 17:49.068
If you'll excuse us.

17:54.508 --> 17:56.031
Did either of you notice

17:56.075 --> 17:57.728
anything different
about Chad lately?

17:57.772 --> 17:59.643
I hadn't seen Chad
for a few years now.

17:59.687 --> 18:01.254
Bobby's been busy.

18:01.297 --> 18:03.212
I kept up with Chad.

18:03.256 --> 18:06.302
His life derailed a
bit after college.

18:06.346 --> 18:08.304
Wanted to make sure he wasn't
gonna do anything stupid.

18:08.348 --> 18:09.610
LIZZIE:
Stupid?

18:09.653 --> 18:11.699
BROPHY:
He used drugs for a time.

18:11.742 --> 18:12.787
He drank.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.745
Signs of desperation,
cries for help.

18:14.789 --> 18:16.399
I didn't want him
to give up.

18:16.443 --> 18:18.575
We take care of each other.

18:18.619 --> 18:21.274
And by "we,"
you mean Lambsmen?

18:23.624 --> 18:25.495
I've heard exciting things
about Lambsmen.

18:25.539 --> 18:27.062
Wish I could say I knew
about it firsthand.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.803
Hmm. Me, too.

18:28.846 --> 18:31.545
Don't worry. I know you're
not allowed to talk about it.

18:32.807 --> 18:34.243
Boys.

18:35.853 --> 18:38.117
Look, if there's anything
we can do to help,

18:38.160 --> 18:40.336
just let us know.

18:45.515 --> 18:47.300
Lambsmen?

18:47.343 --> 18:49.911
It's a secret
society at Dodson.

18:49.954 --> 18:51.565
What made you think
they were in it?

18:51.608 --> 18:53.132
Their wristwatches.

18:53.175 --> 18:55.003
They were both exactly
five minutes fast.

18:55.046 --> 18:57.179
Lambsmen operate
on their own time,

18:57.223 --> 18:59.834
which is five minutes
ahead of us regular folk.

18:59.877 --> 19:02.228
So, if a Lambsmen meeting
is called for 6:00,

19:02.271 --> 19:04.186
it would actually begin
at what you or I

19:04.230 --> 19:06.667
ignorantly would call 5:55.

19:06.710 --> 19:08.886
Mmm. Sounds very normal.

19:08.930 --> 19:10.540
How do you know all this?

19:10.584 --> 19:13.587
My dad was a Lambsman.

19:13.630 --> 19:14.718
He wanted me to join.

19:14.762 --> 19:16.198
No, thanks.

19:16.242 --> 19:19.593
Those places operate under
an extreme tribal mentality.

19:19.636 --> 19:22.987
If they know anything,
they won't tell us.

19:23.031 --> 19:24.772
What are you doing?

19:24.815 --> 19:28.123
Uh, another tribe
that's intensely loyal

19:28.167 --> 19:30.995
is sobriety programs.

19:31.039 --> 19:33.911
There's a meeting right now
around the corner from Chad's.

19:33.955 --> 19:35.478
[bell dings,
elevator doors open]

19:38.046 --> 19:39.917
I heard about Chad.

19:39.961 --> 19:41.223
It's horrible.

19:41.267 --> 19:43.269
He was a sweet guy.

19:43.312 --> 19:45.445
He was sober almost a year.

19:45.488 --> 19:47.316
I was his sponsor.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.971
Did Chad ever talk about
a book he was writing?

19:50.014 --> 19:52.756
Yeah. Not in any detail.

19:52.800 --> 19:55.977
He said it was a story
he wanted to tell for 15 years,

19:56.020 --> 19:58.980
and sharing it was
a big part of his step nine,

19:59.023 --> 20:00.460
making amends.

20:00.503 --> 20:03.114
15 years ago,
he would have been in school.

20:03.158 --> 20:06.379
Did he mention anyone who would
have been against the book?

20:08.729 --> 20:11.819
He said someone visited him
the other day.

20:11.862 --> 20:14.213
Uh, it left Chad shaken.

20:14.256 --> 20:16.302
Did he say who?

20:16.345 --> 20:18.782
Oh, no. He was really vague
about it all.

20:18.826 --> 20:20.567
Thank you.

20:22.482 --> 20:25.267
Brophy mentioned
Chad's crappy apartment.

20:25.311 --> 20:28.531
There's only one way he'd
know how crappy it was.

20:30.141 --> 20:32.492
Yeah, I visited Chad.

20:32.535 --> 20:34.711
Like I told you, I periodically
checked in on him.

20:34.755 --> 20:36.104
LIZZIE:
You left out the detail

20:36.147 --> 20:38.193
about seeing him
the day before he was killed.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.240
Chad was like a brother to me.

20:41.283 --> 20:44.243
We take care of one another,
especially the weaker ones.

20:44.286 --> 20:46.027
Oh. We're just
trying to find out

20:46.070 --> 20:48.334
who killed your brother.

20:48.377 --> 20:50.336
Chad's mother said
that he was stronger.

20:50.379 --> 20:52.207
So did his sponsor.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.253
I didn't see it, but I am
glad to hear about it.

20:54.296 --> 20:55.645
He deserved it.

20:55.689 --> 20:57.647
What about Kristy Walker?
Did you know her?

20:57.691 --> 20:59.867
Kristy, his high school
girlfriend?

20:59.910 --> 21:01.260
Uh-huh.I met her in college,

21:01.303 --> 21:02.913
when she visited.

21:02.957 --> 21:05.655
:
Yeah, I remember her being...

21:05.699 --> 21:07.353
very kind and a little funny.

21:07.396 --> 21:11.574
Did Chad mention anything about
a book that he was working on?

21:11.618 --> 21:13.663
A book?

21:13.707 --> 21:16.318
Chad had been in such bad shape,
he couldn't read a book

21:16.362 --> 21:18.451
these last years,
let alone write one.

21:18.494 --> 21:19.930
I don't like him.

21:19.974 --> 21:22.019
I have a feeling
he gets that a lot.

21:22.063 --> 21:24.283
So, Chad writes a book
that Kristy is editing.

21:24.326 --> 21:26.328
It's a true story
that's gonna be a best seller,

21:26.372 --> 21:28.983
but no one's read it
or knows where it is,

21:29.026 --> 21:31.986
and they both end up dead.

21:32.029 --> 21:33.988
Hello.

21:34.031 --> 21:36.077
Andy, what's the matter?

21:37.339 --> 21:39.123
Are you okay?

21:39.167 --> 21:40.647
Yeah.

21:41.430 --> 21:42.605
Thank God.

21:42.649 --> 21:43.911
What happened?

21:43.954 --> 21:45.347
I just got back
from the gym.

21:45.391 --> 21:46.740
I heard something
in your office.

21:46.783 --> 21:48.263
I ran in.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.786
No one was there.

21:51.222 --> 21:52.789
You sure you
heard something?

21:52.833 --> 21:55.183
Yes. And there was nowhere
for them to get out.

21:55.226 --> 21:56.532
I mean...

21:57.794 --> 21:59.622
Unless he climbed out

21:59.666 --> 22:01.798
through the skylight
or something.

22:05.367 --> 22:08.022
Well, whoever it was
only wanted information.

22:08.065 --> 22:10.546
They didn't take anything
of financial value.

22:14.594 --> 22:16.596
What are you doing?

22:40.228 --> 22:42.752
What is that?

22:42.796 --> 22:45.276
DYLAN:
An extremely high-end

22:45.320 --> 22:46.974
surveillance mic.

22:47.017 --> 22:48.628
Where's it from?

22:48.671 --> 22:50.586
I don't know.

22:51.761 --> 22:53.981
But I know
someone who will.

22:55.504 --> 22:57.376
So, how is it?

22:58.681 --> 23:01.292
Uh, tastes like tea.

23:01.336 --> 23:03.338
You know, there's
a way of saying it

23:03.382 --> 23:05.514
that makes it sound
more joyful.

23:06.689 --> 23:08.387
Tastes like tea!

23:09.779 --> 23:11.433
We'll work on it.

23:11.477 --> 23:12.782
Will we?

23:12.826 --> 23:14.871
You're very self-assured.

23:14.915 --> 23:16.482
It's all an act.

23:21.878 --> 23:23.184
Hello, Dylan.

23:23.227 --> 23:24.968
What are you doing?

23:25.012 --> 23:26.883
Going for a walk.

23:28.058 --> 23:29.016
I've been bugged.

23:29.059 --> 23:30.017
Did you find the mic?

23:30.060 --> 23:31.671
Yes.JULIAN: Send me a picture.

23:31.714 --> 23:34.195
When I get back,
I'll dig into it.

23:34.238 --> 23:35.675
Everything okay?

23:35.718 --> 23:38.895
Somebody appears to be
listening in on our friend.

23:38.939 --> 23:40.506
Dylan

23:40.549 --> 23:43.422
That's what I want
to help him find out.

23:44.597 --> 23:45.902
I need to go. I'm sorry.

23:45.946 --> 23:47.556
Oh, it's fi... Oh!

23:53.562 --> 23:55.172
Wow. Okay, that was...

23:55.216 --> 23:56.783
Let's keep walking.

23:56.826 --> 23:58.567
What's wrong?

23:58.611 --> 24:00.917
There's a woman
in a gray scarf

24:00.961 --> 24:03.006
about half a block
behind us.

24:04.312 --> 24:05.574
Brown hair?

24:05.618 --> 24:07.054
Yes.

24:07.097 --> 24:08.664
She was in the
bookstore.

24:08.708 --> 24:10.274
Precisely.

24:10.318 --> 24:12.929
At the corner,
we'll say good-bye.

24:12.973 --> 24:15.105
I'll have her follow me
to the right.

24:15.149 --> 24:16.933
You keep going straight.

24:16.977 --> 24:18.892
Okay.

24:18.935 --> 24:20.459
I'll call you later.

24:20.502 --> 24:22.069
Mm-hmm.

24:34.298 --> 24:35.517
Lizzie!

24:35.561 --> 24:36.562
Lizzie!

24:48.095 --> 24:49.749
JULIAN:
Let her go. We have her car.

24:57.452 --> 24:58.932
She was following
you, not me.

25:00.411 --> 25:02.283
And Dylan's apartment
was broken into?

25:02.326 --> 25:03.893
What's going on?

25:05.808 --> 25:08.332
Her car may give us the answer.

25:13.250 --> 25:14.730
Run!

25:15.644 --> 25:18.255
[people screaming,
frantic chatter]

25:18.299 --> 25:20.040
You okay?

25:30.093 --> 25:31.486
It was a controlled
explosion.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.009
To clean the car
of any evidence.

25:33.053 --> 25:34.271
Very polished.

25:34.315 --> 25:35.795
And the device found
in your apartment

25:35.838 --> 25:37.536
is so high-tech
it's not available

25:37.579 --> 25:39.015
to CIA operatives.

25:39.059 --> 25:40.582
Only a few governments and
private intelligence firms

25:40.626 --> 25:43.063
have any access
to this type of equipment.

25:43.106 --> 25:45.065
Uh, could Dorsett Hill be one?

25:45.108 --> 25:47.328
I wouldn't be surprised.

25:47.371 --> 25:48.198
Why do you ask?

25:48.242 --> 25:48.982
Guess who owns Dorsett Hill.

25:50.113 --> 25:52.289
Guess.

25:52.333 --> 25:53.682
I don't know.

25:53.726 --> 25:55.379
Misquamicut Holdings.

25:55.423 --> 25:56.816
Brophy's company.

25:56.859 --> 25:58.687
Brophy?Concannon's buddy.

25:58.731 --> 26:00.602
If there was anything
in Chad's book

26:00.646 --> 26:02.473
to implicate him,
Brophy would go after

26:02.517 --> 26:03.649
anyone who had
knowledge of it,

26:03.692 --> 26:05.302
including those of us
investigating.

26:05.346 --> 26:07.043
That's why that woman
was following you.

26:07.087 --> 26:08.349
And why your place was bugged.

26:08.392 --> 26:09.698
You two have to be very careful.

26:09.742 --> 26:10.917
Dorsett Hill is ruthless.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.440
They will destroy
anyone in their path.

26:12.483 --> 26:14.355
Wait, wait, wait.

26:14.398 --> 26:17.184
That's Concannon, Brophy,
Chad, and...

26:17.227 --> 26:18.402
who's the fourth guy?

26:21.318 --> 26:22.842
The young man's
name was Tony Holt.

26:22.885 --> 26:24.626
He disappeared when
he was a junior.

26:24.670 --> 26:27.237
Maybe he's who the book's about.

26:27.281 --> 26:29.022
Something happened to him.
It was 15 years ago.

26:29.065 --> 26:30.937
It could make a riveting story.The kind of story

26:30.980 --> 26:32.329
you'd like to write
a book about.

26:32.373 --> 26:33.635
But you wouldn't want it written

26:33.679 --> 26:35.071
if it was about you
and something you did,

26:35.115 --> 26:36.246
something you wouldn't want
getting out.

26:36.290 --> 26:38.074
They never
found the body.

26:38.118 --> 26:39.859
Okay. Joan said
only three people

26:39.902 --> 26:41.817
know about the book:
Kristy, Chad and Whitehead.

26:41.861 --> 26:44.341
But Kristy never met with
Whitehead, so he doesn't know.

26:44.385 --> 26:45.691
But Brophy might not know that.

26:45.734 --> 26:47.867
We need to warn Whitehead.

26:47.910 --> 26:50.957
While you're doing that,
I'll listen in on some calls.

26:52.872 --> 26:54.264
LIZZIE: This is bad.DYLAN: What is?

26:54.308 --> 26:57.398
Julian tapping
Brophy's phone.

26:57.441 --> 26:59.661
Jasmine asked me how
I get my information.

26:59.705 --> 27:00.531
If it's aboveboard.

27:00.575 --> 27:02.142
I-I told her it was.

27:02.185 --> 27:03.622
I lied.

27:03.665 --> 27:05.711
She wants you
to reveal your sources.

27:05.754 --> 27:07.669
If you do, it's your career.
If you don't...

27:07.713 --> 27:09.192
I'm not
exposing you.

27:09.236 --> 27:10.367
Or Julian.

27:10.411 --> 27:11.891
A delicate situation.

27:11.934 --> 27:13.196
Okay, listen.

27:13.240 --> 27:15.068
All this gray-area stuff
that we've been doing,

27:15.111 --> 27:16.809
it was a mistake.

27:16.852 --> 27:19.246
All this gray-area stuff
has saved a lot of lives

27:19.289 --> 27:20.900
and put away
a lot of bad guys.

27:20.943 --> 27:21.683
That's not the point.

27:21.727 --> 27:22.945
Maybe it should be.

27:22.989 --> 27:24.338
Those people who killed
Kristy and Chad,

27:24.381 --> 27:25.905
you think they're playing
by the rules?

27:29.778 --> 27:33.216
Mr. Whitehead, have you heard
of a man named Tony Holt?

27:33.260 --> 27:34.870
Not to my recollection, no.

27:34.914 --> 27:37.743
Kristy and Chad are both dead.

27:37.786 --> 27:39.788
And they were both
connected to this book.

27:39.832 --> 27:43.618
The only other person who knows
anything about it is you.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.054
Dylan, I told you
everything I know,

27:45.098 --> 27:46.316
and it's insignificant.

27:46.360 --> 27:48.188
Yeah, but the killer
may not know that.

27:48.231 --> 27:50.712
You think the killer
is coming after me?

27:50.756 --> 27:52.932
LIZZIE: Can you give
us any good reason

27:52.975 --> 27:54.977
why that wouldn't be the case?

27:55.021 --> 27:56.196
WHITEHEAD:
Well, we have published

27:56.239 --> 27:57.937
some controversial works
during my tenure.

27:57.980 --> 27:59.721
Uh, I survived
the Rushdie fatwa

27:59.765 --> 28:01.418
and a few other
outrageous threats.

28:01.462 --> 28:04.900
Obviously, I would prefer
not to be murdered,

28:04.944 --> 28:07.468
but I'm not about
to live my life in hiding.

28:07.511 --> 28:08.774
Nor should you, Charles.

28:08.817 --> 28:10.950
I'm sure you've had enough
of secrecy.

28:13.387 --> 28:15.606
Dylan, I-I'm a fan

28:15.650 --> 28:17.130
of your unique
and brilliant mind.

28:17.173 --> 28:18.653
I'm just not
following your point.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.307
Oh. I'm sorry
if I was being obtuse.

28:20.350 --> 28:21.874
Lambsmen.

28:21.917 --> 28:23.702
Secret society.

28:23.745 --> 28:26.008
Concannon and Brophy
are members,

28:26.052 --> 28:28.228
and I think Chad
may have been, too.

28:28.271 --> 28:31.318
Brothers will do anything
to protect each other.

28:31.361 --> 28:34.625
Even at the cost
of rationality or morality.

28:34.669 --> 28:35.975
Why are you telling me this?

28:36.018 --> 28:38.281
Because I wondered if you
might be a member, too.

28:42.808 --> 28:44.766
Closest I ever came
was the glee club.

28:46.202 --> 28:48.074
I promise, if I hear anything
about this book,

28:48.117 --> 28:50.119
I will let you know.

28:50.163 --> 28:52.121
I will also fight
to get it published.

28:52.165 --> 28:56.604
I can't think of a better
tribute I could give to Kristy.

28:56.647 --> 28:59.346
Even posthumously, yes.

29:01.130 --> 29:03.785
His cufflinks had
the number "322" on them.

29:03.829 --> 29:05.744
Oh. I couldn't even
begin to guess.

29:05.787 --> 29:09.704
Lambsmen sometimes wear items
with the number "322" on them,

29:09.748 --> 29:11.793
and it's become the
sacred number of the group.

29:11.837 --> 29:13.708
No one knows why,
but my theory

29:13.752 --> 29:17.233
is that it refers
to Genesis 3:22, which reads,

29:17.277 --> 29:20.541
"And God said man has now
become like us."

29:20.584 --> 29:22.412
Quite an ego
on these guys.

29:22.456 --> 29:25.198
Mm-hmm. Tribal bonds
run very deep.

29:25.241 --> 29:27.896
That could be why
Whitehead wasn't nervous

29:27.940 --> 29:30.116
about being the
killer's next target.

29:30.159 --> 29:31.770
He's in on it.

29:31.813 --> 29:33.772
Kristy told Whitehead
about the book,

29:33.815 --> 29:35.512
and because they're in
the same brotherhood,

29:35.556 --> 29:37.340
Whitehead warned
Concannon and Brophy.

29:41.562 --> 29:43.520
JULIAN :
Whitehead called Concannon

29:43.564 --> 29:45.566
in a panic
right after you left him.

29:45.609 --> 29:48.047
He said they know about Tony
and the book.

29:48.090 --> 29:49.962
That things have gone
way too far.

29:50.005 --> 29:51.659
Talk later.

29:51.702 --> 29:54.662
We have got to get
into that tribe.

29:54.705 --> 29:57.578
If Whitehead and Concannon
are communicating,

29:57.621 --> 30:00.146
Brophy may be our weak link.

30:00.189 --> 30:01.277
The police looked into

30:01.321 --> 30:02.975
Tony's disappearance
15 years ago.

30:03.018 --> 30:04.454
They didn't find anything.

30:04.498 --> 30:07.283
Maybe Concannon had
something to do with that.

30:07.327 --> 30:09.198
Bobby didn't do anything
to Tony.

30:09.242 --> 30:10.069
We were brothers.

30:10.112 --> 30:11.374
We think otherwise.

30:11.418 --> 30:13.115
We think that's what
the book's about.

30:13.159 --> 30:14.900
It tells the
story of Tony.

30:16.249 --> 30:18.381
I get that you're
doing your job,

30:18.425 --> 30:21.080
and the desire
for this mystery book

30:21.123 --> 30:22.559
to solve these crimes,

30:22.603 --> 30:24.910
but Bobby Concannon
is not a murderer.

30:24.953 --> 30:27.129
He's a man of integrity.

30:27.173 --> 30:29.218
Whatever you have
is circumstantial,

30:29.262 --> 30:30.829
and you know it.

30:30.872 --> 30:33.483
You're fishing,
and there's nothing in the lake.

30:33.527 --> 30:35.616
Maybe you're right.

30:35.659 --> 30:37.966
Maybe it wasn't Bobby.

30:38.010 --> 30:39.707
Maybe it was you.

30:39.750 --> 30:41.796
You seem very
confident.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.973
That's how people behave
when they're telling the truth.

30:45.017 --> 30:46.540
Unlike when they're not.

30:46.583 --> 30:51.240
For example, if I were
to be considering adoption

30:51.284 --> 30:53.982
and reassuring
my husband

30:54.026 --> 30:55.418
that it was something I wanted,

30:55.462 --> 30:57.420
when I knew deep in my gut
that it wasn't.

30:57.464 --> 30:59.074
That I didn't think
I could handle it,

30:59.118 --> 31:00.902
but I didn't know
how to tell him.

31:00.946 --> 31:05.080
You could find a coward
like that pretty easily, I bet.

31:05.124 --> 31:08.910
See, there's an emptiness
inside such a person.

31:08.954 --> 31:11.695
Maybe it's from having
an absent father

31:11.739 --> 31:13.697
who clearly didn't care
about him very much.

31:13.741 --> 31:17.919
And he would think
that adopting a baby now

31:17.963 --> 31:19.921
might fill that void,

31:19.965 --> 31:21.662
but he'd know deep down

31:21.705 --> 31:23.620
that he'd make
a terrible father.

31:23.664 --> 31:25.535
Jumping from career to career--

31:25.579 --> 31:28.930
CIA, teacher, author, NYPD--

31:28.974 --> 31:31.019
just to find some place
where he's accepted.

31:31.063 --> 31:32.455
But that's never gonna happen

31:32.499 --> 31:34.196
because you will never
accept yourself.

31:34.240 --> 31:36.329
That's enough.And know this.

31:36.372 --> 31:37.591
I have nothing to hide,

31:37.634 --> 31:39.985
but if you come after me
or Bobby unjustly,

31:40.028 --> 31:42.639
I will do whatever
is in my power to stop you.

31:42.683 --> 31:45.686
I will make public
every single shred of your life.

31:45.729 --> 31:47.601
I said that's enough.

31:50.909 --> 31:54.434
If we're giving out advice here,
I'd say ditch your partner.

31:54.477 --> 31:56.566
He's a weak link,

31:56.610 --> 31:58.220
and if I've learned
one thing in my career,

31:58.264 --> 32:00.701
you gotta weed those out.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.617
They'll bring you down.

32:05.619 --> 32:07.664
Now, if you're not
going to arrest me,

32:07.708 --> 32:09.318
I've got a business to run.

32:11.755 --> 32:13.757
LIZZIE: Why did you let him
talk to you like that?

32:13.801 --> 32:14.976
You want me
to fight back?

32:15.020 --> 32:16.151
That was brutal.

32:16.195 --> 32:17.892
You see brutal,
I see enlightening.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.633
It wasn't enough
for him to hold power.

32:19.676 --> 32:22.070
He had to prove to me
how powerful he is.

32:22.114 --> 32:24.551
And in so doing,
he showed me his cards.

32:24.594 --> 32:26.857
We've got to get
back to Whitehead.
Why?

32:26.901 --> 32:29.077
When Brophy warned about
getting rid of the weak links,

32:29.121 --> 32:30.687
I don't think he
was referring to me.

32:30.731 --> 32:32.559
I think he was talking
about his next victim.

32:38.826 --> 32:40.523
Oh.

32:40.567 --> 32:42.264
Damn.

32:42.308 --> 32:44.223
Oh, my God. He's alive.

32:56.800 --> 32:57.888
I got it.

32:57.932 --> 32:59.368
Yeah. Good, good.

32:59.412 --> 33:01.544
Okay, sit him down.
Come here.

33:01.588 --> 33:03.285
Okay. Breathe.

33:03.329 --> 33:04.721
Breathe. Come on.

33:04.765 --> 33:05.809
Take a deep breath. Deep.

33:05.853 --> 33:08.029
That's it. Okay.

33:08.073 --> 33:09.204
Okay.

33:15.515 --> 33:16.603
You got lucky.

33:16.646 --> 33:20.607
But you may not again.
Give us the book.

33:20.650 --> 33:21.216
I can't.

33:21.260 --> 33:22.261
Why not?

33:22.304 --> 33:23.523
There is no book.

33:25.046 --> 33:28.136
And believe me,
I looked everywhere for it.

33:28.180 --> 33:30.225
Kristy pitched it to me,

33:30.269 --> 33:32.053
but she never handed me
anything.

33:32.097 --> 33:34.490
So all I know
is what she told me--

33:34.534 --> 33:38.494
how Concannon and-and Brophy
killed someone

33:38.538 --> 33:41.367
15 years ago and
got away with it.

33:41.410 --> 33:44.631
So I reached
out to them,

33:44.674 --> 33:47.721
as Lambsmen,
to protect the club.

33:49.462 --> 33:52.030
I thought that there
being no book, that was good.

33:52.073 --> 33:54.989
The story wouldn't get out.

33:55.033 --> 33:59.211
I did not know
they were going to kill them.

34:01.256 --> 34:04.564
He told me he was
just going to scare them,

34:04.607 --> 34:06.479
like he threatened me.

34:06.522 --> 34:07.480
Who?

34:07.523 --> 34:10.265
Concannon, Brophy.

34:10.309 --> 34:12.093
I don't know.

34:12.137 --> 34:14.269
They're inseparable.

34:16.619 --> 34:18.534
I'm Bobby Concannon.

34:20.493 --> 34:22.582
What will tomorrow's skyline
look like?

34:22.625 --> 34:25.672
New York is not static.
It evolves with the times.

34:25.715 --> 34:27.543
And as it does,
we need to make it

34:27.587 --> 34:29.023
and all our cities
more inclusive

34:29.067 --> 34:31.634
so that all residents,
rich and poor,

34:31.678 --> 34:35.334
have fair and equal
economic opportunities.

34:37.771 --> 34:40.252
Uh, can you
give me a minute?

34:40.295 --> 34:41.601
LIZZIE: We read the book.What book?

34:41.644 --> 34:42.906
DYLAN:
It tells the whole story,

34:42.950 --> 34:44.647
and it is going to be published.

34:44.691 --> 34:46.910
You killed Kristy.
You killed Chad.

34:46.954 --> 34:48.825
You killed Tony.

34:48.869 --> 34:51.654
Your buddy Brophy confirmed it,
and he is willing to testify.

34:51.698 --> 34:54.048
So, where do your
loyalties lie now?

34:54.092 --> 34:57.704
With your Lambsmen family
or with your real family?

35:00.663 --> 35:03.362
I didn't kill Tony that night.

35:03.405 --> 35:05.015
Brophy did.

35:06.974 --> 35:08.715
We were drunk.

35:08.758 --> 35:11.935
Brophy pushed him,
and Tony hit his head on a rock.

35:11.979 --> 35:15.156
I wanted to call 911.
So did Chad.

35:15.200 --> 35:18.203
But Brophy insisted we bury Tony

35:18.246 --> 35:20.379
and made us swear
we'd never mention it.

35:20.422 --> 35:22.555
Said it would ruin
our lives.

35:23.425 --> 35:27.125
Besides, he said,
Tony wasn't really one of us.

35:27.168 --> 35:29.518
He was just a scholarship kid
with no real pedigree.

35:31.216 --> 35:32.869
Chad and I argued that people
would notice he's missing

35:32.913 --> 35:34.871
and start asking questions.

35:34.915 --> 35:36.438
Brophy said he'd handle it.

35:36.482 --> 35:39.006
Next thing we knew,
the cops never questioned us.

35:39.049 --> 35:42.357
When we found out
Chad was writing a book,

35:42.401 --> 35:44.316
I wanted to come clean,
but Brophy threatened me,

35:44.359 --> 35:45.491
my family.

35:46.709 --> 35:48.276
I have been sick
over the fact

35:48.320 --> 35:51.671
that two innocent people
have been killed over this book.

35:51.714 --> 35:53.281
Almost three.

35:53.325 --> 35:55.022
Whitehead?

35:55.065 --> 35:56.154
Mm-hmm.

35:58.243 --> 36:00.288
I understand
my guilt in this,

36:00.332 --> 36:02.508
but know...

36:02.551 --> 36:04.640
I'll testify against him.

36:05.728 --> 36:07.600
I'll tell the truth.

36:09.428 --> 36:11.517
I can't live with this anymore.

36:12.866 --> 36:14.607
Last quarter looks beautiful,
my friends.

36:14.650 --> 36:17.566
Very nice work.
Now, moving on...

36:17.610 --> 36:19.394
You can't just barge in here.

36:19.438 --> 36:21.614
Actually, we can.
We're the police.

36:21.657 --> 36:23.093
Get out of here.Tucker Brophy,

36:23.137 --> 36:24.312
you're under arrest for murder.

36:24.356 --> 36:25.357
DYLAN:
A word of advice:

36:25.400 --> 36:27.533
Ditch your boss.

36:27.576 --> 36:28.838
He's a weak link.

36:28.882 --> 36:30.840
And if I've learned
one thing in my career,

36:30.884 --> 36:33.234
you gotta weed those out.

36:33.278 --> 36:35.105
They'll bring you down.

36:36.411 --> 36:38.631
You have the right to remain
silent. Anything you say

36:38.674 --> 36:42.461
can and will be used against
you in a court of law.

36:42.504 --> 36:44.376
KRISTY'S MOTHER:
Kristy sent me Chad's book.

36:44.419 --> 36:48.206
It came today. She must have
known how dangerous it was.

36:49.294 --> 36:51.339
Kristy was very smart.

36:51.383 --> 36:52.819
I'm sure it'll be
the best seller

36:52.862 --> 36:54.342
she knew it would be.

36:54.386 --> 36:56.344
I loved my girl so much.

36:56.388 --> 36:59.173
I'm gonna make sure people
know about this book.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.783
Gonna make her proud.

37:01.871 --> 37:04.526
Thank you both so much.

37:09.531 --> 37:11.533
You're very welcome.

37:23.632 --> 37:26.069
You're gonna be
a great father, too.

37:26.113 --> 37:29.377
All that stuff Brophy said
is not true.

37:31.031 --> 37:33.816
Not all of it was, but...

37:33.860 --> 37:36.558
some of it is.

37:36.602 --> 37:38.908
I do jump from profession
to profession.

37:40.997 --> 37:43.261
I do have emptiness.

37:44.523 --> 37:46.568
And I don't know what a home is.

37:46.612 --> 37:47.743
Yes, you do.
You and Andy built one.

37:47.787 --> 37:48.744
I've been there.

37:48.788 --> 37:51.399
You're gonna be
a great father.

37:51.443 --> 37:53.836
Any child, whether it's
next week or next year,

37:53.880 --> 37:57.013
would be lucky as hell to have
you and Andy as their dads.

37:59.015 --> 38:00.669
It's gonna be six months
before the agency

38:00.713 --> 38:02.628
gives us another meeting
with a social worker.

38:02.671 --> 38:04.978
Well, just imagine
how ready you'll be then.

38:05.021 --> 38:07.894
And we all have an emptiness.

38:07.937 --> 38:10.592
It might make us feel abnormal,

38:10.636 --> 38:12.507
but isn't being abnormal normal?

38:12.551 --> 38:15.293
You taught me that,
and it's helped me.

38:15.336 --> 38:18.383
You've helped me
more than you know.

38:18.426 --> 38:21.473
Well, knowing you,
you probably already know that.

38:21.516 --> 38:23.562
Are you calling me
a know

38:23.605 --> 38:25.912
I think we both know
the answer to that.

38:26.956 --> 38:28.349
I gotta walk Gary.

38:28.393 --> 38:29.785
You heading out?

38:29.829 --> 38:32.310
Uh, no, no,
I need a couple of minutes.

38:32.353 --> 38:33.354
Okay.

38:33.398 --> 38:34.790
See you in the morning.

38:34.834 --> 38:35.922
Lizzie.

38:37.402 --> 38:40.318
You've helped me.

38:40.361 --> 38:42.058
Thanks.

38:42.102 --> 38:44.278
You'll make it up to me.

38:55.550 --> 38:56.943
Lieutenant,
do you have a moment?

39:00.555 --> 39:02.296
I know you've asked Lizzie
questions

39:02.340 --> 39:04.342
about her sources
on the Montgomery case.

39:04.385 --> 39:06.344
With good reason.

39:07.519 --> 39:09.347
I have to come clean.

39:11.784 --> 39:13.916
I may have mentioned
to a well-placed friend

39:13.960 --> 39:16.397
that we weren't sure which
address was accurate,

39:16.441 --> 39:19.052
and if he had to guess,
what he would say.

39:19.922 --> 39:22.534
That friend gave us
the correct information.

39:22.577 --> 39:26.059
But Lizzie was
kept in the dark.

39:26.102 --> 39:29.105
When she asked, I...

39:29.149 --> 39:32.848
I lied to her and made up
a legitimate source.

39:34.415 --> 39:37.462
So, if Lizzie's in trouble,
it is not her fault.

39:37.505 --> 39:38.811
It's mine.

39:38.854 --> 39:40.378
And if I have acted improperly,

39:40.421 --> 39:43.424
you should not punish Lizzie
for my mistake.

39:46.122 --> 39:47.907
You should fire me.

39:47.950 --> 39:50.126
I may very well do that.

Jasmine called.

40:57.019 --> 40:58.978
Said I was
off the hook.

40:59.021 --> 41:01.067
You didn't have
to do that.

I only did it because I owe you.

As for you and Julian sharing

it's none of your business?

More importantly,
I could lose working with you.

I don't know if I'm ready

42:05.261 --> 42:07.655
Julian is
a pretty special guy.

42:09.178 --> 42:11.964
Though, if you did
lose your job,

42:12.007 --> 42:13.792
I'd get a new partner.

42:13.835 --> 42:16.316
And although
I'm sure she or he

42:16.359 --> 42:20.015
would be nothing
compared to you,

42:20.059 --> 42:22.017
that would make me
the senior partner.

42:22.061 --> 42:23.323
Senior partner?

42:23.366 --> 42:24.759
You may not have a job.

42:24.803 --> 42:26.413
You don't even have a badge.

42:27.936 --> 42:30.330
Seriously,
I've been meaning to ask you--

42:30.373 --> 42:31.853
how do I get a badge?

42:33.159 --> 42:34.421
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe, um...

42:34.464 --> 42:35.727
join the police academy.

42:35.770 --> 42:39.644
What, four degrees
and a PhD isn't enough?

42:39.687 --> 42:40.949
Nope.
