00:08.925 --> 00:12.315
Hello, Doug, this is Dr Frasier Crane.
I'm listening.

00:12.637 --> 00:16.789
'It's about my mother. She's getting on
now and she hasn't much of a life.

00:17.142 --> 00:20.020
'She doesn't want to do anything,
go anywhere.

00:20.311 --> 00:24.509
'She literally hangs around the house
all day. It is very frustrating.'

00:24.858 --> 00:26.974
Can we go back for a second?

00:27.235 --> 00:31.353
You said your mother "literally"
hangs around the house.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.654
It's my pet peeve:

00:33.908 --> 00:37.139
you mean she figuratively
hangs around the house.

00:37.454 --> 00:39.410
To literally hang around the house

00:39.664 --> 00:42.098
you'd have to be
a bat or a spider monkey.

00:44.377 --> 00:48.086
- 'Can I tell you my pet peeve?'
- Sure.

00:48.423 --> 00:53.861
'l hate intellectuals with superiority
complexes who nitpick your grammar

00:54.262 --> 00:57.220
'when you ask for help.
That's what I've got a problem with.'

01:00.894 --> 01:02.850
I think what he means is,

01:03.104 --> 01:06.414
"that is a thing,
with which he has a problem."

01:09.694 --> 01:11.650
It's time for a station break.

01:11.905 --> 01:16.660
We'll be back after this message
from "Pizza, Pizza, Pizza".

01:17.952 --> 01:20.068
Wanna hear my pet peeve?

01:20.330 --> 01:25.040
You're in a store, the clerk
is helping you and the phone rings.

01:25.418 --> 01:28.808
So he starts taking care of them.

01:29.130 --> 01:33.043
You go, "l came here in person,
while some joker at home

01:33.385 --> 01:37.219
"in his underwear is getting
first-rate service." Don't you hate that?

01:37.555 --> 01:40.547
Actually, I do most of my shopping
by phone.

01:42.102 --> 01:45.014
This got me thinking about my father.

01:45.313 --> 01:47.304
He doesn't do much, either.

01:47.565 --> 01:52.559
He just sits around watching TV
or doing the occasional crossword.

01:52.946 --> 01:57.736
- What does your mother do?
- Wisconsin Attorney General.

01:58.118 --> 02:01.315
- No, really?
- Really.

02:03.248 --> 02:06.206
Oh... I guess that helps fill her day.

02:06.501 --> 02:10.858
She says, "Crime never stops,
even in the dairy state."

02:12.257 --> 02:15.215
I don't think public office
is for Dad, but...

02:15.510 --> 02:19.139
Maybe I can find him a hobby.
Any suggestions?

02:19.472 --> 02:24.387
Mom likes to water-ski a little.
She hikes, oil paints...

02:24.769 --> 02:29.968
Oh, she likes archaeology.
She's on a dig in Honduras right now.

02:30.358 --> 02:33.873
Well, maybe I could get him
a wood-burning set.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.654
Is Dad still asleep?

02:38.908 --> 02:42.344
Yes, with the dog.
Eddie's legs are going like mad.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.618
He's dreaming of chasing rabbits.

02:44.873 --> 02:47.592
But why is your father twitching?

02:49.002 --> 02:51.232
Just about done with this thing.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.620
Your dad will love it.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.873
I was walking through the hobby shop.

02:56.134 --> 02:59.206
It was "Eureka!"
I actually said, "Eureka!"

03:02.682 --> 03:06.516
Ah, yes. There are a million stories
in the naked city.

03:06.853 --> 03:10.482
Now, if we could just find a naked one.

03:10.815 --> 03:16.651
Dr Crane! You naughty boy!
Peeking in on other people's privacy!

03:18.698 --> 03:20.973
If people were concerned
about their privacy,

03:21.242 --> 03:23.836
would they leave their blinds open

03:24.120 --> 03:28.796
where you can see the mantel mirror
that reflects to the waterbed?

03:29.167 --> 03:32.239
Your father's coming.
Stand in front of it.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.615
We'll make this a surprise.

03:34.881 --> 03:38.078
- Hi, guys.
- How was your nap?

03:38.385 --> 03:40.740
I had the strangest dream.

03:41.012 --> 03:43.446
A woman with bad breath
was licking my face.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.540
Hey, where'd you just come from?

03:51.481 --> 03:53.358
I got a surprise for you.

03:54.943 --> 03:59.380
Hey, a telescope! That's a beaut!
What's the occasion?

03:59.739 --> 04:03.129
- I just thought you'd like it.
- That's great, thanks!

04:03.451 --> 04:06.124
I saw on the news,
there's a bunch of falcons

04:06.413 --> 04:08.244
on the Columbia Tower.

04:08.498 --> 04:11.217
- I can watch them from here.
- Forget the falcons.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.969
You can see everything in that building.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.212
I'd lock people up for that.

04:17.507 --> 04:22.058
It's innocent. Just think of it as having
like 100 more channels to watch.

04:23.722 --> 04:26.156
Just look,
people going about their lives.

04:26.433 --> 04:29.186
There's an old couple watching telly.

04:29.477 --> 04:34.267
Next door, an attractive young woman
is working at a computer,

04:34.649 --> 04:38.767
while below her a burly man
is sopping up a large pool of blood.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.989
- Oh, God!
- What?

04:41.239 --> 04:43.150
Oh, Daddy!

04:44.617 --> 04:47.415
Nah, that's tomato juice,
you can see the can.

04:48.788 --> 04:54.146
- Yes, she is a looker!
- There's a voyeur in all of us.

04:54.544 --> 04:59.254
Let's see what else
the Seattle skyline has to offer.

04:59.632 --> 05:03.864
I say we make a strict rule. If anybody
does anything nasty, we move on.

05:04.220 --> 05:06.450
Agreed?

05:06.723 --> 05:08.679
I said "agreed"?

05:08.933 --> 05:10.969
Yeah.

05:12.312 --> 05:16.225
There's a lady with a telescope
looking back at us!

05:16.566 --> 05:19.444
- What shall we do?
- Hide!

05:22.697 --> 05:25.165
Every time I do something bad,
I get caught!

05:25.450 --> 05:28.408
Hi! How you doing?

05:29.454 --> 05:31.410
What are you doing?

05:31.665 --> 05:34.259
- She's waving, I'm waving back.
- Don't do that.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.897
Why not?
Wait, she's writing something!

05:37.170 --> 05:39.126
She's holding it up.

05:39.381 --> 05:42.100
It says, "Hello, there, stranger."

05:42.384 --> 05:45.421
- Daphne, get me that pad and pen!
- What for?

05:45.720 --> 05:49.315
I'll answer her.
Write down, "My name is Martin."

05:49.641 --> 05:54.032
You shouldn't encourage her.
I don't want people looking in on us.

05:54.396 --> 05:56.626
I don't think I made my bed today.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.854
Is she writing anything else?

05:59.109 --> 06:03.466
- Yeah... "My name is Irene."
- Her name's Irene.

06:03.822 --> 06:07.258
- Thank you.
- Wait, she's writing something else!

06:07.575 --> 06:12.490
"Is that Dr Crane from the radio
hiding there behind you?"

06:12.872 --> 06:15.261
It does not say that!

06:16.543 --> 06:19.103
Oh, it does say that!

06:22.007 --> 06:22.962
Hello!

06:25.885 --> 06:29.764
- Her oldest son is an accountant.
- He was the breech birth?

06:30.098 --> 06:33.408
- No, that's the dentist in Boise.
- Oh, right.

06:33.727 --> 06:37.003
He's got the wife that won't let him visit.
I can't stand her.

06:38.523 --> 06:42.482
Morning, Dad, Daphne.
Morning, Irene.

06:42.819 --> 06:47.654
When you were a kid, what was that
skin condition you had on your butt?

06:48.033 --> 06:50.911
Pityriasis rosea.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.158
- How do you spell that?
- Why?

06:53.413 --> 06:55.768
Irene and l
are exchanging family histories.

06:56.041 --> 07:00.239
- Don't tell your girlfriend about that.
- She's not my girlfriend!

07:00.587 --> 07:03.784
You've been exchanging notes
for the last three days.

07:04.090 --> 07:08.242
If you were in the sixth grade,
you'd be sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g.

07:09.596 --> 07:13.350
- Let me borrow that pad.
- What are you doing?

07:13.683 --> 07:15.878
I'm going to help along
your little romance

07:16.144 --> 07:19.659
and maybe save a small forest.

07:19.981 --> 07:23.371
- I'm giving her our number.
- No, don't do that!

07:23.693 --> 07:26.207
- Why?
- She'll think I'm being too forward.

07:26.488 --> 07:29.161
You met peeping into her apartment.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.440
She won't call.

07:31.701 --> 07:33.657
- Want to bet?
- Yeah, five bucks.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.425
(Phone)

07:37.290 --> 07:39.440
- Aren't you going to answer it?
- You get it.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.667
Dad, it's for you.

07:47.425 --> 07:52.294
Hello? No, no, this is Frasier, hi.
I'm fine.

07:52.681 --> 07:54.399
It, uh...

07:54.641 --> 07:57.553
gets a little flaky
when the weather is dry.

08:00.355 --> 08:03.188
- Tell her I'm not home!
- She knows you're home.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.951
She can see you through the telescope.

08:06.236 --> 08:10.787
- Come on, you're just a little nervous.
- Hello?

08:12.158 --> 08:14.467
Hi...

08:14.744 --> 08:16.974
Yeah, it's nice hearing yours.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.076
Can you hold on a minute?

08:22.085 --> 08:24.474
Would you two get out of here?

08:27.924 --> 08:30.233
I'm getting a very good
feeling about this.

08:30.510 --> 08:36.107
- You really think he's interested in her?
- Yes, I think so.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.666
Do you want to hear something cute?

08:38.934 --> 08:41.654
I made him this rich coffee cake.

08:41.938 --> 08:45.772
You know what a sweet tooth he has.
And he wouldn't even take one bite,

08:46.109 --> 08:50.819
because as he put it, "Women
don't like a spare tyre on a man."

08:52.032 --> 08:54.182
That's so cute.

08:54.451 --> 08:57.409
Oh, it's funny.
The twists and turns of fate.

08:57.704 --> 09:01.379
If I had tried to set Dad up
with a woman, he would've refused.

09:01.708 --> 09:05.417
But I go out, get him a telescope
and it kindles this romance.

09:05.754 --> 09:08.314
It's kismet.

09:10.000 --> 09:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:17.140 --> 09:19.973
- Well?
- What?

09:20.268 --> 09:22.259
- What happened?
- We talked.

09:22.520 --> 09:26.559
Was she nice, interesting?
What did she say?

09:26.900 --> 09:31.610
- A lot of stuff.
- So, you'll be seeing each other?

09:31.988 --> 09:35.105
- She wanted to, but I said no.
- Why?

09:35.408 --> 09:37.364
She's not my type.

09:37.619 --> 09:40.213
Oh, coffee cake!

09:40.497 --> 09:42.613
We got any butter around here?

09:47.337 --> 09:51.694
You know the pompous twit
who's president of my wine club?

09:52.050 --> 09:56.840
At the meeting, I convinced my fellow
psychiatrists to play a prank on him.

09:57.222 --> 09:59.531
Thinking he was tasting
a Château Petrus,

09:59.808 --> 10:01.878
he was in fact
sipping a Fourcas-Dupré.

10:04.145 --> 10:09.344
- You see, we'd switched the labels.
- What scamps you are.

10:09.734 --> 10:13.932
There he was, proclaiming the Petrus
to be the superior wine,

10:14.280 --> 10:16.475
and none of us
could contain our laughter.

10:16.741 --> 10:22.099
His face must have turned redder
than a Pichon-Longueville.

10:22.497 --> 10:27.525
Of course, as so often happens,
roughhouse turns to tears.

10:30.880 --> 10:34.873
At the end of the evening,
he tendered his resignation.

10:35.218 --> 10:37.174
That must have ruined the evening.

10:37.429 --> 10:42.583
- Not really, I'm the new president.
- Kudos, indeed.

10:42.976 --> 10:47.811
Oh! Are Dad and his lady friend
still playing telescope footsie?

10:48.189 --> 10:52.501
- What was her name?
- Irene. No, they've broken it off.

10:52.861 --> 10:55.375
Already? I thought it was going well.

10:55.655 --> 10:59.773
It was, then they spoke once
and then Dad said she wasn't his type.

11:00.118 --> 11:03.076
It's over. He's cut her out of his life.

11:03.371 --> 11:05.726
I just don't understand why he did that.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.955
Who knows
why anybody does anything?

11:08.209 --> 11:10.882
Remind me again
what you do for a living.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.773
It was one phone call.

11:15.050 --> 11:19.202
How can you make a judgment
about someone from one phone call?

11:19.554 --> 11:22.148
Remind me again
what you do for a living.

11:23.975 --> 11:29.925
I suppose it could be any number
of reasons - fear of rejection, shyness...

11:30.357 --> 11:34.714
Maybe she just wasn't his type.
If only we knew someone who was.

11:35.070 --> 11:39.302
I know! Maris's lovely Aunt Patrice
is in town visiting from Washington DC.

11:39.657 --> 11:42.251
Maybe we should set Dad up with her?

11:42.535 --> 11:45.493
I've met Aunt Patrice. She's a loon.

11:45.789 --> 11:48.064
Do this for me.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.403
When Aunt Patrice visits, Maris dives

11:50.669 --> 11:53.467
under the duvet
with a two-week migraine,

11:53.755 --> 11:57.225
and I'm left holding the bag,
literally and figuratively.

11:57.550 --> 12:02.340
No, I don't think so.
I know Dad. Don't meddle.

12:02.722 --> 12:07.273
- At least say hello to Aunt Patrice.
- I'm not driving out there.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.953
She's out in the car.

12:10.230 --> 12:13.859
- You left her in the car?
- I cracked open a window.

12:14.192 --> 12:16.183
Oh, then she's fine.

12:19.280 --> 12:22.192
No, calm down, son.
Listen to Daddy.

12:22.492 --> 12:25.848
It's just a bad dream, I promise you.

12:26.162 --> 12:29.677
Senator Thurmond is not in your closet.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.946
That's a good boy. All right.

12:34.212 --> 12:37.727
You go back to bed now...
I love you, too.

12:38.049 --> 12:41.359
I'll see you next weekend.
OK, bye-bye.

12:42.637 --> 12:45.674
- How's Freddy?
- He's fine.

12:45.974 --> 12:48.966
He thanks you
for the toy gun you gave him.

12:49.269 --> 12:54.184
Or what he can remember of it before
Lilith smashed it with a croquet mallet.

12:54.566 --> 12:59.003
Oh, it's such a beautiful night.
The city is lit up like a jewel.

12:59.362 --> 13:01.478
Oh, look, there's Irene!

13:01.740 --> 13:04.971
She's sitting in her window
wearing a stunning green dress.

13:06.202 --> 13:09.160
But her face... It's so sad!

13:12.167 --> 13:14.920
Oh... Oh, she's holding a note.

13:17.005 --> 13:20.395
It says,
"Martin, was it something I wrote?"

13:20.717 --> 13:24.551
Will you cut it out.
Irene is not sitting in her window!

13:24.888 --> 13:26.844
All right, but she might as well be.

13:27.098 --> 13:28.497
(Doorbell)

13:28.725 --> 13:33.435
- Ever met a woman who's not the one?
- Yes. Five years after I married her.

13:34.272 --> 13:36.228
Hello, there Frasier.

13:36.483 --> 13:39.555
Niles! I was specifically
not expecting you.

13:41.446 --> 13:43.402
You remember Aunt Patrice?

13:43.656 --> 13:45.612
Of course, Aunt Patrice.

13:45.867 --> 13:47.937
I don't recall when we met,

13:48.203 --> 13:50.273
but I remember
a lot of laughing, dancing.

13:50.538 --> 13:54.133
- My husband's funeral.
- Yes! Of course!

13:54.459 --> 13:56.973
Of course,
the laughter was to hide our tears.

13:57.253 --> 14:01.132
- Let me take your wrap.
- We were driving and I thought,

14:01.466 --> 14:06.221
"We're just a couple of short ferry rides
from Frasier's." So...

14:07.555 --> 14:09.750
...we decided to pop over.

14:10.016 --> 14:13.326
Is this the charming gentleman
you were talking about?

14:13.645 --> 14:16.921
You bloodhound,
you've treed another one.

14:17.232 --> 14:19.223
Yes, this is my dad.

14:19.484 --> 14:22.715
How are you, Patrice?
I'm Martin Crane, this is Daphne Moon.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.065
- Nice to meet you.
- Please.

14:25.323 --> 14:28.872
What brings you to Seattle?
I came to see Maris,

14:29.202 --> 14:33.878
but she's taken to her bed again.
I still have no idea how tall she is.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.838
Patrice and I've had a great time.

14:40.130 --> 14:44.203
If you call sitting in your waiting room
reading old magazines a great time,

14:44.551 --> 14:46.587
then, yes, we had a laugh riot.

14:48.388 --> 14:52.301
Now I know where Maris
gets her sense of humour.

14:52.642 --> 14:56.521
Why don't I pop in the kitchen
and get us all some refreshments.

14:56.855 --> 14:59.733
A capital idea.
We'll join you and give these kids

15:00.025 --> 15:01.981
time to get to know one another.

15:03.236 --> 15:06.990
- I told you not to bring her here.
- I ran out of ways to entertain her.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.712
We went to the arboretum,
a fashion show,

15:09.993 --> 15:14.191
we even spat off the top of the Space
Needle. I'm sorry, I cracked.

15:18.460 --> 15:20.416
That woman is not Dad's type.

15:20.670 --> 15:25.266
You never know when love can bloom
between two different people. Daphne?

15:25.633 --> 15:28.591
I never thought opposites attract.

15:28.887 --> 15:31.003
Neither do I. We're alike.

15:31.264 --> 15:35.735
- We can't leave Dad alone with her.
- I'm sure they're doing fine.

15:36.102 --> 15:39.299
D'go y'gou sp'geak g'g-speak'g?

15:39.606 --> 15:41.881
- I was afraid of this.
- What?

15:42.150 --> 15:44.710
D'go y'gou sp'geak g'g-speak'g?

15:44.986 --> 15:49.264
Niles, I think
she's having a stroke or something.

15:50.408 --> 15:53.002
No Dad, it's just g-speak.

15:53.286 --> 15:56.119
- Come again?
- She trots it out at parties.

15:56.414 --> 16:01.886
You just put a "g" in every syllable.
So, you would be M'gar'g'tin g'Crane.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.968
Just say it with me.
Come on: M'gar'g'tin...

16:07.592 --> 16:09.822
I don't think Dad's interested.

16:10.095 --> 16:13.405
- Oh, b'ge a good sp'gort, N'giles.
- What?

16:13.723 --> 16:17.352
- "Be a sport, Niles."
- B'ge a'g sp'gort, ta-dah!

16:17.686 --> 16:19.722
Dad, you still have your billy club?

16:19.979 --> 16:22.539
It's in my top drawer.

16:22.816 --> 16:27.765
It's all the rage in Washington.
You know who speaks it all the time?

16:28.154 --> 16:31.191
G'george Ste'g'pha'g'no'g'poul'g'os.

16:33.493 --> 16:39.204
I got pizza rolls but the expiration date
was yesterday. Are we game?

16:39.624 --> 16:43.139
That's not necessary, Daphne.
We don't want to spoil our appetites

16:43.461 --> 16:45.770
for that dinner in 20 minutes.

16:46.047 --> 16:48.800
That's right, that dinner in 20 minutes!

16:49.092 --> 16:51.731
I told you we shouldn't have
just stopped by.

16:52.012 --> 16:54.924
- These people have plans.
- How I envy them.

16:55.223 --> 16:58.056
It was such a pleasure meeting you.

16:58.351 --> 17:02.424
- Likewise.
- Oh, no. You can do better than that!

17:02.772 --> 17:05.205
(Giggles)

17:07.068 --> 17:10.060
Oh, I look forward to
my next trip to Seattle!

17:11.865 --> 17:14.459
If you're ever in Washington.
I'm in the b'gook.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.521
What the hell was that?

17:22.541 --> 17:25.852
- I feel sorry for the poor thing.
- I feel sorry for Niles.

17:26.171 --> 17:28.560
That's who I'm talking about.

17:30.759 --> 17:34.718
- You know I saw what you just did.
- What did I do?

17:35.055 --> 17:37.125
When she went to hug you,
you moved away.

17:37.390 --> 17:41.668
- Wouldn't you?
- You moved away from the window.

17:42.020 --> 17:45.376
You didn't want Irene to see you.
You care about her.

17:45.690 --> 17:47.646
Go chase yourself.

17:47.901 --> 17:51.860
You do. Something is stopping
you from having a relationship with her.

17:52.197 --> 17:54.757
You won't let go of this thing!

17:55.033 --> 17:58.742
- No, I won't.
- All right.

17:59.079 --> 18:01.912
- Irene's middle name is Rose.
- So?

18:02.207 --> 18:05.005
Rose is a nice name.
It was Mother's middle name.

18:09.172 --> 18:13.290
- Yeah.
- Oh, Dad.

18:14.469 --> 18:19.987
Look, you can't feel guilty about that.
Mom's been gone for six years now.

18:20.392 --> 18:24.704
Your feelings for Irene are separate
from those for Mom. If Mom was here,

18:25.063 --> 18:30.774
- she'd want you to get on with your life.
- OK. When I'm ready.

18:32.946 --> 18:37.258
Thanks Frasier. I guess I don't say it
often enough but you're a good kid.

18:37.617 --> 18:41.326
Thanks. There's something
I don't say often enough...

18:41.663 --> 18:43.858
There's nothing
you don't say often enough.

18:44.124 --> 18:46.433
Right, Dad.

18:50.880 --> 18:54.839
I couldn't help but overhear.
That was a very nice thing to say.

18:55.176 --> 18:57.132
Yeah, he's a good kid.

18:57.387 --> 19:02.620
Strangely, I could have sworn
Irene's middle name was Marie.

19:03.018 --> 19:07.057
- No.
- I can check. I still have all our notes.

19:07.397 --> 19:10.309
All right, I had to tell him something.

19:10.608 --> 19:15.921
He just won't believe me
when I tell him Irene isn't my type.

19:16.322 --> 19:20.031
- You sure?
- You gonna get on my back, too?

19:20.368 --> 19:22.677
No, but I was wondering

19:22.954 --> 19:27.789
if the reason why things didn't work out
between you and Irene was... well...

19:28.168 --> 19:30.921
- What?
- Well, maybe...

19:31.212 --> 19:33.851
if you weren't a bit self-conscious
about your hip?

19:35.216 --> 19:37.172
That's ridiculous.

19:37.427 --> 19:41.705
I'm glad to hear that. You don't have
anything to be self-conscious about.

19:42.057 --> 19:45.732
With that silvery mane,
twinkling blue eyes and whisky voice,

19:46.061 --> 19:48.416
you're quite a package.

19:48.688 --> 19:52.237
- Yeah, I'm quite a catch.
- You are.

19:52.567 --> 19:56.446
And you know as well as I do,
history is full of sexy limpers.

19:58.782 --> 20:00.852
For instance, Franklin D Roosevelt.

20:01.117 --> 20:04.029
Of course,
he didn't limp so much as roll.

20:04.329 --> 20:08.959
Toulouse-Lautrec.
Although he was a little person.

20:09.334 --> 20:13.725
Still, he did well with the ladies.
Of course, they were all prostitutes.

20:15.298 --> 20:18.370
But he was French -
there's no explaining their taste.

20:19.552 --> 20:24.751
- What's your point?
- I guess I don't have one. It's just me.

20:25.141 --> 20:28.019
But there is one little thing,

20:28.311 --> 20:33.146
every time you went to the telescope
to see Irene, you hid your cane.

20:36.569 --> 20:40.528
I just put it off to the side
so I wouldn't trip over the damn thing.

20:40.865 --> 20:43.425
I knew there was a good reason.

20:43.702 --> 20:47.411
It must feel awful silly
when that cane trips you up.

20:52.836 --> 20:57.307
- Hurry up! She'll be here any minute.
- All right.

20:57.674 --> 20:59.744
Have I got this tie on right?

21:00.010 --> 21:04.526
It needs a minor adjustment.
What's all this hair on it?

21:04.889 --> 21:09.883
The only way I can get the knot right,
is if I tie it on Eddie first.

21:13.398 --> 21:17.232
Has dating changed much
in the last 40 years?

21:17.569 --> 21:20.367
Well, the wardrobe
is a little different, but...

21:20.655 --> 21:23.328
your ultimate goal is still the same.

21:26.453 --> 21:31.083
- I'm glad you changed your mind.
- Me too. Thanks for our little talk.

21:31.458 --> 21:33.414
Yeah, my pleasure.

21:33.668 --> 21:35.863
Let's see, you got a hankie. Terrific.

21:36.129 --> 21:40.281
- Got your keys? Don't be out too late.
- Frasier!

21:40.633 --> 21:42.703
Just busting your chops.

21:42.969 --> 21:44.687
(Doorbell)

21:44.929 --> 21:46.681
Oh, my God!

21:46.931 --> 21:49.889
Will you two relax?
A word to the wise...

21:50.185 --> 21:55.259
If she asks you up to her place
after dinner, close the drapes.

22:03.365 --> 22:05.356
Hi, Irene.

22:06.785 --> 22:08.741
Nice to finally meet you.

22:13.750 --> 22:18.346
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:19.422 --> 22:20.696
# Mercy!

22:20.924 --> 22:25.679
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe, but I got you pegged

22:28.139 --> 22:33.577
# But I don't know what to do with those
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:33.978 --> 22:35.730
# They're calling again #

22:35.980 --> 22:37.299
Good night everybody!
