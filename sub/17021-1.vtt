00:21.978 --> 00:26.330
There's nothing like
descending on a shipwreck.

00:26.374 --> 00:30.291
It's like uncovering a mystery.

00:30.334 --> 00:34.730
Who was on board when she
was swallowed up by the sea?

00:34.773 --> 00:36.688
What were they
doing when it happened?

00:38.951 --> 00:42.651
And most importantly,
why did they go down?

00:59.885 --> 01:03.280
Most people never expect
bad things to happen to them...

01:06.153 --> 01:07.676
until they do.

01:08.981 --> 01:12.855
And then, it's usually too late.

01:16.815 --> 01:19.949
On the night of April 9th, 1942,

01:19.992 --> 01:23.344
a Norwegian merchant ship
known as the SS Benwood,

01:23.387 --> 01:27.087
was on a routine
voyage to Norfolk, Virginia

01:27.130 --> 01:29.741
when rumors of German
U-boats in the area

01:29.785 --> 01:32.657
forced the ship to
travel blacked out.

01:34.877 --> 01:37.836
At approximately 12:45 a.m.,

01:37.880 --> 01:40.752
a black object was sighted
off her starboard.

01:42.711 --> 01:44.669
She was on a direct collision
course with another freighter

01:44.713 --> 01:47.150
traveling under
the same conditions.

01:49.021 --> 01:51.937
The Captain made a last-minute
ditch effort to save it

01:51.981 --> 01:54.201
by ordering the
engine full astern.

01:56.159 --> 01:59.771
But the roaring of the motors
alerted the German submarine

01:59.815 --> 02:03.514
and now the SS Benwood lies
under 60 feet of water.

02:10.608 --> 02:12.044
They've been
down there too long.

02:12.088 --> 02:13.829
We should call somebody.

02:13.872 --> 02:15.918
They'll run out of
oxygen before help arrives.

02:20.705 --> 02:23.534
- Then we should go down.
- Don't worry. Cameron is a pro.

03:30.906 --> 03:32.777
Come on, here we go.
Help me!

03:39.219 --> 03:41.308
Move!
Everybody give me space.

03:42.787 --> 03:44.746
When I give the order
put this in her mouth.

03:44.789 --> 03:46.051
Ready?

03:47.227 --> 03:48.837
Come on, now.

03:51.579 --> 03:52.841
Move.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.497
Go.

03:57.976 --> 03:59.978
One, two, three...

04:05.549 --> 04:07.247
Sit up.

04:31.314 --> 04:34.535
Hey.
What are you doing here?

04:37.364 --> 04:40.149
I was thinking that maybe
we can go out for diner.

04:40.192 --> 04:44.109
I made a reservation at your
favorite Italian restaurant.

04:44.153 --> 04:48.723
That is so sweet,
but I'm exhausted.

04:48.766 --> 04:50.507
One of my students
almost drowned today.

04:50.551 --> 04:52.030
What?

04:52.074 --> 04:53.467
Seriously?
What happened?

04:53.510 --> 04:56.861
She got stuck under a beam
and I had to drag her out.

04:56.905 --> 04:59.429
Uh... You need to be careful.

04:59.473 --> 05:01.518
It would kind of
suck if you drowned.

05:01.562 --> 05:02.911
We've gone over this,

05:02.954 --> 05:05.305
more likely someone will
shoot me with a gun.

05:05.348 --> 05:08.220
Yeah, but you're a diver,
so drowning happens.

05:08.264 --> 05:10.092
Yeah, but I'm the
best diver so...

05:10.135 --> 05:11.093
Oh!

05:15.880 --> 05:17.317
- See you later.
- Bye, baby.

05:53.744 --> 05:56.399
Wow, this looks amazing.
What are we celebrating?

05:56.443 --> 05:58.575
Why we gotta be celebrating?

05:58.619 --> 06:02.144
'Cause you only cook for me when
we're celebrating something.

06:02.187 --> 06:03.754
That's not true.

06:03.798 --> 06:05.365
I cook all the time.

06:05.408 --> 06:07.932
No. Name the last
time you cooked.

06:07.976 --> 06:11.893
Let me think... Um...

06:11.936 --> 06:13.895
Wait a second.

06:13.938 --> 06:18.943
It's ok, it's ok. Don't think
too hard. I love you.

06:22.904 --> 06:24.471
Superbowl Sunday.

06:24.514 --> 06:26.124
What?

06:26.168 --> 06:28.388
You asked me the last time I
cooked. Superbowl Sunday.

06:28.431 --> 06:30.215
The BBQ?

06:30.259 --> 06:31.695
Burgers and hotdogs.

06:31.739 --> 06:34.437
Well, you just proved my point.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.613
You only cook for me when
it's a special occasion.

06:38.006 --> 06:39.355
You're right.

06:40.791 --> 06:45.883
And I should have done
this a long time ago.

06:46.493 --> 06:48.495
Oh! What's this?

07:00.550 --> 07:02.378
It's nice.

07:03.379 --> 07:05.163
Open it up.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.688
Oh.

07:14.521 --> 07:16.610
Oh, my god!

07:26.533 --> 07:28.535
You're my true north.

09:01.018 --> 09:02.498
Do you like it?

09:02.542 --> 09:04.152
What?

09:04.195 --> 09:05.762
The ring.

09:05.806 --> 09:07.808
Yes, I like it.

09:07.851 --> 09:11.246
I'm just worried about how
you can afford it.

09:11.289 --> 09:13.727
I have some money saved up.

09:13.770 --> 09:14.902
How much?

09:14.945 --> 09:16.120
Lots.

09:19.602 --> 09:22.910
Hey, you know I have
to go to work.

09:22.953 --> 09:25.390
Let's get married.

09:27.044 --> 09:29.612
Ok, I already said yes.
What are you talking about?

09:29.656 --> 09:32.789
Today. Let's go to the
courthouse and do it.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.443
Why today?

09:34.486 --> 09:38.665
It's about time that
we get married.

09:38.708 --> 09:42.712
Yeah, but what about
the dress and the party?

09:42.756 --> 09:45.236
We can do that later.

09:46.237 --> 09:49.327
Ok... No, not ok.
I can't.

09:49.371 --> 09:51.765
- How come?
- My sister. I need her here.

09:51.808 --> 09:54.332
Really?
Is that really necessary?

09:54.376 --> 09:56.421
Do you have a problem
with my sister?

09:56.465 --> 09:58.032
Yeah, she's going to tell you to get
married in her house in Kentucky.

09:58.075 --> 09:59.468
I love Kentucky.

09:59.511 --> 10:01.688
I'm not getting
married in Kentucky.

10:01.731 --> 10:03.994
Well, I'm not
getting married today.

10:05.300 --> 10:06.780
- Have a nice day at work.
- Um, hmm.

10:19.706 --> 10:21.708
I don't get it.

10:28.976 --> 10:30.978
Okay, do you have your ID, sir?

10:31.021 --> 10:32.414
Thank you.

10:32.457 --> 10:33.894
Alright, do you have
any weapons on you?

10:33.937 --> 10:36.070
- No.
- Alright, have a good day.

11:14.282 --> 11:16.414
These are the last of them.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.377
There's gotta be a mistake.

11:22.420 --> 11:25.162
We've gone over them a hundred
times. There's no mistake.

11:25.206 --> 11:27.730
Well, I know Shane.
He wouldn't do this.

11:27.774 --> 11:30.864
He did do it Kell,
it's right here.

11:30.907 --> 11:32.953
It's unbelievable.

11:35.129 --> 11:36.739
I'm gonna talk to him.

11:36.783 --> 11:40.830
Wait a minute, listen... I know
you still feel sorry for him,

11:40.874 --> 11:45.922
I understand... but
this is really serious.

11:45.966 --> 11:47.489
We need to go to the police.

11:47.532 --> 11:50.100
We're not gonna
go to the police.

11:50.144 --> 11:53.669
Here's what we're gonna do.
Save these on an external drive,

11:53.713 --> 11:55.671
hide them somewhere safe
and don't tell anyone.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.369
- What?
- Please.

11:58.413 --> 12:00.371
Are you kidding me, Kell?

12:03.157 --> 12:05.768
The truth just stinks.
You know what I mean?

12:05.812 --> 12:08.118
I mean, put it this way,
I never cheated on her.

12:09.816 --> 12:12.166
You know, these times
tables are all in whack.

12:12.209 --> 12:15.430
I need to get me a realistic ETA
on this contacted captain.

12:18.781 --> 12:20.696
Shane, you got a minute?

12:20.740 --> 12:23.003
- I'm kind of busy, can it wait?
- No.

12:24.308 --> 12:26.223
Man, I have a real
tight window here.

12:26.267 --> 12:28.051
I need a quick turnaround.
Can you do that for me?

12:28.095 --> 12:29.096
Yep. You got it, boss.

12:29.139 --> 12:30.575
Alright, thanks, buddy.

12:40.020 --> 12:41.238
What's up?

12:42.892 --> 12:45.155
Six containers missing
from last quarter's report.

12:45.199 --> 12:48.202
Yeah, that happens all the time.

12:48.245 --> 12:50.900
A lot of times companies over
report the amount of containers

12:50.944 --> 12:54.034
they're sending before
they're actually shipped.

12:54.077 --> 12:56.079
Obviously we forgot to go back
and adjust the numbers

12:56.123 --> 12:57.820
but I'll take care of it.
Don't worry about it.

12:57.864 --> 13:00.127
The thing is I do worry about it

13:00.170 --> 13:02.042
so I pulled up the old custom
forms from storage,

13:02.085 --> 13:04.261
you know
to try to sort things out,

13:04.305 --> 13:06.002
and I discovered that several
containers have gone missing

13:06.046 --> 13:07.917
every quarter since
you've been in charge.

13:07.961 --> 13:09.092
Like I said...

13:09.136 --> 13:10.920
On the days of the missing
containers

13:10.964 --> 13:13.357
so are the original
custom forms.

13:13.401 --> 13:16.621
All I could find were Xeroxed
copies with the numbers changed.

13:18.101 --> 13:20.451
Kelly, it's really not
such a big deal.

13:20.495 --> 13:22.410
Not such a big deal?

13:22.453 --> 13:24.804
We're talking millions of dollars
in goods that have disappeared.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.980
Who is this hurting? The
insurance companies cover it.

13:27.023 --> 13:29.025
Sure, but It's still illegal.

13:32.637 --> 13:34.552
Kelly, you know me.

13:34.596 --> 13:36.946
You know I'm not a thief.

13:36.990 --> 13:38.469
But this is more
complicated than you think.

13:38.513 --> 13:40.863
So please, just let it go.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.996
How can I possibly...
I can't, Shane.

13:43.039 --> 13:46.042
I want to help you, but I can't
do this while I'm in charge.

13:46.086 --> 13:52.222
Okay, okay.
I'll make it stop.

13:52.266 --> 13:53.571
Just give me a couple of
days to figure out how.

13:53.615 --> 13:55.965
Can you do that for me?

13:56.009 --> 13:57.575
You have 24 hours.

13:57.619 --> 14:00.404
If one more container goes
missing, I'm turning you in.

14:06.802 --> 14:09.544
Hey, it's Shane.

14:09.587 --> 14:11.415
There's a problem.

14:11.459 --> 14:13.243
Call me when you get this.

14:44.666 --> 14:48.191
I'm so glad.
Keep it.

14:48.235 --> 14:49.889
No, Shane has nothing
to do with it.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.455
I'll let him know.

14:52.674 --> 14:54.894
He's here right now.
I gotta go.

14:54.937 --> 14:57.984
I love you too, bye.

14:58.027 --> 14:59.768
Hey, it's my sister,

14:59.811 --> 15:01.726
she said she loves the
book you sent her.

15:01.770 --> 15:04.077
- That's sweet.
- What did you get? I'm starving.

15:07.558 --> 15:09.212
- What's up?
- It's probably just work stuff.

15:09.256 --> 15:10.561
I'll call them later.

15:10.605 --> 15:11.911
They forgot the soy sauce.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.129
There's some in the fridge.
I'll grab it.

15:13.173 --> 15:15.044
Thank you.

15:22.051 --> 15:23.400
Hello?

15:43.420 --> 15:45.205
Alright.
I'll be there in about an hour.

15:46.510 --> 15:48.382
- Yes...
- I gotta go.

15:48.425 --> 15:49.687
- I got an emergency.
- Now?

15:49.731 --> 15:52.038
Yes. It's work.

15:52.081 --> 15:53.387
Okay, well take some
food with you

15:53.430 --> 15:54.954
so you can have it in the car.

15:54.997 --> 15:57.739
No, I'm not even that hungry,
but thank you.

15:57.782 --> 16:00.785
I'm sorry baby, I gotta go.

16:37.387 --> 16:40.608
Look...

16:40.651 --> 16:42.958
I told you I sent
the check last week.

16:44.394 --> 16:47.136
I don't know, maybe it
got lost in the mail.

16:47.180 --> 16:49.008
Look, I'm in the middle
of something right now.

16:49.051 --> 16:50.748
I'll send it again
when I get home.

16:51.575 --> 16:53.751
Tell Bella I said hi.

16:55.884 --> 16:57.538
How's she doing?

16:57.581 --> 17:00.236
Internal bleeding, broken
bones, and major blood loss.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.237
Will she make it?

17:01.281 --> 17:03.065
Fifty-fifty.

17:03.109 --> 17:04.935
They'll run some tests and call
us if she regains consciousness.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.982
Do we have an ID?

17:07.026 --> 17:08.549
Her name is Kelly Jacobson.

17:08.592 --> 17:10.768
We found her purse in the car.

17:10.811 --> 17:14.207
Let's get forensic's to do an
evidence check of the vehicle

17:14.250 --> 17:16.470
and her body and send me
the details of the tire tracks.

17:16.512 --> 17:19.255
How about doing
some background work?

17:19.299 --> 17:20.647
What are you doing here?

17:20.691 --> 17:21.997
That's not the right question,

17:22.040 --> 17:23.912
the question is, what
was she doing here?

17:23.954 --> 17:25.087
This is a closed crime scene.

17:25.131 --> 17:26.435
If we find anything
we'll let you know.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.438
Thank you, officer Ortega,

17:28.482 --> 17:30.484
but the day I need your permission
to do my job is the day I'll retire.

17:30.527 --> 17:32.616
It's Detective Ortega,

17:32.660 --> 17:34.401
and this must be a real slow
news day for you

17:34.444 --> 17:36.794
to be pestering me at
this hour about a hit-and-run.

17:36.838 --> 17:39.101
Hit-and-run?
Is that what you call this?

17:39.145 --> 17:40.581
Where are you going?

17:40.624 --> 17:42.583
What's she doing?

17:42.626 --> 17:45.107
Tire tracks that head straight
towards the victim's footsteps,

17:45.151 --> 17:48.154
no sign of swerving
or even breaking,

17:48.197 --> 17:50.243
in the middle of nowhere?

17:50.286 --> 17:52.419
Someone tried to kill this
woman and if you can't see it,

17:52.462 --> 17:56.162
then you're either too
stupid or too drunk to notice.

17:56.205 --> 17:57.772
You must really have some
really big "cojones,"

17:57.815 --> 18:00.383
coming here and telling me
how to do my job.

18:00.427 --> 18:02.951
Get her out of here before
I do something I regret.

18:02.994 --> 18:05.519
It's okay.
I know how to walk.

18:08.435 --> 18:10.176
Pull the vic's phone records.

19:05.709 --> 19:08.016
- Hey...
- What are you doing down there?

19:08.059 --> 19:10.105
Nothing.

19:10.932 --> 19:13.326
What happened to you?

19:13.369 --> 19:16.503
It's just... nothing.

19:18.026 --> 19:19.288
What do you mean nothing?
Look at your face.

19:19.332 --> 19:22.073
I got jumped, late last night.

19:22.117 --> 19:24.337
They took my wallet and my car.

19:24.380 --> 19:26.556
Oh, my god! Are you, okay?
Did you call the cops?

19:26.600 --> 19:28.167
Yeah, it's fine.

19:28.210 --> 19:30.212
I'm just gonna need
to borrow your car.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.653
The day started out
like any other...

19:36.697 --> 19:39.395
Kelly Jacobson was getting
used to her new position

19:39.439 --> 19:42.746
as head accountant at the
international freight company.

19:42.790 --> 19:46.446
A promotion she had worked
for, for a very long time.

19:46.489 --> 19:49.231
That same night, Kelly
drove out to this place.

19:49.275 --> 19:51.320
No one knows why.

19:51.364 --> 19:53.670
She waited here,
outside her vehicle,

19:53.714 --> 19:55.281
to meet with someone.

19:55.324 --> 19:59.981
But instead, was run over by
a car that later fled the scene.

20:00.024 --> 20:03.593
Now, Kelly is here, at
Jackson Memorial Hospital,

20:03.637 --> 20:05.769
fighting for her life.

20:05.813 --> 20:10.339
Police are investigating this
man, Shane Allen King.

20:10.383 --> 20:12.254
A long-time manager
at the company

20:12.298 --> 20:15.823
who also happens to be
Kelly's ex-boyfriend.

20:19.696 --> 20:21.263
What do you want?
An applause?

20:21.307 --> 20:23.657
It's a cut and paste job,
a five-year-old can do it.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.833
Insert the reactions of the
freight company employees

20:25.876 --> 20:27.487
and add the part
where the PIO says

20:27.530 --> 20:29.358
they thought it was
a hit-and-run.

20:29.402 --> 20:30.794
I have to split.

20:30.838 --> 20:32.448
When you're done add my sign off

20:32.492 --> 20:33.841
and hold it until
I say it's ready.

20:43.764 --> 20:45.548
Yes, yes.
I need to report a crime.

20:46.767 --> 20:48.247
Yes, I'll hold.

20:49.596 --> 20:51.293
What are you doing?

20:54.557 --> 20:55.863
Hey, Maria,
that's company information.

20:55.906 --> 20:57.560
You can't take that.

20:59.214 --> 21:01.782
Hey, I'm talking to you.
What's the hell going on?

21:03.218 --> 21:05.351
Maria! Where the hell
are you going? Hey!

21:07.048 --> 21:08.789
Maria! You don't know who
you're messing with! Stop!

21:32.421 --> 21:34.249
Hey, where's everybody going?

21:38.297 --> 21:41.082
Alright, everybody, settle down.
Fall in, fall in.

21:43.737 --> 21:46.653
Yes, it's true.
I am retiring.

21:46.696 --> 21:48.742
I know what you are thinking,
"what's the difference? Right?

21:48.785 --> 21:50.918
Well, the difference is I'm...

21:50.961 --> 21:53.312
I'm gonna be spending more
time playing solitaire

21:53.355 --> 21:56.227
at my home computer
than here at the office.

21:56.271 --> 21:58.839
Hey, this has been one screwed
up career, I'll tell you that.

21:58.882 --> 22:01.450
I came up to this department
straight out of Nam.

22:01.494 --> 22:05.628
Back then, there wasn't much
difference between Saigon and Miami.

22:05.672 --> 22:07.804
Drugs, prostitution, murder.

22:07.848 --> 22:09.676
There was so much cocaine
floating around the city

22:09.719 --> 22:12.200
I am surprised anyone
has survived.

22:12.243 --> 22:14.376
I'm sure you heard all the
stories about how I took down

22:14.420 --> 22:16.813
the cartel and put an end
to prostitution,

22:16.857 --> 22:17.727
and cleaned up the streets.

22:22.123 --> 22:23.951
But the real truth is I couldn't
have done this by myself.

22:26.301 --> 22:29.217
I have a great family
and an amazing wife.

22:29.260 --> 22:31.350
Then I got you guys.
Anything else?

22:32.786 --> 22:35.136
Then we have the boys
who didn't make it.

22:39.009 --> 22:40.968
Bobby Black,

22:42.839 --> 22:46.147
Tony Collins, Ricky D...

22:48.671 --> 22:51.239
I carry their pictures every
day around in my wallet

22:51.282 --> 22:53.546
along with an inscription
that says,

22:53.589 --> 22:59.595
"A coward dies many deaths,
a dying man,

22:59.639 --> 23:02.772
only dies one."

23:07.821 --> 23:10.345
Alright, well that's enough,
go back to work.

23:10.389 --> 23:14.175
I'm not gone yet. Thank you.
Thanks for your attention.

23:17.396 --> 23:21.443
Hey O. Wow, man. Welcome back.
Are you alright?

23:21.487 --> 23:23.053
Oh, thanks, Chief.
I'm good.

23:23.097 --> 23:25.665
You look really down.
Is something bothering you?

23:25.708 --> 23:26.927
No. No, no, no.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.363
I'm glad to be back at work.

23:28.407 --> 23:29.451
Well, were glad to
have you back.

23:29.495 --> 23:31.235
Thank you.

23:31.279 --> 23:32.889
Any leads on the hit- and-run?

23:32.933 --> 23:36.415
Yeah, we might be bringing in a
suspect soon, maybe tonight.

23:36.458 --> 23:38.199
Good. Get on it.

23:38.242 --> 23:39.548
- Welcome back, man.
- Thank you.

23:39.592 --> 23:40.897
- Stay healthy.
- Alright.

23:40.941 --> 23:42.290
Take an aspirin.

23:45.075 --> 23:47.513
Any news on the Vic?

23:47.556 --> 23:51.168
She's in an induced
coma at Jackson Memorial.

23:51.212 --> 23:53.432
We still don't know if
she'll be able to talk.

24:25.376 --> 24:29.293
Hey, it's me... again.

24:29.337 --> 24:32.209
I hope your okay, because I've
called you like ten times today.

24:32.253 --> 24:33.994
You're not answering.

24:34.037 --> 24:39.652
Um, anyway, I think you forgot
to pick me up from work today.

24:39.695 --> 24:41.044
But it's okay,

24:41.088 --> 24:42.655
I'll find somebody else
to take me.

24:42.698 --> 24:47.398
Listen, just call me
when you get this.

24:47.442 --> 24:49.052
I'm really worried.

24:50.097 --> 24:51.490
Okay, bye.

26:02.473 --> 26:04.214
Babe, are you home?

26:04.258 --> 26:07.827
Yeah! I'm downstairs. Uh...

26:07.870 --> 26:10.438
I'm down here,
I'll be up in a second.

26:10.481 --> 26:13.441
I'm so sorry,
I forgot to pick you up.

26:13.484 --> 26:16.836
My phone died and
I wasn't thinking.

26:16.879 --> 26:18.272
I'm sorry.

26:18.315 --> 26:19.795
No, it's fine.

26:19.839 --> 26:23.538
Just grab some food from
the fridge and make dinner.

26:23.582 --> 26:24.800
Ok. Thanks!

26:35.855 --> 26:37.421
Do you want a tea or something?

26:37.465 --> 26:38.945
No. I'm fine.

26:47.214 --> 26:49.042
What are you doing here?

26:49.085 --> 26:52.219
Just looking for some wine.
Found it.

26:54.961 --> 26:57.050
Are you ok?
You look flustered.

26:57.093 --> 26:59.443
Yeah, I just have a
headache today.

27:01.837 --> 27:04.013
I put the compass in your bag.

27:04.057 --> 27:05.754
It might come in handy someday.

27:05.798 --> 27:07.974
Ok. Thanks.

27:52.975 --> 27:57.197
- Hello?
- Hey, It's me.

27:57.240 --> 28:01.331
I just wanted to let you
know I sent that check again.

28:01.375 --> 28:03.551
Good.

28:05.335 --> 28:07.033
Is everything okay?

28:07.076 --> 28:08.556
I'm kind of busy right now.

28:08.599 --> 28:09.949
Is there something you need?

28:09.992 --> 28:12.647
Um... Can I speak to Bella?

28:12.691 --> 28:15.389
I'd rather not.
I just put her to bed.

28:15.432 --> 28:20.002
Look... I'm her father.
I have the right to talk to her.

28:20.046 --> 28:23.179
No. She'll get excited and
then I can't get her to sleep.

28:23.223 --> 28:26.313
No, no, no. I promise,
I won't excite her.

28:26.356 --> 28:29.925
I just need to hear her voice.

28:29.969 --> 28:32.580
Fine.
Give me a second.

28:34.843 --> 28:36.497
Hi, Daddy?

28:37.890 --> 28:40.327
Princesa.

28:40.370 --> 28:42.198
How are you doing, baby?

28:42.242 --> 28:45.593
I miss you, papi.
When are you coming home?

28:46.812 --> 28:49.336
Um... I don't know.

28:49.379 --> 28:51.425
I miss you, too.

28:51.468 --> 28:54.080
Will you sing me my song.

28:55.516 --> 28:58.737
Yeah.

28:58.780 --> 29:03.916
Esta nena linda
se quiere dormir,

29:03.959 --> 29:09.530
cierra los ojitos y
los vuelve a abrir.

29:09.573 --> 29:14.013
Duérmete mi niña,
duérmete mi amor.

29:18.452 --> 29:23.587
Duérmete pedazo de mi corazón.

29:26.808 --> 29:28.549
Good-night sweetheart.

29:28.592 --> 29:30.420
Good-night, Daddy.

29:46.697 --> 29:47.742
Are you ready?

29:49.004 --> 29:50.614
Almost.

29:53.095 --> 29:54.488
You gonna remember
to pick me up today

29:54.531 --> 29:57.317
or should I ask someone else?

29:57.360 --> 30:00.624
I told you, I'm sorry.
What else do you want me to do?

30:02.365 --> 30:05.847
I just want you to know
that I'm here for you

30:05.891 --> 30:08.154
if you need to talk.

30:08.197 --> 30:10.504
You can tell me things.

30:10.547 --> 30:11.940
Thank you.

30:11.984 --> 30:13.376
I appreciate that.

30:30.350 --> 30:31.917
It's so hard for me
to understand

30:31.960 --> 30:34.397
your relationship with him.

30:34.441 --> 30:37.618
If my parents were still alive,
I'd call them every day.

30:37.661 --> 30:39.141
I know, It's...

30:39.185 --> 30:41.143
It's hard for me.

30:43.145 --> 30:45.408
I just feel like I've always been
a big disappointment to them.

30:45.452 --> 30:46.801
Why? Why would you say that?

30:46.845 --> 30:49.282
Because he feels that honesty

30:49.325 --> 30:51.327
is the greatest virtue
a person can have.

30:51.371 --> 30:52.633
And I disagree.

30:52.676 --> 30:54.461
You think it's ok to be a liar?

30:54.504 --> 30:58.857
No, I just feel that there's
other virtues a person can have

30:58.900 --> 31:00.380
and honesty is just one of them.

31:04.558 --> 31:06.777
It doesn't mean you
get to stop calling him.

31:06.821 --> 31:08.736
He doesn't like to talk on the
phone and every time I see him

31:08.779 --> 31:10.825
it's like he wants
to get rid of me.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.697
I think what we're
dealing with is his personality.

31:13.741 --> 31:15.177
I don't think it's about you.

31:20.008 --> 31:21.705
What's the matter?

31:23.533 --> 31:25.318
I feel like that car has been
following us since we left home.

31:26.928 --> 31:28.887
- The silver one?
- Yeah.

31:31.150 --> 31:33.326
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna lose him.

31:46.643 --> 31:48.558
Pull over to the side.

32:08.187 --> 32:09.710
Could you turn the
engine off for me?

32:13.844 --> 32:14.976
Why'd you pull me over?

32:15.020 --> 32:16.673
You ran a red light over there.

32:18.893 --> 32:20.851
License and registra, please.

32:27.641 --> 32:28.947
I'll be right back.

32:51.926 --> 32:53.362
Sir, is this your vehicle?

32:53.406 --> 32:55.016
No, it's mine. Why?

32:55.060 --> 32:56.278
You mind coming down
to the station with me?

32:56.322 --> 32:57.627
What for?

32:57.671 --> 32:59.934
I just need to ask
you some questions?

32:59.978 --> 33:01.544
Can't you just ask me here? I was just
about to drop my girlfriend off at work.

33:01.588 --> 33:03.546
No, it's okay.
I'll go with you.

33:03.590 --> 33:04.808
Are you sure?

33:04.852 --> 33:06.158
Yeah. I'll get someone
to cover for me.

33:07.246 --> 33:08.725
Follow me.

33:23.871 --> 33:26.961
So, you left in the
middle of the night

33:27.005 --> 33:29.355
to go meet this reporter

33:29.398 --> 33:31.400
and then, out of nowhere
a random group of thugs

33:31.444 --> 33:33.359
jump out of and assault you?

33:36.101 --> 33:37.276
Yep.

33:38.364 --> 33:40.757
And you didn't report this?

33:40.801 --> 33:43.891
Why? Why didn't you
report the assault?

33:47.025 --> 33:48.200
What a joke.

33:48.243 --> 33:49.723
What did you say?

33:49.766 --> 33:51.681
This is all a goddamn circus!

33:51.725 --> 33:53.422
I was told to
keep my mouth shut,

33:53.466 --> 33:55.033
What do you want from me?

33:55.076 --> 33:56.643
Who told you to
keep your mouth shut?

34:01.822 --> 34:04.607
What I don't understand is,
what was so important that

34:04.651 --> 34:07.088
you had to go meet this reporter
in the middle of the night?

34:07.132 --> 34:08.610
I don't know.
Ask her.

34:08.655 --> 34:10.570
Don't worry, I will.

34:10.612 --> 34:14.007
I just find your story a
little too convenient.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.924
Well actually, it'd be more
convenient to have an alibi.

34:16.967 --> 34:18.839
That way I wouldn't have
to convince you.

34:21.536 --> 34:22.581
You think this is a joke?

34:24.627 --> 34:26.150
Huh?

34:28.849 --> 34:30.329
This is funny?

34:32.592 --> 34:34.072
What is this?

34:34.114 --> 34:35.246
What happened to her?

34:36.335 --> 34:37.597
I don't know.
You tell me.

34:37.639 --> 34:40.121
I don't know?
I haven't seen her in days.

34:40.165 --> 34:42.993
She was last seen
having an argument with you.

34:43.036 --> 34:45.648
The last person she called
was you.

34:45.692 --> 34:47.737
You left in the
middle of the night,

34:47.781 --> 34:50.565
exactly at the time
she was hit by a car,

34:50.610 --> 34:52.481
a car just like yours.

34:55.918 --> 34:57.834
Did you have a relationship with
Kelly outside of the office?

34:57.878 --> 35:00.098
I don't see how that has
anything to do with this.

35:00.141 --> 35:02.970
Seventy percent of all the
murders I investigate are

35:03.013 --> 35:06.582
committed by partners or
ex-partners of the victims.

35:09.846 --> 35:11.239
I told you everything I know.

35:11.283 --> 35:12.893
I don't know what
else you want from me.

35:12.936 --> 35:14.286
I'll tell you what I want.

35:16.592 --> 35:20.118
I want you to make
this easy for yourself.

35:20.161 --> 35:22.120
You're lucky Kelly
is still alive.

35:22.163 --> 35:24.165
If you confess...
maybe we can make a deal.

35:24.209 --> 35:28.038
But if she dies, you're screwed.

35:45.012 --> 35:47.014
Thanks for coming on
such short notice.

35:48.798 --> 35:49.930
This place really annoys me
and I've really had enough.

35:54.108 --> 35:55.675
She had lunch with him.

36:02.247 --> 36:04.162
Call me if you and your boyfriend
think of anything else.

36:07.469 --> 36:09.167
And don't leave town.

36:29.926 --> 36:32.973
I left to meet that reporter,
Monica Gordon.

36:33.016 --> 36:35.236
You know who she is.
The tall one, with short hair.

36:35.280 --> 36:38.413
Yes, I know who she is. I just
saw her walk into the building.

36:38.457 --> 36:40.720
What I want to know is why
are you lying to me.

36:40.763 --> 36:43.679
I wasn't lying, she was
working on a report

36:43.723 --> 36:45.899
about something that
was going on at work.

36:45.942 --> 36:47.857
I just can't talk about it.

36:49.511 --> 36:51.426
Listen, if anything happens
to me you should find her.

36:51.470 --> 36:53.080
She can vouch for me.

36:53.123 --> 36:55.082
What's going to happen to you?
Why would you say that?

36:56.649 --> 36:59.652
I have to go. Let's talk
about it later tonight.

36:59.695 --> 37:01.523
When I pick you up from work.

37:05.310 --> 37:07.964
Everything is gonna be fine.

37:16.364 --> 37:18.236
I don't care what happens to me.
I'm going to the press.

37:18.279 --> 37:19.672
I'm serious.

37:23.415 --> 37:24.503
Hey, boss.

37:24.546 --> 37:26.418
Okay, I gotta go.

37:27.810 --> 37:29.986
- What's up?
- Have you heard from Maria?

37:30.030 --> 37:31.901
No. Why?

37:31.945 --> 37:35.557
Everyone out there is going crazy.
They're all asking for her.

37:35.601 --> 37:36.863
She didn't come to work today

37:36.906 --> 37:38.560
and she isn't
answering her phone.

37:38.604 --> 37:41.781
I don't know, Manny. Hey,
listen, I have a lot going on.

37:41.824 --> 37:43.304
Sure.

38:21.908 --> 38:24.171
Hey, Cameron, are you ready.

38:24.214 --> 38:25.303
Yeah.

38:26.652 --> 38:28.958
- Is everything's ok?
- Everything's good.

38:29.002 --> 38:30.917
- The students are here.
- Alright, let's go.

40:11.365 --> 40:12.975
What do you think?
Another hit-and-run?

40:13.019 --> 40:14.324
You again.

40:14.368 --> 40:16.326
Still no suspects?

40:16.370 --> 40:19.068
I'm sorry, I didn't know
I had to report to you.

40:19.112 --> 40:21.331
Did you find the car?

40:21.375 --> 40:23.508
Why are you here?

40:23.551 --> 40:25.858
It's my job.

40:29.775 --> 40:31.907
Look, if there's something
you know that I don't,

40:31.951 --> 40:34.040
please share.

40:34.083 --> 40:35.737
Actually, there is.

40:37.347 --> 40:38.610
So, if anything happens to me,

40:38.653 --> 40:40.612
I need you to tell
everyone what you know.

40:42.657 --> 40:45.617
What're you talking about,

40:45.660 --> 40:49.534
I don't know nothing and I
ain't talking to no one.

40:49.577 --> 40:50.709
What do you mean
you know nothing?

40:50.752 --> 40:52.319
You were there.

40:52.362 --> 40:54.408
You helped me.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.584
Yes, because you asked me to.

40:58.107 --> 41:02.111
Manny, you don't understand.
You're all I got.

41:10.772 --> 41:16.082
Whatever you were doing,
that's your thing.

41:16.125 --> 41:18.650
It's not mine, ok?

41:20.608 --> 41:21.740
Sorry.

41:24.699 --> 41:26.005
We've got a warrant
for Mr. Shane King.

41:27.441 --> 41:29.574
Look, I'm sorry.

41:29.617 --> 41:31.532
But I have a family.

41:31.576 --> 41:33.665
I gotta take care of them.

41:35.536 --> 41:36.668
Shane King.

41:36.711 --> 41:38.234
Hands on the desk
where I can see them.

41:38.278 --> 41:40.280
We got a warrant
for your arrest.

41:40.323 --> 41:43.196
I can't believe this.
I thought you were my friend.

41:44.414 --> 41:46.460
Just stop.

41:46.504 --> 41:48.157
Take everything, the
computer, all the files,

41:48.201 --> 41:49.594
and the trash.

41:50.769 --> 41:52.292
Let's go.

42:15.315 --> 42:17.883
Hey Cam, check this out.

42:17.926 --> 42:20.799
The suspect in both
cases is this man,

42:20.842 --> 42:22.757
Shane Allen King.

42:22.801 --> 42:24.759
A long time manager
at the company

42:24.803 --> 42:28.458
who also happens to be
Kelly's ex-boyfriend.

42:30.199 --> 42:32.245
Shane confronted Maria who
worked at the container company

42:32.288 --> 42:34.682
Maria's body was found in the
river earlier this morning.

42:34.726 --> 42:38.251
Investigators were already
looking into Shane and his role

42:38.294 --> 42:40.645
before Maria's disappearance.

42:40.688 --> 42:44.300
Shane has now been arrested
under suspicion of homicide.

42:44.344 --> 42:46.999
I know. Go. I'll take care
of everything here.

42:53.135 --> 42:55.616
You gotta believe me.
I had nothing to do with this.

42:55.660 --> 42:57.400
What about Maria?

42:57.444 --> 42:59.925
She worked for you too, right?

42:59.968 --> 43:02.797
Cam, I wish I could explain it
to you but I need some time

43:02.841 --> 43:04.103
to see how all of
this plays out.

43:04.146 --> 43:06.496
No, no Shane.
You don't have any more time.

43:06.540 --> 43:09.108
You're going to
prison for murder.

43:09.151 --> 43:11.893
If there's anything you can
use, you have to use it now.

43:11.937 --> 43:14.200
I can't.

43:14.243 --> 43:15.984
What do you mean you can't?

43:16.028 --> 43:18.421
I can't talk about it right now.

43:19.684 --> 43:21.903
Remember that
reporter Monica Gordon?

43:21.947 --> 43:23.644
Go see her.
Maybe she can explain.

43:23.688 --> 43:28.867
- I don't understand why you-
- Cam, please, trust me.

43:41.706 --> 43:43.621
I have two minutes.
What do you want?

43:43.664 --> 43:46.188
Shane told me I should
come talk to you.

43:46.232 --> 43:48.930
He thinks you might have some
information that can help us.

43:48.974 --> 43:50.279
Help you how?

43:50.323 --> 43:52.151
I'm not sure.

43:52.194 --> 43:54.980
I've never been through
anything like this before.

43:55.023 --> 43:58.157
I just know Shane is innocent

43:58.200 --> 44:01.464
and I'm hoping that you
can help me prove it.

44:01.508 --> 44:04.337
He told me that you were
supposed to meet with him

44:04.380 --> 44:07.296
the night Kelly was
hit by the car.

44:07.340 --> 44:09.168
Did he tell you why we
were suppose to meet?

44:09.211 --> 44:11.126
No.

44:11.170 --> 44:13.346
Look, Cameron?

44:13.389 --> 44:14.956
I'm really sorry about
what your going through

44:15.000 --> 44:17.089
but there's nothing I can do.

44:17.132 --> 44:18.786
Now, if you'll excuse me,

44:18.830 --> 44:21.136
I have a piece I have to finish
in ten minutes.

44:21.180 --> 44:22.790
Good luck.

44:30.972 --> 44:35.194
The arraignment for Shane Allen
King is scheduled for tomorrow.

44:35.237 --> 44:38.676
We'll bring you more coverage
of the case as the news breaks.

44:58.391 --> 44:59.479
Monica!

44:59.522 --> 45:02.003
- Oh!
- I'm sorry to sneak up on you.

45:02.047 --> 45:04.745
But I don't know
what else to do.

45:04.789 --> 45:06.355
Listen, I understand.

45:06.399 --> 45:08.618
But this doesn't look goodfor Shane.

45:08.662 --> 45:11.143
I'm not saying he's
guilty but he has no alibi,

45:11.186 --> 45:13.667
or witnesses and
without that he has nothing.

45:13.711 --> 45:15.887
He has me.

45:15.930 --> 45:17.497
He was with me the
night of the murder.

45:17.540 --> 45:18.890
What?

45:18.933 --> 45:21.153
The night Maria was killed,
Shane was with me.

45:21.196 --> 45:23.764
Do you have a lawyer?

45:23.808 --> 45:25.853
I spoke with one.

45:25.897 --> 45:29.074
He wanted me to make a deal with
the State Attorney's Office.

45:29.117 --> 45:31.163
So who's defending
Shane tomorrow?

45:31.206 --> 45:32.817
A public defender.

45:32.860 --> 45:34.906
- Oh!
- What? Is that bad?

45:34.949 --> 45:38.300
Not necessarily.
They're just overworked.

45:38.344 --> 45:41.826
Please, help me.

45:45.133 --> 45:46.744
I'm a reporter.

45:46.787 --> 45:48.441
My job is to cover the story.

45:48.484 --> 45:49.747
Not to get involved.

45:49.790 --> 45:51.139
But you already are involved.

45:51.183 --> 45:53.968
Please you know more
about this than anyone else.

45:55.143 --> 45:56.362
You won't give up, will you?

45:56.405 --> 45:57.798
Never.

45:59.234 --> 46:01.106
Okay.

46:01.149 --> 46:02.542
I'll tell you what I can do.

46:02.585 --> 46:04.022
I'll call my lawyer.

46:04.065 --> 46:08.504
If anyone can help Shane,
it's him.

46:08.548 --> 46:10.245
In exchange I want
something from you.

46:10.289 --> 46:11.986
Anything.

46:12.030 --> 46:13.945
As soon as he gets out I want a
one-on-one exclusive interview

46:13.988 --> 46:15.424
with you and Shane.

46:19.037 --> 46:20.386
Do we have a deal?

46:32.050 --> 46:33.965
Considering that the
defendant does not appear

46:34.008 --> 46:36.532
to be a flight risk,

46:36.576 --> 46:41.233
and that all the evidence presented
by the prosecution is circumstantial,

46:41.276 --> 46:43.061
I am inclined
to set the defendant free.

46:45.411 --> 46:46.804
And I have to say,

46:46.847 --> 46:49.632
I think the prosecution
is really reaching here.

46:49.676 --> 46:53.114
You haven't presented a
single piece of direct

46:53.158 --> 46:56.074
or physical evidence that proves
that there was even a murder here.

46:56.117 --> 46:59.642
Or a plausible theory as to
what the defendants motivation

46:59.686 --> 47:04.386
might be for committing
these alleged crimes.

47:04.430 --> 47:07.737
I suggest you go back
to the drawing board

47:07.781 --> 47:10.653
and bring me something
with some more merit.

47:10.697 --> 47:12.655
Really.

47:12.699 --> 47:14.483
The court orders the defendant

47:14.527 --> 47:17.443
be released on personal
recognizances.

47:17.486 --> 47:19.488
Next.

47:26.626 --> 47:29.629
Hey, big guy.
Tough break.

47:29.672 --> 47:31.892
I heard the perp got away.

47:31.936 --> 47:34.416
Tyrants in black robes.

47:34.460 --> 47:37.245
Sometimes I feel like they make
up the law as they go along.

47:37.289 --> 47:39.552
You knew that judge.

47:39.595 --> 47:41.989
You had to expect
he'd rule that way.

47:44.165 --> 47:47.647
In the future you gotta make sure
that you have your case iron clad.

47:47.690 --> 47:49.388
Seems like the only way he was
going to keep him locked up

47:49.431 --> 47:51.999
was if Shane murdered
somebody with his own eyes.

47:52.043 --> 47:54.088
And even then he'd
still have doubts.

47:54.132 --> 47:56.351
Maybe.

47:56.395 --> 47:58.788
What're you working on.

47:58.832 --> 48:00.921
I may be on to something.

48:02.531 --> 48:04.925
I think we've been going about
this the wrong way.

48:04.969 --> 48:08.755
We've been focusing on the fact
that Shane and Kelly were together.

48:08.798 --> 48:10.452
We failed to see that the
two girls that were attacked

48:10.496 --> 48:13.020
worked in the accounting
department.

48:13.064 --> 48:15.414
Now, when we picked up Shane,

48:15.457 --> 48:19.200
we found all these shredded
reports in a wastebasket.

48:19.244 --> 48:22.377
I think Shane got caught with
his hands in the cookie jar.

48:22.421 --> 48:24.205
Then he tried
to get rid of them.

48:24.249 --> 48:26.077
Wow, you have a wild
imagination.

48:26.120 --> 48:27.687
I think you're grasping
at straws.

48:27.730 --> 48:30.603
Why don't you take a day off.
Come back at it tomorrow.

48:39.742 --> 48:42.267
- Oh!
- Shane.

48:42.310 --> 48:44.530
This has been a nightmare.
Thank you.

48:46.575 --> 48:49.665
Don't thank me yet.
We still have a trial coming up.

48:49.709 --> 48:53.452
It's ok. With you by my side,
I'll be fine.

48:53.495 --> 48:55.106
There's something else.

48:55.149 --> 48:57.935
I spoke to that reporter you
told me about. Monica Gordon.

48:57.978 --> 48:59.588
And?

48:59.632 --> 49:01.634
And... she's the one who
got you the lawyer.

49:01.677 --> 49:03.897
But she wants
something in return,

49:03.941 --> 49:06.247
she wants to interview us.

49:06.291 --> 49:07.727
No. We can't

49:07.770 --> 49:09.555
Well, you kind of have to.
I promised her.

49:09.598 --> 49:10.948
You don't understand.
I can't.

49:10.991 --> 49:15.996
Okay. Well, then can you
explain it to me?

49:16.040 --> 49:18.825
I keep trying to help you,
but you keep throwing obstacles

49:18.868 --> 49:20.827
in my way.

49:20.870 --> 49:23.873
If it wasn't for her,
you'd still be in there.

49:23.917 --> 49:25.571
When?

49:25.614 --> 49:27.138
Tonight.

49:28.878 --> 49:30.489
What are you doing?

49:30.532 --> 49:32.230
I just have some last minute
footage I need to use.

49:32.273 --> 49:33.883
- What is it?
- An interview.

49:33.927 --> 49:35.015
Of whom?

49:35.059 --> 49:36.886
It's a surprise.

49:36.930 --> 49:39.019
Nothing goes on my show
without my approval.

49:39.063 --> 49:41.326
Huh... your show?
I'm your show.

49:41.369 --> 49:43.371
Don't you dare import that
video. I'm warning you.

49:43.415 --> 49:45.547
Fine. Have it your way.

49:50.988 --> 49:52.380
- Ready!
- Thank you.

49:54.078 --> 49:57.603
Here we go. I done.

49:57.646 --> 49:59.126
Don't think of it that way.

49:59.170 --> 50:02.390
Think of it as an opportunity
to prove your innocence.

50:02.434 --> 50:04.218
This way.

50:06.264 --> 50:07.830
Okay, we're on in ten,
everybody.

50:09.397 --> 50:11.182
Please...

50:14.489 --> 50:16.839
In five, four...

50:20.582 --> 50:22.149
Good evening.

50:22.193 --> 50:24.934
We interrupt tonight's regular
programming to bring you

50:24.978 --> 50:28.025
an exclusive interview with a
man who has recently been

50:28.068 --> 50:32.246
in the spotlight of every local
news outlet in South Florida.

50:32.290 --> 50:36.120
I'm talking about
Shane Allen King.

50:36.163 --> 50:39.775
This thirty-seven-year-old Cargo
Terminal Operations Manager

50:39.819 --> 50:43.040
has been accused of running
over one of his co-workers

50:43.083 --> 50:45.129
and murdering another.

50:45.172 --> 50:47.218
Shane, Cameron,

50:47.261 --> 50:51.091
thanks for accepting to do this
interview with me tonight.

50:51.135 --> 50:53.572
I hear you are both
recently engaged.

50:53.615 --> 50:55.008
Congratulations.

50:55.052 --> 50:56.662
Thank you.

50:56.705 --> 51:00.100
I imagine all of this must
be very hard on both of you.

51:00.144 --> 51:02.363
How are you dealing with it?

51:02.407 --> 51:05.323
Cameron's been by my side
these last few days.

51:05.366 --> 51:07.455
Without her support
I'd be totally lost.

51:09.240 --> 51:11.111
How about you, Cameron?

51:11.155 --> 51:13.896
Have you ever had any doubts
that you might be marrying

51:13.940 --> 51:15.202
the wrong man?

51:15.246 --> 51:17.204
Absolutely not.

51:17.248 --> 51:18.814
I've known Shane for years

51:18.858 --> 51:21.382
and he's the best man
I've ever met.

51:21.426 --> 51:23.123
I'm glad to hear that.

51:23.167 --> 51:27.388
Shane, let's start
with the first victim, Kelly.

51:27.432 --> 51:29.042
How did you two know each other?

51:29.086 --> 51:31.305
We worked together
at the cargo company.

51:31.349 --> 51:33.916
I'm a manager there and
she's the head accountant.

51:33.960 --> 51:36.571
Did you two have a personal
relationship as well?

51:37.790 --> 51:40.314
Yes.
We dated a few years ago.

51:40.358 --> 51:43.056
I heard you were actually
engaged to get married,

51:43.100 --> 51:44.405
is that true?

51:44.449 --> 51:47.843
Yes, but like I said, it
was a long time ago.

51:47.887 --> 51:51.151
Why did you two break up?

51:51.195 --> 51:53.371
Personal reasons.

51:53.414 --> 51:55.764
According to a person
I interviewed,

51:55.808 --> 51:57.766
a few days before the wedding
you discovered that Kelly

51:57.810 --> 51:59.333
was cheating on you.

52:02.075 --> 52:04.033
I'd rather not talk about that.

52:04.077 --> 52:06.123
You found her in bed
with another co-worker.

52:06.166 --> 52:07.472
Isn't that right?

52:07.515 --> 52:08.951
You found her in bed with Maria.

52:08.995 --> 52:11.780
The girl who was murdered.

52:11.824 --> 52:13.826
Yes.

52:13.869 --> 52:17.134
Kelly and Maria were a couple.

52:17.177 --> 52:21.181
Where were you the night
Maria was murdered?

52:21.225 --> 52:22.530
I was advised not to give specific
information about the case.

52:22.574 --> 52:26.578
I see.

52:26.621 --> 52:28.493
You know, after Kelly was hit
by the car,

52:28.536 --> 52:32.366
I called Maria for her comments
but she didn't call me back.

52:32.410 --> 52:34.890
So I did what any
thorough reporter would do,

52:34.934 --> 52:37.197
I went to her apartment.

52:37.241 --> 52:41.810
Now, I have to apologize for
the image and sound quality

52:41.854 --> 52:45.336
on this video since it was
recorded on my phone.

52:45.379 --> 52:47.033
Whoa... What is she doing?

52:47.076 --> 52:52.647
This was taken just hours
before Maria was murdered.

52:52.691 --> 52:54.127
How do you know Kelly?

52:54.171 --> 52:55.911
She's my wife.

52:55.955 --> 52:59.219
We got married in New York
this past weekend.

52:59.263 --> 53:01.830
I told her not to do this.
She's overriding my authority.

53:01.874 --> 53:03.919
...before she was
run over by the car.

53:03.963 --> 53:06.792
Do you have any idea
who might have done this to her?

53:06.835 --> 53:09.360
Yes. I think I know.

53:09.403 --> 53:11.884
Who do you think did this?

53:13.102 --> 53:14.713
It was Shane.

53:15.540 --> 53:17.411
Yeah, it was Shane.

53:18.804 --> 53:21.067
This interview is over.
You set me up!

53:21.110 --> 53:22.460
Please, sit down.
We can talk about this.

53:22.503 --> 53:23.722
Go to hell!

53:26.768 --> 53:28.161
I'm sorry for the outburst.

53:28.205 --> 53:29.684
We'll be right back.

53:34.298 --> 53:35.212
What the hell did you just do? Didn't
I tell you not to use that video?

53:35.255 --> 53:36.125
Do you have a release for that?

53:36.169 --> 53:37.170
What do you care?
She's dead.

53:37.214 --> 53:38.389
I'm going to have
your ass for this.

53:38.432 --> 53:39.825
- You'll going to have my ass?
- You bet!

53:39.868 --> 53:42.828
You should be worshiping
the ground I walk on!

53:42.871 --> 53:45.439
You call yourself
a news producer?

53:45.483 --> 53:47.441
You disgust me.

53:50.357 --> 53:52.229
I warned you. I told you
this was a bad idea.

53:52.272 --> 53:55.319
Shane! Why didn't you tell me
about Kelly and Maria?

53:55.362 --> 53:56.929
Because it was a long time ago.
I didn't think it mattered.

53:56.972 --> 53:58.670
What about what she said?

53:58.713 --> 54:00.019
What about what Maria said?

54:00.062 --> 54:01.673
What about it?
That doesn't mean anything.

54:01.716 --> 54:03.675
She thinks that you did it.

54:06.808 --> 54:08.462
I thought you trusted me.

54:08.506 --> 54:09.594
I thought you were on my side.

54:09.637 --> 54:11.639
I thought I did, too.

54:12.901 --> 54:14.425
I see.

54:14.468 --> 54:16.035
Shane.

54:16.078 --> 54:17.776
Where are you going?

54:19.778 --> 54:21.258
Did he leave?

54:21.301 --> 54:24.043
Yeah, Monica, he left!
What did you expect?

54:24.086 --> 54:25.479
I'm sorry, I was
just doing my job.

54:25.523 --> 54:27.525
You didn't tell me
you had that video.

54:27.568 --> 54:29.222
Are you sure Shane is
who you think he is?

54:31.659 --> 54:33.966
I don't know what
to think anymore.

54:36.316 --> 54:37.970
Can I give you one
piece of advise?

54:38.013 --> 54:40.059
Just woman to woman.

54:40.799 --> 54:42.496
Don't get involved.

54:42.540 --> 54:45.064
It won't end well for you.
It never does.

55:14.659 --> 55:17.792
Oh! Sorry, I didn't know
you were here.

55:17.836 --> 55:20.317
Did you see the interview
on Channel five?

55:20.708 --> 55:22.493
Yeah.

55:23.929 --> 55:25.322
I couldn't watch it.
I had to turn it off.

55:26.758 --> 55:29.064
Look what that monster
did to my little girl.

55:30.457 --> 55:33.460
Have you been able to
talk to the doctors?

55:33.504 --> 55:36.245
They say it's still
too early to tell.

55:36.289 --> 55:38.073
We have to wait and see.

55:46.647 --> 55:48.345
Now, when we get
to the shark spot,

55:48.388 --> 55:51.565
I need everyone to get in
the water very gently.

55:51.609 --> 55:55.264
Keep your backs against
the hull and sit upright.

55:55.308 --> 55:57.789
I need you to take off all your
jewelry right now because

55:57.832 --> 56:01.488
sometimes sharks will confuse
the glint of your jewelry

56:01.532 --> 56:04.578
with fish scales. It's no good
for anybody.

56:04.622 --> 56:08.930
No touching, no splashing,
no horsing around.

56:08.974 --> 56:12.891
If a shark happens to
nudge you or bite you,

56:12.934 --> 56:14.240
don't freak out.

56:14.283 --> 56:16.503
Dogs usually bite
harder than sharks.

56:16.547 --> 56:18.723
They're just trying
to get your attention.

56:18.766 --> 56:22.901
On the off chance that one does
intend to harm, remember,

56:22.944 --> 56:27.514
the eyes, nose, and gills are
the most sensitive part.

56:27.558 --> 56:33.128
Punch, fight, claw like hell
and get out of the water fast.

56:33.172 --> 56:34.869
Okay? Does anyone have
any questions?

56:36.175 --> 56:37.698
Aren't you scared?

56:37.742 --> 56:42.399
No... Do you know what the
deadliest animals are?

56:42.442 --> 56:44.270
Mosquitoes.

56:44.313 --> 56:48.840
Mosquitoes killed
725,000 people last year.

56:48.883 --> 56:51.320
You wanna know how many
were killed by sharks?

56:51.364 --> 56:52.931
Ten.

56:52.974 --> 56:54.628
And that's compared to
the millions of sharks

56:54.672 --> 56:56.195
that we humans kill each year.

56:56.238 --> 56:59.459
So, no. You're more likely
to be killed by a mosquito

56:59.503 --> 57:01.722
or another human being
than by a shark.

57:01.766 --> 57:04.638
But... I mean your boyfriend.

57:04.682 --> 57:07.728
Aren't you scared
he might come after you?

57:07.772 --> 57:10.035
I'm sorry. I don't think
anyone cares about that.

57:10.078 --> 57:12.603
Actually we were all
thinking about it.

57:12.646 --> 57:16.128
Do you think he did it?

57:16.171 --> 57:18.696
Sorry.. I'm not going to talk
about my personal life here.

57:20.480 --> 57:22.917
Okay, everyone. Let's get our
gear on and go for a dive.

57:22.961 --> 57:24.353
The tanks are right here.

57:30.621 --> 57:32.187
Hey.

57:37.497 --> 57:41.066
Who took my stuff?
Where's my stuff?

57:43.851 --> 57:46.811
I had important papers here.
Who went through my desk?

57:49.161 --> 57:50.771
Where's my stuff?

57:50.815 --> 57:52.904
No, that's okay.
I got it.

57:54.209 --> 57:57.082
Good afternoon.
Have a seat.

57:57.125 --> 57:59.040
I'm fine standing, Chief.
What's going on?

58:02.043 --> 58:03.741
Where were you last night?

58:05.569 --> 58:07.440
- I was at the hospital. Why?
- No, no. After the hospital.

58:07.484 --> 58:08.397
I was having a beer.

58:09.877 --> 58:11.879
Drinking.

58:12.967 --> 58:14.708
I was off the clock.

58:16.841 --> 58:19.583
Look, I'm only doing this
to help you out.

58:19.626 --> 58:22.194
I think this case might
be a little too much for you.

58:22.237 --> 58:24.805
You know, with your
divorce and everything.

58:24.849 --> 58:26.764
You don't have to worry about
me, Chief. I'm fine.

58:26.807 --> 58:29.549
I want you to hand all your
notes over to Detective Brown.

58:29.593 --> 58:31.203
Take a couple days off.

58:31.246 --> 58:32.552
I'm handing the case
over to him.

58:32.596 --> 58:34.902
No. That's uncalled for.
No, no.

58:34.946 --> 58:36.556
I'm about to break this case.

58:36.600 --> 58:38.645
Your about to disobey a direct
order is what your about to do.

58:38.689 --> 58:41.735
No, I am not! This is not right.
You're making a huge mistake.

58:41.779 --> 58:43.868
Listen Ortega, I was taking
down Colombian cartels

58:43.911 --> 58:46.697
while you were still
sucking your mom's tit.

58:46.740 --> 58:49.830
Don't tell me
what's right or wrong.

58:49.874 --> 58:51.876
Last night you left this
office babbling on

58:51.919 --> 58:55.793
about some weird
accounting bullshit.

58:55.836 --> 59:00.275
And today, a reporter does
in five minutes

59:00.319 --> 59:02.451
what you weren't capable
of doing in days.

59:04.105 --> 59:06.151
You're a disgrace to yourself
and to the department

59:06.194 --> 59:07.935
and you're a disgrace to me.

59:07.979 --> 59:10.285
So, now why don't you
get out of my face

59:10.329 --> 59:14.507
before I feed you your teeth
for supper! That's an order.

59:14.551 --> 59:15.987
Get out!

59:16.030 --> 59:16.074
Get out! Now!

59:28.565 --> 59:30.131
Hothead.

59:34.745 --> 59:36.616
I think he took that well.

01:00:27.449 --> 01:00:29.103
Hello?

01:00:46.338 --> 01:00:47.644
Shane?

01:00:48.383 --> 01:00:50.037
Is that you?

01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:23.114
I am standing here,
outside the parking lot of

01:01:23.157 --> 01:01:26.944
Jackson Memorial Hospital
where, according to doctors,

01:01:26.987 --> 01:01:31.383
Kelly Jacobson who was allegedly
run over by Shane Allen King

01:01:31.426 --> 01:01:35.387
a few days ago has
regained full consciousness.

01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:38.390
Police are with her right
now taking her statement.

01:01:38.433 --> 01:01:41.349
She is expected to be
released later today.

01:01:41.393 --> 01:01:45.353
Her testimony may be key in
putting Shane away for murder.

01:01:50.141 --> 01:01:52.012
Do you recall anything else?

01:01:53.274 --> 01:01:55.799
No.
That's all I can remember.

01:01:55.842 --> 01:01:57.844
Are you sure?

01:02:00.194 --> 01:02:01.979
Are you sure?

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:05.025
Yes, I'm sure.

01:02:08.942 --> 01:02:12.206
What happened to the other detective
that was investigating the case?

01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:14.731
The case was
reassigned to me, ma'am.

01:02:14.774 --> 01:02:17.211
So, why is the man who did
this still on the streets?

01:02:17.255 --> 01:02:19.910
Why isn't he in jail?

01:02:19.953 --> 01:02:22.086
That's what we're
trying to do, ma'am.

01:02:22.869 --> 01:02:24.653
We'll be in touch.

01:02:39.843 --> 01:02:41.801
Thank you very much.

01:02:44.238 --> 01:02:46.110
Easy does it. Easy.

01:02:46.153 --> 01:02:47.459
Here we go. The car's
right over there.

01:02:47.502 --> 01:02:49.548
Psst! Kelly!

01:02:49.591 --> 01:02:52.943
It's okay. Are you alright?
What are you doing here?

01:02:52.986 --> 01:02:54.814
Please. Kelly we need to talk?

01:02:54.858 --> 01:02:56.598
Leave us alone.

01:02:56.642 --> 01:03:00.864
- Mom.
- It's okay. We're almost there.

01:03:05.477 --> 01:03:07.435
Anne, listen to me.

01:03:07.479 --> 01:03:08.915
Leave us alone or
I'm calling the cops.

01:03:08.959 --> 01:03:11.788
Anne, you don't understand.

01:03:11.831 --> 01:03:13.485
Anne, please!

01:03:14.573 --> 01:03:16.314
You have no shame!

01:03:25.192 --> 01:03:28.065
Let's go... Let's go... shoot!

01:03:32.504 --> 01:03:35.202
Excuse me.
Sir, excuse me.

01:03:35.986 --> 01:03:36.987
Wait!

01:03:40.991 --> 01:03:42.340
Ugh!

01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:46.344
Shoot... shoot!

01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:52.959
Ok, ready?

01:04:20.682 --> 01:04:24.121
These images where taken just
moments after Kelly's car

01:04:24.164 --> 01:04:26.688
exploded in the parking lot.

01:04:26.732 --> 01:04:29.517
As you can see in this footage,
there appears to be a man

01:04:29.561 --> 01:04:32.085
running away from the scene.

01:04:32.129 --> 01:04:35.088
Authorities are now looking at
security camera footage

01:04:35.132 --> 01:04:37.917
trying to figure out
who that man was.

01:04:40.702 --> 01:04:42.052
What are you doing here?

01:04:42.095 --> 01:04:43.444
What do you mean?
I live here.

01:04:43.488 --> 01:04:45.446
Where have you been?

01:04:45.490 --> 01:04:46.970
Put the knife down.
You're making me nervous.

01:04:47.013 --> 01:04:49.668
I've been calling you and
calling you. I've been worried.

01:04:49.711 --> 01:04:51.191
I know. I'm sorry.

01:04:51.235 --> 01:04:52.540
I think you need to leave.

01:04:52.584 --> 01:04:53.933
I can't.
I have nowhere else to go.

01:04:53.977 --> 01:04:55.761
I feel like I barely know you.

01:04:55.804 --> 01:04:58.155
Cam, you're the
only one who does.

01:04:58.198 --> 01:05:00.157
Shane, it's over.
Take it!

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.420
No, Cam. I won't accept this.
Where are you going?

01:05:02.463 --> 01:05:03.900
If you're not leaving.
I am.

01:05:03.943 --> 01:05:05.553
- You can't leave.
- Of course, I can.

01:05:05.597 --> 01:05:07.425
Stop. Sit down!

01:05:12.734 --> 01:05:14.954
Kelly and Maria are dead.

01:05:14.998 --> 01:05:16.521
If you go outside, you're next.

01:05:32.450 --> 01:05:36.410
The people who are trying to
frame me, are dangerous.

01:05:36.454 --> 01:05:38.804
I will not let anything
happen to you.

01:05:42.503 --> 01:05:43.809
Hello.

01:05:45.115 --> 01:05:47.030
You can't hold me
here against my will.

01:05:49.032 --> 01:05:50.990
Don't you see
what's going on, Cameron?

01:05:51.034 --> 01:05:53.427
They've turning everyone
against me. Even you.

01:05:53.471 --> 01:05:55.560
So, what are you gonna do,
Shane?

01:05:55.603 --> 01:05:57.127
What's your plan?

01:05:57.170 --> 01:05:59.607
Are you just going me
in this house forever?

01:06:01.044 --> 01:06:02.741
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

01:06:02.784 --> 01:06:05.744
Dispatch, I need a unit.
1975 NE 23rd street!

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:24.981
I have to think. There has
to be some way out of this.

01:06:26.895 --> 01:06:29.376
What are you doing?

01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:30.682
Are you trying to call someone?

01:06:30.725 --> 01:06:33.511
No! what's wrong with you?

01:06:33.554 --> 01:06:37.167
- You're so paranoid!
- I know, I'm sorry.

01:06:37.210 --> 01:06:38.951
I'm going crazy.

01:06:42.868 --> 01:06:44.783
Listen...

01:06:48.482 --> 01:06:51.616
there was this guy...
Pedro.

01:06:53.052 --> 01:06:57.317
He was a nice guy,
he worked at the docks

01:06:57.361 --> 01:06:59.798
while he was working there, he found
out that his five-year-old son

01:06:59.841 --> 01:07:02.975
was diagnosed with cancer.

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:08.415
Now, he needed to work some extra
hours to pay for treatments.

01:07:08.459 --> 01:07:12.289
Union laws wouldn't let him log
any extra hours so he came to me

01:07:12.332 --> 01:07:15.074
to see if he could work
on his cousin's name.

01:07:17.424 --> 01:07:20.036
Now, I know this was illegal

01:07:20.079 --> 01:07:23.300
but I felt bad for him
and I let him do it.

01:07:24.736 --> 01:07:27.086
And one day, I don't know...

01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:33.092
he was tired and he accidentally
got killed by a fork lift.

01:07:33.136 --> 01:07:35.094
That's horrible.

01:07:37.444 --> 01:07:40.317
I don't see how this
ties into Maria and Kelly.

01:07:41.535 --> 01:07:42.536
There was a police
investigation.

01:07:44.712 --> 01:07:47.541
I think you forgot to pick me
up from work today.

01:07:59.423 --> 01:08:02.469
I'm done.
I'm going clean.

01:08:02.513 --> 01:08:04.776
The head detective in charge,

01:08:04.819 --> 01:08:07.213
detective Garbaccio...

01:08:07.257 --> 01:08:10.042
Relax. You gonna
turn into a baby.

01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:11.478
I mean, you've been doing
this for years.

01:08:11.522 --> 01:08:13.089
He figured out my involvement.

01:08:13.132 --> 01:08:15.047
He threatened to hold me
personally accountable

01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:18.877
for Pedro's death.
Unless I did him a favor.

01:08:20.661 --> 01:08:21.749
- Did you tell anyone about this?
- No, I kept my mouth shut. I

01:08:21.792 --> 01:08:23.273
You didn't tell your
girlfriend...

01:08:23.316 --> 01:08:26.276
the diver... what's her name?

01:08:26.319 --> 01:08:30.106
Why would I tell my girlfriend?
What she has to do with this?

01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:32.934
It's hard to find nice
girls like her these days.

01:08:32.978 --> 01:08:35.023
You don't want
anything to happen to her.

01:08:35.067 --> 01:08:37.156
Are you threatening me?

01:08:41.725 --> 01:08:43.292
Don't do anything stupid.

01:08:50.734 --> 01:08:52.737
What did you do, Shane?

01:08:55.218 --> 01:09:00.136
Alll did, was alter the
shipping records.

01:09:00.179 --> 01:09:02.312
So that whenever a
container disappeared,

01:09:02.354 --> 01:09:05.053
I made it look like they were
never there in the first place.

01:09:07.273 --> 01:09:09.710
That's what Monica was
going to reveal on TV,

01:09:09.754 --> 01:09:12.886
and I agreed to meet with her.

01:09:12.930 --> 01:09:15.238
But when I did, I don't know, I
guess that Garbaccio found out

01:09:15.281 --> 01:09:17.109
and he sent a group of
thugs to jump me

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:19.676
and he told me to
keep my mouth shut.

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:22.854
That's why Kelly and
Maria were murdered.

01:09:24.769 --> 01:09:29.381
What about all those envelopes
of cash I found in the basement?

01:09:29.426 --> 01:09:32.211
That's my money.

01:09:32.255 --> 01:09:34.953
I put it aside every
month for Pedro's family.

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:38.696
Why didn't you just
tell me all this?

01:09:40.001 --> 01:09:43.353
I wanted too, but I was ashamed.

01:09:45.224 --> 01:09:47.095
Then, after what happened to
Kelly and Maria I thought that

01:09:47.139 --> 01:09:48.923
if I told you I might be
putting you in danger.

01:09:52.318 --> 01:09:54.233
You have to tell someone.

01:09:54.277 --> 01:09:58.237
I can't. I can't.

01:09:58.281 --> 01:10:00.283
It's too dangerous.

01:10:01.153 --> 01:10:02.546
We have to disappear.

01:10:02.589 --> 01:10:05.288
Shane, running is gonna
make you look more guilty.

01:10:05.331 --> 01:10:06.854
I have no choice.

01:10:16.647 --> 01:10:18.126
Who's that?

01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:21.434
Who's that?

01:10:26.439 --> 01:10:28.006
How do they know I'm here?

01:10:28.049 --> 01:10:29.877
- I called them.
- Why? Why would you do that?

01:10:29.921 --> 01:10:31.879
I'm sorry.

01:10:33.141 --> 01:10:34.012
Come on.
We can escape through the back.

01:10:34.055 --> 01:10:35.535
Shane, don't.

01:10:57.601 --> 01:10:59.820
Hey, hey hey!
Suspect on foot!

01:11:08.394 --> 01:11:11.919
Shane... Shane.

01:11:13.617 --> 01:11:15.749
Stop, stop.

01:11:17.447 --> 01:11:18.752
Stop!

01:11:20.537 --> 01:11:21.929
Shane.

01:11:26.151 --> 01:11:30.068
Put your hands up, turn around,
get on your knees. Now.

01:11:39.251 --> 01:11:40.992
You're lucky I didn't shoot you.
You know that?

01:11:44.343 --> 01:11:45.475
Shane!

01:12:18.421 --> 01:12:20.336
You look like crap.

01:12:20.379 --> 01:12:21.728
Thanks.

01:12:23.121 --> 01:12:24.165
You know that stuff you
told me last night.

01:12:24.209 --> 01:12:27.212
It's all true.

01:12:27.255 --> 01:12:31.564
There has to be someone I can
call who can verify your story.

01:12:31.608 --> 01:12:33.566
Shh.

01:12:33.610 --> 01:12:35.089
It's not safe.

01:12:40.268 --> 01:12:42.619
Remember the engagement
gift I gave you.

01:12:44.055 --> 01:12:45.752
The one I said might
come in handy someday.

01:12:45.796 --> 01:12:47.101
You should take
another look at it.

01:12:47.145 --> 01:12:48.799
- The...
- Yes.

01:12:50.496 --> 01:12:53.630
- Ok. What is it?
- Leverage.

01:12:53.673 --> 01:12:55.414
I gotta go.

01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:18.889
Hello?

01:14:18.932 --> 01:14:21.413
- Hi, is this Cameron?
- Yes. Who's this?

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:24.198
Yeah, look... My name's Manny.
I work with Shane at the docks.

01:14:24.242 --> 01:14:25.635
I really think we should meet.

01:14:25.678 --> 01:14:26.984
What's this about?

01:14:27.027 --> 01:14:29.421
No... I can't talk on the phone.

01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:30.727
Can you be here
in thirty minutes?

01:14:30.770 --> 01:14:32.206
Yes.

01:14:32.250 --> 01:14:33.991
But how do I know
I can trust you?

01:14:34.034 --> 01:14:35.645
You don't.

01:14:35.688 --> 01:14:36.994
See you soon.

01:14:46.873 --> 01:14:48.527
You have to come.

01:14:48.571 --> 01:14:49.833
He might know the truth.

01:14:49.876 --> 01:14:51.182
Cameron, it's over.

01:14:51.225 --> 01:14:52.836
There's nothing else
you can do for him.

01:14:52.879 --> 01:14:56.187
No. You have to believe me.
Shane is innocent.

01:14:56.230 --> 01:14:59.407
Ok... Even if that's so, how do
you know this isn't a trap?

01:14:59.451 --> 01:15:01.584
What if he's just luring you
out there to kill you?

01:15:01.627 --> 01:15:03.324
That's why I need you to come.

01:15:03.368 --> 01:15:06.066
If you bring your camera
and record the meeting,

01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:07.459
it might protect me.

01:15:07.503 --> 01:15:09.287
My camera can't protect you.

01:15:09.330 --> 01:15:12.464
I couldn't protect Maria
orKelly and It definitely

01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:15.423
can't protect you. Now,
please, just think about this.

01:15:15.467 --> 01:15:16.599
It's crazy.

01:15:16.642 --> 01:15:17.948
I know,

01:15:17.991 --> 01:15:20.167
but crazy is all I got left.

01:15:45.758 --> 01:15:49.414
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:15:49.457 --> 01:15:52.199
I heard what happened to Shane.

01:15:52.243 --> 01:15:53.766
That ain't right.

01:15:55.028 --> 01:15:57.030
- He didn't do it.
- How do you know?

01:15:57.074 --> 01:15:59.511
I was there when
he made the deal.

01:17:13.193 --> 01:17:15.413
- Is she dead?
- I don't know.

01:17:15.456 --> 01:17:16.762
What do you mean you don't know?

01:17:16.806 --> 01:17:18.372
Honey, relax.

01:17:18.416 --> 01:17:20.810
I shot Manny,
then I fired twice at her

01:17:20.853 --> 01:17:22.333
and she jumped in the water
and she could have drowned.

01:17:22.376 --> 01:17:24.248
I don't know.

01:17:24.291 --> 01:17:26.946
If she's still alive, Detective
Brown will take care of it.

01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:28.905
No! He had his shot.
He screwed it up.

01:17:28.948 --> 01:17:31.516
You've already over exposed.

01:17:31.559 --> 01:17:34.693
You know how many people know
came in contact with her.

01:17:34.737 --> 01:17:37.043
How long you think it going to
take them to figure out that

01:17:37.087 --> 01:17:41.395
you reached out to them
just before they died.

01:17:41.439 --> 01:17:44.311
People believe what I
want them to believe.

01:17:46.487 --> 01:17:50.840
Oh, my god.
You are arrogant and naive.

01:17:50.883 --> 01:17:53.843
You know what you are?
You're lucky.

01:17:53.886 --> 01:17:55.540
You know why you're lucky?

01:17:55.583 --> 01:17:57.020
Of course, you don't.

01:17:57.063 --> 01:17:58.761
You're lucky 'cause you
have someone to pin it on,

01:17:58.804 --> 01:18:01.024
now if Shane is in jail
or he's dead,

01:18:01.067 --> 01:18:03.679
what are you gonna
do then, genius?

01:18:05.115 --> 01:18:06.507
What are you saying, Dad?

01:18:06.551 --> 01:18:08.727
That I shouldn't have done this?

01:18:08.771 --> 01:18:10.860
I did this for you,
to protect you.

01:18:10.903 --> 01:18:12.209
I never asked you
to do any of this!

01:18:12.252 --> 01:18:13.863
And I never asked you to steal.

01:18:13.906 --> 01:18:15.299
Oh, no?

01:18:15.342 --> 01:18:17.301
How else was I gonna spoil you?

01:18:17.344 --> 01:18:20.565
With your degrees, and
your trips, and your cars,

01:18:20.608 --> 01:18:23.307
and your Europe...
and your boyfriends,

01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:25.396
and your spending money
and all this bullshit!

01:18:25.439 --> 01:18:27.572
Are you seriously saying
you did this for me?

01:18:27.615 --> 01:18:29.095
- Yes.
- No.

01:18:29.139 --> 01:18:31.315
You paid me to protect your
image and your marriage,

01:18:31.358 --> 01:18:32.969
not for me.

01:18:34.927 --> 01:18:38.844
All I'm saying is let
Detective Brown do his job.

01:18:38.888 --> 01:18:42.805
I would hate it if any
of this came back on you.

01:18:45.198 --> 01:18:48.027
You're just afraid
they'll trace it back to you.

01:18:54.947 --> 01:18:57.776
Hey, Cameron, it's me, Monica.

01:18:57.820 --> 01:19:00.300
Give me a call as
soon as you get this.

01:19:00.344 --> 01:19:02.041
I've discovered something
that can help Shane.

01:19:41.472 --> 01:19:42.778
Hello?

01:19:42.821 --> 01:19:44.301
Monica, it's me, Cameron.

01:19:44.344 --> 01:19:45.911
Cameron, where have you been?

01:19:45.955 --> 01:19:47.521
I called you like a thousand
times. Did you get my messages?

01:19:47.565 --> 01:19:50.002
I know.
I lost my phone.

01:19:50.046 --> 01:19:51.221
How did it go with Manny?

01:19:54.964 --> 01:19:56.269
Manny's dead.

01:19:56.313 --> 01:19:57.749
What? How?

01:19:57.793 --> 01:19:59.620
He was shot.

01:19:59.664 --> 01:20:02.406
That's terrible.
Are you okay? Where are you?

01:20:02.449 --> 01:20:03.842
I'm at my boat.

01:20:03.886 --> 01:20:05.409
What are you doing there?

01:20:05.452 --> 01:20:07.585
I didn't feel safe going home.

01:20:07.628 --> 01:20:08.673
Are you alone?

01:20:08.716 --> 01:20:09.979
Yes.

01:20:10.022 --> 01:20:11.241
Why don't you come
over to my house?

01:20:11.284 --> 01:20:14.461
- I can help you.
- No, no.

01:20:14.505 --> 01:20:16.159
Okay.
Then I'll go to you.

01:20:16.202 --> 01:20:17.813
I have something
you have to see.

01:20:17.856 --> 01:20:19.031
What is it?

01:20:19.075 --> 01:20:21.599
It's something
that can help Shane.

01:20:22.948 --> 01:20:24.558
Do you know where
my diving school is?

01:20:24.602 --> 01:20:26.560
Yes.

01:20:26.604 --> 01:20:27.866
I'll wait for you here.

01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:29.346
Okay. Perfect.

01:20:50.976 --> 01:20:52.543
What happened?

01:20:52.586 --> 01:20:54.153
I don't know.
We were just standing there,

01:20:54.197 --> 01:20:55.981
in the middle of no where and
someone started shooting at us.

01:20:56.025 --> 01:20:57.591
Did you call the police?

01:20:57.635 --> 01:21:00.507
Yeah, I called but I ran
away before they got there.

01:21:00.551 --> 01:21:01.857
Who else did you
tell about this?

01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:04.381
- No one. Just you.
- Alright. Good.

01:21:07.601 --> 01:21:10.082
- What are you doing?
- You like diving don't you?

01:21:10.126 --> 01:21:12.955
Let's see how long you
can hold your breath. Get on.

01:21:15.566 --> 01:21:17.046
Move.

01:21:26.838 --> 01:21:29.623
You know you're going
to need me to sail back.

01:21:29.667 --> 01:21:32.061
Nice try. I'll wait for
the coast guards.

01:21:32.104 --> 01:21:35.020
And what are you gonna tell
them? You stole my boat?

01:21:35.064 --> 01:21:37.501
It's not going to be so easy.

01:21:37.544 --> 01:21:39.938
These people don't
work for your Daddy.

01:21:39.982 --> 01:21:41.505
You know.

01:21:43.202 --> 01:21:45.378
You were the only person who
knew where Shane was going

01:21:45.422 --> 01:21:48.164
the night Kelly was run over.

01:21:48.207 --> 01:21:50.949
You arranged for him to have
his car smashed.

01:21:50.993 --> 01:21:52.864
You killed all of them.

01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:55.649
Even Manny.

01:21:55.693 --> 01:21:58.043
I should have known the second you
walked into Garbaccio's office.

01:21:58.087 --> 01:21:59.479
Good job.

01:21:59.523 --> 01:22:00.741
If only you would've
figured it out sooner,

01:22:00.785 --> 01:22:02.221
maybe you could have saved them.

01:22:02.265 --> 01:22:03.919
But I'm afraid it's too late.

01:22:07.096 --> 01:22:09.533
Well, it's too late for
your father, too.

01:22:09.576 --> 01:22:11.100
Before you got here,

01:22:11.143 --> 01:22:14.146
I emailed everything on this
flash drive to my sister.

01:22:14.190 --> 01:22:16.105
I told her If anything
happens to me

01:22:16.148 --> 01:22:19.456
she's to forward it to
every TV station in the country.

01:22:19.499 --> 01:22:21.588
What's on it?

01:22:21.632 --> 01:22:25.897
It's a recording of your
father's meeting with Shane.

01:22:25.941 --> 01:22:27.768
I don't believe you.
Give me the drive.

01:22:27.812 --> 01:22:29.379
You want it?

01:22:44.437 --> 01:22:45.656
It's over.

01:22:51.183 --> 01:22:52.445
Monica!

01:22:52.489 --> 01:22:54.273
Drop the gun!

01:22:54.317 --> 01:22:56.493
Monica, drop it.

01:23:01.889 --> 01:23:03.413
It's the police!

01:23:09.723 --> 01:23:12.335
According to authorities,
reporter Monica Gordon

01:23:12.378 --> 01:23:15.468
attempted to kill Cameron
in order to hide incriminating

01:23:15.512 --> 01:23:17.949
evidence against her
father, Chief Garbaccio,

01:23:17.993 --> 01:23:21.387
and his band of corrupt officers
who where bringing drugs

01:23:21.431 --> 01:23:23.737
into the country
through the Port.

01:23:23.781 --> 01:23:26.436
Every month someone would come
and steal a container

01:23:26.479 --> 01:23:28.394
and I would tamper
with the reports.

01:23:28.438 --> 01:23:31.049
The testimonies
given by Detective Ortega,

01:23:31.093 --> 01:23:35.010
Shane King, and video recovered
from a broken flash drive

01:23:35.053 --> 01:23:37.490
have been crucial in
bringing down a network

01:23:37.534 --> 01:23:40.667
of corrupt law enforcement
officials headed by Garbaccio.

01:23:43.844 --> 01:23:45.629
I'll wait for you.

01:23:47.196 --> 01:23:48.849
You're my true north.

01:23:56.901 --> 01:23:59.338
There's nothing like
descending on a shipwreck.

01:24:01.210 --> 01:24:03.386
It's like uncovering a mystery.

01:24:05.170 --> 01:24:07.651
Who was on board when she
was swallowed up by the sea?

01:24:07.694 --> 01:24:10.480
What were they
doing when it happened?

01:24:10.523 --> 01:24:13.744
And most importantly,
why did they go down?

01:24:19.793 --> 01:24:23.536
Most people never expect bad
things to happen to them

01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:25.582
until they do.

01:24:25.625 --> 01:24:28.933
So, always
prepare for the worst,

01:24:28.976 --> 01:24:33.764
but if that day comes,
fight like hell,

01:24:33.807 --> 01:24:36.158
'cause it's never too late.
