[Payton] Previously
on Make It Or Break It:

00:07.608 --> 00:08.942
[Kaylie] So, that's it?
You're just giving up?

00:08.976 --> 00:11.579
- This divorce has
nothing to do with you.
- I am your daughter!

00:11.612 --> 00:15.583
Your decision to end
your marriage should have
everything to do with me!

00:15.616 --> 00:18.452
[Payton] I know something's
wrong with your health.

00:18.486 --> 00:20.588
Just tell me the truth.

00:20.621 --> 00:24.358
Something is wrong.
I don't know what it is,
and I'm scared, Pay.

00:24.392 --> 00:26.227
Then we go to a doctor
together.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.461
Who is that horrible woman?

00:27.495 --> 00:29.597
It's Kelly Parker's
mana-monster.

00:29.630 --> 00:32.533
Manager-slash-mother-
slash-monster.

00:32.566 --> 00:35.069
You promised you were going
to take care of Kaylie,
and did you?

00:35.103 --> 00:36.237
No, you couldn't.

00:36.270 --> 00:38.539
I sacrificed everything
to make you a star.

00:38.572 --> 00:40.608
I think I may have
to drop you as my client.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.376
Mom, please!

00:42.643 --> 00:43.644
Mom!

00:45.313 --> 00:46.514
[up-tempo music plays]

00:49.550 --> 00:52.086
* Light up the sky
Burn it up like a candle *

00:52.120 --> 00:53.621
* When life gets hard...
[music distorts]

00:53.654 --> 00:55.623
* All you need
is love and a boombox *

00:55.656 --> 00:58.392
* To make this world rockin'
until the groove stops *

01:02.396 --> 01:05.233
* Stayin' out late livin'
under the street lights *

01:05.266 --> 01:07.468
* Workin' all night
You sleep in the free time *

01:07.501 --> 01:09.337
* Savin' your bread till
the time that you need it *

01:09.370 --> 01:11.539
* You want it so hard you can
see that we're bleedin' *

01:11.572 --> 01:13.574
* We are young and we're free

01:13.607 --> 01:16.410
* Only thing that we need

01:16.444 --> 01:20.848
* Is a moment
to be good later on *

01:20.881 --> 01:22.850
* We want to ignite

01:22.883 --> 01:25.319
* Burn a hole in the sky

01:25.353 --> 01:26.420
* You and I, we...

01:26.454 --> 01:29.123
And I'll talk about the gymnasts
who came before you

01:29.157 --> 01:32.460
and that you'll have
the chance to make history
just like they did.

01:32.493 --> 01:36.330
And that'll end
the presentation, all right?

01:36.364 --> 01:39.400
Kaylie, since Wendy had
to attend the TC seminar

01:39.433 --> 01:40.668
for junior athletes
this weekend,

01:40.701 --> 01:44.272
I've decided you'll be the one
to say something to the parents.

01:44.305 --> 01:47.641
You'll be speaking for all
the girls, so make us proud.

01:47.675 --> 01:49.610
I know you all are hoping

01:49.643 --> 01:51.579
to impress your folks
this Sunday,

01:51.612 --> 01:54.248
but the person you
better impress is me.

01:54.282 --> 01:55.616
So keep your head in the game

01:55.649 --> 01:58.619
and be ready to rehearse
the entire exhibition
at three tomorrow.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.588
I expect your routines
to be perfect.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.323
And don't forget
to tell the coordinator

02:02.356 --> 02:04.492
how many guests you have
coming to the performance.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.661
All right.

02:11.632 --> 02:14.468
Hey.
What happened out there?

02:14.502 --> 02:18.172
This routine is
way more artistic
than I'm used to.

02:18.206 --> 02:20.541
I'm still struggling
with those tumbling moves.

02:20.574 --> 02:24.278
Listen, even the most seasoned
gymnast can get intimidated

02:24.312 --> 02:26.380
when they have to perform
for just the people
they're closest to.

02:27.615 --> 02:28.682
Never been a problem for me.

02:29.617 --> 02:31.452
Who do you have coming?

02:31.485 --> 02:34.455
Um, I invited the foster parents
I lived with in Baltimore.

02:34.488 --> 02:37.458
They're the only ones
I keep in contact with.

02:37.491 --> 02:40.194
Hmm. How long
since you've seen them?

02:41.629 --> 02:45.599
I don't know. Like,
seven... eight years.

02:45.633 --> 02:48.736
Look, coach, um, I should
really get going, so see ya.

02:50.571 --> 02:54.608
I can't believe your mom
was cool with you firing her
as your manager.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.744
Things have been
pretty rocky since Worlds.

02:56.777 --> 02:57.945
She must have seen it coming.

02:57.978 --> 03:01.615
How long has it been
since your mom has
just been your mom?

03:01.649 --> 03:03.684
I can't even remember.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.419
I know she can be difficult,

03:05.453 --> 03:07.588
but when she's not
all about business,

03:07.621 --> 03:09.257
she's really not that bad.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.226
This weekend could be
a whole new start for us.

03:12.260 --> 03:14.362
I'm actually really excited.

03:14.395 --> 03:15.763
So, how about your father?

03:15.796 --> 03:17.765
What kind of relationship
do you have with him?

03:17.798 --> 03:20.234
I see my dentist
more than I see my dad.

03:20.268 --> 03:24.505
- Why? What happened?
- Just, after the divorce
my parents kept on fighting.

03:24.538 --> 03:25.973
And I was just always
stuck in the middle.

03:26.006 --> 03:27.708
[scoffs] Been there, done that.

03:27.741 --> 03:30.778
In the beginning, I spent
every other weekend with my dad.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.746
But the more time
that gymnastics took up,

03:32.780 --> 03:35.783
the less I got to see him.
And then he got remarried.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.752
His new wife had
kids of her own, so...

03:38.786 --> 03:40.654
- You know how that goes.
- Hmm.

03:40.688 --> 03:41.655
Well, I'll see you
back at the room.

03:41.689 --> 03:43.324
OK, bye.

03:52.666 --> 03:55.669
I hate that my dad can
only be here for a few hours
tomorrow night.

03:55.703 --> 03:58.439
We're going to miss out on
so much valuable shopping time!

03:58.472 --> 03:59.807
You know what would be
a much better use
of your valuable time?

03:59.840 --> 04:01.309
Seeing a doctor!

04:01.342 --> 04:03.311
News flash: I'm going to get
a complete physical,

04:03.344 --> 04:05.679
just like I promised,
right after London.

04:05.713 --> 04:08.382
I figured you would try
and play me, which is why
I made an appointment for you

04:08.416 --> 04:10.418
- with the TC doctor.
- Here?!

04:10.451 --> 04:13.387
He's just right
around the corner.
Noon tomorrow. Be there!

04:13.854 --> 04:15.022
[scoffs]

04:15.055 --> 04:17.425
Payson, please don't do this!

04:17.458 --> 04:19.827
I can't stand by any longer
and let you risk your life.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.729
There could be something
seriously wrong with you,

04:21.762 --> 04:22.930
and you need
to deal with it now!

04:22.963 --> 04:25.533
If the TC gets wind
of a health problem,
they'll pull me.

04:25.566 --> 04:28.369
Come on. You of all people
should know how that works.

04:28.402 --> 04:31.872
I swear I'll find a doctor.
It just has to be someone
on the outside.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.709
OK, but if you don't have it
lined up by tomorrow,

04:35.743 --> 04:38.746
I swear I will
personally drag you
into the TC doctor myself.

04:39.747 --> 04:40.648
OK.

04:41.549 --> 04:42.883
OK.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.488
[crowd cheering]

04:55.496 --> 04:57.798
Like I don't have
enough pressure to deal with?

04:57.831 --> 05:01.335
Now I have to come up
with something fabulous
to say to the parents!

05:01.369 --> 05:03.404
Feel free to borrow
any of my catchphrases.

05:03.437 --> 05:06.774
I don't think,
"Yo, amigo, leggo my ego,"

05:06.807 --> 05:08.776
is exactly what the coach
had in mind.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.611
Hey, where's
your sense of humor?

05:10.644 --> 05:13.781
Stressed out,
just like the rest of me.

05:13.814 --> 05:18.519
Every minute I'm in that gym,
I'm being judged.
It's crazy-making.

05:19.887 --> 05:22.790
And I hate that I don't have
Payson in my corner anymore.

05:23.857 --> 05:26.126
- Come here.
- [mutters]

05:26.159 --> 05:27.027
Tell me what's going on.

05:28.796 --> 05:31.131
Ever since she found out
I knew it was Lauren

05:31.164 --> 05:35.669
who sent the kiss cam picture
to the NGO, she's been
completely avoiding me.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.671
You guys will get over it.

05:37.705 --> 05:40.641
- I'm not so sure.
- OK, forget about all that.

05:40.674 --> 05:44.412
Your parents
will be here this weekend.
That'll cheer you up.

05:44.445 --> 05:47.648
Hardly. I'm gonna be playing
referee at dinner.

05:47.681 --> 05:48.916
It's just more pressure.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.751
My focus needs to be
on gymnastics,

05:50.784 --> 05:52.886
not my parents' grudge match.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.889
Well, how can I help?

05:55.923 --> 05:58.426
Well, hmm...

06:00.961 --> 06:03.897
Any interest
in going to dinner with us?

06:03.931 --> 06:06.534
It might force them to be
on their best behavior.

06:07.901 --> 06:10.671
- I'm in.
- Really?

06:10.704 --> 06:15.175
I mean, I know my dad
hasn't been exactly
warm and fuzzy to you.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.177
But you have.

06:17.210 --> 06:20.481
And I want to be there for you,
whenever, whatever.

06:29.823 --> 06:34.428
Oh, there he is!
The man, the legend!

06:34.462 --> 06:38.766
Coach McIntire, it is so great
to finally meet you.

06:38.799 --> 06:41.902
I'm Sheila Baboyon.
I'm Kelly Parker's mom.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.471
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes!

06:43.504 --> 06:48.476
Boy, what a brilliant idea
to invite the parents
right before the exhibition.

06:48.509 --> 06:51.479
You know, it gives the folks
whose daughters may not
be here in a week or two

06:51.512 --> 06:52.846
a chance to see them perform.
That's nice.

06:52.880 --> 06:58.452
That's not really the reason
for this weekend.

06:58.486 --> 07:01.889
We're at the halfway point,
and I know some of the girls
are feeling homesick.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.958
That is so true,
and it's so nice. Really.

07:04.992 --> 07:07.928
- I know how much
I miss Kelly.
- Oh.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.731
And she misses me.
I'm sorry.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.834
You know, it's just
that we're extremely close
and it's been a couple of weeks.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.703
You know? [sniffles]

07:15.736 --> 07:19.607
Oh, God, I was so excited to
see her perform tomorrow and...

07:19.640 --> 07:22.943
I just can't bear to tell her
I'm not gonna be here
to support her.

07:22.976 --> 07:25.879
- [stammers] Wait.
Why aren't you staying?
- [Sheila sighs]

07:25.913 --> 07:29.249
There's no room
at the inn... literally.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.952
I mean, who knew
the Shriners were in town?

07:31.985 --> 07:36.757
I tried every hotel, motel,
hostel... Everything's booked.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.498
The coach invited you
to stay at his house?!

07:44.532 --> 07:46.266
I know. Isn't it great?

07:46.299 --> 07:49.903
I mean, you know, and I insisted
on making him a home cooked meal

07:49.937 --> 07:50.904
to thank him
for his hospitality.

07:50.938 --> 07:53.006
- You don't
even know how to cook.
- Mm.

07:53.040 --> 07:56.510
And besides, it was supposed
to be just us at dinner tonight.

07:56.544 --> 08:00.648
It will be just us, beauty.
It'll just be the three of us.

08:00.681 --> 08:01.682
- Mom?
- What?

08:01.715 --> 08:03.784
You're not my manager anymore!

08:03.817 --> 08:05.519
I don't want to go
to a business dinner.

08:05.553 --> 08:08.055
I have no intention of making
this a business dinner.

08:08.088 --> 08:12.593
This man is in charge of you,
my angel, my precious baby.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.928
This dinner is so I can
get to know him better

08:14.962 --> 08:18.699
to make sure
that you are in good hands.

08:19.567 --> 08:20.801
- OK?
- OK.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.903
Now, go get your bag. I'm gonna
go buy you a dress for tonight.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.972
Anything you want.
Something pretty. OK?

08:25.005 --> 08:27.040
- OK.
- All right, baby.

08:33.914 --> 08:36.049
Yes, this is Sheila Baboyon.
Mm-hm.

08:36.083 --> 08:38.819
I wanna cancel
my room reservation for tonight.

08:41.589 --> 08:42.956
Where did you get that?

08:42.990 --> 08:45.659
Where you get everything?
The Internet. Duh.

08:45.693 --> 08:47.928
Are you using this
to buy alcohol?

08:47.961 --> 08:51.031
No! I got it because I thought
you had to be 18 to get Botox.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.032
Tell me you didn't!

08:52.065 --> 08:54.001
[exhales] I didn't.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.069
The dermatologist
refused to give it to me.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.772
He said, "Come back
in 20 years. Blah, blah."

08:58.806 --> 09:03.611
But it's lucky I still have it.
If I use a fake ID and cash,

09:03.644 --> 09:06.714
then there's no way
anyone here will find out
about my doctor's appointment.

09:06.747 --> 09:09.082
OK, but then I want you
to dump this thing.

09:09.116 --> 09:11.018
Yes, Officer Keeler.

09:11.051 --> 09:14.321
Oh, and I found out that
the university medical center
takes walk-ins,

09:14.354 --> 09:16.724
- so I figured we'd go
tomorrow after practice...
- No!

09:16.757 --> 09:18.626
I said today, Lauren!

09:18.659 --> 09:21.995
We'd have to change buses
three times to get
to the medical center.

09:22.029 --> 09:25.766
And we'd never make it back
in time for rehearsal
this afternoon.

09:25.799 --> 09:28.101
If we had a car,
it wouldn't take so long.

09:28.135 --> 09:29.002
But we don't.

09:29.036 --> 09:32.806
But we could...
if I borrow my dad's car.

09:32.840 --> 09:35.876
Aren't you two supposed
to go to lunch together?

09:35.909 --> 09:37.911
Plans change.

09:41.181 --> 09:44.618
So good to see you.
Where's Kim?

09:44.652 --> 09:47.020
The Rock team is
at a competition
in Fort Collins.

09:47.054 --> 09:47.955
She's chaperoning.

09:47.988 --> 09:50.157
I bet she's disappointed
not to see Payson.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.125
She is.

09:52.159 --> 09:55.663
I haven't told Payson,
you know, what we discussed,

09:55.696 --> 09:57.898
so if you could just avoid
mentioning anything to Kaylie...

09:57.931 --> 10:00.167
Of course.
I won't say anything.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.069
She's a big girl now, Mark.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.104
Yeah, that's what Kim
keeps telling me.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.774
So, when do you plan
on telling her?

10:06.807 --> 10:08.976
Today. We're having lunch.

10:10.077 --> 10:12.079
- Daddy!
- Hi!

10:20.187 --> 10:23.390
- [up-tempo music plays]
- [indistinct chattering]

10:23.423 --> 10:26.126
Thank you so much for lending us
your car, Mr. Keeler.

10:26.159 --> 10:30.664
You know, I had my heart set
on giving my dad a pair
of cuff links at dinner tonight,

10:30.698 --> 10:33.200
and I haven't been able
to find anything locally.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.669
But I promise I'll make it back
in time for a late lunch.

10:35.703 --> 10:38.806
Good, because we have
a lot to talk about.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.108
[people shouting, laughing]

10:45.078 --> 10:47.214
Anyways, we gotta go, Pay.
Come on.

10:47.247 --> 10:50.784
- Thank you.
- I'll meet you
at the dorms at 1:45.

10:50.818 --> 10:51.952
Be careful.

10:51.985 --> 10:56.256
* I wanna tell you there's
so much I still do not know *

11:09.169 --> 11:10.403
[panting]

11:10.437 --> 11:13.741
This stupid, old-school routine
requires so many dance elements.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.042
I'm a power tumbler.

11:15.075 --> 11:17.711
I don't even understand
what the point of making me
do this is.

11:17.745 --> 11:19.880
Getting outside
your comfort zone
makes you a better gymnast.

11:21.815 --> 11:25.853
Jordan, why'd you tell me
your foster parents were coming
in this weekend?

11:25.886 --> 11:27.921
I checked the list.

11:27.955 --> 11:30.123
You didn't reserve any seats
for the exhibition.

11:31.158 --> 11:32.926
I never said they were coming.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.262
I only said I invited them.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.864
What difference does it make?

11:36.897 --> 11:37.965
It makes a big difference

11:37.998 --> 11:39.733
'cause now I know
you're free tonight.

11:39.767 --> 11:41.268
You're coming
to my house for dinner.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.103
KP's mother's cooking.

11:43.136 --> 11:45.773
[scoffs] I don't need you
feeling sorry for me.

11:45.806 --> 11:49.943
I don't. I was hoping
you'd feel sorry for me. Look...

11:49.977 --> 11:53.146
...Annie's out of town,
and I'm not sure I can
handle Sheila on my own.

11:53.180 --> 11:57.184
Well, maybe you need to get
outside your comfort zone.

11:57.217 --> 12:00.253
I have physical therapy
scheduled for tonight, so...

12:06.559 --> 12:10.764
I've, uh, had
a few dizzy spells,
passed out a couple of times.

12:10.798 --> 12:13.200
- Other than that, I'm great.
- She blacked out
while she was...

12:13.233 --> 12:17.237
Running across campus! I was
late for my history class, so...

12:18.872 --> 12:19.973
And your relation to Rachel?

12:22.943 --> 12:25.879
Oh! I'm her... partner.

12:26.947 --> 12:29.049
Oh. No judgments here.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.151
No, no, no!
We're not...

12:32.552 --> 12:36.223
We... Sure, never mind,
whatever.

12:38.291 --> 12:42.562
Do you ever notice any symptoms
before you get dizzy or faint?

12:42.595 --> 12:46.166
Just this funny numbness
in my fingers.

12:50.237 --> 12:52.772
Let's run some tests, Rachel.
Get to the bottom of this.

13:00.914 --> 13:03.851
[monitor beeping]

13:29.376 --> 13:32.345
Hey, I am so sorry, Dad.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.314
I'm not gonna be able
to make it.

13:34.347 --> 13:37.217
Are you sure you need to cancel?
Because I can wait.

13:37.250 --> 13:40.988
Lauren's still looking
for the perfect cuff links.

13:41.021 --> 13:43.090
And then we're gonna have to run
straight from here to rehearsal.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.192
Well, we're still on
for dinner, right?

13:45.225 --> 13:47.861
Oh, absolutely!
I'm making you your favorite.

13:47.895 --> 13:49.062
We'll have plenty of time
to hang out and talk.

13:49.096 --> 13:52.099
- Good. I'll see you later then.
- OK. Love you, Dad.

14:01.641 --> 14:02.910
[sobbing]

14:32.139 --> 14:36.176
So, Dr. Curtis says all I need
are some potassium supplements,
and I'm be good to go.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.011
Really? That's it?

14:38.045 --> 14:40.280
What a relief, huh?
Come on. We gotta go.

14:40.313 --> 14:43.150
We've got just enough time
to make it back for practice.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.384
[up-tempo music plays]

14:56.496 --> 14:58.932
So, what're you making
for your dad?

14:58.966 --> 15:01.969
- Chicken Parm.
- Oh, his fave. He'll love it.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.340
Come on, Payson.

15:07.374 --> 15:10.510
You've forgiven Lauren.
Why won't you forgive me?

15:14.047 --> 15:18.118
You were my best friend, Kaylie.
I expected more from you.

15:18.151 --> 15:24.091
- Can we please just go back
to the way things were?
- So much has changed.

15:24.124 --> 15:26.126
Too much?

15:29.296 --> 15:31.999
- [KP] Hey!
- Better go get those groceries.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.037
When are your parents
getting you?

15:37.070 --> 15:38.972
They're not. Austin is.

15:40.407 --> 15:42.142
Austin's coming
to dinner with you?

15:42.175 --> 15:44.111
Yeah.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.346
Has Austin ever had dinner
with your parents before?

15:46.379 --> 15:48.381
[chuckles] No. Why?

15:48.415 --> 15:52.085
Because, the first time
your boyfriend has dinner
with your parents

15:52.119 --> 15:55.122
- is like a mondo major deal!
- No, not in my world.

15:55.155 --> 15:59.059
[scoffs] Hello?
It's like the next big step
in any serious relationship!

15:59.092 --> 16:01.094
- I don't see it that way.
- I bet Austin does.

16:01.128 --> 16:04.131
- You'd lose that bet.
- [knocking at door]

16:04.164 --> 16:05.298
Coming!

16:11.038 --> 16:12.205
I hope your mom likes roses.

16:14.241 --> 16:15.575
[exhales sharply]

16:22.215 --> 16:25.152
That's done. Put that there.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.020
There. OK.

16:27.054 --> 16:29.556
I thought you told the coach
you were making him
a home cooked meal?

16:29.589 --> 16:32.225
Please, I want to impress him.
I don't want to poison him.

16:32.259 --> 16:34.027
All right, do me a favor.
Take these empty containers.

16:34.061 --> 16:35.562
Shove them, honey,
at the very bottom
of the garbage.

16:35.595 --> 16:39.166
All the way. Shove them all
in there, all right?

16:39.199 --> 16:42.069
This is gonna be great. Come on.
What's the matter? Smile.

16:42.102 --> 16:45.272
This is a good night. I intend
to have your position
as team leader

16:45.305 --> 16:50.410
sewn up before I serve
my homemade sweet potato pie.

16:50.443 --> 16:53.313
- Why are you doing this?
- Why am I doing this?

16:53.346 --> 16:55.782
Because the team captain
gets the most interviews,

16:55.815 --> 16:57.450
which makes her
the most famous,

16:57.484 --> 17:01.221
which lands her
the most lucrative endorsements.

17:01.254 --> 17:03.456
- Can't you just be
my mother tonight?
- Your mother...

17:03.490 --> 17:06.159
That's cra... What kind
of mother would I be

17:06.193 --> 17:10.063
if I didn't try to ensure
my own beautiful, talented
daughter's future?

17:10.097 --> 17:12.599
I'm doing this for you.
Now, check my teeth.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.367
- You're good.
- OK, good.

17:14.401 --> 17:15.568
- [door opens]
- Coach McIntire!

17:15.602 --> 17:20.407
Ooh! Hello, Coach Mac, welcome.
You're just in time, huh?

17:20.440 --> 17:22.109
Dinner is served.

17:22.142 --> 17:25.378
I hope you like you
some soul food.

17:25.412 --> 17:28.448
I do as long as you
have enough for four.

17:32.852 --> 17:35.655
Look, Jordan, soul food.

17:42.229 --> 17:43.896
[low-tempo music plays]

17:43.930 --> 17:47.267
You should have cleared it
with me before you agreed
to let Kaylie drag along Austin.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.369
Why do keep
repeating yourself?

17:49.402 --> 17:51.371
Are you in love with the sound
of your own voice?

17:51.404 --> 17:53.606
Only if it drowns out yours.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.508
- [Kaylie] Hi.
- Oh, hi!

17:55.542 --> 17:58.478
- [Alex] Hi, sweetie.
- Oh, thank you.
They're beautiful.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.480
Hi.

18:00.513 --> 18:03.516
- Alex, would you put those...
- Sure.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.485
So, how was the drive down?

18:05.518 --> 18:07.454
- Oh, lovely.
- We took separate cars.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.457
Well, I am starved.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.425
They don't feed us here.
My BMI is so low.

18:12.459 --> 18:15.462
Lemonades for the kids,
a couple of vodka tonics for us.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.664
No, I order
my own drinks now, Alex.

18:17.697 --> 18:20.533
I'll have a martini, please.
Thank you.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.503
[clears throat]

18:30.643 --> 18:33.313
There's something I want to get
straight right off the bat.

18:37.384 --> 18:39.519
Did you really promise
to hit a homer for that kid
in the hospital

18:39.552 --> 18:42.222
before game seven
against Texas?

18:43.323 --> 18:45.492
Yeah, I did.

18:45.525 --> 18:47.527
That may be the coolest
baseball story I've ever heard.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.630
What a shot! Over 400 feet
and right out of the park.

18:50.663 --> 18:53.433
You practically hit it
all the way back
to the kid's hospital room.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.636
That's exactly what I was
thinking when I stepped up
to the plate.

18:56.669 --> 19:00.707
- No way.
- I just pictured that sweet kid
lying in his hospital bed

19:00.740 --> 19:04.411
and thought, "I'm sending
this one back to you, pal."

19:04.444 --> 19:06.713
And Williams hurls
that smokin' fastball.

19:06.746 --> 19:09.516
I was in a zone.
It's like I knew right
where he was going to put it

19:09.549 --> 19:12.585
- and boom...
- Goes the dynamite!

19:14.321 --> 19:15.522
How did you know
about that story?

19:15.555 --> 19:20.293
YouTube. They have
a whole series
of your greatest hits.

19:20.327 --> 19:21.561
I've seen them all.

19:23.530 --> 19:24.264
Wow.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.501
And you're gonna love this.

19:28.535 --> 19:32.272
All of the kids,
they just followed her
right to the sandbox.

19:32.305 --> 19:36.509
I mean, since daycare,
she has had true
leadership ability. Really.

19:36.543 --> 19:39.746
Grace under fire under the most
challenging of conditions.

19:39.779 --> 19:43.350
What did that one teacher
call you? You know, the teacher
with the curly, red hair.

19:43.383 --> 19:47.754
Oh! She said she was...
She says, "Kelly is
the queen of the Play-Doh."

19:47.787 --> 19:51.324
[laughing] Just...
Like at eight years old.

19:51.358 --> 19:53.393
She's just a leader,
you know what I'm say...

19:53.426 --> 19:57.330
But in the gym, well... The gym
is where she really shines.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.566
Kelly's a terrific gymnast.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.568
[scoffs] Hear, hear to that!

20:03.636 --> 20:05.672
Right, baby? Mm! Mm!

20:06.673 --> 20:07.707
Uh, oh, coach,

20:07.740 --> 20:09.376
I wish you
could've been there,

20:09.409 --> 20:12.612
2008, when Kelly
brought home Junior Worlds.

20:12.645 --> 20:16.015
It was one of the first
of many, many shining moments

20:16.048 --> 20:18.985
- for my little star.
- That wasn't me.

20:19.018 --> 20:21.721
- Yes, it was. Honey, it was.
- No, it was not. It was not.

20:21.754 --> 20:24.657
- Well, if it wasn't you,
then who was it?
- [Jordan clears throat]

20:24.691 --> 20:26.693
That would be my shining moment.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.828
[McIntire clears throat]

20:31.331 --> 20:33.032
You're right.

20:33.065 --> 20:36.469
- And it is so sad how you've
struggled ever since.
- [Kelly] Mom.

20:37.837 --> 20:40.673
- I don't see her
struggling in my gym.
- [Sheila] No?

20:40.707 --> 20:43.676
[McIntire] All I see
is courage and maturity.

20:43.710 --> 20:47.447
In fact, Jordan has
all the qualities
of a natural born leader.

20:52.419 --> 20:53.453
You know, I don't think

20:53.486 --> 20:56.356
there's ever been
another gymnastics golden couple

20:56.389 --> 20:57.724
going into the Olympics.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.526
[Alex] I'd like to jump
on this right away.

20:59.559 --> 21:03.463
- Set up some interviews
for you two next week.
- We'd love that.

21:03.496 --> 21:06.299
It's been a great evening,
but I have a really early...

21:06.333 --> 21:08.568
And you should start thinking
about your career post-Olympics.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.670
My sports marketing business
could always use a partner.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.805
[Ronnie] You and Alex
would make a great team.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.707
I always thought that might be
something I'd be good at.

21:14.741 --> 21:17.677
We should talk more
about this some other time.

21:17.710 --> 21:20.713
You're right.
How about we all meet up
after your exhibition tomorrow?

21:20.747 --> 21:24.684
- Tomorrow?!
- Sounds good to me, Mr. Cruz.

21:24.717 --> 21:25.818
Call me Alex, son.

21:30.690 --> 21:33.593
The whole experience here
has been fantastic.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.328
I've met
so many great people.

21:35.362 --> 21:36.829
It's like a whole new world
has opened up for me.

21:36.863 --> 21:40.467
- I can see that.
- I just wish that you got
to meet Rigo this weekend.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.869
As soon as training ends,
he'll be in Boulder to visit me.

21:42.902 --> 21:45.338
- And then everybody...
- Payson?

21:47.139 --> 21:48.641
We need to talk.

21:50.410 --> 21:52.379
I wondered why you were
so quiet through dinner.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.748
You're mad at me for missing
our lunch, aren't you?

21:55.782 --> 21:59.552
Not at all. It was
actually kind of a...

22:00.687 --> 22:02.722
...a life lesson for me.

22:02.755 --> 22:03.890
What do you mean?

22:03.923 --> 22:06.693
Well, I realized, you know,
how independent you've become.

22:09.462 --> 22:11.764
You're not
my little girl anymore.

22:11.798 --> 22:14.667
Soon you'll be going
to the Olympics, then college.

22:14.701 --> 22:17.504
Mom's already given me the birds
and the bees talk, Dad.

22:17.537 --> 22:19.839
- No, that's not
what this is about.
- Whew.

22:21.774 --> 22:24.644
It's time for the family
to make another big decision,

22:24.677 --> 22:28.114
like we did when we moved
to Boulder for your training.

22:28.147 --> 22:31.718
But this time we have
to consider what's best
for the family as a whole.

22:33.185 --> 22:38.558
And we're thinking... we should
move back to Minnesota.

22:39.826 --> 22:41.728
What? Why?

22:41.761 --> 22:43.430
I have
a great job opportunity there,

22:43.463 --> 22:45.665
and someone's actually
interested in buying the house.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.734
What about Becca?
Does she wanna move?

22:47.767 --> 22:50.670
Your sister knows
that she's probably
not gonna go on as an elite,

22:50.703 --> 22:52.905
and she misses
her friends back home.

22:52.939 --> 22:56.909
But The Rock. I'll need
to train before the Olympics!

22:56.943 --> 22:59.712
Here's the good part.
I already talked to Ronnie.

22:59.746 --> 23:01.548
And until you go to London,

23:01.581 --> 23:05.418
you can stay
with your best friend.
Stay at Kaylie's house.

23:24.737 --> 23:28.541
- Why did you do
all that at dinner?
- Do what?

23:28.575 --> 23:31.478
[scoffs] I just wanted it
to be a low key night.

23:31.511 --> 23:33.646
Instead it turned
into this huge thing

23:33.680 --> 23:36.616
that spun out of control
like everything else in my life!

23:36.649 --> 23:38.751
I was just making sure
everybody got along.

23:38.785 --> 23:40.520
Isn't that
what I was there for?

23:40.553 --> 23:41.988
You showed up wearing a suit!

23:42.021 --> 23:44.624
It wasn't supposed to be
a suit kind of dinner.

23:44.657 --> 23:46.893
What's next? You and my dad
are gonna plan our wedding?

23:46.926 --> 23:50.530
Calm down. OK, I hear
what you're saying,

23:50.563 --> 23:53.700
and I didn't mean
for dinner to devolve
into a merger meeting.

23:53.733 --> 23:56.736
Really? Because everything
my dad said, you just went
along with.

23:56.769 --> 24:00.607
- No one even stopped
to ask me what I thought.
- We didn't?

24:02.642 --> 24:04.877
Look, I'm just going to tell
my parents to forget

24:04.911 --> 24:08.014
about this whole
golden couple thing, OK?

24:08.047 --> 24:10.583
I just... I need to remain
focused on why I'm here.

24:10.617 --> 24:13.620
I know. You're right. I was
probably trying too hard.

24:13.653 --> 24:16.255
It's just I know
how much your parents love you,

24:16.288 --> 24:18.525
and I really want them
to like me.

24:22.929 --> 24:24.664
Because I love you.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.913
I misjudged Austin.

24:40.947 --> 24:44.817
That's because you think
nobody's good enough
for your little girl.

24:46.719 --> 24:49.622
- You see the way
he took her hand?
- Uh-huh.

24:49.656 --> 24:51.558
He loves her.

24:52.692 --> 24:55.061
You remember
when we were like that?

24:55.094 --> 24:56.963
I remember.

24:57.964 --> 25:00.733
Well, thanks
for walking me.

25:00.767 --> 25:02.835
My pleasure.

25:11.711 --> 25:14.981
What...
What are we doing?

25:15.014 --> 25:16.949
I know, right?

25:18.951 --> 25:20.887
It's not like we're
a couple of teenagers.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.522
I'll say.

25:25.357 --> 25:28.695
- He said he loved you?
- Mm-hm.

25:28.728 --> 25:31.831
- How romantic!
- Well, not really.

25:33.700 --> 25:34.734
I didn't say it back.

25:34.767 --> 25:37.837
What? Why not? You do love him,
though, don't you?

25:37.870 --> 25:40.773
Yeah... I... I think I do,

25:40.807 --> 25:42.975
I just...
I couldn't say it.

25:43.009 --> 25:44.677
Why not?

25:44.711 --> 25:48.014
I don't know. Everything's
just changing so fast,

25:48.047 --> 25:49.849
and I can't even
think straight and...

25:50.750 --> 25:52.585
London has to be
my number one priority.

25:52.619 --> 25:55.755
I can not let anybody stop me
from getting to the Olympics.

25:55.788 --> 25:57.990
And I am not ready
to get married.

25:58.024 --> 26:01.994
Um, whoa there, Princess Bride.
Austin just said he loved you.

26:02.028 --> 26:03.830
He didn't propose marriage.

26:03.863 --> 26:05.698
They're completely
different things.

26:05.732 --> 26:06.966
It doesn't feel that way.

26:06.999 --> 26:10.737
Well, OK, when you
told Carter you loved him,

26:10.770 --> 26:12.772
did you think it meant you
two were headed down the aisle?

26:16.676 --> 26:19.879
I... I never told
Carter I loved him.

26:19.912 --> 26:22.649
Well, have you ever
said it to anyone?

26:28.955 --> 26:31.157
- [humming]
- [door closes]

26:31.190 --> 26:35.061
I got the girls to their dorms,
and I should be getting
to bed myself.

26:35.094 --> 26:36.863
- Thanks for dinner, Sheila.
- Oh, you're welcome.

26:36.896 --> 26:38.798
Hey, um, do you have a sec?

26:38.831 --> 26:41.768
- Uh...
- Come on. Try my pie.

26:41.801 --> 26:45.738
[sighs] Sure.

26:45.772 --> 26:48.374
It's embarrassing,
but I'd kick myself

26:48.407 --> 26:51.177
if I didn't confess I...
All through dinner,

26:51.210 --> 26:54.781
I kept thinking to myself,
"That Coach McIntire...

26:54.814 --> 26:57.049
I mean, not only talented,
but, I mean,

26:57.083 --> 27:00.720
one really handsome
hunk of man."

27:00.753 --> 27:03.956
- Listen, Sheila, I'm not...
- You have a gorgeous face,

27:03.990 --> 27:08.127
and this is a face
a camera would love.

27:10.897 --> 27:14.867
Oh, well... thank you.

27:14.901 --> 27:16.736
You're welcome.

27:16.769 --> 27:19.005
I mean, I know coaches
don't make a lot of dough

27:19.038 --> 27:22.775
and careers are fleeting
and money is tight
for everybody.

27:22.809 --> 27:25.878
But I could change
all of that for you
with the snap of my fingers.

27:25.912 --> 27:27.814
I have such connections.

27:27.847 --> 27:30.817
I could hook you up with
a very lucrative sponsorship.

27:30.850 --> 27:34.020
- Really?
- Mm-hm. Yeah.

27:34.053 --> 27:37.790
- I guess I hadn't given
that idea much thought.
- Oh, I have.

27:37.824 --> 27:38.925
I mean, this is a big deal.

27:38.958 --> 27:41.060
A deal that could make
all your money problems go away.

27:41.093 --> 27:42.829
What do you mean?

27:42.862 --> 27:44.931
Oh, well...

27:44.964 --> 27:49.936
I mean, I know you
lost your nest egg
in the financial crisis.

27:49.969 --> 27:54.140
And, I mean,
your Texas house is being
mortgaged to the rafters.

27:54.173 --> 27:57.243
- I know that it's a struggle.
- Ah, we'll get by.

27:57.276 --> 28:02.081
Yeah, but doesn't
your wife deserve more
than just getting by?

28:02.114 --> 28:03.916
I mean, coach,
I'd like to help.

28:03.950 --> 28:06.853
And all you have
to do is confirm

28:06.886 --> 28:09.221
that my Kelly is
going to the Olympics
as the team captain.

28:09.255 --> 28:11.057
It's simple quid pro quo.

28:11.090 --> 28:12.759
There's nothing simple
about that.

28:12.792 --> 28:13.760
Shh. You know what?

28:13.793 --> 28:15.027
I don't want you
to answer now.

28:15.061 --> 28:17.797
OK? I want you to think
about it, all right?

28:18.931 --> 28:20.933
Sweet dreams, handsome.

28:34.180 --> 28:38.017
- What's going on?
- Oh!

28:38.050 --> 28:40.887
Have you...
seen my retainer?

28:40.920 --> 28:43.923
You mean the one that's
right there on the nightstand?

28:45.925 --> 28:47.760
I must be blind.

28:48.928 --> 28:51.163
I've never seen you pray before.

28:51.197 --> 28:53.065
I wasn't praying.

28:53.099 --> 28:57.236
But you should.
Living with Kaylie
is gonna be way awkward.

28:57.269 --> 29:00.873
I can't believe that my parents
decided to move without even
discussing it with me.

29:00.907 --> 29:02.909
Haven't they put
you first long enough?

29:02.942 --> 29:08.514
Maybe it's time they...
do what's best for them
for a change.

29:08.547 --> 29:11.884
I never thought I'd hear
something like that coming out
of Lauren Tanner's mouth.

29:13.052 --> 29:15.121
Maybe I'm
finally growing up.

29:15.154 --> 29:17.790
Or maybe there's something else
going on with you?

29:18.357 --> 29:19.892
[sighs]

29:19.926 --> 29:21.828
I'm gonna go pick up
a few things at the store.

29:21.861 --> 29:23.796
I'll meet you at the gym.

29:42.181 --> 29:43.883
Hi, Dr. Curtis?

29:45.251 --> 29:46.953
It's Rachel Martin.

29:46.986 --> 29:48.921
I'm sorry to bother you
on your cell,

29:48.955 --> 29:52.058
but... I was wondering
if there's any way

29:52.091 --> 29:56.095
I could get you to explain
what's wrong with me
just one more time?

29:57.129 --> 30:00.399
Last night was... amazing.

30:01.868 --> 30:05.037
But it can't happen again.

30:05.071 --> 30:07.106
I was thinking the same thing.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.276
I was also thinking that...

30:10.309 --> 30:12.912
...I'd really like us to try
to be better friends

30:12.945 --> 30:15.114
than we were
when we were married.

30:15.147 --> 30:18.250
I'd like that.
And so would Kaylie.

30:18.284 --> 30:21.320
- [knocking at door]
- Are you expecting someone?

30:21.353 --> 30:23.089
Room service.

30:23.122 --> 30:26.392
No reason a couple of friends
can't have breakfast in bed.

30:26.425 --> 30:30.062
- You order me eggs Benedict?
- Yeah, right,
with your cholesterol?

30:50.049 --> 30:52.018
So, does this mean you guys
are getting back together?

30:52.051 --> 30:53.986
No, we're not.

30:54.020 --> 30:57.223
Last night happened because...

30:57.256 --> 31:00.359
I don't know. We were happy
to see you and Austin together.

31:01.393 --> 31:03.429
It brought back good memories.

31:03.462 --> 31:07.066
I mean, we do still care
about each other.

31:07.099 --> 31:08.367
The drinks didn't hurt.

31:10.002 --> 31:11.670
Are you happy it happened?

31:11.703 --> 31:15.041
I am. Much to our surprise,

31:15.074 --> 31:17.076
it helped get us
to a better place.

31:17.109 --> 31:20.079
OK, then why aren't you
back together?

31:21.313 --> 31:23.482
Because we're just
not in love anymore.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.920
I so don't understand
this whole love thing.

31:27.954 --> 31:32.458
Well, your father and I
haven't exactly been
the best example of it.

31:32.491 --> 31:36.395
It's just not like anything
I thought it would be.

31:38.130 --> 31:43.135
When I was little,
I thought I'd grow up...

31:45.271 --> 31:48.207
...fall in love
and get married...

31:48.240 --> 31:50.409
...and everything
would be perfect.

31:52.044 --> 31:53.445
Honey...

31:53.479 --> 31:58.951
...I know you strive
for perfection every day
in the gym,

31:58.985 --> 32:01.520
but most things in life
aren't perfect...

32:02.488 --> 32:04.490
...especially love.

32:05.724 --> 32:08.260
Sometimes you just gotta...

32:08.294 --> 32:11.964
...have a leap of faith
and hope it all works out.

32:11.998 --> 32:14.400
Maybe that's
what scares me.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.368
It scares all of us.

32:16.402 --> 32:20.973
Love can be messy
and confusing, unpredictable.

32:22.008 --> 32:23.409
But love is life.

32:25.177 --> 32:27.079
And if you miss out on love,

32:27.113 --> 32:30.016
you missed out on
the best part of living.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.422
I love you, Mom.

32:36.455 --> 32:40.026
Oh, honey,
I love you, too.

32:43.362 --> 32:44.563
[up-tempo music plays]

32:49.135 --> 32:51.503
Well, right now Payson's
not even speaking to me.

32:51.537 --> 32:53.405
I don't know, Kim.

32:53.439 --> 32:57.443
I'm not sure now if we should
make the move.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.546
Not if it's gonna
upset Payson like this.

33:01.380 --> 33:03.315
Mm-hm. OK.

33:04.450 --> 33:05.984
Love you.

33:11.457 --> 33:13.792
- Hey, guys.
- Hi. How you doing?

33:13.825 --> 33:16.362
- You excited?
- [sighs]

33:19.598 --> 33:22.034
- You looking forward to this?
- [scoffs]

33:22.068 --> 33:24.436
To be honest, I can't wait
to be done with it.

33:24.470 --> 33:27.573
I'm ready to get back
to 21st century gymnastics.

33:27.606 --> 33:30.409
You may think your routine
is obsolete, but it's
a part of your history.

33:30.442 --> 33:32.444
- Mm.
- You have to know
where you've been

33:32.478 --> 33:34.180
in order to know
where you're going.

33:34.213 --> 33:36.448
Excuse me. Excuse me,
coming through here.

33:36.482 --> 33:38.450
I don't... Sorry. Ow.

33:38.484 --> 33:41.587
Hey, put your coats to the side.
Thank you so much.

33:41.620 --> 33:45.091
Oh, God.
Is there a snack bar?

33:46.358 --> 33:48.494
I don't know how you put up
with that woman last night.

33:48.527 --> 33:51.063
Well, it was
for Kelly's sake.

33:51.097 --> 33:52.631
Sheila's all she has.

33:53.632 --> 33:56.068
We all need a support.

33:57.569 --> 33:59.305
Since you don't have
anybody up there,

33:59.338 --> 34:01.373
why don't you consider me
your support today?

34:04.476 --> 34:07.579
- OK.
- But tomorrow I go right back
to being your hard-ass coach.

34:07.613 --> 34:10.316
- [laughs] OK.
- All right.

34:15.254 --> 34:18.557
- Sorry I'm late. That wrestler
cornered me again.
- Lauren, stop it.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.826
I talked to Dr. Curtis.

34:20.859 --> 34:22.528
She told me you have
an irregular heartbeat.

34:24.530 --> 34:26.565
Just like a lot of other
perfectly healthy people

34:26.598 --> 34:28.500
who are walking around,
going on with their lives.

34:28.534 --> 34:31.537
You don't even know
what you have! The doctor
said only a cardiologist

34:31.570 --> 34:34.506
will be able to make a diagnosis
and tell you how serious it is.

34:34.540 --> 34:37.443
- Let's talk about this
after the exhibition.
- I can't let you go out there.

34:37.476 --> 34:40.246
What if you black out again
in mid-air over the beam?

34:40.279 --> 34:44.116
How could I live with myself
if you came crashing down
on your stupid little head?

34:44.150 --> 34:45.351
I haven't had a dizzy spell
in over a week.

34:45.384 --> 34:48.120
But there's
an audience out there
which means added stress!

34:48.154 --> 34:51.157
Dr. Curtis said
increased stress can
mess with your heart!

34:51.190 --> 34:53.259
I know you're doing this
because you care,

34:53.292 --> 34:55.427
but I have given up
everything to get here.

34:55.461 --> 34:58.530
I'm not about to let
something that might not
even happen stop me now.

34:58.564 --> 35:01.533
My life, my call.
Not yours!

35:01.567 --> 35:03.202
[McIntire] Places everyone!

35:13.379 --> 35:15.447
[low-tempo music plays]

35:23.422 --> 35:27.593
At the '72 Olympics, Olga Korbut
not only took home the gold,

35:27.626 --> 35:29.628
she did more
to ease Cold War tensions

35:29.661 --> 35:33.332
than all the politicians
and diplomats put together.

35:44.310 --> 35:47.446
Olga's acrobatics
and open display of emotion

35:47.479 --> 35:50.516
in this very routine
captivated the world.

36:08.634 --> 36:10.402
- [applause]
- [exhales]

36:19.445 --> 36:21.547
See? I'm fine.

36:23.482 --> 36:24.716
This time.

36:27.519 --> 36:29.755
[McIntire] Mary Lou Retton
almost missed her chance
for glory

36:29.788 --> 36:32.358
due to a knee injury
that required surgery

36:32.391 --> 36:35.594
just six weeks prior
to the '84 Olympics.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.697
She recovered
just in time to compete

36:38.730 --> 36:41.367
and became the first
American woman ever

36:41.400 --> 36:43.502
to win gold in gymnastics.

36:48.340 --> 36:49.408
Whoo!

36:50.576 --> 36:51.510
[cheers, whistles]

36:51.543 --> 36:53.712
That was perfect.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.652
[Mac] In a sport where
shorter girls dominate,

37:00.686 --> 37:04.523
Svetlana Khorkina was told
she was too tall
for artistic gymnastics.

37:04.556 --> 37:08.594
She proved the naysayers wrong,
taking home the gold

37:08.627 --> 37:11.229
in the Atlanta
and Sydney Olympics.

37:29.515 --> 37:35.020
Nadia Comaneci worked hard
under an extremely grueling
Romanian training program.

37:35.053 --> 37:39.625
She had to leave her family
and train in a strange city
where she knew no one.

37:39.658 --> 37:44.696
But soon the entire world would
know who this 14-year-old was.

37:44.730 --> 37:50.602
At the '76 Olympics, she became
the first gymnast in history
to score a perfect ten.

38:17.663 --> 38:20.499
[applause]

38:21.767 --> 38:23.502
Whoo!

38:27.573 --> 38:29.741
And like those gymnasts
who came before them,

38:29.775 --> 38:35.481
these girls have the potential
to make their own history
at the 2012 London Olympics.

38:35.514 --> 38:37.449
[cheering]

38:37.483 --> 38:38.817
Whoo!

38:44.623 --> 38:48.560
We are grateful
for the opportunity
to honor the amazing gymnasts

38:48.594 --> 38:52.898
who paved the way for us,
but nobody has worked harder

38:52.931 --> 38:57.503
or sacrificed more to help us
realize our dreams than you...

38:57.536 --> 38:59.471
...our parents.

38:59.505 --> 39:01.540
You've made
all of this possible.

39:01.573 --> 39:03.809
And for that,
we honor you.

39:13.419 --> 39:15.654
Coach, coach, coach!

39:15.687 --> 39:18.790
Coach, coach, coach, coach!

39:18.824 --> 39:22.794
Coach, coach, coach,
coach! Whoo!

39:29.801 --> 39:30.636
[Mark] You were terrific
out there.

39:30.669 --> 39:32.671
[Payson] Everyone was
just amazing.

39:32.704 --> 39:35.707
[Kaylie] Thank you.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.611
[pop ballad plays]

39:41.780 --> 39:42.714
Um, I'll be right back.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.719
* Open up your heart

39:47.753 --> 39:49.721
Hi.

39:49.755 --> 39:51.990
Your call,
you sounded funny.

39:53.692 --> 39:55.761
What's going on?

39:55.794 --> 39:59.665
There's something
I should have told you
last night. [clears throat]

40:01.700 --> 40:05.804
* Loneliness
will have its way *

40:05.837 --> 40:06.838
I love you.

40:13.011 --> 40:15.681
I love you,
I love you, I love you!

40:17.883 --> 40:21.687
* I'm chasing out the lies
Chasing out the lies *

40:21.720 --> 40:24.523
- Mom!
- Baby!

40:24.556 --> 40:26.458
You were the best one.
You're always the best one.

40:26.492 --> 40:28.494
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

40:28.527 --> 40:30.462
So, do you want to meet
some of the other girls?

40:30.496 --> 40:32.531
Oh, honey, that would be
a waste of time.

40:32.564 --> 40:35.767
Oh, OK, well, why don't we
just, um, go get some lunch?

40:35.801 --> 40:37.469
There's a Tex-Mex place
I know you'll love.

40:37.503 --> 40:39.538
I'm sorry, honey,
no can do.

40:39.571 --> 40:41.640
Coach McIntire asked me
to meet him about business,

40:41.673 --> 40:44.543
and then I should really
get on the road back home.
It's getting late.

40:46.044 --> 40:48.980
- Whatever.
- Kelly, come on.
Don't be like that.

40:49.014 --> 40:52.250
Come on, you have me all
to yourself for at least
a few minutes.

40:52.283 --> 40:53.752
Come on. Let's do something fun.

40:53.785 --> 40:58.857
* You know I'm broken, too

40:58.890 --> 41:01.627
You know what? It's fine.
I should really be

41:01.660 --> 41:03.629
with the other girls who don't
have mothers here either.

41:03.662 --> 41:05.597
Kelly. Kell...

41:05.631 --> 41:07.733
- Hey.
- Hey. You OK?

41:07.766 --> 41:08.634
Yeah.

41:09.735 --> 41:12.037
- Sheila?
- Oh, hey, handsome.

41:12.070 --> 41:13.572
Let's go somewhere quiet,

41:13.605 --> 41:15.774
and we'll iron out
the details of your arrangement.

41:15.807 --> 41:19.778
- Ah, that's OK.
This'll just take a minute.
- OK.

41:19.811 --> 41:23.815
Here's the deal:
Nobody'll ever buy a place
onto my Olympic Team.

41:23.849 --> 41:27.786
[scoffs] I wasn't
trying to buy anything!

41:27.819 --> 41:30.789
I was simply offering you a deal
that would benefit you.

41:30.822 --> 41:33.925
Your proposition could have
destroyed Kelly's dream.

41:33.959 --> 41:37.796
Most coaches would have
sent her packing the minute
you tried to bribe them.

41:37.829 --> 41:40.666
- But I'm not going to do that.
- Time to get off
your high horse, McIntire.

41:40.699 --> 41:43.702
You're not fooling anyone here.
You're not sending Kelly home

41:43.735 --> 41:47.305
- because she is a star
and you need her.
- Listen, lady,

41:47.338 --> 41:50.809
every one of these girls
is a star.

41:50.842 --> 41:55.080
I'm keeping Kelly
'cause it wouldn't be fair
to penalize her because of you.

41:55.113 --> 42:00.285
I think she's suffered enough...
having you for a mother.

42:00.318 --> 42:03.054
Mm. Thanks for
the parenting advice, Montel.

42:04.956 --> 42:07.659
But you did get
one thing right:

42:07.693 --> 42:10.596
I do have a face
that the camera would love.

42:11.863 --> 42:16.802
* You know I'm broken, too

42:16.835 --> 42:18.737
Hi.

42:18.770 --> 42:21.840
* I've fallen far
I lost my faith *

42:23.809 --> 42:26.812
I've been thinking
about what you said last night.

42:28.914 --> 42:30.115
And you're right.

42:30.148 --> 42:32.618
My time at The Rock
is almost over,

42:32.651 --> 42:33.919
and my life's
going to change.

42:36.021 --> 42:38.924
You should move back home
to Minnesota and take that job.

42:41.893 --> 42:43.895
You really are growing up,
aren't you?

42:44.896 --> 42:46.732
I guess I am.

42:46.765 --> 42:48.734
* Waiting for the light
to change *

42:48.767 --> 42:50.135
One thing.

42:50.168 --> 42:53.004
While I'm training
at The Rock,

42:53.038 --> 42:54.873
I would really
rather stay with Lauren.

42:56.875 --> 42:58.677
Lauren?

42:58.710 --> 42:59.811
We've gotten really close.

42:59.845 --> 43:03.682
She's my friend,
and she needs me...

43:03.715 --> 43:05.984
...now more than ever.

43:08.119 --> 43:10.856
I couldn't be prouder of
the young woman you've become.

43:13.124 --> 43:17.929
It seemed like yesterday
you were learning to walk to me.

43:19.931 --> 43:22.768
Before long,
you'll be walking away.

43:22.801 --> 43:24.870
Don't think you're getting
rid of me that easy.

43:27.172 --> 43:30.175
Come on. Let's go get
that lunch we missed yesterday.

43:30.208 --> 43:31.977
Hm.

43:33.178 --> 43:36.915
[exhales] You buying?

43:36.948 --> 43:38.850
I'm not that grown up!

43:38.884 --> 43:40.919
[chuckles]
