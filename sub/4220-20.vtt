WEBVTT

00:01.251 --> 00:03.086
Just had a phone call
from a Jack Nesbitt.

00:03.462 --> 00:04.671
Looking for
references for you.

00:04.755 --> 00:06.839
- It's a construction gig.
- They're renovating.

00:06.924 --> 00:07.924
Here's my bid.

00:08.050 --> 00:09.258
I like you, Matt,
I trust you.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.551
You got the job.

00:11.387 --> 00:12.428
You scared me.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.097
I don't remember any of it.
Nothing?

00:16.975 --> 00:17.975
Nothing.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.561
A restaurant?
In North Carolina?

00:20.854 --> 00:23.106
Our grandfather left us
this restaurant in his will.

00:23.607 --> 00:24.899
What if we take a crack
at opening it?

00:30.072 --> 00:32.073
Twenty seconds left.
Don't let up, Wolverines!

00:32.199 --> 00:34.450
Hey, Luke, Luke!
What are you doing
over there?

00:34.618 --> 00:36.869
Come on! Pay attention!
Let's go, skate!

00:37.538 --> 00:39.372
Luke! Get the puck,
get the puck!

00:41.291 --> 00:44.335
No, no! No, the other way!
The other way!

00:45.379 --> 00:46.963
Turn around!
All right, there you go!

00:47.172 --> 00:48.381
That's my boy!

00:50.801 --> 00:52.719
Come on, tripping! Ref!

00:52.886 --> 00:54.053
He tripped over
his own feet.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.306
Whoa!

00:57.391 --> 00:59.142
What a move
for the defense!

01:08.569 --> 01:10.653
We're going to
the championship!

01:11.321 --> 01:12.822
Hey, that was great!

01:14.616 --> 01:16.409
Champions!

01:16.660 --> 01:18.119
Nice win, Wolverines.

01:18.746 --> 01:19.829
See you next week
for the cup.

01:20.330 --> 01:21.414
Just make sure you get
your boys ready for

01:21.498 --> 01:22.623
the trouncing
they're about to get.

01:22.875 --> 01:24.500
Let 'em know
it's okay to cry.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.085
Put your money where
your mouth is?

01:26.170 --> 01:28.171
Whoa! You want to bet
on a kids' hockey game?

01:28.505 --> 01:29.756
Oh, suddenly you're not
so cocky.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.048
C'mon, 500 bucks.

01:31.592 --> 01:32.592
It's on.

01:35.888 --> 01:37.054
Chaplain.

01:37.848 --> 01:39.348
See ya next week, sucker!

01:41.685 --> 01:44.353
There's ten seconds left
on the clock,
when Luke gets the puck,

01:44.521 --> 01:46.481
he's surrounded
on all sides.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.859
And he bobs, and he weaves,
and he gives 'em the slip!

01:50.068 --> 01:51.611
Oh, yeah! Go, Luke.

01:51.862 --> 01:53.446
Yeah. Yeah,
I've never been so proud.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.699
He gets the puck
to the center Milazzo,
who goes in,

01:56.784 --> 01:58.075
scores and wins!

01:58.327 --> 02:01.120
With an assist courtesy
of Luke Herrmann.

02:03.415 --> 02:04.999
An assist?

02:06.043 --> 02:07.960
Hey, morning, Chief!
Morning.

02:08.045 --> 02:09.337
Hey, Chief.
Chief.

02:10.047 --> 02:11.339
Peter Mills.

02:11.882 --> 02:13.382
Are you ready
to work Squad?

02:13.550 --> 02:15.259
Uh, of course.
Medical cleared me. So...

02:15.552 --> 02:17.220
So, gear up, then.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.097
Today?
Yes, today.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.266
With Severide out on medical,

02:22.351 --> 02:24.602
Rice is stepping up
into Acting Lieutenant.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.395
Therefore I have
a spot to fill.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.897
Wow. Uh...

02:28.190 --> 02:30.233
Wait, who's coming
in to ride with Brett?

02:30.442 --> 02:32.485
I have a relief medic.
Are you in or you out?

02:33.403 --> 02:35.571
Oh, I'm in.
I am totally in.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.032
You got your gear, Mills?
Yeah.

03:03.934 --> 03:04.934
Hey, bud.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.103
Matt.
Hey.

03:08.605 --> 03:13.025
Your shirt. That you...
That you lent me to,
you know, wear home.

03:13.110 --> 03:14.277
Um, I washed it.

03:15.112 --> 03:16.320
You didn't have to
do that.

03:16.780 --> 03:17.905
Common courtesy.

03:18.073 --> 03:20.241
We agreed that what happened
wasn't gonna change anything
between us,

03:20.325 --> 03:22.618
that we were
still just friends.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.913
And, if a friend lent me
a shirt, I would wash it.

03:26.623 --> 03:27.707
Fair enough.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.084
No special treatment, right?

03:30.836 --> 03:32.044
Right.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.174
Hey, uh...

03:38.802 --> 03:40.136
Great night, though.

03:41.972 --> 03:43.806
Yeah. It really was.

03:52.816 --> 03:55.526
Hey, uh, what do you guys
know about Erik McAuley?

03:57.404 --> 04:00.072
McAuley, the paramedic,
he's the worst.
Mr. Doom-and-Gloom.

04:00.532 --> 04:01.991
Total bummer. Why?

04:02.492 --> 04:04.744
Since Mills is working Squad,
McAuley is gonna relieve him
on ambo.

04:05.037 --> 04:06.120
Oh, God.

04:06.204 --> 04:07.496
No. No, he's not.

04:08.332 --> 04:10.333
Chief, are you bringing
McAuley in?

04:10.667 --> 04:11.792
Yes, I'm short a medic.

04:12.002 --> 04:14.003
No. No way.
I'll go work on ambo

04:14.087 --> 04:17.506
before McAuley comes back here
and brings the whole house
down with his Eeyore routine.

04:17.674 --> 04:18.841
Okay, good.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.260
Casey, you willing to
give up your candidate
for a few shifts,

04:21.345 --> 04:23.095
till I find myself
somebody permanent?

04:23.347 --> 04:24.347
Wait, what?

04:25.349 --> 04:26.307
Sure.

04:26.391 --> 04:27.600
Thank you, Dawson.

04:30.604 --> 04:31.771
Yay! Great.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.648
Help me with inventory.

04:37.235 --> 04:40.279
Yeah. Okay. Great.

04:42.407 --> 04:43.699
Hey, what's new, Mills?

04:44.534 --> 04:46.744
Well, my mom and Elise
are going down to
North Carolina,

04:46.870 --> 04:48.621
sell my grandfather's
restaurant.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.915
Ought to pay off a couple
credit card bills, y'know.

04:50.999 --> 04:55.419
What else?
Oh, what else?

04:56.046 --> 04:57.046
Oh, yeah.

04:57.464 --> 04:58.547
I'm back on Squad, baby!

05:02.886 --> 05:05.930
Truck 81, Squad 3,
Ambulance 61.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.558
Battalion 25. Person trapped.
Washtenaw and 19th.

05:29.871 --> 05:31.622
What the hell is this?

05:46.513 --> 05:48.556
Rice, get up there,
take his weight off
that bracket.

05:48.640 --> 05:51.100
Casey, give 'em
an overhead anchor point.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.728
Herrmann, Mouch, Otis,
let's get a straight ladder
up to him.

05:53.812 --> 05:55.688
- Cruz, position the aerial.
- Copy that!

06:18.545 --> 06:19.628
Is he even alive?

06:19.796 --> 06:21.505
He's alive.
He's still breathing!

06:21.631 --> 06:23.340
Let's get him down!
I need a saw!

06:23.467 --> 06:24.508
Got it.

06:34.436 --> 06:35.394
Talk to me.

06:35.479 --> 06:36.896
I can't get at the bracket
from this angle.

06:37.272 --> 06:38.981
Mills, I need you to
get it from above.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.484
Give me one second.
Cap, let me grab
the rope bag.

06:44.738 --> 06:45.821
Good to go.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.043
All right, I got him.

07:00.170 --> 07:02.004
Got it?
Yep. All right.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.179
Okay, he's free.

07:10.931 --> 07:11.931
- All right, got it?
- Yep.

07:19.231 --> 07:22.108
- Okay, easy. Easy.
- There you go.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.069
He's got a broken femur.

07:25.403 --> 07:28.906
Looks like a dislocated
shoulder, and multiple
contusions.

07:29.658 --> 07:31.033
This guy's been
through hell.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.538
Banana.
Banana?

07:35.872 --> 07:38.249
Did he just say "banana"?
I think he did.

07:38.834 --> 07:40.042
Okay, let's go.

07:44.089 --> 07:46.757
The surgical wound is
healing pretty well.

07:46.842 --> 07:48.801
I was hoping to get
back on shift today.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.886
We need to keep an eye
on your breathing
for another week or two.

07:51.221 --> 07:53.597
I can breathe fine. No pain.

07:59.229 --> 08:00.437
See?

08:02.399 --> 08:03.983
Fine.
I'll sit out this shift.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.484
But 72 hours from now...

08:05.569 --> 08:07.570
No early fatigue
when you exert?

08:07.737 --> 08:09.155
No need to
catch your breath?

08:09.239 --> 08:10.322
None.

08:11.283 --> 08:12.283
I swear.

08:19.374 --> 08:20.749
Hey, what happened to you?

08:20.917 --> 08:22.835
You get handsy with
the guys on truck again?

08:22.919 --> 08:24.461
Hey, this is your fault,
all right?

08:24.546 --> 08:26.505
Mills is filling in
for the spot on Squad.

08:26.590 --> 08:29.175
The house was about to
get McAuleyed,
so I had to step up.

08:29.259 --> 08:31.051
Oh, hey, that's great news
for Mills, right?

08:31.553 --> 08:32.845
You just missed
the craziest call.

08:32.929 --> 08:36.432
Unconscious victim,
multiple broken bones,
impaled on a lamppost.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.851
How the hell
did that happen?
Total mystery.

08:39.060 --> 08:42.146
He did say something
before he passed out though.
"Banana."

08:43.440 --> 08:44.899
Shay would have
loved that.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.151
Yeah, she would've.

08:48.111 --> 08:50.779
Hey, uh, I'm looking for
April Sexton?
Not here.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.325
I thought she worked here
Tuesday mornings.

08:54.409 --> 08:56.493
April's not on
the schedule anymore.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.958
Hit and run? Guy was
12 feet off the ground.

09:03.835 --> 09:05.711
But think about it though,
if he got hit by a city bus

09:05.795 --> 09:08.380
while he was crossing
the street, he could
get launched pretty high.

09:08.465 --> 09:12.927
Nah, to me it smells like
some kinda Jackass-style
stunt gone bad.

09:13.094 --> 09:14.720
What does banana mean?

09:14.930 --> 09:17.806
You know where
they grow bananas?
Colombia.

09:18.391 --> 09:21.644
These cartels get pretty
creative with distributors

09:21.728 --> 09:23.979
who don't hold up
their end of the deal.

09:24.481 --> 09:26.565
You guys learn anything else?
Nada.

09:26.858 --> 09:29.693
I guess we'll know more
when he comes to,
if he comes to.

09:34.950 --> 09:37.534
What's "Stilettos"?
It sounds like a strip club.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.329
Oh, God.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.082
It is a strip club,
isn't it?

09:43.166 --> 09:46.835
Yes, I landed
a construction contract
expanding a club

09:47.420 --> 09:49.380
called Stilettos.
Permits just came through.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.592
Lieutenant, uh, I've been
meaning to ask you,

09:53.677 --> 09:55.386
do you by any chance
need any strong backs

09:55.470 --> 09:57.763
for your side business,
'cause I could use
a little scratch.

09:57.847 --> 09:58.973
You don't say.

09:59.349 --> 10:01.809
Oh, are you looking
for guys, Casey?

10:01.893 --> 10:03.852
Because I know my way
around a toolbox.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.275
Fine.

10:15.824 --> 10:18.450
Maybe he was trying to
tell us that he slipped
on a banana peel.

10:18.868 --> 10:19.994
Could it have been
self-inflicted?

10:20.537 --> 10:21.537
Hey, Mills.

10:22.205 --> 10:23.247
Hey!

10:23.957 --> 10:24.999
What are you guys
doing here?

10:25.083 --> 10:26.625
Peter, are you back
on Squad already?

10:26.710 --> 10:29.545
Yeah.
Total surprise, actually.
Boden just sprung it on me.

10:29.629 --> 10:30.713
Come say hi to the guys.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.881
Actually, is there somewhere
we can go for
a little privacy?

10:34.843 --> 10:36.552
Sure. Yeah.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.973
You could throw a stone
and hit the water,
it's that close.

10:41.057 --> 10:43.809
I'm telling you, a little
revamp and this place could
be the beachfront hotspot.

10:43.893 --> 10:45.644
Okay, so then we renovate it
and we sell it.

10:45.729 --> 10:47.479
No, no.
We want to keep it.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.064
You're on board with this?
Mmm-hmm.

10:49.566 --> 10:53.527
Look, we...
We all agreed we're
selling the place, okay?

10:53.695 --> 10:57.406
This could be really good
for us, Peter. It's better
than just a cash buyout.

10:57.657 --> 10:58.991
Mom, I know
you don't want me
to be a firefighter.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.868
This isn't
about that, Peter.

11:00.952 --> 11:03.829
It's a chance for us
to build something
of our own again.

11:04.289 --> 11:06.999
You'd love Wilmington.
The weather, the people.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.418
There's this guy, Doc,
who used to...
Doc? That's his name?

11:09.502 --> 11:11.837
I guess, that's what
everyone calls him.
He's sort of a character.

11:11.921 --> 11:15.132
Anyway, he totally knows
the place, and he offered to
help us start it up again.

11:15.216 --> 11:18.719
You guys are getting into
business with some crazy local
who you just met, named Doc?

11:18.803 --> 11:20.095
Forget about him, Peter.

11:22.766 --> 11:24.767
The point is,
we want to give this a try.

11:25.769 --> 11:27.394
We're moving to
North Carolina.

11:42.202 --> 11:45.496
Hey. I heard what happened
with your mom and Elise.
Are you okay?

11:49.876 --> 11:50.959
What are you looking at?

11:52.045 --> 11:53.504
Doc's Facebook page.

11:54.130 --> 11:57.424
Who is that?
He is the idiot that
they're partnering with.

11:57.509 --> 12:00.677
Yeah. Guy's run
four restaurants
in the last six years.

12:00.762 --> 12:02.096
Guess how many are
still in business.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.682
Why is he dressed like that?

12:06.559 --> 12:08.394
Is he a Civil War
re-enactor?

12:11.106 --> 12:14.024
You know, I reached out
to my grandfather
to try and fix this family.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.694
Now I'm losing
what's left of it.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.991
So, you're not gonna
go with them?

12:23.326 --> 12:25.244
No, of course not.

12:25.328 --> 12:26.745
My whole life is here at 51.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.455
Plus, I just made
Squad again.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.170
Hey.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.464
How are you feeling?

12:37.841 --> 12:39.591
Like a million bucks.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.177
Ow, not so tight.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.430
Like a million bucks.

12:52.355 --> 12:53.397
Did you quit the hospital?

12:54.149 --> 12:57.109
I tried to,
but they gave me
paid leave instead.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.238
It was a real
wake-up call, Kelly.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.240
I'm taking a break.

13:04.033 --> 13:06.326
Gonna go see all the things
I've been missing out on.

13:07.245 --> 13:09.329
All of 'em?
Yeah, all of 'em.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.707
Because at any moment,

13:11.791 --> 13:15.419
a psycho with a grenade
can come along
and ruin your whole day.

13:17.380 --> 13:20.382
So, I bought myself
a round-the-world
plane ticket.

13:22.677 --> 13:27.931
Gonna start flying east,
picking destinations as I go,
wherever I feel like going.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.561
That, uh...

13:34.355 --> 13:35.772
That sounds amazing.

13:42.906 --> 13:44.656
Let me take you out
before you go.

13:46.284 --> 13:47.534
I don't have
a lot of time.

13:47.952 --> 13:50.037
Come on, we just reconnected,
now you're gonna leave?

13:50.497 --> 13:55.709
You hoping to take advantage
of my carpe diem phase,
try to get me in bed?

13:55.919 --> 13:58.837
I was thinking more along
the lines of dinner.

13:58.922 --> 14:01.757
But that's interesting,
that your mind goes there.

14:04.093 --> 14:07.429
I have so many loose ends
to tie up.

14:08.139 --> 14:10.349
Packing, putting stuff
in storage.

14:12.602 --> 14:13.602
I can't.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.647
But we'll get together
when I come back.

14:17.649 --> 14:19.274
I'm gonna hold you to that.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.209
So, it's my
sister-in-law's birthday,

14:37.293 --> 14:40.045
but I got a kid
that goes to bed
at 7:00.

14:40.129 --> 14:42.089
I don't want to
drag him out to Wheaton.

14:42.507 --> 14:45.467
So, before I know it,
I'm volunteering to host
this thing at my place.

14:45.969 --> 14:47.553
I can barely make
scrambled eggs.

14:47.637 --> 14:48.929
What am I gonna cook
for nine people?

14:49.973 --> 14:51.515
Tex-Mex Lasagna.

14:51.933 --> 14:54.184
Okay, I have no idea
what that is,
but that sounds amazing.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.771
It's super simple.
Twenty minutes prep time,
pop it in the oven.

14:57.981 --> 15:01.316
The one trick is, you gotta
remember the no-boil noodles.
They're...

15:02.402 --> 15:04.152
You know what?
I'll make it for you.

15:04.529 --> 15:06.446
This guy can cook.
Yeah?

15:08.491 --> 15:10.617
All right, fine,
but only if you join us.

15:11.619 --> 15:13.203
Ah, I got plans
with my sister.

15:13.288 --> 15:14.413
She's moving
to North Carolina.

15:14.497 --> 15:16.331
Yeah, bring her along.
I insist.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.501
Okay.

15:23.339 --> 15:26.216
Psst! Cruz, Otis.
Come here.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.599
I've been catching an earful
from all the hockey parents.

15:33.683 --> 15:36.184
They feel that
Coach Herrmann is
playing favorites.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.020
Starting his own son

15:38.104 --> 15:41.648
when there are other kids
that might do
better in the position.

15:41.733 --> 15:43.942
Yeah, it's a problem.
But what do we do?

15:44.152 --> 15:45.527
You gotta get Herrmann
to bench him!

15:46.946 --> 15:50.657
Luke takes one step
on the ice, it's gonna
cost us a championship.

15:51.034 --> 15:52.701
And $500?

15:53.620 --> 15:55.495
I'm thinking about
the children here, Brian.

15:55.830 --> 15:56.955
Mmm.
Mmm-hmm.

15:59.125 --> 16:02.044
Luke Herrmann has got
to ride the pine.

16:07.258 --> 16:10.552
- Ambulance 61, person injured.
- 609 North Union.

16:19.937 --> 16:20.979
This way,
they're in here.

16:21.064 --> 16:22.314
What's going on?

16:22.398 --> 16:25.734
Little rumble
in the cafeteria, got
the kids all worked up.

16:28.237 --> 16:30.072
All of you,
shut your faces now!

16:31.991 --> 16:33.659
Okay, what do we got?

16:33.743 --> 16:35.202
You touch my brother again,
you little bitch?

16:35.286 --> 16:36.662
Huh? Come on,
you want some of this?

16:38.289 --> 16:40.749
Whoa!
He hit my little brother!
Get the hell out of my way!

16:43.336 --> 16:44.753
Whoa!
Get outta my way!

16:45.254 --> 16:46.421
Come on,
you want some of this?

16:46.589 --> 16:47.547
Keith,
put that chair down!

16:47.632 --> 16:48.715
Yeah, boy! Get him!

16:48.800 --> 16:49.800
Come on now, Keith!

16:49.967 --> 16:51.426
You hit my little brother.
Get the hell out of my way!

16:52.345 --> 16:53.345
Yo!

16:57.433 --> 16:58.892
Get off me!
We got him, we got him!

16:58.976 --> 17:00.018
I got him.

17:00.103 --> 17:01.728
Stay down, kid.
Stay down!

17:11.114 --> 17:14.116
Hey, I've got some details
on your impalement victim.

17:14.283 --> 17:16.535
You figured out why
he ended up skewered
on a lamppost?

17:16.619 --> 17:20.497
No, but he ran some sort of
import business out of Miami.

17:20.581 --> 17:22.290
He does a ton of
international travel.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.875
Last seen at
a client meeting downtown.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.420
Steps out to take a call,
never comes back.

17:26.587 --> 17:28.380
We're still trying to locate
his next-of-kin.

17:28.464 --> 17:29.840
Did he import bananas?

17:30.341 --> 17:31.425
Sorry?

17:31.801 --> 17:33.927
I don't know, that was
the last thing he said
before he passed out.

17:34.011 --> 17:35.053
Bananas?

17:35.638 --> 17:37.305
No, I didn't ask
about bananas.

17:37.807 --> 17:40.434
Okay. I'll be sure to look
into that.

17:41.269 --> 17:42.269
Thanks.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.817
Where are the girls?

17:49.318 --> 17:51.486
They're in the other room,
working,

17:51.946 --> 17:53.363
which is what you're
supposed to be doing.

17:53.448 --> 17:54.990
Hand me that
rafter square, huh?

17:56.492 --> 18:00.495
Sure, you know your way
around a toolbox.
It's the blue triangle.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.789
Then why did you
call it a square?

18:04.417 --> 18:06.293
Whoa, look at all
this progress already!

18:06.377 --> 18:07.753
Hey, Jack.
How's it going?

18:07.837 --> 18:10.714
How are you? Jack Nesbitt.
You guys all work over at 51?

18:10.798 --> 18:13.133
Yeah. Hey, I'm uh, Brian.
Uh, but you can call me...

18:13.217 --> 18:14.342
Great, really great.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.261
I love throwing
a little work to
my CFD brothers.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.722
I didn't wanna keep you.
Just wanted to say hi.

18:24.187 --> 18:26.688
Hey, you guys want to see
some strippers?

18:27.356 --> 18:28.356
Yeah.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.193
Well, you should have gone
to a strip club. Come on.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.278
"My CFD brothers."

18:34.489 --> 18:37.032
You know, I asked Weathersby
about this guy Nesbitt.

18:37.116 --> 18:40.452
You wanna know why
he quit the CFD after
only seven years, huh?

18:40.536 --> 18:42.120
Here we go,
the town crier.

18:42.246 --> 18:44.790
He worked a fire
at a check cashing joint

18:44.874 --> 18:46.625
and he torched open
the safe during overhaul.

18:46.709 --> 18:50.253
Yeah. They couldn't
pin it on him,
but he agreed to resign.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.676
Hi. Do you guys want
something to drink?

18:57.261 --> 18:59.221
Jack asked me to
take good care of you.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.181
Nah, we're good, thanks.

19:01.766 --> 19:02.766
You're the boss.

19:03.059 --> 19:04.392
More like wrangler.

19:04.602 --> 19:06.603
I'm Katya.

19:06.938 --> 19:07.938
Hi.

19:08.439 --> 19:10.982
Jack asked if you could
come by the club on Saturday,
around 8:00 p.m.

19:11.067 --> 19:12.275
Sure, I'll swing by.

19:13.069 --> 19:14.903
Great. I'll see you then.
Okay.

19:21.953 --> 19:23.245
This job rocks.

19:24.455 --> 19:26.873
What were you doing
managing a restaurant
at 16?

19:26.958 --> 19:29.626
I don't know,
my mom was always cooking,

19:30.461 --> 19:32.462
and who else was
gonna do it, her?

19:32.922 --> 19:35.924
Uh, I could have.
I was just better at
handling customers.

19:36.050 --> 19:38.134
Yeah.
You know, hospitality?

19:40.012 --> 19:42.222
Sounds like it was a blast.
Yeah, I guess it was.

19:42.306 --> 19:43.598
I didn't think so
at the time though.

19:43.808 --> 19:45.559
I was always looking
at the horizon.

19:45.685 --> 19:46.810
You know, CFD.

19:46.894 --> 19:49.104
Well, you make a hell of
a Tex-Mex Lasagna.

19:49.313 --> 19:52.023
Logan would like
another piece of cake.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.861
Mmm. Oh, fine.

19:58.114 --> 19:59.239
There you go.
Thank you, Daddy!

19:59.323 --> 20:00.323
You got it, buddy.

20:00.449 --> 20:01.741
You go back there
and play?

20:01.993 --> 20:03.577
You got a great
family, Scott.

20:04.745 --> 20:07.080
It's cool you're so tight
with your wife's parents.

20:07.748 --> 20:08.748
Yeah.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.543
You know, when Angie died,
they were really there
for me.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.004
It means a lot
having them around.

20:14.130 --> 20:17.090
Logan's memory of his mom
is probably gonna fade,
you know?

20:17.174 --> 20:20.385
He will know her family,
always have that connection.

20:21.095 --> 20:22.095
Yeah, I, uh...

20:23.764 --> 20:25.265
I used to really take
family for granted.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.475
But not anymore.

20:29.604 --> 20:30.604
Hey.

20:32.690 --> 20:33.899
He's coming!

20:33.983 --> 20:36.151
I'm coming for you!
I'm coming for your cake!

20:36.319 --> 20:38.403
Oh, no!
He's getting your cake!
Get him, get him.

20:38.487 --> 20:39.446
Whoa!

20:43.784 --> 20:45.911
How sure are you
that he said "banana"?

20:46.662 --> 20:47.913
I heard what I heard,
Mouch.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.957
Bandana? Montana?

20:53.002 --> 20:54.002
Cabana?

20:54.754 --> 20:56.171
Bad mama jama.

20:57.214 --> 20:58.214
Pamplona.

21:00.051 --> 21:01.176
Bologna.

21:02.637 --> 21:03.887
Hey, Herrmie,
you got a minute?

21:03.971 --> 21:05.805
Yeah, guys, what's up?

21:09.602 --> 21:10.977
We gotta bench Luke.

21:11.062 --> 21:13.855
Hey, look.
We love the kid, obviously.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.273
It's just that he...

21:15.775 --> 21:19.444
A couple of other kids
deserve a chance
to start, too.

21:19.528 --> 21:22.197
Yeah.
Like, uh, Hill, Corbell...

21:22.281 --> 21:23.281
It's for the cup.

21:23.532 --> 21:27.869
And Luke's skills are, well,
for lack of a better word,
lacking.

21:31.540 --> 21:32.582
Get out of my bar.

21:33.709 --> 21:34.793
Herrmann, man, come on.
We're on...

21:34.919 --> 21:37.504
Out! Now! Both of youse!

21:39.215 --> 21:41.132
But, it's my bar, too.

21:56.857 --> 21:58.984
I got sick of packing.
I needed a break.

22:01.195 --> 22:02.821
That's your
packing outfit?

22:03.739 --> 22:06.825
I was trying things on
as I went,
had to make sure it fit.

22:09.954 --> 22:11.121
It fits.

22:12.373 --> 22:15.291
Do you remember summer
after junior year,

22:15.418 --> 22:19.004
when we went to Steph's roof
to watch that lightning storm
over the lake?

22:19.922 --> 22:21.089
Yep.

22:22.133 --> 22:25.051
We always made time to
get away from the crowd.

22:25.594 --> 22:28.138
Not sure I would've
made it through high school
without that.

22:31.142 --> 22:32.308
You remember

22:33.019 --> 22:35.145
how every time
a bolt of lightning
came down,

22:35.229 --> 22:38.523
I'd let out a yelp
and grab onto your arm
as tight as I could?

22:39.150 --> 22:40.650
Yeah, I remember.

22:42.778 --> 22:44.446
Whole thing was fakery.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.865
Just an excuse
to get close to you.

22:50.870 --> 22:51.953
I was curious

22:54.040 --> 22:55.790
what it would feel like.

22:58.461 --> 22:59.461
I still am.

23:33.579 --> 23:34.954
Chief.
Hey.

23:35.331 --> 23:36.498
Sorry to bug you
so late.

23:38.125 --> 23:39.334
Never mind that.

23:40.961 --> 23:42.504
What's the matter, Mills?

23:44.298 --> 23:47.425
I don't know if my dad
expected me to follow
in his footsteps.

23:48.219 --> 23:50.220
I do know that
he'd be proud that I did.

23:50.721 --> 23:51.805
Peter...

23:51.972 --> 23:53.181
I also know that

23:54.475 --> 23:56.726
he would've wanted me
to live my own life.

24:00.356 --> 24:01.481
Find my own path.

24:06.695 --> 24:08.863
I can't keep
chasing his ghost.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.959
I want to be with my family.

24:22.211 --> 24:23.586
My mom, Elise.

24:27.007 --> 24:28.883
I'm going
to North Carolina.

24:30.511 --> 24:31.636
Peter, don't rush into
anything.

24:31.720 --> 24:32.971
Please don't try and
talk me out of this.

24:35.558 --> 24:36.641
I made up my mind.

24:39.395 --> 24:40.436
I'm moving on.

24:58.622 --> 24:59.914
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:00.249 --> 25:01.249
Back up a minute.

25:02.293 --> 25:03.501
This some kind of joke?

25:05.129 --> 25:06.754
Where's the punchline?

25:06.839 --> 25:09.090
Believe me.
It was a difficult
decision to make.

25:09.967 --> 25:12.760
I don't get it,
you just got back
on Squad.

25:13.637 --> 25:16.848
And I have expanded Squad
so that Mills can finish
his last shift here.

25:16.932 --> 25:19.017
So let's make it
a good one, shall we?

25:19.101 --> 25:20.185
Peter Mills.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.645
It's been an honor and
a pleasure to work with you.

25:23.272 --> 25:25.523
Hope you know you always
have a home here at 51.

25:26.066 --> 25:27.108
Thank you, Chief.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.457
I'm gonna miss all of you.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.884
Hey, I guess
if you gotta go,

25:54.803 --> 25:56.596
we gotta have
a going-away party, right?

25:56.680 --> 25:59.224
At Molly's tomorrow night?
What do you say?

25:59.308 --> 26:00.433
Hell, yeah.

26:17.451 --> 26:18.576
Hey.

26:20.329 --> 26:22.330
You don't owe anyone
an explanation.

26:23.999 --> 26:27.126
Thank you.
I knew you'd understand.

26:28.629 --> 26:30.129
Oh, no. I don't.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.509
My point is that
you're the only one
who has to.

26:36.804 --> 26:40.056
The guys, they're just...
They're just gonna miss you,
is all.

26:40.849 --> 26:42.517
I'm going to miss you.

26:43.519 --> 26:44.727
Then come with me.

26:50.859 --> 26:52.944
Hey, Mills, you got a sec?

26:54.947 --> 26:55.947
Yeah.

27:01.704 --> 27:03.913
A, congratulations.

27:03.998 --> 27:05.873
B, don't carve anything
in stone.

27:06.375 --> 27:07.458
Meaning what?

27:07.710 --> 27:09.711
You just got back
on Squad, Mills.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.045
Where you belong.

27:11.463 --> 27:14.215
Use this last shift
as a sort of
cooling off period.

27:14.550 --> 27:16.843
Don't make any decisions
until the end of shift.

27:17.011 --> 27:18.803
That is all we are asking.

27:20.889 --> 27:23.057
Sure. Okay.

27:26.020 --> 27:28.813
Truck 81, Squad 3,
Ambulance 61,

27:28.897 --> 27:31.566
Battalion 25.
Traffic accident.
Cermak and Ashland.

27:42.494 --> 27:43.494
How bad is it?

27:43.579 --> 27:45.330
The hatchback blew through
the light at full speed.

27:45.414 --> 27:46.497
Driver's in bad shape.

27:46.582 --> 27:49.417
This one's a little banged up.
That one's bleeding
pretty good.

27:49.501 --> 27:52.003
Battalion 25 to main.
We need two additional
ambulances

27:52.087 --> 27:53.546
at Ashland and Cermak.

27:53.630 --> 27:55.506
Severide, check the
hatchback for pin-ins.

27:55.591 --> 27:56.924
Truck!
Yeah?

27:57.259 --> 27:58.593
Triage the other two.
Got it.

28:00.095 --> 28:02.555
Hey, you okay?
You got a name?
Yeah.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.849
Viri Sanchez.
Okay.

28:04.933 --> 28:05.933
Is my dad okay?

28:13.776 --> 28:15.109
Guy wasn't wearing
a seat belt.

28:15.444 --> 28:16.444
He, he took it off.

28:16.570 --> 28:17.737
He said it was hurting
his arm.

28:17.821 --> 28:19.322
I told him not to.
I told him to put it back on,

28:19.406 --> 28:21.115
but he just kept
holding his arm.

28:21.283 --> 28:22.367
Why was his arm hurt?

28:22.576 --> 28:24.952
I don't know,
but that's why he
took off his seat belt.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.204
Is he going to be okay?

28:26.330 --> 28:27.538
Hey Severide,
we gotta get him
out of there.

28:27.623 --> 28:29.082
He had a heart attack!
Daddy?

28:29.166 --> 28:30.583
Hey, I need a backboard
here, now!

28:30.876 --> 28:32.210
Please!
You gotta save him.

28:36.507 --> 28:37.632
Oh, my God.

28:48.435 --> 28:50.144
I need a medic!

28:50.729 --> 28:51.979
They're treating
another victim.

28:55.317 --> 28:56.484
How long ago
was the accident?

28:56.902 --> 28:58.486
I don't know,
five minutes ago?

28:58.904 --> 29:00.154
It's not too late,
come on.

29:02.658 --> 29:05.910
Dad! Oh, my God. Dad!
Is he okay? Is he okay?

29:05.994 --> 29:07.161
You see that guy
working on him?

29:07.913 --> 29:10.581
His name is Peter.
He knows what he's doing.
All right?

29:11.375 --> 29:12.959
Dawson, I need a monitor!

29:13.168 --> 29:14.710
Right. You got this?
Yeah, go.

29:16.839 --> 29:18.047
Rice! Bag him.
Yeah.

29:19.591 --> 29:22.510
He seemed fine.
We were talking
about our trip.

29:22.970 --> 29:24.929
He's taking me to
visit schools next week.

29:25.013 --> 29:26.139
Hey, come on.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.225
All right, Mills,
take a pulse.
Yeah.

29:35.691 --> 29:37.525
I got a pulse.
He's breathing.

29:39.361 --> 29:41.154
Brett!
Need you over here.

29:42.197 --> 29:43.531
Got this?
Got it.

29:44.199 --> 29:47.160
He's in a third degree
heart block. We need to
pace him at 70 milliamps,

29:47.244 --> 29:48.369
at a rate of 80.

29:49.204 --> 29:50.204
Ready?

29:50.289 --> 29:51.831
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

29:54.293 --> 29:55.793
Ready? Let's go.

29:58.380 --> 30:01.591
You saved him, Peter.
You did it. Thank you.

30:09.892 --> 30:10.892
Good job.

30:23.614 --> 30:26.324
Guys. Are you kidding me?

30:33.040 --> 30:36.542
Guy was on top of a truck.
Or a semi or something.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.252
Who's that now?

30:38.337 --> 30:40.213
Impalement victim.
If...

30:40.881 --> 30:42.131
If he was on top of a truck,

30:42.257 --> 30:43.424
he might have gotten
bumped off

30:43.509 --> 30:46.010
when the truck hit the seam
in the middle of
the draw bridge,

30:46.094 --> 30:47.094
landed on the lamppost.

30:47.262 --> 30:50.014
What was a businessman doing
on the roof of a semi?

30:50.098 --> 30:51.766
And how'd he get
all busted up?

30:52.643 --> 30:53.935
I don't know. Uh...

30:55.979 --> 30:57.271
Maybe it was
a suicide attempt.

30:57.731 --> 31:00.191
He jumped off a building,
truck broke his fall.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.693
Driver didn't notice,
he kept going.

31:02.778 --> 31:04.445
Was it possibly
a banana truck?

31:06.615 --> 31:07.782
Yeah.

31:12.329 --> 31:13.996
I don't get it, Mills.

31:17.167 --> 31:19.210
How could you walk away
from all this?

31:21.547 --> 31:23.172
Cruz, man, I...

31:25.509 --> 31:27.301
You saved that guy
back there.

31:28.679 --> 31:30.805
It takes a rare breed
to do what you did.

31:33.475 --> 31:35.685
You got the best job
in the world here, man.

31:37.312 --> 31:39.480
Don't you realize
how lucky you are?

31:56.290 --> 31:57.290
What you readin',
Herrmie?

32:02.004 --> 32:03.796
It wasn't banana.
It was Banan.

32:04.715 --> 32:06.841
Banan?
We just got back
from Chicago Med.

32:06.967 --> 32:08.050
The guy woke up.

32:08.135 --> 32:10.845
He told the nurses he
tried to kill himself
by jumping off a rooftop.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.388
But he came to on the roof
of a tractor-trailer.

32:12.889 --> 32:15.516
No way.
Unreal! Mills called it.

32:15.726 --> 32:17.602
Yeah.
What does Banan mean?

32:17.686 --> 32:20.062
It's a name of a woman.
He met her on a trip
to Syria.

32:20.230 --> 32:22.148
They got married,
and then the civil war
broke out.

32:22.232 --> 32:23.441
He couldn't get her
out of the country.

32:23.692 --> 32:25.610
They spent four years apart.

32:25.694 --> 32:29.113
And then, just the other day,
she was killed.
So, that's when he did it.

32:31.992 --> 32:35.453
Can you imagine
all that time,
separated from a loved one?

32:40.834 --> 32:42.043
So you're still going?

32:43.337 --> 32:44.462
I am.

32:49.259 --> 32:50.718
You're doing
the right thing, Mills.

32:53.722 --> 32:55.389
We got your back
no matter what, brother.

32:55.474 --> 32:58.225
We just had to make
sure you were sure.

33:04.816 --> 33:06.317
You are a born firefighter.

33:08.028 --> 33:10.237
You've been
an asset to this house
on every level.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.658
I knew leaving here
would be hard.

33:13.742 --> 33:14.909
You are not leaving.

33:16.119 --> 33:20.623
You're going to carry 51
with you wherever you go.

33:25.629 --> 33:27.755
I'm so proud of you guys.

33:27.923 --> 33:29.799
You worked really hard
to get here.

33:29.883 --> 33:33.761
And no matter what
that scoreboard looks like
at the end of all this,

33:33.845 --> 33:37.264
you guys already won.
You got spirit.
You got heart.

33:37.933 --> 33:40.434
And nobody can ever
take that away from you.

33:41.144 --> 33:42.269
Now that said,

33:43.605 --> 33:44.605
get in here.

33:46.108 --> 33:48.109
I want you guys to
go out there

33:49.277 --> 33:50.861
and kick some butt!

33:52.698 --> 33:53.906
Let's go, let's go!

33:53.990 --> 33:56.826
Hey, Zack, Zack. You're gonna
need a stick, buddy.
There you go.

33:57.577 --> 33:58.953
Let's go!
Let's go!

33:59.788 --> 34:03.666
Hey, Luke, buddy.
I gotta talk to you
for a minute. Okay?

34:06.294 --> 34:08.462
I'm gonna start Zack
at right wing.

34:09.423 --> 34:10.965
But that's my position.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.428
I know, buddy, I know.

34:16.763 --> 34:18.097
I gotta keep you
on the bench.

34:19.850 --> 34:20.850
Yeah!

34:41.413 --> 34:43.664
Hi, Matt.
Trish, remember?

34:44.040 --> 34:45.833
Hi, Trish.
I'm here to see Jack.

34:46.168 --> 34:47.752
He's, uh, kind of tied up
right now, but...

34:47.836 --> 34:49.170
I got it from here, Trish.

34:49.463 --> 34:51.881
Hi.
Hi. Let's get you a drink.

34:54.301 --> 34:55.676
Jack will be with you
in a moment.

34:56.261 --> 34:58.304
Yeah, I'm good
on the drink, thanks.

34:59.181 --> 35:01.098
So, uh,
what's going on?

35:02.100 --> 35:03.184
Who are those guys?

35:03.477 --> 35:05.519
Jack will
explain everything.

35:06.480 --> 35:09.523
Listen, Katya,
I can't wait long.

35:09.691 --> 35:12.818
There he is. Katya,
a couple of scotches, please.

35:14.029 --> 35:15.112
Hey.

35:15.822 --> 35:18.574
Matt, are you adverse
to making money?
No, not at all.

35:19.659 --> 35:20.951
See these guys
over there?

35:21.036 --> 35:22.787
I mean, they're not
much to look at,
but they are loaded,

35:22.871 --> 35:24.789
and they want to open
a whole chain of Stilettos.

35:24.873 --> 35:27.166
And I told them
you're just the guy
to build them.

35:27.250 --> 35:28.459
They'd like to meet you.

35:29.795 --> 35:32.213
Jack, I'm just here to do
a little construction work.

35:32.297 --> 35:35.633
I'm just offering you
a lot more construction work.

35:35.717 --> 35:37.551
Listen, sorry.
I hate to do this.

35:38.053 --> 35:40.554
I'm late to a friend's party.
A really good friend.

35:40.639 --> 35:42.807
I'm gonna get you
out of here in five minutes.

35:44.559 --> 35:45.684
Drink.

35:46.686 --> 35:47.812
Cheers.
Cheers.

35:53.693 --> 35:54.819
Hey. Molly's.

35:55.237 --> 35:56.237
Yeah.

35:58.698 --> 36:00.741
Do you really think she's
blowing off her flight?

36:01.076 --> 36:02.409
Man, that's confidence.

36:03.119 --> 36:04.620
Hey! A friend of yours
just called from O'Hare.

36:04.746 --> 36:06.997
Said to give you a scotch
and this.

36:12.796 --> 36:13.921
Jeez.

36:16.258 --> 36:18.425
Hey, where's Mills?
I didn't miss him, did I?

36:18.552 --> 36:20.636
Oh, no. He's, uh,
on his way here.

36:22.055 --> 36:23.347
Got some glitter
right there.

36:23.431 --> 36:25.766
Who wants to take
a picture with the cup?

36:25.851 --> 36:27.268
Yeah, baby!
Come here.

36:28.186 --> 36:30.521
Just smile. Aw,
you look good. Hey, Casey,
get in there, man!

36:33.066 --> 36:34.275
He's here!

36:44.452 --> 36:45.452
Thank you, guys.

36:47.122 --> 36:48.247
Party!

36:48.498 --> 36:49.748
Speech, speech, speech!

36:49.833 --> 36:51.166
Come on, man.
A few words.

36:51.251 --> 36:53.794
Oh, man,
I suck at these
kinds of things. Um...

36:55.797 --> 36:57.798
I just wanted to say
thank you.

36:59.301 --> 37:01.302
Working side-by-side
with all of you.

37:03.013 --> 37:06.098
I've learned a hell of
a lot more than just
how to do the job.

37:08.268 --> 37:10.436
I learned what it means
to be a brother.

37:12.022 --> 37:14.523
And how you do
whatever you can to
be there for each other.

37:16.860 --> 37:19.987
And the crazy thing is,
now I'm leaving this family
for another.

37:22.949 --> 37:27.328
But I wanted you all to know
that these three years,

37:29.831 --> 37:32.333
they've been the best time
of my life.

37:40.800 --> 37:43.886
Don't think for one second
I don't know how lucky
I've been.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.640
I will never forget that.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.517
We're the
lucky ones, Mills.

37:51.144 --> 37:53.312
Having you with us
as long as we did.

38:09.204 --> 38:10.788
Probably think
I'm crazy, huh?

38:10.872 --> 38:13.082
Walking away from 51,
right after I get on Squad.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.044
You figure out what you want,
you gotta go for it.

38:19.589 --> 38:21.340
I'm proud of you, Mills.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.133
I really am.

38:25.178 --> 38:28.138
All right,
quit hogging him, Severide.

38:30.350 --> 38:32.518
You ever change
your mind, Mills,

38:32.852 --> 38:34.937
you'll always have
a home here at 51.

38:50.370 --> 38:53.747
Hey. Um, I got
something for you.

38:55.417 --> 38:56.583
Thank you.

39:01.798 --> 39:04.550
Come on, come on.
Don't do this!

39:04.634 --> 39:05.634
Come on.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.082
Hey, Peter Mills.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.213
You forgot one.

39:54.184 --> 39:56.268
Things ever go south
for you here,

39:57.145 --> 39:59.271
or you decide
you're looking for a change,

40:01.483 --> 40:03.400
you know where to find me.

40:54.369 --> 40:55.786
Hey, hey.

40:55.870 --> 40:56.870
Sit, Pouchy.

40:57.413 --> 40:59.039
Come here.

41:02.043 --> 41:03.043
All right, girl.
