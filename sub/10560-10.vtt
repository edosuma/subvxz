00:53.050 --> 00:54.461
Two turns left before the final.

00:54.484 --> 00:56.486
Place your bets.

01:06.396 --> 01:08.171
10 loses.

01:10.167 --> 01:11.305
4 wins.

01:13.737 --> 01:15.512
That's it for me.

01:15.539 --> 01:17.746
You shouldn't risk everything
on one card, Hannah.

01:17.774 --> 01:20.220
This from the man who
leaves everything to chance?

01:20.243 --> 01:22.223
Only too true, Hannah.

01:22.245 --> 01:24.225
Place your bets. Come on, Magnus.

01:24.247 --> 01:25.521
Russell. Emily.

01:25.549 --> 01:26.789
I'll let mine ride.

01:26.817 --> 01:29.821
I'll add...

01:29.853 --> 01:31.628
four more checks.

01:34.458 --> 01:36.699
2 loses.

01:36.726 --> 01:39.172
Queen wins.

01:39.196 --> 01:40.607
You cheated, Jacob.

01:40.630 --> 01:42.303
What are you talking about?

01:42.332 --> 01:44.778
No one can win a game that's gaffed.

01:44.801 --> 01:46.678
I demand we inspect the cards.

01:46.703 --> 01:48.546
Show him the cards, Jacob.

01:48.572 --> 01:51.883
He won't be satisfied till we do.

01:52.109 --> 01:53.520
We need some more light.

01:53.543 --> 01:54.851
Fanny, would you be so kind?

01:54.878 --> 01:58.382
Yes, Mr. MacDonald.

01:58.415 --> 02:00.725
The filament must be
broken. Try the other lamp.

02:00.750 --> 02:01.785
Yes, sir.

02:03.620 --> 02:05.361
I'll fetch an oil lamp.

02:08.892 --> 02:10.336
Hurry up, Hannah.

02:10.360 --> 02:12.362
It's dark as Hades in here.

02:18.435 --> 02:19.573
Jacob?

02:23.507 --> 02:24.850
Oh, Jacob!

02:37.654 --> 02:38.632
Detective Murdoch.

02:38.655 --> 02:40.430
Dr. Grace.

02:40.457 --> 02:43.267
I'm surprised you were able
to make it here in the storm.

02:43.293 --> 02:45.569
I almost didn't.

02:48.598 --> 02:50.407
You were telephoned as well?

02:50.433 --> 02:52.640
I was here already.

02:52.669 --> 02:55.479
Oh. I see.

02:55.505 --> 02:57.610
Well, then I take it you knew the victim.

02:57.641 --> 02:59.746
Yes. Jacob Oliver.

02:59.776 --> 03:01.778
We went to medical school together.

03:01.811 --> 03:03.449
And is this his establishment?

03:03.480 --> 03:05.653
No, he's a guest of the owner,

03:05.682 --> 03:07.252
Magnus MacDonald.

03:07.284 --> 03:08.422
He lives here with
his sister-in-law,

03:08.451 --> 03:10.692
Hannah Beaumont.

03:10.720 --> 03:12.290
Sir.

03:12.322 --> 03:14.199
When will my guests be allowed to leave?

03:14.224 --> 03:15.601
Detective William Murdoch.

03:15.625 --> 03:17.969
I'm afraid everyone here
will have to be questioned.

03:18.195 --> 03:19.265
A poor end to what was supposed to be

03:19.296 --> 03:20.900
a splendid evening.

03:25.902 --> 03:28.280
These people are friends of yours, Doctor?

03:28.305 --> 03:30.478
A group of us get
together from time to time

03:30.507 --> 03:32.987
to play cards.

03:33.210 --> 03:35.417
What happened?

03:35.445 --> 03:39.416
We were playing when the
storm knocked out the lights.

03:39.449 --> 03:42.726
Suddenly Jacob was gasping
for air and clutching his neck.

03:42.752 --> 03:45.631
Iran to tend to him.
Russell tried to help too.

03:45.655 --> 03:47.464
- Russell?
- Russell Chisholm.

03:47.490 --> 03:49.731
He is the man at the bar with Magnus.

03:49.759 --> 03:52.968
He's a doctor as well.

03:52.996 --> 03:56.000
Hmm. Quite the game of cards.

04:04.374 --> 04:06.354
Your thoughts, Doctor?

04:06.376 --> 04:08.447
Jacob died of blood loss.

04:08.478 --> 04:10.583
Something is wedged in his neck

04:10.614 --> 04:12.787
that likely severed the carotid artery.

04:12.816 --> 04:16.286
I'll know more once I continue
my investigation at the morgue.

04:16.319 --> 04:18.026
I'm ready to take the body now.

04:18.255 --> 04:19.529
I'm afraid your examination

04:19.555 --> 04:21.262
will have to take place here, Doctor.

04:21.291 --> 04:22.429
What do you mean?

04:22.459 --> 04:24.530
The ferry to the mainland
isn't going anywhere

04:24.561 --> 04:25.972
until this storm lets up.

04:25.996 --> 04:28.374
We're here for the night.

04:31.901 --> 04:33.903
Are you quite all right, Doctor?

04:36.673 --> 04:39.677
I was sitting at a table with
my friends, playing cards,

04:39.709 --> 04:42.690
and one of them died in front of me.

04:42.712 --> 04:45.881
No, I'm not all right.

04:49.419 --> 04:50.864
A bloody nuisance.

04:50.887 --> 04:53.060
My whole force is out
dealing with emergencies-

04:53.290 --> 04:55.463
people stranded, washed-out roads.

04:55.492 --> 04:56.630
Cells at Station 2 are flooded.

04:56.660 --> 04:58.071
He needs to be housed.

04:58.295 --> 04:59.296
We don't want the poor sod

04:59.329 --> 05:00.740
catching his death, now, do we?

05:00.764 --> 05:02.937
Certainly not. Ned Watts.

05:02.966 --> 05:06.573
He's laying charges against
Randolph Means tomorrow.

05:06.603 --> 05:08.082
Randolph the Razor?

05:08.305 --> 05:09.443
You've got some stones.

05:09.472 --> 05:10.678
Nothing to do with stones.

05:10.707 --> 05:12.414
It's his neck or mine.

05:12.442 --> 05:13.614
I'll keep an eye on him.

05:13.643 --> 05:15.486
Appreciate it, Thomas.

05:15.512 --> 05:18.356
Crabtree, where the bloody
hell do you think you're going?

05:18.381 --> 05:20.327
Sir, I was going to catch
some of the vaudeville.

05:20.350 --> 05:21.954
They're giving out prizes of coal and ham

05:21.985 --> 05:24.329
to anyone who will brave the storm.

05:24.354 --> 05:25.958
Not tonight, you're not. I need you.

05:25.989 --> 05:27.491
He'll be signing a deposition

05:27.524 --> 05:29.085
at the Crown attorney's office tomorrow.

05:29.092 --> 05:31.766
I'll make sure that he
practices his penmanship.

05:31.795 --> 05:34.036
Does the Razor know that we have him?

05:34.064 --> 05:35.839
Who knows what the Razor knows?

05:39.102 --> 05:42.083
Crabtree, put him in the cells.

05:42.105 --> 05:43.448
Cells?

05:43.473 --> 05:44.850
I'm providin' evidence tomorrow,

05:44.874 --> 05:46.581
testimony that'll put Randolph the Razor

05:46.609 --> 05:47.917
on the sorry end of the noose.

05:47.944 --> 05:50.117
I'm not sitting in any cell.

05:50.347 --> 05:52.122
I suppose I could watch
him just was well here, sir.

05:52.349 --> 05:54.022
Well, don't be mollycoddlin' him.

05:57.954 --> 06:01.800
If Razor gets wind of where I am,

06:01.825 --> 06:03.463
we're all gonna die tonight.

06:11.801 --> 06:15.442
Will you be much longer, Detective?

06:15.472 --> 06:17.042
I'm afraid your guests
will have to stay put

06:17.073 --> 06:18.143
until the weather breaks.

06:18.375 --> 06:20.095
You may as well make
yourselves comfortable.

06:20.110 --> 06:21.714
Hmm.

06:21.745 --> 06:24.954
Very little blood spatter.

06:24.981 --> 06:27.985
I confess to being an
admirer of Conan Doyle.

06:28.017 --> 06:30.429
I take it you're familiar with him.

06:30.453 --> 06:32.023
I'm somewhat acquainted, yes.

06:32.055 --> 06:33.090
Hmm.

06:33.123 --> 06:34.727
I believe the reason for the lack of blood

06:34.758 --> 06:37.102
is that Jacob was clutching at his neck,

06:37.127 --> 06:39.038
trying to save his life.

06:40.630 --> 06:42.610
You were playing a game of faro, yes?

06:42.632 --> 06:44.168
We were.

06:44.401 --> 06:47.177
It's an elegant game in all its simplicity,

06:47.404 --> 06:51.546
a man's fate decided on the turn of a card.

06:51.574 --> 06:53.576
Hmm.

06:55.412 --> 06:57.551
The table's too wide for
anybody to reach across

06:57.580 --> 07:00.891
and stab the victim.

07:00.917 --> 07:02.658
Mr. MacDonald,

07:02.685 --> 07:05.029
I would prefer to conduct
my investigation alone,

07:05.054 --> 07:07.056
if you don't mind.

07:07.090 --> 07:08.592
Just trying to help, sir.

07:13.029 --> 07:14.975
How much longer is this going to go on?

07:14.998 --> 07:18.946
Apparently, until the good
detective is finished with us.

07:18.968 --> 07:21.448
Fanny, would you pour us a drink?

07:21.471 --> 07:23.473
We may as well get comfortable.

07:26.576 --> 07:27.919
Margaret, look, it can't be helped.

07:27.944 --> 07:29.082
I'll have a duty detective-

07:29.112 --> 07:31.558
Margaret?

07:31.581 --> 07:32.559
Margaret!

07:32.582 --> 07:34.186
Mar-Oh...

07:34.217 --> 07:35.696
Bollocks.

07:35.718 --> 07:37.129
We lost the telephone connection.

07:37.153 --> 07:38.598
That's likely due to the storm, sir.

07:38.621 --> 07:40.794
I know it's from the
bloody storm, Crabtree.

07:40.824 --> 07:43.236
I would like to write
out my deposition now,

07:43.460 --> 07:44.461
if I could.

07:44.494 --> 07:47.498
It can wait until morning.

07:47.530 --> 07:49.840
Doubt it can.

07:49.866 --> 07:52.005
Maybe there was no flood at Station 2.

07:52.035 --> 07:54.879
Maybe they just wanted me out of there.

07:54.904 --> 07:57.680
Razor intends on finishing me tonight

07:57.707 --> 08:00.017
and anyone who stands
in his way, I imagine.

08:00.043 --> 08:01.852
Well, he would have to make it through

08:01.878 --> 08:03.838
two highly trained officers
of the law to do that.

08:03.847 --> 08:05.258
You two?

08:05.482 --> 08:06.893
Roly and Poly?

08:06.916 --> 08:09.157
Know why they call him the Razor?

08:09.185 --> 08:12.530
Not for the means which
he dispatches his victims

08:12.555 --> 08:16.503
but because he's in possession
of an extremely sharp mind.

08:16.526 --> 08:17.800
Doubt you two are a match.

08:21.030 --> 08:23.874
You just watch your mouth, sunshine.

08:24.968 --> 08:26.811
- Here he comes!
- Sit down!

08:26.836 --> 08:27.940
Crabtree, answer the door.

08:28.972 --> 08:30.952
Constable Crabtree, get the door.

08:30.974 --> 08:33.078
- You'd best arm yourself.
- I said sit down!

08:34.110 --> 08:35.919
Please, I need refuge!

08:35.945 --> 08:37.856
Uh, we're having a situation.

08:37.881 --> 08:39.621
I know my rights!

08:39.649 --> 08:41.924
You're obliged to help me,

08:41.951 --> 08:44.659
or need I quote from
the Police Services Act?

08:44.687 --> 08:46.530
- The bloody hell?
- Fine, there's a stove here.

08:46.556 --> 08:48.263
You can warm yourself there, old man.

08:48.291 --> 08:49.702
Old man?

08:49.726 --> 08:52.036
I'm but 43.

08:54.931 --> 08:57.309
These are hardly ideal circumstances

08:57.534 --> 09:00.208
for such a delicate procedure.

09:00.236 --> 09:02.876
We have to conduct the
investigation from the mainland.

09:02.906 --> 09:04.908
It's not possible, Doctor.

09:07.644 --> 09:09.646
That's not enough light.

09:11.047 --> 09:13.084
- Where's the fuse box?
- I don't know.

09:14.651 --> 09:15.857
Perhaps it wasn't the storm

09:15.885 --> 09:17.831
that knocked out the lodge's power.

10:36.065 --> 10:38.306
What are you doing?

10:38.334 --> 10:39.813
Miss Beaumont.

10:39.836 --> 10:42.407
This is my studio.

10:42.639 --> 10:44.710
I'm conducting a murder investigation.

10:44.741 --> 10:46.721
I realize that,

10:46.743 --> 10:49.223
but it didn't happen here, did it?

12:08.991 --> 12:11.096
Does anyone recognize this pin?

12:12.729 --> 12:15.209
It had been jammed in
the socket of the lamp.

12:15.231 --> 12:18.075
Any attempt to turn it on
would have tripped the circuit.

12:18.101 --> 12:20.138
Who does it belong to?

12:20.169 --> 12:22.911
Um, it looks like one of
mine. It must have fallen out.

12:24.240 --> 12:27.449
But I don't know anything
about electrical thingamajigs.

12:27.477 --> 12:29.787
Mr. MacDonald asked for more light.

12:29.812 --> 12:31.792
When I went to turn on the first lamp,

12:31.814 --> 12:33.088
it didn't work.

12:33.116 --> 12:36.256
And that's when I left the
room to fetch the oil lamp.

12:36.285 --> 12:38.492
And did you return to
your seat, Miss Glover?

12:38.521 --> 12:41.502
No, I waited by the fireplace.

12:41.524 --> 12:44.971
Where you had a clear line of
sight to Mr. Oliver's chair?

12:44.994 --> 12:46.837
I couldn't see a thing.

12:46.863 --> 12:48.342
I stood where I was and
waited for Miss Hannah

12:48.364 --> 12:49.809
to return with the lamp.

12:49.832 --> 12:52.210
- You had already left the room?
- Yes.

12:52.235 --> 12:54.875
And did you see Miss
Glover upon your return?

12:54.904 --> 12:57.942
As she said, she was
standing by the fireplace.

12:57.974 --> 12:59.112
Hmm.

12:59.142 --> 13:01.554
And Mr. MacDonald?

13:01.778 --> 13:04.122
I had left a box of matches on the mantle.

13:04.147 --> 13:05.558
I stood up to get them.

13:05.782 --> 13:07.523
You knocked over the cigar stand.

13:07.550 --> 13:10.053
- Made quite a clatter.
- I did?

13:11.187 --> 13:12.860
I'm surprised you remember such a detail,

13:12.889 --> 13:14.800
given all the whiskey
you've consumed, Russell.

13:16.159 --> 13:18.366
I struck the match.

13:18.394 --> 13:21.034
Jacob was making dreadful noises

13:21.063 --> 13:24.101
as my sister-in-law
returned with a lamp,

13:24.133 --> 13:27.205
and we saw the ghastly sight.

13:27.236 --> 13:30.843
Then I went into the foyer
and telephoned the police.

13:30.873 --> 13:32.318
Detective Murdoch,

13:32.341 --> 13:34.343
I'm ready.

13:44.220 --> 13:45.460
What is it?

13:45.488 --> 13:47.024
I don't know.

13:47.056 --> 13:48.899
But the depth of the wound indicates

13:48.925 --> 13:51.872
that it entered his neck
with considerable force.

13:51.894 --> 13:54.101
Given the distance across the table,

13:54.130 --> 13:56.610
the killer must have used
some sort of firing mechanism.

13:56.833 --> 14:00.007
A sling, perhaps.

14:00.036 --> 14:02.380
Doctor, have a look at this.

14:02.405 --> 14:05.909
His fingertips are exceptionally smooth,

14:05.942 --> 14:08.445
almost as if they've been sanded down.

14:10.346 --> 14:12.451
I am not a part of any of this.

14:12.481 --> 14:15.018
Keep your voice down, Fanny.

14:15.051 --> 14:17.327
Miss Glover.

14:17.353 --> 14:18.957
What are you not a part of?

14:18.988 --> 14:20.228
I'm nothing more than the maid.

14:20.256 --> 14:22.065
I was just here to count cards

14:22.091 --> 14:23.229
so that everybody else could play.

14:23.259 --> 14:25.466
And to cover for Jacob's cheating.

14:33.603 --> 14:34.604
These cards are marked.

14:34.637 --> 14:35.581
Ah! I knew it!

14:35.605 --> 14:37.209
Bastard!

14:37.240 --> 14:39.049
It was Jacob's idea to involve a servant.

14:39.075 --> 14:41.385
We should have known then he was
planning on queering the game.

14:41.510 --> 14:43.547
Stop this.

14:43.579 --> 14:45.456
Fanny had nothing to do with this.

14:45.481 --> 14:48.018
Let the detective do his job, Hannah.

14:48.050 --> 14:49.529
There's no money on the table,

14:49.552 --> 14:50.952
yet you all had checks to play with.

14:50.953 --> 14:52.660
What were you playing for? Nothing.

14:52.889 --> 14:55.267
Just a friendly game of cards.

14:55.291 --> 14:58.272
Obviously, there was
something significant at stake.

15:03.933 --> 15:05.935
Dr. Grace?

15:05.968 --> 15:07.345
You have something to say?

15:09.572 --> 15:12.382
I'm not speaking to you
as a colleague, Doctor.

15:15.344 --> 15:17.688
What's going on here?

15:17.914 --> 15:19.916
You're right, Detective.

15:19.949 --> 15:21.394
The stakes were quite high.

15:21.417 --> 15:23.192
For God sakes, be quiet, Magnus.

15:23.219 --> 15:26.598
We have nothing to hide, Russell.

15:26.622 --> 15:29.535
What were you playing for, Mr. MacDonald?

15:31.027 --> 15:33.007
A chance to die, sir.

15:34.664 --> 15:38.476
We were playing for the chance to die.

15:49.645 --> 15:52.387
Playing for the chance
to die, Mr. MacDonald?

15:52.415 --> 15:54.292
That will require an explanation.

15:56.285 --> 15:59.528
We belong to the Society
for Metaphysical Exploration.

15:59.555 --> 16:04.732
Quite a lofty name for a
group of people playing cards.

16:04.961 --> 16:09.273
Faro is only an adjunct
to our purpose, Detective.

16:09.298 --> 16:12.973
Our society's based in serious
scientific experimentation.

16:13.002 --> 16:15.278
Which involves cold-blooded murder?

16:15.304 --> 16:17.147
The horrible event of this evening

16:17.173 --> 16:19.312
has nothing to do with our goal.

16:19.342 --> 16:21.686
Scientists and scholars
have long pursued a belief

16:21.711 --> 16:23.486
in the spirit world.

16:23.512 --> 16:26.288
Is your group attempting to
communicate with the dead?

16:26.315 --> 16:29.023
No, not attempting, Detective.

16:30.753 --> 16:32.528
We are succeeding.

16:32.555 --> 16:35.263
By putting ourselves in near-death states,

16:35.291 --> 16:37.703
we are crossing over to the other side.

16:38.561 --> 16:40.302
I find that hard to believe.

16:40.997 --> 16:42.476
At first, so did I.

16:42.498 --> 16:44.205
What happened?

16:46.369 --> 16:48.110
For some years,

16:48.137 --> 16:52.017
I've been trying to communicate
with my dead wife, Charlotte.

16:52.041 --> 16:54.487
I sought out a well-known medium,

16:54.510 --> 16:57.218
but it was a dreadful experience.

16:57.246 --> 16:59.021
The woman was a charlatan.

16:59.048 --> 17:00.356
And then?

17:00.383 --> 17:01.623
Arthur Conan Doyle came to Toronto

17:01.650 --> 17:05.223
to talk about spiritualism and
the presence of an afterlife.

17:05.253 --> 17:06.255
And you attended.

17:06.288 --> 17:10.531
Yes, Hannah and myself,
with my daughter, Lillian.

17:11.493 --> 17:16.739
Conan Doyle was convincing as
he talked about crossing over

17:16.766 --> 17:18.608
to the other side.

17:18.634 --> 17:21.637
The perfect hotel, he called it.

17:21.670 --> 17:23.809
Lillian was a medical student at the time.

17:24.040 --> 17:25.451
She was fascinated.

17:25.473 --> 17:29.149
A few days later, she introduced
us to her fellow students.

17:29.178 --> 17:30.748
Mr. Chisholm and Mr. Oliver.

17:30.780 --> 17:32.418
And Emily Grace.

17:32.448 --> 17:34.189
Dr. Grace?

17:34.216 --> 17:36.560
That surprises you?

17:36.585 --> 17:38.462
I thought her to be a scientist.

17:38.487 --> 17:42.799
Then you have a very
narrow view of science.

17:42.825 --> 17:44.805
The four students thought,
if it were possible

17:44.827 --> 17:46.534
to visit the portals of the other side,

17:46.562 --> 17:49.702
then why not prove it once and for all?

17:49.732 --> 17:55.808
So we started our experiments,
or travelling, as we call it.

18:10.086 --> 18:13.363
So, Crabtree, tell me about
this song-and-dance show

18:13.389 --> 18:14.424
you were supposed to attend.

18:14.457 --> 18:16.334
Oh, sir, I am sorry to be missing it.

18:16.358 --> 18:18.668
Um, duty calls and all,
but they were going to have

18:18.694 --> 18:20.537
a professional regurgitator there.

18:20.563 --> 18:22.668
Sir, it's a man who has
the ability to swallow

18:22.698 --> 18:25.178
almost any object, and
then he can bring it-

18:25.201 --> 18:27.579
I know what a regurgitator is.

18:32.541 --> 18:34.350
Sir, I wonder how the
detective is making out

18:34.376 --> 18:35.514
in the rain.

18:35.544 --> 18:37.148
I'm sure he's well-prepared.

18:37.179 --> 18:38.590
Yes, he always is, sir.

18:38.614 --> 18:40.491
Bloody Murdoch.

18:40.516 --> 18:42.196
Never a hair out of place on him, is there?

18:42.218 --> 18:43.322
Hmm.

18:43.352 --> 18:45.161
He's a fastidious chap, to be sure.

18:45.187 --> 18:46.632
Quite annoying sometimes.

18:46.655 --> 18:48.794
Well, annoying is harsh term.

18:48.824 --> 18:50.531
Stick in the mud.

18:50.559 --> 18:52.596
You ever seen him laugh?

18:52.628 --> 18:54.437
I've seen him smile.

18:54.463 --> 18:56.136
I've even seen him smirk,

18:56.165 --> 18:58.202
so he does project a sense
of being somewhat amused

18:58.234 --> 18:59.372
from time to time.

18:59.401 --> 19:02.871
Man needs to loosen up. Life's too short.

19:02.905 --> 19:05.283
Fancy a wee swallow, Crabtree?

19:05.307 --> 19:06.513
Keep out the cold?

19:06.542 --> 19:08.180
Oh, sir, don't mind if I do.

19:08.210 --> 19:10.212
Ah. Good lad.

19:13.749 --> 19:16.423
Oh, that's refreshing. Thank you, sir.

19:16.452 --> 19:18.728
One thing I will admit is somewhat annoying

19:18.754 --> 19:19.926
about the detective, sir,

19:20.156 --> 19:21.760
is that he's always
telling me to pay attention

19:21.790 --> 19:23.565
to the small details.

19:23.592 --> 19:26.937
"Now, George, pay attention
to the small details," he says.

19:27.163 --> 19:29.473
It's almost as if he forgets lam a writer.

19:29.498 --> 19:30.499
Of course.

19:35.905 --> 19:37.782
The traveler is injected with a solution

19:37.806 --> 19:41.344
of chloral hydrate to
induce a hypnotic state.

19:42.211 --> 19:43.952
Once in a deep sleep,

19:44.180 --> 19:45.682
the traveler is placed into a bath

19:45.714 --> 19:49.218
surrounded by packed ice
to keep the water cold.

19:49.251 --> 19:50.958
Hypothermia protects the internal organs

19:51.187 --> 19:54.225
and increases the comatose state.

19:54.256 --> 19:56.600
- And who supervised this?
- We all did.

19:56.625 --> 19:58.502
We have the medical qualifications.

19:58.527 --> 20:03.499
How long is the traveler
left in this suspended state?

20:03.532 --> 20:08.606
Uh, it varies depending on
the body's size and weight.

20:08.637 --> 20:11.743
Once the heart rate drops
below what we consider viable,

20:11.774 --> 20:13.685
the traveler is brought back.

20:13.709 --> 20:15.655
With this caffeine citrate?

20:15.678 --> 20:16.918
Yes.

20:16.946 --> 20:19.449
The resulting shock
stimulates the heart and lungs.

20:19.481 --> 20:22.587
What does this have to
do with a game of faro?

20:22.618 --> 20:24.620
Faro's a game of chance.

20:24.653 --> 20:28.567
We leave the choice of who
travels each year to fate.

20:28.591 --> 20:30.332
And who was winning this evening?

20:30.826 --> 20:32.806
Jacob Oliver.

20:32.895 --> 20:34.841
Well, it would appear Mr.
Oliver has been granted

20:34.863 --> 20:38.538
a one-way ticket to the great beyond.

20:38.567 --> 20:43.380
How can you willingly subject
yourselves to such risk?

20:43.405 --> 20:46.443
Explorers are risk takers, Detective.

20:46.475 --> 20:48.421
They travel to the ends of the earth.

20:48.444 --> 20:52.620
We are trying to do more than that.

20:52.648 --> 20:54.685
We're trying to find heaven.

21:04.360 --> 21:07.341
So have you warmed yourself?

21:07.363 --> 21:09.001
I have indeed.

21:09.031 --> 21:10.874
I'll have to send you
out when the rain lets up.

21:10.899 --> 21:12.901
Eh, sure.

21:12.935 --> 21:14.278
Drink?

21:14.303 --> 21:15.577
Oh, never touched the stuff.

21:15.604 --> 21:18.414
Uh, I like to keep my mind sharp.

21:18.440 --> 21:21.011
I don't mind the odd dram.

21:21.043 --> 21:22.784
Not bloody likely.

21:29.385 --> 21:30.921
What is it, Crabtree?

21:30.953 --> 21:34.400
Sir, do you have any idea
what the Razor looks like?

21:34.423 --> 21:35.959
Can't say I do. Why?

21:35.991 --> 21:38.870
Because I hear he likes
to keep his mind sharp.

21:42.398 --> 21:44.969
Watts, have you ever seen the Razor?

21:45.000 --> 21:46.502
Not me.

21:46.535 --> 21:48.537
No one knows what the Razor looks like.

21:52.675 --> 21:55.952
Jacob was determined
to be the next traveler.

21:55.978 --> 21:57.924
That's why he cheated.

21:57.946 --> 22:00.893
Surely, you were all
equally anxious to win.

22:00.916 --> 22:02.589
Naturally, Detective.

22:02.618 --> 22:05.394
I was longing to see my beloved wife again.

22:05.421 --> 22:06.900
You hadn't yet travelled?

22:06.922 --> 22:10.768
I was the first to go,
but it was uneventful.

22:10.793 --> 22:14.331
I fell into a deep sleep but saw nothing.

22:14.363 --> 22:16.400
A dull headache was my only reward.

22:16.432 --> 22:18.434
We were too conservative
with the chloral hydrate dose

22:18.467 --> 22:19.707
the first time.

22:19.735 --> 22:22.375
So you increased the dosage.

22:22.404 --> 22:24.611
Who was next?

22:24.640 --> 22:27.883
- Jacob.
- He came back ecstatic.

22:27.910 --> 22:29.912
He'd met Thomas Addison.

22:29.945 --> 22:32.391
Addison? The British doctor?

22:32.414 --> 22:35.623
Yes, one of the pioneers
of adrenal research.

22:35.651 --> 22:39.098
Addison and Jacob had an
exchange on the other side.

22:39.121 --> 22:42.568
Dr. Addison validated Jacob's
ideas on adrenal extracts.

22:42.591 --> 22:43.968
So he says.

22:43.992 --> 22:45.494
I had no reason to doubt him.

22:45.527 --> 22:48.133
He was a liar and a cheat.

22:51.433 --> 22:53.106
Russell and Jacob

22:53.135 --> 22:56.412
were quite competitive
medical researchers, Detective.

22:56.438 --> 23:00.409
Both wanted to ascend
the staircase to heaven.

23:01.677 --> 23:04.021
You don't come across
many master criminals.

23:04.046 --> 23:05.491
No, that you don't.

23:05.514 --> 23:07.152
A man with the Razor's reputation,

23:07.383 --> 23:08.623
you would think that somebody

23:08.650 --> 23:10.095
would have caught a glimpse of him by now.

23:10.119 --> 23:12.929
You know, sir, it's a shame
Detective Murdoch is not here.

23:12.955 --> 23:14.935
We don't need Murdoch.
We're proper coppers.

23:14.957 --> 23:16.732
Oh, yes, but, sir, Detective Murdoch-

23:16.759 --> 23:20.036
there may not be a keener mind
in any police station anywhere.

23:20.062 --> 23:21.564
Hence the reason why I hired him.

23:21.597 --> 23:23.042
And good on you for that, sir.

23:23.065 --> 23:24.442
Have a seat, Crabtree.

23:24.466 --> 23:25.809
I mean, without him,

23:25.834 --> 23:29.748
this station might never
solve a case at all.

23:29.772 --> 23:32.116
Now, hold on, Crabtree.

23:32.141 --> 23:34.087
I wouldn't go that far.

23:34.109 --> 23:36.055
I've solved many cases in my time.

23:36.078 --> 23:39.025
You don't rise to the upper
echelon of the police department

23:39.047 --> 23:40.958
without demonstrating
considerable accomplishment.

23:40.983 --> 23:42.485
Well, yes, sir.

23:42.518 --> 23:43.690
I don't doubt your past achievements

23:43.719 --> 23:45.392
back when you were in your prime.

23:45.421 --> 23:46.866
But I mean recently.

23:46.889 --> 23:48.129
Prime?

23:48.157 --> 23:50.433
Son, what you don't understand

23:50.459 --> 23:52.461
is that I have myriad
other duties that hinder

23:52.494 --> 23:55.498
my ability to sink my teeth into a case.

23:55.531 --> 23:57.807
The politics of the job
is a time-consuming task.

23:57.833 --> 23:59.403
But given the chance...

23:59.435 --> 24:00.937
Well, sir, if you don't mind me saying,

24:00.969 --> 24:03.415
as commanding officer,
surely you have the authority

24:03.439 --> 24:06.477
to take the lead over any case
that comes through the door.

24:06.508 --> 24:10.012
That may be, but have you
considered the human dynamic?

24:10.045 --> 24:11.422
If I were to do that,

24:11.447 --> 24:13.791
wouldn't I be stepping on
Detective Murdoch's toes?

24:13.816 --> 24:16.422
That's what I mean when
I talk about the politics.

24:16.452 --> 24:18.864
I have to think about the
morale of the station as a whole.

24:18.887 --> 24:20.730
Uh, yes, of course, sir.

24:20.756 --> 24:24.033
But that old man, he may be
worth further conversation.

24:24.059 --> 24:26.437
- Right.
- Sit down, Crabtree.

24:26.462 --> 24:29.033
I'll handle it...

24:29.064 --> 24:30.975
when it's time.

24:34.870 --> 24:34.902
I take it you also wanted to win the game.

24:34.903 --> 24:38.043
I take it you also wanted to win the game

24:38.073 --> 24:40.713
and travel to the other
side, Miss Beaumont.

24:40.742 --> 24:43.120
I'm an artist, Detective.

24:43.145 --> 24:45.921
The depiction of inner beauty-

24:45.948 --> 24:47.985
the soul, if you will-

24:48.016 --> 24:51.463
is what I strive for.

24:51.487 --> 24:53.728
A spiritual journey would be invaluable.

24:54.890 --> 24:57.666
And Jacob Oliver's enlightening experiences

24:57.693 --> 24:59.764
no doubt encouraged you all.

24:59.795 --> 25:01.638
Yes.

25:01.663 --> 25:04.143
He was a changed man afterwards,

25:04.166 --> 25:06.043
full of confidence and determination

25:06.068 --> 25:08.605
to further pursue his research.

25:09.538 --> 25:11.142
And Mr. Chisholm?

25:11.173 --> 25:14.484
Well, Russell was desperate
to have the same experience.

25:14.510 --> 25:18.686
The doctors were competitive
in all things, Detective.

25:18.714 --> 25:20.819
- All things?
- Yes.

25:21.783 --> 25:23.990
Including the affections of Lillian.

25:24.853 --> 25:27.094
Lillian. Your niece.

25:28.590 --> 25:30.695
Yes.

25:30.726 --> 25:32.706
There were advances from
both men over the years,

25:32.728 --> 25:36.835
but Lillian's a new woman.

25:37.833 --> 25:41.542
No intention of tying
herself to a marriage.

25:41.570 --> 25:44.813
Her career was always far too important.

25:44.840 --> 25:47.650
And she was also involved
in the experimentations

25:47.676 --> 25:49.212
that you had all been conducting?

25:51.179 --> 25:52.852
Very much so.

25:52.881 --> 25:55.760
Then why isn't Lillian here this evening?

25:58.887 --> 26:00.594
I cannot capture her.

26:02.090 --> 26:04.070
Will you please tell me
what is going on here?

26:04.092 --> 26:05.833
I don't know what you mean, Detective.

26:05.861 --> 26:07.898
You were not forthcoming
about your association

26:07.930 --> 26:09.273
with this group, Doctor.

26:09.298 --> 26:11.938
I didn't see how it
related to Jacob's death.

26:11.967 --> 26:14.811
I am conducting a murder
investigation, Doctor.

26:14.836 --> 26:17.646
You have participated in the
activities of this society

26:17.673 --> 26:19.277
and withheld that information from me.

26:19.308 --> 26:21.948
Our experiments are conducted
with great care and scrutiny

26:21.977 --> 26:23.547
under medical supervision.

26:23.579 --> 26:24.956
We were breaking no laws.

26:24.980 --> 26:26.721
What else is going on here

26:26.748 --> 26:28.250
you've chosen not to share with me?

26:28.283 --> 26:30.627
Nothing.

26:30.652 --> 26:32.063
Who are you protecting?

26:32.087 --> 26:33.361
No one.

26:35.290 --> 26:37.292
Lillian MacDonald was a founding member

26:37.326 --> 26:39.067
of this society.

26:39.094 --> 26:41.597
Why was she not at tonight's game?

26:41.630 --> 26:43.109
I wish she were.

26:43.131 --> 26:44.906
Dr. Grace, answer me.

26:49.004 --> 26:50.677
Lillian didn't return.

26:50.706 --> 26:51.980
Return from where?

26:56.845 --> 26:58.347
She was a traveler.

26:58.380 --> 27:00.758
It was her idea.

27:02.217 --> 27:03.218
What happened?

27:05.654 --> 27:08.658
Dr. Grace, what happened?

27:11.026 --> 27:12.835
I killed her.

27:14.363 --> 27:16.070
I killed Lillian.

27:25.407 --> 27:27.887
Dr. Grace, the truth this time.

27:27.909 --> 27:29.752
What happened to Lillian?

27:33.248 --> 27:36.661
Lillian was the architect
of our experiments.

27:36.685 --> 27:39.632
After Jacob travelled and saw Dr. Addison,

27:39.655 --> 27:41.896
she was determined to go further.

27:41.923 --> 27:43.698
She would have done anything.

27:43.725 --> 27:45.636
She was as competitive as the other two.

27:45.661 --> 27:46.867
More so.

27:46.895 --> 27:50.274
Jacob said he saw a level beyond his reach.

27:50.298 --> 27:52.005
Lillian was resolved to get there.

27:52.034 --> 27:53.945
And how were you involved?

28:00.742 --> 28:02.415
Lillian won the game last year

28:02.444 --> 28:05.357
and asked me to preside
over her transition.

28:05.380 --> 28:07.417
I was touched by her trust.

28:07.449 --> 28:09.156
You had never presided before?

28:09.184 --> 28:11.664
No. It was always Lillian.

28:11.687 --> 28:13.360
She was in charge of the dosage.

28:13.388 --> 28:15.868
She had researched the
chemicals and their effects.

28:16.358 --> 28:18.133
What happened?

28:18.160 --> 28:20.071
She wanted to go deeper.

28:31.406 --> 28:32.908
She asked me to inject her

28:32.941 --> 28:35.319
with a higher dose of chloral hydrate.

28:38.213 --> 28:39.317
And that killed her?

28:39.347 --> 28:40.951
No. I refused.

28:48.390 --> 28:50.165
That wasn't the cause of her death.

28:50.192 --> 28:51.796
Continue.

28:51.827 --> 28:54.433
Once the choral hydrate took effect,

28:54.463 --> 28:56.739
we placed her in the ice bath.

29:00.869 --> 29:02.041
It's time.

29:02.070 --> 29:05.017
Jacob, hand me the caffeine.

29:18.453 --> 29:22.026
I injected the caffeine
citrate in plenty of time.

29:22.057 --> 29:24.731
But it wasn't sufficient to revive her?

29:24.760 --> 29:28.401
On the contrary.

29:29.865 --> 29:32.505
Instead of the normal acceleration,

29:32.534 --> 29:35.572
her heart began to race violently.

29:36.805 --> 29:39.513
She was gasping for breath.

29:45.013 --> 29:48.790
And then her heart stopped.

29:48.817 --> 29:50.524
I couldn't revive her.

29:53.121 --> 29:54.429
We were all shocked.

29:54.456 --> 29:56.163
Hannah was devastated,

29:56.191 --> 29:58.102
and she has never recovered.

29:58.126 --> 30:00.868
She works constantly to bring
Lillian back in sculpture,

30:00.896 --> 30:04.844
and she's never satisfied.

30:04.866 --> 30:06.209
She blames you.

30:06.234 --> 30:08.214
Actually, no.

30:08.236 --> 30:10.477
It's my own conscience
that won't forgive me.

30:10.505 --> 30:13.486
Even after a failed experiment,

30:13.508 --> 30:16.284
you all decided to attempt it again?

30:16.311 --> 30:19.520
I still believe in what
we are trying to do.

30:19.548 --> 30:22.461
The scientific advancement,
the endless possibilities...

30:22.484 --> 30:25.260
it's worth the risk.

30:25.287 --> 30:27.062
Could someone have tampered with the dosage

30:27.088 --> 30:28.431
of caffeine citrate?

30:28.456 --> 30:29.833
Even if that were so,

30:29.858 --> 30:31.895
it would never have provoked
such an extreme reaction.

30:31.927 --> 30:35.397
Doctor, you take
responsibility for her death,

30:35.430 --> 30:37.239
yet you defend your procedure.

30:37.265 --> 30:39.267
She died of heart failure.

30:39.301 --> 30:41.440
Surely, you have an alternate theory.

30:41.469 --> 30:43.176
What are you suggesting?

30:43.205 --> 30:44.548
Given the meticulous way

30:44.573 --> 30:47.417
in which Jacob Oliver was murdered,

30:47.442 --> 30:51.288
it's quite possible the
two deaths are related.

31:08.396 --> 31:11.240
How come you came to
this particular station

31:11.266 --> 31:14.008
on this particular night?

31:14.035 --> 31:15.537
I was seeking shelter.

31:15.570 --> 31:18.073
Nothing more?

31:18.106 --> 31:19.517
You better be telling the truth,

31:19.541 --> 31:22.021
or I'll put you on a charge of vagrancy.

31:22.043 --> 31:24.387
How do you fancy a week in the cells?

31:24.412 --> 31:27.882
I was simply trying to get out of the rain.

31:29.017 --> 31:31.054
Perhaps your judgment is clouded.

31:31.086 --> 31:34.329
I know mine certainly was before
our Lord and Savior convinced me

31:34.356 --> 31:36.063
to give up the bottle.

31:36.091 --> 31:38.901
Have you considered the road to His light?

31:41.897 --> 31:43.274
Sir.

31:43.298 --> 31:44.777
What is it, Crabtree?

31:44.799 --> 31:46.278
Just got a wire from Station House 2.

31:46.301 --> 31:47.541
They're coming back to pick up Watts.

31:47.569 --> 31:50.140
Apparently, they've staunched
the flooding in their cells.

32:04.152 --> 32:06.132
Mr. MacDonald?

32:14.129 --> 32:15.130
What did you tell him?

32:15.163 --> 32:17.507
He found out about Lillian.
I told him the truth.

32:17.532 --> 32:19.068
Why would you bring her into this?

32:19.100 --> 32:20.511
Lillian's death was an accident.

32:20.535 --> 32:22.481
Jacob's was no accident, to be sure.

32:22.504 --> 32:23.505
You mean Mr. Oliver.

32:23.538 --> 32:25.040
Don't forget your station

32:25.073 --> 32:26.609
just because your betters keep dying off.

32:26.641 --> 32:28.314
Russell, mind your tongue.

32:33.481 --> 32:35.051
The murder weapon.

32:37.385 --> 32:40.332
And it belongs to you, Mr. MacDonald.

32:40.355 --> 32:42.164
It's a holdout.

32:42.190 --> 32:44.397
Used by gamblers to cheat at cards.

32:44.426 --> 32:48.169
Yes, but it certainly wasn't
built to shoot objects.

32:48.196 --> 32:50.472
It slips a card into the player's hand

32:50.498 --> 32:53.172
by pressing against this lever.

32:53.201 --> 32:55.545
It can't propel the card across a room.

32:55.570 --> 32:58.141
All it would need is a
stronger, shorter spring,

32:58.173 --> 32:59.277
which it now has.

32:59.307 --> 33:01.309
Anybody could have done that.

33:01.343 --> 33:03.186
This room is never locked.

33:03.211 --> 33:04.713
Everyone knows of my collection.

33:07.182 --> 33:09.059
You were a gambler, Mr. MacDonald?

33:09.084 --> 33:11.325
I was a gambler,

33:11.353 --> 33:14.562
never a cheater, and
certainly not a killer.

33:16.591 --> 33:19.367
What about all this?

33:19.394 --> 33:24.241
This blade was a favorite
of Doc Holliday's.

33:24.265 --> 33:26.677
Concealed it in his sleeve.

33:26.701 --> 33:29.682
These cards belonged to Canada Bill Jones-

33:29.704 --> 33:33.618
roughened on one side so two
cards will stick together.

33:33.641 --> 33:35.484
His fingers were like silk,

33:35.510 --> 33:40.653
sanded down to be more
sensitive to the cards.

33:40.682 --> 33:45.427
Just like Jacob Oliver's fingers.

33:45.453 --> 33:47.126
You realized he was attempting

33:47.155 --> 33:50.329
to cheat you out of your chance
to see the gates of heaven,

33:50.358 --> 33:51.564
so you killed him.

33:51.593 --> 33:54.267
I'm not that desperate, Detective.

33:54.295 --> 33:58.038
Lillian, Jacob, and Russell
were the determined ones.

33:58.066 --> 34:01.070
The holdout would have enough
force to fire across the table

34:01.102 --> 34:03.139
and pierce Jacob's neck.

34:03.171 --> 34:05.674
But I don't see how that helps us.

34:05.707 --> 34:09.052
If anything, it places
everyone back under suspicion.

34:09.077 --> 34:10.385
Not everyone.

34:10.411 --> 34:12.016
Whoever killed Jacob Oliver

34:12.047 --> 34:13.389
would have had to have been standing

34:13.415 --> 34:15.190
almost directly in front of him.

34:15.216 --> 34:17.492
Based on where you were seated
at the time of his murder,

34:17.518 --> 34:19.726
you can be exonerated.

34:19.754 --> 34:22.166
I must confess, I'm relieved.

34:22.190 --> 34:24.192
As am I, Detective.

34:24.225 --> 34:28.230
Straight on target would
mean either Hannah or Russell

34:28.263 --> 34:30.139
was the perpetrator.

34:30.165 --> 34:31.438
Hannah was out of the room,

34:31.466 --> 34:34.504
so the only other possibility is...

34:34.536 --> 34:36.482
Mr. Chisholm.

34:39.373 --> 34:43.150
The two of you were scientific rivals.

34:43.178 --> 34:45.818
A little healthy competition, yes.

34:45.847 --> 34:47.849
Nothing worth killing over.

34:48.083 --> 34:50.495
You were also rivals
for Lillian's affections.

34:51.719 --> 34:54.824
I could have had Lillian if I wanted her.

34:56.190 --> 34:59.195
You and Mr. Oliver were both
present at Lillian's death?

34:59.227 --> 35:01.707
Yes. An unfortunate result.

35:01.729 --> 35:04.539
So she was just the subject
of an experiment, then?

35:04.566 --> 35:06.102
I beg your pardon.

35:06.134 --> 35:09.411
Mr. Chisholm, you don't
seem particularly affected

35:09.437 --> 35:11.678
by either Lillian's untimely death

35:11.706 --> 35:13.743
or Mr. Oliver's murder.

35:13.775 --> 35:15.516
So you think I killed them?

35:17.579 --> 35:21.459
Do you have any idea what
this could possibly be?

35:21.616 --> 35:24.495
No.

35:24.519 --> 35:25.862
Not at all.

36:25.180 --> 36:26.682
Russell!

36:34.422 --> 36:35.901
Is he alive?

36:35.924 --> 36:37.335
Barely.

36:48.803 --> 36:50.009
Hurry, Russell!

36:52.540 --> 36:54.213
Here.

37:33.514 --> 37:34.754
Who killed you?

37:45.760 --> 37:46.898
- Move!
- What are you doing?

37:46.928 --> 37:48.635
Trust me!

38:06.914 --> 38:08.484
No.

38:11.052 --> 38:12.861
I don't understand.

38:12.887 --> 38:14.457
It should have worked.

38:14.489 --> 38:15.627
His heart's stopped.

38:15.657 --> 38:18.035
It won't circulate if
the heart isn't beating.

38:19.861 --> 38:22.034
Beat, damn you. Beat!

38:22.063 --> 38:23.872
What did you give him, Russell?

38:23.898 --> 38:24.899
Beat!

38:42.917 --> 38:44.726
Beat!

38:44.752 --> 38:46.698
Beat, damn you!

38:46.721 --> 38:48.997
Beat! Beat!

38:49.023 --> 38:50.058
Beat!

38:53.661 --> 38:55.368
- Detective!
- Detective!

38:55.396 --> 38:56.397
Detective Murdoch.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.407
Inspector Graves asked me to
convey his appreciation, sir.

39:02.437 --> 39:04.278
We could have held him
the rest of the night.

39:04.339 --> 39:05.716
No need.

39:05.740 --> 39:07.913
My inspector wants the glory on this one.

39:10.044 --> 39:12.046
Come along, sir.

39:20.054 --> 39:22.091
I'll escort you to the wagon.

39:22.123 --> 39:23.363
That's not necessary.

39:23.391 --> 39:24.995
Oh, I don't mind.

39:25.026 --> 39:27.768
Sir, arm yourself.

39:29.797 --> 39:32.835
Good God.

39:32.867 --> 39:34.369
It worked.

39:34.402 --> 39:36.746
What did you use to bring him back?

39:36.771 --> 39:39.012
I took an extract of a
sheep's adrenal gland.

39:40.942 --> 39:44.412
Jacob was right.

39:44.445 --> 39:46.447
You gave him adrenaline?

39:49.684 --> 39:52.665
You gave it Lillian too, didn't you?

39:52.687 --> 39:53.859
You killed Lillian.

39:53.888 --> 39:55.094
I did not.

39:55.123 --> 39:56.693
Jacob administered the adrenaline.

39:56.724 --> 39:58.032
But you knew,

39:58.059 --> 40:01.165
and you let me shoulder
the burden of her death.

40:01.396 --> 40:03.842
You and Jacob killed Lillian.

40:05.666 --> 40:08.408
Dr. Grace.

40:08.436 --> 40:12.543
Assemble the rest of the Society
for Metaphysical Exploration.

40:18.846 --> 40:20.086
You're not needed here.

40:20.114 --> 40:24.529
Always willing to help out
a fellow officer of the law.

40:24.552 --> 40:27.192
I never did get your name, Constable.

40:27.422 --> 40:28.924
I never gave it.

40:31.192 --> 40:32.830
The next one goes right through you,

40:32.860 --> 40:34.806
Mr. Bloody Teetotaler.

40:40.435 --> 40:42.779
Two murders have occurred at this lodge.

40:42.804 --> 40:45.648
Two murders that are connected.

40:45.673 --> 40:47.914
What are you talking about?

40:47.942 --> 40:50.218
Lillian MacDonald died a year ago.

40:50.445 --> 40:52.584
She died of an overdose of adrenaline.

40:52.613 --> 40:54.889
Russell, is this true?

40:56.617 --> 40:58.528
It was Lillian's idea.

40:58.553 --> 40:59.861
But is it true?

40:59.887 --> 41:01.798
They were all involved-

41:01.823 --> 41:04.463
Russell, Jacob, and Lillian.

41:04.492 --> 41:06.995
No! I don't believe it.

41:07.028 --> 41:10.066
Lillian would never have taken such a risk.

41:10.097 --> 41:11.906
She would never have abandoned me.

41:11.933 --> 41:14.573
Well, maybe you didn't know
her as well as you think.

41:14.602 --> 41:16.741
I knew her best.

41:16.771 --> 41:18.478
I loved her best.

41:18.506 --> 41:21.817
Miss Beaumont, may we
have a word in private?

41:21.843 --> 41:24.187
What you say to Hannah,
you say to all of us.

41:28.616 --> 41:30.562
Very well.

41:30.585 --> 41:34.260
Miss Beaumont, you killed Jacob Oliver.

41:35.923 --> 41:37.960
You loosened the light bulb of one lamp

41:37.992 --> 41:40.233
and rigged the second with Fanny's hairpin

41:40.261 --> 41:41.763
to blow the circuit.

41:49.504 --> 41:51.142
You knew the first lamp wouldn't work...

41:51.172 --> 41:52.583
Yes, Mr. MacDonald.

41:52.607 --> 41:55.087
So you waited for Fanny
to walk to the second lamp.

41:55.109 --> 41:57.020
You then feigned your exit...

41:57.044 --> 41:58.751
I'll fetch an oil lamp.

41:58.779 --> 42:02.693
Timed perfectly with
Fanny pulling the switch.

42:02.717 --> 42:04.253
But you didn't leave the room.

42:04.285 --> 42:05.958
You stepped back into the darkness

42:05.987 --> 42:08.900
and stood right behind Mr. Chisholm.

42:08.923 --> 42:10.561
You then kicked over the ash stand

42:10.591 --> 42:13.003
to mask the sound of the holdout's release.

42:14.695 --> 42:15.867
You then left the room...

42:15.897 --> 42:19.140
Hurry up, Hannah. It's
dark as Hades in here.

42:23.104 --> 42:26.085
Returning moments later with the oil lamp.

42:27.975 --> 42:29.682
Oh, Jacob!

42:31.546 --> 42:33.856
And in the end, the person
that killed Jacob Oliver

42:33.881 --> 42:36.885
was the person with the perfect alibi.

42:36.918 --> 42:39.558
Where is the evidence?

42:41.989 --> 42:44.902
Miss Beaumont,

42:44.926 --> 42:46.803
is this your sculpting tool?

42:49.597 --> 42:52.009
I suppose it must be.

42:52.033 --> 42:55.276
How is it came to be broken?

42:55.303 --> 42:57.977
I work with difficult materials.

42:58.005 --> 42:59.780
Oh, I see.

42:59.807 --> 43:02.083
Well, then, perhaps you can tell me,

43:02.109 --> 43:06.888
how is the broken piece ended
up in Jacob Oliver's throat?

43:11.986 --> 43:14.227
He used my precious girl

43:14.255 --> 43:17.668
to further his quest for scientific glory.

43:17.692 --> 43:20.696
Lillian wanted us to take her
right to the edge of death.

43:20.728 --> 43:23.038
But you should have looked after her.

43:23.064 --> 43:25.169
You shouldn't have gambled with her life.

43:25.199 --> 43:27.736
The two of you killed her.

43:27.768 --> 43:29.975
Detective, arrest this man.

43:30.905 --> 43:33.886
I'm afraid I cannot.

43:33.908 --> 43:38.857
Lillian MacDonald's death
must be ruled an accident.

43:38.879 --> 43:41.917
I will not accept that.

43:41.949 --> 43:46.159
Mr. Chisholm and Mr. Oliver's
actions were irresponsible...

43:47.989 --> 43:49.832
but not illegal.

43:49.857 --> 43:52.394
Your actions, however, were,

43:52.627 --> 43:54.265
and I'm afraid I have
to place you under arrest

43:54.295 --> 43:56.639
for the murder of Jacob Oliver.

44:11.746 --> 44:14.693
You caught Randolph Means? The Razor?

44:14.715 --> 44:16.661
Indeed, sir, with the inspector's help.

44:16.684 --> 44:18.721
Oh, good of you to mention it, Crabtree.

44:18.753 --> 44:20.699
When Watts was transferred here,

44:20.721 --> 44:21.961
the Razor got wind of it.

44:21.989 --> 44:23.696
He commandeered a police wagon.

44:23.724 --> 44:25.328
He placed an accomplice
here in the station.

44:25.359 --> 44:28.363
Then, sir, he disguised himself
as an officer of the law.

44:28.396 --> 44:31.900
Well, the Razor's a rather
elusive fellow, George.

44:31.932 --> 44:33.104
How did you spot him?

44:33.134 --> 44:36.047
The shoes, sir. Hardly police issue.

44:36.070 --> 44:38.380
The shoes? Very good, George.

44:38.406 --> 44:41.012
You see, by paying attention
to the smallest detail-

44:41.042 --> 44:43.386
Oh, here we go.

44:43.411 --> 44:45.413
- What's so amusing?
- Oh, nothing, sir.

44:45.446 --> 44:46.982
Fancy another drink, Crabtree?

44:47.014 --> 44:48.925
- Well earned.
- Certainly, sir.

44:50.818 --> 44:52.229
So, Murdoch,

44:52.253 --> 44:54.859
I believe our jail cells
have a new occupant.

44:54.889 --> 44:56.835
Caught yourself a murderer as well.

44:56.857 --> 44:58.234
I did, sir.

44:58.259 --> 45:00.364
Did you pick up on some small detail

45:00.394 --> 45:02.840
someone missed?

45:06.067 --> 45:07.205
No, sir.

45:07.234 --> 45:09.009
Finding the crucial detail was the result

45:09.036 --> 45:12.745
of a rather unusual occurrence...

45:12.773 --> 45:14.946
outside of my body, if you will.

45:16.877 --> 45:18.413
Go home, Murdoch.

45:18.446 --> 45:20.050
Get some rest.

45:21.148 --> 45:23.321
Yes, sir.

45:41.102 --> 45:45.414
"As the life ebbed out of me,
I seemed to drift away from...

45:45.439 --> 45:47.214
"and I could see my body...

45:47.241 --> 45:50.950
"No fear as I moved away from
Dr. Grace and Dr. Chisholm.

45:50.978 --> 45:53.390
"I felt a heightened feeling of awareness,

45:53.414 --> 45:56.952
an intensity I had never experienced."

46:07.461 --> 46:08.872
Dr. Grace.

46:10.898 --> 46:12.935
What did you see...

46:12.967 --> 46:13.968
when you died?

46:16.370 --> 46:18.407
Please.

46:18.439 --> 46:20.783
What did you see?

46:26.413 --> 46:27.824
Heaven.

46:28.482 --> 46:29.790
Truly?

46:30.417 --> 46:32.988
I saw heaven,

46:33.020 --> 46:35.091
or at least my imagining of it.

46:36.123 --> 46:37.864
How was it?

46:39.226 --> 46:41.228
It was wonderful.
