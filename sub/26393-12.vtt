WEBVTT

00:02.785 --> 00:05.135
Come on, Tina,
we got to get to this theater.

00:05.179 --> 00:07.311
Look, matinee hours
end in 30 minutes,

00:07.355 --> 00:08.921
and I'm not paying
full price

00:08.965 --> 00:12.490
to see The Rock
beat up a hurricane.

00:12.534 --> 00:14.840
Baby, we're only late
because you made us stop

00:14.884 --> 00:16.842
and try every free sample
in the store.

00:16.886 --> 00:19.584
How many weenies on a toothpick
can one man eat?

00:19.628 --> 00:22.892
Well, at least we don't have to
stand in line for popcorn.

00:22.935 --> 00:25.634
I saved us time and money.

00:25.677 --> 00:29.333
Look, we'll just find a birthday
present for Grover and go.

00:29.377 --> 00:31.509
[laughs]:
Oh!

00:31.553 --> 00:33.163
How about these nunchucks?

00:33.207 --> 00:34.904
[shouting]

00:38.038 --> 00:40.083
Oh, you know he's gonna
hit Dave with these.

00:42.085 --> 00:43.956
Put them back,
Bruce Leroy.

00:45.871 --> 00:48.091
Gemma doesn't want us
to get him any violent toys.

00:48.135 --> 00:52.182
Fine. Well,
I'm-a get them for me.

00:52.226 --> 00:53.792
Oh, what about this?

00:53.836 --> 00:55.794
No. Gemma asked us

00:55.838 --> 00:59.363
to shy away from any toys
that reinforce specific genders.

00:59.407 --> 01:03.324
Well, God forbid Grover
finds out he's a boy.

01:03.367 --> 01:06.718
How about we just cruise
over to the food section

01:06.762 --> 01:09.286
and get him a can of soup?[chuckles]

01:09.330 --> 01:12.550
Gemma suggested that we get him
something educational.

01:12.594 --> 01:14.596
Well, we can get him
some alphabet soup.

01:14.639 --> 01:17.686
Ooh, this is nice.

01:17.729 --> 01:18.861
A math puzzle.

01:18.904 --> 01:20.645
Seriously?

01:20.689 --> 01:23.692
What did that boy
ever do to you?

01:23.735 --> 01:26.651
You know what? I-I really can't
believe how these parents coddle

01:26.695 --> 01:28.523
their kids nowadays.Mm.

01:28.566 --> 01:31.874
We gave Malcolm and Marty plenty
of violent, gendered toys

01:31.917 --> 01:33.702
and they turned out fine.

01:33.745 --> 01:35.486
[laughter, shouting]

01:35.530 --> 01:37.184
Come on, you're dead, man!
I knocked your head off.

01:37.227 --> 01:38.576
No, you missed.
You hit that old lady!

01:38.620 --> 01:40.056
[both grunting]

01:43.059 --> 01:45.583
You know what? I'm gonna
let you deal with this.

01:45.627 --> 01:47.411
I'm gonna go back and get
some more toothpick weenies.

01:49.326 --> 01:50.980
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

01:51.023 --> 01:51.981
♪ Welcome to the hood.

01:58.553 --> 02:00.511
Okay, the backyard
is looking good,

02:00.555 --> 02:02.644
and the entertainment should
be here in half an hour.

02:02.687 --> 02:05.429
Oh, there's entertainment?Oh, yeah.

02:05.473 --> 02:09.825
We got the one and only
Insane Shane the Party Ma-chane.

02:09.868 --> 02:13.350
You got Insane Shane?

02:13.394 --> 02:14.917
You've heard of him?No.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.441
[chuckles]

02:17.485 --> 02:20.488
He's the premier host of kids'
birthday parties in Pasadena.

02:20.531 --> 02:22.490
Well, what makes
him so special?

02:22.533 --> 02:25.101
Kids love him.
He plays games, he juggles,

02:25.145 --> 02:28.017
he can do the happy birthday
song in armpit farts.

02:28.060 --> 02:30.585
Ah, well, Calvin's
birthday is coming up.

02:30.628 --> 02:31.934
I'll keep him in mind.

02:31.977 --> 02:33.631
[laughs]

02:33.675 --> 02:35.416
You almost done
with those cupcakes?

02:35.459 --> 02:37.069
Oh, I'm getting there,
but I can't believe

02:37.113 --> 02:39.028
you bought so many.

02:39.071 --> 02:40.638
Well, I don't know
any of the kids' allergies,

02:40.682 --> 02:42.858
so I got sugar-free,
gluten-free, peanut-free,

02:42.901 --> 02:45.121
vegan, and
vegan-gluten-peanut-sugar free.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.692
And taste-free, too.

02:50.735 --> 02:52.650
I know, but I don't care.

02:52.694 --> 02:54.130
I want to play
pin the tail on the donkey,

02:54.174 --> 02:56.001
not jab the kid with the EpiPen.

02:56.045 --> 02:57.351
[chuckles]

02:57.394 --> 02:58.569
What up, what up?

02:58.613 --> 02:59.614
Hey.[gasps]

02:59.657 --> 03:00.789
All right, guys.
We got the balloons.

03:00.832 --> 03:01.920
Oh, thank you, guys.

03:01.964 --> 03:04.401
[high-pitched]:
No problem.

03:04.445 --> 03:05.794
Yeah, there was a leaky one.

03:05.837 --> 03:09.319
Yeah, I didn't want to waste it.[chuckles]

03:09.363 --> 03:12.540
Gemma, disaster.
Insane Shane just cancelled.

03:12.583 --> 03:13.715
What?

03:13.758 --> 03:15.238
Yeah, apparently, he sneezed

03:15.282 --> 03:17.632
while he was
juggling bowling balls.

03:17.675 --> 03:20.591
Now he's in the hospital
with three concussions.

03:22.637 --> 03:23.812
Insane Shane cancelled?

03:23.855 --> 03:25.117
But I told everybody

03:25.161 --> 03:27.119
at school he was gonna be here.

03:27.163 --> 03:28.947
That's why they're coming.

03:28.991 --> 03:31.123
No, no, buddy, they...

03:31.167 --> 03:32.734
The kids are coming
to celebrate you.

03:32.777 --> 03:34.126
That's what this is all about,

03:34.170 --> 03:36.738
how awesome and cool you are.

03:36.781 --> 03:39.044
Mm, they said
they were coming for Shane.

03:41.308 --> 03:43.048
Hey, you know what, Grover?
Malcolm and I can play

03:43.092 --> 03:44.267
party games with you guys.

03:44.311 --> 03:45.790
Can you be insane?

03:45.834 --> 03:47.139
Totally insane.

03:47.183 --> 03:49.054
[chuckles]

03:49.098 --> 03:52.536
Mm, I don't know.

03:52.580 --> 03:54.451
[high-pitched]:
We're the only option you have.

03:56.323 --> 03:58.325
[shouting, cheering]

03:58.368 --> 04:00.196
Finish him!
Now, go!

04:00.240 --> 04:02.067
Go! Go!
Finish him!
Steady yourself!

04:02.111 --> 04:03.808
Go!
Go![thudding]

04:03.852 --> 04:06.202
Oh!
Oh, yes!

04:06.246 --> 04:09.336
And just like that,
Colby trips on a sprinkler.

04:09.379 --> 04:12.556
Oh, b-but he is up again,
and running faster than ever.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.341
In the wrong direction.

04:14.384 --> 04:16.343
But here comes Haley
for Team Malcolm.

04:16.386 --> 04:19.955
And Team Malcolm wins. Yes!

04:19.998 --> 04:22.174
In your face!
[laughs]

04:22.218 --> 04:25.352
Dude, what are you doing?

04:25.395 --> 04:26.831
We're just playing party games
with the kids.

04:26.875 --> 04:29.269
Oh, you're just saying that
because I won again.

04:29.312 --> 04:30.531
I came out of Mama first,

04:30.574 --> 04:32.228
and I haven't given up
that lead since.

04:32.272 --> 04:35.753
Seriously?
I am an engineer.

04:35.797 --> 04:37.668
I have a great job,
and my own apartment.

04:37.712 --> 04:39.540
You are unemployed,
and you live at home

04:39.583 --> 04:42.064
with your mama
and your daddy.

04:42.107 --> 04:44.501
Yes, but who just won
the egg toss?

04:46.547 --> 04:47.983
You have never beaten me
at anything physical,

04:48.026 --> 04:49.376
and you never will.

04:49.419 --> 04:51.029
[scoffs]
Do you think that bothers me?

04:51.073 --> 04:52.204
I think that kills you.

04:52.248 --> 04:54.119
Damn it, you're right. Kids,

04:54.163 --> 04:57.079
help me get Colby
out of those tomato vines.

04:57.122 --> 04:59.037
Hey, everybody.

04:59.081 --> 05:00.604
Hey.
Hey.
Oh, hey, Calvin.

05:00.648 --> 05:02.998
Hey, baby, where you been?

05:03.041 --> 05:05.914
Oh, I was just wrapping the
birthday gift I got for Grover.

05:05.957 --> 05:08.351
Oh, but we already got him
the math puzzle.

05:08.395 --> 05:11.789
Yeah, you know, I scratched
my name off that card.

05:11.833 --> 05:12.790
That's all you now.

05:14.139 --> 05:17.534
Oh, don't mind if I do.

05:17.578 --> 05:19.275
Ha, ha.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.842
What the hell?

05:22.974 --> 05:24.585
Okay, stop playing.
Where are the real cupcakes?

05:28.153 --> 05:31.069
Yay. Flash cards.

05:32.419 --> 05:35.596
Oh, what a great gift.

05:35.639 --> 05:36.988
Now, don't let me
catch you playing with those

05:37.032 --> 05:38.468
after bedtime.[chuckles]

05:38.512 --> 05:39.904
I don't think you're
gonna catch him

05:39.948 --> 05:41.253
playing with those
at any time.

05:43.430 --> 05:45.432
Sweetie, tell Colby
how much you like it.

05:45.475 --> 05:47.390
I thought I wasn't
supposed to lie.

05:47.434 --> 05:50.524
Grover.

05:50.567 --> 05:52.047
It's okay, I get it.

05:54.136 --> 05:58.662
Ring toss, three-legged race,
pin the tail on the donkey.

05:58.706 --> 06:00.185
Yo, man, what
are you doing?

06:00.229 --> 06:03.232
I'm just recapping my wins.

06:03.275 --> 06:05.452
Okay, okay. Well,
in that case, uh,

06:05.495 --> 06:10.065
bank account, credit
score, uh, life.

06:10.108 --> 06:12.459
Those are all
very good points.

06:12.502 --> 06:14.025
Yes.
[laughs]

06:14.069 --> 06:15.418
Don't none of them
matter right now, do they?

06:15.462 --> 06:16.463
No!

06:18.203 --> 06:21.163
Great, another math puzzle.

06:21.206 --> 06:24.079
Grover, thank Miss Tina.

06:24.122 --> 06:25.907
Thanks, Miss Tina.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.387
[quietly]:
Your mother made me get it.

06:29.127 --> 06:31.303
Well, okay, it looks like
we opened up all the gifts.

06:31.347 --> 06:33.088
Oh, oh, oh. Not yet.

06:33.131 --> 06:34.872
There's one more.Aw.

06:34.916 --> 06:36.831
There you go. My man.

06:36.874 --> 06:39.094
Cool!

06:39.137 --> 06:42.271
A knife.

06:42.314 --> 06:44.795
A knife?[laughs]: Whoa! A knife.

06:44.839 --> 06:46.884
Yeah, a knife. Here,
hold that next to your face

06:46.928 --> 06:47.972
so I can take a picture.

06:48.016 --> 06:49.626
TINA:
Oh, my God.

06:49.670 --> 06:53.108
Yeah.
[laughs] Yeah.

06:53.151 --> 06:56.328
[high-pitched]:
Holler at your boy!

07:05.207 --> 07:07.514
Can I touch it?Yeah.

07:07.557 --> 07:11.561
But you got me the flash cards,
so you're last.

07:11.605 --> 07:13.998
Calvin, what is the matter with
you, getting Grover a knife?

07:14.042 --> 07:15.957
What, were they
all out of nail guns?

07:17.393 --> 07:19.439
Give me some credit, Tina.

07:19.482 --> 07:21.136
The kickback on
one of those things

07:21.179 --> 07:24.269
would knock that
boy off his feet.

07:24.313 --> 07:26.707
Okay, you know what?
Everyone, back away.Yeah. Yeah.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.926
It's my turn to touch it.

07:28.970 --> 07:31.799
Yep. All right, why don't we
put away all the lovely gifts,

07:31.842 --> 07:32.800
and the knife,

07:32.843 --> 07:34.279
and, uh, get back

07:34.323 --> 07:36.368
to the fun games
with Malcolm and Marty?

07:36.412 --> 07:38.370
But everyone wants
to play with it.

07:38.414 --> 07:39.937
I know, that's why
it's going away.

07:39.981 --> 07:42.113
Guys, could you take
all the kids outside?

07:42.157 --> 07:43.375
All right, kids, let's go.All right, let's go.

07:43.419 --> 07:44.507
Let's go, let's go.Let's go.

07:44.551 --> 07:47.031
Dave, kitchen, now.

07:47.075 --> 07:48.946
Ooh.

07:48.990 --> 07:52.994
Dave, trouble, in.

07:54.386 --> 07:56.563
Calvin, cupcake, find.

08:02.612 --> 08:04.571
How could Calvin
give our son a knife

08:04.614 --> 08:06.747
without talking to us first?

08:06.790 --> 08:08.792
I know. He probably knew

08:08.836 --> 08:11.186
that I couldn't keep
something that cool a secret.

08:11.229 --> 08:15.495
How are you not more upset about
this? He gave our son a weapon.

08:15.538 --> 08:18.410
It's not a weapon,
it's-it's a pocketknife.

08:18.454 --> 08:20.848
It's a handheld
stabbing machine.

08:20.891 --> 08:24.416
Yeah, but if they call it that,
they're not gonna sell any.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.680
Oh...Okay, look,

08:26.723 --> 08:30.205
I know you just want
Grover to be safe.

08:30.248 --> 08:33.469
So do I, but, you know,
it's not that big a deal.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.602
When I was his age,
I had a BB gun.

08:35.645 --> 08:37.429
Yeah, and you still have
a BB in your arm

08:37.473 --> 08:39.606
from when your friend
shot you with it.

08:39.649 --> 08:41.433
Actually,
it's not there anymore.

08:41.477 --> 08:43.566
It just, it disappeared
for a year,

08:43.610 --> 08:45.220
and then it resurfaced
in my leg.

08:47.570 --> 08:48.745
We'll talk about this later.

08:48.789 --> 08:50.181
Right now,
this is going in the same drawer

08:50.225 --> 08:52.053
as your fedora
and your laser pointer.

08:52.096 --> 08:55.360
What-- you said that
my laser pointer was stolen.

08:57.101 --> 08:59.843
Can I have the
knife back?

08:59.887 --> 09:01.976
The other kids are
ignoring me without it.

09:02.019 --> 09:03.978
Oh, honey,
they're not ignoring you.

09:04.021 --> 09:05.980
Yeah, they probably think
the party is just less fun

09:06.023 --> 09:07.503
now that the knife is gone.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.418
Gemma,

09:09.461 --> 09:11.463
I-I know you think
it's dangerous,

09:11.507 --> 09:14.249
but the knife is
actually pretty cool.

09:14.292 --> 09:17.513
And isn't that exactly what
you wanted for Grover's party?

09:17.557 --> 09:20.037
Well, yeah, but...Okay. Well, then,

09:20.081 --> 09:22.562
how about this: how about
I'll take the knife outside,

09:22.605 --> 09:24.128
and I will show it to the kids?

09:24.172 --> 09:25.477
I will hold it

09:25.521 --> 09:28.524
the whole time, I promise.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.048
In fact, you know what?
I won't even open it.

09:31.092 --> 09:33.616
Please, Mom? It's my birthday.

09:33.660 --> 09:36.097
Fine.

09:36.140 --> 09:39.187
BOTH:
Yeah!

09:39.230 --> 09:40.449
Ooh, and, uh, my laser pointer?

09:40.492 --> 09:42.669
It's in heaven now.

09:42.712 --> 09:44.540
[straining]

09:44.584 --> 09:46.324
Come on, Team Marty!

09:46.368 --> 09:48.326
This isn't about
fun and games anymore.

09:48.370 --> 09:51.373
Then why are we doing it?

09:51.416 --> 09:53.897
So Marty doesn't cry
himself to sleep tonight.

09:53.941 --> 09:57.074
[laughter]Hey! Hey! I don't
do that anymore.

09:57.118 --> 10:00.251
Stop laughing!
You're on my team.

10:00.295 --> 10:01.818
Here come the waterworks.

10:03.124 --> 10:05.648
We got the knife!

10:05.692 --> 10:07.128
[cheering]

10:07.171 --> 10:08.912
BOTH:
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:08.956 --> 10:11.872
Oh... Uh-huh.
Oh... Whoo!

10:11.915 --> 10:13.395
And then there were two.

10:13.438 --> 10:15.049
Oh, I see you've been
working on your math.

10:15.092 --> 10:16.790
[chuckles]

10:16.833 --> 10:18.966
I see you haven't been
working on your arms.

10:19.009 --> 10:21.621
Okay, so it's like that?

10:21.664 --> 10:24.145
[strains]: Yeah.Yeah, well, I could
do this all day.

10:24.188 --> 10:25.755
I don't have to go
to work until Monday.

10:25.799 --> 10:28.453
Oh, yeah? Joke's on you.
I don't have a job.

10:30.194 --> 10:31.718
Now,

10:31.761 --> 10:33.676
I know most of you think
that the blade

10:33.720 --> 10:35.547
is the coolest part
of the knife,

10:35.591 --> 10:38.115
but have you ever
stopped to take a look

10:38.159 --> 10:40.596
at the bolster?
Take a look at that.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.554
Dave?

10:42.598 --> 10:44.600
What the heck
are you doing?

10:44.644 --> 10:46.733
Leave it up to you
to make a knife boring.

10:46.776 --> 10:49.083
Open it up.

10:49.126 --> 10:51.563
I can't. I promised Gemma.

10:51.607 --> 10:53.391
Dave, come on.
[laughs]

10:53.435 --> 10:55.655
These kids are starving
for something fun.

10:55.698 --> 10:57.874
My mom says fun is dangerous.

11:00.181 --> 11:02.139
Well, your mom thinks
flash cards are a great gift.

11:02.183 --> 11:03.663
[blows raspberry]

11:03.706 --> 11:06.883
Now, who wants to have fun?

11:06.927 --> 11:08.450
[cheering, screaming]

11:08.493 --> 11:09.930
O-Okay, all right.

11:09.973 --> 11:11.888
Okay, fine,
I will open it.

11:11.932 --> 11:14.848
But only so I can teach
you guys proper knife safety.

11:14.891 --> 11:18.808
I'm kind of an expert
since I was an Eagle Scout.

11:18.852 --> 11:19.853
What's that?

11:19.896 --> 11:21.593
What's an Eagle Scout?

11:21.637 --> 11:25.728
[laughs] Well, it's like
one step below a Navy SEAL.

11:25.772 --> 11:26.947
Dave,

11:26.990 --> 11:28.818
you're barely one step
above a real seal.

11:31.299 --> 11:33.649
Okay, okay.
All right.

11:35.738 --> 11:38.132
Now, there are a few things

11:38.175 --> 11:40.656
that you should always do
when handling a knife.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.179
You should always make sure

11:42.223 --> 11:44.312
that there is no one
within arm's reach.

11:44.355 --> 11:47.358
Okay?

11:47.402 --> 11:49.926
And you should
always make sure

11:49.970 --> 11:53.582
that you are cutting away
from yourself, like so.

11:55.497 --> 11:57.847
CALVIN:
Okay, all right.

11:57.891 --> 12:01.590
Okay, those are a few
of the boring things

12:01.633 --> 12:03.331
you should always do.

12:03.374 --> 12:05.463
Now let me show you a few

12:05.507 --> 12:07.988
cool things
that you should never do.

12:08.031 --> 12:09.685
Okay, okay,
all right.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.035
Kids, kids.All right? With a knife.

12:12.079 --> 12:15.560
All right? Never...

12:15.604 --> 12:16.953
hold a knife like this.

12:16.997 --> 12:19.216
ALL:
Ooh!

12:19.260 --> 12:21.784
Unless
there's a zombie apocalypse,

12:21.828 --> 12:23.786
and you got to do
what you got to do.

12:23.830 --> 12:27.094
Look here. Zombie! Zombie,
zombie, zombie, zombie![kids shouting]

12:27.137 --> 12:29.966
Calvin! Cal-Calvin,
that's enough.

12:30.010 --> 12:31.794
Never go hand to hand.

12:31.838 --> 12:34.101
Don't want to do that.

12:34.144 --> 12:37.191
Unless there are zombies
on both sides.

12:37.234 --> 12:39.062
Left zombie dead!

12:39.106 --> 12:40.629
[kids cheering]Right zombie dead! Yeah!

12:40.672 --> 12:43.110
Cal-Cal. Okay, Calvin,
that's good. We...

12:43.153 --> 12:46.200
Lis-Listen, kids, and never,
ever, ever, ever

12:46.243 --> 12:48.985
hold a knife by the blade...

12:49.029 --> 12:52.728
unless... you're gonna throw it
at the king zombie.

12:55.644 --> 12:58.516
ALL:
Oh!

12:58.560 --> 13:00.344
Calvin! That...

13:02.477 --> 13:03.434
...was awesome!

13:03.478 --> 13:07.177
[kids cheering]

13:07.221 --> 13:09.571
Gemma, I'm so sorry
about Calvin.

13:09.614 --> 13:11.486
He should never have given
Grover that knife

13:11.529 --> 13:13.140
without asking you guys first.

13:13.183 --> 13:15.098
Funny, that's exactly
what I was gonna write

13:15.142 --> 13:16.621
on the thank-you card.

13:16.665 --> 13:18.885
[chuckles]

13:18.928 --> 13:21.365
What is it with boys
and dangerous things?

13:21.409 --> 13:23.367
You know, scientific studies
have been done

13:23.411 --> 13:25.979
on this very subject,
and they always come back

13:26.022 --> 13:28.808
with the same conclusion:
boys are stupid.

13:31.158 --> 13:34.378
Maybe for Christmas,
I should just get Grover

13:34.422 --> 13:36.641
this box of matches
and a can of lighter fluid.

13:36.685 --> 13:39.166
Oh, please.
He doesn't need those.

13:39.209 --> 13:42.125
Marty used to start fires
with his magnifying glass.

13:42.169 --> 13:43.735
Really?

13:43.779 --> 13:46.129
You know that's
our third garage out back?

13:47.652 --> 13:49.611
Look, my point is,

13:49.654 --> 13:51.656
no matter what you do,
boys will always

13:51.700 --> 13:54.224
find a way to make
everything dangerous.

13:54.268 --> 13:56.966
[scoffs] Well, when do they
finally grow out of it?

13:57.010 --> 13:59.969
Well, Calvin bought nunchucks
the other day, so, never.

14:00.013 --> 14:03.190
Great. That means
I'm gonna be worried

14:03.233 --> 14:04.800
for the rest of my life.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.280
Well, if it makes you feel
any better,

14:06.323 --> 14:08.064
they keep it interesting.

14:08.108 --> 14:11.459
You know, Malcolm once stuck
a fork in a light socket.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.288
What happened?

14:14.331 --> 14:15.637
We had to get a new fuse box.

14:17.944 --> 14:20.424
Oh, you mean to Malcolm.Yeah.

14:20.468 --> 14:21.599
He was fine
once his eyebrows grew back.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.734
Look, Gemma,

14:25.777 --> 14:28.041
if you want, I'll make
sure that Calvin takes

14:28.084 --> 14:29.694
that knife back right now.

14:29.738 --> 14:31.261
It's okay.
Dave promised

14:31.305 --> 14:32.610
they'd be careful with it.

14:35.352 --> 14:37.659
KIDS: Whoa!

14:40.880 --> 14:43.883
And that's how
you play pin-finger.

14:45.232 --> 14:47.060
Which you should never, ever do

14:47.103 --> 14:48.670
unless you're a pirate.

14:48.713 --> 14:49.453
Or me.

14:49.497 --> 14:51.542
Wow.

14:51.586 --> 14:54.241
[groans]I know what
you're thinking.

14:54.284 --> 14:55.938
You have no idea
what I'm thinking.

14:55.982 --> 14:59.246
"Use the force, Marty."

14:59.289 --> 15:01.509
Get out of my head, wizard!

15:01.552 --> 15:03.250
Oh, no.

15:03.293 --> 15:04.642
I live in your head.

15:04.686 --> 15:06.166
Oh, why-- did Mom and Dad

15:06.209 --> 15:07.210
finally start charging you rent?

15:09.038 --> 15:10.648
I knew you would say that.

15:10.692 --> 15:13.216
No, you didn't. Stop it!No, you didn't. Stop it!

15:13.260 --> 15:15.001
I'm not playin'!I'm not playin'!

15:15.044 --> 15:17.655
I'm not playin'!I'm not playin'!

15:17.699 --> 15:19.831
Do another trick!

15:19.875 --> 15:21.224
All right, I'll show you a
trick. Give me the knife.

15:21.268 --> 15:23.226
Really, seal boy?

15:23.270 --> 15:24.924
What are you gonna do--
balance it on your nose?

15:26.490 --> 15:29.102
Okay, now, don't tell your mom,

15:29.145 --> 15:30.364
but this is a little trick

15:30.407 --> 15:32.235
I used to wow 'em with
back in scout camp.

15:34.759 --> 15:36.936
KIDS:
Whoa!

15:36.979 --> 15:39.025
[laughs]

15:39.068 --> 15:41.027
It might be good
for scout camp,

15:41.070 --> 15:43.855
but what are you gonna do in
real life when zombies attack?

15:43.899 --> 15:46.467
Hmm?All right.

15:46.510 --> 15:47.468
Want to see me throw it higher?

15:47.511 --> 15:48.469
KIDS:
Yeah!

15:51.994 --> 15:54.823
KIDS:
Whoa!

15:54.866 --> 15:56.825
Your dad's cool, Grover.

15:56.868 --> 15:58.087
Oh, you think
that was cool?

15:58.131 --> 15:59.654
You better put
on your parka,

15:59.697 --> 16:02.178
because it's about to
get downright freezing.

16:02.222 --> 16:04.137
All right.

16:04.180 --> 16:06.269
Give me some room.

16:06.313 --> 16:07.967
Ready?

16:08.010 --> 16:10.317
♪ Happy birth...

16:10.360 --> 16:12.972
ALL:
Oh!

16:13.015 --> 16:15.191
Right through the shoe. Ooh.

16:15.235 --> 16:17.411
Oh, my God,
are you okay?

16:17.454 --> 16:19.021
Gemma, get
the car keys!Okay, okay.

16:19.065 --> 16:20.849
Okay.Get the car keys now.

16:21.937 --> 16:24.809
Uh, uh, guys, I...

16:24.853 --> 16:27.551
hope that is a valuable lesson
to all of you

16:27.595 --> 16:29.684
that you won't
tell your parents.

16:37.561 --> 16:39.781
So...

16:39.824 --> 16:41.087
fun party.

16:43.915 --> 16:46.135
Yeah, it was great.

16:46.179 --> 16:47.528
There was blood,
there was a knife.

16:47.571 --> 16:49.269
The only thing missing
was the crime scene tape.

16:51.227 --> 16:52.576
Okay, okay.
Look, I get it.

16:52.620 --> 16:54.578
You're mad.

16:54.622 --> 16:56.928
I never should have
given him the knife.

16:56.972 --> 17:00.149
You think?
He's only seven years old.

17:00.193 --> 17:02.064
Oh, I was talking
about Dave.

17:04.327 --> 17:06.416
Yeah...
I specifically asked

17:06.460 --> 17:09.071
that nobody get Grover a weapon,
and you got him one anyway.

17:09.115 --> 17:11.639
And a math puzzle.

17:11.682 --> 17:13.597
No matter what the card says,
that was from both of us.

17:14.990 --> 17:16.513
[clears throat]

17:16.557 --> 17:18.646
Look, Gemma.

17:18.689 --> 17:21.214
Look, I didn't mean
to disrespect you

17:21.257 --> 17:23.825
or anything like that.
I just remember

17:23.868 --> 17:26.436
when my grandfather
gave me my first knife.

17:26.480 --> 17:29.309
It made me...

17:29.352 --> 17:32.094
feel like a man, even though
I was a kid. And so

17:32.138 --> 17:34.836
I wanted Grover
to have that same feeling too.

17:34.879 --> 17:36.403
But he's not a man.

17:36.446 --> 17:38.231
He's a little boy.

17:39.710 --> 17:41.408
Look, I'm not naive.

17:41.451 --> 17:44.150
I know I can't keep him
in a bubble forever.

17:44.193 --> 17:46.543
But he's my baby,
and I want to protect him

17:46.587 --> 17:48.328
for as long as I can.

17:48.371 --> 17:51.374
You know what?
You're right.

17:51.418 --> 17:53.637
I guess I just
never looked at it like that.

17:53.681 --> 17:55.030
I'm sorry.

17:57.337 --> 18:00.296
It's okay.

18:00.340 --> 18:02.472
Your heart was
in the right place.

18:02.516 --> 18:04.344
Yeah.

18:04.387 --> 18:06.085
Besides, I have to admit,

18:06.128 --> 18:08.348
the knife was a huge hit.Hmm.

18:08.391 --> 18:10.654
Probably even bigger
than Insane Shane would've been.

18:12.569 --> 18:13.918
He's one floor up,
by the way.

18:16.486 --> 18:19.707
You know, Grover did
seem like he had fun.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.665
I know.

18:21.709 --> 18:23.667
I was so worried
about him making friends,

18:23.711 --> 18:25.539
but now all the kids
think he's cool.

18:25.582 --> 18:27.193
Well, of course.

18:27.236 --> 18:30.544
They saw a dude get stabbed
at his birthday party.

18:30.587 --> 18:33.329
Come Monday, he's
gonna be the man.

18:34.591 --> 18:36.289
Oh.Oh.

18:36.332 --> 18:38.160
There you are.
Are you okay?

18:38.204 --> 18:39.901
Well...

18:39.944 --> 18:41.729
they couldn't save the sock.

18:44.297 --> 18:46.255
But other than that,
I'm fine. Ooh, and look.

18:46.299 --> 18:48.605
They took out my BB.[clinking]

18:50.738 --> 18:53.784
I don't know whether to kiss you
or step on your foot.

18:53.828 --> 18:55.743
I know which one
would be more fun to watch.

18:55.786 --> 18:58.485
[chuckles]

18:58.528 --> 19:00.139
I'm sorry
we played with the knife.

19:00.182 --> 19:03.098
Yeah. Yeah, it was
a little childish.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.274
But the kids were egging us on.

19:05.318 --> 19:07.842
Yeah, and I totally
would have caught it

19:07.885 --> 19:09.583
if I wasn't distracted
by the cake.

19:09.626 --> 19:10.975
Throwing it
that high?

19:11.019 --> 19:12.934
Yeah, right.

19:12.977 --> 19:14.414
I'm sorry,
you-you don't think so?

19:14.457 --> 19:16.633
'Cause there's a scalpel
back in the room.

19:16.677 --> 19:19.375
Hey, you're talking.
I don't see you moving, though.Well, let's go, then.

19:19.419 --> 19:20.681
I don't care.Really, I mean, you're gonna do
what you're gonna do.

19:20.724 --> 19:21.943
Guys.I mean, you saw I was...

19:21.986 --> 19:26.208
Sorry. You're right.Yeah, my bad. Bad...

19:29.864 --> 19:31.474
Meet me in the back yard
tomorrow.

19:31.518 --> 19:33.433
I'll show you.

19:42.920 --> 19:46.097
Did you ask my parents if it's
okay to do this to our tree?

19:46.141 --> 19:48.230
No.

19:48.274 --> 19:51.233
That's why I'm carving
your name into it and not mine.

19:53.627 --> 19:56.107
So, how did your friends
like the party?

19:56.151 --> 19:57.805
Yeah, they loved it.

19:57.848 --> 19:59.720
I even got a bunch
of play date invites.

19:59.763 --> 20:01.330
Well, all right.

20:01.374 --> 20:03.550
You know what?

20:03.593 --> 20:07.597
I'm gonna hold onto this for you
until your mom says it's okay.

20:07.641 --> 20:09.773
But the knife
is what made me cool.

20:09.817 --> 20:10.861
Oh... [chuckles]

20:10.905 --> 20:13.124
trust me, Grover, you were cool

20:13.168 --> 20:15.388
way before this knife.

20:15.431 --> 20:17.172
You think?

20:17.216 --> 20:20.349
Definitely.
And that's coming from me,

20:20.393 --> 20:23.657
the coolest guy you know.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.615
Thanks, Mr. Calvin.

20:25.659 --> 20:27.617
Good night, little man.Good night.

20:27.661 --> 20:29.097
All right.

20:29.140 --> 20:30.490
[imitates explosion,
chuckles]

20:33.188 --> 20:35.538
All right, fellas,
finish up, now.

20:35.582 --> 20:37.018
Come on, your
mom made dinner.

20:37.061 --> 20:39.934
Oh, help me, Jesus.

20:39.977 --> 20:42.545
Face it, Marty--
you will never beat me.

20:42.589 --> 20:44.765
I can feel it.
Tonight is the night!

20:44.808 --> 20:46.114
Oh, no.

20:46.157 --> 20:47.420
You're fooling yourself.

20:47.463 --> 20:48.725
I'll always be bigger.[groans]

20:48.769 --> 20:50.379
I'll always be stronger,
I'll always be...

20:50.423 --> 20:52.642
Aah![thud]

20:55.471 --> 20:57.343
And I'll always be smarter.

20:57.386 --> 20:59.301
[laughs]
