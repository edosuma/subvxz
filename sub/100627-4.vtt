00:42.000 --> 00:46.583
BANK OF SPAIN
5 YEARS BEFORE D-DAY

00:49.958 --> 00:50.875
Hello.

01:24.625 --> 01:26.125
Good morning, miss.

01:26.333 --> 01:29.041
I have an appointment
with Mr. Mario Urbaneja,

01:29.208 --> 01:31.000
governor of the Bank of Spain.

01:33.875 --> 01:36.583
Alfredo Kesmann,
from Rating Trust Corporation.

01:45.458 --> 01:46.333
Take a seat.

01:50.125 --> 01:51.833
You're very kind. Thank you.

02:22.958 --> 02:25.291
-Excuse me, where are you going?
-Hello.

02:26.125 --> 02:27.000
And you?

02:28.458 --> 02:32.041
-Have we met before?
-I'm asking you where you're going.

02:32.458 --> 02:34.166
I'm here to see the governor.

02:35.416 --> 02:39.250
Where are you going? For a walk?
It's a beautiful day.

02:39.958 --> 02:42.916
They'll have told you to wait there.
They'll come for you.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.791
No one was coming,
so I came up. I know the way.

02:45.875 --> 02:47.666
-Mr. Kesmann.
-That's me.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.666
-Nice to meet you.
-How are you?

02:49.750 --> 02:51.083
Sorry about the wait.

02:51.166 --> 02:53.250
-He'll be right with you.
-Great.

02:53.333 --> 02:54.958
-Come with me.
-Thank you.

02:55.958 --> 02:58.250
-Have a good day.
-I'll come with you.

02:59.750 --> 03:00.750
Please do.

03:23.500 --> 03:24.708
Rest, dear.

03:27.666 --> 03:28.666
You?

03:29.375 --> 03:31.375
I'm in charge of intensive care.

03:31.541 --> 03:33.708
Don't worry, I was a nurse.

03:34.250 --> 03:36.458
I'm going to the bathroom,
but I'll be here.

03:36.541 --> 03:37.750
Thank you.

03:44.541 --> 03:45.500
<i>Mutt.</i>

03:47.125 --> 03:49.333
I told you I was going to kill you.

04:53.875 --> 04:55.166
Which way did he go?

04:57.791 --> 04:59.500
Rio, which way did he go?

05:00.083 --> 05:01.291
For fuck's sake.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Where did he go?

05:04.750 --> 05:05.708
Up the stairs.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.750
Stockholm, Denver, stay here.

05:09.833 --> 05:13.583
Don't let him get near the door.
If the hostages escape, we're fucked.

05:13.666 --> 05:15.208
-Understood.
-Let's go.

05:15.375 --> 05:18.083
-Helsinki, Bogotá, come with me.
-Let's go.

05:19.458 --> 05:22.166
Everyone, stand the fuck up, now!

05:24.291 --> 05:25.500
What's happening?

05:26.833 --> 05:29.333
Nairobi. Something's wrong. Run!

05:29.416 --> 05:30.500
Nairobi!

05:51.166 --> 05:52.916
-Nairobi, hold on!
-Nairobi!

06:06.916 --> 06:08.958
Nairobi!

06:09.041 --> 06:10.375
Nairobi, hold on!

06:26.833 --> 06:29.333
He tried to smother her.
Her pulse was 162 bpm.

06:29.416 --> 06:30.916
-Nairobi.
-Nairobi.

06:31.333 --> 06:32.208
Easy.

06:32.625 --> 06:33.916
Easy, breathe.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.666
-Breathe, Nairobi.
-Gandía is on the loose.

06:39.708 --> 06:41.625
Bogotá!

06:42.666 --> 06:44.000
You stay with Nairobi.

06:44.583 --> 06:48.166
If he comes back in,
blow his brains out, understood?

06:48.833 --> 06:51.208
Helsinki, go after him.

06:52.333 --> 06:54.125
-Look after her.
-My friend...

07:07.250 --> 07:10.333
From now on, the rules have changed.
Nobody gets up,

07:10.625 --> 07:14.500
nobody moves, nobody eats
without direct fucking orders.

07:14.583 --> 07:16.208
You're fucked, Denver.

07:16.916 --> 07:18.375
Really fucked.

07:18.458 --> 07:20.833
-I don't believe it.
-Did you say something?

07:20.916 --> 07:21.750
Yes.

07:22.458 --> 07:24.500
You're not invincible anymore.

07:24.583 --> 07:26.291
No. You're not invincible.

07:26.375 --> 07:28.208
They're not invincible!

07:28.291 --> 07:29.625
Arturo, shut up!

07:30.000 --> 07:30.875
Or what?

07:30.958 --> 07:33.791
Or I'll empty the gun
into your fucking head.

07:33.875 --> 07:36.125
-Things have changed around here.
-Yes.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
We're here, and now <i>we're</i> the Resistance.

07:42.791 --> 07:46.041
Amanda, Miguel, we're the Resistance, hey?

07:46.875 --> 07:49.708
We're the Resistance. Resistance!

07:49.791 --> 07:52.458
Resistance!

07:53.041 --> 07:57.708
Resistance!

07:57.791 --> 08:01.166
Resistance!

08:07.791 --> 08:09.833
Resistance, my ass.

08:12.083 --> 08:14.666
Everyone, on the fucking ground now!

08:27.125 --> 08:28.500
That's right, Sergio.

08:28.833 --> 08:31.708
We need to know
how the bodyguards will react.

08:32.291 --> 08:33.625
How they react,

08:33.708 --> 08:36.583
how long they'll take
to get the governor to safety,

08:36.666 --> 08:38.166
how they'll spread out...

08:39.500 --> 08:42.500
-It's all in the protocols.
-We have the protocols,

08:42.666 --> 08:43.833
we have the theory,

08:44.166 --> 08:46.541
but we could do with a bit of practice.

08:48.041 --> 08:50.625
And how do you propose
we get that practice?

08:51.583 --> 08:55.500
By creating a minor security crisis
and watching it from inside.

08:57.500 --> 09:01.458
-You're going into the lion's den?
-And the lion will protect me.

09:08.875 --> 09:10.416
Who will you impersonate?

09:12.500 --> 09:14.541
They'll think he's a genius, a big name.

09:15.416 --> 09:17.041
A risk analyst

09:17.125 --> 09:18.958
from Rating Trust Corporation.

09:19.375 --> 09:23.958
Before that, he was at Bacher & Bacher,
and at Standard and Risk before that.

09:24.708 --> 09:29.500
We're going to steal the identity
of someone truly brilliant.

09:30.500 --> 09:34.791
A Spanish guy who has been living
in New York for more than 20 years.

09:35.291 --> 09:36.458
Alfredo Kesmann.

09:37.041 --> 09:38.333
A real genius.

09:38.791 --> 09:42.708
And we have a few great suggestions
for the country's economy.

09:42.791 --> 09:45.125
-The governor will appreciate them.
-Right.

09:57.708 --> 09:59.583
-May I sit down?
-Of course.

10:00.208 --> 10:03.166
But you could also
remain standing for the governor.

10:05.541 --> 10:09.083
-You're the governor's head of security?
-Affirmative.

10:21.333 --> 10:24.916
In a way, you and I do the same thing.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.625
We're both risk analysts.

10:29.041 --> 10:32.375
-We're very similar, don't you think?
<i>-</i>No.

10:33.083 --> 10:34.583
We're not at all alike.

10:35.708 --> 10:38.250
I analyze risks to save lives.

10:39.375 --> 10:40.791
You do it to make money.

10:42.708 --> 10:43.583
It's not the same.

10:45.250 --> 10:46.416
Yes, we're similar.

10:46.500 --> 10:50.208
What's more,
you're very clearheaded and... observant.

10:57.041 --> 11:00.708
What risks do you see
here and now in this office?

11:00.791 --> 11:02.125
Just out of curiosity.

11:02.208 --> 11:07.708
If I could see any risks in this room,
they would no longer exist.

11:08.708 --> 11:09.750
Don't you think?

11:13.083 --> 11:13.916
Mr. Kesmann.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.791
-Good morning.
-How are you?

11:15.875 --> 11:17.708
-Good, thank you.
-Shall we sit down?

11:17.791 --> 11:18.625
Let's.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.958
Would you like some coffee, sir?

11:21.333 --> 11:24.458
A Ceylon tea
with cardamom would be great.

11:24.541 --> 11:27.750
-If not, any black tea is fine. Thanks.
-Of course.

11:30.083 --> 11:32.458
If I had a coffee now, I would go crazy.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.875
You can start your statement. Go ahead.

11:46.666 --> 11:49.333
Before I start,
I'd like to clarify something.

11:51.250 --> 11:53.625
I don't know if it's important, but...

11:53.916 --> 11:57.333
I've been thinking,
and I wanted to ask you something.

11:58.041 --> 12:01.000
-Shoot.
-What's it like when you get home?

12:02.291 --> 12:05.583
I mean, you get home from work,

12:06.125 --> 12:09.000
after torturing a kid like Rio,

12:09.666 --> 12:12.333
who you've had standing up
for days and days

12:12.708 --> 12:15.125
in a cell that's smaller than a closet,

12:15.208 --> 12:16.916
shitting and pissing himself.

12:18.916 --> 12:21.125
And then you go back home, to Germán.

12:23.833 --> 12:24.833
I don't get it.

12:26.208 --> 12:28.958
<i>You</i> don't mind
being called a torturer in the press.

12:30.333 --> 12:31.375
But Germán...

12:34.416 --> 12:36.125
Germán is a good person.

12:37.041 --> 12:39.250
What does he say when you get home?

12:39.333 --> 12:42.250
Does he ask you,
"How was your day, darling?"

12:43.083 --> 12:44.250
And you kiss him...

12:46.125 --> 12:47.166
and you hug him.

12:47.708 --> 12:50.291
What about him?
Does he kiss and hug you back?

12:50.708 --> 12:51.583
Do you fuck?

12:53.291 --> 12:55.500
I think you must make him sick.

13:06.875 --> 13:11.000
The truth is, it has been two months
since Germán hugged me.

13:12.583 --> 13:15.541
He doesn't hug me, or kiss me,
or make love to me.

13:17.458 --> 13:19.500
Not since I had him cremated.

13:22.041 --> 13:26.916
They covered him with a white sheet
and took him down to the hospital morgue,

13:27.916 --> 13:30.166
and that's when the embraces stopped.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.750
What are you talking about?

13:44.291 --> 13:45.250
He's dead.

13:56.166 --> 13:57.041
Cancer...

13:58.708 --> 13:59.750
of the pancreas.

14:03.458 --> 14:07.166
The kind where they give you two months,
and it is two months.

14:11.083 --> 14:14.000
I put on weight, and he lost it.

14:15.708 --> 14:17.833
I was pink, and he was yellow.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
It consumed him.

14:25.041 --> 14:26.541
Life grew in me.

14:27.875 --> 14:29.083
Death grew in him.

14:32.666 --> 14:33.833
That's cancer.

14:36.208 --> 14:41.375
Do you know the last thing he said to me?
Can you believe his last words were...

14:44.750 --> 14:45.958
"Turn on the news?"

14:54.250 --> 14:57.250
I thought he was going to give me
one of those talks of his

14:57.333 --> 15:01.291
because, as you know,
he was quite eloquent and so imaginative.

15:01.541 --> 15:05.750
And he said, "Turn on the news."
He was high as a kite on morphine.

15:05.833 --> 15:08.125
So I guess he just lost it.

15:09.958 --> 15:11.041
Then he just died.

15:26.416 --> 15:27.500
I'm really sorry.

15:31.250 --> 15:34.833
-Alicia, let's go outside for a second.
-Yes, coming.

15:54.166 --> 15:57.958
Antoñanzas, stay and watch Murillo.
Don't let anyone in.

16:10.750 --> 16:13.958
For God's sake,
why didn't you say anything before?

16:15.458 --> 16:18.708
What would I have gained? A bit of pity?

16:20.416 --> 16:21.625
Oh, Alicia...

16:24.625 --> 16:28.250
I'm sorry, but I don't think
you're up to leading this case.

17:59.041 --> 18:00.333
I'll take this.

18:01.250 --> 18:02.458
This too.

18:02.541 --> 18:04.041
Easy.

18:04.125 --> 18:05.916
Try and die quietly.

18:16.958 --> 18:19.166
Helsinki!

18:21.458 --> 18:23.166
Hold on! Bogotá!

18:23.500 --> 18:26.375
<i>Bogotá, come to the library!</i>

18:26.875 --> 18:29.000
<i>Helsinki, hold on, please.</i>

18:29.083 --> 18:31.083
-<i>Hold on. Bogotá.</i>
-Go!

18:37.708 --> 18:39.541
Bogotá! Hold on, please.

18:40.375 --> 18:42.125
<i>The library, Bogotá!</i>

18:44.166 --> 18:46.166
Bogotá, quickly!

18:46.541 --> 18:47.375
Help me!

18:48.041 --> 18:50.250
Hold on, Helsinki.

18:50.666 --> 18:53.000
-Quick.
-Come on.

18:54.083 --> 18:56.000
Hold on. Come on!

18:56.583 --> 18:57.500
Hold on!

18:57.583 --> 18:59.375
Cut the rope!

18:59.458 --> 19:00.500
Hold on!

19:01.708 --> 19:05.041
Come on! Cut the rope, dammit!

19:05.791 --> 19:06.666
Hold on.

19:20.041 --> 19:22.625
Gandía!

19:22.708 --> 19:24.666
You son of a bitch!

19:25.916 --> 19:30.416
Silence, for fuck's sake!
I said, nobody talk! Nobody talk!

19:42.833 --> 19:43.958
Amanda.

19:44.958 --> 19:47.083
-How are you feeling?
-Better.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.833
-I feel a bit calmer now.
-Good.

19:52.291 --> 19:54.958
If you want,
we can go back with the others.

19:55.041 --> 19:57.833
There's no rush.
The main thing is for you to get well.

19:57.916 --> 20:00.041
-OK.
-Let me take your pulse.

20:02.333 --> 20:04.458
No, it's still really fast, Amanda.

20:04.541 --> 20:06.458
This is a major anxiety attack.

20:06.541 --> 20:09.000
Do you have fluttering in your chest?

20:09.083 --> 20:12.958
-Well, a little bit.
<i>-</i>That's normal. It's one of the symptoms.

20:14.083 --> 20:15.541
Luckily...

20:16.583 --> 20:18.125
I got something for you.

20:19.958 --> 20:20.833
Here.

20:20.916 --> 20:22.250
This works wonders.

20:22.833 --> 20:24.250
Take three.

20:24.458 --> 20:28.416
-It's not too strong, is it?
-No. A bit stronger than valerian.

20:28.500 --> 20:31.583
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure. I've taken four.

20:33.250 --> 20:34.416
-OK.
-Go ahead.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.083
One at a time.

20:38.333 --> 20:39.500
-Thanks.
-It's OK.

20:44.416 --> 20:47.333
Everyone, listen up, please.

20:49.000 --> 20:49.875
Let's see.

20:50.958 --> 20:55.333
Many of you didn't know my husband,

20:56.583 --> 20:57.541
Germán.

20:58.583 --> 21:01.000
But the colonel thinks this concerns you:

21:03.083 --> 21:04.083
he's passed away.

21:08.250 --> 21:12.333
Tamayo thinks I'm not up to this task.

21:14.500 --> 21:17.708
But the truth is,
there's no one better than me for this.

21:17.791 --> 21:19.458
No one.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.208
Because I don't fucking want to go home.
Or open the fridge.

21:29.291 --> 21:30.291
Or the mailbox...

21:31.000 --> 21:32.458
in case I see his name.

21:33.333 --> 21:34.875
Or the boxes of photos.

21:38.791 --> 21:41.291
So, I'm like fucking Deep Blue,

21:41.375 --> 21:45.041
calculating 200 million moves a minute
against the Professor.

21:47.833 --> 21:49.916
That's what this heist needs.

21:51.250 --> 21:52.833
And it's what I need.

21:55.750 --> 21:57.458
Anyone got anything to say?

21:59.166 --> 22:00.083
No?

22:00.333 --> 22:03.083
Then let's all cheer up a bit.
Back to work.

22:18.125 --> 22:18.958
Rio.

22:20.125 --> 22:21.958
Why the hell didn't you shoot?

22:23.916 --> 22:24.750
I don't know.

22:28.083 --> 22:29.166
I froze.

22:31.750 --> 22:35.458
<i>-And why did you freeze, Rio?</i>
<i>-Because I'm not a fucking killer.</i>

22:40.541 --> 22:42.458
You don't need to be a killer.

22:43.416 --> 22:47.125
I couldn't shoot him in the chest
and pretend nothing happened.

22:47.208 --> 22:48.291
Then shoot his leg!

22:48.375 --> 22:50.500
-I can't!
-Then shoot at the ceiling!

22:50.583 --> 22:53.625
Or the floor!
Wherever it takes to keep him still!

22:53.708 --> 22:56.208
I'm telling you, I couldn't. I froze!

22:59.750 --> 23:01.250
<i>He said he had a family.</i>

23:02.125 --> 23:05.166
He was unarmed. I couldn't.

23:08.125 --> 23:09.291
Why couldn't you?

23:11.500 --> 23:12.625
Tell us why.

23:15.250 --> 23:18.333
He couldn't, because he is traumatized.

23:18.416 --> 23:20.750
I told you, and you fucking ignored me.

23:20.833 --> 23:24.708
And now, because of you,
Helsinki and Nairobi were nearly killed.

23:24.791 --> 23:26.125
Denver, enough!

23:27.416 --> 23:28.666
Rio raised the alarm.

23:28.750 --> 23:31.333
Helsinki and Nairobi are alive.
That's what matters.

23:31.416 --> 23:33.333
<i>You know what matters more?</i>

23:34.291 --> 23:35.416
<i>How did he get free?</i>

23:36.833 --> 23:39.125
-You took Gandía to the bathroom.
-Yes.

23:39.208 --> 23:41.750
-Did you put the cuffs on right?
-Obviously.

23:41.833 --> 23:44.500
"Obviously."

23:44.583 --> 23:47.666
<i>Then obviously,</i>
<i>something doesn't fucking add up.</i>

23:47.750 --> 23:50.708
Tokyo, how does
a guy who is handcuffed escape?

23:51.708 --> 23:53.541
Any ideas, Nairobi?

23:54.041 --> 23:56.041
Any ideas? What?

23:56.583 --> 24:00.750
Nothing, right?
Something smells very fishy to me.

24:04.208 --> 24:05.666
Are you saying I'm a traitor?

24:05.750 --> 24:08.458
-I don't know. You tell me.
-No. <i>You </i>tell me.

24:09.750 --> 24:11.041
It's our fault.

24:13.583 --> 24:18.125
We shouldn't have left
the kid on guard with PTSD.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.416
Rio is no traitor.

24:22.083 --> 24:24.875
We have a more urgent problem.
Listen to me.

24:24.958 --> 24:28.083
The biggest risk is Gandía making contact
with the outside...

24:28.625 --> 24:32.208
<i>and them launching a coordinated attack,</i>
<i>from inside and outside.</i>

24:32.541 --> 24:34.000
What's the plan?

24:36.333 --> 24:37.541
He has to be killed.

24:40.500 --> 24:41.333
Who?

24:42.708 --> 24:43.541
That guy.

24:45.791 --> 24:47.166
We are not murderers.

24:47.250 --> 24:48.750
Then we'll be corpses.

24:48.833 --> 24:52.500
We'll get rid of the bodyguards
during the first hour.

24:53.041 --> 24:56.166
They'll be the ones
who leave with the state secrets.

24:57.583 --> 24:58.916
Problem solved.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.041
Get the fuck out!

25:01.125 --> 25:03.250
That bastard won't go out
with the secrets.

25:03.333 --> 25:04.666
Nobody move.

25:04.750 --> 25:06.291
He won't follow orders.

25:13.541 --> 25:14.500
And Santiago?

25:16.250 --> 25:19.166
-Did he get out after raising hell?
-Yes.

25:19.875 --> 25:23.416
-It looked like an accident.
-The blast was magnificent.

25:27.541 --> 25:30.833
I've brought my agency's
latest reports on country risk.

25:32.500 --> 25:36.291
But...
they don't come out until next month.

25:36.375 --> 25:39.666
We're still working on them,
but these are practically final.

25:40.791 --> 25:42.166
And not encouraging.

25:42.250 --> 25:45.000
They'll damage the risk premium
on your public debt.

25:45.083 --> 25:48.791
-Any suggestions?
-Officially, liquid assets in the bank,

25:49.416 --> 25:51.833
anti-inflationary measures, the usual.

25:52.750 --> 25:56.916
But if I may give you my opinion,
which won't appear in the report...

25:58.041 --> 25:58.875
Gold.

26:02.583 --> 26:05.666
-Excuse me?
-Increase your gold reserves.

26:05.750 --> 26:08.625
It's the only safe-haven asset.
And bring it here...

26:09.375 --> 26:11.125
to the vault in the Bank of Spain.

26:11.208 --> 26:13.583
Only that will support you in the market.

26:15.125 --> 26:16.083
Look...

26:16.833 --> 26:18.791
what happened in 2008 was a joke.

26:20.291 --> 26:22.041
The real debt crisis is coming.

26:25.666 --> 26:27.000
Are you telling me...

26:28.083 --> 26:31.833
to bet the entire national reserve...
on a single color?

26:32.541 --> 26:37.125
No, I'm telling you
to bet on the winning horse: gold.

26:42.500 --> 26:43.541
What's happening?

26:44.416 --> 26:47.125
-Don't worry.
-Was that an explosion?

26:47.208 --> 26:48.958
Security to the governor's office.

26:49.916 --> 26:51.375
Exterior security, it's Gandía.

26:51.458 --> 26:55.791
Activate protocol red. Close the building.

26:55.875 --> 26:57.875
-<i>Anything outside?</i>
-I can't see anything.

26:57.958 --> 26:58.958
Where was the blast?

26:59.041 --> 27:02.166
<i>In the basement, sir.</i>
<i>It may have been a gas pocket.</i>

27:02.250 --> 27:06.125
Copy that. Don't close anything.
We may need to evacuate.

27:06.208 --> 27:09.416
Maximum security alert!
Everyone with their vests on!

27:09.500 --> 27:10.625
Everyone!

27:24.875 --> 27:26.750
They have military weapons in there.

27:26.833 --> 27:30.625
I think he caresses them in the evenings,
longing to pull the trigger.

27:30.708 --> 27:34.458
He was a green beret.
He's been on the job for three years.

27:34.541 --> 27:38.625
He was the minister of the interior's
personal bodyguard before that.

27:38.916 --> 27:41.750
He was deployed on special ops
in Iraq and Lebanon.

27:41.833 --> 27:43.833
Those are just the official ones

27:43.916 --> 27:47.583
because during the six years
he was in special ops,

27:47.791 --> 27:50.791
there are no records of his movements.
That means...

27:52.333 --> 27:54.875
clandestine operations, secret missions...

27:55.958 --> 27:57.791
He's a killer, Sergio.

27:58.916 --> 27:59.833
He's a killer.

28:05.458 --> 28:08.666
-Have you found the gun rack?
-<i>We can't find it.</i>

28:08.750 --> 28:11.791
We've looked everywhere,
but there's no sign of weapons.

28:11.875 --> 28:15.041
I don't know about the guns,
but his cuffs were in the library.

28:17.291 --> 28:19.541
<i>The bastard escaped from them by himself.</i>

28:19.625 --> 28:21.166
<i>Like a child at Disneyland.</i>

28:22.166 --> 28:24.000
We kill him, or he kills us.

28:25.625 --> 28:26.916
I saw him too.

28:28.291 --> 28:30.291
I could see right through him.

28:31.541 --> 28:35.333
If he gets the chance,
it'll be like he's playing a shoot-'em-up.

28:47.958 --> 28:50.875
Faced with the slightest risk,
act decisively.

28:51.333 --> 28:52.708
In self-defense...

28:54.083 --> 28:55.458
but without hesitation.

28:57.125 --> 28:58.666
Because he won't hesitate.

29:00.791 --> 29:02.916
<i>He's an unscrupulous ex-combatant.</i>

29:04.708 --> 29:08.208
<i>He's merciless.</i>
<i>And he's trying to kill you.</i>

29:08.916 --> 29:10.708
What about the command center?

29:11.000 --> 29:13.875
I'll make sure their hands are tied
so they respect the truce.

29:15.250 --> 29:16.083
And also...

29:19.833 --> 29:22.583
I'll make them see
that we're better than ever.

29:30.083 --> 29:30.916
Right.

29:31.250 --> 29:34.958
You need to take long, deep breaths.

29:39.083 --> 29:41.791
Very good. Tell me something you love.

29:42.208 --> 29:43.041
The sea.

29:43.500 --> 29:47.250
The sea is perfect for this exercise.
Close your eyes.

29:48.625 --> 29:50.625
Good. Now, Amanda,

29:50.708 --> 29:53.083
imagine it's a hot summer's day.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.500
You're on the beach,

29:55.833 --> 29:59.666
at the water's edge,
with the waves lapping at your feet.

30:00.250 --> 30:02.916
-Can you feel it?
-Yes, I can.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.083
Now we're floating
on an air mattress in the water.

30:06.708 --> 30:07.875
The sea breeze...

30:09.958 --> 30:11.583
on the shore.

30:13.750 --> 30:15.333
And the smell of summer.

30:15.416 --> 30:17.333
I'm getting sleepy.

30:17.416 --> 30:20.041
Let the sound of the sea carry you away.

30:20.125 --> 30:22.208
Let the sea rock you to sleep.

30:22.875 --> 30:24.250
The sea...

30:24.333 --> 30:25.958
Amanda...

30:26.333 --> 30:27.291
Amanda...

30:28.458 --> 30:29.291
Come.

31:24.291 --> 31:26.791
<i>If you're calling to negotiate, press one.</i>

31:27.125 --> 31:29.625
<i>If you're calling to surrender, press two.</i>

31:29.875 --> 31:33.333
If you're calling to ask what I'm wearing,
press pound.

31:33.416 --> 31:35.291
-I caught you at a good time.
-<i>Yes.</i>

31:35.375 --> 31:37.208
It's a beautiful day.

31:37.625 --> 31:41.125
I'm glad. I wasn't sure how
you'd take the news I'm about to give you.

31:41.208 --> 31:43.958
<i>I just sent an exclusive</i>
<i>to a national newspaper.</i>

31:44.750 --> 31:48.708
They'll call asking you to confirm
that there's a truce. I hope you do.

31:49.958 --> 31:51.708
Why would I do that?

31:51.791 --> 31:55.875
Because if you don't, I'll leak
that you pretended to kill Lisbon,

31:56.375 --> 32:00.916
<i>that she's been illegally held since then,</i>
<i>and you're refusing to take her to court.</i>

32:01.000 --> 32:02.291
Those are trifles.

32:04.166 --> 32:07.166
I also have a recording
of the supposed execution.

32:07.250 --> 32:08.083
Bastard.

32:08.541 --> 32:11.875
<i>I can also tell them you're negotiating</i>
<i>by threatening to arrest</i>

32:12.708 --> 32:14.416
<i>her daughter and mother.</i>

32:14.500 --> 32:16.500
But between you and me...

32:17.583 --> 32:19.125
you're too late for that.

32:20.583 --> 32:23.875
<i>Those three CNI agents</i>
<i>at Katipunan police HQ in Mindanao,</i>

32:23.958 --> 32:26.750
and the Spanish consul,
Mr. Leopoldo Gis Bornay,

32:26.833 --> 32:29.833
arriving in Manila
to coordinate the operation...

32:30.958 --> 32:33.375
<i>Save the taxpayers' money,</i>
<i>and while you're at it,</i>

32:33.458 --> 32:37.583
<i>-save yourselves the embarrassment.</i>
<i>-</i>You love hearing yourself talk.

32:37.666 --> 32:40.500
You're like a radio host.
Get to the point.

32:41.166 --> 32:42.291
What do you want?

32:43.458 --> 32:48.250
I need to be sure about the truce.
I have someone fighting for their life.

32:51.375 --> 32:53.208
Your word isn't enough anymore.

32:57.250 --> 32:59.083
Confirm it with the press.

33:00.375 --> 33:04.708
And in order to prove your goodwill
and boost the morale of everyone inside,

33:04.791 --> 33:06.166
including the hostages,

33:06.250 --> 33:08.833
I'd like to ask for one more thing.

33:22.958 --> 33:26.375
<i>News of the truce</i>
<i>was all over the press in minutes.</i>

33:29.458 --> 33:30.958
<i>The headline was good.</i>

33:32.208 --> 33:33.750
<i>But the photo was better:</i>

33:38.000 --> 33:40.708
<i>the police leaving us eight paellas,</i>

33:41.000 --> 33:43.583
<i>14 loaves of bread</i>
<i>and two cases of wine.</i>

33:44.000 --> 33:46.125
<i>It looked like the start of a party.</i>

33:46.333 --> 33:47.750
This smells so good.

33:54.583 --> 33:57.500
<i>But inside,</i>
<i>it felt like the buildup to a funeral.</i>

34:05.500 --> 34:08.791
<i>What you don't see is usually</i>
<i>more important than what you do see.</i>

34:08.875 --> 34:12.125
<i>And Gandía,</i>
<i>on the verge of screwing our lives up,</i>

34:12.916 --> 34:13.958
<i>was invisible.</i>

34:14.166 --> 34:17.958
Stockholm and Rio swept the first floor.
There's no sign of him. Listen.

34:18.041 --> 34:19.958
The basements are my blind spots.

34:20.458 --> 34:22.875
<i>Helsinki to the east basement,</i>
<i>you to the west.</i>

35:36.000 --> 35:36.833
<i>Tokyo.</i>

35:37.708 --> 35:41.375
I've just lost
the cameras inside the bank. All of them.

35:44.625 --> 35:45.750
You're on your own.

35:52.708 --> 35:56.208
<i>What we don't see affects our lives</i>
<i>much more than it seems.</i>

36:04.708 --> 36:05.958
Nurse.

36:09.541 --> 36:11.166
Let's see how you're doing.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.625
And to think I didn't trust you before.

36:21.125 --> 36:22.000
Why not?

36:23.500 --> 36:26.833
Because you're
from Palermo and Berlin's gang.

36:29.208 --> 36:31.916
And because you act like an Iberian male.

36:33.625 --> 36:35.625
Macho, but a big, strong fellow.

36:35.958 --> 36:37.500
Built like a castle.

36:38.791 --> 36:40.541
He's sensitive is what he is.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.666
I'm going to give you a shot,
Nairobi, honey.

36:44.916 --> 36:45.791
Another one?

36:46.291 --> 36:49.166
-Can't you give her a break?
-They're antibiotics.

36:49.500 --> 36:51.500
She's at risk of infection.

36:52.791 --> 36:54.416
You're awesome, Paquita.

36:54.958 --> 36:57.041
I told her to give me another shot.

36:58.333 --> 37:01.000
Well, if it's on the patient's orders...

37:06.041 --> 37:10.916
You know how I said...
I wouldn't touch you with a ten-foot pole?

37:14.750 --> 37:16.125
I'm reconsidering.

37:22.500 --> 37:25.833
That was a very clear
declaration of your intentions.

37:26.250 --> 37:27.458
Am I wrong, Paquita?

37:34.541 --> 37:38.041
When you said that...
ten-foot pole thing...

37:41.083 --> 37:42.250
you already had me.

37:45.125 --> 37:47.416
Now I can picture you...

37:48.083 --> 37:50.291
all dressed in white.

37:50.375 --> 37:51.958
"I do."

37:52.041 --> 37:54.250
-Wait...
-The reception, the friends,

37:54.333 --> 37:57.041
-the boozing--
-Don't get your hopes up.

37:57.458 --> 38:00.208
You're not having your eighth kid with me.

38:16.833 --> 38:19.833
<i>What we don't see is also</i>
<i>what haunts us the most.</i>

38:20.791 --> 38:21.875
He's not here.

38:22.250 --> 38:27.250
<i>Because once the doubts start...</i>
<i>it's not easy to stop them.</i>

38:27.333 --> 38:28.166
Rio.

38:30.416 --> 38:32.916
Why don't you have scars from the torture?

38:39.083 --> 38:40.833
You haven't even lost weight.

38:44.291 --> 38:45.875
How did Gandía break free?

38:50.333 --> 38:51.958
Why are you asking me that?

38:58.875 --> 39:00.250
Because you lied.

39:02.000 --> 39:06.208
You didn't tell the Professor everything,
and he said to be precise.

39:10.750 --> 39:12.333
Why did you only tell me?

39:12.875 --> 39:13.708
Why?

39:14.750 --> 39:15.583
Why?

39:19.083 --> 39:19.958
Why me?

39:21.375 --> 39:24.166
Because there's so much shit in my head,
I can't sleep.

39:24.250 --> 39:27.083
I didn't want to remember it
or be pitied even more.

39:27.166 --> 39:28.750
I didn't want to describe

39:28.833 --> 39:31.125
how I cried hopelessly in that coffin

39:31.208 --> 39:35.041
and that the only thing I wanted
was to be in my bedroom

39:35.375 --> 39:36.625
and to hug my mother,

39:36.708 --> 39:39.208
who I thought would never know
what happened to me

39:39.291 --> 39:41.500
because she wouldn't have
a grave to visit.

39:41.583 --> 39:42.875
-Rio--
-I cried so much

39:42.958 --> 39:46.083
that I had spasms
and hit my head on the coffin lid.

39:46.166 --> 39:47.500
Sand fell into my eyes,

39:47.583 --> 39:49.041
-and I kept crying.
-Stop.

39:49.291 --> 39:52.250
Is that it?
Is that what you wanted me to tell you?

39:56.416 --> 39:58.916
Forgive me. I'm sorry.

40:02.291 --> 40:04.125
It's OK.

40:05.791 --> 40:06.625
I'm sorry.

40:08.166 --> 40:09.416
Easy.

40:13.166 --> 40:14.208
It's all right.

40:15.000 --> 40:15.958
No, it's not.

40:16.416 --> 40:19.250
Sorry. I'm scared.
I don't know what I'm saying.

40:21.541 --> 40:23.000
I'll make you trust me.

40:24.833 --> 40:25.708
Rio.

40:28.583 --> 40:29.958
What are you gonna do?

40:33.291 --> 40:34.833
I'm going to kill Gandía.

40:37.500 --> 40:39.500
<i>You look for what you don't see.</i>

40:39.666 --> 40:43.375
<i>But sometimes, you forget</i>
<i>the invisible might be watching you.</i>

40:44.125 --> 40:45.958
<i>And then you're in trouble.</i>

41:12.625 --> 41:14.625
Yeah, that's better. Right, babe?

41:14.708 --> 41:17.000
Now we're all cheered up.

41:17.083 --> 41:18.625
Look at those faces.

41:18.708 --> 41:21.708
No one else is going to rebel now, babe.

41:21.791 --> 41:24.791
How wonderful!
What an amazing transformation

41:24.875 --> 41:26.916
with a simple paella and a beer.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.583
A round of applause for the bank robbers.

41:29.666 --> 41:32.375
Stop screwing around
and shut the fuck up, now!

41:33.375 --> 41:34.875
You have to let me go.

41:35.666 --> 41:37.416
I smashed his head in.

41:37.500 --> 41:39.125
Leave me here, tied up,

41:39.208 --> 41:41.750
and it'll be worse than murder.
Free me.

41:43.875 --> 41:46.208
Why would he kill you now?
He didn't before.

41:47.666 --> 41:48.625
Don't worry.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.916
We're looking for him now.

41:51.583 --> 41:55.333
Great. You're looking for him.
That's good to know. Very good.

41:55.833 --> 41:57.500
And it's also good to know

41:57.833 --> 42:00.833
that they put you in charge
of the kids in the nursery.

42:03.041 --> 42:06.708
What a wise decision, huh?
Who made that decision?

42:12.791 --> 42:14.375
She chose Rio.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.833
She chose the IT genius

42:18.916 --> 42:23.000
to go hunt the most dangerous
professional killer in all Spain.

42:23.666 --> 42:24.708
That's brilliant.

42:26.791 --> 42:30.458
A traumatized little boy
who can't even bring himself to shoot.

42:31.500 --> 42:35.625
And he's hand in hand with your ex,
crying in corners around the bank.

42:35.708 --> 42:37.125
What a beautiful story.

42:39.583 --> 42:41.500
He'll kill them, one by one.

42:41.583 --> 42:44.791
When are you going to understand
that Tokyo's in charge?

42:44.875 --> 42:49.041
This isn't about operating on Nairobi.
This is about survival, brother.

42:50.083 --> 42:53.833
-Come here, moron, come here.
-What is it? What do you want now?

42:56.125 --> 42:59.000
Listen, I know you really love Tokyo.

43:00.500 --> 43:02.458
You've been through a lot together.

43:04.875 --> 43:08.458
But do you think
she's the leader we deserve right now?

43:09.083 --> 43:10.916
With your hand on your heart...

43:15.333 --> 43:16.833
do you trust Tokyo?

43:26.416 --> 43:31.041
You have to free me, brother.
You know it's the right thing to do.

43:31.333 --> 43:34.583
You have to take me upstairs.
You have to free me.

43:36.708 --> 43:38.083
Come on. Hey.

43:38.166 --> 43:39.625
Shut up!

43:40.000 --> 43:41.500
Matías, you're in charge.

43:47.875 --> 43:48.750
Almost.

43:49.458 --> 43:52.333
Rio!

43:52.416 --> 43:55.416
-Where are you going?
<i>-</i>To kill that son of a bitch.

43:55.500 --> 43:57.666
Rio, stop. I said stop!

44:03.958 --> 44:05.375
Sorry about before.

44:06.750 --> 44:08.375
I've got a lot going on.

44:09.375 --> 44:12.500
But let me be clear:
I know you're an honorable man.

44:13.166 --> 44:15.000
I know you'd never betray us.

44:19.541 --> 44:22.291
Let's get that bastard together. Let's go.

45:52.416 --> 45:53.750
<i>Hello, National Police.</i>

45:53.833 --> 45:57.583
This is César Gandía, head of security
for the governor of the Bank of Spain.

45:57.666 --> 46:00.375
I'm calling
on a Ministry of the Interior secure line.

46:00.458 --> 46:01.916
Can you see that?

46:02.000 --> 46:04.875
<i>-Yes, it's a line from the Bank of Spain.</i>
-Yes.

46:04.958 --> 46:07.791
Get me the command center
outside the bank.

46:07.875 --> 46:09.250
Top priority.

46:14.083 --> 46:16.041
-Hello?
<i>-This is a top-priority call.</i>

46:16.125 --> 46:17.666
-<i>This is</i> <i>César Gandía.</i>
-Who?

46:17.750 --> 46:21.416
The governor's head of security.
Let me speak to Colonel Tamayo.

46:21.500 --> 46:23.291
Yes, of course. Colonel!

46:27.166 --> 46:29.333
It's the governor's head of security.

46:29.416 --> 46:31.791
-Clear the room.
-Clear the area, please.

46:32.916 --> 46:34.375
<i>Colonel Tamayo speaking.</i>

46:34.750 --> 46:37.500
Colonel, I managed to break free.
It's Gandía.

46:37.583 --> 46:41.583
-Where are you calling from?
-From the panic room.

46:41.666 --> 46:45.125
I can monitor all their movements
with the internal CCTV.

46:45.208 --> 46:48.875
I've cut all external connections
so they can't see us from outside.

46:48.958 --> 46:50.666
<i>I'm awaiting your instructions.</i>

46:52.625 --> 46:56.583
For now, remain inactive.
We have a truce.

46:56.958 --> 46:59.541
What truce, Colonel?
How long is the truce?

47:01.083 --> 47:04.000
There are more than 24 hours left.
I can't get out of it.

47:04.083 --> 47:05.333
It's in the news.

47:05.416 --> 47:08.458
In 24 hours,
these bastards will be in Singapore.

47:08.541 --> 47:11.666
Let's launch a coordinated attack.
We'll take them by surprise.

47:11.750 --> 47:13.625
It'll be over in ten minutes.

47:14.125 --> 47:15.791
<i>My hands are tied.</i>

47:15.875 --> 47:18.875
<i>The Presidency doesn't want</i>
<i>more battles in Madrid.</i>

47:20.916 --> 47:22.875
Sir, I've got automatic weapons,

47:22.958 --> 47:24.291
grenades, everything.

47:24.375 --> 47:27.958
I won't wait for them to escape.
I haven't signed any truce.

47:28.041 --> 47:30.125
<i>Do you understand what I'm saying?</i>

47:39.583 --> 47:43.333
Officially,
I can only command you to wait...

47:44.166 --> 47:46.708
<i>even if that's not</i>
<i>what I'd like you to do.</i>

47:47.416 --> 47:48.833
What does that mean?

47:49.416 --> 47:52.583
Whatever you do
will be considered self-defense.

47:52.666 --> 47:54.416
There will be no legal issues.

47:54.500 --> 47:57.416
If you eliminate them all,
you'd be a hero to me,

47:57.500 --> 48:00.125
to the investigators,
and to the government.

48:00.666 --> 48:01.750
Copy that.

48:03.000 --> 48:03.875
Good luck.

48:04.541 --> 48:06.291
<i>The most important moments</i>

48:06.375 --> 48:09.083
<i>are when we realize there's no going back.</i>

48:09.666 --> 48:12.875
<i>That you've crossed a line,</i>
<i>and there's no way back.</i>

48:13.625 --> 48:15.000
<i>The point of no return.</i>

48:16.500 --> 48:20.541
<i>Everything is about to change,</i>
<i>and you cling to the present...</i>

48:20.875 --> 48:23.083
<i>as if you could stop the disaster.</i>

48:25.583 --> 48:27.166
How are you doing?

48:27.750 --> 48:29.833
I guess it won't come as a surprise...

48:32.208 --> 48:33.708
but we arrived in Mindanao,

48:33.791 --> 48:37.166
and your mother and daughter
were no longer there. Ta-da!

48:39.166 --> 48:43.875
I'd congratulate you...<i> </i>but you know what?

48:46.041 --> 48:46.875
I won't.

48:47.416 --> 48:51.208
Because Rio,
before he went into the bank,

48:52.000 --> 48:54.375
gave up all the carriers.

49:01.375 --> 49:03.625
He didn't tell the Professor.

49:04.583 --> 49:06.125
I was listening.

49:21.000 --> 49:24.666
How quickly do you think
he'll give me your mom and daughter?

49:41.916 --> 49:43.916
-<i>Professor.</i>
-Yes, Antoñanzas?

49:44.708 --> 49:47.083
<i>I know I shouldn't tell you this, but...</i>

49:49.958 --> 49:50.791
But what?

50:03.958 --> 50:06.250
There will be casualties,
Tamayo's orders.

50:06.333 --> 50:08.875
<i>-In cold blood. It's a crime.</i>
-What's going on?

50:09.375 --> 50:12.291
<i>Gandía, the head of security,</i>
<i>called the tent.</i>

50:12.375 --> 50:16.208
-He has a panic room and military weapons.
<i>-</i>Where is the room?

50:17.125 --> 50:20.291
<i>I don't know, but it has cameras.</i>
<i>He can see everything.</i>

50:34.083 --> 50:34.958
Tokyo.

50:36.708 --> 50:38.500
-<i>Tokyo.</i>
-Professor.

50:38.583 --> 50:42.375
Listen to me.
Gandía is armed. He has a panic room.

50:43.500 --> 50:46.250
-What?
-He has a panic room.

50:46.333 --> 50:50.291
He's watching. He knows where you all are.
Get everyone together.

50:53.375 --> 50:54.208
Tokyo?

51:05.041 --> 51:05.916
Tokyo?

51:08.708 --> 51:10.833
<i>Tokyo?</i>
