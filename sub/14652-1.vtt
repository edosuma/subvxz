Captain James Tiberius Kirk

01:26.680 --> 01:28.875
of the United Federation of Planets.

01:29.200 --> 01:32.431
I am appearing before you
as a neutral representative

01:32.520 --> 01:34.192
of the Fibonan Republic.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.836
I bring you a message of goodwill

01:37.040 --> 01:40.032
and present to you esteemed members
of the Teenaxi Delegation,

01:40.680 --> 01:45.037
a gift from the Fibonan High Council
with the highest regard.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.713
What's wrong with it?

01:51.040 --> 01:52.040
Uh, excuse me?

01:52.440 --> 01:54.351
Why don't they want it anymore?

01:54.440 --> 01:57.591
Uh, well, this was once
a piece of an ancient weapon,

01:57.720 --> 01:59.676
and now they offer it as a symbol of...

02:00.400 --> 02:01.628
Of peace.

02:02.040 --> 02:03.314
In the Fibonan culture,

02:03.400 --> 02:05.709
to surrender a weapon
is an offer of truce.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.153
How did they come by it?

02:07.240 --> 02:09.674
They told me
they acquired it a long time ago.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.194
So they stole it, then.

02:12.120 --> 02:15.271
No, they, um... Well, I don't know.

02:15.360 --> 02:17.920
You don't know the Fibonans like we do!

02:18.400 --> 02:20.456
(STAMMERS) Yeah, that's very true.
Your Excellency, this gift...

02:20.480 --> 02:23.074
They're a crowd of untrustworthy thieves

02:23.160 --> 02:25.628
who want to see us murdered
in our own beds!

02:26.080 --> 02:29.959
This beloved artifact
is a symbol of trust and peace.

02:30.360 --> 02:33.318
They want to chop us into pieces
and roast us over a fire!

Captain, did you manage
to broker a treaty with the Teenaxi?

Uh... Let's just say I came up short.

03:37.400 --> 03:41.916
Will you, uh, log that and put it
in the vault, Spock? Thank you.

KIRK: Captain's Log, Stardate 2263.2.

04:04.360 --> 04:08.592
Today is our 966th day in deep space,

04:08.680 --> 04:11.831
a little under three years
into our five-year mission.

04:13.960 --> 04:15.313
The more time we spend out here,

04:16.120 --> 04:19.237
the harder it is to tell
where one day ends

04:20.200 --> 04:21.872
and the next one begins.

04:25.280 --> 04:30.035
It can be a challenge to feel grounded
when even gravity is artificial.

04:31.040 --> 04:34.112
But, well, we do what we can
to make it feel like home.

04:37.520 --> 04:40.114
The crew, as always,
continues to act admirably

04:40.200 --> 04:43.829
despite the rigors of our extended stay
here in outer space.

04:45.920 --> 04:48.912
And the personal sacrifices
they have made.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.296
We continue to search
for new life forms

04:51.320 --> 04:54.471
in order to establish firm diplomatic ties.

04:55.280 --> 04:56.918
Our extended time in uncharted territory

04:57.000 --> 04:59.275
has stretched the ship's
mechanical capacities.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.675
But fortunately
our engineering department,

05:01.760 --> 05:04.832
led by Mr. Scott,
is more than up to the job.

05:06.240 --> 05:09.789
The ship aside,
prolonged cohabitation has

05:09.880 --> 05:13.236
definitely had effects
on interpersonal dynamics.

05:14.160 --> 05:16.549
Some experiences for the better,

05:17.480 --> 05:19.835
and some for the worse.

05:25.120 --> 05:29.796
As for me, things have started to feel
a little episodic.

05:31.440 --> 05:34.238
The farther out we go,
the more I find myself wondering

05:34.320 --> 05:36.436
what it is we're trying to accomplish.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.753
If the universe is truly endless,

05:40.120 --> 05:43.078
then are we not striving
for something forever out of reach?

05:45.160 --> 05:48.675
The Enterprise is scheduled
for a reprovisioning stop at Yorktown,

05:48.760 --> 05:51.911

and most advanced starbase.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.356
Perhaps a break from routine
will offer up some respite

05:55.440 --> 05:58.113
from the mysteries of the unknown.

06:13.960 --> 06:15.359
Sorry I'm late.

06:15.440 --> 06:18.557

some kind of highly acidic green goo,

06:18.640 --> 06:21.108

he's gonna sneeze on the warp core

06:21.200 --> 06:22.400
- and kill us all.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.560

it's the rest of that Saurian brandy

06:27.640 --> 06:28.789
we picked up on Thasus.

06:29.280 --> 06:31.350
My God, man, are you trying to go blind?

06:31.880 --> 06:33.632
That stuff's illegal.

06:34.640 --> 06:37.996
Besides, I found this in Chekov's locker.

06:39.640 --> 06:40.640
- Wow.
- Right?

06:40.680 --> 06:42.159
I mean, I always assumed he'd be

06:42.440 --> 06:43.998
- a vodka man.
- A vodka guy, exactly.

06:44.360 --> 06:47.113
I wanted to have
something appropriate for your birthday.

06:47.440 --> 06:50.352
Uh, that's in a couple days.
You know I don't care about that.

06:50.440 --> 06:53.079
I know. I know you don't like
celebrating it on the day

06:53.160 --> 06:55.674
because it's also the day
your pa bit the dust.

06:55.760 --> 06:56.795
I was being sensitive.

06:57.160 --> 06:59.799
Did they teach you about
bedside manner in medical school?

He believed in it.

if you could live up to him.

trying to be George Kirk

07:57.080 --> 07:59.913

just what it means to be Jim.

say something, lassie?

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.560
Because I know you will
ask me to take you there.

01:09:03.279 --> 01:09:06.397

then they will die, just like my family.

to that death place!

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:10.720
Aye, but if you've escaped,

01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:12.576
then you can show us
the way in and the way out.

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:50.950
Krall would come and take someone.

01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:53.278
There were screams.

01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:55.438
I can still hear them.

01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:58.677
And we would not see
that person again.

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:01.069
We did not know who would be next.

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:08.796

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:12.996
But we were seen
by the one they call Manas.

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:19.150
My father fought him so I could get out.

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:23.278
He was brave and Manas killed him.

"Ya cannae break a stick in a bundle."

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.956

is all about.

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:51.156

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.991
All I know is we stand
a better chance with you.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.833
The digging machines uncovered
a tunnel that goes into the crater.

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.069
That's how I got out.

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.832
So that'll be our way in.

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:07.016
An away team will beam
to the other side of the tunnel,

01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:08.189
follow it to Krall's base,

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:10.191
get inside the building
and break out the crew.

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:13.593
Uh, Captain, we cannot lock
onto anyone inside the crater

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:14.829
in order to beam them out.

01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:17.070
Oh, I could rig up pulse beacons
as pattern enhancers.

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:18.336
That'd get the signal out of the crater.

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:19.416

Bones, Mr. Chekov, Jaylah,

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.496
you're with me on the away team.

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:29.351
Mr. Scott, modify that transporter

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:31.616
and then do everything you can
to get this ship operational.

01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:33.358
Captain, Mr. Chekov's technical acumen

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:36.193
makes him more valuable
aboard the Franklin with Mr. Scott.

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:38.120
It is thereby logical
that I would replace him.

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:39.868
Why is that logical, Spock?

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:41.200

It was used by the Ancient Ones
as a weapon.

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:40.477
But when they could not
control its deadly power,

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:42.790
they split it into two

01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:45.275
and ejected the halves into space,

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.990

Captain, the flight patterns of bees
are determined by individual decisions.

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:34.549

are too complex not to rely

01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:37.229

Captain, my familiarity
of the interior of those ships,

01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:59.040

for this away mission.

01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:03.033
She's right, Spock.

and respect your concerns.

01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:05.416
Captain, from what I can ascertain,

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:07.192
the ships do indeed share
a cyberpathic link

01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:08.600
which coordinates their actions.

01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:12.751
That's what that signal was.

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:16.229
They weren't jamming us,
they were talking to each other.

01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:18.515
Well, how do we get them
to stop talking?

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:20.352
What about electromagnetic focusing?

01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:22.136
We could use the transporters,
disrupt their network.

01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:23.832
SPOCK: The focus might be too specific.

01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:27.096
If we could plant some sort of disruptive
communication signal inside the swarm,

01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:29.256
it might adversely affect
their capacity to coordinate.

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:31.840
It would have to be
at a frequency they will not anticipate.

01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:33.096
We could cause a chain reaction

01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:34.560
that would wipe out the whole swarm.

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:35.919
Sir, a closed network like that

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.594
might be susceptible
to very high frequency.

01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:18.720
(SNIFFLES)

01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:21.030
All distress calls unanswered.

01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:22.755
Of the crew,

01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:25.959
only three remain.

01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:28.471
I won't allow it!

01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:34.030
The indigenous race
abandoned this planet long ago.

01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:37.552
They left behind sophisticated
mining equipment

01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:39.553
and a drone workforce.

01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:43.233
They have some sort of technology

01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:46.312
that prolongs life.

01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:50.112
I will do whatever it takes
for me and my crew.

01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:52.751
The Federation do not care about us.

01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:01.439
You'll probably never see me again.

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:02.913
But if you do,

01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:05.919
be ready.

01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:09.198
Why has he not used his weapon yet?

01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:12.040
'Cause he wants to find somewhere
to inflict maximum damage.

01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:13.759
He needs a distribution system.

01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:16.816
They have to circulate air here, right?

01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:19.354
Aye, sir. There's an atmospheric
regulator at the core.

01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:21.696
Lieutenant, contact Yorktown.
Make sure they shut it down

01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:23.120
- until we find Krall.
- UHURA: Yes.

01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:24.600
How would he access the core?

01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:26.837
Uh, well, there's a maintenance tower

01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:29.201
at the station's gravitational nexus.
That's the only way.

01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:31.914
Scotty, you get over there.
Make sure it gets shut down!

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.115
Lassie, you're with me.

01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:42.519
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:48.755
Look, this thing
is impossible to shut down.

01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:50.114
Aye, well,

01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:53.313
we'll see about that.

01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:55.960
(PANTING)

01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:02.798
Mr. Scott, why is that thing still on?

01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:04.160
We're working on it, sir,

01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:06.416
but as you can imagine
there's a lot of safety protocols

01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:07.920
surrounding the thing that, you know,

01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:09.916
- keeps everybody alive.
- Figure something out.

01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:11.120
Be careful, Captain.

01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:12.838
Gravity's gonna get a bit screwy

01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:14.518
the closer you get to the center.

01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:16.496
Maybe we should scan
the operational schematics,

01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:18.296
- see if there's a back door.
- FINNEGAN: Right.

01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:19.640
Lassie, I'm gonna need your eyes.

01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:25.680
(BEEPS)

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.000
(GRUNTS)

01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:30.149
KRALL: Stop!

01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:35.760
(PANTING)

01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:39.951
What happened to you
out there, Edison?

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.228
Edison.

01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:48.869
I have to say, Kirk,

01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:52.839
I've missed being me.

01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:58.192
We lost ourselves but gained a purpose!

01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:01.508
A means to bring the galaxy

01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:05.309
back to the struggle
that made humanity strong.

01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:07.713
I think you underestimate humanity.

01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:10.071
I fought for humanity!

01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:14.872
Lost millions to the Xindi
and Romulan Wars.

01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:16.508
And for what?

01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:20.190
For the Federation
to sit me in a captain's chair

01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:23.393
and break bread with the enemy.

01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:25.876
We change. We have to.

01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:30.397
Or we spend the rest of our lives
fighting the same battles.

01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:10.955
There's no way
you can make it back there.

01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:15.119
Give up.

01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:17.792
What, like you did?

01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:22.110
I read your ship's log,

01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:24.436
Captain James T. Kirk.

01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:26.234
At least I know what I am.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.479
I am a soldier.

01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:31.830
You won the war, Edison.

01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:34.751
You gave us peace.

01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:36.274
Peace

01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:39.431
is not what I was born into.

01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:46.456
SCOTTY: Captain, he's using
the gravitational slipstream

01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:48.072
to carry him back to the center.

01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:51.600
Nah.

No! No!

01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:42.776
- What's that?
- The weapon's in the chamber.

01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:44.472
Captain, we have to stop
the processor now

01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:47.279
or everything breathing
in Yorktown is dead!

01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:56.115
(GROANS)

01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:58.668
You can't stop it.

01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:01.713
You will die.

01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:04.876
Better to die saving lives

01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:07.556
than to live with taking them.

01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:10.591
That's what I was born into.

01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:12.240
Scotty!

01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:14.016
SCOTTY: Captain,
I think we can redirect it.

01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:15.792
There's a sealed construction hatch

01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:17.616
that will let you vent the weapon
into space.

01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:19.056
Now, we can override
the locks from up here,

01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:20.536
but you will have to activate the hatch.

01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:21.788
So I just hit a button.

01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:25.395
It's not a button, sir.
It's a silver lever under a white panel.

01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:28.196
- Got it!
- And there's four of them.

01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:30.000
Once you've primed the hatch,

01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:31.800
you'll have to exit
the chamber immediately.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.800
If the hatch is open
when the processor cycles

01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:36.040
and you're in it,
you're gonna get sucked into space.

01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:37.911
What happens if the hatch isn't open?

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.560
You're gonna get sucked into a big fan.

01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:42.036
With the weapon, and we all die.

01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:45.280
Damn it, Jim, you won't
make it out in time!

the Federation taught that he was a hero.

01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:12.078
He just got lost.

01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:14.118
You saved this entire base, Kirk.

01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:18.519

It wasn't just me. It never is.

Needless to say, the position
of Vice Admiral is yours.

01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:28.593
No one deserves it more.

01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:34.431
Vice Admirals don't fly, do they?

01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:38.070
No. They don't.

01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:42.511
Well, no offense, ma'am,

01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:45.433
but where's the fun in that?

01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:50.040
MCCOY: You didn't even
try to get our time out here reduced?

01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:51.256
Why would I get it reduced?

01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:53.669
Bones, we know our way
through the nebula now.

01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:55.513

under wraps, but, uh...

Whose round is it?

01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:48.395
Can I get three, uh,
Romulan ales for me?

01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:51.554
I thought you had to
finish your mission report.

01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:53.468
I do.

01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:56.916
But I thought it would be more pleasing
to engage with you socially.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:00.274
You old romantic.

Uh, did you drink all those yourself?
I'm impressed.

01:51:21.680 --> 01:51:23.910
Someone said it will take my edge off.

01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:26.192
My edge is still not off.

Don't listen to them all.

01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:58.430
I heard about Ambassador Spock.

01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:03.237

to mention that time in the turbolift?

to head back out there, huh?
