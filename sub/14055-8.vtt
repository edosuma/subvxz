00:01.659 --> 00:04.090
I don't want this to be like kissing your sister.

00:04.167 --> 00:06.662
- Kirsten doesn't know you're seeing Lindsay, right?
- She thinks we're just friends.

00:06.869 --> 00:09.673
I know you're not on the market for any new relatives. How about a friend?

00:09.830 --> 00:12.232
I did a musical or two myself in college.

00:12.303 --> 00:14.499
Please stop him before he starts singing Greased Lightning.

00:14.553 --> 00:16.636
- Are you drunk?
- She was like this when I picked her up.

00:16.843 --> 00:19.821
- You don't have to defend yourself to her
- No, but you do, young lady.

00:19.986 --> 00:22.815
- I need to go see a girl.
- Which girl is this? The one who thinks you're too nice?

00:23.043 --> 00:25.390
- You stole a car?
- Yep, I do it for kicks.

00:25.603 --> 00:27.451
- Are you trying to impress me or something?
- What?

00:27.562 --> 00:30.579
You're a good guy and that's why I like you

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074

00:48.419 --> 00:51.952
- Cohen residence.
- Ryan, good. I was hoping you'd answer.

00:52.329 --> 00:55.012
- If you're alone, cough twice.
- I'm alone.

00:55.145 --> 00:57.466
- Ok, it's not as stealth, but it works too.
- Where are you?

00:57.590 --> 01:00.408
- Remember last night when I said that I was going to bed?
- Didn't happen, huh?

01:00.568 --> 01:04.282
Oh, no, it did, just not my bed.
But I did bring my favorite pillow.

01:04.477 --> 01:06.897
You know the really fluffy one?

01:09.092 --> 01:12.759
- You sure you don't want to stick around for a little home schooling?
- Maybe I do.

01:12.916 --> 01:15.520
- Seth, your parents are both awake.
- That's why I need you to cover for me.

01:15.680 --> 01:17.671
Yeah, let me think about that.

01:19.552 --> 01:22.763
- No.
- Ryan, think of my parents for a second, ok?

01:22.921 --> 01:24.970
They don't want to know I spent all night with a lady.

01:25.326 --> 01:29.228
It's only going to hurt and upset them.
You know how fragile they are in the mornings.Okay? Thank you.

01:36.465 --> 01:37.634
Hello.

01:37.708 --> 01:40.923
Whoa, well, top of the morning to you too.

01:42.637 --> 01:44.802
Happy Anniversary.

01:47.890 --> 01:50.722
Happy Anniversary to you as well.

01:50.978 --> 01:52.377
I love you.

01:54.430 --> 01:55.844
I love you, too.

01:59.724 --> 02:03.279
I love you more now than I did 19years ago

02:04.265 --> 02:07.836
You mean you love me more now than you did the year after we got married?

02:10.118 --> 02:12.195
No... Come on, honey, come on.

02:12.912 --> 02:17.604
No, you know what I'm saying.
That newlywed year, that doesn't count.
That's a given.

02:18.531 --> 02:22.039
- You don't know how long we've been married.
- No, no, I was kidding ya.

02:22.418 --> 02:24.590
I know it's our 20th.

02:25.823 --> 02:28.445
How could I forget that?
Who forgets their 20th anniversary?

02:31.967 --> 02:33.887
Apparently you.

02:35.027 --> 02:36.287
No, not me.

02:36.776 --> 02:39.203
If I had thought this was our 19th anniversary,

02:39.512 --> 02:42.039
I would not have planned a celebration

02:42.232 --> 02:44.761
only worthy of a 20th.

02:45.279 --> 02:47.827
- You planned something?
- Yeah.

02:49.307 --> 02:51.352
It's gonna be awesome.

02:52.645 --> 02:54.516
I got to go.

02:56.846 --> 02:59.122
Hey. You need a ride to school, like, this second?

02:59.281 --> 03:02.516
- No, thanks. Actually, I was just going to take my bike...
- Do not leave me, not now.

03:02.602 --> 03:05.183
And where the hell is Seth?
I need reinforcements.

03:05.822 --> 03:09.228
- Seth left early for school.
- He did? He never leaves early for school.

03:09.633 --> 03:13.464
- Yeah, he had a report to finish I think.
- A report? About what?

03:14.005 --> 03:16.878
The history of agriculture in 20th century California.

03:16.955 --> 03:21.231
- Wow, that's specific.
- Yep... Happy Anniversary.

03:21.509 --> 03:26.437
Hey, kid, I was a public defender for many years. I've been lied to by the 
best.

03:27.286 --> 03:29.945
He snuck out to see his girlfriend,
didn't he?

03:31.970 --> 03:33.629
Uh, no, he didn't.

04:16.517 --> 04:20.298
The history of agriculture in 20th century California?

04:20.774 --> 04:23.708
Ryan, the key to lying is to remain vague.
Have I taught you nothing?

04:23.794 --> 04:25.514
Look, I'm not a good liar, all right?

04:25.594 --> 04:28.994
Yeah, well, when it comes to hiding your relationship with Lindsay, you seem 
to not have such a problem.

04:29.091 --> 04:30.851
Well, we're both in trouble now.

04:30.971 --> 04:34.331
Yeah, I feel bad about it, but I don't know, I think you kind of deserve it 
after that.

04:34.451 --> 04:36.985
Okay, you know what? Next time find someone else to cover for you.

04:37.069 --> 04:40.102
Cover for me? Let me tell you something.

04:40.219 --> 04:44.786
If we were buddy cops,
and sometimes I like to think that we are,
I'd be riddled with bullets right now.

04:45.169 --> 04:47.319
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.Hey.

04:47.631 --> 04:51.019
- Did you read the new Whedon X-men?
- I did, and I'll tell you my problems with it; they're threefold...

04:51.130 --> 04:54.788
Okay, it is too early for comic book talk.
Are you getting a coffee?

04:55.737 --> 04:59.257
- Yeah, I'm getting two.
- Thank you, sweetie.

05:00.463 --> 05:04.431
Isn't it interesting how Summer is constantly drawn to the lovers of comic 
books?

05:04.612 --> 05:08.463
Yes, Cohen, Zach does read comic books.
But Zach also plays water polo and

05:08.559 --> 05:11.226
- looks like the guy on the Abercrombie ad.
- Ooh.

05:11.354 --> 05:14.789
Well, you read comic books and you wear the same clothes that you slept in.

05:14.846 --> 05:17.047
Excuse me, I did not sleep in these clothes.

05:17.275 --> 05:22.273
- Ok, so putting on the same sleazy shirt from yesterday is a choice; good 
to know.
- No, it was just all I had.

05:22.406 --> 05:27.123
Oh, what, did you like, shack at your girlfriend's last night? Do the walk 
of shame to school this morning?

05:29.606 --> 05:32.373
You shacked at Alex's?
You guys are shacking?

05:32.790 --> 05:36.773
- The washing machine broke.
- You know, no offense, Ryan, but you're a really bad liar.

05:36.890 --> 05:40.307
- It's cool you guys. I don't care or anything.
- No, hey, I know.

05:41.973 --> 05:43.573
Here you go.

05:43.873 --> 05:48.407
You know what, I can't drink coffee this early. It just makes me nauseous. 
Sorry.

05:52.406 --> 05:56.706
If we shoot this way, we get the house, but if we shoot the reverse we get 
the pool and the ocean.

05:56.956 --> 06:00.389
So square footage or spectacular views?
Oh... Cal?

06:01.780 --> 06:04.697
Cal? This photo shoot is important.
You could at least feign interest.

06:04.930 --> 06:07.247
That's exactly what I'm doing.

06:07.547 --> 06:09.997
- I need money.
- Well, good morning to you, too.

06:10.063 --> 06:13.180
So listen, Riviera magazine wants to do a big photo spread on us

06:13.296 --> 06:17.180
and I think it's a great opportunity for us to demonstrate the resilience 
and strength of our family.

06:17.346 --> 06:20.313
- It's wonderful exposure.
- Any chance to expose yourself?

06:20.546 --> 06:24.563
Promise me you'll be here and you'll wear something Mark Jacobs and you 
won't be off with your boyfriend.

06:24.696 --> 06:28.496
- So I can smile and pretend like we're this happy family?
- Then I can't give you any money.

06:28.679 --> 06:30.813
For the love of God.

06:33.229 --> 06:34.696
Thank you.

06:36.006 --> 06:39.473
- Great way to undercut my power.
- I happen to agree with her.

06:39.656 --> 06:44.623
We are far from the perfect family and I see no point in lying about it 
publicly.

06:46.659 --> 06:49.892
- The thing is, even if I wanted to lie about it, I can't. I can't lie.
- What do you mean?

06:50.025 --> 06:53.559
- You have like a moral objection?
- No, I mean I can't do it. I suck at it.

06:54.475 --> 06:58.058
Oh. Like the whole time you tried to pretend that you didn't really like me.

06:58.408 --> 07:01.192
- Yeah, I didn't buy that for a second.
- Yeah, thanks.

07:01.325 --> 07:06.073
I just think it's a matter of time before Kirsten catches on. I mean, she's 
already pretty mad at Seth and Sandy.

07:06.292 --> 07:08.825
Well, we'll tell her.

07:09.675 --> 07:12.359
Could we wait a little bit?

07:12.542 --> 07:18.235
Kirsten and I had plans to go to the big swap meet at the Rose Bowl and 
maybe check out Shakespeare By The Sea.

07:19.692 --> 07:24.858
- The point is, we're still getting to know each other.
- I know, I just don't want to have to lie about us.

07:25.575 --> 07:29.192
I don't want to have to either, believe me.

07:31.671 --> 07:35.771
I could still come over tonight and say we're going to study?

07:36.754 --> 07:39.254
- And really study.
- Okay, yeah, it sounds good.

07:39.554 --> 07:42.154
We'll tell them soon, I promise.

07:49.171 --> 07:53.087
Thank you. That sounds wonderful.
We'll see you then.

07:58.006 --> 08:03.239
All right, it was going to be a surprise, but seeing how this is our 20th 
anniversary,
I got to tell you.

08:04.023 --> 08:08.123
This weekend I am taking you,
my beautiful bride of 20 years,

08:08.256 --> 08:13.373
to the fabulous Montage Hotel and Resort in breathtaking Laguna Beach.

08:13.865 --> 08:16.332
The Montage gave you a reservation at the last minute?

08:16.699 --> 08:20.482
Last minute? What, the phone call?
No. That was me reconfirming.

08:20.682 --> 08:25.253
I was just making sure they didn't give away our suite that I had booked so 
many weeks in advance.

08:25.365 --> 08:29.299
Regardless of when you made the reservation, I don't think we should leave 
Seth alone right now.

08:29.482 --> 08:32.999
Seth is not going to be a problem.
Not after I get done disciplining him.

08:33.265 --> 08:35.682
The fear of God, honey. You'll see.

08:39.544 --> 08:41.460
Start packing your bags.

08:41.559 --> 08:44.560
Seth Ezekiel! Kitchen, now!

08:45.410 --> 08:48.344
And bring Mr. History of Agriculture with you.

08:55.665 --> 08:58.148
So what do you have to say for yourself?

09:03.698 --> 09:08.565
I'm sorry. And also, it was an accident.
It was not intentional. We were watching TV

09:09.015 --> 09:12.082
and we fell asleep, like mom does every time we put on a movie.

09:12.215 --> 09:14.832
I do not. I'm just resting my eyes.

09:14.915 --> 09:20.373
You're both grounded. No going out, no phones, no TV, no video games. Don't 
be a smart ass.

09:21.510 --> 09:24.960
- Do you know what this weekend is?
- Sure, it's your 20th anniversary.

09:30.343 --> 09:32.577
That's right, it is.

09:33.910 --> 09:37.460
And I have been looking forward to this weekend for quite a while.

09:39.610 --> 09:43.727
Look, we want to go away for the weekend and if we can't trust you by 
yourselves,

09:43.994 --> 09:48.427
you'll have to stay with your grandfather,
which means you'll be spending the weekend with Julie Cooper.

09:49.280 --> 09:52.496
- You can rely on us.
- You can trust us.
- Good, now go do your homework.

10:04.569 --> 10:08.503
Nothing like a little Julie Cooper to strike terror in the hearts of 
children everywhere.

10:09.020 --> 10:13.120
- That's very impressive.
- So, shall I schedule a couple's massage?

10:14.620 --> 10:17.553
Do you know what the gender for maison is?

10:17.820 --> 10:20.887
- What?
- "Maison", our French homework?

10:21.120 --> 10:22.887
Right, French.

10:23.103 --> 10:26.037
You know half of O.C. speaks Spanish and we're learning how to order 
"baguettes"?

10:26.503 --> 10:29.120
- Okay, someone's in a mood.
- No, I'm not.

10:33.520 --> 10:36.953
Look, it wasn't supposed to happen like this. I was supposed to have sex 
first.

10:37.187 --> 10:41.487
- What are you talking about?
- Cohen. He spent the night at his girlfriend's. They're obviously doing it.

10:41.670 --> 10:44.187
What happens with Seth and Alex has nothing to do with you and Zach.

10:44.537 --> 10:47.946
I know, but I always thought that I would have sex first, and that Cohen 
would catch syphilis on a public toilet.

10:48.041 --> 10:50.651
You can't rush it. You have to wait till you're ready.

10:52.129 --> 10:55.596
You know what, Coop? You are right.
You want to know what I just realized?

10:55.996 --> 10:58.496
That Zach and I are ready.
Man, are we ready.

10:58.779 --> 11:02.062
- Maybe we should take a break.
- What's French for "Let's have sex"?

11:02.236 --> 11:07.403
"Voulez"... "poulet"... something or other?
I mean, why don't they ever teach us anything we can use?

11:12.530 --> 11:15.880
- Seth says you're grounded, huh?
- I'm surprised they even let you in.

11:16.047 --> 11:18.664
Well, I promised I'm only here to study.

11:21.994 --> 11:25.094
- Which, we're here to do.
- Right, right. Study, got it.

11:32.990 --> 11:34.840
Yep, study.

11:35.156 --> 11:38.273
So, look, not that we were wrong to punish them, but

11:38.490 --> 11:41.373
maybe we're handling this in the wrong way.

11:42.240 --> 11:45.757
Post-grounding guilt?
You're such a convincing hard ass,

11:46.373 --> 11:50.756
- but deep down, you're such a softy.
- Well, if all we do is send them to their rooms to do their homework,

11:50.890 --> 11:53.240
- what are they going to learn?
- Their homework.

11:53.623 --> 11:55.440
Well, if as parents,

11:55.706 --> 11:59.390
we're supposed to be setting a good example, how can we do that if they're 
not even in the same room with us?

11:59.706 --> 12:03.957
- So you want to cancel this weekend?
- Or maybe we could log some quality parent-child time right now.

12:04.173 --> 12:06.239
- Watching TV?
- Why not?

12:08.406 --> 12:11.448
It's Bill O'Reilly.
That'll be punishment enough.

12:12.006 --> 12:13.939
Let me get Seth.

12:15.739 --> 12:18.923
All right, I know I sent you off to start serving time...

12:23.340 --> 12:25.023
You've got to be kidding me.

12:30.106 --> 12:33.040
I'm really starting to get the hang of this physics thing.

12:33.306 --> 12:36.440
Mmm. Objects in motion stay in motion?

12:45.071 --> 12:46.870
Oh, my God.

12:51.546 --> 12:54.646
We can't leave the boys alone.
We have to cancel.

12:54.812 --> 12:56.529
Oh, we deserve this weekend.

12:56.679 --> 13:01.362
Believe me, after the lecture I gave Seth last night, he won't open another 
window again, much less climb out of one.

13:01.529 --> 13:05.146
Seth? I'm more preoccupied with Ryan and my sister.

13:05.412 --> 13:08.785
Well, I understand, but we cannot fight a war on multiple fronts.

13:08.912 --> 13:11.545
Have we learned nothing from the Nazis?

13:12.445 --> 13:14.245
- Good morning.
- Morning.

13:14.412 --> 13:16.730
- Who wants blueberry pancakes?
- Banana?

13:16.979 --> 13:20.079
- Or if you're feeling sinful, chocolate chip.
- Not going to happen.

13:20.195 --> 13:22.462
- Too little too late.
- Nice try.
- No way.

13:22.562 --> 13:26.095
- I wanted to tell you about Lindsay.
- You were too busy studying.
Believe me, I saw.

13:26.362 --> 13:27.929
Ouch. Tag out.

13:28.095 --> 13:32.279
Okay, Dad. First of all, I'm really sorry. And now I know you're not going 
to believe this, but...

13:32.469 --> 13:36.569
- You were doing chin-ups on the windowsill, right?
- He's good. Tag in.

13:37.036 --> 13:39.352
You trusted us, we lied to you.
There's no excuse.

13:39.452 --> 13:44.110
- So we just want you to know that whatever punishment you decide on we're 
fine with
- Absolutely.

13:44.427 --> 13:48.749
You guys have no idea how badly you screwed up. No more apologies.
No more pancakes.

13:49.049 --> 13:51.215
You come straight home after school.
Capisce?

13:51.532 --> 13:55.251
Yeah, but about the pancakes, we still have a batch going on...

13:56.999 --> 13:58.432
Capisce.

14:02.986 --> 14:06.186
- We can't leave them alone.
- Oh, so we get punished, too?

14:06.419 --> 14:10.336
Give me the day to deal with this.
Put some bars on the window.
I'll find out what's really going on.

14:10.486 --> 14:13.052
Well, I found out enough last night.

14:13.203 --> 14:16.586
Honey, we're going to celebrate our anniversary.

14:16.886 --> 14:19.586
And the kids are not getting in the way.

14:30.552 --> 14:32.352
Marissa, honey, wait, please.

14:32.452 --> 14:35.925
- I'm late for school.
- I just wanted to remind you about the photo shoot tomorrow.

14:35.975 --> 14:38.041
- Great, still not coming.
- Marissa, honey...

14:40.041 --> 14:44.758
Look, I know things haven't been very easy around here, everything with 
Caleb and

14:45.141 --> 14:51.041
your father leaving, but this is the only family we have, and I really want 
it to work, and not just for the photo shoot.

14:52.058 --> 14:55.674
- You know, maybe we should take that trip to Puerto Vallarta.
- So now you're bribing me?

14:55.808 --> 14:57.274
Does that mean you'll be there?

14:58.491 --> 15:01.791
You know what? Sure. I'll even bring DJ.

15:02.491 --> 15:05.774
He's not even our yard guy anymore. You understand this is a portrait of our 
lives?

15:05.874 --> 15:09.607
And DJ is a part of my life. So, I'll see if he's free and we'll get back to 
you.

15:13.907 --> 15:18.707
I am so sorry I ran away.
I should have stayed and apologized.

15:18.990 --> 15:23.723
No, be happy you took off.
Besides, it's my fault anyway.
I kind of knew we weren't going to study.

15:23.890 --> 15:27.290
We both knew we weren't going to study.

15:27.456 --> 15:30.473
You at least had honorable intentions.

15:30.556 --> 15:33.590
- Towards Kirsten, not me.
- Right.

15:35.523 --> 15:37.973
Well, at least she knows, right?

15:38.156 --> 15:43.072
- Probably just needs a little time to get used to it.
- How much time are we talking about?

15:44.618 --> 15:48.952
I'll, I'll talk to her. I need to talk to her. I mean, after all, we're 
sisters.

15:49.268 --> 15:51.835
Yeah, that's kind of the problem.

15:57.892 --> 16:02.108
Hey, look, the manager is not here right now, but he has all the permits, 
so...

16:02.292 --> 16:05.108
I'm not the cops. Much worse.

16:06.431 --> 16:09.597
- I'm Seth's dad.
- That is worse.

16:09.997 --> 16:14.581
I came to apologize for keeping Seth from sneaking out of the house to see 
you last night.

16:14.847 --> 16:17.614
It's a terrible thing leaving you hanging like that.

16:19.213 --> 16:21.863
- You want me to stop seeing him,
don't you?
- Yeah.

16:23.096 --> 16:28.913
But seeing how he's a teenage boy and you've got tattoos and run a 
rock'n'roll club, I'm not expecting any miracles.

16:29.646 --> 16:34.647
- So what is this, a warning?
- Whoa, you're a little edgy around figures of authority, aren't you?

16:35.246 --> 16:37.629
Hey, there's no bar nuts.

16:37.929 --> 16:41.023
- What kind of joint is this?
- I'll get right on it.

16:41.479 --> 16:46.146
You're a bartender. You listen to people's problems. Hear mine.

16:48.115 --> 16:51.515
This is my 20th anniversary.
Or it's supposed to be.

16:51.665 --> 16:54.365
It's not going so well. Now...

16:55.015 --> 16:57.381
my wife is convinced she can't leave Seth alone.

16:57.681 --> 16:59.898
- You need me to baby-sit?
- Cute.

17:00.964 --> 17:04.348
- You think I'm corrupting him?
- I think you're a smart girl

17:05.647 --> 17:09.306
and I think he'll listen to you. More than he's going to listen to his 
parents right now.

17:14.500 --> 17:17.383
No dad has ever asked me to straighten out his son before.

17:17.950 --> 17:22.532
I really don't like going behind his back,
but I think sometimes in order to be a good dad, you've got to be a bad guy.

17:28.521 --> 17:31.155
I don't have much experience with good dads.

17:31.471 --> 17:35.321
Llisten, you stop over at the house anytime. Kirsten and I will be very 
happy to ground you, too.

17:46.205 --> 17:47.522
Hi.

17:49.122 --> 17:50.605
Hello.

17:51.072 --> 17:53.822
So, I have been thinking.

17:54.022 --> 17:56.189
Maybe we could do something tonight.

17:56.339 --> 17:59.455
Just you and I, alone.

17:59.722 --> 18:03.079
I've got to pick up my sister from the airport tonight.

18:03.205 --> 18:04.905
Why, is she handicapped or something?

18:05.055 --> 18:08.589
No, she's just... she's been out of the country. I haven't seen her for, 
like, a year.

18:09.289 --> 18:10.939
Got it.

18:11.139 --> 18:16.155
Well, so, anyways, we've been dating for a few months now,

18:16.305 --> 18:18.205
and I really like you.

18:18.538 --> 18:21.072
- Cool, I like you, too.
- Cool.

18:21.188 --> 18:24.188
Well, I was thinking maybe we could take this to the next step.

18:24.855 --> 18:28.645
You're totally right, Summer. I've actually been thinking about it for a 
while. I just, I didn't want to rush.

18:28.738 --> 18:31.952
- Well, let's rush.
- Okay, then. Uh, this weekend?

18:32.098 --> 18:35.995
- This weekend is per-fect.
- Good. I'll call my parents and let them know.

18:36.738 --> 18:39.191
Wow, you really keep your parents informed?

18:39.485 --> 18:42.858
If they're going to be meeting my girlfriend, I think they should probably 
know.

18:43.405 --> 18:46.632
And this works perfectly with Abigail being back in town.

18:47.018 --> 18:49.512
So, like, lunch tomorrow?

18:49.885 --> 18:52.778
Great. This is going to be great.

18:53.458 --> 18:55.312
Yeah, it's nice.

18:55.457 --> 18:57.817
"But down here  I believe"

18:58.364 --> 19:02.297
"That I made a big deal with a girl that can't bleed"

19:02.724 --> 19:05.831
"Now I see Red and black..."

19:07.591 --> 19:08.964
Hello.

19:09.178 --> 19:12.911
I'm here for my after school tutorial in the art of getting...

19:13.591 --> 19:15.898
Is this the advanced class?

19:16.591 --> 19:18.298
I don't feel good.

19:20.684 --> 19:25.511
All right. Maybe my magic hands can be of service.

19:29.782 --> 19:32.289
- What are we doing?
- I call this part prepping the oven.

19:32.382 --> 19:34.662
No. What are we doing in the larger sense?

19:36.475 --> 19:40.848
- Did something happen?
- Your parents are worried about you.

19:41.062 --> 19:43.902
My parents? How would you even know about...

19:46.553 --> 19:50.019
- Did my dad come by the club?
- Your dad stopped by the club.

19:54.349 --> 19:56.749
That's embarrassing!

19:58.896 --> 20:03.097
I've never listened to my own parents. Suddenly I feel compelled to listen 
to yours.

20:04.176 --> 20:06.789
Sandy Cohen has that effect on people.

20:12.253 --> 20:15.026
- So you're going to need some space.
- I'm going to need some space.

20:15.279 --> 20:17.693
Yep, probably a little time.

20:18.346 --> 20:20.439
Definitely some time.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.781
- I'm sorry.
- Cool.

20:23.941 --> 20:26.155
But tell your parents Happy Anniversary.

20:33.103 --> 20:37.236
The cars got a full tank of gas and tomorrow we can head right out.

20:37.596 --> 20:40.156
- You can't be serious.
- The boys will be fine at Caleb's.

20:40.289 --> 20:43.596
I talked to Seth's girlfriend. She's a bit of a character, but she seems 
like a good kid.

20:43.729 --> 20:45.902
Is that why Seth isn't home yet?

20:46.102 --> 20:49.102
I'm not letting the boys stay with Julie Cooper, but they can't be left 
alone.

20:49.209 --> 20:52.209
Honey, they're teenagers. They like girls.

20:52.622 --> 20:56.076
- One of which happens to be my sister.
- So what, we're gonna forbid them?

20:56.187 --> 20:58.237
Well, not you. You wouldn't forbid them anything.

20:58.300 --> 21:01.199
You're too busy being their best friend. I'm the one that has to enforce all 
the rules.

21:01.320 --> 21:04.170
I've never done more grounding than I have in the last 24 hours.

21:04.330 --> 21:07.202
- Who let Seth run away to Portland?
- What, we're talking about this now?

21:07.330 --> 21:08.910
And who went up there and told him he could stay?

21:08.975 --> 21:12.103
It's a good thing I did. If I let you drag him home, we could have lost him 
forever.

21:12.189 --> 21:16.673
That's why this is happening. Because he thinks he can do whatever he wants, 
and you'll just keep me from coming down on him.

21:16.833 --> 21:19.769
You think somebody can stop you from coming down on somebody?

21:19.951 --> 21:24.106
Right, and I should find it adorable that you forgot our anniversary!

21:29.585 --> 21:31.528
Could we please talk about this later?

21:31.710 --> 21:34.255
We have all weekend.
I canceled the reservations.

21:46.087 --> 21:48.339
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey. Come-come on.

21:50.016 --> 21:51.767
Let's do this thing.

21:54.531 --> 21:56.859
So what's going on with you?

21:57.595 --> 22:00.179
Where'd this Bizarro Seth come from?

22:00.553 --> 22:02.709
Nice comic book reference.

22:02.944 --> 22:05.048
Please. So...

22:07.247 --> 22:09.532
you spent the night at this girl's house.

22:11.293 --> 22:12.777
Are you having sex?

22:13.066 --> 22:17.955
No, Dad. You don't have to worry about that ever happening now that you 
showed up at the club and worked your magic.

22:18.467 --> 22:21.019
I'm sorry, but you left me no choice.

22:21.702 --> 22:24.264
- What did we do? Are you angry at us?
- No.

22:25.517 --> 22:27.267
Then it's about the girl?

22:27.449 --> 22:30.246
I just, you know, whenever I'm around her,
I feel like I constantly

22:30.311 --> 22:33.173
have to prove to her that I deserve to be around her.

22:33.343 --> 22:35.799
Even if it's at the expense of your parents' relationship?

22:40.874 --> 22:42.444
Come on in here. Join the party.

22:46.661 --> 22:48.999
The last time I checked in with you,

22:49.373 --> 22:51.754
you and Lindsay were headed into the friend zone.

22:52.149 --> 22:54.754
- We were.
- You lied to us.

22:55.224 --> 22:56.911
I know, and I'm sorry.

22:57.081 --> 23:01.377
Well, you know what? I'm afraid it's a little late for apologies. From any 
of us.

23:02.343 --> 23:05.710
My wedding anniversary weekend is...
officially ruined.

23:08.126 --> 23:10.843
How can we help?

23:14.670 --> 23:16.637
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:17.270 --> 23:20.987
I called your house and Sandy said you might be here.

23:21.503 --> 23:23.772
I had some work to finish.

23:24.020 --> 23:25.536
Right. Right.

23:29.453 --> 23:30.670
I'm sorry.

23:31.820 --> 23:35.187
You know, Ryan and I started seeing each other before I found out about 
everything,

23:35.237 --> 23:39.270
and then it all happened so fast and it was a lot.

23:41.354 --> 23:44.037
- I never wanted to upset you.
- I know.

23:44.787 --> 23:49.070
- And I probably overreacted.
- No, it... was embarrassing.

23:51.247 --> 23:55.131
Maybe you and I need to take some time.

23:56.797 --> 24:01.564
Accepting Ryan into my home as my son was a huge deal for me.

24:02.547 --> 24:08.059
And taking you in as my sister, which I am thrilled about, it's just 
complicated.

24:09.314 --> 24:12.431
So, you... you don't want me seeing Ryan?

24:12.581 --> 24:14.114
I would never say that.

24:14.348 --> 24:18.914
- It's just that while you're seeing him, maybe we should take a step back.
- A step back?

24:19.881 --> 24:22.631
So, does that mean we're like cousins now?

24:24.798 --> 24:29.515
- Maybe we should be friends.
- Friends.

24:33.581 --> 24:36.676
Great... Bye.

24:40.614 --> 24:44.214
- I'm not nervous, so you're not nervous, right?
- I'm so not nervous. Dads love me.

24:44.314 --> 24:47.881
Oh, my dad couldn't make it. He got held up in D.C. on some assault weapons 
ban.

24:49.883 --> 24:52.000
Hey, Mom, Abby.

24:54.496 --> 24:58.100
- This is Summer.
- Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you.
Zach's told us so much about you.

24:58.329 --> 25:00.371
Oh, all lies, I'm sure.

25:01.820 --> 25:05.424
- All I was trying to say, Mother...
- Abby, I don't think this is the time.

25:05.528 --> 25:08.341
- I don't think Summer would be interested
- Oh, no, Summer's interested.

25:08.570 --> 25:11.091
Please, whatever you were chatting about, continue. I'm a listener.

25:11.278 --> 25:14.508
I was saying that what's happening in Kashmir just shows us how countries 
can be...

25:14.716 --> 25:19.840
I know, cashmeres this season were just so cute. I don't go anywhere without 
my cashmere purse.

25:20.007 --> 25:25.257
- Summer, they're, uh...
- No, Kashmir, as in the disputed region between India and Pakistan.

25:26.111 --> 25:28.944
They fought three wars over it.

25:31.194 --> 25:33.757
Yes, yes, totally Kashmir.

25:35.153 --> 25:36.944
- I agree.
- "I agree" with what?

25:38.432 --> 25:41.265
- What?
- What she means, dear, is what do you agree with?

25:41.411 --> 25:46.557
Do you think the Indians should cede Kashmir to the Pakistanis or should 
remain an independent state?

25:47.390 --> 25:49.869
Oh... yeah, tough call.

25:51.265 --> 25:53.515
Two sides to every story.

25:58.202 --> 26:02.223
You know, you are just so tan.
Zach, here, tells me you study abroad.

26:02.577 --> 26:05.202
In Saint Bart's, perhaps?
I hear the Four Seasons there is amazing.

26:05.389 --> 26:08.618
I was building an irrigation system in a village in Southern India.

26:13.829 --> 26:16.141
- Maybe we should order.
- Lovely.

26:19.558 --> 26:22.100
This is your concept of time and space?

26:22.350 --> 26:24.767
Oh, don't flatter yourself.
I'm here on official business.

26:24.933 --> 26:26.871
And what business would that be?

26:27.142 --> 26:29.683
- I would like my job back.
- No.

26:30.725 --> 26:33.038
Listen, the folks, they're a little bit
mad at me

26:33.767 --> 26:38.169
And needless to say, my allowance has been impacted. Now, I don't want to 
have to start tightening my belt.

26:38.663 --> 26:41.621
I don't want to have to give up the vacation homes, the Porshe, the...

26:41.788 --> 26:44.205
You're really tugging at my heartstrings here.

26:45.059 --> 26:46.969
- Look, I get why you're upset.
- No, I think you don't.

26:47.330 --> 26:50.830
- Because my dad broke up with you for me?
- Okay, now I know you don't.

26:51.892 --> 26:53.497
You don't realize how lucky you are.

26:53.663 --> 26:56.823
- That my dad showed up and humiliated me?
- That he showed up at all?

26:56.996 --> 27:01.330
That he cares that there's something wrong and his first reaction isn't just 
to throw you out of the house?

27:07.606 --> 27:09.640
It still pays minimum wage.

27:09.723 --> 27:12.273
You know where the bathrooms are.

27:13.440 --> 27:14.623
Are there any other perks?

27:16.490 --> 27:20.923
What's the point, Seth? It's not like they're ever gonna approve of me.

27:22.807 --> 27:27.141
Maybe there's a way we can show them you're not so bad.

27:28.374 --> 27:29.524
Smile.

27:32.107 --> 27:34.957
What is taking so long?
He's not painting our portrait.

27:36.524 --> 27:39.307
My face is gonna freeze in this position unless you push the button.

27:39.407 --> 27:42.457
Cal, this photograph is going to be seen by everyone in Newport Beach.

27:42.574 --> 27:45.557
- You don't want frown lines.
- Okay, if you can all smile.

27:45.740 --> 27:47.090
I am smiling, damn it.

27:48.757 --> 27:50.290
Oh, wait a second.

27:51.874 --> 27:54.065
- Sorry I'm late.
- Oh, my God.

27:54.449 --> 27:57.532
He's come to mow the lawn?
Can't he reschedule?

27:57.901 --> 27:59.501
Oh, I'll handle this.

27:59.635 --> 28:03.224
Handle what? Tell him to come back tomorrow. And check for poison oak.

28:04.454 --> 28:07.334
- What is he doing here?
- I thought you said she was cool with this.

28:07.734 --> 28:11.454
- You must be joking.
- Look, either DJ's in the photo or I'm out. It's up to you.

28:12.987 --> 28:16.027
- Now, you know, I'll save you the hard choice. I'm leaving.
- Works for me.

28:16.280 --> 28:17.880
Thanks a lot.

28:19.640 --> 28:23.439
- You can forget your photo shoot. DJ wait.
- Don't. I'll go.

28:23.734 --> 28:26.640
If having him here means we get our picture taken, I'll bring him back.

28:27.214 --> 28:30.400
- Like he'll listen to you.
- Well, considering I'm not the one who lied to him,

28:30.747 --> 28:32.973
I think I have a better shot than you.

28:39.134 --> 28:41.321
DJ, wait up.

28:42.641 --> 28:44.067
What, you need some hedges trimmed?

28:44.574 --> 28:46.683
Don't be so self-deprecating.

28:46.841 --> 28:50.808
- I wanted to thank you for not causing more of a scene back there.
- Oh, save the act, Mrs. Cooper.

28:51.008 --> 28:52.684
I know you hate me being with Marissa.

28:52.884 --> 28:56.098
It's Mrs. Cooper Nichol, and you're damn right, I do.

28:56.324 --> 29:00.391
You know, the Nichol on the end of my name allows me to write you a check 
with a few zeros on the end of it.

29:00.857 --> 29:04.417
- What are you talking about?
- What do you say, five grand, never to see my daughter again?

29:04.937 --> 29:09.097
How do you spell your last name?
Never mind, you can fill that part out.

29:09.337 --> 29:11.350
You're unbelievable.

29:12.171 --> 29:13.997
I'm doing you a favor, honey.

29:14.544 --> 29:17.317
You and I both know Marissa is just using you to get back at me.

29:17.424 --> 29:19.051
What do you think today was all about?

29:19.451 --> 29:22.258
It only seems fair you should get something out of this relationship, too.

29:36.579 --> 29:37.765
What's going on?

29:40.232 --> 29:43.376
Okay, you tell me your news,
'cause, then, I have some.

29:43.559 --> 29:45.863
- Oh, yeah? You want to go first?
- No.

29:46.042 --> 29:49.582
You picked this very important meeting at the pier, so you get the honors.

29:52.386 --> 29:54.776
It's just... us.

29:58.679 --> 30:01.869
It's causing problems for Kirsten and Sandy

30:03.560 --> 30:07.539
And I just... I can't do that to them.
I owe them too much, you know?

30:08.808 --> 30:10.962
I just... think we should take some time...

30:12.712 --> 30:15.667
space for... a while. Be friends.

30:17.309 --> 30:18.525
Great.

30:19.965 --> 30:25.213
Two hours ago I had a sister and a boyfriend, and now all I have are 
friends.

30:26.397 --> 30:27.805
Oh, wait, what?

30:29.980 --> 30:32.828
Before I came here,
I talked to Kirsten and she asked me,

30:32.935 --> 30:37.441
without asking me, to choose between a sister and a boyfriend.

30:39.079 --> 30:43.143
And... genius that I am...

30:45.491 --> 30:46.825
I chose you.

30:48.591 --> 30:53.808
Had I known that you had this whole time space plan, I might have chosen 
differently

30:53.908 --> 30:56.741
- I didn't know, I'm sorry.
- Ah, yeah, you're sorry.

30:57.041 --> 31:01.175
Cool, 'cause...
that really fixes absolutely nothing.

31:03.225 --> 31:04.991
I've got to go.

31:05.308 --> 31:07.758
"This probably won't work out"

31:07.891 --> 31:10.608
"We might not live forever"

31:20.530 --> 31:22.613
Oh, there she is!

31:23.063 --> 31:25.713
All day I've been looking for this beautiful woman.

31:26.521 --> 31:29.288
- Happy Anniversary.
- Happy Anniversary.

31:29.621 --> 31:32.471
- So, come on. Let's go, let's get ready.
- Get ready for what?

31:32.588 --> 31:35.988
My dear, maybe you've forgotten, but it's our 20th anniversary, and I'm 
taking you to the Arches.

31:36.138 --> 31:40.504
- You've got to be kidding.
- I know what you're worried about. Never fear, I've hired some 
baby-sitters.

31:41.270 --> 31:44.337
Fellas! Joe, Tim.

31:45.454 --> 31:49.304
Two of Orange County's finest. We've been friends since I worked the P.D.'s 
office.

31:49.537 --> 31:52.214
Evening, Mrs. Cohen.
Your boys will be safe with us.

31:52.547 --> 31:53.530
Happy Anniversary.

32:02.403 --> 32:04.770
My rib eye is excellent. How's your turbot?

32:05.220 --> 32:07.403
- Fine.
- Just fine?

32:08.253 --> 32:10.553
- Too fishy? Send it back if you want.
- Sandy.

32:10.670 --> 32:11.820
- Send it back.
- Sandy.

32:11.953 --> 32:16.837
All right, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. All I wanted was to give you a special 
evening...

32:18.206 --> 32:19.640
and some turbot that wasn't too fishy.

32:20.856 --> 32:22.240
I know.

32:24.290 --> 32:27.040
I'm sorry I brought up Portland last night.

32:27.490 --> 32:29.173
That wasn't your fault.

32:29.290 --> 32:32.757
It's just Seth is growing up so fast and...

32:33.407 --> 32:35.257
I don't want to lose him.

32:36.573 --> 32:39.796
Let's stop apologizing, okay?
Let's just enjoy ourselves.

32:40.140 --> 32:44.806
Look on the bright side. We got all of this out of our system before 
Valentine's Day.

32:47.454 --> 32:48.838
- Oh, no.
- Oh, God.

32:50.604 --> 32:54.754
I don't know how they did it, Sandy, but we went outside for a second. They 
were gone.

32:56.571 --> 32:57.121
Check.

32:57.655 --> 33:02.775
(REPORTER on TV)

33:04.362 --> 33:09.082
I cannot believe what Chirac said to the farmer's union. You go, Jacques.

33:10.962 --> 33:12.455
The Economist?

33:12.695 --> 33:14.042
The Nation?

33:14.495 --> 33:18.042
- The New Republic? What are you doing?
- I'm informing myself, Coop.

33:18.442 --> 33:21.069
It's impossible. There is so much news.

33:21.282 --> 33:23.791
You know, the worst part is, it is constantly changing.

33:24.095 --> 33:27.939
If everything could just stop for, like,
one day, maybe I could catch up.

33:28.139 --> 33:31.371
You should just call him back.
He's left you four messages since lunch.

33:31.556 --> 33:34.056
If Zach wants to dump me, he can do it in person.

33:34.539 --> 33:39.140
At least Zach's calling you. I haven't heard from DJ since the photo shoot 
incident

33:39.456 --> 33:42.989
- You mean since your mother spoke to him?
- Exactly, and who knows what she said.

33:43.622 --> 33:46.476
I left him a message to meet us.
I'm really getting worried.

33:46.605 --> 33:49.622
Well, I'm past the point of worrying.
I'm resigned to my fate.

33:49.939 --> 33:53.705
- The lunch can't have been that bad.
- Remember how lunch went with my dad and Cohen?

33:54.122 --> 33:57.222
Well, compared to my performance today, Cohen came off like Kofi Annan.

33:57.339 --> 34:01.022
- Who's Kofi Annan?
- Some guy Zach's mom knows.
I think he works for United Airlines.

34:06.223 --> 34:08.239
I can't believe you talked me into leaving them.

34:08.373 --> 34:10.656
Excuse me for wanting to celebrate my 20th anniversary.

34:10.739 --> 34:13.906
- How do you know where they are?
- A hunch. Hey, fellas, let's pick it up?

34:14.373 --> 34:15.822
You got it, Sandy.

34:30.001 --> 34:31.684
Thanks, Tim.

34:35.013 --> 34:39.380
Everything they said to us, feeling sorry, wanting to reform, all lies.

34:39.679 --> 34:43.679
- No more Mr. Nice Guy.
- So now you admit that you were
Mr. Nice Guy?

34:46.112 --> 34:50.312
Don't make this about me. We show a united front, we show no mercy.

34:50.495 --> 34:53.362
If he wants bad, I can be bad,

34:53.828 --> 34:55.411
but first...

34:55.811 --> 34:58.595
Surprise!

35:02.261 --> 35:05.328
- You planned all this?
- I prefer the term "orchestrated."

35:05.728 --> 35:10.652
So, we're here tonight to celebrate the marriage of Sandy and Kirsten Cohen.

35:12.235 --> 35:15.018
We all owe them so much, I think,

35:15.302 --> 35:17.868
because, if they were never married,
then they never would have had me,

35:17.952 --> 35:20.618
and think of what all you people would be missing out on.

35:20.735 --> 35:22.168
Now... That's touching.

35:22.285 --> 35:26.685
So, we'd like to take a moment and say thanks for everything.

35:27.818 --> 35:30.085
And apologize for everything.

35:30.385 --> 35:34.001
Because here's the thing. The fact that your marriage can survive the two of 
us,

35:35.001 --> 35:38.018
is truly inspiring, and it gets me here.

35:38.651 --> 35:40.718
To Sandy and Kirsten.

35:46.481 --> 35:49.031
So now for the evening's main attraction...

35:49.347 --> 35:51.197
Yeah, I don't know how many of you people know this,

35:51.297 --> 35:55.947
but back in the day, Sandy Cohen could cut a pretty sweet tune.

35:56.180 --> 36:01.547
In fact, he actually was Danny Zuko in the
original U.C. Berkeley production of Grease

36:01.630 --> 36:05.363
- You're not going up there.
- Baby, I'm gone.

36:05.513 --> 36:08.865
So now, appearing live at the Bait Shop,
one night only...

36:09.080 --> 36:12.163
Sandy Cohen and the News.

36:15.159 --> 36:18.976
Well, first of all, before we start,
I want to thank my kids,

36:19.176 --> 36:20.242
Seth and Ryan,

36:20.376 --> 36:23.759
and a new friend of the family, without whom none of this would be possible,

36:24.026 --> 36:26.526
I want to thank Alex.

36:27.614 --> 36:30.330
Well, I guess, we ought to start, fellas.

36:31.230 --> 36:33.730
I'd like to dedicate this song to the love of my life

36:34.014 --> 36:37.280
and I hope maybe in another 20 years, she might forgive me for this.

36:39.234 --> 36:41.418
"If I fall short"

36:43.701 --> 36:46.301
"If I don't make the grade"

36:48.596 --> 36:51.863
"If your expectations aren't met in me"

36:52.579 --> 36:54.479
"Today"

36:56.346 --> 36:59.898
"There's always tomorrow"

37:00.946 --> 37:04.079
"Or tomorrow night"

37:06.062 --> 37:08.179
"Hang in there, baby"

37:08.812 --> 37:10.562
"Sooner or later"

37:11.329 --> 37:13.945
"I know I'll get it right"

37:15.812 --> 37:18.377
"Please don't give up on me..."

37:18.745 --> 37:19.745
There you are.

37:19.979 --> 37:24.162
I'm reading about these attacks on the Hungarian minority in Serbia.

37:25.741 --> 37:27.958
I think I know what's going on here.

37:29.141 --> 37:30.641
What?

37:30.824 --> 37:34.374
That you are breaking up with me because you and your family think I'm an 
idiot?

37:34.991 --> 37:37.408
Summer, there's lots of ways to be smart.

37:37.541 --> 37:41.658
It's not just about knowing Kuala Lumpur is the capital of Indonesia,

37:41.983 --> 37:44.912
and I like you because you're different from my family.

37:46.283 --> 37:48.666
Then you must like me a whole lot.

37:49.800 --> 37:54.370
"I know... I know I was wrong, wrong"

37:54.567 --> 37:56.500
Yeah, I do.

37:57.183 --> 37:59.117
"I'd like to make amends..."

37:59.367 --> 38:01.911
Just so you know Jakarta is the capital of Indonesia.

38:02.117 --> 38:07.517
"The love that I never, ever shown just won't give up on me"

38:09.186 --> 38:11.119
"Every word is true"

38:11.586 --> 38:14.069
Marissa? Look, I know why you're down,

38:14.836 --> 38:17.719
- but the truth is, you are better off.
- What are you talking about?

38:17.886 --> 38:21.369
- You don't even know him.
- I know that I offered him $5,000

38:21.503 --> 38:25.153
as a test  to stay away, and he took it.

38:25.821 --> 38:29.021
I just think you should know what he's really like, honey.

38:33.521 --> 38:36.931
"I know it's late"

38:38.371 --> 38:42.004
"Late in the game"

38:43.802 --> 38:45.919
"But my feelings"

38:46.336 --> 38:48.202
"My true feelings"

38:48.369 --> 38:50.169
"Haven't changed..."

38:50.319 --> 38:53.086
- I'm really sorry that I freaked out.
- We should have told you.

38:53.969 --> 38:57.802
It's a difficult situation.
I barely understand it myself.

38:58.335 --> 39:01.110
Look, she's great. I like her,

39:01.226 --> 39:03.643
but more than anything, you two should be friends.

39:05.010 --> 39:10.660
We will, but right now I think you two should go and dance.

39:10.826 --> 39:13.460
"...that I've never, ever shown"

39:13.826 --> 39:16.878
"Just won't give up on me..."

39:17.276 --> 39:19.943
"Every word is true"

39:21.926 --> 39:25.226
I wasn't going to come. Seth called me and

39:25.576 --> 39:27.142
I'm... glad you did,

39:29.326 --> 39:35.709
and I'm sorry about before. I'm over the time-space plan. That's a bad, bad 
plan.

39:38.159 --> 39:39.743
What about?

39:40.226 --> 39:44.326
She wanted me to ask you...

39:46.576 --> 39:48.859
..if you wanted to dance with me.

39:49.042 --> 39:50.742
"I don't want you to"

39:51.892 --> 39:54.026
"I know it's late"

39:54.509 --> 40:00.609
"Oh, wait... please, please,"

40:01.792 --> 40:04.459
"Don't give up on me"
- He sounds good?

40:04.641 --> 40:06.991
- You know you've created a monster.
- Yeah, I do.

40:07.141 --> 40:09.507
There's somebody I want you to meet.

40:10.591 --> 40:13.482
- Oh, hi. I'm Kirsten.
- Alex.

40:14.599 --> 40:17.832
- Thank you so much for the party.
- Oh, no problem, really.
This is the least I could do.

40:18.199 --> 40:22.091
- That's true... Lovely tattoo.
- Thank you.

40:24.158 --> 40:27.624
Your husband rocks, by the way. I mean, wow.

40:27.774 --> 40:30.458
Well, please don't tell him that.

40:32.258 --> 40:35.091
"Oh, hold on, baby..."

40:37.408 --> 40:39.441
"Please..."

40:43.020 --> 40:45.686
"Don't give up on me"

40:55.009 --> 40:57.809
- Where have you been?
I've been calling you all day.
- I know.

40:59.042 --> 41:01.342
I've been thinking, and

41:02.859 --> 41:04.552
I can't do this anymore, I'm sorry.

41:08.436 --> 41:13.231
- So you took the money.
- No, but that doesn't change anything.

41:13.503 --> 41:17.736
- I know you're upset, but please, don't let my mom be the reason.
- Marissa, this isn't about your mom.

41:18.170 --> 41:20.536
- You can't blame her for everything.
- But it's her fault.

41:20.809 --> 41:22.843
I mean, if she wasn't against us, then there wouldn't be...

41:22.893 --> 41:25.326
Then you probably wouldn't have dated me in the first place.

41:27.243 --> 41:31.801
I'm not saying you didn't like me.
Just... not as much as you hate her.

41:38.325 --> 41:41.825
- I'm sorry.
- Why? We had fun.

41:46.891 --> 41:51.375
She left it blank. So why don't you go on a shopping spree on her?

42:00.416 --> 42:03.966
- You take care, okay?
- Yeah, you, too.

42:16.700 --> 42:19.369
"And I can't remember"

42:19.923 --> 42:21.713
"How I met her"

42:22.006 --> 42:26.410
"Seems like she's always just been hanging on my arm"

42:27.313 --> 42:30.894
"And I can't remember How I ever"

42:31.773 --> 42:37.111
"Oh, thought that I could live without her woman's charms"

42:37.339 --> 42:42.158
"She loves to lie beside me
Almost every night"

42:42.678 --> 42:47.366
"Well, she's no lady, she's my wife"

42:47.919 --> 42:55.236
"She's no lady"

42:56.929 --> 43:01.910
"she's my wife."
