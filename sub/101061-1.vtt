MAN CAN DO WHAT HE WILLS,
BUT HE CANNOT WILL WHAT HE WILLS.

00:22.375 --> 00:23.708
<i>If we knew</i>

00:24.375 --> 00:26.333
<i>how things would end...</i>

00:28.000 --> 00:30.958
<i>where our journey would take us...</i>

00:33.125 --> 00:37.458
<i>would we still make the same decisions?</i>

00:39.625 --> 00:42.916
<i>Or would we choose a different path?</i>

00:46.166 --> 00:49.625
<i>Could we even escape our fate?</i>

00:54.208 --> 00:58.000
<i>Or would what is deep within us</i>

00:58.666 --> 01:00.541
<i>lead us to the same end,</i>

01:01.000 --> 01:03.083
<i>like an invisible hand?</i>

01:09.500 --> 01:12.458
<i>Does it matter which path we choose</i>

01:13.166 --> 01:15.541
<i>if we end up</i>

01:16.458 --> 01:18.708
<i>facing ourselves again and again?</i>

05:23.833 --> 05:25.875
Wait. Martha, that's not possible, I...

05:25.958 --> 05:28.166
-I don't understand.
-We don't have time.

05:38.333 --> 05:40.083
What time are you from?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.875
The question isn't from what time,

05:44.083 --> 05:45.500
but from what world.

06:06.291 --> 06:07.791
How did we get here?

06:09.958 --> 06:11.791
I asked how we got here!

06:13.791 --> 06:14.916
You're not Martha.

06:17.375 --> 06:18.583
Who are you?

06:24.500 --> 06:26.666
Today's the day it all began.

06:28.458 --> 06:30.250
The day we first met.

06:33.791 --> 06:35.500
What's that supposed to mean?

06:40.125 --> 06:41.333
That you and I...

06:43.125 --> 06:44.666
your world and my world...

06:46.666 --> 06:49.583
form a knot
that is inextricably intertwined.

06:51.875 --> 06:52.958
Your world?

06:54.875 --> 06:56.291
What do you mean, your world?

07:03.958 --> 07:05.208
I'll make it right.

07:05.958 --> 07:08.416
-I promise.
-Wait! Where are you going?

07:09.250 --> 07:10.250
Why am I here?

07:25.291 --> 07:30.000
NOVEMBER 4, 2019

08:04.125 --> 08:05.458
Mikkel, put that away.

08:05.916 --> 08:08.958
-Morning.
-No wonder you can't sleep at night.

08:13.750 --> 08:15.250
What's up with him?

08:17.458 --> 08:19.250
The same nightmare he always has.

08:21.791 --> 08:23.250
Mikkel, that's enough.

08:23.625 --> 08:25.250
Maybe it wasn't a dream.

08:26.041 --> 08:29.166
But the here and now is one.
And none of us are real.

08:29.666 --> 08:31.166
Ever thought about that?

08:32.583 --> 08:34.541
Ha-ha! Very funny.

08:37.875 --> 08:39.750
Oh, the damn electricity!

08:41.958 --> 08:43.291
Pass the butter.

08:44.375 --> 08:47.208
Come on, Mikkel. Go get ready now.

08:49.916 --> 08:51.333
The bowl!

08:54.666 --> 08:56.000
Is Magnus up yet?

08:57.958 --> 09:00.500
-Martha, is Magnus up yet?
-No idea.

09:01.500 --> 09:04.333
-Are you nuts?
-I just wanted to see if you were real.

09:04.416 --> 09:05.833
Magnus!

09:08.875 --> 09:09.791
Magnus!

09:09.875 --> 09:11.291
You're going to be late!

09:13.791 --> 09:14.625
Hello!

09:16.666 --> 09:19.583
Magnus, either you get down here
or I'm coming up!

09:21.250 --> 09:23.083
I'll be down in a sec.

10:17.041 --> 10:19.416
-Asshole!
-Race you to school. Morning, Mom.

10:19.500 --> 10:20.833
-Idiot.
-Morning.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.041
Shall I give you a ride?

10:28.083 --> 10:29.458
It's supposed to rain later.

10:29.708 --> 10:32.416
No, I'll be home late today.
Play rehearsal.

10:32.500 --> 10:35.291
Don't forget, starting tomorrow
you guys are at your father's place.

10:39.250 --> 10:40.500
Man, Mom, that sucks.

11:38.333 --> 11:40.041
Good morning, sleepy head.

11:45.291 --> 11:47.875
I was awake half the night again.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.958
Why did it take so long?

11:55.041 --> 11:58.333
First day back at school.
Long line at the baker's.

11:58.750 --> 12:00.458
The apocalypse is coming.

12:06.458 --> 12:07.458
Stay awhile.

12:10.875 --> 12:12.208
I'm running late.

12:14.666 --> 12:16.625
I'll see you this evening, okay?

12:17.000 --> 12:17.958
Ulrich?

12:23.833 --> 12:24.875
I love you.

12:32.041 --> 12:33.125

14:36.375 --> 14:37.875
Welcome back to hell.

14:37.958 --> 14:41.875
Just because you're too pea-brained to see
education is the only way out of this dump

14:41.958 --> 14:44.541
doesn't mean we all share
your retarded opinion.

14:44.625 --> 14:47.500
-Don't forget to breathe.
-Don't forget to think.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.291
-Hey.
-Hey.

14:50.125 --> 14:51.958
-Have you seen Kilian?
-Nope.

14:52.041 --> 14:53.666
Why all the effort?

14:53.750 --> 14:55.291
We all die in the end.

14:55.916 --> 14:58.375
Are you sure you're not adopted?

14:58.458 --> 15:02.500
Are you sure you don't have a stick
up your ass that needs surgical removal?

15:02.583 --> 15:04.208
-Dumbass!
-Dumbass yourself!

15:04.291 --> 15:06.333
-Hey, Martha.
-Kilian.

15:10.208 --> 15:11.916
Is there any news about Erik?

15:12.916 --> 15:13.750
No.

15:15.791 --> 15:17.458
It's all pretty creepy.

15:18.625 --> 15:19.916
<i>Good morning.</i>

15:20.000 --> 15:24.458
<i>We request all grades to gather in the gym</i>
<i>for first-period assembly.</i>

15:24.541 --> 15:26.041
It'll be about your brother.

15:26.250 --> 15:29.375
It's been two weeks already.
He's never been away this long.

15:29.750 --> 15:31.083
He'd always send me a message

15:31.166 --> 15:33.208
whenever he couldn't stand it
at home anymore.

15:33.791 --> 15:35.916
But this time, nothing.

15:38.583 --> 15:41.416
Let's go. Otherwise Mom will be angry.

-It will happen again.
-How'd it go at the doctor's?

16:22.833 --> 16:24.125
It will happen again.

16:24.208 --> 16:25.916
Fine. Just a check-up.

16:29.750 --> 16:31.583
It will happen again.

16:32.791 --> 16:35.750
I have to go. I'm running late.
I just forgot something.

16:35.833 --> 16:37.625

<i>Erik Obendorf</i>
<i>has been missing since October 22.</i>

18:41.458 --> 18:44.291
That's almost two weeks now.
No traces, no witnesses.

18:44.375 --> 18:49.083
Questioning the neighbors didn't bring
any new evidence to light either.

18:51.958 --> 18:53.708
So, do you have any ideas?

18:57.916 --> 19:00.916
We still haven't got the shift schedules
from the nuclear power plant.

19:03.208 --> 19:06.500
All right, then follow up on that.
Go see Tiedemann.

19:06.583 --> 19:09.416
-WÃ¶ller, look into the tire treads.
-Yes.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.666
-Jankowski, talk to the Obendorfs again.
-Okay.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.500
Maybe he just took off.

19:15.625 --> 19:17.291
It wouldn't be the first time.

20:22.833 --> 20:24.958
<i>Well, a black hole...</i>

20:25.750 --> 20:29.750
<i>forms when a central region collapses in</i>
<i>upon itself.</i>

20:30.166 --> 20:31.833
And it contains neutrons.

20:31.916 --> 20:32.750
WORMHOLE

20:32.833 --> 20:35.125
Well, more like neutron matter.

20:35.208 --> 20:37.083
But not enough of it.

20:37.166 --> 20:40.958
So when the light of a star
three times the mass of the sun goes out,

20:42.208 --> 20:43.416
then it explodes.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.416
No, it implodes.

20:45.708 --> 20:47.625
And that is a black hole.

20:48.333 --> 20:49.333
And...

20:53.000 --> 20:54.291
Can I help you?

20:57.583 --> 20:58.416
Hello?

20:58.916 --> 20:59.875
Are you new?

21:03.166 --> 21:04.416
I'm Jonas.

21:05.375 --> 21:07.125
Are you sure this is your class?

21:11.416 --> 21:13.666
I wasn't notified of any new students.

21:15.750 --> 21:17.625
A signature was missing.

21:24.041 --> 21:25.250
Okay.

21:26.458 --> 21:28.208
Bartosz, please continue.

21:28.291 --> 21:29.291
Mm-hmm.

21:30.750 --> 21:33.166
So then we have a black hole.

21:33.916 --> 21:35.791
And it has a huge gravitational pull.

21:36.291 --> 21:40.875
Everything flying around the hole
is drawn to it and somehow dragged inside.

21:42.041 --> 21:45.291
Other stars, planets, and even light.

21:46.416 --> 21:50.375
The gravitational force is so strong,
that even light is pulled into it.

21:51.583 --> 21:54.416
Nothing can escape once it's inside.

21:55.791 --> 21:58.208
Basically, no one knows what's behind it.

21:58.291 --> 22:01.708
Maybe nothing. Or maybe a new world.

22:01.791 --> 22:04.833
A world in which nothing is
as it is in ours.

22:07.166 --> 22:11.708
All I'm asking is to review
your employees' shift schedules.

22:12.791 --> 22:15.375
Erik was last seen on the forest road.

22:15.958 --> 22:17.416
The schedules

22:17.500 --> 22:21.291
will allow us to check employee vehicles
with the tire treads we found.

22:23.208 --> 22:24.916
Do you have a court order?

22:25.875 --> 22:27.375
This is a request.

22:29.041 --> 22:30.083
Not an order.

22:34.958 --> 22:36.791
I'll have someone search them out.

22:46.375 --> 22:47.625
How are you?

22:53.791 --> 22:54.750
Holding up.

22:57.583 --> 22:58.541
Okay, then.

23:06.958 --> 23:08.250
I was wondering...

23:09.375 --> 23:12.166
Do you think Erik could have made his way
onto the grounds?

23:13.291 --> 23:16.208
The caves are partly located
under the nuclear power plant.

23:16.583 --> 23:17.916
That's impossible.

23:20.166 --> 23:22.750
The access points
were sealed up years ago.

23:23.791 --> 23:25.208
No one can get in that way.

23:28.666 --> 23:29.708
Okay, then.

23:41.916 --> 23:44.375
<i>A quick reminder</i>
<i>that all afternoon activities</i>

23:44.458 --> 23:47.708

24:21.166 --> 24:23.125
-I wanted to see you.
-Uh-huh.

24:27.375 --> 24:28.541
I don't know...

24:30.791 --> 24:32.291
I know you andÂ Ulrich...

24:33.166 --> 24:35.750
Ulrich and the kids...
I know they're part of him.

24:37.791 --> 24:40.208
And I want you to know
I won't stand in the way of that.

24:42.375 --> 24:44.500
That's very generous of you.

24:50.375 --> 24:52.500
Did Ulrich stop
at your place this morning?

24:55.250 --> 24:56.916
He wanted to bring something by.

24:58.250 --> 24:59.625
Bring what by?

25:00.041 --> 25:01.125
I don't know.

25:03.166 --> 25:05.583
Something for school. For the kids.

25:11.541 --> 25:12.416
No.

25:16.041 --> 25:17.666
Then maybe he forgot.

25:41.416 --> 25:44.958
Please don't forget to turn in
your presentations next week.

25:45.333 --> 25:46.666
No exceptions!

25:55.958 --> 25:56.916
Something up?

25:58.375 --> 26:00.416
You didn't tell me why I'm here.

26:02.250 --> 26:03.416
Do we know each other?

26:07.333 --> 26:09.041
You have no idea who I am.

26:13.916 --> 26:14.791
You coming?

26:42.500 --> 26:43.625
Everything okay?

26:45.333 --> 26:46.625
What day is it today?

26:49.041 --> 26:50.083
November 4.

26:52.250 --> 26:53.083
What year?

26:54.208 --> 26:55.416
2019.

26:55.500 --> 26:56.750
I don't understand...

27:15.833 --> 27:16.708
Mom?

27:17.916 --> 27:18.750
Pardon?

27:22.166 --> 27:23.458
Are you okay?

27:27.125 --> 27:28.500
Can I help you?

27:49.958 --> 27:51.750
POLICE

28:01.833 --> 28:02.791
Charlotte?

28:23.916 --> 28:25.458
We have to stop this.

28:27.083 --> 28:29.541
That's not what
you were saying this morning.

28:37.083 --> 28:38.333
Ulrich, not here.

28:41.125 --> 28:43.375
Oh... I'm sorry.

28:43.458 --> 28:44.291
What is it?

28:46.541 --> 28:48.583
Um... the...

28:48.666 --> 28:50.083
The tire treads.

28:50.166 --> 28:52.125
Forty-seven cars and two trucks.

28:52.625 --> 28:55.458
In Winden alone
there are 21,000 registered vehicles.

28:55.541 --> 28:57.916
Yes. What do you want me to do with that?

28:58.291 --> 28:59.166
I...

29:00.583 --> 29:01.416
No idea.

29:01.500 --> 29:04.375
I got the power plant shift schedules.
We can run a check.

29:07.125 --> 29:08.041
WÃ¶ller.

29:20.125 --> 29:22.791
<i>From then on, I knew that nothing changes.</i>

29:22.875 --> 29:24.500
<i>That all things remain.</i>

29:25.000 --> 29:26.750
The spinning wheel turns.

29:27.333 --> 29:29.208
Round and round, in a circle.

29:30.291 --> 29:32.541
One fate tied to the next.

29:33.041 --> 29:34.541
A thread,

29:35.041 --> 29:36.666
red like blood,

29:36.750 --> 29:39.083
that connects all our deeds.

29:39.958 --> 29:42.000
One cannot unravel the knots.

29:42.708 --> 29:44.208
But they can be severed.

29:45.708 --> 29:47.375
He severed ours

29:47.458 --> 29:49.291
with the sharpest blade.

29:50.958 --> 29:54.125
And yet, something remains behind
that cannot be severed.

29:54.708 --> 29:56.375
An invisible bond.

29:58.750 --> 30:00.750
On many a night, he tugs at it.

30:00.833 --> 30:05.208
And then I wake with a start,
knowing that nothing ceases to be.

30:05.833 --> 30:06.833
That all remains.

30:13.458 --> 30:16.166
And because
their eyes and hearts were blind,

30:16.958 --> 30:20.375
they were punished for their sins.
Here and now.

30:20.458 --> 30:22.416
And what flew plummeted to Earth.

30:22.500 --> 30:24.875
And what was on Earth changed its shape.

30:24.958 --> 30:27.041
Revealed its grotesque face,

30:27.125 --> 30:30.041
which was nothing
but blasphemy made flesh.

30:36.541 --> 30:38.416
Great. We'll stop here.

30:38.916 --> 30:41.083
Unfortunately,
we have to finish early today.

30:41.583 --> 30:45.541
Please put everything away
for the parents' meeting tonight. Thanks.

30:48.708 --> 30:51.083
Nine o'clock tonight by the bridge.
Don't forget.

31:02.541 --> 31:03.583
Martha.

31:06.541 --> 31:09.916
I have no idea what you want from me,
but I want nothing from you, okay?

31:10.750 --> 31:11.791
So get lost.

31:15.208 --> 31:17.916
Please listen to me.
Maybe you don't know who I am.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.750
-But today is November 4, and Mikkel--
-What? Mikkel?

31:23.625 --> 31:26.208
Michael Kahnwald, Hannah's husband.
He's not who you think--

31:26.291 --> 31:27.958
Hannah's husband? Are you joking?

31:30.875 --> 31:32.958
I don't know any Michael Kahnwald.

31:33.750 --> 31:36.125
Hannah's husband is my dad
and his name is Ulrich.

31:38.041 --> 31:40.666
I don't know what your deal is,
but just fuck off already, okay?

32:54.791 --> 32:56.958
Wait. Not so fast.

33:50.708 --> 33:51.541
I...

33:52.250 --> 33:53.458
love you.

33:57.750 --> 34:00.833
I love you.

34:17.166 --> 34:18.916
It will happen again.

34:20.458 --> 34:21.958
It will...

34:22.791 --> 34:24.375
happen again.

34:25.416 --> 34:27.375
It will happen again.

34:30.250 --> 34:31.166
Mom?

34:31.791 --> 34:32.750
Dad?

34:32.833 --> 34:34.666
It will happen again.

34:35.458 --> 34:36.541
It will...

34:37.708 --> 34:39.333
happen again.

34:42.250 --> 34:43.666
Tick, tock.

34:45.208 --> 34:46.291
Tick, tock.

34:46.375 --> 34:48.666
-Grandpa, is everything okay?
-Tick, tock.

34:49.083 --> 34:50.291
Tick, tock.

34:52.708 --> 34:54.500
The beginning is the end.

34:55.083 --> 34:57.750
And the end is the beginning.

35:05.291 --> 35:06.541
Tick, tock.

35:09.250 --> 35:10.583
Tick, tock.

35:28.708 --> 35:32.333
REGINA TIEDEMANN
AUGUST 1, 1971 - SEPTEMBER 2, 2019

35:37.125 --> 35:38.166
Can I help you?

35:51.083 --> 35:52.958
Are you looking for
something in particular?

35:54.958 --> 35:57.416
I wanted to know
if someone was buried here.

35:58.208 --> 35:59.041
Who?

36:02.541 --> 36:03.625
Kahnwald,

36:04.833 --> 36:06.083
Michael Kahnwald.

36:08.625 --> 36:11.125
No, we have a Daniel Kahnwald,
died in '64,

36:12.041 --> 36:13.458
but no Michael Kahnwald.

36:17.458 --> 36:19.166
Maybe that's why I'm here.

36:22.458 --> 36:24.000
So that it doesn't happen.

36:25.625 --> 36:26.750
What happens?

36:28.541 --> 36:29.625
Do I know you?

36:32.208 --> 36:34.625
I feel like
I've seen you somewhere before.

36:45.666 --> 36:46.625
Hey, wait!

36:48.041 --> 36:49.291
What's your name?

37:14.666 --> 37:20.291
SEPTEMBER 21, 1987

37:35.583 --> 37:36.416
Hello?

37:45.708 --> 37:49.166
Can I help you? You must be lost.

38:01.708 --> 38:03.208
The master key.

38:04.833 --> 38:06.916
For the nuclear power plant.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.500
Is this a joke?

38:09.333 --> 38:10.666
You kept it.

38:13.208 --> 38:14.833
Do you think this is funny?

38:32.833 --> 38:35.416
If you don't leave, I'll call the police.

38:59.166 --> 39:00.000
<i>Police--</i>

39:15.041 --> 39:16.750
What do you want from me?

39:28.583 --> 39:30.041
Nothing is in vain.

39:31.833 --> 39:33.333
No breath.

39:34.500 --> 39:35.750
No step.

39:36.875 --> 39:38.083
No word.

39:39.750 --> 39:41.250
No pain.

39:44.250 --> 39:46.791
An everlasting miracle...

39:47.625 --> 39:48.791
of the One.

39:49.208 --> 39:51.166
Who the hell are you?

40:41.208 --> 40:43.041
The police were here today.

40:43.833 --> 40:45.708
You know what you've got to do.

42:01.916 --> 42:02.958
Kilian?

42:06.333 --> 42:07.958
Stop screwing around, okay?

42:21.375 --> 42:22.250
What is this?

42:25.666 --> 42:27.000
What do you want here?

42:27.625 --> 42:29.333
I don't want to scare you.

42:30.583 --> 42:33.541
-Why did you say we know each other?
-We do know each other.

42:34.250 --> 42:36.000
Not now, but in another time.

42:39.291 --> 42:40.625
What does that mean?

42:56.916 --> 42:58.625
You've seen all this before.

42:59.583 --> 43:00.666
The light.

43:01.750 --> 43:03.000
The forest. Me.

43:08.416 --> 43:09.750
It's dÃ©jÃ  vu.

43:10.875 --> 43:13.041
Or a glitch in the matrix.

43:14.458 --> 43:15.291
What?

43:19.375 --> 43:21.458
I think I know why I'm here now.

43:22.958 --> 43:24.500
Why you came to get me.

43:25.875 --> 43:27.291
So that I change it.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.166
Change what?

43:38.208 --> 43:39.166
Who is he?

43:40.500 --> 43:42.833
-Where's Mikkel?
-Mikkel?

43:43.375 --> 43:44.958
Mikkel isn't with you?

43:45.333 --> 43:46.500
Are you blind or what?

43:49.875 --> 43:51.125
What's he doing here?

43:52.583 --> 43:53.791
Did you bring him along?

43:55.291 --> 43:56.291
What is this?

43:58.583 --> 44:00.791
-How do you know my brother?
-This can't be.

44:00.875 --> 44:04.125
You took him with you.
Heide, the babysitter, is sick.

44:04.208 --> 44:07.083
And he didn't want to stay home alone,
so he came along.

44:09.750 --> 44:11.541
No idea what the fuck this is,

44:11.958 --> 44:14.291
but Mikkel is old enough
to look after himself.

44:15.041 --> 44:16.666
Now, you'd better fuck off.

44:17.875 --> 44:19.000
Get lost, freak.

44:25.458 --> 44:26.291
Come on.

44:29.833 --> 44:30.666
Martha.

44:46.500 --> 44:49.916
POLICE

44:52.666 --> 44:55.750
Charlotte?
I'm going to the parents' meeting.

44:56.333 --> 44:58.000
I can give you a ride if you like.

45:00.708 --> 45:01.541
All right.

45:03.250 --> 45:04.833
-Will you carry on with this?
-Mm-hmm.

45:55.083 --> 45:56.875
Why did he act like he knew you?

45:59.375 --> 46:01.625
-Do you know him?
-No.

46:02.166 --> 46:03.125
Who knows.

46:06.750 --> 46:10.041
Did you know Nostradamus predicted
the world would end this year?

46:10.750 --> 46:12.083
What a load of crap.

46:13.500 --> 46:14.916
No. Really.

46:15.375 --> 46:17.583
The apocalypse
is practically around the corner.

46:18.500 --> 46:20.791
Glad I got myself a girlfriend
with her own bunker.

46:21.583 --> 46:23.125
What?

46:23.875 --> 46:24.708
Nothing.

46:25.083 --> 46:25.916
Ow!

46:26.000 --> 46:27.041
What?

47:05.458 --> 47:08.416
And you think you'll find something here?

47:09.125 --> 47:11.041
Erik sometimes spent nights here
in summer.

47:14.625 --> 47:16.416
Maybe the police overlooked something.

47:19.500 --> 47:21.541
Have you heard the story
of the cave monster?

47:21.875 --> 47:24.708
-Spare us the bullshit, man.
-It's not bullshit.

47:25.791 --> 47:27.208
Some 100 years ago,

47:27.291 --> 47:30.500
just after World War I,
they did experiments in there.

47:30.583 --> 47:32.083
What kind of experiments?

47:34.000 --> 47:35.333
-What was that?
-What?

47:43.500 --> 47:44.458
Shit.

47:44.833 --> 47:46.291
What's in the cave?

47:46.375 --> 47:47.583
-What is it?
-Oh, shit!

47:48.208 --> 47:49.416
-Fuck!
-What is that?

47:49.875 --> 47:51.500
-Fuck! What's going on?
-Go! Run!

47:51.583 --> 47:53.208
-What's with the flashlights?
-Go!

47:53.500 --> 47:55.625
-Out of here! Out of here!
-Martha!

47:55.708 --> 47:57.166
-Martha, come on.
-Out of here!

47:57.250 --> 47:58.375
Run! Run!

48:15.041 --> 48:16.000
Kilian?

48:21.458 --> 48:22.541
Kilian?

48:28.375 --> 48:29.416
Martha.

51:28.166 --> 51:30.583
-Is it over?
-I think so.

51:34.791 --> 51:35.916
What...

51:36.625 --> 51:38.166
What... What is that?

51:39.750 --> 51:40.791
Oh, God!

51:44.333 --> 51:45.458
Fuck!

51:46.250 --> 51:47.125
Shit!

51:48.166 --> 51:50.250
Oh, shit. Shit!

51:50.333 --> 51:51.583
Fuck.

51:56.791 --> 51:58.541
-Is he dead?
-Fuck.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.625
Yes, I think so.

52:00.958 --> 52:03.375
Who... Who is that?

52:09.250 --> 52:11.166
STUDENT CARD
MADS NIELSEN, DECEMBER 4, 1973

52:14.208 --> 52:15.375
Mads Nielsen.

52:53.916 --> 52:56.291
I've waited for this moment for so long.

52:58.041 --> 52:59.583
For you to come back.

53:04.083 --> 53:05.208
Who are you?

53:16.791 --> 53:17.625
Mikkel.

53:18.750 --> 53:20.708
He didn't travel back.

53:21.750 --> 53:23.666
He won't become your father.

53:23.750 --> 53:24.583
And you...

53:25.375 --> 53:27.666
will never be born in this world.

53:28.666 --> 53:31.416
A world without you.

53:32.875 --> 53:34.916
Isn't that what you wanted?

53:38.416 --> 53:39.583
Yet, despite that,

53:40.375 --> 53:44.416
this world is doomed
to the same fate as yours.

53:46.166 --> 53:48.125
Everything will fall apart.

53:49.125 --> 53:51.583
In this world, just as it will in yours.

53:53.375 --> 53:54.250
Again.

53:54.750 --> 53:55.666
And again.

53:57.708 --> 53:58.791
Because of you.

54:06.875 --> 54:08.208
And because of me.

54:15.000 --> 54:15.875
Martha.

54:45.583 --> 54:50.000
SEPTEMBER 21, 1888

55:27.083 --> 55:27.958
Jonas?

56:16.458 --> 56:17.875
You're alive.

56:22.375 --> 56:23.625
You're alive!

56:35.625 --> 56:36.916
I'm not Martha.

56:44.416 --> 56:45.750
Not your Martha.

56:51.750 --> 56:53.250
What does that mean?

57:01.041 --> 57:03.458
I'm here to help you find the origin.

57:05.750 --> 57:07.125
The one thing...

57:08.583 --> 57:10.666
that's the beginning of everything.

57:12.208 --> 57:13.458
In your world...

57:18.250 --> 57:19.375
and in mine.
