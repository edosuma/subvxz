WEBVTT

00:57.182 --> 00:58.392
Thank you.

01:20.247 --> 01:21.331
She's here.

01:27.629 --> 01:29.047
Good morning, everyone.

01:29.131 --> 01:30.382
Good morning, Leanne.

01:32.676 --> 01:34.094
Thank you.

01:35.304 --> 01:36.430
Do I get a balloon?

01:54.239 --> 01:57.451
Hi, Dorothy. Good morning.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.119
Here.

02:06.502 --> 02:08.503
Three weeks on that fucking couch.

02:08.586 --> 02:11.298
I don't know how I'm going to be
on my feet all day today.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.175
I'll have dinner waiting for you.

02:13.258 --> 02:16.261
That's very sweet, but we're shooting
back-to-back challenges,

02:16.345 --> 02:20.098
and then I have an interview with--
Fuck, I can't remember.

02:20.182 --> 02:21.892
Guess that's why I need an assistant.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.395
We're so lucky.
We have two stars in the house.

02:27.105 --> 02:30.108
Oh, shit, that's my car.
You wanna come join me on set for lunch?

02:32.402 --> 02:34.154
It's too chaotic for Jericho.

02:34.696 --> 02:35.906
Well, Leanne could--

02:41.078 --> 02:42.079
Yeah.

02:53.257 --> 02:56.343
I told you I don't want you in my room.
I will do my own laundry.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.179
Hello?

03:01.807 --> 03:04.059
No, I can't take that story.

03:04.142 --> 03:05.853
I still don't have childcare.

03:06.979 --> 03:10.399
Yes, I'm disappointed as well,
but there's nothing I can do.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.401
Thanks.

03:12.943 --> 03:15.070
Dorothy,
I really wish you'd just let me help you.

03:15.571 --> 03:16.572
It's my job.

03:16.655 --> 03:20.826
Since you seem so completely clueless,
let me make this as clear as a bell.

03:20.909 --> 03:23.537
You will never touch Jericho again.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.215
We'll walk the block. Check things out.

03:43.140 --> 03:44.141
Leanne?

03:45.601 --> 03:48.061
Hey, I don't know if you remember me.
Isabelle.

03:48.145 --> 03:50.564
We met at the street fair.
I work with Dorothy.

03:50.647 --> 03:51.648
Yeah.

03:52.858 --> 03:53.859
You okay?

03:54.484 --> 03:55.485
Yes.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.906
If you're sure. Take care of yourself.

04:08.790 --> 04:12.002
Hey, it's none of my business,
like, for sure…

04:13.754 --> 04:14.755
but…

04:15.672 --> 04:17.673
look, Dorothy means well.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.137
It's just-- Well, she can be tough.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.349
How do you know it's about Dorothy?

04:25.891 --> 04:28.310
'Cause, I recognize those tears.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.145
I've shed them.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.815
Did you know I started out as her intern?

04:34.650 --> 04:36.193
Yeah, right out of grad school.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.112
Dorothy taught me so much.

04:39.196 --> 04:43.700
She was open and generous, and she even
shared some of her clothes with me.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.495
And trust me, back then
I really needed the fashion help.

04:48.914 --> 04:52.835
But then sometimes she could be,
as my mom would say, "A real b-hole."

04:54.461 --> 04:56.255
Then I'd hide in the bathroom and bawl

04:56.338 --> 04:58.465
till my cheap mascara
made me look goth as hell.

05:00.759 --> 05:03.929
Let me guess, did she criticize
the way you held the baby?

05:05.138 --> 05:07.766
Or maybe did she say that your $30 haircut

05:07.850 --> 05:09.768
made you look like
an out-of-work stripper?

05:11.603 --> 05:12.813
She wasn't wrong.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.525
I really wished she'd let me help her.

05:19.194 --> 05:20.779
But she just gets so mad.

05:20.863 --> 05:22.364
Yeah, she's a perfectionist.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.659
It can be tough
to live up to those standards.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.331
But I bet even she messes up sometimes.

05:37.754 --> 05:38.881
Crap, that's work.

05:39.506 --> 05:40.883
Supposed to be off today.

05:40.966 --> 05:45.596
Look, I don't know if you'd be into this,
but I have some time on Wednesday.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.097
Maybe we could get a coffee?

05:47.806 --> 05:49.141
I could use a friend.

05:50.767 --> 05:53.645
Yeah. I'd like that.

05:54.438 --> 05:56.356
Awesome, catch you then.

05:56.440 --> 05:57.649
Okay.

06:03.488 --> 06:04.740
I think you hit it too hard.

06:06.408 --> 06:07.659
Picture will cover it.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.457
It's crooked.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.293
What? You asked for my help.

06:17.085 --> 06:18.170
I was worried about you.

06:18.253 --> 06:20.923
I haven't seen you lurking around
raiding our fridge.

06:21.006 --> 06:23.425
I've years of experience
of avoiding Dorothy's wrath.

06:24.301 --> 06:26.428
-Think she'll like it?
-She always did.

06:26.512 --> 06:28.931
It's supposed to be
about oppressed vaginas.

06:30.599 --> 06:32.059
I just see a black hole.

06:33.519 --> 06:36.063
Or are you asking me
if it'll make Dorothy like you again?

06:36.146 --> 06:37.981
I'm doing everything I can think of.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.860
I'm gonna fix some shit in Leanne's room.
Will you grab the tool bag?

06:41.944 --> 06:43.779
You go ahead. I'll catch up.

06:55.249 --> 06:56.917
They been at that all day?

06:57.876 --> 06:59.169
Since 6:00 a.m.

07:00.003 --> 07:01.421
Drove Dorothy to leave.

07:03.674 --> 07:05.092
Did you want something, Julian?

07:24.069 --> 07:25.070
Get me a glass.

07:34.913 --> 07:36.123
Pour me some milk.

07:46.592 --> 07:47.801
To the top.

08:16.955 --> 08:18.207
I'm gonna go now.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.376
If that's what you really want.

08:47.110 --> 08:51.532
I know it's one of your favorites, so
I thought it should be displayed proudly.

08:54.243 --> 08:55.452
There's more.

08:56.787 --> 09:00.207
I fixed Leanne's window, and then I fixed
the loose handle on the bathroom.

09:00.290 --> 09:03.752
And the guy said the basement will be done
in an hour. We just have to let it dry.

09:04.336 --> 09:06.880
And I fixed the slat we broke.

09:07.548 --> 09:10.801
This is a pathetically clumsy attempt
to get back in our marriage bed.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.512
Dorothy, my back is killing me
from that shitty couch upstairs.

09:13.595 --> 09:15.681
-Isn't that punishment enough?
-You know what you need to do

09:15.764 --> 09:17.516
if you wanna fix this. It's simple.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.061
Dorothy, please.

09:22.396 --> 09:24.231
Haven't we been through this already?

09:25.023 --> 09:28.652
Yes, and I still don't understand
why you insist on keeping her here

09:28.735 --> 09:30.571
when I clearly want her gone.

09:30.654 --> 09:32.656
Because she brought
our family back together,

09:32.739 --> 09:33.949
can't you see that?

09:34.575 --> 09:37.536
Yes, we needed the help,
but we were just fine

09:37.619 --> 09:39.246
before Leanne even showed up.

09:39.329 --> 09:40.998
No, we weren't.

09:45.544 --> 09:47.254
You're not telling me everything.

09:48.797 --> 09:50.424
What does she have over you?

09:51.300 --> 09:52.509
Or on you?

09:54.595 --> 09:58.432
She doesn't have anybody, Dorothy.
We're her family.

10:00.267 --> 10:03.270
And we owe her for what she went through.

10:04.438 --> 10:06.064
You mean what I put her through?

10:06.732 --> 10:09.943
-She had my baby, Sean. I had no choice.
-Our baby.

10:13.405 --> 10:15.032
Maybe you should get a new couch.

10:16.575 --> 10:19.411
Hi. Hi, okay, come.

10:20.245 --> 10:21.747
Come here, buddy.

10:34.927 --> 10:36.470
-Hey.
-Hey.

10:37.012 --> 10:39.264
If you wanted to come by set tomorrow,
you're welcome.

10:39.932 --> 10:43.268
I imagine it's been a lot
to be holed up here with an angry Dorothy.

10:47.814 --> 10:50.067
Do you wanna stay? Listen to the music.

11:04.915 --> 11:07.751
You know, before I met Dorothy,
I was never really lonely.

11:08.293 --> 11:09.294
I mean--

11:12.798 --> 11:16.802
I would spend a lot of time alone.
I just-- It didn't really bother me.

11:17.636 --> 11:22.057
And then she stepped into my life
and I never wanted to be without her.

11:24.393 --> 11:25.811
Now I am, more than ever.

11:28.063 --> 11:30.440
I just wanna sit down and have a meal,
you know?

11:30.524 --> 11:37.072
Something stupid and delicious.
And then hold her and hold our son.

11:38.824 --> 11:40.284
Is that too much to ask?

11:43.579 --> 11:44.580
No.

11:46.707 --> 11:49.626
No, I'm still unavailable.

11:51.253 --> 11:53.797
Yes, believe me,
I'm as frustrated as you are.

11:54.923 --> 11:58.093
Yeah-- You know,
could you do me a little favor though?

11:59.136 --> 12:01.138
Could you give this story to Jeremy?

12:01.722 --> 12:03.432
Ye-- Oh, you're a dear.

12:03.515 --> 12:05.350
Okay, I'm gonna be by a little later.

12:05.434 --> 12:07.603
I'm gonna bring Jericho
so you can give him a squeeze.

12:07.686 --> 12:08.979
Okay, thanks.

12:09.771 --> 12:12.316
-You're still here?
-Yeah, they pushed a couple of hours,

12:12.399 --> 12:14.735
so I thought I'd make the stock
for a special meal.

12:16.570 --> 12:17.905
Why?

12:17.988 --> 12:20.115
Well, since you missed the premiere
I thought, you know,

12:20.199 --> 12:22.034
we could have our own little celebration.

12:22.117 --> 12:23.911
Watch the next episode tomorrow,

12:23.994 --> 12:28.665
and I'm making a traditional zampone on a
bed of brown lentils with a whole little--

12:28.749 --> 12:31.543
I'll call my dad,
tell him to bring Kourtney with a K.

12:31.627 --> 12:34.254
Well, no, I thought like a--
maybe a small celebration.

12:34.338 --> 12:35.547
Cocktails at 7:00.

12:39.051 --> 12:41.470
Hi, Dad. Yeah, how are you?

13:29.017 --> 13:30.102
Hi.

13:30.185 --> 13:31.687
Never a dull day in the city.

13:32.229 --> 13:33.480
Is everyone okay?

13:33.564 --> 13:37.359
Yeah, I think so. An unhoused guy
was passed out on the sidewalk.

13:37.442 --> 13:39.570
He wouldn't wake up,
so I called an ambulance.

13:39.653 --> 13:41.947
They said he was dehydrated,
but he should be fine.

13:42.489 --> 13:46.118
I might have overreacted,
but I couldn't just step over him.

13:46.201 --> 13:49.037
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah. You did the right thing.

13:50.914 --> 13:54.501
Best doughnuts in the state.
They go great with coffee.

13:54.585 --> 13:55.794
I'll make some.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.255
Dorothy's not here?

13:58.338 --> 14:01.466
No, she's been spending a lot of time
out of the house recently.

14:16.481 --> 14:19.693
-Cream or sugar?
-Just bitter and black, thank you.

14:20.986 --> 14:23.197
Get a doughnut in there.
They're so darn good.

14:24.781 --> 14:27.618
Wow. Does Dorothy keep all of her stories?

14:28.702 --> 14:30.120
Do you not keep yours?

14:30.204 --> 14:32.623
Yeah, right, 'cause my biographers
need to see tape of me

14:32.706 --> 14:35.417
delivering the news in a bathing suit. No.

14:37.252 --> 14:39.171
Might have kept this one though.

14:40.339 --> 14:41.340
C'est la vie.

14:42.341 --> 14:43.342
What's that one?

14:44.927 --> 14:46.720
Oh, it's nothing really.

14:47.721 --> 14:52.100
I got wind of an FBI raid
on this rich hedge fund jerk

14:52.184 --> 14:54.520
for all kinds of illegal crap
before it went down.

14:54.603 --> 14:58.273
I even interviewed the target
on a false story a few days before.

14:58.357 --> 15:00.192
That sounds really scary.

15:01.318 --> 15:03.612
I was terrified, but it was worth it.

15:04.196 --> 15:05.906
But why is it in Dorothy's collection?

15:05.989 --> 15:07.950
I put the whole thing together
and showed her.

15:08.033 --> 15:11.662
She was really impressed, but she said
I didn't have the clout to sell it.

15:11.745 --> 15:13.956
That the higher-ups
wouldn't take me seriously.

15:14.039 --> 15:16.041
So she did it for me.

15:16.124 --> 15:17.751
And then she got all the credit?

15:17.835 --> 15:21.213
Well, yeah, but the story got on the air.
That's what matters, right?

15:23.841 --> 15:26.260
And we haven't seen much
of Dorothy lately.

15:27.094 --> 15:29.930
We're all kinda worried about her.

15:30.931 --> 15:32.015
Is she okay?

15:32.099 --> 15:35.394
She's fine. She's just busy with Jericho.

15:35.477 --> 15:37.187
Oh, is there anything wrong with him?

15:37.271 --> 15:39.648
No, he's perfect.

15:40.524 --> 15:41.525
Oh, good.

15:42.526 --> 15:45.904
I was worried he was sick
or something scary happened.

15:45.988 --> 15:48.156
Like with that whole ambulance thing
last year.

15:49.992 --> 15:51.535
-God.
-Here.

15:52.202 --> 15:53.203
I'm sorry.

15:54.997 --> 15:56.206
Thank you.

15:56.915 --> 15:59.960
Oh, Leanne. Did you hurt yourself?

16:00.043 --> 16:01.253
No, no.

16:04.882 --> 16:06.091
Did someone else hurt you?

16:08.135 --> 16:13.557
No, nobody-- It wasn't Doroth--
She didn't do this.

16:17.269 --> 16:19.104
Okay, I won't push.

16:20.689 --> 16:25.110
But if you ever wanna talk about anything,
I'm here. Cool?

16:29.489 --> 16:30.699
Yeah, okay.

17:30.175 --> 17:31.218
Open your eyes.

17:37.975 --> 17:39.643
Tell me what happened today.

17:39.726 --> 17:42.646
We were walking the block
when we saw the ambulance.

17:42.729 --> 17:46.191
But I don't know why they came.
The man seemed fine.

17:46.275 --> 17:48.110
I noticed him in the park earlier.

17:49.278 --> 17:50.445
Was he passed out?

17:50.529 --> 17:53.824
Not when we got there.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.

17:54.992 --> 17:58.078
Did you hear what the pretty blonde lady
was saying to the EMT?

17:58.161 --> 18:00.747
-The one who came to visit me after.
-No.

18:00.831 --> 18:04.209
But it seemed serious.
The EMT looked angry.

18:05.961 --> 18:07.588
We have something for you.

18:17.181 --> 18:18.182
Stand.

18:22.853 --> 18:25.063
This is what they used to control us.

18:26.106 --> 18:28.108
This was a symbol of our fear.

18:31.403 --> 18:33.030
But I'm not afraid anymore.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.038
Are you?

18:57.971 --> 19:01.850
I'm not quite sure
this is what Chef Stephen was going for.

19:01.934 --> 19:05.145
Yeah. Chef Stephen,
I have some choice words about--

19:38.804 --> 19:41.014
I didn't know that you'd still be awake.

19:41.557 --> 19:43.141
Don't concern yourself with me.

19:44.685 --> 19:46.562
I was just visiting my friends.

19:50.399 --> 19:51.942
They could be your friends too.

19:55.737 --> 19:56.738
Okay.

20:00.117 --> 20:01.326
Good night, Dorothy.

20:39.740 --> 20:42.326
Isabelle? What can I do for you?

20:42.993 --> 20:44.203
I know what you did.

20:45.704 --> 20:49.208
Oh. Isabelle, Jeremy is just right
for the story, okay?

20:49.291 --> 20:52.252
No. This isn't about
you undermining my career.

20:52.336 --> 20:54.171
This is about me ending yours.

20:55.589 --> 20:58.175
I don't know how you're not in jail,
but you're not gonna get away with this.

21:00.677 --> 21:02.679
Oh. I see.

21:04.097 --> 21:06.600
Have you been talking to her?
What did she tell you?

21:06.683 --> 21:08.644
Because, trust me,
it's not the full story.

21:10.646 --> 21:11.855
Leanne?

21:15.567 --> 21:16.985
Excuse me.

21:33.335 --> 21:35.587
Did you call the EMTs
to find out about Dorothy?

21:36.755 --> 21:37.756
Yes.

21:38.340 --> 21:39.800
I'm sorry I lied to you, Leanne,

21:39.883 --> 21:41.760
-but it was part of my investigation.
-Leanne!

21:41.844 --> 21:44.304
The woman at the street fair
got into my head.

21:44.388 --> 21:46.974
And I did some digging on my own,
but I couldn't find much.

21:47.057 --> 21:49.017
But that EMT gave me a small lead.

21:49.101 --> 21:51.395
One of them had been here on a call
in August

21:51.478 --> 21:54.857
and he wouldn't spill the details,
but he seemed horrified by what he saw.

21:54.940 --> 21:57.776
So I went searching for death records.

22:01.238 --> 22:02.447
That's not Jericho.

22:03.699 --> 22:06.910
Is that your baby, Leanne?
Has Dorothy taken him from you?

22:08.829 --> 22:10.664
So you didn't really wanna be friends?

22:11.206 --> 22:16.170
I-- No, I-- I like you, Leanne.
And I'm genuinely worried about you.

22:16.253 --> 22:19.464
She-- She's hurt you.
And she killed her baby.

22:21.758 --> 22:23.135
What are you gonna do?

22:23.218 --> 22:25.721
Expose her. I mean, she should go to jail.

22:25.804 --> 22:27.890
But I guess
her rich daddy paid someone off.

22:27.973 --> 22:29.808
But at least I can ruin her career.

22:31.894 --> 22:35.564
Look, I honestly don't wanna do
anything to hurt you, Leanne.

22:36.064 --> 22:37.482
You've been hurt enough.

22:38.984 --> 22:40.402
But I have to tell the truth.

22:44.489 --> 22:46.867
Oh, I have to be air ready in an hour.

22:46.950 --> 22:50.245
Okay. Don't worry, Leanne,
I won't leave you out in the cold.

22:50.329 --> 22:53.957
I'll help you find a new family.
Maybe one who appreciates a great nanny.

22:57.044 --> 22:59.087
Were you just talking to Isabelle?

22:59.171 --> 23:02.174
Yes. She wants to be my friend.

23:02.257 --> 23:05.594
Friends? Is that why she showed up
on my doorstep accusing me of--

23:06.803 --> 23:08.722
Did you happen to
mention your culpability in all of this?

23:08.805 --> 23:10.933
Did you tell her why I was forced to--

23:11.016 --> 23:12.851
What is this, your petty revenge?

23:14.228 --> 23:15.437
Dorothy.

23:16.730 --> 23:19.024
I don't hold a grudge against you.

23:20.067 --> 23:23.070
You did what you had to do
to get Jericho back.

23:24.655 --> 23:26.740
Any good mother
would have done the same thing.

23:38.418 --> 23:39.545
What was that all about?

23:40.212 --> 23:41.338
I'll be in my room.

23:42.214 --> 23:43.757
I don't think that's a good idea.

23:45.467 --> 23:47.302
Don't be afraid of feeling good, Julian.

24:08.532 --> 24:10.659
Leanne! Where have you been?

24:10.742 --> 24:13.412
I need help with the appetizers
and I gotta prep the cocktails.

24:14.162 --> 24:15.163
Will you get that?

24:15.247 --> 24:18.208
No way, it's my father.
I haven't done my deep breathing yet.

24:18.292 --> 24:20.460
Leanne, could you put the polenta
in the frico cups?

24:20.544 --> 24:23.338
And can you continue
to be completely fucking useless?

24:25.007 --> 24:26.008
Hey.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.260
-What?
-Are you gonna change?

24:29.136 --> 24:31.263
What? Now I have to play dress-up
for my husband?

24:31.346 --> 24:33.765
I'm sorry I'm an embarrassment to you.

24:34.808 --> 24:38.061
-Hi. How are you?
-Hi. Hey. Hi.

24:41.148 --> 24:42.566
I'm sorry about my appearance.

24:42.649 --> 24:45.068
I just had so much on my plate
with Jericho.

24:45.152 --> 24:46.904
I've sort of
let everything else fall away.

24:46.987 --> 24:48.655
Leanne, help me prep the cocktails.

24:48.739 --> 24:49.948
Still here.

24:51.950 --> 24:53.619
There's some appetizers in the kitchen.

24:55.871 --> 24:59.124
I'll just go see what that
famous husband of yours has made.

25:00.042 --> 25:01.043
Dad.

25:03.170 --> 25:05.130
-Chef Sean!
-Kourtney.

25:05.214 --> 25:09.051
I tried to get her out of here.
And I failed, clearly.

25:09.134 --> 25:12.054
Because you've always been
too soft, Dorothy,

25:12.137 --> 25:15.098
not willing to go all the way.
It's held you back.

25:15.182 --> 25:17.768
But I've been researching a new plan.

25:18.435 --> 25:22.189
Mostly out of the house because
I cannot trust anyone under this roof.

25:22.773 --> 25:28.570
But I've come to the conclusion
that Leanne should be sent away.

25:28.654 --> 25:29.863
For her own health.

25:29.947 --> 25:31.949
Institutionalized?

25:34.326 --> 25:35.953
That's a serious step, Dottie.

25:36.036 --> 25:39.081
This girl needs help.
And I don't know what else to do.

25:39.164 --> 25:43.168
I can't work. I can't sleep.
I can't even think with her around.

25:43.252 --> 25:45.337
Can you help me?

25:45.420 --> 25:47.256
Mushroom scallop with oyster foam?

25:52.261 --> 25:53.345
I'm gonna go change.

25:53.428 --> 25:54.304
Thank God.

25:54.388 --> 25:56.598
So excited. You know?

25:56.682 --> 25:58.892
Don't mind if I do.

26:13.198 --> 26:14.199
Yes.

26:14.867 --> 26:16.451
Thank you.

26:16.535 --> 26:18.078
-Oh, my goodness.
-Thanks.

26:18.912 --> 26:20.330
-Sean?
-Thank you.

26:21.039 --> 26:23.667
-Dorothy?
-I'm fine.

26:27.796 --> 26:29.840
I thought I told you…

26:29.923 --> 26:31.216
-I know.
-Yeah.

26:31.300 --> 26:33.177
Life hasn't always been smooth for me.

26:34.344 --> 26:36.013
Oh, no. It's just a promo.

26:36.096 --> 26:38.098
-You say that now.
-Homeless by 17.

26:39.683 --> 26:40.893
Then cooking saved me.

26:41.560 --> 26:43.395
-Okay, apron.
-Taught me how to treat myself…

26:43.478 --> 26:45.189
-Did you get to bring that home?
-…how to treat others.

26:45.272 --> 26:46.940
'Cause I might need to borrow it.

26:47.024 --> 26:50.277
I've learned it doesn't matter
where you've been.

26:50.360 --> 26:52.154
What matters is who you're feeding today.

26:52.237 --> 26:54.281
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, yes. Okay.

26:55.532 --> 26:57.576
So if you can't stand the heat…

26:58.785 --> 26:59.912
What?

27:00.495 --> 27:02.497
…then get out of my fucking kitchen.

27:02.581 --> 27:05.667
-Dorothy, my show's about to come on.
-Shut up, Sean. It's being recorded.

27:05.751 --> 27:08.212
We are live on the scene in Chester

27:08.295 --> 27:11.131
to keep you informed about
the dangerous scene that's unfolding.

27:11.965 --> 27:14.760
Jeremy was supposed to have this story.

27:14.843 --> 27:18.764
But now he's got the flu or something,
so Isabelle's got it.

27:18.847 --> 27:21.225
Shots were fired
from inside the house by the suspects.

27:21.308 --> 27:23.060
She deserves to be there, Dorothy.

27:23.143 --> 27:25.395
If you're just tuning in,
what started as a simple arrest

27:25.479 --> 27:28.315
has escalated into what is now a standoff.

27:28.398 --> 27:32.694
Agents tell us that there are at least
three armed suspects inside the house.

27:32.778 --> 27:35.113
This is a very tense situation.

27:35.197 --> 27:37.908
This is the type of situation
that can escalate into violence

27:37.991 --> 27:39.409
at a moment's notice.

27:40.577 --> 27:43.497
-Get down. Come on. Follow me. Go, go, go.
-Get outta here now!

27:44.915 --> 27:49.378
Of course there's gunfire. I mean,
I have set this girl up to take my job.

27:50.003 --> 27:51.463
I should be there.

27:52.756 --> 27:55.717
Stay down.
Don't move any closer, all right?

27:55.801 --> 27:58.303
You'll be safe here. Just stay here.
Thanks. All right.

27:59.471 --> 28:03.100
So, as you just heard, someone from inside
the house has just started shooting.

28:03.183 --> 28:05.352
We have an active shooter situation.

28:05.435 --> 28:07.437
But we will continue to safely cover--

28:09.982 --> 28:11.108
Shit!

28:11.191 --> 28:13.986
Columbus! Call an ambulance.

28:14.069 --> 28:16.071
-He's got a gun!
-Holy shit.

28:16.154 --> 28:18.115
-She's not responding.
-Did we just see her die?

28:19.116 --> 28:20.951
Thank God you weren't there, Dorothy.
