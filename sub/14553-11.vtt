00:51.530 --> 00:55.768
I heard that ducks have one hole.

00:55.881 --> 00:58.639
I don't know if you know that,
but ducks have one hole,

00:58.752 --> 01:00.508
and they pee out of it

01:00.621 --> 01:02.476
and they shit out of it,

01:02.589 --> 01:05.147
they get... in it

01:05.260 --> 01:08.482
and they lay eggs out of it.

01:08.595 --> 01:10.117
That...

01:10.230 --> 01:13.387
has got to be one smelly,
dirty hole.

01:13.500 --> 01:17.472
That hole has got to
be a pretty awful place.

01:20.572 --> 01:23.996
I feel a little bard for
the man duck,

01:24.109 --> 01:25.696
because ducks are monogamous.

01:25.809 --> 01:26.997
I don't know if you know that,

01:27.110 --> 01:28.766
but ducks stay in their
relationships forever

01:28.879 --> 01:32.038
and by the time
that duck gets to be 48,

01:32.151 --> 01:33.172
her husband must be like,

01:33.285 --> 01:35.052
"Dude...

01:37.823 --> 01:38.945
"... that shit sucks.

01:39.058 --> 01:41.215
I hate it."

01:41.328 --> 01:44.651
And then he goes and ( bleep )
a swan or something.

01:44.764 --> 01:47.421
His wife's like, "Why do you
have to ( bleep ) a swan for ?"

01:47.534 --> 01:49.322
She's got an asshole, that's why.

01:49.435 --> 01:52.068
She's got an asshole.

01:52.181 --> 01:53.181
Okay?

01:53.294 --> 01:54.772
I got a green head.

02:00.479 --> 02:02.801
I don't know what
that means, just somehow...

02:02.914 --> 02:05.971
They got green heads,
they deserve more.

02:06.084 --> 02:09.474
Speaking of animal-type humor
that's not totally finished,

02:09.587 --> 02:12.522
uh, I...

02:14.493 --> 02:16.415
... I actually, I have
this "joke-joke,"

02:16.528 --> 02:17.750
like a, you know,

02:17.863 --> 02:19.986
"animals talking to each other"
type joke,

02:20.099 --> 02:21.221
that I don't know
how to finish it.

02:21.334 --> 02:23.156
I know what's funny about it,

02:23.269 --> 02:24.324
but I don't know how to
finish it.

02:24.437 --> 02:26.226
What--
Basically, it's about a lion

02:26.339 --> 02:28.395
who goes up to the giraffe

02:28.508 --> 02:32.866
and he says, "Hey, man,
did you see that dude ?"

02:32.979 --> 02:34.267
And the giraffe's like,
"What dude ?"

02:34.380 --> 02:35.568
And he goes, "He's that dude,

02:35.681 --> 02:38.637
"he lives by the river
in a hut."

02:38.750 --> 02:40.472
And the giraffe goes,
"What does he look like ?"

02:40.592 --> 02:42.476
And the lion goes,
"He looks like this..."

02:47.458 --> 02:48.980
And the giraffe's like,
"Well, I know a dude

02:49.093 --> 02:51.682
that lives by the river,
but he doesn't look like that."

02:51.795 --> 02:54.986
He goes, "No, that's what
he looks like, 'Ahhh !'"

02:55.099 --> 02:57.768
The giraffe says, "I know
a guy, but he looks like this."

02:59.504 --> 03:02.106
See, the lion just thinks that
people look like that.

03:05.411 --> 03:08.267
The lion doesn't
get that he makes

03:08.380 --> 03:10.904
a person look like that...

03:11.017 --> 03:12.638
by scaring the shit out of them.

03:12.751 --> 03:14.140
He just thinks that,

03:14.253 --> 03:15.574
"Hey, that's that dude that's
always going, 'Ahhh !'"

03:15.687 --> 03:18.444
That's what he's like.

03:18.557 --> 03:21.750
He doesn't see his own part of...

03:29.631 --> 03:31.320
Hello, Daddy.
Hey, baby, how you doing?

03:31.433 --> 03:32.850
Hi.
Hi.

03:32.870 --> 03:34.927
You need to take home
the ducklings tonight.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.255
Take what?

03:36.375 --> 03:37.923
We're raising ducklings

03:38.036 --> 03:39.037
and they can't
stay in the school,

03:39.150 --> 03:40.899
so you gotta take 'em.

03:41.012 --> 03:43.402
Yay, can we--
No, no, wait, wait, wait, no, no, this is not--

03:43.515 --> 03:44.603
Why me, why am I doing this?

03:44.716 --> 03:46.231
Every family took a turn,
it's your turn.

03:46.344 --> 03:47.344
Yeah, but I--
I'm going to--

03:47.457 --> 03:49.208
I'm going to Afghanistan.

03:49.321 --> 03:51.210
It's your turn to take the ducklings.
We can put them in a bathtub.

03:51.323 --> 03:53.045
Yeah, but listen, I have tomorrow morning--
And they can sleep in my bed!

03:53.158 --> 03:54.980
Excuse me, Jane, baby.

03:55.093 --> 03:57.049
Tomorrow morning, I have--
I'm starting a USO tour,

03:57.162 --> 03:58.250
do you understand?

03:58.363 --> 03:59.618
I'm going all over
the Middle East.

03:59.731 --> 04:01.220
I'm going to Iraq
and Afghanistan and Kuwait.

04:01.333 --> 04:03.689
Are you dropping Jane here tomorrow morning?
Yes, I am.

04:03.802 --> 04:07.827
Well, so take 'em
and bring 'em back tomorrow.

04:07.940 --> 04:09.127
Yay!
Yes!

04:09.240 --> 04:10.829
Yes!
Yay!

04:10.942 --> 04:12.264
Yes!

04:12.377 --> 04:14.199
Yeah.
We can put them in the bathtub!

04:14.312 --> 04:15.968
Yeah, whatever.
We gotta give 'em a bath!

04:16.081 --> 04:17.915
All right, come on.
Yeah, they can sleep in my bed.

04:19.217 --> 04:20.317
Look how...

04:21.485 --> 04:22.540
Oh!

04:22.653 --> 04:24.041
Don't let 'em go--
Yay!

04:24.154 --> 04:25.643
Okay, okay, don't let 'em go--

04:25.756 --> 04:27.478
Don't let 'em go under
there, please.

04:27.591 --> 04:29.092
Jane.

04:31.262 --> 04:34.185
No, I wanna keep this one...

04:34.298 --> 04:35.397
Look at them, they're--

04:35.510 --> 04:36.510
Careful, you're gonna
step on them.

04:36.623 --> 04:38.056
Okay, okay, please.
No, I won't.

04:38.169 --> 04:39.958
Please, Lilly,
put that one down, put...

04:40.071 --> 04:42.060
Wait.

04:42.173 --> 04:43.361
Thank you for letting them come home with us.
Ew, I got poop!

04:43.474 --> 04:45.063
All right, I'm glad--

04:45.176 --> 04:47.092
All right, girls.

04:47.205 --> 04:48.205
Good night.

04:48.318 --> 04:49.734
Daddy?
Yeah.

04:49.847 --> 04:51.369
Can we keep the ducklings?

04:51.482 --> 04:53.738
No, we're not doing that.

04:53.851 --> 04:55.307
Can we keep just one?

04:55.420 --> 04:56.474
No.

04:56.587 --> 04:58.643
Just one!
No.

04:58.756 --> 05:02.210
<i>Daddy,</i> can we keep
just one duckling?

05:03.795 --> 05:06.451
Are you really
going to a war tomorrow?

05:06.740 --> 05:09.063
I'm going to where
there is a war,

05:09.176 --> 05:12.066
but I'm just there to--
to make some soldiers laugh.

05:12.179 --> 05:14.202
I'm just gonna do shows
and it's safe.

05:14.315 --> 05:15.870
Are you sure?

05:15.983 --> 05:18.273
They've never let any
performer get hurt, ever,

05:18.386 --> 05:20.142
so it's gonna be okay.

05:20.255 --> 05:21.477
Okay.

05:21.590 --> 05:22.812
Yeah.

05:22.925 --> 05:24.414
Just one duckling?

05:24.527 --> 05:26.616
Dude, no.

05:26.729 --> 05:28.384
Oh.

05:28.497 --> 05:30.052
Could we keep them
for another night?

05:30.165 --> 05:31.853
Tomorrow morning, I'm taking
you guys to school

05:31.966 --> 05:33.255
with the ducklings

05:33.368 --> 05:35.890
and I'm going right from
the school to an airfield

05:36.003 --> 05:39.093
where I'm getting on a huge
gray plane called a C-17

05:39.206 --> 05:41.862
and I'm flying
to the Middle East.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.831
Whoa.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.132
Are we going on the plane?

05:45.245 --> 05:46.366
You're not going on--

05:46.479 --> 05:48.469
Your mom's picking you up
tomorrow at school.

05:48.582 --> 05:51.572
Can I keep just one duckling?

05:51.685 --> 05:52.707
Good night.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.654
Good night, Daddy.

06:37.367 --> 06:38.937
Y'know, for a bunch of tiny
creatures, you guys are

06:39.057 --> 06:40.767
a real pain in the ass.

06:42.853 --> 06:45.376
If this was a toilet, I would
just flush it, I swear to God.

08:16.004 --> 08:17.538
So how long have you
been there?

08:20.041 --> 08:21.096
Since I graduated high school.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.231
Oh, really.

08:22.344 --> 08:23.474
A real long time.

08:23.587 --> 08:26.010
So do you-- do you--
do you like music?

08:26.123 --> 08:28.378
Yeah, I like music.

08:28.491 --> 08:30.413
What kind of music do you like?

08:30.526 --> 08:33.516
Um, pretty much everything.

08:33.629 --> 08:35.851
Do you like, um...

08:35.964 --> 08:37.418
do you like Led Zeppelin or...

08:37.531 --> 08:39.487
Led Zeppelin?

08:39.600 --> 08:42.389
You don't know who that is?
No.

08:42.502 --> 08:43.723
What about like--

08:43.836 --> 08:46.191
Van Halen, you like Van Halen?

08:46.304 --> 08:47.893
No.

08:48.006 --> 08:49.394
You don't like them
or you don't know 'em?

08:49.507 --> 08:51.629
I'm not sure who they are, no.

08:51.742 --> 08:53.431
What about Aerosmith?

08:53.544 --> 08:55.399
You like Aerosmith?

08:55.512 --> 08:56.600
No.

08:56.713 --> 08:59.302
You don't know who they--
No, not sure.

08:59.415 --> 09:03.373
Uh, Steven Tyler, y'know,
is in Aerosmith.

09:03.486 --> 09:05.141
"American Idol."
Yeah.

09:05.254 --> 09:07.843
Yeah, I know who Steven Tyler is.

09:07.956 --> 09:10.145
He was in Aerosmith, he was
in a band called Aerosmith.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.513
Yeah, he's a judge on
"American Idol."

09:11.626 --> 09:12.814
Yeah, he is.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.182
But, uh--

09:14.295 --> 09:17.152
You're a cheerleader?
Yeah.

09:17.265 --> 09:19.086
Football-- like a football
cheerleader?

09:19.199 --> 09:20.988
Mm-hmm, yeah.

09:21.101 --> 09:22.255
You ever date any
football players?

09:22.368 --> 09:23.523
Oh, no, no, no.

09:23.636 --> 09:25.992
We're not allowed to date
any football players.

09:26.105 --> 09:27.839
Do you ever do it anyway?

09:33.880 --> 09:36.236
I didn't-- I...

09:36.349 --> 09:40.507
Hello and welcome to
Task Force Base Charlie.

09:40.620 --> 09:44.578
I'm General Thompson in charge
of operations in Afghanistan.

09:44.691 --> 09:46.881
Let me be the first to
thank you for coming here.

09:46.994 --> 09:48.949
I know it's been a long trip.

09:49.062 --> 09:51.084
I'd like to be able to
tell you to get some rest,

09:51.197 --> 09:52.552
but I can't.

09:52.665 --> 09:55.855
We need to get you out there
and cheer up our troops.

09:55.968 --> 09:58.124
You're gonna see some
things in the next five days

09:58.237 --> 10:01.427
that you've never seen
or imagined.

10:01.540 --> 10:02.728
These young people of ours

10:02.841 --> 10:05.398
are living in some
pretty bad conditions.

10:05.511 --> 10:08.767
In fact, for many of them,
it sucks out there.

10:08.880 --> 10:11.337
Some of our
forward operating bases

10:11.450 --> 10:14.341
or FOBs, as you'll come to
know them,

10:14.454 --> 10:18.312
have little more than a pot
to piss in and dry, cold food.

10:18.425 --> 10:20.849
Many of our troops are in
their second year.

10:20.962 --> 10:24.153
Most of them have lost a buddy.

10:24.266 --> 10:26.222
Some of them have
been wounded in action,

10:26.335 --> 10:28.491
returned for more.

10:28.604 --> 10:31.328
We can't give them
the comforts of home.

10:31.441 --> 10:33.763
We can't send them home.

10:33.876 --> 10:35.498
The only thing that
we can hope to do

10:35.611 --> 10:38.835
is try and lift their spirits.

10:38.948 --> 10:42.239
So you see, your job here
is terribly important.

10:42.352 --> 10:45.309
This is not
a joke to us or a trifle.

10:45.422 --> 10:48.046
This is a vital mission

10:48.159 --> 10:49.681
and I thank you most sincerely

10:49.794 --> 10:54.152
for taking time from your
family to come here and do this.

10:54.265 --> 10:56.321
Now we need to have you
go to your quarters,

10:56.434 --> 10:59.191
drop your gear, grab what
you need, get on transport.

10:59.304 --> 11:00.987
Your first destination
will be Alpha Camp

11:01.100 --> 11:02.100
where you are going to entertain

11:02.213 --> 11:04.098
about a thousand troops.

11:04.211 --> 11:06.467
They are excited to see you.

11:06.580 --> 11:08.536
You'll be sleeping
for about three hours

11:08.649 --> 11:10.804
and then we're gonna pack you
onto Black Hawk helicopters

11:10.917 --> 11:13.908
in pairs and fly you out
to the FOBs.

11:14.021 --> 11:15.742
I'm not going to lie to you.

11:15.855 --> 11:19.412
These are dangerous places
in remote mountain regions.

11:19.525 --> 11:20.880
We've got guys in the mountains

11:20.993 --> 11:23.549
firing rockets into these camps
all the time

11:23.662 --> 11:24.983
and whenever a Black Hawk lands,

11:25.096 --> 11:26.652
it increases the vue
of the target

11:26.765 --> 11:29.454
by about a billion dollars.

11:29.567 --> 11:31.690
So some of you
may take some fire,

11:31.803 --> 11:33.559
but we know where it's
coming from,

11:33.672 --> 11:36.062
we know how to protect you,

11:36.175 --> 11:38.064
so don't worry.

11:38.177 --> 11:40.666
Thanks again for coming,
and drive on.

11:40.779 --> 11:42.147
Gentlemen.

11:48.622 --> 11:50.044
Did he say we're taking fire?

11:50.157 --> 11:52.179
What does that--
Oh, no, no, don't worry, we'll be fine.

11:52.292 --> 11:53.893
Nothing to worry about.

12:08.741 --> 12:10.375
You're a comedian, sir?
Yeah.

12:11.810 --> 12:13.099
Did you see me
on TV or something?

12:13.212 --> 12:14.445
No, sir, I haven't.

12:26.124 --> 12:27.759
What the ( bleep )?

12:38.305 --> 12:41.942
"Dear Daddy, this duckling will
keep you safe, Lilly."

12:50.719 --> 12:53.821
Holy shit on the tits of a dog.

13:01.328 --> 13:02.917
Hey, man.
Hey.

13:03.030 --> 13:04.351
How are you?
Good, okay.

13:04.464 --> 13:05.819
Kenny Thomas.
Louie.

13:05.932 --> 13:07.287
It looks like they got you
and me going out together.

13:07.400 --> 13:09.422
Yeah.
Yeah.

13:09.535 --> 13:11.258
All right.

13:11.371 --> 13:13.126
Have-- have you
done this before?

13:13.239 --> 13:14.428
Once or twice.

13:14.541 --> 13:16.496
I used to-- I used to
be in the military.

13:16.609 --> 13:18.266
I was a--
I was a ranger.

13:19.847 --> 13:20.535
You all right?

13:20.648 --> 13:21.903
You look scared.

13:22.016 --> 13:23.906
Yeah, is that stupid?

13:24.019 --> 13:25.820
No, man, you'd be
stupid not to be.

13:28.291 --> 13:32.548
Yeah, never ever go in
a hostile area unarmed.

13:32.661 --> 13:34.016
All right, so we'll see you
on the flight line?

13:34.129 --> 13:35.351
Okay, man.
All right.

13:35.464 --> 13:36.530
See ya.
Yeah.

14:00.457 --> 14:02.180
Come here, come here...

14:02.293 --> 14:03.748
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

14:03.861 --> 14:06.851
It's okay, it's okay...

14:06.964 --> 14:09.399
You're okay, you're okay.

15:14.867 --> 15:15.956
My name's Kenny.

15:16.069 --> 15:17.535
Thanks.

15:20.642 --> 15:22.876
Kenny Thomas, everybody,
let's hear it for him.

15:24.679 --> 15:26.547
You guys ready to be entertained
by some cheerleaders?

15:29.384 --> 15:31.673
Let's make 'em feel
at home here in Afghanistan.

15:31.786 --> 15:34.788
Ladies and gentlemen,
Jamie and Ashley!

16:04.952 --> 16:06.073
... to Afghanistan.

16:06.186 --> 16:08.186
Ladies and gentlemen,
Louie C.K.

16:15.528 --> 16:17.083
Thank you very much.

16:17.196 --> 16:19.485
How you guys-- how are--
how are you guys doing?

16:19.598 --> 16:20.687
Good!

16:20.800 --> 16:22.967
Okay, okay, I was...

16:25.171 --> 16:26.826
I don't do a lot
to improve myself.

16:26.939 --> 16:29.529
You know, you guys are all
young, you're healthy.

16:29.642 --> 16:33.100
I've reached a point where
I could never be healthy again.

16:33.213 --> 16:37.771
Like I-- I work out
to keep this.

16:37.884 --> 16:40.341
That's the best
that I can hope for,

16:40.454 --> 16:41.743
that I won't have--
I'll keep--

16:41.856 --> 16:43.478
I'll always have this belly,

16:43.591 --> 16:46.581
I have to work hard so I won't
have another one.

16:46.694 --> 16:49.517
Like those-- that second
crotch belly that people--

16:49.630 --> 16:52.654
You ever see the guy who's got
like a ( bleep ) second belly?

16:52.767 --> 16:55.557
It's like a-- I'll be like
a letter "B."

16:55.670 --> 16:58.192
Just that belly
and it's just-- Uhh!

16:58.305 --> 16:59.593
And it's--

16:59.706 --> 17:01.895
And my penis will just be
hidden somewhere in there.

17:02.008 --> 17:04.398
You ever seen somebody
with like a second--

17:04.511 --> 17:05.532
It's a gut. And a--

17:05.645 --> 17:07.134
Yeah, and then you can't--

17:07.247 --> 17:09.136
When he pees,
it just dribbles down

17:09.249 --> 17:11.605
the front of his belly

17:11.718 --> 17:12.773
and when get gets horny,

17:12.886 --> 17:15.075
he just ( bleep ) his fat
from the inside.

17:15.188 --> 17:17.244
That's the kind of
person I'm talking about.

17:17.357 --> 17:19.614
Now, that's what mine is
become like, it just--

17:19.727 --> 17:21.583
My dick, it just--

17:21.696 --> 17:24.420
The whole dick and balls
just looks like--

17:24.533 --> 17:27.357
It's like an old horse
that nobody brushes anymore.

17:27.470 --> 17:28.703
You know?

17:32.808 --> 17:35.365
My balls...

17:35.478 --> 17:37.534
Like, my balls are like--

17:37.647 --> 17:40.370
I'm 43, my balls
are like 72 years old.

17:40.483 --> 17:42.672
They're seriously older than me.

17:42.785 --> 17:44.107
My balls, just--
they just kinda--

17:44.220 --> 17:45.375
They're like...

17:45.488 --> 17:47.076
they're like two
just John McCains

17:47.189 --> 17:49.157
just hanging from my--
they're just...

17:51.293 --> 17:53.015
They-- they hang like--

17:53.128 --> 17:54.918
They look like they're being
rescued from a river

17:55.031 --> 17:56.899
by a helicopter,
that's what they...

17:59.035 --> 18:01.191
It's very sad.

18:01.304 --> 18:02.860
I still love women.

18:02.973 --> 18:04.062
I love women.

18:04.175 --> 18:05.363
I wanna ( bleep ) women.

18:05.476 --> 18:06.865
That's-- For guys,
that's their--

18:06.978 --> 18:08.600
It's both things.

18:08.713 --> 18:10.135
It's very sad.

18:10.248 --> 18:12.530
Guys can't really can't be
romantic without being sexual.

18:12.643 --> 18:13.644
It's the way we--

18:13.757 --> 18:16.451
That's the way we're built.

18:16.564 --> 18:17.565
That's the way we're designed.

18:17.678 --> 18:19.544
We have to be that way

18:19.657 --> 18:21.680
because we have to
( bleep ) women

18:21.793 --> 18:23.281
and you have to be kind of gross

18:23.394 --> 18:25.283
to climb on a perfectly
beautiful woman

18:25.396 --> 18:28.286
and ( bleep ) her
and ruin her with your penis.

18:28.399 --> 18:30.988
You have to have kind of
a gross mentality.

18:31.101 --> 18:32.723
Women get to be
elegant during sex,

18:32.836 --> 18:35.019
they get to lay back with their
hair arranged on the pillow.

18:35.132 --> 18:36.133
"Ooh !"

18:36.246 --> 18:37.662
Even women that are aggressive,

18:37.775 --> 18:39.297
they get to ride with their
hair up,

18:39.410 --> 18:40.431
"Mmm !"

18:40.544 --> 18:43.301
They get to go for a ride.

18:43.414 --> 18:45.270
But guys just climb on and--

18:45.383 --> 18:46.397
We just--

18:46.510 --> 18:47.511
"Uhh."

18:47.624 --> 18:50.108
We have to be gross.

18:50.221 --> 18:51.710
"Gotta prosecute the pussy."

18:51.823 --> 18:55.981
That's the kind of idiot
you have to be to be a man.

18:56.094 --> 18:58.216
Get on the dick train, bitches!

18:58.329 --> 18:59.830
That's how dumb you have to be.

19:05.770 --> 19:07.426
Here you go, guys.
Thanks, Lou. Thank you.

19:07.539 --> 19:08.960
Do you still work with Jim Norton?

19:09.073 --> 19:10.507
It was good to meet you,
take care of yourself.

19:13.170 --> 19:14.171
Are you, you a Gator?

19:14.284 --> 19:15.366
Oh, hell no.

19:15.479 --> 19:17.468
I'm a Georgia Bulldog.

19:17.581 --> 19:19.582
What's your name, man?
Ryan.

19:21.852 --> 19:23.519
That was so good!

19:25.255 --> 19:26.871
That was awesome!

19:26.984 --> 19:27.984
You are really good.

19:28.097 --> 19:29.179
Hey, what's your name?
Ryan.

19:29.292 --> 19:30.347
Hey, Ryan, how's it going?
Good, sir.

19:30.460 --> 19:31.482
Sign that for you?

19:31.595 --> 19:33.384
Oh, you got a--
That's Kenny's.

19:33.497 --> 19:36.921
We sure appreciate
y'all being here.

19:37.034 --> 19:38.634
Thanks for letting us come.

19:40.104 --> 19:41.826
I never knew
a cheerleader--

19:41.939 --> 19:43.662
I never knew a cheerleader,
like, personally.

19:43.775 --> 19:45.331
I mean, I-- There were
girls in my high school

19:45.444 --> 19:47.933
who were cheerleaders that I knew

19:48.046 --> 19:49.502
who they were,
but they never--

19:49.615 --> 19:51.470
I never...

19:51.583 --> 19:53.272
It's cool, though,
it's like you're--

19:53.385 --> 19:55.373
Like an artist, you know, right?

19:55.486 --> 19:58.110
'Cause you dance and...

19:58.223 --> 20:00.779
Did you go to--
did you study dance or...

20:00.892 --> 20:03.493
Y'all are kind of disgusting,
the things you say on stage.

20:08.866 --> 20:11.189
Yeah, yeah, I guess so.

20:11.302 --> 20:14.259
Why can't you say Christian
things and be funny?

20:14.372 --> 20:17.362
Christian things?

20:17.475 --> 20:21.178
What kind of-- what kind of
Christian things are funny?

20:28.522 --> 20:30.978
How old are you?
19.

20:31.091 --> 20:32.546
You wanna see something?

20:32.659 --> 20:33.826
Ew, what?

20:46.839 --> 20:48.761
Oh, my gosh!

20:48.874 --> 20:51.164
That is so cute!

20:51.277 --> 20:52.832
Can I hold him?
No, no, no.

20:52.945 --> 20:54.133
Maybe later.

20:54.246 --> 20:55.569
Why do you have that?

20:55.682 --> 20:57.550
Well, my daughter
put it in my bag.

20:57.717 --> 20:59.740
She said it's to keep me safe.

20:59.853 --> 21:01.809
That is adorable.

21:01.922 --> 21:03.611
Well, it's not gonna
help against an RPG,

21:03.724 --> 21:05.558
but it's a pretty bad-ass
duckling.

21:07.794 --> 21:08.883
See?

21:08.996 --> 21:10.763
You're being Christian and funny.

21:17.371 --> 21:19.327
Would you ever date a guy my age?

21:19.440 --> 21:21.662
Why?
Would you ever date a 19-year-old?

21:21.775 --> 21:22.997
Sure.

21:23.110 --> 21:24.410
Would you really?

21:26.880 --> 21:28.536
Yeah.

21:28.649 --> 21:29.815
That's disgusting.

24:14.280 --> 24:16.470
What's up, fellas?

24:16.797 --> 24:19.053
How's it going?

24:19.166 --> 24:21.322
Welcome to Camp Timothy, sir.
Thanks, good to be here.

24:21.435 --> 24:23.057
Where are we?
Camp Timothy, sir.

24:23.170 --> 24:24.170
Who's Timothy?

24:26.006 --> 24:27.361
Incoming rocket fire, take cover!

24:27.474 --> 24:28.674
Incoming!

24:39.586 --> 24:40.708
They can't hit shit, don't worry.

24:40.821 --> 24:42.476
Come on, let's go to work.

24:42.589 --> 24:43.856
That's funny?

24:48.695 --> 24:49.750
How you doing?

24:49.863 --> 24:52.286
Camp Timothy, sir.
Thank you very much.

24:52.399 --> 24:53.587
How you doing?

24:53.700 --> 24:54.822
Excellent, sir, how you doing?

24:54.935 --> 24:56.490
You guys live here?

24:56.603 --> 24:58.302
Unfortunately.

24:58.415 --> 24:59.415
Yeah.

24:59.528 --> 25:00.928
How long you been here for?

25:01.041 --> 25:02.897
Uh, well, we built this FOB
about a year ago

25:03.010 --> 25:05.332
and we've been here ever since.

25:05.445 --> 25:07.468
You got cable?

25:07.581 --> 25:09.403
Not out here, sir.

25:09.516 --> 25:11.205
Sir, this is our company
commander, Major Burroughs.

25:11.318 --> 25:12.685
Hello, sir.

25:15.655 --> 25:17.211
Afghani Nationals.

25:17.324 --> 25:18.691
We're training 'em.

25:20.493 --> 25:21.994
Hey, guys, how's it going?

25:24.064 --> 25:25.064
Hi.

25:28.101 --> 25:29.123
Incoming!

25:29.236 --> 25:30.302
Incoming!

25:32.206 --> 25:33.406
All right.

25:36.210 --> 25:37.812
Hey, guys, let's
square this place away.

25:39.981 --> 25:41.404
We're gonna...

25:41.517 --> 25:42.638
we're gonna do a show in here?

25:42.751 --> 25:44.340
Yeah.

25:44.453 --> 25:45.920
Dude.

25:47.490 --> 25:49.012
It's all right,
you just tell your jokes,

25:49.125 --> 25:50.346
I'll sing a song, it'll be cool.

25:50.459 --> 25:51.493
They're gonna love you.

26:00.836 --> 26:02.158
Hey, fellas.

26:02.271 --> 26:05.762
Thanks for being here,
not that you have a choice.

26:05.875 --> 26:08.298
But my name's Louie C.K.,
I'm a comedian.

26:08.411 --> 26:09.467
Never d heard of you.

26:09.580 --> 26:11.535
I never heard of
you either, dickface.

26:11.648 --> 26:13.738
Listen, I'm not afraid of
you guys,

26:13.851 --> 26:15.984
you got guns,
you're only 21, though,

26:16.097 --> 26:17.098
I'm 43.

26:17.211 --> 26:18.944
I got a lot of years on you,

26:19.057 --> 26:21.246
so we're gonna have a good time.

26:21.359 --> 26:22.781
I'm gonna tell you a few jokes,
try to make you laugh,

26:22.894 --> 26:25.316
but first a little music.

26:25.429 --> 26:28.686
This is a young man who is one
of your own, first of all,

26:28.799 --> 26:31.622
he's an Army Ranger and he's
a country-western singer.

26:31.735 --> 26:33.224
I'm not sure which one's worse,

26:33.337 --> 26:35.025
but let's find out
what he can do.

26:35.138 --> 26:37.094
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
a nice welcome for Kenny Thomas.

26:37.207 --> 26:38.207
Give him a hand.

26:43.312 --> 26:45.001
Hey, how y'all doing?
Hey.

26:45.114 --> 26:46.837
Thanks for coming out of your
holes in the ground

26:46.950 --> 26:48.606
and spending some time with us.

26:48.719 --> 26:50.542
We appreciate you spending
the day with us.

26:50.655 --> 26:52.430
We appreciate ya.

26:52.550 --> 26:53.741
I wanna do a song for you.

26:54.892 --> 26:57.715
It's from my father's generation.

26:57.828 --> 26:59.084
Now, I don't know
how many of you guys

26:59.197 --> 27:01.186
have been up to the Vietnam Wall
in Washington, DC.

27:01.299 --> 27:02.815
But when one of
our service members

27:02.935 --> 27:05.791
was listing as a POW...

27:05.904 --> 27:07.192
or missing in action,

27:07.305 --> 27:11.096
what they would do is
put a cross by their name.

27:11.209 --> 27:13.198
And in the event that that man
was to make it back alive

27:13.311 --> 27:14.466
and accounted for,

27:14.579 --> 27:16.668
they'd put a circle
around the cross

27:16.781 --> 27:20.006
and that would
signify the circle of life.

27:20.119 --> 27:22.441
And you can look all you want,
but to this day,

27:22.554 --> 27:24.243
there's still no circles

27:24.356 --> 27:26.023
inscribed on the Vietnam Wall.

Thanks, you guys, appreciate it.

29:27.697 --> 29:29.019
God bless you guys,
and we mean it.

29:29.132 --> 29:30.654
Take care of each other and come
on home safe, all right?

29:30.767 --> 29:32.689
All right, I want
to introduce a guy,

29:32.802 --> 29:33.957
he's a very funny man

29:34.070 --> 29:35.659
and he came a long way
to make you ugh,

29:35.772 --> 29:38.329
so, you know, make him
feel good about himself.

29:38.442 --> 29:40.042
Please give it up for Louie?

29:41.645 --> 29:43.100
All right.

29:43.213 --> 29:45.436
Thank you, Kenny, for depressing
the shit out of everybody

29:45.549 --> 29:48.050
and now I gotta
try to make 'em laugh.

29:49.252 --> 29:50.741
Well, I live in New York City.

29:50.854 --> 29:52.142
Anybody here from New York,
New Yorkers?

29:52.255 --> 29:53.344
New York?

29:53.457 --> 29:54.244
What kind--
what part of New York?

29:54.357 --> 29:55.579
Buffalo.

29:55.692 --> 29:57.648
Buffalo, that's not New York.

29:57.761 --> 29:59.717
Dude, don't mess with Buffalo.

29:59.830 --> 30:01.419
Hey, man, it's okay.

30:01.532 --> 30:02.754
I understand how Buffalo's--

30:02.867 --> 30:04.689
That's home.

30:04.802 --> 30:06.758
I don't wanna mess with
your home.

30:06.871 --> 30:08.605
But seriously,
Buffalo sucks shit.

30:09.974 --> 30:11.162
I mean, come on, man.

30:11.275 --> 30:12.697
You gotta have some
courage to live here,

30:12.810 --> 30:15.367
but you gotta have more courage
to live in Buffalo.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.669
I think if I woke up
at a bus stop in Buffalo,

30:17.782 --> 30:18.782
I would kill myself.

30:21.085 --> 30:22.907
The only thing
worse than being in Buffalo

30:23.020 --> 30:24.476
is being in a hotel room

30:24.589 --> 30:26.345
trying to find how far you can
get your finger

30:26.458 --> 30:27.913
into your own asshole.

30:28.026 --> 30:32.851
That's actually more fun than
being in shit, horrible--

30:32.964 --> 30:34.453
Do you know that
there was a president

30:34.566 --> 30:36.021
who was shot in downtown Buffalo

30:36.134 --> 30:37.289
and his last words were,

30:37.402 --> 30:38.657
"Thank God I can get
the ( bleep ) out of

30:38.770 --> 30:40.604
this shitty town."

31:18.304 --> 31:19.305
Can I see it?
Hey.

31:19.418 --> 31:20.762
Yeah, come over.

31:22.921 --> 31:23.921
So cute.

31:24.034 --> 31:24.788
How old is your daughter?

31:24.901 --> 31:26.156
She's five.

31:26.269 --> 31:27.970
And I got
a nine-year-old.

31:31.108 --> 31:32.909
Pour water for this thing.

31:36.814 --> 31:39.871
You're a good dad.

31:39.984 --> 31:41.251
Thank you.

31:50.093 --> 31:51.948
In actual Detroit, inside--
Detroit.

31:52.061 --> 31:54.017
Detroit.
Right in the actual...

31:54.130 --> 31:55.552
Hey, guys...

31:55.665 --> 31:57.654
Every time, what, what?

31:57.767 --> 31:59.523
Football, one more,
one more short game--

31:59.636 --> 32:01.591
No, you beat us
every single time.

32:01.704 --> 32:03.127
It's not fair.
Every time.

32:03.240 --> 32:04.521
Football.

32:04.634 --> 32:05.635
No, no, no, no, no...
Yeah, yeah.

32:05.748 --> 32:06.797
Football.

32:06.910 --> 32:07.942
That's a football.

32:08.055 --> 32:09.055
Football.

32:09.168 --> 32:10.268
You're ball.
Our ball?

32:10.381 --> 32:11.381
Oh, sweet.

32:11.516 --> 32:13.384
I give you free kick.

32:20.424 --> 32:22.180
Get it around!

32:22.293 --> 32:23.960
See, I told you.

33:54.553 --> 33:56.442
Gets to you, doesn't it?

33:56.555 --> 33:58.510
Freaking kids, man.

33:58.623 --> 33:59.924
Yeah.

34:03.095 --> 34:04.950
Still scared?

34:05.063 --> 34:06.118
No.

34:06.231 --> 34:07.953
That's right, man.

34:08.066 --> 34:09.767
'Til something bigger
comes along.

34:43.465 --> 34:44.165
What?

34:49.438 --> 34:51.026
Knock it...

34:51.139 --> 34:52.188
No!

34:52.301 --> 34:53.301
No!

34:53.414 --> 34:54.876
Prepare to land!

34:57.580 --> 34:58.880
This is fun!

35:00.416 --> 35:02.239
We're going down!
What?

35:02.352 --> 35:04.975
We're landing!

35:05.088 --> 35:07.211
That's not good!
Not--

35:07.324 --> 35:09.793
Jesus...

35:14.266 --> 35:15.799
What's happening?

35:38.107 --> 35:39.407
Good job, guys.

35:42.104 --> 35:43.104
Can somebody please tell me

35:43.217 --> 35:44.799
what is actually happening
right now?

35:44.919 --> 35:47.303
We had a mechanical problem.

35:47.416 --> 35:49.872
Well, so what--
what now happens?

35:49.985 --> 35:51.640
Hopefully someone
comes and gets us.

35:51.753 --> 35:54.009
Hopefully nothing happens
to go down.

35:55.066 --> 35:57.959
They'll be here in about
30 minutes so just sit tight.

36:00.562 --> 36:03.219
Sit tight.

36:03.332 --> 36:05.066
Okay, I'm sitting tight.

36:08.571 --> 36:11.061
I'm taking a leak.

36:11.174 --> 36:12.730
I already did that.

36:12.843 --> 36:13.909
Ew.

36:29.728 --> 36:33.285
I'm very-- I'm very
sensitive to the sun.

36:33.398 --> 36:34.687
I get burned.

36:34.800 --> 36:36.334
I'm sensitive.

36:38.797 --> 36:39.798
Oh.

36:39.911 --> 36:41.160
Uh-oh.

36:41.273 --> 36:42.407
Hey, Sergeant Major.

36:46.445 --> 36:48.534
Everyone just be calm.

36:48.647 --> 36:51.170
Hey.

36:51.283 --> 36:53.105
Is that worry--
"worryable"?

36:53.218 --> 36:55.441
Don't know yet.

36:55.554 --> 36:57.243
Dude, they got guns.

36:57.356 --> 36:58.511
Yeah.

36:58.624 --> 36:59.745
A lot of people have guns here.

36:59.858 --> 37:01.225
They might just be hunting, man.

37:10.368 --> 37:11.635
Put your weapons down!

37:18.875 --> 37:20.297
It's okay, it's okay!

37:20.410 --> 37:22.111
Drop your weapons, put 'em down!

38:03.622 --> 38:04.944
Salam alaikum, salam alaikum.

38:05.057 --> 38:05.845
Salam alaikum.

38:05.958 --> 38:07.346
Salam...

38:07.459 --> 38:10.828
Salam alaikum, salam alaikum,
salam alaikum, salam alaikum...

38:13.965 --> 38:15.265
Salam alaikum.

38:37.081 --> 38:38.236
Uh, "duckie."

38:38.349 --> 38:39.203
Duckie, duckie!

38:39.316 --> 38:40.316
Duckie.

38:41.786 --> 38:43.086
Duckie, duckie.

38:45.156 --> 38:46.177
Duckie.

38:46.290 --> 38:48.125
Duckie, duckie, duckie...

38:49.962 --> 38:51.617
It's my daughter's.
Daughter?

38:51.730 --> 38:53.198
Jane, my daughter.

39:29.764 --> 39:30.858
Yee-ha!

39:30.978 --> 39:32.399
Yee-ha!
