WEBVTT

00:09.533 --> 00:10.967
Life--it's literally
all we have.

00:11.067 --> 00:11.967
But is it any good?

00:12.067 --> 00:13.333
I'm a reviewer,

00:13.433 --> 00:14.333
but I don't review

00:14.433 --> 00:16.000
food, books, or movies.

00:16.100 --> 00:18.067
I review life itself.

00:18.167 --> 00:19.667
[screams]

00:19.767 --> 00:21.600
[triumphant music]

00:21.700 --> 00:23.300
[parrot squawks]

00:23.400 --> 00:26.833
*

00:26.933 --> 00:27.833
Over here.

00:27.933 --> 00:32.167
*

00:33.833 --> 00:34.733
Welcome to Review.

00:34.833 --> 00:36.433
I'm Forrest MacNeil,

00:36.533 --> 00:39.633
and I am completely dedicated to
exploring the life experiences

00:39.733 --> 00:40.967
you want rated.

00:41.067 --> 00:42.967
Here is the delightful
A.J. Gibbs.

00:43.067 --> 00:44.667
Hi, Forrest.

00:44.767 --> 00:46.000
I don't suppose you
have any reviews for me today.

00:46.100 --> 00:48.500
- Oh, I do.
- Great. Okay.

00:48.600 --> 00:52.333
Our first review is an email
from ChoBeatsCho97.

01:01.133 --> 01:05.067
Oh, to be falsely...
accused.

01:05.133 --> 01:07.500
Well, you know,
as a man of a certain stature,

01:07.600 --> 01:09.367
I have a lot to lose,
having charges

01:09.467 --> 01:10.933
thrown willy-nilly
in my direction.

01:11.067 --> 01:12.400
- Who's that?
- What?

01:12.500 --> 01:13.933
Who's Willy Nilly?

01:14.067 --> 01:16.367
Oh, that is not a person.

01:16.467 --> 01:20.267
I guess I'm off to be
the victim of injustice.

01:20.367 --> 01:22.600
Then why are we talking
about him?

01:22.700 --> 01:24.100
- Talking about who?
- Willy Nilly.

01:24.200 --> 01:27.467
Oh, we're not talking
about Willy Nilly.

01:27.567 --> 01:31.067
(Forrest)
In order to be falsely accused,
I would need accusers.

01:31.167 --> 01:33.900
I turned to my intern, Josh,
and his girlfriend, Tina.

01:34.067 --> 01:37.233
So this is the police blotter
for the city of Burbank.

01:37.333 --> 01:40.233
Now pick a crime on here,
any crime at all,

01:40.333 --> 01:41.700
and then accuse me of it.

01:41.800 --> 01:43.467
I don't want you to back down
no matter what,

01:43.567 --> 01:45.633
no matter what the police say,
certainly no matter what I say.

01:45.733 --> 01:48.533
Just point the finger of blame
at me, please,

01:48.633 --> 01:49.800
and keep it pointed.

01:49.900 --> 01:50.867
Okay.
Yeah, no problem.

01:50.967 --> 01:52.600
Okay, good.
See, look here.

01:52.700 --> 01:55.433
Someone's been stealing avocados
from this woman's tree.

01:55.533 --> 01:56.967
Like, that's perfect.

01:57.067 --> 01:59.767
What you doing?
Oh, you're getting started.

01:59.867 --> 02:02.600
- You know what to do?
- I think Tina's got it.

02:02.700 --> 02:05.867
(Forrest)
But very quickly, I began
to suspect I'd left this task

02:05.967 --> 02:07.633
to the wrong people.

02:07.733 --> 02:10.333
Josh and Tina seemed to be
putting off their accusation

02:10.433 --> 02:12.900
in favor of all other
manner of business.

02:13.067 --> 02:14.700
While on an outing
to buy headphones

02:14.800 --> 02:16.233
from a store
called craigslist,

02:16.333 --> 02:17.833
Tina ran out of gas.

02:17.933 --> 02:19.933
You get this at the gas station,
fill it up with gas.

02:20.067 --> 02:21.267
Well, if I'm going
to the gas station,

02:21.367 --> 02:23.067
- I'm just gonna fill it up.
- Sure.

02:23.133 --> 02:24.700
- Yes, you can hold on to that.
- Have a good day.

02:24.800 --> 02:26.533
I hope you weren't doing
anything really important.

02:26.633 --> 02:28.100
To be honest, I was not,

02:28.200 --> 02:30.900
but this is still
an inconvenience.

02:31.067 --> 02:33.100
(Forrest)
Josh, in an effort to make up
for this frustrating time suck,

02:33.200 --> 02:34.767
offered to have
my glasses fixed...

02:34.867 --> 02:36.867
Like, this side is closer
to my face than this side.

02:36.967 --> 02:38.667
(Forrest)
An errand
which I did appreciate,

02:38.767 --> 02:40.767
as they'd been crooked
ever since I was shot in them.

02:40.867 --> 02:43.100
- Here you go.
- Thank you very much.

02:43.200 --> 02:46.533
I felt useless in the meantime,
a feeling Tina tried to soothe

02:46.633 --> 02:49.267
by having me sign some responses
to our fan mail.

02:49.367 --> 02:50.767
I guess they'd get a big kick

02:50.867 --> 02:52.833
out of seeing my name
signed on there, huh?

02:52.933 --> 02:55.067
(Forrest)
I began to suspect my
coconspirators had completely

02:55.167 --> 02:56.667
forgotten their assignment.

02:56.767 --> 02:58.067
Great.
And that's just your whole name.

02:58.133 --> 02:59.567
All right.

02:59.667 --> 03:02.800
(Forrest)
I couldn't have
been more wrong.

03:02.900 --> 03:04.467
The police are here
for you.

03:04.567 --> 03:07.467
[sighs]
At last.

03:07.567 --> 03:09.333
- Are you Forrest MacNeil?
- Yes, I am.

03:09.433 --> 03:11.733
But, officers, I'm sorry to say
you've got the wrong man.

03:11.833 --> 03:13.667
I don't even like avocados.
You see, they upset my stomach.

03:13.767 --> 03:15.300
Great. You're under arrest
for arson, attempted murder...

03:15.400 --> 03:17.333
- What? No, no, no.
- And destruction of property.

03:17.433 --> 03:19.367
What are you talking about?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.067
You have the right
to remain silent.

03:21.100 --> 03:22.633
Oh, no, no.
Hey, Dad, call my lawyer, okay?

03:22.733 --> 03:24.167
Forr--
Who's your lawyer?

03:24.267 --> 03:26.300
- Call a really good lawyer.
- A realty lawyer?

03:26.400 --> 03:27.333
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

03:27.433 --> 03:28.667
one will be appointed for you.

03:28.767 --> 03:32.533
Oh, Forrest.

03:32.633 --> 03:34.633
(Forrest)
My lawyer, Daisy,
rushed to the police station.

03:34.733 --> 03:35.967
What took you so long?

03:36.067 --> 03:37.567
I couldn't find my shoes.

03:37.667 --> 03:39.367
Well, this is ridiculous.

03:39.467 --> 03:41.333
I mean, they can't possibly have
any kind of case against me.

03:41.433 --> 03:45.133
Well, I normally would
tell you not to worry, Forrest,

03:45.233 --> 03:46.867
but I think you should worry.

03:46.967 --> 03:49.067
How could it be bad? There's
no way for this to be bad.

03:49.167 --> 03:51.233
(Forrest)
To my shock and horror,

03:51.333 --> 03:53.967
I had been charged with
the incredibly serious crime

03:54.067 --> 03:55.633
of burning down
a sorority house

03:55.733 --> 03:57.733
at the University
of Southern California.

03:57.833 --> 04:00.567
They found
your fingerprints

04:00.667 --> 04:03.300
all over this container used
to pour gas on the house.

04:03.400 --> 04:04.767
Well, that ought to do it.

04:04.867 --> 04:08.600
They found eyeglasses
that match your prints

04:08.700 --> 04:10.200
and your prescription.

04:10.300 --> 04:11.867
- Here you go.
- Thank you very much.

04:11.967 --> 04:13.667
I appreciate it.
Think about it for a second.

04:13.767 --> 04:15.700
How would I have driven home
from there without my glasses?

04:15.800 --> 04:20.600
Well, you might have
a backup pair.

04:20.700 --> 04:23.300
- I do have a backup pair.
- Oh, my God.

04:23.400 --> 04:28.367
And finally, a whole series
of hand-signed hate letters.

04:28.467 --> 04:31.300
"Put a jacket on, whores."

04:31.400 --> 04:32.667
That's my signature.

04:32.767 --> 04:34.800
"Life--it's literally
all you have.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.800
"And you're a bunch
of stuck-up sluts.

04:36.900 --> 04:38.367
Signed, Forrest MacNeil."

04:38.467 --> 04:39.867
I guess
they'd get a big kick

04:39.967 --> 04:41.800
out of seeing my name
signed on there, huh?

04:41.900 --> 04:43.800
(Forrest)
Apparently, Josh and Tina
had not felt it adequate

04:43.900 --> 04:46.833
to simply point the finger at me
for a minor crime.

04:46.933 --> 04:49.067
This was supposed
to be stolen avocados.

04:49.133 --> 04:51.967
(Forrest)
Instead, they chose
the fiery destruction of a house

04:52.067 --> 04:53.867
inhabited by college girls,

04:53.967 --> 04:56.367
and they constructed
an impressively thorough trail

04:56.467 --> 04:58.333
- of evidence linking me to it.
[gavel bangs]

04:58.433 --> 05:00.400
(judge)
Forrest MacNeil,
you are charged with arson

05:00.500 --> 05:02.400
in the second degree,
attempted murder.

05:02.500 --> 05:04.700
(Forrest)
Their departure from the plan
was, to say the least...

05:04.800 --> 05:05.733
How do you plead?

05:05.833 --> 05:06.733
(Forrest)
Startling.

05:06.833 --> 05:09.567
Not guilty.

05:09.667 --> 05:11.233
How could you do that?

05:11.333 --> 05:12.500
People could've been
killed in there,

05:12.600 --> 05:14.167
and then I would be blamed
for it.

05:14.267 --> 05:15.300
I don't know what you're
talking about, Mr. MacNeil.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.167
Yeah, I had friends
in that house.

05:17.267 --> 05:19.133
Dear, dear friends.

05:19.233 --> 05:22.067
Guys, we need to drop the act
for a minute, all right,

05:22.100 --> 05:24.300
because this is
a very serious crime.

05:24.400 --> 05:29.100
This is 10 to 15 years
in jail.

05:29.200 --> 05:31.567
In jail! Do you understand
what that means?

05:31.667 --> 05:33.100
We got to figure out a way
to get me out of this, okay?

05:33.200 --> 05:35.833
No. We're not gonna
get you out of this, okay?

05:35.933 --> 05:38.233
You deserve the punishment
you get.

05:38.333 --> 05:40.733
Yeah, you're evil.

05:40.833 --> 05:43.900
Oh, oh, my God,
I just felt it.

05:44.067 --> 05:45.100
What are you talking about?

05:45.200 --> 05:46.967
She's really sensitive
to evil.

05:47.067 --> 05:48.167
You know I'm not evil. Guys,
guys, all right, all right.

05:48.267 --> 05:49.967
Hey, forget
about what I said before.

05:50.067 --> 05:51.467
Oh.

05:51.567 --> 05:56.067
- You're doing such a good job.
- [chuckles]

05:57.267 --> 05:58.733
(Forrest)
As an indicted arsonist,

05:58.833 --> 06:01.733
I now felt accusing eyes
on me wherever I went...

06:01.833 --> 06:03.667
Hi.

06:03.767 --> 06:05.467
(Forrest)
The world's suspicion
landing on my shoulders

06:05.567 --> 06:07.800
with devastating weight.

06:07.900 --> 06:10.633
Feeling alone and distrusted,

06:10.733 --> 06:13.533
I sought the support of my only
lifelong ally, my father.

06:13.633 --> 06:15.733
I did not do it.

06:15.833 --> 06:17.133
- I know.
- Thank you.

06:17.233 --> 06:20.067
- I need that.
- I believe you.

06:21.567 --> 06:25.367
But let's just say
that you did do it, you know?

06:25.467 --> 06:27.267
What did you have
against those girls?

06:27.367 --> 06:28.700
[sighs]

06:28.800 --> 06:29.700
(Forrest)
Even my dad thought me capable

06:29.800 --> 06:32.633
of sorority house arson.

06:32.733 --> 06:35.533
My lawyer and I
met to strategize my defense.

06:35.633 --> 06:37.900
They have offered
you a plea deal,

06:38.067 --> 06:39.733
and I think
it's quite generous.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.967
You would do eight years
in jail,

06:43.067 --> 06:47.200
and then
you would get out.

06:47.300 --> 06:49.267
Eight years.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.167
[sighs]

06:55.267 --> 06:56.200
(Forrest)
Before turning myself in

06:56.300 --> 06:57.633
to serve eight years in prison

06:57.733 --> 06:59.300
for a crime I did not commit,

06:59.400 --> 07:00.733
not even a little bit,

07:00.833 --> 07:02.200
there was one thing
I had not tried.

07:02.300 --> 07:03.867
Please, please, please.

07:03.967 --> 07:05.633
I am begging you.
I didn't do it.

07:05.733 --> 07:07.433
We should've had a safe word,
you guys.

07:07.533 --> 07:08.733
Something like pineapple,

07:08.833 --> 07:10.933
so I could say pineapple, guys,
pineapple.

07:11.067 --> 07:13.267
You have to tell them
I'm innocent, please.

07:13.367 --> 07:15.933
We can't tell them you're
innocent because you're guilty.

07:16.067 --> 07:17.933
You have to stop
saying that, okay?

07:18.067 --> 07:19.467
You know the truth.
Please.

07:19.567 --> 07:22.100
Mr. MacNeil, the truth is,
you wanted to kill them,

07:22.200 --> 07:23.600
so you burned down
their house.

07:23.700 --> 07:25.100
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Stop saying that.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.933
It isn't true!
You're ruining my life.

07:27.067 --> 07:28.933
Mr. MacNeil, you know
what's ruining your life?

07:29.067 --> 07:31.800
You're lying to everybody.
Stop lying. Just confess.

07:31.900 --> 07:33.867
You'll feel better
if you confess.

07:33.967 --> 07:35.533
[together]
Confess, confess, confess!

07:35.633 --> 07:36.533
Confess, confess,
confess, confess!

07:36.633 --> 07:37.867
[phone rings]

07:37.967 --> 07:39.567
(Forrest)
Then, in my darkest hour,

07:39.667 --> 07:41.933
there shone
a miraculous ray of light.

07:42.067 --> 07:44.067
Shut up! It's my lawyer.
It's my lawyer.

07:44.100 --> 07:45.933
What? Oh, God, what?
What?

07:46.067 --> 07:47.367
Oh.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.833
Oh, you're kidding me.

07:49.933 --> 07:51.833
Oh, my God.

07:51.933 --> 07:54.267
Oh, thank God.
Okay, oh, yes.

07:54.367 --> 07:56.200
Okay, bye.

07:56.300 --> 07:59.067
- The charges have been dropped.
- Really?

07:59.100 --> 08:01.267
They arrested somebody else
for it, some woman named...

08:01.367 --> 08:03.667
[together]
Tracy Mahidi.

08:03.767 --> 08:06.233
(Forrest)
As it turned out,
Tina had a psychotic roommate

08:06.333 --> 08:07.567
who told her
that she was going

08:07.667 --> 08:09.733
to set the Zeta Kappa house
on fire.

08:09.833 --> 08:11.433
Rather than warn the police,

08:11.533 --> 08:13.067
which is what
you're supposed to do,

08:13.100 --> 08:15.233
Josh and Tina framed me
for the crime.

08:15.333 --> 08:18.067
Thankfully, the crazy roommate
later confessed.

08:18.100 --> 08:19.867
All the blood went out of you,
and you were like,

08:19.967 --> 08:22.500
"Pineapple, pineapple,
pineapple."

08:22.600 --> 08:23.667
Have a really good night,
okay?

08:23.767 --> 08:25.533
I will see you.

08:31.267 --> 08:33.200
Welcome home.

08:33.300 --> 08:35.233
(Forrest)
I was relieved
to have the charges dropped,

08:35.333 --> 08:37.200
but having been brought
to the edge of serving

08:37.300 --> 08:41.067
significant time in prison
and having seen my own father

08:41.167 --> 08:43.667
believe me capable
of setting a house on fire

08:43.767 --> 08:45.333
and letting it burn,

08:45.433 --> 08:48.733
well, I felt my punishment
had already been served.

08:48.833 --> 08:51.800
Being falsely accused,
one star.

08:54.400 --> 08:57.400
Your next review
comes from Stephen Shea,

08:57.500 --> 09:00.900
a high school sophomore
in Muscatine, Iowa.

09:01.067 --> 09:02.733
Hey, Forrest,
I've got a big crush

09:02.833 --> 09:04.300
on my algebra teacher,
Mrs. Greenfield.

09:04.400 --> 09:05.967
And I keep wondering,

09:06.067 --> 09:07.633
what would it be like to have
sex with your teacher?

09:07.733 --> 09:09.467
[scoffs]

09:09.567 --> 09:11.900
You know, Stephen's curiosity
is very understandable.

09:12.067 --> 09:14.667
He'd like to know what it's like
to sleep with Mrs. Greenfield,

09:14.767 --> 09:17.067
and I'm going to find out.

09:17.100 --> 09:18.067
Oh--

09:21.933 --> 09:24.867
(Forrest)
Sleeping with Mrs. Greenfield
presented daunting challenges.

09:24.967 --> 09:27.800
I had never met her,
and she was obviously married.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.633
Oh.
She's charming.

09:29.733 --> 09:31.567
(Forrest)
But thanks to our modern
collective disinterest

09:31.667 --> 09:34.067
in privacy, I was able
to find basic information

09:34.167 --> 09:36.533
about my sex target rapidly.

09:36.633 --> 09:38.167
Yeah.

09:38.267 --> 09:40.300
It'll be a pleasure
to have sex with her.

09:40.400 --> 09:42.700
(Forrest)
For Stephen, Mrs. Greenfield's
adolescent student,

09:42.800 --> 09:46.200
she represented forbidden fruit,
an impossible conquest.

09:46.300 --> 09:47.867
For me, a divorced adult,

09:47.967 --> 09:50.500
stalking a married woman
halfway across the country,

09:50.600 --> 09:53.900
the situation
was basically the same.

09:54.067 --> 09:56.233
Mrs. Greenfield
alerted the entire world

09:56.333 --> 09:58.067
by way of the social media web

09:58.100 --> 09:59.800
that she'd be meeting
some girlfriends

09:59.900 --> 10:02.367
for '90s trivia night
at this local bar.

10:02.467 --> 10:04.733
Hey there, do you guys mind
if I join your team?

10:04.833 --> 10:06.633
I'm sorry. It's just kind of
a girl power kind of night.

10:06.733 --> 10:07.733
Can you scooch over
just a little bit there?

10:07.833 --> 10:08.967
It's just us ladies.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.367
Mind giving a little bit
of room there?

10:10.467 --> 10:12.033
You know, you'd probably
be more comfortable

10:12.133 --> 10:14.533
if you kept scooching over just
elbow room-wise--good, okay.

10:14.633 --> 10:16.367
(Forrest)
Although this predatory behavior

10:16.467 --> 10:18.200
felt wrong on many levels,

10:18.300 --> 10:21.167
I knew I had to continue,
for the good of humanity.

10:21.267 --> 10:23.133
I've been brushing up
on the '90s.

10:23.233 --> 10:26.233
I know all about, you know,
Diff'rent Strokes and Webster.

10:26.333 --> 10:28.367
I think that was the--
that's the '80s.

10:28.467 --> 10:30.133
Nancy Reagan's
"Just say no" thing,

10:30.233 --> 10:31.500
reading up on that
last night.

10:31.600 --> 10:32.500
That's the '80s as well.

10:32.600 --> 10:33.700
And the various people

10:33.800 --> 10:36.000
that got involved,
you know, with that.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.500
In the movie Office Space,

10:37.600 --> 10:40.367
what item did Peter pull
from the rubble?

10:40.467 --> 10:42.100
- Yes.
- Red scissors.

10:42.200 --> 10:44.033
- No. Anybody else?
- Red stapler.

10:44.133 --> 10:45.567
Yes, red stapler.

10:45.667 --> 10:47.033
What's the difference?
It's the same thing.

10:47.133 --> 10:48.600
Um, one's staples,
one's a scissor.

10:48.700 --> 10:50.100
Can we get half credit
for that?

10:50.200 --> 10:51.433
- No, you don't. No.
- You got the--

10:51.533 --> 10:52.933
She--
Well, you got the color right.

10:53.033 --> 10:54.933
- You got the color right.
- It's fine.

10:55.033 --> 10:56.033
(Forrest)
I paid a lot of special
attention to Mrs. Greenfield.

10:56.133 --> 10:58.100
Yes.
How did you know that?

10:58.200 --> 10:59.533
I watched a ton
of Soul Train.

10:59.633 --> 11:01.300
That is amazing.

11:01.400 --> 11:03.200
(Forrest)
And thanks to alcohol
and flattery,

11:03.300 --> 11:06.100
I was making
surprisingly good progress.

11:06.200 --> 11:08.333
Wow, that's great, so you've got
now just the two cats.

11:08.433 --> 11:10.333
- Yeah.
- Okay.

11:10.433 --> 11:12.133
(Forrest)
As the night wore on
and her friends left the bar,

11:12.233 --> 11:15.200
sex with Mrs. Greenfield
seemed more and more likely.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.167
So what's your story,
mystery man...

11:17.267 --> 11:18.300
Hmm, oh, well...

11:18.400 --> 11:19.767
With you in the middle
of nowhere?

11:19.867 --> 11:21.867
Oh, I live in Hollywood,
California, actually.

11:21.967 --> 11:24.067
(Forrest)
My knowledge that
Mrs. Greenfield had minored

11:24.133 --> 11:26.067
in drama
was a valuable asset.

11:26.100 --> 11:29.967
Has anybody ever told you
that you should actress?

11:30.067 --> 11:31.767
You mean be a, like,
be an actress?

11:31.867 --> 11:33.067
Be an actress, yeah.

11:33.133 --> 11:34.367
Well, I am one.

11:34.467 --> 11:35.867
- I do teach, but, like...
- Okay.

11:35.967 --> 11:37.633
I also actress.

11:37.733 --> 11:39.067
Do you really?

11:39.100 --> 11:40.633
I think I should
switch to waters.

11:40.733 --> 11:42.067
- I'm gonna switch to water.
- Oh, no, no, no.

11:42.100 --> 11:43.233
No, you don't, sir.

11:43.333 --> 11:45.067
I'm gonna buy you
a pitcher.

11:45.100 --> 11:47.067
- What? A pitcher?
- Yes. Here we go.

11:47.167 --> 11:49.767
(Forrest)
As our evening progressed,
I saw that Mrs. Greenfield

11:49.867 --> 11:54.200
was a dreamer being held back by
a distant and uncaring spouse,

11:54.300 --> 11:56.167
and that moved me greatly.

11:56.267 --> 11:57.767
Just pull it off.

11:57.867 --> 12:00.300
(Forrest)
That night,
I had truly glorious sex

12:00.400 --> 12:01.967
with Mrs. Greenfield.

12:02.067 --> 12:03.633
Though I do not know
what she's like in a classroom,

12:03.733 --> 12:06.100
in bed,
she is a gifted teacher,

12:06.200 --> 12:07.733
revealing to me
sexual positions

12:07.833 --> 12:10.400
that have broadened my horizons
and expanded my mind.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.967
It was amazing.

12:13.067 --> 12:15.600
My review might
have ended here

12:15.700 --> 12:17.433
but for
a surprising development.

12:17.533 --> 12:19.133
Sounds like a fun activity.

12:19.233 --> 12:21.233
Mrs. Greenfield?

12:21.333 --> 12:23.467
- Oh, hi, Stephen.
- Oh.

12:23.567 --> 12:24.767
This is Stephen.

12:24.867 --> 12:26.433
Yes. Hello.

12:26.533 --> 12:28.300
- I didn't mean it like that.
- Oh.

12:28.400 --> 12:29.967
Well, I don't know,

12:30.067 --> 12:32.767
uh, who you are
or w-what you could ever mean

12:32.867 --> 12:34.733
- by that or anything else.
- Okay.

12:34.833 --> 12:36.267
- So yeah.
- It was good to run into you.

12:36.367 --> 12:37.667
- We'll see you later.
- Very good. Okay.

12:37.767 --> 12:40.267
Hey, I meant your teacher,
not my teacher.

12:40.367 --> 12:42.167
I don't have a teacher.

12:42.267 --> 12:44.067
I'm a grown-up, so I couldn't
have done that, okay?

12:44.167 --> 12:46.733
Yeah, screw you.
And your show sucks.

12:46.833 --> 12:48.500
Come on.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.067
- Do not engage with him.
- What?

12:50.100 --> 12:51.467
(Mrs. Greenfield)
He is off.

12:51.567 --> 12:54.467
(Forrest)
No, he's just a nice young man.

12:54.567 --> 12:59.167
Well, an awkward ending
to a very enjoyable experience.

12:59.267 --> 13:01.200
Stephen, I'm sorry.

13:01.300 --> 13:03.933
It couldn't have been easy
watching me make beautiful

13:04.067 --> 13:06.767
and athletic love
to the woman of your dreams.

13:06.867 --> 13:08.767
But let's agree,
we were both at fault here.

13:08.867 --> 13:11.267
Your question
was confusingly worded.

13:11.367 --> 13:13.967
And I am very happy to announce
that Mrs. Greenfield

13:14.067 --> 13:17.133
has left her oppressive husband
and her dismal life

13:17.233 --> 13:20.067
as your math teacher
to join me here in California,

13:20.167 --> 13:22.733
where we are having
lots more sex.

13:22.833 --> 13:24.933
This has been
a life-changing assignment.

13:25.067 --> 13:28.433
And again, Stephen,
I am sorry.

13:28.533 --> 13:30.367
I give sleeping
with your teacher

13:30.467 --> 13:32.967
five brightly shining stars.

13:33.067 --> 13:35.267
- Highly recommended.
- Oh.

13:35.367 --> 13:38.400
Yay, a new girlfriend
for Forrest.

13:38.500 --> 13:39.933
I really like her.

13:40.067 --> 13:42.100
I think sometimes
the best relationships start out

13:42.200 --> 13:44.367
in the grossest
and most messed up ways.

13:44.467 --> 13:46.567
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

13:50.067 --> 13:53.400
[triumphant music]

13:53.500 --> 13:55.867
May I have
my next review, please?

13:55.967 --> 13:58.067
This one comes
from a William Nilly

13:58.167 --> 13:59.400
in Ellsworth,
Pennsylvania.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.400
- Mm-hmm.
- He writes...

14:09.900 --> 14:11.667
Hmm.

14:11.767 --> 14:14.833
Well, sounds like I'm going to
have to help this gargantuan man

14:14.933 --> 14:18.067
by exploring what it's like
to be a little person.

14:18.167 --> 14:19.367
Oh, actually, Forrest,

14:19.467 --> 14:21.600
they prefer the term
"little people."

14:21.700 --> 14:22.833
They're not just one person.

14:22.933 --> 14:25.100
Yes, well, my apologies.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.400
Okay, here I go.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.167
(A.J.)
Oh, the farther you go,
the smaller you get.

14:30.267 --> 14:31.533
So far so good.

14:31.633 --> 14:33.667
Thank you.

14:33.767 --> 14:36.933
(Forrest)
There is a genuine little person
who works in my office building.

14:37.067 --> 14:41.767
I took in every aspect
of his stature.

14:41.867 --> 14:45.600
- Can I help you?
- No.

14:45.700 --> 14:47.433
(Forrest)
I've never considered
what it would be like

14:47.533 --> 14:49.367
to live in a world
where everything is designed

14:49.467 --> 14:52.300
for people much bigger
than you.

14:55.367 --> 14:58.200
But I was about to find out.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.800
- Hey, Mr. MacNeil.
- Hi.

15:02.900 --> 15:04.067
Your giant ruler arrived.

15:04.167 --> 15:05.767
Oh. Well, no.

15:05.867 --> 15:10.333
Now, Josh, that's a normal-sized
ruler, one foot long.

15:10.433 --> 15:14.067
But it's--it's so big.

15:14.167 --> 15:16.300
No, it's normal-sized.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.067
I'm small.

15:18.100 --> 15:19.533
Oh.

15:19.633 --> 15:21.400
Yes.

15:21.500 --> 15:22.867
(Forrest)
From the beginning,
I found it to be

15:22.967 --> 15:25.633
strangely disorienting.

15:25.733 --> 15:29.067
Even everyday tasks
became more difficult.

15:29.167 --> 15:31.567
Oh, Ah! Ah!

15:31.667 --> 15:34.067
(Forrest)
And the people in my life,
even my loved ones,

15:34.133 --> 15:36.967
discriminated against me
constantly.

15:37.067 --> 15:40.233
Forrest,
what are you doing?

15:40.333 --> 15:42.067
I'm brushing my teeth.

15:42.167 --> 15:44.867
Or am I too small for that?

15:44.967 --> 15:46.400
No.

15:46.500 --> 15:50.467
You're not small at all.

15:50.567 --> 15:52.067
(Forrest)
Though I hated to admit it,

15:52.100 --> 15:53.500
my father was right.

15:53.600 --> 15:56.800
I had not fully committed
to this review.

15:56.900 --> 15:59.200
I was not small at all.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.100
Hey, Mr. MacNeil.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.900
I got your normal-sized
breakfast.

16:08.067 --> 16:10.100
That is not
a normal-sized breakfast.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.100
That's a gigantic breakfast.
Get rid of it, please.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.300
And we're getting rid of
all the other nonsense upstairs.

16:14.400 --> 16:15.600
And come on off those stilts.

16:15.700 --> 16:17.467
It's time to get serious.

16:17.567 --> 16:19.400
Okay, sorry.

16:21.767 --> 16:24.200
You might want
to watch your head there.

16:24.300 --> 16:27.067
(Josh)
It's kind of a bummer, 'cause,
like, I just got used to these.

16:27.133 --> 16:29.633
(Forrest)
Mm-hmm.

16:29.733 --> 16:32.467
I'd found a VHS tape
in my dad's video collection

16:32.567 --> 16:35.167
of a charming little man
named Dorf on Golf.

16:35.267 --> 16:37.333
He is played
by the actor Tim Conway

16:37.433 --> 16:40.200
and bears an amusing resemblance
to Hitler.

16:40.300 --> 16:44.200
A new plan was born.

16:44.300 --> 16:46.200
Passing through the world
of the normals,

16:46.300 --> 16:48.767
I was subjected
to constant discrimination

16:48.867 --> 16:50.467
and blatant rudeness.

16:50.567 --> 16:53.067
[scoffs]

16:53.133 --> 16:54.533
Hey, hey.

16:54.633 --> 16:56.067
I'm crossing here.

16:56.100 --> 16:57.933
[horn honks]
- Move it, jerk-off.

16:58.067 --> 16:59.633
- What's the matter?
- Get out of the road.

16:59.733 --> 17:01.367
It takes the time it takes
to walk across the street.

17:01.467 --> 17:03.333
[horn honks]

17:03.433 --> 17:05.200
(Forrest)
Sadly, I found even those
from my own community

17:05.300 --> 17:08.333
didn't accept me,
so deep was their self-loathing.

17:08.433 --> 17:10.900
Can I help you?

17:11.067 --> 17:13.067
No.

17:15.767 --> 17:18.067
(Forrest)
But perhaps
the greatest adversity I faced

17:18.167 --> 17:21.967
was the overzealous desire
of everybody to help me.

17:24.933 --> 17:26.867
There you go.

17:28.933 --> 17:30.100
What are you after,
the remote? Here.

17:30.200 --> 17:31.967
Yeah. No, I got it.
No, I got it.

17:32.067 --> 17:34.167
Dad. [sighs]
I had it.

17:34.267 --> 17:36.633
(Forrest)
Despite their good intentions,
the people in my life

17:36.733 --> 17:39.667
seemed to assume I was helpless
to make it on my own

17:39.767 --> 17:44.267
in this normal-sized world.

17:44.367 --> 17:45.400
Should I just--

17:45.500 --> 17:47.333
I can do it myself.

17:47.433 --> 17:48.600
Okay, sorry.

17:48.700 --> 17:50.067
(Forrest)
Even Mrs. Greenfield,

17:50.100 --> 17:52.300
whose loving support
had done so much

17:52.400 --> 17:54.333
to help me move on
from my ex-wife,

17:54.433 --> 17:58.767
had no faith in my ability
to do the most basic activities.

17:58.867 --> 18:00.867
I'll just give you
this one boost.

18:00.967 --> 18:03.333
Would you give a normal-sized
person a boost into bed?

18:03.433 --> 18:06.367
(Forrest)
To really discover the
experience of a little person,

18:06.467 --> 18:09.833
I would have
to contend for myself.

18:09.933 --> 18:11.467
All right, you two, get going.

18:11.567 --> 18:13.067
- All right, but I--
- Gosh.

18:13.133 --> 18:16.500
I'll see you
in a couple of hours, okay?

18:19.867 --> 18:21.133
I've sent my dad

18:21.233 --> 18:23.100
and Mrs. Greenfield out
for a couple of hours

18:23.200 --> 18:26.200
so that I can prepare
a surprise meal made by me,

18:26.300 --> 18:28.700
here in
this regular-sized kitchen.

18:28.800 --> 18:31.867
Now, Mrs. Greenfield
has let it slip

18:31.967 --> 18:34.800
that her favorite vegetable
is Brussels sprouts.

18:34.900 --> 18:37.767
But has she ever had them
with my signature paprika?

18:37.867 --> 18:39.500
I don't think so.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.333
I know I took out the paprika.

18:41.433 --> 18:42.367
Oh, there it is.

18:42.467 --> 18:45.167
All righty.
Very good.

18:45.267 --> 18:46.433
Oh, what is that?

18:46.533 --> 18:47.933
Oh, [bleep].

18:48.067 --> 18:50.433
Oh, wow. Oh, no.
Oh, [bleep].

18:50.533 --> 18:52.067
Okay, all right,
all right, all right.

18:52.100 --> 18:54.133
Here we go.

18:54.233 --> 18:56.167
Oh, [bleep].
Oh.

18:56.267 --> 18:58.167
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.

18:58.267 --> 18:59.333
Oh, [bleep].

18:59.433 --> 19:02.067
Oh, [bleep].
Oh, [bleep].

19:02.133 --> 19:04.367
(Forrest)
Under the usual circumstances
of my life,

19:04.467 --> 19:07.067
I could easily have grabbed
this fire extinguisher

19:07.133 --> 19:10.200
and put out the blaze that was
rapidly engulfing the kitchen.

19:10.300 --> 19:11.600
[bleep].
Oh, [bleep], [bleep].

19:11.700 --> 19:13.767
(Forrest)
But now I was a little person,

19:13.867 --> 19:16.900
a simple truth that outweighed
any other considerations,

19:17.067 --> 19:19.933
be it my personal safety
or my father's house.

19:20.067 --> 19:21.767
Oh, I got to get out of here!
[fire alarm blaring]

19:21.867 --> 19:23.167
I got to get out of here!

19:23.267 --> 19:25.767
Oh, [bleep].
[screaming]

19:25.867 --> 19:27.867
I got to get out of here!

19:27.967 --> 19:30.567
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

19:30.667 --> 19:33.700
Aw, [bleep].

19:33.800 --> 19:35.100
Oh, God.

19:35.200 --> 19:38.133
[grunting]

19:39.700 --> 19:43.100
Oh, [bleep].
Oh.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.433
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

19:45.533 --> 19:48.433
[crying]

19:48.533 --> 19:52.467
Where is
the goddamn fire department?

19:52.567 --> 19:55.167
[bleep].

19:55.267 --> 19:59.400
In what must be a common
experience for little people,

19:59.500 --> 20:02.400
a fire extinguisher
was thoughtlessly placed

20:02.500 --> 20:07.100
at a regular person's height
off the ground.

20:07.200 --> 20:10.467
As a little person, that didn't
do me any good at all.

20:10.567 --> 20:12.800
- No! No!
- God.

20:12.900 --> 20:15.667
- Forrest.
- No, no, no, no, no!

20:15.767 --> 20:16.667
- Oh, God.
- What have you done?

20:16.767 --> 20:17.800
Come on, move, move.

20:17.900 --> 20:19.833
I am moving
as fast as I can.

20:19.933 --> 20:21.300
No, could you just stand up
for a second?

20:21.400 --> 20:22.933
- Don't tell me to stand up!
- Come on!

20:23.033 --> 20:24.567
- I am standing up.
- The house is on fire!

20:24.667 --> 20:27.467
That is the cruelest thing
you can say to a little person.

20:27.567 --> 20:29.667
Dad, why was
the fire extinguisher

20:29.767 --> 20:31.667
so high off the ground?

20:31.767 --> 20:34.567
- Stand up!
[siren wails]

20:34.667 --> 20:36.367
Everything is in there.

20:41.833 --> 20:43.233
Being a little person

20:43.333 --> 20:45.500
gave me a tremendous sense
of accomplishment

20:45.600 --> 20:49.533
as I contended with the world
up here from down there.

20:49.633 --> 20:50.967
But a tremendous sense
of accomplishment

20:51.067 --> 20:53.033
does not put out fires,

20:53.133 --> 20:55.667
as my father
so painfully found out.

20:55.767 --> 20:59.333
Being a little person,
3 1/2 stars.

21:02.833 --> 21:05.067
Well, that's all the time
we have for Review tonight.

21:05.167 --> 21:07.500
Please be sure
and join us next time.

21:15.767 --> 21:17.400
By the way,
how are you coming on finding me

21:17.500 --> 21:19.100
a normal-sized bowl to go
with my normal-sized spoon

21:19.200 --> 21:21.100
so that I can have
a normal amount of soup?

21:21.200 --> 21:24.067
So you mean, like--
like, a really big bowl, right?

21:24.100 --> 21:26.500
Just do your best, okay?
