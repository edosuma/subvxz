00:42.129 --> 00:43.304
Care for some ham?

00:43.347 --> 00:44.783
No ham for me.

00:44.827 --> 00:46.742

00:47.830 --> 00:49.353
Beautiful wreath,

00:49.397 --> 00:51.703

No. Jessica Town

02:14.917 --> 02:17.528
You guys should have tasted my
pancakes with turkey gravy.

02:17.572 --> 02:20.096
Why would --
He's a human sewer.

02:21.619 --> 02:24.405
Ooh. Our community parkis building an ice rinkfor the holidays.

02:24.448 --> 02:27.364
Ice skating in Florida --what an era.

02:27.408 --> 02:28.539
We should go together.

02:28.583 --> 02:30.411
We haven't gonesince the boys were born.

02:30.454 --> 02:32.674
Louis, it's 1999.

02:32.717 --> 02:35.198
It's the last Christmas
of the century --

02:35.242 --> 02:37.113
no, the millennium.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.202
It has to be perfect.

02:39.246 --> 02:42.640
I'm marking the occasion
with a stunning monument --

02:42.684 --> 02:45.252
a life-size gingerbread
house on our lawn.

02:45.295 --> 02:47.036
Take a look
at my prototype.

02:48.385 --> 02:51.606
Behold the flawless
candy-cane gutters.

02:52.955 --> 02:54.565
Although, they'll be a bitch
to clean once the leaves fall.

02:54.609 --> 02:57.568
Jessica, instead of addingto your list of holiday tasks,

02:57.612 --> 02:59.048
you should be
subtracting.

02:59.091 --> 03:01.224
We lose you forthe whole month of December.

03:01.268 --> 03:03.444
Well, people expect a lot
from me at Christmas.

03:03.487 --> 03:05.576
My cards,
my caroling solos,

03:05.620 --> 03:07.883
the boys with their unique
Christmas requests.

03:07.926 --> 03:10.451
Hey, boys, what do you wantfor Christmas this year?

03:10.494 --> 03:11.452
Together: Gift card.

03:11.495 --> 03:12.453
See?

03:12.496 --> 03:14.063
It gets simpler nowthat they're getting older.

03:14.106 --> 03:15.673
Let's go skating.

03:15.717 --> 03:17.066
What if I get hurt
on the ice?

03:17.109 --> 03:19.634
What if somebody slams into me,
breaking my bones?

03:19.677 --> 03:21.462
Come on. Your skeleton?Strong.

03:21.505 --> 03:23.246
Can't risk it.
Who would do all my work?

03:23.290 --> 03:25.379
The holiday perfection
I've become famous for

03:25.422 --> 03:26.380
would be ruined.

03:26.423 --> 03:27.729
Oh, I got to run.

03:27.772 --> 03:29.121
Tinsel goes
on sale today,

03:29.165 --> 03:32.212
and I refuse to buy any
that's already been touched.

03:33.387 --> 03:36.868
Oh, no.Look at that huge bear.

03:36.912 --> 03:39.131
Quick!
Drop the salmon and --

03:39.175 --> 03:40.481
Ugh.
Read me in again.

03:40.524 --> 03:41.525
Ugh.

03:41.569 --> 03:42.874
Evan, go from your line
about the river.

03:42.918 --> 03:45.877
Stop whining.
Emery needs our help.

03:45.921 --> 03:47.096
Thanks, Grandma.

03:47.139 --> 03:48.315
Let's go findsomewhere else to rehearse.

03:48.358 --> 03:52.101
It should always be
about the family.

03:52.144 --> 03:55.496
Just like in this play,
"Wyoming Family."

03:58.412 --> 04:00.414
Way to tank those linesso we could get out of this.

04:00.457 --> 04:01.850
Smart.

04:01.893 --> 04:03.721
Going through the motions.
That's my thing.

04:03.765 --> 04:05.636
Hey, guys.

04:05.680 --> 04:08.509
Do you mind hiding
my Christmas gift for Marvin?

04:08.552 --> 04:10.554
All he does
is snoop for presents,

04:10.598 --> 04:11.729
and I'd feel better
if I kept it here.

04:11.773 --> 04:14.950
Sure, Honey.
What'd you get him?

04:14.993 --> 04:19.389
It's...a maritime
nutcracker.

04:19.433 --> 04:21.870
It combines
his three favorite things --

04:21.913 --> 04:23.350
snacks, the Navy,
and wood.

04:23.393 --> 04:24.960
I'll be back later
to wrap it.

04:25.003 --> 04:26.527
Thank you.

04:26.570 --> 04:28.355
There's no way
this dude can crack a nut.

04:28.398 --> 04:31.358
You'd be surprised by the amountof force a lever can generate.

04:31.401 --> 04:32.402
It's physics.

04:32.446 --> 04:33.751
Nerd, please.

04:33.795 --> 04:35.579
Are you doubting me?

04:35.623 --> 04:37.189
Take this pistachio.

04:39.366 --> 04:41.803
See? Formidable --like Mom's skeleton.

04:41.846 --> 04:44.936
Now, let's add a lever
to the equation.

04:47.635 --> 04:49.463
Awesome.

04:49.506 --> 04:50.725
Levers.

04:50.768 --> 04:52.379
Let's go bigger.

04:52.422 --> 04:55.164
Now you're talking.There's no stoppin' us now.

04:56.818 --> 04:58.123
We pushed him too far.

04:58.167 --> 04:59.386
It was the jawbreaker.

04:59.429 --> 05:01.213
It says itright in the damn name.

05:01.257 --> 05:02.606
Relax, bro.

05:02.650 --> 05:03.912
We'll replace it
before Honey finds out.

05:03.955 --> 05:05.000
How much could it cost?

05:06.654 --> 05:09.221
"Handmade in Germanyby real Germans."

05:09.265 --> 05:11.398
It's $400!

05:11.441 --> 05:13.791
Why does Germany always
have to go over the top?

05:16.533 --> 05:18.622
Are those
my Christmas cards?

05:18.666 --> 05:19.928
Emery:
Dad did them for you.

05:19.971 --> 05:22.147
He seemed happy to use
the rest of his tuba stamps.

05:22.191 --> 05:24.846
Went on a big rant about postagegoing up again next year.

05:24.889 --> 05:27.501
Tubas don'trepresent Christmas.

05:28.545 --> 05:31.243
And he scribbled
the addresses.

05:31.287 --> 05:33.550
Where's the elegant
calligraphy?

05:33.594 --> 05:36.597
Stupid tuba hippo.

05:42.559 --> 05:45.954
What in the name of Lao Ban?

05:45.997 --> 05:48.043
Hey!
What are you guys going?

05:48.086 --> 05:50.219
We decided
to change things up.

05:50.262 --> 05:52.830
Yeah. The butcher
gave us the idea.Mm-hmm.

05:54.005 --> 05:56.399
How about this sassy brass?

06:01.361 --> 06:02.884
I'm out of cash.

06:02.927 --> 06:05.452
I spent it on Tina's gift --a brown weave belt.

06:05.495 --> 06:07.584
The whole thing
is belt holes.

06:07.628 --> 06:08.759
How 'bout you?

06:08.803 --> 06:10.065
I've got nothing.

06:10.108 --> 06:12.197
All my extra money
is tied up in mutual funds.

06:12.241 --> 06:14.548
We don't have
anywhere close to $400

06:14.591 --> 06:15.462
to buy a new nutcracker.

06:15.505 --> 06:17.333
We have to tell Honey
what happened.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.901
And risk getting in trouble andlosing our Christmas gift cards?

06:19.944 --> 06:21.903
I'm spending mineon a certificate to Taco Bell

06:21.946 --> 06:24.340
so I can crush tacos
whenever I want.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.430
Wait, you're using a gift card
to buy a gift card?

06:27.474 --> 06:28.692
You've got to spend moneyto make money.

06:28.736 --> 06:30.215
We're not telling Honey.

06:30.259 --> 06:31.216
We'll just do
what I always do

06:31.260 --> 06:33.088
when I make a mistake --cover it up.

06:33.131 --> 06:36.091
I don't know.
Sounds delinquent.

06:36.134 --> 06:39.355
Sure. My way sometimes getsmessy, but it always works out.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.313
I've broken plenty of thingsand never gotten caught.

06:41.357 --> 06:43.315
You think that'syour original watch?

06:44.273 --> 06:47.058
That watch was a birthday gift
from my pen pal in Ecuador.

06:47.102 --> 06:48.538
Well, this one's
from Sears.

06:48.582 --> 06:50.888
I don't know.
Seems wrong.

06:50.932 --> 06:53.804
Evan, think aboutall the stress confessingwould cause everyone.

06:53.848 --> 06:56.894
Honey? Mom?

06:56.938 --> 06:58.679
You want to
ruin Christmas?

06:58.722 --> 07:00.637
Okay.

07:00.681 --> 07:01.943
Let's do it your way.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.860
Also, what happened
to my old watch?

07:05.903 --> 07:08.079
Long story short,it's in Trent's dog.

07:10.386 --> 07:11.474
Oh, hey.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.911
You see how I, uh, knocked out
all the Christmas cards?

07:13.955 --> 07:15.565
I sure did.

07:15.609 --> 07:17.611
Great. Then let's lace upsome steel and hit the rink.

07:17.654 --> 07:18.612
I packed some singles,

07:18.655 --> 07:21.049
so maybe we can tip our wayinto a Zamboni ride.

07:21.092 --> 07:22.354
No Zamboni.

07:22.398 --> 07:25.967
I have to stay and fix
everything you did wrong.

07:28.752 --> 07:30.058
I seal each one
with a kiss.

07:30.101 --> 07:31.886
Nobody knows,
but I know.

07:31.929 --> 07:33.931
Okay.

07:33.975 --> 07:35.367
I think you're
going overboard.

07:35.411 --> 07:37.674
I think you should leave
Christmas to the professionals.

07:37.718 --> 07:39.110
You thought I had
little time before?

07:39.154 --> 07:40.547
Now I have
no time at all.

07:40.590 --> 07:42.853
I mean, look at
this calligraphy.

07:42.897 --> 07:45.290
It could have come
straight from the Vatican.

07:50.252 --> 07:53.168
You're redoing theenvelopes just becauseI used the wrong stamps?

07:53.211 --> 07:55.300
I don't see what
the big deal is.

07:55.344 --> 07:57.738
My Christmas cards
kick off the holiday season,

07:57.781 --> 08:00.175
and everyone expects
perfection from me.

08:00.218 --> 08:03.221
Okay, I knew you wereparticular about Christmas --

08:03.265 --> 08:04.527
Particular?

08:04.571 --> 08:06.703
I've been fine-tuning
the details for years.

08:06.747 --> 08:08.444
I don't improvise.

08:08.488 --> 08:12.317
This is Christmas,
not some sleazy jazz concert.

08:12.361 --> 08:13.318
Understood.
I just didn't know

08:13.362 --> 08:15.016
it went all the way downto envelopes.

08:15.059 --> 08:16.321
But now that I know,I can help out,

08:16.365 --> 08:17.584
and then we can go skating.

08:17.627 --> 08:19.542
I don't think
that's a good idea.

08:19.586 --> 08:21.544
Let's see -- stockings needhanging, wine needs mulling.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.764
Come on.How hard could it really be?

08:23.807 --> 08:24.765
Okay.
You want to help?

08:24.808 --> 08:26.680
You just drew
gingerbread house.

08:28.246 --> 08:29.770
What? But that's
your showstopper.

08:29.813 --> 08:31.423
Well, you said
all this was easy, right?

08:31.467 --> 08:33.556
The grand unveiling is set
for the end of the week.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.036
It's B-Y-O-E-N.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.126
Bring your own eggnog.

08:38.169 --> 08:39.736
Oh.

08:41.521 --> 08:42.739
You want me to work at the mall
as a Christmas elf?

08:42.783 --> 08:44.132
Eddie: Yep.

08:44.175 --> 08:45.916
All you got to do
is fill out that application.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.222
Under
emergency contact,

08:47.265 --> 08:49.354
put Cindy Crawford.
See what happens.

08:49.398 --> 08:51.443
Why would I ever
want to do this?

08:52.836 --> 08:55.709
Well, for starters,
it'll help your acting career.

08:55.752 --> 08:58.407
Think of all the great
character work that you'd do.

08:58.450 --> 09:00.714
I heard that "The Mummy's"
very own Brendan Fraser

09:00.757 --> 09:02.193
got his start as a mall elf.

09:02.237 --> 09:03.804
You'll also get
a 30% mall discount

09:03.847 --> 09:04.718
that we can all share.

09:04.761 --> 09:06.502
Think about it.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.069
Just like that,
a $400 Christmas gift

09:08.112 --> 09:09.723
becomes $280.

09:09.766 --> 09:12.160
You broke Honey's nutcracker,
didn't you?

09:12.203 --> 09:13.770
It was his quick math,wasn't it?

09:13.814 --> 09:15.076
Fine.
We broke it.

09:15.119 --> 09:16.730
But even with my job
at Cattleman's,

09:16.773 --> 09:18.949
we still can't afford
to buy a new one.

09:18.993 --> 09:20.647
And I don't meet the age

09:20.690 --> 09:21.865
and height requirementsfor elf duty,

09:21.909 --> 09:24.607
which feels backwards,but hey, rules are rules.

09:24.651 --> 09:27.523
Sorry, guys,
but this isn't my fight.

09:27.567 --> 09:28.524
Wait.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.525
What about
what Grandma said

09:29.569 --> 09:30.744
about doing things
for the family?

09:30.787 --> 09:32.963
Come on, Emery.
Your brothers are down.

09:33.007 --> 09:34.704
It's Christmas.
Help us out.

09:34.748 --> 09:35.662
For the family.

09:35.705 --> 09:38.316
Okay.
For the family.

09:38.360 --> 09:39.317
My man!

09:39.361 --> 09:40.754
Hey,
while you're there,

09:40.797 --> 09:42.494
do you mind putting in
a good word for me with Santa?

09:42.538 --> 09:44.322
It's been a real
up-and-down year for me.

09:45.672 --> 09:47.499
How's it coming?

09:47.543 --> 09:49.501
Awfully messy.

09:49.545 --> 09:50.807
Well, it's this
damn frosting.

09:50.851 --> 09:53.549
It's basically concrete --
solidifies instantly.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.856
Doesn't bode wellfor the real thing.

09:55.899 --> 09:56.900
Maybe I should take over.

09:56.944 --> 09:58.119
Nope. I've got it.

09:58.162 --> 10:00.251
Um, quick question --
I ate a lot of this.

10:00.295 --> 10:01.557
How worried should I be?

10:05.779 --> 10:06.823
Thank you all for coming.

10:06.867 --> 10:09.521
It is good to show interest
in your local government,

10:09.565 --> 10:11.088
even though this isn't
a democracy.

10:11.132 --> 10:13.525
The butcher's influenceis spreading,

10:13.569 --> 10:16.224
first with the tuba musicand then with the ugly signs.

10:16.267 --> 10:17.878
Yeah, and then you reward him
with a contract

10:17.921 --> 10:19.706
to build
our new library?

10:19.749 --> 10:20.794
Yes, our beautiful new library

10:20.837 --> 10:22.056
that will be filled
with only one book --

10:22.099 --> 10:23.274
my novel -- yes.

10:23.318 --> 10:25.276
Oh! This is too much
for a meat vendor!

10:25.320 --> 10:28.540
Exactly. Once that simple
butcher sees how hard it is,

10:28.584 --> 10:30.847
he'll quit,
and then I, your mayor,

10:30.891 --> 10:32.544
will come in and save the day.

10:32.588 --> 10:34.808
But what if
he pulls it off?

10:34.851 --> 10:36.723
Please.
That would take a miracle.

10:36.766 --> 10:38.812
We live in a town where
it's Christmas year-round.

10:38.855 --> 10:40.814
Miracles happen
all the time.

10:44.556 --> 10:46.384
Big shift
at Cattleman's today.

10:46.428 --> 10:47.908
Sold a guy some ribs...Evan: Mm.

10:47.951 --> 10:49.300
...and my socks.
Ugh.

10:49.344 --> 10:50.737
What?
You know what?

10:50.780 --> 10:51.825
We need money.
I don't want to know.

10:52.869 --> 10:54.566
Eddie: There he is.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.699
How was your first dayat work, champ?

10:56.743 --> 10:57.831
It was awful.

10:57.874 --> 10:59.920
Elfing's the worst.

10:59.963 --> 11:01.704
Awful, like,
in a good way?

11:01.748 --> 11:04.272
There was an endless line
of people, parents shoving,

11:04.315 --> 11:05.316
babies crying.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.405
And Santa's no picnic,
either.

11:07.449 --> 11:09.756
"Hey, elf!
I said skimmilk."

11:09.799 --> 11:11.801
Emery,this sounds terrible.

11:11.845 --> 11:13.411
Emery?
Who's Emery?

11:13.455 --> 11:15.631
My name's Jingles now.

11:15.675 --> 11:16.937
I'm gonna go to bed.

11:16.980 --> 11:18.721
I hate myself.

11:19.983 --> 11:22.769
We can't let him
go back there.

11:22.812 --> 11:24.945
Hey, this is what yousigned up for, remember?

11:24.988 --> 11:27.948
You knew my way could get messy,but it works.

11:27.991 --> 11:32.735
If Santa's drinking skim,what chance do any of us have?

11:34.041 --> 11:36.391
So, we got to make this,
but life-size?

11:36.434 --> 11:38.523
She's got a rain shower
in the half-bath.

11:38.567 --> 11:39.786
You don't make anything easy,
do you, boss?

11:39.829 --> 11:41.918
I give you three daysof vacation a year.

11:41.962 --> 11:43.093
That's pretty easy.

11:43.137 --> 11:45.922
And I'm easy on the eyes.That's two easys.

11:45.966 --> 11:47.097
How come you
stopped screaming

11:47.141 --> 11:48.795
and banging your head
against the walls?

11:48.838 --> 11:49.970
Is everything okay?

11:50.013 --> 11:51.928
Everything's great.Some might say easy.

11:51.972 --> 11:53.321
Whoa.
That's three.

11:53.364 --> 11:54.844
What's that smell?

11:54.888 --> 11:56.324
We got some fresh gingerbreadcooking in the oven --

11:56.367 --> 11:57.586
homemade recipe.

11:57.629 --> 11:59.240
Trent's gonna help me startthrowing up some walls.

11:59.283 --> 12:02.634
Oh, my God.
It's a Christmas miracle.

12:02.678 --> 12:04.245
I told you. It's not that hard.Anyone could do it.

12:04.288 --> 12:05.681
Really?

12:05.725 --> 12:08.553
So, then you'd be okay if
I moved the unveiling up to,

12:08.597 --> 12:09.685
say, tomorrow?

12:09.729 --> 12:11.774
Give the neighborhood
a few extra days

12:11.818 --> 12:13.210
to enjoy your handiwork.

12:13.254 --> 12:14.908
Uh, tomorrow?

12:14.951 --> 12:16.910
That's, like,
one day from now.

12:16.953 --> 12:17.824
Oh, unless you
can't handle it?

12:19.042 --> 12:20.043
Nope. We've got it.

12:20.087 --> 12:22.002
If we can handle CatfishWednesdays at Cattleman's,

12:22.045 --> 12:23.438
we could handle anything.

12:23.481 --> 12:24.656
I'm sure you can.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.963
I can't wait to see
how your homemade recipe

12:27.007 --> 12:31.272
accounts for Florida's
relentless swamp humidity.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.884
I'll be honest, boss --
no way this gingerbread house

12:34.928 --> 12:36.059
can be built by tomorrow.

12:36.103 --> 12:38.714
And I say that as a ginger
myself -- one who eats bread.

12:41.891 --> 12:44.067
Alright, bro.
You loose?

12:44.111 --> 12:45.155
Need another Tic Tac?

12:45.199 --> 12:46.853
I can't go back
out there.

12:48.245 --> 12:50.073
It's almost over.

12:50.117 --> 12:51.466
I'm picking up another shiftat Cattleman's,

12:51.509 --> 12:54.034
and Evan's closing a dealright now as we speak.

12:54.077 --> 12:55.862
We're all in this
together.

12:55.905 --> 12:56.906
For the family.

12:56.950 --> 12:58.255
For the family.

12:58.299 --> 13:00.867
Now go out there and throwsome kids in that old man's lap.

13:03.347 --> 13:06.046
Hello, good sir.
Nice location.

13:06.089 --> 13:08.918
Donations for the Toys for Totsbin are right over there.

13:10.702 --> 13:13.444
No, I'm actually here to trade
for one of your nutcrackers.

13:13.488 --> 13:14.968
Sorry, kid.
Cash only.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.063
Hey, Evan!
What are you doing here?

13:23.106 --> 13:25.108
I'm allowed to be here!What are you doing here?!

13:25.152 --> 13:27.763
Uh -- Wh-- Marvin foundthe stocking stuffers I got him,

13:27.807 --> 13:29.983
so I just had to come get
some aftershave.

13:30.026 --> 13:31.985
Thank God you guys
are hiding his main gift.

13:32.028 --> 13:35.075
You are gonna make
his Christmas morning.

13:35.118 --> 13:36.337
You knowthe Huang brothers --

13:36.380 --> 13:38.992
always dependable,
rock steady.

13:39.035 --> 13:40.645
Oh, well, someone
should tell Emery that,

13:40.689 --> 13:42.473
because that kid
is in pieces.

13:44.954 --> 13:47.087
I just saw him wiping his tears
with a paper snowflake.

13:47.130 --> 13:50.090
Anyway, I will come by later
to wrap that gift.

14:06.193 --> 14:09.109
How'd it go with
the Beanie Babies?

14:09.152 --> 14:10.240
Fine.
It went fine.

14:10.284 --> 14:12.286
Emery doesn't have to workas an elf anymore.

14:12.329 --> 14:14.244
Really?
That's great news!

14:14.288 --> 14:15.550
So, how much did you
get for them?

14:15.593 --> 14:17.552
Is this a "pizza's on Evan"
situation?

14:19.206 --> 14:20.468
I stole
the nutcracker!

14:20.511 --> 14:21.861
Aah!
I'm too pretty for jail!

14:27.083 --> 14:29.520
This is one
high-class garland.

14:29.564 --> 14:33.002
Gar-land is where
Garfield is from.

14:33.046 --> 14:34.525
Louis: Jessica! Hurry!
I need you!

14:34.569 --> 14:37.833
I knew he didn't
have it in him.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.140
Wow.

14:40.183 --> 14:43.012
It's worse
than I thought.

14:43.056 --> 14:44.057
It's perfect.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.623
Perfect?

14:45.667 --> 14:47.974
This looks like a place wheregingerbread men go to O.D.

14:48.017 --> 14:50.280
No way.

14:50.324 --> 14:53.980
No, it represents the humble
spirit of Christmas --

14:54.023 --> 14:57.026
before everything became
so over-the-top.

14:57.070 --> 14:58.941
Well, as tempting as it looks,
don't take a bite.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.551
It's all nails.

15:00.595 --> 15:02.075
Everyone loves
Louis' idea.

15:02.118 --> 15:03.424
Scaling back.

15:03.467 --> 15:05.861
Simple.
Genius.

15:08.342 --> 15:10.170
Honey:
I'm loving this music!

15:10.213 --> 15:11.736
And I'm loving
this clapping!

15:13.086 --> 15:14.957
Constable Bryson,

15:15.001 --> 15:17.351
arrest those two
for disorderly conduct.

15:17.394 --> 15:18.961
Sorry, ma'am, but you no longer

15:19.005 --> 15:20.658
have that kind of authority.

15:20.702 --> 15:22.747
You're not
the mayor anymore.

15:22.791 --> 15:24.880
What? Well, if I'm not,
then who is?

15:27.143 --> 15:28.623
I give you...

15:28.666 --> 15:30.407
your new library.

15:30.451 --> 15:33.062
What about all the money that'ssupposed to make it look nice?

15:33.106 --> 15:34.890
I used it to build
an ice rink.

15:36.674 --> 15:38.459
Yes!

15:42.202 --> 15:44.378
I'll admit, the time crunchhad me nervous.

15:44.421 --> 15:45.857
Couldn't get to all the bellsand whistles,

15:45.901 --> 15:48.077
but people love it.

15:48.121 --> 15:50.471
Thanks, Louis.
You ruined my Christmas.

15:52.168 --> 15:55.084
Hey, you really should
get onto to this nog, Lou.

15:55.128 --> 15:57.260
It's only 2,000 calories
a glass.

16:06.443 --> 16:09.446
Um...what are you doing
to my sit-down hairdryer?

16:09.490 --> 16:12.928
Making a joke out of somethingyou love, like you did to me.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.278
Jessica, I thought you'd behappy with my gingerbread house.

16:15.322 --> 16:16.932
Please.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.412
You built a shack.

16:18.455 --> 16:21.197
Look, I know it's not
Princess Jasmine's
Arabian fortress,

16:21.241 --> 16:22.851
but everyone loves it.

16:22.894 --> 16:24.722
Isn't that all
that matters?

16:24.766 --> 16:26.072
Christmas is my holiday.

16:26.115 --> 16:27.856
It has to be perfect.

16:27.899 --> 16:31.642
Not quickly pushed through,not scaled back -- perfect.

16:31.686 --> 16:33.905
Well, you know what a perfect
Christmas is to me?

16:33.949 --> 16:35.124
Spending time with you.

16:36.691 --> 16:38.171
The chair
looks beautiful.

16:43.306 --> 16:44.960
What came over you, man?

16:45.004 --> 16:47.136
I've never stolenanything in my life --

16:47.180 --> 16:50.052
I mean, a few hearts, sure,but never a piece of property.

16:50.096 --> 16:51.271
Shh!
Lower your voice.

16:52.315 --> 16:53.316
She's watching
"Die Hard."

16:53.360 --> 16:54.883
If Bruce Willis is on TV,

16:54.926 --> 16:56.624
the rest of the worldfades away.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.843
Yippee-ki-ay!

16:58.887 --> 16:59.931
I don't know what happened
back there.

16:59.975 --> 17:02.543
I saw the nutcracker.
Honey showed up.

17:02.586 --> 17:03.761
Emery was crying.

17:03.805 --> 17:05.633
Next thing you know,
I'm outside the mall.

17:05.676 --> 17:07.200
It's like I blacked out.

17:07.243 --> 17:08.418
This is really hard-core.

17:08.462 --> 17:10.638
Now we're sitting ona hot nutcracker.

17:10.681 --> 17:11.682
I'm gonna have to go
on the run.

17:11.726 --> 17:12.857
Start a new life.

17:12.901 --> 17:14.772
This is all my fault.

17:14.816 --> 17:16.905
I was the one who pushed youto do things my way.

17:16.948 --> 17:18.950
You never told me
to steal, Eddie.

17:18.994 --> 17:20.909
We should have just told Honey,like you said.

17:20.952 --> 17:22.258
Well,
it's too late now.

17:22.302 --> 17:23.651
I'll have to wear
a fake mustache

17:23.694 --> 17:25.131
until I can grow one
on my own.

17:25.174 --> 17:26.306
Let's just...

17:26.349 --> 17:28.134
return the nutcrackerand come clean to Honey.

17:28.177 --> 17:30.223
We're gonna be in
so much trouble.
No.

17:30.266 --> 17:32.007
I'm taking all the blame.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.356
What about
the consequences?

17:33.400 --> 17:34.662
Your Christmas gift card?

17:34.705 --> 17:36.011
Yeah, I know.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.448
I'm really hoping this scoresme some points with Santa.

17:38.492 --> 17:40.581
Or Jesus.Whoever's listening.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.670
Now, come on.Let's go call Honey.

17:42.713 --> 17:47.805
Hans Gruber is actually
the hero of this story.

17:47.849 --> 17:51.026
This must be what
King Kong feels like.

18:00.731 --> 18:02.472
You do this all day?

18:02.516 --> 18:04.996
Put on cheap makeup
and pick up trash?

18:05.040 --> 18:07.825
Um, I did find an
almost-untouched BLT once,

18:07.869 --> 18:09.262
so it's not always
terrible.

18:09.305 --> 18:10.611
Oh.

18:10.654 --> 18:13.353
Look at all those couples
spending time together.

18:13.396 --> 18:16.051
I mean, that's what Christmas
is all about.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.314
Shame we can't join them.

18:18.358 --> 18:20.273
We're too busy
working around the clock,

18:20.316 --> 18:22.188
picking up trash
so the town looks perfect.

18:26.757 --> 18:29.151
How'd it go with Operation
Stolen Nutcracker Return?

18:29.195 --> 18:32.154
Success. I told the vendor I wascleaning it in Santa's workshop.

18:32.198 --> 18:34.287
Everyone trusts a kidwearing bells.

18:34.330 --> 18:35.549
Ha!

18:35.592 --> 18:37.812
Isn't this wrapping paper
perfect?

18:37.855 --> 18:40.423
Navy blue?

18:40.467 --> 18:43.209
Because the nutcracker's
clearly a naval officer.

18:44.688 --> 18:46.995
Eh, you know what?
Marvin will appreciate it.

18:47.038 --> 18:48.823
Yeah.
About that gift...

18:48.866 --> 18:51.608
We --Good-looking jaws
on this one.

18:51.652 --> 18:53.001
Cherish him.

18:53.044 --> 18:54.394
Ohh!

18:54.437 --> 18:57.788
Thank you
for keeping it safe, guys.

18:59.399 --> 19:02.445
I don't know how you resisted
the urge to play with this guy.

19:02.489 --> 19:05.013
You have more willpower
than me.

19:05.056 --> 19:06.841
Whoa, G-ma.

19:06.884 --> 19:08.799
Why'd you bail us out?

19:08.843 --> 19:13.587
I overheard you were in trouble,so I did it for the family.

19:13.630 --> 19:16.024
All: For the family.

19:22.900 --> 19:25.338
Nice chimney.
Peppermint bark?

19:25.381 --> 19:27.992
It was a milk crate
from the shed.

19:28.036 --> 19:30.473
I didn't mean to crap so hardon your gingerbread house.

19:30.517 --> 19:33.476
I was just worried thatChristmas would be ruined

19:33.520 --> 19:34.477
if I didn't
make it perfect.

19:34.521 --> 19:36.436
It's what I'm known for.

19:36.479 --> 19:37.611
Christmas isn't about
being perfect.

19:37.654 --> 19:39.482
It's about being together.

19:39.526 --> 19:40.483
We just want
to spend it with you,

19:40.527 --> 19:42.006
no matter how...

19:42.050 --> 19:43.443
crappy it looks.

19:43.486 --> 19:44.618
So, you see it, too?

19:46.663 --> 19:51.059
I know you were just trying tohelp when you wrote those cards.

19:51.102 --> 19:53.583
Want to skate circlesaround some teenagers?

19:53.627 --> 19:55.368
Disrupt their make-outs?

19:55.411 --> 19:58.153
Really? I thought you were
worried about getting hurt.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.721
Fun fact -- I'm goodat everything I do.

20:00.764 --> 20:03.245
Besides, what is thereleft to do?

20:03.289 --> 20:05.465
You built the
gingerbread house,

20:05.508 --> 20:07.945
and I see why
everybody loves it.

20:07.989 --> 20:09.033
Well, don't look
too close.

20:09.077 --> 20:10.861
I cut a few corners
during construction.

20:10.905 --> 20:13.168
There's a rat in here!

20:13.212 --> 20:15.518
Boss, there's a rat in here!

20:19.914 --> 20:22.525
Yeah, 50 soft tacos,here I come!

20:24.005 --> 20:25.354
Come on, Grandma.

20:25.398 --> 20:26.312
We're family.

20:30.794 --> 20:33.406
Well, Emery,
at least youhave one.

20:33.449 --> 20:35.973
Although, if we
split it three ways...

20:36.017 --> 20:37.497
I'm spending mine
at the spa.

20:39.194 --> 20:40.848
Oh, you look just like
a candy cane.

20:42.458 --> 20:43.503
How you feeling?

20:43.546 --> 20:45.983
That was a pretty gruesome fall
you took on the ice.

20:46.027 --> 20:47.289
Hey, at leastit restored my faith

20:47.333 --> 20:49.291
in Orlando'smedical response team.

20:49.335 --> 20:52.076
That ambulance came fast.

20:56.951 --> 20:58.692
Oh, Louis.

20:59.649 --> 21:01.999
You know these would have been
50% off tomorrow.

21:02.043 --> 21:03.784
Jessica.
They're perfect.

21:15.578 --> 21:17.885
Hold my hand.I don't want to fall.

21:17.928 --> 21:22.193
Come on. You just push off to
the sides, and go -- like this!

21:22.237 --> 21:22.977
Oh!
Aah!

21:23.020 --> 21:26.372
My arms!
Ooooooh.
