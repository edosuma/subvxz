WEBVTT

00:10.359 --> 00:11.849
Previously on "Power"...

00:12.839 --> 00:14.603
This club is the dream.

00:14.759 --> 00:16.410
I have to admit I'm impressed.

00:16.559 --> 00:18.641
You run a smooth
operation here, James.

00:18.800 --> 00:21.565
When we met,
what'd you think I was gonna be?

00:21.719 --> 00:23.768
The biggest goddamn
drug dealer in New York City.

00:24.800 --> 00:27.041
Must be a reason you came
in the club the other night.

00:27.199 --> 00:29.407
I got you something,
one for each of us.

00:31.160 --> 00:32.570
Who can give us the
names, places, and dates

00:32.759 --> 00:34.045
we need to convict Lobos?

00:34.200 --> 00:36.201
We gotta open up this store
or Lobos will move on.

00:36.359 --> 00:39.329
I issued a warrant
for a Ruiz lieutenant, Nomar Arcielo.

00:39.479 --> 00:41.049
You want me
to rat on Felipe Lobos?

00:41.200 --> 00:42.770
Wait till you hear
who else Nomar called.

00:42.920 --> 00:45.207
- Isabel Ruiz.
- Víbora Ruiz's daughter?

00:45.359 --> 00:46.850
Isn't she 14?

00:47.000 --> 00:49.606
We do it right,
it'll shut this shit down for good.

00:49.759 --> 00:52.286
- And if it doesn't?
- Then we go to war.

00:52.439 --> 00:54.726
What the fuck?!

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074

02:21.650 --> 02:27.009
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

03:53.719 --> 03:56.086
Livin' the dream.

04:02.039 --> 04:03.564
The line should be
500 people long.

04:03.759 --> 04:05.762
And I just took
another bag of cash to the safe.

04:05.919 --> 04:07.365
Third time tonight.

04:07.520 --> 04:08.759
- Good, huh?
- Not bad.

04:08.919 --> 04:10.205
How's that compare
to Saturday night?

04:10.360 --> 04:12.088
I mean, it doesn't.

04:12.240 --> 04:14.846
To be fair, though,
it's a Tuesday.

04:16.759 --> 04:18.204
I'm gonna go
find us some blow, okay?

04:18.399 --> 04:19.925
Get this party started.

04:20.079 --> 04:21.524
I know you, don't I?

04:21.680 --> 04:24.490
- Are you an actress or model?
- I was in "Maxim" last month.

04:24.639 --> 04:26.802
Just a two-page spread,
accessories.

04:26.959 --> 04:28.689
I remember.
I liked it.

04:28.839 --> 04:30.968
So you really wanna party?

04:52.319 --> 04:54.846
Grabbed that org chart
of the Lobos cartel you asked for.

04:57.159 --> 04:59.002
Wanna eat or work first?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.240
You really think Lobos
only meets his distributor

05:03.399 --> 05:04.810
twice a year?

05:04.959 --> 05:06.644
I was thinking
we should take another look

05:06.800 --> 05:08.882
at the Federales' records.

05:09.879 --> 05:11.165
What?

05:11.319 --> 05:13.163
You're inspiring
a third option.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.403
What's wrong?

05:17.560 --> 05:19.244
Nothing.

05:24.480 --> 05:26.369
Frankie warned me
to stay focused.

05:26.519 --> 05:27.600
- Mm-hmm.
- We should work.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.848
Mm-hmm.
We will.

05:30.839 --> 05:32.329
After.

05:49.560 --> 05:51.050
I was thinking

05:51.240 --> 05:53.367
Lobos must be
using a proxy for his...

05:55.199 --> 05:57.600
...regular communication.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.485
Oh, shit, that's amazing.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.011
So, move over, then.

06:12.160 --> 06:14.367
All right, hold on.
Wait your turn.

06:22.519 --> 06:25.490
But I was thinking if we open up
a fifth night every week,

06:25.639 --> 06:28.769
it's that much more money,
that much more exposure.

06:28.920 --> 06:31.526
Too much exposure.
It's called overexposure.

06:31.680 --> 06:32.920
Make the 500 people wait.

06:34.319 --> 06:35.923
- What?
- Come here.

06:36.120 --> 06:37.564
- Help!
- Move her head.

06:37.720 --> 06:39.245
Wake up.
Fuck off!

06:39.399 --> 06:41.242
Sabrina, oh, my God.
Sabrina!

06:41.399 --> 06:44.449
- Get the medics now!
- How horrible!

06:44.600 --> 06:46.682
Out. And have someone
block the door!

06:46.879 --> 06:48.769
Redirect traffic
to the women's room upstairs.

06:48.920 --> 06:51.206
- What did she take?
- Oh, my God.

06:51.360 --> 06:53.442
Sweetheart, listen to me.
Listen to me.

06:53.639 --> 06:56.245
- What did she take?
- Blow. Coke.

06:56.399 --> 06:58.925
- But she only did two lines.
- Are you sure?

06:59.920 --> 07:01.603
Cocaine
cut with some bad shit.

07:01.759 --> 07:03.603
- Hey, hey, hey, ma'am?
- Help her!

07:03.759 --> 07:05.000
Wake up, wake up!

07:05.160 --> 07:07.605
Come with me.
Come here.

07:07.759 --> 07:09.329
We gotta cut
the strap off.

07:09.480 --> 07:12.324
- Miss, can you hear me?
- Start compressions.

07:12.480 --> 07:15.130
I almost did a line.
Oh, my God.

07:15.279 --> 07:17.487
- Five, six, seven, eight...
- Is she gonna be okay?

07:18.480 --> 07:20.880
- I got a pulse.
- Yo, Jim, bring an ambulance around.

07:21.079 --> 07:22.764
Okay, listen to me.
Look.

07:22.959 --> 07:24.644
There's gonna be
an ambulance downstairs,

07:24.839 --> 07:26.649
it's gonna take both of you
to the hospital, okay?

07:26.839 --> 07:28.841
When you get to the hospital,
they're gonna ask you what happened.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.728
No. No, no!
No, I can't say anything

07:30.879 --> 07:32.211
because her mom will kill her
and it'll be--

07:32.360 --> 07:34.805
Look, if you keep your mouth shut,
she'll die anyway.

07:34.959 --> 07:37.122
It was bad coke.

07:37.279 --> 07:40.682
That's what happened.
That's all you have to tell 'em.

07:42.319 --> 07:44.560
Told you having our own EMTs
was worth every penny.

07:44.720 --> 07:47.120
10 minutes we would've waited
for 9-1-1, she'd be dead already.

07:47.319 --> 07:49.641
Plus, no police, no press.
No one's the wiser.

07:49.800 --> 07:52.086
And you,
all that bad coke shit?

07:52.279 --> 07:54.805
Impressive.
Let me grab you a drink, boss.

07:54.959 --> 07:56.769
- I don't drink anymore.
- Still, you should celebrate.

07:56.920 --> 07:59.081
When's the last time
you saved a life?

08:13.160 --> 08:17.165
See, endorphins
make everything better.

08:20.519 --> 08:22.601
Endorphins
don't help catch Lobos.

08:22.759 --> 08:25.889
And you're half-naked
and still thinking about work.

08:26.040 --> 08:28.440
I don't know whether
to be offended or impressed.

08:33.558 --> 08:35.642
What the fuck?

08:35.799 --> 08:37.643
You got a relay call
from the office.

08:37.799 --> 08:38.801
There goes mine.

08:38.960 --> 08:40.883
Looks like we're up.

08:55.519 --> 08:56.520
Hey, baby.

08:56.720 --> 08:58.643
Bed's awfully empty.

08:58.799 --> 09:00.722
You coming home soon?

09:00.879 --> 09:02.120
Yeah, soon.

09:02.279 --> 09:05.044
Had a crazy night here.
Girl got some bad coke.

09:05.200 --> 09:07.645
- She lived, but...
- Not our product.

09:07.799 --> 09:10.041
Tasha, we don't do that here.

09:10.200 --> 09:13.885
Then what's the problem?
Come home.

09:14.039 --> 09:15.404
Yeah.

09:15.559 --> 09:17.049
Soon as I'm done here,
I'll come straight home.

09:17.240 --> 09:18.889
Okay.

09:19.879 --> 09:21.404
Bye, baby.

09:47.559 --> 09:50.245
Fucking classic.
He wanted to meet us here?

09:52.759 --> 09:56.081
I know it's your task force,
but he's technically my C.I.

09:56.279 --> 09:59.010
There's a protocol, so I'll lead
the interview, write the report.

09:59.200 --> 10:00.565
What are you insinuating?

10:00.720 --> 10:02.562
Not insinuating anything,
cowgirl.

10:04.679 --> 10:06.841
I'm saying we both know
you'll cut corners to get a win.

10:07.039 --> 10:08.565
In the courtroom, it's fine.

10:08.720 --> 10:10.961
But the rules in the field--
follow them.

10:11.120 --> 10:12.610
Here we go.

10:23.799 --> 10:26.451
- No, no, no, no.
- Maricón.

10:26.639 --> 10:29.610
Good to see you, too, papi.
Over here.

10:29.759 --> 10:30.921
Stay right here.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.411
What do you got for us?

10:45.360 --> 10:46.485
He says he's not talking to you.

10:46.639 --> 10:48.721
Mm.
Yeah, I got the gist, thanks.

10:50.360 --> 10:51.770
You called us.

10:51.960 --> 10:54.167
So I assume you have some
information on Felipe Lobos--

10:54.320 --> 10:56.606
you know, some sort of video,
audio recording.

10:56.799 --> 10:59.928
Maybe a photograph or two
or a tip.

11:00.080 --> 11:03.447
Who sells Lobos' drugs
and when and how it happens.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.727
- Yeah, I got your tip.
- Mm-hmm.

11:46.879 --> 11:48.722
Where the fuck you been?

11:48.879 --> 11:50.086
Thought you died in there.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.004
Wild night, man.

11:56.240 --> 11:59.049
Come on, we got business
to discuss, real business.

11:59.200 --> 12:00.725
Okay, go.

12:00.879 --> 12:02.847
Retail side's
been locked up tight

12:03.000 --> 12:04.729
since we sent
those body parts around town.

12:04.879 --> 12:07.884
We're getting a big distro shipment
coming in day after next.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.410
How are the corners?

12:09.559 --> 12:11.528
Pretty fucking quiet.

12:11.679 --> 12:13.250
Everyone knows a re-up's coming.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.004
They'll be watching us.

12:16.120 --> 12:17.530
It's time.
Tell Julio.

12:19.559 --> 12:22.245
Let's take a ride.
Tell him yourself.

12:22.399 --> 12:26.245
Nah. Gotta get home.
Tasha's expecting me.

12:26.399 --> 12:29.768
Oh, we gotta replace the girl
who got slashed, the courier.

12:29.919 --> 12:32.605
Julio already handled it.
White chick, nice tits.

12:34.080 --> 12:36.559
- I'll catch you later.
- Later.

12:38.840 --> 12:41.524
Tommy told me you got shook
at the chop shop the other night.

12:42.919 --> 12:44.365
I was good.

12:45.879 --> 12:47.609
First chop shop I saw,

12:47.759 --> 12:49.250
dude's head fell,
rolled across the floor

12:49.399 --> 12:51.084
like a goddamn bowling ball.

12:51.240 --> 12:53.322
Scared the shit out of me.

12:53.480 --> 12:56.323
- Actually, your pops was there.
- He was?

12:56.480 --> 12:59.005
It's okay to admit it fucked
you up for a minute, Shawn.

12:59.159 --> 13:01.322
And he said it to me,
so I'm saying it to you.

13:01.480 --> 13:04.289
It was Kanan who taught us
how to hold a saw.

13:04.440 --> 13:07.409
He did? Jesus.
I didn't know he was like Tommy.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.524
Pull over.

13:14.639 --> 13:16.448
Look at me.

13:16.600 --> 13:19.409
Ain't nobody like Tommy.

13:19.559 --> 13:21.961
I'll talk to him.

13:22.120 --> 13:23.803
I don't need you
being a part of the game like that.

13:23.960 --> 13:26.121
Told your father
I'd take care of you.

13:27.320 --> 13:29.561
Pops doesn't know shit
about taking care of me.

13:29.720 --> 13:33.087
You need to go see him, kid.
Don’t judge him.

13:33.240 --> 13:36.084
Kanan did
what he had to do to survive.

13:38.399 --> 13:40.163
We all do.

14:24.360 --> 14:27.283
Hurry up, sleepyhead!
Our appointment's at 10:00.

14:27.440 --> 14:29.885
Yeah, I can't go with you today.

14:30.039 --> 14:32.929
The thing that happened
last night at the club with the girl...

14:33.080 --> 14:35.287
I know you ain't serious.

14:35.440 --> 14:37.919
- It's the first of the month.
- I know.

14:38.080 --> 14:40.081
We dress nice,
we go in, all on the books.

14:40.240 --> 14:41.446
We meet with the bankers.

14:41.600 --> 14:44.443
This Mr. and Mrs. Black Enterprise shit
was your idea.

14:44.600 --> 14:47.888
Yeah, but I think you can
handle it now... math team.

14:48.039 --> 14:49.928
- Did you guys wear uniforms?

14:50.080 --> 14:52.162
I shoulda never
told you about that.

14:52.320 --> 14:55.085
You can never let it go.

14:55.240 --> 14:58.288
Come on, Ghost,
we always go together.

14:58.440 --> 14:59.965
I don't wanna go alone.

15:00.120 --> 15:02.282
I gotta go to the club, baby.

15:04.080 --> 15:05.969
You are a smart girl.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.849
You got this.

15:12.679 --> 15:16.081
I accompanied Agent Knox
to meet with our C.I. Nomar Arcielo.

15:16.240 --> 15:18.004
I think he's gonna be
a great asset

15:18.159 --> 15:19.764
in our search
for Lobos' distributor.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.605
- He seemed evasive.
- He needs encouragement, sure.

15:22.759 --> 15:24.841
Encouragement
isn't gonna do anything.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.764
Street soldier like Nomar
doesn't know shit.

15:26.919 --> 15:28.081
We should be honing in
on the primeras

15:28.279 --> 15:29.441
who get Lobos' product.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.090
The only primera we know is Ruiz.

15:31.279 --> 15:32.519
Yeah, but there are more.

15:32.679 --> 15:34.283
We find them,
they lead us to the distributor.

15:34.440 --> 15:36.601
- It's not your call.
- It's my call.

15:36.759 --> 15:38.602
Agent Knox,
follow up with Nomar.

15:38.759 --> 15:40.761
It's worth one more visit
if we can squeeze something out.

15:40.960 --> 15:42.290
We're on it.

15:45.399 --> 15:46.686
If you two are so confident,

15:46.879 --> 15:48.450
start your search
for the big dogs.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.328
See what you can unearth.

15:50.480 --> 15:51.970
Looking forward to it.

15:52.120 --> 15:54.884
- Morning, boss.
- Kantos.

15:55.039 --> 15:57.121
"Which fresh-faced,
up-and-coming model

15:57.279 --> 15:58.963
almost died
while powdering her nose

15:59.120 --> 16:01.168
at the hottest new club
in the Meatpacking District?

16:01.320 --> 16:03.322
This story's no lie."

16:03.519 --> 16:05.124
I know I said
having in-house medics

16:05.279 --> 16:06.566
would help us
to avoid bad press,

16:06.720 --> 16:08.484
but the bathroom
was full of drunk women.

16:08.639 --> 16:10.768
What I wanna know is,
who sold her blow in my club?

16:10.919 --> 16:12.490
Bad, fucked-up,
stepped-on blow.

16:12.639 --> 16:13.879
Drugs are part
of the game, boss.

16:14.039 --> 16:15.565
People want to
get high and party.

16:15.720 --> 16:18.326
We do our best to control it, but it's
part of the business that we're in.

16:18.480 --> 16:20.322
You need to control
who gets in here, period.

16:22.200 --> 16:25.169
So now that the cops know
drugs are getting sold in here,

16:25.320 --> 16:26.480
will they send 'em in straight up

16:26.639 --> 16:27.879
or plainclothes cats or what?

16:28.039 --> 16:29.565
I know you know how they work.

16:31.320 --> 16:32.845
They, uh-- ahem--

16:33.000 --> 16:34.365
come in the front door, usually.

16:34.519 --> 16:36.522
Sniff around, they mess with us,

16:36.720 --> 16:39.610
call us a public health menace,
we get shut down.

16:39.759 --> 16:42.000
Before we get Cynthia Sheridan
to sign a contract,

16:42.159 --> 16:43.889
we get shut down,
people move on, no way.

16:44.039 --> 16:46.326
Like you said, boss,
I know how the cops work.

16:46.519 --> 16:47.850
Let me show you something.

17:13.759 --> 17:15.568
Shipment tomorrow morning,
you and Victor.

17:15.759 --> 17:17.046
- It's on.
- All right.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.723
That's Liliana
who just walked in?

17:18.880 --> 17:21.247
- Yeah.
- Wow, that is one fucked-up grill.

17:21.400 --> 17:22.810
Hey, dog,

17:22.960 --> 17:24.723
she's doing good
with the count, though, man.

17:24.880 --> 17:25.881
Glad she's good at something,

17:26.039 --> 17:27.723
'cause ain't no one
gonna fuck her again.

17:29.240 --> 17:31.083
I'd bet my dick
she's gonna snitch someday.

17:31.240 --> 17:33.208
Yo, you want me
to take her out right now?

17:33.400 --> 17:36.131
Nah.

17:36.319 --> 17:38.003
We find the dealer ourselves

17:38.200 --> 17:39.884
and deliver him
straight to the NYPD.

17:40.039 --> 17:41.371
I don't fuck with cops.

17:41.519 --> 17:42.726
Yeah, but maybe you should.

17:42.880 --> 17:44.608
We save them work,
they get an arrest,

17:44.759 --> 17:46.364
and they leave us alone.

17:47.440 --> 17:49.089
What's this?

17:49.240 --> 17:51.083
I've got the names of everyone
who's stepped foot in Truth.

17:51.240 --> 17:53.402
- We swipe their licenses at the door.
- No shit.

17:53.559 --> 17:56.244
Name, birth date,
height, weight, hair color.

17:56.400 --> 17:59.131
- Address?
- Address, yeah.

17:59.279 --> 18:00.930
Anything on a driver's license.

18:01.079 --> 18:03.446
I was looking
for any familiar names

18:03.640 --> 18:04.766
to narrow down our search.

18:04.920 --> 18:07.126
I know a lot of dealers
from back in the day.

18:07.279 --> 18:08.805
This go all the way back
to opening night?

18:08.960 --> 18:10.564
Yup.

18:10.720 --> 18:12.926
So until we find this guy,
I think we should consult a lawyer.

18:13.079 --> 18:14.569
I mean, I don't want this girl
to read the "Post,"

18:14.720 --> 18:16.289
see a payday, and try to sue.

18:16.440 --> 18:18.760
- I got a guy on retainer. He's a--
- I know a lawyer.

18:18.920 --> 18:21.126
- My guy specializes in this stuff.
- I got it.

18:22.200 --> 18:24.406
That tech stock you bought
with our money...

18:24.559 --> 18:25.924
risky move, isn't it?

18:26.119 --> 18:28.087
Yeah, well, given the size
of your portfolio,

18:28.240 --> 18:29.605
I wasn't really so worried.

18:29.759 --> 18:32.286
Those Wash 'n' Folds
really seemed to pay off for you

18:32.440 --> 18:33.680
and Mr. St. Patrick.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.290
That's why
it's a great business, Alex.

18:35.440 --> 18:38.125
People always have dirty laundry.

18:59.559 --> 19:01.324
What the fuck?

19:07.559 --> 19:10.131
If everything's satisfac--

19:10.279 --> 19:12.044
Pull up that goddamn log.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.288
Kantos said he knew a lawyer,

19:29.480 --> 19:31.163
I told him I had a better option.

19:31.319 --> 19:33.448
I don't usually do
in-person consultations,

19:33.599 --> 19:36.000
but just this once
I'll make an exception.

19:36.160 --> 19:38.605
Oh.

19:38.759 --> 19:40.523
I'm sorry about the other day.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.364
You had to work.
I get it.

19:42.519 --> 19:45.410
But it does feel like you're
always running off somewhere.

19:45.559 --> 19:46.560
You'd think
I'd be used to it by now.

19:46.720 --> 19:48.244
Oh.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.209
Not gonna let me off
that easy, are you?

19:50.359 --> 19:52.124
Nope.

19:52.279 --> 19:54.681
So you think the girl
really has a case?

19:54.880 --> 19:56.847
Let's not use the word "case."

19:57.000 --> 19:59.890
Look, as a lawyer,
I shouldn't be here at all.

20:00.039 --> 20:02.361
But as your friend,
I'd say

20:02.519 --> 20:04.442
someone ODs in your club,
you have limited liability

20:04.640 --> 20:07.371
unless you provided the drugs,
which obviously you didn't.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
So when I get in there...

20:10.160 --> 20:11.730
I think you should talk to her,

20:11.880 --> 20:13.325
ask her how she's doing.

20:13.519 --> 20:15.807
Show her you care.

20:15.960 --> 20:17.609
It's not about
getting out of a lawsuit,

20:17.759 --> 20:20.730
it's about avoiding
getting into one in the first place.

20:20.880 --> 20:22.803
My manager thinks
we should work with the cops

20:22.960 --> 20:24.371
to find the dealer,
but you know,

20:24.519 --> 20:26.409
coming from our neighborhood,
that's a terrible idea, right?

20:26.559 --> 20:29.244
- Not necessarily.
- Shit.

20:29.400 --> 20:32.131
Coming up,
NYPD was 007.

20:32.279 --> 20:34.759
That badge gave them
license to kill.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.769
We'd see the cops coming
and we'd run.

20:36.960 --> 20:38.689
Even if we were just
hanging on the corner, remember?

20:38.880 --> 20:40.608
I remember.

20:40.799 --> 20:42.369
Not all cops are like that.

20:42.519 --> 20:45.090
It's not a bad idea
to have a few on your side.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.367
- Come up with me.
- Nah.

20:49.559 --> 20:50.641
The whole thing goes sideways

20:50.799 --> 20:53.040
if she thinks you brought
a lawyer to cover your ass,

20:53.200 --> 20:54.611
even though you kind of did.

20:56.160 --> 20:57.923
Yeah.

20:58.079 --> 21:01.084
Guess we could've done this
on the phone.

21:01.279 --> 21:03.487
- You didn't need to come.
- Yeah, I did.

21:03.640 --> 21:06.529
I mean, you've worked
so hard for the club,

21:06.680 --> 21:08.807
I wanna make sure
it all works out.

21:16.839 --> 21:18.648
Chardonnay at the lower bar.

21:18.799 --> 21:21.121
Do champagne up top,
near VIP.

21:22.680 --> 21:25.160
- Mrs. St. Patrick.
- ls my husband upstairs?

21:25.319 --> 21:26.445
He went out.

21:26.599 --> 21:28.010
You want me to let him know
you stopped by?

21:28.160 --> 21:30.640
Don't worry yourself about it.
I'll wait in his office.

21:30.799 --> 21:32.325
It's probably locked.

21:32.519 --> 21:33.851
Then I'll need the key.

21:41.319 --> 21:42.684
Looks good.
Blood pressure's good.

21:42.839 --> 21:44.171
Call me if you need anything.

21:44.359 --> 21:45.724
Just press the button.

21:47.279 --> 21:49.964
I'm James St. Patrick,

21:50.160 --> 21:51.809
the owner of the nightclub
where you...

21:53.519 --> 21:56.090
How you feeling?

21:59.000 --> 22:01.923
My mother is flying in
from the Ukraine.

22:02.079 --> 22:05.049
My agency, they want me
to go to rehab.

22:07.240 --> 22:08.730
I can't believe this happened.

22:10.759 --> 22:13.047
You're not the first person
to use drugs.

22:14.319 --> 22:17.449
And you're not the first person
to buy bad drugs off an asshole.

22:18.839 --> 22:20.922
I feel pretty stupid.

22:21.079 --> 22:23.526
This kind of a bad thing,
maybe it's the push you need

22:23.680 --> 22:25.170
to start heading
in a better direction.

22:30.519 --> 22:34.240
This asshole dealer,
you happen to remember his name,

22:34.400 --> 22:37.050
- what he looks like?
- No.

22:37.200 --> 22:40.044
I don't want this
to happen to anyone else.

23:16.240 --> 23:20.325
Hey there.
Have you seen James?

23:20.480 --> 23:21.560
Big boss isn't here yet.

23:21.720 --> 23:23.721
Big boss?
What's that make me?

23:27.920 --> 23:30.923
Hey, what's your name?

23:31.079 --> 23:32.205
Why would that matter?

23:32.359 --> 23:34.601
I want to know more about you,
that's all.

23:34.759 --> 23:36.285
You want to fuck me.

23:36.440 --> 23:38.203
Don't need
to know my name for that.

23:40.599 --> 23:42.602
Hey, listen,
what do I need to say here?

23:42.759 --> 23:45.047
I don't know.
Come up with something.

23:46.240 --> 23:48.083
See you later, boss.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.650
What the fuck is her problem?

23:53.799 --> 23:55.882
She's a bitch.

23:56.079 --> 23:58.287
So you one of my bosses, too?

23:58.440 --> 24:01.807
I am.

24:04.640 --> 24:07.483
I'm Tommy.
And your name is?

24:07.640 --> 24:11.166
- Dominique.
- Dominique.

24:11.319 --> 24:13.971
So you like working here,
Dominique?

24:17.599 --> 24:20.125
Yeah, suing was
the last thing on her mind.

24:20.279 --> 24:22.487
She's just a scared kid.

24:22.640 --> 24:25.040
You were right
about talking to her.

24:27.880 --> 24:30.121
Um, let me buy you lunch
as a thank-you.

24:31.640 --> 24:33.926
I can't.
I gotta go.

24:34.079 --> 24:35.319
Things are blowing up at work.

24:35.480 --> 24:36.924
Again.

24:39.200 --> 24:41.487
- That day in the museum...
- Mm-hmm.

24:41.640 --> 24:44.848
My boss told me
not to get distracted.

24:45.039 --> 24:47.884
But somehow
when it comes to you...

24:48.039 --> 24:51.009
Well, then stay.

24:51.160 --> 24:53.127
Let's just go.

24:53.279 --> 24:55.759
Be alone for a while.

24:59.559 --> 25:02.643
I want to, but...

25:05.200 --> 25:06.849
Bye, Jamie.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.525
We thought
we'd shift our focus.

25:33.680 --> 25:35.728
Aníbal Santalises is a primera

25:35.880 --> 25:38.247
of the Sangre Fuerte
set of Hermanos Taínos.

25:38.400 --> 25:40.128
Came onto our radar
because last week

25:40.279 --> 25:42.202
he received a special delivery.

25:42.359 --> 25:43.724
Severed human foot.

25:43.880 --> 25:45.211
- Shit.
- What are you talking about?

25:45.359 --> 25:46.566
You sat on this for a week?

25:46.720 --> 25:48.403
My contact just got back to me.

25:48.559 --> 25:50.085
This has Lobos
written all over it.

25:50.240 --> 25:51.605
That's pure speculation.

25:51.759 --> 25:53.568
My contacts on the street

25:53.720 --> 25:56.007
believe that Ruiz
got sent an appendage, too.

25:57.119 --> 25:59.281
We know Ruiz
is connected to Lobos,

25:59.440 --> 26:00.601
so maybe Anibal is, too.

26:00.759 --> 26:02.887
This is ridiculous.
I didn't authorize this.

26:03.079 --> 26:04.080
I did.

26:04.240 --> 26:06.846
It's speculation,
but it's worth following up on.

26:07.039 --> 26:08.769
Nice work.

26:08.960 --> 26:11.008
Could Frankie and I
have the room?

26:21.240 --> 26:23.766
I really wish you'd told me
you authorized this.

26:23.920 --> 26:26.082
I need to be in the loop
on this investigation.

26:26.240 --> 26:29.686
You're here.
You're officially in all loops.

26:29.839 --> 26:34.084
Let me ask you this.
What is your goal here?

26:34.279 --> 26:36.759
- I don't know what you mean.
- You see?

26:36.920 --> 26:38.604
I gave you an opportunity to say,

26:38.759 --> 26:42.366
"The successful prosecution
of Felipe Lobos."

26:43.359 --> 26:45.931
You're not here
to beat Saxe or Medina.

26:46.119 --> 26:48.691
We're here together,
all of us,

26:48.839 --> 26:51.683
to put a fucking
drug dealer in jail.

26:51.880 --> 26:55.520
Any move that gets us
closer to that result

26:55.680 --> 26:58.286
is the best move, right?

26:58.440 --> 26:59.601
Right.

26:59.799 --> 27:03.770
And with Nomar,
you have anything new?

27:07.000 --> 27:08.808
That's what I thought.

27:19.039 --> 27:20.769
Ready?

27:50.519 --> 27:52.328
Thanks.

27:52.519 --> 27:55.000
Flatfeet are a bitch.

27:55.160 --> 27:57.127
You're lucky you got
your mama's.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.844
So you got any news
from that doctor you been seeing?

28:02.000 --> 28:04.001
Nothing new.

28:04.200 --> 28:06.362
Well, what'd he say?

28:06.519 --> 28:07.851
No improvement.

28:08.039 --> 28:10.087
The treatment didn't work.
My knee's busted for good.

28:10.240 --> 28:12.048
Then find another doctor.
It's only been six months.

28:12.200 --> 28:14.362
I gotta face it, Pops.
I can't ball anymore.

28:16.039 --> 28:18.201
So you gotta face it, too.

28:23.359 --> 28:25.124
So what you doing instead?

28:25.279 --> 28:26.724
I got a new job.

28:28.480 --> 28:30.130
Driving Uncle G.

28:30.279 --> 28:32.281
And he says hey,
by the way.

28:32.480 --> 28:34.881
And when you get out, he's got
a whole franchise all ready for you.

28:38.640 --> 28:40.846
I always-- I always knew
this day would come, man.

28:43.400 --> 28:45.561
He treat you right?

28:45.720 --> 28:47.050
Yeah, he does.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.083
He keeps telling me
about you, too.

28:52.319 --> 28:53.970
What you taught him,

28:54.119 --> 28:55.769
how close y'all were.

28:57.720 --> 28:59.608
I guess I got a lot to learn.

29:03.240 --> 29:06.403
Listen, if you ever need
to talk about some shit going down,

29:06.559 --> 29:08.243
some shit you can't tell Ghost...

29:10.079 --> 29:12.923
Burner.
Guards keep me stocked.

29:16.759 --> 29:18.807
I know you gonna
do me proud, son.

29:24.599 --> 29:27.205
Come on, gotta move.

29:27.359 --> 29:29.521
Let's go.

29:29.680 --> 29:30.920
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

29:31.119 --> 29:33.599
Help the fuck out
or fuck the fuck off.

29:33.759 --> 29:35.046
All right.

29:35.200 --> 29:37.281
What, do you think we're hosting
a party here this morning?

29:37.440 --> 29:39.124
Nah, I'm fucking
the doughnut chick.

29:39.279 --> 29:41.520
- And you get free doughnuts?
- Mm.

29:43.160 --> 29:45.366
- Shit, yeah, as many as I want.
- Think I could bang her, too?

29:45.519 --> 29:47.965
Let's go.

29:55.799 --> 29:57.961
- Usual drop?
- No doubt.

29:58.119 --> 29:59.280
All right, bet.

30:01.480 --> 30:02.970
Doughnuts are good, man.

30:03.119 --> 30:04.690
Man, you and those
fucking doughnuts, dog.

30:07.799 --> 30:09.801
Get out of the fucking car, now.

30:12.519 --> 30:13.931
Hands up.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.766
Put it down.

30:20.039 --> 30:22.930
You, too, get the fuck out.
By the wall.

30:23.079 --> 30:24.365
Let's go.

30:26.200 --> 30:27.884
All right, man, hey,
calm the fuck down, all right?

30:28.039 --> 30:29.848
Shut the fuck up.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.808
Turn around.

30:31.960 --> 30:33.689
I just want the van.
Nobody's got to get hurt.

30:33.839 --> 30:35.568
That's not the way I see it.

30:35.720 --> 30:37.608
The way I see it,
you're gonna get hurt real bad

30:37.759 --> 30:39.887
unless you tell me
what I need to know.

30:40.039 --> 30:43.646
Has Nomar Arcielo called in?
He hasn't answered my--

30:43.799 --> 30:46.565
Agent Knox's last few attempts
to make contact.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.210
Of course he recognizes
the number.

30:49.359 --> 30:51.009
He's ignoring us on purpose.

31:04.640 --> 31:07.371
Nomar, call in now.

31:08.759 --> 31:10.410
Fuck this.
Fuck protocol.

31:33.119 --> 31:35.087
- Yeah.
- Got the guy.

31:35.240 --> 31:36.730
Victor's got the product.

31:36.880 --> 31:38.404
Okay, we need a name, who sent him,

31:38.559 --> 31:39.721
how'd they know
where to find us?

31:39.880 --> 31:41.644
Duh, I'm on it.

31:41.799 --> 31:43.244
You don't got Shawn
with you, do you?

31:43.400 --> 31:45.242
- Nope.
- All right.

31:45.400 --> 31:47.561
I know you liked popping his cherry
on the wetwork in the warehouse,

31:47.720 --> 31:48.960
but I want you
to lay off for a while.

31:49.119 --> 31:52.169
And I want you
to move that Dominique girl

31:52.319 --> 31:54.128
to the VIP section at the club.

31:54.279 --> 31:56.681
She's good.

31:56.839 --> 31:58.079
Good at what?

31:58.240 --> 31:59.651
I told you not to touch
the merchandise, Tommy.

32:03.599 --> 32:05.250
Like that.

32:09.079 --> 32:12.323
Ghost, we need to talk.

32:12.480 --> 32:13.605
I got to get to the club, babe.

32:13.759 --> 32:15.648
Big surprise.

32:15.799 --> 32:17.608
- Okay.
- You want to know what's going on?

32:17.759 --> 32:19.250
I'm trying to find the dealer
that sold that girl

32:19.400 --> 32:20.924
the bad shit
that almost killed her

32:21.119 --> 32:22.451
so we can turn him over
to the cops.

32:22.599 --> 32:23.964
So now you're a snitch?

32:24.119 --> 32:26.167
That's what you take
from all that?

32:26.319 --> 32:29.324
- Daddy.
- It's okay, baby. It's okay.

32:29.480 --> 32:30.810
I got a business to run...
we keep the cops happy,

32:30.960 --> 32:32.325
which keeps 'em
off our backs, that's it.

32:32.480 --> 32:34.209
As long as I've known you,
you ain't never been worried

32:34.359 --> 32:36.009
about keeping no cops happy.

32:36.160 --> 32:37.650
You want to do this right now?

32:37.799 --> 32:39.608
Nah, I don't.

32:39.759 --> 32:41.761
Okay, baby.

32:41.920 --> 32:43.922
Come on, honey.

32:44.079 --> 32:46.287
Come on,
let's go find Big Mama.

32:46.480 --> 32:48.049
I got some business
to take care of.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.406
Every time I say something like,

32:50.559 --> 32:51.799
"Tell me who you're working for,"

32:51.960 --> 32:53.689
I feel like I'm
in an old movie, you know?

32:53.839 --> 32:55.443
It's like fuckin'
Al Capone over here.

32:55.599 --> 32:58.125
- Fuckin' Capone?
- That's right.

32:58.279 --> 33:00.362
Hey, hey.

33:02.039 --> 33:04.008
Who's your
favorite gangster of all time?

33:04.160 --> 33:06.002
Luciano?

33:06.160 --> 33:08.002
Escobar, right?

33:08.160 --> 33:10.446
Everybody loves the classics.

33:14.599 --> 33:16.284
Okay, then.

33:25.160 --> 33:27.321
Tell me who you're working for

33:27.519 --> 33:29.840
or we're gonna have a little fun.

33:36.720 --> 33:40.611
Hola.

33:53.759 --> 33:55.285
All I had to do was look
for the closest

33:55.440 --> 33:57.249
Catholic school
to your house.

34:00.200 --> 34:03.727
You know
I've been looking for you.

34:40.760 --> 34:42.284
Eh?

35:05.719 --> 35:06.925
Stop.

35:07.119 --> 35:09.009
Hey, yo, Tommy, man,
come on, dog.

35:09.159 --> 35:11.242
What are you doing?

35:28.719 --> 35:30.688
Give him another second.

35:36.679 --> 35:38.010
What were you
supposed to do with the van

35:38.159 --> 35:40.048
once you got it off us?

35:40.239 --> 35:43.483
I was supposed to drive it
to a parking lot in Brooklyn,

35:43.639 --> 35:44.971
park it, and walk away.

35:45.159 --> 35:46.889
Who was
supposed to pick it up?

35:50.639 --> 35:53.563
Oh.

35:56.320 --> 35:57.889
Hey, yo, man, talk.

36:02.559 --> 36:04.085
You got 10 seconds.

36:04.239 --> 36:08.802
- One, two, three, four...

36:08.960 --> 36:10.199
Five, six, seven.

36:14.639 --> 36:16.880
Okay, okay.

36:17.039 --> 36:19.007
Okay, okay, okay.

36:26.199 --> 36:31.969
- She said--
- She? It was a woman?

36:46.079 --> 36:47.764
She says we were
doing it for some guy.

36:47.920 --> 36:50.570
I don't know his name.

36:50.719 --> 36:51.880
"Then say good-bye

36:52.039 --> 36:53.121
to your little friend."

36:53.280 --> 36:54.280
You see what I did there?

36:54.480 --> 36:56.800
"Scarface."

36:56.960 --> 36:59.327
You should've laughed,
motherfucker.

36:59.480 --> 37:02.130
She called him El Gordo.

37:02.320 --> 37:04.766
That's Anibal.

37:06.880 --> 37:08.722
Este hombre...

37:24.280 --> 37:25.405
You're right.

37:25.559 --> 37:28.085
I am a bruja with a badge.

37:28.239 --> 37:31.608
You keep fucking with me,
I can shoot you in the street

37:31.760 --> 37:33.922
in cold blood,
say it's self-defense.

37:34.079 --> 37:36.208
No one will bat a fucking eye.

37:36.360 --> 37:38.442
So you're gonna talk to me
about this guy

37:38.599 --> 37:41.762
who got a fucking foot
in the mail last week.

37:41.920 --> 37:44.570
I need to know what the fuck
is going on, Nomar.

37:44.719 --> 37:47.610
I need to know
what I'm dealing with.

37:48.679 --> 37:51.728
That guy got a foot?

37:51.880 --> 37:53.768
I heard Ruiz got a head.

37:55.719 --> 37:57.960
According to the victim,
our dealer is dark-haired,

37:58.119 --> 37:59.280
clean-cut, tall.

37:59.440 --> 38:01.123
Basically
your average pinstripe prick.

38:01.280 --> 38:04.204
His first name is Scott.
All right, here's the deal.

38:04.360 --> 38:06.282
We need everybody
to keep your eyes open.

38:06.440 --> 38:09.090
Everyone. Ladies, if you
catch this piece of shit in action

38:09.239 --> 38:11.447
selling this bullshit in here,
you hand him over to me

38:11.639 --> 38:13.927
and I hand you back
a big, fat bonus check.

38:14.079 --> 38:15.844
Double a night's pay.

38:16.000 --> 38:20.527
Oh, and do whatever it takes.
There are no rules.

38:20.679 --> 38:21.965
You heard him.

38:22.119 --> 38:23.565
All right, let's get to work.
Open the doors.

38:23.719 --> 38:25.483
Do whatever it takes, huh?

38:25.639 --> 38:27.563
Guess you
haven't changed after all.

38:27.719 --> 38:30.485
We need to talk.
Now.

38:35.480 --> 38:38.005
Tasha, whatever's gotten into you,
we're gonna talk about it at home.

38:38.159 --> 38:39.684
This is my place of business.

38:39.840 --> 38:43.048
Your business is the only
place I can get your attention.

38:44.039 --> 38:45.610
I went to the bank.

38:45.800 --> 38:47.528
I saw the vault.

38:48.519 --> 38:50.204
Did you think
I wouldn't notice?

38:50.360 --> 38:52.442
Did you think
I wouldn't notice what you took?

38:52.639 --> 38:55.530
I had to use that money
to open the club.

38:55.679 --> 38:58.331
It had to be a cashier's check
from our legit account.

38:58.519 --> 39:00.409
Couldn't give the state liquor
motherfucker

39:00.559 --> 39:02.402
a stack of hundreds
covered in coke dust.

39:03.840 --> 39:05.170
And truth is, Tasha,
it's my money.

39:05.360 --> 39:07.010
Don't you dare
start that shit, Ghost.

39:07.159 --> 39:09.400
I helped you earn
every goddamn penny.

39:09.559 --> 39:13.610
You could've told me up front
how much this club would cost.

39:13.760 --> 39:15.922
You could've said something.

39:16.119 --> 39:18.690
But you sent me into that bank
like boo-boo the fool

39:18.840 --> 39:20.682
don't know shit
about what you're doing.

39:20.840 --> 39:22.489
You saw how much money
we got in there.

39:22.639 --> 39:24.688
We ain't in no danger
of going broke.

39:24.880 --> 39:27.451
It ain't about the money.

39:27.599 --> 39:30.922
Since when do you lie to me?
Since when do you hide shit?

39:31.079 --> 39:33.400
I didn't think you'd understand.

39:33.599 --> 39:35.329
Why don't you try me?

39:35.480 --> 39:37.686
I'm a smart girl, remember?

39:48.440 --> 39:50.920
I'm doing this for us.

39:51.079 --> 39:53.889
- It's our escape plan.
- Escape from what?

39:54.039 --> 39:57.248
I don't know any
old, wrinkled drug dealers.

39:57.400 --> 40:00.005
They're either
dead or inside, Tasha.

40:00.159 --> 40:02.400
That doesn't scare you?

40:02.559 --> 40:04.688
No.

40:04.880 --> 40:07.201
Because they're not you.

40:07.360 --> 40:10.409
They're not as good as you.

40:12.840 --> 40:14.568
This club is the dream.

40:15.679 --> 40:18.922
We can get out.
We can have it all.

40:20.679 --> 40:24.320
We already have it all.

40:25.760 --> 40:28.730
You, me, the kids.

40:28.880 --> 40:32.965
The way things are now,
it is my dream.

40:37.400 --> 40:39.880
I think we got him, boss.
Scott.

40:42.119 --> 40:43.849
I got to go, Tasha.

40:49.719 --> 40:51.005
He fits the physical description,

40:51.159 --> 40:52.605
is preying
on the same type of girl.

40:52.800 --> 40:55.451
Already checked his I.D. swipe.
He was here that night.

40:55.639 --> 40:57.085
No shit.

40:57.239 --> 40:59.048
- Did he sell any product yet?
- Nope.

40:59.199 --> 41:01.123
All right, well, as soon
as he does, we'll grab him.

41:01.280 --> 41:03.282
- All right.
- Hold on.

41:03.480 --> 41:05.641
- What's up?
- The kid talked.

41:05.800 --> 41:07.688
You better get your ass out here.

41:07.840 --> 41:10.684
Yeah.
I got to go, man.

41:10.840 --> 41:11.840
- You got to go?
- I got to go.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.561
- Well, what do you want me to do?
- Holly, I want you keep your eye

41:15.719 --> 41:16.800
on that prick.

41:16.960 --> 41:18.530
Try to get him to sell to you.

41:18.679 --> 41:20.250
I'm on it.

41:21.679 --> 41:23.045
Call me.

41:23.199 --> 41:24.485
Soon as he makes a move,
call me.

41:24.639 --> 41:26.130
Got it.

41:41.039 --> 41:42.643
He wouldn't tell me
who he was working for.

41:42.800 --> 41:45.041
- Now we know.
- Oye.

41:45.199 --> 41:48.248
You wake me up,
drag me out my house, for what?

41:48.440 --> 41:50.521
You hire this motherfucker
to boost my product?

41:50.679 --> 41:52.284
Fuck,no.
I never seen him before.

41:52.440 --> 41:55.125
You told me you didn't know
nothing about us getting hit, Anibal.

41:55.320 --> 41:56.650
You said it to my face.

41:56.800 --> 41:59.201
We're hearing a different story
from crispy beef here.

41:59.360 --> 42:01.088
Turns out you were behind it
the whole fucking time.

42:01.239 --> 42:02.445
Yo, why the fuck
would I do that?

42:02.599 --> 42:04.887
- Yo, Ghost, you know me, man.
- I thought I did.

42:06.119 --> 42:09.043
Yo, you gonna do me like this
on the word of this motherfucker?

42:09.199 --> 42:10.769
Get on your fucking knees.

42:10.960 --> 42:12.485
People have a funny way
of telling the truth

42:12.639 --> 42:14.050
when you light 'em on fire.

42:14.199 --> 42:15.644
Nighty-night, Anibal.

42:17.360 --> 42:20.728
Yo, Ghost, you know that
if I'ma fucking step to you,

42:20.880 --> 42:22.563
I'ma use my best men.

42:22.719 --> 42:25.086
This motherfucker ain't Taino.

42:25.239 --> 42:27.208
Yo, I'm being set up.

42:27.360 --> 42:30.125
Yo, I swear on my kids, man.

42:31.440 --> 42:33.568
We're wasting time.
Do him.

42:33.719 --> 42:36.849
Tommy, if you hire a hitter
to pull off a job like this,

42:37.000 --> 42:38.445
you gotta make sure
it's someone good.

42:38.599 --> 42:40.728
Miguel hid the shit
and then talked, this kid broke.

42:40.880 --> 42:41.880
Yeah, well,
I learn from my mistakes.

42:42.079 --> 42:43.730
Maybe.
Julito, wake him the fuck up

42:43.880 --> 42:44.880
and ask him again
how he got the job.

42:45.079 --> 42:46.730
Hey, hey, hey.
Wake the fuck up.

42:46.880 --> 42:48.119
Hey.

42:48.280 --> 42:50.327
Yo, boss?

42:50.480 --> 42:52.402
Yo, this motherfucker's dead.

42:53.719 --> 42:55.244
I thought I cooked him
medium rare.

42:55.400 --> 42:57.846
Yo, I swear
I didn't do nothing, yo.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.728
- Rolla wants my corners.
- That's fucking bullshit.

42:59.880 --> 43:01.085
Ruiz hates me 'cause
I'm Dominican.

43:01.239 --> 43:03.048
- Shoot this motherfucker!
- I ain't gonna kill a primera

43:03.199 --> 43:06.010
unless I got proof
he's crossed me.

43:06.159 --> 43:09.083
- There's your proof!
- Think, Tommy.

43:09.239 --> 43:11.766
If Anibal's being set up here,
so are we,

43:11.920 --> 43:14.240
to start a fucking war.

43:14.440 --> 43:16.840
I got another plan.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.844
- We shut everything down.
- What?

43:20.000 --> 43:22.286
We have us a meeting.
I sit across the table,

43:22.440 --> 43:24.601
I look all those motherfuckers
in the eye,

43:24.760 --> 43:26.762
and I find out who's hitting me
once and for all.

43:26.920 --> 43:29.240
Until then,
no one gets product.

43:29.400 --> 43:32.130
- Spread the fucking word.
- Ghost.

43:32.280 --> 43:35.204
Ghost, we can't just shut down
the wholesale business.

43:35.360 --> 43:37.010
We can't just let Fat Albert go.

43:37.159 --> 43:39.003
We can do anything we want to do.
We need proof, Tommy.

43:39.159 --> 43:40.764
But if I find out
it was Anibal all along,

43:40.920 --> 43:43.126
I promise you,
I'll cut his throat myself.

43:51.599 --> 43:53.409
You didn't call.

43:53.559 --> 43:57.121
The girl was on him all night.
He never dealt.

43:57.320 --> 43:59.322
Look, if the cops call,
we play nice.

43:59.480 --> 44:03.007
Grabbing the dealer was icing.
It'll all work out.

44:03.199 --> 44:07.204
Good news, we made
upwards of 80K tonight.

44:07.360 --> 44:09.248
Pretty fucking great.

44:25.079 --> 44:26.844
Hey, Holly.
Can I get you a cab?

44:27.000 --> 44:28.684
Yes, please.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.364
You want a ride home?

44:43.519 --> 44:45.443
I just spent nine hours
in 6-inch heels,

44:45.599 --> 44:48.001
so getting down on my knees
ain't gonna happen.

44:48.199 --> 44:49.690
It's not like that, Holly.

44:51.320 --> 44:54.210
You took the trouble
to learn my name.

44:54.360 --> 44:55.804
You impressed?

44:56.000 --> 44:58.206
Nope.

44:58.360 --> 45:01.125
When was the last time
you asked a girl out on a real date?

45:01.280 --> 45:03.362
Do you even know how?

45:05.480 --> 45:08.005
Can I take you to get
some breakfast, Holly?

45:09.920 --> 45:12.047
Good night...

45:12.199 --> 45:14.043
boss.

45:29.840 --> 45:31.922
Mmph.

45:32.119 --> 45:33.884
Bunch of calls went out
late last night.

45:34.079 --> 45:36.242
- Connect called a meeting.
- You got a name for the connect?

45:36.400 --> 45:38.242
- Mm-mm.
- What kind of meeting?

45:38.400 --> 45:40.402
I was inside with a Taino soldier
a few years ago.

45:40.559 --> 45:41.925
He owes me one.

45:42.079 --> 45:44.367
He says your guy, Anibal,
don't know if he called the meeting,

45:44.519 --> 45:46.284
but he's gonna be there for sure.

45:46.440 --> 45:48.521
Are you happy now?

45:48.719 --> 45:50.847
Yes, I'm happy.

45:54.480 --> 45:58.166
I need you to find out when and where
this meeting's gonna be.

45:58.320 --> 46:00.925
Nomar Arcielo confirmed
that Ruiz, Anibal,

46:01.079 --> 46:03.128
and other members
of Lobos' New York network

46:03.320 --> 46:05.288
will be convening
at the distributor's behest.

46:05.440 --> 46:07.806
So Anibal is involved?

46:07.960 --> 46:09.199
We'll know how exactly

46:09.360 --> 46:10.771
when we get the when and where
of the meeting.

46:10.920 --> 46:12.331
My C.I. is on it.

46:12.480 --> 46:15.289
You mean Agent Knox's C.I.

46:16.679 --> 46:18.284
Nomar's been responsive
to Angela,

46:18.440 --> 46:20.487
so she's been
accompanying me on meet-ups,

46:20.639 --> 46:21.846
like the one this morning.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.844
Turns out Nomar
likes the bad cop. Go figure.

46:25.920 --> 46:29.003
We catch the distributor
at this meeting, flip him on Lobos,

46:29.159 --> 46:32.846
nice little package for Collins,
all wrapped up with a bow.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.764
Great work, you two.

46:39.519 --> 46:41.806
Thank you for covering for me.

46:41.960 --> 46:44.327
Nomar knows your real name.

46:44.480 --> 46:46.766
How hard would it be to find out
where you work, where you live?

46:46.920 --> 46:48.206
I have a gun.

46:48.360 --> 46:51.681
Oh, f-- what, you-- you have permission
to have it at the office

46:51.840 --> 46:54.411
or time to use it when he busts
through your front door?

46:56.519 --> 46:58.443
Maybe I should stay
at your place for a while, until--

46:58.599 --> 46:59.681
- I'll be careful.
- Okay.

46:59.840 --> 47:01.443
I promise.

47:03.719 --> 47:07.088
I got to write this report,
so where did we meet Nomar?

47:40.400 --> 47:43.210
So how long
before you have to split?

47:43.360 --> 47:45.123
- I'm good.
- Yeah.

47:45.280 --> 47:47.487
I had a good morning at work,

47:47.639 --> 47:51.724
so I'm rewarding myself
with these fries and with you.

47:51.880 --> 47:53.802
So tell me what happened.

47:53.960 --> 47:55.882
- A play-by-play of my meeting?
- Mm-hmm.

47:56.039 --> 47:58.360
Hmm, you better get
more coffee to stay awake.

47:58.559 --> 48:00.960
That bad, huh?

48:02.239 --> 48:05.050
What about you?
Did you catch that dealer?

48:07.880 --> 48:10.565
Days like yesterday,
Angie, I mean...

48:11.840 --> 48:13.409
Shit.

48:13.559 --> 48:15.960
Makes me wonder
if I'm kidding myself doing all this.

48:16.159 --> 48:18.606
- All what?
- All of it, everything.

48:18.760 --> 48:21.001
All the choices I've made
to get here.

48:21.159 --> 48:24.527
Listen, hmm?

48:25.880 --> 48:28.360
I don't know what's involved
in running a club,

48:28.519 --> 48:31.284
but I know that at my job,
let's just say

48:31.440 --> 48:35.967
one day I'm the hero,
the next day I'm knee-deep in shit.

48:36.119 --> 48:38.440
That's exactly how I feel.

48:38.639 --> 48:41.324
That doesn't mean
I give up, you know?

48:43.199 --> 48:46.646
Some people get everything
handed to them on a platter.

48:46.800 --> 48:49.121
All they have to do
is count their money.

48:49.320 --> 48:51.846
- Mm.
- That's never been me.

48:52.000 --> 48:55.322
No one's ever bought me diamonds
or paid my rent.

48:58.599 --> 49:00.170
I bought myself a bracelet once.

49:00.320 --> 49:02.242
Some guy got one for Paz,

49:02.400 --> 49:04.322
but I couldn't afford
the real version.

49:04.480 --> 49:08.643
Turned my whole arm green.

49:10.159 --> 49:12.731
But I wore it till it fell apart.

49:15.920 --> 49:19.925
I've always done everything
for myself, like you.

49:21.519 --> 49:23.887
We got ourselves where we are.

49:25.119 --> 49:26.963
- It gets lonely.
- Lonely.

49:30.800 --> 49:33.007
Not everybody
understands us, Jamie.

49:34.679 --> 49:37.809
Guess that's why I'm sitting
here right now with you, Angie.

49:41.199 --> 49:43.282
Angie Valdes.

49:46.039 --> 49:48.440
You don't feel lonely
now, do you?

49:49.960 --> 49:52.280
No.

49:53.320 --> 49:55.721
I think maybe this time you did.

49:55.880 --> 49:57.041
No, you did.

49:57.199 --> 50:01.728
Yeah, maybe.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.967
What happens now?

50:07.239 --> 50:08.570
I don't know.

50:10.599 --> 50:12.728
But I'm not
letting you go again.

50:50.039 --> 50:51.451
I'll call you.

50:53.360 --> 50:55.362
You better.

50:55.519 --> 50:57.487
Here, take this.

51:25.679 --> 51:26.965
My pops said hello.

51:27.119 --> 51:30.329
Yeah?
How was it seeing him?

51:30.519 --> 51:32.284
Fine.

51:33.599 --> 51:34.806
Maybe good.

51:35.880 --> 51:37.768
He's been in
since I was nine,

51:37.920 --> 51:40.605
and I always
hated him for it.

51:40.760 --> 51:43.161
But after today,
I feel guilty.

51:43.320 --> 51:47.085
I'm out here on easy street,
doing whatever I wanted.

51:48.079 --> 51:49.684
But now that
I'm working with you,

51:49.840 --> 51:51.922
I see my dad differently.

51:53.800 --> 51:58.010
Sure, maybe he's not perfect,
but he's my father.

52:00.800 --> 52:03.166
I mean, isn't that
what you meant?

52:06.840 --> 52:08.329
You know what?
I need to make a stop.

52:08.519 --> 52:10.521
Head uptown.

52:15.880 --> 52:17.563
You're home early.

52:22.679 --> 52:25.001
You lied to me, Ghost.
These don't make up for shit.

52:25.199 --> 52:27.123
Give 'em back, then.

52:30.960 --> 52:33.360
Yasmine's down for her nap.
Keep an eye on her.

52:42.360 --> 52:43.804
Tasha!

53:00.719 --> 53:02.847
What is it? What is it?

53:03.000 --> 53:04.411
Baby, baby.

53:04.559 --> 53:07.210
Give me.
What is it?

53:07.360 --> 53:09.885
You're okay.

53:10.079 --> 53:11.809
- She's okay, she's okay.
- You're okay, you're okay.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.161
- Hey, it's okay, she's okay.
- You're okay.

53:13.320 --> 53:15.083
What the hell is that
in her mouth?

53:15.239 --> 53:17.083
It's okay. It's okay.

53:17.239 --> 53:18.730
It's okay.

53:18.920 --> 53:21.684
It's okay, baby.
It's okay. It's okay.

53:21.880 --> 53:23.847
It's okay.
It's all right.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.206
Oh, my God. It's all right.

53:33.760 --> 53:35.762
You Angela Valdes?

53:38.440 --> 53:40.090
Sign here, please.

54:44.239 --> 54:45.969
My God.
Oh, my...

54:48.320 --> 54:50.003
Shh.

54:50.159 --> 54:52.969
We're fine.
I got you.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.001
I'm here.
