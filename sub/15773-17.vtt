00:00.083 --> 00:03.268
So, uh, did you have ****
how Speedy got his pizza place?

00:03.393 --> 00:05.368
- Not really.
- I wasn't talking to you.

00:05.716 --> 00:09.228
Well, it all started
at a baseball game.

00:09.353 --> 00:12.321
- Then who are you talking to?
- Just watch.

00:12.389 --> 00:15.257
[Cheering and applause]

00:15.325 --> 00:16.892
Strike one!

00:16.960 --> 00:19.355
Oho! You choked!

00:19.422 --> 00:21.732
You're the world's worst!

00:23.006 --> 00:24.869
I'd watch it if I were you.

00:24.937 --> 00:26.772
What? They love it!

00:26.840 --> 00:30.540
Hey, Rodriguez!
You have a stupid face!

00:30.607 --> 00:32.173
Strike two!

00:32.241 --> 00:34.141
Break out the aloe vera--

00:34.208 --> 00:37.041
this guy just got burned.

00:37.109 --> 00:38.910
[Stammering]
Daffy, come on.

00:40.516 --> 00:43.088
I bet you're a terrible
husband and father.

00:43.155 --> 00:44.258
[Ball whizzes and hits glove]

00:44.326 --> 00:46.430

01:24.980 --> 01:26.915
Which hospital are we going to?

01:26.983 --> 01:28.217
We're not going to a hospital

01:28.285 --> 01:30.319
we're going to Girardi's
for pizza.

01:30.387 --> 01:32.155
But what if I have
a concussion?

01:32.223 --> 01:33.556
You know what they say--

01:33.624 --> 01:35.725
starve a cold,
feed a head injury.

01:35.793 --> 01:38.661
[Stammering] Besides,
we go to Girardi's every Sunday.

01:38.729 --> 01:40.396
It's tradition.

01:42.432 --> 01:43.867
Closed?

01:43.935 --> 01:47.304
Ahh. If it isn't
my favorite customers,

01:47.371 --> 01:50.941
Bugs, Porky, and, uh, this guy.

01:51.009 --> 01:54.311
I'm so glad I got to see you
before we left.

01:54.379 --> 01:55.479
Where you going?

01:55.546 --> 01:56.880
Back to Italy.

01:56.948 --> 02:00.083
Mrs. Girardi and I,
we made out a fortune.

02:00.150 --> 02:01.451
It's time to retire.

02:01.518 --> 02:03.520
Aw, that's nice.

02:03.588 --> 02:07.726
Nice? It's terrible!
We love this place.

02:07.793 --> 02:10.161
Aww, isn't that sweet.

02:14.933 --> 02:18.269
Arrivederci, Porky.

02:18.337 --> 02:20.472
See you later, buddy.

02:23.944 --> 02:25.945
Mwah.

02:30.218 --> 02:32.453
Now what are we going to do?

02:34.790 --> 02:36.825
It's no Girardi's.

02:36.893 --> 02:39.028
You're too sentimental.

02:39.095 --> 02:41.730
Mmm. This stuff's delicious.

02:41.798 --> 02:43.967
Here's some more pork ribs.

02:44.035 --> 02:46.637
You know, I find that
highly offensive.

02:46.704 --> 02:48.906
Why? You eat pepperoni pizza.

02:48.974 --> 02:51.376
- So?
- Pepperoni?

02:51.444 --> 02:52.778
Uh, what?

02:52.845 --> 02:55.948
Mmm.
[Grunts]

02:56.016 --> 02:57.883
We need our old hangout back.

02:57.951 --> 03:00.553
But Mr. Girardi's selling
the restaurant.

03:00.621 --> 03:02.054
Then I'll buy it.

03:02.122 --> 03:03.890
[Spits]
That's brilliant!

03:03.957 --> 03:06.192
I've always wanted
to own a restaurant.

03:06.259 --> 03:08.461
You wouldn't own it.
I would.

03:08.529 --> 03:09.963
Hmm.

03:10.030 --> 03:11.064
You could work there.

03:11.131 --> 03:13.733
[Scoffs]
I don't do menial labor.

03:13.801 --> 03:17.069
No, of course not.
I was thinking you would be

03:17.137 --> 03:19.872
commander-in-chief
of pizza operations.

03:19.940 --> 03:23.342
Commander-in-chief
of pizza operations.

03:23.410 --> 03:26.713
I'll require a uniform
with plenty of medals.

03:26.781 --> 03:28.549
Bugs, as your friend,

03:28.616 --> 03:31.886
I think buying Girardi's is
a great idea.

03:31.954 --> 03:35.490
Then it's settled.
I'm buying Girardi's pizza.

03:35.558 --> 03:38.027
But as your financial advisor,

03:38.094 --> 03:42.432
I must warn you that 9 out
of 10 restaurants fail in the first year.

03:42.499 --> 03:45.234
You want to keep coming here
on Sunday nights?

03:45.302 --> 03:47.270
Here's your pulled pork
sandwich.

03:47.338 --> 03:49.639
- Mmm.
- Buy the restaurant.

03:52.643 --> 03:54.712
[Bell jangles]

03:54.779 --> 03:57.715
I'm here to apply for the job.

03:57.782 --> 04:01.718
Oh, great.
Take a seat.

04:01.786 --> 04:03.220
No. I mean sit down.

04:03.288 --> 04:05.456
Oh, right.

04:08.259 --> 04:10.461
Do you have
any waiting experience?

04:10.528 --> 04:13.997
I wait for the bus every day.

04:14.065 --> 04:15.532
Have you ever waited tables?

04:15.600 --> 04:18.601
Why would I wait for a table?

04:18.670 --> 04:20.870
We're asking
the questions here.

04:20.939 --> 04:22.840
Why do you want this job?

04:22.907 --> 04:25.843
- I like pizza.
- That's not good enough.

04:25.911 --> 04:28.413
When you're in the weeds,
and the pizzas are flying,

04:28.481 --> 04:29.915
and you're covered
in tomato sauce,

04:29.982 --> 04:32.551
and you don't know if it's yours
or your buddy's,

04:32.618 --> 04:34.486
"I like pizza" will not cut it.

04:34.554 --> 04:37.257
"I like pizza"
just might get you killed.

04:37.325 --> 04:38.758
Any questions?

04:38.826 --> 04:41.961
I thought you were asking
the questions.

04:43.297 --> 04:47.433
Son, I like your moxie.
When can you start?

04:50.070 --> 04:53.740
I'm dependable, hardworking,
and a team player.

04:53.807 --> 04:55.608
How would you handle a robbery?

04:56.643 --> 04:58.978
- Pardon?
- Hypothetically.

05:03.517 --> 05:05.651
You're working late, alone.

05:05.719 --> 05:08.488
Suddenly, a masked intruder
bursts in the door and shouts,

05:08.556 --> 05:10.524
"this is a robbery."
What do you do?

05:10.591 --> 05:14.194
Let's just say
I would handle the problem.

05:14.262 --> 05:18.131
Excuse me.
I'm about to get a phone call.

05:24.772 --> 05:26.606
[Bell dings]

05:28.442 --> 05:32.112
Well, your resume seems fine,
but I don't see any references.

05:32.179 --> 05:34.147
This is a robbery.

05:36.717 --> 05:38.952
You're hired.
[Sizzling]

05:42.391 --> 05:45.026
Where's all the mozzarella?

05:45.093 --> 05:48.629
Oh, sorry, Speedy,
I used it all. I'm making pizza.

05:48.697 --> 05:50.331
Ever heard of delivery?

05:50.399 --> 05:52.567
I'm practicing.
I bought Girardi's.

05:52.635 --> 05:55.638
You bought a restaurant?
Why, because it's your dream?

05:55.705 --> 05:58.307
Because you want to be able
to make something with your own two hands

05:58.375 --> 06:00.377
that gives so much pleasure
to so many?

06:00.444 --> 06:05.648
Or because you want to be
surrounded by all this cheese?

06:05.716 --> 06:08.485
No, because I want a place
to hang out on Sunday nights.

06:08.553 --> 06:09.753
Hang out?

06:09.821 --> 06:12.489
You want a place to hang out,
convert your garage.

06:12.557 --> 06:15.193
Don't buy a restaurant.

06:15.261 --> 06:17.095
Have you ever owned
a restaurant?

06:17.163 --> 06:19.330
- Nope.
- But you worked in a restaurant.

06:19.398 --> 06:20.931
- Never.
- Well, surely,

06:20.999 --> 06:23.100
you've done a lot of research
about being a restaurateur.

06:23.168 --> 06:25.202
Uh, not really.

06:25.270 --> 06:27.437
Well, don't worry.
You'll be ok,

06:27.505 --> 06:30.339
as long as you have
a capable staff.

06:30.407 --> 06:32.408
Which eye patch
do you like better,

06:32.476 --> 06:34.043
this one?

06:34.110 --> 06:35.911
Or this one?

06:35.979 --> 06:38.713
Or both of them?
Oof! [Crashes]

06:38.781 --> 06:40.915
Hope you got a backup plan.

06:45.596 --> 06:47.697
We open the doors in 5 minutes.

06:47.765 --> 06:49.332
Porky will be cashier,

06:49.400 --> 06:52.069
you and I will be out front
dealing with the customers,

06:52.137 --> 06:55.005
and you two will be back here
making pizza.

06:55.073 --> 06:57.342
Any questions?
How do you make pizza?

06:57.409 --> 06:59.343
[Sighs]

07:00.945 --> 07:04.648
You just roll the dough...

07:04.716 --> 07:08.218
Toss the dough...

07:08.285 --> 07:09.819
Spread the sauce,

07:09.886 --> 07:12.888
sprinkle the cheese, and voila.

07:12.956 --> 07:15.724
Got all that?
Huh?

07:15.792 --> 07:18.893
Oh, sorry. I was writing down a dream
I had last night.

07:18.961 --> 07:21.129
You were in it.
You were in it.

07:21.197 --> 07:22.963
You were not in it.

07:25.134 --> 07:27.569
You were in it,
but when you talked,

07:27.636 --> 07:29.471
you had a woman's voice.

07:29.538 --> 07:33.174
Ooh! Did I sound pretty?

07:34.776 --> 07:36.611
What do you think you're doing?

07:36.679 --> 07:38.480
Making pizza.

07:38.547 --> 07:41.883
Not anymore. I outrank you.
Step aside.

07:45.521 --> 07:46.955
Ooh!

07:47.022 --> 07:48.890
May I take your order?

07:48.958 --> 07:50.325
Yeah.
We'll have a large pizza,

07:50.393 --> 07:52.126
half mushroom, half pepperoni.

07:52.194 --> 07:54.362
And on the mushroom half,
can we get extra sauce?

07:54.430 --> 07:57.799
And on the pepperoni half,
can we go light on the cheese?

07:57.867 --> 07:59.133
You got it.

07:59.201 --> 08:02.404
Do you need to write
any of this down?

08:02.472 --> 08:06.140
It's all up here.

08:07.877 --> 08:10.845
- What's the order?
- I think "pizza."

08:16.352 --> 08:17.352
[Dings]

08:17.420 --> 08:19.054
Table 4 still hasn't
gotten their pizza.

08:19.122 --> 08:21.890
What's going on back here?
We're out of pizza dough.

08:21.958 --> 08:23.559
- What?
- Where is my pizza?

08:23.626 --> 08:25.794
You asked for cheese,
I brought you cheese.

08:25.862 --> 08:28.664
- What do we do?
- We improvise!

08:28.732 --> 08:31.400
Cut those cardboard boxes
into the shape of pizzas!

08:31.468 --> 08:33.936
I deserve another medal
for this.

08:34.004 --> 08:36.339
[Both talk at once]

08:36.405 --> 08:38.341
What seems to be the problem?

08:38.409 --> 08:40.009
I ordered a cheese pizza,

08:40.077 --> 08:42.712
and he gave me a cup of cheese
and an I.O.U.

08:42.780 --> 08:44.714
We're having some problems
with the crust.

08:44.782 --> 08:46.416
I'll take care of it.
[Register dings]

08:46.484 --> 08:48.419
Ooh! I like the sound of that.

08:48.486 --> 08:49.687
Here's your refund.

08:49.755 --> 08:51.656
Oh. Don't like
the sound of that.

08:51.724 --> 08:54.092
Why didn't you tell me
that cardboard was flammable?

08:54.160 --> 08:56.495
You're drunk with power.

08:56.562 --> 08:58.464
[Gasps]

09:04.238 --> 09:05.838
Excuse me.

09:05.906 --> 09:09.042
I said, excuse me.

09:09.109 --> 09:11.744
I know. The pizza's awful.
I'll take care of it.

09:11.812 --> 09:14.681
I was just going to ask
for a napkin.

09:14.749 --> 09:17.217
But the pizza is terrible.

09:17.284 --> 09:20.620
Insubordination!

09:20.688 --> 09:21.888
[Both scream]

09:21.955 --> 09:23.322
[Grunts]

09:23.390 --> 09:25.758
I gave you a direct order!

09:25.825 --> 09:27.993
You're not fit to lead!

09:28.061 --> 09:29.360
[Both grunt]

09:32.131 --> 09:34.198
He started it!

09:34.266 --> 09:37.267
Are you all done
with your pizza?

09:37.335 --> 09:39.102
We never got our pizza.

09:39.170 --> 09:43.274
Thanks for coming!
Tell your friends.

09:43.341 --> 09:46.144
Ok. Who's up for Chinese?
All: I am!

09:46.211 --> 09:50.548
Hunan palace, hunan palace,
hunan palace.

09:55.487 --> 09:59.024
Party of 3?
Right this way.

09:59.092 --> 10:00.893
[Groans]

10:04.598 --> 10:06.733
Do you want the good news
or the bad news?

10:06.800 --> 10:08.268
Give me the bad news.

10:08.336 --> 10:10.170
The restaurant's a disaster.

10:10.238 --> 10:12.372
At this rate,
you'll be broke in a week.

10:12.440 --> 10:13.740
What's the good news?

10:13.808 --> 10:17.278
Hunan palace sent you
a gift basket.

10:17.345 --> 10:20.814
Ooh! Real Italian pepperoni.

10:20.882 --> 10:23.250
[Grunting]

10:25.820 --> 10:27.321
What?

10:45.839 --> 10:51.345
? Behold the wizard ?

10:51.412 --> 10:57.919
? beware his powers ?

10:57.987 --> 11:03.725
? unspeakable powers ?

11:03.793 --> 11:06.862
? under the gaze
of the necromancer ?

11:06.930 --> 11:10.800
? a silver staircase
starts to rise ?

11:10.868 --> 11:13.336
? people stand on it
and marvel ?

11:13.404 --> 11:17.341
? at the power shooting
from his eyes ?

11:17.408 --> 11:20.744
? cold food becomes ?

11:20.812 --> 11:24.080
? hot again ?

11:24.148 --> 11:31.055
? when his spell unfolds ?

11:31.123 --> 11:37.494
? with a mere wave
of his hand ?

11:37.562 --> 11:45.102
? this hot dog will explode ?

11:45.169 --> 11:48.138
? in the presence
of the wizard ?

11:48.206 --> 11:51.542
? traffic will stop
at his whim ?

11:51.609 --> 11:54.578
? he can cross the street
no problem ?

11:54.646 --> 11:58.482
? as the cars bow down
in front of him ?

11:58.550 --> 12:05.222
? channels on the tv change ?

12:05.290 --> 12:11.595
? he's still in his chair ?

12:11.663 --> 12:18.635
? then he pulls
his magic wand ?

12:18.703 --> 12:26.208
? and reclines in the air ?

12:30.580 --> 12:33.815
By the dim light
of the dream realm's black sun,

12:33.882 --> 12:37.485
the wizard climbs
the frozen waterfall of voldrini

12:37.552 --> 12:39.520
in search of celestia,

12:39.588 --> 12:43.357
the guardian
of infinite power...

12:43.425 --> 12:46.460
When suddenly,
a terrible garlon appears

12:46.528 --> 12:48.428
and attacks with ice!

12:48.496 --> 12:52.699
But the wizard is undeterred.

12:52.767 --> 12:56.470
The garlon roars and unleashes
a most sinister wind.

12:56.537 --> 12:59.239
But the wizard is undeterred.

12:59.306 --> 13:03.376
The garlon summons
the stones of prophynia,

13:03.444 --> 13:06.912
but the wizard is undeterred.

13:08.281 --> 13:12.217
Calling upon the powers
of the ancients,

13:12.284 --> 13:14.719
the wizard conjures
a sacred fire

13:14.787 --> 13:18.656
and casts his foe
into the molten maw

13:18.723 --> 13:21.659
of an insatiable gort.

13:21.726 --> 13:22.994
Thanks, gort.

13:23.062 --> 13:26.898
Ahh, celestia.

13:27.900 --> 13:32.172
I think you're going
to enjoy this.

13:32.239 --> 13:35.976
The wizard stands on
the precipice of ultimate power.

13:36.043 --> 13:38.612
The gates open to reveal...

13:40.447 --> 13:43.716
Ooh! How long was I asleep?

13:43.784 --> 13:46.551
3 days.
You have a bed, you know.

13:46.619 --> 13:50.221
I'm starving.
I got to get something to eat.

13:50.289 --> 13:56.893
? Famished from
his latest quest ?

13:56.961 --> 14:04.134
? the wizard seeks a snack ?

14:04.201 --> 14:10.173
? he sets sail for ecstasy ?

14:10.241 --> 14:16.846
? at the quesadilla shack ?

14:16.914 --> 14:20.216
? he is the wizard ?

14:20.284 --> 14:24.956
? the mystical wizard ?

14:28.325 --> 14:29.387
What was I thinking?

14:29.512 --> 14:31.068
I don't know
how to run a restaurant.

14:31.193 --> 14:33.247
Girardi's needs
a miracle, fast.

14:42.435 --> 14:44.603
Hey, Speedy?
Que Paso?

14:44.670 --> 14:47.271
I have a favor to ask you.

14:47.339 --> 14:49.440
Yesterday was a little shaky.

14:49.508 --> 14:52.543
We lost a lot of customers,
and we lost a lot of morale.

14:52.611 --> 14:54.778
But we're going
to turn it around today.

14:54.846 --> 14:55.846
Yeah!

14:55.914 --> 14:58.382
Because we're not in
the loser business--

14:58.450 --> 15:00.484
we're in the pizza business.

15:00.552 --> 15:01.685
- Oh, yeah!
- Pizza!

15:01.753 --> 15:03.620
And like pizza dough,

15:03.688 --> 15:05.789
we'll rise to the occasion.

15:05.857 --> 15:07.157
[All cheer]

15:07.225 --> 15:08.659
We're going to work fast.

15:08.727 --> 15:10.027
We're going to work smart.

15:10.095 --> 15:12.563
And we're going to put
each of you in a position

15:12.631 --> 15:15.734
where it will be impossible
for you to fail.

15:15.801 --> 15:18.470
Now, who's with me?
We are!

15:18.538 --> 15:22.174
Then get in this pantry!

15:23.710 --> 15:25.512
What are we supposed
to do in here?

15:25.580 --> 15:27.447
You're doing it!

15:29.717 --> 15:31.951
I think that went pretty well.

15:32.019 --> 15:36.088
Welcome to Girardi's.
May I take your order?

15:36.156 --> 15:39.457
There's so many choices.
What would you recommend?

15:39.525 --> 15:42.160
You?
You look feisty,

15:42.227 --> 15:44.528
like a beautiful tiger
waiting to pounce.

15:44.596 --> 15:47.198
You need a cheese with some bite.
Ooh?

15:47.265 --> 15:49.634
Asagio.

15:49.701 --> 15:51.469
And you,

15:51.537 --> 15:54.238
you have a wisdom about you,
a wisdom that whispers,

15:54.306 --> 15:56.840
"mushrooms."

15:56.908 --> 15:59.143
Enjoy.

16:56.735 --> 16:58.736
[Indistinct talking]

17:19.093 --> 17:21.627
Turns out the secret
to a successful restaurant--

17:21.695 --> 17:23.964
a mouse.

17:24.031 --> 17:25.965
Tell that
to the health department.

17:26.034 --> 17:27.935
[Laughs]

17:29.303 --> 17:31.237
Hello?
[Bell dings and door shuts]

17:31.305 --> 17:32.906
[Lock clicks] Hello?

17:32.973 --> 17:36.408
Hello? Hello?

17:36.476 --> 17:39.511
[Stammering] Want the good
news or the bad news?

17:39.579 --> 17:42.281
- The good news.
- Girardi's pizza is a hit.

17:42.348 --> 17:44.516
Looks like you're going
to be busy running a restaurant

17:44.584 --> 17:46.818
for years to come.

17:46.886 --> 17:48.619
What's the matter?

17:48.687 --> 17:51.456
I didn't want to be busy
owning a restaurant.

17:51.524 --> 17:53.625
I didn't want to be busy
doing anything.

17:53.692 --> 17:55.660
I just wanted a place
to hang out.

17:55.728 --> 17:58.863
So what's the bad news?

17:58.931 --> 18:01.966
This whole time
I've been eating pepperoni,

18:02.034 --> 18:04.502
I've been eating me!

18:08.707 --> 18:10.642
[Sobs]

18:10.709 --> 18:12.877
[Grunting]

18:15.381 --> 18:16.848
- Speedy.
- Ai!

18:16.915 --> 18:19.350
You know, there's such a thing
as knocking.

18:19.418 --> 18:22.019
Come on.
I want to show you something.

18:22.087 --> 18:23.621
What are we doing here?

18:23.688 --> 18:26.891
Remember when you asked if it was
my dream to own a restaurant?

18:26.959 --> 18:28.893
- Yes.
- Well, it's not.

18:28.961 --> 18:32.030
But I had a hunch
it might be yours.

18:32.098 --> 18:34.567
Pizzarriba!

18:34.634 --> 18:37.637
Señor Bunny!
I don't know what to say.

18:37.705 --> 18:41.308
Just say you'll hold
a table for us on Sunday nights.

19:28.288 --> 19:30.290
[Hissing]

19:48.309 --> 19:51.044
[Hissing]

20:03.592 --> 20:05.226
[Wind howls] [Air hisses]

20:19.108 --> 20:21.576
[Bell dinging]

20:30.186 --> 20:32.253
[Squealing]

20:37.960 --> 20:39.627
[Wind howling]

21:17.463 --> 21:19.564
[Indistinct talking]

21:19.632 --> 21:21.466
Now, this is more like it.

21:21.533 --> 21:25.369
Hanging out at Girardi's--
I mean pizzarriba.

21:25.437 --> 21:27.672
Carrot for you.

21:27.739 --> 21:31.276
And plain cheese for you.

21:31.344 --> 21:33.946
[Stammering]
It's not easy being a pig.

21:34.014 --> 21:35.515
[Chews]

21:35.582 --> 21:37.016
Where's Daffy?

21:37.084 --> 21:39.086
Speedy put him in charge
of deliveries.

21:39.153 --> 21:42.122
[Rumbling]

21:42.190 --> 21:43.757
What's the address?

21:43.825 --> 21:45.927
816 beach street.

21:45.995 --> 21:49.030
[Whirring and beeping]

21:49.098 --> 21:52.600
- What's the order?
- One large pepperoni pizza.

21:54.103 --> 21:56.804
Deliver the pizza.

21:56.872 --> 21:58.906
[Screams]

21:58.974 --> 22:00.608
Roll out!
