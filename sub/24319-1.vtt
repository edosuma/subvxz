00:29.906 --> 00:35.453
Richard Nixon: And so let us
start a long march... together.

00:37.830 --> 00:39.206
Not in lockstep

00:40.792 --> 00:42.334
but on different roads

00:42.877 --> 00:44.462
leading to the same goal.

00:48.257 --> 00:51.469
The goal of building
a world structure

00:52.428 --> 00:54.138
of peace and justice,

00:55.848 --> 01:00.060
in which all may stand together
with equal dignity.

01:00.853 --> 01:02.104
Bill Clinton: First of all,

01:02.229 --> 01:04.230
our markets are already open
to China.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.901
This agreement
will open China's market to us.

01:07.359 --> 01:08.861
George W. Bush: I would call
our relationship with China

01:09.028 --> 01:12.448
very positive... and complex.

01:14.533 --> 01:16.368
Barack Obama: The free market
is the greatest force

01:16.494 --> 01:18.496
for economic progress
in human history.

01:19.538 --> 01:21.040
Donald Trump:
I will make a great deal

01:21.206 --> 01:23.250
and lots of great deals
for the American people.

01:23.668 --> 01:25.169
  Believe me!

01:41.894 --> 01:43.395
Dan: What is capitalism?

01:48.108 --> 01:50.486
Is it an economic system?

01:53.823 --> 01:57.242
Or is it an apparatus
that we can use

01:57.409 --> 01:59.495
to make more money
for ourselves

01:59.662 --> 02:01.121
and take more money
from others?

02:03.833 --> 02:05.417
I think, at its heart,

02:06.085 --> 02:08.586
it rewards those who work hard,

02:09.213 --> 02:11.423
but it also rewards
those who...

02:12.132 --> 02:16.261
are willing to...
take advantage of others.

02:28.024 --> 02:31.694
There are no good guys
in this story...

02:33.696 --> 02:34.864
including me.

02:50.254 --> 02:51.630
Yeah, yeah, that's good.
Okay...

02:53.091 --> 02:54.675
Man: What's your earliest memory
from childhood?

02:57.428 --> 03:00.222
That's a trick question.
Man: Is it?

03:00.973 --> 03:03.308
I... was not expecting it.

03:04.226 --> 03:06.979
I don't know what my earliest
memory from childhood was.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.774
I imagine I was two years old
and I was busting

03:09.899 --> 03:10.983
a fraud somewhere.

03:12.276 --> 03:13.778
Narrator: This is Dan David.

03:19.075 --> 03:21.285
The first time I met him,
we had a couple of drinks

03:21.452 --> 03:23.704
at a TGI Fridays
in Penn Station,

03:24.204 --> 03:27.041
and he told me
an almost unbelievable story.

03:31.087 --> 03:32.130
Before the dust had settled

03:32.296 --> 03:34.882
on the economic collapse
of 2008,

03:35.507 --> 03:37.509
Wall Street had already
figured out a new way

03:37.676 --> 03:39.303
to package garbage as gold.

03:40.387 --> 03:41.806
They were engineering
an enormous fraud

03:41.973 --> 03:43.057
that spanned the globe.

03:44.308 --> 03:46.185
But this time,
the lies at the center

03:46.351 --> 03:48.353
of the scam were
100 percent legal.

03:49.521 --> 03:52.524
This time,
the crime was based in China.

03:57.947 --> 03:59.782
Narrator: Dan's part
of the story begins here,

04:00.199 --> 04:01.617
far from Wall Street.

04:03.619 --> 04:05.997
The small investment shop
he ran with his partner Maj

04:06.246 --> 04:08.499
had just been crushed
by the stock market crash.

04:08.833 --> 04:10.126
Three o'clock. What's goin'on?

04:10.292 --> 04:12.252
Dan: People who had hedge funds
in 2008

04:12.419 --> 04:14.797
closed their funds
and started a new fund.

04:15.047 --> 04:16.798
Chris, you got anything?
Finishing working on

04:16.966 --> 04:18.425
what I'm working on now.
I'm just gonna...

04:18.591 --> 04:20.469
We decided right away
we weren't gonna do that.

04:21.012 --> 04:22.638
We were gonna make everybody
their money back.

04:23.555 --> 04:25.516
Narrator: They needed big gains,
quickly.

04:26.184 --> 04:27.226
But with the whole
Western world

04:27.392 --> 04:28.894
on the brink
of another depression,

04:29.353 --> 04:30.771
prospects seemed bleak.

04:36.068 --> 04:37.653
Narrator: It wasn't hopeless
everywhere, though.

04:38.278 --> 04:41.032
The people in the know
steered Dan to China.

04:41.907 --> 04:43.826
It was this exploding market.

04:45.995 --> 04:47.329
Soren: It was the only market
that people actually

04:47.454 --> 04:49.207
were confident
would go up, was China.

04:50.499 --> 04:52.126
Mitch: This is gonna be
the largest economy
in the world.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.585
Let's invest in it now.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.547
It blew my mind 'cause
it was so completely different

04:56.714 --> 04:58.423
from what I thought
it would be it was booming.

04:59.508 --> 05:01.677
Crocker: There were certain
cities, you'd go one time,

05:01.844 --> 05:03.804
and you'd go a year later
again, and suddenly there'd be

05:03.971 --> 05:06.348
a whole new shopping district
that didn't exist last time.

05:10.394 --> 05:11.311
Gold rush.

05:13.564 --> 05:16.441
There was almost no company
that you could invest in

05:16.901 --> 05:20.279
in 2009 that was China-based
that you would lose money on.

05:21.239 --> 05:23.282
Roddy: For an American
set of eyes looking at this,

05:23.448 --> 05:25.034
you were just like,
"Well, my gosh,

05:25.201 --> 05:27.452
"China really is
this golden land

05:27.619 --> 05:29.496
of rapid economic growth."

05:29.663 --> 05:31.456
I really thought,
"Well, jeez, you know,

05:31.623 --> 05:32.917
"the American century
is over now.

05:33.084 --> 05:34.252
This is it."

05:34.418 --> 05:37.379
[seagulls screeching,
waves crashing]

05:40.674 --> 05:42.467
Narrator: Everyone wanted
a piece of China.

05:43.219 --> 05:44.595
There was just one problem,

05:45.470 --> 05:47.556
foreigners like Dan
couldn't invest directly

05:47.723 --> 05:48.766
in Chinese markets.

05:50.059 --> 05:51.810
That's where the small
California bank

05:52.103 --> 05:53.104
Roth Capital came in.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.273
[indistinct chatter,
phone ringing]

05:55.689 --> 05:57.066
Narrator: Roth found a niche
that the big banks

05:57.233 --> 06:00.027
had overlooked,
taking small Chinese companies

06:00.194 --> 06:02.821
and listing them directly
on U.S. stock exchanges.

06:04.156 --> 06:06.700
Now Dan and others like him
could participate

06:06.867 --> 06:08.410
in the Chinese
economic miracle,

06:08.994 --> 06:10.579
and the bank's
young salesmen had the chance

06:10.746 --> 06:12.497
to make a killing
with the right pitch.

06:13.165 --> 06:14.374
Hey, Jed,
how are you doing today?

06:15.084 --> 06:16.127
Great, what do you got?

06:16.543 --> 06:18.378
Well, we're working
on this new company.

06:18.587 --> 06:20.172
Would you like to hear
about a transaction?

06:20.714 --> 06:22.382
Two days go by. Five days go by.

06:22.507 --> 06:23.759
Do you have
any interest in this?

06:23.926 --> 06:25.636
This is what we feel
the company's capacity

06:25.803 --> 06:27.054
can go to
after this acquisition.

06:27.221 --> 06:28.889
These are fully registered
securities.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.057
What do you want to do?

06:30.266 --> 06:31.850
If they did have interest,

06:32.101 --> 06:32.977
they would come back to you.

06:33.102 --> 06:34.312
Yes. Yes.

06:34.561 --> 06:35.729
Yeah, I'm interested.

06:35.896 --> 06:36.897
$2 million worth.

06:37.064 --> 06:37.898
Put me in for that.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.024
Okay, great.

06:39.191 --> 06:40.318
And that would be it.

06:40.484 --> 06:43.779
I tried to make myself
be in the flow.

06:43.946 --> 06:45.281
Think of a running river.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.617
21 million bucks?
That's a pretty good fee.

06:48.826 --> 06:50.577
So let's say this is--
Man: I'm worried, though.

06:50.786 --> 06:53.038
I'm worried that the numbers
don't hold up from China.

06:54.290 --> 06:56.208
Well, I never got asked that.

06:56.375 --> 06:58.794
No one ever asked that.

07:02.673 --> 07:05.384
Roth is a second, third-tier

07:05.717 --> 07:07.761
boutique investment bank
from California.

07:08.637 --> 07:10.430
Someone else had described it
as a frat house.

07:13.309 --> 07:16.020
Herb: Roth Capital would
get behind small companies

07:16.228 --> 07:17.771
and push them out
into the market.

07:18.897 --> 07:22.943
They definitely
were heating up 2010, 2011.

07:23.610 --> 07:26.738
Dan: Roth was well known
for doing China deals

07:26.905 --> 07:28.448
at a time
when we were looking.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.952
We went to a couple
of Roth conferences.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.078
It was a good time.

07:35.664 --> 07:38.167
Woman: Roth Capital Partners
has been organizing conferences

07:38.334 --> 07:40.169
for years in Orange County,
California.

07:40.336 --> 07:42.754
This has got to be
the best conference in America.

07:43.005 --> 07:45.507
Company after company you
may have never heard of before

07:45.674 --> 07:47.634
makes pitches
to people with money.

07:50.554 --> 07:53.015
And their business model
was kind of simplicity itself.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.601
Roddy: They'd have
a three-day extravaganza--

07:56.768 --> 07:59.938
100, 150 companies--
and these CEOs would be saying,

08:00.105 --> 08:02.607
"For these six or seven
or eight or ten reasons,

08:02.774 --> 08:06.153
we think we're gonna
grow revenues 75 percent
next year."

08:06.737 --> 08:08.155
Dan: China has gone,
in the last few years,

08:08.322 --> 08:09.698
from interesting to important.

08:09.865 --> 08:12.076
And then it turns
into entertainment time.

08:14.286 --> 08:16.872
Matt: Snoop Dogg, Billy Idol,
dancers,

08:17.373 --> 08:19.458
ice sculptures,
Trojan theme night, buses,

08:19.624 --> 08:22.461
trains, planes--
and then baijiu,

08:22.669 --> 08:24.629
which looks like motor oil
in a can.

08:24.796 --> 08:25.756
You drank and you drank.

08:28.092 --> 08:30.428
You ganbei,
you cheers to somebody,

08:30.635 --> 08:32.221
and then they have
to cheers to somebody else,

08:32.388 --> 08:33.638
and it goes on and on and on.

08:33.847 --> 08:34.932
The Chinese wanted to see

08:35.099 --> 08:36.433
what kind of a person
you were,

08:36.892 --> 08:39.644
and some of them felt like
the more drunk you got,

08:39.811 --> 08:42.856
the more of your natural persona
would come out.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.527
Narrator:
The master of ceremonies

08:47.694 --> 08:49.780
at these conferences
was often the bank's

08:49.947 --> 08:52.699
stage-diving chairman,
Byron Roth.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.911
? I wanna rock and roll
All night?

08:56.078 --> 08:57.413
Performer: Get him up!

08:57.579 --> 08:59.748
? And party every day,
I wanna rock and roll?

08:59.873 --> 09:01.541
Roddy: You know, this is a guy
who started out

09:01.666 --> 09:04.044
in the commodities business
when he was 16 years old.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.338
His dad
had a feedlot business,

09:06.505 --> 09:08.590
and they'd bid on cows at
auctions and stuff like that.

09:08.757 --> 09:10.717
I mean, this is not
an unsophisticated man.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.304
We just do things that are--
that are different.

09:13.553 --> 09:14.721
And that's kind of
the way we are

09:14.888 --> 09:15.931
as an investment banking firm.

09:17.808 --> 09:19.935
Narrator: For Byron Roth
and Matt and Dan,

09:20.102 --> 09:21.353
it was time to party.

09:22.313 --> 09:26.317
Between 2006 and 2011,
Roth hosted over a dozen

09:26.442 --> 09:29.320
conferences and raised
billions for Chinese companies.

09:29.528 --> 09:31.447
Performer:

09:35.575 --> 09:39.579
Performer: Whoo!

09:45.419 --> 09:46.711
Narrator:
Roth wasn't the only bank

09:46.878 --> 09:48.297
cashing in on the China boom.

09:49.340 --> 09:50.799
In New York, a small operator

09:50.966 --> 09:53.552
named Rodman & Renshaw
ran investment conferences

09:53.718 --> 09:55.095
with a slightly different feel,

09:55.762 --> 09:57.097
centered
on the political star power

09:57.264 --> 09:59.599
of its chairman,
General Wesley Clark.

10:01.226 --> 10:03.145
Male Announcer: In the Balkans,
he helped negotiate a peace

10:03.312 --> 10:04.604
between bitter enemies

10:05.439 --> 10:06.898
and led a multinational force

10:07.065 --> 10:09.109
that stopped
a campaign of terror.

10:09.276 --> 10:12.112
Wes Clark's life is simply
an American story,

10:12.571 --> 10:13.738
but he will make

10:13.905 --> 10:15.949
an extraordinary
American president.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.621
Man: First I want to ask you
to just tell us who you are,

10:21.788 --> 10:23.290
and tell me a bit
about your background.

10:23.457 --> 10:25.000
Yeah, I'm retired general
Wes Clark.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.836
Graduated from West Point
in 1966.

10:28.086 --> 10:30.506
Went to Oxford, went to Vietnam,
came home on a stretcher.

10:30.672 --> 10:32.466
Signed as a NATO
Supreme Allied Commander.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.260
I ran for president
in 2003, 2004.

10:35.511 --> 10:36.845
Went into investment banking.

10:39.014 --> 10:41.016
Narrator: Rodman & Renshaw
had a troubled past.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.768
After years
of management turmoil,

10:43.935 --> 10:45.937
they declared bankruptcy
in the late '90s.

10:46.605 --> 10:48.148
But with a luminary
like General Clark

10:48.315 --> 10:50.192
as their public face,
they'd reemerged

10:50.359 --> 10:51.776
as a respectable-looking bank,

10:52.027 --> 10:54.279
hosting parties
and selling Chinese stock.

10:54.446 --> 10:57.115
They would typically invite
presidents,

10:57.949 --> 11:00.702
ex-presidents, Colin Powell,

11:00.827 --> 11:03.497
Diana Ross, Henry Kissinger.

11:03.914 --> 11:05.749
Roddy: For an hour or two,
having Henry Kissinger

11:05.916 --> 11:08.252
or George Bush
or Wesley Clark speak--

11:08.752 --> 11:10.212
boy, oh, boy,
like you're going into

11:10.379 --> 11:13.131
some inner sanctum of knowledge,
when, you know,

11:13.298 --> 11:15.175
Kissinger's 90 years old,
talking out his ass.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.594
You can see
what's happening there.

11:16.718 --> 11:18.512
They're renting a name
for an hour or two.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.598
Wesley: These people all work
for fees.

11:21.139 --> 11:22.182
That's how they make money.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.017
When luminaries speak at it,

11:24.184 --> 11:25.644
more power to 'em.

11:26.144 --> 11:28.188
Narrator: During the six years
that General Clark
was chairman,

11:28.355 --> 11:30.774
Rodman & Renshaw brought
over 40 Chinese companies

11:30.941 --> 11:33.235
to U.S. markets,
with an aggregate value

11:33.402 --> 11:35.613
of over $31 billion.

11:39.658 --> 11:41.577
Narrator: While Rodman and Roth
made fees

11:41.743 --> 11:43.579
for bringing Chinese companies
to the U.S.,

11:43.745 --> 11:45.163
the real paydays came

11:45.330 --> 11:48.417
when the companies listed
on major stock exchanges

11:50.085 --> 11:51.920
Their analysts would
recommend the risky stocks

11:52.129 --> 11:54.548
as great investments,
and then their salesmen--

11:54.714 --> 11:57.717
like Matt, would push them
on their investment network.

12:02.013 --> 12:03.641
Narrator: Once the stocks rose
high enough,

12:03.807 --> 12:05.725
the banks and insiders
could cash out,

12:05.892 --> 12:07.852
leaving others holding
the overvalued shares.

12:09.480 --> 12:10.939
The catch was,
listing a company

12:11.106 --> 12:13.317
on the stock exchange
normally required audits

12:13.484 --> 12:14.652
and public vetting,

12:15.193 --> 12:17.195
but the banks found a way
around all that.

12:17.946 --> 12:20.865
They used a backdoor process
called a reverse merger.

12:21.783 --> 12:23.868
It's dollar denominated.
It trades onshore,

12:24.035 --> 12:25.996
the New York Stock Exchange,
the NASDAQ.

12:26.163 --> 12:28.332
It's normally a shell company

12:28.624 --> 12:30.959
that is a public-traded stock

12:31.418 --> 12:33.337
that has no operations
underneath it.

12:33.545 --> 12:34.630
You need to go to Nevada.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.214
A lot of them were there,

12:36.548 --> 12:38.049
that had started off as
mining companies or whatever,

12:38.216 --> 12:40.885
and they were just sort of
sitting there, waiting,

12:41.970 --> 12:44.139
you know, to find
the right partner

12:44.306 --> 12:45.474
who could merge into them.

12:45.641 --> 12:46.391
So you need the shell company.

12:47.225 --> 12:48.810
Narrator: Here's how
these reverse mergers work.

12:49.186 --> 12:50.937
a Chinese company
looking for a way

12:51.104 --> 12:53.565
into American exchanges
merges with the shell

12:53.732 --> 12:56.067
of a defunct U.S. company
that no longer operates

12:56.234 --> 12:58.612
but still legally exists
and has a listing

12:58.778 --> 13:00.197
on a U.S. stock exchange.

13:00.656 --> 13:01.823
The Chinese company then takes

13:01.990 --> 13:04.034
the shell company's place
in the market.

13:04.242 --> 13:05.703
Presto! You just appear.

13:05.869 --> 13:07.746
You're a stock
that's trading in the U.S.,

13:07.912 --> 13:09.456
and you've got a story to tell.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.124
And no one asks any questions.

13:15.086 --> 13:17.673
Narrator: Between 2006 and 2012,

13:17.922 --> 13:21.009
over 400 Chinese companies
listed on U.S. markets.

13:22.052 --> 13:24.095
80 percent of them
were reverse mergers.

13:25.013 --> 13:27.265
Our exchanges
are monitoring them.

13:27.641 --> 13:30.477
Our banks are vetting
these companies.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.062
You don't have
to worry about them

13:32.229 --> 13:33.897
because they're
on the U.S. exchanges.

13:41.572 --> 13:42.573
Dan: Oh, you're in Hong Kong?

13:43.741 --> 13:45.283
Late on the 30th.

13:45.992 --> 13:49.413
Dan: Between 2009 and mid-2010,

13:49.621 --> 13:52.832
the average China-based
reverse merger

13:53.542 --> 13:56.670
was up several hundred percent--
the average!

13:57.337 --> 13:58.838
Could you tell me
what China did last night?

13:59.839 --> 14:01.592
We stuck with
our value-investing approach.

14:02.467 --> 14:05.011
And with that approach
and with our guidelines,

14:05.596 --> 14:08.348
that took us to a lot
of China-based companies.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.225
And we made
several hundred percent

14:10.392 --> 14:11.560
on all of 'em.

14:13.061 --> 14:15.689
Longwei Petroleum,
bought them, $1, $1.50.

14:15.939 --> 14:18.191
We sold, $5, $6,
500 percent profit.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.943
L&L Energy,

14:20.110 --> 14:22.571
bought them for under $2,
sold it between $9 and $10.

14:22.821 --> 14:24.782
Puda Coal, bought them
for around $4,

14:24.948 --> 14:26.366
sold them for around $7,
great company.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.702
China Agriculture, CAGC.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.454
$9, sold them at $28.

14:30.621 --> 14:31.913
All great companies.

14:34.541 --> 14:35.793
We were back.

14:49.681 --> 14:50.724
Narrator: By 2010,

14:51.391 --> 14:53.184
Dan and the guys
at Roth and Rodman

14:53.351 --> 14:55.312
were making a killing
on the China stocks.

14:57.648 --> 14:59.399
It seemed like
it would never end,

14:59.650 --> 15:01.443
and maybe it wouldn't have,
had it not been

15:01.610 --> 15:03.779
for one earnest young
American businessman

15:03.945 --> 15:05.071
who'd gone to Shanghai to seek

15:05.238 --> 15:07.031
a completely different
type of fortune.

15:10.577 --> 15:11.662
Carson: The business I set up

15:11.829 --> 15:13.413
was the first
self-storage business

15:13.580 --> 15:14.832
in mainland China.

15:14.998 --> 15:16.958
It was called
Love Box Self Storage.

15:17.584 --> 15:18.669
World-class.

15:19.670 --> 15:20.879
And we did win an award

15:21.045 --> 15:23.173
for self-storage facility
of the year.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.175
On the way to setting up
that business,

15:25.342 --> 15:27.761
I co-authored"Doing Business
in China For Dummies."

15:30.555 --> 15:33.350
Narrator: Carson's father,
a stockbroker back in the U.S.,

15:33.725 --> 15:35.435
wanted to invest
in Orient Paper,

15:35.602 --> 15:37.813
a company that Roth Capital
had brought to the markets

15:37.979 --> 15:39.481
through a reverse merger.

15:40.524 --> 15:42.484
The company claimed that
it was doing $100 million

15:42.651 --> 15:44.820
in business a year
and shipping tons

15:44.986 --> 15:46.905
of high-quality paper
all over China.

15:47.906 --> 15:49.282
It was one of
the fast-growing companies

15:49.449 --> 15:50.784
that Roth and Rodman had sold

15:51.159 --> 15:52.952
and that investors
like Dan had bought.

15:53.745 --> 15:55.497
Richard: The goal was
to do some research,

15:55.664 --> 15:57.081
make sure that it was legit.

15:57.666 --> 15:59.209
His father would
write up the report.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.461
Again, a fairly easy
to understand

16:01.628 --> 16:02.838
and analyze business

16:03.213 --> 16:06.299
the opposite of
an American software company.

16:07.217 --> 16:08.968
Narrator: Carson and a friend
went to check out the factory,

16:09.135 --> 16:11.221
but right away,
something seemed off.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.182
Carson: It was a country road.
It was in poor shape.

16:14.349 --> 16:18.269
That road could not support
the massive trucks

16:18.729 --> 16:21.690
that would be going in and out
of that facility all day.

16:22.524 --> 16:23.817
Then we got into the factory.

16:28.321 --> 16:29.865
Roddy: It was a complete dump.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.992
Half the machines were broken,
weren't working.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.287
Garbage rotting
out in the front yard,

16:36.454 --> 16:37.539
no signage.

16:38.081 --> 16:39.917
And this is their main
manufacturing facility.

16:40.083 --> 16:41.501
There's water everywhere,
all right?

16:41.668 --> 16:43.461
This is a company
that's a paper company.

16:44.588 --> 16:46.715
Carson: The company had just
claimed to have clocked in

16:46.882 --> 16:48.592
$100 million U.S. in revenue,

16:48.759 --> 16:50.969
which was up substantially
from the year before.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.471
How was this growing
50 percent a year?

16:53.638 --> 16:55.557
On the balance sheet,
they were showing about...

16:55.933 --> 16:58.769
$5 million in raw materials.

16:59.227 --> 17:01.020
Carson: And so they had
heaps and heaps

17:01.187 --> 17:03.815
of this old corrugated
cardboard out front.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.983
Carson: My friend climbed
one of those heaps

17:06.150 --> 17:09.613
to take a look at the expanse
of rotting cardboard,

17:10.029 --> 17:11.615
and when he came down,
he said,

17:11.865 --> 17:13.867
"If this is worth $5 million,

17:14.157 --> 17:16.286
the world's a much richer place
than I knew."

17:16.703 --> 17:19.038
Carson and his dad looked
at each other at that point

17:19.623 --> 17:23.376
ah, and said,"There's probably
something to do in this stock,

17:23.794 --> 17:25.169
but it has nothing to do
with owning it."

17:25.462 --> 17:28.966
[camera shutter clicking,
flashbulb whining]

17:35.346 --> 17:37.641
Carson: This business
was a complete sham.

17:38.016 --> 17:40.226
This is going to zero.
It's a total fraud.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.979
I've never seen
anything like this.

17:42.938 --> 17:44.648
Narrator: Carson wrote a report
of his findings

17:45.189 --> 17:46.900
and announced that he was
going to back his claims

17:47.066 --> 17:48.401
by making a bet in the market

17:48.568 --> 17:49.945
that the stock would collapse.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.447
It would change
the course of his life,

17:53.114 --> 17:55.116
but more importantly,
it was the first time

17:55.283 --> 17:57.410
anyone had poked a hole
in the Chinese miracle.

17:58.286 --> 17:59.788
Carson:
I sent it out into the ether

17:59.955 --> 18:01.999
in late June of 2010.

18:02.206 --> 18:04.459
I stayed up for a little bit
to watch it close,

18:04.626 --> 18:06.294
and going into the close,

18:07.170 --> 18:08.421
it just moved down a little bit.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.381
And so as I went to sleep,

18:10.548 --> 18:13.217
I wondered whether that was
a reaction to the report.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.679
Well, the next day
answered the question

18:16.013 --> 18:17.597
down 25 percent.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.641
And it ended up trading down

18:19.808 --> 18:21.267
as much as 55 percent

18:21.434 --> 18:23.353
from where
we had put out the report.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.647
Even though it's China
and it's a fast-growing economy,

18:26.230 --> 18:28.566
pigs do not fly in China,
and I think that...

18:28.733 --> 18:30.652
Carson:
There's a proverb in Chinese,

18:31.319 --> 18:33.488
"Muddy waters makes it
easy to catch fish."

18:41.162 --> 18:43.456
Yeah, so it means water.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.544
Huh.

18:47.836 --> 18:49.838
That saying,
"Muddy waters makes it easy

18:50.005 --> 18:51.798
to catch fish,"
explains so much

18:51.965 --> 18:53.341
about what goes on
in China.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.638
Carson:
Opacity creates opportunities

18:58.972 --> 19:00.223
for people to make money.

19:01.182 --> 19:04.019
That's China's view,
muddy waters.

19:04.185 --> 19:05.979
I thought that
that was a very apropos name

19:06.145 --> 19:08.272
for the firm and chose it.

19:11.317 --> 19:14.320
[waves crashing,
seagulls screeching]

19:17.281 --> 19:18.199
Narrator:
The"Muddy Waters Report"

19:18.366 --> 19:19.826
was the first major claim

19:19.993 --> 19:22.037
against a Chinese company,
and it began to resonate

19:22.370 --> 19:23.371
throughout the industry

19:24.205 --> 19:26.124
nowhere more so
than at Roth Capital,

19:26.541 --> 19:27.584
who'd engineered the deal.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.504
Target price,
less than a dollar.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.049
You have pictures
of dirty factories.

19:34.298 --> 19:36.259
You have pictures
of recycled paper on the ground.

19:37.052 --> 19:39.345
You have people climbing...
pictures.

19:41.890 --> 19:43.182
This is a $150-million company.

19:46.144 --> 19:47.353
It's pretty crazy though.

19:49.606 --> 19:51.942
Matt: I had sold
over $22 million of that deal.

19:57.488 --> 19:59.407
Matt: I remember
going into Byron's office,

19:59.657 --> 20:00.658
asking,"What's going on here?"

20:01.659 --> 20:04.121
Narrator: What was"going on"
was that the company

20:04.287 --> 20:06.915
had deployed a classic move
in the reverse-merger playbook:

20:07.665 --> 20:09.709
get a stamp of approval
from a trusted source.

20:10.376 --> 20:11.586
Deloitte and Touche
had come out

20:11.753 --> 20:13.171
with an independent
investigation saying

20:13.337 --> 20:15.214
that the company was
accurately telling

20:15.381 --> 20:16.674
about its financial statements.

20:17.258 --> 20:18.217
Narrator:
In the mortgage crisis,

20:18.509 --> 20:19.844
banks used rating agencies

20:20.011 --> 20:21.679
to disguise
crappy mortgage bonds.

20:22.097 --> 20:24.099
Now Orient Paper was using

20:24.265 --> 20:25.850
an even more
recognizable cover

20:26.476 --> 20:28.436
one of the Big Four
global audit firms.

20:30.438 --> 20:32.356
Every day,
all around the world,

20:32.523 --> 20:34.734
Deloitte professionals are
making an impact that matters...

20:35.193 --> 20:36.153
Narrator:
It turns out that dozens

20:36.319 --> 20:37.612
of Chinese reverse mergers

20:37.779 --> 20:39.823
used the same trick
hiding shady financials

20:39.990 --> 20:41.825
behind audits
from the Big Four.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.661
It was like handing investors
a shiny, thin file

20:44.828 --> 20:46.287
stamped,"Trust me."

20:47.413 --> 20:49.373
Because when it comes
to living our purpose,

20:49.791 --> 20:51.250
it all starts with integrity.

20:53.837 --> 20:56.339
Carson: Whether it's Deloitte
or PwC,

20:56.756 --> 21:00.551
they expect these brands
to have significant value

21:00.718 --> 21:03.930
wherever they are in the world,
but in actuality,

21:04.097 --> 21:05.974
the way these partnerships
are structured

21:06.307 --> 21:10.145
is that each office
is its own entity.

21:10.311 --> 21:11.980
Roddy: So they were able
to dollarize

21:12.271 --> 21:14.315
renting their name out,
effectively.

21:14.565 --> 21:16.526
All they hoped was that
this company didn't collapse.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.072
Many of these companies
would say,"Well, look.

21:21.239 --> 21:22.740
We're being audited
by Pricewaterhouse."

21:22.949 --> 21:24.367
No, they're not.

21:24.701 --> 21:26.911
They're being audited
by Pricewaterhouse China,

21:27.078 --> 21:28.621
which is like a franchise.

21:28.872 --> 21:30.581
It's not really
Pricewaterhouse.

21:30.748 --> 21:33.710
[siren wailing,
indistinct chatter]

21:33.877 --> 21:35.628
Jim: In the United States,
whenever we've had

21:35.795 --> 21:38.173
a massive fraud--
that we've been short

21:38.297 --> 21:40.508
people always ask me,
"Well, who were the auditors?"

21:41.092 --> 21:42.510
And I always say,
"Who cares?"

21:44.303 --> 21:46.097
Jim:
It's important to understand,

21:46.389 --> 21:47.849
and most people
don't know this,

21:48.016 --> 21:50.351
that the financial statements
are prepared by management,

21:50.601 --> 21:51.853
not by the auditors.

21:53.897 --> 21:57.316
Jim: Auditor's job is to simply
review management's work.

21:57.942 --> 22:00.070
And if management is trying
to hide something

22:00.653 --> 22:03.198
or has co-opted the auditors,
they will hide it.

22:04.448 --> 22:05.783
Narrator:
If hiding it doesn't work,

22:05.950 --> 22:07.118
they opt for plan B.

22:07.702 --> 22:08.828
hire a good lawyer.

22:09.829 --> 22:12.540
Orient Paper brought in
Mitch Nussbaum of Loeb & Loeb

22:12.749 --> 22:14.918
to respond
to Muddy Waters'allegations.

22:16.211 --> 22:18.588
Mitch had helped bring dozens
of Chinese companies to market,

22:18.922 --> 22:20.006
and he knew how to fight back.

22:20.173 --> 22:22.259
You have short sellers who--
who go ahead

22:22.425 --> 22:23.885
and put a short position
on the company

22:24.052 --> 22:26.512
and then throw all sorts
of allegations against them...

22:26.846 --> 22:28.723
Narrator: Nussbaum's firm
led an investigation.

22:29.224 --> 22:30.600
His unsurprising conclusion

22:30.808 --> 22:32.560
was that Carson's allegations
were false

22:33.186 --> 22:34.938
and that his report
amounted to slander.

22:35.105 --> 22:37.023
How-- do I know what anybody's
telling me is true?

22:37.148 --> 22:38.775
Host: That's a huge problem.
It's a huge problem.

22:38.900 --> 22:40.277
Host: All right,

22:40.526 --> 22:43.113
Man: Let's talk about
a case where you did a type

22:43.280 --> 22:44.281
of forensic investigation--

22:44.488 --> 22:45.656
um hmm.
Producer: Orient Paper.

22:46.032 --> 22:48.367
I wouldn't be prepared
in these circumstances

22:48.534 --> 22:51.329
to discuss or present any more
or additional information

22:51.495 --> 22:53.581
than what we disclosed publicly,
because that wouldn't be,

22:54.082 --> 22:55.208
you know, appropriate.

23:00.671 --> 23:02.423
Narrator: The Chinese businesses
were a huge profit center

23:02.590 --> 23:03.466
for Loeb & Loeb,

23:04.425 --> 23:05.843
but I imagined
that the company's

23:06.010 --> 23:07.386
often-shoddy paperwork

23:07.553 --> 23:09.097
posed a problem for Nussbaum
and his colleagues.

23:10.473 --> 23:12.558
I wondered how just how much
diligence they had to do

23:12.725 --> 23:14.144
to satisfy regulators.

23:15.645 --> 23:17.272
Forget about the lawyer.
Forget about the banker.

23:17.772 --> 23:19.065
The banker doesn't go
into the books

23:19.232 --> 23:20.317
and records of the company.

23:20.483 --> 23:21.609
The lawyers don't go
into the books

23:21.776 --> 23:22.860
and records of the companies.

23:23.153 --> 23:25.446
We don't go check
to see whether

23:25.780 --> 23:27.157
the shipments were received.

23:27.573 --> 23:29.617
You know, we don't go visit
the customers'homes.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.577
I mean, no law firm does this.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.246
No law firm does this.

23:33.579 --> 23:34.789
Narrator:
This is the part of the story

23:34.914 --> 23:36.124
where I had to do
a double take.

23:36.958 --> 23:39.210
All of the people who
we think of as gatekeepers,

23:39.418 --> 23:41.296
the lawyers,
the bankers, the auditors,

23:42.088 --> 23:43.173
the people making good money

23:43.340 --> 23:44.841
to ensure that
the markets are clean,

23:45.466 --> 23:46.968
weren't doing
anything of the sort.

23:47.927 --> 23:50.013
They simply processed
the necessary paperwork,

23:50.263 --> 23:51.889
took their fees, and moved on.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.642
If the companies were lying,
so what?

23:55.726 --> 23:57.436
[thunder rumbling,
rain pattering]

23:59.605 --> 24:01.482
The answers
that I was receiving

24:02.441 --> 24:06.029
was insufficient
to thwart my concerns.

24:07.155 --> 24:08.739
And I didn't feel they were
thorough enough

24:09.073 --> 24:10.616
answers to questions.

24:13.370 --> 24:14.453
Matt: And that's when

24:14.787 --> 24:16.914
everything significantly
changed for me.

24:17.456 --> 24:20.084
My eyes were open
to this concept

24:20.335 --> 24:23.462
that there was another side
to this company.

24:28.009 --> 24:30.887
Matt: I knew what my job was.
I knew what I couldn't do

24:31.137 --> 24:32.722
if I was sitting
in that seat still.

24:33.139 --> 24:35.599
So for me, it was... quit,

24:36.226 --> 24:38.436
go take a break,
and see what happens.

24:39.103 --> 24:40.021
I went on safari.

24:48.612 --> 24:51.032
I'm at a Rodman & Renshaw
conference,

24:51.824 --> 24:54.327
and a firm by the name
of Muddy Waters

24:54.660 --> 24:56.954
puts out a report
on Orient Paper,

24:58.289 --> 24:59.749
and it goes down significantly.

25:00.166 --> 25:03.753
And this is the first time
that we're actually hearing

25:03.920 --> 25:05.755
somebody's publishing a report
and calling it fraud.

25:07.840 --> 25:08.883
Dan: We decided that

25:09.133 --> 25:11.135
we were either good
at what we do

25:11.802 --> 25:15.098
or we were lucky,
and if we were lucky,

25:15.514 --> 25:16.807
we were about
to go out of business.

25:16.933 --> 25:18.226
Chris: I'm trying to reach
either the general manager

25:18.351 --> 25:19.310
or the property manager...

25:19.436 --> 25:20.519
Dan: So we hired our own team.

25:22.021 --> 25:23.940
Dan:
And our own team went to China

25:24.107 --> 25:27.485
to vet some of these companies
that were accused of fraud.

25:27.651 --> 25:30.113
Man: Let's talk about
China Green Agriculture.

25:30.488 --> 25:32.156
China Green Agriculture
came to our attention

25:32.323 --> 25:34.658
originally in 2009.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.871
Dan: And we invested long
into what we thought was

25:39.038 --> 25:40.331
a great fertilizer company.

25:40.915 --> 25:42.417
Their stock was pumping.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.920
Press releases were coming out
about deals they were making

25:46.087 --> 25:47.630
with Nestlé and whoever else.

25:48.547 --> 25:49.757
Narrator: Dan calculated that

25:49.924 --> 25:51.468
in order
to fulfill these contracts,

25:51.801 --> 25:53.261
dozens of trucks
would have to be loading

25:53.428 --> 25:55.138
and unloading goods all day.

25:56.806 --> 25:58.641
So even though
monitoring private companies

25:58.808 --> 25:59.934
is illegal in China,

26:00.101 --> 26:01.936
his team risked
lengthy jail terms

26:02.103 --> 26:04.897
to set up surveillance cameras
outside the factory gates.

26:05.982 --> 26:10.361
We filmed them for 344 days.

26:10.736 --> 26:12.489
Tapes showed us
of very little activity going,

26:12.655 --> 26:14.240
very few employees
coming in and out.

26:17.327 --> 26:18.786
Narrator: Dan figured that
if the company was doing

26:18.953 --> 26:20.538
what it said it was,
it would have

26:20.704 --> 26:23.124
hundreds of employees
and dozens of drivers.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.710
Dan: So what we do is,
we have our investigator

26:27.253 --> 26:28.587
pose as a tea salesman.

26:29.672 --> 26:31.174
So he shows up,
and he's got a suitcase

26:31.341 --> 26:34.218
full of tea samples,
says he's a tea salesman

26:34.385 --> 26:37.263
and he wants to give
free tea samples for everybody.

26:47.690 --> 26:49.775
Dan: So tell me how many
employees you have here

26:50.151 --> 26:51.902
so I can give you
enough samples.

26:52.236 --> 26:52.987
We get that answer.

26:56.199 --> 26:58.617
Man: What did it mean that
they only had one truck driver?

26:59.827 --> 27:01.162
It meant that their volume

27:01.329 --> 27:04.623
was vastly less
than they had claimed.

27:11.255 --> 27:12.882
In the first half of this year,

27:13.090 --> 27:16.719
Ah, Yongye grew both revenues
and net income by about
100 percent.

27:17.053 --> 27:18.721
Narrator: Calling out
China Green Agriculture meant

27:18.888 --> 27:20.848
that Dan was also questioning
the integrity

27:21.015 --> 27:23.059
of some of the guys he'd ridden
the China-stock wave up with.

27:23.518 --> 27:24.935
guys like Crocker Coulson,

27:25.102 --> 27:27.021
a stock promoter
who'd pushed this stock

27:27.313 --> 27:28.147
and dozens like it.

27:28.731 --> 27:31.067
What about, um,
China Green Agriculture?

27:31.901 --> 27:34.862
Crocker: So that's another
fertilizer story that we were...

27:35.572 --> 27:38.074
Again, this kind of goes back
a fair ways for me.

27:38.241 --> 27:39.283
Yeah.
I believe that was

27:39.409 --> 27:41.160
an organic fertilizer.

27:41.327 --> 27:42.537
It was also supposed to have...

27:43.037 --> 27:44.247
um...

27:44.622 --> 27:46.457
I really don't remember
a whole lot about that company.

27:46.999 --> 27:49.210
What we came up with is,
they were doing 10 percent

27:49.377 --> 27:50.628
of the business
that they claimed.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.046
And then the fight began.

27:53.548 --> 27:56.509
Dan: Puts out a press release
calling us terrorists,

27:56.926 --> 27:59.262
saboteurs, criminals.

28:00.096 --> 28:02.557
There was a statement from
five Beijing finance professors

28:02.765 --> 28:04.601
who alleged
wealthy and sophisticated

28:04.767 --> 28:05.976
short sellers from overseas

28:06.143 --> 28:07.811
were robbing
small Chinese investors

28:07.978 --> 28:10.981
and ignoring risks
of market instability.

28:11.190 --> 28:12.525
They didn't cite any evidence.

28:13.109 --> 28:15.403
Just to be clear,
we put a lot of effort

28:15.570 --> 28:17.280
into trying
to weed out companies,

28:17.988 --> 28:19.574
you know,
before representing them

28:19.865 --> 28:21.909
and then to flag problems,

28:22.743 --> 28:24.245
serious problems,
if we saw them.

28:24.412 --> 28:25.580
There was no way to know

28:25.871 --> 28:27.415
which were the good actors
and bad actors.

28:29.875 --> 28:32.711
A gate guard
knows what's happening.

28:35.590 --> 28:37.216
Dan: So we went
to the investment banks.

28:37.592 --> 28:40.094
We took them our evidence.
We said,"Look what we found.

28:41.095 --> 28:43.180
If you hire us and our team
to do diligence,

28:43.514 --> 28:44.641
you'll have a better product

28:44.807 --> 28:45.933
to sell to
the American people."

28:47.184 --> 28:48.185
They said,"Get out of here.

28:49.395 --> 28:52.815
You're telling us to pay you
not to collect 10 percent fees

28:52.982 --> 28:54.900
on every transaction
done through this bank.

28:55.901 --> 28:58.946
The less we know, the better,
and by the way,

28:59.113 --> 29:00.739
if you tell anybody
what you found, we'll sue you.

29:02.116 --> 29:03.242
Go back to Skippack."

29:05.703 --> 29:06.787
So we went back to Skippack.

29:08.038 --> 29:09.415
We published our research.

29:11.417 --> 29:13.252
Narrator: Dan's report laid out
his allegations

29:13.419 --> 29:15.212
against China
Green Agriculture.

29:16.005 --> 29:18.215
Dan: The stock trades
for a dollar today.

29:20.468 --> 29:21.927
You know, it turns out
nobody believes them.

29:23.012 --> 29:24.347
Man: What happened
to the chairman?

29:25.389 --> 29:27.766
Nothing.
I mean, he's kept the money.

29:28.934 --> 29:30.436
And that's what this
is all about, right?

29:30.603 --> 29:34.190
That's $113 million that has
just, poof, vanished

29:34.982 --> 29:37.776
Ah, because they never really
did that kind of volume.

29:39.778 --> 29:42.281
Narrator: Dan realized he'd made
money off of companies'lies,

29:42.740 --> 29:43.824
and it gnawed at him,

29:44.450 --> 29:45.868
because he knew he'd crossed

29:46.118 --> 29:48.496
into what a lot of people see
as the dark side of finance--

29:48.996 --> 29:49.830
short selling.

29:56.962 --> 29:58.172
Herb: What is short selling?

29:58.422 --> 29:59.549
Hmm, let me think about this.

29:59.716 --> 30:01.342
I want to-- this is always
a difficult one.

30:01.509 --> 30:02.968
But short--

30:03.135 --> 30:05.012
What is--

30:05.262 --> 30:06.972
Well, the first short
economically

30:07.139 --> 30:09.767
was probably some transaction
between, you know,

30:09.933 --> 30:11.435
two Cro-Magnon person,

30:11.602 --> 30:14.480
promising some guy--
some other Cro-Magnon

30:14.647 --> 30:15.690
part of a saber-tooth tiger.

30:16.023 --> 30:17.525
Narrator: This is Jim Chanos.

30:17.692 --> 30:18.817
He's the dean of short sellers.

30:19.985 --> 30:22.363
And he's brought down some of
the biggest frauds in history.

30:22.988 --> 30:24.615
If you want to think
about short selling,

30:24.782 --> 30:27.117
all kinds of commercial
transactions are short selling.

30:27.284 --> 30:29.704
An airline that sells you
an advance-purchase ticket,

30:29.870 --> 30:32.206
for example,
is shorting you a seat.

30:32.623 --> 30:35.251
Short selling is betting
that a stock is gonna go down,

30:35.501 --> 30:36.586
as opposed to go up.

30:36.794 --> 30:38.128
So shorting a stock,

30:38.337 --> 30:41.131
you'll often hear it referred to
as"borrowing shares."

30:41.382 --> 30:43.342
Narrator: This is where
a lot of people get confused.

30:43.760 --> 30:44.843
Here's a simple way
to think of it.

30:46.053 --> 30:47.680
Narrator:
Say I want to short sugar.

30:48.138 --> 30:50.057
I think that sugar
is overvalued

30:50.224 --> 30:52.476
and it's going to cost less
in, say, six months

30:52.643 --> 30:53.936
than it does today.

30:54.687 --> 30:55.979
I see a business opportunity.

30:56.355 --> 30:59.149
I go to my neighbor
and borrow one pound of sugar.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.402
Then I turn right around
and sell that sugar

31:01.569 --> 31:03.279
for the going rate
of $1 a pound.

31:03.487 --> 31:04.488
Manly Voice: Yeah!

31:04.655 --> 31:05.989
Narrator: In about six months,

31:06.282 --> 31:08.242
when I have to give my neighbor
a pound of sugar back,

31:08.826 --> 31:11.912
I go buy it on the open market,
where the price has come down,

31:12.455 --> 31:13.956
and it only costs me 50 cents.

31:14.248 --> 31:15.874
I give my neighbor
a pound of sugar back,

31:16.041 --> 31:17.627
plus a little extra
for interest,

31:18.001 --> 31:20.087
and pocket
the 50-cent difference.

31:20.379 --> 31:23.507
She's got her sugar back,
and I've made money on my bet.

31:24.258 --> 31:26.969
You want everybody else
who's trading in that stock

31:27.136 --> 31:29.305
to believe what you're saying

31:29.472 --> 31:31.390
if you think that
the company is a fraud

31:31.557 --> 31:34.059
or you think that something
about the company is not true.

31:34.226 --> 31:36.312
The person that's most
attracted to short selling

31:36.479 --> 31:38.897
is probably those who've been
dropped on their heads at birth.

31:39.106 --> 31:40.817
They're iconoclasts.

31:40.983 --> 31:42.652
Do I believe that their
motivation was to--

31:42.819 --> 31:44.695
was justice for the world?

31:44.862 --> 31:46.947
No, I think their motivation
was to profit from this.

31:47.114 --> 31:49.158
It's about cleaning
our financial markets.

31:49.325 --> 31:50.534
It's about stopping a fraud.

31:50.701 --> 31:52.286
What I really want to do is,

31:52.453 --> 31:53.579
I want to reach in...

31:53.788 --> 31:55.832
Narrator: Remember this guy,
Dick Fuld?

31:56.248 --> 31:57.916
He ran Lehman Brothers,
the bank whose collapse

31:58.083 --> 32:00.419
set off the financial crisis
in 2008.

32:01.086 --> 32:02.839
He's got an opinion
about short sellers.

32:03.046 --> 32:06.091
Rip out their heart,
and eat it before they die.

32:08.177 --> 32:09.970
Mitch: So there are
a lot of problems here.

32:10.137 --> 32:11.514
There are a lot
of problems here.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.433
Dan:
When I bet against a company,

32:15.017 --> 32:16.644
it's because I believe

32:16.811 --> 32:18.479
that they're misrepresenting.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.440
And their trend line
doesn't matter to me at all.

32:22.650 --> 32:25.944
I am somebody that will
bet against fraud.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.284
Narrator: As Dan and Carson
began looking

32:32.451 --> 32:34.036
for other Chinese companies
to short,

32:34.578 --> 32:36.539
Matt was just getting back
from his safari.

32:37.540 --> 32:39.667
He'd been out of the loop
and wanted to make sense

32:39.834 --> 32:40.835
of what he'd been a part of.

32:41.669 --> 32:42.837
So he asked his friend Soren,

32:43.295 --> 32:45.005
a finance industry lawyer
from New York,

32:45.464 --> 32:47.174
to meet him for a weekend
in the mountains

32:47.424 --> 32:48.843
and take a look
at some of the documents

32:49.009 --> 32:50.636
he'd saved
from his time at Roth.

32:51.721 --> 32:54.056
In the process,
they would discover a new way

32:54.223 --> 32:55.974
to look at the whole
landscape of fraud.

32:57.142 --> 32:59.562
Matt said,
"Just look at these companies.

33:00.270 --> 33:01.104
Tell me what you think."

33:06.360 --> 33:09.572
L&L Energy was nominally
a coal company.

33:13.033 --> 33:14.451
Soren:
Very typical of an RTO fraud

33:14.618 --> 33:16.704
in that
its financial performance

33:16.871 --> 33:18.205
was simply too good to be true.

33:24.044 --> 33:27.130
Soren: The notion
that a small reverse merger

33:27.339 --> 33:29.884
from rural China could somehow

33:30.050 --> 33:32.887
efficiently mine
and process coal

33:33.387 --> 33:36.014
so much better than the best
coal companies in the world

33:36.682 --> 33:37.808
was just not credible.

33:39.142 --> 33:40.394
Narrator:
Digging into the papers,

33:41.061 --> 33:42.229
they uncovered a new way

33:42.396 --> 33:44.273
to understand
what was really going on

33:44.440 --> 33:45.816
with the hundreds
of Chinese companies

33:45.983 --> 33:47.818
listed on U.S. exchanges.

33:48.569 --> 33:51.572
What we came back with were
what are called SAIC filings.

33:52.322 --> 33:54.825
They're these filings
from the State Office of, uh...

33:55.367 --> 33:57.327
Oh, my gosh, can't believe
I'm blanking on this.

33:57.912 --> 34:00.205
State Office of, uh, Adminis--

34:00.372 --> 34:02.291
State Administrative Office.
Is that right?

34:02.499 --> 34:04.752
Richard: The interesting part
here was that

34:05.127 --> 34:09.255
the filings in China
tended to be very accurate

34:09.422 --> 34:13.469
or more accurate than
the fictions that were filed

34:13.886 --> 34:15.554
with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

34:16.597 --> 34:19.099
Narrator: In China,
a company might accurately say

34:19.266 --> 34:21.518
they made $10 million,
while in the U.S.,

34:21.685 --> 34:24.062
they could report
making $100 million or more.

34:25.188 --> 34:26.983
These SAIC filings
were dead reliable.

34:27.274 --> 34:29.359
They showed exactly
what was going on.

34:32.862 --> 34:34.864
Dan: And this is-- this is
the cultural difference,

34:36.199 --> 34:40.704
we can't find auditors
in China that will help us,

34:41.079 --> 34:42.080
because let me
tell you something,

34:42.246 --> 34:44.541
if we do find those people,

34:45.125 --> 34:47.085
the government of China
will kill 'em.

34:47.670 --> 34:49.005
I mean, they will take
their ass out

34:49.338 --> 34:51.089
and shoot them
in the fucking head.

34:53.216 --> 34:54.927
Soren: This was, from the
beginning, a deception.

34:55.469 --> 34:58.096
The purpose of it
was to deceive,

34:58.263 --> 35:00.516
from day one, and we'd
never really seen that

35:00.808 --> 35:03.352
at this scale
in the United States market.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.437
And that's probably why
it took everyone by surprise.

35:07.439 --> 35:09.817
Narrator: That included Matt,
and his reaction was telling,

35:10.734 --> 35:12.569
maybe it says something
about human nature,

35:13.153 --> 35:15.113
about why we keep getting
into these messes.

35:16.532 --> 35:18.408
He realized that hundreds
of millions of dollars

35:18.575 --> 35:20.786
in Chinese reverse mergers
that he'd sold were frauds,

35:21.704 --> 35:24.999
but he didn't react
with shame, just pragmatism.

35:25.666 --> 35:28.126
He wanted to make sure he got
a piece of the ride down,

35:28.836 --> 35:30.128
so he switched sides

35:30.295 --> 35:32.297
and became a short seller,
like Dan.

35:34.050 --> 35:38.136
I-- I did it
and made 78 percent in...

35:38.804 --> 35:40.305
four days.

35:46.979 --> 35:49.147
Eventually LLEN collapsed.

35:49.899 --> 35:51.734
Narrator: For short sellers
like Dan and Matt,

35:52.109 --> 35:53.736
the filings were the final
piece of the puzzle--

35:54.528 --> 35:56.655
not just evidence
from one company or another

35:57.197 --> 35:58.782
but data from
all the companies.

35:59.783 --> 36:01.035
For the first time,
they could see

36:01.201 --> 36:02.745
the full scope
of the deception.

36:03.620 --> 36:05.122
Carson: I don't know
what the numbers are,

36:05.330 --> 36:06.874
but it's well into
the billions of dollars

36:07.041 --> 36:08.667
that U.S. investors have lost.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.920
$30 billion, I think
the number was $30 billion.

36:11.087 --> 36:12.379
$20 billion.
$50 billion.

36:12.546 --> 36:14.464
It's between
$20 billion and $50 billion

36:14.631 --> 36:17.300
of market capitalization
of stock that's listed

36:17.467 --> 36:20.345
here in the United States
that might be worth zero.

36:20.596 --> 36:23.015
Individual
mom-and-pop investors

36:23.181 --> 36:26.643
and mutual funds were invested
in these Chinese companies,

36:26.977 --> 36:29.187
so it really does affect

36:29.354 --> 36:31.189
the average person
on the street as well.

36:34.234 --> 36:36.570
Soren: If this one company
is so brazenly fraudulent,

36:37.905 --> 36:39.949
what does that say
about the rest of the market?

36:42.076 --> 36:44.369
Soren:
Over 300 reverse mergers

36:44.745 --> 36:46.872
with businesses operating
in China.

36:48.999 --> 36:50.500
This whole thing
could be fraudulent.

36:52.419 --> 36:54.212
And that money
could never be recovered,

36:54.588 --> 36:57.382
and if you got caught,
there was no consequences.

36:58.508 --> 36:59.802
When you talk about
the investment banks,

36:59.969 --> 37:01.095
especially the bigger ones,

37:01.804 --> 37:05.682
fraud is baked
into the income statement.

37:06.934 --> 37:08.144
How many investment banks

37:09.019 --> 37:12.355
have had to pay fines this year
for fraud?

37:13.899 --> 37:16.234
Wells Fargo? Check.

37:16.986 --> 37:18.862
Bank of America has in the past.
Check.

37:19.196 --> 37:20.948
Morgan Stanley has in the past.
Check.

37:21.448 --> 37:23.533
Nobody's going to jail.
It's a fine.

37:24.160 --> 37:25.661
So it becomes part--

37:26.244 --> 37:28.288
it becomes part
of what you budget.

37:28.956 --> 37:30.415
You budget for fraud.

37:34.586 --> 37:37.006
Narrator: Maybe Dan's fixation
on fraud comes from the fact

37:37.173 --> 37:39.175
that Flint, Michigan,
where he grew up,

37:39.549 --> 37:41.426
is the victim
of a kind of fraud.

37:43.804 --> 37:46.389
Big companies made big promises
to the people who lived there,

37:46.598 --> 37:48.475
and in the end,
they couldn't keep them.

37:50.186 --> 37:53.189
Dan saw firsthand how lies
coming from corporate offices

37:53.396 --> 37:55.315
actually affect
real people on the ground.

37:56.733 --> 37:58.610
Where other finance guys
see market machinations,

37:59.195 --> 38:00.654
Dan sees his hometown,

38:01.530 --> 38:03.991
busted, full of ghosts.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.296
Dan: This was a pretty nice area
30 years ago.

38:22.051 --> 38:23.301
Hmm.

38:30.100 --> 38:31.309
Dan: This was a school.

38:35.231 --> 38:37.107
Dan: By today's standards,
it was pretty violent.

38:39.651 --> 38:42.821
I mean, I can't even imagine
10, 11, and 12-year-old kids

38:42.988 --> 38:44.823
swinging bats
at each other today.

38:53.790 --> 38:54.875
No, I was definitely--

38:55.042 --> 38:56.543
I was happy growing up here,
for sure.

39:02.799 --> 39:04.134
Dan: Companies lie.

39:06.011 --> 39:07.345
Companies lie.

39:11.474 --> 39:14.561
Companies have companies'
best interests at heart--

39:15.478 --> 39:17.731
not a community's,
not a people's.

39:18.857 --> 39:21.359
The people need to have
their own interests at heart.

39:26.323 --> 39:27.407
Flint's an awesome town.

39:27.991 --> 39:29.451
It's always been
an awesome town.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.122
Very hardworking community.

39:34.664 --> 39:36.083
Very hardworking community.

39:42.131 --> 39:43.090
All right, look.

39:46.426 --> 39:49.221
I saw myself growing up in Flint

39:49.512 --> 39:51.056
and staying there forever.

39:53.600 --> 39:54.935
And then the jobs were gone.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.447
Narrator: Dan had investigated
the companies

40:07.614 --> 40:08.615
from the ground up.

40:09.074 --> 40:10.408
Matt had seen
the bird's-eye view

40:10.575 --> 40:11.868
of their SEC filings.

40:12.661 --> 40:14.246
Together they began to realize

40:14.412 --> 40:16.414
how shockingly simple
the whole thing was.

40:18.167 --> 40:20.085
Let's say that you wanted
to construct a fraud.

40:23.255 --> 40:24.965
Matt: What you would do is,
you would have a factory.

40:25.257 --> 40:26.091
You would have a chairman.

40:27.050 --> 40:28.344
And then you would find
someone,

40:28.510 --> 40:29.761
a gatekeeper, for example.

40:29.928 --> 40:33.056
A finder says,
"This is your business.

40:33.807 --> 40:35.934
What could you do
with $100 million?"

40:36.101 --> 40:38.187
Matt: He would help with
connections with auditors,

40:38.436 --> 40:40.189
legal tier-three banks.

40:40.856 --> 40:42.274
Dan: This operator in China
would be like,

40:42.732 --> 40:45.027
"Well, that'd be--
it would be a game changer."

40:45.402 --> 40:47.279
"I'd buy up my competition.
I could do this.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.281
I could do that.
I'd be this big."

40:49.614 --> 40:50.573
Get to the United States.

40:50.907 --> 40:52.492
Dan: This guy or this company
in China

40:52.826 --> 40:54.536
would say,
"Okay, I'm gonna get you

40:54.703 --> 40:57.497
a $100 million,
but this is what you have to do.

40:57.873 --> 41:00.625
You have to tell people
that you're already this big."

41:01.251 --> 41:03.253
You just had to make sure
that you checked all the boxes

41:03.795 --> 41:05.755
in order to get it to be sold.

41:05.922 --> 41:08.466
Dan: And don't worry,
because if they even find out

41:08.633 --> 41:10.844
that we're lying,
you won't go to jail.

41:10.969 --> 41:12.388
You're in China."
All you needed was

41:12.512 --> 41:13.847
the collusion
of a couple players,

41:13.972 --> 41:15.432
and you could defraud
anyone you wanted.

41:15.557 --> 41:16.975
Dan: And if we're lucky enough
to get the money

41:17.142 --> 41:18.060
and they find out you're lying,

41:18.310 --> 41:19.311
you get to keep the money.

41:19.895 --> 41:22.231
So there's really no risk here.
I'll do all the work.

41:22.772 --> 41:25.025
All you have to do
is continue to tell the lie.

41:26.860 --> 41:28.611
You know,
if you're gonna be a CEO

41:28.778 --> 41:30.488
of a public company,
you've got to be educated,

41:32.115 --> 41:35.160
gone to college, got an MBA.

41:35.327 --> 41:37.454
These guys had zero of that.

41:38.496 --> 41:40.123
Zero, a lot of these guys.

41:40.623 --> 41:43.460
They came from second,
third-tier cities in China.

41:43.626 --> 41:45.754
They came from a different way
of doing business...

41:48.173 --> 41:49.216
Like running
their own candy store

41:49.383 --> 41:50.759
type of way doing business.

41:52.719 --> 41:56.432
Dan: A Chinese chicken farmer
does not wake up one day

41:56.973 --> 42:01.103
and understand how to defraud
the U.S. capital markets.

42:01.686 --> 42:03.939
From the creation
of these little companies,

42:04.773 --> 42:06.442
it's all about
stock market fraud.

42:08.526 --> 42:10.028
Narrator: Once Dan, Matt,
and the other shorts

42:10.195 --> 42:12.072
figured out
the basic characteristics

42:12.239 --> 42:15.409
of the China frauds,
they started taking them out,
one by one.

42:16.785 --> 42:20.497
Puda Coal, the chairman,
stole investors'shares.

42:21.206 --> 42:23.500
SINO Clean Energy,
super technology.

42:23.666 --> 42:25.502
This company puts advertisements
on buses.

42:26.336 --> 42:28.380
Dan: They would crush coal,
mix it with water,

42:28.713 --> 42:31.508
and that was energy...
phenomenal.

42:32.384 --> 42:36.305
They hired none other
than Loeb & Loeb to sue us.

42:37.013 --> 42:38.348
China Integrated Energy,

42:39.266 --> 42:42.018
for weeks and weeks and weeks,
there was nothing happening
at this company.

42:42.394 --> 42:44.354
All of a sudden,
things get turned on.

42:44.771 --> 42:46.064
Lights start working.

42:46.731 --> 42:49.234
The next day,
Rodman & Renshaw shows up

42:49.443 --> 42:50.610
with a busload of investors.

42:52.154 --> 42:55.115
Take a tour of the facility,
get back on the bus, leave.

42:55.740 --> 42:56.908
All the lights go back off.

42:59.369 --> 43:01.413
Rodman investors,
invest in a bunch.

43:03.123 --> 43:06.584
You continue to find really
interesting anomalies in China.

43:06.793 --> 43:09.171
I talked to the people
who were running
the industrial gases

43:09.338 --> 43:10.506
that were feeding a steel mill.

43:10.672 --> 43:12.466
"We're making a profit
on this now,"

43:12.674 --> 43:14.259
and then they said,
"Yes, but there's a problem.

43:14.759 --> 43:17.513
It seems that
the gauges were wrong,

43:17.762 --> 43:21.433
and we, uh, did not deliver
as much gas

43:21.641 --> 43:23.477
as we charged
the steel mill for."

43:23.685 --> 43:25.020
I said,
"When did you find this out?"

43:25.187 --> 43:26.604
They said,"Just last week."

43:27.189 --> 43:29.065
I said,"And how much were
the gauges wrong?"

43:29.399 --> 43:31.651
"Uh, by the exact amount
of our profit.

43:33.570 --> 43:34.654
It's very strange."

43:53.048 --> 43:55.008
I've been told I am addressing
the Honorable Ho,

43:55.842 --> 43:57.886
whose ancestors have been
the glory of their provinces.

43:58.303 --> 44:01.515
I am humble Ho,
whose name stands in deep shadow

44:01.848 --> 44:03.725
before the tincture
of the great company.

44:03.975 --> 44:08.313
In China, business is done
following a tradition

44:08.605 --> 44:11.900
of not having a particularly
strong legal system.

44:12.234 --> 44:16.154
So people rely more on trust
and on personal relationships.

44:16.363 --> 44:18.865
I shall gain merit in the eyes
of the company
by being so trusted.

44:20.075 --> 44:23.245
There's a lot of focus
on building those relationships

44:23.537 --> 44:25.372
so that you can build the trust.

44:25.663 --> 44:29.667
The Chinese call this network
of personal relationships,
guanxi.

44:30.126 --> 44:33.213
Paul: And so I give you small
gifts and I do you favors,

44:33.630 --> 44:35.840
and then you owe me one.
You scratch my back,

44:36.132 --> 44:36.925
I'll scratch yours.

44:38.176 --> 44:40.095
Paul: If you do enough favors
of people,

44:40.387 --> 44:42.764
you have the ability
to call on them

44:43.056 --> 44:45.808
for a favor that might be
quite inconvenient for them.

44:46.851 --> 44:49.187
And that they would feel
an obligation

44:49.438 --> 44:50.606
to actually go forward.

44:54.526 --> 44:57.571
Narrator: This notion
that guanxi
wasn't just trading favors

44:58.113 --> 45:00.698
but represented something
more powerful is crucial.

45:03.159 --> 45:05.161
Dan had told me that going
after Chinese companies,

45:05.412 --> 45:07.914
could be dangerous.
But it wasn't until he told me

45:08.206 --> 45:11.000
the story of Alfred Little
that I really understood
what he meant.

45:12.461 --> 45:14.630
Dune: When these short reports
started coming out,

45:14.921 --> 45:16.465
there was a website
called Alfred Little.

45:17.507 --> 45:20.427
And it started publishing these
very interesting reports,

45:20.760 --> 45:22.137
the sort of the shoe leather,
like,

45:22.471 --> 45:24.889
"We've gone out and we sat
in front of this factory,

45:25.348 --> 45:26.516
and this is what we found."

45:27.976 --> 45:31.271
The website described
Alfred Little

45:31.605 --> 45:34.983
as an investor
with 35 years of experience,

45:35.233 --> 45:36.943
I think he was supposed
to have worked at Deloitte.

45:37.235 --> 45:38.736
You know, maybe he lived
in Shanghai.

45:38.945 --> 45:40.656
I mean, there was this whole
backstory, right?

45:42.157 --> 45:43.741
Dan: He basically says that,

45:44.117 --> 45:45.785
all these companies
in China are fraud,

45:47.078 --> 45:48.037
are just wholesale bullshit.

45:49.080 --> 45:50.290
And I was dismissive of it.

45:50.624 --> 45:52.750
I can't remember the date,
but I got an email saying,

45:53.209 --> 45:56.421
"I'm gonna be in New York.
Let's meet."

45:57.005 --> 45:59.675
I was like,"Oh, okay,"
so I go to this hotel,

46:00.258 --> 46:02.051
and there's this guy,
and he's like,

46:02.260 --> 46:03.136
"Oh, I'm Jon Carnes."

46:03.845 --> 46:05.472
Like,
"I'm the guy who's been...

46:05.681 --> 46:06.931
you know, I'm Alfred Little."

46:16.566 --> 46:18.985
Narrator: As one of the few
Westerners still working
as a short seller

46:19.194 --> 46:20.236
inside China,

46:20.778 --> 46:23.281
Carnes knew how to be careful
and cover his tracks.

46:24.533 --> 46:26.535
Posing as Alfred Little
had served him well.

46:28.203 --> 46:30.163
But when he decided
to take on Silvercorp,

46:30.455 --> 46:32.790
a mining company
in rural Hunan province,

46:33.583 --> 46:36.586
he and his investigators
would find out the dark side
of guanxi.

46:37.337 --> 46:39.464
You know, some companies
are more aggressive than others,

46:39.881 --> 46:44.678
but in general, I've found that
the more truthful the report,

46:45.053 --> 46:48.848
the more difficult it is
for a company to explain

46:50.099 --> 46:51.267
these negative truths,

46:52.435 --> 46:56.314
the more likely they're going
to commit some form
of retaliation.

46:57.190 --> 46:59.401
Because if
a company can't answer

46:59.568 --> 47:01.611
the questions raised
by the short seller,

47:02.362 --> 47:07.450
then they look for other means
to stop the negative reports.

47:10.495 --> 47:12.997
Narrator: As Alfred Little
began to publicly
question Silvercorp,

47:13.456 --> 47:15.083
the company's stock price
started to drop.

47:15.958 --> 47:17.502
Company officials called
in favors

47:17.711 --> 47:18.920
with the local authorities.

47:19.962 --> 47:21.881
Police began to threaten
Little's chief researcher,

47:22.340 --> 47:23.216
Kun Huang,

47:24.384 --> 47:26.469
detaining him for hours
or days at a time,

47:27.220 --> 47:29.180
demanding to know whom
he was really working for.

47:31.808 --> 47:33.851
Carnes knew that
there was no cavalry coming.

47:34.644 --> 47:38.314
He'd asked the SEC for help,
and they said their phones,
couldn't even dial China,

47:38.981 --> 47:40.400
let alone protect him
and his team.

47:43.194 --> 47:45.405
He sent another researcher
to secretly record evidence

47:45.739 --> 47:48.617
that local police
officials were doing
Silvercorp's bidding.

47:49.200 --> 47:52.621
He would use the videos
as leverage to try
and keep Kun out of jail.

48:42.629 --> 48:46.299
Kun:

49:08.613 --> 49:10.031
Narrator:
Kun had made secret videos

49:10.198 --> 49:11.867
of Silvercorp's
under performing mines,

49:12.450 --> 49:14.327
and some of the local officials
they had bribed.

49:15.244 --> 49:17.664
He was detained briefly
twice in late 2011,

49:18.373 --> 49:20.041
and officials promised
to leave him alone

49:20.249 --> 49:21.959
if he would expose
and denounce Alfred Little.

49:23.044 --> 49:25.129
He refused,
and later that year,

49:25.338 --> 49:28.049
he was stopped at the border
as he tried to flee
to Hong Kong.

51:18.326 --> 51:21.078
Dan: What...
how many shares short am I?

51:26.668 --> 51:27.627
No shit.

51:27.961 --> 51:29.086
Hmm.

51:30.588 --> 51:32.799
Narrator:
Before Jon was exposed
as Alfred Little,

51:33.090 --> 51:34.467
Dan thought he was a crackpot.

51:34.592 --> 51:35.802
Jon: Hey...

51:36.218 --> 51:37.804
Narrator: Now, along
with Carson, Matt, and Soren,

51:38.220 --> 51:39.388
they're part of
a loose-knit tribe.

51:40.640 --> 51:43.267
Activist short sellers chasing
down frauds in China.

51:44.477 --> 51:45.520
Most of them are realists,

51:46.187 --> 51:48.314
believing the market finds
the truth on its own.

51:49.649 --> 51:50.817
Dan is different.

51:51.901 --> 51:52.986
He takes it personally.

51:55.279 --> 51:57.991
Jon: Kun keeps going to
the psychologist once a week.

51:59.951 --> 52:01.661
That was a great thing
you did, though...

52:03.496 --> 52:04.455
Not cutting him loose.

52:05.874 --> 52:07.625
Taking care of him
while he was over there.

52:09.752 --> 52:11.587
How many of these other guys
we know would've
just cut him loose.

52:12.755 --> 52:13.756
We owe him a lot.

52:15.383 --> 52:17.052
Narrator:
Kun's imprisonment changed Dan.

52:17.844 --> 52:18.970
As far as he was concerned,

52:19.554 --> 52:22.015
this wasn't about
just uncovering frauds anymore.

52:22.974 --> 52:24.475
It was about right and wrong.

52:27.020 --> 52:28.312
His friend had gone to jail,

52:28.938 --> 52:30.481
and millions of people
were being ripped off.

52:31.066 --> 52:32.567
He wanted government action,

52:32.817 --> 52:34.069
even if it meant
putting himself

52:34.318 --> 52:35.862
and the other shorts
out of business.

52:36.529 --> 52:39.032
So he hired a lobbyist and came
up with a plan to try

52:39.198 --> 52:40.575
and make Congress
pay attention.

52:41.659 --> 52:44.453
Both Toomey and Casey, are
on the Senate Finance Committee.

52:45.121 --> 52:46.622
Mm-hmm.
So what I was asking for is

52:46.873 --> 52:48.290
a Senate Finance hearing.

52:48.624 --> 52:50.251
You're, you're talking
to staffers who bounce

52:50.418 --> 52:51.961
from meeting to meeting
to meeting to meeting
to meeting.

52:52.128 --> 52:53.880
So I think a lot
of people don't even know,
this really happened.

52:54.171 --> 52:55.673
Anyone I talked to,
anyone even involved

52:55.840 --> 52:56.841
in the stock market,
doesn't even know.

52:57.008 --> 52:57.926
A lot of people don't know.

52:58.051 --> 52:59.385
So here's the frustrating part.

52:59.594 --> 53:02.055
It was the first meeting
that we had with Toomey's staff.

53:02.430 --> 53:05.808
Um, he, he actually suggested,
after an hour and a half,

53:06.101 --> 53:07.602
a letter-writing campaign.
Right.

53:07.894 --> 53:10.813
Number one, you know,
welcome to 2016.

53:11.773 --> 53:13.900
Um,
but I guess those still work.

53:14.233 --> 53:16.527
Two, I spent an hour explaining
to him,

53:17.153 --> 53:18.654
that nobody knows
they're being ripped off.

53:19.321 --> 53:21.032
How do I get people
to write a letter

53:21.323 --> 53:22.742
about what they don't know
is happening?

53:22.951 --> 53:26.328
If we give up, you know
what happens out of Washington,
nothing.

53:27.038 --> 53:29.082
You have to be at the hearing.
You have to consider yourself
an expert.

53:29.290 --> 53:30.291
That's why we're going
to Washington,

53:30.499 --> 53:31.333
That's where we're trying
to effect change.

53:34.629 --> 53:36.338
It's a very frustrating thing.
Mm-hmm.

53:36.672 --> 53:37.423
And I just...

53:39.467 --> 53:41.427
don't want to hear how
the world works anymore.

53:49.978 --> 53:50.979
Narrator: Dan had a plan.

53:55.316 --> 53:57.735
There was a Senate hearing
on whether or not
the Chinese economy

53:58.111 --> 53:59.946
poses a strategic danger
to our economy.

54:01.072 --> 54:03.992
He'd use it as
an opportunity to meet
with his senator Toomey.

54:04.450 --> 54:06.202
And get him to listen
to his concerns.

54:06.494 --> 54:07.662
Would you vote for him
at this point?

54:08.579 --> 54:10.289
How'd I vote?
Oh, right, right.

54:10.539 --> 54:12.416
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm having a casual conversation

54:12.625 --> 54:13.626
with you and I forget.

54:15.670 --> 54:17.546
Well, let me just say this,
I won't vote

54:17.713 --> 54:18.547
for the motherfucker.

54:32.728 --> 54:34.814
Dan: I think that there are
a great many people

54:35.148 --> 54:36.816
that it's their job
to give a shit.

54:37.483 --> 54:40.444
If you're going to run
for office on the idea

54:40.695 --> 54:43.781
that you're there to protect
citizens'interests...

54:45.200 --> 54:48.911
The rights of citizens,
then you should do your job.

54:49.245 --> 54:50.079
Thank you, sir.

54:51.330 --> 54:53.208
Or let somebody else do it,
that will do it.

55:14.020 --> 55:16.231
Shelby: Today, the Committee
will hear testimony

55:16.564 --> 55:19.358
on the Chinese economy
and the risk it may pose

55:19.650 --> 55:20.609
to the United States.

55:21.527 --> 55:23.821
Some believe
that China's economic stimulus,

55:24.072 --> 55:26.699
following the 2008
financial crisis,

55:27.116 --> 55:28.910
has left the financial system

55:29.244 --> 55:31.996
with an unusually high
percentage of bad debts.

55:32.288 --> 55:35.416
China's not transitioned, uh,
to a market economy.

55:35.583 --> 55:37.418
It's not lived up
to the commitments it made

55:37.668 --> 55:39.420
when it joined
the World Trade Organization.

55:39.628 --> 55:41.463
Chinese government props
up its state-owned enterprises,

55:41.672 --> 55:43.216
also called SOEs,

55:43.632 --> 55:46.844
and designated private firms,
while limiting market access

55:47.095 --> 55:48.429
for U.S.
and other foreign firms.

55:49.597 --> 55:51.266
Narrator: Dan had hoped
that Senator Toomey

55:51.432 --> 55:53.392
would address some of
the questions he'd raised
with his staff.

55:55.019 --> 55:56.145
But he left the hearing early.

55:57.688 --> 55:59.232
And it went downhill
from there.

56:00.024 --> 56:04.028
I'm not sure that I see this
as something that we really need

56:04.320 --> 56:05.362
to be too worried about.

56:05.571 --> 56:07.489
What we do need
to be worried about more,

56:08.116 --> 56:11.535
is the continuation
of the imbalances in China

56:11.994 --> 56:13.579
and what that might imply...

56:20.753 --> 56:23.172
How fast is
the Chinese economy growing?

56:23.798 --> 56:26.884
I don't know exactly.
We don't have reliable figures.

56:27.176 --> 56:28.261
Desmond: You know,
I pretty much agree

56:28.469 --> 56:31.055
that China's not growing
at 6.7 percent.

56:31.555 --> 56:33.682
It's rather growing
at something, uh,
like 4 percent.

56:34.267 --> 56:37.353
So, if the Chinese
credit bubble pops,

56:38.187 --> 56:39.939
whether it's sooner or later,

56:40.564 --> 56:43.192
dragging the Chinese economy
down with it,

56:43.484 --> 56:46.612
what kinds of vulnerabilities
might we see?

56:46.821 --> 56:50.491
I don't see the impact as being
through direct exposure

56:50.741 --> 56:53.244
of United States companies...
So, so you're not worried

56:53.535 --> 56:56.122
about the exposure
through derivatives

56:56.331 --> 56:58.166
that, for example,
put our banks,

56:59.292 --> 57:02.628
deeply engaged on the question
of commodity prices

57:02.837 --> 57:05.006
or other financial
transactions more direct?

57:05.298 --> 57:07.675
Not through China itself...

57:15.016 --> 57:17.768
I'm Dan David.
I believe Tom gave you
my book there.

57:18.102 --> 57:19.145
Oh, yes.
Yeah.

57:19.395 --> 57:20.188
I'll believe you'll find that--

57:20.355 --> 57:21.189
"The China Hustle."

57:21.314 --> 57:23.065
That's right. That's right.

57:23.607 --> 57:24.984
If you, uh, read that
and you're interested,

57:25.151 --> 57:26.819
I'd love to talk
to you about it.

57:26.986 --> 57:29.364
Okay.
So, couple of hundred billion
in fraud, and it continues.

57:30.239 --> 57:31.949
It's not over.
It goes on every day.

57:32.241 --> 57:33.450
Great.
Yeah, any one of them.

57:36.996 --> 57:38.789
Dan: Very cursory and...

57:39.123 --> 57:40.916
Okay.
...dismissive and generic.

57:41.500 --> 57:42.668
Anecdotal.
The only thing I heard

57:42.877 --> 57:44.879
at the end
was Shelby saying, uh,

57:45.171 --> 57:46.630
you know, we got
to face reality.

57:47.464 --> 57:48.924
That was it.
Okay, the reality is,

57:49.091 --> 57:50.801
they're gonna do nothing
about it.
Right.

57:51.719 --> 57:54.347
The biggest, eh, you know,
you can guarantee losing

57:54.847 --> 57:56.307
by not doing anything.
Dan: That's right.

58:01.770 --> 58:03.356
Man: Uh, why did you come down
to Washington?

58:04.523 --> 58:06.859
Dan: I was hoping
to move the ball forward,

58:07.526 --> 58:08.986
advocating
for investors'rights,

58:09.278 --> 58:12.323
to... show up and see
what's actually done

58:12.614 --> 58:13.490
at a committee hearing.

58:14.783 --> 58:16.160
Man:
What happened at the hearing?

58:16.952 --> 58:17.786
Not much.

58:23.792 --> 58:26.087
Jon: I think
that what Dan's doing to try

58:26.295 --> 58:30.507
to get Congress to take action,
is a good thing.

58:32.093 --> 58:34.511
Do I think that's the way
to solve the problem? No.

58:35.512 --> 58:36.513
I don't think so.

58:38.766 --> 58:41.143
The entire staff of
the SEC hasn't busted,

58:41.685 --> 58:43.145
more than one or two
of these frauds.

58:44.021 --> 58:46.023
A handful of short sellers
have busted,

58:46.232 --> 58:47.442
forty or fifty of these frauds.

58:58.535 --> 58:59.745
Dan: Coach, you need one?

59:00.162 --> 59:02.081
Yeah, I guess so.
Is he still living out
in France?

59:02.915 --> 59:04.583
Dan: Excuse me, ladies,
can I get you anything?

59:05.000 --> 59:06.043
Soda, water, beer?

59:07.420 --> 59:09.004
Pop, can you get Sean a beer?

59:10.005 --> 59:11.924
No, he can help himself.

59:12.216 --> 59:13.008
He's a big guy.

59:13.384 --> 59:15.844
Uh-huh.

59:16.220 --> 59:17.679
Dan: Geo Investing.
Man: G-O?

59:18.139 --> 59:19.014
Dan: G-E-O.

59:21.100 --> 59:22.643
Dan: I'll bet against them.

59:22.935 --> 59:24.812
And I'll write a report,
and I'll publish it.

59:25.562 --> 59:28.107
And I'll say they're a fraud
and I'm short.

59:29.275 --> 59:30.609
But when they do go to zero,

59:31.319 --> 59:34.029
I win, but you all lose.

59:34.822 --> 59:35.739
We're losing our ass.

59:36.698 --> 59:38.200
Started out good.
We didn't get any...

59:38.326 --> 59:40.495
Dan: This is the skim that comes
out of everybody's account.

59:41.329 --> 59:42.497
It's pennies from everyone...

59:43.914 --> 59:46.083
that adds up
to hundreds of billions.

59:46.959 --> 59:49.378
So you're campaigning
to get something to happen.

59:50.754 --> 59:52.381
Dan: So that I won't
make money anymore.

59:53.424 --> 59:54.633
You're a good man, Danny.
Yeah.

59:54.800 --> 59:55.968
I always thought
you were like that.

59:56.135 --> 59:57.594
No, you didn't.

59:57.761 --> 01:00:00.264
And I'm not. I'm not. I'm not.
It just...

01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:02.641
just doesn't sit well,
that's all.

01:00:03.892 --> 01:00:06.061
Explain to me again,
why you make money and we don't.

01:00:06.645 --> 01:00:08.230
You bet against them.
That's short them.

01:00:09.357 --> 01:00:10.358
Okay.

01:00:12.067 --> 01:00:13.861
Graduating with a 1.6...

01:00:18.449 --> 01:00:20.075
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
Dan: There's two things there.

01:00:20.242 --> 01:00:22.119
Dan: One, I had no idea
I actually graduated.

01:00:26.748 --> 01:00:27.749
Carol read something

01:00:28.834 --> 01:00:31.504
about something going on
in China right now,

01:00:31.712 --> 01:00:35.550
where they've discovered
what they think to be aliens.

01:00:36.175 --> 01:00:37.676
Wasn't it deep down,
they found 'em?

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:41.847
Well, that would be
a new wrinkle.

01:00:42.764 --> 01:00:44.850
Well, that would make
what I've been doing
the last three years a waste.

01:00:45.226 --> 01:00:46.435
Nothin'.

01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:48.563
Thousands of years ago.
Yeah.

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.773
Yup, I think he might not
come home in one piece.

01:01:00.741 --> 01:01:03.660
Jim: At the end of the day,
investors counting on the SEC

01:01:04.579 --> 01:01:09.542
to save them from their own lack
of due diligence, or greed,

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.335
are kidding themselves.

01:01:12.044 --> 01:01:14.255
Mitch: We have more opportunity
in our markets than anywhere
in the world.

01:01:14.713 --> 01:01:16.215
But, at the same time,

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:20.428
we don't have a regulator
that looks over our, our filings

01:01:20.553 --> 01:01:22.721
and says,"I want to protect
the public from this."

01:01:24.223 --> 01:01:26.016
Our system... you know,
we file with the SEC,

01:01:26.225 --> 01:01:27.935
and the SEC reads
the disclosure,
and they comment

01:01:28.143 --> 01:01:29.728
on, on the disclosure.

01:01:30.062 --> 01:01:31.522
They don't determine
whether it's viable
to be public or not.

01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:32.940
They don't make
that determination.

01:01:33.148 --> 01:01:34.942
They let the free market make
the determination.

01:01:36.235 --> 01:01:38.362
Warren:
The SEC should do its job.

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:40.948
Your job is to look out
for investors,

01:01:41.156 --> 01:01:43.659
but you've put the interests
of the Chamber of Commerce

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:45.661
and their big-business members

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:48.247
at the top
of your priority list.

01:01:49.373 --> 01:01:52.000
Narrator: It is the SEC's job
to protect investors.

01:01:52.627 --> 01:01:54.462
But it was chartered
in the 1930s,

01:01:55.254 --> 01:01:57.465
at a time when stock prices
rolled off of ticker tape

01:01:58.132 --> 01:01:59.341
and the markets closed at four.

01:02:00.384 --> 01:02:02.553
Now, they're outgunned
and outmanned,

01:02:02.928 --> 01:02:05.640
like Keystone Cops chasing
the starship"Enterprise."

01:02:06.599 --> 01:02:09.477
Even if the SEC
gets its entire wish list

01:02:09.768 --> 01:02:11.019
of documents from the company

01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:13.564
and they have enough evidence
to pursue a case,

01:02:13.855 --> 01:02:17.151
the Chinese people responsible
for this, don't really care.

01:02:17.443 --> 01:02:18.819
Dan: When somebody breaks
the law here,

01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:22.197
there is a process
where they're accountable.

01:02:22.615 --> 01:02:24.533
At some point
in a China-based company,

01:02:24.908 --> 01:02:26.285
that accountability ends.

01:02:27.077 --> 01:02:28.663
And it ends at the ocean.

01:02:28.954 --> 01:02:31.332
Narrator: This is one of
the first things
that Dan ever told me.

01:02:31.957 --> 01:02:34.960
In China, it's not illegal to
steal from foreign investors.

01:02:37.129 --> 01:02:39.423
I couldn't believe
the SEC would allow companies

01:02:39.715 --> 01:02:42.134
to list on U.S. markets,
if it really had no way

01:02:42.343 --> 01:02:43.552
to police them.

01:02:44.345 --> 01:02:47.014
So I found an employee
of the Chinese
state financial news agency,

01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:49.808
who was willing to take a risk
to confirm the truth.

01:03:30.015 --> 01:03:31.058
Bottom line is,

01:03:31.475 --> 01:03:33.268
the Chinese government
and the U.S. government,

01:03:33.602 --> 01:03:36.146
on most levels,
don't work that well together.

01:03:38.399 --> 01:03:40.192
Dan: You can't compel somebody

01:03:40.901 --> 01:03:43.153
that has stolen millions
and millions of dollars

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:46.532
from U.S. investors
to come here from China.

01:03:47.949 --> 01:03:49.660
You can't compel them
to testify.

01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:52.829
You can't even find them.

01:03:53.914 --> 01:03:55.332
Dan: Forget about
the average person

01:03:55.499 --> 01:03:57.793
who thinks that their broker
or the SEC will protect them.

01:03:58.753 --> 01:04:00.254
Even someone
like Crocker Coulson,

01:04:00.713 --> 01:04:03.131
who worked inside the system,
couldn't find out

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:05.551
what was really going on
with these Chinese companies.

01:04:06.051 --> 01:04:07.428
Crocker: You're in
an alternate universe.

01:04:07.678 --> 01:04:08.679
There's kind of this arms race

01:04:08.929 --> 01:04:10.431
to do the simplest things.

01:04:10.681 --> 01:04:12.266
You can't even look
at the bank statement.

01:04:12.474 --> 01:04:14.976
You can't even go into
the local bank and ask them.

01:04:15.436 --> 01:04:17.646
A lot of times,
the manager of the local bank,

01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:20.232
will actually reprogram
the books of the bank

01:04:20.482 --> 01:04:22.901
to make it look like the books
of his client are better
than they are.

01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:27.155
Gregory: Anytime you have
a country like China,

01:04:27.406 --> 01:04:29.617
where information
is not easily obtained,

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:33.870
any society like that
is a much greater risk.

01:04:34.246 --> 01:04:36.665
In the United States,
we can go directly to a firm

01:04:36.873 --> 01:04:38.875
and we can subpoena
those records.

01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:41.211
To get records out of China
is significantly more difficult,

01:04:41.503 --> 01:04:42.797
if not impossible.

01:04:44.172 --> 01:04:46.592
If you wanted to set out
to be a criminal,

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:48.885
probably the best place
to be a criminal

01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:52.347
is someplace with no cops,
and that was China.

01:04:52.598 --> 01:04:54.182
It was the Wild West.

01:05:32.971 --> 01:05:35.932
I am delivered.
I'm at the airport.

01:05:36.851 --> 01:05:38.435
Just headin'to the hotel.

01:05:49.905 --> 01:05:52.115
Narrator:
Dan was like Nicolas Cage
in that movie

01:05:52.324 --> 01:05:55.118
where he's the only one
who knows that
the world is going to end.

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:58.288
He's screaming about it,
but nobody cares.

01:06:00.374 --> 01:06:03.960
The auditors, the bankers,
Congress, the SEC...

01:06:05.587 --> 01:06:06.922
None of them see
the financial tsunami

01:06:07.088 --> 01:06:08.965
that Dan sees
coming from China.

01:06:10.801 --> 01:06:13.053
So he decides to do
the one thing he can do,

01:06:13.804 --> 01:06:15.013
take the criminals'money.

01:06:28.276 --> 01:06:30.487
Dan: Their share count
has ballooned,

01:06:31.071 --> 01:06:33.990
from a whopping 4.9 billion
shares four years ago

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:36.993
to 6.5 billion shares today.

01:06:37.369 --> 01:06:39.371
It appears that the only way
that they can continue

01:06:39.621 --> 01:06:41.039
to sustain
their business operation,

01:06:41.289 --> 01:06:42.708
is through dilutive financing.

01:06:48.672 --> 01:06:51.174
Narrator: Normally,
Dan publishes
his reports online.

01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:54.219
But this time,
there's too much at stake,

01:06:54.762 --> 01:06:57.681
a nearly $2 billion company,
Tech Pro.

01:06:58.724 --> 01:06:59.934
He believes
the company's chairman,

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:02.018
is misallocating
shareholder money

01:07:02.269 --> 01:07:03.604
to lavish on pet projects.

01:07:04.396 --> 01:07:06.774
If he can convince the markets,
he'll wipe the company out.

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:09.109
It'll be his
biggest short ever.

01:07:10.193 --> 01:07:11.946
Dan: Now, I don't know
what that tells anybody else,

01:07:12.237 --> 01:07:13.948
but, there's something going
on here.

01:07:15.073 --> 01:07:17.910
Our due diligence,
is a lot of black smoke,

01:07:18.452 --> 01:07:20.955
lot of black smoke
coming out of this company.

01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:22.122
That's a fire.

01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:25.918
That needs to be looked into.

01:07:59.868 --> 01:08:01.870
? To change the world?

01:08:02.370 --> 01:08:04.289
? I want to?

01:08:04.581 --> 01:08:06.082
Joining us on the floor
of the exchange right now,

01:08:06.374 --> 01:08:07.751
Dan David. He's co-founder

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:10.420
of due-diligence firm,
GeoInvesting.

01:08:10.712 --> 01:08:12.547
And I see here,
you also specialize in China?

01:08:13.131 --> 01:08:15.133
We do.
My Sohn presentation in June

01:08:15.342 --> 01:08:18.136
on Tech Pro,
Tech Pro's down 91 percent.

01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:20.263
Woman Host: Is it vindication
for you when you see a stock

01:08:20.388 --> 01:08:22.223
like that plummet?
Well, it was inevitable.

01:08:22.515 --> 01:08:24.475
I... The stock was always going
to plummet.

01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:27.938
Are you bullish
on China at all or is it just...

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:33.861
Dan: What is capitalism?

01:08:36.863 --> 01:08:39.033
Is it an economic system?

01:08:39.533 --> 01:08:42.703
Or is it an apparatus
that we can use

01:08:42.911 --> 01:08:46.331
to make more money
for ourselves and take
more money from others?

01:08:49.501 --> 01:08:53.546
At its heart,
it rewards those who work hard,

01:08:54.381 --> 01:08:57.091
but it also rewards those
who are willing

01:08:57.384 --> 01:08:59.135
to take advantage of others.

01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:14.984
Narrator: When we describe
a fraud like this one,

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:17.696
we use terms like
"white-collar crime"

01:09:17.946 --> 01:09:19.031
to distinguish it.

01:09:22.242 --> 01:09:24.202
But really, it's just theft,

01:09:25.245 --> 01:09:27.497
in its way, as violent
as being mugged in the street.

01:09:30.751 --> 01:09:33.252
It can be traumatic to chart
the trail of personal loss.

01:09:35.589 --> 01:09:37.883
How much was stolen
from each pension fund,

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:39.634
each retirement fund,

01:09:41.011 --> 01:09:42.054
each of us.

01:09:44.555 --> 01:09:47.600
Soren: The real story
is the aggregate value.

01:09:48.475 --> 01:09:52.147
It's the investors who,
by the end,
were mostly retail investors.

01:09:52.439 --> 01:09:55.067
These were mostly
just people playing
the American stock market,

01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:57.652
who looked at the financials
and believed them.

01:09:58.862 --> 01:10:00.864
Alexandra: That money is money
that belonged

01:10:01.115 --> 01:10:03.784
to individual
mom-and-pop investors

01:10:04.076 --> 01:10:07.955
who thought,"Hey, I want to be
a part of
the China growth story."

01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:10.832
And they were also shares
that belonged

01:10:11.083 --> 01:10:12.626
to mutual funds, like Vanguard,

01:10:13.418 --> 01:10:16.504
that manage money for,
for example, The New York Times,

01:10:16.964 --> 01:10:18.381
right?
The employees.

01:10:18.966 --> 01:10:20.383
My pension fund money.

01:10:21.384 --> 01:10:25.139
Roddy: We sold ourselves
on a myth of China

01:10:25.346 --> 01:10:27.808
as a really compelling market.

01:10:28.183 --> 01:10:30.644
A nation that wanted
the leveling effects

01:10:30.811 --> 01:10:32.020
of free trade.

01:10:34.148 --> 01:10:35.273
Matt: You should
have known better.

01:10:35.565 --> 01:10:36.817
Man: Well, what I would pay,

01:10:37.109 --> 01:10:38.401
if I have my money in Fidelity,

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:39.820
isn't that...
why do I pay these guys?

01:10:40.112 --> 01:10:41.155
I don't know. I don't pay 'em.

01:10:41.362 --> 01:10:42.614
I don't give 'em any
of my money.

01:10:45.366 --> 01:10:47.368
It's like a game
of musical chairs,

01:10:47.744 --> 01:10:48.996
when the music stops,

01:10:49.204 --> 01:10:50.956
if you're left holding
the paper,

01:10:51.372 --> 01:10:52.791
if you're left holding
the shares,

01:10:53.374 --> 01:10:54.292
you are the victim.

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:03.135
Okay, um, my name is David Yee,

01:11:03.802 --> 01:11:05.095
and I live in Atlanta, Georgia.

01:11:05.971 --> 01:11:07.472
My name is Ray Snader.

01:11:07.889 --> 01:11:10.100
I'm a print and broadcast
journalist

01:11:10.475 --> 01:11:12.435
in Newport, Tennessee.

01:11:12.811 --> 01:11:16.439
Tom Snodgrass
from, uh, Spring, Texas.

01:11:17.482 --> 01:11:19.693
David: What attracted me
to U.S.-listed Chinese stocks,

01:11:19.985 --> 01:11:21.111
were the high returns.

01:11:21.402 --> 01:11:23.030
There was a lot of hype
about them and

01:11:23.321 --> 01:11:24.239
a lot of attention.

01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:28.869
I was hoping to have
a nice retirement egg

01:11:29.077 --> 01:11:30.411
for my wife and myself.

01:11:31.579 --> 01:11:34.833
I do not have
a retirement plan at my job.

01:11:35.583 --> 01:11:38.419
My wife doesn't have
a retirement plan at her job.

01:11:39.504 --> 01:11:43.050
Roth Capital, issued
a buy recommendation.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.386
The first company that really
kind of caught my eye,

01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:48.222
was AgFeed.
Allegedly they were

01:11:48.429 --> 01:11:51.349
the largest
feed producer in China.

01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:55.645
My last shares,
that I purchased,

01:11:55.854 --> 01:11:57.397
were $9 a share.

01:12:01.442 --> 01:12:05.197
We recouped...12 cents
on the share.

01:12:06.031 --> 01:12:10.326
And, we had a total
of about 26,000 shares.

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:14.581
Man: What kind of loss did
that represent for you,
personally?

01:12:15.874 --> 01:12:17.167
It represented,

01:12:17.667 --> 01:12:19.335
about a $150,000.

01:12:21.213 --> 01:12:25.092
I think I lost well,
well in excess of a $100,000.

01:12:25.425 --> 01:12:27.635
My investment in these
U.S. listed Chinese companies,

01:12:27.802 --> 01:12:30.513
represented at least 50 percent
of my assets.

01:12:31.139 --> 01:12:32.682
The prices tanked,

01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:37.187
and they were eventually, um,
delisted and not tradable.

01:12:38.313 --> 01:12:41.108
Man: Worth zero.
Worth $0 per share.

01:12:41.233 --> 01:12:44.652
We put our faith in the market,

01:12:45.305 --> 01:12:51.291
