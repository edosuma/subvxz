- Shut the fuck up.

00:28.112 --> 00:32.199
You know
my men will find us.

00:32.199 --> 00:34.243
And when they do,

00:34.243 --> 00:37.329
I will bury you out here
in the desert.

00:37.329 --> 00:39.707

<i>I used to think</i>

00:42.501 --> 00:45.045
<i>there was
no such thing as ghosts.</i>

00:45.045 --> 00:47.006
<i>Then I heard a story.</i>

00:47.006 --> 00:50.176
<i>An old story.</i>

00:50.176 --> 00:52.261
<i>It goes like this:</i>

00:52.261 --> 00:53.971
<i></i> Once
upon a time there was a man...

00:54.305 --> 00:56.348

01:01.437 --> 01:03.814
...a house.

02:00.913 --> 02:03.290
How about a joke?

02:04.834 --> 02:10.297
An old man sits in a chair
telling a joke.

02:18.722 --> 02:21.267
It's a German joke.

02:21.267 --> 02:23.978
- Were you calling me?
- Huh?

02:34.280 --> 02:36.115
What did you say?

02:36.115 --> 02:38.450
I... I didn't say anything.

02:38.450 --> 02:40.661
Oh.

02:40.661 --> 02:44.373
I... thought I heard something.

02:50.462 --> 02:53.382
Oh. I... I was telling a joke.

02:55.134 --> 02:58.429
No one wants to hear your jokes.

02:59.430 --> 03:02.308
Isn't that right, hmm?

03:03.309 --> 03:04.602
Ooh. Huh.

03:05.603 --> 03:07.062
It's snowing.

03:08.272 --> 03:09.273
Huh.

03:10.441 --> 03:14.194
Marlene was my favorite.

03:14.194 --> 03:17.239
I used to use a hairbrush
as a microphone

03:17.239 --> 03:21.911
and pretend I was in a...
a cabaret, you know?

04:18.759 --> 04:20.511

This is Obersturmführer Luntz.

We are sorry to intrude
like this unannounced,

but may we come in?

06:22.591 --> 06:26.845
I'm sorry, but... but
I'm having trouble hearing.

Why don't you boys
just come inside?

06:37.981 --> 06:40.734
- Smells like flowers.
- Mm-hmm.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.821
The smell of flowers
makes me have to shit.

06:43.821 --> 06:45.072
Quiet.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.783
Come. Come, come. Hmm?

Come sit.

Some boys are here to see us.

Hello.

Hallo.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.649
Herr Hansöm. Frau Hansöm.

07:20.649 --> 07:23.026
It's a privilege
to meet you both.

07:23.026 --> 07:26.405
- What did you say, son?
- What did you say, dear?

07:26.405 --> 07:29.032
- I said, "What did he say?"
- I didn't say anything.

07:29.032 --> 07:32.202
I said it's a privilege
to meet you, sir.

07:32.202 --> 07:35.789
You have designed halls
and castles for the Reich

07:35.789 --> 07:37.833
worthy of God himself.

07:37.833 --> 07:41.170
May they live on forever,
as may our Führer.

07:41.170 --> 07:43.589
Sieg Heil.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.341
When did you move in here,
Herr Hansöm?

07:46.341 --> 07:49.553
Move in? We built it ourselves.

07:49.553 --> 07:53.682
We gave life to this house.
We birthed it.

07:53.682 --> 07:56.685
- 30 years ago.
- 29 years ago.

07:56.685 --> 07:58.729
It was 30, Helga.

08:25.255 --> 08:28.008

08:28.008 --> 08:31.220

08:31.220 --> 08:33.347
But ask it still I must.

08:33.347 --> 08:36.183
We received a tip
to our intelligence service,

08:36.183 --> 08:41.813
and I must ask as delicately
and respectfully as I can...

08:42.814 --> 08:48.654
...is there anyone else

08:58.247 --> 09:00.332
No, uh...

- Darling, wait...
- I must.

09:02.960 --> 09:05.128
We cannot lie.

09:10.092 --> 09:13.720
We are harboring others
in this house.

09:17.140 --> 09:20.143
Can they hear us right now?

09:20.143 --> 09:22.354
I believe they can.

09:22.354 --> 09:24.648
How many of them are there?

09:24.648 --> 09:27.025
Oh, it's hard to tell.

09:27.025 --> 09:28.277
What's hard about it?

09:28.277 --> 09:30.779
- They come and they go.
- Hmm.

09:30.779 --> 09:32.322
Where are they now?

09:32.322 --> 09:35.200
Oh, in the walls.

09:37.369 --> 09:39.746
Beneath the floorboards.

09:41.039 --> 09:43.125
In the ceiling.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.213
How long have they
been here for?

09:48.213 --> 09:51.258
- 30 years.
- 29.

09:51.258 --> 09:55.637
But... the war started
only four years ago.

09:55.637 --> 09:58.765
Well, what does the war
have to do with them?

09:58.765 --> 10:01.852
What doesn't the war
have to do with the Jews?

10:01.852 --> 10:03.937
Jews?

10:06.148 --> 10:09.401
There are no Jews in this house.

10:11.403 --> 10:14.740
Then who on Earth is
"in the walls,

10:14.740 --> 10:18.160
beneath the floorboards,
and in the ceiling"?

10:18.160 --> 10:19.369
Oh...

10:19.369 --> 10:21.872
Ghosts, dear.

10:21.872 --> 10:25.542
There are ghosts in this house.

10:25.542 --> 10:28.378
We hear them every night.

10:28.378 --> 10:32.299
Whispering strange melodies.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.885
Laughing at strange jokes.

Herr Hansöm,
my colleagues

10:37.637 --> 10:41.141
and I are not in
the business of apparitions.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.477

of Jew hunting.

10:43.477 --> 10:44.728

hiding in this home.

10:50.067 --> 10:52.486

10:52.486 --> 10:54.446
Jews.

10:54.446 --> 10:56.865
Jews? Here?

10:56.865 --> 10:59.701

might have gotten in,

11:05.624 --> 11:06.917
by all means,

11:06.917 --> 11:09.002

11:09.002 --> 11:10.420
Oh, <i>ja.</i>

11:12.547 --> 11:16.927

we are here to investigate

11:16.927 --> 11:21.098

active participation

11:21.098 --> 11:22.474

11:23.767 --> 11:29.606
A Frau Olga Hiddenbrau

11:29.606 --> 11:33.235
picked up from the market
three whole ducks.

11:33.235 --> 11:36.655
That's a lot of birds

11:41.368 --> 11:43.161
Yes, of course.

11:43.161 --> 11:45.205

11:45.205 --> 11:47.791
I seldom leave this house,

11:47.791 --> 11:53.380

and freeze them in the ice box.

12:02.514 --> 12:03.932
Well.

12:03.932 --> 12:08.728
Do you mind if
we have a... a look around?

You know, I, uh...

13:23.720 --> 13:28.058

15:44.486 --> 15:45.779
Do you have
grandchildren?

15:45.779 --> 15:48.114
Oh, no, dear.

15:52.243 --> 15:53.578
Do you have children?

15:53.578 --> 15:54.663
Uh...

15:56.122 --> 16:01.086
We had a child. Once.

16:01.086 --> 16:06.800
I-I built him
this beautiful crib.

16:06.800 --> 16:10.428
I... I... I carved it myself.

16:10.428 --> 16:14.683
Carved these little
animals into the wood.

16:15.767 --> 16:19.604
Lions and... bears.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.399
And sheep.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.944
Remember, Heinrich?

16:25.944 --> 16:27.946
So Hugo would sleep.

16:27.946 --> 16:30.031
- Ah.
- Hugo?

16:31.741 --> 16:33.743
That's my name.

16:34.786 --> 16:35.829
Is it?

16:35.829 --> 16:40.250
Oh,
it's a lovely name.

16:41.751 --> 16:43.503
For a lovely boy.

16:45.088 --> 16:47.632
I designed it so

16:47.632 --> 16:51.636
it would rock ever so slightly.

16:51.636 --> 16:55.932
So he would feel like
he was still in the womb.

16:58.977 --> 17:00.103
But...

17:02.021 --> 17:04.691
But he got big.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.193
As boys do.

17:08.194 --> 17:11.823
And he climbed up one night.

17:11.823 --> 17:13.408
As boys do.

17:13.408 --> 17:15.034
And, uh...

17:16.369 --> 17:18.288
...he fell back and...

17:20.373 --> 17:23.293
...and broke his neck.

17:24.961 --> 17:28.173
Helga,
he didn't fall.

17:30.008 --> 17:32.469
- The wood broke.
- Oh.

17:32.469 --> 17:34.345
From his weight.

17:34.345 --> 17:38.391
It, it wasn't sturdy enough.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.643
It was a flaw.

17:40.643 --> 17:43.313
In the design.

17:43.313 --> 17:46.608
In... my design.

17:47.859 --> 17:52.489
His crib became his coffin.

17:55.742 --> 17:59.370
We found him
the next morning.

18:00.455 --> 18:03.625
Hugo looked peaceful, Hugo.

18:03.625 --> 18:07.003
The... the crib rocking.

18:07.003 --> 18:09.214
Still rocking.

18:10.632 --> 18:14.093
I... don't know if
Helga and I were ever

18:14.093 --> 18:15.845
meant to have children.

18:18.014 --> 18:21.142
I don't know if we were
capable of looking after them.

18:25.146 --> 18:27.941
I'm so sorry.

18:29.943 --> 18:33.279
That's very kind.

18:33.279 --> 18:34.864
But...

18:34.864 --> 18:37.742

to be sorry about.

18:37.742 --> 18:38.785
No.

18:38.785 --> 18:42.413

It is to think
as an architect thinks.

22:23.259 --> 22:29.140
To think as a barn,
or a school, or a home thinks.

22:30.224 --> 22:34.937
Where could I, a home,
hide a Jew?

23:12.433 --> 23:14.435
Interesting.

23:18.564 --> 23:21.526
This is a beautiful
house you've built.

23:21.526 --> 23:24.737
From the outside it's so large.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.280
But inside...

23:27.281 --> 23:28.658
...feels smaller.

23:28.658 --> 23:30.701
Much smaller.

23:30.701 --> 23:33.371
Does it?

23:33.371 --> 23:35.832
Just a trick of the eye.

23:35.832 --> 23:38.209
Forced perspective.

23:40.044 --> 23:42.797
My eye doesn't play tricks.

23:44.340 --> 23:45.925
Does yours play tricks?

23:47.552 --> 23:48.511
On me?

23:53.891 --> 23:56.185
And, oddest of all,

23:56.185 --> 23:57.687
this wall...

23:59.188 --> 24:00.481
...this wood...

24:01.607 --> 24:03.317
...hasn't aged like the others.

24:05.528 --> 24:06.696
In fact...

24:11.450 --> 24:14.370
It feels just a few years old.

24:18.207 --> 24:19.709
A recent renovation.

24:19.709 --> 24:22.920
At my age, son?

24:22.920 --> 24:27.466
Heinrich can hardly
renovate his model homes

24:27.466 --> 24:30.720
with his arthritis.

24:31.721 --> 24:34.098
It doesn't make sense, sir.

24:34.098 --> 24:35.683
I eyed a rear retaining wall

24:35.683 --> 24:39.896
of 15 meters and yet here,
I eye only 12.

24:39.896 --> 24:41.564
As we danced, I measured.

24:41.564 --> 24:43.900
Each step, one meter.

24:46.444 --> 24:50.031
All this from
a failed architect.

24:52.783 --> 24:54.535
What are you hiding?

24:54.535 --> 24:57.288
What is behind this wall?

24:59.957 --> 25:02.877
Nothing. Only ghosts.

25:02.877 --> 25:05.296
Ghosts rule this home.

25:05.296 --> 25:08.257
They... they haunt these walls.

25:08.257 --> 25:11.427
- Oh, Heinrich.
- It's okay, Helga.

25:16.140 --> 25:18.643
You were my hero.

25:18.643 --> 25:20.978
How could you betray the Reich
by hiding Jews?

25:20.978 --> 25:24.273
Why would I hide Jews?

25:25.358 --> 25:27.485
The Reich's chief architect?

25:27.485 --> 25:33.157
I build towers and tombs,
palaces and prisons

25:33.157 --> 25:34.617
for the Führer.

25:34.617 --> 25:36.452
Structures of death.

25:36.452 --> 25:39.538
Where murder and war plot
and rest and live.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.499
Perhaps you saw
what your creations

25:41.499 --> 25:43.918
were used for,
and once, just once,

25:43.918 --> 25:49.507
you wished for one coffin
you built to instead be a crib.

25:50.967 --> 25:54.011
At my old age?

25:54.011 --> 25:57.431
My heart should turn
from its allegiance?

25:57.431 --> 25:59.350
My conscience
should... should swing

25:59.350 --> 26:01.102
like... like a weather vane?

26:01.102 --> 26:05.731
The poles of me reverse
in my 80th year?

26:06.774 --> 26:09.568
"It's never too late
to follow your heart."

26:09.568 --> 26:13.197
Heinrich...

26:14.240 --> 26:18.160
It will be okay, Helga.

26:18.160 --> 26:21.706
Hugo is not a killer.

26:23.457 --> 26:25.251
Ernst, Matthias!

26:25.251 --> 26:27.962
There is nothing
behind that wall.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.425
Only ghosts.

26:32.425 --> 26:33.467
Only Hugo.

26:33.467 --> 26:34.969
Ernst, Matthias, get down here!

26:34.969 --> 26:38.097
Son, please. What are you doing?

26:38.097 --> 26:39.890
What is behind this wall?
Tell me what's behind

26:39.890 --> 26:41.642
this wall or I will shoot!

26:41.642 --> 26:44.812
I swear, there is nothing!

26:46.731 --> 26:49.942
He is telling the truth.

27:15.509 --> 27:16.510
I...

27:17.511 --> 27:18.971
I...

27:20.806 --> 27:21.974
I'm sorry.

27:23.351 --> 27:25.269
I...

27:40.659 --> 27:42.495
The ghosts...

27:43.496 --> 27:44.872
No!

27:46.707 --> 27:48.542
Hurry, Helga!

28:02.181 --> 28:04.767
Here, Maman.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.666
Ah!

28:59.822 --> 29:02.741
Mother's home.

29:36.817 --> 29:41.780
A German man sits
in a chair telling a joke.

29:41.780 --> 29:44.408
It is funny.

29:50.873 --> 29:55.794
<i>♪ Ich bin die fesche Lola,
der Liebling der Saison ♪</i>

29:56.837 --> 29:58.464
Then you.

29:58.464 --> 30:02.051
<i>♪ Ich hab' ein Pianola

30:02.051 --> 30:03.844
Then me.

30:03.844 --> 30:08.265
<i>♪ Ich bin die fesche Lola,

30:08.265 --> 30:11.936
<i>♪ Ich bin die fesche Lola,

30:11.936 --> 30:14.522
Ah!

30:16.357 --> 30:19.610
Then you take two fingers

30:19.610 --> 30:24.031
and... move to the trap
in the wall, huh.

30:24.031 --> 30:25.658
Like so.

30:25.658 --> 30:27.535
Ah. Ha!

30:28.536 --> 30:31.497
It will take them
by total surprise.

30:33.666 --> 30:35.960
Voilà.

30:35.960 --> 30:38.087
Yes.

30:39.338 --> 30:44.677
Remember, Zev, we build these
things not because we want to

30:44.677 --> 30:46.470
but because we must.

30:47.471 --> 30:48.806
Okay, my boy?

30:49.807 --> 30:50.808
Okay.

30:52.977 --> 30:55.688
Lucky number nine.

30:59.358 --> 31:00.609
Ah!

31:02.820 --> 31:04.321
Your turn, Zev.

31:06.532 --> 31:07.950
Seven.

31:07.950 --> 31:09.493
- Ooh.
- Seven.

31:09.493 --> 31:11.495
- One, two, three...
- <i>Eins, zwei, drei...</i>

31:11.495 --> 31:13.289
- four, five, six...
- <i>vier, fünf, sechs,</i>

31:13.289 --> 31:15.416
seven.

31:16.875 --> 31:19.670
Rats!

31:22.881 --> 31:24.800
Better luck next time, my boy.

31:36.937 --> 31:38.939
Quick, Heinrich.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.236
Father's home.

32:36.413 --> 32:38.624
- <i>Ja?</i>
- Ah, Herr Hansöm.

32:38.624 --> 32:40.542
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

32:40.542 --> 32:43.545
I'm Hauptsturmführer Nabor.
This is Obersturmführer Kritz.

32:43.545 --> 32:45.464
And this is
Untersturmführer Rigard.

32:45.464 --> 32:46.715
We are coming in.

32:46.715 --> 32:48.676
Come.

33:01.438 --> 33:03.440
Would you boys
like some tea?

33:10.864 --> 33:13.575
Now, what can we do
for you boys?

33:13.575 --> 33:16.370
Herr Hansöm,
do you remember meeting

33:16.370 --> 33:19.373
Hauptsturmführer Halden,
Obersturmführer Luntz,

33:19.373 --> 33:21.792
and Untersturmführer Grimmark
one week ago?

33:21.792 --> 33:23.836
Who is that now?

33:23.836 --> 33:26.088
They are
from our <i>Judenjäger</i> unit.

33:26.088 --> 33:28.924
On Monday, May 4th,
they left their last home visit

33:28.924 --> 33:30.217
to come here.

33:30.217 --> 33:31.218
They were then scheduled

33:31.218 --> 33:32.761
to arrive at
an apartment in Leipzig,

33:32.761 --> 33:34.555
but they never made it.

33:34.555 --> 33:37.558
Our <i>Juden</i> unit likes to
give windows of their arrival.

33:37.558 --> 33:39.935
9:00 to 3:00, 12:00 to 6:00.

33:39.935 --> 33:41.603
People grow quite frustrated

33:41.603 --> 33:43.647
when they're promised a
delivery time and it's not met.

33:43.647 --> 33:45.190
And the fellow who called in

33:45.190 --> 33:47.443
the tip at the apartment
in Leipzig,

33:47.443 --> 33:49.069
he said they didn't
arrive all day.

33:49.069 --> 33:51.155
And they never made it
back to the barracks.

33:52.281 --> 33:54.533
Do you remember
seeing them here?

33:55.451 --> 33:56.994
Uh, who, son?

33:56.994 --> 33:59.163
The <i>Judenjäger</i> unit.

34:00.164 --> 34:02.916
You boys are looking
for mangy Jews?

34:02.916 --> 34:03.917
No.

34:03.917 --> 34:05.919
We are the Missing Persons Unit.

34:05.919 --> 34:09.965
We're looking for the unit
who looks for mangy Jews.

34:09.965 --> 34:12.259
But, yes, we also kill Jews.

34:19.600 --> 34:22.811
<i>Ja, ja, ja, ja.</i>
Some boys came by.

34:22.811 --> 34:24.480
Very kind boys.

34:24.480 --> 34:27.191
Very handsome lads.

34:27.191 --> 34:30.235
They searched for about,
mm, 30 minutes

34:30.235 --> 34:32.196
and then they went on their way.

34:32.196 --> 34:34.364
You know what time that was?

34:34.364 --> 34:37.576
Oh, I believe it was at 4:00.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.703
No, I think it was 4:30, dear.

34:39.703 --> 34:42.790
Because <i>Frau Zinkenfeller's
Four-o-clock Frolic</i>

34:42.790 --> 34:46.126
was just ending on the radio.

34:46.126 --> 34:48.378
- I'd say 4:00.
- 4:30.

34:48.378 --> 34:49.838
- 4:00.
- 4:30.

34:49.838 --> 34:53.133
<i>♪ 4:00, 4:30,

<i>4:00, 4:30, 4:00, 4:30 ♪</i>

35:00.224 --> 35:03.227
Herr Hansöm, Frau Hansöm,
do you mind if we look around?

35:03.227 --> 35:04.978
Oh, be our guest.

36:23.557 --> 36:26.310
I like your house.

36:27.436 --> 36:29.855
Huh. Thank you.

36:29.855 --> 36:32.232
- We do, too. Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

36:34.359 --> 36:36.278
I could see myself living here.

36:37.279 --> 36:40.198
Oh... [chuckling] Yes.

36:56.840 --> 36:59.134
We are sorry to have
wasted your time.

36:59.134 --> 37:00.761
Thank you for opening
your home to us.

37:00.761 --> 37:04.348
Of course.

37:04.348 --> 37:06.642
I-I hope you find those boys.

37:06.642 --> 37:08.185
Obersturmführer Kritz,

37:08.185 --> 37:10.771
Untersturmführer Rigard,
time to go.

37:10.771 --> 37:12.814
Thank you, Herr Hansöm,

37:12.814 --> 37:14.024
we are sorry
to have troubled you.

37:17.486 --> 37:19.154
What the fuck?!

37:19.154 --> 37:20.781
- What the fuck?!
- Oh, shit.

37:21.823 --> 37:23.158
I like the house.

37:23.158 --> 37:24.534
What the fuck?

37:25.786 --> 37:27.079
You shot them!

37:27.079 --> 37:29.581
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

37:29.581 --> 37:31.333
We couldn't go back
empty-handed.

37:31.333 --> 37:32.876
They would have had my title,

37:32.876 --> 37:34.378
they would have had
your job, Gert,

37:34.378 --> 37:36.463
and they would have
had your head, Anders.

37:36.463 --> 37:40.884
So, we make up a story that this
couple was hiding a few Jews

37:40.884 --> 37:42.886
and did kill the three
missing SS officers

37:42.886 --> 37:44.221
that caught on to them.

37:44.221 --> 37:46.390
When we arrived,
we found the Jews,

37:46.390 --> 37:48.809
murdered them, then murdered
these senile old Jew lovers,

37:48.809 --> 37:50.936
and buried them all
in the backyard.

37:50.936 --> 37:54.523
Avenging our brethren and
returning order to this town.

37:54.523 --> 37:57.025
Then I get to keep the house,

37:57.025 --> 37:59.236
which I'll move into
in one week's time,

37:59.236 --> 38:01.196
you get to keep your job,

38:01.196 --> 38:04.116
and you, Anders,
get to keep your head.

38:04.116 --> 38:06.326
But they weren't hiding
any fucking Jews.

38:06.326 --> 38:08.662
And they didn't kill
the three SS officers.

38:08.662 --> 38:10.956
- So what?
- So what?

38:10.956 --> 38:13.750
This is Heinrich Hansöm!

38:13.750 --> 38:15.627
This is
a Heinrich Hansöm house.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.295
Well.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.172
Even more reason.

38:19.172 --> 38:21.133
Can you imagine
the resale value?

38:21.133 --> 38:23.510
Tomas is right.

38:23.510 --> 38:25.012
What?

38:25.012 --> 38:27.347
The three of them have
been missing for a week.

38:27.347 --> 38:29.683
SS officers don't go missing.

38:30.726 --> 38:33.520
If we came back empty-handed,
they would have had our heads.

38:35.856 --> 38:38.025
You are a fucking psychopath.

38:41.486 --> 38:43.530
Bury the bodies
in the back garden.

38:49.494 --> 38:51.747
Hmm.

38:52.748 --> 38:54.708
I'm going to put in a pool.

39:32.079 --> 39:34.873
Ladies
and gentlemen, I present...

39:34.873 --> 39:36.583
...the house!

39:42.964 --> 39:46.676
I found you. I got you. I do!

39:48.178 --> 39:50.722
Oh, Friedrich, don't run.

39:50.722 --> 39:52.516
Oh, I beg you.

39:52.516 --> 39:55.685
Oh, come on,
he's just having fun.

40:03.193 --> 40:05.654
- Shall we go inside?
- Yes.

40:08.365 --> 40:10.117
- Oh, Tomas.
- Ah!

40:10.117 --> 40:12.119
- I love my new house.
- <i>Ja!</i>

40:13.120 --> 40:14.287
Oh, yes.

40:14.287 --> 40:15.872
Devils!

40:15.872 --> 40:16.957
I'm gonna put in a pool.

40:16.957 --> 40:18.583
Oh, it's so big.

40:18.583 --> 40:21.503
Oh, it's so huge!

40:25.757 --> 40:27.008
This duck
is delicious, my love.

40:27.008 --> 40:28.468
It tastes weird.

40:28.468 --> 40:29.970
Friedrich,
you are going to eat it.

40:29.970 --> 40:32.264
Ew,
I don't want duck.

40:32.264 --> 40:33.849
- You can't let it go
to waste.
- Fine, sweetheart.

40:33.849 --> 40:35.892
- We'll give you
applesauce instead.
- Tomas!

40:39.062 --> 40:40.981
And in the dark woods
the king and queen

40:40.981 --> 40:42.816
and their little prince found

40:42.816 --> 40:45.068
the most beautiful castle
of all.

40:45.068 --> 40:48.155
It was old and special
and fit for heroes like them,

40:48.155 --> 40:50.782
and in that castle
they found great happiness.

40:55.996 --> 40:58.290
I told you
we should've left...

40:58.290 --> 41:00.709
...when we had the chance.

41:01.042 --> 41:02.836
And go where?

41:03.378 --> 41:06.798
We are three kilometers
from the SS outpost.

41:07.382 --> 41:09.217
You don't think they'd find us?

41:11.386 --> 41:13.930
New family, new food.

41:13.930 --> 41:16.099
We take only what we need.

41:18.643 --> 41:21.062
Okay. It's time, Zev.

41:22.189 --> 41:23.481
Okay.

41:42.417 --> 41:45.921
♪ ♪

43:25.478 --> 43:27.731
Don't scream, boy, or I'll kill
your fucking family.

43:27.731 --> 43:28.940
Quick.

43:36.990 --> 43:38.658
Shh.

43:39.659 --> 43:41.244
What is he
doing here?

43:41.244 --> 43:42.203
He saw Zev.

43:42.203 --> 43:43.788
How could you be so careless?

43:43.788 --> 43:45.206
It wasn't the boy's fault.

43:45.206 --> 43:46.499
What do we do with him?

43:46.499 --> 43:49.919
If we keep him here,
he will get us all killed.

43:58.094 --> 43:59.888
We can't do that.

43:59.888 --> 44:02.223
We don't do that.

44:04.059 --> 44:06.186
I have
a better way.

44:07.604 --> 44:12.025
Friedrich.

44:13.818 --> 44:15.153
Friedrich, where are you?!

44:16.571 --> 44:19.532
Tomas, Tomas,
where's Friedrich?!

44:19.532 --> 44:20.950
What do you mean
"where's Friedrich"?

44:20.950 --> 44:23.578
He's not in his bed.
Is he with you?

44:23.578 --> 44:25.747
No.

44:25.747 --> 44:27.749
- Friedrich?
- Friedrich?

44:27.749 --> 44:29.292
Friedrich,
where are you?

44:29.292 --> 44:31.002
Friedrich!

44:35.048 --> 44:36.966
- Friedrich!
- Friedrich?

44:36.966 --> 44:38.635
- Friedrich!
- Friedrich!

44:38.635 --> 44:40.387
Come on, boy,
where are you?

44:40.387 --> 44:42.680
- Where are you?!
- Where are you?

44:42.680 --> 44:47.477
- Friedrich!
- Friedrich!

44:47.477 --> 44:50.355
Papa?

44:50.355 --> 44:52.440
Mama!

44:52.440 --> 44:54.692
- Help!
- Friedrich?
- Friedrich!

44:54.692 --> 44:56.611
Friedrich,
where are you?

44:57.737 --> 45:00.073
[screams] They took me!

45:00.073 --> 45:02.367
- Who took you?
- The Hansöms!

45:03.410 --> 45:06.454
It's because
of what you did, Papa.

45:06.454 --> 45:08.164
What is he talking about?

45:08.164 --> 45:11.709
Friedrich,
where the fuck are you?!

45:12.752 --> 45:14.629
Friedrich...

45:14.629 --> 45:17.173
My sweetheart, where are you?

45:18.258 --> 45:21.845
Closer! Closer!

45:21.845 --> 45:24.722
- Friedrich!
- Talk to Mommy!

45:24.722 --> 45:26.599
- Where are you?!
- Friedrich!

45:29.519 --> 45:31.396
Tomas!

45:31.396 --> 45:32.730
Tomas.

46:45.220 --> 46:46.930
Shabbat shalom.

46:46.930 --> 46:49.557
I miss the Hansöms
so much.

46:49.557 --> 46:53.102
I think they would be
so happy we have their house.

46:56.397 --> 46:57.941
I'd say we have two days

46:57.941 --> 47:00.902
before they start looking for
the SS officer and his family.

47:02.654 --> 47:06.366
We need to get the house
ready, just in case.

47:08.284 --> 47:11.120
I'll do it. He taught me how.

47:15.208 --> 47:16.918
Like that.

47:18.127 --> 47:19.879
Brilliant.

47:23.007 --> 47:24.759
This should do it.

47:28.555 --> 47:30.014
Give me the rope.

47:37.855 --> 47:40.817
We have to convince the
commandant we're the Rigards.

47:40.817 --> 47:43.486
Remember, let me do the talking.

47:43.486 --> 47:46.823
If he asks you a question,
let me answer for you.

47:46.823 --> 47:50.034
If he believes us,
we get to keep the house.

47:50.034 --> 47:51.661
Okay.

47:54.497 --> 47:56.416
Father's home.

48:13.808 --> 48:14.976
Thank you for coming.

48:14.976 --> 48:17.895
I didn't know who else to call.

48:17.895 --> 48:19.480
You...

48:27.697 --> 48:29.490
...did the right thing.

48:30.742 --> 48:32.285
Hauptsturmführer Reinold.

48:35.413 --> 48:36.831
Can I come in?

48:36.831 --> 48:39.042
Of course.

49:03.941 --> 49:06.027
I made it extra sweet.

49:17.997 --> 49:21.709
I... discovered
he had been having an affair.

49:24.379 --> 49:26.339
And that he was a coward.

49:28.883 --> 49:33.304
That he was afraid
the Reich was going to lose

49:33.304 --> 49:36.474
to the godforsaken Americans.

49:36.474 --> 49:38.351
And so he took off.

49:40.269 --> 49:41.187
For where?

49:41.187 --> 49:43.856
He didn't say.

49:43.856 --> 49:46.025
He didn't even kiss
the child goodbye.

49:46.025 --> 49:49.612
Isn't that right, Friedrich?

49:51.072 --> 49:53.074
<i>Ja.</i>

49:54.492 --> 49:57.078
Well, Frau Rigard.

49:58.121 --> 49:59.664
We will no doubt look
for your husband,

49:59.664 --> 50:01.541
the coward.

50:03.501 --> 50:05.253
You did the right thing
to call us.

50:07.797 --> 50:08.756
Heil Hitler.

50:10.299 --> 50:11.300
Sieg Heil.

50:12.218 --> 50:13.845
Ah!

50:15.221 --> 50:16.264
Get back here.

50:19.016 --> 50:20.601
This old house
has ghosts.

50:21.644 --> 50:23.229
Let me show you out.

50:31.112 --> 50:33.114
Stay strong, boy.

50:39.662 --> 50:41.497
Thank you again
for coming.

50:42.498 --> 50:44.625
I'm a good man, Frau Rigard.

50:45.626 --> 50:48.755
I've been very lonely since
my wife died of tuberculosis.

50:49.797 --> 50:52.717
Oh, Hauptsturmführer Reinold...

50:52.717 --> 50:54.135
I know this is all quite sudden,

50:54.135 --> 50:58.222
but clearly Herr Rigard
doesn't deserve you.

50:58.222 --> 50:59.515
And I was thinking,
sitting here,

50:59.515 --> 51:02.101
that perhaps we could make
each other's lives

51:02.101 --> 51:05.104
a little less lonely.

51:05.104 --> 51:07.106
Get back here.

51:08.608 --> 51:11.027
- Ah!
- My father was no coward.

51:11.027 --> 51:12.695
- Stop.
- Shit.

51:13.529 --> 51:15.239
- Jew!
- No!

51:17.658 --> 51:18.993
Shit.

51:20.119 --> 51:21.537
Rivka!

51:31.714 --> 51:33.132
It's time!

51:54.821 --> 51:56.948
Check under the bed.

52:05.456 --> 52:06.958
Up here!
They're getting away!

52:08.459 --> 52:09.794
Shit. Aah!

52:10.795 --> 52:13.130
Zev! Zev! Zev!

52:13.130 --> 52:15.925
Go. Now.

52:15.925 --> 52:17.969
You built something beautiful

52:17.969 --> 52:20.346
with your own hands
and your own mind.

52:20.346 --> 52:22.473
He would have been very proud.

52:22.473 --> 52:24.642
Now go, take
the children and go.

52:24.642 --> 52:27.979
Go out the back and run
into those woods. Go.

52:27.979 --> 52:30.273
Go, go. Go.

53:01.637 --> 53:04.724
It's true.

53:04.724 --> 53:06.976
I think we're ghosts.

53:08.561 --> 53:11.856
I think this is a ghost story.

53:26.162 --> 53:27.413
Wait, wait.

53:36.714 --> 53:39.634
- No one is coming.
- Shut the fuck up.

53:39.634 --> 53:43.888
My people... will find us.

54:10.206 --> 54:11.207
Come.

54:12.875 --> 54:14.168
Come on.

54:27.348 --> 54:31.560
When you made us ghosts,
you taught us how to be...

54:31.560 --> 54:33.437
invisible.

54:40.361 --> 54:41.696
This is
crazy!

54:42.530 --> 54:43.531
Crazy!

54:44.323 --> 54:45.825
This is crazy!

54:46.659 --> 54:47.618
Crazy!

54:49.620 --> 54:50.579
Crazy!

54:51.831 --> 54:52.790
Crazy!

55:06.220 --> 55:08.222
Did she know?

55:09.306 --> 55:11.517
Did Chava know that you got him?

55:11.517 --> 55:14.478
It's because of her that we did.

55:16.355 --> 55:18.649
Thank you, Zev.

55:21.777 --> 55:24.739
Thank you.
