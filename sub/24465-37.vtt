02:30.360 --> 02:31.260
Benson: WELL...

02:31.360 --> 02:32.780
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

02:32.880 --> 02:36.120
NICE TO HAVE A WAITER SERVE A
GIFT BOX IN PLACE OF DESSERT.

02:35.600 --> 02:36.780

05:59.880 --> 06:02.960
I NEED YOU TO PICK UP THE
WAFFLE CAKE AND MEET ME BY THE

06:02.120 --> 06:05.240
BIG FOUNTAIN IN TOWN SQUARE.
Eileen: I'M ON IT!

06:04.160 --> 06:05.540
Mordecai: ( PANTING )

06:05.640 --> 06:07.100
YOU'RE PRETTY FAST, MORDECAI.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.300
Mordecai: HUH?

06:08.400 --> 06:10.620
NOT FAST ENOUGH!

06:10.720 --> 06:11.620
WHOOâHOO! I WIN!

06:11.720 --> 06:13.300
Mordecai: THAT'S NOT FAIR!

06:13.400 --> 06:14.140
YOU EXERCISE.

06:14.240 --> 06:14.660
( SIGHS )

06:14.760 --> 06:16.460
LET ME JUST GET A CUP OF COFFEE.

06:16.560 --> 06:18.100
THEN I BET I CAN OUTRUN YOU.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.460

06:25.080 --> 06:27.540
Rigby: DUDE!

06:27.640 --> 06:28.940
Mordecai: OKAY, HERE I GO.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.100
I WISH...

06:30.200 --> 06:32.020
FOR A CUTE GIRLFRIEND WHO LIKES

06:32.120 --> 06:32.780
ME BACK.

06:32.880 --> 06:36.100
( BOTH LAUGH )

06:36.200 --> 06:39.620
DUMP CLOUDY J!

06:39.720 --> 06:40.620
IS HE WATCHING US?

06:40.720 --> 06:42.020
Mordecai: LET'S GET OUT OF

06:42.120 --> 06:45.720

Rigby: ( PANTING )

06:45.800 --> 06:46.660
UGH! COME ON, DUDE!

06:46.760 --> 06:47.580

06:47.680 --> 06:50.400
Eileen: RIGBY?
Rigby: EILEEN?

06:49.280 --> 06:50.540
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

06:50.640 --> 06:53.800
ARE YOU GONNA EAT THAT BY

06:52.240 --> 06:53.700
Eileen: I'M DOING A FAVOR FOR

06:53.800 --> 06:56.080

06:59.480 --> 07:02.260
Eileen: WAIT...

07:02.360 --> 07:05.480
Mordecai: I THINK WE'RE SAFE.

07:04.280 --> 07:04.900
I'M GOOD. YOU?

07:05.000 --> 07:07.560
Mordecai: NAH.
UH, I'M GONNA USE THE

07:06.480 --> 07:09.000
BATHROOM.
Mordecai: I THINK I LEFT

07:08.000 --> 07:10.300
SOMETHING AT THE FOUNTAIN.

07:10.400 --> 07:10.780
RIGBY!

07:10.880 --> 07:13.280
EILEEN!
Both: NEW PLAN.

07:12.040 --> 07:15.080

THE WATERFRONT.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.800
Eileen: YOU CAN GET YOUR
PRESENT THERE.

07:15.280 --> 07:17.420
Both: OVER AND OUT.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.460
Both: LET'S GO TO THE

07:18.560 --> 07:19.940

07:20.040 --> 07:21.700
Mordecai: WELL, HERE WE ARE

07:22.920 --> 07:24.580
YUP. ALL SORTS OF SURPRISING

07:24.680 --> 07:26.260
ROMANTIC STUFF HAPPENS HERE.

07:27.400 --> 07:30.000
Both: WHOA!

07:34.080 --> 07:34.620
FOR ME?

07:34.720 --> 07:36.020
SO THAT'S WHY YOU WERE ACTING

07:36.120 --> 07:36.620
ALL...

07:36.720 --> 07:37.980
AND THAT'S WHY YOU MADE ALL

07:38.080 --> 07:38.620
THOSE ââ

07:38.720 --> 07:39.780
Mordecai: EXCUSES.

Mordecai: GOING TO THE

07:43.080 --> 07:43.700
BATHROOM!

07:43.800 --> 07:44.780
I WAS CALLING RIGBY!

07:44.880 --> 07:46.220
I WAS CALLING EILEEN!

07:46.320 --> 07:47.540
( BOTH LAUGH )

07:47.640 --> 07:48.740
Mordecai: I'M SORRY THIS

07:48.840 --> 07:51.840
WASN'T MORE ROMANTIC.
THIS IS THE MOST ROMANTIC

07:51.240 --> 07:55.360
DATE I'VE EVER BEEN ON.
Mordecai: REALLY?

07:55.440 --> 07:56.820
( CRASH )

07:56.920 --> 08:01.900
SOMETHING HIT THE PIER!

08:02.000 --> 08:03.020
LAST CHANCE, MORDECAI!

08:03.120 --> 08:03.940
BREAK UP WITH HER!

08:04.040 --> 08:05.420

08:14.480 --> 08:17.600
HAPPY COUPLES DON'T USE
COUPLE CORRAL!

08:16.400 --> 08:17.220
LONELY PEOPLE DO.

08:17.320 --> 08:20.360
LONELY PEOPLE LEAD TO
SUBSCRIBERS.

08:19.080 --> 08:22.480
SUBSCRIBERS LEAD TO MORE CLICKS.
MORE CLICKS SOMEHOW LEAD TO

08:21.920 --> 08:24.960
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS LEAD TO

08:24.160 --> 08:25.580
SWEET CORPORATEâBRANDED STUFF!

08:25.680 --> 08:26.100
SEE!

08:26.200 --> 08:27.380

08:27.480 --> 08:28.900
MY SITE'S TOO GOOD.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.700
THERE'S NOBODY LEFT.

08:30.800 --> 08:33.260
HAPPY COUPLES HAVE BEEN LEAVING

08:33.360 --> 08:34.300
IN DROVES!

08:34.400 --> 08:35.460
I'M BANKRUPT.

08:35.560 --> 08:38.020
DUDE, JUST SELL YOUR STUFF!

08:38.120 --> 08:40.440
NO!
MY CROOKED LAWYER TOLD ME THIS

08:40.040 --> 08:40.820
IS THE ONLY WAY!

08:40.920 --> 08:41.780
BREAK UP WITH HER!

08:41.880 --> 08:42.780
Mordecai: NO WAY!

08:42.880 --> 08:44.140
WE'RE REALLY INTO EACH OTHER.

08:44.240 --> 08:45.660
IF YOU WON'T BREAK UP WITH

08:45.760 --> 08:46.820
HER, I'LL DO IT FOR YOU.

08:46.920 --> 08:50.600
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO THE
COUPLE CORRAL "BREAKUPULATOR!"

08:50.680 --> 08:52.680

09:01.280 --> 09:02.100
MORDECAI!

09:02.200 --> 09:03.180
WELL, DARN.

09:03.280 --> 09:04.940
THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT LIKE I

09:05.040 --> 09:05.900
WANTED IT TO.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.260
C.J.? REJOIN MY SITE?

09:07.360 --> 09:09.060
( PANTING )

09:09.160 --> 09:09.820
UHâOH.

09:09.920 --> 09:15.060
NOOOOOO!

09:15.160 --> 09:19.000
LEAVE...US...ALONE!

09:26.480 --> 09:29.060
HUBRIS!

09:29.160 --> 09:31.220
( CRYING )

09:31.320 --> 09:37.460
MORDECAI, MORDECAI, MORDECAI...

09:37.560 --> 09:44.460
NO!

09:44.560 --> 09:46.060

09:49.280 --> 09:50.500
MORDECAI!

09:50.600 --> 09:52.300
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.700
Mordecai: I WOULD BE...IF NOT

09:54.800 --> 09:56.060
FOR THIS GIFT BOX.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.860
I HOPE YOU LIKE IT.

09:57.960 --> 09:58.620
( GASPS )

09:58.720 --> 10:00.020
Mordecai: THERE'S A DIFFERENT

10:00.120 --> 10:00.940
CHARM FOR ââ WHOA!

10:01.040 --> 10:02.500
WELL, THERE USED TO BE DIFFERENT

10:02.600 --> 10:05.000
CHARMS.
I GUESS THEY MUST HAVE ALL

10:04.400 --> 10:08.520
GOTTEN WELDED INTO A HEART BY
THE BAZOOKA BLAST.

10:08.600 --> 10:09.220
I LOVE IT.

10:09.320 --> 10:12.640
Mordecai: I THOUGHT THAT YOU
WOULD.

10:11.160 --> 10:12.340
I GUESS THE THING I HAD FOR

10:12.440 --> 10:15.440
YOU MUST'VE EXPLODED.
Mordecai: THAT'S OKAY.

10:14.560 --> 10:15.260
I GOT MY WISH.

10:15.360 --> 10:16.780
WHAT, THAT YOU CAN RUN FASTER

10:16.880 --> 10:19.280

Mordecai: NO.

10:18.120 --> 10:21.280
FOR A CUTE GIRLFRIEND THAT
LIKES ââ

10:19.880 --> 10:21.180

10:30.840 --> 10:32.340
