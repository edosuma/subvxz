WEBVTT

00:02.363 --> 00:04.519
What a day for
American politics.

00:04.649 --> 00:07.077
Former First Lady,
governor of Illinois and

00:07.177 --> 00:09.205
candidate for President
of the United States,

00:09.328 --> 00:11.984
Elaine Barrish Hammond,
just minutes from addressing

00:12.089 --> 00:15.173
the pack ballroom
at the Cliff Hotel in Chicago,

00:15.702 --> 00:16.897
there's not much you can say

00:17.001 --> 00:19.435
about the governor
that hasn't been said.

00:19.503 --> 00:22.171
She's been called everything
from a feminist liberal icon

00:22.239 --> 00:24.807
to an opportunistic
closet conservative--

00:24.875 --> 00:26.428
Cold and ambitious,

00:28.011 --> 00:29.573
to warm, charming,
and unfairly maligned.

00:30.481 --> 00:31.953
But no matter your opinion,

00:32.049 --> 00:34.446
you have to admire
what she has accomplished.

00:34.625 --> 00:35.990
Democrat or Republican,

00:36.223 --> 00:37.254
man or woman,

00:37.404 --> 00:38.442
watching this room,

00:38.943 --> 00:41.581
it is impossible not to feel
a sense of history today.

00:45.395 --> 00:48.030
That's the sound of
the Hammond family

00:48.098 --> 00:50.166
now entering the ballroom.

00:53.303 --> 00:54.737
First is Douglas Hammond

00:54.805 --> 00:58.374
with his girlfriend Anne.

00:58.442 --> 01:01.577
Douglas taking a leadership role
in his mother's campaign.

01:01.645 --> 01:03.079
Some say he has quite a future

01:03.146 --> 01:04.980
of his own in politics.

01:05.048 --> 01:06.382
And of course,

01:06.450 --> 01:09.585
directly behind them is Thomas,

01:09.653 --> 01:12.121
referred to as T.J.

01:12.189 --> 01:14.323
in Hammond circles.

01:14.391 --> 01:16.292
Everyone kept waiting
for his homosexuality

01:16.360 --> 01:17.727
to be an issue,

01:17.794 --> 01:20.730
but, nope, it never was.

01:20.797 --> 01:22.965
The governor's mother

01:23.033 --> 01:24.500
is now entering the room.

01:24.568 --> 01:25.968
Always a fixture

01:26.036 --> 01:29.171
in a Hammond campaign,
dating back to both

01:29.239 --> 01:32.308
of Bud Hammond's successful runs

01:32.376 --> 01:35.111
for the presidency.

01:37.547 --> 01:40.116
If you can't hear anything,

01:40.183 --> 01:43.886
that's because Bud Hammond
just entered the room.

01:43.954 --> 01:47.456
Man, they love this guy.

01:48.659 --> 01:50.293
Former President Hammond

01:50.360 --> 01:51.894
got himself
into a bit of trouble

01:51.962 --> 01:54.163
in the last six months

01:54.231 --> 01:56.499
calling directly into question

01:56.566 --> 01:59.802
Garcetti's competency
for the job.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.074

02:11.148 --> 02:14.583
Governor's theme song
signaling her entrance.

02:16.520 --> 02:18.621
This kind of enthusiasm

02:18.689 --> 02:20.823
is usually reserved
for her husband,

02:20.891 --> 02:24.093
but it's not his name
they're shouting now.

02:59.930 --> 03:02.231
Thank you.
Thank you.

03:04.101 --> 03:06.769
Thank you very much.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.273
Thank you.

03:12.209 --> 03:14.977
Okay, please.

03:15.045 --> 03:17.313
Earlier today,

03:17.381 --> 03:20.683
I called Senator Garcetti
to congratulate him

03:20.751 --> 03:23.753
on a tough
and hard-fought primary...

03:24.921 --> 03:26.589
...but a primary worthy

03:26.656 --> 03:29.558
of the people of this party
and of this great nation.

03:31.595 --> 03:35.164
Although we were not successful
in securing the nomination,

03:35.232 --> 03:39.335
this campaign has
had so many victories,

03:39.403 --> 03:41.237
and I want to take a moment

03:41.304 --> 03:42.772
to say something
to the young women

03:42.839 --> 03:46.108
and little girls
who joined our cause.

03:46.176 --> 03:50.346
Please, don't be discouraged
by my loss.

03:50.414 --> 03:54.450
As sure as I stand here,

03:54.518 --> 03:56.919
and because I stand here,

03:56.987 --> 03:59.088
one day, one of you

03:59.156 --> 04:02.725
will be the President
of the United States of America,

04:02.793 --> 04:04.026
and that is a day

04:04.094 --> 04:07.296
this woman plans
on living to see.

04:21.043 --> 04:23.045
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...!

04:40.597 --> 04:42.364
Mr. President, can
you sign my pin?

04:43.700 --> 04:45.768
Oh, you betcha.

04:45.836 --> 04:48.537
Keep walking, Bud.

04:48.605 --> 04:51.674
Oh... excuse me.

04:51.741 --> 04:53.509
Why can't you run
again, Mr. President?

04:53.577 --> 04:55.344
Would if I could, honey.

04:55.412 --> 04:57.313
I would if I could.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.882
There have been
some serious screwups

04:59.950 --> 05:01.951
that have happened
in this party's history,

05:02.018 --> 05:05.654
but none, none as historic
as this horseshit.

05:05.722 --> 05:06.889
I need a drink.

05:06.957 --> 05:08.224
Just give me two fingers

05:08.291 --> 05:09.825
with a little Diet Coke.

05:09.893 --> 05:11.160
I have to watch my figure.

05:11.228 --> 05:12.728
Come on, you're a
hottie, Grandma.

05:12.796 --> 05:14.697
Oh, all you homos love me.

05:14.764 --> 05:17.967
It's the rich, straight guys
I'm worried about.

05:18.034 --> 05:19.835
What retard with half a brain

05:19.903 --> 05:22.571
thinks that Italian shit show
is gonna win the general?

05:22.639 --> 05:24.039
Florida, gone.

05:24.107 --> 05:25.841
Texas, sayonara.

05:25.909 --> 05:27.810
Arnie wants to make
sure you're still good

05:27.878 --> 05:29.245
sitting down with the
majors in an hour.

05:29.312 --> 05:31.347
If this party thinks
we're lifting one finger

05:31.414 --> 05:34.316
to help that douche get elected,

05:34.384 --> 05:35.718
they've got
another thing coming.

05:35.785 --> 05:37.820
Enough, Bud.
Don't feel bad, babe.

05:37.888 --> 05:40.523
Garcetti had the press corps
eating right off his nut sack.

05:40.590 --> 05:43.192
Even in my prime, he'd
have been a challenge.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.760
I would've licked him
for sure, but...

05:44.828 --> 05:46.662
I said be quiet.

05:46.730 --> 05:49.231
Can we have the room, please?

05:50.767 --> 05:52.768
Now?

05:56.306 --> 05:58.007
It's okay, Sam;
If I wanted to

05:58.074 --> 06:00.576
assassinate him,
I would have done it years ago.

06:00.644 --> 06:02.578
In his sleep.

06:02.646 --> 06:04.880
I should have campaigned more.

06:04.948 --> 06:07.216
They had me spending
so much time

06:07.284 --> 06:08.684
in North Carolina,
you'd have thought

06:08.752 --> 06:09.919
I was running for governor.

06:09.986 --> 06:11.253
You know, I know,

06:11.321 --> 06:13.188
given your epic levels
of narcissism,

06:13.256 --> 06:15.558
that it's impossible
for you to fathom

06:15.625 --> 06:17.526
this loss has nothing
to do with you,

06:17.594 --> 06:19.194
but imagine for a moment
that it doesn't.

06:19.262 --> 06:21.397
The country loves you, Bud.

06:21.464 --> 06:22.898
They will always love you.

06:22.966 --> 06:24.433
It's me they have
mixed feelings about.

06:24.501 --> 06:25.901
Now, now, sugar...

06:25.969 --> 06:27.703
Please don't give me that crap

06:27.771 --> 06:30.272
about how the people would
love me if they just knew me.

06:30.340 --> 06:31.874
It's been 20 years, okay?

06:31.942 --> 06:33.409
They know me.

06:33.476 --> 06:34.610
I hate campaigning.

06:34.678 --> 06:36.745
It's an Olympic sport

06:36.813 --> 06:38.414
in hypocrisy.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.549
Fat smokers droning on and on

06:40.617 --> 06:42.251
about their shitty
medical coverage,

06:42.319 --> 06:44.119
smiling when babies

06:44.187 --> 06:46.322
with runny noses
are shoved in my face,

06:46.389 --> 06:49.291
and most of all, I hate lying.

06:49.359 --> 06:51.260
I hate lying
and telling people that things

06:51.328 --> 06:53.462
are gonna get better
when they never will.

06:53.530 --> 06:55.331
You believe the lie,

06:55.398 --> 06:57.066
and that is why you have won

06:57.133 --> 06:59.602
every election
you've ever been in,

06:59.669 --> 07:01.737
and that's why
Garcetti is going to win, too.

07:01.805 --> 07:02.905
Bullshit.
That man

07:02.973 --> 07:04.840
is going
to be elected president,

07:04.908 --> 07:07.977
and if you don't get in line,
you are going to be be iced out.

07:08.044 --> 07:10.613
I left office with an
84% approval rating.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.915
I am the most popular Democrat

07:12.983 --> 07:14.750
since Kennedy had
his brains splattered

07:14.818 --> 07:16.518
across the Dallas concrete.

07:16.586 --> 07:19.755
Baby, I am the meat in the Big
Mac of this party, right?

07:19.823 --> 07:23.425
The white, creamy center
of its Oreo-freakin'-cookie,

07:23.493 --> 07:26.762
and that greasy, Michael
Corleone knockoff needs me

07:26.830 --> 07:28.931
to win this son of a bitch.

07:28.999 --> 07:30.265
Plain and simple.

07:30.333 --> 07:31.767
You bastard.

07:31.835 --> 07:34.470
It's the hardest moment
of my professional life,

07:34.537 --> 07:38.307
and you can't even pretend
to make this easier for me?

07:38.375 --> 07:40.709
You're asking me to eat shit.

07:40.777 --> 07:44.013
Now, I held the highest
office in the land,

07:44.080 --> 07:47.383
an office only 41 men
before me ever held.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.185
I don't eat shit,

07:50.253 --> 07:51.687
I serve it.

07:59.262 --> 08:01.497
I'm going back
to Springfield tonight.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.799
You can use the room
at the Four Seasons.

08:03.867 --> 08:06.735
We'll still have
the campaign jet but...

08:06.803 --> 08:08.837
it's better if you hitch
a ride with Carslen

08:08.905 --> 08:10.506
or one of the other donors.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.241
My office will work it out
with yours.

08:14.110 --> 08:17.212
And no need to worry
about the state chairs.

08:17.280 --> 08:19.281
I will take care
of that this week.

08:20.984 --> 08:23.318
Oh, and Bud...

08:24.921 --> 08:27.156

32 years of marriage,

09:16.806 --> 09:18.774
you were compelled
to ask for a divorce

09:18.842 --> 09:20.642
the night you conceded
the nomination?

09:20.710 --> 09:22.911
It's not news that
journalists have accused me

09:22.979 --> 09:25.280
of divorcing my husband
for political gain,

09:25.348 --> 09:27.483
it's just...
they don't usually work

09:27.550 --> 09:29.651
for the nation's
leading paper, Ms. Berg.

09:29.719 --> 09:31.286
When he was president,
you stayed.

09:31.354 --> 09:33.422
You left when you lost
your shot at the presidency.

09:33.490 --> 09:34.590
It's a fair assumption that

09:34.657 --> 09:35.958
politics had something
to do with it.

09:36.025 --> 09:37.593
You won a Pulitzer in your 20s

09:37.660 --> 09:39.261
for covering his affairs,
did you not?

09:39.329 --> 09:40.429
I did.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.297
I'm curious, what is it like

09:42.365 --> 09:44.633
launching your career by
stepping on the throat

09:44.701 --> 09:46.068
of someone else's marriage?

09:46.136 --> 09:49.438
His adultery was a story;
I covered it.

09:49.506 --> 09:51.607
No Pulitzers to speak
of since, though?

09:51.674 --> 09:52.975
No.

09:54.844 --> 09:56.845
You went to work
for the Garcetti campaign

09:56.913 --> 09:58.247
immediately after your loss,

09:58.314 --> 09:59.648
developing quite a rapport with

09:59.716 --> 10:01.884
the president,
then still Candidate Garcetti.

10:01.951 --> 10:04.119
Hello, Atlanta!

10:06.189 --> 10:07.923
Looking good!

10:07.991 --> 10:09.892
How would you like to meet

10:09.959 --> 10:12.394
the next President
of the United States?

10:21.337 --> 10:23.806
You know, I'm sure
if you ask nicely,

10:23.873 --> 10:25.741
we can get the senator here

10:25.809 --> 10:29.311
to show off some of the dance
moves he's been sporting lately.

10:29.379 --> 10:30.913

the veep position
and asked for State?

10:49.866 --> 10:51.266
I'm on record as saying

10:51.334 --> 10:53.402
I did not want to be
Secretary of State.

10:53.469 --> 10:55.103
But you said yes.

10:55.171 --> 10:57.005
I'm old-fashioned that way.

for this exquisite
Chuvashian scarf. <i>Spasibo.</i>

11:15.191 --> 11:17.993
Our goal this week
is to prepare for the Tripartite

11:18.061 --> 11:20.262
Energy Summit
with the Chinese government.

11:21.531 --> 11:22.931
There is much

11:22.999 --> 11:27.202
our three countries
have in common...

11:27.270 --> 11:29.204

Madame Secretary,
you have to agree

12:08.244 --> 12:11.313
the former President has
struggled since your divorce.

12:11.381 --> 12:12.948
Recently he's been

12:13.016 --> 12:15.150
romantically linked to
TV star Eva Flores.

12:15.218 --> 12:17.986
A union that hasn't helped
his descent into

12:18.054 --> 12:19.288
political ignominy.

12:27.864 --> 12:30.832
I just wouldn't want to
jeopardize your quote.

12:30.900 --> 12:32.801
It's the best one
a former President's

12:32.869 --> 12:34.736
ever gotten for a, a memoir.

12:34.804 --> 12:36.505
Yeah, well, maybe
I'll write it anyway.

12:36.572 --> 12:38.473
You know, there's
a story to be told here

12:38.541 --> 12:40.208
that the mainstream
media's ignoring.

12:40.276 --> 12:41.977
President Goombah Shitface

12:42.045 --> 12:44.346
says he wants to be a
different president than me,

12:44.414 --> 12:46.515
then he goes and hires
half my administration,

12:46.582 --> 12:49.918
including my ex-wife,
who who should be renamed

12:49.986 --> 12:53.221
Secretary of Save
His Greasy Dago Ass.

12:53.289 --> 12:55.157
Can I get another
Johnny Walker, please?

12:55.224 --> 12:57.993
Now, who is that

12:58.061 --> 13:01.697
gorgeous piece of tail
at the bar?

13:01.764 --> 13:03.432
Keeps looking over here.
Looks familiar.

13:03.499 --> 13:05.200
Eva Flores.

13:05.268 --> 13:07.402
She's on that show where
the doctors bang each other.

13:07.470 --> 13:08.770
Uh, <i>Hawaii Medical.</i>

13:08.838 --> 13:10.772
Excellent program.

13:10.840 --> 13:15.010
Now that is one gifted woman.

13:15.078 --> 13:16.912
I hear those breasts are
insured by the network.

13:16.980 --> 13:18.380
Get out of here.

13:18.448 --> 13:20.015
How does that work?

13:20.083 --> 13:22.351
Something happens to her,
she gets hit by a car,

13:22.418 --> 13:24.553
or a piano falls on her
boobs or something,

13:24.620 --> 13:25.754
they're covered.

13:25.822 --> 13:28.190
Why don't you see

13:28.257 --> 13:29.925
if she'll come over?

13:39.369 --> 13:40.435
Hawaii, how are you?

13:43.473 --> 13:46.942
Oh, you're so funny,
Mr. President.

13:47.010 --> 13:50.412
Call me Bud, darling.

13:50.480 --> 13:53.815
Well, that's gonna be
strange, but I'll try.

13:53.883 --> 13:56.084
You're pretty sexy, Bud.

13:56.152 --> 13:59.154
See? Not so hard.

14:01.624 --> 14:03.425
I'd say it is.

14:03.493 --> 14:05.293
So the rumors are true.

14:07.897 --> 14:10.432
Tom...

14:10.500 --> 14:12.634
bring the car around.

14:12.702 --> 14:14.603
Oh! Oh, yeah!

14:14.670 --> 14:16.471
Oh, yes, Mr. President.

14:16.539 --> 14:18.473
Yes, Mr. President!

14:18.541 --> 14:21.610
I haven't watched her show,
but I hear she's very talented.

14:21.677 --> 14:23.178
Have you seen him
since the divorce?

14:23.246 --> 14:25.013
Bud? No.

14:25.081 --> 14:27.416
So tonight's
the first time, huh?

14:27.483 --> 14:28.984
Any residual feelings there?

14:29.052 --> 14:32.354
If there were
I wouldn't tell you.

14:33.623 --> 14:36.525
What are you
really after, Ms. Berg?

14:36.592 --> 14:38.627
To follow the Secretary
of State for the week

14:38.694 --> 14:40.195
of her son's
engagement party...

14:40.263 --> 14:41.930
Spare me the bullshit.

14:41.998 --> 14:43.832
We're off the record.

14:43.900 --> 14:46.535
My office informed me that
we were given a choice,

14:46.602 --> 14:48.303
either I let you
cover me the week

14:48.371 --> 14:49.871
of Douglas's engagement,

14:49.939 --> 14:51.773
or you were gonna run a piece

14:51.841 --> 14:55.110
about my other son Thomas's
difficulties with sobriety.

14:55.178 --> 14:56.945
An empty threat.

14:57.013 --> 14:59.147
Except that you managed
to obtain a sealed document

14:59.215 --> 15:01.950
regarding one night
last December.

15:02.018 --> 15:03.385
I did.

15:03.453 --> 15:04.853
You're a newspaper.

15:04.921 --> 15:06.321
That's news, and yet

15:06.389 --> 15:08.824
you traded it
for a week with me.

15:08.891 --> 15:11.193
Which brings me to my
original question.

15:11.260 --> 15:13.728
What are you really after?

15:13.796 --> 15:15.330
Like any good reporter,
Madame Secretary,

15:15.398 --> 15:16.865
I want the truth.

15:16.933 --> 15:19.301
Why did you ask your
ex-husband for a divorce

15:19.368 --> 15:20.502
that night?

15:20.570 --> 15:22.137
Was he too much
political baggage

15:22.205 --> 15:23.839
for you to recreate
yourself in the face

15:23.906 --> 15:25.574
of such a setback,

15:25.641 --> 15:27.843
or did you just think
your political career was over,

15:27.910 --> 15:31.546
so you no longer had to tolerate
his rampant infidelity?

15:31.614 --> 15:35.317
Were you surprised at the
public's reaction to the split?

15:35.384 --> 15:36.918
That the President
was suddenly despised

15:36.986 --> 15:39.054
for the same
repugnant sexual behavior

15:39.122 --> 15:42.057
that the country used to find
roguish and cute?

15:42.125 --> 15:44.693
That you were suddenly beloved

15:44.760 --> 15:47.362
after having been viewed
for so long as a...

15:47.430 --> 15:49.498
cold and calculating
political animal?

15:49.565 --> 15:53.401
And lastly, do you regret
staying with him for so long?

15:53.469 --> 15:54.603
Was it worth it

15:54.670 --> 15:56.271
if you didn't get
the grand prize,

15:56.339 --> 15:58.340
the gold...

15:58.407 --> 16:01.309
glittering tiara
of the Presidency?

16:05.181 --> 16:06.615
How'd it go?

16:06.682 --> 16:08.717
Can you remember what
my mother called her?

16:08.784 --> 16:10.185
A bitch with a capital "C."

16:10.253 --> 16:11.419
She undersold it.

16:11.487 --> 16:13.021
And I should know,

16:13.089 --> 16:16.424
being a card-carrying member
of the club myself.

16:18.261 --> 16:19.694
Madame Secretary,

16:19.762 --> 16:21.129
Bolivian Embassy's
office on the line.

16:21.197 --> 16:23.098
They've been holding
for 20 minutes.

16:23.166 --> 16:26.134
Also Undersecretary Bradford
and Secretary Rivera's office

16:26.202 --> 16:29.037
are also on hold,
they say it's important.

16:29.105 --> 16:30.872
Tell Rivera's office to hold,
the rest I'll call back.

16:30.940 --> 16:32.274
Put that away.

16:32.341 --> 16:33.742
Put it away. Are you
certain there's no way

16:33.809 --> 16:36.411
I can get out
of the remainder of this?

16:36.479 --> 16:38.113
Not unless you're cool with
the world finding out

16:38.181 --> 16:40.582
what happened with T.J.,
or with what he might do

16:40.650 --> 16:42.617
once the world finds out.
And when the <i>Times</i> or the <i>Post</i>

16:42.685 --> 16:44.419
get a hold of the story,
do we just give them

16:44.487 --> 16:45.420
whatever they want, too?

16:45.488 --> 16:47.255
Susan Berg despises you.

16:47.323 --> 16:48.924
She's wanted a sit-down

16:48.991 --> 16:51.159
since you sequestered her
from Bud's White House.

16:51.227 --> 16:53.595
Well, she finally figured
out how to get one.

16:53.663 --> 16:56.798
No one else of merit
is going to chase this.

16:56.866 --> 16:58.400
They're not.
See you later?

16:58.467 --> 16:59.568
Yeah.

16:59.635 --> 17:01.269
Thomas is coming tonight, right?

17:01.337 --> 17:03.605
Yeah, yeah, he wants
to talk with you and dad

17:03.673 --> 17:05.140
about the, uh, nightclub.

17:05.208 --> 17:07.108
The nightclub?
Oh, Christ.

17:07.175 --> 17:08.843
I already told him
you won't do it.

17:08.911 --> 17:09.911
I won't.
Hey, are you even

17:09.979 --> 17:12.146
sure you want dad there tonight?

17:12.214 --> 17:13.915
You know, if I'm finally
gonna be in the same room

17:13.983 --> 17:14.950
with Anne's parents,

17:15.017 --> 17:16.251
and your father,

17:16.319 --> 17:17.618
and his actress girlfriend,

17:17.686 --> 17:19.521
I would rather
not do that on the night

17:19.589 --> 17:20.789
of the engagement party.

17:20.856 --> 17:22.490
The Secretary dropped off.

17:22.558 --> 17:24.025
He's gonna meet you
at the White House now.

17:24.093 --> 17:25.327
You're being called in.

17:25.394 --> 17:28.597
What did they
screw up this time?

17:28.664 --> 17:30.498
I forgot what a
flaming-bitch-on-wheels

17:30.566 --> 17:31.800
that woman is.

17:31.867 --> 17:33.635
Whatever feud exists,
she started.

17:33.703 --> 17:35.237
I mean, one little comment
about her epitomizing

17:35.304 --> 17:37.305
the death of feminism
and they banned me

17:37.373 --> 17:38.940
from the White House
for six years.

17:39.008 --> 17:41.176
I couldn't even go to
the Easter Egg roll.

17:41.244 --> 17:42.911
I love the Easter Egg roll.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.813
Uh, hey,

17:44.880 --> 17:46.781
just remember that you have
the Secretary's salon tonight.

17:46.849 --> 17:48.683
So you might want to
go home and, uh,

17:48.751 --> 17:50.252
change before that.

17:50.319 --> 17:51.987
What's wrong
with what I'm wearing?

17:52.054 --> 17:53.989
I wear one outfit a day.
I'm not Beyonce.

17:54.056 --> 17:55.590
Yeah, no, it's fine.
It's just, uh,

17:55.658 --> 17:58.326
it's not incredibly
salon-y, I guess.

17:58.394 --> 18:00.695
Russ, exactly how many political
salons have you been to?

18:00.763 --> 18:02.864
Zero.
Yeah, none. Yeah.

18:02.932 --> 18:04.366
There you go. Good-bye.

18:13.876 --> 18:15.110
My own candle.
You blow it out...

18:15.177 --> 18:16.544
Blow out the candle.
Blow it out.

18:16.612 --> 18:19.281
Blow it out.
Somebody blow something quick.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.149
Hey, we're celebrating.

18:21.217 --> 18:22.350
My blog hit over

18:22.418 --> 18:23.785
one million unique
users this month.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.154
So I made cupcakes.

18:26.222 --> 18:28.056
That's great, Georgia.

18:28.124 --> 18:29.724
You know, if you
ever wanted to contribute,

18:29.792 --> 18:31.626
it would be a complete honor.

18:31.694 --> 18:33.728
I'd love to. I could share
my favorite dating tips,

18:33.796 --> 18:35.430
or, uh, revealing
beauty secrets.

18:37.500 --> 18:40.769
Uh, well, I should
get back to work.

18:40.836 --> 18:42.304
I'm filing my story on what

18:42.371 --> 18:43.438
Eva Flores might be wearing

18:43.506 --> 18:44.873
to the Hammond engagement party.

18:44.940 --> 18:48.777
Better hurry before Woodward
files it first.

18:48.844 --> 18:51.646
You're going to the Secretary's
salon tonight, right?

18:51.714 --> 18:52.881
Yes, I am.

18:52.948 --> 18:55.350
I'm sure it's pretty casual.

18:57.420 --> 19:00.488
She is the journalistic
equivalent of a weather girl.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.090
Claws in.

19:02.158 --> 19:03.325
She looks up to you.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.260
Well, I don't trust her.

19:05.328 --> 19:07.062
If Eve Harrington were
an actual person today,

19:07.129 --> 19:08.697
she would look like Georgia.

19:08.764 --> 19:11.833
She would bake cupcakes,
and she would have a blog.

19:11.901 --> 19:15.070
And her little crush on you
is growing irritating.

19:15.137 --> 19:17.672
Don't worry, I got a crush
on somebody else.

19:19.842 --> 19:21.076
We're at work.

19:21.143 --> 19:23.545
Babe, we live together.
Everybody knows.

19:23.612 --> 19:25.213
Yeah, well, you're
a guy and my boss.

19:25.281 --> 19:27.349
If we kiss at the office,
you get high fives.

19:27.416 --> 19:28.917
I get glares
from people who think,

19:28.984 --> 19:30.952
"That whore is
sleeping with our editor."

19:33.122 --> 19:35.056
I'm sorry.

19:35.124 --> 19:37.459
It's this Barrish interview.
It's got me in a mood.

19:37.526 --> 19:40.362
She brought up the Pulitzer.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.797
If the world only knew how
insecure you actually are.

19:45.768 --> 19:48.136
Alex Davies.

19:48.204 --> 19:50.271
Gary, slow down.

19:50.339 --> 19:52.774
All right, just hang on a
second, let me, I got a pen.

19:52.842 --> 19:54.309
All right, talk to me.

19:54.377 --> 19:55.877
Something happened in Iran.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.422
<i>At approximately</i>
<i>0930 this morning,</i>

20:07.490 --> 20:09.157
<i>Iran Standard Time,</i>

20:09.225 --> 20:11.326
<i>the Iranian Ministry of</i>
<i>Intelligence apprehended</i>

20:11.394 --> 20:13.428
<i>three American journalists</i>
<i>in Tehran.</i>

20:13.496 --> 20:16.164
The Iranian military
moved them to a facility

20:16.232 --> 20:17.499
where they were interrogated,

20:17.566 --> 20:18.767
until they each
signed a confession

20:18.834 --> 20:20.101
admitting to spying

20:20.169 --> 20:21.836
on behalf of the
American government.

20:21.904 --> 20:23.438
Now President Hakam's
administration

20:23.506 --> 20:25.140
has just released the names
of the journalists,

20:25.207 --> 20:28.410
all three of whom are of
Iranian-American descent,

20:28.477 --> 20:30.845
and made a statement
promising a swift trial

20:30.913 --> 20:34.182
within the next 48 hours.

20:34.250 --> 20:37.419
Well, someone has to ask it...

20:37.486 --> 20:39.354
are they actually spies?

20:39.422 --> 20:41.189
No. They're innocent,

20:41.257 --> 20:43.491
but with the signed admission
and a sham trial,

20:43.559 --> 20:44.993
they'll be convicted.

20:45.060 --> 20:47.328
Hakam is promising
the death penalty unless

20:47.396 --> 20:49.831
President Garcetti negotiates
for their release himself,

20:49.899 --> 20:51.466
and in person.

20:51.534 --> 20:52.801
You're kidding.

20:52.868 --> 20:54.803
He wants the President
of the United States

20:54.870 --> 20:57.472
to fly to Iran and beg
for their release?

20:59.241 --> 21:00.708
What is he smoking?

21:06.248 --> 21:07.882
How long have you all
known about this?

21:07.950 --> 21:10.385
Well, I, for one,
am just finding out.

21:10.453 --> 21:12.187
I'm sorry, Mr. Vice President.

21:12.254 --> 21:14.789
We've only known
for a few hours ourselves.

21:14.857 --> 21:16.724
We were trying to handle
this internally.

21:16.792 --> 21:18.827
You were trying to handle
a diplomatic crisis

21:18.894 --> 21:22.730
with a hostile regime in a
combustible region internally?

21:22.798 --> 21:24.799
Well, we figured that you had
your son's big engagement party

21:24.867 --> 21:26.367
this week-- we didn't
want to bother you...

21:26.435 --> 21:28.803
That is so thoughtful of you,
but seeing as how I am

21:28.871 --> 21:30.672
the nation's leading diplomat,

21:30.739 --> 21:33.541
I should probably be involved
when there's a hostage crisis.

21:33.609 --> 21:34.976
This is not a hostage crisis.

21:35.044 --> 21:37.479
They are wrongfully
detained prisoners.

21:37.546 --> 21:39.848
They're innocent civilians
being held against their will.

21:39.915 --> 21:41.749
The American people
aren't idiots.

21:41.817 --> 21:43.985
I don't think
that they're idiots.

21:44.053 --> 21:46.421
You ran my campaign, Barry,
I know what you think of them.

21:46.489 --> 21:48.056
Elaine, you're right.

21:48.123 --> 21:49.858
You should have been notified.

21:49.925 --> 21:51.893
Both you and Fred.

21:51.961 --> 21:54.062
I understand, Mr. President.

21:54.129 --> 21:56.197
If there's anything you need...

21:56.265 --> 21:58.933
I stand at the ready.

21:59.001 --> 22:01.503
Not presently, Fred. Thank you.

22:02.938 --> 22:04.539
Why would he do this?

22:04.607 --> 22:06.241
I mean, he knows you're not
going to capitulate.

22:06.308 --> 22:08.109
That's what we're trying
to figure out.

22:08.177 --> 22:11.446
But with the expedited trial,
we don't have much time.

22:11.514 --> 22:12.881
I'd like to try some
other contacts,

22:12.948 --> 22:15.383
and call the journalists'
families.

22:15.451 --> 22:17.352
I'm assuming no one
has done that.

22:18.587 --> 22:20.522
Right. Figures.

22:20.589 --> 22:22.423
Actually, there is
one other thing.

22:22.491 --> 22:24.726
We've prepared a statement for
you to read to the press...

22:24.793 --> 22:27.395
Hey, that's bullshit, all right?
We release our own statements.

22:27.463 --> 22:29.230
You are not your mother.
That is the department's policy.

22:29.298 --> 22:30.698
You cannot talk to me--
Douglas.

22:30.766 --> 22:32.567
Listen, Elaine,

22:32.635 --> 22:34.802
don't say anything you
don't want to say, but we've got

22:34.870 --> 22:36.137
the budget review
coming next week,

22:36.205 --> 22:37.639
I'm in the middle of a standoff

22:37.706 --> 22:39.641
with the House Republicans
on this EPA deal.

22:39.708 --> 22:42.710
If you can keep the press
calm on this one...

22:42.778 --> 22:45.213
I'd appreciate it.

22:47.116 --> 22:48.950
That's all.

22:49.018 --> 22:51.586
<i>I mean, could they</i>
<i>be more incompetent?</i>

22:51.654 --> 22:54.055
If the American people really
knew how this government ran,

22:54.123 --> 22:55.790
there would be one big
collective upchuck

22:55.858 --> 22:58.826
the size of which FEMA
would have to clean up.

22:58.894 --> 23:00.995
We probably shouldn't start
the press conference with that.

23:01.063 --> 23:02.830
Where are we with the contacts?

23:02.898 --> 23:04.465
Linus got off with his
counterpart in Syria.

23:04.533 --> 23:05.466
They don't know anything

23:05.534 --> 23:07.268
Every time there is a fire

23:07.336 --> 23:08.770
the administration tries to use
your popularity...

23:08.837 --> 23:10.305
I want the name
of every foreign ambassador

23:10.372 --> 23:11.973
who's currently in the U.S.
You know what?

23:12.041 --> 23:14.142
Let's just forget it-- let's
forget the press conference.

23:14.209 --> 23:16.144
If we don't draw a line
in the sand with Harris

23:16.211 --> 23:17.645
and the White House now...

23:18.881 --> 23:20.415
You could've gotten
yourself fired

23:20.482 --> 23:22.584
for that kind of behavior
in front of the President.

23:22.651 --> 23:24.485
I'll call you back, Ron.
He's not just a boss.

23:24.553 --> 23:26.921
He's not your floor manager
at Chili's,

23:26.989 --> 23:29.023
he is the President
of the United States.

23:29.091 --> 23:31.759
And whether or not this
administration is trading

23:31.827 --> 23:33.661
on my popularity
is not what matters now.

23:33.729 --> 23:34.963
All that matters now

23:35.030 --> 23:37.632
are the three scared,
innocent people

23:37.700 --> 23:39.767
sitting in a jail cell
in Tehran,

23:39.835 --> 23:42.236
wondering what the hell their
country is doing to help them.

23:43.606 --> 23:45.540
Are we clear?
Yes.

23:45.608 --> 23:49.377
Hakam may be an evil bastard,
but he's not crazy.

23:49.445 --> 23:51.679
He's on good terms
with the Supreme Leader,

23:51.747 --> 23:53.181
elections aren't for two years.

23:53.248 --> 23:54.382
Why pick a fight with us now?

23:54.450 --> 23:56.284
It doesn't make sense.

23:56.352 --> 23:58.019
It's the Middle East,
it's the diplomatic equivalent

23:58.087 --> 24:00.455
of instructions from IKEA.

24:00.522 --> 24:02.557
None of it makes any sense.

24:02.625 --> 24:04.559
Go home, get ready for tonight.

24:04.627 --> 24:05.994
Make sure you still have

24:06.061 --> 24:07.562
a fiancée to have a
party with this weekend.

24:07.630 --> 24:09.464
Go on.

24:13.702 --> 24:15.903
He has your sense of loyalty.

24:15.971 --> 24:17.038
He hates how they treat you

24:17.106 --> 24:18.706
and this department.

24:18.774 --> 24:20.208
He hates losing.

24:20.275 --> 24:23.544
That's not me,
that's his father.

24:23.612 --> 24:25.480
Sophia, what do you have for me?

24:25.547 --> 24:27.582
This is yet another
reprehensible act

24:27.650 --> 24:29.817
by an authoritarian state.
These journalists...

24:29.885 --> 24:32.654
...have been wrongfully detained
and are innocent of all charges.

24:32.721 --> 24:34.589
The president is doing
everything he can

24:34.657 --> 24:37.225
to handle the matter swiftly
and to get the journalists

24:37.292 --> 24:39.494
released safely
to the Swiss embassy,

24:39.561 --> 24:41.696
our de facto embassy in Iran.

24:41.764 --> 24:44.332
The situation in Iran adds
to an already busy week

24:44.400 --> 24:46.000
for the Secretary of State.

24:46.068 --> 24:49.237
Her son Douglas's engagement
is the must-attend event

24:49.304 --> 24:50.738
in DC this weekend.

24:50.806 --> 24:52.407
<i>Former President Bud Hammond</i>

24:52.474 --> 24:54.609
<i>and girlfriend,</i>
<i>actress Eva Flores,</i>

24:54.677 --> 24:56.411
arrived in DC today,

24:56.478 --> 24:58.079
where the star of the hit show
<i>Hawaii Medical...</i>

24:58.147 --> 25:01.015
If I had a rack like hers,
I might still be getting laid.

25:01.083 --> 25:03.851
You know, <i>People</i> magazine says

25:03.919 --> 25:06.020
the show actually
has them insured.

25:06.088 --> 25:08.256
Hello, Mother.
Hi, dearie.

25:08.323 --> 25:10.091
T.J.
Hey, Mama.

25:10.159 --> 25:11.125
You're getting too skinny.

25:12.661 --> 25:14.462
Hey, boys, hey, Jack,
hey, Teddy, hey, Bobby.

25:14.530 --> 25:16.698
You're not going
to see Bud for the first time

25:16.765 --> 25:18.733
in two years
dressed like that, I hope.

25:18.801 --> 25:20.368
Well, first of all,
I'm divorced.

25:20.436 --> 25:23.971
Secondly, I was involved
in a diplomatic crisis all day.

25:24.039 --> 25:25.907
I didn't have time
for a costume change.

25:25.974 --> 25:27.141
Oh.
Are you two

25:27.209 --> 25:28.776
really drinking already?

25:28.844 --> 25:30.478
T.J. started it.

25:30.546 --> 25:33.948
He said that you can't make
margaritas with Jack Daniels.

25:34.016 --> 25:35.083
Turns out you can.

25:35.150 --> 25:36.484
Of course.
And it's good.

25:36.552 --> 25:38.653
Hey, I saw the attendee list.

25:38.721 --> 25:40.488
Why is that bitch
Susan Berg coming?

25:40.556 --> 25:41.489
Because that bitch

25:41.557 --> 25:42.990
is covering me this week.

25:43.058 --> 25:44.959
Please do me the favor
of not talking to her,

25:45.027 --> 25:46.327
or if you must,

25:46.395 --> 25:48.896
try not saying things like
the country didn't elect me

25:48.964 --> 25:50.798
because they didn't want
to sleep with me.

25:50.866 --> 25:51.933
It's true.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.569
Hey, so I met
the investors today.

25:54.636 --> 25:56.471
I'd be one
of the lead partners in DC.

25:56.538 --> 25:59.674
I already told you, I am
not giving you $100,000

25:59.742 --> 26:01.309
to invest in a nightclub.

26:01.376 --> 26:03.177
It's a restaurant
and a nightclub,

26:03.245 --> 26:04.479
and I don't need 100,
I need 50.

26:04.546 --> 26:06.748
I can get
the other 50 from Dad.

26:06.815 --> 26:09.183
What's this?

26:09.251 --> 26:11.686
Well, I rummaged
through your spare closet

26:11.754 --> 26:13.588
and found something I thought
you'd look killer in tonight.

26:13.655 --> 26:15.022
Figured you wouldn't give
yourself the time.

26:15.090 --> 26:17.325
I can't fit into this.

26:17.392 --> 26:19.327
You will.

26:19.394 --> 26:20.795
I didn't get all the gay genes,

26:20.863 --> 26:22.530
but I got the style one.

26:22.598 --> 26:23.731
When did I wear this?

26:25.234 --> 26:29.203
The state dinner for the
Saudi royals when I was 15.

26:29.271 --> 26:32.507
It's right after Dad's first
affair leaked to the press.

26:32.574 --> 26:33.841
You said you bought it because

26:33.909 --> 26:35.343
it's always important
to look your best

26:35.410 --> 26:37.545
when you feel your worst.

26:40.082 --> 26:44.385
Thomas... Susan
Berg has the story.

26:44.453 --> 26:46.387
She knows about last December.

26:46.455 --> 26:48.856
She agreed not to run it if we
let her cover me this week.

26:48.924 --> 26:50.725
So we stopped her, but...

26:50.793 --> 26:53.661
It's okay--
no, it-it's, it's okay.

26:53.729 --> 26:55.296
Occupational hazard, right?

26:55.364 --> 26:57.498
Comes with being a Hammond.

26:57.566 --> 27:00.935
They only love us when
they're not busy hating us.

27:03.772 --> 27:07.708
Listen, about the nightclub...

27:07.776 --> 27:09.811
talk to your father.

27:09.878 --> 27:13.014
If he's in, I'm in.

27:15.050 --> 27:17.285
Seriously?
Yeah.

27:18.921 --> 27:19.854
If.

27:19.922 --> 27:21.322
That is awesome.

27:21.390 --> 27:23.191
Oh, my God, wait till you see
the business plan--

27:23.258 --> 27:24.659
it's 50 pages.

27:24.726 --> 27:27.895
It's got pictures,
blueprints, and...

27:27.963 --> 27:30.398
Hey, do you, you want me
to help you with your hair?

27:30.465 --> 27:31.866
Oh, no, I got it, sweetie.

27:45.550 --> 27:47.050
<i>The guy said, "Well,</i>
<i>actually I prefer the pancake."</i>

27:48.553 --> 27:51.588
Beatrice, you get any
younger, we're going

27:51.656 --> 27:52.756
to have to make you

27:52.824 --> 27:54.458
a flower girl at the wedding.

27:58.129 --> 28:00.063
Beatrice,

28:00.131 --> 28:03.000
Larry, so good to see you.

28:03.067 --> 28:04.435
Exciting week.

28:04.502 --> 28:06.770
Hello, lovebirds.

28:06.838 --> 28:08.138
Mm! You look
so beautiful.

28:08.206 --> 28:09.206
Darling.

28:10.408 --> 28:12.342
Bud.

28:12.410 --> 28:14.745
Sugar.

28:15.814 --> 28:16.980
Oh.

28:17.048 --> 28:18.749
Goodness.

28:18.817 --> 28:20.751
Uh, Elaine, this is Eva.

28:20.819 --> 28:22.286
Elaine Barrish.

28:22.353 --> 28:23.454
I'm a fan of your work.

28:23.521 --> 28:24.521
Thank you, Madam Secretary.

28:24.589 --> 28:27.324
I'm a fan of your work, too,

28:27.392 --> 28:28.859
and I love your dress.

28:28.927 --> 28:30.160
Thank you, it's an old one.

28:30.228 --> 28:33.263
Saudi state dinner,
October '97.

28:33.331 --> 28:35.265
Yes.

28:35.333 --> 28:36.333
Good times.

28:36.401 --> 28:37.434
Shall we?

28:37.502 --> 28:39.503
Yeah.

28:41.739 --> 28:44.007
So glad you could join us,
Ms. Berg.

28:44.075 --> 28:46.477
Thanks for the invite,
Madam Secretary.

28:46.544 --> 28:48.011
You changed.

28:48.079 --> 28:49.847
You did, too.

28:49.914 --> 28:51.915
Please.

29:12.070 --> 29:14.037
I know who you are, honey,
don't waste your time.

29:14.105 --> 29:17.007
They never let me talk
on the record anyway.

29:17.075 --> 29:20.711
I'm either too drunk or too
honest... or God forbid, both.

29:20.778 --> 29:21.845
We're, we're off the record.

29:21.913 --> 29:23.847
Tonight is just for color.

29:23.915 --> 29:26.016
Oh, just for color?

29:26.084 --> 29:28.285
Well, tell me, do you
have a boyfriend?

29:28.353 --> 29:30.287
Um, yes, I do.

29:30.355 --> 29:31.522
Is that right?

29:31.589 --> 29:33.123
I always thought
you were a lesbian.

29:34.859 --> 29:38.028
Hmm, but you sure know how
to throw yourself together,

29:38.096 --> 29:42.499
unlike my daughter, but, then,
she has strength of character,

29:42.567 --> 29:46.503
and you're just a rotten
little thing, makes a living

29:46.571 --> 29:50.874
saying really smart, really
nasty things about people.

29:50.942 --> 29:53.210
But you've got a boyfriend.

29:53.278 --> 29:54.878
How about that?

29:54.946 --> 29:57.781
You must give one hell
of a hummer, lady.

30:07.825 --> 30:10.527
Ms. Berg,

30:10.595 --> 30:12.596
I've read a few of your pieces
on the president.

30:12.664 --> 30:14.264
Now, what was it
you called him--

30:14.332 --> 30:16.033
the Fashion...?

30:16.100 --> 30:18.068
Fashionista-in-Chief.
The Fashionista-in-Chief.

30:18.136 --> 30:19.570
You know, I like that line,

30:19.637 --> 30:22.940
"He was elected
a man of the people,

30:23.007 --> 30:24.875
but he's just a man
of the Prada."

30:26.578 --> 30:28.679
Oh, they always dress
us in Prada on the show, and

30:28.746 --> 30:31.915
I always complain because my
character Nurse Anna Alvares--

30:31.983 --> 30:33.750
she could never afford that
in real life.

30:33.818 --> 30:35.819
It's just so not realistic.

30:38.323 --> 30:39.623
And all the screwing

30:39.691 --> 30:41.725
your characters do--
how realistic is that?

30:43.828 --> 30:45.062
More wine, please.

30:47.198 --> 30:49.466
I'm sorry,
Mr. Ambassador, my Japanese

30:49.534 --> 30:51.702
isn't too great.

30:51.769 --> 30:55.205
I ask, you been
to Japan recently?

30:55.273 --> 30:57.374
Oh, not since the '80s.

30:57.442 --> 31:00.944
My parents were born here,
as was I.

31:01.012 --> 31:02.946
We're thinking
of going to Japan

31:03.014 --> 31:05.248
for our honeymoon,
Mr. Ambassador.

31:05.316 --> 31:06.883
We were?

31:06.951 --> 31:08.719
Well, you know, it's,
it's on the list.

31:08.786 --> 31:11.288
Why did you guys pick the zoo
for your engagement party?

31:11.356 --> 31:13.223
Oh, our family has always
been big supporters

31:13.291 --> 31:15.292
of the National, ever since
we first moved to DC.

31:15.360 --> 31:18.595
I used to take the
boys there all the time.

31:18.663 --> 31:19.763
They loved the elephants,

31:19.831 --> 31:21.732
and this event is
helping to fund

31:21.799 --> 31:22.799
a new enclosure.

31:22.867 --> 31:23.800
I think it was my mom

31:23.868 --> 31:24.801
that loved the elephants.

31:26.204 --> 31:27.804
You know, working with Anne

31:27.872 --> 31:29.473
on the engagement party

31:29.540 --> 31:31.141
has been a delight.

31:31.209 --> 31:33.443
The sheer number of guests
and the size of the venue

31:33.511 --> 31:36.480
could overwhelm anyone,
but she has been a dream.

31:36.547 --> 31:40.951
You know, it's funny, she was
so messy when she was little.

31:41.019 --> 31:42.619
- Mom.
- Oh, family secret.

31:42.687 --> 31:44.254
Haven't seen that Anne.

31:44.322 --> 31:46.657
I've only seen
the perfect Anne, right?

32:37.542 --> 32:39.710
Douglas,

32:39.777 --> 32:41.611
Anne told me you're thinking
of having the wedding

32:41.679 --> 32:43.146
near us in Del Mar?

32:43.214 --> 32:45.649
Uh, yeah, yeah, we, we, we
were talking about that.

32:45.717 --> 32:48.518
Really? Del Mar?

32:48.586 --> 32:50.320
You didn't mention that.

32:50.388 --> 32:52.222
It was just one idea that
we've been tossing around.

32:52.290 --> 32:53.857
But we're pretty partial

32:53.925 --> 32:56.226
to it, seeing how
it's where I grew up.

32:57.929 --> 33:02.165
I just want to say a few
words to the two lovebirds.

33:04.235 --> 33:05.869
Now, ever since

33:05.937 --> 33:07.904
Dougie was a little shit

33:07.972 --> 33:09.072
running around
the North Carolina

33:09.140 --> 33:11.341
governor's mansion,

33:11.409 --> 33:12.909
if I was going to pick

33:12.977 --> 33:14.044
one of my boys

33:14.112 --> 33:15.545
to end up a homosexual,

33:15.613 --> 33:17.047
I'd have picked Dougie.

33:17.115 --> 33:19.716
The boy was gay

33:19.784 --> 33:21.418
as a spring dress.

33:21.486 --> 33:23.186
Clothes had to be perfect,

33:23.254 --> 33:25.055
the hair had to be perfect.

33:25.123 --> 33:26.590
This is awesome.

33:26.657 --> 33:28.158
M-Move it along, Dad.

33:28.226 --> 33:30.727
And typical Dougie,

33:30.795 --> 33:34.698
he went and found himself
the perfect wife-to-be.

33:34.766 --> 33:37.868
Anne, you're a treasure.

33:37.935 --> 33:38.869
Welcome to the family.

33:38.936 --> 33:40.604
Hear, hear.

33:40.671 --> 33:41.772
Cheers.

33:41.839 --> 33:43.640
Couldn't be more proud
of you, son.

33:55.753 --> 33:58.388
Hey, can I, can I talk
to you guys for a second?

33:58.456 --> 34:02.259
Yeah, sure.

34:02.326 --> 34:04.528
Exc-Excuse us.

34:04.595 --> 34:07.297
We're, we're just gonna...

34:07.365 --> 34:09.266
Same guys that did Soho House.

34:09.333 --> 34:11.034
I mean, it's-- look,
if you just take

34:11.101 --> 34:13.436
a look at these numbers on
here, okay, we're talking

34:13.504 --> 34:15.705
3,000 square feet of
prime real estate.

34:15.773 --> 34:17.808
In this market, we're
getting it for a steal.

34:17.875 --> 34:19.275
Here's the view

34:19.342 --> 34:21.745
of the Capitol Dome
from the patio.

34:21.813 --> 34:23.246
That's why we're
calling it The Dome.

34:23.313 --> 34:24.481
Killer name, right?

34:24.549 --> 34:25.815
No.

34:27.952 --> 34:29.886
No?

34:29.954 --> 34:32.489
Dad, what, y-y-you need
to think about it...

34:32.556 --> 34:34.558
I'm not doing it,
neither is your mama.

34:34.625 --> 34:36.126
She already said yes-- tell him.
No.

34:36.194 --> 34:38.762
I said <i>if</i> your father committed.

34:38.830 --> 34:40.764
You're a goddamn liar.
Hey, hey, hey,

34:40.831 --> 34:42.098
now, don't you talk
to your mother like that.

34:42.166 --> 34:43.166
Giving a drug addict

34:43.234 --> 34:44.900
that kind of money
is like buying

34:44.969 --> 34:46.735
a blind man a gorgeous hooker--
it's plain stupid.

34:46.804 --> 34:49.239
I've been going to NA meetings.

34:49.306 --> 34:51.241
And the drinking-- you're
wasted right now, aren't you?

34:51.309 --> 34:53.009
My problem was never alcohol.
No, your problem

34:53.077 --> 34:54.844
was looking for any excuse
in the world to get messed up.

34:54.911 --> 34:56.413
Three boarding schools,

34:56.480 --> 34:57.781
two colleges...
Bud.

34:57.849 --> 34:59.850
Why don't you play
the piano anymore?

34:59.917 --> 35:03.153
People don't become concert
pianists at 30, Dad,

35:03.221 --> 35:04.187
it just doesn't happen.

35:04.255 --> 35:05.622
It's what you love.

35:05.690 --> 35:07.657
Now, I can speak to someone
at Georgetown or GW,

35:07.725 --> 35:09.492
I can get you a job
on the staff.

35:09.560 --> 35:11.795
I'm not going to be some
lame-ass piano teacher.

35:11.863 --> 35:14.097
You guys just want me
to have a boring life.

35:14.165 --> 35:16.233
After that stunt you pulled
last December,

35:16.300 --> 35:18.568
boring might do you some good.

35:23.474 --> 35:25.609
Is that what it was
to you-- a stunt?

35:25.676 --> 35:28.044
No.

35:30.648 --> 35:32.582
I hate this family.

35:32.650 --> 35:34.818
- Oh, T.J.
- All right, all right.

35:34.886 --> 35:37.254
How am I ever supposed
to do anything important

35:37.321 --> 35:39.856
if nobody ever helps me?

35:41.726 --> 35:43.693
Hey...

35:49.166 --> 35:51.101
He worked on that speech
for three months.

35:51.168 --> 35:53.169
You could have at
least heard him out.

35:53.237 --> 35:56.506
Your mother was never gonna
say yes to that bullshit idea.

35:56.574 --> 35:58.575
She brought me here
to be the bad guy.

35:58.643 --> 36:02.312
Same reason
she keeps you around.

36:02.380 --> 36:06.316
You know... I've
enjoyed the last year.

36:06.384 --> 36:08.318
Yeah, without Mom

36:08.386 --> 36:10.587
or the White House
to hide behind,

36:10.655 --> 36:12.789
people finally see you
for what you really are--

36:12.857 --> 36:14.791
a big joke.

36:19.864 --> 36:23.300
Nice to see you haven't
lost your touch with him.

36:24.502 --> 36:26.670
You got a blind
spot for T.J.

36:26.737 --> 36:28.238
Always did.

36:28.306 --> 36:30.307
<i>He didn't choose our life,</i>

36:30.374 --> 36:33.109
<i>and he doesn't have</i>
<i>the strength to withstand it.</i>

36:34.845 --> 36:37.180
He's a ticking bomb,
just like your daddy was.

36:38.416 --> 36:40.350
<i>You can't help him.</i>

36:40.418 --> 36:42.752
<i>He has to want to help himself.</i>

36:46.891 --> 36:49.225
Isn't that what this was?

36:51.228 --> 36:53.863
I tell you how good
you look tonight?

36:53.931 --> 36:56.032
Save your compliments
for your girlfriend.

36:56.100 --> 36:57.534
I miss you, sugar.

36:57.601 --> 36:58.835
You miss me?

36:58.903 --> 37:00.804
No.
Don't believe you.

37:00.871 --> 37:02.706
I don't care.

37:02.773 --> 37:05.375
I'm not a perfect man, baby.

37:05.443 --> 37:07.210
You always knew that.

37:08.579 --> 37:11.147
I was 22 when
I fell in love with you.

37:11.215 --> 37:13.717
I had no idea what
kind of person you were.

37:13.784 --> 37:15.518
Come on, it was fun.

37:15.586 --> 37:18.288
Helping the state, the nation.

37:18.356 --> 37:19.956
And the problems we faced,

37:20.024 --> 37:22.359
we faced together,
like a family.

37:22.426 --> 37:24.761
It's not my fault
it's over, Bud.

37:28.966 --> 37:32.335
You're... guinea boyfriend,

37:32.403 --> 37:35.338
he's roasting you
on this Iran thing.

37:35.406 --> 37:38.508
You know, the White House
can't reach Hakam, I heard.

37:38.576 --> 37:39.876
Bullshit.

37:39.944 --> 37:42.078
Hakam is a detestable
son of a bitch

37:42.146 --> 37:44.147
who'd prefer if Israel
were a memory.

37:44.215 --> 37:47.250
He thinks the Saudis are a bunch
of greedy ragheads who want

37:47.318 --> 37:49.486
to keep the Middle East
in the Dark Ages.

37:49.553 --> 37:51.554
But he wouldn't
poke America in the eye

37:51.622 --> 37:54.924
unless he knows he's got
a deal and a handshake.

37:54.992 --> 37:57.060
Now, I'm sure you're
trying to figure out

37:57.128 --> 37:58.661
why he's killing
those journalists,

37:58.729 --> 38:00.830
but the question
you should be asking is:

38:00.898 --> 38:02.732
Why the expedited trial?

38:02.800 --> 38:04.834
Why is he moving so fast?

38:04.902 --> 38:06.936
'Cause that
only benefits one guy.

38:07.004 --> 38:08.905
You're looking for the shot.

38:08.973 --> 38:12.008
Garcetti already has the ball,

38:12.076 --> 38:14.177
and he's just
running the clock out.

38:14.245 --> 38:16.513
Why would the president do that?

38:16.580 --> 38:18.114
Why do we do anything?

38:18.182 --> 38:20.350
You know, why did I ruin
the best thing

38:20.418 --> 38:21.618
that ever happened to me?

38:21.685 --> 38:23.620
Because people
are stupid and weak.

38:23.687 --> 38:25.889
You know, my advice
is stay out of this,

38:25.956 --> 38:28.925
and if I'm right, you'll
only make an enemy of your boss.

38:28.993 --> 38:30.927
You know I can't do that.

38:32.930 --> 38:36.199
All anybody ever talks about
is your ambition.

38:36.267 --> 38:38.968
They never talk
about your heart.

38:40.704 --> 38:43.640
And I... I don't know
why they don't see it,

38:43.707 --> 38:45.942
'cause it's all I ever saw.

38:49.180 --> 38:51.114
That and, uh...

38:51.182 --> 38:53.783
you were
the foxiest piece of ass

38:53.851 --> 38:55.985
I ever laid eyes on.

39:00.024 --> 39:01.858
You still are.

39:48.405 --> 39:50.540
Oh, that was wonderful.

39:55.412 --> 39:57.313
This next one's for, uh,

39:57.381 --> 39:58.581
my bro...

39:58.649 --> 40:00.850
and his sweet-ass fiancée.

40:00.918 --> 40:02.952
Love you guys.

40:58.409 --> 41:00.710
Hey, man, you never
sent a face pic,

41:00.778 --> 41:02.612
so...

41:02.680 --> 41:03.780
Damn.

41:03.847 --> 41:05.281
You're...

41:05.349 --> 41:07.550
Let's pretend I'm not.

41:16.827 --> 41:19.796
Okay, this is gonna sound
kind of weird, but I got

41:19.863 --> 41:21.798
to tell you.
Yeah, you've wanted to sleep with me

41:21.865 --> 41:23.766
since I was a teenager
in the White House.

41:23.834 --> 41:27.503
Yeah. Well, if you shut the hell
up, now is your big chance.

41:29.673 --> 41:31.608
First she hijacked
the engagement party,

41:31.675 --> 41:34.244
and now she's just
hijacking the wedding.

41:37.781 --> 41:40.650
Look, there has to be a rule

41:40.718 --> 41:43.653
against discussing my mother
while I'm inside of you.

41:43.721 --> 41:45.655
Okay, it is your
fault, all right?

41:45.723 --> 41:47.123
We weren't finished
with the conversation,

41:47.191 --> 41:48.791
and you wanted
to start having sex.

41:50.461 --> 41:52.629
She didn't hijack
the engagement.

41:52.696 --> 41:53.830
Oh, no?
No.

41:53.897 --> 41:55.999
We wanted 60 people at a club,

41:56.066 --> 41:58.001
and we're having 300 people

41:58.068 --> 42:00.470
at the zoo, because your
mother likes elephants.

42:00.537 --> 42:02.905
There's gonna be
helicopters and...

42:02.973 --> 42:06.909
metal detectors and paparazzi
posing as busboys and... Yes.

42:08.145 --> 42:10.947
There is a tsunami of bullshit

42:11.015 --> 42:14.017
that comes
with being in my family.

42:14.084 --> 42:19.289
But don't you love me...
more than you hate all that?

42:19.356 --> 42:21.624
Mm-hmm.

42:21.692 --> 42:23.593
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

42:27.164 --> 42:29.799
And that's your mom.

42:29.867 --> 42:31.868
I know. Get it.

42:31.902 --> 42:33.670
Ask her where

42:33.737 --> 42:35.672
the Japanese ambassador
was at dinner.

42:35.739 --> 42:38.174
Tell her it's racist.
Hello?

42:38.242 --> 42:40.343
Porchov. He's coming
to the engagement party.

42:40.411 --> 42:42.078
He's in New York early.

42:42.146 --> 42:44.080
The Russian foreign minister?

42:44.148 --> 42:46.082
Yes. We need to be in New York
tomorrow morning.

42:46.150 --> 42:47.317
Don't let him know we're coming.

42:48.552 --> 42:50.653
Mom, that's in, like, six hours.

42:50.721 --> 42:53.389
I know, sweetheart.
Get cracking.

42:54.391 --> 42:55.525
Mm-hmm?

42:55.592 --> 42:57.126
Uh, I, um...

42:58.762 --> 43:01.030
I have to go.
You have to what?

43:01.098 --> 43:03.299
I have to go.
You have to go in?

43:03.367 --> 43:06.669
Mm, I could wait for her call...
Mm-hmm. Mm...

43:08.839 --> 43:11.841
Also a great day
for Bud Hammond and his girlfriend,

43:11.909 --> 43:13.943
Eva Flores.
They arrived today in DC,

43:14.011 --> 43:15.378
for his son's engagement party.

43:15.446 --> 43:17.447
Well, Eva's breasts
arrived last night,

43:17.514 --> 43:18.614
so...

43:23.721 --> 43:25.054
The former president introduced

43:25.122 --> 43:27.056
his ex-wife
to his girlfriend this evening.

43:27.124 --> 43:29.859
He's hoping that they don't
kill each other, but actually,

43:29.927 --> 43:31.394
he's really hoping
there'll be a three-way,

43:31.462 --> 43:32.962
but he'll settle
for them not killing each other.

43:41.105 --> 43:42.739
If I didn't know any better,

43:42.806 --> 43:45.041
I'd say she was
still in love with him.

43:45.109 --> 43:47.310
The way she dressed up,
kept avoiding his gaze.

43:47.378 --> 43:48.845
I mean, honestly,
it was like she

43:48.912 --> 43:50.380
was a nervous
schoolgirl around him.

43:50.447 --> 43:52.382
They were married
for over 30 years.

43:52.449 --> 43:54.417
Is it that surprising she still

43:54.485 --> 43:56.786
has feelings for him?
No, it's not... surprising.

43:56.854 --> 43:58.388
It's just sad.

43:58.455 --> 44:01.124
When Elaine Barrish
graduated law school,

44:01.191 --> 44:02.892
she gave
the valedictorian address

44:02.960 --> 44:04.527
and got a standing ovation

44:04.595 --> 44:06.062
for ten minutes.

44:06.130 --> 44:08.064
I mean, ten minutes--
can you imagine that?

44:08.132 --> 44:09.465
What happened to that girl?

44:09.533 --> 44:11.334
And how did she
decide to sit out

44:11.402 --> 44:13.136
the next 20 years
catering to a man

44:13.203 --> 44:14.804
who repeatedly cheated on her?

44:14.872 --> 44:17.173
You never told me, you know,

44:17.241 --> 44:19.409
how you snagged the interview.

44:19.476 --> 44:21.811
I'm not asking as your boss,

44:21.879 --> 44:24.046
I'm asking as your boyfriend.

44:24.114 --> 44:25.615
How'd you get it?

44:30.454 --> 44:32.889
T.J. Hammond
tried to kill himself.

44:34.558 --> 44:37.493
I have a contact
at GW Hospital.

44:37.561 --> 44:40.530
Last December,
they rushed T.J. to the E.R.,

44:40.597 --> 44:42.965
under a pseudonym, for
carbon monoxide poisoning.

44:43.033 --> 44:44.734
They swept the police report

44:44.802 --> 44:47.804
under the rug, but
not the medical ones.

44:47.871 --> 44:50.306
You told the Secretary's
office you had the story.

44:50.374 --> 44:52.308
I wasn't gonna write it.

44:52.376 --> 44:54.310
But they didn't know that.

44:54.378 --> 44:56.345
I feel creepy even
telling you about it.

44:56.413 --> 44:57.580
Why didn't you tell me?

44:57.648 --> 44:59.682
Uh, because it's not news.

44:59.750 --> 45:02.985
Or if it is, it's not news
the <i>Globe</i> should be printing.

45:03.053 --> 45:04.587
To print.

45:04.655 --> 45:06.389
There's a difference.

45:06.457 --> 45:08.858
And you just asked me
to tell you as my boyfriend,

45:08.926 --> 45:09.992
which I did.

45:10.060 --> 45:12.161
But no one else can know.

45:12.229 --> 45:14.230
Okay?

45:15.866 --> 45:18.468
All right, fine.

45:18.535 --> 45:20.736
If you got your hands
on the medical file,

45:20.804 --> 45:22.038
somebody else will.

45:22.105 --> 45:23.739
You should've said something.

45:23.807 --> 45:26.175
Uh, well, the next time
I hear news that's disgusting

45:26.243 --> 45:28.411
and exploitive,
you'll be the first to know.

45:28.479 --> 45:30.480
Good night.

45:43.422 --> 45:45.223
Thank you.

45:49.728 --> 45:52.730
I assume this trip is
concerning the journalists?

45:55.000 --> 45:57.936
Madam Secretary, I would
never write anything that

45:58.003 --> 46:00.705
would interfere with whatever
high-level talks are happening.

46:00.773 --> 46:05.176
You finally decided to acquire
some journalistic ethics.

46:05.244 --> 46:07.078
How nice for you.

46:09.448 --> 46:13.151
Still the same breakfast--
steel-cut oats and blueberries.

46:13.219 --> 46:16.521
You wouldn't remember, but I
was in your pool for two years

46:16.589 --> 46:19.123
during your ex-husband's
first run for the presidency.

46:19.191 --> 46:22.026
Before they put me on the DC desk.
I remember.

46:22.094 --> 46:23.962
You were just out of school,

46:24.029 --> 46:25.730
you had a sister at Amherst,

46:25.798 --> 46:28.399
and your mother was
a former physician.

46:28.467 --> 46:31.035
Yes.

46:31.103 --> 46:34.806
Look, I know I wrote some tough things about
you in the past... It may surprise you,

46:34.874 --> 46:37.208
Ms. Berg, but I've actually
never read your columns.

46:37.276 --> 46:39.711
If I read half of
what people wrote

46:39.778 --> 46:42.914
about me, I wouldn't get
out of bed in the morning.

46:46.552 --> 46:48.486
I did read your book.

46:48.554 --> 46:52.924
About the impending
fourth wave of feminism.

46:53.893 --> 46:55.193
Not bad.

46:55.261 --> 46:57.595
No one read my book.

46:57.663 --> 47:01.232
Well, maybe it was the title:
<i>When Bitches Rule.</i>

47:01.300 --> 47:02.934
I was trying
to reclaim the word.

47:03.002 --> 47:04.569
It might have
impacted your sales.

47:04.637 --> 47:08.139
After all,
never call a bitch a bitch.

47:08.207 --> 47:10.308
Us bitches hate that.

47:11.076 --> 47:13.144
Um...

47:13.212 --> 47:14.979
this just came in.

47:15.047 --> 47:17.148
It's not good.

47:18.584 --> 47:20.018
Here.

47:34.066 --> 47:38.369
"The Iranian court has found
the journalists guilty.

47:38.437 --> 47:40.605
"President Hakam
has set their execution

47:40.673 --> 47:42.507
for 24 hours from now."

47:48.113 --> 47:51.282
How do you do it?

47:51.350 --> 47:53.651
Even people like me who have

47:53.719 --> 47:57.689
criticized you really do...
admire your resolve.

47:57.756 --> 48:00.124
My usual answer is
that I share the ethos

48:00.192 --> 48:01.659
with most Americans.

48:01.727 --> 48:04.395
If you work hard
and give it everything you got,

48:04.463 --> 48:06.397
tomorrow will be better
than today.

48:06.465 --> 48:09.767
And the truth?

48:12.037 --> 48:14.472
Most of life is hell.

48:14.540 --> 48:16.908
It's filled with
failure and loss.

48:16.976 --> 48:19.544
People disappoint you,
dreams don't work out,

48:19.611 --> 48:23.514
hearts get broken,
innocent journalists die.

48:23.582 --> 48:27.585
And the best moments of life,
when everything comes together--

48:27.653 --> 48:29.754
are few and fleeting.

48:29.822 --> 48:32.090
But you'll never
get to the next

48:32.157 --> 48:35.093
great moment
if you don't keep going.

48:35.160 --> 48:37.261
So that's what I do.

48:37.329 --> 48:40.098
I keep going.

48:46.972 --> 48:48.473
<i>Oh!</i>

48:48.540 --> 48:50.742
I'm out!

48:50.809 --> 48:52.643
So, Viktor, what are you gonna
take off next?

48:52.711 --> 48:56.647
Please tell him, the U.S.
Secretary of State is here,

48:56.715 --> 48:58.883
and I need to see him.

48:58.951 --> 49:00.985
Viktor, you goon,
I know you're in there.

49:01.053 --> 49:02.487
It's Elaine.

49:02.554 --> 49:05.156
I need to talk to you.
I'm serious.

49:06.925 --> 49:09.727
Madam Secretary,
translator not here.

49:09.795 --> 49:11.529
Can't speak.
See you at engagement.

49:11.597 --> 49:13.231
You went to Cornell undergrad,

49:13.298 --> 49:15.400
so quit with the whole
"you don't understand me" crap.

49:15.467 --> 49:17.168
Right now I need

49:17.236 --> 49:18.669
your help. It's important.

49:18.737 --> 49:21.305
What the hell is it, Elaine?

49:21.373 --> 49:23.041
I need your help
in getting in touch

49:23.108 --> 49:24.542
with the Iranian
Ambassador to the UN.

49:24.610 --> 49:26.811
No way, cannot get involved.

49:26.879 --> 49:28.446
I'm not asking you
to get involved.

49:28.514 --> 49:30.548
I'm asking you
to get me in a room

49:30.616 --> 49:32.417
with Ambassador Jobrani,
who is in this city

49:32.484 --> 49:33.785
and won't return my calls.

49:33.852 --> 49:35.219
If my prime minister
find out about this...

49:35.287 --> 49:36.621
Oh, it's not your prime minister

49:36.688 --> 49:38.056
you should be worried about,
Viktor.

49:38.123 --> 49:39.791
It's your wife.

49:39.858 --> 49:41.759
You think I don't know
who's in there?

49:44.129 --> 49:45.763
I'm doing it,

49:45.831 --> 49:48.266
not because you threaten.

49:48.333 --> 49:52.470
Because you got balls...
and I respect balls.

49:54.073 --> 49:55.573
And a great ass.

49:55.641 --> 49:58.042
Thank you.

49:59.812 --> 50:03.414
Mr. Foreign Minister,
I came as...

50:03.482 --> 50:06.017
Mr. Ambassador,
I didn't know you were coming.

50:06.085 --> 50:07.685
I was just having tea with

50:07.753 --> 50:08.953
my buddy Viktor here.

50:09.021 --> 50:10.521
You've been
impossible to reach.

50:10.589 --> 50:12.290
Cell phone issues?

50:12.357 --> 50:14.192
We cannot be talking,
Madam Secretary.

50:14.259 --> 50:15.193
We are, Amir.

50:15.260 --> 50:16.494
Thank you, Viktor.

50:16.562 --> 50:19.397
You owe me. Mm.

50:21.066 --> 50:23.067
There is nothing
you can do, Madam Secretary.

50:23.135 --> 50:25.770
The wheels
of this are in motion.

50:25.838 --> 50:29.240
When those Americans are dead,
<i>then</i> there's nothing I can do.

50:31.410 --> 50:33.177
Now you and I go back, Amir.

50:33.245 --> 50:34.879
I know you're a good man.

50:34.947 --> 50:36.781
I also know you worked for Hakam

50:36.849 --> 50:38.616
in the private sector,
and you're close.

50:38.684 --> 50:40.451
You either know why
this is happening,

50:40.519 --> 50:42.787
or you have
a pretty good idea why.

50:42.855 --> 50:45.389
Either way, I need
to know what you know.

50:46.625 --> 50:48.359
<i>Hakam is sick.</i>

50:48.427 --> 50:50.695
Pancreatic cancer.

50:50.762 --> 50:53.331
Before he dies, he wants
to begin negotiations

50:53.398 --> 50:55.833
to freeze Iran's
nuclear program entirely.

50:55.901 --> 50:57.735
He can't forge a treaty
of real meaning

50:57.803 --> 50:59.403
without the support
of the ultraconservatives,

50:59.471 --> 51:01.839
so he takes
an aggressive action.

51:01.907 --> 51:04.041
Either he kills
some American spies,

51:04.109 --> 51:07.578
or you agree to negotiate for
their release on Iranian soil.

51:07.646 --> 51:10.248
Both are clear wins
that get him to the table.

51:10.315 --> 51:12.850
My recommendation,
Mr. President,

51:12.918 --> 51:14.252
is that either you

51:14.319 --> 51:16.254
or an emissary
from this administration

51:16.321 --> 51:19.657
meet with Hakam in Oman
and release the hostages there.

51:24.997 --> 51:27.064
But you're not going
to do that, are you?

51:27.132 --> 51:29.200
'Cause you already knew
what he was up to,

51:29.268 --> 51:31.035
and you're just
letting it happen.

51:31.103 --> 51:32.904
You've crossed some serious
lines today, Elaine.

51:32.971 --> 51:35.206
First the rogue
mission to New York,

51:35.274 --> 51:37.208
and now you accuse the
president of this?

51:37.276 --> 51:39.243
You were a lousy
campaign manager, Barry.

51:39.311 --> 51:41.412
You're a rotten Chief of Staff.

51:41.480 --> 51:44.415
And you're an even worse liar.

51:44.483 --> 51:47.618
I'd like a moment alone
with the president.

51:49.354 --> 51:51.656
Give us a minute.

51:58.697 --> 52:01.832
Yes... we knew.

52:03.101 --> 52:06.237
Harris, Samson, a few others.

52:06.305 --> 52:07.705
We knew about it,
but we didn't agree to it.

52:07.773 --> 52:09.574
I'm supposed to believe you now?

52:09.641 --> 52:12.810
After you've used my office
to quiet the press.

52:12.878 --> 52:14.612
I'm sorry about that.

52:14.680 --> 52:17.215
You don't have to believe me,
but it's the truth.

52:17.282 --> 52:20.718
Hakam floated the idea to us
through one of his contacts.

52:20.786 --> 52:22.386
We floated back a hard no.

52:22.454 --> 52:24.622
Two weeks later,
he's doing it anyway.

52:24.690 --> 52:26.924
If you knew this was a means
toward negotiation,

52:26.992 --> 52:28.492
why not meet a few demands

52:28.560 --> 52:31.362
and save the lives
of those American journalists?

52:31.430 --> 52:32.763
When we ran against each other,

52:32.831 --> 52:34.565
you were the one
who said I was an idiot

52:34.633 --> 52:36.200
for even suggesting
that we sit down with Iran.

52:36.268 --> 52:37.568
I would look foolish
under these circumstances

52:37.636 --> 52:38.970
doing the same thing.

52:39.037 --> 52:40.538
And I lost.

52:40.606 --> 52:42.073
Be glad you did.

52:42.140 --> 52:44.909
I was a dog chasing a car,
and I caught a bus.

52:44.977 --> 52:46.611
The economy's in freefall,

52:46.678 --> 52:48.646
I can't pass one piece
of legislation through Congress.

52:48.714 --> 52:50.715
I go on TV to try to
communicate a vision,

52:50.782 --> 52:52.383
and America collectively
turns me off

52:52.451 --> 52:55.386
to watch drunk housewives
and singing competitions.

52:55.454 --> 52:57.154
I have been here before.

52:57.222 --> 52:58.923
I have stood in this office

52:58.991 --> 53:01.092
when Bud faced darker hours
than these,

53:01.159 --> 53:04.161
and I'm telling you-- now is not
the time to be discouraged.

53:04.229 --> 53:05.730
Now is the time to lead.

53:05.797 --> 53:07.465
I'm not your ex-husband, Elaine.

53:09.468 --> 53:12.470
The goal is a nuclear treaty
with Iran.

53:12.537 --> 53:14.972
This isn't how
I wanted to get it.

53:15.040 --> 53:16.607
I tried to stop it.

53:18.477 --> 53:20.845
But I'm gonna take it.

53:22.447 --> 53:24.382
Now, you, uh...

53:24.449 --> 53:26.917
go focus on your son's party.

53:26.985 --> 53:29.387
There's nothing more
you can do here.

53:29.454 --> 53:33.157
It's not enough to have
the courage of <i>your</i> convictions.

53:33.225 --> 53:35.559
You have to have the courage
of others', too.

53:35.627 --> 53:39.463
Those were your words
during our last debate.

53:39.531 --> 53:41.232
The voters believed you.

53:41.300 --> 53:42.933
I believed you.

53:43.001 --> 53:44.568
Some days, sir,

53:44.636 --> 53:48.306
it would be nice to be working
for the man who beat me.

53:55.414 --> 53:57.615
The only thing I hate worse
than being wrong about something

53:57.683 --> 53:59.016
is your father
being right about...

53:59.084 --> 54:01.485
It's out.

54:01.553 --> 54:03.954
How long?

54:04.022 --> 54:05.356
Ten minutes.

54:05.424 --> 54:08.059
Oh, my God.

54:10.495 --> 54:12.530
<i>"According to files</i>

"The report is the
latest unfortunate event

54:54.639 --> 54:58.142
in the troubled life of
the former first son."

54:58.210 --> 55:00.478
Where's your brother?

55:00.545 --> 55:03.013
I've been trying him.
Find him. Now.

55:03.081 --> 55:05.216
Yeah.

55:05.283 --> 55:07.718
Our time together
is done. Get out.

55:07.786 --> 55:09.320
Madam Secretary,
I can assure you,

55:09.388 --> 55:11.155
I had nothing to do with this.

55:11.223 --> 55:12.590
I don't care. Get out.

55:12.657 --> 55:14.258
I wasn't even aware
there was anyone

55:14.326 --> 55:15.893
at my paper
even looking into it.

55:15.961 --> 55:17.762
Really, I am as upset
as you are.

55:17.829 --> 55:19.563
You couldn't possibly
be as upset as I am.

55:19.631 --> 55:22.266
Was it your child
you found barely alive?

55:22.334 --> 55:23.267
Was it?!

55:23.335 --> 55:24.735
No. It seems

55:24.803 --> 55:26.237
the story missed a few details.

55:26.304 --> 55:27.838
But what do you care?

55:27.906 --> 55:29.740
To you people,
my son has always been

55:29.808 --> 55:31.609
just another drug-addicted
cautionary tale,

55:31.676 --> 55:34.445
responsible for all
of his own misfortunes.

55:34.513 --> 55:38.215
But he was the first
openly gay child of a president.

55:38.283 --> 55:41.285
You will never know the vitriol,

55:41.353 --> 55:43.621
the evil he suffered

55:43.688 --> 55:45.790
when he came out--
against his will--

55:45.857 --> 55:48.259
as a boy in the White House.

55:48.326 --> 55:50.628
And yet, you trade on his pain
and suffering

55:50.695 --> 55:52.863
to coerce me
into this interview.

55:52.931 --> 55:54.765
Where is that in
this story? Huh?

55:54.833 --> 55:56.300
Where in there

55:56.368 --> 55:59.069
does it say
what kind of person you are?

55:59.137 --> 56:01.539
The only good news
I've gotten all week

56:01.606 --> 56:04.241
is that I don't have to share
the same space with you anymore.

56:04.309 --> 56:05.676
Now get the hell out!

56:35.407 --> 56:38.275
Hi. It's me.

56:38.343 --> 56:40.845
I need to see you.

56:40.912 --> 56:43.247
Right away.

56:47.950 --> 56:49.584
<i>The Washington Globe</i> reports
exclusively tonight

56:49.651 --> 56:51.185
that T.J. Hammond,

56:51.253 --> 56:54.021
son of Secretary of State
Elaine Barrish and

56:54.089 --> 56:56.257
former President Bud Hammond,
was admitted

56:56.325 --> 56:59.494
to Washington General Hospital
on December 22, 2011,

56:59.561 --> 57:01.162
after a failed suicide attempt.

57:01.230 --> 57:02.730
Damn!
That sucks, yo.

57:02.798 --> 57:04.966
Medical records obtained
by the <i>Globe</i> indicate

57:05.033 --> 57:06.367
he was unconscious
upon admittance.

57:06.435 --> 57:07.969
You better now?
Much. Give me the usual.

57:08.036 --> 57:09.770
And he was treated for hypoxia,

57:09.838 --> 57:12.006
which is a condition caused
by carbon monoxide poisoning,

57:12.074 --> 57:16.043
fueling assumptions that this
was indeed a suicide attempt.

57:16.111 --> 57:18.479
He was also admitted
under the alias of Aaron Reed.

57:18.547 --> 57:20.648
Your mom? Your mom is hot.

57:20.716 --> 57:22.984
You got to give
me her autograph.

57:23.051 --> 57:27.155
I need a picture of her in one
of them bad-ass Chanel suits.

57:27.222 --> 57:28.856
I want her to put,

57:28.924 --> 57:32.226
"To Omar, my finest
black sweet meat.

57:32.294 --> 57:33.694
Love, Elaine."

57:35.497 --> 57:37.832
Yeah. I mean, she don't got
to put, "love."

57:37.900 --> 57:40.001
She can just put "xo."

57:41.637 --> 57:43.437
Oh, it's my bro.

57:43.505 --> 57:46.774
He keeps calling.
I gotta get this.

57:46.842 --> 57:48.776
Hey.

57:48.844 --> 57:50.211
Yeah, hey. There you are.

57:50.279 --> 57:52.213
I've been trying
to get a hold of you.

57:52.281 --> 57:53.548
Did you, um...?

57:53.615 --> 57:55.283
Did you see it yet?

57:55.350 --> 57:57.185
Yeah. It's all bullshit.

57:57.252 --> 57:58.886
Don't worry about it.

57:58.954 --> 58:00.721
Hey, where are you now?

58:00.789 --> 58:02.256
I'm with my sponsor.

58:02.324 --> 58:04.525
Worry about your party, bro.

58:04.593 --> 58:07.328
I'm all good, I swear.

58:07.396 --> 58:10.097
I love you.

58:21.643 --> 58:23.044
Did you reach him?

58:23.111 --> 58:25.713
Uh, yeah, yeah,
I just talked to him.

58:25.781 --> 58:28.616
He, uh... he says
he's with his sponsor.

58:28.684 --> 58:30.084
I-I know. He's lying.

58:30.152 --> 58:31.919
Look,

58:31.987 --> 58:34.322
I'm supposed to pick up my tux
with Anne in a half-hour,

58:34.389 --> 58:36.524
but I'm gonna track him down,
and I will call you back

58:36.592 --> 58:38.192
when I'm with him, all right?
Where are you?

58:38.260 --> 58:40.661
I'm following a lead.

58:40.729 --> 58:41.896
And Douglas?

58:41.964 --> 58:43.264
Yeah?

58:43.332 --> 58:46.500
You are a good brother...
and a good son.

58:46.568 --> 58:48.970
I'll call you.

59:41.056 --> 59:44.125
Thanks for coming.

59:44.192 --> 59:47.728
I'm having one of the worst days
of my life and...

59:47.796 --> 59:50.231
you're still the one person
who can make me feel

59:50.299 --> 59:55.169
like everything is going
to be okay...

59:55.237 --> 59:57.238
even when it's not.

01:00:01.643 --> 01:00:03.644
Come here, sugar.

01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:20.027
<i>Congrats, Georgia,
we're so happy for you.</i>

01:00:25.167 --> 01:00:28.202
Oh, hey, Susan.

01:00:30.372 --> 01:00:31.639
I'm sure you're pretty upset

01:00:31.707 --> 01:00:33.941
over the whole
Hammond suicide story.

01:00:34.009 --> 01:00:36.544
I'm really sorry if it stepped
on your Barrish piece,

01:00:36.611 --> 01:00:38.012
but I had a source come forward

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:41.182
and I, I just-- I
had to run with it.

01:00:41.249 --> 01:00:42.283
Of all the industries
available to you,

01:00:42.351 --> 01:00:43.651
looking the way you do--

01:00:43.719 --> 01:00:46.654
porn, reality hosting--
you chose journalism.

01:00:46.722 --> 01:00:48.956
Why? You don't care
about its history.

01:00:49.024 --> 01:00:50.991
You have no sense
of regard for what we do

01:00:51.059 --> 01:00:52.893
or who's come before you,
just like you have no regard

01:00:52.961 --> 01:00:54.462
for the life on the other end
of that piece.

01:00:54.529 --> 01:00:58.366
You're not mad
I ran that story.

01:00:58.433 --> 01:01:02.536
You're just mad
it cost you one... bitch.

01:01:03.905 --> 01:01:07.041
You're gonna regret
you ever posted this.

01:01:07.109 --> 01:01:09.176
Oh, and, uh, Georgia...

01:01:09.244 --> 01:01:11.979
never call a bitch a bitch.

01:01:13.081 --> 01:01:14.382
Us bitches hate that.

01:01:14.449 --> 01:01:17.918
Your boyfriend knew about it.

01:01:17.986 --> 01:01:20.888
He had to approve it
before I could post it.

01:01:24.726 --> 01:01:26.327
I warned you this kind
of thing could happen,

01:01:26.395 --> 01:01:28.028
that it could get out.
Well, then you come to me

01:01:28.096 --> 01:01:29.497
and you tell me.

01:01:31.833 --> 01:01:35.102
Why, so you can
tell me to stop it?

01:01:35.170 --> 01:01:37.505
Uh, yeah. That is exactly
the kind of conflict

01:01:37.572 --> 01:01:39.340
of interest I cannot
have in my life.

01:01:39.408 --> 01:01:41.342
W-W-What are we,
a-a newspaper

01:01:41.410 --> 01:01:42.376
or a gossip site?

01:01:42.444 --> 01:01:44.378
We're a dying institution.

01:01:44.446 --> 01:01:46.080
50 years from now, people are
gonna talk about newspapers

01:01:46.148 --> 01:01:49.016
the way we talk
about rotary phones or disco.

01:01:51.253 --> 01:01:54.255
Did you give Georgia the story?

01:01:55.657 --> 01:01:58.192
No, y-you asked me
not to tell anyone.

01:01:59.261 --> 01:02:02.196
Are you sleeping with her?

01:02:05.267 --> 01:02:08.202
Yeah, okay, you-you're,
you are paranoid and...

01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:09.703
Seriously, is this
what hanging out

01:02:09.771 --> 01:02:10.971
with Elaine Barrish
does to you?

01:02:11.039 --> 01:02:14.742
Are you sleeping with her?

01:02:14.810 --> 01:02:17.044
I'm not going
to answer that question.

01:02:17.112 --> 01:02:19.847
You just did.

01:02:50.145 --> 01:02:52.580
I-I screwed up, I know.

01:02:52.647 --> 01:02:54.582
I... I screwed up.

01:02:54.649 --> 01:02:56.317
Susan, we have been
together for two years.

01:02:56.384 --> 01:02:58.152
I had to beg you
to move in with me.

01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:00.721
When friends ask
if we're getting married,

01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:02.756
you say no with-without
even looking at me, you say,

01:03:02.824 --> 01:03:05.092
"I don't believe in it and
Alex failed at it twice.

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:06.727
That's why I picked him."

01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:10.464
Name one time that you've
spent as much energy

01:03:10.532 --> 01:03:13.801
on something for us as you have
on this Barrish piece.

01:03:13.869 --> 01:03:15.736
Even now, I mean,
I-I can't,

01:03:15.804 --> 01:03:18.305
I can't tell if you're more
upset that I slept with Georgia

01:03:18.373 --> 01:03:19.907
or that I gave her the story.
Wow,

01:03:19.975 --> 01:03:21.275
for a second I thought
I was gonna get

01:03:21.343 --> 01:03:23.744
the "I'm sorry
I hurt you" speech.

01:03:23.812 --> 01:03:25.279
Let's be clear.

01:03:25.347 --> 01:03:27.281
I am definitely more upset
that you stuck your dick

01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:29.783
in another woman
than I am about the story.

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:33.554
You know that I'm sorry.

01:03:33.622 --> 01:03:35.723
You don't make it easy,

01:03:35.790 --> 01:03:37.925
you don't make it
easy to love you.

01:03:37.993 --> 01:03:42.563
It's not supposed
to be easy, you asshole.

01:03:42.631 --> 01:03:44.164
Easy is Georgia.

01:03:44.232 --> 01:03:46.567
Easy is where
you can spend the night

01:03:46.635 --> 01:03:48.636
while I'm moving out.

01:03:54.242 --> 01:03:58.312
I think we broke a couple
of mattress springs.

01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:01.815
Oh, that was for sure top ten.

01:04:01.883 --> 01:04:04.251
Oh, not even close.

01:04:04.319 --> 01:04:07.254
Unlike you...

01:04:07.322 --> 01:04:09.490
I'm out of practice.

01:04:09.558 --> 01:04:12.159
How's T.J. doing?

01:04:12.227 --> 01:04:14.194
I tried calling him, but
he won't take my calls.

01:04:14.262 --> 01:04:15.629
Not now.

01:04:15.697 --> 01:04:17.865
Dougie's looking for him.

01:04:17.933 --> 01:04:21.869
I don't know, Bud, we can't
just make him go to rehab--

01:04:21.937 --> 01:04:23.671
we tried that twice--

01:04:23.738 --> 01:04:27.107
and we can't give him money
for another failed venture.

01:04:27.175 --> 01:04:28.943
I don't know what to do.

01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:33.914
I must be the highest-ranking
codependent in the country.

01:04:33.982 --> 01:04:37.418
It was so much simpler when
they were boys just, you know,

01:04:37.485 --> 01:04:41.255
yelling at us about
the Secret Service detail

01:04:41.323 --> 01:04:43.991
or how come they weren't
allowed to learn to drive

01:04:44.059 --> 01:04:46.293
on the road like
regular 16-year-olds.

01:04:46.361 --> 01:04:48.295
Yeah, it was simpler.

01:04:48.363 --> 01:04:52.266
Man, we had some good times.

01:04:52.334 --> 01:04:55.502
Some fun times.

01:05:03.178 --> 01:05:05.112
I'd like to propose
to the president

01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:09.984
that he send you to Iran

01:05:10.051 --> 01:05:14.188
as a last-ditch effort to
negotiate for these journalists.

01:05:15.223 --> 01:05:17.157
Hakam may not go for it,

01:05:17.225 --> 01:05:19.693
but it's, it's worth a try.

01:05:20.729 --> 01:05:22.663
Thought you'd never ask.

01:05:22.731 --> 01:05:23.998
What?

01:05:24.065 --> 01:05:25.833
I figured you'd come to me.

01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:27.534
It's not like
President Sinatra's

01:05:27.602 --> 01:05:29.470
lifting a GD finger.

01:05:29.537 --> 01:05:32.306
Besides, I know Hakam, I know
the players on the ground,

01:05:32.374 --> 01:05:34.975
and the Iranian people love me.

01:05:35.043 --> 01:05:38.646
They called me President Khoob--
that means "the good President."

01:05:38.713 --> 01:05:41.015
Is that what this was about?

01:05:41.082 --> 01:05:43.651
The "I missed you, sugar"
and "You're still

01:05:43.718 --> 01:05:45.653
the foxiest piece of ass
I ever saw."

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.488
It was just bullshit?

01:05:47.555 --> 01:05:48.922
I meant every word of it;
I always do.

01:05:48.990 --> 01:05:51.325
No, you just wanted me
to get Garcetti

01:05:51.393 --> 01:05:55.596
to send you to Iran so you could
get back in the game,

01:05:55.664 --> 01:05:57.231
and I fell for it?

01:05:57.298 --> 01:05:59.533
I am the best person to get
those journalists back,

01:05:59.601 --> 01:06:00.534
and you know it.

01:06:00.602 --> 01:06:01.702
Shit.

01:06:01.770 --> 01:06:02.703
I mean, you weren't pissed

01:06:02.771 --> 01:06:04.171
because I wanted you to ask me.

01:06:04.239 --> 01:06:06.073
You were pissed
because I thought of it first.

01:06:06.141 --> 01:06:08.509
And I wasn't playing you any
more than you were playing me.

01:06:08.576 --> 01:06:10.911
Did we sleep together
because of politics?

01:06:10.979 --> 01:06:13.280
Sure, but it was also about

01:06:13.348 --> 01:06:15.349
love.

01:06:15.417 --> 01:06:18.085
Always about both with us,
baby, that's our story.

01:06:18.153 --> 01:06:19.753
Now, we were made
for each other.

01:06:19.821 --> 01:06:22.523
Now, we were made to fight
for this country together,

01:06:22.590 --> 01:06:25.125
and we're not done fighting,
not by a long shot.

01:06:25.193 --> 01:06:26.694
You are crazy.

01:06:26.761 --> 01:06:27.795
I love you, sugar,

01:06:27.862 --> 01:06:30.297
and if you think for a second

01:06:30.365 --> 01:06:31.565
I'm giving up on us,

01:06:31.633 --> 01:06:32.866
then you don't know me

01:06:32.934 --> 01:06:34.635
and you never did.

01:06:34.703 --> 01:06:35.636
We are done.

01:06:35.704 --> 01:06:38.305
Do you hear me?

01:06:38.373 --> 01:06:39.373
Done!

01:06:39.441 --> 01:06:41.442
Asshole.

01:06:47.615 --> 01:06:50.284
Thank you.

01:06:55.290 --> 01:06:57.124
That's my girl.

01:07:14.509 --> 01:07:17.211
Oh, God.

01:07:17.278 --> 01:07:18.212
Oh.

01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:27.554
Excuse me.

01:07:27.622 --> 01:07:28.922
Um...

01:07:33.328 --> 01:07:35.229
Hello, Madam Secretary.

01:07:35.296 --> 01:07:36.797
Did Douglas call?

01:07:36.865 --> 01:07:38.565
No, but I have a list of others,

01:07:38.633 --> 01:07:42.669
including Susan Berg,
who's tried you several times.

01:07:42.737 --> 01:07:44.571
Get her back.

01:07:44.639 --> 01:07:46.907
I'll hold.

01:08:01.756 --> 01:08:04.224
Thank you for seeing me.

01:08:04.292 --> 01:08:08.262
I, uh, I wanted to apologize.

01:08:08.329 --> 01:08:10.898
I found out the
story was my fault.

01:08:10.965 --> 01:08:12.766
I inadvertently leaked it.

01:08:14.369 --> 01:08:17.437
I told my editor,
who I'm sleeping with.

01:08:17.505 --> 01:08:19.540
He told the other woman
he's also sleeping with--

01:08:19.607 --> 01:08:20.941
a fellow journalist.

01:08:21.009 --> 01:08:23.544
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:08:23.611 --> 01:08:25.078
Genuinely.

01:08:25.145 --> 01:08:27.381
Yeah, thought
you'd appreciate the irony.

01:08:27.448 --> 01:08:29.448
That may be the meanest
thing you've said about me.

01:08:29.517 --> 01:08:31.718
Oh, you haven't read my columns;
they were pretty mean.

01:08:31.786 --> 01:08:34.755
I may have read a
few of your columns.

01:08:34.823 --> 01:08:39.158
For years, I wrote about you

01:08:39.227 --> 01:08:41.094
being an affront to women
because you stayed

01:08:41.162 --> 01:08:42.729
with your husband.

01:08:42.796 --> 01:08:44.631
Like most, I-I believed
it was because

01:08:44.698 --> 01:08:47.801
of your political ambitions.

01:08:47.868 --> 01:08:49.770
Then, when I went
to pack tonight,

01:08:49.837 --> 01:08:53.841
it was one of the hardest things
I've ever had to do.

01:08:55.042 --> 01:08:58.245
I stayed because I loved him.

01:08:58.313 --> 01:09:01.215
I know.

01:09:01.282 --> 01:09:03.283
So why'd you finally leave?

01:09:05.319 --> 01:09:08.788
Because after 30 years--

01:09:08.857 --> 01:09:12.893
in that moment, exhausted
from the campaign--

01:09:12.961 --> 01:09:16.162
I finally had the strength to.

01:09:16.231 --> 01:09:17.898
I never answer

01:09:17.966 --> 01:09:21.501
the question because
there is no article,

01:09:21.569 --> 01:09:24.571
no book that can explain
the complexities

01:09:24.639 --> 01:09:27.407
of a single marriage.

01:09:29.644 --> 01:09:31.578
I'm gonna give you a headline

01:09:31.645 --> 01:09:32.912
that should supplant

01:09:32.981 --> 01:09:35.682
the whirlwind currently
surrounding my son.

01:09:36.551 --> 01:09:37.484
We'll be postponing

01:09:37.551 --> 01:09:39.252
the engagement a few days.

01:09:39.319 --> 01:09:41.121
Bud is going to Iran.

01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:43.256
The president is sending him?
The president

01:09:43.323 --> 01:09:45.158
hasn't agreed to it,
but he will.

01:09:45.225 --> 01:09:48.929
I'm meeting him in an hour,
and I'm giving him a choice...

01:09:48.997 --> 01:09:53.300
Either he sends my ex-husband
or he accepts my resignation.

01:09:53.368 --> 01:09:55.435
Now, you've just heard that

01:09:55.503 --> 01:09:58.005
from a very high-level
source at State.

01:09:58.072 --> 01:09:59.439
I want to be on that plane.

01:09:59.507 --> 01:10:01.308
Oh, Ms. Berg.
If it goes awry, it'll be

01:10:01.376 --> 01:10:03.010
background for my piece on you,

01:10:03.077 --> 01:10:06.046
but if the current Secretary
of State sends her ex-husband

01:10:06.114 --> 01:10:08.482
to rescue a bunch
of hostages in Iran

01:10:08.549 --> 01:10:11.785
and it works, I want that story.

01:10:11.853 --> 01:10:14.688
I-I need that story.

01:10:14.756 --> 01:10:17.524
We'll be in touch.

01:10:24.265 --> 01:10:26.733
Beautiful creatures,
aren't they?

01:10:26.801 --> 01:10:30.804
Majestic, fearsome

01:10:30.872 --> 01:10:32.572
but still gentle.

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:34.041
They move slower

01:10:34.108 --> 01:10:37.244
than most animals, but
they travel just as far.

01:10:37.312 --> 01:10:40.347
But that isn't what
I love most about them.

01:10:40.415 --> 01:10:43.016
They are a matriarchal society,

01:10:43.084 --> 01:10:46.820
and when the males
reach their mating age,

01:10:46.888 --> 01:10:51.591
the females kick them
the hell out of the herd.

01:11:01.836 --> 01:11:03.770
Russ, it's me.

01:11:03.838 --> 01:11:06.440
Okay, write this down
exactly as I say it.

01:11:06.507 --> 01:11:09.009
High-level sources at the
State Department are confirming

01:11:09.077 --> 01:11:11.044
that Secretary of State
Elaine Barrish

01:11:11.112 --> 01:11:13.814
will recommend
to President Garcetti...

01:11:30.465 --> 01:11:32.766
Can you keep a secret, Clark?

01:11:32.834 --> 01:11:36.336
That's my job, Madam Secretary.

01:11:36.404 --> 01:11:39.239
I'm gonna run
for president again,

01:11:39.307 --> 01:11:41.742
and this time...

01:11:41.809 --> 01:11:43.810
I'm gonna win.
