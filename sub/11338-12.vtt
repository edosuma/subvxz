00:05.267 --> 00:07.067
Radio: Joe, what's your 20?

00:07.068 --> 00:08.669
Almost done with rounds.

00:08.670 --> 00:10.137
Just checking the carousel.

00:10.138 --> 00:13.306
You need some backup?
I'm falling asleep here.

00:13.307 --> 00:16.479
No. But could you leave a
cupful of coffee in the pot?

00:16.480 --> 00:18.950
[gears cranking]

00:18.951 --> 00:22.463
Ha ha ha ha ha!

Anyone back here?

00:55.104 --> 00:56.104
[clinking]

00:56.105 --> 00:58.671
This is private property.

00:58.672 --> 01:02.004
I'm gonna give you 5 seconds to come on out.

01:03.706 --> 01:05.170
[motor starting]

01:10.372 --> 01:12.204
[loud carousel music plays]

01:12.205 --> 01:16.073
Ha ha ha ha ha!

01:16.074 --> 01:17.073
Hee hee hee!

01:17.074 --> 01:18.240
Funny, don.

01:18.241 --> 01:20.441
Heh heh. I'm a man of simple pleasures,

01:20.442 --> 01:22.041
And that was one of them.

01:22.042 --> 01:23.308
What are you doing back here?

01:23.309 --> 01:26.009
Switching out a timing belt.
What are you doing back here?

01:26.010 --> 01:27.743
Thought I saw someone messing around.

01:27.744 --> 01:29.110
Nah, it was just me.

01:29.111 --> 01:31.511
It wasn't you.

01:34.113 --> 01:35.313
Turn it off.

01:35.314 --> 01:36.380
What?

01:36.381 --> 01:38.148
Turn it off!

01:38.149 --> 01:40.283
[motor powers down]

01:43.553 --> 01:44.720
What?

02:01.731 --> 02:02.930
Ed?

02:02.931 --> 02:03.930
Go ahead.

02:03.931 --> 02:05.598
You need to send that backup.

02:12.095 --> 02:14.863
[mouthing silently]

02:21.566 --> 02:23.700
I see checkmate in 5. What do you see?

02:23.701 --> 02:26.202
I see it in 3.

02:41.012 --> 02:42.612
We've missed you out here.

02:42.613 --> 02:44.012
Thank you.

02:44.013 --> 02:46.781
Thanks. I, uh, I had to take a little break.

02:46.782 --> 02:48.081
How come?

02:48.082 --> 02:50.382
I used to play with a c
o-worker friend of mine.

02:50.383 --> 02:52.383
He's probably the best mind
I ever went up against.

02:52.384 --> 02:55.552
One day, he just decided that
he didn't want to play anymore.

02:55.553 --> 02:57.119
So you gave up, too?

02:57.120 --> 02:58.520
Just the opposite. I attempted to play

02:58.521 --> 03:00.688
Through every permutation
of moves on a chessboard.

03:00.689 --> 03:02.322
That's an infinite number of games.

03:02.323 --> 03:04.690
It's not infinite. It's just-
it's exponentially large.

03:04.691 --> 03:06.891
You couldn't have played through them all.

03:06.892 --> 03:10.060
There's an average of
40 moves per chess game,

03:10.061 --> 03:11.694
And I'll tell you something-
the more I played,

03:11.695 --> 03:14.296
The more I realized that every single match,

03:14.297 --> 03:15.663
Every single chess game,

03:15.664 --> 03:19.332
Is really just a simple variation
on the exact same theme.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.400
You know? It's aggressive opening,

03:21.401 --> 03:24.068
Patient mid-game, inevitable checkmate,

03:24.069 --> 03:26.536
And I realized why my friend quit.

03:26.537 --> 03:29.004
He was tired of repeating
the exsame patterns

03:29.005 --> 03:30.772
And expecting a different outcome.

03:30.773 --> 03:31.939
So you have a lifetime

03:31.940 --> 03:34.474
[cell phone rings] of chess
strategy in your head

03:34.475 --> 03:35.742
And you're just sitting on it.

03:35.743 --> 03:36.776
I still use it.

03:36.777 --> 03:38.977
I just, uh... I apply it differently.

03:38.978 --> 03:40.012
I have to go.

03:40.013 --> 03:42.247
It was good seeing you.

03:44.250 --> 03:46.317
Rita stuart, 25,

03:46.318 --> 03:48.619
Second victim in atlantic city.

03:48.620 --> 03:50.786
Pretty public spot for a dump site.

03:50.787 --> 03:53.687
You know, technically, I think it
would qualify more as a disposal site.

03:53.688 --> 03:56.489
You don't leave a body on a merr
y-go-round out of convenience.

03:56.490 --> 03:58.057
He took some time with her
appearance, didn't he?

03:58.058 --> 03:59.625
Yeah. Her nails were polished,

03:59.626 --> 04:01.293
Her hair was cut, clothes were brand-new.

04:01.294 --> 04:03.928
Wants her to look her best when found.
That's a lot of remorse.

04:03.929 --> 04:05.363
Who is victim number one?

04:05.364 --> 04:06.831
Stacia jackson, 29.

04:06.832 --> 04:08.299
She was found at a local playground.

04:08.300 --> 04:10.334
A change in victimology.

04:10.335 --> 04:11.768
What's the connection between these women?

04:11.769 --> 04:13.836
Jj: There is none. Rita was married,
stacia was single.

04:13.837 --> 04:16.738
Rita worked at a diner,
stacia was a corporate lawyer.

04:16.740 --> 04:18.173
According to their credit cards,

04:18.173 --> 04:20.242
They never came within
10 miles of each other.

04:20.243 --> 04:22.077
Both women were taken 2 months ago?

04:22.077 --> 04:23.745
Yeah. They lived such
completely different lives,

04:23.746 --> 04:26.683
The police didn't tie their
abduction together until now.

04:26.684 --> 04:28.586
Was there any evidence of sexual assault?

04:28.587 --> 04:31.122
There was no evidence
of violence of any kind.

04:31.123 --> 04:32.957
So how did they die?

04:32.958 --> 04:35.293
Rita had a stroke,
stacia had a brain hemorrhage.

04:35.294 --> 04:36.561
Look at this, the unsub gave
them a battery of drugs--

04:36.562 --> 04:39.530
Atracurium, doxacurium.
These are neural inhibitors.

04:39.531 --> 04:41.966
They block signals from
the brain to the muscles.

04:41.967 --> 04:44.469
He put them in medical comas for 2 months.

04:44.470 --> 04:46.705
Actually, they weren't in a coma.
You'd need phenobarbital

04:46.706 --> 04:49.507
To keep them unconscious,
and they didn't have that.

04:49.508 --> 04:52.677
So, wait a minute. These victims were
paralyzed but they were still conscious?

04:52.678 --> 04:53.978
They could open their eyes, hear,

04:53.979 --> 04:55.847
Probably even feel stimulation.

04:55.848 --> 04:57.949
Physical immobility but mental awareness.

04:57.950 --> 05:00.851
This unsub wants total domination over them.

05:00.852 --> 05:04.589
And he turns their bodies
into prisons to do it.

06:17.806 --> 06:22.008
A great many of us are

06:22.009 --> 06:26.611
Keeping women in a conscious
paralysis reads as sadism.

06:26.612 --> 06:28.313
Definitely dehumanizing,

06:28.314 --> 06:30.314
Reducing them to objects.

06:30.315 --> 06:32.116
But there's nothing else about this profile

06:32.117 --> 06:33.584
That takes us down that path.

06:33.585 --> 06:35.619
Jj: These women were found
in excellent condition.

06:35.620 --> 06:36.786
There was no evidence of bed sores,

06:36.787 --> 06:38.521
They were well fed through an I.V.

06:38.522 --> 06:40.089
His access to I.V.S and drugs--

06:40.090 --> 06:41.857
He almost certainly has medical training.

06:41.858 --> 06:44.292
Are we sure this is a he?

06:44.293 --> 06:46.828
The care this unsub shows these victims,

06:46.829 --> 06:48.596
Although they are dehumanized,

06:48.597 --> 06:50.397
The profile says female.

06:50.398 --> 06:52.031
What about the postmortem posing?

06:52.032 --> 06:54.633
That's a lot of dead weight
for a woman to carry.

06:54.634 --> 06:57.502
These women are petite.
They're under 100 pounds.

06:57.503 --> 06:59.803
All right, if we reconsider the
gender of the profile, what changes?

06:59.804 --> 07:02.171
Nothing. If anything, it fits better.

07:02.172 --> 07:05.807
Men kill to fulfill a sexual
compulsion. Women don't.

07:05.808 --> 07:07.508
Reid: You see this in
angel of mercy killers,

07:07.509 --> 07:09.042
Like genene jones and amy archer.

07:09.043 --> 07:10.544
They didn't care about race or hair color.

07:10.545 --> 07:11.711
It's men that do.

07:11.712 --> 07:13.180
Damn straight. Men do.

07:13.181 --> 07:16.716
Well, hello, red. Look at you. Guys.

07:16.717 --> 07:18.351
Wow. Wow.

07:18.352 --> 07:19.853
Garcia, what did you find
out about the clothing

07:19.854 --> 07:21.154
The unsub's dressing the victims in?

07:21.155 --> 07:23.324
At first only that both
garments were made from chiffon,

07:23.325 --> 07:25.694
But with the wonder twin powers
of the atlantic city police

07:25.695 --> 07:27.162
And my impeccable eye for fashion,

07:27.163 --> 07:30.998
We have also determined that these
garments fit ridiculously well.

07:30.999 --> 07:34.134
They're super flattering to each
victim's exact measurements,

07:34.135 --> 07:37.336
Kind of exactly like the unsub
whipped them up herself.

07:37.337 --> 07:38.737
Maybe that's what connects the victims.

07:38.738 --> 07:39.905
How so?

07:39.906 --> 07:42.740
Maybe she isn't just killing petite women

07:42.741 --> 07:45.375
Because they're easier to abduct and pose

07:45.376 --> 07:47.077
But because of a physical type.

07:47.078 --> 07:48.345
She wants a body type.

07:48.346 --> 07:50.913
Sewing clothes for a specific size of woman.

07:50.914 --> 07:52.814
Please tell me she is
not killing these women

07:52.815 --> 07:54.383
Because she needs human models.

07:54.384 --> 07:56.252
I mean, there's gotta
be more to it than that.

07:56.253 --> 07:57.587
There probably is.

07:57.588 --> 07:59.856
But at least we have a
start on the victimology.

07:59.857 --> 08:02.758
Prentiss and morgan, I want you to
interview the victims' families.

08:02.759 --> 08:04.326
Talk to them about lifestyle choices.

08:04.327 --> 08:06.728
Any body image issues
these women may have had.

08:06.729 --> 08:08.963
Reid, go to rita stuart's autopsy,

08:08.964 --> 08:10.998
See if the drugs point to any
specific medical training

08:10.999 --> 08:12.366
The unsub might have had.

08:12.367 --> 08:14.334
Dave and I will go to the disposal site.

08:14.335 --> 08:16.003
And, garcia. Sir.

08:16.004 --> 08:17.504
I want you to check missing persons reports

08:17.505 --> 08:18.905
For the last 2 months. See if any abductions

08:18.906 --> 08:20.873
Match what we know. We need to find out

08:20.874 --> 08:24.043
If the unsub's already taken another victim.

08:29.849 --> 08:32.116
Agent jareau? Detective marty cotrone.

08:32.116 --> 08:35.385
Hi. These are ssas morgan and prentiss.

08:35.386 --> 08:36.721
Were you able to contact the families?

08:36.722 --> 08:37.722
They're already here.

08:37.722 --> 08:39.357
Did they bring the pictures we asked for?

08:39.357 --> 08:42.059
Yeah. They were pretty confused by that.

08:42.061 --> 08:44.662
And to be honest, so am I.

08:45.464 --> 08:47.531
Agent morgan, I don't understand.

08:47.532 --> 08:48.966
How does what my daughter looked like

08:48.967 --> 08:51.467
Have to do with the monster who killed her?

08:51.468 --> 08:54.236
We think the unsub is
looking for a physical type.

08:54.237 --> 08:56.638
Fit but petite.

08:56.639 --> 08:59.473
This is her. This is my wife.

08:59.474 --> 09:02.809
Did rita work out, stay in shape?

09:02.810 --> 09:04.144
Sure. I guess.

09:04.145 --> 09:06.315
She went to the gym at least 3 times a week.

09:06.316 --> 09:09.354
Stacia took pride in every
aspect of her appearance.

09:09.355 --> 09:10.355
In what way?

09:10.356 --> 09:11.490
You know, her clothes.

09:11.491 --> 09:12.958
It was her clothes. She loved to shop.

09:12.959 --> 09:15.493
It looks like she has kind of
a bohemian streak going on.

09:15.494 --> 09:16.795
Yeah.

09:16.796 --> 09:18.963
What were her favorite places to shop?

09:18.964 --> 09:20.464
High-end boutiques.

09:20.465 --> 09:21.865
Expensive ones?

09:21.866 --> 09:23.600
Certainly.

09:24.502 --> 09:25.502
And dressed to fit.

09:25.503 --> 09:26.503
She was tiny.

09:26.504 --> 09:27.871
Everything had to be taken in

09:27.872 --> 09:29.873
So she'd look...

09:29.874 --> 09:30.841
Her best.

09:30.842 --> 09:32.109
Would you mind writing down

09:32.110 --> 09:34.144
Some of her favorite places to go?

09:34.145 --> 09:37.547
So these are mostly
consignment and thrift shops?

09:37.548 --> 09:39.615
That's really all we could afford.

09:39.616 --> 09:42.385
Did she ever have these clothes altered?

09:42.386 --> 09:44.387
Uh, tailored to fit her better?

09:44.388 --> 09:45.988
I never really paid attention.

09:45.989 --> 09:50.693
Would she ever have worn
something like that?

09:50.694 --> 09:53.462
[crying]

09:53.463 --> 09:56.665
Would she ever wear anything like that?

09:56.666 --> 09:59.166
No.

10:03.138 --> 10:04.238
[carousel music playing]

10:04.239 --> 10:06.941
[indistinct chatter]

10:13.752 --> 10:16.155
Dave!

10:16.156 --> 10:17.524
Can you hear that?

10:17.525 --> 10:18.491
Yeah.

10:18.492 --> 10:19.892
She's posing her victims in a place

10:19.893 --> 10:22.028
That represents innocence and childhood.

10:22.029 --> 10:26.166
Most serial killers don't have
a particularly happy childhood.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.569
My guess is she wants them to have the fun

10:28.570 --> 10:30.338
She never got to have.

10:30.339 --> 10:32.173
Let's think about how she's
doing this practically.

10:32.174 --> 10:34.742
How's she getting them from
her car to the carousel?

10:34.743 --> 10:37.243
She's moving a body in
the middle of the night.

10:37.244 --> 10:40.546
She needs to make conditions
as favorable as possible.

10:40.547 --> 10:42.447
So she'd need a vehicle
that afforded her privacy--

10:42.448 --> 10:43.982
A van or an suv.

10:43.983 --> 10:47.385
That's still a lot of ground
to cover once she parks.

10:47.386 --> 10:48.753
Even if these women are light,

10:48.754 --> 10:50.955
She risks getting caught carrying a corpse.

10:50.956 --> 10:53.890
If she has a medical background,
what if she used a wheelchair,

10:53.891 --> 10:56.058
Something that would help
her move them quickly?

10:56.059 --> 10:57.826
And if she has a wheelchair,

10:57.827 --> 10:59.995
That means her van has a lift,

10:59.996 --> 11:02.664
Which would be helpful to unload a body.

11:02.665 --> 11:07.000
Which also means she has a handicap placard.

11:07.001 --> 11:10.203
Which would give her the
closest place to park.

11:10.204 --> 11:11.704
I'll have garcia pull all vehicles

11:11.705 --> 11:13.238
With handicap registrations.

11:13.239 --> 11:15.006
Thanks, dave.

11:15.007 --> 11:17.574
Once I have the knees bent,

11:17.575 --> 11:20.477
I can get leverage under her.

11:20.478 --> 11:22.812
Normally, an assistant helps me.

11:22.813 --> 11:25.414
But I can do it by myself if I need to.

11:25.415 --> 11:27.516
I'm assuming the unsub would
have this training, too.

11:27.517 --> 11:29.884
Let me ask you this-
is there anything specific about it?

11:29.885 --> 11:31.652
No, any caregiver out there can do this--

11:31.653 --> 11:33.854
Docs, nurses, orderlies.

11:33.855 --> 11:36.590
Where do you think she's getting
the drugs that she's using?

11:36.591 --> 11:38.058
Do you think she could be manipulating

11:38.059 --> 11:40.493
A doctor or a pharmacist, maybe?

11:40.494 --> 11:42.362
He'd be criminally negligent if she was.

11:42.363 --> 11:44.630
But it is possible.
I mean, doctors order things

11:44.631 --> 11:46.565
Through residents, nurses forge signatures,

11:46.566 --> 11:48.600
Prescriptions fall through cracks.

11:48.601 --> 11:51.036
That's a lot of drugs and a lot of cracks.

11:51.037 --> 11:53.705
She keeps these women
paralyzed for 2 months.

11:53.706 --> 11:54.906
Your report said both of them

11:54.907 --> 11:56.507
Had hair extensions clipped in.

11:56.508 --> 11:59.342
Yes, to hide the fact that clumps
of their real hair had fallen out.

11:59.343 --> 12:00.810
But if they were fed through I.V.S,

12:00.811 --> 12:02.412
That wasn't from malnutrition, right?

12:02.413 --> 12:05.181
You see this a lot in bedridden patients.

12:05.182 --> 12:08.384
Loss of motor function.
Especially in a young woman like this.

12:08.385 --> 12:09.585
Of course.

12:09.586 --> 12:10.686
Psychic shock.

12:10.687 --> 12:12.822
Yeah, the mental effects
take a physical toll.

12:12.823 --> 12:14.557
One last question-
in your professional opinion,

12:14.558 --> 12:18.060
Do you think the hair extensions were
clipped on before or after death?

12:18.061 --> 12:19.095
Before.

12:19.096 --> 12:20.930
And you seem pretty certain of that?

12:20.931 --> 12:23.732
You know the old wives' tale
about your hair and nails

12:23.733 --> 12:25.301
Growing after death.

12:25.302 --> 12:27.035
What's really happening is that dehydration

12:27.036 --> 12:29.171
Is shrinking your skin, pulling it back.

12:29.172 --> 12:31.407
Based on where she put these extensions,

12:31.408 --> 12:32.741
They were definitely still alive.

12:32.742 --> 12:35.644
Now, we know this unsub is
stuck in a rich fantasy, right?

12:35.645 --> 12:37.146
An incredibly detailed delusion.

12:37.147 --> 12:38.313
We don't know what the delusion is,

12:38.314 --> 12:40.215
But we know that it involves
remaking these women,

12:40.216 --> 12:42.284
And it begins the moment
she has them drugged.

12:42.285 --> 12:44.586
So she has them paralyzed and
she can do whatever she wants,

12:44.587 --> 12:45.721
Why is she killing them?

12:45.722 --> 12:47.022
Well, I don't think she means to.

12:47.023 --> 12:49.225
The brain is a machine
designed to respond to stimuli.

12:49.226 --> 12:51.260
If you keep the brain awake
but the body immobile,

12:51.261 --> 12:52.795
It breaks down, loses its hair.

12:52.796 --> 12:55.230
After 2 months, it eventually strokes out.

12:55.231 --> 12:56.999
So death isn't this unsub's goal,

12:57.000 --> 12:58.267
It's an unfortunate side effect.

12:58.268 --> 13:00.669
Exactly. What'd you find out?

13:00.670 --> 13:02.971
Both rita stuart and stacia
jackson were clothes hounds,

13:02.972 --> 13:05.507
But because they were petite women,
they had a lot of their stuff altered.

13:05.508 --> 13:07.743
Could be how our unsub
is finding her victims.

13:07.744 --> 13:09.344
She gets her hands on their measurements.

13:09.345 --> 13:11.980
But we already exhausted tailors,
alteration shops. There's no overlap.

13:11.981 --> 13:14.516
The tailors might send specialty
items out to third parties.

13:14.517 --> 13:16.251
Dig deep into extended employment records

13:16.252 --> 13:18.353
And see who they might be subcontracting to.

13:18.354 --> 13:19.754
Garcia needs to talk to us.

13:19.755 --> 13:21.222
Go ahead, garcia.

13:21.223 --> 13:23.558
Hello, my pretties. I have
finished my missing persons sweep.

13:23.559 --> 13:25.226
I've got nothing on the medical vehicle,

13:25.227 --> 13:29.064
But 2 new matches on the
clothes make the woman front.

13:29.065 --> 13:31.633
Cindy admundson. She was
abducted outside a thrift store,

13:31.634 --> 13:34.703
And maxine wynan was last
seen at the hillridge mall.

13:34.704 --> 13:36.004
That sounds like our girl.

13:36.005 --> 13:38.406
Any surveillance footage at the mall?

13:38.407 --> 13:40.575
No. It was an outside parking lot. So sorry.

13:40.576 --> 13:42.911
The new abductees-
what's their physical type?

13:42.912 --> 13:44.546
They look pretty tiny to me.

13:44.547 --> 13:46.547
I'm gonna send you pictures.
Also, if it pleases the court,

13:46.548 --> 13:48.716
I would like to direct your
attention to exhibit "a,"

13:48.717 --> 13:50.184
The calendar map.

13:50.185 --> 13:52.020
What about it?

13:52.021 --> 13:54.489
Both of these new victims
were abducted one week ago,

13:54.490 --> 13:57.826
Exactly one day before
the bodies of rita stuart

13:57.827 --> 14:00.295
And stacia jackson, respectively, turned up.

14:00.296 --> 14:03.531
She doesn't let a body go
until she has a replacement.

14:03.532 --> 14:04.665
[engine starts]

14:04.666 --> 14:06.066
Thank you so much.

14:07.668 --> 14:09.835
[car alarm chirps]

14:19.709 --> 14:21.643
Excuse me.

14:21.644 --> 14:22.777
Do you need some help?

14:22.778 --> 14:24.780
Oh, the ramp's broken.

14:24.781 --> 14:26.181
You want me to call a tow truck?

14:26.182 --> 14:27.883
I just need to get the chair in the van,

14:27.884 --> 14:29.384
And then I can go home.

14:29.385 --> 14:30.686
Well, we could load it.

14:30.687 --> 14:32.054
You think?

14:32.055 --> 14:33.422
Sure. We'll put it in the back?

14:33.423 --> 14:34.423
Go on in.

14:34.424 --> 14:35.424
You pull, I'll lift.

14:35.425 --> 14:37.026
Ok.

14:39.330 --> 14:40.997
1, 2...

14:40.998 --> 14:42.799
3.

14:44.468 --> 14:45.668
Here we go.

14:45.669 --> 14:48.437
Do we need to lock the
wheels or anything like that?

14:51.641 --> 14:53.542
Oh! Oh!

14:59.350 --> 15:01.485
[moaning]

15:01.486 --> 15:03.721
You're so pretty.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.327
Victim is mary newsome.

15:12.328 --> 15:15.297
Abducted 2 months ago.

15:15.298 --> 15:17.632
She was found on this bench
first thing this morning.

15:17.633 --> 15:19.633
Ok, well, it looks like her style.

15:19.634 --> 15:21.735
It's chiffon, and it's sewn to fit.

15:21.736 --> 15:25.036
If she's disposed of this body,
it means she's recently taken a new victim.

15:25.037 --> 15:27.438
We'll call hotch, we'll comb
through missing persons reports

15:27.439 --> 15:28.805
From the last 48 hours.

15:28.806 --> 15:30.139
I'll pulling them.

15:30.140 --> 15:31.941
Thank you. Mm-hmm.

15:31.942 --> 15:33.976
Hmm.

15:33.977 --> 15:36.011
What?

15:36.012 --> 15:37.913
These aren't hair extensions.

15:37.914 --> 15:39.681
Maybe her hair was too brittle.

15:39.682 --> 15:41.482
Maybe. I don't know.

15:41.483 --> 15:43.251
You know what? This is a wig.

15:43.252 --> 15:44.685
Kanekalon, I think.

15:44.686 --> 15:46.053
What's that?

15:46.054 --> 15:48.122
Uh, synthetic hair.
There's nothing special about it.

15:48.123 --> 15:50.524
It's used in wigs all over the world.

15:50.525 --> 15:52.258
But look at this.

15:54.594 --> 15:56.428
Ooh. Are those stitches?

15:56.429 --> 15:58.797
On her scalp.

15:58.798 --> 16:00.498
She sewed this in.

16:01.834 --> 16:04.001
[music playing]

17:10.855 --> 17:13.655
Yeah. Wallace. I got it. Thank you.

17:13.656 --> 17:16.656
Hey, I think we found who
was taken last night.

17:16.656 --> 17:18.056
Her name is bethany wallace.

17:18.057 --> 17:20.893
Her husband says she never
came home from the dry cleaners

17:20.894 --> 17:22.896
Where she stopped off
to pick up some clothes.

17:22.896 --> 17:24.864
Anybody at the cleaners see anything?

17:24.865 --> 17:26.398
The employees were busy locking up.
But they did mention

17:26.400 --> 17:28.300
That they do farm out work to
tailors who work from home.

17:28.301 --> 17:30.972
Good. We can match records based
on who worked on bethany's clothes.

17:30.973 --> 17:33.609
We just got the pictures of the
2 recent abductions from garcia.

17:33.610 --> 17:35.277
Line up the photos of the new victims

17:35.278 --> 17:38.213
Next to the bodies they replaced.
That might help us with the timeline.

17:50.890 --> 17:52.323
You guys see this?

17:52.324 --> 17:55.926
Yeah. She's matching up the
victims physically one to one.

17:55.927 --> 17:57.728
She's a collector.

17:57.729 --> 18:00.430
We're ready to give the profile.

18:00.431 --> 18:02.565
The unsub we're looking for is a woman.

18:02.566 --> 18:03.866
She's a collector.

18:03.867 --> 18:06.235
It's a psychopathology similar to hoarding.

18:06.236 --> 18:07.536
Rossi: So when we say collector,

18:07.537 --> 18:09.571
We're not talking about
stamps or baseball cards.

18:09.572 --> 18:12.540
It's not what your kids, or even you,

18:12.541 --> 18:14.209
Might pursue as a normal hobby.

18:14.210 --> 18:17.011
This is an attachment to objects
that's become obsessive,

18:17.012 --> 18:20.214
By someone who is antisocial
and extremely introverted.

18:20.215 --> 18:22.516
These people attach a part of themselves

18:22.517 --> 18:24.051
To their collection.

18:24.052 --> 18:26.252
If you try to separate them from it

18:26.253 --> 18:27.554
Or take it away from them,

18:27.555 --> 18:29.923
They will react violently,
even psychotically.

18:29.924 --> 18:31.824
They've suffered damage to
their prefrontal cortex.

18:31.825 --> 18:33.226
That's the part of the brain that regulates

18:33.227 --> 18:35.061
Basic freudian fantasy/reality.

18:35.062 --> 18:37.531
They can still function, like drive a car,

18:37.532 --> 18:39.402
Go to work, even do their taxes.

18:39.403 --> 18:41.872
In fact, she excels at goal-oriented jobs,

18:41.873 --> 18:44.375
Like the precision of sewing.

18:44.376 --> 18:45.910
Or the details of abduction.

18:45.911 --> 18:48.079
But they've lost their ability
to categorize the difference

18:48.080 --> 18:50.916
Between living and dead,
uh, belonging and loss.

18:50.917 --> 18:53.118
That has been irreparably destroyed.

18:53.119 --> 18:54.920
So, what's she collecting, women?

18:54.921 --> 18:56.088
Actually,

18:56.089 --> 18:58.389
We think she's collecting dolls.

18:58.390 --> 18:59.857
Technically, replacing them.

18:59.858 --> 19:01.559
We believe that she lost the originals

19:01.560 --> 19:03.528
Sometime within the last 3 months,

19:03.529 --> 19:06.430
And this is what served as her stress room.

19:06.431 --> 19:07.298
Rossi: She searched for a replacement,

19:07.299 --> 19:08.100
And when she couldn't find them,

19:08.601 --> 19:11.903
She started abducting the
closest possible surrogate.

19:11.904 --> 19:13.572
Women of different ethnicities

19:13.573 --> 19:15.174
But of similar physicality.

19:15.175 --> 19:17.844
The drug-induced parasis
is part of the fantasy.

19:17.845 --> 19:20.948
She puts her victims in a position
where they can't talk back

19:20.949 --> 19:23.584
So she can fetishize them
like the objects she's lost.

19:23.585 --> 19:26.187
Um...Look.

19:26.188 --> 19:27.554
I respect your analysis,

19:27.555 --> 19:29.219
But this woman kidnapped 6 women

19:29.220 --> 19:30.552
And killed 3 of them.

19:30.553 --> 19:33.215
And you're telling us this is about dolls?

19:33.216 --> 19:35.579
Prentiss: This unsub stitched a wig

19:35.580 --> 19:37.710
Onto the scalp of her latest victim.

19:37.711 --> 19:40.509
It's a technique used to
attach hair to porcelain dolls.

19:40.510 --> 19:42.742
And keep in mind,
collectors and serial killers

19:42.743 --> 19:44.675
Do share certain traits. Uh...

19:44.676 --> 19:46.376
A lot of serial killerstake tro,

19:46.377 --> 19:48.378
Attaching the same significance to them

19:48.379 --> 19:49.946
That this collector does to objects.

19:49.947 --> 19:52.048
Rossi: But this unsub's
intent isn't violence.

19:52.049 --> 19:54.483
She needs this collection to be complete

19:54.484 --> 19:56.551
So sheaneel in control of her life,

19:56.552 --> 20:00.054
Probably to overcome some
trauma she experienced.

20:00.055 --> 20:01.922
She really only feels that control

20:01.923 --> 20:03.524
When the collection is complete,

20:03.525 --> 20:06.059
Which is why she's repeating an
abduction pattern with living victims.

20:06.060 --> 20:07.327
If she loses a doll, or in this case,

20:07.328 --> 20:09.929
If she loses a woman who represents a doll,

20:09.930 --> 20:11.464
She has to replace it.

20:11.465 --> 20:12.965
Hotch: This woman works alone.

20:12.966 --> 20:14.900
We know she has medical training.

20:14.901 --> 20:16.402
Look for nurse's aides or orderlies

20:16.403 --> 20:19.672
Who we fired for a lack of social grace

20:19.673 --> 20:21.807
She can't fake a bedside manner.

20:21.808 --> 20:23.409
We believe she's currently working

20:23.410 --> 20:25.845
As a tailor or a seamstress,

20:25.846 --> 20:27.513
And we're following those leads now.

20:27.514 --> 20:28.681
But do let us know

20:28.682 --> 20:32.051
If you notice any overlap
in your suspect pools.

20:32.052 --> 20:33.085
Thank you.

20:33.086 --> 20:35.254
Of course I remember ms. Jackson.

20:35.255 --> 20:36.922
We were all sad to hear what happened.

20:36.923 --> 20:39.424
Do you ever farm out tailoring jobs,

20:39.425 --> 20:42.961
Someone who might have done this?

20:42.962 --> 20:45.230
No. [chuckles]

20:45.231 --> 20:46.431
To be perfectly honest,

20:46.432 --> 20:48.467
We wouldn't even sell something so dated.

20:48.468 --> 20:50.035
Let me take a look.

20:54.240 --> 20:56.508
Where did you get this?

20:56.509 --> 20:58.009
Why? Did you see something?

20:58.010 --> 20:59.678
Look at this lockstitch.

20:59.679 --> 21:01.546
It's a handkerchief pattern.

21:01.547 --> 21:04.883
You see this on silk-sewn handkerchiefs.

21:04.884 --> 21:07.719
And it's all done by hand.

21:07.720 --> 21:10.588
So this is her signature?
This is unique to her.

21:10.589 --> 21:12.991
I couldn't do it, not even with a machine.

21:12.992 --> 21:14.559
If there someplace that specializes

21:14.560 --> 21:16.261
In handcrafted sewing like this?

21:16.262 --> 21:17.395
No.

21:17.396 --> 21:18.796
I'll tell you this much, though.

21:18.797 --> 21:20.697
She's been at it a long time.

21:20.698 --> 21:21.865
This woman...

21:21.866 --> 21:24.034
Is an artist.

21:27.306 --> 21:30.141
Hotch, this is bethany wallace's sband karl.

21:30.142 --> 21:31.977
We brought him in for questioning.

21:31.978 --> 21:33.645
Do you know where my wife is?

21:33.646 --> 21:35.013
We're searching for her, sir.

21:35.014 --> 21:37.281
No. You have to find her
in the next 24 hours.

21:37.282 --> 21:38.283
Bethany is a diabetic.

21:38.284 --> 21:39.384
Look, agent prentiss said

21:39.385 --> 21:40.619
That the woman who took her

21:40.620 --> 21:41.920
Has medical training.

21:41.921 --> 21:44.791
So...Bethany could have a chance?

21:46.627 --> 21:47.761
What?

21:47.762 --> 21:49.964
She keeps her victims in a dru
g-induced state.

21:49.965 --> 21:51.599
They can't communicate.

21:53.536 --> 21:55.437
These...These drugs, will they--

21:55.438 --> 21:56.571
We don't know.

21:56.572 --> 21:58.774
But we're doing everything we can.

22:03.314 --> 22:05.482
[unsub humming]

22:35.374 --> 22:37.007
Everyone,

22:37.008 --> 22:38.275
This is sally.

22:38.276 --> 22:40.342
Be nice to her.

24:06.162 --> 24:08.796
So, doctor, if a diabetic were given

24:08.797 --> 24:11.031
This battery of drugs to keep her paralyzed,

24:11.032 --> 24:12.533
What would the reaction be?

24:12.534 --> 24:17.071
Diabetics metabolize everything
they consume differently--

24:17.072 --> 24:19.339
Food, drinks, drugs.

24:19.340 --> 24:21.241
It all gets broken down to blood sugar

24:21.242 --> 24:23.010
At varying rates.

24:23.011 --> 24:26.447
Most likely, this patient seized up

24:26.448 --> 24:28.382
Minutes after she was medicated.

24:28.383 --> 24:30.717
So she's already dead.

24:30.718 --> 24:32.786
Probably.

24:32.787 --> 24:34.821
Although...

24:34.822 --> 24:37.190
There is another possibility.

24:37.191 --> 24:40.360
Bethany's condition could
break down the drugs

24:40.361 --> 24:42.595
Faster than the other victims.

24:42.596 --> 24:44.330
She could regain control of her body?

24:44.331 --> 24:47.500
Every hour that she doesn't
turn up is a reason for hope.

24:47.501 --> 24:49.368
We're still running out of time.

24:49.369 --> 24:50.803
If the drugs don't kill bethany,

24:50.804 --> 24:53.038
She's not gonna last long without insulin.

24:54.607 --> 24:57.343
Man: Look, collectors are good,
honest people.

24:57.344 --> 25:00.313
Just because you enjoy dolls doesn't
make you a freak or a pedophile.

25:00.314 --> 25:01.680
Morgan: We appreciate that, sir,

25:01.681 --> 25:03.082
But the woman that we're looking for

25:03.083 --> 25:05.317
Has lost her ability to
control her obsession.

25:05.318 --> 25:07.519
She's killed 3 women trying
to recreate a type of doll

25:07.520 --> 25:08.853
She had as a child.

25:08.854 --> 25:10.221
Describe the line to me.

25:10.222 --> 25:11.522
Well, there's a pattern to the victims.

25:11.523 --> 25:13.358
They're in their 20s, and they're petite.

25:13.359 --> 25:17.163
Most doll lines revolve around infants.

25:17.164 --> 25:19.032
Is she dressing them like babies?

25:19.033 --> 25:20.267
No, she's not.

25:20.268 --> 25:22.172
Their wardrobe consists of chiffon dresses,

25:22.173 --> 25:24.675
Worn by one blond woman,
a redhead, and a black woman.

25:24.676 --> 25:27.610
The dresses--is she sewing them herself?

25:28.978 --> 25:30.812
How did you know that?

25:32.147 --> 25:34.248
It's the valois line.

25:34.249 --> 25:38.251
Local company, back in the late eighties.

25:38.252 --> 25:40.554
Probably when our unsub was prepubescent.

25:42.589 --> 25:43.789
Yeah.

25:43.790 --> 25:46.558
They promoted feminism and multiculturalism.

25:46.559 --> 25:48.961
Strong, independent girls
from different backgrounds

25:48.962 --> 25:50.662
Who could still be friends.

25:52.266 --> 25:54.901
Reid. Birth certificate to fill out.

25:54.902 --> 25:56.503
A form to describe their lives.

25:56.504 --> 25:58.171
And a kit to sew your own clothes.

25:58.172 --> 25:59.639
Jj said she's been at it for a while.

25:59.640 --> 26:02.074
She's probably been sewing
since she was a little kid.

26:02.075 --> 26:04.543
Wait a minute. Sir,
what's this contest that they held?

26:04.544 --> 26:07.812
That was to see who could come up
with the most imaginative doll.

26:07.813 --> 26:10.982
Sew a dress. Write an essay to describe her.

26:10.983 --> 26:13.785
If you won the contest, you'd have
your doll featured in next year's line.

26:13.786 --> 26:15.487
I assume that didn't end well, did it?

26:15.488 --> 26:17.489
No, it did not.

26:17.490 --> 26:19.992
It's a classic tool child psychologists use.

26:19.993 --> 26:21.695
Tell me a story with these dolls.

26:21.696 --> 26:24.870
When the company got essays
with thinly-veiled references

26:24.871 --> 26:26.306
To physical or sexual abuse,

26:26.307 --> 26:29.612
They turned the entry forms and
the dolls over to the police.

26:29.613 --> 26:31.013
The publicity killed the line.

26:31.014 --> 26:32.915
You said the company was local, right?

26:32.916 --> 26:35.818
They might still have
the clothes in evidence.

26:37.387 --> 26:41.856
[classical music playing]

27:21.029 --> 27:24.031
[unsub humming]

28:09.843 --> 28:11.978
How are the essays going?

28:11.979 --> 28:14.213
Makes for some pretty depressing reading.

28:14.214 --> 28:17.314
Prentiss is having a good time.

28:19.315 --> 28:20.482
Hey.

28:20.483 --> 28:22.484
These dolls are all like
little time capsules,

28:22.485 --> 28:25.653
Only the eighties fashion
wasn't so kind to them.

28:25.654 --> 28:27.154
I'm surprised how many little girls

28:27.155 --> 28:28.622
Knew how to make shoulder pads.

28:28.623 --> 28:29.990
Reid: How's it going on your end?

28:29.991 --> 28:32.926
I got a list of vendors
the victims went to--

28:32.927 --> 28:35.428
Tailors, seamstresses, that sort of thing.

28:35.429 --> 28:38.330
Hey, jj, you said something
about a handkerchief hem, right?

28:40.132 --> 28:43.567
That's exactly like what
she sews for her victims.

28:43.568 --> 28:45.669
What's the name on the entry?

28:45.670 --> 28:46.836
Samantha malcolm.

28:46.837 --> 28:48.204
She's on my list.

28:48.205 --> 28:51.841
Wait a minute, guys. I have her
essay around here somewhere.

28:51.842 --> 28:53.242
Right here.

28:53.243 --> 28:57.513
"sally doesn't like the
room with the lightning."

28:57.514 --> 28:58.814
That can't be good.

28:58.815 --> 29:00.982
Ok, guys, I just got samantha malcolm's

29:00.983 --> 29:02.551
Medical records, and...

29:02.552 --> 29:04.519
Oh, my god, she was doomed.

29:04.520 --> 29:06.288
Like emily bronte doomed,

29:06.289 --> 29:08.323
Like shakespeare doomed,

29:08.324 --> 29:10.158
Like red-shirted ensign
in "star trek" doomed.

29:10.159 --> 29:11.493
Garcia, what happened to her?

29:11.494 --> 29:13.427
Oh, uhsorry, uh,

29:13.428 --> 29:14.928
Well, for the first 10 years, nothing,

29:14.929 --> 29:18.966
And then she started a battery
of electroshock treatments.

29:18.967 --> 29:21.134
At 10? Who subjects a child to ect?

29:21.135 --> 29:23.303
That would be her father, dr.
Arthur malcolm.

29:23.304 --> 29:25.938
He runs an inpatient mental health facility

29:25.939 --> 29:28.774
For troubled young people called new lives.

29:28.775 --> 29:31.310
At first, the essay that
samantha wrote raised some flags,

29:31.311 --> 29:33.444
But her father explained that the therapy

29:33.445 --> 29:35.646
Was to deal with the
recent death of her mother.

29:35.647 --> 29:37.512
After that, he started her

29:37.513 --> 29:39.644
On a serious regimen of ant
i-psychotic drugs,

29:39.645 --> 29:41.179
Which he weaned her off of a few years ago.

29:41.180 --> 29:43.915
It explains her familiarity with medication.

29:43.916 --> 29:45.116
Where is she now?

29:45.117 --> 29:47.285
Uh, her father declared her incompetent,

29:47.286 --> 29:48.519
So he's still the legal guardian.

29:48.520 --> 29:49.787
Everything is in his name.

29:49.788 --> 29:52.457
And all of her records list
new lives as her residence.

29:52.458 --> 29:55.326
She couldn't keep victims
in an inpatient facility.

29:55.327 --> 29:56.394
She needs privacy.

29:56.395 --> 29:58.362
Garcia, what about real estate holdings

29:58.363 --> 29:59.897
In her father's name?

29:59.898 --> 30:02.600
Just his own. But new lives has

30:02.601 --> 30:05.237
A bunch of outpatient and
halfway houses all over town.

30:05.238 --> 30:06.471
Hotch: Jj, where does she work?

30:06.472 --> 30:08.672
I have her placed at 3
different shops around town.

30:08.673 --> 30:11.340
All right, let's split up and
cover the shops and the facility.

30:11.341 --> 30:12.708
I want to go to new lives.

30:12.709 --> 30:14.310
Whether or not she's there,
I want to talk to the father.

30:14.311 --> 30:16.846
There are literally hundreds of
therapies to help kids through loss.

30:16.847 --> 30:18.247
Electroshock is not one of them.

30:18.248 --> 30:20.850
Take rossi.

30:23.753 --> 30:26.021
Be nice to each other.

30:26.022 --> 30:28.090
See you later.

30:59.487 --> 31:01.122
We're leaving.

31:24.414 --> 31:27.015
Phone...

31:59.548 --> 32:01.048
[dial tone]

32:02.684 --> 32:05.453
No...No.

33:04.012 --> 33:06.047
I am very confused, gentlemen.

33:06.048 --> 33:07.681
What does this have to do with samantha?

33:07.682 --> 33:09.548
We need to talk to her. Is she here?

33:09.549 --> 33:10.549
No, she's at work.

33:10.550 --> 33:11.749
Does she live here,

33:11.750 --> 33:14.318
Or did you move her into
one of your halfway houses?

33:14.319 --> 33:16.353
As a matter of fact,
she is in one of my houses.

33:16.354 --> 33:18.255
Well, we'll need the address.

33:18.256 --> 33:19.756
And I'll need to know what this is about.

33:19.757 --> 33:22.992
She might be tied to a series of abductions.

33:22.993 --> 33:25.027
That's not possible. It's not my daughter.

33:25.028 --> 33:27.362
Is samantha on her own at this house?

33:27.363 --> 33:28.763
There are no other patients, right?

33:28.764 --> 33:31.365
She thought that was best, and I agreed.

33:31.366 --> 33:32.700
Yeah, but let's face it--

33:32.701 --> 33:34.601
You're happy that she's out of your hair.

33:34.602 --> 33:36.236
I beg your pardon?

33:36.237 --> 33:38.571
Because if you had been
visiting her recently, doctor,

33:38.572 --> 33:40.072
You would know what she's been doing.

33:40.073 --> 33:42.340
Samantha has always been troubled.

33:42.341 --> 33:43.941
3 women are dead because of her.

33:43.942 --> 33:44.942
She's not capable of that.

33:44.943 --> 33:46.043
Are you certain?

33:46.044 --> 33:47.477
I mean, the effects of electroshock,

33:47.478 --> 33:49.746
Especially at that age, are permanent.

33:49.747 --> 33:51.747
But maybe you knew that.

33:51.748 --> 33:54.016
My wife died when samantha was 10,

33:54.017 --> 33:55.683
And she never recovered.

33:55.684 --> 33:57.050
I tried everything.

33:57.051 --> 33:59.485
Child psychiatry, pet therapy,

33:59.486 --> 34:00.686
Nothing helped.

34:00.687 --> 34:01.921
She was cutting herself.

34:01.922 --> 34:03.555
She was in pain.

34:03.556 --> 34:05.490
That's the end of this meeting.

34:05.491 --> 34:07.324
Where's your daughter, doctor?

34:07.325 --> 34:09.292
And, agent rossi, if you try to talk to her,

34:09.293 --> 34:12.396
A mentally ill woman,
without her knowing what she's doing--

34:12.397 --> 34:13.797
Do you know about the women she's keeping?

34:13.797 --> 34:16.466
And have no medical or
legal counsel present,

34:16.467 --> 34:19.134
You'll have no case.
Do you understand me? None.

34:19.135 --> 34:20.335
We'll keep the police here

34:20.335 --> 34:22.770
In case samantha drops in for a visit.

34:22.771 --> 34:23.771
Let's go, reid.

34:23.772 --> 34:25.005
Hey, a really fast question.

34:25.007 --> 34:26.107
Why are these toys here?

34:26.108 --> 34:28.342
I use them in my therapy.

34:28.342 --> 34:30.511
No, I understand that,
but why are they way up on this shelf,

34:30.512 --> 34:32.580
Away from where any kids
can actually reach them?

34:32.581 --> 34:35.348
They're reminders of
patients that I've helped.

34:35.349 --> 34:37.016
Let me ask you something.

34:37.016 --> 34:41.853
What was the name of the girl
you helped with this one?

34:41.855 --> 34:43.487
Jenny larson.

34:43.489 --> 34:45.822
Hmm. And this one?
What was the name of the girl

34:45.824 --> 34:47.657
You helped with this one?

34:47.658 --> 34:49.692
Abigail moore.

34:49.693 --> 34:51.293
How about this one?

34:52.195 --> 34:53.896
Linda krauss.

34:53.897 --> 34:56.632
These girls are what, they're like 9-
-9 or 12 years old, I'm assuming?

34:56.632 --> 34:58.967
My ph.D. Is on the effect of trauma

34:58.968 --> 35:00.301
On prepubescent girls.

35:00.302 --> 35:02.003
I do not appreciate what you're implying.

35:02.004 --> 35:03.871
Oh, I'm not implying anything.

35:03.872 --> 35:05.072
I'm making an inference.

35:05.073 --> 35:07.474
An inference is an educated guess.

35:07.475 --> 35:09.809
And based on that, I form a hypothesis.

35:09.810 --> 35:11.477
For instance, my hypothesis here

35:11.478 --> 35:13.679
Is that after you raped your daughter,

35:13.680 --> 35:15.181
You submitted her to electroshock treatment

35:15.182 --> 35:16.315
To make sure she stayed quiet.

35:16.316 --> 35:17.450
This is outrageous.

35:17.451 --> 35:19.552
And then, out of guilt, you bought her toys,

35:19.553 --> 35:22.521
More specifically,
you bought her a line of dolls.

35:22.522 --> 35:25.558
Because that's what serial
molesters do. They give gifts.

35:25.559 --> 35:27.025
So you continued the pattern

35:27.026 --> 35:28.326
With your other patients,

35:28.327 --> 35:30.495
And once they left your care,
you added their toys

35:30.496 --> 35:32.130
To your collection.

35:32.131 --> 35:35.200
I'm sorry, you can't back
up your story, doctor.

35:35.201 --> 35:36.868
This is why I love my job, doctor.

35:36.869 --> 35:40.236
Because my lab, it's a jury of your peers.

35:40.237 --> 35:43.206
My tests will be jenny larson,
abigail moore,

35:43.207 --> 35:44.340
And linda krauss.

35:44.341 --> 35:45.775
The d.A. Will put them on the stand,

35:45.776 --> 35:47.610
And I'm going to personally
bring these dolls in,

35:47.611 --> 35:49.145
And we're going to watch how they react.

35:49.146 --> 35:53.448
Or you could tell us where your daughter is

35:53.449 --> 35:55.050
And we'll tell the d.A. You cooperated.

35:55.051 --> 35:57.719
But once we walk out this door,

35:57.720 --> 35:59.520
That deal comes off the table.

36:10.564 --> 36:13.831
2529 adams street.

36:15.865 --> 36:20.030
You'll tell them, right? That I cooperated.

36:20.031 --> 36:22.365
You want to knowow I figured you out?

36:22.366 --> 36:23.900
Those toys.

36:23.901 --> 36:25.534
You take care of them.

36:25.535 --> 36:27.102
These ones you treasured.

36:27.103 --> 36:30.438
But you know what?
The collection's not complete.

36:31.406 --> 36:33.507
Where are they?

36:44.083 --> 36:45.951
She's coming back.

37:11.209 --> 37:13.644
I have to put it back in.

37:13.645 --> 37:14.645
No, please.

37:14.646 --> 37:15.779
Please, don't.

37:15.780 --> 37:16.780
I'm sorry.

37:16.781 --> 37:18.315
Ohh...

37:18.316 --> 37:20.784
Oh...

38:26.650 --> 38:29.818
Don't leave me.

38:32.654 --> 38:34.789
Let us go.

38:35.825 --> 38:37.459
I can't.

38:37.460 --> 38:38.993
Samantha? [gasps]

38:38.994 --> 38:39.960
Hi.

38:39.961 --> 38:41.996
Uh, my name's spencer.

38:41.997 --> 38:43.966
I'm with the fbi.

38:43.967 --> 38:46.101
I know what your father did to you,

38:46.102 --> 38:47.302
And I want you to know

38:47.303 --> 38:50.906
That he can never, ever hurt you again.

38:52.241 --> 38:54.742
He never touched me. He's a good father.

38:54.743 --> 38:56.110
He loves me.

38:56.111 --> 38:59.981
I know that he probably forced
you to say those things,

38:59.982 --> 39:01.749
And he punished you if you got it wrong,

39:01.750 --> 39:04.552
Sent you to the room with the lightning.

39:05.620 --> 39:07.054
Yeah.

39:07.055 --> 39:10.090
The dolls that your father
gave you after he hurt you,

39:10.091 --> 39:11.524
What would happen to them?

39:11.525 --> 39:14.093
He kept them in his office
with the other toys.

39:14.094 --> 39:15.961
That's where he let you play with them?

39:15.962 --> 39:18.630
But when I moved out,
I had to take my friends with me.

39:18.631 --> 39:21.833
I couldn't leave them behind.

39:21.834 --> 39:24.134
Of course. And so you went you get them.

39:24.135 --> 39:26.604
What--what did you find?

39:31.776 --> 39:36.915
[samantha gasping]

39:36.916 --> 39:40.652
Aah!

39:40.653 --> 39:42.154
Yeah.

39:42.155 --> 39:44.451
He gave them to another girl, didn't he?

39:44.452 --> 39:45.718
Mm-hmm.

39:45.719 --> 39:48.020
Do you want them back?

39:48.021 --> 39:49.454
He said I couldn't.

39:49.455 --> 39:51.156
He said they were gone for good.

39:51.157 --> 39:53.558
He lied. He's been lying
to you for a long time.

39:53.559 --> 39:55.826
Do you want to see them?

39:55.827 --> 39:57.227
Can I?

39:57.228 --> 39:59.562
Yeah. Yeah, do you want to play with them?

39:59.563 --> 40:01.598
[sighs]

40:12.775 --> 40:15.914
Clear. We need medical here.

40:20.422 --> 40:22.456
Hold on. Hold on one second.

40:22.457 --> 40:23.490
Hey, samantha?

40:23.491 --> 40:26.259
Listen. You need to go with these men,

40:26.260 --> 40:29.095
But your friends can go with you, ok?

40:29.096 --> 40:32.097
They won't take-- they won't take them away?

40:32.098 --> 40:35.867
I promise no one will
ever take them away again.

41:07.800 --> 41:11.301
Well done, agent reid.

41:11.302 --> 41:13.236
Thanks.

41:52.972 --> 41:54.740
Checkmate in 12.

41:54.741 --> 41:56.675
No way.

41:56.676 --> 41:58.677
Let me show you.
