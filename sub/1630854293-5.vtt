WEBVTT

00:02.176 --> 00:04.743
Previously onSWAT...Truth be told, part of me

00:04.787 --> 00:06.267
still feels
like I've got big shoes to fill.

00:06.310 --> 00:07.659
HICKS: You do,
but the reason we chose you

00:07.703 --> 00:09.052
is because you're unique.

00:09.096 --> 00:10.749
It's up to us now working
together as a unit.

00:10.793 --> 00:12.012
HICKS:
I know Street covered
for you today,

00:12.055 --> 00:13.622
but you keep playing it fast

00:13.665 --> 00:16.146
and loose, and that winning
streak's gonna dry up like that.

00:16.190 --> 00:19.671
NICHELLE:
This pilot program was actually
founded by a police officer.

00:19.715 --> 00:21.412
It's really important that
civilians like yourselves

00:21.456 --> 00:23.153
and Nichelle are at
the forefront of this program.

00:23.197 --> 00:25.982
Would you be interested in
continuing to oversee COPE

00:26.026 --> 00:27.505
even if it were
a part of the LAPD?

00:27.549 --> 00:28.941
How could I? I'm a civilian.

00:28.985 --> 00:31.814
So am I.
What do you say?

00:32.641 --> 00:35.252
â™ª

00:36.123 --> 00:37.907
Hey, you're up early.

00:37.950 --> 00:39.430
Let me guess.

00:39.474 --> 00:41.780
The baby's doing karate all
up in your belly again, huh?

00:41.824 --> 00:43.565
No, she's been good.

00:43.608 --> 00:45.436
Mm.

00:45.480 --> 00:49.092
I was just looking over
the agenda for my OIG meeting.

00:49.136 --> 00:51.181
Oh, that's right,
today's your big first day.

00:51.225 --> 00:52.791
Mm-hmm.Ah, I bet the inspector
general's excited

00:52.835 --> 00:55.533
to have the brains of the
COPE Program on her panel.

00:55.577 --> 00:59.146
Keeping COPE on track is only
a tiny part of this job.

00:59.189 --> 01:01.409
Advising
on LAPD procedure changes,

01:01.452 --> 01:03.976
complaints against officers,
even reviewing

01:04.019 --> 01:05.543
other community initiatives.

01:05.587 --> 01:07.284
There's a lot
that's gonna be new for me.

01:07.328 --> 01:09.460
You'll get the hang of it.Ah.

01:09.504 --> 01:11.636
I hope so.
Trying to be super-prepared

01:11.680 --> 01:13.638
for today's topics.

01:13.682 --> 01:15.118
Oh, wow.

01:15.162 --> 01:16.989
LAPD Good Neighbor program
up for review.

01:17.033 --> 01:18.904
More like on the chopping block.

01:18.948 --> 01:20.993
I was doing some reading.

01:21.037 --> 01:22.299
I don't know that
much about it yet.

01:22.343 --> 01:23.908
Well, it gives police
discounts on homes

01:23.953 --> 01:25.520
in low-income areas.
The idea is

01:25.563 --> 01:27.913
to turn cops and community
into neighbors. You know, Luca

01:27.957 --> 01:30.176
bought his house through that
program, you should talk to him.

01:30.220 --> 01:32.179
Oh, that would
save me a ton of time.

01:32.222 --> 01:35.138
And it'd be good to hear from
someone who's actually done it.

01:35.182 --> 01:38.140
You okay if I stop by today
and ask him a few questions?

01:38.185 --> 01:40.752
You know you are always welcome.

01:40.795 --> 01:42.624
Hey.

01:42.667 --> 01:44.626
Stop stressing.

01:44.669 --> 01:46.758
You're gonna be great.

01:46.801 --> 01:48.064
I love you.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.413
I love you, too.

01:49.457 --> 01:50.588
[chuckles softly]

01:53.939 --> 01:56.507
REPORTER: Witnesses say it felt
like a coordinated attack...

01:56.551 --> 01:58.727
Press is calling 'em
"flash mob robberies."

01:58.770 --> 02:01.947
Bunch of shoplifters hit
a store at the same time,

02:01.991 --> 02:03.340
then scatter.It's clever.

02:03.384 --> 02:05.168
On-site security gets
overwhelmed.

02:05.212 --> 02:06.691
By the time patrol shows up,
the thieves are in the wind

02:06.735 --> 02:08.954
with thousands of dollars
worth of merchandise.

02:08.997 --> 02:10.347
This is the second incident
in a week.

02:10.390 --> 02:12.175
First was a hardware
superstore in the Valley.

02:12.219 --> 02:14.351
No this electronics store
on the west side.

02:14.395 --> 02:16.048
Those are really
different targets.

02:16.091 --> 02:17.702
What do we know about the crew?There isn't one.

02:17.746 --> 02:19.182
Events are organized online.

02:19.226 --> 02:20.531
Suspects don't even know
each other

02:20.575 --> 02:22.054
when they converge
on their target.

02:22.098 --> 02:24.231
RHD has been coordinating
with Cybercrime.

02:24.274 --> 02:26.276
Now they found
some social media accounts

02:26.320 --> 02:28.278
that hype the idea
to their subscribers.

02:28.322 --> 02:29.888
And then they drop
the details of the event

02:29.932 --> 02:31.107
right before it's happening.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.804
So the followers can
decide if they want

02:32.848 --> 02:34.154
to jump in
on the action.

02:34.197 --> 02:35.285
As if the Internet
doesn't enable

02:35.329 --> 02:36.895
enough bad behavioralready.

02:36.939 --> 02:38.418
Well, the word is, there's
gonna be another flash mob

02:38.462 --> 02:40.203
robbery today.
Yeah, but,
Commander, these

02:40.247 --> 02:42.204
are memes and TikToks, created
by teenagers and opportunists.

02:42.249 --> 02:44.207
Is this what SWAT's
on high alert for?

02:44.251 --> 02:45.426
Well, these thieves are not
major threats

02:45.469 --> 02:47.123
individually,
but as a collective,

02:47.167 --> 02:48.211
they're doing
real damage.

02:48.255 --> 02:49.473
I mean,
businesses are all over

02:49.517 --> 02:50.909
the mayor,
she's all over the chief.

02:50.953 --> 02:52.215
Patrol's stretched thin.

02:52.259 --> 02:53.651
They're asking
for our help.

02:53.695 --> 02:55.436
LAPD needs to shut one
down as it's happening.

02:55.478 --> 02:57.438
So I want 20-David dressed out
and standing ready.

02:57.481 --> 02:59.744
Once Cybercrime gets wind
of the next target,

02:59.788 --> 03:01.398
I want SWAT rolling.

03:01.442 --> 03:03.487
[sirens wailing]

03:07.970 --> 03:11.365
[clamoring, shouting]

03:11.408 --> 03:12.844
LAPD!

03:12.888 --> 03:13.845
Don't move!Drop it!

03:13.889 --> 03:15.412
You're done.

03:15.456 --> 03:16.805
Scoop 'em up.

03:16.848 --> 03:19.111
Guess Cybercrime was right
about a store here being

03:19.155 --> 03:20.329
the next flash mob target.

03:20.374 --> 03:21.766
We're here
to crash the party.

03:21.810 --> 03:22.811
Patrol's set a perimeter.

03:22.853 --> 03:24.204
Let's get inside.

03:26.466 --> 03:28.599
[clamoring, shouting continues]

03:30.253 --> 03:31.646
Shoplifters gone wild.

03:31.689 --> 03:33.387
All right, that's
our entry point right there.

03:33.430 --> 03:35.519
We work to the back. Deacon,
Luca, you take the south side.

03:35.563 --> 03:37.260
Street, Powell,
you take the north.

03:37.304 --> 03:38.609
Tan and I will clear things
up out here. Now remember,

03:38.653 --> 03:40.437
most of these people
are non-violent threats.

03:40.481 --> 03:42.352
Let's do it, go.

03:43.484 --> 03:45.180
LAPD. Who wants to go to jail?

03:45.225 --> 03:46.704
Put it down.

03:46.748 --> 03:48.140
Hey, hey!Put it down!

03:48.184 --> 03:49.272
Turn around.

03:49.316 --> 03:50.795
Give me your hands.

03:50.839 --> 03:52.579
Put it down.[scoffs] Make me.

03:53.972 --> 03:55.887
OFFICER:
Let's go.

03:55.930 --> 03:57.498
TEEN:
I'm coming.

03:59.195 --> 04:00.849
STREEET: You got him?Yes, sir.

04:00.892 --> 04:02.416
Thanks.

04:02.459 --> 04:04.331
Open the cash register!
You know you can do it.

04:04.374 --> 04:06.289
CLERK: I-I can't!
I don't have keys.ROBBER: Do it!

04:06.333 --> 04:08.465
I got two suspects
with crowbars.

04:08.509 --> 04:10.902
LAPD! Drop the crowbar.Cops!

04:10.946 --> 04:12.817
[grunting]

04:12.861 --> 04:14.210
Powell, with me.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.779
Got a shortcut.Powell!

04:22.305 --> 04:24.220
Don't shoot!
I work here. Please!

04:30.357 --> 04:32.402
Suspect's down.

04:32.446 --> 04:34.317
You can't just take off
like that.

04:34.361 --> 04:36.188
You don't know what could've
been behind that door.

04:36.232 --> 04:38.234
Relax.
We got the guy, didn't we?

04:38.278 --> 04:41.498
TAN: 25-David. We're circling
around to the stockroom access.

04:41.542 --> 04:42.586
[gunshot]

04:42.630 --> 04:44.675
26-David.

04:44.719 --> 04:45.720
We've got gunfire.

04:45.763 --> 04:47.112
30-David, responding.

04:48.157 --> 04:50.332
LAPD. Drop the gun![gunshots]

04:50.377 --> 04:55.164
LUCA: Whoa, check fire,
Deac, to your right!

04:55.207 --> 04:56.426
DEACON:
Moving.

04:56.470 --> 04:59.168
Hondo, armed male suspect
heading your way.

04:59.211 --> 05:01.388
Wounded, left arm.

05:09.744 --> 05:11.311
Suspect down.

05:12.181 --> 05:13.922
LUCA:
Clear.

05:13.965 --> 05:15.576
Got a body down.

05:18.013 --> 05:19.231
She's gone.

05:19.275 --> 05:20.885
Deacon, that's
the direction we fired from.

05:20.929 --> 05:22.931
Do you think it's possible...?

05:22.974 --> 05:25.412
It might've been my shot.

05:28.763 --> 05:30.721
Cover!

05:30.765 --> 05:32.114
He's got a kid.

05:33.158 --> 05:34.595
Back off!

05:34.638 --> 05:37.380
This is LAPD. We got
the place surrounded.

05:37.424 --> 05:38.903
You let that kid go.

05:38.947 --> 05:39.991
If you're really a cop,

05:40.034 --> 05:41.341
then we're on the same side.

05:41.384 --> 05:42.733
This is Sergeant Harrelson,
LAPD SWAT.

05:42.777 --> 05:45.432
You put that gun down,
nobody gets hurt.

05:46.781 --> 05:48.870
Okay.

05:48.913 --> 05:50.262
I'm putting my gun down.

05:50.306 --> 05:51.786
HONDO:Slowly.

05:54.963 --> 05:56.659
Tan, move in.

05:59.141 --> 06:00.621
Keep your hands up.

06:02.274 --> 06:03.232
Purdue?

06:03.275 --> 06:05.103
It's okay, Hunter.

06:05.147 --> 06:07.192
They're police.HONDO: Good.

06:07.236 --> 06:08.411
You know this guy?

06:08.455 --> 06:10.195
Yeah, he's my bodyguard.

06:19.857 --> 06:21.772
She was an employee.

06:21.816 --> 06:25.123
Only wrong choice she made
was coming into work today.

06:25.167 --> 06:26.821
How is that fair?

06:26.864 --> 06:29.911
We got 14 shoplifters
in custody.

06:29.954 --> 06:32.217
Injury count's
still climbing.

06:32.261 --> 06:34.394
Don't think there'll be any more
flash mob robberies for a while.

06:34.437 --> 06:36.134
Talk to me about
the bodyguard.

06:36.178 --> 06:38.136
His name's
Roger Purdue.

06:38.180 --> 06:39.790
His protectee
is Hunter Wright.

06:39.834 --> 06:42.445
The kid's a VIP.
His father's Gregory Wright.

06:42.489 --> 06:44.447
Big-time real estate developer.Yeah.

06:44.491 --> 06:45.796
Purdue was part
of the gunfight?

06:45.840 --> 06:47.450
[fading]:
Claimed it was self-defense.

06:47.494 --> 06:49.017
According to Purdue,
the guy we took down

06:49.060 --> 06:50.627
is one of four
masked gunmen.

06:50.671 --> 06:53.064
Tan's pulling
the security tapes to confirm.

06:53.108 --> 06:55.284
Commander?

06:55.327 --> 06:57.460
May I have a word?

06:58.287 --> 07:00.245
Yeah.

07:01.029 --> 07:03.901
Um... I spoke to Hondo.

07:03.945 --> 07:05.773
This fatality...

07:05.816 --> 07:08.689
She might've been caught in
the crossfire.
Mm-hmm.

07:09.994 --> 07:12.083
There's a possibility...

07:12.127 --> 07:13.737
it's my fatality.

07:13.781 --> 07:15.217
Oh.

07:15.260 --> 07:16.784
All right.

07:16.827 --> 07:19.439
Well, you're benched until
the ballistic report comes back,

07:19.482 --> 07:20.744
effective immediately.
Give RHD

07:20.788 --> 07:22.224
your statement
and your weaponry.

07:22.267 --> 07:24.356
Yeah.

07:31.973 --> 07:33.931
HONDO:
Sir?

07:33.975 --> 07:35.672
An unarmed Black girl

07:35.716 --> 07:37.761
shot by a white cop.
If it's true...

07:37.805 --> 07:39.894
I don't need to tell you
how bad this could get.

07:39.937 --> 07:41.330
Let me worry about that.

07:41.373 --> 07:42.766
We don't have all the facts.

07:42.810 --> 07:44.855
Speculation is not
gonna help Deacon.

07:44.899 --> 07:46.335
Or that young woman.

07:46.378 --> 07:48.206
And once you guys pull the
security tapes, you can turn

07:48.250 --> 07:49.381
over the scene.

07:49.425 --> 07:51.514
No video.
Store's security cameras

07:51.558 --> 07:53.473
all lost power two minutes
before the looting started.

07:53.516 --> 07:56.519
That didn't happen at any of
the other flash mob robberies.

07:56.563 --> 07:58.739
TAN: Yeah, it gets stranger.
Witnesses saw four gunmen,

07:58.782 --> 08:00.915
confirmed they were
armed and aggressive.

08:00.958 --> 08:02.438
But none of them were
carrying any merchandise.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.700
True for the guy we saw, too.

08:03.744 --> 08:05.615
No shopping bag, just a gun.

08:05.659 --> 08:08.052
Why come to a flash mob robbery
and not steal anything?

08:08.096 --> 08:09.271
Maybe they weren't here
to steal.

08:09.314 --> 08:11.403
Now Hunter is
a high-value target.

08:11.447 --> 08:13.318
What if the gunmen are
after him?

08:13.362 --> 08:15.364
Hunter had an appointment with
a stylist. They could've known

08:15.407 --> 08:16.757
exactly what time
he was gonna be here.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.585
And used the flash mob
thing as a diversion?

08:18.628 --> 08:20.717
It wouldn't be hard to get
a rumor going on social media,

08:20.761 --> 08:23.241
whip up a crowd to help cover
your real crime.Figure

08:23.285 --> 08:24.982
they could grab up Hunter and
get away before the cops came.

08:25.026 --> 08:27.855
They just didn't realize
we were already here.

08:27.898 --> 08:29.639
Hey, Purdue?

08:31.728 --> 08:33.687
Has Hunter been the target
of any threats recently?

08:33.730 --> 08:35.253
Yes.

08:35.297 --> 08:37.299
His father doesn't play around
when it comes to business.

08:37.342 --> 08:39.344
Lots of angry letters
and phone calls.

08:39.388 --> 08:40.736
There was an incident
last week.

08:40.780 --> 08:42.347
Someone broke
into his dorm.

08:42.390 --> 08:43.957
A kidnapping attempt?Couldn't rule it out.

08:44.001 --> 08:46.438
Mr. Wright has no shortage
of motivated enemies.

08:46.482 --> 08:48.223
We're gonna need
those letters.

08:48.266 --> 08:49.877
All call recordings.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.835
I recommend you and Hunter
come back to SWAT headquarters.

08:51.879 --> 08:54.446
Is that necessary?Well, if these gunmen staged

08:54.490 --> 08:56.057
an event this bold
to get Hunter,

08:56.100 --> 08:57.972
they're going to strike
again, faster and harder.

08:58.015 --> 09:00.496
LAPD can't risk that.

09:09.157 --> 09:11.420
â™ª

09:45.889 --> 09:47.891
Hunter Wright's family is
secure. Mom's coming in now.

09:47.935 --> 09:49.937
And Dad accepted
our protective detail.

09:49.980 --> 09:51.460
Smart move.

09:51.503 --> 09:53.680
Some serious haters in these
threat letters, from

09:53.723 --> 09:55.638
environmental activists
to other developers.

09:55.682 --> 09:57.814
The gunmen could be
working for any of 'em.

09:57.858 --> 09:59.511
We're running some partial
prints and tracing some

09:59.555 --> 10:01.339
phone numbers, but
nothing in these messages

10:01.383 --> 10:03.646
points directly
to today's attack.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.909
Okay, I got an ID on the
gunman that Hondo brought down.

10:05.953 --> 10:07.215
Simon Cong.

10:07.258 --> 10:09.521
HICKS: Immigrated from
China on a student visa.

10:09.565 --> 10:12.220
Worked as a bouncer until
about six months ago.
Yeah.

10:12.263 --> 10:14.657
The bar owner he worked for
said Cong was kind of a loner.

10:14.701 --> 10:17.486
He didn't know much
about him.
China. Hang on.

10:17.529 --> 10:20.402
Gregory Wright broke ground
on a luxury hotel

10:20.445 --> 10:21.838
in Beijing last year.

10:21.882 --> 10:23.492
Was supposed to be
low-income housing,

10:23.535 --> 10:25.668
but Wright made
a big bid on the land.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.365
He upset a lot of locals.

10:27.409 --> 10:28.715
So kidnapping Hunter
could be some kind

10:28.758 --> 10:30.455
of protest or payback.

10:30.499 --> 10:33.197
Yeah, but we need
more concrete info.

10:33.241 --> 10:34.372
There's three other gunmen.

10:34.415 --> 10:35.765
We ID them,
we find them

10:35.809 --> 10:37.680
before they strike again.Okay, security cameras

10:37.724 --> 10:39.595
were down before they arrived
in the store.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.075
Yeah, but those weren't the only
cameras in the building.

10:41.118 --> 10:43.077
There were dozens of shoppers
with cell phones.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.687
RHD collected recorded videos

10:44.731 --> 10:46.689
along with people's
witness statements.

10:46.733 --> 10:49.039
And we have two dozen
shoplifters in custody.

10:49.083 --> 10:50.954
Their phones are
in an evidence locker.

10:50.998 --> 10:53.217
People are dumb enough to film
themselves committing a crime.

10:53.261 --> 10:54.697
Anything to boost the 'Gram.

10:54.741 --> 10:56.220
All right, get the phones,
pull the video,

10:56.264 --> 10:57.744
and find those IDs.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.532
Tan's working on more IDs
for the rest of the gunmen.

11:03.575 --> 11:05.534
Collecting footage
of the robbery now.Great.

11:05.577 --> 11:07.492
Oh, hey, uh, real quick?

11:07.536 --> 11:09.581
Speaking of the
robbery, uh...

11:09.625 --> 11:11.801
I kind of wanted to talk
to you about something.

11:11.845 --> 11:13.934
Powell ignored orders,
didn't she?

11:13.977 --> 11:15.849
Now it's not the first time
she's been dinged

11:15.892 --> 11:17.067
for being reckless.
Come to think of it,

11:17.111 --> 11:18.678
it's not the second time,
either.

11:18.721 --> 11:20.375
That's why I wanted to talk.

11:20.418 --> 11:23.160
I corrected her in the field,
but she didn't get the issue.

11:23.204 --> 11:24.771
But, see,
that is the issue.

11:24.814 --> 11:27.208
Mistakes happen, but she is
not learning from them, Street.

11:27.251 --> 11:29.645
Now my team needs
to be able to rely on her.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.255
But right now...I know, I know.

11:31.299 --> 11:33.693
So I was thinking maybe
you can talk to her.

11:33.736 --> 11:35.738
Drop some Hondo
wisdom. Look.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.435
Powell is stubborn,

11:37.479 --> 11:39.699
but I really do think that
she's worth investing in.

11:39.742 --> 11:41.744
All right, then you do it.

11:41.788 --> 11:44.007
I tried.You try again.

11:44.051 --> 11:45.661
You're not in the heat
of the moment right now.

11:45.705 --> 11:46.488
So you've got some time
to go dig into her.

11:46.531 --> 11:48.142
If we can figure out

11:48.185 --> 11:51.449
why Powell does what she does,
then maybe we can fix it.

11:51.493 --> 11:52.842
And I'm starting to think
you might be

11:52.886 --> 11:54.496
the only one
who can get her to open up.

11:54.539 --> 11:55.932
Okay.

11:55.976 --> 11:57.586
Hey, Hondo?

11:58.674 --> 12:00.937
Thanks.Don't thank me yet.

12:00.981 --> 12:03.113
If Powell doesn't make changes
and follow procedure,

12:03.157 --> 12:05.550
I will bounce her,
before somebody gets hurt.

12:11.861 --> 12:14.124
[breathing shakily]

12:18.738 --> 12:21.871
[high-pitched ringing]

12:26.789 --> 12:29.009
[door opens]

12:38.888 --> 12:41.151
Ballistics report came back

12:41.195 --> 12:43.501
from the bullet pulled from
the dead employee's wound.

12:43.545 --> 12:45.677
Okay.

12:45.721 --> 12:48.768
It didn't match any
of SWAT's rounds.

12:51.205 --> 12:52.902
Okay.

12:56.732 --> 12:59.039
Um, her name?

13:00.867 --> 13:03.173
Her name was LaToya Turner.

13:05.872 --> 13:08.352
She'd worked at Coleson's
for five years.

13:08.396 --> 13:10.833
Started as a... stylist,

13:10.877 --> 13:12.879
worked her way
up to a buyer.

13:12.922 --> 13:15.359
You're not responsible
for her death, Deacon.

13:15.403 --> 13:17.753
She was, no, she was just

13:17.797 --> 13:20.016
in the wrong place
at the wrong time.Yeah.

13:21.888 --> 13:24.020
Those are the ones that
eat at me the most.

13:24.064 --> 13:25.979
As they should.

13:26.022 --> 13:27.632
20-Squad's tracking the IDs

13:27.676 --> 13:29.547
of the other gunmen.

13:29.591 --> 13:31.898
Do you need
some time, or...

13:31.941 --> 13:34.204
you want me to clear you
back into the field?

13:42.169 --> 13:43.561
Clear me.

13:43.605 --> 13:45.389
All right.

13:45.433 --> 13:47.043
I want to get these guys.

13:47.087 --> 13:49.872
And give LaToya Turner
some justice.

13:49.915 --> 13:51.918
Good.

13:58.925 --> 14:01.405
DEACON: Any luck identifying
the other gunmen?

14:01.449 --> 14:03.277
No, but I need to show
you guys something.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.366
I think we got their
motives all wrong.

14:05.409 --> 14:06.976
I'm listening.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.891
All right, so the gunmen
stay masked the whole time.

14:08.935 --> 14:10.850
I was able to organize
all the videos

14:10.893 --> 14:12.460
into a rough
chronological order.

14:12.503 --> 14:15.202
There's Hunter Wright, but
the crew moves right past him.

14:15.245 --> 14:17.160
There's no way
they missed seeing him.

14:17.204 --> 14:19.249
So we were wrong.
They weren't after Hunter.These guys didn't engage

14:19.293 --> 14:21.208
with Hunter's
security intentionally.

14:21.251 --> 14:23.253
So if the gunmen
weren't there for the kid,

14:23.297 --> 14:24.864
what were they after?TAN: Don't know yet.

14:24.907 --> 14:26.343
Now as the robbery goes on,

14:26.387 --> 14:28.432
the store continues to
clear out, they disappear

14:28.476 --> 14:29.912
from view a couple times.

14:29.956 --> 14:31.914
But I think I see them
in the back of this clip.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.611
I was gonna blow it up...

14:33.655 --> 14:35.265
HONDO:
Right there.

14:35.309 --> 14:37.877
They grabbed someone and that
was definitely a gunshot.

14:39.790 --> 14:41.445
DEACON:
It's LaToya Turner.

14:41.489 --> 14:43.273
That's the woman who was killed.

14:43.317 --> 14:45.406
We assume she was hit
with a stray bullet,

14:45.449 --> 14:46.929
but she was the target.

14:46.973 --> 14:48.713
These guys could've
killed LaToya anywhere.

14:48.757 --> 14:50.237
Instead they engineered

14:50.280 --> 14:52.369
an entire flash mob robbery
to cover it up.

14:52.413 --> 14:54.415
Which means whatever the
connection is between LaToya

14:54.458 --> 14:56.330
and these gunmen, they
wanted it kept secret.

14:56.373 --> 14:59.115
Wait, I found video of
LaToya during the robbery.

14:59.159 --> 15:00.638
They found me.

15:00.682 --> 15:02.423
Just go!
Get out of the apartment now.

15:02.466 --> 15:04.555
The apartment.
She's talking to someone that

15:04.599 --> 15:06.601
isn't at the store, which means,
that there's someone else.

15:06.644 --> 15:08.603
There's another person that
these gunmen are after.

15:08.646 --> 15:09.952
Tan, trace the number
LaToya called.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.388
I'll let Commander Hicks
know that Hunter

15:11.432 --> 15:12.955
and his family can leave
protective custody.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.957
I'll look into
LaToya's background.

15:15.001 --> 15:17.133
See if I can find out why
someone wanted her dead.

15:17.177 --> 15:20.136
They found me. Just go!
Get out of the apartment!

15:23.792 --> 15:25.576
Hey, I got this.All right.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.274
How are you?
Hi!

15:27.317 --> 15:29.058
We got our hands full
with that flash mob robbery,

15:29.102 --> 15:30.668
but Hondo said you might
come by for me.

15:30.712 --> 15:32.148
I'll be quick.
Mm-hmm.

15:32.192 --> 15:34.281
I started working in the
inspector general's office.

15:34.324 --> 15:37.023
Yeah.And we're reviewing the
Good Neighbor program.

15:37.066 --> 15:38.981
Wanted to ask you
about your experience.

15:39.025 --> 15:40.852
You know what,
using it might be

15:40.896 --> 15:42.811
the best decision
I ever made as a cop.

15:42.854 --> 15:44.247
I mean,
I'm part of a block.

15:44.290 --> 15:46.902
Makes me think differently
about people, be more open.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.209
What are you guys doing
with the program?

15:49.252 --> 15:52.081
Actually, we're debating
ending it.

15:52.125 --> 15:53.778
Why?

15:53.822 --> 15:56.825
Look, after Street and I moved
in, our neighborhood got safer.

15:56.868 --> 15:58.566
People don't try
as much shady stuff,

15:58.609 --> 16:00.655
'cause they know we're
there looking out for them.

16:00.698 --> 16:01.873
If the officers stick around,
then, yes,

16:01.917 --> 16:03.266
the program is effective.

16:03.310 --> 16:05.877
Problem is,
there are a lot of cops

16:05.921 --> 16:07.792
who use the program
to get a cheap house,

16:07.836 --> 16:09.707
stay exactly
as long as they have to,

16:09.751 --> 16:11.405
and then sell
for a big profit.

16:11.448 --> 16:13.189
Yeah, sure, the contract only
makes you stay for two years,

16:13.233 --> 16:16.018
I bet that some cops move on...A lot of cops.

16:16.062 --> 16:18.281
I've been reviewing
the data all morning.

16:18.325 --> 16:19.891
But you know there are
officers out there like me,

16:19.935 --> 16:21.545
who believe in the
Good Neighbor program.

16:21.589 --> 16:23.156
I can put you in touch
with some of them.

16:23.199 --> 16:25.549
I-I'd be happy to hear
from other participants,

16:25.593 --> 16:28.117
but I don't know, Luca.
I can't deny the stats.

16:28.161 --> 16:30.337
Right now, the initiative is
a waste of resources.

16:30.380 --> 16:32.730
And I owe it
to the inspector general

16:32.774 --> 16:34.558
to make a fair recommendation.

16:34.602 --> 16:36.082
I guess.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.822
Just doesn't seem
like you ever let the numbers

16:37.866 --> 16:39.781
get in the way
of a good idea before.

16:40.651 --> 16:43.437
Okay, I got to go.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.877
[sighs]

16:55.971 --> 16:58.060
TAN:
Phone number LaToya Turner

16:58.104 --> 17:00.541
called right before she was
killed belongs to a burner

17:00.584 --> 17:02.238
activated three days ago,
but whoever has it

17:02.282 --> 17:03.761
switched the phone off,
so we can't ping it.

17:03.805 --> 17:05.067
I looked further
into LaToya.

17:05.111 --> 17:06.763
No criminal history,
no contact

17:06.808 --> 17:08.375
with anyone even
the tiniest bit shady.

17:08.417 --> 17:10.246
If she's spotless,
why target her?

17:10.290 --> 17:11.856
Drugs? Maybe gambling debts?DEACON: Well, if she's

17:11.900 --> 17:13.944
got a problem, it's not
showing up in her financials.

17:13.989 --> 17:16.773
But this is.
Three days ago,

17:16.818 --> 17:18.385
a charge to a prepaid
phone company.

17:18.428 --> 17:21.257
That burner you mentioned,
LaToya activated it herself.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.259
That's odd.
And she withdrew some cash, too.

17:23.303 --> 17:25.087
She broke from her
usual routine,

17:25.131 --> 17:27.089
and made two trips to the
grocery store this week.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.178
Plus she used
her work discount

17:29.222 --> 17:31.267
to purchase clothes.
And this emailed receipt

17:31.311 --> 17:32.921
says none of them
are in her size.

17:32.964 --> 17:35.271
Food, clothing, cash.
All basic needs.

17:35.315 --> 17:37.360
We heard her say,
"Get out of the apartment."

17:37.404 --> 17:39.449
What if LaToya is
sheltering someone?

17:39.493 --> 17:41.364
Patrol didn't find anything
unusual at her place.

17:41.408 --> 17:44.106
Well, when LAPD reached out
to notify LaToya's next of kin,

17:44.150 --> 17:46.108
they contacted
her sister, Nicole.

17:46.152 --> 17:47.762
She's a property manager

17:47.805 --> 17:49.416
at an apartment building
in Santa Monica.

17:49.459 --> 17:51.113
In that building,
there is one vacant unit.

17:51.157 --> 17:53.072
Even if LaToya was
stashing someone there,

17:53.115 --> 17:54.595
they're long gone.

17:54.638 --> 17:56.249
They might've left something
behind. I'll call the sister.

17:56.292 --> 17:58.207
If LaToya was borrowing
this unit,

17:58.251 --> 18:01.036
it's worth a shot.Okay.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.647
Empty unit number's 229.

18:03.691 --> 18:05.867
You know, if my sister asked
to borrow a whole apartment,

18:05.910 --> 18:07.869
I'd ask
some follow-up questions.

18:07.912 --> 18:09.392
Busted window.

18:09.436 --> 18:11.655
POWELL:
Looks like the door's
broken, too.

18:11.699 --> 18:14.005
Gunmen must've figured out
LaToya's shelter spot.

18:14.049 --> 18:16.399
DEACON:
Could still be inside.

18:16.443 --> 18:18.314
Stay sharp.

18:18.358 --> 18:20.838
TAN:
Hey! Hold up!

18:20.882 --> 18:22.275
We got a rabbit!DEACON: Go.

18:22.318 --> 18:24.146
30-David, we got a solo runner

18:24.190 --> 18:26.235
heading east
on Montana.

18:26.279 --> 18:28.019
Hold up!

18:28.063 --> 18:29.891
[panting, whimpering]

18:32.111 --> 18:34.287
Hey! LAPD! Stop running!

18:34.330 --> 18:35.810
Stop!

18:35.853 --> 18:37.333
LAPD.

18:37.377 --> 18:38.856
You're police?

18:38.900 --> 18:40.293
Real police?

18:40.336 --> 18:41.859
I thought you were the guards

18:41.903 --> 18:43.861
coming back to get me.The guards?

18:43.905 --> 18:45.515
From the factory.

18:45.559 --> 18:47.038
You're the person
LaToya sheltered.

18:47.082 --> 18:49.171
The one the gunmen
are looking for.

18:49.215 --> 18:51.391
We've got you. You're safe now.

18:51.434 --> 18:52.696
But my brother.

18:52.740 --> 18:54.176
We escaped the factory together.

18:54.220 --> 18:56.178
I was out of the apartment
when LaToya called.

18:56.222 --> 18:57.701
When I came back,

18:57.745 --> 19:00.530
I saw them dragging
my brother to a car.

19:00.574 --> 19:02.141
Please.

19:02.184 --> 19:04.143
You have to save him.

19:12.499 --> 19:14.153
The factory that you worked in,

19:14.196 --> 19:15.458
you say you made clothes?Yes.

19:15.502 --> 19:18.287
Sewing all day.
Sunup to sundown.

19:18.331 --> 19:20.811
No breaks allowed.
And then they'd say

19:20.855 --> 19:23.292
we messed up
and don't deserve full wages.

19:23.336 --> 19:24.946
Long hours, low pay.

19:24.989 --> 19:26.513
Sounds like a sweatshop.

19:26.556 --> 19:28.297
Hold on, let's go back.

19:28.341 --> 19:30.169
How did you end up there?

19:30.212 --> 19:31.996
A man said he'd help us
immigrate from China.

19:32.040 --> 19:35.826
Promised us work,
a better life.

19:35.870 --> 19:37.350
It was all lies.

19:37.393 --> 19:39.526
How many workers are there?Eight.

19:39.569 --> 19:41.789
We had to share
two old mattresses to sleep on.

19:41.832 --> 19:43.660
So you couldn't leave
at all?

19:43.704 --> 19:45.662
The guards watch us
every minute.

19:45.706 --> 19:48.187
One time, another girl
tried to get out.

19:48.230 --> 19:49.666
They caught her.

19:49.710 --> 19:52.016
Beat her up. She died.

19:52.060 --> 19:53.104
They killed her?

19:53.148 --> 19:54.758
I don't know.

19:54.802 --> 19:56.717
She was all bloody,
and they took her away

19:56.760 --> 19:59.023
and we never saw her again.

20:00.242 --> 20:02.026
That's what they're gonna do
to my brother.

20:02.070 --> 20:04.377
You have to save him.DEACON: Hey.

20:04.420 --> 20:06.640
We've got a squad heading to the
address you gave us right now.

20:06.683 --> 20:08.729
If your brother's at that
sweatshop, we'll find him.

20:08.772 --> 20:10.426
The gunmen
from this morning's robbery

20:10.470 --> 20:11.993
could be the sweatshop's guards.

20:12.036 --> 20:14.213
Yeah, but they came to the store
specifically for LaToya.

20:14.256 --> 20:16.606
Did LaToya Turner help you

20:16.650 --> 20:18.260
and your brother escape?

20:18.304 --> 20:20.523
Yes. LaToya is an angel.

20:20.567 --> 20:22.525
She found the factory
when she was picking

20:22.569 --> 20:24.571
new clothes for her store.

20:24.614 --> 20:27.356
I begged her for help,
and she did.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.750
Is that how you found me?Grace?

20:30.751 --> 20:32.579
I'm sorry to tell you this.

20:32.622 --> 20:35.712
Um... LaToya was killed
this morning.

20:37.932 --> 20:40.195
She was in danger
because we escaped.

20:42.850 --> 20:45.722
And now my brother is, too.

20:49.160 --> 20:50.553
Right now,
we got nothing.

20:50.597 --> 20:52.251
Hey, we got a problem.

20:52.294 --> 20:54.818
That factory that Grace pointed
us to? There's no workers,

20:54.862 --> 20:56.298
no equipment,
not even product.

20:56.342 --> 20:58.082
When Grace and Park
disappeared, the guards

20:58.126 --> 21:00.346
must've got spooked,
moved the entire operation.

21:00.389 --> 21:01.825
We have to find them.

21:01.869 --> 21:03.740
Grace said that there are
seven other workers

21:03.784 --> 21:04.828
out there,
including her brother.

21:04.872 --> 21:06.265
Deacon,
the guards are in the wind,

21:06.308 --> 21:07.701
and we don't know if Grace's
brother is even alive.

21:07.744 --> 21:09.311
LaToya Turner was
murdered trying

21:09.355 --> 21:10.704
to help these people.

21:10.747 --> 21:12.749
So I'm sorry, but if
there's a tiny chance

21:12.793 --> 21:15.709
that we can help save them,
we got to take it.

21:16.666 --> 21:18.451
All right, what about
that building they vacated?

21:18.494 --> 21:20.409
Must've been a name
on the lease.Shell corporation.

21:20.453 --> 21:22.716
That warehouse was their only
property. It's a dead end.

21:22.759 --> 21:24.761
All right, whoever's
in charge of this sweatshop

21:24.805 --> 21:27.111
obviously covered
their tracks.

21:27.155 --> 21:28.722
Grace was inside.

21:28.765 --> 21:30.941
So maybe she saw something
or heard something...

21:30.985 --> 21:32.769
Right now, she's
our only lead.

21:36.556 --> 21:38.340
Did you save Park?

21:38.384 --> 21:40.081
Can I see him?DEACON: I'm sorry.

21:40.124 --> 21:42.736
We sent a team to the sweatshop,
but no one was there.

21:43.650 --> 21:45.913
It's my fault.

21:47.741 --> 21:49.830
I should have protected him.

21:49.873 --> 21:52.441
Hey, we are still looking
for your brother.

21:52.485 --> 21:54.443
We just need
to find another way.

21:54.487 --> 21:56.358
[sighs]
Grace...

21:56.402 --> 21:58.926
I need you to think
about the guards.

21:58.969 --> 22:02.843
Was there a leader or a boss?

22:03.800 --> 22:05.585
I didn't like looking
at him too long.

22:05.628 --> 22:07.456
He was scary.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.328
Yelled at us.

22:09.371 --> 22:11.025
Did you ever hear him talking
to the other guards?

22:11.068 --> 22:12.983
Maybe they mentioned his name?

22:13.027 --> 22:14.507
No.

22:14.550 --> 22:16.117
He only ever talk about work.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.641
How many pieces
we make in a day.

22:18.685 --> 22:20.208
How we need to do more. Uh...

22:20.251 --> 22:21.818
money and clothes, that's
all he ever talk about.

22:21.862 --> 22:22.863
Wait, the clothes.

22:22.906 --> 22:25.387
If we can ID the clothing

22:25.431 --> 22:27.258
the sweatshop was making,

22:27.302 --> 22:28.608
we can go talk to the brand.

22:28.651 --> 22:30.610
They'd know who was
running the factory.

22:30.653 --> 22:31.959
Did you ever sew a tag?

22:32.002 --> 22:33.787
Or-or maybe see a logo?

22:33.830 --> 22:36.311
I didn't attach the tags.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.444
Uh, sometimes there was

22:38.487 --> 22:40.446
a little T
on the shirts,

22:40.489 --> 22:42.491
but it didn't look
that special.

22:42.535 --> 22:43.884
It's something.

22:43.927 --> 22:45.842
And I know a guy
who might be able to help us.

22:45.886 --> 22:48.279
All right, well,
let's run with it and find out.

22:48.323 --> 22:49.368
TAN:
Grace?

22:49.411 --> 22:51.195
Can you draw
the logo for me?

22:51.239 --> 22:53.633
And anything else you remember
about the clothes?

22:57.463 --> 22:59.987
Hey.Hey.

23:01.118 --> 23:03.730
Tan took Luca to meet some
old C.I. from his Vice days.

23:03.773 --> 23:06.210
They think this guy
can ID the brand

23:06.254 --> 23:08.822
that's using the sweatshop.Cool.

23:08.865 --> 23:11.302
We need to talk through
what happened this morning.

23:12.478 --> 23:14.393
Not this again.

23:15.263 --> 23:18.266
You went through a door alone,
not knowing

23:18.309 --> 23:20.094
what was on the other side.Sure I did.

23:20.137 --> 23:22.183
It was a stockroom, a shortcut.

23:22.226 --> 23:24.533
[sighs]
There could've been suspects

23:24.577 --> 23:27.275
hiding in there,
waiting to ambush you.

23:27.318 --> 23:29.712
They weren't going to ambush me.
They were suburban moms

23:29.756 --> 23:31.888
grabbing free perfume.

23:31.932 --> 23:33.542
You always think you know
better than procedure.

23:33.586 --> 23:35.370
But it says we stick together

23:35.414 --> 23:37.067
for a reason.

23:37.111 --> 23:39.505
You probably pulled my records

23:39.548 --> 23:42.551
already,
but before I was LAPD,

23:42.595 --> 23:44.161
I worked
in the sheriff's department.

23:44.205 --> 23:46.425
No, I-I never
read your file.

23:46.468 --> 23:48.078
Well, I worked
search and rescue.

23:48.122 --> 23:51.386
My partner, Gabe,
had been on the job 20 years.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.649
Real... dad energy.

23:53.693 --> 23:55.782
Loved the outdoors.

23:55.825 --> 23:57.958
And the rules.

23:58.001 --> 23:59.916
What happened?Got called out

23:59.960 --> 24:01.918
to an injured climber
stuck on a cliff face.

24:01.962 --> 24:04.530
Gabe went up,
rocks were sliding around.

24:04.573 --> 24:06.749
[stammers]
And I had a weird feeling.

24:06.793 --> 24:08.882
So I told him to forget
about attaching

24:08.925 --> 24:10.927
the extra lines,
get the guy down now.

24:10.971 --> 24:13.452
But Gabe followed
every procedure to the letter,

24:13.495 --> 24:16.803
so he was still up there when
the whole cliff face gave way.

24:16.846 --> 24:18.892
Climber died.
Gabe might as well have.

24:18.935 --> 24:20.981
Spinal cord injury.

24:21.024 --> 24:23.287
Lives in a hospital now.

24:23.331 --> 24:26.116
I'm sorry. That-that
must've been really hard.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.075
If he would've listened to me,
they would've been safe.

24:28.118 --> 24:31.600
It was the protocol,
made up in some boardroom

24:31.644 --> 24:33.123
to cover liability
or whatever.

24:33.167 --> 24:34.951
I'll never let nonsense
like that get

24:34.995 --> 24:36.692
in the way of me
doing actual good again.

24:36.736 --> 24:38.607
Powell, just hold
on a sec-- hey!

24:38.651 --> 24:40.870
Hey, just wait a second.

24:42.437 --> 24:46.267
Look, what happened to Gabe,
that was not your fault.

24:46.310 --> 24:48.095
But you keep
this attitude up,

24:48.138 --> 24:50.793
you will hurt someone
or worse.

24:50.837 --> 24:52.752
Look, you've been
lucky so far.

24:52.795 --> 24:55.145
But I don't want me
or anyone on 20-Squad

24:55.189 --> 24:57.104
around when that
luck runs out.

25:11.335 --> 25:13.642
Nichelle.Theo.

25:13.686 --> 25:15.862
Thank you for meeting me
before tonight.

25:15.905 --> 25:17.864
I just wanted to
run some thoughts

25:17.907 --> 25:19.822
past another O.I.G. auditor.

25:19.866 --> 25:21.868
What did you want to talk about?

25:21.911 --> 25:23.957
The Good Neighborprogram.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.046
I've been talking to some
officers who've used it,

25:26.089 --> 25:29.353
and they are passionate
about how well it works.

25:29.397 --> 25:30.833
I'm sure they are.

25:30.877 --> 25:32.487
And they're not alone.

25:32.531 --> 25:33.793
I know what the stats are,

25:33.836 --> 25:36.447
but I think
we should consider

25:36.491 --> 25:39.015
recommending
the program continue,

25:39.059 --> 25:41.844
maybe with some more
provisions.

25:41.888 --> 25:45.021
Look,
I told the inspector general

25:45.065 --> 25:47.284
that bringing you in was
a mistake, but even I thought

25:47.328 --> 25:49.678
you'd wait for a bit
to start roadblocking us.

25:49.722 --> 25:51.201
Excuse me?

25:51.245 --> 25:53.377
You're a cop's girlfriend.The inspector general

25:53.421 --> 25:55.554
knew that
when she offered me the job.

25:55.597 --> 25:57.556
Sure, she's fine with it.

25:57.599 --> 25:59.601
Doesn't mean the rest of us are.

25:59.645 --> 26:01.690
I mean,

26:01.734 --> 26:03.083
you live with this guy, right?

26:03.126 --> 26:04.519
You talk shop with him?

26:04.563 --> 26:06.521
Uh, Hondo doesn't dictate
my opinions.

26:06.565 --> 26:07.827
Still,

26:07.870 --> 26:09.306
it makes me wonder
what you're doing

26:09.350 --> 26:11.178
in the inspector general's
office.

26:11.221 --> 26:13.659
You're basically a spy
for the cops.

26:13.702 --> 26:15.399
Not at all. I can be objective.

26:15.443 --> 26:17.401
We're standing
in SWAT's headquarters

26:17.445 --> 26:19.012
at your request.

26:19.055 --> 26:23.103
Theo, I asked you here
because it's closer

26:23.146 --> 26:25.322
to your office
than my South L.A.

26:25.366 --> 26:26.976
community center.

26:27.020 --> 26:29.239
But you're telling me you want
to rubber-stamp an LAPD program?

26:29.283 --> 26:30.893
Well, not because
it's a cop thing.

26:30.937 --> 26:32.634
Because I think
there's more to the story

26:32.678 --> 26:34.070
than what the numbers say.

26:34.114 --> 26:35.724
Did you decide that before

26:35.768 --> 26:39.162
or after talking to the officers
who are so passionate about it?

26:39.206 --> 26:40.990
And be honest,
were any of these guys

26:41.034 --> 26:43.210
your boyfriend's buddies?

26:45.952 --> 26:49.782
Like I said,
bringing you in was a bad idea.

26:52.785 --> 26:54.961
[door opens]

26:57.180 --> 26:59.661
A Fashion District connection
named Snazzy B?

26:59.705 --> 27:01.271
It's almost too perfect, bro.

27:01.315 --> 27:03.273
Know him from
my Vice days.

27:03.317 --> 27:04.753
The merch might
all be counterfeit,

27:04.797 --> 27:06.102
but the style's
all cutting edge.

27:06.146 --> 27:07.626
Let's just hope
he can ID the brand

27:07.669 --> 27:08.931
that was using the sweatshop.

27:08.975 --> 27:10.019
Officer Tan.Hey.

27:10.063 --> 27:11.281
Black on black?

27:11.325 --> 27:12.805
How boring.

27:12.848 --> 27:14.763
Yeah, function over style, man.
This is Officer Luca.

27:14.807 --> 27:16.069
What up? What up, man?What's up?

27:16.112 --> 27:18.027
Yeah, I need you
to take a look at this

27:18.071 --> 27:19.333
and tell me
if you recognize the logo

27:19.376 --> 27:20.856
or any
of these clothing designs.

27:20.900 --> 27:23.163
Hmm. How about
while I look this over,

27:23.206 --> 27:26.862
you fellas look these over?

27:26.906 --> 27:28.342
[laughs]LUCA:Yeah.

27:28.385 --> 27:29.865
No, thanks, man.
I'm gonna spend my money,

27:29.909 --> 27:31.127
it's gonna be on something real.

27:31.171 --> 27:33.042
They really tell time

27:33.086 --> 27:35.915
and shade your eyes.
It's the consumer

27:35.958 --> 27:38.134
who decides how much
a brand name is worth.

27:38.178 --> 27:40.049
It's worth something to you, you
took the trouble to spoof it.

27:40.093 --> 27:41.921
TAN:
He's got you there, man.

27:43.836 --> 27:45.141
Huh.

27:45.185 --> 27:47.143
This logo, this letter T,
plus the,

27:47.187 --> 27:49.363
uh, drapey tops... [chuckles]

27:49.406 --> 27:51.147
I think this is

27:51.191 --> 27:52.322
Tremblay's latest line.

27:52.366 --> 27:53.976
Tremblay? That's a designer?

27:54.020 --> 27:55.804
Vivian Tremblay would
call herself a designer,

27:55.848 --> 27:57.153
but I say
she's just another person

27:57.197 --> 27:59.547
shoving '70s style
in my face again.

27:59.590 --> 28:00.853
Bell-bottoms died

28:00.896 --> 28:02.637
for a reason.Yeah, noted.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.726
All right,
I'll call Hondo.

28:04.770 --> 28:06.989
Thanks for the info.

28:07.033 --> 28:08.861
Hey, be good now.
Don't hurt nobody.

28:08.904 --> 28:11.602
Yo, we got 'em.

28:13.561 --> 28:14.823
Hi.

28:14.867 --> 28:16.956
Welcome to Tremblay.
Can I help you?

28:16.999 --> 28:19.175
LAPD. We're looking
for Vivian Tremblay.

28:19.219 --> 28:21.090
Just want
to ask her a few questions.Oh.

28:21.134 --> 28:23.136
She's in the back.
I can get her for you.

28:23.179 --> 28:25.399
Oh, that's okay.
We'll find her.

28:29.490 --> 28:31.622
DEACON:
Vivian Tremblay?Cops are here.

28:32.798 --> 28:35.061
Excuse me.

28:35.104 --> 28:38.455
STREET:Stop!

28:38.499 --> 28:40.109
Don't move!

28:40.153 --> 28:42.677
Up against the wall.
She dropped it in the toilet.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.026
[panting]

28:44.070 --> 28:45.941
Who was that?

28:45.985 --> 28:47.638
Was that the sweatshop operator?

28:47.682 --> 28:51.338
Where are the workers, Vivian?
Where are they?!

28:55.821 --> 28:57.474
Phone company pulled the
last number that Vivian called.

28:57.518 --> 28:59.346
Belongs to a burner.
It's switched off.

28:59.389 --> 29:00.782
It's got to be
the sweatshop operator.

29:00.826 --> 29:02.784
She warned him, probably
told him to move the workers

29:02.828 --> 29:04.743
out of L.A.Which means
we got to find this guy

29:04.786 --> 29:06.527
before he gets them out
of the city.

29:06.570 --> 29:08.094
Tan and Powell are going through
Tremblay's business records

29:08.137 --> 29:10.096
from the showroom office,
looking for anything

29:10.139 --> 29:11.532
that can give us an ID.

29:11.575 --> 29:13.055
Well, it seems
like Vivian was involved

29:13.099 --> 29:14.491
in the sweatshop in a real way.

29:14.535 --> 29:16.102
But I doubt she has his name
in her records.

29:16.145 --> 29:17.407
Look, it's a long shot,
but we need some way

29:17.451 --> 29:18.495
to get to these workers.[phone vibrating]

29:18.539 --> 29:19.932
Hondo and Deacon
are talking

29:19.975 --> 29:22.717
to Vivian now.
We're working on it.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.588
I don't know what workers
you're talking about.

29:24.632 --> 29:26.025
DEACON:Okay.

29:26.068 --> 29:27.722
That phone call that
my colleague and I interrupted--

29:27.766 --> 29:29.071
what was that about?

29:29.115 --> 29:30.507
Something else.Vivian,

29:30.551 --> 29:33.032
we raided the sweatshop.We live in America.

29:33.075 --> 29:35.251
There haven't been sweatshops
here in decades.

29:35.295 --> 29:37.210
DEACON:
It's funny, because one
of your seamstresses--

29:37.253 --> 29:39.125
she told me that just yesterday,
she was in yours.

29:39.168 --> 29:40.648
Tremblay employs
no seamstresses.

29:40.691 --> 29:43.564
Piecework is sent
outside of the company,

29:43.607 --> 29:46.393
and I don't know anything
about the labor conditions.

29:46.436 --> 29:49.135
Come on. You were trying
to destroy your phone.

29:49.178 --> 29:51.050
That tells me
that you're trying to cover up

29:51.093 --> 29:52.486
how involved you really are.

29:52.529 --> 29:55.750
This goes better for you
if we save those workers.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.621
Now, if you help us,
maybe we can get some

29:57.665 --> 29:59.972
of the charges reduced, get a
few of them taken off the table.

30:00.015 --> 30:02.975
I... [sighs]

30:03.018 --> 30:04.541
I don't know
where they're being held.

30:04.585 --> 30:08.197
Then give us the name
of the sweatshop operators.

30:08.241 --> 30:10.460
Now, before you go turning
your nose up, know this.

30:10.504 --> 30:12.680
We are going
through your files,

30:12.723 --> 30:14.334
and we have his building.

30:14.377 --> 30:16.466
Now, it may take a minute,
but we are gonna find this guy.

30:16.510 --> 30:19.600
And when we do, I wonder if he's
gonna say that you don't know

30:19.643 --> 30:22.603
anything about what's going on
in your own clothing factory.

30:22.646 --> 30:24.431
Or maybe he just might
have some new insight

30:24.474 --> 30:27.129
into LaToya Turner's death.

30:27.913 --> 30:30.219
I will give you his name.

30:31.264 --> 30:34.658
But I want a deal
in writing first.

30:36.182 --> 30:38.619
She is 100% involved
in this thing.

30:38.662 --> 30:40.708
And we're offering
her a deal?

30:40.751 --> 30:42.884
There are other ways
to get this guy's name.

30:42.928 --> 30:44.538
But this is the fastest.

30:44.581 --> 30:47.280
We get the sweatshop operator's
ID, we can get to these workers

30:47.323 --> 30:49.586
before he can move 'em
out of the city.

30:49.630 --> 30:51.284
Deacon, he skips town
with them, they get tossed

30:51.327 --> 30:52.894
into some new bad situation.

30:52.938 --> 30:54.200
Maybe another sweatshop,

30:54.243 --> 30:55.549
maybe something even worse.

30:55.592 --> 30:57.246
What if we don't find this guy?

30:57.290 --> 30:59.858
Or what if the workers
are already dead?

31:00.859 --> 31:02.817
Then we've let her walk
for nothing,

31:02.861 --> 31:05.472
LaToya Turner has died
for nothing.HICKS: You were the one

31:05.515 --> 31:08.692
who said, if we had a chance
to save those workers,

31:08.736 --> 31:09.998
we have to take it.

31:10.042 --> 31:13.219
I know. I know.

31:14.916 --> 31:16.831
All right, call the D.A.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.267
Get the deal in writing,

31:18.311 --> 31:20.487
and get the sweatshop operator's
name from Vivian.

31:20.530 --> 31:22.271
Yes, sir.

31:22.315 --> 31:24.578
[Hicks sighs heavily]

31:29.713 --> 31:32.368
I got the name of the
sweatshop operator.

31:32.412 --> 31:35.850
William Chen.Look at this.
He makes frequent trips

31:35.894 --> 31:37.373
to China.

31:37.417 --> 31:39.027
He's probably the guy who
recruited Grace and her brother

31:39.071 --> 31:40.376
in the first place.

31:40.420 --> 31:41.943
Here are Chen's properties.

31:41.987 --> 31:43.640
Sweatshop lease was under
a shell company name,

31:43.684 --> 31:45.164
but Chen had
to move the workers

31:45.207 --> 31:46.643
out of that building
with no notice.

31:46.687 --> 31:48.558
He wouldn't have had time
to secure a new hidden spot.

31:48.602 --> 31:50.473
They're probably at a property
he already had available.

31:50.517 --> 31:53.215
His apartment? Risky to try
to bring in seven people

31:53.259 --> 31:55.826
without a neighbor
seeing something.Yeah.

31:55.870 --> 31:57.306
This here's a storage unit,

31:57.350 --> 31:59.178
but that company is big
on upgraded security.

31:59.221 --> 32:00.527
Cameras in every hallway,

32:00.570 --> 32:02.050
he'd have been caught
on tape for sure.

32:02.094 --> 32:03.399
Leaves this storefront.

32:03.443 --> 32:05.314
Paint shop, Chen's a co-owner.

32:05.358 --> 32:06.794
But it's a public place.

32:07.621 --> 32:09.101
But what about
the rear entrance?

32:09.144 --> 32:10.754
He sneaks them in
through the back.

32:10.798 --> 32:12.147
No one's the wiser.

32:12.191 --> 32:14.280
Chen only needs to stash
his workers for a few hours,

32:14.323 --> 32:15.672
while he makes arrangements
to get 'em out of town.

32:15.716 --> 32:17.239
Betting Vivian's call
sped up his plans.

32:17.283 --> 32:18.849
Let's roll.All right.

32:21.678 --> 32:24.638
30-David. We're set.

32:24.681 --> 32:26.945
STREET:
26-David in position.

32:26.988 --> 32:28.424
We got one suspect

32:28.468 --> 32:29.948
by a van.

32:29.991 --> 32:31.514
Plate's registered to Chen.

32:31.558 --> 32:32.820
Probably how he intends
to move them.

32:32.863 --> 32:34.082
DEACON:
According to Grace,

32:34.126 --> 32:35.779
there are seven other workers.

32:35.823 --> 32:37.259
Might be looking at three
or four armed guards,

32:37.303 --> 32:38.608
including Chen.

32:38.652 --> 32:40.175
STREET: All right,
I got a second suspect visible.

32:40.219 --> 32:41.698
He's loading three
workers into the van.

32:41.742 --> 32:43.004
Could be more inside already.

32:43.048 --> 32:44.614
I... I don't have a visual.

32:44.658 --> 32:47.008
Still can't see

32:47.052 --> 32:48.836
the other workers or Chen.

32:51.012 --> 32:52.840
Van's pulling out now.

32:52.883 --> 32:54.973
All right, let's go. Go!

32:55.016 --> 32:56.800
[siren wailing]

32:56.844 --> 32:58.106
22-David coming in.

33:00.500 --> 33:03.024
[siren whooping]

33:04.852 --> 33:06.985
[tires squealing]

33:10.597 --> 33:13.643
[siren wailing]

33:13.687 --> 33:15.080
[engine revs]

33:21.347 --> 33:22.565
Out of the van!

33:22.609 --> 33:25.046
Get out of the van!

33:25.090 --> 33:27.309
Get out now!
Show us your hands!

33:27.353 --> 33:30.312
Your hands up!
Don't even think about it!

33:31.313 --> 33:32.967
LAPD!

33:33.707 --> 33:36.405
Out! You two, out! Move!

33:36.449 --> 33:37.363
Move!

33:37.406 --> 33:39.017
Get on the ground!

33:40.540 --> 33:42.411
Going hands on!

33:42.455 --> 33:44.065
Give me your hands.

33:44.109 --> 33:46.111
Suspect one in custody!

33:46.154 --> 33:47.329
Get out.

33:47.373 --> 33:49.418
STREET: Suspect down.
Tan, you got him?

33:49.462 --> 33:51.029
TAN:
Yeah.

33:54.380 --> 33:57.035
Third suspect's approaching.
He's rabbiting!

34:02.997 --> 34:05.086
Two! Two! Give me two!

34:05.130 --> 34:07.045
With you. With you.
Go. Go.

34:11.962 --> 34:15.400
Drop the weapon!
Show us your hands!

34:21.407 --> 34:23.757
[groaning]

34:23.800 --> 34:25.411
[panting]

34:26.455 --> 34:28.849
Suspect three in custody.[zip-tie tightens]

34:28.891 --> 34:31.025
Nice job, Powell.

34:34.027 --> 34:37.684
It's okay.
We're police.

34:37.726 --> 34:39.773
Hey, there's six workers
in here.

34:40.817 --> 34:42.123
Come on.

34:42.167 --> 34:44.429
HONDO: Deac,
there should be one more worker.

34:59.662 --> 35:03.101
LAPD! Stop right there!
Don't move!

35:03.144 --> 35:06.887
20-Squad, I got eyes on the
seventh worker and William Chen.

35:11.196 --> 35:13.111
Park Lin, your sister Grace
showed us your photo.

35:13.154 --> 35:14.590
Grace? She's okay?

35:14.634 --> 35:16.766
We got her. She's safe.

35:16.810 --> 35:18.420
I shoot him!

35:18.464 --> 35:19.508
Come on now, Chen.

35:19.552 --> 35:21.597
Back up!Park needs medical attention.

35:21.641 --> 35:22.990
Let me leave!Can't do that.

35:23.033 --> 35:24.252
You're not gonna get away
from us, Chen.

35:24.296 --> 35:26.254
Let's make a deal.Like what?

35:26.298 --> 35:29.127
We know about the sweatshop
and LaToya Turner's murder.

35:29.170 --> 35:30.650
We got Vivian Tremblay
in custody.

35:30.693 --> 35:32.782
She's saying she had nothing
to do with any of it.

35:32.826 --> 35:34.828
She's a liar and a snake!

35:34.871 --> 35:37.483
Take it easy. Chen.
Relax, Chen.

35:37.526 --> 35:39.180
Let's talk about this.

35:40.834 --> 35:43.271
[gunshot]Go!

35:47.406 --> 35:49.147
On your stomach!

35:49.973 --> 35:51.453
20-David to Command.

35:51.497 --> 35:54.152
Fourth suspect in custody.
We're Code Four.

35:54.935 --> 35:57.155
[panting]It's over.

36:11.560 --> 36:13.519
Pardon me.

36:13.562 --> 36:15.390
Watch your step.

36:15.434 --> 36:17.523
I will, Officer.

36:17.566 --> 36:19.351
It's Sergeant.

36:19.394 --> 36:20.656
[Vivian scoffs]

36:20.700 --> 36:22.832
[scoffs]

36:22.876 --> 36:24.530
So Vivian Tremblay
walks free, huh?

36:24.573 --> 36:26.009
Well, not exactly.

36:26.053 --> 36:28.316
The D.A. wasn't willing
to grant her full immunity.

36:28.360 --> 36:30.579
I mean, she's still gotta answer
for destroying evidence

36:30.623 --> 36:32.364
and obstruction of justice.

36:32.407 --> 36:34.366
So she pays a fine that
she can afford ten times over,

36:34.409 --> 36:36.019
and then goes back
to doodling overpriced pants

36:36.063 --> 36:37.325
like nothing happened.

36:37.369 --> 36:39.066
Making a deal got us
those workers

36:39.109 --> 36:40.850
before Chen could
get 'em out of town.

36:40.894 --> 36:42.330
They're what mattered most.

36:42.374 --> 36:44.376
Now it wasn't
the perfect option,

36:44.419 --> 36:46.334
but it was the right one.That doesn't make it

36:46.378 --> 36:47.944
any easier, watching
her waltz out of here.

36:47.988 --> 36:50.120
I know, I know, but come on.

36:50.164 --> 36:52.601
Something else
I want you to see.

36:55.387 --> 36:57.389
â™ª

37:03.264 --> 37:06.789
Baby, you better get over to
the inspector general's office.

37:06.833 --> 37:09.270
Your meeting starts soon.Don't think I'm gonna make it.

37:09.314 --> 37:11.098
Letter of resignation.

37:11.141 --> 37:12.621
Gonna turn it in.

37:12.665 --> 37:14.406
Okay, hold up, hold up.

37:14.449 --> 37:16.538
Is this because of what
that Theo guy said to you?

37:16.582 --> 37:17.887
He is not

37:17.931 --> 37:19.759
the inspector general.
She believed in you.

37:19.802 --> 37:21.108
But Theo was right.

37:21.151 --> 37:22.414
I took a look at the numbers

37:22.457 --> 37:24.242
for the Good Neighbor program,
and then

37:24.285 --> 37:26.244
changed my mind
after I spoke to Luca.

37:26.287 --> 37:28.071
And if you quit,
what happens to COPE?

37:29.290 --> 37:31.858
There are other great advisors
in the IG's office.

37:31.901 --> 37:33.860
Hey, they are not you.

37:33.903 --> 37:35.557
Hondo, if

37:35.601 --> 37:36.906
I can't be objective,

37:36.950 --> 37:38.299
I'm not going to be able
to do the job.

37:38.343 --> 37:40.736
I disagree.
Nichelle, I am not impartial.

37:40.780 --> 37:42.869
I see a situation, and I think

37:42.912 --> 37:45.045
about it as a cop,
I think about it as a Black man,

37:45.088 --> 37:46.351
and a member
of the South L.A. community

37:46.394 --> 37:47.700
and a hundred other things.

37:47.743 --> 37:51.094
And my ultimate decision
is the better for it.

37:51.138 --> 37:54.010
That's true,
but I've seen the line you walk.

37:54.054 --> 37:57.623
I got a taste of it today--
the cop and the community side

37:57.666 --> 38:00.321
pulling me
in opposite directions.

38:00.365 --> 38:02.671
It's not easy, and I know
the toll it takes on you.

38:02.715 --> 38:06.284
You can do everything
I can backwards and in heels.

38:06.327 --> 38:08.938
Nichelle, trust yourself

38:08.982 --> 38:11.550
like I trust you.

38:12.551 --> 38:14.596
[sighs]

38:16.468 --> 38:19.209
That's Nicole Turner,
LaToya's sister.

38:19.253 --> 38:20.950
When I let her know
that we secured the people

38:20.994 --> 38:24.432
that LaToya was helping, Nicole
asked if she could meet them.

38:24.476 --> 38:28.175
Thank you for saving my brother
and the others.

38:28.218 --> 38:29.916
It's the least
we can do.

38:29.959 --> 38:32.527
I just wish...

38:34.007 --> 38:35.704
You are like me.

38:35.748 --> 38:39.882
Always thinking I could have
done a better job somehow.

38:39.926 --> 38:41.710
[chuckles softly]Grace,

38:41.754 --> 38:44.539
I made some calls. If you and
Park need a place to stay, I...

38:44.583 --> 38:48.064
Oh, no need.
Nicole offered us a place

38:48.108 --> 38:50.240
and help to find real jobs.

38:50.284 --> 38:52.330
She said
it's what LaToya would want.

38:52.373 --> 38:54.941
I don't doubt that one bit.

38:54.984 --> 38:56.508
Excuse me.

38:56.551 --> 38:59.859
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

38:59.902 --> 39:02.165
DEACON:
Nicole,

39:02.209 --> 39:05.125
I'm David.
I'm so sorry for your loss.

39:09.564 --> 39:11.349
Theo?

39:11.392 --> 39:14.395
I was hoping to catch you
before the meeting.

39:14.439 --> 39:16.832
Okay.You were right.

39:16.876 --> 39:20.009
The IG's office shouldn't
re-up the Good Neighbor program.

39:20.053 --> 39:23.143
But we shouldn't
cancel it, either.

39:23.186 --> 39:25.972
I don't understand.

39:26.015 --> 39:27.843
The reason I sided
with the officers

39:27.887 --> 39:31.194
who love this program isn't
because I'm knee-jerk pro-cop.

39:31.238 --> 39:33.458
It's because the program works.

39:33.501 --> 39:35.373
And the numbers back that up.

39:35.416 --> 39:38.071
But they also tell us
what the problem is.

39:38.114 --> 39:40.203
Cops who abuse
the initiative for profit.

39:40.247 --> 39:41.727
You want to reform it?

39:41.770 --> 39:44.643
I just dropped off
some proposed changes.

39:44.686 --> 39:46.514
Cops stay in their homes

39:46.558 --> 39:48.516
that they purchase
for five years minimum.

39:48.560 --> 39:50.518
And if they choose
to sell before then,

39:50.562 --> 39:52.607
the Good Neighbor program has
a right to buy back the house

39:52.651 --> 39:53.956
at a fair cost.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.523
The inspector general
was intrigued.

39:55.567 --> 39:57.090
I am, too.

39:57.917 --> 39:59.309
But...

39:59.353 --> 40:02.443
it should be eight years
minimum commitment.

40:02.487 --> 40:05.315
I'm open to discussion.

40:07.448 --> 40:09.842
I still don't trust you.

40:09.885 --> 40:11.583
You don't have to.

40:11.626 --> 40:12.932
Shall we?

40:12.975 --> 40:15.238
After you.

40:17.153 --> 40:18.503
Hi.

40:21.854 --> 40:24.204
Hey.Hey.

40:25.292 --> 40:27.468
Oh, uh, I spoke to Powell.

40:27.512 --> 40:30.210
It wasn't perfect, but...

40:30.253 --> 40:32.560
I think I got through to her.

40:32.604 --> 40:34.562
She followed procedure
at the paint shop.

40:34.606 --> 40:37.130
That's a start.Yeah.

40:39.001 --> 40:40.481
Oh, uh, by the way,

40:40.525 --> 40:42.657
you were right
about her opening up to me.

40:42.701 --> 40:44.006
And?

40:44.050 --> 40:47.357
Powell says she's got attitude

40:47.401 --> 40:49.403
because protocol is made up.

40:49.447 --> 40:52.101
If you ask me,
it's 'cause she couldn't

40:52.145 --> 40:54.103
save someone she cared about,
and she doesn't want

40:54.147 --> 40:56.236
to feel like that again, so,

40:56.279 --> 40:58.630
she's decided not
to trust anyone.

41:00.501 --> 41:02.024
Well, that's
an understandable response

41:02.068 --> 41:03.504
for a human being, Street.

41:03.548 --> 41:06.812
But it ain't ideal
for a SWAT teammate.

41:06.855 --> 41:08.422
[locker closes]

41:08.466 --> 41:10.032
There's hope.

41:10.076 --> 41:12.034
She heard me today.

41:12.078 --> 41:14.472
Key word is "today."

41:14.515 --> 41:16.561
I'm still worried
about tomorrow.

41:16.604 --> 41:18.824
What you're describing doesn't
sound like the kind of thing

41:18.867 --> 41:20.956
that goes away
from a single heart-to-heart.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.132
I guess I'm in it
for the long haul then.

41:23.176 --> 41:25.526
Look, she did listen to you
today, and you damn sure know

41:25.570 --> 41:27.397
what it takes
to be a good SWAT officer.

41:27.441 --> 41:30.009
I know I can do this, Hondo.

41:30.052 --> 41:32.098
I know it.All right.

41:32.141 --> 41:34.970
You get Powell squared away.

41:35.014 --> 41:36.885
She's your responsibility now.
