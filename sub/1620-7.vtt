"Summoned to court
to answer for the crimes

02:05.626 --> 02:09.755
"of your bannerman Gregor Clegane,
the Mountain." Er...

02:09.880 --> 02:14.510
"Arrive within the fortnight
or be branded an enemy of the crown."

02:15.969 --> 02:17.304
Poor Ned Stark.

02:17.429 --> 02:19.890
Brave man, terrible judgement.

02:24.770 --> 02:27.189
Attacking him was stupid.

02:35.322 --> 02:36.823
Lannisters...

02:37.824 --> 02:39.409
don't act like fools.

02:45.624 --> 02:47.459
Are you going to say something clever?

02:49.169 --> 02:51.380
Go on, say something clever.

02:54.550 --> 02:56.426
Catelyn Stark took my brother.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.016
- Why is he still alive?
- Tyrion?

03:03.809 --> 03:05.811
Ned Stark.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.646
One of our men interfered,

03:07.813 --> 03:11.024
speared him through the leg
before I could finish him.

03:11.984 --> 03:14.236
Why is he still alive?

03:15.404 --> 03:17.406
It wouldn't have been clean.

03:17.489 --> 03:18.949
Clean.

03:20.075 --> 03:24.329
You spend too much time worrying
about what other people think of you.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.456
I could care less
what anyone thinks of me.

03:26.582 --> 03:29.626
That's what you want
people to think of you.

03:29.710 --> 03:30.961
It's the truth.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.882
When you hear them whispering
"kingslayer" behind your back,

03:34.965 --> 03:36.967
doesn't it bother you?

03:39.136 --> 03:41.305
Of course it bothers me.

03:41.430 --> 03:43.307
A lion doesn't concern himself

03:43.432 --> 03:45.392
with the opinions of the sheep.

03:48.437 --> 03:50.564
I suppose I should be grateful
that your vanity

03:50.689 --> 03:52.733
got in the way
of your recklessness.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.988
I'm giving you half of our forces -

03:58.113 --> 03:59.489
30,000 men.

03:59.615 --> 04:03.327
You will bring them to Catelyn Stark's
girlhood home

04:03.410 --> 04:05.829
and remind her that Lannisters

04:05.954 --> 04:07.873
pay their debts.

04:07.998 --> 04:12.127
I didn't realise you placed such
a high value on my brother's life.

04:12.211 --> 04:14.671
He's a Lannister.

04:14.796 --> 04:18.132
He might be the lowest of the Lannisters,
but he's one of us.

04:18.257 --> 04:20.677
And every day that he remains a prisoner,

04:20.802 --> 04:23.680
the less our name commands respect.

04:23.805 --> 04:26.005
So the lion does concern himself
with the opinions of...

04:26.016 --> 04:28.352
No, that's not an opinion. It's a fact.

04:30.896 --> 04:33.357
If another house
can seize one of our own

04:33.440 --> 04:36.068
and hold him captive with impunity,

04:36.151 --> 04:38.445
we are no longer a house to be feared.

04:43.158 --> 04:45.035
Your mother's dead.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.287
Before long I'll be dead.

04:47.371 --> 04:49.206
And you...

04:49.331 --> 04:51.500
and your brother
and your sister

04:51.542 --> 04:53.126
and all of her children.

04:53.252 --> 04:57.506
All of us dead,
all of us rotting in the ground.

04:58.340 --> 05:01.051
It's the family name that lives on.

05:01.176 --> 05:03.554
It's all that lives on.

05:03.679 --> 05:06.723
Not your personal glory,
not your honour,

05:06.807 --> 05:08.684
but family.

05:09.601 --> 05:10.853
Do you understand?

05:14.106 --> 05:15.858
Hmm.

05:23.282 --> 05:26.743
You're blessed with abilities
that few men possess.

05:26.869 --> 05:31.039
You're blessed to belong to the most
powerful family in the Kingdoms.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.875
And you're still blessed with youth.

05:34.168 --> 05:37.462
And what have you done
with these blessings, huh?

05:37.546 --> 05:41.049
You've served as a glorified
bodyguard for two kings -

05:41.216 --> 05:44.636
one a madman,
the other a drunk.

05:49.892 --> 05:53.645
The future of our family will be determined
in these next few months.

05:53.729 --> 05:57.816
We could establish a dynasty
that will last a thousand years.

05:57.900 --> 06:01.320
Or we could collapse into nothing,
as the Targaryens did.

06:04.531 --> 06:08.035
I need you to become the man
you were always meant to be.

06:09.036 --> 06:12.331
Not next year. Not tomorrow.

06:12.414 --> 06:13.999
Now.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.988
You're in pain.

06:50.994 --> 06:53.038
I've had worse, my lady.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.416
Perhaps it's time to go home.

06:56.542 --> 06:58.335
The South doesn't seem
to agree with you.

06:58.502 --> 07:00.921
I know the truth Jon Arryn died for.

07:02.005 --> 07:03.924
Do you, Lord Stark?

07:04.758 --> 07:07.511
Is that why you called me here,
to pose me riddles?

07:08.846 --> 07:11.056
Has he done this before?

07:12.432 --> 07:17.563
Jaime would have killed him.
My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.

07:17.646 --> 07:19.273
Your brother...

07:19.356 --> 07:20.691
or your lover?

07:25.529 --> 07:28.115
The Targaryens wed brothers
and sisters for 300 years

07:28.198 --> 07:30.742
to keep bloodlines pure.

07:30.826 --> 07:32.911
Jaime and I are more
than brother and sister.

07:33.036 --> 07:35.163
We shared a womb.

07:35.247 --> 07:38.125
We came into this world together.
We belong together.

07:39.084 --> 07:41.128
My son saw you with him.

07:47.843 --> 07:49.094
Do you love your children?

07:49.219 --> 07:51.099
- With all my heart.
- No more than I love mine.

07:51.221 --> 07:54.349
- And they're all Jaime's.
- Thank the gods.

07:54.433 --> 07:58.113
In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores
for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed,

07:58.145 --> 07:59.938
I finish him off in other ways.

08:00.022 --> 08:02.774
- In the morning, he doesn't remember.
- You've always hated him.

08:02.900 --> 08:06.069
Hated him? I worshipped him.

08:06.153 --> 08:10.908
Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed
of him, but he was mine by oath.

08:11.033 --> 08:14.953
And when I finally saw him
on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor,

08:15.078 --> 08:16.788
lean and fierce and black-bearded,

08:16.914 --> 08:19.082
it was the happiest moment of my life.

08:20.876 --> 08:23.003
That night he crawled on top of me,
stinking of wine,

08:23.086 --> 08:25.964
and did what he did,
what little he could do,

08:27.966 --> 08:30.219
and whispered in my ear, "Lyanna".

08:32.386 --> 08:34.640
Your sister was a corpse
and I was a living girl

08:34.765 --> 08:36.767
and he loved her more than me.

08:39.311 --> 08:42.313
When the king returns from his hunt,
I'll tell him the truth.

08:42.438 --> 08:45.651
You must be gone by then -
you and your children.

08:45.776 --> 08:48.445
I will not have
their blood on my hands.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.989
Go as far away as you can,

08:51.114 --> 08:53.325
with as many men as you can.

08:53.450 --> 08:55.786
Because wherever you go,

08:55.911 --> 08:58.163
Robert's wrath will follow you.

08:58.288 --> 09:00.999
And what of my wrath, Lord Stark?

09:01.124 --> 09:03.377
You should have taken the realm for yourself.

09:03.502 --> 09:06.338
Jaime told me about the day
King's Landing fell.

09:06.463 --> 09:09.258
He was sitting in the Iron Throne
and you made him give it up.

09:09.341 --> 09:11.718
All you needed to do
was climb the steps yourself.

09:11.844 --> 09:14.471
Such a sad mistake.

09:14.596 --> 09:17.099
I've made many mistakes in my life...

09:18.308 --> 09:19.768
but that wasn't one of them.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.436
Oh, but it was.

09:22.563 --> 09:24.773
When you play the game of thrones,
you win...

09:24.857 --> 09:26.316
or you die.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.319
There is no middle ground.

09:36.076 --> 09:39.454
Come here.

09:55.846 --> 09:58.765
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

10:01.977 --> 10:03.061
Oh!

10:03.145 --> 10:07.065
Oh, yes! Oh! Oh!

10:07.774 --> 10:11.153
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Oh!

10:11.820 --> 10:14.823
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

10:15.032 --> 10:16.450
Oh!

10:16.575 --> 10:19.411
No, no, no, no!

10:21.288 --> 10:23.832
Is that what they teach you
up in the North?

10:25.209 --> 10:27.586
And you -
wherever you're from -

10:29.129 --> 10:31.632
do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

10:33.050 --> 10:36.136
Either of you understand
a thing that I'm saying?

10:37.221 --> 10:38.931
Yes, my lord.

10:39.056 --> 10:41.308
Let's start over, shall we?

10:42.643 --> 10:44.853
You be the man...

10:44.937 --> 10:46.939
and you be the woman.

10:51.401 --> 10:52.819
Well, go ahead.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.449
Slowly.

11:05.874 --> 11:08.919
You're not fooling them.
They just paid you.

11:09.127 --> 11:11.463
They know what you are.

11:11.505 --> 11:13.674
They know it's all just an act.

11:13.799 --> 11:16.552
Your job is to make them
forget what they know.

11:16.677 --> 11:18.762
Now, that takes time.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.557
You need to...

11:21.682 --> 11:23.600
ease into it.

11:26.103 --> 11:27.771
Go ahead.

11:28.522 --> 11:30.524
Ease into it.

11:39.783 --> 11:43.120
He's winning you over
in spite of yourself.

11:43.287 --> 11:45.038
You're starting to like this.

11:46.248 --> 11:48.041
He wants to believe you.

11:48.208 --> 11:52.087
He's enjoyed his cock since he was old
enough to play with it. Why shouldn't you?

11:52.254 --> 11:55.382
He knows he's better
than other men.

11:55.507 --> 11:58.927
He's always known it deep down inside.
Now he has proof.

11:59.595 --> 12:01.555
He's so good,

12:01.680 --> 12:06.393
he's reaching something deep inside of you
that no one even knew was there,

12:06.476 --> 12:09.104
overcoming your very nature.

12:11.315 --> 12:13.442
Why don't you join us, my lord?

12:14.818 --> 12:17.070
I'm saving myself for another.

12:17.863 --> 12:19.698
What she doesn't know won't hurt her.

12:19.781 --> 12:21.825
A stupid saying.

12:21.909 --> 12:24.953
What we don't know is usually
what gets us killed.

12:26.538 --> 12:28.457
She must be very beautiful.

12:28.540 --> 12:32.252
No, not really.
Impeccable bloodlines though.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.338
I do believe my lord's in love.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.841
For many years.
Most of my life, really.

12:37.883 --> 12:39.176
Play with her arse.

12:39.343 --> 12:41.428
And she loved me too.

12:41.970 --> 12:45.974
I was her little confidant, her plaything.

12:46.099 --> 12:49.061
She could tell me anything,
anything at all.

12:49.144 --> 12:53.023
She told me about all the horses
that she liked,

12:53.148 --> 12:55.442
the castle that she wanted to live in

12:55.526 --> 12:58.445
and the man that she wanted to marry -

12:58.529 --> 13:01.823
a Northerner...
with a jaw like an anvil.

13:01.907 --> 13:05.077
So I challenged him to a duel.

13:05.160 --> 13:07.996
I mean, why not?
I'd read all the stories.

13:08.038 --> 13:11.792
The little hero always beats
the big villain in all the stories.

13:11.917 --> 13:16.338
In the end,
she wouldn't even let him kill me.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.882
"He's just a boy," she said.

13:18.966 --> 13:20.926
"Please don't hurt him."

13:22.052 --> 13:25.764
So he gave me a nice little scar
to remember him by, and off they went.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.599
Is she still married to him?

13:27.683 --> 13:30.644
Oh, no. He got himself killed
before the wedding...

13:32.771 --> 13:36.525
...and she ended up with his brother,
an even more impressive specimen.

13:36.650 --> 13:39.236
She loves him, I'm afraid.

13:39.319 --> 13:42.906
And why wouldn't she?
I mean, who could compare to him?

13:43.031 --> 13:45.242
He's just so...

13:51.415 --> 13:52.749
...good.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.754
Do you know what I learned,
losing that duel?

13:58.839 --> 14:02.092
I learned that I'll never win, not that way.

14:02.217 --> 14:04.094
That's their game,

14:04.178 --> 14:06.763
their rules.

14:06.889 --> 14:08.849
I'm not going to fight them.

14:08.974 --> 14:12.144
I'm going to fuck them.
That's what I know.

14:12.269 --> 14:14.396
That's what I am.

14:14.479 --> 14:17.357
And only by admitting what we are
can we get what we want.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.777
And what do you want?

14:20.861 --> 14:23.447
Oh, everything, my dear.

14:24.489 --> 14:26.408
Everything there is.

14:29.620 --> 14:32.414
Now wash yourselves.
Both of you are working tonight.

14:39.004 --> 14:40.464
Hmm.

15:03.487 --> 15:05.948
You're a very lucky girl.
Do you know that?

15:09.368 --> 15:12.746
Where I come from,
we don't show mercy to criminals.

15:12.871 --> 15:16.542
Where I come from,
if someone like you attacked a little lord...

15:16.667 --> 15:19.920
at low tide we'd lay you
on your back on the beach,

15:20.045 --> 15:22.923
your hands and feet
chained to four stakes.

15:23.048 --> 15:25.551
The sea would come in
closer and closer.

15:25.634 --> 15:29.263
You'd see death creeping towards you
a few inches at a time.

15:31.640 --> 15:33.392
Where is it you come from?

15:33.475 --> 15:35.602
The Iron Islands.

15:35.686 --> 15:36.770
They far away?

15:36.854 --> 15:39.273
You've never heard of the Iron Islands?

15:39.356 --> 15:43.026
Trust me, you've never heard
where I'm from neither.

15:43.986 --> 15:46.488
"Trust me, my lord."

15:49.324 --> 15:51.618
You're not living in the wilderness anymore.

15:51.702 --> 15:53.996
In civilised lands,
you refer to your betters

15:54.079 --> 15:56.206
by their proper titles.

15:56.290 --> 15:58.959
- And what's that?
- Lord.

15:59.543 --> 16:00.919
Why?

16:02.004 --> 16:03.672
Why?

16:03.797 --> 16:05.716
What do you mean, why?

16:05.799 --> 16:09.052
My father is Balon Greyjoy,
Lord of the Iron Islands.

16:09.178 --> 16:10.762
What's that got to do with you?

16:12.181 --> 16:13.724
If your father's lord,

16:13.849 --> 16:15.726
how can you be lord too?

16:15.809 --> 16:20.314
- I will be lord after my father.
- So you're not lord now?

16:20.397 --> 16:22.274
No, you...

16:23.650 --> 16:27.154
Are you having a go at me?
Is that it?

16:27.279 --> 16:30.073
I just don't understand
how you southerners do things.

16:30.157 --> 16:33.452
- I'm not a southerner.
- You're from south of the Wall.

16:34.453 --> 16:36.622
That makes you a southerner to me.

16:38.874 --> 16:41.585
You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?

16:42.669 --> 16:44.463
Couldn't say, my lord.

16:44.588 --> 16:46.507
Don't know what "impunent" means.

16:46.590 --> 16:48.509
Impudent.

16:48.634 --> 16:51.970
It means rude, disrespectful.

16:56.141 --> 16:58.268
Do you want to lose that chain?

17:00.395 --> 17:02.648
Theon Greyjoy!

17:02.731 --> 17:05.192
The lady is our guest.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.194
I thought she was our prisoner.

17:07.277 --> 17:10.948
Are the two mutually exclusive
in your experience?

17:21.375 --> 17:24.377
Chances are I won't be nearby
the next time that happens.

17:24.502 --> 17:26.255
I'm used to worse than him.

17:26.338 --> 17:27.381
Hmm?

17:27.506 --> 17:30.217
I'm used to men who could
chew that boy up

17:30.342 --> 17:32.761
and pick their teeth with his bones.

17:38.851 --> 17:40.352
Why did you come here?

17:40.435 --> 17:42.437
Didn't mean to come here.

17:43.438 --> 17:45.440
Meant to get much further south than this.

17:45.482 --> 17:48.443
As far south as south goes,

17:48.485 --> 17:50.654
before the long night comes.

17:51.572 --> 17:54.575
Why? What are you afraid of?

17:54.700 --> 17:58.745
There's things that sleep in the day
and hunt at night.

17:59.872 --> 18:03.458
- Owls and shadowcats...
- I'm not talking about owls and shadowcats.

18:07.713 --> 18:10.048
The things you speak of -

18:11.008 --> 18:13.677
they've been gone
for thousands of years.

18:13.802 --> 18:15.637
They wasn't gone, old man.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.515
They was sleeping.

18:19.975 --> 18:22.144
And they ain't sleeping no more.

18:31.403 --> 18:33.780
I miss girls.

18:33.864 --> 18:36.617
Not even talking to them.
I never talked to them.

18:38.619 --> 18:40.204
Just looking at them,

18:40.370 --> 18:41.872
hearing them giggle.

18:47.753 --> 18:49.588
Don't you miss girls?

18:54.760 --> 18:55.844
Riders.

18:56.803 --> 18:59.306
The horn.
We have to blow the horn.

19:00.641 --> 19:02.601
Why is he alone?

19:04.561 --> 19:06.980
One blast for a ranger returning,

19:07.064 --> 19:08.857
two for wildlings,

19:08.982 --> 19:11.109
- three for...
- There's no rider.

19:43.559 --> 19:45.352
Whoa, boy, whoa.

19:45.561 --> 19:47.563
That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.

19:55.612 --> 19:57.698
Where's my uncle?

20:00.617 --> 20:02.411
Ned!

20:04.246 --> 20:07.207
It's Robert.
We were hunting...

20:07.332 --> 20:09.084
a boar...

20:15.674 --> 20:19.428
I should have
spent more time with you,

20:19.595 --> 20:22.264
shown you how to be a man.

20:25.392 --> 20:28.103
I was never meant to be a father.

20:48.373 --> 20:50.501
Go on.

20:50.667 --> 20:52.711
You don't want to see this.

21:06.767 --> 21:08.936
My fault.

21:09.019 --> 21:12.397
Too much wine,
missed my thrust.

21:22.074 --> 21:23.909
It stinks.

21:24.618 --> 21:27.204
It stinks like death.

21:27.287 --> 21:30.123
Don't think I can't smell it.

21:32.835 --> 21:35.587
I paid the bastard back, Ned.

21:36.296 --> 21:39.007
I drove my knife
right through his brain.

21:39.132 --> 21:41.552
You ask 'em if I didn't. Ask 'em!

21:42.803 --> 21:47.599
I want the funeral feast to be
the biggest the Kingdoms ever saw.

21:48.809 --> 21:52.271
And I want everyone
to taste the boar that got me.

21:55.983 --> 21:59.236
Now leave us, the lot of you.
I need to talk to Ned.

22:00.279 --> 22:02.489
- Robert, my sweet...
- Out, all of you!

22:22.801 --> 22:25.179
You damned fool.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.472
Paper and ink on the table.

22:27.598 --> 22:29.850
Write down what I say.

22:37.149 --> 22:41.486
"In the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

22:41.570 --> 22:42.738
"first of..."

22:42.821 --> 22:44.406
You know how it goes.

22:44.531 --> 22:47.075
Fill in the damn titles.

22:47.201 --> 22:49.244
"I hereby command

22:49.328 --> 22:52.122
"Eddard of House Stark..."

22:52.206 --> 22:54.708
titles, titles...

22:54.791 --> 22:58.253
"to serve as Lord Regent
and Protector of the Realm

22:58.378 --> 23:00.506
"upon my death,

23:00.589 --> 23:03.550
"to rule in my stead

23:03.675 --> 23:06.178
"until my son Joffrey comes of age."

23:24.571 --> 23:26.198
Give it over.

23:42.047 --> 23:43.924
Give it to the council...

23:44.049 --> 23:45.634
after I'm dead.

23:47.094 --> 23:49.096
At least they'll say I did this right,

23:49.263 --> 23:51.598
this one thing.

23:51.682 --> 23:53.475
You'll rule now.

23:54.810 --> 23:57.354
You'll hate it worse than I did...

23:58.188 --> 24:00.440
but you'll do it well.

24:04.027 --> 24:06.363
The girl...

24:06.446 --> 24:08.031
Daenerys.

24:09.950 --> 24:13.036
You were right.
Varys, Littlefinger,

24:13.161 --> 24:16.039
my brother... worthless.

24:16.123 --> 24:18.417
No one to tell me "no" but you.

24:20.544 --> 24:22.963
Only you.

24:26.049 --> 24:28.051
Let her live.

24:29.344 --> 24:31.388
Stop it, if it's not too late.

24:31.513 --> 24:33.182
I will.

24:33.348 --> 24:35.601
And my son...

24:36.476 --> 24:38.103
help him, Ned.

24:39.521 --> 24:41.565
Make him better than me.

24:42.524 --> 24:44.651
I'll...

24:45.485 --> 24:48.405
I'll do everything I can
to honour your memory.

24:48.488 --> 24:51.825
My memory.

24:53.368 --> 24:56.663
King Robert Baratheon,

24:56.788 --> 24:58.957
murdered by a pig.

25:02.544 --> 25:06.173
Give me something for the pain
and let me die.

25:21.021 --> 25:23.023
Give him milk of the poppy.

25:30.906 --> 25:33.075
He was reeling from the wine.

25:34.868 --> 25:36.870
He commanded us to...

25:36.954 --> 25:38.288
step aside, but...

25:39.957 --> 25:41.542
I failed him.

25:43.919 --> 25:46.547
No man could have
protected him from himself.

25:48.507 --> 25:50.384
I wonder, Ser Barristan,

25:50.509 --> 25:53.303
who gave the king this wine?

25:54.596 --> 25:57.432
His squire,
from the king's own skin.

25:57.558 --> 26:00.185
His squire? The Lannister boy?

26:00.978 --> 26:03.438
Such a dutiful boy
to make sure His Grace

26:03.564 --> 26:05.983
did not lack refreshment.

26:06.066 --> 26:09.570
I do hope the poor lad
does not blame himself.

26:17.578 --> 26:21.290
His Grace has had a change of heart
concerning Daenerys Targaryen.

26:23.417 --> 26:26.128
Whatever arrangements you made...

26:27.254 --> 26:29.673
unmake them. At once.

26:30.632 --> 26:33.093
I'm afraid those birds have flown.

26:34.011 --> 26:36.263
The girl is likely dead already.

26:46.064 --> 26:50.726
[Vezh fin saja rhaesheseres vo zigereo adoroon shiqethi.]
The stallion who mounts the world has no need for iron chairs.

26:50.736 --> 26:52.436
[K'asi assikhqoyisiri...]
According to the prophecy...

26:52.446 --> 26:54.938
[...vezh adothrae nakhaan rhaesheseri.]
...the stallion will ride to the ends of the earth.

26:54.948 --> 26:57.691
[Sorfosor nakha she Havazzhifi Kazga.]
The earth ends at the black salt sea.

26:57.701 --> 26:59.735
[Vo hrazef laz yoma evethiz.]
No horse can cross the poison water.

26:59.745 --> 27:01.904
[Sorfosor nakho vosecchi she havazh...]
The earth does not end at the sea...

27:01.914 --> 27:04.323
[...Sani sorfi vekha yomme havash.]
...there are many dirts beyond the sea.

27:04.333 --> 27:07.373
[Sorfo athyolari anni.]
The dirts of my birth. (The dirt where I was born)

27:09.296 --> 27:12.341
[Vo sorfo. Rhaeshi.]
Not dirts. Lands.

27:12.382 --> 27:14.760
[Rhaeshi, sek.]
Lands, yes...

27:16.595 --> 27:18.795
[Dalen rhaggati evetha ma ale vekhi she Vaes Seris]
There are thousands of ships in the free cities.

27:18.805 --> 27:20.839
[Hrazef ido fini ovethi yomme havazh.]
Wooden horses that fly across the sea...

27:20.849 --> 27:24.593
[Kisha vastoki vos alikh hrazefi ido m'adori shiqethi.]
Let's speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs.

27:24.603 --> 27:26.723
[Me vos ador. Me... me...]
it's not a chair. It's a...

27:30.108 --> 27:31.693
...throne.

27:33.987 --> 27:35.322
Throne.

27:35.447 --> 27:39.660
[Ador finaan khal nevasoe... che khaleesi.]
A chair for a King to sit upon,

27:39.785 --> 27:41.411
Or...

27:41.537 --> 27:43.205
[...che khaleesi]
...a Queen.

27:51.004 --> 27:54.206
[Khal vos zigereo adoroon anevasoe maan.]
A khal does not need a chair to sit upon.

27:54.216 --> 27:57.010
[ Me zigeree sajosoon disse.]
He only needs a steed.

28:17.155 --> 28:19.324
Can't you help me
make him understand?

28:19.408 --> 28:22.077
The Dothraki do things in their own time,
for their own reasons.

28:22.202 --> 28:25.747
Have patience, Khaleesi.
We will go home, I promise you.

28:25.831 --> 28:27.958
My brother was a fool, I know,

28:28.041 --> 28:30.627
but he was the rightful heir
to the Seven Kingdoms.

28:32.379 --> 28:34.131
Have I said something funny, ser?

28:34.214 --> 28:37.176
Forgive me, Khaleesi,
but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror

28:37.301 --> 28:39.803
didn't seize six of the Kingdoms
because they were his right.

28:39.928 --> 28:42.764
He had no right to them.
He seized them because he could.

28:42.806 --> 28:44.308
And because he had dragons.

28:44.391 --> 28:47.186
Ah, well, having a few dragons
makes things easier.

28:48.687 --> 28:52.149
- You don't believe it.
- Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi?

28:52.232 --> 28:55.068
I believe what my eyes
and ears report.

28:55.152 --> 28:57.779
As for the rest...
it was 300 years ago.

28:57.905 --> 28:59.615
Who knows what really happened?

28:59.740 --> 29:02.100
Now if you'll pardon me,
I'll seek out the merchant captain,

29:02.117 --> 29:03.827
see if he has any letters for me.

29:03.911 --> 29:06.663
- I'll come with you.
- No, no, don't trouble yourself.

29:06.788 --> 29:09.666
Enjoy the market.
I'll rejoin you soon enough.

29:17.257 --> 29:20.511
Psst! Jorah the Andal.

29:22.763 --> 29:24.848
The Spider sends his greetings

29:24.973 --> 29:27.059
and his congratulations.

29:29.102 --> 29:32.022
A royal pardon.
You can go home now.

29:41.532 --> 29:44.492
[Virzetha gizikhven! Mra qora! Mra qora!]
Sweet reds. I have it. I have it.

29:46.161 --> 29:48.163
[Virzetha gizikhven!]
Sweet reds...

29:48.247 --> 29:54.878
[Virzethi gizikhven vekha m'anhoon, Lysoon, Volantisoon, ma Halahisiroon.]
I have sweet reds from Lys, Volantis and the Arbor!

29:55.003 --> 29:57.830
[Sovikh Tirosh! Jelavena Andahloa.]
Tyroshi pear brandy! Andalish sours!

29:57.840 --> 30:00.217
[Mra qora! Mra qora!]
I have them! I have them!

30:00.717 --> 30:02.803
[Lekhi ha khaleesisaan?]
A taste for the Khaleesi?

30:03.512 --> 30:05.921
[M'anhoon vekha virzethi gizkhvena Dornoon, zhey erinak.]
I have a sweet red from Dorne, my lady.

30:05.931 --> 30:09.851
[At lekhi ma shafka ahakee yal hakesoon anni.]
One taste and you'll name your first child after me.

30:12.688 --> 30:15.888
My son already has his name,
but I'll try your summerwine.

30:16.024 --> 30:17.234
Just a taste.

30:17.860 --> 30:20.362
My lady, you are from Westeros.

30:20.487 --> 30:23.407
You have the honour of addressing Daenerys
of the House Targaryen,

30:24.116 --> 30:28.662
Khaleesi of the Riding Men
and Princess of the Seven Kingdoms.

30:28.787 --> 30:30.747
- Princess.
- Rise.

30:30.873 --> 30:32.875
I'd still like to taste that wine.

30:33.625 --> 30:36.211
That? Dornish swill.

30:36.378 --> 30:38.714
Not worthy of a princess.

30:38.797 --> 30:41.091
I have a dry red from the Arbor.

30:41.175 --> 30:43.135
Nectar of the gods.

30:43.260 --> 30:45.929
Let me give you a cask.
A... a gift.

30:46.054 --> 30:47.514
You honour me, ser.

30:47.639 --> 30:50.017
The honour...
the honour is all mine.

30:50.100 --> 30:51.935
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

30:55.647 --> 30:58.817
You know, there are many in your homeland
that pray for your return, Princess.

30:58.901 --> 31:00.569
I hope to repay
your kindness someday.

31:00.694 --> 31:02.070
Rakharo.

31:02.196 --> 31:04.198
[Azzohi haz khogare.]
Put down that cask.

31:06.450 --> 31:08.577
- Is something wrong?
- I have a thirst.

31:08.619 --> 31:10.537
Open it.

31:10.621 --> 31:13.207
The wine is for the khaleesi.
It's not for the likes of you.

31:13.373 --> 31:14.583
Open it.

31:26.178 --> 31:27.763
Pour.

31:27.846 --> 31:29.890
It would be a crime
to drink a wine this rich...

31:29.973 --> 31:33.018
- without at least giving it time to breathe.
- Do as he says.

31:34.061 --> 31:35.687
As the princess commands.

31:48.242 --> 31:50.202
Sweet, isn't it?

31:50.744 --> 31:52.496
Can you smell the fruit, ser?

31:53.830 --> 31:55.624
Taste it, my lord.

31:55.707 --> 31:59.586
Tell me that that is not the finest wine
that has ever touched your tongue.

32:02.798 --> 32:04.299
You first.

32:06.844 --> 32:08.387
Me?

32:08.512 --> 32:10.931
I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage.

32:11.056 --> 32:14.518
Besides, it is a poor wine merchant
who would drink up his own wares.

32:14.643 --> 32:16.353
You will drink.

32:33.745 --> 32:34.872
Stop him!

32:48.635 --> 32:50.053
Come.

32:57.186 --> 33:00.147
You came to us as outlaws...

33:00.189 --> 33:03.400
...poachers, rapers,

33:03.483 --> 33:05.569
killers, thieves.

33:05.736 --> 33:09.323
You came alone, in chains,

33:09.448 --> 33:11.116
without friends

33:11.200 --> 33:13.368
or honour.

33:13.452 --> 33:16.914
You came to us rich
and you came to us poor.

33:17.039 --> 33:19.416
Some of you bear the names

33:19.541 --> 33:21.418
of proud Houses,

33:22.211 --> 33:25.214
others only bastard names
or no names at all.

33:25.297 --> 33:27.090
It does not matter.

33:27.216 --> 33:30.219
All that is in the past.

33:30.302 --> 33:32.262
Here...

33:32.846 --> 33:35.349
on the Wall...

33:35.474 --> 33:37.851
we are all one House.

33:39.102 --> 33:42.272
- Tonight...
- You're allowed to look happy.

33:43.524 --> 33:46.151
You're going to be a ranger.

33:46.235 --> 33:48.403
Isn't that what you always wanted?

33:48.487 --> 33:50.906
I want to find my uncle.

33:51.740 --> 33:55.244
I know he's alive out there.
I know he is.

33:56.578 --> 34:00.290
I wish I could help you,
but I'm no ranger.

34:00.374 --> 34:02.376
It's the steward's life for me.

34:03.460 --> 34:05.504
There's honour in being a steward.

34:06.296 --> 34:08.005
Not much, really.

34:08.130 --> 34:09.591
But there's food.

34:13.011 --> 34:17.474
Here... you begin anew.

34:23.981 --> 34:27.484
A man of the Night's Watch...

34:29.152 --> 34:31.989
lives his life for the realm.

34:33.574 --> 34:35.409
Not for a king...

34:35.492 --> 34:38.328
or a lord, or the honour of this House

34:38.411 --> 34:40.789
or that House,

34:40.956 --> 34:43.667
not for gold or glory,

34:43.792 --> 34:46.128
or a woman's love,

34:46.210 --> 34:48.213
but for the realm

34:48.297 --> 34:51.007
and all the people in it.

34:51.132 --> 34:54.594
You've all learned
the words of the vow.

34:55.219 --> 34:57.681
Think carefully before you say them.

34:58.682 --> 35:00.601
The penalty for desertion...

35:01.768 --> 35:03.061
is death.

35:08.775 --> 35:10.861
You can take your vows here...

35:10.986 --> 35:12.696
tonight...

35:12.779 --> 35:14.114
at sunset.

35:14.823 --> 35:17.451
Do any of you still keep the old gods?

35:19.745 --> 35:21.580
I do, my lord.

35:21.663 --> 35:25.083
You'll want to take your vow
before a heart tree as your uncle did.

35:25.209 --> 35:26.251
Yes, my lord.

35:26.335 --> 35:29.254
You'll find a weirwood
a mile north of the Wall.

35:29.379 --> 35:32.174
And your old gods too, maybe.

35:33.300 --> 35:36.261
My lord, might I go as well?

35:36.386 --> 35:38.222
Does House Tarly keep the old gods?

35:38.388 --> 35:40.641
No, my lord.

35:41.350 --> 35:43.310
I was named in the light of the Seven,

35:43.393 --> 35:45.938
as my father was
and his father before him.

35:46.021 --> 35:49.942
Why would you forsake the gods
of your father and your House?

35:52.319 --> 35:54.196
The Night's Watch is my House now.

35:54.279 --> 35:56.823
The Seven have never answered my prayers.

35:58.075 --> 36:00.244
Perhaps the old gods will.

36:01.578 --> 36:03.080
As you wish, lad.

36:04.122 --> 36:07.042
You've all been assigned an order,

36:07.167 --> 36:09.962
according to our needs

36:10.045 --> 36:11.755
and your strengths.

36:12.422 --> 36:14.716
Halder to the builders.

36:15.717 --> 36:17.469
Pyp to the stewards.

36:17.594 --> 36:20.430
Toad to the builders.
Grenn to the rangers.

36:20.514 --> 36:22.474
Samwell to the stewards.

36:22.558 --> 36:26.144
Matthar to the rangers.
Dareon to the stewards.

36:26.228 --> 36:28.230
Balian to the rangers.

36:28.272 --> 36:29.857
Rast to the rangers.

36:30.023 --> 36:31.567
Jon to the stewards.

36:31.692 --> 36:33.402
Rancer to the builder.

36:33.485 --> 36:36.405
Echiel to the builders.
Gordo to the stewards.

36:36.488 --> 36:39.867
Niko to the rangers.
Escan to the rangers.

36:39.992 --> 36:42.995
Vorkoy to the builders.
Joby to the stables.

36:43.120 --> 36:46.331
Mink to the kitchens.
Allo to the builders.

36:46.415 --> 36:48.750
Nelugo to the rangers.

36:48.876 --> 36:52.379
May all the gods preserve you.

36:57.134 --> 36:59.678
Rangers with me.

37:00.596 --> 37:02.306
Builders!

37:21.325 --> 37:25.871
Samwell, you will assist me
in the rookery and library.

37:25.996 --> 37:29.917
Pyp, you will report
to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens.

37:30.042 --> 37:34.713
Luke, report to One-Eyed Joe
in the stables.

37:34.838 --> 37:38.675
Dareon, we are sending you
to Eastwatch.

37:38.842 --> 37:41.595
Present yourself to Borcas
when you arrive.

37:41.637 --> 37:44.848
Make no comment about his nose.

37:46.517 --> 37:49.102
Jon Snow,
Lord Commander Mormont

37:49.269 --> 37:52.189
has requested you
for his personal steward.

37:53.774 --> 37:56.902
Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals
and fetch hot water for his bath?

37:57.069 --> 38:00.781
Certainly. And keep a fire burning
in his chambers,

38:00.906 --> 38:03.700
change his sheets
and blankets daily

38:03.867 --> 38:07.496
and do everything else
the Lord Commander requires of you.

38:10.582 --> 38:12.042
Do you take me for a servant?

38:12.209 --> 38:14.753
We took you for a man
of the Night's Watch.

38:14.837 --> 38:17.673
But perhaps we were wrong in that.

38:18.632 --> 38:21.343
- May I go?
- As you wish.

38:27.140 --> 38:31.103
Jon, wait! Don't you see
what they're doing?

38:31.186 --> 38:33.105
I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all.

38:33.230 --> 38:34.982
He wanted it and he got it.

38:35.148 --> 38:37.568
Stewards are nothing but maids!

38:37.693 --> 38:39.695
I'm a better swordsman
and rider than any of you!

38:39.862 --> 38:42.823
- It's not fair.
- Fair?

38:43.615 --> 38:45.909
I was singing for a high lord
at Acorn Hall

38:46.034 --> 38:48.954
when he put his hand on my leg
and he wanted to see my cock.

38:49.037 --> 38:52.875
I pushed him away and he said he'd have
my hands cut off for stealing their silver.

38:52.958 --> 38:54.793
So now I'm here -
at the end of the world

38:54.918 --> 38:57.671
with no one to sing for
but old men and little shits like you.

38:57.754 --> 38:59.673
I'll never see my family again.

38:59.798 --> 39:01.884
I'll never be inside a woman again.

39:01.967 --> 39:03.135
So don't tell me about fair.

39:03.302 --> 39:07.055
I thought you were caught stealing
a wheel of cheese for your starving sister.

39:07.139 --> 39:11.268
Think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers
that a high lord tried to grab my cock?

39:13.770 --> 39:17.399
Could you sing me a song, Pyp?
I'd like to hear a song.

39:22.446 --> 39:24.198
Now listen to me.

39:24.323 --> 39:27.576
The old man is the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

39:27.743 --> 39:29.494
You'll be with him day and night.

39:29.578 --> 39:32.080
Yes, you'll clean his clothes.

39:32.164 --> 39:36.001
But you'll also take his letters,
attend him at meetings,

39:36.168 --> 39:38.003
squire for him in battle.

39:38.086 --> 39:41.715
You'll know everything,
be part of everything.

39:41.882 --> 39:43.425
And he asked for you himself.

39:44.676 --> 39:47.262
He wants to groom you for command.

39:52.851 --> 39:54.019
I just...

39:55.270 --> 39:57.064
I always wanted to be a ranger.

39:59.483 --> 40:01.318
I always wanted to be a wizard.

40:03.320 --> 40:05.697
What?

40:06.573 --> 40:08.033
No, I'm serious.

40:08.116 --> 40:10.702
So you'll stay
and say your words with me?

40:17.376 --> 40:20.546
Lord Stark... a moment.

40:21.713 --> 40:23.757
Alone, if you will.

40:33.141 --> 40:35.394
He named you Protector of the Realm.

40:37.187 --> 40:38.647
He did.

40:38.772 --> 40:40.399
She won't care.

40:40.482 --> 40:43.944
Give me an hour and I can put
a hundred swords at your command.

40:44.069 --> 40:45.821
And what should I do
with a hundred swords?

40:45.988 --> 40:49.783
Strike! Tonight, while the castle sleeps.

40:49.908 --> 40:53.328
We must get Joffrey away from his mother
and into our custody.

40:53.453 --> 40:57.249
Protector of the Realm or no,
he who holds the king holds the kingdom.

40:58.208 --> 41:01.420
Every moment you delay gives Cersei
another moment to prepare.

41:01.503 --> 41:04.423
By the time Robert dies,
it will be too late for the both of us.

41:04.506 --> 41:06.300
What about Stannis?

41:06.425 --> 41:09.636
Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei
and delivering them to Stannis?

41:09.678 --> 41:12.431
You have odd notions
about protecting the realm.

41:12.598 --> 41:14.183
Stannis is your older brother.

41:14.308 --> 41:16.435
This isn't about the bloody
line of succession.

41:16.518 --> 41:20.647
That didn't matter when you rebelled
against the Mad King. It shouldn't matter now.

41:22.608 --> 41:24.735
What's best for the Kingdoms?

41:24.776 --> 41:27.738
What's best for the people we rule?

41:28.906 --> 41:31.408
We all know what Stannis is.

41:31.533 --> 41:34.786
He inspires no love or loyalty.

41:34.870 --> 41:36.580
He's not a king.

41:37.998 --> 41:39.291
I am.

41:46.131 --> 41:47.883
Stannis is a commander.

41:48.884 --> 41:51.136
He's led men into war twice.

41:51.261 --> 41:52.971
He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet.

41:53.096 --> 41:55.891
Yes, he's a good soldier.
Everyone knows that. So was Robert.

41:57.226 --> 41:58.310
Tell me something.

41:58.435 --> 42:00.812
Do you still believe good soldiers
make good kings?

42:06.860 --> 42:11.281
I will not dishonour Robert's last hours
by shedding blood in his halls...

42:11.365 --> 42:13.825
and dragging frightened children
from their beds.

42:27.464 --> 42:30.133
You will sail to Dragonstone tonight.

42:30.300 --> 42:32.886
You will place this in the hand
of Stannis Baratheon.

42:34.638 --> 42:36.348
Not his steward...

42:37.307 --> 42:39.768
not his captain of the guard...

42:39.852 --> 42:42.145
and not his wife.

42:47.150 --> 42:48.861
Only Stannis himself.

42:48.986 --> 42:51.864
Yes, my lord.

42:54.324 --> 42:55.576
Now leave us.

43:05.002 --> 43:07.379
My Lord Protector.

43:13.010 --> 43:14.970
The king has no trueborn sons.

43:16.013 --> 43:17.556
Joffrey and Tommen...

43:17.723 --> 43:19.600
are Jaime Lannister's bastards.

43:20.809 --> 43:25.105
- So when the king dies...
- The throne passes to his brother...

43:26.648 --> 43:28.025
Lord Stannis.

43:28.984 --> 43:30.360
So it would seem.

43:32.196 --> 43:34.448
- Unless...
- There is no "unless".

43:34.573 --> 43:36.867
He is the rightful heir.
Nothing can change that.

43:37.034 --> 43:39.077
And he cannot take the throne
without your help.

43:39.203 --> 43:43.207
You would be wise to deny it to him
and to make sure Joffrey succeeds.

43:46.168 --> 43:48.879
Do you have a shred of honour?

43:49.046 --> 43:52.799
You are now Hand of the King
and Protector of the Realm.

43:52.883 --> 43:55.093
All of the power is yours.
You need only...

43:55.260 --> 43:57.721
reach out and take it.

43:57.888 --> 43:59.932
Make peace with the Lannisters.

44:00.057 --> 44:03.477
Release the Imp.
Wed your daughter to Joffrey.

44:04.478 --> 44:06.313
We've plenty of time to get rid of Stannis,

44:06.438 --> 44:09.858
and if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems
when he comes into his throne,

44:09.983 --> 44:12.236
we simply reveal his little secret

44:12.319 --> 44:15.447
- and seat Lord Renly there instead.
- We?

44:15.614 --> 44:19.368
You'll need someone to share these burdens,
I assure you.

44:19.493 --> 44:21.537
My price would be modest.

44:22.412 --> 44:24.665
What you suggest is treason.

44:24.748 --> 44:26.875
Only if we lose.

44:29.545 --> 44:32.214
Make peace with the Lannisters,
you say...

44:33.715 --> 44:35.801
with the people who tried to murder my boy.

44:35.968 --> 44:39.388
We only make peace
with our enemies, my lord.

44:39.555 --> 44:41.723
That's why it's called "making peace".

44:41.807 --> 44:45.060
No. I won't do it.

44:45.853 --> 44:47.688
So it will be Stannis and war?

44:47.729 --> 44:49.982
There is no other choice.

44:50.899 --> 44:52.442
He is the heir.

44:53.443 --> 44:55.028
So why did you call me here?

44:55.195 --> 44:57.239
Not for my wisdom, clearly.

44:58.866 --> 45:00.951
You promised Catelyn
you would help me.

45:01.076 --> 45:03.871
The queen has a dozen knights
and a hundred men-at-arms -

45:03.954 --> 45:07.833
enough to overwhelm what remains
of my household guard.

45:07.916 --> 45:09.751
I need the gold cloaks.

45:10.878 --> 45:13.046
The City Watch is 2,000 strong...

45:13.839 --> 45:16.300
and sworn to defend the king's peace.

45:19.052 --> 45:20.762
Look at you.

45:21.889 --> 45:23.932
You know what you want me to do,

45:24.016 --> 45:26.059
you know it has to be done,

45:26.143 --> 45:28.270
but it's not honourable, so...

45:28.979 --> 45:30.772
the words stick in your throat.

45:31.523 --> 45:33.901
When the queen proclaims one king

45:33.984 --> 45:35.736
and the Hand proclaims another,

45:35.861 --> 45:38.530
whose peace do the gold cloaks protect?

45:40.240 --> 45:42.117
Who do they follow?

45:47.164 --> 45:49.041
The man who pays them.

46:34.336 --> 46:38.799
Hear my words
and bear witness to my vow.

46:38.966 --> 46:42.344
Night gathers
and now my watch begins.

46:42.386 --> 46:45.639
It shall not end until my death.

46:45.764 --> 46:48.016
I shall take no wife,

46:48.100 --> 46:51.103
hold no lands,
father no children.

46:51.645 --> 46:55.315
I shall wear no crowns
and win no glory.

46:55.399 --> 46:59.069
I shall live and die at my post.

46:59.152 --> 47:02.072
I am the sword in the darkness.

47:02.155 --> 47:04.825
I am the watcher on the walls.

47:04.992 --> 47:08.871
I am the shield that guards
the realms of men.

47:08.996 --> 47:12.833
I pledge my life and honour
to the Night's Watch,

47:13.000 --> 47:16.795
for this night
and all the nights to come.

47:16.962 --> 47:19.047
You knelt as boys.

47:19.173 --> 47:21.633
Rise now as men of the Night's Watch.

47:35.022 --> 47:36.773
Well done. Well done.

47:43.697 --> 47:45.532
What's he got there?

47:45.657 --> 47:48.660
To me, Ghost.
Bring it here.

47:50.787 --> 47:53.165
Gods be good!

47:59.755 --> 48:01.757
What will they do to him?

48:04.801 --> 48:07.221
When the khalasar rides,
he'll be leashed to a saddle

48:07.304 --> 48:10.891
and forced to run behind the horses
for as long as he can.

48:10.974 --> 48:12.851
And when he falls?

48:14.144 --> 48:17.022
I saw a man last nine miles once.

48:18.732 --> 48:20.901
King Robert still wants me dead.

48:20.984 --> 48:23.278
This poisoner was the first.
He won't be the last.

48:23.403 --> 48:27.241
I thought he'd leave me alone
now that my brother is gone.

48:27.366 --> 48:29.993
He will never leave you alone.

48:30.160 --> 48:33.413
If you ride to darkest Asshai,
his assassins will follow you.

48:33.497 --> 48:35.958
If you sailed all the way
to the Basilisk Isles,

48:36.041 --> 48:37.334
his spies would tell him.

48:37.459 --> 48:40.462
He will never abandon the hunt.

48:40.587 --> 48:44.466
You're a Targaryen -
the last Targaryen.

48:44.591 --> 48:46.635
Your son will have Targaryen blood

48:46.760 --> 48:49.304
with 40,000 riders behind him.

48:50.931 --> 48:52.683
He will not have my son.

48:53.725 --> 48:55.644
He will not have you either, Khaleesi.

49:28.594 --> 49:30.512
[Zhey jalan atthirari anni.]
Moon of my life.

49:31.096 --> 49:32.598
[Hash azisi?]
Are you hurt?

[Jora Andahli, ]
Jorah the Andal,

49:45.152 --> 49:47.905
[okki zhille hrazef.]
I heard what you did.

49:47.988 --> 49:51.575
[Fin allayafa shafka drogikhoon anni, me shafki.]
Choose any horse you wish, it is yours.

49:55.662 --> 49:59.750
[Anha asshilak jin azh shafkea haji rekoon et shafka.]
I make this gift to you for what you did.

50:05.088 --> 50:09.968
[Ma rizhaan anni, vezh fin asaja rhaesheseres, ]
And to my son, the stallion who will mount the world,

50:10.093 --> 50:13.555
[maan anha valloshak azh akka.]
I will also pledge a gift.

50:13.639 --> 50:17.851
[Maan anha vazhak jin ador shiqethi...]
I will give him the iron chair...

50:17.976 --> 50:21.980
[...finaan neva ave maisi mae.]
...that his mother's father sat upon.

50:22.814 --> 50:27.134
[Anha vazhak maan Rhaeshis Andahli.]
I will give The Lands of the Andals. (I will give him Seven Kingdoms)

50:27.402 --> 50:31.949
[Anha, zhey Drogo, atak jin.]
I, Drogo, will do this.

50:32.491 --> 50:35.901
[Anha vidrik khalasares anni jim finaan nakhoe rhaesheser...]
I will take my Khalasar west to where the world ends...

50:35.911 --> 50:41.416
[majin adothrak hrazef ido yomme Havazzhifi Kazga...]
...and ride wooden horses across the black salt water...

50:41.583 --> 50:45.045
[ven et vo khal avvos.]
...as no Khal has done before.

50:47.130 --> 50:51.760
[Anha vaddrivak mahrazhis fini ondee khogar shiqethi...]
I will kill the men in iron suits...

50:51.885 --> 50:55.245
[...ma vohharak okrenegwin mori.]

50:57.266 --> 51:01.061

[...ma afichak vojjor samva Vaesaan Dothrak.]

51:10.863 --> 51:12.906
[Ki jini anha astak asqoy...]

51:12.990 --> 51:15.951
[anha, Drogo ki Bharbosi.]
...l, Drogo, son of Bharbo.

51:17.536 --> 51:22.332
[Ki jini anha astak asqoy hatif Maisi Krazaaji]
I swear before the Mother of Mountains...

51:22.416 --> 51:25.456
[...kash shieraki vitihiri asavvasoon.]
...as the stars look down in witness.

51:26.003 --> 51:28.922
[Kash shieraki vitihiri asavvasoon.]
As the stars look down in witness.

51:58.660 --> 52:00.037
Lord Stark!

52:00.162 --> 52:02.039
- Stop!
- No, all right.

52:02.164 --> 52:03.999
It's all right.
Let him through.

52:04.041 --> 52:07.753
Lord Stark, King Joffrey and the Queen Regent
request your presence in the Throne Room.

52:07.878 --> 52:09.630
King Joffrey?

52:09.755 --> 52:11.215
King Robert is gone.

52:11.298 --> 52:13.509
The gods give him rest.

52:25.270 --> 52:27.564
All is accomplished.
The City Watch is yours.

52:27.689 --> 52:29.358
Good.

52:30.108 --> 52:32.152
Is Lord Renly joining us?

52:33.570 --> 52:36.657
I fear Lord Renly has left the city.

52:37.407 --> 52:40.702
He rode through the Old Gate
an hour before dawn

52:40.869 --> 52:44.706
with Ser Loras Tyrell
and some 50 retainers.

52:44.831 --> 52:48.335
Last seen galloping south
in some haste.

53:09.147 --> 53:11.233
We stand behind you, Lord Stark.

53:20.659 --> 53:22.411
All hail His Grace,

53:22.494 --> 53:25.372
Joffrey of Houses Baratheon
and Lannister

53:25.414 --> 53:27.124
the First of His Name,

53:27.249 --> 53:29.459
King of the Andals and the First Men,

53:29.501 --> 53:31.837
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

53:32.004 --> 53:35.048
and Protector of the Realm.

53:52.983 --> 53:56.862
I command the council to make all necessary
arrangements for my coronation.

53:57.029 --> 53:59.573
I wish to be crowned within the fortnight.

53:59.656 --> 54:02.492
Today I shall accept oaths of fealty

54:02.618 --> 54:04.494
from my loyal councillors.

54:08.248 --> 54:09.750
Ser Barristan...

54:09.875 --> 54:13.378
I believe no man here
could ever question your honour.

54:24.723 --> 54:28.143
King Robert's seal - unbroken.

54:35.651 --> 54:39.071
"Lord Eddard Stark is herein named...

54:39.238 --> 54:40.989
"Protector of the Realm...

54:42.115 --> 54:44.034
"to rule as regent...

54:44.159 --> 54:46.787
"until the heir come of age."

54:47.996 --> 54:50.207
May I see that letter, Ser Barristan?

54:58.757 --> 55:00.342
Protector of the Realm.

55:04.763 --> 55:07.474
Is this meant to be your shield, Lord Stark?

55:08.100 --> 55:10.143
A piece of paper?

55:13.313 --> 55:16.358
- Those were the king's words.
- We have a new king now.

55:19.069 --> 55:22.322
Lord Eddard, when we last spoke
you offered me some counsel.

55:23.448 --> 55:25.701
Allow me to return the courtesy.

55:25.784 --> 55:27.995
Bend the knee, my lord.

55:28.078 --> 55:31.039
Bend the knee
and swear loyalty to my son...

55:31.874 --> 55:34.334
and we shall allow you
to live out your days

55:34.459 --> 55:37.087
in the grey waste you call home.

55:37.171 --> 55:39.423
Your son has no claim to the throne.

55:39.548 --> 55:40.757
Liar!

55:40.841 --> 55:43.760
You condemn yourself
with your own mouth, Lord Stark.

55:43.886 --> 55:45.721
Ser Barristan, seize this traitor.

55:47.556 --> 55:50.475
Ser Barristan is a good man,
a loyal man. Do him no harm.

55:53.145 --> 55:54.479
You think he stands alone?

55:57.816 --> 56:00.861
Kill him! Kill all of them!
I command it!

56:00.986 --> 56:05.032
Commander!
Take the queen and her children into custody.

56:05.157 --> 56:09.286
Escort them back to the royal apartments
and keep them there, under guard.

56:09.411 --> 56:11.205
Men of the Watch!

56:15.167 --> 56:17.711
I want no bloodshed.

56:17.836 --> 56:20.339
Tell your men to lay down their swords.

56:20.464 --> 56:22.424
No one needs to die.

56:24.218 --> 56:26.261
Now!

56:36.772 --> 56:39.441
I did warn you not to trust me.

56:41.872 --> 56:46.441
WHAT THE FUCK LITTLEFINGER?!?!
Sync, corrected & Dothraki dialogue by <font color="#3333FF">MALAY DEV</font>

56:50.872 --> 56:54.872

No sugarcoatings. It is as it is spoken.
