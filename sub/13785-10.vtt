01:38.807 --> 01:40.433
Ooh!

01:40.601 --> 01:42.310
Jesus Christ!

01:42.478 --> 01:44.395
What's wrong?

01:44.563 --> 01:47.273
What's wrong?
It fuckin' hurts, Doc.

01:47.441 --> 01:48.941
What do you think's wrong?

01:49.109 --> 01:51.569
As the particular mix of stupidity

01:51.737 --> 01:54.322
and self-pity that moved you
is of no interest to me,

01:54.490 --> 01:56.324
I will not put to you the question

01:56.492 --> 01:59.994
of why you would
abrade a healing wound.

02:00.162 --> 02:03.581
I was examining myself for fuckin' pus.

02:03.749 --> 02:06.209
Bullshit.
(coughing)

02:08.211 --> 02:09.961
I have a patient

02:10.130 --> 02:12.965
whose shattered foot
is going gangrenous.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.801
I'll likely amputate.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.345
He's a salesman.

02:17.513 --> 02:19.597
His livelihood

02:19.765 --> 02:22.850
depends on walking.

02:24.311 --> 02:26.604
I'll return tomorrow.

02:26.772 --> 02:29.482
If I see any further evidence
of self-mutilation,

02:29.650 --> 02:31.776
that will be the last day I treat you.

02:31.944 --> 02:34.737
(coughs)

02:40.118 --> 02:42.078
One wonders, sir,

02:42.246 --> 02:45.498
if last evening installed in your hostel

02:45.666 --> 02:48.376
a woman of exotic appearance,

02:48.544 --> 02:51.629
not perhaps gypsy by extraction.

02:51.797 --> 02:54.340
What would your
business with her be

02:54.508 --> 02:56.509
if she had?

02:56.677 --> 02:58.344
To hear my fortune told.

02:58.512 --> 03:01.931
- There'll be none of that on these premises.
- Nor were those my true intentions.

03:02.099 --> 03:05.351
- Your query is impertinent.
- (coin clanks)

03:05.519 --> 03:07.979
Is the lady here?

03:09.648 --> 03:12.316
- 2C.
- As your faith must proscribe

03:12.484 --> 03:16.112
receiving bribes,
credit the five toward her stay.

03:21.827 --> 03:24.287
- Thanks so much, Aunt Lou.
- All right.

03:24.454 --> 03:27.415
You know I'll notify you
first word from the freight office

03:27.583 --> 03:30.835
- about your boys remains.
- All right.

03:34.548 --> 03:39.218
There's a stout woman, the Countess Berman,
fires and hires for the troupe.

03:39.386 --> 03:42.513
You will meet her at the theater
should you appear and apply.

03:42.681 --> 03:46.434
The devout Shaunessey has
a week in advance to your account.

03:46.602 --> 03:48.394
Take it back from him.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.229
I won't take money from you.

03:50.397 --> 03:53.232
Are you not being quite absurd,

03:53.400 --> 03:56.527
in the self-serving way of your sex?

03:56.695 --> 03:58.821
You come here penniless,
a supplicant--

03:58.989 --> 04:01.782
- For learning.
- Well well well.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.076
And to learn, must you not live?

04:04.244 --> 04:07.955
And how will you do so amidst
the thoroughfare's depravities?

04:10.250 --> 04:12.001
Let me stay in the theater.

04:12.169 --> 04:13.878
(laughs)

04:14.046 --> 04:17.214
At a minimum, for the career
to which you aspire

04:17.382 --> 04:20.216
you show the requisite presumption.

04:27.059 --> 04:30.269
No small part,
the hotel's amelioration

04:30.437 --> 04:31.896
under your regime.

04:32.064 --> 04:35.316
The nigger cook-- no small part.

04:35.484 --> 04:37.526
I heard you.

04:43.659 --> 04:48.913
Hmm, a tenant when last I was
resident in the previous regime.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.509
I thought the evening went well.

05:01.677 --> 05:04.136
- Wonderful.
- Very much to our purposes--

05:04.304 --> 05:06.138
the idea of us in the camp.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.975
And what about that

05:09.142 --> 05:11.018
beautiful harem dance

05:11.186 --> 05:14.480
by that darling little
dark-haired prostitute?

05:17.484 --> 05:18.943
(gunshot)

05:19.111 --> 05:21.070
- My God.
- (gunshot)

05:21.238 --> 05:23.864
Make yourself fuckin'
small, Mrs. Ellsworth!

05:24.032 --> 05:26.867
(people shouting)

05:30.163 --> 05:31.330
My goodness.

05:31.498 --> 05:34.083
I believe someone's shooting
at the former tenant.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.298
Keep your fuckin' head down!

05:41.466 --> 05:44.427
Get to the fuckin' schoolhouse!
Particular attention to the foundling

05:44.594 --> 05:46.637
and send fuckin' Trixie over here!

05:47.931 --> 05:50.349
Oh, just some nonsense
among the ordinaries, sir.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.393
Getting Mrs. Ellsworth under cover.

05:52.561 --> 05:56.188
Excess of fuckin' caution,
but you yourself, sir, are absolutely safe!

05:56.356 --> 05:58.524
Absolutely safe, sir.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.154
Wire Bullock in Sturgis.

06:03.321 --> 06:06.532
"Return's urgently required."
In fuckin' generalities only,

06:06.700 --> 06:08.951
otherwise that maniac'll
come back shooting.

06:09.119 --> 06:13.039
No, not that way. Don't want that cocksucker
knowing nothing of our business.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.834
Upstairs and fuckin' around you'll
find the fuckin' telegraph. Johnny.

06:17.002 --> 06:19.086
Oughtn't someone look out for who fired?

06:19.254 --> 06:21.422
Richardson, look into who fired.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.760
- What was it?
- The business of others.

06:25.927 --> 06:28.888
Shall we review the bidding
in my fuckin' office?

06:29.056 --> 06:32.516
- Oh, I need to take off my corset.
- No one objects to that here.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.761
Al: Easily as it could have
been some hoople-head

07:08.929 --> 07:10.971
not knowing who
or what he was shooting at,

07:11.139 --> 07:14.683
it's likely prudent
to credit you as the target.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.602
Yes.

07:16.770 --> 07:20.439
If I'd been aimed at,
of course... (chuckles)

07:20.607 --> 07:22.775
dozens of authors would
need be considered.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.277
- Yes.
- So I know someone's in there

07:25.445 --> 07:29.615
vary your replies, such as, "Yes...

07:29.783 --> 07:31.492
and I'd be one of them."

07:31.660 --> 07:35.246
That wouldn't be
very grateful of me.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.543
(Alma gasps)

07:40.710 --> 07:43.087
It's horrible being shot at.
Never gets no better.

07:43.255 --> 07:44.505
- (knock on door)
- Yeah.

07:44.673 --> 07:48.217
- What the fuck?
- Assuming she ain't got

07:48.385 --> 07:51.262
the smell of gunpowder
on her fingers,

07:51.429 --> 07:53.472
I'm leaving you to her.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.851
Th-thank you, Mr. Swearengen.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.150
Who the fuck shot at her?

08:04.317 --> 08:07.111
Who the fuck knows? Hearst?
Her first husband's family?

08:07.279 --> 08:10.656
They both work with the fuckin' Pinkertons.
Maybe they're now allied.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.200
Someone should see
to the child as her fuckin' heir.

08:13.368 --> 08:15.744
Being looked to.
Just you fuckin' look after that one

08:15.912 --> 08:18.581
till matters clarify.
Don't think of tossing the place.

08:18.748 --> 08:22.501
Every fuckin' valuable's inventoried.
Get Tom Nuttall! Cheyenne's off.

08:22.669 --> 08:25.045
- God damn it!
- Second-rate deployment, Dan,

08:25.213 --> 08:28.340
sending you off for reinforcements
to come back to a camp in ruins.

08:28.508 --> 08:29.842
I'll pack, unpack, repack.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.928
Whoever you intended to fuck,
send monies to bring her here.

08:33.096 --> 08:36.849
Who I intended to fuck won't ride
a stagecoach. Makes her puke.

08:37.017 --> 08:40.936
Toast and eggs or toast and bacon--
she can choose or she can mix 'em,

08:41.104 --> 08:43.688
- whatever she wants.
- Why the fuck are you telling me?

08:51.323 --> 08:53.741
Every step a fuckin' adventure.

08:53.909 --> 08:56.952
Collect fuckin' Ellsworth.
Nothing of her being shot at.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.205
What am I to say I'm collecting him for?

08:59.372 --> 09:02.666
- Just knock him out and bring him in.
- Do you want to close?

09:02.834 --> 09:04.335
No, I don't wanna close.

09:04.502 --> 09:09.131
Fuckin' Hearst's to see not one single sign
on any fuckin' front that he's had

09:09.299 --> 09:12.885
half a cunt hair's effect on any
of the comings and goings in this camp.

09:13.053 --> 09:18.849
Telegram's sent to the sheriff.
Blazanov's helping Merrick dress.

09:19.017 --> 09:23.395
- Why the fuck would you say that to me?
- Merrick, that was beat up yesterday,

09:23.563 --> 09:26.899
is being helped to dress by Blazanov.

09:27.067 --> 09:30.444
Now Blazanov sent the telegram
to the sheriff,

09:30.612 --> 09:34.365
- so's Merrick could come do his part.
- All right.

09:34.532 --> 09:36.700
Should I relieve Adams
at the schoolhouse?

09:36.868 --> 09:38.744
Please.

09:38.912 --> 09:43.499
Let Adams come back here,
be available for whatever nefarious

09:43.667 --> 09:48.087
fuckin' carryings-on you assign him
'cause I do not take orders from you.

09:59.099 --> 10:02.977
Before she eats, she somersaults
and don't want no one to see.

10:03.144 --> 10:06.480
In fact, I rarely eat before noon.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.899
Maybe you just ain't found
what you like to eat yet.

10:09.067 --> 10:11.485
Get out, Jewel.

10:19.369 --> 10:22.788
- Did you ever have bacon?
- I very well might.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.790
- Goodbye, Jewel.
- Thank you.

10:29.045 --> 10:32.298
- That was so considerate of her.
- Fascinated by you.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.229
If you saw who it was and want to say,

10:47.397 --> 10:49.481
I wouldn't have to tell Al.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.109
I didn't see.

10:52.277 --> 10:56.071
And I'm very grateful to be
under Mr. Swearengen's protection.

10:56.239 --> 11:01.368
- Yeah, he's a prince.
- In the sheriff's absence, I mean.

11:01.536 --> 11:04.580
Good a place as any for you to be...

11:06.166 --> 11:08.542
in the sheriff's absence.

11:08.710 --> 11:11.045
(chuckles)

11:26.686 --> 11:29.063
She somersaulted and ate

11:29.230 --> 11:32.191
and says her entire fuckin'
dietary outlook has changed.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.401
What plate did she et from?

11:34.569 --> 11:36.445
She ate from them fuckin' both.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.201
What a world.

11:42.369 --> 11:45.579
A woman in innocent transit;

11:45.747 --> 11:47.790
a wayward shot
from some watering hole,

11:47.957 --> 11:50.667
do you suppose,
prompted by a surfeit of spirits?

11:50.835 --> 11:53.796
Exuberant punctuations
of some sort?

11:53.963 --> 11:56.215
Do you believe anything you say?

11:56.383 --> 11:58.217
I am hypothesizing.

11:58.385 --> 12:02.096
And have you some private hypothesis
as to my possible role?

12:02.263 --> 12:05.724
- In the shooting at Mrs. Ellsworth?
- In the rising of the sun.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.685
I would hypothesize

12:08.853 --> 12:12.773
as to the latter possibility, sir,
before imagining you involved with the first.

12:12.941 --> 12:16.610
Oh, come, Jarry.
My holdings butt up against hers.

12:16.778 --> 12:19.405
I value efficiencies and economies

12:19.572 --> 12:20.906
of consolidation.

12:21.074 --> 12:24.618
Haven't I reason to nudge her
toward a sale?

12:28.581 --> 12:31.458
Men of a certain caliber

12:31.626 --> 12:34.253
cannot allow fastidious morality

12:34.421 --> 12:38.257
to distract them from the exigencies
of commerce, can they, Mr. Hearst?

12:38.425 --> 12:42.177
And did you heave up
your responsibilities

12:42.345 --> 12:45.472
upon broad and reconciled
shoulders?

12:45.640 --> 12:48.684
- No.
- Perhaps then, rather,

12:48.852 --> 12:53.814
at this moment you are Socrates
to my Alcibiades,

12:53.982 --> 12:56.733
taking it upon yourself to edify me.

13:00.363 --> 13:02.281
Are you saying you want to fuck me?

13:02.449 --> 13:03.991
- (knock on door)
- What?

13:04.159 --> 13:06.827
You keep calling yourself
Alcibiades to my Socrates.

13:06.995 --> 13:10.164
Are you proposing some sort of a
homosexual connection between us?

13:10.331 --> 13:12.374
I forgot that part of the story.

13:13.626 --> 13:16.086
- (whispering)
- Wait.

13:18.548 --> 13:21.300
But if I were courting you, Mr. Hearst,

13:21.468 --> 13:23.969
I claim no allure of my own,

13:24.137 --> 13:28.182
suggesting only the mutuality of our
interests concerning the upcoming elections

13:28.349 --> 13:31.226
grants my suit some small virtue.

13:31.394 --> 13:34.271
As you gaze upon me, sir,

13:34.439 --> 13:37.483
recall that some unions
of convenience

13:37.650 --> 13:39.776
may outlast those
conceived in passion.

13:39.944 --> 13:43.822
- Get up off your knees.
- Of course.

13:43.990 --> 13:47.367
Elections cannot
inconvenience me.

13:47.535 --> 13:50.037
They ratify my will or I neuter them.

13:50.205 --> 13:53.499
- Compelling perspective.
- Time to go back to Yankton.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.667
- For me?
- Yes.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.839
Locked.

14:08.723 --> 14:11.433
The troops in Sturgis
will await your instructions--

14:11.601 --> 14:13.268
Thank you very much.

14:25.323 --> 14:26.657
"I like winter

14:26.824 --> 14:30.536
when snow and ice
cover the ground."

14:40.255 --> 14:42.089
"I like winter

14:42.257 --> 14:46.051
when snow and ice cover...

15:02.777 --> 15:05.237
- What are you doing here?
- Too afraid.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.781
If you were too afraid,
you wouldn't be here.

15:07.949 --> 15:10.409
Too afraid to explain.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.244
He's got a note pinned to him, Al.

15:12.412 --> 15:15.872
Take it off him. Then stick him
in the eye with the fucking pin.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.332
(whimpers)

15:17.500 --> 15:19.459
He don't mean it.

15:24.382 --> 15:25.924
Tell him, "Nothing."

15:26.092 --> 15:28.135
- I'll just keep quiet.
- No.

15:28.303 --> 15:30.804
Tell EB, "Nothing's going on."

15:30.972 --> 15:33.765
And then tell him,
"If I wanted to tell you anything,

15:33.933 --> 15:37.144
I'd have told you. Don't send
the imbecile over with no more notes."

15:37.312 --> 15:39.104
I can't remember all that.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.440
Can you remember
"Nothing's going on"?

15:41.608 --> 15:43.066
- Yes.
- Tell him that then.

15:43.234 --> 15:45.485
Thank you.

15:53.911 --> 15:57.205
- The Mrs. Ellsworth was shot at?
- Got her upstairs.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.791
I figured...

15:59.959 --> 16:02.711
we'd hunker down till matters clarify.

16:02.879 --> 16:04.463
Lovely.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.715
What did the geek say
walking past you?

16:06.883 --> 16:10.093
"The girls in here are pretty."

16:10.261 --> 16:12.471
The fool husband ought soon appear.

16:12.639 --> 16:16.475
Some small number to deal
with his dudgeon,

16:16.643 --> 16:19.144
main force in reserve for Bullock.

16:21.439 --> 16:23.649
Okay.

16:37.080 --> 16:40.916
How did sentiment incline in this joint
when Bullock and Harry spoke last?

16:41.084 --> 16:43.752
- Glad when they finished.
- As to who had the upper hand?

16:43.920 --> 16:46.338
Fucking cross-legged pose
your man struck, Tom,

16:46.506 --> 16:48.674
may have swayed the diarrhea faction.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.884
Johnny:
Creek was having its way with Harry.

16:51.052 --> 16:55.180
The fuck was the logic when he sent
that giant captain to fight you?

16:55.348 --> 16:58.392
- Get me killed.
- It wasn't to get you killed.

16:58.559 --> 17:01.937
His man finally kills you
after a more or less equal fight?

17:02.105 --> 17:03.939
I gotta go reassure my Jew.

17:04.107 --> 17:08.402
Out of boredom's why he put
that fight together. Same with this too.

17:08.569 --> 17:11.613
Fucking shots at her fore and aft.

17:11.781 --> 17:15.534
Wants to see he's made people afraid,
so he knows he's a fucking big shot.

17:15.702 --> 17:19.996
Exactly fucking correct, Tom.
If this was overture to an onslaught,

17:20.164 --> 17:24.209
he'd have let them pistoleros
loose by now to start the actual killing.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.670
That's the keenest
of fucking assessments.

17:26.838 --> 17:29.256
Mightn't that argue
for my trip to Cheyenne?

17:29.424 --> 17:31.675
He ain't waiting no fucking week, Dan.

17:31.843 --> 17:35.053
I leave here full of confidence
knowing you're all thinking in concert.

17:35.221 --> 17:39.182
But I'd as soon not die
fighting 25 against four--

17:39.350 --> 17:43.061
you being my missing fifth, the equal
of 10 of Hearst's fucking mercenaries,

17:43.229 --> 17:46.064
and Bullock,
who's no fucking slouch either,

17:46.232 --> 17:48.066
if he ever gets the fuck back,

17:48.234 --> 17:50.110
bringing the odds closer to even.

17:50.278 --> 17:54.698
Well, her Jew's got sand
if you tell him where to point the gun.

17:54.866 --> 17:58.744
I'd trust a fucking wire to Cheyenne
if I knew someone to send it to.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.539
Far as that, there's Hawkeye.

18:04.041 --> 18:06.084
You were told never to say his name.

18:06.252 --> 18:09.463
Well, now I did.
And I'd trust him to hire the guns.

18:09.630 --> 18:12.257
And the hiring would take place where?

18:12.425 --> 18:14.509
Up that squaw's cunt he's fucking?

18:14.677 --> 18:16.428
Squaw's in Lead, not Cheyenne.

18:16.596 --> 18:20.724
Did he take vows of abstinence in Cheyenne?
Do they let him have wires in his monastery?

18:20.892 --> 18:23.685
I'd trust Hawkeye,
once he learned the situation,

18:23.853 --> 18:27.689
to hire the guns without stealing,
to herd 'em back here to help us out,

18:27.857 --> 18:29.524
not stopping to get laid in Lead.

18:29.692 --> 18:32.944
- Can Hawkeye read?
- He can, and I can put my words

18:33.112 --> 18:36.448
such in the wire he'll take my meaning
and prying cocksuckers won't.

18:36.616 --> 18:40.035
Go get the fucking Russian,
send the fucking wire.

18:40.203 --> 18:43.371
- Out the front or by the stairs?
- By the stairs, by the fucking stairs.

18:45.541 --> 18:47.959
We want his piss-pot's play hours

18:48.127 --> 18:50.796
occupied by confusion and grievance.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.882
We want him sitting,
sulking like a three-year-old

18:54.050 --> 18:55.884
whose toys won't do his bidding.

18:56.052 --> 18:59.221
I had a fucking jack-in-the-box.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.097
I'd turn and turn

19:01.265 --> 19:04.935
and turn that fucking handle,
and the jack, he'd never jump.

19:06.979 --> 19:10.482
If she'd complete her walk to the bank...

19:11.901 --> 19:14.820
she'd confound this motherless cunt.

19:14.987 --> 19:18.156
Tea for two, Jewel, on a fucking tray!

19:18.324 --> 19:20.617
When did you start giving
that cocksucker Swearengen

19:20.785 --> 19:23.161
a "by your leave"
and "if you fucking say so"?

19:23.329 --> 19:25.914
Jane.

19:27.291 --> 19:31.253
All's I asked, Jane, did he know
you was relieving me?

19:31.420 --> 19:34.381
Maybe Swearengen's coordinating
strategy 'cause the sheriff

19:34.549 --> 19:37.717
being gone campaigning,
his deputy didn't jump to take charge.

19:37.885 --> 19:41.638
We just thought we could release you
to other responsibilities, Mr. Utter,

19:41.806 --> 19:45.642
- and I could run get you if they hetted up.
- Assuming the unlikely need.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.063
All right.

20:00.616 --> 20:03.368
That's how you have
to fucking deal with him.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.373
(moans)

20:08.541 --> 20:10.584
Oh, cocksucker.

20:10.751 --> 20:13.044
Um...

20:13.212 --> 20:15.213
how are you doing, Ellsworth?

20:16.716 --> 20:19.134
What the fuck did you hit me for?

20:19.302 --> 20:21.177
Did you realize that was me?

20:21.345 --> 20:24.431
You think I'm asking
out of general suspicion?

20:24.599 --> 20:27.726
All right, I'll, uh,
I'll tell you what happened.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.896
Fill you in on the full
fucking circumstance.

20:32.398 --> 20:35.150
Now, uh...

20:35.318 --> 20:39.237
(sighs) Mrs. Ellsworth
is completely safe.

20:39.405 --> 20:43.909
Calm down or I will hit you over the fucking
head again, maybe use more of them spirits

20:44.076 --> 20:47.454
- under your goddamn nose.
- What happened?

20:47.622 --> 20:49.831
Well...

20:49.999 --> 20:54.210
there was some completely-no-fucking-
damage-done gunfire

20:54.378 --> 20:56.379
taken at Mrs. Ellsworth fore and aft.

20:56.547 --> 20:59.215
- But she couldn't be no better.
- I'll kill that cocksucker.

20:59.383 --> 21:01.843
You get out of my way
or I'll kill you fucking first.

21:02.011 --> 21:04.888
Fruitless struggle, Ellsworth,
and stupid goddamn thinking.

21:05.056 --> 21:07.557
Why would they take shots
at Mrs. Ellsworth fore and aft

21:07.725 --> 21:09.684
when they could have just
blowed her fucking head off?

21:09.852 --> 21:13.021
- Goddamn it.
- Calm down and think about it!

21:14.523 --> 21:17.692
They took shots at her fore and aft
so that you would come running,

21:17.860 --> 21:20.654
so they could do to you what they could
have done to her but they didn't.

21:20.821 --> 21:22.656
And to Bullock too, maybe.

21:22.823 --> 21:26.242
So do you see how goddamned
irresponsible it would have been of me

21:26.410 --> 21:29.454
to allow you full fucking
conscious movement?

21:29.622 --> 21:31.331
Do you see?

21:33.334 --> 21:35.293
Now...

21:35.461 --> 21:38.129
I'm gonna cut loose them throttles,

21:38.297 --> 21:41.007
but you best not make me regret it.

21:41.175 --> 21:43.468
Them shots were meant

21:43.636 --> 21:46.304
for maybe rethinking
your tenure here, huh?

21:46.472 --> 21:48.348
Maybe too, in the aftermath,

21:48.516 --> 21:50.850
the shots' author'd designed

21:51.018 --> 21:54.312
Mr. Ellsworth would be moved
to take steps, or Sheriff Bullock would,

21:54.480 --> 21:56.606
that'd justify a violent answer.

21:56.774 --> 21:59.651
The author being Mr. Hearst.

21:59.819 --> 22:03.530
Him, or him having made cause
with your first husband's family,

22:03.698 --> 22:07.033
- Pinkertons presiding over the vows.
- (shaky exhale)

22:07.201 --> 22:09.661
We've wired Bullock to counsel restraint.

22:09.829 --> 22:12.706
We've Ellsworth
trussed up downstairs.

22:12.873 --> 22:16.209
Little in the past
commends me to your trust.

22:16.377 --> 22:21.006
I'd ask you, accepting the premise
that you were bait, not quarry,

22:21.173 --> 22:23.341
complete your walk to the bank.

22:24.552 --> 22:26.970
Get that fucking angler fulminating,

22:27.138 --> 22:29.848
tangling his fucking tackle
and the fucking like.

22:30.016 --> 22:32.100
- Mr. Swearengen.
- Sorry.

22:34.645 --> 22:36.563
(sighs)

23:09.055 --> 23:10.847
I'm quite all right.

23:12.016 --> 23:14.142
I thank God for it.

23:14.310 --> 23:16.478
And I'd be glad
to keep you company

23:16.645 --> 23:18.480
the rest of your day.

23:18.647 --> 23:23.068
I'd be glad if you'd join me at the bank
in a few minutes' time,

23:23.235 --> 23:25.570
having made my way
to the bank alone.

23:25.738 --> 23:28.490
Why in heaven's name
would you want to do that?

23:28.657 --> 23:30.909
To demonstrate

23:31.077 --> 23:33.078
his tactic's failure

23:33.245 --> 23:36.247
and to bid defiance
to him who shot at me.

23:36.415 --> 23:40.919
I got an idea who had you shot at.
Wouldn't mind killing him, even if I'm wrong.

23:41.087 --> 23:44.547
If the shots meant not to harm me
but to provoke certain others,

23:44.715 --> 23:48.510
wouldn't attempting that be playing
into our adversary's strategy?

23:48.677 --> 23:52.472
If it ends with one between Hearst's eyes,
let me play to his strategy and welcome.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.018
I hope instead
you'd have dinner tonight

23:57.186 --> 24:00.563
with Sofia and me,
all of us having passed

24:00.731 --> 24:03.149
the interval uneventfully.

24:05.820 --> 24:08.279
In any case,

24:08.447 --> 24:11.366
please accede to my walking
to the bank alone.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.520
I'd not have you step

24:40.688 --> 24:43.565
one more foot forward, Ellsworth.

24:43.732 --> 24:46.442
As I fucking understand.

25:53.302 --> 25:55.261
(pen scratching)

26:01.393 --> 26:03.519
For Mr. Swearengen.

26:05.147 --> 26:08.608
Last man took a note for you
to Swearengen wound up dead.

26:08.776 --> 26:13.363
The man you refer to knew the note
he bore might bring about that outcome.

26:13.530 --> 26:16.282
This note's import's more innocuous.

26:16.450 --> 26:19.077
- Will it make you less afraid to read it?
- I ain't afraid.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.162
I guess I made a poor joke.

26:21.330 --> 26:23.164
- You do read.
- Sure, sure I do.

26:23.332 --> 26:24.916
Read the note then.

26:31.507 --> 26:34.092
- It's good.
- Out loud, so I know you can.

26:34.260 --> 26:37.345
- I made a poor joke--
- Out loud, to prove you are lettered

26:37.513 --> 26:40.848
and not a liar unfit for my employ!

26:45.813 --> 26:49.315
"Thanks from all for your rescue
of Mrs. Ellsworth.

26:49.483 --> 26:52.151
Who could have shot at her?

26:52.319 --> 26:54.112
Do you wish her guarded

26:54.280 --> 26:57.448
at the bank with the sheriff away?

26:57.616 --> 27:01.077
I saw you let her walk alone.

27:01.245 --> 27:03.288
Answer via bearer."

27:05.624 --> 27:08.835
You don't read easily, do you?

27:15.676 --> 27:19.929
Why don't you come to my office
while I compose my reply?

27:30.441 --> 27:32.608
I'd have asked Jewel ask her,

27:32.776 --> 27:34.610
if I thought to ask,

27:34.778 --> 27:38.573
- if I'd foreseen in time.
- You'd have only put Jewel in a position.

27:38.741 --> 27:42.118
She talks to Trixie-- the bank woman.
Why wouldn't she talk to us?

27:42.286 --> 27:45.538
'Cause she has something to say to Trixie.
We'd just be asking conversation

27:45.706 --> 27:47.540
that she wouldn't know
where to begin with.

27:47.708 --> 27:51.210
Philadelphia's where she's from.
It's what we could've had as a subject.

27:51.378 --> 27:53.212
Got beautiful gracious manners there.

27:53.380 --> 27:56.049
Philadelphia, its many
gracious attractions.

27:56.216 --> 27:57.967
Her dress, her comportment.

27:58.135 --> 28:00.094
She'd have fucking talked to us.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.599
May we speak?

28:06.685 --> 28:09.395
You stand in the hallway
addressing me in my room.

28:09.563 --> 28:11.939
Yes.

28:23.911 --> 28:26.537
The girl who danced last evening,

28:26.705 --> 28:28.998
vagabond sort, hodgepodge costume--

28:29.166 --> 28:31.709
- I know who you mean.
- She'll be staying in the theater,

28:31.877 --> 28:34.712
possibly joining the troupe.

28:34.880 --> 28:37.924
Knowing precious little at all events,

28:38.092 --> 28:42.595
of the course now charting
I know absolutely nothing at all.

28:42.763 --> 28:46.224
- You seem to know what it means for us.
- Knowing you, I suppose I do,

28:46.392 --> 28:50.311
swearing I've laid
no carnal hand to her.

28:50.479 --> 28:53.398
What does installing her accomplish
acknowledging me could not?

28:53.565 --> 28:56.401
Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ.

28:56.568 --> 29:01.114
That I'm old,
that I've lost my belly for sham.

29:03.367 --> 29:06.077
Every drawing
I made in this sketchbook,

29:06.245 --> 29:11.124
every one I've dreamed of painting from,
near a home where we'd live.

29:11.291 --> 29:13.501
Say at least

29:13.669 --> 29:15.670
I never asked it of you.

29:15.838 --> 29:17.630
You'd have me say that

29:17.798 --> 29:19.757
on the day you ask it
of someone else?

29:22.428 --> 29:24.262
Shall I have these?

29:24.430 --> 29:26.931
No.

29:27.099 --> 29:30.893
Paint every fucking one, Mary.

29:43.490 --> 29:45.616
How well did you know the other guy?

29:45.784 --> 29:49.620
- Who would that be?
- That my man Dority killed-- the captain.

29:49.788 --> 29:52.915
We served in the 69th in New York.

29:53.083 --> 29:56.252
- Was that a Mick regiment?
- Mm-hmm.

29:56.420 --> 29:59.005
- What were you doing?
- Cutting throats.

29:59.173 --> 30:02.008
I was asking whose flag
you were under.

30:02.176 --> 30:05.136
The famous Cocksuckers Brigade.

30:05.304 --> 30:06.804
Is that so?

30:06.972 --> 30:09.140
Command of
the All-Whore Detachment.

30:12.478 --> 30:13.895
Distress you

30:14.062 --> 30:16.314
when my man downed your friend?

30:16.482 --> 30:19.317
Let me tell you something,
Mr. Swearengen:

30:19.485 --> 30:22.153
You don't scare me,
and you don't fucking know

30:22.321 --> 30:24.822
what happened
with the 69th New York.

30:24.990 --> 30:26.824
I will tell you this:

30:26.992 --> 30:30.036
I didn't like what
happened to Joe Turner.

30:31.205 --> 30:35.041
Mr. Hearst came to him
and said, "Make it last,

30:35.209 --> 30:37.835
even if you gain the upper hand
and can kill him."

30:38.003 --> 30:40.755
And I think that was
halfway selfish of Mr. Hearst,

30:40.923 --> 30:43.508
whereas Joe could have
killed your man and didn't,

30:43.675 --> 30:45.551
and look how it wound up.

30:45.719 --> 30:47.678
But that's as much I feel like saying,

30:47.846 --> 30:49.889
and that's neither here
nor fucking there.

30:56.563 --> 30:59.190
Fair enough.

31:02.194 --> 31:03.861
All right then.

31:04.029 --> 31:05.488
All right.

31:05.656 --> 31:07.532
But I'll tell you this:

31:07.699 --> 31:11.369
you don't seem halfway like such
a halfway bad fucking person.

31:15.499 --> 31:18.209
So should I tell Mr. Hearst
that there's no messa--

31:18.377 --> 31:20.419
(grunts)

31:20.587 --> 31:24.173
- So you'd shoot at a fucking woman?
- (groaning)

31:25.884 --> 31:29.929
Beat that poor newspaper bastard?
Scare that Chinese with your fucking horses?

31:33.267 --> 31:34.892
How many ribs you think you broke?

31:35.060 --> 31:38.062
Aw, I feel like I broke
two or three ribs.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.565
I'm talking about
that newspaperman's ribs,

31:40.732 --> 31:42.984
- you fucking cunt.
- (groans)

31:55.622 --> 31:57.748
- (knocks)
- Con: I prayed it would pass!

31:57.916 --> 32:02.336
But it's a constant
fucking sore spot and throb.

32:10.971 --> 32:13.097
"You are a constant vision before me,

32:13.265 --> 32:16.100
you and your fabulous bosoms.

32:16.268 --> 32:19.854
I beg you, release your man stallion

32:20.022 --> 32:21.981
from his he-stable

32:22.149 --> 32:24.233
for another gallop round the ring."

32:24.401 --> 32:26.319
Not today, Con.

32:27.821 --> 32:30.489
- Tomorrow?
- Come back tomorrow.

32:30.657 --> 32:33.117
- Any particular time?
- Late in the day.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.453
Perfect! We'll be waiting.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.789
Barrett:
Listen to me, listen to me,

32:38.957 --> 32:41.792
and I'll tell you one fucking thing.
Do you hear me?

32:41.960 --> 32:43.628
I don't hear nothing.

32:43.795 --> 32:46.380
I'm telling you that I'm gonna
tell you one fucking thing.

32:46.548 --> 32:48.966
- All right.
- Do you hear me?

32:49.134 --> 32:51.552
What the fuck?
I'm not fucking deaf.

32:51.720 --> 32:55.348
I wanna... I wanna know
that I'm gonna be fucking heard,

32:55.515 --> 32:58.851
that what I have to
fucking say will matter,

32:59.019 --> 33:01.979
will have some result.

33:02.147 --> 33:04.607
(panting)
'Cause if not...

33:06.526 --> 33:08.903
then what's the fucking point?

33:10.989 --> 33:12.823
All right...

33:12.991 --> 33:15.159
then I'm not gonna
say fucking anything.

33:15.327 --> 33:17.036
What do you think of that?

33:17.204 --> 33:18.996
(gasping, choking)

33:21.166 --> 33:24.543
He sent for more guns.

33:24.711 --> 33:27.046
He wired for more Pinkertons.

33:27.214 --> 33:30.508
They're on the way
and I told you that.

33:32.386 --> 33:34.387
If he finds out I told you--

33:34.554 --> 33:37.390
- Don't worry.
- You won't tell him?

33:37.557 --> 33:40.309
(sobs)

33:41.311 --> 33:44.021
Cy: You might want
to close the fucking door.

33:52.280 --> 33:53.864
Who the fuck are you?

33:54.032 --> 33:56.701
Janine that's Sara's
friend from Cincinnati.

33:56.868 --> 34:00.579
Hmm.

34:00.747 --> 34:02.873
That's a stupid name for a whore.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.501
Makes the tricks
feel like they're stammerers--

34:05.669 --> 34:08.504
"Ja-ni-ni-nine-nine-nine,"
like they're in the fucking Alps.

34:08.672 --> 34:10.547
You can call me whatever you want.

34:10.716 --> 34:13.551
Well, let's call you Stupid

34:13.719 --> 34:17.012
until we can think
of something better.

34:18.931 --> 34:22.268
You miss Cincinnati,
Janine-nine-nine-nine-nine?

34:22.436 --> 34:25.396
Are you afraid of fucking Deadwood?

34:25.563 --> 34:27.398
Do you miss your mom and dad?

34:27.565 --> 34:30.443
Do you have one of each?

34:30.610 --> 34:33.070
Are they aboveground,
do you know?

34:33.237 --> 34:36.239
Oh...

34:36.408 --> 34:38.409
do I see the beginnings of a tear

34:38.577 --> 34:40.703
in the corner of your left eye?

34:40.871 --> 34:44.248
- I'm all right.
- For the purposes of our discussion...

34:45.833 --> 34:48.043
as much as anyone cares,
is my meaning.

34:48.210 --> 34:50.588
(Cy puts down glass)

34:50.755 --> 34:52.882
All right, Stupid.

34:53.049 --> 34:56.092
Con'll advance you $5 against
your first evening's fucking.

34:56.261 --> 34:58.429
Don't do no dope with Leon.

34:58.597 --> 35:01.098
Welcome to the Bella Union.

35:14.488 --> 35:16.947
Close the fucking door, Stupid!

35:18.325 --> 35:20.910
(whining)
He's got 25 more guns coming,

35:21.077 --> 35:23.537
25 Pinkertons.

35:23.705 --> 35:25.915
When they get here,
he's gonna move on the camp.

35:26.082 --> 35:28.709
Before the elections?

35:28.877 --> 35:30.795
25 Pinkertons already.

35:30.962 --> 35:33.088
He has 25 on the way,

35:33.256 --> 35:35.090
and 100 at his operation.

35:35.258 --> 35:38.803
Al: Before or after the elections?

35:38.970 --> 35:40.846
I don't know.
I don't know.

35:41.014 --> 35:43.307
Please don't hurt me.

35:43.475 --> 35:46.477
That's all I fucking know.

35:51.775 --> 35:54.693
Come on, come on.
Don't give up hope.

36:16.132 --> 36:18.509
Passing a little wind.

36:25.475 --> 36:27.226
(sighs)

36:27.394 --> 36:30.187
(sobs)

36:37.529 --> 36:40.573
- Yes.
- (pounds on door)

36:40.740 --> 36:42.908
Yes, come in.

36:47.372 --> 36:49.248
Mr. Hearst.

36:49.416 --> 36:51.834
Have you enjoyed
yourself today, Farnum?

36:52.002 --> 36:55.671
For reasons I find elusive,
the day has quite displeased me.

36:55.839 --> 36:58.048
What will help you find
a name for your feelings?

36:58.216 --> 37:01.468
Shall we cut open your belly for you
to wrap your guts around a pole?

37:01.636 --> 37:04.221
- You seem distraught.
- I am not!

37:04.389 --> 37:06.599
I await an outcome!

37:06.766 --> 37:09.685
- And the readying for it wearies me.
- Oh, dear.

37:09.853 --> 37:12.354
Have you smelt human
flesh on the spit?

37:12.522 --> 37:14.440
- How would I have?
- I know the smell.

37:14.608 --> 37:16.400
You have been to and fro
in the world.

37:16.568 --> 37:19.695
It pleased me to find out.

37:19.863 --> 37:22.072
Well then, fine.

37:24.868 --> 37:28.829
- Don't you want to wipe that off?
- No?

37:32.375 --> 37:34.877
You would regret my coming back

37:35.045 --> 37:38.714
and finding that you
had cleaned your face.

37:38.882 --> 37:41.425
I understand.

37:59.152 --> 38:01.278
Dan, Johnny.

38:03.114 --> 38:04.573
(door slams)

38:04.741 --> 38:07.326
He doesn't want you
to dirty your hands.

38:09.746 --> 38:11.580
Al: All that shouting--

38:11.748 --> 38:14.708
"You're a cunt for hire
to shoot at women" and the like--

38:14.876 --> 38:17.461
just trying to frighten you a little,

38:17.629 --> 38:19.964
encouraging you to chat.

38:20.131 --> 38:23.217
Who amongst us hasn't wanted to shoot
at women once or twice, hmm?

38:26.346 --> 38:29.014
Anything you want to say else
before I let you rest,

38:29.182 --> 38:32.267
knowing I don't sit
upon you in judgment?

38:38.400 --> 38:40.442
(gagging)

38:45.448 --> 38:47.449
(gurgling)

38:52.998 --> 38:55.874
Did he come to you
by a different path, Mr. Hearst?

38:56.042 --> 38:58.460
Did he somehow circumnavigate

38:58.628 --> 39:01.005
to bring my reply to you
without me seeing?

39:01.172 --> 39:02.840
What are you talking about?

39:03.008 --> 39:05.926
Your man went out the back
of my fucking place,

39:06.094 --> 39:09.346
and I've been hoping against hope
for reasons beyond my understanding

39:09.514 --> 39:14.018
- that it was to return to you unseen by me.
- He has not returned.

39:14.185 --> 39:17.604
Jesus Christ, maybe he was
telling the truth--

39:17.772 --> 39:20.024
that he was lighting out
for fucking Bismarck.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.860
Jesus Christ Almighty!

39:23.028 --> 39:26.113
Did you and he have some
kind of misunderstanding, sir,

39:26.281 --> 39:30.284
that he took for pretext the letter's
delivery to make his fucking escape?

39:30.452 --> 39:32.578
Well, then I say, Mr. Hearst,

39:32.746 --> 39:35.664
you are well the fuck rid
of that cocksucker,

39:35.832 --> 39:39.376
that he'd show so little loyalty
or sense of responsibility

39:39.544 --> 39:41.712
to the delivery of communications.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.548
Jesus Christ Almighty,
where do we find good help?

39:44.716 --> 39:47.009
Oh, and in reply to your letter, sir,

39:47.177 --> 39:50.554
my opinion only, she don't need
no escort or guarding,

39:50.722 --> 39:53.807
but it's the kind of generous inquiry
I'd expect you to make.

39:53.975 --> 39:56.393
How's your back, Mr. Hearst?

39:57.604 --> 40:00.230
How's the fucking back there, pal?

40:03.735 --> 40:05.611
Wu.

40:05.779 --> 40:08.489
Longest a rug's lasted so far.

40:12.077 --> 40:13.452
Seth: Whoa.

40:15.080 --> 40:17.039
Whoa.
What's going on, Charlie?

40:21.211 --> 40:24.088
- Some fucking day.
- It was a good day.

40:24.255 --> 40:28.509
I only wish some of Hearst's pistoleros
had come to test our mettle.

40:28.676 --> 40:32.221
Once my Derringer was empty,
you would have been firing for both of us.

40:32.388 --> 40:36.100
And equal to the task,
believe you fucking me.

40:36.267 --> 40:40.229
Not that I wouldn't have regretted
them children having to witness.

40:44.734 --> 40:47.945
- Can I tell you something?
- Okay.

40:48.113 --> 40:50.572
Some stupid fucking thing.

40:50.740 --> 40:52.616
Stupid fucking dream I had.

40:52.784 --> 40:54.952
Okay.

40:55.120 --> 40:56.954
I dreamed last night

40:57.122 --> 41:00.415
that I was clamoring up
a fucking creek bank,

41:00.583 --> 41:02.960
which is often required of a drunk.

41:03.128 --> 41:06.463
It was dark and I couldn't
tell where I was

41:06.631 --> 41:08.215
till I cleared the bank

41:08.383 --> 41:12.010
and come face to face
with Charlie Utter's ugly mug.

41:12.178 --> 41:15.848
Now Charlie's, as usual,
on the lookout for Bill

41:16.015 --> 41:17.850
that's, as usual too,

41:18.017 --> 41:21.353
losing at poker inside
the joint we're outside of.

41:21.521 --> 41:24.231
"Where are we, Charlie?"
This could be any fucking place

41:24.399 --> 41:29.278
the last number of years.
And he said, "Jane, don't you know

41:29.445 --> 41:32.322
this is the No. 10 Saloon
here in the camp

41:32.490 --> 41:35.659
where Bill's gonna
fucking get killed soon?"

41:35.827 --> 41:38.328
"Jesus Chri-- how do you know,
Charlie?" I asked him.

41:38.496 --> 41:41.623
He said, "Don't you know,"

41:41.791 --> 41:44.710
he says, "at some point
we know these fucking things?

41:44.878 --> 41:46.753
Don't you know

41:46.921 --> 41:50.716
the world says its
fucking name to us?"

41:51.759 --> 41:53.218
"What the fuck?

41:53.386 --> 41:56.680
What the fuck do I have
to dream about this for,"

41:56.848 --> 41:59.975
I say to Charlie,
"Wasn't I miserable enough?"

42:00.143 --> 42:03.270
"Jane," fucking Charlie says to me,
"don't you know this is the night

42:03.438 --> 42:06.690
you couldn't look out for that little girl
when you was at Cochran's,

42:06.858 --> 42:09.109
and Swearengen come in
and scared you

42:09.277 --> 42:12.070
and you went down
to the creek to weep?

42:12.238 --> 42:14.489
That's where the fuck
you're coming from.

42:14.657 --> 42:16.825
And don't you know," he says,

42:16.993 --> 42:20.329
"this is the night you spirit
that child from Cochran's

42:20.496 --> 42:23.207
into where our stock
was outside of camp,

42:23.374 --> 42:26.376
and we watched out on that little girl

42:26.544 --> 42:29.713
and sung to her, and you,

42:29.881 --> 42:32.382
with the presence
of mind to continue

42:32.550 --> 42:35.761
the fucking round
when I was too fucking stupid?

42:35.929 --> 42:38.722
And you said-- you would...
♪ Row row row ♪

42:38.890 --> 42:41.183
and I said...
♪ Row row row your boat ♪

42:41.351 --> 42:43.060
and we had this..."

42:46.105 --> 42:49.900
"Now," Charlie says to me,

42:50.068 --> 42:51.902
"don't you understand

42:52.070 --> 42:54.029
what I'm trying to tell you?

42:54.197 --> 42:57.574
Any evenings in your life
you made mistakes,

42:57.742 --> 43:00.535
remember where even evenings

43:00.703 --> 43:02.621
you was as most ashamed

43:02.789 --> 43:05.207
as you ever thought
you could ever be

43:05.375 --> 43:07.292
are able to wind up,

43:07.460 --> 43:09.878
and don't fucking only
remember the middle

43:10.046 --> 43:12.005
of the fucking dream!"

43:16.010 --> 43:19.263
If I wonder why
I dreamed that dream...

43:21.015 --> 43:23.850
yesterday you sent Mose to find me

43:24.018 --> 43:26.353
and I was nearly
dead-drowned drunk

43:26.521 --> 43:29.064
and Mose made me get up

43:29.232 --> 43:32.442
and you and me walked
them kids to school

43:32.610 --> 43:36.405
and before I went to sleep

43:36.572 --> 43:38.156
you kissed me.

43:38.324 --> 43:42.619
After Tolliver come
and you found Mose to help me.

43:42.787 --> 43:45.455
And Charlie
to help me find that little girl

43:45.623 --> 43:48.417
the very night I got scared and run

43:48.584 --> 43:50.419
and the both of us

43:50.586 --> 43:52.629
sung a round to her,

43:52.797 --> 43:55.424
and then you went ahead
and kissed me.

44:24.996 --> 44:28.832
To spare you surprise on our advent
at the theater in the morning,

44:29.000 --> 44:30.667
I tell you here and now

44:30.835 --> 44:34.921
that you will
come upon a certain person...

44:36.466 --> 44:39.926
a woman who will be joining us.

44:40.094 --> 44:42.346
Who is she?
Where has she performed?

44:42.513 --> 44:44.681
I believe her name is Josiane.

44:44.849 --> 44:48.268
- She is French?
- I believe.

44:48.436 --> 44:51.355
- I know she's spent time in Paris.
- Where has she performed?

44:51.522 --> 44:54.941
She has performed nowhere
that we would have knowledge of,

44:55.109 --> 44:56.902
- to my knowledge.
- Josiane?

44:57.070 --> 44:58.945
- Yes.
- Living at the theater?

44:59.113 --> 45:02.949
- Temporarily.
- To be installed thereafter where?

45:03.117 --> 45:07.329
Shut up! I won't have it,
this getting off on the wrong foot.

45:07.497 --> 45:11.041
So you commit us to a long relation
with Josiane.

45:11.209 --> 45:14.544
You will find her at the goddamn theater
in the morning is what I mean!

45:14.712 --> 45:18.090
And I won't have this
goddamn wrong-footedness.

45:18.257 --> 45:21.385
Thank you, Richardson.

45:21.552 --> 45:23.553
Mean-spirited is what I mean,

45:23.721 --> 45:25.722
a lack of generosity,

45:25.890 --> 45:27.349
selfishness.

45:27.517 --> 45:29.893
Don't you think it all has an effect...

45:34.607 --> 45:37.484
on your performance?

45:37.652 --> 45:40.529
Does this performance seem genuine?

46:05.930 --> 46:09.349
Situation being fluid and not likely
to get less so for a while,

46:09.517 --> 46:11.476
I went ahead and reordered hames.

46:15.064 --> 46:17.858
Steve, made imbecile
by that horse's hoof,

46:18.025 --> 46:19.693
he couldn't authorize it.

46:19.861 --> 46:23.697
But I went ahead and assumed
whoever finally takes the livery over

46:23.865 --> 46:27.784
might want a restock of hames.
So I ordered 'em.

46:37.920 --> 46:40.630
