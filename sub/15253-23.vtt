WEBVTT

00:01.988 --> 00:03.187
Elle, you know

00:03.188 --> 00:04.088
that Intersect project
that Dad was working on?

00:04.155 --> 00:05.322
I've been trying

00:05.390 --> 00:06.957
to figure it out for weeks.
It's in my head.

00:07.025 --> 00:08.976
<i>From what I can piece
together from his files,</i>

00:09.044 --> 00:10.277
Dad used this program

00:10.345 --> 00:12.830
<i>to input a new identity
into an operative.</i>

00:12.897 --> 00:14.932
<i>But once he went undercover,
something went wrong.</i>

00:14.999 --> 00:17.568
<i>The program took over.
He became his cover identity.</i>

00:17.635 --> 00:18.936
Agent X is Alexei Volkoff?

00:19.003 --> 00:20.904
I have a company to run
and I need leverage to run it.

00:20.972 --> 00:22.840
<i>And Norseman's the most
dangerous weapon in the world.</i>

00:22.907 --> 00:24.541
Rebuild the device
as quickly as possible.

00:24.609 --> 00:27.244
That way, no one can touch me...
ever.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:40.475 --> 00:42.593
Right this way, Miss Volkoff.

00:42.660 --> 00:45.379
Again, I'm sorry it's taken so
long to reassemble The Norseman,

00:45.463 --> 00:47.364
but we've finally done it.

00:47.415 --> 00:48.565
I should hope so.

00:48.633 --> 00:50.734
Miss Volkoff's patience
has worn very thin.

00:50.802 --> 00:52.469
Whoever's been trying
to sabotage the operation

00:52.537 --> 00:54.138
certainly won't find
their way down here.

01:07.185 --> 01:08.552
Let me, Vivian.

01:12.390 --> 01:15.893
If-if I may ask, who is the
first subject going to be?

01:21.533 --> 01:23.100
Ow!

01:23.168 --> 01:24.835
God! Ow!

01:24.903 --> 01:27.204
God! That noise!

01:30.074 --> 01:32.576
Amazing!

01:32.644 --> 01:34.077
It located the correct DNA.

01:34.145 --> 01:35.479
It works!
You know, dear,

01:35.547 --> 01:37.748
you really should try to do some
of this dirty work yourself.

01:37.816 --> 01:39.483
You know, the head
of Volkoff Industries

01:39.551 --> 01:41.451
needs a public face

01:41.519 --> 01:43.854
that spreads fear...
and respect.

01:43.922 --> 01:46.089
Thank you.

01:46.157 --> 01:47.925
I appreciate your guidance.

01:47.992 --> 01:49.493
Of course, dear.

01:49.561 --> 01:50.828
After you.

02:01.606 --> 02:04.174
I think the proper word
right now would be "freeze."

02:04.242 --> 02:05.609
Hello, Riley.

02:05.677 --> 02:07.044
Vivian,

02:07.111 --> 02:09.279
meet the woman who betrayed...
your father

02:09.347 --> 02:11.048
for 20 years.

02:11.115 --> 02:14.051
Frost, welcome back!

02:23.895 --> 02:25.495
Good morning.

02:26.831 --> 02:28.465
You know what we
have to do today?

02:28.533 --> 02:31.368
Mmm.

02:31.436 --> 02:33.370
Hunt someone?
No.

02:33.438 --> 02:36.023
Blow something up?
No, again.

02:36.107 --> 02:38.475
M-mm. Crawl through...

02:38.543 --> 02:41.812
sewers or... rat holes

02:41.880 --> 02:45.249
or underground lairs filled
with sewage and/or rats?

02:45.316 --> 02:48.085
No, no, and no.

02:48.152 --> 02:51.188
Today we have a day
off from the CIA.

02:51.256 --> 02:54.191
Today is about you and
me and our wedding.

02:54.259 --> 02:57.044
God, that's good.

02:58.379 --> 02:59.496
Mmm.

03:06.337 --> 03:09.005
I'm sorry my bridesmaids
couldn't help out more.

03:09.057 --> 03:11.441
Staging that coup is taking
longer than expected.

03:11.509 --> 03:13.510
No. That's totally
understandable.

03:13.578 --> 03:15.529
I mean, you know,
coups take time.

03:15.613 --> 03:18.615
Anyway, uh, Awesome
and Morgan and Ellie

03:18.683 --> 03:21.368
have basically taken over
every chore we had, so...

03:21.452 --> 03:22.686
Your family is so sweet.

03:22.754 --> 03:24.288
They're bending over backwards

03:24.355 --> 03:26.089
to protect us from
anything that's stressful.

03:26.157 --> 03:27.524
I know.

03:27.592 --> 03:29.726
Of course there is that one
little thing I have to do

03:29.794 --> 03:31.245
that you don't get
to know about,

03:31.329 --> 03:33.430
because I am adorable.

03:33.498 --> 03:35.365
Yes, you are.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.718
Everything is perfect.
Nothing can go wrong.

03:37.802 --> 03:40.237
Oh, Sarah, you didn't.

03:42.724 --> 03:44.007
Chuck!

03:44.058 --> 03:45.776
What? Why would you
say that?

03:45.843 --> 03:47.010
Do you not watch movies?

03:47.061 --> 03:48.145
<i>Well, I finally
watched Mannequin.</i>

03:48.212 --> 03:49.879
Oh, yeah?
Did you like it?

03:49.931 --> 03:51.982
Not good. Little help.

03:52.049 --> 03:53.483
Oh, my God!

03:53.551 --> 03:54.651
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

03:54.719 --> 03:55.986
Honey, get him down.
I got him.

03:56.053 --> 03:57.571
- Yo!
- Okay, bud.

03:57.655 --> 03:59.489
Uh, just go limp;

03:59.557 --> 04:01.925
Fall into my arms. Go limp!
You go limp. Chuck!

04:03.494 --> 04:04.728
Good morning. Everything...

04:04.779 --> 04:05.895
Everything fine here.

04:05.947 --> 04:06.896
Nothing to worry about.

04:06.948 --> 04:09.082
Chuck! Do something!

04:09.167 --> 04:11.118
All right, everybody calm down.
I got this.

04:14.038 --> 04:15.905
Whoo!

04:23.348 --> 04:24.881
All right, here we go. Here.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.249
Here we go.

04:26.301 --> 04:28.218
You all right?
Yeah, all good.

04:28.269 --> 04:29.553
Your face is a little flush.

04:29.620 --> 04:31.888
Well, so...
Coming down!

04:35.893 --> 04:37.761
Awesome!
Impressive, isn't it?

04:37.812 --> 04:39.946
You seriously
don't do any core work?

04:40.031 --> 04:41.615
Oh, just sitting up
to reach the remote.

04:41.699 --> 04:43.367
Bitchin', dude.
Right?

04:43.434 --> 04:44.935
Oh, okay? You know what?

04:45.003 --> 04:46.603
Chuck, Sarah, that was great,
but seriously,

04:46.654 --> 04:47.937
back inside.
I don't want you doing

04:47.989 --> 04:50.540
any work today. Go do
something romantic, okay?

04:50.608 --> 04:53.610
Right. Romantic, got it.
Thank you.

04:54.996 --> 04:56.780
Morgan?
Yes, ma'am.

04:56.831 --> 04:58.131
We have more twinkle lights,

04:58.216 --> 04:59.549
don't we?
Yes, ma'am.

04:59.617 --> 05:00.884
Because this place
has to be magical.

05:00.951 --> 05:04.120
Yes, ma'am. Magical! Morgan...

05:04.172 --> 05:05.839
Yes, ma'am.

05:05.923 --> 05:07.307
Honey, you're scaring me.

05:08.426 --> 05:09.959
Just keep it moving.

05:11.963 --> 05:13.013
I hear you, honey. I'll...

05:13.097 --> 05:14.064
I'll take care of it, I promise.

05:14.131 --> 05:15.365
Thank you, Dad.

05:16.901 --> 05:17.968
Guys, guys, I'm so sorry.

05:18.036 --> 05:19.503
But, uh, I need a
little help here.

05:19.570 --> 05:22.639
I just told Ellie that I have
all these extra twinkle lights,

05:22.690 --> 05:24.141
And I don't have
actual twinkle lights,

05:24.208 --> 05:25.975
and she could yell at me.

05:26.027 --> 05:28.278
Oh, do you want me to just
go out and get some for you?

05:28.329 --> 05:30.146
- Can you do that?
- Yeah. - Really?

05:30.198 --> 05:32.332
- Of course. You're the best.
- You are wonderful. Come here.

05:32.417 --> 05:33.784
And did I tell you...

05:33.835 --> 05:36.253
how very excited I am
to have you

05:36.320 --> 05:38.321
as my very, very hot date
to Chuck's wedding?

05:38.389 --> 05:40.490
See, I was figuring when this day
came, I would be taking my mother.

05:40.558 --> 05:43.159
Yes, so... Well, your mom's
gonna have to get her own date,

05:43.211 --> 05:44.711
because you are mine.
Oh.

05:50.601 --> 05:53.503
Castle. Oh, no.

05:53.571 --> 05:55.672
"Oh, no," what?

05:55.740 --> 05:59.042
What? Wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-what?
Do we have a mission? Today?

05:59.110 --> 06:02.362
I have a mission.
Oh.

06:02.447 --> 06:04.448
I'll just tell Ellie she's
gonna have to do without us.

06:04.515 --> 06:06.116
No, no. Not you.

06:08.369 --> 06:10.987
What's that about?

06:16.744 --> 06:19.029
Buon giorno...

06:19.097 --> 06:20.697
No. No. Casey, no way.

06:20.765 --> 06:22.866
We have the week off.

06:22.934 --> 06:23.934
You'd better be here

06:24.001 --> 06:25.235
to talk mimosas or wedding.

06:25.303 --> 06:27.037
I am.

06:27.105 --> 06:29.206
Your mom might not
be able to make it.

06:29.273 --> 06:30.607
Why? What happened?

06:30.675 --> 06:33.610
She's been taken...

07:18.891 --> 07:20.274
Why was she even
working on Volkoff?

07:20.359 --> 07:22.560
That was our case.
She must be trying to protect us.

07:22.628 --> 07:24.562
Taking Vivian off our plate so
we could focus on the wedding.

07:24.630 --> 07:26.781
Yeah, but look how she went in--
no backup, no contingency...

07:26.865 --> 07:29.367
Have you even spoken to her lately?
No. I haven't even gotten a chance

07:29.435 --> 07:30.735
to ask her about my
Dad and Agent X;

07:30.803 --> 07:32.069
find out if she knew about it.

07:32.137 --> 07:33.504
Where is she, Sarah?

07:33.572 --> 07:37.041
Well, this is her
last communiqué.

07:47.085 --> 07:48.352
This is a mine in Colombia.

07:48.420 --> 07:50.188
Lot of bad guy traffic
there for some reason.

07:50.255 --> 07:52.490
Okay, good. So we start there.
It's a quick flight,

07:52.558 --> 07:55.059
- and we'll have your mom back
for the rehearsal dinner. - Sarah...

07:56.161 --> 07:58.029
I need my best man.

07:58.096 --> 07:59.147
You need your best man!

07:59.231 --> 08:00.565
Come on!
Let's go get your mom, dude!

08:00.632 --> 08:02.033
Time to save the day.

08:02.100 --> 08:04.535
No, uh, Morgan, Morgan, uh...
I actually

08:04.603 --> 08:06.204
I need you to save the day

08:06.271 --> 08:08.873
in a different way... by...

08:08.941 --> 08:11.642
creating a very romantic
video montage

08:11.710 --> 08:12.977
of me and Sarah
for our rehearsal dinner.

08:13.045 --> 08:15.079
Oh. Hmm.

08:15.147 --> 08:16.280
Hmm, not quite as Superman
as I'd like,

08:16.348 --> 08:18.382
but, uh, of course, man,
anything you need.

08:18.450 --> 08:20.251
Thank you so much. Um...

08:20.302 --> 08:21.385
Just a little problem...

08:21.453 --> 08:23.454
Sarah doesn't have
any old pictures.

08:23.522 --> 08:25.723
So I was thinking maybe we could
just Photoshop her into some

08:25.791 --> 08:26.958
of the different places
that she's lived,

08:27.025 --> 08:28.009
something kind of cute.

08:28.093 --> 08:29.460
Totally cute. Okay.

08:29.511 --> 08:31.696
I get it. I got it.
I'm on it.

08:31.763 --> 08:33.014
Done. I'm on it.
Thanks, buddy.

08:33.097 --> 08:34.398
Yeah, of course.
My best man.

08:34.466 --> 08:37.184
Means a lot to me. You know...
Yeah.

08:37.269 --> 08:38.568
Best man.
Nah...

08:38.636 --> 08:40.304
You are the best man.
Come on! I am, aren't I.

08:40.355 --> 08:42.440
<i>Jeffrey, our time has come.</i>

08:47.980 --> 08:50.748
Need some footage
of Sarah, do you?

08:50.815 --> 08:52.517
Why?

08:52.584 --> 08:54.051
You don't have any, do you?

08:54.119 --> 08:56.320
We have over 1,250 hours

08:56.371 --> 08:59.373
of Sarah-related footage.

08:59.458 --> 09:03.494
My clients have been exploring
their options as filmmakers

09:03.545 --> 09:04.712
ever since realizing

09:04.796 --> 09:07.198
that Jeffster! may not be as...

09:07.266 --> 09:09.166
lucrative as expected.
No way.

09:09.218 --> 09:11.536
I've had a camera
running for years.

09:11.603 --> 09:13.571
We have voyeur, we have candid,

09:13.639 --> 09:15.556
we have nip slips of Chuck.

09:15.641 --> 09:18.025
Okay, all right, good, great.
Listen, all right...

09:18.110 --> 09:20.344
Cannot express to you

09:20.395 --> 09:22.530
the rage
that is actually building up...

09:22.614 --> 09:24.248
On the other hand...

09:24.316 --> 09:25.917
I really could use that footage

09:25.984 --> 09:27.068
to complete this
present for Chuck,

09:27.152 --> 09:28.819
so...

09:28.887 --> 09:30.922
- May I have this footage?
- Grimes,

09:30.989 --> 09:35.726
I am a montage... artist.

09:35.794 --> 09:38.462
I am gonna need first and...

09:38.530 --> 09:40.882
final cut.
I am

09:40.966 --> 09:42.366
fairly certain it'll
turn out terrible...

09:42.434 --> 09:45.770
I can hear you...
But I do need the footage. So...

09:45.837 --> 09:46.971
You may have first cut,

09:47.038 --> 09:48.639
then he will hand it over to me,

09:48.707 --> 09:50.558
and then I will make it good.

09:50.642 --> 09:53.978
Yes. Uh, my clients
will attach themselves

09:54.046 --> 09:56.898
under those terms.
Agreed.

10:03.822 --> 10:05.239
Casey!

10:05.324 --> 10:06.591
Good news.

10:06.658 --> 10:09.059
Best man chores
are off the plate,

10:09.111 --> 10:10.661
so I am fully avail
for the mission.

10:10.729 --> 10:12.096
Let's go save Chuck's mom!

10:12.164 --> 10:14.398
Howitzer.

10:14.466 --> 10:15.967
All right!

10:16.034 --> 10:17.635
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na,

10:17.703 --> 10:19.537
na, na, na... nah...
I don't know.

10:19.605 --> 10:21.238
<i>I kind of like the ones
that make me look big,</i>

10:21.290 --> 10:22.256
you know?
You're not coming.

10:23.508 --> 10:24.609
Can't believe how
much you worry.

10:24.676 --> 10:25.927
Casey, listen to me.

10:26.011 --> 10:28.296
All the wedding stuff is
going to get taken care of.

10:28.380 --> 10:29.647
Ellie is on it.

10:29.715 --> 10:31.299
And I need to be here
for my team.

10:31.383 --> 10:32.617
You're not part of any team.
I don't see...

10:32.684 --> 10:33.651
How could you say that?

10:33.719 --> 10:35.953
I've have been doing a ton

10:36.021 --> 10:37.755
of really, like,
big-time stuff lately.

10:37.806 --> 10:40.090
You're not coming,
so why don't you just...

10:40.142 --> 10:41.309
focus on your twinkle lights.

10:41.393 --> 10:44.562
My twinkle lights.

10:44.630 --> 10:46.364
Ouch.

11:07.169 --> 11:08.336
Oh, God.

11:08.420 --> 11:09.553
Uh...

11:11.423 --> 11:12.623
Lot of chickens and stray dogs,

11:12.691 --> 11:14.558
and not a lot of top-secret
holding cells.

11:14.626 --> 11:16.978
Where do we even start looking?

11:17.062 --> 11:18.962
How many mines
have security like that?

11:31.243 --> 11:33.778
Let's find out what these guards
are up to, huh?

11:49.394 --> 11:51.178
Hope you boys are hungry.

11:51.263 --> 11:53.130
Looks like there's
two entrances to the mine.

11:53.181 --> 11:57.334
The miners go in one;
guards go in the other.

11:57.386 --> 11:59.070
Bet you Volkoff's
down in that one.

11:59.137 --> 12:01.472
Well, if your mom
is still in the area,

12:01.540 --> 12:03.307
she's probably
being held down there.

12:03.375 --> 12:05.376
All right. What are we
waiting for? Let's do this.

12:17.906 --> 12:19.690
Ugh.

12:19.758 --> 12:21.191
The guards are leaving.

12:21.243 --> 12:23.044
We got to move.
Yeah, well, we can't just

12:23.128 --> 12:24.695
waltz in after them.
Look at the traffic

12:24.746 --> 12:26.497
going in and out.
We might be way outmanned.

12:26.548 --> 12:28.566
I have an idea.
Why don't we leave the table

12:28.633 --> 12:29.734
before this thing attacks us?

12:29.801 --> 12:31.201
Yeah. Good.

12:32.304 --> 12:33.838
<i>Gracias.</i>

12:55.577 --> 12:57.595
Move it along, Chewie.

12:57.662 --> 12:59.229
Chewie?

12:59.281 --> 13:00.748
Why are you calling him Chewie?

13:00.832 --> 13:03.734
He didn't even eat anything
off that disgusting platter.

13:03.785 --> 13:06.253
<i>Honey, it's
a reference to Star...</i>

13:06.338 --> 13:08.506
Oh, I love you.

13:12.711 --> 13:15.262
I got a bad feeling about this.

13:27.594 --> 13:29.161
Prisoner transfer
from Pueblo facility.

13:29.212 --> 13:30.896
Do you have documentation
for that?

13:30.964 --> 13:32.231
It was a verbal.

13:32.299 --> 13:33.833
So if you just tell us
which cell is available,

13:33.900 --> 13:35.167
we'll take our man back there.

13:35.235 --> 13:36.836
I don't know how
you ran things in Pueblo,

13:36.903 --> 13:38.471
but you're not
getting back there

13:38.538 --> 13:40.806
without the proper paperwork.

13:42.476 --> 13:45.211
This is what
happens when you draw your plans

13:45.278 --> 13:46.445
<i>from Star Wars.</i>

13:46.513 --> 13:47.780
Got to get bloody now.

13:47.848 --> 13:49.231
Just hang on.
Hang on a minute.

13:49.316 --> 13:50.583
Hang on.

13:50.650 --> 13:51.584
Uh, excuse me, sir.

13:51.651 --> 13:52.902
Uh, look,

13:52.986 --> 13:55.121
I don't mean to...
I don't mean to bug you,

13:55.188 --> 13:57.089
but can you look
at the cute little number

13:57.157 --> 13:58.290
that came in with me?

13:58.358 --> 13:59.558
Not the large man.

13:59.626 --> 14:00.926
Real pretty one-- blonde.

14:00.994 --> 14:03.462
Girls like that are pretty
few and far between

14:03.530 --> 14:05.381
in Pueblo, if you
know what I mean.

14:05.465 --> 14:08.234
The two of us have kind of had
this will they/won't they,

14:08.301 --> 14:10.302
burgeoning office
romance going.

14:10.370 --> 14:11.504
I'm really trying
to impress her,

14:11.571 --> 14:13.339
so could you help me
out a little bit?

14:14.641 --> 14:15.941
Beat your man.

14:16.009 --> 14:17.810
Sorry?

14:17.878 --> 14:21.514
Once, I snapped a
guy's neck for a girl.

14:21.581 --> 14:23.215
She melted all over me.

14:23.283 --> 14:24.450
Is that right?

14:24.518 --> 14:25.551
I can kind of see that.

14:25.619 --> 14:27.420
Okay. Locking that one away.

14:28.855 --> 14:30.790
Oh, now. Right now.

14:30.857 --> 14:32.224
You want me to do that now.

14:32.275 --> 14:35.461
Okay, yeah. Now would be
the appropriate... time.

14:43.286 --> 14:44.804
Really?

14:44.871 --> 14:46.872
Do you want to die alone?

14:51.762 --> 14:53.345
Okay!

14:53.413 --> 14:55.614
I did that!
Wasn't that sexy?

14:55.682 --> 14:57.316
Uh, so sexy.

14:57.384 --> 14:59.751
Mm.
All right. You two crazy kids

14:59.803 --> 15:01.754
take him back to cell 24.

15:01.822 --> 15:05.024
But, uh, I think this girl's
already been to cell 24.

15:05.092 --> 15:08.127
Oh, she looks like a dirty one.

15:10.564 --> 15:13.365
Oh, I get it.
Yeah, like cell 24. Dirty one.

15:16.153 --> 15:18.103
Hey, that's so sweet.
You defended my honor.

15:18.155 --> 15:19.822
Well, you know, we're getting
married in a week, sweetheart.

15:19.906 --> 15:21.207
Now, let's get rid
of this body, huh?

15:21.274 --> 15:23.876
I'll get rid of it.
You go find your mom.

15:23.943 --> 15:26.846
I'll be right there as soon as
I get this guy's pants off.

15:28.748 --> 15:30.683
Oh, shut up. Move.

15:30.750 --> 15:31.917
Come on. Let's go.

15:33.353 --> 15:34.954
Looks like your mom's
in cell 13.

15:50.604 --> 15:52.638
Mom.
Chuck!

15:52.689 --> 15:54.190
You're about to get married.

15:54.274 --> 15:55.641
What are you doing here?

15:55.709 --> 15:57.193
Yes, exactly-- we're about
to get married, which is why

15:57.277 --> 15:58.494
we're getting you out
of here right now.

15:58.578 --> 15:59.578
Oh, no, honey.

15:59.646 --> 16:01.013
I'm sorry.
I can't leave yet.

16:01.081 --> 16:02.998
But you should go.
I can handle myself.

16:03.083 --> 16:04.517
No offense, Mary, but
that's the attitude

16:04.584 --> 16:06.252
that got you captured
in the first place.

16:06.319 --> 16:09.321
Vivian's team has reassembled
The Norseman down here.

16:09.372 --> 16:11.090
I can't leave without it.

16:11.157 --> 16:13.325
I'll just endure
a couple of rounds of torture,

16:13.376 --> 16:16.762
- and then I'll find a way
to break out and get it. - Uh, no.

16:16.830 --> 16:18.164
We're not leaving you here
to get tortured.

16:18.231 --> 16:19.532
We have a wedding to get you to.

16:19.599 --> 16:20.999
Hey, come on, we got to move.

16:21.051 --> 16:22.551
Let's go.
Sweetheart,

16:22.636 --> 16:24.270
I know the wedding is important,

16:24.337 --> 16:26.572
but so is the nation's safety.

16:26.640 --> 16:28.691
If I leave now,
they will move the weapon

16:28.775 --> 16:29.892
and we'll never get it.

16:29.976 --> 16:31.510
Mary, don't be stubborn.

16:31.578 --> 16:33.512
We're just here to extract you,
not finish a failed mission.

16:33.580 --> 16:36.198
Failed? Stubborn?

16:36.283 --> 16:38.367
Okay, okay, okay. Look, here's the
plan-- I'm gonna go with Casey

16:38.451 --> 16:40.186
to get The Norseman; Sarah,
you're gonna stay with Mom,

16:40.253 --> 16:42.721
make sure she doesn't get tortured.
I don't need backup.

16:42.789 --> 16:44.240
Why can't Casey stay
here with your mom?

16:44.324 --> 16:45.391
Hell, no.
I'm going with Chuck.

16:49.296 --> 16:51.297
Okay, great, that's the plan.
See you soon.

16:51.364 --> 16:52.965
I'll be outside.

16:57.938 --> 16:59.071
Interesting choice--

16:59.139 --> 17:00.839
choosing your mom
over your fianceé.

17:00.907 --> 17:03.642
Oh, come on, man, I was just
trying to make everyone feel...

17:03.710 --> 17:06.060
Wait a minute, wait, wait, is
that really how it looked?

17:06.146 --> 17:08.047
Just remember, Bartowski,
Sarah's the one

17:08.114 --> 17:10.883
you're gonna be sleeping next
to at the end of every day.

17:10.951 --> 17:12.268
She's the one you protect.

17:17.123 --> 17:18.924
Where's The Norseman?

17:18.992 --> 17:22.394
I don't know why Chuck
felt it was necessary

17:22.444 --> 17:24.246
to come and get me.

17:24.330 --> 17:26.448
I think Chuck wouldn't
have felt it necessary

17:26.532 --> 17:27.833
if you had any backup.

17:27.901 --> 17:31.437
Chuck knows that I can
take care of myself.

17:31.504 --> 17:33.439
Maybe, but now Chuck
and the rest of his family

17:33.506 --> 17:36.675
are in harm's way
two days before his wedding.

17:39.713 --> 17:42.965
The food here
is really ghastly.

17:45.585 --> 17:48.354
Where's the guard?

17:48.421 --> 17:49.955
It's been moved,
but I don't know where.

17:50.023 --> 17:52.258
Vivian's planning a meet to
sell it to the highest bidder.

17:52.325 --> 17:54.927
We got to get to that meet.
And we got to get out of here

17:54.995 --> 17:57.129
before Vivian finds out we know
about it and calls it off.

17:57.197 --> 17:59.315
Come on, let's go before
your girls kill each other.

17:59.399 --> 18:01.150
<i>You don't have to tell me twice.</i>

18:05.038 --> 18:06.905
Everything's still locked down.

18:08.041 --> 18:09.308
Hold your fire.

18:09.376 --> 18:12.778
They'll never kill me.
You don't know that.

18:15.832 --> 18:18.000
No interruptions, guard.

18:23.290 --> 18:25.424
Hello again, Frost.

18:27.627 --> 18:29.928
Sarah, the weapon's been
moved; Vivian's selling it.

18:29.980 --> 18:31.130
If she turns up,

18:31.197 --> 18:32.631
keep her alive
so the meet still happens.

18:32.699 --> 18:35.134
What do you want with me?

18:35.201 --> 18:37.403
I really just want
to see you dead.

18:37.470 --> 18:38.637
And I've been waiting

18:38.705 --> 18:39.838
for my young friend here

18:39.906 --> 18:42.274
to be ready to do it.

18:45.695 --> 18:47.312
Vivian, surely
this is one trigger

18:47.364 --> 18:49.915
that you'd like
to pull yourself.

18:49.982 --> 18:52.951
Vivian, I know
you won't do this.

18:54.287 --> 18:56.171
Do it, Vivian.

19:00.727 --> 19:02.127
Don't.

19:04.564 --> 19:06.382
Everybody against
the wall right now.

19:06.466 --> 19:08.183
- Move it. Now.
- Sarah!

19:08.268 --> 19:10.803
I'm sorry,
Frost has somewhere to be.

19:10.854 --> 19:12.221
Hey.

19:13.673 --> 19:15.190
Mom, it's time to go.

19:15.275 --> 19:16.742
Mom?

19:16.810 --> 19:19.111
The woman who betrayed my father

19:19.179 --> 19:22.514
is the mother of the man who's betrayed me?
Well, that makes sense.

19:22.582 --> 19:24.917
Vivian, there is still so much that you
don't know and we need to talk about.

19:24.984 --> 19:26.819
No, I'm done talking to you.

19:27.954 --> 19:29.221
Guards could be here any second.

19:29.289 --> 19:30.205
Come on, we got to move.

19:30.290 --> 19:31.890
Let's go.

19:31.958 --> 19:33.742
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

19:42.302 --> 19:45.037
Guards? Guards!

19:55.160 --> 19:57.228
Okay, well...

19:57.296 --> 20:00.832
since we're not on a long
plane ride home with my mom now,

20:00.900 --> 20:02.934
maybe we should talk about
what what happened in the mine.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.035
Okay. Talk.

20:05.237 --> 20:06.688
All right, so, first of all,

20:06.772 --> 20:08.506
I know I messed up,
but I was just trying

20:08.574 --> 20:10.174
to get all of us
out of there safely.

20:10.226 --> 20:11.843
I mean, the places
was crawling with bad guys.

20:11.911 --> 20:14.011
I know--
but sometimes it feels like

20:14.063 --> 20:17.215
you can protect me from
anything... except your mom.

20:17.283 --> 20:18.199
No, you're right.

20:18.284 --> 20:19.217
You're right,

20:19.285 --> 20:20.685
but I-I can protect you,

20:20.736 --> 20:22.403
even from my mom, I promise.

20:26.158 --> 20:28.426
Beckman needs us at Castle.

20:28.494 --> 20:30.695
No need to unpack.

20:31.997 --> 20:33.965
Team,
it looks like Vivian Volkoff

20:34.033 --> 20:35.700
is indeed planning
to auction off

20:35.768 --> 20:36.868
The Norseman device

20:36.936 --> 20:39.370
in Moscow in 12 hours.

20:39.438 --> 20:41.139
It's up to you.
We must strike now.

20:41.206 --> 20:42.807
Uh, but can't someone else go?

20:42.875 --> 20:44.776
I mean, our rehearsal
dinner is tomorrow.

20:44.843 --> 20:45.877
I'm afraid we don't

20:45.945 --> 20:48.112
have time to train a new team.

20:48.180 --> 20:49.747
Oh, and thanks for the invite.

20:49.815 --> 20:50.448
Oh...

20:51.450 --> 20:52.417
N-No, um...

20:52.484 --> 20:53.785
I'm not serious.

20:53.852 --> 20:54.585
General, Vivian knows

20:54.653 --> 20:55.820
all of our faces, so how

20:55.888 --> 20:57.088
are we supposed to get in?

20:57.156 --> 20:58.289
Agent Bartowski,

20:58.357 --> 21:00.908
if you don't mind?

21:00.993 --> 21:02.226
An agent will impersonate

21:02.278 --> 21:03.661
one of the buyers.

21:03.729 --> 21:06.130
They'll outbid all of the others
for The Norseman device,

21:06.198 --> 21:08.266
and walk out the front
door; no bloodshed.

21:08.334 --> 21:10.568
Okay, except,
like Sarah just said,

21:10.619 --> 21:12.437
Vivian knows all of our faces.

21:12.504 --> 21:14.806
So not sure exactly
how to avoid the bloodshed.

21:14.873 --> 21:17.308
Vivian invited
Luckily, one of the buyers

21:17.376 --> 21:19.243
was just detained by Interpol:

21:19.311 --> 21:21.980
Italian arms smuggler
Etorre La Barba.

21:23.148 --> 21:26.250
Remind you of anyone we know?
Morgan?

21:26.318 --> 21:30.355
General, Grimes is not prepared
for an operation like this.

21:30.422 --> 21:32.824
He fits the profile.
We don't have time to argue.

21:32.891 --> 21:36.194
Good luck, Team.
You have your orders.

21:38.530 --> 21:40.765
<i>Etoray La barbah, huh?</i>

21:40.816 --> 21:41.799
<i>Ciaobella!</i>

21:41.867 --> 21:43.634
Eh, spaghetti pizza.

21:43.702 --> 21:45.936
<i>Eh, mamamia!</i>

21:45.988 --> 21:46.937
It's a-me, Mario.

21:46.989 --> 21:47.989
I sell-a the arms

21:48.073 --> 21:49.407
to-a the bad guys.

21:49.475 --> 21:50.675
This is a horrible idea.

21:50.743 --> 21:53.328
Buddy, are you absolutely sure

21:53.412 --> 21:54.962
that you feel
comfortable doing this?

21:55.047 --> 21:57.465
Sí, sí, si. Don't a-you
worry about-a me, huh?

21:57.549 --> 21:59.217
I take care of everything.
I am-a you Best-a Man!

21:59.284 --> 22:01.302
Whatever you need-- bada-boom!

22:01.387 --> 22:02.353
You have to stop that.

22:02.421 --> 22:04.455
Morgan will be fine.

22:04.523 --> 22:07.258
Casey, you and I will
provide plenty of backup.

22:09.795 --> 22:11.062
And you two will just stay here

22:11.129 --> 22:13.648
and get ready for the wedding.

22:13.732 --> 22:16.768
Stay here? What? You're taking
us off our own mission?

22:16.835 --> 22:17.769
I-I appreciate
you trying

22:17.836 --> 22:19.037
to protect us, Mom, I do,

22:19.104 --> 22:20.738
but Morgan is my best friend,

22:20.806 --> 22:22.340
and we've been on Vivian
Volkoff for months.

22:22.408 --> 22:24.409
In which time she's gone
from harmless coed

22:24.476 --> 22:26.511
to one of the world's
top weapons dealers.

22:26.578 --> 22:28.312
Which is why I had to step in
in the first place,

22:28.380 --> 22:29.364
to fix your mistake, sweetheart.

22:29.448 --> 22:32.667
Our mistake?
Um...

22:32.751 --> 22:34.001
I don't mean to be critical,

22:34.086 --> 22:35.920
but obviously,
you've been very busy

22:35.988 --> 22:37.855
getting ready for the wedding,
and your minds are elsewhere.

22:37.923 --> 22:39.857
Yeah, like maybe on the fact

22:39.925 --> 22:43.594
that Dad turned an innocent man
into Alexei Volkoff.

22:43.662 --> 22:45.329
Mom, did you know
about Agent X?

22:45.397 --> 22:47.832
Chuck, I could not afford
to let the CIA know

22:47.900 --> 22:49.600
that I knew about Agent X.

22:49.668 --> 22:51.018
And neither should you,

22:51.103 --> 22:52.353
which is obviously something
else we have to clean up.

22:52.438 --> 22:54.839
We don't have time for this
right now. The point is,

22:54.907 --> 22:56.507
Chuck and I are going on
our mission,

22:56.558 --> 22:58.843
you're providing backup, and
that's the way it's gonna be.

22:58.911 --> 23:00.344
I don't think so.
I agree with Sarah.

23:01.980 --> 23:03.548
Thank you.

23:03.615 --> 23:04.365
That is...

23:04.450 --> 23:05.566
Sorry, sorry, sorry, guys,

23:05.651 --> 23:07.618
I need to borrow the
big guy for one second.

23:07.686 --> 23:08.853
Just best man stuff
that just dawned on me.

23:08.921 --> 23:10.154
I have to...

23:10.222 --> 23:12.356
Thanks, buddy, it was getting
kind of tense in there.

23:12.408 --> 23:15.193
No problem, but you know the errand
you gave me to take care of--

23:15.260 --> 23:17.929
obviously I can't get to it
right now, but not a problem.

23:17.996 --> 23:20.698
Got my top people on
it, so not to worry.

23:20.766 --> 23:22.967
Couldn't we have just watched
this at home? I have, like,

23:23.035 --> 23:24.919
- a million things to do today.
- Yeah, I love

23:25.003 --> 23:27.805
popcorn and massages as much
as the next guy, but can we just

23:27.873 --> 23:29.073
get this started?

23:29.141 --> 23:30.441
Moviemaking is
a collaborative art,

23:30.509 --> 23:32.043
even for an auteur.

23:32.111 --> 23:33.277
I have many people

23:33.345 --> 23:34.946
I'd like to thank--
my rep

23:35.013 --> 23:38.416
Big Mike, Jeffrey,
my parents-ish,

23:38.484 --> 23:40.418
and, uh...

23:41.854 --> 23:44.255
...my main man upstairs.

23:44.323 --> 23:45.590
Anything is possible.

23:46.825 --> 23:48.609
Let's get this puppy started,

23:48.694 --> 23:49.744
shall we, Jeffrey?

24:04.409 --> 24:06.577
Heart.

24:06.645 --> 24:07.778
Pancreas.

24:09.214 --> 24:10.414
Cockle.

24:10.482 --> 24:11.682
My cockle.

24:16.221 --> 24:17.138
America.

24:17.222 --> 24:18.156
Stop, stop, stop.

24:18.223 --> 24:19.423
Please, make it stop,
make it stop.

24:19.475 --> 24:21.359
God.
Dude, dude, that is just unholy.

24:21.426 --> 24:23.311
Thank you.
Okay,

24:23.395 --> 24:25.029
I am going to need the
footage from your clients.

24:25.096 --> 24:27.031
I'm gonna be taking
over from here.

24:27.098 --> 24:28.649
W-Wait, does that mean

24:28.734 --> 24:30.101
Big Mike doesn't get
his ten percent?

24:30.169 --> 24:31.335
We weren't even paying them.

24:31.403 --> 24:33.154
What?

24:33.238 --> 24:34.939
Then what was I doing all day?

24:36.575 --> 24:38.493
How do you guys feel that went?

24:45.551 --> 24:47.468
Hey, what do you think?

24:47.553 --> 24:49.003
I finally got the accent down.

24:49.087 --> 24:53.224
Don't move or I will kill you

24:53.292 --> 24:55.292
whereas you stand

24:55.344 --> 24:58.229
<i>and not even your madre
will recognize your corpse.</i>

24:59.297 --> 25:00.698
Yeah.

25:00.766 --> 25:03.367
If I had my druthers, you'd stay
topside selling microwaves.

25:03.435 --> 25:04.485
That's great, that's great.

25:04.570 --> 25:06.687
Let's, let's,
let's figure this out

25:06.755 --> 25:08.122
'cause I thought
we were past all this.

25:08.190 --> 25:10.675
We're roomies, you've been
training me really hard,

25:10.742 --> 25:12.176
I've been in danger
a ton of times,

25:12.244 --> 25:13.694
and not to mention you love
the little snack packs

25:13.779 --> 25:15.012
I bring on missions.

25:15.080 --> 25:19.200
So, why suddenly are you
being this big jerk to me?

25:19.284 --> 25:22.153
It's Alex.

25:22.221 --> 25:23.153
She's worried about you.

25:23.205 --> 25:25.155
Oh.

25:25.207 --> 25:26.757
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait,

25:26.825 --> 25:28.593
okay, okay,

25:28.660 --> 25:30.261
you're telling me you are being

25:30.329 --> 25:33.030
a jerk because you care?

25:34.132 --> 25:35.132
Yeah.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.767
Fat load of good
it's done me, too.

25:36.835 --> 25:38.502
I promised Alex
I'd keep you safe.

25:38.570 --> 25:39.737
There are times
on every mission

25:39.805 --> 25:41.539
when things go sideways.

25:41.607 --> 25:43.808
That happens,
I can't protect you,

25:43.875 --> 25:45.543
and I've broken a promise
to my daughter.

25:45.611 --> 25:47.111
I see your dilemma.

25:47.179 --> 25:48.813
Yeah.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.448
Everything's gonna be fine,
everything will be fine.

25:50.515 --> 25:53.484
Trust me,
nothing will go wrong.

25:53.535 --> 25:54.719
Why did I just say that?

25:54.786 --> 25:55.987
Mm-hmm.

26:02.728 --> 26:04.729
You know, you can
wait in the van

26:04.796 --> 26:06.697
if you want.
No, it's all right.

26:06.765 --> 26:08.132
I think I'll give
Chuck and Sarah

26:08.200 --> 26:10.034
a little space on this one.

26:10.102 --> 26:11.736
It's hard to have kids.

26:11.803 --> 26:13.871
You can't always protect 'em.

26:13.939 --> 26:15.973
Yeah, or their idiot boyfriends.

26:17.242 --> 26:18.309
We're in position.

26:18.377 --> 26:19.377
<i>Is Grimes ready?</i>

26:19.444 --> 26:20.544
Just a second, Casey.

26:20.596 --> 26:23.898
I-I don't know if I
can do this, uh, guys.

26:23.982 --> 26:25.349
I've been thinking
about it, and, um--

26:25.417 --> 26:27.118
you know, what do I know
about being a bad guy?

26:27.185 --> 26:28.853
Plenty, buddy, plenty.

26:28.904 --> 26:29.854
Look at that suit--

26:29.905 --> 26:31.389
part Goldfinger,
part Drax, right?

26:31.456 --> 26:32.657
You noticed.

26:32.724 --> 26:34.058
Come on, seriously, you got
nothing to worry about.

26:34.109 --> 26:36.911
We're going to be with you
the whole time on the comms,

26:36.995 --> 26:39.196
not to mention the fact
that we will be monitoring

26:39.247 --> 26:41.616
the video feed
through these glasses.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.868
And Casey will be
on the opposite rooftop

26:43.919 --> 26:45.119
with a sniper rifle.

26:45.203 --> 26:46.737
You know how he likes
to shoot things from far away.

26:46.805 --> 26:48.589
I do, yeah.

26:48.674 --> 26:50.875
You can do this,
Morgan, you can totally be

26:50.942 --> 26:51.876
a bad guy.

26:51.943 --> 26:53.243
Okay, yeah,

26:53.295 --> 26:54.411
it's going to be great.

27:39.424 --> 27:41.008
This'd better not take long.

27:41.093 --> 27:43.561
I already tried to kill
three people at this table.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.317
Yes.

27:50.402 --> 27:53.170
What do you mean?

27:53.238 --> 27:55.172
No, you heard me the first time.

27:55.240 --> 27:56.640
Shoot the puppy.

27:56.708 --> 27:58.609
I am so sick of feeding him.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.277
Kill the puppy.

28:00.328 --> 28:01.478
<i>Ciao.</i>

28:04.366 --> 28:08.119
So hard to get good
henchmen nowadays, hmm?

28:08.186 --> 28:10.121
<i>Si, si.</i>

28:11.189 --> 28:12.957
Thorium signature detected.

28:13.024 --> 28:15.025
Looks like they're bringing
in the Norseman. Casey?

28:22.467 --> 28:24.368
Welcome, gentlemen, I'm so sorry

28:24.436 --> 28:26.003
to have kept you waiting.

28:26.071 --> 28:27.371
You're all here for
the same reason:

28:27.439 --> 28:29.006
a chance to purchase

28:29.057 --> 28:31.175
one of the deadliest weapons
ever created--

28:31.243 --> 28:33.227
the Norseman device.

28:33.311 --> 28:35.229
By locking onto a target's DNA,

28:35.313 --> 28:38.348
it can kill a single person
in the middle of a crowd

28:38.400 --> 28:40.451
with 100% accuracy.

28:40.519 --> 28:41.919
<i>Perfecto.</i>

28:41.987 --> 28:43.154
There's no way to run from it,

28:43.221 --> 28:44.522
even on the other side
of the world.

28:44.589 --> 28:45.956
Whoever ends up with it has

28:46.024 --> 28:47.425
an enormous advantage,

28:47.492 --> 28:48.659
but, truth is...

28:49.895 --> 28:51.829
...it's an advantage
I intend to keep.

29:07.512 --> 29:09.146
What do I do, guys?

29:09.214 --> 29:10.481
Morgan,

29:10.549 --> 29:11.882
Morgan, you have to die,

29:11.950 --> 29:13.884
or they're going to kill you.
Do it.

29:13.952 --> 29:15.519
Oh, no!

29:15.570 --> 29:16.553
Aah!

29:17.606 --> 29:19.089
Morgan,

29:19.157 --> 29:21.358
whatever you do, stay calm.

29:27.437 --> 29:28.871
Mom, Casey, tell me
you got a line on him.

29:28.939 --> 29:30.339
I got him in my sights.

29:30.407 --> 29:31.807
If it gets hot,
I'll take 'em all out.

29:31.875 --> 29:34.193
Don't feel bad, Vivian.

29:34.278 --> 29:37.380
Every man in this room
would have killed you

29:37.447 --> 29:38.814
without a second thought.

29:38.882 --> 29:40.483
That's why we
collected their DNA.

29:40.550 --> 29:44.820
This one-- he killed all
the families of his rivals.

29:44.888 --> 29:45.855
Sick.

29:45.923 --> 29:47.823
And this one...

29:49.059 --> 29:50.593
...he gassed an
entire village

29:50.661 --> 29:52.361
of innocents
just to eliminate...

29:53.847 --> 29:55.798
...one enemy.

29:55.866 --> 29:56.999
Sicker.

29:57.067 --> 29:59.602
And this one right
here with the beard...

29:59.670 --> 30:00.937
Stop.

30:01.004 --> 30:02.405
These are dangerous men--
I get it.

30:02.472 --> 30:04.040
Vivian,

30:04.107 --> 30:07.843
I'm not trying to turn you
into someone you're not.

30:07.911 --> 30:11.547
I'm trying to turn you
into who you need to be.

30:13.250 --> 30:15.184
And you may still
get your chance.

30:15.252 --> 30:16.252
What do you mean?

30:16.320 --> 30:19.055
There is a man in this room

30:19.122 --> 30:20.373
who isn't actually dead--

30:20.457 --> 30:21.857
someone

30:21.925 --> 30:24.060
who has infiltrated
our organization

30:24.127 --> 30:26.896
by pretending to be someone
we invited here today.

30:26.964 --> 30:27.897
He's merely

30:27.965 --> 30:29.298
feigning death.

30:29.366 --> 30:30.433
Riley left my scope.

30:30.500 --> 30:31.734
I do not have Riley.

30:31.802 --> 30:32.535
Morgan, Morgan,

30:32.602 --> 30:33.803
don't move.

30:33.870 --> 30:36.839
So, friend,

30:36.907 --> 30:38.841
are you going to get up?

30:42.846 --> 30:43.746
The name's Carlisle.

30:45.349 --> 30:46.983
Sebastian Carlisle.

30:47.050 --> 30:48.317
Carl to my friends,

30:48.385 --> 30:51.220
which you are not.

30:51.271 --> 30:53.489
I take it you're MI6?

30:53.557 --> 30:56.859
I've been tracking you
since Munich.

30:56.927 --> 30:58.160
It was actually rather clever.

30:58.228 --> 30:59.161
You see,

30:59.229 --> 31:00.246
first I cr...

31:04.568 --> 31:06.936
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.

31:07.004 --> 31:09.071
Next one's yours, promise.

31:11.375 --> 31:13.292
Chuck,

31:13.377 --> 31:14.443
Sarah,

31:14.511 --> 31:15.644
Norseman's on the move.

31:15.712 --> 31:16.645
You're on it, go.

31:16.713 --> 31:17.847
Copy that.

31:17.914 --> 31:19.348
Looks like they're taking it
out of the building.

31:19.416 --> 31:21.017
I'm going to help them
secure the weapon.

31:21.084 --> 31:23.969
You stay here and keep
Alex's boyfriend safe.

31:24.054 --> 31:25.971
Roger that.

31:27.824 --> 31:28.858
Weapon's leaving the building.

31:28.925 --> 31:30.693
You ready?
Yeah.

31:30.761 --> 31:35.464
Always wanted to say this--
fasten your seat belt.

31:35.532 --> 31:37.450
Literally, you should fasten
your seat belt right now.

31:37.534 --> 31:38.451
Oh, okay, sure.

31:40.437 --> 31:43.105
Guys...

31:43.173 --> 31:45.174
I haven't heard anything
in a while.

31:45.242 --> 31:47.710
Please tell me
it's okay to move.

31:47.778 --> 31:49.995
Wait, wa-wa-wait.

31:50.080 --> 31:52.048
Okay, okay, go quick.

31:52.115 --> 31:53.082
I'll cover you.

31:58.488 --> 32:00.423
Somebody-somebody-somebody's
coming, somebody's coming.

32:11.601 --> 32:13.602
Oh, Casey, they got acid,

32:13.670 --> 32:15.187
just like
in that really disgusting scene

32:15.272 --> 32:16.305
<i>from Breaking Bad.</i>

32:16.373 --> 32:18.340
<i>I've never seen Breaking Bad.</i>

32:18.408 --> 32:20.176
You'd love it, it's great.
What?

32:20.243 --> 32:21.677
It's like the perfect
counterprogramming to...

32:21.745 --> 32:24.246
the curtains. I can't see you.
Morgan, shut up! They closed

32:24.314 --> 32:27.316
I can't protect you
if I can't see the targets.

32:27.384 --> 32:28.484
Run!

32:28.552 --> 32:29.668
Okay.

32:31.621 --> 32:33.255
What the...?
Oh. Who's that?

32:33.323 --> 32:35.324
Hey. Hey, just one sec...

32:35.375 --> 32:36.825
Did it!

32:38.211 --> 32:39.762
Use your glasses.

32:39.830 --> 32:41.514
Show me the targets
with your glasses, Morgan.

32:41.598 --> 32:42.965
And try not to move.

33:01.118 --> 33:02.518
Morgan?

33:05.288 --> 33:07.056
Morgan, can you hear me?!

33:11.094 --> 33:12.795
Morgan, can you hear me?

33:12.863 --> 33:14.463
Morgan!

33:14.531 --> 33:15.881
Yeah. Yeah.

33:18.468 --> 33:20.035
Oh...

33:20.103 --> 33:22.404
Casey, I think you shot me.

33:22.472 --> 33:23.506
What about the rest?

33:26.042 --> 33:27.543
Yeah, they're all dead.

33:27.611 --> 33:29.378
Casey, that was amazing!

33:29.446 --> 33:31.263
Oh, Lord, I feel faint.

33:31.348 --> 33:33.349
Just breathe.

33:33.400 --> 33:35.084
Get to the elevator.

33:35.152 --> 33:36.785
I'll meet you outside.

33:36.853 --> 33:38.921
Yeah. Yeah.

33:41.892 --> 33:44.727
Looks like
they're leaving the building.

34:10.085 --> 34:13.155
The weapon's in the trunk.

34:13.223 --> 34:16.257
I'm going to get something
to open it.

34:16.326 --> 34:18.060
You all right?

34:18.128 --> 34:20.563
Don't pretend to care.

34:20.630 --> 34:22.614
Vivian, I am truly sorry

34:22.699 --> 34:24.333
for everything that's happened,

34:24.400 --> 34:25.768
but there is so much
that you don't know.

34:25.835 --> 34:28.137
I know enough.
I know that you're Agent X.

34:28.205 --> 34:29.438
No, Vivian, I'm not.

34:29.505 --> 34:32.775
Agent X... is your father.

34:32.842 --> 34:34.643
He was an MI6 agent.

34:34.710 --> 34:36.011
He was going undercover.

34:36.079 --> 34:38.179
He let the CIA perform
an experiment on him--

34:38.248 --> 34:40.449
one that changed him
into the man

34:40.516 --> 34:42.952
we know now as Alexei Volkoff.

34:43.018 --> 34:44.719
But before that,
he wasn't evil,

34:44.788 --> 34:46.088
and neither are you.

34:46.156 --> 34:49.158
This... This is crazy.

34:49.226 --> 34:52.094
Don't move.

34:52.161 --> 34:53.762
Riley, is this true?

34:53.830 --> 34:57.199
Yes, I'm afraid it is.

34:57.267 --> 35:01.470
But, first, are you
going to tell her

35:01.521 --> 35:04.673
who turned her father
into Alexei Volkoff, huh?

35:04.741 --> 35:06.609
It was Stephen J. Bartowski.

35:06.676 --> 35:08.043
Chuck's father.

35:08.111 --> 35:10.679
He and Frost manipulated
your father to give up

35:10.747 --> 35:12.815
his own identity so they could
further their CIA careers.

35:12.882 --> 35:14.516
That's a lie!

35:14.584 --> 35:15.818
No, it's the truth!

35:15.885 --> 35:18.120
And I will not have you
lie to Vivian anymore.

35:18.188 --> 35:19.672
No!

35:22.959 --> 35:24.760
Chuck.

35:25.629 --> 35:27.630
You saved me.

35:27.697 --> 35:29.164
Always.

35:31.351 --> 35:33.802
Where's Vivian?

35:36.773 --> 35:37.973
We have to find her.

35:38.041 --> 35:38.907
No.

35:38.975 --> 35:41.010
We should go.

35:41.077 --> 35:43.145
You two have somewhere to be.

35:58.191 --> 35:59.358
Honey, I totally
dropped the ball

35:59.426 --> 36:00.693
on Chuck's present to Sarah.

36:00.760 --> 36:02.761
I fell asleep right in the
middle of cutting it.

36:02.829 --> 36:04.563
You did what you could.

36:04.631 --> 36:05.948
It'll be okay.

36:06.032 --> 36:10.236
Look. There they are
right now.

36:10.287 --> 36:12.805
Guys, wow!

36:12.873 --> 36:15.007
The courtyard--
it looks unbelievable.

36:15.075 --> 36:17.243
I can't believe
you did all this for us, Ellie.

36:17.310 --> 36:18.677
Thank you so much, sis.

36:18.745 --> 36:22.631
I promised myself that
I wasn't gonna cry.

36:22.716 --> 36:24.500
Mascara!

36:28.388 --> 36:30.306
You ready for this?

36:30.390 --> 36:32.858
Absolutely.

36:47.941 --> 36:49.241
Okay.

36:58.535 --> 37:00.836
Hey.

37:00.921 --> 37:03.556
Man, does Big Mike need
this brandy Alexander.

37:03.623 --> 37:05.708
Had another deal blow up
in my face.

37:05.792 --> 37:07.209
Huh.

37:07.294 --> 37:08.594
But I do love the game.

37:08.662 --> 37:10.496
What happened to your arm?

37:10.564 --> 37:12.531
Wii Tennis.

37:12.599 --> 37:16.168
Son, it's amazing you're not single.
Mm.

37:19.272 --> 37:21.190
Casey.

37:21.274 --> 37:23.175
How's the Sunshine Band, buddy?

37:23.226 --> 37:24.810
It's KC and the Sunshine...

37:24.861 --> 37:27.146
No one's ever used that
on you, huh?

37:27.197 --> 37:28.530
Really?

37:28.615 --> 37:30.515
Seriously, um,
there is one more thing

37:30.567 --> 37:32.751
I wanted to talk about.
You're right.

37:32.819 --> 37:34.320
I shouldn't be out there
in the field.

37:34.371 --> 37:35.487
Nah, not
if it's making the woman

37:35.538 --> 37:37.189
I love worry, so you tell Alex

37:37.257 --> 37:39.375
I'm done, I am out.

37:39.459 --> 37:41.660
Why don't you stand tall
and tell her yourself?

37:41.728 --> 37:43.212
Nah, it's better

37:43.296 --> 37:44.546
coming from you, I think.

37:44.631 --> 37:46.548
No, no, why don't you
tell her yourself?

37:47.884 --> 37:49.168
Okay.

37:49.219 --> 37:50.536
Hi.

37:50.604 --> 37:52.671
I love you.

37:52.722 --> 37:54.406
<i>I love you.</i>

37:56.509 --> 37:59.078
Is he watching?
No.

37:59.145 --> 38:00.379
Should I walk away?

38:04.317 --> 38:06.385
♪ ♪

38:14.661 --> 38:16.028
Many of you might not

38:16.096 --> 38:20.532
know me, but I am
Chuck's and Ellie's mom.

38:20.600 --> 38:22.468
Truth be told,

38:22.535 --> 38:25.704
I was gone for a long time,

38:25.772 --> 38:29.608
and now that I'm back in
their lives, I sometimes

38:29.676 --> 38:31.243
overcompensate.

38:31.311 --> 38:33.712
But lucky for me,

38:33.780 --> 38:35.814
my soon-to-be daughter-in-law

38:35.882 --> 38:37.983
is very forgiving.

38:38.051 --> 38:40.953
She's never heard me say it,

38:41.021 --> 38:43.989
but Sarah is one
of the strongest

38:44.057 --> 38:47.793
and one of the most amazing
women that I have ever met.

38:47.861 --> 38:53.565
So I would like
to propose this toast to her.

38:53.633 --> 38:56.969
Sarah, thank you
for taking care of my Chuck.

38:57.037 --> 39:00.506
May you have many
more adventures

39:00.573 --> 39:03.976
together, and may you always
keep each other safe.

39:04.044 --> 39:06.962
Oh.

39:07.047 --> 39:08.747
Thank you.

39:08.815 --> 39:09.982
Love you.

39:10.050 --> 39:11.083
Love you.

39:11.134 --> 39:12.284
Now for the little surprise

39:12.335 --> 39:15.421
I've been cooking up for you.

39:19.259 --> 39:20.792
Mm-hmm.

39:20.844 --> 39:22.428
Excuse me. Hi.

39:24.431 --> 39:27.683
Chuck, there's something
I need to tell you about

39:27.767 --> 39:28.851
the video. It's...

39:28.935 --> 39:30.536
What about the video?

39:30.603 --> 39:32.037
Oh.

39:55.261 --> 39:57.396
Lester never let
you see my version.

39:57.464 --> 39:59.364
Hope you like it.

40:21.087 --> 40:23.222
What is this garbage?

40:55.738 --> 40:57.923
Hello?

40:57.991 --> 40:59.124
Hello, Chuck.

40:59.192 --> 41:00.409
I hope I'm not

41:00.493 --> 41:02.427
interrupting anything important.

41:02.495 --> 41:04.096
Vivian, what do you want?

41:04.164 --> 41:07.633
To make you feel pain,
the way I feel right now.

41:07.700 --> 41:10.085
I've lost everyone
important to me,

41:10.170 --> 41:12.371
and I have you and your family
to thank for it.

41:12.422 --> 41:14.540
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
We can talk about this.

41:14.607 --> 41:16.775
Or how about you look
around the room at all your

41:16.843 --> 41:18.877
family and friends,

41:18.945 --> 41:22.881
and ask yourself, which one
am I going to take from you?

41:24.851 --> 41:27.820
You see, I still have
another Norseman device.

41:27.887 --> 41:30.255
Ple-Please, please.

41:30.306 --> 41:31.440
Vivian,

41:31.524 --> 41:32.891
this is not you.

41:32.942 --> 41:34.393
Okay, you don't do things
like this.

41:34.460 --> 41:35.594
Please don't do this.

41:35.645 --> 41:37.896
I already have.

41:40.066 --> 41:42.401
What's going on?

41:42.468 --> 41:44.953
I think Vivian's going
to try and kill my mom.

41:45.038 --> 41:47.956
Oh, God, what is that noise?!

41:50.343 --> 41:51.410
Oh.

41:52.128 --> 41:53.512
Oh...

41:53.580 --> 41:54.646
Oh!

41:56.132 --> 41:58.083
Sarah? Sarah? Sarah!
No! No! No! No! No! No!

41:58.134 --> 41:59.668
No! No! No! No!
No! No! Sarah!

41:59.752 --> 42:01.119
Help me!

42:01.171 --> 42:02.588
Help me. Help me.

42:02.639 --> 42:05.340
Help me.
Somebody help.

42:05.425 --> 42:06.291
Calling 911.

42:06.342 --> 42:07.626
Oh, my God.

42:07.677 --> 42:09.311
Oh, my God.
Baby, baby, baby.

42:09.395 --> 42:10.462
Baby.

42:10.513 --> 42:12.264
Baby? Oh, my God.
