08:59.959 --> 09:01.333
When I finally find her,

09:01.333 --> 09:04.125
I will approach her,
and I'll show her my hands

09:04.125 --> 09:05.583
and I'll say
"I have no weapons."

09:05.583 --> 09:06.625

09:06.625 --> 09:08.542

about shooting me?"

09:08.542 --> 09:09.625
She can say yay or nay.

09:09.625 --> 09:12.542
My response will be
the same for each: "So am I."

09:12.542 --> 09:13.959
Shoot her in her shoulder,

09:13.959 --> 09:15.125
shoot her in her hip,

09:15.125 --> 09:17.875
blow up her vehicle,
even-stevens.
"So am I"?

09:17.875 --> 09:19.166
How is that even a response

09:19.166 --> 09:20.875
to "Do you feel bad
about shooting me"?

09:20.875 --> 09:22.709
It should be,
"So do I."

09:22.709 --> 09:24.792
Just leave me alone
with my birds.

09:24.792 --> 09:26.959
Leave you alone?
I'm not gonna leave
you with your birds.

09:26.959 --> 09:29.083
I can't-- Stop, Russell!
You're not a cripple!

09:29.083 --> 09:32.667
Gamby, you're a caged beast.

09:32.667 --> 09:36.458
Well, it's time for that beast
to come out and play!

09:36.458 --> 09:37.500
Russell!

09:37.500 --> 09:38.458
Ow!

09:38.458 --> 09:40.125
What the fuck
are you doing, Russell?

09:40.125 --> 09:42.417
The fuck you mean
what am I doing?

09:42.417 --> 09:43.625
Get up!

09:43.625 --> 09:45.500
Get your fat ass up!

09:46.417 --> 09:47.667
Don't you see?

09:47.667 --> 09:49.333
You're pushing everybody away.

09:49.333 --> 09:51.000
Now, you've already
done it to Snodgrass

09:51.000 --> 09:53.125
and you're about to do
the same thing to me.

09:53.125 --> 09:56.000
If you don't stand up
right now...

09:56.000 --> 09:59.166
Get off your fat
fucking ass right now!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

09:59.166 --> 10:01.667
Stop!
...I'm done with you!

10:01.667 --> 10:03.667
Now get up!

10:03.667 --> 10:06.667
Like a beached whale. God.

10:06.667 --> 10:08.291

12:58.500 --> 12:59.667
He belongs right here

12:59.667 --> 13:02.208
on the earthly plain
with us!

13:02.208 --> 13:03.875
Neal Gamby was shot

13:03.875 --> 13:06.667
by a stereo thief,
a coward,

13:06.667 --> 13:09.000
in the parking lot
of this very school.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.709
But he returns to us

13:10.709 --> 13:14.834
to do what he loves
more than anything
in the world,

13:14.834 --> 13:17.959
and that is being
a vice principal.

13:17.959 --> 13:21.792
Now, I know North Jackson
is thrilled to have him back.

13:21.792 --> 13:25.083
To our returning
real life hero,

13:25.083 --> 13:27.208
Neal Gamby!

13:27.208 --> 13:29.834
(cheering)

13:32.166 --> 13:35.000
Please, Russell...
Just do it.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.500
No one, uh, informed me

13:36.500 --> 13:38.083
that this program
was happening today,

13:38.083 --> 13:39.667
so I didn't prepare any words.

13:39.667 --> 13:42.041
Oh, well, you--
Then you don't--
Then just make it up.

13:43.208 --> 13:44.208
Just...

13:45.125 --> 13:48.041
A, uh, very funny thing

13:48.041 --> 13:51.417
about when you get shot
is that you...

13:51.417 --> 13:54.875
have trouble sleeping,
you wake up screaming,

13:54.875 --> 13:58.625
covered in sweat,
scared, angry,

13:58.625 --> 14:00.583
not at the person
who shot you,

14:00.583 --> 14:04.417
but at God
for not letting you die.

14:07.166 --> 14:10.291
It's, uh, good to be back.
Thank you.

14:10.291 --> 14:11.375
Baby steps.

14:11.375 --> 14:12.583
That-- that's enough steps.

14:12.583 --> 14:15.917
Uh, Tigers,
I want you to join me

14:15.917 --> 14:17.834
in helping bring about some--

14:17.834 --> 14:19.458
Just leave him alone please.
PTSD is serious.

14:19.458 --> 14:21.333
Please just leave
him alone.
No, I don't have PTSD.

14:21.333 --> 14:23.750
Just don't tell people that,
okay? Thank you.
Please join me

14:23.750 --> 14:26.125
with a big Tiger...

14:26.125 --> 14:29.792
(roaring)

14:33.542 --> 14:35.333
No.
We love you, Neal Gamby.

14:35.333 --> 14:38.792
Okay, the light needs
to stop shining on me now.

14:38.792 --> 14:39.875
Back to him, goddammit.

14:39.875 --> 14:41.417
Put it right here,
on me.

14:41.417 --> 14:44.291
(school bell chimes)

14:49.250 --> 14:50.917
Why do you gotta be
such a party pooper?

14:50.917 --> 14:53.583
The school doesn't even look
like the same place I left.

14:53.583 --> 14:55.625
Why the hell didn't you tell me
about all these changes?

14:55.625 --> 14:57.125
Because I knew
that you would hate it.

14:57.125 --> 14:59.041
But we had to rebrand
after the shooting.

14:59.041 --> 15:02.125
"Warriors" makes
everybody think of fighting
and attempted murder.

15:02.125 --> 15:04.583
Well, "Tigers" makes me think
about taking a dog shit.

15:04.583 --> 15:05.959
Woman:
Ya punks!

15:05.959 --> 15:08.250
I'll take you
little reefer addicts
all the way to the mat.

15:08.250 --> 15:09.458
Who the fuck's the butch?

15:09.458 --> 15:11.125
Oh, that's Vice Principal Nash.
(Nash yells)

15:11.125 --> 15:12.458
"Vice Principal Nash"?

15:12.458 --> 15:14.208
You hired a vice principal?
Will you fucking relax?

15:14.208 --> 15:15.709
You were gone
and I needed a little muscle.

15:15.709 --> 15:17.000
Besides, you're gonna
love Nash.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.583
She's built like a corncob pipe,
swears like a sailor,

15:19.583 --> 15:22.542
and the only thing she likes
better than kicking ass
is eating pussy.

15:22.542 --> 15:24.834
Plus, I think y'all go
to the same barber.

15:24.834 --> 15:27.333
Vice Principal Gimpy,
how are ya?

15:27.333 --> 15:28.625
The name's Gamby.

15:28.625 --> 15:30.834
Yeah, I know. I'm...
I'm just joshing ya.

15:30.834 --> 15:32.583
Well, don't josh me, okay?

15:32.583 --> 15:35.291
I don't think it's funny
when people make jokes
about what happened to me.

15:35.291 --> 15:37.834
My apologies.
No... no disrespect.

15:37.834 --> 15:40.333
What did Jason Deevers
and Phillip Simmons do here?

15:40.333 --> 15:42.500
These lowlifes thought
smoking dope

15:42.500 --> 15:45.291
was more important than going
to your memorial ceremony.

15:45.291 --> 15:47.417
Oh, a couple of dopers, huh?

15:47.417 --> 15:51.291
You guys know
what goes good with ganja?

15:51.291 --> 15:52.291
Popcorn.

15:52.291 --> 15:53.750
We don't do circles anymore.

15:53.750 --> 15:56.458
I know how much you hated
that touchy-feely bullshit.

15:56.458 --> 15:58.500
We're back
to in-school suspension.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.917
Oh, okay. Yeah.

15:59.917 --> 16:00.917
F circles.

16:00.917 --> 16:02.208
All right, fine. ISS.

16:02.208 --> 16:03.709
I will lead you.
Come with me.

16:03.709 --> 16:06.166
You know what, let's let
Nash do the dirty work.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.458
I wanna show you
what I did you my office.

16:08.458 --> 16:10.500
You have to see it.

16:10.500 --> 16:11.750
Okay, keep walking...

16:11.750 --> 16:13.792
Okay.
keep walking...
and stop.

16:13.792 --> 16:15.083
Ta-da!

16:16.875 --> 16:19.083
(laughs)
Wow.

16:19.083 --> 16:20.792
Still a work in progress,

16:20.792 --> 16:22.709
but you get the idea.
It's fantastic.

16:22.709 --> 16:24.500
I mean, the children
are saluting you

16:24.500 --> 16:25.959
and there's tigers and--

16:25.959 --> 16:27.500
You get what I'm going for.
Yeah.

16:29.333 --> 16:31.625
I mean, it's almost
like a Chinese buffet,
but, you know, classier.

16:31.625 --> 16:34.208
Look at this. That says
"Lee Russell. Principal."

16:34.208 --> 16:35.875
That's what this says.
Wow.

16:35.875 --> 16:38.542
Watch this.
You ever done this before?

16:38.542 --> 16:39.542
Huh?

16:39.542 --> 16:41.166
Pretty great. Pretty great.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.125
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You got really open hips.

16:43.125 --> 16:45.000
Oh, hey, Mr. Gamby.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.625
It's so good to see you.

16:46.625 --> 16:50.583
Um, here are
some gifts and cards
that people sent for you.

16:50.583 --> 16:52.750
Oh, it's good to see you,
too, but I don't want this.

16:52.750 --> 16:55.083
I don't know why the hell
everyone's giving me
a fucking gift basket.

16:55.083 --> 16:57.375
Oh, take it, Gamby.
No, I don't want it.
What am I gonna do with it?

16:57.375 --> 17:00.166
People care about you.
Get it out of here
'cause I don't want it.

17:00.166 --> 17:02.417
People just want
to welcome you back.
I don't need a teddy bear

17:02.417 --> 17:05.375
and balloons and suckers.
Russell, where the hell
have you been?

17:05.375 --> 17:08.083
I don't understand-- Gamby!

17:08.083 --> 17:10.291
Ha! So good
to have you back!

17:10.291 --> 17:12.709
Mr. Russell,
Superintendent Haas
is here to see you.

17:12.709 --> 17:14.375
Thank you for
the timely notice, Mrs. Swift.

17:14.375 --> 17:16.208
You fucking idiot.
Go. Take that box.

17:16.208 --> 17:19.417
So what's it feel like
to get hit with a bullet?

17:19.417 --> 17:20.750
Did not make my body feel good.

17:20.750 --> 17:23.625
(laughs)
I can only imagine!

17:23.625 --> 17:25.333
Oh, the world we live in, huh?

17:25.333 --> 17:26.667
Well, we'll have
to catch up later

17:26.667 --> 17:28.834
'cause Lee and I have
some issues to discuss.

17:28.834 --> 17:31.041
Don't we, Lee?
Yes. I-- I think
maybe we should let

17:31.041 --> 17:33.542
Gamby do the rounds
so that he can get reacquainted

17:33.542 --> 17:35.125
with all of the changes
in the school

17:35.125 --> 17:37.250
while you and I talk.

17:37.250 --> 17:38.625
That's a good idea.

17:38.625 --> 17:41.917
Well, good to be back
and great work
on the office, Russell.

17:41.917 --> 17:44.125
It looks terrific. Uh...

17:44.125 --> 17:45.125
Open or closed?

17:45.125 --> 17:46.667
Open.
Closed.

17:46.667 --> 17:48.625
He-- he said to do closed.

17:50.083 --> 17:51.583
Haas:
Have a seat, Lee.

17:51.583 --> 17:53.625
At least the chair's
in the budget.
I'm just trying to improve

17:53.625 --> 17:55.917
the general atmosphere--
Trying to do what?
What the hell is that?

17:55.917 --> 17:58.250
That's not a couch.
It's an Egyptian barge!

18:00.959 --> 18:02.125
Gamby:
Tony.

18:07.333 --> 18:08.834
Oh, hey.

18:09.750 --> 18:12.166
Look who's back in town.
Yeah.

18:12.166 --> 18:13.709
Tiger Town, apparently.

18:13.709 --> 18:17.166
Yeah, there have been
a lot of changes.

18:17.166 --> 18:18.125
So, uh...

18:18.125 --> 18:21.375
how's the old hip?
Pretty much sucks.

18:21.375 --> 18:22.583
It's all black and rotten.

18:22.583 --> 18:25.125
It's green and reddish scabs

18:25.125 --> 18:26.875
and crust, bumps...

18:28.000 --> 18:29.709
I'm just kidding.
It's not corroded.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.333
It-- it's healed.
It's just like a scar now.

18:31.333 --> 18:33.875
Neal, I called you
a bunch of times.

18:33.875 --> 18:36.208
I tried to visit you
in the hospital.

18:36.208 --> 18:38.500
Sent you a fruit basket,
you know--
I never got a fruit basket.

18:38.500 --> 18:39.667
I didn't get a phone call.

18:39.667 --> 18:41.500
Well, Amanda,
it's probably just because

18:41.500 --> 18:44.208
physically, I wasn't capable
of making phone calls.

18:44.208 --> 18:46.750
You know, I've--
I've had to learn how
to redo a lot of things

18:46.750 --> 18:48.291
that most people
just take for granted.

18:48.291 --> 18:49.834
You know, like walking

18:49.834 --> 18:52.208
or wiggling your toes,

18:52.208 --> 18:54.834
holding a telephone.
Okay, but...

18:54.834 --> 18:58.333
I thought it was a bit weird
that you cut me off like that.

18:58.333 --> 18:59.917
Hi.
What the fuck?

18:59.917 --> 19:00.875
Ugh.

19:00.875 --> 19:03.166
Sorry. Did I hug
the bullet hole?

19:03.166 --> 19:05.875
Didn't mean to do that.
I just missed you so much.

19:11.875 --> 19:13.083
Yeah, yeah. Cool.

19:13.083 --> 19:14.834

who knows what he likes.

19:14.834 --> 19:16.667

19:16.667 --> 19:17.959
Actually, I have

19:17.959 --> 19:20.792
It was a pleasure
catching up with you two.

19:20.792 --> 19:24.000
Oh, my God,
yes, such a pleasure.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.083
He said, "Nice talking
to you guys." (whimpers)

19:27.875 --> 19:28.917
Yup.

19:28.917 --> 19:32.500
Mr. Gamby walking
with a cane and shit.

19:32.500 --> 19:35.125
Man, you look
like Iceberg Slim.
Who's that?

19:35.125 --> 19:36.667
He was a pimp, man.

19:36.667 --> 19:39.000
A famous pimp.
He wrote like seven books.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.834
Well, I can assure you,
Dayshawn,

19:40.834 --> 19:42.458
My condition is
anything but pimp.

19:42.458 --> 19:45.625
I understand you're the one
who found my bullet-riddled
shot body.

19:45.625 --> 19:46.667
Yeah, I did, man.

19:46.667 --> 19:48.709
Blood leaking all over
the place and shit.

19:48.709 --> 19:50.250
I mean, most of it was blood.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.417
I think you might have used
the restroom on yourself, man.

19:52.417 --> 19:54.125
Front of your pants
was all warm and dark.

19:54.125 --> 19:56.083
Mm-mm. No, that was
sweat, Dayshawn.

19:56.083 --> 19:57.458
No, that was tee-tee, man.

19:57.458 --> 19:58.959
It was not tee-tee, Dayshawn.

19:58.959 --> 20:00.083
You ain't gotta be embarrassed.

20:00.083 --> 20:01.500
So what?
Your prostate went apeshit.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.917
Can we please
just move on from this?
Okay.

20:03.917 --> 20:05.250
What's the payback gonna be?

20:05.250 --> 20:06.542
The payback for what?

20:06.542 --> 20:07.583
You saved my life, Dayshawn.

20:07.583 --> 20:09.083
What do I gotta do
to pay you back? Name it.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.917
Oh, Mr. Gamby,
you don't owe me
nothing for that.

20:10.917 --> 20:14.458
I wasn't gonna leave
you out there bloody
and possibly full of piss.

20:14.458 --> 20:16.500
Well, I appreciate that,
Dayshawn. You're a true friend.

20:16.500 --> 20:17.792
But do owe you a debt

20:17.792 --> 20:19.917
and I like to make sure
that all my debts are clean.

20:19.917 --> 20:21.500
If you want to do
a brother a favor,

20:21.500 --> 20:23.667
you could let me duck out
a little bit early today.

20:23.667 --> 20:24.750
You can squirt out early.

20:24.750 --> 20:27.458
It's good to have you back, man.

20:27.458 --> 20:29.333
Now that we're totally square
for you saving my life,

20:29.333 --> 20:32.417
I'd like to ask you
a question, Dayshawn.
Okay.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.333
Where's Dr. Brown?

20:34.333 --> 20:36.208
I ain't got no idea, man.

20:36.208 --> 20:37.792
I was never really tight
with her like that.

20:37.792 --> 20:38.792
You guys weren't tight,

20:38.792 --> 20:40.667
you know, despite...
your similarities?

20:40.667 --> 20:43.041
You mean 'cause we both black?
Well, I didn't say that.

20:43.041 --> 20:44.500
Yeah, you did.
You said that.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.333
No, I didn't.
There was insinuation
somewhere in there.

20:46.333 --> 20:48.792
There was no insinuations,
but, yes, you were right.
It's true.

20:48.792 --> 20:50.834
That lady never spoke
a single word to me.

20:50.834 --> 20:54.667
She'd always send, um,
Ms. Swift in there
to talk to me.

20:55.667 --> 20:57.125
Ms. Swift?

I'm talking about.

her right-hand woman.

21:17.834 --> 21:19.250
I know she told you
where she went.

21:19.250 --> 21:20.667
You mean Dr. Brown?
Yeah.

21:20.667 --> 21:22.750
I haven't heard from her
since she skipped town.

21:22.750 --> 21:24.000

my friend here does not.
