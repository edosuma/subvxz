WEBVTT

00:04.520 --> 00:06.353
Longest ball wins.

00:06.355 --> 00:08.251
So, don't slice it again.

00:08.253 --> 00:09.597
Mulligan, Troy. You distracted me.

00:09.599 --> 00:10.845
Dad, maybe you need a new club.

00:10.847 --> 00:12.125
Or you should try

00:12.127 --> 00:13.393
- a different sport.
- Keep talking.

00:13.395 --> 00:14.461
You're almost up.

00:14.463 --> 00:16.062
There's a putt-putt down the street.

00:18.200 --> 00:20.567
And that's how it's done.

00:20.569 --> 00:22.536
That is gonna be tough to beat.

00:22.538 --> 00:24.029
This is fun. Thanks for coming.

00:24.031 --> 00:25.405
Feels like old times, you know?

00:25.407 --> 00:26.907
You used to love coming
here when you were nine.

00:26.909 --> 00:27.908
Yeah, I remember.

00:27.910 --> 00:29.009
I'm really glad we did this again.

00:29.011 --> 00:30.277
Yeah. All right, one more for me.

00:30.279 --> 00:31.378
Then you're up, hotshot.

00:31.380 --> 00:32.613
See if you can hit the river, Dad.

00:32.615 --> 00:33.814
All right.

00:36.619 --> 00:38.352
- Nice swing.
- Thanks.

00:38.354 --> 00:40.187
Order 17, Philly cheesesteak,

00:40.189 --> 00:41.488
fries, medium soda.

00:41.490 --> 00:43.724
Order 17, pick up, please.

00:50.666 --> 00:52.366
Troy?

00:54.236 --> 00:55.836
My God! He's killing him!

00:55.838 --> 00:56.838
Somebody stop him!

00:58.574 --> 01:00.307
Call 911!

01:00.309 --> 01:02.042
Need some help!

01:02.044 --> 01:04.278
Need a doctor! Anyone!

01:22.665 --> 01:23.997
What's this?

01:23.999 --> 01:25.032
What's it look like?

01:26.220 --> 01:28.669
A midlife crisis.

01:28.671 --> 01:31.038
I didn't question you
when you got a Bentley.

01:31.040 --> 01:34.941
Well, that's because my midlife
crisis came with air bags.

01:36.478 --> 01:39.346
I'm surprised you agreed to
do a psych eval on a patient.

01:39.348 --> 01:41.682
Well, she said that I
wouldn't want to pass it up

01:41.684 --> 01:42.883
and she knows me.

01:42.885 --> 01:44.884
She?

01:44.886 --> 01:46.433
Yeah, Dr. Levin.

01:46.722 --> 01:48.255
She handles the interesting patients.

01:48.257 --> 01:51.024
A man who mistook his wife
for a hat, that sort of thing.

01:51.026 --> 01:52.801
Hey, Bull,

01:53.629 --> 01:55.862
I know why you asked me
to meet you here today.

01:55.864 --> 01:57.264
Good. That saves time.

01:57.266 --> 01:58.398
I'm glad.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.200
I want you to know
that I heard what you said

02:00.202 --> 02:02.769
about my behavior
during the class action suit

02:03.449 --> 02:04.738
and you're right.

02:05.260 --> 02:06.807
I was off my game.

02:06.809 --> 02:09.576
But I'm back. And better.

02:09.578 --> 02:13.046
I'm just ready to jump
right back on that horse.

02:14.483 --> 02:16.721
Then why'd you buy a bike?

02:21.056 --> 02:22.723
Amy?

02:22.725 --> 02:25.726
Jason. And you must be Benny.

02:25.728 --> 02:28.061
Amy's the head of forensic psychiatry.

02:28.063 --> 02:29.229
Tough job.

02:29.231 --> 02:31.264
Given our country's
current mental state,

02:31.266 --> 02:32.766
I will never be out of work.

02:32.768 --> 02:34.568
How's the private sector treating you?

02:34.570 --> 02:35.884
I drive a Bentley.

02:36.565 --> 02:38.672
I hope you're still
finding time to bake.

02:38.674 --> 02:40.307
- Bull bakes?
- He doesn't know about.

02:40.309 --> 02:41.508
“Better than Robert Redford”?

02:41.510 --> 02:43.143
I do not.

02:43.145 --> 02:44.978
It's this amazing dessert
that Jason used to

02:44.980 --> 02:46.208
bring in on Fridays.

02:46.210 --> 02:47.835
Kind of half pie, half pudding.

02:47.837 --> 02:49.416
You know, my birthday's
coming up next month.

02:49.418 --> 02:51.051
I'm not baking you a cake.

02:51.053 --> 02:53.520
So, tell us about this patient of yours.

02:53.522 --> 02:56.623
Troy Dickerson is 25 years old.

02:56.625 --> 02:58.091
Graduated from NYU...

02:58.093 --> 03:00.427
good grades, popular, athletic.

03:00.429 --> 03:01.895
And then, a few months ago,

03:01.897 --> 03:03.730
he enrolled in the Lumansic Academy.

03:03.732 --> 03:05.499
Lumansic? I've heard of it.

03:05.501 --> 03:06.533
It's a cult.

03:06.535 --> 03:08.201
It's an alternative learning center.

03:08.203 --> 03:09.836
Yes. Which means it's a cult.

03:09.838 --> 03:12.606
How did Troy end up here?

03:12.608 --> 03:14.808
He was charged with murdering his father

03:14.810 --> 03:16.143
three nights ago.

03:16.145 --> 03:18.712
At his arraignment,
Troy plead not guilty.

03:18.714 --> 03:20.981
The judge ordered a
competency evaluation.

03:20.983 --> 03:21.923
Assessment?

03:21.925 --> 03:25.085
I think he thinks
he's telling the truth.

03:25.087 --> 03:27.120
There's just one problem.

03:29.458 --> 03:31.358
So, that's Troy.

03:31.360 --> 03:34.861
And that's his
father, Clint, at the tee.

03:34.863 --> 03:36.463
His demeanor shifted.

03:36.465 --> 03:38.064
I noticed it, too.

03:38.066 --> 03:39.800
He's dissociating.

03:41.637 --> 03:43.837
God.

03:44.652 --> 03:46.692
He attacked him out of nowhere.

03:47.075 --> 03:49.776
The head injuries
Clint sustained were fatal.

03:49.778 --> 03:52.312
I'm assuming Troy doesn't have
any memory of the incident.

03:52.314 --> 03:54.014
No, he doesn't.

03:54.016 --> 03:55.115
He's mentally blocked it.

03:55.117 --> 03:56.283
It may be

03:56.285 --> 03:58.151
psychologically damaging
for him to remember.

03:58.153 --> 04:02.155
We've done lie detector,
FMRI and several sessions.

04:02.157 --> 04:05.392
Look, whether
he claims to remember or not,

04:05.394 --> 04:07.260
it's obvious that he killed his father.

04:07.262 --> 04:09.563
What's not obvious is why.

04:09.565 --> 04:11.431
No history of violence.

04:12.334 --> 04:13.700
Has Troy seen the video?

04:13.702 --> 04:14.901
No.

04:16.920 --> 04:18.672
Anyone got a quarter?

04:19.475 --> 04:20.906
<i>Fun fact...</i>

04:20.909 --> 04:26.213
There are no U.S. quarters dated 1933.

04:27.475 --> 04:28.849
Okay.

04:28.851 --> 04:31.091
Maybe I oversold the “fun” part.

04:31.487 --> 04:34.087
But I'll bet you $20
you can't tell me the date

04:34.089 --> 04:35.455
on this quarter.

04:35.457 --> 04:37.457
How is this supposed to help me?

04:37.459 --> 04:39.059
Why are you here, Troy?

04:40.363 --> 04:42.027
They...

04:43.365 --> 04:45.565
say I killed my father.

04:45.567 --> 04:46.666
Did you?

04:46.668 --> 04:47.667
No.

04:47.669 --> 04:49.736
I would never do that.

04:49.738 --> 04:51.442
I loved my dad.

04:52.307 --> 04:56.076
So, you and Bull used to work together.

04:56.379 --> 04:58.138
Something like that.

04:59.114 --> 05:01.314
Just tell me the date on the quarter.

05:01.316 --> 05:03.650
I can't when it's spinning like that.

05:03.652 --> 05:06.620
Try. Look closer.

05:06.622 --> 05:09.756
It's an eye fixation induction.

05:09.758 --> 05:12.559
A way to test a person's
ability to transition

05:12.561 --> 05:15.629
into an altered mental state
of relaxation. -

05:16.548 --> 05:17.797
Just keep looking at it.

05:17.799 --> 05:18.965
In fact,

05:18.967 --> 05:21.067
look right through it.

05:21.729 --> 05:23.603
The longer you look at it,

05:23.605 --> 05:25.569
the more you can't look away.

05:26.008 --> 05:27.641
That's it.

05:27.643 --> 05:30.443
Keep focusing on the quarter.

05:32.681 --> 05:34.414
Tell me about your father.

05:35.551 --> 05:37.751
They say I killed him.

05:39.555 --> 05:41.555
But I don't remember.

05:41.557 --> 05:43.890
I want you to try.

05:43.892 --> 05:47.227
I have. Every day.

05:48.953 --> 05:50.764
It's gone.

05:53.135 --> 05:55.068
He's gone.

05:56.426 --> 05:58.238
Why can't I remember?

05:59.601 --> 06:01.474
What's wrong with me?

06:06.395 --> 06:09.062
We're gonna figure this out... together.

06:12.321 --> 06:14.120
What do you think?

06:15.023 --> 06:16.510
We're taking this case.

06:16.512 --> 06:18.592
I thought you were just
evaluating him, Bull.

06:18.594 --> 06:20.093
You saw the video. He did it.

06:20.095 --> 06:21.461
What I saw on that video

06:21.463 --> 06:23.463
confirms what I saw in that room:

06:23.465 --> 06:27.567
A young man who is highly
susceptible to hypnotism

06:27.569 --> 06:28.802
and verbal triggers.

06:28.804 --> 06:31.071
Troy is not guilty of this crime.

06:31.073 --> 06:33.781
He was brainwashed to kill.

06:33.783 --> 06:40.751
Synced & corrected by -robtor-

06:41.632 --> 06:44.357
You are getting very sleepy.

06:45.222 --> 06:47.269
Your screen's filthy and
it smells like peanut butter.

06:47.271 --> 06:49.766
Come on, concentrate.
I paid 99 cents for this app.

06:49.768 --> 06:51.884
Okay, hypnosis doesn't work.

06:51.909 --> 06:53.142
Yes, it does work.

06:53.144 --> 06:55.561
I know that it can be used
to stop smoking

06:55.586 --> 06:57.220
or lose weight, but murder?

06:57.221 --> 06:59.588
I saw a hypnotist at a
magic show once, and he told me

06:59.590 --> 07:01.257
no one'll ever do anything
that they don't want to do.

07:01.259 --> 07:03.158
And that is why
we don't base our defense

07:03.160 --> 07:04.593
on magic shows, Cable.

07:04.595 --> 07:06.729
The human mind is pliable.

07:06.731 --> 07:09.565
And what we want can be manipulated

07:09.567 --> 07:11.967
depending on the vulnerability
of the subject

07:11.969 --> 07:13.969
and the skills of the hypnotist.

07:13.971 --> 07:15.070
So, what's our strategy?

07:15.072 --> 07:17.139
I say let's try to plead
down to manslaughter.

07:17.141 --> 07:18.507
No.

07:18.509 --> 07:20.643
Troy Dickerson isn't responsible
for killing his father.

07:20.645 --> 07:22.211
He was psychologically kidnapped.

07:22.213 --> 07:25.447
We will plead not guilty
by reason of insanity.

07:25.449 --> 07:27.850
But Troy has no history of insanity.

07:27.852 --> 07:29.418
I mean, he's not insane, is he?

07:29.420 --> 07:30.619
Temporarily.

07:30.621 --> 07:32.321
To prove insanity, all we have to do

07:32.323 --> 07:34.590
is show that Troy was not
in control of his actions

07:34.592 --> 07:36.492
- at the time of the crime.
- I don't know.

07:36.494 --> 07:38.794
Juries aren't gonna look at Troy
and think he's insane.

07:38.796 --> 07:42.031
And they will see him kill
his father in cold blood.

07:42.033 --> 07:43.632
It's gonna be impossible
to convince them

07:43.634 --> 07:44.933
that Troy's not responsible.

07:44.935 --> 07:46.969
Troy was in an altered state
when he killed his father.

07:46.971 --> 07:48.771
He had no idea what he was doing.

07:48.773 --> 07:52.574
The person who hypnotized him
is responsible.

07:52.576 --> 07:56.078
So, someone just told him
to commit murder at 6:41 p.m.?

07:56.080 --> 07:59.014
There was a trigger, a word,

07:59.016 --> 08:01.116
a sound, a color,

08:01.118 --> 08:02.251
an object.

08:02.253 --> 08:04.286
Cable and Benny,
I'd like you to break down

08:04.288 --> 08:06.622
everything that Troy
came into contact with.

08:07.053 --> 08:08.457
We find the trigger,

08:08.459 --> 08:11.193
we find the real killer.

08:12.563 --> 08:13.929
Hey, Bull?

08:13.931 --> 08:16.565
So, who do you have in mind
for a defense lawyer?

08:16.567 --> 08:18.334
Are you curious or campaigning?

08:18.336 --> 08:19.501
Both.

08:19.503 --> 08:20.803
Sorry I'm late.

08:20.805 --> 08:22.571
Benny, you remember Reed Kenwood.

08:22.573 --> 08:25.140
Yeah. The, medical marijuana case.
Yes.

08:25.142 --> 08:26.942
You guys really nailed
the strategy on that one,

08:26.944 --> 08:28.477
but this...

08:28.479 --> 08:30.612
I've always wanted to try
an insanity defense.

08:30.614 --> 08:32.174
- Good.
- Reed, welcome.

08:32.177 --> 08:34.014
We're just getting started
on the juror profiles.

08:34.015 --> 08:35.017
Excuse me.

08:35.019 --> 08:36.051
Have fun.

08:36.053 --> 08:39.020
Reed? Really?

08:39.023 --> 08:41.789
Yeah. He's worked for us
in the past and frankly,

08:41.792 --> 08:44.126
we need to put a believer
in front of this jury.

08:44.128 --> 08:47.162
What makes you think
that Reed believes in hypnosis?

08:47.164 --> 08:49.131
What makes you think
I'm talking about hypnosis?

08:50.013 --> 08:52.101
Well, if not that, then what?

08:52.103 --> 08:54.203
I don't think you're really back yet.

08:54.205 --> 08:58.240
I'll give you a call when
we're representing a biker gang.

09:07.551 --> 09:10.519
Troy and his dad have been
coming here since he was a kid.

09:10.521 --> 09:11.887
I have no idea what got into him.

09:11.889 --> 09:13.288
Those cameras...

09:13.290 --> 09:14.490
did they record the murder?

09:14.492 --> 09:16.525
Yeah, but they all show the same thing.

09:16.527 --> 09:18.060
Troy killed his father with a four iron.

09:18.062 --> 09:19.461
Is anyone disputing that?

09:19.463 --> 09:22.030
Kind of. Would you mind sharing

09:22.032 --> 09:23.499
a copy of all the footage?

09:23.501 --> 09:25.968
Sorry, man. I don't know you, so,

09:25.970 --> 09:27.436
not without a warrant.

09:27.438 --> 09:29.436
Come on. I'm trying to help Troy.

09:29.438 --> 09:31.143
The police were only given one angle.

09:31.145 --> 09:33.442
We're looking for a potential trigger

09:33.444 --> 09:35.778
or something that may have set Troy off.

09:35.780 --> 09:38.447
These different camera angles
may help explain what happened.

09:38.449 --> 09:40.149
Yeah, which means you can come back

09:40.151 --> 09:43.018
with a warrant. Excuse me.

09:43.020 --> 09:45.354
That computer's not password protected.

09:45.356 --> 09:47.489
I can get the footage
in less than 60 seconds.

09:47.491 --> 09:49.391
Just cover me, partner.

09:49.393 --> 09:51.193
Okay.

09:52.696 --> 09:54.414
- Anything else?
- Yes.

09:54.416 --> 09:57.065
While I'm here, I might as well
get a few swings in.

09:57.067 --> 09:58.852
Would you mind setting me up?

10:00.070 --> 10:01.270
Okay.

10:23.160 --> 10:24.126
For you...

10:24.128 --> 10:25.360
That should do it.

10:26.597 --> 10:27.896
Come on.

10:27.898 --> 10:29.231
- Yeah, it's nice.
- All right, anything else?

10:29.233 --> 10:30.332
- Hey, thank you.
- You good?

10:30.334 --> 10:31.433
Thank you.

10:31.435 --> 10:32.601
W-wait, wait.

10:32.603 --> 10:35.871
Where do I get the balls?

10:38.609 --> 10:39.842
Come on.

10:44.682 --> 10:45.881
You get it?

10:46.550 --> 10:48.016
Ace in the hole.

10:48.819 --> 10:49.818
Don't be offended,

10:49.820 --> 10:51.487
but I'm taking the subway back to work.

10:51.489 --> 10:53.689
Come on, you know you liked
being on the back of my bike.

10:53.691 --> 10:55.131
Yeah, as long as you're not driving.

10:56.160 --> 10:59.962
<i>I am so proud of each
and every one of you.</i>

10:59.964 --> 11:01.864
You have taken the first step

11:01.866 --> 11:04.399
on a long and luminous journey

11:04.401 --> 11:06.101
towards realizing your potential.

11:06.103 --> 11:09.471
I'm Thornton Grey.

11:09.473 --> 11:11.673
Founder of the Lumansic Academy.

11:11.675 --> 11:13.375
My daughter Rachel

11:13.377 --> 11:16.812
and I started this learning
center two years ago

11:16.814 --> 11:19.645
with one goal in mind:

11:20.705 --> 11:21.777
You.

11:21.779 --> 11:23.352
That's right.

11:23.354 --> 11:25.387
Yes, all of you, because, here,

11:25.389 --> 11:27.222
we're all family.

11:27.224 --> 11:28.824
Seriously?

11:28.826 --> 11:30.392
This guy's a talking fortune cookie.

11:30.394 --> 11:32.327
No, I see the appeal.

11:32.329 --> 11:34.897
Well, he's passionate,
he oozes charisma.

11:34.899 --> 11:37.474
And he puts on a great presentation.

11:38.102 --> 11:40.135
You're not really buying
into this nonsense, are you?

11:40.137 --> 11:43.238
What matters is that
Troy bought into it.

11:43.240 --> 11:45.207
- That's why we're here.
- Right.

11:45.209 --> 11:47.643
Now how does that sound to everybody?

11:51.215 --> 11:52.915
Hi, Benny.

11:52.917 --> 11:54.082
Hi, Amy.

11:55.063 --> 11:57.586
- Is Dr. Bull around?
- He stepped out.

11:57.588 --> 11:59.187
He'll be back soon.

12:00.024 --> 12:01.924
Cruiser or sport bike?

12:01.926 --> 12:04.092
Sport bike.

12:04.094 --> 12:05.427
You know your motorcycles.

12:05.429 --> 12:08.363
My ex-husband
used to restore old Harleys.

12:08.365 --> 12:10.299
Good memories...

12:10.301 --> 12:12.301
of the bikes.

12:12.303 --> 12:16.104
My husband, well,
try to forget him every day.

12:16.106 --> 12:19.541
So, you and Bull started
dating after the divorce.

12:19.543 --> 12:23.011
You thought that Jason and I...? No.

12:23.013 --> 12:25.547
Our relationship has
always been professional.

12:26.684 --> 12:27.716
I'm sorry.

12:27.718 --> 12:28.817
I, misread that.

12:28.819 --> 12:30.886
I can see why you
and Dr. Bull get along.

12:30.888 --> 12:32.821
You're very quick with deductions.

12:33.515 --> 12:35.891
I can see why you
and Dr. Bull are friends.

12:35.893 --> 12:38.036
Always observing.

12:41.298 --> 12:42.798
Are those part of the Dickerson case?

12:42.800 --> 12:45.000
Yes.

12:45.002 --> 12:46.335
These are drawings Troy made.

12:47.938 --> 12:49.338
Looks like a trident.

12:50.174 --> 12:51.173
He also made these.

12:51.175 --> 12:53.108
When did he start doing this?

12:53.110 --> 12:55.577
Right after you and Bull
came to see him.

12:55.579 --> 12:57.512
You think it's got something
to do with his father's murder?

12:57.514 --> 12:58.480
Yes.

12:58.482 --> 13:00.048
Problem is

13:00.050 --> 13:02.050
Troy doesn't know
what these drawings mean.

13:02.052 --> 13:05.487
It's what we call
“a glitch in the matrix.”

13:06.047 --> 13:08.390
It occurs when somebody
has been programmed

13:08.392 --> 13:09.891
to forget an event,

13:09.893 --> 13:13.829
but their mind is desperately
trying to remember.

13:17.635 --> 13:19.568
So, I've reviewed
the surveillance footage

13:19.570 --> 13:21.103
from Chelsea Piers, and in the minutes

13:21.105 --> 13:23.271
leading up to the murder,
I don't see Troy talk to anybody

13:23.273 --> 13:24.506
but his father.

13:24.508 --> 13:25.974
See if this triggers anything.

13:28.445 --> 13:30.045
A trident.

13:30.047 --> 13:32.514
Like the spear of Poseidon?

13:33.817 --> 13:35.017
The gum?

13:35.986 --> 13:39.087
- The missile.
- Let's... try to narrow it down

13:39.089 --> 13:41.289
to things relevant to Troy's life.

13:41.291 --> 13:43.191
Well, maybe Troy's secretly
the god of the sea

13:43.193 --> 13:44.993
who enjoys fresh breath
and nuclear-armed

13:44.995 --> 13:46.862
submarine-launched ballistic weapons.

13:47.698 --> 13:49.297
Follow that lead last.

13:51.419 --> 13:53.368
Our biggest challenge will
be to convince the jurors

13:53.370 --> 13:55.137
that hypnotism is real.

13:55.139 --> 13:58.240
So... how do we do that?

13:58.242 --> 13:59.441
We hypnotize them.

13:59.443 --> 14:02.444
Wait, you're suggesting we
actually hypnotize them?

14:02.446 --> 14:03.578
I'm suggesting

14:03.580 --> 14:05.380
the power of suggestion.

14:06.116 --> 14:07.816
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

14:07.818 --> 14:09.618
as part of the voir dire process,

14:09.620 --> 14:12.888
I'm hoping you all can...
help settle a debate

14:12.890 --> 14:14.389
I'm having with my girlfriend.

14:15.592 --> 14:17.225
Think they'll buy this?

14:17.227 --> 14:19.127
Maybe not the girlfriend part.

14:20.083 --> 14:23.865
She says this candle
smells like vanilla.

14:23.867 --> 14:26.034
I think it smells like sandalwood.

14:26.036 --> 14:27.736
What do you think?

14:29.673 --> 14:31.573
Um, I'm not really sure.

14:33.177 --> 14:34.624
Ma'am, what about you?

14:37.948 --> 14:39.347
Vanilla.

14:39.349 --> 14:40.882
Definitely vanilla, right?

14:42.820 --> 14:44.553
Yeah, she's right, it's vanilla.

14:45.923 --> 14:48.190
Jurors four and five are keepers.

14:48.192 --> 14:49.624
It's unscented.

14:49.626 --> 14:50.926
Neither vanilla...

14:51.862 --> 14:53.128
nor sandalwood.

14:53.130 --> 14:55.363
The power of suggestion.

14:55.365 --> 14:57.599
How many of you own a gun?

14:59.169 --> 15:01.002
Prosecution wants gun owners

15:01.004 --> 15:03.038
because, statistically,
they're tough on crime,

15:03.040 --> 15:05.140
but if we set the narrative right,

15:05.142 --> 15:07.476
gun owners will sympathize with Troy.

15:07.478 --> 15:09.745
And they'll see him as the gun,

15:09.747 --> 15:11.580
and the person who hypnotized him

15:11.582 --> 15:13.081
as the one who pulled the trigger.

15:13.083 --> 15:15.650
'Cause gun owners don't blame the gun.

15:17.488 --> 15:19.287
Yeah. Stop smiling.

15:19.289 --> 15:21.490
All five jurors are acceptable
to the prosecution.

15:23.427 --> 15:24.760
Acceptable to the defense.

15:35.572 --> 15:36.571
Hello, there.

15:36.573 --> 15:38.306
Oatmeal.

15:38.308 --> 15:39.441
Good choice.

15:39.443 --> 15:41.176
I'm feeling very confident about it.

15:41.178 --> 15:44.913
Are you always
confident about your choices?

15:44.915 --> 15:47.582
If every choice were as easy as this...

15:47.584 --> 15:49.284
But they can be,

15:49.286 --> 15:52.220
once you're at peace with who you are.

15:53.991 --> 15:57.192
I guess I've made a few
left turns along the way.

15:57.194 --> 15:59.895
Who hasn't? Right.

15:59.897 --> 16:02.898
You do seem a little restless.

16:02.900 --> 16:04.933
Have you changed careers recently?

16:04.935 --> 16:06.234
Yeah.

16:06.236 --> 16:07.236
Yeah, I have.

16:08.272 --> 16:09.871
I started out in sports

16:09.873 --> 16:11.473
and then moved into
the fashion industry,

16:11.475 --> 16:14.976
and now I mostly consult
on other people's appearance.

16:14.978 --> 16:15.977
Appearance?

16:15.979 --> 16:17.245
What you see on the outside

16:17.247 --> 16:20.749
versus what's really
going on inside?

16:21.585 --> 16:23.251
Yeah.

16:23.863 --> 16:26.655
I'd like to understand
what that means to you.

16:27.791 --> 16:31.159
Excuse me? You're,
you're Rachel, right?

16:31.161 --> 16:32.127
Yes. Hi.

16:32.129 --> 16:33.628
Hi, I was in the audience

16:33.630 --> 16:35.363
for your dad's speech.

16:35.365 --> 16:37.399
It was so good, and...

16:37.401 --> 16:39.134
I'm submitting an application.

16:39.136 --> 16:42.304
Well, we love hearing that.

16:42.306 --> 16:44.706
You know, this place isn't
at all what I thought.

16:44.708 --> 16:45.774
What were you expecting?

16:45.776 --> 16:47.342
Well, you know, all that
stuff online about...

16:47.344 --> 16:48.844
about Lumansic being a cult.

16:48.846 --> 16:52.047
And that guy killing his father.

16:52.049 --> 16:54.416
- Troy, yes.
- Did you, did you know him?

16:54.418 --> 16:55.884
I did.

16:55.886 --> 16:57.285
And I really liked him.

16:57.287 --> 16:59.721
My dad and I oversee all the
first-year students ourselves,

16:59.723 --> 17:03.558
and Dad saw something
really special in Troy.

17:03.560 --> 17:05.327
He was trying to help him.

17:05.329 --> 17:07.395
Never mind all the news.

17:07.396 --> 17:08.663
They just want to sell stories.

17:08.665 --> 17:10.665
Here, we zone all of that out

17:10.666 --> 17:12.867
and try to make ourselves better people.

17:14.104 --> 17:15.560
What do you do?

17:16.720 --> 17:18.440
So, Mr. Grey's daughter said that

17:18.442 --> 17:20.075
he took a particular
interest in our client.

17:20.077 --> 17:22.743
Thornton is the kind of guy
that takes an interest

17:22.746 --> 17:23.979
in everyone.

17:23.981 --> 17:25.079
“Thornton”?

17:25.082 --> 17:26.647
You spoke with him?

17:26.650 --> 17:29.017
Yeah, on my tour.

17:29.019 --> 17:31.319
You-You got a tour? They...

17:31.321 --> 17:33.121
they told me I'd have
to call to schedule one.

17:34.024 --> 17:35.983
- Weird.
- More like rude.

17:35.985 --> 17:37.859
They lied to me.

17:37.861 --> 17:39.361
Hot date?

17:39.363 --> 17:41.029
Indeed. Lumansic.

17:41.866 --> 17:45.066
Thornton wants me to come
to the orientation class tomorrow.

17:45.068 --> 17:46.201
They are totally recruiting him.

17:46.203 --> 17:47.903
And they're not giving
me the time of day.

17:47.905 --> 17:49.504
Danny, they got a whiff
of your skepticism,

17:49.506 --> 17:50.972
and they don't want to take any chances.

17:50.974 --> 17:53.541
And, Chunk, they saw you as open-minded

17:53.543 --> 17:54.509
and inquisitive.

17:54.511 --> 17:56.278
They like the cut of your jib.

17:56.280 --> 17:57.714
Thank you?

17:57.716 --> 18:00.148
Congratulations, you're joining a cult.

18:00.150 --> 18:02.651
Now, please don't kill us.

18:09.566 --> 18:11.833
Okay, Reed, all set to go?

18:11.835 --> 18:13.601
But I thought Benny was...

18:13.603 --> 18:17.083
I'm gonna deliver the opening
to our mock jury.

18:17.674 --> 18:19.760
Test out our theory about Thornton Grey.

18:19.768 --> 18:20.968
Reed's trying the case.

18:20.970 --> 18:22.136
Mock courtroom is my domain.

18:22.138 --> 18:23.337
Let me take a shot.

18:23.339 --> 18:25.506
Okay, show me.

18:32.248 --> 18:35.149
Now, these facts
aren't in dispute, right?

18:35.151 --> 18:38.863
You don't have to decide whether
or not Troy killed his father.

18:39.030 --> 18:41.988
But you do have to decide whether or not

18:41.990 --> 18:45.664
he lacked the ability
to control his actions

18:45.689 --> 18:46.689
during the incident.

18:47.385 --> 18:50.024
We're gonna prove that Troy

18:50.026 --> 18:53.895
was manipulated to kill
his father by Thornton Grey,

18:54.556 --> 18:58.066
the leader of a cult camouflaged

18:58.068 --> 19:00.468
as an elite institution
for higher education.

19:00.921 --> 19:03.871
Where former students
reported being subjected to

19:03.873 --> 19:05.649
ritual indoctrination.

19:05.651 --> 19:07.976
Where they were encouraged
to cut off family ties,

19:07.978 --> 19:10.499
and attended hypnotherapy sessions

19:10.501 --> 19:12.246
to control their behavior.

19:12.248 --> 19:15.147
The mock jurors' readings spiked
when Benny mentioned the tactics

19:15.149 --> 19:16.833
that Lumansic has been using.

19:16.835 --> 19:18.553
But that is the good news.

19:18.555 --> 19:19.654
And the bad news?

19:19.656 --> 19:21.624
Even though the jurors
believe that Thornton Grey

19:21.626 --> 19:24.287
had the skill and opportunity
to hypnotize Troy,

19:24.289 --> 19:25.727
they don't yet believe
he had ample motive

19:25.729 --> 19:27.057
to kill Troy's father.

19:27.059 --> 19:28.629
Yeah, I may have a lead on that.

19:28.631 --> 19:30.264
So, I looked into Troy's
father's bank records

19:30.266 --> 19:32.333
and it turns out he was,
he was paying

19:32.335 --> 19:35.937
for Troy's tuition at Lumansic
to the tune of 25 grand.

19:35.939 --> 19:37.005
Maybe his dad threatened

19:37.007 --> 19:38.206
to cut off the payments.

19:38.208 --> 19:40.096
I mean, Thornton would've
lost a lot of money.

19:40.520 --> 19:41.697
Money is a motive for murder.

19:41.722 --> 19:43.055
Troy was one student;

19:43.057 --> 19:45.090
His tuition wasn't gonna
make or break the school.

19:45.092 --> 19:46.258
Just keep digging.

19:50.071 --> 19:51.363
Patty Hearst.

19:51.365 --> 19:52.798
Big day.

19:52.800 --> 19:55.768
Actually, I was thinking
more Donnie Brasco.

19:55.770 --> 19:58.037
How you want me to play this
when I go in?

19:58.039 --> 20:01.240
Well, don't overthink it;
You were chosen for a reason.

20:01.242 --> 20:03.809
Cults, like Lumansic, target people

20:03.811 --> 20:05.311
who are searching for meaning.

20:05.313 --> 20:06.545
Some people are curious,

20:06.547 --> 20:10.063
others have... lost direction
in their lives.

20:11.069 --> 20:13.352
They can be very seductive, Chunk.

20:13.354 --> 20:15.421
You think I'm gonna go native?

20:15.423 --> 20:17.456
Come on, Bull.

20:20.461 --> 20:22.361
It's not about intelligence.

20:22.940 --> 20:25.297
Brilliant minds are co-opted
by cults all the time.

20:25.299 --> 20:26.365
Just be yourself in there,

20:26.367 --> 20:28.033
they're not gonna suspect anything.

20:28.035 --> 20:30.336
I need you inside their practices.

20:30.338 --> 20:32.438
And I want to know the
techniques that they use

20:32.440 --> 20:33.439
on their students.

20:33.441 --> 20:34.440
Keep your eyes open...

20:34.442 --> 20:36.876
every small detail... because

20:36.878 --> 20:39.678
the more specific we can be
with the jury, the better.

20:39.680 --> 20:41.280
And do not...

20:41.282 --> 20:43.148
Drink the Kool-Aid.

20:43.150 --> 20:44.617
Danny already beat you to it.

20:45.820 --> 20:48.888
I was gonna say,
“Do not be late for orientation,”

20:48.890 --> 20:50.256
but, wow.

20:50.258 --> 20:52.679
I thought Danny would be
more proud of her rejection.

20:54.562 --> 20:57.029
This band's called Trident Four,

20:57.031 --> 20:58.964
I found them in Troy's music library.

20:58.966 --> 21:01.166
Do they know “tri” means three,
not four?

21:01.168 --> 21:04.336
They're pretty post-hipster,
grunge antiestablishment,

21:04.338 --> 21:06.472
so I'd say it's unclear
whether they're being ironic

21:06.474 --> 21:07.673
or idiotic.

21:07.675 --> 21:09.341
Wow. Let's hear it.

21:09.343 --> 21:10.676
Okay.

21:16.751 --> 21:18.217
Interesting, right?

21:21.589 --> 21:22.855
Any indication Troy
was listening to this

21:22.857 --> 21:24.056
on the night of the murder?

21:24.058 --> 21:25.057
Unfortunately not,

21:25.059 --> 21:26.425
but it's the best lead I have.

21:26.427 --> 21:27.860
I mean, I've checked all his records.

21:27.862 --> 21:30.095
He's not a fan of <i> The Little Mermaid.</i>

21:30.097 --> 21:31.797
<i>The Little Mermaid,</i> like, King Triton?

21:31.799 --> 21:33.365
Yeah, he carried a trident.

21:33.367 --> 21:35.167
That's so cool
that you know King Triton.

21:35.169 --> 21:37.736
I was Ariel when I was a kid,
for Halloween.

21:37.738 --> 21:38.804
Me, too.

21:38.806 --> 21:40.139
We should totally have a sing-along.

21:40.141 --> 21:41.440
Yeah, you know,

21:41.442 --> 21:43.409
I'm, I'm busy tonight. Um...

21:43.411 --> 21:44.710
Yeah.

21:44.712 --> 21:46.745
Okay, well, what about, like, Tuesday?

21:46.747 --> 21:48.314
- Busy.
- Wednesday?

21:48.316 --> 21:49.648
Still busy.

21:50.484 --> 21:52.618
Chunk.

21:52.620 --> 21:54.386
So glad you've joined us.

21:54.388 --> 21:55.754
Thank you.

21:55.756 --> 21:57.690
I'm gonna need your cell phone.

21:57.692 --> 21:59.525
My phone, why?

21:59.527 --> 22:02.479
You'll get it back at
the end of the session.

22:04.391 --> 22:08.200
Sorry about the,
heightened security.

22:08.202 --> 22:10.603
She's concerned about the negative press

22:10.605 --> 22:12.004
we've been getting.

22:12.006 --> 22:14.206
She wants to open a second
campus in Brooklyn.

22:14.208 --> 22:16.809
Wow. That'd be amazing.

22:16.811 --> 22:18.978
It has its pros and cons.

22:18.980 --> 22:21.547
I never want to lose sight
of our mission here.

22:21.549 --> 22:25.050
You know, something I
carefully manage is being sure

22:25.052 --> 22:27.486
that I can devote ample time
to each new student.

22:27.488 --> 22:28.768
I certainly appreciate the time.

22:29.991 --> 22:32.257
I've been thinking about
something you said yesterday,

22:32.259 --> 22:34.927
about appearances.

22:34.929 --> 22:36.929
I believe I can help you.

22:36.931 --> 22:39.098
Really. How?

22:39.100 --> 22:41.433
Techniques that allow people

22:41.435 --> 22:43.035
to access parts of their subconscious

22:43.037 --> 22:45.471
that've been holding them back

22:45.473 --> 22:47.473
from truly knowing who they are

22:47.475 --> 22:49.775
and what they want.

22:50.211 --> 22:51.477
Chunk.

22:52.087 --> 22:55.047
Have you ever been hypnotized?

22:57.184 --> 22:59.551
Me? Testify?

22:59.553 --> 23:01.220
It's possible.

23:03.190 --> 23:05.357
But I don't remember anything.

23:05.359 --> 23:07.292
The jury needs to see
that you're a regular kid

23:07.294 --> 23:10.162
who had his whole life ahead of him.

23:10.164 --> 23:11.730
Until someone did this to you.

23:12.111 --> 23:13.671
Are they gonna show the video?

23:14.361 --> 23:16.568
Of me hitting my dad?

23:17.000 --> 23:18.504
They will.

23:18.506 --> 23:24.410
My memories of me and my dad
are... playing baseball,

23:24.412 --> 23:25.678
hiking together.

23:25.680 --> 23:29.581
He was my coach, and he
was always there for me.

23:29.583 --> 23:31.984
How do I explain

23:33.240 --> 23:36.021
hurting the man who loved me
most in this world?

23:36.023 --> 23:38.157
I'm here to help you get through this.

23:38.159 --> 23:40.926
But you have to help me understand

23:40.928 --> 23:42.394
what you've gone through.

23:43.023 --> 23:44.997
Let's start with,

23:44.999 --> 23:47.633
what was your attraction to Lumansic?

23:47.635 --> 23:51.681
Lumansic taught me how to look inward.

23:52.086 --> 23:54.317
Find meaning in the here and now,

23:54.319 --> 23:57.265
stop trying to search for
things I'll never find.

23:59.180 --> 24:00.345
Your stepmother mentioned

24:00.347 --> 24:03.215
that your mom left
when you were quite young.

24:03.217 --> 24:06.418
Yeah, I don't even remember
what she looked like.

24:06.420 --> 24:09.188
My dad refused to show me photos.

24:10.791 --> 24:15.060
Lumansic helped me realize
that, deep down,

24:15.062 --> 24:17.096
I resented him for that.

24:17.511 --> 24:18.731
Enough to kill him?

24:19.182 --> 24:21.033
Of course not.

24:21.035 --> 24:23.135
He was my dad.

24:23.137 --> 24:25.487
And now he's gone.

24:30.746 --> 24:32.911
I can't believe this is happening.

24:34.316 --> 24:37.249
I wasn't even supposed
to be with my dad that night.

24:38.452 --> 24:40.452
Where were you supposed to be?

24:40.454 --> 24:42.755
In a session with Thornton.

24:42.757 --> 24:45.324
Dad wanted to go to Chelsea Piers.

24:45.326 --> 24:47.226
It was a tradition of ours.

24:49.597 --> 24:52.331
If I'd just said no...

24:52.333 --> 24:53.499
Troy.

24:55.040 --> 24:56.869
It's gonna be okay.

24:58.584 --> 25:01.173
Troy had a private session with Thornton

25:01.175 --> 25:05.511
every Thursday night
at 6:00 p.m., except that night.

25:05.513 --> 25:07.279
A last-minute cancellation.

25:07.281 --> 25:10.916
I-It is possible that whoever
hypnotized Troy to kill

25:10.918 --> 25:12.926
didn't know about the change in plans.

25:13.721 --> 25:16.121
Maybe Troy wasn't
supposed to kill his dad.

25:16.705 --> 25:19.291
And maybe Thornton wasn't
the killer after all.

25:19.293 --> 25:21.527
No, he wasn't.

25:23.130 --> 25:25.330
He was the target.

25:29.280 --> 25:30.952
Troy shouldn't have been with his father

25:30.977 --> 25:32.143
the night of the murder.

25:32.145 --> 25:33.978
He had a standing appointment
with Thornton Grey

25:33.980 --> 25:35.079
at that exact time.

25:35.081 --> 25:36.147
Someone wants Thornton dead?

25:36.149 --> 25:37.482
We should warn him.

25:37.484 --> 25:39.951
I see your session went well
with Dear Leader.

25:39.953 --> 25:42.287
Now we know he's not the killer,
and frankly I think Lumansic

25:42.289 --> 25:43.421
has gotten a bad rap.

25:44.423 --> 25:46.483
My God, you totally
drank the Kool-Aid.

25:46.485 --> 25:48.460
Chunk, right now this is just a theory.

25:48.462 --> 25:50.462
We don't want you blowing
your cover at Lumansic.

25:50.464 --> 25:51.763
We need evidence.

25:52.266 --> 25:53.364
Our insanity defense relies

25:53.366 --> 25:56.734
on the jury accepting
that Troy was hypnotized

25:56.736 --> 25:59.604
and someone else
was in control of his actions.

26:00.470 --> 26:02.707
That means they're gonna have
to understand how and why

26:02.709 --> 26:04.042
hypnosis works.

26:04.044 --> 26:06.811
And they're gonna need to hear
from an expert. Marissa?

26:06.813 --> 26:09.180
Have Benny prep Amy.

26:14.821 --> 26:17.021
Chunk, about Lumansic.
I'm headed there now.

26:17.023 --> 26:18.223
Yeah, I don't think you should.

26:18.225 --> 26:20.391
Because I disagree with
your assessment of Thornton?

26:20.393 --> 26:22.293
- No. Chunk, I...
- Look, I appreciate your concern,

26:22.295 --> 26:23.595
but I can handle this.

26:23.597 --> 26:25.227
- Right. What I'm trying to...
- Bull.

26:25.229 --> 26:26.764
Trust me.

26:29.536 --> 26:32.144
So the prosecution will ask, Dr. Levin,

26:32.146 --> 26:33.571
what makes you qualified

26:33.573 --> 26:34.839
to evaluate Troy Dickerson?

26:34.841 --> 26:36.674
I've evaluated over a thousand cases

26:36.676 --> 26:38.710
for both the criminal and civil courts.

26:38.712 --> 26:40.411
Have you ever been wrong
about a patient?

26:40.413 --> 26:42.280
Yes.

26:42.282 --> 26:43.748
How do you live with knowing

26:43.750 --> 26:45.016
that a choice you made

26:45.018 --> 26:47.552
had unintended consequences
on someone's life?

26:47.554 --> 26:49.675
I suppose you have to step back

26:50.077 --> 26:51.856
and think about
why you were in that position

26:51.858 --> 26:53.358
in the first place.

26:53.360 --> 26:55.680
Most likely it's because
you've earned the right

26:55.682 --> 26:57.786
to make certain judgment calls.

26:57.788 --> 27:00.231
And the right to make mistakes.

27:00.233 --> 27:02.978
Honest mistakes.

27:03.988 --> 27:05.970
Life-changing mistakes, nonetheless.

27:06.371 --> 27:09.207
Is everything all right, Benny?

27:10.099 --> 27:11.776
Yeah.

27:11.778 --> 27:13.219
Yeah.

27:14.547 --> 27:16.948
Bull thinks I lost faith in myself.

27:16.950 --> 27:18.449
Why would he think that?

27:19.992 --> 27:21.586
I'm sorry, I...

27:21.588 --> 27:22.654
I got off track.

27:22.656 --> 27:23.988
Let-Let-Let's get back to prep.

27:23.990 --> 27:26.357
I'd love to take you to dinner tonight.

27:26.782 --> 27:28.793
Amy, I...

27:28.795 --> 27:31.162
I just got out of a relationship.

27:31.692 --> 27:32.997
I think you're amazing,

27:32.999 --> 27:34.599
but I'm not ready to jump
back into something.

27:34.601 --> 27:35.967
Benny.

27:35.969 --> 27:37.468
I think you've gotten the wrong idea

27:37.470 --> 27:40.138
about why Jason suggested we connect.

27:43.107 --> 27:45.043
Apparently, I have a new therapist.

27:45.045 --> 27:46.311
Good for you.

27:46.313 --> 27:47.612
Bull, you crossed the line.

27:47.614 --> 27:49.314
What was I supposed to do?

27:49.316 --> 27:51.015
You're spiraling

27:51.017 --> 27:53.117
and you're certainly
not opening up to me.

27:53.119 --> 27:54.452
So you hire me a shrink?

27:54.454 --> 27:56.454
I wouldn't say “hired.”

27:56.456 --> 27:57.989
I'm paying her in baked goods.

27:57.991 --> 28:00.692
Don't joke. This is my life
we're talking about here.

28:00.694 --> 28:02.293
And it's affecting your work

28:02.295 --> 28:03.589
and my work.

28:04.388 --> 28:05.496
What do you want?

28:05.828 --> 28:09.167
Want me to admit that,
that, that I slept with Erin?

28:09.169 --> 28:10.735
Okay, I slept with Erin, all right?

28:10.737 --> 28:12.770
I... I slept with Erin.

28:12.772 --> 28:14.806
And, yes, she was our client.

28:14.808 --> 28:17.041
It was a mistake and now it's over.

28:17.043 --> 28:18.176
We good?

28:18.178 --> 28:19.844
Not until you're ready to admit

28:19.846 --> 28:21.479
what's really going on with you.

28:21.481 --> 28:23.982
Sleeping with Erin was the
symptom, not the problem.

28:27.854 --> 28:30.021
In the Original Position,

28:30.023 --> 28:33.091
no one knows where
they'll wind up in society.

28:33.093 --> 28:35.994
If you start with this foundation,

28:35.996 --> 28:38.196
that's when you get true compassion.

28:38.748 --> 28:40.096
Chunk.

28:40.533 --> 28:41.666
Excuse me.

28:41.668 --> 28:42.967
Really compelling.

28:42.969 --> 28:44.636
Where'd you learn
about Rawls's <i> Theory of Justice?</i>

28:44.638 --> 28:47.405
I read a lot, as do you.

28:47.407 --> 28:49.841
Listen, do you have somewhere
you need to be right now?

28:49.843 --> 28:51.743
Not necessarily, no.

28:51.745 --> 28:53.745
Excellent.

28:53.747 --> 28:56.091
I have a surprise for you.

29:02.956 --> 29:05.156
Flotation therapy.

29:05.158 --> 29:08.359
Helps you visualize, focus better.

29:10.463 --> 29:11.481
Chunk.

29:12.174 --> 29:13.699
I really think this can help you

29:13.701 --> 29:17.840
figure out why you've struggled
to find your path in life.

29:21.207 --> 29:22.507
Don't worry.

29:22.509 --> 29:25.105
I'll be right out here
to talk you through it.

29:27.747 --> 29:29.576
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth,

29:29.578 --> 29:31.374
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

29:31.376 --> 29:32.517
I want you to say the word “red.”

29:32.519 --> 29:34.613
State your name again for the record.

29:34.615 --> 29:36.120
Red.

29:36.122 --> 29:38.389
Yeah, but not to me.

29:38.391 --> 29:40.124
To the jury.

29:40.126 --> 29:41.459
They have to hear it at least 11 times

29:41.461 --> 29:44.529
for it to sink into their subconscious.

29:44.531 --> 29:46.064
Why 11?

29:46.066 --> 29:49.200
Repetition, enhances
the power of suggestion.

29:49.202 --> 29:51.836
By tomorrow, they'll be seeing
red without knowing why.

29:51.838 --> 29:54.138
Now, I want to work it in organically.

29:54.140 --> 29:55.707
Can't be too overt.

29:55.709 --> 29:57.408
That's why I picked red.

29:57.410 --> 29:59.343
Magenta would've been much
harder, so, thanks.

29:59.345 --> 30:00.445
Counselor?

30:00.447 --> 30:02.880
Yes. Your Honor, I am...

30:02.882 --> 30:05.216
<i>read-y</i> to go.

30:06.186 --> 30:07.985
We've all seen the video.

30:07.987 --> 30:10.722
We all saw Troy kill his father.

30:10.724 --> 30:13.424
The prosecution has argued
that it is murder.

30:13.426 --> 30:15.560
Plain and simple. Do you agree?

30:15.562 --> 30:20.031
I agree that Troy physically
caused his father's death.

30:20.033 --> 30:21.365
But I do not agree

30:21.367 --> 30:23.267
that he should be found guilty
of murder.

30:23.269 --> 30:25.002
He doesn't look crazy.

30:25.004 --> 30:26.979
So how are you coming
to that conclusion?

30:26.981 --> 30:28.706
I was asked by the state

30:28.708 --> 30:31.309
to give Troy a psychological evaluation,

30:31.311 --> 30:33.573
and it's my expert opinion

30:33.575 --> 30:36.814
that he was not in control
of his actions,

30:38.090 --> 30:40.249
which is the definition

30:40.251 --> 30:41.886
of insanity.

30:41.888 --> 30:42.954
See, that sounds

30:42.956 --> 30:44.255
hard to believe.

30:44.257 --> 30:47.391
Can someone really use hypnosis

30:47.393 --> 30:49.494
to make Troy murder?

30:49.496 --> 30:52.063
Objection. Calls for speculation.

30:52.065 --> 30:53.798
That makes me red in the face,
Your Honor.

30:53.800 --> 30:55.967
This is not speculation

30:55.969 --> 30:57.568
but expert opinion.

30:57.570 --> 30:59.270
You may answer the question.

30:59.272 --> 31:01.839
Yes, it's rare.

31:01.841 --> 31:03.941
But so is Troy.

31:03.943 --> 31:08.746
I believe hypnotic technique
forced him to attack his father

31:08.748 --> 31:10.748
and he's still not completely aware.

31:10.750 --> 31:12.183
How?

31:12.860 --> 31:14.786
He was at a driving range.

31:14.788 --> 31:17.722
Post-hypnotic suggestion
can be triggered at any time.

31:17.724 --> 31:19.724
Feeling a touch on the shoulder,

31:19.726 --> 31:22.860
hearing a particular word
or phrase, music...

31:22.862 --> 31:25.396
A Red Hot Chili Peppers song, perhaps?

31:25.398 --> 31:27.331
Sure.

31:27.333 --> 31:29.801
Triggers can be a color,
a sound, an object.

31:29.803 --> 31:31.769
Maybe something he read.

31:38.444 --> 31:40.011
Trigger must've been something

31:40.013 --> 31:42.780
near where Troy killed his father.

31:42.782 --> 31:45.850
Well, brought back everyone
who was here that day.

31:45.852 --> 31:48.052
Asked them to recreate what
they were doing at the time.

31:48.938 --> 31:51.656
Including playing the same music.

31:54.594 --> 31:58.229
Closing your eyes opens your senses.

32:04.204 --> 32:05.770
Nice swing. Yeah, it's not bad.

32:07.473 --> 32:10.942
Order 17, Philly
cheesesteak, fries, medium soda.

32:10.944 --> 32:12.818
Order 17, pick up, please.

32:12.820 --> 32:14.512
Popcorn?

32:14.514 --> 32:18.349
No, he would have walked
by that earlier.

32:18.351 --> 32:20.151
The trigger had to be something else.

32:20.691 --> 32:22.887
A color, a sound.

32:25.525 --> 32:27.391
Sorry, that didn't happen
before the murder.

32:29.329 --> 32:32.263
Troy's cell phone.

32:32.265 --> 32:34.265
We went over the call log.

32:34.267 --> 32:35.666
Not his calls.

32:35.668 --> 32:37.435
We need to look at his phone.

32:42.942 --> 32:46.878
Dr. Levin's testimony swayed
jurors three and eight.

32:46.880 --> 32:48.246
What about juror nine?

32:48.248 --> 32:49.347
Ooh, hasn't budged.

32:49.349 --> 32:50.348
She's a visual learner.

32:50.350 --> 32:51.949
Seeing is believing.

32:51.951 --> 32:55.788
And now we are gonna show her
the power of hypnosis.

32:55.790 --> 32:58.456
Cable, bring up the surveillance
footage from Chelsea Piers.

32:58.458 --> 32:59.490
Why?

32:59.492 --> 33:02.270
I know what triggered Troy to kill.

33:05.217 --> 33:07.098
What do you think?

33:07.100 --> 33:09.967
Well, I think it's freaky and I like it.

33:11.638 --> 33:13.204
It allows the mind to open,

33:13.206 --> 33:16.440
unfold its truths, confront its secrets.

33:16.442 --> 33:20.444
Now you can tell me
what's really going on.

33:20.446 --> 33:23.848
How long have you worked at TAC?

33:25.952 --> 33:29.320
Why did Dr. Bull send you here?

33:33.829 --> 33:36.217
We know you're working
for Troy's defense team.

33:36.242 --> 33:39.143
What exactly were you hoping to find?

33:39.145 --> 33:40.845
Open the door.

33:40.847 --> 33:41.846
How's Troy doing?

33:41.848 --> 33:42.914
Yes.

33:42.916 --> 33:45.483
I lied about why I came to Lumansic.

33:45.485 --> 33:48.520
But everything that I told you
about myself, my life,

33:48.522 --> 33:49.954
that was all true.

33:57.835 --> 34:00.665
Don't you ever come back here.

34:05.572 --> 34:07.004
Rachel Grey,

34:07.006 --> 34:08.873
you and your father Thornton
Grey founded Lumansic,

34:08.875 --> 34:09.974
isn't that correct?

34:09.976 --> 34:11.074
It is.

34:11.077 --> 34:13.043
What are you hoping
to get out of Rachel?

34:13.045 --> 34:15.822
Watch and listen closely.

34:16.056 --> 34:18.649
And what about your vision for Lumansic?

34:18.650 --> 34:22.286
Is-Isn't it true that your
father wants to keep it small

34:22.288 --> 34:23.554
but you want to expand?

34:23.556 --> 34:26.257
You know, more money,
more power, more influence.

34:26.259 --> 34:29.385
We've had many discussions
about the future.

34:29.387 --> 34:31.629
Contentious discussions.

34:31.630 --> 34:34.638
You had to convince him
to create a second campus.

34:34.639 --> 34:36.167
- No.
- I mean, isn't it true

34:36.168 --> 34:38.034
that you and your father
are running a cult?

34:38.036 --> 34:40.071
Absolutely not.

34:40.072 --> 34:42.072
You take advantage of people,

34:42.074 --> 34:43.833
people searching for answers.

34:43.835 --> 34:46.172
You psychologically manipulate them

34:46.174 --> 34:47.498
to your will.

34:47.501 --> 34:49.380
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

34:51.150 --> 34:53.551
Do you use hypnosis on your students?

34:54.621 --> 34:55.853
Sometimes.

34:55.855 --> 34:59.390
It's one tool of many that can
help students break through.

34:59.392 --> 35:01.310
Now, what would you think, Rachel,

35:01.784 --> 35:03.127
if I told you

35:03.880 --> 35:07.431
that simply by saying a specific word

35:07.433 --> 35:10.735
over and over... the...

35:10.737 --> 35:13.871
word “red,” for example, yesterday,

35:13.873 --> 35:17.408
that it would cause everyone on the jury

35:17.877 --> 35:20.711
to wear something red today.

35:35.492 --> 35:39.196
You spent... two years

35:39.198 --> 35:42.733
training at the American
School for Behavioral Sciences

35:42.735 --> 35:44.969
and Hypnotherapy.

35:44.971 --> 35:47.778
Hypnosis is an amplified version

35:47.780 --> 35:49.607
of the technique
that I just demonstrated.

35:49.609 --> 35:51.075
What you just demonstrated

35:51.077 --> 35:53.644
is purely persuasion.

35:53.646 --> 35:55.446
And hypnosis is a very powerful tool

35:55.448 --> 35:59.150
in the hands of a highly trained
individual like yourself,

35:59.152 --> 36:01.484
you could persuade someone

36:01.486 --> 36:02.954
to murder.

36:02.956 --> 36:04.155
Objection.

36:04.157 --> 36:05.790
Withdrawn.

36:08.061 --> 36:09.794
Could you take out your
cell phone, please?

36:09.796 --> 36:11.591
Objection. Relevance?

36:12.050 --> 36:13.261
Sustained.

36:13.263 --> 36:16.354
We will show the phone record
is relevant, Your Honor.

36:16.356 --> 36:21.321
Rachel, could you please
call Troy's phone?

36:21.323 --> 36:23.596
No. I'm not doing that.

36:23.598 --> 36:24.509
No?

36:24.511 --> 36:26.143
He can't make me do that, right?

36:26.145 --> 36:28.379
No, he can't.

36:29.682 --> 36:31.299
But I can.

36:31.301 --> 36:34.418
Ma'am, dial the phone.

36:45.298 --> 36:47.732
It's okay.

36:47.734 --> 36:48.734
Hey!

36:50.303 --> 36:51.802
Stop.

36:51.804 --> 36:53.838
Officers.

36:53.840 --> 36:54.959
Get off of him.

37:02.235 --> 37:03.581
What just happened?

37:07.820 --> 37:10.488
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

37:12.225 --> 37:14.892
That was all your doing, wasn't it?

37:14.894 --> 37:17.828
Helps you to think of me as
a cult leader, doesn't it?

37:17.830 --> 37:18.963
Makes it easier for you

37:18.965 --> 37:21.866
to send people into my house
to spy on me,

37:22.326 --> 37:24.244
to destroy my life's work,

37:24.246 --> 37:26.437
to condemn my daughter as a killer.

37:26.439 --> 37:30.707
Just as it helps you to think
of your victims as students?

37:30.709 --> 37:33.911
Makes it easier to steal their
lives and call it tuition?

37:34.545 --> 37:36.080
You should've left us alone.

37:36.978 --> 37:39.617
Then you'd never know the
truth about your daughter.

37:39.619 --> 37:41.852
The night she called Troy
to trigger him,

37:41.854 --> 37:44.355
she thought he was with you.

37:44.896 --> 37:46.424
How's that for enlightenment?

37:48.528 --> 37:51.362
<i>Has the jury reached a verdict?</i>

37:51.364 --> 37:53.831
On the charge of murder
in the second degree,

37:53.833 --> 37:57.768
we, the jury, find the
defendant, Troy Dickerson,

37:57.770 --> 38:00.438
not guilty by reason of insanity.

38:17.554 --> 38:19.590
Congratulations, Reed.

38:19.592 --> 38:20.725
You did it.

38:20.727 --> 38:22.326
You won your first insanity case.

38:22.328 --> 38:23.670
How's it feel?

38:23.672 --> 38:24.995
Pretty insane.

38:27.333 --> 38:29.633
Any-any word on Rachel?

38:29.635 --> 38:33.204
The police are opening
a formal investigation.

38:33.206 --> 38:36.173
It's likely she'll be charged
with murder and kidnapping.

38:36.175 --> 38:38.209
Don't tell Bull this,

38:38.211 --> 38:42.780
but I wasn't sure that the whole
“red” thing would actually work.

38:42.782 --> 38:45.082
Really?

38:45.084 --> 38:47.251
Nice socks.

38:47.253 --> 38:49.053
So, you were underwater?

38:49.055 --> 38:52.156
No, I was floating.

38:52.158 --> 38:54.759
It was actually quite peaceful.

38:54.761 --> 38:57.194
Was the peaceful
part before or after

38:57.196 --> 38:58.662
you heard the voice
of the crazy cult leader

38:58.664 --> 39:00.664
who told you you were
locked in the crazy pod?

39:02.001 --> 39:05.636
You know, this thing about
me being the chosen one,

39:05.638 --> 39:08.672
it got me to thinking,
we both were chosen.

39:08.674 --> 39:10.775
No, Lumansic rejected me outright.

39:10.777 --> 39:12.543
I'm not talking about them.

39:12.545 --> 39:15.346
I'm talking about a group of people

39:16.041 --> 39:18.849
with a fanatical commitment
to a charismatic leader,

39:18.851 --> 39:21.652
a belief that his way is the only way

39:21.654 --> 39:24.455
and a complete lack of life
outside of the organization.

39:24.457 --> 39:26.691
To the Cult of Bull.

39:31.464 --> 39:32.797
Nicely done.

39:34.467 --> 39:36.700
Troy has a long road of recovery
ahead of him.

39:36.702 --> 39:38.803
I'll be sure he gets
all the help he needs.

39:38.805 --> 39:39.970
Thanks.

39:39.972 --> 39:41.272
Thanks for your help with Benny.

39:41.274 --> 39:43.474
I'm afraid I didn't get very far.

39:43.476 --> 39:45.442
Far enough, I think.

39:46.134 --> 39:48.712
And what about you, Jason?

39:48.714 --> 39:49.780
How are you doing?

39:51.279 --> 39:53.117
I'm okay.

39:53.119 --> 39:54.652
Doctor.

39:54.654 --> 39:56.387
I have Tuesdays at 8:00 open.

39:56.389 --> 39:57.888
Your old slot.

39:59.458 --> 40:02.026
I think you just want my “Better
than Robert Redford,” don't you?

40:29.736 --> 40:32.487
I guess it's time I came clean?

40:33.855 --> 40:37.494
I'm being investigated by
the U.S. Attorney's office.

40:37.496 --> 40:40.798
Nine years ago, I put a
man named Hayden Watkins

40:40.800 --> 40:42.099
in prison for murder.

40:42.687 --> 40:45.548
DNA evidence has just
proven his innocence.

40:46.385 --> 40:48.413
- You were doing your job.
- No.

40:48.415 --> 40:51.508
The night before the trial
started, I got a call from...

40:51.510 --> 40:55.312
Long Island PD.

40:55.896 --> 40:59.083
They'd just had a similar crime,

40:59.085 --> 41:03.120
similar M.O., thought
it might be my guy.

41:04.124 --> 41:06.557
So I just... dismissed it

41:06.559 --> 41:09.693
because I was sure that
Watkins was guilty.

41:10.575 --> 41:13.697
I put an innocent man in
prison for nine years.

41:15.401 --> 41:17.401
You know what?

41:17.403 --> 41:18.769
That's on me.

41:18.771 --> 41:20.344
Benny...

41:21.566 --> 41:23.374
I was wrong.

41:24.710 --> 41:26.577
You haven't lost faith in yourself.

41:28.166 --> 41:29.647
I think you lost faith in me.

41:29.649 --> 41:31.315
No, that's not true.

41:31.317 --> 41:32.349
Yeah, it is true.

41:32.351 --> 41:33.751
You should've come to me with this.

41:34.751 --> 41:37.054
Solving problems is what I do.

41:38.207 --> 41:39.657
I'm not a client.

41:39.659 --> 41:41.158
You're more than that.

41:42.461 --> 41:44.461
You're family.

41:44.463 --> 41:46.646
And you're not alone.

41:48.134 --> 41:51.542
If they come after you, they
have to go through me first.
