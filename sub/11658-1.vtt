00:55.600 --> 00:58.700
They say the Everglades are drying up
and being built on.

00:58.767 --> 01:01.433
-No.
-Yes. Such a beautiful place.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.967
Eventually, there won't
be land anywhere.

01:04.033 --> 01:06.600
-It's really a shame.
-Oh, it is. It really is.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.934
-You know what's also a shame?
-What?

01:09.000 --> 01:13.834
When you sit down, your thighs Squoosh out
twice their size. That's a shame.

01:16.567 --> 01:18.700
I'm so excited about doing this.

01:18.767 --> 01:20.867
Mink breeding's a great idea.

01:20.934 --> 01:22.700
I didn't think you'd like it.

01:22.767 --> 01:25.166
-(Rose) Why?
-Well, I know your feelings about animals.

01:25.233 --> 01:28.633
And since we breeding mink for fur,
eventually, they'll have to be killed.

01:28.700 --> 01:30.967
And I just didn't think you'd do it.

01:31.033 --> 01:32.567
Do they have to be killed?

01:32.633 --> 01:35.767
No, Rose. Many women like
wearing coats that urinate.

01:41.133 --> 01:44.200
I understand. I... I grew up on a farm.

01:44.266 --> 01:45.133
I'm used to it.

01:45.200 --> 01:50.567
Farmers killing their animals
is part of the life cycle.

01:50.633 --> 01:53.333
Good animals serve man,
then go to heaven.

01:53.400 --> 01:54.233
Heaven?

01:54.300 --> 01:57.734
Yes. Heaven's full of
cows and chickens

01:57.800 --> 01:59.233
and horses and pigs.

01:59.300 --> 02:01.700
I hope heaven has boots.

02:02.934 --> 02:05.166
Isn't Blanche going to help?

02:05.233 --> 02:07.667
She still won't leave her room.

02:07.734 --> 02:09.533
She's never stayed that long.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.667
Except for that time
with the lifeguard.

02:13.633 --> 02:15.233
No, she must
really be depressed.

02:15.300 --> 02:17.266
The minks will cheer her up.

02:17.333 --> 02:18.867
If they come from Neiman-Marcus.

02:20.900 --> 02:22.533
Did Stan get you a mink?

02:22.600 --> 02:24.433
Stan wouldn't get her popcorn
at the movies.

02:26.033 --> 02:27.467
I always wanted mink.

02:27.533 --> 02:30.433
I thought I would look
elegant and impressive.

02:30.500 --> 02:31.934
We didn't have mink in Sicily.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.867
You wanted to impress someone,
you shot their brother.

02:36.867 --> 02:40.367
Oh, Blanche,
you must be feeling better.

02:40.433 --> 02:43.000
Better? Better?

02:48.567 --> 02:51.033
Blanche. Blanche, what's wrong?

02:51.100 --> 02:51.900
Nothing.

02:51.967 --> 02:53.033
What is it, Blanche?

02:53.100 --> 02:56.066
-Nothing.
-You've been crying, Honey.

02:56.133 --> 02:57.467
Are those tears of joy?

02:57.533 --> 02:58.900
Joy, joy.

02:58.967 --> 03:01.066
Ha, ha, ha! Joy.

03:01.633 --> 03:02.433
Is that joy?

03:02.500 --> 03:03.767
It doesn't look like joy.

03:03.834 --> 03:05.300
What's wrong?

03:05.367 --> 03:07.567
-I'm eating. I'm eating.
-Eating's good.

03:07.633 --> 03:10.400
-I'm nauseated.
-Then stop eating.

03:10.467 --> 03:12.400
How did this happen? How?

03:12.467 --> 03:14.233
-What, Blanche?
-Oh, my God!

03:14.300 --> 03:16.667
Blanche, please tell us what's wrong.

03:16.734 --> 03:18.767
We're your friends, your family.

03:18.834 --> 03:21.066
Nothing's so terrible
we wouldn't understand.

03:21.133 --> 03:22.800
You can tell us, what is it?

03:24.233 --> 03:25.433
I'm pregnant.

03:30.567 --> 03:32.033
-Rose?
-Rose!

03:32.100 --> 03:33.300
Oh, honey.

03:35.233 --> 03:36.667
Rose! Rose!

03:36.734 --> 03:37.734
-(tapping)
-Rose!

03:37.800 --> 03:39.333
Play nice, girls.

03:39.400 --> 03:40.567
Oh!

03:40.633 --> 03:41.667
Sophia!

03:42.867 --> 03:44.567
She fainted.

03:44.633 --> 03:45.867
Are you all right, honey?

03:45.934 --> 03:49.767
I don't know what happened.
I saw stars and blackness.

03:49.834 --> 03:51.867
It was like being at the Planetarium.

03:52.700 --> 03:55.033
-It was the shocking news.
-I'm sorry.

03:55.100 --> 03:58.100
That's okay. It was shocking news.

03:58.166 --> 04:01.433
I would have fainted,
only I thought I'd fall face down

04:01.500 --> 04:03.333
and chip my beautiful teeth.

04:04.533 --> 04:06.500
What shocking news?

04:06.567 --> 04:08.033
Blanche is pregnant.

04:08.900 --> 04:10.934
Holy cow.

04:12.033 --> 04:13.734
Blanche, are you sure?

04:13.800 --> 04:15.667
I did a home pregnancy test.

04:15.734 --> 04:17.200
It's right here.

04:17.266 --> 04:19.333
It looks like a perfume sample.

04:20.467 --> 04:22.467
Put it behind your ears, Rose.

04:25.700 --> 04:28.200
See, it starts out red,

04:28.266 --> 04:31.133
then if it stays red,
you're not pregnant,

04:31.200 --> 04:34.300
but if you are,
it turns light pink or gray.

04:34.367 --> 04:35.934
I had drapes that color once.

04:37.967 --> 04:39.800
I think it's called puce.

04:39.867 --> 04:42.233
Is that what puce is?
I always wonder.

04:42.300 --> 04:43.867
That's what the decorator said.

04:43.934 --> 04:45.400
Looks lavender to me.

04:45.467 --> 04:46.867
I hated those drapes.

04:46.934 --> 04:49.333
Lavender brings out my eyes.

04:49.400 --> 04:50.333
Your eyes aren't lavender.

04:50.400 --> 04:51.500
(Dorothy) Girls!

04:52.900 --> 04:54.100
Blanche, who's the father?

04:54.166 --> 04:55.433
The father?

04:57.767 --> 04:59.300
Gee, I don't know.

04:59.367 --> 05:01.433
You'd better figure it out.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.100
When was
your fertile period?

05:03.166 --> 05:05.433
Well, I'm nine weeks late.

05:05.500 --> 05:08.266
It was two weeks before that.
11 weeks ago?

05:08.333 --> 05:12.066
Nine weeks late, and you just realized
something is wrong?

05:12.133 --> 05:14.433
Yes. I kind of lost track.

05:15.333 --> 05:16.800
Get out your book.

05:16.867 --> 05:18.467
Find out what you did that week.

05:18.533 --> 05:20.500
We know what she did,
but with who?

05:25.200 --> 05:26.767
We had a pig once.

05:27.333 --> 05:28.934
The male pigs loved her.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.433
She was very beautiful,

05:30.500 --> 05:31.934
and she got pregnant.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.834
We never knew who the father was.

05:34.900 --> 05:38.667
My God, Rose,
what did you do on father's day?

05:39.367 --> 05:41.767
Here we go. Week of the 7th.

05:41.834 --> 05:42.700
(Rose) Who was it?

05:42.767 --> 05:44.533
-Blanche?
-I don't know.

05:44.600 --> 05:48.734
Blanche, who did you... see?

05:48.800 --> 05:51.166
That was a particularly active
time for me.

05:51.233 --> 05:52.867
I... I was looking stunning.

05:52.934 --> 05:55.467
I'd had my teeth bonded
and was irresistible.

05:55.533 --> 05:57.467
Who, Blanche?

05:57.533 --> 05:58.800
A few people.

06:00.767 --> 06:02.266
How many is a few?

06:03.266 --> 06:04.000
Two?

06:04.934 --> 06:06.900
-Well...
-Three?

06:07.633 --> 06:09.066
Do we hear four?

06:10.266 --> 06:13.200
Well, that was more
like a 10-day, two-week span.

06:13.266 --> 06:15.400
For me, that's a lifetime span.

06:17.266 --> 06:18.500
Not even.

06:20.266 --> 06:22.700
Do you realize I'll be 65 years old

06:22.767 --> 06:24.333
when this child graduates high school?

06:24.400 --> 06:25.734
Try 70.

06:27.233 --> 06:29.000
I'll be the oldest mother.

06:29.066 --> 06:33.033
Everybody thought I was
my children's sister.

06:33.100 --> 06:35.166
My body will never
come back from this one.

06:35.233 --> 06:37.266
It barely came back
from the last one.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
This is too depressing.
I'm going back to bed.

06:41.500 --> 06:42.967
A baby.

06:43.033 --> 06:45.233
She's going to have a baby.

06:45.300 --> 06:47.567
She can name a boy
after its father...

06:47.633 --> 06:49.133
Rick Joe Bob Don Dave.

06:52.734 --> 06:54.800
(tranquil music playing)

06:57.633 --> 07:00.667
I don't get it. We've done everything
to get them in the mood.

07:00.734 --> 07:04.100
Music, soft lighting. What else can we do?

07:04.166 --> 07:07.367
Leave them alone.
You're always looking. It's sick.

07:08.834 --> 07:11.567
I'm not always here, Sophia. I work.

07:11.633 --> 07:14.767
You call at lunchtime.
"Sophia, go take a look."

07:15.767 --> 07:17.500
They need an aphrodisiac.

07:17.567 --> 07:18.967
An African what?

07:20.333 --> 07:23.667
An aphrodisiac. It's a substance
that makes you feel sexy.

07:23.734 --> 07:25.667
-Really? Like what?
-(Dorothy) Yes.

07:25.734 --> 07:27.500
Like Spanish fly.

07:27.567 --> 07:29.200
Spanish flies?

07:29.266 --> 07:31.600
Fly, Rose. One fly.

07:31.667 --> 07:34.633
Come on, Dorothy.
I've been to Spain.

07:34.700 --> 07:36.500
It's not the cleanest country.

07:37.633 --> 07:39.867
They've got thousands of flies.

07:39.934 --> 07:42.033
It's not a fly, Rose.

07:42.100 --> 07:45.600
-Spanish fly is not a fly? What is it?
-A beetle.

07:45.667 --> 07:47.734
They call it a fly,
but it's really a beetle?

07:47.800 --> 07:48.533
Yes.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.066
How do they know it's Spanish?

07:50.133 --> 07:52.500
It wears a little sombrero.

07:54.533 --> 07:57.066
Why don't they call it
a Spanish beetle?

07:57.133 --> 07:59.500
Because they call it Spanish fly.

07:59.567 --> 08:02.333
-What do they call their flies?
-I don't care!

08:02.767 --> 08:04.367
Forget it. I don't care.

08:04.433 --> 08:07.800
The minks can sit there,
and we'll lose our money.

08:07.867 --> 08:10.967
Don't mention Spanish fly
to me ever again.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.834
You're really touchy
about these Spanish flies.

08:16.367 --> 08:18.100
Blanche, what did the doctor say?

08:18.166 --> 08:20.300
Say? Say?

08:29.266 --> 08:30.100
(Dorothy) Blanche.

08:30.166 --> 08:31.767
Blanche, what happened?

08:31.834 --> 08:32.767
Blanche!

08:33.300 --> 08:35.433
-Blanche!
-She's in there.

08:39.633 --> 08:41.200
Really, Columbo?

08:41.266 --> 08:43.266
Yes.

08:43.333 --> 08:44.800
Blanche, come on.

08:44.867 --> 08:46.000
What did the doctor say?

08:46.066 --> 08:48.033
(Blanche) The worst.
Just the worst thing ever.

08:48.100 --> 08:50.900
No, honey, it's not. It's okay.

08:50.967 --> 08:52.467
The baby will be fine.

08:52.533 --> 08:55.800
You'll have amniocentesis,
and it'll be fine.

08:55.867 --> 08:58.100
We'll help. You... you won't be alone.

08:58.166 --> 09:00.934
-The baby will have three mothers.
-It will be such fun.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.367
We... we can take turns feeding
and waking up with him.

09:04.433 --> 09:06.400
I'll do car-pools for school.

09:06.467 --> 09:09.000
I'll help with homework.
I teach.

09:09.066 --> 09:12.500
Then we'll send him
to the University of Minnesota.

09:15.567 --> 09:19.000
Minnesota. Are you crazy, Rose?

09:19.066 --> 09:20.667
This kid is going to Harvard.

09:20.734 --> 09:23.233
Dorothy, those ivy league schools

09:23.300 --> 09:26.000
are so snotty
with those preppy people.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.934
In Minnesota, he'll get a mix.

09:28.033 --> 09:30.834
Of cattle.
He goes to Harvard.

09:30.900 --> 09:33.066
You can't decide.
We'll vote.

09:33.133 --> 09:36.533
Nobody will vote for Minnesota
over Harvard, Rose.

09:36.600 --> 09:37.567
Oh, really?

09:37.633 --> 09:39.467
He's not going anywhere.

09:39.533 --> 09:40.500
It's a girl?

09:40.567 --> 09:43.000
No girl, no boy.
I'm not pregnant.

09:43.066 --> 09:46.066
It's worse. It's much worse.

09:46.133 --> 09:47.500
Blanche, what is it?

09:48.934 --> 09:50.567
My life is over.

09:50.633 --> 09:54.033
Oh, Blanche, I'm sorry.

09:54.567 --> 09:57.900
I'm sorry for thinking
those bad things

09:57.967 --> 09:59.533
when I thought
you were pregnant.

09:59.600 --> 10:03.400
Like what a slut you were
having all those men...

10:03.467 --> 10:05.900
Things only a tramp would do,

10:05.967 --> 10:10.734
but now that you're dying,
please forgive me, Blanche.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.300
I'm not dying,
but I might as well be.

10:14.033 --> 10:16.800
It's menopause.
I wish I could die.

10:16.867 --> 10:19.066
It's the end of my life.

10:21.333 --> 10:24.233
(melancholy music playing)

10:27.567 --> 10:30.867
(tranquil music playing)

10:32.200 --> 10:33.667
Why do I have to see
a psychiatrist?

10:33.734 --> 10:36.367
Because you've
stayed in bed all week.

10:36.433 --> 10:38.934
You don't eat, sleep.
All you do is cry.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.200
Either you see
the psychiatrist or we do.

10:42.800 --> 10:45.066
Why do you all have to be here?

10:45.133 --> 10:47.767
I'm here for the lunch
at Wolfie's after.

10:53.734 --> 10:54.934
Did you see him?

10:55.000 --> 10:56.333
Total fruitcake.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.066
We're talking serial murderer.

10:59.100 --> 11:01.000
If somebody tries to murder cereal,

11:01.066 --> 11:02.900
he should see a psychiatrist.

11:07.867 --> 11:10.834
Don't talk for the rest
of the afternoon.

11:13.233 --> 11:15.633
Ma, perfectly normal people
see psychiatrists.

11:15.700 --> 11:19.000
It's like talking to an old,
knowledgeable, good friend.

11:19.066 --> 11:22.433
If that was the case,
they wouldn't call them psychiatrists.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.066
They'd call them friends.

11:24.133 --> 11:26.367
Psychiatrist means psych...

11:26.433 --> 11:28.000
for psycho.

11:29.166 --> 11:30.633
It does not.

11:30.700 --> 11:31.567
She's right.

11:32.166 --> 11:34.667
He'll think I'm crazy.

11:34.734 --> 11:37.133
Why else would I be here?
I'm leaving.

11:37.200 --> 11:38.834
Take your hands off me!

11:38.900 --> 11:40.266
You cannot make me!

11:40.333 --> 11:44.133
I'm not revealing secrets
to someone who thinks I'm crazy.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.300
I can't! I won't!

11:46.367 --> 11:48.033
Pull yourself together, for God's sake.

11:48.100 --> 11:49.900
You're in a psychiatrist's office.

11:53.533 --> 11:55.400
-Blanche Devereaux.
-Oh, my God.

11:55.467 --> 11:58.000
-Go on. We'll be right here.
-(sighs)

12:04.734 --> 12:07.700
See him? Banana boat time.
He's talking to himself.

12:09.467 --> 12:11.033
He is not.

12:11.100 --> 12:13.900
He's wearing dentures,
and they just keep slipping.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.367
Sure. Right.

12:24.934 --> 12:26.934
Sir, are you talking
to yourself?

12:27.000 --> 12:28.100
Of course not.

12:28.633 --> 12:30.166
Fram Wonk's talking to me.

12:30.233 --> 12:31.600
He's my Martian friend

12:31.667 --> 12:34.066
who landed his spacecraft in my yard.

12:37.100 --> 12:38.533
See you at Wolfie's.

12:54.033 --> 12:56.533
But why is your life over?

12:56.600 --> 12:57.967
Because it is.

12:58.033 --> 12:59.900
Because it means I'm old.

12:59.967 --> 13:02.066
I'm not a real woman anymore.

13:02.133 --> 13:03.567
All it really means

13:03.633 --> 13:06.033
is you're not able to bear children.

13:06.100 --> 13:07.867
It means much more than that.

13:08.567 --> 13:11.033
I don't know how it happened.

13:11.100 --> 13:13.633
Only yesterday,
I was magnolia queen.

13:16.500 --> 13:19.700
I remember my Aunt Lynette
going crazy about that time

13:19.767 --> 13:22.066
and my mother whispering to me,

13:22.133 --> 13:24.734
"Oh, she's going through the change."

13:24.800 --> 13:26.467
I thought, "Poor Aunt Lynette,

13:26.533 --> 13:28.767
going through this change thing."

13:28.834 --> 13:33.467
I didn't know what it was, but I knew
it wasn't going to happen to me.

13:34.066 --> 13:36.600
Now here I am. I'm Aunt Lynette.

13:36.667 --> 13:39.700
No, you're not. You're Blanche.

13:39.767 --> 13:42.133
And all that's happening
is a biological process

13:42.200 --> 13:45.166
which means one thing only...

13:45.233 --> 13:47.033
you can no longer have children.

13:47.100 --> 13:50.533
It means more than that,
much more.

13:50.600 --> 13:53.300
I can't even believe
I'm really here.

13:53.367 --> 13:56.934
I mean, at this point in my life,

13:57.000 --> 13:59.200
I can't believe we're having this
conversation about me.

13:59.266 --> 14:00.800
It's hard to accept.

14:00.867 --> 14:04.066
Nobody in my family's
ever seen a psychiatrist,

14:04.133 --> 14:06.834
except, of course,
when they were institutionalized.

14:09.900 --> 14:11.967
It's just so awful!

14:12.033 --> 14:14.066
But you're a man.
You wouldn't understand.

14:14.133 --> 14:16.100
Why wouldn't I understand?

14:16.166 --> 14:20.300
Well, you don't get old and lose
your appeal like women.

14:20.367 --> 14:24.567
Cary Grant could have any woman.
He's in his 80s.

14:24.633 --> 14:28.000
No woman over 50 can do that
except Joan Collins.

14:28.066 --> 14:30.133
She belongs in a wax museum.

14:31.400 --> 14:34.033
Okay. It's not just menopause.

14:34.100 --> 14:36.600
It's what it represents to you...
growing older.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.600
-Yes.
-Growing older represents

14:38.667 --> 14:40.734
-loss of attractiveness.
-Yes.

14:40.800 --> 14:43.333
That's all you are... sex appeal?

14:43.400 --> 14:45.066
Yes.

14:46.333 --> 14:48.033
Men only value that in you?

14:48.100 --> 14:49.800
Well, they used to.

14:49.867 --> 14:52.200
Now I'll have to
become an intellectual

14:52.266 --> 14:54.033
and find a retired Jew.

14:57.767 --> 14:58.934
Blanche...

15:00.533 --> 15:03.133
you have to change your thinking,

15:03.200 --> 15:06.233
find all the other things you are,

15:06.300 --> 15:08.166
all the other ways
you please people.

15:09.166 --> 15:10.967
There's more to you
than you know.

15:11.033 --> 15:13.166
Sometimes in the mirror,

15:13.233 --> 15:15.633
I see my mother's face
looking back at me.

15:15.700 --> 15:18.600
Not always,
just every now and then,

15:18.667 --> 15:21.600
when the light's bright
or it's early morning

15:21.667 --> 15:24.533
or late at night or I look fast.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.533
There it is... my mother's face.

15:28.133 --> 15:29.367
Scares me to death.

15:29.433 --> 15:31.867
It just scares me to death.

15:31.934 --> 15:33.367
I get so depressed,

15:33.433 --> 15:36.700
I don't want to get out of bed
in the morning.

15:36.767 --> 15:39.367
I don't want to get out of bed...

15:39.433 --> 15:40.667
ever again.

15:46.633 --> 15:49.266
(melancholy music playing)

15:55.867 --> 15:58.834
Dr. Parks better get those minks
in the mood.

15:58.900 --> 16:01.967
He's a wonderful vet.
He'll solve the problem.

16:02.033 --> 16:04.600
You're out of bed.
This is wonderful.

16:04.667 --> 16:06.100
No, it's not wonderful.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.800
I was in bed eating.

16:07.867 --> 16:11.000
If I don't walk around,
I'll become a hippo.

16:11.066 --> 16:15.400
Life, if I can call it that,
has to go on.

16:16.233 --> 16:19.133
I'll just spend my remaining years
in the company of women.

16:20.200 --> 16:24.233
I'm only sticking around
to read Danielle Steele's next book.

16:24.300 --> 16:26.400
This is all from the change?

16:26.467 --> 16:27.967
I hate that expression.

16:28.033 --> 16:31.333
What's the big deal? It's nothing.

16:31.400 --> 16:32.600
Look at it this way...

16:32.667 --> 16:34.734
No cramps once a month,

16:34.800 --> 16:36.934
no eating binges once a month,

16:37.000 --> 16:38.834
no craziness once a month.

16:38.900 --> 16:40.367
You just grow a beard.

16:48.400 --> 16:49.900
Don't listen to her.

16:49.967 --> 16:52.600
You grow a beard, Dorothy, believe me.
I woke up one morning,

16:52.667 --> 16:53.600
I looked like Arafat.

16:53.667 --> 16:55.400
Oh, my God!

16:57.367 --> 16:58.900
I never grew one.

16:58.967 --> 17:00.900
You never grew brains, either.

17:02.567 --> 17:05.266
I tell you, menopause
was wonderful for me.

17:05.333 --> 17:07.467
-(sighs)
-No more PMS.

17:07.533 --> 17:09.000
I never had PMS.

17:09.066 --> 17:10.233
Neither did I.

17:10.300 --> 17:12.100
But I had a BMW.

17:15.700 --> 17:17.266
A red one. Charlie bought it--

17:17.333 --> 17:19.100
PMS!

17:19.166 --> 17:22.000
Premenstrual syndrome, Rose.

17:22.066 --> 17:24.000
You mean you never
got crazy once a month?

17:24.066 --> 17:25.033
No.

17:25.100 --> 17:25.967
Boy, I did.

17:26.033 --> 17:28.567
I'd cry, scream, carry on,

17:28.633 --> 17:30.567
gain 10 pounds of water.

17:30.633 --> 17:33.467
Well, menopause ended that.
I loved it.

17:33.533 --> 17:35.266
How could you love it?

17:35.333 --> 17:36.600
I didn't see it

17:36.667 --> 17:39.667
as having anything to do
with my sexuality.

17:39.734 --> 17:41.967
I'm exactly who I was.

17:42.033 --> 17:43.066
Unfortunately.

17:43.133 --> 17:44.200
Thank you.

17:44.266 --> 17:45.700
Men are so lucky.

17:45.767 --> 17:48.734
No periods, so they
never stop getting them.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.734
They don't go through this.

17:50.800 --> 17:54.233
They call us crazy
with them or without them.

17:54.300 --> 17:56.266
I remember my first period.

17:56.333 --> 17:58.300
Nobody told me anything.

17:58.367 --> 17:59.633
Boy, was I surprised.

17:59.700 --> 18:00.934
Your mother didn't tell you?

18:01.000 --> 18:03.200
Mother was very prim and proper.

18:03.266 --> 18:05.300
Oh, what a surprise.

18:07.433 --> 18:10.667
My whole childhood,
I heard about "the curse".

18:10.734 --> 18:13.667
When I was 13,
I'd get "the curse".

18:13.734 --> 18:15.667
Oh, I was absolutely terrified.

18:15.734 --> 18:17.200
My entire 13th year,

18:17.266 --> 18:19.600
I slept with the lights on.

18:20.133 --> 18:23.166
I knew there was a witch
behind every wisteria.

18:23.233 --> 18:26.100
I stayed home Halloween.
I was a wreck.

18:26.166 --> 18:29.333
But the year went by and no curse.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.867
Another year went by.
No curse.

18:31.934 --> 18:36.467
Mama took me to the doctor.
I didn't have the curse.

18:36.533 --> 18:39.767
He said, "Blanche, you still
don't have your period?"

18:39.834 --> 18:44.467
I said, "Of course I have my period.
I've had it two years.

18:44.533 --> 18:46.467
It's the curse I don't have!"

18:52.367 --> 18:54.066
I got it, nobody told me.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.100
I didn't get it, nobody told me.

18:56.166 --> 18:59.200
I figured that's life
and returned to my meatballs.

19:01.967 --> 19:03.700
When I stopped, it just happened.

19:03.767 --> 19:05.300
A few hot flashes.

19:05.367 --> 19:07.200
I've heard about hot flashes.

19:07.266 --> 19:08.934
They didn't bother me.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.900
In Florida, who can tell hot flashes
from weather fronts?

19:14.500 --> 19:16.600
Oh, it's all so depressing!

19:16.667 --> 19:19.900
My cousin didn't
get her period for 20 years.

19:19.967 --> 19:21.834
At 72, she got pregnant.

19:24.233 --> 19:25.667
Ma, that never happened.

19:25.734 --> 19:27.100
It did.

19:27.166 --> 19:30.100
Then it must be in the
<i>Guinness Book of Records.</i>

19:30.166 --> 19:32.233
It is. The Sicilian one.

19:32.300 --> 19:34.433
<i>Garibaldi Book of Records.</i>

19:34.500 --> 19:37.967
No 72-year-old woman
ever became pregnant.

19:38.033 --> 19:39.767
So? It cheered her up.

19:42.033 --> 19:45.967
She'll cheer up when she realizes
it makes no difference.

19:46.033 --> 19:48.767
It's just a concept, not reality.

19:48.834 --> 19:49.967
That will cheer her up.

19:50.033 --> 19:52.867
Nothing will.
It has rained on my parade.

19:52.934 --> 19:53.800
(Dr. Parks) Hello.

19:53.867 --> 19:55.400
Dr. Parks. Come right in.

19:55.467 --> 19:57.633
-Who's that?
-The vet.

19:57.700 --> 19:59.133
You haven't met Blanche.

19:59.200 --> 20:00.567
No, he has not.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.700
I'd remember if he had.

20:02.767 --> 20:04.500
Thank you for coming.

20:04.567 --> 20:08.200
A man as brilliant as you
must be terribly busy.

20:08.266 --> 20:10.734
The change of life
didn't change her life.

20:11.800 --> 20:14.500
Well, the minks won't breed

20:14.567 --> 20:15.767
because they're too old.

20:15.834 --> 20:16.734
You're kidding.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.633
Isn't he brilliant?

20:18.700 --> 20:21.633
Somebody sold you minks
too old to breed.

20:21.700 --> 20:24.100
They're worn out,
not interested anymore.

20:24.166 --> 20:25.266
You can be too old?

20:25.333 --> 20:27.900
Rodents can be, not humans.

20:27.967 --> 20:29.567
Is that a theory

20:29.633 --> 20:33.800
or is that based on...
personal experience?

20:34.700 --> 20:35.900
Both.

20:35.967 --> 20:39.100
There's a lizard out on the lanai

20:39.166 --> 20:40.300
that's looking awful peaked.

20:40.367 --> 20:42.400
Would you mind taking a look?

20:42.467 --> 20:44.066
Not at all.

20:44.133 --> 20:48.333
I'm so worried about
the poor thing, I can't sleep.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.400
I'm such a lover of animals.

20:52.867 --> 20:56.100
She could be in a coma,
put a man within 5 miles,

20:56.166 --> 20:58.734
she'd roll over
and shave her legs.

21:06.200 --> 21:09.867
I can't believe they sold us
old minks.

21:09.934 --> 21:11.934
-Who can you trust?
-No one.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.066
I learned that in Sicily.
Works in Miami.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.900
We wound up spending $678
in the mink business.

21:20.967 --> 21:22.700
-What did we make?
-Make?

21:22.767 --> 21:26.734
A mistake, Rose.
A very large, expensive mistake.

21:26.800 --> 21:28.300
Hello there.

21:28.367 --> 21:30.834
How did it go?
Is your lizard still alive?

21:30.900 --> 21:33.000
He just loved me,
but then he would.

21:33.066 --> 21:35.200
I'm sophisticated,
worldly, glamorous.

21:35.266 --> 21:40.033
But maybe he's too nice and decent
for me, know what I mean?

21:40.100 --> 21:41.133
-Yes.
-Yes.

21:43.533 --> 21:44.900
Well, I had a good time.

21:44.967 --> 21:46.567
He's very nice.

21:46.633 --> 21:50.233
I think I'm over
my menopausal depression.

21:50.300 --> 21:52.433
Honey, you just needed
the confidence

21:52.500 --> 21:54.333
to know you're still attractive.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.033
Dr. Parks helped do that.

21:56.100 --> 21:57.533
Maybe a little,

21:57.600 --> 22:01.533
but I know beauty like mine
cannot fade overnight.

22:01.600 --> 22:04.900
He didn't really help that much.
It was you girls.

22:05.633 --> 22:09.033
You let me be crazy.
You were there through it all.

22:09.100 --> 22:11.200
We live here.

22:12.500 --> 22:15.633
But you were caring and supportive.
I thank you for it.

22:15.700 --> 22:18.400
I'm lucky to have friends like you.

22:18.467 --> 22:20.166
Oh, the little rats are still here.

22:20.233 --> 22:22.567
The animal people
are coming tomorrow.

22:22.633 --> 22:23.867
-No, they aren’t.
-I called.

22:23.934 --> 22:24.934
I canceled.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.700
-What do you mean?
-We are not giving away Fluffy,

22:27.767 --> 22:29.800
Muffy, Buffy, and Joanne.

22:30.734 --> 22:33.100
Rose, they are non-breeding minks

22:33.166 --> 22:35.166
who eat their weight in food every day.

22:35.233 --> 22:36.233
Joanne?

22:36.300 --> 22:39.300
We're not giving them away.
This is their home.

22:39.367 --> 22:41.133
Eat their weight in food?

22:41.200 --> 22:43.367
When I'm depressed, so do I.

22:43.433 --> 22:44.633
No, they go.

22:44.700 --> 22:46.266
The minks stay.

22:46.333 --> 22:48.266
They serve man,
now we serve them.

22:48.333 --> 22:49.533
Come on!

22:49.600 --> 22:52.200
Just because they're
too old to breed,

22:52.266 --> 22:54.967
they're useless, no good for anything?

22:55.033 --> 22:56.367
The minks stay.

22:56.433 --> 22:57.900
Right.

22:57.967 --> 23:00.500
Let's cook them something to eat.

23:00.567 --> 23:01.600
Yeah.

23:01.667 --> 23:04.400
-Oh, my God!
-What?

23:04.467 --> 23:07.767
-I think they're making...
-What?

23:07.834 --> 23:10.367
They're making a stole!

23:10.433 --> 23:11.967
Let me see. Let me see.

23:14.700 --> 23:16.600
Yep, they are.
We're back in business.

23:16.667 --> 23:17.567
Oh, please.

23:17.633 --> 23:20.300
They are. They really are,
and I don't know a thing about animals.

23:22.533 --> 23:25.934
Well, they certainly are...

23:26.000 --> 23:28.300
but don't count your money yet.

23:28.367 --> 23:30.500
Those are the two males.

23:38.800 --> 23:41.467
