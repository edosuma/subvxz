WEBVTT

00:02.086 --> 00:03.417
Previously on "Teen Wolf..."

00:03.629 --> 00:05.961
Everyone around me gets hurt.

00:06.174 --> 00:08.586
Mountain Ash is some of what
you'll use to create the barrier.

00:08.801 --> 00:10.757
The only way
to protect one person

00:10.970 --> 00:12.380
is to kill another.

00:12.597 --> 00:15.555
A certain level of electric current
will keep you from transforming.

00:15.766 --> 00:17.302
Derek killed one of ours.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.474
Either he joins our pack,
or Kali goes after him

00:19.687 --> 00:21.018
and we kill him.

00:25.109 --> 00:27.441
Okay, keep pressure on it.
The doctor is on her way.

00:27.653 --> 00:30.360
Does anyone know where Dr. Hilyard is?

00:31.491 --> 00:32.856
There you go.

00:35.828 --> 00:37.204
Oh, thank God.

00:39.373 --> 00:40.909
I'm starving.

00:42.168 --> 00:43.123
Oh.

00:43.336 --> 00:46.294
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Thank you for bringing me dinner.

00:47.673 --> 00:50.380
- Is everything okay?
- Except for half the accident victims

00:50.593 --> 00:53.084
in a 10-car pile-up being
rerouted here from downtown,

00:53.304 --> 00:55.260
and the ER attending
not answering any of his pages?

00:55.473 --> 00:57.805
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- What does "not answering pages" mean?

00:58.017 --> 00:59.097
It means that nobody can find him.

00:59.310 --> 01:01.141
So now we have to wait
for the on-call to get here.

01:01.312 --> 01:02.267
- Miss?
- Yes?

01:02.480 --> 01:04.766
Excuse me. Can I please
have something for the pain?

01:04.982 --> 01:06.097
Okay, I'm sorry. I know.

01:06.317 --> 01:08.933
But actually giving you something
could complicate things, so...

01:09.111 --> 01:12.649
We really just need to wait
for the doctors, okay?

01:12.865 --> 01:15.242
- Okay, how much longer on Dr. Hilyard?
- Ten minutes.

01:18.579 --> 01:19.568
Uh...

01:20.081 --> 01:21.912
You know,
I think | read online

01:22.124 --> 01:26.208
that sometimes human contact
can help with pain.

01:48.693 --> 01:50.934
Someone... Someone help me!

01:52.947 --> 01:54.437
I need help!

01:56.826 --> 01:58.066
It's Dr. Hilyard again.

01:58.286 --> 02:00.698
Can you let Melissa know
that it may be more than 10 minutes?

02:00.913 --> 02:02.574
I think there's an accident up ahead.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.122
Yeah, a lO-car pile-up,
which is why we need you here.

02:05.334 --> 02:07.074
I'm going as fast as I can.

02:07.503 --> 02:08.583
Okay.

02:08.838 --> 02:10.544
Okay, gentle, gentle, gentle!

02:11.757 --> 02:13.133
- What did you do to him?
- Nothing.

02:13.342 --> 02:15.298
He said he was having chest pains
and trouble breathing,

02:15.511 --> 02:16.717
but it just kept getting worse.

02:16.929 --> 02:19.966
This is not good.
How much longer on Dr. Hilyard?

02:20.182 --> 02:23.094
His larynx has shifted to the side.
I think it's a tension pneumothorax.

02:29.900 --> 02:30.889
Mistletoe.

02:53.007 --> 02:55.794
Can you two please go back
to the waiting room?

02:56.010 --> 02:58.126
Where are the nurses and the doctors?
Where is everyone?

02:58.346 --> 03:00.507
It's a full house tonight.
They're tending to other patients.

03:00.723 --> 03:02.054
Okay. Well, Mom, how can we help?

03:02.266 --> 03:04.302
Honey, you can't.
His lung is collapsed.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.975
His heart is being pushed
against his chest cavity now.

03:07.146 --> 03:08.556
He's gonna die, isn't he?

03:11.317 --> 03:13.228
No. No, he's not.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.812
Scott, you grab the tape.

03:15.029 --> 03:16.690
You grab those scissors
and cut his shirt open.

03:22.536 --> 03:23.525
Okay.

03:24.288 --> 03:25.494
Mom, he's not breathing.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.287
I know, I know.

03:28.751 --> 03:29.866
Okay.

03:38.135 --> 03:40.091
How did you get in?

04:09.333 --> 04:11.449
Okay, here we go.

04:22.263 --> 04:23.423
Thank you.

04:25.015 --> 04:26.300
No problem.

04:28.769 --> 04:29.929
What?

04:30.271 --> 04:31.681
That was awesome.

04:33.816 --> 04:35.681
It wasn't a...
No problem, you know.

04:35.901 --> 04:38.062
I mean, it wasn't a big deal.

04:50.916 --> 04:53.623
I know you're not gonna believe me,
but I didn't do anything.

04:54.253 --> 04:56.289
All I know is that the minute
that you got here,

04:56.505 --> 04:58.370
you went right for Danny.
And your brother went for Lydia.

04:58.591 --> 05:00.547
- We're not gonna hurt him.
- Why should I believe you?

05:01.135 --> 05:04.002
Because we knew one of them was
gonna be important to you,

05:04.221 --> 05:05.552
and now we know it's Lydia.

05:31.540 --> 05:32.950
What is it?

06:20.673 --> 06:22.163
Two missing...

06:22.466 --> 06:25.754
Hang on there.
They were both in the car?

06:25.970 --> 06:29.007
No, Dad. They're trying to tell you
that it was two separate kidnappings, okay?

06:29.223 --> 06:31.509
- Two doctors, both gone.
- So whose car is this?

06:31.725 --> 06:34.137
Dr. Hilyard.
The on-call doctor.

06:34.353 --> 06:36.844
The ER attending is
the one that never made it in.

06:37.147 --> 06:39.138
Let me just focus on getting
your story first, all right?

06:39.358 --> 06:41.144
- Yeah.
- Boys, give us a second.

06:47.241 --> 06:49.152
These are definitely sacrifices, right?

06:49.368 --> 06:51.609
Yeah, it's one Deaton mentioned. Healers.

06:51.829 --> 06:53.660
What about Danny?
He threw up mistletoe.

06:53.873 --> 06:54.908
That's not a coincidence.

06:55.124 --> 06:56.955
And if he hadn't been with Ethan,
he probably would've died.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.498
And Danny's not a healer?

07:04.049 --> 07:05.880
Can you hear that?

07:09.889 --> 07:11.425
They found a body.

07:42.004 --> 07:43.210
What does it mean?

07:58.145 --> 07:59.681
It means they're coming.

08:01.315 --> 08:02.395
Tonight.

08:18.374 --> 08:19.580
Really, boys?

08:21.710 --> 08:22.790
Boys!

08:25.422 --> 08:28.585
- What do you think you're doing?
- Uh... We were watching over you.

08:29.593 --> 08:32.380
We wanted to make sure
you weren't the third sacrifice.

08:32.554 --> 08:34.010
But both of you were asleep.

08:36.475 --> 08:37.931
You were on watch last.

08:38.102 --> 08:39.717
What are you talking about?
You were on watch last.

08:39.937 --> 08:41.848
No, you were on watch last.

08:42.898 --> 08:44.763
l might've been on watch last.

08:46.318 --> 08:47.558
My heroes.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.734
Wait, didn't you say
that they were all doctors?

08:49.947 --> 08:52.233
I mean, I haven't had an MD.
recently attached to the end of my name,

08:52.408 --> 08:53.818
so I think I'm in the clear.

08:53.993 --> 08:57.451
Yeah, but it could just come
under any kind of healer, Mom.

08:57.663 --> 08:59.949
And you were definitely
a healer last night.

09:00.499 --> 09:03.115
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna be
anyone's human sacrifice today.

09:03.335 --> 09:06.077
So, both of you, get your butts to school.

09:09.174 --> 09:10.459
Good morning.

09:10.676 --> 09:13.008
As you all know,
Mr. Harris is still missing.

09:13.387 --> 09:14.877
I mean, sick.

09:15.180 --> 09:18.547
Anyway, I'm filling in
while we all hope and pray

09:18.767 --> 09:22.100
for a more qualified substitute
to take my place.

09:22.354 --> 09:24.845
Okay. So let's get started, shall we?

09:25.107 --> 09:28.599
Hey, my dad said
that the ER attending wasn't strangled,

09:28.819 --> 09:31.481
but did die from asphyxiation.
They just don't know how.

09:31.989 --> 09:34.150
Do you think the on-call doctor
could still be alive?

09:34.408 --> 09:35.818
I don't know.

09:35.993 --> 09:38.609
But, Scott, there's got to be at least
20 other doctors in that hospital.

09:38.829 --> 09:40.160
At least. You know?

09:40.372 --> 09:42.237
Any one of them could be next.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.330
Hey, Doc. Sorry, I'm in class right now.
Can I call you back later?

09:47.546 --> 09:48.956
Unfortunately, no.

09:49.214 --> 09:52.752
I honestly thought I might never
have to burden you like this,

09:52.968 --> 09:55.505
but I'm afraid, at the moment,

09:55.721 --> 09:57.427
you're my only hope.

10:00.642 --> 10:02.507
I'm going to be taken.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.764
I need you to find me.

10:06.315 --> 10:08.681
Doc, Doc, Doc, Doc, what's happening?

10:33.759 --> 10:35.465
Go back to school.

10:35.636 --> 10:37.718
Well, actually, we can't.

10:37.930 --> 10:41.297
Boyd and l are incredibly
and unbelievably sick.

10:41.517 --> 10:43.178
With what, brain damage?

10:43.393 --> 10:44.849
Well, l have a migraine

10:46.021 --> 10:48.854
and Boyd here has explosive diarrhea.

10:49.775 --> 10:51.140
We're here to protect you.

10:51.568 --> 10:53.433
You're here to protect me?

10:53.904 --> 10:56.361
Well, I'm in trouble then.

10:56.573 --> 10:58.950
Well, actually, Boyd here
came up with a plan.

10:59.701 --> 11:02.784
Yeah, I thought about the time
Gerard had me and Erica locked up,

11:03.205 --> 11:06.663
tied up with electrical wires
pushing current through us.

11:06.875 --> 11:09.537
l was wondering how we could
do something like that.

11:13.674 --> 11:15.084
But on a bigger scale.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.263
How did you know?

11:20.514 --> 11:22.630
Stiles called me
as soon as you left school.

11:22.933 --> 11:26.141
I'm sorry.
Your boss' car is still here

11:26.353 --> 11:28.309
and the back door was wide open.

11:29.148 --> 11:30.263
Scott.

11:32.401 --> 11:34.266
I need you to tell me everything.

11:39.449 --> 11:40.609
In a pool of electrified water,

11:40.784 --> 11:42.945
it can take up to 50 milliamps
to kill a normal human,

11:43.162 --> 11:44.868
less than the power it takes
to turn on a light bulb.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.286
That's comforting.

11:46.832 --> 11:50.040
If we disable the circuit interrupter
in the building's electrical room,

11:50.252 --> 11:53.585
the current will keep coming,
and anyone who steps foot in here,

11:53.755 --> 11:55.586
they'll get a pretty shocking surprise.

11:55.799 --> 11:57.790
Especially someone who's barefoot.

12:01.847 --> 12:05.089
All right,
we're gonna do everything we can.

12:05.309 --> 12:07.721
Right now, the best thing you can do
is go back to school.

12:25.913 --> 12:26.993
We have to tell him.

12:28.916 --> 12:30.656
You mean, like, "tell him" tell him?

12:30.876 --> 12:32.787
Or tell him something else
that isn't telling him

12:33.003 --> 12:35.244
- what I think you want to tell him?
- You know what I mean.

12:35.464 --> 12:36.829
You remember how your mom reacted?

12:37.049 --> 12:39.040
She didn't look you in
the eye for, like, a week.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.760
And she got over it.

12:41.887 --> 12:43.923
And it actually made us closer.

12:44.890 --> 12:46.221
I don't know, dude.
I mean, look at him.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.219
Come on, he's completely
overwhelmed as it is.

12:48.435 --> 12:52.144
He's overwhelmed because he has
no clue what's happening.

12:52.356 --> 12:55.268
He's got people dying in his town,
the town that he's supposed to protect.

12:55.484 --> 12:58.271
And it's not his fault that he doesn't
know what's happening.

12:58.487 --> 13:03.106
- He's gonna find out sooner or later.
- Okay, but is now really the right time?

13:03.325 --> 13:05.361
What if not telling him now
gets someone else killed?

13:05.577 --> 13:08.489
What if telling him gets him killed, huh?

13:08.705 --> 13:11.412
I mean, okay, look, I get that Deaton's
been like a father to you.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.741
| get that, okay?
But this isn't...

13:13.961 --> 13:15.792
Scott, this is my actual father.

13:16.380 --> 13:17.620
I can't...

13:19.716 --> 13:21.877
I can't lose both of my parents, all right?

13:22.469 --> 13:23.970
Not both of them.

13:25.722 --> 13:26.837
You're right.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.475
No, I'm not.

13:33.772 --> 13:35.273
I'm not right.

13:38.360 --> 13:39.770
I'll tell him.

13:40.612 --> 13:42.148
I'll help you.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.489
Please.
Whatever you need,

13:54.084 --> 13:55.949
however you can help find my brother.

13:56.837 --> 13:58.828
Will you excuse us for a minute?
Thank you.

14:02.801 --> 14:04.587
Listen closely, both of you.

14:04.803 --> 14:08.341
No sheriff, deputy or detective
is going to be able to find him.

14:08.932 --> 14:10.718
You don't have to ask us for help.

14:10.892 --> 14:13.304
Actually, I'm trying to help you.

14:13.562 --> 14:17.180
Because if you're going to find my brother,
then you need to use the one person

14:17.399 --> 14:20.766
who might actually have an ability
to seek out the supernatural.

14:23.864 --> 14:25.104
Lydia.

14:40.881 --> 14:42.212
Oh, man.

14:46.887 --> 14:48.218
Where are you going?

14:49.014 --> 14:51.255
Dude, it's a fire alarm.

14:52.142 --> 14:55.305
When in high school has a fire alarm
actually been a real fire?

14:55.604 --> 14:59.643
That's exactly the kind of thing
you'd expect two dumbass students to say

14:59.858 --> 15:02.315
just before getting burned alive.

15:02.527 --> 15:03.642
You first.

15:04.613 --> 15:05.728
Go.

15:19.002 --> 15:21.414
You don't have very good
taste in guys, do you?

15:22.881 --> 15:24.041
Hey.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.918
It's Dr. Hilyard, isn't it?

15:26.802 --> 15:29.669
- Yeah.
- Oh, God. Okay.

15:30.222 --> 15:32.838
Did she have ligature marks
around her throat?

15:33.725 --> 15:35.306
No. How do you know about that?

15:35.560 --> 15:37.676
I need you to take a look
at the other body with me.

15:37.896 --> 15:39.136
I think I know how they both died.

15:39.356 --> 15:41.688
And I think it's gonna
help you find Scott's boss.

15:45.529 --> 15:46.609
Is there a problem?

15:46.947 --> 15:50.656
Yeah, Derek would like to kindly
ask you to stop seeing Aiden.

15:51.243 --> 15:53.234
Which means that
if I catch you with him again,

15:53.453 --> 15:55.114
I'm not going to pull the fire alarm.

15:55.330 --> 15:57.867
I'm going to pull your
tongue out of your head.

15:58.041 --> 16:02.159
Sweetheart, my last boyfriend
was a homicidal lizard.

16:02.421 --> 16:05.504
So, I think I can handle a werewolf.

16:08.093 --> 16:09.333
Let go.

16:10.137 --> 16:11.673
- I said...
- Let go.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.216
I said, "Let go."

16:41.543 --> 16:44.205
- A Ouija board?
- Also called a spirit board.

16:44.421 --> 16:46.753
- And it's worth a shot.
- A shot in the dark.

16:46.965 --> 16:50.128
Would you just try it, please, okay?
Let's not forget who this is for.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.959
Scott's boss, the guy who has
saved our collective asses

16:53.180 --> 16:54.545
on more than one occasion.

16:54.764 --> 16:57.756
- Okay, so do we all do this?
- Yeah. Yeah.

16:59.936 --> 17:01.642
You guys ready?

17:01.855 --> 17:03.470
- Yeah.
- Yes.

17:10.489 --> 17:12.275
Where's Dr. Deaton?

17:20.332 --> 17:21.287
What?

17:21.500 --> 17:22.865
Aren't you gonna answer it?

17:24.461 --> 17:25.621
Oh, I don't know the answer.

17:25.921 --> 17:28.583
I thought we were asking
some sort of spirit.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.300
Well, do you know any spirits?

17:32.886 --> 17:34.672
Is she for real?

17:45.774 --> 17:48.015
Do you know
what a metronome is, Scott?

17:48.443 --> 17:50.855
It's a tool to help you
maintain a steady rhythm

17:51.071 --> 17:52.607
once you've set the tempo.

17:53.323 --> 17:56.110
Something tells me the tempo of your life

17:56.326 --> 17:58.942
has sped up considerably
in the last few hours.

17:59.746 --> 18:04.490
If you'd like, I could help slow it down
to a more manageable pace.

18:05.126 --> 18:06.206
How?

18:07.629 --> 18:09.790
By helping you find Deaton.

18:10.173 --> 18:12.550
Okay, these are Deaton's keys for the clinic.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.966
Close your eyes,
and I'm gonna put 'em in your hand,

18:15.178 --> 18:17.510
and then we're just gonna try and see
if you can feel out for his location.

18:17.722 --> 18:19.223
It's called psychometry.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.093
I'm not a psychic.

18:22.102 --> 18:26.266
You're something! Okay?
Just... Lydia, put out your hand and...

18:33.655 --> 18:35.316
- What?
- They're cold.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.611
Lydia, concentrate. Please.

18:38.827 --> 18:41.409
Trying to save lives here.
For the love of God.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.871
Yeah, what is it?
What do you see?

18:54.801 --> 18:55.790
Nothing.

19:01.516 --> 19:04.633
Your heart's pounding, but it's not fear.

19:05.228 --> 19:06.604
It's anger.

19:06.855 --> 19:09.141
I bet I know what you're thinking.

19:09.357 --> 19:12.815
Does he have something to do
with Deaton's disappearance?

19:13.778 --> 19:15.109
Tell you what.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.187
If you can take the cane away from me,

19:17.407 --> 19:19.693
I'll tell you exactly where he is.

19:19.951 --> 19:21.111
Now, what do you think?

19:45.393 --> 19:46.803
Impressive.

19:47.395 --> 19:50.102
But you know I'm not the one
slashing up innocent people,

19:50.273 --> 19:53.140
praying to ancient gods, gathering herbs,

19:53.360 --> 19:55.396
or whatever the hell
druids are supposed to do.

19:55.612 --> 19:58.945
lam part of a pack
that wants Derek dead, though.

19:59.157 --> 20:01.569
Kali is coming for him.

20:01.785 --> 20:04.618
So there's a difficult choice
you're about to face,

20:05.330 --> 20:07.116
because someone is going to die tonight.

20:07.332 --> 20:09.664
And whether that's Derek or Deaton,

20:10.001 --> 20:11.707
that's up to you.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.751
Just tell me where he is.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.707
I'll give you a very important clue.

20:19.052 --> 20:21.134
Let the current guide you.

20:30.188 --> 20:31.644
Automatic writing?

20:46.830 --> 20:48.821
Lydia, what are you doing?
What the hell is that?

20:49.124 --> 20:50.159
A tree.

20:51.543 --> 20:52.828
A tr...

20:53.586 --> 20:55.247
Lydia, you're supposed to be writing words,

20:55.463 --> 20:57.454
like in sentences,
something like a location,

20:57.674 --> 20:59.084
something that would tell us where he is.

20:59.259 --> 21:00.339
Well, maybe you should've said that.

21:00.552 --> 21:01.917
Isn't she supposed to be
some kind of genius?

21:02.137 --> 21:03.343
Genius, yes.

21:04.347 --> 21:06.429
Psychic, no.

21:06.891 --> 21:08.973
Honestly, I don't know why you're
even bothering with me anyway.

21:09.310 --> 21:12.097
Especially since it's obvious
you should be talking to Danny.

21:12.355 --> 21:14.186
Wait, what? Why Danny?

21:14.816 --> 21:18.274
Because last night, he was a target.

21:20.321 --> 21:21.982
But he wasn't a sacrifice.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.615
The problem with no ligature marks
around the neck

21:29.831 --> 21:32.868
is that both doctors were still asphyxiated.
So the question is...

21:33.084 --> 21:34.870
How did they suffocate
if they weren't strangled?

21:35.128 --> 21:36.163
Right.

21:36.379 --> 21:39.291
Now, take a look at the wrist marks.

21:40.216 --> 21:42.878
- What do they tell you?
- His hands were tied.

21:43.094 --> 21:45.756
Not just tied.
Look how deep they go.

21:46.222 --> 21:48.429
I don't think that's just
from struggling to get out.

21:48.767 --> 21:50.177
I think he was suspended.

21:50.351 --> 21:53.559
Hanging like that, that means they
would have to keep lifting their bodies up

21:53.772 --> 21:55.012
in order to breathe.

21:55.231 --> 21:57.517
Eventually, they would lose strength

21:57.734 --> 22:00.146
and they wouldn't be able
to lift themselves up.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.276
It's how people used to die from crucifixion.

22:02.489 --> 22:04.025
So you think Deaton is
somewhere right now,

22:04.199 --> 22:05.564
hanging by his wrists?

22:05.784 --> 22:07.149
Yeah.

22:07.327 --> 22:10.285
And when he no longer has the strength
to pull himself up to catch a breath...

22:11.664 --> 22:13.200
How long before he dies?

22:13.833 --> 22:15.118
Minutes.

22:24.052 --> 22:25.508
But isn't Danny still in the hospital?

22:25.720 --> 22:26.835
Yeah. That's where we're going right now.

22:27.055 --> 22:28.761
- I'll meet you there.
- Why?

22:37.357 --> 22:38.847
Is this gonna kill him?

22:39.984 --> 22:41.269
lhopeso.

22:42.612 --> 22:45.399
So I was looking through one of his drawers,
and I found this.

22:46.533 --> 22:48.069
He wasn't supposed to be back yet.

22:48.284 --> 22:49.820
What do I do?
Where do I go?

23:19.190 --> 23:20.566
What are you doing?

23:21.776 --> 23:22.936
Nothing.

23:24.946 --> 23:26.436
Part of you is doing something.

23:28.324 --> 23:29.279
Oh.

23:29.701 --> 23:30.816
Sorry.

23:34.789 --> 23:37.701
- Stop.
- I kind of don't have control over that.

23:38.877 --> 23:40.538
Okay, well, let me turn around.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.289
Yeah, totally.

23:46.968 --> 23:47.957
Allison.

23:48.344 --> 23:49.459
What?

23:50.263 --> 23:51.628
That's worse.

24:32.931 --> 24:34.341
See this map?

24:34.515 --> 24:36.801
Last time we were in here talking,
my dad put a book over it.

24:37.018 --> 24:40.101
There was something about the way he did it.
It was like he was trying to cover it.

24:42.065 --> 24:43.475
I don't see anything.

24:43.775 --> 24:46.608
Yeah, you can't until you use this.

24:48.863 --> 24:50.774
He's been tracking and marking everything.

24:51.324 --> 24:53.030
Cora and Boyd at the bank,

24:53.242 --> 24:55.198
the Alphas in the penthouse above us,

24:56.079 --> 24:57.410
all of the dead bodies.

24:57.914 --> 25:00.371
He has a symbol for
where someone was taken,

25:00.625 --> 25:03.037
and then a different mark
for where the bodies are found, see?

25:03.336 --> 25:04.621
Now here's the scary part.

25:05.046 --> 25:07.253
There have been six sacrifices, right?

25:09.175 --> 25:11.257
There are 12 markings on the map.

25:11.886 --> 25:13.171
What?

25:15.932 --> 25:19.015
What does that mean? Did your dad find
other bodies and not tell anyone?

25:19.227 --> 25:20.842
I don't think so.

25:21.562 --> 25:23.598
I think he knows

25:23.815 --> 25:26.022
where the bodies are going to be found.

25:26.609 --> 25:28.850
So one of these six locations, one of these,

25:29.070 --> 25:30.731
is where Deaton could end up.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.112
I mean, it doesn't tell us
where he's being kept right now, but...

25:33.324 --> 25:35.610
- But it's close to figuring it out.
- Yeah.

26:00.852 --> 26:01.967
Hey.

26:03.563 --> 26:05.770
I didn't hear you come in.

26:06.315 --> 26:07.771
Yeah, I was just doing some homework.

26:32.842 --> 26:34.298
Danny, you awake?

26:37.472 --> 26:38.632
Danny?

26:45.021 --> 26:46.056
Wow.

26:58.159 --> 26:59.524
What are you doing?

27:01.579 --> 27:04.070
I'm not doing anything, Danny.

27:04.290 --> 27:07.282
This is just a dream that you're having.

27:12.340 --> 27:14.672
Why are you going through my stuff?

27:16.886 --> 27:20.299
Right, but only in the dream, remember?

27:21.099 --> 27:22.305
Dream.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.261
You're dreaming.

27:25.853 --> 27:29.596
Why would I dream about
you going through my stuff?

27:29.774 --> 27:31.184
I don't know that, Danny, okay?

27:31.400 --> 27:33.436
It's your dream.
Take responsibility for it.

27:33.653 --> 27:35.393
Shut up and go back to sleep.

27:44.372 --> 27:46.988
Oh, Danny boy, you might've
actually found something here.

27:47.208 --> 27:49.073
Deaton's got to be
at one of the six locations,

27:49.252 --> 27:50.458
but they're all over town.

27:50.670 --> 27:52.126
I don't know how we can get
to all of them fast enough.

27:52.338 --> 27:53.418
Well, we might not have to.

27:53.589 --> 27:56.251
Danny was doing a project
on something for Mr. Harris' physics class,

27:56.467 --> 27:57.843
and I think it actually means something.

27:58.052 --> 27:59.007
What project?

27:59.220 --> 28:02.303
Something on telluric currents.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.306
- Did you say currents?
- Yeah.

28:11.816 --> 28:14.774
Isn't the light on that supposed to be on?

28:16.154 --> 28:17.109
Yeah.

28:17.446 --> 28:18.902
What does it mean if it's not?

28:19.699 --> 28:21.690
Someone cut the auxiliary power.

28:22.034 --> 28:23.410
What about the main...

28:45.808 --> 28:46.923
Derek.

28:49.937 --> 28:51.222
What do we do now?

28:55.651 --> 28:57.027
We fight.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.786
Gonna be honest, Derek.

29:13.002 --> 29:14.037
When Ennis died,

29:14.253 --> 29:17.165
I thought to myself I'd just go for it.

29:18.174 --> 29:20.290
Find you and kill you,

29:20.718 --> 29:21.878
wherever you stood.

29:22.261 --> 29:25.674
Then I remembered
how you surround yourself

29:25.848 --> 29:29.056
with these teenagers, hiding behind them,

29:29.268 --> 29:33.261
and I thought,
"What's a girl got to do to get you alone?"

29:42.448 --> 29:45.485
You and me, Derek, or they fear her apart.

29:45.743 --> 29:49.031
What do you say?
You think you can beat me one-on-one?

29:59.006 --> 30:01.748
I'm gonna rip your throat out with my teeth.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.300
Okay, so, what does this kid's homework
have to do with finding Deaton?

30:09.517 --> 30:11.178
Because it's not just homework, okay?

30:11.394 --> 30:14.477
It's a project on geomagnetic fields.
They flow through the earth.

30:14.689 --> 30:16.850
They can even be affected
by lunar phases, all right?

30:17.066 --> 30:18.055
Now, look at this.

30:18.276 --> 30:20.267
This is a note from Harris
on Danny's proposal.

30:20.695 --> 30:22.606
"I strongly advise you to
choose another subject.

30:22.863 --> 30:24.899
"The ideas here,
while innovative and thoughtful,

30:25.116 --> 30:26.481
"border on pseudo-science.

30:26.701 --> 30:28.111
"Not suitable for class."

30:28.327 --> 30:29.737
Harris wasn't just a sacrifice.

30:29.912 --> 30:31.493
- He knew something.
- Now, check this out.

30:31.789 --> 30:34.155
Allison's dad wasn't the only
one with a map, all right?

30:34.375 --> 30:36.240
Danny had one, too.

30:38.796 --> 30:40.752
Danny marked all
the telluric currents, okay?

30:40.923 --> 30:43.790
Now, the weird thing about Beacon Hills
is that it actually is a beacon.

30:43.968 --> 30:46.801
You wouldn't believe how much energy
flowing through this earth is around this town.

30:47.013 --> 30:48.844
Stiles, look, they match.

30:50.016 --> 30:51.472
All right, there's three places, right?

30:51.684 --> 30:54.517
Where they're kidnapped, and then
the place where their body was found.

30:54.729 --> 30:56.435
Look, that's right on the telluric current.

30:56.647 --> 30:59.024
So, maybe where he was sacrificed
is somewhere in between.

30:59.233 --> 31:00.188
Let me see that.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.145
You said there's six more bodies
to be found.

31:02.361 --> 31:04.317
Deaton's one of them.
Got to be somewhere in between, right?

31:04.530 --> 31:05.690
Stop.

31:09.994 --> 31:11.234
He's in the vault.

31:11.871 --> 31:13.702
He's in the same vault.

31:30.681 --> 31:32.421
- Guys, hold on.
- Lydia, we don't have time.

31:32.641 --> 31:34.677
It's Boyd.
The plan didn't work.

31:35.478 --> 31:36.809
They cut the power.

31:42.318 --> 31:43.603
It's just like he said.

31:46.072 --> 31:47.903
Go. I can save Deaton myself.

31:48.115 --> 31:49.104
What? Scott, what about us?

31:49.325 --> 31:51.031
Cora can't get there
fast enough without you.

31:51.243 --> 31:53.108
Go. We can save both of them.

31:53.621 --> 31:54.576
All right, let's go.

33:12.950 --> 33:14.315
Derek!

33:15.619 --> 33:16.608
No!

33:17.121 --> 33:18.110
Wait!

34:28.526 --> 34:31.108
Scott! Let me give it a shot.

34:38.327 --> 34:39.692
Okay, what do we do?

34:40.162 --> 34:42.198
We pull them.
We pull all of them.

35:08.816 --> 35:10.056
Take him!

35:47.855 --> 35:50.141
I'm giving you till the next full moon, Derek.

35:50.399 --> 35:51.935
Make the smart choice.

35:52.318 --> 35:53.808
Join the pack.

35:55.863 --> 35:58.070
Or next time I'm killing all of you.

36:18.010 --> 36:19.250
It's okay.

36:20.012 --> 36:22.799
No, no. No, it's not.
It's not.

36:23.015 --> 36:24.676
It's all okay, Derek.

36:27.603 --> 36:29.468
I'm sorry.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.271
The full moon.

36:36.070 --> 36:37.606
That feeling.

36:47.623 --> 36:49.579
Did you know it was the lunar eclipse?

36:52.670 --> 36:54.285
| always wondered what...

36:55.923 --> 36:58.460
What that felt like for one of us.

36:59.718 --> 37:01.094
For a werewolf.

37:03.972 --> 37:05.052
Boyd,

37:06.433 --> 37:09.470
what do you think will happen
to us on the lunar eclipse?

37:11.313 --> 37:13.474
They can last for hours, you know?

37:15.192 --> 37:17.308
Because it's just the earth's shadow.

37:20.030 --> 37:22.146
I wonder what will happen to us.

37:24.910 --> 37:26.901
Maybe it'll make us stronger.

37:32.710 --> 37:34.621
I hope it'll make us stronger.

37:51.770 --> 37:52.850
Boyd.

38:50.120 --> 38:53.157
If you know something about him
and you're reluctant to tell me,

38:53.624 --> 38:56.036
try remembering it's a long list
of favors and penance

38:56.251 --> 38:58.458
before you're redeemed in my eyes.

39:02.883 --> 39:04.874
You're gonna tell me the story,

39:05.844 --> 39:07.835
and you're gonna tell me the truth.

39:24.780 --> 39:26.645
Surprised to see me?

39:26.907 --> 39:30.070
Only surprised that it's taken you this long.

39:40.504 --> 39:41.869
How'd you find us?

39:42.798 --> 39:44.709
The vials in the clinic

39:44.967 --> 39:46.832
with the Celtic symbols on 'em.

39:47.094 --> 39:50.177
I knew that one of 'em looked familiar.

39:53.308 --> 39:56.471
Sheriff, thank you for being
one hell of a detective.

39:57.521 --> 40:00.308
You bet. Let's get you an ambulance.

40:02.818 --> 40:05.309
Your eyes were red.

40:06.905 --> 40:09.317
- Bright red.
- How is that possible?

40:09.533 --> 40:12.240
Paramedics are on their way.
I'll be back in half a minute.

40:13.579 --> 40:14.534
It's rare.

40:14.746 --> 40:17.158
It's something that doesn't
happen within 100 years,

40:17.374 --> 40:18.830
but every once in a while,

40:19.042 --> 40:20.782
a Beta can become an Alpha

40:21.003 --> 40:24.291
without having to steal or take that power.

40:24.673 --> 40:27.005
They call it a true Alpha.

40:27.217 --> 40:30.926
It's one who rises purely on
the strength of character,

40:31.138 --> 40:33.971
by virtue, by sheer force of will.

40:39.146 --> 40:40.977
You knew this would happen.

40:41.356 --> 40:42.892
I believed.

40:44.318 --> 40:47.776
From the moment I knew
you were bitten, I believed.

40:56.371 --> 40:58.236
You're not the only one.

41:00.918 --> 41:01.998
No.

41:03.170 --> 41:05.536
Deucalion isn't after Derek.

41:09.343 --> 41:10.833
He's after you.
