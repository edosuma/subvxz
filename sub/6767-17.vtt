00:05.714 --> 00:07.006
{\an3}David, I know you're
anxious to go see Donna,

00:07.090 --> 00:08.425
{\an3}so go ahead
and close up.

00:08.508 --> 00:10.176
{\an1}All right, thanks.
Good night.

00:10.260 --> 00:11.928
{\an3}Good night.

00:12.011 --> 00:13.847
Hi. I'm Chloe Davis.

00:13.930 --> 00:15.390
I was one of the
back-up singers.

00:15.473 --> 00:16.599
Ah. Hi. David.

00:16.683 --> 00:17.934
{\an3}Uh, you did
a good job.

00:18.017 --> 00:19.602
{\an4}Thanks.
Well, you
should hear

00:19.686 --> 00:21.479
my original stuff;
I write songs.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.231
Really? Uh... why don't
you just, uh...

00:23.314 --> 00:25.316
drop off a demo tape,
and I'll listen to it?

00:25.400 --> 00:27.694
Seriously? Y-You'll
listen to my tape?

00:27.777 --> 00:30.488
Yeah, yeah, just drop it off.

00:30.572 --> 00:31.656
Yes! Thank you.

00:31.740 --> 00:32.656
Sure.

00:32.741 --> 00:34.284
Thanks.

00:37.036 --> 00:38.288
Good night.
Good night.

00:39.372 --> 00:41.666
Well, I'm done for the night.
Need anything else?

00:41.750 --> 00:44.627
Yeah, I might.

00:46.921 --> 00:49.340
Oh...

00:49.424 --> 00:52.469
{\an1}I have hockey practice
in less than five hours.

00:52.552 --> 00:53.845
You know that charity game

00:53.928 --> 00:55.513
{\an1}you wanted me
to play with Brandon,

00:55.597 --> 00:56.514
so we can kiss and make up?

00:56.598 --> 00:58.600
{\an1}I'm gonna need some sleep
if you want me to win.

00:58.683 --> 01:00.602
I don't care who wins.

01:00.685 --> 01:01.728
As long as you do.

01:01.811 --> 01:03.438
{\an3}Meaning?

01:03.521 --> 01:05.522
{\an1}What am I, your
boy-toy here?

01:05.607 --> 01:07.525
{\an1}You want me when
you want me?

01:07.609 --> 01:09.527
Something like that.

01:09.611 --> 01:10.612
{\an1}Well, it doesn't
always work that way.

01:10.695 --> 01:12.280
No?

01:12.363 --> 01:13.448
No.

01:13.531 --> 01:15.492
Well, I think it's
working just fine.

01:36.554 --> 01:37.680
Donna?

01:37.764 --> 01:41.643
Uh... I-I can't sleep.

01:41.726 --> 01:43.812
You mean you are standing guard.

01:43.895 --> 01:47.315
Everything is locked, and it
was the last time you checked.

01:47.398 --> 01:48.274
Look, Slan tried to rape me,

01:48.358 --> 01:50.819
and I just can't believe
after only two years

01:50.902 --> 01:52.195
he's free to come
after me again.

01:52.278 --> 01:54.030
You have a restraining order.

01:54.113 --> 01:56.449
If he comes near you,
he breaks the law.

01:56.533 --> 01:57.909
He goes to jail.

01:57.992 --> 01:59.244
No.

02:01.496 --> 02:05.375
No, he's out there,
and he wants me to know it.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.755
♪ ♪

02:37.156 --> 02:39.200
♪ ♪

03:03.016 --> 03:04.893
♪ ♪

03:14.152 --> 03:17.155
(alarm ringing)

03:23.870 --> 03:24.787
Is it morning?

03:24.871 --> 03:26.581
Sort of.

03:26.664 --> 03:28.416
I gotta go to
hockey practice.

03:28.499 --> 03:30.793
{\an3}Wait. I'm gonna
get up too.

03:30.877 --> 03:31.920
No, no, no. Stay in bed.

03:32.003 --> 03:33.671
Sleep as late as you want.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.131
Steve's the guy

03:35.214 --> 03:37.300
to talk to for
omelets, and, uh...

03:37.383 --> 03:39.928
Valerie's your ticket
to the cappuccino machine.

03:40.011 --> 03:41.679
No, wait, this is the first
time I've slept here.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.640
I don't, I don't want
to see them without you.

03:43.723 --> 03:44.557
What are you talking about?

03:44.641 --> 03:46.476
Steve and Valerie
are crazy about you.

03:46.559 --> 03:47.769
Oh, they are, huh?

03:47.852 --> 03:48.811
{\an1}Yeah,

03:48.895 --> 03:51.022
they are.

03:51.105 --> 03:52.190
I'll see you later.

03:52.273 --> 03:53.483
Bye.

04:14.796 --> 04:18.257
(overlapping shouts)

04:35.608 --> 04:37.360
Sorry about that, man.
I feel like I've got

04:37.443 --> 04:39.362
{\an1}a few splinters from
your stick in my jersey.

04:39.445 --> 04:40.989
Oh, you're too fast
for your own good.

04:41.072 --> 04:42.407
I think you may want
to pick up your jock strap.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.701
{\an1}You left it back
there by the blue line.

04:44.784 --> 04:48.204
{\an3}This is gonna be fun
playing with you, Walsh.

04:48.287 --> 04:49.622
Yeah.

04:52.583 --> 04:54.961
Skate it out and do some
two-on-ones. Let's go!

04:57.755 --> 04:59.382
Hey, Steve!

04:59.465 --> 05:00.383
{\an1}What's up?

05:00.466 --> 05:02.552
{\an3}You forgot your notes
for your Poli Sci paper.

05:02.635 --> 05:03.594
{\an3}Tracy gave them to me.
Oh, thanks.

05:03.678 --> 05:04.637
{\an1}Can you leave them up
in the locker room, for me?

05:04.721 --> 05:07.015
{\an6}Sure.
So, you saw Trace
this morning, huh?

05:07.098 --> 05:08.558
Yes, I did.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.893
{\an3}I said good morning.
She blushed. Very cute.

05:10.977 --> 05:11.894
Mm-hmm.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.771
Is that Tom?

05:13.855 --> 05:15.064
BRANDON:
Yeah.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.566
{\an3}Boy, the guy
can skate, huh?

05:16.649 --> 05:18.568
{\an1}It's not his skating
I'm worried about.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.236
You boys play
nice now, huh?

05:20.319 --> 05:21.320
{\an3}I'm trying.
I gotta go.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.573
I got important
things to do.

05:26.868 --> 05:30.580
{\an5}DONNA:
<i>Now, Mom and Dad,</i>
<i>don't worry, David's here.</i>

05:30.663 --> 05:34.917
Don't cut the vacation
short, I'm fine.

05:35.001 --> 05:38.588
No. No calls, no messages,
nothing since we served the guy

05:38.671 --> 05:40.882
with the temporary
restraining order.

05:40.965 --> 05:44.427
Yes. Yes, the lawyer
you hired is great.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.095
We're gonna go
to court today.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.431
{\an1}We're gonna get the
permanent restraining order.

05:48.514 --> 05:51.392
Okay. Don't worry, I will...

05:51.476 --> 05:54.479
{\an1}Yes, Dad, I will call as soon
as it's over. I promise.

05:54.562 --> 05:55.938
I love you both.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.483
Okay. Bye.

05:59.317 --> 06:02.904
They're worried?

06:02.987 --> 06:05.281
Well, if they knew
the permanent restraining order

06:05.364 --> 06:07.784
wasn't a done deal, they'd
be on the next plane home,

06:07.867 --> 06:10.411
and if they knew
the temporary restraining order

06:10.495 --> 06:12.622
runs out today,
they'd be on the Concorde.

06:12.705 --> 06:14.499
(chuckles)

06:14.582 --> 06:17.251
Ah... Don't worry.

06:17.335 --> 06:18.920
We'll get the permanent
restraining order.

06:19.003 --> 06:22.965
Even if we do...
it's no guarantee.

06:23.049 --> 06:27.804
Look, Donna, after spending
all that time in jail,

06:27.887 --> 06:29.806
I don't think Slan's gonna be
all that eager

06:29.889 --> 06:30.807
to go back, you know?

06:30.890 --> 06:35.103
All I know is that I'm scared.

06:35.186 --> 06:36.562
I can still feel

06:36.646 --> 06:39.315
his hands around my neck.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.325
Whoo. Thanks.

06:49.408 --> 06:52.161
{\an3}Well, you were
up early.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.163
{\an3}I felt for you when
Brandon's alarm went off

06:54.247 --> 06:55.623
at 5:00 a.m.

06:55.706 --> 06:57.708
{\an1}You can hear Brandon's
alarm in your room?

06:57.792 --> 06:58.751
{\an3}Well, among
other things.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.711
You could not hear.

07:00.795 --> 07:02.004
{\an3}No. I'm just
kidding,

07:02.088 --> 07:04.841
but things must be
going pretty well.

07:04.924 --> 07:07.343
{\an3}I mean, you take him up to
your family ranch, and he has

07:07.426 --> 07:09.011
you spend the night here.

07:09.095 --> 07:11.013
{\an3}I know Brandon doesn't
take these things lightly.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.348
Neither do I.

07:12.431 --> 07:14.642
I have a good feeling
about this,

07:14.725 --> 07:16.978
but I don't want to jinx it
by talking about it.

07:17.061 --> 07:19.355
That feeling? It's love.

07:19.438 --> 07:21.357
{\an3}You're in love
with him.

07:21.440 --> 07:23.317
Does he know how you feel?

07:23.401 --> 07:25.319
I haven't said anything.

07:25.403 --> 07:26.487
Good. Don't.

07:26.571 --> 07:27.697
Why?

07:27.780 --> 07:29.157
{\an3}Well, take
it from me.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.200
Just keep it to yourself.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.869
Never, ever say it first--

07:32.952 --> 07:34.203
{\an3}if you have
the misfortune

07:34.287 --> 07:35.454
of feeling it at all.

07:38.457 --> 07:40.334
STEVE:
<i>Hey!</i>

07:40.418 --> 07:41.502
Sorry I'm late.

07:41.586 --> 07:42.503
Hi, baby.
Hi.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.046
{\an3}Mmm. You look
gorgeous.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.840
{\an3}You don't look so bad
yourself over there, Kelly.

07:45.923 --> 07:46.966
Thanks-- I think.

07:47.049 --> 07:49.385
Although it's been so long since
I've had a compliment

07:49.468 --> 07:50.720
from a guy, I don't know.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.096
Please. You could have

07:52.180 --> 07:54.015
{\an3}any man you want-- except
Clare's, of course.

07:54.098 --> 07:55.141
Good save.

07:55.224 --> 07:56.184
{\an3}CLARE:
Where you been?

07:56.267 --> 07:56.893
{\an6}STEVE:
I was over at the
ice skating rink.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.227
{\an3}I went to check
out Brandon.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.604
How many teams is he on?

07:59.687 --> 08:01.564
This one's just
for fun, Clare.

08:01.647 --> 08:03.191
{\an3}Well, it was, until
Tom took the ice.

08:03.274 --> 08:06.277
Oh? Tom Miller?

08:06.360 --> 08:08.404
{\an5}You know what Tom.
KELLY:
Oh, right.

08:08.487 --> 08:10.114
Tom-from-Buffalo Tom.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.491
I like him. He's cute.

08:12.575 --> 08:13.951
Val's Tom.

08:14.035 --> 08:15.369
That was high school.

08:15.453 --> 08:16.871
{\an6}STEVE:
Well, they're
still close.

08:16.954 --> 08:18.581
Well, people make mistakes.

08:18.664 --> 08:20.958
{\an1}He made his
at an early age.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.002
Kel, they're still <i> really</i> close.

08:24.587 --> 08:27.256
{\an1}Steve. I have
a proposition for you.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.925
{\an3}Well, propose away,
but I gotta tell you,

08:29.008 --> 08:30.635
it doesn't matter.
I'm already yours.

08:30.718 --> 08:34.597
You. Me. A couple of days alone
at a romantic private bungalow.

08:34.679 --> 08:35.932
{\an1}We'd be house-
sitting for this

08:36.015 --> 08:38.058
professor friend
of my father's. Sound good?

08:38.142 --> 08:40.102
Well, if I planned on
bringing any clothes,

08:40.186 --> 08:41.270
I'd be packed and ready.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.480
{\an3}You're on, Arnold.
(giggles)

08:42.563 --> 08:44.398
Excuse me, excuse me.
Sorry.

08:44.482 --> 08:45.942
{\an3}Hey, what have you
got there, Nat?

08:46.025 --> 08:47.401
{\an6}NAT:
Oh, it's a tape
for David.

08:47.485 --> 08:48.778
This girl named Chloe came by.

08:48.861 --> 08:50.613
Said he was anxious to hear it.
I'll, uh...

08:50.696 --> 08:51.614
take it to the house.

08:51.697 --> 08:52.990
I've been meaning to drop by.

08:53.074 --> 08:55.076
Oh, cool. Thanks.

08:55.159 --> 08:56.744
Since Tom moved in?

08:56.827 --> 09:00.122
Since Mark moved out.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.250
{\an1}I have some things up there
I would like back.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.043
Thank you.

09:07.546 --> 09:08.798
Hmm...
Hmm!

09:08.881 --> 09:10.341
(chuckles)

09:15.554 --> 09:16.472
{\an1}Valerie.

09:16.555 --> 09:17.557
Kelly.

09:19.308 --> 09:20.393
Valerie!

09:22.478 --> 09:24.272
{\an3}What?

09:24.355 --> 09:25.439
I just parked next to you.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.942
Right next to me.

09:28.025 --> 09:30.987
Did you wake up on the wrong
side of the bed?

09:31.070 --> 09:32.071
The side without a man?

09:32.154 --> 09:33.656
Don't do this.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.116
I am warning you.

09:35.199 --> 09:37.618
I understand. I'm not having
a great day myself.

09:37.702 --> 09:38.828
Didn't sleep much last night.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.038
I don't even remotely care
about what you're talking about.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.291
You know, I don't think Brandon
and Tracy slept much either,

09:43.374 --> 09:45.251
{\an4}if you know
what I mean.
Why do you do this?

09:45.334 --> 09:46.377
For fun.

09:46.460 --> 09:47.420
Hope your day improves.

09:47.503 --> 09:48.504
Mine has.

09:54.302 --> 09:57.013
I've asked you all to meet
with me here in chambers today

09:57.096 --> 10:00.016
based on the sensitive nature
of this particular complaint.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.559
Your Honor, with
all due respect,

10:01.642 --> 10:04.645
my client is trying
to remake his life.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.522
Granting of this order
will make him the focus

10:06.605 --> 10:08.858
{\an1}of a variety of investigations
which have no relation

10:08.941 --> 10:10.234
to Mr. Slan.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.194
He's suffered enough
for what he's done.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.030
JUDGE:
So has Ms. Martin.

10:14.113 --> 10:16.741
Now, I have reviewed
the police report

10:16.824 --> 10:18.367
as well as the
affidavits presented

10:18.451 --> 10:20.411
by the complaintant
and the respondent,

10:20.494 --> 10:22.371
and I'm ready
to make my decision.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.414
Ms. Martin.

10:23.497 --> 10:24.540
Yes?

10:24.623 --> 10:26.876
I can understand
you being afraid,

10:26.959 --> 10:30.421
based on Mr. Slan's history
and on the timing of his release

10:30.504 --> 10:32.298
coinciding with the recent
threatening activity,

10:32.381 --> 10:36.302
but a coincidence
is a coincidence.

10:36.385 --> 10:37.887
It is not evidence

10:37.970 --> 10:39.764
of his wrongdoing.
Oh, no.

10:39.847 --> 10:40.806
Therefore I'm going to deny

10:40.890 --> 10:42.683
your request for a permanent
restraining order.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.226
{\an5}DAVID:
But the temporary
order's up today.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.520
{\an6}We gotta keep this guy
away from her.
David, please.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.272
I'm sorry, Your Honor,

10:48.356 --> 10:50.066
but you can understand
Mr. Silver's concern.

10:50.149 --> 10:52.234
Mr. Slan has served his time.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.903
He's a free man.

10:53.986 --> 10:57.031
But I'm warning you, Mr. Slan.
If counsel shows me any evidence

10:57.114 --> 11:00.534
that you have threatened,
harassed or endangered

11:00.618 --> 11:01.952
Ms. Martin in any way,

11:02.036 --> 11:04.622
I'll throw the book at you,
and I will not miss.

11:08.876 --> 11:11.003
We are adjourned.

11:12.129 --> 11:12.922
{\an1}This can't
be happening.

11:13.005 --> 11:14.548
{\an1}He's free; he can
do whatever he wants.

11:14.632 --> 11:15.925
Don't worry,
he won't hurt you, all right?

11:16.008 --> 11:17.885
I promise.

11:17.968 --> 11:19.512
{\an5}(quietly):
You stay away
from her,

11:19.595 --> 11:21.597
{\an3}or I swear to God,
I'll kill you.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.697
(knocking)

11:40.866 --> 11:42.326
Hi, Tom.

11:42.410 --> 11:43.619
{\an1}Hi.

11:43.702 --> 11:45.246
I'm sorry, did I catch you

11:45.329 --> 11:47.081
{\an3}on the way to the
shower or something?

11:47.164 --> 11:48.833
No, uh, pool actually,

11:48.916 --> 11:50.709
but no matter. Come on in.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.798
Uh, this is a tape for David.

11:55.881 --> 11:57.967
{\an1}It's from a singer
at the club.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.510
{\an3}Okay, well, he's not
here right now,

11:59.593 --> 12:00.970
{\an3}but I'll give it
to him later.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.638
Great, thanks.

12:02.721 --> 12:03.848
The water's beautiful.

12:03.931 --> 12:05.474
You want to stay for a swim?

12:05.558 --> 12:07.476
It's January.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.812
It's heated.

12:09.895 --> 12:12.648
{\an3}I can't, um...
Actually, you can.

12:12.731 --> 12:13.691
Isn't that your bathing suit

12:13.774 --> 12:15.651
{\an3}hanging on the back
of the bathroom door there?

12:15.734 --> 12:18.779
Yeah, yeah.

12:18.863 --> 12:19.905
I've been meaning
to pick that up.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.950
{\an5}I left it here. I um...
You used to go
out with Mark--

12:23.033 --> 12:25.327
{\an6}the guy that used
to live here, right? Okay.
Yeah.

12:25.411 --> 12:29.665
Just like you used to be
Valerie's boyfriend, right?

12:29.748 --> 12:30.791
A long time ago.

12:30.875 --> 12:31.959
Not anymore.

12:32.042 --> 12:34.336
Hmm. That's not what I heard.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.965
Oh, so you've been asking
around about me.

12:38.048 --> 12:39.467
That's very interesting.

12:39.550 --> 12:40.676
Interesting?

12:40.759 --> 12:41.844
Well, I'm interested anyway.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.846
Are you flirting with me?

12:43.929 --> 12:45.556
Well, that depends.
Is it working?

12:45.639 --> 12:47.516
A little.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.643
So why don't you stay
for a swim? Come on.

12:49.727 --> 12:51.979
{\an6}Actually, I was on my way
to a movie.
A movie?

12:52.062 --> 12:53.981
In the middle of the day,
all by yourself?

12:54.064 --> 12:56.650
You don't go to movies
by yourself?

12:56.734 --> 12:58.736
Yeah, I do. I have
nothing against that.

12:58.819 --> 13:00.529
{\an3}It's just that
I like to go

13:00.613 --> 13:01.697
with someone, you know.

13:01.780 --> 13:03.491
So, what do you say?

13:03.574 --> 13:04.575
About what?

13:04.658 --> 13:06.702
A matinee.

13:06.785 --> 13:08.704
Can I change first?

13:08.787 --> 13:10.748
That'd be a good idea.

13:10.831 --> 13:12.833
All right.

13:24.678 --> 13:26.514
(Steve chuckling)

13:26.597 --> 13:28.390
{\an1}Isn't this
place beautiful?

13:28.474 --> 13:29.725
{\an3}The back bedroom's
completely converted

13:29.808 --> 13:31.060
into a state-of-the-art gym.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.062
A professor who lifts.
I can't believe this.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.230
Did you see the shower?

13:34.313 --> 13:35.231
Dual shower heads.

13:35.314 --> 13:36.732
{\an3}Yes, I saw those
dual shower heads.

13:36.815 --> 13:39.235
{\an1}I can't wait to get dirty
and clean up in there.

13:39.318 --> 13:40.694
And the garden.

13:40.778 --> 13:43.739
{\an3}Look, he's growing
cilantro, basil, thyme.

13:43.822 --> 13:45.407
Look, I picked turnips.

13:45.491 --> 13:46.534
{\an3}Turnips?
Mm-hmm.

13:46.617 --> 13:47.910
You'll love them.

13:47.993 --> 13:50.621
Well, maybe someday, but
currently I hate turnips.

13:50.704 --> 13:51.622
They're good with chicken.

13:51.705 --> 13:53.582
{\an1}Potatoes are good
with chicken.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.210
All right, we'll
have beets then.

13:56.293 --> 13:57.461
What, you hate beets, too?

13:57.545 --> 13:59.588
Look at 'em, they're
all ratty and dirty.

13:59.672 --> 14:03.467
{\an1}And what is that?
A... beet-hair?

14:03.551 --> 14:05.636
It's a root, Steve.

14:05.719 --> 14:07.429
It's dirty because it
comes from the ground.

14:07.513 --> 14:08.889
{\an3}That's what vegetables
are supposed to do.

14:08.973 --> 14:10.391
They should do
something else.

14:10.474 --> 14:12.935
{\an1}Go away. I want to be
alone with my girlfriend.

14:13.018 --> 14:16.272
{\an3}Are you glad we got away from
everybody for a few days?

14:16.355 --> 14:19.275
Yeah, I'm glad we have
a place to ourselves.

14:19.358 --> 14:20.985
{\an3}You don't mind
staying in tonight?

14:21.068 --> 14:23.279
'Cause if you do we could

14:23.362 --> 14:25.614
{\an3}probably call Brandon and see
what everyone's doing.

14:30.035 --> 14:32.121
{\an1}Does that answer
your question?

14:32.204 --> 14:34.498
Uh-huh.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.503
KELLY:
<i>I think I saw you crying first.</i>

14:39.587 --> 14:41.463
No, I don't think so.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.465
Seriously, I had fun.

14:43.549 --> 14:44.508
We should do it again.

14:44.592 --> 14:47.678
Wait, you want to see
the same bad movie again?

14:47.761 --> 14:51.765
No, a different bad movie.

14:51.849 --> 14:53.142
With the same me.

14:53.225 --> 14:55.811
Okay, sounds perfect.

14:55.894 --> 14:57.980
{\an3}NAT:
Hey, Kel, Tom.

14:58.063 --> 14:59.148
What can I get you?

14:59.231 --> 15:00.441
{\an1}I'll have the
cinnamon stick tea,

15:00.524 --> 15:03.152
with some milk on the side.

15:03.235 --> 15:06.155
I would like
a big piece of apple pie,

15:06.238 --> 15:08.991
with ice cream on the top
on the side, all over it.

15:09.074 --> 15:11.327
Sounds like you want a little
pie with your ice cream, huh?

15:11.410 --> 15:13.287
{\an6}Now you're talking.
You want anything
with your tea?

15:13.370 --> 15:16.624
{\an3}Hi, Val. How's it going?
Hey.

15:16.707 --> 15:18.626
(laughing)

15:20.127 --> 15:21.629
What're you guys up to?

15:21.712 --> 15:23.672
We just caught a movie.

15:23.756 --> 15:24.548
How was the film?

15:24.632 --> 15:25.883
Good.

15:25.966 --> 15:28.010
{\an4}It was fine.
KELLY:
It was fantastic.

15:28.093 --> 15:29.011
{\an3}Wait a sec,
you said

15:29.094 --> 15:30.638
it was too violent.

15:30.721 --> 15:33.891
Oh, no, I said a little violence
is good every now and then.

15:33.974 --> 15:35.351
Val, can I get
you anything?

15:35.434 --> 15:36.560
No, actually, I need Tom.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.187
One of the speakers is out,

15:38.270 --> 15:39.521
probably a loose wire.

15:39.605 --> 15:40.731
Can you take a look at it?

15:40.814 --> 15:42.149
Yeah, first thing tonight, sure.

15:42.232 --> 15:43.484
{\an3}VALERIE:
Can you do it right now?

15:43.567 --> 15:45.444
{\an3}I really want it
taken care of right away.

15:52.660 --> 15:54.203
{\an3}Should I bother
to ask which speaker,

15:54.286 --> 15:57.039
or do you just want
to get right to it?

15:57.122 --> 15:58.540
How could you go
out with Kelly?

15:58.624 --> 16:00.209
You know I hate her.

16:00.292 --> 16:01.543
She was going to the movies.

16:01.627 --> 16:02.670
She invited me along, okay?

16:02.753 --> 16:04.546
She invited you?

16:04.630 --> 16:05.547
Yeah. So what?

16:05.631 --> 16:06.507
You went, that's what.

16:06.590 --> 16:08.509
I'm sorry, I didn't know
it would hurt you.

16:08.592 --> 16:11.053
{\an3}It doesn't.
Are you sure about that?

16:11.136 --> 16:12.221
What you think I'm
threatened by her?

16:12.304 --> 16:14.223
You sure seem to be.

16:14.306 --> 16:15.891
You think she's so great?

16:15.974 --> 16:18.394
{\an1}You think she's
interested in you?

16:18.477 --> 16:20.437
Kelly and I go back a long way.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.314
She hates me as much
as I hate her.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.733
That's your history, not mine.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.068
She's just using you, Tom.

16:30.489 --> 16:33.033
You know, it's bad enough
I'm not good enough for you.

16:33.117 --> 16:35.035
Now I'm not good enough
for your worst enemy?

16:36.453 --> 16:39.581
I give up.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.715
{\an5}DONNA:
<i>I told Brandon I'm not going</i>
<i>to do the weather anymore.</i>

16:47.798 --> 16:49.925
At least for a while.

16:50.008 --> 16:52.094
I think that's a good idea.

16:52.177 --> 16:54.555
{\an3}You know, it's just--
it's not fair.

16:54.638 --> 16:57.099
{\an3}Slan goes free and I feel
like I'm in prison.

16:57.182 --> 16:59.977
You know I look around,

17:00.060 --> 17:02.438
I see women walking alone,

17:02.521 --> 17:05.148
going to their classes,
their jobs,

17:05.232 --> 17:07.401
not being afraid...

17:07.483 --> 17:08.777
like I used to be.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.280
Look, Donna, I know, I know
it's hard all right,

17:11.363 --> 17:13.156
but you've got
to be patient.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.409
I mean, you've got
to protect yourself.

17:16.868 --> 17:18.412
Come here.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.376
You better get going.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.463
{\an1}You don't want to miss that
meeting with Professor Austin.

17:27.546 --> 17:29.381
{\an3}You think she'll give
me an extension?

17:29.465 --> 17:30.424
Are you kidding?

17:30.507 --> 17:32.593
Come on, with what you've
been through, of course.

17:35.053 --> 17:37.848
Well, thanks for walking me.

17:37.931 --> 17:40.392
You know, I'm... I'm fine.

17:42.060 --> 17:43.353
Bye.

17:43.437 --> 17:44.938
Bye.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.668
Hello, Donna.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.879
Oh, my God!
Donna, look,

18:08.962 --> 18:10.047
I just want to talk to you.

18:10.130 --> 18:11.298
No.

18:11.381 --> 18:12.299
{\an3}I have every right
to be here.

18:12.382 --> 18:13.383
You heard the judge.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.011
I don't mean you any harm.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.304
Look, I tried
to talk to you

18:17.387 --> 18:18.597
this morning at court,
but David was there.

18:18.680 --> 18:21.016
You've been following me?

18:21.099 --> 18:22.893
Waiting until I was alone?

18:22.976 --> 18:24.311
I had to.

18:24.394 --> 18:25.687
Look, he's wrong about me.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.523
{\an3}If you would just listen...
No!

18:27.606 --> 18:29.858
{\an1}I need you to just...
No! You get away from me!

18:29.942 --> 18:31.360
Don't scream.
No!

18:39.493 --> 18:41.286
{\an1}I'm sorry.
David!

18:41.370 --> 18:44.081
David!
Donna, what's wrong?

18:44.164 --> 18:46.083
It's Slan! He's following me!

18:46.166 --> 18:47.334
Where's he at?

18:47.417 --> 18:48.710
Does it matter?

18:48.794 --> 18:50.212
We can't do anything.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.713
Did he hurt you? Are you okay?

18:51.797 --> 18:53.799
He said he just
wanted to talk to me.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.261
I'm sorry, Donna. He's sick.

18:57.344 --> 19:01.056
David, just hold me.

19:01.139 --> 19:04.268
(sobbing)

19:09.940 --> 19:11.024
{\an3}Hey, Tracy.
Hi.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.442
{\an3}Nice show today.
Thank you.

19:12.526 --> 19:15.112
{\an5}Oh, that was great coverage on
the women's basketball game.
Thanks.

19:15.195 --> 19:17.030
Yeah, Evan likes 'em tall.
Hey, man, shut up.

19:17.114 --> 19:19.616
{\an1}Hey, when's our hot little
weather mistress coming back?

19:19.700 --> 19:21.118
I don't know.
If I were Donna,

19:21.201 --> 19:23.078
I don't know
if I'd ever come back.

19:23.161 --> 19:25.038
I'll see you guys tomorrow.
Okay.

19:25.122 --> 19:27.249
{\an1}Hey, I'm just making one
change to tomorrow's script.

19:27.332 --> 19:27.916
What's up?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.585
Are you cutting that story?

19:29.668 --> 19:31.795
{\an1}No, I'm just moving it down
to the bottom that's all.

19:31.879 --> 19:32.921
Oh, you are a genius.
Thank you.

19:33.005 --> 19:36.425
{\an1}Oh, by the way your piece on
the demise of meritocracy?

19:36.508 --> 19:37.467
Brilliant.

19:37.551 --> 19:38.719
Thank you.

19:38.802 --> 19:40.053
Well, I've got to go.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.930
You got those pages?
Yeah, yeah, right here.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.932
So I'll see you at the game?
Thanks. Yeah, bye.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.143
I love you.

19:47.728 --> 19:49.479
Oh, no.

19:50.689 --> 19:51.940
I didn't mean that.

19:52.024 --> 19:52.941
Okay.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.276
{\an3}No, I, I,

19:54.359 --> 19:56.945
I mean, I did mean it.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.197
I just... I didn't mean
to say it.

20:02.534 --> 20:03.827
Please, say something.

20:03.911 --> 20:07.414
I don't know what to say.

20:24.056 --> 20:27.267
Home, sweet home.

20:27.351 --> 20:28.894
{\an1}I thought Donna got
the restraining order

20:28.977 --> 20:30.687
to keep Slan away.

20:30.771 --> 20:33.774
{\an1}Not so you can
have his address.

20:33.857 --> 20:34.858
{\an3}Yeah, well, at least
it's good for something.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.777
You stay here.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.320
Wait a sec, wait a sec.

20:38.403 --> 20:39.529
Are you sure you want
to go in there alone?

20:39.613 --> 20:43.492
A few years in prison, a guy can
learn a lot of nasty tricks.

20:43.575 --> 20:46.328
Just keep an eye out for me.

20:46.411 --> 20:49.998
{\an1}Who are you afraid
of getting hurt, you or him?

21:09.267 --> 21:12.187
No. No, you've been looking
for company all week.

21:12.270 --> 21:13.355
Now you've got some.

21:13.438 --> 21:14.690
{\an3}I wanted to talk
to Donna, not you.

21:14.773 --> 21:15.857
I don't want you calling her.

21:15.941 --> 21:16.858
I don't want you
sending her stuff.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.069
I don't want you going
near her, you understand?

21:19.152 --> 21:22.072
{\an5}Look, it's not me
that's going after her.
You cornered her today at C.U.

21:22.155 --> 21:23.699
Yeah, and she wouldn't
listen to me. She's in danger.

21:23.782 --> 21:25.075
Well, she's not the only one.

21:25.158 --> 21:27.536
Look, you want to protect her?

21:27.619 --> 21:29.538
Let me give you a little tip.

21:29.621 --> 21:31.623
{\an3}A guy can get
anybody he wants,

21:31.707 --> 21:34.209
if he's willing to risk
anything to do it.

21:35.335 --> 21:37.546
Are you willing to risk
anything for her?

21:37.629 --> 21:39.673
{\an3}Huh?

21:39.756 --> 21:41.550
{\an1}Police.

21:41.633 --> 21:43.343
Step back, both of you.
Hands behind your head.

21:43.427 --> 21:45.095
Hey, what's going on?
How'd you guys get here?

21:45.178 --> 21:46.596
Yeah, arrest him.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.099
Keep your mouth shut, Slan.

21:49.182 --> 21:50.851
How did you know my name?

21:50.934 --> 21:52.561
How did you know my name?!

21:52.644 --> 21:53.603
{\an3}What're you guys
watching me?!

21:53.687 --> 21:55.856
Where's your patrol car, huh?

21:55.939 --> 21:57.441
Oh, great. Oh that bitch

21:57.524 --> 21:59.067
files a complaint,

21:59.151 --> 22:00.235
so you stake me out?!

22:00.318 --> 22:02.279
Is that right?

22:02.362 --> 22:04.614
{\an3}You guys had an unmarked
cop car out here?

22:04.698 --> 22:07.701
{\an1}I'd say the operation's
pretty well marked now, okay?

22:07.784 --> 22:10.579
{\an1}You had a sympathetic
judge.

22:10.662 --> 22:11.955
Too bad you didn't trust us
to do our job.

22:12.039 --> 22:13.040
No. You know what?

22:13.123 --> 22:14.166
We filed the damn report.

22:14.249 --> 22:16.084
The police said there's nothing
they could do about it.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.919
So you decided
to do something about it.

22:18.003 --> 22:21.131
If it was your girlfriend,
wouldn't you do the same thing?

22:22.132 --> 22:23.925
{\an1}Look, I've got to go
check on my girlfriend,

22:24.009 --> 22:25.969
{\an4}okay?
Slan's inside.
He's not going

22:26.053 --> 22:28.930
anywhere, and neither are you.

22:41.359 --> 22:42.944
STEVE:
<i>This is great.</i>

22:43.028 --> 22:44.696
I love this place.

22:44.780 --> 22:46.615
{\an5}And the view
from the terrace...
Oh!

22:46.698 --> 22:48.200
{\an3}Isn't the sunset
unbelievable?

22:48.283 --> 22:49.951
Imagine coming home
and seeing that every night.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.787
I'm imagining
it right now.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.580
Oh, yeah?
What are you wearing?

22:53.663 --> 22:55.123
Oh, not much.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.084
I mean, it's our
house, after all.

22:57.167 --> 22:58.794
{\an3}No one here
but you and me.

22:58.877 --> 23:01.797
I wish we could
do this every night.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.632
Really?

23:03.715 --> 23:05.801
You'd really want
to live here together?

23:05.884 --> 23:06.760
Yeah. Sure. Why not?

23:06.843 --> 23:10.347
Because the place is ours
if we want it.

23:10.430 --> 23:12.099
{\an3}Rent-free.

23:12.182 --> 23:13.600
What? How?

23:13.683 --> 23:14.976
Professor Henley
is going on sabbatical.

23:15.060 --> 23:17.312
He's going to be in Prague
for six months.

23:17.395 --> 23:18.605
He needs someone to house-sit.

23:18.688 --> 23:20.690
{\an3}Why didn't you tell me?
I don't know.

23:20.774 --> 23:22.442
I didn't think
you'd be interested.

23:24.027 --> 23:25.362
Do you really want to do this?

23:25.445 --> 23:26.530
Live together?

23:26.613 --> 23:27.656
{\an3}Yeah.

23:27.739 --> 23:29.866
Yeah. Sure.

23:38.542 --> 23:40.836
Everything okay?

23:40.919 --> 23:42.712
{\an3}Just peachy.
Good, good, good.

23:42.796 --> 23:44.798
Like that attitude.
All right, I'm going to bed.

23:44.881 --> 23:46.049
Big game tomorrow.
Oh, that's right.

23:46.133 --> 23:47.175
The big hockey game.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.802
That's right. The
big hockey game.

23:48.885 --> 23:50.178
Anytime you get
a chance to skate

23:50.262 --> 23:52.848
with Ron Duguay and Cam Neely,
you can't say no.

23:52.931 --> 23:53.849
And don't forget
my good friend Tom.

23:53.932 --> 23:55.392
You're skating with him, too.

23:55.475 --> 23:57.269
Not anymore.
Coach split us up.

23:57.352 --> 23:58.979
We're playing
against each other now.

23:59.062 --> 24:00.730
{\an4}Good night.
Well, I'll be
rooting for you.

24:00.814 --> 24:02.691
Of course,
I can't say the same for Kelly.

24:02.774 --> 24:04.860
Kelly?

24:04.943 --> 24:06.153
Yeah. Didn't you know?

24:06.236 --> 24:08.989
She's been sharpening her claws
on Tom.

24:09.072 --> 24:10.198
Out of all the guys in L.A.,

24:10.282 --> 24:11.867
{\an1}she goes for
my old boyfriend.

24:11.950 --> 24:12.701
Are you sure about this?

24:12.784 --> 24:13.702
She asked him out,

24:13.785 --> 24:15.078
to a movie.

24:15.162 --> 24:16.204
And then dragged him
to the Peach Pit

24:16.288 --> 24:17.372
to throw it in my face.

24:17.455 --> 24:19.875
And Tom
was bound and gagged through

24:19.958 --> 24:21.376
all this, I'm sure?

24:21.459 --> 24:23.503
No. But he had a hook right here
on the side of his cheek.

24:23.587 --> 24:25.338
Val, they went to a movie.

24:25.422 --> 24:26.715
They didn't elope.

24:26.798 --> 24:28.717
Why are you defending him?

24:28.800 --> 24:29.885
{\an1}You don't
even like him.

24:29.968 --> 24:31.011
Why do guys do that
for each other?

24:31.094 --> 24:34.681
All I'm saying is, the guy's
allowed to have friends.

24:34.764 --> 24:36.266
It's not like
that with Tom.

24:36.349 --> 24:38.560
He can't be just friends
with any woman.

24:38.643 --> 24:40.687
At least not for long.

25:06.546 --> 25:09.382
Kel! Kel, wake up!

25:09.466 --> 25:10.800
{\an1}We've got to
get out of here!

25:10.884 --> 25:12.636
Get up! Hurry!

25:12.719 --> 25:14.095
What?

25:14.179 --> 25:16.890
Donna, what's going on?

25:18.808 --> 25:21.478
What's going on?

25:21.561 --> 25:22.437
Hey.

25:22.520 --> 25:23.897
Mr. Burnett.

25:23.980 --> 25:25.440
I'm sorry if I startled you.

25:25.523 --> 25:26.775
Electricity's on the fritz.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.318
{\an1}What?
Now, don't worry.

25:28.401 --> 25:29.653
I thought we
had it fixed,

25:29.736 --> 25:31.613
but I finally had
to call an electrician.

25:31.696 --> 25:33.365
You ladies okay?

25:33.448 --> 25:35.116
Fine. Yeah, we're fine.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.701
{\an3}Okay, then.
Bye.

25:46.002 --> 25:47.379
Donna...

25:52.676 --> 25:54.135
{\an3}Come on.

26:00.600 --> 26:03.603
Okay, I am drawing you a bath,

26:03.687 --> 26:05.272
{\an3}and then you're
going to bed.

26:05.355 --> 26:07.315
{\an3}I'm even going to lend you
my totally-comforting,

26:07.399 --> 26:09.651
{\an3}sleep-inducing
flannel sheets, okay?

26:09.734 --> 26:11.653
{\an3}I'm going to stay by your
side until they work.

26:11.736 --> 26:12.654
Thanks, Kel.

26:12.737 --> 26:14.739
(phone ringing)

26:16.491 --> 26:17.659
Hello.

26:17.742 --> 26:18.660
BRANDON:
Hey. It's me.

26:18.743 --> 26:20.161
Hi, me.

26:20.245 --> 26:21.288
Sorry it's so late.

26:21.371 --> 26:23.164
That's okay.

26:23.248 --> 26:24.874
I just called to say good night.

26:24.958 --> 26:27.711
Is that all?

26:29.254 --> 26:30.505
Brandon,

26:30.588 --> 26:32.173
are we okay?

26:32.257 --> 26:34.509
I thought we were doing great.

26:34.592 --> 26:36.344
Yeah. Until today.

26:36.428 --> 26:40.181
Until I said those
three infamous little words.

26:40.265 --> 26:45.353
Look, just, uh... just give it
a little time, okay?

26:45.437 --> 26:47.063
Can you do that?

26:47.147 --> 26:50.859
Yeah. I can.

26:50.942 --> 26:52.861
Good. All right,
I've got to get some sleep.

26:52.944 --> 26:53.862
Good night.

26:53.945 --> 26:56.364
Good night. Brandon?

26:56.448 --> 26:58.033
Yeah?

26:58.116 --> 26:59.951
I'm glad you called.

27:01.619 --> 27:03.455
Good night.

27:27.270 --> 27:30.023
(screaming)

27:35.695 --> 27:37.572
He was in here.

27:37.655 --> 27:39.741
Slan was here.

28:08.853 --> 28:10.063
I'm freezing.

28:10.146 --> 28:11.773
{\an1}Oh, not me.
I'm from Buffalo.

28:11.856 --> 28:13.274
{\an1}We used to go inside
the rinks to get warm.

28:13.358 --> 28:14.984
Ah! Look. There's Tom.

28:15.068 --> 28:16.945
{\an3}Uh-huh.

28:17.028 --> 28:19.322
Aren't you going
to go say hello?

28:19.406 --> 28:20.782
Oh, maybe later.

28:20.865 --> 28:23.243
{\an1}Oh, my gosh.
Look who it is.

28:23.326 --> 28:25.703
Who is that?
That's Cam Neely.

28:25.787 --> 28:28.498
He's one of the best power
forwards who ever played.

28:28.581 --> 28:30.083
And that's Ron Duguay.

28:30.166 --> 28:31.418
{\an3}He was one of the fastest
skaters in hockey.

28:31.501 --> 28:32.961
He's got incredible hair.

28:33.044 --> 28:34.963
{\an3}Is that why he
doesn't wear a helmet?

28:35.046 --> 28:36.131
{\an1}Oh, that's
the way he played.

28:36.214 --> 28:38.133
When the NHL
made helmets mandatory,

28:38.216 --> 28:40.135
{\an3}it was optional for anyone
who was already playing.

28:40.218 --> 28:41.678
{\an3}How do you know
all these things?

28:41.761 --> 28:44.848
Oh, right. It's
a Buffalo thing.

28:44.931 --> 28:46.307
Yeah.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.652
Well, I see
you're a one-player woman.

28:57.735 --> 28:59.487
Why don't you
go say hello?

28:59.571 --> 29:02.657
Mm. Maybe later.

29:02.740 --> 29:04.159
{\an1}Problems?

29:04.242 --> 29:05.160
No.

29:05.243 --> 29:07.328
{\an3}What?

29:07.412 --> 29:09.205
It's nothing.

29:09.289 --> 29:10.832
I said it.

29:10.915 --> 29:12.333
I said it first,
and he didn't say it back.

29:12.417 --> 29:14.002
All right, don't panic.

29:14.085 --> 29:15.462
Just tell him you said it
in the heat of passion.

29:15.545 --> 29:16.838
{\an3}It wasn't.

29:16.921 --> 29:18.214
All right,
tell him you thought it over,

29:18.298 --> 29:19.424
and you want to dial back.

29:19.507 --> 29:20.341
You want to see other people.

29:20.425 --> 29:22.051
{\an1}You know,
play hard to get.

29:22.135 --> 29:24.637
I don't want to play games.

29:24.721 --> 29:26.347
It seemed so right
when I said it.

29:26.431 --> 29:28.433
It was as natural
as saying his name.

29:28.516 --> 29:29.601
So how did he take it?

29:29.684 --> 29:31.311
Like he didn't know
his own name.

29:31.394 --> 29:32.854
{\an3}Hey, Tracy.

29:32.937 --> 29:35.023
Evan. Have you met Valerie?

29:35.106 --> 29:36.483
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Hi. Nice to meet <i> you.</i>

29:36.566 --> 29:39.861
{\an3}Is anybody here
from the station?

29:39.944 --> 29:41.196
{\an3}Like Rusty
or Donna or Alan?

29:41.279 --> 29:42.280
Oh, not that I know of.

29:42.363 --> 29:44.908
{\an3}I thought it was mandatory
to root for the boss.

29:44.991 --> 29:47.076
{\an3}Anyways, I'm sitting with
some friends across the way.

29:47.160 --> 29:48.077
{\an3}I'll see you guys
after the game.

29:48.161 --> 29:50.538
Okay. Bye.
Bye.

29:54.125 --> 29:57.462
Hey, I hear you're the
man to watch out here.

29:57.545 --> 29:59.631
{\an3}So what are you
waiting for? Let's go.

30:10.183 --> 30:14.395
{\an1}Hey, very cool. Ron Duguay.
Hey, Ron.

30:14.479 --> 30:15.772
Brandon Walsh. How you doing?

30:15.855 --> 30:16.898
I'm doing good, thank you.

30:18.483 --> 30:19.567
{\an6}Hey, Ron.
Hey.
Hey, listen.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.444
No talking with the enemy.
You're on <i> my</i> team.

30:21.528 --> 30:22.820
{\an1}How you doing? Cam Neely.
Hey, Cam.

30:22.904 --> 30:24.155
Brandon Walsh. Good to meet you.

30:24.239 --> 30:25.406
Nice to see you. All right,

30:25.490 --> 30:26.866
let's go get 'em.
All right, let's go.

30:28.993 --> 30:30.537
Some friendly advice.

30:30.620 --> 30:31.913
Keep your head up.

30:31.996 --> 30:33.581
Don't want to see
anyone get hurt.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.208
{\an1}Yeah. I'll try
to remember that.

30:35.291 --> 30:36.751
You try to remember to keep
your stick out of my face.

30:36.834 --> 30:38.920
{\an3}Why don't we let the refs
call the game, okay?

30:39.003 --> 30:40.046
Okay.

30:45.218 --> 30:46.094
Hey, listen, Tom.

30:46.177 --> 30:47.512
There's something
you should know, man.

30:47.595 --> 30:48.513
Let's just relax

30:48.596 --> 30:49.597
with the skating tips, okay?

30:49.681 --> 30:50.765
Remember,
we're on opposite sides.

30:50.848 --> 30:52.141
Not in this.

30:52.225 --> 30:54.310
It's about Valerie.

30:54.394 --> 30:56.271
Hey, Kelly!

30:56.354 --> 30:57.730
We're up here.

31:01.651 --> 31:03.778
Hello.

31:03.861 --> 31:06.823
{\an1}You know, I think I saw
an empty seat over there.

31:06.906 --> 31:09.867
{\an5}Oh, that's okay.
This will be
fine, but thanks.

31:13.371 --> 31:16.124
{\an1}Valerie tells me you've been
spending some time with Kelly.

31:16.207 --> 31:18.793
She wasn't too
happy about it.

31:18.876 --> 31:21.629
I know Valerie a lot better
and a lot longer than you.

31:21.713 --> 31:23.631
{\an1}Yeah, but you
don't know Kelly.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.592
You're right. I don't.

31:25.675 --> 31:27.760
{\an1}Look, she's
been through a lot,

31:27.844 --> 31:29.095
and she came out
of it all right.

31:29.178 --> 31:30.930
{\an1}I just want to make sure
she stays that way.

31:31.014 --> 31:33.141
{\an3}What are you,
her father?

31:33.224 --> 31:35.143
She's vulnerable.

31:35.226 --> 31:36.644
{\an1}You know what
I'm saying?

31:36.728 --> 31:39.647
{\an3}Who are you protecting,
Valerie or Kelly?

31:39.731 --> 31:41.691
Both.

31:41.774 --> 31:42.984
Okay. I hear you.

31:43.067 --> 31:45.820
{\an3}Thanks for filling
me in on things.

31:45.903 --> 31:48.031
{\an3}We all set?

31:48.114 --> 31:49.324
{\an1}Yeah. Good luck
today, man.

31:49.407 --> 31:50.325
{\an3}Good luck.

31:50.408 --> 31:52.827
(horn blows, whistle blows)

31:55.079 --> 31:57.457
Hey, Kelly.

32:00.251 --> 32:01.628
Hey.

32:01.711 --> 32:05.340
You looked very cute
sleeping on the couch.

32:05.423 --> 32:07.216
{\an1}You saw me?
Yeah. Donna was

32:07.300 --> 32:08.509
still up when we got back.

32:08.593 --> 32:10.511
{\an1}I heard you guys
had quite a scare.

32:10.595 --> 32:12.680
I heard you had a run-in
with the police.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.682
Yeah. It wasn't my first time.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.517
I'm okay. Are you?

32:16.601 --> 32:17.852
I'm fine.

32:17.935 --> 32:20.521
{\an3}You certainly are that.
Is this you

32:20.605 --> 32:21.689
flirting with me again?

32:21.773 --> 32:23.858
A kiss for luck would help.

32:30.323 --> 32:31.574
{\an1}COACH:
Let's go!

32:31.658 --> 32:33.326
{\an3}Miller!

32:37.288 --> 32:38.206
Good luck.

32:38.289 --> 32:40.124
Thank you.

33:04.774 --> 33:06.275
(players shouting)

33:19.163 --> 33:21.457
{\an1}Keep your head
in the game, Walsh!

33:24.293 --> 33:26.587
{\an1}MAN:
Go, go, go!

33:27.463 --> 33:29.507
{\an1}Tripping!
Come on!

33:33.553 --> 33:35.346
{\an3}MAN:
Break it up!

33:39.350 --> 33:41.144
Did you see that?

33:41.227 --> 33:42.103
{\an3}Brandon?

33:42.186 --> 33:44.230
Why would he do that?

33:44.313 --> 33:48.192
{\an5}MAN (over P.A.):
Walsh, two minutes
in the penalty box! Tripping.

33:54.031 --> 33:55.158
Hey, how was your run?

33:55.241 --> 33:56.993
{\an1}It was good.
You need a hand?

33:57.076 --> 33:58.286
No, I think I'm done.

33:58.369 --> 34:00.663
{\an3}This must be
wedding presents.

34:00.747 --> 34:03.166
{\an3}You'd never buy this kind
of stuff for yourself.

34:03.249 --> 34:06.294
Can you imagine having your own
house full of stuff like this?

34:06.377 --> 34:08.755
Now you're telling me you want
to get married?

34:08.838 --> 34:11.966
No, I'm admiring the china.

34:12.049 --> 34:13.301
I'm not gonna get married

34:13.384 --> 34:15.261
just so someone will give me
a crock pot.

34:15.344 --> 34:19.306
Good. I thought you were trying
to tell me something.

34:19.389 --> 34:21.976
Yeah, and now that you find out
that I'm not,

34:22.059 --> 34:23.268
{\an3}the blood returns
to your face.

34:23.351 --> 34:25.271
Come on. It never left.

34:25.353 --> 34:27.190
{\an3}No one's talking
marriage.

34:27.273 --> 34:29.150
We can't even decide
on living together.

34:29.233 --> 34:32.027
Hey, I thought we decided that.

34:32.110 --> 34:33.987
No, we just talked about it.

34:34.071 --> 34:35.947
You're having second thoughts
aren't you?

34:36.032 --> 34:38.159
And third and fourth.

34:38.242 --> 34:40.995
You know what?

34:41.078 --> 34:42.789
So am I.

34:44.748 --> 34:47.543
{\an6}At first I thought
it was just cause
you snore,

34:47.627 --> 34:49.212
but I snore, too.

34:49.295 --> 34:50.295
Yeah, you do.

34:50.379 --> 34:51.422
Hey,

34:51.505 --> 34:53.382
it's not as bad
as it used to be.

34:53.466 --> 34:56.010
{\an4}It's not like you
rearrange the furniture
or anything,

34:56.094 --> 34:58.763
if that's what you mean.

34:58.846 --> 35:01.349
The point is...

35:01.432 --> 35:04.560
what's the point of being
together if we know

35:04.644 --> 35:05.853
we're not gonna live together?

35:05.937 --> 35:07.688
{\an3}If we don't have
a future?

35:07.772 --> 35:09.982
Hey, we don't know that.

35:10.066 --> 35:13.986
{\an1}It just means we're
not gonna live together now.

35:14.070 --> 35:17.365
{\an3}Your second thought,
what was it?

35:17.448 --> 35:21.410
Just that we shouldn't rush
into something so important

35:21.494 --> 35:26.040
{\an1}just because someone gives us
a deal on a house.

35:26.123 --> 35:28.501
{\an1}Want to hear
my first thought?

35:28.584 --> 35:30.378
Will it hurt my feelings?

35:32.004 --> 35:34.674
I love you so much, Clare.

35:34.757 --> 35:37.677
Okay, go ahead.

35:37.760 --> 35:42.890
{\an1}That was it.
That was my first thought.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.392
So you stay

35:44.475 --> 35:47.395
where you are,
and I'll stay where I am.

35:47.478 --> 35:51.190
And we'll rendezvous
like mad.

35:51.274 --> 35:55.987
Hmm, how about a little
rendezvous action right now?

35:57.154 --> 35:58.739
{\an1}Come here.

35:58.823 --> 36:00.992
(giggles)

36:22.013 --> 36:23.681
(horn blows)

36:27.018 --> 36:29.562
It's not like Brandon
to play dirty like that.

36:29.645 --> 36:31.272
No, it isn't.

36:31.355 --> 36:32.648
Wouldn't have
anything to do

36:32.732 --> 36:34.400
{\an1}with you kissing Tom,
would it, Kel?

36:34.483 --> 36:37.778
No, it wouldn't, Valerie.

36:37.862 --> 36:39.822
I'm gonna go get warmed up.

36:39.906 --> 36:41.782
It's getting a little cold
in here for my blood.

36:41.866 --> 36:43.367
(horn blows)

36:44.535 --> 36:45.578
{\an3}Way to go.

36:45.661 --> 36:47.079
{\an3}Is that how you treat
your friends?

36:47.163 --> 36:49.415
She should know
what she's getting into...

36:49.498 --> 36:50.750
and so should you.

36:50.833 --> 36:52.293
Just stay away from Tom,
all right?

36:52.376 --> 36:53.252
He's not available.

36:53.336 --> 36:55.838
Hmm. You might want
to mention that to him.

36:55.922 --> 36:57.548
He seems to have other ideas.

37:14.732 --> 37:16.776
(horn blows)

37:16.859 --> 37:17.818
(audience cheering)

37:17.902 --> 37:19.654
Hey!

37:19.737 --> 37:21.155
{\an5}That was
a hell of a shot.
Thanks.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.616
{\an4}You know, Brandon,
you should really try
and keep it clean.

37:23.699 --> 37:25.451
{\an3}You know, that's funny
coming from you.

37:25.534 --> 37:26.577
Well, I've changed.
Oh, really?

37:26.661 --> 37:28.746
No, seriously, I have.
(chuckles)

37:33.459 --> 37:34.752
{\an3}Look, I've just got
to write a check

37:34.835 --> 37:37.046
{\an6}for the liquor delivery
and then we can hit the
road, all right?

37:37.129 --> 37:39.882
I want to get you out of town
for a little while.

37:39.966 --> 37:41.842
Mm, no problem.

37:41.926 --> 37:44.720
Who is this?
(woman singing)

37:44.804 --> 37:47.682
{\an6}That's Chloe.
That background singer
I was telling you about.

37:47.765 --> 37:49.809
I wanted you to
hear her stuff.

37:49.892 --> 37:53.437
Hmm, she's good.

37:53.521 --> 37:55.022
{\an3}Yeah.

37:55.106 --> 37:58.526
I'm gonna take care
of you, okay?

37:58.609 --> 38:00.611
Okay.

38:06.826 --> 38:07.827
(phone rings)

38:07.910 --> 38:09.912
Oh, uh, you go on.
I'll get it.

38:13.416 --> 38:14.875
After Dark. Hello?

38:14.959 --> 38:18.546
Yes, they're playing here
tonight at 10:00. Mm-hmm.

38:18.629 --> 38:20.756
Yeah, you might want to reserve
to be safe though.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.258
Okay, hang on.

38:22.341 --> 38:27.221
{\an3}Okay, Carla,
party of four.

38:27.304 --> 38:30.266
No problem. Okay, bye.

38:32.101 --> 38:34.311
This is where
we first met, remember?

38:34.395 --> 38:36.647
David?

38:36.731 --> 38:38.733
{\an3}David?!

38:38.816 --> 38:41.944
You know, it's funny
how wrong things went.

38:42.028 --> 38:43.904
Not funny "ha-ha."

38:43.988 --> 38:46.907
Just wrong, I guess.

38:46.991 --> 38:49.869
No, what you did was wrong.

38:49.952 --> 38:51.912
What you're doing now,
it's wrong.

38:51.996 --> 38:53.956
(footsteps)

38:55.332 --> 38:57.460
Did you have fun talking
to the cops last night?

38:57.543 --> 38:59.378
How does it feel to have them
breathing down <i> your</i> neck?

38:59.462 --> 39:00.379
David, don't!

39:01.922 --> 39:04.300
You know I tried
to make it up to you.

39:04.383 --> 39:06.052
{\an1}As thanks, I got cops
trailing me,

39:06.135 --> 39:12.391
banging on my door last night,
rifling through my stuff.

39:12.475 --> 39:14.226
{\an3}They never should have
let you out of jail.

39:14.310 --> 39:16.812
Two years isn't long enough for
what you tried to do to her.

39:16.896 --> 39:20.483
Too bad I didn't finish
what I started.

39:21.525 --> 39:23.319
She would have loved it.

39:23.402 --> 39:24.695
Get out!

39:24.779 --> 39:26.405
You want me out of your life?

39:26.489 --> 39:28.574
You want your damn
restraining order?

39:28.657 --> 39:30.367
Fine.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.245
God!

39:38.334 --> 39:39.418
Nice shot.

39:41.045 --> 39:43.172
Now your ass is mine.

40:03.192 --> 40:04.860
Congratulations, you won.

40:04.944 --> 40:06.195
Thanks, man.

40:06.278 --> 40:07.947
{\an3}Listen, sorry
about the elbow.

40:08.030 --> 40:09.490
It kinda gets away
from me sometimes.

40:09.573 --> 40:10.407
It doesn't matter.

40:10.491 --> 40:12.493
I shouldn't have gone
after you like that.

40:12.576 --> 40:14.495
It's all part
of the game.

40:14.578 --> 40:17.164
{\an1}Still, it's not the way
I like to play it.

40:17.248 --> 40:18.415
You sure about that?

40:18.499 --> 40:20.126
{\an3}Listen, if you have
a problem

40:20.209 --> 40:21.961
with me seeing Kelly,

40:22.044 --> 40:23.003
{\an3}say the word
and I'll stop.

40:23.087 --> 40:27.466
What's going on between you guys
is your business.

40:27.550 --> 40:31.137
Okay, I'll see you later.

40:31.220 --> 40:32.346
Yeah, take it easy, man.

40:39.770 --> 40:40.813
Hi.

40:40.896 --> 40:42.189
Is the coast clear?

40:42.273 --> 40:43.649
Yeah, it's just me.
Come on in.

40:49.613 --> 40:52.366
{\an1}So, what happened
out there?

40:52.449 --> 40:54.827
Nothing.

40:56.620 --> 40:58.164
{\an1}Is it Tom?

40:58.247 --> 41:01.000
Or is it Tom and Kelly?

41:02.460 --> 41:06.213
What's going on between Tom and
Kelly is between Tom and Kelly.

41:06.297 --> 41:07.715
(sighs)

41:07.798 --> 41:09.758
I don't know what it is
about that guy, though.

41:09.842 --> 41:11.051
He rubs me the wrong way.

41:13.137 --> 41:14.680
{\an3}Maybe you envy him.
No.

41:14.763 --> 41:18.934
No, I don't think so.

41:19.018 --> 41:21.604
{\an3}I'll tell you what,
though, I am...

41:21.687 --> 41:26.066
{\an3}sick and tired of...
being careful

41:26.150 --> 41:28.194
{\an3}and thinking
things through

41:28.277 --> 41:31.280
and trying to make sure
that nobody gets hurt.

41:31.363 --> 41:33.073
{\an1}Is that what you're doing
with us,

41:33.157 --> 41:35.034
holding back
so nobody gets hurt?

41:35.117 --> 41:37.286
It's not what I want to do.

41:37.369 --> 41:39.038
What do you want?

41:39.121 --> 41:42.082
(sighs)
I don't know.

41:43.167 --> 41:45.669
Those are three words.

41:48.631 --> 41:50.507
You want three more?

42:11.362 --> 42:12.613
I warned you, Mr. Slan,

42:12.696 --> 42:13.989
and you ignored me.

42:14.073 --> 42:15.908
The permanent restraining order
is granted.

42:15.991 --> 42:19.787
{\an3}Mr. Slan, you are to maintain
100-yards distance

42:19.870 --> 42:21.455
between yourself
and Ms. Martin.

42:21.538 --> 42:23.958
You're not to contact her or
have any communication with her

42:24.041 --> 42:27.253
{\an3}for a period of time
no less than three years.

42:27.336 --> 42:29.129
{\an3}At which point,
Ms. Martin,

42:29.213 --> 42:30.297

MALE VOICE (garbled):
Donna...

43:05.541 --> 43:08.377
I'm sorry I haven't called
in a while,

43:08.460 --> 43:11.672
but I did send you a present.

43:11.755 --> 43:15.009
Donna,
you're there, aren't you?

43:15.092 --> 43:18.762
I hate it when
you don't take my calls.

43:18.846 --> 43:24.852
It makes me very angry.

43:24.935 --> 43:26.729
I want you, Donna.

43:26.812 --> 43:29.023
I need you.

43:29.106 --> 43:31.525
And I'm going to have you.
