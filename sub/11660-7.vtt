00:44.100 --> 00:45.600
Good lord!

00:51.033 --> 00:53.233
Ma, what is going on here?

00:53.934 --> 00:55.066
Afterglow.

01:00.033 --> 01:03.100
This is the most upsetting thing
you've ever done.

01:03.166 --> 01:06.567
I am shocked. I am disappointed.
I am speechless!

01:06.633 --> 01:07.667
We're getting married.

01:07.734 --> 01:11.333
I pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

01:17.767 --> 01:23.667
(calm music playing)

01:46.834 --> 01:53.533
(fire alarm ringing)

01:54.233 --> 01:56.166
-Call 911.
-911.

01:56.233 --> 01:59.834
-Call 911.
-I got it.

01:59.900 --> 02:01.734
-Hello, get me the fire department, quick.
-Blanche.

02:01.800 --> 02:04.133
Wait, wait. Hello, fire department?

02:04.200 --> 02:07.533
This is Blanche Devereaux
at 5161 Richmond...

02:08.433 --> 02:11.433
oh, well of course you know where it is.
Hi, Ed.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.600
I'm on fire.

02:15.667 --> 02:17.700
Why, you naughty boy.

02:19.300 --> 02:20.400
Blanche.

02:20.467 --> 02:25.367
I'll bet that's why Chicago burned down.
Mrs. O'leary was probably a tramp too.

02:27.567 --> 02:28.867
Give me that.

02:29.133 --> 02:31.000
Look, I'm terribly sorry.

02:31.066 --> 02:33.433
There's been a mistake.
There is no fire here.

02:34.500 --> 02:36.133
That's right, this isn't Blanche

02:36.200 --> 02:39.934
so that remark about the fire
hose was totally wasted.

02:42.934 --> 02:45.166
I set off the smoke alarm.

02:45.233 --> 02:47.133
-How?
-Cigarette.

02:47.600 --> 02:51.967
Oh, no thank you, I don't smoke.
Now how did you set of the alarm?

02:52.033 --> 02:54.567
I smoked a cigarette, you ameba.

02:55.834 --> 02:57.333
I'm sorry, Rose.

02:57.400 --> 03:00.300
I'm just so upset that I started smoking
again.

03:00.367 --> 03:03.100
-Well, why did you start again?
-I don't know.

03:03.166 --> 03:06.233
I don't know, I've just been under a lot
of stress lately.

03:06.300 --> 03:09.800
-My job, Ma getting married--
-You're growing older,

03:09.867 --> 03:12.700
you don't go out much,
your chin is starting droop.

03:15.433 --> 03:17.367
You know, since I've already
had the cigarette

03:17.433 --> 03:19.967
why don't you just
blindfold me and shoot me!

03:21.367 --> 03:24.000
(Sophia) Hello, the honeymoon is over,
we're back!

03:24.066 --> 03:26.834
Don't let ma know I have been smoking.
She will kill me.

03:27.934 --> 03:31.367
-Ma!
-Dorothy!

03:34.467 --> 03:36.600
-What was that for?
-You've been smoking.

03:36.667 --> 03:37.800
I have not.

03:38.633 --> 03:41.333
-Then you've been smoking.
-No, I haven't.

03:41.400 --> 03:43.133
Ma, it was me.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.000
That's for lying.

03:46.066 --> 03:49.033
You quit 15 years ago
and said never again.

03:49.100 --> 03:51.467
I know, Ma. I'm sorry.

03:52.700 --> 03:55.400
You know, I quit once. I can quit again.

03:55.467 --> 03:59.300
Hi, everybody! It's me,
Max the blushing groom.

03:59.367 --> 04:01.100
Well, how was the honeymoon?

04:01.166 --> 04:03.934
That Disney world hotel
was wonderful.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.367
It had everything, good service,
delicious food, a beautiful room.

04:08.433 --> 04:11.867
-How were the rides?
-They got rides?

04:14.166 --> 04:17.433
Don't worry. You enjoyed yourself
and never stood in line.

04:17.867 --> 04:21.066
We'd like to chat, but we want to get
settled in our new place.

04:21.333 --> 04:22.333
-Bye-bye.
-Goodbye.

04:22.400 --> 04:25.700
Bye-bye. Come back soon.

04:27.867 --> 04:30.767
-We forgot something.
-We forgot to get a new place.

04:33.433 --> 04:34.467
You're kidding.

04:34.533 --> 04:38.333
We need a roof over our heads
while we look.

04:39.934 --> 04:41.834
Doesn't have to be fancy.

04:43.400 --> 04:44.400
Girls?

04:45.133 --> 04:47.000
Would you like to stay here with us?

04:47.066 --> 04:50.200
Here? Gee, that didn't even cross my mind.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.800
-What do you think, Max?
-Well, there's no pool.

04:53.867 --> 04:57.834
All right. But only for a couple days.
Get the bags, pumpkin.

04:58.700 --> 04:59.900
(door closes)

04:59.967 --> 05:01.900
He likes to eat breakfast
in his underwear.

05:01.967 --> 05:03.600
Hope that's no problem for anyone.

05:05.600 --> 05:08.300
-I need a cigarette.
-No, Dorothy, you don't.

05:08.367 --> 05:09.767
Sit right down here.

05:09.834 --> 05:12.200
You need to exercise
a little self-control.

05:12.266 --> 05:18.166
Listen. You can quit smoking.
Do it the way I did. Taper off.

05:18.233 --> 05:20.100
Smoke only after sex.

05:20.166 --> 05:23.133
Good idea.
One pack will last her a lifetime.

05:24.066 --> 05:29.867
(mellow music playing)

05:29.934 --> 05:35.133
(Dorothy humming)

05:36.867 --> 05:39.700
-Dorothy?
-Out in a minute, Ma.

06:05.700 --> 06:09.066
Hiya, cupcake.
It's time to play connect the freckles.

06:12.200 --> 06:16.333
Not now, Max.
Would you hand me the-- aah!

06:18.500 --> 06:20.333
What the hell's going on here?

06:21.300 --> 06:22.767
Aah! Aah!

06:22.834 --> 06:25.500
-Aah!
-Aah!

06:25.567 --> 06:27.500
Quiet, quiet!

06:27.800 --> 06:30.900
This is a big mistake.
I thought she was Sophia.

06:30.967 --> 06:34.133
Hand me my glasses.
I'm blind as a bat without them.

06:36.967 --> 06:39.400
Aah!

06:39.934 --> 06:42.967
Shut up, Max.
Blanche, hand me my robe.

06:43.233 --> 06:44.266
Here.

06:44.867 --> 06:45.934
Now, listen.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.867
We love you two,
but it's been three weeks,

06:48.934 --> 06:51.000
and this isn't working out.

06:51.066 --> 06:54.433
We forgot how hard it is
living with men.

06:54.500 --> 06:55.834
What did I do?

06:55.900 --> 07:01.300
You snore, and you hardly ever remember
to lift up the toilet seat.

07:01.367 --> 07:04.900
Please, he hardly ever remembers
to lift up the toilet lid!

07:08.600 --> 07:12.000
Fine. Fine.
We'll look for a place today. Come on.

07:20.300 --> 07:25.500
(mellow music playing)

07:31.266 --> 07:35.066
-Did you like the apartment?
-Too many old people.

07:35.133 --> 07:37.800
All those hearing aids interfere
with the TV.

07:40.166 --> 07:43.133
-You want a lifesaver?
-What kind?

07:43.200 --> 07:45.000
-Peppermint.
-I don't like peppermint.

07:45.066 --> 07:47.133
You got any butterscotch?

07:47.200 --> 07:49.834
Does it say 7-11
across my forehead?

07:51.500 --> 07:52.633
I got peppermint.

07:53.100 --> 07:54.300
I'll try one.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.200
I like butterscotch better.

07:59.166 --> 08:00.367
What is this, coconut?

08:01.166 --> 08:02.633
Peppermint!

08:04.800 --> 08:06.834
Don't yell. I heard you.

08:09.500 --> 08:13.633
-It's nice at the beach.
-Yeah. Beach is nice. Always was.

08:13.700 --> 08:16.300
-My Sal liked the beach.
-I know.

08:16.367 --> 08:21.100
That's why he wanted to open
our pizza-knish stand at Coney island.

08:21.166 --> 08:26.767
-Now, there was a million dollar idea.
-A million was a bargain for that idea.

08:26.834 --> 08:30.200
That was Sal's dream.
Too bad it didn't work.

08:30.266 --> 08:31.533
Yeah. Bad timing.

08:32.934 --> 08:38.033
(saxophone plays)

08:38.100 --> 08:41.000
Hey! Hey, hey. Hey.

08:41.567 --> 08:43.900
You're driving away the birds
with that noise.

08:44.433 --> 08:47.300
-You know a real song?
-Do you have a buck?

08:49.266 --> 08:50.633
"It Had To Be You."

08:51.433 --> 08:53.667
That was Sal's favorite song.

08:54.633 --> 08:57.800
♪ <i>It had to be you</i> ♪

08:58.133 --> 09:01.000
♪ <i>It had to be you</i> ♪

09:01.633 --> 09:03.600
♪ <i>I wandered around</i> ♪

09:03.667 --> 09:05.300
♪ <i>And finally found</i> ♪

09:05.367 --> 09:08.166
Speaking of found, look what I found.

09:08.800 --> 09:09.900
Butterscotch.

09:09.967 --> 09:13.800
(saxophone playing)

09:13.867 --> 09:15.900
Doesn't get much better than this.

09:16.433 --> 09:22.800
(saxophone continues playing)

09:25.433 --> 09:30.333
(calm music playing)

09:31.867 --> 09:33.867
Oh, it is such a beautiful day.

09:33.934 --> 09:36.433
What do you want to do?

09:36.500 --> 09:40.567
Sit in a dark room
smoking 10 packs of cigarettes.

09:41.433 --> 09:44.900
I know what you're experiencing.
I smoked for years.

09:44.967 --> 09:46.300
You smoked?

09:46.367 --> 09:49.734
Rose, that's like finding out
Lassie was an alcoholic.

09:51.934 --> 09:53.900
Lassie was an alcoholic?

09:56.100 --> 09:58.800
That explains why
she always tipped to one side

09:58.867 --> 10:00.600
when she waved goodbye to Timmy.

10:06.300 --> 10:09.900
Hi, everybody.
We've got some great news.

10:09.967 --> 10:13.266
We found a place.
It's absolutely perfect,

10:13.333 --> 10:17.266
near the beach, reasonably priced,
and just the right size.

10:17.333 --> 10:20.967
-That's great.
-We can't wait to show you.

10:26.533 --> 10:28.367
Well, what do you think?

10:32.633 --> 10:36.133
Ma, this is a rundown old concession
stand!

10:36.200 --> 10:39.734
-You can't live here.
-We're not. We leased it.

10:39.800 --> 10:43.266
It took every dime,
but our dream's come true.

10:43.333 --> 10:44.934
I don't understand.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.066
You should have that printed on a t-shirt.

10:50.367 --> 10:52.000
We're reopening the business.

10:52.066 --> 10:54.567
A million dollar idea deserves
a second chance.

10:54.633 --> 10:59.266
You're both over 80.
Starting a business is hard work.

10:59.333 --> 11:02.333
For amateurs, but we've
already done this before.

11:02.834 --> 11:06.033
We'll be staying with you
until the business gets off the ground.

11:08.533 --> 11:10.633
What happens if the business fails?

11:10.700 --> 11:13.500
We'll have to talk
about a night light for the bathroom.

11:14.033 --> 11:18.233
(mellow music playing)

11:24.467 --> 11:27.133
Max, put the paint brush down a minute.

11:28.066 --> 11:29.333
Taste this pizza.

11:30.834 --> 11:33.200
I want an absolutely honest opinion.

11:33.633 --> 11:35.266
-I'm dying.
-Yeah?

11:35.333 --> 11:36.700
-It's gorgeous.
-Yeah?

11:36.767 --> 11:39.233
Perfection, like velvet in my mouth.

11:39.633 --> 11:44.500
A masterpiece, a Picasso in mozzarella.
A Rembrandt with tomato sauce.

11:44.567 --> 11:48.066
-It needs more salt.
-And garlic. It's a little flat.

11:51.367 --> 11:56.600
-Wow, look at this.
-The place is really coming along.

11:56.667 --> 12:00.300
-Boy, I'll say it is.
-I have to give you two credit.

12:00.367 --> 12:03.467
-It's really going to happen.
-Why shouldn't it happen?

12:03.934 --> 12:06.667
I know pizza like the back of my hand.

12:07.066 --> 12:10.734
I never noticed that.
What would it cost to remove it?

12:11.834 --> 12:13.166
Let's talk at home.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.266
-It's getting late. Let's go.
-We have more work here.

12:16.333 --> 12:19.667
-You're overdoing it.
-We're fine.

12:19.734 --> 12:23.934
We want our grand opening
at this weekend's beach festival.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.266
It's getting damp and chilly.
You'll catch yourself a cold.

12:28.333 --> 12:31.066
I haven't had a cold in 40 years.

12:31.467 --> 12:34.367
This is my worst cold in 40 years.

12:35.333 --> 12:39.133
My back is killing me.
I feel dizzy and nauseous.

12:39.433 --> 12:44.166
-Every joint feels like it's on fire.
-You really caught a nasty bug.

12:44.233 --> 12:47.433
I'm 84. I feel like this every day.

12:48.967 --> 12:51.500
Never fear. Dr. Rose is here.

12:51.834 --> 12:55.133
I made old-fashioned St. Olaf tonic...

12:55.433 --> 12:58.900
guaranteed to get you back on your feet
and put hair on your chest.

12:59.533 --> 13:02.433
That's the one nasty side-effect
they could never figure out.

13:04.533 --> 13:05.533
(coughs)

13:06.166 --> 13:09.066
I'm feeling better.
I'll go check the stand.

13:09.133 --> 13:11.333
The festival is this weekend.

13:11.600 --> 13:15.233
If we don't make some money,
we'll lose our lease.

13:15.300 --> 13:19.834
-It's out of the question.
-She's right. We're too sick.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.133
The dream is ended. It's over.

13:22.734 --> 13:24.000
It's a dirty rotten shame

13:24.066 --> 13:26.667
we couldn't find somebody
who could find it in their heart

13:26.734 --> 13:30.066
to help this absolutely
adorable old couple...

13:30.500 --> 13:33.400
fulfill their dream of a lifetime.

13:40.367 --> 13:43.700
Oh, all right. All right. We will.

13:43.767 --> 13:44.900
-You?
-You?

13:45.967 --> 13:48.100
-Do you have any experience?
-(all) No.

13:48.166 --> 13:49.400
-You're hired.
-You're hired.

13:56.867 --> 14:00.934
Boy, making pizza really brings back
childhood memories.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.200
You made pizza as a kid?

14:03.266 --> 14:08.500
No. My favorite uncle, uncle Günter,
sprinkled parmesan cheese on his hair.

14:12.533 --> 14:13.800
Why would he do that?

14:14.266 --> 14:18.300
He said it was the perfect complement
to the croutons he taped to his eyebrows.

14:20.033 --> 14:21.633
He had a Caesar complex.

14:22.066 --> 14:23.467
Salad, not Julius.

14:25.467 --> 14:28.100
Maybe you ought to work on the knishes,

14:28.166 --> 14:31.133
or did you have an uncle
who was a Mr. Potato head?

14:33.033 --> 14:36.900
You're just cranky
because you haven't had a cigarette.

14:36.967 --> 14:40.734
Maybe, but I think
I'm over the worst part.

14:40.800 --> 14:43.867
That's great. I'm really proud of you.

14:44.467 --> 14:48.100
You'd think you'd miss that feeling you
get with that first puff,

14:48.166 --> 14:51.900
that feeling of relaxation
when you hold it in,

14:51.967 --> 14:55.433
and then the sheer exhilaration
as you exhale slowly.

14:56.934 --> 15:01.033
No, not really.
I've found other ways to ease my tensions.

15:01.100 --> 15:03.500
Honey, would you hand me that large pan?

15:03.567 --> 15:06.734
-Oh, sure.
-No, the really big one.

15:26.433 --> 15:29.800
You really have to give Max
and Sophia credit.

15:29.867 --> 15:34.734
This was their dream. They're going after
it. I wish I'd done that.

15:34.800 --> 15:37.734
Fine. Honey, would you
check on the pizzas?

15:37.800 --> 15:39.867
Why don't you want
to hear about my dream?

15:39.934 --> 15:43.467
It's always the same thing with you,
Blanche,

15:43.533 --> 15:47.166
sex, sex, sex. I'm tired of hearing it.

15:47.233 --> 15:49.834
Maybe that's because you're not getting
any, Dorothy.

15:52.734 --> 15:54.333
Do you want the pot again?

15:59.400 --> 16:02.867
Well, it just so happens
it was not about sex.

16:03.166 --> 16:05.600
There's lots more than that
to Blanche Devereaux.

16:05.667 --> 16:11.033
My dream was to be a great scientist,
work in a laboratory, do research,

16:11.100 --> 16:15.800
-find a cure for the common cold.
-I owe you an apology.

16:15.867 --> 16:18.734
I'd knock those test tubes off the table,

16:18.800 --> 16:22.100
grab a PhD., and show those lab rabbits
how it's really done.

16:27.633 --> 16:29.400
It's going to be a long afternoon.

16:31.066 --> 16:35.734
(serene music playing)

16:36.934 --> 16:38.934
This is so depressing.

16:39.633 --> 16:44.266
-We haven't had a customer in two hours.
-That's because we need promotion.

16:45.767 --> 16:47.600
You know, Blanche is right.

16:48.500 --> 16:52.667
It doesn't matter how good your product
is. You have to promote it.

16:52.734 --> 16:55.533
That sure was the case
with Fritz Fenderhooven,

16:55.600 --> 16:57.934
who owned St. Olaf
motor coach company.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.533
They built a car?

16:59.600 --> 17:02.900
They sure did.
The Fenderhooven rocket.

17:03.200 --> 17:04.600
Oh, it was a beauty.

17:05.300 --> 17:07.000
Fritz really had vision.

17:07.667 --> 17:10.667
Actually, he had double vision,
which is why it had eight tires.

17:14.800 --> 17:19.100
-So, uh... what happened?
-It never got off the ground.

17:19.166 --> 17:21.767
Bad promotion. A shame.

17:21.834 --> 17:25.667
It's the first car to this day
that ran on free fuel.

17:25.734 --> 17:28.266
It was totally powered by cow manure.

17:30.467 --> 17:33.600
I think a lot of people
were turned off by the ad...

17:33.934 --> 17:37.567
a cow sitting on a gas tank
reading the<i> Farmer's Almanac.</i>

17:42.700 --> 17:45.800
-How's it going?
-What are you doing here?

17:45.867 --> 17:49.133
I wanted some fresh air. How's business?

17:49.200 --> 17:54.500
-We've only had two customers all day.
-It's hot. Everyone's in the water.

17:54.567 --> 17:58.633
You can't get them out of the water?
Amateurs.

17:58.700 --> 18:02.233
I'll show you how you run
a pizza-knish stand at the beach.

18:08.667 --> 18:12.433
-Shark! Shark! Shark!
-Aah!

18:12.500 --> 18:14.900
They're out of the water. Start selling!

18:14.967 --> 18:17.100
-Pizza!
-Step right up.

18:17.900 --> 18:23.867
(serene music playing)

18:23.934 --> 18:28.200
After that,
people started trying our food.

18:28.266 --> 18:32.934
-Soon there wasn't a pizza or knish left.
-It's a hit.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.033
Sophia, I'm very proud of you.

18:36.100 --> 18:40.467
Not only did you save the business,
you saved everyone from the shark.

18:44.333 --> 18:46.533
Don't look so worried.
I handle the books.

18:47.567 --> 18:50.133
(telephone rings)

18:51.266 --> 18:55.500
Hello. What?
Oh, no. We'll be right there.

18:55.567 --> 18:56.734
What's wrong?

18:59.533 --> 19:01.233
I don't understand it.

19:02.533 --> 19:05.633
-How could the stand have burned?
-I don't know.

19:05.700 --> 19:07.266
We were so careful.

19:07.867 --> 19:09.533
I have a confession to make.

19:10.367 --> 19:16.200
I sent you ahead and said I'd lock up...
because I wanted a cigarette.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.600
-I guess I didn't put it out.
-Ohh.

19:19.900 --> 19:22.800
Well, I wouldn't worry.
How much harm can it do?

19:22.867 --> 19:24.734
The place already burned down.

19:31.133 --> 19:35.667
Rose, you dummy, she means
her cigarette started the fire.

19:35.734 --> 19:41.333
Max, Ma, I've never felt so bad.
I don't know what to say.

19:42.233 --> 19:45.367
It was an accident, pussycat.
Don't worry about it.

19:45.433 --> 19:49.166
-That's it? That's all you have to say?
-Uh-huh.

19:49.233 --> 19:51.500
Please yell at me.

19:51.567 --> 19:54.400
Please scream at me. Make me feel guilty.

19:54.467 --> 19:57.600
If you don't say anything,
I'll feel twice as bad.

19:57.667 --> 19:59.800
I know. I'm not an amateur at this.

20:01.467 --> 20:05.400
-We finally found the fire's cause.
-Take me away. Cuff me.

20:06.967 --> 20:09.033
I'd like to take you to dinner first.

20:10.033 --> 20:14.200
Then we can play the rest by ear,
but business before pleasure.

20:15.166 --> 20:18.567
Your fire was caused
by a faulty coil in the pizza oven.

20:18.633 --> 20:21.133
I'll write a report
for your insurance company.

20:21.200 --> 20:24.934
This is wonderful news.
Dorothy, it wasn't your fault.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.233
With the insurance money,
they can build again,

20:28.300 --> 20:30.133
bigger and better than ever.

20:30.200 --> 20:35.233
From these ashes, a phoenix will rise,
stronger, healthier, more vibrant,

20:35.300 --> 20:37.500
more successful than before.

20:38.033 --> 20:39.300
-Eh!
-Eh!

20:43.633 --> 20:45.300
Why did you say "eh"?

20:46.166 --> 20:47.333
It just came out.

20:47.967 --> 20:49.033
Me too.

20:50.133 --> 20:52.400
Did you have fun
rebuilding the old business?

20:52.467 --> 20:55.834
Eh! It always felt like
something was missing.

20:56.734 --> 20:58.467
I can tell you what that was.

20:59.100 --> 21:00.266
My Salvadore.

21:01.133 --> 21:02.266
And my Esther.

21:04.800 --> 21:08.000
Sophia... I think we got a problem here.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.867
Is there anything we can do, Sophia?

21:11.166 --> 21:13.433
Get two cheesecakes and wait up for me.

21:13.500 --> 21:16.133
The four of us
will be talking till dawn.

21:22.233 --> 21:27.166
-Max, do you love me?
-Sure. You?

21:27.533 --> 21:28.667
I love you.

21:29.967 --> 21:31.700
Are you in love with me?

21:32.734 --> 21:35.066
What is this,
<i>The Oprah Winfrey Show?</i>

21:36.033 --> 21:37.500
You know what I mean.

21:38.500 --> 21:41.567
Are you in love with me
like you were with Esther?

21:41.633 --> 21:44.900
No. Do you love me like Sal?

21:45.500 --> 21:46.600
I thought I did.

21:46.667 --> 21:50.700
I confused a great friendship
with a great love.

21:50.767 --> 21:53.300
If this was Ronald Coleman
and Greer Garson,

21:53.367 --> 21:56.166
there wouldn't be a dry eye in the house.

21:57.066 --> 22:00.300
This kind of mistake you make at 19.

22:00.367 --> 22:03.333
It's hopeful to think you can be dopey
at 82.

22:05.033 --> 22:07.467
So, do you want to get a divorce?

22:07.867 --> 22:09.467
Hey, I'm Catholic.

22:09.867 --> 22:12.867
I don't need a divorce on my record
with St. Peter in spitting distance.

22:15.900 --> 22:21.266
-I say we get separated.
-Fine. That's a better idea.

22:22.100 --> 22:23.500
I'll go back to Brooklyn.

22:23.934 --> 22:26.100
My family's there, my grandkids...

22:27.200 --> 22:29.100
and I miss the old neighborhood.

22:29.600 --> 22:34.867
I'll stay here. Since I lost my Sal,
the ladies I live with are my family.

22:35.266 --> 22:40.133
But that doesn't mean we can't get
together occasionally for... you know.

22:43.633 --> 22:45.667
You can do that
when you're just good friends?

22:45.734 --> 22:48.734
I want points with St. Peter, not his job.

22:51.300 --> 22:54.734
You know, me and Esther
and you and Salvadore...

22:56.033 --> 22:57.867
we were all good together.

22:58.533 --> 22:59.667
The best.

23:02.900 --> 23:03.900
Hey, mister.

23:04.467 --> 23:07.400
Want me to play for the two of you?

23:07.467 --> 23:09.967
I want you to play for the four of us.

23:11.233 --> 23:18.233
(playing "It Had to Be You")

23:34.233 --> 23:39.967
(theme music playing)
