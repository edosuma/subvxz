01:40.479 --> 01:42.857
Hey, Lucky,
got a cigarette?

01:42.949 --> 01:45.862
No, Mooch,
I don't have any cigarettes.

01:45.952 --> 01:48.296
Why don't you ask me
for a breath mint sometime?

01:48.387 --> 01:50.459
What's that supposed to mean?
Hey!

01:52.659 --> 01:53.997
Hey, Sticks,
give me a cigarette.

01:55.829 --> 01:58.002
Cool.
Could I have one for later?

01:59.733 --> 02:01.713
All right, cool.
Can I have a match?

02:01.802 --> 02:05.147
Mooch, leave me alone.
Get yourself adopted or something.

02:05.239 --> 02:06.149
<i>Shit.</i>

02:06.240 --> 02:08.312
Delores, give me a couple
of eggs over easy.

02:09.610 --> 02:11.591
Thank you baby.
Yeah.

02:11.679 --> 02:12.783
Who's hungry?

02:14.349 --> 02:15.293
<i>Martinez...</i>

02:15.683 --> 02:18.994
Whoa, Martinez,
baby, baby!

02:19.087 --> 02:21.158
- Wake up.
- Yes, sir.

02:21.256 --> 02:24.965
Drop one of them, you'll
end up looking like Swiss cheese.

02:25.059 --> 02:26.862
Give me a break.
You never dropped anything?

02:29.965 --> 02:31.239
<i>Atten... hut!</i>

02:33.969 --> 02:36.950
All right.
Listen up.

02:37.039 --> 02:39.679
We are orbiting the planet
of Ithacon.

02:39.775 --> 02:42.278
In a few minutes,
we will board the shuttlecraft

02:42.378 --> 02:44.791
and proceed to
target area Delta.

02:44.881 --> 02:49.352
Our mission is search
and destroy.

02:49.452 --> 02:53.730
I repeat,
search and destroy.

02:53.823 --> 02:56.531
We've been chasing this alien
son of a bitch long enough.

02:56.626 --> 02:58.628
In the past six months,
he has disrupted

02:58.728 --> 03:03.405
the galactic mining operation to
the tune of a half billion dollars.

03:03.501 --> 03:06.038
Word's come down from above.

03:06.137 --> 03:08.777
Kill the bastard!

03:08.873 --> 03:11.615
Now, what is our motto?

03:11.709 --> 03:14.417
Semper fi. Do or die.
Kill, kill, kill.

03:14.512 --> 03:15.855
I can't hear you!

03:15.947 --> 03:18.587
Semper fi. Do or die.
Kill, kill, kill.

03:18.683 --> 03:20.755
Good, good!

03:20.852 --> 03:22.627
What the hell are you
doing here, lady?

03:22.721 --> 03:24.928
You're in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

03:25.023 --> 03:26.798
This is for
authorized personnel only.

03:28.327 --> 03:30.398
I'm looking for
Sergeant Hooker.

03:30.495 --> 03:32.941
You found him. I'm busy.
What the fuck do you want'?

03:33.031 --> 03:37.173
- I'm Dr. Reeves.
- Great! Dr. Reeves is here.

03:40.173 --> 03:43.177
- I've been assigned to your group.
- What the hell for'?

03:43.276 --> 03:47.156
I'm to collect samples
of any alien life forms

03:47.246 --> 03:49.089
and report them back
to Dr. Mittenhand.

03:49.182 --> 03:52.095
Bullshit!
Bullshit!

03:52.185 --> 03:53.858
- Sticks!
- Sir! Yes, sir!

03:53.953 --> 03:55.364
Give me Dr. Mittenhand , now!

03:55.455 --> 03:57.800
<i>- At ease!
- Computer...</i>

03:57.891 --> 04:00.531
Get your lazy butt online.
We need to speak to the boss.

04:00.627 --> 04:02.038
What is it'?

04:02.129 --> 04:04.439
Sergeant Hooker here, sir,
in the Armory.

04:04.531 --> 04:06.340
We got a female
of the species,

04:06.433 --> 04:09.414
says she's assigned to
our search and destroy mission.

04:09.503 --> 04:10.948
Correct.

04:11.038 --> 04:14.315
Dr. Reeves is the ship's
biological officer

04:14.408 --> 04:16.480
and my personal assistant.

04:16.577 --> 04:20.492
You will see to it that she
is protected at all times.

04:20.582 --> 04:23.085
With all due respect sir,
we can't be babysitting--

04:23.184 --> 04:25.721
You have your orders, Sergeant.

04:25.820 --> 04:29.495
I suggest you follow them.

04:34.730 --> 04:37.370
- Books!
- Sir! Yes, sir!

04:39.335 --> 04:41.941
Get this little girl...
ready for combat.

04:43.639 --> 04:45.812
From now on,
she's your responsibility.

04:46.909 --> 04:48.286
Sir! Yes, sir!

04:48.377 --> 04:50.254
Let's mount up!

05:07.731 --> 05:09.711
Is this really necessary?

05:09.800 --> 05:11.940
If you want to stay alive,
it is.

05:12.036 --> 05:13.447
Do you mind?

05:13.538 --> 05:16.246
Excuse me, excuse me.
Gentle, gentle.

05:16.340 --> 05:18.013
The problem my friend
is having,

05:18.109 --> 05:20.248
he's never had to put clothes
on a woman before.

05:20.344 --> 05:22.017
As you were, Sticks.

05:24.082 --> 05:25.959
Ughh! Having fun'?

05:28.921 --> 05:30.628
Damn! Who's driving?
Ray Charles?

05:30.722 --> 05:31.792
Sorry.

05:31.890 --> 05:33.198
You all right'?

05:34.326 --> 05:36.499
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.

05:38.730 --> 05:40.471
Uh, better strap yourself in.

06:06.293 --> 06:08.204
Good evening.

06:11.565 --> 06:14.705
An angel's voice sends pleasure
to every part of my being.

06:16.537 --> 06:20.246
Your shrieks, my dear,
provide a perfect accompaniment

06:20.341 --> 06:21.979
to this romantic evening.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.016
Dinner for two.

06:33.288 --> 06:36.758
Don't be afraid, me dear.
I'm love's own messenger

06:36.858 --> 06:39.270
sent to bring you
tidings of joy

06:39.361 --> 06:42.206
and the promise
of newborn ecstasy.

06:42.298 --> 06:43.743
Take a seat.

06:47.770 --> 06:50.478
A little of the bubbly to put us
on more friendly terms.

07:01.518 --> 07:03.555
Listen up.

07:03.654 --> 07:04.997
We're going in.

07:05.789 --> 07:07.564
Bow heads!

07:07.658 --> 07:12.334
Lord, be with us as we hunt down
this ungodly son of a bitch.

07:12.429 --> 07:16.400
And give us the strength to kill
anything in our path

07:16.500 --> 07:19.812
and may all our wounds
be flesh wounds only.

07:19.904 --> 07:20.814
Amen.

07:20.905 --> 07:21.815
Amen.

07:22.874 --> 07:24.854
I feel real safe now.
Don't you?

07:27.545 --> 07:29.525
Can I ask you something?

07:29.614 --> 07:31.525
What happened to
the sergeant's head?

07:33.051 --> 07:35.031
Happened in the last war.

07:35.119 --> 07:37.760
The sergeant went down
in a shuttle over Crilanium.

07:37.856 --> 07:39.563
Took out half his skull.

07:39.658 --> 07:41.331
He still managed to carry
a wounded Marine

07:41.427 --> 07:45.068
on his back 15 miles
before he reached our lines.

07:45.164 --> 07:47.269
<i>Wow...</i>

07:47.366 --> 07:50.210
Did he live?

07:50.302 --> 07:52.248
The guy he carried
on his back?

07:55.809 --> 07:58.415
Oh, yeah, he lived.

07:58.511 --> 07:59.888
If you call this living.
Ooh!

08:03.350 --> 08:05.557
To the most beautiful woman
in the universe,

08:05.652 --> 08:09.293
Princess Zarina,
my future wife.

08:09.389 --> 08:12.165
Your wife?
Your wife!

08:12.260 --> 08:15.639
How dare you?
Do you know who I am'?

08:15.730 --> 08:17.835
I am the daughter of a king.

08:17.932 --> 08:19.741
And you will one day
be a queen.

08:19.834 --> 08:24.180
And it is your royal blood, madame,
that will make me a king.

08:24.272 --> 08:27.014
What? You, a king?

08:29.043 --> 08:31.991
Laugh if you like, me darling,
but I'll have me way.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.855
I'm a man amongst men,

08:33.948 --> 08:36.986
and it's tired I am
of being treated like a dog.

08:37.085 --> 08:39.530
From now on, the rest
of this miserable universe

08:39.621 --> 08:41.828
will bow and scrape
before me.

08:41.923 --> 08:43.027
<i>And if they don't...</i>

08:44.793 --> 08:46.329
off with their heads!
Ha, ha, ha!

09:00.143 --> 09:01.918
A real vacation spot.

09:02.011 --> 09:04.548
I've seen worse.
Ever been to Detroit?

09:09.053 --> 09:11.761
Have you ever been
in combat before?

09:11.855 --> 09:13.994
Yeah, lots of times.

09:14.091 --> 09:16.367
Aren't you ever frightened?

09:16.460 --> 09:18.997
Are you kidding?
I'm scared now.

09:20.464 --> 09:23.308
So is everybody else.
It comes with the job.

09:26.671 --> 09:27.843
Hey...

09:27.939 --> 09:30.078
We fight better
when we're a bit goosed.

09:30.175 --> 09:31.654
Know what I mean?

09:31.743 --> 09:33.188
Yeah.
I think so.

09:34.713 --> 09:36.954
I'll never marry you!
Never!

09:37.048 --> 09:38.823
I'd rather die first.

09:38.917 --> 09:43.263
Would you rather be dead,
or would you rather be rich?

09:43.356 --> 09:44.391
Excuse me'?

09:44.490 --> 09:47.369
Your father, the king,
hasn't a penny to his name.

09:47.460 --> 09:49.064
He's a stupid old fool

09:49.161 --> 09:51.607
who gave everything he had
to his loyal subjects

09:51.697 --> 09:53.938
leaving his family with nothing.

09:54.033 --> 09:56.479
He was being noble.

09:56.569 --> 09:58.606
He was being a fool.

09:58.704 --> 10:01.618
I'll make you rich beyond
your wildest dreams.

10:03.343 --> 10:04.913
Oh, really?

10:05.011 --> 10:06.820
Yes, really.

10:11.785 --> 10:13.526
They're beautiful!

10:14.721 --> 10:17.827
There's plenty more
where that came from.

10:17.924 --> 10:20.667
You begin to interest me.
Vaguely.

10:25.967 --> 10:27.412
Lucky, you're up.

10:29.504 --> 10:31.711
I'm getting a reading.
Check it out.

10:40.215 --> 10:43.025
You were meant to be a queen,
and with me by your side

10:43.118 --> 10:46.031
you'll have the richest kingdom
in the universe.

10:46.121 --> 10:50.194
I'll cover you with jewels from
the far corners of the galaxy.

10:50.292 --> 10:51.737
I deserve it, you know?

10:52.928 --> 10:54.839
For all I've suffered.

10:54.930 --> 10:57.036
Being a princess
and having nothing to wear...

10:58.968 --> 11:01.539
People treating me as though
I were common...

11:14.885 --> 11:18.355
You'll have everything
you've ever wanted.

11:18.456 --> 11:22.370
Gold is power.
Gold is power.

11:23.594 --> 11:26.803
Power, power...

11:26.897 --> 11:28.570
Power.

11:42.047 --> 11:43.253
Aaahh!

11:44.182 --> 11:45.855
Visitors.

11:46.618 --> 11:48.620
My father!
He's found me.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.722
If he has,
will you go with him?

11:53.159 --> 11:55.605
The king is dead.
Long live the king.

11:56.696 --> 11:58.698
Oh,yes.

12:01.934 --> 12:03.936
- Nice work, Lucky.
- Sorry, Sarge.

12:04.036 --> 12:06.539
Now the whole planet
knows we're here.

12:06.639 --> 12:08.277
Check out that passageway.

12:08.374 --> 12:10.150
The rest of you,
stay alert!

13:09.706 --> 13:11.014
Aaaahh!

13:14.544 --> 13:16.387
Lucky! Go!
Move, move!

13:18.014 --> 13:20.153
No!
You stay with Cupcake.

13:20.250 --> 13:21.388
Cupcake'?

13:30.194 --> 13:31.537
Stay here and don't move!

13:47.980 --> 13:49.391
Sarge!

13:51.683 --> 13:53.094
I'm gonna
take this bastard out!

13:56.688 --> 13:57.860
Get down!

14:08.735 --> 14:09.941
Let's move out!

14:12.071 --> 14:13.106
Let's do it!
Let's do it!

14:14.040 --> 14:15.781
Go,go,go!

14:15.875 --> 14:17.947
- Nice toss, Kowalski.
- Grand slam.

14:19.346 --> 14:20.654
Good job, men.

14:23.083 --> 14:24.323
She's alive.

14:24.418 --> 14:27.399
We need some help. We need to
get her to the shuttle.

14:27.488 --> 14:28.792
Danny, get over here.

14:29.857 --> 14:31.996
I'm doing my best,
but this doesn't look good.

14:33.761 --> 14:35.298
Books,
give us a hand here.

14:37.298 --> 14:38.834
Here.

14:38.933 --> 14:40.310
- Shit, man
- What are you doing?

14:40.402 --> 14:43.144
I can reattach this.
Stop playing around.

14:47.842 --> 14:49.014
<i>Shit.</i>

14:50.879 --> 14:52.153
Kowalski, Sticks!

14:54.450 --> 14:56.123
Start packing this up.

14:56.218 --> 14:58.061
Wait a minute, Sarge.
It was my kill.

14:58.154 --> 14:59.997
I get to add the final touch.

15:01.290 --> 15:03.770
Pure Rocky Mountain
spring water.

15:04.894 --> 15:07.135
Death from above.

15:07.229 --> 15:08.674
Let it rain!

15:11.902 --> 15:14.314
Oh, shit!

15:14.404 --> 15:15.974
Way to go, KO.

15:16.073 --> 15:19.111
I'd give you a round of applause,
but I see you already got the clap.

15:19.209 --> 15:20.688
That's not funny.

15:29.553 --> 15:31.761
This is Eagle One
to base.

15:31.856 --> 15:34.735
Mission accomplished.
Target has been destroyed.

15:34.826 --> 15:37.830
We got one killed and we're
bringing back a casualty.

15:37.929 --> 15:42.002
Humanoid female.
Origin unknown.

15:42.100 --> 15:44.774
Estimated time of arrival--
12 minutes.

16:01.620 --> 16:04.464
- Harold...
- I'm busy.

16:04.556 --> 16:06.195
Harold, come look at this.

16:12.532 --> 16:13.840
What?

16:13.933 --> 16:17.278
- You know what this is?
- Educate me.

16:17.370 --> 16:19.680
It's from the planet Dominia.

16:19.773 --> 16:22.344
It signifies royal birth.

16:22.442 --> 16:23.944
This is quite
an opportunity.

16:25.012 --> 16:26.753
For what?

16:26.847 --> 16:29.828
If we can save her, it will mean
better relations with the Dominians.

16:31.218 --> 16:33.994
I want a complete work up
on her bodily fluids,

16:34.088 --> 16:38.195
organ delineation charts
and let's run an encephalogram.

16:38.292 --> 16:41.466
Run it through the main computer
so Dr. Mittenhand can look it over.

16:42.564 --> 16:43.702
Excuse me'?

16:45.167 --> 16:46.646
I don't work for you.

16:46.735 --> 16:49.978
Just do it. We'll fight about
who's in charge later.

16:50.071 --> 16:51.982
You heard the lady, Harold.
Move your ass.

16:52.073 --> 16:52.983
Hey...

16:53.074 --> 16:55.884
<i>don't touch me unless
you mean it...</i>

16:55.977 --> 16:57.718
<i>...cowboy.</i>

17:02.318 --> 17:04.491
Don't ever do that again.

17:04.587 --> 17:05.998
Do what?
I was trying to help.

17:06.088 --> 17:08.534
I understand, but that's not
the help I need.

17:11.861 --> 17:13.306
What was your name?

17:13.396 --> 17:15.433
Sergeant Malloy.
Friends call me "Books."

17:15.531 --> 17:18.478
Well, Sergeant Malloy,
I have a lot of work to do,

17:18.568 --> 17:22.016
so if you don't mind, why don't
you return to your little unit

17:22.105 --> 17:25.244
and do whatever you people do
when you're not killing something?

17:26.542 --> 17:27.920
Strip.

17:29.980 --> 17:31.357
I beg your pardon.

17:32.683 --> 17:34.526
I got to take your body armor.

17:40.992 --> 17:44.235
The entertainment lounge
is now open for refreshments.

17:44.329 --> 17:45.831
Please drink in moderation

17:45.930 --> 17:48.171
and have a wonderful evening.

17:48.266 --> 17:50.075
Wow!
High grade material.

17:50.168 --> 17:51.841
The cave is riddled
with gold.

17:51.936 --> 17:53.381
Hurry up, dickhead!

17:53.471 --> 17:56.316
Get this secured
so that I can go get drunk.

18:13.058 --> 18:16.973
Handy little gadget. What do you
do when you want to unload it'?

18:25.405 --> 18:26.975
Not bad.

18:27.073 --> 18:29.519
It was invented by
Dr. Mittenhand.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.247
He's a real genius.

18:31.344 --> 18:32.983
Yes, Harold.

18:33.080 --> 18:37.654
Thank you for that
heartfelt testimonial.

18:37.752 --> 18:41.529
I have informed
Galactic Enterprises of our find.

18:41.622 --> 18:44.000
Our instructions are
to orbit the planet

18:44.091 --> 18:47.629
until a mining crew and
the appropriate equipment arrive.

18:47.728 --> 18:49.730
Once the mining procedure
has begun

18:49.830 --> 18:51.572
we can return home.

18:51.667 --> 18:54.011
Sergeant, your men
will act as security

18:54.102 --> 18:56.207
until we are relieved.
Any questions?

18:56.305 --> 18:58.046
Yeah, I got a question.

18:58.140 --> 19:00.552
Our contracts expire
at midnight tonight.

19:00.642 --> 19:04.556
I am sure a bonus of some kind
can be arranged.

19:04.646 --> 19:06.284
We signed on for 30 days.

19:06.381 --> 19:09.829
Legally, we are free agents
as of midnight tonight.

19:09.919 --> 19:12.832
No one leaves this ship
unless I so say...

19:14.424 --> 19:16.131
<i>...say so.</i>

19:17.760 --> 19:19.967
Is that clear, Sergeant?

19:20.063 --> 19:21.542
Is that clear'?

19:23.266 --> 19:24.540
With all due respect, sir...

19:24.634 --> 19:27.582
Thank you for understanding.

19:27.671 --> 19:29.241
Carry on.

19:31.141 --> 19:33.747
I wouldn't argue with
Dr. Mittenhand.

19:33.844 --> 19:35.152
Ever.

19:54.299 --> 19:55.539
Let's go someplace..

19:55.633 --> 19:57.340
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:57.435 --> 19:58.914
They're gonna see us leaving.

19:59.004 --> 20:01.006
They're not gonna know.
They're all drunk.

20:02.942 --> 20:04.819
- You think so?
-Yeah.

20:04.910 --> 20:06.048
Okay.

20:09.315 --> 20:11.317
Where are you kids going?
Can I give you a ride'?

20:12.952 --> 20:15.728
KO, I spoke with the medic.
He said everything's fine...

20:15.821 --> 20:18.495
as long as you use
your protective glove when you pee.

20:20.359 --> 20:22.397
- What?
- It's a joke.

20:22.496 --> 20:23.804
Yeah, it better be.

20:24.831 --> 20:27.334
That's about the size of it!

20:44.018 --> 20:46.259
Here's to nasty sex,

20:46.354 --> 20:48.698
- and women who never say no.
- Yeah!

20:49.791 --> 20:52.294
Here's to Lucky,

20:52.393 --> 20:54.270
the Marine who gave
his life today.

20:56.531 --> 20:57.977
To Lucky.

21:01.136 --> 21:03.116
- In here.
-Okay.

21:16.519 --> 21:17.793
What is this?

21:21.157 --> 21:22.727
Let me take off
your belt.

21:38.476 --> 21:40.387
Oh, baby.

21:40.478 --> 21:42.754
Shake hands with the Big Guy.

21:46.817 --> 21:49.855
Take it easy.
You don't want to hurt Mr. Snake.

21:53.325 --> 21:55.669
What is it'?
What's wrong?

21:57.929 --> 22:01.240
Ouch! Not so rough!
You want to take it home with you?

22:01.333 --> 22:03.643
I haven't done anything yet.

22:05.270 --> 22:06.715
Ouch!

22:06.805 --> 22:08.216
What's wrong?

22:10.275 --> 22:11.277
- What?
- God!

22:17.917 --> 22:19.055
What did I do'?

22:22.488 --> 22:23.990
Aaah! God!

22:26.159 --> 22:28.070
What the hell's
going on in there?

22:45.112 --> 22:47.059
Kowalski, my God!
What is it'?

22:49.184 --> 22:51.425
Let that be a lesson
to you, lad.

22:51.519 --> 22:53.226
Always wear a prophylactic.

22:58.059 --> 22:59.538
<i>Bernie...</i>

23:07.836 --> 23:09.782
Hold it right there,
pilgrim.

23:10.973 --> 23:13.214
I'm not gonna hurt ya.

23:14.310 --> 23:16.449
No, I'm not gonna hurt ya.

23:20.316 --> 23:21.624
The hell I'm not!

23:28.491 --> 23:30.129
Come on,
this is getting boring.

23:37.133 --> 23:38.942
I think there's someone
in the house.

23:42.707 --> 23:44.277
Get it while
the gettin's good.

23:44.375 --> 23:47.515
- I'm gonna get a refill.
- Get me one, too.

23:47.612 --> 23:51.321
Bring me back a sandwich.
Oh, and a pack of cigarettes.

23:51.415 --> 23:54.953
- I'll catch you later.
- He ain't coming back for a while.

23:55.052 --> 23:56.895
He ain't coming back
for a while.

23:58.289 --> 24:01.066
Small though I am,
mighty is my spirit

24:01.159 --> 24:03.161
when bloody battle calls.

24:03.262 --> 24:05.742
Come at me
with what you will,

24:05.831 --> 24:08.812
shoot me, stab me,
kill me a hundred ways

24:08.900 --> 24:10.709
and still I fight on.

24:10.802 --> 24:12.577
I am eternal as the sun.

24:12.671 --> 24:15.311
I am a thousand demons
from hell.

24:15.407 --> 24:18.582
Death and destruction
are my game.

24:18.678 --> 24:21.852
Agony is my name!
Ha, ha!

24:24.284 --> 24:26.628
So how's the casualty?

24:26.719 --> 24:28.995
She's resting comfortably,
more or less.

24:30.356 --> 24:32.393
We won't be able
to save her hand.

24:32.492 --> 24:34.631
Too much arterial damage.

24:34.727 --> 24:36.104
That's tough.

24:37.865 --> 24:41.108
- So you're a doctor, right'?
- A biologist.

24:41.201 --> 24:43.738
A doctor of biology.

24:43.837 --> 24:46.909
That must mean you're
pretty smart, then.

24:47.007 --> 24:49.112
Smart's a relative term.

24:49.209 --> 24:50.745
Relative to what?

24:50.844 --> 24:54.291
Relative to the level
of intelligence you're referring to.

24:54.381 --> 24:57.556
What are the criteria for
determining a person's intelligence?

24:58.687 --> 25:00.166
<i>Uhh...</i>

25:00.255 --> 25:05.329
That means, what standards
do you use? Prerequisites.

25:05.427 --> 25:08.806
I know what "criteria" means, Doc,
and what a "prerequisite" is.

25:08.897 --> 25:11.309
See, Doc,just because
I wear this uniform

25:11.399 --> 25:13.641
doesn't mean they've surgically
removed my brain.

25:13.736 --> 25:15.443
Well, I didn't mean--

25:15.538 --> 25:17.347
anyway---

25:17.440 --> 25:20.182
the point is that
I was just thinking that...

25:20.276 --> 25:23.382
I'd kind of like to
get to know you better.

25:23.479 --> 25:26.619
But since you obviously think
of me as a Neanderthal...

25:26.716 --> 25:29.356
- Why are you so defensive?
- I am not defensive.

25:29.452 --> 25:31.433
I'll shoot anyone who says
I'm defensive.

25:38.528 --> 25:40.132
Okay, what the hell.

25:42.799 --> 25:45.871
You know what? Why don't we
forget that I was here?

25:45.969 --> 25:47.676
Come back when you're
feeling better.

25:47.771 --> 25:49.877
I feel a lot better
than I look.

25:54.679 --> 25:56.454
I'll bet you do.

26:14.266 --> 26:17.213
I get the impression that
you don't like me.

26:17.302 --> 26:20.681
Don't bother to deny it.
You really don't like me, do you?

26:26.980 --> 26:29.483
First dates are always the hardest.
Oooh!

26:37.123 --> 26:39.660
Damn, 21 st century
and they still can't dance.

26:42.529 --> 26:43.838
They're getting better.

26:43.931 --> 26:45.433
I was about to call
the medics.

26:46.767 --> 26:49.043
Nothing wrong with being a Marine,
is there, Sticks?

26:49.136 --> 26:51.878
Hell no.
Semper fi, do or die.

26:51.972 --> 26:53.679
It's all
I ever wanted to be.

26:53.774 --> 26:55.219
You made it, so be happy.

26:55.309 --> 26:57.346
I am happy...

26:57.445 --> 26:59.823
till somebody like her
comes around.

26:59.914 --> 27:02.395
- You don't like her now?
- No, I do.

27:02.484 --> 27:03.724
That's the problem.

27:03.819 --> 27:05.924
- Wait, come again?
- Come on, think about it.

27:06.021 --> 27:07.830
We're not exactly
made for each other.

27:07.923 --> 27:10.096
A PhD. and
a high school diploma?

27:10.192 --> 27:12.365
Conversations might tend
to be one-sided.

27:12.461 --> 27:14.805
It depends on
what you're talking about.

27:14.896 --> 27:16.068
That's the problem.

27:16.164 --> 27:18.576
I might not know
what we're talking about.

27:21.337 --> 27:22.680
It's alive!

27:32.748 --> 27:34.386
Hello.

28:03.047 --> 28:05.527
<i>Oh... look at those knees.</i>

28:10.755 --> 28:12.132
Yes!

28:31.510 --> 28:33.080
Impossible!

28:33.179 --> 28:34.783
<i>No, Harold...</i>

28:34.881 --> 28:37.691
it is not impossible.

28:37.784 --> 28:40.196
Her tissues
have regenerated.

28:42.989 --> 28:44.627
I wasn't really...

28:44.724 --> 28:47.398
Yes, Harold,
I know what you were doing.

28:47.494 --> 28:50.964
You are a naughty,
naughty boy.

28:53.034 --> 28:54.741
<i>She is...</i>

28:54.835 --> 28:56.678
amazing, is she not'?

28:58.506 --> 29:00.918
Yes, sir.

29:01.008 --> 29:03.318
We have work to do.

29:03.411 --> 29:06.187
Do you know what I could do
with her DNA?

29:07.949 --> 29:09.861
Do you, Harold'?

29:09.952 --> 29:10.930
No.

29:11.019 --> 29:13.966
You'll tell no one what
you've seen here, understand?

29:14.056 --> 29:15.057
No one.

29:15.157 --> 29:16.795
No one?

29:16.892 --> 29:19.168
But this is a great
discovery!

29:19.261 --> 29:20.934
Yes.

29:21.029 --> 29:22.599
<i>But for now...</i>

29:22.698 --> 29:24.678
It will be our secret.

29:35.645 --> 29:37.955
- Take this.
- I don't believe in guns.

29:38.047 --> 29:40.755
You need more
than a PhD., Doc.

29:40.850 --> 29:43.660
For your information, Sergeant,
I have a black belt in karate.

29:43.753 --> 29:44.993
Huh.

29:45.088 --> 29:48.002
I needed a merit badge
when I was in the Scouts.

29:48.092 --> 29:49.867
Scouts, huh?

29:49.960 --> 29:52.668
Should have told me earlier.
I would have taken the day off.

29:59.436 --> 30:01.313
It'll take more than penicillin
to fix that shit.

30:01.405 --> 30:03.180
Shut up, Danny!

30:03.273 --> 30:05.049
Knock it off!
Knock it off!

30:05.143 --> 30:08.124
We got to find it before
it does any more damage.

30:09.414 --> 30:11.052
All right,
let's check this place out.

30:11.149 --> 30:13.652
You can't go in there.
That's the waste disposal chamber.

30:13.752 --> 30:15.493
We can go anywhere
we want, lady.

30:15.587 --> 30:16.691
We're Marines.

30:16.788 --> 30:19.962
It's filled with
flesh-eating bacteria.

30:20.058 --> 30:22.095
Mooch, you're up.

30:22.193 --> 30:23.434
Hey, wait a minute.

30:23.529 --> 30:25.531
What do you mean,
flesh-eating bacteria?

30:25.631 --> 30:27.770
That's how they dispose
of the organic waste.

30:27.867 --> 30:29.710
He's got to wear
protective clothing.

30:29.802 --> 30:32.112
I can go with him
and show him what to do.

30:32.204 --> 30:34.684
Sergeant, we can't let her
go in there.

30:34.774 --> 30:37.311
I'm the only one who knows how
to run the equipment.

30:37.410 --> 30:38.354
She goes.

30:39.879 --> 30:41.188
I gave you an order.

30:41.281 --> 30:43.318
She goes as far as
the air lock.

30:43.417 --> 30:44.794
Mooch and I go in.

30:44.885 --> 30:46.592
- Yeah.
- All right.

30:47.554 --> 30:48.965
Let's go.

30:50.524 --> 30:52.731
This is the decontamination
chamber.

30:52.826 --> 30:55.705
You'll kill any bacteria
in the air lock.

30:55.796 --> 30:58.470
I'll let you out into
the main chamber from here.

30:58.565 --> 31:00.136
- Got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

31:00.234 --> 31:02.874
- Don't want it, but I got it.
- A walk in the park, right'?

31:02.970 --> 31:03.880
- Yeah.
- All right.

31:20.055 --> 31:22.899
Okay, Mooch,
you go that way.

31:24.993 --> 31:26.370
Keep in touch, huh?

31:57.094 --> 31:58.801
Hey, Mooch,
are you all right'?

31:58.896 --> 32:01.740
Yeah, I'm just doing great.
Let's head back now.

32:02.867 --> 32:03.902
Nope.

32:06.203 --> 32:08.183
- Oh shoot!
- What's the matter, man?

32:08.272 --> 32:10.309
- My God!
- Talk to me, talk to me.

32:10.407 --> 32:12.479
Books-- Books!

32:12.577 --> 32:16.115
I'm all right.
Walked into a shitstorm.

32:16.214 --> 32:17.784
Looks like lubricant.

32:17.883 --> 32:20.124
Probably runoff
from the hydraulic system.

32:27.726 --> 32:29.296
Jesus!

32:29.394 --> 32:30.840
God damn!

32:36.335 --> 32:39.873
Books,
I don't think he's here, man.

32:39.972 --> 32:41.645
Yeah,
I guess you're right.

32:41.741 --> 32:44.517
Let's make our way back.
We've wasted enough time already.

32:44.610 --> 32:45.884
Amen.

32:49.249 --> 32:51.889
Mooch, where are you?
What's happening? Mooch!

32:54.388 --> 32:56.197
Oh,Jesus!

32:57.057 --> 32:58.058
Books!

32:59.159 --> 33:00.604
Books,
what's happening?

33:01.962 --> 33:04.033
I got you.

33:04.131 --> 33:07.136
You'll be okay.
Hang in there, big guy.

33:08.937 --> 33:12.783
Give me the princess and
I'll spare your miserable lives.

33:12.874 --> 33:14.376
Come out,
you little bastard!

33:17.178 --> 33:19.249
Open the door
for decontamination.

33:28.557 --> 33:30.093
Books, are you all right'?

33:30.192 --> 33:31.364
It's Mooch.

33:34.196 --> 33:35.539
Oh, my God.

33:49.012 --> 33:50.286
Hey!

33:51.448 --> 33:54.657
I'm sorry.
Do you have an appointment?

33:56.286 --> 33:58.197
Listen,
you pencil-necked geek!

33:58.288 --> 33:59.665
You give me the doctorâ€œ now,

33:59.756 --> 34:02.601
before I knock out your teeth
and shit down your throat!

34:04.262 --> 34:07.106
Thank you,
I've already had my lunch.

34:07.198 --> 34:08.938
Funny.

34:09.033 --> 34:10.876
<i>Dr. Mittenhand...</i>

34:12.402 --> 34:14.815
something wants
to talk to you.

34:15.873 --> 34:19.583
Gentlemen, ladies.

34:19.678 --> 34:23.023
I've been expecting you.

34:23.114 --> 34:25.891
I have been tracking
your activities.

34:25.984 --> 34:28.396
I understand that
the creature we are after

34:28.487 --> 34:31.058
has offered to spare us
any more difficulty

34:31.156 --> 34:36.264
if we simply give him the beautiful
princess now resting in my lab.

34:36.360 --> 34:37.931
Yes, sir.

34:38.031 --> 34:41.774
Since we've lost three men already,
it might be a good idea.

34:41.868 --> 34:44.178
I don't agree,
Sergeant.

34:44.270 --> 34:46.511
The princes is part of

34:46.606 --> 34:49.951
a very important
scientific experiment.

34:51.077 --> 34:55.047
If that means killing that creature
out there, so be it.

34:55.148 --> 34:57.527
Those are my orders.
Harold, show them out.

34:57.618 --> 34:58.995
Dismissed!

34:59.086 --> 35:01.362
Sit your ass down,
Harold.

35:01.622 --> 35:05.069
Sir, with all due respect,
we're not going anywhere.

35:05.159 --> 35:08.038
You refuse to obey me'?

35:08.128 --> 35:10.301
I'm not gonna risk
the lives of my men

35:10.397 --> 35:12.809
so you can fart around
with test tubes and formulas.

35:12.900 --> 35:16.542
I say we give her up and we can
all get out of here in one piece.

35:16.638 --> 35:19.414
You dare to defy me'?!

35:19.507 --> 35:21.748
In a couple of hours
our contract's up!

35:21.843 --> 35:23.322
When that clock strikes
midnight,

35:23.411 --> 35:24.890
we're climbing
in our shuttle

35:24.980 --> 35:27.324
and we're headed
for home.

35:27.415 --> 35:30.555
I think not, Sergeant.

35:32.153 --> 35:33.792
Let's get out of here!

35:33.889 --> 35:36.597
No one leaves this ship
without my permission.

35:36.692 --> 35:38.137
No one!

35:38.227 --> 35:39.501
Yeah, right!

35:49.572 --> 35:52.315
- Holy shit.
- Oh, my God.

35:57.981 --> 35:59.824
Dr. Mittenhand,

35:59.916 --> 36:03.955
you look much taller...
in person.

36:04.054 --> 36:06.125
Thank you, Harold.

36:06.223 --> 36:08.203
I'll do the jokes.

36:11.396 --> 36:15.708
So, I am not what
you expected.

36:15.800 --> 36:17.336
No matter.

36:17.435 --> 36:20.939
Don't look quite so horrified,
Doctor.

36:21.039 --> 36:25.510
I'm still the seductively brilliant
and powerful man I was before.

36:26.611 --> 36:30.219
Rather like
the Wizard of Oz,

36:30.315 --> 36:32.295
I always think,

36:32.384 --> 36:36.127
running things from behind
a curtain.

36:36.221 --> 36:38.895
The only difference,
gentlemen,

36:38.991 --> 36:42.632
is that this wizard
is not a fake!

36:59.446 --> 37:02.222
In spite of my appearance,
I'm quite capable

37:02.315 --> 37:05.422
of running this ship
and everything on it.

37:05.519 --> 37:10.043
Make no mistake.
I am in command!

37:10.078 --> 37:12.092
You will do as I say.

37:13.661 --> 37:18.717
We have a contract, Sergeant,
do we not'?

37:18.752 --> 37:19.901
Yes.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.493
Your time is up,
it is true.

37:22.528 --> 37:26.979
But sub-paragraph four
states I have the power

37:27.075 --> 37:31.315
to extend your contract
in the event of an emergency.

37:31.413 --> 37:34.935
And that is what
I'm going to do!

37:41.023 --> 37:44.061
If you disobey my orders...

37:44.160 --> 37:46.731
and refuse to carry them out,

37:46.829 --> 37:48.866
you will be tried for mutiny

37:48.965 --> 37:51.206
and I promise you,
you will be shot!

37:52.735 --> 37:55.773
If, on the other hand,
you follow my orders,

37:55.872 --> 37:58.444
and manage to kill
this creature,

37:58.542 --> 38:01.648
I will arrange
a very generous bonus

38:01.745 --> 38:03.486
for each of you.

38:03.580 --> 38:04.820
How much'?

38:04.915 --> 38:09.830
Say one hundred times
what you're being paid now.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.866
- Sounds good to me.
- I'm in.

38:11.955 --> 38:14.799
You can count me in.
But I'm not doing it for the money.

38:14.892 --> 38:16.736
I'm doing this for Kowalski.

38:16.828 --> 38:18.398
Books?

38:18.496 --> 38:19.736
I'm a Marine, Sarge.

38:19.831 --> 38:23.438
You want me to stay,
I'll stay.

38:23.535 --> 38:26.277
Anybody who stays
becomes a shareholder...

38:26.371 --> 38:28.351
of everything you make
on this deal.

38:28.439 --> 38:31.045
And we want 5%
of the gross...

38:31.142 --> 38:33.520
of everything you bring
out of that cave.

38:33.611 --> 38:35.785
Anything over 50 million,

38:35.881 --> 38:38.384
we get another point
as a bonus.

38:38.484 --> 38:41.363
Two and a half percent
of the mineral rights.

38:41.453 --> 38:44.024
That's net, not gross.
No bonus.

38:44.123 --> 38:46.865
Four percent.
No deal without the bonus.

38:46.959 --> 38:48.996
- Three percent with the bonus.
- Done!

38:49.094 --> 38:50.505
I'll have the papers
drawn up.

38:52.498 --> 38:54.911
One more thing.
If I lose any more of my troop,

38:55.001 --> 38:56.605
your ass is grass!

38:58.171 --> 39:00.947
If you've even got an ass!
Let's go!

39:02.909 --> 39:05.014
Call me if you need me.

39:21.562 --> 39:22.700
<i>Sticks...</i>

39:22.797 --> 39:24.834
- you and Danny take the sub-levels.
- Yes, sir.

39:24.932 --> 39:26.240
- Books...
-Sir?

39:26.334 --> 39:29.475
You and Cupcake take the engine room
and everything around it.

39:29.571 --> 39:30.743
- Delores...
- Sarge?

39:30.839 --> 39:32.341
You're with me.

39:32.641 --> 39:34.912
Stay close. Stay in touch,
and use your locators

39:35.010 --> 39:37.638
to track that alien.
Move out!

39:42.050 --> 39:44.428
Good lads,
stouthearted and brave.

39:44.519 --> 39:46.499
Seems almost a pity
to kill them.

39:46.588 --> 39:50.435
But the path to power is often
soiled with innocent blood

39:50.526 --> 39:54.099
and I will let nothing
stop me from becoming a king.

39:54.197 --> 39:57.076
I'll have power and glory...

39:57.166 --> 40:00.511
and a beautiful queen
to share it with.

40:02.405 --> 40:04.407
"Share."

40:04.507 --> 40:07.887
There's a word that lies
crooked upon me.

40:07.978 --> 40:11.050
The very sound of it sets
my teeth to grate.

40:11.148 --> 40:14.129
Conjures up pictures of me gold
being carted off

40:14.218 --> 40:16.789
to pay for feminine
pleasures,

40:16.887 --> 40:19.959
leaving me with less than
what I want.

40:20.057 --> 40:22.833
And what I want is everything.

40:23.928 --> 40:26.670
I'll wed her,
bed her, and bury her,

40:26.765 --> 40:29.905
all in the same day.
Ha ha!

40:30.001 --> 40:34.143
I wonder if her father will pay
for the wedding and the funeral.

40:53.993 --> 40:55.904
- What's wrong?
- It ain't working.

40:55.995 --> 40:58.271
Shit!

40:58.364 --> 41:01.312
- Sarge, you there?
- Yeah.

41:01.401 --> 41:03.381
Our locator isn't working,

41:03.470 --> 41:05.711
so if anybody spots him--

41:05.806 --> 41:07.046
All right.

41:07.140 --> 41:08.813
- Ready?
- Listen close, man.

41:08.909 --> 41:11.287
- Let's sit this one out.
- Say what?

41:11.378 --> 41:14.587
We find a nice, safe place
to hold up till they catch the bastard.

41:14.681 --> 41:16.524
We collect our bonus
and go home.

41:16.616 --> 41:19.461
Why risk our lives for that maniac,
Dr. Mittenhand'?

41:19.554 --> 41:22.262
Did you get a look
at that guy'?

41:22.357 --> 41:23.802
He ain't hardly human.

41:23.891 --> 41:25.165
This isn't about him.

41:25.259 --> 41:27.967
It's about us sticking
together and doing our job.

41:28.062 --> 41:31.441
I ain't taking any chances,
you understand?

41:31.532 --> 41:33.011
Move your ass, Danny.

41:51.553 --> 41:53.294
You wait here.

41:53.389 --> 41:54.960
I'll check out the next level.

41:55.058 --> 41:56.765
I'll go first.

42:05.635 --> 42:09.082
I'm ready to proceed, Doctor.
I've got a sample of her blood.

42:12.275 --> 42:13.778
<i>Ahem...</i>

42:15.312 --> 42:17.019
Gentle.

42:20.785 --> 42:22.025
Sorry.

42:58.991 --> 43:01.494
I am brilliant!

43:19.146 --> 43:21.057
- Hey, Sarge?
- Yeah?

43:22.716 --> 43:26.221
You don't think Kowalski's
gettin' killed was my fault, do you?

43:26.321 --> 43:27.527
What do you mean?

43:29.824 --> 43:33.362
I mean, I'm the one
who gave him a boner.

43:34.462 --> 43:37.568
Forget about it. Kowalski
would have wanted it that way.

43:37.665 --> 43:40.043
He was a Marine.

43:40.134 --> 43:43.308
<i>Come to think of it,
when it's my time to go...</i>

43:43.404 --> 43:45.976
I hope I'm standing tall
like he was.

43:48.444 --> 43:49.821
Really?

44:10.834 --> 44:13.838
Lordy, Mr. Daniels,
it sure be dark in here.

44:13.937 --> 44:15.177
Laugh it up, wise guy.

44:15.272 --> 44:18.742
Won't be so funny when that bastard
shoves a laser up your ass.

44:18.842 --> 44:23.417
A laser up my ass?
Come on, feets, don't fail me now!

44:23.514 --> 44:25.892
Come on, Mr. Daniels.

44:25.983 --> 44:27.223
Dick.

44:40.365 --> 44:42.845
Got him.
Sarge?

44:42.935 --> 44:44.881
Yeah.

44:44.970 --> 44:47.177
- He's here.
- Where are you?

44:47.272 --> 44:50.082
Engine room.

44:50.175 --> 44:53.679
Everyone copy that?
Sticks? Danny'?

44:56.481 --> 44:58.393
Getting nothing.
No static, nothing.

44:58.484 --> 45:00.657
It's because we're in a deep,
dark hole.

45:00.753 --> 45:02.198
Let's get outta here.

45:02.288 --> 45:03.460
Sticks?

45:04.757 --> 45:06.703
Hang in there, Books.
We're on our way.

45:09.162 --> 45:10.641
We're going after him,
aren't we?

45:10.730 --> 45:12.175
<i>Not "we."
Me.</i>

45:12.265 --> 45:14.211
You're going back.
I'm waiting for the others.

45:14.300 --> 45:17.145
Damn it! I am part of this operation.
I have a job to do!

45:17.237 --> 45:20.707
Part of my job is making sure
that nothing happens to you.

45:20.808 --> 45:21.912
I'm not going back.

45:22.009 --> 45:23.420
<i>- Listen, Doc, you don't...
- Tina.</i>

45:23.510 --> 45:25.956
- What?
- My name is Tina.

45:26.046 --> 45:28.424
Listen, Tina,
you're in the way here.

45:28.515 --> 45:30.961
You can't shoot a gun.
You're not trained for combat.

45:31.051 --> 45:32.428
You'll get us both killed.

45:32.519 --> 45:36.468
I can assure you I am quite
capable of taking care of myself.

45:36.558 --> 45:40.563
Okay, fine, we'll both go.
You go first.

45:40.662 --> 45:42.403
- You go first.
- God!

46:03.119 --> 46:05.224
You're busted, lad.

46:05.321 --> 46:07.198
Give me back the princess,

46:07.289 --> 46:09.998
or I'll barbecue your buns
to a crisp.

46:14.531 --> 46:15.669
Get out of here.
Go!

46:15.766 --> 46:18.269
- What about you?
- Never mind me. Get outta here!

46:18.368 --> 46:21.349
How do you like it'?
Medium or well done'?

46:23.440 --> 46:24.680
I'm not leaving you here!

46:30.148 --> 46:31.320
Get outta here!

46:31.416 --> 46:33.157
Hot stuff, coming up!

46:41.225 --> 46:42.260
Go!

46:46.832 --> 46:48.368
Get on the hoist.
Let's go.

46:52.037 --> 46:54.108
- You on'?
- Uh-huh.

46:54.206 --> 46:55.446
Going UP-

46:58.677 --> 47:01.783
Clever, lad.
But I'll roast you yet.

47:01.880 --> 47:04.451
This barbecue's only
just begun.

47:09.255 --> 47:10.757
Are you all right'?

47:10.857 --> 47:12.768
You saved my life.

47:14.928 --> 47:16.532
Part of the job.

47:18.398 --> 47:20.036
You can put me down, now.

47:24.472 --> 47:26.645
You're really good
with that rifle.

47:26.741 --> 47:29.449
Maybe I could...

47:29.543 --> 47:31.250
teach you
how to use it some time.

47:32.279 --> 47:34.725
I don't think that
I'm the killer type.

47:37.118 --> 47:40.258
Right time, right place...

47:40.354 --> 47:42.062
we're all killers.

47:46.428 --> 47:47.736
- Hey, Sarge.
- You get him?

47:47.829 --> 47:49.831
He got away.
Where's Danny and Sticks?

47:49.931 --> 47:51.205
I don't know.

47:51.299 --> 47:54.246
I gave the order to converge.
Must be on their way.

47:55.537 --> 47:58.040
Sarge, you read me'?

47:58.140 --> 47:59.449
Books?

48:02.645 --> 48:03.783
anybody?

48:03.880 --> 48:06.622
Damn it. I told you we should
have never come down here.

48:06.716 --> 48:08.821
Will you relax, Danny!

48:08.918 --> 48:10.761
Cheap-ass equipment.
Nothing works.

48:10.853 --> 48:12.127
Gotta be an exit
coming up soon.

48:14.223 --> 48:15.395
What the hell was that?

48:16.793 --> 48:18.637
Hello?

48:18.729 --> 48:21.005
Anybody here?

48:21.498 --> 48:23.444
I think we found him.

48:23.534 --> 48:25.514
I'm outta here.

48:25.602 --> 48:27.411
Danny,
get your ass back here.

48:44.055 --> 48:45.864
Danny!

48:45.957 --> 48:46.867
<i>Shit.</i>

48:46.958 --> 48:49.063
Danny, open the door.
My light went out.

48:49.160 --> 48:50.764
That's an order.

48:53.665 --> 48:55.339
Hello,
Danny boy.

48:55.434 --> 48:58.472
Let's talk about safety
in the workplace.

49:03.108 --> 49:04.018
Oops!

49:06.445 --> 49:09.426
Be very careful when handling
sharp instruments.

49:13.186 --> 49:15.097
And watch out
for naked flames.

49:17.657 --> 49:20.137
As Shakespeare said,
"Shit happens."

49:22.662 --> 49:29.079
"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes,
the pipes are playing..."

49:33.941 --> 49:37.388
What's the matter, lad'?
Don't like me singing?

49:37.478 --> 49:39.389
Listen to me.

49:39.480 --> 49:41.892
I got no fight with you.

49:41.983 --> 49:43.985
You want that alien broad'?
Take her.

49:44.085 --> 49:46.065
Hell, I don't care.

49:46.153 --> 49:48.099
You understand?

49:48.189 --> 49:49.726
I just want to live.

49:49.825 --> 49:53.967
Of course you do.
But I'm not after you, lad.

49:54.062 --> 49:56.542
- You're not'?
- No.

49:56.632 --> 50:00.045
As a matter of fact,
I could use your help.

50:00.135 --> 50:02.115
Oh, yeah?

50:02.204 --> 50:06.414
Yeah. Maybe we could
be partners.

50:06.508 --> 50:08.546
That'd be okay with me.

50:08.645 --> 50:12.559
But, uh, I don't know if
I could trust you, lad.

50:12.649 --> 50:14.595
Nah, you could trust me.

50:14.684 --> 50:18.461
Let's talk it over,
face to face.

50:18.554 --> 50:21.501
Sure. Why not'?

50:21.591 --> 50:22.729
Where are you?

50:22.825 --> 50:25.739
Over here.
Behind these pipes.

50:27.998 --> 50:29.534
I'll be right there.

50:37.474 --> 50:40.387
Where are you,
Danny boy'?

50:40.477 --> 50:42.650
Right here.

50:45.550 --> 50:46.824
Aaahh!

50:51.790 --> 50:55.169
Smashing.
Simply smashing.

51:12.244 --> 51:15.384
Harold,
prepare the DNA.

51:15.481 --> 51:18.428
I have computed the formula.

51:18.517 --> 51:20.623
<i>May I say
what an honor it is...</i>

51:20.721 --> 51:24.191
to be working with
such a great genius?

51:24.291 --> 51:29.934
May I say how much I loathe
and despise toadies like you?

51:30.030 --> 51:31.373
Thank you.

51:31.465 --> 51:34.912
May I say what an honor
it is to be despised

51:35.002 --> 51:37.448
by such a magnificent mind?

51:37.537 --> 51:40.712
- Oh, shut up.
- I'd love to. Thank you.

51:40.808 --> 51:44.051
Harold, I wonder
if your tiny brain

51:44.145 --> 51:48.924
could even begin to comprehend
how important this is to me.

51:49.017 --> 51:52.464
For years I have dreamt
of the opportunity

51:52.553 --> 51:55.727
to rejoin the human race.

51:55.823 --> 52:00.102
Did you know that I was once
considered quite dashing'?

52:00.195 --> 52:01.765
Really?

52:01.864 --> 52:04.140
Of course.

52:04.233 --> 52:08.306
And then...
the experiment.

52:10.939 --> 52:14.478
- The experiment?
- Yes.

52:14.577 --> 52:17.615
I would have been
the first computer

52:17.714 --> 52:19.853
with an organic structure.

52:21.151 --> 52:23.324
Something went wrong.

52:23.420 --> 52:27.027
No, Harold, it all went
according to plan.

52:27.123 --> 52:30.400
Moron! Look at me!

52:30.493 --> 52:34.203
But now, with her DNA...

52:34.298 --> 52:38.110
I shall recreate Mittenhand.

52:38.202 --> 52:41.706
I shall rise like a phoenix
from the ashes

52:41.806 --> 52:46.448
and stand triumphant
before the world.

52:46.544 --> 52:50.994
I shall be beautiful!

52:52.117 --> 52:53.926
Cool.

52:57.722 --> 52:59.599
Delores, you're up.

53:21.714 --> 53:23.057
Clear.

53:27.253 --> 53:28.392
Shit!

53:30.491 --> 53:32.437
Books,
what's going on'?

53:34.194 --> 53:36.299
Books, open it!

53:36.396 --> 53:37.466
Access denied.

53:37.564 --> 53:39.237
Get it open!
Get her, Books!

53:40.767 --> 53:42.110
Try it again, Delores.

53:42.202 --> 53:44.648
- Won't work.
- Access denied.

53:45.773 --> 53:47.309
- It's the wiring.
- Hurry up!

53:51.579 --> 53:52.717
Come on.

53:55.216 --> 53:57.093
Access denied.

53:57.185 --> 53:59.791
Couldn't your friends
make it, lass'?

53:59.888 --> 54:00.992
What's going on'?

54:03.324 --> 54:04.531
Too bad.

54:06.562 --> 54:08.132
Take this,
you son of a bitch.

54:17.373 --> 54:19.148
Sarge! I got him!

54:20.709 --> 54:23.850
- Yeah, way to go, Delores!
- Great shot, Delores!

54:26.783 --> 54:29.354
All right.
One for the good guys.

54:39.296 --> 54:40.742
Aaahhh!

54:40.831 --> 54:43.072
Shit. Open up.
Get it open, Books.

54:47.972 --> 54:49.645
You like hanging around, eh'?

54:53.044 --> 54:54.751
But there's no future
in that.

54:56.981 --> 54:58.689
Hang in there, Marine!

54:58.784 --> 55:01.025
How about a little game
me mother taught me'?

55:03.822 --> 55:06.166
This little piggy
went to market.

55:06.258 --> 55:08.829
This little piggy
stayed at home.

55:10.362 --> 55:11.932
Hang on, Delores.
Come on, man!

55:13.732 --> 55:16.076
This little piggy
had bread and butter.

55:18.504 --> 55:19.744
Open it up!

55:21.174 --> 55:23.848
And this little piggy went--

55:23.943 --> 55:25.854
"Wee, wee, wee,"
all the way home!

55:31.618 --> 55:32.688
Got it! Go!

55:32.785 --> 55:33.729
Come on!

55:37.157 --> 55:38.135
Delores!

55:41.962 --> 55:43.566
Let's go!

56:02.917 --> 56:04.487
Delores.

56:11.694 --> 56:13.367
Tina, she's gone.

56:23.839 --> 56:25.477
Kill him.

56:44.961 --> 56:46.565
You heard her...

56:47.932 --> 56:49.775
Let's get
that son of a bitch.

57:08.153 --> 57:10.224
It's ready.

57:10.322 --> 57:11.926
Finally!

57:18.130 --> 57:22.943
Ahh, the delicate scent
of my own true love.

57:27.607 --> 57:29.484
Harold, see who's
at the door.

57:40.854 --> 57:43.392
Let me in, please.
They tore off all my clothes.

57:43.491 --> 57:45.129
Let me in
before they come back.

57:45.226 --> 57:46.671
5,01'. Reeves?

57:46.761 --> 57:48.866
Just open the door.
Hurry.

57:48.963 --> 57:50.704
Okay, hang on.

57:50.798 --> 57:52.869
I have to disable
the security system.

58:00.642 --> 58:03.953
Oh,thank you,thank you.

58:04.045 --> 58:06.218
You saved my life.

58:17.759 --> 58:20.036
Aughh!

58:20.129 --> 58:23.042
Hold that for me,
will you, lad'?

58:23.132 --> 58:24.941
Make way for the king.

58:32.108 --> 58:34.679
Now where's
me future queen'?

58:34.777 --> 58:38.351
You, lad.
Where is she?

58:38.449 --> 58:41.293
You are the monster?

58:41.385 --> 58:43.262
You?!

58:46.023 --> 58:48.799
Oh, I'm sorry.
I really don't want to be rude...

58:48.892 --> 58:53.398
but I had no idea.
How very tall you are.

58:53.497 --> 58:56.502
How wonderfully amusing!

58:56.601 --> 58:58.911
You find me laughable?

58:59.003 --> 59:01.313
Only slightly, dear boy,
only slightly.

59:04.943 --> 59:08.823
And I suppose now
you'll want to kill me.

59:10.315 --> 59:14.822
Which part is it
that still lives?

59:14.920 --> 59:18.197
Is it the arm, or the bald thing
in the middle?

59:19.191 --> 59:21.068
TouchÃ©.
Yes, very good!

59:23.629 --> 59:25.870
But do not
let my appearance

59:25.965 --> 59:27.808
fool you.

59:28.968 --> 59:31.244
I was about to say
the same thing.

59:44.985 --> 59:50.060
Perhaps we could come...
to an arrangement.

59:51.425 --> 59:54.565
It appears to me that
we have a lot in common.

59:54.662 --> 59:56.335
You are a monster,

59:56.430 --> 01:00:00.435
and in my own charming way,
so am I.

01:00:00.535 --> 01:00:03.982
I am greedy,
and you are insatiable.

01:00:04.071 --> 01:00:08.316
Two peas in a pod,
don't you think?

01:00:12.714 --> 01:00:17.060
You ought to know that
what I want, you can't give me.

01:00:17.152 --> 01:00:19.894
I want a throne.
I want to be king.

01:00:19.988 --> 01:00:22.525
I want people groveling
at me feet.

01:00:22.624 --> 01:00:25.161
I want respect.

01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:28.208
Respect is nothing!

01:00:28.298 --> 01:00:31.905
Fear is what makes
the universe go round, my friend.

01:00:32.001 --> 01:00:34.345
Fear is what you want.

01:00:34.437 --> 01:00:36.849
Unfortunately...

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:39.181
you won't live
long enough

01:00:39.275 --> 01:00:41.812
to frighten anyone
ever again.

01:00:43.313 --> 01:00:44.451
Harold.

01:00:45.849 --> 01:00:47.328
Aaaahh!

01:00:52.523 --> 01:00:54.264
Thanks for returning it, lad.

01:01:22.355 --> 01:01:25.165
Now, me boyo,
it's time you were punished.

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:36.080
I got him. He's in the lab.
Let's go!

01:01:50.417 --> 01:01:51.487
Aaaahh!

01:01:54.755 --> 01:01:57.235
She loves me.

01:01:57.324 --> 01:01:59.965
Oh, it's you.

01:02:00.061 --> 01:02:04.203
I had a dream that
he was draining my blood.

01:02:04.298 --> 01:02:05.777
Destroy him.

01:02:05.867 --> 01:02:07.676
Yes, of course.

01:02:07.769 --> 01:02:11.046
But I have something wonderful
in store for him, my lovely.

01:02:20.249 --> 01:02:21.455
DNA.

01:02:36.466 --> 01:02:39.675
"All things bright
and beautiful,

01:02:39.769 --> 01:02:42.943
All creatures great and small..."

01:02:43.039 --> 01:02:45.280
A little added spice.

01:03:11.636 --> 01:03:13.274
Dinner is served.

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:19.445
Now, let's see if we can't get this
through your thick skull.

01:03:19.544 --> 01:03:21.251
<i>...Doctor.</i>

01:03:34.293 --> 01:03:37.638
You like it, lad'?
It's from an old family recipe.

01:03:46.205 --> 01:03:47.981
Someone's coming.

01:03:48.075 --> 01:03:49.713
Good.

01:04:01.822 --> 01:04:04.166
Don't shoot at any
of the hostages.

01:04:04.258 --> 01:04:06.637
Let them go
or you're dead meat!

01:04:06.961 --> 01:04:08.565
Take a bite out of this.

01:04:16.905 --> 01:04:17.781
Come on!

01:04:23.612 --> 01:04:24.818
Ouch!

01:04:26.115 --> 01:04:27.958
It's burning!

01:04:28.050 --> 01:04:29.427
This way, dear.

01:04:33.656 --> 01:04:34.964
Books, help her out!

01:04:47.838 --> 01:04:49.249
Move out!

01:04:51.441 --> 01:04:54.445
Oh, God--
Dr. Mittenhand.

01:04:57.647 --> 01:04:58.887
All right,
I'm taking him out.

01:04:58.982 --> 01:05:00.963
No! You'll kill the hostage.

01:05:01.052 --> 01:05:02.395
It's them or us.

01:05:02.486 --> 01:05:05.330
I want him as bad as you,
but we can't kill innocent people.

01:05:05.423 --> 01:05:07.425
She's a member of
the Domininan royal family.

01:05:07.525 --> 01:05:09.698
I don't give a damn
if she's the Queen of Soul.

01:05:09.794 --> 01:05:11.774
That bastard killed Delores,
and I'm taking him out!

01:05:11.863 --> 01:05:13.604
- No you're not!
- Sticks, at ease!

01:05:13.698 --> 01:05:16.178
Cupcake's right.
We can't hurt the hostage.

01:05:16.267 --> 01:05:18.339
Books, you're up.

01:05:18.437 --> 01:05:19.415
Cover me.

01:05:32.050 --> 01:05:34.621
What is the meaning
of this intrusion?

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:36.359
Lady, are you all right'?

01:05:36.456 --> 01:05:40.233
Kneel before me, swine.
I am the future Queen of Dominia.

01:05:40.326 --> 01:05:41.964
Where is he?

01:05:42.061 --> 01:05:45.235
That is none of your
business, you impertinent moron.

01:05:45.331 --> 01:05:49.211
You really are beginning
to annoy me. Not a wise idea.

01:05:49.302 --> 01:05:51.304
I'm right here, laddies.

01:05:52.405 --> 01:05:54.352
Hold your fire,
hold your fire.

01:05:54.441 --> 01:05:57.149
Bullshit!
Blow his brains out!

01:05:57.244 --> 01:06:00.282
Can't do that, Sarge.
He's got the detonator.

01:06:00.381 --> 01:06:01.655
Right you are, lad.

01:06:01.749 --> 01:06:05.026
If you want to stay in one piece,
keep your distance.

01:06:05.119 --> 01:06:09.090
The princess and I will take
our hostage elsewhere.

01:06:09.189 --> 01:06:11.601
Your Highness.

01:06:11.692 --> 01:06:15.664
You may find this cruel, but your
behavior leaves me no choice.

01:06:16.798 --> 01:06:19.039
This is your fate.

01:06:20.101 --> 01:06:23.139
You have no one to blame
but yourselves.

01:06:23.238 --> 01:06:26.651
Unspeakable pain awaits you.

01:06:26.741 --> 01:06:29.449
Yeah? Well, hurt me first.

01:06:29.544 --> 01:06:33.152
Look upon them and know
that you are forever doomed,

01:06:33.249 --> 01:06:36.321
for I am she
who is all-powerful.

01:06:36.419 --> 01:06:39.923
I am Zarina,
Queen of the Damned.

01:06:42.692 --> 01:06:44.797
<i>I leave you now...</i>

01:06:44.894 --> 01:06:47.898
to ponder the remainder
of your pathetic existence.

01:06:50.867 --> 01:06:52.744
Come. We go.

01:06:52.836 --> 01:06:55.339
Atten-h ut!

01:06:55.439 --> 01:06:56.509
Yes, sir!

01:06:56.606 --> 01:06:58.882
- I can't hear you!
- Sir! Yes, sir!

01:06:58.976 --> 01:07:02.082
About face!

01:07:02.179 --> 01:07:04.716
Forward march!

01:07:09.487 --> 01:07:12.900
That girl sure knows how
to get your attention.

01:07:12.991 --> 01:07:15.494
Don't get too excited, boys.

01:07:15.593 --> 01:07:19.666
On Dominia, when a woman of royal
blood shows you her breasts...

01:07:19.764 --> 01:07:22.108
it's a death sentence.

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:24.976
What part of her anatomy
is she gonna kill me with?

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:36.489
<i>What the hell...?</i>

01:07:38.183 --> 01:07:39.423
Come on, Tina.

01:07:46.393 --> 01:07:48.930
Hup-- Right!
Hup-- Right...

01:07:49.029 --> 01:07:50.804
We will return to Dominia
in triumph.

01:07:50.897 --> 01:07:52.740
You will sweep my father
from his throne,

01:07:52.832 --> 01:07:55.540
- and we shall rule the world.
- Yes, my queen.

01:07:55.635 --> 01:07:56.875
<i>But first...</i>

01:07:58.972 --> 01:08:01.009
...you must execute
these peasants.

01:08:01.107 --> 01:08:02.451
Have them boiled in oil.

01:08:02.543 --> 01:08:04.489
Or, perhaps we shall enjoy
seeing them eaten

01:08:04.578 --> 01:08:06.387
by the wild dogs of Naytron.

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:07.857
Leave it to me,
my lovely.

01:08:07.948 --> 01:08:10.758
They shall pay dearly
for their insolence.

01:08:10.851 --> 01:08:12.330
Sir! Yes, sir!

01:08:21.063 --> 01:08:22.837
"I know a girl
who lives on the hill.

01:08:22.930 --> 01:08:25.741
She don't do it,
but her sister will."

01:08:25.834 --> 01:08:27.245
Sir! Yes, sir!

01:08:27.335 --> 01:08:29.281
Right shoulderâ€œ arms!

01:08:30.872 --> 01:08:32.749
Now, me boyo,

01:08:32.841 --> 01:08:35.912
we'll show them what kind of man
you really are.

01:08:48.224 --> 01:08:51.261
<i>Come on... you little freak.
Where are you at'?</i>

01:09:03.372 --> 01:09:07.344
"He was standing on the corner
of 31st and Main,

01:09:07.444 --> 01:09:09.582
I was feelin' kinda flirty..."

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:11.057
Sarge?

01:09:11.548 --> 01:09:14.721
<i>"...then I knocked him
off his feet..."</i>

01:09:22.861 --> 01:09:25.899
This should be a darlin'
floor show. Don't you think?

01:09:25.997 --> 01:09:28.136
Sarge, it's me.
It's Books.

01:09:30.535 --> 01:09:32.537
Love of my life,
why are we wasting time here?

01:09:32.636 --> 01:09:36.518
Someone could be collecting
your gold.

01:09:36.609 --> 01:09:37.609
Me gold?

01:09:39.345 --> 01:09:40.585
Whoa-- Sarge.

01:09:43.482 --> 01:09:45.018
Where is it'?

01:09:45.117 --> 01:09:49.031
Someplace called...
"Cargo Bay."

01:09:53.926 --> 01:09:55.338
Delightful little fellow.

01:09:55.428 --> 01:09:57.772
I shall give him
a splendid funeral.

01:10:00.433 --> 01:10:03.039
Sarge, this is a plan, right'?
You look very nice.

01:10:03.136 --> 01:10:05.173
But tell me,
where's the alien?

01:10:06.673 --> 01:10:10.121
Sarge-- Sarge!
It's me. Knock it off.

01:10:14.081 --> 01:10:16.789
What is your malfunction, Sticks?

01:10:16.884 --> 01:10:19.125
Oh-- I can't go on
like this.

01:10:20.555 --> 01:10:22.398
Attention.
Nunchucks.

01:10:30.032 --> 01:10:33.070
- Books, I'm gonna take him out.
- Sticks, no!

01:10:33.168 --> 01:10:35.808
- He saved my life.
- He's gonna kill us.

01:10:53.756 --> 01:10:56.794
I can walk!

01:11:11.175 --> 01:11:12.882
All right. That's it.

01:11:12.977 --> 01:11:15.514
I think we've been
very patient with you, Sergeant.

01:11:15.613 --> 01:11:18.150
Now it's time to
get serious-- "Cupcake."

01:11:38.236 --> 01:11:42.845
Due to interference,
my experiment has gone awry.

01:11:42.942 --> 01:11:46.116
I am becoming a mutant,

01:11:46.212 --> 01:11:49.887
my brain slowly losing
human perspective.

01:11:51.217 --> 01:11:53.663
I am no longer Mittenhand.

01:11:55.488 --> 01:11:59.938
I am now... Mitten-spider.

01:12:05.799 --> 01:12:07.745
Damn. Nice moves.

01:12:07.834 --> 01:12:10.007
Thank you. If you'd like,
I could give you a lesson.

01:12:12.205 --> 01:12:13.411
<i>Uh-oh...</i>

01:12:13.507 --> 01:12:16.545
Kill!
Kill, kill, kill, kill!

01:12:21.449 --> 01:12:24.487
This is far too violent.
Shut up, you pussy!

01:12:24.585 --> 01:12:26.360
I've had such a headache.

01:12:26.454 --> 01:12:29.094
You're a Marine.
Snap out of it!

01:12:29.190 --> 01:12:31.033
I can't.
Kill!

01:12:33.928 --> 01:12:35.636
No, don't shoot
We can handle it.

01:12:42.871 --> 01:12:45.010
Why are you stopping?

01:12:45.107 --> 01:12:47.815
I don't want them
following me to me gold.

01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:50.413
They'll have to be destroyed.
All of them.

01:12:50.512 --> 01:12:53.722
Well, it's about time.
Do it. Do it.

01:12:53.817 --> 01:12:55.319
Bitch.

01:12:55.418 --> 01:12:56.761
Twerp.

01:13:10.166 --> 01:13:11.703
Come on!

01:13:11.802 --> 01:13:13.281
Come on, you bastard! Come on.

01:13:32.657 --> 01:13:35.331
He wasn't even human.

01:13:35.427 --> 01:13:37.168
Cyborg.

01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:41.442
Human or not,
he was a Marine.

01:13:41.533 --> 01:13:43.535
The best.

01:13:43.635 --> 01:13:45.876
Now... off with their heads!

01:13:48.408 --> 01:13:51.719
Attention-- attention,
all ship's personnel.

01:13:51.811 --> 01:13:55.122
The ship's auto-destruct
has been activated.

01:13:55.214 --> 01:13:56.989
You have 20 minutes
to abandon ship.

01:13:57.083 --> 01:13:58.892
What the hell?

01:13:58.985 --> 01:14:01.295
We gotta get to the shuttle.
Come on.

01:14:05.158 --> 01:14:08.163
You know, my father may not
want to give up the throne.

01:14:08.262 --> 01:14:10.742
No problem.
I'll kill him.

01:14:10.831 --> 01:14:14.836
How dare you?
He's my father. I'll kill him.

01:14:15.669 --> 01:14:20.675
No! You can't!
My work!

01:14:20.774 --> 01:14:25.315
Flies...
I need flies.

01:14:25.413 --> 01:14:27.188
Everything will be lost.

01:14:27.282 --> 01:14:31.287
I have to remember the code.

01:14:31.386 --> 01:14:34.026
Bring me flies.

01:14:34.122 --> 01:14:39.538
No! I must save the ship.
My work!

01:14:50.573 --> 01:14:52.985
Ah the shuttlecraft.

01:14:53.075 --> 01:14:56.989
Fully loaded instrument panel,
and real Corinthian leather.

01:15:03.186 --> 01:15:05.325
What are you doing,
you fool'?

01:15:05.422 --> 01:15:07.026
We need that thing
to escape.

01:15:07.123 --> 01:15:11.037
Yes, my queen. But first,
we must find me gold.

01:15:11.127 --> 01:15:15.166
The force field is to make sure
no on leaves without us.

01:15:15.265 --> 01:15:17.768
You ball-busting bitch.

01:15:17.868 --> 01:15:19.940
What did you say'?

01:15:20.037 --> 01:15:23.416
Rich-- you'll be rich
when we find me gold.

01:15:23.508 --> 01:15:26.114
Help me, so we can get
out of here.

01:15:26.210 --> 01:15:27.951
Locked and bolted.

01:15:39.491 --> 01:15:41.767
- Access denied.
- Shit!

01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:43.339
Is there another way in'?

01:15:43.428 --> 01:15:45.999
- What about the ventilation system?
- We're running out of time.

01:15:46.098 --> 01:15:48.078
Somebody's gotta neutralize
that auto-destruct program.

01:15:48.166 --> 01:15:49.941
- Sticks, you're up.
- Talk to me.

01:15:50.035 --> 01:15:52.413
Dr. Mittenhand had a code-book
for the computer.

01:15:52.504 --> 01:15:54.506
I saw Harold with it once.
It has a red cover.

01:15:54.606 --> 01:15:56.644
I'll find it.
Lookâ€œ.

01:15:56.743 --> 01:15:57.881
<i>If there's any reason
I can't crack it...</i>

01:15:57.977 --> 01:15:59.923
- you guys take off without me.
- No.

01:16:00.013 --> 01:16:03.654
We all go together,
or nobody goes at all.

01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:05.457
Right.

01:16:05.552 --> 01:16:08.465
Attention-- destruction
of this vessel...

01:16:08.555 --> 01:16:11.365
is in 15 minutes.
This is not a drill.

01:16:12.625 --> 01:16:15.800
I know it's here.
I can smell it.

01:16:15.896 --> 01:16:19.241
We don't have time for this.
We have to get out of here.

01:16:19.333 --> 01:16:22.280
I won't leave without me gold.
You want to go?

01:16:22.369 --> 01:16:24.815
Then go,
I won't stop you.

01:16:24.905 --> 01:16:26.907
But I can't fly the shuttle.

01:16:27.007 --> 01:16:29.510
What a pity.

01:16:29.610 --> 01:16:31.715
Then you're stuck, aren't you?

01:16:31.812 --> 01:16:35.317
You're not the only
wealthy suitor I've had.

01:16:35.417 --> 01:16:38.330
I could marry someone else.

01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:42.163
With a face like that?
I doubt it, my love.

01:16:42.257 --> 01:16:43.930
What are you talking about?

01:16:44.025 --> 01:16:46.801
I could have anyone I want.

01:16:46.895 --> 01:16:48.875
I'm beautiful.

01:16:48.964 --> 01:16:51.912
Not quite, my love.

01:16:52.001 --> 01:16:54.447
You got a tiny
little blemish,

01:16:54.537 --> 01:16:56.312
<i>right about...</i>

01:16:56.405 --> 01:16:57.713
there.

01:17:07.950 --> 01:17:09.259
What the hell?

01:17:17.561 --> 01:17:18.767
All right.

01:17:21.131 --> 01:17:22.132
All right, Sticks.

01:17:22.232 --> 01:17:23.870
Here you go.
Do your thing, baby.

01:17:23.967 --> 01:17:25.412
Come on, now.
Be a hero.

01:17:29.407 --> 01:17:30.818
Red cover.

01:17:38.349 --> 01:17:40.158
What the fuck happened to you?

01:17:45.891 --> 01:17:47.666
What's he done
to the shuttle'?

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:49.740
I don't know.
It's a force field of some kind.

01:17:49.828 --> 01:17:51.501
Touch it, and we fry.

01:17:52.064 --> 01:17:55.443
<i>All personnel, proceed
to Cargo Bay 1...</i>

01:17:55.534 --> 01:17:58.037
Let's find that little bastard,
and see if we can't cut a deal.

01:18:03.075 --> 01:18:05.283
Me gold!

01:18:05.378 --> 01:18:08.621
If we don't leave now, we're doomed.
Do you hear me'?

01:18:08.715 --> 01:18:11.696
What have they done
to me gold?

01:18:11.785 --> 01:18:13.196
This is it'?

01:18:13.286 --> 01:18:15.732
We've spent all this time
searching for pebbles?

01:18:15.822 --> 01:18:18.769
They've shrunk it
down to nothing.

01:18:18.858 --> 01:18:22.068
You're a stupid,
ugly little fool!

01:18:22.163 --> 01:18:24.803
<i>"Ugly," am I?</i>

01:18:24.899 --> 01:18:27.778
Have you looked
in a mirror lately, darlin"?

01:18:27.868 --> 01:18:30.747
Do you know what you
look like, my sweet?

01:18:30.838 --> 01:18:33.409
What are you talking about?
I know what I look like.

01:18:33.507 --> 01:18:36.454
I'm perfect.
I'm breathtaking--

01:18:36.544 --> 01:18:37.614
<i>I'm...</i>

01:18:46.621 --> 01:18:50.068
Oh, shut your cakehole,
you oozing great zit!

01:19:06.676 --> 01:19:08.485
You're fuckin' with
the wrong one now, baby.

01:19:09.545 --> 01:19:12.151
All right, here we go.
One step at a time.

01:19:33.237 --> 01:19:35.184
I'll have it all back
the way it was,

01:19:35.273 --> 01:19:37.184
me beautiful
shining gold.

01:19:37.275 --> 01:19:38.276
Hold it!

01:19:39.811 --> 01:19:41.119
You again?

01:19:41.212 --> 01:19:43.556
You don't know
when to give up.

01:19:43.648 --> 01:19:47.687
Attention--
you now have 11 minutes...

01:19:47.786 --> 01:19:49.356
Do you hear that?

01:19:49.454 --> 01:19:50.899
You can keep
your stinking gold,

01:19:50.989 --> 01:19:52.400
and take that bimbo
from hell with you.

01:19:52.490 --> 01:19:55.961
Just show us how to neutralize
the damn auto-destruct mechanism.

01:19:56.061 --> 01:19:58.564
I'll neutralize something for you.

01:20:09.909 --> 01:20:11.446
"Password"?
What damn password?

01:20:14.414 --> 01:20:16.087
Books, Tina,
can you hear me'? Come in.

01:20:18.151 --> 01:20:19.824
Books, Tina?

01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:21.593
Sticks, nice of you to call.

01:20:21.688 --> 01:20:24.601
Look, I'm kinda hung up
right now.

01:20:24.691 --> 01:20:25.863
What?

01:20:25.959 --> 01:20:29.772
The computer needs a password.
I can't stop it without a password.

01:20:29.864 --> 01:20:32.105
Tina, we've got to get up there.
He needs a password.

01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:33.975
Maybe we can help him
figure it out.

01:20:34.068 --> 01:20:35.741
Somebody's got
to take him out first.

01:20:40.575 --> 01:20:42.077
- Cover me.
- Tina, no!

01:21:22.752 --> 01:21:24.061
Tina!

01:21:38.335 --> 01:21:40.212
What did you do'?

01:21:40.304 --> 01:21:41.578
I don't know.

01:21:59.891 --> 01:22:01.838
What did you shoot him with?
Steroids?

01:22:07.099 --> 01:22:09.340
Okay...
We're going to split up.

01:22:09.435 --> 01:22:12.939
Take this, go through
that ventilation shaft, and help Sticks.

01:22:13.039 --> 01:22:14.916
Rm huge!

01:22:17.009 --> 01:22:18.956
I'm magnificent!

01:22:20.981 --> 01:22:22.460
- Go-- go.
- Okay.

01:22:26.653 --> 01:22:28.894
All right!

01:22:28.989 --> 01:22:30.969
Big is good.

01:22:50.611 --> 01:22:51.681
Hey!

01:22:54.215 --> 01:22:55.524
You want some of this?

01:22:55.617 --> 01:22:58.723
Ah-- "G. I. Squirt."

01:23:00.622 --> 01:23:02.727
Oh-- the pain!

01:23:05.394 --> 01:23:06.998
Oops.

01:23:43.768 --> 01:23:44.439
Oof!

01:24:09.028 --> 01:24:13.408
Total destruction of this vessel
will occur in 7 minutes.

01:24:13.499 --> 01:24:17.345
You should be on board
the shuttlecraft-- now.

01:24:18.504 --> 01:24:21.144
Come on, guys!
Hurry up! I need help!

01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:21.843
Hurry UP!

01:24:21.941 --> 01:24:24.581
Stop all that lovey-dovey shit
and come on!

01:24:26.346 --> 01:24:29.623
Look, guys--
hurry up! Hurry up!

01:24:29.716 --> 01:24:32.959
I need a password.
I can't stop it without a password.

01:24:34.054 --> 01:24:35.556
Books! Tina!

01:24:43.097 --> 01:24:45.738
So-- where are you,
short ass?

01:24:48.903 --> 01:24:51.315
When I find you...

01:24:51.406 --> 01:24:53.443
I'm going to peel you
like a grape.

01:25:13.929 --> 01:25:17.240
Attention--
Five minutes until detonation.

01:25:22.539 --> 01:25:24.849
You haven't got long, shorty.

01:25:30.413 --> 01:25:32.222
Sticks?

01:25:32.315 --> 01:25:34.295
Tina, get out of here.
Go back!

01:25:34.384 --> 01:25:36.386
There's a big, ugly
motherfucking spider! Go back!

01:25:37.754 --> 01:25:38.927
What's happening?

01:25:39.023 --> 01:25:40.297
Look out, Tina!

01:25:47.165 --> 01:25:48.610
Feed me!

01:26:06.451 --> 01:26:08.397
I'll get you.

01:26:10.389 --> 01:26:11.766
Feed me!

01:26:22.335 --> 01:26:23.973
Get the fuck away from me!

01:26:29.175 --> 01:26:31.587
Sticks!
Throw me your rifle!

01:26:31.678 --> 01:26:33.681
That damned spider
took my weapon!

01:26:33.781 --> 01:26:36.125
There's some liquid nitrogen
over here in the corner!

01:26:36.217 --> 01:26:37.787
Hit him with that!
Come on!

01:26:37.885 --> 01:26:39.558
Get back! Get back!

01:26:41.222 --> 01:26:42.166
Get him!

01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:47.839
Take that, you bastard!

01:26:57.239 --> 01:26:58.274
Yeah! Yeah!

01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:03.912
Now, I'll get you.

01:27:11.487 --> 01:27:13.125
Get him!

01:27:13.222 --> 01:27:16.499
<i>Help me...</i>

01:27:18.294 --> 01:27:19.637
I'm sorry.

01:27:19.729 --> 01:27:20.969
<i>Help me...</i>

01:27:32.476 --> 01:27:36.049
- Are you okay?
- I had a bad dream.

01:27:36.146 --> 01:27:38.786
We gotta get out of here.
Okay? Can you walk?

01:27:40.450 --> 01:27:42.123
Carry me?

01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:46.662
Attention-- you have three minutes
to abandon ship.

01:27:47.425 --> 01:27:48.768
- Come on
- Right.

01:27:52.930 --> 01:27:56.707
- Do these belong to you?
- Shut up!

01:27:56.801 --> 01:27:59.839
Guards, spank this one,
and bring him to my chambers.

01:28:02.907 --> 01:28:04.683
...talking about,
"Feed me, feed me."

01:28:04.777 --> 01:28:06.518
Do I look like
a fly to you?

01:28:06.612 --> 01:28:08.216
Books? What is it'?

01:28:08.314 --> 01:28:11.124
Open the outer door
to Cargo Bay 2.

01:28:12.217 --> 01:28:13.423
Books, are you sure'?

01:28:13.519 --> 01:28:14.827
Do it now!

01:28:20.225 --> 01:28:21.465
On the left.

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:23.370
Guess who?

01:28:47.555 --> 01:28:49.057
Now I'll get you.

01:28:51.659 --> 01:28:53.661
<i>My hero...</i>

01:29:05.807 --> 01:29:07.343
Great.

01:29:44.748 --> 01:29:47.524
The king is dead.

01:29:47.618 --> 01:29:50.827
Long live the queen.

01:29:50.921 --> 01:29:53.094
Let's figure this out...

01:29:53.190 --> 01:29:53.965
We can do this.
We can do this...

01:29:54.058 --> 01:29:56.265
Password...

01:29:56.361 --> 01:29:58.500
- Try "Scientist."
- "Scientist."

01:30:00.098 --> 01:30:04.410
Attention-- you have 60 seconds
to avoid detonation.

01:30:06.504 --> 01:30:08.916
It's gotta be here.

01:30:09.007 --> 01:30:11.419
I don't know, I don't know.
I can't think.

01:30:11.509 --> 01:30:14.753
Thirty seconds
before detonation.

01:30:14.847 --> 01:30:16.656
Books! Yeah, right on!

01:30:16.749 --> 01:30:18.160
<i>- Books!
-So...</i>

01:30:18.250 --> 01:30:19.888
- How are we doing over here?
- Not too good.

01:30:19.985 --> 01:30:22.192
- I can't get it.
- You can get it.

01:30:22.288 --> 01:30:24.268
- It's not working!
- Okay, think-- think.

01:30:24.356 --> 01:30:26.029
Relax. Think.

01:30:26.125 --> 01:30:27.502
I don't know shit!

01:30:27.593 --> 01:30:30.164
When we first saw him,
what did he say'?

01:30:30.262 --> 01:30:32.140
He was an egomaniac,
who thought he was a genius.

01:30:32.232 --> 01:30:33.609
Right!

01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:35.077
- No.
-Shit!

01:30:35.168 --> 01:30:37.079
"A brilliant scientist."

01:30:37.170 --> 01:30:39.480
<i>- Wizard!
- Five... four...</i>

01:30:39.573 --> 01:30:41.519
<i>three... two...</i>

01:30:41.608 --> 01:30:45.181
<i>one... detona--</i>

01:30:45.278 --> 01:30:47.121
Detonation
has been cancelled.

01:30:47.214 --> 01:30:48.454
Yes!

01:30:48.549 --> 01:30:49.926
Have a nice day.

01:30:50.318 --> 01:30:51.797
Yes!

01:30:55.223 --> 01:30:56.634
Damn!

01:30:56.724 --> 01:30:58.795
I guess I don't get none.

01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:01.071
Check it out.

01:31:01.162 --> 01:31:03.039
Somebody went all to pieces
out there, huh?

01:31:07.803 --> 01:31:09.976
Completely fell apart,
didn't he?

01:31:15.844 --> 01:31:17.881
Same to you, pal.

01:31:17.980 --> 01:31:19.926
<i>Way to go.
Way to work.</i>

01:31:22.017 --> 01:31:24.224
- Now, you're a Marine.
- Thanks.
