[music continues

00:33.367 --> 00:37.436
Like, I remember the first
naked man I ever saw.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.775
I was like six or something

00:42.777 --> 00:47.112
and I remember coming
out of my bedroom to get...

00:49.150 --> 00:51.450
I don't know, cereal or
whatever and

00:52.353 --> 00:54.787
this man,
like laying on the couch

00:54.789 --> 01:00.059
and like, I swear, his dick and
everything is just hanging.

01:00.528 --> 01:02.795
'Cause I don't fucking know,

01:02.797 --> 01:04.563
he's laying sideways
or whatever.

01:05.633 --> 01:11.804
So I remember 'cause his
crotch was like white.

01:13.107 --> 01:15.407
I mean like really white.

01:16.243 --> 01:19.645
Whiter than his legs
and stomach and...

01:22.583 --> 01:25.084
I don't know, that just
seemed crazy to me.

01:25.086 --> 01:28.487
So I'm just staring

01:29.423 --> 01:32.758
eating my cereal and
my mom wakes up

01:32.760 --> 01:34.793
and I fucking think I'm
going to get in trouble

01:34.795 --> 01:37.629
but she yells at
the guy instead.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.298
Swear to God.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.567
Fucking woke him up
and kicked his ass out.

01:45.339 --> 01:47.473
I felt [chuckles]...

01:47.475 --> 01:49.374
You know I felt fucking
bad for him

01:49.376 --> 01:53.112
'cause I know my mom probably
told him to sleep there.

01:57.518 --> 01:59.184
We still have that couch too.

02:10.531 --> 02:13.899
Have you ever seen a girl
naked before, like, in person?

02:17.805 --> 02:19.138
Not really.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.443
It's Benny, right?

02:25.746 --> 02:27.546
You a sophomore, Benny?

Going to be a junior
after summer's over.

You're going to get
us pulled over.

-[laughter and screaming]

05:41.408 --> 05:42.941
I knew it.

05:43.477 --> 05:44.976
That's gross.

05:44.978 --> 05:47.379
That's 'cause Cherry's mom
goes to church and shit.

Shut up, she's basically
a virgin too.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.518
Oh, she let that boy put it in.

-It was like this.

than a tampon to count.

you were there.

shit counts.

Hey, Jason.

06:53.881 --> 06:57.015
[mom] She's like a
nurse's assistant

06:57.418 --> 06:59.151
which means she's working
beside doctors,

06:59.153 --> 07:00.819
like she's working
with real doctors.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.421
Mom, we're not drinking.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.593
-And you, baby girl.
-Yes.

I'm taking the fucking
exit exam tomorrow, mom,

08:00.113 --> 08:01.713
I'm not trying to get lit.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.121
She didn't graduate.

08:12.893 --> 08:16.561
I was going to go for my
GED, but I got pregnant.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.965
I still graduate if I pass.

-You got it.
-I don't know.

It's like when you can
see or sense something

08:57.838 --> 08:59.538
before it actually happens.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.706
-Yeah, that's basically it.
-No one asked you.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.276
Why the fuck are you
even going to college?

09:04.278 --> 09:06.011
I'm not going after
my senior year.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.913
Exactly, fuck college.

Are you going to go to
college if you pass?

09:52.793 --> 09:54.893
Heard that test is hard as fuck.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.995
I don't care about college.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.163
[Candace] Then why
are you making

10:01.335 --> 10:02.768
such a big deal about passing?

10:02.769 --> 10:04.202
'Cause if I pass, then I get
one step further than she did.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.136

10:06.673 --> 10:08.106
So give me the next word.

me shit, I'm thirsty.

bowling tonight.

Where's my mom?

11:39.066 --> 11:39.998

stupid in a tie.

12:20.974 --> 12:21.906
You ever tried it?

12:24.311 --> 12:25.243
What's it do?

12:25.245 --> 12:28.179
[Jason] Whatever you
want it to do.

12:40.060 --> 12:43.962

-No, no, no, no...
-I want to go back to sleep.

[Willy] Cory.

16:43.103 --> 16:44.035
What?

16:45.138 --> 16:46.671
I don't think he wore a condom.

Can't I just use the
Plan B or something?

I don't know,
you're fucking stupid.

16:56.649 --> 16:57.749
-Lana.
-What?

16:57.751 --> 16:59.417
Can you, please, just help me?

16:59.419 --> 17:00.418
Help you?

17:00.420 --> 17:03.187
Yeah, can you just
go get me Plan B?

17:03.590 --> 17:06.124
I don't where to get
a fucking Plan B.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.558
Just go to the pharmacy
or something,

17:07.560 --> 17:09.093

17:11.464 --> 17:13.531
There's no soap, shit.

17:13.533 --> 17:14.465
[Willy] Lana.

17:16.102 --> 17:17.035
Please.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.470
They're like 25 bucks.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.606
I'll get you a pack of Reds.

17:22.342 --> 17:25.710
-[sighs]
-Please, please?

17:27.213 --> 17:28.146
I love you.

17:28.415 --> 17:29.347
Fuck you.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.292
-Out, out.
-Shut up.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.162
Bye.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.096
-Bye.
-Bye.

17:47.200 --> 17:50.234
[Candace] Oh hey, Ryan,
you want me to pick you up?

17:50.236 --> 17:51.169
Yeah.

17:56.776 --> 17:59.444
-Hey girls, good morning.
-Hey Mrs. Ellison.
-Hey Mrs. Ellison.

17:59.446 --> 18:01.712
Heard about the party last night
at the Witoker's house,
you guys go?

18:01.714 --> 18:03.114
-No.
-No, ma'am.

18:03.817 --> 18:05.283
I heard their neighbors
called the cops.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.851
-That's a bummer.
-Yeah.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.319
[Willy] Hey, I'm still
going to get you

18:08.321 --> 18:09.754
that doctor's note
for last Tuesday.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.290
Okay, and you're going to
be late to class, Willy.

18:12.292 --> 18:13.624
-Bye Mrs. Ellison.
-Bye.

18:14.494 --> 18:16.527
Hey Ryan, can you come
in for a second?

18:18.498 --> 18:19.430
Come on.

18:21.768 --> 18:22.700
I have something for you.

18:24.871 --> 18:26.170
What is it?

18:26.172 --> 18:27.839
[Mrs. Ellison] Your
letter of recommendation.

18:29.609 --> 18:30.675
I haven't passed the test yet.

18:30.677 --> 18:33.444
I spoke to the Dean of
Admissions at Evergreen.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.313
He's going to look at your
application once you pass.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.515
We'll get your transcript
sent up there.

18:38.685 --> 18:39.750
That sound good?

18:40.353 --> 18:41.285
Sure.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.520
[Mrs. Ellison]
That's where Candace

18:42.521 --> 18:43.754
is going to college, right?

18:46.392 --> 18:47.692
Look, it's going to work out.

18:47.694 --> 18:50.728
You just got to get your mom's
signature on the FAFSA forms.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.866
Have you given your mom
the forms yet?

18:56.536 --> 18:57.051
Not yet.

18:57.052 --> 18:57.567
[Mrs. Ellison] Ryan, it's
part of the paperwork,

18:57.570 --> 18:58.769

18:58.771 --> 19:00.204
-I know.
-You're going to do it?

19:00.206 --> 19:01.506
Yeah, I will.

19:01.708 --> 19:03.374
Do you have pencils
for the test?

19:04.544 --> 19:05.476
Yeah.

19:05.645 --> 19:06.577
[Mrs. Ellison] How many?

19:07.881 --> 19:08.813
Just one.

19:11.217 --> 19:14.285
[traffic noise]

19:22.162 --> 19:22.894
Hey.

19:32.472 --> 19:33.404
What are you doing?

19:38.678 --> 19:40.578
Look, I'm sorry about
last night, okay?

19:40.580 --> 19:42.847
I just, Tanya showed up
and I was going to--

19:42.849 --> 19:44.415
I don't care about Tanya.

19:45.351 --> 19:46.417
-Look--
-Okay.

19:46.419 --> 19:49.453
You acted like you wanted
to talk and just bounced.

19:49.455 --> 19:51.556
-I know, I know.
-You leave tomorrow.

19:53.259 --> 19:54.292
I know.

19:54.294 --> 19:55.226
So what are we doing?

19:57.730 --> 19:58.963
I'm sorry, okay?

19:58.965 --> 20:01.332
It's just
I have a lot on my mind

20:01.334 --> 20:03.701
and like I still have
a shit ton to do

20:03.703 --> 20:05.603
and then my mom just wants
to hang out with me--

20:05.605 --> 20:08.739
That shit is whatever, that
shit doesn't matter, okay?

20:12.645 --> 20:14.245
-Doesn't matter?
-Doesn't matter.

20:16.216 --> 20:17.982
Sure, yeah, totally.

20:18.484 --> 20:20.785
You know, it's whatever, it's
just my fucking life, right?

20:22.655 --> 20:23.854
I don't know if you know this,

20:23.856 --> 20:25.723
but for the past couple of days,

20:25.725 --> 20:30.795
I've just been like
steadily freaking out inside

20:31.364 --> 20:35.967
and, you know, like all I can
think is that I want

20:35.969 --> 20:38.703
to be an engineer,
I want to be an engineer,

20:38.705 --> 20:40.404
-like I want to make things--
-I know.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.740
I know, but do you know
any engineers?

20:44.010 --> 20:44.976
I don't know, no?

20:44.978 --> 20:46.310
I don't fucking know what

20:46.312 --> 20:47.612
an engineer even fucking does.

20:47.614 --> 20:49.413
Fucking exactly right?
So it's like

20:49.415 --> 20:51.916
I sound stupid because
it's what I want to do,

20:51.918 --> 20:53.251
but I don't know how to do it

20:53.253 --> 20:54.385
and then like I start to get

20:54.387 --> 20:55.686
fucking tight and I just like--

20:55.688 --> 20:56.921
Hey, hey, hey.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.522
-I don't--
-Hey, hey, hey.

21:00.393 --> 21:01.325
It's okay, baby.

21:03.496 --> 21:04.428
Stay an extra day with me.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.999
I can't, I can't stay.

21:08.001 --> 21:11.302
I have to go, I have to go
tomorrow, like I have to.

21:11.304 --> 21:12.536
It's just a day.

21:13.973 --> 21:14.905
It's not.

21:20.313 --> 21:21.712
Baby.

21:23.349 --> 21:24.548
Please.

21:26.286 --> 21:29.687
-No, baby I can't though.
-Baby.

21:29.689 --> 21:32.490
-No, no, fuck come on.
-Baby?

21:32.492 --> 21:34.592
-What? I'm-
-What the fuck?

21:34.594 --> 21:37.395
-I'm trying to talk to you.
-Now you want to talk.

21:37.397 --> 21:39.830
-I want to talk, I've been
trying to talk to you.
-Not at the party.

21:39.832 --> 21:42.566
-Fuck.
-What the fuck?

21:42.568 --> 21:46.037
I'm trying to tell you
something important to me
like it's important to me.

21:46.039 --> 21:48.472
-So fucking tell me.
-Okay, all right, fine I will.

21:48.474 --> 21:51.475
I have to go and I have
to be there, right?
And I'm going to be there

21:51.477 --> 21:54.312
-and I'm not going to
have anybody with me.
-So I'm going to come visit you.

21:54.314 --> 21:59.917
No you can't because I need to
be there and I can't
be here and you're here.

22:03.856 --> 22:06.757
What are you trying to say?

22:09.996 --> 22:10.928
Say it.

22:13.599 --> 22:14.965
I want a break.

22:30.116 --> 22:31.515
What the fuck?

22:33.519 --> 22:36.520
[teacher] Okay, last day.

22:38.091 --> 22:39.090
Get your books out.

22:42.995 --> 22:43.928
Next in line.

22:46.699 --> 22:47.965
What can I help you with.

22:49.135 --> 22:50.768
Uh, so I ran out
of birth control.

22:50.770 --> 22:52.870
Oh, what's the last name,
I can get that refilled.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.138
No it's, I need,

22:55.475 --> 22:57.007
the morning after?

22:57.009 --> 22:58.609
We have Plan B One Step.

22:59.512 --> 23:01.679
I need to ask you a
couple of questions,

23:01.681 --> 23:03.047
make sure it's safe for you.

23:05.017 --> 23:07.852
[examiner] You have 90 minutes
to complete the exam.

23:11.691 --> 23:14.725
Wait until I give direction
to turn your packet over.

23:25.471 --> 23:27.705
Turn the fuck around.

23:28.841 --> 23:30.408
Can I go to the bathroom?

23:31.177 --> 23:33.778
What is your normal form
of contraception?

23:33.780 --> 23:35.546
Yaz.

23:35.548 --> 23:38.482
And how many hours since you
last had unprotected sex?

23:38.851 --> 23:41.419
I don't, it was last night.

23:41.421 --> 23:42.887
So like 12 hours?

23:43.089 --> 23:44.989
Uh, yeah, how much is it?

23:45.558 --> 23:47.558

during urination,

23:49.662 --> 23:53.063
-abdominal pain
pain during or after sex?
-No, can I pay?

23:53.533 --> 23:54.832
These questions are
for your safety.

23:55.168 --> 23:56.567
I'm fine, can I pay?

23:57.603 --> 23:59.437
Turn your packet over and begin.

24:25.498 --> 24:27.164
It is 76 dollars.

24:31.537 --> 24:32.303
76.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.070
[pharmacist] Do you want
to use cash or card?

24:35.174 --> 24:37.608
All right, okay, I think
I'm going to just have to,

24:37.610 --> 24:38.676
I'm going to come back.

24:45.751 --> 24:47.017
Shit.

25:20.186 --> 25:21.852
[Mrs. Ellison] Tanya Briggs,

25:21.854 --> 25:23.654
-what do you think you're doing?

25:23.656 --> 25:24.922
We were just going
to the bathroom.

25:24.924 --> 25:26.123
Tanya, you really want detention

25:26.125 --> 25:29.260
-today of all days?
-No.

25:29.262 --> 25:31.061
So, what were you doing?

25:31.998 --> 25:33.531
Okay, she's a fucking ho,
all right?

25:33.533 --> 25:34.765
Tanya, language.

25:34.767 --> 25:37.067
-No, she--
-She pulled my hair.

25:37.069 --> 25:39.270
-No one touched
your ratchet-y ass hair.
-Yes you did.

25:39.272 --> 25:40.871
Oh my God, okay I was
sitting in class

25:40.873 --> 25:41.972
and she fucking starts
turning around

25:41.974 --> 25:42.940
and grilling me and shit.

25:42.942 --> 25:44.275
So what?

25:44.277 --> 25:46.243
So she kicked my chair.

25:46.245 --> 25:48.178
No I didn't, she
kicked my chair.

25:48.180 --> 25:49.680
Stop, just stop.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.117
Is something funny?

25:53.786 --> 25:54.718
No.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.187
Yeah, I didn't think so.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.024
Back to class.

26:00.026 --> 26:01.025
Both of you.

26:03.129 --> 26:04.061
Let's go.

26:09.835 --> 26:11.302
[Lana] Come on.

26:12.038 --> 26:13.070
All right.

26:18.578 --> 26:20.110
[sighs] Damn.

26:27.186 --> 26:28.118
Hey.

26:32.658 --> 26:33.757
What's wrong?

26:33.759 --> 26:34.692
Nothing.

26:35.061 --> 26:37.061
Just get in the car.

26:37.063 --> 26:41.165
Alright,
but look at what I got you.

26:41.167 --> 26:43.767
They didn't have the nasty
cherry ones that you like.

26:44.904 --> 26:46.937
-[Candace] Did you
just pocket these?
-What?

26:46.939 --> 26:49.907
-Did you just pocket these?
-Bitch, I can't hear you.

26:49.909 --> 26:51.875
I said did you just
pocket these?

26:51.877 --> 26:53.344
No, I bought them.

26:57.183 --> 26:58.849
[bell rings]

26:58.851 --> 27:00.718
[Teacher] You can email me
essay corrections.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.119
If you're taking my
class in the fall,

27:02.121 --> 27:04.822
I suggest you do
the corrections.

27:04.824 --> 27:06.290
Enjoy the rest of your summer.

27:15.901 --> 27:17.034
[Lana] I don't think
you should feel bad

27:17.036 --> 27:18.936
just 'cause he crying about it.

27:18.938 --> 27:20.838
He wasn't crying about it.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.673
I'm fucking with you.

27:23.409 --> 27:24.808
I know.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.078
He did cry though.

28:12.258 --> 28:15.059
[intense music]

28:57.503 --> 28:59.103

29:29.101 --> 29:31.235
You're a fucking skank.

30:52.484 --> 30:56.553
[girls talking over each other]

30:57.957 --> 30:59.423
[officer] One at a time.

31:00.860 --> 31:02.092
You, go

31:02.294 --> 31:04.461
Oh, okay.

31:04.463 --> 31:08.131
Well, I was in the parking lot
uhm, with Lana.

31:08.133 --> 31:09.166
[officer] Which one's Lana?

31:11.170 --> 31:13.203
Okay, keep going.

31:14.073 --> 31:16.907
Okay, so yeah, we're by my car

31:16.909 --> 31:19.309
and then we see Willy--

31:19.311 --> 31:21.411

-[officer] Great.

31:21.413 --> 31:25.048
Yeah okay, so we see Willy
and then Tanya--

31:25.050 --> 31:26.583
And Tanya was trying to
kick my ass last night too.

31:26.585 --> 31:29.486
[officer] Let's just stick
to today, okay girls?

31:29.488 --> 31:32.356
Okay yeah, so Tanya
comes out of nowhere

31:32.358 --> 31:34.424
and she just starts
punching her.

31:34.426 --> 31:36.493
-[officer] Punching who?
-Me, she fucking punched me.

31:36.495 --> 31:40.964
[officer] Watch the mouth.
So she's punching her?

31:40.966 --> 31:43.333
-Yeah, she just starts
punching her.
-And she kicked me too.

31:43.335 --> 31:45.636
-Yep, I saw her kick Willy.
-[officer] So now she's

31:45.638 --> 31:48.238
Yeah, and she pulled my hair,

31:48.240 --> 31:54.044
So she's punching and

31:55.114 --> 31:58.415
Ryan comes in and,
uh, she's like.

31:58.417 --> 32:01.251
Ryan tried to stop it, she
jumped in to try to stop it

32:01.253 --> 32:02.920
and then Tanya punched her too.

32:02.922 --> 32:04.621
[officer] So Tanya's
just hitting everybody?

32:04.623 --> 32:07.124
[girls talking over each other]

32:07.126 --> 32:09.626
[officer] Ryan beat
Tanya Briggs pretty bad.

32:11.931 --> 32:12.996
It doesn't matter.

32:14.066 --> 32:15.699
Ryan didn't throw
the first punch.

32:17.937 --> 32:20.270
[arguing in the distance]

32:46.298 --> 32:48.532
Fuck man, Sylvia's going
to fucking kill her.

32:49.134 --> 32:50.334
It ain't my fault.

32:50.336 --> 32:51.301
[Candace] I didn't say it was.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.136
Fuck, that was fucked.

32:53.138 --> 32:54.538
[Candace] I know, did
you see the pee?

32:54.540 --> 32:56.673
It was like she was
fucking dead man.

32:58.410 --> 33:00.210
Oh, I got your money.

33:00.212 --> 33:03.046
The lady asked a bunch
of fucking questions too.

33:03.048 --> 33:04.047
Like what?

33:04.049 --> 33:05.248
Shit, I don't remember.

33:05.250 --> 33:07.017
Fucking Cory.

33:07.019 --> 33:08.485
[Willy] You told her?

33:08.487 --> 33:12.756
-How short are you?
-50 bucks.

33:12.758 --> 33:17.394
-51 bucks and why don't
you just ask Cory for it?
-[Willy] No.

33:22.167 --> 33:23.133
Okay let's go.

33:48.060 --> 33:50.660
Fuck! Stop mom.

33:51.296 --> 33:54.064
[Sylvia] I swear to God,
I swear to God.

34:01.273 --> 34:03.073
They're going to sue me.

34:04.243 --> 34:07.344
They're not coming after you,
you're a child.

34:08.280 --> 34:11.148
They're coming after me, did
you even think about that?

34:11.517 --> 34:14.317
I am not losing everything
because of you.

34:14.319 --> 34:16.486
I'm not losing my apartment.

34:25.264 --> 34:26.696
I want you out.

34:26.698 --> 34:29.232
I want you gone,
I want you to leave.

34:30.469 --> 34:34.371
I will go down to
the courthouse,

34:34.373 --> 34:37.240
and I will get the papers,
and I will talk to a judge.

34:46.485 --> 34:48.752
[laughing]

35:14.446 --> 35:16.680
[Candace] Okay, okay,
come on let's go.

35:16.682 --> 35:18.415
Cory's not even home.

35:18.417 --> 35:21.351
I promise you he's home,
we're getting your 50 bucks.

35:21.353 --> 35:22.853
51 bucks.

35:22.855 --> 35:25.589
It's fine, I don't need
the fucking money.

35:25.591 --> 35:26.857
What do you mean, no,
no, no, no, no.

35:26.859 --> 35:28.859
He busted in you,
he can pay for it.

35:28.861 --> 35:30.327
Exactly.

35:30.329 --> 35:31.428
What all of a sudden you two are

35:31.430 --> 35:32.796
a couple of fucking feminists?

35:32.798 --> 35:35.532
Excuse me, you know it's
the right thing.

35:35.534 --> 35:36.867
Are you doing it or am I?

35:41.140 --> 35:44.541
-[Candace] Double time
boo-boo, let's go.
-[Lana] Love you.

36:02.694 --> 36:04.895
-Hey.
-Hey, Cory.

36:04.897 --> 36:06.663
What's going on?

36:06.665 --> 36:10.534
Uh, not much, Ryan just beat
the shit out of Tanya.

36:10.536 --> 36:11.635
-Oh.
-Yeah.

36:12.437 --> 36:15.305
-[chuckles nervously]
-[Cory] Okay.

36:16.875 --> 36:19.276
You going to
the kickback tonight?

36:19.278 --> 36:20.744
For sure, yeah, yeah.

36:20.746 --> 36:23.613
Okay, you know if you
want a ride or something,

36:23.615 --> 36:25.649
bro's going to let me
borrow his truck.

36:25.651 --> 36:29.619
-Okay, yeah, I just wanted
to ask--
-I can pick you up you know,

36:29.621 --> 36:33.723
or he's going to get some beers
and some hard A too, you know.

36:33.725 --> 36:34.658
Cool.

36:34.660 --> 36:39.963
Uh... Hey, I was
just wondering if you...

36:39.965 --> 36:41.298
What's up?

36:41.300 --> 36:43.300
-I, uhm...
-Everything okay?

36:43.302 --> 36:44.234
Yeah.

36:44.236 --> 36:46.336
Uh, no.

36:46.338 --> 36:50.540
I, uh--
It's just that did you--

36:50.542 --> 36:55.679
uhm, did you come inside me
last night?

36:56.682 --> 36:57.614
[Cory] What?

36:59.418 --> 37:01.952
[Willy] It's not
a big deal, I just--

37:01.954 --> 37:07.691
I don't really remember
and uhm, yeah, so...

37:08.560 --> 37:12.462
Yeah, I mean, I think, maybe.

37:13.498 --> 37:15.398
I didn't have a condom so.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.499
No, I know.

37:17.836 --> 37:19.336
Uhm, are you on birth control
or anything?

37:19.338 --> 37:22.505
Not really, I mean, no.

37:23.575 --> 37:25.742
But I was going to
get the Plan B.

37:25.744 --> 37:27.644
Yeah, yeah, that's great.

37:27.646 --> 37:33.416
Yeah, yeah it is, but I don't
exactly have the cash, so...

37:33.952 --> 37:35.318
How much do you need?

37:35.320 --> 37:41.324
I just need like 50 bucks, or
51, 51 would be awesome, so.

37:41.326 --> 37:44.561
Yeah, I don't--
I don't think I have that.

37:44.730 --> 37:47.831
Okay, no, I just
wanted to check.

37:47.833 --> 37:50.400
Sorry, I think I've got
like you know, 10 on me.

37:50.402 --> 37:51.968
[Willy] It's okay.

37:51.970 --> 37:55.805
-Hold on, one second.
-Okay, uhm... Jesus.

38:03.749 --> 38:05.315
Here.

38:06.518 --> 38:10.587
No, this is great, thank you.

38:10.589 --> 38:11.921
[Cory] Sorry.

38:11.923 --> 38:14.357
It's okay, thank you, really.

38:14.359 --> 38:17.627
But I will see you tonight.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.429
For sure, yeah.

38:20.899 --> 38:22.465
-Bye.
-Bye.

38:22.901 --> 38:23.833
Bye!

38:29.541 --> 38:31.341
What did he say?

38:31.343 --> 38:33.777
-He said sorry.
-And?

38:33.779 --> 38:35.912
He gave me 10 bucks.

38:35.914 --> 38:38.081
-Ten bucks?
-Fuck that.

38:38.083 --> 38:39.082
No, no.

38:40.452 --> 38:42.052
Can we just go now, it's fine.

38:42.054 --> 38:43.586
What do you mean?

38:43.588 --> 38:44.988
I mean he said he's broke.

38:45.891 --> 38:50.493
Oh he said he's--
did he say he was broke?

38:50.495 --> 38:53.663
He lives in the fucking Heights,
they all got money here.

38:53.665 --> 38:55.932
Just let it fucking go,
let's go.

38:57.736 --> 38:59.369
-Nope.
-Lana, what are you doing?

38:59.371 --> 39:01.538
-Get him, Lana.
-Lana, don't.

39:11.483 --> 39:13.083
[Cory's mom] Hello?

39:13.085 --> 39:16.753
-Is Cory home?
-[Cory's mom] No.

39:16.755 --> 39:20.357
-Okay, thank you.
-No, no, no, no.

39:20.759 --> 39:22.459
[Cory's mom] Do you
want to leave a message?

39:22.461 --> 39:23.993
-No.
-Yes.

39:24.963 --> 39:26.796
Could you tell him he should
wear a condom

39:26.798 --> 39:28.665
the next time he decides to
come inside a drunk girl?

39:29.401 --> 39:30.834
What did you say?

39:30.836 --> 39:33.436
You know what, thank you
so much for your time.

39:33.438 --> 39:36.406
-Have a great day, bye!
-Lovely fucking day.

39:36.408 --> 39:38.608
-Let's go, let's go, let's go.
-[overlapping talk]

39:49.087 --> 39:51.988
I got to go to work,
you can walk from here.

40:33.432 --> 40:37.667
OK, relax, it's never fucking
mattered before.

40:37.669 --> 40:39.035
You didn't have to do that.

40:39.037 --> 40:40.703
[Candace] Oh chill out,

40:40.705 --> 40:42.705
little Cory will talk
his way out of that shit.

40:42.707 --> 40:44.073
Seriously.

40:44.075 --> 40:46.142
Okay, whose got this?

40:48.079 --> 40:49.145
I'm broke.

40:51.483 --> 40:52.482
I got this shit.

41:17.642 --> 41:21.578
Fuck, dude, this is stupid,
I fucking told you.

41:21.580 --> 41:23.112
I said we shouldn't
shoulder tap in the Heights,

41:23.114 --> 41:24.113
we got a meter running.

41:24.115 --> 41:25.482
[Candace] Go ahead then.

41:25.484 --> 41:26.983
I did it last night.

41:26.985 --> 41:29.185
[Willy] I'm not allowed
in there, so I'm out.

41:29.187 --> 41:30.854
It's got to be you, honey.

41:30.856 --> 41:33.823
-[Willy] Come on, Cherry.
-No, no I'm doing it.

41:33.825 --> 41:37.060
Come on. Yeah, come on, this is
our last night together.

41:37.062 --> 41:39.562
[Candace] No, because
I have never stolen

41:39.564 --> 41:41.965
anything in my life and I'm
not going to start that now.

41:41.967 --> 41:44.667
-That's exactly why you
should be the one to do it.
-No, no I'm not.

41:44.669 --> 41:46.069
You're leaving here
tomorrow, so.

41:46.071 --> 41:48.004
Exactly, it doesn't
even matter for you.

41:48.006 --> 41:49.939
[Candace] It does matter to me,
it's important to me.

41:49.941 --> 41:51.808
I'm not going to do it, I
would do anything for you guys

41:51.810 --> 41:53.743
I'm just not going
to steal for you.

41:53.745 --> 41:56.513
If you love us
then you'll do it.

41:57.649 --> 42:00.850
[building drum music]

42:37.589 --> 42:39.989
Shit, it's taking too long.

43:07.252 --> 43:08.718
No, no, stop.

43:44.889 --> 43:46.356
You okay?

43:47.792 --> 43:48.992
Yeah.

43:49.828 --> 43:51.094
Yeah, just.

43:53.164 --> 43:54.831
Did you get in a fight?

43:56.901 --> 43:59.402
-Yeah.
-Did you win?

44:02.207 --> 44:03.139
Let me see.

44:05.644 --> 44:06.676
What?

44:07.145 --> 44:09.679
Your hand, let me see your hand.

44:09.681 --> 44:10.413
Come over here.

44:18.023 --> 44:20.156
Let's see what kind of
damage you did here, bruiser.

44:24.029 --> 44:24.961
That hurt?

44:25.830 --> 44:28.331
-Yeah.
-I bet.

44:30.035 --> 44:31.701
All right, hang tight.

44:46.384 --> 44:50.920
Frozen peas, does the trick
every time.

45:23.054 --> 45:24.821
You know what,
I got to be honest,

45:24.823 --> 45:27.156
I don't know if I'm doing
the right thing here. [chuckles]

45:27.158 --> 45:28.257
I hope this is right.

45:30.495 --> 45:31.728
Seems right, right?

45:33.832 --> 45:35.298
You have that job interview?

45:39.037 --> 45:39.969
Yeah.

45:41.773 --> 45:42.805
Tie and everything.

45:44.309 --> 45:45.341
What was it for?

45:47.112 --> 45:50.379
Don't matter, I didn't want it.

46:17.308 --> 46:20.376
[suspenseful music]

47:12.430 --> 47:14.030
Shit, shit.

47:17.368 --> 47:21.437
She's a fucking child,
she's a god damn child.

47:21.439 --> 47:24.407
Get out, get out!

47:24.409 --> 47:26.342
She's a child.

47:26.611 --> 47:28.477
She's a child.

47:28.479 --> 47:30.313
Oh my God, she's just a child.

48:13.057 --> 48:15.424
[Lana] So what you going to do?

48:16.427 --> 48:19.595
I don't know, I'm probably
not even pregnant.

48:21.199 --> 48:22.265
Probably not.

48:23.635 --> 48:26.469
Cory's probably got
fucking retarded sperm.

48:26.938 --> 48:29.405
Yeah, they probably got
fucking lost or something.

48:29.407 --> 48:30.973
They just bounced around
in your pussy

48:30.975 --> 48:32.041
and fucking gave up.

48:37.482 --> 48:41.517
I swear, I don't even
remember that shit.

48:41.519 --> 48:43.686
You should have made
him pay, he got money.

48:44.923 --> 48:46.122
Don't matter.

48:46.124 --> 48:47.623
It does if you end up pregnant

48:47.625 --> 48:49.492
with a fucking retarded
Cory baby.

48:49.494 --> 48:52.061
Fuck that, I'd rather
fucking kill myself.

48:55.199 --> 48:56.399
All right, you ready?

49:00.438 --> 49:03.139
Fuck, I have no aim.

49:04.208 --> 49:08.277
-Okay...
-Okay. Last try.

49:09.447 --> 49:12.214
Ready, one, two, three.

49:13.184 --> 49:16.585
-Heck, yeah!
-Wait, what are you celebrating?
I hit it.

49:16.587 --> 49:18.487
Fuck you, I fucking hit that.

49:18.489 --> 49:20.690
Fuck you, bitch.

49:20.692 --> 49:24.093
-Come here, I fucking hit it.
-Oh yeah, what now, huh?

49:24.095 --> 49:25.428
Fuck you, I hit it.

49:25.430 --> 49:27.096
No, who really hit that?

49:27.098 --> 49:29.365
Stop, Lana stop.

49:30.468 --> 49:32.368
-Who hit the bottle?
-You're hurting me.

49:48.086 --> 49:49.251
Are you a dyke?

49:50.488 --> 49:52.054
What?

49:52.423 --> 49:55.057
-Lana, what the fuck was that?
-Nothing.

49:55.326 --> 49:57.593
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Nothing.

50:00.131 --> 50:03.132
-What the fuck were
you just doing?
-Nothing.

50:04.736 --> 50:06.302
[Willy] Just take me home.

50:11.642 --> 50:12.575
Fuck.

51:18.476 --> 51:19.708
[Candace] Ryan.

51:22.747 --> 51:24.080
Ryan.

51:25.316 --> 51:26.715
Ryan.

51:34.192 --> 51:35.658
Hey.

51:35.659 --> 51:37.125
You forgot your backpack,
you want to go?

51:58.282 --> 52:01.484
Shit man, I still can't believe
this is actually happening.

52:02.854 --> 52:03.886
Well, it is.

52:04.856 --> 52:05.855
I know.

52:07.391 --> 52:08.557
Do you want to wear this?

52:10.161 --> 52:10.893
Sure.

52:17.535 --> 52:21.370
So, do you want to talk
about what happened?

52:22.540 --> 52:23.472
Nothing.

52:27.512 --> 52:30.312
Dude, you like clobbered the
fuck out of Tanya's face,

52:30.314 --> 52:33.716
like, God you punched her
so fucking hard

52:33.718 --> 52:35.584
she peed on herself,
like I was standing

52:35.586 --> 52:37.419
all the way at my car
and then I saw--

52:37.421 --> 52:40.356
I didn't pass that test
anyway, so fuck it.

52:40.358 --> 52:41.724
I don't want to talk about it.

52:43.761 --> 52:45.895
Did you get the score already?

52:45.897 --> 52:46.862
No.

52:48.366 --> 52:49.732
So how do you know?

52:56.941 --> 52:57.907
Okay, okay.

52:59.644 --> 53:01.577
We don't have to talk about it.

53:03.648 --> 53:05.948
Do you want to know
what I did today?

53:07.552 --> 53:08.985
What?

53:08.986 --> 53:10.419
-I just stole two cases of beer.
-What?

53:11.422 --> 53:13.589
I stole two cases of beer,
like I walked right in,

53:13.591 --> 53:17.560
I grabbed two cases, I ran past
the guy who worked there

53:17.562 --> 53:18.861
and I jumped in the car and then

53:18.863 --> 53:20.496
Lana just drove fucking off.

53:27.905 --> 53:28.837
Okay.

53:32.543 --> 53:34.343
So then, what's going on?

53:34.345 --> 53:35.444
Nothing, Cherry.

53:38.316 --> 53:39.815
[Candace] I don't believe you.

53:40.751 --> 53:42.351
Okay, well...

53:42.353 --> 53:43.986
-Dude, fuck off.
-You fuck off.

53:43.988 --> 53:46.689
-No, tell me, talk to me.
-Cherry, he fucked me.

53:48.492 --> 53:50.526
-What?
-Okay, Cherry, fuck.

53:52.263 --> 53:53.929
I did it.

53:53.931 --> 53:55.864
What do you mean,
what did you do?

53:57.301 --> 53:58.534
She kicked me out.

53:59.370 --> 54:02.771
She said I had to leave,
I had to get emancipated

54:02.773 --> 54:03.706
or some shit.

54:03.708 --> 54:05.908
Who your mom-- your mom?

54:05.910 --> 54:07.943
And I went home.

54:08.579 --> 54:09.745
[Candace] Okay.

54:10.948 --> 54:12.715
And Jason was there.

54:16.854 --> 54:21.724
He helped me with my hand and,
and then he was on--

54:22.793 --> 54:25.294
I don't fucking know I
was just fucking numb.

54:25.296 --> 54:28.864
And then his pants were down
and I'm on the couch and--

54:33.604 --> 54:37.606
I couldn't-- I didn't
fucking know, I was--

54:42.580 --> 54:44.613
And then she came in and saw us.

54:49.020 --> 54:50.653
It's not like they were
going to get married

54:50.655 --> 54:52.755
or anything either,
he's a guy, you know?

54:53.624 --> 54:55.691
He's just another fucking guy.

55:00.731 --> 55:04.733
Are you...
I mean, are you okay?

55:14.845 --> 55:16.779
I want to do something.

55:17.815 --> 55:19.982
-Cherry.
-No listen.

55:21.052 --> 55:23.319
I have an idea, I want
to do something, okay?

55:23.321 --> 55:25.087
-Before we go to this party.
-Cherry, I don't--

55:25.089 --> 55:26.922
-Listen, no, no, listen, listen.
-I'm really not,

55:26.924 --> 55:30.092
-I don't feel like
even leaving now.
-I hear you.

55:32.430 --> 55:34.530
I hear you, I just wanted--

55:34.965 --> 55:36.632
-Fine.
-Okay.

55:37.001 --> 55:39.034
Okay, just trust me on this.

55:40.071 --> 55:41.437
Grab that fucking hat.

55:55.019 --> 55:56.352
Just follow me, okay?

55:58.022 --> 55:58.987
I'm taking this.

56:15.373 --> 56:16.472
-Cherry.
-Shut up.

56:22.847 --> 56:24.613
Just trust me, okay.

56:25.716 --> 56:26.815
You're going to like it.

56:29.754 --> 56:31.687
Okay, come on.

56:36.727 --> 56:38.627
[Ryan] What are we doing?

56:38.629 --> 56:39.962
Just, hold on.

56:43.401 --> 56:46.802
-Okay, stay here.
-Why?

56:46.804 --> 56:50.639
Just stand here and put this on.

56:51.609 --> 56:52.941
Just put it on.

57:02.953 --> 57:03.886
Okay.

57:19.770 --> 57:21.069
Dear admissions committee,

57:22.807 --> 57:25.741
as a counselor at a low
income magnet school

57:25.743 --> 57:28.043
at a dilapidated fourth
plane district

57:28.045 --> 57:30.045
of Vancouver, Washington,

57:30.047 --> 57:33.115
I have seen my fair share
of troubled students.

57:34.118 --> 57:37.953
Children plunging head first
down disastrous paths

57:37.955 --> 57:40.155
despite my best efforts
to steer them

57:40.157 --> 57:43.525
toward a future that
involves steady employment,

57:43.527 --> 57:48.096
a craft or trade in some
cases, maybe even college.

57:49.500 --> 57:53.535
I found Ryan Reese amongst
predictably bleak circumstances.

57:53.537 --> 57:54.803
-Cherry, don't--
-Let me just--

57:56.173 --> 57:58.507
Let me just read this, okay?

58:01.679 --> 58:05.113
If we were judged by the
worst things we had done,

58:05.115 --> 58:08.183
then we would be probably
all be considered bad people.

58:09.887 --> 58:13.255
If you looked at Ryan's
transcript or,

58:13.257 --> 58:14.656
she's says rap sheet,

58:15.793 --> 58:18.861
then you might be inclined
to dismiss her.

58:18.863 --> 58:21.263
Another person in a long list

58:21.265 --> 58:24.533
that has attempted to
exclude this young woman

58:24.535 --> 58:27.002
from one of her many
quiet goals.

58:28.539 --> 58:31.006
What you don't see
in that transcript

58:31.008 --> 58:33.208
is a vulnerable young woman.

58:34.011 --> 58:37.112
Vulnerable to the demands of
a single parent household.

58:38.215 --> 58:41.617
Vulnerable to
the psychological distress

58:41.619 --> 58:45.954
that accompanies a black eye
and she has had many.

58:48.859 --> 58:51.260
Vulnerable to a school district

58:51.262 --> 58:53.128
that offers a fraction
of the tools

58:53.130 --> 58:55.163
that a student who
is blessed enough

58:55.165 --> 58:58.066
to live just
five miles east has.

58:58.068 --> 59:02.738
She is vulnerable,
not because she is weak.

59:02.740 --> 59:05.707
Her vulnerability
is her strength.

59:07.044 --> 59:09.144
Despite the obstacles
stacked against her,

59:09.146 --> 59:12.214
she arrives at the front doors
of East Vancouver High

59:12.216 --> 59:14.683
and she fights for herself.

59:14.685 --> 59:16.718
She fights for something better.

59:18.656 --> 59:19.588
So...

59:21.225 --> 59:23.926
While many students will
arrive unbridled

59:23.928 --> 59:26.295
to your university,
anxious to partake

59:26.297 --> 59:28.830
in the celebration to
discover one's self,

59:28.832 --> 59:33.101
this woman will be
striving for a better life.

59:34.805 --> 59:37.573
And what could possibly be
more honorable than that?

59:38.742 --> 59:41.076
I write this as
a proud faculty member,

59:41.078 --> 59:43.312
reminding myself that
she is the reason

59:43.314 --> 59:46.114
that I come to school each day.

59:46.116 --> 59:52.254
She gives me a better life,
more fulfilled life.

59:54.058 --> 59:57.125
And I know that she can do
that for your college also.

59:57.127 --> 59:59.361
Sincerely, Doctor Ellison.

1:00:11.241 --> 1:00:16.845
[chuckles] Ryan Reese, please
come accept your diploma.

1:00:26.657 --> 1:00:29.057
-I love you.
-I love you.

1:00:30.394 --> 1:00:33.328
Now do you want to go to
this shit hole party, or?

1:00:34.798 --> 1:00:37.065
-Yeah.
-[both laughs]

[party music blaring]

1:01:32.322 --> 1:01:33.755
-Cory!
-[indistinct chatter]

1:01:46.270 --> 1:01:50.806
Dude, you fucked that bitch up.
I couldn't fucking believe it.

1:01:50.808 --> 1:01:53.375
She's like crying and like
pissing all over herself.

1:01:53.377 --> 1:01:55.277
It wasn't like that.

1:01:55.279 --> 1:01:58.146
Bull fucking shit, Ryan,
I saw that.

1:01:58.148 --> 1:02:00.415
Hey, hey are you with Lana?

1:02:00.417 --> 1:02:02.050
Sure.

1:02:02.052 --> 1:02:04.086
Wait, I thought that
she brought you here.

1:02:04.088 --> 1:02:07.823
Let's just take shots,
come, come, come. [indistinct]

1:02:07.825 --> 1:02:10.826
[car horn honking]

1:02:24.942 --> 1:02:27.909
-Oh my God, do you want this?
-I don't want it.

1:02:33.350 --> 1:02:35.083
God, fuck.

1:02:35.085 --> 1:02:36.351
-What?
-My mom.

1:02:37.121 --> 1:02:38.253
You want to go?

1:02:38.255 --> 1:02:40.856
No just, I'll be back.

1:04:00.137 --> 1:04:01.336
Hey.

1:04:02.105 --> 1:04:03.238
Hey.

1:04:41.345 --> 1:04:45.213
-Hey, uhm, do you have
that lipstick?
-Oh yeah.

1:04:46.149 --> 1:04:50.952
-You good?
-Yeah, can I leave?

1:04:50.954 --> 1:04:52.320
Yeah.

1:04:52.322 --> 1:04:54.456
Okay, I'm going
to go in the morning.

1:04:54.458 --> 1:04:55.423
What time.

1:04:55.425 --> 1:04:57.092
Like eight.

1:04:57.094 --> 1:04:59.427
Okay, have fun.

1:05:12.075 --> 1:05:14.109
Oh my God.

1:05:19.116 --> 1:05:21.616
-You good?
-Mhm.

1:05:25.222 --> 1:05:27.956
-Yeah, I heard something.
-[Ryan] What?

1:05:29.493 --> 1:05:32.560
I heard you kicked
the shit out of Tanya.

1:05:35.699 --> 1:05:39.034
Yeah, you know she used to be
friends with my older sister,
right?

1:05:39.036 --> 1:05:41.603
I remember when I was like 12,

1:05:41.605 --> 1:05:44.172
she came into my room
while I was sleeping

1:05:44.174 --> 1:05:49.577
-and just like started pulling
my hair like a psycho.
-What the fuck?

1:05:49.579 --> 1:05:52.981
Yeah, I mean she could
probably beat my ass, so

1:05:54.384 --> 1:05:55.517
I'm glad you did it.

1:05:58.255 --> 1:05:59.621
You get in trouble?

1:06:00.624 --> 1:06:01.690
Yeah.

1:06:01.692 --> 1:06:03.625
Fuck.

1:06:05.595 --> 1:06:07.329
So what about college?

1:06:12.235 --> 1:06:13.168
I don't know.

1:06:14.004 --> 1:06:16.071
Well, I guess you don't have to.

1:06:16.073 --> 1:06:17.072
My brother didn't.

1:06:17.074 --> 1:06:19.607
He didn't know what he
really wanted to do

1:06:19.609 --> 1:06:21.543
so he just joined the army.

1:06:21.545 --> 1:06:23.345
Said the army was full of people

1:06:23.347 --> 1:06:25.347
who didn't know what
they wanted to do.

1:06:25.349 --> 1:06:27.415
Just a bunch of like
dipshits and stuff.

1:06:27.584 --> 1:06:29.751
Well, I don't want
to go in the army.

1:06:29.753 --> 1:06:32.153
Nah, that's not what I'm saying.

1:06:33.690 --> 1:06:35.457
It's all right.

1:06:35.459 --> 1:06:37.659
You know I probably should
go in the fucking army.

1:06:39.529 --> 1:06:40.462
I don't know.

1:06:42.733 --> 1:06:46.434
I thought about doing like
hairdressing school or
something.

1:06:48.171 --> 1:06:50.472
I just think it would be
better than working at a

1:06:51.608 --> 1:06:53.308
Wendy's or something.

1:06:55.645 --> 1:06:57.512
I'm keeping it a secret though.

1:06:57.514 --> 1:06:58.446
Why?

1:07:01.752 --> 1:07:03.284
Because it's just for me.

1:07:05.622 --> 1:07:06.554
Okay.

1:07:08.792 --> 1:07:11.126
So you got secrets now.

1:07:15.732 --> 1:07:17.332
I'll tell you another one.

1:07:19.636 --> 1:07:20.568
All right.

1:07:22.506 --> 1:07:24.039
I've never kissed anyone.

1:07:24.808 --> 1:07:25.740
What?

1:07:25.742 --> 1:07:29.377
I mean I've never just
kissed someone, like

1:07:30.213 --> 1:07:31.146
just a kiss.

1:07:33.050 --> 1:07:35.583
[techno music]

1:08:20.831 --> 1:08:24.099
Hey Willy, it's me, I'm just

1:08:25.235 --> 1:08:27.769
trying to figure out
where you are, so

1:08:27.771 --> 1:08:30.238
give me a call back, okay?

1:08:35.745 --> 1:08:38.279
[Willy] What are you doing?

1:08:40.283 --> 1:08:42.817
It's okay, yeah, you're sexy.

1:08:46.123 --> 1:08:47.856
-Shh...
-You're a freak dude.

1:08:51.528 --> 1:08:53.795
What did you do,
what did you do?

1:08:53.797 --> 1:08:57.365
-[chuckles]
-No.

1:08:57.367 --> 1:09:01.536
I just want to see, just
a second, just a second.

1:09:01.538 --> 1:09:03.705
No, no, no way.

1:09:03.707 --> 1:09:08.176
So, I think maybe these need
to come off a little bit.

1:09:35.305 --> 1:09:36.838
-Wait.
-What?

1:09:39.543 --> 1:09:43.878
You said you wanted to break up,
you said you want to move on
and go do other things or.

1:09:43.880 --> 1:09:48.816
Yeah. But I want to.

1:09:59.896 --> 1:10:01.796
I'm going to put it
on for you, okay?

1:10:29.993 --> 1:10:32.360
Well like, I got to
get going anyway.

1:10:32.362 --> 1:10:34.729
My mom gave me a curfew.

1:10:35.599 --> 1:10:37.298
She's over at that
Olive Garden on Milplane.

1:10:37.300 --> 1:10:39.234
Wait, seriously?

1:10:39.236 --> 1:10:40.802
-Yeah.
-I fucking love that place.

1:10:40.804 --> 1:10:42.470
I went there for
Homecoming once,

1:10:42.472 --> 1:10:45.540
I swear I had like 30
of those breadsticks.

1:10:45.542 --> 1:10:47.575
Yeah, I always make
her bring me those.

1:10:47.577 --> 1:10:49.410
-So good.
-And the Chicken Alfredo.

1:10:53.583 --> 1:10:55.516
I can walk with you.

1:10:56.353 --> 1:10:57.752
Unless you don't want me to.

1:10:58.588 --> 1:11:00.555
[Benny] Nah, it's cool.

1:11:00.557 --> 1:11:02.957
I'm just letting you know
though it's like two miles away.

1:11:04.461 --> 1:11:05.460
You going to be good?

1:11:06.696 --> 1:11:08.563
-I think so.
-You sure?

1:11:08.565 --> 1:11:09.864
Yeah.

1:11:49.939 --> 1:11:52.407
Hey, have you seen Willy?

1:12:05.622 --> 1:12:07.755
Get up, come on.

1:12:07.757 --> 1:12:08.690
Get up.

1:12:11.861 --> 1:12:13.328
What the fuck?

1:12:13.730 --> 1:12:15.496
-Shit!
-Yo bitch.

1:12:15.498 --> 1:12:17.632
Don't fucking touch me.

1:12:19.803 --> 1:12:20.735
Lana?

1:12:22.539 --> 1:12:24.939
Hey, lift your hips up
for me, okay?

1:12:24.941 --> 1:12:26.974
-I'm sorry.
-No, no, no I'm sorry.

1:12:30.714 --> 1:12:33.047
Lana, relax we weren't
doing anything.

1:12:37.987 --> 1:12:39.120
Lana, Lana.

1:12:39.122 --> 1:12:40.054
Fuck you.

1:12:41.891 --> 1:12:44.525
Almost there, almost
there, step.

1:12:45.729 --> 1:12:47.462
Good, step.

1:12:47.464 --> 1:12:48.429
Step, step.

1:12:49.032 --> 1:12:51.032
Good, good, good, good, okay.

1:12:53.536 --> 1:12:56.471
It's okay, we're
going home, okay?

1:12:57.107 --> 1:12:58.539
Okay, head down.

1:13:11.521 --> 1:13:13.020
-[scream]
-[thud]

1:13:21.664 --> 1:13:23.531
Here we go.

1:13:27.537 --> 1:13:28.936
This is nice.

1:13:29.906 --> 1:13:33.174
Yeah, my mom does
commercial real estate actually.

1:13:39.849 --> 1:13:42.850
So I'm gonna... go.

1:13:42.852 --> 1:13:44.018
Where you going to go?

1:13:47.590 --> 1:13:49.057
I don't know.

1:13:49.058 --> 1:13:50.525
Like, you're just
going to roam the streets, or?

1:13:50.527 --> 1:13:54.162
No, stupid I'm not just
going to roam the streets.

1:13:54.164 --> 1:13:55.096
I'm going to...

1:13:57.934 --> 1:14:00.468
-I don't know just--
-'Cause look, my mom's inside

1:14:00.470 --> 1:14:02.904
-and I can sneak you in right
here through the side door.
-That's okay.

1:14:02.906 --> 1:14:05.940
Look, just give me like one
minute. Just go right here,
and I can sneak you in.

1:14:05.942 --> 1:14:10.611
-Benny.
-Look, just give me one
minute, one minute.

1:15:16.880 --> 1:15:18.713
She doesn't come in here?

1:15:25.822 --> 1:15:26.754
I love you.

1:15:32.095 --> 1:15:34.028
You don't have to say
it back, I just--

1:15:36.132 --> 1:15:37.198
I want you to know.

1:15:41.971 --> 1:15:42.904
But,

1:15:44.641 --> 1:15:46.040
you don't.

1:15:46.042 --> 1:15:47.108
-I do.
-No.

1:15:50.046 --> 1:15:50.978
You're leaving.

1:15:52.916 --> 1:15:54.882
Well yeah, 'cause
I can't stay here.

1:15:57.887 --> 1:15:59.954
You know, I tried to
take the GED test?

1:16:03.893 --> 1:16:05.192
Shit is just not for me.

1:16:08.231 --> 1:16:09.931
[Candace] I know.

1:16:12.268 --> 1:16:13.601
Doesn't matter.

1:16:14.070 --> 1:16:15.836
You could always take it again.

1:16:17.707 --> 1:16:19.040
I'm not going to.

1:16:25.348 --> 1:16:26.847
Can I sleep here tonight?

1:16:29.118 --> 1:16:30.051
Yeah.

1:16:36.626 --> 1:16:39.827
Okay, just sit here.

1:16:41.731 --> 1:16:43.998
-I'm thirsty.
-Okay, I'll be right back.

1:16:58.381 --> 1:16:59.313
Okay.

1:17:06.823 --> 1:17:09.090
Here, take this.

1:17:09.092 --> 1:17:10.024
Okay.

1:17:13.029 --> 1:17:14.128
Face up.

1:17:19.302 --> 1:17:20.234
You good?

1:17:41.724 --> 1:17:44.191
Come sleep up here with me.

1:17:47.897 --> 1:17:48.829
Lana?

1:18:19.996 --> 1:18:21.929
Are you sure your mom
never comes in here?

1:18:22.365 --> 1:18:23.831
Nah, she always knocks
if she does.

1:18:26.436 --> 1:18:29.904
So does she like wear
suits to work, or what?

1:18:29.906 --> 1:18:30.905
My mom?

1:18:30.907 --> 1:18:31.839
Yeah.

1:18:33.209 --> 1:18:35.943
Sometimes, why?

1:18:37.447 --> 1:18:38.913
I don't know.

1:18:44.387 --> 1:18:46.187
You know, you can sleep
on my bed if you want,

1:18:46.189 --> 1:18:47.321
I don't care.

1:18:49.859 --> 1:18:51.425
Where will you sleep?

1:18:51.427 --> 1:18:52.860
Yo, right on the floor.

1:18:52.862 --> 1:18:54.228
I got a sleeping bag.

1:18:56.232 --> 1:18:57.932
See?

1:18:57.934 --> 1:18:58.866
Right.

1:19:06.342 --> 1:19:10.377
Damn, this shit is comfortable.

1:19:18.254 --> 1:19:20.287
Hey, would you mind

1:19:20.289 --> 1:19:22.089
throwing me like a pillow
or something?

1:19:22.992 --> 1:19:24.458
[laughinhg]

1:19:24.460 --> 1:19:25.793
Thanks.

1:19:32.335 --> 1:19:34.435
So did you have
Mrs. Lane for English?

1:19:34.437 --> 1:19:37.204
For like a minute.
But I had to switch out though,

1:19:37.206 --> 1:19:40.107
-I kept falling asleep
in her class.
-Yeah, me too.

1:19:40.109 --> 1:19:42.843
Honestly, I could
fall asleep anywhere.

1:19:48.818 --> 1:19:49.550
Benny?

1:19:52.488 --> 1:19:53.988
Will you give me a kiss?

1:19:56.092 --> 1:19:57.024
Yeah.

1:20:41.037 --> 1:20:47.508
[dramatic ambient music]

1:21:41.330 --> 1:21:45.232
[percussive electronic music]

1:22:03.286 --> 1:22:07.087
-[Ryan] Look what I got you.
-My god!

1:22:07.089 --> 1:22:08.689
What did you bring me?

1:22:08.691 --> 1:22:11.492
-Oh, shit, like that?
-[chuckles]

1:22:11.494 --> 1:22:14.395
-Dude, what the fuck.
-[chuckles]

1:22:14.397 --> 1:22:16.297
Why would you not get a bag?

1:22:16.299 --> 1:22:18.265
-This was more fun.
-I don't know.

1:22:18.267 --> 1:22:20.034
Okay, give me one second.

1:22:22.171 --> 1:22:24.939
You know whose asshole moved
to make us get up
this early, right?

1:22:24.941 --> 1:22:26.206
Yes, I do.

1:22:28.644 --> 1:22:29.576
Are you okay?

1:22:30.212 --> 1:22:32.546
-I puked.
-Oh, yeah?

1:22:34.183 --> 1:22:35.516
Everything go good
last night?

1:22:36.686 --> 1:22:39.987
Uhm... Yeah, it went good.

1:22:40.389 --> 1:22:41.722
Uh...

1:22:45.661 --> 1:22:47.661
Guys, I-- I gotta go.

1:22:50.166 --> 1:22:52.032
Well, okay.

1:23:02.178 --> 1:23:03.444
I love you, guys.

1:23:03.446 --> 1:23:05.312
-I love you.
-I love you.

1:23:16.492 --> 1:23:18.258
Hey, uhm...

1:23:18.995 --> 1:23:20.594
-Please.
-I'm fine.

1:23:20.596 --> 1:23:21.562
Okay.

1:23:22.999 --> 1:23:25.199
-Okay, I gotta go.
-Okay.

1:23:29.171 --> 1:23:30.471
Hey, be safe!

1:23:43.319 --> 1:23:45.019
[girls] Goodbye! Bye.

1:24:41.243 --> 1:24:43.610
I was thinking about
cousin Nikola.

1:24:47.183 --> 1:24:52.319
I couldn't sleep last night,
'cause I was... thinking
so much about her.

1:24:53.589 --> 1:24:55.823
[sighs]

1:24:55.825 --> 1:24:57.858
I don't know how
she just got so...

1:25:00.563 --> 1:25:02.262
used up by life.

1:25:07.336 --> 1:25:11.638
She used to come around
and ask for 10, 20 bucks.

1:25:12.775 --> 1:25:14.675
Like I got any money.

1:25:18.714 --> 1:25:20.848
She just wanted to smoke it up.

1:25:21.684 --> 1:25:26.286
And she was getting beat up
so bad by that Robert guy.

1:25:27.690 --> 1:25:29.423
But she wouldn't leave him.

1:25:34.363 --> 1:25:37.464
And then she lost her job
at the cement company.

1:25:39.602 --> 1:25:41.301
Do you remeber that?

1:25:45.674 --> 1:25:48.408
I didn't even think you could
be a woman and do that job.

1:25:51.614 --> 1:25:56.650
But it turns out
all you had to do was take
a truck driving test and...

1:25:57.286 --> 1:25:59.219
and pour in cement.

1:26:12.301 --> 1:26:14.268
And then I thought about us.

1:26:22.378 --> 1:26:23.410
How maybe...

1:26:30.619 --> 1:26:33.554
Maybe you've got to go through
all the basd stuff first.

1:26:36.725 --> 1:26:37.758
You know, they--

1:26:41.263 --> 1:26:43.297
Hit a rock bottom.

1:26:47.670 --> 1:26:49.303
Hit this like low.

1:26:51.574 --> 1:26:55.709
Only it's not low,
it's like low low.

1:27:04.887 --> 1:27:08.355
Cause then maybe after that
all the good stuff happens.

1:27:09.458 --> 1:27:10.757
You know?

1:27:12.628 --> 1:27:15.429
'Cause like Nikola,
she's got a baby now.

1:27:15.864 --> 1:27:18.899
And she's with this great guy.

1:27:18.901 --> 1:27:21.235
I don't remember
his name, but...

1:27:25.374 --> 1:27:29.009
And she's got that nursing
assistents job, and...

1:27:35.451 --> 1:27:37.351
She hit bottom first.

1:27:43.359 --> 1:27:45.425
[sniffs and clears throat]

1:27:48.397 --> 1:27:49.930
[sighs]

1:27:50.432 --> 1:27:52.399
Miss Ellison...

1:27:53.669 --> 1:27:55.269
came by.

1:27:57.873 --> 1:27:59.439
Told her I'd give you this.
