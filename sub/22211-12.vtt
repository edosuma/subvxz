00:00.090 --> 00:03.600
Previously on The Flash
and Legends of Tomorrow...

00:03.601 --> 00:05.101
Thanks, man. We're good.

00:05.102 --> 00:06.570
I'm leaving Central City.

00:06.571 --> 00:08.038
Every hero has their own journey.

00:08.039 --> 00:09.740
If yours is taking you on a new path,

00:09.741 --> 00:11.274
you owe it to yourself to go.

00:11.275 --> 00:13.911
I watched the men murder you.

00:13.912 --> 00:17.048
Mother ran with Mari. She abandoned me.

00:17.049 --> 00:18.348
I'm sorry, Kuasa.

00:18.349 --> 00:20.784
When Nora was possessed by Mallus,

00:20.785 --> 00:22.519
he seemed scared of my totem.

00:23.429 --> 00:25.089
You're one of the six.

00:25.090 --> 00:27.391
Maybe these totems are
the keys to stopping him.

00:27.392 --> 00:29.526
I only know about five totems.
Could there be more?

00:29.527 --> 00:31.962
That woman clearly has a crush on you.

00:31.963 --> 00:33.997
I thought that maybe if you'd
like to come to the ship...

00:33.998 --> 00:36.634
There's no time. Director
Hunter has escaped.

00:36.635 --> 00:39.371
Wally West, I need your help.

00:46.686 --> 00:48.357
DESTINY

00:55.153 --> 00:57.688
This way, lads.

01:00.425 --> 01:04.428
¶ 15 men on a dead man's chest ¶

01:04.429 --> 01:08.666
¶ Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum ¶

01:09.029 --> 01:11.001
This be the spot!

01:11.002 --> 01:13.203
Get to digging.

01:13.204 --> 01:15.338
Surely you don't need
for these men to be known

01:15.339 --> 01:17.374
where we buried our treasure.

01:17.375 --> 01:20.010
Our treasure, my love?

01:20.011 --> 01:22.613
Ay, ours... and no one else's.

01:22.614 --> 01:26.417
Oh, no, no, don't concern
yourself over a few doubloons.

01:26.418 --> 01:30.053
I didn't show these sorry sea dogs

01:30.054 --> 01:33.223
the most valuable trinket

01:33.224 --> 01:34.625
in me possession.

01:34.626 --> 01:38.128
An emerald fit...

01:38.129 --> 01:41.065
For a pirate queen.

01:45.303 --> 01:47.038
How do I look?

01:52.711 --> 01:54.878
Anne?

01:56.263 --> 01:57.715
Edward!

01:57.716 --> 01:58.983
Take it off!

02:03.602 --> 02:08.591
www.TUSUBTITULO.com
-DIFUNDE LA CULTURA-

02:11.262 --> 02:13.430
I don't know what I'm looking at.

02:13.431 --> 02:15.465
Looks like a hemorrhoid.

02:15.466 --> 02:18.602
What? No, it... it's Mallus. Demon horns?

02:18.603 --> 02:21.372
Anyway, the hunt for the
six totems has begun.

02:21.373 --> 02:23.373
There are only five tribes in Zambesi.

02:23.374 --> 02:24.908
Each was gifted with a totem.

02:24.909 --> 02:26.677
And I checked; there's
no record of a sixth.

02:26.678 --> 02:28.845
Well, the good news is that we have

02:28.846 --> 02:30.781
the Air and the Spirit Totems.

02:30.782 --> 02:32.315
Kuasa has the Water Totem.

02:32.316 --> 02:34.585
And since the final totem
is a complete mystery,

02:34.586 --> 02:37.154
that leaves us looking
for Earth and Fire.

02:37.155 --> 02:38.288
Now, the Fire Totem,

02:38.289 --> 02:40.758
which is currently smashed, BTW,

02:40.759 --> 02:43.526
was last seen in a
Detroit museum in 2018.

02:43.527 --> 02:45.028
Wait, how do you know that?

02:45.029 --> 02:48.331
Because it is with your
granddaughter Mari's...

02:48.332 --> 02:50.901
or AKA the other Vixen's... boyfriend,

02:50.902 --> 02:52.636
Dr. Adam Macalester.

02:52.637 --> 02:55.673
He's dedicated his life to the
study of the Zambesi totems.

02:55.674 --> 02:57.942
Well, if Constantine is right

02:57.943 --> 03:00.611
and the only thing that
Mallus fears is the sixth,

03:00.612 --> 03:02.379
then we need to get our
hands on the Fire Totem.

03:03.783 --> 03:05.281
Collect the set, win a prize.

03:05.282 --> 03:07.250
We need to tell Sara
we gotta get to Detroit.

03:07.251 --> 03:09.353
Nope, she's off to Star City.

03:09.354 --> 03:12.022
She's been texting some guy.
They're going on a date.

03:12.023 --> 03:13.757
How do you know? What, are
you looking at her phone?

03:13.758 --> 03:16.326
I look at everyone's phone.
Helps pass the time.

03:16.327 --> 03:18.395
Well... who's she going on a date with?

03:18.396 --> 03:20.063
Obviously it's Ava.

03:20.064 --> 03:22.633
- Oh, that's hot.
- What's hot?

03:23.735 --> 03:25.602
The Fire Totem. Hot, hot.

03:25.603 --> 03:27.237
Very hot and currently in Detroit,

03:27.238 --> 03:29.973
so what do you say we motor
off to the Motor City?

03:29.974 --> 03:32.308
Right now?

03:33.393 --> 03:36.112
I might sit this one out,

03:36.113 --> 03:39.116
because I have to do...

03:39.117 --> 03:41.085
business back home.

03:41.086 --> 03:43.021
I bet you do.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:53.965 --> 03:56.133
Hi.

03:56.134 --> 03:58.168
Wow.

03:58.169 --> 03:59.269
You look...

03:59.270 --> 04:01.638
Weird. I look weird, right?

04:01.639 --> 04:03.974
I was gonna say beautiful, but...

04:03.975 --> 04:05.342
Thank you. So do you.

04:05.343 --> 04:07.645
It's... wow.

04:10.849 --> 04:13.584
Do you wanna...

04:16.154 --> 04:19.022
Right.

04:19.023 --> 04:20.123
Oh, you know what, I'll just have

04:20.124 --> 04:21.358
whatever she's having, please.

04:21.358 --> 04:23.327
Vodka Martini, extra dirty, stirred.

04:23.328 --> 04:25.195
Stirred, not shaken?

04:25.196 --> 04:27.197
Shaken's for lightweights who
like their booze watered down.

04:27.198 --> 04:28.832
And James Bond.

04:28.833 --> 04:30.968
James Bond never had to
fight off a horde of Vikings

04:30.969 --> 04:33.337
or help me escape a demon realm.

04:33.338 --> 04:34.804
True.

04:36.484 --> 04:38.375
How was work?

04:38.376 --> 04:40.110
Work is...

04:41.007 --> 04:42.779
This is awful.

04:42.780 --> 04:44.147
You know what, I have an idea.

04:44.148 --> 04:45.682
Let's just try to be
normal for one night.

04:45.683 --> 04:48.051
No Legends, no bureau. What do you think?

04:48.052 --> 04:49.653
- There you are.
- Thank you.

04:49.654 --> 04:51.822
I feel like relationships
are complicated enough

04:51.823 --> 04:54.358
without time-travel and
supervillains, don't you?

04:54.359 --> 04:55.926
Okay...

04:55.927 --> 04:58.662
Then here's to being two regular women

04:58.663 --> 05:01.498
on a completely normal first date.

05:01.499 --> 05:03.535
Completely normal.

05:12.610 --> 05:15.412
Hey... you okay?

05:15.413 --> 05:17.080
My granddaughter,

05:17.081 --> 05:20.083
the good one, she's out there.

05:20.084 --> 05:22.719
I wanna see her more than anything.

05:22.720 --> 05:26.223
But you can't without
screwing up history.

05:26.224 --> 05:29.293
Some days, I wish I had
never heard of time-travel.

05:29.294 --> 05:30.995
Yeah.

05:33.064 --> 05:35.065
Oh, I like what you've
done with your hair.

05:35.066 --> 05:37.300
Oh, really? I hate it.

05:37.301 --> 05:39.302
- Good news!
- Bad news.

05:39.303 --> 05:40.937
What's going on?

05:40.938 --> 05:42.305
- I know where their totem is.
- The Fire Totem's gone.

05:42.306 --> 05:43.840
Ray-Ray, you go first.

05:43.841 --> 05:45.942
We tried to steal the Fire Totem

05:45.943 --> 05:47.811
from your granddaughter's boyfriend,

05:47.812 --> 05:50.514
but someone beat us to it.

05:50.515 --> 05:51.916
Damien Darhk.

05:53.751 --> 05:55.652
"Dear, Legends, now I have two."

05:55.653 --> 05:58.789
You know, for a megalomaniac,
he has very lovely penmanship.

05:58.790 --> 06:00.390
I know, right?

06:00.391 --> 06:01.958
Oh, and by the way, don't
worry, Macalester's fine.

06:01.959 --> 06:03.160
Can I talk now, please?

06:03.161 --> 06:04.695
Yeah. You said you had good news.

06:04.696 --> 06:06.896
I know where the Earth Totem is,

06:06.897 --> 06:10.166
or, more precisely, when:

06:10.167 --> 06:13.737
1717, Saint Lisette.

06:13.738 --> 06:16.606
St. Lisette? Sister ship of La Concorde?

06:16.607 --> 06:18.208
Get to the point, pretty.

06:18.209 --> 06:20.443
La Concorde was boarded by pirates,

06:20.444 --> 06:22.746
and later named Queen Anne's Revenge.

06:22.747 --> 06:25.315
It's Blackbeard the Pirate's ship.

06:25.316 --> 06:27.917
So, Blackbeard has the Earth Totem.

06:27.918 --> 06:29.286
Well, let's steal it.

06:29.287 --> 06:31.588
No, guys, hold on, Sara's on a date.

06:31.589 --> 06:34.024
We should probably avoid
messing with history

06:34.025 --> 06:35.558
while she's still on appetizers?

06:35.559 --> 06:37.427
But... think how happy she'd be

06:37.428 --> 06:39.230
if we had the Earth Totem by dessert.

06:40.193 --> 06:42.499
At this juncture, the
responsible thing to do

06:42.500 --> 06:44.167
would be to consult Captain Lance.

06:44.168 --> 06:47.477
Who would tell us we can't risk
the Darhks getting another totem.

06:47.838 --> 06:52.309
All those in favor of
setting a course to 1717...

06:52.310 --> 06:53.577
Aye.

06:53.578 --> 06:56.446
- Aye.
- Aye!

06:56.737 --> 06:57.460
Aye.

07:06.091 --> 07:08.491
How are we supposed to find
Blackbeard in this rabble?

07:08.492 --> 07:10.460
Well, we could ask a pirate nicely.

07:10.461 --> 07:13.863
Nicely? Wait, pirates are
terrified of Blackbeard.

07:13.864 --> 07:15.499
They're not gonna just offer up some...

07:15.500 --> 07:17.968
So, you're looking for Blackbeard?

07:17.969 --> 07:21.638
How do I know you's not
spies for the Royal Navy?

07:23.140 --> 07:26.176
Because we wanna join
Blackbeard's crew, you germ.

07:32.437 --> 07:34.419
YUNNAN PROVINCE, CHINA - 2018

07:34.420 --> 07:36.588
It's...

07:36.589 --> 07:40.425
it's rather a lovely place
you've traveled to, Mr. West.

07:40.426 --> 07:42.027
How'd you find me?

07:42.028 --> 07:44.128
By tracking the geolocation
of your MP3 player.

07:44.129 --> 07:46.364
Your playlist consists
of a rather amazing

07:46.365 --> 07:47.832
number of repetitions

07:47.833 --> 07:50.135
of George Michael's "Careless Whisper."

07:50.136 --> 07:51.770
Jesse loved that song.

07:51.771 --> 07:53.305
I assume that your recent heartbreak

07:53.306 --> 07:55.841
is the reason for your spiritual quest.

07:55.842 --> 07:58.944
However, with the fate
of the world at stake,

07:58.945 --> 08:01.746
I... I'm afraid that you can
no longer sit idly by.

08:01.747 --> 08:03.148
Well, I... I'm sorry, my friend,

08:03.149 --> 08:04.849
but my days of "fwathooming" are over.

08:04.850 --> 08:07.085
Right now, I'm living my life

08:07.086 --> 08:09.354
one quarter-mile at a time.

08:09.355 --> 08:11.290
Was that a Buddhist koan?

08:11.291 --> 08:14.226
Dom Toretto, "The
Fast and the Furious."

08:14.227 --> 08:16.061
Aren't you BFFs with the Legends?

08:16.062 --> 08:18.597
I'm sure my boy, Nate, can help you out.

08:19.144 --> 08:23.435
It seems that my days
of Legending are over.

08:23.436 --> 08:25.604
Alas, you're quite secure

08:25.605 --> 08:28.206
in your decision to slow things down?

08:28.207 --> 08:29.807
I am.

08:29.808 --> 08:32.711
Well, the last time I was this far east

08:32.712 --> 08:34.379
was in the Opium Wars.

08:34.380 --> 08:36.515
It'd be a shame to waste a trip.

08:36.515 --> 08:37.849
Fancy a drink?

08:37.850 --> 08:39.852
Another flagon of ale!

08:39.852 --> 08:42.390
NASSAU - 1717

08:45.958 --> 08:48.626
So, this is where Blackbeard hangs out.

08:48.627 --> 08:51.663
- Classy.
- Yep.

08:51.664 --> 08:52.998
Line 'em up.

08:58.004 --> 08:59.637
What's up?

08:59.638 --> 09:01.040
Nothing.

09:02.975 --> 09:04.810
I said what's up.

09:06.445 --> 09:08.847
Fine, you're an unbiased listener.

09:08.848 --> 09:12.650
I want to change my
granddaughter Kuasa's past,

09:12.651 --> 09:16.088
and, well, improve her future.

09:16.089 --> 09:19.124
- So, do it.
- It's not that simple.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.726
What if I inadvertently change

09:20.727 --> 09:23.262
my other granddaughter's destiny?

09:23.263 --> 09:24.830
So, don't do it.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.731
And then there's Nate.

09:26.732 --> 09:29.401
I still have to go back to
1942 and marry someone else,

09:29.402 --> 09:32.337
so that Kuasa and Mari are even born.

09:32.338 --> 09:35.106
We can never end up together.

09:35.107 --> 09:37.142
I feel paralyzed.

09:37.143 --> 09:38.810
Every step I take,

09:38.811 --> 09:42.614
it feels like it could just
have disastrous consequences.

09:42.615 --> 09:44.415
Take a look around.

09:44.416 --> 09:46.985
Do you think these people give
a damn about consequences?

09:46.986 --> 09:48.586
Take the night off.

09:48.587 --> 09:50.988
A true pirate doesn't live for tomorrow.

09:50.989 --> 09:53.525
They only live for the moment.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.493
Thanks, Mick...

09:55.494 --> 09:58.434
but I don't know the first
thing about acting like a pirate.

10:01.034 --> 10:04.202
Well... I do.

10:04.203 --> 10:05.970
It was just Laurel and I.

10:05.971 --> 10:07.272
I was always the rebel,

10:07.273 --> 10:09.808
and she was always the good one.

10:09.809 --> 10:11.443
Why do you look like
you already know this?

10:11.941 --> 10:13.712
What'd, you Google me?

10:13.713 --> 10:16.214
No. I may have read your file...

10:16.215 --> 10:18.049
back when you were a
fugitive from the bureau.

10:18.050 --> 10:19.618
And, look, I know that sounds stalkery,

10:19.619 --> 10:22.086
but in my defense, I did
not see this coming.

10:22.087 --> 10:24.656
Well, what do you wanna know?

10:24.657 --> 10:28.293
Okay. You always seem
so composed and cool,

10:28.294 --> 10:30.662
but you can't be all cool all the time.

10:30.663 --> 10:33.732
What's the most embarrassed
you've ever been?

10:33.733 --> 10:35.500
That's an easy one:

10:35.501 --> 10:37.803
first time I ever had
a weapon in my hand.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.370
- Lian Yu?
- Nope...

10:39.371 --> 10:41.840
Starling City Elementary.

10:41.841 --> 10:44.342
I was Peter Pan in the school play.

10:44.343 --> 10:45.676
I got up on stage in the first scene,

10:45.677 --> 10:47.312
and I just totally froze.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.513
I couldn't remember any of my lines.

10:48.514 --> 10:50.248
It was like my mind just went blank.

10:50.249 --> 10:53.985
What'd you do?

10:53.986 --> 10:56.555
Well, I broke out into
a tap dance, of course,

10:56.556 --> 10:58.289
and then I ran off stage crying.

10:58.290 --> 11:01.326
You can dance?

11:01.327 --> 11:03.428
Go ahead. You can check it.

11:03.429 --> 11:06.097
I... I'm sure it's nothing, but just...

11:06.098 --> 11:07.399
It's a voicemail. I'm just gonna listen.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.500
It's okay.

11:09.757 --> 11:11.202
It wasn't my idea,

11:11.203 --> 11:13.204
but the team has taken the
Waverider on a joyride

11:13.205 --> 11:15.040
to the Bahamas 1717,

11:15.041 --> 11:17.809
in a futile attempt to locate
the missing Earth Totem.

11:17.810 --> 11:19.779
Just thought you should know.

11:22.882 --> 11:24.983
Is everything okay?

11:24.984 --> 11:27.452
Yeah, totally fine. Normal, in fact.

11:40.633 --> 11:42.567
Captain wants to see you.

11:42.568 --> 11:45.604
- Ah, man, Sara's here?
- Not that one, you dumbass.

11:45.605 --> 11:48.072
I'm talking about the most
fearsome pirate queen

11:48.073 --> 11:50.542
to sail the Seven Seas:

11:50.543 --> 11:52.744
The Dread Pirate Jiwe.

11:55.348 --> 11:58.082
- She needs to loosen up.
- Yeah.

11:58.083 --> 12:01.553
I heard she once cut out a man's tongue

12:01.554 --> 12:03.087
for not obeying her orders.

12:03.088 --> 12:06.024
Yeah... and she still
carries it to this day.

12:06.025 --> 12:08.526
I never heard of no lady pirate.

12:08.527 --> 12:10.963
That's because dead men tell no tales.

12:13.465 --> 12:15.700
They say she lost her ship to a Kraken,

12:15.701 --> 12:17.168
and in retribution,

12:17.169 --> 12:19.570
she hunted down the monster's wee bairn

12:19.571 --> 12:21.373
and ate the gupper raw.

12:21.374 --> 12:24.843
I heard she was spat back
in hell by the devil himself.

12:24.844 --> 12:28.613
I hear she be more bold and fearless

12:28.614 --> 12:31.417
than Captain Blackbeard.

12:34.620 --> 12:37.522
Begging your pardon, Captain.

12:37.523 --> 12:40.625
What was that you said?

12:40.626 --> 12:42.960
I have it under good authority

12:42.961 --> 12:47.500
we be in the company of
the Dread Pirate Jiwe.

12:51.336 --> 12:53.839
Why is everyone staring at me?

12:53.840 --> 12:56.608
If there's one thing pirates
love more than treasure,

12:56.609 --> 12:58.110
it's a good story.

13:01.881 --> 13:04.516
Blackbeard. He's heading this way.

13:04.517 --> 13:06.217
- Hit me.
- What?

13:06.218 --> 13:07.785
The mission is yours.

13:07.786 --> 13:09.320
Have fun getting Earth Totem back.

13:09.321 --> 13:11.557
Hit me.

13:15.794 --> 13:17.161
Now get out of my sight

13:17.162 --> 13:19.031
before I really lose my temper!

13:26.839 --> 13:28.840
So, you're the...

13:28.841 --> 13:32.110
Dread Pirate Jiwe, eh?

13:35.347 --> 13:37.783
Welcome to Nassau.

13:40.352 --> 13:42.387
Rory, Amaya, come in, over?

13:42.388 --> 13:44.389
Some sort of interference
with the communications system.

13:44.390 --> 13:45.890
Guys, answer me! Over?

13:45.891 --> 13:47.392
Hey, calm down. I'm sure they're okay.

13:47.393 --> 13:49.227
My apologies,

13:49.228 --> 13:51.730
but I'm experiencing a
Level 4 systems failure.

13:51.731 --> 13:53.564
Wasn't me. Nothing to do with it.

13:53.565 --> 13:55.466
I believe the fault lies
in our present coordinates.

13:55.467 --> 13:58.269
You did park us in the middle
of the Bermuda Triangle.

13:58.270 --> 14:00.738
Sailors call it the Devil's Triangle.

14:00.739 --> 14:02.607
No, the stories of ships disappearing

14:02.608 --> 14:03.876
are grossly exaggerated.

14:07.446 --> 14:09.916
You sure about that, Ray?

14:10.582 --> 14:13.184
The scuttlebutt is...

14:13.185 --> 14:15.287
you're wanting to join me crew.

14:15.288 --> 14:18.890
The Dread Pirate Jiwe works for no man.

14:18.891 --> 14:21.126
What we seek is treasure.

14:21.127 --> 14:24.195
As does every pirate worth his...

14:24.196 --> 14:27.632
or her salt.

14:27.633 --> 14:29.834
You know, I believe that you have

14:29.835 --> 14:32.637
this particular treasure
in your possession.

14:32.638 --> 14:36.442
It's a necklace with a
very large emerald.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.878
That description
doesn't strike a chord.

14:40.879 --> 14:42.882
Let me jog your memory!

14:50.856 --> 14:52.323
A couple of pirates

14:52.324 --> 14:55.995
after me own cold black heart.

14:57.629 --> 15:01.065
I'll tell you where the trinket is...

15:01.066 --> 15:02.434
but at a price.

15:04.436 --> 15:07.705
I'm here for the pirate
known as Blackbeard.

15:07.706 --> 15:10.107
I expect you'll be wanting to see

15:10.108 --> 15:12.276
me letter of mark.

15:12.277 --> 15:14.111
A forgery, no doubt.

15:14.112 --> 15:17.116
Your letter will win no favor with me.

15:23.522 --> 15:26.925
I wouldn't so much as
breathe if I were you.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.994
Good evening, Ms. Jiwe.

15:31.964 --> 15:35.533
They say the third time is a charm,

15:35.534 --> 15:39.774
but this charm is the third.

15:39.775 --> 15:41.839
No!

15:52.276 --> 15:54.144
You know, I must commend
you, Lieutenant Maynard,

15:54.145 --> 15:57.381
for leading us straight to
Blackbeard and his associates.

15:57.382 --> 15:59.484
- You're most welcome, Admiral.
- Admiral?

15:59.485 --> 16:01.452
I know, right? I look so handsome.

16:01.453 --> 16:03.426
And I'll be made Commodore,

16:03.427 --> 16:05.228
once Blackbeard's severed head

16:05.229 --> 16:07.131
swings from my ship's bowspirit.

16:07.132 --> 16:09.032
You know, the last
Kingsman who threatened me

16:09.033 --> 16:10.500
ended up begging for his own life.

16:10.501 --> 16:12.303
Gentlemen, please.

16:12.304 --> 16:15.505
You may continue all threats
and counter-threats

16:15.506 --> 16:18.075
as soon as I get what I need:

16:18.076 --> 16:19.946
The Emerald Necklace.

16:19.947 --> 16:21.679
Where is it?

16:21.680 --> 16:23.346
That's Blackbeard you're talking to,

16:23.347 --> 16:25.616
- and he ain't gonna say...
- I buried it on Grace Island.

16:25.617 --> 16:27.851
Would you like me to draw you a map?

16:27.852 --> 16:29.286
I can't promise to make it to scale,

16:29.287 --> 16:31.855
but... I can do my damndest.

16:31.856 --> 16:33.124
You heard the man.

16:35.593 --> 16:38.330
Let's have another drink.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.000
It's appear to be empty.

16:43.001 --> 16:44.821
Give me some of that.

16:45.437 --> 16:47.171
No, this... this is not for you.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.605
Please, I drank Hemingway

16:48.606 --> 16:50.440
and van Gogh under the table.

16:50.441 --> 16:52.910
Cisco gave this to me
before I left Central City.

16:52.911 --> 16:54.578
The only way a speedster could get drunk

16:54.579 --> 16:56.880
is off of this rocket fuel.

16:56.881 --> 16:58.549
- Rocket fuel?
- Yeah.

17:07.061 --> 17:08.425
Cisco's a bloody genius.

17:08.425 --> 17:10.493
Yeah, he is.

17:10.494 --> 17:14.263
So is Barry and Caitlin and Wells.

17:14.265 --> 17:17.467
Wait, maybe that's why I
never fit on Team Flash.

17:17.468 --> 17:18.969
And here I was,

17:18.970 --> 17:20.671
thinking you were roaming
the Chinese countryside,

17:20.672 --> 17:23.008
because your girlfriend
needed more space.

17:24.442 --> 17:26.309
Yeah, I can do one
better than that, mate.

17:26.310 --> 17:28.678
Both of my favorite prodigies

17:28.679 --> 17:31.648
conspired to have me put in prison.

17:31.649 --> 17:32.983
What happened?

17:32.984 --> 17:34.651
Well, I lied to Sara,

17:34.652 --> 17:36.987
in addition to accidentally aiding

17:36.988 --> 17:39.189
in the resurrection of the
man who killed her sister.

17:39.190 --> 17:42.158
And Ava is angry at me

17:42.159 --> 17:44.261
for sending good agents...

17:44.262 --> 17:46.363
to their deaths.

17:46.364 --> 17:49.266
Whoa... sounds like
you're a bit of a douche.

17:49.267 --> 17:52.269
- No... no offense.
- No, none taken, no.

17:52.270 --> 17:53.770
I intend to make it up to both of them,

17:53.771 --> 17:56.139
but first, I need the teenciest,

17:56.140 --> 17:58.477
teenciest of favors.

17:58.944 --> 18:00.844
Hey, Agent McNeil,

18:00.845 --> 18:03.813
just calling to say congrats on
being named agent of the month.

18:03.814 --> 18:06.318
Ah, the bureau's lucky to have you.

18:08.385 --> 18:10.187
I'm coming for you, McNeil.

18:17.295 --> 18:18.963
Hello?

18:18.964 --> 18:20.832
Who's there?

18:26.137 --> 18:27.805
Not again.

18:27.806 --> 18:30.674
This is way more fun than meditating.

18:30.675 --> 18:32.008
I know!

18:32.009 --> 18:33.944
Wait, there is one item

18:33.945 --> 18:36.713
we must procure from the
bureau's storage closet,

18:36.714 --> 18:38.415
and one...

18:38.416 --> 18:40.317
that is very near and dear to my heart.

18:48.788 --> 18:49.860
We're screwed.

18:49.861 --> 18:51.494
The ship's electrical systems

18:51.495 --> 18:54.464
are experiencing multiple
unexplained malfunctions.

18:54.465 --> 18:56.666
- It's the Devil's Triangle.
- Look, that's just a myth.

18:56.667 --> 18:58.636
Whatever it is, we need
to time-jump out of here.

18:58.637 --> 19:02.406
What? And leave Mick and Amaya
stranded in pirate times?

19:02.407 --> 19:05.075
It's a miracle we're still in the air.

19:05.076 --> 19:06.277
Well, I'm sure they're having

19:06.278 --> 19:08.012
a whale of a time with Blackbeard.

19:14.652 --> 19:16.319
What's so funny about getting
your head chopped off?

19:17.056 --> 19:18.489
There are worse ends,

19:18.490 --> 19:22.159
like the one I brought
on that fool admiral.

19:22.160 --> 19:24.394
That necklace is cursed.

19:24.395 --> 19:27.997
I saw its dastardly
work with me own eyes.

19:27.998 --> 19:30.968
Get your hands off me, you blaggards!

19:34.205 --> 19:35.706
I'm so sorry, Mick.

19:35.707 --> 19:37.875
If I really was the Dread Pirate Jiwe,

19:37.876 --> 19:40.043
I never would've let
Darhk steal my totem.

19:40.044 --> 19:41.778
What the hell are you apologizing for?

19:41.779 --> 19:43.680
You're better than a story,

19:43.681 --> 19:44.948
and a hell of a lot more fearsome

19:44.949 --> 19:48.018
than some pirate queen,

19:48.019 --> 19:50.086
with or without your totem.

19:50.087 --> 19:52.756
This man, Edward Teach,

19:52.757 --> 19:56.327
has been convicted of unlawful
piracy and plunder...

19:56.905 --> 19:59.229
Therefore, it is my duty

19:59.230 --> 20:00.665
as an instrument of the crown to...

20:06.704 --> 20:08.373
- Watch out!
- Oy!

20:15.446 --> 20:18.616
You're in sore need of a sword, pirate.

20:25.256 --> 20:27.057
Gideon, maybe you could
help us settle an argument.

20:27.058 --> 20:28.792
What are the chances of survival

20:28.793 --> 20:30.293
if we stay in the Bermuda Triangle?

20:30.294 --> 20:32.029
Zero. There are multiple cannonballs

20:32.030 --> 20:33.563
headed towards our
starboard bow as we speak.

20:34.019 --> 20:35.232
Sorry, cannonballs?

20:35.233 --> 20:37.001
I thought we were cloaked.

20:51.081 --> 20:52.882
I told you coming here was a bad idea.

20:52.883 --> 20:54.284
Who the heck is firing at us?

20:54.285 --> 20:55.919
I want that ship brought down!

20:55.920 --> 20:58.323
- Fire another volley!
- Aye, sir!

21:12.703 --> 21:14.538
You wouldn't kill an unarmed man.

21:17.141 --> 21:19.309
You're showing him mercy!

21:19.310 --> 21:21.678
Shut up! We just saved your hairy neck.

21:21.679 --> 21:23.380
Try to keep up, boys.

21:32.256 --> 21:33.924
Gideon, jump us out of here!

21:36.661 --> 21:38.662
My heart is pounding,
my palms are sweating,

21:38.663 --> 21:40.697
and I know that I only have a
few rounds left in my pocket.

21:40.698 --> 21:42.265
So, what'd you do?

21:42.266 --> 21:44.167
I grabbed a guy and used
him as a human shield.

21:44.168 --> 21:45.835
And from that point on,

21:45.836 --> 21:48.271
no one would ever play
paintball with me ever again.

21:48.272 --> 21:50.907
Well, it sounds like a hell
of a 15th birthday party.

21:52.477 --> 21:55.178
You okay?

21:55.179 --> 21:57.847
Gonna run to the
restroom really quickly.

21:57.848 --> 21:59.684
I'm sorry.

22:13.997 --> 22:16.301
We're gonna need the check.

22:18.668 --> 22:22.138
Please tell me that the Waverider
did not just crash into Star City.

22:22.139 --> 22:23.973
Star City? Is that where we are?

22:23.974 --> 22:25.468
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

22:25.469 --> 22:28.211
Well, the good news is the
cannonball didn't hit the time-core.

22:29.880 --> 22:31.747
And Nate made a beautiful landing.

22:31.748 --> 22:34.650
- Yeah...
- Thanks, big guy.

22:34.651 --> 22:37.119
So, Sara, how's the date going?

22:37.120 --> 22:40.122
It's over.

22:40.123 --> 22:41.457
Here... come here.

22:41.458 --> 22:42.859
What the hell are you doing here?

22:42.860 --> 22:44.126
Please don't be mad.

22:44.127 --> 22:45.761
You weren't answering your phone.

22:45.762 --> 22:47.897
This better be a life
or death emergency, Gary.

22:47.898 --> 22:49.399
Worse.

22:49.400 --> 22:51.734
A speedster stole my time courier,

22:51.735 --> 22:54.170
- and then pantsed me.
- And then...

22:54.171 --> 22:55.571
Did you check if HQ is secure?

22:55.572 --> 22:57.473
Snug as a bug...

22:57.474 --> 22:59.075
Except one item...

22:59.076 --> 23:01.710
was reported missing from storage:

23:01.711 --> 23:03.846
a long brown coat

23:03.847 --> 23:06.816
- that used to belong to...
- Rip Hunter.

23:06.817 --> 23:09.518
- Yeah.
- Okay...

23:09.519 --> 23:12.355
You look great...... by the way.

23:12.356 --> 23:13.923
- Shut up, Gary.
- Oh... yeah.

23:13.924 --> 23:15.091
Remember when we talked
about personal space?

23:15.092 --> 23:16.126
- Yeah, okay.
- Come on.

23:19.830 --> 23:22.832
Ouch.

23:22.833 --> 23:24.500
- You...
- Double ouch.

23:24.501 --> 23:25.835
You want... you... you want
me to box it up for you?

23:25.836 --> 23:27.637
No, Gary. Okay, we need to find Rip.

23:27.638 --> 23:29.071
He's got a time courier,

23:29.072 --> 23:30.673
which means he could
be anywhere any time,

23:30.674 --> 23:32.575
causing a whole mess of problems.

23:34.311 --> 23:39.815
- TOKYO - 1992
- ¶ Time can never mend ¶

23:39.816 --> 23:43.085
¶ The careless whisper ¶

23:43.086 --> 23:46.222
¶ Of a good friend ¶

23:46.223 --> 23:49.191
¶ To the heart and mind ¶ Mind...

23:49.192 --> 23:51.727
¶ Ignorance is blind ¶

23:51.728 --> 23:54.563
¶ There's no comfort in the truth ¶

23:54.564 --> 23:58.234
¶ Pain is all you'll find ¶

23:58.235 --> 24:00.203
¶ I'm never gonna dance again ¶

24:00.204 --> 24:03.840
¶ Guilty feet ain't got no rhythm ¶

24:03.841 --> 24:05.875
¶ Though it's easy to pretend ¶

24:05.876 --> 24:07.810
¶ I know you're not a fool ¶

24:07.811 --> 24:10.313
When I left, you were
headed to Detroit.

24:10.314 --> 24:12.014
Yeah, it's a... it's... it's a really...

24:12.015 --> 24:13.515
it's a really long story.

24:13.516 --> 24:15.484
Mick and Amaya are marooned in 1717,

24:15.485 --> 24:17.153
the Darhks have the Fire Totem,

24:17.154 --> 24:18.787
and Blackbeard has the Earth Totem.

24:18.788 --> 24:21.190
I just thought it was
gonna be a longer story.

24:21.191 --> 24:22.892
Thank God you're back. You look great.

24:22.893 --> 24:24.794
The engine room's a disaster.
We're not going anywhere.

24:27.398 --> 24:29.064
I don't know who looks more ridiculous,

24:29.065 --> 24:32.034
you guys in your pirate
britches or me in this...

24:32.035 --> 24:35.038
- stupid dress.
- Definitely them.

24:35.039 --> 24:37.707
Hey, I know it looks like a mess,

24:37.708 --> 24:40.276
but we really wanted you
to have a nice night out.

24:40.277 --> 24:42.278
Yeah, if you really like
that mean Time Bureau lady,

24:42.279 --> 24:43.579
you shouldn't give up on her.

24:43.580 --> 24:45.614
Look, I'm not giving up on anything,

24:45.615 --> 24:48.718
other than maybe the idea that
I'll ever have a normal life.

24:48.719 --> 24:50.953
Zari, get the ship back
in fighting shape,

24:50.954 --> 24:52.722
'cause until then...

24:52.723 --> 24:55.025
Rory and Amaya are on their own.

25:00.731 --> 25:02.398
All right, listen up.

25:02.399 --> 25:04.333
We can't let the Darhks
beat us to Grace Island

25:04.334 --> 25:05.500
and to the Earth Totem,

25:05.501 --> 25:09.204
so... we're in need of a ship.

25:09.205 --> 25:13.008
You want to sail the
Queen Anne's Revenge?

25:13.009 --> 25:16.245
I told you, that necklace is cursed.

25:16.246 --> 25:18.381
What?

25:18.382 --> 25:21.984
You're gonna let a curse stop
you from taking the gold?

25:21.985 --> 25:23.619
Aye.

25:23.620 --> 25:25.788
Why did you become a pirate
in the first place, ey?

25:25.789 --> 25:27.089
Well, I've...

25:27.090 --> 25:28.557
To let an admiral get the best of you?

25:28.558 --> 25:32.461
Or to claim your destiny
on the wide open sea?

25:32.462 --> 25:33.729
I don't know what's waiting for us

25:33.730 --> 25:35.097
on the other side of this journey,

25:35.098 --> 25:36.566
but whatever it is,

25:36.567 --> 25:38.401
it beats cowering in some alleyway,

25:38.402 --> 25:41.204
waiting for your black
beard to turn grey.

25:41.205 --> 25:45.975
I swore I'd never go
back to that island...

25:45.976 --> 25:47.576
and I'm a man of me word.

25:47.577 --> 25:50.345
Fair winds, me hearties.

25:50.346 --> 25:52.983
Blackbeard's... a coward.

25:58.488 --> 26:00.322
We don't need Blackbeard.

26:00.323 --> 26:03.026
We just need his ship.

26:07.936 --> 26:09.732
Another drink?

26:13.270 --> 26:15.071
Listen up...

26:15.072 --> 26:18.609
the Dread Pirate Jiwe
is looking for a crew.

26:21.144 --> 26:24.847
Your old Captain Blackbeard...

26:24.848 --> 26:28.317
buried his treasure on Grace Island.

26:30.553 --> 26:33.389
So, you've heard the rumors then,

26:33.390 --> 26:35.457
that the treasure is cursed?

26:35.458 --> 26:39.028
But while old Blackbeard is
afraid of his own shadow,

26:39.029 --> 26:41.363
you men...

26:41.364 --> 26:44.400
you vile and despicable men,

26:44.401 --> 26:47.336
are willing to face Davy Jones himself

26:47.337 --> 26:50.439
for a crack at gold and glory!

26:50.440 --> 26:52.875
Who's willing to join me

26:52.876 --> 26:55.311
as we take over Blackbeard's ship?

26:56.879 --> 26:58.880
Mutiny!

26:58.881 --> 27:01.951
Is that what this is, ey?

27:01.952 --> 27:06.021
You'd rather follow the Dread Pirate Jiwe

27:06.022 --> 27:07.991
than your own captain?

27:13.062 --> 27:14.764
Then I'm bloody joining you.

27:14.765 --> 27:17.633
I'll dig up me chest

27:17.634 --> 27:20.269
and share the spoils with ye men.

27:20.270 --> 27:25.208
Hats off to the Pirate Queen!

27:46.480 --> 27:48.782
All hands on deck!

27:48.783 --> 27:53.587
Secure the backstays and
hoist the Jolly Roger high!

27:53.588 --> 27:55.256
There's land ahead.

28:00.528 --> 28:02.496
Sara!

28:02.497 --> 28:03.963
Yeah, what now?

28:03.964 --> 28:06.599
We have another anachronism in 1717.

28:06.600 --> 28:09.603
The HMS Fortitude got into a naval battle

28:09.604 --> 28:11.905
with Blackbeard's ship off
the coast of Grace Island.

28:11.906 --> 28:13.340
So?

28:13.341 --> 28:16.044
So... that is a portrait
of their admiral.

28:18.212 --> 28:20.514
Damien Darhk.

28:20.515 --> 28:22.349
I don't care if Zari has to duct-tape

28:22.350 --> 28:24.651
the Waverider back together,
we have to get it in the air.

28:24.652 --> 28:27.521
Well, I wouldn't advise
returning to the Bermuda Triangle.

28:27.522 --> 28:29.289
It's the Devil's Triangle,

28:29.290 --> 28:31.058
and Mick and Amaya are in danger.

28:33.628 --> 28:35.695
Ava! Hey!

28:35.696 --> 28:39.533
Don't "hi, Ava" me.
You stood me up, jerk.

28:39.534 --> 28:40.867
Awkward.

28:41.702 --> 28:44.468
Blackbeard draws one hell of a map.

28:44.469 --> 28:45.799
Dig.

28:52.213 --> 28:53.847
Oh, blast!

28:53.848 --> 28:56.650
I've... I've... I've left
me compass on the ship.

28:56.651 --> 28:57.984
It's a family heirloom, so I should...

28:57.985 --> 29:00.320
Turn back and I'll kill you.

29:00.321 --> 29:02.489
What aren't you telling us, ey?

29:04.192 --> 29:05.959
Well, in... in me haste,

29:05.960 --> 29:09.763
I may have left out some...
miniscule details

29:09.764 --> 29:12.465
about the cursed necklace.

29:12.466 --> 29:15.869
I gifted it to me love and queen,

29:15.870 --> 29:18.705
the most devious,

29:18.706 --> 29:22.942
and dastardly woman I've ever
had the pleasure of meeting...

29:22.943 --> 29:24.911
apart from you, I mean.

29:24.912 --> 29:27.647
But as soon as Anne put it on,

29:27.648 --> 29:32.653
something dark and unholy overtook her.

29:32.654 --> 29:35.222
Totems draw on the life
force of their bearer.

29:35.223 --> 29:37.490
So, if Anne was as wicked as you suggest,

29:37.491 --> 29:40.093
the totem would've only
amplified her worst impulses.

29:40.094 --> 29:43.863
It turned her into a monster.

29:43.864 --> 29:45.899
How did you live to tell the tale?

29:45.900 --> 29:49.137
Well, I... I did the only
decent thing any man would do.

29:50.304 --> 29:51.638
I put a musket ball in her head

29:51.639 --> 29:54.174
and buried her along with the treasure.

29:54.175 --> 29:56.042
That cursed necklace

29:56.043 --> 29:58.945
won't let her rest in peace.

29:58.946 --> 30:02.450
Me Anne will rise again.

30:10.257 --> 30:13.160
Stiffen your backbones, men!

30:13.161 --> 30:14.895
I gotta hand it to you, Ms. Lance,

30:14.896 --> 30:16.863
you take the phrase "dine and
dash" to a whole new level.

30:16.864 --> 30:18.698
Look, the Waverider
fell out of the sky.

30:18.699 --> 30:20.134
My team needed help.

30:20.135 --> 30:22.435
Why does not surprise me?

30:22.436 --> 30:24.304
Should we interrupt?

30:24.305 --> 30:28.107
No... but Ava gave me an idea.

30:28.108 --> 30:29.776
Her time courier.

30:29.777 --> 30:31.011
I'm coming with you.

30:31.012 --> 30:32.379
First I have to get the Nanite pistol.

30:32.380 --> 30:33.781
No... Ray, do...

30:46.393 --> 30:47.828
Steady...

30:51.833 --> 30:54.567
Oh, hello, Annie!

30:54.568 --> 30:56.103
Good to see you're...

30:56.104 --> 30:59.940
you're looking so... beautiful.

31:16.524 --> 31:18.391
You know, this was
never gonna work out.

31:18.392 --> 31:20.226
Really? What, because
I'm a mature person

31:20.227 --> 31:21.761
who actually can communicate?

31:21.762 --> 31:24.297
Oh, really? Such a communicator!

31:24.298 --> 31:26.332
Like when you said you were
going to the bathroom?

31:26.333 --> 31:29.335
- What are you talking about?
- You think I didn't see Gary?

31:29.336 --> 31:31.604
Oh, my... Rip broke into the Time Bureau.

31:31.605 --> 31:33.273
I was coming back to
the table to tell you.

31:33.274 --> 31:34.741
- You know, this is pointless.
- Yeah, it is.

31:34.742 --> 31:36.409
We should have never
tried to be normal.

31:36.410 --> 31:38.211
I'm not normal, all right?
I'm never gonna be normal,

31:38.212 --> 31:39.713
and I'm not gonna be normal for anyone!

31:39.714 --> 31:41.848
I don't want you to be normal!

31:41.849 --> 31:43.416
You don't?

31:43.417 --> 31:44.919
Hell no.

32:00.935 --> 32:02.235
What?

32:02.236 --> 32:03.536
Oh, no, the kissing was great.

32:03.537 --> 32:05.238
It's just...

32:05.239 --> 32:07.441
We claim this ship

32:07.442 --> 32:10.310
and ye two women...

32:10.311 --> 32:11.811
as ours!

32:11.812 --> 32:13.314
Come on.

32:14.982 --> 32:16.584
Hey...

32:18.553 --> 32:21.921
Let's do this.

32:28.963 --> 32:31.531
Come on, you namby-pamby.

32:31.532 --> 32:33.634
They're mere lassies!

32:37.071 --> 32:39.373
Listen to me...

32:39.374 --> 32:43.443
that totem can burden
even one born to wear it.

32:43.444 --> 32:46.614
I know it must feel like a
noose around your neck.

32:48.382 --> 32:51.185
Let me help you break free of this curse.

32:59.093 --> 33:00.828
Thank you for distracting her.

33:08.335 --> 33:11.405
Unfortunately, now I have to kill you.

33:20.681 --> 33:22.416
Surprisingly powerful.

33:30.090 --> 33:33.694
Well, that was fun,
but playtime is over.

33:35.930 --> 33:38.232
Hey, you guys!

33:42.837 --> 33:44.504
I want my totem back.

33:44.505 --> 33:45.839
Ah, you fool.

33:45.840 --> 33:47.774
We don't need swords to kill you.

33:52.847 --> 33:54.849
No!

33:56.517 --> 33:58.819
Good shot, haircut.

34:05.025 --> 34:07.427
No...

34:10.297 --> 34:12.197
No, no!

34:12.199 --> 34:13.800
Stay with me.

34:13.801 --> 34:15.935
Stay with me, sweetheart. Come on.

34:15.936 --> 34:18.237
You're gonna be okay. Stay with me.

34:18.239 --> 34:20.607
Come on. Let's go.

34:24.011 --> 34:26.512
Don't let her... come on.

34:26.513 --> 34:28.916
That was too easy.

34:32.185 --> 34:35.222
You two bonnie lasses
be the best fighters

34:35.223 --> 34:37.824
I've e'er seen.

34:37.824 --> 34:42.263
How would you like to join me crew?

34:49.884 --> 34:53.053
The Waverider, ey?

34:53.054 --> 34:55.121
She's...

34:55.123 --> 34:58.225
an usual ship.

34:58.226 --> 35:00.127
But I can think of no
more appropriate vessel

35:00.128 --> 35:03.631
for the Dread Pirate Jiwe.

35:03.632 --> 35:06.066
Thanks for saving me life

35:06.067 --> 35:10.004
and for stopping your bonnie
mates from keelhauling me.

35:10.005 --> 35:12.773
Well, thank you for leading
me to the accursed treasure.

35:12.774 --> 35:16.109
And make sure you tell them
that Captain Jiwe spared you.

35:16.110 --> 35:18.747
Absolutely. Of course, I...

35:21.283 --> 35:24.720
Fair winds, Captain Jiwe.

35:41.870 --> 35:44.038
Amaya, I am... I am so sorry.

35:44.039 --> 35:46.974
If I didn't push everybody
to go after the Earth Totem,

35:46.975 --> 35:48.775
you wouldn't have lost yours.

35:48.776 --> 35:50.311
It's all right, Nathaniel.

35:50.312 --> 35:52.880
We'll fix this. We'll
get your totem back.

35:52.881 --> 35:56.951
My birthright, it's always
dictated the path I choose.

35:56.952 --> 35:59.519
It's like a compass that
just points the way.

35:59.520 --> 36:02.389
It must be so difficult not to have it.

36:02.390 --> 36:04.091
It's also freeing.

36:04.092 --> 36:06.160
For the first time in my life,

36:06.161 --> 36:08.763
I get to decide.

36:12.100 --> 36:13.867
Amaya?

36:13.868 --> 36:17.471
You know, I learned something
from hanging out with pirates.

36:17.472 --> 36:21.141
They always focus on the
problem in front of them.

36:21.142 --> 36:23.244
And what is that problem?

36:30.118 --> 36:32.486
Do you yield, sir?

36:35.557 --> 36:37.224
Aye, Captain.

36:45.367 --> 36:47.401
Rum floats were a very good idea.

36:47.402 --> 36:50.105
Only seemed fair since
we missed dessert.

36:50.305 --> 36:51.692
CAPTAIN GODFREE
SPICED RUM

36:51.693 --> 36:53.952
CAPTAIN JIWE
SPICED RUM

36:56.193 --> 36:57.978
What?

36:57.979 --> 37:00.047
Sometimes, we screw
things up for the better.

37:00.048 --> 37:02.517
I will drink to that.

37:04.318 --> 37:05.820
Cheers.

37:07.689 --> 37:10.457
It's good.

37:10.458 --> 37:13.126
Hey, look, I'm sorry about
bailing on you earlier.

37:13.127 --> 37:15.028
I should have been honest with you

37:15.029 --> 37:16.563
about what was going on with my team...

37:16.564 --> 37:18.865
No, no-no-no-no.

37:18.866 --> 37:21.635
I never should've put the
kibosh on talking shop.

37:21.636 --> 37:23.237
You're right, it's your fault.

37:23.238 --> 37:25.672
You... oh, man...

37:25.673 --> 37:27.508
Besides, I'd rather fight
pirates with you any day

37:27.509 --> 37:30.511
than sit in some stupid restaurant.

37:30.512 --> 37:32.212
Well, in that case,

37:32.213 --> 37:35.149
I was thinking Genghis
Khan for our second date?

37:35.150 --> 37:36.650
Done...

37:36.651 --> 37:38.719
but only if I can call you Peter Pan.

37:38.720 --> 37:40.120
- Don't...
- Ms... Ms...

37:40.121 --> 37:41.056
Don't.

37:43.391 --> 37:45.025
Okay.

37:45.026 --> 37:47.328
So, you got a room on this ship or...

37:49.364 --> 37:50.965
Let's go find out.

37:59.006 --> 38:02.109
Why do you look so chipper?

38:02.110 --> 38:03.644
Oh, no, I had a terrible hangover.

38:03.645 --> 38:05.379
It lasted three minutes.

38:05.380 --> 38:08.348
The benefits of a
speedster's metabolism.

38:08.349 --> 38:10.252
Here, take these.

38:12.854 --> 38:14.255
Thank you.

38:14.256 --> 38:17.624
You know, last night was pretty fun.

38:17.625 --> 38:18.993
Yeah.

38:18.994 --> 38:22.062
I had gotten a bit
lonely here, I think.

38:22.063 --> 38:24.164
Yeah, I've been a bit lonely too.

38:24.165 --> 38:26.032
Hey, your girlfriend dumped you;

38:26.033 --> 38:27.567
your team treated you like an outcast.

38:27.568 --> 38:28.902
It's no wonder you went walk-about.

38:28.903 --> 38:31.872
But the world needs Wallace West

38:31.873 --> 38:34.008
to step in from the cold.

38:37.112 --> 38:39.546
And I know a place where
outcasts fit right in.

38:39.547 --> 38:43.116
In fact, some might say
that they become...

38:43.117 --> 38:44.351
Legends.

38:47.522 --> 38:49.624
- Care to join me?
- Wha...

38:51.426 --> 38:54.861
Is "Careless Whisper" not the
best karaoke song of all time?

38:54.862 --> 38:57.331
It is the way we sing it, mate

38:58.666 --> 39:00.533
Haircut, you want a beer?

39:00.534 --> 39:02.903
Everyone's off doing their own thing.

39:02.904 --> 39:04.671
Just you and me.

39:04.672 --> 39:07.174
Sure, could... use a beer,

39:07.175 --> 39:10.312
even if I am your last
choice of companion.

39:14.516 --> 39:15.949
Oh, that?

39:15.950 --> 39:18.551
I was just doing a bit
of light theorizing,

39:18.552 --> 39:20.220
and then I had a breakthrough.

39:20.221 --> 39:21.989
I am gonna develop a liquid

39:21.990 --> 39:24.023
for the perfect dry erase marker.

39:24.024 --> 39:26.193
Strong viscosity, clean lines.

39:26.194 --> 39:28.328
You're a terrible liar.

39:28.329 --> 39:30.464
Yeah.

39:30.465 --> 39:32.465
It's Nora.

39:32.466 --> 39:34.935
The Nanite pistol is gonna kill her,

39:34.936 --> 39:37.837
and... that's what it was supposed to do,

39:37.838 --> 39:39.773
but now I feel...

39:39.774 --> 39:43.110
- Like a badass?
- No.

39:43.111 --> 39:45.912
- Guilty.
- What?

39:45.913 --> 39:49.182
- You saved Amaya.
- I know.

39:49.183 --> 39:50.384
Doesn't really make sense,

39:50.385 --> 39:53.654
except that I met her... as a kid.

39:53.655 --> 39:57.724
Well, now she's all grown up
and joined the demon's side.

39:57.725 --> 40:00.260
Yeah.

40:00.261 --> 40:02.696
But you... you have changed

40:02.697 --> 40:06.066
since I first met you,

40:06.067 --> 40:09.169
and I hate to break it
to you, Mick, but...

40:09.170 --> 40:11.504
you are a much better person.

40:11.505 --> 40:15.476
And maybe Nora could have become one too.

40:15.477 --> 40:18.179
There was hope for her, anyway,
before I took it away.

40:28.323 --> 40:29.423
Come on, sweetheart, you gotta fight.

40:29.424 --> 40:32.125
Stay with me. Come on!

40:32.126 --> 40:33.893
Look, I... I know.

40:33.894 --> 40:36.062
I'm the last person you wanna see.

40:36.063 --> 40:37.697
What did you do to my daughter?

40:37.698 --> 40:40.267
Nothing that can't be undone.

40:40.268 --> 40:42.936
- I have a cure.
- You and your great big heart.

40:42.937 --> 40:45.872
You just couldn't handle
the guilt, could you?

40:45.873 --> 40:48.075
I've come for a trade:

40:48.076 --> 40:51.946
Amaya's totem, and I will save Nora.

40:55.283 --> 40:57.250
I honestly thought that would be harder.

40:57.251 --> 40:58.852
My daughter is all that matters.

40:58.853 --> 41:01.588
Come on!

41:01.589 --> 41:03.023
Stay.

41:10.665 --> 41:11.932
That's it.

41:15.070 --> 41:16.936
Ray?

41:16.937 --> 41:18.939
You remember me?

41:21.176 --> 41:22.376
Yes.

41:34.656 --> 41:36.991
Darling, wait...

41:40.394 --> 41:42.496
He may be of value.

41:44.632 --> 41:46.233
Welcome back.
