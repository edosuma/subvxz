00:06.773 --> 00:08.207
- Hey, sniggles.

00:08.209 --> 00:11.577
- Hey.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.045
Glad you're home.

00:13.047 --> 00:14.113
I made you some lemon chicken.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.180
- Oh, yeah? Good. Good.

00:15.182 --> 00:16.215
I'm starving.

00:16.217 --> 00:17.783
- Good.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.651
- Hi.

00:19.653 --> 00:21.253
Raymond, I saw the car.

00:21.255 --> 00:23.288
Are you hungry?

00:23.290 --> 00:25.290
- Oh, marie, I already made him
some lemon chicken.

00:25.292 --> 00:26.325
- Yeah, but you know
how he loves

00:26.327 --> 00:28.627
My spaghetti and meatballs.

00:30.230 --> 00:31.597
- Yeah, ray, go ahead.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.232
If you want spaghetti
and meatballs, go ahead.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.633
- No, no, the lemon chicken.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.101
I mean, I'm eating
the lemon chicken.

00:36.103 --> 00:37.403
- Look, eat what you want,

00:37.405 --> 00:40.406
'cause I can wrap this up
for later.

00:43.076 --> 00:47.346
- What?
Nobody cares, right?

00:47.348 --> 00:49.348
Well, give me
the meatballs.

00:50.817 --> 00:52.251
- There.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.552
- Great, great, great.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.221
- All right, debra,
sit down. There's plenty.

00:56.223 --> 00:59.425
Here, let me get rid
of that for you.

01:03.129 --> 01:04.530
- Hi, I'm ray.

01:04.532 --> 01:08.634
And I live here in long island
with my wife debra...

01:08.636 --> 01:12.805
My six-year-old daughter
and twin two-year-old boys.

01:12.807 --> 01:15.374
- My parents...

01:15.376 --> 01:25.484
Live across the street.

01:25.486 --> 01:39.198
Live across the street.

01:39.200 --> 01:42.234
- How's it going
on mount everest? Heh.

01:42.236 --> 01:45.637
Anybody die yet?

01:45.639 --> 01:48.440
- Just go watch
your sports, okay?

01:55.548 --> 01:57.850
- What?
What did I do?

01:57.852 --> 01:59.184
What?

01:59.186 --> 02:01.753
- You...You...

02:01.755 --> 02:04.490
Picked your mom's
spaghetti and meatballs

02:04.492 --> 02:05.824
Over my lemon chicken.

02:07.627 --> 02:09.495
- Wait--wait a minute.

02:09.497 --> 02:12.631
You--you said,
"have whatever you want."

02:12.633 --> 02:13.632
- I know.

02:13.634 --> 02:16.668
It's just...

02:16.670 --> 02:17.736
I don't know. It's--

02:17.738 --> 02:19.138
Oh, forget it.
It's stupid.

02:19.140 --> 02:20.873
Just forget it, okay?

02:24.310 --> 02:27.746
What the hell is wrong
with my lemon chicken?

02:29.182 --> 02:30.415
- Nothing. Nothing.

02:30.417 --> 02:31.416
It's fine.

02:31.418 --> 02:32.718
- "fine"?
- Yeah.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.453
- God, why didn't you just
come out and say it?

02:34.455 --> 02:36.421
You hate my cooking.

02:36.423 --> 02:37.422
- No, I don't.

02:37.424 --> 02:40.626
Come on; you're very...

02:40.628 --> 02:42.594
Hey, since when do you
care so much about cooking?

02:42.596 --> 02:44.229
- I don't.

02:44.231 --> 02:45.797
I don't. My mother
cares about cooking.

02:45.799 --> 02:46.797
I don't care
about it.

02:46.799 --> 02:48.800
- All right, then why are we
talking about it?

02:48.802 --> 02:51.937
- Because
I care about it, okay?

02:51.939 --> 02:53.539
I don't want
to care about it.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.474
It's just...Ugh.

02:55.476 --> 02:58.410
It's the one thing that
I'm sensitive about.

02:58.412 --> 03:00.712
- The one thing?

03:03.650 --> 03:05.918
- All right,
the big thing.

03:05.920 --> 03:08.187
It's--look,
all I'm saying

03:08.189 --> 03:09.655
Is that, you know,

03:09.657 --> 03:11.623
Given everything
that I do around here,

03:11.625 --> 03:12.925
Why do I care so much

03:12.927 --> 03:15.194
That I can't make
spaghetti and meatballs

03:15.196 --> 03:18.597
For my husband
as good as his mother?

03:18.599 --> 03:20.299
- Because...

03:20.301 --> 03:22.534
Because you're
a good wife.

03:22.536 --> 03:26.238
- Don't you ever, ever
call me that again.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.481
- Oh, frank,

03:36.483 --> 03:38.850
What are you doing,
putting back an empty thing?

03:38.852 --> 03:40.485
- That's not empty.

03:40.487 --> 03:42.588
There's some left there.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.223
- Two drops?

03:44.225 --> 03:46.625
Who's going to drink
two drops of juice?

03:46.627 --> 03:49.228
- I am.

03:49.230 --> 03:51.230
- All right.

03:51.232 --> 03:54.266
Let me pour you
a nice glass of juice.

03:56.536 --> 03:57.603
Say when.

03:57.605 --> 04:00.239
- Right there's...

04:00.241 --> 04:01.340
Perfect!

04:05.678 --> 04:08.447
Ahh!

04:08.449 --> 04:10.382
That was good.

04:10.384 --> 04:13.785
I think I'll save
the rest for later.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.287
- Hey.
- Hi.

04:15.289 --> 04:16.388
- Here's your pot.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.023
- You hungry?
- No, no.

04:18.025 --> 04:20.926
Well, you got any more
of those, uh, meatballs?

04:20.928 --> 04:24.529
- Yeah. I'll make you
a sandwich.

04:24.531 --> 04:25.931
- Yeah. Yeah.

04:25.933 --> 04:26.965
Hey, let me
ask you something.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.900
How do you make
those meatballs?

04:28.902 --> 04:30.369
- What do you mean?

04:30.371 --> 04:33.438
- I mean, uh, you know,
I know there's meat...

04:33.440 --> 04:36.608
And there's balling...

04:36.610 --> 04:38.310
But what do you put in it?

04:38.312 --> 04:39.845
Is there, like,
a recipe or something?

04:39.847 --> 04:42.281
- I stopped using a recipe
years ago.

04:42.283 --> 04:44.049
I cook from here.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.885
- And you nag
from here.

04:46.887 --> 04:49.321
Hey, how about
a sandwich for me?

04:53.559 --> 04:56.028
- Here.

04:56.030 --> 04:59.731
You can wash it down
with that.

04:59.733 --> 05:00.731
- Ma, really,
what do you do?

05:00.733 --> 05:02.534
What do you, put, like,
oregano in it and--

05:02.536 --> 05:04.303
- All of a sudden,
you want to know how to cook.

05:04.305 --> 05:05.304
What's wrong with you?

05:05.306 --> 05:08.040
- It's not for me.

05:08.042 --> 05:10.342
I want to get
the recipe for debra.

05:10.344 --> 05:11.777
- What are you
saying, raymond,

05:11.779 --> 05:14.079
That debra wants
to learn my way

05:14.081 --> 05:16.448
Of cooking spaghetti
and meatballs for you?

05:16.450 --> 05:18.050
- I think, yeah.

05:18.052 --> 05:21.353
- That's wonderful.

05:21.355 --> 05:23.889
- All right. So give me
the recipe, then.

05:23.891 --> 05:26.325
- Oh, no, no. She can't learn
from a recipe.

05:26.327 --> 05:27.659
I'll have to go over there
and show her.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.761
- No. No, no, no, no.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.963
No show. No showing. No.
Come on.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.665
Just give me the recipe.
I'll give it to her.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.901
- That's nonsense.
I'd love to show her.

05:35.903 --> 05:37.636
You go tell her
that we're gonna spend

05:37.638 --> 05:38.737
The whole afternoon together.

05:38.739 --> 05:39.738
- Today?

05:39.740 --> 05:41.973
- Yeah, of course.

05:41.975 --> 05:42.874
- Good, that'll
give me time

05:42.876 --> 05:44.743
To finish my sandwich.

05:50.450 --> 05:51.650
- Hey, baby bop.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.051
- Hey.

05:54.821 --> 05:57.622
- You know, listen,

05:57.624 --> 05:59.591
I was thinking about
what you said last night.

05:59.593 --> 06:00.592
- Mm-hmm.

06:00.594 --> 06:01.693
What if we just
asked my mother

06:01.695 --> 06:03.395
To come over and show you

06:03.397 --> 06:05.030
How to make those meatballs,
huh? Whatever.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.432
That--that way,
you would feel better

06:07.434 --> 06:09.034
Because you know
how to do it,

06:09.036 --> 06:11.136
And that--
that's better, right?

06:11.138 --> 06:12.604
What if she just comes over

06:12.606 --> 06:14.005
And just shows you
how to do it, huh?

06:14.007 --> 06:15.474
What do you think
about that?

06:15.476 --> 06:17.576
- That would be horrible.

06:18.578 --> 06:19.578
- Oh, boy.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.580
- What?

06:21.582 --> 06:22.881
- Hi, dear.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.617
I'm so glad
you want help.

06:32.925 --> 06:36.461
- I'm a good person.
Really, I am.

06:36.463 --> 06:38.797
- Well, here's your official

06:38.799 --> 06:42.033
Marie barone
spaghetti and meatballs kit,

06:42.035 --> 06:45.404
Marie barone included.

06:45.406 --> 06:46.905
Good luck.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.509
- You know, marie,

06:50.511 --> 06:51.877
You don't have to go
to all this trouble.

06:51.879 --> 06:52.877
- Yes, but raymond tells me

06:52.879 --> 06:56.715
That this is something
you really want to learn.

06:56.717 --> 06:58.417
- Yeah, I'm sure
he told you that.

06:58.419 --> 07:01.186
I'm sure he would love
for me to cook like you,

07:01.188 --> 07:02.554
Sure he would love
for me to be you.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.423
- [laughs]

07:04.425 --> 07:05.757
Well, let's start
with the meatballs

07:05.759 --> 07:09.461
And see how far we get.

07:09.463 --> 07:11.563
- Look, ma, maybe
this isn't a good time.

07:11.565 --> 07:13.498
- No, no, no, ray, you want me
to learn how to cook.

07:13.500 --> 07:14.599
I'm gonna
learn how to cook.

07:14.601 --> 07:15.801
- You know what?

07:15.803 --> 07:17.169
I'll go watch
the ball game with robert,

07:17.171 --> 07:18.537
And then, if you need me--

07:18.539 --> 07:21.540
Okay, okay.

07:21.542 --> 07:24.476
- You're in craptown,
huh?

07:24.478 --> 07:26.044
- Meet the mayor.

07:27.613 --> 07:30.515
- All right, now...

07:30.517 --> 07:32.517
To make
the perfect meatball,

07:32.519 --> 07:35.754
The most important
ingredient is the love.

07:35.756 --> 07:39.691
Without the love,
it's just a ball of meat.

07:41.627 --> 07:44.029
- "ball of meat."
- right.

07:44.031 --> 07:46.498
This is the most
essential thing.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.066
Without this,
you can't do anything.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.066
- Okay. How much
do I put in?

07:49.068 --> 07:51.970
- Well, it depends on
how much is left, dear.

07:52.972 --> 07:55.941
- All right, marie.
- Okay.

07:55.943 --> 07:57.976
- There.
- Good.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.178
- Okay, do your stuff.
I'm watching.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.947
- No, no, no,
I'm here for you,

08:01.949 --> 08:03.615
But you're the cook.

08:03.617 --> 08:04.615
- No, no, no, no.

08:04.617 --> 08:05.984
- Oh, honey,
I know you can do it.

08:05.986 --> 08:06.985
- Oh, I don't know.

08:06.987 --> 08:10.222
- No. Oh, now, honey,

08:10.224 --> 08:13.258
Meat is nothing
to be afraid of.

08:14.861 --> 08:16.595
- Okay.
- All right.

08:16.597 --> 08:19.531
- Stand back, lady.
I'm goin' in.

08:19.533 --> 08:22.100
Now, what do you
call this again?

08:22.102 --> 08:23.835
- Ha-ha-ha-ha!

08:28.541 --> 08:30.242
- All righty.

08:33.746 --> 08:35.647
- Yeah?
- Wow! Yeah, they're good!

08:35.649 --> 08:38.550
- Yes? Oh...

08:38.552 --> 08:40.118
- I mean, they're good.
They're really good.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.753
- Well, thank you.
I made them myself.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.688
I mean, you know,
your mom talked me through them,

08:43.690 --> 08:46.124
But I made them;
and you know what?

08:46.126 --> 08:47.259
She was really
great about it,

08:47.261 --> 08:48.994
And we really had fun.

08:48.996 --> 08:50.795
- Fun with my mother?
- Yeah.

08:50.797 --> 08:52.998
- Well, that's great,
and this is great.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.866
- Oh. Hoo-hoo! Good.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.167
- They're great.
- Okay.

08:56.169 --> 08:57.536
Come on, kids, dinner.

08:57.538 --> 09:00.138
We're having
mommy's meatballs, huh?

09:05.278 --> 09:07.012
- You did it.

09:08.814 --> 09:11.616
Wow! Wow! Wow!

09:17.924 --> 09:19.925
- Maybe I sauteed
the garlic too long.

09:19.927 --> 09:22.027
Was that
the weird taste?

09:22.029 --> 09:24.129
- Come on, look,
we went over this ten times,

09:24.131 --> 09:25.764
And remember
what we decided?

09:25.766 --> 09:28.767
I don't care.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.902
- Come on,
how bad were they?

09:30.904 --> 09:33.104
- They're not bad.
They're not bad.

09:33.106 --> 09:35.607
They're different
from my mother's, that's all.

09:35.609 --> 09:37.108
You know what?
They might even be better.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.778
- Oh, better.
You spit them out.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.212
- All right. Okay.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.982
Look, maybe you got
the recipe wrong, okay?

09:43.984 --> 09:45.317
That's all.

09:45.319 --> 09:46.651
- How could I get
the recipe wrong?

09:46.653 --> 09:48.753
She was right there
with me.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.755
- Well, maybe my mother
forgot to tell you

09:50.757 --> 09:53.358
Something you were
supposed to put in it.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.127
- Yeah. Yeah,
maybe she forgot.

09:59.231 --> 10:04.102
Or maybe...

10:04.104 --> 10:06.104
- What?

10:06.106 --> 10:09.741
- Yeah, maybe she...

10:09.743 --> 10:10.942
Eyecch! Huh?

10:10.944 --> 10:12.143
- No.
- Huh?

10:12.145 --> 10:14.613
- No.

10:14.615 --> 10:15.614
No.

10:15.616 --> 10:16.781
- No, ray?

10:16.783 --> 10:18.650
Oh, you don't
think it's possible

10:18.652 --> 10:21.953
That she deliberately sabotaged
my meatballs, huh?

10:21.955 --> 10:23.955
- Do you hear yourself?
- Ray.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.256
- Are you listening
to yourself?

10:25.258 --> 10:26.758
- Ray, this is
the same woman

10:26.760 --> 10:28.293
That walked in
to my thanksgiving dinner

10:28.295 --> 10:31.630
With her own turkey.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.231
- That's 'cause
you made fish.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.666
- You told me
you liked the fish!

10:34.668 --> 10:37.135
- All right, look,
okay, listen to me.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.270
I know.
I know cooking is the--

10:39.272 --> 10:42.107
The one thing that you're
sensitive about, okay?

10:42.109 --> 10:43.108
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.010
But this is crazy,

10:45.012 --> 10:49.414
Crazy, crazy,
crazy stuff here, okay?

10:49.416 --> 10:51.016
There's no--
there's no conspiracy.

10:51.018 --> 10:53.918
No, no, no. Listen.

10:53.920 --> 10:58.223
The meatballs are not
exactly like my mother's,

10:58.225 --> 11:01.893
And I'm saying to you...

11:01.895 --> 11:03.995
We have a house.

11:03.997 --> 11:07.098
We have a car.

11:07.100 --> 11:10.969
Our student loans
are paid off.

11:10.971 --> 11:14.205
You should be able
to sleep!

11:16.308 --> 11:18.309
Good night!

11:23.082 --> 11:25.450
- You're right.
I'm sorry.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.318
Good night.
- Night.

11:40.766 --> 11:44.069
- [quietly] hello.

11:44.071 --> 11:46.438
Just want
to return a spoon.

11:51.911 --> 11:54.012
[door closes]

12:07.026 --> 12:09.160
- Ooh!
- Aah!

12:10.830 --> 12:11.930
- Debra?

12:11.932 --> 12:13.098
- Robert.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.833
- Problem?

12:14.835 --> 12:16.367
- Oh, no. No, no.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.837
Um, ahem, I was just
returning this spoon,

12:18.839 --> 12:20.371
And I didn't know where
your mother kept it,

12:20.373 --> 12:21.473
So I was just
looking around.

12:21.475 --> 12:23.842
- Oh. Oh.

12:23.844 --> 12:26.044
Right here.

12:26.046 --> 12:27.812
- Okay.

12:27.814 --> 12:29.047
Great. Thanks.

12:29.049 --> 12:31.483
Good night.

12:31.485 --> 12:34.786
- Debra.
- Hmm?

12:34.788 --> 12:37.922
- Were you really here
just for the spoon?

12:37.924 --> 12:39.190
- Well, uh...

12:39.192 --> 12:40.892
- 'cause, you know,

12:40.894 --> 12:42.494
I've dealt with my fair share
of break-ins,

12:42.496 --> 12:45.230
And, uh,
I have to tell ya...

12:45.232 --> 12:47.298
It's never the spoon.

12:56.008 --> 12:57.809
- Well, all right.

12:57.811 --> 13:01.312
Um, actually, I--I just
wanted to take a look

13:01.314 --> 13:03.782
At your mom's
meatball recipe,

13:03.784 --> 13:05.483
'cause I tried to make 'em,
and, uh...

13:05.485 --> 13:07.085
- Yeah, yeah.

13:07.087 --> 13:11.156
I heard
your meatballs stink.

13:11.158 --> 13:13.424
- No, they don't stink.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.960
- That's not the word
on the street.

13:19.265 --> 13:23.568
- Robert, I--I just want
to make 'em...

13:23.570 --> 13:25.003
Perfect, you know?

13:25.005 --> 13:27.839
Did you ever want to get
something just perfect?

13:27.841 --> 13:31.276
- Sure, like when you wash
your car keys.

13:31.278 --> 13:33.244
- Yeah.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.313
- You ever
smell your keys?

13:35.315 --> 13:37.215
- Robert, could you
do me a favor?

13:37.217 --> 13:38.483
Could you just
show me

13:38.485 --> 13:40.552
Where your mom
keeps the recipes?

13:40.554 --> 13:42.120
'cause I just--I just wanted
to--to see

13:42.122 --> 13:45.023
If I jotted it down
correctly.

13:45.025 --> 13:47.826
- You want me to give
you my mom's recipe?

13:47.828 --> 13:49.828
- Please, robert?

13:49.830 --> 13:51.896
I mean,
I can't explain it.

13:51.898 --> 13:54.299
I just feel
like second best.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.234
- Second best?

13:56.236 --> 13:58.903
I can explain it to you.

14:06.979 --> 14:08.880
All right.

14:08.882 --> 14:10.081
I think I know
where she keeps 'em.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.616
- Thanks.
- Okay?

14:49.154 --> 14:51.890
- Okay, here it is:

14:51.892 --> 14:53.558
The box.

14:55.427 --> 14:57.028
- I don't think
this is the right box.

14:57.030 --> 14:59.230
- Oh, no. This is the box.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.431
This is where
she keeps her stuff

15:00.433 --> 15:03.902
For when she--you know.

15:07.373 --> 15:10.241
- Oh, my god.
It's recipes.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.243
Stuffed shells,

15:12.245 --> 15:13.912
Steak pizzaola.

15:13.914 --> 15:16.547
- Yeah, ray loves
the pizzaola.

15:16.549 --> 15:19.117
- Eggplant parmesan,
meatballs.

15:19.119 --> 15:21.519
- There you go.
- Okay, let's see.

15:24.223 --> 15:26.324
Oh, no.

15:26.326 --> 15:28.493
- What?

15:28.495 --> 15:29.560
- It's exactly the same.

15:29.562 --> 15:32.163
This is exactly
what she told me.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.464
- Well, that's good,
isn't it?

15:33.466 --> 15:36.467
- Yeah.
Yeah, it's great.

15:36.469 --> 15:39.137
The only thing
different is me.

15:39.139 --> 15:40.471
- Well, uh...

15:40.473 --> 15:42.240
C-come on, deb.

15:42.242 --> 15:45.510
You just need some practice,
that's all.

15:45.512 --> 15:46.978
Hey, it took me
a long time

15:46.980 --> 15:49.113
To get my keys
to smell right.

15:57.523 --> 15:59.590
- Oh, now what?

15:59.592 --> 16:01.626
You're runnin' away
to cooking school?

16:01.628 --> 16:03.161
- Nope.

16:03.163 --> 16:05.563
I'm packin' up
your mother's stuff.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.565
I can't cook.
I shouldn't have tried.

16:09.034 --> 16:10.234
- What are
you talkin' about?

16:10.236 --> 16:11.436
- I saw the recipe.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.504
- What?

16:13.506 --> 16:15.039
- Yes, ray.
I snuck over there.

16:15.041 --> 16:17.241
I saw the hatbox,
I found the recipe,

16:17.243 --> 16:19.243
And they're exactly
the same.

16:19.245 --> 16:21.312
- You went over there?
- Yes.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.747
- Tonight?
- Yes.

16:22.749 --> 16:27.085
Yes, and now I know that I can't
cook, so I'm giving up,

16:27.087 --> 16:29.287
'cause I don't
have the love.

16:31.223 --> 16:33.024
- You--you snuck
over there?

16:33.026 --> 16:34.625
You went
through her things?

16:34.627 --> 16:36.594
I gotta tell you
something, okay?

16:36.596 --> 16:38.329
Say what you want
about my mother--

16:38.331 --> 16:40.665
"oh, your mother!"--
yeah, my mother.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.066
My mother
came over here,

16:42.068 --> 16:43.434
And she spent
the whole day

16:43.436 --> 16:45.303
Showing you how to make
the meatballs, okay?

16:45.305 --> 16:47.438
That's my mother.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.141
Huh?

16:50.143 --> 16:53.244
Debra?

16:53.246 --> 16:55.747
- Ray, what is this?
- What?

16:55.749 --> 16:58.049
- This bottle of basil
that your mother gave me

16:58.051 --> 17:00.284
Has another label
underneath.

17:00.286 --> 17:02.353
- "tuh-rag-on."

17:02.355 --> 17:04.522
- Tarragon.

17:10.662 --> 17:12.096
- Oh, that's--that's
your weird taste.

17:12.098 --> 17:14.799
- Uh-huh.

17:14.801 --> 17:16.167
- That's not
in the recipe, is it?

17:16.169 --> 17:18.369
- [laughing] no!

17:18.371 --> 17:19.570
- Oh, my god.

17:19.572 --> 17:22.206
- Uh-huh.
Okay, ray? Okay?

17:22.208 --> 17:24.142
That's your mother!

17:24.144 --> 17:25.676
- I don't get it.

17:25.678 --> 17:27.645
- Do you still think
she's trying to help me?

17:27.647 --> 17:29.447
- Listen, why would she go
to all that trouble?

17:29.449 --> 17:31.149
Isn't it easier
to leave out an ingredient?

17:31.151 --> 17:32.683
- For an amateur!

17:32.685 --> 17:35.553
My god! This even
looks like basil!

17:35.555 --> 17:38.589
Look at the label.
It fits perfectly on here.

17:38.591 --> 17:42.260
My god, you know, this is
the work of an evil genius.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.528
- I don't get it.
I don't get it.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.263
- You know what I don't get?

17:45.265 --> 17:48.366
I don't get that you couldn't
see my side of this!

17:48.368 --> 17:51.335
You're so busy defending
your saint of a mother

17:51.337 --> 17:52.637
That you make me out

17:52.639 --> 17:55.573
To be some kind
of ungrateful nut case!

17:55.575 --> 17:57.708
Well, who's
the nut case now, ray?

17:57.710 --> 18:00.645
Who's the nut case now?

18:09.721 --> 18:11.322
- Raymond, what happened?

18:11.324 --> 18:13.191
Why did you call?
Is everybody okay?

18:13.193 --> 18:15.226
- Yeah.
- You hungry?

18:15.228 --> 18:17.361
- No.

18:17.363 --> 18:18.663
- Then what's wrong?

18:18.665 --> 18:22.200
- This, ma.
What is this?

18:22.202 --> 18:25.536
- This--this is
a jar of tarragon.

18:25.538 --> 18:29.107
Why?

18:29.109 --> 18:31.375
- Just stop, all right?
'cause we know, we know.

18:31.377 --> 18:33.244
We know all about it.

18:35.247 --> 18:38.516
This is very bad, mom.

18:42.187 --> 18:44.856
- How did you find out?

18:44.858 --> 18:46.724
- Your fake label came off.

18:48.727 --> 18:51.462
- Damn glue stick.

18:54.533 --> 18:56.767
- You know, debra's right.

18:56.769 --> 18:58.536
She's right. I don't
stick up for her enough.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.438
I'm always giving you
the benefit of the doubt

19:00.440 --> 19:01.739
'cause I don't
want to upset you,

19:01.741 --> 19:03.474
And you pull something
like this.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.809
Do you know what you did?

19:04.811 --> 19:06.511
Do you know how crazy
you drove debra?

19:06.513 --> 19:08.646
- I didn't mean
to make her crazy!

19:08.648 --> 19:11.315
I just wanted her to try
to make the meatballs,

19:11.317 --> 19:13.551
Fail, and give up.

19:13.553 --> 19:16.154
That way, everything
would stay right.

19:16.156 --> 19:17.588
- Right?

19:17.590 --> 19:20.391
What--what makes
that right?

19:20.393 --> 19:22.193
You have a problem, ma!

19:22.195 --> 19:23.494
- Okay, okay,
I have a problem,

19:23.496 --> 19:25.596
But let me ask you
something, raymond.

19:25.598 --> 19:26.864
Would you come over here
so much

19:26.866 --> 19:29.200
If I didn't
make food for you?

19:32.871 --> 19:34.939
- Yeah.

19:34.941 --> 19:38.543
I'd come over for...

19:38.545 --> 19:41.612
Other things.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.781
- What other things?

19:45.584 --> 19:48.619
- These special moments.

19:56.295 --> 19:59.931
- Raymond,
I'm your mother.

19:59.933 --> 20:03.334
I used to do
everything for you.

20:03.336 --> 20:06.504
And then, like, I blinked,
and you grew up.

20:06.506 --> 20:07.972
What do I do
for you anymore?

20:07.974 --> 20:09.807
I mean, what's left?

20:09.809 --> 20:12.243
My food.

20:12.245 --> 20:15.713
- Okay, mom, it's very,
very good food,

20:15.715 --> 20:17.548
But, no,
you can't do this.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.984
- Oh, I know, I know
it was wrong,

20:19.986 --> 20:22.954
But, just, debra asked
for my recipes, and I panicked.

20:28.760 --> 20:32.396
I'll understand if you don't
want to come over anymore.

20:36.969 --> 20:41.305
- I'm gonna
come over more.

20:41.307 --> 20:43.407
I just--I wanted you to see
what you did to debra.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.509
- I know.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

20:45.511 --> 20:46.677
I know it was wrong.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.746
I'll talk to her.

20:48.748 --> 20:52.750
- She's pretty mad, ma.

20:56.822 --> 20:59.023
- Don't worry, because
she's a mother too.

20:59.025 --> 21:00.992
She'll understand.

21:00.994 --> 21:02.994
- Yeah.

21:02.996 --> 21:06.264
- You want somethin' to eat?

21:11.637 --> 21:12.670
- All right.

21:12.672 --> 21:14.939
- Oh...

21:26.285 --> 21:28.352
That son of a bitch.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.031
- So you see, dear,
this is a list

21:40.033 --> 21:44.535
Of who gets what
when I, you know...

21:44.537 --> 21:46.404
And here's you.

21:46.406 --> 21:48.906
You were gonna get
all the recipes anyway.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.741
I just wanted to wait
till I was gone

21:50.743 --> 21:53.010
Before I was replaced.

21:53.012 --> 21:54.345
Can you understand?

21:54.347 --> 21:55.980
- I understand.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.748
- So...

21:57.750 --> 21:59.417
Here they all are.

21:59.419 --> 22:01.852
- Oh, boy.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.554
- Can you forgive me?

22:03.556 --> 22:05.723
- Will I be able to make
meatballs as good as yours?

22:05.725 --> 22:06.957
- Yes.
- Okay, I forgive you.

22:06.959 --> 22:09.493
- All right.

22:09.495 --> 22:11.929
- Okay.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.998
- So use them
in good health.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.066
- All right.

22:15.068 --> 22:16.500
- That's nice.
Isn't that nice?

22:16.502 --> 22:18.402
- Hey, where's
the steak pizzaola?
