Well, uh, yes, it's legal,

Yes.

Sally, let me stop you

The first lady has no sworn

22:14.934 --> 22:16.534
She never took an oath.

22:16.536 --> 22:18.436
Did the first lady never swear

To stand by him

We call that an oath,

22:28.597 --> 22:30.447
This unnecessary business
of running for senate,

22:30.450 --> 22:33.684

that very oath.

22:33.686 --> 22:35.770
As senator, mrs. Grant

by their mamas and daddies

That marriage is not just
the cornerstone of the family

But of the nation, as well.

39:17.722 --> 39:19.722
When i am a senator,
i'll come home every night

39:19.725 --> 39:21.791
And talk to the president
about my day,

39:21.793 --> 39:24.894
Just like he comes home
every night and talks to me.

39:24.896 --> 39:26.830
And, like any married couple,

39:26.832 --> 39:30.700
We're gonna do what we can
to help each other out.

of her work.

The spin to end all spin.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.141
It is,
and it'll probably work.

40:11.143 --> 40:13.943
Mellie will probably
get elected, and then...

40:13.945 --> 40:16.646
Every minute of time either one
of us has worked

40:16.648 --> 40:18.114
For this man
and his legacy

40:18.116 --> 40:19.682
Goes right down the drain

40:19.684 --> 40:21.684
Because all
he'll be remembered for

40:21.686 --> 40:23.887
Is his wife telling
the world he's whipped.

40:23.889 --> 40:27.957
It's all any of us will be
remembered for, so...

40:27.959 --> 40:32.629
Enjoy this job
while it lasts, red.

Yes. She told me.

40:44.476 --> 40:46.042
Ballard is in the hospital.

40:46.044 --> 40:48.912
It irritates me to know
that he's still breathing.

Should i finish the job?

40:50.582 --> 40:52.949
The job has changed, son.

We're looking ahead,

Onward and upward.

Foxtail?
Yes, we initiate foxtail.

40:58.190 --> 41:00.023
Keep me abreast
of my daughter's movements.

I got to confess, olivia.
It's been pretty crazy.

I couldn't figure it out.

How did my dad know
about the russians?

42:03.822 --> 42:05.955
And then i realized
it was you.

42:05.957 --> 42:08.958
You were there.
You were sent to kill jake.
