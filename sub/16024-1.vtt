01:28.792 --> 01:30.840
Come on.

01:52.042 --> 01:54.090
Oh! Fuck it!

01:58.958 --> 02:01.006
Do you want me to have a go?

02:02.375 --> 02:04.423
I can go down on you if you like.

02:06.625 --> 02:08.673
I don't think that'll help.

02:11.583 --> 02:15.417
Where are you? Anyone home?

02:22.375 --> 02:24.878
Get your fucking hands off me.
I'm going, alright?

02:24.875 --> 02:27.469
- Tom?
OK. This is Tom Keaton.

02:27.458 --> 02:29.256
32 years old. White Caucasian male.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.753
He's got severe lacerations to his face
and abdomen.

02:31.750 --> 02:33.969
- What have we got?
- Extensive blood loss.

02:33.958 --> 02:35.801
Blood pressure's 105 over 50.

02:35.792 --> 02:38.261
Hurry.
I don't want him bleeding to death.

02:38.250 --> 02:41.049
I've notified the burns unit.
- Stay with us, mate.

02:41.042 --> 02:43.090
Where's all this blood coming from?
Stop.

02:43.083 --> 02:44.676
How long has he been unconscious?

02:44.667 --> 02:46.715
Since we cut him
out of his car.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.678
Get a fucking move on!
You gonna go or what?

02:52.042 --> 02:56.673
Retards! Everyone just...

02:57.833 --> 02:59.927
Come on, you fucking dick!

03:05.917 --> 03:09.876
Truly unbelievable!
Must be fucking crazy!

03:09.875 --> 03:12.424
- Maybe you need to see a therapist.
- Don't!

03:14.125 --> 03:15.627
Right. Mussels going in.

03:15.625 --> 03:18.299
- Darren, those vegetables ready?
Yes, chef.

03:18.292 --> 03:21.466
Right, take that salmon out.
Get me a peach tart and a soufï¬‚Ã© on six.

03:21.458 --> 03:24.302
I'm going to need that tuna
coz my liver's now getting cold.

03:24.292 --> 03:26.090
Coming right up.

03:26.083 --> 03:28.381
You selfish fucking arsehole!

04:48.875 --> 04:52.550
I indicated right and turned left.

05:15.167 --> 05:17.590
You're alive.

05:17.583 --> 05:21.042
Doesn't feel like it.

05:21.042 --> 05:23.465
How's the hand?

05:27.583 --> 05:28.675
Better

05:30.292 --> 05:35.002
- You're a natural healer.
- I told you I'd look after you.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.844
I think I'm going to need
some ongoing treatment.

05:39.917 --> 05:45.754
Um... Last night... was a freebie. OK?

05:45.750 --> 05:49.254
I was very drunk and you were very kind.

05:50.625 --> 05:52.969
If you'd like to see me again...

05:59.042 --> 06:01.136
Salon Kitty Kat.

06:04.250 --> 06:09.552
As a rule,
I don't entertain in my home. OK?

06:21.958 --> 06:25.792
Give me a fucking break, will you? Prick!

06:27.875 --> 06:29.923
No, Karen. Not you.

06:29.917 --> 06:33.342
Do I sound like I'm in a kitchen?

06:33.333 --> 06:35.882
Karen, would you just listen to me?

06:35.875 --> 06:38.549
I said I'll be there,
so I'll be there. Alright?

06:38.542 --> 06:42.172
Yes, I know how important it is.

06:42.167 --> 06:43.760
Scotch and T-bones.

06:43.750 --> 06:46.469
I'm also going to need
a couple of kilos of calf's liver.

06:46.458 --> 06:47.801
What are you talking about?

06:49.458 --> 06:52.211
Look, I thought we had a deal, Karen.

06:52.208 --> 06:54.711
Out of the way!
Yes, I made a mistake.

06:54.708 --> 06:56.881
I messed up the time.
Let's just move on.

06:56.875 --> 07:00.334
Well, why are you still giving me shit about it?

07:02.167 --> 07:04.545
You know what?
If it's gonna make you feel better,

07:04.542 --> 07:06.670
I'll hand back
my 'parent of the year' title.

07:06.667 --> 07:08.169
Yeah! Why...

07:08.167 --> 07:11.216
Why don't I just do it all?

07:13.792 --> 07:17.092
Yeah, I'm here.
I'm buying it right now.

07:17.083 --> 07:19.632
- Allan.
How are you, Tom?

07:19.625 --> 07:22.834
It's not gonna kill you to do the menus
when I get back, Sally.

07:22.833 --> 07:27.418
Of course, I know what time it is! Just...
Fuck off!

07:27.417 --> 07:32.048
What the fuck am I gonna need?

07:33.833 --> 07:37.087
What? Karen.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.676
Can I get two whole salmon,

07:39.667 --> 07:42.216
ten kilos of the mussels,
ten kilos of the baby clams?

07:42.208 --> 07:45.337
Sure.
- I'm at the fish market.

07:45.333 --> 07:48.587
Because I fucked up the ordering.
Nice, ten kilos of those as well.

08:10.250 --> 08:11.547
Tom?

08:13.292 --> 08:14.885
You can go in now.

08:21.708 --> 08:23.255
Karen, I gotta go.

08:28.500 --> 08:31.094
Right. Mains on 12.
Darren, those vegetables ready?

08:31.083 --> 08:32.130
Yes, chef.

08:32.125 --> 08:35.174
Luke, there's food waiting.
EntrÃ©es away, table 9.

08:35.167 --> 08:38.376
And a lamb, a poussin asparagus on 5,
and a feuillete of berries on 4.

08:38.375 --> 08:40.503
Get it together, Steve.
Out of the way, move.

08:40.500 --> 08:42.092
How are those vegetables on 12?

08:42.082 --> 08:44.336
Need two bok choy, parsley purÃ©e
and beef on 7.

08:44.333 --> 08:47.086
Yes, chef.
A couple of snappers for 11.

08:47.083 --> 08:49.506
Compliments of table 8.
They sent you this.

08:49.500 --> 08:52.549
Table 3's away.
- Pretentious cunts!

08:52.542 --> 08:54.920
Man on table 7
wants his duck cooked longer.

08:54.917 --> 08:56.464
Fuck off!

08:57.458 --> 09:00.302
Cooked pink, like it says in the menu.
Did you tell him that?

09:00.292 --> 09:02.215
- I told him.
- What's his problem then?

09:02.208 --> 09:04.757
- It's too rare for him.
- Tell him to go to Red Rooster!

09:04.750 --> 09:06.423
That's how we cook it, Dickhead!

09:07.458 --> 09:09.131
Cheers, mate.

09:11.167 --> 09:12.714
Well, that is delicious.

09:12.708 --> 09:15.552
- Pretentious cunts with taste.
He doesn't want it.

09:15.542 --> 09:18.341
Give it here!
He says it's not cooked properly.

09:18.333 --> 09:21.462
Right. Put on new vegetables, Chris.
Do me another demi, Darren.

09:21.458 --> 09:24.541
Fuckin' idiot!

09:53.833 --> 09:55.085
Plate!

10:11.833 --> 10:14.757
Never forget, Luke,
the customer's always right.

10:21.500 --> 10:22.968
Bon appÃ©tit.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.544
I'd better go sort out tomorrow.

10:28.833 --> 10:30.756
You want me to do the ordering?

10:30.750 --> 10:34.254
It's Friday.
You'd better get some extra fish.

11:11.500 --> 11:15.130
Oh, God!

11:19.708 --> 11:25.090
Oh, God! Oh,
God! Oh! Oh!

11:25.083 --> 11:27.711
Shit!

11:27.708 --> 11:30.791
Oscar, stop screaming.

11:30.792 --> 11:32.715
- OK.
What the hell!

11:32.708 --> 11:33.960
Hey, what's wrong?

11:33.958 --> 11:36.586
I can't sleep.
I had a nightmare.

11:36.583 --> 11:38.836
Can you come?

11:38.833 --> 11:41.837
- Go on, hop back in.
- You have a son?

11:41.833 --> 11:47.260
- Dad? There's someone in your bed.
- Oh, shit!

11:47.250 --> 11:50.333
Come on, I'll tuck you in.
This is unbelievable!

11:50.333 --> 11:52.802
Say hello to Miriam.
What the hell...

11:52.792 --> 11:55.671
Who's she?
Back to bed.

11:55.667 --> 11:57.510
I don't like her.

12:16.667 --> 12:19.796
Nah, he's not. About 11:30. Thanks.

12:20.917 --> 12:22.919
- Mr Keaton?
- Sorry, I'm late.

12:22.917 --> 12:25.466
Peter Gardiner, Welan Realty.
We spoke on the phone.

12:25.458 --> 12:28.052
- Tom.
- Carol Wentworth. Nice to meet you.

12:28.042 --> 12:30.170
What a beautiful home
you have here.

12:30.167 --> 12:32.215
- Thanks.
You lived here long?

12:32.208 --> 12:35.212
- A while.
- Yeah? Time for a change?

12:35.208 --> 12:37.882
Something like that.

12:38.875 --> 12:42.334
- So, shall we go in?
- Yeah.

12:42.333 --> 12:45.963
Look, you guys go ahead.
Here's the keys. Take a look around.

12:45.958 --> 12:48.177
Oh! Sorry, Tom... We can't...

12:48.167 --> 12:51.922
We're not able to go in
unaccompanied by the owner.

12:51.917 --> 12:53.885
Do you want to sell the house or not?

12:58.375 --> 13:01.174
What about pasta?
Nah.

13:01.167 --> 13:03.261
Chicken?
Nah!

13:03.250 --> 13:05.093
Sausages then.
Nah.

13:05.083 --> 13:07.256
Stop saying 'nah'.
I want pizza.

13:07.250 --> 13:10.504
You're not having pizza again
for dinner. What about lasagne?

13:10.500 --> 13:12.753
Nah! I'm sick of that shit.
- What then?

13:12.750 --> 13:15.754
I don't know, you're the chef.
- Where'd you get that from?

13:16.958 --> 13:19.632
Just take it off!
You leave my things alone!

13:19.625 --> 13:21.753
OK!

13:38.458 --> 13:40.131
I'm sorry.

13:42.583 --> 13:44.677
I just want you to eat
some proper dinner.

13:44.667 --> 13:46.795
Doesn't matter. I was bad.

13:46.792 --> 13:51.047
You weren't bad. No-one was bad.
Dad was bad.

13:54.042 --> 13:55.589
Wanna hear something funny?

13:57.458 --> 14:00.587
- It's a pretty good joke.
- No.

14:00.583 --> 14:03.553
I think you'll like it. You get to say 'penis'.

14:09.458 --> 14:12.132
How long do we have to stay
in that crappy motel?

14:12.125 --> 14:14.093
Come on, mate. It's getting cold.

14:22.500 --> 14:25.128
Why does Mum call it 'pitza'?

14:25.125 --> 14:28.459
- 'Pitza'?
- It's pizza.

15:02.292 --> 15:05.842
Tom? I can see you.

15:08.417 --> 15:11.216
I just had his teacher on the phone.
Why isn't he in school?

15:11.208 --> 15:12.926
Well, we didn't quite make it.

15:12.917 --> 15:15.090
Dad can't do everything.

15:15.083 --> 15:19.008
Remind me again, which one of you two
is the eight-year-old?

15:19.000 --> 15:21.879
Come on, sweetheart. Get your gear.
You've got rehearsals.

15:21.875 --> 15:23.752
I'm not going.

15:24.750 --> 15:27.629
Get a fucking move on!

15:29.125 --> 15:31.924
- Dickhead!
- Hey! Come on.

15:31.917 --> 15:36.172
- You do it.
- Yeah, but I'm trying not to.

15:36.167 --> 15:37.885
Not very hard.

15:54.875 --> 15:57.298
Dad?
What?

15:57.292 --> 15:58.965
I want to stay with you.

15:58.958 --> 16:05.876
- You do stay with me... most of the time.
Not since my party.

16:11.458 --> 16:13.301
Come on, quickly. We've got lots to do.

16:13.292 --> 16:16.876
- When are all the kids gonna come?
- I told you, half an hour.

16:16.875 --> 16:19.003
Why didn't you invite them earlier?

16:19.000 --> 16:21.924
Stop complaining, Os,
or I swear to God I'm going home.

16:21.917 --> 16:24.591
Oh! Party sucks!

16:24.583 --> 16:27.462
- That's it! Forget it. Party's cancelled.
- Get out, mate!

16:32.167 --> 16:33.885
Sony, mate.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.635
Aargh!

16:43.000 --> 16:47.005
Happy birthday, mate.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.718
You think it's funny, do you?

16:50.792 --> 16:54.751
Let's all have a picnic! Chicken?
Yes, please!

16:54.750 --> 16:58.630
Salad? Lovely. Fuckin' jam rolls!

17:00.958 --> 17:02.676
Fuckin' game of rugby!

17:02.667 --> 17:05.546
Have a sit-down over there!

17:13.333 --> 17:17.041
Fuckin' move! Fuckin'...

17:19.083 --> 17:21.256
Are you out of your mind?

17:21.250 --> 17:23.423
Hasn't he been through enough?

17:23.416 --> 17:26.465
- Dad?
- Is it funny now?

17:27.791 --> 17:32.673
It was his birthday party, for Chrissakes!
How fuckin' hard can that be?

17:44.375 --> 17:46.002
Are you really up for this?

17:46.000 --> 17:48.799
- I can cope.
- Cope?

17:48.792 --> 17:54.549
This is what you call coping? Jesus Christ!
I just got you both out of jail!

17:57.167 --> 18:00.011
Oh! Ha-ha! Very funny.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.502
He's just a little boy...

18:09.208 --> 18:12.963
...who desperately needs you
to behave like his father.

18:15.083 --> 18:17.461
Not some hooligan.

18:25.292 --> 18:28.626
Don't you think it would be easier
if he came to live with me for a while?

18:28.625 --> 18:31.344
- No, I want him with me.
- It's not about you, Tom.

18:44.667 --> 18:47.090
You need to think
about what's best for him.

18:57.958 --> 19:01.258
Tom? ls everything alright?

19:02.417 --> 19:04.886
Are you serious?
We're having a family dinner.

19:04.875 --> 19:05.967
Who is it?

19:05.958 --> 19:08.962
You want me to serve up?
- Yeah, serve. I'll be right there.

19:08.958 --> 19:11.177
Sorry.
This probably wasn't such a good idea.

19:12.583 --> 19:14.460
Lisa, it's on the table.

19:14.458 --> 19:16.961
- Don't let it get cold.
- OK, call me.

19:37.417 --> 19:40.500
Can I get a rum and coke,
a vodka tonic,

19:40.500 --> 19:43.504
and a couple of disgusting
fizzy fruit things?

19:45.292 --> 19:49.877
I thought chefs were rich.
Why don't you have a better car?

20:02.250 --> 20:03.593
No!

20:06.083 --> 20:08.211
Is Dad selling the house?

20:11.500 --> 20:13.673
You selfish, fucking arsehole!

20:13.667 --> 20:17.501
I turn up with Oscar to pick up a few
of his things and you're selling the house?

20:17.500 --> 20:20.709
Just get off my fucking back,
will you? I'm struggling here.

20:20.708 --> 20:24.008
We're all fucking struggling, Tom!

20:39.250 --> 20:45.178
Tom? It's pretty late, mate.
Oscar's asleep, Karen's exhausted.

20:47.167 --> 20:50.626
- What happened to your hand?
- I burnt it.

20:53.292 --> 20:57.718
Tom, I know how hard all this is for you.

20:57.708 --> 21:00.382
But can't you see it's getting
too much for Karen?

21:00.375 --> 21:03.675
She needs to get on with her life,
and she can't, not properly,

21:03.667 --> 21:06.170
not while you keep making
all these demands of her.

21:06.167 --> 21:10.297
I think, Graham, when it all gets
too much, she can tell me herself.

21:10.292 --> 21:13.626
No, Tom... You don't get it.

21:13.625 --> 21:15.593
This is not up for discussion.

21:15.583 --> 21:19.087
I'm telling you, just back off,
and give her a break. Alright?

21:22.292 --> 21:23.794
Don't touch me.

22:31.542 --> 22:35.001
Kick it here.
A gorgonzola and pear soufï¬‚Ã©.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.594
Flash-fried harbour prawns
with a saffron aioli.

22:37.583 --> 22:39.130
Flash-fried.

22:39.125 --> 22:41.674
And half a lobster
with a lime cream.

22:41.667 --> 22:44.967
Caviar sauce, which is fucking delicious.

22:44.958 --> 22:46.835
Tom.

22:46.833 --> 22:48.551
Yeah.
It's the school.

22:48.542 --> 22:51.170
Oh! watch out, Sally!

22:51.167 --> 22:52.259
Fuck it!

22:52.250 --> 22:56.175
Oh! And a ceviche kingfish.
Ceviche what?

23:03.792 --> 23:05.510
Sorry, mate. Come on.

23:06.792 --> 23:08.419
- Mum's here.
What?

23:08.417 --> 23:09.760
Mum's here.

23:20.542 --> 23:21.759
Tom?

23:23.208 --> 23:26.291
Tom Keaton. It's me, Brian.

23:26.292 --> 23:30.377
Fuckin' prick! Haven't seen you in ages.

23:31.500 --> 23:33.719
Oh! We've missed you, mate.

23:33.708 --> 23:37.383
I've been leaving messages
on your phone for months.

23:37.375 --> 23:39.469
So... how you been?

23:41.167 --> 23:44.592
- Good.
- What's happening?

23:54.667 --> 23:57.716
Hello. You must be Oscar.

23:58.750 --> 24:02.425
- It wasn't my dad's fault.
- I'm sure it wasn't.

24:03.792 --> 24:06.295
- How old are you, Oscar?
- Eight.

24:06.292 --> 24:08.670
- I just turned eight.
- Wow!

24:09.750 --> 24:13.334
What have you got there?
Aren't you gonna open them?

24:16.958 --> 24:19.677
Listen, sweetie. We're gonna have
to give your mum a call

24:19.667 --> 24:21.590
and get her to come pick you up.

24:21.583 --> 24:24.587
I want to wait for my dad.

24:24.583 --> 24:28.258
Well, unfortunately, he might have
to stay here for a little while.

24:30.792 --> 24:33.671
She doesn't have a phone anymore.

24:36.500 --> 24:39.344
Well, she must be somewhere
we can contact her.

24:52.208 --> 24:53.425
Hello?

24:59.375 --> 25:01.423
Oscar? What are you doing?

25:02.542 --> 25:04.089
Ah! Miss Cameron.

25:09.125 --> 25:10.593
You know what, fuck them!

25:10.583 --> 25:13.177
It's a fish.
It tastes better cooked with its head on.

25:13.167 --> 25:15.966
Nobody wants to eat a meal
when it's still looking.

25:15.958 --> 25:19.588
- It's disgusting. How's that special?
- It is special. I fuckin' cooked it.

25:19.583 --> 25:22.336
Just 'cause he's gonna end up
on someone's dinner plate,

25:22.333 --> 25:24.711
poached with a champagne
and sorrel beurre blanc,

25:24.708 --> 25:27.302
doesn't mean he shouldn't do it
with a bit of dignity.

25:27.292 --> 25:30.922
Which is pretty bloody impossible
if we cut his fuckin' head off.

25:30.917 --> 25:34.967
- Tom, you need to call Sarah.
- Why should I?

25:34.958 --> 25:37.211
You need to call her.

25:40.917 --> 25:42.214
Hello.

25:43.625 --> 25:46.629
Where are you? Anyone home?

26:17.708 --> 26:19.506
Hey!

26:19.500 --> 26:25.792
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

26:25.792 --> 26:29.751
Oh! Sh! Everything's gonna be OK.

26:34.458 --> 26:36.552
I'm glad you were with her.

26:40.042 --> 26:42.215
Bullshit!

27:15.958 --> 27:17.050
Tom?

27:20.125 --> 27:22.173
You can go in now.

27:29.958 --> 27:31.801
Karen, I gotta go.

28:26.958 --> 28:30.417
My dad is very sad.

28:34.667 --> 28:36.795
Is there someone else that we can call?

28:39.625 --> 28:43.880
- I sometimes stay with my aunty.
- What's your aunty's name?

28:43.875 --> 28:48.051
- Karen.
- Shall we give Aunty Karen a call?

28:53.458 --> 28:55.426
It's not much of a birthday, is it?

29:45.083 --> 29:47.381
Tuna steaks go alright on the barbecue?

29:49.500 --> 29:51.093
Not if you're the tuna.

30:02.417 --> 30:05.921
Jesus Christ!

30:09.042 --> 30:11.090
Do you always drive like that?

30:14.250 --> 30:17.254
You know you're welcome.
Vic would love to see you.

30:17.250 --> 30:22.256
Just sear it quickly. There's nothing
fuckin' worse than overcooked tuna.

30:31.792 --> 30:35.251
You know, when we gave up...
trying to get pregnant...

30:36.333 --> 30:38.006
...Vic was really devastated.

30:39.917 --> 30:43.091
It was a mutual decision,
but she hated me for it.

30:44.917 --> 30:47.340
Sarah was so good to Vicky.

30:49.083 --> 30:52.462
So kind. So compassionate.

30:55.333 --> 30:57.085
We owe her a lot.

31:00.875 --> 31:03.424
For a while there
I didn't think we were gonna make it.

31:07.792 --> 31:09.465
I know it was cut short...

31:12.500 --> 31:14.047
...but you were lucky, mate.

31:21.917 --> 31:24.340
You fuckin' call us.

31:32.208 --> 31:34.586
Come on, dickhead!

31:57.333 --> 31:59.051
Fuck you!

32:02.125 --> 32:05.834
Will you fuck off, you impatient prick?

32:25.500 --> 32:27.173
Who's there?

32:30.125 --> 32:32.048
What do you want?

32:46.917 --> 32:49.887
Hi, you've called Sarah, Tom and...

32:49.875 --> 32:51.502
Oscar.

32:56.708 --> 33:00.793
- Hi, you've called Sarah, Tom and...
Oscar.

33:00.792 --> 33:04.877
Sorry none of us are here to take
your call right now, but please...

33:04.875 --> 33:06.468
Now?

33:06.458 --> 33:09.302
Leave me a message.

33:09.292 --> 33:11.465
Thanks for calling. Bye.

33:13.083 --> 33:15.552
Hello.
This is a message for Tom Keaton.

33:15.542 --> 33:19.001
It's Kathryn Dent
from the Prince of Wales Hospital.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.174
I have an urgent personal matter
I need to discuss with...

33:22.167 --> 33:25.376
Hello. Speaking.

33:28.542 --> 33:30.135
What about the rest of her?

33:31.792 --> 33:34.636
I'm sorry, but all her organs
were compromised

33:34.625 --> 33:36.423
once the cancer was in her body.

33:37.625 --> 33:41.209
Her retinas are the only tissue
we can use with absolute safety.

33:42.417 --> 33:45.261
She was worth more than that.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.755
Tom, there's a very sick patient
up on our sixth floor.

33:52.833 --> 33:54.426
They're a diabetic.

33:55.583 --> 33:59.542
The diabetes caused them to go blind
about three years ago.

34:02.125 --> 34:05.174
This patient is about to undergo
pancreatic surgery

34:05.167 --> 34:08.137
which, hopefully, will save their life.

34:09.292 --> 34:15.425
We can use Sarah's retinas
to help restore their eyesight.

34:16.417 --> 34:18.293
What could be worth more than that?

34:22.042 --> 34:24.340
Look, I know the timing is terrible...

34:25.417 --> 34:27.795
...but we need to collect them
as soon as possible,

34:27.792 --> 34:30.261
before the tissue starts to break down.

34:30.250 --> 34:32.594
It's a very simple procedure.

34:34.375 --> 34:37.583
The surgeon
would remove her retinas...

34:37.583 --> 34:39.335
Cut her eyes.

34:41.250 --> 34:42.877
To disfigure her like that.

34:45.958 --> 34:48.802
Tom, I promise you,
there'll be no disfigurement.

34:50.292 --> 34:55.172
The surgeon would close Sarah's eyelids
in a very natural way.

34:56.542 --> 35:00.376
You'd still be able to have an open coffin
at her funeral, if that was your wish.

35:00.375 --> 35:01.797
Excuse me?

35:01.792 --> 35:03.840
Where's the patient
that was in that bed?

35:03.833 --> 35:06.211
- Can I help you, please?
- No, no! Where are they?

35:07.208 --> 35:08.835
It's your decision, Tom.

35:14.708 --> 35:17.086
She fought so hard...

35:20.958 --> 35:24.713
You can only imagine what it's like for
a mother to leave her child behind.

35:29.875 --> 35:36.167
She had the most beautiful...
almond-shaped eyes.

35:38.833 --> 35:41.427
She also had the best-looking arse
in Australia.

35:44.208 --> 35:46.006
Shame no-one can use that.

35:59.500 --> 36:01.548
He's just running
15 minutes late.

36:01.542 --> 36:04.170
Just grab a seat
and hopefully it won't be too long.

36:56.125 --> 36:57.422
Oh!

37:02.833 --> 37:04.631
Oh!

37:16.500 --> 37:18.127
Sarah Keaton?

37:25.458 --> 37:28.792
Right, two mussels.

37:28.792 --> 37:32.171
- One risotto. Darren, how's your quail?
Another two minutes.

37:32.167 --> 37:34.215
One liver, one chicken, one tuna away on 7.

37:34.208 --> 37:36.506
Six people booked for 9:30.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.844
Alright. See you then.
- Sally, Sally.

37:40.833 --> 37:44.167
Wait for me.
Our first night and we're almost full.

37:44.167 --> 37:45.760
Fuckin' hell!

37:45.750 --> 37:48.424
- Cheers, Sal.
Cheers.

37:48.417 --> 37:51.842
Everybody, well done.
One down, one million to go.

37:55.292 --> 37:58.171
- One langoustine, one crab, one lobster.
Yes, chef!

37:58.167 --> 38:02.001
Right. Mussels are on.

38:03.333 --> 38:04.960
Another one?

38:04.958 --> 38:07.052
Allee-oop!

38:15.250 --> 38:17.048
No, it was freezing.

38:17.042 --> 38:20.797
We were collecting
these beautiful big mussels.

38:20.792 --> 38:26.959
Then this huge wave crashed into
the rocks and washed us into the ocean.

38:26.958 --> 38:30.792
- Did Dad swear?
- No, of course not!

38:30.792 --> 38:32.419
Not your dad.

38:34.125 --> 38:37.299
So, we were way out,
bobbing up and down,

38:37.292 --> 38:39.545
being pushed under
by this massive swell.

38:39.542 --> 38:41.965
I didn't even know
if I could hold my breath.

38:41.958 --> 38:47.510
And suddenly...
I felt something underneath me,

38:47.500 --> 38:51.175
pushing me up,
pushing me through the water.

38:51.167 --> 38:54.967
I was gasping for air
and then I saw your dad too.

38:54.958 --> 38:59.759
And it was Louie...
lifting us with his claws.

39:01.167 --> 39:06.003
And then, he just held us there...
hovering above the water.

39:08.667 --> 39:14.003
And then he swooshed his tail
and we ï¬‚ew out over the waves,

39:14.000 --> 39:19.211
and over the rocks,
and we landed safely on this little beach.

39:41.958 --> 39:44.711
Oi! Less drinking, more cleaning.

39:44.708 --> 39:47.177
What? You got me pissed,
now hurry up with the food.

39:50.958 --> 39:53.427
Alright, Luke. Away on 3.

39:53.417 --> 39:55.670
The lamb and mussels, right?

39:55.667 --> 39:56.964
Right.

40:11.667 --> 40:14.136
Fucking yum!

40:23.208 --> 40:24.960
There you go, mate.

40:24.958 --> 40:27.381
Is this my dinner?

40:27.375 --> 40:31.084
Alright, that's her. Just be cool. Alright?

40:33.000 --> 40:35.594
Hi. Come in.

40:37.542 --> 40:41.843
- Oh! Hello.
- Dad has to piss off.

40:41.833 --> 40:44.052
Thank you.

40:44.042 --> 40:46.010
Yeah. I got to pop out for an hour or so.

40:46.000 --> 40:49.425
You couldn't just hang with him
for a while, till I get back. Could you?

40:49.417 --> 40:51.966
Alright, you.
Behave yourself.

40:55.833 --> 40:58.803
- She shouldn't be too much longer.
- Hm.

41:05.333 --> 41:07.461
Come on, Tom. We're going for a drink.

41:13.417 --> 41:16.011
So, here's the thing, Tom.

41:16.000 --> 41:20.176
I barely know you, but I suspect that
you're nowhere near ready to confront

41:20.167 --> 41:22.716
what it is that you're
dealing with at the moment.

41:24.042 --> 41:30.095
And your interest in seeing me is,
shall we say, less than therapeutic.

41:31.083 --> 41:34.758
Are you suggesting that there's some
sort of an attraction going on here?

41:35.958 --> 41:40.668
Yeah. We're attracted to each other.

41:40.667 --> 41:45.753
And you are attracted to
pretty much everybody at the moment.

41:47.875 --> 41:50.719
To be honest?
- Please.

41:53.167 --> 41:55.295
I prefer to fuck you than talk to you.

41:55.292 --> 41:59.547
Jesus! Don't hold back the charm
on my account.

41:59.542 --> 42:02.512
Sorry, that was the grief speaking.

42:10.792 --> 42:12.510
I'm not that easy.

42:20.542 --> 42:22.419
But... you can call me.

42:25.958 --> 42:29.838
I need fresh strawberries,
raspberries, red and black currants.

42:29.833 --> 42:32.461
Fresh, as in they were once growing.
Alright?

42:32.458 --> 42:35.177
Tom. We're in the champagne room.

42:35.167 --> 42:38.091
I won't be a minute.
I've just got to get rid of all this stuff.

42:38.083 --> 42:41.508
The asparagus was limp yesterday.
None of that shit from cold storage.

42:41.500 --> 42:44.003
But I'll take two dozen bunches
if it's new season,

42:44.000 --> 42:46.844
six of beetroot and I'm gonna need
six bunches of leeks

42:46.833 --> 42:48.801
and some of that organic garlic.

42:48.792 --> 42:49.884
Tom?

42:54.083 --> 42:55.881
I can't cook to save myself.

42:57.833 --> 42:59.460
How do I look?

43:00.708 --> 43:02.426
Sarah Keaton?

43:10.542 --> 43:13.625
So, how are we today?

43:35.333 --> 43:37.131
What? What's wrong?

43:39.917 --> 43:41.009
Tom.

43:42.625 --> 43:44.627
Where are you going?

43:53.042 --> 43:54.635
- Hm!
- Ow.

43:54.625 --> 43:56.172
Another one.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.877
And another.

44:05.875 --> 44:08.128
So, what do you think?

44:08.125 --> 44:10.378
What do I think about what?

44:12.833 --> 44:14.255
You know...

44:17.208 --> 44:21.133
- I want to have another child.
Can't we get a dog?

44:21.125 --> 44:24.379
- Wouldn't you like a brother or a sister?
- What about a guinea pig?

44:24.375 --> 44:29.381
- We'll see.
- Oh! You always say 'We'll see'.

44:29.375 --> 44:31.343
Everyone else has got a pet.

44:33.042 --> 44:34.259
What do you think?

44:40.458 --> 44:42.381
Are we good enough parents?

44:44.667 --> 44:46.635
I don't know.

44:50.292 --> 44:52.090
Does it make you happy?

44:53.958 --> 44:56.336
Does it make you happy?

45:02.833 --> 45:06.167
I only want you to do it
if it makes you happy too.

45:11.625 --> 45:13.218
It makes me happy.

45:13.208 --> 45:15.006
Tom!

45:15.000 --> 45:18.129
The last six months
all you talked about was remission, OK?

45:18.125 --> 45:21.254
Remission, remission.
Today, you didn't mention it once.

45:22.250 --> 45:24.628
Six months ago,
we all hoped we'd caught it early.

45:24.625 --> 45:27.799
Six months ago, we hoped she'd be
more responsive to her treatment.

45:27.792 --> 45:30.671
Six months ago, we weren't dealing
with a secondary cancer

45:30.667 --> 45:32.761
on her hip and shoulder.

45:32.750 --> 45:36.175
Six months ago, we had
a lot more options than we do today.

45:37.667 --> 45:40.591
You and Sarah need to decide
what you want to do.

45:40.583 --> 45:44.338
I'm sorry, Tom,
but we're a long way past remission.

45:44.333 --> 45:47.667
This is about prolonging
whatever life Sarah has left.

45:49.417 --> 45:50.509
Tom?

45:55.667 --> 45:57.385
She wants to have another baby.

46:06.375 --> 46:09.959
- What's that?
- What are you... what are you doing?

46:09.958 --> 46:14.293
- That.
- Oh! So close! What?

46:18.875 --> 46:21.845
God! It's nothing!
Get on with it.

46:37.625 --> 46:40.469
It must be wonderful
to cook like that for people.

46:40.458 --> 46:43.883
You think so, do you?
- Mm.

46:43.875 --> 46:47.175
I'd rather cook it
and throw it straight in the bin.

46:47.167 --> 46:50.501
Let me tell you, people are at their worst
when they go to a restaurant.

46:50.500 --> 46:53.583
What about me? I've got to dress up
and put on wigs for a living.

46:53.583 --> 46:57.338
You got it easy. You've only got
to fuck 'em. I gotta feed 'em.

46:57.333 --> 47:02.510
And time's up, Tom.

47:02.500 --> 47:04.798
Did you want to extend?

47:05.792 --> 47:07.760
No, thanks.

47:07.750 --> 47:10.549
I was supposed to be at work
an hour ago.

47:10.542 --> 47:12.465
Oh!

47:20.708 --> 47:25.589
Does that help?
- No, not really.

47:29.667 --> 47:31.510
Did she have curly hair?

47:34.167 --> 47:35.259
Yeah.

47:35.250 --> 47:38.424
Call security.

47:40.333 --> 47:43.382
- Tom. Tom!
- They died. That patient died!

47:43.375 --> 47:45.048
Which patient?

47:45.042 --> 47:47.044
You promised me.
You came into our house.

47:47.042 --> 47:48.794
What are you talking about?

47:48.792 --> 47:51.295
- You gave them to a dead man.
- You need to calm down.

47:51.292 --> 47:53.465
Who died?
- She gave you her eyes.

47:54.708 --> 47:56.335
Who's there?

47:57.417 --> 47:58.885
What do you want?

48:03.042 --> 48:06.672
Please... leave me alone.

48:09.958 --> 48:11.175
Please.

48:23.583 --> 48:26.507
Oi! Thank you.

48:34.958 --> 48:36.426
Piss off!

48:43.625 --> 48:46.048
Hi, Lisa. It's Tom Keaton.

48:46.042 --> 48:50.172
Yeah, good, thanks. I just thought
I might take you up on your kind offer.

48:52.792 --> 48:56.751
A coffee? Sounds great.

49:02.625 --> 49:05.629
We just had it done. Oh, yes! There!

49:05.625 --> 49:10.085
The marble's Italian. We had it shipped
in a single piece and cut to size.

49:10.083 --> 49:12.302
Oh! Tom, don't stop!

49:14.125 --> 49:18.255
I love to cook,
but it's got to be fresh and organic.

49:18.250 --> 49:21.424
Oh! I wanted a cool room.

49:27.042 --> 49:30.592
Leave it! Oh! Yes!
Wait for me!

49:42.667 --> 49:44.761
Don't stop. I want you to finish.

49:49.292 --> 49:51.044
Don't worry about me, I'm fine.

49:54.458 --> 49:56.677
It's completely understandable.

49:58.250 --> 50:00.127
It's gonna take a while.

50:01.708 --> 50:03.881
Let me up, I need the bathroom.

50:05.333 --> 50:10.669
Oh! Don't move. I'll be right back.
I made us some lunch.

50:10.667 --> 50:12.044
I'm so glad you called.

50:12.042 --> 50:13.965
Hello, Mr Keaton.

50:13.958 --> 50:16.006
It's Carol Wentworth from Welan Realty...

50:16.000 --> 50:20.801
It's so hard. When my aunt passed away,
it was overwhelming...

50:20.792 --> 50:25.423
You know what, Tom?
I am a very good listener.

50:25.417 --> 50:28.546
So, what did you think of Miriam?

50:29.625 --> 50:30.717
Who?

50:43.292 --> 50:46.466
I... Tom?

50:48.792 --> 50:51.215
- Hello.
- How you doing, mate?

50:51.208 --> 50:55.759
- Hey! We're so sorry, Tom.
- We haven't seen you in ages.

50:55.750 --> 50:57.548
- You alright?
- Good to see you out.

50:57.542 --> 51:01.092
- How you going, you poor thing?
We all miss her so much.

51:02.083 --> 51:03.460
Thank you.

51:05.167 --> 51:08.216
Oh! Tom, this is Miriam. Miriam, Tom.

51:08.208 --> 51:11.257
- Oh! Ouch! Ow! Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

51:11.250 --> 51:13.719
- Miriam's a therapist.
- Lisa.

51:13.708 --> 51:15.756
- Jesus Christ!
- Who does that?

51:15.750 --> 51:19.254
It's OK, don't worry.
I'm sure you're also a very nice person.

51:19.250 --> 51:25.087
Hm. Well, I'm starving. Shall we leave Tom
in peace and find our table?

51:25.083 --> 51:26.756
Or you could join us.

51:27.750 --> 51:30.754
Good idea.
- Yeah, I think you should. Absolutely.

51:30.750 --> 51:32.502
Why don't you?
- Um...

51:32.500 --> 51:35.549
I can't believe this.
You guys do this to me all the time.

51:35.542 --> 51:39.172
Tom, no of fence, but it's my birthday
I thought it could just be us for once.

51:39.167 --> 51:40.669
You go ahead. No of fence at all.

51:40.667 --> 51:43.136
- We can pop a chair on the end of the table.
- Maybe...

51:43.125 --> 51:45.378
No. I was just on my way.
Cheque, please.

51:45.453 --> 51:49.128
Next time, when your therapist
doesn't hog you all to herself.

51:49.120 --> 51:51.293
Well, it's good to see you out again, Tom.

51:51.286 --> 51:54.836
Yeah, thanks. I'm sorry... I was...
I was just leaving. So...

51:55.828 --> 51:57.501
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

52:02.578 --> 52:04.706
- What?
- Jesus!

52:05.703 --> 52:07.580
- Jesus!
Tom?

52:08.578 --> 52:10.455
Lisa. Look, I've really got to go.

52:10.453 --> 52:13.787
Tom, I won't keep you, I promise.
I just wanted to say...

52:13.786 --> 52:18.371
If you ever need anything...
I don't know... someone to talk to,

52:18.370 --> 52:21.499
or some help...
please, I want you to call me.

52:22.953 --> 52:24.876
If there's anything I can do.

52:29.286 --> 52:30.378
Anything.

52:36.745 --> 52:38.418
Promise me.

52:39.953 --> 52:41.045
Sure.

52:45.620 --> 52:47.372
Call me.

52:48.495 --> 52:50.213
I mean it, Tom.

52:51.203 --> 52:52.750
We all miss her so much.

52:59.911 --> 53:02.130
Mum's here.

53:02.120 --> 53:03.212
What?

53:05.203 --> 53:07.001
Mum's here.

53:13.370 --> 53:14.542
Babe.

53:17.578 --> 53:20.252
Come. Go on.

53:26.911 --> 53:28.458
What are you doing?

53:36.453 --> 53:38.581
I can't fucking drive!

53:45.245 --> 53:47.122
- I need you to be here.
- I am here.

53:47.120 --> 53:48.918
Not just when you can fit me in!

53:48.911 --> 53:52.085
How dare you say that to me!
I'm working my arse off, for fuck's sake!

53:52.078 --> 53:56.288
While you get to lie around all day
enjoying the benefits of having cancer.

54:07.745 --> 54:09.998
Oh! Come here.

54:11.495 --> 54:14.999
Wrap your arms around me,
you fucking idiot.

54:17.495 --> 54:19.213
Squeeze it out of me.

54:23.745 --> 54:25.418
Now fuck me.

54:27.370 --> 54:30.670
And don't stop till it's all gone.

54:32.453 --> 54:33.545
Wait.

54:37.745 --> 54:40.248
I think a blow job's a cure for cancer.

55:28.703 --> 55:30.580
Do you think I'm gonna die?

55:32.036 --> 55:33.583
What? No.

55:36.495 --> 55:39.704
I think you're gonna kill me
before you ever get the chance.

55:48.370 --> 55:50.839
- If I die...
Ssh! Come on.

55:50.828 --> 55:53.877
No, really. Listen to me.

55:57.953 --> 55:59.705
If I die...

56:03.328 --> 56:06.707
...when it's your turn,
will you come and find me?

56:11.411 --> 56:14.620
If you die,
I'm never fucking speaking to you again.

59:11.745 --> 59:16.000
It's ours, we got it.
I'm picking up the keys on Monday.

59:18.411 --> 59:20.288
Oi!

59:21.286 --> 59:25.291
Sorry. We just got our restaurant.

59:27.328 --> 59:29.501
What? Are you a waiter?

59:30.745 --> 59:32.372
Dishwasher.

59:34.786 --> 59:37.084
I can't cook to save myself.

01:00:02.536 --> 01:00:06.336
Parsnip purée and the beef on 7.

01:00:06.328 --> 01:00:09.628
Can I get some lemon zest
and segments, some parsley, please.

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:12.920
Any chance of those mains on 6
actually coming out in my lifetime?

01:00:15.786 --> 01:00:16.878
Fuck!

01:00:19.286 --> 01:00:21.334
Ah!

01:00:40.661 --> 01:00:42.584
- Tom!
- Fuck!

01:00:52.536 --> 01:00:53.628
Hey!

01:00:55.453 --> 01:00:56.545
Hello.

01:00:58.495 --> 01:01:01.544
You there!

01:01:01.536 --> 01:01:03.254
Mr Man!

01:01:05.745 --> 01:01:07.543
Aren't you gonna talk to me?

01:01:09.661 --> 01:01:12.164
Oh! What's that on your hand?

01:01:12.161 --> 01:01:16.792
Ooh, I love a man
with his arm bandaged.

01:01:16.786 --> 01:01:23.704
Makes you look so vulnerable and sexy.

01:01:23.703 --> 01:01:27.128
You think?

01:01:30.453 --> 01:01:34.037
Is it...
Does it really hurt?

01:01:36.286 --> 01:01:40.496
It's such a turn-on...

01:01:40.495 --> 01:01:43.954
Oh! I'm a nurse, you know.

01:01:45.453 --> 01:01:49.458
I could look after you.

01:01:51.078 --> 01:01:53.422
Fuckin' hell!

01:01:55.745 --> 01:01:57.463
Phew!

01:01:58.495 --> 01:02:00.122
Are you alright?

01:02:01.495 --> 01:02:04.169
Whoa-whoo!

01:02:05.245 --> 01:02:07.794
- Come on, sit up here.
- Ooh!

01:02:08.786 --> 01:02:12.996
- And have a drink.
- Yes, I need a drink.

01:02:16.078 --> 01:02:18.456
Ch!

01:02:20.245 --> 01:02:22.794
You're too fucking high!
I could've hurt myself.

01:02:23.995 --> 01:02:25.668
Ah! Jesus!

01:02:27.786 --> 01:02:28.878
Oh!

01:02:30.703 --> 01:02:32.080
What are we celebrating?

01:02:33.453 --> 01:02:35.626
Cheers, baby.

01:02:37.036 --> 01:02:38.333
Cheers.

01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:43.373
Fuckin' hell!

01:02:45.286 --> 01:02:46.378
Hey!

01:02:47.953 --> 01:02:51.628
What you doin'?
Nothing.

01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:54.089
What's wrong?

01:02:56.286 --> 01:02:59.005
Nothing, I'm OK.

01:02:58.995 --> 01:03:03.956
- How was work?
Babe, you're doing so well.

01:03:05.453 --> 01:03:07.251
Everything's gonna be OK.

01:03:16.078 --> 01:03:18.206
So much has happened.

01:03:20.953 --> 01:03:22.876
Everything's changed.

01:03:25.661 --> 01:03:29.211
I don't know if I can go on like before.

01:03:30.911 --> 01:03:32.788
I don't know if I want to.

01:03:36.245 --> 01:03:38.122
What are you saying?

01:03:42.203 --> 01:03:45.332
I don't know. I'm not saying anything.
I'm just...

01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:55.296
I just don't know if things can...
be the same.

01:03:59.411 --> 01:04:02.130
If we'll even be together...

01:04:03.245 --> 01:04:05.088
...and it makes me sad.

01:04:13.578 --> 01:04:18.630
Dad?

01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:21.419
Dad, are you awake?

01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:25.122
No, I'm sleeping.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:28.090
Something outside
keeps making a noise.

01:04:29.828 --> 01:04:31.580
Don't listen to it.

01:04:33.578 --> 01:04:38.505
Can I get into your bed?

01:04:38.495 --> 01:04:41.339
OK, hop in. But I want you to go
straight back to sleep.

01:04:46.495 --> 01:04:48.497
Stop wriggling.

01:04:55.453 --> 01:05:00.004
Dad? Did Mum know
she was going to die?

01:05:07.786 --> 01:05:08.878
No.

01:05:11.703 --> 01:05:15.458
She did everything she could to stay with us,
but she was just too sick.

01:05:18.911 --> 01:05:21.164
F-word cancer.

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:25.463
F-word cancer.

01:05:27.745 --> 01:05:30.498
F-word, F-word, F-word cancer.

01:05:35.036 --> 01:05:36.788
Can I say it once?

01:05:38.328 --> 01:05:40.080
OK, just once.

01:05:42.411 --> 01:05:44.038
Fucking cancer!

01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:51.543
OK, settle down now.

01:05:56.953 --> 01:06:01.538
Dad? Do you think Mum's with Louie?

01:06:03.995 --> 01:06:05.292
Maybe.

01:06:13.786 --> 01:06:17.836
Mussels? Just get some garlic, parsley, chilli.
Done, that's all you need.

01:06:20.245 --> 01:06:21.963
Excuse me, sailor.

01:06:26.078 --> 01:06:28.877
- Be delicious with some of that lobster.
- No!

01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:35.162
You leave Louis alone.
I have a much nicer treat for you later.

01:07:00.078 --> 01:07:04.458
I indicated right and turned left.

01:07:09.953 --> 01:07:12.001
Look at you!

01:07:11.995 --> 01:07:15.249
What a clever mummy!

01:07:16.495 --> 01:07:22.832
So fuckin' clever.
Fuckin', fuckin' clever!

01:07:22.828 --> 01:07:26.332
Dad?
- What?

01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:34.673
Is it true that sometimes a man
puts his penis inside a woman's vagina?

01:07:46.495 --> 01:07:49.669
I got tuna, mussels, lobsters
and a dozen whiting.

01:07:49.661 --> 01:07:53.666
No, it's all here in the hospital.
Well, fuck! You'll have to come and get it.

01:07:59.828 --> 01:08:01.922
ls there a fridge in here that I can use?

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:04.209
Oh! Tell that restaurant to fuck off!

01:08:04.203 --> 01:08:07.582
I gotta go. Yeah, yeah, she's doing great.
Says hello.

01:08:07.578 --> 01:08:10.912
- Bloody dishwasher quit.
- Piss off! Piss off!

01:08:10.911 --> 01:08:12.913
Oh!

01:08:12.911 --> 01:08:17.621
That's it. Great-looking arse, babe.

01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:19.792
Shut up!

01:08:19.786 --> 01:08:22.915
Ssh!

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:28.542
Can you come
and put me to sleep now?

01:08:44.411 --> 01:08:45.879
Are you OK?

01:08:48.745 --> 01:08:51.953
We're ?at out busy, I know
the kitchen could really do with a hand.

01:08:53.370 --> 01:08:55.919
We've decided
not to continue the chemo.

01:08:55.911 --> 01:08:58.130
She wants to try and deal with it
in her own way.

01:09:02.036 --> 01:09:03.629
What do you think?

01:09:07.786 --> 01:09:09.880
Who's fighting?

01:09:12.786 --> 01:09:16.370
No-one, sweetheart. Aunty Karen's here
just having some dinner with us.

01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:18.042
You woke me up.

01:09:18.036 --> 01:09:20.710
We're finished now.
Come on, let's get you back into bed.

01:09:20.703 --> 01:09:24.787
This is exactly why
I didn't want you to tell anybody!

01:09:24.786 --> 01:09:26.913
What did Dad tell?
Nothing.

01:09:28.328 --> 01:09:29.625
I'm her sister!

01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:32.624
Well, apparently when you're faced with
your own mortality,

01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:34.497
you get to do whatever the fuck you like.

01:09:34.495 --> 01:09:36.747
I know you don't agree with this.

01:09:36.745 --> 01:09:40.328
Of course I don't fucking agree with it.
She should be in hospital.

01:09:42.078 --> 01:09:43.955
The treatment's not working.

01:09:47.495 --> 01:09:49.714
It's down there.
Where?

01:09:49.703 --> 01:09:51.296
Look.
Where?

01:09:51.286 --> 01:09:52.832
Right. I'm going in.

01:09:52.828 --> 01:09:56.253
Are you sure it was for tonight?
For three people?

01:09:57.620 --> 01:10:00.749
I'll check again.
I don't have a booking in that name.

01:10:00.745 --> 01:10:04.704
Get that pork on the plate.
With who?

01:10:04.703 --> 01:10:08.788
Just plating up the pork
and lamb now. How's that lobster?

01:10:08.786 --> 01:10:11.790
Oh, my God! He's so beautiful!

01:10:11.786 --> 01:10:14.130
He's so delicious.
What are you talking about?

01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:15.588
No, don't kill him. No!

01:10:15.578 --> 01:10:17.580
Please don't kill him.

01:10:38.370 --> 01:10:40.714
Mm! Fucking yum!

01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:45.874
- So what's the sum?
- Can't you just tell me?

01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:48.999
No, I can't. I don't need to do
your homework, thanks very much.

01:10:48.995 --> 01:10:50.747
All the other parents do.

01:10:50.745 --> 01:10:53.498
Yeah, well,
I'm not all the other parents, am I?

01:10:53.495 --> 01:10:56.749
Aren't you supposed to be
handing that in tomorrow?

01:10:56.745 --> 01:11:00.249
Doesn't having a relative with cancer
mean you don't have to?

01:11:00.245 --> 01:11:02.714
No, it doesn't!
That's not fair.

01:11:02.703 --> 01:11:05.331
Os, this is giving me the total shits, mate.

01:11:05.328 --> 01:11:07.751
If you want my help,
you can sit up and concentrate,

01:11:07.745 --> 01:11:12.376
and having a relative with cancer
makes no difference to your homework. Alright?

01:11:12.370 --> 01:11:15.544
- It's very upsetting
- Mm-hm.

01:11:16.661 --> 01:11:18.413
Mum!

01:11:18.411 --> 01:11:21.790
Hey! How did it go?
Dinner's nearly ready.

01:11:22.786 --> 01:11:26.290
Oh, I'm not hungry.
I just want to go upstairs.

01:11:33.786 --> 01:11:35.379
No! Oh! No! Stop it!

01:11:35.370 --> 01:11:37.714
You can't just come in like that.
Get off the bed!

01:11:37.703 --> 01:11:39.922
Hey! It's OK. He's OK.
He just wants to see you.

01:11:39.911 --> 01:11:41.959
Why do you let him do that?

01:11:41.953 --> 01:11:45.287
Hey, Mum's OK.
Go and say goodnight.

01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:50.204
Go on... give her a hug.

01:11:51.995 --> 01:11:53.087
Gently.

01:11:54.286 --> 01:11:58.792
- Goodnight, Mum.
- Goodnight, gorgeous boy.

01:12:04.245 --> 01:12:05.337
You go and hop into bed

01:12:05.328 --> 01:12:09.037
and I'll come and read Pesky Mouse
in a funny voice, OK?

01:12:09.036 --> 01:12:10.959
Why is Mum angry with me?

01:12:10.953 --> 01:12:15.709
Mum's not angry. Mum's just cross
'cause she's not feeling very well.

01:12:15.703 --> 01:12:18.001
She's not angry with you,
sweetheart. OK?

01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:21.463
I'll be down in a minute.

01:12:26.286 --> 01:12:28.789
- I know. I'm sorry.
- You can't do that to him!

01:12:28.786 --> 01:12:32.086
He's barely seen you in weeks!
You're either meditating or asleep.

01:12:32.078 --> 01:12:35.082
I don't give a shit how bad you feel.
You can't do that to him!

01:12:35.078 --> 01:12:39.663
I'm sorry. Tell him I'm sorry.

01:12:48.078 --> 01:12:49.625
He made you this card.

01:12:56.078 --> 01:12:58.456
I'm in so much pain.

01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:17.964
- Excuse me?
- Where's the patient from that bed?

01:13:17.953 --> 01:13:20.297
- Can I help you, please?
- No, no! Where are they?

01:13:20.286 --> 01:13:24.211
- I need you to keep your voice down.
- He died... a couple of nights ago.

01:13:24.203 --> 01:13:26.797
- What do you mean he died?
- Are you a family member?

01:13:28.578 --> 01:13:32.412
Sir? Sir? Call security!

01:13:32.411 --> 01:13:34.914
Get your fuckin' hands off me!
I'm going, alright?

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:36.037
Tom?

01:13:37.661 --> 01:13:40.915
Listen to me, no-one died.

01:13:42.453 --> 01:13:47.630
I'm sorry, Tom. You know I can't tell you
who received Sarah's eyes.

01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:50.954
- You mean 'won't'.
- OK. Won't.

01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:54.464
Sarah was a registered donor.

01:13:54.453 --> 01:13:57.206
Surely this was something
that she wanted to do.

01:14:00.661 --> 01:14:03.414
Why did you agree to stop
her treatment so early?

01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:07.419
That was a decision
both you and Sarah made.

01:14:09.161 --> 01:14:10.788
That was her decision.

01:14:14.786 --> 01:14:16.629
Tom, I found it difficult as well.

01:14:17.786 --> 01:14:20.835
I think it took a great deal of courage
to stand by the way you did -

01:14:20.828 --> 01:14:24.082
to let her deal with her illness
in her own way,

01:14:24.078 --> 01:14:26.172
to accept the decisions that she made.

01:14:26.161 --> 01:14:30.120
Yeah... well...

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:32.919
I've fucking changed my mind, haven't I?

01:14:35.703 --> 01:14:39.753
I've got nothing but respect
for what both you and Sarah did.

01:14:43.495 --> 01:14:47.420
I... I can... I can't do this.

01:14:47.411 --> 01:14:51.962
Yes, you can.
You'll be more comfortable in hospital.

01:14:51.953 --> 01:14:55.412
You fucking arsehole!

01:14:55.411 --> 01:14:58.210
'More comfortable' for you!

01:15:06.786 --> 01:15:08.413
I'm scared.

01:15:10.245 --> 01:15:13.419
If I go to the hospital,
I won't come home again.

01:15:14.745 --> 01:15:18.045
Babe, I promise you,
as soon as we sort out the pain,

01:15:18.036 --> 01:15:19.663
I'll bring you straight home.

01:15:19.661 --> 01:15:23.837
- OK?
- I don't want to die.

01:15:23.828 --> 01:15:25.546
I promise you.

01:15:27.911 --> 01:15:29.538
Come on.

01:15:29.536 --> 01:15:31.664
- Ooh!
- That's it.

01:15:33.411 --> 01:15:35.254
Let me just get around the corner.

01:15:39.411 --> 01:15:40.958
OK, just one more.

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:46.713
Good girl!

01:15:52.328 --> 01:15:53.875
Come on.

01:16:00.245 --> 01:16:01.918
Oh! Did you get my make-up bag?

01:16:01.911 --> 01:16:03.584
- No, not yet.
- I asked you to get it.

01:16:03.578 --> 01:16:05.546
- I'll get it in a minute.
- No, get it now!

01:16:05.536 --> 01:16:07.209
I can't do it all!

01:16:07.203 --> 01:16:10.662
If you let me get a fuckin' ambulance,
I can remember everything you need!

01:16:10.661 --> 01:16:13.164
Let me just get you in the car
and then I'll go get it.

01:16:13.161 --> 01:16:15.914
No, get it now. You'll forget.

01:16:15.911 --> 01:16:19.711
- What are you doing? You go.
- Alright!

01:16:19.703 --> 01:16:23.583
I'll be fine. I'm OK down the hall.
l need it

01:16:23.578 --> 01:16:25.546
Just be careful.

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:30.542
- You OK?
- Yep.

01:16:30.536 --> 01:16:34.541
OK. Fuck! Fuckin' fuck!

01:16:43.828 --> 01:16:47.162
Where the fuck is it?

01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:13.997
Tom, help me.

01:17:13.995 --> 01:17:16.373
Wait a minute.
Where the fuck is it?

01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:18.668
Fuck!
- Tom.

01:17:18.661 --> 01:17:22.211
- Tom!
I'm coming!

01:17:30.370 --> 01:17:32.418
Do you think you can climb over it?

01:17:44.245 --> 01:17:46.543
- Bad suitcase!
- Don't. Don't.

01:18:00.578 --> 01:18:03.457
Promise me you'll bring me home.

01:18:06.953 --> 01:18:08.546
Come on.

01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:32.169
Tom, what do you mean
you didn't write it in the book?

01:18:32.161 --> 01:18:34.960
- There's food waiting here!
- Remember that rule we have?

01:18:34.953 --> 01:18:37.251
'Every booking
must be written in the book'.

01:18:37.245 --> 01:18:39.589
Ring a bell?
It should, it's your fucking rule!

01:18:39.578 --> 01:18:42.127
It was written on a piece of paper
that was on the book!

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:44.589
- That's not 'in' the book!
- Give me a fuckin' break!

01:18:44.578 --> 01:18:46.546
- Where's the lobster?
- Lobster's off.

01:18:46.536 --> 01:18:48.538
- What's that?
- Just fuck off, he's sick!

01:18:50.286 --> 01:18:52.630
Tom, stop. Don't tell me this.

01:18:53.953 --> 01:18:56.797
You slept with me, that's it.
You don't get to play patient.

01:18:57.786 --> 01:18:59.914
I sleep with people I cook for
all the time.

01:19:05.078 --> 01:19:07.251
No matter how hard you try to resist...

01:19:08.536 --> 01:19:10.914
...grief is not something
that you can ignore.

01:19:12.370 --> 01:19:16.546
Be careful that you don't go so far out
that you can't find your way back.

01:19:17.786 --> 01:19:19.459
What if I don't want to get back?

01:19:26.828 --> 01:19:29.172
Dad, you said you'd play!

01:21:00.495 --> 01:21:03.954
I need coffee. Strong.

01:21:03.953 --> 01:21:05.955
With one sugar.

01:21:13.786 --> 01:21:16.164
Heat the milk and froth it up a bit.

01:21:18.745 --> 01:21:20.622
Please, chef.

01:21:26.828 --> 01:21:28.421
What the...?!

01:21:33.953 --> 01:21:35.045
Empty-

01:21:36.661 --> 01:21:39.665
What? He escaped?

01:22:04.328 --> 01:22:07.787
Funny, I don't remember
booking a 2:30 wake-up call.

01:22:22.911 --> 01:22:24.959
Do you want some spaghetti
or something?

01:22:27.745 --> 01:22:32.251
Surprisingly... we ate dinner...

01:22:32.245 --> 01:22:34.464
...at dinnertime.

01:22:45.995 --> 01:22:48.748
I feel like I hardly got to see her
the last couple of years.

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:52.713
Was she happy?

01:22:56.536 --> 01:22:57.628
Yeah.

01:23:04.161 --> 01:23:06.334
You know
we were trying to get pregnant?

01:23:07.995 --> 01:23:09.087
No.

01:23:11.536 --> 01:23:13.163
I didn't know that.

01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:21.546
She never told me anything.

01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:31.340
We were thinking about
living in New York for a year.

01:23:36.411 --> 01:23:37.503
Ah!

01:23:44.536 --> 01:23:46.254
I was always so jealous of her...

01:23:47.786 --> 01:23:49.584
...cause, you know, I love to travel,

01:23:49.578 --> 01:23:52.548
and she always got to go
to all the really great places.

01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:59.420
Yeah, well, she's gone
to a cracker of a place now.

01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:32.499
There's something
I have to tell you about Mum.

01:24:32.495 --> 01:24:33.587
Tom?

01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:37.838
Your son is here.

01:24:44.245 --> 01:24:46.919
Something that might happen
in the next few days.

01:24:51.536 --> 01:24:53.504
Os, are you listening to me?

01:25:02.370 --> 01:25:06.750
- You know how sick Mum's been?
- She's getting better.

01:25:08.536 --> 01:25:11.039
Yeah. Well, we all really hope
that she will get better,

01:25:11.036 --> 01:25:14.085
but what's making her sick
won't go away.

01:25:16.578 --> 01:25:18.956
The doctors have done
a really great job.

01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:23.498
But they've tried everything
that they can.

01:25:25.661 --> 01:25:30.337
And... it's not definite...

01:25:31.745 --> 01:25:37.423
...but they think in the next few days,
Mum's... probably gonna die.

01:25:39.370 --> 01:25:40.997
So... it's not a definite.

01:25:40.995 --> 01:25:43.214
No, mate. I...

01:25:44.786 --> 01:25:47.380
The doctors think it's a definite.
I'm sorry.

01:25:47.370 --> 01:25:50.214
Fuckin' dickhead doctors!
They're fuckin' idiots!

01:25:50.203 --> 01:25:53.958
What do they fuckin' know about her?
She isn't gonna die!

01:25:53.953 --> 01:25:56.877
I fuckin' hate those dickheads
at the hospital!

01:25:56.870 --> 01:26:00.500
They're fuckin' dickheads!
Fuckin' dickheads!

01:26:00.495 --> 01:26:04.545
I hate you!
I fuckin' hate you!

01:26:04.536 --> 01:26:08.962
I hate you!

01:27:06.703 --> 01:27:08.626
Someone... Nurse?

01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:24.838
There isn't much time.

01:27:27.911 --> 01:27:31.245
Not yet... please.

01:27:37.078 --> 01:27:40.958
I'm here.

01:27:48.203 --> 01:27:49.921
I love you, baby.

01:28:22.411 --> 01:28:24.334
I'll come and find you.

01:28:55.536 --> 01:29:01.498
She's gone.
I'm very sorry for your loss.

01:29:01.495 --> 01:29:03.293
No!

01:29:38.286 --> 01:29:41.665
That's it? No personal service?
You just want to masturbate over me?

01:29:44.203 --> 01:29:48.379
Make it 150, but I want to slide my top down
if you're gonna cum on my tits.

01:29:57.786 --> 01:29:59.288
How's your aim?

01:30:02.661 --> 01:30:04.629
Come on.

01:30:13.370 --> 01:30:15.168
Fuck it!

01:30:17.370 --> 01:30:19.372
Do you want me to have a go?

01:30:20.370 --> 01:30:22.543
I can go down on you if you like.

01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:29.749
Sorry, I just can't do this anymore.

01:30:36.245 --> 01:30:37.997
Thank you.

01:30:59.203 --> 01:31:02.286
Karen, would you just listen to me?

01:31:02.286 --> 01:31:05.665
I said I'll be there,
so I'll be there. Alright?

01:31:05.661 --> 01:31:08.130
Yes, I know it's important.

01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:16.418
She's three.

01:31:22.411 --> 01:31:24.584
My son just turned eight.

01:31:28.078 --> 01:31:32.163
Come on, sweetheart. It's time to go.

01:31:33.995 --> 01:31:36.623
- You forgot your offal.
- Oh, fuck! Thanks, mate.

01:31:55.828 --> 01:31:57.956
Come on, you fuckin' dick!

01:32:40.661 --> 01:32:43.210
I indicated right and turned left.

01:32:51.370 --> 01:32:53.919
This is Tom Keaton,
32 years old.

01:32:53.911 --> 01:32:57.586
White Caucasian male with severe
lacerations on his face and abdomen.

01:32:57.578 --> 01:32:58.875
What have we got?

01:32:58.870 --> 01:33:02.170
There's been extensive blood loss.
His blood pressure's 105 over 50.

01:33:02.161 --> 01:33:04.209
Hurry, I don't want him
bleeding to death.

01:33:04.203 --> 01:33:06.706
- I've notified the burns unit.
- Stay with us, mate.

01:33:06.703 --> 01:33:09.456
Where's all this blood coming from?
Stop. Give us a hand.

01:33:09.453 --> 01:33:11.455
How long has he been unconscious?

01:33:11.453 --> 01:33:13.455
Since we cut him out of his car.

01:33:13.453 --> 01:33:14.545
Jesus!

01:33:20.495 --> 01:33:22.247
It's liver.

01:33:23.786 --> 01:33:26.414
There's no way
it's at 84 beats a minute.

01:33:32.370 --> 01:33:33.997
Kidneys.

01:33:33.995 --> 01:33:37.204
He's in shock but there's no sign
of trauma. He's... Oh!

01:33:37.203 --> 01:33:43.040
Jeez!
- It's a rack of lamb!

01:33:48.661 --> 01:33:50.379
He's out cold.

01:33:50.370 --> 01:33:53.670
But apart from a few cuts, I don't think
there's anything wrong with him.

01:34:53.911 --> 01:34:56.881
Oh! I'm sorry.

01:34:57.870 --> 01:35:02.455
My sister's pregnant.
She's having a baby.

01:35:04.703 --> 01:35:06.751
What day is it?

01:35:55.411 --> 01:36:00.417
Wonderful! Alright, next up,
we have Oscar Keaton.

01:36:00.411 --> 01:36:03.005
Come on, Oscar.
- Yay!

01:36:06.370 --> 01:36:09.214
Alright, what are you gonna do
for us today, Oscar?

01:36:09.203 --> 01:36:11.547
Trumpet. Right.

01:36:54.245 --> 01:36:56.714
Thank you.

01:36:57.703 --> 01:36:59.751
Thank you, Oscar.

01:37:10.203 --> 01:37:11.250
Um...

01:37:13.203 --> 01:37:14.750
You alright?

01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:19.667
Um...

01:37:22.536 --> 01:37:25.164
Why are pirates called 'pirates'?

01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:31.204
- Why are pirates called 'pirates'?
Why?

01:37:32.203 --> 01:37:36.333
They just 'aarrrh'!

01:37:40.370 --> 01:37:43.340
What's brown and sticky?

01:37:44.745 --> 01:37:49.205
What?
- A stick.

01:37:53.995 --> 01:37:59.673
My dad told me this one, did you
hear about the man with five penises?

01:38:03.870 --> 01:38:06.589
His underpants fitted him like a glove.

01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:15.668
My dad told me that one.

01:38:15.661 --> 01:38:19.086
He thinks it's a really good joke
'cause you get to say 'penis'.

01:38:19.078 --> 01:38:21.297
Alright. Thank you, Oscar.

01:39:00.911 --> 01:39:03.005
Are you sure?

01:39:06.286 --> 01:39:09.586
Are you coming?
I want to.

01:39:09.578 --> 01:39:11.330
Alright then, off you go.

01:39:19.286 --> 01:39:20.333
Oi!

01:39:25.495 --> 01:39:29.420
You call me any time you want.
Alright? Any time.

01:39:32.703 --> 01:39:34.250
Come on, give me a hand.

01:39:36.786 --> 01:39:37.833
Watch out.

01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:40.622
Good boy.

01:40:10.911 --> 01:40:12.538
Look at all my things!

01:40:53.953 --> 01:40:57.378
Dad, I'm hungry. What do we have?

01:41:04.328 --> 01:41:05.921
Not much.

01:44:01.828 --> 01:44:03.956
You know you got your mother's eyes?

01:44:05.036 --> 01:44:06.663
What are you making me?

01:44:13.036 --> 01:44:14.788
How about a 'pitza'?

01:44:19.995 --> 01:44:22.123
# Instant karma's gonna get you

01:44:23.703 --> 01:44:25.831
# Gonna knock you right in the head

01:44:27.411 --> 01:44:29.755
# You better get yourself together

01:44:31.161 --> 01:44:33.710
# Pretty soon you're gonna be dead

01:44:36.078 --> 01:44:38.797
# What in the world you thinkin' of

01:44:39.870 --> 01:44:42.248
# Laughin' in the face of love

01:44:43.703 --> 01:44:45.922
# What on earth you tryin' to do

01:44:47.078 --> 01:44:50.332
# It's up to you, yeah, you

01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:54.088
# Instant karma's gonna get you

01:44:55.578 --> 01:44:57.876
# Gonna look you right in the face

01:44:59.745 --> 01:45:02.089
# Better get yourself together, darling

01:45:03.953 --> 01:45:05.546
# Join the human race

01:45:07.870 --> 01:45:09.918
# How in the world are you gonna see

01:45:11.620 --> 01:45:13.918
# Laughing at fools like me

01:45:15.828 --> 01:45:18.832
# Who on earth do you think you are?

01:45:18.828 --> 01:45:22.833
# A superstar? Well, right you are

01:45:22.828 --> 01:45:26.753
# Well, we all shine on

01:45:26.745 --> 01:45:30.625
# Like the moon and the stars
and the sun

01:45:30.620 --> 01:45:34.579
# Well, we all shine on

01:45:35.578 --> 01:45:38.832
# Everyone, come on

01:45:40.036 --> 01:45:42.084
# Instant karma's gonna get you

01:45:43.620 --> 01:45:45.293
# Gonna knock you off your feet

01:45:47.411 --> 01:45:49.880
# Better recognise your brothers

01:45:51.328 --> 01:45:53.080
# Everyone you meet

01:45:55.245 --> 01:45:57.794
# Why in the world are we here?

01:45:59.495 --> 01:46:01.793
# Surely not to live in pain and fear

01:46:03.411 --> 01:46:05.630
# Why on earth are you there?

01:46:06.620 --> 01:46:08.372
# When you're everywhere

01:46:08.370 --> 01:46:10.247
# Gonna get your share

01:46:10.245 --> 01:46:14.045
# But we all shine on

01:46:14.036 --> 01:46:18.041
# Like the moon and the stars
and the sun

01:46:18.036 --> 01:46:22.041
# Yeah, we all shine on

01:46:22.036 --> 01:46:26.121
# Come on and on and on, on, on

01:46:27.661 --> 01:46:29.208
# Yeah, yeah

01:46:30.661 --> 01:46:32.288
I Alright

01:46:34.245 --> 01:46:36.293
# Uh-huh

01:46:38.536 --> 01:46:39.583
#Ah!

01:46:42.870 --> 01:46:46.670
# Well, we all shine on

01:46:46.661 --> 01:46:50.541
