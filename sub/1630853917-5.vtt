WEBVTT

00:41.542 --> 00:44.044
Sorry. We're from--
-I know who you are.

00:44.044 --> 00:48.090
Last but not least.
We interviewed all of your sisters.

00:48.090 --> 00:50.050
Yeah. I know.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.677
Can we come in?
-No.

00:51.677 --> 00:53.345
We just have a few questions.

00:53.345 --> 00:55.514
I don't like unexpected callers.

00:55.514 --> 00:57.182
I thought your sisters would've told you.

00:57.266 --> 00:58.684
Have my sisters got your schedule?

00:58.684 --> 01:01.520
Would you like us to schedule--
-No. But, yeah, we're here now, Matt.

01:01.520 --> 01:02.604
Yeah.

01:13.407 --> 01:14.908
Keep yours on.

01:17.035 --> 01:18.787
It's a really handsome space.

01:24.126 --> 01:25.127
Wow.

01:26.712 --> 01:28.797
Well, somebody's a good shot.
-Yeah, I am.

02:44.206 --> 02:46.583
Must be tricky. With the...

02:46.667 --> 02:47.709
No.

02:47.793 --> 02:51.380
So, we just have one or two questions
about the accident.

02:52.840 --> 02:56.969
Which one? The crash that killed
my parents or the one where I lost my eye?

02:57.761 --> 03:02.057
The latter. Although, yours was a bit more
than a fender bender outside a hotel.

03:02.057 --> 03:05.686
Sorry. It must be hard--
-However, I mean, it ruined your life.

03:06.687 --> 03:09.606
Funny enough, no.
Losing an eye is just losing an eye.

03:10.440 --> 03:14.236
Humans are adaptable.
Sometimes I forget completely.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.447
So you didn't blame John Paul?
-No.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.908
Well, he blamed you
on his insurance claim form.

03:19.992 --> 03:21.618
Yeah, we put it behind us.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.954
I had my eye, he had his hole in his head.

03:23.954 --> 03:27.457
It can't be easy,
having your brain exposed like that.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.376
Even Stephens.

03:31.503 --> 03:36.258
I have just seen Mary Tracey
having a sneaky fag behind her shed

03:36.258 --> 03:38.844
in a Christmas dressing gown.

03:38.844 --> 03:41.263
The old shrew is human after all.

03:41.763 --> 03:46.852
Hello. I'm Nora, Bibi's wife.

03:46.852 --> 03:48.145
How are you?
-How are you?

03:48.645 --> 03:50.856
Did you get tea or coffee?

03:52.399 --> 03:55.068
No.
-No? Do you want tea or coffee?

03:55.152 --> 03:56.695
No.
-Yes, please.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.282
Are you from a church?

04:01.158 --> 04:02.492
What church?

04:03.410 --> 04:05.037
No. We're from Claffin Insurance.

04:05.037 --> 04:06.955
I'm Matt and this is Thomas.

04:07.039 --> 04:10.125
Right. Now that I have you here
in front of me, I can ask you straight.

04:10.209 --> 04:13.504
When are you going to pay Gracie?
That poor woman has suffered enough.

04:13.504 --> 04:16.173
We're making sure everything lines up.
-Lines up how?

04:16.255 --> 04:18.425
You draw a line from that man
in any direction,

04:18.509 --> 04:19.927
and you'll find nothing but misery.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.846
Look at Bibi.
He ruined her life in an instant.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.641
Just to tickle his sadistic streak.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.520
And worst still, he refused
to take any responsibility for it.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.939
No, in his head, it was all Bibi.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.274
He said once, when I challenged him--
-How do you take your coffee?

04:34.358 --> 04:35.442
What did he say?

04:36.818 --> 04:37.819
How do you take it?

04:38.654 --> 04:40.030
One sugar, little milk.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.199
What was I saying?
-John Paul.

04:42.199 --> 04:48.080
Oh, yes. Yeah. He said,
"You know what she's like.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.415
She can go off anytime without warning."

04:50.499 --> 04:55.838
And I said, "Her screaming at you to stop,
should've rung some alarm bells."

04:56.547 --> 04:58.090
And you know what he said?

04:58.632 --> 05:03.053
He said, "I stopped listening
to those Garvey girls years ago.

05:03.887 --> 05:06.265
'Cause they're always screaming
about something."

05:06.849 --> 05:10.227
How she sat at the same table as him,
is beyond me.

05:10.227 --> 05:12.312
She is a better woman than I am.

05:13.230 --> 05:17.442
I won't lie, I felt like punching him
every time I saw him.

05:21.196 --> 05:22.698
<i>Hola!</i>
-<i>Hola!</i>

05:22.698 --> 05:23.824
<i>Hola, chicas.</i>

05:24.366 --> 05:25.492
Hello again, Becka.

05:26.702 --> 05:30.080
Hi. Good to see you.
-Hey. How are you?

05:30.080 --> 05:31.790
We've taken up enough time.

05:33.417 --> 05:34.585
That's fair play.

05:35.586 --> 05:37.296
That's loads of goals.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.382
Bye, Rubs.
-Bye.

05:40.382 --> 05:41.884
You're welcome, my dear.

05:42.509 --> 05:43.594
See you next time.

05:43.594 --> 05:45.762
Good doing business with ya.
-See you.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.682
Oh, my God. Becka.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.684
"Oh, my God" what? What happened?

05:51.476 --> 05:52.769
You happened.

05:53.937 --> 05:57.065
You need to throw that fish
back in the sea and let him swim far away.

05:57.149 --> 05:58.692
I know, I know.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.321
I didn't know who he was, I swear.

06:02.321 --> 06:05.199
When did you even-- Does Eva know?

06:05.199 --> 06:07.910
No. And please, please don't tell her.
I'm begging you.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.995
Promise me you won't see him again.

06:12.331 --> 06:14.416
Swear to me. Say it aloud.

06:14.416 --> 06:15.584
I swear.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.295
Oh, my God.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.007
Would you stop stealing people's rubbish?

06:22.007 --> 06:24.551
Stop lying to yourself. Don't you remember
the tagline from that movie?

06:24.635 --> 06:26.678
Stop, Tom.
-"Never let her out of your sight.

06:26.762 --> 06:28.805
Never relax on duty."

06:28.889 --> 06:30.599
What?
-"Never fall in love."

06:30.599 --> 06:33.101
I'm not, all right?
That door is well closed.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.687
Didn't look closed there.

06:42.361 --> 06:44.112
How's my favorite beach ball?

06:45.405 --> 06:46.240
What?

06:50.410 --> 06:51.578
I should've been here.

06:51.662 --> 06:53.288
Blood pressure's gone down slightly.

06:53.372 --> 06:56.875
Slightly? But it's supposed to be
less than 120 over 80.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.379
Was there protein in her urine?
-I haven't checked her urine.

07:00.379 --> 07:02.005
Okay. I think you should check her urine.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.174
Maybe we should take your blood pressure.

07:04.258 --> 07:05.801
Odds are, it's higher than mine.

07:05.801 --> 07:07.094
All right, I'm gonna head off,

07:07.094 --> 07:09.555
but the second it shoots back up,
you call your midwife. Okay?

07:09.555 --> 07:11.390
Next time, we're taking you in.

07:11.390 --> 07:14.268
Keeping her nice and calm is your one job.
Okay, Daddy?

07:14.268 --> 07:17.062
Having a little stress bunny
hopping about doesn't help.

07:17.062 --> 07:18.730
I'll see you.
-Thank you.

07:21.024 --> 07:22.860
I wanted to check in before
I'm heading off.

07:22.860 --> 07:23.986
No. Hang on, Matt.

07:25.153 --> 07:28.574
You know what would keep me
nice and calm? A kebab and chips.

07:28.574 --> 07:31.368
Of course. Hey, Matt. Would you go
to the chipper and go get some--

07:31.368 --> 07:32.911
No, no. You go.

07:32.995 --> 07:37.040
You know my order. He'll get it arseways.
Do you mind, petal?

07:37.124 --> 07:38.917
No, it's fine. I can get it.

07:39.001 --> 07:41.086
Matt will stay with me until you get back.

07:42.546 --> 07:43.714
Large or small?

07:44.965 --> 07:46.842
That's a joke. It's always large.

07:55.976 --> 07:56.977
What's going on, Matt?

07:57.978 --> 07:59.104
With what?

07:59.188 --> 08:02.065
"With what?" The weather.
The bloody Williams case.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.817
He's convinced something's off.

08:03.901 --> 08:04.985
And is it?

08:06.153 --> 08:08.363
I don't know. Maybe.

08:08.447 --> 08:12.075
Well, it has to end one way or another.
Have you seen the color of his skin?

08:12.159 --> 08:14.536
The man is gray.
That is not a good look for a ginger.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.955
Yeah, I know. He's very into it.
-Yeah.

08:18.582 --> 08:20.167
How much is the payout exactly?

08:20.167 --> 08:21.335
The payout?

08:22.753 --> 08:23.754
It's...

08:23.754 --> 08:27.090
It's 875,000 euro.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.675
Do you know how I know that?

08:28.759 --> 08:31.261
Because it was written
on the back of an envelope 22 times.

08:31.345 --> 08:32.386
I have been trying, Theresa.

08:32.471 --> 08:35.515
Yeah, but you agree.
I shouldn't know this figure, you should.

08:36.225 --> 08:37.601
He's trying to protect me, I get it.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.770
So you have to help me
get to the bottom of it.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.855
I'd say the file is in the bottom drawer
of his desk.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.316
It's the only one he bothers locking.
-You're pre-- I think you--

08:44.316 --> 08:47.236
And the key is in the football mug
on the desk.

08:47.236 --> 08:51.949
The password is "Polo1998,"
but replace the o's with zeros, right?

08:51.949 --> 08:53.033
You got it?
-Yes.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.493
Right. Say it back to me.

08:55.327 --> 08:57.788
It's Polo1998.

08:58.497 --> 09:00.582
Polo. Polo, it's Dad's dog.

09:00.666 --> 09:02.376
I know. White with...

09:02.376 --> 09:03.460
A hole.
-...a hole.

09:03.544 --> 09:04.545
Yeah.

09:06.171 --> 09:07.589
Why are you still standing here?

09:07.673 --> 09:09.675
You want me to do it now?
-Yes.

09:09.675 --> 09:10.884
Okay. Yeah.

09:12.094 --> 09:13.095
Jesus.

10:10.152 --> 10:12.529
"Tom, I'm sorry to leave like this.

10:16.408 --> 10:17.910
I've messed it all up.

10:17.910 --> 10:20.621
This is the only way I know how to fix it.
Dad."

10:54.071 --> 10:56.782
Morning, Tom.
-Hi. Morning, Liz. You fancy a chip?

10:56.782 --> 10:59.743
No, thank you.
-No, too early? Get those steps in.

11:01.036 --> 11:02.996
What are you doing out here?
Is Theresa all right?

11:03.872 --> 11:05.207
Fuck.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.501
What did you do that for?

11:08.168 --> 11:09.628
I found the letter from Dad.

11:11.797 --> 11:13.757
What are you doing
going through me stuff, Matt? Please--

11:13.841 --> 11:14.925
Please, don't. Don't.

11:20.097 --> 11:21.139
Matt.

11:27.646 --> 11:29.606
So, no accidental overdose?

11:30.941 --> 11:31.942
No.

11:33.443 --> 11:34.570
He intended to die.

11:38.740 --> 11:39.950
Fuck.

11:39.950 --> 11:41.827
And those policies in the bottom drawer?

11:41.827 --> 11:42.911
Never filed.

11:45.163 --> 11:48.458
He took his clients' money
year after year. And spent it.

11:51.837 --> 11:53.672
Liam Claffin was a crook.

11:55.465 --> 11:56.466
And a liar.

11:59.094 --> 12:00.512
We can't pay the claim.

12:02.514 --> 12:05.434
And if we don't find a way out,
it's gonna blow open for--

12:05.434 --> 12:07.603
How could you not tell me, Tom?

12:07.603 --> 12:08.896
I don't know.

12:11.732 --> 12:12.733
For Dad?

12:13.775 --> 12:15.235
For you?

12:16.528 --> 12:17.905
That's how he did it.

12:18.739 --> 12:21.783
Dad would live large, and me and Mom
would pick up the mess.

12:21.867 --> 12:23.327
And you, well-- You--

12:23.327 --> 12:26.205
What? I was just the stupid kid
who made more of a mess for you?

12:26.205 --> 12:29.791
No. No. But--
You know, you brought the sunshine.

12:29.875 --> 12:32.169
That was your job.
I was there all seasons.

12:32.878 --> 12:34.087
Anyway, it's done now.

12:34.171 --> 12:36.423
So, if it comes out, we'll go to jail
for covering up his mess--

12:36.507 --> 12:37.716
Jesus Christ.

12:38.592 --> 12:40.552
Why did you have to
go and play the martyr?

12:40.636 --> 12:42.387
You could've let him take the fall.

12:42.471 --> 12:45.098
I couldn't. I could--
-No, you could, Tom. You could.

12:45.182 --> 12:48.435
And if you had told me at the time,
instead of treating me like a child,

12:48.519 --> 12:50.020
I could've told you that.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.565
I could've hit you over your stupid head

12:53.649 --> 12:56.401
and told you that your father
had no right to ask you that.

12:56.485 --> 12:58.654
Hey, he's your dad too.
-No, he isn't.

12:59.696 --> 13:01.240
He isn't anything anymore.

13:04.993 --> 13:07.329
And now we have this shit show
to deal with.

13:10.374 --> 13:11.375
Matt.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.419
Please. I'm sorry.

13:47.202 --> 13:48.287
You gonna let me in?

14:03.302 --> 14:04.511
What are you doing here?

14:11.727 --> 14:12.728
I don't know.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.153
I can't.

14:23.822 --> 14:25.490
I thought you said you wanted this.

14:26.241 --> 14:27.910
It's complicated.

14:30.829 --> 14:32.039
It's my sisters.

14:37.586 --> 14:38.587
Doesn't matter.

15:27.177 --> 15:28.262
Thank you.

15:28.262 --> 15:29.346
There you go.

15:31.682 --> 15:34.142
Will the Hardy Boys be back?

15:34.226 --> 15:38.480
No, they just wanted
to talk about the crash with JP.

15:40.482 --> 15:41.817
Was it hard talking about it?

15:41.817 --> 15:43.026
I don't know.

15:43.694 --> 15:45.404
You did all the talking, Nora.

15:46.154 --> 15:48.282
You may as well
have put a target on my back.

15:48.282 --> 15:49.658
What target?

15:49.658 --> 15:50.742
Doesn't matter.

15:51.535 --> 15:55.122
Sorry, Bi.
I just got, like, a dose of the rants.

15:57.165 --> 15:58.166
Forget it.

15:59.042 --> 16:01.378
I just hate giving the prick more airtime.

16:02.671 --> 16:04.506
I really wish he never existed.

16:06.300 --> 16:07.634
Do I sound toxic?

16:09.052 --> 16:10.179
You're allowed to hate him.

16:11.054 --> 16:12.139
I do.

16:14.766 --> 16:18.395
I'm glad he's dead. I really am.

16:22.024 --> 16:23.025
Yeah, me too.

16:33.744 --> 16:35.579
I deleted the photo.

16:35.579 --> 16:39.082
I smashed his phone, Urs.
The photo's gone, you're safe.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.960
Come on, don't be naive.
He'll have copied it somewhere.

16:42.044 --> 16:45.964
But he's not gonna tell Donal.
He likes the power over you too much.

16:46.048 --> 16:47.341
Did you tell Ben?

16:47.341 --> 16:49.510
Fuck no. I can't, he's a Scorpio.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.179
I don't know what that means.

16:52.179 --> 16:56.934
It means...
God. I should end it, but I can't.

16:56.934 --> 17:00.229
I'm just-- I'm just so tired.

17:00.229 --> 17:02.064
Come here. I know.

17:03.398 --> 17:04.398
Come on.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.736
What are you hugging it out for?

17:07.736 --> 17:10.030
Just-- Oh, shit.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.623
Grace.
-Straight to Baby B.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.375
She always goes for the childless.

17:23.001 --> 17:25.963
Sorry. I just meant that she knows
there's a better chance you'll answer.

17:25.963 --> 17:29.508
Fine. I prefer "child-free," actually.

17:29.508 --> 17:31.593
Hey, Grace. You're on speakerphone.

17:31.677 --> 17:33.262
Hey, we're just going to Forty Foot.

17:33.971 --> 17:35.389
Good for ye.

17:35.389 --> 17:39.768
Look, I'm calling because you didn't reply
on the group about JP's birthday.

17:39.852 --> 17:41.228
Paintballing.

17:41.228 --> 17:42.855
<i>Today fortnight?</i>

17:43.772 --> 17:47.276
Donal's working, so I'm on kids.
Sorry, love.

17:49.570 --> 17:51.446
I-- Is that in a fortnight?

17:51.530 --> 17:53.949
'Cause I think I've got the--
-It's a great idea.

17:53.949 --> 17:55.200
Is that Bibi?

17:55.701 --> 17:58.370
Yeah, Nora can take all of the kids.
Free up Ursula.

17:58.370 --> 18:01.415
Well, I meant to say, Urs,
Donal did tell JP he can come.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.041
So, it's a date.

18:03.125 --> 18:06.044
Yeah, I forgot how much you like
shooting things.

18:06.628 --> 18:07.629
I do.

18:08.463 --> 18:10.632
Do you wanna come for a dip?
-Yeah, we'll wait for you.

18:10.716 --> 18:12.384
I can't.

18:13.385 --> 18:17.097
I need to get ahead on lunch.
But we'll speak soon though, yeah?

18:18.056 --> 18:19.057
Okay, bye.
-Bye.

18:19.141 --> 18:22.186
Bye-bye.
-Why, Bibi? Bibi!

18:49.171 --> 18:51.256
Hey, Blanaid. What you doing?
-Just making plans.

18:51.340 --> 18:53.175
Yeah? Anything exci...

18:56.136 --> 18:58.722
I'll meet you there,
but don't do something without me.

19:00.140 --> 19:03.060
Ask first. See what your mam says.

19:17.366 --> 19:20.661
You wanna kill him at paintball?
It's a crazy idea.

19:20.661 --> 19:22.871
Well, let's just talk about it.

19:22.955 --> 19:25.707
Those things are fecking dangerous
if you hit the right place.

19:25.791 --> 19:28.794
It's the perfect cover.
And my aim is gold.

19:29.878 --> 19:31.380
What if we shoot him
in the back of the throat?

19:31.380 --> 19:34.341
Yeah. Let's just ask him
to open his mouth and say...

19:34.341 --> 19:35.592
In the temple, then.

19:35.676 --> 19:38.303
You don't want to bruise the man.
I can do that with my fist.

19:38.387 --> 19:40.097
In his creepy little head hole.

19:40.097 --> 19:42.933
Yeah! The one from the car crash.

19:42.933 --> 19:45.727
His fontanel.
-Oh, please don't call it his fontanel.

19:45.811 --> 19:47.646
It makes me picture him as a baby.

19:47.646 --> 19:51.316
I've actually seen pictures of him
as a baby, and he was a prick even then.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.610
He liked drowning frogs.
-What?

19:53.694 --> 19:56.822
Yeah. Minna used to dress him up
in girls' clothes.

19:56.822 --> 19:59.199
In his dead sister's clothes.

19:59.283 --> 20:00.284
Jesus God.

20:01.535 --> 20:04.037
Do you think you could get X-rays
from work?

20:04.121 --> 20:05.122
It won't be easy.

20:05.122 --> 20:07.165
Nothing worthwhile comes easy, girleen.

20:07.249 --> 20:09.209
Excuse me, Dad.

20:09.293 --> 20:11.336
We've got two weeks. Can you get them?

20:12.379 --> 20:13.714
Yeah.

20:13.714 --> 20:16.300
I think his head hole
is somewhere here, at the back.

20:16.300 --> 20:18.719
So if the fates are with us,
it won't be covered by his mask.

20:18.719 --> 20:21.096
If it is, we could use itching powder.
So he has to take it off.

20:21.180 --> 20:25.058
Jesus. The minute you bring itching powder
into the conversation, it's game over.

20:25.142 --> 20:28.353
I don't know. It could be our plan B.
"B" for Baby Becka.

20:28.437 --> 20:31.732
"B" for Bitch-face Bibi.
-Oh, my God.

20:32.983 --> 20:34.902
Becka! I'm stronger than you.
-Bibi! Bibi!

20:34.902 --> 20:37.237
I'm older. I'm stronger.
-How do you drown a frog?

20:37.321 --> 20:38.447
In milk.

20:38.447 --> 20:40.574
No, Bibi. No.

21:16.360 --> 21:18.737
Sweet mother of-- That--

21:50.811 --> 21:52.062
What?

21:56.692 --> 21:57.693
Fuck.

22:01.154 --> 22:04.783
Mammy, I need you
to make my office birthday cake.

22:04.867 --> 22:08.704
Gerald loves chocolate,
and you do the best chocolate cakes.

22:08.704 --> 22:11.540
You should take Friday off
for your birthday.

22:11.540 --> 22:12.749
Mammy, I'm not ten.

22:13.458 --> 22:15.377
I thought we could do something.

22:15.377 --> 22:19.089
A financial director does not
take time off for his birthday.

22:21.425 --> 22:23.343
You will have to make it today though,

22:23.427 --> 22:26.555
'cause tomorrow's the only day
that Gerald's gonna be in this week.

22:26.555 --> 22:29.433
Where's the-- Thank you.

22:29.433 --> 22:31.351
Okay. I'll do it after.

22:32.644 --> 22:33.645
After my class.

22:36.982 --> 22:38.609
What kind of chocolate cake
would you like?

22:38.609 --> 22:39.693
The rich one.

22:39.693 --> 22:42.571
The one you did last year with the--
with the raspberries,

22:42.571 --> 22:45.115
and that-- French word?

22:46.533 --> 22:52.164
Ganache. Gerald loves the ganache.

22:52.164 --> 22:56.668
I'll make it after lunch and let it cool
while I'm at my class.

22:58.003 --> 22:59.087
What class?

23:01.757 --> 23:03.383
I'm taking dancing classes.

23:04.259 --> 23:06.637
You know, just to do something.

23:07.763 --> 23:08.805
Good for you, Mum.

23:10.599 --> 23:12.267
Well, it's just a small thing.

23:12.351 --> 23:14.311
Well, that's all you have time for.

23:15.562 --> 23:16.897
You can go full Lizzo on it.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.317
Might get myself a leotard.

23:20.317 --> 23:21.693
Slut drops.

23:24.655 --> 23:25.656
No.

23:35.249 --> 23:37.042
You little flea sack.

23:43.507 --> 23:44.716
You like that?

24:17.249 --> 24:21.753
Hello, everybody. Welcome back
to the second week of Afro-Ceilidh chaos.

24:21.837 --> 24:23.755
We have some gorgeous new faces this week.

24:23.839 --> 24:27.968
So just to explain the warm-up,
we're gonna form a lovely loose circle.

24:29.803 --> 24:30.804
Brilliant.

24:31.680 --> 24:34.725
Great. And we're each gonna
take a turn in the middle

24:34.725 --> 24:36.810
to introduce ourselves through dance,

24:36.894 --> 24:39.605
and the outgoing dancer
selects the incoming.

24:39.605 --> 24:40.689
Okay.

24:43.483 --> 24:46.904
Okay. Come on, guys.
Let's move however feels good.

24:50.324 --> 24:54.578
Come on. Who's up next? Go, Toby.

24:57.998 --> 24:58.957
Yay.

25:02.961 --> 25:05.506
That's it. Go with the music.

25:07.549 --> 25:09.343
Good luck. Yay.

25:23.649 --> 25:24.650
Come on.

25:50.759 --> 25:52.177
I'm sorry. I can't.

26:23.584 --> 26:24.585
No.

26:26.670 --> 26:28.964
You don't do anything,
and when you do, you do this.

26:28.964 --> 26:31.091
Bla. I'm so sorry.
-No!

26:31.175 --> 26:32.759
Honey, I'm so--

26:32.843 --> 26:35.345
Go gentle, go gentle. Accidents happen.

26:35.429 --> 26:37.598
Oh, God. Oh, my goodness.

26:37.598 --> 26:39.391
Especially when you have
a Garvey girl in the car.

26:39.391 --> 26:40.893
I hate you, Mum.
-Sweetheart.

26:44.313 --> 26:46.982
You shovel him up while I park the car.

26:46.982 --> 26:48.817
We'll bury him next to Oscar. Okay?

26:53.113 --> 26:55.199
Can a skull look smug?

26:56.909 --> 26:58.827
That's his head hole right there.

26:59.369 --> 27:00.370
Okay.

27:10.047 --> 27:11.048
Okay.

27:12.257 --> 27:13.258
Hang on.

27:24.811 --> 27:27.523
Well, I haven't been able to practice,
because I can't take this out at home.

27:36.240 --> 27:39.910
Stop doing that.
Looking at each other with those faces.

27:43.038 --> 27:46.083
And it's not my eye.
You don't need two eyes to aim.

27:46.083 --> 27:50.838
It's all about the stance.
The grip. Breath.

27:50.838 --> 27:54.132
Will you have time to do all that? 'Cause
it's gonna be very frantic on the day.

27:54.883 --> 27:57.219
Can I just hit it first
before you start dismantling the plan?

27:57.219 --> 28:01.473
No one's dismantling the plan. Okay?
Just take your time.

28:01.557 --> 28:03.100
It will come back.
-Yeah.

28:08.605 --> 28:09.940
I'm just gonna move a bit.

28:22.411 --> 28:23.704
Bull's-eye!

28:29.960 --> 28:32.504
No, Father. There was no penetration.

28:34.423 --> 28:36.049
Yeah. I--

28:36.133 --> 28:38.760
I think we're gonna have to
give it another thinkety-think.

28:38.844 --> 28:41.013
You know, because,
I mean, hitting the target is one thing.

28:41.013 --> 28:42.681
But if it's not even leaving a dent...

28:42.681 --> 28:44.683
What a surprise.
We're not gonna paintball him to death.

28:48.604 --> 28:49.855
I have to go to work.

28:51.440 --> 28:52.983
And I have to go to my studio.

28:52.983 --> 28:55.402
Oh, no, wait. I don't have a studio.

28:56.570 --> 28:57.571
Bibi.

29:02.117 --> 29:03.535
Do you want some watermelon?

29:03.619 --> 29:05.913
Yeah.
-Got some feta.

29:10.083 --> 29:13.045
So, when do I get to meet
the rest of the Spice Girls then?

29:13.045 --> 29:15.547
There is a scary one actually.
And a baby one.

29:16.089 --> 29:18.217
And a ginger one, but sometimes.

29:18.217 --> 29:19.885
So you're either Posh or Sporty.

29:19.885 --> 29:22.596
I'm Posh with a capital "P."

29:22.596 --> 29:24.139
There's no sporty ones.

29:24.223 --> 29:27.226
And we're all good at downing wine
if that's a sport? Is that a sport?

29:27.226 --> 29:28.769
If so, I'm an athlete.

29:31.104 --> 29:32.147
Oh, my God.

29:33.190 --> 29:35.025
It's not even his birthday until Friday.

29:35.025 --> 29:37.110
Don't deny the big boy his birth week.

29:41.907 --> 29:45.077
Old family recipe.

29:45.077 --> 29:47.371
Well, such heirlooms are priceless.

29:48.747 --> 29:51.834
I was thinking about
taking the boat out for my birthday.

29:54.336 --> 29:57.631
Bayliner 2566 model, 27 feet.

29:57.631 --> 29:59.758
I thought, perhaps,
you might like to join me?

29:59.842 --> 30:01.718
I'm surrounded by women at home.

30:01.802 --> 30:04.471
So,
I could really use some proper man time.

30:04.555 --> 30:05.973
Uh-huh.

30:07.182 --> 30:08.767
We've had some good times on there.

30:11.979 --> 30:13.647
Suits you.

30:14.398 --> 30:15.566
Yeah.

30:18.527 --> 30:21.655
Well, what goes on tour stays on tour.

30:21.655 --> 30:23.282
Sailor's honor.

30:23.282 --> 30:26.243
Needless to say,
you'll be afforded the same honor.

30:26.243 --> 30:29.538
Not that you or I
would drink to that excess.

30:30.914 --> 30:32.583
Didn't think she would either.
-What?

30:33.500 --> 30:37.796
Well, as Grace says about her sponge cake,
"perfect until it collapses."

30:38.839 --> 30:41.300
Anyway, we're all human, right?

30:41.300 --> 30:45.137
So, enjoy, and I'll let you know
when she's ready for high seas...

30:45.137 --> 30:46.221
The same size?
-...okay?

30:46.305 --> 30:48.307
Well, yeah.
-I'm sorry.

30:50.559 --> 30:52.227
So, we should get sporty.

30:52.311 --> 30:53.437
Yeah?

30:53.437 --> 30:55.105
Like hand-to-mouth drills?

30:55.189 --> 30:57.816
Yeah, exactly. Like, build those arms up.
-Okay.

30:59.109 --> 31:01.987
Or maybe squeeze in some culture first.
-Really? Do we have to?

31:01.987 --> 31:05.449
Okay, we'll do a quick lap
around the National Gallery.

31:05.449 --> 31:07.117
Yeah.
-We'll just get the bloods flowing.

31:07.201 --> 31:09.578
Yeah. Shall I wear a sweatband?

31:09.578 --> 31:11.914
Well, do you have matching wristbands?

31:11.914 --> 31:15.000
Naturally.
-Well, then, of course.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.460
Okay.
-Okay.

31:17.002 --> 31:19.129
And your little shorts. Not really.

31:19.713 --> 31:20.714
Shit.

31:20.714 --> 31:23.425
You can't go around hitting people
in your class, Ruben.

31:24.176 --> 31:25.427
You broke his glasses.

31:25.511 --> 31:27.513
Okay. Well, let's just leave it for now.

31:27.513 --> 31:29.473
You could have done permanent damage.

31:29.473 --> 31:30.557
Jesus, Ruben!

31:32.809 --> 31:35.521
Tell me why you hit him.
Or I'll burn your comics.

31:36.104 --> 31:38.482
And your trading cards.
-No, she's not gonna burn your comics.

31:38.482 --> 31:40.943
What about my trading cards?
-Or your trading cards.

31:41.693 --> 31:43.862
You better not.
-Ruben!

31:43.946 --> 31:45.531
I didn't do anything wrong!

31:46.240 --> 31:47.699
What are we meant to do so?

31:47.783 --> 31:50.452
You're supposed to wait until you're calm,
till you decide on the consequences.

31:51.620 --> 31:53.038
We'll be waiting a while then.

31:56.166 --> 31:58.669
We're doing
this positive parenting course.

31:58.669 --> 32:01.004
We had to do a personality assessment.

32:01.088 --> 32:03.048
My profile was...

32:03.048 --> 32:05.592
superior and controlling.

32:05.676 --> 32:06.718
Nailed it!

32:07.344 --> 32:08.470
What about Nora?

32:09.137 --> 32:10.430
Pleasing and comforting.

32:11.723 --> 32:12.850
She really is though.

32:14.059 --> 32:17.729
You know what I thought? I thought,
"She's Grace, and I'm the prick."

32:17.813 --> 32:20.732
You're not the prick, Bibi.

32:21.900 --> 32:23.443
You'll never be the prick.

32:23.527 --> 32:26.572
Do you think for a second
he's assessing his parenting skills?

32:26.572 --> 32:28.115
Wondering how he can do better?

32:28.115 --> 32:29.199
Not a chance.

32:29.283 --> 32:31.577
Blanaid's not being raised
by a one-eyed lesbian though.

32:32.578 --> 32:34.162
I'm on the back foot, Eva.

32:34.788 --> 32:35.873
Have to get this right.

32:35.873 --> 32:36.999
Listen to me.

32:39.001 --> 32:42.004
You can't handle your drink, okay?
You're a terrible cinema date,

32:42.004 --> 32:45.757
and you're one of the worst poker partners
I've ever had. Ever.

32:46.675 --> 32:48.468
You're one of the best parents I know.

32:49.303 --> 32:52.097
Probably-- You know, probably the best.

32:53.056 --> 32:54.808
Just don't tell Ursula that.

32:57.561 --> 33:01.690
And, you know, when you think about
what poor Blanaid's been damned with.

33:02.316 --> 33:04.234
Not Grace obviously, although--

33:05.986 --> 33:08.822
You are the opposite of that.
You are a light for Ruben.

33:12.367 --> 33:15.787
Ursula says she wishes
Ben had seen her in all her glory.

33:15.871 --> 33:19.124
Body-wise, you know.
Before kids and gravity.

33:21.793 --> 33:26.089
Ruben won't remember me. Before...

33:28.300 --> 33:30.761
That doesn't make you
any less of a parent.

33:32.888 --> 33:33.889
Okay?

33:35.933 --> 33:38.018
Maybe one eye less of a parent.

33:47.653 --> 33:48.946
I'm not gonna give up, Eva.

33:51.406 --> 33:52.783
I will kill him.

33:55.452 --> 33:57.829
But this is for Grace, remember?

33:57.913 --> 33:59.373
And Blanaid.

33:59.957 --> 34:01.500
That's why we're doing this, right?

34:03.794 --> 34:05.254
Yeah, but we'll all be better off.

34:05.254 --> 34:07.506
Revenge is toxic.

34:09.925 --> 34:13.094
It's all right for you.
He didn't ruin your life.

34:28.277 --> 34:29.277
I love this one.

34:30.027 --> 34:31.029
Me too.

34:31.989 --> 34:33.739
The heartbreak of forbidden love.

34:37.244 --> 34:40.831
She can't bear to look at him.
And then he'll take any part of her.

34:44.835 --> 34:46.210
You ever had a forbidden love?

34:48.338 --> 34:51.884
A courtier never tells.
-You have.

34:54.887 --> 34:56.722
So, were you a culture-vulture in Paris?

34:57.222 --> 34:58.765
I was more into antique fairs.

34:59.558 --> 35:01.476
God, you should come to my house.

35:01.560 --> 35:04.396
I've got the old family home
full of antiques.

35:04.396 --> 35:05.647
So you've never left?

35:05.731 --> 35:07.566
No. I grew old in that house.

35:08.942 --> 35:10.777
You must have a painting in your attic.

35:12.321 --> 35:13.363
Fuck off.

35:14.364 --> 35:17.659
Compliment accepted
like a true Irish woman. Yeah.

35:18.243 --> 35:19.411
My mother used to...

35:20.329 --> 35:21.705
To?
-It's Ciaran.

35:22.873 --> 35:23.874
Eva.

35:24.791 --> 35:26.043
Hey.
-Wow.

35:27.836 --> 35:30.172
How are you?
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

35:30.881 --> 35:32.466
Yeah, very good.
-Right.

35:33.050 --> 35:35.010
Sorry. This is my--

35:35.886 --> 35:36.887
This is Nadia.

35:36.887 --> 35:37.846
Hi.
-Hi.

35:37.930 --> 35:39.348
Boys, come on over.

35:41.016 --> 35:43.644
This is Conor, and this is Tom.

35:44.520 --> 35:46.980
Hi. Hi, I'm Gabriel.

35:47.064 --> 35:48.732
Hi, Gabriel.
-Hey.

35:48.732 --> 35:49.650
Hi.

35:49.650 --> 35:50.817
Hello.
-Hi.

35:50.901 --> 35:52.569
We've just come from a workshop.

35:52.653 --> 35:54.738
We had to choose our favorite paintings
and paint them.

35:54.738 --> 35:56.031
And yours?

35:56.782 --> 35:59.076
That is William Mackinnon's <i>Hope</i>.

35:59.701 --> 36:01.119
That's my favorite.

36:01.203 --> 36:03.038
It's my daddy's too.

36:04.665 --> 36:05.707
Yeah.

36:07.709 --> 36:11.088
Well, we should be leaving, shouldn't we?
-Yeah, I was gonna-- Because we have--

36:12.256 --> 36:13.799
Bye.
-Bye.

36:14.341 --> 36:15.384
Bye.
-Bye, Eva.

36:18.470 --> 36:19.888
An old boyfriend?

36:19.972 --> 36:21.849
Yeah. Old.

36:22.766 --> 36:24.268
Ten-years-ago old.

36:25.102 --> 36:26.520
Hard one to recover from?

36:28.105 --> 36:29.273
Yeah. I mean...

36:29.273 --> 36:31.024
It was proper, you know?

36:31.108 --> 36:33.110
We were going to have a family together
and...

36:34.152 --> 36:35.195
What happened?

36:37.364 --> 36:40.284
Sad story. I'm not super fertile.

36:42.077 --> 36:45.414
Didn't-- Didn't deal with it very well.

36:53.463 --> 36:56.258
Come on. Let's go drink
criminal amounts of brandy.

36:56.258 --> 36:57.551
Yeah.
-Yeah.

36:57.551 --> 37:00.012
Fuck culture.
-Yeah. Who needs it anyway?

37:00.012 --> 37:01.763
Not us sporty types.

37:06.059 --> 37:08.103
<i>Show me them one more time.</i>

37:11.148 --> 37:12.399
Consent to kiss the guns?

37:22.367 --> 37:24.077
The boy I hit is stupid.

37:25.913 --> 37:27.122
Why is he stupid?

37:29.082 --> 37:30.584
Tell me.

37:31.168 --> 37:32.794
He was calling you Cyclops.

37:34.671 --> 37:36.215
So you were defending my honor?

37:37.716 --> 37:38.717
No?

37:39.885 --> 37:40.886
Cyclops is a man.

37:41.470 --> 37:43.680
He has an optical blast
that can burn through anything.

37:45.140 --> 37:46.517
You're just a mum.

37:47.392 --> 37:48.393
With one eye.

37:50.187 --> 37:52.564
No, I have an optical blast.

37:53.649 --> 37:55.692
I use it on Principal Ní Mheara.

37:56.360 --> 37:57.653
Does it work?

37:58.612 --> 38:01.365
Blast through her nonsense all the time.

38:01.365 --> 38:02.866
So you are a super mum?

38:04.034 --> 38:07.037
Yeah. Yes, I am.

38:45.158 --> 38:46.451
Thanks for this.

38:47.202 --> 38:49.705
When the third taxi cancels,
you start to take it personally.

38:50.998 --> 38:52.207
No problem.

38:54.042 --> 38:55.377
I don't want you to be late.

38:55.377 --> 38:56.420
I'm not in a hurry.

39:00.507 --> 39:02.926
What's with the nerves?
Because of your parents, is it?

39:03.010 --> 39:05.679
Listen, cars are a lot safer these days.

39:05.679 --> 39:09.266
And there was absolutely no need
for that accident to be fatal.

39:09.266 --> 39:11.935
And your dad was a reckless driver.

39:12.019 --> 39:14.271
I mean, I'm all about safety, you know?

39:14.271 --> 39:16.440
Can you stop the car? I wanna get out.

39:16.440 --> 39:18.192
I don't think I can.

39:24.114 --> 39:25.616
Stop the car!
-No, stop it! Wait!

39:25.616 --> 39:27.993
Stop the car! Stop the car!
-No. Let go.

39:49.723 --> 39:50.807
Bull's-eye.

40:00.400 --> 40:02.569
I think you might have been right
about the dance classes.

40:04.154 --> 40:05.572
Was it awful, Mammy?

40:07.533 --> 40:08.867
I thought I could dance.

40:10.118 --> 40:11.703
I thought it would make me feel...

40:13.455 --> 40:14.581
It was...

40:17.835 --> 40:19.628
But you are not a showgirl.

40:22.172 --> 40:23.507
You're a queen.

40:27.761 --> 40:28.929
This is your kingdom.

40:29.805 --> 40:33.100
And when you leave bad things happen.

40:34.977 --> 40:36.186
We need you here.

40:43.402 --> 40:45.863
I need to get up to speed
on these accounts.

40:50.868 --> 40:54.872
It's been so long, JP. We should.

41:00.669 --> 41:02.254
Try tomorrow, Mammy.

41:04.798 --> 41:06.466
Try tomorrow.
-Yeah.

41:36.163 --> 41:38.540
Why do you live on a boat?

41:42.836 --> 41:45.506
Your boat is rocking me.

41:45.506 --> 41:47.549
I'm gonna use your pole.

41:47.633 --> 41:49.927
This is a bit fatter than my normal pole--

41:54.640 --> 41:55.682
Are you okay?

42:18.789 --> 42:19.790
Wait.

42:20.457 --> 42:21.917
Maybe-- Maybe we shouldn't.

42:21.917 --> 42:23.001
It's okay.

42:29.383 --> 42:30.717
Hey.

42:35.681 --> 42:36.849
Oh, God.

42:37.558 --> 42:38.559
Wait, stop.

42:45.274 --> 42:46.483
Is it me?

42:46.567 --> 42:48.735
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Jesus. No. It's me.

42:52.155 --> 42:54.408
I'm not into women, Eva.

42:57.160 --> 43:01.248
And if I was,
I'd be into you literally right now.

43:07.963 --> 43:08.964
Right.

43:12.176 --> 43:14.595
Why did you string me along then?

43:14.595 --> 43:16.555
Well, I didn't mean to.

43:16.555 --> 43:17.890
I mean, not like that.

43:18.724 --> 43:20.517
I just really enjoy hanging out.

43:20.601 --> 43:22.477
You're very beautiful.
You're funny. You're smart.

43:22.561 --> 43:26.190
Yeah, but if I'd have--
If I'd have known, you know?

43:26.190 --> 43:28.400
If I'd have jus--
-Oh, no.

43:29.276 --> 43:30.694
This is awful!

43:30.694 --> 43:32.738
What do you mean?
No, it's not. It's great.

43:32.738 --> 43:35.574
It means we can be proper friends.
-Shut up.

43:35.574 --> 43:36.742
Okay.

43:36.742 --> 43:39.369
I mean, why aren't you out?

43:41.580 --> 43:43.749
I mean, this is Ireland 2022.

43:43.749 --> 43:47.294
We're a bit
fucking progressive these days.

43:47.294 --> 43:48.378
I know.

43:48.462 --> 43:51.798
I just like to keep
my private and work life separate.

43:51.882 --> 43:52.966
Fucking shoe.

43:53.842 --> 43:56.178
Well, I wish I had done the same.
I don't know what I was thinking.

43:56.178 --> 43:57.638
Don't go. Stay over, please.

43:58.222 --> 43:59.890
I feel so stupid.

44:33.090 --> 44:34.091
You could have--

44:36.385 --> 44:38.720
You could have given me
a sign or something.

44:38.804 --> 44:40.722
Like, hold up a sign, "I'm gay"?

44:40.806 --> 44:46.061
No. But a bloody...
bloody rainbow. You know?

44:46.061 --> 44:49.356
A bloody little rainbow ribbon thing.

44:50.440 --> 44:51.608
Medal.

44:55.612 --> 44:56.613
Come here.

45:08.125 --> 45:11.670
You know when you asked me earlier
if I've ever had a forbidden love?

45:14.423 --> 45:15.424
I did.

45:16.300 --> 45:17.301
More than one.

45:20.971 --> 45:22.681
'Cause it was all forbidden.

45:23.891 --> 45:27.269
And for my family, nothing was--

45:29.897 --> 45:31.356
What's the word?

45:33.859 --> 45:35.110
Permissible?

45:35.694 --> 45:36.695
Yeah, that's the word.

45:38.530 --> 45:40.490
I mean, you could have
gone for a simpler word.

45:40.574 --> 45:44.661
Like, "allowed" or "okay."

45:47.956 --> 45:50.501
I'm sorry you had a tough time
with your family.

46:15.275 --> 46:17.611
Oh, no!

46:34.002 --> 46:35.712
I'm gonna freeze the little fuckers.

46:44.680 --> 46:45.681
Okay.

46:53.814 --> 46:55.232
There she is!

46:56.275 --> 46:59.444
What's all the panic about?
-No panic. We're on.

47:00.112 --> 47:02.114
Look what she did. Look at that!

47:02.114 --> 47:04.116
I nailed my aim and froze the pellets.

47:05.075 --> 47:07.035
I can now get it through his thick skull.

47:07.870 --> 47:09.454
We just need to work out
how to swap them out.

47:09.538 --> 47:11.373
But how do you know
what kind of pellets they use?

47:11.373 --> 47:13.917
I rang them.
Played the obsessive enthusiast.

47:14.001 --> 47:17.045
They use .68s and masks, not helmets.

47:17.129 --> 47:19.423
So, his head hole will be exposed.

47:19.423 --> 47:22.050
Yeah. I mean, there's still some things
to figure out, but--

47:22.134 --> 47:25.137
Yeah, but it-- The pellet's going through.
That's a start.

47:25.137 --> 47:27.306
There was penetration, Father.

47:27.306 --> 47:31.018
You need to hit the exact spot--
-Oh, my God. I can do this!

47:31.018 --> 47:34.563
I know I do because I don't ever fail
when I want something this much.

47:34.563 --> 47:36.356
Ask Nora.
-You told Nora?

47:36.440 --> 47:37.774
Of course not.

47:39.651 --> 47:43.113
Once we're up and running,
I will find a quiet spot,

47:43.197 --> 47:44.823
swap in the frozen pellets...

47:46.992 --> 47:48.410
and shoot the prick dead.

47:50.579 --> 47:51.413
Now, listen.

47:52.206 --> 47:53.457
This is how it's gonna go.

47:53.999 --> 47:56.710
<i>Their regular session is two teams
against each other.</i>

47:57.336 --> 48:01.089
<i>Let's put Donal with JP.
JP will love that. Boys against girls.</i>

48:02.090 --> 48:07.095
<i>So, team A will be
JP, Donal, Ursula and Grace.</i>

48:07.596 --> 48:10.224
<i>Team B: me, Eva and Becka.</i>

48:11.391 --> 48:14.520
<i>Urs, you'll keep Donal and Grace
away from me and Eva.</i>

48:14.520 --> 48:16.522
<i>Eva, you and I will target JP.</i>

48:16.522 --> 48:19.274
<i>Make him feel like
we're his real opposition out there.</i>

48:19.358 --> 48:22.611
<i>Well, what do I do then?</i>
-<i>Just don't get in the way.</i>

48:22.611 --> 48:25.113
Over there.
-Come on.

48:25.656 --> 48:28.158
What are we waiting for? Let's go!

48:29.993 --> 48:35.624
Good morning, everyone.
My name is Cyril, aka, Cyril the squirrel.

48:35.624 --> 48:38.335
Because I know and love every cubic inch
of these woods

48:38.335 --> 48:40.671
so please, respect them.

48:41.922 --> 48:43.257
Also, I like nuts.

48:43.257 --> 48:46.718
Rule number one, never take off your mask.

48:46.802 --> 48:48.887
If you do,
you'll go straight to the sin bin.

48:50.013 --> 48:51.181
Everyone understand?

48:51.723 --> 48:53.350
Yes.
-Good.

48:53.350 --> 48:54.726
Okay.

48:55.561 --> 48:59.481
Special request from the birthday boy
who's organized his own surprise.

49:00.148 --> 49:03.193
So, today, instead of playing
our normal two-player teams,

49:03.861 --> 49:06.530
we'll be playing a game
called "Shoot the Bunny."

49:07.239 --> 49:08.240
Shoot the what?

49:10.242 --> 49:13.120
One of you will have
a rabbit's foot in your breast pocket.

49:23.964 --> 49:25.007
It's you, Mammy.

49:25.007 --> 49:27.676
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fun.
Just run, run, run.

49:27.676 --> 49:30.095
You're good, and you're fast.
You can do it.

49:30.179 --> 49:31.013
Bunny!

49:31.013 --> 49:33.348
It's your job to try and get
from one side of the obstacle course

49:33.432 --> 49:34.933
to the other without getting hit.

49:35.767 --> 49:38.478
Okay? All understand?
-Okay.

49:38.979 --> 49:40.189
Are we all ready?

49:41.815 --> 49:42.816
Yes.

49:42.900 --> 49:44.276
Then please follow me.

49:51.950 --> 49:53.118
What now?

49:56.830 --> 49:57.831
Improvise.

49:59.625 --> 50:01.835
Come on, Ursula! Over here.
-Becka, come on.

50:25.859 --> 50:27.361
You and I follow JP.

50:55.722 --> 50:58.475
Now, Bibi. While he has his back to us.

51:01.687 --> 51:02.729
Come on!

51:08.694 --> 51:10.279
Oh, shit.

51:10.904 --> 51:12.072
Fuck.

51:12.072 --> 51:14.408
What now? Bibi.

51:14.408 --> 51:15.492
Follow me.

51:16.660 --> 51:17.703
Okay.

51:22.791 --> 51:25.377
I found you, Mammy.

51:27.045 --> 51:28.630
Look at him. Bastard.

51:29.214 --> 51:32.885
Run. Can't hide.

51:32.885 --> 51:33.969
Prick.

51:38.599 --> 51:40.517
Stop. Go back! Go!

51:42.144 --> 51:43.270
Stay out of the way, Becka.

51:44.479 --> 51:45.397
Oh, shit.

51:54.072 --> 51:55.699
Lead him over there. That way, that way.

51:55.699 --> 51:56.950
Okay.

52:10.714 --> 52:12.758
Hi there!
-All right, lads.

52:13.926 --> 52:17.012
Give me five minutes there,
and we'll get you on no bother.

52:18.138 --> 52:19.723
You've got a clear shot!

52:19.723 --> 52:21.350
Bibi, do it.

52:30.692 --> 52:31.777
Do it, Bibi.

52:32.945 --> 52:34.238
Five minutes.

52:38.992 --> 52:40.327
Go on!

52:45.457 --> 52:46.792
Somebody call an ambulance!

52:49.419 --> 52:53.507
Don't move. Try to stay still for me,
mate. That's it. Just stay on your back.

52:55.425 --> 52:58.303
Stay calm. Calm down.
-Just try to keep your hand by your side.

52:58.387 --> 53:01.265
I'm Donal, I'm a paramedic.
This is Ursula, she's a nurse.

53:01.265 --> 53:04.601
We're gonna look after you. Okay?
Try not to touch your eye. That's it.

53:05.143 --> 53:08.522
That's it. Just breathe.
-Take deep breaths, Cyril. In.

53:09.565 --> 53:11.275
We promise you it'll be okay.
-Bibi.

53:11.275 --> 53:12.359
Bibi.

53:13.527 --> 53:15.195
Did somebody call an ambulance?

53:17.114 --> 53:18.574
What's going on?

53:20.784 --> 53:24.204
What happened?
-Don't scream, Mammy.

53:29.626 --> 53:30.752
Keep breathing.

53:30.836 --> 53:31.837
What the fuck?

53:31.837 --> 53:34.339
That's it. In. Doing good.

53:34.423 --> 53:36.425
You're doing great.
You're doing great, Cyril.

53:36.425 --> 53:39.261
I'd like you to stay with me.
You can hear me, can't you?

53:44.474 --> 53:46.059
No, no, no.

53:49.771 --> 53:52.524
No, no, no, no, no, no.
