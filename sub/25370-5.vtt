00:02.687 --> 00:04.771
- Morning, Vera.
- Fuck you.

00:05.039 --> 00:08.526
- I'm pregnant.
- To Jake.

00:08.576 --> 00:11.010
You need to get your shit
together, or you're gonna blow it.

00:11.033 --> 00:14.278
You didn't have to bury
someone fucking alive, OK?

00:14.455 --> 00:15.919
You buried her alive?

00:15.951 --> 00:17.174
OK, full name, please?

00:17.180 --> 00:19.578
- Marie Louise Winter.
- Next of kin?

00:19.846 --> 00:21.566
There's no-one, it's just me.

00:22.451 --> 00:24.401
You're never gonna to
fucking believe who's here.

00:24.406 --> 00:25.478
Allie!

00:25.501 --> 00:28.177
- God, you look so grown-up!
- Well, it's been a long time.

00:28.183 --> 00:32.069
- Everything OK?
- Hello, Karen. God, long time.

00:32.073 --> 00:35.008
I find you recruiting girls in
here and I will come down on you.

00:35.036 --> 00:36.293
I'm sure that's true.

00:36.299 --> 00:38.282
You can handle yourself,
you got a cool head.

00:38.296 --> 00:39.845
You wanna be my guardian angel?

00:39.863 --> 00:41.667
Well, so, where are the
police on the Gilmour murder?

00:41.673 --> 00:45.157
No weapon, no motive, no
suspect. Basically no idea.

00:45.734 --> 00:47.180
Just imagine I were to discover

00:47.199 --> 00:50.092
who killed Gilmour, that would...
that would be useful, wouldn't it?

00:50.098 --> 00:52.767
I'll make you a deal, the
killer for the workshop.

00:52.774 --> 00:55.178
- What's this?
- I don't fucking know, it's not mine!

00:55.201 --> 00:57.497
- Slot her.
- I've been fucking set up!

00:57.503 --> 00:59.489
You will reopen my workshop...

00:59.495 --> 01:01.380
And every woman in that workshop

01:01.386 --> 01:03.264
- has to have a TAFE certificate.
- Done.

01:03.270 --> 01:06.587
Everything will be fine. Just
as soon as you pass the test.

01:58.167 --> 01:59.751
When was your last period?

02:02.371 --> 02:04.354
I think it was eight weeks ago.

02:06.008 --> 02:07.617
Are your cycles regular?

02:08.491 --> 02:10.126
Usually, um...

02:10.558 --> 02:12.609
I've just been under
a bit of stress lately.

02:12.938 --> 02:15.226
And your last Pap smear?

02:16.134 --> 02:17.802
Six, seven months ago.

02:20.095 --> 02:22.440
Yes. You're eight weeks along.

02:28.370 --> 02:29.854
So um...

02:30.473 --> 02:33.979
- the mif... m-mif...
- Mifepristone?

02:34.762 --> 02:36.769
I can take that to terminate.

02:36.775 --> 02:38.971
That's right, up to nine weeks.

02:39.579 --> 02:41.830
The procedure requires two tablets,

02:41.836 --> 02:45.487
the first blocks the progesterone
needed to maintain the pregnancy,

02:45.493 --> 02:48.133
- and the second pill expels it.
- _

02:49.182 --> 02:51.698
- Now, it's incumbent on me to inform you
- _

02:51.704 --> 02:53.002
- that fertility declines
- _

02:53.008 --> 02:55.128
- fairly rapidly from your mid-30s.
- _

02:55.134 --> 02:57.828
After 40, your chances really fall away.

02:59.130 --> 03:01.941
Something to bear in mind, perhaps,
when you make your decision.

03:03.296 --> 03:06.614
We also have counselling available
if you wanna talk to someone.

03:08.639 --> 03:10.844
I don't think I'd make a good mother.

03:10.904 --> 03:12.672
I'm sure that's not true.

03:13.856 --> 03:16.776
But you don't need to decide today,
you have a week to think about it.

03:18.028 --> 03:20.234
Have you discussed it
with the baby's father?

03:29.591 --> 03:31.227
- Morning.
- What is it?

03:31.250 --> 03:32.395
Have you seen this?

03:32.428 --> 03:33.994
- Didn't take them long to sink the boots in.
- _

03:34.007 --> 03:35.227
Y... you don't have to tell me.

03:35.246 --> 03:37.578
The media office have
been haranging me already.

03:37.648 --> 03:39.352
Pisses me off,
questioning your judgment.

03:39.356 --> 03:41.477
You're the most
level-headed person I know.

03:47.885 --> 03:49.751
Ah, Susan!

03:49.793 --> 03:51.595
It is good to be up and
running again, isn't it?

03:51.598 --> 03:54.096
- Yeah, good for some.
- Oh, come on!

03:54.176 --> 03:56.597
You'll have your welding ticket soon!

03:57.012 --> 03:59.225
How long, till your exam, hm?

03:59.350 --> 04:01.655
- Oh, well, actually, it's not 'til...
- Governor!

04:01.661 --> 04:04.471
Yeah, glad you're interested!
Thanks for the chat!

04:04.477 --> 04:06.142
To what do I owe the pleasure?

04:07.730 --> 04:09.842
So much for your positive PR.

04:10.096 --> 04:12.603
Yes, well that... that was, um...

04:13.015 --> 04:14.833
- unfortunate.
- Was it?

04:16.493 --> 04:18.916
How did you sell this workshop to me?

04:19.349 --> 04:23.915
As a shining beacon of prison
re-education, a good news story.

04:24.676 --> 04:26.755
What, so this is my fault?!

04:26.783 --> 04:29.088
- Are all these women certified?
- Yes!

04:29.550 --> 04:32.922
Only women with tickets are
allowed to use the machinery.

04:32.928 --> 04:35.906
- Everybody else is on the simple tasks.
- I've spent...

04:35.938 --> 04:40.072
all morning on the phone to
the Corrections Media Office...

04:40.470 --> 04:42.624
deciding how to respond.

04:43.680 --> 04:45.793
If I close the workshop down now...

04:45.799 --> 04:48.106
- You would be kowtowing to the press.
- Exactly!

04:48.143 --> 04:50.656
So I am not shutting it down.

04:50.739 --> 04:52.992
I am inviting them in.

04:52.998 --> 04:54.363
What do they say?

04:54.744 --> 04:58.484
Create the news, control the narrative.

04:58.523 --> 05:00.564
We are gonna show the press first-hand

05:00.582 --> 05:02.903
how exceptional this workshop really is.

05:02.909 --> 05:06.135
Well, I think that's
an excellent strategy.

05:10.344 --> 05:14.020
Soon as I get out of here, we're
gonna go on a trip, you and me.

05:14.145 --> 05:16.890
- Anywhere you wanna go.
- Yeah.

05:18.174 --> 05:20.409
I'm really proud of you at school.

05:20.599 --> 05:22.428
You're doing so well...

05:22.434 --> 05:25.047
So, have you found the
bastard who killed my boy?

05:25.053 --> 05:26.948
No, but we will.

05:28.435 --> 05:29.967
So why are you here?

05:31.811 --> 05:33.464
How are you getting on?

05:34.980 --> 05:37.130
Zara, what's the problem?

05:40.516 --> 05:43.596
The merchandise is arriving
at the port tomorrow,

05:43.721 --> 05:45.707
but our associate is very nervous.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.621
- Why?
- You need to reassure him.

05:47.652 --> 05:49.707
That is your side of the business, Zara.

05:49.717 --> 05:52.334
- You take care of it.
- Well, it's different now! He's scared.

05:52.549 --> 05:55.218
He needs to be convinced
that you're still in control,

05:55.224 --> 05:58.822
- or he won't go through with the deal.
- Should I just drop in on my way home?

05:58.842 --> 06:01.385
- By telephone?
- Well, he'd have to get on my call list,

06:01.399 --> 06:03.096
which obviously can't happen.

06:04.754 --> 06:09.060
- Can you get a phone in?
- Not now! Security checks.

06:09.357 --> 06:10.516
OK.

06:12.876 --> 06:14.493
OK, leave that with me.

06:14.766 --> 06:18.360
You just get me a clean SIM
card. Can you at least do that?

06:21.219 --> 06:22.633
Thanks.

06:26.236 --> 06:27.396
Spike?

06:30.255 --> 06:32.097
- Love?
- Not your love.

06:32.759 --> 06:35.537
Well, I'm here as your peer worker,
to see how you're holding up.

06:36.482 --> 06:37.837
I didn't kill her.

06:38.996 --> 06:40.591
I fuckin' loved her.

06:41.463 --> 06:43.181
- I know.
- No...

06:43.385 --> 06:45.462
no, you know jack shit, Liz.

06:45.533 --> 06:47.213
Now piss off.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.389
Piss off!

07:00.797 --> 07:02.530
I know you didn't kill her...

07:03.961 --> 07:05.515
'cause I know who did.

07:08.613 --> 07:09.951
Who?

07:10.100 --> 07:11.414
Sonia.

07:11.876 --> 07:14.374
Stevens? Yeah, right.

07:16.430 --> 07:19.897
Why would that stuck-up
bitch wanna kill my Shaz?

07:20.148 --> 07:21.895
'Cause she's fucked in the head.

07:26.516 --> 07:28.874
- Oh, shit.
- What?

07:28.999 --> 07:30.888
- I saw her.
- Saw her?

07:30.898 --> 07:32.274
Stevens.

07:33.716 --> 07:37.379
She was hanging around my
unit like a bad fuckin' smell.

07:38.479 --> 07:40.345
Just before I got tossed.

07:40.396 --> 07:42.563
That must've been when
she planted the knife.

07:42.605 --> 07:43.716
Fuck.

07:44.996 --> 07:46.559
Fuck!

07:48.773 --> 07:50.519
When I get out of this box...

07:51.276 --> 07:53.520
then I'll fuckin' kill the bitch!

08:03.593 --> 08:04.891
Yes, thank you.

08:05.956 --> 08:07.156
Liz!

08:08.346 --> 08:10.676
- Want to hear my good news?
- Yeah.

08:10.905 --> 08:14.975
The court has just allowed me
to change my plea to not guilty.

08:15.017 --> 08:16.698
Not only that,

08:16.777 --> 08:19.836
the governor is inviting
the press into the workshop.

08:19.961 --> 08:23.416
- Oh!
- Our plan is coming to fruition.

08:26.816 --> 08:29.850
Well, a little more enthusiasm
would be appreciated.

08:30.036 --> 08:33.316
- Oh.
- Remember what's at stake here, Liz.

08:33.356 --> 08:35.606
Hope you showered this morning, Ronaldo.

08:35.629 --> 08:37.505
The doctor's expecting you.

08:39.116 --> 08:42.457
Look at it all! It's just
too much to think about.

08:42.721 --> 08:46.996
Eh, just think big picture,
Booms. What's unsafe?

08:47.121 --> 08:50.436
Can you fall into any part of the
machine without hurting yourself?

08:50.561 --> 08:52.844
Reckon I would fuck
that machine up more.

08:52.876 --> 08:55.552
- Yeah, but you wouldn't get hurt because...
- What would you be... ?

08:55.566 --> 08:57.654
What would you be wearing
in the workshop, Booms?

08:57.664 --> 08:59.036
Hey, what are you smiling at?

08:59.049 --> 09:00.668
What, can't I be happy?

09:00.674 --> 09:03.447
- What, in here? Yeah, right.
- Mm-hmm.

09:03.483 --> 09:05.285
Are you gettin' ready for your test?

09:05.327 --> 09:06.971
She's gonna blitz it too, aren't you?

09:06.985 --> 09:08.974
- Yeah.
- No! I'm not.

09:09.036 --> 09:12.288
I'm gonna spend the next five
years bangin' nails into boxes.

09:12.306 --> 09:14.925
You might end up with more
responsibility than you think.

09:15.369 --> 09:19.120
Well, Sonia's not gonna be
around forever, is she? Eh?

09:24.252 --> 09:25.996
No, not today.

09:26.423 --> 09:28.557
- What do you mean, you... ?
- Well,

09:28.682 --> 09:30.673
sometimes the...

09:32.405 --> 09:34.822
OK. OK, off you go, hon.

09:34.850 --> 09:38.023
We'll talk some... later on. Good girl.

09:39.469 --> 09:42.281
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah, I need a phone.

09:42.712 --> 09:45.466
- Got a business call to make.
- When do you need it?

09:45.839 --> 09:49.121
Today if possible, but
within the next 24 hours.

09:49.511 --> 09:52.331
Kosta. She's got a phone. She
was using it for fight club.

09:52.337 --> 09:53.700
Right. Can you source it?

09:54.302 --> 09:56.552
Yeah, I can reckon I can source it.

09:57.026 --> 10:00.356
Winter, you put in a request for
some of your son's belongings?

10:00.392 --> 10:02.915
- That's right.
- Request's been denied.

10:34.495 --> 10:36.270
- Where are my girls?
- Mm...

10:36.851 --> 10:39.973
Jesus, Juice! Am I supposed to
know what that mime shit means?

10:39.991 --> 10:41.220
Go get my girls.

10:41.285 --> 10:44.550
Because I need to talk to
them, you tongueless twat!

10:48.067 --> 10:49.780
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

10:49.905 --> 10:51.318
How's your mouth?

10:51.979 --> 10:56.923
- I feel really bad about what happened.
- Oh... Oh, it's all right.

10:57.538 --> 11:00.350
Well, Monte Carlos will
still be hard but, you know...

11:01.285 --> 11:03.710
Hey, er, gummy bears.

11:04.782 --> 11:07.180
- You got nothing in your account, Boomer.
- What?

11:07.401 --> 11:09.960
Oh, that's OK. Put it on mine.

11:10.085 --> 11:11.744
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:12.016 --> 11:14.959
- Aw! Thanks, Marie!
- It's all right.

11:18.618 --> 11:20.150
Salt and vinegar?

11:20.710 --> 11:22.378
I need to replace the salt.

11:22.392 --> 11:23.977
Sweated it all out like a pig.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.870
Yeah, I can see that.

11:26.776 --> 11:30.107
Not that! Get off!

11:30.297 --> 11:31.790
Gross!

11:32.764 --> 11:34.866
- Help yourself.
- I will.

11:40.821 --> 11:42.230
What's the story there?

11:42.803 --> 11:46.110
Looks like Marie's bought
herself a new bestie.

11:47.417 --> 11:49.131
I meant with you and her.

11:51.958 --> 11:55.687
Ooh, don't give me that sexy shrug!
There's obviously a story there.

11:55.705 --> 11:58.698
Yeah, this'll last me probably
like a week or something, eh?

11:58.970 --> 12:01.503
- Thank you!
- I don't wanna bore you.

12:02.122 --> 12:05.237
Yeah, right. 'Cause you've
been boring me since day one,

12:05.251 --> 12:08.637
with your ugly mug and
your squeakin' little voice.

12:10.787 --> 12:12.990
- We had a thing.
- A thing?

12:13.030 --> 12:17.230
- Yeah, like a million years ago.
- Was it a little thaaang?

12:18.518 --> 12:20.632
Did you, like, enjoy it or... ?

12:20.683 --> 12:22.270
It was a big thang.

12:24.039 --> 12:25.790
At least, at the time it was.

12:27.991 --> 12:29.670
She break your heart, girl?

12:33.119 --> 12:34.790
She ruined my fucking life.

12:36.369 --> 12:37.935
She got me hooked on gear.

12:38.698 --> 12:41.368
I ended up turning tricks.
I was a fucking basket case

12:41.373 --> 12:42.944
- because of her.
- What?

12:42.944 --> 12:45.508
- She did all of that?
- Yeah, she did.

12:47.824 --> 12:50.740
It's like she can instantly read you,

12:50.865 --> 12:52.750
and tap into your head.

12:53.049 --> 12:55.924
It's like she knows exactly
where you're vulnerable.

12:55.942 --> 12:58.249
She uses that to get
what she wants from you.

12:58.289 --> 12:59.695
Man!

13:01.449 --> 13:03.689
She's got a voodoo vajayjay.

13:10.123 --> 13:13.085
Oh, I lost count. Seven...

13:13.329 --> 13:15.118
- Oh, Governor?
- What is it, Winter?

13:15.164 --> 13:19.009
I made a request for some personal
belongings to have in my cell.

13:19.049 --> 13:20.649
Well, it was knocked back.

13:20.689 --> 13:23.289
Well, since the escape, we've
been clamping down on privileges.

13:23.329 --> 13:25.587
Well, it's just a few things
that belonged to my son,

13:25.610 --> 13:27.596
things that are personal to me.

13:28.249 --> 13:30.853
I'm afraid I can't make
arbitrary exceptions.

13:31.289 --> 13:34.648
But there's no-one else
to maintain his memory.

13:36.009 --> 13:37.610
What about his father?

13:38.169 --> 13:39.764
It's just me.

13:40.529 --> 13:43.685
It's just a few possessions
to maintain a connection.

13:49.794 --> 13:51.561
I'm sorry. No.

13:59.089 --> 14:00.753
Come on!

14:01.296 --> 14:03.162
Bloody thing!

14:03.689 --> 14:06.269
- Ah, come on!
- Birdsworth, what are you doing?

14:07.649 --> 14:09.089
Liz!

14:15.569 --> 14:17.536
- Birdsworth, you all right?
- Yeah.

14:17.569 --> 14:21.393
- OK, take her. Stewart? Mr Stewart!
- Just take it easy.

14:21.925 --> 14:23.461
Jake.

14:25.835 --> 14:27.129
Jake!

14:36.609 --> 14:38.364
Jakey the hero!

14:38.417 --> 14:39.878
Has a ring to it.

14:41.529 --> 14:43.343
Does Mr Stewart need
to go to the hospital?

14:43.372 --> 14:46.474
- Doctor checked him out. He's got a sprained wrist...
- And Birdsworth?

14:46.529 --> 14:48.793
Fine. Mild electrical burn.

14:50.696 --> 14:52.365
- Thanks.
- For what?

14:52.386 --> 14:53.801
Mr Stewart...

14:53.807 --> 14:56.269
uh, I just wanted to say
thank you. Thank you so much.

14:56.289 --> 14:58.082
- It was nothing, Liz.
- Bullshit it was nothin'!

14:58.091 --> 15:00.470
You saved my life without
thinkin' about your own.

15:00.883 --> 15:02.585
You are a good man.

15:02.904 --> 15:04.104
Isn't he, Miss Bennett?

15:04.110 --> 15:06.309
We're probably gonna need
to do that test again, but,

15:06.315 --> 15:07.692
I mean, I'm gonna look into it.

15:07.715 --> 15:09.920
You know you could've killed
yourself, not to mention Mr Stewart.

15:09.926 --> 15:12.622
Come on, Liz! The doctor
hasn't finished with you yet.

15:14.592 --> 15:15.637
Would you have cared...

15:15.667 --> 15:17.666
- Just gonna run a few more tests, OK?
- if I was dead?

15:17.717 --> 15:19.403
- Just have to see how...
- Hey...

15:19.865 --> 15:21.579
I, uh, just heard. You OK?

15:21.594 --> 15:23.682
Where have you been? Weren't
you rostered onto H Block?

15:23.688 --> 15:25.166
- Uh, yeah...
- I swapped with him.

15:25.172 --> 15:26.372
Are you feeling anywhere else?

15:26.378 --> 15:28.349
- Will was in J Block.
- Well... well, I don't...

15:28.365 --> 15:30.569
OK, we'll finalise the
incident report later.

15:34.449 --> 15:35.744
Thanks, mate.

15:40.620 --> 15:42.599
Way braver!

15:44.088 --> 15:46.010
Allie, Allie, Allie, Allie!

15:47.133 --> 15:49.761
- I'm ready this time, I'm ready!
- Go on, Booms!

15:50.401 --> 15:55.087
We win, bitches!

15:55.360 --> 15:59.217
You wanna go again?
Huh? You want more pain?

15:59.723 --> 16:01.841
Shouldn't you be studying, Booms?

16:02.633 --> 16:03.907
Nuh.

16:04.929 --> 16:06.129
Anyone?

16:07.850 --> 16:09.172
Anyone? Oh...

16:11.786 --> 16:12.976
What do you want?

16:13.264 --> 16:15.470
You know where Kosta stashes her phone?

16:16.128 --> 16:17.167
Why would I know that?

16:17.237 --> 16:19.006
You were in with her
over that fight club.

16:19.046 --> 16:21.246
Ew! I wasn't in with Kosta's mob.

16:21.590 --> 16:22.835
I haven't got a bloody clue.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.975
And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

16:26.752 --> 16:27.960
Hey.

16:29.631 --> 16:30.928
What's the go there?

16:33.725 --> 16:34.764
No idea.

16:44.535 --> 16:46.582
Danny loved his basketball.

16:46.593 --> 16:48.892
Remember how you used
to call him Danny Jordan?

16:48.940 --> 16:50.240
What's the go with Taylor?

16:50.953 --> 16:53.037
- Sweet kid.
- Yeah.

16:53.553 --> 16:56.855
Young, pretty, impressionable.

16:57.553 --> 17:00.416
- Just your type.
- Hey, I'm just trying to make friends.

17:01.313 --> 17:03.307
I would prefer that friend to be you,

17:03.321 --> 17:05.925
but something tells
me that other parties

17:06.329 --> 17:08.433
are determined for that not to happen.

17:08.590 --> 17:12.223
- Don't make this about Kaz.
- This? What is this?

17:13.473 --> 17:16.710
You know, apart from Danny,
you're the only person I let in.

17:18.713 --> 17:21.045
You know what really confuses me

17:21.406 --> 17:23.731
is that you said I was too
controlling, but then you went

17:23.739 --> 17:26.732
and left me for a woman
who ran a vigilante cult.

17:26.765 --> 17:30.040
I didn't leave you for Kaz,
she rescued me from you!

17:30.062 --> 17:32.948
I rescued you from the streets.

17:33.153 --> 17:36.113
But Kaz has made you think
that I was exploiting you.

17:36.238 --> 17:38.067
But she's the one who
did the brainwashing,

17:38.078 --> 17:40.310
she is the one who put you in prison.

17:40.553 --> 17:41.859
She didn't brainwash me.

17:42.047 --> 17:43.228
Yes, she did.

17:43.252 --> 17:45.193
God, everything that we had,

17:45.233 --> 17:47.760
Kaz had made you see
it through her eyes.

17:48.713 --> 17:53.237
And she's still deciding who
you can and can't associate with.

17:53.993 --> 17:56.093
I decide who my friends are, Marie.

18:10.350 --> 18:12.168
_

18:21.473 --> 18:22.616
Fuck!

18:24.553 --> 18:25.909
Oi!

18:26.353 --> 18:28.884
Help! Shit!

18:28.913 --> 18:32.938
Hey, let me out! Get me
out of here! Fuck off!

18:40.273 --> 18:42.088
Ah, fu... !

19:18.193 --> 19:20.666
Why don't you think
you'll be a good mum?

19:21.113 --> 19:23.087
I didn't have much of a role model.

19:25.593 --> 19:26.793
And, um...

19:31.193 --> 19:34.895
And that the idea of being...

19:36.360 --> 19:40.583
responsible for something so fragile...

19:41.433 --> 19:42.633
Scares you?

19:44.122 --> 19:46.765
- _
- Raising a child...

19:49.593 --> 19:50.793
on my own...

19:52.233 --> 19:53.553
with zero support...

19:56.113 --> 19:58.073
that... that scares me.

20:00.009 --> 20:02.740
_

20:13.244 --> 20:15.530
You wanted to see me, Governor?

20:16.096 --> 20:19.343
Ah, Marie Winter put in a request
for some of her son's belongings.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.050
We knocked her back,
as per the new protocol.

20:21.074 --> 20:23.579
- I'm making an exception in this case.
- You really wanna do that?

20:23.588 --> 20:25.362
Just authorise it, Miss Miles.

20:25.972 --> 20:27.505
OK.

20:31.377 --> 20:33.410
_

20:42.506 --> 20:45.006
Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

20:45.029 --> 20:47.633
H Block are now called for breakfast.

20:47.673 --> 20:50.194
The reporters will be here at 2pm today,

20:50.208 --> 20:53.044
so I need you to have
things running like clockwork

20:53.067 --> 20:54.282
so I can deal with the press.

20:54.319 --> 20:56.190
You sure I can handle it? 'Cause, like,

20:56.264 --> 20:58.195
I haven't got my ticket or nothin'.

20:58.227 --> 21:01.900
Don't be silly. Just study hard
and you will pass the test. Lucy.

21:02.071 --> 21:04.270
2pm today, Ms Bennett's
given permission for you

21:04.275 --> 21:05.661
- to be in the workshop.
- Hm.

21:05.684 --> 21:07.708
There's $50 in it for you.

21:08.817 --> 21:12.494
Oi! Why do you want that lardass
anywhere near our workshop?

21:12.526 --> 21:16.036
Trust me, Susan, hm? There
is method in my madness.

21:16.073 --> 21:19.673
Hey, Rita! Come sit
with us. Much more fun.

21:19.798 --> 21:21.141
I bet you are.

21:22.005 --> 21:23.497
Boring!

21:34.353 --> 21:36.539
You can't let her worm
her way back in, Bubba.

21:36.544 --> 21:38.294
We both know why she's here.

21:38.826 --> 21:42.725
Actually, she's in here
because her son died, Danny.

21:43.293 --> 21:45.396
She lost it when she had to
turn off his life support,

21:45.410 --> 21:46.753
and she bashed the doctor.

21:46.793 --> 21:50.316
Whatever the reason, it doesn't
change what the fuck she is,

21:50.325 --> 21:53.176
a corrupter of vulnerable young women.

21:53.353 --> 21:56.755
Marie Winter fucks up lives.

22:03.273 --> 22:04.473
Liz!

22:05.675 --> 22:06.876
Come sit down.

22:33.979 --> 22:35.457
When can you get it in?

22:35.513 --> 22:38.053
How much? I'll bring
it in the usual way.

22:38.273 --> 22:39.938
I'll worry about that, OK?

22:39.957 --> 22:42.022
You just call me back
when you get sorted.

22:45.459 --> 22:48.175
Bank this. Tell me when he calls back.

22:50.355 --> 22:52.498
She wants to know if it's on vibrate.

22:52.913 --> 22:55.062
Oi, you better have reception up there!

23:03.442 --> 23:05.461
You wanna know where Kosta's phone is?

23:06.477 --> 23:08.001
Up Lucy's fork.

23:09.281 --> 23:11.087
Good luck trying to get that.

23:14.811 --> 23:16.996
- Here you go, Governor.
- They all been checked?

23:17.014 --> 23:19.167
- Checked and cleared.
- Thank you.

23:45.454 --> 23:47.468
You can wait outside, Mr Jackson.

23:52.550 --> 23:54.693
Thank you. I really appreciate this.

23:58.647 --> 24:00.605
You kept all those things.

24:03.349 --> 24:05.150
I suppose that's what a mother does.

24:07.645 --> 24:10.907
Well, I was actually
never very maternal.

24:12.080 --> 24:14.193
But I'll always be
grateful that I had Danny.

24:16.931 --> 24:18.737
He made me a better person.

24:24.823 --> 24:27.089
God, he had this since he was a baby.

24:27.943 --> 24:30.073
Roger the Dodger!

24:33.232 --> 24:34.950
His dad gave him this.

24:35.075 --> 24:36.844
I was under the impression that...

24:36.903 --> 24:39.860
Oh, well, he wasn't really
part of our lives, eh?

24:42.323 --> 24:44.443
He just wasn't the sort of man

24:44.457 --> 24:46.549
that I wanted Danny
to look up to, really.

24:46.903 --> 24:49.141
So you decided to raise him on your own.

24:50.023 --> 24:51.223
Yeah.

24:54.623 --> 24:56.814
Although that may have been a mistake.

24:58.183 --> 25:00.510
- Why?
- Well, I shut him out.

25:02.263 --> 25:04.017
He could've been a great dad.

25:09.930 --> 25:11.736
I guess I'll never know.

25:38.889 --> 25:42.302
You probably think I'm
silly, wanting all this stuff.

25:42.371 --> 25:44.926
No, whatever helps to ease the pain.

25:45.138 --> 25:48.626
Thanks, Will. Oh, sorry... Mr Jackson.

26:32.149 --> 26:34.744
- Oh, shit! Get out of my way!
- I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it!

26:34.758 --> 26:36.753
- All right, here, here, here, go. Oh!
- Out, out!

26:36.790 --> 26:38.153
- You got it?
- Oh, no!

26:38.167 --> 26:39.816
Any luck with the phone?

26:39.858 --> 26:42.232
I'm working on it. It's...

26:42.795 --> 26:45.582
- slightly tricky.
- I need it today.

26:45.707 --> 26:47.083
Yeah, righto.

26:47.111 --> 26:48.723
Fuck, yeah!

26:53.218 --> 26:54.623
You mind if I sit?

26:54.937 --> 26:56.383
No.

27:03.470 --> 27:04.735
Are you OK?

27:04.754 --> 27:06.643
- Get it!
- Ohh!

27:08.385 --> 27:11.406
I've just been going over all of
the shit that went down between us,

27:11.415 --> 27:12.671
when we were together.

27:12.676 --> 27:14.598
And did you figure anything out?

27:15.924 --> 27:17.901
You didn't hold a gun to my head.

27:18.268 --> 27:21.023
Just a needle to your vein.

27:21.929 --> 27:23.228
No.

27:25.146 --> 27:28.370
I did that to myself.
Can't blame you for that...

27:29.023 --> 27:30.648
as much as I'd like to.

27:35.208 --> 27:37.660
God, you're not still self-conscious?

27:37.785 --> 27:39.914
- No.
- The Johns went crazy for that.

27:42.225 --> 27:45.989
♪Happy birthday... Mr President. ♪

27:46.155 --> 27:49.601
♪ Happy birthday to you... ♪

27:50.977 --> 27:53.139
- Oh, God, so gross.
- Sick gross.

27:55.390 --> 27:57.339
You were pretty special.

27:58.351 --> 28:01.223
You know you're the only one
that I ever gave my heart to?

28:04.087 --> 28:05.543
Really?

28:07.381 --> 28:09.686
And you've turned into quite something.

28:10.143 --> 28:12.642
I wish Danny was here to see you now.

28:13.151 --> 28:14.680
What, in here?

28:14.744 --> 28:17.526
Doing 10 years for
assault and kidnapping?

28:17.558 --> 28:18.903
Sweetheart...

28:20.057 --> 28:22.266
this place doesn't define you.

28:28.318 --> 28:30.022
I'll catch you later.

28:34.190 --> 28:36.601
All right, all right. Ready?

28:36.623 --> 28:38.864
And through the middle,
through the middle!

29:29.529 --> 29:31.917
That's it, well done, darling.

29:38.621 --> 29:41.429
Hey, thanks, hon, you go get
yourself cleaned up, will you?

29:47.796 --> 29:50.258
You might wanna give this a wipe, too.

29:51.464 --> 29:54.194
Well done. Keep an eye out, would ya?

29:55.109 --> 29:56.560
Thanks.

30:07.066 --> 30:09.583
Dominic? Hi. It's Marie Winter.

30:12.231 --> 30:15.954
We have around 30 women working
in this part of the workshop.

30:15.977 --> 30:18.370
Look past the labels that
have been placed on them.

30:18.439 --> 30:22.353
Bludgers, no-hopers, a
drain on the public purse...

30:22.768 --> 30:24.437
I won't be a minute.

30:24.608 --> 30:26.123
- You're late.
- Mmm.

30:26.160 --> 30:27.560
What are you wearing?

30:28.904 --> 30:31.181
Never mind, just start
packing those boxes, will you?

30:31.218 --> 30:33.478
Money later. Get to work!

30:34.642 --> 30:36.504
What do you think about working here?

30:36.582 --> 30:39.899
This is Lucy Gambaro, she's
one of our disabled girls.

30:39.935 --> 30:41.534
- What the fuck!
- On the outside,

30:41.538 --> 30:44.246
she would simply be tossed onto
the scrapheap, wouldn't you, Lucy?

30:44.273 --> 30:46.800
But here, she's a valued
member of our team.

30:46.842 --> 30:49.937
- Get fucked!
- Much like Susan Jenkins over here.

30:50.275 --> 30:53.393
Intellectually impaired,
practically unemployable.

30:53.518 --> 30:55.573
But you see, I choose to see

30:55.582 --> 30:59.417
what these unfortunate women can become

30:59.463 --> 31:02.956
if they're only given
a chance to... shine.

31:03.023 --> 31:06.052
- What's her name, Jenkins?
- Yeah, Susan Jenkins.

31:06.232 --> 31:09.752
- She answers to, um... "Boomer".
- Right.

31:12.524 --> 31:14.626
- Birdsworth?
- Here!

31:15.785 --> 31:17.564
You gonna fuck that kettle up, too?

31:17.804 --> 31:19.227
You're supposed to be at work unit.

31:19.291 --> 31:21.301
But you might wanna get changed first.

31:25.274 --> 31:27.408
Yeah, just over here, thanks, Sonia.

31:28.466 --> 31:31.224
- Yeah, that's terrific.
- Give us a smile.

31:33.403 --> 31:34.854
- Now one with Ms Bennett?
- Yes.

31:34.877 --> 31:36.767
Can we get a photo of
the governor and Sonia?

31:36.827 --> 31:38.449
Oh, certainly.

31:38.740 --> 31:41.497
Perfect, that's great. Smiling this way.

31:41.516 --> 31:44.698
- Looking good, ladies.
- Over here! Yes, let's go!

31:47.775 --> 31:51.119
- Oh, Liz, Liz?
- And what do you do here, ma'am?

31:51.179 --> 31:53.120
Oh, Liz doesn't
actually, uh, belong here,

31:53.138 --> 31:54.548
she works in the seedling area.

31:54.585 --> 31:56.363
And what do you think of Sonia Stevens?

31:56.557 --> 31:58.003
Sonia?

32:08.064 --> 32:09.703
Sonia's an angel.

32:23.965 --> 32:26.621
What the fuck are you wearing?

32:26.944 --> 32:29.437
Hey... has he called back yet?

32:29.562 --> 32:32.491
What do you mean, stolen?

32:33.267 --> 32:35.437
How the fuck did they steal
it from up your gash, huh?

32:37.174 --> 32:38.782
Hey, Vic!

32:38.907 --> 32:41.240
Saw this scrag in the
visitors this mornin'.

32:41.277 --> 32:43.410
Meeting some random, getting gear.

32:43.443 --> 32:45.789
Who'd you score for, blondie?

32:47.544 --> 32:49.175
Watch for screws.

32:51.355 --> 32:53.074
Who'd you bring in gear for, huh?

32:55.458 --> 32:57.468
Tell me, little Taylah...

32:57.593 --> 32:59.583
or I'll cut your pretty face!

32:59.623 --> 33:03.151
Make you look like
Cherry... not so pretty.

33:04.911 --> 33:06.805
Marie... it was Marie.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.703
- Winter?
- Yeah.

33:11.003 --> 33:12.916
- Fuck!
- You wanna get to Winter?

33:12.953 --> 33:15.693
Just take out her bitch
of a bodyguard first.

33:17.998 --> 33:20.455
Hey... hey.

33:20.580 --> 33:22.978
Ah, Marie wants to see you, dining room.

33:29.367 --> 33:30.700
Marie?

33:32.278 --> 33:33.620
Marie?

33:36.140 --> 33:37.609
What's happening?

33:37.734 --> 33:39.004
Girls?

33:39.980 --> 33:41.940
Multicultural convention, eh?

33:41.980 --> 33:43.826
Let me welcome you to country.

34:07.390 --> 34:08.857
- That'll do, Connors!
- You!

34:08.886 --> 34:10.380
That's enough!

34:11.940 --> 34:15.108
Sierra six to medical, we require
assistance in the dining room.

34:15.118 --> 34:16.940
Copy that, Sierra six, on our way.

34:16.965 --> 34:19.395
You're gonna have a nice,
long stay in the slot.

34:19.427 --> 34:22.005
Four-to-one, and you're gonna slot me?

34:22.088 --> 34:23.672
Last man standing, Connors.

34:23.797 --> 34:25.552
Pretty impressive, though.

34:33.059 --> 34:34.670
Will?

34:38.177 --> 34:39.559
Will?

34:42.187 --> 34:43.728
Oi!

34:44.739 --> 34:46.165
Go home.

34:46.539 --> 34:47.940
What?

34:48.820 --> 34:50.779
Go... home.

34:53.047 --> 34:54.438
I can't...

34:54.793 --> 34:57.464
I'm still halfway through
my shift at medical.

34:59.500 --> 35:00.965
Look, I'm done.

35:01.039 --> 35:02.827
I'll cover the rest of your shift.

35:02.860 --> 35:05.060
Just go home and get
some proper sleep, mate.

35:07.620 --> 35:08.820
Cheers.

35:33.380 --> 35:34.620
What are you doing here?

35:35.022 --> 35:36.588
Where's Will?

35:45.682 --> 35:48.477
_

35:51.900 --> 35:54.155
_

35:55.587 --> 35:57.661
_

36:02.428 --> 36:04.059
_

36:46.660 --> 36:48.270
Good morning.

36:51.079 --> 36:53.300
Morning.

36:55.820 --> 36:57.333
Mr Stewart.

36:57.700 --> 37:00.438
You swapped another shift
with Will Jackson last night.

37:00.700 --> 37:03.140
- Yeah, that's right.
- The second in two days.

37:03.265 --> 37:06.629
On both occasions, you failed
to amend the official roster.

37:07.180 --> 37:08.798
Well, as deputy governor,

37:08.806 --> 37:10.316
- that's Will's...
- I'm under enough pressure as it is.

37:10.340 --> 37:12.932
If anything happens and my staff
aren't where they're meant to be,

37:12.956 --> 37:15.329
- that comes back on me.
- Right, it won't happen again.

37:16.911 --> 37:21.335
You are symptomatic of all of
the bad choices I have ever made.

37:21.354 --> 37:22.900
- What?
- Because of you...

37:24.223 --> 37:26.041
I question every decision.

37:37.683 --> 37:39.100
I'm here as peer worker.

37:44.597 --> 37:46.866
Your fight with Rita,
what was that about?

37:46.929 --> 37:48.090
It was over drugs.

37:48.130 --> 37:49.180
Drugs?

37:51.020 --> 37:53.921
I heard Marie Winter was
bringing gear into the prison.

37:54.320 --> 37:57.650
Knowing how you feel about drugs,
I confronted her bodyguard about it.

37:57.668 --> 37:58.749
She beat me up,

37:58.935 --> 38:01.877
- told me to keep my fucking trap shut.
- Don't give me that shit.

38:02.077 --> 38:04.128
You don't believe me? Ask Taylah.

38:10.014 --> 38:12.709
- You wanted to see me?
- Shut the door.

38:16.160 --> 38:19.173
Um, look... before you say anything...

38:19.184 --> 38:21.140
Now swapping shifts is one thing.

38:21.313 --> 38:23.682
But not bothering to amend the roster?

38:23.704 --> 38:26.150
It contravenes work practice,
not to mention leaving us open

38:26.180 --> 38:27.817
for potential scrutiny we don't need.

38:27.891 --> 38:30.640
Why did you even let Jake swap shifts?

38:32.620 --> 38:34.575
Is there...

38:34.912 --> 38:37.998
some reason you know he wanted
to work in medical last night?

38:38.123 --> 38:39.975
I was the one who swapped shifts.

38:41.372 --> 38:42.666
Why?

38:43.061 --> 38:44.576
I, um...

38:45.515 --> 38:47.620
I just haven't been
sleeping too well lately.

38:47.780 --> 38:50.190
Jake was covering for me... both times.

38:50.223 --> 38:51.871
Will, what is going on?

38:52.522 --> 38:55.197
I mean, are there issues here
at work we need to discuss?

38:55.219 --> 38:58.216
- I know it's not easy working with Jake...
- It's not Jake.

39:02.007 --> 39:03.431
Well, what is it, then?

39:06.369 --> 39:08.328
Clearly something's bothering you.

39:17.245 --> 39:18.380
Will?

39:27.810 --> 39:30.714
You know I'm here for you, after
everything you have done for me?

39:30.751 --> 39:32.296
I'll always have your back.

39:36.534 --> 39:37.924
Not this time.

39:38.534 --> 39:40.718
You know anything you say in this room

39:40.729 --> 39:42.580
is strictly confidential? You know that?

39:50.163 --> 39:51.677
It can't be that bad...

39:53.207 --> 39:54.696
but I'm also your friend.

39:57.349 --> 39:58.806
Governor, have you seen
the paper this morning?

39:58.813 --> 40:00.668
- Get out! Go!
- Sorry, I just thought...

40:03.426 --> 40:05.314
- Yeah, I need to get back to work.
- No,

40:05.340 --> 40:07.660
- Will, I...
- Look, I'm sorry, Vera. I'm OK.

40:07.890 --> 40:10.614
It's just insomnia, I've seen a
doc, he's given me something to take.

40:10.618 --> 40:12.576
- Will...
- I'm all right.

40:18.660 --> 40:20.110
What the hell was that about?

40:20.472 --> 40:21.769
I didn't tell her anything.

40:22.042 --> 40:23.133
Good.

40:23.676 --> 40:26.026
You need to get a grip, if you
can't sleep, go see a doctor,

40:26.045 --> 40:28.388
- get some pills or something.
- I've taken a shitload.

40:29.031 --> 40:30.708
It's not fucking working.

40:35.492 --> 40:37.824
_

40:38.424 --> 40:39.499
OK...

40:39.725 --> 40:42.135
"List all of the protective clothing

40:42.198 --> 40:44.309
that you must wear when
using the machinery?"

40:44.329 --> 40:47.389
Uh, spats, gloves,

40:47.954 --> 40:49.285
boots...

40:49.883 --> 40:51.260
Welders' beanie?

40:51.517 --> 40:53.117
A mask?

40:53.579 --> 40:57.966
Um, apron... What's this shit?

40:58.041 --> 40:59.583
You forgot long-sleeved shirt.

40:59.600 --> 41:02.112
What is this... this shit?!

41:03.197 --> 41:07.349
"Champion of the oppressed, Sonia
Stevens with intellectually disabled

41:07.372 --> 41:09.860
- "Susan "Boomer" Jenkins."
- Fuck off!

41:10.277 --> 41:12.067
Oh, God...

41:12.818 --> 41:15.249
Look, look, look! Look
what they called me!

41:15.267 --> 41:17.993
Fuckin' intellectually disabled!

41:18.889 --> 41:21.656
Oh, Susan that is dreadful.

41:21.674 --> 41:23.416
Why... why... why would they say that?

41:23.476 --> 41:25.001
That's just the press for you.

41:25.024 --> 41:27.034
They're always looking
for a cheap angle.

41:27.061 --> 41:28.664
I could... I could sue
'em for that, couldn't I?

41:28.687 --> 41:30.623
Yes. Indeed you could.

41:31.205 --> 41:32.776
I'll get my lawyers onto it.

41:33.011 --> 41:34.519
Oh, fuck me!

41:34.525 --> 41:36.522
- Boomer, you need to concentrate.
- I can't!

41:36.536 --> 41:39.127
Boomer, you've got your
bloody test tomorrow.

41:39.164 --> 41:42.823
Intellectually disabled... like, mongy!

41:45.627 --> 41:47.414
Oh, ladies.

41:47.645 --> 41:49.715
You're just in time for morning tea.

41:49.840 --> 41:51.151
How do you take it?

41:51.197 --> 41:53.452
I've just been speaking to Taylah.

41:54.727 --> 41:58.228
- Doesn't say much, does she?
- Oh, she said enough.

41:59.458 --> 42:00.700
Is it true?

42:05.624 --> 42:07.348
I bet that fills you with joy?

42:07.366 --> 42:09.288
I won't be happy till you're gone.

42:09.694 --> 42:12.369
Until then, if I catch you using girls

42:12.392 --> 42:13.976
- as drug mules again...
- "Using girls"?

42:14.000 --> 42:15.870
- Manipulating them...
- You call yourself a feminist,

42:15.880 --> 42:17.330
but then you assume that these women

42:17.340 --> 42:18.946
are dumb and can't
make up their own minds.

42:18.970 --> 42:21.844
It's not like I hypnotise them.

42:22.305 --> 42:25.715
Do it again, and I'll fucking
destroy you. Understand?

42:28.284 --> 42:29.452
Hm.

42:30.612 --> 42:33.003
That was a little frosty.

42:42.587 --> 42:44.623
What happened? It was a set-up.

42:44.956 --> 42:46.223
Everyone's busted.

42:46.275 --> 42:48.785
- We've got a fucking rat.
- Shit... !

42:51.889 --> 42:57.126
OK. List three methods of
communication in the workshop.

42:59.365 --> 43:03.057
I don't know. Screaming, shouting...

43:03.616 --> 43:05.234
Bit of this... ?

43:05.577 --> 43:07.735
- Where's Allie?
- Don't ask me.

43:08.796 --> 43:10.256
I'm a fucking retard.

43:10.296 --> 43:11.296
Liz?

43:12.424 --> 43:14.660
Hey? What is wrong?

43:15.616 --> 43:17.040
Liz...

43:17.336 --> 43:19.199
Sonia killed Sharon Gilmour.

43:19.853 --> 43:22.228
- What?
- I think she thought Shaz was me.

43:22.302 --> 43:25.003
- What are you talking about?
- Sonia always knew I was Witness X

43:25.015 --> 43:26.921
'cause she planned
the whole thing, right?

43:26.936 --> 43:28.938
That's why I had to try to poison her,

43:28.949 --> 43:32.131
to kill her before she
killed me. But she didn't die!

43:32.153 --> 43:34.577
No, she came back from the fuckin' dead!

43:34.616 --> 43:36.936
Now I'm so afraid, Kaz.

43:36.976 --> 43:39.141
I'm so bloody afraid.

43:39.462 --> 43:42.363
- Sh... it's OK. It's OK.
- God...

43:44.739 --> 43:46.416
Oh, God.

43:46.456 --> 43:48.430
I don't know what's wrong with me.

43:51.242 --> 43:54.091
I put my hair brush in the fridge.

43:59.055 --> 44:00.766
I think I'm losing my mind.

44:04.105 --> 44:05.428
Oh, Lizzie...

44:09.800 --> 44:11.685
I think I'm losing my mind...

44:20.615 --> 44:22.507
Up you get, Connors, let's go.

44:22.721 --> 44:23.730
You're letting me out?

44:23.734 --> 44:25.725
Cops wanna question you
over Kosta's assault.

44:31.205 --> 44:32.343
Take a seat.

44:35.714 --> 44:38.504
That number you gave
us, Dominic Pasquale.

44:38.892 --> 44:40.933
We put a watch out on
him and it came up trumps.

44:40.962 --> 44:43.390
Shipping container. 12 Asian girls.

44:43.409 --> 44:46.187
Seven arrests, including
Pasquale and Winter's associate,

44:46.224 --> 44:47.488
Zara Dragovic.

44:47.499 --> 44:49.125
But we still haven't got a clue

44:49.144 --> 44:51.283
who Winter's protector
is and that's who we want.

44:51.331 --> 44:52.891
We reckon it's someone in government.

44:52.975 --> 44:54.414
Maybe even the force.

44:55.308 --> 44:57.482
Want you to get this

44:57.944 --> 44:59.581
into Winter's phone,

44:59.648 --> 45:01.574
that way we can monitor it 24/7.

45:01.581 --> 45:03.779
Sooner or later she'll call the bastard.

45:15.986 --> 45:17.328
Good work, Detective.

45:23.738 --> 45:26.037
Dragovic? What's the story?

45:26.791 --> 45:28.343
As far as we can tell...
