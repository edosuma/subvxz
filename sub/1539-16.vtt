<i>Previously on Gotham...</i>

00:02.601 --> 00:04.134
I start a new job in the morning.

00:04.200 --> 00:05.367
A new job?! Congratulations!

00:05.402 --> 00:07.503
I'm coming to work at the GCPD.

00:07.537 --> 00:09.338
I'm your new medical examiner.

00:09.372 --> 00:11.574
I have some questions I need to
ask the members of the board.

00:11.608 --> 00:13.509
- What kind of questions?
- About Arkham.

00:13.543 --> 00:15.311
It seems very likely those gangsters

00:15.345 --> 00:16.679
are actually given their shares in Arkham

00:16.713 --> 00:18.414
by Wayne Enterprises.

00:18.448 --> 00:20.616
This nightclub makes a lot of money.

00:20.650 --> 00:23.052
That's why I want to re-open
it under your care.

00:23.086 --> 00:25.921
- I can have the club?
- You're with me now.

00:25.956 --> 00:27.957

Hi.

Where's Jim?

02:37.153 --> 02:40.355
He dropped off his keys, like, last week.

02:49.998 --> 02:51.999

No reason.

I don't like him.

I will slap you silly.

05:46.607 --> 05:47.607
You wish.

05:47.641 --> 05:48.608
Don't think I can't.

05:48.642 --> 05:49.976
Whoa, kids.

05:50.010 --> 05:51.844
What's the big problem, anyhow?

05:51.878 --> 05:53.546
The Graysons are a bunch
of arrogant buttheads

05:53.580 --> 05:55.748
- is the problem.
- The Lloyds are feckless drunkards,

05:55.782 --> 05:57.383
is more like it.

05:57.417 --> 05:59.018
So it's a family feud.

05:59.052 --> 06:00.619
Graysons don't get along with Lloyds.

06:00.654 --> 06:02.521
Been that way for years.

06:02.556 --> 06:03.823
It's sort of a tradition.

06:03.857 --> 06:05.624
You guys fight like this every night?

06:05.659 --> 06:07.259
No.

06:07.294 --> 06:09.562
That was just her idiot uncle
doing his thing.

06:09.596 --> 06:11.463
You know damn well it must be Lila's fault.

06:12.532 --> 06:13.933
- Mary...
- What?

06:18.939 --> 06:20.673
GORDON: Hey.

06:20.707 --> 06:22.641
Sorry the date went south.

06:22.676 --> 06:23.709
Are you kidding?

06:23.743 --> 06:24.710
Best date ever.

06:24.744 --> 06:26.345
Who gets to see a circus brawl?

06:26.379 --> 06:27.513
True.

06:27.547 --> 06:29.348
None of them will talk, of course.

06:29.382 --> 06:31.617
So I've no idea what
those two were fighting over.

06:31.651 --> 06:33.552
I think they're rival lovers.

06:33.586 --> 06:35.821
Their families have been
fighting since way back,

06:35.855 --> 06:37.489
but this particular fight was

06:37.524 --> 06:39.458
apparently over a woman named Lila.

06:39.492 --> 06:42.294
She's a snake dancer in the sideshow.

06:42.328 --> 06:43.729
- Wow.
- I know.

06:43.763 --> 06:45.430
How cool is that? A snake dancer.

06:45.465 --> 06:47.566
No, I mean, wow, you're really good.

06:47.600 --> 06:50.302
- People talk to doctors.
- I guess so.

06:50.336 --> 06:52.003
I should find this woman
Lila, make sure she's okay.

06:52.038 --> 06:53.538
Might take a little awhile.

06:53.573 --> 06:54.673
I'll have a patrolman drive you home.

06:54.707 --> 06:57.476
Oh... I could come with you.

06:57.510 --> 06:59.711
Lee, this is police business.

06:59.745 --> 07:01.780
Come on, Jim.

07:01.814 --> 07:02.981
I'm dying to meet Lila.

07:03.015 --> 07:04.482
(laughs)

07:04.517 --> 07:07.485
Well, bringing along medical personnel

07:07.520 --> 07:08.687
is a justifiable precaution,

07:08.721 --> 07:10.455
- I guess.
- There you go.

07:11.490 --> 07:14.859
Sir... where's Lila?

07:14.894 --> 07:16.261
Lila?

07:16.295 --> 07:18.329
The Snake Dancer.

07:26.505 --> 07:27.939
(knocking on door)

07:32.945 --> 07:33.945
GCPD.

07:33.979 --> 07:35.346
We need to speak with Lila.

07:35.381 --> 07:37.515
She's not here.

07:37.549 --> 07:38.916
Why? What's happened?

07:38.951 --> 07:40.351
Where is she?

07:40.386 --> 07:42.987
Uh, I don't know.

07:43.021 --> 07:44.589
She was supposed to be home ages ago.

07:44.623 --> 07:45.623
You a relative?

07:45.657 --> 07:47.925
Uh, I'm her son... Jerome.

07:47.960 --> 07:50.595
Jerome, when did you last see her?

07:50.629 --> 07:52.563
This morning.

07:52.598 --> 07:54.465
She was here when I left for the library.

07:54.499 --> 07:56.767
Relax, Jerome, this gentleman is just here

07:56.802 --> 07:58.469
because Owen and Al had a disagreement.

07:58.503 --> 08:01.672
Your mother's fine,
gone on a spree, no doubt.

08:01.707 --> 08:03.774
- You know how she is.
- JEROME: A spree?

08:03.809 --> 08:06.944
Without her hat, her coat or her purse?

08:08.013 --> 08:10.748
And look at Sheba.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.249
She's distraught.

08:12.284 --> 08:13.517
She knows something's wrong.

08:13.552 --> 08:15.786
The snake does seem to be agitated.

08:15.820 --> 08:17.955
RINGMASTER: Sir... (chuckles quietly)

08:17.989 --> 08:19.523
she's what you call a party girl.

08:19.557 --> 08:21.358
Back in the morning with her knickers

08:21.393 --> 08:23.394
in a handbag, sure as eggs.

08:23.428 --> 08:25.696
But she didn't take her handbag, did she?

08:26.965 --> 08:29.933
How fast does an animal like that move?

08:29.968 --> 08:32.436
Oh, fast walking pace.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.770
They rely on surprise, mainly.

08:34.806 --> 08:36.405
Let her out.

08:37.775 --> 08:38.741
I'm sorry?

08:38.775 --> 08:40.943

Look at me.

09:55.352 --> 09:57.687
She was like that when we found her.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.375
Let's talk straight.

10:11.010 --> 10:14.478
Those people out there
are using us as transplant donors.

10:14.512 --> 10:18.115
We are simply spare parts.

10:27.759 --> 10:30.961
But you must do exactly what I say.

10:30.995 --> 10:33.463
You do as I say, and I promise you,

10:33.498 --> 10:35.599
I will get some of us out of here alive.

10:35.633 --> 10:36.700
That's right.

10:36.734 --> 10:39.469
No, you heard me correctly.

10:39.504 --> 10:43.206
I said, <i>some...</i> of us.

10:43.241 --> 10:47.744
Because the truth of the
matter is some will die.

10:49.313 --> 10:52.215
But we will die with dignity.

10:52.250 --> 10:54.317
We will die for a reason,

10:54.352 --> 10:56.486
and we will die next to family,

10:56.521 --> 10:59.322
and I tell you what... we are family.

10:59.357 --> 11:02.325
We're all we got.

11:02.360 --> 11:05.328
That's family!

11:05.363 --> 11:08.298
We have one simple choice:

11:08.332 --> 11:11.535
we die here alone on our knees

11:11.569 --> 11:16.139
or we stand up and we fight
with our family!

11:16.173 --> 11:17.741
(cheering, excited chatter)

11:25.983 --> 11:29.119
A couple of riggers found her right here.

11:29.153 --> 11:30.987
We decided to hide her on the truck.

11:31.022 --> 11:32.422
We were going to give her

11:32.456 --> 11:34.658
a proper burial as soon as
we got back on the road.

11:34.692 --> 11:36.559
Decent of you.

11:36.594 --> 11:38.228
Who's "we"? Who else knew?

11:38.262 --> 11:39.963
Just me and the head of the families.

11:39.997 --> 11:42.665
If an outsider killed her, what can you do?

11:42.700 --> 11:44.100
An act of God.

11:44.135 --> 11:46.136
If it was one of us,

11:46.170 --> 11:48.071
we always find out.

11:48.105 --> 11:50.106
And we make sure they're punished.

11:50.141 --> 11:51.341
How?

11:51.375 --> 11:53.376
We have our ways.

11:53.411 --> 11:55.178
And we have ours.

11:55.212 --> 11:56.446
Hook him up.

11:56.480 --> 11:57.480
(handcuffs clicking)

12:09.660 --> 12:12.428
Morning, partner.

12:12.463 --> 12:14.097
Gonna need a little help here.

12:14.131 --> 12:15.365
No kidding.

12:15.399 --> 12:16.933
I mean, you're kidding, right?

12:16.967 --> 12:20.103
This isn't an elaborate prank or...?

12:24.341 --> 12:27.544
Tell me about your mother, Jerome.

12:29.580 --> 12:32.282
She's my mother.

12:32.316 --> 12:34.117
What can I say? I love her.

12:34.151 --> 12:36.519
She's perfect.

12:37.555 --> 12:39.556
Not a very good cook.

12:39.590 --> 12:42.558
Except for that...

12:42.593 --> 12:44.494
Did she have any enemies?

12:44.528 --> 12:45.962
Someone with a grudge?

12:45.996 --> 12:49.032
No.

12:49.066 --> 12:50.700
Boyfriends?

12:50.734 --> 12:51.701
No.

12:51.735 --> 12:54.037
No?

12:54.071 --> 12:56.673
She had lovers.

12:56.707 --> 13:00.443
They're sex partners
really, but not boyfriends.

13:00.477 --> 13:02.078
She didn't want the commitment.

13:02.112 --> 13:03.279
Alphonse Grayson?

13:03.314 --> 13:04.580
Yes, he was one of them.

13:04.615 --> 13:06.149
Owen Lloyd?

13:06.183 --> 13:08.685
Yes.

13:08.719 --> 13:09.686
Any others?

13:09.720 --> 13:12.956
Not that I could put a name to.

13:12.990 --> 13:17.560
How do you feel about
your mother's love life?

13:17.594 --> 13:21.297
I feel fine about it.

13:21.332 --> 13:23.132
If not for my mother's love life,

13:23.167 --> 13:24.534
I wouldn't be here, would I?

13:24.568 --> 13:28.104
Sex is a healthy human activity.

13:28.138 --> 13:30.006
Yes, it is.

13:32.009 --> 13:33.943
Do you have any other family?

13:33.978 --> 13:37.647
The circus is my family.

13:39.550 --> 13:42.018
One more time. Why did
you assault Mr. Grayson?

13:42.052 --> 13:43.052
You know why.

13:43.087 --> 13:44.721
- Tell me.
- He killed Lila.

13:44.755 --> 13:46.956
Why would he do that?

13:46.991 --> 13:48.257
She was gonna choose me over him,

13:48.292 --> 13:49.592
and he's an arrogant son of a bitch.

13:49.626 --> 13:53.463
Not gonna let a Lloyd
humiliate a Grayson that way.

13:53.497 --> 13:54.964
How come your families don't get along?

13:54.999 --> 13:57.400
His great-grandfather falsely accused

13:57.434 --> 14:00.403
my mother's uncle Barry
of stealing a horse.

14:00.437 --> 14:01.404
When was this?

14:01.438 --> 14:02.672
Before the Great War.

14:02.706 --> 14:05.508
- World War One.
- Yeah.

14:05.542 --> 14:07.377
BULLOCK: <i>For three generations,</i>

14:07.411 --> 14:09.579
your families have been feuding
over a stolen horse?

14:09.613 --> 14:11.381
Yes. And the Lloyds are still trash.

14:11.415 --> 14:12.482
Blood is blood.

14:12.516 --> 14:13.983
Must be a hell of a horse.

14:14.018 --> 14:15.618
Why did Mr. Lloyd assault you?

14:15.653 --> 14:18.621
He killed Lila, and fears
I'm gonna kill him for it.

14:18.656 --> 14:20.089
He says the opposite.

14:20.124 --> 14:21.691
He says you killed her.

14:21.725 --> 14:24.927
Yes, I suppose he would
have to say that, wouldn't he?

14:24.962 --> 14:26.262
It wasn't uncle Owen.

14:26.297 --> 14:28.064
He could never do such a terrible thing.

14:28.098 --> 14:29.065
Holy crap, Mary!

14:29.099 --> 14:30.600
How can you be so blind?

14:30.634 --> 14:32.201
Quiet, you.

14:32.236 --> 14:33.336
Yeah, quiet, you.

14:33.370 --> 14:34.437
You're the blind one.

14:34.471 --> 14:35.471
My brother is a man of honor.

14:35.506 --> 14:37.173
Your uncle is a violent drunk.

14:37.207 --> 14:39.375
- Do the math, little girl.
- My uncle is an artist.

14:39.410 --> 14:42.211
Your brother is a conceited
muscle-head, like the rest

14:42.246 --> 14:43.346
of you flying douche bags.

14:43.380 --> 14:45.615
I can't believe I ever thought I loved you.

14:45.649 --> 14:47.350
Enough. Huh?

14:57.061 --> 14:58.895
(door opens)

14:58.929 --> 15:00.096
They're coming.

15:00.130 --> 15:01.364
Are you ready?

15:01.398 --> 15:02.932
CROWD: Yes!

15:02.967 --> 15:04.901
I said, are you ready?!

15:04.935 --> 15:06.703
CROWD: Yes!

15:10.407 --> 15:13.076
Inmate 57A, raise your hand.

15:14.645 --> 15:16.646
57A...

15:16.680 --> 15:18.648
Raise your hand.

15:23.020 --> 15:24.687
Step forward.

15:29.426 --> 15:31.661
One moment, please, sir.

15:33.164 --> 15:36.232
We need to talk.

15:44.510 --> 15:46.444
Back up, inmate.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.113
You're in violation.

15:48.147 --> 15:50.182
57A, step forward!

15:50.246 --> 15:52.213
Excuse me one moment, please.

15:52.248 --> 15:54.215
I'm the new "shot caller" here.

15:54.946 --> 15:56.513
My name is Fish Mooney,

15:56.547 --> 15:59.516
and with all due respect, for you and I

15:59.550 --> 16:01.885
to have a good working relationship,

16:01.920 --> 16:03.987
there's some things that need to change.

16:04.022 --> 16:05.255
Is that right?

16:05.290 --> 16:06.490
What's your name?

16:06.524 --> 16:08.959
None of your damn business what my name is.

16:08.993 --> 16:11.462
Right. Okay, well...

16:11.496 --> 16:13.363
I know you have a job to do.

16:13.398 --> 16:16.266
And I am more than willing to give you 57A,

16:16.301 --> 16:18.268
in exchange for

16:18.303 --> 16:22.239
60 crates of water, 30 blankets,
50 pounds of fresh fruit,

16:22.273 --> 16:24.174
and a few magazines.

16:24.209 --> 16:27.578
What if I refuse?

16:27.612 --> 16:29.613
What will you do?

16:29.648 --> 16:33.551
Well, I'd be willing to give you 57A,

16:33.585 --> 16:35.085
just not alive.

16:36.121 --> 16:39.924
- We need them alive.
- Exactly.

16:39.958 --> 16:42.560
I'm gonna count to three.

16:42.594 --> 16:44.929
You'll disappear

16:44.963 --> 16:46.697
or get a severe beating.

16:46.732 --> 16:48.899
I'm gonna take that as a no.

16:48.934 --> 16:50.868
One...

16:50.902 --> 16:52.637
two...

17:03.949 --> 17:05.516
(grunting)

17:15.493 --> 17:17.494
(men panting)

17:24.936 --> 17:28.106
It's simple economics.

17:28.140 --> 17:30.141
Our lives are worth something.

17:32.378 --> 17:36.648
60 crates of water, 30 blankets...

17:36.682 --> 17:38.483
You...

17:38.517 --> 17:39.985
you're coming with me.

17:40.019 --> 17:43.154
The manager is gonna be
very unhappy with you.

17:43.189 --> 17:45.056
(chuckles)

17:50.630 --> 17:52.464
I would think this manager

17:52.498 --> 17:54.866
wouldn't be too happy with you either.

17:54.901 --> 17:57.402
So if he wants to talk to me,

17:57.437 --> 17:59.871
I'll be right here.

17:59.906 --> 18:01.440
Manager doesn't come down here.

18:01.474 --> 18:05.878
Well, looks like we have a standoff.

18:05.912 --> 18:08.947
I'll tell you what.

18:08.982 --> 18:10.582
I can be flexible.

18:10.617 --> 18:13.585
So I'll go talk to this manager,

18:13.620 --> 18:16.221
but while I'm gone,
you're going to stay right here,

18:16.256 --> 18:18.090
as our guest.

18:18.124 --> 18:19.458
How's that sound?

18:23.396 --> 18:25.397
We'll be back.

18:35.008 --> 18:36.208
MAN: Yeah!

18:36.243 --> 18:38.177
(crowd cheering)

19:10.111 --> 19:12.245
Wait, back up a little.

19:12.279 --> 19:14.614
So you set the snake loose?

19:14.649 --> 19:16.249
- Yes, ma'am.
- To track down the body?

19:16.283 --> 19:17.884
Yes, ma'am.

19:17.919 --> 19:19.553
Snakes have an excellent sense of smell.

19:19.587 --> 19:21.087
Well, now I know.

19:21.122 --> 19:23.089
And your prime suspects

19:23.124 --> 19:25.225
are a clown and an acrobat?

19:25.259 --> 19:27.127
Yeah.

19:27.161 --> 19:29.096
Ain't this one a doozy?

19:29.130 --> 19:30.897
Your victim, Lila Valeska,

19:30.932 --> 19:33.033
was killed by a large knife or hatchet.

19:33.067 --> 19:35.168
Multiple blows to the head and upper torso.

19:35.203 --> 19:37.404
Around 3:00 yesterday afternoon.

19:37.438 --> 19:39.640
From 2:30 to 4:15, both Grayson and Lloyd

19:39.674 --> 19:41.308
were in the ring for the matinee.

19:41.342 --> 19:42.976
Well, how precise is that time of death?

19:43.011 --> 19:45.012
Give or take 45 minutes.

19:45.046 --> 19:47.915
Still possible then, but cutting it close.

19:47.949 --> 19:49.550
Hold and press your guys,

19:49.584 --> 19:51.151
but keep looking.

19:51.383 --> 19:52.920
Yeah, boss. Forensics is
working the crime scene now.

19:52.954 --> 19:55.723
We're going through her phone records.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.528
All right!

20:00.562 --> 20:03.030
We're gonna send the rest of you home now,

20:03.065 --> 20:05.633
but the investigation is ongoing.

20:05.667 --> 20:07.301
Nobody leaves town.

20:07.336 --> 20:09.070
And listen up.

20:09.104 --> 20:10.504
No more fighting!

20:10.539 --> 20:12.340
Look where your friends are.

20:15.377 --> 20:17.745
What good is this feud doing you?

20:26.221 --> 20:28.223
I like it when you act all tough.

20:30.226 --> 20:32.227
"Nobody leave town."

20:32.261 --> 20:34.095
Sounds better when you say it.

20:34.130 --> 20:35.463
(laughs)

20:35.498 --> 20:37.132
I feel like we should

20:37.166 --> 20:39.067
finish up our date.

20:39.101 --> 20:40.669
Do you want to come over tonight?

20:40.703 --> 20:42.103
I can cook you dinner.

20:42.138 --> 20:44.172
Sure. That sounds good.

20:44.207 --> 20:45.974
Good.

20:46.008 --> 20:47.108
Get some rest.

20:47.143 --> 20:49.044
I will try. See you later.

20:52.148 --> 20:54.249
I have to ask.

20:54.284 --> 20:56.952
If you were to guess, who
do you think killed Lila?

20:56.986 --> 20:58.353
I try not to guess.

20:58.388 --> 21:00.589
I work the suspects
and I wait on forensics.

21:00.623 --> 21:02.724
Excuse me.

21:04.728 --> 21:08.130
Am I speaking to Detective James Gordon?

21:08.164 --> 21:10.699
Yes.

21:10.734 --> 21:15.471
Then this must be Dr. Thompkins,
the medical examiner.

21:15.505 --> 21:18.240
I'm sorry, how did you know who we were?

21:18.275 --> 21:20.142
My name is Paul Cicero.

21:20.177 --> 21:23.379
I'm a psychic with the sideshow.

21:23.413 --> 21:26.249
Lila Valeska was an old friend of mine.

21:26.283 --> 21:28.251
A psychic. I see.

21:28.285 --> 21:30.186
How could I help you, Mr. Cicero?

21:30.220 --> 21:35.191
I sense that you don't think
Owen or Alphonse are guilty.

21:35.225 --> 21:36.426
You must be psychic.

21:36.460 --> 21:37.994
In which case,

21:38.028 --> 21:39.963
perhaps you'd like to hear the message

21:39.997 --> 21:43.032
Lila sent me from the other side.

21:43.067 --> 21:45.268
Thanks, Mr. Cicero,
we're not quite looking at

21:45.302 --> 21:47.003
the other side just yet.

21:47.037 --> 21:49.572
As you wish. I'm merely a messenger.

21:49.607 --> 21:51.942
What's the message?

21:51.976 --> 21:54.244
Thank you, Doctor.

21:56.080 --> 21:57.314
Lila told me

21:57.348 --> 21:59.116
that the servant

21:59.150 --> 22:00.617
of the Devil

22:00.651 --> 22:04.287
lies in the garden of the Iron Sisters.

22:04.322 --> 22:06.256
The Iron Sisters?

22:06.291 --> 22:07.457
What does that mean?

22:07.492 --> 22:08.926
I don't know.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.027
We'll get right on it.

22:10.061 --> 22:13.130
I don't think sarcasm
is your métier, James.

22:13.164 --> 22:15.065
Make of the message what you will.

22:15.100 --> 22:16.333
Good day to you both.

22:16.368 --> 22:18.602
(whistles a short tune)

22:24.609 --> 22:27.011
Well, that wasn't very open-minded of you.

22:27.045 --> 22:29.346
Oh, come on, Lee. He's a fraud.

22:29.381 --> 22:30.715
He's gonna go straight to the press

22:30.749 --> 22:32.550
and say he's consulting on the case.

22:32.584 --> 22:33.951
He's looking for publicity.

22:33.986 --> 22:35.286
Maybe.

22:36.588 --> 22:38.122
If you were gonna send a message

22:38.157 --> 22:39.490
from beyond the grave,

22:39.525 --> 22:41.192
don't you think priority number one

22:41.226 --> 22:43.161
would be the killer's name
and not a riddle?

22:43.195 --> 22:44.595
Who knows how it works?

22:46.265 --> 22:47.632
All right. I'm not gonna argue with you.

22:47.666 --> 22:49.400
Good.

22:49.435 --> 22:51.069
Later, then.

22:52.605 --> 22:54.005
Later.

23:02.014 --> 23:04.382
(footsteps approaching)

23:04.417 --> 23:06.618
They called to confirm

23:06.652 --> 23:10.155
your meeting with the board
of Wayne Enterprises tomorrow.

23:10.189 --> 23:12.424
Excellent.

23:12.458 --> 23:14.326
I was afraid they'd postpone again.

23:14.360 --> 23:15.527
Well, I'll say it one more time.

23:15.562 --> 23:17.196
I think that, uh,

23:17.230 --> 23:20.065
it's an incredibly bad idea, Master Bruce.

23:20.100 --> 23:23.302
I think it's reckless,
I think it's premature,

23:23.336 --> 23:25.104
and, quite frankly,
I think it's bloody dangerous.

23:25.138 --> 23:27.206
And we've already been over this
hundred times, Alfred.

23:28.675 --> 23:30.176
My mind is made up.

23:32.045 --> 23:34.313
Can you pass me that file over there?

23:34.348 --> 23:37.183
The file...

Well...

23:39.019 --> 23:41.187

Mmm. I remember, as a kid,

25:41.828 --> 25:43.128
we used to call them that, but...

25:43.162 --> 25:45.931
Right. And there's a park,
um, under the towers

25:45.965 --> 25:47.799
on the Gotham side.

25:47.834 --> 25:49.968
A garden? It all fits.

25:50.003 --> 25:51.470
Lee...

25:51.504 --> 25:53.138
it fits an impossible story.

25:53.173 --> 25:54.540
He didn't speak with Lila Valeska;

25:54.574 --> 25:56.642
- she's dead.
- So you say!

25:56.676 --> 25:58.544
Come on, you're a doctor. A scientist.

25:58.578 --> 25:59.945
There are plenty of things in this world

25:59.980 --> 26:01.413
that can't be explained
by rational science.

26:01.448 --> 26:02.615
Yeah, people who enjoy

26:02.649 --> 26:03.816
folk dancing, for instance.

26:03.850 --> 26:05.384
Doesn't mean ghosts exist.

26:05.419 --> 26:07.053
You're very arrogant in your certainty.

26:07.087 --> 26:10.656
What if this is a clue to a murder?

26:10.691 --> 26:12.125
The poor woman!

26:12.159 --> 26:15.395
(sighs)

26:15.429 --> 26:17.063
Fine. I'll go myself.

26:17.097 --> 26:19.099
- Thank you.
- Sure.

26:19.133 --> 26:20.834
- I'll come with you.
- Okay.

26:20.868 --> 26:22.669
We'll go together.
First thing in the morning.

26:22.703 --> 26:23.803
Morning?

26:25.606 --> 26:27.040
Now?

26:27.074 --> 26:28.475
You want to go now?

26:29.677 --> 26:30.911
It's only a half a mile away.

26:30.945 --> 26:32.579
It's dark.

26:32.614 --> 26:34.081
I have a flashlight.

26:34.115 --> 26:36.016
(fork clatters on plate)

26:36.050 --> 26:37.718
(man coughs)

26:37.752 --> 26:39.953
(cars rattle on bridge)

26:39.988 --> 26:42.523
GORDON: So what are we looking
for, exactly, do you think?

26:42.557 --> 26:43.891
THOMPKINS: I know, I know.

26:43.925 --> 26:45.793
This is probably a complete waste of time.

26:45.827 --> 26:47.962
- Thank you for doing this.
- No problem.

26:47.996 --> 26:51.465
But, uh, let's not make
a habit out of it, okay?

26:51.500 --> 26:52.967
This is no place for a lady.

26:53.001 --> 26:54.836
Ha!

26:54.870 --> 26:56.871
What do you mean, "ha"?

26:56.905 --> 26:58.606
You're a hypocrite.

26:58.641 --> 27:00.508
You say you want a strong woman

27:00.542 --> 27:02.710
to share this crazy life you've chosen,

27:02.745 --> 27:03.945
but when push comes to shove,

27:03.979 --> 27:06.481
you want me to stay home and bake cookies.

27:08.517 --> 27:10.418
Not cookies, necessarily.

27:10.453 --> 27:12.554
Pie. Any kind of pie.

27:12.588 --> 27:14.122
Ha, ha!

27:14.157 --> 27:18.427
So if someone were to throw something

27:18.461 --> 27:19.828
from a car on the bridge,

27:19.863 --> 27:21.096
this is where it would land.

27:21.131 --> 27:22.498
(Gordon sighs)

27:22.532 --> 27:25.000
Yeah, I guess you're right.

27:25.035 --> 27:27.436
(sighs)

27:39.783 --> 27:42.018
Lee...

27:42.052 --> 27:44.387
(gasps quietly)

27:47.725 --> 27:49.959
THOMPKINS: THFC.

27:49.994 --> 27:51.461
What does that mean?

27:51.495 --> 27:53.463
The Hellfire Club.

27:53.497 --> 27:55.765
It's a Satanist cult.

27:55.800 --> 27:59.035
Committed a string of ritual murders.

27:59.070 --> 28:02.072
But they haven't been active
for a decade or more.

28:02.106 --> 28:04.041
I guess they're back.

28:05.843 --> 28:07.578
No.

28:07.612 --> 28:09.780
No, I don't think so.

28:12.670 --> 28:14.204
Hey, Sarge, I'm gonna need

28:14.238 --> 28:16.073
a couple of mobile units
to pick some people up.

28:16.136 --> 28:18.804
But listen... they need careful handling.

28:31.285 --> 28:32.886
Sir, they're in three and four.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.087
Thanks, Zeke. Neither of them knows

28:34.121 --> 28:35.255
the other one's here, right?

28:35.289 --> 28:36.590
Right, like you said.

28:36.624 --> 28:38.058
Ah, good work.

28:38.092 --> 28:40.026
Just bear in mind that you could be wrong

28:40.061 --> 28:41.661
- about all of this.
- I will bear it in mind.

28:41.696 --> 28:42.996
I will, but I'm not wrong.

28:43.031 --> 28:45.098
So go on home now, lady.

28:45.133 --> 28:46.900
Hey.

28:46.935 --> 28:49.269
We were having a perfectly lovely evening.

28:49.304 --> 28:51.238
I am not the one who wanted

28:51.272 --> 28:52.940
to go out searching for Satanist hatchets.

28:52.974 --> 28:55.008
You... know what I wanted to do.

28:55.043 --> 28:57.111
You're right.

28:57.145 --> 28:58.112
Uh-huh. I'm sorry, what?

29:00.715 --> 29:02.950
I tend to get overly enthusiastic

29:02.984 --> 29:04.318
about things. It's an issue for me.

29:04.352 --> 29:05.853
My mom always said...

29:05.887 --> 29:07.822
Oh, who gives a crap
what my mom said, right?

29:07.856 --> 29:09.890
(sighs)

29:09.925 --> 29:11.125
Have a good night, Jim.

29:11.159 --> 29:12.326
Let me know how it all turns out.

29:12.361 --> 29:14.028
Good night, Lee.

29:15.330 --> 29:16.631
Wait!

29:27.910 --> 29:29.744
What you said earlier,

29:29.778 --> 29:31.646
about hypocrisy, sharing lives...

29:33.716 --> 29:36.050
You're right. Let's go.

29:37.219 --> 29:38.620
I'm what?

29:42.224 --> 29:44.059
(whispering): Right.

29:44.093 --> 29:45.927
(clears throat)

29:55.138 --> 29:57.706
Good evening, Mr. Cicero.

29:57.740 --> 29:59.741
Sorry to bring you down here so late.

30:01.044 --> 30:03.812
Good evening, Detective Gordon;

30:03.847 --> 30:05.314
Dr. Thompkins.

30:05.348 --> 30:07.716
How did you...

30:07.751 --> 30:09.918
He smells your perfume.

30:09.953 --> 30:11.620
We solved the message Lila sent you.

30:11.655 --> 30:13.188
Oh?

30:13.223 --> 30:15.624
Took us to Arkham Bridge Park.

30:15.659 --> 30:18.360
We found a hatchet there

30:18.395 --> 30:21.230
with Satanist symbols scratched into it.

30:21.264 --> 30:22.865
Dear lord.

30:22.899 --> 30:24.367
You know what that hatchet
means, Mr. Cicero?

30:24.401 --> 30:25.835
Tell me.

30:25.869 --> 30:27.703
It means you're an accessory to murder.

30:27.738 --> 30:29.072
Such drama.

30:29.136 --> 30:31.571
I merely passed along a message.

30:31.606 --> 30:33.340
GORDON: A message from the dead.

30:33.374 --> 30:34.474
Didn't happen.

30:34.508 --> 30:37.677
Which means you invented the message...

30:37.712 --> 30:40.180
which means you had someone
plant the hatchet

30:40.214 --> 30:42.082
for us to find.

30:42.116 --> 30:43.717
You wanted us to think

30:43.751 --> 30:46.086
Satanist were responsible for Lila's death.

30:46.120 --> 30:47.421
(exhales)

30:47.455 --> 30:49.022
You're protecting somebody.

30:49.057 --> 30:51.024
Lila spoke to me.

30:51.059 --> 30:52.259
That's all.

30:56.164 --> 30:57.164
GORDON: You know,

30:57.198 --> 30:59.400
a hatchet is a clumsy ploy.

30:59.434 --> 31:01.769
You wouldn't try it
unless you were desperate.

31:03.371 --> 31:06.206
Which suggests
you're protecting someone close.

31:06.241 --> 31:09.109
Someone you love.

31:09.144 --> 31:14.682
This fantasia was conjured
in your blinkered mind.

31:14.716 --> 31:17.752
If you could only see what I see...

31:17.786 --> 31:20.087
(door opens)

31:20.122 --> 31:22.056
Hi, Jerome.

31:22.090 --> 31:23.357
Please.

31:23.392 --> 31:24.559
Take a seat.

31:24.593 --> 31:28.362
You know Mr. Cicero, from the show.

31:28.397 --> 31:29.664
Yes, sir.

31:29.698 --> 31:31.666
Hello, Mr. Cicero.

31:31.700 --> 31:33.601
Good evening, Jerome.

31:41.076 --> 31:42.343
Do you know why you're here?

31:42.378 --> 31:44.445
Did you find out who killed my mother?

31:44.480 --> 31:46.147
You killed your mother, Jerome.

31:48.050 --> 31:49.217
Me?

31:49.251 --> 31:51.086
You killed her up on that hill

31:51.120 --> 31:53.154
and Mr. Cicero let you
clean up in his trailer.

31:53.189 --> 31:54.489
He told you to scratch

31:54.523 --> 31:56.024
the Satanist stuff on the hatchet

31:56.058 --> 31:57.225
and throw it off the bridge.

31:57.260 --> 32:00.095
Sir, that's... absurd and...

32:00.129 --> 32:03.398
- and offensive.
- But it's the truth.

32:03.432 --> 32:07.369
What I don't know is why this man
risked so much to help you.

32:07.403 --> 32:09.071
I think he's your father.

32:11.574 --> 32:13.642
JEROME: You don't know
what you're talking about.

32:13.676 --> 32:15.777
My father was a sea captain.

32:16.813 --> 32:18.614
GORDON: Am I wrong,

32:18.648 --> 32:19.681
Mr. Cicero?

32:19.716 --> 32:21.316
Yes.

32:21.351 --> 32:22.651
He was a sea captain.

32:22.685 --> 32:24.520
His name was Sven Karlsen. He died at sea.

32:24.554 --> 32:27.690
What was the name of his ship?

32:27.724 --> 32:30.225
He worked on a lot of different ships.

32:30.260 --> 32:32.428
The one he went down in.

32:35.432 --> 32:36.699
She never said.

32:36.733 --> 32:39.635
We can do a blood test to prove I'm right.

32:39.669 --> 32:42.004
It takes only half an hour
to get a foolproof result.

32:42.038 --> 32:43.472
Isn't that right, Dr. Thompkins?

32:43.507 --> 32:45.408
Yes.

32:45.442 --> 32:47.743
Save yourself a needle.

32:47.778 --> 32:50.179
I do hate needles.

32:51.815 --> 32:54.216
I'm sorry, Jerome.

32:54.251 --> 32:57.053
What are you talking about?

32:57.087 --> 32:59.689
He's right.

32:59.723 --> 33:02.625
I am your father.

33:02.659 --> 33:04.393
No, you're not. Why would you say that?

33:04.428 --> 33:07.063
You must have suspected the truth.

33:07.097 --> 33:08.698
You're not my father.
My mother would never...

33:08.732 --> 33:10.366
Your mother was

33:10.401 --> 33:12.435
a cruel woman; she was often unkind to me,

33:12.469 --> 33:17.774
but she did once love me, in her way.

33:17.808 --> 33:21.144
And she loved you very much.

33:21.178 --> 33:24.247
That's why she gave you a better father.

33:26.751 --> 33:29.319
(crying)

33:33.190 --> 33:35.859
(chuckling)

33:39.697 --> 33:42.065
My mother

33:42.099 --> 33:43.233
was a cold-hearted whore

33:43.267 --> 33:44.768
who never loved anyone.

33:44.802 --> 33:46.503
And she'd never touch

33:46.537 --> 33:50.040
a pathetic old creep like you.

33:50.074 --> 33:52.109
All these years,

33:52.143 --> 33:54.111
do you think I was kind to you

33:54.145 --> 33:55.512
because I'm such a good man?

33:55.546 --> 33:58.382
If I wasn't your father,

33:58.416 --> 34:02.185
would I help you as I have,
after what you did?

34:06.257 --> 34:09.025
My father... Hm.

34:09.060 --> 34:10.627
I'll be damned.

34:13.231 --> 34:15.431
Oh, that's very funny.

34:15.467 --> 34:17.601
(chuckles)

34:17.635 --> 34:19.570
(laughs)

34:19.603 --> 34:22.306
Ba-doom-shh!

34:22.340 --> 34:25.743
Looks like the bitch got me
with a zinger in the end.

34:25.777 --> 34:28.579
Why did you kill your mother, Jerome?

34:28.612 --> 34:31.282
Oh, you know how mothers are.

34:31.315 --> 34:35.219
She just kept pushing.

34:35.253 --> 34:37.054
And I'm like, fine, mom.

34:37.089 --> 34:38.522
Be a whore.

34:38.556 --> 34:41.058
Be a drunken whore, even.

34:41.092 --> 34:45.429
But don't be a nagging drunken whore.

34:45.464 --> 34:47.164
You know?

34:47.199 --> 34:50.601
Don't come yell at me to do the dishes

34:50.636 --> 34:52.469
if you've been banging

34:52.504 --> 34:54.705
a clown in the next room!

34:57.342 --> 34:59.010
You know?

34:59.044 --> 35:01.245
(hysterical laughter)

35:19.265 --> 35:21.266
Long night, huh?

35:22.735 --> 35:25.036
Guess it got kind of ugly.

35:25.070 --> 35:26.471
Yes, it did.

35:26.505 --> 35:29.140
You okay?

35:29.175 --> 35:31.242
I'm good.

35:31.277 --> 35:32.644
(sighs)

35:32.678 --> 35:34.646
Truly.

35:34.680 --> 35:37.716
It was ugly, but it was also
kind of thrilling.

35:37.750 --> 35:39.651
Thrilling?

35:39.685 --> 35:42.487
Thrilling and scary.

35:42.521 --> 35:46.291
Like... Like looking down
a deep, dark tunnel.

35:46.325 --> 35:47.492
(chuckles)

35:52.398 --> 35:54.232
Thanks for letting me be there.

35:56.602 --> 35:59.371
You are an unusual woman.

36:00.540 --> 36:02.707
You just don't know many women.

36:04.677 --> 36:06.678
(laughs)

36:17.690 --> 36:19.691
Can we go home now?

36:21.060 --> 36:22.828
Mm-hmm.

36:51.558 --> 36:53.559
♪ ♪

37:05.570 --> 37:07.504
ZSASZ: Hello, Penguin.

37:10.575 --> 37:12.476
Victor.

37:12.510 --> 37:13.978
How nice.

Don Falcone thinks you're messing up.

You don't know how to run a club.

stink.

37:29.693 --> 37:30.960
With all due respect...

37:30.994 --> 37:33.162
I didn't come here to talk.

Good manners cost nothing, you know?

Hi.

Falcone didn't want to throw him away,

38:12.423 --> 38:14.090
so I worked on him in my basement

38:14.125 --> 38:15.725
for a couple of weeks.

38:15.760 --> 38:17.994
He's a whole new man.

38:18.029 --> 38:19.663
Right, Butch?

38:19.697 --> 38:21.131
Yes, sir, Mr. Zsasz.

38:21.165 --> 38:24.634
Butch knows the club scene up and down.

38:24.669 --> 38:26.403
He'll help you out.

38:27.538 --> 38:29.372
But he's...

38:29.407 --> 38:31.408
He's Butch Gilzean.

38:31.442 --> 38:33.009
He's loyal to Fish Mooney.

38:33.044 --> 38:35.078
And he'll do...

38:35.112 --> 38:37.914
exactly what you say.

38:39.083 --> 38:41.051
Really?

38:41.085 --> 38:42.552
Really.

38:42.586 --> 38:44.621
(chuckles)

38:45.990 --> 38:48.425
Hey, Butch,

38:48.459 --> 38:50.593
dance for me.

38:55.566 --> 38:56.933
I do good work.

39:31.769 --> 39:33.503
Good morning, everyone.

39:33.568 --> 39:34.836
Good morning, Bruce.

39:34.866 --> 39:36.100
Welcome to Wayne Enterprises.

39:36.134 --> 39:37.334
So happy to see you.

39:37.369 --> 39:39.837
Thank you for meeting with me.

39:41.339 --> 39:43.741
I have some questions

39:43.775 --> 39:45.109
regarding Wayne Enterprises
business affairs.

39:45.143 --> 39:46.277
BOARD MEMBER: Of course.

39:46.311 --> 39:47.845
It's your company, after all.

39:47.879 --> 39:49.813
Fire away, young man.

39:49.848 --> 39:52.283
I have two main areas of concern.

39:52.317 --> 39:54.385
Underworld involvement
in the Arkham Project.

39:55.453 --> 39:56.921
And chemical weapons manufacture

39:56.955 --> 39:59.323
at our Wellzyn affiliate.

40:05.030 --> 40:06.397
That's great.

40:06.431 --> 40:07.998
Congratulations.

40:08.033 --> 40:09.366
We wanted to thank you.

40:09.401 --> 40:11.168
If you hadn't figure out who killed Lila

40:11.202 --> 40:13.203
and talked to sense to us the way you did,

40:13.238 --> 40:14.938
our families never would have reconciled,

40:14.973 --> 40:16.740
and we could've never gotten together.

40:16.775 --> 40:19.510
Just doing my job.

40:19.544 --> 40:21.078
Hey, if we have a son,
we'll name him Gordon.

40:21.112 --> 40:23.047
Well...

40:23.081 --> 40:24.381
we'll discuss that,

40:24.416 --> 40:25.449
but we're certainly

40:25.483 --> 40:26.984
very grateful.

40:27.018 --> 40:28.485
Sure.

40:37.228 --> 40:38.762
Why so happy?

40:38.797 --> 40:40.898
Happy customers.

40:40.932 --> 40:41.999
That's not it.

40:42.033 --> 40:43.167
It's something else.

40:44.802 --> 40:46.303
You got laid, didn't you?

40:46.337 --> 40:48.772
- That's impressive.
- You slept somewhere

40:48.806 --> 40:51.475
without razors
and you smell like ladies' soap.

40:51.509 --> 40:53.510
Easy catch.

40:59.317 --> 41:01.084
I can only conclude

41:01.119 --> 41:03.820
that high-level individuals or groups

41:03.855 --> 41:05.889
within Wayne Enterprises have colluded

41:05.923 --> 41:09.092
in corruption, bribery, racketeering,

41:09.127 --> 41:11.361
and unethical medical research.

41:11.396 --> 41:13.463
Thank you for that input, Bruce.

41:13.498 --> 41:15.165
I'm so sorry if you've been alarmed

41:15.199 --> 41:17.734
or upset by these shocking stories

41:17.769 --> 41:19.870
and rumors you've been exposed to.

41:19.904 --> 41:21.905
These are much more than rumors.

41:21.939 --> 41:23.740
We'll look into them thoroughly
and carefully, of course.

41:23.775 --> 41:26.076
Bruce, let's be fair.

41:26.110 --> 41:29.346
You've told us nothing with any
substantive proof behind it.

41:32.717 --> 41:34.284
I haven't told you all I know.

41:34.318 --> 41:36.319
No?

41:36.354 --> 41:37.954
What else is there?

41:37.989 --> 41:40.223
I hope you do look closely
into these issues.

41:40.258 --> 41:42.826
Because I'll be raising them at
the next shareholders' meeting

41:42.860 --> 41:45.161
with a view to possible legal action.

41:45.196 --> 41:47.230
Dear me.

41:47.265 --> 41:49.466
Legal action?

41:49.500 --> 41:51.167
These are all very deep waters

41:51.202 --> 41:52.702
for such a young man.

41:52.737 --> 41:54.704
My youth is not relevant.

41:54.739 --> 41:56.840
Except that if I were a man,

41:56.874 --> 41:59.709
I would be chairing this board.

41:59.744 --> 42:01.945
And I would be sure that Wayne Enterprises

42:01.979 --> 42:03.179
was run honestly.

42:03.214 --> 42:04.981
Thank you for your time.

42:24.468 --> 42:26.836
The manager says you have a deal.

42:26.870 --> 42:29.372
You go up and see him,

42:29.406 --> 42:30.707
I stay here.

42:37.347 --> 42:40.849
- What's your name?
- Schmidt.

42:40.873 --> 42:43.571
Your first name?

42:45.071 --> 42:49.570
- Thomas.
- Thomas. Welcome.

42:51.770 --> 42:56.870
Why don't you take off
that heavy gear and relax?

42:59.570 --> 43:01.670
My family's gonna show you good time.
