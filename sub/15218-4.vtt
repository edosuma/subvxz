<i>It all started when a time travel
experiment I was conducting... </i>

00:05.171 --> 00:08.106
<i>went... a little caca. </i>

00:08.173 --> 00:11.666
<i>In the blink of a cosmic clock,
I went from quantum physicist</i>

00:11.745 --> 00:15.112
<i>to air force test pilot,</i>

00:15.181 --> 00:17.911
<i>which could have been
fun if I knew how to fly. </i>

00:17.984 --> 00:21.249
<i>Fortunately, I had help,
an observer from the project named Al. </i>

00:21.321 --> 00:25.348
<i>Unfortunately, Al's a hologram,
so all he can lend is moral support. </i>

00:25.425 --> 00:28.417
<i>Anyway, here I am,
bouncing around in time,</i>

00:28.495 --> 00:30.588
<i>putting things right
that once went wrong,</i>

00:30.663 --> 00:34.531
<i>a sort of time-traveling Lone Ranger
with Al as my Tonto,</i>

00:34.601 --> 00:37.126
<i>and I don't even need a mask. </i>

00:38.138 --> 00:40.072
Oh, boy.

<i> You know, this leaping about
in time has its advantages. </i>

02:02.122 --> 02:05.990
<i>Like being able to reunite
the love of my life with her father. </i>

02:06.059 --> 02:10.553
<i>And even though I wasn't supposed to
affect anyone in my personal future,</i>

02:10.630 --> 02:12.962
<i>I figured the big guy upstairs
would understand. </i>

02:20.039 --> 02:23.031
<i>Then again, maybe he didn't. </i>

02:23.109 --> 02:26.670
Get up.! Get up,
Kid.! One, two, three...

02:26.746 --> 02:31.581
- Get up! Up!
- four, five, six,

02:31.651 --> 02:35.178
Get up.! Up.!
seven, eight, nine

02:35.255 --> 02:38.918
- That's it. That's it.
- You okay, Kid?

02:38.992 --> 02:40.755
Come on.

02:53.740 --> 02:57.699
Come on. Stop it. Knock it off. Come on. Stop it.

02:57.777 --> 02:59.904
Get back.

03:03.917 --> 03:07.011
Go to a neutral corner. One, two...

03:07.086 --> 03:08.883
Sorry, I...
Go to a neutral corner.

03:08.955 --> 03:11.389
Three, four, five,

03:11.457 --> 03:14.893
six, seven, eight, nine...

03:14.961 --> 03:18.795
You're out. The winner.

03:24.003 --> 03:28.099
<i> How about a statement?
Turn this way, would ya?</i>

03:28.174 --> 03:31.837
Hey, everybody outta here.
Give the Kid some air.

03:31.911 --> 03:35.369
Chalky, get them outta here. You're
fighting Tiger Joe Jackson in a week or two,

03:35.448 --> 03:37.473
Out! Out! Chalky, have a heart come on.

03:40.587 --> 03:44.182
<i>Kid, Kid, we need one statement for
the press. He'll talk to you later. </i>

03:44.257 --> 03:46.623
<i>Now, come on. Give us a break here</i>

03:52.065 --> 03:57.059
What happened?
You almost lost our last fight together, Kid.

04:06.179 --> 04:09.671
Hold still. You know, I hardly
touched him with that punch.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.909
Funny how fast
he went down.

04:15.421 --> 04:19.414
You okay, Kid? You know
where you are and everything?

04:20.560 --> 04:22.892
Why wouldn't I know
where I am?

04:22.962 --> 04:25.954
Well, uh,
he hit you pretty good.

04:26.032 --> 04:29.524
- Too good, if you ask me.
- What do you mean "too good?"

04:33.640 --> 04:35.801
Hit the shower, Kid.

04:40.246 --> 04:45.206
- You're right on time.
- Promptness is a virtue. Congrat...

04:47.787 --> 04:50.779
Congratulations on your victory
this evening, Mr. Cody.

04:50.857 --> 04:55.089
That surprise punch
in the last inning- it was inspired.

04:55.161 --> 04:58.289
"The last inning. "
Real good.

04:58.364 --> 05:00.958
Your owners are
a lot of laughs, Cody.

05:01.034 --> 05:04.299
You sure Duke Ludden
left Cody to you?

05:04.370 --> 05:07.999
It was legally determined that he left
some of his estate to Saint Mary's Church,

05:08.074 --> 05:10.668
including Mr. Cody's contract.

05:10.743 --> 05:16.181
What about my, uh, guys?

05:16.249 --> 05:18.911
You kidding? Them nuns
is poor as church mice.

05:18.985 --> 05:21.476
We'll have that last be
another time. Okay?

05:25.725 --> 05:28.193
Uh...

05:30.096 --> 05:32.428
Um, I suppose things are happening
rather abruptly for you.

05:32.498 --> 05:36.764
Uh, well, I'm getting used to it.

05:43.776 --> 05:47.109
This is the north wall where
the stained glass window will go.

05:54.620 --> 06:00.456
The poor box here. Uh, that section over there
is for feeding and shelter for the homeless.

06:00.526 --> 06:05.054
And, finally, this area here...

06:05.131 --> 06:09.693
The main chapel area, open
to the poor 24 hours a day.

06:09.769 --> 06:13.933
That way, God's available
to anyone at any time.

06:14.006 --> 06:16.668
Oh, it'll be so beautiful.

06:16.743 --> 06:21.646
Just imagine the sun streaming
through the stained glass window...

06:21.714 --> 06:24.410
blues and golds and reds.

06:24.484 --> 06:28.545
And the polished cherry wood of the pews
and the golden tassels on the hymnals.

06:28.621 --> 06:32.455
- Can't you see it?
- But what's this got to do with me?

06:32.525 --> 06:35.358
You're providing it.
After all these years of prayer,

06:35.428 --> 06:37.760
all we need now is for you
to win your next prizefight.

06:37.830 --> 06:42.995
Uh, Sister, um, I'm, uh...
I'm not too good.

06:45.004 --> 06:50.067
Don't be so modest, Cody. You won your
last 10 fights. All by a knockdown.

06:50.143 --> 06:54.546
Just... Just...

06:54.614 --> 06:56.775
don't count on me too much.

06:58.885 --> 07:03.117
I am counting on you. So are all
the other sisters at Saint Mary's.

07:03.189 --> 07:06.681
Cody, you are going to beat
Tiger Joe Jackson...

07:06.759 --> 07:09.319
and become the next
California Heavyweight Champion.

07:09.395 --> 07:11.659
Then we'll have enough money
to start our chapel.

07:11.731 --> 07:15.428
Sister Angela, I would strongly
suggest that you hedge your bet.

07:15.501 --> 07:19.028
Have faith, Cody. It's all going
according to God's plan.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.869
Yeah, but is God going
according to Ziggy's plan?

07:21.941 --> 07:27.106
He figured this leap would land you
in Texas, somewhere in the mid-'50s.

07:27.180 --> 07:30.513
- Oh, great.
- That's the spirit.

07:30.583 --> 07:35.043
Now, um, until you win,
we're going to be scarce on funds,

07:35.121 --> 07:38.190
so, we'd really appreciate it
if you could move in with us

07:38.191 --> 07:40.218
to save us on food and housing expenses.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.693
Sounds better than rent control.

07:44.931 --> 07:47.195
Uh, well...
It's done then.

07:47.266 --> 07:50.201
Why don't you go get your things, and
I'll meet you back at Saint Mary's.

07:50.269 --> 07:52.863
Have faith, Kid Cody.

07:55.074 --> 07:57.324
You know, I have a feeling
that between you and I

07:57.325 --> 08:00.171
and a couple of guardian angels,
we're gonna get this job done.

08:05.251 --> 08:08.914
- Who, who does she remind you of?
- Ingrid Bergman.

08:10.523 --> 08:14.357
No. You.

08:14.427 --> 08:19.421
You and me both back in the old days when we were
trying to raise funding for the imaging chamber.

08:19.499 --> 08:24.493
We were poring over the blueprints
and that was our dream, you know?

08:24.570 --> 08:29.735
Our chapel. Remember? Nah, you don't
- you don't remember.

08:29.809 --> 08:33.210
Oh, this is... Look at this.

08:33.279 --> 08:35.770
"Sacramento, California".
Yuck.

08:35.847 --> 08:40.945
1974. Tell Ziggy that's a long way
from Texas in the '50s.

08:41.020 --> 08:45.286
Well, Ziggy figures it's just
an unscheduled stop.

08:45.358 --> 08:48.589
Well, in case you and Ziggy haven't
noticed, they're all unscheduled stops.

08:48.661 --> 08:52.119
The only thing I'm scheduled to do here
is to get my brains knocked out.

08:52.198 --> 08:55.463
- Don't fight.
- What if that's what I'm supposed to do?

08:55.535 --> 09:01.371
What if I'm here to win the championship
so Sister Angela can get her chapel?

09:01.440 --> 09:05.877
Well, then, uh...
You're in big trouble, Sam.

09:09.615 --> 09:14.109
Al?
Am I boring you, Al?

09:15.621 --> 09:18.886
I just...

09:18.958 --> 09:21.859
I got this nut for a
neighbor who sleeps all day,

09:21.928 --> 09:24.692
and then at night he's rebuilding
the engine on his car.

09:24.764 --> 09:28.090
From 2:00 am, all I hear
is vroom, vroom... vroom.

09:28.091 --> 09:29.634
Okay, that's fine.
Al...

09:29.669 --> 09:34.538
He's got more holes in his
muffler than you've got in your memory.

09:34.607 --> 09:40.068
I complain, uh, this guy...
Oh, yeah, and he's a big guy.

09:40.146 --> 09:44.515
Tells me to blow it out my tailpipe.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

09:54.260 --> 09:57.525
Hey, Kid?
Hey, Kid.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.259
Mr. Edwards wants to see you... now.

10:01.901 --> 10:03.835
Come on.

10:17.316 --> 10:21.810
What the hell were you doing in
that ring today, Kid? Nothing.

10:21.887 --> 10:24.549
That's what it looked like,
nothing.

10:24.624 --> 10:28.116
I won, didn't I?
That's good.

10:28.194 --> 10:31.493
That really is good. I didn't
know you had a sense of humor, Kid.

10:31.564 --> 10:34.488
Well, I, you know, I've been
known to tell a joke or...

10:34.489 --> 10:35.364
Turn it up.

10:35.434 --> 10:37.994
<i>In an attempt to become
the second man in history... </i>

10:38.070 --> 10:42.063
<i>to regain the World
Heavyweight Championship... </i>

10:42.141 --> 10:46.669
<i>The 32-year-old Ali will fight 25-year-old
George Foreman in a 15-round bout with... </i>

10:46.746 --> 10:48.907
I put a couple of bucks
of my own on that one.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.882
Not as much as I'm gonna be
betting on your championship.

10:51.951 --> 10:54.613
I'm-I'm not sure that I'd do that.

10:56.288 --> 10:59.280
What are you trying to
tell me, Kid?

10:59.358 --> 11:02.691
Well, I...

11:02.762 --> 11:05.754
I've been thinking about retiring.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.925
You know, I don't wanna end up...

11:09.001 --> 11:10.935
Like, like...

11:11.003 --> 11:16.805
"Charley, I could been a contender,
instead of a bum. "

11:16.876 --> 11:19.037
Is that...

11:19.111 --> 11:22.740
Quitting right now
would be a bad idea.

11:25.751 --> 11:29.653
Look, come on. You would- You-You'd-You'd
kill a guy 'cause he wants to quit?

11:29.722 --> 11:31.747
No, I don't kill people.
What do you think I am?

11:31.824 --> 11:34.850
We blow off your kneecaps,

11:34.927 --> 11:37.794
give you a little, wooden board with roller
skate wheels for the rest of your life.

11:37.863 --> 11:42.857
You know, I think you're right.

11:42.935 --> 11:46.268
I think... I think quitting
would just probably be a bad idea.

11:46.338 --> 11:48.238
Besides, I never could skate.

11:48.307 --> 11:52.641
What'd you think? I was gonna set you
up for 10 fights, let you retire now?

11:56.916 --> 12:00.079
You're gonna go
in the tank with Tiger Joe.

12:00.152 --> 12:03.315
I'll tell you the round later.
Now get outta here.

12:03.389 --> 12:07.223
Here.
Here's your money.

12:16.836 --> 12:18.770
Hope you know what you're doing.

12:31.283 --> 12:37.119
Great. I'm on the take,
wear polyester clothes...

12:37.189 --> 12:42.684
and live above a bar in
an apartment decorated like a gym.

12:42.762 --> 12:46.220
If I've got a roommate,
he probably has cauliflower ears.

12:46.298 --> 12:49.461
- Hello.
- Hi, honey.

12:52.238 --> 12:56.572
Oh. Honey, I'm sorry
I didn't get to see the fight.

12:56.642 --> 12:58.803
The creep I work for
wouldn't let me off early.

12:58.878 --> 13:02.541
A bunch of soldiers came in, and he
made me dance an extra 45 minutes.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.209
Are you hungry?
I made your favorite for dinner tonight.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.218
My favorite?
Mm-hmm.

13:07.286 --> 13:10.551
Oh, thanks.
I really like my favorite.

13:10.623 --> 13:14.855
It's my...
It's...It's one of my favorites.

13:14.927 --> 13:19.591
I see Mr. Edwards came through. I'm gonna
put it in our secret "hidey-hole," okay?

13:19.665 --> 13:22.828
Okay. Oh.

13:30.442 --> 13:33.070
Soldiers tipped pretty good today.

13:36.248 --> 13:39.479
Looks like we're
ready for that rainy day.

13:39.552 --> 13:44.012
Are you serious? We're gonna need
about $20,000 for that doughnut shop.

13:44.089 --> 13:46.057
You can't go on
fighting forever, Kid.

13:46.125 --> 13:50.789
And I certainly can't go on being a topless
go-go dancer for the rest of my life.

13:50.863 --> 13:52.854
The mountains are starting to
come to Muhammad, you know?

13:52.932 --> 13:55.093
Well, I-I, uh...

13:55.167 --> 13:58.830
You look great to me.
Mmm.

14:02.007 --> 14:04.271
I love you, Cody.

14:04.343 --> 14:08.507
You're the first man who's ever trusted
me with his money and his future.

14:17.122 --> 14:19.784
Oh.

14:21.193 --> 14:23.889
- It's Roscoe.
- Roscoe.

14:23.963 --> 14:26.761
Damn it, Cody.
You promised.

14:26.832 --> 14:30.290
<i>Hey, it's only three "C" notes, Dixie.
It's not so much. </i>

14:30.369 --> 14:33.463
If that nag had come in, I'd be
paying you guys eight grand right now.

14:33.539 --> 14:37.703
Honey, did you try to get it all at once? Well.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.712
Honey, you know the quick way
never works.

14:43.849 --> 14:45.749
<i>Come on, Kid.
You can't welsh on a bet. </i>

14:45.818 --> 14:50.778
He's right. We might as well pay him,
otherwise he'll just wind up beating you up.

14:50.856 --> 14:53.882
I'll get it.

14:59.331 --> 15:01.784
Roscoe,
you come between us and a jelly-filled,

15:01.785 --> 15:04.394
sugar-glazed and sprinkles
on top one more time...

15:04.470 --> 15:07.064
and I'll bust your nose!

15:09.575 --> 15:12.305
<i>Oh.! Damn it.
Oh, you broke my nose. </i>

15:12.378 --> 15:14.938
You want a beer?

15:15.014 --> 15:19.280
Um, I don't have time.

15:19.351 --> 15:22.684
What do you mean
you don't have time?

15:22.755 --> 15:25.883
Well, my contract was inherited-

15:25.958 --> 15:27.789
I know.
By the nuns. So?

15:27.860 --> 15:33.355
Well, they want me to move in to Saint
Mary's and train for the championship.

15:34.867 --> 15:40.362
You know, to save money. You'd rather
go live with the nuns than with me?

15:44.843 --> 15:49.576
I... I don't know what to say, Dixie.
Um, I...

15:52.251 --> 15:57.746
They own me.
Well, honey, I thought I owned you.

16:03.729 --> 16:06.129
And you owned me.

16:06.198 --> 16:11.693
<i>Amazing grace</i>

16:11.770 --> 16:17.367
<i>How sweet the sound</i>

16:17.443 --> 16:23.279
<i>That saved a wretch</i>

16:23.349 --> 16:28.844
<i>Like me</i>

16:28.921 --> 16:34.154
<i>I once was lost</i>

16:34.226 --> 16:40.231
<i>But now I'm found</i>

16:40.699 --> 16:46.736
<i>Was grace that taught</i>

16:47.106 --> 16:51.566
<i>My heart to fear</i>

16:51.643 --> 16:54.840
<i>And grace</i>

16:54.913 --> 17:00.408
<i>My fears relieved</i>

17:02.955 --> 17:08.757
How precious did

17:08.827 --> 17:14.492
That grace appear

17:14.566 --> 17:19.799
The hour I first...

17:19.872 --> 17:25.208
<i>Believed</i>

17:27.445 --> 17:33.351
<i>Through many dangers</i>

17:34.619 --> 17:37.185
Al?

17:37.256 --> 17:42.660
- Al?
- Denise. Denise, get in the closet.

17:45.297 --> 17:49.927
Oh, no, there's
no other girl here, Tina.

17:50.002 --> 17:53.836
I swear, honey.
No, don't, Tina.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.840
Tina?

17:58.410 --> 18:01.902
- Oh, hi, Kid.
- Hi, Al.

18:01.980 --> 18:06.144
You know, people with monogamous relationships
don't wake up with guilty consciences.

18:06.218 --> 18:08.379
I know.
They don't have any fun either.

18:10.022 --> 18:13.355
Anyway, the problem
is not Denise.

18:13.425 --> 18:18.419
The problem is
the muffler from hell.

18:18.497 --> 18:23.935
This guy is driving me nuts with
his vroom, vroom, vroom all night.

18:24.002 --> 18:26.368
Denise? Yeah, she's a writer.

18:26.438 --> 18:29.532
Uh, she's gonna write
my life story.

18:29.608 --> 18:33.772
A writer?
What's she written?

18:33.846 --> 18:37.043
Uh, I don't know.
I met her at a party.

18:37.116 --> 18:40.108
She's got the most incredible
pair of...

18:40.185 --> 18:42.915
Al. Al, you're in a church.

18:42.988 --> 18:46.651
Oh. Of, uh, matching
boxing gloves.

18:48.994 --> 18:53.522
What'd Ziggy come up with? He says there's
not enough data on this guy next door...

18:53.599 --> 18:56.591
to do me a damn bit of good.

18:56.668 --> 18:59.102
Oh, so-sorry. You meant you? Yeah.

18:59.171 --> 19:01.036
Yeah, you.
Mm-hmm.

19:01.106 --> 19:05.907
Well, Ziggy thinks that
given all the unknown variables here,

19:05.978 --> 19:10.711
that your winning the championship and
getting the chapel for the good sisters...

19:10.782 --> 19:14.047
is your best shot at quantum leaping-
What unknown variables?

19:14.119 --> 19:17.577
Well, if we knew the unknown,

19:17.656 --> 19:20.557
the unknown wouldn't be unknown.

19:20.626 --> 19:24.392
Let me give you
a few known variables, Al.

19:24.463 --> 19:26.397
I don't know how to fight.
I'm out of shape.

19:26.465 --> 19:29.832
I've got a nun for a trainer.
Yeah.

19:29.902 --> 19:32.393
I can fix that.
How?

19:32.471 --> 19:35.099
I'll train you myself.
Put 'em up.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.007
No offense, Al, but I need a
real trainer, not a hologram.

19:38.076 --> 19:40.306
What are you talking about?
Put 'em up.

19:40.379 --> 19:45.817
Hey, when I was 16, back in the
days when the dinosaurs ruled the planet,

19:45.884 --> 19:50.378
I was the Golden Gloves
regional champ.

19:50.455 --> 19:53.185
Come on. Put 'em up.
I'll train you myself. Come on.

19:53.258 --> 19:57.251
Who could train you better
than me? Put 'em up. You?

19:57.329 --> 19:58.887
Yeah.
Hit my hand.

20:05.571 --> 20:07.436
Okay.
I'll get you a sparring partner.

20:07.506 --> 20:10.498
- All right?
- It's not gonna work, Al.

20:10.576 --> 20:14.569
What do you mean it's not... Hey, come on.
Give it a chance, for crying out loud.

20:14.646 --> 20:17.479
Where you going?
To get a real trainer.

20:19.818 --> 20:22.480
What do you mean,
"a real trainer"?

20:22.554 --> 20:25.887
Hey, who taught you
everything you know?

20:37.903 --> 20:39.837
I was good too.

21:00.025 --> 21:01.425
Oop!

21:05.796 --> 21:07.465
Here's your T.K.O., Kid.

21:30.622 --> 21:34.683
Next time... next time, uh,
let it breathe a little.

21:41.633 --> 21:43.503
Why won't you train me?

21:43.504 --> 21:47.162
I'm tired of training fighters who take dives.

21:47.239 --> 21:50.868
Well, what if I don't take a dive?
What if this time...

21:50.942 --> 21:55.242
What if this time?
That's the booze talking.

21:55.314 --> 21:59.808
No, it's...
No, it's me talking.

21:59.885 --> 22:03.377
If you come back,
I'll give it everything I got.

22:04.956 --> 22:09.791
That's what I like to see,
a fighter in training.

22:09.861 --> 22:13.353
Hey, bring us another round
for my guys.

22:13.432 --> 22:16.833
Gotta keep 'em sharp
for the championship.

22:16.902 --> 22:20.463
Hey, Kid,
you listen to him.

22:20.539 --> 22:24.532
Yeah, this rumdum
was one of the best.

22:24.609 --> 22:30.104
He could take a swan into the canvas
better than any other fighter I ever owned.

22:30.182 --> 22:35.950
That last fight of yours- ooh-you
should got an Academy Award.

22:40.459 --> 22:42.791
You mean that, Kid? Kid? Huh?

22:42.861 --> 22:46.922
You mean that? I'll give it my best shot.

22:48.533 --> 22:51.024
You got yourself a trainer.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.071
A pro shouldn't spar
with an amateur.

22:59.144 --> 23:01.612
Oh, Father Muldooney will love it.
He'll be talking about it for years.

23:03.815 --> 23:07.945
Can you give me some instructions?
Yeah, don't trip on his beard.

23:08.019 --> 23:10.681
Hi, honey!

23:17.229 --> 23:20.460
Is it okay if I watch?

23:20.532 --> 23:23.933
Uh, Dixie,
this is Sister Angela.

23:24.002 --> 23:26.436
Sister Angela,
this is my Dixie.

23:26.505 --> 23:28.405
How do you do?
Hi. Oh.

23:28.473 --> 23:32.102
Cody, I think you have enough people
in your corner, huh? Are you ready?

23:32.177 --> 23:34.941
Here you go.
Come on. There you go.

23:35.013 --> 23:36.179
Okay.

23:38.850 --> 23:39.942
Hit to the right.

23:43.722 --> 23:46.490
I'm really excited to be
working with you, Mr. Gomez.

23:46.491 --> 23:48.591
I've never done anything like this before.

23:51.496 --> 23:53.123
Attaboy, left, left.

23:54.833 --> 23:58.098
Get him!
Did you change the Kid's style?

24:00.105 --> 24:01.697
Huh?
No. No.

24:03.842 --> 24:06.640
In the breadbasket.
Right in the belly.

24:06.711 --> 24:10.374
- Watch out.
- Come on, honey. Kill the bum.

24:10.449 --> 24:13.384
Hit 'im! Hit 'im!

24:13.452 --> 24:16.512
Kill the bum!

24:23.428 --> 24:25.396
Honey, are you okay?
Are you all right?

24:25.464 --> 24:27.295
- Is he dead? Say something.
- Honey?

24:27.365 --> 24:30.129
Okay, watch out.
Everybody out of the way.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.901
Get 'im up.

24:38.343 --> 24:41.471
Is he all right?
Oh, I'm sorry, Kid.

24:41.546 --> 24:44.379
I guess I just got in a lucky
punch. Give us some room.

24:50.822 --> 24:55.156
- I know what's going on here, Kid.
- You do?

24:55.227 --> 24:58.390
You haven't had
a straight fight in a year.

24:58.463 --> 25:02.832
You're out of shape,
out of wind and out of luck.

25:02.901 --> 25:07.304
You don't need a trainer.
You need a miracle.

26:12.103 --> 26:14.936
Let's pick it up for another mile. Pick it up?

26:15.006 --> 26:17.600
Gomez made me swear that I would
push you hard. Now, come on. Let's go.

26:17.676 --> 26:20.509
Give me a break, Sister.
Just five minutes.

26:20.579 --> 26:24.310
How did you ever get to be a prize
fighter? Just kind of fell into it.

26:24.382 --> 26:27.840
All right. Five minutes.

26:27.919 --> 26:30.911
But we're gonna walk fast.

26:30.989 --> 26:35.824
Deal. We're not gonna lose our chapel
because you were lax on your roadwork.

26:35.894 --> 26:39.557
Why's this chapel so important to you?

26:39.631 --> 26:41.622
That should be obvious
by now, Cody.

26:43.501 --> 26:46.834
Well, it seems to me
there's more to it than that.

26:50.342 --> 26:53.175
It's a long story.
I got five minutes.

26:54.980 --> 26:57.175
You have four minutes
and 32 seconds.

26:57.248 --> 27:02.185
I got four minutes and 32 seconds,
31, 30, 29...

27:02.253 --> 27:04.187
All right. All right.

27:08.026 --> 27:10.017
Well?

27:13.865 --> 27:18.495
When I was a child, I, um...
I lived in a castle.

27:18.570 --> 27:21.232
What?
A pretend castle.

27:21.306 --> 27:24.469
It was actually
a tree house in the backyard.

27:27.145 --> 27:30.478
My mother and my brother used to call
me a princess. I really felt like one.

27:30.548 --> 27:34.177
And one night I went to sleep
dreaming all these sweet dreams,

27:34.252 --> 27:37.915
and I woke up
coughing into the face of a fireman.

27:39.991 --> 27:42.983
My mother and...

27:43.061 --> 27:46.053
and my father
and both my little brothers were killed.

27:49.300 --> 27:53.134
For some unknown reason,
I was spared.

27:55.273 --> 27:58.765
So I was shuffled around for a while
from uncle to uncle and...

28:00.545 --> 28:02.570
it seemed I was a princess
without a castle.

28:04.916 --> 28:06.907
Um, some really bad things happened,

28:06.985 --> 28:11.445
and I ended up out on the street
doing whatever I could to survive.

28:14.125 --> 28:18.755
I began to hate everybody.
Even myself- even God.

28:21.266 --> 28:26.033
And then one night, I... I kind of stumbled
into this skid row chapel in San Francisco.

28:26.104 --> 28:29.096
I was looking for a place to sleep,
and a nun found me and she took me in.

28:29.174 --> 28:31.665
And she... Well, maybe
she didn't save my life,

28:31.743 --> 28:33.734
but she absolutely
saved my soul.

28:33.812 --> 28:37.475
She gave me new hope
and self-respect.

28:39.651 --> 28:43.644
She even gave me
faith in God again.

28:43.722 --> 28:47.214
And I decided at that moment
that I would create a chapel someday...

28:47.292 --> 28:52.286
in the most destitute part of the city
to help people like myself.

28:52.363 --> 28:54.957
To make a memorial for my family.

28:55.033 --> 28:56.898
Another castle.

29:03.441 --> 29:05.932
Our time's up.

29:06.010 --> 29:09.002
Come on.
Let's get back to work.

29:09.080 --> 29:12.243
Pick up those bricks.
Okay.

29:14.252 --> 29:18.780
She's trying to kill me.
Five more miles?

29:18.857 --> 29:22.850
Lift up your knees.
What about mercy?

29:56.060 --> 29:57.994
That's not bad, Kid.
Al.

29:58.062 --> 30:02.294
- What?
- Uh, I'm done.

30:02.367 --> 30:05.393
Work on your timing.
I'll be with you in a minute.

30:05.470 --> 30:07.404
Okay.
Come on.

30:11.476 --> 30:14.411
Al, it's good to see you.
Where you been?

30:14.479 --> 30:17.642
Mm... catching up
on my sleep.

30:19.484 --> 30:22.078
Looking pretty good, Sam.
You're trim, moving well.

30:22.153 --> 30:25.748
Gomez is doing a good job.
Yeah, they both are.

30:25.824 --> 30:29.021
Oh, um, Ziggy finally
came up with some data for you.

30:29.093 --> 30:32.551
The fight. Did Cody win
the fight? He took a dive.

30:32.630 --> 30:34.598
Are you sure?

30:34.666 --> 30:40.366
Yes. October- when was it-
29, 1974.

30:40.438 --> 30:45.239
"Kid Cody is knocked out by Tiger Joe Jackson
in one minute, 10 seconds of the first round. "

30:45.310 --> 30:49.144
What about Sister Angela's chapel?
No. No chapel.

30:49.214 --> 30:54.015
"Today that vacant lot has got a,
uh, mini-mall with a tanning salon,

30:54.085 --> 30:59.079
"a convenience store that's been
robbed five times already this year.

30:59.157 --> 31:02.888
A singles...only gym"...
She never got her castle.

31:02.961 --> 31:06.124
No.
Wait a minute though.

31:06.197 --> 31:10.190
All you're giving me is what happened then.
I'm here to change all that.

31:10.268 --> 31:13.294
How? You gonna beat Tiger Joe
for the championship?

31:13.371 --> 31:16.033
- Why not?
- I'll tell you why not.

31:16.107 --> 31:19.599
You're holding your left too low, that's
why not. Get your left up and pop! Pop, pop!

31:19.677 --> 31:24.046
Get on the balls of your feet. That's it.
Can't punch anybody flat-footed.

31:24.115 --> 31:27.881
Th-That's what Gomez keeps telling me.

31:27.952 --> 31:31.945
Well...
Uh, anything else you wanna know?

31:32.023 --> 31:36.926
- You gonna make it to the fight?
- Uh,yeah.

31:36.995 --> 31:39.088
Yeah, probably.

31:39.163 --> 31:43.827
It, you know... It depends on whether
I can do something to stop the...

31:43.902 --> 31:47.167
The vroom-vrooming. You know,
Al, I've been thinking about that.

31:47.238 --> 31:52.073
What if you taped it at night and then played
it back the next morning while he's sleeping?

31:55.079 --> 31:57.013
That's a good idea.

31:57.081 --> 31:59.572
Yeah.
Thanks, Sam.

32:00.885 --> 32:03.615
Okay, Kid, let's go.

32:10.194 --> 32:12.685
Come on. Jab.

32:16.768 --> 32:19.314
<i>Richard Nixon, although
pardoned, has become</i>

32:19.315 --> 32:21.762
<i> the central figure in the
Watergate cover-up trial. </i>

32:21.839 --> 32:24.389
<i>Being accused by both
prosecution and defense attorneys</i>

32:24.390 --> 32:25.775
Hey, where's your T.K.O.?

32:25.843 --> 32:30.678
I'm in training. One beer a
night. Yeah. That's what I heard.

32:30.748 --> 32:34.411
Link here says you're training hard
- like for real.

32:36.354 --> 32:39.016
You aren't getting in
the habit, are you, Kid?

32:41.592 --> 32:45.619
Those are lethal weapons.
You hit me. I can have you arrested.

32:45.697 --> 32:47.688
No more jokes.

32:49.667 --> 32:54.229
I'd rather see a fighter
turn rumdum than to get religion.

32:54.305 --> 32:56.569
Ooh, hey, look.

32:59.544 --> 33:01.637
It's a streaker.

33:01.713 --> 33:07.117
Oh, I got a couple of dames
I'd like to see doing that.

33:07.185 --> 33:09.710
Ah, now that's what it's all about.

33:12.757 --> 33:17.490
A couple of guys ducking it out.
May the better man win.

33:20.498 --> 33:25.162
You're gonna take your dive
in the first round.

33:25.236 --> 33:27.431
Can't do that, Mr. Edwards.

33:34.946 --> 33:39.940
You got cauliflower in your ears?
I gotta win the championship.

33:40.018 --> 33:43.510
You ain't got a prayer.
Then bet against me.

33:43.588 --> 33:47.888
For even money? Ha!
I get 20-to-1 betting a round.

33:47.959 --> 33:49.927
And the round is numero uno.

33:49.994 --> 33:54.829
What if, um
- What if I tell you what round to bet?

33:56.100 --> 34:01.629
On you?
No. No, I'm not that stupid.

34:06.144 --> 34:10.808
This is crazy. We can get
20-to-1 betting the round.

34:10.882 --> 34:13.543
Honey, this is our life savings.

34:15.386 --> 34:18.878
God's on our side.
We can't lose.

34:18.956 --> 34:23.620
Of course, we have to share
the winnings with the church.

34:23.694 --> 34:27.289
You mean Sister Angela.
For the chapel.

34:27.364 --> 34:32.359
Well, I don't see you asking her to
streak. I couldn't ask a nun to streak.

34:32.437 --> 34:35.429
No. Just a tramp like me.

34:37.275 --> 34:39.937
Dixie,

34:40.011 --> 34:42.844
you're not a tramp.

34:42.914 --> 34:45.074
You're a stripper.
That's a profession.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.851
So's hooking.

34:49.987 --> 34:53.320
Don't do this.

34:53.391 --> 34:56.882
Your streaking's the only chance
I have to knock Tiger Joe Jackson out.

34:56.960 --> 35:02.627
I need you, Dixie,
to win.

35:07.638 --> 35:10.471
And after that,
it'll be nothing but...

35:10.541 --> 35:14.910
jelly-filled, sugar-glazed, and, um-

35:16.881 --> 35:20.715
Sprinkles on top.
Yeah.

35:23.721 --> 35:25.655
Sprinkles on top.

35:32.597 --> 35:34.531
Cody?

35:37.535 --> 35:39.526
Sister Angela.

35:54.185 --> 35:57.518
What's wrong?

35:57.588 --> 36:00.489
A Mr. Edwards
was here to see you.

36:00.558 --> 36:02.992
Edwards.

36:03.060 --> 36:06.552
He couldn't stay, but he
wanted me to give you a message.

36:07.598 --> 36:09.930
He said that...

36:10.001 --> 36:13.493
I wanna make sure
I get this exactly right.

36:13.571 --> 36:16.062
He said that he's thought it over,

36:16.140 --> 36:19.940
and he's decided that he wants to
call the rounds, not you.

36:23.447 --> 36:26.109
You're supposed to
take a dive in the first.

36:29.620 --> 36:32.612
And he left this for you.

36:32.690 --> 36:36.023
There's a thousand dollars in there.

36:36.093 --> 36:39.256
I hope you don't think
too badly of me for looking.

36:42.600 --> 36:45.068
Sister Angela.

36:52.577 --> 36:57.412
I thought that God
sent me a champion.

37:01.085 --> 37:03.747
But he sent me a cheat.

37:07.725 --> 37:11.388
I don't expect you to believe
anything I say, but I've gotta say it.

37:14.398 --> 37:18.835
I'm not the Kid Cody whose fights
were fixed for the last year.

37:18.903 --> 37:22.339
And more important,
I'm not the same Kid Cody...

37:22.406 --> 37:25.170
who is gonna
take a dive in the first round.

37:27.044 --> 37:30.912
You're telling me you're going
to win tomorrow? I'm damn well...

37:30.982 --> 37:34.645
'Scuse me. I'm gonna try.

37:39.323 --> 37:42.156
I would like to believe you, Cody.

37:44.362 --> 37:46.296
But I can't.

37:48.599 --> 37:51.432
I just don't think I can
believe in anything anymore.

37:54.605 --> 37:57.267
Then I don't have
a prayer of winning.

37:57.341 --> 38:01.903
What do you mean?

38:01.979 --> 38:04.072
As long as you believed in me...

38:04.148 --> 38:08.517
that I could win... I believed it.

38:08.586 --> 38:12.579
I mean, maybe that's all winning is,
having the right person believe in you.

38:18.095 --> 38:20.427
Don't give up on me, Sister.

38:25.269 --> 38:28.102
Not if you want that castle.

38:34.912 --> 38:38.245
This is the main event of the evening.
Twelve rounds for...

38:38.316 --> 38:41.183
the Heavyweight Championship
of the State of California.

38:41.252 --> 38:43.584
The challenger in
the blue corner to my left,

38:43.654 --> 38:48.648
wearing white trunks with gold stripes,
from Sacramento, California,

38:48.726 --> 38:53.220
at 185, Clarence "Kid" Cody.

38:55.433 --> 38:58.732
In the red corner,
wearing gold trunks,

38:58.803 --> 39:02.739
from Hawthorne, California, at 207,

39:02.807 --> 39:08.677
the Heavyweight Champion of the State
of California, Tiger Joe Jackson.

39:13.184 --> 39:15.550
Now you both received your
instructions in the dressing room.

39:15.619 --> 39:19.111
Are there any questions?
Uh, no.

39:19.190 --> 39:23.684
- Touch gloves and may the best man win.
- Get ready to take a nap, boy.

39:30.468 --> 39:32.902
Who are you looking for, Kid?
Just a friend.

39:32.970 --> 39:37.964
Guess he couldn't make it.
Wishing' you didn't? Go on, Kid.

39:49.620 --> 39:52.054
Go get 'im, Cody!

40:06.137 --> 40:11.473
- Cody, get up!
- Two, three,

40:11.542 --> 40:17.276
four, five, six,

40:17.348 --> 40:20.408
- seven...
- That's it.

40:21.919 --> 40:24.649
- Come on, Cody!
- Okay. Where you at?

40:24.722 --> 40:27.282
Saskatchewan.
Huh?

40:27.358 --> 40:29.292
Sacramento.

40:32.596 --> 40:36.498
- Come on, Cody. That's it!
- That's the way, sweetie. Get 'im!

40:40.371 --> 40:42.839
Come on, Cody!

40:53.951 --> 40:55.816
Oh, no.

40:58.556 --> 40:59.818
Now?

41:06.197 --> 41:08.222
Look, it's a streaker.!

41:22.146 --> 41:25.582
Helluva fight, Sam.
Right on the button.

41:25.649 --> 41:30.985
Al, I didn't think you'd show. Are you
kidding? I would never miss a fight.

41:31.055 --> 41:35.719
- Five, six.
- Uh-oh, I think you made him angry.

41:35.793 --> 41:38.387
Course I made him angry.
I knocked him out...

41:41.799 --> 41:46.600
Come on, now. Stay on the balls of your feet.
Keep your guard up and pop him with the left.

41:46.670 --> 41:49.730
Come on. Let's go. Pop, pop, pop
with the left. Pop 'im! Pop 'im!

41:51.909 --> 41:55.436
Pop, pop 'im again!

42:00.284 --> 42:03.276
Downstairs! Bring his guard down!
Get 'im in the gut!

42:06.056 --> 42:08.684
Ain't this a kick in the butt.

42:11.929 --> 42:13.521
Where'd that come from?
God knows.

42:13.597 --> 42:19.035
Keep it going. Hit my hand, Sam! Hit my hand!

42:19.103 --> 42:22.595
Hit it! Hit it! Hit it!

42:58.075 --> 43:02.239
Here come the jelly-filled, sugar-glazed
and sprinkles on top!

43:03.581 --> 43:07.415
We won. Yes. In the eighth
round just like you predicted.

43:07.484 --> 43:10.385
What are you talking about?
Muhammad Ali.

43:10.454 --> 43:14.618
We bet everything we had that he'd knock
out Foreman in the eighth round in Zaire,

43:14.692 --> 43:17.024
and he just did it a couple of
seconds ago. That's the round...

43:17.094 --> 43:19.028
you told Edwards to bet on.
Uh-huh.

43:19.096 --> 43:22.429
Only I didn't believe him.
How'd you know, Kid?

43:27.271 --> 43:32.436
Well, uh, when you're fighting
for the Lord, you get inside tips.

43:34.545 --> 43:38.037
It was fixed. It was fixed
and somehow you got wind of it.

43:38.115 --> 43:41.949
It wasn't fixed. Then how
else would you have known?

43:42.953 --> 43:46.684
Say I got a hunch
and had faith.

43:46.757 --> 43:49.123
Mm. I did too.

43:49.193 --> 43:52.959
You and me had a deal. You were
gonna go down in the first round.

43:54.965 --> 43:56.899
Dixie.

44:00.070 --> 44:02.004
Roscoe.

44:03.807 --> 44:06.367
I got your money.
It's just not here.

44:06.443 --> 44:08.096
We bet all of our savings and...

44:08.097 --> 44:11.972
the thousand dollars you gave me
to take a dive on Ali in the eighth.

44:12.049 --> 44:16.782
Roscoe here, he owes us
a grand total of...

44:16.854 --> 44:19.550
Forty-eight thousand dollars.

44:19.623 --> 44:24.993
Twenty for us, 20 for Sister Angela's
chapel and eight for you, Jake.

44:25.062 --> 44:27.587
If that's not enough,
I guess you're gonna have to kill me.

44:27.665 --> 44:29.599
No.

44:35.839 --> 44:37.830
Roscoe?
Yeah?

44:37.908 --> 44:41.207
Looks to me like you owe
I and my partners here some money.

44:41.278 --> 44:44.372
Yeah, well, okay. You take
a check? Shut your face.

44:44.448 --> 44:47.611
Oh, look, forget about it. I'm just
kidding. I was telling a joke there.

44:50.754 --> 44:52.722
Hey, I'm gonna go get the money. Dixie.

44:52.790 --> 44:56.282
- Yeah?
- Hurry back.

44:58.429 --> 45:00.363
Okay.

45:12.042 --> 45:15.034
Looks like
you're gonna get your chapel.

45:15.112 --> 45:18.206
And, there's gonna be
a little extra.

45:18.282 --> 45:21.445
I, um, I took the liberty of...

45:21.518 --> 45:23.543
betting a little money,
and, well...

45:23.620 --> 45:26.384
I am so ashamed for doubting you.

45:26.457 --> 45:29.824
Well, that's all right, Sister.
You didn't doubt God.

45:29.893 --> 45:32.384
But I did.

45:33.397 --> 45:36.855
Last night in church, I gave up.

45:36.934 --> 45:39.725
When I saw that man hit you and you fell down...

45:39.726 --> 45:42.167
I just didn't believe in anything anymore.

45:44.074 --> 45:47.297
But then when you got up, I saw
that you were telling me the truth,

45:47.298 --> 45:48.909
that you were really trying to win.

45:50.047 --> 45:53.983
At that moment, all of my faith
just came flooding back into my heart.

45:54.051 --> 45:59.011
And I didn't care whether you won or
lost, because you were really trying.

45:59.089 --> 46:00.920
Thank you, Cody.

46:06.897 --> 46:10.389
Thank you for my chapel.

46:10.467 --> 46:15.200
Thank you for giving me back
my faith.
