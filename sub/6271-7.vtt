00:09.477 --> 00:12.111
- Whitney is
part of a group of kids

00:12.113 --> 00:13.512
That have been bullying
jody online.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.080
- What?

00:15.082 --> 00:16.148
- She wants us to go in there
with her.

00:16.150 --> 00:19.351
- Where?
To--to therapy?

00:19.353 --> 00:22.154
- Mr. Solloway, do you know
a place called "the end"?

00:22.156 --> 00:24.556
- No, what is it?
- It's a club out in montauk.

00:24.558 --> 00:25.758
Both: Uncle max!

00:25.760 --> 00:27.393
- I didn't know
you invited max.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.228
- Helen the felon.
- Hello.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.096
- Come here.

00:31.098 --> 00:32.364
- You're never going
to be successful

00:32.366 --> 00:33.699
If you only write
one book a decade.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.234
- I'm never going
to be successful?

00:35.236 --> 00:36.268
- That's not what I said.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.269
- You owe me money, hodges.

00:37.271 --> 00:39.204
- You owe me a permit, asshole.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.643
[indistinct whispering]

00:48.581 --> 00:51.116
- Oscar called the police.
- How do you know?

00:51.118 --> 00:52.684
- 'cause I was there.
I saw him do it.

00:52.686 --> 00:54.186
- Cole, we need to dump this
shit, throw it in the ocean.

00:54.188 --> 00:55.554
- Why don't you go back
to the ranch?

00:55.556 --> 00:57.322
Find someplace
on the edge of the property,

00:57.324 --> 00:58.657
Someplace discreet,
make sure nobody's watching.

00:58.659 --> 01:00.192
Dig a hole.
I'll bring the check.

01:00.194 --> 01:01.660
You take hal with you.
- I'm telling you, man,

01:01.662 --> 01:02.661
If you bury it,
someone's going to find it.

01:02.663 --> 01:03.662
- Hal, hal, please, please.

01:03.664 --> 01:04.663
- You deal fucking coke?

01:04.665 --> 01:06.198
Do you know how stupid that is?

01:06.200 --> 01:07.599
- I thought
about what you said before,

01:07.601 --> 01:10.569
And I-I don't want
that life anymore.

01:10.571 --> 01:13.539

to be insane to keep this going.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.561
Because it's our last session
out here,

02:42.563 --> 02:45.631
I thought it was
a good opportunity to check in,

02:45.633 --> 02:47.900
So whitney can share
some feelings

02:47.902 --> 02:52.905
Which have been difficult
for her.

02:52.907 --> 02:57.776
- Okay, so, in terms of, like,

02:57.778 --> 03:00.913
Why this thing happened...

03:00.915 --> 03:04.283
I mean, I definitely
didn't understand

03:04.285 --> 03:07.386
The gravity of the situation.

03:09.389 --> 03:12.691
But I have been extremely
stressed because mom is--

03:12.693 --> 03:14.326
- Address her directly.

03:16.930 --> 03:19.464
- Okay,
because you do put

03:19.466 --> 03:21.266
An extreme amount of pressure
on me.

03:21.268 --> 03:22.968
- I-I don't.
I-I give you--

03:22.970 --> 03:24.937
- Let her speak, please.

03:24.939 --> 03:26.805
- You do, actually.

03:26.807 --> 03:30.542
To be totally fine and okay all
the time, completely together.

03:30.544 --> 03:31.810
You know, nobody can be upset

03:31.812 --> 03:33.545
For more than five seconds
with you.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.947
It's the whole way you are.

03:34.949 --> 03:36.348
Like, even with dad,
you act like

03:36.350 --> 03:37.482
You guys are this perfect couple

03:37.484 --> 03:38.984
When you guys are clearly having

03:38.986 --> 03:42.487
Some serious issues.

03:42.489 --> 03:44.690
- Look, no marriage is perfect.

03:44.692 --> 03:47.559
- Whitney, let's stay focused
on your feelings.

03:47.561 --> 03:50.729
- Well, I feel like
dad is miserable.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.365
- What?

03:53.367 --> 03:55.968
- No, because mom is clearly
having some kind of affair.

03:55.970 --> 03:57.970
- What?
- Wait, what?

03:57.972 --> 03:59.438
- We're still
not allowed to talk?

03:59.440 --> 04:02.307
Look, that is so not true.

04:02.309 --> 04:03.508
- You're not having
some kind of thing with max?

04:03.510 --> 04:04.843
- Max?
- Max?

04:04.845 --> 04:06.511
- You're way off here, whitney.
- No.

04:06.513 --> 04:08.313
- Whitney, could you step
into the waiting room?

04:08.315 --> 04:09.581
I'd like to speak
to your mom and dad privately.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.849
- Which is the waiting room?

04:10.851 --> 04:12.985
- Oh, right, sorry.

04:12.987 --> 04:14.486
I forgot we're not in my office.

04:14.488 --> 04:16.888
Um, how about the kitchen?
Or the hall?

04:16.890 --> 04:19.791
Whichever's more comfortable
for you.

04:26.599 --> 04:28.767
- [sighs]

04:28.769 --> 04:30.936
- So, um...

04:30.938 --> 04:32.738
I'm hearing
that whitney's observations

04:32.740 --> 04:33.872
Are not ringing true to you?

04:33.874 --> 04:35.874
- No.
- Not at all.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.409
- Okay.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.411
Sometimes when a child
is acting out,

04:39.413 --> 04:42.814
It can be the expression
of other crises

04:42.816 --> 04:45.417
In the family system.

04:45.419 --> 04:47.019
I'm wondering if you--

04:47.021 --> 04:48.620
Well, the two of you
might be interested

04:48.622 --> 04:50.555
In doing some work
as a couple.

04:50.557 --> 04:53.025
Not with me
but with a trusted colleague.

04:53.027 --> 04:55.494
- Thanks, but we really don't
need that kind of work, so--

04:55.496 --> 04:59.498
- I think
it would help whitney.

05:01.834 --> 05:03.835
- [sighs]

05:35.868 --> 05:38.337
Let's leave today.

05:40.106 --> 05:41.740
- It's only Tuesday.
- [sighs]

05:41.742 --> 05:43.909
It's time to go home.

05:50.817 --> 05:51.883
- Okay.

05:54.854 --> 05:57.356
- I'm staying till Sunday.
- No, you're not.

05:57.358 --> 05:58.690
- That was the plan,

05:58.692 --> 06:00.125
And that's what
I'm calibrated for.

06:00.127 --> 06:02.728
- Yeah, well, get un-calibrated
and start packing, now.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.963
- My nails are wet.
- I'll do it.

06:04.965 --> 06:07.432
- No, she can do it.
Where does this picture go?

06:07.434 --> 06:09.401
- Right there.

06:11.471 --> 06:13.839
Whitney,

06:13.841 --> 06:16.441
Why would you say something
like that to your therapist?

06:16.443 --> 06:17.976
- Why do you think?

06:17.978 --> 06:20.379
- I think it's difficult for you
to accept responsibility

06:20.381 --> 06:21.880
For what you did to jody.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.915
I think that you're deflecting
the situation.

06:23.917 --> 06:26.752
- Why do you keep denying
my reality?

06:26.754 --> 06:28.120
- I'm not denying your reality.
- Yes, you--

06:28.122 --> 06:30.122
Stop touching my clothes.

06:30.124 --> 06:32.591
- Jesus christ,
I am trying to help you.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.126
- I'm--

06:34.128 --> 06:36.595
- Hey, can someone drive me
to the ranch?

06:36.597 --> 06:37.863
I want to say good-bye.

06:37.865 --> 06:40.031
- You said good-bye.
- No, I didn't.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.500
I was going to say good-bye
this weekend,

06:41.502 --> 06:42.868
And now you're making us
leave early.

06:42.870 --> 06:43.902
- Oh, so first
you didn't want to come,

06:43.904 --> 06:45.470
And now you don't want to leave?

06:45.472 --> 06:47.639
- I have to make an apology.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.508
- Apologize? For what?

06:49.510 --> 06:51.610
- Just--I made a mistake
with a horse.

06:51.612 --> 06:52.744
- So just--
just write a letter.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.479
Okay?
It's more polite.

06:54.481 --> 06:56.882
- No, he wants to accept
responsibility for something.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.517
Why don't you just
run him over there?

06:58.519 --> 07:00.552
- No! I got things to do--
- no? What--

07:00.554 --> 07:03.155
- You do it.
I'll pack the kids up.

07:03.157 --> 07:06.158
- It'll take you,
like, 20 minutes.

- Hey, cole, um...

07:42.930 --> 07:46.598
I wanted to say sorry
about the horse.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.734
- Yeah, that was crazy.

07:49.736 --> 07:51.703
What happened?

07:51.705 --> 07:53.872
- I don't know.

07:55.875 --> 08:00.011
- Well, we got her back,
so it's all okay.

08:00.013 --> 08:02.214
- We're leaving.
Today.

08:02.216 --> 08:03.815
- Back to brooklyn, huh?

08:03.817 --> 08:05.083
- Yeah.
I just wish we lived out here.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.985
- Well, martin,
you were a great hand.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.688
We will miss you.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.223
I'll tell you what,
I'll make you a deal.

08:11.225 --> 08:13.091
If you do good in school
this year,

08:13.093 --> 08:15.560
Next summer when you come back,
we'll make sure we keep a space

08:15.562 --> 08:17.162
Open for you, how's that sound?
- All right.

08:17.164 --> 08:20.499

if you want to say good-bye.

08:22.735 --> 08:25.504
Great kid you got there.

08:25.506 --> 08:26.738

08:26.740 --> 08:28.974
- I'd keep an eye on him.

08:28.976 --> 08:32.978
Seems like he's kind of hungry
for attention.

08:32.980 --> 08:35.647

like any teenage boy.

08:53.733 --> 08:55.100
- That's it?

09:00.773 --> 09:02.774
- What?

09:02.776 --> 09:04.943
- Let's go.

09:06.946 --> 09:11.316
I want to be out of here fast,
so get yourself packed up, okay?

09:11.318 --> 09:13.151
Oh, no performance art.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.554
- I knew you were irrational.
- Irrational, how dare you?

09:15.556 --> 09:16.888
- How dare <i>I?</i>

09:16.890 --> 09:18.623
- Imply I had
some kind of agenda.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.292

with this herself?

09:20.294 --> 09:22.060
I could sue her!

09:22.062 --> 09:23.828
- You guys, it's just
a stupid magazine article.

09:23.830 --> 09:25.664
- She merely observed the truth.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.933
- What, that you write my books?

09:27.935 --> 09:31.636
- Just that I help a great deal.
Collaborate, even.

for 50 years.

- Looks like you got away
with it.

11:14.741 --> 11:17.308
You know what I just realized?

11:17.310 --> 11:21.279
I could tell your wife.

11:21.281 --> 11:23.415
- I have no idea
what you're talking about.

11:23.417 --> 11:25.050
- Yeah, you do.

11:25.052 --> 11:26.885
But I'll tell you what,

11:26.887 --> 11:30.922
How about 10 grand to make sure
helen never finds out, huh?

11:30.924 --> 11:32.424
- You kidding me?

11:32.426 --> 11:35.694
- I know, it's sudden.
I just thought of it.

11:35.696 --> 11:37.896
[car door closes]
[engine starts]

11:37.898 --> 11:39.164
- I don't have
that kind of money.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.899
- Yeah?
Well, I think you can get it.

11:40.901 --> 11:45.904
So I'll give you a week,
and then I'll tell her.

11:45.906 --> 11:49.240
Have a safe trip.
I got your cell.

11:54.313 --> 11:55.980
- Thank you so much, mom.

11:55.982 --> 11:58.116
- And this beautiful face.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.919
What am I going to do
when I can't see it every day?

12:00.921 --> 12:02.353
- You can skype, grandma.

12:02.355 --> 12:05.356
- I can't, and I won't.

12:05.358 --> 12:09.494
But I love you,
my brilliant boy.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.262
- Why don't you guys
get in the car?

12:11.264 --> 12:13.098
- Bye, grandma.
- Bye, honey.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.333
- Is dad going to say good-bye?

12:15.335 --> 12:20.338
- Well, wouldn't be dramatic
enough, now, would it?

12:20.340 --> 12:21.806
- Are you sure
you're going to be okay?

12:21.808 --> 12:24.109
Do you want to come with us?

12:24.111 --> 12:26.411
- Leave him to hole up
with his mistress?

12:26.413 --> 12:28.046
I don't think so.

12:39.525 --> 12:41.760
- What?
- Hey, did you see--

12:41.762 --> 12:43.528
- We're out of here.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.530
- Hey, hey.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.766
- Everything's better now?
- Yes.

12:47.768 --> 12:50.034
[kids chattering]

12:52.037 --> 12:54.506
- Next year
let's just go camping.

12:54.508 --> 12:56.274
- You hate camping.
- Yes.

12:56.276 --> 12:59.911
But they have these luxury tents
now with beds and rugs.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.112
It's called "glamping."

13:01.114 --> 13:03.248
I would do that.

13:05.851 --> 13:09.254
- My spoon, my fork.

13:09.256 --> 13:10.455
- You don't need those.

13:10.457 --> 13:14.259
It's pizza.

13:14.261 --> 13:15.460
- I missed them.

13:15.462 --> 13:16.795
- It's so nice to be able

13:16.797 --> 13:20.431
To talk
while I'm eating again.

13:20.433 --> 13:23.902
- Shit.

13:23.904 --> 13:26.171
They totally screwed up
this pan.

13:26.173 --> 13:27.806
It's all rusted.

13:27.808 --> 13:29.908
- Banister's chipped
on the stairs too.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.876
- Fuck.

13:31.878 --> 13:33.144
- Mom.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.479
- Sorry.
Why are renters such animals?

13:34.481 --> 13:37.015
- That's what the deposit's for.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.984
- This banister's irreplaceable.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.889
- Hey.

13:44.891 --> 13:48.026
We clear our own plates here,
remember?

14:03.509 --> 14:06.044
Oh, fuck.

14:06.046 --> 14:08.413
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:11.183 --> 14:12.951
This is weird.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.353
- Hmm.
- [sighs]

14:15.355 --> 14:17.121
- It's okay, you're tired.

14:17.123 --> 14:21.593
- I know,
but I'm not that tired.

14:21.595 --> 14:27.599
- Maybe your age is catching up
to your legendary hard-on.

14:27.601 --> 14:30.368
- [laughs]

14:30.370 --> 14:32.203
Legendary?
- Mm-hmm.

14:32.205 --> 14:35.106
- Where?
- Right here.

14:35.108 --> 14:39.110
Right here,
in this bedroom.

14:39.112 --> 14:41.145
Legend.

14:42.982 --> 14:45.016
[both sigh]

14:47.486 --> 14:49.954
- So happy we're home.

14:51.957 --> 14:54.325
- Me too.

15:24.990 --> 15:27.525
[phone chimes]

15:34.533 --> 15:37.068
- Yes, but--

15:37.070 --> 15:39.704
I--

15:39.706 --> 15:41.139
That's right, that's right.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.473
Uh-huh, yeah.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.475
We just wanted to confirm
those trades.

15:44.477 --> 15:48.046
Uh-huh, qualcomm, right.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.481
Uh-huh.
[laughs]

15:50.483 --> 15:54.285
Absolutely, we will golf.
Bye now.

15:56.355 --> 15:58.156
Hey, you look like shit, man.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.190
- Thanks, man.

15:59.192 --> 16:00.224
You look like 5 million bucks.

16:00.226 --> 16:01.359
- Totes.

16:01.361 --> 16:05.096
Fucking a 23-year-old, so--

16:05.098 --> 16:08.366
Ah, here we go.

16:08.368 --> 16:09.634
Let's get it.
[grunts]

16:09.636 --> 16:11.302
- What the hell are you doing?

16:11.304 --> 16:15.606
- Getting huge, obviously.
What are you doing?

16:15.608 --> 16:19.177
God almighty, I'm strong.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.346
- I need a big favor.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.181
- Anything. Maybe.

16:23.183 --> 16:25.516
What?

16:25.518 --> 16:26.651
- It's money.

16:26.653 --> 16:29.420
- Okay, how much?

16:31.457 --> 16:35.560
Oh, shit, that much, huh?

16:38.197 --> 16:39.330
- 10 grand.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.232
- Wow, that's...

16:41.234 --> 16:44.635
Real money.
Need a new roof or something?

16:44.637 --> 16:47.271
- Yeah.

16:48.540 --> 16:50.475
- Noah, come on, man.

16:50.477 --> 16:55.213
Can't help you out unless you
tell me what it's for.

16:55.215 --> 16:58.349
- I'm being blackmailed.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.685
- What?

17:00.687 --> 17:02.286
Dude.

17:07.226 --> 17:09.160
Why?

17:11.096 --> 17:14.098
- I had an affair.
It's over now.

17:14.100 --> 17:17.435
- Wait, you?

17:17.437 --> 17:19.637
No.

17:19.639 --> 17:21.506
- Someone knows.
He's scum.

17:21.508 --> 17:24.509
He's threatened to tell helen.

17:29.381 --> 17:32.750
- Well, we can't let helen know.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.188
[clears throat]

17:37.190 --> 17:38.790
- I'll pay you back.

17:38.792 --> 17:40.792
- Stop.

17:44.430 --> 17:46.330
Listen to me.

17:46.332 --> 17:48.666
Just...

17:48.668 --> 17:50.568
Whatever you do,

17:50.570 --> 17:53.704
Don't get all sensitive
and tell helen

17:53.706 --> 17:56.808
To make yourself feel better.

17:56.810 --> 17:59.143
That will help no one.

17:59.145 --> 18:00.478
- I won't.

18:04.583 --> 18:07.418
- [exhales]

18:07.420 --> 18:09.153
Fuck you.

18:09.155 --> 18:11.355
- Thanks, man.

18:34.580 --> 18:36.781
[panting]

18:45.624 --> 18:48.659
[groaning]

19:14.419 --> 19:16.387
- Maybe you're anemic.

19:16.389 --> 19:18.356
Shortness of breath, dizziness?

19:18.358 --> 19:19.790
- Really felt like my heart.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.759
- Yeah, but you seem okay now.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.895
- They said it might
be a heart attack.

19:23.897 --> 19:25.630
You know, you're not going
to make her come back

19:25.632 --> 19:27.265
By looking for her.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.900
- Well, she is, so I did.

19:28.902 --> 19:31.502
- Mr., uh, solloway.
- Yes?

19:31.504 --> 19:34.939
- Good news, the test came back
negative for any cardiac event.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.374
- [sighs]

19:36.376 --> 19:38.242
- Do you think he's anemic?

19:38.244 --> 19:40.578
- Uh, no, the blood work
was normal.

19:40.580 --> 19:43.247
It seems like
it was just a panic attack.

19:43.249 --> 19:44.916
- Panic attack?
You sure?

19:44.918 --> 19:46.417
I mean, it really felt
like my heart.

19:46.419 --> 19:47.852
- They can.

19:47.854 --> 19:50.721
About 20% of visits to the e.R.
Are panic attacks.

19:50.723 --> 19:51.722
They're caused by stress.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.191
- Stress?
Come on.

19:53.193 --> 19:55.193
- We just got back
from vacation.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.595
- Do you have kids?
- Four.

19:57.597 --> 19:58.796
- Then you have stress.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.731
If it happens again,
see a therapist.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.601
You can check out now.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.543
- It really was
a stressful summer.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.546
It was awful, really,
with my dad and whitney,

20:15.548 --> 20:16.948
And I'm sorry I made you
go there again.

20:16.950 --> 20:18.749
I'm sorry I make you
go there every year.

20:18.751 --> 20:21.552
- I'm sorry we can't afford
to go anywhere else.

20:21.554 --> 20:22.987
- Well, let's just do it.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.722
Let's just go away,
the two of us,

20:24.724 --> 20:26.457
And my mom can watch the kids
for a weekend,

20:26.459 --> 20:30.228
And we'll just be together
and--and decompress.

20:33.732 --> 20:36.367
- Helen, I--

20:40.739 --> 20:41.839
- Uh-oh.

20:45.377 --> 20:47.912
- I'm so sorry.

20:50.582 --> 20:53.985
I was so stupid.

20:53.987 --> 20:55.987
- Shit.

21:01.760 --> 21:05.730
- And it was nothing.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.498
I wanted just to pretend
it never happened,

21:07.500 --> 21:12.503
'cause it meant nothing, but...

21:12.505 --> 21:16.340
I-I-I can't...

21:16.342 --> 21:19.744
I can't keep it from you.
I--

21:23.915 --> 21:26.784
[sighs]

21:26.786 --> 21:30.421
I had a fling this summer.

21:32.391 --> 21:34.825
- A fling?

21:36.795 --> 21:40.331
So what, like, once?

21:42.968 --> 21:45.970
- A few times.

21:52.444 --> 21:54.645
- Uh, with who?

21:54.647 --> 21:56.981
- It doesn't matter--
- the waitress?

21:58.917 --> 22:01.385
Alison?

22:03.388 --> 22:06.657
I knew it.

22:06.659 --> 22:09.627
You know, I fucking knew it.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.330
How long?

22:15.534 --> 22:18.069
- Not long.
- How long?

22:18.071 --> 22:19.804
- A few weeks.
- Like, three?

22:19.806 --> 22:21.105
- No.
- Five?

22:21.107 --> 22:22.740
- Maybe eight.

22:22.742 --> 22:24.842
- Eight.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.744
Wow, eight.

22:26.746 --> 22:29.814
The whole fucking summer.

22:33.418 --> 22:37.755
That makes me feel sick.

22:37.757 --> 22:40.558
- I am so sorry.

22:53.705 --> 22:57.108
- He's okay.

22:57.110 --> 22:58.709
- Hey.
- Daddy!

22:58.711 --> 23:00.044
- Dad.

23:00.046 --> 23:03.147
- Ooh, ay-yi-yi.
[murmurs]

23:03.149 --> 23:05.116
I'm fine, you guys.
I'm fine.

23:05.118 --> 23:06.617
- Are you wounded, daddy?

23:06.619 --> 23:09.387
- No, no, no, not at all.
Look, no blood.

23:09.389 --> 23:11.655
- Was it a stroke?
- No, I just went for a run.

23:11.657 --> 23:13.491
And I got dehydrated,
so I got dizzy.

23:13.493 --> 23:15.993
- Which is a good reminder to
everybody to drink lots of water

23:15.995 --> 23:17.528
When it's this hot out.

23:17.530 --> 23:19.663
- You went to the hospital
for being dizzy?

23:19.665 --> 23:21.732
- Whitney should be in
the hospital all the time then.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.134
- [laughs]

23:23.136 --> 23:25.936
No, I fainted.
Come on, I'm fine now.

23:29.141 --> 23:31.742
- Mommy, come in.

23:43.488 --> 23:46.957
- Hillary clinton fainted
because she was dehydrated once.

23:46.959 --> 23:50.694
- Yes.
It was exactly like that.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.902
- What are you doing?

23:57.904 --> 24:01.172
- I didn't want us on display.

24:04.176 --> 24:09.747
- Uh, I really don't know
how to process this.

24:14.920 --> 24:16.454
Part of me wants you

24:16.456 --> 24:20.524
To walk me through every moment,

24:20.526 --> 24:22.793
Um...

24:22.795 --> 24:24.662
Of what happened
because it happened to you

24:24.664 --> 24:28.199
And...

24:28.201 --> 24:30.668
I always know everything
that happens to you.

24:30.670 --> 24:32.870
[sniffles]

24:32.872 --> 24:35.473
Um, don't I?

24:35.475 --> 24:39.243
I mean, I-I did,
I think.

24:39.245 --> 24:40.878
- Yes.

24:44.816 --> 24:47.818
- Yes.
So it's--

24:47.820 --> 24:49.954
Um, it's just
that you lied to me

24:49.956 --> 24:51.155
For eight weeks.

24:51.157 --> 24:52.690
Eight--probably longer,

24:52.692 --> 24:54.225
You know,
when you were thinking about it.

24:54.227 --> 24:56.093
- Haven't you ever
thought about it?

24:56.095 --> 24:59.864
- You know, this is not about
what I may have thought of.

24:59.866 --> 25:01.165
Please.

25:01.167 --> 25:03.167
- Leon?
- You knew about leon.

25:03.169 --> 25:06.237
It was not some--some--
some deep hidden thing.

25:06.239 --> 25:07.872
- Well, I only knew about it
because it was obvious,

25:07.874 --> 25:09.640
Not because you told me.
- Nothing happened!

25:09.642 --> 25:11.008
- I'm just saying,
we don't talk about everything.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.843
- So you're saying
that what you did

25:12.845 --> 25:18.048
Is because our marriage
and our friendship is a lie?

25:18.050 --> 25:20.584
- [sighs]

25:20.586 --> 25:22.720
I don't know why I did it.

25:22.722 --> 25:26.257
- Well, what--what am I
supposed to do with that?

25:26.259 --> 25:29.026
- What matters is,
I stopped,

25:29.028 --> 25:30.995
Because I love you
and I love our life.

25:30.997 --> 25:33.597
- If you loved me
and you loved our life,

25:33.599 --> 25:36.534
You would not have done it,
because it is a destruction.

25:36.536 --> 25:39.970
It is a destructive thing.
For a waitress?

25:44.009 --> 25:46.677
- It was a very, very, very,
very stupid thing.

25:46.679 --> 25:49.947
- Yeah.

25:49.949 --> 25:52.149
- I don't know, I've been
going through something.

25:52.151 --> 25:53.317
Not about you,
it's about myself.

25:53.319 --> 25:56.186
- Seriously?

25:56.188 --> 25:57.888
How old is she, 22?

25:57.890 --> 25:59.690
- Come on, what are you saying?

25:59.692 --> 26:01.225
What, if she'd been
a 50-year-old english professor,

26:01.227 --> 26:02.326
Would that make this better?

26:02.328 --> 26:04.028
- Fuck you.

26:06.298 --> 26:07.965
- She was in a very dark place,

26:07.967 --> 26:09.667
And she came after me
pretty hard.

26:09.669 --> 26:12.036
- Oh, my god,
this is disgusting.

26:15.040 --> 26:19.343
- I was feeling weak,
I guess.

26:19.345 --> 26:22.346
I'd finally had a book
published, took ten years,

26:22.348 --> 26:25.215
And it was just nothing.

26:25.217 --> 26:26.951
Nobody read it.

26:26.953 --> 26:28.819
- People read it.
- No one fucking read it.

26:28.821 --> 26:32.323
20 people read it.
People I know.

26:32.325 --> 26:35.726
- And it got good reviews.
- Yeah, and very bad reviews.

26:40.065 --> 26:42.266
Then being around your dad
with his billion books sold,

26:42.268 --> 26:44.134
And he sucks.
I'm good.

26:44.136 --> 26:46.737
At least I thought I was.
Maybe I'm not.

26:46.739 --> 26:49.106
And the pressure on
this second book from you too.

26:49.108 --> 26:51.275
- I was trying
to be supportive--

26:51.277 --> 26:52.743
- Maybe it just made me
feel better

26:52.745 --> 26:55.679
To be seen as someone.

26:55.681 --> 26:59.083
Something successful.

27:00.752 --> 27:06.023
You just see me
as potential unfulfilled.

27:06.025 --> 27:09.693
You're waiting for the guy
you married to...

27:09.695 --> 27:10.828
Happen.

27:16.167 --> 27:19.103
- Only because you are.

27:21.906 --> 27:25.109
- Helen, I love you so much.

27:25.111 --> 27:28.212
- [sighs]

27:38.990 --> 27:41.659
[sniffles]

28:13.158 --> 28:15.359
[phone chimes]

28:25.970 --> 28:28.372
[line rings]

28:28.374 --> 28:31.909
- Noah, been waiting
for your call.

28:31.911 --> 28:33.777
- I told her,

28:33.779 --> 28:37.247
So you can go fuck yourself.

29:10.849 --> 29:12.950
[birds calling]

29:48.987 --> 29:50.988
[camera shutter clicks]

30:04.335 --> 30:06.336
[camera shutter clicks]

30:37.569 --> 30:40.470
[door opens]

30:40.472 --> 30:42.873
[door closes]

30:44.909 --> 30:48.979
- The whole thing's rotten.
We gotta replace it.

30:48.981 --> 30:51.381
- Well, maybe we should just
repaint it.

30:51.383 --> 30:53.250
- Why?

30:53.252 --> 30:57.487
- Because it would look better.

30:57.489 --> 31:01.058
- No, it wouldn't.
It would just look painted.

31:02.594 --> 31:04.595
- [sighs]

31:13.538 --> 31:15.239
- Martin's been a great help
around here.

31:15.241 --> 31:16.340
Been really happy
to have him around.

31:16.342 --> 31:18.208
- Martin, helpful?

31:18.210 --> 31:20.944
You sure we're talking
about the same kid?

31:20.946 --> 31:23.280
- You know, my impression is,
he's just...

31:23.282 --> 31:25.215
Hungry for attention.

31:25.217 --> 31:28.418
- Well,
thanks for the parenting advice.

31:28.420 --> 31:31.421
Why don't you get back to me
when you have a teenage son?

31:37.962 --> 31:42.099
- Uh, sorry. Mr. Solloway,
this is my wife, alison.

31:42.101 --> 31:44.234
- Hi. I think--
I think we met before.

31:44.236 --> 31:47.371
You're a waitress
at the lobster roll, right?

31:47.373 --> 31:50.507
- Yeah, that's right.

31:50.509 --> 31:52.175
- Well, we'll see you
next summer?

31:52.177 --> 31:54.978
- Yeah.
Thanks a lot.

31:54.980 --> 31:58.081
Come on, martin!
Let's go!

32:05.323 --> 32:07.991
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:07.993 --> 32:10.193
- Is he here?
- No.

32:10.195 --> 32:12.029
- Did he put the checks
on the board?

32:12.031 --> 32:14.398
- Of course not.
- Ugh.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.667
Oh, don't go back to new york.

32:16.669 --> 32:19.002
Come live with me in my house.

32:19.004 --> 32:22.339
- Don't go back to your house.
Come live with me in new york.

32:22.341 --> 32:24.675
- I wish I could.

32:24.677 --> 32:27.144
- You seem better this summer.

32:27.146 --> 32:28.679
- I guess.

32:28.681 --> 32:30.414
[sighs]
winter's rough, though.

32:30.416 --> 32:32.549
- [sighs]
winter's so rough.

32:32.551 --> 32:35.285
Even in brooklyn.
Visit me a lot.

32:35.287 --> 32:38.155
We'll go to museums
and just lady out.

32:38.157 --> 32:41.458
- [chuckles]
okay, I will.

32:41.460 --> 32:45.462
- Hmm, bailey.
I thought you quit.

32:45.464 --> 32:49.566
- Can I get my last check,
please?

32:49.568 --> 32:52.970
- You're kidding me, right?
[chuckles]

32:52.972 --> 32:54.972
Get the fuck out of here.

32:59.477 --> 33:02.346
- Fine.

33:02.348 --> 33:05.415
I'll take these instead.

33:34.212 --> 33:35.779
Hey.
- Hey.

33:35.781 --> 33:38.615
- I got you some pies.
- Yum.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.350
- Can I help in any way?

33:40.352 --> 33:43.020
- Can you go in the liquor
cabinet and grab me some sherry?

33:43.022 --> 33:44.087
- Yeah.
- I'll put these in the oven,

33:44.089 --> 33:46.757
Keep 'em warm.
- Okay.

33:46.759 --> 33:49.292
- I think we should lay low.

33:49.294 --> 33:51.028
We're giving him
what he wants.

33:51.030 --> 33:54.031
We'll support his stupid
bowling alley and move on.

33:54.033 --> 33:57.401
- Still think we should beat
the shit out of him.

33:57.403 --> 33:58.802
- We're not thugs.

33:58.804 --> 34:00.237
- What if we just sell
the rest of the stash

34:00.239 --> 34:01.705
Back to the dealers?

34:01.707 --> 34:03.807
- [laughs]
doesn't work that way, bro.

34:03.809 --> 34:05.642
- What are you talking about?

34:05.644 --> 34:07.644
- Oscar.

34:09.380 --> 34:14.117
I think we should go over there
and make peace tonight.

34:14.119 --> 34:17.054
Let him know we support
his plan, turn him into an ally.

34:20.691 --> 34:23.126
- There.
- Thank you, dear.

34:23.128 --> 34:25.262
Would you mind making a salad?

34:25.264 --> 34:27.230
- Not at all.

34:29.133 --> 34:32.335
- Did I ever tell you about cole
and the stroller?

34:32.337 --> 34:35.272
- Cole and the stroller?
No.

34:35.274 --> 34:38.075
- I was just thinking about it
for some reason.

34:38.077 --> 34:40.444
- What's the story?

34:40.446 --> 34:43.580
- One day,
when he was really little,

34:43.582 --> 34:47.451
Maybe a year, maybe less,

34:47.453 --> 34:49.553
I took him grocery shopping
in his stroller--

34:49.555 --> 34:52.622
This was before the days
when strollers had brakes--

34:52.624 --> 34:54.357
And I parked it up on the curb,

34:54.359 --> 34:57.694
Which I didn't realize
was on a slight incline.

34:57.696 --> 35:00.430
And I turned away to load
the groceries in,

35:00.432 --> 35:03.300
And the stroller started rolling
into traffic.

35:03.302 --> 35:04.634
I ran after it.
I caught it.

35:04.636 --> 35:06.303
Cole was fine.

35:06.305 --> 35:07.704
He thought it was funny.

35:07.706 --> 35:10.574
I was really shaken up
by the whole thing.

35:10.576 --> 35:14.211
When I thought about it later,
it occurred to me,

35:14.213 --> 35:15.846
I was running
after the stroller

35:15.848 --> 35:19.382
Before I even had the conscious
thought "it's rolling."

35:19.384 --> 35:21.718
Some kind of instinct.

35:21.720 --> 35:24.387
I tried to remember the first
time that I saw it move,

35:24.389 --> 35:29.659
But the more I tried,
the more I realized I hadn't.

35:29.661 --> 35:31.261
- What do you mean?

35:31.263 --> 35:34.131
- I was turned away.
I hadn't seen anything.

35:34.133 --> 35:37.667
I just knew somehow
that he was in danger.

35:39.904 --> 35:43.740
It still happens...
With my boys.

35:47.345 --> 35:53.350
I know when something
is about to hurt one of them.

35:53.352 --> 35:55.519
Who's noah?

35:55.521 --> 35:57.554
- What?

36:00.224 --> 36:03.293
[paper rustling]

36:03.295 --> 36:06.463
- It was stuck
to the bottom of the pie box.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.902
- I don't know.

36:20.578 --> 36:22.245
Can I see it?

36:22.247 --> 36:23.914
- You're screwing around?
- Cherry, please--

36:23.916 --> 36:25.382
- After everything
he's done for you,

36:25.384 --> 36:26.917
Everything we've all done
for you.

36:26.919 --> 36:29.819
- Can I please just see
what's in that note? Plea--

36:29.821 --> 36:32.189
Cherry.

36:45.570 --> 36:47.671
- I want you to end it.

36:47.673 --> 36:49.539
- It's already done.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.841
- Good.

36:51.843 --> 36:55.745
And you will never tell cole.

36:55.747 --> 37:00.617
Because you know that doing so
is a selfish act.

37:00.619 --> 37:04.221
You've been selfish enough
already.

37:04.223 --> 37:06.723
- I'm going home.
- No, you're not.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.959
- You're gonna stay for dinner.

37:08.961 --> 37:12.829
You're gonna help me serve.

37:12.831 --> 37:15.332
Use this one.

37:15.334 --> 37:17.367
It's sharper.

37:20.304 --> 37:22.439
[chopping]

37:33.985 --> 37:35.585
- So who's your new girl,
scotty?

37:35.587 --> 37:37.454
- I have no idea
what you're talking about.

37:37.456 --> 37:38.588
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

37:38.590 --> 37:39.990
- I saw you down
at the ditch witch

37:39.992 --> 37:41.491
The other day
with some little brunette.

37:41.493 --> 37:43.727
- Mk, if I had to keep track

37:43.729 --> 37:45.729
Of every little brunette
who tried to get in my pants,

37:45.731 --> 37:46.930
I'd have to hire a bookkeeper.

37:46.932 --> 37:48.732
[others groan]

37:48.734 --> 37:51.534
- Anyway, mom,
this food is great.

37:51.536 --> 37:52.602
Thank you for cooking it.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.337
- My pleasure.

37:54.339 --> 37:57.340
[voices fade]

38:20.564 --> 38:23.800
- We're just here to apologize.
Nothing else, got it?

38:23.802 --> 38:26.403
- Yep.
Got it.

38:26.405 --> 38:28.438
- You want to wait in the car?

38:28.440 --> 38:30.440
- No.
I'll come.

39:01.472 --> 39:03.073
- Oh.

39:03.075 --> 39:08.078
To what do I owe this visit
from such an esteemed family?

39:08.080 --> 39:09.946
- We're here to apologize.

39:09.948 --> 39:12.115
I don't like change,
but I don't like being at war

39:12.117 --> 39:13.950
With my neighbors either.

39:13.952 --> 39:17.821
We all gotta do what we gotta do
to survive out here, right?

39:17.823 --> 39:19.422
- Yeah, exactly.

39:19.424 --> 39:22.425
- So I'm gonna write you
a letter of support.

39:22.427 --> 39:25.862
- And you are not gonna fuck
with us ever again.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.430
- Peace?

39:27.432 --> 39:30.433
- Yeah.
All right, peace.

39:32.837 --> 39:34.738
- Okay, then.
Good night.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.973
- Thanks for coming by, guys.

39:36.975 --> 39:38.575
[groans]

39:38.577 --> 39:39.642
- Fuck's sakes, scotty.

39:39.644 --> 39:40.744
Come on, man!

39:40.746 --> 39:41.745
- Fuck.

39:41.747 --> 39:43.480
- Get in the car.

39:43.482 --> 39:45.982
- Jesus.
- You okay?

39:45.984 --> 39:47.984
- [stammers]

39:49.887 --> 39:53.456
Hey.

39:53.458 --> 39:55.625
You ever ask her
how she found out, huh?

39:55.627 --> 39:56.860
- Let's go.

39:56.862 --> 39:58.762
- Who told her
I called the cops?

39:58.764 --> 40:00.163
- She saw you call the cops.
- Cole, come on.

40:00.165 --> 40:02.732
- No, she didn't.

40:02.734 --> 40:05.535
No, she wasn't even there.
You know who was there?

40:08.739 --> 40:11.007
The guy she's fucking.

40:12.877 --> 40:15.945
[both grunting]

40:15.947 --> 40:17.013
[punches landing]

40:46.210 --> 40:47.744
[liquid pouring]

40:51.449 --> 40:54.784
- Do I know him?

40:54.786 --> 40:56.786
- No.

41:01.525 --> 41:03.493
- Is he from here?

41:05.863 --> 41:07.864
- No.

41:10.534 --> 41:12.469
- Good.

41:12.471 --> 41:14.504
Then it's your problem.
You deal with it.

41:30.020 --> 41:33.156
- I think I should go away
for a few days.

41:37.127 --> 41:39.162
- Good idea.

41:45.970 --> 41:47.971
[indistinct chatter]

42:02.853 --> 42:06.523
- I can't believe oscar knew
this was happening before I did.

42:06.525 --> 42:09.259
- I'm sorry.

42:09.261 --> 42:12.896
[laid-back music]

42:12.898 --> 42:15.598
- What do you think
was in the note?

42:15.600 --> 42:18.868
- I have no idea.
- Ugh.

42:18.870 --> 42:21.804
- I know this sounds crazy,
but I--

42:21.806 --> 42:25.074
I suddenly feel like
he's my real life,

42:25.076 --> 42:29.612
And everything else,
all the days I'm living through,

42:29.614 --> 42:34.918
Are just a memory or something.

42:34.920 --> 42:37.754
God, I'm high.

42:37.756 --> 42:39.656
I'm really high.
- Mm-hmm.

42:39.658 --> 42:40.690
- [chuckles]

42:44.828 --> 42:48.898
- Do you remember those giant
oreos we had when we were kids?

42:48.900 --> 42:52.835
They were, like--
like, as big as your face.

42:54.171 --> 42:57.674
What happened to those?
Did I--did I dream them?

42:57.676 --> 42:59.042
I don't think so.

42:59.044 --> 43:01.644
- I found his address.

43:01.646 --> 43:03.179
- Jesus, how?

- Technology.

43:05.650 --> 43:07.216
I'm emailing it to you.

43:07.218 --> 43:08.251
- You can just do that?

43:08.253 --> 43:11.254
- Yeah, for a little money.

Do you wanna go?

43:14.125 --> 43:16.092
- No.

43:16.094 --> 43:18.928
- Fine.

43:18.930 --> 43:22.131
How about his wife's store?

43:22.133 --> 43:23.700
- You found that too?

43:23.702 --> 43:25.001
- Yup.

43:25.003 --> 43:28.738
It's not far from here.

43:28.740 --> 43:31.741
- Not going.

alison...

43:35.347 --> 43:37.213
Enough with the good girl act.

43:37.215 --> 43:39.816
You're in love
with a married man.

43:39.818 --> 43:42.819
You want him to leave his wife
and be with you, admit it.

43:42.821 --> 43:45.254
- No.
No, that's not true.

43:45.256 --> 43:47.957
- Okay, fine.

43:49.960 --> 43:52.362
I'm going to the store.

43:52.364 --> 43:54.097
I gotta buy my mother
a birthday gift.

43:54.099 --> 43:56.366
You can just stay here
and be fat.

43:56.368 --> 43:57.367
- Are you going now?

43:57.369 --> 43:59.335
- Yeah.

44:05.309 --> 44:07.310
- All right, wait.

44:12.983 --> 44:15.652

44:22.660 --> 44:26.663

For my niece, huh?

44:29.667 --> 44:31.300
- Um, these light bulbs
are amazing.

44:31.302 --> 44:33.770
The light is really soft,
it's almost incandescent.

44:33.772 --> 44:35.872
And you don't have
to replace them.

44:35.874 --> 44:38.007
And they last for
about 20 years, I'm not kidding.

44:38.009 --> 44:42.345
- I need those.
A lot of them.

44:42.347 --> 44:44.047
- Okay.

44:44.049 --> 44:45.048
Great.

44:45.050 --> 44:46.683
- Okay.

44:51.355 --> 44:54.290

44:54.292 --> 44:56.893
Alison, right?

44:56.895 --> 44:59.796
- Hi. [chuckles]
yeah.

44:59.798 --> 45:03.800
- What are--do you...
Live in the city?

45:03.802 --> 45:06.969
- No, no, I'm, um--
I'm just visiting, I--

45:06.971 --> 45:08.204
I like in montauk.

45:08.206 --> 45:12.041
- That's what I thought, yeah.

45:12.043 --> 45:14.043
Um...

45:14.045 --> 45:17.046
Did you just wander in here?
[laughs]

45:17.048 --> 45:20.950
- Uh...Well, my friend
is looking for a gift.

45:20.952 --> 45:21.951
- Hi.
- Hi.

45:21.953 --> 45:23.086
- Can I help you with something?

45:23.088 --> 45:25.988
- I'm just browsing.
- Okay.

45:30.060 --> 45:33.062
- Listen...

45:33.064 --> 45:35.798
I never thanked you.

45:35.800 --> 45:37.333
- For what?

45:37.335 --> 45:40.937
- For what you did for
my daughter the day she choked.

45:40.939 --> 45:42.805
- Oh.
It was nothing.

45:42.807 --> 45:45.808
- No, it wasn't.

45:56.286 --> 45:57.987
- Helen, your husband's
on the phone.

45:57.989 --> 45:58.988
He says--

[bells jingle]

46:04.261 --> 46:05.995

46:05.997 --> 46:07.497
Are you all right?

I just need to be alone.

46:10.401 --> 46:14.370

See you back at the apartment?

46:14.372 --> 46:16.839

- Hey.
- Cole's here.

47:35.587 --> 47:37.587
- What?

47:46.864 --> 47:48.998
What are you doing here?

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
- I needed to talk to you.

47:51.002 --> 47:52.468
- I'm going to the store.

This is your apartment.

47:54.239 --> 47:57.273
- It's okay.
I need something.

48:12.222 --> 48:14.490
- The coke is gone.

48:14.492 --> 48:16.525
- What do you mean? I--
- I mean it's gone.

48:16.527 --> 48:19.562
We buried it, we went to
dig it up, and it wasn't there.

48:23.500 --> 48:25.301
Who's the guy?

48:25.303 --> 48:28.638
- What?
- Who else did you tell?

48:28.640 --> 48:30.406
- [scoffs] cole...
- Who else knows about this?

48:30.408 --> 48:32.508
- He didn't take your drugs.

48:32.510 --> 48:34.243
- How could you possibly
know that?

48:34.245 --> 48:35.578
- He's not
that kind of person.

48:35.580 --> 48:37.580
- Really?

48:37.582 --> 48:40.383
He'd fuck another man's wife,
but he draws the line at theft?

48:40.385 --> 48:44.987
Sounds like
a regular samaritan.

48:44.989 --> 48:47.023
Do you understand how much money
we just lost?

48:47.025 --> 48:48.457
- Yes, I--
- do you even care anymore?

48:48.459 --> 48:50.593
- Of course I care.
- Good, then just tell me!

48:50.595 --> 48:53.262
Who else knew?
- Knew what, that we deal coke?

48:53.264 --> 48:55.464
For christ's sake, cole,
the whole town knew!

48:55.466 --> 48:57.033
Oscar probably
dug it up himself.

48:57.035 --> 48:58.434
A-and I don't even know
where you buried--

48:58.436 --> 48:59.568
- [shouts]
why won't you just tell me

48:59.570 --> 49:02.605
Who you're fucking?

49:15.352 --> 49:17.320
- Noah solloway.

49:17.322 --> 49:19.956
- Who the fuck is no--

49:25.295 --> 49:27.496
Martin's dad?

49:41.311 --> 49:42.511
Why?

49:52.322 --> 49:55.624
This place is like hell.

49:55.626 --> 49:58.461
- I kind of like it.

49:58.463 --> 50:00.629
- Do you smell that?

50:00.631 --> 50:04.667
You'd have to have a death wish
to want to live here.

50:09.639 --> 50:13.075
Was it something I did?

50:13.077 --> 50:15.044
- No.

50:24.154 --> 50:27.757
- Oh, I feel like
I'm gonna puke.

50:27.759 --> 50:31.293
Don't sit on that.
Don't, don't.

50:36.666 --> 50:39.702
Don't get your dress dirty.

50:50.447 --> 50:53.783
- I'm so sorry.

51:04.127 --> 51:06.395
- When my dad died,

51:06.397 --> 51:11.267
I figured out this trick
for dealing with the pain

51:11.269 --> 51:14.603
'cause it'd come in waves,
you know.

51:14.605 --> 51:17.606
And just like a wave,

51:17.608 --> 51:21.677
Eventually it'd pass, so...

51:21.679 --> 51:24.713
I just--
I'd start to count.

51:24.715 --> 51:30.653
1, 2, 3, sometimes 20,
sometimes 100.

51:32.689 --> 51:35.291
One time I made it all the way
up to 3,000.

51:38.562 --> 51:42.164
I knew if I could just keep
on counting that, eventually,

51:42.166 --> 51:44.133
It would pass.

51:56.613 --> 52:01.450
So when--when gabriel died,

52:01.452 --> 52:04.253
I tried that again.

52:06.223 --> 52:08.124
Wake up in the middle of
the night, and I'd be sweating,

52:08.126 --> 52:11.594
And I would just feel that
darkness bearing down on me,

52:11.596 --> 52:14.663
And I would--

52:14.665 --> 52:18.267
I'd try counting, but...

52:18.269 --> 52:22.605
This time
it just wouldn't work.

52:22.607 --> 52:24.807
It was just too dark,

52:24.809 --> 52:29.778
And I-I'd forget the numbers,

52:29.780 --> 52:31.647
Forget what order
they're supposed to come in,

52:31.649 --> 52:34.683
And the only thing...

52:38.288 --> 52:40.756
The only thing that made it
better for me,

52:40.758 --> 52:46.395
Made it so I could just breathe,
just for a second, was you.

52:46.397 --> 52:50.799
And I thought if we could just
keep on moving forward--

52:50.801 --> 52:52.801
If we could just move forward
that, eventually,

52:52.803 --> 52:56.505
Everything was gonna
get better.

53:00.377 --> 53:02.545
[sighs]

53:02.547 --> 53:07.183
But it didn't get better.
It just got worse.

53:19.462 --> 53:24.700
Sometimes I wonder
if it's him.

53:24.702 --> 53:28.737
This is his way of telling us
that if he can't be here,

53:28.739 --> 53:31.540
Then we can't either.
- No.

53:31.542 --> 53:34.510
No, no, it's not him.

53:39.316 --> 53:42.351

54:27.865 --> 54:30.532
- Something's happened to hal.

54:35.872 --> 54:36.939
- How is he?

54:36.941 --> 54:38.941
- He's gonna be okay, they said.

54:38.943 --> 54:41.043
- Look at him.

54:41.045 --> 54:42.611
- [sighs]

54:42.613 --> 54:46.615
What the fuck was he thinking?

54:46.617 --> 54:48.484
Trying to give the drugs
back to the dealers?

54:48.486 --> 54:50.419
- He was trying
to neutralize our debt.

54:50.421 --> 54:51.754
- And what did he expect
was gonna happen?

54:51.756 --> 54:52.955
They were gonna write him
a thank-you card

54:52.957 --> 54:54.757
And then cut him
a goddamn check?

54:54.759 --> 54:56.825
- Cole.

55:04.634 --> 55:06.502
- How long is
he gonna be here for?

55:06.504 --> 55:09.038
- The doctor says
at least two more weeks,

55:09.040 --> 55:11.040
Maybe a month.

55:14.511 --> 55:16.478
- We have to sell the ranch.

55:19.049 --> 55:21.550
- Don't be ridiculous.
- We have no choice.

55:21.552 --> 55:24.386
We just lost 100 grand.

55:24.388 --> 55:25.788
- Let me handle it.

55:25.790 --> 55:27.589
- No, mom,

55:27.591 --> 55:29.391
You gotta stop with this--
you can't just pretend like

55:29.393 --> 55:30.926
Everything's all right
and none of this happened.

55:30.928 --> 55:32.528
- I'll cover it.
I'll get a loan from the bank.

55:32.530 --> 55:35.998
- No.
I can't do this anymore.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.801
This trouble isn't worth it.

55:38.803 --> 55:40.669
- Cole...

55:40.671 --> 55:41.937
- We can talk about this
tomorrow.

55:41.939 --> 55:43.072
We're going home.

55:43.074 --> 55:44.473
- You're leaving?

55:44.475 --> 55:45.841
- Your brother is
in the hospital.

55:45.843 --> 55:49.411
- I can see that.

55:49.413 --> 55:50.813
I'll be here first thing
tomorrow morning,

55:50.815 --> 55:53.482
