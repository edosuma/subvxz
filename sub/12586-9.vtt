WEBVTT

00:47.255 --> 00:51.092
No! No! No! I've been burgled!

00:51.301 --> 00:52.927
-

00:53.386 --> 00:55.221
-

00:55.305 --> 00:57.348
-
My Spring Harvest Classic!

00:57.432 --> 01:00.727
The jewel of my basket collection
has been taken...

01:02.395 --> 01:03.480
My basket!

01:03.563 --> 01:04.522
-
I'm sorry, sug.

01:04.606 --> 01:06.691
To me, it's just a container
to hold things.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.485
"Just a container?"

01:08.568 --> 01:11.029
I'll tell you what this basket contains.

01:11.112 --> 01:13.073
Unconditional love.

01:19.704 --> 01:22.791
Would you like some soda, basket?

01:22.874 --> 01:24.459
I would love some soda.

01:24.542 --> 01:26.086
Thanks, Dale. I love you.

01:29.255 --> 01:30.423
Okay, sug.

01:30.507 --> 01:31.925
Whatever you say.

01:32.008 --> 01:34.511
I just wish you wouldn't spend
so much money on these things.

01:34.594 --> 01:37.430
Do you have any idea
how expensive our bills are?

01:40.183 --> 01:42.936
Maybe you should think
about getting another job.

01:43.978 --> 01:47.607
I mean, if an exterminator
doesn't kill any bugs or make any money,

01:47.690 --> 01:49.150
does he even have a job?

01:50.151 --> 01:54.114
I am an exterminator, Nancy.
It's in my bones.

01:54.197 --> 01:56.324
I think it got in through my lungs.

02:00.203 --> 02:01.788
I don't know what to do.

02:01.871 --> 02:04.749
At this point, Dale's just taking up space
in the house

02:04.833 --> 02:09.087
like a lamp that eats and smokes
and buys stuff on the Internet.

02:09.170 --> 02:11.339
I tried to convince him
to get another job, but...

02:11.422 --> 02:12.382
But nothing.

02:12.465 --> 02:15.677
-
Dale should go on a vocation vacation.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.053
A what?

02:17.137 --> 02:19.556
Aah, Peggy, whatever it is
you're talking about,

02:19.639 --> 02:22.142
it sounds like a Gribble family matter.

02:22.225 --> 02:24.102
-
I am apparently in the most coveted

02:24.269 --> 02:25.979
-advertising demographic...

02:26.062 --> 02:28.565
...because I am always finding
these opportunities

02:28.648 --> 02:30.316
under my windshield wiper.

02:30.400 --> 02:33.403
All you have to do is send Dale
on a vacation,

02:33.486 --> 02:36.656
and he'll come back with a new vocation.

02:36.739 --> 02:38.992
Unless the vacation is to a dank basement

02:39.075 --> 02:41.661
with a bunch of weird crap in it,
Dale won't go.

02:41.744 --> 02:43.204
He will if Hank makes him.

02:43.288 --> 02:45.748
I'm not going, Peggy. No way.

02:45.832 --> 02:48.251
The Gribbles are financially
treading water, Hank.

02:48.334 --> 02:51.629
And when they drown,
where do you think they're gonna come?

02:51.713 --> 02:53.923
Everyone always comes to us.

02:54.007 --> 02:57.218
Yup. You'll wake up in the morning
and there's Dale.

02:57.302 --> 02:59.554
-You'll go to the bathroom and--
-There's Dale!

02:59.637 --> 03:02.724
-You're eating breakfast and...
-And, oh, my God! There's Dale!

03:03.516 --> 03:07.353
And I have to warn you, Joseph's
going through a finding-himself phase.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.939
And it's taking him
to some pretty weird places.

03:12.692 --> 03:13.735
Fine.

03:15.278 --> 03:18.823
"Cement factory?"
Wow, they're never open to the public!

03:18.907 --> 03:21.993
And, look, I could decommission
a submarine.

03:22.076 --> 03:24.329
You know, some of these
don't sound that bad.

03:28.666 --> 03:29.500
Yup.

03:32.337 --> 03:36.174
Look out, everybody.
There's a new fat lonely sheriff in town!

03:39.093 --> 03:42.472
As a robust, balding man,
I've tried every hat there is.

03:42.555 --> 03:45.058
Fedora, newsboy, the porkpie.

03:45.141 --> 03:49.187
I know how much you hated the porkpie.
But this is the hat that's gonna stick.

03:50.146 --> 03:52.315
So, Dale, fill in the blank.

03:52.398 --> 03:55.568
"Dale and Hank are going to
spend a week working,

03:55.652 --> 04:01.449
A, in the pit crew, B, as fishing guides,
or C, as brewmasters."

04:01.532 --> 04:03.618
There really is no wrong answer.

04:03.701 --> 04:08.665
While I like the "Dale and Hank" part,
I don't like the part about learning.

04:08.748 --> 04:11.125
Come on, Dale. It could be fun.
And who knows?

04:11.209 --> 04:14.671
When you come back, you might be
able to support your family.

04:14.754 --> 04:17.465
Fine, Hank! I'll go! Geez!

04:17.548 --> 04:18.383
Give me these.

04:18.466 --> 04:21.052
I'll look them over,
make a decision, and sign us up.

04:22.178 --> 04:27.767
Come on pit crew, or fishing guide,
or brewmaster.

04:30.979 --> 04:35.566
Just remember, when you get back,
there's nothing sexier than a breadwinner.

04:35.650 --> 04:39.696
Now, let me take one last final look
at unskilled Dale.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.826
Quit being so secretive, Dale.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.327
What'd you sign us up for?

04:46.411 --> 04:48.454
Well, I was gonna wait and surprise you.

04:48.538 --> 04:52.458
But since you asked, I found something
that I've always wanted to do

04:52.542 --> 04:55.586
but never let myself believe was possible.

04:57.046 --> 04:58.589
Basket weaving.

04:59.382 --> 05:00.675
Basket weaving?

05:00.758 --> 05:01.884
What? No.

05:01.968 --> 05:04.804
I didn't even see basket weaving
in the pamphlet!

05:04.887 --> 05:07.432
It's because you weren't looking
in the arts and crafts section.

05:07.515 --> 05:08.891
Of course I wasn't.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.476
Oh, God.

05:10.560 --> 05:14.480
Just think. When I return,
I will be a full-fledged basketeer.

05:14.564 --> 05:15.982
I owe it all to you, Hank.

05:16.065 --> 05:19.819
And to a lesser and more sexual extent,
my wife.

05:19.902 --> 05:22.530
<i>♪ Oh, I love baskets ♪</i>

05:22.613 --> 05:25.241
<i>♪ Baskets, baskets, baskets ♪</i>

05:37.920 --> 05:38.921
Whoa!

05:39.005 --> 05:40.631
It's beautiful, Hank.

05:40.715 --> 05:43.593
It's like I've died and gone here.

05:43.676 --> 05:46.512
Someday, Dale, I will ask you for a favor.

05:46.596 --> 05:50.850
And I will remind you of this day
and you will do me that favor.

05:50.933 --> 05:52.977
Hello. I'm Charles.

05:53.061 --> 05:55.980
This is my wife Sharon. Vocationers.

05:56.064 --> 05:59.442
We've been innkeepers in New England,
winemakers in Napa.

05:59.525 --> 06:02.653
And most recently,
chocolateers in Hershey.

06:04.322 --> 06:07.867
But enough about Chuck and Sha-Sha
and our "vida fabuloso!"

06:07.950 --> 06:09.786
How about I introduce you to the others?

06:09.869 --> 06:12.246
That's Megan, she's Charles's daughter.

06:12.330 --> 06:13.414
Not mine though.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.083
Hi, I'm Kitty.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.835
Are you guys as excited
about weaving as me?

06:17.919 --> 06:19.879
No. But he is.

06:19.962 --> 06:24.384
Hank cares little about baskets.
He is merely a facilitator.

06:24.467 --> 06:27.011
Like a goat that keeps a racehorse calm.

06:27.095 --> 06:29.514
I am the basket-weaving racehorse.

06:29.597 --> 06:32.308
Welcome to your
Hooper Basket Factory vocation.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.851
We hope this is an experience

06:33.935 --> 06:35.061
you'll never forget.

06:35.144 --> 06:36.938
This is your itinerary.

06:37.063 --> 06:40.817
While here, you will be expected to be
on time, work your full shifts,

06:40.900 --> 06:44.112
learn and master weaves,
and meet daily quotas.

06:44.195 --> 06:45.488
Yes, I have a question.

06:45.571 --> 06:50.493
I find it interesting that pockets
were derived from baskets

06:50.576 --> 06:54.247
and were originally called pants baskets.

06:54.997 --> 06:56.499
That wasn't a question.

06:56.582 --> 06:59.460
Next on the schedule,
a tour of the facility.

06:59.544 --> 07:00.586
Follow me.

07:03.631 --> 07:08.386
This is Griffin Hooper, basket
visionary and founder of this factory.

07:08.469 --> 07:10.805
They once called me a young Hooper,

07:10.888 --> 07:14.600
until I lost my hand saving my platoon
from a grenade attack.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.144
What a waste!

07:22.108 --> 07:23.192
If you want to weave,

07:23.276 --> 07:25.862
this is where you start paying the price
in tears, sweat

07:25.945 --> 07:26.988
and fiber cuts.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.830
Vocationers, today you'll be
making a casserole basket

07:35.913 --> 07:37.540
using a summer-blossom weave.

07:37.832 --> 07:40.793
Huh! Bent-tip and needle-nose pliers.

07:40.877 --> 07:44.547
I didn't realize we'd be using
so many different tools.

07:45.715 --> 07:51.053
But of course it's not the tools that
matter but the gifted hand that weaves it.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.722
We'll see.

07:52.805 --> 07:56.392
And Mr. Gribble, we have an expression
in the basket business,

07:56.476 --> 07:58.561
"Weave it, don't say it."

07:58.644 --> 08:00.396
You have four hours.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.027
Ma'am.

08:08.321 --> 08:11.199
That right there. That why Europe hate us.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.039
Oh...

08:18.122 --> 08:20.791
Holy mackerel!
I can't believe what I just experienced!

08:20.875 --> 08:23.252
That the most amazing thing I ever seen!

08:23.336 --> 08:25.963
It was a miracle! A hat miracle!

08:26.047 --> 08:30.760
I missed the time the Wienermobile
drove by, but I saw that!

08:30.843 --> 08:33.679
Yeah, man. Like that dang old
<i>Freaky Friday</i> or something, man.

08:33.763 --> 08:36.098
We got to do this again
and videotape it for Internet!

08:36.182 --> 08:37.808
This gonna make us immortal!

08:37.892 --> 08:40.144
I've always wanted to be immortal!

08:50.488 --> 08:52.281
Gribble, present basket.

08:55.117 --> 08:57.203
This is terrible.

08:57.286 --> 08:59.288
We've had monkeys in here
who've weaved better.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.332
And by monkeys,
I mean high-school students.

09:01.415 --> 09:04.377
I appreciate
the constructive criticism, sir.

09:08.339 --> 09:12.718
Now, this is a basket.
Great weave, tight scalloping.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.929
Talk to us about your creative process.

09:15.012 --> 09:18.808
Well, I just took your materials and tools
and the time allotted,

09:18.891 --> 09:21.018
and this is what I came up with.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.437
There was nothing creative about it.

09:23.521 --> 09:27.608
You, you, you, and you have all met
the daily quotas and are now dismissed.

09:27.692 --> 09:31.862
Hank, you are dismissed
with extreme admiration.

09:32.863 --> 09:34.073
And Gribble.

09:35.616 --> 09:38.494
I just don't know what to say.

09:38.578 --> 09:43.749
You must stay until you finish
whatever you are doing there.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.089
Hank, I apologize that Brubaker...

09:50.172 --> 09:51.632
...got you so entwined

09:51.716 --> 09:54.385
in this student-teacher
passion play of ours.

09:54.468 --> 09:59.557
See, he's motivating me by withholding
praise for me and giving it to you.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.684
It's quite brilliant really.

10:02.685 --> 10:07.440
If I had a dollar for every time somebody
praised me to motivate somebody else...

10:12.528 --> 10:15.906
Hey, that was a pretty nice gust.
Why is your hat still on?

10:16.032 --> 10:18.159
Maybe your head even fatter now
than before.

10:18.242 --> 10:19.577
Maybe.

10:33.841 --> 10:35.092
Darn it!

10:35.176 --> 10:37.011
I'm never going to be Internet sensation!

10:37.094 --> 10:39.263
Oh, are you boys still at it?

10:39.347 --> 10:41.932
You are trying to capture lightning
in a bottle.

10:42.016 --> 10:43.601
Do you know how hard that is?

10:43.684 --> 10:44.727
Really hard.

10:44.810 --> 10:48.731
That is why I am going to help you.
Give me the video camera.

10:48.814 --> 10:53.319
If this turns out as well as Bobby's baby
videos, you are all gonna be stars!

10:53.402 --> 10:54.403
It's true.

10:54.487 --> 10:58.324
Her movie, <i>Bobby Learns to Crawl,</i>
inspired me to walk.

10:58.407 --> 11:01.077
Peggy Hill, we in your strong,
manly hands.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.495
Mold us!

11:03.704 --> 11:05.456
Kitty, wonderful wisteria.

11:05.539 --> 11:07.375
Charles, great lashings.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.419
Sharon, your splice is perfect.

11:16.717 --> 11:19.095
Gribble, you are done weaving.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.430
There is nothing more I can teach you.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.891
Go sweep up basket droppings.

11:23.974 --> 11:25.184
Sweep?

11:25.267 --> 11:26.852
Got you.

11:26.936 --> 11:29.939
You're breaking me so you can re-make me.

11:31.524 --> 11:32.775
Excellent.

11:32.858 --> 11:34.443
Well, it's not perfect.

11:34.527 --> 11:38.698
I wanted to have a little worm wearing
a sombrero coming out of the "O."

11:38.781 --> 11:41.492
That only took you an hour and 10 minutes!

11:41.575 --> 11:44.870
Hank, we've got a huge order to fill
from Crabtree and Evelyn.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.789
A couple of weavers aren't feeling well.

11:46.872 --> 11:50.167
You know, all these women
working together in close quarters.

11:50.251 --> 11:53.713
Things line up. Monthly things.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.423
Don't make me say it, Hank.

11:55.506 --> 11:58.384
The thing is we could use you on the line.

11:58.467 --> 11:59.760
Well, yeah, sure.

11:59.844 --> 12:00.970
If that's the assignment.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.471
Work the line?

12:02.555 --> 12:06.100
I've never seen any vocationer
called to work with the real workers.

12:06.183 --> 12:08.018
Congratulations, Hank.

12:11.731 --> 12:12.565
Huh!

12:12.940 --> 12:14.066
That's odd.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.193
Thanks for helping out, Hank.

12:16.277 --> 12:18.195
It really takes some of the pressure off.

12:18.279 --> 12:20.531
Basketweavers are second
only to postal workers

12:20.614 --> 12:22.491
in suicides and workplace assaults.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.326
Anytime I can contribute...

12:24.535 --> 12:27.204
...to a "Made in America" label,
I'm on board.

12:27.288 --> 12:31.000
You know, we're, uh, always
looking for permanent help.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.293
Permanent help?

12:32.376 --> 12:34.879
You know who'd be great for the job? Dale.

12:34.962 --> 12:38.007
He's a hard worker, loves baskets,
he'd be perfect.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.049
Yes!

12:39.133 --> 12:41.719
Sure. We'll hire Dale.

12:41.802 --> 12:44.096
You know what else
I've been meaning to do, Hank?

12:44.180 --> 12:46.015
Could you cut off my other hand?

12:46.182 --> 12:47.016
Huh!

12:47.099 --> 12:48.934
How could that be constructive criticism?

12:49.018 --> 12:51.020
He doesn't even know I'm eavesdropping.

12:51.103 --> 12:53.856
Dale'll get there. Just give him a chance.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.399
Maybe we should hire Gribble.

12:55.483 --> 12:59.528
One of our biggest customer complaints is
that our baskets aren't crappy enough.

12:59.612 --> 13:03.908
Now, come on. Dale is a very good...
Well, he...

13:05.576 --> 13:08.329
The guy can't weave. There, I said it.

13:08.412 --> 13:09.622
Hank...

13:09.705 --> 13:12.750
Yeah. I'd rather use a sack
than one of Dale's baskets.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.084
A sack!

13:53.249 --> 13:54.667
I'm sorry, Griffin.

13:54.750 --> 13:58.546
My rage was directed at you
and it should have been directed at Hank.

13:58.629 --> 14:01.507
It's Hank who's trying to destroy
my reputation.

14:01.590 --> 14:04.802
It's Hank who's standing between me
and my dream job!

14:06.178 --> 14:08.556
Yes! Yes, I see!

14:08.639 --> 14:10.975
Even in painting form, you're wise.

14:11.058 --> 14:14.186
If I want the job,
I'll have to eliminate Hank!

14:22.236 --> 14:23.696
Take that!

14:23.779 --> 14:26.156
-And that!
-Hey, what the...

14:26.240 --> 14:28.659
Double-crossing, basket-weaving...

14:30.786 --> 14:32.454
What the hell, Dale?

14:49.555 --> 14:50.389
Dale?

14:54.810 --> 14:56.812
What the heck are you doing, Dale?

14:56.896 --> 14:58.814
I'm trying to kill you!

14:58.898 --> 15:00.441
Kill me? Why?

15:00.524 --> 15:02.693
How about because
you were making fun of me?

15:02.776 --> 15:06.614
How about because there's a job opening
and if I eliminate you, it would be mine!

15:06.697 --> 15:08.616
What? That's crazy.

15:08.699 --> 15:11.285
Oh, so you weren't mocking me?

15:12.369 --> 15:13.954
I shouldn't have done that, Dale.

15:14.038 --> 15:18.292
I just got caught up with what everyone
was saying because it was so true.

15:18.375 --> 15:20.085
You're supposed to be my friend, Hank.

15:20.169 --> 15:23.881
But when I opened the door, you slithered
right in and took what's mine.

15:23.964 --> 15:26.008
I don't even want the job, Dale.

15:26.091 --> 15:27.343
And I hate to tell you this.

15:27.426 --> 15:31.055
But even if you had killed me,
you still wouldn't have gotten the job.

15:34.892 --> 15:38.145
-What if I also killed Charles and Sharon?
-No.

15:38.228 --> 15:40.814
And then killed Kitty.
Would I get the job then?

15:42.399 --> 15:44.568
But that only leaves Megan.

15:44.652 --> 15:45.778
Megan?

15:45.861 --> 15:47.696
Megan's better than me?

15:50.699 --> 15:53.035
I was supposed to come here
and learn a new skill

15:53.118 --> 15:55.704
that I could use
to help support my family.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.374
I was gonna be a basket maker.

15:58.457 --> 15:59.625
I'm a failure.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.719
Remember when we used to watch TV on TV?

16:10.803 --> 16:12.471
This is so much cooler!

16:12.554 --> 16:13.973
So here it is!

16:14.056 --> 16:18.060
Peggy Hill presents
<i>Bill's Hat Flies Onto Kahn's Head!</i>

16:38.122 --> 16:39.415
That's terrible!

16:39.498 --> 16:43.043
Well, we add filmmaking to the list
of things Peggy Hill can't do!

16:43.127 --> 16:45.713
Right after cooking
and wearing open-toed shoes!

16:45.796 --> 16:49.258
I never thought I'd say this
but I'm a little embarrassed.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.555
Look! Someone else watched it!

16:54.638 --> 16:57.725
Hey! Hey, four hits! I think we're viral!

17:00.102 --> 17:02.438
Now we wait for the parodies.

17:04.690 --> 17:07.943
Uh, Mr. Brubaker,
I just wanted to turn in our tools.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.820
Dale and I are leaving early.

17:09.903 --> 17:13.365
Hank, you can't leave!
There's still baskets to be made!

17:13.991 --> 17:16.160
There are always baskets to be made.

17:16.243 --> 17:17.703
Look, I only came here

17:17.786 --> 17:19.121
to support my friend.

17:19.204 --> 17:22.082
And he just tried to kill me
with a forklift.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.543
Not everyone has the gift of weaving.

17:24.626 --> 17:27.963
It would be a tragedy for a person
with your talent to stop weaving.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.883
Just as it would be a tragedy
for Gribble to continue.

17:30.966 --> 17:33.719
Well, if there were some way
to give Dale his dignity back,

17:33.802 --> 17:35.637
I would gladly stay and help out.

17:35.721 --> 17:38.515
What if I found something
for Gribble to do?

17:38.599 --> 17:41.393
Can he organize the Secret Santa?
I hate doing that.

17:41.477 --> 17:44.646
The closest thing he's ever been good at
is killing bugs.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.815
Well, we don't need an exterminator.

17:46.899 --> 17:50.486
Ever since we lost the entire Spring '87
line to the bamboo-boring beetle,

17:50.569 --> 17:53.238
we've been spraying
with the highest grade poisons allowed.

17:53.322 --> 17:56.366
Which reminds me, you should take
your 15-minute breaks outside

17:56.450 --> 17:57.743
as much as possible.

18:00.204 --> 18:01.914
What if the beetles came back?

18:06.502 --> 18:10.005
So, uh, you say you got
a tainted shipment of wicker?

18:10.089 --> 18:12.633
Yes. It's crawling
with the bamboo-boring beetle.

18:12.716 --> 18:14.551
If we don't get this taken care of,

18:14.635 --> 18:17.179
we'll have
the biggest basket shortage since...

18:18.138 --> 18:20.349
wicker was needed for the war effort?

18:21.975 --> 18:26.105
That darn beetle took my Easter basket
when I was a kid!

18:26.188 --> 18:30.150
It knows no mercy.
I had to put my eggs in a shoe.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.694
Well, Dale,
you're the only exterminator here.

18:32.778 --> 18:37.157
Don't you want to save the baskets
you love so much for some reason?

18:37.241 --> 18:39.284
I'm gonna take on the beetles!

18:39.368 --> 18:41.328
And this time,
I'm not gonna use a forklift!

18:41.411 --> 18:43.997
I'm gonna use poison
like I should have done with Hank!

18:44.081 --> 18:45.332
Let's go!

18:50.087 --> 18:51.630
Attention, weavers!

18:51.713 --> 18:55.425
Put your tools down
and step away from your baskets!

18:56.093 --> 19:00.013
This factory has been infestated by
the voracious bamboo-boring beetle!

19:00.097 --> 19:01.723
Please do not panic.

19:01.807 --> 19:02.975
Oh, my!

19:03.058 --> 19:03.892
Oh, my God!

19:03.976 --> 19:06.061
This is cigar rolling all over again.

19:06.145 --> 19:09.523
But don't worry.
Dale is a professional exterminator.

19:09.606 --> 19:11.358
He's gonna take care of everything.

19:14.403 --> 19:16.530
I see... I see...

19:16.613 --> 19:20.325
I can't see them. Thank God!
They're still in their larvae state.

19:20.409 --> 19:21.451
There's still time.

19:21.535 --> 19:23.453
We're gonna have to burn them out.

19:23.537 --> 19:26.373
I haven't felt this safe since my divorce.

19:26.456 --> 19:28.000
You didn't say anything about fire.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.418
It'll be fine.

19:29.501 --> 19:32.421
If not, I'll weave
the entire spring line for you.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.801
First, we need some baskets
to use as bait.

19:37.885 --> 19:40.262
You two, pile some in that corner.

19:40.345 --> 19:41.763
Use mine because they suck.

19:49.229 --> 19:53.358
Now everybody stand back
and cover your two favorite orifices.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.570
This'll cut off their escape route.

20:01.408 --> 20:02.993
We got them cornered.

20:03.076 --> 20:04.161
Time to assassinate.

20:04.244 --> 20:08.415
Women and small men, look away!
You do not want my nightmares!

20:15.631 --> 20:16.965
<i>Adieu.</i>

20:17.049 --> 20:19.176
Way to go! Yeah!

20:19.259 --> 20:20.177
Nice job.

20:20.260 --> 20:22.930
Thank you, Dale. You've saved the factory.

20:23.013 --> 20:26.808
As a token of my appreciation,
I present you with the...

20:27.059 --> 20:28.518
uh...

20:30.270 --> 20:31.730
Basket of honor.

20:33.398 --> 20:34.983
Wow, that was cool!

20:35.067 --> 20:38.278
You get to kill all the time
and, like, it's legal?

20:38.362 --> 20:40.781
You wear a jumpsuit to work every day?

20:40.906 --> 20:43.825
Ooh. Imagine the time
I'd save in the morning.

20:43.909 --> 20:48.956
An exterminator is like a garbage man
crossed with a scientist.

20:49.039 --> 20:51.041
The best of both worlds.

20:51.124 --> 20:53.710
I'd be interested to hear more about it.

20:53.794 --> 20:56.630
Really? How interested?

21:04.846 --> 21:09.059
On this vocation vacation,
you will learn a lot about bugs,

21:09.142 --> 21:10.644
a lot about poisons.

21:10.727 --> 21:13.981
But most of all, a lot about killing.

21:54.730 --> 21:57.566
