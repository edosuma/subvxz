WEBVTT

01:06.748 --> 01:08.512
Who is he?

01:11.319 --> 01:15.313
Tell him who you are.

01:20.295 --> 01:27.759
My name
is Nikita Alexsandr Reznikov.

01:31.606 --> 01:33.233
I am your father.

02:10.245 --> 02:12.009
- Come on, G. Come on.
- Deeks, come on.

02:12.180 --> 02:15.172
- Reach up. You got this. Reach up.
- You can do it. Dig deep. Come on.

02:15.350 --> 02:18.251
Yes, yes, yes. Come on.
Come on, almost there.

02:18.419 --> 02:20.581
- Gotcha.
- Yes!

02:20.755 --> 02:22.416
- King of the mountain!
- Yes!

02:22.590 --> 02:24.183
Heh. Best of five, Deeks.

02:24.359 --> 02:25.383
You're on.

02:25.560 --> 02:26.618
I love it!

02:31.833 --> 02:35.736
Sam, maybe you haven't noticed,
but he's beaten me twice in a row.

02:35.903 --> 02:37.234
Which means he's getting tired.

02:37.405 --> 02:38.895
Which means you can beat him.

02:39.073 --> 02:42.134
He has a longer reach than I do.
He climbs like an orangutan.

02:42.310 --> 02:44.039
Hey, then let's show
this monkey boy, G.

02:44.212 --> 02:45.441
Hey. Seriously?

02:48.283 --> 02:49.478
Okay, let's come down.

02:50.118 --> 02:51.711
- Best of five.
- Unh.

02:51.886 --> 02:53.877
- You can do it.
- Best of five.

02:54.856 --> 02:58.815
So he has bounced back.
Clean bill of health.

02:59.193 --> 03:01.423
Unless I'm missing something.

03:02.397 --> 03:04.764
I wouldn't have encouraged him back
on the bike

03:04.932 --> 03:06.798
if didn't think he could ride it.

03:07.802 --> 03:09.827
And what about Kensi?

03:10.004 --> 03:13.406
Partnerships are tricky
at the best of times.

03:14.676 --> 03:16.474
You're worried about both of them.

03:17.111 --> 03:20.672
Well, I always worry
about somebody, Owen.

03:24.252 --> 03:26.414
You're whistling in the wind,
Mr. Beale.

03:26.587 --> 03:29.249
- They're not here.
- But both of you are.

03:29.757 --> 03:32.783
I think you need to see this,
before anyone else.

03:38.499 --> 03:40.490
This better be good, Eric.

03:40.935 --> 03:42.767
It's not good.

03:43.538 --> 03:46.303
It's... It's bad.

03:46.474 --> 03:47.703
It's all bad.

03:47.875 --> 03:49.468
L.A.P.D. just sent it through.

03:57.385 --> 04:00.150
Oh. Bugger.

04:00.321 --> 04:01.516
- Hold on!
- Come on!

04:01.689 --> 04:03.783
What are you thinking? Reach up!

04:03.958 --> 04:05.187
He's tired. He's ti...

04:05.360 --> 04:09.160
Ah, yes! Two all. Heh.

04:09.330 --> 04:10.530
Told you he was getting tired.

04:10.698 --> 04:12.393
Deeks, why did you let him
win again?

04:12.567 --> 04:13.966
He did not let him win, Kens.

04:14.135 --> 04:16.728
He's just dealing with an opponent
who's much more agile.

04:16.904 --> 04:18.531
I'm sorry. Agile?

04:18.706 --> 04:21.505
My guy let your guy win
to make it a contest.

04:21.676 --> 04:23.201
Heh. Oh, you want a contest?

04:24.045 --> 04:27.174
- Yeah, actually, uh, I'm done.
- Heh, heh.

04:27.348 --> 04:29.214
- Me too.
- Wait. What?

04:29.384 --> 04:31.216
- You're quitting?
- While I'm ahead.

04:32.053 --> 04:34.078
But you're not ahead. It's a tie.

04:35.056 --> 04:39.584
No one loses
when the game's a draw, Mr. Hanna.

04:39.761 --> 04:42.822
Ops center, everyone.
Eric has business.

04:43.664 --> 04:45.189
We're not done.

04:45.366 --> 04:46.697
Not you, Mr. Callen.

04:46.868 --> 04:48.962
- For you, a field trip.
- Oh, we're not done.

04:49.137 --> 04:51.071
Camp Pendleton.

04:52.173 --> 04:56.041
"Agent assessment"? But isn't that
always done out of Washington?

04:56.644 --> 05:00.877
Hmm, normally, but you can't climb
Mount Everest every day.

05:01.649 --> 05:03.947
Have that on my desk
by the end of the week.

05:04.585 --> 05:06.383
Enjoy the drive.

05:14.896 --> 05:17.524
You can start, please, Eric.

05:17.932 --> 05:20.560
Early this morning,
police responded to a report

05:20.735 --> 05:22.965
of shots fired
in this West Hollywood house.

05:23.137 --> 05:24.468
There were signs of forced entry.

05:24.639 --> 05:27.404
When they entered,
this is what they found.

05:29.043 --> 05:31.637
The living room
had been pretty much shot up.

05:31.813 --> 05:33.872
A severed finger was found
on the floor

05:34.048 --> 05:36.039
and used to write this message
on the wall.

05:38.352 --> 05:39.615
Where is he?

05:39.787 --> 05:42.279
I sent him on assignment
to Camp Pendleton.

05:42.790 --> 05:46.954
This is strictly
a need-to-know operation

05:47.128 --> 05:50.962
for which Mr. Callen is not cleared.

05:51.132 --> 05:52.293
Understood?

05:52.467 --> 05:55.129
Ms. Blye, Mr. Deeks,
work with Nell and Eric.

05:55.303 --> 05:57.601
I wanna know everything
about that house

05:57.772 --> 05:59.262
and the people who live there.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.738
Sam, crime scene.

06:01.909 --> 06:03.468
We always work with a partner,
Hetty.

06:07.181 --> 06:08.649
I'll drive.

06:16.090 --> 06:18.616
- You headed out?
- Yeah.

06:25.466 --> 06:27.628
See you when you get back, G.

06:45.386 --> 06:47.286
Sensitive brakes.

07:06.541 --> 07:08.373
Well, they turned it
into a shooting gallery.

07:08.543 --> 07:09.806
Thirty, 40 rounds.

07:09.977 --> 07:12.002
Like they wanted to make sure
the neighbors heard.

07:12.179 --> 07:13.305
Anyone see anything?

07:13.481 --> 07:15.848
Couple people saw a van leaving,
no lights.

07:18.819 --> 07:20.810
Agent Callen,
you are not authorized for...

07:20.988 --> 07:22.922
Agent Callen.

08:04.264 --> 08:09.168
It appears you got lost on your
way to Camp Pendleton, Mr. Callen.

08:13.339 --> 08:15.239
Someone gave me wrong directions.

08:23.917 --> 08:25.612
Is that him?

08:27.453 --> 08:29.148
Could be.

08:30.824 --> 08:33.350
He doesn't really look like me.

08:35.828 --> 08:37.193
Maybe in the eyes.

08:41.034 --> 08:44.163
Anybody find anything
to prove it's true?

08:44.938 --> 08:49.034
No, not yet.
We've been collecting DNA.

08:49.475 --> 08:53.776
It'll take a few days
to test against your sample.

08:58.318 --> 09:01.379
His name is Michael Reinhardt.

09:02.188 --> 09:07.126
He emigrated from Germany
in 1979.

09:07.493 --> 09:10.895
Bought this place in '81.
He was a bookkeeper.

09:11.064 --> 09:13.658
Worked mostly for small companies.

09:13.833 --> 09:17.201
Mostly in the garment industry.

09:17.370 --> 09:19.304
Does that sound like my father
to you?

09:20.340 --> 09:23.901
Clearly someone believes it's him.

09:34.120 --> 09:38.318
You can't take an active role
in this investigation, Mr. Callen.

09:38.491 --> 09:44.328
I'm going to have to stand you down
until things are clearer.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.005
Mr. Callen?

09:59.045 --> 10:01.673
Do you recognize someone?

10:06.085 --> 10:07.450
Me.

10:12.959 --> 10:14.825
Which photo?

10:18.131 --> 10:19.462
All of them.

10:27.473 --> 10:32.070
Okay, so we've got traffic cameras
in a four-block radius of the house,

10:32.245 --> 10:35.613
and the first 911 call came through
at 5:23 this morning.

10:35.782 --> 10:40.310
All right, resetting to search at 5:23
at two times the speed.

10:42.088 --> 10:44.489
Light traffic at that time of morning.

10:44.657 --> 10:46.250
So specific time

10:46.426 --> 10:48.622
plus close proximity
of multiple traffic cams

10:48.795 --> 10:51.287
- plus X equals gotcha.
- X being?

10:51.464 --> 10:53.660
The need to get away
from the scene of the crime.

10:53.833 --> 10:55.358
Panic. Fear.

10:55.535 --> 10:57.731
Like a speeding van
running a red light.

10:57.904 --> 10:58.962
Yeah, something like that.

10:59.138 --> 11:01.573
No, I just saw a speeding van
run a red light.

11:01.741 --> 11:05.177
Uh, the Rosewood Avenue cameras.
Can you scroll back?

11:05.345 --> 11:06.744
Yeah.

11:07.480 --> 11:09.949
License-plate scan.

11:12.352 --> 11:14.252
Reported stolen last night.

11:14.420 --> 11:16.184
Equals gotcha.

11:21.995 --> 11:23.156
1980.

11:23.329 --> 11:24.592
I was 10 years old.

11:24.764 --> 11:26.493
Bakersfield.

11:28.401 --> 11:30.460
Oh, yeah, the McPhersons.

11:30.636 --> 11:35.130
They had a trucking company.
They were my tenth foster house.

11:35.308 --> 11:36.776
How long did you live there for?

11:38.244 --> 11:40.235
Just a few weeks.

11:42.448 --> 11:43.643
I actually liked her.

11:44.183 --> 11:46.709
I used to help her
with her gardening. Heh.

11:46.886 --> 11:48.718
What about him?

11:48.888 --> 11:50.913
Not so much.

11:51.391 --> 11:53.485
Used to beat me
with a broom handle.

11:56.329 --> 11:57.888
Is that why they moved you?

11:58.931 --> 12:02.060
They moved me because one day I
took the broom handle out of his hand

12:02.235 --> 12:03.703
and I broke it over his head.

12:05.538 --> 12:06.801
All right.

12:07.774 --> 12:10.072
Anyway, most of these were taken
with a telephoto lens.

12:10.243 --> 12:12.439
Some are better than others.

12:14.147 --> 12:16.912
Wow, I got 8 mm film.

12:22.922 --> 12:26.483
"Los Angeles, 2010."
Most recent one yet.

12:42.475 --> 12:43.567
The car.

12:45.812 --> 12:47.075
What car?

12:47.914 --> 12:50.281
I saw the guy
that took this photo of me.

12:51.250 --> 12:55.653
I chased him, he got in a car,
and he took off. But there was...

12:57.190 --> 12:59.215
There was a man in the backseat.

13:01.627 --> 13:03.425
I think it was him.

13:04.697 --> 13:07.064
Okay, so the owner
reported the van stolen

13:07.233 --> 13:09.258
from this parking lot on Lincoln
in Santa Monica

13:09.435 --> 13:11.927
between 5:15 and 6 p.m. yesterday.

13:12.105 --> 13:15.598
Two security cams, both wide.

13:17.143 --> 13:18.474
That's our van.

13:18.644 --> 13:21.944
And that's our man.
Can you zoom in?

13:24.584 --> 13:27.076
Low-resolution camera.
That's as good as it gets.

13:27.253 --> 13:30.484
Uh, roll it back.
See where they came from.

13:34.727 --> 13:36.627
They came by taxi.

13:43.603 --> 13:46.095
- Did you find anything at the house?
- Nothing.

13:46.272 --> 13:48.468
Just a bunch of spent shell casings.

13:48.641 --> 13:49.938
Nine millimeter.

13:50.109 --> 13:52.100
My money's on an Uzi.

13:56.849 --> 13:57.975
You think it's him?

14:01.187 --> 14:04.020
All the photos
and the personal things.

14:04.757 --> 14:07.192
Who else would have done this
for all these years?

14:07.360 --> 14:09.124
These decades?

14:12.798 --> 14:14.926
It's the only thing
that makes any sense, but...

14:23.943 --> 14:25.843
Why wouldn't he just contact me?

14:27.213 --> 14:30.945
Yeah, well, someone's
gonna contact you now.

14:32.652 --> 14:34.450
Apparently so.

14:34.620 --> 14:36.281
How?

14:37.690 --> 14:39.351
How do they contact you?

14:39.525 --> 14:42.961
I mean, like,
how do they even get started?

14:44.897 --> 14:48.458
If they can find him,
they can find me.

14:48.968 --> 14:50.608
But this place
has never been compromised,

14:50.770 --> 14:52.210
your house is listed under an alias,

14:52.371 --> 14:54.999
and, what, maybe there's six people
on the entire planet

14:55.174 --> 14:56.664
that have your phone number?

14:56.842 --> 14:59.812
Of which three are in this room
with you.

14:59.979 --> 15:04.644
Yeah, well, whoever did this
already figured out their next move.

15:04.817 --> 15:07.445
The question is, who are they?

15:08.354 --> 15:10.152
A long way from Romania.

15:10.323 --> 15:12.758
Heh. Didn't we bury most of them?

15:13.559 --> 15:14.856
Most of them.

15:15.027 --> 15:17.325
That's a bunch of random people.

15:17.496 --> 15:19.931
Some of Reinhardt.
Different places, different years.

15:20.099 --> 15:22.397
None of them are you.

15:32.645 --> 15:33.669
Found something?

15:35.147 --> 15:37.241
No, just more ghosts.

15:40.953 --> 15:43.820
All right. Thanks, Stevie.
I owe you bigtime. It's on its way.

15:43.990 --> 15:45.651
Is any of this actually legal?

15:45.825 --> 15:48.055
- All of it.
- Good.

15:48.694 --> 15:51.561
All right, let's take a look
at our two friends.

15:53.866 --> 15:55.834
- Is that...?
- Yeah.

15:56.836 --> 15:58.429
That's him.

15:59.205 --> 16:01.173
We tried, Owen.

16:01.340 --> 16:06.141
And he saw right through the little ruse
before he ever left the parking garage.

16:06.312 --> 16:09.111
Then stand him down, Henrietta.
Send him home.

16:09.282 --> 16:11.148
He cannot work this case.

16:11.317 --> 16:14.082
He is this case, Owen.

16:14.253 --> 16:15.516
This is his case

16:15.688 --> 16:20.717
since the first time he asked someone
who his parents were.

16:21.360 --> 16:23.795
For now, and for the record,

16:23.963 --> 16:27.331
he's our witness,
helping us to identify evidence.

16:27.833 --> 16:30.803
And if we have to go tactical?
What is he then?

16:30.970 --> 16:32.267
Excuse me, Hetty.

16:33.539 --> 16:36.133
We've got a name.
We've tied him to the van

16:36.309 --> 16:38.869
that we're pretty certain was used
to abduct Reinhardt.

16:39.045 --> 16:41.810
The van was stolen from Santa Monica
by two men

16:41.981 --> 16:43.881
who were dropped off
at the parking lot by taxi.

16:44.050 --> 16:46.348
A friend at the taxi company
located the cab

16:46.519 --> 16:49.580
and pulled a screen grab
from the taxi security camera.

16:50.323 --> 16:51.688
There was no pickup address.

16:51.857 --> 16:53.757
They hailed the cab
from a street downtown.

16:54.860 --> 16:56.624
Now it's starting to make sense.

16:56.796 --> 16:57.957
What do we have?

16:58.664 --> 17:00.689
Put it on the monitor, Eric.

17:09.775 --> 17:11.800
Vasile Comescu.

17:14.646 --> 17:16.705
Now we know who.

17:17.583 --> 17:19.550
And we know why.

17:30.462 --> 17:32.396
According to ICE,
Vasile entered the country

17:32.564 --> 17:34.259
five days ago.
He came through New York.

17:34.432 --> 17:36.560
You don't organize something like this
in five days.

17:36.735 --> 17:39.170
They have to have had people
on the ground setting this up.

17:39.337 --> 17:42.705
Well, the Comescu family was heavily
involved in human trafficking.

17:42.874 --> 17:44.899
In and out of Europe
and the Middle East mostly,

17:45.076 --> 17:46.874
but you don't build a network
like that

17:47.045 --> 17:48.672
without having contacts everywhere,

17:48.847 --> 17:51.043
- including here.
- How many left?

17:52.984 --> 17:54.008
Comescus?

17:54.419 --> 17:56.786
Um, according to the intel
we gathered in Romania

17:56.955 --> 17:59.686
after we rescued Hetty, not many.

17:59.858 --> 18:03.385
Vasile and Dracul both survived.
Dracul was killed in Hawaii last year.

18:03.962 --> 18:07.364
Does Vasile know that Callen's the one
that killed his brother?

18:07.532 --> 18:09.330
Yeah, he knows.

18:09.501 --> 18:10.701
Which makes Callen the target.

18:10.869 --> 18:13.531
That's why they killed his mother
and his grandfather.

18:13.705 --> 18:15.036
That's the bloodline.

18:15.206 --> 18:17.470
If Reinhardt really is Callen's father,

18:17.642 --> 18:19.633
he is nothing more
than a bargaining chip

18:19.811 --> 18:21.404
for what Vasile wants most.

18:21.579 --> 18:25.243
- Callen's head.
- Eric, find Mr. Callen for me.

18:25.417 --> 18:27.511
I thought he was with you.

18:28.052 --> 18:29.884
Ah, Mr. Hanna.

18:30.054 --> 18:31.351
I didn't see him leave.

18:34.559 --> 18:37.290
- Eric.
- Calling now.

18:39.063 --> 18:40.394
His phone's turned off.

18:40.565 --> 18:42.624
GPS?

18:42.801 --> 18:44.200
Also turned off.

18:44.369 --> 18:45.768
His car?

18:46.371 --> 18:47.532
No signal.

18:48.139 --> 18:49.573
Okay.

18:49.741 --> 18:53.041
He knows something.
He knows someone.

18:53.211 --> 18:55.873
Start at his house. Find him.

18:56.581 --> 19:00.540
Bring him back here,
in handcuffs if necessary.

19:06.791 --> 19:09.158
- Challenger?
- Car pool.

19:09.327 --> 19:12.592
Challenger's having her brakes
looked at. Sensitive.

19:14.833 --> 19:16.665
- It's all yours.
- Right.

19:17.836 --> 19:21.272
Eric, find that van
before Mr. Callen does.

19:23.107 --> 19:24.131
Fine, fine. You do that.

19:24.309 --> 19:26.403
And when you come back to me
to complain about them,

19:26.578 --> 19:28.342
remember what I told you.

19:28.513 --> 19:31.448
I know, I know. It's just business.

19:31.616 --> 19:34.210
But when you come back to me,
price is double.

19:34.385 --> 19:36.877
Yes, it's just business.

19:39.257 --> 19:40.952
Ass.

19:47.098 --> 19:49.192
I should tell you,
I'm having a bad day.

19:49.367 --> 19:51.335
Come out slowly.

19:55.974 --> 19:57.533
You trying to get yourself killed?

19:58.576 --> 19:59.702
Not with that gun.

19:59.878 --> 20:02.210
Now you leave me defenseless
against my enemies.

20:02.380 --> 20:05.680
- Who leaves a gun in the fridge?
- We all do.

20:06.518 --> 20:07.815
How did you get in?

20:07.986 --> 20:09.750
Parked in the back alley,
jumped the fence.

20:09.921 --> 20:12.856
You've got a security-camera
blind spot by your pool.

20:14.559 --> 20:16.152
Thanks for finding it.

20:19.430 --> 20:21.398
That bring back some memories?

20:24.002 --> 20:26.733
I'm more handsome now. Richer.

20:26.905 --> 20:28.669
Who is the guy next to you?

20:28.840 --> 20:30.467
Could be anyone.

20:30.642 --> 20:32.804
- Name's Michael Reinhardt.
- I don't know him.

20:32.977 --> 20:34.536
Maybe you know him
by a different name.

20:37.048 --> 20:38.846
Ask the real question.

20:39.450 --> 20:41.509
The one you came to ask me.

20:47.292 --> 20:48.760
Is this my father?

20:50.762 --> 20:54.665
No one has ever introduced
themselves to me as your father.

20:54.832 --> 20:58.860
So maybe he is, maybe he isn't.

21:00.104 --> 21:01.833
Well, someone thinks he is.

21:04.108 --> 21:05.166
Do you?

21:09.247 --> 21:12.706
Someone is trying to get to me
through him.

21:13.651 --> 21:15.278
Vasile Comescu.

21:19.023 --> 21:21.287
I know Comescus.

21:21.459 --> 21:23.291
Romany.

21:23.461 --> 21:25.361
Human trafficking, arms smuggling.

21:25.530 --> 21:30.127
If anyone could find your father,
it would be them.

21:30.668 --> 21:33.103
I heard they had family tragedy
couple of years ago.

21:33.271 --> 21:36.241
Many died,
including head of Comescu family.

21:39.711 --> 21:41.236
Is this business?

21:43.014 --> 21:44.311
This is personal.

21:46.017 --> 21:48.384
Nice knowing you, Callen.

21:55.059 --> 21:57.153
You just sent me text message.

21:57.328 --> 21:59.888
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did.

22:01.366 --> 22:05.234
"Come to my house.
Urgent. Callen.”

22:07.038 --> 22:09.166
They're watching your house.

22:10.775 --> 22:12.504
They send you the message.

22:12.677 --> 22:15.476
You leave,
they follow you back to my house,

22:15.647 --> 22:17.115
wait for me to come home.

22:18.683 --> 22:20.344
What are you going to do?

22:22.120 --> 22:23.918
Well, we don't wanna
disappoint them.

22:24.088 --> 22:25.487
What means "we"?

22:25.657 --> 22:29.855
They're gonna expect to see you
and maybe a driver.

22:30.028 --> 22:31.291
Do I owe you favor?

22:31.996 --> 22:33.464
No.

22:33.831 --> 22:37.324
But when this is done,
I'm gonna owe you one.

22:38.369 --> 22:39.734
Then it is business.

22:42.240 --> 22:44.334
Ay-yai.

22:45.209 --> 22:47.439
Gun is still cold.

23:01.125 --> 23:03.025
My brother-in-law's car.

23:04.262 --> 23:08.221
- It may get a little rough.
- Is okay. I don't like him anyway.

23:12.070 --> 23:13.504
Make sure you use indicators.

23:14.772 --> 23:16.706
You don't want to get pulled over,
do you?

23:16.874 --> 23:19.536
- What, you got a body in the trunk?
- No.

23:20.178 --> 23:21.839
Not today.

23:27.785 --> 23:29.685
There they are.

23:30.321 --> 23:31.345
You got a plan?

23:32.256 --> 23:34.247
- Yeah.
- What is it?

23:35.827 --> 23:37.261
Watch.

23:49.941 --> 23:51.466
Damn.

23:58.583 --> 24:00.574
Good plan.

24:06.958 --> 24:08.357
Anton Comescu.

24:09.560 --> 24:10.721
They're already dead.

24:13.264 --> 24:14.993
Old habit.

24:15.166 --> 24:16.531
Who's going to pay for this?

24:17.802 --> 24:19.497
Your brother-in-law has insurance,
right?

24:19.670 --> 24:21.035
Yeah.

24:21.372 --> 24:24.069
Well, his premiums are gonna go up.

24:24.242 --> 24:25.368
Open the trunk.

24:26.144 --> 24:27.612
That's good.

24:27.779 --> 24:29.440
Give me your phone.

24:30.281 --> 24:31.749
Come on.

24:34.752 --> 24:36.277
- This is Eric.
- Eric.

24:36.454 --> 24:38.786
I'm at Primrose just south of 3rd.
Send someone over here.

24:38.956 --> 24:41.118
I got two bodies down
and Arkady Kolcheck needs a ride.

24:41.292 --> 24:43.056
All right, Callen,
but Hetty needs to talk...

24:44.428 --> 24:46.157
- Give me your gun.
- Sure.

24:47.732 --> 24:49.325
Is he your father?

24:50.268 --> 24:51.929
We're about to find out.

24:56.307 --> 24:58.298
Or die trying.

25:14.691 --> 25:17.490
- Sit down.
- No. After you.

25:18.728 --> 25:22.631
Okey-dokey-dokey-dokey.
No niceties today.

25:23.600 --> 25:26.570
- Where's Callen?
- I don't know.

25:26.736 --> 25:29.467
Okay, we found you beside a car

25:29.639 --> 25:32.074
with two men
who'd been shot to death.

25:32.242 --> 25:34.074
And we swabbed you
for gun residue.

25:34.244 --> 25:36.770
And when that's processed,
what do you think we're gonna find?

25:36.946 --> 25:38.311
That I fired weapon.

25:38.848 --> 25:40.338
Self-defense.

25:40.884 --> 25:42.784
Agent Callen
will tell you same thing.

25:42.952 --> 25:45.046
Well, then you better hope
we find him alive, pal.

25:45.221 --> 25:47.155
He's the only friend
that's gonna vouch for you.

25:47.323 --> 25:49.291
I don't know where he is.

25:49.459 --> 25:51.291
I know what he went to do.

25:51.461 --> 25:55.091
And I can truthfully say
I don't know where he went to do it.

25:55.899 --> 25:57.094
Why wait with the bodies?

25:57.267 --> 25:59.347
You could've been long gone
by the time we got there.

25:59.502 --> 26:01.903
Because I wanted you to know
what happened,

26:02.072 --> 26:04.040
what Callen was going to do.

26:04.507 --> 26:05.531
Why?

26:10.280 --> 26:15.616
Because Callen is a friend of mine,
and I don't want him to die today.

26:21.858 --> 26:23.849
Battery's missing.

26:26.229 --> 26:29.460
Cheap rental, no nav.

26:31.734 --> 26:35.728
Now, Arkady said
Callen took Anton's cell phone.

26:44.981 --> 26:46.779
Left one for us.

26:50.220 --> 26:51.585
- Hey, Sam.
- Eric.

26:51.754 --> 26:53.434
- What's up?
- I got a cell number for you.

26:53.590 --> 26:54.682
It's probably a burn phone.

26:54.858 --> 26:58.488
Number's 310-555-0116.

26:58.661 --> 27:00.288
- Recent calls?
- One.

27:00.463 --> 27:04.366
310-555-0122.

27:06.169 --> 27:07.500
Numbers are almost sequential.

27:07.670 --> 27:10.105
They probably bought them
at the same time at the same store.

27:10.273 --> 27:12.264
Store's gonna have records
even for burn phones.

27:12.442 --> 27:13.500
Got it.

27:13.943 --> 27:16.605
Why would he take the battery,
Sam?

27:17.313 --> 27:19.782
I can think of a couple of reasons.

27:20.350 --> 27:22.011
None of them good.

28:27.283 --> 28:28.307
Anton.

28:30.186 --> 28:31.654
Yeah, he found me.

28:32.622 --> 28:35.057
But he's not able to make it
to the phone right now.

28:36.359 --> 28:39.158
Your family's getting smaller, Vasile.

28:39.329 --> 28:40.990
How many cousins you have left,

28:42.432 --> 28:43.593
Let me talk to him.

28:44.100 --> 28:48.037
I have someone you want,
and you have someone I want.

28:48.204 --> 28:49.831
I need to know that he's alive.

28:50.006 --> 28:51.030
You'll know when we meet.

28:52.775 --> 28:56.507
No exchange until I know he's alive.

28:56.679 --> 29:00.445
How about I just shoot him and you
send another cousin to come find me?

29:19.335 --> 29:21.463
Did you run out of cousins, Vasile?

29:21.638 --> 29:23.106
South Central and Sth.

29:23.273 --> 29:25.264
Call me when you are there.

29:37.587 --> 29:40.079
I just got a hit on the number
Sam gave me.

29:41.524 --> 29:43.014
Cell tower in the Garment District.

29:43.192 --> 29:45.923
Two calls, several seconds apart,
same tower.

29:46.095 --> 29:48.215
Means whoever's using the phone
probably isn't moving.

29:48.364 --> 29:49.763
Get Kensi and Deeks.

29:49.932 --> 29:51.229
- I'm calling Sam.
- Yeah.

29:53.136 --> 29:55.070
Thank you, Robert.

30:05.882 --> 30:07.316
Arkady.

30:07.483 --> 30:09.144
Henrietta.

30:09.319 --> 30:11.413
So, what have you got
to trade today?

30:11.988 --> 30:15.288
I never said I had anything to trade,
Henrietta. Ha, ha.

30:15.458 --> 30:19.827
But you always do,
even when you say you don't.

30:19.996 --> 30:22.966
Hmm. What makes you think I do?

30:25.134 --> 30:26.966
Callen came to see you.

30:28.171 --> 30:30.970
If I did have something,
you shouldn't assume

30:31.140 --> 30:34.007
that it would make any difference
right now.

30:34.777 --> 30:36.745
It wouldn't help me find him?

30:36.913 --> 30:38.244
No.

30:39.649 --> 30:44.018
But it might help him find himself?

30:45.021 --> 30:46.682
Maybe.

30:46.856 --> 30:50.724
And what would you want in return?

30:52.161 --> 30:55.461
Perhaps a consideration
in the future.

30:56.833 --> 30:58.995
When I might need one.

30:59.902 --> 31:01.165
Go on.

31:02.739 --> 31:05.709
I know Michael Reinhardt.

31:22.091 --> 31:25.220
- Yes.
- I'm at South Central and Sth.

31:25.395 --> 31:27.329
Drive east for two blocks, turn right,

31:27.497 --> 31:30.933
drive for four blocks,
then turn left onto the first side street.

31:39.175 --> 31:41.303
Sam, we just had another call,
same cell tower.

31:41.477 --> 31:43.878
Strong signal.
I'd say four-block radius.

31:44.046 --> 31:45.673
You must be right on top of them.

31:45.848 --> 31:47.748
How far out are Kensi and Deeks?

31:47.917 --> 31:49.749
Three minutes behind you.

32:31.260 --> 32:32.785
Where is he?

32:33.629 --> 32:35.597
Anton first.

32:43.906 --> 32:45.465
He's in the trunk.

33:01.424 --> 33:02.585
Kensi, explosion,

33:02.758 --> 33:06.752
between 11th and 12th
off San Pedro, back street.

33:06.929 --> 33:08.658
We're going in hot.

33:12.134 --> 33:14.535
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Truck, Kens!

33:15.972 --> 33:17.872
- Hey!
- Here, here. Go, go, go.

35:30.705 --> 35:33.697
- Sam, SITREP.
- This way. Come on, team.

36:01.235 --> 36:02.498
Get down!

36:07.075 --> 36:08.406
G!

36:10.545 --> 36:12.309
- Kensi! Deeks!
- I'm up.

36:12.480 --> 36:14.107
- I'm up.
- Granger's been hit.

36:14.282 --> 36:17.115
Kensi, call it in.
Deeks, clear the weapons.

36:23.558 --> 36:24.753
Tell him

36:26.294 --> 36:29.662
the debt is paid.

37:09.704 --> 37:11.468
How's Granger?

37:12.306 --> 37:14.502
Not too happy.

37:14.809 --> 37:18.177
He's been shot
in that shoulder before.

37:25.153 --> 37:27.451
Someone else here to see you.

37:33.828 --> 37:36.126
I'm glad you're okay, old friend.

37:36.964 --> 37:38.955
I'm sorry you couldn't save him.

37:39.934 --> 37:42.995
He was a good man when I knew him
many years ago now.

37:44.405 --> 37:47.670
He wasn't Michael Reinhardt
back then.

37:50.444 --> 37:53.812
His real name was Hans Schreiber,
East German.

37:53.981 --> 37:58.282
He and his family escaped
to the West in 1969.

37:59.353 --> 38:02.812
Before you were born, Mr. Callen.

38:04.926 --> 38:08.521
- He couldn't have been my father.
- No.

38:08.696 --> 38:12.496
But I think he knew your father.

38:12.667 --> 38:14.157
Owed him a debt.

38:15.536 --> 38:17.698
"I owe him my life."

38:22.610 --> 38:24.806
"Tell him the debt was paid."

38:25.346 --> 38:30.182
Back in the 1970s,
I helped refugees start over in U.S.A.

38:30.351 --> 38:33.616
New lives, new names.

38:34.388 --> 38:36.880
Schreiber was one of many.

38:37.258 --> 38:40.193
He said he owed his life
to a Russian soldier.

38:40.962 --> 38:43.932
An officer who helped him escape.

38:44.098 --> 38:45.497
I believe they stayed in contact

38:45.666 --> 38:47.600
even after Schreiber
became Reinhardt

38:47.768 --> 38:49.827
and moved to America.

38:53.574 --> 38:58.705
Schreiber agreed
to keep track of you

38:59.213 --> 39:02.615
until your father could come back
for you and your sister.

39:04.619 --> 39:06.644
Only he never did.

39:08.089 --> 39:11.252
But Schreiber kept his promise.

39:11.425 --> 39:14.554
Watching you,
noting down every change of address,

39:14.729 --> 39:16.322
every foster home,

39:16.497 --> 39:19.159
and taking photographs.

39:20.701 --> 39:25.263
They thought he was my father,
and he let them believe it.

39:28.976 --> 39:30.705
Repaying the debt.

39:31.479 --> 39:38.317
I had Eric do an archive search
on Nikita Alexsandr Reznikov.

39:38.486 --> 39:44.220
There was a major in the KGB
by that name.

39:45.559 --> 39:46.583
Is he alive?

39:47.395 --> 39:49.625
He was arrested.

39:49.797 --> 39:53.927
Sent to a labor camp
in Siberia in 1974,

39:54.101 --> 39:57.264
just as you left Romania.

39:58.639 --> 40:01.734
There is no record of his death.

40:01.909 --> 40:04.776
It was a long time ago.

40:06.981 --> 40:08.779
Yes, it was.

40:10.151 --> 40:11.846
Henrietta.

40:19.694 --> 40:23.597
Mr. Deeks found this
amongst all the photographs.

40:23.764 --> 40:26.426
I thought you might like to have it.

40:31.772 --> 40:33.763
Good night, Mr. Callen.

40:35.109 --> 40:36.736
Good night, Hetty.
