on the last episode of ink master

00:03.780 --> 00:07.529
stop

00:05.160 --> 00:09.600
made rich return think before you ain't

00:07.529 --> 00:12.809
mass shopping all day and the pressure

00:09.600 --> 00:14.370
of the competition intensified it just

00:12.809 --> 00:17.400
sucks like I want to win a flash to me

00:14.370 --> 00:20.810
call my guy little grandma rare v-neck

00:17.400 --> 00:23.520
just heard in the Elimination tattoo

00:20.810 --> 00:25.380
veterans know how this game is played I

00:23.520 --> 00:27.300
need them to go home we're gonna give

00:25.380 --> 00:29.460
him the hard one beach shore like

00:27.300 --> 00:32.070
boardwalk palm trees blowing in the wind

00:29.460 --> 00:35.460
I figured everybody we coming after me I

00:32.070 --> 00:38.940
am pissed but their plan backfired

00:35.460 --> 00:41.040
did you see Carlos nurse yeah massive

00:38.940 --> 00:42.930
I'm confused at this point that I am

00:41.040 --> 00:44.850
even in an alliance the purpose of the

00:42.930 --> 00:47.340
challenges to detail it didn't work and

00:44.850 --> 00:49.530
was poorly done we hit detail that's the

00:47.340 --> 00:52.670
challenge you did too much you the judge

00:49.530 --> 00:55.860
in the Elimination think before you ink

00:52.670 --> 00:57.660
tri-cities tattoo and black anchor were

00:55.860 --> 00:59.880
the bottom three shops

00:57.660 --> 01:01.980
I felt like ours is a little bit more

00:59.880 --> 01:03.300
recognizable I didn't have any detail in

01:01.980 --> 01:05.280
that tattoo it's a little bit more

01:03.300 --> 01:07.320
dynamic than your guys it wasn't dynamic

01:05.280 --> 01:08.880
day it was detailed day are we not

01:07.320 --> 01:10.170
judging on the worst tattoo of the day

01:08.880 --> 01:12.090
because that's what I thought I was here

01:10.170 --> 01:15.179
to do the judges have decided

01:12.090 --> 01:18.469
black anchor you do not have what it

05:30.700 --> 05:37.310
skin on the body

05:33.410 --> 05:39.980
the ear tap tone' air is the hardest

05:37.310 --> 05:42.410
only because it's nowhere near a flat

05:39.980 --> 05:44.510
surface you're in like a lump or bump a

05:42.410 --> 05:46.580
curve it's ridiculous a nice straight

but that is not all you and your

07:11.310 --> 07:17.990
bottom of your skull will determine your

07:13.259 --> 07:24.669
artist Oldtown ink think before you ink

07:17.990 --> 07:27.229
allegory arts classic trilogy I knew it

07:24.669 --> 07:28.970
how are you gonna fit a sheet full of

07:27.229 --> 07:35.410
music in your ear this is impossible

07:28.970 --> 07:35.410
dude unkindness art that's a dragon

07:35.620 --> 07:42.250
how's the monkey

07:38.210 --> 07:46.100
tri-city tattoo artistic skin design

07:42.250 --> 07:49.780
okay artists you have two hours and your

07:46.100 --> 07:49.780
time begins now

07:51.340 --> 07:57.130
welcome to our domain the technical

07:55.210 --> 08:00.070
application on these tattoos has to be

07:57.130 --> 08:03.130
flawless so some of the skeleton key

08:00.070 --> 08:06.100
they're tiny small little tattoos on the

08:03.130 --> 08:09.310
ear we were talking a white wine fading

08:06.100 --> 08:11.500
down to a red wine will you do that any

08:09.310 --> 08:14.620
discrepancy is gonna stand out how many

08:11.500 --> 08:16.570
lines in music 506 if these teeth

08:14.620 --> 08:17.950
tattooers don't tattoo exactly the same

08:16.570 --> 08:19.660
way it's gonna be hard for them to make

08:17.950 --> 08:21.580
their tattoos look identical you know

08:19.660 --> 08:25.210
you can do these lines I can do anything

08:21.580 --> 08:26.560
okay just I don't do it all the time you

08:25.210 --> 08:28.150
are a little more familiar with

08:26.560 --> 08:30.280
traditional stuff just kind of take the

08:28.150 --> 08:32.620
lead if somebody has more experience

08:30.280 --> 08:34.270
we're gonna follow that and just go with

08:32.620 --> 08:36.520
the best idea what do you think about

08:34.270 --> 08:38.559
that I like it I think that if you do

08:36.520 --> 08:42.520
the three-quarter view that you should

08:38.559 --> 08:50.950
have a 3/4 view jaw I must say I'm

08:42.520 --> 08:53.140
thinking the teamwork yeah I'm like what

08:50.950 --> 08:55.300
are they scheduled we had to simplify it

08:53.140 --> 08:57.520
a little bit to shrink down to this size

08:55.300 --> 08:59.320
I can just she's the one with all these

08:57.520 --> 09:01.240
stipulations when wonder if you might

08:59.320 --> 09:03.040
get a little bit smaller if we go

09:01.240 --> 09:05.710
smaller I'm gonna probably lean towards

09:03.040 --> 09:07.120
making a solid what we want to keep it

09:05.710 --> 09:09.460
subtle so if you have a big black thing

09:07.120 --> 09:10.990
in the back she's calling the shots at

09:09.460 --> 09:13.110
this point she's making our job a lot

09:10.990 --> 09:16.200
harder I don't want us all

09:13.110 --> 09:19.620
huh yeah it's just like the smaller the

09:16.200 --> 09:20.760
less detail you can get see how it fits

09:19.620 --> 09:21.930
or not yeah okay

09:20.760 --> 09:24.510
it's not daily we want to get it on a

09:21.930 --> 09:26.820
flat surface we deserve to a master shop

09:24.510 --> 09:29.460
because at theme we know we got to do

09:26.820 --> 09:31.860
for our team to get things done I'm

09:29.460 --> 09:33.750
gonna tattoo first and then D kotatsu

09:31.860 --> 09:36.120
second just to make sure at the end of

09:33.750 --> 09:37.620
the day our tattoos match up seamlessly

09:36.120 --> 09:39.240
you see the top loop

09:37.620 --> 09:41.570
yeah see that one and now follow the

09:39.240 --> 09:41.570
bottom

09:44.620 --> 09:47.740
the middle lines are basically leave

09:46.000 --> 09:49.990
them like that just go over those

09:47.740 --> 09:51.610
they're too close pretty hard to put my

09:49.990 --> 09:52.960
ego aside and a lot of things but next

09:51.610 --> 09:55.330
to DJ it's not hard at all

09:52.960 --> 09:56.860
go away deeper dude don't be afraid you

09:55.330 --> 09:58.720
know I'm getting it this is absolutely

09:56.860 --> 10:00.310
not the time to set myself apart from my

09:58.720 --> 10:02.560
teammate or trying to look identical

10:00.310 --> 10:05.440
the little tentacles then and it meets

10:02.560 --> 10:06.700
the other one oh no I'm getting this

10:05.440 --> 10:07.360
broken bones you know what I'm talking

10:06.700 --> 10:09.670
about yeah

10:07.360 --> 10:11.830
okay I honestly don't know if Bubba's

10:09.670 --> 10:13.480
even here at all I know that DJ is

10:11.830 --> 10:15.990
definitely pulling the strings in this

10:13.480 --> 10:15.990
relationship

10:17.110 --> 10:21.700
maybe before you're done we both look at

10:19.420 --> 10:24.370
them next to each other and discuss a

10:21.700 --> 10:27.910
little cure decent that I don't think we

10:24.370 --> 10:28.990
should have anything else okay we really

10:27.910 --> 10:30.430
need to win this challenge because

10:28.990 --> 10:32.290
they're testing us

10:30.430 --> 10:34.420
I'd be damned if I come back and not

10:32.290 --> 10:36.250
have the technical ability to win this I

10:34.420 --> 10:38.380
still before you're completely done we

10:36.250 --> 10:40.030
should check it out we can make tattoos

10:38.380 --> 10:46.330
that look the same if we're not

10:40.030 --> 10:48.340
communicating some reason I thought

10:46.330 --> 10:50.620
these were gonna be really painful this

10:48.340 --> 10:54.370
would be the time for me to separate

10:50.620 --> 10:55.540
myself from my teammate yeah did you

10:54.370 --> 10:58.570
want to take a look at this while she's

10:55.540 --> 11:00.580
standing aren't we supposed to have

10:58.570 --> 11:02.710
matching air tattoos let's play tomorrow

11:00.580 --> 11:03.970
a little darker than yours it's almost

11:02.710 --> 11:06.210
like we're competing with each other at

11:03.970 --> 11:06.210
this point

11:08.300 --> 11:15.650
five four three two one

11:13.520 --> 11:17.000
that's it machines down time is up no

11:15.650 --> 11:19.260
more ink

11:17.000 --> 11:25.740
done

11:19.260 --> 11:28.920
we're back okay artists it is now time

11:25.740 --> 11:30.300
to critique your work tri-cities tattoo

11:28.920 --> 11:32.280
you guys definitely look like two

11:30.300 --> 11:33.930
different people did it bang you have

11:32.280 --> 11:35.370
some blow-ups towards the bottom which

11:33.930 --> 11:37.260
is probably why I kind of heavier cuz

11:35.370 --> 11:39.450
you were cleaning up a little Dave yours

11:37.260 --> 11:41.190
was a lot cleaner crisp outline and the

11:39.450 --> 11:42.540
shape of the key was very straight

11:41.190 --> 11:44.720
they look like they're competing against

11:42.540 --> 11:48.240
each other not working with each other

11:44.720 --> 11:50.130
classic trilogy tattoo there's seven

11:48.240 --> 11:53.160
lines in there six lines we just counted

11:50.130 --> 11:54.600
seven typically there's five okay to

11:53.160 --> 11:56.430
give yourself more lines than what there

11:54.600 --> 11:57.600
should be makes it even harder to do and

11:56.430 --> 11:59.400
the ten a little bit in the air you guys

11:57.600 --> 12:02.400
made some weird decisions I don't love

11:59.400 --> 12:03.660
this one pins and needles you did a good

12:02.400 --> 12:05.820
job make it look like the same person

12:03.660 --> 12:08.070
did it I like the fact that every line

12:05.820 --> 12:11.270
looks deliberate you guys seem to hit

12:08.070 --> 12:13.590
everything directly one shot one pass

12:11.270 --> 12:15.450
artistic skin design technical

12:13.590 --> 12:17.550
application is very clean on these but

12:15.450 --> 12:19.200
the designs look different from one year

12:17.550 --> 12:21.720
to the next you guys have been crushing

12:19.200 --> 12:23.210
it but I think this one you overworked

12:21.720 --> 12:25.920
yourselves

12:23.210 --> 12:28.230
think before you ink there's more of a

12:25.920 --> 12:30.480
consistent hand on riches throughout the

12:28.230 --> 12:32.580
entire outline needs hat you hit a major

12:30.480 --> 12:34.170
bump in the glass and their minimal

12:32.580 --> 12:36.480
amount of work which means every bit of

12:34.170 --> 12:38.190
it has to be perfect I did a good job in

12:36.480 --> 12:40.380
this piece but as a team we're getting a

12:38.190 --> 12:43.800
back ratite this sucks

12:40.380 --> 12:45.840
Old Town Inc it's very tight clean crisp

12:43.800 --> 12:47.430
very small line details and they both

12:45.840 --> 12:49.290
look like they have great technical

12:47.430 --> 12:50.430
application similar design looks like

12:49.290 --> 12:51.060
the same artist did it that's what we're

12:50.430 --> 12:54.560
looking for

12:51.060 --> 12:56.580
killer next team up is allegory arts

12:54.560 --> 12:58.770
technical application of both these is

12:56.580 --> 13:00.240
on par with each other my only nitpick

12:58.770 --> 13:02.250
your finger Babbage's the anatomy

13:00.240 --> 13:05.570
there's no forehead and then the jaw is

13:02.250 --> 13:08.400
huge but I do think it is a bull tattoo

13:05.570 --> 13:10.620
unkindness art you had a tougher road

13:08.400 --> 13:11.370
with the actual shape of the years being

13:10.620 --> 13:13.200
so different

13:11.370 --> 13:15.270
yeah it just wraps differently because

13:13.200 --> 13:17.520
of her anatomy but overall the technical

13:15.270 --> 13:19.920
application in both ears is on par with

13:17.520 --> 13:21.930
each other solid team work you do thank

13:19.920 --> 13:22.860
you House of monkey this was a really

13:21.930 --> 13:24.900
tough challenge trying to fund the

13:22.860 --> 13:26.490
dragon going up the ear but the

13:24.900 --> 13:27.060
difference between the two is pretty

13:26.490 --> 13:28.530
obvious

13:27.060 --> 13:29.970
Picasa as yours has a little bit lighter

13:28.530 --> 13:31.740
will scratch your look and levels your

13:29.970 --> 13:33.240
looks a little more punched in you guys

13:31.740 --> 13:35.250
are held closest to the fire on this

13:33.240 --> 13:37.500
show up or you're gonna be right back

13:35.250 --> 13:39.060
out we arguably had the hardest

13:37.500 --> 13:42.530
challenge of the day I don't think it

13:39.060 --> 13:42.530
looks scratchy at all some bull

13:42.880 --> 13:47.830
I was looking to get like a gothic theme

13:45.640 --> 13:52.300
into angel that's just not the challenge

13:47.830 --> 13:56.050
we are so frickin bone the stencil keeps

13:52.300 --> 13:57.700
wiping off I'm melting down how did you

13:56.050 --> 13:59.260
find working with tri-cities tattoo it

13:57.700 --> 14:00.790
was a little bit challenging we didn't

13:59.260 --> 14:02.590
really see much of them when they were

14:00.790 --> 14:03.820
working on the design we didn't really

14:02.590 --> 14:05.740
get a chance to provide feedback

14:03.820 --> 14:07.960
ultimately are you guys happy I wish

14:05.740 --> 14:09.190
mine was a little bit lighter I didn't

14:07.960 --> 14:11.700
know she was unhappy I'm shocked that

14:09.190 --> 14:11.700
she said that

14:16.290 --> 14:20.549
today we're testing technical

14:17.939 --> 14:23.040
application and the return of Picasso

14:20.549 --> 14:24.449
and Lalo this is one of the big stinkers

14:23.040 --> 14:26.429
of the day it certainly doesn't look

14:24.449 --> 14:28.319
like the same artist did those Lalo and

14:26.429 --> 14:31.769
Picasso didn't hit the mark on technical

14:28.319 --> 14:34.019
application of the day who stands out to

14:31.769 --> 14:35.850
you pins and needles they have some of

14:34.019 --> 14:37.109
the strongest application the big part

14:35.850 --> 14:38.639
of this challenge today is doing two

14:37.109 --> 14:40.410
tattoos look the same and they

14:38.639 --> 14:42.479
definitely accomplish that the suck

14:40.410 --> 14:45.299
about old town they obviously have

14:42.479 --> 14:47.970
strong tiny detail abilities very clean

14:45.299 --> 14:50.009
line work only smart decisions legible

14:47.970 --> 14:51.600
and they both look the same you want to

14:50.009 --> 14:57.509
make a decision yeah all right that's

14:51.600 --> 14:59.970
enough all right artists today some of

14:57.509 --> 15:02.309
you had flawless technical application

14:59.970 --> 15:05.500
the judges have decided the winner of

15:02.309 --> 15:06.830
today's Flash challenge is

15:05.500 --> 15:09.620
[Music]

15:06.830 --> 15:11.779

15:09.620 --> 15:14.000
I'm here to win I don't give it all that

15:11.779 --> 15:15.470
DJ to take the spotlight I'm here to

15:14.000 --> 15:16.970
prove just how much I've grown how much

15:15.470 --> 15:18.730
I've learned how much I can actually

15:16.970 --> 15:21.860

15:23.810 --> 15:26.660
human canvases in the next elimination

15:25.910 --> 15:29.000
tattoo

15:26.660 --> 15:29.870
Bubba does not have a strategy it's DJ

15:29.000 --> 15:32.990
I'm worried about

15:29.870 --> 15:34.610

15:32.990 --> 15:37.150
of freaking out about it we can all head

15:34.610 --> 15:37.150
back to the loft

15:37.660 --> 15:42.250
I do tell you wanna play this you want

15:40.450 --> 15:44.260
to give ourselves the best I think we

15:42.250 --> 15:45.610
should give ourselves a smart play a lot

15:44.260 --> 15:46.870
of times people get the school picks and

15:45.610 --> 15:48.490
they get so excited that they try to

15:46.870 --> 15:50.200
take the easy road and go to easier take

15:48.490 --> 15:52.630
the hard road ooh we did that too yeah

15:50.200 --> 15:54.190
we just need to not you know butt heads

15:52.630 --> 15:55.900
at all I mean we do you know I feel

15:54.190 --> 15:57.850
bossy but I'm like do this and you're

15:55.900 --> 15:59.350
like I was gonna you know like that's

15:57.850 --> 16:01.090
how it is yeah we're good friends

15:59.350 --> 16:02.620
anyways and I think that's gonna bring

16:01.090 --> 16:03.760
us far in this whole challenge we're so

16:02.620 --> 16:06.060
pumped to end out these schools right

16:03.760 --> 16:06.060

16:24.990 --> 16:32.850
shot at $200,000 and the first-ever

16:29.070 --> 16:35.280
title of Master sha Lala and Picasso as

16:32.850 --> 16:37.110
the veteran artists is on your shop to

16:35.280 --> 16:40.650
prove that you deserve to be here by

16:37.110 --> 16:41.040
overcoming your weaknesses and in their

16:40.650 --> 16:43.080
honor

16:41.040 --> 16:47.690
you'll all be judged on technical

16:43.080 --> 16:53.060
applications today the must tattoo

16:47.690 --> 16:54.740
a black-and-gray cherub all-around

16:53.060 --> 16:56.120
cherubs are not easy to tattoo

16:54.740 --> 16:58.160
they have little fingers they've learned

16:56.120 --> 16:59.810
OSes that little eyes a little cheeks in

16:58.160 --> 17:01.520
your application has to be solid

16:59.810 --> 17:04.010
otherwise this cherub is gonna be

17:01.520 --> 17:06.609
looking real weird for this elimination

17:04.010 --> 17:09.859
tattoo you and your teammate must each

17:06.609 --> 17:13.430
tattoo a cherub on the same canvas at

17:09.859 --> 17:16.790
the same time this is gonna be a tug of

17:13.430 --> 17:18.829
war he's gonna be pulling I'm gonna be

17:16.790 --> 17:20.810
pulling it's gonna be insane

17:18.829 --> 17:23.359
today you're doing your own tattoo the

17:20.810 --> 17:25.130
catch is both tattoos have to look like

17:23.359 --> 17:27.020
the same person did them so this is what

17:25.130 --> 17:29.990
we're really gonna test who can do what

17:27.020 --> 17:31.610
remember your team you guys don't want

17:29.990 --> 17:33.320
to bump each other off but you also

17:31.610 --> 17:35.390
don't want to dumb yourself down and

17:33.320 --> 17:38.720
turn up in the bottom you're on your own

17:35.390 --> 17:41.420
put your together remember after every

17:38.720 --> 17:43.010
elimination tattoo all of you will form

17:41.420 --> 17:44.930
the jury of peers

17:43.010 --> 17:46.460
you'll deliberate and choose one shop to

17:44.930 --> 17:49.270
put up for elimination

18:14.320 --> 18:19.900
weaknesses exposed frying cherub while

18:19.900 --> 18:23.890
getting both your arms I was pretty set

18:21.940 --> 18:26.110
on the back in the army those are two

18:23.890 --> 18:28.720
areas that cannot be tattooed at the

18:26.110 --> 18:31.570
same time unless you can remove your arm

18:28.720 --> 18:34.300
that's the nightmare piece cherubs

playing hide and seek and cherubs

18:34.300 --> 18:41.800
wrestling for assurance geez let's just

18:43.570 --> 18:48.130
evil chair over my left chest and a good

18:45.910 --> 18:50.410
chair of my right chest chest is one of

18:48.130 --> 18:51.240
the most painful place to tattoo two at

18:50.410 --> 18:52.679
the same time

18:51.240 --> 18:56.309
[Music]

18:52.679 --> 18:57.330

be hard to do this is a cherub challenge

19:00.210 --> 19:05.019

19:03.299 --> 19:08.749
horrible

19:05.019 --> 19:10.489
let's begin this is our second skull

19:08.749 --> 19:12.320

Old Town Inc page here mark

19:42.000 --> 19:47.750
[Music]

19:47.750 --> 19:52.059
case O'Town ink if I get a skull pick

19:50.330 --> 19:58.390
I'm just gonna shoot you in your ass

19:52.059 --> 19:58.390
unkindness art allegory arts

20:01.770 --> 20:07.660
artistic skin design apparently old town

20:05.680 --> 20:10.530
thought it would be a great idea to give

20:07.660 --> 20:11.770
us the canvas that doesn't one sheriff

20:10.530 --> 20:14.820
goddammit

20:11.770 --> 20:17.620
you will have six hours to tattoo to

20:14.820 --> 20:20.470
smooth black and gray cherubs on your

20:17.620 --> 20:23.700
canvas based on your work one shop will

20:20.470 --> 20:23.700
be out good luck

20:24.320 --> 20:29.580
there's no better way to prove technical

20:27.809 --> 20:31.769
application then with a cherub

20:29.580 --> 20:33.809
- baby style one on each shoulder in the

20:31.769 --> 20:35.940
back these tattoos are very easy to mess

20:33.809 --> 20:37.860
up you've got to have perfect Anatomy it

20:35.940 --> 20:39.899
has to look lifelike and it also has to

20:37.860 --> 20:43.049
look cute how do you draw a little fat

20:39.899 --> 20:45.119
baby angel these artists have to tattoo

20:43.049 --> 20:46.320
the same canvas at the same time you

20:45.119 --> 20:46.710
ready good tattoo here two people at

20:46.320 --> 20:48.659
once

20:46.710 --> 20:50.369
I'm ready we're gonna see who has what

20:48.659 --> 20:52.649
strengths and who has what weaknesses

20:50.369 --> 20:54.600
inside each team all right let's talk

20:52.649 --> 20:56.759
these ideas the one on the arm I'm

20:54.600 --> 20:58.710
pretty set on how long though the back

20:56.759 --> 21:00.809
and arm thing is them they're impossible

20:58.710 --> 21:02.879
to do here the only way that we'll be

21:00.809 --> 21:05.129
able to do these pieces if we commence

21:02.879 --> 21:06.840
this man to move one of these tattoos to

21:05.129 --> 21:08.820
another location do you mean another

21:06.840 --> 21:14.340
location anything

21:08.820 --> 21:16.529
I mean maybe both arms raises to the

21:14.340 --> 21:16.799
most high this canvas is so easy to work

21:16.529 --> 21:19.350
with

21:16.799 --> 21:21.600
O'Town ink intentionally tried to throw

21:19.350 --> 21:24.179
us a curveball but nothing's gonna faze

21:21.600 --> 21:27.299
us I was looking to get like a gothic

21:24.179 --> 21:28.980
themed angel one on my shoulder and a

21:27.299 --> 21:30.570
lower back they have to be cherubs so

21:28.980 --> 21:32.999
they have to look like little babies I

21:30.570 --> 21:35.700
don't want to do too much of the baby

21:32.999 --> 21:38.220
face to it that's just not the challenge

21:35.700 --> 21:42.610
why did you come on cherub day if you

21:38.220 --> 21:51.520
don't want chair we are so frickin bone

21:42.610 --> 21:55.580
[Music]

21:51.520 --> 21:58.570
yeah it's back oh you're good there's a

21:55.580 --> 22:00.650
lot of pressure here just a wee darling

21:58.570 --> 22:02.330
do you want to do it a little smaller

22:00.650 --> 22:04.370
and then not reconsider we're losing

22:02.330 --> 22:06.170
detail on the face yeah but so many

22:04.370 --> 22:09.440
people in this competition go our way

22:06.170 --> 22:11.660
because of size yeah you're making me

22:09.440 --> 22:13.970
over thank already got our canvas is

22:11.660 --> 22:16.100
great because of why do you have to make

22:13.970 --> 22:18.290
it difficult you know why the last

22:16.100 --> 22:20.330
people that keep that right because I

22:18.290 --> 22:22.340
did a giant Lee's we're not building or

22:20.330 --> 22:24.080
driving we could bring both down a

22:22.340 --> 22:25.670
little I'll go oh my god

22:24.080 --> 22:28.400
I need to concentrate I'm the one

22:25.670 --> 22:29.540
drawing let's stay in our lane just

22:28.400 --> 22:32.180
something it's done so on and then we'll

22:29.540 --> 22:35.009
figure it out okay I I don't want to get

22:32.180 --> 22:39.369
frustrated don't be frustrated

22:35.009 --> 22:43.359
because I did okay artists you have six

22:39.369 --> 22:45.080
hours to tattoo two cherubs on a single

22:43.359 --> 22:47.830
canvas

22:45.080 --> 22:48.910
and your time starts

22:47.830 --> 22:52.540
[Music]

22:48.910 --> 22:54.580
now today these tattooers are gonna

22:52.540 --> 22:56.530
tattoo on their own but they have to

22:54.580 --> 22:58.540
look like one artist in them I think a

22:56.530 --> 23:01.000
little bit of texture in the front would

22:58.540 --> 23:02.770
be cool perfect it is incredibly easy to

23:01.000 --> 23:04.540
mess up cherub tattoos the technical

23:02.770 --> 23:06.190
application has to be spot-on very

23:04.540 --> 23:07.990
washed outline everything I'm just gonna

23:06.190 --> 23:09.340
get great on it hey have you feel

23:07.990 --> 23:12.280
comfort with it so many things

23:09.340 --> 23:15.420
anatomically can go wrong here how's the

23:12.280 --> 23:15.420
monkey how's the monkey

23:20.590 --> 23:26.179
okay I'm going to the face outline real

23:22.760 --> 23:28.610
quick okay okay our canvas wanted adult

23:26.179 --> 23:31.730
angels not cherubs we finally

23:28.610 --> 23:35.090
compromised and we're doing children

23:31.730 --> 23:36.650
angels I think this is a bad idea to go

23:35.090 --> 23:41.740
like back and forth with important stuff

23:36.650 --> 23:45.020
[Music]

23:41.740 --> 23:46.700
I think we can skate back did you do

23:45.020 --> 23:49.039
your Olive Branch ready yeah

23:46.700 --> 23:51.380
I personally don't tattoo a ton of black

23:49.039 --> 23:52.549
and gray tattoos and Dane does so I'm

23:51.380 --> 23:53.990
just gonna pick his brain while we're

23:52.549 --> 23:55.669
sitting there you're always pretty way

23:53.990 --> 23:58.700
bigger than mine maybe just like having

23:55.669 --> 24:00.470
fan out like wider here we go it's

23:58.700 --> 24:02.179
really difficult to make two tattoos

24:00.470 --> 24:03.649
look like one person did them if I'm low

24:02.179 --> 24:05.210
in the table or anything tell me it's

24:03.649 --> 24:06.649
something I'm definitely hoping Bob is

24:05.210 --> 24:08.000
gonna be able to keep up if it's black

24:06.649 --> 24:09.770
in the photo you make it black in this

24:08.000 --> 24:11.270
tattoo the pressure is definitely on me

24:09.770 --> 24:13.010
right now DJ has a lot more experience

24:11.270 --> 24:14.600
than me once it's done it pulls all

24:13.010 --> 24:16.220
together what I'm gonna do is just do my

24:14.600 --> 24:18.580
best to mimic his strategy and his

24:16.220 --> 24:18.580
technique

24:20.340 --> 24:25.260
check out how I'm doing love you during

24:22.530 --> 24:27.840
the loins see that yeah black and gray

24:25.260 --> 24:29.640
is something that I definitely don't

24:27.840 --> 24:32.070
specialize in it also shade those

24:29.640 --> 24:32.460
fingers I'm having to have Erin hold my

24:32.070 --> 24:35.970
hand

24:32.460 --> 24:38.640
yes okay mm-hmm use it as reference in

24:35.970 --> 24:40.350
here okay this is absolutely the

24:38.640 --> 24:41.940
challenge that's going to show which

24:40.350 --> 24:43.980
artist in each team is the weaker link

24:41.940 --> 24:46.010
do you wanna use any whiteness at all

24:43.980 --> 24:50.140
nope no I don't either

24:46.010 --> 24:55.180
four hours to go guys four more hours

24:50.140 --> 24:57.610
[Music]

24:55.180 --> 24:58.720
positive feeling not too bad that's good

24:57.610 --> 24:59.530
you need to take a break just say

24:58.720 --> 25:01.450
something okay

24:59.530 --> 25:03.160
this campus wanted wrestling cherubs and

25:01.450 --> 25:05.020
hide-and-seek cherubs do you think you

25:03.160 --> 25:06.010
went too big are you comfortable in size

25:05.020 --> 25:06.970
I'm fine with it

25:06.010 --> 25:08.500
so we're gonna go more in an

25:06.970 --> 25:09.700
illustrative design because it does play

25:08.500 --> 25:11.200
to our strengths we do know how to

25:09.700 --> 25:12.580
manage our time with this one and this

25:11.200 --> 25:14.560
and it from the beginning we swing for

25:12.580 --> 25:16.650
the fences we try to go big yeah that's

25:14.560 --> 25:18.850
what we're here for

25:16.650 --> 25:20.440
we're just looking at a little bit of

25:18.850 --> 25:22.240
line work in the news I might just throw

25:20.440 --> 25:24.880
that in there at the base of it is

25:22.240 --> 25:27.910
Alison is adding a thicker line than

25:24.880 --> 25:32.830
expected I'm not used to putting line

25:27.910 --> 25:34.060
work in my realism I don't I don't know

25:32.830 --> 25:37.840
how this is gonna pan out

25:34.060 --> 25:39.340
Jessi's just covered outside the lines

25:37.840 --> 25:42.850
instantly the second thing you don't hit

25:39.340 --> 25:44.380
and then the others nice yeah artistic

25:42.850 --> 25:47.260
skin design they're doing clean Pat's

25:44.380 --> 25:49.870
they didn't dare be it's the name of the

25:47.260 --> 25:53.110
channel those arty nubs right now it's

25:49.870 --> 25:55.570
the Battle of who's gonna yeah I need

25:53.110 --> 25:59.800
you to just make sure that everything

25:55.570 --> 26:02.530
over here is right I am stressed out to

25:59.800 --> 26:03.820
no end the stencil keeps wiping off I'm

26:02.530 --> 26:06.100
so far behind

26:03.820 --> 26:09.370
I'm literally melting down take a

26:06.100 --> 26:12.490
sharpie and do like a loose indication

26:09.370 --> 26:14.830
of the line I don't have a clue how this

26:12.490 --> 26:16.930
is gonna work out if I've got a draw on

26:14.830 --> 26:19.650
every line before I do it do it one more

26:16.930 --> 26:19.650
go I suppose

26:20.460 --> 26:26.429
wait let me do it oh yeah we work

26:24.330 --> 26:28.259
together like two Lumberjacks on the

26:26.429 --> 26:31.320
opposite ends of a saw cutting on a tree

26:28.259 --> 26:33.690
are you fighting yes we know how to work

26:31.320 --> 26:35.759
with each other on our best days and our

26:33.690 --> 26:36.929
worst days I did their little shading

26:35.759 --> 26:37.320
you told me on the leg and it looks

26:36.929 --> 26:39.269
great

26:37.320 --> 26:44.749
oh yeah I do have some good ideas you

26:39.269 --> 26:44.749
have good ideas one hour remaining kids

26:46.410 --> 26:50.660
[Music]

26:48.110 --> 26:54.200
if they fucking face it with the shade

26:50.660 --> 26:56.510
under like how to stop we see you I hit

26:54.200 --> 26:58.010
one of the other lines Dave style is

26:56.510 --> 26:59.570
totally different from my thing just

26:58.010 --> 27:01.460
make sure you just keep the skin tight

26:59.570 --> 27:03.740
and it doesn't need like too much

27:01.460 --> 27:05.270
pressure our communication is really

27:03.740 --> 27:07.370
working or checking out each other's

27:05.270 --> 27:08.870
tattoo he's giving me advice this is the

27:07.370 --> 27:13.700
best that we've ever been working

27:08.870 --> 27:15.020
together as a team so none I told myself

27:13.700 --> 27:17.480
I was gonna make your life a living hell

27:15.020 --> 27:20.300
but me but I'll leave it on tri-cities

27:17.480 --> 27:26.480
what is your motive in this game your

27:20.300 --> 27:28.160
plane yeah sorry I talk a lot but I got

27:26.480 --> 27:30.500
the skills to back it up you showed your

27:28.160 --> 27:31.610
colors Dave I'm the vet they could have

27:30.500 --> 27:33.020
had a friend in this house

27:31.610 --> 27:35.360
people always thinking I'm starting I

27:33.020 --> 27:37.570
will be scope you saying he's annoying

27:35.360 --> 27:37.570
us

27:38.029 --> 27:46.210
five four three two

27:43.360 --> 27:47.470
that's it machines down time is up no

27:46.210 --> 27:51.340
more ink

27:47.470 --> 27:54.340
thank you all right Asst bill is just so

27:51.340 --> 27:55.630
sickly made rich talks so much but he

27:54.340 --> 27:58.270
can't back it up with being able to

27:55.630 --> 28:01.390
tattoo your tattoo looks like a toy

27:58.270 --> 28:04.980
sleeping on cabbage God do I want made

28:01.390 --> 28:04.980
rich and think before you eat to go home

28:05.190 --> 28:08.999
do you think that he has what it takes

28:07.169 --> 28:10.379
to carry you to the end

28:08.999 --> 28:12.539
yeah I'm not gonna come at me and expect

28:10.379 --> 28:15.239
me to not come at y'all you can see a

28:12.539 --> 28:17.279
blowout through solid black a lot of it

28:15.239 --> 28:20.929
he's the worst two tattoos y'all does to

28:17.279 --> 28:20.929
chug out here it's not gonna work out

28:23.460 --> 28:28.230
I know what it's like to be the new

28:26.400 --> 28:30.570
people in the house and just know that

28:28.230 --> 28:31.650
was designed for y'all to come back and

28:30.570 --> 28:33.300
show the hell out

28:31.650 --> 28:34.950
it's a warm-up the difference about

28:33.300 --> 28:37.290
y'all team as opposed to the other

28:34.950 --> 28:39.420
returning teams I have two vets yes

28:37.290 --> 28:41.160
honestly came in the lion's den with me

28:39.420 --> 28:42.570
hanging around your neck we have zero

28:41.160 --> 28:43.890
intentions of making it easier on

28:42.570 --> 28:45.690
anybody who walks in that door if you

28:43.890 --> 28:47.580
show your flaws you guys better be ready

28:45.690 --> 28:49.800
plus we're focusing on the people that

28:47.580 --> 28:51.630
we don't think come up to par and you

28:49.800 --> 28:54.000
guys don't even meet up to them

28:51.630 --> 28:56.250
it sounds personal for real t-t-tech do

28:54.000 --> 28:58.590
you think that he has what it takes to

28:56.250 --> 29:00.540
carry you to the end I stand behind and

28:58.590 --> 29:02.610
lose a draw this is how it goes down

29:00.540 --> 29:04.320
your boy made rich rolled in here

29:02.610 --> 29:06.270
throwing blind punches left and right

29:04.320 --> 29:08.070
I'm gonna defend my work but you can bet

29:06.270 --> 29:10.500
every single I tried to defend my work

29:08.070 --> 29:12.750
regardless of how you feel this is gonna

29:10.500 --> 29:16.260
run your mouth to talk off you can't

29:12.750 --> 29:17.310
just only bring that up when y'all play

29:16.260 --> 29:19.140
- shut up game I'm just gonna keep

29:17.310 --> 29:20.370
talking it seems respectful but I never

29:19.140 --> 29:21.990
told not many others shut up

29:20.370 --> 29:24.170
just put your tattoos where your mouth

29:21.990 --> 29:24.170
is

29:34.240 --> 29:39.039
[Music]

29:36.700 --> 29:40.779
today you had to prove your technical

29:39.039 --> 29:42.850
application was flawless Lalo and

29:40.779 --> 29:45.100
Picasso this challenge was designed to

29:42.850 --> 29:45.519
test your weaknesses so let's see how

29:45.100 --> 29:50.529
you did

29:45.519 --> 29:52.749
how's the monkey here up first overall

29:50.529 --> 29:55.749
the designs are nice technical

29:52.749 --> 29:57.190
applications on par Picasso I think your

29:55.749 --> 29:59.499
biggest problem in the tattoo is the

29:57.190 --> 30:01.029
face he's got a cross-eyed look his nose

29:59.499 --> 30:03.249
is crooked and you just put a little

30:01.029 --> 30:05.109
hard be con him I follow my reference

30:03.249 --> 30:06.909
but I do see what you're saying but I

30:05.109 --> 30:08.679
would say from the last time we saw both

30:06.909 --> 30:10.659
you in this competition this is much

30:08.679 --> 30:13.679
more consistent line work and much

30:10.659 --> 30:13.679
cleaner it's pretty good

30:13.760 --> 30:17.170
tri-cities tattoo

30:17.300 --> 30:21.620
looking at both the tattoos it looks

30:19.970 --> 30:23.720
like one person did it because both of

30:21.620 --> 30:25.850
you have incredibly hard times outlining

30:23.720 --> 30:27.830
banging the back of your inside leg and

30:25.850 --> 30:29.840
that huge crazy line you tried to clean

30:27.830 --> 30:31.550
up you have to do it in one pass Dave

30:29.840 --> 30:33.860
your outline this variant blown out

30:31.550 --> 30:36.860
let's go in the hand and then the hair

30:33.860 --> 30:39.200
this collarbone area is a really tough

30:36.860 --> 30:43.940
area that is nothing but a technical

30:39.200 --> 30:46.809
application issue old Tony

30:43.940 --> 30:49.120
[Applause]

30:46.809 --> 30:51.580
technically both of you show a lot of

30:49.120 --> 30:53.470
really nice application DJ I love the

30:51.580 --> 30:55.090
position I love the pose I love the

30:53.470 --> 30:56.860
elements and the way she shaded the

30:55.090 --> 30:58.990
tattoo looks like it's supposed to look

30:56.860 --> 30:59.620
well a couple of things get away from

30:58.990 --> 31:01.990
you

30:59.620 --> 31:03.880
you definitely age the kid a little bit

31:01.990 --> 31:06.220
you definitely sunk his eyes in a little

31:03.880 --> 31:07.780
bit you've got to stay soft I don't

31:06.220 --> 31:09.960
think these look like the same artist

31:07.780 --> 31:09.960
did

31:10.700 --> 31:13.690
think before you ink

31:14.429 --> 31:18.179
well guys there's an obvious divide here

31:16.350 --> 31:19.799
rich your tattoos a lot smoother you

31:18.179 --> 31:21.750
have a lot cleaner outline and a lot

31:19.799 --> 31:23.460
smoother shading your tattoo quality

31:21.750 --> 31:26.460
definitely progress from when you were

31:23.460 --> 31:28.980
here like vtag your shows a big variance

31:26.460 --> 31:31.020
from rich as far as application goes you

31:28.980 --> 31:32.909
have a lot of shaky lines the tips of

31:31.020 --> 31:34.559
the fingers are blacker than the line

31:32.909 --> 31:36.210
coming down there is a way to pull a

31:34.559 --> 31:42.059
really clean line and you're missing it

31:36.210 --> 31:43.919
on this artistic skin design these are

31:42.059 --> 31:46.169
the worst two tattoos y'all done since

31:43.919 --> 31:49.529
y'all got here it's Anatomy so weird

31:46.169 --> 31:51.179
April what is up with the extra pupil

31:49.529 --> 31:53.730
the eye on the right of the screen is

31:51.179 --> 31:55.799
going crazy you know the tear duct too

31:53.730 --> 31:58.049
big this is not what we've seen from you

31:55.799 --> 31:59.970
so far you two are the two that worked

31:58.049 --> 32:02.220
the best together and seemingly the

31:59.970 --> 32:05.490
worst apart

32:02.220 --> 32:08.370
classic trilogy tattoo you couldn't be

32:05.490 --> 32:10.410
further apart on design and tattoos the

32:08.370 --> 32:12.360
dynamics of the characters that Tom drew

32:10.410 --> 32:13.890
versus the dynamics of the characters

32:12.360 --> 32:15.360
character are totally different look at

32:13.890 --> 32:17.010
the hands look at the noses look at the

32:15.360 --> 32:18.360
mouths look at the bodies the whole

32:17.010 --> 32:20.430
challenge here is working off of each

32:18.360 --> 32:25.620
other in that category you guys hit

32:20.430 --> 32:27.980
bottom you have to operate as one is and

32:25.620 --> 32:27.980
needles

32:28.740 --> 32:34.210
these do not look like the same person

32:31.030 --> 32:35.710
to them at all I have to say it Allison

32:34.210 --> 32:37.870
you killed it you blew her out of the

32:35.710 --> 32:41.110
water you got a beautiful child like

32:37.870 --> 32:43.000
cherub face best eyes in the room Jessie

32:41.110 --> 32:44.740
really rough shading here the hand

32:43.000 --> 32:46.059
holding the scale it just looks like he

32:44.740 --> 32:48.010
shaded over it where your shading the

32:46.059 --> 32:49.240
wing this is where we start to see the

32:48.010 --> 32:50.740
divide in the room you're gonna have to

32:49.240 --> 32:53.370
work more as a team you're gonna work

32:50.740 --> 32:58.600
together no matter what

32:53.370 --> 33:00.220
unkindness art I love the interaction of

32:58.600 --> 33:02.440
these two characters from one leg to the

33:00.220 --> 33:04.059
next designs were dynamic the layout was

33:02.440 --> 33:05.950
dynamic but it's pretty apparent that

33:04.059 --> 33:07.300
Aaron's tattoo is a lot nicer I think

33:05.950 --> 33:09.070
I'm about half a mountain experienced

33:07.300 --> 33:10.570
tattooing as she is and so I was trying

33:09.070 --> 33:13.000
to catch up to the tricks that she knows

33:10.570 --> 33:14.350
you have a big separation from where the

33:13.000 --> 33:16.480
eye goes through the bridge of the nose

33:14.350 --> 33:18.429
and the forehead protrudes forward so

33:16.480 --> 33:19.420
it's throwing the design off Aaron

33:18.429 --> 33:22.540
George is beautiful

33:19.420 --> 33:25.059
the face the gestures this really

33:22.540 --> 33:28.710
detailed fine line wings the beautiful

33:25.059 --> 33:28.710
hair that you did great job Aaron

33:28.740 --> 33:36.690
allegory arts I do love the illustration

33:34.710 --> 33:38.460
the way they work together as a design

33:36.690 --> 33:40.919
is great getting right into the rough

33:38.460 --> 33:43.860
side of it both outlines really rough

33:40.919 --> 33:45.510
ulis your side that back leg those

33:43.860 --> 33:47.850
ripples and wobbles are the nervousness

33:45.510 --> 33:51.029
of those lines make the leg pretty

33:47.850 --> 33:53.100
misshapen Eavis outline looks a little

33:51.029 --> 33:54.659
heavier and bolder it also has quite a

33:53.100 --> 33:56.279
few areas of blow-ups around the top

33:54.659 --> 33:58.169
yeah that skin can be really tricky

33:56.279 --> 34:01.220
that's a technical application that's a

33:58.169 --> 34:01.220
mishap today big-time

34:02.010 --> 34:06.370
okay guys it's time to announce tattoo

34:04.750 --> 34:08.440
of the day there was a huge divide

34:06.370 --> 34:10.810
between partners today so how do we do

34:08.440 --> 34:12.969
this the strongest payers might be

34:10.810 --> 34:14.650
unkindness and pins and needles

34:12.969 --> 34:16.360
even though once way stronger than the

34:14.650 --> 34:18.010
other I'm gonna go on what I think is

34:16.360 --> 34:20.290
the best tattoo of the day and my vote

34:18.010 --> 34:22.719
is for Aaron which means my vote is for

34:20.290 --> 34:25.659
unkindness I greet my boat for

34:22.719 --> 34:27.429
unkindness gone with unkindness Hart the

34:25.659 --> 34:30.360
judges have decided that the best tattoo

34:27.429 --> 34:33.159
of the day goes to unkindness art

34:30.360 --> 34:35.469
congratulations all right guys as the

34:33.159 --> 34:38.199
jury of peers you must all deliberate

34:35.469 --> 34:40.179
and put one shop up for elimination head

34:38.199 --> 34:42.469
back to the loft

34:40.179 --> 34:44.449
[Music]

34:42.469 --> 34:46.369
need the I did a tattoo better than me

34:44.449 --> 34:48.049
even though there's was lighter and the

34:46.369 --> 34:50.000
Anatomy is messed up your boys tattoo

34:48.049 --> 34:53.030
had a lot more flaws in the line work

34:50.000 --> 34:55.639
both of y'all lines are you think that

34:53.030 --> 34:57.559
my line your lines are I don't agree

34:55.639 --> 34:58.849
with that I think that's true I don't

34:57.559 --> 35:00.440
think anybody said that that was true

34:58.849 --> 35:02.210
you're the older woman that has said

35:00.440 --> 35:03.619
that the judges said it each should both

35:02.210 --> 35:06.890
be outlook for y'all long did you say

35:03.619 --> 35:07.549
that about everybody except you about my

35:06.890 --> 35:09.710
lines

35:07.549 --> 35:12.109
some people are frustrated with you as

35:09.710 --> 35:18.589
you get your fustrated with me or not

35:12.109 --> 35:20.829
you're being obnoxious because you're

35:18.589 --> 35:23.000
obnoxious do that thank you

35:20.829 --> 35:24.710
if y'all want to send our respectful

35:23.000 --> 35:28.150
conversation we could do that I don't

35:24.710 --> 35:28.150
know if you're capable of that

35:28.470 --> 35:32.740
we asked you to vote on Twitter

35:30.790 --> 35:34.660
would you rather wear artistic skin

35:32.740 --> 35:36.700
designs or think before you inks

35:34.660 --> 35:38.380
cherub tattoo I would rather wear

35:36.700 --> 35:40.570
April's because I thought it was a

35:38.380 --> 35:42.580
better design and you voted artistic

35:40.570 --> 35:46.050
skin design following fester on Twitter

35:42.580 --> 35:46.050
and keep watching on Spike

35:48.630 --> 35:53.110
we're here as the jury appears to

35:51.310 --> 35:54.970
determine which shop will get sent down

35:53.110 --> 35:56.980
for elimination that shading on details

35:54.970 --> 35:58.750
has to be the worst of the day it's

35:56.980 --> 36:01.480
missing a bellybutton the line work is

35:58.750 --> 36:03.460
wobbly under the chin is really bad the

36:01.480 --> 36:05.800
hair at the top is blown out everybody

36:03.460 --> 36:08.170
here has blown out lines I think before

36:05.800 --> 36:10.510
you ink beats artistic skin designs

36:08.170 --> 36:16.090
because there's at least has one solid

36:10.510 --> 36:17.980
tattoo our tattoos don't add up to the

36:16.090 --> 36:20.290
inconsistencies in detached tattoo

36:17.980 --> 36:22.660
April's a tooth is the worst tattoo oh

36:20.290 --> 36:24.610
yeah you have a lot of shaky lines that

36:22.660 --> 36:26.080
all of the judges called out they also

36:24.610 --> 36:27.700
said there being a lot harder on us

36:26.080 --> 36:31.960
because we don't suck as much as you

36:27.700 --> 36:33.700
guys they were not horrible tattoos

36:31.960 --> 36:35.650
that's just being mean for the sake of

36:33.700 --> 36:37.390
being mean I said that the same way died

36:35.650 --> 36:39.310
he said I suck so I'm gonna defend my

36:37.390 --> 36:41.020
just I he defended his you're not gonna

36:39.310 --> 36:43.800
come at me and expect me to not come at

36:41.020 --> 36:46.990
y'all I'm not playing that game

36:43.800 --> 36:48.310
technical application rough day now

36:46.990 --> 36:50.590
we're getting a chance to see these

36:48.310 --> 36:52.270
people tattoo individually how do you

36:50.590 --> 36:54.370
think these guys did I think a perfect

36:52.270 --> 36:57.130
sample is made rich is shading in the

36:54.370 --> 36:59.530
tattoo is really nice but rich will end

36:57.130 --> 37:01.480
up sinking because his teammate can swim

36:59.530 --> 37:04.180
but also allegory arts was pretty

37:01.480 --> 37:05.980
challenged everything from the halo to

37:04.180 --> 37:08.020
the line work and they're rivaling

37:05.980 --> 37:09.370
tri-city I'll blow up and it's obvious

37:08.020 --> 37:10.810
that dave is a little bit stronger but

37:09.370 --> 37:12.580
still has problems it's gonna be

37:10.810 --> 37:15.010
interesting to see how the jury of peers

37:12.580 --> 37:16.880
is gonna vote here absolutely all right

37:15.010 --> 37:18.289
are you gonna

37:16.880 --> 37:20.119
I'm curious as to who they're gonna pick

37:18.289 --> 37:23.559
for the other two I don't think any of

37:20.119 --> 37:23.559
us were safe but you'll see

37:27.790 --> 37:31.380
all right jury appears who are y'all

37:29.920 --> 37:35.580
putting up for elimination

37:31.380 --> 37:35.580
Jerri appears has voted

37:36.890 --> 37:41.289
think before you ink for elimination all

37:39.739 --> 37:46.430
right we'll see think before you ain't

37:41.289 --> 37:49.460
tri-cities tattoo and allegory arts and

37:46.430 --> 37:52.310
everybody else downstairs

37:49.460 --> 37:55.780
Wow I did not see that comment holy I

37:52.310 --> 37:55.780
just want to get this is good

38:02.890 --> 38:06.640
today you tattooed black-and-gray

38:04.840 --> 38:10.150
cherubs testing your technical

38:06.640 --> 38:13.510
application based on your work one shop

38:10.150 --> 38:14.740
will be packing their machines time to

38:13.510 --> 38:16.780
hear from the jury appears

38:14.740 --> 38:19.530
guys why did you vote think before you

38:16.780 --> 38:19.530
ink to the bottom

38:20.369 --> 38:25.660
someone want to speak they feel like

38:23.200 --> 38:28.660
gchat stars application was very chunky

38:25.660 --> 38:30.820
we all didn't do a great tattoo DTaP

38:28.660 --> 38:33.190
your tattoo is one of the bottom tattoos

38:30.820 --> 38:35.350
of the day the shading is not smooth

38:33.190 --> 38:37.570
like Richards's it's a pretty large gap

38:35.350 --> 38:39.790
I think the flaws that we have in our

38:37.570 --> 38:41.860
tattoos are very minimal compared to the

38:39.790 --> 38:43.840
other two blowouts live on the bottom

38:41.860 --> 38:45.369
period no matter who you are there was a

38:43.840 --> 38:47.410
lot more blowouts in those times no

38:45.369 --> 38:50.470
there's not you can see a blowout in the

38:47.410 --> 38:52.420
top of deep at stars halo the hell out

38:50.470 --> 38:53.890
and it's built with solid black around I

38:52.420 --> 38:55.540
got two bad tattoos

38:53.890 --> 38:57.130
honestly guys I don't find these two

38:55.540 --> 38:59.260
tattoos amazing y'all were less

38:57.130 --> 39:01.510
challenged in the design but technically

38:59.260 --> 39:04.270
you Jack them up no one's brought up

39:01.510 --> 39:06.430
tri-cities tattoos tri-cities has equal

39:04.270 --> 39:08.440
amount of Bluffs bangs legs almost

39:06.430 --> 39:12.040
connect on a blow up there's blue

39:08.440 --> 39:14.410
bruising do you guys not see that it's

39:12.040 --> 39:15.760
been oh you've already had previous

39:14.410 --> 39:17.470
critiques and other tattoos about

39:15.760 --> 39:19.270
technical application today was the day

39:17.470 --> 39:21.250
to really hone in on it and not show us

39:19.270 --> 39:24.010
those mistakes we got caught up trying

39:21.250 --> 39:26.890
to like match our tattoo aesthetically

39:24.010 --> 39:29.800
and that ended up being why I had those

39:26.890 --> 39:31.720
blowout issues fellas time to determine

39:29.800 --> 39:34.869
who's going home the most appealing

39:31.720 --> 39:36.880
imagery is allegory arts the more

39:34.869 --> 39:39.730
consistent application between two

39:36.880 --> 39:40.960
artists also is salivary Arts in my mind

39:39.730 --> 39:43.600
allegory say from water

39:40.960 --> 39:46.240
you guys aren't going anywhere

39:43.600 --> 39:49.090
thank you guys so we're now between

39:46.240 --> 39:51.280
think before you ink tri-cities tattoo

39:49.090 --> 39:53.050
the best single application out of all

39:51.280 --> 39:54.970
four of these tattoos is made rich

39:53.050 --> 39:56.350
riches is better than detached but then

39:54.970 --> 39:58.180
if you go to tri-cities there's

39:56.350 --> 40:01.380
application problems on both sides of

39:58.180 --> 40:01.380
the fence no brainer for me

40:02.500 --> 40:07.329
tri-cities tattoo I get a go with

40:05.349 --> 40:09.910
tri-cities tattoo my votes for

40:07.329 --> 40:10.599
tri-cities tattoo the judges have

40:09.910 --> 40:13.059
decided

40:10.599 --> 40:16.059
tri-cities tattoo you do not have what

40:13.059 --> 40:18.160
it takes to be master shop exposing

40:16.059 --> 40:20.049
yourself in this environment is tough

40:18.160 --> 40:21.819
you guys are just out of phase where you

40:20.049 --> 40:25.480
need to grow more and then who knows

40:21.819 --> 40:29.130
maybe y'all be back please pack your

40:25.480 --> 40:29.130
machines and move out

40:29.460 --> 40:33.839
I'm man I don't want to go home I think

40:32.309 --> 40:36.030
we made some stupid mistakes

40:33.839 --> 40:38.450
everything we did needed to be done as a

40:36.030 --> 40:41.430
team everything should have been 5050

40:38.450 --> 40:43.079
that's where we failed they lie relieved

40:41.430 --> 40:46.140
people in the house that won't have

40:43.079 --> 40:48.540
another bank attack there will never in

40:46.140 --> 40:50.960
the history of inkmaster be another bank

40:48.540 --> 40:50.960
ever
