00:03.503 --> 00:04.545
Hey.

00:04.713 --> 00:06.171
Good morning, tiger.

00:06.339 --> 00:10.467
I'm making you a big breakfast, so you
can keep up your strength for tonight.

00:10.635 --> 00:13.345
You're gonna get me
good and pregnant.

00:14.514 --> 00:17.391
I've got nowhere to go this morning.
I'm unemployed.

00:17.559 --> 00:19.643
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with my life.

00:19.811 --> 00:22.646
Well, I just lost my erection.

00:23.189 --> 00:25.858
No, I mean, what am I supposed
to do with myself?

00:26.026 --> 00:28.277
You're supposed to find
your passion in life.

00:28.445 --> 00:31.405
You can be whatever you want
to be now. It's exciting.

00:31.573 --> 00:34.658
Yeah, but it's all so overwhelming.
I don't know where to start.

00:34.826 --> 00:37.703
Hey, wait a second.
I can help you with this.

00:37.871 --> 00:41.915
You just need to be organized. We can
make a list of your qualifications...

00:42.083 --> 00:48.005
...and categorize jobs by industry.
There could be folders and files...

00:48.173 --> 00:52.885
Hey, this is where your hyper-organized
pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.762
I know!

00:55.638 --> 00:57.723
My erection is back!

01:37.555 --> 01:38.639
Thank you.

01:38.807 --> 01:42.017
Ooh, Joey, could I have a sip
of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?

01:42.185 --> 01:44.520
- Okay.
- Thank you.

01:51.402 --> 01:53.237
Thank you.

01:54.405 --> 01:58.450
Uh, Pheebs, have you ever been bitten
by a hungry Italian?

01:59.410 --> 02:02.371
I'm sorry.
It's just, I'm a little short on cash.

02:02.539 --> 02:04.706
Oh, if you want,
I could loan you some money.

02:04.874 --> 02:07.751
Oh, no, no, no. I learned never to
borrow money from friends.

02:07.919 --> 02:11.839
No. That's why Richard Dreyfuss
and I don't speak anymore.

02:13.049 --> 02:16.385
Ooh, hey, how about this?
Wanna be an extra on my show?

02:16.553 --> 02:18.011
- You could do that?
- Yeah, yeah.

02:18.179 --> 02:21.431
The pay's pretty good, and you
could do it for as long as you need.

02:21.599 --> 02:24.935
- Oh, my God. I'm gonna be on TV!
- Okay, now...

02:25.103 --> 02:28.981
I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't
as glamorous and exciting as you think.

02:29.149 --> 02:32.651
- Oh, really?
- No, it is awesome.

02:33.194 --> 02:34.236
Hey, guys.

02:34.404 --> 02:35.988
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.281
Oh, wow.

02:37.448 --> 02:38.949
Hey, why are you all dressed up?

02:39.117 --> 02:43.662
We're bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren
today to introduce her to everyone.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.956
- Doesn't she look cute?
- She sure does.

02:46.124 --> 02:48.709
Why does she have a pink bow
taped to her head?

02:48.877 --> 02:51.378
If one more person says,
"What a cute little boy"...

02:51.546 --> 02:54.214
...I'm gonna whip them
with a car antenna.

02:54.841 --> 02:57.342
I think she's gonna be
the hit of the office, huh?

02:57.510 --> 03:01.847
Yeah, she's gonna be hotter than,
uh, peasant blouses and A-line skirts.

03:03.516 --> 03:05.517
Can I get a blue bow?

03:08.605 --> 03:11.356
Okay. I have looked through
a bunch of career guides...

03:11.524 --> 03:13.775
...photocopied and highlighted
key passages...

03:13.943 --> 03:17.905
...and put them into alphabetical folders,
so you can make an informed decision.

03:19.407 --> 03:21.617
How long was I in there?

03:22.577 --> 03:25.537
Okay, let's start with the A's.
Advertising.

03:26.122 --> 03:29.625
Wait. Advertising, that's a great idea.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.295
Well, don't you wanna
look through the rest?

03:34.380 --> 03:38.008
I don't think I have to hear the rest.
Advertising makes perfect sense.

03:38.176 --> 03:40.344
I'm sorry you had to waste all this time.

03:40.511 --> 03:43.138
You call eight hours alone
with my label maker wasted time?

03:44.557 --> 03:46.934
Ooh, now I'll get to use my shredder!

03:47.560 --> 03:51.438
I mean, I could write slogans.
I mean, how hard could it be, right?

03:51.773 --> 03:53.190
"Cheese.

03:53.358 --> 03:56.777
It's milk that you chew."

03:59.697 --> 04:04.451
"Crackers. Because your cheese
needs a buddy."

04:04.911 --> 04:09.331
"A grape. Because who can get
a watermelon in your mouth?"

04:10.458 --> 04:11.708
Oh, I got one.

04:11.876 --> 04:16.088
"Socks. Because your family's feet
deserve the best."

04:16.255 --> 04:17.798
Honey, leave it to the pros.

04:19.341 --> 04:21.301
I actually know someone
in advertising.

04:21.469 --> 04:24.388
I grew up with a guy who is
a vice president at a big agency.

04:24.555 --> 04:27.140
Maybe I can get him to meet you.
Give me the phone.

04:27.308 --> 04:32.646
"The phone. Bringing you closer
to people who have phones."

04:33.815 --> 04:36.441
"Marriage. It's not for everybody."

04:40.655 --> 04:44.324
That went well. Almost everybody
knew that she was a girl.

04:44.492 --> 04:47.995
Yeah, after you punched that one guy
who got it wrong, word spread.

04:49.122 --> 04:52.040
I'm just gonna go in my office
and pick up some stuff.

04:55.503 --> 04:58.088
- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you?

04:58.256 --> 05:01.300
I'm the hell person
whose office this is.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.635
Good one, Rach.

05:04.470 --> 05:07.639
I'm Gavin Mitchell,
the person who's taking over your job.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.057
Excuse me?

05:09.225 --> 05:11.935
Oh, your baby's so cute.

05:13.354 --> 05:16.356
But why would you put
a pink bow on a boy?

05:21.195 --> 05:23.613
Hey, Joey. Look at me.

05:23.781 --> 05:25.157
I'm a nurse.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.658
- Yes, you are.
- Ha, ha.

05:26.826 --> 05:28.994
I think it might be time
for my sponge bath.

05:29.912 --> 05:33.081
Sorry, I'm just so used
to hitting on the extras.

05:33.249 --> 05:36.793
- So are you excited about your scene?
- Yeah, but I'm a little nervous.

05:36.961 --> 05:40.714
Oh, relax. Don't be. They'll probably
just make you stand in the background.

05:40.882 --> 05:43.508
- Good.
- You. Here, come here. Here.

05:44.302 --> 05:47.804
Take this tray, stand on this yellow
mark. You're gonna move on "action."

05:47.972 --> 05:51.725
Walk over to the operating table, stop on
the blue mark and put the tray down.

05:51.893 --> 05:53.518
Don't walk too fast.

05:54.103 --> 05:56.104
But don't dawdle.

05:56.981 --> 05:59.024
Okay. Now, what?

05:59.817 --> 06:03.362
And, action!

06:08.868 --> 06:10.160
- Cut! Cut.
- I'm sorry.

06:10.328 --> 06:13.580
- I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.
- Yeah, well, don't be.

06:14.082 --> 06:16.291
Okay, that helps.

06:17.293 --> 06:20.045
And, action!

06:23.800 --> 06:25.217
Cut!

06:25.385 --> 06:28.053
Don't worry about it.
It usually takes me three takes too.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.639
Ha-ha-ha. All right, eight.

06:31.974 --> 06:35.185
And...

06:35.353 --> 06:36.937
...action!

06:54.872 --> 06:57.374
So do you have any other
questions about advertising?

06:57.542 --> 07:01.002
No. No. But let me show you
what I can do.

07:01.921 --> 07:04.297
"Bagels and doughnuts.

07:04.465 --> 07:08.343
Round food for every mood."

07:09.720 --> 07:12.305
Monica warned me you might do that.

07:14.183 --> 07:16.768
I think we might have something
for you at the agency.

07:16.936 --> 07:19.896
- Really? That's great.
- It's an unpaid internship.

07:22.650 --> 07:26.736
That's funny. When you said "unpaid,"
it sounded like you said "unpaid."

07:27.155 --> 07:29.322
Come on, now. Monica has a good job.

07:29.490 --> 07:31.491
It's not like you have
a family to support.

07:31.659 --> 07:35.579
Actually, we're trying. I don't think
Monica is gonna want to postpone it.

07:35.746 --> 07:37.414
We're supposed to have sex tonight.

07:38.791 --> 07:41.877
Actually, she's probably at home,
naked right now.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.382
I tend to keep talking
till somebody stops me.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.219
- I can picture her on the bed.
- Stop!

07:51.387 --> 07:52.888
Okay.

07:54.557 --> 07:57.184
Wait. What do you mean,
you're taking over my job?

07:57.351 --> 08:00.437
Well, while you were on your
baby vacation, I was doing your job.

08:00.605 --> 08:03.773
A vacation? My idea
of a vacation does not involve...

08:03.941 --> 08:08.028
...something sucking on my nipples
until they are raw.

08:08.946 --> 08:12.073
Clearly, you've never been
to Sandals Paradise Island.

08:15.745 --> 08:19.372
All right. Don't get too comfortable
there, because I'm back in two weeks.

08:19.540 --> 08:21.374
I want everything back the way it was.

08:21.542 --> 08:25.045
I can't say I care too much for the way
you've rearranged my office.

08:25.213 --> 08:28.048
I can't say I care too much
for that smell you've brought in.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.341
Excuse me?

08:29.509 --> 08:33.595
Uh, Rach, uh,
we have a code brown situation.

08:34.429 --> 08:37.224
Honey, could you please
take care of it for me?

08:37.933 --> 08:41.061
All right, but you're gonna
have to do one sometime.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.273
Let me just get this straight.

08:45.441 --> 08:48.777
So I go have a baby, and they send
some guy in to do my job?

08:48.945 --> 08:52.113
Well, there was talk of shutting down
Ralph Lauren altogether.

08:52.281 --> 08:54.908
Okay. Right.
You're very cheeky for a temp.

08:55.076 --> 08:58.453
I'm not a temp. I was transferred here
from another department.

08:58.621 --> 09:02.249
Oh, and what department was that?
The, uh, jerk department?

09:02.416 --> 09:04.292
They didn't tell me
about your quick wit.

09:04.460 --> 09:07.128
Well, did they mention that
I'm rubber and you're glue?

09:08.673 --> 09:12.133
- Gavin, Ralph loved your ideas.
- Oh, hi, Mr. Zelner.

09:12.301 --> 09:14.761
Ah, Rachel. I see you've met Gavin.

09:14.929 --> 09:17.931
When you left us, we weren't sure
what we were gonna do.

09:18.099 --> 09:22.018
But then, Gavin to the rescue.
Super Gavin. Ha-ha-ha.

09:23.145 --> 09:24.604
Well, that's great.

09:24.772 --> 09:27.649
So now, uh, Super Gavin,
when I come back...

09:27.817 --> 09:31.319
...uh, where do you plan
on flying off to?

09:31.529 --> 09:34.698
That's up to Mr. Zelner.
I'm sure he'll make the right decision.

09:34.865 --> 09:38.201
Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power.

09:39.203 --> 09:41.580
Incidentally,
when, uh, are you coming back?

09:42.748 --> 09:44.165
Uh, today.

09:44.333 --> 09:48.420
- You said two weeks.
- No, I said today.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.673
See, for a superhero,
not so much with the listening.

09:55.761 --> 09:56.803
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.013
So, what'd he say?

09:58.180 --> 09:59.347
Uh...

09:59.515 --> 10:01.683
He can be a little rough
around the edges...

10:01.851 --> 10:06.855
...so I'm gonna replace a word
he used a lot with the word "puppy."

10:08.232 --> 10:13.403
Okay? So he said, "If your puppy friend
doesn't get her puppy act together...

10:13.571 --> 10:16.698
...I am gonna fire
her mother-puppy ass."

10:17.533 --> 10:20.577
I'm sorry. I can't do this.
I'm just not an actor.

10:20.745 --> 10:23.163
That's right. You're not. You're a nurse.

10:23.331 --> 10:25.832
- You're Nurse With Tray.
- Joey...

10:26.000 --> 10:29.002
Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey.
She has no time for friends.

10:29.170 --> 10:32.714
She gets in that operating room
and she carries that tray to the doctor...

10:32.882 --> 10:35.050
...because if she doesn't, people die.

10:35.217 --> 10:36.843
Who dies?

10:37.011 --> 10:38.928
Man With Eye Patch!

10:39.096 --> 10:41.556
Now, you get in there,
and you do your job.

10:41.724 --> 10:42.849
- Yes, doctor.
- Okay.

10:44.727 --> 10:47.646
Okay, let's try this one more time.

10:47.813 --> 10:51.650
Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch.
Your tray is coming.

10:53.527 --> 10:56.905
And, action.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.204
Yes, I did it! I nailed it!

11:04.372 --> 11:05.413
Whoo!

11:05.581 --> 11:06.665
What's next?

11:06.832 --> 11:09.250
The rest of the scene.

11:11.003 --> 11:12.879
Okay, from the top, people.

11:20.012 --> 11:23.139
Listen, sudden change of plans.
Um, my maternity leave just ended.

11:23.307 --> 11:26.059
They said if I didn't
come back today, they'd fire me.

11:26.268 --> 11:28.186
What? No, that's illegal.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.980
I'll have the Labor Department
here so fast, they won't...

11:31.190 --> 11:36.903
All right, calm down, Norma Rae.
They didn't actually say that.

11:37.071 --> 11:41.157
I'm just afraid if I don't come back now,
this guy will try and squeeze me out.

11:41.325 --> 11:44.703
But what about Emma?
I mean, we don't have a nanny.

11:44.870 --> 11:47.914
I know. We're just gonna have
to figure out a plan tonight.

11:48.082 --> 11:50.542
Can you please just take care
of her for today?

11:50.710 --> 11:54.546
Absolutely. Just give me your breasts,
and we'll be on our way.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.591
Come on.
I don't know what else to do.

11:59.593 --> 12:02.178
- Fine. Fine.
- Okay.

12:02.346 --> 12:06.599
We'll have fun, won't we?
Yes, we will. Yes, we...

12:11.313 --> 12:13.523
- Ross.
- Huh?

12:15.025 --> 12:16.568
You're pretty.

12:22.742 --> 12:26.578
Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be
starting a new career from scratch.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.706
It's gonna be a while
before I make a living at it.

12:29.874 --> 12:34.419
Maybe now's not the right time
to be starting a family.

12:34.587 --> 12:38.673
So you have to tell Monica you don't
want to have a baby right now?

12:39.175 --> 12:40.383
Yeah.

12:42.261 --> 12:43.678
Goodbye.

12:47.600 --> 12:51.227
Okay, it's baby time. Pants off, Bing.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.064
Didn't see you there, Geller.

12:56.484 --> 12:59.027
Yeah, Ross is here, so...

13:00.154 --> 13:01.780
Uh, yeah, uh-huh. Yeah.

13:01.947 --> 13:05.283
Uh, and I was really hoping
that maybe I could hang out.

13:05.451 --> 13:09.537
- Mm.
- What do you, uh, feel like doing?

13:10.623 --> 13:13.041
Well, uh, we're gonna have sex.

13:13.626 --> 13:16.294
I don't feel like having sex.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.381
Uh, maybe, uh... I don't know.

13:20.549 --> 13:23.092
Maybe we can
watch a movie or something.

13:23.260 --> 13:24.594
Uh, let me put it this way:

13:24.762 --> 13:27.472
We're having sex
whether you're here or not.

13:28.182 --> 13:30.016
Pants off, Bing.

13:34.313 --> 13:38.942
Now that I'm back, why don't you just
fill me in on what you've been up to?

13:39.109 --> 13:43.071
Well, I've changed your screen saver
from that picture of *NSYNC.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.031
Hey, they were popular when I left.

13:46.158 --> 13:48.785
I'm working on this
big presentation for tomorrow.

13:48.953 --> 13:51.579
I should be involved in that,
so get me up to speed.

13:51.747 --> 13:54.624
That'll take weeks.
Let me take care of the presentation.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.960
Oh, no. I see what you're
doing here, all right?

13:57.127 --> 14:01.673
This is my job, buddy. I've had it for
five years, and I know how it works.

14:01.841 --> 14:05.051
- So why don't you just catch me up?
- Fine.

14:06.011 --> 14:09.639
Oh, God. You've totally messed
with the back support on my chair.

14:09.807 --> 14:12.141
- How do you fix this?
- You've been here five years.

14:12.309 --> 14:15.311
- You figure it out.
- Fine, I will.

14:22.403 --> 14:23.987
All right, fill me in.

14:29.702 --> 14:30.952
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:31.120 --> 14:34.789
Do you have a blue tie that would go
with this? Emma spit up on mine.

14:34.957 --> 14:37.667
Oh, yeah, but you have to give it back
if I get a job.

14:37.835 --> 14:40.253
Of course, by that time,
ties will be obsolete...

14:40.421 --> 14:42.714
...and we'll all be wearing
silver jumpsuits.

14:45.175 --> 14:47.010
- Hey, good morning, lover.
- Hey.

14:47.177 --> 14:50.805
I gotta say, after last night,
I'm a little weak in the knees.

14:53.934 --> 14:58.646
Here's an idea. You walk into a room,
take a quick scan.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.317
Sorry.

15:02.484 --> 15:06.154
But I kind of have this feeling that
we may have made a baby last night.

15:07.114 --> 15:11.034
Oh, God, I have to tell you something.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.453
You're not pregnant.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.204
What are you talking about?

15:15.372 --> 15:18.666
Well, that thing that I have to do
to make a baby?

15:18.834 --> 15:20.251
I faked it.

15:21.003 --> 15:23.379
What? You faked it?

15:24.423 --> 15:26.341
You know what?

15:28.093 --> 15:30.303
I don't need a tie.

15:31.639 --> 15:35.308
I mean, it's...
It's better open collar, you know?

15:35.476 --> 15:39.687
It's, uh, ahem, it's more casual.

15:45.527 --> 15:48.613
Joey. Listen, I can't do this.
It doesn't make any sense.

15:48.781 --> 15:52.700
Yesterday I was a nurse,
and today I'm a waitress at a café?

15:52.868 --> 15:56.371
Oh, sometimes we use the same extras
for different parts. It's okay.

15:56.538 --> 16:01.167
Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very
memorable performance as the nurse.

16:01.335 --> 16:05.922
And now, suddenly, I'm the waitress?
That's gonna confuse my fans.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.132
Um, um...

16:08.300 --> 16:11.678
Well, maybe you are a nurse...

16:11.845 --> 16:15.473
...but you moonlight as a waitress.

16:16.058 --> 16:18.101
Oh.

16:18.268 --> 16:19.811
Uh-huh.

16:19.979 --> 16:23.398
Because I'm a single mother
supporting my two children.

16:23.857 --> 16:25.733
- Nice. Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:26.443 --> 16:28.319
Okay. Wait a minute.

16:28.487 --> 16:33.074
Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the
same hospital. Wouldn't I come say hi?

16:33.242 --> 16:37.328
No. No, see, uh,
you and Drake are having a fight.

16:37.496 --> 16:38.955
About what?

16:39.123 --> 16:42.291
He slept with you
and then never called you.

16:43.544 --> 16:46.212
And I just wanted a new daddy
for Davey and Becky.

16:46.380 --> 16:47.422
Okay.

16:49.216 --> 16:51.342
Okay. Okay, from the top.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.679
And, action.

16:54.847 --> 16:58.141
So I'm surprised you agreed
to have lunch with me.

16:58.308 --> 17:00.768
I'm surprised too. But yet, here I am.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.021
Cut! Cut!

17:04.815 --> 17:06.315
What...? What are you doing?

17:06.483 --> 17:10.694
I'm very angry at him because he slept
with me and never called me back.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.905
- Me too.
- Me too!

17:14.116 --> 17:16.284
Oh, calm down.
She means on the show.

17:16.452 --> 17:19.244
We need some new extras
around here.

17:22.750 --> 17:25.167
Wow. You're here already.

17:25.335 --> 17:29.130
Yes. Emma and I came in a little early
to do research on the presentation.

17:29.298 --> 17:32.633
Actually, I made a few changes.
I think I'm caught up on everything.

17:32.801 --> 17:34.844
So ask me anything.

17:35.012 --> 17:38.139
- How do you fix the chair?
- Ugh, except that!

17:39.141 --> 17:43.644
Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We are all ready
for our presentation this afternoon.

17:43.812 --> 17:48.566
- Good, because it's in 10 minutes.
- What? I can't do that. I have the baby.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.985
Ross is not gonna pick her up
for an hour.

17:51.153 --> 17:53.988
Then Gavin can give the presentation.
We have to do it now.

17:54.156 --> 17:58.826
Ralph needs to leave early today.
He's going helicopter shopping. Heh.

18:00.996 --> 18:03.081
Well, there you go, you win. You win.

18:03.248 --> 18:06.042
You get to do the presentation.
You'll knock them dead.

18:06.251 --> 18:10.213
No one will remember that I worked here,
and then Ralph will buy his helicopter...

18:10.380 --> 18:14.092
...and Super Gavin will just fly
right alongside of him.

18:18.931 --> 18:22.183
- You can do the presentation.
- No, I can't. I have a baby.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.477
I'll watch her.

18:26.605 --> 18:27.814
Why would you do that?

18:28.315 --> 18:32.151
Because you worked really hard, and
it's your job. And you're a little crazy.

18:34.029 --> 18:35.780
That's really nice.

18:36.406 --> 18:39.909
I should tell you that crying women
make me very uncomfortable.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.620
Well, you're not gonna like
what's coming.

18:45.999 --> 18:48.751
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

18:49.253 --> 18:50.545
God.

18:50.712 --> 18:53.131
Thank you. Thank you.

18:54.550 --> 18:55.883
Um.

18:56.051 --> 18:57.718
Okay.

18:59.096 --> 19:02.515
I'm really fine. Don't worry.
I'm great with children.

19:04.059 --> 19:05.852
Okay.

19:13.360 --> 19:16.112
Gavin Mitchell. Pleased to meet you.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.658
Please don't fire my friend.
Just let me talk to her.

19:20.826 --> 19:23.619
- Okay, but this is her last chance.
- Thank you.

19:23.787 --> 19:25.413
How about I do something for you?

19:25.581 --> 19:28.875
Tomorrow, uh, I'll bring you a hat,
cover up the bald.

19:33.797 --> 19:36.883
Hey, uh, listen, Pheebs.
I was just talking to the director...

19:37.050 --> 19:39.886
...and he was thinking maybe
this time you don't hit Drake.

19:40.053 --> 19:41.679
You just wait on the tables.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.891
I can't do that. I'm an actor.
I have a process.

19:45.058 --> 19:47.768
You're a masseuse.
You have a table with a hole in it.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.565
Wait, I see what's happening here.
You're threatened.

19:52.733 --> 19:53.900
What?

19:54.067 --> 19:57.361
I'm so good in the scene
that I'm stealing focus from you.

19:57.529 --> 20:00.823
Well, rise to the challenge, Tribbiani,
because I just raised the bar.

20:00.991 --> 20:04.535
- Come join me up here.
- Ha-ha-ha.

20:07.080 --> 20:10.750
Yeah, you can fire her, but I would
call security. She won't go easy.

20:13.503 --> 20:16.589
You faked it?
You couldn't have faked it.

20:16.757 --> 20:20.801
Yes, you can. You just make
the faces and the noises.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.013
Guys can fake it?

20:24.181 --> 20:27.600
Ugh, unbelievable.
The one thing that's ours.

20:30.270 --> 20:33.064
Why would you fake it
when we're trying to have a baby?

20:33.232 --> 20:35.942
Well, that's actually why.

20:37.319 --> 20:39.111
Look, I'm starting
a whole new career now.

20:39.279 --> 20:40.947
I'm not saying I don't want a baby.

20:41.114 --> 20:43.950
I'm just saying maybe
we could wait a little while.

20:44.868 --> 20:46.494
Like...? Like a month?

20:47.287 --> 20:50.665
- Or a year?
- Really? You wanna wait a year?

20:50.832 --> 20:53.834
It could be less than a year.
I mean, you've heard my stuff.

20:54.002 --> 20:58.965
"Pants. Like shorts but longer."

21:02.094 --> 21:04.428
It'll probably be more than a year.

21:06.014 --> 21:07.473
Wow. I...

21:07.641 --> 21:11.811
- I really wanna have a baby.
- Well, yeah, me too.

21:14.648 --> 21:17.942
Look, I'll just get my old job back.

21:18.151 --> 21:20.653
No, I want you to have
a job that you love...

21:20.821 --> 21:24.365
...not statistical analysis
and data reconfiguration.

21:24.533 --> 21:27.285
I quit, and you learn what I do?

21:30.122 --> 21:34.041
I think there's never gonna be
a right time to have a baby.

21:34.209 --> 21:36.460
Now you're unemployed,
and in a little while...

21:36.628 --> 21:39.755
...you'll find a new job
that'll keep you really busy.

21:39.923 --> 21:42.550
There's always gonna be
a reason not to do this...

21:42.718 --> 21:46.887
...but I think once the baby comes,
we'll forget about all those reasons.

21:48.390 --> 21:50.099
I guess.

21:50.267 --> 21:53.185
I mean, it's always gonna be scary
when we have a baby.

21:53.353 --> 21:55.813
It's gonna be really scary.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.691
I mean, God, when we have a baby...

21:58.859 --> 22:02.653
...there's gonna be so much
that we're not able to control.

22:03.196 --> 22:07.199
I mean, the apartment's
gonna be a mess.

22:07.367 --> 22:09.660
I won't have time to clean it.

22:10.704 --> 22:13.331
What if the baby gets
into the ribbon drawer...

22:13.498 --> 22:16.167
...and messes up all the ribbons?

22:16.460 --> 22:18.627
What if there's no room
for a ribbon drawer...

22:18.795 --> 22:21.255
...because the baby's stuff
takes up all the space?

22:21.423 --> 22:23.591
Where will all the ribbons go?

22:24.760 --> 22:27.261
Should we go make a baby
before you change your mind?

22:27.429 --> 22:29.221
- Yes, please!
- Okay.

22:29.389 --> 22:32.350
Oh, and I promise I will not
fake it this time.

22:32.517 --> 22:35.770
Well, I wish I could say the same.
I'm a little shook up.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.694
I know you botched
that operation on purpose.

22:43.862 --> 22:48.074
I can't prove it yet, but when I do,
you'll be going to jail for murder.

22:48.241 --> 22:49.909
I don't care if you are my brother.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.912
I'm not your brother.

22:53.121 --> 22:55.164
What about my children, Drake? Huh?

22:55.332 --> 22:58.292
No! No! No!

22:59.294 --> 23:00.753
No! No!

23:01.963 --> 23:03.756
God!
