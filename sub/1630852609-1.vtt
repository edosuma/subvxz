WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.003
- [Lashauwn] This is not
RuPaul's Best Friend Race!

00:03.003 --> 00:04.271
- [Laganja] I feel very
attacked!

00:04.271 --> 00:06.240
- [Kandy] If you don't have star
quality,

00:06.240 --> 00:07.908
get the fuck out of here!

00:07.908 --> 00:09.543
- [Elliott] Oh my god.

00:09.543 --> 00:10.777
(upbeat music)

00:10.777 --> 00:12.813
- [RuPaul] This is "Untucked,"

00:12.813 --> 00:14.448
backstage at the competition

00:14.448 --> 00:17.951
to become America's next drag
superstar.

00:17.951 --> 00:20.354
Girl, if you're not watching
"Untucked,"

00:20.354 --> 00:22.589
you're only getting half the
story.

00:22.589 --> 00:23.957
(dramatic music)

00:23.957 --> 00:25.659
- [Crew] Let's break on the main
stage.

00:25.659 --> 00:26.627
All cameras, re-po.

00:28.095 --> 00:30.430
- [RuPaul] Thank you, ladies,
I think we've heard enough.

00:30.430 --> 00:32.399
While you untuck in the Werk
Room,

00:32.399 --> 00:34.434
the judges and I will
deliberate.

00:35.302 --> 00:36.503
You may leave the stage.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.574
- [Kornbread] This is
the premiere of season 14

00:40.574 --> 00:42.175
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

00:42.175 --> 00:43.010
This is a monumental moment.

00:43.010 --> 00:46.313
I'm hoping I'm making
everybody proud by being here.

00:46.313 --> 00:47.981
I ain't getting no sleep
tonight.

00:48.815 --> 00:49.983
I'm really fighting.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.553
- [Alyssa] It's a dream to be
here on "RuPaul's Drag Race"

00:53.553 --> 00:55.522
since I was a little boy.

00:55.522 --> 00:58.558
This is an opportunity to
show the world who I am

00:58.558 --> 01:00.661
and the artist that lives in me.

01:02.462 --> 01:04.531
- [Orion] It's important to
impress the judges right now,

01:04.531 --> 01:07.267
because this is the first
challenge.

01:07.267 --> 01:09.836
The first impression
they're gonna have of you.

01:11.038 --> 01:12.906
- [Bosco] I'm feeling really
good.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.675
I'm just hoping it's enough

01:14.675 --> 01:17.644
'cause this is the apex of the
Olympics

01:17.644 --> 01:19.613
of the "Hunger Games" of drag.

01:19.613 --> 01:22.149
And I want to show what I can
do.

01:26.887 --> 01:28.555
- [Crew] Queens walking.

01:28.555 --> 01:31.758
- [Crew Member] Send the
queens in three, two, one.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.827
- I gotta come in sideways,
child.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.630
Ooh.
- Baby.

01:36.630 --> 01:39.366
- There are cocktails, alright.

01:39.366 --> 01:42.069
- Ooh, little beverages!

01:42.069 --> 01:43.103
- Ooh!

01:43.103 --> 01:43.937
- Ugh!
- I can't walk,

01:43.937 --> 01:45.339
or feel any of my god damn feet.

01:45.339 --> 01:47.407
- Can somebody help me open
this?

01:47.407 --> 01:50.043
(Kornbread grunting)

01:50.043 --> 01:51.378
- That's was something, girl.

01:51.378 --> 01:53.180
- Bitch, we walked on
the mother fucking stage

01:53.180 --> 01:54.848
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."
- Oh my god.

01:54.848 --> 01:56.717
- It was so crazy.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.352
- This entire fucking process so
far

01:58.352 --> 02:00.354
has felt like a god damn dream.

02:00.354 --> 02:02.556
- It was outer body.
- It's fucking next.

02:02.556 --> 02:05.659
- Literally.
- Every step I was taking,

02:05.659 --> 02:07.561
I was just like, girl,

02:07.561 --> 02:09.830
these bitches can't take you.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.265
- I'm lucid dreaming every night
about,

02:12.265 --> 02:13.900
like, being here.
- Oh damn.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.602
- So I'm like having trouble

02:15.602 --> 02:17.170
deciphering which is reality

02:17.170 --> 02:18.605
and which is the dream.

02:18.605 --> 02:19.973
- You're here, baby.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.241
- And there's not many chances
you get

02:21.241 --> 02:22.843
to stand in front of your
mother fucking idol, bitch.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.177
- She loved you.
- In front of

02:24.177 --> 02:25.345
motherfucking Lizzo, bitch.

02:25.345 --> 02:27.914
- Lizzo's gonna be,
like, your biggest fan.

02:27.914 --> 02:29.950
You were wearing her costume.

02:30.851 --> 02:31.852
- You heard what RuPaul said.

02:31.852 --> 02:34.321
She said, bitch, that outfit
look good.

02:34.321 --> 02:35.889
And she's correct.

02:35.889 --> 02:38.825
But it was like, I
performed a song of my own.

02:38.825 --> 02:39.659
- That's smart.

02:39.659 --> 02:40.660
- And they, I mean,

02:40.660 --> 02:41.495
from what they can understand

02:41.495 --> 02:42.662
'cause I'm a country hoe,

02:42.662 --> 02:44.031
and all the Black people got it.

02:44.031 --> 02:46.633
- Shangela cut crease, I got it!

02:46.633 --> 02:48.268
- You might be in the top.

02:48.268 --> 02:50.337
I love, you know, the
unique kind of thing,

02:50.337 --> 02:52.472
without the wig, you know, bald.

02:52.472 --> 02:54.174
Black, big, ghe-, you know.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.842
- All of that, ghetto, baby, say
it.

02:55.842 --> 02:56.676
Don't fucking

02:56.676 --> 02:58.045
I'm hood as fuck.

02:58.045 --> 02:59.946
- I love that you said that on
stage, too.

02:59.946 --> 03:00.981
You're like, I'm hood as fuck.

03:00.981 --> 03:02.682
I don't cry.
- I don't, bitch.

03:02.682 --> 03:03.817
And that's the gag.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.052
I felt them tears coming on.

03:05.052 --> 03:06.153
- That's was beautiful.
- I'm going,

03:06.153 --> 03:06.987
"Don't do it, bitch.

03:06.987 --> 03:07.821
Don't do it, bitch."

03:07.821 --> 03:08.655
- She's human.

03:08.655 --> 03:09.790
- People back home are
gonna know I'm human now.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.758
- That was your moment.

03:11.758 --> 03:13.960
- They surely were not
fucking around tonight,

03:13.960 --> 03:15.762
as far as critiques went.
- They were all...

03:15.762 --> 03:18.065
- That was not first episode
critiques.

03:18.065 --> 03:19.566
- There's not 14 of us standing
there.

03:19.566 --> 03:20.934
It's seven of us.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.369
- They got the eyeballs to see
all of us.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.905
- Including big holes
in the back of your ass.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.173
(shady music)

03:26.173 --> 03:27.607
- Don't talk about me like that.

03:27.607 --> 03:28.442
(laughing)

03:28.442 --> 03:30.777
- Well, you did amazing.

03:30.777 --> 03:31.912
- Thank you.

03:31.912 --> 03:34.748
I'm feeling real good.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.349
- I feel like y'all are the
tops.

03:36.349 --> 03:37.918
- First time for
everything, baby, you know?

03:37.918 --> 03:39.019
(laughing)

03:39.019 --> 03:40.554
- You'd be surprised.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.155
You'd be surprised.

03:42.155 --> 03:43.790
- You get great critiques.

03:43.790 --> 03:44.791
They loved your performance.
- Really good.

03:44.791 --> 03:46.159
- Your look.
- They like,

03:46.159 --> 03:47.627
understand my perspective,

03:47.627 --> 03:48.962
the story that I'm telling.

03:48.962 --> 03:50.764
And they're like, okay we're
impressed.

03:50.764 --> 03:53.667
Which is like, a bit intense.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.202
But, I'm like the first person
to be on

03:55.202 --> 03:57.938
from Seattle in like, eight
years?

03:57.938 --> 04:00.440
- Damn.
- And we have a fucking

04:00.440 --> 04:03.543
giants from Seattle that
have done this competition.

04:03.543 --> 04:06.913
Jinkx and Ben, they set the
paces for their seasons.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.415
- People still talk about
it even to this day.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.283
That's legend shit.
- Right?

04:10.283 --> 04:11.751
- And like, I feel like
I'm living up to that.

04:11.751 --> 04:15.188
And that's makes me ecstatic.

04:15.188 --> 04:16.623
- See, y'all have got
some good fucking drag.

04:16.623 --> 04:17.858
- We got some of the best in the
world.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.826
- It's that damn coffee
y'all got over there, bitch.

04:19.826 --> 04:20.660
(laughing)

04:20.660 --> 04:22.095
- I've been working in a cafe,

04:22.095 --> 04:24.631
so the only critique that I've
gotten is,

04:24.631 --> 04:26.533
this was supposed to be iced.

04:26.533 --> 04:29.136
So, to like, have like
a full panel of people

04:29.136 --> 04:30.971
tell me nothing but nice things,

04:30.971 --> 04:32.839
like, I'm on cloud nine.

04:32.839 --> 04:34.875
- Miss Kerri, baby.
- Hi!

04:35.942 --> 04:36.910
- What's tea, honey?

04:36.910 --> 04:38.078
Over there looking all good.

04:38.078 --> 04:38.912
- I would say, like,

04:38.912 --> 04:40.347
I felt like I fell in the
middle.

04:40.347 --> 04:42.816
- Okay.
- Which isn't my favorite,

04:42.816 --> 04:45.152
but I think given the
circumstances,

04:45.152 --> 04:47.087
I'm grateful to be there.

04:47.087 --> 04:51.291
I don't necessarily feel
like I got, like, torn apart.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.226
- You're gonna have to
sell these shoes to RuPaul.

04:53.226 --> 04:54.394
- Yep.

04:54.394 --> 04:59.032
- My favorite part of it
are those brown boots.

04:59.032 --> 05:02.102
Exquisite. Just wonderful.

05:02.102 --> 05:04.404
- We might have to get
them adjusted a little bit.

05:04.404 --> 05:06.239
- What are you trying to say?

05:06.239 --> 05:08.842
- Well Ru's like a size 15
women.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.610
- You're here to say that about
her?

05:11.845 --> 05:13.580
Bold.
- Well.

05:13.580 --> 05:15.248
She got big shoes to fill, girl!

05:15.248 --> 05:17.717
(all laughing)

05:17.717 --> 05:18.552
And then I gotta, you know,

05:18.552 --> 05:20.420
sell this coat to Lizzo.

05:20.420 --> 05:21.655
That way, I can pay it off.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.890
(laughing)

05:23.890 --> 05:24.858
- But it just felt good,

05:24.858 --> 05:26.760
just being in the room
with like, all of y'all,

05:26.760 --> 05:27.594
and it's just like,

05:27.594 --> 05:29.296
obviously we have first
impressions about everybody

05:29.296 --> 05:30.764
when we first come in here.

05:30.764 --> 05:34.201
And like, clearly mine
has changed 100% on you.

05:34.201 --> 05:36.770
I'm still judging you for the
flip flops.

05:36.770 --> 05:37.604
- Same.
(all laughing)

05:37.604 --> 05:38.939
- But I think we all are, bitch.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.373
- I'm gonna be honest with you.

05:40.373 --> 05:43.043
I judged you a lot in my mind.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.111
- Same.
- With what, them flip flops?

05:45.111 --> 05:45.946
- Yeah, in the flip flops,

05:45.946 --> 05:47.681
it's Paris Hilton kinda vibe.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.083
I judge you like, this
is RuPaul, you know?

05:50.083 --> 05:53.119
But, you teach me a lesson

05:53.119 --> 05:55.222
not to judge people.
- Yeah.

05:55.222 --> 05:56.923
- My entrance, like, was, like,

05:56.923 --> 05:59.426
meant to throw you all off a
little bit.

05:59.426 --> 06:01.194
- Yeah.
(laughing)

06:01.194 --> 06:03.530
- I loved the irreverence of it,
though.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.398
Even though it was like a very,
like,

06:05.398 --> 06:07.133
what are we looking at type
vibe,

06:07.133 --> 06:08.568
if you paid attention,

06:08.568 --> 06:10.403
the details were there.
- It was very put together.

06:10.403 --> 06:11.705
- I get like, babied a lot,

06:11.705 --> 06:13.206
because I look so young.
- Yeah I know.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.041
So fishy, baby, so fishy.
- And I look so, like,

06:15.041 --> 06:15.842
unassuming.
- You missed the dog.

06:15.842 --> 06:17.877
If you entered with a dog,

06:17.877 --> 06:20.614
I would literally want to cry!

06:20.614 --> 06:22.682
- They've seen dancing,
they've seen lip syncing.

06:22.682 --> 06:25.819
None of them have seen what
you've done.

06:25.819 --> 06:29.289
And I judged you based on my
perception

06:29.289 --> 06:31.324
of what I think drag is.
- Yeah, yeah.

06:31.324 --> 06:33.627
- And you reminded me.
- You reshaped that.

06:33.627 --> 06:34.961
- That no.

06:34.961 --> 06:37.364
It's an art form that is so
broad.

06:38.331 --> 06:41.735
- I want to be living one of
those fantasies that's like,

06:41.735 --> 06:42.869
up in my mind.
- In your mind.

06:42.869 --> 06:44.371
- That I've had since I was a
kid.

06:44.371 --> 06:45.639
- And I think that drag is all
about

06:45.639 --> 06:47.607
taking the piss out of reality.

06:47.607 --> 06:49.309
- But when you did what you did,

06:49.309 --> 06:52.445
I was just like, what in the
hell?

06:52.445 --> 06:53.280
But like-
(all laughing)

06:53.280 --> 06:54.247
- It was so cool to watch.
- It was a good

06:54.247 --> 06:55.382
what in the hell.

06:55.382 --> 06:56.783
- It was unexpected.

06:56.783 --> 06:59.185
- I'm not even lying when I say,

06:59.185 --> 07:00.954
I thought I was going home
tonight.

07:01.821 --> 07:03.189
Every time I looked at their
faces,

07:03.189 --> 07:04.224
they were just like,

07:05.058 --> 07:07.427
and I couldn't tell if
that was good or bad.

07:09.462 --> 07:12.799
And obviously my inner saboteur
was like,

07:12.799 --> 07:13.633
they don't get you.

07:13.633 --> 07:16.069
And I was just like, smiling,
being like,

07:16.069 --> 07:18.405
oh I'm so happy to see
everyone one last time

07:18.405 --> 07:20.273
before I go.
- Damn.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.975
- And then they loved it.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.377
And I was like, really in shock.

07:24.377 --> 07:25.278
- I just only have a question.

07:25.278 --> 07:28.014
Like, why when we are doing our
makeups,

07:28.014 --> 07:30.517
you came all over very sad.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.686
- We were wondering where you
went, girl!

07:32.686 --> 07:34.888
- Are you okay?
- I passed away.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.423
It's okay.
- You passed away?

07:36.423 --> 07:39.426
- Yeah.
- Can I give you a hug?

07:39.426 --> 07:42.962
- I was just like, I can
not make it all the way here

07:42.962 --> 07:45.632
after years of like,

07:45.632 --> 07:46.833
just blood, sweat, and tears,

07:46.833 --> 07:49.102
and then go home first
because I'm flustered.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.437
(dramatic music)

07:50.437 --> 07:53.373
And also, I just wanted them to
get it.

07:53.373 --> 07:57.277
Like, it's lonely having

07:57.277 --> 07:59.846
really horrible dark
thoughts all the time.

08:01.047 --> 08:04.184
- But bitch, you got six
other sisters here now.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.919
Probably gonna be five after
tonight.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.487
But you got six other sisters
here now,

08:07.487 --> 08:09.155
that we are lending ears.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.224
And I say this whole-heartedly.

08:11.224 --> 08:12.859
You a weird-ass mother fucker.

08:12.859 --> 08:13.893
(all laughing)

08:13.893 --> 08:15.995
- I love you
- Bitch, but it's great.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.297
You got no shade.

08:17.297 --> 08:18.732
The best critiques out of
everybody

08:18.732 --> 08:20.233
that's sitting on this
mother fucking couch.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.101
- Well, not everybody,

08:21.101 --> 08:22.569
but it's a good sentiment.
- No no.

08:22.569 --> 08:24.337
She got better critiques than
you, too.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.872
(shady music)

08:25.872 --> 08:28.308
- I didn't get any critiques.
- I'm just saying.

08:28.308 --> 08:29.776
So you're literally that bitch,

08:29.776 --> 08:31.211
and if I had marbles,

08:31.211 --> 08:33.313
next week I'll try to trip you.

08:33.313 --> 08:34.147
(laughing)

08:34.147 --> 08:34.981
You know what I'm saying?

08:34.981 --> 08:37.450
(mumbling)
(laughing)

08:37.450 --> 08:38.385
June, how you feel?

08:39.319 --> 08:42.722
- I really pride myself

08:42.722 --> 08:46.092
on trying to be this

08:46.092 --> 08:48.762
beautiful thick hot girl shit.

08:48.762 --> 08:52.899
And there were small
details that were missed.

08:53.833 --> 08:57.404
And when you're at the drag
Olympics,

08:58.405 --> 09:00.707
it's going to get called out.

09:00.707 --> 09:01.708
It's just like,

09:02.842 --> 09:04.477
girl, if you just, you know,

09:04.477 --> 09:05.845
put on three more tights,

09:05.845 --> 09:07.480
this could have been your
moment.

09:09.349 --> 09:10.250
It maybe not.

09:11.618 --> 09:12.452
- Yeah.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.925
(dramatic music)

09:21.428 --> 09:23.530
- It's like a catch 22 for me.

09:23.530 --> 09:25.932
Because they loved my talent,

09:25.932 --> 09:27.967
but it was just small details,

09:27.967 --> 09:29.302
like busting at the seam at the
bottom.

09:29.302 --> 09:30.403
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:31.438 --> 09:34.407
- This can not be happening.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.642
It was a talent show,

09:35.642 --> 09:38.378
and the talent girl's in the
bottom?

09:38.378 --> 09:39.546
And you know, bitch,

09:39.546 --> 09:40.880
I just started wearing tights.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.182
Yesterday.
- Yeah, girl.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.016
- I was like-
(all laughing)

09:43.016 --> 09:46.186
I said, 'cause this pot of
Jambalaya likes to be seen.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.821
But clutching.
- If I may ask,

09:47.821 --> 09:49.389
why did you choose to wear
tights?

09:49.389 --> 09:50.890
I feel like you could've gone

09:50.890 --> 09:53.059
with just like a tucking panty.

09:53.059 --> 09:54.527
- If I'm being completely
honest,

09:54.527 --> 09:56.029
it was just a self conscience.

09:57.063 --> 09:57.897
This is,

09:59.232 --> 10:02.368
millions of people are
going to see and judge me.

10:03.870 --> 10:06.206
I didn't want them to say,

10:06.206 --> 10:08.708
"Oh, she moves good,
but look at her thighs."

10:09.642 --> 10:11.444
Like, judge me that my big ass
is up here

10:11.444 --> 10:13.146
doing barrel turns.
(laughing)

10:13.146 --> 10:14.647
- I love your thighs, bitch!

10:14.647 --> 10:17.917
- I didn't want the masses to
judge.

10:17.917 --> 10:19.219
- I would say that you are gonna
have

10:19.219 --> 10:21.754
millions more people
support and appreciate

10:21.754 --> 10:23.323
and love and relate.
- Absolutely.

10:23.323 --> 10:24.858
- You seem like a good person,

10:24.858 --> 10:26.159
and I appreciate that.

10:26.159 --> 10:26.993
- And I'm shady as fuck,

10:26.993 --> 10:28.528
but I gotta-
(all laughing)

10:28.528 --> 10:30.263
- I am like a energy person,

10:30.263 --> 10:33.666
so I feel the energy about,
like, each one of you.

10:33.666 --> 10:36.002
And I love this group.

10:36.002 --> 10:37.937
- [Kornbread] Absolutely.

10:37.937 --> 10:38.771
- How do you feel, baby?

10:38.771 --> 10:39.906
- Tell 'em, Alyssa.

10:39.906 --> 10:41.074
Share your story.

10:41.074 --> 10:44.177
- I got so many emotions right
now.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.946
(dramatic music)

10:46.946 --> 10:47.780
There's so many people in Puerto
Rico,

10:47.780 --> 10:49.616
that they're rooting for me
right now.

10:52.051 --> 10:53.152
And sometimes,

10:54.754 --> 10:55.588
when I get-

10:58.358 --> 11:00.393
- Share it, baby, share it.

11:00.393 --> 11:03.530
(dramatic music)

11:03.530 --> 11:06.399
- I don't feel very
happy at all, you know?

11:06.399 --> 11:08.902
I don't know, might be in the
bottom.

11:08.902 --> 11:11.170
Getting to here is very
difficult to me.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.973
I came from this island.

11:13.973 --> 11:15.875
English is not my first
language.

11:15.875 --> 11:16.976
- Yeah.

11:16.976 --> 11:19.646
- I try my best to
communicate with others.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.418
It's very hard, it's very hard.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.555
I just keep it up, and okay,

11:28.555 --> 11:30.590
you can do this, you can be
yourself,

11:30.590 --> 11:32.792
and show the world who you are.

11:32.792 --> 11:36.629
But, it's very difficult for
me, being Latin, you know.

11:36.629 --> 11:38.398
She doesn't speak.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.133
- Girl.
- Oh yeah, I can speak.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.001
I'm not speaking very
English kind of thing,

11:42.001 --> 11:43.937
but I speak from my heart.

11:43.937 --> 11:44.771
- What makes you feel like

11:44.771 --> 11:46.272
they didn't think you spoke?

11:46.272 --> 11:48.541
(dramatic music)

11:48.541 --> 11:50.176
- No no no, it's, that's very-

11:51.044 --> 11:53.212
- For herself.
- Yeah, for me.

11:53.212 --> 11:56.449
- Baby, you not having English
as your first language,

11:56.449 --> 11:57.584
it's not an issue.

11:57.584 --> 11:58.952
Bitch, English is my first
language.

11:58.952 --> 12:00.753
Them mother fuckers didn't
understand nothing I said.

12:00.753 --> 12:03.423
- I just hope to connect with
each other,

12:03.423 --> 12:06.793
because we are far away
from our family and friends.

12:06.793 --> 12:08.194
So to me,
(melancholy music)

12:08.194 --> 12:10.163
each one of you is very, very...

12:12.365 --> 12:14.901
I'm sorry, I'm just very
emotional.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.138
- And right now, we're family.

12:19.138 --> 12:21.274
- Bitch, I'm gonna mess
my makeup right now.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.977
- You could definitely talk
to us as much as you want to.

12:23.977 --> 12:26.412
And if we say, "Huh?"

12:26.412 --> 12:28.047
Bitch, just repeat it.
- Okay.

12:29.015 --> 12:29.882
I will do that.
(laughing)

12:29.882 --> 12:32.118
- I have not had a problem
with understanding you.

12:32.118 --> 12:33.319
- None of us have.
- No.

12:33.319 --> 12:35.221
- 'Cause it just goes to
show, you're talented.

12:35.221 --> 12:36.322
You're talented as fuck.

12:36.322 --> 12:37.156
- Thanks for that.

12:37.156 --> 12:37.991
Thanks for that, baby.

12:37.991 --> 12:38.825
- And majority of the time,

12:38.825 --> 12:40.593
we're looking down at your
crotch in them shorts.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.195
We ain't even listening
to what you're saying.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.529
(laughing)

12:43.529 --> 12:44.497
fucking with you.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.165
- Are you fucking?

12:46.165 --> 12:47.233
- Yeah yeah!
(laughing)

12:47.233 --> 12:50.136
- Just like we're looking
at the hole in your tights.

12:50.136 --> 12:51.371
- Whoa!

12:51.371 --> 12:53.439
Okay Ms. Christmas Tree Skirt.

12:53.439 --> 12:56.409
- Ooh, okay!
(all laughing)

12:56.409 --> 12:58.111
- How about you, Miss Polka
Dots?

12:58.111 --> 12:59.379
(laughing)

12:59.379 --> 13:02.148
- I feel like I got a lot
of negative critiques.

13:03.549 --> 13:06.185
I definitely think I
might be in the bottom.

13:06.185 --> 13:10.690
- Really?
(dramatic music)

13:10.690 --> 13:13.259
(upbeat music)

13:14.794 --> 13:17.497
I feel like they really saw
something

13:17.497 --> 13:19.465
very special about you, though.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.467
- They definitely seem
interested in me,

13:21.467 --> 13:23.369
and I am very interested in
myself.

13:23.369 --> 13:25.038
(all laughing)

13:25.038 --> 13:27.674
It wasn't my original
choice for the talent show.

13:27.674 --> 13:30.043
I wanted to do an original song
as well.

13:30.043 --> 13:32.278
I just, I didn't have enough
time.

13:32.278 --> 13:34.080
I had to move out of my
apartment

13:34.080 --> 13:35.915
right as I had to leave for Drag
Race,

13:35.915 --> 13:38.551
and I had so much shit going
on.

13:38.551 --> 13:41.254
My cat has been having
a lot of health issues.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.388
- Damn.
- So like,

13:42.388 --> 13:43.790
what you saw was just

13:43.790 --> 13:46.859
me coming up with shit
off the top of my head.

13:46.859 --> 13:48.061
- When the writing's on the wall

13:48.061 --> 13:50.329
that you might be the first to
go home,

13:50.329 --> 13:52.231
that can shake you to your core.

13:52.231 --> 13:56.769
- I'm glad that I was able
to let go and just be weird,

13:56.769 --> 13:58.771
and just be obnoxious.

13:58.771 --> 14:00.840
- What's the verse? What's the
moment?

14:00.840 --> 14:02.408
- I got a hot shit in the
chamber.

14:02.408 --> 14:03.643
- That is so fucking funny.

14:03.643 --> 14:05.745
- I'm gonna put it on a fanny
pack.

14:05.745 --> 14:07.447
- Mission accomplished.
(laughing)

14:07.447 --> 14:09.248
- So who y'all think are the
bottom two?

14:09.248 --> 14:10.383
(all groaning)

14:10.383 --> 14:11.918
- I don't know.
- Bitch.

14:11.918 --> 14:13.453
(shady music)

14:13.453 --> 14:15.388
- You asked the question,
you answer first.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.823
- Oh bitch, I don't give a
fuck.

14:16.823 --> 14:18.391
I definitely feel like you.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.360
It's realness, baby.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.895
And I think June, too.

14:25.998 --> 14:27.467
It's just real talk.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.535
We knew what we signed up for,

14:29.535 --> 14:31.104
but it is pulling on a little
heart string

14:31.104 --> 14:32.138
on me at this moment in time

14:32.138 --> 14:35.408
because no one wants to be
the first one to go home.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.410
- I mean, it's between the three
of us.

14:37.410 --> 14:40.012
And if I'm being completely
honest,

14:40.012 --> 14:42.815
I do think you're
definitely in the bottom.

14:43.649 --> 14:47.386
Which is so sad because you
improv-ed your own script,

14:47.386 --> 14:49.522
gave your signature drag,

14:49.522 --> 14:52.792
and everyone showed
their individual talent.

14:52.792 --> 14:54.260
- Yeah.
- That's what made it so hard.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.028
I think that's why they
ended up nitpicking

14:56.028 --> 14:57.864
like it was a top five type
challenge.

14:57.864 --> 14:58.698
- Right.
- Yeah.

14:58.698 --> 14:59.532
- I was gonna tell Alyssa, like,

14:59.532 --> 15:00.500
me following her up.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.135
Bitch, you made me nervous as
hell!

15:02.135 --> 15:05.037
When you all bring something so
fierce,

15:05.037 --> 15:06.839
that's when they start to get

15:06.839 --> 15:08.841
down to the Ts and the Is,

15:08.841 --> 15:10.476
that are dotted and crossed.
- Yeah, yeah.

15:10.476 --> 15:13.780
- Which, I think, sucks.

15:13.780 --> 15:14.781
But I will say it.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.282
Y'all want to learn that song.

15:17.350 --> 15:18.284
- Oof.

15:18.284 --> 15:19.118
- For sure.

15:19.118 --> 15:21.254
- I think I should listen to the
lyrics.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.522
Just in case.

15:24.123 --> 15:26.726
- Is anybody able to pull on my
toes?

15:26.726 --> 15:27.560
- Like yank 'em?

15:27.560 --> 15:29.128
You getting 'em, like,
painful feet, bitch?

15:29.128 --> 15:31.097
Mine is the same way.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.132
- Ooh, get deeper into the
tight.

15:33.132 --> 15:33.966
- Oh fuck!

15:33.966 --> 15:35.434
I just left all the glitter
here.

15:35.434 --> 15:36.569
- She's marking her territory.

15:36.569 --> 15:37.603
- You bitches is rude.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.172
How are y'all leaving my
fat ass on this couch?

15:39.172 --> 15:40.406
Now I gotta little-
- Here, I'll help.

15:40.406 --> 15:42.175
- Gotta wiggle, I gotta get up.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.377
(grunting)
(bell dings)

15:44.377 --> 15:47.446
(suspenseful music)

15:47.446 --> 15:48.881
- How are you feeling?

15:48.881 --> 15:50.917
- I'm definitely gonna have to
lip sync.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.351
- You think so?

15:52.351 --> 15:54.453
- I'm not going down without a
fight.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.222
- I mean if you have to,
do you know the song?

15:56.222 --> 15:57.757
- I think so.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.058
- Oh god.

15:59.058 --> 16:01.160
- Alright ladies, ten
minutes 'til main stage.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.262
(suspenseful music)

16:03.262 --> 16:06.299
- [Orion] I'm starting to feel
all of the emotions again.

16:06.299 --> 16:09.368
I am trying not to think
about anything else

16:09.368 --> 16:11.437
but this lip sync.

16:11.437 --> 16:12.405
Which one of these bitches

16:12.405 --> 16:13.840
am I gonna have to fight?

16:16.242 --> 16:17.877
- [Alyssa] I am a fluent
entertainer.

16:17.877 --> 16:21.514
I hope that they see my energy,
my power.

16:22.715 --> 16:25.518
Because I know that I
am a very fierce queen,

16:25.518 --> 16:26.419
and I can do more.

16:29.355 --> 16:31.123
- [June] I'm about to fight for
my life.

16:31.123 --> 16:33.059
All of that inner saboteur bull
shit,

16:33.059 --> 16:35.061
you need to let it go.

16:35.928 --> 16:40.433
A sense of drive just came over
me.

16:40.433 --> 16:43.703
I'm about to shit up.

16:43.703 --> 16:44.604
Pull up a chair, baby,

16:44.604 --> 16:46.472
'cause Jambalaya's about to
serve.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.542
- Alright ladies, time for the
main stage.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.010
Follow me.
(dramatic music)

16:51.010 --> 16:52.144
- Slowly walk.

16:52.144 --> 16:54.247
It's gonna take me two
minutes to make for that door.

16:54.247 --> 16:55.681
- These hoes really don't
listen.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.083
Them bitches said go to
the mother fucking door.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.417
- Baby, you are in Crocs.

16:58.417 --> 16:59.585
What do you fucking talking
about?

16:59.585 --> 17:02.388
- I was walking over there
in my mother fucking Crocs!

17:02.388 --> 17:03.623
- Your fucking Crocs, bitch!

17:03.623 --> 17:05.091
What is that!

17:05.091 --> 17:06.926
- These are called my willows.

17:06.926 --> 17:11.464
(laughing)
(dramatic music)

17:11.464 --> 17:12.899
- [RuPaul] Welcome back, ladies.

17:12.899 --> 17:14.867
I've made some decisions.

17:14.867 --> 17:15.701
June Jambalaya,

17:16.702 --> 17:18.337
Orion Story,

17:18.337 --> 17:19.805
the time has come,

17:19.805 --> 17:22.475
for you to lip sync

17:22.475 --> 17:27.013
for your life!

17:27.013 --> 17:29.515
(dramatic music)

17:29.515 --> 17:31.651
June Jambalaya, shante you stay.

17:32.585 --> 17:35.054
(melancholy music)
(weeping)

17:35.054 --> 17:37.723
Orion, sashay away.

17:40.693 --> 17:42.595
(dramatic music)

17:42.595 --> 17:45.831
- Every emotion is going through
my body.

17:45.831 --> 17:48.000
I just like, don't know how to
feel.

17:49.135 --> 17:53.039
I just kind of set myself
up for failure sometimes.

17:53.039 --> 17:56.108
I have to stop waiting
until the last second.

17:56.108 --> 17:57.143
That was my downfall.

18:01.213 --> 18:02.048
Hmm.

18:03.449 --> 18:06.052
There's notes, oh my god!

18:06.052 --> 18:08.754
I'm gonna cry.
(melancholy music)

18:08.754 --> 18:11.090
It was so lovely meeting you.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.758
I loved your aerobics character,

18:12.758 --> 18:15.594
and I can't wait to see what
else is in this chamber.

18:15.594 --> 18:16.429
Bosco.

18:17.563 --> 18:18.397
That's so sweet.

18:20.132 --> 18:21.767
Hey love, remember,

18:21.767 --> 18:23.602
you made it on Drag Race.

18:23.602 --> 18:26.706
Sending good energy to your cat,
Kerri.

18:30.843 --> 18:35.848
Ooh, this is the worst part.
(zipper zipping)

18:36.515 --> 18:39.352
It's definitely a lot
harder than you think.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.220
There is so much that goes into
it

18:41.220 --> 18:42.822
that you don't even think about.

18:44.523 --> 18:47.693
But, I did feel very validated

18:47.693 --> 18:51.030
that out of everyone who
auditions every year,

18:51.030 --> 18:53.866
that I got on, and I got on my
first time.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.136
The hot shit in the chamber

18:57.136 --> 18:59.405
is gonna follow me for a while,
I think.

19:02.074 --> 19:04.844
Be very happy to just
probably burn this wig.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.079
(laughing)

19:07.079 --> 19:08.080
I'll have a bonfire.

19:09.348 --> 19:10.383
I want to see my cat.

19:11.384 --> 19:14.787
I'm also excited to go lay in
the woods.

19:14.787 --> 19:15.755
I do that a lot.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.924
RuPaul, you haven't seen the
last of me.

19:18.924 --> 19:21.861
(melancholy music)

19:34.640 --> 19:36.876
The judges saw my fearlessness.

19:40.079 --> 19:41.580
I take a lot of pride in that.

19:43.249 --> 19:44.383
The journey never ends.

19:47.019 --> 19:50.356
Bye, bye, bye.
(engine revving)

19:50.356 --> 19:52.925

19:55.661 --> 19:58.831
