WEBVTT

01:05.315 --> 01:07.108
Deet? Deet!

01:07.192 --> 01:10.111
-Uh... I'm fine! I'm fine!
-Deet!

01:12.989 --> 01:14.783
What in Thra was that explosion?

01:17.243 --> 01:18.870
-Are you all right?

01:18.953 --> 01:21.623
Rian! Of course, I'm fine. How are you?

01:26.044 --> 01:27.545
Uh...

01:27.921 --> 01:30.632
Um... Deet...

01:30.715 --> 01:33.134
-Mm-hm?
-Have you been making bombs?

01:33.218 --> 01:34.636
No!

01:35.178 --> 01:37.639
Well, smoke bombs. So, yes?

01:38.139 --> 01:40.391
It's an old Grottan trick
for clearing out hollerbat nests.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.352
Oh, it stings the eyes something fierce.

01:42.435 --> 01:44.312
My father accidentally got a face full
of smoke one time,

01:44.395 --> 01:45.522
and he couldn't see straight
for three days.

01:47.023 --> 01:48.942
You Grottan have a lot of tricks.

01:49.275 --> 01:50.235
I guess so.

01:53.238 --> 01:55.657
We'll need them
if the other Gelfling don't show.

01:56.157 --> 01:57.242
They'll be here.

01:57.742 --> 01:59.494
What makes you so sure?

02:00.245 --> 02:01.079
Hope.

02:03.790 --> 02:04.666
Um...

02:04.999 --> 02:05.917
I...

02:08.378 --> 02:09.295
I was thinking.

02:09.963 --> 02:10.797
Hm?

02:11.756 --> 02:14.676
I never properly got to see
the Caves of Grot.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.804
Maybe we could go back
when this is all over.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.765
When everything is back like it was.

02:21.975 --> 02:25.353
I don't think anything
will ever be like it was again, Rian.

02:27.897 --> 02:29.691
-No.

02:31.317 --> 02:32.402
It will be better.

02:36.364 --> 02:38.449
Uh, I should get back to work.

02:39.325 --> 02:40.493
- Oh.

02:42.036 --> 02:42.996
I'm sorry.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.411
The First Brother rises.

03:23.494 --> 03:25.955
It is time we march on Stone-in-the-Wood.

03:26.706 --> 03:27.749
Do you sleep?

03:28.374 --> 03:29.876
Of course, sire.

03:30.418 --> 03:31.419
Do you dream?

03:31.878 --> 03:33.588
-Dream?
-Yes.

03:34.172 --> 03:35.423
No, Emperor.

03:35.798 --> 03:37.008
Neither did I,

03:37.383 --> 03:40.386
until I began my experiments
upon the Darkening.

03:40.637 --> 03:44.724
Now, my slumber is riddled by nightmares.

03:45.058 --> 03:49.187
Do you remember what it was like...
before we were rent asunder?

03:50.730 --> 03:54.651
-I don't think of such things.
-And yet the thoughts come.

03:57.695 --> 04:00.406
-I remember suffering.
-Yes.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.450
-Guilt.
-Yes.

04:02.533 --> 04:03.493
And sorrow.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.454
But it's hard to recall, lik--

04:06.871 --> 04:08.206
A dream?

04:08.414 --> 04:09.499
A nightmare.

04:09.832 --> 04:10.667
Yes.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.628
We know the torment that lies behind us,

04:13.836 --> 04:16.965
but what torment waits
beyond this existence?

04:17.674 --> 04:21.469
All the more reason to hold on to life
with all claws...

04:22.804 --> 04:24.597
no matter the cost.

04:29.644 --> 04:32.897
Come... Yes...

04:42.865 --> 04:44.492
Emperor, what are you doing?

04:44.951 --> 04:46.286
What I must!

04:47.370 --> 04:49.664
Gathering the Darkening.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.221
No matter the cost!

05:08.975 --> 05:09.892
Mm.

05:12.854 --> 05:15.273
Ah... Gruenaks.

05:15.356 --> 05:16.941
-Ha! Hm?

05:17.066 --> 05:18.484
What is this, hm?

05:19.444 --> 05:20.653
Out of lord's way.

05:22.530 --> 05:24.407
Why so sad, wretches?

05:24.615 --> 05:28.661
Chamberlain is pleased with Gruenaks.
Plan worked to perfection.

05:28.828 --> 05:32.415
Chamberlain is back
in Emperor's good graces,

05:32.498 --> 05:34.500
where Chamberlain belongs.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.047
Mm?

05:39.130 --> 05:40.923
-Mm?

05:41.007 --> 05:42.759
Agh... Go?

05:43.384 --> 05:45.678
Leave? No, no, no!

05:45.887 --> 05:49.182
Still much to do, plan not yet done.

05:51.434 --> 05:55.396
Chamberlain will decide
when Gruenak service is finished.

05:56.814 --> 06:01.361
Until then,
Gruenaks will stay right where are.

06:01.986 --> 06:02.945
-Hmm...

06:07.784 --> 06:08.701
Hm!

06:17.293 --> 06:19.420
Gather the Skeksis in the Crystal Chamber.

06:19.670 --> 06:21.881
Yes. As you command, sire.

06:23.299 --> 06:25.009
-Emperor!
- Eh?

06:25.093 --> 06:27.887
I have completed the modifications
to our armor.

06:28.304 --> 06:32.100
I look forward to putting it
to marvelous use against the Gelfling.

06:32.183 --> 06:35.728
You will remain behind and build
the soldiers Chamberlain promised me.

06:36.020 --> 06:37.271
But, Emperor,

06:37.522 --> 06:41.442
I wish to fight to prove
my physical prowess in battle

06:41.526 --> 06:43.778
against nefarious forces.

06:43.861 --> 06:45.446
You? Fight?

06:47.949 --> 06:52.578
Out of the question.
Your studious talents lie elsewhere.

06:53.329 --> 06:55.581
Of course, my Emperor.

06:56.707 --> 06:58.000
Come, General.

06:59.043 --> 07:00.670
Time to be on our way.

07:01.379 --> 07:05.842
We have nefarious forces to battle.

07:14.809 --> 07:16.060
- Weakling!

07:26.904 --> 07:27.822
Ah!

07:42.712 --> 07:43.546
Huh...

07:50.011 --> 07:51.846
Rian!

07:51.929 --> 07:53.723
-Huh?

07:53.806 --> 07:54.849
Brea!

07:58.769 --> 08:00.146
It's so good to see you.

08:00.521 --> 08:02.064
I'm so glad you're safe.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.525
I have something that belongs to you.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.238
- Here.
-My journal!

08:10.448 --> 08:12.366
Thank you.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.368
Brea? Brea!

08:18.456 --> 08:20.166
-Brea! You're back!
-Deet!

08:20.541 --> 08:22.210
Deet, I missed you.

08:24.629 --> 08:25.588
Where's Hup?

08:26.005 --> 08:28.966
The Heretic and Wanderer are nursing him
back to health at the Circle of the Suns.

08:29.050 --> 08:29.926
Good.

08:30.426 --> 08:31.302
Are you alone?

08:32.178 --> 08:34.055
I brought a few friends.

08:44.023 --> 08:44.941
Rian...

08:46.526 --> 08:48.027
I ask your forgiveness.

08:48.861 --> 08:52.532
You came to me in your time of need,
and I turned you away.

08:53.574 --> 08:54.909
I did not know better...

08:56.536 --> 08:57.662
but I should have.

08:58.746 --> 09:00.957
You were only trying to protect your clan.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.087
I'd expect no less of my Maudra.

09:06.170 --> 09:07.338
- Hm.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.757
How did you escape the Hunter?

09:10.508 --> 09:13.678
I didn't. I was taken to the castle.

09:14.136 --> 09:15.680
We were all prisoners.

09:16.931 --> 09:20.268
Mother Aughra traded her life for ours.

09:21.519 --> 09:23.229
The Skeksis drained her.

09:24.021 --> 09:26.023
Mother Aughra? She's...

09:26.399 --> 09:27.400
Dead.

09:31.696 --> 09:34.073
We must prove ourselves worthy
of her sacrifice.

09:35.116 --> 09:37.410
But how can we stand
against the Skeksis?

09:37.910 --> 09:39.245
There are so few of us.

09:39.662 --> 09:40.830
More will come.

09:45.918 --> 09:48.129
And we have the Dual Glaive.

09:50.172 --> 09:51.299
I'm not afraid.

09:53.342 --> 09:54.343
Not anymore.

09:56.178 --> 09:57.513
I'm done with running.

09:59.515 --> 10:02.893
I'll die where I stand before I run again.

10:02.977 --> 10:05.146
-And we still stand with you.

10:10.401 --> 10:13.154
All right, then. Let's get to work.

10:36.594 --> 10:39.847
War!

10:43.392 --> 10:47.188
Indeed, the Skeksis are bigger, stronger.
But we have a few surprises.

10:47.271 --> 10:48.856
Now you.

10:49.815 --> 10:50.983
Mine's broken.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.240
Good.

11:03.162 --> 11:04.121
Mm...

11:07.792 --> 11:09.168
Ah...

11:21.389 --> 11:23.432
- There.

11:32.817 --> 11:33.901
Good!

12:04.890 --> 12:10.271
I am incontrovertibly
the most abused creature in all of Thra.

12:14.191 --> 12:16.193
Detestable Arathim.

12:17.528 --> 12:19.071
-Mm...
-What are you looking at?

12:21.198 --> 12:23.576
Well? Turn the wheel, Gruenak.

12:30.958 --> 12:31.917
Let's see...

12:34.754 --> 12:35.921
Hm...

12:38.674 --> 12:40.301
Very, very interesting.

12:45.848 --> 12:50.895
The fibrous viscera
continue to reject revivification.

12:51.437 --> 12:52.897
-Hm...

12:54.023 --> 12:58.569
I will need to find a much stronger source
of connective tissue

12:58.652 --> 13:00.571
to augment the fibroblasts.

13:00.654 --> 13:02.990
Hm... But from where?

13:06.827 --> 13:08.537
Ah! Ah!

13:28.015 --> 13:29.058
Enough!

13:30.601 --> 13:33.187
There is only so much callous disrespect

13:33.270 --> 13:36.023
a Lord of the Crystal can endure!

13:36.106 --> 13:40.194
I have earned a bit of genuine frivolity.

13:40.486 --> 13:44.740
How fortunate
I tucked a few vials of essence away

13:44.824 --> 13:47.326
for just such a festal occasion.

13:48.118 --> 13:49.370
Mm...

13:50.079 --> 13:51.330
-Ah...

13:55.084 --> 13:57.545
Now, clean up this mess, slaves.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.632
Ah...

14:14.395 --> 14:15.271
Hm?

14:42.172 --> 14:43.090
Archer...

14:43.966 --> 14:44.800
dead?

14:45.968 --> 14:48.762
-Not... quite.

14:48.846 --> 14:50.931
But not alive either.

14:52.266 --> 14:56.061
A force binds urVa to Thra...

14:57.354 --> 14:59.648
even... now.

15:00.274 --> 15:01.150
Huh?

15:03.986 --> 15:05.362
But what could be?

15:06.530 --> 15:08.240
-Aughra.
-Hm?

15:11.160 --> 15:12.119
Hmm...

15:26.300 --> 15:31.513
Yes! Good! Play for your Emperor!

15:33.807 --> 15:37.895
Faster! Louder!

15:45.361 --> 15:46.612
Glorious.

15:47.321 --> 15:48.864
Podlings!

15:48.948 --> 15:50.324
Podlings!

15:52.076 --> 15:55.079
-Your Emperor is hungry.

15:59.208 --> 16:01.543
Expediency is key.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.797
An Emperor must not be made to wait.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.802
What is this offal?

16:09.885 --> 16:12.763
This rubbish is not fit for an Emperor.

16:18.227 --> 16:22.898
When we fail our Emperor,
we must be punished!

16:32.324 --> 16:34.493
Pugnacious Podling!

16:34.785 --> 16:36.787
-Ah... ah!

16:37.371 --> 16:40.457
-Get back here, Podling.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.418
Where are you scuttling off to?

16:44.336 --> 16:47.172
I'm not done with you malingerers!

16:49.466 --> 16:50.467
Huh?

16:52.428 --> 16:53.637
Hm...

16:53.929 --> 16:55.597
-Meh...

16:57.558 --> 16:58.767
Hunter?

16:59.518 --> 17:01.145
SkekMal?

17:02.438 --> 17:03.355
Hm?

17:08.235 --> 17:10.696
- Ahh!

17:19.204 --> 17:21.832
You're... You're alive!

17:21.915 --> 17:23.083
Where is Rian?

17:23.709 --> 17:27.421
Stone-in-the-Wood.
The other Skeksis are there already.

17:27.838 --> 17:30.924
They've gone to extirpate
the Gelfling uprising.

17:31.258 --> 17:33.427
-Yet you remain behind?

17:33.844 --> 17:36.180
Useless coward!

17:36.263 --> 17:40.100
The Emperor commanded me to stay behind.
I wanted to fight!

17:40.184 --> 17:42.186
I am not a coward!

17:44.063 --> 17:45.314
SkekMal!

17:49.068 --> 17:50.402
No...

17:50.486 --> 17:51.361
Archer?

17:57.326 --> 17:58.327
-Oh!

18:00.079 --> 18:02.372
Well.

18:02.790 --> 18:05.167
That was... exciting.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.794
-Yes!

18:31.026 --> 18:32.361
Mm...

18:33.570 --> 18:34.780
Mm...

18:37.074 --> 18:39.451
Agh, peachberries!

18:54.007 --> 18:55.092
Hm...

18:57.469 --> 18:58.512
For Tavra.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.226
For Mother.

19:12.901 --> 19:14.069
They're here.

19:34.339 --> 19:35.591
Huh?

19:36.216 --> 19:37.092
This?

19:37.551 --> 19:40.470
This is the mighty rebellion
I was promised?

19:42.514 --> 19:45.434
We'll be home in time for lunch.

19:45.517 --> 19:48.687
Ha! Look at their tiny little swords!

19:49.062 --> 19:51.648
Ha! That's adorable.

19:51.732 --> 19:54.359
Oh, I wanna squish the green one.

19:55.152 --> 19:56.862
The reign of the Skeksis is over.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.782
All Gelfling rise against you.

20:01.867 --> 20:05.078
Is that so? Where are they?

20:06.121 --> 20:07.080
They'll be here.

20:07.581 --> 20:10.584
Nobody coming, hopeless wretch.

20:10.667 --> 20:14.129
Gelfling will never rise.

20:14.630 --> 20:18.675
You will all die here!

20:18.759 --> 20:20.844
- Die!

20:20.928 --> 20:23.639
Now... For nothing!

20:26.183 --> 20:27.684
Oh, the impudence!

20:27.768 --> 20:30.562
Then our sacrifice will inspire others.

20:33.315 --> 20:34.942
Just as my mother's did.

20:36.151 --> 20:37.569
If it's a fight you want,

20:38.528 --> 20:39.655
I'll give you one.

20:40.113 --> 20:41.031
Just you...

20:42.407 --> 20:43.242
and me.

20:44.576 --> 20:45.702
Hm...

20:46.203 --> 20:50.958
Is beneath mighty Emperor
to face lowly Gelfling in combat.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.376
Hm?

20:55.045 --> 20:59.049
Best left to fearsome General, yes?

21:01.134 --> 21:02.052
Sire...

21:02.761 --> 21:05.264
it would be my honor
to deliver you Rian's head.

21:05.847 --> 21:06.890
Very well.

21:06.974 --> 21:10.352
And fetch me the Dual Glaive
while you're about it.

21:12.896 --> 21:13.814
With pleasure.

21:14.189 --> 21:15.274
Are you sure about this?

21:15.357 --> 21:17.609
- Make him bleed!
-No.

21:17.985 --> 21:19.236
But I have hope.

21:19.861 --> 21:21.863
-Be careful, Rian.
- Stuff him good!

21:21.947 --> 21:24.283
- Teach him a lesson!
- Go on, Rian! Go on!

21:24.366 --> 21:25.409
Shall we?

21:28.870 --> 21:30.247
Let's have some fun!

21:35.335 --> 21:37.379
-We have to help him.

21:37.462 --> 21:39.339
-Pest!

21:40.590 --> 21:41.633
We stick to the plan.

21:48.432 --> 21:50.851
- Pitiful.

21:53.061 --> 21:54.730
Teach that Gelfling a lesson!

21:58.400 --> 22:00.902
- Where are you going, Gelfling?

22:00.986 --> 22:02.946
- Wait.

22:06.116 --> 22:07.242
Rian!

22:07.326 --> 22:08.201
Any more tricks?

22:10.954 --> 22:12.372
You'll die!

22:21.548 --> 22:22.883
Yes.

22:23.050 --> 22:23.884
Rian.

22:26.553 --> 22:28.764
You filthy Gelfling! What are you doing?

22:32.142 --> 22:35.228
Be done with it. Kill me!

22:36.063 --> 22:38.065
I'm no killer!

22:44.196 --> 22:45.280
Huh?

22:45.947 --> 22:47.157
How could it...

22:50.744 --> 22:51.578
Huh...

22:51.661 --> 22:53.330
- No...

22:59.169 --> 23:01.421
-Forgive me, Emperor.
-Leave.

23:02.005 --> 23:04.383
-You failed me.
-No!

23:04.466 --> 23:06.718
- No!

23:06.802 --> 23:09.388
- For Shame!
- Lousy skekVar!

23:11.556 --> 23:12.766
Mm...

23:13.392 --> 23:15.727
-Stand ready.

23:15.811 --> 23:16.895
Next!

23:16.978 --> 23:18.063
Skeksis!

23:26.571 --> 23:29.449
- They're coming!

23:29.533 --> 23:30.742
Get ready!

23:30.826 --> 23:31.910
Here! Take these!

23:34.579 --> 23:37.207
Attack!

23:37.749 --> 23:39.251
Now!

23:49.511 --> 23:50.762
For Thra!

23:56.768 --> 23:57.602
Yes!

23:58.854 --> 24:00.147
Take that!

24:01.982 --> 24:02.816
My eyes!

24:03.191 --> 24:04.151
Yes!

24:07.737 --> 24:09.656
Charge!

24:14.578 --> 24:16.580
- Swap left!
- Right behind you!

24:20.834 --> 24:23.545
- They're everywhere!

24:24.254 --> 24:26.882
-I will not be bullied!

24:29.634 --> 24:32.053
Come back, you fool!

24:32.804 --> 24:35.223
Who wants more?

24:35.307 --> 24:37.642
Let's see how you like this.

24:40.812 --> 24:42.856
No! Seladon!

24:49.070 --> 24:51.114
Fara!

24:53.742 --> 24:57.537
I got one!
Oh, did you see? Did you see?

24:57.621 --> 24:59.331
I got one!

25:03.877 --> 25:05.629
Where are you...

25:06.171 --> 25:07.088
bug?

25:08.298 --> 25:09.174
Eh?

25:10.467 --> 25:12.344
Oh, look.

25:12.844 --> 25:14.721
-There you are!

25:17.474 --> 25:18.642
Huh? Ah!

25:25.607 --> 25:27.275
Let go of me!

25:27.359 --> 25:29.069
-Fara!

25:33.323 --> 25:34.324
Here!

25:37.702 --> 25:40.038
Mangy fuzzball! Argh!

25:40.121 --> 25:42.040
Get off me!

25:48.964 --> 25:50.215
No, wait!

25:50.757 --> 25:52.259
That's mine!

25:52.717 --> 25:55.136
Bring it back so I can kill it!

25:59.057 --> 26:01.059
-Here...

26:02.394 --> 26:03.770
How badly are you hurt?

26:05.021 --> 26:07.607
Had to protect the All-Maudra.

26:07.899 --> 26:11.111
-I'm gonna get you out of here.

26:11.611 --> 26:14.030
Ow, get off-- Get off me!
Get off me!

26:14.114 --> 26:15.156
Do you hear?

26:16.825 --> 26:18.118
It's Thra...

26:18.994 --> 26:20.996
calling me home.

26:23.206 --> 26:25.667
-It sounds... like music.

26:27.502 --> 26:29.546
No, you can't give up.

26:30.088 --> 26:31.673
You have to fight.

26:32.299 --> 26:33.258
We need you.

26:37.554 --> 26:39.264
Your mother...

26:40.265 --> 26:42.350
would be proud.

27:08.460 --> 27:09.878
She's home.

27:27.604 --> 27:28.688
Ah...

27:29.022 --> 27:30.148
Mmm.

27:30.857 --> 27:31.816
Good.

27:35.195 --> 27:37.947
-What is this?

27:39.074 --> 27:40.283
Mutiny!

27:40.659 --> 27:43.286
-No! No slave!

27:43.745 --> 27:46.039
How dare you threaten me!

27:46.122 --> 27:48.249
I am skekTek, the Scientist!

27:48.375 --> 27:51.503
I am a master of life and death.

27:51.920 --> 27:56.174
I am a genius! I am a Lord of the Crystal!

27:56.257 --> 27:59.803
I... am... Skeksis!

28:05.183 --> 28:08.395
-Inbreads.

28:16.444 --> 28:17.862
Savages!

28:21.324 --> 28:22.951
You bad!

28:23.034 --> 28:25.995
No, help! Release me!

28:32.252 --> 28:34.921
-Brutes!

28:54.065 --> 28:55.692
Marvelous cretin!

29:06.286 --> 29:09.664
Know your place.

29:15.170 --> 29:17.505
You must pay for this betrayal!

29:43.531 --> 29:44.616
Hm...

29:46.451 --> 29:47.827
Oh, what a waste.

29:49.078 --> 29:52.999
Or perhaps... not.

30:10.975 --> 30:12.977
Naughty princess!

30:16.397 --> 30:17.690
- Oh!

30:26.032 --> 30:27.951
Hold still!

30:30.995 --> 30:32.455
-Here!

30:35.250 --> 30:37.210
-You're not going to dare!

30:39.295 --> 30:41.548
Get it off! Get it off! What is it?

30:41.881 --> 30:43.049
Get it off me! Help!

30:43.174 --> 30:44.509
Where is Rian?

30:44.843 --> 30:46.678
- Here I am!

30:48.680 --> 30:50.598
Blasphemer!

30:52.392 --> 30:53.768
-Huh?

30:53.893 --> 30:55.562
No! Get off!

31:12.787 --> 31:14.038
Mm...

31:14.622 --> 31:15.582
General.

31:15.915 --> 31:16.958
Huh? Hm?

31:17.125 --> 31:19.210
There you are.

31:19.752 --> 31:21.880
Cursed Gelfling...

31:21.963 --> 31:23.006
Good!

31:24.507 --> 31:25.425
Fought dirty.

31:26.217 --> 31:28.720
I'm not surprised. They have no honor.

31:32.015 --> 31:32.932
Friend...

31:33.558 --> 31:34.475
skekSil..

31:35.560 --> 31:37.186
I'm badly wounded.

31:37.562 --> 31:39.439
Please, help me!

31:40.023 --> 31:41.024
Mm...

31:41.524 --> 31:42.483
No!

31:46.487 --> 31:47.947
You... took...

31:48.823 --> 31:51.200
my... seat.

31:57.165 --> 31:59.000
-Huh?

32:21.856 --> 32:23.816
- Rian, watch out!
- Ya!

32:24.859 --> 32:26.861
-Rian!
- No! Rian!

32:27.487 --> 32:28.780
Rian!

32:35.203 --> 32:36.329
Ah...

32:36.996 --> 32:39.207
-Greetings, Podling.

32:39.290 --> 32:41.125
Archer? Archer!

32:41.834 --> 32:44.921
Wait. Hup get help.

32:45.171 --> 32:48.925
-No time. Help me up.

32:49.008 --> 32:52.345
Your friends are in danger.

32:58.559 --> 32:59.686
Enough!

33:01.813 --> 33:04.649
SkekMal lives!

33:04.983 --> 33:06.818
I had a dream

33:07.110 --> 33:10.279
that I was one that became two

33:10.446 --> 33:12.448
that became one again.

33:13.032 --> 33:15.952
I looked through my dark half's eyes

33:16.744 --> 33:20.623
and knew Aughra was right.

33:20.707 --> 33:22.834
Is this your trophy, Gelfling?

33:23.251 --> 33:25.003
This toy?

33:26.963 --> 33:28.673
-No! No!

33:32.844 --> 33:33.803
Mm...

33:34.804 --> 33:37.765
The hunt must end.

33:38.266 --> 33:39.308
Mm.

33:44.188 --> 33:45.064
Rian!

33:46.566 --> 33:47.608
Let him go!

33:48.526 --> 33:49.902
Quiet, puny Gelfling!

33:50.820 --> 33:52.488
<i>I have conquered death!</i>

33:53.364 --> 33:55.950
I return more powerful than ever!

33:56.576 --> 33:59.704
<i>More powerful than Thra itself!</i>

34:00.288 --> 34:02.707
Nothing can stop the hunt!

34:03.666 --> 34:04.584
-No!

34:09.422 --> 34:11.090
Now, we shall see

34:11.382 --> 34:14.218
what lies at the dream's end.

34:28.107 --> 34:29.275
Archer!

34:29.984 --> 34:32.320
What are... what...

34:39.744 --> 34:41.788
Archer!

34:48.544 --> 34:50.004
Mm...

35:03.226 --> 35:05.686
Ah!

35:07.939 --> 35:09.690
I am reborn!

35:09.774 --> 35:12.527
Oh, no! Not her again!

35:12.610 --> 35:13.736
Praise Thra!

35:13.820 --> 35:18.616
-The witch is back!
-Does nothing stay dead anymore?

35:20.284 --> 35:22.286
Mother Aughra, are you all right?

35:22.370 --> 35:24.914
No. I just came back from the dead.

35:24.997 --> 35:27.458
-Not easy. Help me!
-Oh, yes!

35:27.959 --> 35:29.794
Mother Aughra,

35:30.086 --> 35:34.799
-I suppose this was your plan all along.
-It was, Emperor.

35:35.091 --> 35:37.426
-I wasn't sure it would work.
-Huh? Oh.

35:37.510 --> 35:40.638
Now, drag your leathery tails
back to your castle

35:41.139 --> 35:43.099
and pray I punish you no further!

35:44.183 --> 35:45.893
Hollow threats.

35:46.185 --> 35:50.857
Your hand trembles. You can barely stand!

35:50.982 --> 35:52.984
Yet I stand.

35:53.693 --> 35:55.069
Unlike the Hunter.

35:56.154 --> 35:59.157
This changes nothing!

35:59.907 --> 36:01.701
You few Gelfling...

36:02.326 --> 36:06.372
are no match for the Lords of the Crystal!

36:09.667 --> 36:10.877
Skeksis!

36:12.044 --> 36:13.337
Finish them!

36:17.008 --> 36:18.301
-Huh?

36:18.885 --> 36:21.262
The Sifa stand with the heroes of Thra!

36:23.347 --> 36:25.391
Ah, yes!

36:26.058 --> 36:26.976
Ha!

36:27.602 --> 36:29.604
The Drenchen fight for Thra!

36:32.523 --> 36:34.275
The Spriton ride to battle!

36:36.736 --> 36:39.947
-The Grottan face the suns once again!
- Ha!

36:40.323 --> 36:43.367
- Who are these?
-The Dousan heed your call.

36:46.746 --> 36:49.040
The Vapra have come for Thra!

36:49.707 --> 36:50.583
- They came!

36:50.666 --> 36:51.709
The Seven Clans!

36:54.045 --> 36:55.671
Oh! Oh!

36:57.131 --> 36:59.175
The Arathim fight by our side.

37:00.468 --> 37:01.928
Ah... ha!

37:02.011 --> 37:04.430
-We are surrounded!

37:04.513 --> 37:06.974
They are everywhere!

37:11.187 --> 37:14.774
Emperor, no choice. Skeksis must retreat.

37:14.857 --> 37:15.942
Cannot win!

37:16.317 --> 37:18.152
I will not lose.<i> </i>

37:18.236 --> 37:20.238
No matter the cost!

37:24.033 --> 37:28.871
Behold the power of the Darkening!

37:36.003 --> 37:37.755
Oh, Gelfling, get back!

37:40.091 --> 37:41.592
<i>-</i>

38:03.823 --> 38:04.657
Deet!

38:05.116 --> 38:05.950
No!

38:07.910 --> 38:09.578
Gentle Deet.

38:14.166 --> 38:15.668
-What is she doing?

38:16.711 --> 38:19.755
Stop! You're killing her!

38:21.924 --> 38:23.384
What? Huh?

38:24.176 --> 38:25.803
Ha!

38:35.062 --> 38:37.064
-No!
- How? She just...

38:41.694 --> 38:44.780
- Oh!
-Impossible!

38:52.455 --> 38:53.331
Deet?

38:54.290 --> 38:58.127
Get away... from my friends!

39:13.601 --> 39:15.936
That wasn't so bad!

39:24.528 --> 39:27.031
-Oh!

39:27.198 --> 39:29.617
-Retreat!
- To the Castle! Quickly!

39:29.700 --> 39:31.744
Retreat! Retreat!

39:31.869 --> 39:35.956
Emperor! Emperor, we must go, yes?

39:36.749 --> 39:38.584
-Ye-- Yes...
- To the castle!

39:38.667 --> 39:40.753
-My most trusted advisor.
-Yes!

39:40.836 --> 39:44.840
-To the castle!
-To the castle! Good! Good!

39:48.386 --> 39:50.262
They're running away!

39:55.643 --> 39:56.727
Ha!

39:56.852 --> 39:58.354
-Good!

39:58.562 --> 39:59.647
Yeah!

39:59.855 --> 40:01.399
Yes!

40:01.899 --> 40:03.692
-They're leaving!
-Yes!

40:04.318 --> 40:06.153
Hello! Haha!

40:17.915 --> 40:20.501
- We did it!
- Yes!

40:24.004 --> 40:25.673
-Kylan!
-Gurjin!

40:26.006 --> 40:26.966
Yes!

40:28.467 --> 40:30.511
- Oh, Naia!
-You did it.

40:37.351 --> 40:38.352
We did it.

40:38.436 --> 40:39.687
Stone-in-the-Wood
shall rise again.

40:39.770 --> 40:41.313
-Thanks to Deet.
- Were you scared?

40:44.316 --> 40:46.735
-Ah, Gurjin! You made it!
- Brea!

40:46.819 --> 40:48.863
-Deet?
- Good to see you my friend.

40:48.946 --> 40:51.490
Deet? Deet!

40:54.660 --> 40:55.536
Deet!

40:55.911 --> 40:58.038
Well done, my lad. Well done.

40:58.122 --> 40:59.665
Oh, thank you. Deet...

40:59.748 --> 41:01.542
Oh, sister!

41:01.917 --> 41:04.044
- Deet!
-Hm.

41:05.754 --> 41:07.923
Oh, Mother Aughra!

41:09.550 --> 41:11.302
I guess you want a hug, all right.

41:11.385 --> 41:12.970
Ah, the heroes of Thra, together again!

41:13.053 --> 41:15.389
Oh, Gurjin, you've made us proud!

41:16.015 --> 41:17.683
-Gurjin!
-Seladon!

41:18.392 --> 41:19.560
-Seladon!

41:21.020 --> 41:23.105
I guess everyone wants to hug a hero.

41:23.689 --> 41:25.065
-Whoa!

41:25.649 --> 41:26.734
Uh...

41:27.735 --> 41:28.986
Ah, why not?

41:33.949 --> 41:35.159
Thank you.

41:36.202 --> 41:37.536
Who's next?

41:38.037 --> 41:41.165
- Yeah! Mother Aughra, come on!
-What are you doing?

41:41.248 --> 41:44.710
Give me a moment.
I may be newborn, but I'm still old.

41:48.172 --> 41:51.467
- Yes!
- I'm moving as fast as I can.

42:28.087 --> 42:29.046
Ah...

42:29.630 --> 42:32.716
The lost shard of the Crystal of Truth...

42:33.759 --> 42:35.094
found at last.

42:37.555 --> 42:40.599
This is what the Heretic
wanted us to find.

42:41.517 --> 42:42.810
Not the weapon...

42:44.520 --> 42:45.563
but the shard.

42:47.273 --> 42:50.693
The shard is the key
to ending Skeksis power

42:50.901 --> 42:52.570
and uniting the Gelfling.

42:59.702 --> 43:00.744
Ah...

43:01.453 --> 43:02.496
Gelfling...

43:03.914 --> 43:06.041
the shard calls to you.

43:07.126 --> 43:08.836
You fought well.

43:09.295 --> 43:11.422
This day is ours.

43:11.922 --> 43:13.465
And tomorrow...

43:15.009 --> 43:19.597
<i>Tomorrow, three suns rise on a new world.</i>

43:20.931 --> 43:23.434
<i>Nothing will ever be the same.</i>

43:25.144 --> 43:27.354
<i>We have made new enemies,</i>

43:28.647 --> 43:30.774
<i>and lost old friends.</i>

43:32.067 --> 43:35.237
<i>But the fallen are not truly gone.</i>

43:37.072 --> 43:40.868
<i>They have joined</i>
<i>the song of Thra once more.</i>

43:41.827 --> 43:43.829
<i>Listen...</i>

43:43.954 --> 43:46.582
<i>-And you will hear them in the wind.</i>

43:48.000 --> 43:50.044
<i>For the song has changed.</i>

43:50.127 --> 43:51.170
Deet?

43:52.671 --> 43:53.631
Deet!

43:54.256 --> 43:56.550
<i>It sounds like hope.</i>

43:57.343 --> 43:58.344
Deet!

44:01.847 --> 44:05.684
<i></i>
<i>But take care. Hope is fragile.</i>

44:08.896 --> 44:13.442
<i>Hope is delicate, like a crystal shard.</i>

44:15.986 --> 44:17.237
Deet?

44:17.780 --> 44:19.156
<i>Once lost...</i>

44:20.949 --> 44:22.034
<i>now found.</i>

44:24.828 --> 44:26.997
<i>And easily stolen.</i>

44:44.515 --> 44:45.641
Huh?

44:52.272 --> 44:57.027
This day's victory does not belong
to a single Gelfling or a single clan.

44:57.569 --> 44:59.113
It belongs to all of us!

44:59.446 --> 45:01.532
All of Thra, united!

45:01.949 --> 45:05.577
This day, the many become one!

45:24.304 --> 45:27.433
Sublime, yes, yes! Superb!

45:28.267 --> 45:29.852
I will show them!

45:31.812 --> 45:34.064
I will build their army, yes!

45:34.440 --> 45:37.943
The greatest army that Thra has ever seen!

45:39.737 --> 45:42.406
We will rule forever!

45:49.288 --> 45:50.497
Yes...

46:01.175 --> 46:03.427
This is a dark day.

46:03.510 --> 46:05.512
Look on bright side, yes?

46:05.929 --> 46:07.973
-We still live.

46:08.891 --> 46:10.768
But for how much longer?

46:11.393 --> 46:12.936
The-- the Gelfling...

46:13.520 --> 46:14.813
they are too many.

46:15.230 --> 46:18.066
We will be overwhelmed!

46:19.276 --> 46:20.986
They will have our heads.

46:21.236 --> 46:23.822
Our beautiful heads!

46:25.866 --> 46:27.493
Poor Collector.

46:28.577 --> 46:32.164
SkekLach never harmed anyone
who did not deserve it.

46:33.332 --> 46:35.000
Where is the General?

46:36.877 --> 46:40.589
Friend General perished at Stone-in-Wood.

46:41.131 --> 46:45.677
I'm just glad I was with in...
final moments.

46:46.845 --> 46:47.805
Sad.

46:48.305 --> 46:49.264
Yes.

46:49.723 --> 46:51.141
So sad.

46:51.850 --> 46:56.522
-Ah... we are doomed!

46:56.647 --> 46:58.857
My lords, my lords...

46:59.233 --> 47:01.568
all is not lost.

47:01.652 --> 47:05.572
I have found a solution
to all our problems:

47:05.656 --> 47:10.244
an ingenious combination
of Gruenak and Arathim.

47:10.536 --> 47:13.497
I call it... Garthim!

47:21.755 --> 47:23.757
- Marvelous!
