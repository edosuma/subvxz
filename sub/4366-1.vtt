00:05.616 --> 00:08.134
When you find that one person

00:08.135 --> 00:09.736
who connects you to the world,

00:09.738 --> 00:14.323
you become someone different.

00:14.325 --> 00:19.078
Someone better.

00:19.080 --> 00:22.932
When that person is
taken from you...

00:22.934 --> 00:26.953
What do you become then?

00:33.827 --> 00:35.028
Whatever he wanna do, you know?

00:36.598 --> 00:39.465
What? Hmm?

00:39.467 --> 00:41.434
Where'd you get that,
in a cereal box?

00:41.436 --> 00:43.186
Huh? You wanna see
a real gun?

00:44.938 --> 00:46.406
Forget you.

00:46.408 --> 00:48.307
Every little punk
is carrying now, Anton.

00:48.309 --> 00:50.359
That's why your father wanted us
to take the car home.

00:50.361 --> 00:52.278
Relax.

00:52.280 --> 00:54.447
We're picking up new hardware
next week.

00:54.449 --> 00:57.116
Restore a little order.

00:57.118 --> 00:58.785
Besides, when we take the car,

00:58.787 --> 01:00.737
we don't get to meet
new friends.

01:00.739 --> 01:02.071
Look at this guy.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:15.952 --> 01:19.222
You didn't bring enough
for the whole group.

01:19.224 --> 01:21.174
I have to teach you
about sharing.

01:27.815 --> 01:29.799
Aah!

02:00.330 --> 02:04.133
I'll need a statement from the bum.
What hospital did they take him to?

02:04.135 --> 02:07.453
He declined treatment.
We got video on it, though.

02:25.489 --> 02:28.674
You know, you could have
done me a favor

02:28.676 --> 02:31.661
and let those guys land
a couple more punches.

02:31.663 --> 02:34.196
Question for you.

02:34.198 --> 02:35.464
Looking at that tape,

02:35.466 --> 02:38.417
I'd say you spent some time
in the service.

02:38.419 --> 02:41.053
But you don't learn
how to fight like that

02:41.055 --> 02:42.638
in the regular army.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.807
So what were you,
special forces?

02:44.809 --> 02:47.643
Delta?

02:49.379 --> 02:52.665
I'm Carter.
You didn't give us a name.

02:54.301 --> 02:55.434
You know, it's funny.

02:55.436 --> 02:58.321
Seems like the only time
you need a name now

02:58.323 --> 03:00.723
is when you're in trouble.

03:00.725 --> 03:02.825
So am I in trouble?

03:02.827 --> 03:05.411
I don't know, you tell me.

03:05.413 --> 03:07.446
You're the one
living on the street.

03:11.535 --> 03:15.254
Yeah, making that transition
back can be tough.

03:15.256 --> 03:18.174
Some guys I knew
got a little lost,

03:18.176 --> 03:20.676
needed a little help adjusting.

03:20.678 --> 03:24.113
You need some help?

03:29.186 --> 03:31.938
Of course,
some other guys I knew,

03:31.940 --> 03:35.274
they'd done so many
evil things,

03:35.276 --> 03:39.011
they felt like they needed
the punishment.

03:41.215 --> 03:42.932
That sound more like
your story?

03:46.536 --> 03:49.455
Excuse me for a second.

04:05.288 --> 04:08.007
I'm here for my client.

04:08.009 --> 04:09.308
Wow.

04:09.310 --> 04:11.293
Wow, wow.

04:11.295 --> 04:12.478
Your guy's prints were found

04:12.480 --> 04:14.730
in half a dozen crime scenes
over the years.

04:14.732 --> 04:17.266
Open warrants
in four different countries.

04:17.267 --> 04:19.851
Who you got down there, Carter,

04:19.853 --> 04:22.304
the angel of death?

04:22.306 --> 04:25.691
I appreciate the help,
counselor.

04:25.693 --> 04:29.445
But who's picking up...
The tab?

04:32.332 --> 04:34.133
Our employer wants
to have a word with you.

05:15.909 --> 05:17.994
Do I owe you money?

05:17.996 --> 05:19.862
'Cause I'm, uh...

05:19.864 --> 05:22.131
Running a little short
at the moment.

05:22.133 --> 05:25.167
You don't owe me anything,
Mr. Reese.

05:25.169 --> 05:28.504
That's the name
you prefer, isn't it?

05:28.506 --> 05:31.507
I know you've had several.

05:31.509 --> 05:35.261
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
tell anybody about you.

05:35.263 --> 05:39.265
You don't know anything
about me.

05:39.267 --> 05:43.218
I know exactly everything
about you, Mr. Reese.

05:43.220 --> 05:46.822
I know about the work you
used to do for the government.

05:46.824 --> 05:48.357
I know about the doubts
you came to have

05:48.359 --> 05:49.942
about that work.

05:49.944 --> 05:51.610
I know that the government,
along with everybody else,

05:51.612 --> 05:55.681
thinks you're dead.

05:55.683 --> 05:56.749
I know you've spent
the last couple of months

05:56.751 --> 06:00.786
trying to drink yourself
to death.

06:00.788 --> 06:03.589
I know you're contemplating
more efficient ways to do it.

06:03.591 --> 06:08.094
So you see,
knowledge is not my problem.

06:08.096 --> 06:11.630
Doing something
with that knowledge...

06:11.632 --> 06:16.085
That's where you'd come in.

06:16.087 --> 06:21.690
And you can call me
Mr. Finch.

06:21.692 --> 06:25.227
I think you and I can
help one another.

06:25.229 --> 06:27.063
I don't think you need
a psychiatrist

06:27.065 --> 06:29.448
or a support group, or pills...

06:29.450 --> 06:32.101
What do I need?

06:32.103 --> 06:35.821
You need a purpose.

06:35.823 --> 06:39.125
More specifically,
you need a job.

06:44.948 --> 06:48.384
Eight million people.

06:48.386 --> 06:49.685
You know what they all
have in common?

06:49.687 --> 06:53.472
None of them knows
what happens next.

06:53.474 --> 06:57.860
Someone is murdered
in New York City every 18 hours.

06:57.862 --> 06:59.361
At the end of the day,

06:59.363 --> 07:01.180
one of these people
will be gone.

07:01.182 --> 07:04.466
Bad things happen
to people every day.

07:04.468 --> 07:06.569
You can't stop that.

07:06.571 --> 07:08.320
What if you could?

07:08.322 --> 07:10.790
Not the things that happen
in the heat of the moment.

07:10.792 --> 07:13.409
But so many crimes are planned

07:13.411 --> 07:16.762
days, weeks in advance.

07:16.764 --> 07:20.533
What if you could stop those?

07:20.535 --> 07:22.168
I've got a list.

07:22.170 --> 07:24.787
A list of people who are
about to be involved

07:24.789 --> 07:27.139
in very bad situations.

07:27.141 --> 07:29.175
Murders, kidnappings.

07:29.177 --> 07:31.844
The people that are on my list,

07:31.846 --> 07:33.429
they have no idea that
anything's about

07:33.431 --> 07:34.513
to happen to them.

07:34.515 --> 07:37.383
Most of them are just
ordinary people

07:37.385 --> 07:40.970
- like her.
- Thank you.

07:40.972 --> 07:43.505
Her name is Diane Hansen,

07:43.507 --> 07:46.308
and this week she's
at the top of my list.

07:46.310 --> 07:48.477
I don't know exactly
what's going to happen

07:48.479 --> 07:50.529
or what her role in it is.

07:50.531 --> 07:54.016
She might be the victim.
She could be the perpetrator.

07:54.018 --> 07:56.485
All I know is that
she's involved.

07:56.487 --> 07:57.686
I want you to follow her,

07:57.688 --> 07:59.238
figure out what's gonna
to happen,

07:59.240 --> 08:01.790
and stop it from happening.

08:03.960 --> 08:06.128
So what do you think?

08:09.583 --> 08:11.667
I think you're
a bored rich guy.

08:11.669 --> 08:13.869
I think that woman's
probably your ex-wife

08:13.871 --> 08:15.838
or someone you rode
in an elevator with once.

08:15.840 --> 08:18.023
And either way,
I think I'm done.

08:36.693 --> 08:39.278
Tonight police are looking
for a homeless man

08:39.280 --> 08:40.696
for further questioning.

08:40.698 --> 08:42.731
The unidentified man
was originally believed

08:42.732 --> 08:44.700
to be the victim
of a violent assault

08:44.702 --> 08:45.918
on the subway.

08:45.920 --> 08:48.737
But now police consider the man
a person of interest

08:48.739 --> 08:51.573
in a number of crimes
nationwide.

09:07.607 --> 09:10.259
Hey, sweetheart, what's wrong?

09:10.261 --> 09:12.945
Jess, what's wrong?

09:29.829 --> 09:31.830
You need to understand,
Mr. Reese,

09:31.832 --> 09:33.615
the information I have
is incomplete,

09:33.617 --> 09:35.134
but it's never wrong.

09:35.136 --> 09:37.002
You need to know
what it would be like

09:37.004 --> 09:39.672
to be forced to listen
to someone get murdered,

09:39.674 --> 09:40.956
and not be able to
do anything about it.

10:05.448 --> 10:09.451
One three eight

10:09.453 --> 10:10.502
dot seven X-ray.

10:10.504 --> 10:15.658
12 August, 2008.
1:37 A.M.

10:15.660 --> 10:18.761
Too late.

10:18.763 --> 10:21.180
This recording
is three years old.

10:21.182 --> 10:26.185
A woman murdered in this room
by her husband.

10:26.187 --> 10:28.687
For the insurance.

10:28.689 --> 10:31.223
You were too late for her.

10:31.225 --> 10:33.475
Just like you were too late
for your friend Jessica.

10:33.477 --> 10:35.527
You were halfway
around the world

10:35.529 --> 10:38.030
when she was killed.

10:38.032 --> 10:40.349
What the hell
do you know about it?

10:40.351 --> 10:42.318
It's the truth.
You left the government

10:42.320 --> 10:44.320
because they lied to you--
I never will.

10:44.322 --> 10:46.521
I think all you ever wanted
to do was protect people.

10:59.502 --> 11:02.421
It's a wire-tap recording.

11:02.423 --> 11:08.477
NSA or FISA.
Government.

11:08.479 --> 11:10.346
But you're not government.

11:10.348 --> 11:12.481
No, I'm not.

11:19.222 --> 11:24.543
I guess you could call me
a concerned third party.

11:25.612 --> 11:28.397
You couldn't have saved
this woman...

11:28.399 --> 11:30.249
Or your friend.

11:30.251 --> 11:32.734
But you could have
if you had have known in time.

11:32.736 --> 11:34.870
And that's the other thing
I'm offering you,

11:34.872 --> 11:37.289
a chance to be there in time.

11:41.761 --> 11:44.713
It's not too late for her.

11:44.715 --> 11:46.765
You could help me stop
what's about to happen.

11:46.767 --> 11:49.201
The question is, will you?

11:57.705 --> 12:01.261
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

12:08.501 --> 12:10.335
What is this place?

12:10.337 --> 12:13.505
The decline
of Western civilization.

12:13.507 --> 12:16.341
The city closed
half its libraries.

12:16.343 --> 12:17.676
Budget cuts.

12:17.678 --> 12:22.514
This building was sold
to a bank that I control,

12:22.516 --> 12:25.100
which promptly declared
bankruptcy.

12:25.102 --> 12:27.802
So the property's in
a kind of limbo.

12:27.804 --> 12:29.855
It doesn't exist.

12:29.857 --> 12:33.275
Neither do you.
I did a little digging.

12:33.277 --> 12:36.411
I recognize, Mr. Reese,
that there's a disparity

12:36.413 --> 12:38.497
between how much
I know about you

12:38.499 --> 12:40.365
and how much you know about me.

12:40.367 --> 12:42.367
I know you'll be trying
to close that gap

12:42.369 --> 12:44.002
as quickly as possible.

12:44.004 --> 12:50.208
But I should tell you
I'm a really private person.

12:50.210 --> 12:53.628
Drivers licenses...
Credit cards.

12:53.630 --> 12:56.815
Six cover identities.

12:56.817 --> 13:00.685
Funds to be replenished
through a proxy corporation.

13:00.687 --> 13:04.439
Just like when you were
with the agency.

13:04.441 --> 13:05.724
When I was with the agency

13:05.726 --> 13:09.327
I knew who was
picking up the tab.

13:09.329 --> 13:11.646
This is your list?

13:11.648 --> 13:12.864
<i>The</i> list?

13:12.866 --> 13:13.932
Yeah.

13:13.934 --> 13:17.769
But you don't get names,
do you?

13:17.771 --> 13:20.521
These are social security
numbers.

13:20.523 --> 13:25.827
And each of them map out
to a violent crime.

13:25.829 --> 13:27.762
And all of these numbers
represent...

13:27.764 --> 13:29.898
Lost chances.

13:29.900 --> 13:31.366
I could be
a lot more help to you

13:31.368 --> 13:33.835
if you just tell me where
you're getting these numbers.

13:33.837 --> 13:35.253
It doesn't really matter
where I get the numbers.

13:35.255 --> 13:37.038
What you need to know is that
the next number that's up

13:37.040 --> 13:41.259
is hers.

13:45.264 --> 13:48.099
Diane Hansen.

13:48.101 --> 13:51.152
Grew up in Detroit.

13:51.154 --> 13:53.271
Moved to the city
after law school.

13:53.273 --> 13:54.906
Single.

13:54.908 --> 13:57.158
- She have any enemies?
- One or two.

13:57.160 --> 13:59.361
She's an assistant
district attorney.

13:59.363 --> 14:01.646
Best conviction record
in her department.

14:01.648 --> 14:04.416
We have no idea when this
bad thing might happen, huh?

14:04.418 --> 14:07.669
Could be in a week.
Could be five minutes.

14:07.671 --> 14:09.504
That's why we need to learn
as much as we can about her.

14:09.506 --> 14:12.357
How do you intend to begin?

14:12.359 --> 14:14.042
The slow way.

14:14.044 --> 14:15.176
Cultivate a relationship

14:15.178 --> 14:18.413
to allow you to earn
the asset's trust.

14:18.415 --> 14:20.949
And the fast way?

14:22.418 --> 14:25.020
First, you break
into their home

14:25.022 --> 14:27.672
and go through all their stuff.

14:30.526 --> 14:34.145
Email, financial records,
personal effects.

14:37.566 --> 14:41.953
Then you hack
into their cell phone.

14:41.955 --> 14:44.772
As long as it's charged
and has signal,

14:44.774 --> 14:47.542
you can use the GPS
to track them.

14:51.631 --> 14:53.632
You can use the microphone to
listen into their conversations

14:53.634 --> 14:55.600
whether they're talking
on the phone or not.

14:55.602 --> 14:58.253
Hi, mom. I'm sorry
I haven't called you back...

14:58.255 --> 14:59.638
Third step--

14:59.640 --> 15:01.473
You need picture.

15:01.475 --> 15:03.441
A wireless camera,
and you can keep an eye on them

15:03.443 --> 15:04.676
from anywhere.

15:04.678 --> 15:08.563
I know you're worried.
I know. I'm fine.

15:08.565 --> 15:10.198
It is a tough job,
but I can look after myself.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.183
You know that.

15:12.185 --> 15:15.820
She's tough, but she's scared
about something.

15:15.822 --> 15:18.740
Given Hansen's job,
we've got hundreds of people

15:18.742 --> 15:21.476
who could be holding a grudge.

15:21.478 --> 15:23.161
I cut the list to two.

15:23.163 --> 15:25.613
The first is Wheeler,
her co-counselor.

15:25.615 --> 15:28.033
They dated for a few months
last year.

15:28.035 --> 15:30.151
She broke things off.

15:30.153 --> 15:32.653
You got time to talk?
Maybe I can buy you dinner.

15:32.655 --> 15:34.255
I'm busy. Another time?

15:34.257 --> 15:36.291
Is something wrong?
I've been noticing lately--

15:36.293 --> 15:38.326
No, I'm fine, thank you.
Thanks.

15:38.328 --> 15:40.095
And 40% of murders involve

15:40.097 --> 15:43.498
some kind of romantic
relationship.

15:43.500 --> 15:45.166
Wheeler's divorced.
One kid.

15:45.168 --> 15:48.186
Partial custody, alimony.
Career stalled.

15:48.188 --> 15:51.740
The second person I'm
looking into is Lawrence Pope.

15:51.742 --> 15:54.192
The man Hansen
is currently prosecuting.

15:54.194 --> 15:55.927
Pope's on trial
for killing his friends

15:55.929 --> 15:57.462
in a drug deal gone bad.

15:57.464 --> 15:59.247
Stole $1/2 million in cash.

15:59.249 --> 16:03.435
Pope's gang may be
targeting her for reprisal.

16:03.437 --> 16:05.920
When we got there,
the scene was colorful.

16:05.922 --> 16:07.322
Five dead.

16:07.324 --> 16:09.207
One of them had managed
to crawl ten feet to a phone

16:09.209 --> 16:10.492
to dial 911.

16:10.494 --> 16:13.361
Detective Fusco,
when you interviewed Mr. Pope,

16:13.363 --> 16:15.029
what did he tell you
in his defense?

16:15.031 --> 16:17.198
He said that if he'd have
shot the poor bastard,

16:17.200 --> 16:18.466
he would have shot him
in the head.

16:18.468 --> 16:22.587
Quote, "same as I always do,"
unquote.

16:22.589 --> 16:24.038
He said he wouldn't have
left him there half-dead,

16:24.040 --> 16:25.423
blubbering for his girlfriend.

16:29.378 --> 16:32.063
No more questions, your honor.

16:35.101 --> 16:37.685
Detective...

16:37.687 --> 16:39.821
You went a little off script
in your testimony.

16:39.823 --> 16:42.023
You never told me about
that conversation,

16:42.025 --> 16:43.724
and it could clear Pope's name.

16:43.726 --> 16:46.611
What's it matter?
We got the guy.

16:46.613 --> 16:48.747
It matters because it's my job

16:48.749 --> 16:49.864
to make absolutely sure

16:49.866 --> 16:51.249
that the wrong people
don't go to jail.

16:51.251 --> 16:52.567
Do you remember?

16:52.569 --> 16:55.120
Excuse me, I thought
we were on the same team.

16:57.406 --> 16:59.924
Something's gone wrong
with her case.

17:02.744 --> 17:05.195
Hansen's on the move.

17:05.198 --> 17:06.631
She's phoning county lockup,

17:06.633 --> 17:11.136
arranging a meeting
with Pope...Alone.

17:11.137 --> 17:13.253
Isn't my lawyer supposed
to be here for this?

17:13.256 --> 17:15.940
I can call him if you want,
but the reason I'm here is

17:15.942 --> 17:17.858
I don't think
you murdered those people.

17:17.861 --> 17:20.228
I think somebody else
was in the house

17:20.230 --> 17:22.196
when that 911 call was made.

17:22.199 --> 17:23.531
Somebody who told you
what was said,

17:23.532 --> 17:26.733
which means you weren't there.

17:26.736 --> 17:27.919
Is it somebody
you're trying to protect?

17:27.921 --> 17:30.822
You gonna help me?
Is that it?

17:30.824 --> 17:32.207
The person who knows
what happened that night

17:32.209 --> 17:33.792
must be somebody
you care about.

17:33.794 --> 17:36.127
Is it your younger brother
Michael?

17:36.129 --> 17:38.946
Pope's got a brother.
It's in his case file.

17:38.948 --> 17:40.114
Got it.

17:40.116 --> 17:41.883
Did he see the real killers?

17:41.885 --> 17:43.284
You should
leave this alone, lady.

17:43.286 --> 17:44.969
I can do the time.

17:44.971 --> 17:48.173
These people are evil,
killing when they want.

17:48.175 --> 17:49.557
And they're protected
from on high.

17:49.559 --> 17:50.791
You keep asking questions,
they'll kill me

17:50.793 --> 17:52.510
and my brother,
and probably you too.

17:52.512 --> 17:54.929
Whoever these people are,
you can trust me.

17:54.931 --> 17:59.517
We'll take care of you
and your brother.

17:59.519 --> 18:02.070
If the killers are out there,
I'm gonna find them,

18:02.072 --> 18:03.304
whether you help me or not.

18:03.306 --> 18:05.023
It's my job.
Now, why don't you--

18:05.025 --> 18:07.909
Bitch, you keep
your damn mouth shut,

18:07.911 --> 18:09.944
or I'll shut it for you!

18:15.167 --> 18:16.251
I'm fine.

18:16.253 --> 18:17.919
Okay. She's okay.
She's okay.

18:17.921 --> 18:19.787
Finch, you were right
about Hansen.

18:19.789 --> 18:22.257
Whoever framed Pope
will be coming after her,

18:22.259 --> 18:25.710
and only Pope's brother Michael
knows who they are.

18:35.084 --> 18:37.300
Hi, mom, it's Jessica.

18:37.302 --> 18:39.503
I'm just down in Mexico
with Cindy,

18:39.505 --> 18:42.005
and I'll be back tomorrow.
Okay?

18:42.007 --> 18:43.590
- Talk soon. Bye.
- Cindy?

18:43.592 --> 18:44.874
Yeah.

18:44.876 --> 18:47.144
- I look like a Cindy?
- Yeah.

18:47.146 --> 18:50.213
I didn't tell her about us yet.

18:50.215 --> 18:53.517
It's been six months.

18:53.519 --> 18:59.823
I wish this weekend
could go on forever.

18:59.825 --> 19:04.027
It already has.
It's Tuesday.

19:04.029 --> 19:06.563
Yes, which means that you
have to go back to the base,

19:06.565 --> 19:09.866
and I'm not gonna see you again
for two weeks, which I hate.

19:09.868 --> 19:13.670
Then ask me to stay,
and I will.

19:13.672 --> 19:17.524
I'll quit.
I'll quit.

19:17.526 --> 19:18.592
- Okay.
- I'll quit.

19:18.594 --> 19:22.546
- Then quit.
- I already did.

19:22.548 --> 19:27.250
- What?
- Yeah.

19:27.252 --> 19:30.020
I didn't want
to take the chance

19:30.022 --> 19:34.558
that you wouldn't be here
when I got back.

19:37.863 --> 19:39.596
But first,
we need some more Tequila.

19:39.598 --> 19:40.781
Unh!

19:43.151 --> 19:48.822
<i>Estamos recibiendo informes
que unos aviones se han estrellado</i>

19:48.824 --> 19:50.373
contra las dos torres gemelas del
World Trade Center en Manhattan.

19:50.375 --> 19:52.742
Hey, sweetheart, what's wrong?

19:52.744 --> 19:55.712
Jess...What's wrong?

19:55.714 --> 19:59.049
Uh, it's New York.
I don't know. I don't know.

19:59.051 --> 20:02.502
Something's happened
this morning.

20:02.504 --> 20:03.804
Is it a plane crash?

20:03.806 --> 20:08.124
I think it's two.
I think it's two planes.

20:15.851 --> 20:20.487
All right, thanks.

20:20.489 --> 20:22.022
You went to see Pope
last night?

20:22.024 --> 20:23.640
Yeah. I gave him
one more chance

20:23.642 --> 20:25.759
to turn in his accomplice,
cut a deal.

20:25.761 --> 20:27.327
He give you anything?

20:27.329 --> 20:28.829
No. As usual.

20:28.831 --> 20:33.983
I'm, uh-- I'm late.

20:33.985 --> 20:36.486
She's trying to track down
Pope's brother Michael.

20:36.488 --> 20:38.839
He can ID the real killers.

20:38.841 --> 20:41.291
And she's stonewalling Wheeler.

20:41.293 --> 20:42.976
What, does she think
he's involved?

20:42.978 --> 20:46.429
Remember, Pope said they were
protected from on high.

20:50.885 --> 20:55.388
Wait a second.

20:55.390 --> 20:57.357
Turns out there's a good reason
she doesn't trust Wheeler.

20:57.359 --> 21:00.076
He might be working
with the killers.

21:00.078 --> 21:03.113
And they're after Michael Pope.

21:03.115 --> 21:06.783
We better get to this kid
before someone else does.

21:21.749 --> 21:24.834
Michael...Can I talk to you
for a second?

21:42.169 --> 21:43.603
I've got a message
from your brother.

21:43.605 --> 21:45.655
- You don't know my brother.
- Not exactly.

21:45.657 --> 21:46.656
But I know what you saw.

21:46.658 --> 21:48.057
I'm not the only one
looking for you.

to put me

21:56.335 --> 21:57.367
in a taxi cab with him!

21:57.369 --> 22:00.704
He's trying to
take pictures of me.

22:00.706 --> 22:01.955
What's going on?

22:01.957 --> 22:03.873
How you doing?

22:05.509 --> 22:07.377
Michael Pope's
still on the subway.

22:07.379 --> 22:08.545
When he comes up for air,

22:08.547 --> 22:10.880
you can use the GPS
on your phone to find him.

22:10.882 --> 22:12.499
If Pope's right
about these guys,

22:12.501 --> 22:14.584
I'm gonna need a hell of a lot
more than a cell phone.

22:14.586 --> 22:18.087
About that, I don't like
firearms very much.

22:18.089 --> 22:19.422
Well, neither do I,

I'd rather it was me.

the subway has a line on some.

casing right into your face.

When the towers came down,

26:21.028 --> 26:23.779
you were in a hotel in Mexico.

26:23.781 --> 26:25.781
I was here.

26:25.783 --> 26:28.567
I was working.

26:28.569 --> 26:31.353
Didn't even know about

You see, Mr. Reese,
until that day,

26:34.692 --> 26:37.710
I had spent the better part of
my life making myself very rich.

26:37.712 --> 26:42.047
Suddenly all that money
didn't seem to amount to much.

26:42.049 --> 26:43.399
After the attacks,

26:43.401 --> 26:47.086
the government gave itself
the power to read every email,

26:47.088 --> 26:49.888
listen to every cell phone,

26:49.890 --> 26:52.925
but they needed something
that could sort through it all,

26:52.927 --> 26:54.727
something that could
pick the terrorists

26:54.729 --> 26:57.546
out of the general population
before they could act.

26:57.548 --> 26:59.648
The public wanted
to be protected.

26:59.650 --> 27:03.135
They just didn't want to know
how they were being protected.

27:03.137 --> 27:06.054
So when they finally
got a system that worked,

27:06.056 --> 27:08.107
they kept it secret.

27:08.109 --> 27:10.526
So how do you know about it?

27:10.528 --> 27:13.912
I built it.

27:16.666 --> 27:20.586
But there was a problem
with this machine.

27:20.588 --> 27:23.706
I had built it
to prevent the next 9/11.

27:23.708 --> 27:27.626
But it was seeing
all sorts of crimes.

27:27.628 --> 27:30.679
So I had to teach the machine

27:30.681 --> 27:33.415
to divide the things it saw
into two lists:

27:33.417 --> 27:37.102
Relevant and irrelevant.

27:37.104 --> 27:40.556
Events that would cause massive
loss of life were relevant,

to the NSA or the FBI.

28:02.930 --> 28:05.581
So where's the machine now?

28:05.583 --> 28:07.583
What, the drives?
Who knows?

28:07.585 --> 28:09.952
Government facility somewhere.

28:24.268 --> 28:26.652

about sending email?

28:26.654 --> 28:27.936
Three weeks,
you could practically move in.

28:27.938 --> 28:31.640
Never put anything in an email
you cannot own.

28:31.642 --> 28:33.575

to communicate with it?

28:33.577 --> 28:37.529

a tool of unimaginable power.

28:37.531 --> 28:41.333
I thought maybe an off switch
would come in handy.

28:41.335 --> 28:44.453

a back door into it.

28:44.455 --> 28:45.871

28:45.873 --> 28:49.541
Just a social security number.
