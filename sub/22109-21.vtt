00:03.003 --> 00:04.972
*

00:05.005 --> 00:06.340
(grunts)

00:06.374 --> 00:07.875
(tires screech)

00:09.410 --> 00:11.479
D'oh!

00:11.512 --> 00:13.081
(grunts)

00:16.684 --> 00:18.686
*

00:26.460 --> 00:29.029
-No electricity.
-D'oh!

00:35.803 --> 00:37.971
(thunder rumbling)

00:39.973 --> 00:43.677
Hardest test in the world?
Who'd want to do that?

00:43.711 --> 00:45.179
(laughs excitedly)

00:45.213 --> 00:46.414
(sighs)

00:46.447 --> 00:48.449
Oh, hey, Bart. What you doing?

00:48.482 --> 00:50.884
They say this one single test

00:50.918 --> 00:52.953
can tell if you're
a genius or not.

00:52.986 --> 00:54.855
Huh. Looks pretty simple to me.

00:54.888 --> 00:57.558
It says only one
out of every 400 people

00:57.591 --> 01:01.362
has the "spatial reasoning"
to solve this maze.

01:01.395 --> 01:04.232
Elon Musk and "Anjela" Merkel
both got perfect scores.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.066
Angela. Angela.

01:06.100 --> 01:09.036
Oh, if you're so smart,
let's see you solve the maze.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.139
Let me at it!

01:11.172 --> 01:13.141
(relaxing classical music
playing)

01:15.776 --> 01:17.978
Okay, got through the first one.

01:18.011 --> 01:21.449
Next one's a little harder.
Just gonna focus.

01:21.482 --> 01:24.118
-(zombie roars)
-(Lisa screams)

01:24.152 --> 01:26.387
(Lisa grumbling)

01:26.420 --> 01:29.290
(laughs)
You passed the test, genius.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.091
Epic sister fail!

01:31.125 --> 01:32.993
You better not post that!

01:33.026 --> 01:36.063
And... post. (laughs)

01:36.096 --> 01:40.934
(groans) You scared me and
denied me a genius test! Ooh!

01:40.968 --> 01:42.936
Well, when you got
an opportunity to prank,

01:42.970 --> 01:44.272
you gotta take it.

01:44.305 --> 01:45.673
Gotta take it.

01:45.706 --> 01:48.442
-(phone chiming)
-And the likes are pouring in.

01:48.476 --> 01:52.012
Whoa! Sideshow Mel retweeted it
to all his boneheads.

01:52.045 --> 01:53.113
(pounding on door)

01:53.147 --> 01:54.815
KRUSTY:
Are you almost done?

01:54.848 --> 01:57.851
You have your office.
This is mine!

01:57.885 --> 01:59.853
(phone chiming)

01:59.887 --> 02:01.489
(laughs)

02:01.522 --> 02:04.992
I don't know how,
I don't know when,

02:05.025 --> 02:09.797
but I super know why I'll get
revenge on you, Bart Simpson.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.500
Will you be wearing my
underpants when that happens?

02:12.533 --> 02:15.002
-Ew! (screaming)
-And post.

02:15.035 --> 02:18.005
Post. Post. Post.

02:18.038 --> 02:21.475
Unpost! Unpost!

02:21.509 --> 02:23.444
-And post.
-(groans)

02:23.477 --> 02:25.546
(organ playing "Charge" over TV)

02:25.579 --> 02:27.181
(Marge humming)

02:28.982 --> 02:31.219
HOMER/MARGE/BART/LISA:
The Internet is down!

02:31.252 --> 02:32.486
I don't know the score.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.288
I don't even remember
who's playing.

02:34.322 --> 02:36.023
(stammers)

02:36.056 --> 02:37.825
Okay, no Internet.

02:37.858 --> 02:40.361
We can do what we did
in the olden days,

02:40.394 --> 02:42.863
when I was a child.
(chuckles)

02:42.896 --> 02:45.566
You better not be suggesting
a board game.

02:45.599 --> 02:48.569
I'm not playing anything
with you ever again.

02:48.602 --> 02:51.038
Okay, fine. No board games.

02:51.071 --> 02:53.040
HOMER:
Dumb. Useless.

02:53.073 --> 02:55.476
Piece missing.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.478
So flammable.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.580
Okay, look, the TV still works,

02:59.613 --> 03:02.383
and I know we've seen
all our DVDs a hundred times,

03:02.416 --> 03:05.152
so this could be
the perfect time to break out...

03:05.185 --> 03:07.688
Daddy's VHS collection.

03:07.721 --> 03:10.224
Classic moments from a time
when people used to

03:10.258 --> 03:13.827
tape the shows they loved,
then never watch the tape again.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.162
Family Matters?

03:15.195 --> 03:17.030
It certainly does.

03:17.064 --> 03:18.532
The Tracey Ullman Show?

03:18.566 --> 03:20.534
(imitates Walter Matthau):
Well, I've had my fill.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.002
Saved by the Bell?

03:22.035 --> 03:25.172
The hit show
that launched no one's career.

03:25.205 --> 03:28.442
Now for the simple task
of hooking up the VCR.

03:28.476 --> 03:32.413
Okay, I need to connect
magenta to magenta,

03:32.446 --> 03:34.181
set the tracking.

03:34.214 --> 03:37.217
Marge, did I record these
in long play or extended play?

03:37.251 --> 03:40.120
-What's the difference?
-Long is shorter.

03:40.153 --> 03:43.123
Gross!
The remote has a cord on it.

03:43.156 --> 03:45.359
My first remote.

03:45.393 --> 03:48.529
Coincidentally,
the same time I got fat.

03:48.562 --> 03:49.963
(VCR whirring)

03:49.997 --> 03:51.632
(gasps)
What is that noise?

03:51.665 --> 03:53.267
It's rewinding.

03:53.301 --> 03:55.969
Listen to it speed up
as it gets closer.

03:56.003 --> 03:58.739
(whirring speeds up,
clicks, stops)

03:58.772 --> 04:00.641
ALL:
Ooh!

04:00.674 --> 04:02.242
Well, that was fun.
Good night.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.011
No, now we play it.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.780
(alpenhorn blows)

04:06.814 --> 04:09.917
* Ri-cola! *

04:09.950 --> 04:12.420
I used to love that commercial.

04:12.453 --> 04:15.155
Remember when I went as the horn
for Halloween?

04:15.188 --> 04:17.558
* Ri-cola! *

04:17.591 --> 04:19.593
(imitates alpenhorn)

04:19.627 --> 04:21.429
(Homer and Marge laugh)

04:21.462 --> 04:23.163
(thunder rumbling)

04:23.196 --> 04:26.800
* Let's get physical, physical *

04:26.834 --> 04:30.270
* I want to get physical... *

04:30.304 --> 04:31.872
(Bart and Lisa grunting)

04:36.276 --> 04:38.145
No worries.

04:38.178 --> 04:40.748
We just have to find
a VCR repair store.

04:40.781 --> 04:44.151
I'll look online, which I can't
because there's no Internet!

04:44.184 --> 04:46.520
Damn it!
Lisa, solve this.

04:46.554 --> 04:48.989
I've solved
enough puzzles today.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.591
(blows raspberries)

04:50.624 --> 04:52.259
-(humming)
-(organ music playing)

04:52.292 --> 04:54.328
Well, Flanders' network
is working.

04:54.362 --> 04:55.996
Maybe we could ask him
for the password.

04:56.029 --> 04:59.500
You can't just ask someone
for their password. That's rude.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.469
Come on, boy,
let's go borrow his router.

05:01.502 --> 05:03.604
How come all our father-son
activities involve

05:03.637 --> 05:05.205
getting a TV back on?

05:05.238 --> 05:07.875
What about the time I watched
you get out of that thing?

05:07.908 --> 05:10.378
-You mean when I was born?
-That was fun.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.380
(thunder rumbling)

05:15.883 --> 05:18.118
If I die before I wake,

05:18.151 --> 05:21.689
I pray the Lord
my soul to take. Amen.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.190
That's right, boys.

05:23.223 --> 05:27.094
Think about your possible deaths
as you go to sleep.

05:29.663 --> 05:32.833
Now let's look at my plans.

05:32.866 --> 05:35.603
(muffled talking)

05:36.837 --> 05:38.238
(creaking)

05:38.271 --> 05:41.375
Who's this ladder
made for, babies?

05:41.409 --> 05:43.243
D'oh!

05:46.013 --> 05:49.149
-You'll have to climb it, boy.
-I'm a little scared.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.652
Scared? What do we give you
those meds for?

05:51.685 --> 05:53.253
So you can do less parenting?

05:53.286 --> 05:55.889
(chuckles)
Babysitter in a bottle.

05:55.923 --> 05:58.426
Now climb the ladder.

06:01.395 --> 06:04.364
(heavenly choir sings)

06:04.398 --> 06:06.600
So beautiful.

06:06.634 --> 06:09.737
Almost there. You just need
to go up the last rung.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.839
That's not a rung, it's the top.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.374
-The top is a rung.
-No, it's not!

06:14.408 --> 06:17.077
-Let me check on Google.
-We don't have Internet!

06:17.110 --> 06:19.346
Maybe if I keep refreshing,
it'll come back.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.049
Refresh. Refresh. Refresh.

06:22.082 --> 06:25.753
Refresh. Refresh.
Refresh.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.020
Oh, this is pointless.

06:27.054 --> 06:30.424
Refresh. Refresh. Refresh.

06:30.458 --> 06:31.959
Ooh! No.

06:31.992 --> 06:35.429
Refresh. Refresh. Refresh.

06:35.463 --> 06:36.797
(whimpering)

06:39.132 --> 06:41.201
MARGE (in distance):
You guys need jackets!

06:41.234 --> 06:43.236
No, we're fine! D'oh!

06:45.272 --> 06:48.241
MARGE:
The Internet's back on!

06:49.910 --> 06:51.545
(bell ringing,
circus music playing)

06:51.579 --> 06:53.814
Hmm.

06:56.316 --> 06:58.786
Doctor, is he gonna
be all right?

06:58.819 --> 07:00.954
Millions of volts
coursed through his body.

07:00.988 --> 07:03.123
But it was the amps
that really messed with him.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.493
But he should be fine.
According to his chart,

07:05.526 --> 07:07.961
Bart's had more comas
than he's had hot breakfasts.

07:07.995 --> 07:10.330
Well, I can't cook
every morning.

07:10.363 --> 07:12.232
Until he recovers,
just talk to him.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.468
Lightning victims
are highly suggestible.

07:14.502 --> 07:17.938
Your kind words could turn
his coma into a trip to Hawaii,

07:17.971 --> 07:20.273
or a golf excursion
to St. Andrews,

07:20.307 --> 07:22.576
which is where I'm heading now.
(laughs)

07:22.610 --> 07:24.612
(Marge grumbles)

07:26.680 --> 07:28.315
(Lisa whimpers)

07:28.348 --> 07:30.250
Well, when you got
an opportunity to prank,

07:30.283 --> 07:31.652
you gotta take it.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.286
Gotta take it.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.122
But you're in a coma.

07:35.155 --> 07:37.090
(clucking like a chicken)

07:37.124 --> 07:39.126
Fine, I'll get revenge.

07:41.128 --> 07:45.633
(quietly): You're gonna see
dragons with pools of blood.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.801
Oh, right, you like that.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.937
Okay, scratch the dragons.

07:49.970 --> 07:53.774
You're gonna see the one thing
everyone's afraid of: death.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.944
And dead people.
That's right, buddy.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.979
(classical music playing)

08:01.481 --> 08:03.450
SINGERS (Itchy & Scratchy
theme): * Right and left *

08:03.483 --> 08:05.519
* And right and right and left *

08:05.553 --> 08:07.855
* Left, left, left,
right, right, right *

08:07.888 --> 08:11.692
* It's Bart's
unconscious brain! *

08:14.862 --> 08:18.799
Okay, Bart,
your nightmare begins.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.001
(imitates thunder)

08:21.034 --> 08:23.470
(thunder rumbling)

08:23.503 --> 08:26.039
(gasps):
Whoa! What happened?

08:26.073 --> 08:28.742
How long was I out?

08:34.514 --> 08:36.249
(door creaks)

08:37.918 --> 08:40.754
(gasps) Maude Flanders!
I thought you were dead!

08:40.788 --> 08:43.591
I am.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.993
(eerie howling)

08:46.026 --> 08:47.494
(screams)

08:47.527 --> 08:50.163
Sweetie, we're gonna
get something to eat.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.833
-You want to come?
-I'd rather stay with Bart.

08:52.866 --> 08:56.236
In fact, I'd like to stay
with him all night.

08:56.269 --> 08:59.740
-Such a sweet girl.
-So sweet.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.208
(Bart groans)

09:04.444 --> 09:08.248
Aw, someone's not happy.

09:08.281 --> 09:11.351
You know, that sign
should be unnecessary.

09:11.384 --> 09:14.922
-I'd better cheer him up.
-(phone chimes)

09:16.389 --> 09:19.026
(shouts)
I'm going to add to your dream

09:19.059 --> 09:21.394
the worst thing I can imagine!

09:21.428 --> 09:23.731
Let me see. Let me see.

09:23.764 --> 09:27.067
Wazzup...?!

09:27.100 --> 09:29.136
Milhouse.

09:29.169 --> 09:32.405
*

09:32.439 --> 09:34.808
What's going on, Bart?

09:34.842 --> 09:38.078
Are you into God now?
I always was.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.080
Look at those abs.

09:40.113 --> 09:43.316
The secret is
less loaves, more fishes.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.085
I don't believe in
some dopey religion.

09:45.118 --> 09:47.254
This is to keep out ghosts.

09:47.287 --> 09:51.158
Oh, this looks just like
my first apartment with Ned.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.160
I'm never leaving!

09:53.193 --> 09:54.928
Milhouse, have you ever
been haunted?

09:54.962 --> 09:58.098
Once, my hamster died
and then came back.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.100
Actually, my parents
bought a new one

10:00.133 --> 10:01.735
and thought I wouldn't know.

10:01.769 --> 10:04.504
Then my dad's check bounced,
and they repo'd the hamster.

10:04.537 --> 10:06.840
You've got to talk to me, Bart.

10:06.874 --> 10:10.110
Leave me alone.
Leave me alone!

10:10.143 --> 10:12.412
The power of Homer's socks
compels you!

10:12.445 --> 10:14.314
(Maude screams)

10:14.347 --> 10:17.450
Maybe you could use this,
my therapist.

10:17.484 --> 10:19.419
If you see him,
can you give him this?

10:19.452 --> 10:21.521
Don't tell him
I forgot to bring it back.

10:21.554 --> 10:23.456
He'll say I kept it
to get attention.

10:23.490 --> 10:27.360
I don't need attention, Dr. Sam!

10:27.394 --> 10:29.863
I knew it was Milhouse.
I knew it!

10:29.897 --> 10:31.531
What's on your mind, son?

10:31.564 --> 10:34.467
I'm scared to say.
You'll toss me in the loony bin.

10:34.501 --> 10:37.470
(chuckles) Bart, these days,
there are no more loony bins.

10:37.504 --> 10:39.539
All those people
are on the streets.

10:39.572 --> 10:42.976
-So how can I help you?
-I've been talking to a ghost.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.445
I know, you think I'm
the nuttiest kid you've seen.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.380
Oh, please, I can't tell you
what a relief it is

10:47.414 --> 10:49.149
to not be talking to Milhouse.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.218
Are you allowed
to say stuff like that?

10:51.251 --> 10:52.552
No, but screw it.

10:52.585 --> 10:54.221
(imitating Milhouse):
"My mom found

10:54.254 --> 10:56.724
my dad's other cell phone,
boo-hoo."

10:56.757 --> 10:58.525
(both laugh)

10:58.558 --> 11:00.160
So you don't think I'm crazy?

11:00.193 --> 11:02.495
No. Take a look
behind the couch.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.766
(gasps)

11:06.934 --> 11:08.635
You're dead, too?

11:08.668 --> 11:11.071
Yeah, I killed myself five
minutes before you got here.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.173
Why would you kill yourself?

11:13.206 --> 11:16.243
Oh, I want my patients to think
it's all their fault. (laughs)

11:16.276 --> 11:18.578
Oh, if you'd been on time,
you might've saved my life,

11:18.611 --> 11:19.813
but, you know, whatever.

11:19.847 --> 11:23.016
(groans)
Why is this happening to me?

11:23.050 --> 11:24.918
I don't know,
but you have a gift!

11:24.952 --> 11:27.254
You can see the dead, Bart.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.922
Why am I waiting for a bus?

11:28.956 --> 11:31.191
I can appear and disappear
whenever I want.

11:31.224 --> 11:33.226
And it's late.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.564
Eh, that's far enough.

11:37.597 --> 11:40.734
And, Bart, you can
help us ghosts move on to

11:40.768 --> 11:42.602
what comes next.

11:42.635 --> 11:44.537
By telling your family
you love them?

11:44.571 --> 11:46.706
Uh, which family?
I've led a complicated life.

11:46.740 --> 11:49.709
No, to move on, I need you
to get revenge on Dr. Morton,

11:49.743 --> 11:51.278
with whom I share the office.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.746
What have you got against him?

11:52.780 --> 11:55.916
He won't shut up
about his Tesla.

11:58.651 --> 12:01.621
Yes, yes, just as smart
as I always thought I...

12:01.654 --> 12:04.958
-(zombie roars)
-(screams)

12:04.992 --> 12:07.460
Thank you, Bart.
Now I can move on.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.797
Uh-oh.

12:09.830 --> 12:13.300
Wow, helping him
felt really good.

12:13.333 --> 12:16.303
-Help us, Bart.
-Help us.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.605
Settle our beefs.

12:18.638 --> 12:20.740
Beefs!

12:20.774 --> 12:24.377
* Please help me get vengeance
against all jet engines *

12:24.411 --> 12:27.314
* And then I will go to hell. *

12:27.347 --> 12:29.950
Didn't anybody finish
their business before dying?

12:29.983 --> 12:32.052
All I want to do
is return this hatchet.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.553
(sighs) Fine.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.588
Okay, I want you
to whack Johnny Tightlips,

12:35.622 --> 12:38.725
ice Fat Tony and put a hit
on Joey Doublecross.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.828
Who would've figured
he'd rat me out?

12:43.663 --> 12:45.132
Ow!

12:49.702 --> 12:51.704
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Next.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.492
You can't keep ignoring me!

13:12.525 --> 13:14.261
(Bart groaning)

13:14.294 --> 13:18.265
Um, Doctor, shouldn't he have
woken up by now?

13:18.298 --> 13:20.200
Yes, he should.

13:20.233 --> 13:23.303
Unless someone's been
telling him bad things.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.472
-What do you mean?
-Anything negative someone says

13:25.505 --> 13:27.607
could do permanent damage
to his brain function.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.442
It could even kill him.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.344
But you said he'd be fine!

13:31.378 --> 13:33.113
I said he'd be fine
if you told him

13:33.146 --> 13:35.315
he was at
a dolphin encounter on Maui.

13:35.348 --> 13:39.352
But those dolphins aren't fine!
They try to kill themselves!

13:39.386 --> 13:42.389
I said he'd be fine,
not the dolphins.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.024
Oh. Oh, no. Oh.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.693
Bart! Bart. I'm sorry.

13:46.726 --> 13:49.729
I'm so sorry.
I'll watch everything I say.

13:49.762 --> 13:52.699
(groans) I had to walk
nine blocks to get this.

13:52.732 --> 13:55.035
-I am dead.
-(Bart shouts)

13:55.068 --> 13:57.070
-Dad, no!
-Nine blocks.

13:57.104 --> 13:59.239
I am dead.

13:59.272 --> 14:02.142
Dead, dead.
Dead, dead, dead.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.911
(Lisa gasps)

14:03.944 --> 14:06.346
Ugh, finally, you get to me.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.748
Yeah, yeah, what's your
unfinished business?

14:08.781 --> 14:12.886
Revenge, against the man
who caused my death.

14:12.920 --> 14:16.256
(singsongy):
Hey, T-shirt, T-shirt, T-shirt!

14:16.289 --> 14:18.091
Fire!

14:18.791 --> 14:20.593
Ooh, a bobby pin!

14:20.627 --> 14:22.829
(screams)

14:22.862 --> 14:24.764
-(body thuds)
-(gasps)

14:24.797 --> 14:27.400
You mean the guy
who invented the T-shirt guns?

14:27.434 --> 14:29.769
-No.
-The guys who built the stadium

14:29.802 --> 14:32.505
-with a really low back wall?
-No.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.374
You, for standing up?

14:34.407 --> 14:37.610
No, your father,
your stupid, stupid father!

14:37.644 --> 14:40.880
You know, some people grow
when they die. Not you.

14:40.914 --> 14:43.116
See you, guys.

14:43.150 --> 14:46.419
That was fun, getting every
answer in Jeopardy! wrong.

14:46.453 --> 14:50.723
Hmm, all that saying good-bye
really made me thirsty.

14:50.757 --> 14:52.792
Mmm. Hmm?

14:52.825 --> 14:54.561
NELSON:
Maude Flanders says hello.

14:54.594 --> 14:57.064
Hello. (grunting)

15:01.501 --> 15:03.236
Let's move!

15:03.270 --> 15:07.540
Oh, thank you, Bart.
I'm finally at peace.

15:07.574 --> 15:08.942
You know, Ned remarried.

15:08.976 --> 15:11.644
He what?!

15:11.678 --> 15:14.414
(sighs) Well, that's it.
All the ghosts have been helped.

15:14.447 --> 15:15.815
Except one.

15:15.848 --> 15:17.951
Dad, you weren't
supposed to die.

15:17.985 --> 15:20.287
It was-it was just
supposed to scare you.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.388
Oh, don't worry.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.590
Patricide is just
a part of life.

15:23.623 --> 15:27.460
Ooh, your vocabulary
really goes up when you die.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.999
Dad, I am so sorry I killed you.

15:32.032 --> 15:33.967
It's cool.
I feel no pain.

15:34.001 --> 15:35.402
(shouts)

15:35.435 --> 15:37.604
Ooh, I was wrong.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.606
It feels worse than in life.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.641
Get away, you stupid cat!

15:41.674 --> 15:43.910
-(grunts) D'oh!
-(cat yowls)

15:43.943 --> 15:45.912
Oh, I can't believe you're dead.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.847
But at least
I can still see you,

15:47.880 --> 15:50.617
while I help you
with your unfinished business.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.519
Well, I wanted
to lose some weight,

15:52.552 --> 15:54.954
but I'm light as a feather now.

15:57.157 --> 16:01.094
All that's left is for me
to go into the light.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.096
(heavenly choir singing)

16:03.130 --> 16:04.831
You know how much
you hate walking.

16:04.864 --> 16:05.999
Stay with me.

16:06.033 --> 16:08.801
Stay with me, Bart.
Stay with me.

16:10.137 --> 16:12.639
Oh, Homie.
It's not your fault.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.641
You were doomed when
they started putting cheese

16:14.674 --> 16:16.343
into pizza crust.

16:16.376 --> 16:19.812
What's next, plugging
Swiss cheese with cookie dough?

16:19.846 --> 16:22.182
Peanut butter and hot dogs?

16:22.215 --> 16:24.617
Why isn't anyone
writing these things down?

16:24.651 --> 16:27.354
(crying)

16:27.387 --> 16:31.091
I can't watch this.
I'm gonna go check in on Moe's.

16:33.526 --> 16:36.063
I don't know what's wrong.
I served them lager.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.230
Uh-oh.

16:37.264 --> 16:38.465
I should go, son.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.400
I leave this world
without a care,

16:40.433 --> 16:42.402
knowing I raised two great kids,

16:42.435 --> 16:45.338
plus the one who murdered me.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.707
(monitor beeps rapidly,
flatlines)

16:47.740 --> 16:50.243
No, Bart,
you have to stay with me!

16:50.277 --> 16:52.011
(heavenly choir singing)

16:52.045 --> 16:54.347
No, Dad,
you have to stay with me!

16:54.381 --> 16:56.183
No, my time has come.

16:56.216 --> 16:59.552
Man was not meant to live
beyond the age of 39.

16:59.586 --> 17:00.753
You have to stay.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.755
If you leave,
Mom will marry someone else.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.157
I want her to be happy.

17:04.191 --> 17:06.093
And someone else
will raise your kids!

17:06.126 --> 17:07.660
(laughs)
Sucker.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.097
And someone else
will ride your mower.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.099
That bastard!

17:12.132 --> 17:15.135
Still, it's time
for me to move on.

17:18.071 --> 17:21.541
Oh, my God.
It's so beautiful!

17:21.574 --> 17:22.775
(Bart gasping)

17:27.547 --> 17:29.015
(glass shatters)

17:29.048 --> 17:30.983
(screaming)

17:32.719 --> 17:34.287
(laughs):
Dad!

17:34.321 --> 17:37.257
Why you little life-saving,

17:37.290 --> 17:39.259
heaven can waiting...!

17:39.292 --> 17:43.096
Bart, I'm so sorry
if I was ever mean to you,

17:43.130 --> 17:47.434
because even though
you started it, you...

17:47.467 --> 17:50.270
Sorry, sorry, I'm past that.

17:50.303 --> 17:52.705
(crying)

17:52.739 --> 17:54.441
I love you,

17:54.474 --> 17:57.810
and I want you back,
Bart Simpson.

17:59.312 --> 18:01.714
BART (weakly):
Lisa?

18:01.748 --> 18:03.783
Ah! He's awake!

18:03.816 --> 18:06.286
-Thank God.
-Lisa?

18:06.319 --> 18:09.822
Have you been by my side
this whole time?

18:09.856 --> 18:11.424
I have.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.926
Were you putting
those bad dreams in my head?

18:13.960 --> 18:15.262
Yes.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.397
-Can you teach me how to do it?
-I guess.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.299
And can you help me
put Dad in a coma?

18:19.332 --> 18:20.633
No.

18:20.667 --> 18:23.136
(chewing, moaning)

18:23.170 --> 18:24.971
Oh, man, this is great.

18:25.004 --> 18:27.440
But how do I know
this isn't a dream, too?

18:27.474 --> 18:29.642
Because you're not
wearing the sweater.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.911
Oh, yeah, of course.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.846
Wait a minute.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.249
How did he know
about the sweater?

18:36.283 --> 18:38.651
(dramatic music playing)

18:43.055 --> 18:45.325
Bart, did you see anything else
when you were under?

18:45.358 --> 18:46.859
Just how we're all gonna die.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.861
-Want me to tell you?
-Not really.

18:48.895 --> 18:50.497
Well, I'm gonna tell you anyway.

18:50.530 --> 18:51.931
* Ouch *

18:51.964 --> 18:56.035
* I have lost myself again *

18:58.538 --> 19:03.310
* Lost myself
and I am nowhere... *

19:03.343 --> 19:06.379
I knew it was a sandwich.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.315
* Yeah... *

19:08.348 --> 19:10.350
(coughing)

19:10.383 --> 19:11.384
(groans)

19:13.920 --> 19:17.990
* Lost myself again *

19:18.024 --> 19:22.562
* And I feel unsafe *

19:22.595 --> 19:25.265
* Be my friend *

19:28.668 --> 19:31.638
* Hold me *

19:31.671 --> 19:34.507
* Wrap me up *

19:36.509 --> 19:38.010
* Unfold me *

19:38.044 --> 19:40.012
(laughs)

19:40.046 --> 19:44.551
* I am small *

19:44.584 --> 19:46.319
* I'm needy... *

19:46.353 --> 19:48.087
Oh, my God!

19:48.120 --> 19:52.492
Now I realize, this has
all been a waste of time.

19:52.525 --> 19:55.495
* And breathe me *

19:55.528 --> 19:57.063
* Be my friend *

20:00.933 --> 20:04.337
* Hold me, wrap me up *

20:04.371 --> 20:06.473
Now I'm the evil king.

20:08.074 --> 20:11.244
* Unfold me *

20:11.278 --> 20:16.215
* I am small *

20:16.249 --> 20:18.951
* I'm needy *

20:18.985 --> 20:22.955
* Warm me up *

20:25.224 --> 20:29.128
* And breathe *

20:29.161 --> 20:31.163
* Me. *

21:04.096 --> 21:05.532
Shh!

21:09.001 --> 21:10.937
