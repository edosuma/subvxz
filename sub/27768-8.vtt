01:30.840 --> 01:33.240
It's just a preliminary draft.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.000
Olivia!

03:00.600 --> 03:02.320
Olivia!

03:03.560 --> 03:05.519
Olivia!

03:05.520 --> 03:07.239
How was London?

03:07.240 --> 03:09.439
You're leaving. Now.

03:09.440 --> 03:11.199
What? Come on!

03:11.200 --> 03:13.439
No! You know I can't.

03:13.440 --> 03:16.319
Come along. Father!
Chop chop.

03:16.320 --> 03:19.359
Should've done this years ago.
I can't!

03:19.360 --> 03:20.999
Please!

03:21.000 --> 03:23.159
Someone's got to put a stop
to this nonsense.

03:23.160 --> 03:25.799
People are saying that you're mad,
Olivia. Let go!

03:25.800 --> 03:28.200
Stop it! A crackpot.
A raving lunatic!

03:29.240 --> 03:31.079
Get outside!

03:31.080 --> 03:32.239
Edward!

03:32.240 --> 03:35.359
Pull yourself together!
Stop being so bloody weak.

03:35.360 --> 03:38.239
Stop, stop, stop.
Take your hands off her.

03:38.240 --> 03:40.200
Or what?

03:44.880 --> 03:46.159
Stop.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.800
I... I...

03:49.640 --> 03:52.879
I want you gone.

03:52.880 --> 03:55.199
All of you.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.720
Gone!

04:29.760 --> 04:31.999
Key's in. Can't see a damn thing.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.839
Well, I-I could, y'know,
break the door down.

04:34.840 --> 04:36.880
It's 200 years old!

04:46.560 --> 04:48.040
Excuse me.

05:17.520 --> 05:19.200
Call the police!

05:58.040 --> 06:01.079
Right, this is our coroner,
Jane Kennedy.

06:01.080 --> 06:03.679
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Thank you.

06:03.680 --> 06:05.119
Olivia.

06:05.120 --> 06:07.679
My brother, Edward.

06:07.680 --> 06:09.639
His daughter, Lily.

06:09.640 --> 06:11.199
Hi, Lily.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.720
She's in shock. We all are.

06:16.480 --> 06:19.279
Sorry, you are...?
Er, Terence. Terence Brooks.

06:19.280 --> 06:22.039
A writer. A very good one, too.

06:22.040 --> 06:25.279
Writing a book
on the Sidwell history.

06:25.280 --> 06:28.399
I don't know the protocol for this.
Should I offer you a drink?

06:28.400 --> 06:30.119
No, no, we're fine. Thank you.

06:30.120 --> 06:32.879
We were having dinner
when it happened. Together.

06:32.880 --> 06:35.439
The four of us.

06:35.440 --> 06:37.039
Is anything missing?

06:37.040 --> 06:40.359
Robbery? We haven't looked. We
thought we shouldn't touch anything.

06:40.360 --> 06:42.759
No, that's right.
CSI are still doing their thing,

06:42.760 --> 06:44.679
and we don't want to
disturb a crime scene.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.719
Have we met before?

06:46.720 --> 06:48.839
No. No, no. I don't think so.

06:48.840 --> 06:52.160
You look very familiar.
Can't place you.

06:53.560 --> 06:55.360
Did you used to sweep our chimneys?

06:57.680 --> 07:01.800
I'll, erm... I'll show you
where he is. Excuse me.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.599
I can't believe
he doesn't remember me.

07:11.600 --> 07:15.119
50 quid, my dad paid.
50 quid for a broken window.

07:15.120 --> 07:18.279
And I had to pay it back.
A pound a week from my paper round.

07:18.280 --> 07:21.159
It took me months. You did
break into their summerhouse.

07:21.160 --> 07:23.519
Lucky they didn't catch you,
then, wasn't it?

07:23.520 --> 07:26.439
You'd have been harder to forget,
seeing as you were in the buff.

07:26.440 --> 07:27.959
Stop it!

07:27.960 --> 07:31.319
I can still see you now. How long
were you trapped in there again?

07:31.320 --> 07:32.959
Shall we examine the body?

07:32.960 --> 07:34.480
Changing the subject...!

07:42.800 --> 07:45.039
Single stab wound.

07:45.040 --> 07:47.799
Looks like it's to the heart.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.879
He's got defensive marks
on his hand.

07:49.880 --> 07:52.000
The chair was stabbed four times.

07:52.960 --> 07:55.359
Must've put up a bit of a fight.

07:55.360 --> 07:59.319
Record player drowned out the noise?
Why so many stabs?

07:59.320 --> 08:01.519
Well, maybe he hid behind it.

08:01.520 --> 08:04.079
Looks like murder,
so it's one of yours.

08:04.080 --> 08:05.759
Don't you think it's weird,

08:05.760 --> 08:08.759
them all living together?
It's like they've never grown up.

08:08.760 --> 08:10.879
What adult still lives
with their parents?

08:10.880 --> 08:12.879
People who don't have a choice.

08:12.880 --> 08:15.079
Yeah. Have your guys
found the murder weapon?

08:15.080 --> 08:18.039
No. Door was locked from
the inside, window was wide open.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.959
No fingerprints.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.999
I didn't mean you.
OK, well, let's move the body.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
We'll get a forensic PM.
Righto.

08:28.920 --> 08:31.239
You must know the Sidwells.

08:31.240 --> 08:33.318
I thought you went to
one of their open gardens.

08:33.320 --> 08:36.958
Er, no, no. First time there
yesterday. Definitely.

08:36.960 --> 08:40.479
Donald was a nasty old git. Figured
just cos he had a fancy house

08:40.480 --> 08:43.719
and a village named after him,
he was better than everyone else.

08:43.720 --> 08:45.639
Dead touchy, too.

08:45.640 --> 08:49.799
He kicked off in Dot Saunders'
pharmacy a few months ago.

08:49.800 --> 08:54.519
Knocked over a display and accused
everyone of laughing at him.

08:54.520 --> 08:56.119
They're all a bit, y'know...

08:56.120 --> 08:57.759
Inbred.

08:57.760 --> 09:00.319
And then there's the sister. Olive.

09:00.320 --> 09:03.799
Olivia. Vampire.
So Ron the milk says.

09:03.800 --> 09:06.199
She always makes him
bring the milk inside.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.039
Hasn't left the hall in years.

09:08.040 --> 09:11.159
Doesn't make her a vampire.
Ron don't take any chances, though.

09:11.160 --> 09:14.719
Always wears a crucifix and eats
a bulb of garlic before he delivers.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.879
I thought he was French for years.

09:16.880 --> 09:20.119
It's the granddaughter I feel
sorry for, living with that lot.

09:20.120 --> 09:22.599
They took her out of her posh
boarding school last year,

09:22.600 --> 09:24.719
put her in the local comp. Why?

09:24.720 --> 09:27.199
I dunno. Maybe she was expelled.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.919
Bingo Paula said
she's always on her tod

09:29.920 --> 09:31.879
and doesn't want to make friends.

09:31.880 --> 09:33.759
And then there's her dad.

09:33.760 --> 09:36.119
He strangled his missus.

09:36.120 --> 09:38.999
Hid the body. Never been found.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.120
Then how do you know
she was strangled?

09:47.240 --> 09:49.199
She drowned. Allegedly.

09:49.200 --> 09:52.359
Poor Lily. Yeah, I looked it up
this morning, funny enough.

09:52.360 --> 09:55.479
I was stationed in Penzance at the
time she'd been reported missing.

09:55.480 --> 09:59.919
They found her boat washed up
at Gorra Point, smashed to pieces.

09:59.920 --> 10:01.999
Never found her body.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.999
Did anyone suspect Edward
of being involved?

10:04.000 --> 10:07.479
Yeah, everyone did. He wasn't
very co-operative, actually.

10:07.480 --> 10:10.399
It was Olivia that phoned the
police. But he was investigated.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.199
Yeah, but his dad had influence.

10:12.200 --> 10:15.479
Once they found the boat,
it was an open verdict.

10:15.480 --> 10:17.599
Convenient, though, isn't it?

10:17.600 --> 10:21.039
His wife dies mysteriously,
and now his father, too.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.279
Meaning?

10:22.280 --> 10:23.799
He was a bit antsy last night.

10:23.800 --> 10:28.839
His father had just been murdered!
Acting suspicious, if you ask me.

10:28.840 --> 10:31.799
Oh, bad news about
the forensic postmortem.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.919
Geoff Reid's our pathologist,
so don't expect anything quick.

10:34.920 --> 10:37.599
Or expect him to do anything but
state the blindingly obvious.

10:37.600 --> 10:41.879
Can't we ask for a new one? They're
all busy. Geoff's all we've got.

10:41.880 --> 10:43.759
Listen...

10:43.760 --> 10:47.079
About the summerhouse.
You never told anyone, did you?

10:47.080 --> 10:49.079
"Don't tell my mum, Davey!
Don't tell my mum!"

10:49.080 --> 10:51.759
I did not sound like that.

10:51.760 --> 10:53.639
Did you?

10:53.640 --> 10:55.360
What do you think?

10:58.920 --> 11:00.439
You forgot something?

11:00.440 --> 11:01.960
Court!

11:05.000 --> 11:08.399
Olivia served supper at 7:30.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.439
And your father wasn't
eating with you?

11:10.440 --> 11:14.679
He'd eaten earlier. Been at his club
in London for the day.

11:14.680 --> 11:17.719
We'd started pudding
when we heard the record jumping

11:17.720 --> 11:21.480
just before eight. Thought it
strange Father didn't stop it.

11:23.640 --> 11:26.679
Oh, and there is something
that's been stolen.

11:26.680 --> 11:29.399
Napoleon's violin.

11:29.400 --> 11:33.359
THE Napoleon?
It was a gift to Sir George Sidwell.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.239
He was one of Napoleon's
jailers on St Helena.

11:36.240 --> 11:39.519
Napoleon said he was the only
Englishman he'd shake hands with.

11:39.520 --> 11:41.879
Gave it to him
as a token of their friendship.

11:41.880 --> 11:44.600
And it's definitely missing?
We just said so, didn't we?

11:46.680 --> 11:49.919
Was your father meeting anyone
at his club?

11:49.920 --> 11:52.359
I don't know.
He kept his business to himself.

11:52.360 --> 11:55.560
Really? You've got absolutely
no idea? I'm not his secretary!

11:56.760 --> 11:58.800
Did he keep a diary, do you know?

12:00.760 --> 12:02.440
Would that be it over there?

12:04.760 --> 12:08.040
Those were his personal papers.
I don't think he'd mind.

12:09.320 --> 12:13.120
Why aren't you out there,
looking for whoever did this?

12:14.520 --> 12:16.600
Who's Herriot?

12:32.800 --> 12:36.399
Yeah? Here's that report
for Donald Sidwell. Oh, right, OK.

12:36.400 --> 12:38.240
Thanks, Jim.

12:46.960 --> 12:48.320
Bloody hell!

12:59.800 --> 13:01.839
Guess how much
Napoleon's violin is worth.

13:01.840 --> 13:05.039
70p. Hello? It's Napoleon's!
It'd be, like, two grand.

13:05.040 --> 13:07.679
3.6 million.

13:07.680 --> 13:10.599
What was it made out of? Gold?

13:10.600 --> 13:14.279
And the preliminary CSI report's in.
Like I said, no fingerprints.

13:14.280 --> 13:16.639
No clear footprints in the beds
outside the window.

13:16.640 --> 13:20.319
Family claim they were all together
when it happened. We've got nothing.

13:20.320 --> 13:23.559
Apart from the violin
and that Donald met a man in London.

13:23.560 --> 13:26.519
Herriot. Who's he?
Could he have followed him back?

13:26.520 --> 13:29.759
To Devon? I doubt it.
I've put a call in, left a message.

13:29.760 --> 13:33.479
Clint's been on the phone
to the solicitors.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.959
Clint? Solicitors?

13:34.960 --> 13:37.959
Sorry. The main beneficiary
is Edward, his son.

13:37.960 --> 13:40.959
Inherits everything. Everything?
There's this entailment thingy.

13:40.960 --> 13:43.799
All assets go to the male heir.
That's interesting.

13:43.800 --> 13:45.679
I'm waiting on
the financial records.

13:45.680 --> 13:47.799
You got the medical ones?

13:47.800 --> 13:50.319
He had a private doctor.
All requests need to be in writing.

13:50.320 --> 13:53.319
Bank are the same with his financial
ones. It's like he's the Queen.

13:53.320 --> 13:56.720
Whoa, hey, hey, I haven't finished.
Well, you'll have to come with me.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.120
Where?

14:03.920 --> 14:07.720
So you're moving out of your mum's?
Mm. Can't stay there for ever.

14:08.680 --> 14:12.319
I'm telling you, it's Edward.
He's got a motive.

14:12.320 --> 14:15.639
The will.
So why's the violin missing?

14:15.640 --> 14:19.399
He could've sold it,
argued with Donald about it.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.359
Are you sure this isn't about the
summerhouse? It was a long time ago.

14:22.360 --> 14:23.840
No! No, I'm not that petty.

14:25.520 --> 14:28.639
Or maybe I am. It's just
their stories are straight.

14:28.640 --> 14:32.239
They're too straight.
They're hiding something.

14:32.240 --> 14:34.199
I need your help.

14:34.200 --> 14:36.439
You're asking me for help?
Are you feeling all right?

14:36.440 --> 14:37.879
I want you to talk to them.

14:37.880 --> 14:41.079
They might slip up if they're not
talking to the police.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.119
What do you say?

14:43.120 --> 14:44.519
Well?

14:44.520 --> 14:45.800
Now, that's more like it.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.680
Is that a yes or a no?

14:55.880 --> 14:57.559
He was a...

14:57.560 --> 14:59.400
strong character.

15:02.440 --> 15:04.959
Shall we talk in the garden?
It's a lovely day.

15:04.960 --> 15:06.759
I'd rather not.

15:06.760 --> 15:08.760
We could sit in the shade.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.199
Olivia?

15:15.200 --> 15:16.519
No, I can't.

15:16.520 --> 15:19.120
I can't go outside. I...

15:21.840 --> 15:23.080
I'm agoraphobic.

15:24.960 --> 15:28.199
Ah. It's diagnosed. It's not
something I have any control over.

15:28.200 --> 15:31.519
No. I can't just pull myself
together. Of course not.

15:31.520 --> 15:33.560
Who said you could?

15:34.760 --> 15:36.360
Your father?

15:37.680 --> 15:39.200
No.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.040
Well, he didn't really
understand it.

15:46.880 --> 15:49.879
Well, I don't think
I'll be much help, because

15:49.880 --> 15:51.839
I've only known them two months.

15:51.840 --> 15:54.239
I was just wondering
how you got the job here.

15:54.240 --> 15:56.279
Can't imagine it was
advertised in a Jobcentre.

15:56.280 --> 15:59.519
No, there was an advert
in Literature Today.

15:59.520 --> 16:02.999
It's not paid,
just board and lodgings.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.199
Olivia liked an article I'd written
on Napoleon's last years, so...

16:07.200 --> 16:10.079
Didn't matter it wasn't paid? No.

16:10.080 --> 16:12.679
It's fascinating subject matter,
isn't it?

16:12.680 --> 16:15.479
Half the royalties, no overheads.

16:15.480 --> 16:17.959
How did you find Donald?

16:17.960 --> 16:20.599
Olivia said he was difficult...

16:20.600 --> 16:24.359
telling her to pull herself
together. It wasn't her fault.

16:24.360 --> 16:26.119
Well...

16:26.120 --> 16:27.479
He had a...

16:27.480 --> 16:29.240
malicious streak.

16:30.600 --> 16:35.239
You understand, a woman like Olivia,
you know, she...

16:35.240 --> 16:37.639
she really needs looking after.

16:37.640 --> 16:39.479
Who by?

16:39.480 --> 16:40.919
You?

16:40.920 --> 16:43.479
Hm? No, no. No.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.200
Of course not.

16:53.600 --> 16:56.560
Hi, Lily. We met last night.
I'm Jane.

16:57.680 --> 16:59.360
Can I come in?

17:06.720 --> 17:08.799
I'm very sorry
about your grandfather.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.440
I'm not. Couldn't stand him.

17:11.880 --> 17:15.398
Sorry. I know you're not meant
to say stuff like that.

17:15.400 --> 17:18.919
It's fine. Just makes me think
you're being honest.

17:18.920 --> 17:21.279
Most people lie.

17:21.280 --> 17:22.598
Why didn't you like him?

17:22.599 --> 17:26.999
He didn't like children.
Don't think he liked anyone.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.560
Sounds like fun

17:34.560 --> 17:36.920
Who's that? Is that your mum?

17:38.480 --> 17:39.999
Wow.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.839
She's very beautiful.

17:41.840 --> 17:44.359
She died when I was four.

17:44.360 --> 17:46.399
I was 14 when my dad died.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.640
What happened?

17:48.920 --> 17:52.319
He was a trawlerman. He drowned.

17:52.320 --> 17:53.399
I didn't mean...

17:53.400 --> 17:55.959
No, it's fine.
It was a long time ago.

17:55.960 --> 17:58.199
I try to remember the happy times.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.279
I can hardly remember her.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.839
Just...

18:01.840 --> 18:04.280
she was funny. Made me laugh.

18:07.160 --> 18:10.839
Sorry. Keep meaning to tidy up.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.199
I eat up here.

18:12.200 --> 18:13.719
Hate being down there.

18:13.720 --> 18:16.319
My daughter would, too, if I let her.

18:16.320 --> 18:17.439
All your meals?

18:17.440 --> 18:20.199
Yeah. They're always
so formal downstairs.

18:20.200 --> 18:23.159
And last night? Yeah, I...

18:23.160 --> 18:25.640
I mean no. I...

18:27.520 --> 18:29.039
If they lied about being together,

18:29.040 --> 18:31.559
they could've lied about
everything else.

18:31.560 --> 18:34.239
It's Edward.
Don't jump to conclusions.

18:34.240 --> 18:36.919
Could've been the sister.
She can't go outside.

18:36.920 --> 18:39.119
I'm going to check with
her doctor about that.

18:39.120 --> 18:43.519
Don't know why Terence lied, though.
Because he's in love with Olivia.

18:43.520 --> 18:45.119
How do you know?

18:45.120 --> 18:46.319
It's obvious.

18:46.320 --> 18:48.680
Is it? It's all in the subtext.

18:51.800 --> 18:54.199
CSI have drawn a blank,

18:54.200 --> 18:56.599
come up with nothing
apart from some air-rifle pellets

18:56.600 --> 18:59.599
and a few broken bottles.
Lily's? Likes shooting.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.359
Shooting? Bit violent.

19:01.360 --> 19:02.959
Only if you're a champagne bottle.

19:02.960 --> 19:06.519
There's no CCTV.
Nearest camera's a mile away.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.199
Did Donald's club call back?

19:08.200 --> 19:10.279
No. I'm going to chase them
about that.

19:10.280 --> 19:13.959
I'm kind of concentrating closer to
home, though. It's an inside job.

19:13.960 --> 19:16.199
Someone must have known
about the violin.

19:16.200 --> 19:19.440
Clint, why don't you keep calling
till they answer?

19:21.240 --> 19:24.439
I'll split 'em up tomorrow,
rattle them.

19:24.440 --> 19:26.479
Starting with Edward.

19:26.480 --> 19:28.240
Do you want a chip? Mm. Ohhh!

19:33.120 --> 19:35.200
Jane Kennedy.

19:36.160 --> 19:38.960
Yes. It's about Bay View Cottage.

20:33.040 --> 20:35.959
I'm just asking you politely
to accompany me to the station.

20:35.960 --> 20:39.319
Demanding I go with you?
You can't think I'm a suspect.

20:39.320 --> 20:41.199
Even you can't be that dim!

20:41.200 --> 20:43.999
Well, you all lied about being
together when your father died.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.039
Just makes me wonder
what else you lied about.

20:46.040 --> 20:48.639
Officers investigating your wife's
disappearance said you

20:48.640 --> 20:49.959
were uncooperative, as well.

20:49.960 --> 20:52.319
So you can either come
with me now voluntarily,

20:52.320 --> 20:53.639
or I'm going to arrest you

20:53.640 --> 20:56.319
for attempting to pervert
the course of justice.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.200
The choice, my friend, is yours.

21:00.200 --> 21:03.240
Fine. Have it your way.

21:10.680 --> 21:12.400
Why did he bring Mum up?

21:13.520 --> 21:16.000
Does he think Dad killed her?

21:17.600 --> 21:18.639
What?

21:18.640 --> 21:20.959
No! Of course not. Don't be...

21:20.960 --> 21:22.600
Well, he must do. Why mention it?

21:23.640 --> 21:26.559
It'd make sense.
He never talks about her.

21:26.560 --> 21:28.079
Refuses.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.840
Lily, please. Every time I try,
he cuts me off.

21:33.600 --> 21:35.919
Did he murder her?

21:35.920 --> 21:39.079
Lily, no, stop this.
Your aunt has been through enough!

21:39.080 --> 21:41.359
You would take her side.

21:41.360 --> 21:43.440
Seeing as you're sleeping with her!

21:47.120 --> 21:49.880
Lily! I'm so sorry.

21:55.200 --> 21:58.759
So why did you all lie to me?
Wanted to make it simple for you.

21:58.760 --> 22:01.279
You need all the help you can get.
You should be thanking me.

22:01.280 --> 22:02.639
I should be charging you!

22:02.640 --> 22:04.439
So where were you?

22:04.440 --> 22:06.039
In the library.

22:06.040 --> 22:07.879
And the others?

22:07.880 --> 22:11.879
Lily and Terence were in
their rooms. Olivia was upstairs.

22:11.880 --> 22:13.399
She hasn't left the house in years.

22:13.400 --> 22:16.439
That's right. Doctor says she hasn't
been out the house in... ten years?

22:16.440 --> 22:18.359
12. After my wife... When she...

22:18.360 --> 22:19.879
Oh, your wife, yeah.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.599
Convenient, that.
They never found her body.

22:22.600 --> 22:25.199
Can't do a postmortem
without one, can you?

22:25.200 --> 22:27.840
Or did you lie about that, as well?

22:30.920 --> 22:32.320
I want my solicitor.

22:34.560 --> 22:35.879
His number.

22:35.880 --> 22:38.759
You write it down. You can write?

22:38.760 --> 22:40.399
Yeah, I can.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.320
It's just I'm not your secretary.

22:50.040 --> 22:51.840
One too many last night, was it?

22:52.880 --> 22:55.320
It's early-onset Parkinson's.

22:58.920 --> 23:01.000
All right. All right.

23:06.600 --> 23:08.520
What's the name of your doctor?

23:14.920 --> 23:17.639
I'm going to need new statements
and fingerprints from you all.

23:17.640 --> 23:19.639
Fingerprints? What, er... What for?

23:19.640 --> 23:22.640
Elimination. We'll use the library.

23:33.240 --> 23:34.799
Oh! Oh, no.

23:34.800 --> 23:36.519
I thought you were working late.

23:36.520 --> 23:37.799
Yeah. I changed my mind.

23:37.800 --> 23:41.719
Erm, did you have a good day
at work, love? Beth's out.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.559
We're having film night.

23:43.560 --> 23:46.759
Nine And A Half Weeks. She's
Mickey Rourke, I'm Kim Basinger.

23:46.760 --> 23:49.799
What, in here? Well, we've got to be
near the fridge, ain't we?

23:49.800 --> 23:52.319
Come on, give us a hug
before it gets messy.

23:52.320 --> 23:53.599
Oh, please!

23:53.600 --> 23:56.280
C'mere, lover.

24:04.600 --> 24:07.039
Olivia! Please!
How could you be so stupid?

24:07.040 --> 24:10.199
I didn't tell you
because I didn't want to hurt you.

24:10.200 --> 24:12.079
I did it for us.

24:12.080 --> 24:13.239
Us?

24:13.240 --> 24:15.439
There is no us.

24:15.440 --> 24:17.879
You were just convenient.

24:17.880 --> 24:19.679
You've ruined everything!

24:19.680 --> 24:21.280
What's happened?

24:27.800 --> 24:29.040
We have a problem.

24:36.240 --> 24:39.559
Donald's club said what? 'He was only
there 20 minutes. Seemed agitated.'

24:39.560 --> 24:43.279
There's no members called Herriot.
'Strange.'

24:43.280 --> 24:46.719
His doctor diagnosed him
with anxiety and depression.

24:46.720 --> 24:48.199
Was he on antidepressants?

24:48.200 --> 24:49.599
Yeah. It's all in the report.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.359
Yeah, I know that,
but I can't read it.

24:51.360 --> 24:52.519
'Yes, for 18 months.'

24:52.520 --> 24:53.959
What? Can't hear you.

24:53.960 --> 24:57.279
Yes! For 18 months!

24:57.280 --> 24:59.840
OK. Thanks, Clint.

25:03.160 --> 25:06.039
Have I told you
that I love you yet this evening?

25:06.040 --> 25:09.639
Three times. The second time,
you knocked my coffee over.

25:09.640 --> 25:13.159
It's lovely to be here all together.

25:13.160 --> 25:16.719
One big, happy family!

25:16.720 --> 25:20.199
Mum, I'm trying to work. Ooh. Right.

25:20.200 --> 25:21.599
Yeah.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.760
Ooh, sorry.

25:26.440 --> 25:27.800
I love you.

25:35.520 --> 25:37.160
Finally!

25:49.720 --> 25:51.239
Geoff Reid just called.

25:51.240 --> 25:54.320
He's finally going to do
the postmortem this morning.

25:55.400 --> 25:58.199
Did you know Donald was depressed?

25:58.200 --> 25:59.439
Are you listening?

25:59.440 --> 26:02.319
I just ran Terence Brooks's
fingerprints through the database.

26:02.320 --> 26:04.199
And guess what. Surprise me.

26:04.200 --> 26:07.839
He's got a criminal record. Did
18 months in Strangeways for fraud.

26:07.840 --> 26:09.079
He's a writer.

26:09.080 --> 26:12.199
Cover story. He hears about
the violin. Sees an advert.

26:12.200 --> 26:13.599
Goes there to steal it.

26:13.600 --> 26:16.159
Well, why kill Donald? Why not
just steal it? And why now?

26:16.160 --> 26:18.839
Well, obviously there's a few gaps.

26:18.840 --> 26:21.040
I'll just ask him to fill them in.

26:37.240 --> 26:39.359
I'm here for Terence.

26:39.360 --> 26:40.599
He's gone.

26:40.600 --> 26:41.799
Where?

26:41.800 --> 26:46.199
No idea. Got up this morning
and he'd vanished.

26:46.200 --> 26:47.800
Mind if I come in?

26:50.120 --> 26:51.319
'Fraud?'

26:51.320 --> 26:53.359
I can't believe it.

26:53.360 --> 26:56.759
We trusted him. Treated him
like a member of the family.

26:56.760 --> 26:58.279
To steal from us...

26:58.280 --> 27:00.039
murder Father.

27:00.040 --> 27:04.119
They argued, you know,
the night Father died.

27:04.120 --> 27:06.839
Father tried to drag me outside.
Terence stopped him.

27:06.840 --> 27:09.919
Thought Terence was going to
punch him!

27:09.920 --> 27:12.879
Something else
you forgot to mention?

27:12.880 --> 27:14.159
Odd, though.

27:14.160 --> 27:16.199
Well, he had a thing for me.

27:16.200 --> 27:17.919
No, I knew that.

27:17.920 --> 27:20.120
I meant your father
dragging you outside.

27:22.680 --> 27:25.559
No sign of Terence.
He's like the Invisible Man.

27:25.560 --> 27:28.839
Still, we know his motive.
And he was defending Olivia.

27:28.840 --> 27:30.319
So it wasn't Edward?

27:30.320 --> 27:32.359
Well, they could've been
in on it together.

27:32.360 --> 27:35.359
Checked with his doctor. He wasn't
entirely sure he could have done it.

27:35.360 --> 27:37.319
And I got Donald's
financial records.

27:37.320 --> 27:40.119
I'm just waiting on the insurance.
But he was broke.

27:40.120 --> 27:42.999
What? Sidwell Hall must be
worth a fortune!

27:43.000 --> 27:45.719
No. He's been remortgaging that
for the last ten years.

27:45.720 --> 27:49.959
It's in negative equity. The only
thing of any value was the violin.

27:49.960 --> 27:52.159
Actually, I've just
had MY mortgage approved.

27:52.160 --> 27:54.559
Oh, right!
So you're finally moving out?

27:54.560 --> 27:57.079
Well, they've accepted my offer
on Bay View House.

27:57.080 --> 27:58.239
Don't tell my mum.

27:58.240 --> 28:00.359
"Don't tell my mum, Davey!
Don't tell my mum!"

28:00.360 --> 28:01.599
Stop it!

28:01.600 --> 28:03.799
No, you're all right,
I can keep a secret.

28:03.800 --> 28:06.800
I never told anyone
about the summerhouse.

28:09.080 --> 28:13.399
I've been doing some research.
After you said you thought it was

28:13.400 --> 28:17.199
strange there was no Herriot
at Donald's club, I called every

28:17.200 --> 28:18.719
Herriot in London. Dead end.

28:18.720 --> 28:22.439
All of them? Yeah.
So I researched violins.

28:22.440 --> 28:26.479
Buyers, dealers, auctions, etc, etc.

28:26.480 --> 28:29.399
I found some closed sites, sites
that don't come up in a search?

28:29.400 --> 28:32.359
Right. Is this going anywhere?
Obviously! And bingo.

28:32.360 --> 28:35.519
That's where I came to this,
an article about offline

28:35.520 --> 28:40.439
antique dealers specialising
in rare string instruments.

28:40.440 --> 28:42.439
Herriots! What did they say?

28:42.440 --> 28:45.279
Nothing yet. The owner's on a flight
from Dubai. Back in four hours.

28:45.280 --> 28:47.679
Great. Talk to him
the minute he lands.

28:47.680 --> 28:50.719
I would, but I've got
some rellies at the morgue. Shame.

28:50.720 --> 28:53.199
No, I'll look after them.
I can ask Geoff for the PM.

28:53.200 --> 28:55.440
Watch out for the...
Yes, thank you.

29:08.320 --> 29:10.719
Why did they mention Mum?

29:10.720 --> 29:13.439
I thought you were avoiding me.

29:13.440 --> 29:15.319
Did you kill her?

29:15.320 --> 29:16.520
Mummy?

29:17.640 --> 29:18.840
Well, did you?

29:22.280 --> 29:24.520
Edward, she should know the truth.

29:25.480 --> 29:27.680
We can't keep hiding it from her.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.840
Your father didn't do anything.

29:35.520 --> 29:36.919
She had an affair.

29:36.920 --> 29:38.959
With the gardener.

29:38.960 --> 29:40.959
Adam.

29:40.960 --> 29:42.879
She...

29:42.880 --> 29:44.719
They...

29:44.720 --> 29:49.400
ran away together. Abroad somewhere.
Somewhere we wouldn't find them.

29:50.600 --> 29:52.519
She's alive?

29:52.520 --> 29:54.199
Why didn't you tell me?

29:54.200 --> 29:57.159
Your grandfather didn't want
the scandal.

29:57.160 --> 29:59.719
Worried it would harm
our reputation.

29:59.720 --> 30:01.119
You know your grandfather.

30:01.120 --> 30:03.599
Who cares about our reputation?

30:03.600 --> 30:06.599
How dare you let me think
she was dead! How dare you!

30:06.600 --> 30:08.599
I thought she was dead!
You let me!

30:08.600 --> 30:11.559
It's not your father you should be
angry with, it's her.

30:11.560 --> 30:14.079
Because she left this hellhole?

30:14.080 --> 30:15.680
Because she left you.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.159
He wouldn't let her take me. He...

30:20.160 --> 30:21.439
She didn't want you.

30:21.440 --> 30:23.439
Please, Olivia. That's not true.

30:23.440 --> 30:25.479
He asked her.

30:25.480 --> 30:29.079
You were four years old.
You needed your mother.

30:29.080 --> 30:31.839
But she wanted to be alone...

30:31.840 --> 30:33.160
just the two of them.

30:34.720 --> 30:37.759
Father was worried about the shame.

30:37.760 --> 30:42.560
We were worried about you. That's
why we pretended she was dead.

30:44.840 --> 30:46.040
I'm sorry.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.400
I'm so, so sorry.

31:17.040 --> 31:20.359
Oi! That's my boat!

31:20.360 --> 31:21.520
Oi!

31:32.280 --> 31:35.760
Hello, Donald. I hope they've been
looking after you.

31:38.200 --> 31:40.720
So, let's see what Geoff had to say.

31:43.200 --> 31:47.039
You weren't taking
your antidepressants. No trace.

31:47.040 --> 31:48.560
I wonder why that was.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.560
Let's see.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.080
That's strange.

32:18.200 --> 32:19.439
Clint? Hi.

32:19.440 --> 32:22.039
Could you get hold of Davey
for me, please?

32:22.040 --> 32:23.720
Why did you go to Sidwell Hall?

32:25.280 --> 32:27.079
They needed a writer.

32:27.080 --> 32:29.999
Did they know you'd
been inside for fraud?

32:30.000 --> 32:31.759
Did you go there
to steal the violin?

32:31.760 --> 32:32.959
No.

32:32.960 --> 32:35.079
Just to kill Donald?

32:35.080 --> 32:37.639
Why did you kill him?
Because he hurt Olivia?

32:37.640 --> 32:39.560
Look, I...

32:41.000 --> 32:42.719
No comment.

32:42.720 --> 32:44.440
Did Edward ask you to do it?

32:45.960 --> 32:47.120
Did she?

32:48.240 --> 32:49.639
No comment.

32:49.640 --> 32:51.639
And why did you do a runner?

32:51.640 --> 32:54.999
Come on, Terence!
I can play this game all day.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.439
Why did you murder Donald Sidwell?

32:57.440 --> 32:58.600
No comment.

33:07.320 --> 33:09.279
What did he say? "No comment."

33:09.280 --> 33:12.119
You can tell me. No, that's what
he said to everything I asked.

33:12.120 --> 33:13.759
I don't think it was him.

33:13.760 --> 33:16.199
He didn't have the violin,
he didn't leave straightaway,

33:16.200 --> 33:18.359
and why steal from
someone you're in love with?

33:18.360 --> 33:20.719
Unless you're protecting someone.

33:20.720 --> 33:24.279
Edward? The forensic PM.
Geoff finally finished it.

33:24.280 --> 33:26.679
No conclusions, obviously, but look.

33:26.680 --> 33:28.719
Donald only had cuts
on his left hand.

33:28.720 --> 33:31.679
And they're only millimetres deep.
When were you going to tell me, eh?

33:31.680 --> 33:32.719
What?

33:32.720 --> 33:34.200
This!

33:36.040 --> 33:37.400
Beth found it in your room!

33:39.720 --> 33:42.840
Special offer on baked beans?
Oh! It's here somewhere.

33:47.600 --> 33:49.919
I thought you liked living with us.
What's the matter?

33:49.920 --> 33:51.719
Not fancy enough for you?

33:51.720 --> 33:54.199
No, Mum, it's not that.
What is it, then?

33:54.200 --> 33:55.839
I talked to Herriots.

33:55.840 --> 33:59.120
Look, Mum, I'm really sorry,
can we talk about this later?

34:00.800 --> 34:02.319
The violin's a fake.

34:02.320 --> 34:05.159
What? What? It's old.
Worth six or seven hundred,

34:05.160 --> 34:07.239
but definitely not Napoleon's.

34:07.240 --> 34:09.159
It's a replica.
Donald was devastated.

34:09.159 --> 34:12.639
Come on.
Let's go somewhere more private.

34:12.639 --> 34:14.478
Come on!

34:14.480 --> 34:17.839
Can I please just have one drink?

34:17.840 --> 34:19.320
Clint!

34:20.679 --> 34:23.799
No, your left in front.

34:23.800 --> 34:26.599
Feels weird. You'd want to use
both hands to defend yourself.

34:26.600 --> 34:28.239
Why would you just use one?

34:29.880 --> 34:31.679
That wouldn't even cut butter.

34:33.520 --> 34:35.719
You're trying to kill me!
I don't want to hurt you.

34:35.719 --> 34:38.719
Two of Donald's ribs were broken
with one stab wound to the heart.

34:38.719 --> 34:41.679
You've got to give it some welly.
Like this. A bit of force.

34:41.679 --> 34:45.559
No, no, no, because the cuts
on Donald's hands, they were shallow.

34:45.560 --> 34:47.679
Oh! Oh, that means...

34:47.679 --> 34:49.998
Money on the side for chips.
I don't want chips.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.719
And I don't want to move. Beth,
we're in the middle of something.

34:52.719 --> 34:55.279
I've added it up.
I've moved 11 times in 15 years.

34:55.280 --> 34:57.359
I'm on hold.
Can we talk about it later?

34:57.360 --> 35:00.319
Every time you get a new man or get
rid of the last one, we start over.

35:00.320 --> 35:02.319
'Hello. Thank you for waiting.'
I'm sick of it.

35:02.320 --> 35:03.519
I want to stay with Gran.

35:03.520 --> 35:05.519
Hold that thought. 'Hello?'

35:05.520 --> 35:06.879
No, no, no, I'm here, I'm here.

35:06.880 --> 35:07.920
I... Erm...

35:09.080 --> 35:11.679
It's about an insurance policy
for one of your clients.

35:11.680 --> 35:13.520
Sidwell. Donald Sidwell.

35:57.040 --> 35:59.799
Man, I'd kill to wake up
to this every morning.

35:59.800 --> 36:01.879
Not literally, obviously.

36:01.880 --> 36:03.720
Yeah, me, too.

36:05.160 --> 36:06.999
We need to see the Sidwells.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.759
The cuts on Donald's hand,
they weren't defensive marks.

36:09.760 --> 36:11.999
You sure? Yeah. It's the only thing
that makes sense.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.839
And it explains the slashes
on the chair.

36:13.840 --> 36:15.559
They were practice marks.

36:15.560 --> 36:18.399
The call from the insurance company
confirmed it. Confirmed what?

36:18.400 --> 36:20.559
What happened.
Well, what I think happened.

36:20.560 --> 36:23.999
We need to see Dot Saunders,
from the pharmacy.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.360
Was it Edward?

36:39.200 --> 36:42.080
I hear you've arrested Terence.
It wasn't Terence.

36:43.360 --> 36:45.599
Did you know your father's
depression had got worse?

36:45.600 --> 36:49.399
Father wasn't depressed.
That would be admitting weakness.

36:49.400 --> 36:50.879
Father never did that.

36:50.880 --> 36:54.559
His doctor diagnosed him last year,
prescribed him antidepressants.

36:54.560 --> 36:56.360
But he'd stopped taking them.

36:58.040 --> 37:00.879
He went to Dot Saunders' pharmacy
to collect a prescription

37:00.880 --> 37:02.320
when he heard people laughing.

37:04.120 --> 37:07.119
'He thought they were
laughing at him.

37:07.120 --> 37:12.119
'Well, you know how proud
your father was, how private.

37:12.120 --> 37:14.359
'He caused a scene, walked out.

37:14.360 --> 37:16.039
'Too embarrassed to ever go back.'

37:16.040 --> 37:17.360
Shut up!

37:18.880 --> 37:20.799
Did you know he was depressed?

37:20.800 --> 37:23.079
He always seemed so... strong.

37:23.080 --> 37:25.319
I guess he hid it.

37:25.320 --> 37:28.959
And the more he hid it,
the more ill he got.

37:28.960 --> 37:31.199
And when he found out
Napoleon's violin was a fake,

37:31.200 --> 37:33.159
well, that was
the final straw, nearly.

37:33.160 --> 37:35.879
It's not a fake.
We talked to Herriots.

37:35.880 --> 37:38.640
They told us what they told
your father, that it was a replica.

37:39.680 --> 37:41.199
But I think you already knew that.

37:41.200 --> 37:44.480
That's why he was so upset
when he came back from London.

37:46.960 --> 37:49.159
'He knew he was broke.

37:49.160 --> 37:52.399
'And Sidwell Hall was
in negative equity.

37:52.400 --> 37:55.599
'I suspect what happened with Terence
is what finally pushed him over.

37:55.600 --> 37:59.079
'I doubt anyone had ever stood up
to your father the way Terence did.

37:59.080 --> 38:00.999
'It made him feel weak, helpless,

38:01.000 --> 38:03.519
'even more so than
he was already feeling.

38:03.520 --> 38:06.720
'He'd lost the violin.
Knew he would lose his home. He...'

38:08.440 --> 38:11.039
He couldn't cope.
So he tested the knife on his hands,

38:11.040 --> 38:13.720
just enough to draw blood, to see
if he could go through with it.

38:16.440 --> 38:20.519
'Then he stabbed the chair to check
the knife was sharp enough.

38:20.520 --> 38:22.919
'Practice marks.

38:22.920 --> 38:24.000
'And then...

38:25.720 --> 38:27.600
'..then he did it.'

38:35.640 --> 38:37.239
He killed himself.

38:37.240 --> 38:40.119
If he'd committed suicide,
don't you think we'd have told you?

38:40.120 --> 38:43.399
Not if you wanted the payout
from the policy. What policy?

38:43.400 --> 38:45.839
Life-insurance policy.

38:45.840 --> 38:49.439
There's an exclusion for suicide.
They won't pay out.

38:49.440 --> 38:52.239
But they will for murder. Sidwell
Hall wouldn't have to be sold

38:52.240 --> 38:54.199
and you wouldn't have to leave.

38:54.200 --> 38:56.879
When you found the body, you knew
what he'd done. Maybe not why.

38:56.880 --> 38:59.840
But you needed the money,
so you staged a break-in...

39:01.560 --> 39:03.279
..and you made up your alibis.

39:03.280 --> 39:06.359
That's why you wouldn't
let me see him. You knew.

39:06.360 --> 39:08.080
This isn't true.

39:10.120 --> 39:11.520
Tell her.

39:12.960 --> 39:14.800
Please, Edward.

39:16.280 --> 39:17.840
It's over, Livvy.

39:20.120 --> 39:21.959
No...

39:21.960 --> 39:23.800
They know.

39:26.200 --> 39:27.480
No...

39:31.520 --> 39:33.160
Follow me, please.

39:44.600 --> 39:47.680
He wrote it on the back
of the valuation for the violin.

39:49.240 --> 39:50.919
And the knife?

39:50.920 --> 39:54.799
"We, like this violin, are worthless.
Without Sidwell Hall we are nothing.

39:54.800 --> 39:56.879
"I would rather die than be nothing."

39:56.880 --> 40:00.079
I thought it was about selling the
house, that it was stupid pride.

40:00.080 --> 40:03.879
If I'd realised he was depressed,
that he was ill, if I'd known...

40:03.880 --> 40:07.360
He'd never have let you help him.
I'd like to have tried.

40:09.720 --> 40:10.919
Edward and Olivia Sidwell,

40:10.920 --> 40:13.759
I am arresting you for attempting
to pervert the course of justice.

40:13.760 --> 40:16.159
No... You do not have to say
anything, but it may harm your

40:16.160 --> 40:18.999
defence if do not mention when
questioned something that you later

40:19.000 --> 40:21.680
rely on in court. Anything you
do say may be given in evidence.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.240
Can I come with you, please?

40:44.080 --> 40:45.120
Uh-oh...

40:48.480 --> 40:50.279
At least Olivia got to stay.

40:50.280 --> 40:51.840
Till she's remanded.

40:52.960 --> 40:55.239
Listen, you can't move out
of your mum's. Davey...!

40:55.240 --> 40:57.879
Come on, it's great.
It's got the best view in Devon.

40:57.880 --> 40:59.719
The Sidwells,
they had to live together.

40:59.720 --> 41:02.919
But you choose to.
I'd love to live at Judith's.

41:02.920 --> 41:05.480
Whatever you do,
never tell that to Annette.

41:06.640 --> 41:08.599
You know something?

41:08.600 --> 41:09.960
That 50 quid?

41:11.960 --> 41:14.760
You were worth every mile
of that paper round.

41:23.000 --> 41:26.799
Look, I'm sorry, I know
I should have talked to you both.

41:26.800 --> 41:29.479
What do I know?
I'm only your mother.

41:29.480 --> 41:31.160
You can move if you want to.

41:32.560 --> 41:36.519
Look, three women, one bathroom?
It was never going to work. But...

41:36.520 --> 41:38.839
we could put another one in.

41:38.840 --> 41:41.639
There's room downstairs.
If you're up for it.

41:41.640 --> 41:43.799
Oh, she's up for it.
There's no stopping her.

41:43.800 --> 41:46.039
Too much information!
Too much information!

41:46.040 --> 41:47.759
You're paying for it, mind.

41:47.760 --> 41:50.479
Ooh! We could get one of those
walk-in showers,

41:50.480 --> 41:53.480
big enough for two.
Ooh, you saucy mare!

41:56.880 --> 41:58.160
Sorted?

42:01.280 --> 42:02.679
What's this?

42:02.680 --> 42:03.959
It's an old debt.

42:03.960 --> 42:05.920
£50.

42:36.240 --> 42:38.560
All rise for Her Majesty's Coroner.
