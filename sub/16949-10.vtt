00:03.036 --> 00:05.572
{\an8}Previously on
"Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood"...

00:08.842 --> 00:10.610
{\an7}I asked you
if there was any

00:10.677 --> 00:12.512
{\an7}other type of side
fishy business going on.

00:12.579 --> 00:15.515
{\an8}I-- I have not been
totally honest.

00:15.582 --> 00:17.650
{\an8}I have been seeing
both of you.

00:17.717 --> 00:21.020
{\an8}I need you to do
something for me.

00:21.087 --> 00:23.223
{\an8}I want to get
some lipo,

00:23.289 --> 00:25.925
{\an8}and I want you
to pay for it.

00:25.992 --> 00:26.926
{\an7}(laughing)

00:26.993 --> 00:28.228
{\an7}(bleep)

00:28.294 --> 00:30.296
{\an8}I did bring you
something

00:30.363 --> 00:32.899
{\an8}at a lower cost--
a waist trainer.

00:32.966 --> 00:34.467
{\an8}(man)
Ohh!

00:34.534 --> 00:37.036
{\an8}Tell your fat-ass mama
to wear it.

00:37.103 --> 00:39.472
{\an8}(bleep) you!
(bleep) you!

00:39.539 --> 00:41.808
{\an7}I haven't really
been myself.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.777
{\an7}My brother passed away
last year.

00:43.843 --> 00:45.011
{\an7}I haven't really been
able to, like,

00:45.078 --> 00:48.014
{\an7}be committed to somebody
'cause I been so hurt.

00:48.081 --> 00:51.184
{\an7}There will be
a prenup.

00:53.319 --> 00:54.687
{\an7}I have this prenup
in my hand,

00:54.754 --> 00:56.923
{\an7}and I'm-- I'mma just
rip the whole thing up.

00:56.990 --> 00:57.957
{\an8}(cheering)

00:58.024 --> 01:00.126
{\an8}Brandi, Becky found me,

01:00.193 --> 01:02.095
{\an8}and she was not
serving me lemonade.

01:02.162 --> 01:04.297
{\an8}She was serving me
piping-hot tea.

01:04.364 --> 01:05.364
{\an7}You're a mother(bleep)
joke.

01:05.432 --> 01:07.400
{\an8}(murmuring and shrieking)

01:07.467 --> 01:09.402
{\an7}Princess, what the (bleep)
was that?

01:09.469 --> 01:12.005
{\an7}Like, I have to
get her back.

01:12.071 --> 01:14.107
{\an8}You said you had
a little sex tapey tape?

01:15.942 --> 01:17.277
{\an8}I want that
mother(bleep) tape.

01:17.343 --> 01:19.145
{\an7}Maybe there's something
we can do.

01:19.212 --> 01:21.414
{\an8}This is about to be
the biggest receipt.

01:21.481 --> 01:22.682
{\an8}You have a deal.

01:58.751 --> 02:01.621
{\an8}I've really been reflecting on
my love life over the past year,

02:01.688 --> 02:03.056
{\an8}and I think
I've just been bouncing

02:03.122 --> 02:05.158
{\an8}from relationship
to relationship

02:05.225 --> 02:07.293
just to hide the hurt
that I feel inside.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.996
But regardless, I hurt
some great people along the way,

02:10.062 --> 02:12.632
and I do feel bad
about that.

02:12.699 --> 02:14.300
{\an3}(laughing)

02:14.367 --> 02:15.535
{\an3}So...

02:14.367 --> 02:15.535
Hi, beautiful.

02:15.602 --> 02:17.303
So, this is the reason
why you were texting me,

02:17.370 --> 02:19.239
{\an5}asking me for my hours?

02:17.370 --> 02:19.239
{\an1}Yes.

02:19.305 --> 02:21.207
I wanted to be a stalker
and give you some flowers

02:21.274 --> 02:24.511
{\an1}'cause I felt like
I owed you an apology.

02:24.577 --> 02:26.913
{\an8}I haven't seen Nikki
since our last event,

02:26.980 --> 02:29.516
{\an8}and she was really rude
to me and my guest.

02:29.582 --> 02:31.484
If she's trying
to get back with me,

02:31.551 --> 02:33.653
she's gonna have to work
really hard,

02:33.720 --> 02:35.722
and even then,
I don't know.

02:35.788 --> 02:37.690
I'm gonna have to think
about it.

02:37.757 --> 02:39.359
So, look, I wanted to
come and talk to you

02:39.425 --> 02:40.493
because I know
the last time,

02:40.560 --> 02:42.762
when we had the event,
you know,

02:42.829 --> 02:44.898
{\an1}it was a lot of, like,
chaos and craziness,

02:44.964 --> 02:48.234
{\an1}and I know you felt like
my apology was half-assed.

02:48.301 --> 02:50.136
{\an1}Above all,
you are my friend,

02:50.203 --> 02:52.138
{\an1}so, you know,
you didn't deserve that,

02:52.205 --> 02:54.240
and I feel like
maybe I wasn't

02:54.307 --> 02:55.742
{\an1}all the way
honest with you.

02:55.808 --> 02:57.877
I possibly could have just
misled you and everything

02:57.944 --> 02:59.512
when I feel like you
would have understood

02:59.579 --> 03:02.248
if I just told you
what was going on.

03:02.315 --> 03:04.183
I really felt,
like, disrespected,

03:04.250 --> 03:06.219
and I just felt like

03:06.286 --> 03:08.488
{\an1}you were not
being yourself,

03:08.555 --> 03:11.324
{\an1}and I just felt,
you know, betrayed,

03:11.391 --> 03:12.926
and I felt, you know,

03:12.992 --> 03:14.060
{\an1}that you weren't
considerate

03:14.127 --> 03:15.962
{\an1}about my feelings
as a friend.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.330
{\an1}It was just the fact
that I gave you

03:17.397 --> 03:18.731
all my trust...

03:17.397 --> 03:18.731
{\an3}Right.

03:18.798 --> 03:22.468
{\an1}...and you just, like,
walked, like, all over me.

03:22.535 --> 03:25.238
I feel like Nikki,
she took advantage of me.

03:25.305 --> 03:27.407
There was no excuse
for her to lie to me.

03:27.473 --> 03:29.809
I'm not mad at her
actually dating somebody,

03:29.876 --> 03:30.910
but why lie?

03:30.977 --> 03:32.979
I've had a really
hard year, you know,

03:33.046 --> 03:34.581
{\an5}with my brother
passing away...

03:33.046 --> 03:34.581
{\an1}Right.

03:34.647 --> 03:36.516
and, you know,
just things in my life

03:36.583 --> 03:38.851
have just literally
turned upside down.

03:38.918 --> 03:40.520
So, for me,
it's just like

03:40.587 --> 03:42.589
because I've been hurt
in so many different ways,

03:42.655 --> 03:44.424
that I put
this guard up

03:44.490 --> 03:47.193
and maybe did things
out of character,

03:47.260 --> 03:49.495
{\an1}and I feel like it's just
something I have to work on

03:49.562 --> 03:51.030
because I don't
want this to become,

03:51.097 --> 03:53.132
like, a-- a pattern
whether it's with you

03:53.199 --> 03:54.367
or this person
or the next person.

03:54.434 --> 03:55.702
{\an1}I just want you
to know

03:55.768 --> 03:57.337
{\an1}that I've been there
for you.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.806
{\an1}I pride myself
on being a good friend.

03:59.872 --> 04:02.342
{\an1}From now on, just, like,
moving forward,

04:02.408 --> 04:04.811
you don't have to lie
to me about anything.

04:04.877 --> 04:06.946
{\an1}I just wanted to start over
and be-- start clean

04:07.013 --> 04:08.481
and be truthful
to you, you know?

04:08.548 --> 04:11.517
{\an1}All right, so,
you're not lying again?

04:11.584 --> 04:13.419
{\an3}No.

04:13.486 --> 04:15.088
{\an1}We're gonna be honest
with each other.

04:15.154 --> 04:16.322
{\an3}Yes.

04:16.389 --> 04:17.589
{\an5}No shady business.

04:16.389 --> 04:17.589
No shady business.

04:17.656 --> 04:18.591
{\an3}Okay.

04:18.658 --> 04:19.759

for other artists,

04:49.922 --> 04:51.524
{\an8}but this latest banger
felt like the right one

04:51.591 --> 04:53.426
{\an8}for me to come
to front stage.

04:53.493 --> 04:55.328
What's up, though? Y'all trying
to go get some food?

04:55.395 --> 04:57.397
Let's go hit that In-N-Out.
My (bleep)...

04:57.463 --> 04:58.598
{\an5}We have a delivery
coming.

04:57.463 --> 04:58.598
{\an1}What?

04:58.665 --> 05:00.466
It's a surprise.

05:00.533 --> 05:02.969
Since I knew we'd all be
at the studio today,

05:03.036 --> 05:05.972
{\an8}I invited Jason so he could
make good on his promise.

05:06.039 --> 05:09.108
I don't go around just barking
like a dog for nothing.

05:09.175 --> 05:10.410
{\an3}Yo!

05:09.175 --> 05:10.410
{\an1}Hey!

05:10.476 --> 05:11.678
How is everybody?

05:11.744 --> 05:14.414
My boy is in the
mother(bleep) building.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.415
This is the surprise?

05:15.481 --> 05:16.949
This is the surprise.

05:17.016 --> 05:18.451
Last time I checked,

05:18.518 --> 05:20.286
Jason Lee didn't even
(bleep) with Brandi.

05:20.353 --> 05:21.688
{\an8}I mean, they couldn't even
be in a room

05:21.754 --> 05:23.589
{\an8}without somebody throwing
a drink at each other.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.892
{\an8}All I know
is Jason is messy

05:25.958 --> 05:28.261
and Brandi
already does too much.

05:28.327 --> 05:29.662
So, you mix all that up,

05:29.729 --> 05:32.131
and it's just a bunch of
messed-up stuff about to happen.

05:32.198 --> 05:33.399
That's what it is.

05:33.466 --> 05:34.667
I know you all
probably heard

05:34.734 --> 05:36.102
about what Moniece
did to Brandi

05:36.169 --> 05:37.370
at her little
listening party.

05:37.437 --> 05:38.805
{\an8}We have to have one up
on her, basically,

05:38.871 --> 05:41.307
{\an8}because we can't let her
keep doing this to people.

05:41.374 --> 05:43.843
So, we have to just
put her in her place.

05:43.910 --> 05:45.912
{\an5}Well, how you gonna do that?

05:43.910 --> 05:45.912
Because there has to be
an end to this.

05:45.978 --> 05:47.680
That's where Jason
came into play.

05:47.747 --> 05:49.682
So, you saying you found
a skeleton in her closet.

05:49.749 --> 05:51.784
I found a cemetery.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.720
{\an1}So I wanted to come here
and show you.

05:53.786 --> 05:55.555
Well, (bleep),
let's get to the show.

05:55.621 --> 05:57.056
{\an5}How about we put it
on the big screen?

05:55.621 --> 05:57.056
{\an1}Okay.

05:57.123 --> 05:59.192
{\an1}Hey, can we
turn on the...

05:59.258 --> 06:01.961
I don't know what B
and my baby girl is doing,

06:02.028 --> 06:03.296
but it stinks.

06:03.362 --> 06:05.198
We right around the corner
from our wedding.

06:05.264 --> 06:06.999
I don't have time
for this (bleep).

06:07.066 --> 06:08.501
Well, here's an appetizer.

06:10.470 --> 06:11.871
{\an5}What is that?

06:10.470 --> 06:11.871
What is that?

06:11.938 --> 06:13.406
This is Moniece.

06:13.473 --> 06:15.675
{\an3}Face-down.

06:15.742 --> 06:16.709
Oh, my God!

06:16.776 --> 06:18.144
{\an1}Ew!

06:16.776 --> 06:18.144
Ohh!

06:18.211 --> 06:19.579
{\an5}(Max)
This is wack.
(chuckles)

06:19.645 --> 06:20.780
What you doing?

06:20.847 --> 06:22.315
No wonder you can't
keep a (bleep)!

06:22.381 --> 06:24.050
He also has
a hairy butthole.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.986
Oh, my God!
And it's (bleep) funny-looking.

06:27.053 --> 06:28.654
Come on, y'all, man.
I'm going to In-N-Out.

06:28.721 --> 06:30.590
This ain't...
Y'all tripping.

06:30.656 --> 06:32.358
{\an1}I mean, I don't
even want to hear

06:32.425 --> 06:33.626
{\an1}about In-N-Out
right now.

06:33.693 --> 06:35.528
{\an5}Yo, this is corny.

06:33.693 --> 06:35.528
What you so angry for?

06:35.595 --> 06:37.163
This is wack.
It's corny.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.898
{\an5}I know her mama.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.898
{\an1}You don't get
what I'm saying.

06:38.965 --> 06:40.900
Her mama plays tennis
with my sister.

06:40.967 --> 06:43.035
{\an1}I don't care you you know--
her mother or whoever.

06:43.102 --> 06:44.370
(Bleep) Moniece.

06:44.437 --> 06:45.872
{\an5}Jason...

06:44.437 --> 06:45.872
{\an1}It's karma.
You know why it's karma?

06:45.938 --> 06:47.907
Don't do nothing with that, man.
You know what I'm saying?

06:47.974 --> 06:49.742
{\an5}I'm just delivering...

06:47.974 --> 06:49.742
It's not cool.

06:49.809 --> 06:51.210
...a gift to you all.

06:51.277 --> 06:54.347
Look, me and Moniece,
we far from friends, okay?

06:54.413 --> 06:56.082
But this?
Come on, man.

06:56.149 --> 06:59.752
Like, my future wife
cannot be going to this level.

06:59.819 --> 07:01.020
This is not the subject

07:01.087 --> 07:03.289
anybody should be
playing around with.

07:03.356 --> 07:04.690
It's not cool.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.092
Trust me, I know.

07:06.159 --> 07:07.794
I'll see you all later.

07:07.860 --> 07:08.928
{\an3}Hold on.

07:10.963 --> 07:13.599
I don't know why Ray's getting
all bent out of shape over this.

07:13.666 --> 07:15.268
Two words: Kim Kardashian.

07:15.334 --> 07:16.536
But either way,
my hands are clean.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.004
I'm just the messenger.

07:18.070 --> 07:20.339
I don't feel bad
because she's sitting up,

07:20.406 --> 07:23.042
lying about me
and my (bleep) family

07:23.109 --> 07:24.343
in front of a room
full of people,

07:24.410 --> 07:25.678
calling it
the naked truth.

07:25.745 --> 07:27.747
{\an1}I think you're definitely
in a position

07:27.814 --> 07:29.916
to make her apologize.

07:29.982 --> 07:31.450
But I am gonna tell Fizz

07:31.517 --> 07:33.886
'cause that's my (bleep)
and I think he needs to know.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.355
At the end of the day,
Moniece started it,

07:36.422 --> 07:38.658
and we the type of people
to finish (bleep).

07:38.724 --> 07:41.527
I know Fizz is my man,
but at the same time,

07:41.594 --> 07:43.429
we're not gonna
just sit by

07:43.496 --> 07:45.064
and let this girl
get away with murder.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.899
We're gonna confront her
with her dirt,

07:46.966 --> 07:48.301
let her know we got it,

07:48.367 --> 07:50.670
and give her a chance
to conform and apologize.

07:50.736 --> 07:51.737
That's the naked truth.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.241
♪♪

07:58.244 --> 08:00.913
Even though my wife
is pissed at me,

08:00.980 --> 08:03.149
{\an8}I'm still floating
on cloud nine

08:03.216 --> 08:04.250
{\an8}from giving her mom

08:04.317 --> 08:06.018
{\an8}that waist trainer
at the barbecue.

08:06.085 --> 08:07.620
Who made this?

08:07.687 --> 08:09.589
I don't know.
Think my mom.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.657
{\an8}Bro, your mom
needs some sugar.

08:11.724 --> 08:12.992
Oops.
(chuckles)

08:22.768 --> 08:24.170
They towing your car.

08:24.237 --> 08:26.572
{\an5}What you mean?

08:24.237 --> 08:26.572
{\an1}Hurry.

08:28.007 --> 08:29.208
{\an1}(bleep)

08:29.275 --> 08:30.209
{\an1}(A1)
Yo...

08:30.276 --> 08:32.044
what you doing?

08:32.111 --> 08:33.679
Doing my job.

08:33.746 --> 08:35.147
{\an1}(A1)
Give me them keys, bro.

08:35.214 --> 08:36.315
You ain't towing
nothing.

08:36.381 --> 08:37.683
You're gonna respect
my man's car.

08:37.750 --> 08:38.751
You're not towing
(bleep).

08:38.818 --> 08:40.253
Take your thing.
Now, come on.

08:40.318 --> 08:43.155
{\an5}(A1)
Am I tripping, bro?
Who sent you to do this?

08:43.222 --> 08:44.423
Lyrica Garrett.

08:44.490 --> 08:46.659
Oh, I see
what's going on here.

08:46.726 --> 08:49.495
When I first got the car,
I had credit issues,

08:49.562 --> 08:51.664
so her mom got it
in her name.

08:51.731 --> 08:53.199
Well, she got
another thing coming

08:53.266 --> 08:56.969
if she think I'm gonna just
let her get away with this.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.572
Ah, man!

08:59.639 --> 09:01.507
If I'm such a bad person,

09:01.574 --> 09:05.044
then why would I have allowed A1
to get a car in my name?

09:05.111 --> 09:07.613
A1 should have learned
from his mama

09:07.680 --> 09:09.415
{\an8}don't bite the hand
that feeds you.

09:09.482 --> 09:12.118
{\an8}Oh, well.
Too late now, buddy.

09:12.184 --> 09:13.319
You had him tow the car?

09:13.386 --> 09:15.054
{\an1}It's my car.
I own it.

09:15.121 --> 09:17.056
{\an5}(tow truck driver)
Watch the truck, man.
Get off the truck, man.

09:17.123 --> 09:18.591
You know,
I've been in situations

09:18.658 --> 09:20.927
where a tow truck driver
has came and taken my car.

09:20.993 --> 09:22.929
So when I saw this
happening to A1,

09:22.995 --> 09:24.563
I just felt
like I wanted to help.

09:24.630 --> 09:25.731
I paid the car off.

09:25.798 --> 09:27.133
I told you,
don't (bleep) do that.

09:27.199 --> 09:28.834
Yeah, you ain't got nothing
to do with it.

09:28.901 --> 09:30.670
{\an5}I'm his mom--

09:28.901 --> 09:30.670
You don't (bleep)
nothing to do with it.

09:30.736 --> 09:33.739
{\an1}I told you, don't (bleep)
pay this bitch-ass car off!

09:33.806 --> 09:36.309
{\an5}(Pam)
This lady really needs
to get a hobby.

09:36.375 --> 09:39.412
She's so bitter and unsatisfied
with her own life,

09:39.478 --> 09:41.981
but towing my son's car
is cross the line.

09:42.048 --> 09:45.217
So, you're gonna tow the car,
and I just paid for it.

09:45.284 --> 09:48.587
Well, it's my car.
I have the pink slip.

09:48.654 --> 09:50.923
{\an5}I kept telling you--

09:48.654 --> 09:50.923
It's cool.

09:50.990 --> 09:53.192
{\an1}It wasn't your money
that (bleep) paid for it!

09:53.259 --> 09:55.061
If she keeps talking,
it's gonna be a problem.

09:55.127 --> 09:57.229
I don't give a (bleep)!

09:57.296 --> 09:58.230
{\an1}Come on!

09:58.297 --> 09:59.665
{\an1}Come on!
Bitch!

09:59.732 --> 10:03.336
Lyrica's mom is nothing
but a spiteful, bitter woman.

10:03.402 --> 10:05.838
I let a lot of (bleep)
slide under the rug,

10:05.905 --> 10:09.308
but she's not getting away
with this one this time.

10:09.375 --> 10:10.443
{\an1}(Lyrica Garrett)
Here.

10:10.509 --> 10:12.845
{\an1}I have your money
right here.

10:12.912 --> 10:14.780
Here's your money.

10:14.847 --> 10:16.582
{\an5}Take the car.

10:14.847 --> 10:16.582
Stupid ass (bleep)!

10:16.649 --> 10:18.050
I'm gonna take
your (bleep).

10:18.117 --> 10:19.685
Then I'm gonna
call the police.

10:19.752 --> 10:21.320
{\an5}(Bleep) you.

10:19.752 --> 10:21.320
Call the police.

10:21.387 --> 10:23.222
Next time you want
to play car thief,

10:23.289 --> 10:25.257
make sure you don't leave
your own keys

10:25.324 --> 10:27.760
in your car, genius.
Deuces.

10:27.827 --> 10:30.463
{\an1}Now let's see you pay
for this mother(bleep)!

10:30.529 --> 10:32.732
{\an1}Since you doing that,
you poor bitch!

10:32.798 --> 10:34.767
{\an5}You want to talk to me?

10:32.798 --> 10:34.767
Come on, bitch!

10:34.834 --> 10:35.901
{\an1}Come on!

10:35.968 --> 10:37.903
I swear to God,
I'll (bleep) you up!

10:37.970 --> 10:40.139
I don't ever want
to be around her.

10:40.206 --> 10:41.874
What the hell is wrong
with these people?

10:41.941 --> 10:43.242
Who the hell would say,
"You know what?

10:43.309 --> 10:45.144
I'm gonna get
my son-in-law's car towed."

10:45.211 --> 10:47.279
Them people, they're putting
some mad vibes out.

10:47.346 --> 10:48.347
You see me?

10:48.414 --> 10:49.648
{\an1}You mad 'cause my son
won't give you

10:49.715 --> 10:51.150
no money, bitch!

10:51.217 --> 10:52.485
Your son don't have
no money.

10:52.551 --> 10:54.520
That's why he's driving
my car.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.322
No, I tell you what!

10:56.389 --> 10:57.723
You gonna see, bitch.

10:57.790 --> 11:00.659
Okay, so take it away.

11:04.530 --> 11:06.265
{\an8}It takes a lot of work
to be married,

11:06.332 --> 11:08.167
{\an8}and I-- I don't know
whether Princess

11:08.234 --> 11:10.736
{\an8}is at that point where she
really wants to work on it.

11:10.803 --> 11:12.638
{\an8}I wish you had
a better mom.

11:12.705 --> 11:14.240
{\an8}You act jealous of my mom.

11:14.306 --> 11:16.675
{\an7}What am I jealous of?
You ain't (bleep).

11:18.144 --> 11:20.012
{\an8}There's a sex tape
floating around.

11:18.144 --> 11:20.012
{\an7}Uh-huh.

11:20.079 --> 11:22.014
{\an8}And you not calling
me about it...

11:20.079 --> 11:22.014
{\an7}Yeah.

11:22.081 --> 11:24.383
{\an7}...is obviously
exploiting some bull(bleep).

11:36.629 --> 11:38.564
{\an5}(Ray J)
After Princess reassured me
that we not gonna get

11:38.631 --> 11:41.100
our sleeves dirty with all
of this Moniece bull(bleep),

11:41.167 --> 11:42.802
we kissed and we made up,

11:42.868 --> 11:44.336
and now that Princess
told me to get involved

11:44.403 --> 11:48.040
with the actual wedding plans,
I got some big ideas.

11:48.107 --> 11:51.610
{\an1}So, it's gonna be a few inserts
with the invitation.

11:51.677 --> 11:52.745
{\an1}Okay.

11:52.812 --> 11:54.713
I'm getting it now.
Baby, you okay?

11:54.780 --> 11:58.117
Whatever-- whatever
my woman wanna do, you know?

11:58.184 --> 11:59.919
{\an5}(Princess)
During this whole
wedding planning process,

11:59.985 --> 12:02.721
{\an8}Ray has been saying
it's whatever I want.

12:02.788 --> 12:04.924
Well, I hope that
that's true,

12:04.990 --> 12:06.792
because Ray's mom Sonja
is supposed to be here

12:06.859 --> 12:09.095
so she can see everything
that we've been up to.

12:09.161 --> 12:10.729
The wedding is right
around the corner,

12:10.796 --> 12:13.265
so we don't really
have time for changes.

12:13.332 --> 12:16.335
What's up, Mama?

12:13.332 --> 12:16.335
{\an1}Wow.

12:16.402 --> 12:17.436
You know Diane?

12:17.503 --> 12:18.404
{\an5}Nice to see you again.

12:17.503 --> 12:18.404
Yes, uh-huh.

12:18.471 --> 12:19.472
{\an1}Yes.

12:18.471 --> 12:19.472
Nice to see you.

12:19.538 --> 12:21.273
{\an8}Show her the invitation.

12:19.538 --> 12:21.273
{\an7}All right.

12:21.340 --> 12:23.843
Do you like that?

12:23.909 --> 12:26.645
How come Princess
got her "P" first?

12:29.215 --> 12:32.985
I got my "P" first
because I'm the bride, Sonja.

12:33.052 --> 12:36.122
{\an7}(Sonja)
Can I be honest?

12:33.052 --> 12:36.122
{\an5}Yes, please.

12:36.188 --> 12:39.492
{\an7}If I were in
the colonial days...

12:36.188 --> 12:39.492
{\an9}Yes.

12:39.558 --> 12:42.428
{\an7}...back when King Leonardo
and all of those people

12:42.495 --> 12:45.965
{\an1}were around,
this would be perfect, okay?

12:46.031 --> 12:48.434
But this is way too much.

12:48.501 --> 12:51.203
{\an1}(stammering)
Wings?

12:51.270 --> 12:52.805
Okay, first of all,
I don't even think

12:52.872 --> 12:54.974
there even was
a King Leonardo.

12:55.040 --> 12:58.310
Secondly, you just basically
popped up out of nowhere

12:58.377 --> 13:00.312
tearing our ideas to shreds.

13:00.379 --> 13:02.214
{\an1}I got it.

13:00.379 --> 13:02.214
What?

13:02.281 --> 13:04.150
I wanna go "Coming To America",

13:04.216 --> 13:07.219
{\an1}but I wanna go modern-day
"Coming To America".

13:07.286 --> 13:11.423
{\an1}I would do chrome chairs,
chrome tables.

13:11.490 --> 13:15.995
{\an1}I think that the roses
could be black and gold roses.

13:16.061 --> 13:18.597
{\an1}You know, roses that
are different

13:18.664 --> 13:19.899
from some other
kind of country.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.367
{\an5}But babe.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.367
Let's bring it back.

13:21.433 --> 13:24.170
You can't just change
everything all of a sudden.

13:24.236 --> 13:25.371
{\an4}Diane?

13:24.236 --> 13:25.371
We only have a couple weeks.

13:25.437 --> 13:26.705
We want the wedding
to look like this.

13:26.772 --> 13:28.174
And you haven't been here.

13:28.240 --> 13:29.975
Princess wanted me to put
my all into this wedding,

13:30.042 --> 13:31.243
and I'm doing it.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.012
So, why are you tripping
with me and my mama,

13:33.078 --> 13:34.647
got our opinion
on the wedding?

13:34.713 --> 13:36.649
Ain't that a little bit
contradictive?

13:36.715 --> 13:38.417
{\an1}So, obviously we're gonna
make some changes.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.920
{\an6}Okay.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.920
We're going more--
less traditional,

13:40.986 --> 13:42.788
{\an5}more modern.

13:40.986 --> 13:42.788
Still traditional,

13:42.855 --> 13:45.024
but a little more modern,
whatever Princess want.

13:45.090 --> 13:46.592
{\an1}I just need you
to tell me what you want.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.594
{\an5}We want it to look
like a black tie.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.594
So, you're saying black,

13:48.661 --> 13:50.229
{\an1}but then you said
what Princess wants.

13:50.296 --> 13:52.431
Black tie,
but what Princess want.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.200
{\an5}(Princess)
Why is Diane
even paying attention

13:54.266 --> 13:56.535
to any of Ray's
suggestions right now?

13:56.602 --> 13:58.170
This wedding is like
in five minutes,

13:58.237 --> 14:01.040
and there's no way I'm letting
them change everything now.

14:01.106 --> 14:04.376
Sonja, Ray can come up
in here and throw around

14:04.443 --> 14:07.880
as many ideas as they want,
but truth be told,

14:07.947 --> 14:10.082
at the end of the day,
this bride

14:10.149 --> 14:11.483
will have the last say.

14:11.550 --> 14:13.052
{\an4}(Ray)
Make that happen
for us, Diane.

14:13.118 --> 14:15.120
{\an1}Got it, so I'll see
you guys again.

14:15.187 --> 14:16.755
Appreciate it.

14:15.187 --> 14:16.755
{\an1}Soon.

14:16.822 --> 14:18.023
{\an5}We'll talk soon?

14:16.822 --> 14:18.023
Yes.

14:18.090 --> 14:19.024
Like today?

14:18.090 --> 14:19.024
{\an1}Yeah.

14:19.091 --> 14:20.159
{\an1}Okay.

14:20.226 --> 14:21.227
{\an5}(Ray)
One love.

14:20.226 --> 14:21.227
{\an1}Got it.

14:21.293 --> 14:24.129
Slow motion.

14:21.293 --> 14:24.129
{\an1}Bye, guys.

14:24.196 --> 14:26.932
(sighs)
Jesus, help me.

14:31.971 --> 14:33.505
(Lyrica)
A girl cannot catch a break.

14:33.572 --> 14:35.941
{\an8}I'm out trying to have lunch
with a few of my friends,

14:36.008 --> 14:39.111
{\an8}and I look at my phone,
and I have so many phone calls

14:39.178 --> 14:41.513
from my mom and A1
blowing me up.

14:41.580 --> 14:43.816
Yo, what's going on?

14:43.882 --> 14:46.051
Why is my mom's car
parked out there

14:46.118 --> 14:47.853
and she's not--
where is she?

14:47.920 --> 14:49.054
Like, what's up?

14:49.121 --> 14:50.956
{\an1}Did you see
the car in the front?

14:51.023 --> 14:52.725
I didn't even look
for our car.

14:52.791 --> 14:54.226
Car is towed.

14:54.293 --> 14:56.228
Why is the car towed?

14:56.295 --> 14:57.630
{\an1}'Cause your mama
towed it.

14:57.696 --> 14:59.131
Why did she tow it?

14:59.198 --> 15:01.934
{\an1}She said, "The car's
in my name, I'm towing it."

15:02.001 --> 15:03.636
{\an5}That's why I didn't wanna--

15:02.001 --> 15:03.636
She's-- I mean..

15:03.702 --> 15:05.304
She's what?
It's towed.

15:05.371 --> 15:06.905
I mean, I need to just--
I need to talk to her

15:06.972 --> 15:07.906
to get the car back.

15:07.973 --> 15:09.842
None of this
makes any sense.

15:09.908 --> 15:11.176
Like, why would she do that?

15:11.243 --> 15:13.145
She knows we only have
one car right now.

15:13.212 --> 15:14.580
Can I tell you this?

15:14.647 --> 15:16.815
{\an1}You a nice-looking
young woman.

15:16.882 --> 15:18.751
I wish you had
a better mom.

15:18.817 --> 15:22.121
{\an1}Her vibes
reflects on you.

15:22.187 --> 15:24.857
{\an1}When she have an attitude,
you have one.

15:24.923 --> 15:26.425
You act jealous
of my mom.

15:26.492 --> 15:28.027
{\an4}Oh.

15:26.492 --> 15:28.027
And I believe that you are.

15:28.093 --> 15:29.261
{\an4}Oh, Lord.

15:28.093 --> 15:29.261
And I believe
that you're jealous

15:29.328 --> 15:31.263
{\an5}of our relationship too.

15:29.328 --> 15:31.263
What am I jealous of?

15:31.330 --> 15:33.565
{\an8}What do I have
to be jealous of?

15:33.632 --> 15:35.467
{\an8}I can buy boobs, butts,

15:35.534 --> 15:37.703
and call myself
Hollywood too.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.772
I can take a mic
and say, "Aaah"

15:39.838 --> 15:41.774
{\an1}and sing like
a (bleep) horse.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.876
What are you
laughing at?

15:43.942 --> 15:45.411
{\an5}(vocalizing)

15:43.942 --> 15:45.411
You can't sing.

15:45.477 --> 15:46.612
What the (bleep)?

15:45.477 --> 15:46.612
{\an3}Listen.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.213
{\an5}You gotta sing!

15:46.679 --> 15:48.213
You can't (bleep) sing.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.715
You're not gonna sit here
and talk about my mom,

15:49.782 --> 15:52.151
{\an5}I'm sick of it, boo.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.151
{\an1}And that's why
her lips are (bleep) up.

15:52.217 --> 15:53.986
And that's why your nose
is (bleep) up.

15:54.053 --> 15:56.455
{\an5}Lyrica.

15:54.053 --> 15:56.455
And that's why your
nose is (bleep) up.

15:56.522 --> 15:57.790
{\an5}Yo.

15:56.522 --> 15:57.790
That's why your nose--

15:57.856 --> 15:59.224
You're not gonna talk
about my mom like that

15:59.291 --> 16:00.626
and say her lips
is (bleep) up.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.961
{\an5}Her back, good ass.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.961
{\an1}She do got
the back fat lips.

16:03.028 --> 16:05.030
Yo.

16:05.097 --> 16:06.699
Don't (bleep) talk
about my mom.

16:06.765 --> 16:08.834
{\an4}You better chill out.
Chill out.

16:06.765 --> 16:08.834
Watch out! Get off me!

16:08.901 --> 16:11.570
Lyrica and my mom are both
hitting below the belt.

16:11.637 --> 16:14.106
{\an8}But Lyrica and I are supposed
to be the bigger people

16:14.173 --> 16:15.708
{\an8}and rise above this (bleep).

16:15.774 --> 16:18.177
I'm really disappointed
in Lyrica right now.

16:18.243 --> 16:20.446
When is this nonsense
gonna stop?

16:20.512 --> 16:21.580
You wanna step to me?

16:21.647 --> 16:23.315
{\an1}I'mma show your ass
who's the king.

16:23.382 --> 16:24.883
Good, you just want
us to divorce,

16:24.950 --> 16:26.518
{\an5}so go marry your son.

16:24.950 --> 16:26.518
Step to me, step to me.

16:26.585 --> 16:27.686
Go marry your son.

16:27.753 --> 16:29.355
Pam resents the fact
that A1

16:29.421 --> 16:31.857
pays more attention
to me than he does to her.

16:31.924 --> 16:34.226
She was disrespectful when
she was staying at our house,

16:34.293 --> 16:35.961
and by the way she's talking
right about now,

16:36.028 --> 16:39.198
she obviously still feels
a certain type of way about me.

16:39.264 --> 16:40.899
You little spoiled bitch.

16:40.966 --> 16:42.835
See?
You heard it?

16:42.901 --> 16:44.036
{\an5}You heard it?

16:42.901 --> 16:44.036
I'm not trying
to hear that.

16:44.103 --> 16:45.571
You heard it?
Watch out, you heard it?

16:45.637 --> 16:47.906
My mom, she was wrong
for towing that car.

16:47.973 --> 16:50.142
But A1, he escalated this first

16:50.209 --> 16:52.378
by embarrassing her
at that barbecue.

16:52.444 --> 16:54.613
I hope that little joke
was worth putting our marriage

16:54.680 --> 16:56.515
and this family in jeopardy,

16:56.582 --> 16:58.417
because right now,
I'm about over A1

16:58.484 --> 16:59.918
and both of our moms.

16:59.985 --> 17:01.086
Go that way.
You heard it, go that way.

17:01.153 --> 17:02.488
{\an1}You're being
disrespectful.

17:02.554 --> 17:03.856
You ain't (bleep).

17:02.554 --> 17:03.856
{\an3}Tripping.

17:03.922 --> 17:05.523
{\an1}I ain't your kid,
mother(bleep).

17:08.460 --> 17:09.962
{\an8}I wanna get married,
I want kids,

17:10.028 --> 17:11.663
{\an8}and I want a small dog.

17:11.730 --> 17:12.931
{\an8}The dog's name
is gonna be Bogdan.

17:12.998 --> 17:14.165
{\an8}Can you focus?

17:14.233 --> 17:16.268
{\an8}So, where'd this tape
come from?

17:16.335 --> 17:17.603
{\an8}Jason Lee got the tape.

17:17.669 --> 17:19.405
{\an7}If you need me to hit Jason up,
I'll hit Jason up--

17:19.471 --> 17:21.473
{\an8}I got Jason's number.

17:19.471 --> 17:21.473
{\an7}Okay.

17:32.851 --> 17:34.486
{\an8}Excuse me, folks,
would you care

17:34.553 --> 17:35.888
{\an8}to try some of
the bottom sirloin?

17:35.954 --> 17:37.990
{\an8}Yeah, just a piece, please.

17:38.056 --> 17:39.525
So, Princess have
some wedding stuff

17:39.591 --> 17:41.293
she has to handle,
so she'll meet up with us

17:41.360 --> 17:42.628
for lunch in a little bit.

17:42.694 --> 17:44.329
So, this is perfect,
because my mama,

17:44.396 --> 17:47.733
she really wants to get
that mother-son bond in first.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.169
What you are about to do
is very, very serious,

17:50.235 --> 17:53.539
{\an1}and I can't stop you from
doing something, you're grown.

17:53.605 --> 17:57.009
{\an1}But I think marriage
is a very serious commitment,

17:57.075 --> 18:00.279
and I think that marriage,
the institution of marriage

18:00.345 --> 18:02.781
requires a lot of work
on both parts,

18:02.848 --> 18:05.751
and that it's not
something that should be,

18:05.818 --> 18:08.253
you know, today
and different tomorrow,

18:08.320 --> 18:10.722
or something that you're
not willing to work on.

18:10.789 --> 18:14.393
{\an8}I have been married
for 41 years.

18:14.460 --> 18:16.328
{\an8}It is not an easy journey.

18:16.395 --> 18:19.932
I don't quite know
whether Ray and Princess

18:19.998 --> 18:22.134
have really thought through
this whole thing.

18:22.201 --> 18:23.869
I'd rather see you
not married

18:23.936 --> 18:25.437
than to see you married

18:25.504 --> 18:30.742
{\an1}and remotely have to go
through those kind of changes,

18:30.809 --> 18:32.077
{\an5}'cause it's hard getting--

18:30.809 --> 18:32.077
{\an1}Well, Ma.

18:32.144 --> 18:33.378
It's hard getting out
of a marriage right.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.214
{\an7}Yeah, but Ma,
with me, you know,

18:35.280 --> 18:38.217
{\an7}I've only lived my life
strategically.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.519
{\an1}You know that,
you know what I'm saying?

18:40.586 --> 18:42.821
{\an1}You know that, Mama,
you know I love you too.

18:52.297 --> 18:53.799
{\an1}I understand
what you're saying,

18:53.866 --> 18:55.968
{\an1}and I get it, and nobody
should change

18:56.034 --> 18:57.469
{\an1}who they are
to do anything.

18:57.536 --> 18:59.404
Women are vicious,
and what happens

18:59.471 --> 19:01.340
is that when they get
married to somebody

19:01.406 --> 19:03.208
and they feel like,
"Oh, my God,

19:03.275 --> 19:05.644
"I'm married now,
I gotta have kids.

19:05.711 --> 19:08.614
{\an1}"If I have kids, guess what?
He's gotta take care of me

19:08.680 --> 19:10.215
{\an5}and he's gotta
take care of the kids."

19:08.680 --> 19:10.215
Yeah, but Ma, Ma...

19:10.282 --> 19:12.751
{\an5}"I gotta pay alimony
and child support."

19:10.282 --> 19:12.751
Ma, Ma, Ma.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.186
Are you serious, Ray?

19:14.253 --> 19:18.257
{\an5}(Sonja)
Their relationship
has been very rocky,

19:18.323 --> 19:20.626
and then all of a sudden,
you talk about getting married?

19:20.692 --> 19:21.927
Why now?

19:21.994 --> 19:24.596
Could we not wait just
a couple of more years?

19:26.465 --> 19:28.800
I don't want you to say
anything until I'm done.

19:28.867 --> 19:32.104
You can nod your head.
But until I'm done,

19:32.170 --> 19:33.305
I wanna be able
to say this,

19:33.372 --> 19:36.675
because I'm not necessarily

19:36.742 --> 19:37.910
in agreement with you
being married.

19:37.976 --> 19:40.979
{\an5}Hello.

19:37.976 --> 19:40.979
Oh, hey, Princess.

19:41.046 --> 19:43.749
{\an5}(Princess)
Sonja wanted
some alone time with Ray,

19:43.815 --> 19:46.785
and after the way she acted
at the venue,

19:46.852 --> 19:49.288
{\an8}I was more than happy
to give them that time together.

19:49.354 --> 19:53.425
But I didn't expect to walk in
on this kind of conversation.

19:53.492 --> 19:55.994
{\an1}I just said to him
that I wasn't really thrilled,

19:56.061 --> 19:57.763
you know, really,
really thrilled

19:57.829 --> 19:59.698
about him getting married.

19:59.765 --> 20:01.366
{\an1}I knew that.
Did you know that?

20:01.433 --> 20:03.969
No.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.138
{\an1}The reason why
I'm a little bit apprehensive

20:06.204 --> 20:09.641
about you getting married
is because

20:09.708 --> 20:11.777
it takes a lot
of work to be married,

20:11.843 --> 20:14.713
{\an1}and I-- I don't know whether
you're at that point

20:14.780 --> 20:16.281
where you really
wanna work on it.

20:16.348 --> 20:18.183
I don't know whether
Princess is at that point

20:18.250 --> 20:20.118
where she really wants
to work on it.

20:20.185 --> 20:23.355
I may have had my suspicions
that she didn't like me.

20:23.422 --> 20:25.390
But for her to just
say it to my face

20:25.457 --> 20:28.760
is just downright disrespectful
and it's rude.

20:28.827 --> 20:31.096
Since I'm not close
to my own family,

20:31.163 --> 20:33.999
I was really hoping that
once Ray and I got married,

20:34.066 --> 20:37.369
I would be welcomed into his.
But, I guess not.

20:37.436 --> 20:38.704
You can take some of
the things that I've said

20:38.770 --> 20:40.072
and you can discard it

20:40.138 --> 20:41.940
as though that they've
never been said before.

20:42.007 --> 20:44.843
But it's just a heads up.

20:44.910 --> 20:49.047
I know that Ray loves me,
but what if her doubts about me

20:49.114 --> 20:51.483
start to affect him?

20:58.256 --> 21:00.158
{\an5}(Safaree)
Nikki hit me up
to meet up today,

21:00.225 --> 21:02.160
and I haven't seen her
since she ambushed me

21:02.227 --> 21:04.229
{\an8}with some random fan from Miami.

21:04.296 --> 21:07.032
{\an8}So, I'mma go see what's up,
because I'm hoping me and her

21:07.099 --> 21:09.301
can really talk and figure
some things out one-on-one,

21:09.368 --> 21:10.969
you know, no games.

21:11.036 --> 21:13.705
Just a real genuine
heart-to-heart.

21:15.207 --> 21:16.575
{\an8}Mm.
How you doing?

21:16.642 --> 21:17.943
{\an8}Good, how are you?

21:18.010 --> 21:19.244
{\an8}You sitting here?

21:19.311 --> 21:20.912
{\an7}Yeah, I'm gonna sit
right here.

21:20.979 --> 21:23.015
{\an5}(Nikki)
Safaree's been nothing
but honest and open with me

21:23.081 --> 21:24.716
from the beginning,
and I do feel bad

21:24.783 --> 21:27.753
because I was being
a little bit of a player.

21:27.819 --> 21:30.055
{\an8}I can't lie, I kinda miss him,
and I hate the way

21:30.122 --> 21:31.690
{\an8}we left things
last time I saw him.

21:31.757 --> 21:33.225
So, what's going on?

21:33.291 --> 21:35.694
I had my heart
all the way in you,

21:35.761 --> 21:37.329
and that was it, right?

21:37.396 --> 21:40.065
And plus, you know,
after the situation

21:40.132 --> 21:42.200
{\an5}with you in Miami--

21:40.132 --> 21:42.200
Hold on, hold on.

21:42.267 --> 21:44.302
I don't know
who that person was.

21:44.369 --> 21:46.371
{\an1}I wasn't there, so I can't
say I believed it.

21:46.438 --> 21:48.006
{\an1}This is my point,
I'm saying is,

21:48.073 --> 21:49.608
{\an1}I wasn't all the way
honest with you,

21:49.675 --> 21:51.043
{\an5}I kinda (bleep) up.

21:49.675 --> 21:51.043
Yeah, so then--

21:51.109 --> 21:52.344
I don't know what
happened with you.

21:52.411 --> 21:54.112
{\an1}No, 'cause if it did,
I wouldn't have lied to you.

21:54.179 --> 21:55.681
{\an5}Okay, well--

21:54.179 --> 21:55.681
'Cause I'd have been like,

21:55.747 --> 21:57.516
{\an1}you know what, you was doing
what you were doing with Rosa.

21:57.582 --> 21:58.784
{\an5}You're right.

21:57.582 --> 21:58.784
We not officially together--

21:58.850 --> 22:00.385
{\an1}I don't wanna keep talking
'bout you, me

22:00.452 --> 22:01.520
and this Rosa thing.

22:01.586 --> 22:02.854
{\an1}I acknowledge
my fault in it.

22:02.921 --> 22:05.557
So, you're saying
we start over?

22:05.624 --> 22:07.225
{\an1}Yeah.

22:07.292 --> 22:08.894
{\an1}I mean, I do want
a relationship.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.929
I wanna get married,
I want kids,

22:10.996 --> 22:12.431
and I want
a small dog.

22:12.497 --> 22:14.866
{\an5}We're not getting a dog.

22:12.497 --> 22:14.866
No matter how small
the dog is,

22:14.933 --> 22:16.435
the dog's name
is gonna be Bogdan.

22:16.501 --> 22:18.236
Can you focus?

22:18.303 --> 22:21.673
{\an1}All right, well, I wanna rub
my coconut oil on you.

22:21.740 --> 22:23.875
{\an1}I'll see.
It depends how I feel.

22:23.942 --> 22:25.377
{\an3}Okay.

22:25.444 --> 22:28.180
All right,
so we're gonna work on

22:28.246 --> 22:30.348
trying to make this serious?

22:30.415 --> 22:31.950
{\an1}Yeah.

22:30.415 --> 22:31.950
{\an3}Okay, so--

22:32.017 --> 22:33.318
{\an5}I'm not being funny.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.318
{\an3}I'm not--

22:33.385 --> 22:35.187
I'm not gonna talk
to nobody,

22:35.253 --> 22:37.723
and you're not
gonna talk to nobody else,

22:37.789 --> 22:39.858
nobody including Rosa,
right?

22:42.260 --> 22:43.595
{\an1}She will always
be my friend.

22:43.662 --> 22:45.330
{\an1}I didn't say that, I'm not--
I'm not ever gonna try

22:45.397 --> 22:47.466
{\an5}to control who your
friends are and stuff.

22:45.397 --> 22:47.466
{\an1}Right.

22:47.532 --> 22:50.068
{\an1}What I'm saying is her
and I will remain friends,

22:50.135 --> 22:51.570
always, but that's it,

22:51.636 --> 22:52.904
{\an1}that I don't have
anybody else.

22:52.971 --> 22:55.407
I don't know about
having kids right now,

22:55.474 --> 22:57.743
or a marriage,
or even a small dog,

22:57.809 --> 22:59.711
but it is nice to talk
about the future.

22:59.778 --> 23:02.914
And honestly, I can't even think
of a sweeter guy than Safaree.

23:02.981 --> 23:04.883
{\an1}Can you give me a hug
so I can go?

23:04.950 --> 23:06.318
Where you gotta go?

23:06.384 --> 23:07.753
{\an1}I have some business
to handle.

23:07.819 --> 23:08.920
{\an5}What you gotta
go do though?

23:07.819 --> 23:08.920
See, there you go.

23:08.987 --> 23:10.322
{\an1}I gotta go to the club
and stuff,

23:10.388 --> 23:11.790
I gotta handle some stuff.

23:11.857 --> 23:13.825
{\an1}It's 4:00 in the afternoon,
ain't nothing to do in the club.

23:13.892 --> 23:15.560
{\an1}Yeah, there is.
See, there you go.

23:15.627 --> 23:17.596
Wrongfully not understanding.

23:17.662 --> 23:18.997
{\an1}I'm gonna make sure you don't
trip on your way out.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.599
{\an1}Oh, you're so sweet,
thank you, I appreciate it.

23:20.665 --> 23:22.100
Ladies first.

23:28.640 --> 23:31.009
Tonight, Brandi's hosting
an MS charity event

23:31.076 --> 23:34.079
with her sister Amber,
and we all came to support.

23:34.146 --> 23:35.847
{\an8}I've been thinking
a lot about Brandi

23:35.914 --> 23:37.516
{\an8}trying to get revenge
on Moniece.

23:37.582 --> 23:39.851
And I get it, we suffered
a lot of trash-talking,

23:39.918 --> 23:41.653
and I want revenge too.

23:41.720 --> 23:44.222
But I can't deny,
my mama raised me right,

23:44.289 --> 23:46.725
and I know right from wrong,
and this is wrong.

23:48.226 --> 23:49.327
What up, though?

23:49.394 --> 23:51.263
What up, my (bleep)?

23:51.329 --> 23:53.532
{\an5}(Max)
After seeing how Ray
reacted to the tape,

23:53.598 --> 23:56.001
reality kicked in
that if this tape got out,

23:56.067 --> 23:58.637
it wouldn't only affect her,
but the people around her.

23:58.703 --> 24:01.540
And if something like that
was to happen to my son's mom,

24:01.606 --> 24:03.642
I wouldn't want someone
to use it against them.

24:03.708 --> 24:06.411
So, I decided on a new
plan of action.

24:06.478 --> 24:07.979
What's good,
what you been on?

24:08.046 --> 24:09.514
{\an8}Same ol', man, you know.

24:09.581 --> 24:12.417
{\an8}Just moved up
out this crib.

24:12.484 --> 24:13.852
{\an1}You know?

24:13.919 --> 24:15.921
Yeah, man, I wanted
to holler at you too, man.

24:15.987 --> 24:17.155
Let's go chop it up
somewhere else though.

24:17.222 --> 24:18.824
{\an1}Come on.
Let's get outta here.

24:18.890 --> 24:20.992
{\an5}(Max)
Fizz and I go back,
and I hate for our friendship

24:21.059 --> 24:24.162
and music to get affected
because our chicks are beefing.

24:24.229 --> 24:26.231
{\an1}I just wanted to holler
at you, my (bleep),

24:26.298 --> 24:28.266
{\an1}'cause you know, it's been
a whole lot of crazy...

24:28.333 --> 24:30.836
{\an6}Right.

24:28.333 --> 24:30.836
{\an1}Bull(bleep)
and you know.

24:30.902 --> 24:32.337
{\an1}B went over
to Moniece (bleep),

24:32.404 --> 24:34.105
{\an1}or whatever,
her album release,

24:34.172 --> 24:35.574
{\an1}and then she was on stage
with a mic

24:35.640 --> 24:36.775
talking 'bout her court case,

24:36.842 --> 24:38.577
{\an1}talking 'bout she lied
on her plea,

24:38.643 --> 24:41.446
{\an1}talking 'bout my son
and all sorts of extra (bleep).

24:41.513 --> 24:42.781
{\an6}Right.

24:41.513 --> 24:42.781
And it's like, you know,

24:42.848 --> 24:44.482
{\an1}I've been trying to play
the family card

24:44.549 --> 24:46.685
{\an1}and just be cool,
but it's just like,

24:46.751 --> 24:49.020
{\an1}the more I'm trying to be cool,
the more my peoples

24:49.087 --> 24:51.022
{\an4}feel like I don't
have they back.

24:49.087 --> 24:51.022
{\an3}Hmm.

24:51.089 --> 24:52.657
{\an5}(Fizz)
See, this is the (bleep)
I hate right here.

24:52.724 --> 24:54.826
Moniece brings
this type of drama to herself

24:54.893 --> 24:57.162
over and over
and over again.

24:57.229 --> 24:58.897
And it just gets
really frustrating,

24:58.964 --> 25:00.832
especially when it has to do
with my people.

25:00.899 --> 25:03.001
{\an1}So, I ain't even gonna lie,
at one point, I turned,

25:03.068 --> 25:05.670
{\an1}and I was just like,
you know, let's get revenge

25:05.737 --> 25:07.439
{\an1}and the whole nine,
but then I thought about it,

25:07.505 --> 25:08.840
and I'm like, (bleep),
I'm cool with your son,

25:08.907 --> 25:10.375
{\an1}I don't never want
that (bleep) to be like,

25:10.442 --> 25:11.943
{\an1}that's the (bleep)
who disrespected my mom

25:12.010 --> 25:13.311
or some (bleep) like that.

25:13.378 --> 25:15.714
{\an1}And it's like, I'mma just
let you know what's up.

25:15.780 --> 25:19.084
{\an1}Jason came to us with this
(bleep) bull(bleep) sex tape.

25:20.585 --> 25:22.354
{\an3}Pssh.

25:22.420 --> 25:24.589
I was already pissed off
with Moniece putting out there

25:24.656 --> 25:26.524
who she's had sex with
in the past,

25:26.591 --> 25:29.094
knowing that that would get
back to our son one day.

25:29.160 --> 25:30.629
Now, a sex tape?

25:30.695 --> 25:33.198
I know I need to dead this
before it gets out,

25:33.265 --> 25:35.133
but how many more
of Moniece's messes

25:35.200 --> 25:36.635
am I gonna have to clean up?

25:36.701 --> 25:39.437
So, where did
this tape come from?

25:39.504 --> 25:40.805
I'mma just keep it 100.

25:40.872 --> 25:42.641
Jason Lee got the tape.

25:42.707 --> 25:44.576
{\an1}If you need me to hit Jason up,
I'll hit Jason up.

25:44.643 --> 25:46.745
{\an5}I got Jason's number. Yep.

25:44.643 --> 25:46.745
{\an1}Okay.

25:46.811 --> 25:48.380
{\an1}I just wanted
to give you heads up.

25:48.446 --> 25:49.814
I realize it was too much,

25:49.881 --> 25:51.850
{\an4}and it just really
needed to stop.

25:49.881 --> 25:51.850
{\an3}Hm.

25:51.917 --> 25:54.286
{\an1}It's sad, it's embarrassing,
it's hurtful.

25:54.352 --> 25:56.288
I'm very apologetic, bro,

25:56.354 --> 25:58.423
and appreciative at
the same time, you know?

25:58.490 --> 25:59.958
We good, man.

25:58.490 --> 25:59.958
{\an3}We good.

26:00.025 --> 26:01.526
{\an1}My (bleep), good looking
on coming out, man.

26:01.593 --> 26:02.661
It's important.

26:01.593 --> 26:02.661
{\an3}Yes, sir.

26:02.727 --> 26:03.728
{\an1}(snapping)
Yes, sir.

26:04.963 --> 26:07.632
{\an7}I came here to just
ask you to just stop.

26:07.699 --> 26:09.868
{\an7}You know, the poking,
the poking, the poking.

26:09.935 --> 26:12.737

What did I do now?

27:08.593 --> 27:10.695
{\an1}I actually had
a conversation with Max.

27:10.762 --> 27:13.598
He was really hurt that you
got up on stage or something

27:13.665 --> 27:16.001
{\an4}and mentioned
something about...

27:13.665 --> 27:16.001
{\an3}Yeah.

27:16.067 --> 27:17.502
...his wife's court case.

And the whole thing is just
childish and very immature

27:20.405 --> 27:22.340
between the both of you.

27:22.407 --> 27:26.044
{\an1}I came here to just
ask you to just stop.

27:26.111 --> 27:28.880
{\an8}Do I feel bad for exposing
Brandi at my listening party?

27:28.947 --> 27:31.282
{\an8}Abso-(bleep)-lutely not.

27:31.349 --> 27:33.985
{\an1}What she did was attack me.
I fired back.

27:34.052 --> 27:35.553
I kept my hands
to myself.

27:35.620 --> 27:38.089
So, I figured
exposing her that way

27:38.156 --> 27:39.691
was the better alternative.

27:39.758 --> 27:43.461
{\an1}Well, that brings me
to another reason why I'm here.

27:43.528 --> 27:46.131
{\an1}You know, the poking,
the poking, the poking.

27:46.197 --> 27:48.099
{\an1}Eventually,
somebody gets poked back.

27:48.166 --> 27:51.236
{\an1}And Max was, you know,
cool enough

27:51.302 --> 27:52.971
to give me some information

27:53.038 --> 27:54.606
{\an1}that I felt I should
bring to you.

27:54.672 --> 27:55.907
Which is...?

27:55.974 --> 27:58.309
{\an1}Which is supposedly
there's a tape out here

27:58.376 --> 28:01.212
floating around
with you in it.

28:01.279 --> 28:03.615
A sex tape.

28:03.681 --> 28:09.320
{\an1}Jason Lee brought it to Max
and Brandi for ammo,

28:09.387 --> 28:10.588
and Max deaded it.

28:10.655 --> 28:12.223
(Moniece)
I can't say that I'm surprised

28:12.290 --> 28:14.592
that this little gutter rat
Brandi would stoop this low.

28:14.659 --> 28:17.162
After all, she loves
to get dirty.

28:17.228 --> 28:21.332
But I cannot figure out
what Jason Lee has against me.

28:21.399 --> 28:23.701
I've never done anything
to this man.

28:23.768 --> 28:26.838
Classic case of me
minding my (bleep) business,

28:26.905 --> 28:28.807
and then here comes
some bull(bleep).

28:28.873 --> 28:30.542
That's unfortunate that
people would like to play

28:30.608 --> 28:33.578
these kinds of games,
and this is exactly why

28:33.645 --> 28:35.880
I did what I did
at my listening party.

28:35.947 --> 28:37.949
Brandi's a mom.

28:38.016 --> 28:39.551
Now, if I found
some (bleep) like that,

28:39.617 --> 28:41.686
I wouldn't even tell anybody,
because that's just something

28:41.753 --> 28:45.557
{\an1}that you can't ever,
ever, ever, ever take back.

28:45.623 --> 28:48.526
Once it's out, it's out.

28:45.623 --> 28:48.526
{\an1}Yeah.

28:48.593 --> 28:50.528
I never wanna be that mom,

28:50.595 --> 28:52.630
and that's why I don't
do (bleep) like that.

28:52.697 --> 28:54.199
I have a healthy understanding

28:54.265 --> 28:55.600
that there are certain
boundaries

28:55.667 --> 28:56.935
that you just don't cross.

28:57.001 --> 28:59.537
If this tape ever got out,
I can't imagine

28:59.604 --> 29:02.807
how embarrassing
and devastating it would be

29:02.874 --> 29:04.342
for my son, and I would expect

29:04.409 --> 29:07.946
anyone with any type
of moral fiber

29:08.012 --> 29:10.849
to have a little respect
for at least that much.

29:10.915 --> 29:13.318
{\an1}When it comes to this,
it affects Kam,

29:13.384 --> 29:15.153
{\an1}and that's where
I have to step in.

29:15.220 --> 29:16.521
{\an1}I'm gonna go
holler at him.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.623
I know you're upset,

29:18.690 --> 29:20.892
{\an1}probably blood boiling
right now, but--

29:20.959 --> 29:23.795
My worry is that
if Jason isn't lying,

29:23.862 --> 29:25.930
I need to know
who's taped me.

29:25.997 --> 29:28.399
{\an1}As of right now,
nobody has anything

29:28.466 --> 29:30.768
other than Jason.

29:28.466 --> 29:30.768
{\an3}Jason.

29:30.835 --> 29:33.037

holler at him.

unh, all in,

30:09.974 --> 30:11.643
and rub on yourself.

30:09.974 --> 30:11.643
{\an1}Okay.

30:11.709 --> 30:14.179
The last thing a man
who's two weeks away

30:14.245 --> 30:17.482
from getting married needs
is some video ho

30:17.549 --> 30:19.484
rubbing her hands all over him.

30:19.551 --> 30:20.818
{\an1}All right,
you ready, Truth?

30:20.885 --> 30:22.654
{\an5}Ready, man.
Is she ready?

30:20.885 --> 30:22.654
Are you ready?

30:22.720 --> 30:23.988
{\an5}I am ready.

30:22.720 --> 30:23.988
That's the question.

30:24.055 --> 30:25.557
{\an1}We've been ready, 'cause
right now we need to know...

30:25.623 --> 30:26.758
Neither one of y'all
look ready.

30:26.824 --> 30:28.927
Can I speak to you, please?

30:28.993 --> 30:31.896
{\an1}Give me ten.
Matter of fact, 20.

30:34.065 --> 30:36.334
You're over here
grinding and doing--

30:36.401 --> 30:37.702
like, that's inappropriate.

30:37.769 --> 30:38.970
You wouldn't want
me doing it.

30:39.037 --> 30:40.738
{\an1}Baby.

30:39.037 --> 30:40.738
Your mom already said

30:40.805 --> 30:42.273
she didn't want us
to get married,

30:42.340 --> 30:44.542
{\an1}and then you got me up here
coming up to this?

30:44.609 --> 30:46.010
{\an1}Look--

30:44.609 --> 30:46.010
Do you wanna be married

30:46.077 --> 30:47.378
or do you wanna be
turned up?

30:49.814 --> 30:51.783
I know Princess is mad
because my mama said

30:51.849 --> 30:53.218
she didn't want us
to get married,

30:53.284 --> 30:55.653
but don't take that out on me.
That ain't fair.

30:55.720 --> 30:57.255
{\an8}If I was in the club,

30:57.322 --> 30:59.324
{\an8}or if I was out
doing something foul,

30:59.390 --> 31:01.859
then yeah, I get why
you getting upset.

31:01.926 --> 31:05.196
But I am shooting
a music video.

31:05.263 --> 31:07.332
I'm acting, okay?

31:07.398 --> 31:10.802
I've been doing this (bleep)
since I was 15.

31:10.868 --> 31:13.338
{\an1}You can't come up on my set
and tell me what to do

31:13.404 --> 31:15.340
{\an1}and point your finger,
when I'm in control,

31:15.406 --> 31:17.108
in front of people
I'm working with.

31:17.175 --> 31:18.810
It's embarrassing,
it's disrespectful,

31:18.876 --> 31:20.044
and it's not gonna happen.

31:20.111 --> 31:21.646
{\an1}You (bleep) with
my creativity.

31:21.713 --> 31:22.981
I feel like you're doing
this just to like,

31:23.047 --> 31:24.215
get it out your system.

31:24.282 --> 31:25.750
{\an5}You think I'm...

31:24.282 --> 31:25.750
Just so you can be like...

31:25.817 --> 31:27.118
{\an3}on a bitch.

31:27.185 --> 31:29.387
{\an4}Is that what
my work looks like?

31:27.185 --> 31:29.387
Yeah, it does.

31:29.454 --> 31:30.521
That is really wrong.

31:29.454 --> 31:30.521
{\an3}Yeah.

31:30.588 --> 31:32.924
Now, I ain't got
cold feet yet,

31:32.991 --> 31:35.193
but the (bleep)
that she attempting right now

31:35.260 --> 31:38.997
is making my mother(bleep) toes
very mother(bleep) cold.

31:39.063 --> 31:40.465
And after you got cold toes,

31:40.531 --> 31:42.400
it only leads down
to your feet.

31:42.467 --> 31:44.636
{\an1}This ain't no bull(bleep)
I'm doing.

31:44.702 --> 31:46.170
{\an1}Like, have some respect,
like...

31:46.237 --> 31:48.840
{\an5}Have some respect?

31:46.237 --> 31:48.840
Have some respect, yeah.

31:48.906 --> 31:50.174
So, you think I'm supposed
to just come up in here

31:50.241 --> 31:51.676
and not have an opinion?

31:51.743 --> 31:52.944
You want me to sit
in the corner

31:53.011 --> 31:54.279
like I'm some kind of mute?

31:54.345 --> 31:56.147
I have enough on my plate
with the wedding,

31:56.214 --> 31:58.082
and your mom's saying that she
doesn't want us to get married.

31:58.149 --> 31:59.484
So, since you can't
respect that,

31:59.550 --> 32:01.386
you wanna come up here,
disrespect me...

32:01.452 --> 32:03.588
{\an5}How am I disrespecting
you when you came here?

32:01.452 --> 32:03.588
...when I'm already
feeling bad.

32:03.655 --> 32:07.358
{\an1}This is my set.
This-- this where I'm at.

32:07.425 --> 32:10.194
I've been so stressed out
trying to plan this wedding.

32:10.261 --> 32:12.096
And now, it seems
like everything

32:12.163 --> 32:13.798
is falling apart
at the last minute.

32:13.865 --> 32:15.933
The last thing I needed
was for Ray's mom

32:16.000 --> 32:18.136
to come around
and give him second thoughts.

32:18.202 --> 32:20.938
And while he should
be comforting me right now,

32:21.005 --> 32:23.708
it seems like he's just
reverting back to his old ways.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.310
Have fun with
your free video

32:25.376 --> 32:27.211
and your ratchet-ass model.

32:27.278 --> 32:29.647
Guarantee you,
nobody's gonna watch it.

32:29.714 --> 32:31.316
{\an1}See, that's (bleep) up.
No belief.

32:31.382 --> 32:33.618
{\an1}Get a bitch badder than me,
then we'll talk.

32:36.020 --> 32:37.355
{\an8}You haven't been
answering your phone,

32:37.422 --> 32:38.489
{\an8}you didn't come home
last night.

32:37.422 --> 32:38.489
{\an5}I'm fine, I'm fine.

32:38.556 --> 32:39.824
{\an7}I didn't wanna
come home last night.

32:39.891 --> 32:42.260
{\an8}Does your mom have
anything to do with this?

32:42.327 --> 32:44.862
{\an7}I thought we had a bit more
respect for one another.

32:44.929 --> 32:46.998
{\an8}I have respect for you.

32:44.929 --> 32:46.998
{\an8}So, who got the tape?

32:58.109 --> 32:59.811
(door opening)

33:07.151 --> 33:08.986
{\an1}What you walking
in here like that for?

33:09.053 --> 33:10.922
{\an5}(Princess)
After I stormed out
of Ray's video shoot,

33:10.988 --> 33:13.958
I thought he just needed
to take a moment,

33:14.025 --> 33:17.528
clear his head, and eventually
come home and apologize.

33:17.595 --> 33:20.365
But instead,
he doesn't come home,

33:20.431 --> 33:22.133
doesn't call me,

33:22.200 --> 33:24.235
{\an8}and all this little
weird behavior

33:24.302 --> 33:26.904
{\an8}is just a little bit
too convenient

33:26.971 --> 33:29.173
days before the wedding.

33:29.240 --> 33:31.209
I'm just-- I just came
to check on you.

33:31.275 --> 33:32.744
You haven't been
answering your phone.

33:32.810 --> 33:33.878
{\an5}I'm fine, I'm fine.

33:32.810 --> 33:33.878
You didn't come
home last night.

33:33.945 --> 33:35.213
{\an1}I'm having a good time
up here actually.

33:35.279 --> 33:36.647
That's nice, I didn't
ask if you were having

33:36.714 --> 33:38.483
{\an1}a good time, but you didn't
come home last night.

33:38.549 --> 33:40.718
{\an4}I didn't wanna come
home last night.

33:38.549 --> 33:40.718
{\an3}Obviously.

33:40.785 --> 33:42.553
{\an1}You know, I'mma just
stay creative,

33:42.620 --> 33:43.955
like I'm not about this...

33:44.021 --> 33:45.790
And I would love that,
for you to stay creative.

33:45.857 --> 33:46.958
I'm not trying to stop
your creativity.

33:47.024 --> 33:48.092
{\an1}Whether you loved it
or you didn't,

33:48.159 --> 33:49.527
it's gonna happen anyway.

33:49.594 --> 33:51.896
I defended Princess
with my mom, I never do that.

33:51.963 --> 33:53.865
{\an8}And now, you wanna come
at me like this?

33:53.931 --> 33:56.300
{\an8}Maybe my mom had some truth
to what she was saying.

33:56.367 --> 34:00.438
I cannot sign up
for a lifetime of this.

34:00.505 --> 34:02.907
Dictating me on when, where
and how I can work,

34:02.974 --> 34:04.208
it ain't gonna happen.

34:04.275 --> 34:07.412
It will not, never,
I promise you that.

34:07.478 --> 34:10.415
{\an1}I mean, I'm just trying
to see where your head is at.

34:10.481 --> 34:12.283
Does your mom have
anything to do with this?

34:12.350 --> 34:14.351
Listen, I'm a grown-ass man.

34:14.418 --> 34:15.820
Oh, you are?

34:14.418 --> 34:15.820
{\an1}Yeah.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.522
{\an5}I didn't know that.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.522
{\an1}You wanna have
a smart-ass mouth

34:17.588 --> 34:20.425
{\an1}or do you wanna have
an intelligent conversation?

34:20.491 --> 34:22.393
{\an4}'Cause that's the problem,
is that mouth anyway,
it's like--

34:22.460 --> 34:25.029
{\an1}I mean, I'm grown too
and I can speak how I want.

34:25.096 --> 34:27.063
{\an1}You're confusing me.
What did you come here for?

34:27.130 --> 34:28.632
{\an3}Okay.

34:28.699 --> 34:31.569
This Ray that I've been
dealing with the past few days

34:31.636 --> 34:35.373
is not the Ray that I want
to get married to.

34:35.440 --> 34:38.309
I'm having flashbacks right now
of who he used to be

34:38.376 --> 34:39.643
and what he put me through.

34:39.710 --> 34:41.411
You have an attitude
and I don't like it.

34:41.478 --> 34:43.447
Anything else?

34:41.478 --> 34:43.447
Be yourself.

34:43.514 --> 34:45.248
Be yourself.

34:45.315 --> 34:47.885
{\an1}I'm about to be
in a minute.

34:49.554 --> 34:51.489
(chuckling)

34:59.630 --> 35:02.133
{\an5}(Jason)
I got papers from
Moniece's attorney this morning,

35:02.200 --> 35:04.001
{\an8}so it's no surprise
that I'm being summoned

35:04.068 --> 35:06.204
{\an8}to a meeting with her
baby daddy, Lil' Fizz.

35:06.270 --> 35:08.272
{\an8}I may not have a lot
of respect for Moniece,

35:08.339 --> 35:09.707
{\an8}but Fizz and I
have always been cool,

35:09.774 --> 35:11.409
{\an8}so I wasn't gonna
turn him down.

35:11.476 --> 35:13.678
Out of respect for him,
I wanted the opportunity

35:13.744 --> 35:15.513
to explain that I'm just
the messenger,

35:15.580 --> 35:18.683
and I'm not personally trying
to get Moniece's tape out.

35:18.749 --> 35:20.351
What's going on?

35:20.418 --> 35:21.719
I wanted to holler
at you, man,

35:21.786 --> 35:23.521
because you seem to be
doing a lot of talking,

35:23.588 --> 35:25.323
and you know,
I thought we had

35:25.389 --> 35:27.258
a bit more respect
for one another.

35:27.325 --> 35:28.826
{\an1}I have respect for you,
just so it's--

35:28.893 --> 35:30.995
{\an1}that's coming from me to you,
and because of that,

35:31.062 --> 35:32.497
I do show a lot
of consideration

35:32.563 --> 35:34.599
{\an1}to how I do address
the things that Moniece does.

35:34.665 --> 35:36.467
If I didn't have respect,

35:36.534 --> 35:39.170
{\an1}the way that I could have used
my platform to exploit her,

35:39.237 --> 35:40.805
{\an1}I would have already
done that, but I haven't.

35:40.872 --> 35:42.173
Right now, that's exactly
what you're doing.

35:42.240 --> 35:44.809
{\an1}Okay.

35:42.240 --> 35:44.809
This now has become

35:44.876 --> 35:46.577
very detrimental.

35:44.876 --> 35:46.577
{\an1}Okay.

35:46.644 --> 35:48.079
Because there is
a child involved,

35:48.145 --> 35:49.313
which is my son.

35:49.380 --> 35:51.115
This tape (bleep)...

35:49.380 --> 35:51.115
{\an1}Sure.

35:51.182 --> 35:52.817
I need this (bleep)
to be deaded.

35:52.884 --> 35:54.585
First of all, I don't have
the tape in my possession,

35:54.652 --> 35:55.987
{\an5}I have access to the tape.

35:54.652 --> 35:55.987
{\an3}Okay.

35:56.053 --> 35:57.522
{\an1}So, let's clear that up.
Second of all,

35:57.588 --> 35:58.723
{\an1}I didn't give it
to Brandi,

35:58.789 --> 35:59.857
{\an1}I haven't
released it to anybody,

35:59.924 --> 36:01.125
{\an1}and I don't intend
to put it out.

36:01.192 --> 36:03.728
{\an1}But what I wanted it to do
is having the effect

36:03.794 --> 36:05.997
{\an1}that it apparently is having,
is to get a message across

36:06.063 --> 36:08.733
{\an1}to Moniece, who tries to
throw rocks and hide her hand.

36:08.799 --> 36:11.369
{\an1}Don't act like a (bleep) victim
after you attack everybody.

36:11.435 --> 36:13.371
I can give a (bleep)
about all of that, bro.

36:13.437 --> 36:15.239
Who got the tape?

36:15.306 --> 36:17.074
Well, that's between
that person and her.

36:17.141 --> 36:19.210
She know who got it.

36:19.277 --> 36:21.279
I appreciate Drew
for finally having my back

36:21.345 --> 36:22.547
when (bleep) hit the fan.

36:22.613 --> 36:24.382
But I'm not the type
to let anybody else

36:24.448 --> 36:26.284
fight my battles.

36:26.350 --> 36:27.718
So, let's ask her.

36:29.053 --> 36:30.321
Welcome to the party.

36:34.091 --> 36:36.394
{\an7}Me and all my writers
pull receipts on everybody.

36:36.460 --> 36:38.863
{\an7}You, everybody.
That's just what we do.

36:38.930 --> 36:40.798
{\an7}I release 'em when it's time
to release 'em.

36:47.705 --> 36:49.473
{\an5}(Fizz)
I can give a (bleep)
about all of that, bro.

36:49.540 --> 36:50.608
Who got the tape?

36:50.675 --> 36:52.510
Well, that's between
that person and her.

36:52.577 --> 36:54.478
She know who got it.

36:54.545 --> 36:56.614
So, let's ask her.

36:57.882 --> 36:59.250
Welcome to the party.

36:59.317 --> 37:01.152
Thank you for having me.

37:01.218 --> 37:03.454
So, I'm taking this alleged tape
very seriously,

37:03.521 --> 37:05.389
and I've already had
my attorney begin to reach out

37:05.456 --> 37:07.358
and take legal action
against all parties

37:07.425 --> 37:09.894
that I know
to be involved thus far,

37:09.961 --> 37:11.662
one of those people
being Jason.

37:11.729 --> 37:13.497
But I definitely
wanted to see him

37:13.564 --> 37:15.266
and speak to him for myself.

37:15.333 --> 37:16.701
{\an8}I need to know
who this creep is

37:16.767 --> 37:18.169
{\an8}that passed this tape on to him.

37:18.235 --> 37:20.304
So, it was brought
to my attention

37:20.371 --> 37:21.372
that you have a tape.

37:21.439 --> 37:24.442
I came to ask
for the tape.

37:24.508 --> 37:26.644
{\an5}I don't have the tape.

37:24.508 --> 37:26.644
Who has the tape?

37:26.711 --> 37:28.512
{\an1}The person that is in
the tape with you.

37:28.579 --> 37:29.914
You should know
who the guy is.

37:29.981 --> 37:31.682
{\an1}I mean, he's in
the tape with you.

37:31.749 --> 37:35.119
It seems that you don't
want to reveal the name.

37:35.186 --> 37:37.355
Someone handed it to you
without my consent.

37:37.421 --> 37:39.357
It's my understanding
that that is illegal

37:39.423 --> 37:41.859
for you to take
and for them to give,

37:41.926 --> 37:43.961
and for Brandi
to solicit.

37:44.028 --> 37:45.463
Let me say this.

37:45.529 --> 37:48.132
{\an1}I just, driving here,
got an email

37:48.199 --> 37:49.567
{\an1}from your attorneys
speaking on your behalf

37:49.634 --> 37:51.002
{\an1}with all these
veiled threats...

37:51.068 --> 37:52.770
{\an6}Mm-hmm.

37:51.068 --> 37:52.770
{\an1}...and all painting
this picture

37:52.837 --> 37:56.574
{\an1}that I am trying
to exploit you and extort you.

37:56.641 --> 37:58.843
And let me just say,
there ain't no crime,

37:58.909 --> 38:00.778
{\an1}and I have
a First Amendment right.

38:00.845 --> 38:03.280
{\an1}It is what it is, but we'll let
the attorneys deal with that.

38:03.347 --> 38:06.250
Moniece wants to intimidate me
by getting lawyers involved,

38:06.317 --> 38:08.386
but I know my rights,
I've done nothing wrong.

38:08.452 --> 38:10.187
I could spin this
whole situation

38:10.254 --> 38:11.822
and point the finger
at Brandi and Princess.

38:11.889 --> 38:13.057
I mean, they are the reason

38:13.124 --> 38:14.659
why I got involved
in the first place.

38:14.725 --> 38:17.728
And now, I'm the one
facing legal repercussions.

38:17.795 --> 38:20.331
But I'm not gonna do that,
because I was actually happy

38:20.398 --> 38:21.732
to bring Moniece
down a notch.

38:21.799 --> 38:24.702
{\an1}If I have to go through you
to get to the tape,

38:24.769 --> 38:26.470
that's the ultimate goal.

38:26.537 --> 38:30.107
For me, it was nothing more
than dealing with the person

38:30.174 --> 38:32.743
who violated my privacy.

38:32.810 --> 38:35.046
This is the thing I don't like
about the girls in Hollywood.

38:35.112 --> 38:36.781
{\an1}You all do
all kinds of (bleep).

38:36.847 --> 38:38.449
{\an1}I find out about it,
do my job,

38:38.516 --> 38:41.252
{\an1}then I become the messy guy,
the bad guy, the big bad wolf,

38:41.318 --> 38:42.820
when I'm doing my job.

38:42.887 --> 38:44.722
(Fizz)
Moniece has her faults,

38:44.789 --> 38:46.624
but Jason is wrong
as a mother(bleep).

38:46.691 --> 38:47.892
What's your angle, bruh?

38:47.958 --> 38:50.094
Like, are you really
just that messy?

38:50.161 --> 38:51.829
You don't feel something
to that nature

38:51.896 --> 38:54.598
through this so-called
line of respect that we have

38:54.665 --> 38:56.067
for one another that you
shouldn't have reached out

38:56.133 --> 38:57.768
{\an5}to me first about that?

38:56.133 --> 38:57.768
Well, Fizz, listen.

38:57.835 --> 38:59.970
Letting people know,
like Brandi,

39:00.037 --> 39:01.906
{\an5}that there's sex tape
floating around...

39:00.037 --> 39:01.906
{\an1}Uh-huh?

39:01.972 --> 39:03.774
and you not calling me about it?

39:03.841 --> 39:06.110
{\an4}Yeah?

39:03.841 --> 39:06.110
Is obviously exploiting
some bull(bleep).

39:06.177 --> 39:07.778
{\an4}Okay.

39:06.177 --> 39:07.778
So, I'm sitting here today

39:07.845 --> 39:09.880
asking you what's the beef
with you and Moniece, bro?

39:09.947 --> 39:11.782
{\an5}Because right now...

39:09.947 --> 39:11.782
So, to go that way--

39:11.849 --> 39:13.417
{\an5}...you going in a little bit
too deep, bro.

39:11.849 --> 39:13.417
We're gonna have a conversation

39:13.484 --> 39:14.985
{\an5}but I'm not going
to argue with you.

39:13.484 --> 39:14.985
You going in a little bit

39:15.052 --> 39:16.454
{\an5}too deep right now

39:15.052 --> 39:16.454
{\an1}I'm not gonna yell
back and forth.

39:16.520 --> 39:17.755
{\an4}If you wanna talk,
let's talk.

39:16.520 --> 39:17.755
with this whole thing.

39:17.822 --> 39:19.890
{\an1}Me and all my writers
pull receipts on everybody.

39:19.957 --> 39:22.393
{\an1}You, everybody.
That's just what we do.

39:22.460 --> 39:23.861
{\an1}I release 'em when it's time
to release 'em.

39:23.928 --> 39:25.396
You're doing this
for your blog.

39:25.463 --> 39:27.698
{\an1}No, I'm doing this
to send a very clear message.

39:27.765 --> 39:29.333
{\an1}You need to start
taking responsibility

39:29.400 --> 39:30.534
for the things
you say and do,

39:30.601 --> 39:32.236
and don't act like
a (bleep) victim.

39:32.303 --> 39:34.705
{\an1}You throw a rock, you gonna
get a rock thrown at you.

39:34.772 --> 39:37.508
I do not consent
to the dissemination

39:37.575 --> 39:40.177
{\an1}of this tape, and I will have
my attorney reach out,

39:40.244 --> 39:42.146
and that's how
I'll get the name.

39:45.783 --> 39:47.985
{\an5}Who's on the tape, bruh?

39:45.783 --> 39:47.985
{\an1}She know.

39:48.052 --> 39:49.320
{\an1}I mean--

39:48.052 --> 39:49.320
What does he do?

39:49.386 --> 39:51.655
{\an5}He's a rapper.

39:49.386 --> 39:51.655
A known rapper?

39:57.461 --> 40:00.264
{\an8}Next time on
"Love and Hip Hop: Hollywood"...

40:00.331 --> 40:02.166
{\an8}I already went through
a tragedy in my life,

40:02.233 --> 40:04.135
{\an8}and I don't wanna see
nothing happen to her.

40:04.201 --> 40:06.670
{\an7}I'm gonna have to go
and turn myself in tomorrow.

40:06.737 --> 40:07.738
{\an8}For (bleep)?

40:07.805 --> 40:09.340
{\an7}Yes, girl,
from last year.

40:09.406 --> 40:10.708
{\an7}I'm telling y'all,
in an instant,

40:10.775 --> 40:13.210
{\an7}your life can
(bleep) change.

40:13.277 --> 40:15.613
{\an7}So, I understand we're here
because you think

40:15.679 --> 40:17.381
{\an7}you may want or need
a premarital agreement.

40:17.448 --> 40:19.350
{\an8}Yes, absolutely.

40:19.416 --> 40:21.552
{\an7}She's actually gonna go
get a prenup.

40:21.619 --> 40:23.954
{\an7}You don't think
I'm gonna come across

40:24.021 --> 40:26.757
{\an8}disloyal to the Norwoods
if I don't say anything?

40:26.824 --> 40:28.826
{\an8}You acting like
you gotta do this.

40:28.893 --> 40:30.861
{\an8}You don't have to do nothing.

40:30.928 --> 40:33.898
{\an8}You know A1 stole
my mom's car.

40:33.964 --> 40:36.400
{\an7}She told me that she's gonna
give me the car back.

40:36.467 --> 40:38.536
{\an7}And I was thinking maybe,
like, you could ride with me

40:38.602 --> 40:41.605
{\an8}to go do the trade-off
for the car.

40:41.672 --> 40:43.274
{\an8}What the (bleep)?

40:43.340 --> 40:46.277
{\an8}What the (bleep) are you
doing in my car, Pam?

40:46.343 --> 40:47.311
{\an9}Pam, get--

40:46.343 --> 40:47.311
{\an7}Mom!

40:47.378 --> 40:48.846
{\an8}Bitch, get out of my car!

40:48.913 --> 40:51.048
{\an7}I want the only copies
of the tape that you have.

40:51.115 --> 40:53.150
{\an8}There's only one copy
'cause it's in a phone.

40:51.115 --> 40:53.150
{\an5}Okay, well then, I need it.

40:53.217 --> 40:54.151
{\an8}You can send it
to my attorney.

40:54.218 --> 40:55.653
{\an8}Attorney for what?

40:55.719 --> 40:57.588
{\an7}You're the only person
with the tape!

40:57.655 --> 41:00.591
{\an8}I want every copy you have.

40:57.655 --> 41:00.591
{\an8}There's only one co--
