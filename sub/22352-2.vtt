WEBVTT

00:15.181 --> 00:17.559
[horn honks]

00:21.646 --> 00:24.441
I should have stuck to my guns
and ordered you a decaf.

00:24.524 --> 00:25.358
Luke.

00:25.442 --> 00:27.110
Listen, a pregnant woman should not have

00:27.193 --> 00:29.821
more than 300 milligrams of caffeine
in a day.

00:29.904 --> 00:32.240
-I read it on the internet.
-You read it on the internet.

00:32.323 --> 00:33.616
Yeah, that's how I know it's true.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.243
[laughs]

00:35.326 --> 00:38.538
You know, you are ridiculous,

00:38.621 --> 00:44.002
and ridiculously sweet,
and cute, and...

00:45.670 --> 00:46.504
What?

00:48.882 --> 00:50.341
I don't deserve you.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.136
Hey.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.056
I'm the luckiest man I know.

01:04.522 --> 01:05.356
[Andi] Susan?

01:08.818 --> 01:11.029
Andi, hi.

01:11.112 --> 01:14.532
I'm sorry to interrupt.
That was the sweetest thing.

01:14.616 --> 01:16.576
[chuckles]

01:17.160 --> 01:18.620
I'm Luke, Susan's husband.

01:18.703 --> 01:22.707
-Hi. Andi. I'm--
-Andi's an old friend.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.626
Cool. How do you guys know each other?

01:26.252 --> 01:28.713
Camp.
We were camp counselors.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.757
You didn't tell me
you were a camp counselor.

01:32.467 --> 01:33.426
Yeah.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.386
I wonder what else she's keeping from me.

01:35.470 --> 01:36.554
[Susan] Um...

01:36.638 --> 01:40.016
Listen, Andi, I'd love to catch up,
but we're actually just heading to brunch.

01:40.099 --> 01:41.810
Yeah, of course. No problem.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.020
You know what? I could actually...

01:44.103 --> 01:47.023
Go ahead and hold our spot
if you wanted to catch up.

01:48.066 --> 01:50.401
Sure. Thank you.

01:50.485 --> 01:52.737
-It was nice meeting you, Andi.
-Likewise.

02:00.745 --> 02:02.747
Wow, I--

02:02.831 --> 02:05.750
Can't believe you're pregnant.
Congratulations.

02:09.295 --> 02:12.423
Look, Susan, I saw you.
I just wanted to say hello.

02:12.507 --> 02:14.968
Well, do me a favor
and next time you see me,

02:15.051 --> 02:16.553
just keep walking.

02:16.636 --> 02:21.933
I wasn't going to say anything about...
what happened. I'm not an idiot.

02:22.016 --> 02:24.102
Well, I don't know
what you're gonna say.

02:24.185 --> 02:25.770
Look, what you do
and don't tell your husband,

02:25.854 --> 02:27.522
that's none of my business.

02:27.605 --> 02:28.857
You don't think he noticed
something there?

02:28.940 --> 02:31.109
Andi, listen.

02:31.192 --> 02:36.364
I will defend my family... with my life.

02:36.447 --> 02:38.408
Do you understand?

02:45.874 --> 02:48.001
Holy. Holy fucking hell.

02:50.044 --> 02:51.880
[Susan] Fuck! Fuck!

02:53.548 --> 02:55.383
Don't touch it!

02:55.466 --> 02:57.552
Who could know?
Nobody knows. It's been years.

02:57.635 --> 02:59.637
[Dawn] Well, obviously,
somebody fucking does!

02:59.721 --> 03:01.514
Fuck. Fuck.

03:05.810 --> 03:07.729
[sobs]

03:11.941 --> 03:13.443
[Peter] Come on, get up.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.361
Susan, listen to me.

03:16.696 --> 03:19.741
Look at me. Susan, look at me!

03:19.824 --> 03:22.076
Come here. Come on, come on.

03:22.160 --> 03:22.994
Shh.

03:23.077 --> 03:24.996
Breathe, breathe, breathe,
breathe, breathe.

03:25.914 --> 03:26.748
Breathe.

03:27.957 --> 03:28.791
Breathe.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.379
There you go. Good.

03:33.463 --> 03:34.547
We're gonna be okay.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.217
We're gonna figure this out.

03:38.843 --> 03:39.677
Come on.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.446
We're gonna get through this.

03:58.529 --> 03:59.364
Are we?

04:23.805 --> 04:26.182
We shouldn't be here with a psychopath
out in these woods.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.850
Renee, stop, please.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.144
Did you hear something?

04:33.481 --> 04:35.108
-No, did you?
-Listen.

04:38.569 --> 04:40.446
I don't hear anything.

04:40.530 --> 04:41.823
-[shouts] Gene!
-Shh!

04:43.908 --> 04:46.119
Nobody's here. Come on.
Let's move.

04:47.453 --> 04:48.913
[loud cracking]

04:51.749 --> 04:53.751
It's okay.

04:53.835 --> 04:54.794
We're okay.

05:03.886 --> 05:04.929
[whispers] Antoine.

05:08.599 --> 05:09.767
What the hell is that?

05:11.436 --> 05:12.770
Jesus Christ.

05:14.897 --> 05:17.066
No, no, please, please!
No, no, please.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.860
[sobbing]

05:21.487 --> 05:22.322
Please.

05:28.494 --> 05:29.829
It's him.

05:29.912 --> 05:32.040
[panting]

05:54.896 --> 05:56.355
[Noah] Almost done.

05:56.439 --> 05:57.523
[Peter] Yeah, I think so.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.365
You got blood on your hands.

06:12.497 --> 06:13.748
And this...

06:15.625 --> 06:17.502
...is your lifeline.

06:17.585 --> 06:20.588
Unless it says I'm gonna live
to a hundred, I don't want to hear it.

06:20.671 --> 06:24.967
It's not about how long you live.
It's about the quality of life you have.

06:26.803 --> 06:32.475
See, a deep and long lifeline
means that you're full of vitality,

06:34.352 --> 06:36.145
and that people are attracted to you.

06:41.984 --> 06:44.070
Or it means my moisturizer sucks.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.991
Can we please just finish setting up?

06:49.075 --> 06:51.786
Yeah. Um, I have this sign here.

06:51.869 --> 06:54.997
Where do you think it should go,
back here or in the front?

06:55.081 --> 06:56.541
Doesn't matter.

06:56.624 --> 06:58.960
I think it should go in the front.

06:59.043 --> 07:00.461
Oh, and I got this snow globe

07:00.545 --> 07:02.171
that I thought we could use
as a crystal ball.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.631
What do you think?

07:03.714 --> 07:05.883
-Great.
-Okay, cool.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.802
I'm gonna go get it, but...

07:07.885 --> 07:10.471
Susan, I'm really excited
that we're doing this together.

07:12.014 --> 07:13.182
Okay, I'll be right back.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.277
Hey.

07:25.319 --> 07:27.738
[sighs] Save me.

07:27.822 --> 07:29.740
From what? This looks amazing.

07:29.824 --> 07:33.077
No, not this. From Talvinder.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.787
Oh, my God, Susan.

07:34.871 --> 07:38.875
Okay, I know. I get it.
You guys all love Tal.

07:38.958 --> 07:43.463
Come on. She is like so desperate
and clingy, it's disgusting.

07:43.546 --> 07:47.133
Maybe she's overcompensating
because she can sense that you hate her.

07:47.216 --> 07:50.511
What can I say?
The girl creeps me out.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.889
And now I get to spend all night
reading fortunes

07:52.972 --> 07:56.434
and staring into some stupid crystal ball
that she's been off looking for

07:56.517 --> 07:58.311
-for the past hour!
-Shh, shh.

07:58.394 --> 07:59.854
-Jesus, Susan.
-What?

07:59.937 --> 08:03.441
You could be nicer to her, okay?
You could. You could try.

08:05.693 --> 08:10.907
Okay, you know I can read people.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.242
Okay, I don't need tarot cards
or crystal balls.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.870
My gut is telling me
do not trust that girl.

08:16.621 --> 08:19.290
[scoffs] What the fuck do I know, right?

08:19.874 --> 08:22.502
Because Tal's just so nice,
and friendly, and amazing.

08:25.546 --> 08:26.380
All right.

08:28.132 --> 08:29.217
I must be wrong then.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.845
Except I never am.

08:32.929 --> 08:33.763
You know that.

08:43.314 --> 08:45.566
[Noah] What do you think the culties
are doing right now?

08:45.650 --> 08:47.151
[Dawn] Talking about us.

08:47.235 --> 08:49.570
Do you think they think we did it?

08:49.654 --> 08:51.948
-[Dawn] Why would we kill our friend?
-Wouldn't be the first time.

08:52.031 --> 08:54.116
Are you trying to help
or are you going to be an asshole?

08:54.200 --> 08:56.118
-Fuck off, Dawn.
-You fuck off, Noah.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.745
Guys, come on! Stop!

09:00.081 --> 09:01.666
Fuck off.

09:04.794 --> 09:05.670
We need a story.

09:09.257 --> 09:12.552
We need... to get unified

09:14.512 --> 09:16.389
in case they accuse us of anything.

09:18.975 --> 09:22.728
-Something simple.
-Okay, we attack first.

09:22.812 --> 09:23.813
[Peter] Okay, how?

09:25.356 --> 09:27.275
Well, we're guests here, right?

09:27.358 --> 09:30.111
We come here for a reunion
and this is what happened?

09:30.194 --> 09:32.863
Our friend's been murdered.
We're traumatized.

09:32.947 --> 09:37.368
It's like Talvinder all over again,
and we put them on the defensive.

09:37.451 --> 09:40.538
It tracks with everything
we've said so far.

09:40.621 --> 09:42.957
I know, but I mean...

09:43.040 --> 09:45.585
I don't think we should mention Talvinder
unless we have to.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.128
It just sounds like we're trying too hard.

09:47.211 --> 09:48.629
Fine, then we won't.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.965
Otherwise, I think it sounds good.

09:51.048 --> 09:55.303
Let's go see if they found Gene
and get the fuck out of here.

10:05.187 --> 10:06.856
[knocking]

10:09.567 --> 10:11.402
I just wanted to see
how you were holding up.

10:13.070 --> 10:15.448
I'm as well as I can be.

10:15.531 --> 10:17.074
[soft clattering]

10:22.663 --> 10:24.790
You're into crystals?

10:24.874 --> 10:27.001
I know, it's a little hocus pocus.

10:29.670 --> 10:31.422
That's cool.

10:31.505 --> 10:33.299
There's more things in heaven and earth.

10:33.382 --> 10:35.134
Than can be dreamt of in your philosophy.

10:37.678 --> 10:38.512
Yeah.

10:40.890 --> 10:41.807
What are those ones?

10:43.559 --> 10:44.393
Carnelian.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.023
Smoky quartz.

10:50.858 --> 10:53.527
Sardonyx for protection.

10:55.112 --> 10:59.325
I hold onto them because they help
create a circle of support.

11:00.576 --> 11:01.577
You're feeling scared.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.416
You?

11:07.500 --> 11:12.546
There's so much terror in the field.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.801
I'm fighting hard to stay present.

11:32.316 --> 11:33.150
What's that?

11:34.443 --> 11:35.403
Black tourmaline...

11:37.279 --> 11:40.991
will envelope you in protective energy
and help you stay grounded.

11:42.868 --> 11:43.702
Thank you.

11:47.748 --> 11:50.584
Judith? Um...

12:01.262 --> 12:02.096
What?

12:04.473 --> 12:06.934
I don't mean to pry into your business...

12:09.520 --> 12:11.522
but do we have to be worried about you?

12:15.443 --> 12:16.277
No.

12:16.360 --> 12:19.071
-You're not doing anything.
-No. No. No.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.239
[knocking]

12:21.949 --> 12:25.494
Hey, I'm calling a pow-wow.

12:26.495 --> 12:29.498
-You all right, Antoine? You--
-You look shaken up.

12:29.582 --> 12:30.499
Downstairs in five.

12:37.798 --> 12:39.300
[Antoine] As you all know,

12:40.551 --> 12:42.136
earlier today...

12:43.637 --> 12:47.224
one of our guests,
Andi, was found dead.

12:48.184 --> 12:52.104
And Renee and I went to find Gene
to call for help.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.106
We found that he had been killed as well.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.441
Killed?

12:57.067 --> 12:58.819
Andi and Gene were both murdered.

12:58.903 --> 13:00.529
Wait, how do you know they were murdered?

13:00.613 --> 13:01.989
This is so fucked up.

13:02.072 --> 13:05.201
My friends, my friends, please,
we have to remain calm

13:05.284 --> 13:07.411
so that we can figure this out together.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.163
-Together we are stronger.
-No, no, no.

13:09.246 --> 13:13.083
This is not the time for your "Kumbaya"
circle jerk bullshit, all right?

13:13.167 --> 13:14.293
We need to find out who did this.

13:14.376 --> 13:16.212
Both groups lost someone.

13:16.295 --> 13:17.671
I'm giving you a fact right now.

13:17.755 --> 13:20.633
The bodies didn't start dropping
until these assholes showed up.

13:20.716 --> 13:22.843
Oh, nice, yeah. Blame the victim.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.515
We came here for a reunion, okay?

13:27.598 --> 13:31.393
Our friend was brutally murdered
and now you're accusing us? It's not--

13:31.477 --> 13:32.937
Nobody's accusing you of anything.

13:33.020 --> 13:35.314
You lost your friend,

13:35.397 --> 13:36.774
-and we lost ours.
-Right.

13:36.857 --> 13:41.862
If we can get two on a sled,
we can carry half of us over to Gene's,

13:41.946 --> 13:43.113
use the phone and call for help.

13:43.197 --> 13:46.408
Yeah, and who are the lucky fucks
who get to stay behind?

13:46.992 --> 13:49.411
[Renee] The main priority here is safety.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.789
We have three snow mobiles
and we're going to be boondocking it,

13:51.872 --> 13:54.041
so we've got to keep it light...
[voice fades away]

13:56.168 --> 13:57.878
Oh, my God, you don't think
it was one of us, do you?

13:57.962 --> 13:59.588
I'm not a fucking detective, Renee!

13:59.672 --> 14:01.215
For fuck's sakes!

14:01.298 --> 14:04.343
Sorry.
Sorry, that was very reactive of me.

14:04.426 --> 14:05.594
Yeah, you're goddamn right it was.

14:05.678 --> 14:09.223
I'm trying to hold space for you,
but it's a lot to process.

14:09.306 --> 14:11.392
Can we just have silence, please?

14:12.768 --> 14:14.687
No problem.

14:21.569 --> 14:22.444
You check that one.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.532
[engine sputters]

14:26.615 --> 14:28.868
Fuck, it's not working.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.035
This one is down too.

14:31.453 --> 14:32.288
Let me try.

14:33.497 --> 14:34.331
[grunts]

14:38.002 --> 14:39.044
Fuck.

14:40.170 --> 14:42.464
There's no gas. It's empty.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.466
-This one is too.
-Shit.

14:44.550 --> 14:45.801
Siphoned it out.

14:54.977 --> 14:57.563
Susan, no one has volunteered
to stay behind,

14:57.646 --> 14:58.939
so we'll be drawing straws.

15:02.693 --> 15:03.527
Susan?

15:06.030 --> 15:06.864
Sorry.

15:08.282 --> 15:09.283
I was a million miles away.

15:11.327 --> 15:12.703
Anything I can do?

15:12.786 --> 15:14.997
You got a time machine?

15:15.080 --> 15:18.959
I just want to go back
before any of this happened,

15:20.628 --> 15:22.421
before we ever decided to come here

15:24.423 --> 15:25.841
and do everything.

15:27.134 --> 15:28.052
That's what I want.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.266
I want to spend the rest of my life
with good people.

15:35.893 --> 15:38.020
Stay away from the bad ones.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.438
The bad ones?

15:39.521 --> 15:40.356
Yeah.

15:42.107 --> 15:42.942
They're everywhere.

15:46.737 --> 15:51.867
[Talvinder] The kids will be here
any minute. Let's do our final touches.

16:01.919 --> 16:04.672
I have an idea.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.882
I think we should do
something with our hair,

16:06.966 --> 16:08.550
something kind of witchy.

16:08.634 --> 16:11.303
Oh, come on. If you don't like it,
we can always take it out.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.307
-Okay.
-Really? Okay.

16:15.391 --> 16:18.644
-Sit down. Come on!
-Okay.

16:18.727 --> 16:20.270
-[giggles]
-Okay.

16:23.774 --> 16:25.275
Your hair is really nice.

16:26.694 --> 16:27.528
Thanks.

16:29.071 --> 16:30.364
I love doing hair.

16:30.447 --> 16:33.200
When I was a little girl, I used to play
with my dolls' hair all the time.

16:33.283 --> 16:34.743
I find it so relaxing.

16:37.454 --> 16:43.502
So I was thinking we could do your hair
split in the front.

16:46.797 --> 16:52.469
And maybe a couple of braids
in front of your face.

16:54.722 --> 16:55.556
Or...

16:58.517 --> 17:00.310
we could sweep it all to one side.

17:07.526 --> 17:10.404
Your skin's really soft.

17:10.487 --> 17:11.655
It feels amazing.

17:15.909 --> 17:17.911
Makes me wanna...

17:17.995 --> 17:19.455
Makes you wanna what?

17:35.179 --> 17:36.555
It makes me wanna...

17:39.475 --> 17:42.728
Tell you how pathetic you are.

17:43.812 --> 17:45.272
I see right through you,

17:46.690 --> 17:48.358
even if the others don't.

18:10.589 --> 18:14.384
We all have the capacity
to do both evil and good.

18:14.468 --> 18:17.054
Now, if you told me that you didn't want
to hang around with murderers anymore,

18:17.137 --> 18:20.224
I'd say yeah, you probably shouldn't
be hanging around with murderers.

18:20.307 --> 18:22.893
But you said you wanted to get away
from the bad people.

18:24.770 --> 18:29.399
And that's impossible because you,
like me and everyone else,

18:30.776 --> 18:32.736
you have both of those things in you.

18:43.288 --> 18:44.581
[Peter] We're stuck here for the night.

18:48.335 --> 18:50.629
You guys are sure you checked
every snowmobile?

18:51.213 --> 18:52.297
What do you think, Noah?

18:55.384 --> 18:58.178
Look, we'll head out to Gene's
in the morning on foot.

18:59.555 --> 19:00.973
For now, let's try to get some sleep.

19:01.056 --> 19:04.143
How could you think about sleep
when we're being stalked?

19:04.226 --> 19:06.270
We'll keep watch. We'll take shifts.

19:06.353 --> 19:09.565
-We have no protection.
-Yes, we do.

19:09.648 --> 19:11.817
-Dawn!
-What the fuck?

19:11.900 --> 19:14.444
What? I brought it, just in case.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.029
In case of what?

19:16.113 --> 19:19.741
I don't know. A psycho killer stalking us,
Talvinder's ghost out to get revenge,

19:19.825 --> 19:20.909
rabid coyotes.

19:20.993 --> 19:26.039
Do you have any idea what happens to you,
to us if they find out you have a weapon?

19:26.123 --> 19:28.167
If someone comes in here, I'll shoot them.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.209
In your sleep?

19:29.293 --> 19:30.460
Yeah, in my sleep, Susan.

19:30.544 --> 19:32.838
No one's coming in here because
we're barricading the fucking door.

19:35.883 --> 19:37.092
-Yo, what's that?
-What?

19:40.012 --> 19:42.347
Chill. It's not like a guy
with a machete or anything.

19:42.431 --> 19:43.932
It's just a box.

19:49.521 --> 19:50.814
Careful. Careful.

20:06.246 --> 20:07.164
"Stay warm."

20:08.498 --> 20:10.042
How thoughtful.

20:10.125 --> 20:13.503
-I mean, unless it's a--
-Noah, what is it?

20:14.087 --> 20:14.922
I'll look.

20:17.674 --> 20:19.718
It's just clothes.

20:19.801 --> 20:21.303
[gasps]

20:26.141 --> 20:28.185
Holy shit!

20:28.268 --> 20:30.270
They're Gene's clothes.

20:30.354 --> 20:32.439
-That's what he was wearing.
-Oh, God!

20:32.522 --> 20:33.607
-Fuck.
-[Susan whimpers]

20:35.943 --> 20:38.987
Oh, no. No, no, no, I won't.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.490
-I won't.
-What are you--? What are you doing?

20:41.573 --> 20:43.200
I'm leaving!

20:43.283 --> 20:45.744
I'm going back to Gene's,
and getting in my SUV,

20:45.827 --> 20:47.537
-and getting out of this hell hole.
-No, no, no.

20:47.621 --> 20:50.207
-It's pitch black. It's a 30K walk.
-Yeah, then you'll die.

20:50.290 --> 20:52.709
I'd rather freeze to death
than get stabbed in my sleep.

20:52.793 --> 20:55.879
At least out there I have a chance.
I've hiked 30K before. I can do it.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.881
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I agree with Susan.

20:57.965 --> 20:59.675
I'd rather take my chances out there.

20:59.758 --> 21:01.343
That doesn't make any sense!
Wait until morning!

21:01.426 --> 21:05.180
No! No, no, no. Fuck that.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.057
I'm leaving with or without you.

21:07.140 --> 21:08.392
[door opens]

21:15.023 --> 21:15.857
Let's go.

21:19.861 --> 21:22.322
[Susan panting]

21:38.088 --> 21:40.799
Hey, you think this old RV still works?

21:56.898 --> 21:59.401
Susan, walk away right now.

21:59.484 --> 22:00.319
[Talvinder sniffling]

22:01.445 --> 22:02.404
Walk away.

22:04.906 --> 22:06.158
What happened?

22:06.241 --> 22:09.328
Seriously, you're playing dumb?

22:10.662 --> 22:13.540
-Dawn, get her away from me.
-Okay, okay.

22:14.791 --> 22:16.460
[Talvinder sobs]

22:16.543 --> 22:17.711
I didn't do this.

22:19.296 --> 22:21.381
-Okay, this is Talvinder doing exactly--
-Oh, really?

22:21.465 --> 22:25.093
Blame the victim? That's what
you're asking me to do right now?

22:25.177 --> 22:26.762
You're unbelievable. Get out of here.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.766
Get the fuck out of here, Susan!

22:38.231 --> 22:41.109
-It's okay. It's okay.
-[sobbing]

22:42.778 --> 22:44.988
[Susan panting]

22:48.909 --> 22:53.455
[Susan] We've walked like, 7K
in the last 45 minutes.

22:53.538 --> 22:58.085
At this rate, it'll take us three hours
to get to the outfitters.

23:02.297 --> 23:03.590
-What is this?
-What?

23:12.182 --> 23:15.352
Oh, shit.
The phone line has been cut.

23:15.435 --> 23:16.895
Oh!

23:16.978 --> 23:18.980
Someone's doing this on purpose.

23:19.064 --> 23:21.900
Someone's hunting us down and cutting
us off from the rest of the world.

23:21.983 --> 23:23.360
He might be out here, so shut up.

23:23.443 --> 23:24.903
-[howling]
-[gasps]

23:27.155 --> 23:30.075
-What is that?
-That's not a fucking squirrel.

23:31.409 --> 23:33.537
-[growling]
-Run!

23:33.620 --> 23:36.248
-What? Wait! Wait! No!
-Leave it!

23:40.669 --> 23:42.379
Do you think they're going to make it?

23:46.216 --> 23:47.759
Stop thinking about them.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.394
They never found her?

23:58.937 --> 24:02.023
The police looked everywhere, but no.
They never found her.

24:02.107 --> 24:04.484
-Not a trace?
-Nothing, nada.

24:05.777 --> 24:08.488
She's the reason
my family lost this camp.

24:08.572 --> 24:11.867
After she disappeared,
no one would send their kids here anymore.

24:11.950 --> 24:14.452
That is seriously screwed up.

24:14.536 --> 24:15.620
I need a cup of tea.

24:16.955 --> 24:18.707
So, how long ago did all that happen?

24:18.790 --> 24:21.710
My brother shut the camp down
about three years ago.

24:21.793 --> 24:24.379
It was a couple of years before that
when the girl disappeared.

24:26.047 --> 24:28.633
Noah said they were here for a reunion.

24:30.468 --> 24:32.345
Five years ago, they'd be the right age.

24:34.389 --> 24:35.807
Did they know her?

24:35.891 --> 24:37.559
It's got to be connected.

24:53.325 --> 24:54.784
[panting]

24:55.577 --> 24:56.995
[grunts]

24:57.746 --> 25:00.498
-Are you okay?
-I can't breathe. Hold on.

25:02.042 --> 25:04.169
I think whatever that was
that was following us is gone.

25:04.252 --> 25:06.838
[howling]

25:06.922 --> 25:09.633
I can't keep going on.
I'm exhausted,

25:09.716 --> 25:12.636
and I think every part
of my body is frozen.

25:12.719 --> 25:14.012
Okay, okay.

25:14.095 --> 25:15.972
Oh, fuck.

25:16.056 --> 25:17.891
What did, uh...

25:17.974 --> 25:19.684
What did one ghost say to the other ghost?

25:19.768 --> 25:21.895
-Fuck off.
-Hey.

25:21.978 --> 25:23.980
I'm changing the subject, okay?

25:25.190 --> 25:28.443
What did one ghost say to the other ghost?

25:28.526 --> 25:29.861
I have no idea.

25:29.945 --> 25:32.155
-Do you believe in people?
-[groans]

25:34.950 --> 25:35.867
That's hilarious.

25:37.244 --> 25:38.912
Just don't quit your day job.

25:38.995 --> 25:41.331
Now you tell me a joke. Okay?

25:41.414 --> 25:43.750
You tell me a joke
but we've got to keep walking.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.462
Come on.

25:47.545 --> 25:49.547
One foot in front of the other.

25:51.049 --> 25:51.883
One foot...

25:54.135 --> 25:54.970
in front of...

25:59.724 --> 26:00.558
What?

26:04.187 --> 26:06.314
[Noah groans]
Oh, come on!

26:08.441 --> 26:10.193
Are you fucking kidding me?

26:10.277 --> 26:11.736
We're going around in circles.

26:12.946 --> 26:14.739
Look, we're not good at this.

26:14.823 --> 26:16.408
If we keep going,
we're going to die out here.

26:16.491 --> 26:18.535
-We need to go back.
-No!

26:18.618 --> 26:21.079
-No!
-Susan, come on, please!

26:21.162 --> 26:24.416
-I can't go back there!
-You have to.

26:24.499 --> 26:25.750
We have no choice.

26:27.294 --> 26:29.004
We're not gonna make it.

26:44.769 --> 26:46.354
[loud thud]

26:48.523 --> 26:50.859
[panting]

26:53.903 --> 26:57.032
-What the hell were you thinking?
-Antoine, this is not the time.

26:58.241 --> 26:59.576
The phone lines.

26:59.659 --> 27:02.454
They didn't just come down in the wind.
They were cut on purpose.

27:03.455 --> 27:08.793
Noah, you're hypothermic
and you're frostbitten all over.

27:08.877 --> 27:11.838
I'm a trained nurse.
I'm going to take your socks off, okay?

27:16.092 --> 27:18.386
Oh, fuck, that is nasty.
You're going to lose those.

27:18.470 --> 27:22.599
Fuck, excellent bedside manner, guys.
You should be a doctor.

27:22.682 --> 27:24.142
[Keira] Wiggle your toes for me.

27:24.225 --> 27:25.977
[Noah groans]

27:26.061 --> 27:27.812
We won't know how bad it is
until you thaw out.

27:27.896 --> 27:28.813
We need to warm you up.

27:28.897 --> 27:31.149
Do you think I'm going to
lose my toes or anything

27:31.232 --> 27:33.151
-'cause I've grown attached to them.
-[Keira] Okay, relax.

27:33.234 --> 27:34.694
-No one's losing any body parts.
-Yeah?

27:34.778 --> 27:36.780
You should tell that to your buddy, Gene.

27:36.863 --> 27:38.531
You know what?
There are some heaters in the back.

27:38.615 --> 27:40.784
I'm going to get them.
We're going to save those piggies, okay?

27:40.867 --> 27:42.869
Those are propane heaters.
Do you want us all to suffocate?

27:42.952 --> 27:44.579
There's an electric heater in their cabin.

27:44.662 --> 27:46.414
Well then, go get it!

27:46.498 --> 27:49.459
Mark, go with her.
Tell Dawn and Peter what happened.

27:49.542 --> 27:51.169
Any other orders, sir?

27:51.252 --> 27:53.380
Oh, Jesus Christ,
you're gonna worry about that now?

27:53.463 --> 27:54.297
Antoine.

27:58.259 --> 28:00.887
I'm sorry. You're right. I'm...

28:00.970 --> 28:04.474
I should never have barked out
orders at you. Uh...

28:04.557 --> 28:06.851
My sincerest apologies.

28:06.935 --> 28:10.397
In the meantime,
what can I do to help Noah?

28:10.480 --> 28:12.649
Get a dish towel.
Warm it with some hot water,

28:12.732 --> 28:15.276
and hold it against his face,
his hands, and his feet.

28:45.640 --> 28:46.474
Peter.

28:48.268 --> 28:49.352
Peter.

28:51.312 --> 28:52.856
Peter.

28:52.939 --> 28:55.900
[breathes heavily]

28:55.984 --> 28:57.610
[rattling]

28:57.694 --> 28:58.653
[gasps]

29:06.369 --> 29:07.537
[screams]

29:08.997 --> 29:10.206
[Peter gasping]

29:12.041 --> 29:13.793
[Mark] Run. They got a gun.

29:19.340 --> 29:21.092
What the fuck, Dawn?
It's Keira and Mark.

29:24.095 --> 29:25.597
What the hell is wrong with you?

29:30.977 --> 29:33.021
[Mark] They have a gun.

29:33.104 --> 29:35.064
They have a gun. They shot at us.

29:36.316 --> 29:37.984
[Renee] Are you okay?

29:38.067 --> 29:38.902
I think so.

29:40.904 --> 29:42.989
Why did you bring a gun up here?

29:43.072 --> 29:45.116
-Answer me!
-We didn't.

29:45.200 --> 29:47.035
-No.
-Dawn, she brought the gun.

29:47.118 --> 29:50.330
We didn't even know she was packing heat
until like a couple of hours ago.

29:54.209 --> 29:56.377
I'm not the one, okay? Don't look at me--

29:56.461 --> 29:58.505
-We are looking at you, both of you!
-Answer her.

29:58.588 --> 29:59.923
Why'd your friend
bring a fucking gun here?

30:00.006 --> 30:02.467
-We have no idea!
-[Glenn] You're lying.

30:02.550 --> 30:05.678
-Look, we didn't do anything.
-Spare me! I'm not stupid.

30:05.762 --> 30:09.057
-Renee, please just listen to me.
-I'm done listening.

30:10.683 --> 30:11.601
And trusting.

30:14.729 --> 30:16.564
[pants]

30:18.399 --> 30:21.694
Dawn is 100 percent on Talvinder's side.

30:23.154 --> 30:26.574
-That girl is such a psychopath.
-Susan?

30:28.076 --> 30:30.745
Why should I believe you over them?

30:30.829 --> 30:33.331
Because we're friends, Andi.

30:33.414 --> 30:36.876
Because we've worked together
for the past three summers in a row,

30:36.960 --> 30:40.004
and have I ever done anything
to make you not trust me?

30:40.088 --> 30:40.922
No.

30:47.262 --> 30:49.514
I really wish I could spare you
from this...

30:51.766 --> 30:53.476
but you deserve to know the truth.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.774
[Susan sighs]

31:05.613 --> 31:07.615
[Talvinder panting]

31:11.828 --> 31:14.372
[moaning, panting]

31:21.379 --> 31:23.715
[Talvinder laughs]

31:35.602 --> 31:38.479
-[Peter] Come on. Give me the gun.
-What?

31:38.563 --> 31:40.690
We're going over to the main house
and explaining our psycho behavior!

31:40.773 --> 31:43.526
No, we're not. No fucking way!

31:43.610 --> 31:45.862
I will protect myself!

31:48.698 --> 31:50.575
You're starting to scare me right now.

31:52.702 --> 31:54.621
Dawn, give me the gun.

32:01.252 --> 32:02.420
Now!

32:14.015 --> 32:14.974
Take it.

32:16.267 --> 32:18.394
I don't want things to get any more
out of hand.

32:21.022 --> 32:22.649
I think we're past that point.

32:24.317 --> 32:25.360
If I meant you any harm,

32:25.443 --> 32:27.278
do you really think
I'd be giving this to you?

32:27.362 --> 32:28.863
Why do you even have a gun?

32:35.161 --> 32:39.290
Maybe... Dawn was just afraid
of being in the wilderness alone.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.502
Animals, I don't know.

32:42.585 --> 32:44.504
Five years ago, a young woman
disappeared from this camp

32:44.587 --> 32:47.799
-and you were all here, all five of you.
-That's not true! We had nothing--

32:47.882 --> 32:50.176
And now you're back
and people are getting killed.

32:50.259 --> 32:52.512
One of you brought a gun,
so I'm sorry if we don't believe you.

32:52.595 --> 32:53.888
There are just way too many coincidences.

32:53.972 --> 32:55.181
Too many lies.

32:55.264 --> 32:58.017
Noah, Susan, over here, now!

33:03.272 --> 33:05.692
Go to your cabin
and don't come back for any reason.

33:05.775 --> 33:08.569
We'll send you food but that's it.
This house is off limits.

33:08.653 --> 33:10.613
-Antoine, Renee, please.
-That's how it's gonna be!

33:10.697 --> 33:13.241
You come back,
I'll be the one using the gun!

33:14.242 --> 33:15.868
[door locks]

33:31.592 --> 33:33.511
Hey.

33:33.594 --> 33:35.221
You back?

33:35.304 --> 33:36.889
Yeah.

33:36.973 --> 33:38.558
And, thanks to you,
we're now under house arrest.

33:40.977 --> 33:41.811
House arrest?

33:43.354 --> 33:44.480
Where's the gun?

33:44.564 --> 33:45.565
[Noah] Uh...

33:45.648 --> 33:46.691
Don't ask.

33:49.360 --> 33:52.280
-Hello? Where's the gun?
-[Peter] Don't ask.

33:52.363 --> 33:53.698
I'm asking.

33:53.781 --> 33:55.533
-They took it.
-[Noah] If by "they took it,"

33:55.616 --> 33:58.453
you mean Peter handed it over
like a little bitch?

33:58.536 --> 34:01.497
-Then yeah, they took it.
-I'm sorry. Are you a fucking moron?

34:01.581 --> 34:02.415
[Susan] Stop!

34:04.000 --> 34:07.545
You don't get to be mad right now.
See, you're the reason we're in this mess.

34:07.628 --> 34:10.214
-Oh. I'm the reason?
-Yeah, you are.

34:10.298 --> 34:14.218
Guys, you guys really don't need
to fight right now, okay?

34:14.302 --> 34:18.514
-Can we just be a team, please?
-[Susan] No, this isn't a team, okay?

34:18.598 --> 34:21.434
I can barely stand the sight
of the three of you,

34:21.517 --> 34:25.897
let alone spend the night
with a bunch of fucking murderers!

34:25.980 --> 34:29.108
You guys all have blood on your hands.
You deserve to be in jail.

34:29.692 --> 34:32.570
-And you don't?
-No, I don't!

34:32.653 --> 34:34.155
I never touched Talvinder!

34:34.238 --> 34:36.574
I am the only one
who never laid a finger on her!

34:36.657 --> 34:39.744
-Please, don't do this right now!
-You're out of your fucking mind!

34:39.827 --> 34:42.455
-Dawn. Dawn.
-No, no, no! She needs to hear this.

34:42.538 --> 34:44.499
Hear what? What? What?

34:46.918 --> 34:50.546
None of this would have ever happened
if it wasn't for you

34:50.630 --> 34:53.591
and that sick little plan
that you cooked up

34:53.674 --> 34:54.967
to teach Talvinder a lesson.

34:55.051 --> 34:57.303
You started this. You own it.

34:57.887 --> 35:00.473
You lit the fucking match
and you ran away

35:00.556 --> 35:02.683
the second the whole thing
went up in flames!

35:02.767 --> 35:05.436
And now you stand there and you tell me
that you're better than us?

35:17.698 --> 35:18.741
I hope you're next.

35:30.044 --> 35:31.337
Should we go after her?

35:34.090 --> 35:35.341
Fuck her. I'm going to bed.

35:50.690 --> 35:52.942
[wind blowing]

36:04.787 --> 36:05.746
Andi, wait!

36:08.374 --> 36:09.917
Andi, wait!

36:10.001 --> 36:11.919
[sobbing]

36:13.671 --> 36:17.508
I trusted her and I... I defended her.

36:17.592 --> 36:19.886
And then she goes and she fucks--

36:19.969 --> 36:21.304
I know.

36:22.096 --> 36:26.976
I just wanna scream at her
until she fucking gets it!

36:28.769 --> 36:32.440
Yelling at her
isn't gonna make a difference.

36:32.523 --> 36:34.192
She's going to laugh in your face.

36:36.235 --> 36:40.448
So, what... what are you saying,
just don't bother?

36:41.741 --> 36:42.575
No.

36:45.328 --> 36:46.162
I'm saying...

36:48.497 --> 36:53.085
if you want to have an impact on her,
you need to think like her.

36:53.169 --> 36:56.422
We come up with a plan, we set it up,
and execute it.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.638
You know, I'm sorry you had to see that.

37:08.100 --> 37:09.602
You have to be patient, okay?

37:11.646 --> 37:13.814
I promise you...

37:13.898 --> 37:16.692
we'll make her pay for what she's done...

37:16.776 --> 37:19.946
so she never does this again.

37:41.842 --> 37:43.928
[gasps, screams]

37:44.011 --> 37:45.888
[pants]

37:58.150 --> 38:01.946
[Talvinder sobbing, screaming]

38:02.029 --> 38:05.408
Please! Oh, no!

38:05.491 --> 38:07.201
Stop it!

38:10.413 --> 38:12.623
[sobbing continues]

38:12.707 --> 38:15.459
Susan, the plan fucking changed!

38:15.543 --> 38:18.129
-So, what are we going to do now?
-Oh, no.

38:20.756 --> 38:25.136
-Peter--
-Susan! Susan! Susan, I'm sorry.

38:26.762 --> 38:30.057
I... I can't do this. I can't do that!

38:31.434 --> 38:33.936
-No, I can't do this. No!
-Susan-- Susan!

38:34.020 --> 38:35.855
-No!
-Susan!

38:38.774 --> 38:41.527
[Susan screaming]

38:59.128 --> 39:02.298
[groans, screams]

39:18.773 --> 39:21.776
[sobbing]

39:29.283 --> 39:31.660
-[metallic clank]
-[Susan screams]

39:40.419 --> 39:43.422
[scraping]

39:47.176 --> 39:49.637
[Susan screaming]

39:53.224 --> 39:55.518
[pants, screams]

40:00.272 --> 40:02.358
No! Oh, please.

40:02.441 --> 40:05.403
No! [screams]

40:05.486 --> 40:07.863
-[stabs]
-[screaming]

40:12.535 --> 40:15.704
[Talvinder screaming]

40:17.248 --> 40:19.667
[Talvinder] Stop it, please!

40:19.750 --> 40:25.381
[screaming loudly] No!

40:25.464 --> 40:27.216
No!

40:31.971 --> 40:33.722
[Susan sobbing]

40:40.396 --> 40:43.441
[sobs]

40:56.704 --> 40:58.706
[Susan screaming]

41:06.630 --> 41:09.258
[Judith shifts, sighs]

41:11.385 --> 41:12.970
[shouts]

41:13.053 --> 41:15.973
Judith, Judith, it's okay.

41:16.056 --> 41:19.018
It's okay. It's okay... it's me.

41:19.101 --> 41:21.103
Oh, Wren!

41:21.187 --> 41:23.022
[pants]

41:25.232 --> 41:28.319
I was just, I was going to stay in here
and keep an eye on you,

41:28.402 --> 41:29.987
but you fell asleep.

41:30.070 --> 41:32.865
How did you get in here?
How did I not hear you? How...

41:36.410 --> 41:37.286
I'm not surprised.

41:41.415 --> 41:42.917
It's been a hell of a day.

41:51.884 --> 41:52.718
Let me, um..

41:54.803 --> 41:55.930
help you relax.

42:16.534 --> 42:17.618
Can you feel my breath?

42:28.003 --> 42:29.296
Is that all right?

42:39.765 --> 42:40.933
Breathe with me, Judith.

42:48.524 --> 42:49.358
Right down.

42:51.360 --> 42:52.194
Yeah.

42:54.989 --> 42:56.615
Right down to your pelvis.

42:58.409 --> 42:59.577
Feel your whole body.

43:05.332 --> 43:06.166
Yeah...

43:07.585 --> 43:09.420
Yeah.

43:09.503 --> 43:10.337
Is that better?

43:16.302 --> 43:17.136
Good.

43:23.934 --> 43:25.394
Okay, you get some sleep.

43:31.066 --> 43:33.027
I'm just down the hall if you need me.

43:50.044 --> 43:51.879
[door closes]

43:54.048 --> 43:55.758
You sure you don't want
to carry this thing?

43:55.841 --> 43:57.468
I can carry more than firewood.

43:57.551 --> 44:00.304
If we have to fire it, I'll probably
shoot you in the head.

44:07.603 --> 44:08.771
[screams]

44:08.854 --> 44:11.106
-What?
-Oh, my God.

44:34.630 --> 44:35.714
How do you do it?

44:37.466 --> 44:38.926
You seem so...

44:41.220 --> 44:42.054
together.

44:43.847 --> 44:45.474
I pretend that night never happened.

44:47.101 --> 44:48.227
I don't think about it...

44:49.895 --> 44:51.605
ever.

44:51.688 --> 44:53.982
But it did happen...

44:54.066 --> 44:56.985
and we all have to live
with the consequences.

44:57.069 --> 44:58.779
Well...

44:58.862 --> 45:01.532
some of us have more to regret
than others.

45:06.912 --> 45:09.081
The next time I see you,
I'll just keep walking.

45:11.083 --> 45:11.959
Yeah.

45:15.170 --> 45:16.046
Susan?

45:18.173 --> 45:20.384
Good luck pretending it never happened.
