WEBVTT

00:07.741 --> 00:08.800
Why?

00:09.042 --> 00:11.034
Twenty minutes a day, Jim.
That's all it takes.

00:12.045 --> 00:13.741
Twenty minutes a day,
all feet, no hands,

00:13.881 --> 00:15.611
and I'll have
the pedidexterity of a chimp,

00:15.682 --> 00:18.083
and you'll be sitting
there like an idiot.

00:18.485 --> 00:20.750
Okay, here we go. Yes.

00:21.421 --> 00:22.889
Do you mind?
I'm sorry, Pam.

00:23.290 --> 00:25.225
Allow me to write
you an apology letter.

00:26.126 --> 00:27.822
You don't have to do that.

00:27.995 --> 00:28.985
D...

00:29.296 --> 00:30.320
E...

00:31.532 --> 00:32.864
A...

00:33.066 --> 00:34.295
Oh...

00:34.601 --> 00:37.594
Backspace,
A... Dear...

00:42.309 --> 00:43.572
Thank you, hands.

00:43.644 --> 00:46.045
Nothing else in the universe
can do what you do.

00:54.221 --> 00:57.487
Don't worry about it.
Dwight, it's okay.
You were wrong.

00:57.858 --> 00:58.848
It's so hot.

01:07.367 --> 01:09.131
Well, "A" for effort, right?

01:13.000 --> 01:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:25.152 --> 01:27.280
Welcome.
Start your morning right

01:27.421 --> 01:29.549
with a burst of
blueberry or try plain.

01:29.623 --> 01:30.613
What's the occasion?

01:30.691 --> 01:33.058
Dwight said this entry
was a waste of space.

01:33.126 --> 01:37.120
I would like
<i>un muffin du</i> blueberry,
<i>por favor.</i>

01:37.798 --> 01:38.788
$8.

01:38.865 --> 01:39.855
$8?

01:40.300 --> 01:43.099
Owning a building is a war
between
the landlord and the tenant.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.002
Not a literal war,
unfortunately,

01:45.138 --> 01:46.970
but I am using
the same tactics.

01:47.207 --> 01:51.110
<i>I've surrounded the enemy,</i>
<i>and I'm slowly starving them.</i>

01:51.178 --> 01:53.272
<i>To save on electricity,</i>
<i>I have installed a timer</i>

01:53.413 --> 01:55.507
<i>and motion</i>
<i>sensors on the lights.</i>

01:55.582 --> 01:59.576
It's part of my
green initiative.
And by green, I mean money.

02:01.488 --> 02:02.512
Mmm-hmm.

02:02.589 --> 02:04.615
China. China.

02:04.992 --> 02:06.153
Michael, how was the dentist?

02:07.027 --> 02:08.050
It was great.

02:08.328 --> 02:09.352
China.

02:10.062 --> 02:11.087
Are you okay?
What's wrong?

02:11.665 --> 02:13.224
Everything here was
made in China, Pam.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.563
Yeah, that's where
they make stuff.

02:14.635 --> 02:17.662
They used to make
stuff in America, Andy,
but we're falling behind.

02:17.738 --> 02:18.728
Did you know that?

02:18.905 --> 02:22.501
China is a sleeping dragon
that is just
beginning to stir.

02:22.576 --> 02:23.805
Oh, no.
Yeah.

02:24.011 --> 02:26.378
Right here.
It is right there.

02:27.881 --> 02:29.247
Anybody read the news anymore?

02:30.951 --> 02:32.214
"China is on the move."

02:32.285 --> 02:34.777
I found that in
the waiting room
at the dentist's office.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.756
This kid had
the magazine I wanted to read.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.314
That's the only
one I could reach,

02:38.458 --> 02:39.983
and I read it and
then I read it again.

02:40.127 --> 02:43.461
My whole life I believed
that America was number one.

02:43.530 --> 02:44.793
That was the saying.

02:44.865 --> 02:48.199
Not America's number two.
England is number two.

02:48.268 --> 02:51.705
China should be, like, eight.

02:52.673 --> 02:53.663
Hey, Andy.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.100
Hey, Darryl.

02:55.475 --> 02:57.307
You gotta stop
texting me so much.

02:59.212 --> 03:01.807
But I wanted you to know that
Michael and I are
wearing the same tie today.

03:01.882 --> 03:02.872
It's insane.

03:03.183 --> 03:06.176
You need to
change your standard
for what's worthy of a text.

03:06.253 --> 03:09.519
Ask yourself,
"Is this something
Darryl needs to know?"

03:09.589 --> 03:11.285
The answer's
almost always "no."

03:11.892 --> 03:13.520
Got it.
Then, I will call you.

03:13.593 --> 03:14.583
No.

03:14.995 --> 03:17.464
There was a time
when the only
people who texted you

03:17.531 --> 03:20.763
were people you
wanted to text you. Girls.

03:20.834 --> 03:24.066
And they'd all
say the same thing.
"I'm coming over, baby."

03:24.137 --> 03:28.939
And I would text back. B-T-B.
"Bring that Booty."

03:30.110 --> 03:34.047
Dwight.
Why is the toilet
paper only half a ply?

03:34.481 --> 03:36.950
I'm sorry.
Is that not good
enough for your anus?

03:38.518 --> 03:40.987
Don't get me started on
how coddled
the modern anus is.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.545
Okay, Stanley,

03:42.622 --> 03:45.091
maybe you can just
unspool a little more
each time you need to...

03:45.158 --> 03:47.093
Don't tell me how
to do my business.

03:47.694 --> 03:51.756
Stanley, as a fellow
Dunder Mifflin employee,
I feel for you,

03:51.832 --> 03:54.529
but, like you,
I am completely powerless

03:54.601 --> 03:55.762
to the whims of
the new building owner.

03:55.836 --> 03:56.826
Which is you.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.595
"Which is you"
is not a sentence.

03:58.772 --> 04:00.035
I disagree with.

04:00.173 --> 04:01.869
Are you gonna just sit there,
office administrator,

04:01.942 --> 04:03.604
or are you gonna do something?

04:05.746 --> 04:08.045
Dwight, can we talk
about these cut backs?

04:08.315 --> 04:11.513
Pam, when I'm
sitting at this desk,
I'm a salesman.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.144
If you wanna talk to
the new building owner,

04:13.220 --> 04:15.086
you should call Nate
and schedule an appointment.

04:15.388 --> 04:16.879
I'm not gonna do that.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.983
Well, then you're
not going to talk
to the new building owner,

04:19.059 --> 04:20.048
which is a shame,

04:20.127 --> 04:21.789
because I hear he's
a very reasonable guy.

04:24.464 --> 04:26.365
<i>Y'ello?</i>
Hi, Nate. It's Pam Halpert.

04:26.433 --> 04:27.423
<i>Oh, hey, Pam.</i>

04:27.501 --> 04:30.369
Hey,
I would just love to schedule
a meeting today with Dwight.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.905
<i>Let me put you on hold</i>
<i>just for one eensy second.</i>

04:33.206 --> 04:34.333
Sure.

04:37.711 --> 04:38.804
Dwight Schrute.

04:39.045 --> 04:40.035
Mmm-hmm.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.040
Tell her I'm busy.

04:43.250 --> 04:44.274
I don't know.
Make something up.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.684
NATE: <i>Hey, Pam,</i>
<i>Dwight's being</i>
<i>questioned by the police</i>

04:48.755 --> 04:52.658
<i>in connection with</i>
<i>a string of dognappings</i>
<i>that have been...</i>

04:53.226 --> 04:54.216
Dwight.

04:55.562 --> 04:58.589
Dwight, can you please tell
the new building owner

04:58.665 --> 05:01.032
that he is screwing over
all the people he works with.

05:01.101 --> 05:03.764
People he's
worked with for years,
his friends.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.065
You know what, Pam?
You're right.

05:08.942 --> 05:10.069
This isn't just a business,

05:11.344 --> 05:13.108
this is a home.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.274
And I would much rather see
a smile from Kevin

05:15.348 --> 05:17.977
than save hundreds
on plumbing and electricity.

05:20.353 --> 05:21.343
ERIN: Oh, my God.

05:21.454 --> 05:22.444
What?

05:22.522 --> 05:25.424
According to the Internet,
the tallest man in
the world is Chinese.

05:25.725 --> 05:27.523
So much for keeping
our secrets up high.

05:27.861 --> 05:28.851
What's America gonna do?

05:29.062 --> 05:31.497
I know what we're gonna do.
We're gonna put
our best minds on it.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.631
Everybody, stop working.

05:36.736 --> 05:38.602
I want you all
to imagine a world

05:38.672 --> 05:40.868
in which America is not
the number one superpower,

05:42.042 --> 05:43.510
where forks are irrelevant,

05:44.477 --> 05:46.469
and where every man,
woman and child

05:47.047 --> 05:49.312
is expected to learn
how to play the cello.

05:50.517 --> 05:51.507
Now, open your eyes.

05:51.585 --> 05:52.951
You never told
us to close them.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.484
Welcome to your future.

05:54.621 --> 05:56.146
What do we do?
How do we stop this?

05:56.456 --> 05:59.585
How do we stop it?
With a big idea.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.258
That's what
America is built on.

06:02.329 --> 06:05.925
Big ideas,
blue jeans, the Grand Canyon.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.934
Who's got one?
Who's got a big idea?

06:08.001 --> 06:09.560
An idea bigger
than the Grand Canyon?

06:09.703 --> 06:11.296
MICHAEL: Yes, indeed.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.362
Yes, Kevin.

06:13.707 --> 06:17.474
An antacid that you
only take once a week.

06:18.478 --> 06:22.779
Once-a-week antacid
is the idea to beat.
Anyone else?

06:23.583 --> 06:24.744
Nobody?

06:24.818 --> 06:25.808
Okay, then, we are...

06:25.886 --> 06:26.876
Michael.
Yes.

06:26.953 --> 06:31.516
An antacid pill
that you take
once every six weeks.

06:31.591 --> 06:33.253
Why not just go
one for the year?

06:33.326 --> 06:34.316
I don't know.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.329
It's too big
a pill to swallow.
MICHAEL: All right.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.298
What if we all get together
and help each other,

06:39.366 --> 06:41.460
and hire a new guy
and then we all kill him,

06:41.534 --> 06:44.561
but first we take out, like,
a $100,000 life
insurance policy?

06:44.638 --> 06:46.402
I bet you guys like
that idea, don't you?

06:47.807 --> 06:49.332
I think that's what
they're doing to me.

06:49.409 --> 06:52.868
I can't prove it,
but I wanted to see
their faces when I said it.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.209
I learned nothing.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.749
I don't know
what the  that was.

06:56.816 --> 06:57.806
I say we bomb 'em.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.149
By 2020, they're gonna be
the world's largest economy,

07:00.220 --> 07:03.122
and they're getting
a taste for protein.
We'll all starve.

07:03.189 --> 07:04.657
Yeah, Dwight's right,
we should drop the bomb.

07:04.724 --> 07:05.987
MICHAEL: No, he's not right.
We're not...

07:06.059 --> 07:07.789
Where would we
even drop it, Phyllis?

07:08.228 --> 07:12.427
Did you know that in China
there are 56 cities
with over a million people?

07:12.499 --> 07:14.331
You know how many
we have here? Nine.

07:14.401 --> 07:15.892
Actually, that's not true.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.631
I know the figure
you're referring to,

07:17.771 --> 07:19.433
and it's a projection
of 15 years from now.

07:19.506 --> 07:20.530
KEVIN: Thank God.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.098
No. No,
that is right now.

07:22.375 --> 07:25.470
Michael, China's agrarian.
Urbanizing fast?
You betcha.

07:25.545 --> 07:26.535
But still agrarian.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.076
Most in terms of land,
not population.

07:29.149 --> 07:30.378
Come on,
Michael, you couldn't...

07:30.517 --> 07:31.746
No! No, you're
wrong about this.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.184
Where are you
getting this information?

07:34.254 --> 07:35.916
I got it from
newyorktimes.com.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.013
Uh-oh.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.059
Getting nervous, Oscar?

07:39.125 --> 07:40.252
Okay, someone
look it up.

07:40.393 --> 07:41.554
I'm on it, Jim. I'm on it.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.062
Guys, it's not worth it.
Really.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.098
Guys, this is not
worth our time.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.031
"Are you watching this?"
Seriously?

07:47.801 --> 07:48.791
Well, are you?

07:49.002 --> 07:50.197
I'm sitting right here.

07:50.637 --> 07:51.832
DARRYL: Got it.

07:52.238 --> 07:55.640
China has 56 cities
with a population
of over one million.

07:55.709 --> 07:58.611
The U.S. has nine.

07:59.112 --> 08:01.104
Suck it, Oscar.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.150
Well, on the plus side,
all this worrying about China

08:03.216 --> 08:04.912
has made you smarter
than Oscar, Michael.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.346
Great, I was wrong.

08:06.519 --> 08:07.987
I'm wrong.
Is everyone happy?

08:09.222 --> 08:12.056
So, I happen to know more
than the smartest
guy in the office.

08:12.125 --> 08:15.527
So what?
I don't care.

08:15.762 --> 08:18.857
Okay, now, where were we
before I bested Oscar?

08:21.468 --> 08:23.869
Wow, so this
building can get uglier.

08:23.937 --> 08:26.930
I will not work in
a roach billboard.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.033
Oh, my God.
I can't look at roaches.

08:29.376 --> 08:30.901
Michael,
do something about this.

08:30.977 --> 08:33.378
Absolutely.
Pam, this is exactly why

08:33.446 --> 08:35.005
I hired you as
office administrator.

08:35.081 --> 08:36.071
Handle it.

08:36.216 --> 08:37.548
Taking care
of business.

08:39.251 --> 08:40.413
Dwight, take it down.

08:42.489 --> 08:44.549
I'm serious.
Take it down or else.

08:44.824 --> 08:47.316
Or else. Or else what?
There's nothing you can do.

08:48.928 --> 08:50.157
We can move out.

08:56.302 --> 08:57.326
Ugh.

08:57.404 --> 08:58.394
Really?

09:05.979 --> 09:09.575
So, does anyone wanna know
where I've been for
the last two hours?

09:09.649 --> 09:12.141
Oh, my God, I've been playing
Zombie Soccer for two hours?

09:12.218 --> 09:15.188
I went out to look for
a better office space.

09:15.455 --> 09:16.855
Waste of time.
Not really,

09:17.223 --> 09:18.452
because I found one.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.084
JIM: Oh, wow.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.217
These are nice.
Yep.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.285
Let me see.

09:24.764 --> 09:26.164
Look at the huge offices, Jim.
Yeah, I know.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.258
Check out that
conference room.
Totally.

09:28.334 --> 09:29.563
You can't just move out.

09:29.702 --> 09:30.965
Oh, in three months we can.

09:31.037 --> 09:32.027
Check the lease.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.097
And if you don't
undo all the changes
you've made, we're moving.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.642
Hey, guys,
can I show you some pictures?

09:35.775 --> 09:37.903
Oh, my gosh, she's so cute.
She looks like both of you.

09:37.977 --> 09:39.775
They're not of Cece.
Oh, cool.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.215
This is possibly our new
Dunder Mifflin office.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.308
Well, I like being
in the same building as Bob.

09:44.384 --> 09:45.443
It keeps me honest.

09:45.518 --> 09:48.511
Well, this building isn't far,
and it's much newer.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.750
There's a dry cleaner,
a nail place and a gym.

09:51.291 --> 09:52.657
Oh, and it's next
door to an Outback,

09:52.792 --> 09:54.158
so it always
smells like steak.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.785
Are you trying to kill me?

09:56.996 --> 09:58.726
Is the nail place
Koreans or whites?

09:58.932 --> 09:59.922
Koreans.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.898
Good. And the dry cleaners?

10:02.068 --> 10:03.058
White?

10:03.169 --> 10:04.159
Good.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.507
Whoa,
there's a lot of brain power
in this room.

10:12.645 --> 10:15.444
We got Michael and Oscar,
the two smartest
guys in the office.

10:15.715 --> 10:17.081
Also, in that order.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.617
Funny. Jim, that is funny.

10:18.685 --> 10:20.278
Very comedically
humorous, Jim.

10:20.353 --> 10:21.548
KELLY:
I have a computer question.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.112
Hey, Oscar?
What is it?

10:23.189 --> 10:24.657
Can you move aside
so that I can ask Michael?

10:24.724 --> 10:25.851
All right.
All right, I get it.

10:26.392 --> 10:27.860
Michael,
how do I create a new tab?

10:28.128 --> 10:30.097
Try control "P."

10:30.163 --> 10:31.153
That's print.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.163
Not if the printer
isn't hooked up.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.429
You are making some very
dangerous assumptions, Oscar.

10:35.902 --> 10:38.371
Oscar, it must be killing you
now that Michael
is smarter than you.

10:38.438 --> 10:42.534
He's not smarter than me.
He was just right
about one thing.

10:42.609 --> 10:46.671
Yeah, but it was
a really smart thing
to be right about, actually.

10:46.746 --> 10:48.374
Actually, it was.

10:48.615 --> 10:51.210
Around here,
Oscar is known as "Actually,"

10:51.484 --> 10:54.454
because he will insert himself
into just about
any conversation

10:54.521 --> 10:57.355
<i>to add facts or</i>
<i>correct grammar.</i>

10:57.457 --> 10:58.686
Actually, you're speculating.

10:58.758 --> 11:02.752
He really does fit
that old stereotype
of the smug, gay Mexican.

11:04.731 --> 11:07.257
"Megan Fox. Question mark."
What's that mean?

11:08.301 --> 11:10.099
Megan Fox. Come on.

11:10.570 --> 11:11.833
You know what?

11:11.905 --> 11:14.704
You're one bad text away
from getting blocked.

11:14.807 --> 11:17.709
Yes, but one good text
away from a high five.

11:17.777 --> 11:18.767
You accept these terms?

11:19.078 --> 11:20.068
Oh, it's on.

11:21.047 --> 11:24.848
In your perfect world,
what would make
this building awesome?

11:24.984 --> 11:27.010
I'm putting together
kind of a wish list.

11:27.086 --> 11:29.646
I wish for a million wishes.

11:29.722 --> 11:30.712
Yeah,

11:31.090 --> 11:32.558
no, I'm not a genie.
I'm just talking about...

11:32.625 --> 11:34.321
Then see you later,
building.

11:34.460 --> 11:35.587
DWIGHT: You can't
possibly be serious.

11:35.728 --> 11:36.855
I said,
"See you later, building."

11:36.930 --> 11:38.796
Hey, Michael.
Hey.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.130
I was thinking
about some of the stuff
you said earlier about China.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.191
Mmm.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.099
I'd love to
talk more about it.
Yeah.

11:44.671 --> 11:45.832
Maybe over
some coffee later?

11:45.972 --> 11:47.304
Sure.

11:50.677 --> 11:52.646
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Do you know what
you just agreed to?

11:52.712 --> 11:54.010
Just coffee, Jim.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.479
No, it is not just coffee.

11:56.983 --> 11:58.417
He's trying to
set you up, Michael.

11:58.585 --> 11:59.678
What's gonna happen is

11:59.752 --> 12:01.243
he's gonna try to
bring up whatever

12:01.387 --> 12:02.878
you're talking about
in a very casual way.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.757
But secretly he'll be
trying to trip you up.

12:05.825 --> 12:07.851
And when he does,
boom, it's awful.

12:08.361 --> 12:09.385
Haven't you noticed that

12:09.462 --> 12:10.623
I don't bring up
the Tour de France
around him?

12:10.730 --> 12:11.720
Yes.

12:12.198 --> 12:16.226
And then,
he will smugly pay the check
and make you feel so small.

12:17.770 --> 12:20.934
All right, well,
I just need to learn
everything about China.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.037
To be safe, I should learn
everything about everything,

12:23.109 --> 12:24.702
but I don't have time,
okay? Okay.

12:24.811 --> 12:26.336
I'll just learn about China

12:26.412 --> 12:30.782
and science and geography
and math and literary.

12:30.850 --> 12:31.909
No politics?

12:31.985 --> 12:34.147
I'm pretty good on politics.

12:34.220 --> 12:36.086
California is bankrupt.

12:36.155 --> 12:38.386
And California, California.

12:44.364 --> 12:45.354
What?

12:47.600 --> 12:49.660
Parlay.
My office. Five minutes.

12:50.637 --> 12:51.627
Parlay?

12:52.939 --> 12:54.908
Pirate code. He wants to meet.

12:55.141 --> 12:57.076
So, everyone here
knows pirate code?

12:57.143 --> 12:58.907
I understand it.
I can't speak it.

13:00.813 --> 13:03.942
Pam, I am not
an unreasonable man.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.919
If you guys stay,
I will stop
watering down the soap.

13:07.153 --> 13:08.951
You've been
watering down the soap?

13:09.022 --> 13:11.753
Why do you even need soap?
Are you that bad at
going to the bathroom?

13:11.824 --> 13:13.759
We want everything
back the way it was.

13:13.993 --> 13:15.154
You don't wanna move.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.527
Moving is one of
the most stressful things
you can do in life.

13:17.597 --> 13:19.498
You'll probably just
take it out on your kid.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.625
Jim will turn to the drink.
The family will fall apart.

13:22.735 --> 13:23.964
And 25 years from now,

13:24.437 --> 13:28.738
Cece will become world
famous for stripping.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.136
That's a sad story.
I have another one.

13:33.212 --> 13:35.772
We move,
the other tenants follow,

13:35.848 --> 13:36.941
the bank takes the building,

13:37.016 --> 13:39.645
takes your farm,
takes your car and
beats the crap out of you.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.048
Penniless, you die.

13:41.120 --> 13:44.921
And my daughter, Cece,
dances on your
grave fully clothed.

13:55.201 --> 13:56.499
RYAN: Where is Tibet?

13:57.603 --> 13:58.593
Pass.

13:58.805 --> 13:59.795
When was China founded?

14:00.273 --> 14:01.639
Pass.
Two for two. Keep it up.

14:01.708 --> 14:02.698
Who is Mao?

14:04.977 --> 14:06.036
Life line.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.238
Damn it, Michael.

14:07.380 --> 14:10.509
You are moments away
from the smack down
of your life.

14:10.950 --> 14:11.940
If you don't know something,

14:12.018 --> 14:13.987
steer the conversation back
to something you do know.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.983
I could talk about boobs.
I bet he knows
nothing about boobs.

14:17.056 --> 14:18.217
What do you know
about boobs?

14:21.661 --> 14:22.890
Michael, I have
to tell you something.

14:22.995 --> 14:24.122
It's from <i>Rocky II.</i>
Thank you.

14:26.332 --> 14:28.358
"This guy
doesn't just wanna win,

14:28.501 --> 14:30.561
"you know,
he wants to bury you.

14:30.636 --> 14:32.127
"He wants to humiliate you."

14:32.205 --> 14:34.106
Wait, wait, wait.
How long is this gonna take?

14:34.240 --> 14:35.572
I'm, like,
a quarter of the way through.

14:35.708 --> 14:36.698
Is it gonna be worth it?

14:37.276 --> 14:38.266
No.

14:38.344 --> 14:40.779
Just in case, Michael,
I made you a cheat sheet.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.037
I don't need to cheat.

14:42.281 --> 14:43.271
Show him how to use it.

14:43.750 --> 14:44.911
10,706...

14:45.051 --> 14:46.212
Here it is, right here.

14:46.285 --> 14:47.514
Pull over. Pull over.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.319
Oh, my God.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.184
No way.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.256
Man, look at that.

14:54.327 --> 14:55.351
Yeah.

14:55.428 --> 14:56.794
There's no building.

14:58.131 --> 14:59.360
This can only mean one thing.

14:59.499 --> 15:00.762
Building's underground.

15:00.833 --> 15:02.131
She was lying.

15:02.201 --> 15:03.294
Oh.

15:03.369 --> 15:05.133
Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam.

15:05.271 --> 15:07.035
Pam, Pam, Pam.

15:07.106 --> 15:08.096
Yeah?

15:08.374 --> 15:09.398
Pam?

15:09.509 --> 15:10.875
What?
I'm Pam.

15:11.310 --> 15:12.710
DWIGHT: Oh.
No, you're not.

15:12.812 --> 15:15.281
I'm sorry, we have a colleague
with the same name.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.816
Oh, that's funny.

15:16.949 --> 15:18.440
You're not
a liar too, are you?

15:19.485 --> 15:20.817
I've been known
to bend the truth.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.715
Damn it, Pam. Get out.

15:22.989 --> 15:25.185
Right now.
Leave it. I mean it.
Get the hell out of here.

15:25.358 --> 15:26.690
Go!

15:27.794 --> 15:32.129
I can't wait to do to Pam
what I just did to Pam.

15:34.634 --> 15:35.624
Hey, Pam?

15:35.768 --> 15:36.758
Yeah.

15:36.836 --> 15:38.134
You know,
I'm the only one here

15:38.271 --> 15:39.603
that you haven't asked
about the new office.

15:39.839 --> 15:42.138
I know,
because you're
the reason we're moving.

15:42.208 --> 15:44.473
Yeah, but I'm
still an employee here,

15:44.544 --> 15:47.139
and that part of
me is really excited
about the change of scenery.

15:47.513 --> 15:48.913
What's the square
footage in the new place?

15:49.115 --> 15:50.640
I think it's
something like...

15:50.750 --> 15:52.343
What's the exact
square footage?

15:52.418 --> 15:53.545
Um...

15:53.619 --> 15:54.609
Let me see.

15:54.687 --> 15:55.677
DWIGHT: How many
offices are there?

15:55.788 --> 15:57.586
I'll just look at
the one-sheet myself.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.455
Actually, I don't know
what I did with the one-sheet.

15:59.859 --> 16:03.091
You know, that's the problem.
You only have one sheet.

16:03.162 --> 16:04.357
üDWIGHT LAUGHING
SARCASTICALLYä

16:05.264 --> 16:06.755
Oh, you're
a funny guy, Pam.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.697
What's the first thing
you guys are gonna do

16:09.836 --> 16:11.600
when you move
into the new office?

16:11.671 --> 16:13.139
I'm gonna walk down the hall,
and I'm gonna say,

16:13.206 --> 16:17.200
"Wow, I can't believe
this is real, but it is."

16:17.643 --> 16:19.578
I can't wait.
Mmm-hmm.

16:21.180 --> 16:23.843
I lied about some
aspects of the building.

16:23.916 --> 16:24.906
It's still on a bike path,
though, right?

16:25.117 --> 16:26.813
There's no building.
It doesn't exist.

16:26.886 --> 16:27.945
What does that mean?

16:28.154 --> 16:30.521
I needed leverage,
so I pulled those
pictures off the Internet.

16:30.790 --> 16:32.452
It's just this...

16:32.525 --> 16:34.858
This office
administrator thing,
I don't want to...

16:36.162 --> 16:37.255
What?

16:37.763 --> 16:40.597
Fail.
I don't want
to fail. Again.

16:40.666 --> 16:41.656
You didn't fail.

16:41.734 --> 16:43.430
That's what you
said about art school,

16:43.569 --> 16:45.265
and that's what
you said about sales.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.371
And you didn't fail
those things either.

16:48.708 --> 16:54.409
Well, I'm not an artist,
and I'm not a salesman.

16:54.480 --> 16:55.641
So, what would you call it?

16:56.382 --> 16:58.851
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

17:00.419 --> 17:03.082
Michael, the reason
I asked you down
here for this chat is

17:03.155 --> 17:04.851
I've been
thinking that your fears

17:04.991 --> 17:06.721
about China are
a bit exaggerated.

17:06.791 --> 17:09.921
Did you know that
China has a new missile

17:10.096 --> 17:13.191
that can sink a U.S.
naval carrier
900 miles off the coast?

17:13.266 --> 17:14.256
We have missiles, too.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.199
Did you also know
that China has secretly

17:16.335 --> 17:18.201
been expanding
its nuclear arsenal?

17:18.503 --> 17:19.528
But what do I know?

17:19.605 --> 17:21.471
I mean, that's just
according to the Pentagon.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.634
Our Pentagon.

17:27.512 --> 17:28.708
I wasn't here.

17:28.848 --> 17:30.043
What?

17:31.083 --> 17:33.780
I wasn't here.
It's a pretty common saying.

17:33.853 --> 17:35.822
You may want to log
it away for future use.

17:36.155 --> 17:37.521
Well, thanks.
Yeah.

17:39.825 --> 17:43.853
China has been loaning us
billions upon
billions of dollars.

17:43.930 --> 17:47.059
We are going to be owing them
for the rest of our lives,

17:47.133 --> 17:48.123
and they will control us.

17:48.200 --> 17:53.002
Actually, we're in
a mild recession right now,
I'll give you that,

17:53.172 --> 17:55.505
but people use
China as the boogeyman
for all their problems.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.271
In the 1980s, it was Japan.

17:57.343 --> 18:00.507
How then do you
explain that in the past year

18:00.646 --> 18:03.810
manufacturing in
China has risen by 17%,

18:04.483 --> 18:06.918
and in the U.S.
it has only risen by 8%?

18:06.986 --> 18:09.285
Do you really think
that manufacturing
is a relevant indicator

18:09.355 --> 18:11.824
of where the world
economy's heading
in 2011?

18:13.092 --> 18:14.560
Do you know
the comparative expansion

18:14.694 --> 18:16.162
of, say, the
information sector?

18:16.228 --> 18:18.720
I'd say that's
far more relevant,
wouldn't you?

18:20.900 --> 18:22.163
Don't...

18:26.739 --> 18:27.729
I...

18:34.213 --> 18:35.841
Hello. Hello.

18:35.915 --> 18:37.941
You're breaking the law.
Impossible. I love the law.

18:38.084 --> 18:39.575
Read article 19.

18:39.652 --> 18:42.417
There are certain standards
that you have to
maintain the building at,

18:42.488 --> 18:45.458
and that includes
comfortable temperatures
and adequate lighting.

18:45.524 --> 18:48.460
It also means no more cutting
the tampons in two,

18:48.527 --> 18:50.655
and no more tampering
with the toilet paper.

18:51.797 --> 18:55.461
I see I've underestimated you,
and I didn't think
that was possible.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.034
Nate.

18:58.404 --> 18:59.497
Re-ply the paper.

19:00.106 --> 19:01.096
I don't think
it goes that way.

19:01.240 --> 19:02.401
Re-ply it!

19:05.244 --> 19:06.906
Don't worry about the coffee.
It's on me.

19:06.979 --> 19:07.969
Yeah, I figured that.

19:08.381 --> 19:12.785
Michael, I am so happy
that we were able to
have this little chat.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.413
Wait.

19:17.023 --> 19:18.082
You forgetting something?

19:18.524 --> 19:19.685
What?
This chat.

19:21.027 --> 19:23.121
Two men.
One white. One Latino.

19:23.729 --> 19:26.597
A boss and a money cruncher.
I could fire you.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.167
Fire him. No.
Show mercy.

19:29.435 --> 19:30.494
But here we are.

19:30.636 --> 19:31.899
What's your point?

19:32.038 --> 19:33.336
My point is

19:35.474 --> 19:41.141
that as long as
people like you and me
don't stop talking,

19:41.247 --> 19:43.273
nobody can stop the U.S.A.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.476
Yeah, go, girl.
Right. Yes.

19:45.551 --> 19:49.921
I am talking about freedom,
about choice.

19:49.989 --> 19:51.753
America...

19:51.824 --> 19:53.690
I don't think
you need to worry,

19:53.826 --> 19:55.692
because if you want to
beat China, you will.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.860
If you don't, that's fine.

19:58.464 --> 20:01.798
That, my friend,
is your victory.

20:02.301 --> 20:05.703
You know,
a lot of people say that

20:05.771 --> 20:07.433
if you dig long
enough and hard enough,

20:07.506 --> 20:09.668
you will get to China,
and that may be true,

20:10.009 --> 20:11.500
but what they
don't tell you is that

20:11.577 --> 20:16.277
if you dig long
enough and hard enough
in a conversation,

20:16.348 --> 20:17.680
you get to a friend.

20:20.086 --> 20:22.521
So, here is to conversation.

20:22.655 --> 20:23.645
That's not...

20:23.723 --> 20:26.454
Raise your cups
on high.

20:26.525 --> 20:28.460
Case closed.
Yeah!

20:30.229 --> 20:33.529
That wasn't what we were...
That wasn't the whole...

20:33.899 --> 20:36.926
They say the best vampires
don't bleed their victims dry,

20:37.002 --> 20:39.267
but give them the strength
so that they can bounce back,

20:39.338 --> 20:40.465
only to be fed on again.

20:40.973 --> 20:43.238
<i>I spared Pam,</i>
<i>and I might feast</i>

20:43.375 --> 20:45.674
<i>off of her profits</i>
<i>for years to come.</i>

20:45.745 --> 20:48.909
<i>I let Pam win.</i>

20:50.416 --> 20:53.648
<i>I was not</i>
<i>motivated by compassion.</i>

20:53.753 --> 20:56.222
<i>I have no compassion.</i>

20:56.288 --> 21:01.386
<i>Make sure you got that.</i>
<i>"Not motivated by compassion."</i>

21:09.702 --> 21:13.298
"Come to parking lot.
Crazy pigeon action."

21:19.278 --> 21:20.302
Shh.

21:20.379 --> 21:21.870
You're gonna scare them away.

21:28.487 --> 21:30.422
That's a text.
Yeah, right?

21:31.157 --> 21:32.523
That's your new standard.
