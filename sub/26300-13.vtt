WEBVTT

00:00.976 --> 00:02.469
Last time on Star...

00:02.494 --> 00:03.968
You dance like a gringo now.

00:03.993 --> 00:05.741
There's a video of
GiGi and her aunt doing drugs

00:05.765 --> 00:07.290
- that's going viral.
- Alex, please tell me

00:07.314 --> 00:09.804
- you ain't put this video out.
- No, no, I didn't do this.

00:09.829 --> 00:12.269
- I don't even want to see you no more.
- GiGi, don't do this.

00:14.094 --> 00:15.606
Look, what I do want to talk about

00:15.630 --> 00:16.809
is taking Xander out.

00:16.855 --> 00:19.727
That's his guy Stephen
collecting suitcases from Mateo.

00:19.752 --> 00:21.850
Me and Carlotta's little boy,

00:21.852 --> 00:23.275
he never died.

00:23.300 --> 00:26.198
The first American
Sound Award nomination:

00:26.223 --> 00:28.125
Noah Brooks and Alex Crane!

00:28.150 --> 00:30.579
Best Pop Album:

00:30.604 --> 00:33.750
TAKE 3 for 3:31!

00:33.775 --> 00:35.124
When Star hears about the nomination,

00:35.148 --> 00:38.230
she's gonna explode.

00:38.255 --> 00:39.434
Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:39.436 --> 00:41.476
I just got on good terms with Carlotta.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074

00:50.307 --> 00:51.822
I've been wanting you
since I first saw you.

00:51.846 --> 00:53.100
Not as much as I have.

00:54.993 --> 00:57.806
Yes. Yes!

01:00.962 --> 01:02.080
Are you good?

01:02.786 --> 01:03.927
Yes.

01:03.952 --> 01:05.844
Yes, I'm... yeah, I'm agreeing with you.

01:05.869 --> 01:09.469
I think that, uh, hosting
the ASA nominee party at Karma

01:09.494 --> 01:11.009
could definitely be a game changer.

01:11.034 --> 01:12.879
I'm telling you, our numbers don't lie.

01:12.903 --> 01:14.555
We've been killing it
these past few months.

01:14.579 --> 01:15.879
Mm-hmm, and locking down the deal

01:15.881 --> 01:17.921
with Ricky Ricardo definitely paid off.

01:23.909 --> 01:25.313
Everything been okay with you?

01:25.722 --> 01:27.470
Yeah. I mean, just a lot going on.

01:27.495 --> 01:28.700
You want one?

01:29.120 --> 01:30.259
No, I'm straight.

01:30.421 --> 01:31.889
How's your pops hanging in there?

01:31.913 --> 01:34.497
Well, the bastard is still
breathing, unfortunately.

01:35.876 --> 01:37.658
You know what, I better get going.

01:37.978 --> 01:39.119
All right.

01:48.671 --> 01:51.322
Um, I got to take this.

01:51.347 --> 01:53.347
- Yeah. See you at the office.
- Okay.

01:59.208 --> 02:00.326
Hello?

02:01.622 --> 02:03.154
Thank you for hitting me back.

02:05.599 --> 02:08.357
Yeah, she would've been 15
years old when she had the baby.

02:10.973 --> 02:12.560
Her name is Carlotta Brown.

02:13.857 --> 02:15.883
GiGi's social media is down.

02:17.274 --> 02:18.391
You're worried, huh?

02:21.531 --> 02:24.337
I just know how she felt
when that video got posted.

02:24.954 --> 02:27.624
I remember when the tabloids
picked up my mom's first DUI.

02:27.649 --> 02:28.695
It sucked.

02:30.844 --> 02:33.383
You and your mom will have a lot
to discuss in therapy, you know.

02:33.407 --> 02:36.121
Oh, don't remind me. Please.

02:36.488 --> 02:38.747
I just need you here to keep me sane

02:38.772 --> 02:40.514
when she gets here next week.

02:41.056 --> 02:43.557
One of this year's
hottest ASA nominations

02:43.582 --> 02:46.340
is Noah Brooks and Alex
Crane's duet "So Sick,"

02:46.341 --> 02:49.889
which dropped earlier this year
during their brief but hot hookup.

02:50.049 --> 02:52.845
Among the nominees, "So Sick"
is the one to beat for Best...

02:55.855 --> 02:57.214
Does that still bother you?

02:59.272 --> 03:00.317
You want the truth?

03:01.241 --> 03:03.163
I mean, the thought of
y'all doing ASA press

03:03.319 --> 03:04.612
isn't too fun for me.

03:04.689 --> 03:06.206
It's not fun for me, either.

03:07.618 --> 03:08.944
It's just business.

03:09.265 --> 03:10.335
I'm not trippin'.

03:10.905 --> 03:11.921
I'm not.

03:13.098 --> 03:15.138
But I'm-a go get ready for work, okay?

03:19.662 --> 03:20.942
They were right about one thing.

03:21.232 --> 03:22.514
And what is that?

03:23.129 --> 03:24.263
You are one to beat.

03:35.446 --> 03:37.153
Hey.

03:37.155 --> 03:39.714
Well, all of this for me?

03:41.218 --> 03:43.501
I need to go away on
business more often.

03:43.503 --> 03:44.875
Yeah, right, girl.

03:44.900 --> 03:48.325
You know this for America's
favorite Caucasian jailbird.

03:48.350 --> 03:50.635
- Hey.
- Good to see you, Miss C!

03:50.660 --> 03:52.699
Hi, Mama.

03:52.724 --> 03:54.464
- Hey.
- Hey. How you doing?

03:55.052 --> 03:56.206
Ah.

03:56.208 --> 03:58.533
- Thank you so much for coming back.
- Yeah.

03:58.558 --> 04:00.271
You know I wouldn't miss
Star's first day out.

04:00.295 --> 04:02.804
Well, look, I'm about to get settled,

04:02.881 --> 04:04.838
and then I'm gonna shoot
to the office and see

04:04.863 --> 04:08.292
what Mateo's ass wants,
and then we can go get Star.

04:09.034 --> 04:11.441
Tell that Mateo "uno momento."

04:11.832 --> 04:13.859
You here to celebrate with
us, girl? C-Come on, get...

04:13.883 --> 04:16.091
♪ Star comin' home from jail ♪

04:16.117 --> 04:17.750
♪ Ow, I said ♪

04:17.776 --> 04:19.178
- ♪ Ow. ♪
- Don't do that.

04:19.197 --> 04:21.238
Whoa! Don't hurt yourself.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.105
Oh, my God.

04:30.548 --> 04:32.747
Inmate Lewis, 1455,

04:32.772 --> 04:34.572
report to the nearest officer.

04:39.805 --> 04:41.062
Help me.

05:05.560 --> 05:06.997
What the... ?

05:07.022 --> 05:08.147
Surprise.

05:09.282 --> 05:10.698
Yeah, surprise.

05:10.723 --> 05:11.990
Mmm.

05:13.760 --> 05:16.537
Mm-mm-mm. I talk to you every day,

05:16.562 --> 05:17.622
and you couldn't tell
me you was gonna be here?

05:17.646 --> 05:19.246
What if I had one of
my side chicks here?

05:19.815 --> 05:22.055
Boy, please. You're cute,
but you ain't stupid.

05:25.502 --> 05:26.743
Oh.

05:26.768 --> 05:29.175
Yeah. I told you that
boy got some lungs on him.

05:31.109 --> 05:34.854
And you're living at your
baby mama's house why again?

05:35.003 --> 05:37.296
All right, Star gets out of jail today.

05:37.443 --> 05:40.371
As soon as she comes home, we'll
be back to normal, I promise.

05:44.829 --> 05:46.754
How you holding up? Everything okay?

05:47.293 --> 05:48.593
I'm good.

05:48.618 --> 05:50.382
I'm so good, especially
now that you're back.

05:50.407 --> 05:51.507
Come on.

05:51.532 --> 05:52.921
Mm-mm-mm.

05:52.946 --> 05:54.862
Mm-mm.

05:56.558 --> 05:58.196
I think it's about that
time for you to meet him.

05:58.220 --> 05:59.302
- Okay.
- Yeah.

05:59.327 --> 06:01.160
Let's meet him.

06:10.147 --> 06:11.208
Good morning.

06:11.727 --> 06:12.750
You look so good.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.687
I still can't believe you're here.

06:16.689 --> 06:19.406
Just like I can't believe you're
still wearing your wedding ring.

06:21.311 --> 06:22.405
Come on.

06:23.491 --> 06:25.829
That's just for appearances
with my investors.

06:25.948 --> 06:28.456
Appearances?

06:28.458 --> 06:31.920
- Yeah. It's work.
- Or you're still in love.

06:32.417 --> 06:34.675
Not according to my
signed divorce papers.

06:39.273 --> 06:41.320
I'm a single man.

06:43.524 --> 06:45.716
But you're the only woman that matters.

06:45.834 --> 06:47.359
You get that?

07:07.973 --> 07:09.574
You got to be kidding me.

07:18.391 --> 07:19.408
Hello.

07:20.669 --> 07:21.848
What do you mean?

07:24.278 --> 07:25.597
All the investors?

07:28.171 --> 07:29.562
I'll be right there.

07:31.703 --> 07:34.389
I mean, every company hits a
rough patch from time to time,

07:34.414 --> 07:37.217
but we made it through, so you
have nothing to worry about.

07:37.736 --> 07:40.423
A gambling addiction is
something to worry about.

07:40.689 --> 07:43.157
I'm glad we were informed
on how you used our money

07:43.182 --> 07:44.506
to cover your debts.

07:44.718 --> 07:47.289
I can assure you and
the rest of the investors

07:47.314 --> 07:49.696
that Gravity Media is
completely above board.

07:49.815 --> 07:51.239
This isn't the first time

07:51.241 --> 07:53.297
you've been accused of unethical doings.

07:53.322 --> 07:54.871
I think we're missing
the bigger picture here.

07:54.895 --> 07:56.956
Gravity Records has been nominated

07:57.372 --> 07:59.831
for several ASAs, which
we are fighting to win.

07:59.856 --> 08:02.261
And when we do, the
notoriety and the money

08:02.286 --> 08:03.409
that comes along with that,

08:03.487 --> 08:05.223
it'll easily cover your investments.

08:05.247 --> 08:08.308
We like you, Carlotta,
but not enough to risk

08:08.333 --> 08:10.120
millions of our dollars
on a rancid gambler.

08:11.026 --> 08:13.744
Mr. Ferrera, consider this
your notice of divestiture.

08:13.769 --> 08:14.925
Sure you want to do this?

08:14.950 --> 08:16.348
'Cause I don't want
you to come back to me

08:16.372 --> 08:18.831
begging like a dog when
I turn this around.

08:23.165 --> 08:25.885
Honestly, we're more conservative.

08:26.819 --> 08:29.379
Gambling? What the
hell is wrong with you?

08:29.404 --> 08:30.769
I'm losing everything.

08:31.855 --> 08:33.605
Well, don't lose your focus.

08:35.284 --> 08:37.626
I mean, so what, we lost these
investors, but you're right.

08:37.629 --> 08:39.541
If one of our artists
brings back an ASA,

08:39.565 --> 08:41.392
they will come crawling back.

08:41.951 --> 08:43.707
Without their money,
our doors will be closed

08:43.732 --> 08:45.460
before we even reach the ASAs.

08:45.579 --> 08:47.739
Okay, this day just
keeps on getting better.

08:50.048 --> 08:52.277
We're just gonna have to come
up with a way for Gravity Media

08:52.301 --> 08:54.205
to maximize this nomination party.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.139
Excuse me.

08:59.518 --> 09:01.518
Yeah, Simone. I'm in a
meeting. Can I call you...

09:02.928 --> 09:03.963
What?

09:06.576 --> 09:09.285
Oh, my God. Okay. All
right, I'm-I'm on my way.

09:09.310 --> 09:11.203
I got to go. It's Star.

09:18.405 --> 09:19.669
Any update?

09:20.218 --> 09:22.057
- What's going on?
- No, nothing.

09:22.082 --> 09:23.549
All we know is that
someone attacked Star

09:23.573 --> 09:25.026
and tried to leave her for dead.

09:26.159 --> 09:28.165
Are you all here for Star Davis?

09:28.190 --> 09:29.299
- Yeah.
- Yes.

09:29.323 --> 09:31.073
I'm her sister. What's
happening right now?

09:31.075 --> 09:32.726
Due to the blunt force trauma,

09:32.751 --> 09:34.412
Star has intercranial hypertension.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.744
- Swelling of the brain.
- Oh, my God.

09:36.746 --> 09:38.683
Our plan is to heavily sedate her

09:38.707 --> 09:40.415
into a medically induced coma.

09:40.442 --> 09:43.176
We have to give the brain time
to heal and reduce swelling.

09:43.237 --> 09:45.800
- A coma?
- This is unbelievable.

09:45.825 --> 09:47.207
Okay, well, can we go see her?

09:47.232 --> 09:48.640
I'm sorry, not at this time.

09:48.642 --> 09:50.951
We need a few hours to stabilize her.

09:54.899 --> 09:55.942
Okay.

09:55.967 --> 09:57.216
- Okay.
- It's okay. She's gonna be all right.

09:57.218 --> 09:58.297
- No.
- She's gonna be okay.

09:58.321 --> 10:00.746
- No, I need to see my sister.
- No, Simone, look.

10:00.771 --> 10:01.850
You have got to stay calm, okay?

10:01.874 --> 10:03.920
- You got to stay positive.
- Star is a fighter.

10:03.944 --> 10:05.801
Baby, she's not leaving us or that baby.

10:05.826 --> 10:07.409
Y'all don't know that.

10:07.486 --> 10:10.028
- Okay? I got to do something.
- Simone. Simone.

10:10.189 --> 10:13.682
Hi. I called earlier about
a patient, Carlotta Brown.

10:14.001 --> 10:16.188
Yeah, you confirmed
the birth of a baby boy,

10:16.213 --> 10:19.219
but I would like to check to see
if there's a death certificate

10:19.852 --> 10:21.032
on file as well.

10:21.779 --> 10:23.099
Okay, sure, I'll hold.

10:26.947 --> 10:28.914
It's time to teach you a lesson.

10:29.033 --> 10:30.398
That's right.

10:32.362 --> 10:33.694
Breathe, baby.

10:38.802 --> 10:41.585
Dr. Sheldon, please report
to Neural Diagnostics.

10:41.610 --> 10:44.069
Dr. Sheldon, please report
to Neural Diagnostics.

10:44.523 --> 10:47.179
You know, Simone,
you can't shut everybody out.

10:47.809 --> 10:50.796
We got to be strong for Star and Davis.

10:52.086 --> 10:53.660
I can't lose my sister.

10:54.233 --> 10:56.259
You are not gonna lose your sister.

10:57.079 --> 10:58.699
God is already doing the hard part.

10:59.969 --> 11:01.569
All we got to do is wait.

11:04.510 --> 11:06.394
Okay.

11:11.045 --> 11:12.240
Look, you got to go.

11:12.505 --> 11:13.588
No, I don't.

11:13.911 --> 11:15.094
Yes, you do, Miss C.

11:16.412 --> 11:17.713
I'll fight for Star over here.

11:18.205 --> 11:20.290
You just make sure she
walks out of this hospital

11:20.292 --> 11:22.010
and straight onto that ASA stage.

11:29.988 --> 11:32.722
Well, you call me if you need me.

11:32.747 --> 11:33.913
Do not hesitate.

11:35.045 --> 11:36.123
I promise.

11:37.134 --> 11:38.511
All right, baby.

11:44.875 --> 11:47.174
Them doctors want to put Star in a coma.

11:47.814 --> 11:50.041
They feel like that's the
best option for her right now.

11:52.451 --> 11:54.531
I can't believe this has happened.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.921
Look, all we can do is just pray.

11:57.172 --> 11:59.513
'Cause you-you being a
single dad... that's a lot.

11:59.538 --> 12:00.844
That's a lot of pressure.

12:02.780 --> 12:04.610
Between that and the ASAs,

12:05.496 --> 12:07.271
don't need you having no damn setback.

12:08.096 --> 12:10.010
You think you might need
to go to an AA meeting?

12:10.622 --> 12:12.214
No. Come on, man. I'm...

12:12.963 --> 12:13.994
I ain't gonna slip.

12:14.019 --> 12:15.079
Trust me.

12:17.157 --> 12:18.341
My son needs me.

12:21.206 --> 12:22.363
Okay, listen up.

12:22.388 --> 12:23.854
Mateo and I decided to make

12:23.867 --> 12:27.022
Gravity's ASA nomination
party a ticketed event.

12:27.047 --> 12:29.774
Open it up to the public,
pull out all the stops.

12:30.047 --> 12:31.710
But what about the ASA voters?

12:31.735 --> 12:33.178
Well, we still need to woo them,

12:33.203 --> 12:35.350
but we got to make some money, too.

12:35.375 --> 12:37.907
So, I need y'all to be on point.

12:37.932 --> 12:41.091
Does this mean I'm
singing Take 3's nominated song alone?

12:41.093 --> 12:43.590
Just 'cause if I am, I
got to rearrange my vocals.

12:43.615 --> 12:46.299
Actually, you and Noah are
gonna be performing "So Sick."

12:47.285 --> 12:49.633
Uh, Carlotta... Noah, I'm sorry.

12:49.658 --> 12:52.214
I'm cool with us doing
press together. I just...

12:52.239 --> 12:55.680
I know this is unprofessional,
and it's on me, but Derek still

12:55.705 --> 12:57.495
feels a way about what
happened last year...

12:57.519 --> 12:59.753
Can I leave now? I
don't have time to listen

12:59.778 --> 13:03.255
to this raggedy-ass ho complain
about her silver spoon problems.

13:03.280 --> 13:05.426
Can you stop fighting me?

13:05.451 --> 13:07.594
I can't stop doing a damn thing.

13:07.619 --> 13:10.028
But if you don't want to
perform, that's on you.

13:10.147 --> 13:13.240
Leave it to the
professionals. I'm out of here.

13:15.148 --> 13:16.556
She really hates your ass.

13:16.581 --> 13:19.596
She just lost her aunt.
Anybody could get it.

13:20.965 --> 13:22.182
Don't take it personal.

13:24.038 --> 13:25.248
Okay.

13:27.681 --> 13:28.694
You check it in!

13:28.719 --> 13:30.927
Don't make me ask you
again! You hear me?!

13:31.157 --> 13:32.573
Huh?

13:33.053 --> 13:34.377
Deaf or something?!

13:34.402 --> 13:35.967
What the hell are
you... ? Get off of her.

13:35.991 --> 13:37.075
What the... ?!

13:38.634 --> 13:39.725
Cotton.

13:41.812 --> 13:43.088
Baby girl, you miss Daddy?

13:43.113 --> 13:44.792
I'm not your baby girl anymore.

13:45.706 --> 13:47.120
Dior's one of my gals.

13:47.352 --> 13:49.385
She's a unicorn, just like you.

13:49.410 --> 13:50.668
Give me my money, Daddy.

13:51.079 --> 13:52.738
Give her her money, Leon.

13:56.376 --> 13:57.817
Here, take the money.

13:58.095 --> 14:00.799
Get out of here and
don't let me see you again.

14:00.823 --> 14:02.640
You know you owe me everything, right?

14:04.392 --> 14:06.226
You forget I'm the one
that named you Cotton

14:06.251 --> 14:08.251
- in the first place.
- Get off of me.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.292
You better get the hell out of here.

14:14.237 --> 14:15.746
I'm gonna pay you back for this.

14:17.706 --> 14:18.915
Trust.

14:30.335 --> 14:33.033
Whatever you do with your
body is your business,

14:33.058 --> 14:34.912
but you don't want to mess with Leon.

14:38.224 --> 14:39.374
Thank you.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.239
Cassie?

14:46.888 --> 14:48.748
Why you not answering your buzzer?

14:49.621 --> 14:52.489
I got to talk to you about
this ASA party at Karma.

14:54.034 --> 14:55.184
Cassie?

14:58.142 --> 14:59.282
Cassie?

15:01.017 --> 15:03.282
Cassie? Oh, my God.

15:03.315 --> 15:05.448
Cassie! You okay?

15:05.919 --> 15:07.146
Who did this?

15:08.255 --> 15:09.310
Xander.

15:09.335 --> 15:12.091
He plotted something
to double-cross Mateo,

15:12.116 --> 15:14.602
and I knew it would hurt you,
and I couldn't let that happen.

15:15.834 --> 15:18.000
He ain't gonna stop
until he tears me down.

15:18.160 --> 15:21.071
- It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
- I'm so tired.

15:21.096 --> 15:22.287
It's okay, sis.

15:23.028 --> 15:24.045
It's all right.

15:25.431 --> 15:26.840
I got it from here.

15:28.076 --> 15:29.259
Okay?

15:32.208 --> 15:33.750
I'm-a kill his ass.

15:48.834 --> 15:50.185
I had to see her for myself.

15:53.443 --> 15:54.593
How's she doing?

15:54.811 --> 15:55.945
Sleeping.

15:56.787 --> 15:58.454
She been like that for hours.

16:01.804 --> 16:03.030
How's Davis?

16:04.226 --> 16:06.694
He's, um... he's good.

16:06.995 --> 16:08.447
He's in the waiting room with Megan.

16:10.095 --> 16:11.345
I'll let y'all have a moment.

16:27.823 --> 16:29.775
I never thought I'd say this, but...

16:31.772 --> 16:33.180
I miss your crazy ass.

16:33.811 --> 16:35.344
You're like the toughest girl I know.

16:46.305 --> 16:49.001
You know, you're the only one
I can show the ugliest parts of me to.

16:51.470 --> 16:52.968
Right now, Star, I'm struggling.

16:54.263 --> 16:55.966
Between Davis, the music,

16:56.211 --> 16:57.651
all these new pressures, I just...

16:57.918 --> 16:59.878
It's like I got to be
everything to everybody...

17:01.889 --> 17:03.464
... when actually I feel like nothing.

17:05.208 --> 17:07.127
I'm trying to be everything
Davis needs, but...

17:08.047 --> 17:09.954
I need you to wake up

17:10.152 --> 17:11.711
and tell me if I'm doing this right.

17:16.077 --> 17:17.877
I'm-a hold it down no
matter what, you know.

17:20.337 --> 17:21.827
No matter what, Stunt Queen.

17:28.319 --> 17:29.826
Just promise me you'll wake up.

17:33.785 --> 17:34.918
Any better?

17:35.769 --> 17:36.902
Yeah.

17:37.714 --> 17:38.913
Lot better.

17:39.215 --> 17:41.975
I still can't believe Mateo
was caught up in Xander's dirt.

17:45.638 --> 17:47.400
Lottie, can you please handle Maurice?

17:47.425 --> 17:49.043
I don't want him to see me like this.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.269
Hmm. Give me the phone.

17:53.096 --> 17:54.212
What?

17:54.628 --> 17:55.738
Oh. Hey, Carlotta.

17:55.973 --> 17:57.745
I'm here to see Cassie.
Can you buzz me up?

17:58.025 --> 18:00.337
Nah, I can't buzz you up right now.
She kind of tied up.

18:00.362 --> 18:01.447
What you want?

18:01.472 --> 18:04.041
To go over the new plans for
the ASA party with Cassie.

18:04.066 --> 18:06.549
Just e-mail it to her. I'll
make sure she takes a look at it.

18:06.574 --> 18:07.998
Is everything okay?

18:08.023 --> 18:09.385
- We're fine.
- Go ahead, boy.

18:09.409 --> 18:11.192
- I'll call you later.
- Just go.

18:11.355 --> 18:12.616
- Carlotta...
- Bye.

18:16.336 --> 18:18.545
But you know you can't
hide in here forever.

18:19.465 --> 18:20.848
That way Xander wins.

18:21.496 --> 18:24.147
Yeah. Lottie, honestly, I just...

18:25.178 --> 18:27.262
feel like I need some time alone.

18:30.582 --> 18:31.998
All right.

18:36.708 --> 18:37.983
But you just remember,

18:39.643 --> 18:41.426
you built this life for yourself.

18:41.926 --> 18:43.204
You went legit.

18:44.801 --> 18:47.176
Now, we both know how hard
that is in this family.

18:49.211 --> 18:50.627
Yeah.

18:50.652 --> 18:51.861
Keep fighting.

18:52.841 --> 18:55.175
Don't let Xander take
that away from you.

19:06.268 --> 19:08.944
Look who came to see you.

19:10.725 --> 19:11.999
Davis.

19:15.773 --> 19:16.898
Say hi to your mama.

19:18.323 --> 19:19.695
Yeah, there she is.

19:20.183 --> 19:22.801
We have to fight for
her, 'cause she can't.

Xander McPherson. I know
you're doing business with him.

21:12.871 --> 21:14.392
Are you out of your damn mind?

21:15.166 --> 21:17.551
Carlotta, you got to
trust me, all right?

21:17.576 --> 21:19.897
I know what I'm doing. I
got everything under control.

21:19.922 --> 21:21.491
You can't control X.

21:21.516 --> 21:23.866
He is a monster. A virus.

21:24.140 --> 21:26.235
I've watched him ruin
people's lives for years.

21:26.259 --> 21:28.468
Carlotta, they were gonna
shut down Gravity Media.

21:28.493 --> 21:31.145
I needed an investor.
He came out of the blue.

21:31.170 --> 21:32.279
That's why I did it.

21:32.969 --> 21:35.461
That bastard set you up
so he could get to me.

21:35.486 --> 21:37.034
What do you mean by that?

21:37.059 --> 21:39.162
Xander got a long
history with my family.

21:40.604 --> 21:42.532
Well, he threatened my family.

21:43.406 --> 21:44.687
And I'm about to lose it all.

21:44.712 --> 21:47.476
My business, my reputation, everything.

21:48.765 --> 21:49.891
What you need to do...

21:52.129 --> 21:53.793
is get back to your roots.

21:54.629 --> 21:56.230
Trusting your instincts.

21:56.260 --> 21:57.844
That's what got you here.

22:15.721 --> 22:18.170
What are you doing here?

22:19.935 --> 22:21.209
I heard what happened to Star.

22:21.498 --> 22:22.761
I wanted to come check on you.

22:22.786 --> 22:24.068
How is she holding up?

22:24.093 --> 22:25.543
I mean, you know her.

22:25.851 --> 22:26.957
She's a fighter.

22:27.216 --> 22:29.734
- Yeah.
- I'm praying for her.

22:31.780 --> 22:34.779
Look, I know this Noah
duet throws you off.

22:34.804 --> 22:36.264
Look, the whole reason
you moved from New York

22:36.288 --> 22:37.521
was to follow your dreams.

22:39.408 --> 22:41.168
I'll be damned if I
get in the way of that.

22:43.482 --> 22:45.562
I'm-a marry you one
day, Alexandra Crane.

22:47.540 --> 22:49.575
After all this crazy is over with.

22:55.661 --> 22:57.013
I'm gonna let you get back to it.

22:57.038 --> 22:58.196
'Kay.

23:08.911 --> 23:10.309
How'd you get up here?

23:10.334 --> 23:11.959
Look, I'm not here as
one of your coworkers,

23:11.983 --> 23:13.374
I'm here as your friend.

23:13.399 --> 23:15.641
Something I know you
ain't never had before.

23:26.778 --> 23:27.963
Did he do this to you?

23:30.055 --> 23:31.986
I ain't want you to see me like this.

23:34.917 --> 23:36.536
You know, I can't believe how many times

23:36.561 --> 23:38.148
I let that man beat me.

23:38.952 --> 23:40.853
Like I'm some weak-ass bitch.

23:41.628 --> 23:45.655
Anybody that puts their hands
on a woman ain't a man, trust me.

23:45.680 --> 23:47.292
And don't ever let me
hear you say you're weak.

23:47.316 --> 23:48.633
I know how strong you are.

23:49.227 --> 23:51.541
Now, Xander got you feeling
like you ain't enough.

23:51.566 --> 23:54.551
Cassie, I'm here to
tell you, you are enough.

23:55.562 --> 23:58.111
As long as I'm around he'll
never lay hands on you again.

23:58.948 --> 24:00.831
I promise you that.

24:04.977 --> 24:06.511
Thank you.

24:38.502 --> 24:40.161
Oh, come on, Pops.

24:42.813 --> 24:44.166
You've reached Bobby.

24:44.190 --> 24:45.290
Leave a message.

24:48.477 --> 24:50.545
I know, I know, I know. I got you.

24:51.164 --> 24:52.656
I got you.

24:55.539 --> 24:57.656
It's okay, we got through that.

24:58.221 --> 24:59.712
We got through that.

24:59.739 --> 25:01.914
Shh.

25:40.259 --> 25:42.826
And just heal her, Lord,
and bring her home to us.

25:43.532 --> 25:45.783
In Jesus's name, amen.

25:45.944 --> 25:47.227
Amen.

25:49.848 --> 25:51.089
I don't get it. How do you pray

25:51.114 --> 25:53.564
to a God that would even
allow her to be in that bed?

25:55.103 --> 25:56.252
It's the same God

25:56.277 --> 25:58.275
that allowed Derek to
get up out that chair.

25:59.465 --> 26:03.624
The same God that kept
you through a plane crash.

26:08.015 --> 26:10.646
The same God that gives
us chance after chance.

26:11.842 --> 26:13.692
We just got to reach
out there and grab 'em.

26:14.326 --> 26:16.471
Because life can change
in the blink of an eye,

26:16.496 --> 26:20.264
so you got to go for
what you want. Today.

26:21.094 --> 26:22.469
Ain't no point in waiting.

26:49.074 --> 26:53.051
You know, when I was looking
at Star in that hospital bed,

26:54.272 --> 26:55.937
I thought about you and Xander.

26:56.779 --> 26:58.596
That could be your ass laying there.

26:59.074 --> 27:01.190
He will never lay hands on me again.

27:01.215 --> 27:03.596
Yeah, until he come up

27:03.621 --> 27:05.958
with some clever little words
and you forgive him again.

27:06.457 --> 27:07.574
Not this time.

27:08.418 --> 27:11.312
Look, I'm really ready to start
the next chapter in my life.

27:12.245 --> 27:15.062
And I can't do that constantly
looking over my damn shoulder.

27:15.545 --> 27:16.643
So what you gonna do?

27:16.668 --> 27:17.784
Confront him.

27:18.494 --> 27:21.217
You name the time and the place

27:22.444 --> 27:23.545
and I'll be there.

27:25.538 --> 27:26.835
I will.

27:29.180 --> 27:30.406
I promise.

27:36.206 --> 27:38.553

27:38.578 --> 27:39.994

from Gravity coming out?

28:19.226 --> 28:20.733
Someone looks happy.

28:20.758 --> 28:23.328
Well, I just locked down a
deal with the Jaramillo brothers

28:23.353 --> 28:25.170
as prime investors in Gravity Media.

28:25.195 --> 28:26.693

28:26.718 --> 28:28.510
Alex, looking good.

28:28.535 --> 28:31.186
- You know what, I was talking today to Carlotta.
- Yeah?

28:31.211 --> 28:34.289
She reminded me that sometimes
you have to stop outsourcing

28:34.314 --> 28:36.489
- and go back to my roots.
- Oh.

28:36.514 --> 28:37.997

28:38.170 --> 28:39.278
She is.

28:39.987 --> 28:41.899

need to celebrate, right?

40:24.146 --> 40:25.550
I can't believe you did all this.

40:30.902 --> 40:32.503
Derek, I love you.

40:32.621 --> 40:34.679
And I don't want to
waste another moment.

40:35.249 --> 40:36.632
I have everything with you.

40:36.657 --> 40:37.897
And, over these past few days,

40:37.922 --> 40:39.509
I've been watching
Star fight for her life

40:39.533 --> 40:41.125
and GiGi hurt.

40:43.214 --> 40:46.675
I realized that I don't want
to take anything for granted.

40:47.527 --> 40:49.205
Baby, you have a lot on your shoulders.

40:49.229 --> 40:50.653
You don't have to prove
anything to me, okay?

40:50.677 --> 40:52.226
I can't focus on that.

40:52.683 --> 40:55.347
This is about everything
you've been to me,

40:56.816 --> 40:58.045
for me,

40:58.047 --> 40:59.347
since the day I met you.

41:00.132 --> 41:01.350
I love you, too.

41:07.130 --> 41:08.907
This isn't the only surprise.

41:10.942 --> 41:12.052
I...

41:20.778 --> 41:22.978
I don't want to wait
for the crazy to be over,

41:23.013 --> 41:24.880
'cause it'll never be over.

41:24.882 --> 41:26.756
You've always been right there.

41:26.875 --> 41:28.652
And I want that forever.

41:33.365 --> 41:35.441
Derek, will you marry me?

41:39.947 --> 41:42.680
From the first day I met
you and laid eyes on you,

41:42.705 --> 41:44.706
I knew I would be with you
for the rest of my life.

41:46.845 --> 41:48.339
So, is that a yes, because...

41:48.363 --> 41:49.757
- I want to hear it.
- Yes. Yeah.

42:06.841 --> 42:07.909
Where you been?

42:08.628 --> 42:09.839
I've been trying to call you.

42:10.511 --> 42:12.292
Take them damn glasses off.

42:14.488 --> 42:16.108
You went to see X
without me, didn't you?

42:25.497 --> 42:26.887
All right, whatever happened...

42:28.684 --> 42:29.786
it's over.

42:31.949 --> 42:33.043
For me.

42:34.619 --> 42:35.653
But not for you.

42:37.051 --> 42:38.482
Xander was my devil,

42:40.006 --> 42:41.561
but Calvin is yours.

42:44.842 --> 42:46.186
We ain't got to talk about him.

42:46.188 --> 42:47.601
No, we have to talk about it.

42:48.007 --> 42:49.476
He told me about your son.

42:49.911 --> 42:51.484
The baby that you had with Daddy

42:52.511 --> 42:53.694
is alive.

42:58.976 --> 43:00.901
This is what I found.
