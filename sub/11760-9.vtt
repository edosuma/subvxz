00:06.000 --> 00:12.074

00:20.180 --> 00:21.600
Emmett!

00:33.580 --> 00:35.380
Emmett?

01:12.040 --> 01:13.300
<i>Mrs Reid?</i>

01:14.340 --> 01:15.440
Mrs Reid.

01:15.990 --> 01:17.180
There's so much blood.

01:17.680 --> 01:19.850
Your husband was already dead
when you found him?

01:20.320 --> 01:21.730
It killed him.

01:22.540 --> 01:24.230
- "It"?
- The poltergeist.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.000
It's in the house.

01:26.270 --> 01:27.970
So you're saying
an evil spirit...

01:29.040 --> 01:31.780
pinned your husband
to the wall with swords?

01:31.870 --> 01:32.840
Yes.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.150
And you didn't hear anything?

01:36.080 --> 01:38.000
I've been...

01:38.430 --> 01:40.460
taking a tonic to help me sleep.

01:42.850 --> 01:45.240
Why didn't the poltergeist
kill you, too?

01:46.620 --> 01:48.320
I don't... I don't know.

01:48.970 --> 01:49.940
I do.

01:51.380 --> 01:53.740
Because there is
no poltergeist, Mrs Reid.

01:53.900 --> 01:55.619
- You killed your husband.
- No.

01:55.620 --> 01:57.348
You're under arrest
on the charge of murder.

02:08.685 --> 02:10.021
Seasick already?

02:10.460 --> 02:12.011
Six more days to go.

02:12.217 --> 02:14.180
This is why I've never
been to America.

02:14.320 --> 02:15.977
Buffalo's on the way
to Falcroft Manor.

02:16.022 --> 02:17.245
We should stop there first.

02:17.965 --> 02:20.537
Mr Walbridge hasn't responded
to any of my telegrams.

02:21.340 --> 02:23.360
Once we arrive at his shop,
he'll have to explain

02:23.420 --> 02:25.900
why Benjamin contacted him
about buying firearms.

02:26.140 --> 02:28.340
You deserve answers
about your husband's murder.

02:28.540 --> 02:29.725
And I'll get them...

02:30.080 --> 02:32.940
but right now, Mrs Reid's case
should be our first priority.

02:34.160 --> 02:35.520
Where have you been?

02:35.931 --> 02:37.405
Cargo hold.

02:40.822 --> 02:43.100
Your mother would be happy
you're bringing her home.

02:43.657 --> 02:45.954
Are you sure you don't
want us to come to the funeral?

02:46.262 --> 02:49.360
I'll be fine. Thanks.
And you guys have a new case.

02:49.520 --> 02:51.291
In my absence, your job is

02:51.330 --> 02:53.451
to discredit every theory
he comes up with.

02:53.660 --> 02:54.731
I'll do my best.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.285
The original owners
of the house,

02:56.331 --> 02:58.845
the Turner family,
all died tragically there.

02:59.337 --> 03:01.965
That's compelling evidence
that Falcroft Manor is haunted.

03:02.022 --> 03:04.205
Thomas Edison wouldn't be
participating otherwise.

03:04.331 --> 03:06.708
Might I suggest Edison
is a liar and a cheat?

03:06.822 --> 03:09.862
Insult the greatest scientific mind
of our generation?

03:09.920 --> 03:12.800
The title Tesla would have
if Edison wasn't a liar and a cheat.

03:12.980 --> 03:15.131
He's friends with Tesla.

03:15.180 --> 03:17.520
Edison didn't need Tesla
to develop a device

03:17.588 --> 03:19.010
to communicate with the dead.

03:19.140 --> 03:20.948
My shoe does the same thing.

03:21.650 --> 03:22.909
There's just as much proof

03:22.930 --> 03:24.579
that Edison's Necrophone does anything.

03:24.580 --> 03:27.580
- He claims he's heard voices.
- In his head.

03:28.480 --> 03:30.734
You have to admit, such a device
would be revolutionary.

03:30.770 --> 03:32.610
To be able to talk to
loved ones you've lost.

03:38.080 --> 03:40.610
It could also save
a woman from execution.

03:43.745 --> 03:45.389
Thank you so much
for helping me.

03:45.420 --> 03:48.029
_
- DOYLE: We haven't done anything yet.

03:49.061 --> 03:51.716
It wasn't the first time
I experienced something strange.

03:52.580 --> 03:55.483
Another time,
I woke up and the room was ice cold.

03:55.883 --> 03:59.220
<i>I wanted to get another blanket,
but I couldn't move.</i>

03:59.250 --> 04:01.178
<i>I felt like something
was pinning me to the bed.</i>

04:02.140 --> 04:03.840
<i>So, I tried to scream...</i>

04:03.912 --> 04:05.578
but I had no voice.

04:07.345 --> 04:09.061
And then, all of a sudden,
it just stopped.

04:09.680 --> 04:11.300
I read about something similar...

04:12.940 --> 04:14.050
in a medical journal.

04:14.580 --> 04:16.800
A state between wakefulness and sleep,

04:16.850 --> 04:19.200
where people experience
a type of paralysis.

04:19.589 --> 04:23.020
There was an evil presence
in that room. I could feel it.

04:24.920 --> 04:26.290
Mrs Reid...

04:27.470 --> 04:30.200
I understand you recently
lost your son, Maxwell.

04:30.420 --> 04:33.230
Please accept our deepest
condolences.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.670
Was there anything unusual
in the manner of his death?

04:36.030 --> 04:36.940
No.

04:37.920 --> 04:41.500
No, he died of influenza
just... a month old.

04:43.510 --> 04:46.413
Constable McKellar said
that a few months ago,

04:46.533 --> 04:49.666
your husband struck you
quite violently

04:49.780 --> 04:51.240
in front of several witnesses.

04:51.533 --> 04:54.066
<i>If a man is willing to do that
to his wife in public,</i>

04:54.140 --> 04:56.660
one can only imagine what goes on
behind closed doors.

04:56.680 --> 04:57.853
<i>Emmett had a temper.</i>

04:57.986 --> 04:59.740
I should've known better
than to argue with him.

04:59.853 --> 05:02.460
- He had no right to strike you.
- I was his wife.

05:03.760 --> 05:05.420
He could do as he pleased.

05:09.900 --> 05:12.613
Clara, I've met other women
in your position.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.853
Victimised by their husbands.

05:16.640 --> 05:20.026
Sometimes it seems like killing
is the only way out.

05:27.300 --> 05:29.800
I did not kill Emmett.

05:30.420 --> 05:33.140
I swear to you, it was a poltergeist.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.293
<i>Dr Doyle and Constable Stratton.</i>

05:40.386 --> 05:43.613
Roland Carson.
Thank you so much for coming.

05:43.720 --> 05:46.640
When Mrs Reid's lawyer contacted me,
I knew I was in over my head. I mean,

05:46.786 --> 05:49.640
I'm an amateur paranormal
investigator, yes,

05:49.733 --> 05:51.973
but you've actually
investigated the paranormal.

05:52.013 --> 05:54.266
- You've solved crimes.
- We're happy to be of assistance.

05:54.540 --> 05:57.906
May I introduce Millie Pasternak?
She's an empath from Toronto.

05:58.380 --> 06:00.860
- A medium?
- Not exactly.

06:00.880 --> 06:03.333
I feel the emotions of other people,

06:03.742 --> 06:05.511
including those who have passed.

06:06.684 --> 06:09.653
- And this is...
- A man who needs no introduction.

06:09.680 --> 06:11.300
It's an honour, Mr Edison.

06:12.044 --> 06:14.515
You were the inspiration for a
character in one of my stories.

06:14.648 --> 06:17.020
Mr Hatherley in The Adventure
Of The Engineer's Thumb.

06:17.075 --> 06:18.551
I don't have much time for fiction.

06:19.600 --> 06:22.604
As you can imagine,
Mr Edison is a very busy man.

06:22.666 --> 06:25.540
I am Rustom Avari,
Mr Edison's assistant.

06:25.706 --> 06:26.888
Pleased to meet you.

06:27.555 --> 06:29.662
What can you tell us
about the Turner family?

06:29.706 --> 06:31.140
The home's previous owners.

06:31.360 --> 06:33.940
The police were not
very forthcoming with details.

06:34.280 --> 06:35.353
Yes, well,

06:36.327 --> 06:40.140
ten years ago,
Mr Turner went... on a rampage.

06:40.749 --> 06:41.660
No, please!

06:43.803 --> 06:46.300
Then he went upstairs
to where his two sons were sleeping.

06:49.860 --> 06:51.173
The Turners' young daughter

06:51.840 --> 06:54.320
<i>tried to barricade the door
with a chair.</i>

07:11.613 --> 07:14.146
Then Mr Turner
took his own life.

07:14.706 --> 07:16.773
He jumped off the cliff
at the edge of the property.

07:19.740 --> 07:20.893
<i>Now, I think...</i>

07:20.960 --> 07:23.640
that Mr Turner's spirit...

07:23.740 --> 07:25.306
is what killed Mr Reid.

07:28.300 --> 07:31.700
I...can feel their pain.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.900
Those poor people.

07:35.826 --> 07:38.693
Hopefully, we'll be able to make
contact through the Necrophone.

07:39.466 --> 07:43.373
We are quite excited
to see this remarkable device.

07:43.426 --> 07:44.940
I'm sure you are.

07:51.900 --> 07:54.460
Ha ha ha!

07:54.826 --> 07:56.220
Marvellous. How does it work?

07:56.266 --> 07:58.360
It's quite complicated.

08:01.226 --> 08:05.013
Ahem. Erm...electromagnetic waves.

08:05.133 --> 08:06.939
When Marconi stumbled upon the radio,

08:06.940 --> 08:09.820
he reported hearing
anomalous sounds and voices.

08:09.893 --> 08:11.740
And you believe
those were spirits?

08:11.773 --> 08:13.419
If we can find the right frequency,

08:13.420 --> 08:16.100
I believe we can open
the door to the other side.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.659
It was my understanding
you had already made contact.

08:18.660 --> 08:21.413
I did. I did. However, I was
unable to replicate my results.

08:21.460 --> 08:22.786
But I will. I'm determined...

08:23.053 --> 08:25.050
to put a Necrophone in every home.

08:25.140 --> 08:27.040
Do you really
think that's wise?

08:27.640 --> 08:29.546
Giving spirits an open portal?

08:29.780 --> 08:31.386
You're afraid they'll abuse it?

08:32.320 --> 08:33.933
I'm afraid we will.

08:34.226 --> 08:36.746
Yes, it would also have the effect
of putting you out of a job.

08:38.013 --> 08:41.986
All great inventions have been met
with fear and trepidation.

08:42.120 --> 08:43.320
Look at the steam engine.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.653
People were afraid
of traveling at such speeds,

08:45.700 --> 08:48.100
and now, we can't imagine
our lives without it.

08:48.133 --> 08:50.986
The train was a logical
extension of man's capabilities.

08:51.026 --> 08:53.293
Communicating with the dead
is entirely different.

08:53.360 --> 08:55.440
What if opening the door
to the afterlife

08:55.488 --> 08:57.300
was never part of God's plan?

08:57.400 --> 08:59.728
If God wasn't in favour
of scientific advancement,

08:59.746 --> 09:02.050
He never would have granted man
the knowledge to change the world.

09:02.617 --> 09:05.940
Progress always comes
at a price, and it is always worth it.

09:06.737 --> 09:08.180
Not unlike the truth.

09:08.240 --> 09:10.471
With the invention of the light bulb,

09:10.533 --> 09:12.140
I conquered the darkness.

09:14.140 --> 09:15.395
With the Necrophone...

09:17.980 --> 09:19.840
_

09:22.551 --> 09:23.875
I shall conquer death.

09:28.328 --> 09:30.328
Tonight, I believe
we will make history.

09:38.060 --> 09:40.293
_

10:17.262 --> 10:18.213
Eric?

10:20.444 --> 10:23.580
- Eric, stop!
- Rabbi rattling on about God.

10:23.600 --> 10:24.924
Ma wasn't even religious.

10:25.013 --> 10:27.511
We kept kosher.
Went to temple every week.

10:27.555 --> 10:29.404
Yeah, because
our father insisted on it.

10:29.573 --> 10:31.420
This isn't about Ma. It's about you.

10:31.564 --> 10:33.820
And all those other people
she hasn't seen in years.

10:34.088 --> 10:35.360
And whose fault is that?

10:36.755 --> 10:38.140
Ma wanted to go to Europe.

10:38.764 --> 10:40.782
She would've followed you anywhere.

10:41.928 --> 10:44.462
She wouldn't have wanted us
sobbing over her grave,

10:44.515 --> 10:46.097
wallowing in self-pity.

10:46.773 --> 10:48.580
I am trying to honour her memory.

10:48.657 --> 10:49.884
Then throw a party.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.151
Ma believed that life
was meant to be lived!

11:08.380 --> 11:11.555
- Can I help you with that?
- No. I'm all right. Thank you.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.048
Can I get you some coffee?

11:13.180 --> 11:16.460
- No, I'm more of a tea drinker.
- Me too.

11:16.515 --> 11:18.420
These are Mr Edison's favourite.

11:20.008 --> 11:21.351
He's an interesting man.

11:22.900 --> 11:25.688
I know he lacks
certain social graces,

11:25.893 --> 11:26.980
but he's a genius.

11:27.235 --> 11:30.020
Dedicated too. Works 18 hours a day.

11:30.115 --> 11:32.480
The last scientist
I worked for took shortcuts,

11:32.533 --> 11:34.180
exaggerated his findings.

11:34.222 --> 11:35.973
Mr Edison would never do that.

11:36.142 --> 11:38.551
He works on something
until he gets it right.

11:38.995 --> 11:40.400
What about the Necrophone?

11:42.400 --> 11:45.004
Do you believe the bridge
to the afterlife is made of...

11:45.191 --> 11:46.337
bulbs and wires?

11:48.035 --> 11:49.060
I don't know.

11:50.020 --> 11:50.791
But...

11:52.888 --> 11:53.902
what if it is?

11:54.870 --> 11:56.852
What if that box allows us to talk to

11:56.853 --> 11:58.346
anyone who has ever lived?

11:58.790 --> 12:01.600
To Guru Nanak, to Jesus, to Moses,

12:01.671 --> 12:03.580
anyone... ever.

12:07.048 --> 12:09.066
That's not who
you really want to talk to.

12:12.340 --> 12:13.440
Karishma.

12:14.702 --> 12:17.244
My wife passed away four years ago.

12:18.373 --> 12:19.475
Very suddenly.

12:20.595 --> 12:22.400
We had so much ahead of us.

12:23.022 --> 12:24.480
And so much unsaid.

12:26.044 --> 12:27.013
I know.

12:28.220 --> 12:30.977
I lost my husband. Benjamin.

12:32.373 --> 12:33.484
It was also sudden.

12:33.671 --> 12:34.826
I'm so sorry.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.822
Perhaps we are here
for the same reason.

12:42.213 --> 12:43.244
Perhaps we are.

12:44.675 --> 12:46.275
I have recently met someone new.

12:46.711 --> 12:48.666
But I need Karishma's blessing.

12:48.684 --> 12:52.260
I know she will give it to me,
but I need to hear it from her.

12:54.577 --> 12:55.940
Have you met anyone new?

12:55.991 --> 12:57.591
No.

12:58.220 --> 12:59.466
I don't think so.

13:01.840 --> 13:03.351
My husband was murdered.

13:04.266 --> 13:05.420
No.

13:05.470 --> 13:08.880
And I don't know... how or why...

13:10.266 --> 13:11.533
or anything.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.373
So, you are here seeking
answers from Benjamin.

13:17.140 --> 13:19.853
And when you get them,
you will move on.

13:20.706 --> 13:23.400
That's the miracle
of Mr Edison's invention.

13:26.800 --> 13:29.226
But if we know
our loved ones are there,

13:29.520 --> 13:31.053
just on the other side,

13:31.800 --> 13:34.493
watching us, talking to us,

13:35.573 --> 13:37.066
waiting for us...

13:38.080 --> 13:39.980
How will we ever be able to move on?

13:44.420 --> 13:45.773
I found it!

13:50.500 --> 13:52.480
- The right frequency?
- I'm almost certain.

13:52.700 --> 13:54.893
Now we just have to see
if anyone makes contact.

14:07.220 --> 14:08.600
Show yourself.

14:10.053 --> 14:11.386
Please.

14:19.300 --> 14:20.780
Millie.

14:37.733 --> 14:40.180
Mr Turner... He's here.

14:42.850 --> 14:43.920
Thank you.

14:44.350 --> 14:46.930
Mr Turner's presence
was overwhelming.

14:46.990 --> 14:48.450
So much rage.

14:49.020 --> 14:52.770
"Unto the woman,' he said,' I will
greatly multiply thy sorrow."

14:53.250 --> 14:54.530
Book of Genesis.

14:54.810 --> 14:56.830
Maybe Mrs Turner was here as well.

14:56.910 --> 14:58.170
She was killed in this very room.

14:58.530 --> 15:00.510
You're suggesting her spirit

15:00.590 --> 15:02.600
turned the pages of the Bible
to this passage?

15:02.890 --> 15:04.390
Something paranormal did.

15:04.590 --> 15:05.890
We all witnessed it.

15:08.510 --> 15:11.600
Perhaps it was a breeze.
This window is open.

15:11.720 --> 15:14.130
Not enough wind to knock
over and smash those figurines.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.850
Let's see
what the Necrophone recorded.

15:24.860 --> 15:25.910
Did you hear that?

15:26.770 --> 15:28.920
Right before Millie screamed,
I think heard a voice.

15:29.220 --> 15:30.160
Play it again.

15:35.570 --> 15:36.830
There.

15:36.890 --> 15:40.170
- I heard a noise, not a voice.
- I can amplify it.

15:44.450 --> 15:46.920
Resurrect me.

15:49.370 --> 15:52.570
<i>Bring back... Holmes.</i>

15:53.020 --> 15:54.250
Houdini...

15:55.390 --> 15:57.240
- In the flesh.
- What are you doing here?

15:57.280 --> 15:59.030
I wanted to join your sleepover.

15:59.530 --> 16:01.550
Nice call on the breeze, Adelaide.

16:01.670 --> 16:04.930
Once again proving that beautiful
doesn't have to mean dumb.

16:05.010 --> 16:07.380
And the counterargument. Hello, Tom.

16:07.460 --> 16:10.400
Tesla sends his regards.
Says you still owe him 50 grand.

16:10.990 --> 16:13.220
Don't tell me you spent it all
on this piece of junk?

16:13.330 --> 16:16.660
Tesla is a sad man
prone to wild misconceptions.

16:16.690 --> 16:18.440
And the Necrophone utilises the most

16:18.480 --> 16:20.170
sophisticated technology
ever developed.

16:20.300 --> 16:21.660
It's a glorified Ouija board.

16:21.800 --> 16:23.860
Don't pretend
it has any basis in science.

16:23.870 --> 16:26.490
This coming from a man who
performs card tricks for a living.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.240
Not as impressive as the light bulb.

16:31.010 --> 16:32.450
How did you do that?

16:34.060 --> 16:36.850
So, I'm guessing the poltergeist
activity was your handiwork?

16:36.940 --> 16:39.425
I had help from Mother Nature.
It's a blustery night.

16:39.440 --> 16:41.920
I angled the chimney cap
to create a wind tunnel.

16:42.133 --> 16:44.170
I saw Mr Turner in the mirror.

16:44.250 --> 16:47.431
Power of suggestion. When you tell
someone they're in a haunted house,

16:47.466 --> 16:48.580
 they're gonna see spooks.

16:48.622 --> 16:50.266
You went to all
this trouble for a prank?

16:50.346 --> 16:52.450
No. To prove
that people can be fooled.

16:53.410 --> 16:56.720
All that rage you felt? That wasn't
Mr Turner, that was Mr Draught.

16:56.860 --> 16:58.992
Don't worry, I'm sure that
you were right every other time

16:59.016 --> 17:01.200
that you blindly sensed
something in an empty room.

17:01.264 --> 17:03.184
Perhaps it wasn't Mr Turner.

17:03.256 --> 17:06.089
But there is someone
in this room filled with rage.

17:07.839 --> 17:11.020
As well there should be.
They've all been duped.

17:11.369 --> 17:13.520
There are
no such things as poltergeists.

17:13.560 --> 17:15.510
I'm sure you'll find my...

17:15.630 --> 17:18.329
"piece of junk" will prove differently.

17:25.010 --> 17:26.369
We're surprised to see you.

17:26.869 --> 17:29.110
Thought you might want to spend
some time with your family.

17:29.480 --> 17:31.310
There's a reason
I moved to Europe.

17:32.110 --> 17:35.000
You just laid to rest the most
important person in your life.

17:35.070 --> 17:37.160
You need to allow yourself to grieve.

17:37.380 --> 17:39.480
I've been grieving
ever since I found her.

17:40.050 --> 17:42.170
It's time for me
to focus on living again.

17:43.690 --> 17:45.390
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,

17:45.460 --> 17:47.340
but I found this on the train.
I thought you should see it.

17:49.870 --> 17:52.120
_
Walbridge's is going out of business?

17:52.180 --> 17:54.110
That paper is from last week.
They're already closed.

17:54.140 --> 17:56.370
So I took the liberty of tracking
down the real estate agent.

17:56.414 --> 17:58.160
Got a forwarding address
for Walbridge.

17:58.458 --> 18:00.785
Now you'll be able to send a
telegram, set up a meeting.

18:02.458 --> 18:04.829
Wonderful. Thank you.

18:07.112 --> 18:07.716
Hup!

18:08.850 --> 18:10.814
Are you sure
you want separate rooms?

18:10.850 --> 18:12.996
With a killer ghost on the loose,
you'll need protection.

18:13.310 --> 18:15.395
So now
we believe in poltergeists.

18:15.431 --> 18:17.610
For the next
eight hours, absolutely.

18:20.560 --> 18:22.471
Spooks prey on lone victims!

18:22.711 --> 18:25.093
Your persistence is quite astounding.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.128
- Thank you.
- It wasn't a compliment.

18:27.520 --> 18:29.368
Have you ever seen the Grand Canyon?

18:29.431 --> 18:31.386
Persistence can change the world.

18:31.448 --> 18:34.450
And I'm guessing that, similarly,
in a billion years or so,

18:34.533 --> 18:37.250
you may be able to erode
Miss Stratton's defenses.

18:52.530 --> 18:54.770
Penny.

18:57.964 --> 18:58.906
Penny.

19:04.142 --> 19:05.075
Penny.

19:26.417 --> 19:27.448
<i>Penny.</i>

19:30.826 --> 19:31.848
Benjamin?

19:33.450 --> 19:35.724
<i>I'm here, my love.</i>

19:38.711 --> 19:40.650
<i>Please, don't cry.</i>

19:51.822 --> 19:53.795
I know you didn't commit suicide.

19:56.302 --> 19:57.644
Who murdered you?

20:00.530 --> 20:01.946
You have to tell me.

20:03.982 --> 20:05.031
Benjamin?

20:07.280 --> 20:09.235
<i>You are not meant to know.</i>

20:10.930 --> 20:12.770
I need to know.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.466
However painful the truth,

20:17.653 --> 20:20.090
knowing it is far better than not.

20:22.450 --> 20:23.431
Benjamin?

20:28.435 --> 20:30.835
Please... Benjamin?

20:34.170 --> 20:35.128
Come back!

21:06.542 --> 21:08.293
Hey. What took you so long?

21:08.340 --> 21:09.635
You think you're pretty clever.

21:09.680 --> 21:11.600
Scaring me so I'll sleep in your room?

21:11.670 --> 21:13.626
Wow, that is clever.
Wish I'd thought of it.

21:14.808 --> 21:16.328
Look, a man in a night shirt.

21:16.924 --> 21:18.062
What's going on?

21:24.791 --> 21:26.888
This is the room where
the Turners' daughter was murdered.

21:26.924 --> 21:29.137
Mr Carson said she tried
to escape her father's attack

21:29.155 --> 21:30.730
by blocking the door with a chair.

21:30.817 --> 21:33.733
Perhaps her spirits are trying
to protect you from the same fate.

21:34.213 --> 21:36.177
Or perhaps she simply dreamt it.

21:37.040 --> 21:40.035
No, I was having
quite a different dream.

21:40.088 --> 21:42.275
- Woke me up.
- Really? Was I in it?

21:54.088 --> 21:56.880
Clearly someone has rigged this
to mess with you.

21:57.493 --> 21:58.737
No wires.

22:03.850 --> 22:05.431
The floor must be slanted.

22:18.835 --> 22:20.010
Do you hear that?

22:20.355 --> 22:21.564
The Necrophone.

22:32.930 --> 22:35.875
- What are you doing?
- I set it to record a few hours ago.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.911
I think it picked something up.

22:43.370 --> 22:45.475
<i> Falcroft Point.</i>

22:46.204 --> 22:48.960
- Falcroft Point.
- We all heard it.

22:49.330 --> 22:50.400
The cliff.

22:51.137 --> 22:53.004
Where Mr Turner took his own life.

23:05.410 --> 23:06.480
Someone was here.

23:25.431 --> 23:26.577
Mr Avari.

23:37.100 --> 23:40.020
McKELLAR: Did Mr Avari ever show
any signs of depression?

23:40.680 --> 23:42.497
You think
he committed suicide?

23:42.693 --> 23:44.074
I knew the man for five years.

23:44.101 --> 23:45.740
I refuse to believe
he took his own life.

23:45.880 --> 23:47.952
Mr Avari had just met someone.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.440
He was talking about the future.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.504
Then it must have been
a tragic accident.

23:51.893 --> 23:52.860
Or murder.

23:53.605 --> 23:56.980
There was only one set of footprints
at the edge of the cliff. The victim's.

23:57.374 --> 23:59.100
Poltergeists don't leave footprints.

23:59.614 --> 24:02.180
Mr Avari
has bruises on his wrist.

24:02.349 --> 24:03.810
It suggests he was in a struggle.

24:05.185 --> 24:06.305
Or a fall.

24:06.820 --> 24:08.727
Mr Avari fell on his back,

24:09.083 --> 24:10.763
but there are scratches on his chest.

24:11.020 --> 24:12.700
And there are no marks on the shirt.

24:13.396 --> 24:16.538
Unexplained injuries,
classic sign of a poltergeist attack.

24:16.567 --> 24:19.170
There have been cases reported
in Russia, Japan.

24:19.330 --> 24:21.540
His injuries could have occurred
earlier in the night.

24:21.956 --> 24:23.650
The coroner will
make that determination.

24:24.210 --> 24:26.807
- Mr Turner did this.
- The dead guy?

24:27.860 --> 24:30.610
He must have...
lured Avari to the cliff,

24:30.720 --> 24:32.741
they struggled, he pushed him over.

24:33.418 --> 24:36.940
It is eerily similar to
Turner's own death ten years ago.

24:37.098 --> 24:38.712
Eerily or conveniently?

24:39.083 --> 24:42.378
Mr Reid. Now Mr Avari.
Who's next?

24:43.505 --> 24:45.963
It was my Necrophone
that led us to the body.

24:46.305 --> 24:48.820
- The Necrophone?
- You haven't heard of it yet.

24:48.850 --> 24:50.152
It's like the telephone,

24:50.421 --> 24:52.167
except without any paying customers.

24:52.340 --> 24:54.225
Did it tell you what
happened to the deceased?

24:54.305 --> 24:54.899
Well, no.

24:54.900 --> 24:57.352
Then that's all I need to know
about your Necrophone.

25:06.683 --> 25:08.407
Adelaide's talking to the others.

25:10.020 --> 25:13.004
Until we work out who
or what killed Mr Avari,

25:13.208 --> 25:14.657
I think we should avoid being alone.

25:15.306 --> 25:16.320
Good idea.

25:16.382 --> 25:19.137
If Edison can contact
Mr Avari's spirit,

25:19.457 --> 25:22.968
perhaps he can offer testimony
that a poltergeist murdered him.

25:23.653 --> 25:25.540
The Necrophone doesn't work.

25:26.106 --> 25:29.075
Yeah, I heard a voice. That doesn't
mean it came from the other side.

25:29.128 --> 25:31.140
You're suggesting someone
tampered with the device?

25:31.182 --> 25:33.875
Same person
that killed Avari. A human being.

25:33.928 --> 25:36.871
If someone pushed him, there
would be two sets of shoe prints.

25:38.560 --> 25:40.880
The mud on Avari's shoes

25:40.906 --> 25:42.951
had a reddish hue. This soil doesn't.

25:43.813 --> 25:44.995
Where did it come from?

25:54.340 --> 25:55.413
Hey!

25:57.460 --> 26:00.380
- What is it?
- The woman in the coroner's wagon.

26:00.417 --> 26:02.702
- I think she may be following me.
- You've seen her before?

26:02.906 --> 26:04.355
Yeah. At my mother's funeral.

26:05.804 --> 26:08.720
And now she's here in Canada,
working with the coroner?

26:09.262 --> 26:10.684
I swear it was her.

26:13.475 --> 26:16.017
It may take a while
to get over your mother's passing.

26:18.524 --> 26:20.302
Thanks for the homily. I'm fine.

26:20.382 --> 26:23.137
You're running. You couldn't wait
to get out of New York.

26:23.180 --> 26:25.395
- Jumped into this case.
- You needed me.

26:25.706 --> 26:27.066
Do you think, if you don't grieve,

26:27.617 --> 26:29.093
your mother's death won't be real?

26:29.475 --> 26:30.660
Hey. I know she's dead.

26:30.782 --> 26:33.546
Knowing it and accepting it
are two separate things.

26:35.800 --> 26:37.866
You came here for the Necrophone,

26:38.160 --> 26:40.835
didn't you? You want to try
and contact your mother.

26:40.871 --> 26:42.115
- That's ridiculous.
- I saw your face

26:42.168 --> 26:43.777
when you first saw the machine,
you were fascinated.

26:43.822 --> 26:45.540
You have me confused with you.

26:45.724 --> 26:47.822
- I admit I have a vested interest.
- No, you don't.

26:47.884 --> 26:50.915
- Touie's not dead.
- I have to prepare for the inevitable.

26:51.004 --> 26:54.382
The Necrophone will keep Touie
in our family forever.

26:54.444 --> 26:57.540
My children will never know the pain
of losing their mother.

26:57.582 --> 26:59.380
And as long as she's alive,
there's hope.

26:59.475 --> 27:01.066
Stop planning for her death.

27:01.140 --> 27:02.977
You claim you love your wife so much?

27:03.502 --> 27:04.711
Then fight for her.

27:09.742 --> 27:12.524
So you think I've tampered
with my own invention? Is that it?

27:12.755 --> 27:14.613
No one knows the machine
better than you.

27:14.700 --> 27:16.621
Whatever else you may
think of me, Mr Houdini,

27:16.646 --> 27:18.420
I am first and foremost a scientist.

27:18.443 --> 27:21.420
The last thing I would ever do...
is falsify data.

27:21.575 --> 27:23.963
And what's the second last thing
you'd do? Murder?

27:25.790 --> 27:27.753
Mr Avari was a good man
and a hard worker.

27:27.778 --> 27:28.900
Why on earth would I kill him?

27:28.984 --> 27:30.793
Because he knew
the Necrophone was a fraud.

27:31.156 --> 27:32.510
And you couldn't let that get out.

27:32.780 --> 27:34.080
Let's face it,

27:34.240 --> 27:37.005
if you could market a device
to communicate to the dead,

27:37.085 --> 27:38.380
it would be bigger than the lightbulb.

27:38.422 --> 27:40.754
- No better motive than that.
- You think I did this for money?

27:41.500 --> 27:43.221
I'm trying
to give people a chance

27:43.243 --> 27:44.930
to reconnect with those
who have passed.

27:45.320 --> 27:47.498
To find some closure.
To say, "I love you."

27:47.723 --> 27:48.700
To a machine.

27:51.580 --> 27:54.900
I was 24... when my mother died.

27:56.210 --> 27:59.100
She believed in me
when no one else would.

27:59.389 --> 28:01.803
But she died
before she saw my success.

28:03.860 --> 28:05.003
I want her to know...

28:07.190 --> 28:09.272
I want her to know
that her faith in me...

28:09.992 --> 28:11.260
was not misplaced.

28:21.340 --> 28:22.700
<i>Ehrie.</i>

28:27.563 --> 28:28.778
Is this your idea of a joke?

28:30.300 --> 28:31.740
How did you know about my mother?

28:31.920 --> 28:34.340
You heard her?
What did she say?

28:36.100 --> 28:37.980
What did she say?

29:23.920 --> 29:24.880
You're drinking.

29:24.950 --> 29:26.660
Care to join me?

29:27.370 --> 29:28.620
No, thank you.

29:35.850 --> 29:37.110
Are you all right?

29:37.610 --> 29:39.850
Edison told me you heard
your mother's voice.

29:40.410 --> 29:43.220
I heard... the power of suggestion

29:43.300 --> 29:44.670
screaming in my head.

29:46.610 --> 29:47.740
That won't help.

29:48.730 --> 29:50.640
What? Go on a bash
after your husband died?

29:51.700 --> 29:53.030
I did a lot of things.

29:53.350 --> 29:54.640
Like changing your name?

29:55.600 --> 29:56.670
Becoming a cop?

29:57.910 --> 29:59.530
I did that to find answers.

29:59.850 --> 30:01.600
You hear back from Walbridge yet?

30:04.830 --> 30:06.590
You never did send him
a telegram, did you?

30:09.220 --> 30:12.330
You've stopped looking for answers...
because you're afraid.

30:12.460 --> 30:15.790
What if Benjamin was an assassin
involved with the anarchists?

30:17.770 --> 30:19.490
But, whatever the truth,
you'll deal with it.

30:21.390 --> 30:23.010
You're one
of the strongest people I know.

30:30.040 --> 30:31.150
So are you.

30:32.810 --> 30:34.790
But it's all right
not to be sometimes.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.560
She wanted to go to Coney Island.

30:46.660 --> 30:48.380
Eat salt water taffy.

31:04.390 --> 31:06.110
- Harry.
- I'm sorry. I didn't...

31:07.190 --> 31:09.890
Oh... good. You're both here.

31:09.950 --> 31:11.820
I have something to show you.

31:16.140 --> 31:19.240
I was looking for the source
of the red mud on Mr Avari's shoes.

31:19.290 --> 31:20.960
I recalled, from our tour
of the house,

31:21.020 --> 31:23.560
that the cellar had a dirt floor.

31:23.680 --> 31:24.970
Smells damp.

31:25.130 --> 31:26.910
Pipe's rusted through.
It's leaking.

31:30.630 --> 31:33.950
Red-coloured mud. You think Avari
was down here before he was killed?

31:34.000 --> 31:35.990
Maybe he heard something,
came to investigate.

31:42.160 --> 31:44.930
Listen. About what happened...
I'm sorry.

31:45.740 --> 31:48.000
You're hurting. I understand.

31:49.260 --> 31:50.970
Thank you. It won't happen again.

31:53.200 --> 31:54.220
Good.

31:54.360 --> 31:55.600
Over here.

32:00.670 --> 32:02.920
- More rust?
- No pipes.

32:02.990 --> 32:05.860
It's a drop of blood.
Half a drop, anyway.

32:11.400 --> 32:12.970
There's something behind here.

32:21.490 --> 32:23.070
More than just one drop.

32:23.520 --> 32:25.070
Avari was murdered here.

32:26.190 --> 32:27.640
In all likelihood,

32:28.150 --> 32:29.570
he was never on the cliff.

32:29.840 --> 32:32.050
The killer planted
his footprints there.

32:32.150 --> 32:34.560
Then staged the body
to blame it on a spirit.

32:34.670 --> 32:35.810
You were right.

32:37.690 --> 32:39.370
Avari was killed by a human being.

32:39.750 --> 32:41.930
Who rigged the Necrophone
to lead us right to the body.

32:46.120 --> 32:48.170
Oh... Hello.

32:51.050 --> 32:52.410
What is that?

32:53.830 --> 32:55.330
An electromagnet.

32:55.570 --> 32:56.900
Very clever.

32:57.110 --> 32:59.720
That's how the chair in Addie's
bedroom moved on its own.

32:59.860 --> 33:02.940
Legs had metal fittings.
Someone held this under the floor.

33:03.270 --> 33:04.750
Avari probably discovered this.

33:04.810 --> 33:06.020
That's why he was killed.

33:06.180 --> 33:07.400
Look at this.

33:12.020 --> 33:13.290
Maxwell.

33:16.100 --> 33:17.253
The Reids' baby.

33:17.566 --> 33:20.773
He died of influenza,
just a month old.

33:22.790 --> 33:25.610
Why would the Reids bury
their son in a secret room

33:25.650 --> 33:26.700
in the basement?

33:39.530 --> 33:41.690
See the contusions
on the back of the skull?

33:43.590 --> 33:45.120
This baby was murdered.

33:45.650 --> 33:47.840
Mrs Reid said
he died of influenza.

33:47.900 --> 33:51.010
She also said a poltergeist killed her
husband. Maybe she killed both of them.

33:51.080 --> 33:53.640
We know she wasn't responsible
for Mr Avari's death.

33:53.690 --> 33:54.880
Someone's helping her.

33:55.660 --> 33:58.860
Someone who's willing to kill
to propagate her haunted-house theory.

33:59.230 --> 34:00.540
That's a good friend.

34:00.610 --> 34:02.860
I'll bet she's having
an affair with this guy.

34:03.250 --> 34:04.890
And this is his baby.

34:05.350 --> 34:07.820
Why else would he put
fresh flowers on this grave?

34:13.040 --> 34:14.690
Emmett found a love letter.

34:15.360 --> 34:17.130
I had never seen him so angry.

34:17.159 --> 34:21.130
He hit me over and over again.

34:21.790 --> 34:23.770
And then he turned
his rage on the baby.

34:25.150 --> 34:26.940
Why didn't you go to the police?

34:28.719 --> 34:30.449
He said he'd kill me, too.

34:30.900 --> 34:33.520
You killed your husband
because of what he did to your son?

34:33.560 --> 34:37.400
No! No, I told you,
a poltergeist killed Emmett.

34:37.489 --> 34:38.570
Mrs Reid,

34:38.989 --> 34:40.699
we know the haunting was faked.

34:41.040 --> 34:42.080
Faked?

34:42.920 --> 34:44.570
What are you talking about?

34:44.630 --> 34:46.150
We found evidence,

34:46.650 --> 34:48.929
in the same room
your son was buried.

34:49.460 --> 34:52.060
No. No, it's not possible.

34:58.330 --> 35:01.130
Mrs Reid, your lover is
orchestrating the haunting.

35:02.490 --> 35:04.460
Was he the one
who killed your husband?

35:08.570 --> 35:10.490
You can't protect him any more.
Give him up.

35:15.380 --> 35:18.520
Then maybe the dearly
departed Mr Reid will.

35:27.350 --> 35:30.000
<i>You killed me.</i>

35:30.090 --> 35:32.889
- Is that Mr Avari?
- I'm not sure.

35:32.890 --> 35:35.210
- It does sound male.
<i>- You killed me.</i>

35:35.250 --> 35:37.290
- There.
- I'll try to amplify it.

35:40.640 --> 35:43.110
<i>You... killed me.</i>

35:43.170 --> 35:46.240
- That's not Avari.
- Then it must be Mr Reid.

35:46.300 --> 35:49.990
<i>You killed me, Carson.</i>

35:53.630 --> 35:56.160
- <i>You killed me, Carson.</i>
- You're making it say that.

35:56.230 --> 35:58.470
- You're trying to set me up.
- I did no such thing.

35:58.520 --> 36:00.570
<i>Clara's mine.</i>

36:01.220 --> 36:02.950
<i>Clara's mine.</i>

36:03.630 --> 36:06.300
- It's not possible
- <i>Clara's mine.</i>

36:06.330 --> 36:07.830
Were you involved with Mrs Reid?

36:09.660 --> 36:11.070
Is that why you killed him?

36:11.888 --> 36:12.580
Look out!

36:13.850 --> 36:16.290
<i>Confess. Confess. Confess.</i>

36:16.352 --> 36:18.050
It's the only way
to make it stop!

36:18.640 --> 36:20.600
<i>Confess. Confess!</i>

36:20.730 --> 36:23.312
Wait. All right! All right,
all right, all right! I...

36:23.432 --> 36:24.570
I killed Reid!

36:25.672 --> 36:27.685
You murdered him
so you could be with his wife.

36:27.700 --> 36:29.872
I didn't plan it! He...

36:30.064 --> 36:31.630
found out I was in love with Clara.

36:31.660 --> 36:33.992
- He came at me with a knife.
- Then he tried to pin it on a ghost.

36:34.050 --> 36:36.704
There were already rumours that this
place was haunted. Clara believed it.

36:36.728 --> 36:40.330
She called me to investigate some
strange things that were happening.

36:41.430 --> 36:44.608
I thought that if I could convince
people that this place was haunted,

36:44.624 --> 36:47.530
then she would be set free
and we would be together.

36:51.390 --> 36:53.664
Once I contact the police,
you'll formally be charged

36:53.688 --> 36:56.032
with the murders of Emmett Reid
and Rustom Avari.

36:57.990 --> 36:59.720
Knife was a bit much,
don't you think?

36:59.776 --> 37:01.184
Yeah? Maybe you're right.

37:01.232 --> 37:03.432
Wait, it worked, so scratch that.

37:05.984 --> 37:07.720
<i>Ehrie.</i>

37:22.290 --> 37:23.969
<i>Ehrie.</i>

37:23.970 --> 37:26.672
They're all coming through!
All the lost souls!

37:27.330 --> 37:29.330
Argh!

37:29.360 --> 37:29.952
Millie!

37:34.255 --> 37:35.575
I've opened the gates of hell.

37:38.870 --> 37:40.370
No!

38:01.730 --> 38:03.774
What happened downstairs,
that was...

38:04.429 --> 38:05.738
something.

38:10.298 --> 38:12.109
I'm sorry you didn't get
to contact your mother.

38:12.546 --> 38:15.573
Yeah, well, it's a nice fantasy,

38:15.653 --> 38:17.706
being able to talk to the dead.

38:18.053 --> 38:20.466
The Necrophone worked.
All those voices.

38:20.520 --> 38:23.360
- Manufactured by Edison.
- Edison destroyed his own machine?

38:23.420 --> 38:26.133
He knew it didn't work, so
he came up with an elaborate show to

38:26.293 --> 38:27.680
cover up his failure.

38:27.800 --> 38:29.613
You don't mean that.

38:33.760 --> 38:35.560
Don't quit on your wife.

38:39.050 --> 38:41.173
There's nothing
more medicine can do for her.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.013
Hey, you can't say that.

38:43.160 --> 38:46.090
Not until you've tried the doctors in
New York, who are the best in the world.

38:46.813 --> 38:48.040
You gotta go.

38:49.210 --> 38:50.293
I can't.

38:51.760 --> 38:54.600
Waking up every morning,
desperately hoping.

38:55.106 --> 38:57.013
Going to bed every evening, broken.

38:58.520 --> 39:00.173
I have to face reality.

39:04.013 --> 39:05.540
You can't give up on hope.

39:06.853 --> 39:09.080
You're not capable of it.
That's reality.

39:09.666 --> 39:11.400
You know, she's alive.

39:11.800 --> 39:13.373
And maybe that's a nightmare.

39:14.066 --> 39:15.733
But that's your reality too.

39:17.173 --> 39:18.693
And your reality?

39:31.940 --> 39:34.880
_

40:21.106 --> 40:22.200
Benjamin?

40:22.600 --> 40:24.853
Yes, my love, it's me.

40:27.706 --> 40:28.880
You're alive.

40:30.786 --> 40:33.240
Look, I know this is an awful shock.

40:33.620 --> 40:35.906
- I saw you hanging.
- That was a rope trick.

40:36.240 --> 40:38.560
- The coroner's report said...
- I have a friend there.

40:44.448 --> 40:46.024
I deserve far worse than that.

40:46.056 --> 40:48.368
- Why would you do this?
- It's very complicated.

40:48.392 --> 40:49.136
Why?

40:52.376 --> 40:55.952
My cousin in the Home Office,
he came to me, desperate.

40:56.480 --> 40:58.480
They were investigating
an anarchist group and...

40:59.080 --> 41:00.952
as a foreign securities broker...

41:01.824 --> 41:03.000
I could travel anywhere.

41:03.392 --> 41:05.016
You were an undercover agent?

41:05.520 --> 41:06.864
Until they found me out.

41:07.640 --> 41:08.928
That's when I had to disappear.

41:09.912 --> 41:12.320
- Without telling me?
- You needed deniability.

41:13.272 --> 41:15.568
- You could have taken me with you.
- Into hiding?

41:16.040 --> 41:19.008
- What kind of life would it be?
- What kind of life did you leave me with?

41:19.144 --> 41:20.808
These are dangerous people.

41:21.208 --> 41:22.736
They sent you that threatening note.

41:22.816 --> 41:24.176
They ransacked your flat.

41:26.112 --> 41:27.272
I know all about that.

41:31.920 --> 41:33.504
They took all of your things.

41:33.728 --> 41:34.576
Everything?

41:36.120 --> 41:38.680
Except your copy of Tom Sawyer.

41:39.310 --> 41:40.608
I lent it to Houdini.

41:42.024 --> 41:43.440
You've become good friends.

41:45.208 --> 41:46.832
As if you have the right to comment.

41:49.048 --> 41:51.888
Do you know how hard I tried
not to fall in love with you?

41:57.390 --> 42:00.632
So... what now?

42:01.350 --> 42:02.664
Once I'm done, I'll come home.

42:03.848 --> 42:05.808
But you have to stop pursuing this.

42:07.136 --> 42:08.200
You have to trust me.

42:09.024 --> 42:10.376
They killed Nigel Pennington.

42:10.704 --> 42:12.512
And they won't hesitate
to kill you too.

42:14.568 --> 42:15.360
Please, Penny...

42:16.560 --> 42:17.448
I love you.

42:27.240 --> 42:29.376
I have to go. It's not safe for us.

43:17.848 --> 43:18.616
Amen.
