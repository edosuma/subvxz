18:48.628 --> 18:50.630
Eric, you mind?

18:55.635 --> 18:57.928
Let me tell you something
before you even start in.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.140
When I first took
this job,

19:01.140 --> 19:03.142
I took it with an idea
of a five‐year commitment.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.977
But when I sat down
with you and the boosters,

19:05.019 --> 19:06.479
I never heard
any similar commitment come

19:06.520 --> 19:07.980
from the other side.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.148
Matter of fact,
all I heard was,

19:09.190 --> 19:10.983
after we lost the second game
of the year,

19:10.983 --> 19:12.652
is that my ass was about
to be fired.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.488
I just wanna make that
real clear right now.

19:15.488 --> 19:18.282
So yes, I did put my career
ahead of Panther football.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.951
Eric, I just came by

19:20.993 --> 19:22.995
to tell you how much
I'm gonna miss you.

19:23.037 --> 19:26.165
You're a fine
football coach.

19:27.708 --> 19:29.585
That's what I came
to tell you.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.340
(Buddy)
And now, everybody...

19:34.382 --> 19:36.175
it's my pleasure
to introduce the man

19:36.175 --> 19:38.469
who has taken this team
to State this year‐‐

19:38.511 --> 19:40.304
his first year

19:40.346 --> 19:43.182
as the head coach
of the Dillon Panthers:

19:43.224 --> 19:44.517
my friend...

19:44.517 --> 19:46.519
Eric Taylor!

19:46.560 --> 19:50.106
[applause]

20:01.367 --> 20:03.035
I'm gonna
cut through the crap.

20:03.077 --> 20:06.247
I believe I know what you all
are thinking right now.

20:06.288 --> 20:07.707
Y'all are thinking,

20:07.748 --> 20:09.583
"Coach is a bastard
for taking this job."

20:09.583 --> 20:12.545
I would say to that,

20:12.586 --> 20:14.547
that y'all have dreams.

20:14.547 --> 20:15.548
A lot of you have dreams

20:15.589 --> 20:17.550
to play college ball,

20:17.550 --> 20:19.218
pro ball.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.387
There is nothing
more important to me

20:21.387 --> 20:24.014
than to help you
achieve those dreams.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.182
I promise you that.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.144
I have dreams too.

20:29.270 --> 20:32.064
This has long been
a dream of mine

20:32.064 --> 20:33.566
to coach
a Division One school,

20:33.607 --> 20:35.526
like TMU.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.573
Whatever it is
you're feeling,

20:40.573 --> 20:42.575
I don't blame you.

20:42.575 --> 20:46.078
It is all pretty raw.

20:46.120 --> 20:49.123
You may not
accept it now.

20:49.123 --> 20:51.292
But I pray
one day you will.

20:53.294 --> 20:54.587
I don't like the press.

20:54.628 --> 20:56.672
I never have.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.594
Shoulda been
done different.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.387
I apologize it wasn't.

21:12.104 --> 21:15.107
[applause]

21:21.447 --> 21:22.448
Let's go get State!

21:22.448 --> 21:23.699
Come on,
let's go get State!

21:25.117 --> 21:26.786
Panthers!
Panthers!

21:26.786 --> 21:28.287
Panthers!
Panthers!

21:28.287 --> 21:30.831
[cheering and clapping]

21:43.469 --> 21:44.637
(male reporter)
The timing
of the shocking news

21:44.637 --> 21:46.263
of Coach Taylor's exit
from Dillon football

21:46.305 --> 21:47.431
couldn't be worse.

21:47.473 --> 21:49.308
(Riggins)
Pretty pathetic,
if you ask me, gentlemen.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.643
(Bradley)
That's right, man.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.812
How many "all for one" speeches
has he given us?

21:52.812 --> 21:54.313
I mean, one year
and he's out?

21:54.313 --> 21:55.606
Look, everyone
settle down.

21:55.648 --> 21:56.774
Stop being babies, okay?

21:56.816 --> 21:57.525
He got an offer to TMU.

21:57.566 --> 21:58.984
If any of you
got an offer to TMU,

21:59.026 --> 22:00.152
you'd be gone
in a heartbeat.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.237
(Smash)
Street's right.

22:01.278 --> 22:02.446
Look, forget about Coach.

22:02.488 --> 22:04.281
He earned it.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.199
It's up to us now.

22:05.241 --> 22:07.701
(Riggins)
Who do we have here gentlemen?

22:11.372 --> 22:13.541
Long time, boys.

22:13.582 --> 22:14.625
Look who it is.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.126
Yo, Smash,
can we talk a sec?

22:25.177 --> 22:26.345
Hey look, trash talk
before the game

22:26.345 --> 22:27.429
is a sign of weakness.

22:27.471 --> 22:29.014
Look, I ain't here
to trash talk.

22:29.056 --> 22:30.808
I been watching
your game tapes, Smash.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.310
Now you the best damn back
in the state of Texas,

22:33.352 --> 22:34.144
probably the country.

22:35.688 --> 22:38.649
Next year, come play with me
at West Cam.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.317
A'ight, me and you
together,

22:40.359 --> 22:41.443
that would be
like nothing

22:41.485 --> 22:43.487
this state has ever seen.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.322
Every college in the country
will want you.

22:45.364 --> 22:48.701
At West Cambria, look,
they'll set you up real good.

22:48.742 --> 22:50.327
I got a nice place.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.204
Got a swimming pool.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.081
I got a dishwasher.

22:54.123 --> 22:56.375
It's nice.

22:56.417 --> 22:57.501
They don't treat us

22:57.543 --> 22:59.712
like second class
citizens, a'ight?

22:59.753 --> 23:02.089
They take care of us.

23:03.549 --> 23:05.092
I'm a Panther.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.721
It's just
a uniform, Smash.

23:08.762 --> 23:09.722
Look at your coach,

23:09.763 --> 23:11.432
I don't see him
sticking around.

23:19.607 --> 23:21.066
(Saracen)
I mean, he's basically leaving

23:21.108 --> 23:22.860
just to wear
some stupid...

23:22.902 --> 23:24.862
red and gold shirt

23:24.904 --> 23:26.322
and be
a quarterback coach.

23:26.363 --> 23:27.740
And we're just, like,

23:27.740 --> 23:29.825
another stop along the way
for him.

23:29.867 --> 23:32.244
I understand
how you feel,

23:32.244 --> 23:35.122
but all my dad ever does
is think about the team.

23:35.164 --> 23:38.292
He's always
watching game tapes

23:38.334 --> 23:39.668
and having
endless conversations

23:39.710 --> 23:42.755
with my mom about you
and Smash and Riggins.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.757
He's always
analyzing

23:44.757 --> 23:47.176
and strategizing
and planning.

23:47.217 --> 23:48.427
It's his
whole life, Matt.

23:48.469 --> 23:50.304
Yeah, then why
is he leaving?

23:52.431 --> 23:53.641
I don't know.

23:59.480 --> 24:01.148
Sir?

24:03.609 --> 24:05.736
What are you doing up?
It's past bed check.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.906
I was with your daughter.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.453
I understand
if you're pissed at me.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.580
'Cause I took the job.

24:18.832 --> 24:21.168
That I won't be here
next season.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.755
That I'm taking
Julie away.

24:25.798 --> 24:28.133
All I can say
is I'm sorry.

24:28.175 --> 24:29.551
But let me
tell you this.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.303
And don't forget
what I say.

24:31.303 --> 24:34.640
If you're ever...

24:34.640 --> 24:36.725
lucky to have a family

24:36.767 --> 24:39.478
like I do,

24:39.520 --> 24:41.855
I promise you,
you will understand.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.361
I'll see you
at the game.

24:53.325 --> 24:54.326
[door opens]

24:58.038 --> 24:59.206
Hey, hon.

24:59.248 --> 25:00.249
Hey.

25:00.290 --> 25:01.583
Honey, I'm sorry
I couldn't make it

25:01.625 --> 25:03.836
to that booster dinner,
I just couldn't do it tonight.

25:03.836 --> 25:04.962
The Buddy Garrity
of it all.

25:05.004 --> 25:07.256
I just couldn't‐‐
It's okay.

25:07.297 --> 25:09.258
You all right?

25:09.299 --> 25:10.509
Yeah.
Hey.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.844
Chocolate?

25:11.844 --> 25:13.220
No, thank you.

25:24.565 --> 25:25.858
I'm just gonna‐‐

25:25.858 --> 25:28.318
talk to your dad
for a sec.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.368
You all right, babe?

25:36.368 --> 25:36.994
Mm‐hmm.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.829
I'm all right.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.330
I saw that news came out.

25:43.584 --> 25:45.044
Hell, I tried talking
to those kids.

25:45.044 --> 25:48.297
The kids
don't understand.

25:48.338 --> 25:49.548
You're a good man, babe.

25:49.590 --> 25:51.258
Honey?

25:53.385 --> 25:55.387
I gotta tell you something

25:55.429 --> 25:57.556
that I've been meaning
to tell you all day

25:57.556 --> 25:59.641
and I just haven't‐‐
haven't been able to

25:59.683 --> 26:01.310
and it's the worst‐‐
worst timing

26:01.351 --> 26:03.395
and I'm sorry
about that.

26:03.437 --> 26:05.481
And we haven't talked
about this in a long time

26:05.522 --> 26:07.691
and just don't know
how you're gonna take it.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.030
I'm pregnant.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.949
What'd you say?

26:17.284 --> 26:19.495
I said
I'm pregnant.

26:19.536 --> 26:22.372
You're pregnant?

26:22.414 --> 26:23.415
Yeah.

26:25.751 --> 26:27.044
You're pregnant, like,

26:27.086 --> 26:28.587
you're gonna have
a baby, pregnant?

26:37.387 --> 26:38.931
Look me in the eye
and tell me that.

26:38.972 --> 26:41.016
I'm looking.

26:41.058 --> 26:43.435
We're gonna
have a baby, honey.

26:43.435 --> 26:44.895
You look a little peaked.

26:47.731 --> 26:49.483
[laughs]

26:51.401 --> 26:52.402
Come here.

26:55.405 --> 26:56.532
Come here.

26:58.575 --> 26:59.660
[laughs]
Oh.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.412
Oh.

27:05.499 --> 27:07.793
[laughs]
I love you.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.461
I love you.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.049
Babe.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.636
[cheering]

27:17.678 --> 27:19.888
(announcer)
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

27:19.930 --> 27:22.975
to the Texas State
Football Championship,

27:22.975 --> 27:26.603
the Dillon Panthers.

27:28.021 --> 27:30.148
Welcome,
ladies and gentlemen.

27:30.148 --> 27:31.483
The wait is over.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.902
We are finally here!

27:33.944 --> 27:36.822
Our Panthers have clawed
and scratched all season

27:36.822 --> 27:39.992
and today's game
will not be any different

27:39.992 --> 27:42.494
as rumors of Coach Taylor's
departure

27:42.536 --> 27:43.495
have not been exaggerated.

27:43.537 --> 27:44.788
Now let's see

27:44.830 --> 27:46.874
how his leaving will affect

27:46.874 --> 27:48.876
these young players
and his ability to lead

27:48.876 --> 27:51.670
here in the biggest
football game of their lives.

27:51.670 --> 27:55.424
I think the entire town
of Dillon is here.

27:55.465 --> 27:56.508
The great state of Texas
is watching.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.677
The two best teams
are in the house.

27:58.677 --> 28:01.847
But like the man said,
"there can only be one."

28:01.847 --> 28:03.849
Good seats.

28:03.891 --> 28:07.102
Yeah well,
I've got connections.

28:07.144 --> 28:08.478
Thank you.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.521
All right, listen up.

28:09.563 --> 28:12.482
Let's own this game from
the opening gun, gentlemen.

28:12.524 --> 28:13.483
Understood?

28:13.525 --> 28:15.652
Let's go!

28:15.694 --> 28:19.197
[hard rock music]

28:19.197 --> 28:22.492
(announcer)
Saracen opens right.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.037
He throws. Oh!

28:25.037 --> 28:27.623
And the ball comes up short.

28:28.916 --> 28:30.000
Down he goes.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.501
Saracen gets sacked

28:31.543 --> 28:33.587
for an 11‐yard loss.
Look for the slant!

28:35.547 --> 28:37.049
Damn it, Matt!

28:37.049 --> 28:38.634
(announcer)
Matt Saracen

28:38.675 --> 28:40.552
and this Panther offense

28:40.552 --> 28:42.554
are off to
a horrendous start.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.514
Taylor has to be concerned.

28:44.556 --> 28:46.183
His team has come out flat

28:46.224 --> 28:48.560
against this ferocious
Mustang attack.

28:48.560 --> 28:49.937
Voodoo opens right.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.189
No, no, no!

28:52.230 --> 28:54.066
He breaks the tackle!
He's gonna go in.

28:54.107 --> 28:55.734
And touchdown.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.195
Just like that
it is seven, zip.

28:58.236 --> 28:59.863
Voodoo's back to pass.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.575
He's got a man open!

29:03.575 --> 29:05.577
Touchdown, West Cam.

29:05.577 --> 29:06.995
Up by 14.

29:07.037 --> 29:08.956
We're being punished,
I know it.

29:08.956 --> 29:09.957
It's the curse of Voodoo.

29:09.998 --> 29:12.209
(announcer)
And Ray "Voodoo" Tatom

29:12.250 --> 29:15.212
is really starting
to light it up now, folks.

29:15.253 --> 29:17.089
Don't look at him,
don't even think about him.

29:17.089 --> 29:18.256
You understand me?

29:18.256 --> 29:20.092
You stay inside yourself and
think about your next series.

29:20.092 --> 29:21.385
(announcer)
This is it.

29:21.426 --> 29:23.595
Coach Taylor's offense
is gonna have one more shot

29:23.595 --> 29:25.764
to get some points on
the board before the half.

29:25.806 --> 29:28.600
Saracen drops back to pass.

29:31.561 --> 29:32.562
Oh no!

29:32.604 --> 29:33.939
No!

29:33.939 --> 29:35.774
(announcer)
Picked up inside the 25.

29:35.816 --> 29:38.610
He is gonna go.

29:38.652 --> 29:39.861
Touchdown Mustangs.

29:39.903 --> 29:41.279
Holy smokes,

29:41.279 --> 29:43.448
the Mustangs
have jumped out

29:43.490 --> 29:44.950

for these players.

(man on radio)
He took a team
that was battered,

41:38.997 --> 41:40.623
a town
that was ailing,

41:40.665 --> 41:42.625
and he did more than
put a Band‐Aid on things.

41:42.667 --> 41:43.751
I'll tell ya that.

41:43.793 --> 41:46.629
He healed this team
and he healed this town.

41:46.671 --> 41:48.339
Now, how a man
like that

41:48.339 --> 41:49.966
can abandon his team
after one season

41:50.008 --> 41:50.967
is another question.

41:51.009 --> 41:53.011
Is he a great coach
turned into

41:53.011 --> 41:55.138
an even greater
opportunist maybe?

41:55.179 --> 41:57.432
Hell, I don't know.
Let's take some calls.

41:57.473 --> 41:59.350
Tug from Barstow,
what do you got?

41:59.350 --> 42:01.436
(Tug)
I shook that man's
hand once, Sammy.

42:01.477 --> 42:03.021
I thought
he had a heart.

42:03.021 --> 42:05.273
I guess I was wrong.

42:11.029 --> 42:13.031
(Street)
Take a knee.

42:13.031 --> 42:15.033
All right, y'all.
Today we're champions.

42:15.033 --> 42:16.034
Feels good, right?

42:16.034 --> 42:16.701
(Panthers)
Yeah!

42:16.701 --> 42:18.453
Enjoy it while it lasts

42:18.494 --> 42:20.371
'cause tomorrow
we're targets.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.165
Next season,
every other team in Texas

42:22.206 --> 42:24.542
is gonna be gunning for us
'cause we're number one.

42:24.584 --> 42:25.585
And I don't know
about y'all,

42:25.626 --> 42:27.378
but, uh, anything less than
another state championship

42:27.378 --> 42:29.547
is completely unacceptable.

42:29.547 --> 42:30.548
So here's what
we're gonna do.

42:30.590 --> 42:33.176
Everyone think about
the off‐season.

42:33.217 --> 42:34.385
The off‐season's
about development.

42:34.385 --> 42:36.054
Development of strength.
Development of speed.

42:36.054 --> 42:38.181
Development of character.

42:38.222 --> 42:40.058
Football is a 12‐month,
52‐week,

42:40.058 --> 42:42.477
365‐day commitment,
gentlemen.

42:43.561 --> 42:44.562
Have a great day today.

42:44.562 --> 42:46.731
Enjoy it while it lasts.
Tomorrow we go to work.

42:46.731 --> 42:48.024
Got it?

42:48.066 --> 42:49.275
(Panthers)
Yes, sir.
