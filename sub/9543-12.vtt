00:36.444 --> 00:38.812
What are you doing?
I like it open.

00:38.847 --> 00:40.687
Somebody might see me.

00:41.319 --> 00:44.742
Well, I gotta get going.
Thank you so much for letting me stay.

00:44.777 --> 00:47.344
You are the best ex-wife
a guy ever had.

00:47.379 --> 00:51.455
Speaking of which, I believe
I have some money coming.

00:51.566 --> 00:52.910
Yeah, I know, Susan.

00:52.945 --> 00:54.810
I don't wanna get
the lawyers involved again.

00:54.845 --> 00:56.931
You're gonna see
every nickel. I promise.

00:56.966 --> 00:58.902
It's a lotta nickels, Brad.

00:58.937 --> 01:01.249
Ten million dollars worth.

01:01.935 --> 01:04.536
My business manager will
call you this afternoon, okay?

01:04.571 --> 01:05.981
Thank you again.

01:07.356 --> 01:09.043
Stomach is in.

01:13.097 --> 01:15.123
Susan. Will you
come here a sec?

01:15.158 --> 01:17.705
I'm busy.
I already started.

01:18.714 --> 01:20.620
Please. Just come
here for a second.

01:22.815 --> 01:24.706
Man, how did they find you?

01:24.741 --> 01:27.180
If they set foot on your property,
just call the police, okay?

01:27.215 --> 01:28.928
- Okay.
- Thank you.

01:31.181 --> 01:33.012
Listen, guys...

01:33.047 --> 01:34.296
Hey, Gina, how are you?

01:34.331 --> 01:37.069
Listen, just leave
my ex-wife outta this, okay?

01:37.104 --> 01:38.716
She had nothing to do with it.

01:38.751 --> 01:41.823
I will answer a couple of questions
if you just leave her alone. Please.

01:41.858 --> 01:44.373
Brad, why'd you
beat up that bartender?

01:45.071 --> 01:47.639
I didn't beat anybody up.
We had a misunderstanding.

01:47.674 --> 01:50.369
- Were you drinking?
- I was at a bar, Eric.

01:50.404 --> 01:53.515
Yeah, I had a drink... or two.
And some peanuts.

01:53.550 --> 01:56.561
Listen, I gotta get to work.

01:56.596 --> 01:59.646
Just, please, stay off the property
and-and leave Susan alone.

01:59.681 --> 02:00.884
That would be great.

02:01.575 --> 02:02.958
What are you doing!

02:03.493 --> 02:04.755
Susan?

02:14.465 --> 02:15.848
Somebody call the police!

02:15.883 --> 02:17.083
She's been stabbed!

02:18.375 --> 02:19.474
Get the gate!

02:26.102 --> 02:28.879
Does anybody know C. P. R.
or-or first aid or something?

02:28.914 --> 02:30.781
Anything!
Can anybody help me?

02:30.816 --> 02:32.589
She's bleeding really, really bad!

02:33.005 --> 02:34.757
Hello. This is...
This is Brad Terry!

02:34.792 --> 02:36.463
I need an ambulance!

02:36.498 --> 02:37.964
Yes.

02:37.999 --> 02:41.402
2245 Hadley Lane.
My ex-wife, she's been...

02:41.437 --> 02:42.843
She's been stabbed!
She's bleeding really bad!

02:42.878 --> 02:44.227
I think she's dead!

02:44.262 --> 02:46.120
Yes! I'll stay on the line!

02:52.146 --> 02:54.260
MONK Season 2 Epi. 12
Mr. Monk and the T. V. Star

03:51.670 --> 03:54.834
This is Brooke Burke with
breaking news from San Francisco.

03:54.869 --> 03:57.142
It's been a terrible week for Brad Terry,

03:57.177 --> 04:00.344
star of TV's hit series Crime Lab S. F.

04:00.379 --> 04:03.962
Two days ago, Brad was
arrested for assaulting a bartender.

04:03.997 --> 04:07.705
This morning, his ex-wife...
former actress Susan Malloy...

04:07.740 --> 04:11.889
was slain while Brad was standing
right over there, talking to reporters.

04:11.924 --> 04:14.053
Adrian. How do I look?

04:14.088 --> 04:16.538
Sharona, this is a murder scene,
not a high school prom.

04:16.572 --> 04:19.562
Yes, but it was Brad Terry's ex-wife.
Brad Terry could be in there.

04:19.596 --> 04:21.534
Wait, wait. Do I have
anything in my teeth?

04:30.888 --> 04:32.694
Forget it.
Come on. Come on.

04:33.580 --> 04:37.033
This morning, paparazzi gathered to
get the scoop on Brad and Susan.

04:38.629 --> 04:40.028
Excuse me. Hey, hey!

04:40.063 --> 04:41.697
Excuse me.
Are you gonna go see Brad?

04:41.732 --> 04:42.878
Yeah.

04:42.913 --> 04:44.777
Come here.
You could do this for me.

04:44.812 --> 04:46.952
- Sorry.
- No, no. I need...

04:46.987 --> 04:49.531
This is a petition to get
the old theme song back.

04:49.566 --> 04:50.766
They changed the theme song.

04:50.801 --> 04:53.060
Oh, my God!
I hate that new theme song.

04:53.095 --> 04:56.977
Me too. God, the show was perfect.
It was perfection, right?

04:57.012 --> 04:58.965
It was.
It was... It was perfect.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.631
Why can't they just
leave shows alone?

05:00.666 --> 05:03.587
I don't know. - But tell Brad
this is from Marci.

05:03.622 --> 05:05.597
That is me.
"M" for Marci.

05:05.632 --> 05:06.900
"Marci." Okay.

05:06.935 --> 05:08.680
Yeah. He-He knows me, so...

05:08.715 --> 05:10.506
- Okay. I'll tell him that. Okay.
- Come on.

05:11.258 --> 05:12.783
Don't bend it.

05:12.818 --> 05:15.640
Don't forget the upstairs.
I want pictures of everything.

05:15.675 --> 05:18.483
Dylan, grab a couple of uniforms.
Go door-to-door.

05:18.518 --> 05:21.978
And do not send anything upstream
until I get a chance to read it.

05:22.753 --> 05:24.925
I'm glad you're on the case, Captain.

05:25.540 --> 05:28.715
I feel pretty silly doing what I do,
watching you do it for real.

05:29.253 --> 05:31.401
Yeah, I've seen your show.

05:31.635 --> 05:33.574
It's pretty good.

05:33.609 --> 05:35.041
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:35.076 --> 05:37.655
That's a big compliment
coming from you. Thanks.

05:39.505 --> 05:41.780
There he is.
There he is.

05:43.580 --> 05:45.905
The greatest detective
in San Francisco.

05:45.940 --> 05:48.894
Okay, you understand
he's not a real detective?

05:48.929 --> 05:51.157
It's what they call a show.

05:53.961 --> 05:55.710
I'm gonna talk to him.

06:06.170 --> 06:09.052
Mr. Terry? Hi.

06:09.087 --> 06:11.892
I'm really sorry
about your loss.

06:12.267 --> 06:15.906
I'm-I'm Sharona Fleming.
I'm with Adrian Monk.

06:17.295 --> 06:19.103
The consultant, right?

06:19.138 --> 06:21.014
Yeah.

06:21.208 --> 06:23.611
Is there anything
I can do for you?

06:23.791 --> 06:26.977
No. I don't think
it's really hit me yet that...

06:30.143 --> 06:33.195
Well, this...
this is for you.

06:33.230 --> 06:36.136
Somebody outside gave it to me.

06:36.171 --> 06:39.711
It's a petition about
that new theme song.

06:39.878 --> 06:43.485
Oh, yeah. I know. Everybody hates it.
Am I the only one who likes this?

06:43.520 --> 06:46.115
I like it too.

06:46.150 --> 06:48.720
I can't get it out of my mind.
It-It's a good song.

06:48.755 --> 06:51.227
From Marci, right?
Marci Maven.

06:51.262 --> 06:53.661
She follows me everywhere.

06:54.137 --> 06:55.966
She's not right.

06:57.007 --> 06:59.514
So, they were...
They were divorced?

06:59.784 --> 07:02.400
- Who was?
- Brad Terry and the victim.

07:04.336 --> 07:06.782
Yeah, right.
For three years.

07:06.817 --> 07:10.383
They were still friendly.
You know, show people.

07:11.301 --> 07:14.578
He's been hidin' out here
for the last couple of days.

07:14.613 --> 07:16.971
- Hiding from...
- Paparazzi.

07:17.006 --> 07:19.692
He slugged a bartender on Friday night.
It was big news.

07:19.727 --> 07:21.855
Why is this thing still running?

07:31.989 --> 07:34.097
Sorry.

07:35.806 --> 07:38.153
She was working out.

07:38.188 --> 07:39.870
Yeah. She's workin' out here.

07:39.905 --> 07:42.852
Killer opens the back door,
sneaks up behind her,

07:42.887 --> 07:47.645
stabs her three times...
neck, back and chest.

07:49.193 --> 07:51.141
Murder weapon's
nothing special either.

07:51.176 --> 07:52.816
It's just a camping knife.

07:53.190 --> 07:54.472
Here, look at this.

07:55.452 --> 07:57.281
Point of entry.

07:59.726 --> 08:02.060
- How is he?
- He's okay.

08:02.414 --> 08:03.555
I like him.

08:03.590 --> 08:06.768
Like a regular guy.
Like me or you.

08:06.944 --> 08:08.648
Or me.

08:11.585 --> 08:13.102
Do you think
he could have had a motive?

08:13.137 --> 08:14.566
Who?

08:14.601 --> 08:15.951
Brad Terry?

08:15.986 --> 08:17.233
Nah, I don't think so.

08:17.268 --> 08:20.093
No kids. No alimony.
Besides, he can't be the guy.

08:20.128 --> 08:23.348
He was out front when it went down.
Ten witnesses with cameras.

08:23.383 --> 08:27.352
Killer broke the glass,
opened the door, reached in.

08:27.387 --> 08:28.776
Went out the same way.

08:28.811 --> 08:31.244
There's-There's
glass in the track...

08:31.279 --> 08:33.390
directly under the door.

08:33.424 --> 08:34.844
Yeah. So?

08:34.879 --> 08:38.403
I think the door was open
when the glass was broken.

08:39.770 --> 08:42.679
Or the killer kicked the glass
around when he ran out.

08:42.714 --> 08:45.935
This driveway curves
around the back of the house.

08:45.970 --> 08:47.343
Hey, Brad.

08:47.677 --> 08:49.514
Brad Terry,
this is Adrian Monk.

08:49.549 --> 08:51.674
This is the guy that,
uh, we're workin'with.

08:51.709 --> 08:53.493
I'm sorry for your loss.

08:53.528 --> 08:57.456
- Thank you.
- I understand you're an actor...

08:57.491 --> 08:59.889
Oh. Oh, no, no.
Don't be insulted by him.

08:59.924 --> 09:01.777
He's never heard of anybody.

09:01.812 --> 09:05.549
No. He doesn't have to watch my show.
He lives it. Right?

09:05.584 --> 09:08.713
Well, not really.

09:08.748 --> 09:10.732
Well, maybe.

09:10.988 --> 09:13.443
Yes. Yeah, I-I guess so.

09:13.478 --> 09:16.322
I just have a couple of questions.

09:16.411 --> 09:18.751
Is that your car parked
at the bottom of the driveway?

09:18.786 --> 09:19.973
Yeah.

09:20.008 --> 09:23.421
I was just wondering
wh-why you parked out front...

09:23.456 --> 09:26.799
if you didn't want anyone
to know where you were.

09:27.890 --> 09:29.495
That's a good question.

09:30.071 --> 09:33.517
Susan drove it last.
I guess she just forgot to pull it up.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.223
Makes sense to me.

09:36.258 --> 09:37.228
Yeah.

09:37.263 --> 09:39.078
What do you think?

09:40.260 --> 09:41.605
What can I get you two?

09:41.640 --> 09:43.263
Nothing for me.

09:43.298 --> 09:44.806
Just some water.

09:45.162 --> 09:47.205
Are you Dustin Sheers?

09:47.240 --> 09:48.586
Yeah.

09:48.621 --> 09:52.268
We're working with the police
on the Brad Terry case.

09:52.303 --> 09:54.429
- What do I owe you?
- Don't worry about it.

09:54.464 --> 09:57.199
I understand Mr. Terry
was in here last week.

09:57.234 --> 10:00.571
- There was a fight.
- My brush with fame.

10:00.606 --> 10:02.642
Well, actually, it was more
than a brush really.

10:02.677 --> 10:03.876
What was the fight about?

10:03.911 --> 10:05.139
Nothin;

10:05.174 --> 10:08.394
I said I'd never seen
his show, and he flipped out.

10:08.429 --> 10:10.649
He jumps over the bar.
He starts goin'postal on me.

10:10.684 --> 10:12.125
Excuse me.

10:12.160 --> 10:14.360
I'll have some of that scotch.

10:15.157 --> 10:18.193
- It's 20 bucks.
- No, not the whole bottle. Just a glass.

10:18.228 --> 10:21.294
Yeah. Twenty bucks.
It's the best in the house.

10:21.869 --> 10:23.911
What are you doing?

10:23.946 --> 10:25.841
You don't drink.

10:27.578 --> 10:31.525
I get it. You're gonna waste
20 bucks to make 'em even.

10:31.560 --> 10:34.008
Great.
Oh, my God.

10:34.043 --> 10:35.955
- You want this?
- Sure.

10:39.672 --> 10:41.643
Was Mr. Terry intoxicated?

10:41.678 --> 10:42.965
Had to be.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.185
- How else do you explain that?
- I'll have a glass of water, please.

10:46.785 --> 10:49.429
You're not gonna
sue him, are you?

10:49.822 --> 10:51.553
I considered it,

10:51.668 --> 10:55.983
but I figure, after what
happened with his ex-wife,

10:56.013 --> 10:58.178
that guy's suffered enough.

10:59.969 --> 11:01.696
I'll have another scotch.

11:08.560 --> 11:10.046
Don't mind if I do.

11:10.520 --> 11:12.824
Besides, he felt
pretty bad about it.

11:12.859 --> 11:16.104
Before the cops showed up,
he wrote me a check for two grand.

11:16.139 --> 11:17.810
He wrote him a check.

11:17.881 --> 11:20.110
That's the check?
That's it.

11:20.145 --> 11:22.534
I don't know whether
to cash it or frame it.

11:23.880 --> 11:25.123
What's wrong?

11:25.158 --> 11:27.391
- The handwriting.
- Looks okay to me.

11:27.426 --> 11:30.091
It's not just okay.
It's perfect.

11:30.126 --> 11:32.632
He stayed right on the line.

11:32.667 --> 11:34.981
I don't think he was drunk
when he wrote this.

11:35.016 --> 11:37.913
Why would a star like Brad
Terry pretend to be drunk?

11:37.948 --> 11:39.296
Please.

11:39.331 --> 11:41.533
I'll have some more water, please.

11:41.928 --> 11:43.333
Can you make it a double?

11:45.670 --> 11:47.458
There's the editing
rooms over there.

11:47.493 --> 11:49.717
That's the costume department.

11:49.752 --> 11:52.204
Are they allowed to
keep all the clothes?

11:52.239 --> 11:55.201
Well, they're not supposed to,
but sometimes they do.

11:55.236 --> 11:57.557
Could you slow it down a little, please?

11:57.592 --> 11:59.775
I don't think I can go any slower.

11:59.810 --> 12:03.152
I'm surprised Brad Terry is
working today, after what happened.

12:03.187 --> 12:05.600
Oh, yeah. They just keep
workin', no matter what.

12:05.635 --> 12:08.258
You know, they have
to do 26 episodes a year.

12:08.330 --> 12:10.971
Brad wouldn't shut us down.
He's great.

12:11.006 --> 12:13.072
- Oh, He... He is great.
- Yeah, he's great.

12:13.107 --> 12:16.959
- I can't seem to find my seat belt.
- You don't need a seat belt.

12:16.994 --> 12:18.905
I don't need a seat belt.

12:18.940 --> 12:20.850
Oh. Over there's
the dubbing stage.

12:20.885 --> 12:23.420
That's where we do
all the sound work for the show.

12:23.455 --> 12:24.380
Hey.

12:24.415 --> 12:27.078
- Is he anybody?
- No. He's just a writer.

12:27.113 --> 12:29.417
"100th."
100th what?

12:29.452 --> 12:31.703
We're shooting our
hundredth episode this week.

12:31.738 --> 12:33.624
Yeah, it-it's a really big deal.

12:33.659 --> 12:34.808
Why is that?

12:34.843 --> 12:38.821
Because they can syndicate the show.
That's where they make the big money.

12:39.888 --> 12:41.294
Okay. Well,

12:41.329 --> 12:42.659
here we are.

12:42.694 --> 12:44.082
- We made it.
- Yeah.

12:44.117 --> 12:46.016
It's the big door on the left.

12:46.051 --> 12:49.452
- Thank you so much. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

12:49.487 --> 12:50.517
Bye.

12:50.552 --> 12:52.572
A camera, Sharona?

12:52.607 --> 12:55.087
He's a murder suspect.

12:55.301 --> 12:57.012
Brad Terry didn't kill anybody.

12:57.047 --> 12:59.856
How do you know?
Because he plays a nice guy on TV.

12:59.891 --> 13:03.174
Tony Danza never killed anybody.
Mister Rogers never killed anybody.

13:03.209 --> 13:05.328
I'm not saying every
actor is a murderer.

13:05.363 --> 13:08.748
I'm saying this actor
might be a murderer.

13:08.783 --> 13:10.982
Do I have to agree
with you on every case?

13:11.017 --> 13:12.926
- Is that, like, a rule?
- No.

13:12.961 --> 13:14.857
Well, you're wrong.

13:14.892 --> 13:16.829
He didn't do it.

13:25.257 --> 13:27.978
The door was locked
from the inside.

13:28.878 --> 13:31.648
The hooker must have come
in through the fire escape.

13:31.983 --> 13:33.987
Minute traces of
blood over here.

13:34.022 --> 13:35.657
Rusty?

13:35.692 --> 13:38.464
- Over here.
- What do you got, J.?

13:39.264 --> 13:40.913
It looks like a fiber.

13:41.330 --> 13:43.764
What planet are
they supposed to be on?

13:46.144 --> 13:48.157
J, don't touch it.

13:48.773 --> 13:51.312
Lee, get the spectroscope.

13:58.855 --> 14:00.747
What the hell is that?

14:00.782 --> 14:02.641
A spectroscope.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.862
It's how they solve the crimes.

14:04.897 --> 14:07.251
- We should get one.
- Why don't we get two?

14:07.286 --> 14:09.413
Then we can solve
'em twice as fast.

14:14.638 --> 14:16.024
It's fiber all right.

14:16.059 --> 14:19.018
It's some sort of strange,
synthetic polymer.

14:19.534 --> 14:23.082
Lee, speak English, please.

14:23.117 --> 14:24.905
It's not domestic.

14:24.940 --> 14:27.263
It was made in Bolivia.

14:28.830 --> 14:31.520
The Santorini cartel.

14:31.995 --> 14:33.513
Santorini?

14:33.548 --> 14:35.526
That-That's in Greece.

14:36.041 --> 14:38.136
What can I help you
with, Mr. Monk?

14:39.456 --> 14:42.910
Well, this is your 100th episode.
Is that right?

14:43.948 --> 14:46.492
Congratulations.
I understand that's a big day for you.

14:46.527 --> 14:48.210
Thank you.
Yeah, a big one.

14:48.245 --> 14:51.619
I've been workin' a long time for it...
my whole life actually.

14:51.710 --> 14:57.872
And how does that work? I know that you
weren't paying Susan alimony. But, uh,

14:57.907 --> 15:01.413
when the show started,
you were still married, right?

15:01.448 --> 15:04.579
- Yes, I was.
- Under California law,

15:04.614 --> 15:08.806
she would have been entitled to
half of any syndication money.

15:08.841 --> 15:11.581
You think you've found a motive,
don't you, Mr. Monk?

15:11.771 --> 15:14.218
Would you like me to take a lie
detector test? Would that make you happy?

15:14.253 --> 15:16.241
Yes, it would.

15:16.276 --> 15:18.313
Anytime, anywhere.

15:18.348 --> 15:19.939
Oh, excuse me.

15:19.974 --> 15:21.880
- You mind?
- Oh, no, no. Come on.

15:22.013 --> 15:23.576
Okay.
Press that button.

15:25.235 --> 15:26.580
Thank you.

15:34.822 --> 15:35.908
I was at a bar, Eric.

15:35.943 --> 15:39.074
Yeah, I had a drink... or two.
And some peanuts.

15:39.109 --> 15:41.791
The local news has been
running this all-day long.

15:43.095 --> 15:44.742
- What are you doing!
- Susan?

15:45.116 --> 15:49.346
I had the lab run a voiceprint analysis.
That was definitely Susan.

15:49.381 --> 15:51.066
We think the killer was
a deranged fan.

15:51.101 --> 15:52.106
It makes sense to me.

15:52.141 --> 15:54.370
Have you talked to the one
we met, Marci Maven?

15:54.405 --> 15:56.878
No, not yet. We're still
tryin' to track her down.

15:56.913 --> 15:58.524
I asked around.

15:58.559 --> 16:01.458
Do you realize that if this
show goes into syndication,

16:01.493 --> 16:04.971
Brad Terry stands
to make over $20 million?

16:05.006 --> 16:06.526
There's your motive right there.

16:06.561 --> 16:08.871
He did not want to
share it with his ex-wife.

16:08.906 --> 16:10.134
Gentlemen!

16:10.169 --> 16:11.957
Max Green,
the truth machine.

16:11.992 --> 16:13.604
What do you got?

16:13.639 --> 16:16.003
Well, according to this,
he's clean.

16:16.038 --> 16:18.555
He's Mr. Clean.
Zero deception.

16:18.590 --> 16:20.082
You see?

16:21.891 --> 16:24.842
What more do you need?

16:24.877 --> 16:26.591
Come on.

16:27.186 --> 16:29.119
I think you enjoy being alone.

16:29.573 --> 16:32.013
So, did we pass?

16:32.368 --> 16:33.652
Yes, we did.

16:33.687 --> 16:34.712
With flying colors.

16:35.047 --> 16:37.163
I was up all night studying.

16:37.901 --> 16:40.278
Mr. Monk, are you satisfied?

16:40.695 --> 16:43.195
The machine is not infallible.

16:43.230 --> 16:45.634
Well, neither are you.

16:45.669 --> 16:48.344
I've been watching you, Mr. Monk.
That's what actors do.

16:48.379 --> 16:49.650
We... soak people in.

16:49.685 --> 16:53.055
I think I got you.
It's something like...

16:54.753 --> 16:57.259
I don't know
what this thing is, but...

16:57.294 --> 16:58.698
Tidiness.

16:58.733 --> 17:01.013
Everything has to
be in complete... Don't you?

17:01.048 --> 17:02.538
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:03.806 --> 17:06.471
The lamp thing.
I don't know what...

17:06.506 --> 17:09.041
That's-That's nothing...

17:09.077 --> 17:12.409
nothing like me.
Nothing at all really.

17:12.737 --> 17:13.635
- Hey.
- Come on.

17:13.670 --> 17:17.108
There's a big 100th-episode
cast party tonight.

17:17.144 --> 17:18.417
- You're coming.
- I'll be there.

17:18.453 --> 17:19.746
Okay, good.

17:19.781 --> 17:22.759
Sharona, you have to come,
because these parties get a little wild.

17:22.794 --> 17:25.421
- I might need a nurse, you know?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.

17:25.455 --> 17:27.089
Do you mind?

17:27.125 --> 17:28.577
Don't wait up, Mr. Monk.

17:28.612 --> 17:30.266
No, no. You go ahead.

17:33.260 --> 17:34.920
I guess it's just you and me.

17:34.955 --> 17:36.325
Yep.

17:36.360 --> 17:37.504
Brad Terry.

17:38.747 --> 17:40.249
What's your name again?

17:40.321 --> 17:41.900
Randy. Randy.

17:41.935 --> 17:43.525
Randy, you ever
done any acting?

17:43.560 --> 17:44.563
No.

17:44.598 --> 17:47.417
'Cause you got a great energy.
I think you might really pop.

17:47.452 --> 17:49.262
- Pop?
- Come to the party.

17:49.297 --> 17:51.141
I want you to meet
the casting director. Okay?

17:51.176 --> 17:52.322
Okay.

18:10.629 --> 18:14.614
Cast and crew, please put
your hands together for our stars!

18:15.069 --> 18:17.981
Let's hear it for 100 shows!

18:24.757 --> 18:26.871
100 shows.

18:27.167 --> 18:29.684
To be honest with you,
I didn't think we'd make it past 10.

18:31.718 --> 18:36.344
Listen, I want to thank everybody
for-for your support this week.

18:36.379 --> 18:38.338
Susan's murder was a...

18:42.631 --> 18:44.298
Sorry. It was a terrible tragedy,

18:44.333 --> 18:47.820
and-and I wanna thank everybody
for stickin' by me this week.

18:47.855 --> 18:53.059
I really appreciate it. You guys were
there for me, and I will never forget it.

18:53.777 --> 18:55.181
We really are a family.

18:56.267 --> 18:58.459
Except, unlike most families,
we actually like each other.

19:00.378 --> 19:02.960
Listen, congratulations, everybody.

19:02.995 --> 19:04.406
Let's get drunk.

19:55.159 --> 20:00.803
On TV, you always see one cop
in one car hot-roddin' after some suspect.

20:00.838 --> 20:02.613
It doesn't happen like that.

20:02.648 --> 20:06.651
Believe it or not, we're out there
trying to serve and protect.

20:11.729 --> 20:12.919
It's a great party, huh?

20:12.954 --> 20:14.304
Move, move, move!
You're in the picture.

20:14.339 --> 20:16.178
- Move. Move.
- Sorry. Sorry.

20:19.106 --> 20:20.691
You wanna dance?

20:23.120 --> 20:24.310
Oh, well,

20:24.345 --> 20:26.386
I'm not much of a dancer.

20:27.880 --> 20:29.812
Hey. Hey.

20:29.847 --> 20:31.055
There she is.
Sharona, hi.

20:31.090 --> 20:33.191
- Hi.
- How are ya?

20:33.997 --> 20:37.123
- You wanna dance?
- Oh, she's not much of a dancer.

20:37.377 --> 20:39.448
Oh, that's okay.
I can teach her.

20:39.483 --> 20:40.893
Come on
Let's dance.

20:46.738 --> 20:48.245
That was a good line.

20:54.016 --> 20:55.480
Greetings from your friends

20:55.515 --> 20:57.876
Adrian, I'm so proud of you. Mom.

21:23.765 --> 21:26.285
Brad, hi,
Brad. Hey. Brad.

21:26.320 --> 21:28.337
Hey, Marci.
What are you doing here?

21:28.372 --> 21:31.224
I hid in the ladies' room upstairs.

21:32.266 --> 21:34.014
Well, good to see ya.

21:34.332 --> 21:36.780
Brad, no. Hey, Brad.
I have to tell you something.

21:36.815 --> 21:39.204
- It's really important.
- Yeah, maybe that can wai...

21:39.239 --> 21:42.177
Hey, Marci. How are you?
We've been lookin' for you.

21:42.212 --> 21:43.725
Oh. No, I've gotta talk to Brad.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.929
No, no, Marci.
You have to talk to us.

21:46.970 --> 21:48.295
Okay, Marci. Come on.

21:48.330 --> 21:49.732
Keep dancing.

21:49.767 --> 21:50.948
Comin'through.
Excuse me.

21:50.983 --> 21:53.315
- Oh, no. I have to talk to Brad.
- This way.

21:53.350 --> 21:54.679
Come on.

21:54.714 --> 21:57.787
He's seducing them all,
one by one.

21:57.822 --> 22:00.559
It's easy for him.
He's an actor.

22:00.975 --> 22:03.524
He lies for a living.

22:04.019 --> 22:07.862
Yeah, but you could say that
he tells the truth for a living.

22:11.276 --> 22:13.539
There was a cast party last night.

22:13.574 --> 22:16.700
- Everybody went.
- Except you.

22:17.438 --> 22:19.430
How did that make you feel?

22:21.626 --> 22:24.491
Like I was back in sixth grade.

22:26.050 --> 22:29.248
There was this kid...
Robbie Walover.

22:30.300 --> 22:32.353
He was a great athlete.

22:32.388 --> 22:35.182
He was funny.
Everybody liked him.

22:35.217 --> 22:39.232
That year, he invited everyone
to his birthday party...

22:40.332 --> 22:41.819
except me.

22:45.273 --> 22:47.894
Here I am,

22:48.835 --> 22:51.619
still in the sixth grade.

22:55.333 --> 22:59.226
Robbie Walover. Did-Did he
live over on Hillside Avenue?

23:01.744 --> 23:04.792
- Yes.
- I knew him.

23:05.205 --> 23:09.375
My mother was friendly
with his mother.

23:09.410 --> 23:13.259
Were you at the party?

23:13.329 --> 23:14.968
Yeah.

23:16.212 --> 23:17.420
Was it great?

23:17.455 --> 23:19.699
Adrian, you don't wanna know.

23:19.734 --> 23:20.738
No, no.

23:20.773 --> 23:22.498
Okay, yes.
Okay, fine.

23:22.533 --> 23:25.249
It was...
Yes, it was, um...

23:25.284 --> 23:27.061
It was pretty great.

23:28.001 --> 23:32.022
Yeah, it was great.
We went to Candlestick Park.

23:34.650 --> 23:36.975
I met Willie Mays.

23:47.156 --> 23:49.674
- Where have you been?
- We had to parallel park.

23:49.709 --> 23:50.822
What, for 20 minutes?

23:50.857 --> 23:53.487
Parallel means parallel, right?
That's all I'm saying.

23:53.522 --> 23:54.483
Whatever.
Come on.

23:54.518 --> 23:55.707
I want you to hear something.

23:55.742 --> 23:57.526
What is it?
You said it was big.

23:57.561 --> 24:01.271
Monk, you're a great detective,
but nobody bats a thousand.

24:03.975 --> 24:06.585
Marci Maven,
this is Adrian Monk.

24:06.620 --> 24:08.245
He's working
on the case with us.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.217
Yeah, I remember you.

24:10.450 --> 24:14.217
Now, Marci, I want you to tell him
exactly what you've been telling us.

24:17.383 --> 24:19.215
I did it.

24:21.208 --> 24:25.057
I killed Brad's ex, Susan Malloy.

24:27.589 --> 24:29.867
I did the world a favor.

24:29.902 --> 24:31.658
She was a terrible actress.

24:31.693 --> 24:33.238
Who was?

24:33.273 --> 24:34.949
Susan Malloy.

24:34.984 --> 24:38.487
The bitch... I killed.

24:38.522 --> 24:42.009
She only made one movie. What kind
of actress only makes one movie?

24:42.044 --> 24:44.317
Frat Party Massacre.
Did you see it?

24:44.352 --> 24:46.349
- Uh, no.
- I did.

24:46.643 --> 24:48.391
Like, 20 times.

24:48.426 --> 24:50.483
And how did you do it, Marci?

24:50.518 --> 24:51.818
It was easy.

24:51.853 --> 24:53.790
Snuck in the glass
window in the back.

24:53.825 --> 24:55.515
I hid. She came in.

24:55.550 --> 24:57.965
She was, uh,
doin' an exercise tape.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.815
She didn't even see me.

25:00.232 --> 25:02.963
I pulled out the knife,
and she started screaming.

25:02.998 --> 25:05.582
I started stabbing, and...

25:05.617 --> 25:07.214
I stabbed her.

25:07.529 --> 25:09.357
How many times?

25:09.392 --> 25:10.663
Three or four.

25:10.698 --> 25:12.533
Why did you do it, Marci?

25:13.720 --> 25:15.555
I did it for Brad.

25:17.164 --> 25:18.741
Hello?

25:18.776 --> 25:19.943
I love him.

25:19.978 --> 25:21.768
You know, I...

25:21.803 --> 25:24.104
That bitch broke his heart.

25:26.705 --> 25:29.942
She won't be hurting
him anymore. Right?

25:29.977 --> 25:31.104
I don't know.

25:31.139 --> 25:33.896
Sharona and I saw her a half
an hour after the murder.

25:33.931 --> 25:35.198
There was no blood on her shirt.

25:35.233 --> 25:36.644
She explained that.

25:36.679 --> 25:38.324
She said she went back
to her car and changed.

25:38.359 --> 25:41.233
What happened to the bloody clothes? Where
are they? - Monk, we have a confession.

25:41.268 --> 25:43.016
A confession trumps
a missing blouse.

25:43.051 --> 25:46.185
Plus, a videotape puts Brad Terry
in the front yard during the attack.

25:46.220 --> 25:47.909
And also...
we have a confession.

25:47.944 --> 25:49.779
And he passed
a polygraph test.

25:49.814 --> 25:52.571
And did I mention
we have a confession?

26:01.065 --> 26:03.403
Okay. Okay.

26:03.438 --> 26:06.326
Okay, you win.

26:06.560 --> 26:08.219
I'm convinced.

26:08.254 --> 26:09.279
He's innocent.

26:09.314 --> 26:11.170
- Yes!
- We have a verdict.

26:11.205 --> 26:13.939
All right. As far as I'm concerned,
this case is closed.

26:13.974 --> 26:16.046
Call the D. A. I wanna file this
first thing in the morning.

26:16.081 --> 26:17.697
- Yes, sir.
- Monk.

26:19.679 --> 26:21.144
Thank you.
Thank you.

26:21.179 --> 26:24.259
Now I can take that job. I'm gonna be
a police consultant on the show.

26:24.294 --> 26:26.531
No way. - A thousand dollars
for half a day's work.

26:26.566 --> 26:29.020
I couldn't have
taken the gig until you...

26:29.055 --> 26:31.507
- agreed the guy was innocent.
- I appreciate that.

26:31.542 --> 26:34.280
And, uh, I can take
the part they offered me.

26:34.315 --> 26:36.007
I got a line on the next episode.

26:36.461 --> 26:40.124
Oh, my God! Hey, hey, hey.
I can bring Benjy to the set.

26:40.159 --> 26:41.346
This is great.

26:41.381 --> 26:43.524
A thousand dollars
for half a day's work? - Yes.

26:43.559 --> 26:46.389
Hey. You guys can come
to my trailer if you want. - Okay.

26:46.424 --> 26:48.200
Wait. You can consult me too.

26:51.430 --> 26:52.626
Hey, Monk.

26:52.661 --> 26:54.895
- Thanks.
- Hey.

26:54.930 --> 26:56.279
Yeah.

26:56.531 --> 26:59.244
I think I'm finally gettin'
the hang of sixth grade.

27:03.578 --> 27:06.271
It's all one motion.
Cuffs are out,

27:06.306 --> 27:09.385
right hand down,
cuffs are on.

27:10.681 --> 27:11.981
It's like you're dancing.

27:12.016 --> 27:14.338
Screw the backup.
Screw the backup. I'm goin' in.

27:14.373 --> 27:15.681
Screw the backup. I'm goin'...

27:15.716 --> 27:17.521
Do I sound like a real cop?

27:17.556 --> 27:19.879
You'll never sound
like a real cop.

27:19.914 --> 27:21.543
Don't be afraid to
push him around.

27:21.578 --> 27:24.313
It's a bad guy. You know.

27:24.971 --> 27:27.201
Yeah.

27:35.358 --> 27:37.421
So, mom, are we really
gonna see Brad Terry?

27:37.456 --> 27:39.229
Yeah.

27:39.232 --> 27:40.374
Well, where is he?

27:40.409 --> 27:42.391
He's in his trailer with Mr. Monk.

27:43.563 --> 27:45.105
What can I say?
I'm really sorry.

27:45.140 --> 27:47.159
You can stop
apologizing, Mr. Monk.

27:47.194 --> 27:48.262
You were just doing your job.

27:48.297 --> 27:51.956
No. No, no, no.
I wasn't thinking straight.

27:52.371 --> 27:56.725
You reminded me of this kid
I knew in sixth grade.

27:56.760 --> 27:58.323
Ah, it's complicated.

27:58.358 --> 28:00.072
We all have our demons, right?

28:00.588 --> 28:03.290
So the case is officially closed.
Marci confessed.

28:03.325 --> 28:04.640
That's right.

28:04.675 --> 28:07.370
See, I always knew
she was unstable. She, uh...

28:07.421 --> 28:09.649
Come in. She's been
harassing me for years.

28:09.684 --> 28:11.013
- Hi.
- Hey, Laurie. How are you?

28:11.048 --> 28:12.965
- I got your water.
- Thanks.

28:13.590 --> 28:15.235
Sierra Springs.

28:15.270 --> 28:17.347
I drink that too.

28:17.382 --> 28:18.965
Yeah? Here.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.256
We get 'em for free
'cause I drink it on the show.

28:21.291 --> 28:23.866
- Gotta love them perks.
- I love them perks.

28:25.223 --> 28:28.199
Brad, did you get a chance
to read my script?

28:28.234 --> 28:31.604
Yes. Oh, yeah... I'm sorry.
I was gonna call you. It was great.

28:31.639 --> 28:33.214
Really? You liked it?

28:33.249 --> 28:35.389
Yeah. It was the best script
I've read all year.

28:35.424 --> 28:39.802
I loved the-the crazy uncle
and the, um, road trip.

28:39.837 --> 28:41.086
That's excellent, yeah.

28:41.121 --> 28:42.786
That actually happened.

28:42.821 --> 28:43.750
Really?

28:43.785 --> 28:46.583
Listen, if you don't mind...
and feel free to say no...

28:46.618 --> 28:49.830
I was gonna pass it on to my agent,
see what he thinks.

28:49.865 --> 28:52.705
Sure, yeah.
My God, that would be awesome.

28:52.740 --> 28:54.261
Thank you so much.

28:54.296 --> 28:55.524
First team on set.

28:55.559 --> 28:58.104
Uh, break's over.
We need you on set.

28:58.139 --> 28:59.302
Okay.

28:59.924 --> 29:02.382
Well, I gotta go solve
a couple of homicides.

29:02.417 --> 29:03.951
- You wanna watch?
- Sure.

29:04.910 --> 29:07.502
Okay, everybody!
Places!

29:07.673 --> 29:09.092
And... rain!

29:09.127 --> 29:11.452
Places. Background action.

29:11.487 --> 29:13.150
And action!

29:14.091 --> 29:16.225
Where you goin' to,
Frankie? Huh?

29:16.698 --> 29:18.428
You goin'to church?

29:23.099 --> 29:24.218
Cocaine.

29:31.057 --> 29:32.078
It's pure.

29:32.113 --> 29:33.570
And cut!

29:33.605 --> 29:35.286
- Save the rain.
- Okay, let's go again.

29:35.321 --> 29:37.855
Okay! Quickly, quickly! Reset!

29:40.306 --> 29:42.834
We're doing it again!
Everybody back to one!

29:43.145 --> 29:44.245
They're doing it again?

29:44.280 --> 29:45.915
Yeah. They do the same
scene over and over.

29:45.950 --> 29:48.199
Then later on, they put
all the pieces together.

29:48.234 --> 29:49.724
It's called editing.

29:50.037 --> 29:51.850
Listen to Mr. Hollywood.

29:52.620 --> 29:54.611
And action!

29:55.775 --> 29:58.285
Where you goin' to, Frankie? Huh?

29:58.320 --> 29:59.714
You goin' to church?

30:01.968 --> 30:03.575
Cocaine.

30:10.056 --> 30:11.309
It's pure.

30:11.344 --> 30:12.652
- Cut!
- Cut!

30:12.687 --> 30:14.965
He used a different finger.
It won't cut together.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.507
Oh, you're right.

30:16.542 --> 30:19.472
Uh, Brad.
Brad, listen.

30:19.507 --> 30:22.770
Make sure you use
your right pinkie, okay?

30:22.805 --> 30:24.989
Yeah.
Sorry.

30:25.024 --> 30:26.456
No problem.

30:26.491 --> 30:29.146
Excuse me.
I noticed something else.

30:29.181 --> 30:32.645
The second time,
the lights on the van were off.

30:32.680 --> 30:34.596
He's right.
I missed that one.

30:34.631 --> 30:37.706
Carl.
Your lights.

30:38.342 --> 30:41.074
And, uh, this-this...

30:41.109 --> 30:45.707
This gentleman in the brown shirt
by the pizza place, he, uh...

30:45.922 --> 30:49.725
The first time, both his socks
were pulled all the way up.

30:49.760 --> 30:51.759
But the second time,
one was down.

30:51.794 --> 30:53.944
And, uh, you, sir...

30:53.979 --> 30:58.559
Sir? Your umbrella handle
was turned, uh, this way.

30:58.594 --> 31:01.390
And, uh, you...
Sir, you...

31:01.425 --> 31:04.428
You were holding your coffee cup
with your pinkie extended.

31:04.463 --> 31:07.198
Not-Not... Not that much.
Not that much.

31:07.233 --> 31:08.381
And her sweater...

31:08.416 --> 31:10.950
Her sweater was buttoned up,
you know, all the way.

31:10.985 --> 31:16.192
And, uh, she looked at
her watch like this the first time.

31:16.227 --> 31:20.651
And he-he scratched his elbow,
and her straw was bent a little more.

31:20.686 --> 31:22.169
Thank you, Mr. Monk.

31:22.204 --> 31:24.883
Her zipper on her bag
was all the way up.

31:24.918 --> 31:26.573
You're a very observant
man, Mr. Monk.

31:26.608 --> 31:28.800
I don't think there's anything you can do
about the bird, but, on the first take...

31:28.835 --> 31:30.210
It's okay.

31:30.245 --> 31:32.641
It doesn't have to be perfect.

31:32.676 --> 31:34.758
Could we take a break?

31:34.793 --> 31:38.162
- Let's take a break.
- Break! Everybody back in 10!

31:43.164 --> 31:45.638
Sorry. He's kind of a perfectionist.

31:45.774 --> 31:47.582
Hey. Hey.

31:56.365 --> 31:58.115
- Hi.
- Hey, Laurie.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.483
Did you, uh...

32:00.909 --> 32:02.515
Captain, do you think...

32:02.550 --> 32:04.336
I think they need to
shove the criminal harder.

32:04.371 --> 32:05.815
Yeah. You're right.

32:05.850 --> 32:08.892
Yeah. That was lame.

32:11.343 --> 32:14.813
- Have you read Laurie's script?
- No. Is it any good?

32:14.848 --> 32:17.200
It is the worst script
I have ever read.

32:17.235 --> 32:18.728
That figures.

32:20.622 --> 32:22.026
- Sharona.
- What?

32:22.061 --> 32:24.015
Brad.

32:24.050 --> 32:26.505
He lied to that girl
about her script.

32:26.540 --> 32:27.981
I was there.

32:28.016 --> 32:30.165
So what?
He was being polite.

32:30.200 --> 32:32.279
No. No, no, no, no.

32:32.314 --> 32:35.577
He was... He was wearing
one of those pulse monitors.

32:35.612 --> 32:37.903
His heartbeat didn't change,
not a fraction.

32:37.938 --> 32:39.339
He's a sociopath.

32:39.374 --> 32:42.173
That's how he beat
the polygraph test.

32:42.208 --> 32:44.193
He did it.

32:44.649 --> 32:45.750
He's the guy.

32:45.785 --> 32:48.400
- He can't be the guy.
- He's the guy.

32:48.920 --> 32:50.405
He's the guy.

32:55.663 --> 32:57.636
How do you feel, Marci?

32:57.771 --> 33:00.067
How do I feel?

33:00.102 --> 33:03.546
Well, th-that's funny, because
I've talked to five psychiatrists...

33:03.581 --> 33:07.653
and-and three psychologists
and one therapist.

33:07.688 --> 33:10.830
And, uh, they all wanted
to know the same thing.

33:10.865 --> 33:14.000
"How you feelin', Marci?
How you feelin', Marci?"

33:14.035 --> 33:17.987
I heard that you got into
some trouble last night.

33:18.948 --> 33:22.856
I smashed the TV in the rec room.
What was I supposed to do?

33:22.891 --> 33:28.842
Crime Lab S. F. was on with that...
that new theme song which I hate.

33:28.877 --> 33:30.490
Why do they need
a new theme song?

33:30.525 --> 33:32.383
Marci.

33:32.798 --> 33:35.286
I know you didn't
kill Susan Malloy.

33:35.321 --> 33:36.484
Oh, no.
Sure I did.

33:36.519 --> 33:38.234
No.

33:38.390 --> 33:40.646
You couldn't kill anyone.

33:42.377 --> 33:44.310
Why did you confess?

33:44.345 --> 33:48.115
There's only one reason
why you would... confess.

33:48.150 --> 33:51.090
Because you know
Brad Terry is guilty.

33:52.912 --> 33:54.643
You love him.

33:54.678 --> 33:56.938
You're protecting him.

33:57.073 --> 33:59.096
But how...

33:59.131 --> 34:01.354
do you know he's guilty?

34:01.389 --> 34:03.488
That's the question.

34:03.560 --> 34:06.315
How do you know...

34:06.691 --> 34:08.743
he killed his ex-wife?

34:16.897 --> 34:18.668
Marci.

34:18.902 --> 34:19.882
Marci.

34:24.016 --> 34:26.677
What really happened here?

34:26.712 --> 34:31.184
They went outside together for a minute.
She comes back in alone.

34:31.219 --> 34:32.588
You be Susan.

34:32.623 --> 34:34.806
Great.
So I'm the victim again?

34:37.934 --> 34:39.871
I think you enjoy stabbing
and shooting me.

34:39.906 --> 34:43.300
No, I don't enjoy it,
but it's my job.

34:43.335 --> 34:46.418
Okay, so she comes back
in to start her workout.

34:46.454 --> 34:49.553
And you put in your
favorite exercise video.

34:56.116 --> 34:57.795
I'm sorry. It was turned
all the way up.

34:57.830 --> 34:59.138
Okay...

35:00.504 --> 35:02.721
Okay.

35:03.217 --> 35:05.332
Okay. Wait a minute.

35:05.843 --> 35:10.115
It was turned all the way up
the day she was killed too.

35:10.891 --> 35:13.079
What does that mean?

35:13.114 --> 35:14.484
I don't know.

35:18.270 --> 35:20.447
Let me see that yoga tape.

35:26.415 --> 35:27.998
- It's not here.
- It's right there.

35:28.033 --> 35:29.827
I saw Disher take it out.

35:29.862 --> 35:31.396
It's not here.

35:32.497 --> 35:34.674
What, somebody steal it?

35:34.709 --> 35:37.328
I mean, who would
steal a workout tape?

35:43.698 --> 35:45.223
What?

35:49.558 --> 35:52.856
I know what happened here.

35:55.863 --> 35:57.531
You're not gonna like it.

35:59.644 --> 36:01.091
Just hear me out.

36:01.126 --> 36:02.924
Just keep an open mind.

36:02.959 --> 36:04.920
He did it, didn't he?

36:08.688 --> 36:11.436
There's a reason the coroner
couldn't find a bullet in her body.

36:11.471 --> 36:13.001
There was no bullet to find.

36:13.036 --> 36:14.861
At least no ordinary bullet.

36:14.896 --> 36:17.906
You killed the hooker with a bullet
made from your own frozen blood.

36:17.941 --> 36:19.672
Isn't that right, Senator?

36:19.707 --> 36:20.824
Here's what happened.

36:20.859 --> 36:22.499
All you needed was
an ounce of your blood.

36:22.534 --> 36:25.789
You poured it into
a.38-caliber mold and froze it.

36:25.824 --> 36:27.305
The rest was easy.

36:27.340 --> 36:30.128
You left the fund-raiser at 7:00.

36:30.421 --> 36:32.359
You shot the hooker.

36:35.597 --> 36:38.100
Then you waited for
the blood bullet to dissolve.

36:38.135 --> 36:40.242
Well, you can't prove any of this.

36:40.277 --> 36:42.168
Oh, I think we can.

36:42.203 --> 36:44.618
I think it's fine.
I think the gunshot could be louder.

36:44.653 --> 36:46.389
I can do louder.

36:47.710 --> 36:50.128
This is my favorite part...

36:50.366 --> 36:53.239
where everybody stands around
and you sum up the case.

36:53.274 --> 36:54.843
Yeah. Me too.
Thanks.

36:54.878 --> 36:58.111
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to Mr. Monk.

36:58.525 --> 37:01.654
Why don't you, uh, take a break.

37:03.356 --> 37:06.250
Brad Terry, you're under arrest
for the murder of your ex-wife.

37:06.285 --> 37:07.595
You can't be serious.

37:07.630 --> 37:10.456
I was out on the front lawn the
whole time. Everybody saw me.

37:10.491 --> 37:13.645
You made sure everybody saw
you by pretending to be drunk...

37:13.680 --> 37:16.119
and staging that fight
a few days earlier.

37:16.154 --> 37:19.754
After an incident like that, you knew
the press would follow you anywhere.

37:19.789 --> 37:23.032
That was the whole idea.
You needed witnesses.

37:30.461 --> 37:31.645
I was at a bar, Eric.

37:31.680 --> 37:34.513
Yeah, I had a drink... or two.
And some peanuts.

37:34.548 --> 37:38.736
Listen, stay off the property, please.
Leave Susan out of it.

37:38.771 --> 37:40.811
Okay. Freeze it right there.

37:40.921 --> 37:43.298
That proves it.
I was outside when she screamed.

37:43.333 --> 37:47.528
Oh, yeah, she screamed,
but that scream was 15 years old.

37:48.634 --> 37:50.256
You recognize this?

37:50.291 --> 37:53.189
This is the first movie
your wife ever made.

37:53.224 --> 37:55.132
It took us forever to track it down.

37:55.167 --> 37:57.518
The movie's been out
of print for years.

38:01.505 --> 38:03.355
What are you doing!

38:06.425 --> 38:08.458
What are you doing!

38:08.493 --> 38:09.844
Susan?

38:10.178 --> 38:14.591
Marci Maven recognized the scream 'cause
she's seen the movie a hundred times.

38:14.626 --> 38:17.431
As Special Agent
Rusty Clark would say,

38:17.466 --> 38:19.112
"Here's what happened."

38:19.147 --> 38:22.410
Last week, you came
in here alone after hours.

38:22.445 --> 38:23.917
What are you doing!

38:24.116 --> 38:25.634
No! No!

38:25.849 --> 38:31.929
It was easy to transfer Susan's scream from
the slasher film onto the exercise video.

38:34.914 --> 38:36.341
What are you doing!

38:37.601 --> 38:38.968
The morning of the murder,

38:39.003 --> 38:40.950
you smashed some
glass on the rear door

38:40.985 --> 38:43.104
to make it look like
somebody broke in.

38:43.883 --> 38:47.962
You hid a knife near the front door
where you could grab it quickly.

38:50.423 --> 38:54.329
Then you replaced her exercise video
with the one you doctored,

38:54.364 --> 38:56.372
and the stage was set.

38:57.808 --> 38:59.731
As you planned,
the press was out front,

38:59.766 --> 39:03.132
and you made sure they saw
Susan alive as you left the house.

39:05.296 --> 39:07.755
You recorded
the audio low intentionally...

39:07.790 --> 39:11.257
Because you needed her
to turn the volume all the way up.

39:13.717 --> 39:15.427
Listen, guys,

39:15.462 --> 39:18.908
...to the right, arms down.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.629
What are you doing!

39:22.664 --> 39:25.238
Susan? - The press thought
you were going in to help her,

39:25.273 --> 39:26.986
but you were going in to kill her.

39:27.549 --> 39:31.507
You only had a few seconds,
but it was all you needed.

39:52.211 --> 39:54.712
Somebody call the police!
She's been stabbed!

39:55.603 --> 39:57.655
Good work, Mr. Monk.

39:57.690 --> 39:59.740
And he did it
without a spectroscope.

39:59.775 --> 40:01.705
Could you stand up,
please, Mr. Terry.

40:01.740 --> 40:03.542
You're under arrest.

40:04.787 --> 40:06.234
It's one easy motion.

40:06.269 --> 40:08.498
Cuffs come out,
right arm down.

40:08.533 --> 40:09.762
Slap 'em on.

40:10.955 --> 40:12.761
You're goin' down, clown.

40:13.071 --> 40:14.984
Just like you're dancin'.

40:15.019 --> 40:17.020
- How was that?
- That was perfect.

40:17.055 --> 40:20.137
Now, don't be afraid to rough 'im up.
That's a bad guy.

40:48.752 --> 40:50.522
Hey!

40:50.916 --> 40:52.021
Marci.

40:53.063 --> 40:55.987
- What are you doin' here?
- I just came by to thank you.

40:56.022 --> 40:59.962
God, that was so crazy
of me to confess to murder.

41:03.679 --> 41:04.961
What time is it?

41:05.311 --> 41:07.770
- Midnight.
- Midnight.

41:08.226 --> 41:09.995
I'd invite you in, but, uh...

41:10.030 --> 41:12.129
I make you uncomfortable, don't I?

41:13.579 --> 41:15.123
That's okay.

41:16.179 --> 41:19.639
No. Listen, I'm sorry
about Brad and...

41:19.674 --> 41:22.522
Oh, I don't even like
Brad anymore.

41:22.557 --> 41:25.009
I'm never seeing
his show again. No way.

41:25.044 --> 41:28.748
Which is easy to say anyway,
'cause, you know, they canceled it.

41:28.839 --> 41:32.278
Well, okay.
Good for you. I'm happy for you.

41:33.581 --> 41:37.463
They told me how you solved
the case and everything, Adrian.

41:37.498 --> 41:39.921
I just think you're wonderful.

41:40.030 --> 41:41.783
No. Not-Not really.

41:41.818 --> 41:43.270
Yeah. Really.

41:43.305 --> 41:45.615
I started a whole
Web site about you.

41:45.650 --> 41:47.557
And a newsletter.

41:48.723 --> 41:49.927
Don't do that.

41:49.962 --> 41:52.670
Oh, you are the greatest
detective in the world.

41:52.780 --> 41:55.481
You are the greatest
detective in the universe.

41:56.016 --> 41:58.103
You should have
your own show!

41:58.138 --> 41:59.225
No. No, I'm...

41:59.260 --> 42:00.953
You should.

42:00.988 --> 42:03.348
You have to
promise me something.

42:03.383 --> 42:05.824
Will you promise me something?

42:07.091 --> 42:10.022
If you ever do
get your own show,

42:11.044 --> 42:13.037
you have to promise me...

42:13.072 --> 42:16.315
that you will never change
the theme song.

42:17.013 --> 42:18.696
Okay?

42:22.212 --> 42:23.391
I promise.

42:23.426 --> 42:25.085
That's the only thing.

42:25.120 --> 42:26.328
You promise?

42:26.363 --> 42:28.768
- Sure. I promise.
- You promise?

42:29.384 --> 42:31.230
Good night.
