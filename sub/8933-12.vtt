00:01.835 --> 00:02.168
This is th

00:02.168 --> 00:03.703
the
Evergreen forest.

00:03.703 --> 00:05.638
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:07.574 --> 00:10.477
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.477 --> 00:11.878
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.413 --> 00:15.181
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:16.149 --> 00:17.150
Yikes!

00:17.917 --> 00:19.619
Yaaaah...

00:22.288 --> 00:23.723
Yeaaaah!

00:23.723 --> 00:26.493
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:34.067 --> 00:36.136
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:37.871 --> 00:39.005
Cyril Sneer!

00:42.742 --> 00:45.178
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:45.879 --> 00:47.447
the Raccoons!!

00:47.447 --> 00:47.514
♪ (show theme music) ♪

01:02.695 --> 01:06.599
Luke's senses were sharper
than a new suit.

01:06.599 --> 01:10.103
The man with the wooden leg was
done for, and he knew it.

01:10.103 --> 01:14.407
He had stolen the stole...
but thanks to Luke,

01:14.407 --> 01:18.745
he was going to end up with a
different kind of wrap.

01:18.745 --> 01:20.013
Wow.

01:20.013 --> 01:22.782
What a private eye
that Luke Warm is.

01:22.782 --> 01:27.420
Compared to him, Sherlock Holmes
couldn't solve a math problem.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.722
Bert.. have
you seen the binoculars?

01:29.722 --> 01:31.324
We want to go bird watching.

01:31.324 --> 01:35.762
Aha. The case of the
missing spy glasses.

01:35.762 --> 01:41.101
This calls for
Bert Raccoon, private eye.

01:41.101 --> 01:45.638
Hmm. Uh-huh.

01:45.638 --> 01:49.309
Hmmmm. Ah-ha.

01:49.309 --> 01:51.111
Hmmmm...

01:52.112 --> 01:54.781
Hey. That's Cyril Sneer's limo...

01:54.781 --> 01:56.583
I wonder what it's
doing around here?

01:58.718 --> 01:59.986
Hmm.

01:59.986 --> 02:03.323
A couple of fast characters
doin' some fast food work

02:03.323 --> 02:06.192
outta their boss' fast car...

02:06.192 --> 02:09.295
Bert, may we have
the binoculars, please?

02:09.295 --> 02:12.565
Eh? Oh, sure...
As soon as I find them...

02:13.299 --> 02:18.104
Huh? Oh! Hah ha! You see,
I knew, I'd find 'em.

02:18.104 --> 02:20.607
Another case solved!

02:20.607 --> 02:22.108
Thanks, Bert.

02:22.108 --> 02:23.476
Ah it was nothing.

02:23.476 --> 02:27.347
Listen, if I were you,
I'd keep my eyes on these...

02:35.088 --> 02:36.322
Ready to go, Pop?

02:36.322 --> 02:38.791
What?! Oh yes I am.

02:38.791 --> 02:41.027
I didn't realize you
were coming with me

02:41.027 --> 02:43.029
to the annual
shareholders meeting.

02:43.029 --> 02:45.131
Shareholders meeting?

02:45.131 --> 02:48.601
We're supposed to be going to
the ball game together.

02:48.601 --> 02:51.604
Gee, Pop, you forgot again.

02:51.604 --> 02:54.307
That's the third
time this month.

02:54.307 --> 02:57.010
Well, why don't
you go with the pigs again?

03:01.981 --> 03:05.118
Heh! You must
be Cyril's boy?

03:05.118 --> 03:07.220
Uh huh. I'm Cedric.

03:07.220 --> 03:10.056
You're a Sneer,
no doubt about it.

03:10.056 --> 03:12.392
You've got the family nose.

03:12.392 --> 03:15.395
I should know...
I'm your uncle Simon.

03:15.395 --> 03:17.230
Uncle Simon?

03:17.230 --> 03:19.199
But..Pop?

03:19.199 --> 03:23.870
Simon?! My brother Simon
was lost at sea years ago.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.339
My baby brother. Cyril!!

03:27.307 --> 03:30.643
Ah, it's good to be home.

03:31.444 --> 03:33.213
Uncle Simon?!

03:38.751 --> 03:42.589
Heh, I clung to
an old chest for days

03:42.589 --> 03:45.592
before I was
finally swept ashore

03:45.592 --> 03:47.026
on a deserted island.

03:47.026 --> 03:49.696
Uh, I was stranded
there for years.

03:49.696 --> 03:51.764
Anybody can
come barging in here,

03:51.764 --> 03:53.199
claiming he's my brother.

03:53.199 --> 03:54.901
How can I recognize someone

03:54.901 --> 03:57.804
whom I last saw when
I was ten years old?

03:57.804 --> 04:01.341
Nine years, ten
months and three days old,

04:01.341 --> 04:02.542
to be exact.

04:02.542 --> 04:04.377
Anybody could know that.

04:04.377 --> 04:05.945
Well, I'll be.

04:05.945 --> 04:08.881
Remember carving
these notches, Cyril?

04:08.881 --> 04:11.251
To measure how tall
were both getting?

04:11.251 --> 04:13.519
Gee,
I never even noticed...

04:13.519 --> 04:16.656
Tell me, Cyril, do you
still have those miniature

04:16.656 --> 04:19.592
ships grandfather built us
for Christmas?

04:19.592 --> 04:22.729
Sure, uncle Simon,
they're up in his bedroom.

04:22.729 --> 04:23.896
Harumph!

04:23.896 --> 04:28.067
I built a ship myself
once... a real one! By hand.

04:28.067 --> 04:30.270
Took me fifteen years.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.372
Only way to get off that island.

04:32.372 --> 04:36.809
Gave me plenty of time to
think of coming home again.

04:36.809 --> 04:38.945
Well, we're
sure glad you made it.

04:38.945 --> 04:42.582
Gee, I've always
wanted an uncle.

04:42.582 --> 04:45.585
Do you like baseball?

04:45.585 --> 04:48.554
Haven't seen a game since

04:48.554 --> 04:51.624
Dad used to take Cyril and I...

04:51.624 --> 04:53.660
Would you like some company?

04:53.660 --> 04:56.963
Sure, Pop's gotta got
to a shareholders' meeting.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.531
Shareholders' meeting?

04:58.531 --> 05:00.733
I take it, Cyril,
that you've managed

05:00.733 --> 05:02.669
the family fortune well, then?

05:02.669 --> 05:04.771
Managed it!!
Why, I've turned it into

05:04.771 --> 05:07.907
one of the greatest
financial empires of all time.

05:07.907 --> 05:10.777
Sneer Enterprises is big.

05:10.777 --> 05:14.280
Bigger than your tall
tale about being my brother.

05:14.280 --> 05:18.618
Tsk tsk! Still have that
violent temper, I see, Cyril.

05:18.618 --> 05:20.620
We'd better
get going, uncle Simon.

05:20.620 --> 05:22.355
The game starts soon.

05:22.355 --> 05:24.657
Right.
Off we go then, Cedric.

05:24.657 --> 05:25.658
Bye, Pop.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.260
We'll be back for dinner.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.641
My brother. Hmpf!

05:41.641 --> 05:44.711
This guy's about as
genuine as a hen's tooth.

05:44.711 --> 05:46.979
I know what he's after!

05:46.979 --> 05:48.514
My money!!

05:48.514 --> 05:50.850
I may have a poor memory,

05:50.850 --> 05:53.486
but I'd never forget
my own brother,

05:53.486 --> 05:55.621
and he's not my brother!

06:00.393 --> 06:03.696
Oh look, Ralph,
the rare thrush woodpecker...

06:03.696 --> 06:07.233
Wow... and look at
what I've found, Melissa.

06:07.233 --> 06:09.569
I've never seen anything
like it before...

06:11.337 --> 06:12.772
Aaaaaah!!

06:14.006 --> 06:16.409
Oh Ralph! It's Bert.

06:16.409 --> 06:20.513
Hi guys. Doing
a little 'Bert'
watching?

06:21.647 --> 06:23.549
What were you doing
up in the trees, Bert?

06:23.549 --> 06:26.018
Looking
for clues, Schaeffer.

06:26.018 --> 06:31.257
I have a hunch, somebody's been
stealing apples from that tree...

06:31.257 --> 06:33.393
It's been picked clean.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.428
But that's
an elm tree, Bert.

06:35.428 --> 06:37.563
Hun? Well...

06:37.563 --> 06:39.499
Another case solved.

06:39.499 --> 06:43.269
Bert Raccoon, the greatest
detective since Luke Warm,

06:43.269 --> 06:45.171
does it again!

06:45.705 --> 06:49.175
We should plan to go
sailing sometime, Cedric.

06:49.175 --> 06:51.377
I can teach you
all there is to know...

06:51.377 --> 06:53.045
Oh look, uncle Simon.

06:53.045 --> 06:54.447
My friends.

06:54.447 --> 06:57.417
Hey gang.
Meet my uncle Simon.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.352
Huh? Uncle?

06:59.352 --> 07:01.521
Pleased to meet you all.

07:01.521 --> 07:04.223
Cedric has already told
me so much about you.

07:04.223 --> 07:07.627
He certainly is lucky
to have such good friends.

07:07.627 --> 07:09.128
How nice.

07:09.128 --> 07:11.464
Gee Cedric, I didn't'
know you had an uncle.

07:11.464 --> 07:12.865
Neither did I.

07:12.865 --> 07:16.302
Uncle Simon was shipwrecked
on a deserted island.

07:16.302 --> 07:18.204
for 15 years!

07:18.204 --> 07:22.108
He had to build a boat with his
bare hands to get back.

07:22.809 --> 07:25.778
Hmmm.. Interesting.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.648
Very interesting.

07:28.648 --> 07:31.083
We're just coming
home from the ball game.

07:31.083 --> 07:34.320
It was great going with
someone other than the Pigs.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.088
Well, come along, Cedric.

07:36.088 --> 07:39.325
I have a very important matter
to discuss with your father.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.595
Nice fellow.

07:42.595 --> 07:45.164
Hm, not
like Cyril at all.

07:45.164 --> 07:46.999
And a
good uncle to Cedric.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.969
Hmm. I don't know...

07:49.969 --> 07:53.105
Something about that
guy rubs me the wrong way.

07:53.105 --> 07:55.308
Oh, Bert. You've just
been reading too many

07:55.308 --> 07:56.843
of those detective novels.

08:02.448 --> 08:04.016
You know, Cyril,

08:04.016 --> 08:06.419
as a nice as it is
to be back home,

08:06.419 --> 08:09.956
I find myself
longing for the sea.

08:09.956 --> 08:13.125
I wish you were
there, too, believe me.

08:13.125 --> 08:15.161
I spent
so many years there...

08:15.161 --> 08:17.830
You know, I wouldn't
have had to return at all.

08:17.830 --> 08:20.366
if you had just
answered my letters.

08:20.366 --> 08:21.534
Letters?

08:21.534 --> 08:23.503
I don't remember any letters.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.172
You don't
remember most things, Pop.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.074
The letters
simply repeated,

08:28.074 --> 08:30.209
what father set
down in his will...

08:31.210 --> 08:33.779
That the family
fortune be shared equally

08:33.779 --> 08:35.581
between the two of us.

08:35.581 --> 08:39.886
Why with that, I could
build the boat of my dreams.

08:48.961 --> 08:50.696
How about this
for a headline, gang?

08:50.696 --> 08:55.167
Long lost Sneer returns
to claim family fortune.

08:55.167 --> 08:58.971
It certainly is an
unbelievable story, isn't it?

08:58.971 --> 09:02.074
Yeah, this case is hot.

09:02.074 --> 09:05.511
And I'm beginning to get warm,

09:05.511 --> 09:07.914
Luke Warm, P.I.!

09:10.716 --> 09:14.554
Pig 1: We've hit pay dirt
fellas. Simon's old trunk.

09:14.554 --> 09:18.791
Pig 2: Now we'll expose that
imposter for what he really is...

09:18.791 --> 09:21.027
Pig 3: Yah.. An imposter...

09:21.027 --> 09:23.896
And the boss will
give us that raise.

09:25.998 --> 09:27.233
Pig 3: Hey, who could that be?

09:33.739 --> 09:37.009
Well, just the bunch
of guys I'm looking for.

09:37.009 --> 09:40.079
The name's Warm, Luke Warm.

09:40.079 --> 09:41.814
Pig 1: Oh yeah? Well,
whatever you're selling,

09:41.814 --> 09:43.382
we're not buying.

09:43.382 --> 09:46.819
I'm looking for the
dirt on your new house guest.

09:46.819 --> 09:48.287
Get the picture?

09:48.287 --> 09:50.256
Pig 1: No, and
we don't have time.

09:50.256 --> 09:53.259
Look, you stooges
better start yapping',

09:53.259 --> 09:55.595
'cause I've got some
info that could land you

09:55.595 --> 09:59.332
in H2O at two hundred
and twelve, get it?

09:59.332 --> 10:01.300
Pig 3: We don't know,
what you're talking about.

10:01.300 --> 10:04.604
Have you considered English
as a first language?

10:04.604 --> 10:07.440
All right then,
get me the head honcho.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.611
I've the goods on
a pizza delivery scam

10:11.611 --> 10:13.846
he might want to know about,

10:13.846 --> 10:17.083
if you catch my drift.

10:17.083 --> 10:20.286
Pizza d-delivery
business...

10:20.286 --> 10:22.688
All I'm looking for
is a little hard evidence...

10:22.688 --> 10:27.159
like the kind I've
got on you, see?

10:27.159 --> 10:28.794
Oh no!!

10:28.794 --> 10:32.131
Pig 2: We can't let
the boss see that.

10:32.131 --> 10:33.933
Pig 1: W-what do you want?

10:36.102 --> 10:38.304
Aha. What do we have here?

10:38.304 --> 10:41.674
Pleasure doing
business with you.

10:41.674 --> 10:43.542
Where are
those hams hiding?

10:43.542 --> 10:46.646
Oh oh. The boss!!

10:48.347 --> 10:52.184
I've been expecting this
kind of underhanded chicanery.

10:52.184 --> 10:56.789
In fact, I've had a little quiz
prepared just for the occasion.

10:56.789 --> 10:59.925
It should prove exactly
who you are not!

11:00.926 --> 11:02.395
All set, Sir.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.997
Fasten
your seatbelt, Simon,

11:04.997 --> 11:07.133
you're in for a bumpy ride.

11:07.133 --> 11:10.870
Only my real brother could
answer any of these questions.

11:10.870 --> 11:12.238
Fire away.

11:12.238 --> 11:16.976
Pig 1: Um..uh.. What size
boots did you used to wear?

11:16.976 --> 11:18.811
Simple. Eight.

11:18.811 --> 11:21.380
Pig 2: Um.. He's right, Sir.

11:21.380 --> 11:23.816
He is? Well,
that's a stupid question.

11:23.816 --> 11:25.718
Anyone could have
guessed that right.

11:25.718 --> 11:26.886
Ask him another one.

11:26.886 --> 11:31.857
Pig 2: Um..okay, er..what
color were your old boots?

11:31.857 --> 11:34.226
Pig 3: No peaking.

11:34.226 --> 11:35.494
Green.

11:35.494 --> 11:36.962
Pig 1: Right again, Sir.

11:36.962 --> 11:38.831
What? A lucky guess.

11:38.831 --> 11:41.000
Give him a touch one this time.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.372
Pig 1: Ur..okay, did these
boots have any buckles?

11:46.372 --> 11:48.140
Is that all
you're going to ask him?!

11:48.140 --> 11:50.042
Questions about boots?

11:50.042 --> 11:51.210
Who cares?

11:51.210 --> 11:53.679
Didn't you find anything
else in that trunk?

11:53.679 --> 11:55.214
Anything at all?

11:55.214 --> 11:57.650
Pig 1: All we got
were his boots.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.552
And here's three more.

12:04.890 --> 12:08.427
Simon Sneer, Diary.. Hm!

12:08.427 --> 12:13.232
Last week, Sid
played a cruel trick on me.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.768
Hid a spider in my bed.

12:15.768 --> 12:18.370
He knows I hate spiders.

12:18.370 --> 12:20.840
Got my revenge today.

12:20.840 --> 12:24.043
I put a worm down his back.

12:24.043 --> 12:25.945
He was terrified.

12:25.945 --> 12:28.514
I laughed till it hurt.

12:28.514 --> 12:30.015
Hmm...

12:30.015 --> 12:33.018
Sounds to me like
there's an important clue

12:33.018 --> 12:34.787
in here somewhere, Broo.

12:36.355 --> 12:39.158
Hey, let's do
what Luke Warm would do.

12:39.158 --> 12:45.965

we're coming out ♪

12:45.965 --> 12:54.607

13:36.715 --> 13:40.152
There's a price to pay

13:41.987 --> 13:43.522
Oh hi, Bert.

13:43.522 --> 13:46.492
Uhh..oh.. hi, Cedric.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.761
Watcha been up to?

13:48.761 --> 13:50.596
Uncle Simon
and I have been doing

13:50.596 --> 13:52.164
all sorts of things.

13:52.164 --> 13:54.500
He's going to make
me a sailor, Bert.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.403
He's such a great guy.

13:57.403 --> 14:00.372
But, gee, Cedric,
what if by some chance,

14:00.372 --> 14:02.508
he isn't your uncle after all?

14:02.508 --> 14:05.211
There's something
suspicious about him...

14:05.211 --> 14:07.713
Coming here and spending
so much time with you,

14:07.713 --> 14:09.448
just out of the blue.

14:09.448 --> 14:11.150
Why is it so suspicious,

14:11.150 --> 14:13.452
that he'd want to
spend time with me?

14:13.452 --> 14:14.787
Why can't you just accept,

14:14.787 --> 14:16.355
that uncle Simon likes me

14:16.355 --> 14:18.691
and wants to spend time with me?

14:18.691 --> 14:22.828
Well. Maybe you're
just not getting the full picture.

14:22.828 --> 14:25.564
Picture! That's it!

14:27.366 --> 14:28.901
I just know that
there's something here

14:28.901 --> 14:30.336
that I've overlooked.

14:30.336 --> 14:33.839
All I need is a closer look.

14:35.674 --> 14:37.743
Hey, Melissaaaaaa!!

14:38.878 --> 14:40.012
Pop?

14:40.012 --> 14:41.213
What is it, Cedric?

14:41.213 --> 14:42.815
A letter for you.

14:42.815 --> 14:43.916
What's this?

14:43.916 --> 14:45.818
Legal notepaper?

14:45.818 --> 14:48.988
S. Moleman, lawyer...

14:48.988 --> 14:50.689
Simon Sneer.

14:50.689 --> 14:53.893
Hm! Proof positive
he's brother...

14:53.893 --> 14:55.761
Court order...

14:55.761 --> 14:57.596
Due tomorrow...

14:57.596 --> 14:59.965
I don't believe this...

14:59.965 --> 15:03.669
I have to turn over
half my fortune tomorrow?!

15:03.669 --> 15:06.238
Without as much as a fight?

15:06.238 --> 15:09.775
Gee, Pop,
it's not all your money.

15:09.775 --> 15:12.011
Not all mine?
Who's is it then?

15:12.011 --> 15:14.446
Well.. uncle Simon's.

15:14.446 --> 15:15.581
What's he need it for?

15:15.581 --> 15:18.884
So he can take you
away with him.. sailing?

15:23.088 --> 15:24.290
Here it is, Bert.

15:24.290 --> 15:26.025
I've enlarged the photograph.

15:26.025 --> 15:28.193
Ah, great, Melissa!

15:28.193 --> 15:31.297
Now, unless I've
missed my guess...

15:31.764 --> 15:33.966
Aha!! Look, Melissa.

15:33.966 --> 15:35.935
There's somebody gardening!

15:35.935 --> 15:37.202
See in the background?

15:37.202 --> 15:38.203
So?

15:38.203 --> 15:40.072
If we can
find out who he is,

15:40.072 --> 15:42.908
he could help us
identify Simon!

15:42.908 --> 15:47.112
And prevent Cedric from getting
hurt before it's too late!

15:53.285 --> 15:54.420
Bingo, Bert.

15:54.420 --> 15:56.288
Here's the information
you were looking for.

15:56.288 --> 16:00.826
The groundskeeper for Sneer
estates retired ten years ago,

16:00.826 --> 16:03.729
and is presently living
alone in the back hills.

16:03.729 --> 16:05.164
His name is Fern.

16:05.164 --> 16:06.165
Come on, Broo!

16:06.165 --> 16:08.667
We've got to find
Fern right away.

16:13.005 --> 16:14.974
Hi!

16:14.974 --> 16:18.310
Say, your name wouldn't
happen to be Fern, would it?

16:19.912 --> 16:22.314
You got it in one, sonny.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.616
Do you
remember Simon Sneer?

16:24.616 --> 16:27.987
I mean, could you recognize
him after all these years?

16:27.987 --> 16:29.922
Simon Sneer?!

16:29.922 --> 16:32.324
Heh..down at the Sneer estates?

16:32.324 --> 16:35.961
If there's one thing I
never forget, it's a face.

16:35.961 --> 16:38.063
Alright. Let's go, Fern.

16:38.063 --> 16:39.498
I need your help.

16:41.300 --> 16:42.868
How can
this be happening?

16:42.868 --> 16:46.472
I worked hard for
all of this. It's mine!

16:46.472 --> 16:49.174
And in just a few hours
I'll be giving it away

16:49.174 --> 16:51.443
like glasses at a gas station.

16:52.911 --> 16:55.214
Mr. Sneer...
Call me Simon.

16:55.214 --> 16:57.816
Simon, do you
find too hard to believe

16:57.816 --> 17:00.386
that in a few short moments
you'll be splitting up

17:00.386 --> 17:04.323
the biggest empire in the
history of the Evergreen forest?

17:04.323 --> 17:05.891
Mr. Moleman: My client and I

17:05.891 --> 17:07.626
have incontestable evidence

17:07.626 --> 17:10.229
of his relationship
to Cyril Sneer.

17:10.229 --> 17:12.698
There's nothing
unbelievable about it.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.901
This is the
worst day of my life.

17:15.901 --> 17:18.904
Remind me never to
have a brother again.

17:18.904 --> 17:23.008
Cedric, I hope this
won't be too hard on you.

17:23.008 --> 17:24.410
Not at all, Pop.

17:24.410 --> 17:26.678
I'm not losing something,

17:26.678 --> 17:29.048
I'm gaining... an uncle.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.816
Time to go in, Pop.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.021
Hi, uncle Simon.

17:36.021 --> 17:37.089
Don't call him that.

17:37.089 --> 17:39.892
Mr. Moleman: Mr, Sneer.
Sign here, please.

17:41.026 --> 17:43.195
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

17:43.195 --> 17:45.030
Not so fast, everybody!

17:45.030 --> 17:46.165
Huh?

17:46.165 --> 17:47.499
What's going on here?

17:47.499 --> 17:49.435
What's the meaning
of this intrusion?

17:49.435 --> 17:50.869
Bert Raccoon,

17:50.869 --> 17:53.605
ace detective to the rescue.

17:53.605 --> 17:55.207
Ralph/Melissa: Oh no.

17:55.207 --> 17:58.210
Bert, please!
We've all had enough of this.

17:58.210 --> 17:59.745
Hear me out, Cedric.

17:59.745 --> 18:02.781
I'm about to crack
this case wide open.

18:02.781 --> 18:07.252
I think my guest will
answer a lot of questions.

18:08.187 --> 18:10.255
Okay, you see anybody familiar?

18:10.255 --> 18:13.792
Oh my gosh! Yes!

18:13.792 --> 18:15.227
Huh? You do?

18:15.227 --> 18:16.895
(chuckles) Simon!

18:16.895 --> 18:18.931
It's been years.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.365
How are you?

18:20.365 --> 18:24.069
Oh Fern! That's not Simon!

18:24.069 --> 18:25.404
What?

18:25.404 --> 18:27.139
Have you lost your mind?

18:27.139 --> 18:30.809
Lost my line? When it's
twenty pound test line, boy,

18:30.809 --> 18:32.277
you never lose it.

18:32.277 --> 18:34.480
Mr. Moleman: Is there a point
to any of this, Mr. Bert?

18:34.480 --> 18:36.148
We're in the
midst of a very important

18:36.148 --> 18:38.150
business transaction here.

18:38.150 --> 18:39.318
Hold it.

18:39.318 --> 18:41.320
You might believe, you
thought of everything,

18:41.320 --> 18:45.757
but there's one small
bug in your plan, Simon.

18:45.757 --> 18:47.226
This one.

18:47.226 --> 18:49.394
It appears
to be a spider.

18:49.394 --> 18:50.562
Huh?

18:50.562 --> 18:53.599
I overcame my childish
fear of them years ago.

18:53.599 --> 18:55.634
Let's get this
business done with.

18:55.634 --> 18:58.237
Leave uncle
Simon alone, Bert.

18:58.237 --> 19:01.473
You're just fishing for
clues, that aren't there.

19:01.473 --> 19:03.742
What's that?
Fishing with shoes?

19:03.742 --> 19:05.611
Forget it!

19:05.611 --> 19:07.179
Use some of these.

19:07.179 --> 19:09.114
These are the best.
Worms!!!

19:09.114 --> 19:11.350
Keep 'em away from me!
Keep 'em away from me!

19:11.350 --> 19:12.618
Aahh!!

19:12.618 --> 19:13.819
He's afraid of worms...

19:13.819 --> 19:15.354
Afraid of worms!

19:15.354 --> 19:20.626
Hey! You must be.. Sid Leech?

19:20.626 --> 19:22.861
Sid! Who's Sid?

19:22.861 --> 19:25.797
I have here
some hard evidence,

19:25.797 --> 19:28.467
Simon's old diary.

19:28.467 --> 19:29.635
Listen!

19:29.635 --> 19:32.371
Sid played a cruel trick on me.

19:32.371 --> 19:35.107
Hid a spider in my bed.

19:35.107 --> 19:37.543
I got revenge today.

19:37.543 --> 19:40.779
Put a worm down his back.

19:40.779 --> 19:43.982
He was terrified. Ha!

19:43.982 --> 19:45.484
Simon's diary?

19:45.484 --> 19:47.052
Where did that come from?

19:47.052 --> 19:49.154
Beats us, Sir.

19:49.154 --> 19:51.056
I put it to
you, Mr. Leech,

19:51.056 --> 19:54.059
that as a boyhood friend
of Cyril's brother,

19:54.059 --> 19:56.161
you would know everything
there was to know

19:56.161 --> 19:58.163
about the Sneer family.

19:58.163 --> 19:59.364
Preposterous!

19:59.364 --> 20:02.467
So it's easy for
you to pose as Simon.

20:02.467 --> 20:04.703
Ha! Sheer fabrication.

20:04.703 --> 20:07.973
Sid. Ha. Of course.

20:07.973 --> 20:09.508
You weasel.

20:09.508 --> 20:12.844
You used to always
steal my candy.

20:12.844 --> 20:15.147
How could I possibly forget you?

20:15.147 --> 20:16.248
But..but...

20:16.248 --> 20:19.251
You mean,
you're not my uncle?

20:19.251 --> 20:22.154
Why would you do this to me?

20:22.154 --> 20:24.356
Mr. Moleman:
Mr. Simon, or Leech,

20:24.356 --> 20:25.757
or whatever your name is,

20:25.757 --> 20:27.326
under the circumstances,

20:27.326 --> 20:30.062
I can no longer
offer you my services.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.930
Here is my fee...

20:31.930 --> 20:33.832
Payable immediately.

20:33.832 --> 20:37.703
Undone.. by a worm.

20:45.344 --> 20:45.644
Cedric..I...

20:45.644 --> 20:45.711
Cedric..I..er...

20:45.711 --> 20:47.446
Cedric..I..er.. I know,

20:47.446 --> 20:50.515
I haven't been paying much
attention to you lately.

20:50.515 --> 20:52.017
That's alright, Pop.

20:52.017 --> 20:55.053
I know how much you
hate paying for anything.

20:55.053 --> 20:56.255
Heh heh...

20:56.255 --> 20:58.257
but if you'd care to join me,

20:58.257 --> 21:01.226
I'd love to take you
to the ball game.

21:01.226 --> 21:04.096
No Pigs?
No Pigs.

21:06.131 --> 21:08.567
Your detective
work was nothing short of

21:08.567 --> 21:10.135
remarkable, Bert.

21:10.135 --> 21:11.603
(chuckles) Naturally.

21:11.603 --> 21:14.206
One thing still
puzzles me though, Bert.

21:14.206 --> 21:16.108
What first made you suspicious?

21:16.108 --> 21:18.644
Well...
it was his handshake.

21:18.644 --> 21:21.880
He claimed to have
built a boat by hand,

21:21.880 --> 21:24.783
but he had soft hands.

21:24.783 --> 21:28.086
That kind of work would
give you plenty of calluses.

21:28.086 --> 21:30.589
And that's how you
deduced he was an imposter?

21:30.589 --> 21:33.625
Yep..an old childhood
friend of Simon's.

21:33.625 --> 21:36.728
In fact, he and Simon
went to school together.

21:36.728 --> 21:38.230
Oh, high school?

21:38.230 --> 21:41.233
Elementary, my dear Ralph.
