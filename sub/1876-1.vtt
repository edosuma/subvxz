00:29.947 --> 00:32.073
Oh, you're so good.

00:32.156 --> 00:35.410
Oh, yes.
I am the best, baby.

00:35.494 --> 00:37.829
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, that was a tit.

00:37.913 --> 00:40.332
That is a tit! Yes!

00:40.415 --> 00:42.334
Oh, you're so big!

00:42.417 --> 00:45.170
Oh, yeah.
That's right, baby.

00:45.254 --> 00:47.464
Doggie wants
to hide his bone.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.716
I'm bone smugglin', baby.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.844
Man, would you shut up!

00:51.927 --> 00:54.346
Hey, Jimmy.
Just wanted to say sweet dreams.

00:54.429 --> 00:56.348
Sweet dreams.
Good night, Mom.

00:56.431 --> 00:58.934
Kiss good night.

00:59.810 --> 01:03.021
- Something wrong with the reception?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:03.105 --> 01:05.691
There's this nature show
that I'm trying to watch.

01:05.774 --> 01:08.277
And the birds are
all scrambled and I can't even...

01:08.360 --> 01:10.612
Do me! Yes!

01:10.696 --> 01:12.698
Baby! Ride me like a pony!

01:12.781 --> 01:16.201
The thing must be broken
or I sat on the remote or something.

01:16.285 --> 01:18.704
- Getting ready for bed, son?
- I'm all set, Dad.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.874
No, I think he's tried
to watch some illegal channels.

01:22.207 --> 01:24.918
- lllegal channels?
- This is just bad reception, honey.

01:25.002 --> 01:27.004
- Spank my hairy ass!
- What's that?

01:27.087 --> 01:28.338
Oh, baby!

01:28.422 --> 01:30.883
You know what?
Just give me this, please...

01:30.966 --> 01:33.760
- Oh, my God!
- And let's get this...

01:33.844 --> 01:37.556
Okay, okay. What the hell's
the matter with this thing?

01:37.639 --> 01:38.974
Yes!

01:49.860 --> 01:51.945
lllegal channels? Shit!

01:52.029 --> 01:55.574
If there's any channel that should be
illegal, it's that all-woman's channel.

01:55.657 --> 01:59.411
Lifetime supply
of pantihose or some shit.

01:59.494 --> 02:02.789
Did you see The Little Mermaid
on TV the other night?

02:02.873 --> 02:06.710
- Ariel, man, she's so hot!
- She's a mermaid, dude.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.878
Yeah, Oz. But not when she's on land.

02:08.961 --> 02:12.758
Come on, Vicky, it's Stifler's party.
We got to go. It'll be great.

02:12.841 --> 02:17.679
All that happens at Stifler's parties
is people get drunk and do it.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.599
Come on, Kevin. Open it.

02:20.682 --> 02:23.936
It's a big, thick envelope,
Vicky. You got in.

02:24.019 --> 02:26.188
If you think so,
just open it.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.232
Fine.

02:35.197 --> 02:38.909
"Dear Miss Latham: We're sorry but
after keeping you on the waiting list...

02:38.992 --> 02:43.038
for the past couple of months, we've
decided that you are now rejected. "

02:43.121 --> 02:45.958
- Shut up!
- You got in.

02:46.041 --> 02:48.836
Yes! I love you!

02:59.054 --> 03:01.139
You think I should wear
this shirt to Stifler's party?

03:01.223 --> 03:03.767
You've worn that shirt for
three days in a row, man!

03:03.851 --> 03:05.853
Guys, she said it.

03:05.936 --> 03:08.313
- Said what?
- She said she loves me.

03:08.397 --> 03:10.691
Holy shit, dude! The "L" word?

03:10.774 --> 03:13.318
Cornell's not
that far from "U" of"M."

03:13.402 --> 03:16.905
It's only, like, seven hours.
And you get to drive across Canada.

03:16.989 --> 03:18.866
Beautiful country.

03:18.949 --> 03:21.869
Whatever. It's doable.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.496
What we should do today, in band...

03:24.580 --> 03:28.417
instead of playing our instruments
regularly, we should play backwards.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.878
- That'd be so funny!
- Yeah.

03:35.048 --> 03:39.511
You're talking about a post-high school
long-distance relationship.

03:39.595 --> 03:43.682
-And you and Kevin haven't even done it.
-That's not why we're going out.

03:43.765 --> 03:47.352
What do you expect him to drive
to Cornell for? Milk and cookies?

03:47.436 --> 03:49.605
We're gonna have sex
when he's ready and I'm ready.

03:49.688 --> 03:51.773
It's got to be
completely perfect.

03:51.857 --> 03:54.943
I want the right time,
the right moment, the right place...

03:55.360 --> 03:57.779
Vicky, it's not
a space shuttle launch. It's sex.

04:02.284 --> 04:04.786
- Finch.
- Here's the man we are looking for.

04:04.870 --> 04:06.330
- What's goin' on, buddy?
- Same ol'...

04:08.040 --> 04:11.168
Finch.
You got the Latin homework?

04:15.547 --> 04:18.091
It means, "My dog ate it. "
It's Latin.

04:18.175 --> 04:21.845
- It's a Latin joke.
- Latin. Just drink your coffee.

04:22.554 --> 04:25.224
- No, Jim, it's mochaccino.
- What?

04:25.307 --> 04:27.392
It's mochaccino.
It's not coffee.

04:27.476 --> 04:29.603
'Nova!

04:30.729 --> 04:33.857
- What's up, dude?
- Comin' to the party, you fuckface?

04:33.941 --> 04:36.318
Depends if my date
wants to stop by.

04:36.401 --> 04:39.571
- I'm workin' on somethin' new.
- I got an idea about something new.

04:39.655 --> 04:41.990
How about you guys
actually locate your dicks...

04:42.074 --> 04:44.910
remove the shrink-wrap
and fucking use them!

04:44.993 --> 04:48.747
Dude, it's gonna happen.
She's a college chick.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.250
Oh, right.
I'll see you guys tonight.

04:51.333 --> 04:55.003
I'll look for you
in the no-fucking section.

04:58.340 --> 05:02.302
I'm shooting for a 9:00 E.T.A.
Beer in hand by five after.

05:02.386 --> 05:04.596
Breath check.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.735
- I wish you wouldn't do that.
- You got something up your sleeve?

05:18.819 --> 05:21.613
This is a foolproof plan,
my friend.

05:21.697 --> 05:23.782
I have a serious question
to ask you guys.

05:23.866 --> 05:27.494
You know Nadia the Czechoslovakian
chick? She might be there tonight.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.788
Do you think she would prefer...

05:32.332 --> 05:34.918
laid-back Jim, or...

05:37.796 --> 05:38.922
cool, hip Jim?

05:39.339 --> 05:42.426
I don't think it really matters
with that shirt you're wearing.

05:43.260 --> 05:46.805
You're the one with the girlfriend,
and you're still stranded on third base.

05:46.889 --> 05:49.850
Hey, at least I know
what third base feels like.

05:49.933 --> 05:53.937
- You're still just a batboy.
- Batboy. What are you talking about?

05:55.147 --> 05:57.024
Guys, uh...

05:57.691 --> 06:00.360
What exactly does
third base feel like?

06:00.444 --> 06:02.529
You wanna
take this one?

06:03.572 --> 06:06.450
Like warm apple pie.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.120
Apple pie, huh?

06:11.413 --> 06:14.124
McDonald's or home-made?

06:14.208 --> 06:17.836
Gentlemen, destiny awaits.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.387
That's number five and six
for the Stif-meister!

06:32.351 --> 06:34.228
Holy!

06:35.270 --> 06:39.233
Nadia! Buenos dias.
Glad you could make it.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.401
I'll be back for you later.

06:47.658 --> 06:50.160
- Another party sultan!
- How ya doin'?

06:50.244 --> 06:52.496
Welcome to Stifler's
Palace of Love, fellas.

06:52.579 --> 06:55.541
The keg's back there! Enjoy!

06:55.624 --> 06:59.670
Vicky, Jessica! Great to see you.
Glad you could make it.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.547
Bitches!

07:01.630 --> 07:03.382
- Sherman!
- Hey!

07:03.465 --> 07:05.968
What the fuck
are you doin' here?

07:09.513 --> 07:11.014
Fellas! What's goin' on?

07:12.307 --> 07:15.686
Sherman. Not much.
Just scopin' the babes.

07:15.769 --> 07:19.731
Indeed!
Some fine ladies here, boys.

07:19.815 --> 07:22.943
Confidence is high.
Repeat. Confidence is high.

07:23.026 --> 07:25.445
Sherman is movin'
to DEFCON 2.

07:25.529 --> 07:28.866
Full strategic arsenal
ready for deployment.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.076
You have somethin'
goin' tonight, Sherman?

07:31.159 --> 07:33.245
You see that
Central chick, Bernette?

07:35.080 --> 07:38.375
She's around.
Seems she's taken a liking to me.

07:39.835 --> 07:43.172
It's time she experienced
the Shermanator.

07:43.255 --> 07:45.549
Yeah, okay, Sherman.
Whatever.

07:45.632 --> 07:49.678
I'm a sophisticated sex robot
sent back through time...

07:49.761 --> 07:53.265
to change the future
for one lucky lady.

07:53.348 --> 07:56.810
- Go get 'em, tiger.
- I'll be back!

07:58.979 --> 08:00.939
- Hopeless.
- Completely.

08:01.023 --> 08:03.066
- Hi.
- Hey, Vic.

08:03.150 --> 08:06.028
Oh, shit.
Guys... Guys...

08:06.111 --> 08:09.740
There's Nadia
and she just looked at me.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.451
- She just looked at me.
- Why don't you go talk to her?

08:16.163 --> 08:18.665
You're right, Kev.
I should just go talk to her.

08:20.751 --> 08:22.794
I could do that.
Sure.

09:06.463 --> 09:07.631
That's great!

09:22.229 --> 09:23.772
See ya later.

09:31.947 --> 09:33.490
We're here for the party.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.744
What party? There's no party.

09:42.082 --> 09:46.545
Weird.
Try the house down the street.

09:50.841 --> 09:53.385
So, what's your major?

09:53.468 --> 09:55.804
Post-modern feminist thought.

09:55.888 --> 09:58.974
Oh, cool.
Great night, isn't it?

09:59.057 --> 10:00.934
Sure.

10:02.311 --> 10:07.733
Yeah, it's just somethin' about the
springtime that's just cool, you know?

10:07.816 --> 10:11.195
Like the smell
of fresh rain or somethin'.

10:13.447 --> 10:17.159
- Suck me, beautiful.
- What did you just say?

10:17.242 --> 10:19.077
Suck me, beautiful.

10:21.914 --> 10:26.251
My friends call me "'Nova,"
as in Casanova.

10:26.335 --> 10:27.711
That's pathetic.

10:30.088 --> 10:32.216
Jeez, you don't
have to laugh at me.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.259
There's just some things
you need to learn.

10:34.343 --> 10:36.637
- Like what?
- Well, you've got to tone it down.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.931
You don't need to come
to a place like Lookout Point...

10:39.014 --> 10:41.934
and spout off cheeseball lines
to be romantic.

10:42.017 --> 10:45.521
- Okay.
- You have to pay attention to a girl.

10:45.604 --> 10:49.483
Be sensitive to her feelings.
Relationships are reciprocal.

10:49.566 --> 10:53.820
Come on, Casanova.
I'll take you back to your friends.

10:59.076 --> 11:03.288
Vicky, think it's time to take
the next step in our relationship?

11:03.372 --> 11:07.125
- Tonight?
- Yeah, it's such a perfect evening.

11:07.209 --> 11:09.628
I mean, it's how you've
always pictured it, isn't it?

11:09.711 --> 11:11.880
Damn, my farts fuckin' stink!

11:11.964 --> 11:16.468
Dude, you gotta take a shit!
You smell like a Yeti!

11:16.552 --> 11:18.095
Or not.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.931
Just relax.

11:25.519 --> 11:27.145
You actually said that?

11:28.981 --> 11:30.816
Shut up!

11:30.899 --> 11:32.985
You did a hell of a lot better
than I did with Nadia.

11:33.068 --> 11:36.029
Oh, thanks, Jim, that's great.
That's really reassuring.

11:36.113 --> 11:38.615
Hey, no problem, 'Nova.

11:38.699 --> 11:42.619
Hey, don't call me 'Nova any more.
I'm a fraud.

11:42.703 --> 11:45.122
You guys are pathetic.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.291
I'm gonna find myself
a little hottie.

11:48.167 --> 11:50.794
"Suck me, beautiful"!

11:56.842 --> 11:59.428
- Let me know.
- Okay.

11:59.511 --> 12:01.847
Keep going.

12:01.930 --> 12:04.433
I should be able
to talk to girls.

12:04.516 --> 12:06.852
I'm articulate.

12:06.935 --> 12:09.188
You know, I got a 720
on my S.A.T. verbal.

12:09.271 --> 12:11.481
Bullshit.
There's no way.

12:11.565 --> 12:15.444
I kid you not, man.
Look. Listen.

12:15.527 --> 12:17.696
Copious.

12:17.779 --> 12:19.740
Verisimilitude.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.076
Oh, now.

12:33.378 --> 12:35.380
Suck me, beautiful!

12:35.464 --> 12:38.258
- Damn it, Stifler.
- Checkout time!

12:38.342 --> 12:41.386
Please, vacate the room.

12:41.470 --> 12:43.597
You are such a jerk.

12:48.018 --> 12:51.230
God, I can't believe how many
cool people are at this party.

12:54.650 --> 12:56.944
And you got a keg too!

12:57.027 --> 12:59.863
- Wow!
- Indeed.

13:05.202 --> 13:08.080
Oh, wait.
I left my beer downstairs.

13:08.163 --> 13:10.499
No. No.
Here, babe!

13:12.543 --> 13:13.669
Thanks.

13:13.752 --> 13:17.005
You're really beautiful. Oh...

13:17.089 --> 13:20.342
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.985
You know what? I don't know
if I want to be doing this.

13:38.068 --> 13:39.903
Doing what?

13:39.987 --> 13:42.823
You know, if we hook up tonight...

13:42.906 --> 13:45.868
tomorrow I'll just be some girl
you go telling your friends about.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.204
No way!

13:49.288 --> 13:53.208
Steve, you could at least look at me
when you say that!

13:53.292 --> 13:54.334
Look.

13:55.627 --> 14:01.008
Sarah, I wouldn't go telling stories
or anything about you.

14:01.091 --> 14:05.679
I promise.
So, just relax.

14:05.762 --> 14:09.933
Take it slow,
and let the good times roll.

14:11.894 --> 14:15.647
- Okay.
- All right.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.406
What's wrong?

14:26.325 --> 14:28.619
What's wrong?
What is it?

14:31.413 --> 14:33.207
Xenophobic.

14:40.881 --> 14:43.383
- Regurgitation.
- I know that one.

14:44.426 --> 14:47.804
- Kevin likes it.
- He likes getting head.

14:47.888 --> 14:50.390
Gee, what a total shocker.
What about you, Vicky?

14:50.474 --> 14:52.643
I mean, have you just
never had one with Kevin...

14:52.726 --> 14:54.686
or have you never
had one, period?

14:54.770 --> 14:55.938
I've had one.

14:57.272 --> 14:59.441
- I think.
- Okay.

14:59.525 --> 15:03.320
That's a no. No wonder
you're not psyched about sex.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.364
You never even had one manually?

15:05.447 --> 15:08.700
-I've never tried it.
-You've never double-clicked your mouse?

15:10.869 --> 15:12.579
Nice!

15:12.663 --> 15:14.665
Jesus! How much did you drink?

15:14.748 --> 15:17.209
Hey, Stifler?

15:17.292 --> 15:20.212
- How's the pale ale?
- Fuck you!

15:23.590 --> 15:26.802
- That's Stifler's mom?
- Yup.

15:26.885 --> 15:31.723
Shit. I cannot believe a fine woman
like this produced a guy like Stifler.

15:32.182 --> 15:34.935
- Dude, that chick's a "MILF."
- What the hell is that?

15:35.811 --> 15:39.106
M-I-L-F... Mom I'd like to fuck.

15:39.189 --> 15:42.150
Yeah, dude!
Oh, yeah!

15:42.234 --> 15:45.279
- Yeah! MILF!
- Hey, guys.

15:45.362 --> 15:50.033
- Come here.
- Sherman, what's goin' on?

15:50.117 --> 15:53.162
Don't you think you fellas
could try a little tact?

15:53.245 --> 15:56.957
I got company,
if you know what I mean?

15:59.585 --> 16:02.087
She's hot!

16:04.673 --> 16:09.386
If Sherman has sex before I do,
I'm gonna be really pissed.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.725
The Shermanator?

16:16.185 --> 16:18.270
Come on, man.

16:19.605 --> 16:21.857
MILF! MILF!

16:21.940 --> 16:26.111
MILF! MILF! Hey, dude.
What are you doin' to her, dude?

16:27.112 --> 16:29.573
Oh, my God, bro, dude.

16:30.866 --> 16:34.495
Enough of this blow job bullshit.
I gotta get laid already.

16:34.578 --> 16:37.456
That's nice.
Really, really nice.

16:37.539 --> 16:40.792
- Can I have a ride?
- Sure.

16:40.876 --> 16:43.504
- Vicky, wait.
- Not for you.

16:44.588 --> 16:48.509
Yeti! I am the Yeti!

16:57.142 --> 17:00.479
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Finch, where were you last night?

17:00.562 --> 17:02.856
What happened to that
foolproof plan of yours?

17:02.940 --> 17:06.193
I was going for a fashionably late
entrance, and I was too late.

17:06.276 --> 17:08.945
So, no ladies left.

17:09.029 --> 17:11.573
It was a very
special night, very special.

17:12.907 --> 17:14.742
Guys. Guys.

17:17.329 --> 17:20.665
- I'll never forget this.
- I'll never forget it, either.

17:20.749 --> 17:22.626
Thank you.

17:33.846 --> 17:37.015
Fellas, say goodbye
to Chuck Sherman, the boy.

17:37.099 --> 17:39.810
I am now a man.

17:39.893 --> 17:42.563
I highly recommend
you join the club.

17:42.646 --> 17:45.983
We were doin' the wild thing
all night.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.026
I'm exhausted.

17:48.110 --> 17:51.113
I don't get it.
How the hell did you do that?

17:52.573 --> 17:55.909
It was just my time.
It was just my time.

17:57.494 --> 17:59.705
Best of luck to you boys.

18:02.332 --> 18:05.210
- I cannot believe this.
- Come on, guys.

18:05.294 --> 18:07.129
We should be happy
for Sherman.

18:10.299 --> 18:11.633
No, we shouldn't be.

18:11.717 --> 18:14.553
You know, I put in months
of quality time with Vicky.

18:14.636 --> 18:17.306
Sherman meets a chick
for one night and scores.

18:17.389 --> 18:20.058
- This is just wrong.
- No shit.

18:20.142 --> 18:23.645
How the hell am I supposed
to become Mr Sensitive Man?

18:23.729 --> 18:27.399
We're all gonna go to college
as virgins. You realize this, right?

18:27.482 --> 18:29.902
They probably have special dorms
for people like us.

18:29.985 --> 18:34.740
All right. I got an idea.
But it's got to stay between us.

18:34.823 --> 18:37.659
It's really simple. We just
got to make an agreement.

18:37.743 --> 18:39.745
It's more than an agreement.

18:39.828 --> 18:41.997
- A bet?
- A pact.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.333
No money involved.
More important than any bet.

18:44.416 --> 18:48.253
Here's the deal.
We all get laid before we graduate.

18:49.630 --> 18:52.841
Dude, it's not like I haven't
been trying to get laid.

18:52.925 --> 18:56.887
Think about when you work out, Oz.
You gotta have someone to spot you.

18:56.970 --> 19:00.849
Someone to keep you motivated.
That's what we can do for each other.

19:00.933 --> 19:03.602
We'll be there
to keep each other on track.

19:03.685 --> 19:06.104
Separately we are flawed
and vulnerable, but together...

19:06.188 --> 19:08.273
we are the masters
of our sexual destiny.

19:08.357 --> 19:12.277
Their tiger-style kung fu is strong,
but our dragon-style will defeat it.

19:12.361 --> 19:12.945
Guys!

19:13.028 --> 19:15.822
The Shaolin masters from
East and West must unite!

19:15.906 --> 19:18.450
- Fight, and find out who is number one.
- Guys!

19:18.534 --> 19:23.372
Come on. You're ruining my moment here.
This is our very manhood at stake.

19:23.455 --> 19:25.999
We must make a stand,
here and now.

19:27.334 --> 19:30.796
No longer will our penises
remain flaccid and unused!

19:30.879 --> 19:34.967
We will fight for every man out there
who isn't getting laid and should be.

19:35.050 --> 19:38.554
This is our day.
This is our time.

19:38.637 --> 19:42.933
And, by God, we will not stand by and
watch history condemn us into celibacy.

19:43.016 --> 19:45.060
- Amen.
- I like that.

19:45.143 --> 19:48.981
- We will make a stand. We will succeed.
- 'Bout time!

19:49.064 --> 19:51.650
We will get laid!

19:53.277 --> 19:54.862
The sex.

19:54.945 --> 19:57.239
It's got to be valid,
consensual sex.

19:57.322 --> 20:00.659
No prostitutes.
That's what you're thinkin', Finch.

20:00.742 --> 20:02.161
Busted.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.998
So, basically,
prom is our last chance.

20:06.081 --> 20:08.167
- Dude, prom sucks.
- I know.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.335
But you gotta think
about it this way.

20:10.419 --> 20:14.381
I mean, all the parties afterwards?
The chicks are going to want to do it.

20:14.464 --> 20:17.467
He's right. It's like
tradition or something.

20:17.551 --> 20:20.387
- Like the Rose Bowl.
- So, that gives us...

20:20.470 --> 20:22.764
Exactly three weeks to the day.

20:24.516 --> 20:27.186
- We're gonna do this.
- To the next step!

20:27.269 --> 20:28.228
Next step!

21:18.403 --> 21:21.114
Well, did you get the flowers?

21:49.768 --> 21:51.687
You'll get her back soon enough.

21:51.770 --> 21:54.022
- You think so?
- She likes you.

21:54.106 --> 21:55.315
- I like her too.
- Do you love her?

21:57.526 --> 22:00.362
You know what?
You can't really ask me that.

22:00.445 --> 22:03.365
If you want to get her in the sack,
just tell her you love her.

22:03.448 --> 22:06.368
- That's how I was duped.
- Look, Jessica.

22:06.451 --> 22:08.620
I don't want
to dupe her.

22:10.164 --> 22:14.293
All right. What you need to do
is learn how to press a girl's buttons.

22:14.376 --> 22:16.461
You have to give her
what she's never had.

22:16.545 --> 22:19.965
- What's that?
- Let me give you a hint.

22:24.136 --> 22:27.264
Comprende?
- You mean an orgasm.

22:27.347 --> 22:28.765
You got it, stud.

22:28.849 --> 22:31.810
Well, I'm pretty sure
that I've given her a...

22:31.894 --> 22:35.814
- No, you haven't.
- Well, there was one time...

22:35.898 --> 22:38.817
- No.
- Oh, man.

22:39.109 --> 22:43.363
Look, kid, it's up to you.
The big "L" or the big "O."

22:43.614 --> 22:46.742
Dickhead!
You gotta see this.

22:46.825 --> 22:50.913
Do you believe in magic
In a young girl's heart

22:50.996 --> 22:54.500
How the music can free her
whenever it starts

22:54.583 --> 22:59.004
And it's magic if the music is groovy
It makes you feel...

22:59.087 --> 23:01.590
What did you cocks do to him?

23:01.673 --> 23:04.468
I'll tell you about the magic
It'll free your soul

23:04.551 --> 23:08.889
But it's like tryin'to tell
a stranger 'bout rock 'n'roll

23:08.972 --> 23:11.141
Great.
See you next time.

23:15.938 --> 23:18.941
Hey, guys.
Came to watch me in action?

23:19.024 --> 23:21.693
- I think you sounded pretty good.
- Yeah, man.

23:21.777 --> 23:23.612
I think you need
your balls reattached.

23:23.695 --> 23:27.282
- Hey, keep it down, dude.
- What the fuck are you doing here?

23:27.366 --> 23:29.409
This place
is an untapped resource.

23:29.493 --> 23:33.288
I mean, check it out.
These vocal jazz girls are hot.

23:33.372 --> 23:36.124
Why the hell is he joining
jazz choir so late?

23:36.208 --> 23:39.962
Maybe he's preparing for
another senior year at East?

23:40.045 --> 23:42.714
You guys,
we don't even know him.

23:46.134 --> 23:47.970
You dipshit!

23:48.053 --> 23:52.182
You're expecting to score with some
goody-goody choirgirl priss?

23:52.266 --> 23:56.311
These chicks don't know me. I can work
the sensitive angle here, fellas!

23:56.395 --> 23:58.605
You know, it's just like
that college chick told me.

23:58.689 --> 24:01.733
All that you gotta do
is just ask 'em questions...

24:01.817 --> 24:03.777
and listen to what
they have to say and shit.

24:03.861 --> 24:08.198
I don't know, man.
That sounds like a lot of work!

24:11.577 --> 24:13.412
Just a second!

24:18.333 --> 24:20.752
Come in. Come in.

24:20.836 --> 24:23.130
Oh, Jim, you're here.

24:23.213 --> 24:26.592
I was just walking
by your room and...

24:26.675 --> 24:30.721
And, you know, I was thinking, "Boy,
it's been a long time since we've had...

24:30.804 --> 24:33.223
a little father-son chat. "

24:34.558 --> 24:38.687
Oh! I almost forgot.
I bought some magazines.

24:39.688 --> 24:41.982
Do you just want to flip
to the centre section?

24:44.193 --> 24:46.778
Well, this is the...
this is the female form.

24:46.862 --> 24:49.781
And they have
focused on the breasts...

24:49.865 --> 24:54.620
which are used primarily
to feed young infants...

24:54.703 --> 24:58.290
and also in foreplay.

24:58.373 --> 24:59.416
Right.

24:59.500 --> 25:02.794
This is...
This is Hustler.

25:02.878 --> 25:06.590
And this is a much
more exotic magazine.

25:06.673 --> 25:11.470
Now, they have decided to focus
more on the pubic region...

25:11.553 --> 25:15.390
- Right.
- The whole groin area.

25:15.474 --> 25:19.269
Look at the expression on her face.
You see that? See what's she's doing?

25:19.353 --> 25:22.731
She's kind of looking
right into your eyes saying...

25:22.814 --> 25:26.318
"Hey, big boy.
Hey, how ya doin'?"

25:26.401 --> 25:28.695
- You see?
- Right.

25:30.948 --> 25:34.326
Shaved is a magazine
I'm not too familiar with...

25:34.409 --> 25:39.081
but, again,
if you flip to the centre...

25:39.164 --> 25:41.166
section...

25:41.250 --> 25:45.796
Well, you see the detail that
they go into in this picture here.

25:45.879 --> 25:51.009
It almost looks like a tropical plant
or something, underwater thing.

25:51.093 --> 25:53.679
- Do you know what a clitoris is?
- Oh, my God.

25:53.762 --> 25:56.139
- Don't say, "Oh... "
- I know what a clitoris is.

25:56.223 --> 25:58.517
You've been there and back.
You know everything.

25:58.600 --> 26:03.230
I've learned about it in Sex Ed.
I don't need you to talk about clitoris.

26:03.313 --> 26:05.983
You know what?
I'm sorry, okay?

26:06.066 --> 26:09.486
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

26:09.570 --> 26:13.282
I shouldn't have got hot there.
You know what I'm going to do, Jim?

26:13.365 --> 26:15.826
I'm going to just
leave these books here...

26:15.909 --> 26:19.371
for you to peruse at your...
at your leisure.

26:20.247 --> 26:21.999
Wait!

26:27.296 --> 26:29.381
Well, safer than a tube sock.

26:31.800 --> 26:35.387
- Okay, that was good.
- Yeah.

26:37.347 --> 26:40.934
- See you at dinner.
- Yeah. I'll see you at dinner.

26:41.727 --> 26:43.687
So, Finch, this is your plan?

26:43.770 --> 26:47.149
You know, I don't think girls are
into the whole mini-golf thing.

26:47.232 --> 26:49.359
Kevin, I'm sure
that they're not.

26:49.443 --> 26:53.113
Actually, there is one small matter that
I need to ask for your cooperation in...

26:53.197 --> 26:56.200
- in the spirit of this pact.
- What do you need?

26:56.283 --> 26:59.411
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
And tell all the boys the same thing.

26:59.495 --> 27:03.373
Look, I gotta go.
Sixteen minutes round-trip.

27:03.457 --> 27:06.251
You know, Finch,
it's senior year.

27:06.335 --> 27:08.670
Don't you think it's time you learned
how to take a dump at school?

27:08.754 --> 27:12.090
When was the last time you looked
at the facilities in this school?

27:19.848 --> 27:23.310
Excuse me.
That's Paul Finch, right?

27:24.561 --> 27:26.688
You've seen him
in the locker room, right?

27:28.649 --> 27:31.818
My friends, they want
to know: Is it true?

27:31.902 --> 27:34.613
You know, that he's equipped.

27:34.696 --> 27:38.784
I have no idea. Finch showers
with his bathing suit on.

27:38.867 --> 27:41.286
I mean...

27:41.370 --> 27:44.623
As a matter of fact, it is true.
The guy's huge!

27:44.706 --> 27:47.876
- Does he have a date for the prom yet?
- No, definitely not.

27:47.960 --> 27:49.962
All right. Thanks.

27:51.338 --> 27:53.757
Oh, man!

27:54.216 --> 27:58.929
So I was thinking maybe you could give
me some advice, brother to brother.

27:59.012 --> 28:02.182
I thought you might know a trick
or somethin'to make her...

28:02.266 --> 28:03.308
Orgasm?

28:03.392 --> 28:06.228
- Yeah.
- What's good here?

28:06.311 --> 28:08.522
- Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
- What?

28:08.605 --> 28:10.023
How do you do that?

28:10.107 --> 28:12.401
Never mind that.
Pay attention.

28:12.484 --> 28:15.821
Is that all that you're interested in,
tryin' to get your girl into bed?

28:15.904 --> 28:19.074
It'd be good to be able to,
you know, return the favour.

28:19.158 --> 28:21.577
Be nice to know she enjoys
things as much as I do.

28:21.660 --> 28:24.913
Good. That's what I wanted to hear.
Now you qualify.

28:24.997 --> 28:28.750
- Qualify for what?
- You've just inherited the Bible.

28:31.962 --> 28:34.047
It originally started
as a sex manual...

28:34.131 --> 28:37.509
this book that some guys
brought back from Amsterdam.

28:37.593 --> 28:40.262
Each year it got passed on
to one East student who was worthy.

28:40.345 --> 28:44.474
Now, it's full of all sorts of stuff
that guys have added over the years.

28:46.894 --> 28:52.149
But you have to keep it a secret
and return it at the end of the year.

28:52.232 --> 28:55.152
So now you know. Good luck.

29:02.618 --> 29:04.870
- If you believe in magic
- Magic

29:04.953 --> 29:06.830
Don't you bother to choose

29:06.914 --> 29:10.083
If it's jug band music
or rhythm and blues

29:10.167 --> 29:13.504
Just go and listen
It will start with a smile

29:13.587 --> 29:17.508
That won't wipe off your face
no matter how hard you try

29:17.591 --> 29:20.469
Your feet start tappin'
And you can't seem to find

29:20.552 --> 29:22.971
How you got there

29:23.055 --> 29:25.724
Do you believe in magic

29:30.896 --> 29:33.232
Yeah, magic

29:33.315 --> 29:35.567
What was that?

29:35.651 --> 29:38.237
- Sorry.
- No, it was good.

29:40.656 --> 29:44.076
Well, it...
It came from the heart.

29:44.159 --> 29:48.163
Keep it coming.
All right, people, good work.

29:48.247 --> 29:53.418
Don't forget. The state competition's
a couple of weeks away, so keep on it.

30:04.012 --> 30:07.808
- Not bad, Chris.
- Really?

30:10.018 --> 30:12.437
Thanks.
Heather, right?

30:13.981 --> 30:16.942
You've got this sort of
Frank Sinatra thing going on.

30:17.025 --> 30:21.697
Right. I feel like I've discovered
this whole new side of me.

30:21.780 --> 30:24.324
I mean, music is so expressive.

30:25.367 --> 30:28.912
Okay, I agree, but aren't
you supposed to be out...

30:28.996 --> 30:32.749
trying to decapitate someone
with your lacrosse stick or something?

30:32.833 --> 30:36.795
Oh, sure, sure. You know,
I know what people think.

30:36.879 --> 30:40.507
It's like, "Oz, he's just this
kick-ass lacrosse player. "

30:40.591 --> 30:44.887
I also play football, by the way,
but that's not all that I am, you know?

30:44.970 --> 30:46.763
Of course, I didn't...

30:46.847 --> 30:51.310
It really bothers me when people
try to pigeonhole me like that.

30:51.393 --> 30:55.731
You? You think
I don't get that?

30:55.814 --> 30:59.151
God, it's like just because I don't
get drunk and barf every weekend...

30:59.234 --> 31:03.572
that people say, "Look, there's this
Goody Two-Shoes choirgirl priss. "

31:04.448 --> 31:07.951
Yeah. So, like,
what else do you do?

31:08.744 --> 31:11.455
Well, the same things you do...

31:11.538 --> 31:14.416
like hang out
with friends and stuff.

31:14.500 --> 31:16.835
Why? What do you think I do?

31:16.919 --> 31:21.298
I just realized that I don't know
anything about you. I was interested.

31:23.383 --> 31:25.219
What do you want to know?

31:25.302 --> 31:28.096
You know, stuff about you.

31:31.016 --> 31:33.060
All right.

31:34.811 --> 31:37.606
Mom, I'm home!

32:34.663 --> 32:36.331
Oh, yeah.

32:41.837 --> 32:44.173
It's not what it looks like.

32:50.512 --> 32:53.182
Well, we'll just tell
your mother that...

32:53.265 --> 32:55.267
that we ate it all.

33:35.307 --> 33:37.809
Goal by number eight,
Chris Ostreicher.

33:41.647 --> 33:43.774
- Nice game.
- Good game.

33:47.486 --> 33:50.447
Hey, what are
you doin' here?

33:50.531 --> 33:53.951
Just enjoying my first exhilarating
lacrosse experience.

33:54.034 --> 33:56.578
- You kicked butt.
- Oh, thanks.

33:56.662 --> 33:59.748
- Chris...
- You can call me Oz.

33:59.832 --> 34:02.209
- Do I have to?
- You can call me Ostreicher.

34:02.292 --> 34:04.336
- What's your middle name?
- Forget it.

34:04.419 --> 34:08.047
- I won't tell anyone.
- Well, neither will I.

34:11.760 --> 34:15.264
So, I had this thought and...

34:15.347 --> 34:17.683
It may seem like
it's way out of left field.

34:17.766 --> 34:19.768
I don't know if you can...

34:19.851 --> 34:22.271
but since I'm not going with
anybody, I thought that maybe...

34:22.353 --> 34:25.023
Those guys sucked ass!

34:25.107 --> 34:27.359
Choir chick, what the hell
are you doing here?

34:28.277 --> 34:32.239
Well, I was asking
Chris to prom.

34:32.322 --> 34:34.199
So, do you want to go?

34:34.283 --> 34:37.828
Oh, yeah!
That would be great.

34:38.704 --> 34:41.039
Just don't expect Oz
to pay for the limo!

34:41.123 --> 34:44.293
Stifler, fuck!
I mean...

34:45.335 --> 34:48.422
Why do you got to be
so insensitive all the time?

34:49.464 --> 34:51.132
What?

34:52.259 --> 34:55.637
Whatever. Look, don't forget.
My cottage after prom.

34:55.721 --> 34:58.223
On Lake Michigan.

34:59.266 --> 35:01.935
Wait up, you pussies!

35:03.312 --> 35:05.731
Well, I gotta hit
the showers now...

35:05.814 --> 35:09.568
but I think this is gonna
be really, really good.

35:09.651 --> 35:12.196
Yeah. Me too.

35:12.279 --> 35:13.655
All right.

35:21.246 --> 35:25.417
- Happenin' Oz!
- Working with the choir chick?

35:25.501 --> 35:29.087
What d'ya say, fellas? I just dig
those cute little sweaters she wears.

35:29.171 --> 35:31.882
Nuts you do, you little horn dog.

35:33.467 --> 35:36.011
Yeah!
Yeah, baby!

35:36.094 --> 35:38.597
Spank me!
Spank me!

35:38.680 --> 35:40.641
Hit that high "C"!

35:46.355 --> 35:47.689
What's goin' on?

35:52.945 --> 35:55.405
I was being selfish
and majorly insensitive.

35:55.489 --> 35:58.367
I'm a total idiot.
I mean, a fool, a buffoon.

35:58.450 --> 36:00.953
I think shithead
really says it.

36:01.036 --> 36:05.541
You're right. I'm a shithead,
and I want to make it up to you.

36:05.624 --> 36:08.210
Oh, yeah? How?

36:11.755 --> 36:14.424
Vicky, shh.
Your parents are downstairs.

36:14.508 --> 36:17.636
- Kevin, don't stop!
-Just a second.

36:31.733 --> 36:35.904
Hon, can you tell Vic
to come on down for supper?

36:35.988 --> 36:37.781
Holy shit!

36:37.865 --> 36:41.827
Shh. You know there's
no lock on your door?

36:48.750 --> 36:50.836
I'm coming!
I'm coming!

36:55.048 --> 36:56.717
- Oh, Jim!
- Dad.

36:56.800 --> 37:00.345
I was just looking at
the old family portrait out here.

37:00.429 --> 37:03.056
Well, that was
a fun day wasn't it?

37:03.140 --> 37:05.601
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

37:05.684 --> 37:08.604
Jim, I want to talk
about masturbation.

37:10.022 --> 37:14.276
I just want you to know that
it's a perfectly normal thing.

37:14.359 --> 37:16.528
And I have to admit,
you know...

37:16.612 --> 37:21.074
I did a fair bit of masturbating
when I was a little younger.

37:21.158 --> 37:25.287
I used to call it
"stroking the salami. "

37:25.370 --> 37:27.789
You know,
"pounding the ol' pud. "

37:30.542 --> 37:32.711
I never did it with baked goods.
But you know your Uncle Mort?

37:32.794 --> 37:35.214
He "pinched the one-eyed snake"
six times a day.

37:35.297 --> 37:39.510
See, it's like practise
for the big game.

37:39.593 --> 37:42.721
You see?
It's like... It's like...

37:42.804 --> 37:46.099
banging a tennis ball
against a brick wall.

37:46.183 --> 37:50.145
Which can be fun.
It can be fun, but it's not a game.

37:50.229 --> 37:52.606
- Right.
- It's not a game.

37:52.689 --> 37:56.151
What you want is you want
a partner to return the ball.

37:56.235 --> 37:59.738
- Do you want a partner?
- Yeah, I want a partner.

37:59.822 --> 38:01.740
- You do?
- I want a partner.

38:01.824 --> 38:05.869
Want a partner.
Good. Good.

38:08.747 --> 38:12.376
So, once Hal becomes king,
he has to take on...

38:12.459 --> 38:14.795
the responsibilities of leadership
and turn his back...

38:14.878 --> 38:17.381
on his old,
drunken friend, Falstaff.

38:17.464 --> 38:21.927
You see, Hal is going through a rite
of passage, much like you all are.

38:22.010 --> 38:26.431
So make most of the time you've got
left together. You'll miss it later.

38:26.515 --> 38:28.725
So, does your tongue cramp up?

38:28.809 --> 38:31.895
Nah. You get kind of dizzy, though.

38:31.979 --> 38:36.733
Wow. That's amazing. She's probably
gonna want to do it soon.

38:39.736 --> 38:41.989
All right. Class dismissed.

38:44.449 --> 38:48.203
Still questing after
the Holy Grail, huh, guys?

38:52.791 --> 38:57.171
- Hey, where's Finch?
- He went home to take a shit.

38:57.254 --> 39:01.550
I don't get it. How does a guy like that
get this sudden reputation?

39:01.633 --> 39:05.053
- What reputation?
- Observe.

39:05.137 --> 39:09.141
Excuse me.
Do you know who Paul Finch is?

39:09.224 --> 39:11.560
Yeah! He's the guy
with the tattoo, right?

39:12.644 --> 39:16.648
You know, the eagle and the
blazing fire and that stuff.

39:18.525 --> 39:22.321
If you guys see him later,
will you tell him Courtney says hi?

39:22.404 --> 39:23.447
Bye.

39:25.991 --> 39:28.827
Okay. Explain.

39:28.911 --> 39:31.872
I can't. I don't know
how he's doing it.

39:32.789 --> 39:35.209
I guess that just
leaves Jim trailing.

39:35.292 --> 39:37.753
-Jimbo!
- Better sack up, buddy!

39:37.836 --> 39:40.005
Yeah, I know.
I'm working on it.

39:40.088 --> 39:43.967
James? You are very good
in the world history class, yes?

39:44.051 --> 39:46.845
Me? Yes. No...

39:47.638 --> 39:49.223
Yes, I am.

39:49.306 --> 39:51.600
Perhaps you could help me
with my studies.

39:51.683 --> 39:55.938
Yeah. Absolutely.
That would be great sometime.

39:56.021 --> 40:00.567
- How about tomorrow?
- Well, I have ballet practise.

40:00.651 --> 40:03.821
Perhaps I could come
by your house afterwards?

40:03.904 --> 40:06.156
I could change clothes
at your place.

40:10.828 --> 40:13.664
Yeah. I suppose
that would be okay.

40:13.747 --> 40:15.624
Sure.

40:23.674 --> 40:26.093
Nice car!

40:26.176 --> 40:28.595
- I'm glad you think so.
- You don't like it?

40:28.679 --> 40:32.057
No, I like the car.
By the way, though, about prom?

40:32.140 --> 40:35.060
That was a bad idea.
I'm sorry I invited you.

40:35.143 --> 40:38.272
- What are you talkin' about?
- Please.

40:38.355 --> 40:41.775
I asked you because I thought
you might actually be worth going with.

40:41.859 --> 40:46.029
But you are just a jock.
No, wait. You're a jerk.

40:46.113 --> 40:48.699
Wait! I don't understand.

40:48.782 --> 40:52.411
I saw you making fun of me
with your lacrosse buddies.

40:52.494 --> 40:54.163
I wasn't makin' fun of you.

40:54.246 --> 40:56.832
Give me a break.
You're so full of it.

41:00.043 --> 41:05.132
Fuck me! There's gonna be an Eastern
European chick naked in your house.

41:05.215 --> 41:07.342
And you're not gonna
do anything about that?

41:07.426 --> 41:11.180
What am I gonna do, huh?
Broadcast her over the Internet?

41:11.263 --> 41:14.725
- Yeah.
- You can do that?

41:19.855 --> 41:22.274
No. I cannot do that to her.

41:22.357 --> 41:25.777
Jim, get some fuckin' balls.

41:25.861 --> 41:28.906
If you don't have the guts
to photograph a naked chick...

41:28.989 --> 41:30.657
how you gonna sleep with one?

41:30.741 --> 41:33.368
I don't like the kid,
but he's got a point.

41:33.452 --> 41:36.914
See, even Shit-break
knows you should do it.

41:36.997 --> 41:40.292
All you gotta do is set up some sort of
private link or whatever on the 'Net...

41:40.375 --> 41:42.377
and tell me the address.

41:42.461 --> 41:45.255
You can send me
the address too.

41:45.339 --> 41:48.467
I'll save you a seat.

41:48.550 --> 41:53.805
How sweet it is
to be loved by you, by you

41:53.889 --> 41:56.558
I needed the shelter
of someone's arms

41:56.642 --> 41:58.477
Someone's arms

41:58.560 --> 42:02.356
- There you were
- You were

42:02.439 --> 42:06.985
I needed someone
who understands my ups and downs

42:07.069 --> 42:09.071
There you were

42:09.154 --> 42:12.741
Okay, that was good,
but I want to thicken up that solo.

42:12.825 --> 42:15.828
Michigan State is this Saturday,
and I want that part to smoke.

42:15.911 --> 42:18.205
Yeah, I know,
my timing's off.

42:18.288 --> 42:21.959
It's not that. I think it'll work better
as a duet with a tenor part.

42:22.042 --> 42:24.002
I'll do it.

42:25.337 --> 42:27.965
- Dick.
- I'll do it.

42:28.048 --> 42:30.050
Great. See you tomorrow.

42:36.890 --> 42:40.060
- Why are you doing this?
- 'Cause I want to.

42:40.143 --> 42:43.522
Yeah? Well,
you can't fake this.

42:43.605 --> 42:45.691
You better practise.

42:57.953 --> 42:59.079
Come in.

43:00.789 --> 43:05.377
Jim? There's a...
a young lady here to see you.

43:05.460 --> 43:07.713
- Hey, Nadia.
- Hi, James. Ready to study?

43:07.796 --> 43:10.507
He's always ready to study.
He's a real bookworm.

43:10.591 --> 43:12.050
Dad.

43:12.134 --> 43:14.052
He's not one of those
nerdy guys...

43:14.136 --> 43:15.512
Dad!

43:15.596 --> 43:19.016
Well, I'll let you two
hit the books.

43:23.145 --> 43:26.190
You want a beer?

43:26.273 --> 43:30.068
- Oh, there we go.
- Come on, move!

43:30.152 --> 43:34.656
Steve! It's my computer,
and I wanna use it!

43:34.740 --> 43:36.241
Shut up!

43:36.325 --> 43:38.994
You need to change, right?

43:39.077 --> 43:42.206
- Uh, do you mind?
- No, not at all.

43:42.289 --> 43:45.667
Please, you know.
Just go ahead and get changed.

43:45.751 --> 43:49.129
I'll go downstairs
and start studying up.

43:51.757 --> 43:53.800
There he goes.

43:53.884 --> 43:55.177
Now we're in business.

43:58.472 --> 44:00.682
- Back in a sec.
-Jimmy, honey...

44:23.956 --> 44:25.290
Here she is.

44:27.000 --> 44:30.587
- Did I miss anything?
- No. You are just in time.

44:30.671 --> 44:34.091
- Oh. Oh!
- This is incredible.

44:34.174 --> 44:36.885
Oh, my God!
This is too much.

44:36.969 --> 44:39.972
Oh, did you see?
Oh, there that goes. Oh, Jeez.

44:40.472 --> 44:42.391
God bless the Internet.

44:44.685 --> 44:47.938
- Do it. Take it off.
- Oh, my God.

44:48.021 --> 44:50.732
Oh, thank you, God,
for this wonderful, wonderful day.

44:50.816 --> 44:53.360
She takes her vitamins.

44:57.489 --> 44:59.408
Stop hyperventilating.

45:04.454 --> 45:09.251
This is, like,
the coolest thing I've ever seen.

45:09.334 --> 45:10.961
I know.

45:12.588 --> 45:15.257
This is definitely one
of Stifler's best ideas ever.

45:16.842 --> 45:18.927
What is she...
She's touching my stuff.

45:19.011 --> 45:21.680
- Why is she touching my stuff?
- Let her touch.

45:21.763 --> 45:24.766
- She's going through my stuff!
- Nadia can touch anything she wants.

45:34.485 --> 45:36.945
- No, no.
- Nice collection there.

45:37.029 --> 45:39.698
She's gonna leave.
She's definitely gonna...

45:39.781 --> 45:42.409
She's getting comfortable.
She's not gonna leave.

45:42.493 --> 45:45.204
She reads the articles.
