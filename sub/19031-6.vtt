WEBVTT

00:00.765 --> 00:02.320
<i>(alarm beeps)
(lucy) I finally figured out</i>

00:02.320 --> 00:04.707
<i>The key to getting everything
done at medical school--</i>

00:04.707 --> 00:10.351
<i>Do a bunch of thgs at once and never sleep.
Hey, dad. Don't have a lot of time for our daily update,</i>

00:10.351 --> 00:13.691
But here goes--
school's hard, dorm's gross,

00:13.691 --> 00:16.686
Not really dating,
but I am having my lady needs

00:16.686 --> 00:19.072
Tended to
by a handsome young stallion.

00:19.072 --> 00:19.886
(laughs)

00:20.708 --> 00:22.281
Wow. Just remembered
who I'm talking to.

00:22.629 --> 00:24.884
Sorry, dad.
But since it's out there,

00:24.884 --> 00:26.703
Hot damn, I am in the middle

00:26.703 --> 00:29.727
Of a real sexual awakening
right now. Hmm?

00:30.254 --> 00:32.266
Yeah, that's about enough
for me today, too.

00:32.470 --> 00:33.163
Talk to you tomorrow.

00:34.239 --> 00:36.132
Baby, what's up? It's 5:30.

00:36.133 --> 00:38.515
I have 9,000 things to do.
Go back to sleep.

00:38.515 --> 00:40.862
Girl, once you wake up
the troops,

00:40.862 --> 00:42.660
You gotta storm the beach.

00:42.660 --> 00:46.008
You know what? You are
actually on my "to-do" list.

00:49.806 --> 00:51.024
Yeah.

00:52.117 --> 00:54.652
The iliohypogastric
and ilioinguinal nerves

00:54.653 --> 00:56.153
Innervate the groin region.

00:56.154 --> 00:57.756
God, I'm great at study-walking.

00:59.958 --> 01:01.251
Oh, good. Dr. Turk.

01:01.251 --> 01:03.615
I scanned those slides
for your lung lecture.

01:03.615 --> 01:05.278
I e-mailed them to you. Did you
get a chance to check 'em?

01:05.278 --> 01:08.629
He's gone, lucy.
He's gone.

01:08.629 --> 01:10.569
<i>Yesterday was
dr. Dorian's last day.</i>

01:10.569 --> 01:12.848
<i>Dr. Turk was taking it
pretty hard.</i>

01:20.510 --> 01:22.789
He done gone to zion.

01:24.852 --> 01:25.488
What?

01:26.940 --> 01:27.431
Hey, turk.

01:28.571 --> 01:30.113
Okay, this is
why pregnancy sucks.

01:30.113 --> 01:32.189
Your stupid name took my head
right to "turkey," because I

01:32.189 --> 01:34.551
Have been craving the hell out
of thanksgiving food all week.

01:34.551 --> 01:37.375
This morning I actually pounded
a jar of cranberry sauce

01:37.375 --> 01:38.236
And me dry stuffing.

01:38.236 --> 01:42.398
It was like a holiday, only much, much sadder.
You want to talk about sad--

01:42.398 --> 01:45.489
I spent the whole morning moping
around 'cause j.D. Wasn't here.

01:45.489 --> 01:49.345
It took me about an hour to get out of it.
Oh, he said to say he misses you.

01:50.774 --> 01:51.245
He did?

01:51.245 --> 01:51.696
Yeah.

01:53.963 --> 01:56.798
(exhales deeply)

01:56.799 --> 01:58.333
It's okay. It's okay.

01:58.334 --> 02:01.003
He reacted the same way
when he got your muffin basket.

02:01.004 --> 02:03.416
Look, turk, I know that you're
hurting, but you're gonna find

02:03.416 --> 02:04.883
Someone else here
to ride the eagle with.

02:04.883 --> 02:07.526
Elliot, you don't
ride the eagle. You eagle.

02:07.526 --> 02:10.679
<i>You choose "toe or thumb?" you
join "fight club with pillows."</i>

02:10.679 --> 02:13.980
You and j.D. Had a pillow fight club?
The first rule of pillow fight club--you don't talk--

02:13.980 --> 02:15.550
Yeah, I get it.
No, I don't think you do. Elliot.

02:15.550 --> 02:17.994
Elliot, please don't say anything.
Hey, turkleton.

02:18.785 --> 02:20.322
I know what it's like
to lose a friend.

02:20.571 --> 02:22.539
I lost my good buddy steve
back in korea.

02:22.924 --> 02:26.633
Sir, that was a horrible war.
Yes, it was, but I'm talking about

02:26.633 --> 02:28.934
A family trip we tookto the '88.

02:28.934 --> 02:31.433
I suggested a wife swap
to steve,

02:31.433 --> 02:33.675
And things got pretty weird.

02:33.675 --> 02:36.238
Yes, it was an amazing night,

02:36.238 --> 02:39.551
But was it worth it
to lose a good friend over?

02:40.166 --> 02:40.943
Probably.

02:44.708 --> 02:46.175
Great effort in the sack
last night.

02:46.175 --> 02:48.702
Just remember, when I say,
"I hate you. Don't touch me,"

02:48.702 --> 02:50.734
It's not about you.
It's about all men.

02:50.734 --> 02:52.909
Cool. Crap, I'm a
be late for class.

02:52.909 --> 02:54.925
Drew, wait. There's something
I have to tell you--

02:56.452 --> 02:57.239
I'm late, too.

02:58.878 --> 02:59.771
You missed your...

02:59.771 --> 03:00.359
Yeah.

03:02.882 --> 03:03.712
Oh, my god.

03:05.268 --> 03:05.780
(laughs)

03:06.046 --> 03:08.810
I'm kidding. Your face
looks so dumb right now.

03:08.810 --> 03:11.032
Why would you do that to me?
I'm bored.

03:11.032 --> 03:13.336
You're lucky
I vibe on crazy.

03:13.336 --> 03:17.471
I hate you. Don't touch me.
Fair enough.

03:19.771 --> 03:22.236
At patients
with pancreatic disorders.

03:22.236 --> 03:22.937
Shh.

03:24.150 --> 03:25.839
Hey, drew.
Glad you could make it.

03:26.924 --> 03:30.247
Sorry I'm late.
You should be sorry as I'm giving all of you murderers

03:30.247 --> 03:33.397
The honor of shadowing me today.
There is no penalty forthcoming,

03:33.397 --> 03:35.365
However, as it is
an optional exercise.

03:35.365 --> 03:38.269
Optional?
Hey, man, I gotta cruise.

03:38.269 --> 03:39.806
Bunch of crap to do.
You--you cool here?

03:39.806 --> 03:41.833
Now just a second.
You're leaving?

03:42.640 --> 03:43.876
Well, what the heck
am I supposed to do?

03:43.876 --> 03:46.209
How will the hospital get by,
for god sake?

03:46.209 --> 03:48.084
(mutters) shut it down.
(electricity powers down)

03:48.084 --> 03:50.869
Everyone, shut it down. It's over.
(machine beeping erratically)

03:50.869 --> 03:55.220
Stop saving lives.
(laughs) man, you crack me up.

03:55.220 --> 03:56.416
Ugh.
(electricity powers up)

03:57.259 --> 03:58.671
Uh, but for reals,
I tta split.

03:58.671 --> 03:59.824
I met this old cat upstairs

03:59.824 --> 04:01.855
Who's got really painful glaucoma.

04:01.855 --> 04:05.357
(singsongy) translation--
crazy-ass government product.

04:06.106 --> 04:06.970
(normal voice) yeah,
we'll probably hang out,

04:06.970 --> 04:08.541
Maybe watch
some "benson" reruns.

04:08.541 --> 04:11.451
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, you know what I'm saying.

04:13.596 --> 04:16.916
Number one, remind me again
why I can't kill him.

04:16.916 --> 04:19.144
His daddy built the hospital.
Fair enough.

04:19.916 --> 04:21.338
All of you remain where you are
for a moment.

04:21.969 --> 04:23.189
I'm going to punch through
a wall.

04:23.189 --> 04:25.648
(thud)

04:26.193 --> 04:27.521
Maureen, I e-mailed you

04:27.521 --> 04:29.211
Your bachelorette pictures
this morning.

04:29.211 --> 04:30.922
I would have put them
in the regular mail,

04:30.922 --> 04:32.640
But I think we could
get arrested.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.898
Okay, class,
I want to thank ms. Bennett

04:34.898 --> 04:37.707
For her help on this presentation.
Thank you!

04:37.707 --> 04:41.596
Not really a stand-and-wave
moment. Here we go.

04:41.596 --> 04:43.510
What do you mean they're not
the bachelorette photos?

04:43.510 --> 04:44.874
All right, people, we'll start

04:44.874 --> 04:48.122
With advanced mesothelioma of the lung.
(click)

04:48.122 --> 04:49.776
(students laugh)

04:51.266 --> 04:53.234
Now that's not a lung.
Dr. Turk, please--

04:53.234 --> 04:57.043
No, lucy, I think this could be
what we call a teachable moment.

04:57.043 --> 04:58.658
Next up should be

04:59.264 --> 05:00.438
Pulmonary fibrosis.

05:00.438 --> 05:01.862
(students laugh)

05:02.741 --> 05:04.130
That ain't pulmonary fibrosis.

05:04.130 --> 05:05.794
That's a woman nibbling
on some panties.

05:06.672 --> 05:10.597
(click)
looks like the night took
a dark turn, people.

05:10.597 --> 05:13.264
Let's see what's next.
Oh, she's back!

05:13.264 --> 05:14.898
Back in action!
(click)

05:14.898 --> 05:16.585
Oh!
(man) ooh.

05:17.566 --> 05:19.976
You can't do stuff like that
to strangers, woman.

05:19.976 --> 05:22.041
It's not right.
Know. I'm sorry.

05:22.041 --> 05:23.812
He's a human being, lucy.

05:23.812 --> 05:28.059
He got 9 bucks, okay?
I made it rain. Move on.

05:31.937 --> 05:43.893
Sync by ReHelen
www.addic7ed.com

05:48.178 --> 05:48.639
You all right?

05:48.639 --> 05:52.255
It was a rough surgerydon't
think the guy's gonna make it.

05:52.255 --> 05:53.925
Oh, that stinks.

05:53.925 --> 05:56.377
Yeah. This is
when I really miss j.D.

05:56.377 --> 05:59.549
You know, at work,
he'd see me like this

05:59.549 --> 06:00.796
And then try and pick me up.

06:00.796 --> 06:03.209
Then I'd point to that doctor
over there and I'd say,

06:03.209 --> 06:07.234
"who does that look like
to you?" and he'd say...
Who?

06:07.234 --> 06:09.934
A japanese laura dern.
How do you not see that?

06:10.758 --> 06:12.178
I can't believe
you get to see j.D. Naked.

06:13.015 --> 06:14.840
That was weird.

06:14.840 --> 06:17.361
That's okay.
That's okay, turk.

06:18.320 --> 06:21.442
I can do this with you.
See that nurse over there?

06:21.442 --> 06:23.307
She looks like
a mexican carrie scott.

06:23.307 --> 06:24.369
Who?

06:24.369 --> 06:25.991
Childhood friend.

06:25.991 --> 06:28.951
Yeah, she, uh, joined a cult
and disappeared when she was 16.

06:28.951 --> 06:32.151
Oh, my god. That could actually
be her if she got really tan.

06:32.151 --> 06:34.827
Carrie! Carrie scott!

06:34.827 --> 06:36.332
No, not her.

06:36.332 --> 06:37.935
Police are right.
She's probably dead.

06:37.935 --> 06:40.008
What were we talking about?
I don't remember.

06:41.170 --> 06:43.171
<i>This morning was
such a disaster.</i>

06:43.172 --> 06:46.174
<i>Maybe my problem is that I've
been trying to do too much.</i>

06:46.175 --> 06:48.977
<i>Mm, I decided to do some
optional shadowing of dr. Cox</i>

06:48.978 --> 06:52.013
<i>To get my mind off it.
Dr. Cox, may I ask you a question?</i>

06:52.014 --> 06:54.349
Do you see that shadow?

06:54.350 --> 06:56.770
Over there? Do you see how
it's just quietly standing

06:56.770 --> 06:58.894
Against the wall,
not askingnane questions

06:59.000 --> 07:01.600
That make me crave the sweet
taste  a hollow-point bullet?

07:02.227 --> 07:04.765
That's you--
a dumb, quiet shadow.

07:05.970 --> 07:08.772
Act like it.
You know why you should ignore him?

07:08.773 --> 07:09.579
Let's just forget for a second

07:09.579 --> 07:13.368
That you sprained your wrist punching a wall.
Oh, I can explain that. I hate someone.

07:13.795 --> 07:15.318
Miss simmo' platelets
are low,

07:15.318 --> 07:19.805
<i>So I don't really think heparin's a good idea.
I'd never met dr. Reid, but she seemed incredible.</i>

07:20.104 --> 07:22.132
<i>She went toe-to-toe
with dr. Cox.</i>

07:22.132 --> 07:24.679
But the bottom line is--
I admitted her, so she's mine.

07:24.679 --> 07:26.430
Fair enough. She's yours.

07:26.430 --> 07:29.358
Thank you. Hmm.

07:29.393 --> 07:31.447
<i>She was amazing
with her patients...</i>

07:31.448 --> 07:34.450
You're gonna be just fine, kate.
We'll get the blood work back

07:34.451 --> 07:36.319
And then run a simple test
called a bronchoscopy.

07:36.320 --> 07:38.254
<i>She was a loving wife...</i>

07:38.255 --> 07:40.089
J.D., what's wrong?

07:40.090 --> 07:43.559
Yes, sweetie,
turk misses you, too.

07:43.560 --> 07:44.861
What?

07:44.862 --> 07:47.296
I don't--he's wearing scru.

07:47.297 --> 07:48.965
His green ones.

07:48.966 --> 07:51.534
<i>And she did it all
while being pregnant.</i>

07:51.535 --> 07:54.003
Can you hand me that bedpan?
Thank you.

07:54.004 --> 07:55.738
(vomits and coughs)

07:55.739 --> 07:59.275
Oh, yeah. Much better.
Take that. Who are you

07:59.276 --> 08:01.144
And why are you following me
around and staring at me?

08:01.145 --> 08:04.647
<i>I'm lucy. I'm a med student.
Be cool, lucy. Be cool.</i>

08:04.648 --> 08:07.917
And I just have to say, you have
the spirit of a noble warrior,

08:07.918 --> 08:10.720
Which is not to say that
you're not incredibly feminine,

08:10.721 --> 08:12.221
Because clearly you are.

08:12.222 --> 08:14.891
I mean, you're, like,
stupid, frickin' pregnant,

08:14.892 --> 08:16.392
But also so skinny.

08:16.393 --> 08:20.129
I mean, come on. You're like
a snake that ate a tiny horse.

08:20.130 --> 08:23.966
(laughs) my point is, I'd like
to get to know you better.

08:23.967 --> 08:26.769
Oh, so you're crazy.
Oh, yeah.

08:26.770 --> 08:28.668
Oh, that's cool. I'm
dr. Elliot reid. See you later.

08:28.843 --> 08:31.378
Who's got food? Mama needs
a refill! I'm dying here!

08:31.714 --> 08:34.849
All right, class, we're looking for evidence
Of disease or abnormality.

08:34.849 --> 08:37.791
Hey, dr. T. I heard one time
they opened up a dude's stomach,

08:37.791 --> 08:39.193
And there was a finger
inside of it.

08:39.193 --> 08:40.595
I mean, think about it.
You're in a lab,

08:40.595 --> 08:42.280
You're a little buzzed,
everything's cool.

08:42.280 --> 08:44.405
Then all of a sudden your
dead guy's flipping you the bird

08:44.405 --> 08:46.533
With another dude's finger.
I mean, what?!

08:48.316 --> 08:50.116
Denise, could you please handle
this? I've had a really bad day.

08:50.916 --> 08:51.503
I'd love to.

08:52.661 --> 08:54.766
So... You and me?

08:55.653 --> 08:57.057
We're gonna have
a stupid jar.

08:57.582 --> 08:59.301
Every time you say
something stupid,

08:59.336 --> 09:01.138
We're gonna put a nickel
in that jar.

09:01.138 --> 09:03.180
And when that jar
gets nice and full,

09:03.180 --> 09:05.665
We're gonna take it
and beat you with it.

09:06.135 --> 09:06.853
Okay?

09:07.643 --> 09:08.538
Dude.

09:09.267 --> 09:10.702
<i>How much fun is she
in the sack?</i>

09:10.702 --> 09:12.330
More scary than fun.

09:12.330 --> 09:14.249
Look cole, you gotta
dial it down a bit.

09:14.249 --> 09:15.758
School newspaper's
coming out next week,

09:15.758 --> 09:18.267
And they're publishing class rankings.
I thought you were already number one.

09:18.267 --> 09:21.078
That's just with dr. Cox.
These are the real rankings.

09:21.078 --> 09:24.018
Everything counts--grades,
participation, grunt work.

09:24.018 --> 09:25.272
Everyone sees.
Really?

09:25.272 --> 09:30.126
Yeah.
Huh. Hey, it's all good. I don't
mind if people know my rank.

09:30.126 --> 09:31.837
Okay, it's like
going to the gym.

09:31.837 --> 09:34.352
When you blast it as hard as
I do, you want people to notice.

09:34.352 --> 09:36.194
How much you think I bench?
I don't know, like--

09:36.194 --> 09:39.227
I don't bench. I do high intensity reps.
I'm toned as bal.

09:39.892 --> 09:41.378
What's with the lame writing on your ass?

09:41.378 --> 09:42.888
Is it like a surgeon thing?

09:42.888 --> 09:46.294
No, it's for pork chop day,
an old tradition for me and j.D.

09:46.329 --> 09:47.618
We made special pants.

09:47.618 --> 09:49.227
His said "pork" on the back.

09:49.633 --> 09:52.745
That's actually why he had that
little sexual harassment thingy.

09:53.366 --> 09:56.337
There's only one left. Do you mind?
No, that's all you. I don't even like pork chops.

09:56.337 --> 09:59.590
Hey, look. There's j.D.
Where? Where? Did he wear his pants?

10:00.153 --> 10:02.072
Sucka. I lied. I love 'em.

10:04.465 --> 10:06.135
You're a pork chop keyser soze.

10:07.569 --> 10:10.159
Can you believe that?
Oh, I do. The chops are awesome.

10:10.159 --> 10:12.722
I pounded down 11 of 'em
already, gristle and all.

10:12.722 --> 10:15.828
And I'm a vegetarian,
but the baby--carnivore.

10:16.359 --> 10:16.866
Hey, turk.

10:18.307 --> 10:20.711
(sniffs) mmm,
it's like christmas morning.

10:22.596 --> 10:24.631
You want to help me get
her back? This is what we do--

10:24.631 --> 10:26.711
We fill her car up with
pork chops, and when she opens

10:26.711 --> 10:29.083
The door, the pork chops
will slide all over the place,

10:29.083 --> 10:30.410
And she'll have to dig
a little seat.

10:30.937 --> 10:34.348
I'm talking about a major inconvenience.
Okay, you're losing it.

10:34.348 --> 10:36.060
We need to get you
a new work buddy, like, today.

10:36.060 --> 10:39.216
Until then, you gotta
just chillax, my brother.

10:40.360 --> 10:42.809
Okay, I cannot pull off "my brother," can I?
No.

10:42.809 --> 10:46.183
At least I nailed "chillax."
No, you didn't.

10:46.995 --> 10:49.264
Dr. Reid, you're so inspiring.
Oh, stop.

10:50.060 --> 10:50.725
Go on.

10:50.925 --> 10:52.556
You're totally
the kind of doctor I want to be

10:52.591 --> 10:56.666
When I get super old.
Compliment took a bit of a left turn there.

10:57.160 --> 10:59.605
I just don't think you realize
how awesome it is

10:59.605 --> 11:01.613
For me to see a woman
actually doing it, you know?

11:01.769 --> 11:03.047
I just don't think you realize
you're a great doctor,

11:03.047 --> 11:05.465
<i>And you've got your life
together. You're handling both.</i>

11:05.465 --> 11:07.834
Me--I've got nine texts
this minute.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.825
My boyfriend needs me, my dad
wants his daily phone call,

11:10.825 --> 11:12.021
My sister maureen is

11:12.021 --> 11:13.656
Freaking out about
her bachelorette party.

11:13.656 --> 11:15.662
She has to have sex with
her fiancÃ© for the first time

11:15.662 --> 11:18.466
In case the stripper got her
pregnant--long story.
Oh, sure, sure.

11:18.466 --> 11:21.674
Plus, with all the studying and the schoolwork and--
lucy, you can do it.

11:21.674 --> 11:23.140
You just need to learn
how to prioritize.

11:24.804 --> 11:26.863
Uh-oh. (voice breaks)
I've been so emotional lately,

11:26.863 --> 11:29.360
And I just pictured you
as my little sister,

11:29.360 --> 11:31.713
And I'm starting...
To lose it.

11:31.713 --> 11:33.342
Quick. Say something to remind
me of how crazy you are.

11:33.342 --> 11:35.709
Um... I ran out of underwear
today,

11:35.709 --> 11:39.190
So I wore my bathing suit.
Huh. Thanks. All better.

11:41.448 --> 11:43.907
Hey, so you and me got off
on the wrong foot.

11:43.907 --> 11:46.924
Nobody's fault. I mean, you put
two alpha dogs in a cage,

11:46.924 --> 11:49.437
And there's bound  be
some barking, right? Woof! Woof!

11:49.437 --> 11:52.657
Yes. Yes, we are
exactly alike indeed.

11:52.657 --> 11:56.004
See, you get it. Anyway, I just
wanted to talk about my ranking

11:56.004 --> 11:57.351
Before the newsletter
comes out.

11:57.351 --> 11:59.371
Spoiler alert--
you're last.

11:59.371 --> 12:00.480
Hey, dr. Cox, please.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.889
If my dad reads
I'm at the bottom,

12:02.889 --> 12:04.317
He might lose it
and cut me off.

12:04.317 --> 12:06.557
Okay, I know I don't act
like it sometimes,

12:06.557 --> 12:10.652
But I really do want to be a doctor.
Son, that is the first honest thing you've ever said to me.

12:10.652 --> 12:12.233
Yeah, you know what it's like

12:12.233 --> 12:14.449
To have a miserable,
judgmental bastard for a dad?

12:14.449 --> 12:17.670
No. My father was so super sweet
thaty entire childhood was

12:17.670 --> 12:21.047
An endless parade of lollipops
and hugs. Of course I do.

12:21.047 --> 12:22.906
Look, I can't just move you
up in the rankings

12:22.906 --> 12:24.476
Based on nothing,
so for the next week,

12:24.476 --> 12:26.269
If I need something done,
I'll go to you.

12:26.269 --> 12:28.467
-We'll call it "extra credit."
-Great.

12:28.467 --> 12:31.676
In fact, go to bed 12. There is
a very, very large sick man

12:31.676 --> 12:35.648
There who needs an alcohol bath all over his entire body.
Thank you for the opportunity.

12:37.630 --> 12:39.687
So did he buy the whole
newsletter rankings nonsense?

12:39.687 --> 12:42.494
Like an elderly shut-in
talking to a telemarketer.

12:42.494 --> 12:43.967
Outstanding.
(mutters)

12:44.605 --> 12:45.604
Thank you for meeting me.

12:45.604 --> 12:47.944
So basically I'm looking
for a work friend,

12:47.944 --> 12:49.897
Someone to pal around with
at the hospital.

12:49.897 --> 12:52.686
I am so ready to take this
relationship to the next level,

12:52.686 --> 12:56.007
You know, mentally,
physically and emotionally.

12:56.007 --> 12:58.328
I'm sorry, did you just say
"physically"?

12:58.328 --> 13:00.103
Weird five. Get there.

13:01.911 --> 13:04.621
If you were on a desert island,
what three cds would you bring?

13:04.621 --> 13:05.850
Motorhead, metallica

13:05.850 --> 13:07.328
And the original cast recording
of "wicked."

13:07.328 --> 13:11.256
I stage-managed the, uh,
midwestern leg of the '05 tour.

13:11.256 --> 13:13.244
And, yes, kristin chenoweth
is a delight. (laughs)

13:13.244 --> 13:15.744
Why am I here again?

13:15.744 --> 13:18.369
How's the food?
This soup is amazing.

13:18.369 --> 13:21.514
Shut up, frank.
We are lucky enough to dine

13:21.515 --> 13:24.050
With an educated physician,
and you order soup?

13:24.051 --> 13:27.020
I'm sorry, dr. Turk. I'll send
him back for a sandwich,

13:27.021 --> 13:30.723
Something more fitting.
Talking about soup.

13:30.724 --> 13:33.159
(slurps)

13:33.160 --> 13:35.329
How you doing,ate?
I'm a little nervous.

13:35.329 --> 13:38.865
Is a bronchoscopy gonna hurt?
There'll be a little discomfort afterwards,

13:38.866 --> 13:39.936
But you'll be under
for the procedure,

13:39.936 --> 13:42.644
And the whole thing will be over in an hour.
And you'll be here when I wake up?

13:42.644 --> 13:47.387
Yeah, of course.
Isn't she the best?

13:47.387 --> 13:50.398
<i>I think we're all searching
for something.</i>

13:50.398 --> 13:53.567
<i>Sometimes it's a replacement
for the irreplaceable...</i>

13:53.567 --> 13:56.029
Lookit, gandhi, if you expect me
to go all the way,

13:56.029 --> 13:58.631
You gotta step up your game
a little bit here, pal.

13:58.631 --> 14:00.954
Maybe take me out
to a nice dinner,

14:00.954 --> 14:03.897
Introduce me to some of your friends.
You're not taking this seriously, are you?

14:03.897 --> 14:07.576
Not even a little, and not just
because I want nothing to do

14:07.576 --> 14:10.472
With dorian's sloppy seconds.
Work sucks.

14:10.472 --> 14:13.721
You, however, have been
lucky enough to have worked

14:13.721 --> 14:15.493
With your very best friend
for eight years.

14:15.493 --> 14:18.083
That will never,
ever happen again.

14:19.571 --> 14:21.974
<i>Other times it's just
a hard-to-reach spot</i>

14:21.974 --> 14:23.045
<i>On a fat guy's back.</i>

14:23.045 --> 14:23.756
(groans)

14:23.756 --> 14:25.976
Oh, no.

14:25.976 --> 14:27.738
Dude, a little help?

14:27.738 --> 14:29.009
Oh, isn't it terrible?

14:29.009 --> 14:30.713
Mm, awful.
Mm.

14:30.713 --> 14:31.980
(groans)

14:33.387 --> 14:35.630
So ms. Simmons is gonna wake up
in a while.

14:35.630 --> 14:37.497
Can I hang out with you
while you sit with her?

14:37.497 --> 14:40.662
<i>Lucky for me, I found
what I was looking for...</i>

14:40.662 --> 14:42.507
Please. I'm going home.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.956
<i>And she was
a lying, selfish jerk.</i>

14:47.989 --> 14:50.748
Morning, sunshine.
You look rested.

14:50.748 --> 14:52.612
Wow, and making time
for the paper, too.

14:52.612 --> 14:55.217
That must be nice.
Later, you munch.

14:55.922 --> 14:57.483
Did she just call me
"buttmunch"?

14:57.483 --> 14:59.567
Well, she didn't use the word
"butt," though I can't think

14:59.567 --> 15:01.471
Of any other prominent type
of "munch." so, yeah, I think

15:01.471 --> 15:03.226
She called you a "buttmunch."
I'm drew, by the way.

15:05.053 --> 15:07.802
So I said to the lady,
"where can a well-hung marine

15:07.802 --> 15:10.060
Buy a pair of shoes
around here?" (laughs)

15:10.060 --> 15:11.838
(laughs) I don't even know
what that is.

15:13.461 --> 15:15.385
Turkleton,
those days are gone.

15:15.385 --> 15:17.765
Dr. Kelso, really?
Please tell me

15:17.765 --> 15:19.723
You're not another one of
dr. Turk's gentleman suitors.

15:19.723 --> 15:23.294
I am indeed. I think it will be
great to have a black friend

15:23.294 --> 15:24.613
To help me out
with the sisters.

15:24.613 --> 15:28.610
Get my swirl on.
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Mm!

15:28.610 --> 15:30.477
Holy crap. That totally
looks like a korean helen hunt.

15:30.477 --> 15:32.660
No, that's
a japanese laura dern.

15:32.660 --> 15:35.375
No, it's not. I'm gonna get
my picture with her.

15:35.375 --> 15:36.661
Oh, yeah? Ah?

15:36.661 --> 15:39.667
Well--well, tell her I loved her
inapanese "jurassic park"!

15:39.667 --> 15:42.185
Hey, you came here with me.
Why you talking to her?

15:42.185 --> 15:44.544
No, I'm still here with you. (mutters)
what the hell am I doing?

15:44.544 --> 15:46.950
I always end up
in relationships like this.

15:46.950 --> 15:49.125
For once, get out
with some dignity, bob.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.236
Don't ever call me again.

15:53.371 --> 15:54.567
No, it's okay.

15:55.884 --> 15:57.113
Hey, crazy swimsuit girl.

15:57.113 --> 15:59.433
What are you doing?
Volunteering at physical therapy.

15:59.433 --> 16:02.234
I'm stretching mr. Biegel's hamstring.
Stop. He'll be fine.

16:02.234 --> 16:04.646
How do you know?
He works in the gift shop.

16:06.276 --> 16:08.660
You get what you can get.
Please leave.

16:11.312 --> 16:13.503
The baby isn't mine, is it?
Get out, kevin.

16:14.351 --> 16:17.558
Question--when you called me
"munch," were you referring

16:17.558 --> 16:19.335
To richard belzer's
beloved detective character

16:19.335 --> 16:20.509
First established
on "homicide"

16:20.509 --> 16:22.317
But best known
from "law & order: S.V.U."?

16:22.317 --> 16:24.124
Crime procedurals
soothe the baby.

16:24.771 --> 16:26.582
Luckily, there is a different
one on every nine seconds.

16:26.582 --> 16:28.790
You walked out on ms. Simmons
when she needed you.

16:28.790 --> 16:32.739
I to stay with her all night. She faked out.
She did?

16:33.178 --> 16:34.200
Can I get you anything?

16:34.200 --> 16:34.908
<i>(funk music playing)
(mouths words)</i>

16:37.761 --> 16:38.934
Yeah. (scoffs)

16:38.934 --> 16:41.225
It got real in there,
big-time.

16:41.225 --> 16:44.710
Plus, I got no sleep and I had
so much do this morning,

16:44.710 --> 16:46.187
I had to do
my dad phone call

16:46.187 --> 16:47.754
While having sex
with my boyfriend.

16:47.754 --> 16:50.136
So many things wrong with that,
not the least of which

16:50.136 --> 16:53.340
Is the fact that it's the most
turned on I've ever been.
No filter, huh?

16:53.340 --> 16:55.269
Nope.
Lucy, there was a hospital

16:55.269 --> 16:56.565
Full of residents and nurses
here last night.

16:56.565 --> 16:58.019
If there was a problem
with ms. Simmons,

16:58.019 --> 17:00.770
I would have been called.
Stop making excuses.

17:00.770 --> 17:02.968
You know, I thought
you could do everything,

17:02.968 --> 17:04.113
But I guess it just seems
that way

17:04.113 --> 17:08.508
Because you half-ass it with your patients.
(gasps) come with me.

17:08.998 --> 17:11.862
Hey, dr. Cox. I just finished
cleaning that guy's foot ulcer.

17:11.862 --> 17:14.617
How'd that go for you?
Not gonna lie, I yakked on his face.

17:14.617 --> 17:16.185
Otherwise...
(singsongy) crushed it.

17:16.185 --> 17:17.075
(normal voice)
what else can I do?

17:17.075 --> 17:19.833
Actually, drew here was about
to assist me with something.

17:19.833 --> 17:22.589
Oh, yeah, yeah. No, I got it. What's the job?
Sorry, charlie, this is my deal.

17:22.589 --> 17:24.971
No, you know what, drew?
Cole's been really stepping up,

17:24.971 --> 17:27.212
Showing some promise.
I'm gonna let him do this one.

17:27.756 --> 17:30.738
Room 32. I want you to do
a manual rectal disimpactation.

17:30.738 --> 17:34.811
<i>Mr. Hanson is very constipated.</i>

17:34.811 --> 17:36.055
You will fix that...

17:36.055 --> 17:38.396
With your hands.

17:38.396 --> 17:40.660
(whispers) oh, lucky!

17:40.660 --> 17:42.438
(flatly) yay.

17:45.697 --> 17:46.385
"sorry, charlie"?

17:46.385 --> 17:48.029
I thought it was brilliant.
Eh.

17:54.518 --> 17:56.194
Mr. Valadez is gonna need
another surgery, huh?

17:56.711 --> 18:00.097
Yep. I don't think
he's gonna be able to take it.

18:01.004 --> 18:02.197
That totally sucks.

18:04.892 --> 18:05.901
Um...

18:06.844 --> 18:10.681
If you want, uh, today's
eileen in radiology's birthday,

18:10.481 --> 18:12.531
And I was gonna go up there
and just steal her cake.

18:13.642 --> 18:14.643
I hate eileen in radiology.

18:15.367 --> 18:16.654
I'm definitely in.

18:16.854 --> 18:19.624
She's so nice, it makes me want to cut her throat.
I know, right?

18:19.624 --> 18:22.110
I was thinking, after that,
maybe we could stop on three

18:22.110 --> 18:24.909
And then I'd show you the nurse that looks like--
looks like nigerian kelly ripa?

18:24.909 --> 18:25.929
Thank you!

18:27.756 --> 18:29.911
Lucy, ms. Simmons needs
a new I.V. Placed.

18:29.911 --> 18:32.660
Let's say, uh,
you take a shot at it.

18:32.960 --> 18:33.973
Yeah...

18:34.373 --> 18:36.492
I, um...

18:36.659 --> 18:40.523
Your hands are a little shaky there.
I'm jacked up on 17 cups of coffee

18:40.523 --> 18:42.910
Because I haven't slept a lot
lately and my head is sweating.

18:43.950 --> 18:44.671
But I'll be fine.

18:46.263 --> 18:48.369
(gasps) don't you think
you should disinfect the area?

18:48.369 --> 18:50.931
Good catch, kate.
What do you think, lucy--

18:50.931 --> 18:53.248
Should we wipe away
all the deadly bacteria

18:53.248 --> 18:55.029
Or just do this
civil-war style?

18:58.194 --> 19:00.043
I really shouldn't be
doing this.

19:00.043 --> 19:01.273
No, you shouldn't.

19:01.273 --> 19:04.068
(whispers) one second.

19:06.463 --> 19:09.813
Once again, a giant swing
and a miss for lucy bennett.

19:09.813 --> 19:11.025
What's wrong with me?

19:11.460 --> 19:13.634
Lucy, when I got pregnant,
I learned two things--

19:13.950 --> 19:15.380
Ketchup on cereal
is delicious,

19:15.673 --> 19:17.466
And sometimes
you have to be selfish.

19:18.296 --> 19:19.322
That's why I went home
last night.

19:19.322 --> 19:21.211
I mean, finally I have
something inside me

19:21.211 --> 19:24.078
Forcing me to take care
of myself. See, I'm like you.

19:24.078 --> 19:25.103
I probably ended up
in medicine

19:25.103 --> 19:27.062
Because I want to try to
take care of the whole world.

19:27.705 --> 19:29.616
But here's the crazy thing
about being a doctor--

19:30.152 --> 19:32.198
You can't even take care
of one single patient

19:32.930 --> 19:34.614
Unless you learn how to
take ce of yourself first.

19:35.947 --> 19:37.451
So tell your dad
you can't talk every day,

19:37.451 --> 19:39.367
Have your boyfriend grab a cold
shower every once in a while,

19:39.367 --> 19:41.302
Stop doing slides
for dr. Turk

19:41.302 --> 19:42.722
And let your sister
mess up her own life.

19:42.722 --> 19:44.440
That's the key
to being a good doctor--

19:44.440 --> 19:49.080
You first, then the world.
Now go home and get some sleep.

19:52.915 --> 19:55.607
<i>I guess there are lots of ways
to get by in a hospital.</i>

19:55.607 --> 19:58.542
<i>You can just try to suck it up...
Ugh.</i>

19:58.542 --> 20:01.323
<i>Or find someone to make
the day-to-day hell bearable.</i>

20:01.323 --> 20:04.043
(mouth full) mmm. Mmm.
(mouth full)
mmm. Get the middle.

20:05.240 --> 20:08.480
<i>For me, it was just about
learning who comes first.</i>

20:08.480 --> 20:08.890
(cell phone rings)

20:09.447 --> 20:11.269
(beep)

20:13.000 --> 20:19.074

20:22.578 --> 20:26.314
(singsongy) ole king cole is
in the house!

20:26.348 --> 20:27.691
(normal voice) hey, did
everybody see the newsletter?

20:27.691 --> 20:28.690
Check it out.

20:28.690 --> 20:32.361
Number one--aaronson, cole.

20:33.011 --> 20:34.838
Isn't that just
an alphabetized list

20:34.838 --> 20:36.474
Of all the students in our class?
Yep.

20:36.776 --> 20:38.565
You gonna tell him?
I haven't decided.

20:39.152 --> 20:41.616
Oh, too bad, bennett, lucy.

20:41.616 --> 20:43.964
(laughs)
what happened, suffin?

20:43.964 --> 20:45.495
You're, like, two-thirds
of the way down this thing.

20:45.495 --> 20:47.790
That is rough!
I don't know, but congratulations.

20:47.790 --> 20:50.738
Yep, old double-a aaronson
nailed it again.

20:50.738 --> 20:52.417
You suck, zimmerman!
