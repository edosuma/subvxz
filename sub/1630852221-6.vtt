WEBVTT

03:44.400 --> 03:46.080
Donna Nunzia...

03:46.159 --> 03:47.520
you don't have to.

03:48.400 --> 03:51.159
No, I need to see it with my own eyes.

04:20.680 --> 04:27.560
GOMORRA

04:45.759 --> 04:47.319
That rat screwed us,

04:47.399 --> 04:50.279
we gotta find him
before he gets organized again.

04:50.360 --> 04:52.079
Calm down now.

04:52.160 --> 04:53.560
Think.

04:56.680 --> 04:59.759
If I was him, no home, no defenses,

04:59.839 --> 05:02.639
I'd get the people around me
to protect me.

05:04.120 --> 05:06.439
There's only one place
Ciro Di Marzio can be.

05:06.519 --> 05:08.079
In Forcella.

05:09.639 --> 05:12.000
But we don't have contacts in Forcella.

05:12.079 --> 05:14.519
There's no need,

05:14.600 --> 05:17.120
we got something better.

05:17.199 --> 05:19.160
The money to buy everyone.

05:21.560 --> 05:23.879
- You take care of it, Lil Monk.
- You got it.

05:25.399 --> 05:26.959
Let's go, Mistral.

05:45.839 --> 05:46.759
Well?

05:49.680 --> 05:53.000
- Gentleman's widow's taken care of.
- Did you kill her?

05:53.079 --> 05:54.160
No need.

05:58.199 --> 06:00.160
So it's not over.

06:01.519 --> 06:03.079
And Ciro?

06:07.680 --> 06:10.360
Genna'... we're not safe even here.

06:11.680 --> 06:14.720
That's because you didn't listen to me.

06:16.959 --> 06:18.720
I can't sleep anymore.

06:19.319 --> 06:22.160
- Pietro could have died.
- But he didn't!

06:24.000 --> 06:26.319
Now you're here with me, you're safe.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.800
I'm glad there's so many of you.

07:35.879 --> 07:38.319
Curiosity's a good thing.

07:38.399 --> 07:40.959
My brother told you
I got an offer for you.

07:46.199 --> 07:47.920
This is the offer.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.639
A lotta cash to anyone giving information
about Ciro Di Marzio and Blue Blood.

07:52.720 --> 07:54.279
You're sure they're here?

07:54.360 --> 07:57.600
I'm sure money makes blindmen see.

07:57.680 --> 08:00.240
I'm here, spread the word.

08:10.199 --> 08:12.240
What if I don't want the money?

08:13.519 --> 08:17.399
He was with Blue Blood,
they were companions.

08:18.160 --> 08:19.600
But that's the past.

08:20.399 --> 08:23.000
- Do you know where they are?
- I don't.

08:25.360 --> 08:28.040
But if I find out, it's not money I want.

08:41.720 --> 08:43.200
I spoke to him.

08:43.279 --> 08:47.080
If we get information
about them, we're back in.

08:47.159 --> 08:50.480
A shipment's coming in two days,
so we gotta get moving.

08:53.480 --> 08:57.240
We'll get our spots back
and start dealing again!

08:57.320 --> 08:59.799
It's the only way things can go back
to how they were.

08:59.879 --> 09:02.840
Cantonese, I don't wanna miss
this chance.

09:04.039 --> 09:05.639
I don't know where Blue Blood is.

09:07.480 --> 09:11.360
Last time I saw him, he was
on his knees crying to Mary.

09:11.440 --> 09:15.039
And the last time we saw Ciro Di Marzio
we threw him into the sea.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.799
It's in the past, MMA,
I don't wanna think about it.

09:18.360 --> 09:22.000
Well, you oughta.
Aren't you over being broke?

09:24.960 --> 09:26.679
I'll call you.

10:22.519 --> 10:24.279
It's Cantonese.

10:33.080 --> 10:34.120
Well?

10:35.039 --> 10:36.840
Gennaro sent a guy

10:36.919 --> 10:40.039
and he's offering money
to find out where you are.

10:41.240 --> 10:45.159
- Only you know that.
- You think no one else will find out?

10:45.919 --> 10:50.480
MMA asked to be paid in cocaine.
A shipment's arriving in two days.

10:50.559 --> 10:52.480
- What did you tell him?
- Nothing.

10:52.559 --> 10:56.559
Forcella's not safe,
Gennaro's got eyes and ears all over.

10:57.399 --> 10:59.399
We gotta get outta here.

10:59.480 --> 11:02.360
We need a safe place, some help.

11:02.440 --> 11:04.159
I'll go talk to a guy

11:04.240 --> 11:06.759
and I'll see
if the place I say still exists.

11:09.879 --> 11:13.440
- Can you get me out tonight?
- No, I'll go.

11:13.519 --> 11:16.039
- I got a better chance on my own.
- Gennaro wants me.

11:16.120 --> 11:18.039
That's why you can't go.

11:24.480 --> 11:28.159
You know what these
three crosses on my neck mean?

11:28.240 --> 11:31.720
Jesus Christ got killed
to save everybody.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.759
You already died once because of me,
now it's my turn.

11:40.720 --> 11:43.080
Just tell me what I gotta do.

12:08.559 --> 12:09.679
Azzurra...

12:10.879 --> 12:12.159
What do you want?

12:12.679 --> 12:14.519
We're having guests.

12:15.360 --> 12:18.720
Angelo Mistral and his wife
Donna Luciana are coming.

12:18.799 --> 12:21.200
She's smart, you'll like her.

12:24.919 --> 12:26.360
What if I don't like her?

12:28.919 --> 12:30.840
Some company will do you good.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.519
I'll wait for you downstairs.

12:53.879 --> 12:55.519
You needn't worry,

12:55.600 --> 12:58.679
my wife's good with people,
she gets them.

13:00.720 --> 13:03.679
I just need to know
someone's always with her,

13:03.759 --> 13:05.840
to put my mind at rest.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.679
Besides, we got other problems.

13:09.759 --> 13:11.000
Forcella.

13:22.519 --> 13:23.639
Well?

13:23.720 --> 13:28.080
People here like to talk,
but talk doesn't get you very far.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.240
We might have some good news.

13:35.399 --> 13:38.879
- We're going to check it out.
- Good, be quick.

13:40.879 --> 13:42.799
- Ready?
- Go.

14:03.600 --> 14:07.080
Men talk business
and women clean up...

14:10.799 --> 14:12.720
Can I give you a hand?

14:12.799 --> 14:14.799
You want to be a waitress?

14:16.960 --> 14:20.320
I met my husband
when I was a waitress, at 16.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.759
At 18 I was married
and at 19 I was worse than a widow,

14:24.840 --> 14:26.919
with a husband behind bars.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.559
I waited for him for 20 years.

14:35.519 --> 14:38.440
But I feel blessed every day
for having met him,

14:38.519 --> 14:40.559
while I was working as a waitress.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.159
But now you're spying for my husband.

14:48.720 --> 14:52.559
He ordered me to stay with you,
I have no choice and neither do you.

14:57.639 --> 15:00.279
But as for what we say to each other...

15:01.120 --> 15:03.720
I decide what to tell him
and what not to.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.679
Or you can choose
not to tell me anything,

15:09.320 --> 15:11.159
so you're more relaxed.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.279
I don't have secrets.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.399
Even better.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.359
There's no one here, let's go.

17:17.440 --> 17:18.720
You asleep? Move!

17:40.599 --> 17:42.480
What did you think of her?

17:43.400 --> 17:45.359
She's not an easy woman.

17:46.480 --> 17:48.480
Can you believe Gennaro!

17:48.559 --> 17:53.240
Lil Monk goes after the Immortal
and we're babysitting his wife.

17:54.759 --> 17:56.359
You don't get it.

17:57.680 --> 18:00.599
For Gennaro,
his wife is the most important thing

18:01.400 --> 18:04.799
and he asked us
to look after her, not him.

18:05.440 --> 18:08.440
If he loses the war at home,
he loses outside too.

18:09.279 --> 18:11.839
Azzurra's the key to controlling Gennaro.

18:17.599 --> 18:20.160
And Lil Monk made
a mistake tonight, or not?

18:23.559 --> 18:25.960
Your moment will come.

18:28.880 --> 18:30.799
Luciana, do you love me?

18:31.799 --> 18:34.359
Watch out for that woman,
she's not stupid.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.319
You're right.

18:43.279 --> 18:46.039
But if you're locked in a cage like her,

18:46.119 --> 18:49.400
the one holding the keys
becomes your best friend.

19:17.200 --> 19:18.480
Cantonese!

19:25.759 --> 19:29.079
- You didn't call.
- Didn't have nothin' to say.

19:29.160 --> 19:31.079
You haven't heard from Enzo?

19:36.839 --> 19:38.759
Maybe I know where they are.

19:39.359 --> 19:41.000
Where?

19:41.559 --> 19:42.880
Are you with me?

19:45.039 --> 19:46.960
I'm tired.

19:47.039 --> 19:50.480
If you knew where Blue Blood was
you wouldn't tell me.

19:51.119 --> 19:53.000
It doesn't look like you're that rich.

19:53.079 --> 19:55.799
I thought
you wanted to end this situation.

19:55.880 --> 19:59.319
End it how?
We all end up in the cemetery.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.839
If it wasn't for Ciro, we'd still
be happily eating Carmela's pizzas.

20:02.920 --> 20:06.079
But he wanted an army,
Enzo followed him,

20:06.160 --> 20:08.720
then us, dicking around behind him.

20:08.799 --> 20:12.640
- They're to blame for all those deaths.
- And we're saints?

20:14.240 --> 20:15.920
You remember Valerio?

20:17.160 --> 20:18.720
Little Elio?

20:20.240 --> 20:22.519
Have you already forgotten our brothers?

20:25.160 --> 20:27.160
So, you're sure?

20:32.119 --> 20:34.079
I'm tired, I'm going to bed.

21:10.079 --> 21:12.160
Darling, be careful, don't fall.

21:17.279 --> 21:19.240
Isn't the boy going to school?

21:20.319 --> 21:22.079
He's safer here.

21:23.839 --> 21:27.680
- But this isn't a playground.
- Better than being stuck inside.

21:30.359 --> 21:32.079
He's so cute.

21:32.839 --> 21:34.440
He's my whole life.

21:36.079 --> 21:37.599
Don't you want kids?

21:39.279 --> 21:41.240
My sister always says to me:

21:41.319 --> 21:44.079
"Why don't you have a kid?
He could play with his cousins."

21:46.920 --> 21:48.839
Angelo and I are fine the way we are.

21:51.039 --> 21:54.720
At least you won't feel guilty
making him play in a place like this.

22:00.119 --> 22:03.160
It's a tough moment, but it'll pass.

22:03.240 --> 22:05.160
It's not a moment.

22:05.759 --> 22:07.720
Our whole life's like this.

22:08.599 --> 22:11.279
Gennaro's made too many enemies.

22:11.359 --> 22:13.279
Gennaro's winning.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.240
Ciro's got nothing.

22:20.880 --> 22:23.519
Afterwards, it'll go back the way it was.

22:23.599 --> 22:25.480
How was that?

22:28.559 --> 22:30.759
You were right not to have kids.

22:32.240 --> 22:34.559
I love Pietro more than anything,

22:37.079 --> 22:40.039
but when I think it's my fault
that this is his life,

22:40.119 --> 22:42.079
I wish I'd never had him.

23:09.480 --> 23:11.680
They're looking for us all over Forcella.

23:11.759 --> 23:15.519
But it didn't work out
for that rat Lil Monk. We're still here.

23:16.119 --> 23:19.200
Now they'll be even more pissed off,
we're not safe here.

23:19.279 --> 23:20.960
We gotta leave.

23:47.880 --> 23:49.799
- Cantonese!
- We gotta go.

23:49.880 --> 23:51.079
They're up our ass.

23:51.160 --> 23:53.720
We gotta hurry,
we don't have much time.

23:53.799 --> 23:54.720
Go!

24:14.599 --> 24:17.240
This tip-off's a good one, I can feel it.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.519
Where's Ciro and Enzo?

24:25.039 --> 24:28.000
Put the gun on the table.
You too, Pitbull.

24:28.079 --> 24:29.240
Put it down!

24:30.920 --> 24:32.559
Put it down.

24:37.839 --> 24:39.240
- That's it.
- You're a rat!

24:40.759 --> 24:44.160
Time's up.
I wanna know where Ciro and Enzo are.

24:45.960 --> 24:47.920
Where are they?

24:48.000 --> 24:50.480
Tell me or I'll blow your head off!

24:52.880 --> 24:54.160
Go, go!

25:14.519 --> 25:15.440
Go!

25:26.480 --> 25:29.559
Ciro! Quick, we gotta go!

25:34.279 --> 25:36.279
Quick! They're coming!

25:36.359 --> 25:38.160
Quick, go!

25:38.240 --> 25:39.480
Come on, guys.

25:49.559 --> 25:50.799
Cantonese!

25:54.480 --> 25:55.680
Go!

25:56.359 --> 25:58.799
Cosimo, you okay?

25:58.880 --> 26:01.440
Look what that fucking bastard did to me!

26:01.519 --> 26:04.079
Lemme see... it's a scratch.

26:04.960 --> 26:08.039
- We got it wrong.
- Chill out, don't move.

26:41.039 --> 26:43.480
- How the fuck did he get away?
- They had help.

26:43.559 --> 26:45.279
- From who?
- We don't know.

26:45.359 --> 26:47.160
Were they ghosts too?

26:47.240 --> 26:50.720
Tear Naples apart,
I wanna know who his allies are!

26:50.799 --> 26:52.920
Take all the men you need.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.079
And the shipment?

26:58.200 --> 27:00.119
Me and Mistral will take care of it.

27:20.720 --> 27:23.480
She wanted to meet you in person
before deciding.

27:26.960 --> 27:29.319
Where are the guys?

27:29.400 --> 27:31.640
On their way to where you said.

27:32.240 --> 27:33.880
You found it?

27:35.480 --> 27:37.599
- It's still standing?
- Yeah.

28:12.920 --> 28:14.960
It's easier for you Turks.

28:23.319 --> 28:27.279
This is Akim, he's supervising
the delivery tomorrow.

28:27.359 --> 28:29.680
Don't worry about
the Gentleman's widow.

28:29.759 --> 28:32.559
As long as she's alive,
I prefer to be prudent.

28:36.440 --> 28:38.640
I know I asked you for a lot,

28:38.720 --> 28:40.559
but it'll be worth it.

28:45.119 --> 28:47.079
This is the place.

28:51.279 --> 28:55.359
You'll get the time tomorrow,
an hour before the arrival.

28:56.359 --> 28:58.079
To be on the safe side.

29:44.920 --> 29:46.960
It's a pleasure to meet you.

29:47.920 --> 29:52.000
I always thought
only God Almighty was immortal.

29:52.079 --> 29:53.160
Thank you for the help.

29:56.160 --> 29:58.000
You like cyclamens?

29:58.880 --> 30:01.559
They're strange flowers,
pretty, colorful...

30:02.599 --> 30:04.839
You give them to wish good luck.

30:06.799 --> 30:08.000
But they're dangerous,

30:08.519 --> 30:11.799
because although they're pretty,
they're poisonous.

30:13.480 --> 30:16.359
Their true meaning is mistrust.

30:18.759 --> 30:20.759
My husband used to say

30:20.839 --> 30:24.119
that luck and mistrust
go hand in hand

30:24.839 --> 30:28.359
because a lucky man
never trusts anyone.

30:28.440 --> 30:30.119
Your husband was a wise man.

30:30.799 --> 30:31.960
And you?

30:34.039 --> 30:36.720
We were supposed to talk
about Gennaro Savastano.

30:36.799 --> 30:39.480
I know him,
even though I've never met him.

30:39.559 --> 30:41.680
I don't know you.

30:42.519 --> 30:44.480
I was curious.

30:44.559 --> 30:47.440
Your friend risked a lot to find me.

30:48.279 --> 30:51.480
Gennaro Savastano's
looking for you everywhere.

30:53.400 --> 30:57.000
I was curious
to see a man worth dying for.

31:17.839 --> 31:19.119
Why'd you call us down?

31:19.640 --> 31:22.400
Thought you might like some fresh air.

31:23.200 --> 31:25.160
Did Gennaro say we could go out?

31:25.240 --> 31:28.640
He said to look after you,
I think it'll do you good to get out.

31:30.599 --> 31:33.359
It'll be trouble for you too, you know?

31:33.440 --> 31:34.720
Let's go.

31:36.839 --> 31:38.160
Get in, sweetheart.

32:02.759 --> 32:05.839
Smoking's bad for you,
nobody ever told you that?

32:05.920 --> 32:08.079
Lots of stuff's bad for you.

32:11.599 --> 32:12.839
Thanks.

32:22.119 --> 32:24.079
Why should I join forces with you?

32:27.039 --> 32:28.880
Because you'd be better off.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.640
You know it.

32:32.720 --> 32:36.839
Better off how?
You got nothing to offer except anger.

32:41.440 --> 32:44.680
I got the only thing that can
get you to Gennaro Savastano.

32:46.839 --> 32:48.759
I know him better than anyone.

33:03.400 --> 33:06.319
And knowing your enemy
is the most important thing.

33:09.799 --> 33:11.839
I learned this the hard way.

33:17.119 --> 33:19.039
I made you some coffee.

33:23.319 --> 33:24.880
It's an honor, Mrs. Savastano.

33:26.359 --> 33:27.640
What honor, Lavinia?

33:27.720 --> 33:29.400
Look how cute they are.

33:42.039 --> 33:43.400
Thanks, Luciana.

34:15.199 --> 34:16.280
We're in.

34:18.239 --> 34:19.159
Okay.

35:33.559 --> 35:35.639
- Are you tired, sweetheart?
- Yes.

35:36.920 --> 35:38.760
Let's go to bed.

35:44.360 --> 35:45.679
Go on, little man.

36:07.239 --> 36:10.079
Go brush your teeth, I'll be right there.

36:16.119 --> 36:19.199
When I heard you went out
I couldn't believe it.

36:19.280 --> 36:23.639
Is she that dumb she went out
after they tried to kill her?

36:24.039 --> 36:27.000
If you keep me locked in here,
I'll die anyway.

36:28.119 --> 36:32.400
Your men were everywhere,
nothing could have happened.

36:32.480 --> 36:35.159
There coulda been a hundred men,

36:35.239 --> 36:37.440
but if he wants to kill you,
he'll kill you.

36:39.079 --> 36:43.320
- From tomorrow, Luciana's not coming.
- No... Luciana's coming tomorrow.

36:45.400 --> 36:48.360
- You really want to play this game.
- It's not a game.

36:49.559 --> 36:51.159
It's my life.

37:06.159 --> 37:07.719
How did it go?

37:10.280 --> 37:11.880
You did a good job.

37:16.039 --> 37:17.480
It's all okay.

37:17.920 --> 37:20.159
The guys got the shipment.

37:29.239 --> 37:31.800
The time's come to make a call.

37:38.559 --> 37:40.719
The shipment's on its way, let's move.

37:53.639 --> 37:56.119
What did Gennaro say
about you going out?

37:56.840 --> 37:58.679
Only that I can't go out.

37:59.400 --> 38:00.800
I'm sorry.

38:01.480 --> 38:02.880
I'm not.

38:04.039 --> 38:06.400
I hadn't seen Pietro so happy in ages.

38:08.360 --> 38:10.159
I wanna thank you.

38:11.280 --> 38:13.119
But he's right.

38:14.400 --> 38:17.159
Until this war with Ciro is over,

38:17.239 --> 38:19.280
I can't go out.

38:24.320 --> 38:27.599
I took the liberty of preparing
a surprise for the boy.

38:32.719 --> 38:33.760
Come and see.

38:47.559 --> 38:50.400
I thought if he can't go
to the playground,

38:50.480 --> 38:52.599
we'll bring the playground to him.

38:57.320 --> 38:58.960
Pietro!

38:59.039 --> 39:00.840
Come and have a look, darling!

40:10.280 --> 40:12.000
Open it, it's this one.

40:13.639 --> 40:15.599
But where's Akim and the Russians?

41:54.119 --> 41:55.079
Please.

41:55.719 --> 41:58.440
I told you what time
the shipment arrives.

41:58.519 --> 42:02.039
I called Gennaro,
now please, let me go.

42:02.760 --> 42:04.480
It's not enough for your sins.

42:06.920 --> 42:10.280
I only did what Gennaro asked me to.

42:10.360 --> 42:12.239
I didn't have a choice!

42:12.320 --> 42:14.320
You could have chosen to die.

42:15.239 --> 42:19.079
You got the shipment, you won.
Please, let me go!

42:19.800 --> 42:22.599
You know who didn't have a choice?
My husband.

42:23.639 --> 42:28.920
You, that rat Gennaro and
his right-hand man decided for him.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.400
You decided that if he died
it didn't matter to anyone.

42:32.800 --> 42:37.000
But you were wrong,
because it mattered to me.

42:38.639 --> 42:40.920
He was my whole life

42:41.000 --> 42:45.079
and I swore on his grave
that I wouldn't rest

42:45.159 --> 42:48.920
until everyone who killed him
was worm food.

42:55.679 --> 42:57.599
But don't worry.

42:57.960 --> 42:59.960
You're nobody.

43:01.280 --> 43:02.920
One shot's enough for you.

43:04.840 --> 43:06.920
No, wait.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.440
Please.

43:08.519 --> 43:10.599
Don't kill me, please!

43:10.679 --> 43:12.320
No, don't do it! Don't kill me!

43:27.880 --> 43:31.599
You got what you wanted:
revenge and the shipment.

43:31.679 --> 43:35.800
You can keep the shipment
and my vengeance has just begun.

43:36.320 --> 43:39.840
Still, you did well,
you did what you said you would.

43:39.920 --> 43:41.559
Now what do you want?

43:43.440 --> 43:45.440
I wanna arm my men.

44:25.119 --> 44:26.800
It was here, right?

44:30.079 --> 44:34.199
And you wanna make war
and equip an army in here?

44:34.280 --> 44:36.559
It's all falling down.

44:37.480 --> 44:39.440
What is this place?

44:42.920 --> 44:45.679
It's the only place I missed.

45:21.440 --> 45:23.440
IN THE NEXT EPISODE
