00:01.126 --> 00:02.626
_

00:02.651 --> 00:04.796
Is it mine?

00:05.367 --> 00:07.016
- Yeah.
- I have a patient

00:07.041 --> 00:08.486
who I know you're gonna wanna help her.

00:08.510 --> 00:11.478
- Are you offering to kill me?
- If that's what you want.

00:11.660 --> 00:12.836
No, it's not.

00:12.861 --> 00:15.597
I want you to end Dorothy's suffering,

00:15.622 --> 00:17.036
like you did with Gail.

00:17.052 --> 00:19.147
What if this hospice is a cover?

00:19.172 --> 00:20.294
What if she found a place

00:20.319 --> 00:22.761
where she can get a bunch of
terminal patients together?

00:22.786 --> 00:25.659
- Kill them?
- I think we need to do Robert today.

00:25.694 --> 00:29.023
He's afraid he's gonna die in
his sleep before we get to him.

00:29.048 --> 00:32.031
- Where's Dr. Harris?
- Robert didn't want you, did he?

00:32.055 --> 00:35.503
- He wanted Mary, not you.
- Do you ever feel crazy?

00:35.528 --> 00:38.646
Yeah, do you? No! Get down!

00:38.671 --> 00:41.083
Lucy? What are you doing here?

00:41.108 --> 00:42.528
Sleeping with a patient!

00:42.553 --> 00:43.614
Do you know how pathetic that is?

00:43.638 --> 00:45.568
You don't understand!
It's not like that!

00:46.209 --> 00:49.420
People get far too sentimental
when it comes to death.

00:49.445 --> 00:51.619
But that's what I'm here for.

Woo!

01:42.758 --> 01:44.326
Okay. Easy, there.

01:45.962 --> 01:48.217
Don't forget me when you
become a famous silks artist.

01:48.242 --> 01:51.812
- Name one famous silks artist.
- You will be the first.

01:59.038 --> 02:00.522
What about that new Thai place?

02:00.547 --> 02:02.121
You wanna walk all
the way there in this?

02:02.145 --> 02:03.881
Yeah, sure. Sounds... good.

02:04.647 --> 02:07.510
Okay. You do not wanna
go out tonight, do you?

02:07.535 --> 02:09.109
Babe, it's just I'm
still fighting this cold,

02:09.133 --> 02:11.418
- and I've got that performance next week.
- Don't worry about it.

02:11.442 --> 02:13.677
It's totally fine.
We'll pick up some soup,

02:13.711 --> 02:15.821
snuggle under the blankets,
watch something stupid?

02:16.103 --> 02:17.681
Sounds like a perfect night to me.

02:17.715 --> 02:19.716
- Ugh. Sorry I'm so lame.
- Hey!

02:19.814 --> 02:21.752
It's not lame to let
someone take care of you.

02:22.399 --> 02:24.440
Have you ever thought that
I might actually want to?

02:28.328 --> 02:31.561
Okay. But if I fall asleep,
you have to promise...

02:31.586 --> 02:34.521
Leah!

02:37.146 --> 02:39.781
Leah! Leah!

02:39.806 --> 02:42.215
Help!

Leah, how's your pain
on a scale of 1 to 10?

03:01.926 --> 03:03.627
- 10.
- I need to hear it from Leah.

03:03.652 --> 03:05.773
Just give her something to
make her feel better, Jesus.

03:05.797 --> 03:09.599
Babe... maybe you could
get me some ice chips?

03:10.262 --> 03:12.817
Of course. Be right back, okay?

03:22.513 --> 03:25.012
- I don't want this.
- Leah, if you're in pain,

03:25.037 --> 03:26.998
- take the medication.
- Not that.

03:27.611 --> 03:29.209
You heard the doctor:

03:30.849 --> 03:33.490
fractured skull, cracked vertebrae.

03:34.101 --> 03:35.235
It's still early.

03:36.169 --> 03:37.997
And recovery is a process.

03:38.022 --> 03:39.790
But they're saying I might not...

03:43.582 --> 03:44.785
If that's true,

03:46.621 --> 03:47.829
I want out.

03:50.316 --> 03:51.608
You should get some sleep.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.644
Your body's been through a trauma.

03:56.668 --> 03:58.988
- _
- You're in shock.

03:59.013 --> 04:01.548
What would you do?

04:02.365 --> 04:04.455
Can't move. Can't work.

04:05.482 --> 04:08.632
The people you love feeding
you and wiping your ass

04:08.659 --> 04:10.327
and feeling sorry for you.

04:13.431 --> 04:16.017
Can you honestly tell
me you'd choose that?

04:19.507 --> 04:21.088
Even if that happens,

04:21.416 --> 04:22.750
and that's still an if,

04:23.890 --> 04:25.977
there are different
ways to live a life...

04:27.979 --> 04:30.347
... ways that have just as much value.

04:33.475 --> 04:35.309
Well, this is my life.

04:37.100 --> 04:38.901
And I think it should be up to me.

04:43.609 --> 04:45.395
Accidents... happen.

04:45.730 --> 04:48.088
You look away for a minute
and then when you turn back,

04:48.113 --> 04:49.314
everything's different.

04:50.001 --> 04:53.803
Robert was such a light around here,

04:53.828 --> 04:55.648
and we will all miss him terribly.

04:55.673 --> 04:58.219
That's nice, but it doesn't
explain how he froze to death.

04:58.449 --> 05:01.055
I had given Robert sleep
aids to control the agitation.

05:01.080 --> 05:03.324
We had absolutely no reason to assume

05:03.349 --> 05:05.449
- he wasn't asleep in his room.
- But he wasn't.

05:06.159 --> 05:08.667
He was outside, alone.

05:08.846 --> 05:10.417
Honestly, I'm very concerned,

05:10.442 --> 05:11.956
and that's why I'm back here again.

05:11.981 --> 05:13.886
- Dr. Carter...
- It's your responsibility

05:13.911 --> 05:15.524
to care for these people.

05:15.549 --> 05:18.504
Dr. Carter, I've spent
my life caring for people.

05:19.277 --> 05:21.031
I left my job at Eden General

05:21.056 --> 05:22.371
to open this hospice.

05:22.767 --> 05:24.801
I spend countless nights and weekends

05:24.835 --> 05:27.170
away from my children,
and my heart breaks

05:27.195 --> 05:29.864
for every patient I lose,
no matter how inevitable.

05:29.889 --> 05:32.057
So, please don't question my dedication.

05:33.074 --> 05:34.655
There's no one more
committed to helping people

05:34.679 --> 05:36.039
at the end of their lives than me.

05:39.760 --> 05:41.561
What happened? What did she say?

05:41.586 --> 05:44.088
- It was fine.
- You call that fine?

05:44.622 --> 05:46.224
The coroner has been
here twice this week

05:46.249 --> 05:48.817
- for the exact same case.
- And now, it's closed.

05:50.153 --> 05:51.715
But we can't have people

05:51.740 --> 05:53.856
digging into this place and what you do.

05:55.270 --> 05:57.222
I know, Nicole.

05:57.247 --> 05:59.331
Our patients pay us to die beautifully

05:59.356 --> 06:01.136
and die beautifully they must.

06:01.161 --> 06:03.294
That is so rich coming
from someone like you,

06:03.692 --> 06:04.997
Mr. Bedside Manner.

06:05.388 --> 06:07.978
So, Mary, you help the patients

06:08.003 --> 06:09.071
and Des screws them.

06:09.762 --> 06:12.737
Now, if you had given
Robert some of the attention

06:12.762 --> 06:14.580
that you gave Lucy, he would've let you

06:14.605 --> 06:16.620
end his life and none of
this would've happened.

06:16.783 --> 06:19.456
Which is why Des is going to
take the lead on the next death.

06:19.490 --> 06:21.933
- Sorry, what?
- Robert didn't wanna die without me,

06:21.958 --> 06:23.460
but I'm not always gonna be around.

06:23.485 --> 06:26.296
I mean, this baby
will arrive eventually,

06:26.321 --> 06:28.575
and you need to be able
to do this on your own.

06:29.673 --> 06:31.083
So, might as well start now.

06:31.492 --> 06:34.121
Are you sure he's up for the next one?

06:34.773 --> 06:35.798
Of course I am.

06:36.290 --> 06:38.808
And I have excellent bedside manner.

06:39.580 --> 06:41.678
But just out of curiosity,
who might that be?

06:41.897 --> 06:42.903
It's D-day.

06:43.432 --> 06:45.032
_

06:47.853 --> 06:51.789
And the light outside
my window shines directly

06:51.814 --> 06:53.446
- in my eyes all night long.
- Donna?

06:53.471 --> 06:55.544
Is that on purpose? To keep me awake?

06:55.569 --> 06:57.370
- Donna?
- And this mattress...

06:57.395 --> 06:59.847
Ugh, it's like a rock wrapped in cement.

07:00.855 --> 07:03.650
- No wonder I have bedsores.
- Oh, my God!

07:03.675 --> 07:06.236
As we've discussed,
those are edema caused

07:06.261 --> 07:08.366
by fluids pooling into your legs.

07:09.106 --> 07:11.803
Your heart is no longer pumping
blood to your extremities.

07:11.828 --> 07:12.862
One time...

07:14.281 --> 07:16.490
I was stranded at O'Hare overnight.

07:17.007 --> 07:18.656
All the chairs were taken.

07:18.681 --> 07:21.098
Every inch of carpet, too.

07:21.793 --> 07:24.387
I had to sleep on the tile floor.

07:24.786 --> 07:28.058
And it still was softer than this bed.

07:28.092 --> 07:30.860
Donna, we're not here from
the complaints department.

07:30.885 --> 07:31.985
This is about your...

07:33.205 --> 07:34.298
your time.

07:36.327 --> 07:37.395
It's your turn.

07:40.669 --> 07:43.840
- Oh.
- So... is there anything

07:43.865 --> 07:45.742
special you'd like
for your final moments?

07:46.603 --> 07:48.545
Some clean sheets'd be nice,

07:48.689 --> 07:51.250
- if it's not too much to ask.
- We wash the sheets every day!

07:51.275 --> 07:53.783
We'll take care of it.
And in the meantime,

07:53.808 --> 07:56.744
if there's anything else,
let us know. Okay?

08:10.206 --> 08:12.073
That's your "excellent bedside manner"?

08:12.098 --> 08:14.599
- She's a witch.
- She's our patient.

08:14.624 --> 08:17.908
Not for long. Should be taking care
of that problem momentarily.

08:19.147 --> 08:20.543
You're welcome.

08:20.749 --> 08:22.946
_

08:24.521 --> 08:27.489
Are we sure if it's a
girl? All this pink...

08:28.022 --> 08:29.353
Well, boys can wear pink.

08:30.133 --> 08:31.836
Yeah, it's just confusing.

08:32.500 --> 08:34.467
But I guess this whole
thing's confusing anyway.

08:34.711 --> 08:36.171
- What do you mean?
- Life.

08:37.706 --> 08:39.573
I am starting to wonder
what the point is.

08:39.597 --> 08:41.207
Can you stop going all Nietzsche on me

08:41.232 --> 08:42.357
and help me sort this stuff?

08:42.433 --> 08:43.967
That's your punishment, remember?

08:44.186 --> 08:45.686
_

08:48.226 --> 08:50.494
What? Does grounded mean
you can't check your phone?

08:50.930 --> 08:52.485
_

08:54.812 --> 08:56.112
- Hey, don't!
- "Help me, Jess.

08:56.137 --> 08:59.172
I'm begging you". This
is a long text message.

09:01.944 --> 09:03.686
- Oh, shit.
- What's going on?

09:03.721 --> 09:06.080
Nothing. I just, I need to, um,

09:06.105 --> 09:07.775
I just need to talk to Naomi.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.561
What do I tell Mom if
she asks where you are?

09:10.017 --> 09:11.865
Tell her I went to the library.

09:11.890 --> 09:13.323
First, you're burning cars.

09:13.348 --> 09:15.069
Now, you're sneaking
out and lying about it?

09:15.300 --> 09:17.267
You're turning into a bad influence.

09:17.301 --> 09:19.936
Well, there's no point
to it all anyways, right?

09:25.841 --> 09:26.875
Phil?

09:29.811 --> 09:31.583
Are you hungry? Can I get you anything?

09:32.521 --> 09:35.118
I'm fine, thanks.

09:36.948 --> 09:38.788
How about I bring you a cup of tea?

09:39.276 --> 09:40.752
Milk, two sugars, right?

09:42.921 --> 09:44.023
Appreciate it.

09:50.108 --> 09:51.240
Hey, Des!

09:51.265 --> 09:53.732
How about some five-card draw
now that my dance partner's gone?

09:53.756 --> 09:55.038
- Excuse me?
- Robert.

09:55.365 --> 09:56.812
He must've taken 90 bucks from me.

09:56.837 --> 09:58.357
I can't leave this planet in the hole.

09:58.749 --> 10:00.543
Sorry. Duty calls.

10:00.578 --> 10:01.679
Maybe later.

10:05.017 --> 10:07.026
You can't keep avoiding
her forever, you know.

10:07.051 --> 10:10.407
I'm not. I'm just getting
my priorities straight.

10:10.649 --> 10:13.056
Work, imminent patients, you.

10:13.352 --> 10:15.235
How are you feeling, anyway?
How's the little mango?

10:15.259 --> 10:17.660
Oh, probably the size of a melon now.

10:17.685 --> 10:19.752
I'll find out today.
I've got an ultrasound.

10:20.547 --> 10:21.798
You going alone?

10:23.956 --> 10:27.298
Well... while I have zero interest

10:27.323 --> 10:30.392
in helping you raise a baby,
as your best friend

10:30.417 --> 10:32.185
and business partner, I am...

10:32.744 --> 10:34.477
available to accompany you.

10:34.502 --> 10:37.085
Actually, you're not. You'll
be with Donna. Remember?

10:37.874 --> 10:39.943
And I'll be fine.

10:39.968 --> 10:41.687
Here. It's for Phil.

10:45.720 --> 10:48.486
Annie. You said you didn't do it.

10:48.511 --> 10:49.837
What are you talking about.

10:49.862 --> 10:52.364
You saw Dorothy Rosemond
last week, right?

10:53.071 --> 10:55.098
80 years old, pancreatic cancer.

10:55.123 --> 10:57.691
- Yeah. What about her?
- Did you kill her?

10:58.009 --> 11:00.803
What? No! She said she didn't wanna die.

11:00.838 --> 11:02.190
Yeah, well, she's dead.

11:03.070 --> 11:04.171
I just found out.

11:11.738 --> 11:13.230
I'm so glad you called.

11:14.675 --> 11:17.163
I didn't feel right about
how we left things either.

11:22.293 --> 11:25.795
- Did you kill Dorothy?
- I'm sorry?

11:25.829 --> 11:26.936
You heard me.

11:30.404 --> 11:33.866
I've never been here before.
Is this your regular?

11:33.891 --> 11:35.772
- What should I order?
- I asked you a question.

11:38.537 --> 11:40.866
Don't worry. It was very peaceful.

11:43.921 --> 11:46.816
- How did you do it?
- Insulin.

11:48.302 --> 11:50.411
But we can use Pento on our next patient

11:50.436 --> 11:51.904
if you're willing to share.

11:54.177 --> 11:55.925
But Dorothy didn't wanna die!

11:56.312 --> 11:57.910
She told us that!

11:57.935 --> 11:59.508
She did want to die.

12:00.281 --> 12:01.609
She just got cold feet.

12:02.398 --> 12:03.800
They do that sometimes.

12:05.008 --> 12:07.003
- "They"?
- That's what we do.

12:07.609 --> 12:09.852
We identify people who are in pain,

12:10.407 --> 12:12.375
- and help them out of it.
- Stop saying "we".

12:12.409 --> 12:13.734
There is no we.

12:16.704 --> 12:17.705
Okay...

12:20.906 --> 12:23.238
I'm sensing some judgment here.

12:24.091 --> 12:25.286
I don't understand.

12:26.156 --> 12:28.331
You called me. I... thought
you changed your mind,

12:28.356 --> 12:30.791
wanted to work together. We're the same.

12:30.956 --> 12:33.065
I'm nothing like you.

12:48.116 --> 12:49.623
And you're sure it was Francis?

12:49.648 --> 12:51.451
Annie, she told me she did it.

12:51.476 --> 12:53.237
There's no way that
Dorothy changed her mind?

12:54.234 --> 12:56.508
Look, I'm just trying to
rule out the possibility.

12:56.533 --> 12:58.154
Look, I know when people are ready.

12:58.179 --> 13:01.019
Dorothy wasn't. There's no way
she would've consented.

13:06.100 --> 13:08.025
I think she did Gail too.

13:08.482 --> 13:09.537
What?

13:10.717 --> 13:12.208
But I thought that you helped Gail...

13:12.233 --> 13:15.215
I gave Gail Pento because
she was dying and in agony.

13:15.240 --> 13:17.868
I thought it was a failed
suicide attempt with insulin.

13:18.553 --> 13:20.939
Insulin, Annie! That's how she does it!

13:20.964 --> 13:23.713
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- She's killing people

13:23.738 --> 13:25.152
who aren't ready to die.

13:25.177 --> 13:28.024
She thinks she's some
kind of angel of mercy.

13:28.049 --> 13:29.914
You think that she's done this before?

13:29.948 --> 13:32.583
Honestly, I don't know what
this woman is capable of.

13:34.093 --> 13:35.161
Okay.

13:36.834 --> 13:39.258
We go down to the police station
and we tell them the story.

13:39.727 --> 13:44.943
Where... you, former homicide
suspect Dr. Mary Harris,

13:46.211 --> 13:48.598
were at Gail's death
and Dorothy's house.

13:48.623 --> 13:50.001
Obviously not.

13:50.035 --> 13:53.570
Okay, then can we just... I don't know.

13:55.480 --> 13:58.482
- Leave it?
- Annie?

13:59.330 --> 14:01.673
Leave that woman out here in the world,

14:01.698 --> 14:03.981
killing people who don't wanna die?

14:06.023 --> 14:07.990
We have to stop her!

14:15.026 --> 14:16.894
Naomi?

14:17.987 --> 14:19.020
Are you here?

14:19.845 --> 14:22.011
♪ How strange these streets feel ♪

14:22.036 --> 14:23.944
♪ When you're all alone ♪

14:24.583 --> 14:25.770
♪ Each... ♪

14:26.538 --> 14:27.572
Naomi.

14:29.858 --> 14:31.819
Naomi, you can't just
send me a novel of a text

14:31.844 --> 14:33.020
and pretend to be sleeping.

14:34.537 --> 14:35.672
Seriously?

14:36.273 --> 14:38.517
I covered for you with the
cops. I came here today,

14:38.542 --> 14:41.310
even though I'm grounded
for the fire you started,

14:41.407 --> 14:43.509
and you can't even be
bothered to just talk...

14:44.620 --> 14:46.460
- Oh, my God.
- Jess...

14:46.485 --> 14:48.120
What? Whoa. What happened?

14:52.188 --> 14:53.632
- What did you do?!
- I don't know.

14:53.657 --> 14:57.847
Oh, okay. Um, just, uh, don't move.

14:57.872 --> 15:00.090
Okay? No, no, no, no, no. No. It's okay.

15:00.115 --> 15:01.816
We're gonna get you cleaned up. It's okay.

15:02.607 --> 15:04.876
Okay.

15:13.894 --> 15:15.520
Ellen, I've heard her.

15:15.871 --> 15:17.675
She says questionable...

15:17.894 --> 15:19.892
even unnerving things to the patients.

15:21.084 --> 15:22.737
Especially terminal ones.

15:23.543 --> 15:26.570
Francis, the woman who literally
whistles while she works?

15:26.595 --> 15:29.845
I know, but there's
something... off about her.

15:30.141 --> 15:32.025
Have you recorded any
of these incidents?

15:32.050 --> 15:33.462
Do you have them in your files?

15:36.716 --> 15:38.302
I think she's stealing drugs.

15:40.513 --> 15:42.147
Insulin, possibly.

15:42.181 --> 15:44.834
- That's a very serious allegation.
- Ellen, you know me.

15:44.859 --> 15:46.521
I keep my head down. I do the work,

15:46.546 --> 15:47.813
and I don't do drama.

15:49.357 --> 15:50.915
But this is serious.

15:53.513 --> 15:55.160
I wouldn't be here otherwise.

16:08.346 --> 16:11.815
Unbelievable.

16:11.840 --> 16:15.180
What now? Did the cork pop too loudly?

16:15.214 --> 16:17.010
Is the champagne too bubbly for you?

16:17.035 --> 16:20.704
I'm sober. 14 years now.

16:25.124 --> 16:27.411
Oh, I... don't let me throw you off.

16:27.918 --> 16:29.570
I'll be gone in a minute anyway.

16:29.595 --> 16:32.160
No, I... I get it.

16:32.980 --> 16:34.119
I'm sober too.

16:34.144 --> 16:36.801
Well, actually, that makes some sense.

16:36.836 --> 16:38.686
Oh, yeah? How's that?

16:38.711 --> 16:40.531
I thought that giving up drinking would

16:40.556 --> 16:42.476
make me less of an asshole.

16:43.390 --> 16:44.898
But it turns out, it didn't.

16:45.601 --> 16:47.879
Same goes with you, I take it.

16:48.085 --> 16:50.669
- Charmer, right to the end.
- Hmph!

17:01.311 --> 17:02.412
We're all set.

17:05.064 --> 17:06.898
Any last insults?

17:25.976 --> 17:27.551
What do you think happens?

17:29.818 --> 17:30.923
When you drink it?

17:31.247 --> 17:32.282
No!

17:34.336 --> 17:35.437
After.

17:37.418 --> 17:38.519
Oh.

17:39.865 --> 17:43.168
Ah... well, I've heard it

17:43.193 --> 17:46.438
described as settling into a warm bath.

17:48.341 --> 17:50.442
The sunset fading into the horizon.

17:53.084 --> 17:54.118
Donna...

17:55.047 --> 17:57.087
if you're not ready, we
don't have to do this today.

17:59.039 --> 18:00.107
It's funny...

18:01.321 --> 18:04.656
when I was drinking, I
was surrounded by people.

18:04.939 --> 18:08.142
I had more friends than
I knew what to do with.

18:09.917 --> 18:12.352
But then, I got sober.

18:14.502 --> 18:15.876
And they all disappeared,

18:17.041 --> 18:19.004
because I wasn't much fun anymore.

18:19.986 --> 18:23.642
So, the drunks moved on.

18:24.176 --> 18:25.697
What about your sister?

18:26.586 --> 18:29.047
The one in... Chicago?

18:29.714 --> 18:31.189
You do listen.

18:36.379 --> 18:37.518
She had had enough.

18:38.591 --> 18:40.069
- Does she even know...
- No.

18:57.476 --> 18:58.678
I'm ready now.

19:06.309 --> 19:08.002
Will you hold my hand?

19:09.003 --> 19:10.198
Yeah, of course.

19:49.734 --> 19:50.769
Bye, Des.

21:26.272 --> 21:27.483
How'd it go with Donna?

21:28.756 --> 21:31.243
Fine. Great, actually.

21:31.945 --> 21:34.496
Is that why you're wandering
around in the freezing cold?

21:35.406 --> 21:38.617
It's called getting some fresh air,
Lucy, and it's very normal.

21:41.054 --> 21:42.354
What are you doing?

21:42.379 --> 21:45.014
It's called marijuana. Also very normal.

21:45.843 --> 21:46.859
Use it for the pain.

21:46.893 --> 21:49.862
- Oh, please.
- "Please" what? You want some?

21:50.692 --> 21:52.364
- You look like you could use it.
- No.

21:52.575 --> 21:56.301
No, I do not. My God,
you're such a brat.

21:57.407 --> 21:58.610
Anyway, it's your life.

21:59.138 --> 22:00.806
What's left of it. You do you.

22:00.840 --> 22:02.408
Man, why are you being such a jerk?

22:03.142 --> 22:05.111
What the hell do you
want from me exactly, huh?

22:06.090 --> 22:07.813
I'm not your dance partner.

22:08.215 --> 22:11.149
I'm not your lover. This is a hospice.

22:11.458 --> 22:13.619
And it's-it's full of
people who are dying.

22:14.454 --> 22:16.176
There's no happy
endings here, my friend.

22:16.201 --> 22:18.067
It's not a God damn romantic comedy.

22:19.840 --> 22:23.896
Well, good. It's too bad
Donna's no longer with us.

22:23.921 --> 22:26.122
You guys would've been perfect together.

22:27.967 --> 22:30.530
Two miserable peas in
a shitty little pod.

22:41.447 --> 22:43.093
Okay. We have to go to the hospital.

22:43.118 --> 22:45.008
- It won't stop bleeding.
- No! Jess, no. We can't.

22:45.032 --> 22:46.132
They're just gonna tell my mom.

22:46.156 --> 22:48.327
So? She needs to know what's going on.

22:48.352 --> 22:51.043
My mom does not like your mom,
Jess. She's not gonna care.

22:51.068 --> 22:52.888
She's just gonna be mad at
me for making her come home

22:52.912 --> 22:55.762
- from Montreal to deal with me.
- She's not gonna be mad.

22:56.440 --> 22:59.344
Hey. Naomi, you need stitches.

22:59.369 --> 23:01.033
No. No. Don't. No.

23:01.916 --> 23:03.201
You know what?

23:05.405 --> 23:07.992
You do it. You wanna be a doctor, right?

23:08.017 --> 23:09.454
You wanna be a doctor? Stitch up my arm.

23:09.478 --> 23:10.552
This'll be good practice.

23:10.577 --> 23:12.141
- I don't know how to do that.
- Jess...

23:15.857 --> 23:17.739
Please, don't tell my mom.

23:18.205 --> 23:20.241
Just please, don't make
me go to the hospital.

23:28.498 --> 23:30.896
... enter the skin at 90 degrees,

23:30.930 --> 23:32.427
and then go back

23:32.452 --> 23:34.420
a few millimetres at the end.

23:34.767 --> 23:37.556
- I don't know if this is right.
- I believe in you.

23:39.329 --> 23:40.973
I'm sorry!

23:41.007 --> 23:42.275
I'm just kidding.

23:55.621 --> 23:56.989
It actually feels kind of good.

23:58.100 --> 23:59.186
It doesn't hurt?

24:01.150 --> 24:02.251
No, it does.

24:05.863 --> 24:07.666
Seriously, how did this happen?

24:07.700 --> 24:09.868
It was pretty stupid.

24:11.649 --> 24:13.255
I was just looking for this record.

24:14.763 --> 24:16.842
My mom keeps all of her
old vinyl under the bed.

24:16.876 --> 24:18.223
It's like an old...

24:18.732 --> 24:20.582
... bed frame, so I
guess I must've just...

24:23.057 --> 24:25.567
... scratched on a nail or
something and didn't notice.

24:31.098 --> 24:33.634
I used to play this record
over and over again

24:33.659 --> 24:35.062
when my parents were fighting.

24:37.343 --> 24:38.531

25:44.230 --> 25:45.965
And you were right. I didn't tell you...

25:47.061 --> 25:50.598
about the pregnancy because
I was protecting myself.

25:52.520 --> 25:53.572
I was...

25:55.827 --> 25:56.909
scared.

25:58.006 --> 25:59.081
Of me?

25:59.106 --> 26:00.522
Of how you would react.

26:01.819 --> 26:04.684
Ben, you know what I do.

26:04.709 --> 26:06.959
What if you thought I
would be an unfit mother?

26:06.984 --> 26:09.989
You could've... I don't
know, turned me in.

26:10.623 --> 26:13.546
- Or taken away the baby.
- I never would have done that.

26:14.160 --> 26:15.413
I couldn't be sure.

26:18.615 --> 26:21.317
But it was unfair to you,

26:21.342 --> 26:22.376
and I-I'm...

26:23.563 --> 26:24.681
very sorry.

26:30.689 --> 26:31.719
Okay.

26:32.678 --> 26:33.736
Okay?

26:35.835 --> 26:39.094
So, if you wanna be a
part of this baby's life,

26:39.119 --> 26:41.219
you can. But if you don't, that's...

26:41.254 --> 26:43.789
That's fine too.

26:44.750 --> 26:46.513
It's entirely your decision.

26:49.595 --> 26:51.084
What would that look like?

26:52.265 --> 26:53.332
If I...

26:54.000 --> 26:55.524
If I wanted to be a part of it?

27:02.108 --> 27:03.663
You've got a sneaky one here.

27:05.452 --> 27:07.245
Um, what does that mean?

27:07.421 --> 27:09.648
The baby's curled up,
sleeping at the back.

27:10.412 --> 27:13.493
It's just far enough that
I can't get the images I need.

27:14.546 --> 27:16.655
- I can reschedule.
- I've got time.

27:17.521 --> 27:19.601
Why don't you and your
husband walk around for a bit?

27:19.625 --> 27:20.677
Come back in 10.

27:26.732 --> 27:28.867
A little sugar might make her dance.

27:31.637 --> 27:35.207
- "Her"?
- Oh, sorry. Force of habit.

27:35.241 --> 27:37.209
I don't actually know the sex yet.

27:38.881 --> 27:40.115
Any preference?

27:41.328 --> 27:44.672
Not really. I know what
to expect with girls,

27:44.697 --> 27:46.078
but a boy might be fun.

27:49.572 --> 27:51.353
Did you ever want kids?

27:52.056 --> 27:54.439
Nah. I guess I never
really felt settled enough,

27:54.464 --> 27:57.460
moving around a lot.
Time went on and I just,

27:57.485 --> 27:58.837
I figured I missed my shot.

27:59.550 --> 28:01.701
I got pregnant with Jess in med school.

28:01.977 --> 28:03.649
That's how I ended up with her dad.

28:04.118 --> 28:07.105
- Where's he in all this?
- He moved for work.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.074
He's gonna take the girls in the summer.

28:09.108 --> 28:10.443
Hm.

28:12.978 --> 28:15.608
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

28:17.166 --> 28:18.591
Why aren't you a cop anymore?

28:20.185 --> 28:21.786
I got fired four months ago.

28:23.569 --> 28:24.817
Because of me?

28:26.483 --> 28:28.973
Conduct... unbecoming.

28:29.428 --> 28:30.863
Breach of trust. Just...

28:31.661 --> 28:33.699
generally screwing a
whole lot of shit up.

28:35.649 --> 28:37.251
That wasn't even the worst part of it.

28:38.889 --> 28:40.154
What do you mean?

28:42.875 --> 28:45.310
That night that I let
you go at the car wash?

28:45.940 --> 28:47.190
I almost died.

28:47.956 --> 28:50.248
Somehow, I managed to call 911.

28:50.283 --> 28:52.184
The paramedics found me unconscious.

28:53.021 --> 28:54.978
They took me to the hospital and, uh...

28:55.447 --> 28:57.156
- they pumped my stomach.
- What?!

28:57.773 --> 29:00.108
- I woke up two days later.
- Did they test you?

29:00.133 --> 29:02.002
They figured it was
alcohol poisoning, but...

29:02.913 --> 29:05.805
I know it wasn't the booze,
Mary. It was Pento.

29:07.645 --> 29:08.660
Olivia.

29:08.864 --> 29:11.364
- Is that possible?
- Yeah, it's possible.

29:15.041 --> 29:17.175
Wait. You know it wasn't me, right?

29:17.443 --> 29:19.577
I had nothing to do with it.
You know that.

29:19.612 --> 29:21.638
Ben!

29:21.663 --> 29:23.832
Yeah, I know. I know.

29:30.034 --> 29:31.935
- You ready?
- Yeah.

29:35.127 --> 29:37.756
There we go.

29:39.647 --> 29:40.761
Take a look.

29:45.192 --> 29:46.493
Would you like to know the sex?

29:49.709 --> 29:50.944
I think we would.

29:55.302 --> 29:57.315
It's... a boy.

29:58.167 --> 29:59.354
Congratulations.

30:07.819 --> 30:09.358
Do you need anything else?

30:09.383 --> 30:11.730
I think I can score a yogurt tube
from the vending machine.

30:13.725 --> 30:15.367
I mean, if that's okay.

30:18.827 --> 30:20.086
I'd say you've earned a treat.

30:22.396 --> 30:23.530
Be right back.

30:28.307 --> 30:29.894
You look like you're feeling better.

30:29.949 --> 30:31.816
I won't be climbing silk anytime soon,

30:31.851 --> 30:34.085
but the doctor thinks
I'll be able to walk again.

30:34.120 --> 30:35.240
That's amazing.

30:36.614 --> 30:38.037
That's amazing news.

30:39.209 --> 30:40.809
You know you have people to help, right?

30:41.491 --> 30:43.647
- Your family, Bronwyn...
- Did you tell her

30:44.196 --> 30:46.231
- what I said before?
- No.

30:47.122 --> 30:48.222
No, of course not.

30:49.408 --> 30:51.611
I would hate if she knew
that I'd consider...

30:52.772 --> 30:56.007
- giving up.
- She's been great.

30:56.388 --> 30:58.309
She hasn't left the hospital
since you got here.

30:59.420 --> 31:01.967
It is so important to have
people in your life

31:01.992 --> 31:03.310
who will stand by you.

31:04.400 --> 31:05.652
Isn't that right, Annie?

31:06.821 --> 31:07.860
Of course.

31:10.181 --> 31:11.982
I'll check on you later, okay?

31:20.597 --> 31:23.394
Well, this is the fastest
I've seen you move

31:23.419 --> 31:26.111
since I asked you to contribute
to Ruth's retirement gift.

31:26.136 --> 31:28.721
Yeah, sorry. I've got a guy
who's pulling out his IV

31:28.746 --> 31:30.276
in his sleep that I've gotta check on.

31:31.276 --> 31:33.112
I think we have a friend in common...

31:34.246 --> 31:36.471
- Dr. Mary Harris.
- Why do you think that?

31:36.496 --> 31:39.784
Well, when Ellen told me the
things you said about me today,

31:39.819 --> 31:42.554
I figured Mary must be the
one whispering in your ear.

31:43.380 --> 31:44.961
I don't know what you're talking about.

31:45.998 --> 31:48.359
And if you're having trouble
with the administration,

31:48.394 --> 31:49.794
you should speak to your union rep.

31:49.829 --> 31:50.897
I understand.

31:52.145 --> 31:54.446
I struggle with my
obligation to report too.

31:56.902 --> 32:00.751
Like if I suspect a nurse is feeding
terminal patients to a killer.

32:02.853 --> 32:04.055
Should I say something?

32:07.281 --> 32:10.582
Anyway, I'll let you get back
to that patient with the IV.

32:33.447 --> 32:35.451
- Who is it?
- It's Des.

32:36.336 --> 32:39.138
- I'm sleeping.
- Come on, Lucy. Open up.

32:39.163 --> 32:40.178
Please.

32:41.327 --> 32:43.296
You realize I have a master key, right?

32:43.800 --> 32:47.111
And purely for safety's sake,
but I will use it if I have to.

32:48.783 --> 32:51.361
- Special delivery.
- For me?

32:51.386 --> 32:54.054
Don't be too flattered. I'd do
the same for any of my patients.

32:58.983 --> 33:01.753
XXXtreme cheese.

33:01.787 --> 33:04.421
Three X's. It's a bit excessive.

33:05.393 --> 33:07.186
And an excellent Bordeaux.

33:07.211 --> 33:10.100
My God, I used to swim in this stuff!

33:11.464 --> 33:12.805
But it's all yours now.

33:13.673 --> 33:17.610
And... Tadam!

33:17.770 --> 33:19.711
- Dogs?
- In sunglasses.

33:21.069 --> 33:22.469
How about some 5-card draw?

33:23.085 --> 33:25.786
Fine. I wasn't sleeping anyway.

33:26.976 --> 33:28.179
What do we play for?

33:29.338 --> 33:30.573
Uh...

33:32.870 --> 33:34.549
Honor, glory...

33:34.574 --> 33:36.640
The thrill of the win?

33:36.665 --> 33:37.733
Nah...

33:38.724 --> 33:42.060
Chips are far more satisfying
than any of those things.

34:03.681 --> 34:04.821
Busted.

34:06.173 --> 34:08.196
Did mom ask about me?
She's super pissed?

34:08.221 --> 34:11.790
No, you got lucky. She's
been a little distracted.

34:11.815 --> 34:12.955
What do you mean?

34:17.697 --> 34:18.766
Hey.

34:21.853 --> 34:23.264
Jess, this is Ben.

34:23.295 --> 34:26.098
- Mom's friend.
- Hi.

34:26.123 --> 34:28.257
- Hey.
- Are you joining us?

34:28.882 --> 34:30.926
What? Oh... yeah.

34:31.757 --> 34:32.844
Yeah.

34:35.043 --> 34:36.246
So...

34:36.282 --> 34:38.315
Ben, do you live close by?

34:38.600 --> 34:40.702
Uh... Sure, yeah. Close enough.

34:41.083 --> 34:44.483
- Close enough for what?
- Uh...

34:44.507 --> 34:47.295
Close enough to pop over for dinner.

34:47.320 --> 34:49.188
And how do you know my mom?

34:49.395 --> 34:51.355
Oh, Ben used to be a detective.

34:51.563 --> 34:53.409
- Um-hum.
- And sometimes,

34:53.435 --> 34:55.701
police and doctors
have to work together.

34:55.726 --> 34:58.295
- "Used to be"?
- Yes. Not anymore.

34:58.801 --> 35:01.084
- Did you get fired?
- Yeah.

35:01.373 --> 35:04.275
- How come?
- Uh...

35:04.626 --> 35:07.243
Well, I was working this case,

35:07.268 --> 35:09.769
and then I got a little too close to it.

35:10.399 --> 35:12.820
"Whoever fights
monsters should see to it

35:12.845 --> 35:15.280
that in the process, he
does not become a monster".

35:16.375 --> 35:17.689
Jesus, Cam!

35:18.024 --> 35:19.945
You're the one who
told me about Nietzsche.

35:20.718 --> 35:22.527
So are you the father of my mom's baby?

35:22.883 --> 35:25.864
Cambie. It's none of our business.

35:25.898 --> 35:27.649
It's a little of our business.

35:27.674 --> 35:29.408
That's enough interrogating.

35:30.300 --> 35:32.001
We'll talk about this later.

35:37.209 --> 35:39.011
You'd make a good detective.

35:47.860 --> 35:50.228
Ugh... Unlucky.

35:51.091 --> 35:52.157
Should we go again?

35:53.771 --> 35:56.589
Are you letting me win or are you
just not very good at this?

35:56.614 --> 35:57.674
The latter.

36:04.003 --> 36:06.326
I wanted to apologize for earlier.

36:07.592 --> 36:09.006
I was a miserable jerk,

36:09.031 --> 36:11.699
- as you so eloquently put it.
- Yeah.

36:13.411 --> 36:14.913
I wasn't always, you know.

36:14.947 --> 36:16.536
- No?
- No...

36:17.583 --> 36:21.186
No, back when I was a surgeon,
I was downright agreeable.

36:23.359 --> 36:26.561
Granted, I was high most of the time.

36:28.525 --> 36:29.743
Mary took me in.

36:29.768 --> 36:33.625
She gave me a chance to do
something good in the world.

36:35.912 --> 36:36.947
But I just...

36:38.431 --> 36:40.979
I thought it would be easier somehow.

36:44.193 --> 36:45.664
This was my dream.

36:46.645 --> 36:49.318
A safe place where we can do what we do,

36:49.726 --> 36:51.279
without fear, without judgement.

36:51.808 --> 36:54.662
Oh, my God. You made a
vision board, didn't you?

36:56.241 --> 36:57.264
No.

36:57.289 --> 36:58.564
Whatever.

37:04.272 --> 37:06.350
What I didn't anticipate...

37:07.663 --> 37:08.780
were the people.

37:10.374 --> 37:11.479
The messy...

37:12.177 --> 37:13.837
lovely people

37:13.862 --> 37:15.435
that I'd be forced to get to know.

37:17.185 --> 37:18.474
Mary knew.

37:19.834 --> 37:22.547
We've done dozens of deaths together.

37:22.752 --> 37:24.389
She always handles the hot pot.

37:24.824 --> 37:26.392
She always makes it look so easy.

37:28.644 --> 37:32.147
But standing there today,

37:33.638 --> 37:34.667
alone...

37:35.956 --> 37:37.462
Donna, you know.

37:37.901 --> 37:39.654
Fitch, I couldn't wait for her to go.

37:43.232 --> 37:44.646
And I was holding her hand...

37:48.800 --> 37:51.720
... literally feeling the
life drain from her body.

37:52.752 --> 37:56.242
I don't know, it's like
something shifted in me.

38:01.640 --> 38:04.789
So, as it turns out,

38:05.500 --> 38:08.711
even when getting rid of
an old windbag like Donna...

38:11.181 --> 38:13.023
Killing's hard.

38:16.216 --> 38:18.265
Any human connection is hard.

38:20.971 --> 38:22.143
But you know what's harder?

38:22.784 --> 38:23.800
What?

38:26.996 --> 38:28.011
Dying.

38:32.550 --> 38:35.386
Leah said, "Enough with the
green tea". She wants a coffee.

38:35.421 --> 38:37.440
- Is that all right?
- It's fine by me.

38:37.465 --> 38:40.024
I'll get a decaf. You guys
should get some sleep.

38:55.188 --> 38:57.942
_

38:57.967 --> 38:59.332
_

39:41.665 --> 39:42.970
She's doing amazing.

39:44.273 --> 39:47.008
Yeah, the doctor said she can
start seeing people tomorrow.

39:58.169 --> 40:00.171
Code blue, ICU, bed 11.

40:12.312 --> 40:13.515
Get the curtains.

40:30.377 --> 40:31.845
You don't have to do that.

40:32.518 --> 40:34.775
Ah, it's okay. I'm used to it, you know.

40:34.972 --> 40:36.837
No dishwasher in the trailer.

40:37.813 --> 40:39.491
I'll go check on the girls.

40:39.525 --> 40:40.626
Yeah.

40:40.992 --> 40:44.761
You know, I like them. Cambie, she's...

40:45.054 --> 40:47.212
- she's got a lot of questions.
- Yeah.

40:48.106 --> 40:49.207
But you held your own.

41:00.330 --> 41:01.690
Can I talk to you for a minute?

41:01.715 --> 41:02.783
Um-hum.

41:03.232 --> 41:04.700
Where were you when I got home?

41:06.521 --> 41:09.670
I went to the library to do
some reading for a project.

41:10.880 --> 41:13.158
Some medical journals
that aren't online.

41:13.754 --> 41:15.634
Still thinking about being a doctor?

41:17.283 --> 41:18.541
Yeah, maybe.

41:21.332 --> 41:23.040
What made you want to be a doctor?

41:23.469 --> 41:24.743
I wanted to help people.

41:24.768 --> 41:26.608
Because of what you went
through with your mom?

41:32.041 --> 41:33.128
I think so.

41:35.221 --> 41:37.547
Our life felt pretty out of control

41:37.572 --> 41:39.941
a lot of the time, so
I guess I liked the idea

41:39.966 --> 41:43.802
of doing something that made
the world feel less chaotic.

41:44.423 --> 41:47.510
How did you know that your mom
was depressed and not just...

41:48.522 --> 41:50.065
like sad or something?

41:50.090 --> 41:52.926
Sometimes, it can be as bad as cancer.

41:54.092 --> 41:56.354
And I guess for some people like my mom,

41:57.244 --> 41:59.296
it's pretty hard to come back from.

42:05.711 --> 42:07.271
Don't stay up too late, okay?

42:15.178 --> 42:16.270
What happened?

42:16.295 --> 42:17.814
Francis killed another patient.

42:18.459 --> 42:19.483
What?

42:24.647 --> 42:26.209
It wasn't even a terminal case.

42:26.234 --> 42:28.369
It was this young woman. We... I mean,

42:28.394 --> 42:31.795
- she was gonna be fine.
- How did she do it?

42:31.820 --> 42:33.909
Morphine. With a little twist.

42:33.934 --> 42:36.202
- What do you mean?
- She punched in my code, Mary!

42:36.227 --> 42:37.595
I just got suspended!

42:37.629 --> 42:39.731
Look, she knew that I went to Ellen

42:39.756 --> 42:41.407
and she knew that I spoke to you!

42:41.878 --> 42:45.419
Okay. Okay. You can talk to Ellen again.

42:45.644 --> 42:47.413
Maybe this helps her case!

42:47.806 --> 42:49.517
She'll have to know. It's strange:

42:49.542 --> 42:52.077
the day you report Francis,
something like this happens!

42:52.102 --> 42:54.418
Well, I'm not even allowed
back until the investigation!

42:54.443 --> 42:56.584
- I'm probably gonna get fired!
- That won't happen.

42:56.609 --> 42:59.709
A 25 year-old girl
is dead because of us!

43:00.742 --> 43:02.384
This woman is a psychopath

43:02.409 --> 43:04.677
and you've already put me
in her line of fire once.

43:07.721 --> 43:08.798
Annie!

43:09.706 --> 43:11.324
- Annie!
- You're on your own, Mary.

43:25.054 --> 43:27.320
I think you'd better
tell me what's going on.
