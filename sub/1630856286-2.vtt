Is that a kid?

01:09.833 --> 01:12.583
Not just any kid, but Peter Quill.

01:12.666 --> 01:16.375
A son of Earth and the stars
whose pain and loss

01:16.458 --> 01:20.500
now threatens to destroy the very world
he once called home.

01:20.583 --> 01:23.583
And the entire universe along with it.

01:46.166 --> 01:47.916
It's more than a linear path.

01:52.750 --> 01:57.291
It's a prism of endless possibility,

01:59.708 --> 02:03.333
where a single choice
can branch out into infinite realities,

02:06.041 --> 02:08.958
creating alternate worlds
from the ones you know.

02:12.916 --> 02:14.166
I am the Watcher.

02:16.416 --> 02:19.500
I am your guide
through these vast new realities.

Follow me and ponder the question...

02:28.250 --> 02:29.666
"What if?"

02:35.875 --> 02:37.208
Six months earlier,

02:37.291 --> 02:42.083
the Ravagers were dispatched to abduct
Peter Quill from his home world.

02:43.791 --> 02:47.125
But young Quill's captor
couldn't bring himself to turn him over

02:47.208 --> 02:49.875
and chose to raise him as his own.

02:49.958 --> 02:53.000
At least, that's how the story often goes.

02:53.541 --> 02:57.916
But in this universe,
Yondu never had his change of heart.

02:58.291 --> 03:04.666
So he turned Peter over to his father,
the Celestial being known as Ego.

03:04.750 --> 03:07.833
(CHUCKLES) Well, you won't be
needing these anymore, Peter.

03:18.625 --> 03:23.000
a long-held dream to remake the universe
in his image.

And with his son now at his side,

he had all the power he needed
to bring it to fruition.

So he sent the Winter Soldier,

my mom says I'm a Star-Lord.

25:31.916 --> 25:33.500
EGO: Peter!

25:36.125 --> 25:37.750
(PETER SCREAMING)

25:39.958 --> 25:41.375
(EGO SCREAMS)

25:48.000 --> 25:50.750
(GRUNTS) Yes! (LAUGHS)

25:55.541 --> 25:56.541
Peter?

26:05.000 --> 26:06.833
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

26:10.125 --> 26:12.916
It's a recipe, Hank.
You're not splitting the atom.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.250
To be honest, splitting the atom
is a lot more intuitive.

26:16.333 --> 26:19.166
This American libation
is surprisingly delicious.

26:19.250 --> 26:20.708
What do you call it?

26:20.791 --> 26:22.250
Uh, light beer?

26:22.333 --> 26:24.500
-(CHUCKLES) How exotic. Another!
-(ALL LAUGHING)

26:24.583 --> 26:26.916
-And this little chicky's name is Goose.
-(CHUCKLES)

26:27.000 --> 26:28.875
I thought maybe you kids
might like to have her.

26:28.958 --> 26:31.458
-Thanks, but I'm more a dog guy.
-(CHUCKLES)

26:31.541 --> 26:34.708
-Peter, you don't say no to a free cat.
-(PETER CHUCKLES)

26:34.791 --> 26:38.125
-Hey, any word on Silent But Deadly?
-He's in the wind.

26:38.208 --> 26:41.000
-That mean we should lock our doors?
-I don't think so.

26:41.250 --> 26:43.500
Something broke through
that day in Missouri.

26:43.583 --> 26:45.416
The Winter Soldier may be out there,

26:45.500 --> 26:48.458
but I'm pretty sure Bucky Barnes
is out there with him.

26:52.666 --> 26:54.375
BILL: Oh, that's funny.
HOWARD: Yeah?

26:54.458 --> 26:55.958
HANK: In Asgard.
BILL: Yeah, exactly.

26:56.041 --> 26:57.416
T'CHAKA: Do you have similar pajamas?

26:57.500 --> 27:00.041
-Or do you go to sleep in your armor?
-THOR: And 53 gods is good.

27:00.125 --> 27:01.333
LAWSON: Okay, bucko.

27:01.416 --> 27:05.208
Many, many thanks to all of you
for this fine victory banquet.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.416
But I am afraid I must bid thee farewell.

27:07.500 --> 27:10.333
Come on. What about dessert?
Hank burnt a pie.

27:10.416 --> 27:13.375
The boy may have
destroyed Ego's corporeal form,

27:13.458 --> 27:15.250
but his planet still lives.

27:15.333 --> 27:19.708
And the universe will not know peace
until I have avenged the ones we've lost.

27:19.791 --> 27:22.416
So, what, Thunder brother? No invite?

27:22.500 --> 27:24.291
Perhaps you forgot, Goldilocks,

27:24.375 --> 27:27.583
we have sort of a team thing
going on here.

27:27.750 --> 27:30.458
Then I suggest you suit up, team.

27:40.500 --> 27:42.500
