00:07.807 --> 00:10.009
- What's up, guys? Welcome back
to "The Dude Perfect Show."

00:10.076 --> 00:12.812
Fun fact you may not know about
Cody is he's actually got

00:12.879 --> 00:14.280
a little bit
of a fear of heights.

00:14.347 --> 00:16.483
Cods, why don't you come on
and join us up here

00:16.549 --> 00:18.051
for the rest of the intro?

00:18.118 --> 00:20.987
- Yeah, I--most people
have a fear of heights, Ty.

00:21.054 --> 00:23.156
- You know what the best way
to deal with fear is?

00:23.223 --> 00:25.525
- Run away from it.
- No, you attack it head on.

00:25.592 --> 00:26.559
Right back here, big buddy.

00:26.626 --> 00:28.061
- There's no rail there.
- That's okay.

00:28.128 --> 00:30.563
- Why'd we take that off?
- Because if the rail was there,

00:30.630 --> 00:31.731
it wouldn't look like an intro.

00:31.798 --> 00:32.932
Cody's a little bit
scared of heights,

00:32.999 --> 00:34.300
as you may be able to tell.

00:34.367 --> 00:36.169
So we're gonna put him--come on,
keep it up here--through

00:36.236 --> 00:38.371
a few exercises to help him
overcome that fear.

00:38.438 --> 00:39.939
You committed?
Why do you keep backing up?

00:40.006 --> 00:41.374
- I'm committed.
- Come on up here.

00:41.441 --> 00:42.942
Alright, are you ready
to get started?

00:43.009 --> 00:44.544
- I guess, Ty.
- You guys ready?

00:44.611 --> 00:45.578
- I'm ready.
- Super ready.

00:45.645 --> 00:46.713

- Cods, this is the first step
in conquering your fear

01:11.738 --> 01:13.006
of heights, my friend.

01:13.072 --> 01:14.707
- Just get on the top of that?

- No.
We're gonna get on the top,

that's structurally sound?

does this thing go?

01:24.083 --> 01:26.186

could fall over the top,

put a harness on.

you fall like ten feet,

all the air out of you

I won't do anything

are gonna come into play.

15:33.832 --> 15:35.301
- That is--
- I wouldn't breathe that.

15:35.367 --> 15:37.369
- Yeah, I mean, you don't
know where that's been.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.405
- Yeah, well,
at your grandma's house.

15:39.471 --> 15:42.341
- Well, I'm just saying, if you
guys really wanna actively relax

15:42.408 --> 15:44.977
like me, you need to be
doing the stuff that I do.

15:45.044 --> 15:47.279
So let me sit you
through the course.

15:47.346 --> 15:49.181
We're gonna start out, we're
gonna move to station one.

15:49.248 --> 15:51.183
{\an8}You're gonna give off your shoes
into the basket,

15:51.250 --> 15:53.552
{\an8}put on some sweatpants,
grab a blanket and a pillow.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.754
{\an8}- Do you have to stay
on the couch the entire time?

15:55.821 --> 15:58.223
- That would be the goal, Ty.
You know, actively relaxing.

15:58.290 --> 16:00.025
We worked on that upstairs.

16:00.092 --> 16:01.927
Then we'll make our ways
down to the snack bar.

16:01.994 --> 16:04.830
{\an8}We'll grab some chips,
some salsa, and a drink.

16:04.897 --> 16:06.565
{\an8}Obviously no spillage, you know?

16:06.632 --> 16:08.033
{\an8}Then the ice cream station.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.268
{\an8}You're gonna
get some ice cream out

16:09.335 --> 16:10.436
{\an8}and put at least one topping.

16:10.502 --> 16:12.071
{\an8}You know what?
Let's just say two.

16:12.137 --> 16:14.039
{\an8}Haul to the TV, turn it on.

16:14.106 --> 16:15.641
Fastest time wins.

16:15.708 --> 16:16.975
Who's up first?
- I'll take it.

16:17.042 --> 16:19.011
- I like it, Cods. Hope on in.

16:19.078 --> 16:21.814
Here we go in three, two, one!

16:21.880 --> 16:23.916
Go!

16:23.982 --> 16:25.918
- Come on, come on.
- Alright, head over there.

16:25.984 --> 16:27.586
Make sure to get those shoes
in the basket.

16:27.653 --> 16:28.954
- Come on, Cods.

16:29.021 --> 16:30.622
- Alright, use your grabber
to get those shoes up

16:30.689 --> 16:32.991
if they're not in there.
- No way these are XL.

16:33.058 --> 16:35.094
{\an8}- Hey, take your time.
- Going.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.729
{\an8}- You're off the couch.

16:36.795 --> 16:38.130
{\an8}- Does he understand the game?

16:38.197 --> 16:39.665
{\an8}- I like the black plaid ones.

16:39.732 --> 16:42.868
{\an8}- Not the time to be picky.
- Alright, go, go!

16:42.935 --> 16:45.037
{\an8}Get to the snacks!

16:45.104 --> 16:46.572

16:48.707 --> 16:50.309

16:51.744 --> 16:52.778

16:53.946 --> 16:55.147
{\an8}- Oh gosh.

16:55.214 --> 16:57.416
{\an8}- Yes. Alright, two toppings.

16:57.483 --> 17:00.886
{\an8}Don't worry about it,
it's messy, but you're relaxed.

17:00.953 --> 17:02.554
Now turn the TV on.

17:02.621 --> 17:04.690
And time!

17:04.757 --> 17:06.992
{\an8}- How'd I do?
- Four forty-one.

17:07.059 --> 17:09.127
{\an8}- That was bad.
- That was a little too relaxed.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.096
- I had a great time.
- Who wants next?

17:11.163 --> 17:13.464
- I'll follow that up.
- I'm gonna give it to, Coby.

17:13.531 --> 17:15.834
Because you know what?
He took initiative.

17:15.901 --> 17:17.536
- Cods, get out of my chair.
- Yep.

17:17.603 --> 17:21.440
- Go! Oh, oh, no.

17:21.507 --> 17:22.674
There you go. Oh.

17:22.741 --> 17:24.276
Hey, shoes off in the basket.

17:24.343 --> 17:28.012
{\an8}- They gotta land in the basket.
- [buzzer sounds]

17:28.079 --> 17:29.448
{\an8}- He's relaxed, boys.

17:29.515 --> 17:30.783
{\an8}- He's grabbing
with his hands.

17:30.849 --> 17:32.551
{\an8}That was not fair.
- And he's off.

17:32.618 --> 17:33.652
{\an8}- And he's standing up.

17:33.719 --> 17:37.423
{\an8}- Hey, stay seated!

17:37.489 --> 17:39.425
{\an8}- And not gonna shut
the fridge, I see.

17:39.491 --> 17:41.427
{\an8}Don't care about
the environment, huh?

17:41.493 --> 17:44.363
{\an8}- I gotta say, you did
a lot of good swirls there.

17:44.430 --> 17:46.231
{\an8}Oh no.
- Uh, that looked like--

17:46.298 --> 17:50.636
{\an8}- Come on, come on.
- Oh, the TV's on.

17:50.702 --> 17:51.770
- Thank you.

17:51.837 --> 17:53.005
- What?

17:53.071 --> 17:54.807
- Where's your salsa bowl?
- Right here.

17:54.873 --> 17:57.509
- You can't just bring the jar.
- I had to pour it in?

17:57.576 --> 17:59.344
- No chips.
- Did you pour it in?

17:59.411 --> 18:01.280
- Did you get chips?
- Oh my gosh.

18:01.346 --> 18:02.681
- I need chips?
- Yeah.

18:02.748 --> 18:03.916
- I don't even remember.

18:03.982 --> 18:06.485
- [indistinct chatter]
- Just toss him.

18:06.552 --> 18:10.489
- Coby, after reviewing
the tape...you're out of here.

18:10.556 --> 18:13.358
{\an8}- See ya!
- DQ!

18:13.425 --> 18:15.194
{\an8}- Get out of the park!
- That is horrible!

18:15.260 --> 18:16.295
- Get out the cart.

18:16.361 --> 18:17.796
You're not worthy
to sit on the throne.

18:17.863 --> 18:21.667
{\an8}Alright, Cory, you got Cody
sitting at 4 minutes 41 seconds.

18:21.733 --> 18:24.136
{\an8}Very beatable. So...

18:24.203 --> 18:26.572
- Redeem the family name.
- Just do better.

18:26.638 --> 18:28.073
- Okay.
- Go!

18:28.140 --> 18:29.908
- Does he know how
to drive a golf cart?

18:29.975 --> 18:32.778
{\an8}- Coming in slow
on the clothes.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.279
{\an8}- Slow and steady
wins the race.

18:34.346 --> 18:36.582
{\an8}- Cory, a little faster
pace there, buddy.

18:36.648 --> 18:38.417
{\an8}And he gets it.

18:38.484 --> 18:40.319
{\an8}Very nice, you gotta
get your pillow!

18:40.385 --> 18:43.021
{\an8}- Thank you.
- And he's standing up.

18:43.088 --> 18:45.257
{\an8}- Uh!
- Onto the snack bar!

18:45.324 --> 18:47.192
{\an8}- Taking a little bit
of time here for sure.

18:47.259 --> 18:49.328
{\an8}- Yeah, I mean it's
definitely not a face pace.

18:49.394 --> 18:51.163
{\an8}- No, it's not.
- Going for a red one.

18:51.230 --> 18:53.165
{\an8}- I would've gone blue.

18:53.232 --> 18:55.767

on my--oh gross.

18:55.834 --> 18:56.902

19:10.082 --> 19:11.250
- That's gross, look at that.

19:11.316 --> 19:12.885
- That didn't look
relaxed at all to me.

19:12.951 --> 19:15.187
I mean, you were just
spilling things everywhere.

19:15.254 --> 19:16.855
So I'll give you one option.

19:16.922 --> 19:19.691
You take a time penalty or you
use that straw right there

19:19.758 --> 19:20.893
and you suck up that salsa.

19:20.959 --> 19:22.561

19:38.577 --> 19:40.112

19:44.283 --> 19:45.984
- No, you don't
have to use a straw.

19:46.051 --> 19:47.786

immediately.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.821
So, Ty, the time
to beat--which I still can't

19:49.888 --> 19:54.960
believe Cody's is the time
to beat--4 minutes 41 seconds.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.461
- Seems doable.

19:56.528 --> 20:00.465
- But if you do it, you will
be deemed the Sit-down Standoff

20:00.532 --> 20:04.269
Champion joining me
in what I like to call

20:04.336 --> 20:06.738

So are you ready to relax?
- I'm already there.

- On my mark, go!
- Slouch mode.

20:11.843 --> 20:15.380
Oh, he's off to a good start.
- He's off to a great start.

20:15.447 --> 20:17.549
{\an8}Get your shoes in the basket.
- He loves to win, man.

20:17.616 --> 20:21.253
{\an8}- Yeah, let's see.
- And a blanket. Wow.

20:21.320 --> 20:24.256
{\an8}And there he is.
- Strong, strong.

This is record time, folks.

- Ty, I gotta say,
your feet smell horrible.

21:05.998 --> 21:08.166
And you need to put some lotion
on those bad boys.

21:08.233 --> 21:10.168
That is absolutely disgusting.

21:10.235 --> 21:11.703
- I'm gonna shoot you straight.
- But--

21:11.770 --> 21:13.205
- I didn't wear socks
this morning.

21:13.271 --> 21:14.706
I was thinking,
"Nobody's gonna know.

21:14.773 --> 21:16.541
Why does it matter
if I wear socks?"

21:16.608 --> 21:20.646
Turns out, today was the day
to wear socks.

21:20.712 --> 21:24.783
- That should be a penalty but
it was--it wasn't addressed.

21:24.850 --> 21:27.552
- I agree.
- Give me a 30-second penalty.

21:27.619 --> 21:30.722
- And, Ty, this--
- Oh my gosh, it's amazing.

21:30.789 --> 21:31.857
- --is your trophy.

21:31.923 --> 21:33.458
But you kinda wanna
be careful with this,

21:33.525 --> 21:35.394
because there's like
live liquid up here.

21:35.460 --> 21:38.063

a potato on the bottom?

21:45.470 --> 21:47.239

my friend.

21:47.305 --> 21:49.908
