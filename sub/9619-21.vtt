{\an1}AT THE MEETING WE HAD

05:56.355 --> 05:57.657

{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, DO THEY EVER

05:58.891 --> 05:59.392
{\an1}CHANGE THEIR MINDS

05:59.459 --> 06:00.259
{\an1}BECAUSE I THOUGHT MY DESIGN

06:00.326 --> 06:01.728
{\an1}WAS REALLY GOOD.

06:01.794 --> 06:02.729
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, IN ALL MY YEARS,

{\an1}FOR TICKETS

06:07.467 --> 06:09.068

{\an1}WITH A BIG FASHION SHOW.

06:14.807 --> 06:15.308
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, MAYBE I CAN

06:15.374 --> 06:16.709
{\an1}GIVE MY DRESS INTO THAT SHOW.

06:16.776 --> 06:17.510
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DON'T EVEN TRY.

06:17.577 --> 06:18.544
{\an1}MANY TOP, TOP, TOP, TOP,

06:21.681 --> 06:23.549
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YES.

{\an1}&gt;&gt; YES AND I WISH I HAD

06:26.719 --> 06:27.620
{\an1}TWO BOXES OF ASSORTED BELTS

06:27.687 --> 06:28.287
{\an1}I SAW IN THE WAREHOUSE

06:28.354 --> 06:29.622

{\an1}&gt;&gt; MR. MADIGAN PLAYS THE PIANO?

06:40.800 --> 06:43.002
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HE'S A MAN OF MANY TALENTS.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.238
{\an1}PIANO IS NOT ONE OF THEM.

06:45.304 --> 06:46.539
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SO WHAT'S THE DEAL?

06:46.606 --> 06:47.306
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHENEVER HE'S FEELING TENSE,

06:47.373 --> 06:48.608

{\an1}IT USUALLY

06:49.108 --> 06:50.643
{\an1}ONLY LASTS A DAY OR TWO.

{\an1}&gt;&gt; OVER THE YEARS,

08:18.798 --> 08:19.532
{\an1}I'VE DEVISED PRECISELY

08:19.599 --> 08:20.700
{\an1}ONE MILLION PLANS,

08:20.766 --> 08:23.035

{\an1}THE KEY IS GETTING PAST

08:23.736 --> 08:25.805
{\an1}THE SECURITY GUARD.

{\an1}&gt;&gt; ARE YOU SAYING

08:26.439 --> 08:26.906
{\an1}I SHOULD PRETEND

08:26.973 --> 08:29.175

08:29.242 --> 08:29.775
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO, THAT'S ACTUALLY

08:29.842 --> 08:30.710
{\an1}WAY SMARTER THAN THE IDEA

08:30.776 --> 08:35.214
{\an1}I WAS ABOUT TO TELL YOU.

08:35.280 --> 08:36.816
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HEY, YOU WANT TO GO

09:00.273 --> 09:01.908
{\an1}PERP IS WHAT YOU CALL A BAD GUY.

09:01.974 --> 09:03.709
{\an1}YOU'LL LEARN ALL ABOUT IT, SON.

09:03.776 --> 09:04.944
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE

09:11.584 --> 09:12.051
{\an1}I JUST SAW A PERP

09:12.118 --> 09:12.952
{\an1}ENTER THE VENUE,

09:13.019 --> 09:16.255
{\an1}THAT MEANS BUILDING.

09:16.322 --> 09:17.390
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HEY, BUDDY.

09:17.456 --> 09:18.424
{\an1}WELL, WE DON'T HAVE TICKETS

09:18.491 --> 09:20.293

{\an1}&gt;&gt; SECURITY GUARDS

09:20.893 --> 09:21.494
{\an1}DON'T NEED TICKETS.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.095
{\an1}WE CAN GO WHEREVER WE WANT.

09:23.162 --> 09:24.163
{\an1}&gt;&gt; RIGHT, I'M PRETTY FAMILIAR

09:24.230 --> 09:26.966

09:27.934 --> 09:28.534
{\an1}JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE

09:28.601 --> 09:29.835
{\an1}YOU'RE AN ACTUAL EMPLOYEE,

09:29.902 --> 09:32.438
{\an1}NOT SOME SORT OF IMPOSTOR.

09:32.505 --> 09:33.239
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHY WOULD ANYONE

09:33.306 --> 09:35.675
{\an1}PRETEND TO BE A TICKET TAKER?

09:35.741 --> 09:36.943
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU'D BE SURPRISED, DAWG,

09:37.009 --> 09:38.844
{\an1}ALL SORTS OF CRAZIES OUT THERE.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.846

{\an1}&gt;&gt; STAY SAFE, GUY.

09:48.087 --> 09:51.257
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DON'T BE A HERO.

09:51.324 --> 09:51.791
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT WAS EASIER

09:51.857 --> 09:52.491
{\an1}THAN I THOUGHT IT TO BE.

09:52.558 --> 09:53.426
{\an1}&gt;&gt; AND THESE MUSCLE SUITS

09:53.492 --> 09:54.126
{\an1}ARE GREAT.

09:54.193 --> 09:54.827
{\an1}WANT TO GO TO THE OSCARS

10:10.543 --> 10:11.744
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT'S AWESOME BEING A COP.

10:11.811 --> 10:12.511
{\an1}IT'S LIKE HAVING A KEY

10:12.578 --> 10:14.413
{\an1}TO EVERY LOCK IN THE WORLD.

10:14.480 --> 10:15.581
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HEY, YOU TWO!

10:15.648 --> 10:16.115
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I HOPE THAT KEY

10:16.182 --> 10:18.517
{\an1}CAN OPEN UP A JAIL CELL.

10:18.584 --> 10:19.085
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU THINK

10:33.232 --> 10:33.833
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THEY'RE THE LOWEST FORM

10:33.899 --> 10:34.767
{\an1}OF HUMANITY, RIGHT BELOW
