03:36.756 --> 03:40.859
Yeah!

04:46.126 --> 04:48.160
<i>Steinar...</i>

04:48.162 --> 04:50.328
You were right.

04:52.031 --> 04:53.965
Some of them do have brains.

04:53.967 --> 04:56.501
More than can be said for you,
you fucking animal.

05:01.374 --> 05:03.575
Good that we wet our blades so quickly.

05:03.577 --> 05:05.577
They were just farmers.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.881
Well, now they're farming in Hell.

05:12.485 --> 05:15.253
The rest of our boats will be in by nightfall.

05:16.589 --> 05:18.590
Bring up the horses.

05:18.592 --> 05:20.592
Halfdan can follow once they've landed.

05:22.995 --> 05:25.063
My father's not a patient man.

05:28.100 --> 05:30.402
Grim, Jokul.

06:01.033 --> 06:03.368
If he's a Saxon, he's gonna
have a fuck of a surprise

06:03.370 --> 06:05.470
- <i>when he rides into us.</i>
- <i>That's no Saxon.</i>

06:11.644 --> 06:13.879
So this is our welcome.

06:17.550 --> 06:20.452
Vali, what's happened?

06:22.121 --> 06:24.522
The omens promised victory if we attacked early.

06:24.524 --> 06:26.591
The Gods were against us.

06:26.593 --> 06:28.627
Your father's badly wounded, Steinar.

06:33.933 --> 06:35.533
Take me to him.

07:49.075 --> 07:50.475
Steinar.

07:52.411 --> 07:54.646
Better late than never.

07:54.648 --> 07:56.681
I came when I said I would.

07:58.117 --> 08:00.018
And this is the army you brought with you?

08:03.656 --> 08:06.291
He was fed Gruel at first light.

08:06.293 --> 08:09.294
The onions can already be smelled
through his stomach.

08:09.296 --> 08:12.163
If his guts are pierced,
there's nothing more we can do.

08:12.165 --> 08:13.698
How long?

08:13.700 --> 08:16.468
A week, maybe less.

08:18.070 --> 08:20.572
Listen, Steinar,

08:20.574 --> 08:23.775
I know we haven't always seen eye to eye,

08:23.777 --> 08:25.777
but we're still brothers after all

08:25.779 --> 08:27.779
and I want you to know that when I'm King

08:27.781 --> 08:30.648
I'll make sure you're taken care of.

08:58.210 --> 09:02.047
The omens deceived us, Steinar.

09:03.816 --> 09:06.751
An army of 500 are only hours behind me.

09:07.753 --> 09:10.522
All this talk of reason...

09:12.358 --> 09:14.793
sounds like a cover-up for weakness.

09:14.795 --> 09:17.829
<i>We lie here because
we have no choice.</i>

09:17.831 --> 09:19.831
We need land!

09:19.833 --> 09:21.800
We either take it

09:21.802 --> 09:23.735
<i>or our people perish.</i>

09:23.737 --> 09:25.637
We may have lost the battle, father,

09:25.639 --> 09:27.272
but we can still win the war.

09:27.274 --> 09:30.275
And who'll lead them?

09:30.277 --> 09:32.677
You?

09:32.679 --> 09:36.848
In all your fucking finery?

09:42.822 --> 09:46.324
I will lead our army, father.

09:46.326 --> 09:48.660
You're no more fit than he is.

09:48.662 --> 09:53.164
Once, maybe.

09:53.166 --> 09:55.733
But after your mother left...

09:57.803 --> 09:59.838
you changed,

09:59.840 --> 10:02.240
turned your back on the Gods.

10:02.242 --> 10:04.442
Thought you knew better, huh?

10:04.444 --> 10:06.711
I am strong enough to be King.

10:13.652 --> 10:15.887
Then prove it.

10:15.889 --> 10:17.722
Your half brother--

10:17.724 --> 10:20.692
my bastard son--

10:20.694 --> 10:23.528
<i>refused to enter the field of battle.</i>

10:23.530 --> 10:26.698
I made him swear an oath
to wait till I returned.

10:26.700 --> 10:30.168
You know the punishment for those
that turn their back in combat.

10:30.170 --> 10:31.703
See it's done.

10:54.760 --> 10:56.561
I will do it, father.

10:56.563 --> 10:59.564
Leave him, Harald.
Leave him!

10:59.566 --> 11:02.634
Get out, now!

11:12.645 --> 11:14.846
Not you, Steinar.

11:21.654 --> 11:25.657
There's a man worthy of this crown,

11:25.659 --> 11:28.526
a man with fire in his heart,

11:28.528 --> 11:32.664
brave enough to wield
the Hammer of the Gods--

11:35.734 --> 11:38.570
my firstborn.

11:38.572 --> 11:41.206
You said you'd kill anyone
who mentioned his name.

11:42.708 --> 11:44.475
The time has passed.

11:46.278 --> 11:47.879
Nobody knows where he is.

11:47.881 --> 11:49.714
He hasn't been seen for years.

11:51.383 --> 11:53.284
Find your brother.

11:53.286 --> 11:55.587
Find Hakan.

11:55.589 --> 11:58.990
Return with a King who will lead us to victory.

11:58.992 --> 12:00.491
I am needed here.

12:00.493 --> 12:02.660
I may be dying,

12:02.662 --> 12:04.362
but I'm still your King.

12:04.364 --> 12:06.364
Defy me again,

12:06.366 --> 12:09.934
and I will cut your heart out myself.

12:09.936 --> 12:12.737
Now swear

12:12.739 --> 12:16.341
on the memory of your mother.

12:22.448 --> 12:24.449
I swear.

12:29.688 --> 12:31.956
You're out of your fucking mind.

12:31.958 --> 12:34.826
- I swore an oath.
- Oaths are horseshit, Steinar.

12:34.828 --> 12:37.829
I gave him my word.
I will not break it.

12:37.831 --> 12:40.665
Hakan is almost certain to be dead by now.

12:40.667 --> 12:43.401
And if he's not, he was fucking insane
before he was banished;

12:43.403 --> 12:45.270
he'll only be more so now.

12:46.705 --> 12:49.674
Anyway, who knows where the fuck he is?

12:52.811 --> 12:54.779
- You do.
- It's too dangerous.

12:54.781 --> 12:57.448
Dangerous, is it?

12:57.450 --> 13:00.351
Then you must know where he is.

13:02.521 --> 13:05.657
Listen,
say I do know--

13:05.659 --> 13:08.059
which I don't,
but say I did--

13:08.061 --> 13:10.561
what makes you think he'd come back?

13:10.563 --> 13:12.630
It's the King's wish.

13:12.632 --> 13:15.633
The King will be dead in a week.

13:18.304 --> 13:22.006
Bide your time.
Be close at hand when he dies.

13:22.008 --> 13:24.575
And when the moment's right,
you take the crown for yourself.

13:26.612 --> 13:28.313
We'd all back you against Harald.

13:35.621 --> 13:37.322
Think about it.

14:15.527 --> 14:18.596
When I said I didn't know where Hakan was,
I spoke the truth.

14:21.033 --> 14:24.469
But I do know how to find the last
man who saw him.

14:24.471 --> 14:27.538
Whether he's capable of helping us
remains to be seen.

14:55.567 --> 14:58.035
- Going somewhere?
- It doesn't concern you, grim.

14:58.037 --> 15:00.104
Let us pass.

15:00.106 --> 15:02.573
- <i>Like fuck.</i>
- <i>You'd think differently</i>

15:02.575 --> 15:04.475
if you knew where we were going.

15:04.477 --> 15:06.477
We're heading for the black mountains

15:06.479 --> 15:08.413
in search of Ivar the boneless.

15:08.415 --> 15:10.848
That fat fuck?

15:10.850 --> 15:13.451
Last night I heard he chopped his own head off.

15:13.453 --> 15:15.920
Well, I heard he transformed himself
into a bear.

15:18.590 --> 15:21.859
What do you want with that
cocksucking maniac anyway?

15:21.861 --> 15:24.662
He's the only one who can lead us to Hakan.

15:26.999 --> 15:29.700
It's a two-day ride
through saxon country,

15:29.702 --> 15:31.202
and who knows after that?

15:33.205 --> 15:36.541
You think we're cowards, is that it?

15:36.543 --> 15:38.609
It sounds like it to me.

15:38.611 --> 15:41.946
'Cause if it is, you can kiss my fucking axe.

15:41.948 --> 15:43.881
<i>I looked at the bones,
Steinar.</i>

15:43.883 --> 15:46.484
It's already been decided--
we'll travel together.

15:46.486 --> 15:48.653
- The bones said that?
- Aye.

15:48.655 --> 15:51.155
How far do you think you'll get?

15:51.157 --> 15:55.126
Take us with you--
you double your odds.

16:00.533 --> 16:02.233
Not you, vali.

16:03.669 --> 16:05.503
Well, why not?

16:05.505 --> 16:07.672
'Cause your sword's as limp as your cock, boy.

16:13.245 --> 16:16.647
Steinar, take me with you.

16:16.649 --> 16:19.150
Watch Harald, hmm?

16:19.152 --> 16:21.152
Report to me when I get back.

16:56.655 --> 16:58.656
The sun is sinking.

17:00.125 --> 17:02.126
Let's find a place to rest.

17:02.128 --> 17:04.127
Yeah.

17:20.112 --> 17:22.713
There was a time
when they did everything together--

17:22.714 --> 17:25.148
Hakan and Ivar.

17:25.151 --> 17:27.285
My father went raiding with them--

17:27.287 --> 17:29.320
fucking carnage.

17:29.322 --> 17:31.989
After Hakan was banished,

17:31.991 --> 17:35.092
people were less willing to tolerate
Ivar's behavior.

17:36.863 --> 17:38.563
<i>He knew where Hakan had gone,</i>

17:38.565 --> 17:40.865
so he set off after him.

17:40.867 --> 17:42.867
Why do they call him boneless?

17:42.869 --> 17:46.070
Because you could never see his cock,

17:46.072 --> 17:48.606
'cause it was always rammed to the hilt

17:48.608 --> 17:50.074
up some young boy's asshole.

17:51.610 --> 17:54.111
<i>They say he felt
no pain.</i>

17:54.113 --> 17:56.948
Which is more than can be said for
the young boy's asshole.

17:59.018 --> 18:01.352
I fought beside him a couple of times.

18:03.889 --> 18:06.757
Whatever people think of Ivar now,

18:06.759 --> 18:09.093
he was something to behold in battle.

18:10.596 --> 18:12.296
They both were.

18:12.298 --> 18:14.865
Why did my father banish Hakan?

18:14.867 --> 18:17.768
He was cursed.

18:17.770 --> 18:19.670
Your father had his reasons.

18:21.139 --> 18:23.007
Maybe it doesn't matter what he did.

18:23.009 --> 18:25.076
It does if he's gonna be King.

19:19.131 --> 19:21.132
Steinar, it's me!

19:21.134 --> 19:24.268
Argh!

19:24.270 --> 19:27.038
You'll get yourself killed.

19:27.040 --> 19:29.840
I did as you said.

19:29.842 --> 19:31.842
I followed Harald.

19:31.844 --> 19:34.045
He rode out almost the minute you left.

19:34.047 --> 19:37.014
He crossed the saxon lines
and spoke to their King.

19:37.016 --> 19:38.449
Fucking snake!

19:38.451 --> 19:40.951
I didn't know what to do.

19:42.988 --> 19:45.089
You did the right thing, vali.

19:45.091 --> 19:47.158
You should head back now,
before they notice you're gone.

19:47.160 --> 19:49.160
No, it's too dangerous.

19:50.996 --> 19:52.997
Vali can ride with us.

19:52.999 --> 19:54.799
Grim, get him some food.

19:54.801 --> 19:56.867
He can get his own food.
We turn back,

19:56.869 --> 19:59.303
cut Harald's balls off and rip out his spine.

19:59.305 --> 20:01.772
No. We continue
our ride north.

20:01.774 --> 20:05.910
Steinar, Harald's cut a deal with the Saxons.

20:05.912 --> 20:08.045
Our men would never back Harald.

20:08.047 --> 20:10.881
It's one thing to want
the crown, another to take it.

20:10.883 --> 20:13.718
You'd rather we have us climbing mountains

20:13.720 --> 20:16.787
on some fucking bear hunt
while your cunt fuck of a brother

20:16.789 --> 20:18.489
sells our women to a bunch of farmers!

20:18.491 --> 20:21.759
Our women are more than a match for Harald.

20:21.761 --> 20:24.495
Grim,

20:24.497 --> 20:27.498
nobody forced you to come.

20:27.500 --> 20:30.201
Nobody's forcing you to stay.

21:01.533 --> 21:04.435
Oh, I know you struggle with your beliefs,

21:04.437 --> 21:07.404
that you deny the Gods
and the significance of signs...

21:09.141 --> 21:11.308
But a lone rider arriving under a full Moon?

21:13.145 --> 21:16.147
Even you can't deny what a bad omen
that is for all of us.

21:16.149 --> 21:18.282
He's young.
He's got good instincts.

21:18.284 --> 21:20.284
He brings death with him.

21:23.321 --> 21:25.422
I'm not about to turn against him

21:25.424 --> 21:27.892
for the sake of your superstitions.

21:27.894 --> 21:30.394
If a man doesn't believe in omens,

21:30.396 --> 21:33.197
then how can he know what he believes in?

21:37.169 --> 21:39.804
He can believe in himself.

22:11.436 --> 22:14.305
<i>No!</i>

22:21.313 --> 22:22.847
We should ride on.

22:24.382 --> 22:26.851
You bitch!

22:30.456 --> 22:32.556
You're right.

22:38.530 --> 22:40.464
Stop!

22:59.618 --> 23:00.951
Stop.

23:12.664 --> 23:14.632
- Let her go.
- Fuck you, heathen.

23:18.169 --> 23:19.436
Argh!

24:11.690 --> 24:14.191
- You all right?
- Crazy fucking bitch.

24:19.030 --> 24:20.230
Let's go.

24:43.521 --> 24:45.522
The horses won't make it much further.

24:47.225 --> 24:48.592
Then we continue on foot.

24:54.332 --> 24:57.201
Vali, you wait with the horses till we return.

24:57.203 --> 24:59.269
Don't light a fire.

24:59.271 --> 25:01.338
Fires attract cave trolls.

25:01.340 --> 25:03.474
Don't worry.

25:03.476 --> 25:06.243
They only eat virgins.

25:06.245 --> 25:09.046
They'll eat anything if they're hungry enough.

25:10.448 --> 25:13.784
Speaking of cave trolls, how is your sister?

25:13.786 --> 25:15.652
Fuck you, grim.

25:15.654 --> 25:18.088
She certainly did.

25:18.090 --> 25:19.723
Still hurts when I piss.

25:22.794 --> 25:24.728
We'll be back by first light.

25:24.730 --> 25:26.196
Steinar.

25:29.234 --> 25:30.401
Thanks.

25:30.403 --> 25:32.069
We're brothers.

26:00.299 --> 26:02.466
What was that?

26:18.516 --> 26:20.551
Perhaps we should wait till nightfall.

26:22.720 --> 26:24.721
Some creatures fear the Moon.

26:24.723 --> 26:27.091
It would be safer.

27:20.578 --> 27:23.547
Ivar, it's me--
hagen grettison.

27:23.549 --> 27:26.617
My name is Steinar, son of bagsecg.

27:26.619 --> 27:28.619
What the fuck are you doing here, prince?

27:32.490 --> 27:34.925
You wanna fuck with me?

27:34.927 --> 27:37.494
I'll bet you do.
I'll bet you do.

27:37.496 --> 27:39.763
<i>Ivar, the King is dying.</i>

27:39.765 --> 27:41.532
We need your help.

27:42.901 --> 27:45.269
Everyone dies some time.

27:45.271 --> 27:47.304
How about you, prince?

27:47.306 --> 27:50.674
Do you want to die today?

27:50.676 --> 27:52.543
We seek the new King--

27:52.545 --> 27:54.444
Hakan.

28:07.825 --> 28:10.594
So you're looking for your brother?

28:17.869 --> 28:19.336
Know where he is?

28:19.338 --> 28:21.972
Why the Hell would I tell you?

28:24.476 --> 28:26.443
Out of respect.

28:28.480 --> 28:30.881
Respect is not a birthright, little prince.

28:30.883 --> 28:34.818
You want someone's respect,
you've got to earn it.

28:34.820 --> 28:37.521
You want to earn my respect?

28:39.958 --> 28:43.560
You'd better be stronger than you look.

29:07.952 --> 29:10.721
- There has to be another way.
- He feels no pain.

29:10.723 --> 29:14.491
The only way he'll tell us is through choice.

29:17.929 --> 29:20.731
Three cups for your three chances.

29:20.733 --> 29:23.700
You win-- I'll tell you
everything you want.

29:23.702 --> 29:26.036
I win-- you drink.

29:26.038 --> 29:29.973
You drink all three--
you lose

29:29.975 --> 29:33.910
and you're mine for the night,
to do with as I see fit.

29:42.787 --> 29:45.522
Ah.

29:45.524 --> 29:47.724
First to fold or break.

29:51.029 --> 29:52.429
Begin!

29:53.831 --> 29:56.333
<i>Come on, Steinar.</i>

29:56.335 --> 29:58.068
- <i>Come on, Steinar.</i>
- <i>Put your shoulder into it.</i>

29:58.070 --> 29:59.803
- <i>Take him, Steinar.</i>
- <i>Come on, Steinar.</i>

29:59.805 --> 30:02.005
- <i>Come on.</i>
- <i>Take him.</i>

30:04.943 --> 30:06.977
Drink up, little prince.

30:16.087 --> 30:18.522
That'll put hairs on your ball sack.

30:21.893 --> 30:23.327
Tell me you have a plan.

30:25.763 --> 30:29.533
Shall we go again while our cocks
are still hard?

30:33.438 --> 30:36.373
First to fold or break.

30:36.375 --> 30:38.075
- Begin.
- Come on.

30:38.077 --> 30:40.077
- <i>Put your shoulder into it.</i>
- <i>Come on.</i>

30:40.079 --> 30:44.414
Come on!
Come on.

30:44.416 --> 30:46.817
<i>Come on, Steinar.</i>

30:50.488 --> 30:52.956
- Oh, fuck!
- Fuck.

30:52.958 --> 30:55.058
Two down,

30:55.060 --> 30:56.827
one to go.

30:56.829 --> 30:59.563
What chance now, Princess, hmm?

31:22.920 --> 31:25.155
Jokul, your belt.

31:25.157 --> 31:27.991
Give me your belt, quick.

31:27.993 --> 31:29.993
Your belt.

31:29.995 --> 31:32.963
Good, Steinar.
The serpent will protect you.

31:32.965 --> 31:35.999
With the Gods on your side,
you can't lose. Hmm?

31:37.668 --> 31:39.102
Yeah.

31:40.671 --> 31:42.973
We've got your back.
You know that.

31:42.975 --> 31:45.175
But the only way we'll stop him
is if we kill him.

31:46.177 --> 31:48.812
Ahh.

31:48.814 --> 31:53.183
I am looking forward to making a woman
out of you, Princess.

31:53.185 --> 31:56.052
Oh, don't look so sad.

31:56.054 --> 31:58.855
You might even enjoy it.

32:02.060 --> 32:04.027
First to fold or break.

32:11.068 --> 32:12.436
Begin.

32:12.438 --> 32:14.571
Come on, Steinar, push!

32:14.573 --> 32:16.606
Come on, break his fucking wrist.

32:16.608 --> 32:19.476
Come on! Come on!

32:25.850 --> 32:28.552
Oh. Oh. Argh!

32:33.791 --> 32:36.193
Ooh ooh.

32:36.195 --> 32:37.761
Ooh.

32:37.763 --> 32:40.163
What did you say your name was?

32:40.165 --> 32:41.932
Steinar.

32:41.934 --> 32:44.234
You're an asshole, Steinar.

32:47.638 --> 32:49.639
I like assholes.

33:07.525 --> 33:10.794
I didn't leave out of choice.

33:10.796 --> 33:15.165
I became persona non grata.

33:15.167 --> 33:18.034
That's latin.
Hakan taught me that.

33:18.036 --> 33:22.606
He's a prodigious man, a great man really.

33:22.608 --> 33:25.075
How come you're not with him now?

33:25.077 --> 33:29.513
You kill people in battle--
they love you for it.

33:29.515 --> 33:31.848
Make a mistake
with a couple of boys--

33:31.850 --> 33:33.750
they treat you like a leper.

33:39.290 --> 33:41.558
You all right there, Princess.

33:42.727 --> 33:45.095
Feeling
the 'shrooms-s-s-s?

33:49.167 --> 33:53.169
Ah, Hakan's not the man he was.

33:53.171 --> 33:56.006
Not a man at all really.

33:56.008 --> 33:59.976
You see, we're--
we're all this,

33:59.978 --> 34:01.978
but he--

34:01.980 --> 34:06.316
he's all that up there,

34:06.318 --> 34:09.686
all around us.

34:09.688 --> 34:13.556
Do you think he is just gonna pack up
and follow you,

34:13.559 --> 34:16.826
rule the people that banished him?

34:16.828 --> 34:19.129
Why would he even speak to you, look at you?

34:22.199 --> 34:24.333
He already knows you're coming.

34:28.672 --> 34:30.206
Then he won't mind...

34:32.342 --> 34:34.578
if you tell us

34:34.580 --> 34:36.679
where he is.

34:36.681 --> 34:40.116
But if I do that, you're going to die.

34:41.851 --> 34:44.588
Well, everybody has to die.

34:50.696 --> 34:53.096
Oh.

34:53.098 --> 34:55.732
Oh, fuck it, Princess,

34:55.734 --> 34:58.668
<i>i'll do better than
tell you where he is.</i>

35:00.638 --> 35:02.872
I'll take you there myself.

35:02.874 --> 35:05.108
Why the Hell not?

35:05.110 --> 35:08.645
Why the fucking Hell not, hmm?

35:28.366 --> 35:31.234
Ah.

35:49.220 --> 35:52.355
Helps you see through the clouds,
to find the sun.

35:52.357 --> 35:54.924
- Is it magic?
- No such thing as magic.

36:07.738 --> 36:09.239
It's inscribed.?

36:09.241 --> 36:11.741
Yeah. Who taught you
to read?

36:12.877 --> 36:14.411
I was at a monastery.

36:16.180 --> 36:18.014
They taught me...

36:19.684 --> 36:21.918
many things.

36:42.206 --> 36:45.375
Here, here you go.
Have this.

36:47.445 --> 36:49.946
You blow it.

37:00.758 --> 37:02.759
Boneless says there's a runestone

37:02.761 --> 37:04.761
two days from here at the edge of a forest

37:04.763 --> 37:07.130
at the foot of the western mountains.

37:07.132 --> 37:10.033
Says he'll take us there
and the runes will lead us to Hakan.

37:10.035 --> 37:12.001
- And you trust him?
- Why not?

37:12.003 --> 37:14.471
- <i>Because he's a maniac.</i>
- <i>Oh yeah, that he is.</i>

37:15.840 --> 37:17.741
But he's our maniac now.

38:05.556 --> 38:07.123
Vali!

38:07.125 --> 38:08.825
First the sun,

38:08.827 --> 38:10.560
and now the ashes painted red.

38:10.562 --> 38:12.262
Vali!

38:14.865 --> 38:16.366
Vali!

38:19.136 --> 38:21.204
- Steinar.
- Vali.

38:21.206 --> 38:22.906
- <i>Steinar.</i>
- <i>Are you all right?</i>

38:22.908 --> 38:25.308
What happened here?
What happened?

38:26.343 --> 38:27.944
Men came.

38:29.213 --> 38:31.281
Last night.

38:31.283 --> 38:33.983
I heard voices.
I thought it was you.

38:33.985 --> 38:35.985
How come there's not a scratch on you?

38:35.987 --> 38:38.121
It's another omen.

38:38.123 --> 38:41.291
We should turn back.
The Gods are against us.

38:41.293 --> 38:43.560
Who did this?
Thieves?

38:44.995 --> 38:47.530
Thieves would have taken all the horses.

38:47.532 --> 38:51.401
Someone trying to fuck with you.

38:51.403 --> 38:53.903
You wanna fuck with us?
Come on.

38:53.905 --> 38:56.139
Come on!

38:56.141 --> 38:59.375
Ivar, how long will it take us
to get there on foot?

38:59.377 --> 39:02.011
Depends how determined you are.

39:02.013 --> 39:04.180
Determined.

40:00.437 --> 40:02.505
We should wait for the Moon to guide us.

40:02.507 --> 40:04.540
Shut your mouth about the fucking Moon.

40:09.014 --> 40:11.114
Listen.

40:18.088 --> 40:21.124
Vali, you two, wait here.

40:46.717 --> 40:49.585
Fuck this.
Let's fight!

40:49.587 --> 40:51.020
Grim!

40:51.022 --> 40:52.956
Argh!

41:20.284 --> 41:22.185
Fuck.

41:57.788 --> 41:59.489
Steinar!

42:42.299 --> 42:45.068
Arghh!

44:33.610 --> 44:35.945
We should go after them, finish them off.

44:37.181 --> 44:38.447
We move on.

44:41.251 --> 44:43.352
I told you to wait.

44:43.354 --> 44:45.755
I'm not a child, Steinar.

44:45.757 --> 44:47.757
<i>Go and get the girl.</i>

44:47.759 --> 44:49.458
Now.

44:55.732 --> 44:57.867
<i>Steinar!</i>

45:02.573 --> 45:04.607
Steinar!

45:09.580 --> 45:12.515
He died a good death,

45:12.517 --> 45:14.650
with his axe in his hand.

45:18.989 --> 45:21.224
Valhalla won't know what hit them.

46:32.629 --> 46:34.764
There's a clear view on the hill.

46:34.766 --> 46:36.899
Vali, get up there,

46:36.901 --> 46:39.302
shout if you see anything.

46:39.304 --> 46:41.604
How's Ivar?

46:41.606 --> 46:43.873
Nearly done.

46:46.643 --> 46:48.944
We need to move on as soon as we can.

46:48.946 --> 46:51.747
We have to reach Hakan.

47:55.512 --> 47:57.813
They were no ordinary Saxons.

47:57.815 --> 47:59.882
They were too well armed,

47:59.884 --> 48:01.584
too well trained.

48:03.387 --> 48:05.121
They didn't just run into us.

48:05.123 --> 48:07.056
You think we're being hunted?

48:09.126 --> 48:12.495
If Harald made an alliance with their King,

48:12.497 --> 48:15.164
then getting rid of me
would be part of the deal.

48:17.768 --> 48:19.969
They'd need to know where to look for you.

48:22.973 --> 48:25.107
Maybe someone's helping them.

48:25.109 --> 48:28.711
Don't tell me you believe in all that
crap about Moons and omens.

48:28.713 --> 48:30.679
I believe what I see with my own eyes.

48:30.681 --> 48:32.148
Right.

48:32.150 --> 48:33.883
Here.

48:35.452 --> 48:37.420
Vali dropped it.

48:38.989 --> 48:40.823
Look at the markings.

48:42.659 --> 48:45.428
It's a saxon coin.

48:45.430 --> 48:47.863
You think vali is a servant of our enemies?

48:47.865 --> 48:51.534
If he serves Harald, who himself serves
the Saxons, it amounts to the same thing.

48:51.536 --> 48:54.670
All from a piece of silver?
He's my brother.

48:54.672 --> 48:57.173
Half brother.
His mother's a Saxon.

48:57.175 --> 49:01.777
- Listen to yourself.
- You say you believe in reason and logic.

49:01.779 --> 49:04.180
When it's presented to you,
you turn your back on it.

49:04.182 --> 49:06.782
In what way do my actions
betray a lack of reason?

49:06.784 --> 49:08.984
You run when you should fight.

49:08.986 --> 49:12.121
You set off on this meaningless quest

49:12.123 --> 49:14.523
when you should be leading your people.

49:14.525 --> 49:16.525
And then you side with a bastard traitor

49:16.527 --> 49:18.527
who would stick a knife in your back,

49:18.529 --> 49:20.529
rather than your oldest friend.

49:20.531 --> 49:22.531
What would you have me do, huh?

49:22.533 --> 49:24.033
Hmm? Kill him?

49:24.035 --> 49:25.534
Better if you did.

49:25.536 --> 49:28.537
He's a child.
Think about that.

49:30.073 --> 49:33.209
Think about your two daughters.

49:33.211 --> 49:35.778
Dark times

49:35.780 --> 49:38.581
call for dark deeds, Steinar.

49:39.816 --> 49:43.018
You're wrong, hagen.

49:43.020 --> 49:45.588
They call for light.

49:52.929 --> 49:55.698
Steinar!

50:03.507 --> 50:05.741
Come on.

50:11.715 --> 50:12.948
Hurry up!

50:29.966 --> 50:32.535
- We can't outrun them!
- I'll slow them down!

50:46.650 --> 50:47.816
Damn.

51:59.789 --> 52:01.390
What do they call you?

52:03.259 --> 52:06.195
Come on, you must have a name.

52:06.197 --> 52:08.130
Go fuck yourself.

52:10.934 --> 52:12.701
That's disappointing.

52:14.671 --> 52:16.705
I had expected more from a prince.

52:16.707 --> 52:19.208
Whatever deal you struck with my brother,

52:20.410 --> 52:21.910
it won't last.

52:21.912 --> 52:23.912
Brother.

52:30.787 --> 52:33.022
Right now

52:33.024 --> 52:36.392
we're in a position where
we can help each other.

52:36.394 --> 52:38.260
<i>I could help make sure</i>

52:38.262 --> 52:41.664
you become King of your people.

52:41.666 --> 52:44.800
We could forge a real alliance

52:44.802 --> 52:46.802
that could last generations.

52:46.804 --> 52:48.971
- Under the shadow of the cross?
- Under the protection

52:48.973 --> 52:51.874
of a benevolent King and a church

52:51.876 --> 52:54.677
that would encourage education and learning.

52:54.679 --> 52:56.679
Well, I can see the benefits

52:56.681 --> 52:58.947
in education and learning,

52:58.949 --> 53:01.183
<i>but when you start
talking about your God,</i>

53:01.185 --> 53:03.352
reason

53:03.354 --> 53:05.287
doesn't really come into it, does it?

53:16.466 --> 53:18.467
Think about it.

54:17.495 --> 54:21.497
Come on, just a sip.

54:39.383 --> 54:42.184
Cut my ropes.

54:42.186 --> 54:43.886
Watch out!

54:43.888 --> 54:45.487
Stab him again.

54:45.489 --> 54:47.823
<i>And again.</i>

54:48.925 --> 54:52.060
And again.
And again.

55:29.232 --> 55:30.933
You all right?

55:34.470 --> 55:36.305
What about him?

55:36.307 --> 55:38.440
Didn't like being tied up.

55:38.442 --> 55:40.509
Took one of the guard's ears off.

55:40.511 --> 55:42.211
Where's vali?

55:43.847 --> 55:45.981
He went with them to meet their holy men

55:45.983 --> 55:48.984
and bow down before the white Christ.

55:54.557 --> 55:56.058
Keep him alive.

55:56.060 --> 55:57.626
We need him to tell us where we're going.

55:59.896 --> 56:03.198
- I'm not leaving without vali.
- Look, Steinar.

56:03.200 --> 56:05.601
He denied the existence of the Gods.

56:05.603 --> 56:07.236
He begged to be converted.

57:12.669 --> 57:15.604
Let the boy go.

57:15.606 --> 57:19.341
You dare break the sanctity of the House of God?

57:19.343 --> 57:22.411
You talk of reason.
When it comes down to it,

57:22.413 --> 57:24.713
<i>you're just as superstitious
as the rest of them.</i>

57:24.715 --> 57:26.715
Now lay down your weapons

57:26.717 --> 57:28.717
and let the boy go.

57:43.499 --> 57:46.702
Oh, we will hunt you down

57:46.704 --> 57:50.172
and kill you like the godless animals you are.

57:50.174 --> 57:52.708
You go to such lengths

57:52.710 --> 57:55.744
to build these churches,

57:55.746 --> 57:59.081
making sure they strike terror

57:59.083 --> 58:01.483
into the hearts

58:01.485 --> 58:04.119
of all who come near.

58:06.189 --> 58:08.457
It's just a room with a door...

58:11.561 --> 58:14.029
no different to a prison.

58:15.365 --> 58:17.733
<i>Steinar!</i>

58:23.139 --> 58:25.640
Secure them inside!

58:25.642 --> 58:27.376
Get in!

58:38.421 --> 58:40.555
Do we have what we need to find Hakan?

58:47.430 --> 58:50.399
You were true to your word.

58:54.470 --> 58:57.572
Remember me to him, prince.

58:57.574 --> 59:00.542
<i>When you see him,</i>

59:00.544 --> 59:04.679
his eyes pierce the soul.

59:06.449 --> 59:08.450
He knows

59:08.452 --> 59:12.454
who you truly are, hmm?

59:12.456 --> 59:15.624
Like a God...

59:17.593 --> 59:19.428
sees men.

59:22.065 --> 59:25.534
You believe in the Gods, don't you, hmm?

59:25.536 --> 59:27.569
You believe in...

59:29.639 --> 59:31.706
Valhalla?

59:35.178 --> 59:37.813
Yeah.

59:37.815 --> 59:40.449
Oh.

59:40.451 --> 59:43.652
Valhalla, I'm coming.

59:58.367 --> 01:00:00.836
Shh shh.

01:00:29.198 --> 01:00:31.233
Whose was this?

01:00:32.902 --> 01:00:35.604
- It belonged to my mother.
- What happened to her?

01:00:35.606 --> 01:00:38.907
She was

01:00:38.909 --> 01:00:41.443
swallowed up into the darkness.

01:00:46.449 --> 01:00:48.583
Like everything else.

01:01:16.412 --> 01:01:19.314
- Are you finished?
- The boy.

01:01:19.316 --> 01:01:22.384
- <i>What about him?</i>
- <i>He went willingly,</i>

01:01:22.386 --> 01:01:24.753
prepared to accept the white Christ.

01:01:27.423 --> 01:01:30.725
It was that or death.

01:01:30.727 --> 01:01:33.528
You didn't yield and neither did we.

01:01:36.332 --> 01:01:38.767
And I won't now.

01:01:38.769 --> 01:01:40.569
Vali has brought us nothing but bad luck.

01:01:40.571 --> 01:01:42.204
If we offer him up as a sacrifice,

01:01:42.206 --> 01:01:44.839
the Gods will look over us
for the rest of our journey.

01:01:44.841 --> 01:01:47.676
It's worth it to safeguard
the future of our people.

01:01:47.678 --> 01:01:51.713
So long as there's men who think
like you, our people have no future.

01:01:51.715 --> 01:01:55.951
He's a traitor and a coward.
And he deserves to die.

01:01:55.953 --> 01:01:59.287
- Step aside, Steinar.
- Don't make me do this.

01:01:59.289 --> 01:02:01.756
Then you leave me no choice.

01:02:38.628 --> 01:02:39.861
Yield!

01:03:40.323 --> 01:03:41.589
No!

01:03:43.659 --> 01:03:45.360
No!

01:04:15.491 --> 01:04:17.492
What about the people in the church?

01:06:15.744 --> 01:06:17.245
Wait.

01:06:31.627 --> 01:06:33.628
<i>No, we shouldn't touch it.</i>

01:06:33.630 --> 01:06:35.897
I'm telling you, this isn't just
somebody's head on a stick.

01:06:35.899 --> 01:06:37.899
This is a sign.

01:06:37.901 --> 01:06:41.803
This is telling us to stay the fuck away.

01:06:41.805 --> 01:06:43.571
<i>Well, what is it?</i>

01:06:43.573 --> 01:06:45.840
It's a runestone.

01:06:45.842 --> 01:06:48.109
This is what Ivar was leading us to.

01:06:48.111 --> 01:06:52.080
This isn't good, Steinar, I'm telling you.

01:06:54.216 --> 01:06:56.718
To find Hakan, we had to find this first.

01:06:59.021 --> 01:07:00.288
What does it say?

01:07:03.225 --> 01:07:06.194
This isn't telling us how to find Hakan.

01:07:06.196 --> 01:07:08.763
It's a warning,

01:07:08.765 --> 01:07:11.132
saying what will happen if we try.

01:07:11.134 --> 01:07:13.234
Well, what does it mean?

01:07:13.236 --> 01:07:15.270
It means we're close,

01:07:15.272 --> 01:07:17.972
nothing more, nothing less.

01:07:17.974 --> 01:07:19.974
I can't go in there, Steinar.

01:07:19.976 --> 01:07:22.610
I just can't.

01:07:22.612 --> 01:07:25.880
- <i>Nothing to fear, Jokul.</i>
- <i>I know these things.</i>

01:07:25.882 --> 01:07:28.016
If I step foot in that forest, I'm dead.

01:07:28.018 --> 01:07:29.984
You'll be dead if you don't.

01:08:37.987 --> 01:08:39.720
Jokul.

01:08:43.859 --> 01:08:45.859
Agnes!

01:11:50.813 --> 01:11:52.880
You're not dead...

01:11:55.150 --> 01:11:57.118
Not yet anyway.

01:12:00.823 --> 01:12:04.258
You want to know why you're not dead?

01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:05.426
Huh?

01:12:07.496 --> 01:12:10.431
Huh? Huh?

01:12:13.035 --> 01:12:15.603
Because he chose it.

01:12:15.605 --> 01:12:19.307
He decides who lives, who dies.

01:12:24.112 --> 01:12:26.480
Who are you, huh?

01:12:26.482 --> 01:12:29.550
I am

01:12:29.552 --> 01:12:31.986
Ulric the chronicler...

01:12:34.356 --> 01:12:38.159
a humble servant of the great master.

01:12:38.161 --> 01:12:41.162
Well, Ulric,

01:12:41.164 --> 01:12:44.398
if you wouldn't mind telling the great master

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:47.168
that his brother's here to see him.

01:12:49.172 --> 01:12:51.873
He has no brother,

01:12:51.875 --> 01:12:55.176
no father, no mother.

01:12:55.178 --> 01:12:57.211
I'll tell him what you said though.

01:12:58.947 --> 01:13:01.249
It might amuse him.

01:14:05.147 --> 01:14:06.514
Vali?

01:14:09.118 --> 01:14:12.553
Vali, untie me.

01:14:18.126 --> 01:14:20.494
Vali, where's Agnes?

01:14:20.496 --> 01:14:22.330
<i>Where's Jokul?</i>

01:14:24.266 --> 01:14:25.466
Vali?

01:15:47.716 --> 01:15:50.751
You're a long way from home, Steinar.

01:15:52.354 --> 01:15:54.055
So is he.

01:15:56.658 --> 01:15:58.659
This is his home.

01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:13.707
Our father's dying.

01:16:17.779 --> 01:16:20.347
What do you see...

01:16:23.218 --> 01:16:25.553
when you think of home?

01:16:30.559 --> 01:16:33.127
I think of the...

01:16:33.129 --> 01:16:35.729
the blue of the sky,

01:16:35.731 --> 01:16:38.165
<i>the green
of the forest.</i>

01:16:41.136 --> 01:16:43.137
The smell of the pine trees.

01:16:47.742 --> 01:16:49.777
I see nothing.

01:16:53.515 --> 01:16:55.649
Nothing...

01:16:55.651 --> 01:16:57.751
but darkness.

01:17:09.831 --> 01:17:12.233
Why have you

01:17:12.235 --> 01:17:14.502
come here?

01:17:14.504 --> 01:17:16.370
<i>Our father sent me.</i>

01:17:16.372 --> 01:17:18.139
He sent me to bring you back...

01:17:20.342 --> 01:17:21.809
to lead your people

01:17:24.246 --> 01:17:25.713
as King.

01:17:28.817 --> 01:17:32.553
You don't know what you ask,

01:17:32.555 --> 01:17:35.222
but you will.

01:17:49.638 --> 01:17:52.473
Let the feast begin!

01:18:24.206 --> 01:18:27.675
Friends,

01:18:27.677 --> 01:18:32.713
- this is a momentous day.
- Yeah!

01:18:32.715 --> 01:18:37.818
This is a truly momentous occasion.

01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:41.222
Commence the festivities!

01:18:51.566 --> 01:18:55.436
The people I arrived with--
what happened to them?

01:20:10.011 --> 01:20:12.780
Hey,

01:20:12.782 --> 01:20:15.716
how old were you when Hakan left?

01:20:15.718 --> 01:20:19.353
10, 11.

01:20:19.355 --> 01:20:23.023
Were you never curious as to why?

01:21:02.364 --> 01:21:04.131
I always loved you.

01:21:05.734 --> 01:21:08.435
I never wanted us to be separated.

01:21:10.538 --> 01:21:13.674
No mother would ever wish for such a thing.

01:21:16.611 --> 01:21:18.645
<i>But that's all
going to change now.</i>

01:21:21.950 --> 01:21:24.985
Now is the time for the world

01:21:24.987 --> 01:21:27.154
<i>to bow down
before his might.</i>

01:21:27.156 --> 01:21:29.490
Hakan! Hakan! Hakan!

01:21:29.492 --> 01:21:31.825
<i>All men will bow down before him.</i>

01:21:31.827 --> 01:21:34.027
Hakan! Hakan! Hakan!

01:21:34.029 --> 01:21:37.664
Hakan! Hakan!
Hakan! Hakan!

01:21:40.703 --> 01:21:43.771
Hakan! Hakan!
Hakan! Hakan!

01:21:43.773 --> 01:21:45.572
Bow down before the King!

01:22:22.444 --> 01:22:25.813
Hakan! Hakan! Hakan! Hakan!

01:22:25.815 --> 01:22:28.949
Hakan! Hakan! Hakan! Hakan!

01:23:03.551 --> 01:23:06.253
<i>Bow before him.
Kneel before your King.</i>

01:23:17.265 --> 01:23:19.166
Do you deny him?

01:23:22.604 --> 01:23:24.505
I deny him.

01:24:55.730 --> 01:24:59.166
You dare question your King.

01:24:59.168 --> 01:25:01.802
You dare question your God.

01:25:04.372 --> 01:25:07.040
Now your questions will be answered

01:25:07.042 --> 01:25:09.209
through his immortality...

01:25:15.316 --> 01:25:17.017
...and your destruction.

01:30:42.511 --> 01:30:44.511
Steinar.

01:32:28.349 --> 01:32:29.582
Steinar.

01:32:37.391 --> 01:32:39.692
<i>Well, where's Hakan?</i>

01:32:50.404 --> 01:32:53.106
He was sent to find his brother

01:32:53.108 --> 01:32:56.342
and he returns with his head in a bag.

01:32:56.344 --> 01:32:58.445
He was sent to find the King.

01:33:00.181 --> 01:33:02.315
Looks like he found one.

01:33:03.451 --> 01:33:05.852
How many people do we have in camp?

01:33:05.854 --> 01:33:09.722
600, 650.

01:33:09.724 --> 01:33:12.492
How many more could we muster by the morning?

01:33:12.494 --> 01:33:13.860
A few hundred more.

01:33:16.097 --> 01:33:18.231
And how far away is the saxon army?

01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:25.305
No more than a day's ride.

01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:28.875
Good.

01:33:28.877 --> 01:33:31.211
We leave at first light.

01:33:52.199 --> 01:33:53.700
Open your mouth.

01:34:07.815 --> 01:34:09.716
Swallow it!

01:34:10.305 --> 01:34:16.230
