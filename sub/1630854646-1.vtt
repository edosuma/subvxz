WEBVTT

00:12.804 --> 00:14.348
(crickets chirping)

00:15.057 --> 00:16.642
(deep tense music)

00:23.273 --> 00:24.858
(dogs barking
in distance)

00:29.696 --> 00:31.240
(slow eerie music)

00:42.834 --> 00:44.419
- [Vivian]
Don't worry, Zach.

00:45.295 --> 00:46.880
(slow mysterious
lullaby music)

00:58.517 --> 01:00.018
(Zach coos)

01:00.435 --> 01:02.896
See, Zach,
everything's okay.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.898
Yeah.

01:05.357 --> 01:06.942
(slow mysterious music)

01:18.328 --> 01:19.913
Sh, sh-sh.

01:36.221 --> 01:37.806
(glass shatters)

01:38.348 --> 01:39.933
Aaron?

01:40.934 --> 01:42.185
(glass shatters)

01:42.185 --> 01:43.812
- [Aaron]
Almost done.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.355
(slow mysterious music)

01:58.035 --> 01:59.619
(creature growls)

02:11.715 --> 02:13.300
(slashing)
(Zach squeals, cries)

02:19.348 --> 02:20.974
(mirror shatters)
(haunting music)

02:31.818 --> 02:33.362
- Zach?

02:34.446 --> 02:35.989
(gasps)

02:36.365 --> 02:37.908
Oh, god.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.455
No! (sobbing)

02:44.748 --> 02:47.000
No! (screaming)

02:52.089 --> 02:53.673
(gentle mysterious
lullaby music)

02:58.678 --> 03:00.263
(creaking)

03:15.570 --> 03:17.114
(Papo cooing)

03:28.041 --> 03:29.626
- [John] Opa.

03:30.168 --> 03:31.753
Oh, yeah.

03:32.921 --> 03:35.257
Okay.
Hey.

03:35.257 --> 03:37.801
- [Rachel] There it is,
my little prince,

03:37.801 --> 03:39.344
it's your kingdom.

03:40.345 --> 03:41.972
Here we go.

03:41.972 --> 03:43.515
(gentle inspiring music)

03:56.987 --> 03:59.072
Hey, buddy,
this is your room.

04:01.616 --> 04:03.160
Hm.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.412
(Eli cooing)

04:06.329 --> 04:08.748
Yeah, these are all
your new friends.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.128
You gonna say,
"Hello, jaguar.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.465
Hello,
alligator.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.218
Hello,
giraffe."

04:20.719 --> 04:22.262
Oy.

04:27.058 --> 04:28.602
Asleep.

04:31.146 --> 04:33.607
- You ever have one
of those moments,

04:33.607 --> 04:35.192
just like
you imagined it?

04:36.985 --> 04:38.528
(knocking at door)

04:40.405 --> 04:42.324
- This little kid sleeps
through anything.

04:42.324 --> 04:43.909
(chuckles)

04:49.748 --> 04:51.333
(cooing)

04:53.043 --> 04:55.128
- Hi, uh,
Schoenberg?

04:55.462 --> 04:57.047
- It's Guerrero.

04:58.256 --> 04:59.841
Ah, yeah.

04:59.841 --> 05:02.010
It's my mother-in-law,
that explains it.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.012
Schoenberg's my wife's
maiden name. I can sign.

05:04.012 --> 05:05.555
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.807
- There you go.
- Great. Thank you.

05:08.225 --> 05:09.935
- Oh.

05:09.935 --> 05:11.478
All right.

05:15.273 --> 05:18.276
Hey, Papo,
wanna say hi to baby Eli?

05:19.778 --> 05:21.279
Hey, Papo,
look.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.406
It's your
little brother.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.033
Yeah.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.576
That's Eli.

05:27.285 --> 05:29.162
We gotta look
after him, yeah.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.039
- It was
my sister's stuff.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.917
- Toys that, uh,

05:34.167 --> 05:36.169
belonged
to a baby who...

05:38.171 --> 05:39.714
- Who died.

05:39.714 --> 05:41.883
- I'm not superstitious,
I'm just saying.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.843
You know,
what happened to her son,

05:43.843 --> 05:46.012
and the whole accident
with her husband.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.515
(Papo squawks)
(Eli cries)

05:48.515 --> 05:50.559
What happened?
Papo scare you, huh?

05:50.559 --> 05:53.728
Oh, come on, let's get you
over here, put you down.

05:53.728 --> 05:55.564
Okay?
Yeah.

05:55.564 --> 05:57.357
(Eli cooing)

05:57.357 --> 05:58.984
(ticking clock
echoes)

05:58.984 --> 06:00.777
Papo's a friend, Eli.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.362
It's okay.
(Eli coos)

06:02.362 --> 06:04.322
Yeah, it's all right,
buddy.

06:04.864 --> 06:06.408
(book creaks)

06:09.953 --> 06:11.538
(ticking clock
slows down)

06:19.212 --> 06:21.214
- Got your ear.
- Oh, my god.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.924
- And I

06:22.924 --> 06:24.467
got your nose.

06:27.053 --> 06:28.597
- Look at this.

06:29.264 --> 06:30.849
It's got
writing on it.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.727
It's got music.

06:35.312 --> 06:36.896
It's Hebrew.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.566
All right, Hebrew school,
let's put you to work.

06:40.317 --> 06:42.360
(John chuckles)
- Got jokes, all right.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.321
- Yeah, come on.
See what you got.

06:44.321 --> 06:45.905
- Um...

06:47.907 --> 06:49.451
(John speaks Hebrew)

06:51.828 --> 06:54.331
It's like a prayer,
but not.

06:54.331 --> 06:55.665
Hm.

06:55.665 --> 06:58.460
Hang on, I got-I got
something for that.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.045
(Papo squawking)

07:00.545 --> 07:01.963
- That's good.

07:01.963 --> 07:03.798
You need
a cheat sheet.

07:03.798 --> 07:05.842
See, you probably don't
even speak Hebrew.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.385
I think I need to
call my mother.

07:07.385 --> 07:10.263
- Wow, wow, I mean, I think
what you mean to say is

07:10.263 --> 07:12.766
thank you, my love, for getting
my mother off our backs

07:12.766 --> 07:15.268
and proving your undying love
for me and Judaism

07:15.268 --> 07:16.811
by converting,
maybe?

07:16.811 --> 07:18.855
- Thank you, my love.
- Mm-hm.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.815
- What was it again?
- Mm-hm.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.652
Ah, look,
here it is.

07:23.652 --> 07:25.278
It's a zemer.
Yeah.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.738
- Right.

07:26.738 --> 07:28.281
(clears throat)
It's a zemer.

07:28.281 --> 07:32.952
- Mm-hm, zemer, it's like
a hymn, a religious song,

07:32.952 --> 07:34.621
also like a lullaby.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.540
It's actually
beautiful.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.335
- It's classic Vivian.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.588
- Can you make out
the tune?

07:44.714 --> 07:46.299
- Um...

07:47.342 --> 07:48.927
(Rachel vocalizing)

07:58.895 --> 08:00.438
(telephone rings)

08:02.524 --> 08:04.359
Okay, we don't need
a lullaby.

08:04.943 --> 08:06.486
(telephone rings)

08:07.278 --> 08:08.863
Hello.

08:08.863 --> 08:10.281
Thank you.

08:10.281 --> 08:12.784
Yeah, he came out so cute,
the little munchkin.

08:12.784 --> 08:14.369
I can't even
tell you,

08:14.369 --> 08:16.121
he's like
a perfect little soufflé.

08:16.121 --> 08:18.748
Um, hey,
so, right...

08:18.748 --> 08:20.333
Where are we on
reservations?

08:20.333 --> 08:21.918
(gentle somber music)

08:25.505 --> 08:27.257
You think this
is too easy?

08:28.842 --> 08:30.385
- We got this.

08:32.679 --> 08:36.015
- You know, I bet I won't
even need the full month.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.903
(Eli crying)

08:52.907 --> 08:54.451
- Oh.

08:54.451 --> 08:56.036
(Eli crying)

08:57.370 --> 08:58.913
(car horns honk)

08:59.456 --> 09:01.041
(Eli crying)

09:04.210 --> 09:06.004
- Please, Eli,
just work it out.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.548
- Okay, I'll take him
so you can, uh, get ready.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.758
Come on,
buddy.

09:09.758 --> 09:11.551
I'm, oh, let me
get this first.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.511
- I know. I know.
- There we go.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.388
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, okay.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.098
All right now.

09:17.098 --> 09:18.641
(Eli crying)

09:20.018 --> 09:21.728
- Yeah.
- I can't do this.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.897
I can't-- Look at me,
I'm a freaking mess.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.983
I can't, I can't,
I can't go in like this.

09:27.317 --> 09:30.653
I've had, what,
45 minutes sleep this week?

09:30.653 --> 09:33.156
- Okay, all right.
- I can't, I can't do it.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.699
- How can
I help?

09:36.493 --> 09:39.370
- I don't know.
The restaurant was also my baby.

09:39.370 --> 09:40.914
(Eli fussing)

09:42.999 --> 09:45.543
I just feel like it's
slipping through my fingers.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.128
(Eli fussing)

09:47.796 --> 09:49.422
- Okay.
(Eli coughing)

09:49.422 --> 09:50.757
Okay. Okay.
Up, up.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.342
- Oh.
- Up, up, up.

09:52.342 --> 09:53.885
- Hey.
- Rach, love,

09:55.220 --> 09:57.222
I saw you build
that restaurant, okay?

09:57.222 --> 09:58.765
- Yeah.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.392
- It's not
going anywhere, okay?

10:01.392 --> 10:03.061
- I know.
- You're amazing.

10:03.061 --> 10:05.814
- Well, I'm amazing at that
'cause I know how to do it.

10:05.814 --> 10:07.565
I just, I don't
know how to do this

10:07.565 --> 10:09.776
and that
at the same time.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.986
(Eli fussing)

10:13.488 --> 10:15.073
- I have no doubt.

10:15.490 --> 10:17.116
(Rachel sighs)

10:17.116 --> 10:18.660
Oh.

10:19.452 --> 10:22.580
Okay, look, um,
I'll call the gallery.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.666
I'll tell the guys,
oh, you got my--

10:24.666 --> 10:26.125
did you get
my nose now?

10:26.125 --> 10:27.794
I'll let them know
that I'm gonna stay home.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.254
- I'm not even gonna--
- It'll be me and you.

10:29.254 --> 10:31.089
- No. No.
- Yeah, me and Eli.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.465
- No, no,
you can't.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.843
This is your biggest
exhibition ever, baby.

10:34.843 --> 10:35.927
- Oh.
(Eli cries)

10:35.927 --> 10:37.470
- You gotta go
to the gallery

10:37.470 --> 10:40.181
and make sure your
psychedelic chicken is on point.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.725
- It's a phoenix.

10:44.227 --> 10:45.645
- Well, you know,
at least one of us

10:45.645 --> 10:47.730
can rise from the ashes.
(John chuckles)

10:47.730 --> 10:49.148
I'm gonna
stay with you.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.775
- We're gonna work it out.
- Yeah? You sure?

10:50.775 --> 10:52.402
- I got pretty close to getting
out the door today, buddy.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.237
- You did. You certainly did.
- I did. I got close.

10:54.237 --> 10:55.697
- I did.
- You'll need that.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.824
- We're gonna
work it out, buddy.

10:57.824 --> 11:00.201
Get outta here. Get out
before it's too late.

11:00.201 --> 11:01.536
- Okay.
- Hi.

11:01.536 --> 11:03.955
- All right, we a team,
we a team, we a team.

11:03.955 --> 11:06.291
- We a team, we a team.
Yeah, we totally a team.

11:06.291 --> 11:07.917
We got it.
Oh, god.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.502
(Eli crying)
Yeah.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.547
I, uh, I thought we agreed
on white truffles.

11:12.547 --> 11:14.132
- [Woman On Phone]
What?

11:14.132 --> 11:15.466
- On white truffles.
Sh, sh.

11:15.466 --> 11:18.469
Yep, but you're still
gonna sit down.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.013
You can
cry about it.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.307
Hi.
Hey, baby.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.935
Oh, this one, oh, look,
it's fun, it's fun.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.520
Be happy.
(Eli cries)

11:29.939 --> 11:31.524
Look, look
at the bird.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.902
Look at the bird.
Yeah.

11:34.235 --> 11:35.778
(Papo squawks)

11:36.362 --> 11:37.906
(Eli cries)

11:41.993 --> 11:43.328
It's okay.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.537
Look.
(clapping)

11:44.537 --> 11:46.998
You wanna clap?
You wanna do this?

11:47.582 --> 11:49.751
I just need
five minutes, okay?

11:49.751 --> 11:51.252
Okay?

11:51.252 --> 11:53.671
You're a good guy.
Yeah.

11:53.671 --> 11:55.381
You're a good guy.

11:55.381 --> 11:56.841
(Eli cries)

11:56.841 --> 11:59.469
Please,
I just need to poop.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.471
Eli.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.014
(Eli cries)

12:06.935 --> 12:08.895
No, don't eat that,
don't eat that.

12:09.354 --> 12:11.439
No, don't eat that.
No.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.524
That's right.

12:13.942 --> 12:15.568
We're gonna--
Oh.

12:17.028 --> 12:18.571
Okay.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.448
Okay,
we've got this.

12:21.157 --> 12:22.700
Clean?

12:22.700 --> 12:24.827
Vivian, Vivian.
Vivian?

12:25.787 --> 12:27.372
Oh, Vivian.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.333
Thank you,
sis.

12:30.333 --> 12:31.834
Gold up in here.
(Eli cries)

12:31.834 --> 12:33.419
There's some gold
up in here.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.171
What is that?
Look, what's that?

12:35.171 --> 12:36.714
(Eli wailing)

12:38.341 --> 12:39.884
(wailing continues)

12:48.851 --> 12:50.436
Stopped crying.

12:51.312 --> 12:52.855
It works.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.440
(Eli fusses)

12:55.108 --> 12:57.068
Is that a little bit
of drool?

12:59.821 --> 13:01.614
(foot thuds)

13:02.782 --> 13:04.367
(soft eerie music)

13:11.040 --> 13:14.002
(indistinct
distant whispering)

13:23.469 --> 13:25.054
Oh...

13:25.054 --> 13:26.639
Johnny.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.182
(Eli crying)

13:31.144 --> 13:32.687
(Papo squawks)

13:33.312 --> 13:34.856
(Eli crying)

13:37.150 --> 13:38.693
Sh, sh, sh.

13:48.619 --> 13:50.163
(Rachel sings softly)

13:53.583 --> 13:55.126
(Eli stops crying)

13:58.713 --> 14:00.298
(Eli cries)

14:03.634 --> 14:05.178
(Rachel sings softly)

14:09.766 --> 14:11.350
(Eli stops crying)

14:20.902 --> 14:22.528
(mirror cracks)

14:22.528 --> 14:24.072

14:25.656 --> 14:27.200
(mirror cracks)

14:31.204 --> 14:32.789
(crickets chirping)

14:54.060 --> 14:55.603
Baby,

14:55.812 --> 14:57.396
you did it.

14:59.524 --> 15:01.067
I love you
so much.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.744
(wind howling)

15:14.747 --> 15:16.332
(ghostly voices whisper)

15:20.586 --> 15:22.130
(door latch opens)

15:22.130 --> 15:23.756
(John sighs)

15:30.763 --> 15:32.557
Hey, honey.

15:33.558 --> 15:35.101
Can you
hear that?

15:38.563 --> 15:40.106
- I hear...

15:40.940 --> 15:42.567
absolutely nothing.

15:42.567 --> 15:43.901
- Not a peep.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.611
Not a snort.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.364
Not for hours.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.200
(John sighs)

15:51.200 --> 15:52.785
It was
the lullaby.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.954
- Ah, your, uh,
your sister's book.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.372
- Mm-hm.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.291
- So, you were able to read
my translations?

15:58.291 --> 15:59.792
- Mm-hm.

15:59.792 --> 16:03.129
It, I don't know,
it put him right to sleep.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.339
(both sigh)

16:06.465 --> 16:08.009
- Thank you.

16:08.009 --> 16:11.179
- How is this even possible?
You just got in the door.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.140
- Ah, baby puke.

16:14.891 --> 16:16.475
It's inevitable.

16:18.769 --> 16:20.313
(towel snaps)

16:22.607 --> 16:24.025
Hmm.

16:24.025 --> 16:25.610
(gentle mysterious
lullaby music)

16:28.988 --> 16:30.573
(zipper opens)

16:31.324 --> 16:34.577
Oh, uh,
your dress is unzipped.

16:34.577 --> 16:36.120
- Really?

16:36.787 --> 16:38.331
Oops.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.376

lullaby music)

16:51.552 --> 16:53.137

(Papo squawking)

19:01.807 --> 19:03.476

19:03.476 --> 19:04.810
John?

ratcheting)

19:41.222 --> 19:42.932
(Rachel gasps)

19:42.932 --> 19:44.475
Fuck this.

19:49.146 --> 19:50.731
(mirror cracking)

19:59.156 --> 20:00.741
(soft eerie music)

20:10.876 --> 20:12.420
(Rachel groans)

20:16.006 --> 20:17.550
Mom face.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.053
Great.

(water splashing)

20:45.536 --> 20:47.121
(shower door opens)

20:49.123 --> 20:50.708
Guess who's
still asleep?

20:52.126 --> 20:54.086
- Elias Samson Guerrero?

20:54.420 --> 20:55.963
- Yep.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.840
- What a
good boy.

20:59.300 --> 21:00.885
- Yeah.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.894
(Crone growls)
- Shit!

21:09.894 --> 21:11.604
(scary music)

21:17.985 --> 21:19.528
Rach.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.323
Rach.

21:22.323 --> 21:23.908
- It's fine.

21:24.241 --> 21:26.577
(sighs)
- Look, I'm sorry. I saw--

21:26.577 --> 21:29.789
- You don't have to apologize.
You had an honest reaction,

21:29.789 --> 21:32.333
that's just life.
It's what happens.

21:32.333 --> 21:33.959
- Hey, no,
look--

21:33.959 --> 21:35.503
Wait a minute.

21:35.503 --> 21:37.087
- We need
a new baby monitor.

21:37.087 --> 21:38.631
I'm gonna
be back soon.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.553
(door shuts)

21:44.970 --> 21:46.514
- Hey, Papo.

21:47.389 --> 21:49.016
Hey, buddy.
(Papo squawks)

21:49.016 --> 21:50.476
Hi.

21:50.476 --> 21:52.019
Yeah.

21:52.019 --> 21:53.562
Hey.

21:53.896 --> 21:55.773
How you doin', bud? Yeah.

21:56.899 --> 21:58.859
I know.
Yeah, hello.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.946
You're not mad at me,
are you?

22:05.533 --> 22:07.159
Look at yourself.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.702
(Papo squawks)

22:08.702 --> 22:10.246
(speaks Spanish)

22:10.663 --> 22:12.206
(Papo squawks)

22:16.043 --> 22:17.586
What is that?

22:17.586 --> 22:19.171
(Papo squawks)

22:20.297 --> 22:21.924
Huh.

22:21.924 --> 22:23.467
(people chattering)

22:34.979 --> 22:36.522

(monitors crackling)

22:46.949 --> 22:48.492
(echoing knock)

22:52.413 --> 22:54.123
- Okay, let's
get outta here.

22:54.665 --> 22:56.208
Hello?

22:56.959 --> 22:58.502
(Rachel breathes heavily)

23:02.089 --> 23:03.382
(scary music)

23:03.382 --> 23:04.967
(Rachel cries out)

23:05.593 --> 23:07.344
- Are you okay?

23:15.978 --> 23:17.521
(haunting music)

23:22.568 --> 23:24.153
(mirror cracking)

23:26.947 --> 23:28.490
(Papo yells)

23:29.992 --> 23:31.493
(thunder claps)

23:31.910 --> 23:33.871
- Stupid bird,
I swear to you...

23:37.374 --> 23:38.959
(Papo squawking)

23:44.506 --> 23:46.467
I'm gonna make a pillow
outta you.

23:47.009 --> 23:48.552
(Papo squawking)

23:49.678 --> 23:51.263
(baby cries
in distance)

23:53.015 --> 23:54.558
(thunder crashes)

23:58.520 --> 24:00.105
(electricity buzzes)

24:00.773 --> 24:02.358

24:02.358 --> 24:04.151
(panting)

24:08.906 --> 24:10.491

24:11.367 --> 24:12.951
(baby crying)

24:34.139 --> 24:35.683

25:27.818 --> 25:30.237
(scary boom)
(Rachel gasps)

25:33.532 --> 25:35.117
- Hey. Hey.

25:36.285 --> 25:38.996
Hey, what-what's wrong?
What happened? What happened?

25:38.996 --> 25:40.706
- There's, I think
there's someone,

25:40.706 --> 25:42.332
there's someone in
the apartment. I--

25:42.332 --> 25:44.168
- What do you--
what do you mean?

25:44.168 --> 25:46.128
- So, so, okay, so there
was a blackout,

25:46.128 --> 25:47.880
and then I--

25:49.047 --> 25:51.675
There, I think there's
something or someone, I--

25:51.675 --> 25:53.302
- Did you
call the police?

25:53.302 --> 25:55.304
- No, I didn't.
I-- I didn't.

25:56.221 --> 25:57.765
(thunder claps)

26:00.476 --> 26:02.060
(Papo squawking)

26:04.646 --> 26:06.231

26:09.610 --> 26:11.195
(Papo talks indistinctly)

26:24.750 --> 26:26.335
- Hello?
- [Papo] Hello.

26:28.921 --> 26:30.464
(Papo squawking)

26:48.065 --> 26:49.608
(thunder crackles)

26:54.029 --> 26:56.698
- If someone's in here,
come out.

26:58.534 --> 27:00.160
(metal rattles)

27:00.160 --> 27:01.703
Hey!

27:01.703 --> 27:03.288
(Papo squawks)

27:09.711 --> 27:11.463
(thunder crashes)

27:11.463 --> 27:13.590
- [Rachel]
Baby, is everything okay?

27:16.885 --> 27:18.428
- Yeah.

27:18.846 --> 27:20.430
Stay in the hall.

27:21.098 --> 27:22.683
(Papo squawking)
(thunder rumbles)

27:55.799 --> 27:57.384
(John breathing heavily)

28:02.723 --> 28:04.349
(Papo squawks)
(John grunts)

28:04.349 --> 28:05.809
(Papo thuds)

28:05.809 --> 28:07.394
(John gasps)

28:08.395 --> 28:09.938
Oh, god.

28:11.148 --> 28:12.691
Oh, shit, no.

28:15.986 --> 28:17.571
No, Papo.
No, no, no.

28:19.406 --> 28:21.450
Papo.
No.

28:21.783 --> 28:23.535
My mom got him
for me.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.413
Had him
since I was 11.

28:32.628 --> 28:35.881
- I'm so sorry, baby.
I'm so sorry.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.133
I'm so sorry.

28:38.133 --> 28:39.676
- Don't be.

28:41.511 --> 28:43.055
It's not
your fault.

28:44.139 --> 28:45.682
I did it.

28:45.682 --> 28:47.267
(eerie music)

28:49.478 --> 28:51.021
(John sighs)

29:01.740 --> 29:03.325
- I, I'm...

29:05.619 --> 29:07.204
I'm not okay.

29:08.956 --> 29:12.334
I'm trying really,
really hard to be okay,

29:12.334 --> 29:15.712
but I think I'm not okay,
I think I'm...

29:17.798 --> 29:20.217
I think I'm actually
losing my mind.

29:21.551 --> 29:23.470
I mean,
Vivian lost her mind,

29:23.470 --> 29:24.930
she tucked
her dead baby

29:24.930 --> 29:26.431
into his crib for,
like, two weeks.

29:26.431 --> 29:28.934
- Rach, you're not Vivian,
okay?

29:31.061 --> 29:32.646
You know,
we're just...

29:33.397 --> 29:34.940
stressed.

29:35.983 --> 29:37.859
Parents of a
newborn baby.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.780
- I'm seeing things.

29:47.494 --> 29:49.830
I'm seeing
this woman,

29:49.830 --> 29:51.415
this old,

29:51.915 --> 29:54.626
hag witch woman

29:54.626 --> 29:57.004
in the darkness,
in the mirror,

29:57.004 --> 30:00.173
in the freaking baby store.
I'm going--

30:00.173 --> 30:01.717
(chair clatters)

30:06.013 --> 30:08.557
Well, I suppose,
wife's going bat-shit crazy,

30:08.557 --> 30:10.142
that's how
I'd react too.

30:11.893 --> 30:13.478
- No, Rach,

30:13.478 --> 30:15.439
you are not
going crazy.

30:17.232 --> 30:19.317
Did you see--
Is that what you saw?

30:19.317 --> 30:20.861
Did you see
something like that?

30:20.861 --> 30:23.113
- That's her. That's her.
- Yeah, okay.

30:23.864 --> 30:25.574
The other morning,
in the shower,

30:26.241 --> 30:28.201
same creepy image
got in my head.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.205
- Right.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.210
So, we're just,
what, like...

30:40.505 --> 30:42.049
sleep-deprived,

30:42.966 --> 30:45.010
freaking
cabin fever--

30:45.469 --> 30:47.012
- Yeah,
probably.

30:47.971 --> 30:49.681
Most likely.
Yeah.

30:52.059 --> 30:54.019
- But that's
not what you believe.

30:55.979 --> 30:57.606
No, you, no.

30:57.606 --> 30:59.941
We're seeing...
Come on, we're seeing--

30:59.941 --> 31:03.111
- Look, Rach, I believe in us.
Okay, that's all.

31:03.111 --> 31:05.113
Whatever this is,
whatever's happening,

31:05.614 --> 31:07.199
we're gonna
get through this.

31:07.199 --> 31:08.742
Together, okay?

31:09.159 --> 31:10.911
We a team.

31:13.580 --> 31:15.207
- Yeah.

31:15.207 --> 31:16.750
Yeah,
we a team.

31:17.209 --> 31:19.669
- Yeah, and this is going
where it belongs.

31:19.669 --> 31:21.213
- Yeah.

31:23.090 --> 31:24.800
And Eli's sleeping
with us tonight.

31:27.511 --> 31:29.054
(baby crying)

31:36.686 --> 31:38.230
- Baby's crying.

31:41.108 --> 31:42.734
(John sighs)

31:42.734 --> 31:44.277
I'll get it.

31:44.778 --> 31:46.696
I'll get it.
You sleep.

31:46.696 --> 31:48.281
(tense suspenseful music)

31:48.281 --> 31:49.825
(baby crying)

32:08.260 --> 32:09.845
Okay.
Okay, buddy.

32:11.429 --> 32:12.973
(door closes)

32:17.310 --> 32:18.854
(baby crying)

32:22.524 --> 32:24.067
I'm comin', Eli.

32:25.402 --> 32:26.945
I'm comin'.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.532
(baby crying)

32:34.703 --> 32:36.246
(door slams shut)

32:37.122 --> 32:38.707
(baby crying)

32:40.000 --> 32:41.626
Eli?

32:41.626 --> 32:43.170
(baby crying)

32:48.008 --> 32:50.177
Eli?
Eli!

32:50.177 --> 32:51.803
(baby crying)

32:55.015 --> 32:56.641
What the...?

32:56.641 --> 32:58.185
(baby stops crying)

33:01.938 --> 33:03.523
- Hey, hey!
(scary bang)

33:03.523 --> 33:05.108
You steal
from me, man.

33:06.860 --> 33:08.445
That's bad karma,
man.

33:08.445 --> 33:10.989
(door clicks open)
That's bad juju!

33:10.989 --> 33:12.574
(door clicks shut)

33:13.200 --> 33:14.826
(slow mysterious music)

33:50.570 --> 33:52.113
(Eli crying)

33:52.113 --> 33:54.366
- Hey, do you have
an alarm snooze--

33:54.366 --> 33:56.868
snooze button
here?

33:56.868 --> 33:58.411
(Eli crying)

34:01.039 --> 34:02.624
(Rachel sings softly)

34:05.919 --> 34:07.504
(ghostly voice echoes)

34:15.345 --> 34:16.930
(Rachel sings softly)

34:20.225 --> 34:22.435
(ghostly voice echoes)

34:23.561 --> 34:25.105
(eerie music)

34:33.822 --> 34:35.365
Eli?

34:36.199 --> 34:37.826
(baby crying)

34:37.826 --> 34:39.577
Eli?

34:40.328 --> 34:41.913
Eli?

34:41.913 --> 34:43.498
Eli?

34:43.498 --> 34:45.041
(baby crying)

34:46.459 --> 34:48.420
Eli, Eli.

34:50.338 --> 34:52.007
Eli.
(scary whooshing)

34:52.007 --> 34:53.633
(baby cries)

34:55.385 --> 34:56.928
Eli.

34:58.013 --> 34:59.639
(baby crying)

34:59.639 --> 35:01.182
Eli.

35:03.977 --> 35:05.729
(scary music)
(Rachel screams)

35:07.230 --> 35:08.815
(panting)

35:16.114 --> 35:17.699
(Rachel gasps loudly)

35:17.699 --> 35:20.368
My baby, my baby,
my baby.

35:22.329 --> 35:23.955
(Rachel laughs
with relief)

35:28.126 --> 35:29.878
Yeah.

35:30.795 --> 35:32.339
- Yeah.

35:32.339 --> 35:33.965
- You gonna be
okay?

35:33.965 --> 35:35.550
- Absolutely.

35:35.550 --> 35:37.218
We're long overdue

35:37.218 --> 35:39.888
for some father-son
bonding time anyway, right?

35:42.640 --> 35:44.142
In the meantime,

35:44.684 --> 35:47.187
Eli, he says he wants you
to relax, okay?

35:49.981 --> 35:51.566
- Okay.
Thanks Eli.

35:52.317 --> 35:54.277
- All right, bud,
here we go.

35:54.277 --> 35:55.862
Opa. (sighs)

35:57.572 --> 35:59.157
- Let me
get that.

36:01.201 --> 36:02.786
Okay.
I love you.

36:03.119 --> 36:04.704
- I love you more.

36:05.455 --> 36:06.998
Bye.

36:20.220 --> 36:22.514
(slow haunting music)

36:41.324 --> 36:42.909
- Hi.
- Hello.

36:42.909 --> 36:45.036
- Vivian Brown, please.
I'm her sister.

36:48.331 --> 36:49.916
(birds chirping)

36:52.961 --> 36:54.504
(door clicks open)

37:14.274 --> 37:16.317
- Hey, John.

37:17.694 --> 37:21.072
And the
little monster. Hi.

37:21.531 --> 37:23.533
Hey. Hi.
(laughs)

37:27.454 --> 37:29.038
What's happened?

37:29.539 --> 37:31.124
(exhales sharply)

37:32.000 --> 37:33.543
Do Jews
have exorcists?

37:39.841 --> 37:41.885
- Come.
Sit.

37:42.385 --> 37:43.970
(slow somber music)

37:44.804 --> 37:46.347
(John sighs)

37:49.058 --> 37:50.602
(birds chirping)

37:54.981 --> 37:56.524
- Hey, Viv.

37:56.941 --> 37:58.485
(slow somber music)

38:04.157 --> 38:05.742
- Hi, Rachel.

38:06.701 --> 38:08.495
- Can I sit?
- Of course.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.915
- Rachel's sister,

38:11.915 --> 38:13.458
Vivian,

38:15.877 --> 38:17.837
came to me
with the same story,

38:18.796 --> 38:20.340
the same questions.

38:20.340 --> 38:22.133
- Vivian did?

38:23.301 --> 38:25.345
What did
you tell her?

38:27.805 --> 38:29.349
(scoffs)

38:30.808 --> 38:32.393
You thought
she was crazy.

38:34.812 --> 38:37.357
- Mom sent your stuff,
from storage.

38:38.650 --> 38:41.611
- No. No, no. No, no.
I locked that stuff up.

38:41.611 --> 38:43.112
Mom--

38:43.112 --> 38:44.781
Mama should not
have done that.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.033
- I found
the lullaby book.

38:49.452 --> 38:51.162
- Did you
sing from it?

38:54.165 --> 38:56.376
Rachel,
listen to me.

38:56.376 --> 38:57.961
Zachary
was taken.

38:59.170 --> 39:01.172
I sang that song,
and she came

39:01.839 --> 39:03.424
and she took him.

39:05.885 --> 39:07.470
- Who came?

39:09.514 --> 39:11.391
Who is she?

39:11.391 --> 39:12.976
- Lilith.

39:13.726 --> 39:15.270
- Lilith

39:15.270 --> 39:16.896
was the
first woman

39:18.690 --> 39:21.067
made by God
to be Adam's wife.

39:21.818 --> 39:23.403
- They would
lie together

39:23.403 --> 39:24.904
in Eden,

39:24.904 --> 39:26.864
and he would
sing her a song.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.783
It was their
special song.

39:28.783 --> 39:30.577
And whenever Lilith
heard that song

39:30.577 --> 39:32.203
she'd come
running.

39:32.203 --> 39:33.746
She loved Adam,

39:33.746 --> 39:37.000
but she was a strong woman
and she refused to submit.

39:38.501 --> 39:40.086
- The legend says

39:40.086 --> 39:42.922
she was banished
from the Garden of Eden by God.

39:42.922 --> 39:44.507
She roamed
the wilderness.

39:45.216 --> 39:46.801
She lay
with wolves.

39:51.264 --> 39:54.767
And gave birth to her own race
of imperfect creations.

39:56.728 --> 39:58.271
- Deformed,

39:58.271 --> 40:00.356
hungry, half human,
half--

40:00.857 --> 40:02.400
half something else.

40:06.946 --> 40:10.658
Lilith saw Adam and Eve
and their perfect babies,

40:10.658 --> 40:13.161
and then she looked
at her own broken children.

40:13.161 --> 40:15.413
And that's when she started
stealing their children.

40:16.164 --> 40:17.707
Our children.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.337
- And so it went
for generations,

40:22.712 --> 40:24.297
until God listened

40:24.297 --> 40:26.007
to the prayers
of Adam's progeny,

40:27.425 --> 40:29.010
and he sent her

40:29.719 --> 40:31.220
to the
underworld.

40:31.220 --> 40:34.599
- You know the word lullaby
comes from Lilith-abi.

40:35.808 --> 40:37.727
It means
"Lilith begone."

40:39.395 --> 40:42.523
Mothers sing lullabies
to keep Lilith away.

40:43.566 --> 40:45.151
But Lilith,
(chuckles)

40:45.485 --> 40:47.820
Lilith took her
and Adam's song,

40:48.821 --> 40:50.365
their special song,

40:50.823 --> 40:52.367
and she
twisted it.

40:52.867 --> 40:55.662
She turned it into a lullaby
that does the opposite.

40:57.080 --> 40:58.623
It summons her.

41:02.669 --> 41:04.295
I sang
that song,

41:05.296 --> 41:07.006
and she came.

41:10.677 --> 41:13.304
She took
my Zachary,

41:14.305 --> 41:16.599
and that corpse
they found

41:16.599 --> 41:19.727
that had been dead
for who knows how long, that--

41:21.479 --> 41:23.606
that was not
my son.

41:26.859 --> 41:28.444
I can help you,
Rachel.

41:28.444 --> 41:30.029
I can help Eli.

41:30.697 --> 41:32.323
I need
to help Eli.

41:34.951 --> 41:36.494
- How?

41:37.537 --> 41:40.331
- You have to get me
the fuck outta here.

41:42.041 --> 41:44.919
- Rabbi, this woman,
Lilith--

41:45.336 --> 41:46.921
- She's a myth.

41:46.921 --> 41:49.257
What I'm telling you
are legends,

41:49.257 --> 41:51.259
fables used for lessons
and guidance.

41:51.259 --> 41:53.469
- Yeah, I know,
that's why I'm here.

41:53.803 --> 41:56.347
Lilith, she's in your stories,
your fables.

41:56.347 --> 41:57.932
(scoffs)

41:57.932 --> 42:00.810
I'm telling you,
something's happening.

42:00.810 --> 42:02.812
- And I wanna help.
- Then help.

42:03.438 --> 42:04.981
There has to be
something.

42:05.314 --> 42:08.359
A-a-a prayer you can give me.
I don't know, something.

42:08.359 --> 42:09.694
- That isn't
how our religion works.

42:09.694 --> 42:11.028
- Is this
what you told Vivian

42:11.028 --> 42:12.447
when she came to you
looking for answers?

42:12.447 --> 42:14.407
- There was nothing
I could do.

42:20.496 --> 42:22.123
(Rabbi Simowitz sighs)

42:22.123 --> 42:23.666
(John sighs)

42:29.922 --> 42:31.466
(eerie music)

42:36.512 --> 42:38.139
(music fades out)

42:38.139 --> 42:39.682
- Rach,
we're home.

42:40.975 --> 42:42.477
Hey, bud.

42:42.935 --> 42:45.730
What do you say
we get out of that, huh?

42:46.105 --> 42:48.733
And now we go
opa.

42:49.275 --> 42:51.819
Oh, yeah, we're not gonna forget
this thing, right?

42:51.819 --> 42:53.404
Yeah.
(chuckles)

42:54.405 --> 42:56.532
Yeah, huh?
Rach?

42:57.200 --> 42:58.743
(water splattering)

43:01.996 --> 43:03.414
Shit.

43:04.373 --> 43:07.043
Okay, buddy, I need you
to hang here, okay?

43:07.043 --> 43:09.754
Opa. There we go.
You have the toy.

43:10.421 --> 43:11.964
Okay?
Just for second.

43:13.174 --> 43:14.717
Shit.

43:18.179 --> 43:19.722
Shit.

43:20.515 --> 43:22.099
(faucet squeaks)

43:24.852 --> 43:26.437
(door bangs shut)

43:27.438 --> 43:28.981
(deep foreboding music)

43:35.279 --> 43:36.823
(Eli babbling)

43:41.786 --> 43:43.371
(Quad Lilim gurgling)

43:46.207 --> 43:47.750
(Eli giggles)

43:53.172 --> 43:54.715
(Eli babbles)

43:57.510 --> 43:59.095
(Quad Lilim grunts)

44:01.764 --> 44:03.599
(Eli giggles)

44:04.475 --> 44:06.018
(glass shatters)

44:06.018 --> 44:07.562
Shit.

44:07.562 --> 44:09.146
(water splattering)

44:12.233 --> 44:13.776
(soft haunting music)

44:19.782 --> 44:21.367
(glass clinks)

44:25.872 --> 44:27.498
(dramatic boom)

44:31.502 --> 44:33.087
(tense music)

44:37.550 --> 44:39.135
(Eli screams)

44:41.721 --> 44:43.681
- What, you just--
you left him?

44:43.681 --> 44:45.099
- What?

44:45.099 --> 44:46.976
No, I just-I just put him down
for a second.

44:46.976 --> 44:48.561
The-the bathroom...

44:49.145 --> 44:50.688
Is he okay?

44:54.066 --> 44:55.610
Vivian.

44:56.569 --> 44:58.195
- They're here.

44:58.195 --> 44:59.739
(eerie music)

45:03.701 --> 45:05.286
Lilith's servants.

45:06.996 --> 45:08.915
We cover mirrors
after funerals

45:08.915 --> 45:11.083
so our departed loved ones
don't stare at us

45:11.083 --> 45:12.627
from the
afterlife.

45:13.002 --> 45:14.545
So it is
with Lilith.

45:14.879 --> 45:17.006
I thought that
breaking the mirrors would work,

45:17.006 --> 45:18.591
but this
is better.

45:18.591 --> 45:20.176
This is right.

45:21.594 --> 45:23.179
- Right.

45:33.856 --> 45:36.609
- Isn't she supposed to be
in the psych ward?

45:36.609 --> 45:38.194
- Maybe.

45:38.194 --> 45:39.820
- [John] So you thought
it was a good idea

45:39.820 --> 45:41.405
to bring
your crazy sister here?

45:41.405 --> 45:43.115
- [Rachel] Don't talk
about her like that.

45:43.115 --> 45:46.118
- [John] Maybe this wasn't a
fire that needs gasoline, Rach.

45:46.118 --> 45:47.662
- [Rachel] I just
thought after everything

45:47.662 --> 45:49.997
we've been through
and experienced and, you know,

45:49.997 --> 45:51.582
the book
was hers.

45:51.582 --> 45:53.417
She-she-she
lost it.

45:53.417 --> 45:55.169
- Exactly.
She lost.

45:55.169 --> 45:57.380
She lost her baby.
She lost her husband.

45:57.380 --> 45:58.673
She lost
her mind.

45:58.673 --> 46:00.383
- I didn't
lose my baby.

46:00.800 --> 46:03.177
That thing we buried
was not my child.

46:04.095 --> 46:06.097
Lilith took
my little boy

46:06.806 --> 46:08.599
and her Crone
killed my husband.

46:09.600 --> 46:11.602
- I thought
a mirror fell on him.

46:11.602 --> 46:14.271
- You don't have the
luxury of skepticism, John.

46:14.271 --> 46:15.982
Not anymore.

46:15.982 --> 46:17.566
You sang
her song,

46:17.817 --> 46:19.777
and now
she is coming for Eli.

46:20.403 --> 46:21.821
- What's
the plan here?

46:21.821 --> 46:24.824
I mean, but how--
how do we protect our son?

46:25.199 --> 46:26.993
- Don't take your eyes
off him.

46:26.993 --> 46:28.703
And if you see
her Crone,

46:29.203 --> 46:30.746
run.

46:31.288 --> 46:32.832
(telephone rings)

46:35.042 --> 46:36.627
Come with me.

46:38.462 --> 46:40.006
Let's finish.

46:42.383 --> 46:43.926
- Hello?

46:43.926 --> 46:46.721
- [Man On Phone] I understand
you have a book.

46:48.806 --> 46:50.391
- Who is this?

46:51.058 --> 46:54.145
- [Man On Phone] Your rabbi said
you need help, John.

46:55.980 --> 46:57.565
Get a pen.

47:00.067 --> 47:01.652
- You're leaving?

47:01.861 --> 47:03.821
- There's something
I have to do.

47:04.947 --> 47:06.907
- Don't worry.
We'll keep Eli safe.

47:09.076 --> 47:10.870
(Elevator arrival chime)

47:14.999 --> 47:16.584
(engages lock)

47:31.390 --> 47:33.392
I see congratulations
are in order.

47:36.520 --> 47:38.189
- With everything
going on, I...

47:38.189 --> 47:40.149
I don't think
I've even told Johnny.

47:41.358 --> 47:42.902
That came
so easy.

47:43.861 --> 47:45.446
(Eli fusses)

47:46.489 --> 47:48.032
- What is it?

47:48.032 --> 47:51.035
- No, this thought just
comes into my head sometimes.

47:54.121 --> 47:56.499
I don't even wanna
say it out loud.

47:56.499 --> 47:58.292
It's a horrible,
horrible thought.

48:07.384 --> 48:09.970
What if this is the
universe's way of telling me

48:09.970 --> 48:11.931
I'm not fit
to be a mom?

48:13.557 --> 48:15.476
No, Rachel, no.

48:15.476 --> 48:17.061
Don't you dare
question that.

48:18.521 --> 48:20.815
This, this is exactly
what she does.

48:20.815 --> 48:22.358
She gets
inside your head,

48:22.858 --> 48:25.736
makes you ask if you deserve
to be Eli's mother,

48:25.736 --> 48:27.321
makes you
lose faith.

48:27.905 --> 48:30.157
You can't let her
take that bond away.

48:31.367 --> 48:34.161
You are his mother
and you always will be.

48:47.842 --> 48:49.426
I always
loved this lamp.

48:50.261 --> 48:51.846
I'm glad
you kept it.

48:55.349 --> 48:57.852
- Hey, where did the
lullaby book come from?

48:58.978 --> 49:00.563
- Nowhere exciting.

49:01.397 --> 49:04.441
Little antique shop
in West Nowheresville, Maine.

49:05.234 --> 49:07.194
- Why didn't you
throw it away?

49:08.112 --> 49:09.697
- Because it's real.

49:10.948 --> 49:13.617
Because it proves
what happened.

49:16.579 --> 49:18.122
(deep somber music)

49:32.761 --> 49:34.305
(horn honks)

49:35.055 --> 49:36.640
(deep somber music)

49:58.913 --> 50:00.497
- It's Shabbes.

50:01.957 --> 50:03.918
- Oh, right,
yeah.

50:03.918 --> 50:05.628
I'm sorry.

50:05.920 --> 50:07.963
Uh, I'm looking--

50:08.422 --> 50:10.007
looking
for this address.

50:11.175 --> 50:12.801
- The Dybbuk Man.

50:12.801 --> 50:14.345
(other man spits
three times)

50:15.012 --> 50:16.597

50:29.777 --> 50:31.320

50:48.754 --> 50:50.464

51:02.268 --> 51:03.894

51:04.895 --> 51:06.480
- Unbelievable.

51:07.398 --> 51:08.941
(sighs)

51:09.942 --> 51:11.527
(door clangs)

51:14.905 --> 51:16.490
- Rabbi Cohen's

didn't speak to her for months

53:18.987 --> 53:20.656
when she got
her tattoo.

53:22.241 --> 53:25.369
- This is not classical Hebrew,
but neither is it modern,

53:25.369 --> 53:27.287
probably from
a middle period.

53:27.996 --> 53:29.540
- Oh.

53:29.540 --> 53:31.083
Well, see,
it's-it's pressed.

53:31.500 --> 53:34.044
Can't be older than
late 15th century, I'd say.

53:34.545 --> 53:36.046
- Mm-hm.

53:36.296 --> 53:37.881
Good.

53:39.133 --> 53:41.051
These tattoos are
not the only reason

53:41.051 --> 53:43.595
I'm going to be unwelcome
in a Jewish cemetery.

53:44.596 --> 53:46.265
And as for
the phone call,

53:46.723 --> 53:48.434
with what
you're facing,

53:48.434 --> 53:50.060

54:05.367 --> 54:07.953
You sang this song
to make your child sleep?

54:07.953 --> 54:09.413
- My wife did,
yeah.

54:09.413 --> 54:10.789
- It's a clever trap,

54:10.789 --> 54:12.875
tricking you into
taking that first step,

54:12.875 --> 54:15.085
giving the key
that first twist.

54:16.170 --> 54:17.754
- First step?

54:17.754 --> 54:19.798
- The first of three...
rituals.

54:20.883 --> 54:24.011
Lilith is close,
she's watching you,

54:24.678 --> 54:26.972
but the door's not
open for her yet.

54:26.972 --> 54:29.016
The song
is the first ritual,

54:29.016 --> 54:31.435
which calls her handmaid,
the Crone,

54:31.435 --> 54:33.854
and her servants,
the Lilim.

54:35.898 --> 54:37.441
- Lilim?

54:37.441 --> 54:39.318
- Fucked up,
mutant babies.

54:39.318 --> 54:40.903
- Mutant?

54:41.320 --> 54:43.155
(scoffs)
Okay.

54:43.155 --> 54:44.781
(eerie music)

54:44.781 --> 54:46.325

54:50.954 --> 54:52.623
(Quad Lilim hissing)

54:54.541 --> 54:56.335
(guttural sounds)

55:04.134 --> 55:06.887
- The second ritual
is a blood sacrifice

55:06.887 --> 55:09.306
of an unclean beast
to profane your home.

55:09.306 --> 55:10.724
- Wait, right, uh,

55:10.724 --> 55:12.768
what-what kind of rabbi
did you say you were?

55:12.768 --> 55:14.436
- The kind that
saves your son.

55:14.436 --> 55:16.688
Have you had any animals
that have died lately?

55:16.688 --> 55:18.690
Pets,
that sort of thing?

55:19.650 --> 55:21.193
- Yeah, I had a...

55:21.693 --> 55:23.237
a cockatoo
that died.

55:23.612 --> 55:25.155
It was
an accident.

55:25.155 --> 55:26.698
- A parrot.

55:27.491 --> 55:29.159
That's unclean.

55:29.159 --> 55:30.786
- What's the
third step?

55:30.786 --> 55:33.163
- The third step is you have
to spill the baby's blood.

55:33.163 --> 55:34.665
- Well, that's
not gonna happen.

55:34.665 --> 55:36.333
- Neither would
sacrificing your pet.

55:36.333 --> 55:38.001
Don't you see?

55:38.001 --> 55:39.753
The harbingers
are subtle.

55:39.753 --> 55:41.213
They manipulate.

55:41.213 --> 55:44.258
They live to open the door
for Lilith.

55:44.258 --> 55:46.677
If Eli spills
one drop of blood,

55:47.052 --> 55:49.263
Lilith will come
and she will take him,

55:49.846 --> 55:51.807
and she will leave
an imposter,

55:51.807 --> 55:54.309
a golem,

57:25.442 --> 57:26.568
I'll be right back.

57:26.568 --> 57:28.153
- Take your time.

57:28.862 --> 57:30.947
Oh.
Bye, Mama.

57:32.032 --> 57:34.326
- You need to
recite these words.

57:34.326 --> 57:35.911
Stevie,
please.

57:38.872 --> 57:41.124
Those candles must burn
until dawn.

57:41.500 --> 57:43.418

57:44.211 --> 57:45.754
You must
do these things

57:45.754 --> 57:47.464
until the first light
on Shabbes.

57:48.548 --> 57:50.175
Then,
and only then,

57:50.175 --> 57:52.344
will Lilith be driven
from your home.

57:54.388 --> 57:56.723
- So, it's like
splashing some holy water

57:56.723 --> 57:58.141
and saying
the Our Father?

57:58.141 --> 57:59.851
- Wake up, man.

57:59.851 --> 58:02.521
This is about
saving your son.

58:03.021 --> 58:05.691
Tell me, John,
why did you convert?

58:06.692 --> 58:08.235
- Love.

58:09.736 --> 58:11.780
And my mother-in-law.
(scoffs)

58:11.780 --> 58:14.950
- Unfortunately,
Lilith isn't that easily fooled.

58:15.826 --> 58:18.078
She can tell the difference
between apathy

58:19.371 --> 58:20.956
and a true believer.

58:25.794 --> 58:27.337
Take this.

58:32.342 --> 58:34.052
It professes
your faith, John.

58:34.052 --> 58:35.554
Lilith is strong,

58:35.887 --> 58:38.098
but she's not
as strong as faith.

58:38.807 --> 58:41.518
And that's something

the only way.

1:02:23.573 --> 1:02:25.116
- I don't understand.

1:02:25.617 --> 1:02:27.577
- When Lilith
comes for your son,

1:02:29.704 --> 1:02:31.539
I'll get
my Zachary back.

1:02:31.915 --> 1:02:33.625
- You wanted
this to happen?

1:02:33.625 --> 1:02:35.418
- Not want.

1:02:35.418 --> 1:02:36.920
I needed it to.

1:02:37.420 --> 1:02:41.007
- You, you told Mom
to send me the lullaby book.

1:02:41.007 --> 1:02:42.717
You wanted me
to sing it.

1:02:42.717 --> 1:02:44.302
- Yes.

1:02:45.679 --> 1:02:47.263
No.

1:02:48.306 --> 1:02:50.016
A bit of both,
Rach.

1:02:50.850 --> 1:02:52.602
Every night
since Eli was born,

1:02:52.602 --> 1:02:54.562
I sat there
praying that you'd sing

1:02:54.562 --> 1:02:56.314
and praying
that you wouldn't.

1:02:56.314 --> 1:02:57.774
- Give him
to me.

1:02:57.774 --> 1:02:59.359
- She'll come.

1:02:59.734 --> 1:03:01.444
We'll follow her
into the dark,

1:03:01.861 --> 1:03:03.822
and we'll bring them
both home,

1:03:04.990 --> 1:03:06.908
Eli and Zachary.

1:03:07.701 --> 1:03:09.411
- If you hurt him--

1:03:09.411 --> 1:03:11.371
- It's just
a little pin prick.

1:03:12.622 --> 1:03:14.207
(Eli coos)

1:03:15.917 --> 1:03:17.502

1:03:23.717 --> 1:03:25.301
(eerie music)

1:03:35.979 --> 1:03:37.564

(John panting)
(Crone hisses)

1:03:52.245 --> 1:03:53.830
- Sing with me,
Rachel.

1:03:55.165 --> 1:03:56.875
We have to
face this together,

1:03:57.792 --> 1:03:59.377
as sisters.

1:04:18.396 --> 1:04:20.023

1:04:22.442 --> 1:04:23.985
Get outta here!

1:04:27.864 --> 1:04:29.616
