WEBVTT

00:14.623 --> 00:15.972
So?

00:17.582 --> 00:19.541
I'm getting transferred
to the 2-9.

00:19.584 --> 00:24.807
Oh, uh, well, that house
is supposed to be a real zoo.

00:24.850 --> 00:26.461
Yeah, well, boss didn't
give me a choice.

00:26.504 --> 00:29.377
Think your dad had a hand in it?
Busting your chops a little?

00:29.420 --> 00:30.987
No, I think it was
just the luck of the draw.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.423
Some luck.

00:32.467 --> 00:34.034
Well, I like a challenge.

00:34.077 --> 00:36.471
Maybe I'll put in for
a transfer over there.

00:36.514 --> 00:38.560
Yeah, let me get
the lay of the land first.

00:38.603 --> 00:40.301
Of course. Uh,
do you think

00:40.344 --> 00:41.432
he'd put the kibosh
on that, too?

00:41.476 --> 00:43.086
Us in the same house?

00:43.130 --> 00:45.045
I think he'll say what he wants,
we'll say what we want,

00:45.088 --> 00:46.872
and at the end of the day,
it'll be our choice.

00:46.916 --> 00:48.483
That's how it works
in our family.

00:48.526 --> 00:50.398
If you say so.I know so.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.010
You look good in stripes.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.056
Thanks.

01:01.757 --> 01:05.543
I told the police I don't want
Billy to be prosecuted.

01:05.587 --> 01:07.893
In your initial statement,
you said Conroy

01:07.937 --> 01:11.201
struck you repeatedly
and threatened your life.

01:11.245 --> 01:13.943
He was a jerk, um,
but I overreacted.

01:13.986 --> 01:15.814
Did you overreact
seven months ago,

01:15.858 --> 01:18.121
the last time you called 911
on this guy?

01:18.165 --> 01:20.123
No.

01:20.167 --> 01:21.603
I wanted to testify,

01:21.646 --> 01:23.605
but I never got the chance.

01:23.648 --> 01:24.519
Why not?Because you guys

01:24.562 --> 01:26.390
decided not to prosecute him.

01:27.522 --> 01:30.133
Did the assigned A.D.A.
give you a reason?

01:30.177 --> 01:33.528
Billy's one of the top
sports agents in the country.

01:33.571 --> 01:35.834
He's rich,
knows everyone.

01:35.878 --> 01:40.230
I wasn't exactly shocked
that he got away with it.

01:53.678 --> 01:55.245
GORMLEY:
Come in.

01:55.289 --> 01:57.073
You wanted to see us, boss?

01:57.117 --> 01:58.988
Yeah. Come in. Close the door.

01:59.031 --> 02:00.424
Sarge.

02:00.468 --> 02:02.818
What brings you back
to the squad?

02:02.861 --> 02:04.036
The old man get
sick of you?

02:04.080 --> 02:05.516
I missed you guys.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.431
We miss you, too, Sarge.What's up?

02:07.475 --> 02:09.216
Sit down.

02:12.175 --> 02:14.656
You know Detective Ray Cross?

02:14.699 --> 02:17.789
Yeah. We-we worked a case with
him a while back with the DEA.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.182
Solid cop.

02:19.226 --> 02:20.836
Until he got jammed up
last year.

02:20.879 --> 02:22.490
Something about
money going missing

02:22.533 --> 02:23.882
from an ongoing
narcotics operation?

02:23.926 --> 02:25.319
Right.

02:25.362 --> 02:27.495
PC let him retire,
which he didn't have to do.

02:27.538 --> 02:30.628
A few months ago, we started
getting electronic threats

02:30.672 --> 02:32.064
against the commissioner.

02:32.108 --> 02:33.631
The content

02:33.675 --> 02:35.459
points to Cross.

02:35.503 --> 02:37.200
Threat Assessment
usually handles this.

02:37.244 --> 02:38.767
Why you coming to us?

02:38.810 --> 02:41.248
This morning, Cross was spotted
outside a Manhattan hotel

02:41.291 --> 02:43.511
where your old man
was having breakfast.

02:46.383 --> 02:49.299
So you think
this Cross is serious?

02:49.343 --> 02:50.866
I'm not taking any chances,
all right?

02:50.909 --> 02:52.694
You guys worked with him.
Use that.

02:52.737 --> 02:54.217
I want you
to track down Cross,

02:54.261 --> 02:56.393
let him know we got eyes on him.

02:56.437 --> 02:57.829
All right?
Hopefully then,

02:57.873 --> 02:59.266
he'll back the hell off.

02:59.309 --> 03:01.181
It'll probably help
if we talk to the commissioner.

03:01.224 --> 03:02.573
No, that's not gonna happen.

03:02.617 --> 03:04.227
Why not?DANNY: Because,
knowing my old man,

03:04.271 --> 03:06.360
he doesn't want to waste
the additional manpower

03:06.403 --> 03:08.188
on his own safety, right?

03:08.231 --> 03:10.842
Right, so don't go blabbing
about this over Sunday dinner.

03:10.886 --> 03:12.235
Yes.

03:12.279 --> 03:14.629
Rattle Cross's cage, quietly.

03:18.676 --> 03:21.113
Would you like
some coffee, Ms. Peterson?

03:21.157 --> 03:23.159
Uh, no, thank you.

03:28.556 --> 03:29.731
What's up?

03:29.774 --> 03:31.733
A young attorney in my office

03:31.776 --> 03:34.736
was sexually assaulted
on a blind date.

03:34.779 --> 03:37.652
I'm sorry to hear that.

03:37.695 --> 03:39.262
Her name is Paula Thompson.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.656
She's a lovely person
and a sharp lawyer.

03:41.699 --> 03:43.614
A rare combination.

03:43.658 --> 03:45.573
Has there been an arrest?Not yet.

03:45.616 --> 03:48.576
I would like you
to review the case.

03:48.619 --> 03:53.450
Specifically,
this investigating detective.

03:55.887 --> 03:57.454
For?

03:57.498 --> 03:59.761
When Paula reported
the assault,

03:59.804 --> 04:03.068
she met with Special Victims
Detective Anthony Palmer,

04:03.112 --> 04:06.550
who made her feel
like she was the suspect.

04:06.594 --> 04:12.252
Well, not to take sides,
but victims of such crimes

04:12.295 --> 04:16.560
are often, understandably,
emotional and defensive.

04:16.604 --> 04:19.389
Palmer asked her why she went
back to this guy's apartment,

04:19.433 --> 04:21.826
and whether she'd
acted provocatively.

04:21.870 --> 04:24.133
Well, that would
be standard, Kelly.

04:24.176 --> 04:25.700
There is a very refined protocol

04:25.743 --> 04:29.965
for Special Victims detectives
to follow, and it works.

04:30.008 --> 04:33.142
But when any victim
of sexual assault is treated

04:33.185 --> 04:36.754
as though they were
somehow asking for it...

04:36.798 --> 04:40.541
It would be adding insult
to injury.

04:40.584 --> 04:42.151
I completely agree.

04:42.194 --> 04:46.460
As I assume you knew I would.

04:46.503 --> 04:48.549
I don't assume anything.

04:48.592 --> 04:51.552
Okay. I will drill down on it.

04:51.595 --> 04:55.817
And please send my sympathies
and regards to Ms. Thompson.

04:58.080 --> 05:01.475
She's preparing
to file suit against the NYPD.

05:06.175 --> 05:09.918
Look at you, burying the lede.

05:09.961 --> 05:11.441
I convinced her to hold off

05:11.485 --> 05:13.356
until I had a chance
to speak with you.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.792
Gee, thanks.

05:14.836 --> 05:16.141
Frank.

05:16.185 --> 05:19.754
An assistant corporation counsel
suing the NYPD?

05:19.797 --> 05:21.538
Nobody wants that.

05:21.582 --> 05:23.932
Not nobody, apparently.

05:23.975 --> 05:25.934
If it can be prevented.

05:25.977 --> 05:30.373
I was happily going
to look into this for you.

05:30.417 --> 05:33.724
Now I will just plain
look into it.

05:33.768 --> 05:35.770
Thank you.

05:47.695 --> 05:50.785
â™ª

06:13.460 --> 06:16.419
Ray Cross.

06:16.463 --> 06:17.986
Got a second?

06:18.029 --> 06:19.466
Well, I'm a little swamped,

06:19.509 --> 06:20.989
but I'll see if I can
squeeze you guys in.

06:21.032 --> 06:22.207
It's been a few years.

06:22.251 --> 06:24.166
Reagan, Baez.

06:24.209 --> 06:25.907
Dominguez cartel case, 2015.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.604
That's right.

06:27.648 --> 06:29.606
You did good work.You, too.

06:29.650 --> 06:33.654
Ah. This, uh, threat level's
a little lower on this job.

06:33.697 --> 06:35.264
Never saw anybody
run a drug case better.

06:35.307 --> 06:37.658
Well, apparently,
your old man disagreed.

06:37.701 --> 06:41.270
Yeah. Must've pissed you off,
getting forced out.

06:43.403 --> 06:47.015
I told One PP I had nothing
to do with those e-mails.

06:47.058 --> 06:48.103
Right.They made reference

06:48.146 --> 06:49.800
to the case
you got jammed up on.

06:49.844 --> 06:51.976
A lot of guys got pissed off
the way that went down.

06:52.020 --> 06:53.587
But only one guy took the fall.

06:53.630 --> 06:55.632
I got no grudge against the PC.

06:55.676 --> 06:56.851
So what were you doing
camped outside

06:56.894 --> 06:58.243
the PC's breakfast meeting?

06:59.506 --> 07:00.985
Loafer City.

07:01.029 --> 07:01.943
Come again?

07:01.986 --> 07:03.553
It's my favorite shoe store.

07:04.815 --> 07:06.730
I got problem arches.

07:09.341 --> 07:10.908
10:07 a.m.

07:10.952 --> 07:13.476
Well, it's a hell of an alibi.

07:13.520 --> 07:16.000
Sometimes a loafer
is just a loafer.

07:17.132 --> 07:18.394
I had no clue
the PC was

07:18.438 --> 07:20.657
even in the area
until I spotted his vehicle.

07:20.701 --> 07:22.224
So we don't have
a problem then, right?

07:22.267 --> 07:23.965
No problem.

07:25.488 --> 07:27.795
Give my best to your old man.

07:38.545 --> 07:40.329
Martin, you got a second?

07:40.372 --> 07:42.897
Sure. Everything okay?

07:42.940 --> 07:44.289
Yeah. Seven months ago,

07:44.333 --> 07:47.510
you handled an assault case
against Billy Conroy.

07:47.554 --> 07:49.904
Beat up his girlfriend
but walked. Felt bad for her.

07:49.947 --> 07:51.688
I reviewed the file.

07:51.732 --> 07:54.125
You had plenty of evidence
to indict, but you didn't.

07:54.169 --> 07:56.171
It's complicated.

07:57.346 --> 07:59.914
Walk me through it.

08:04.658 --> 08:07.312
The case against Conroy
was strong.

08:07.356 --> 08:08.836
In my opinion,
he should've been indicted.

08:08.879 --> 08:09.837
So what happened?

08:09.880 --> 08:12.492
I was told to back off.By whom?

08:12.535 --> 08:14.276
I'd rather not say.

08:14.319 --> 08:16.060
I'd rather be Brad Pitt.

08:16.104 --> 08:17.714
It-It's just,
the person involved

08:17.758 --> 08:20.630
was... they're
no longer with us.

08:20.674 --> 08:23.546
Well, if he or she left
the office, it should be easier.

08:23.590 --> 08:26.723
She didn't just
leave the office.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.159
She left the planet.

08:30.727 --> 08:32.990
Are we talking
about Monica Graham?

08:33.034 --> 08:34.818
I did what I was told.

08:34.862 --> 08:36.472
And I'm not looking
to disrespect her memory,

08:36.516 --> 08:41.129
but what happened
wasn't justice.

08:47.178 --> 08:49.050
You know why you're here,
Detective?

08:49.093 --> 08:52.053
C.O. said it's about
the Thompson case.

08:52.096 --> 08:54.055
I can't say I'm surprised.

08:54.098 --> 08:55.926
Why's that?

08:55.970 --> 08:57.928
She's an assistant
corporation counsel.

08:57.972 --> 08:59.800
Told me that
right up front.

08:59.843 --> 09:03.151
Hmm.She says you were
unprofessional and accusatory,

09:03.194 --> 09:04.979
and treated her
like the perp.

09:05.022 --> 09:07.851
I can see
why it felt that way to her.

09:07.895 --> 09:09.113
So you admit it?

09:09.157 --> 09:11.202
No, sir. But the protocols

09:11.246 --> 09:13.248
for questioning
a sexual assault victim mean

09:13.291 --> 09:15.206
asking questions about
the nature of the relationship

09:15.250 --> 09:16.817
with the alleged perp.

09:16.860 --> 09:18.601
Which can make
a victim defensive.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.821
That's putting it mildly.

09:20.864 --> 09:22.257
Some have come
across the table at me.

09:22.300 --> 09:26.566
So is it you or the protocol?

09:26.609 --> 09:28.785
The protocol's
solid, sir.

09:28.829 --> 09:30.178
And I know you had
a hand it writing them.

09:30.221 --> 09:31.832
I'm not blowing smoke.

09:31.875 --> 09:35.400
But the very nature of asking
them about their own behavior,

09:35.444 --> 09:38.360
I guess it can't help but sting.

09:40.014 --> 09:44.801
Is there a reason why you
interviewed her three times

09:44.845 --> 09:47.151
and the accused only once?

09:47.195 --> 09:49.153
Well, with an emotionally
distressed victim,

09:49.197 --> 09:52.200
and obviously, most of them are,
sometimes multiple interviews

09:52.243 --> 09:53.680
are required to get
all of the facts

09:53.723 --> 09:56.073
in an ongoing
investigation.

09:56.117 --> 09:58.162
So, uh, you're saying
it was by the book?

09:58.206 --> 10:00.556
Yes, sir.Let me ask you,

10:00.600 --> 10:04.560
when she told you she was an
assistant corporation counsel,

10:04.604 --> 10:07.258
you think she was
looking for special treatment?

10:07.302 --> 10:08.782
No more than anybody.

10:08.825 --> 10:11.175
She expected me to go out
and arrest this guy,

10:11.219 --> 10:12.786
no questions asked.

10:12.829 --> 10:14.483
And I get it.

10:14.526 --> 10:17.051
In her shoes,
I'd want the same thing.

10:17.094 --> 10:18.879
But if you don't do your job,

10:18.922 --> 10:21.272
then the D.A.'s office
can't do theirs.

10:21.316 --> 10:25.320
And that's when rapists walk
right back out the door.

10:28.105 --> 10:32.153
Thank you very much,
Detective Palmer.

10:40.248 --> 10:42.598
The man you're replacing is
the final holdover

10:42.642 --> 10:43.860
from the last captain.

10:43.904 --> 10:45.557
Heard there were some
problems on his watch.

10:45.601 --> 10:47.298
Between you and me,
the biggest problem was him.

10:47.342 --> 10:49.170
More concerned with his
golf game than this command.

10:49.213 --> 10:53.653
If I may, boss, uh, why me,
though, a rookie sergeant?

10:53.696 --> 10:54.784
Number one on
the Sergeant's Exam,

10:54.828 --> 10:57.178
Mayor's Award at the Academy,
why not?

10:57.221 --> 10:59.006
Especially with two PCs
in the family,

10:59.049 --> 11:00.181
one the current?

11:00.224 --> 11:03.314
Well, it doesn't hurt, no.

11:03.358 --> 11:07.231
But far down the list
as to why you. Okay?

11:07.275 --> 11:08.711
Here to help any way I can.

11:08.755 --> 11:11.540
Then let's put the fear of God
into these guys.

11:14.151 --> 11:16.893
All due respect, boss,
that's, uh, not really my style.

11:16.937 --> 11:19.330
Uh-huh. It is now.

11:19.374 --> 11:22.377
I'd like to earn their trust,
maybe take it from there?

11:22.420 --> 11:25.119
Sergeant Reagan,
this house is on fire.

11:25.162 --> 11:26.729
Hose it down.

11:26.773 --> 11:29.123
Go from there. Understood?

11:29.166 --> 11:30.602
Yes, sir.

11:39.002 --> 11:40.569
DANNY:
What do we got, Detective?

11:40.612 --> 11:43.354
PC is due in 20 minutes.Uh-huh.

11:43.398 --> 11:45.966
And look what I found.

11:48.316 --> 11:49.839
Surprise, surprise.

11:49.883 --> 11:52.146
Found him in the park when we
were doing our security sweep.

11:52.189 --> 11:54.191
Public park, there's
no law against it.

11:55.410 --> 11:58.239
And I took this off him.

11:58.282 --> 12:00.067
Legally registered gun.

12:00.110 --> 12:01.329
Expecting trouble?

12:01.372 --> 12:02.722
Dangerous world.

12:02.765 --> 12:03.984
Thank you, Detective.

12:04.027 --> 12:05.202
You know, it's
the second time today

12:05.246 --> 12:07.378
you've been found
in the vicinity of the PC.

12:07.422 --> 12:09.250
We supposed to believe
that's a coincidence?

12:09.293 --> 12:11.818
Believe whatever you want.
It's a free country.

12:11.861 --> 12:14.255
You willing to come down to
squad, answer some questions?

12:14.298 --> 12:16.387
Yeah, it'll be
like old times.
Great.

12:16.431 --> 12:17.737
Let's go.

12:22.306 --> 12:23.264
Thank you.

12:23.307 --> 12:27.007
Sorry to drag you
down here.

12:27.050 --> 12:28.225
Done hundreds of these.

12:28.269 --> 12:30.271
First time on
the other side.

12:30.314 --> 12:32.403
It doesn't have to
be this way, Detective.

12:32.447 --> 12:35.493
I'm not a detective anymore.

12:35.537 --> 12:38.061
PC saw to that.

12:38.105 --> 12:41.238
: You ran an operation
where drug money went missing.

12:41.282 --> 12:42.805
You don't have evidence
I took a single dime.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.241
BAEZ:
It was your show,

12:44.285 --> 12:45.416
your responsibility.

12:45.460 --> 12:46.591
DANNY: That's right,
and the PC could have

12:46.635 --> 12:48.724
fired you over it,
but he didn't.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.813
He let you retire
and keep your pension.

12:50.857 --> 12:52.249
Imagine my gratitude.

12:52.293 --> 12:54.991
Look, Ray,
whatever your beef is,

12:55.035 --> 12:56.340
it's in the past.

12:56.384 --> 13:00.040
Why don't you be smart
and leave it there.

13:03.391 --> 13:05.393
You believe in loyalty, Danny?

13:05.436 --> 13:08.831
Yeah, I believe in loyalty.

13:08.875 --> 13:13.183
My task force
made the big cases.

13:13.227 --> 13:15.011
We also took the most
casualties.

13:15.055 --> 13:16.796
What are you
getting at here, Ray?

13:16.839 --> 13:19.276
What I'm getting at, Danny,
is if some of the cash

13:19.320 --> 13:21.409
belonging to some
of the scumbags

13:21.452 --> 13:23.846
that killed my people
finds its way

13:23.890 --> 13:25.935
into the pockets
of their loved ones,

13:25.979 --> 13:27.328
I can live with that.

13:27.371 --> 13:28.808
Is that what happened?

13:30.461 --> 13:32.289
I don't know what
you're talking about.

13:32.333 --> 13:35.162
Everyone respects
the losses you took.

13:35.205 --> 13:37.512
I'm not so sure everybody
appreciates those losses.

13:37.555 --> 13:39.470
Whether you want
to believe it or not,

13:39.514 --> 13:41.603
my old man mourns the death
of every fallen officer

13:41.646 --> 13:42.691
in his command.

13:42.734 --> 13:44.998
Eulogies are easy.

13:45.041 --> 13:46.651
Being there

13:46.695 --> 13:49.437
after the cameras leave,

13:49.480 --> 13:51.091
that's what really counts.

13:51.134 --> 13:53.267
Here's the bottom line.

13:53.310 --> 13:55.356
I don't give a damn
what your beef is,

13:55.399 --> 13:56.879
just know this.

13:56.923 --> 13:58.663
You want to get to him,

13:58.707 --> 14:02.319
you're gonna have to go
through me first.

14:04.539 --> 14:07.890
Guess I'll be on my way.

14:07.934 --> 14:09.326
Do yourself a favor.

14:09.370 --> 14:11.851
Stay away from Frank Reagan.

14:36.049 --> 14:37.833
Officers, muster up.

14:39.617 --> 14:41.532
I said fall in, move!

14:42.969 --> 14:45.101
On my command,
open ranks for inspection.

14:46.624 --> 14:47.887
Open ranks. Move.

14:54.241 --> 14:56.243
You lose your hat, Officer?No, Sergeant.

14:56.286 --> 14:58.245
Then cover it now.

15:03.119 --> 15:04.860
Get that hair
off your collar.

15:04.904 --> 15:08.385
And lose the red nail polish.
This isn't the junior prom.

15:12.694 --> 15:13.913
What's your hire date?

15:13.956 --> 15:15.610
May 2008, sir.

15:15.653 --> 15:19.179
That means no visible tattoos.
I don't want to see it again.

15:22.312 --> 15:23.487
Now, this is what

15:23.531 --> 15:25.272
an NYPD officer is
supposed to look like.

15:25.315 --> 15:27.491
All squared away.
Well done, Officer Jordan.Thank you, sir.

15:28.797 --> 15:32.366
My name is Sergeant Reagan.
I'm the new boss.

15:32.409 --> 15:35.586
If you pay me respect, you'll
get it back with interest.

15:35.630 --> 15:37.937
If you give me grief,
you won't know what hit you.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.286
Any questions?

15:41.636 --> 15:44.378
Let's get down to business.

15:47.424 --> 15:51.080
Why would Monica let
a serial abuser off scot

15:51.124 --> 15:53.126
She was a good prosecutor.

15:53.169 --> 15:55.693
She must have had her reasons
for letting Conroy skate.

15:55.737 --> 15:57.565
I would have charged him
with assault two,

15:57.608 --> 15:58.958
possibly even attempted murder.

15:59.001 --> 16:01.134
You disagree?
No.

16:01.177 --> 16:03.179
Now, Monica and I have had
our share of run-ins,

16:03.223 --> 16:06.008
but when it came to prosecuting
crimes against women,

16:06.052 --> 16:07.270
she was a bulldog.

16:07.314 --> 16:09.316
So why did she let Conroy walk?

16:09.359 --> 16:10.186
Guess we'll never know.

16:10.230 --> 16:12.058
No, that's not good enough.

16:12.101 --> 16:16.062
I know what you're thinking,
and it's a bad idea.

16:16.105 --> 16:19.717
You heard A.D.A. Richardson.
He said this wasn't justice.

16:19.761 --> 16:21.284
You really want to
start staining her reputation?

16:21.328 --> 16:25.071
Look, if Monica had
a legitimate reason

16:25.114 --> 16:27.812
why she chose not to prosecute,
then there's no problem.

16:27.856 --> 16:31.338
If there isn't,
then I need to know.

16:33.383 --> 16:34.819
Detective Palmer says

16:34.863 --> 16:37.344
he conducted his investigation
professionally.

16:37.387 --> 16:39.215
And Paula Thompson says
he didn't.

16:39.259 --> 16:41.043
I spoke to Ms. Thompson.Yeah, I heard.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.349
I have no reason to doubt

16:42.392 --> 16:45.265
her version of events.Neither do I.

16:45.308 --> 16:48.398
But I also have no reason
to doubt Detective Palmer.

16:48.442 --> 16:50.574
Did you speak with any
of the other victims
who dealt with this guy?

16:50.618 --> 16:53.099
The nature of these
crimes prevents me

16:53.142 --> 16:55.014
from going down that road.

16:55.057 --> 16:57.233
In other words, it's a case
of "he said, she said,"

16:57.277 --> 16:59.496
and, oh, what do you know,
hewins.

16:59.540 --> 17:01.890
If you're suggesting
that a male cannot work

17:01.933 --> 17:04.414
effectively
in Special Victims,

17:04.458 --> 17:08.114
I have thousands of made
cases that say otherwise.

17:08.157 --> 17:10.246
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but your detail's out front,

17:10.290 --> 17:13.336
and you're running
15 behind.

17:13.380 --> 17:14.555
Nobody is saying that a man

17:14.598 --> 17:16.861
can't be a good
SVU investigator,

17:16.905 --> 17:19.951
but he sure as hell starts
with a disadvantage.

17:19.995 --> 17:21.127
Namely?

17:21.170 --> 17:24.304
He's not a woman.

17:26.697 --> 17:28.482
Few men are.

17:29.744 --> 17:33.226
Baker, please wait.

17:33.269 --> 17:34.879
Come in for a second.

17:38.448 --> 17:39.580
I think I got the gist.

17:39.623 --> 17:43.410
You take this to
its logical extreme,

17:43.453 --> 17:46.108
it means that every
victim is entitled

17:46.152 --> 17:49.546
to an investigating detective
who is a gender, racial,

17:49.590 --> 17:53.115
ethnic, whatever else
you have match.

17:53.159 --> 17:54.551
Which is impossible.

17:54.595 --> 17:57.380
It's the police department,
not a college faculty.

17:57.424 --> 18:01.863
But. Except.

18:04.866 --> 18:06.433
Really?

18:06.476 --> 18:09.740
Yes. There is plenty
of good research,

18:09.784 --> 18:11.438
not to mention common sense,

18:11.481 --> 18:13.962
that says that the female victim
in these cases

18:14.005 --> 18:17.444
may not be as candid in
opening up to a male detective.

18:17.487 --> 18:19.924
And that the male detective
may be hardwired

18:19.968 --> 18:21.143
with an empathy gap.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.841
Hey, we got a whole lot
of made cases

18:23.885 --> 18:25.365
from male detectives.

18:25.408 --> 18:28.803
Because you have great cops
who work hard

18:28.846 --> 18:30.370
to overcome
those obstacles.

18:30.413 --> 18:32.241
But there are always exceptions.

18:32.285 --> 18:36.376
The detective in question
seemed absolutely transparent

18:36.419 --> 18:38.160
when I talked to him, Baker.

18:38.204 --> 18:39.379
The detective was being
interviewed

18:39.422 --> 18:40.815
by the police commissioner.

18:40.858 --> 18:44.732
Pretty must defines the term
"on his best behavior."

18:47.648 --> 18:49.693
Good point.

18:49.737 --> 18:52.783
Thank you for reminding me.

18:54.829 --> 18:57.397
The real test is
that detective's behavior

18:57.440 --> 19:00.704
in interviewing a victim
of sexual assault.

19:04.404 --> 19:09.191
And your sense... is what?

19:09.235 --> 19:13.326
Well, I'm not sure.
I wasn't in the room.

19:13.369 --> 19:16.459
But I do think that
you need to follow up.

19:21.508 --> 19:23.423
You know, it's just
a matter of time

19:23.466 --> 19:25.381
before Cross tries again, right?

19:25.425 --> 19:26.948
We could put a tail on him.

19:26.991 --> 19:28.341
Come on, the guy's
an ex-detective.

19:28.384 --> 19:29.690
He'd make us in a second.

19:31.344 --> 19:33.041
You know, in the old days,
someone threatened the PC,

19:33.084 --> 19:38.351
my grandfather said they'd
handle things "in-house."

19:38.394 --> 19:40.048
You mean give him a beating?

19:40.091 --> 19:41.441
Got the job done.Danny,

19:41.484 --> 19:42.529
I know this is personal for you,

19:42.572 --> 19:45.271
but going after Cross
off the books

19:45.314 --> 19:46.402
is not the answer.

19:46.446 --> 19:48.317
It's not that personal, okay?

19:48.361 --> 19:49.884
My old man can
take care of himself,

19:49.927 --> 19:53.801
but I didn't say
we should do that.

19:53.844 --> 19:55.368
I'm just saying...

19:55.411 --> 19:56.978
Okay, we should do it.

19:57.021 --> 19:58.458
Look, the guy's not
a typical perp.

19:58.501 --> 19:59.589
He knows everything we know,

19:59.633 --> 20:01.330
he's trained
the way we're trained.

20:01.374 --> 20:03.854
Not to mention knowing
the PC's every move.Exactly.

20:03.898 --> 20:05.552
He knows the PC's every move.

20:05.595 --> 20:07.336
The public ones,
that's easy to find out.

20:07.380 --> 20:10.252
But what about breakfast
at a hotel in Midtown?

20:10.296 --> 20:12.472
That's confidential.

20:12.515 --> 20:15.344
Only his detail and One PP brass
get that schedule.

20:15.388 --> 20:16.693
Exactly.

20:18.521 --> 20:21.350
Well, if an ex-cop knew his way
around computers,

20:21.394 --> 20:25.572
or knew someone who knew
their way around computers,

20:25.615 --> 20:27.226
they might be able to figure out

20:27.269 --> 20:29.140
how to get access
to that information.

20:37.714 --> 20:38.889
Hey, what do you got?

20:38.933 --> 20:41.240
I checked for a connection
between Monica

20:41.283 --> 20:43.590
and this prick Conroy;
there isn't one.

20:43.633 --> 20:46.767
So, why would Monica
let Conroy walk?

20:46.810 --> 20:48.595
Because Monica had no connection

20:48.638 --> 20:51.119
to Conroy, but her boss did.

20:51.162 --> 20:54.122
You mean
Chief Assistant Whitney?

20:54.165 --> 20:56.951
How's a guy on that salary
sit courtside,

20:56.994 --> 20:58.996
behind the dugout
and on the glass?

20:59.040 --> 21:01.564
Tickets from Conroy.

21:01.608 --> 21:03.436
Not just tickets, boxes.

21:03.479 --> 21:05.307
He was paving his way up.

21:05.351 --> 21:08.484
I'm guessing Monica gave Conroy
a pass on Whitney's orders.

21:08.528 --> 21:09.833
Why would she do that?

21:09.877 --> 21:11.487
Whitney's a backstabbing weasel

21:11.531 --> 21:13.446
who likes to get people fired.

21:13.489 --> 21:16.275
Monica knew better
than to cross him.

21:16.318 --> 21:18.146
I hope you do, too.

21:29.418 --> 21:32.421
Conroy knows Cara Simpson
changed her story.

21:32.465 --> 21:34.728
Why would he confess when
he holds all the cards?

21:34.771 --> 21:35.946
Because we can bluff.

21:35.990 --> 21:37.470
We can also fold.

21:37.513 --> 21:38.949
I don't fold.

21:38.993 --> 21:42.039
Mr. Conroy, thank you
so much for coming in.

21:42.083 --> 21:43.737
No problem. I'm
not really sure

21:43.780 --> 21:44.999
why I'm here.

21:45.042 --> 21:46.435
You're here because

21:46.479 --> 21:47.915
beating up women
is against the law.

21:47.958 --> 21:52.180
Mr. Conroy has been charged
with no such crime.

21:52.223 --> 21:54.965
Not yet, but after
reviewing the facts,

21:55.009 --> 21:56.837
I've decided to take
this case on personally.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.839
That's your prerogative.

21:58.882 --> 22:02.408
And as bureau chief, I have
vast investigative resources.

22:02.451 --> 22:05.019
Look, I-I feel terrible
that I frightened Cara.

22:05.062 --> 22:05.933
That wasn't my intention.

22:05.976 --> 22:07.195
What was your intention?

22:07.238 --> 22:09.066
Don't answer that.It's okay.

22:09.110 --> 22:11.286
We had an argument.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.984
I lost my temper,
but I did not hit her.

22:14.028 --> 22:16.813
So, she gave herself
that black eye?

22:16.857 --> 22:18.337
BELL:
We're here as a courtesy.

22:18.380 --> 22:19.816
If you have something to say...

22:19.860 --> 22:22.297
I do. Your client
is a serial abuser.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.603
He got away with it once.

22:23.646 --> 22:25.039
It's not gonna happen again.

22:25.082 --> 22:26.083
Okay, let's slow down.

22:26.127 --> 22:27.258
I'm not finished.

22:27.302 --> 22:28.434
Ms. Simpson

22:28.477 --> 22:31.001
has been reluctant to testify.

22:31.045 --> 22:33.308
I intend to change her mind
and I can be very persuasive.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.397
So, here's the deal
which does expire

22:35.441 --> 22:36.833
the moment you
leave this room.

22:36.877 --> 22:41.664
Mr. Conroy will plead
to assault in the third degree,

22:41.708 --> 22:45.146
agrees to enter counseling and
completes a batterer's program.

22:45.189 --> 22:48.236
And if we refuse?

22:48.279 --> 22:50.847
Then I charge your client
with assault two,

22:50.891 --> 22:52.980
indict him
and take this case to trial,

22:53.023 --> 22:55.722
which I'm sure will be
very well-publicized.

23:05.514 --> 23:07.386
Your offer is declined.

23:09.213 --> 23:10.954
Send my best to Cara.

23:16.264 --> 23:18.440
Well, so much for bluffing.

23:18.484 --> 23:19.876
This game's not over.

23:19.920 --> 23:22.183
How'd it go
with Billy Conroy?

23:22.226 --> 23:23.619
ERIN:
Chief Whitney.

23:23.663 --> 23:27.014
Uh, not well. How-how did
you know we were meeting?

23:27.057 --> 23:29.233
Oh, when you're
chief assistant D.A.,

23:29.277 --> 23:30.844
little birds always
seem to find you.

23:30.887 --> 23:33.107
Billy's a good man.

23:33.150 --> 23:34.848
We summer together
in Amagansett.

23:34.891 --> 23:36.806
Oh, so you must talk
to him all the time.

23:36.850 --> 23:38.286
Yeah, thing is,

23:38.329 --> 23:40.984
I like to know when my
bureau chiefs dig up old cases.

23:41.028 --> 23:44.031
I wasn't aware
of that policy.

23:44.074 --> 23:45.032
I'll have my office
set up a lunch.

23:45.075 --> 23:46.294
We can go over the ground rules.

23:46.337 --> 23:47.904
This is new territory, Erin.

23:47.948 --> 23:49.819
Don't want to get off
on the wrong foot.

23:57.044 --> 24:01.701
You told the officers that
your boyfriend raped you.

24:01.744 --> 24:04.138
Yes.

24:04.181 --> 24:05.879
We were supposed
to go to the movies.

24:05.922 --> 24:08.011
Tommy said that
he was too tired,

24:08.055 --> 24:10.884
so I said that I
would go by myself.

24:10.927 --> 24:12.059
He didn't like that.

24:12.102 --> 24:15.497
Hmm. What happened?

24:15.541 --> 24:18.848
He grabbed my arm,

24:18.892 --> 24:20.937
threw me on the couch

24:20.981 --> 24:23.026
and then he climbed
on top of me.

24:23.070 --> 24:25.159
And when I told him to get off,

24:25.202 --> 24:29.119
he hit me and then he raped me.

24:29.163 --> 24:31.774
He ever assault you before?

24:31.818 --> 24:34.560
He's hit me a few times,

24:34.603 --> 24:36.344
but he never
forced himself on me.

24:36.387 --> 24:38.172
You ever file a complaint?

24:38.215 --> 24:40.740
No.

24:40.783 --> 24:42.132
Does that matter?

24:42.176 --> 24:44.787
No. It's just...

24:44.831 --> 24:47.660
sexual assault cases involving
boyfriends and spouses

24:47.703 --> 24:49.009
can get kind of tricky.

24:49.052 --> 24:50.532
Tricky how?

24:50.576 --> 24:52.403
Juries rarely convict
when the victim has had

24:52.447 --> 24:55.537
consensual relations
with her assailant in the past.

24:55.581 --> 24:57.104
But I told him no.

24:57.147 --> 24:58.975
No means no, right?

24:59.019 --> 25:01.021
Of course.

25:01.064 --> 25:03.632
It's just that the fact is

25:03.676 --> 25:06.940
it's harder to convict
if it's been yes

25:06.983 --> 25:09.377
so many times in the past.

25:09.420 --> 25:11.248
So you're telling me

25:11.292 --> 25:13.033
I should just let him
get away with it?

25:13.076 --> 25:15.078
That's up to you.

25:15.122 --> 25:18.212
But the fact is,
unfortunately,

25:18.255 --> 25:20.214
he probably will.

25:23.739 --> 25:25.741
Are you sure I can't get you
something to drink?

25:25.785 --> 25:29.745
No. I've got everything I need.

25:44.194 --> 25:45.413
JAMIE:
Hey, hey!

25:45.456 --> 25:47.328
What the hell's
going on in here?

25:47.371 --> 25:48.851
Break it up. Break it up!
Let him go!

25:48.895 --> 25:49.939
Let him go.
That's enough!

25:49.983 --> 25:52.159
That's enough.

25:52.202 --> 25:53.334
What's this about?

25:53.377 --> 25:55.815
Nothing, Sarge.
Everything's fine.

25:55.858 --> 25:58.034
Well, somebody
better start talking

25:58.078 --> 26:00.602
or you're both
looking at suspension.

26:00.646 --> 26:02.735
Like he said,
there's no problem.

26:02.778 --> 26:04.563
How come none of you
were stepping in?

26:05.651 --> 26:07.348
All right, fine.

26:07.391 --> 26:09.219
Well, sitting on your hands
gets you written up, too.

26:09.263 --> 26:10.612
Let's go. Get out.

26:10.656 --> 26:12.614
Get out.

26:15.486 --> 26:16.662
Hey, Jordan.

26:16.705 --> 26:18.185
Not you. Come here.

26:21.188 --> 26:24.147
I reviewed the record of every
officer in this precinct.

26:24.191 --> 26:26.497
A lot of guys with black marks.
You're not one of them.

26:26.541 --> 26:27.498
Thank you, Sergeant.

26:27.542 --> 26:29.065
But that won't last

26:29.109 --> 26:31.198
if you start following these
guys down the wrong road.

26:31.241 --> 26:32.373
Now what happened here?

26:32.416 --> 26:35.637
I'd like
to tell you, really...
But?

26:35.681 --> 26:37.596
There's a code
in the 2-9.

26:37.639 --> 26:39.119
What happens
with the unis stays there.

26:39.162 --> 26:40.294
No ratting to the bosses.

26:40.337 --> 26:43.993
This is the NYPD,
not Rikers Island.

26:44.037 --> 26:46.474
Either you come clean
or you get dinged.

26:46.517 --> 26:49.085
Better that than getting
labeled a snitch.

27:01.010 --> 27:02.751
This lasagna
is incredible, Eddie.

27:02.795 --> 27:04.187
Oh, it's my mom's recipe.

27:04.231 --> 27:05.580
It's the only thing
I know how to make.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.190
Well, that and margaritas.

27:08.975 --> 27:10.803
Everything's great, Eddie,
but next time, you know,

27:10.846 --> 27:12.326
you can delegate.

27:12.369 --> 27:14.154
We do believe in division
of labor here.

27:14.197 --> 27:16.243
Yeah, and it's so good I almost
wouldn't mind dish duty.

27:16.286 --> 27:19.115
That's okay, Sean, it's okay.
I can clean up.

27:19.159 --> 27:20.203
No, you've done enough.

27:20.247 --> 27:22.249
Besides, Sean likes
to wear the apron.

27:22.292 --> 27:24.207
Well,
I want to do it.

27:24.251 --> 27:27.689
Y-You've all been
so welcoming to me

27:27.733 --> 27:31.301
and I just want you to know
I'm-I'm really grateful.

27:33.260 --> 27:35.697
Yeah. I think this would
be a perfect time

27:35.741 --> 27:37.133
to call a code blue.

27:39.179 --> 27:41.007
I don't think
that's necessary.

27:41.050 --> 27:42.138
I do.

27:42.182 --> 27:43.574
Ah, it's gonna happen
sooner or later.

27:43.618 --> 27:45.272
That's right. Dad?

27:45.315 --> 27:49.145
I particularly liked
this lasagna.

27:49.189 --> 27:51.147
What's a code blue?

27:51.191 --> 27:53.367
It means it's time to talk
about your wedding, Eddie.

27:53.410 --> 27:54.237
That's right.

27:54.281 --> 27:55.717
They just got engaged.

27:55.761 --> 27:57.153
Jamie tells us that you want

27:57.197 --> 27:59.242
this big church to-do,
all the bells and whistles.

27:59.286 --> 28:02.332
Oh, I don't remember
saying that.ERIN: Great. That's great.

28:02.376 --> 28:04.204
We're gonna need a huge
venue for the reception.

28:04.247 --> 28:06.249
Huge? How huge
are we talking?

28:06.293 --> 28:07.773
Really big.
Yeah, big.

28:07.816 --> 28:09.644
I mean, uh, the police
commissioner's guest list alone

28:09.688 --> 28:11.472
is gonna be a couple hundred
people, right, Dad?

28:11.515 --> 28:14.388
Jamie and I haven't made
any firm decisions yet.

28:14.431 --> 28:16.651
But that's what family is for.
We're here for you.

28:16.695 --> 28:17.957
Every step of the way.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.915
You're gonna look so
beautiful in Mom's dress.

28:19.959 --> 28:22.265
You're gonna be gorgeous.Oh, God.

28:24.746 --> 28:26.313
Mom's dress?

28:26.356 --> 28:28.184
The train's kind of long,
but once you get moving

28:28.228 --> 28:30.360
you'll get used to it.This dress is made for you.

28:30.404 --> 28:32.232
Perfect.I mean, it's the most beautiful
dress anyone's ever seen.

28:32.275 --> 28:33.668
Stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop!

28:37.237 --> 28:40.806
I'm glad you're all very
excited, but this is my wedding.

28:40.849 --> 28:41.937
Ours.

28:41.981 --> 28:44.592
And we're gonna make
all the decisions:

28:44.635 --> 28:46.855
the flowers,
the guest list,

28:46.899 --> 28:48.901
dress, band, menu, all of it.

28:48.944 --> 28:50.554
Your job, all due respect,

28:50.598 --> 28:51.947
is to show up

28:51.991 --> 28:53.514
and have a blast.

28:53.557 --> 28:55.385
If anybody can't live with that,

28:55.429 --> 28:56.778
I'll send you pictures.

28:56.822 --> 28:58.562
Okay?

29:04.351 --> 29:05.744
Okay.

29:06.788 --> 29:07.746
Brava.

29:10.096 --> 29:12.446
Good for you.Well done.

29:12.489 --> 29:13.839
Did I miss something?

29:13.882 --> 29:16.102
Reagan family tradition.

29:16.145 --> 29:17.973
Not our kindest.

29:18.017 --> 29:20.367
You see, anyone that marries
into the family always starts

29:20.410 --> 29:21.324
on their best behavior.

29:21.368 --> 29:22.761
Which gets old fast.

29:22.804 --> 29:23.936
DANNY: Yeah, so then
we call a code blue.

29:23.979 --> 29:25.154
We come up with something

29:25.198 --> 29:26.852
that's gonna be a
sensitive topic for you,

29:26.895 --> 29:28.636
then bust your chops about
it till your head explodes,

29:28.679 --> 29:30.377
which yours just did.

29:30.420 --> 29:33.510
Yeah, and your tantrum was
way better than Linda's.

29:33.554 --> 29:35.469
Or Jack's.

29:35.512 --> 29:38.341
: I can't believe
you didn't tell me.

29:38.385 --> 29:40.343
A spouse-to-be is
sworn to secrecy.

29:40.387 --> 29:42.693
Well, I think it's sneaky.

29:42.737 --> 29:44.434
HENRY: Yeah, but there's
a good reason for it.

29:44.478 --> 29:46.262
We don't stand on ceremony here.

29:46.306 --> 29:48.090
We tell each other
the truth.

29:48.134 --> 29:51.790
Sometimes the hard truth,
but it's all done with love.

29:51.833 --> 29:52.965
:
That's right.

29:53.008 --> 29:55.358
And you're a part
of that now, Eddie.

29:55.402 --> 29:58.927
Hmm. So you're saying
you don't care if I can cook

29:58.971 --> 30:00.624
as long as I can fight?

30:00.668 --> 30:02.017
Yeah.

30:02.061 --> 30:04.237
Again, welcome to the family.

30:05.542 --> 30:07.022
Hear, hear.

30:08.023 --> 30:09.285
Cheers.

30:09.329 --> 30:11.026
Cheers.

30:19.382 --> 30:21.602
I've just wanted this job
for so long.

30:21.645 --> 30:23.647
You know?

30:23.691 --> 30:26.259
The chance to put my stamp
on the trial division.

30:26.302 --> 30:27.434
And you've earned it.

30:27.477 --> 30:32.439
I think I underestimated
the politics.

30:32.482 --> 30:35.007
Anyone I know?

30:35.050 --> 30:38.271
Chief Assistant D.A. Whitney.

30:38.314 --> 30:41.361
Okay.

30:41.404 --> 30:44.712
He bullied Monica Graham into
letting one of his VIP pals

30:44.755 --> 30:47.671
walk on an open and shut
assault charge.

30:47.715 --> 30:49.064
And what are you
gonna do about it?

30:49.108 --> 30:52.502
Walk into Whitney's office,

30:52.546 --> 30:54.374
tell him I'm gonna
charge the jerk

30:54.417 --> 30:56.376
and then probably
get demoted or fired.

30:56.419 --> 30:57.594
Then don't do it.

31:00.423 --> 31:01.990
Then what

31:02.034 --> 31:04.906
Well, it's one thing
to win a job.

31:04.950 --> 31:07.343
It's another thing and a much
harder thing to keep it.

31:07.387 --> 31:11.434
And when you say "politics,"
you mean office politics?

31:11.478 --> 31:12.566
Yeah.

31:12.609 --> 31:14.220
Well, what about
racial politics?

31:14.263 --> 31:15.569
Gender politics?

31:15.612 --> 31:18.050
Whitney is a white guy.
Monica was a black female.

31:18.093 --> 31:19.921
So

31:19.965 --> 31:23.142
Well, I'm just saying,
with a guy like Whitney,

31:23.185 --> 31:26.493
would this situation
be the same situation

31:26.536 --> 31:27.929
if Monica were a white guy?

31:27.973 --> 31:29.539
Would he still
have bullied her?

31:29.583 --> 31:31.933
I... it's hard to know.

31:31.977 --> 31:33.543
Oh, come on. What do you think?

31:33.587 --> 31:37.721
Probably not, but you can't
reverse engineer it that way.

31:37.765 --> 31:42.248
But it is kind of the accepted
enlightenment of our age,

31:42.291 --> 31:44.380
that everything
has to be examined

31:44.424 --> 31:48.384
through a whole rainbow
of lenses.

31:48.428 --> 31:51.213
These from
the same bottle?

31:53.476 --> 31:55.391
Yeah.

31:55.435 --> 31:59.047
Then that's very funny,
coming from you.

32:16.891 --> 32:18.501
Ronnie, you got a sec?

32:18.545 --> 32:20.460
I'll have the guest list for the
Gracie Mansion event any minute.

32:20.503 --> 32:23.985
Yeah, that can wait. These are
Detectives Reagan and Baez.

32:24.029 --> 32:26.727
The commissioner's son?
Wow, they must be...

32:28.120 --> 32:30.426
Anyway, can I help you?

32:30.470 --> 32:33.125
You're responsible for planning
the PC's press avails?

32:33.168 --> 32:34.430
24/7.

32:34.474 --> 32:35.736
Uh, don't.

32:35.779 --> 32:37.694
The commissioner's schedule
is confidential.

32:37.738 --> 32:38.913
You know that, right?

32:38.957 --> 32:40.088
Of course.

32:40.132 --> 32:41.655
And you wouldn't e-mail it
to anyone else?

32:41.698 --> 32:42.786
Absolutely not.

32:42.830 --> 32:44.527
Not even to yourself?

32:44.571 --> 32:47.661
GARRETT: That's a
breach of protocol.

32:47.704 --> 32:50.011
That schedule's never to be sent
to an unsecured account.

32:50.055 --> 32:53.275
I know. I just...
I get calls all night long.

32:53.319 --> 32:54.973
Reporters,
PR people,

32:55.016 --> 32:56.278
Commissioner Moore.

32:56.322 --> 32:59.325
So you forward the PC's
confidential schedule

32:59.368 --> 33:00.761
to your private cell phone?

33:00.804 --> 33:02.632
Just for backup, in case
I can't find my work phone.

33:02.676 --> 33:04.112
Ever heard of a hard copy?

33:04.156 --> 33:05.679
You mean, like, on paper?

33:07.202 --> 33:08.769
We have reason to believe

33:08.812 --> 33:10.379
your personal account's
been hacked.

33:10.423 --> 33:15.123
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
Am I gonna go to jail?

33:15.167 --> 33:16.820
No, you're not going to jail,

33:16.864 --> 33:19.214
but you're not gonna be hired
for head of security, either.

33:19.258 --> 33:20.911
Could we talk?

33:22.957 --> 33:26.613
There's always gonna be beefs,
but this code of silence,

33:26.656 --> 33:28.528
that ends now.

33:28.571 --> 33:30.704
Respectfully, easier
said than done, boss.

33:30.747 --> 33:32.923
All participants
in yesterday's incident

33:32.967 --> 33:35.796
and onlookers are transferred
out as of today.

33:35.839 --> 33:39.669
That sends a message,
but, uh, boss, your call--

33:39.713 --> 33:41.019
Officer Jordan is a good cop.

33:41.062 --> 33:43.325
Give him a rip,
but I'd like to hold onto him.

33:43.369 --> 33:45.414
Okay. Also,

33:45.458 --> 33:46.937
One PP approved the list
of officers

33:46.981 --> 33:49.636
that you recommended
from your old precinct.

33:49.679 --> 33:51.507
All five will be reporting

33:51.551 --> 33:53.248
as soon as the paperwork
goes through.

33:53.292 --> 33:54.815
Hopefully change
the culture around here.

33:54.858 --> 33:56.469
Great, boss. Thanks.

33:56.512 --> 33:58.210
But I think I put
six names on that list.

33:58.253 --> 33:59.428
Yeah, one officer

33:59.472 --> 34:01.691
will not be coming over,
an Officer Janko.

34:01.735 --> 34:04.172
One PP say why?

34:04.216 --> 34:06.609
Above my pay grade.

34:11.397 --> 34:12.746
You wanted to see me?

34:12.789 --> 34:15.009
Yes, but I would've come to you.That's all right.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.663
I heard it was urgent.

34:16.706 --> 34:20.667
Um, I wanted to discuss
Billy Conroy.

34:20.710 --> 34:22.321
Refresh me.

34:22.364 --> 34:24.627
Mr. Conroy assaulted
a young woman seven months ago,

34:24.671 --> 34:25.846
Cara Simpson.

34:25.889 --> 34:28.370
He should've been
prosecuted, he wasn't,

34:28.414 --> 34:29.893
and now he's done it again.

34:29.937 --> 34:32.200
Find out who screwed up,
rip him or her a new one.

34:32.244 --> 34:33.593
That is what
the bureau chief does.

34:33.636 --> 34:35.116
Right, but I have evidence

34:35.160 --> 34:37.597
that someone
in the position

34:37.640 --> 34:41.296
to do so interceded
on Mr. Conroy's behalf.

34:41.340 --> 34:43.603
Someone from this office.

34:50.871 --> 34:52.394
I see.

34:52.438 --> 34:54.048
I thought it was Monica Graham.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.484
But it wasn't.

34:55.528 --> 34:58.270
No, so I climbed
the ladder.

34:58.313 --> 35:01.186
And other than my office,
that only leads to one place.

35:01.229 --> 35:02.665
I'm not naming names.

35:02.709 --> 35:05.886
No, but you're not exactly
staying silent, either.

35:05.929 --> 35:07.975
No, sir.

35:08.018 --> 35:11.239
Using the power of this office
to excuse criminal behavior

35:11.283 --> 35:12.936
based on personal
relationships

35:12.980 --> 35:14.503
is reprehensible.

35:14.547 --> 35:16.679
I agree.

35:18.681 --> 35:22.163
But he won't go quietly.

35:22.207 --> 35:24.687
And he's gonna do

35:24.731 --> 35:26.820
a lot of damage on his way out.

35:26.863 --> 35:28.604
Which is why
I brought this to you.

35:28.648 --> 35:30.432
If you prefer,

35:30.476 --> 35:33.261
I can handle this myself.

35:33.305 --> 35:37.918
But you know,
coming from a family of cops,

35:37.961 --> 35:40.094
that when you are faced
with a bomb,

35:40.138 --> 35:42.879
you stand back
and call the Bomb Squad.

35:42.923 --> 35:45.447
Or certainly alert them.

35:47.188 --> 35:50.713
Thank you.

36:00.941 --> 36:01.898
That your truck?

36:01.942 --> 36:04.640
Detective Nuciforo, PC's office.

36:04.684 --> 36:06.903
Commissioner's inside
getting a shave and a haircut.

36:06.947 --> 36:09.036
We'll be out of here
in ten or 15 minutes.

36:18.088 --> 36:19.264
Ronnie?

36:20.613 --> 36:22.484
What the hell
are you doing here?

36:26.053 --> 36:27.097
Gun!

36:30.579 --> 36:32.146
On the ground!Police! Don't move!

36:32.190 --> 36:33.800
Get down!Gun.

36:33.843 --> 36:35.018
I got him.You all right?

36:35.062 --> 36:37.064
Yeah.

36:40.241 --> 36:41.851
Call him a bus.

36:52.819 --> 36:53.820
Hey.

36:53.863 --> 36:57.737
Hey. How you doing?It never ends.

36:57.780 --> 36:59.913
What are you
talking about?

36:59.956 --> 37:01.480
I asked for
specific officers

37:01.523 --> 37:03.482
to be transferred to the 2-9,
and you were one of them.

37:03.525 --> 37:04.744
Yeah, I heard.

37:04.787 --> 37:06.180
I'm gonna take this
straight to my dad.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.313
This is between
him and me.
No, it's not.

37:08.356 --> 37:11.881
I asked to not be transferred.

37:14.493 --> 37:16.886
You did?

37:16.930 --> 37:21.282
Maybe your dad is... right
about us not working together.

37:21.326 --> 37:22.718
How's that?

37:22.762 --> 37:26.809
I worked really hard
to be a good cop.

37:26.853 --> 37:28.942
It's something that I did.

37:28.985 --> 37:32.815
It's mine, and I'm proud of it.

37:32.859 --> 37:34.513
I don't want to lose it.

37:34.556 --> 37:37.603
Who says you have to?

37:37.646 --> 37:42.390
Look, I fell in love
with Jamie Reagan,

37:42.434 --> 37:44.871
and the Jamie part's easy.

37:44.914 --> 37:49.223
He's my partner and my lover,
my best friend.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.834
But the Reagan part?

37:54.315 --> 37:56.274
I might need some distance.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.800
I don't want to disappear.

38:06.501 --> 38:07.937
Well, judging from how
you handled

38:07.981 --> 38:10.288
that code blue
the other night at dinner,

38:10.331 --> 38:12.377
I think you're
gonna do just fine.

38:12.420 --> 38:15.075
I did kind of destroy you guys.

38:15.118 --> 38:16.511
Yeah, big-time.

38:16.555 --> 38:18.513
Yeah.

38:18.557 --> 38:20.820
I love you.

38:22.778 --> 38:24.911
I love you, too.

38:50.502 --> 38:52.373
You want to frisk me?
I'm clean, I swear.

38:52.417 --> 38:54.549
Get in there.

38:54.593 --> 38:57.030
First year
on the task force...

38:57.073 --> 38:58.423
Get your hands up.

38:58.466 --> 39:01.164
...we raided this family-run
meth lab in East Harlem.

39:01.208 --> 39:02.209
Okay.

39:02.252 --> 39:04.864
Six dead, one survived.

39:04.907 --> 39:06.039
It was this eight-year-old kid

39:06.082 --> 39:08.302
in superhero pajamas

39:08.346 --> 39:10.304
hiding in the closet.

39:10.348 --> 39:11.958
I kind of adopted him.

39:12.001 --> 39:15.004
You talking about Ronnie?

39:15.048 --> 39:18.094
Raised him,
raised him good, too.

39:18.138 --> 39:20.836
You must've raised him, but he's
cleared to work at One PP.

39:20.880 --> 39:22.360
What was he doing,

39:22.403 --> 39:23.796
tipping you off about
the old man's movements?

39:23.839 --> 39:25.014
Look, I should've
not have asked him

39:25.058 --> 39:27.843
to get me those itineraries.

39:27.887 --> 39:30.237
And when you realized, being
the smart cop that you are,

39:30.280 --> 39:31.543
you're not gonna get by me.

39:31.586 --> 39:34.415
I told him last night,
I'm letting it go.

39:34.459 --> 39:37.113
He take it upon himself
to do you a solid?

39:37.157 --> 39:38.419
Is that what happened?

39:38.463 --> 39:40.290
You wanted to get
the old man,

39:40.334 --> 39:44.643
but you hit
your own boy instead.

39:44.686 --> 39:46.079
What were you thinking?

39:48.560 --> 39:49.996
Can I see him?

39:56.611 --> 39:59.440
He's cuffed to the bed rail.

39:59.484 --> 40:02.051
Don't think of doing
anything crazy.

40:03.096 --> 40:04.880
Go.

40:10.495 --> 40:13.323
I interviewed Paula Thompson
again myself.

40:13.367 --> 40:14.499
I also conducted

40:14.542 --> 40:16.370
a second interview
with Detective Palmer,

40:16.414 --> 40:18.067
and I felt that
Ms. Thompson's

40:18.111 --> 40:19.939
impressions were confirmed.

40:19.982 --> 40:23.029
May I ask,

40:23.072 --> 40:24.900
what was different
about your approach

40:24.944 --> 40:28.034
that led you to
the opposite conclusion?

40:28.077 --> 40:29.296
No, you may not.

40:30.993 --> 40:33.605
Detective Palmer
will be reassigned

40:33.648 --> 40:35.998
out of Special Victims,
and I will personally call

40:36.042 --> 40:38.827
Ms. Thompson
to give her the news.

40:41.439 --> 40:45.704
And to apologize.

40:45.747 --> 40:50.056
I'm sure she'll appreciate that,
as do I.

40:50.099 --> 40:53.755
Well, actually, Detective Baker
deserves the credit.

40:55.670 --> 40:59.457
Yes, of course.
Thank you very much, Detective.

41:01.241 --> 41:03.983
And thank you, Frank.

41:05.898 --> 41:07.116
It's a good start.

41:14.384 --> 41:17.213
Okay, look.

41:17.257 --> 41:19.999
I am not about to transfer good,

41:20.042 --> 41:22.088
specially trained detectives

41:22.131 --> 41:26.788
because of their gender, but...
what I can do

41:26.832 --> 41:31.053
is create a panel to assess
Special Victims protocols

41:31.097 --> 41:32.968
and recommend improvements.

41:36.755 --> 41:39.018
And I want you to sit on.

41:41.499 --> 41:43.501
Thank you, sir.

41:50.899 --> 41:52.335
And, Baker?

41:54.468 --> 41:57.993
That was good police work,
Detective.

42:00.953 --> 42:02.476
For a girl.
