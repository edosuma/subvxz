22:21.925 --> 22:23.093
who's gonna be shy,

22:23.176 --> 22:25.012
you're young, you're beautiful,
you gotta find somebody else.

22:25.095 --> 22:26.680
You gotta go out and get
some friends, all right?

22:26.763 --> 22:28.265
I don't like going out.
You know that

22:28.348 --> 22:30.434
I get anxiety when I
have to meet people.

22:30.517 --> 22:32.519
You know how hard that is.

22:32.602 --> 22:35.647
You cannot just stay in the
house with a fucking sun lamp.

22:35.731 --> 22:36.815
All right?

22:36.898 --> 22:40.110
And I can't... I mean, look, I can't
trust you with Danny when you...

22:40.193 --> 22:41.319
That fire and everything...

22:41.403 --> 22:42.487
I can't trust to
leave you alone.

22:42.571 --> 22:43.530
I put the fire out,
Irving.

22:43.613 --> 22:45.532
There is no fire.
Maybe if you were here more,

22:45.615 --> 22:47.367
then there wouldn't have been
a fire in the first place.

22:47.451 --> 22:49.244
Oh, what, there wouldn't have
been a fire if I was here?

22:49.327 --> 22:52.039
Just stop with the whole fire thing!
God! it was a mistake!

22:52.122 --> 22:53.749
I'm sure a million people
do that, all the time.

22:53.832 --> 22:55.417
Those sun lamps
are dangerous.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.794
Shouldn't even have them
in the house, really.

22:58.545 --> 23:00.380
I bet that happens
all the time.

23:01.548 --> 23:03.467
This was nothing.

23:04.801 --> 23:06.762
We're not happy,
all right?

23:10.891 --> 23:12.267
You know that I
could take Danny,

23:12.350 --> 23:13.977
you know that most of
your work is illegal,

23:14.061 --> 23:15.896
and you know that if you tried
to divorce me, you know that...

23:15.979 --> 23:18.899
I'm not saying that I would,
but I'm saying that I could,

23:18.982 --> 23:22.027
and I'm saying that that is why
I don't like divorce, Irving.

23:22.110 --> 23:23.487
Women do that in divorces.

23:23.570 --> 23:26.448
Women get the children and then
the fathers never see them.

23:26.823 --> 23:28.325
My mother never got divorced.

23:28.408 --> 23:29.785
My grandmother
never got divorced.

23:29.868 --> 23:31.411
There are no
divorces in my family.

23:31.495 --> 23:33.205
I am not getting a divorce.

23:33.288 --> 23:34.414
Come on,
what are we doing here?

23:34.498 --> 23:37.501
We fight and we fuck and that's what we do.
That's our thing.

23:37.584 --> 23:40.087
<i>IRVING: She was the Picasso
of passive-aggressive karate.</i>

23:40.170 --> 23:41.129
Come here. Come here.

23:41.213 --> 23:45.133
<i>IRVING: She was better than any con
artist I ever met, including myself,</i>

23:45.217 --> 23:47.511
<i>and she had me
like nobody had me.</i>

23:47.761 --> 23:50.013
Irving, come to mama,
come on.

23:50.097 --> 23:51.932
<i>IRVING:
You might say she was my karma</i>

23:52.015 --> 23:53.600
<i>for how I took
advantage of people.</i>

23:53.683 --> 23:54.684
Irving...

23:57.020 --> 23:58.814
Oh, my God.

23:58.897 --> 24:00.440
Come here. Come on.

24:00.565 --> 24:01.608
Get into bed.

24:01.691 --> 24:02.692
All right.

24:02.776 --> 24:04.611
Baby,
there's such good stuff here.

24:04.694 --> 24:07.114
<i>IRVING: I did not want
to leave the kid behind.</i>

24:07.197 --> 24:08.740
<i>He was my son!</i>

24:09.407 --> 24:12.285
<i>She had me. I was her mark.</i>

24:13.370 --> 24:16.164
Now, I can't assure you that
your loan will be approved,

24:16.248 --> 24:19.459
but I can tell you that
any deal I take, I close.

24:19.543 --> 24:22.963
However,
my fee is nonrefundable,

24:23.046 --> 24:24.548
just like my time.

24:26.591 --> 24:28.969
I want to thank you very
much, Irving, for seeing me.

24:29.052 --> 24:30.637
I'm sorry I'm so nervous.

24:31.304 --> 24:32.889
Is that...
Am I not buttoned?

24:35.142 --> 24:38.353
I just got to say, Mr. Rosenfeld,
that Lady Edith was

24:39.312 --> 24:40.981
very adamant that
you were top-notch.

24:41.064 --> 24:42.274
That's correct.

24:42.357 --> 24:43.733
I really need your help,
I'm desperate.

24:44.568 --> 24:45.944
I mean, I got the Audis

24:46.027 --> 24:49.072
and two boats,
and I forgot to mention

24:49.156 --> 24:52.242
that I have a little piece
of real estate in Long Island.

24:52.325 --> 24:53.410
SYDNEY:
No, you didn't mention that.

24:53.493 --> 24:55.620
Two lunches and you
never mentioned that.

24:56.079 --> 24:58.832
I was gonna mention it, then the
guy with the hat walked in.

24:58.915 --> 25:00.125
The hat?
You remember that?

25:00.208 --> 25:02.669
I forgot, I totally...
I do remember.

25:03.378 --> 25:04.713
It was the second
time we had lunch.

25:04.796 --> 25:06.047
Yes. (CHUCKLES)

25:06.131 --> 25:07.716
I thought he was...
You couldn't see his eyes.

25:07.799 --> 25:09.217
It was like he had no eyes.

25:09.342 --> 25:10.927
Do they sell hats like that?
I don't know.

25:11.011 --> 25:12.429
It's like he made it.
Where do they come from?

25:12.554 --> 25:14.514
He's a great milliner.
Actually, I went to the store.

25:14.598 --> 25:15.765
I saw a hat store
down the street.

25:15.932 --> 25:17.017
I thought maybe
he bought it there,

25:17.100 --> 25:19.019
and I was gonna get you one,
as, like, a memento.

25:19.102 --> 25:20.979
Two lunches?
SYDNEY: Yes.

25:21.062 --> 25:22.439
Really?
It's two lunches.

25:22.522 --> 25:24.316
What's the big deal?
That's unusual.

25:24.399 --> 25:26.359
I was trying to get him
to be more aggressive.

25:26.443 --> 25:27.527
On his loan, that is.

25:27.611 --> 25:30.113
You showed me a whole new side of
the city I'd never seen before.

25:30.197 --> 25:31.239
Yeah, it's...

25:31.323 --> 25:32.532
You're welcome.

25:32.616 --> 25:34.576
No. Thank you.

25:34.784 --> 25:36.912
Yeah, right.
Should I take you there?

25:36.995 --> 25:38.496
Yeah, it's nice.
You liked it?

25:38.580 --> 25:40.165
All right, should I
take you there twice?

25:40.248 --> 25:41.583
Stop.

25:45.295 --> 25:47.339
(MUTTERING) What are you doing?
What?

25:47.422 --> 25:49.341
You like this guy?
Yes, I like this guy.

25:49.424 --> 25:50.717
Is this messing
with your judgment?

25:50.800 --> 25:52.010
No, it's not
messing with my judgment.

25:52.093 --> 25:53.803
Don't be stupid.
Hey, hey, hey.

25:53.887 --> 25:54.930
Look at me.

25:55.013 --> 25:56.431
Play your part.

25:57.015 --> 25:59.226
Fine, you play your part.

25:59.309 --> 26:00.894
Well, take it to
your people in London.

26:00.977 --> 26:02.979
Please, take it to them.

26:05.023 --> 26:07.067
I got the cashier's
check right here.

26:08.735 --> 26:11.279
I give you five, and you
give me 50 back, right?

26:11.363 --> 26:12.614
Please.

26:14.282 --> 26:15.575
Please don't reject me.

You got an office in Zurich?

26:28.672 --> 26:29.881

Excuse me for a second.

26:31.007 --> 26:32.008
Yeah, take your time.
Excuse me.

26:32.092 --> 26:33.260
Yeah. It's...
Just be one moment.

for a little bit.

all right?

On fraud?

Yeah, she may not be...

26:58.034 --> 26:59.244

banking connections,

26:59.369 --> 27:00.954

don't have to cuff me up.

How long is that?
That's three to five years.

you, I don't know.

off the beaten path.

you know him.

very few people on a short list.

30:58.525 --> 31:00.026
I want to go after
white-collar crime.

31:00.109 --> 31:01.986
Irving, you're very skilled,

31:02.070 --> 31:04.072
and I want you to teach me,
and we can do this.

31:04.155 --> 31:05.490
I want four people
that do what you do.

31:05.573 --> 31:08.034
Fraudulent investments,
fake certificates of deposit,

31:08.117 --> 31:09.202

31:09.285 --> 31:11.371
You get me four people,
and you're off the hook.

31:11.454 --> 31:12.789
Four busts,

31:13.957 --> 31:15.875

Anything you want.

then your life's over.

it's gonna be very difficult

to live in this country.

to run, and we need to do it now.

Right, we'll go to Estonia
or Romania, I don't care,

31:35.311 --> 31:36.437

the cash from the bed,

31:36.563 --> 31:37.647

all right?

about it 100 times.

I gave him my name.

him with Rosalyn.

That is a manipulation.

31:46.573 --> 31:47.949
Rosalyn will never let you go.

31:48.074 --> 31:49.367
She'll use Danny
against you because

31:49.450 --> 31:51.911
she's too messed
up to let you leave.

31:53.121 --> 31:55.331
I can't leave him.

31:56.207 --> 31:57.500
He's my son.

would say that.

39:42.381 --> 39:43.424
(LOUD CHATTER)

39:43.549 --> 39:46.302
<i>They even adopted some
other kid, a black kid</i>

39:46.385 --> 39:49.388
<i>from the Boys and Girls Club
who'd lost his family.</i>

39:49.472 --> 39:52.308
<i>I mean, his household
was a joyous place.</i>

39:52.391 --> 39:55.436
<i>And his wife, Dolly, well,
she was the apple of his eye.</i>

39:56.645 --> 39:59.023
<i>And the center
of the household.</i>

39:59.106 --> 40:01.609
<i>I mean,
everyone loved this guy.</i>

40:03.152 --> 40:04.987
<i>And he had a huge heart.</i>

40:05.488 --> 40:09.867
CARMINE: The WPA employed craftsmen
to paint this during the Depression.

40:09.950 --> 40:12.536
Why can't we
employ people today

40:12.620 --> 40:15.414
to do work like this
in rebuilding Atlantic City?

40:15.498 --> 40:17.083
<i>RICHIE:
He worked with all the unions,</i>

40:17.166 --> 40:18.876
<i>he was the leader of
the State Assembly,</i>

40:18.959 --> 40:20.503
<i>and he had just
gotten gambling legalized</i>

40:20.586 --> 40:22.588
<i>in New Jersey to create jobs.</i>

40:22.671 --> 40:25.508
<i>But he couldn't get the funds
to rebuild Atlantic City.</i>

40:26.717 --> 40:28.010
<i>And that was his problem.</i>

40:28.094 --> 40:30.513
<i>So, with our help,
he was about to have his hand</i>

40:30.596 --> 40:32.515
<i>in the wrong pocket
at the wrong time.</i>

40:32.598 --> 40:34.767
<i>And to me, that meant corrupt.</i>

40:36.936 --> 40:38.312
STODDARD: You said grifters,
con artists.

40:38.395 --> 40:40.231
We're not going
after some politician.

40:40.314 --> 40:42.149
This is a bad idea, Richard.

40:42.233 --> 40:43.859
Look, it's really simple.

40:43.943 --> 40:47.571
All you need is to put two
million in a Chase account...

40:47.655 --> 40:49.365
What?
...under the sheik's name.

40:49.448 --> 40:50.783
Whose $2 million?

40:50.866 --> 40:52.743
Just listen.

40:52.827 --> 40:55.371
$2 million under
the sheik's name

40:55.454 --> 40:58.666
in a Chase account
that we control.

40:58.749 --> 41:02.169
Carmine calls up
on the telephone,

41:02.253 --> 41:05.131
calls the bank and he sees
that the sheik is real

41:05.214 --> 41:06.674
and he has a real account.

41:06.757 --> 41:08.467
Five days.

41:08.551 --> 41:11.512
I'm not taking $2 million
of the taxpayers' money,

41:11.595 --> 41:13.597
putting it anywhere
for five days.

41:13.681 --> 41:15.141
I don't care if we
control it the whole time.

41:15.224 --> 41:18.144
Stoddard, let us do what we need
to do to rule out corruption

41:18.227 --> 41:20.354
and to get rid
of the payoff guys

41:20.437 --> 41:22.481
that are ruining this country.
That's my dream.

41:22.565 --> 41:24.275
Don't smother it, please.
You know, Richard,

41:24.358 --> 41:25.651
I understand your eagerness.

41:25.734 --> 41:27.319
I really do.

41:27.403 --> 41:29.113
You know I'm from Michigan,
right?

41:29.196 --> 41:30.614
Let me tell you a story

41:30.698 --> 41:32.741
about me and my
dad and my brother.

41:32.825 --> 41:34.952
We used to go ice
fishing every November.

41:35.035 --> 41:36.162
Ice fishing,
that's all anybody...

41:36.245 --> 41:37.454
That's what we lived for.

41:37.538 --> 41:38.998
Holy shit.
Just listen to me.

41:39.081 --> 41:40.666
It's beautiful.
You have a little stove.

41:40.749 --> 41:42.668
You huddle around,
you keep each other warm.

41:42.751 --> 41:45.129
You drop a line
and you just wait.

41:45.212 --> 41:47.173
One year,
my brother says,

41:47.256 --> 41:48.507
"Let's go in October."

41:48.591 --> 41:50.176
He wants to go
ice fishing in October.

41:50.259 --> 41:52.094
My dad says,
"No, the ice is too thin."

41:52.178 --> 41:53.929
My brother says,
I love my brother, he says...

41:54.096 --> 41:55.431
I understand. Your brother
went out on the ice,

41:55.514 --> 41:57.016
the ice was too thin,
he fell through the ice,

41:57.099 --> 41:58.809
he went in the water
'cause he was too eager,

41:58.893 --> 42:00.561
and you're saying I'm too eager.
That's what you're saying?

42:00.644 --> 42:01.854
No, that's not
what I'm saying.

42:01.937 --> 42:03.272
What are you saying?

42:03.355 --> 42:04.690
You know,
we'll finish the ice story

42:04.773 --> 42:06.859
another time, young man.

42:06.942 --> 42:09.028
For now, no Carmine Polito.

42:09.111 --> 42:10.863
Go do your job.

42:10.946 --> 42:12.323
<i>RICHIE: Stoddard shot
the whole thing down.</i>

42:12.406 --> 42:13.782

42:14.200 --> 42:15.367
<i>But Edith was a genius.</i>

42:15.451 --> 42:17.119
Yeah, you take me to Brenda.

42:17.203 --> 42:20.831
<i>RICHIE: She somehow found this woman
who controlled the wire room.</i>

42:20.915 --> 42:23.292
<i>A woman I'd
never even heard of.</i>

42:23.375 --> 42:25.878
She's amazing. She's in charge
of all the wire transfers.

42:25.961 --> 42:29.006
<i>RICHIE: Way back in</i> a <i>warren
buried in the Bureau.</i>

42:29.089 --> 42:30.466
She likes cats.

42:30.549 --> 42:32.968
<i>This cat lady no one
ever even talked to.</i>

42:33.052 --> 42:37.348
<i>And Edith met her in the ladies'
room and became friends with her.</i>

42:37.431 --> 42:39.141
Brenda? Hi.

42:39.225 --> 42:40.809
Hello.
How are you?

42:40.893 --> 42:42.478
<i>RICHIE: This lady
handled all the wires,</i>

42:42.561 --> 42:43.896
<i>and now she was
working with us.</i>

42:43.979 --> 42:46.482
<i>She was excited to be
included in an operation</i>

42:46.565 --> 42:47.983
<i>instead of just being
on the other end of a memo.</i>

42:48.067 --> 42:49.485
You said you liked
exotic booze, so...

42:49.568 --> 42:50.736
<i>It was beautiful.
That's from England.</i>

42:50.819 --> 42:52.363
This is from England?
Yeah.

42:52.446 --> 42:54.156
That's right. And I brought
you some tea as well.

42:54.240 --> 42:55.532
Oh, thank you so much.
I mean, nobody

42:55.616 --> 42:57.243
ever talks to me.
I know.

42:57.326 --> 42:59.578
I mean, they just say, "Brenda,
do the clerical wiring stuff

42:59.662 --> 43:01.205
"and don't ask questions."

43:01.288 --> 43:02.706
You need to tell
Richie about your cats.

43:02.790 --> 43:03.874
Oh, my cats?
He loves cats.

43:03.958 --> 43:05.125

Yeah.

43:05.209 --> 43:06.293
Well, that's Harry.

43:06.377 --> 43:08.504
Look at him standing up!
Isn't that sweet?

43:08.587 --> 43:11.215
And that's Wendy.
She's a rascal.

43:11.298 --> 43:13.259
But Barnaby,
that's another story.

43:13.342 --> 43:15.177
Barnaby plays the piano.

43:15.261 --> 43:17.304
That's impressive.

43:17.388 --> 43:20.975
<i>We got her to wire $2 million into

<i>it was his own idea or he'd look
stupid in front of his boss.</i>

from my boss for thanking me

never should have happened,

a little power-drunk, Richard.

ruining America, not me.

44:41.096 --> 44:42.681
How the fuck am I
ruining America?

44:42.765 --> 44:45.225
Because people just got over
Watergate and Vietnam, all right,

44:45.309 --> 44:47.603
and you're going to shit all
over politicians again?

44:47.686 --> 44:49.772
And just because you want to be
a big shot, get a promotion.

44:49.855 --> 44:51.857
No. I'm thinking big, all right?

45:05.412 --> 45:07.039
You don't know it,
all right?

45:07.122 --> 45:09.208
That's the fucking
art of becoming somebody

45:09.291 --> 45:13.212
who people can pin their
beliefs and their dreams on.

45:13.295 --> 45:15.089

you got to knock him off of
his fucking feet, all right?

of millions of dollars

45:46.328 --> 45:47.913
That's gigantic, all right?

45:47.996 --> 45:50.082
And the mayor, he's going
to want to see cash,

45:50.165 --> 45:52.167
he's going to want to
see it in an account,

45:52.251 --> 45:54.920
he's going to want to see it
right now, and he will check.

45:55.003 --> 45:56.672

meeting isn't happening.

$2 million for three days.

01:04:51.764 --> 01:04:53.432

saw what my brother

01:04:53.516 --> 01:04:54.976
was doing,
he was gonna kill him.

01:04:55.059 --> 01:04:56.978
Oh, so you tried to
protect your brother,

01:04:57.061 --> 01:04:58.396

and that's why you feel bad,

01:04:58.479 --> 01:04:59.772

trying to protect me

01:04:59.855 --> 01:05:01.190

that what the story's about?

01:05:01.315 --> 01:05:03.317
It's about protection. No,
it's not about protection.

01:05:03.401 --> 01:05:04.610

(BELL DINGING)

01:37:59.625 --> 01:38:02.211
It's just hard for me to control my
passion. I'm a very passionate person.

01:38:02.294 --> 01:38:03.879
We're from New York.
You understand this.

01:38:03.963 --> 01:38:05.965
He goes ice fishing
in the Midwest.

01:38:06.340 --> 01:38:08.342
That was told
to you in confidence.

01:38:08.634 --> 01:38:11.220
He's an ice fishing guy.
Look at him.

01:38:12.888 --> 01:38:14.265
RICHIE:
What are you doing?

01:38:14.348 --> 01:38:16.392
It's not you, that's not
you with the gun. Stop it.

01:38:16.517 --> 01:38:18.435
No, it's me, it's me.

01:38:18.519 --> 01:38:20.521
Don't do something you don't
know anything about, all right?

01:38:20.646 --> 01:38:22.064
Wait, wait, put that... I'll
show you who gets shot.

01:38:22.147 --> 01:38:23.357
Do not load that gun!

01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:24.733
You drop that gun!

the Sherman Suite?

01:38:37.204 --> 01:38:39.039

01:38:41.667 --> 01:38:43.168
What happened to the Mafia?
I thought you...

01:38:43.252 --> 01:38:44.420
Yes, no, no, no, this is
where they intersect.

01:38:44.503 --> 01:38:45.796
This is where
the two things intersect.

01:38:45.879 --> 01:38:48.507
The two worlds, the
politicians and the Mafia.

01:38:48.591 --> 01:38:51.218

run Resorts International...

01:38:51.302 --> 01:38:53.262
Wait a minute. Victor
Tellegio showed his face?

01:38:53.345 --> 01:38:55.306
Yeah, I sat with
Victor Tellegio.

01:38:55.514 --> 01:38:56.515
I hung outwith him.

01:38:56.599 --> 01:38:57.933
Yeah, we can get him,

01:38:58.017 --> 01:38:59.310
we can get his
whole organization,

01:38:59.393 --> 01:39:02.938
as well as getting
any number of congressmen.

01:39:03.022 --> 01:39:04.398
I mean, that's just...

01:39:04.481 --> 01:39:06.025
That's just peeling the
first layer of the onion.

01:39:06.609 --> 01:39:07.735
Wow.

01:39:08.819 --> 01:39:10.321
How you gonna do that?

01:39:10.529 --> 01:39:12.948
We would get $10 million, that we...
$10 million?

01:39:13.032 --> 01:39:14.325
And that's how we just let
them know we're for real.

01:39:14.408 --> 01:39:15.451
$10 million?

01:39:15.534 --> 01:39:16.827
All right, so what does he
say he's gonna do for us?

01:39:16.910 --> 01:39:18.621
How are we trapping him?
They're gonna promise

01:39:18.704 --> 01:39:22.249
to build casinos, handle the
skims, do the licensing...

01:39:22.333 --> 01:39:24.960
And you have what? You have
him on tape saying this?

01:39:25.044 --> 01:39:26.879
You have that, right?
No.

01:39:27.671 --> 01:39:30.966
I want you to find a safer way to
get Victor Tellegio on a wire.

01:39:31.050 --> 01:39:32.676
No $10 million.
That's crazy.

01:39:33.260 --> 01:39:34.678
Thank you.
Right?

01:39:34.762 --> 01:39:37.139
Even to entrap Tellegio,
it's crazy.

01:39:37.222 --> 01:39:40.476
But you can have
the Sherman Suite.

01:39:40.559 --> 01:39:42.353
STODDARD: No, no.
Stoddard, please.

01:39:42.436 --> 01:39:44.813
To go and get me some congressmen.
Oh, my God.

01:39:44.897 --> 01:39:48.150
Go get some congressmen
taking bribes.

01:39:48.233 --> 01:39:50.778
I want to pinch us some
congressmen, okay?

01:39:50.861 --> 01:39:52.488
You come back to me,
I'm proud of you.

01:39:53.072 --> 01:39:54.323
Thank you.

01:39:54.823 --> 01:39:56.158
And Stoddard.

01:39:57.076 --> 01:39:58.577
Good luck keeping
your job, by the way,

01:39:58.661 --> 01:40:01.038
and staying out of jail, and
not being killed by the Mob,

01:40:01.121 --> 01:40:03.248
but otherwise,
you're doing a great job.

01:40:05.250 --> 01:40:06.210
What's the end of
the ice fishing story?

01:40:06.293 --> 01:40:07.878
I'm not telling you the end
of the ice fishing story!

01:40:07.961 --> 01:40:09.088
I'm gonna call
your fucking brother

01:40:09.171 --> 01:40:10.589
and find out the end.
My brother's dead!

01:40:10.673 --> 01:40:11.840
That's how it ends!

01:40:11.924 --> 01:40:13.258
He fell through
the fucking ice!

01:40:13.342 --> 01:40:16.887
Not, that's not... He died a
different way, many years later.

01:40:23.769 --> 01:40:25.479
RICHIE: Listen, I know
it's awkward, and, uh,

01:40:26.230 --> 01:40:28.482
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry, all right?

01:40:28.816 --> 01:40:31.527
But I think we can stick together
and, uh, still fulfill our goal.

01:40:31.610 --> 01:40:32.736
I mean,
we got the Sherman Suite.

01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:33.904
Yeah, you got
the whole floor?

01:40:33.946 --> 01:40:35.489
Got the whole floor, yeah.

01:40:36.657 --> 01:40:38.033
Yeah, you okay?

01:40:38.117 --> 01:40:39.743
Yeah. You?

01:40:39.827 --> 01:40:42.204
Yeah, you know, it's all right.
Just got hit a little bit.

01:40:42.287 --> 01:40:44.206
My eye is a little blurry.

01:40:44.289 --> 01:40:46.166
I got drops
at the pharmacy.

01:40:46.250 --> 01:40:47.835
Uh, you okay?
Yeah, I'm good.

01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:49.128

Yeah.

01:40:49.461 --> 01:40:50.796
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, Irv.

01:40:56.969 --> 01:40:58.345
You can put a camera here.

01:40:58.429 --> 01:41:01.014
Right in here, maybe,
and we get it all on film.

01:41:01.473 --> 01:41:02.725
You like it?
We do.

01:41:02.808 --> 01:41:03.851
You know what,
give me those flowers.

01:41:03.934 --> 01:41:05.936
If we put the flower vase
here, put a camera in there,

01:41:06.019 --> 01:41:07.563
and then we can get
a clear shot of the couch

01:41:07.646 --> 01:41:08.814
where we can put
the congressmen.

01:41:08.897 --> 01:41:10.065

That's the idea.

but I'm not stupid.

01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:43.755
I hear him on the phone,
arguing.

01:45:43.839 --> 01:45:45.841
He loves Carmine, but he
hates that other guy,

01:45:45.924 --> 01:45:47.926
that curly-headed
IRS guy or whatever,

01:45:48.260 --> 01:45:52.055
who's carting around my husband's
ex-lover, that redheaded whore.

01:45:52.806 --> 01:45:53.849

01:45:53.932 --> 01:45:56.184

that it drives him crazy.

What are you talking about?

01:45:59.563 --> 01:46:00.647
I hear them on the phone.

01:46:01.148 --> 01:46:04.109
I think that he's got Irv in
some sort of bind or something,

01:46:04.192 --> 01:46:06.028
and he's making him
do all of this stuff.

01:46:06.111 --> 01:46:09.156
And so Irv and Carmine right
now are at the Plaza Hotel,

01:46:09.239 --> 01:46:12.576
like, throwing all of this money
away at, like, Congress or whatever.

01:46:12.659 --> 01:46:14.327
They're giving money
to Congress or something.

overheard it on the phone.

me, what am I supposed to say?

that I was wrong,

that in real life,

01:53:12.537 --> 01:53:14.038

saying all that stuff

01:53:14.122 --> 01:53:16.875

that made you come up with this plan.

I appreciate the fact that
you all came in person,

01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:58.119
but, uh, the trip
was really unnecessary,

01:55:58.202 --> 01:56:01.873

I understand, but maybe

01:57:10.942 --> 01:57:12.276

01:57:28.459 --> 01:57:29.460

uh, privileges of protection.

What if there's obstacles?

01:57:47.061 --> 01:57:48.271
What will you do?
Obstacles...

01:57:48.354 --> 01:57:50.022
We are prepared to
overcome any obstacles.

01:57:50.106 --> 01:57:51.149

off, we'll pay somebody off.

Thank you. And I'll tell
you something else.

At the end of this, we'll
teach you how to skim

01:58:08.207 --> 01:58:10.877
and how to cut it up and
make some money on the side,

01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:12.962
