00:00.038 --> 00:02.171
<i>The '90s was
the golden age of the boy band.</i>

00:02.218 --> 00:04.828
<i>From Backstreet Boys to NSYNC,
it was an ongoing battle</i>

00:04.898 --> 00:06.648
<i>to decide which one
was king of them all.</i>

00:06.710 --> 00:09.119
<i>And at our school, the debate
raged hotter than ever.</i>

00:09.188 --> 00:10.792
Why are we even debating this?

00:10.862 --> 00:12.174
If you're gonna rank boy bands,

00:12.253 --> 00:14.164
then NSYNC has to be number one.

00:14.238 --> 00:16.779
Seriously, you're embarrassing
yourself right now.

00:16.848 --> 00:17.981
It's Backstreet Boys.

00:18.049 --> 00:19.215
It's 98 Degrees.

00:19.283 --> 00:21.217
Nick Lachey is a musical genius.

00:21.285 --> 00:22.819
You're a complete idiot, Harriet.

00:22.888 --> 00:24.854
Ms. Lewis? Never thought
I'd be saying this.

00:24.932 --> 00:26.322
Can you please
start teaching us something?

00:26.391 --> 00:28.190
He's right.
This whole argument is insane.

00:28.259 --> 00:29.191
Thank God it's over.

00:29.260 --> 00:30.760
'Cause the all-time greatest boy band

00:30.829 --> 00:31.995
is New Kids on the Block.

00:32.030 --> 00:33.262
They invented the whole formula.

00:33.331 --> 00:34.898
- Formula?
- Allow me to break it down...

00:34.966 --> 00:36.032
Wait, wait, wait, sorry, I take it back

00:36.134 --> 00:37.066
'cause I really don't care.

00:37.135 --> 00:38.934
Zip it, Weasel. This is music class,

00:39.003 --> 00:40.269
it's on topic, so take notes, guys.

00:40.338 --> 00:42.171
Every boy band has four members,

00:42.240 --> 00:44.206
each with a specific personality type.

00:44.275 --> 00:46.008
First, there's "The Dreamboat."

00:46.077 --> 00:47.243
Justin Timberlake.

00:47.345 --> 00:49.245
Correct. Next, there's "The Bad Boy."

00:49.313 --> 00:51.713
He's got edge and tattoos
and a thumb ring

00:51.782 --> 00:53.416
and a weird facial hair pattern.

00:53.484 --> 00:54.783
AJ McLean.

00:54.852 --> 00:57.153
Indeed. And of course,
there's "The Shy Guy."

00:57.188 --> 00:58.454
He's sensitive, non-threatening,

00:58.523 --> 01:00.289
and has better highlights
in his hair than you do.

01:00.358 --> 01:02.124
My man Lance Bass!

01:03.794 --> 01:04.962
Or so I've heard.

01:05.049 --> 01:08.597
And finally, every boy band has
that random, awkward older dude

01:08.666 --> 01:10.232
who just feels excited to be there.

01:10.301 --> 01:11.667
Kinda like a CB type.

01:11.735 --> 01:13.169
What... What's that, now?

01:13.271 --> 01:15.771
Oh, hey. Cool tie, see you later.

01:15.839 --> 01:18.039
Later, Alli... alligator.

01:19.076 --> 01:20.375
So, yeah, him.

01:20.477 --> 01:23.378
♪ One of these days,
you're gonna get outta here ♪

01:23.480 --> 01:26.347
♪ Live your life and finally be free ♪

01:26.450 --> 01:29.317
♪ Go where you wanna go,

01:29.419 --> 01:32.787
♪ Someday, you will say
"Those were the days" ♪

01:32.889 --> 01:34.989
<i>It was January 15th, 1990-something,</i>

01:35.092 --> 01:36.124
<i>and Glascott was scrambling</i>

01:36.226 --> 01:37.559
<i>to replace a member of the faculty.</i>

01:37.660 --> 01:40.628
Johnny G! How's the search
for the new school nurse going?

01:40.730 --> 01:41.662
Terrible.

01:41.764 --> 01:43.894
Stupid selfish Nurse Steve,
bailing on us

01:43.988 --> 01:45.433
in the middle of the school year.

01:45.535 --> 01:48.803
To join the Peace Corps and help
heal sick children in Burma.

01:48.905 --> 01:51.839
Yes, he's a hero, but we got
kids here with pink eye

01:51.941 --> 01:54.609
because they put their
dookie fingers in their eyes.

01:54.711 --> 01:56.877
You're in luck, because I happen
to know a random lady

01:56.980 --> 01:59.080
who was the pediatric nurse at Jefferson

01:59.181 --> 02:01.949
who got let go because of budget cuts.

02:02.051 --> 02:03.150
That's perfect!

02:03.252 --> 02:05.252
Come on in, random lady!

02:05.354 --> 02:06.821
Ta-da!

02:07.897 --> 02:08.823
Hi, boss.

02:08.925 --> 02:10.991
Julie. What a pleasant surprise.

02:11.094 --> 02:13.661
Her résumé speaks for itself,
but if you need a recommendation

02:13.763 --> 02:15.362
from the luckiest man on the planet,

02:15.464 --> 02:16.998
I would be happy to bend your ear.

02:17.100 --> 02:18.131
This is great.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.566
It's exciting to have you in the mix.

02:19.669 --> 02:20.868
- A Lotta options out there...
- Mm-hmm.

02:20.970 --> 02:23.037
...but I think we all know
she got the job.

02:24.483 --> 02:26.507
- No, she doesn't.
- Yeah, right.

02:26.609 --> 02:28.575
- Thanks for coming in.
- Should I just go?

02:28.678 --> 02:30.377
That'd be great.

02:30.479 --> 02:32.747
But in all seriousness,
it's a big fat no.

02:32.849 --> 02:34.348
- Wait, what?
- Seriously?

02:34.450 --> 02:35.650
You're more than qualified.

02:35.752 --> 02:38.019
But when couples work together
it never works out.

02:38.121 --> 02:40.053
But this is us. We don't even fight.

02:40.155 --> 02:41.955
You are in the phase
of your relationship

02:42.057 --> 02:44.423
where you find
each other's quirks adorable.

02:44.526 --> 02:46.826
But that all changes when
you start working together.

02:46.928 --> 02:47.894
How?

02:47.996 --> 02:49.362
Because you grow sick of each other

02:49.464 --> 02:53.033
and then those adorable quirks,
they turn into unbearable flaws.

02:53.135 --> 02:56.235
And then? The hatred sets in.

02:56.337 --> 02:58.672
Well, here's the thing.
We don't have any flaws

02:58.774 --> 03:02.175
so it's a non-stop
lovey-dovey phase for us.

03:02.277 --> 03:03.276
Well, that's impossible.

03:03.371 --> 03:04.737
Nobody can stay in that phase forever.

03:04.846 --> 03:07.047
Watch us.

03:07.094 --> 03:08.614
Oh, no! Oh, no!

03:08.684 --> 03:10.050
Enough with the thumb kissing.

03:10.118 --> 03:12.786
Do you two actually believe
that you are perfect

03:12.854 --> 03:14.709
and will never grow sick of each other?

03:14.748 --> 03:15.669
- Yes.
- Yes.

03:15.694 --> 03:18.758
Then I must say,
with immense reservations...

03:18.819 --> 03:20.293
you have the job, I guess.

03:20.328 --> 03:21.760
- You got the job!
- I did it!

03:21.862 --> 03:23.028
Ah, I'm so proud!

03:23.097 --> 03:24.763
<i>Glascott's soft side had caved to Coach.</i>

03:24.832 --> 03:26.199
<i>As for Wilma, everyone knew</i>

03:26.267 --> 03:27.866
<i>she was the school's biggest hard-ass.</i>

03:27.935 --> 03:30.703
Becky and Harriet, I hear you
gossiping back there!

03:30.771 --> 03:32.004
- Sorry, ma'am.
- Yeah, sorry, ma'am.

03:32.073 --> 03:34.773
Now you two separate. But do it quietly.

03:34.842 --> 03:36.676
<i>And it didn't just stop
in the classroom.</i>

03:36.744 --> 03:39.044
<i>She was just as tough
in her student advisory.</i>

03:39.113 --> 03:41.914
Ronnie, we gotta talk
about your joke of a schedule.

03:41.982 --> 03:43.683
If you just pick the easiest classes,

03:43.751 --> 03:45.819
it limits where you can go
after high school.

03:45.889 --> 03:48.087
It's all good. I already know
exactly where I want to go.

03:48.147 --> 03:49.054
Really? Where?

03:49.123 --> 03:50.489
To the top of the charts.

03:50.558 --> 03:51.857
I'm gonna be in a boy band.

03:51.959 --> 03:53.526
Are you for real? Is this for real?
I can't tell.

03:53.595 --> 03:56.095
I know, at first I thought
boy bands were lame, too.

03:56.163 --> 03:58.431
But after some serious soul searching,

03:58.499 --> 04:00.199
I realized my ultimate goal in life

04:00.268 --> 04:02.834
is to be rich and famous
so I can land hot chicks.

04:02.902 --> 04:04.001
Make sense?

04:04.065 --> 04:06.068
No. Your dream is garbage.

04:06.145 --> 04:07.377
- What?
- Get out.

04:07.451 --> 04:09.474
Hey, Wilma.

04:09.576 --> 04:11.476
Can I talk to you for a few-skis?

04:11.545 --> 04:13.911
So, um, listen,
Glascott wanted me to check in

04:13.980 --> 04:16.214
to see how the faculty advising
is going.

04:16.283 --> 04:17.449
- Why?
- Oh, you know,

04:17.517 --> 04:20.051
just because...
there are some complaints,

04:20.153 --> 04:21.853
kids wanting to ditch you as advisor

04:21.921 --> 04:24.155
and come to me, Lainey,
or Johnny Atkins.

04:24.224 --> 04:25.323
He's the janitor!

04:25.392 --> 04:26.725
Who's also nice and encouraging,

04:26.793 --> 04:28.593
as opposed to you,
who's mean and scares children.

04:28.695 --> 04:29.494
Excuse me?!

04:29.596 --> 04:30.895
See, there it is.

04:30.964 --> 04:32.029
So scary.

04:32.098 --> 04:34.165
Look, Wilma,
your tough style works in class,

04:34.234 --> 04:36.033
but one-on-one, you just gotta listen,

04:36.136 --> 04:37.502
understand, and advise.

04:37.604 --> 04:38.770
Which I did.

04:38.872 --> 04:40.505
I listened to his dream.

04:40.607 --> 04:42.206
I understood it was dumb.

04:42.309 --> 04:43.907
And I advised him to get the hell out.

04:43.976 --> 04:45.108
What I mean, though, is the kids,

04:45.177 --> 04:46.644
they don't want you
to advise them anymore

04:46.712 --> 04:48.845
because you can sometimes be a meanie.

04:48.914 --> 04:50.881
They think I'm mean?
Oh, I'll show them mean.

04:50.949 --> 04:52.416
No. They don't want you to be mean.

04:52.485 --> 04:53.950
What they want is for you
to be supportive.

04:54.019 --> 04:56.119
They want supportive?
I'll show them supportive.

04:56.188 --> 04:58.855
That is the request, and yet
you sound very vindictive.

04:58.924 --> 05:00.491
No, I get it. They want supportive.

05:00.593 --> 05:02.559
I'm gonna support the crap out of them.

05:02.628 --> 05:03.494
Okay.

05:04.430 --> 05:05.796
Again, the words are right,

05:05.864 --> 05:07.665
but the delivery is really spiteful.

05:07.733 --> 05:08.699
Guess what, Ronnie?

05:08.768 --> 05:10.534
Wilma's gonna
make your dreams come true.

05:10.603 --> 05:12.202
- Huh?
- You're gonna be in a boy band!

05:12.237 --> 05:14.037
No, you're right. It's a stupid dream.

05:14.106 --> 05:16.340
I'll just work at my dad's
super lucrative accounting firm.

05:16.409 --> 05:19.075
No! You will not go down
a sensible career path!

05:19.144 --> 05:20.877
I'm gonna help you achieve
your stupid dream

05:20.946 --> 05:22.045
whether you like it or not.

05:22.114 --> 05:23.480
- But I-I...
- No buts!

05:23.582 --> 05:24.548
Dreams coming true!

05:24.617 --> 05:25.949
Now go spread the word

05:26.051 --> 05:28.651
that supportive Wilma
is open for business.

05:28.720 --> 05:29.953
Yo, CB!

05:30.022 --> 05:31.955
My new boy band needs
a random, awkward, older dude

05:32.024 --> 05:33.790
who just seems excited to be there.

05:33.859 --> 05:35.625
I beg you not to involve me
in this, Ronnie.

05:35.694 --> 05:37.828
Classic CB, not supporting our dreams.

05:37.896 --> 05:40.596
You can learn a thing or two
from this lady here.

05:40.665 --> 05:42.299
I regret helping you.

05:42.334 --> 05:44.801
<i>And so began the new era
of supportive Wilma.</i>

05:44.870 --> 05:46.002
<i>As for Coach and Julie,</i>

05:46.071 --> 05:47.637
<i>they were starting
their new job together.</i>

05:47.739 --> 05:48.771
<i>And Glascott was wrong.</i>

05:48.841 --> 05:50.506
<i>A few quirks wouldn't change a thing.</i>

05:50.575 --> 05:52.775
Oh, Sorry! I'm a bad parker.

05:52.878 --> 05:54.577
Well, looks like I found
your only quirk.

05:54.646 --> 05:56.479
And whattya know,
I like you more than ever.

05:56.581 --> 05:57.513
Aw, really?

05:57.615 --> 05:59.049
The way you park is perfect.

05:59.117 --> 06:00.150
Just like you.

06:00.219 --> 06:01.718
<i>But then the quirks got weirder.</i>

06:01.786 --> 06:03.286
Ah, cod, my man.

06:03.388 --> 06:06.188
Gimme those Omega-3s!
Imbue me with your fish power!

06:06.257 --> 06:09.091
Is it me, or do you talk
to your food before every bite?

06:09.160 --> 06:10.893
Looks like you found my only quirk.

06:10.962 --> 06:12.394
I can stop if you want me to.

06:12.496 --> 06:14.596
Do not stop, it's perfect.

06:14.665 --> 06:15.797
Just like you.

06:15.900 --> 06:17.532
<i>Then the quirks got annoying.</i>

06:17.601 --> 06:19.268
Everyone says that Geno's and Pat's

06:19.370 --> 06:20.602
makes the best cheesesteak,

06:20.671 --> 06:23.805
but supposably it's this place
Donkey's in Camden.

06:23.875 --> 06:25.640
I discovered that place in the '80s.

06:25.743 --> 06:27.576
- Also, it's "supposedly."
- What's that?

06:27.644 --> 06:29.111
You said "supposably,"

06:29.213 --> 06:30.880
but it's actually "supposedly."

06:30.948 --> 06:32.514
Another one of your little quirks there.

06:32.583 --> 06:34.420
Oh. Sorry.

06:34.506 --> 06:35.717
Don't be!

06:35.819 --> 06:37.987
The way you mispronounce
a shocking amount of words

06:38.055 --> 06:39.288
is perfect, like you.

06:39.390 --> 06:41.692
- You are perfect.
- Mm.

06:43.361 --> 06:44.626
<i>By the end of the week,</i>

06:44.695 --> 06:46.695
<i>those cute little quirks
were flat-out unbearable.</i>

06:46.764 --> 06:49.197
Come on. It's like
you're doing it on purpose.

06:49.266 --> 06:50.765
You said my one quirk was cute.

06:50.867 --> 06:53.768
Well, that's when I thought you
only had one, not... 87.

06:53.870 --> 06:56.371
Oh! And you're one to talk. Literally.

06:56.472 --> 06:58.139
To your trout before every bite.

06:58.208 --> 06:59.774
It's cod, and you know that.

06:59.842 --> 07:02.143
Oh, God. Are we fighting over fish?

07:02.212 --> 07:03.878
No, of course not. We don't fight.

07:03.980 --> 07:04.946
But we are.

07:05.048 --> 07:06.614
Maybe Glascott was right.

07:06.682 --> 07:08.082
Come on, it's us!

07:08.151 --> 07:10.885
We're perfect, and we will never
grow sick of each other.

07:13.656 --> 07:15.823
Ah, my lean bison.

07:15.892 --> 07:18.459
You're just packed with iron and zinc

07:18.528 --> 07:20.295
and the strength of Tatonka.

07:20.363 --> 07:23.097
Come, let us be one.

07:23.166 --> 07:26.034
<i>Turns out working together
is bad for happy lovebirds.</i>

07:26.102 --> 07:29.102
<i>As for Wilma, she was tired of
always being the mean teacher.</i>

07:29.171 --> 07:30.504
Hey-oh!

07:30.573 --> 07:32.339
Guess who just got discovered in a mall.

07:32.442 --> 07:33.774
You did.

07:33.843 --> 07:36.510
Hi, I'm John Calabasas,
and today is your lucky break.

07:36.579 --> 07:38.211
Not for you, 'cause I got pepper spray.

07:38.314 --> 07:39.513
And I've grown immune.

07:39.615 --> 07:40.648
But no worries.

07:40.750 --> 07:42.550
There's plenty of other
fresh faces in this mall

07:42.652 --> 07:45.419
that would love
to be in a... music video.

07:45.521 --> 07:48.589
<i>Ah yes, it was
the classic '90s video kiosk.</i>

07:48.691 --> 07:51.224
<i>Back then, every mall,
Bar Mitzvah, and cheesy wedding</i>

07:51.327 --> 07:52.593
<i>had one, and it was epic.</i>

07:52.695 --> 07:53.828
Look at the sign.

07:53.930 --> 07:56.730
We're certified by
Kapital Records in Hollywood...

07:56.833 --> 07:58.599
Florida, no relation
to the Capitol Records

07:58.701 --> 07:59.733
in Hollywood, Los Angeles.

07:59.836 --> 08:01.101
And it's only 99 bucks!

08:01.203 --> 08:02.770
99 bucks? Isn't that kinda high?

08:02.872 --> 08:05.372
For state-of-the-art
green-screen technology

08:05.475 --> 08:07.441
and video-wipe effects

08:07.542 --> 08:10.710
as used by George Lucas in "Star Wars"?

08:10.812 --> 08:11.978
Boom!

08:12.080 --> 08:14.380
Look, you're in outer space.

08:16.217 --> 08:17.650
Star wipe, boom!

08:17.752 --> 08:18.918
Now you're in a lava lamp.

08:19.020 --> 08:20.653
Up-n-down wipe, boom.

08:20.755 --> 08:23.122
Now there's six of you,
and you're walking on water.

08:23.224 --> 08:25.024
Can you make any kind of video,

08:25.126 --> 08:27.226
like one for a dummy
who wants to be in a boy band?

08:27.328 --> 08:30.129
Of course. The music video
is the perfect calling card.

08:30.231 --> 08:33.099
In fact, one of the biggest
boy bands of our generation

08:33.201 --> 08:35.034
got their start in this very mall.

08:35.135 --> 08:38.304
Ever heard of
the Backstreet Boys, AKA BSB?

08:38.405 --> 08:39.571
Wow, yes!

08:39.673 --> 08:42.375
Well, then, you for sure
maybe heard of CPK.

08:42.477 --> 08:43.509
California Pizza Kitchen?

08:43.611 --> 08:44.877
Cool Posse Kids.

08:44.979 --> 08:46.045
From Doylestown.

08:46.147 --> 08:47.079
Drr!

08:47.181 --> 08:48.414
So whattya say? We got a deal?

08:48.516 --> 08:50.682
I'm on a mission to prove
that I'm not scary and mean.

08:50.784 --> 08:52.518
- So deal!
- All right.

08:52.620 --> 08:54.453
I'm gonna make a boy band!

08:55.575 --> 08:58.010
<i>Julie's new job had put
a strain on things with Coach,</i>

08:58.078 --> 09:00.098
<i>but neither wanted to admit
Glascott was right.</i>

09:00.161 --> 09:03.669
Hey, there's William Penn's
own Florence Nightingale.

09:03.747 --> 09:05.290
Thanks a lot for the flu shot, Julie.

09:05.352 --> 09:07.727
Oh, thank you for giving me this job.

09:07.806 --> 09:10.641
Well, I gotta admit, I was wrong
about you working with Rick.

09:10.709 --> 09:12.313
Seems like it's going great, huh?

09:12.347 --> 09:13.546
Couldn't be better. Mmm!

09:13.607 --> 09:15.206
So lean, so protein-y.

09:15.259 --> 09:17.781
Can you please
just eat the bison already?

09:17.850 --> 09:19.983
No one here wants to hear
your pre-ample.

09:21.253 --> 09:23.420
And yet everyone here wants to tell you

09:23.488 --> 09:25.856
that the word is actually preamble.

09:25.903 --> 09:27.194
Please, tell her.

09:27.225 --> 09:28.139
- Pass.
- I'd rather not.

09:28.163 --> 09:30.031
- I feel uncomfortable.
- What's happening right now?

09:30.100 --> 09:31.299
Nothing. We're perfect.

09:31.368 --> 09:32.835
We haven't even had our first fight.

09:32.903 --> 09:34.837
Not even when Rick refused his flu shot

09:34.905 --> 09:36.538
'cause he's being a baby.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.206
Not fighting, just a fact.

09:38.275 --> 09:40.208
And I told you in a non-fighting way

09:40.277 --> 09:41.909
that I don't need a flu shot

09:41.979 --> 09:43.945
because my bones produce
super-antibodies

09:44.014 --> 09:46.681
- which defeat all forms of illness.
- Hmm.

09:46.749 --> 09:48.616
And I'm not fighting when I say this,

09:48.685 --> 09:50.651
but we all know
that when Rick is scared,

09:50.720 --> 09:53.688
he says crazy things that go
against science and reason.

09:53.756 --> 09:56.057
I think I speak for everyone
when I say uh-oh.

09:56.126 --> 09:58.526
Not fighting, but maybe
you could tell the lady

09:58.628 --> 10:01.363
to stop busting my balls,
since it's bad enough

10:01.431 --> 10:03.031
her mother, Carol, does it, right?!

10:03.133 --> 10:04.765
- Tell her!
- Not fighting,

10:04.834 --> 10:08.347
but tell him that everyone
in school hates his shorts!

10:08.432 --> 10:09.797
Whoa!

10:09.866 --> 10:12.233
No one's fighting, even though
I hate her ex-boyfriend Josh.

10:12.302 --> 10:15.070
And I told you we're just friends.

10:15.138 --> 10:17.338
Well, find another friend
to play tennis with!

10:17.441 --> 10:18.638
It's not okay!

10:18.740 --> 10:20.407
Tell her, it's just not okay!

10:20.509 --> 10:22.642
No one answer. Everyone just go.

10:22.744 --> 10:24.545
I'm sorry.

10:24.646 --> 10:25.979
We'll work on it

10:26.082 --> 10:28.014
so we don't put the faculty
in the middle.

10:28.084 --> 10:31.685
Agreed. Both to this and to
the fact that Josh sucks.

10:31.787 --> 10:34.254
My office, now.

10:34.323 --> 10:35.691
- Boom!
- Gah!

10:35.753 --> 10:37.433
No need to be scared, I come in peace.

10:37.495 --> 10:39.926
Ronnie, your faculty advisor
has found a way

10:39.995 --> 10:42.496
for your boy band to make a music video.

10:42.565 --> 10:44.231
Dude! You wanna be in a boy band?

10:44.300 --> 10:46.366
No. I don't even know
what she's talking about.

10:46.435 --> 10:47.834
I'm talking about your dream!

10:47.903 --> 10:50.571
Even if I super wanted to be
in a mega awesome boy band,

10:50.672 --> 10:52.772
which I don't, 'cause they suck,

10:52.841 --> 10:54.640
I don't even have any other members.

10:54.742 --> 10:56.642
You are so lame, dude.

10:56.711 --> 10:59.178
But also I want to be
a part of your musical dream

10:59.247 --> 11:00.646
more than anything.

11:00.715 --> 11:03.382
I am looking for someone who can
be the shy, sensitive one.

11:03.451 --> 11:05.518
Who, me?

11:05.620 --> 11:07.153
Shy enough?

11:07.222 --> 11:08.854
Looks like you found your first member.

11:08.923 --> 11:10.356
Now you're in his boy band?

11:10.458 --> 11:12.725
My God, you guys are such losers!

11:12.793 --> 11:15.128
Which is something the bad boy
of the group would say.

11:15.196 --> 11:16.829
- You're in.
- Awesome.

11:16.897 --> 11:18.998
You're the best faculty advisor
ever, Mrs. H.

11:19.066 --> 11:21.501
I don't know why everyone says
you're mean and terrifying.

11:21.569 --> 11:23.136
I accept your implied apology.

11:23.204 --> 11:24.903
Come on, let's go write a hit song

11:24.972 --> 11:26.506
and buy matching oversize overalls.

11:26.574 --> 11:28.941
See? It's all coming together.

11:30.202 --> 11:31.143
And cut!

11:31.245 --> 11:33.411
Guys, that's the one.

11:33.480 --> 11:35.374
Unless you want to pay $99 to go again,

11:35.444 --> 11:36.448
then that would be the one.

11:36.517 --> 11:38.283
No, we crushed it!

11:38.352 --> 11:39.984
Wilma! Wilma, I'm here!

11:40.086 --> 11:41.186
Got your 911 page.

11:41.255 --> 11:42.654
What's the emergency? Everything okay?

11:42.722 --> 11:43.821
Get suited up.

11:43.890 --> 11:46.124
Their music video needs
an awkward, random, old guy.

11:46.193 --> 11:48.059
No! I'm not in your boy band.

11:48.128 --> 11:49.661
We all know you're in the boy band.

11:49.763 --> 11:50.886
This is my fault.

11:50.952 --> 11:52.683
I shouldn't have told you
what the kids think about you.

11:52.769 --> 11:53.931
Oh, like I didn't know.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.301
No matter where I teach,
I'm always mean Mrs. H.

11:56.347 --> 11:57.369
I thought you didn't care.

11:57.464 --> 11:58.470
Of course I care!

11:58.539 --> 12:00.305
It's hurtful and makes me sad

12:00.407 --> 12:02.274
but also angry, like I'll show them all.

12:02.342 --> 12:03.618
- And this is the way?
- Yes.

12:03.696 --> 12:05.176
Maybe when everyone goes crazy

12:05.244 --> 12:07.844
over this fun, little
music video I made happen,

12:07.913 --> 12:09.213
those kids will realize

12:09.282 --> 12:13.517
that I'm not the scary
dream crusher they think I am.

12:13.586 --> 12:15.568
In a weird way... that makes sense.

12:15.669 --> 12:16.987
So you'll join the boy band?

12:17.089 --> 12:18.589
No.

12:18.658 --> 12:21.124
God, you gotta stop, Wilma.

12:21.194 --> 12:22.693
I'll work on him.

12:22.795 --> 12:24.861
Well, well, well.

12:24.930 --> 12:26.497
If only someone here would've predicted

12:26.599 --> 12:29.433
that working together would
implode your relationship.

12:29.502 --> 12:31.235
I know. None of us saw it coming.

12:31.337 --> 12:32.570
What?! I did!

12:32.638 --> 12:34.738
I literally mapped out
exactly what would happen!

12:34.807 --> 12:35.972
We gave it a shot.

12:36.075 --> 12:38.107
Clearly, it's best if I just resign.

12:38.176 --> 12:40.510
So you can hold it over my head
for the rest of your life?

12:40.579 --> 12:41.578
No way!

12:41.646 --> 12:42.712
I resign.

12:42.814 --> 12:44.347
You're gonna resign
just to prove a point?

12:44.449 --> 12:45.582
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

12:45.650 --> 12:48.017
Then I un-resign
and I'm staying indefinitely.

12:48.086 --> 12:51.120
Nobody resigns until I say they resign!

12:51.223 --> 12:52.422
Fine, then I quit.

12:52.524 --> 12:53.423
You can't quit.

12:53.525 --> 12:54.890
You're a pillar at this school

12:54.959 --> 12:56.959
and more important than a nurse
that's been here for a week.

12:57.061 --> 12:58.094
Does that mean I've been fired?

12:58.196 --> 12:59.762
Don't you dare fire her.
I won't allow it.

12:59.864 --> 13:01.197
Again, it's not your call.

13:01.299 --> 13:02.665
John, if you really are
my friend, damn it,

13:02.767 --> 13:03.899
you'll fire me right now!

13:03.968 --> 13:06.068
Will you just fire him
so we can be done with this?

13:06.170 --> 13:07.570
Oh, wait, you want me to be fired?

13:07.639 --> 13:09.272
John, I want my job back

13:09.341 --> 13:11.040
so I can stay here forever with her!

13:11.109 --> 13:12.874
End of discussion!

13:12.976 --> 13:14.209
- Fine!
- Fine!

13:15.178 --> 13:17.279
Okay, who's quitting and who's staying?

13:17.348 --> 13:18.647
I lost track.

13:18.716 --> 13:20.649
<i>While Julie and Mellor left
on a sour note,</i>

13:20.718 --> 13:22.317
<i>Wilma was ready to show everyone</i>

13:22.419 --> 13:23.719
<i>her sweet, supportive side.</i>

13:23.754 --> 13:26.121
Before we finish today's lab,
I have a question.

13:26.223 --> 13:28.457
Show of hands, how many of you think

13:28.525 --> 13:30.759
that I am mean and/or scary?

13:33.530 --> 13:36.632
Shows what you guys know.
Mrs. H is the dreammaker.

13:36.700 --> 13:38.333
Yeah, and she's the one
who strong-armed us

13:38.435 --> 13:39.834
into forming Street II Men.

13:39.936 --> 13:41.136
What the crap is Street II Men?

13:41.238 --> 13:43.004
Watch and learn, students.

That's right, mean ol' Mrs. H

14:48.804 --> 14:50.762
is fully responsible for this video.

14:52.106 --> 14:54.129
Hey, why are you all laughing?

14:54.176 --> 14:56.943
It's like they took the worst
parts of every boy band song

14:57.011 --> 14:58.083
and mashed them together.

14:58.169 --> 15:00.613
Why were you wearing ski pants
on a spaceship?

15:00.716 --> 15:02.782
'Cause our love's icy hot
and outta this world.

15:02.884 --> 15:04.050
How's that not clear?

15:04.152 --> 15:06.653
Okay, but why were you all
hanging around in T-shirts

15:06.755 --> 15:07.887
on one bed?

15:07.989 --> 15:09.361
Why were we on that bed?

15:11.493 --> 15:14.894
Oh, my God, this song is awful
and my dreams are shallow.

15:14.996 --> 15:18.598
Your faculty advisor/dreammaker
will fix this!

15:18.700 --> 15:19.666
Don't.

15:19.768 --> 15:21.334
You've done enough already.

15:21.436 --> 15:22.836
I guess you were right.

15:22.937 --> 15:25.572
My big, angry attempt
to show them nice Wilma

15:25.674 --> 15:26.906
only made it worse.

15:27.008 --> 15:29.541
Look, I know you're hurt
by how the kids see you...

15:29.643 --> 15:31.643
To be clear...

15:31.746 --> 15:33.145
I'm very hurt.

15:33.248 --> 15:35.014
But I'll always be me, so it's best

15:35.116 --> 15:36.548
if I just get used to it.

15:39.811 --> 15:43.270
<i>In just one week, Julie's stint
as school nurse was done.</i>

15:43.333 --> 15:45.586
Well, I guess that's it.

15:45.649 --> 15:47.916
Thanks again for giving me
this opportunity.

15:47.970 --> 15:51.638
- Not so fast.
- Oh, God, he's back to fight more.

15:51.708 --> 15:53.307
I'm here to fix this.

15:53.375 --> 15:55.810
You see, I realized there is
a way to make this work.

15:55.870 --> 15:57.845
I'm gonna get rid of all my quirks.

15:57.914 --> 16:00.181
Julie wants me to wear pants...

16:00.249 --> 16:01.816
then I'll wear pants.

16:01.884 --> 16:02.883
For love.

16:02.952 --> 16:04.018
I don't know what's happening,

16:04.087 --> 16:05.264
but I'm certain that's not a thing.

16:06.488 --> 16:07.588
This is unsettling.

16:07.656 --> 16:09.122
I'm just new to the process.

16:09.191 --> 16:11.390
Well, you're doing it wrong, man!
Do it right!

16:11.459 --> 16:12.558
- If I stand my...
- What is this?

16:12.627 --> 16:13.860
Just bend your knees
like a normal human person.

16:13.962 --> 16:16.196
- My legs will adjust.
- It's hard to watch.

16:16.297 --> 16:18.164
Just walk normal, please!

16:18.233 --> 16:20.033
Stop yelling at me, I'm doing my best!

16:20.102 --> 16:22.168
I didn't ask you to change!
Not like this!

16:22.270 --> 16:24.604
See? Mellor wears shorts,
Wilma is scary.

16:24.672 --> 16:25.705
We are who we are!

16:25.774 --> 16:26.940
It doesn't mean you can give up.

16:27.008 --> 16:28.110
There's a way to be Wilma

16:28.157 --> 16:30.188
- and support these kids in your own way.
- Ah, man.

16:30.235 --> 16:32.078
Ah, somebody please help me!

16:32.147 --> 16:34.214
Maybe you're right,
maybe all that matters

16:34.315 --> 16:35.715
is I'm there for the kids...

16:35.784 --> 16:37.350
even if they find it mean and scary.

16:37.418 --> 16:38.885
Well, just do one leg at a time!

16:38.954 --> 16:40.153
You're jamming it up down there!

16:40.222 --> 16:42.188
Rick, if you take a seat,
you can do the left foot...

16:45.626 --> 16:47.059
All right, Street II Men.

16:47.128 --> 16:48.627
Enough pouting, time to fix this.

16:48.695 --> 16:51.263
Fix it? You made us a laughing
stock to the whole school!

16:51.331 --> 16:52.464
I did do that, yes.

16:52.532 --> 16:54.032
I was just trying to be supportive.

16:54.101 --> 16:56.735
Sure, maybe it seems
it's tough and scary,

16:56.804 --> 16:58.036
but that's just me.

16:58.105 --> 16:59.805
And unlike all your other teachers,

16:59.874 --> 17:01.206
when you got Wilma on your side,

17:01.275 --> 17:04.608
you got the cold, hard truth
and red-hot results.

17:04.678 --> 17:07.246
Only result was school-wide mockery.

17:07.314 --> 17:09.481
So your first music video
was a disaster.

17:09.549 --> 17:12.885
Still showed that you guys got
killer moves and voices.

17:12.953 --> 17:15.453
So get off your asses and go
show everyone what you got.

17:15.521 --> 17:16.588
Street II Men has broken up.

17:16.656 --> 17:18.556
For now. But as we all know,

17:18.625 --> 17:22.026
every great boy band stages
an epic comeback reunion tour.

17:22.127 --> 17:23.127
Says who?

17:23.229 --> 17:24.663
Says the awkward, old guy in the group.

17:24.731 --> 17:25.896
You're not even in the band.

17:25.964 --> 17:27.231
We all know I'm in the band.

17:27.300 --> 17:28.266
Forget it, dude.

17:28.335 --> 17:30.435
That song got us
laughed out of the room.

17:30.504 --> 17:33.772
Then I say our boy band does
a song that no one can resist.

Julie, wait.

18:54.551 --> 18:56.017
Don't quit this job.

18:56.119 --> 18:57.853
This school could use a nurse like you.

18:57.954 --> 18:59.654
What about us?

18:59.757 --> 19:01.623
We went from not having one fight

19:01.725 --> 19:03.124
to having every one possible.

19:03.226 --> 19:04.225
Exactly!

19:04.327 --> 19:06.127

19:06.229 --> 19:07.929
or that you obsess over the dishwasher

19:08.031 --> 19:10.098
or that you hate ketchup
but love tomatoes?

19:10.200 --> 19:11.833
Yes, it's insane.

19:11.935 --> 19:14.168
The point is,
if those are your worst flaws,

19:14.271 --> 19:15.837
then I'll take them.

19:15.939 --> 19:17.071
I'll take all of it

19:17.140 --> 19:19.608

19:19.710 --> 19:21.443

19:45.535 --> 19:47.501
Could really use some help

19:47.603 --> 19:50.070
You know, trying to figure out
where to go after high school.

19:50.139 --> 19:51.405
I thought it was top of the charts.

19:51.474 --> 19:54.542
Well, actually,
after your scary pep talk,

19:54.610 --> 19:57.144

19:57.246 --> 20:00.213
