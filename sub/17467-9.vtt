09:39.927 --> 09:42.103
"these people are quitters.

09:42.146 --> 09:44.018
"You're not a quitter,

09:44.061 --> 09:45.802
"you're the opposite
of that,

09:45.846 --> 09:48.457
you're a successful
film director."

09:49.719 --> 09:50.938
Move it.

09:50.981 --> 09:52.461
Mm.
Not that way.

09:52.504 --> 09:54.637
[coughs]
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:54.681 --> 09:56.073
Bad! Bad hand!

09:56.117 --> 09:57.771
We-We-We talked about that.

09:57.814 --> 09:59.337
Thank God I brought
my good hand.

09:59.381 --> 10:00.600
[chuckles]

10:00.643 --> 10:01.818
Okay.

10:01.862 --> 10:03.472
You're Adam's friend,

10:03.515 --> 10:05.953
and you're really drunk right
now, so I'm gonna be a sport

10:05.996 --> 10:07.432
and give both your hands a pass.

10:07.476 --> 10:08.695
But if it ever happens again,

10:08.738 --> 10:10.087
I will hit you so hard,

10:10.131 --> 10:12.046
you'll be crapping teeth
for a week.

10:15.484 --> 10:18.661
God help me, it
might be worth it.

10:23.492 --> 10:25.102
And three double cheeseburgers.

10:25.146 --> 10:26.234
With cheese.

10:26.277 --> 10:28.410
Two large fries...

10:28.453 --> 10:31.195
With cheese
and a chicken sandwich.

10:31.239 --> 10:32.457
...and a chicken sandwich.

10:32.501 --> 10:33.458
And a burrito.

10:33.502 --> 10:34.503
They don't have burritos.

10:34.546 --> 10:35.635
Why don't they have burritos?

10:35.678 --> 10:37.854
Why don't you have burritos?!

10:37.898 --> 10:39.334
I think that's it.

10:39.377 --> 10:41.641
Oh! Oh, and a crunchy
candy cookie cup.

10:41.684 --> 10:42.859
I-I think we've got enough.

10:42.903 --> 10:46.428
Cookie cup, cookie cup,
cookie cup!

10:46.471 --> 10:48.560
CLERK:
So... three cookie cups?

10:48.604 --> 10:51.172
Sure.
Yes.

10:51.215 --> 10:52.434
It'll be $52.75.

10:52.477 --> 10:54.392
Please drive forward.

10:54.436 --> 10:56.786
So... whoa...
[laughs]

10:56.830 --> 10:58.570
[clears throat]
So...

10:58.614 --> 11:00.703
you and... you and Adam
are cute together.

11:00.747 --> 11:02.270
Thank you.

11:02.313 --> 11:03.750
Is he still good in bed?

11:05.360 --> 11:07.057
I'm sorry, what?

11:07.101 --> 11:09.712
He was incredible
back when he had legs.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.061
Oh, I'm... Oh, I'm sorry.

11:11.105 --> 11:12.715
I don't want...
I didn't mean that.

11:12.759 --> 11:15.849
I mean, of course he still
has legs, but, you know...

11:15.892 --> 11:18.808
You slept with Adam?

11:20.767 --> 11:23.552
Dear Lord,
will this night ever end?

11:23.595 --> 11:25.467
Answer me.
Calm down.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.774
It was a long time ago
before I met Mitch,

11:27.817 --> 11:33.475
and we only did it, like,
t... t... 20 times.

11:33.518 --> 11:35.738
Really thought
you were gonna say two.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.522
So, you were a couple?

11:37.566 --> 11:38.959
No, oh, no!

11:39.002 --> 11:41.875
No, no, it was just that
kind of raw kind of sex.

11:41.918 --> 11:43.485
You know, the kind
you think about

11:43.528 --> 11:46.444
when you're on the toilet
having a cigarette.

11:46.488 --> 11:49.317
Hey, guys, this is important.
Guys, this is important, listen.

11:49.360 --> 11:53.713
Mitch doesn't know, so we just
have to keep it between us.

11:53.756 --> 11:57.499
You know... sisterhood
of the traveling penis.

11:57.542 --> 11:59.414
[laughs]

12:02.678 --> 12:04.549
I don't know what you're
always whining about.

12:04.593 --> 12:06.900
This thing is awesome.

12:06.943 --> 12:09.250
Food's here.

12:09.293 --> 12:10.338
Oh, finally.

12:10.381 --> 12:11.774
Hey, baby, did you know

12:11.818 --> 12:13.123
that the liquor store
down on the corner,

12:13.167 --> 12:14.429
that it delivers?

12:14.472 --> 12:16.126
Just eat your burger, Dickweed.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.086
Huddle.

12:19.129 --> 12:20.174
Ugh, I don't want
to huddle.

12:20.217 --> 12:21.610
Just let me go to sleep.

12:21.653 --> 12:23.046
What? You think you're
too pretty to huddle now?

12:23.090 --> 12:24.352
Get in there.

12:24.395 --> 12:27.137
I am pretty, aren't I?

12:27.181 --> 12:29.705
Why didn't you
get me any vodka?

12:29.749 --> 12:32.186
Why didn't you get me
a 24-year-old Asian girl

12:32.229 --> 12:34.014
with big boobs?

12:34.057 --> 12:35.929
Hey, words hurt.

12:35.972 --> 12:37.931
Just kidding.

12:37.974 --> 12:39.976
Ah, I love you.

12:40.020 --> 12:42.022
And you have perfect boobs.

12:42.065 --> 12:43.980
You, too.

12:47.679 --> 12:49.464
That right there.

12:49.507 --> 12:51.379
That's how you make
a marriage work.

12:53.076 --> 12:55.687
Thanks, buddy.

12:58.473 --> 12:59.604
Where are we?

13:02.694 --> 13:05.262
I'm sorry, I just can't
wrap my head around it.

13:05.306 --> 13:06.481
20 times?

13:06.524 --> 13:07.874
She's probably exaggerating.

13:07.917 --> 13:09.179
When it comes to sex,

13:09.223 --> 13:10.833
women round down,
Christy, not up.

13:10.877 --> 13:12.226
We do?You don't?

13:12.269 --> 13:14.054
I didn't, but I will now.

13:15.185 --> 13:16.883
I'm not sure how to handle it.

13:16.926 --> 13:18.841
There's nothing to handle.
It's in the past.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.234
No, it's in my living room,

13:20.277 --> 13:22.018
and more important,
he didn't tell me.

13:22.062 --> 13:24.194
So, what, you're
gonna confront him?

13:24.238 --> 13:25.761
I thought the whole idea
of this evening

13:25.805 --> 13:27.197
was to make his friends
like you.

13:27.241 --> 13:29.634
That's when I was putting
deviled eggs on levels.

13:29.678 --> 13:31.636
I should've just
put out a dog bowl.

13:33.595 --> 13:37.642
Okay, Adam, it's time
you and I have a talk.

13:39.122 --> 13:41.081
Oh, lovely.

13:44.519 --> 13:46.564
Under the head,
under the head.

13:48.392 --> 13:50.917
Where's Lord and
Lady Nutsack?

13:50.960 --> 13:54.877
Probably playing kickball
with their livers.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.792
MITCH: Come on, baby,
let's make a dirty movie.

13:56.836 --> 14:00.361
LEANNE: Okay, okay, turn around
and try to relax.

14:03.755 --> 14:06.584
Thin walls. I get it now.

14:06.628 --> 14:08.848
We're gonna have
to burn that bed.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.719
[thump]

14:10.762 --> 14:12.068
What just happened?

14:12.112 --> 14:13.678
I don't know.
That sounded bad.

14:13.722 --> 14:16.768
I guess we should go see
if they're okay.

14:16.812 --> 14:20.860
Or we just leave and rebuild
our lives elsewhere.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.256
[knocking at door]

14:26.300 --> 14:28.215
Hello?

14:34.699 --> 14:37.180
Well, this is just sad.

14:40.096 --> 14:42.490
Remember being too
drunk to have sex?
[sighs]

14:42.533 --> 14:45.797
It's the main reason
you're an only child.

14:45.841 --> 14:47.016
So, what do we do?

14:47.060 --> 14:48.278
[sighs]

14:48.322 --> 14:51.151
Roll them on their sides
and be grateful

14:51.194 --> 14:52.674
we don't live
like this anymore.

14:52.717 --> 14:55.024
So very grateful.

14:55.068 --> 14:56.983
[slow farting]

14:59.986 --> 15:03.859
Oh, God,
was that him or her?

Mitch, where'd you go?

Come on,
it was an honest mistake.

When you grabbed my
ass in the kitchen,

16:25.810 --> 16:27.029
was that an
honest mistake?

16:27.073 --> 16:28.422
Well, a person can make

16:28.465 --> 16:30.641
more than one honest mistake.

You grabbed her ass?

to get in bed with my daughter.

16:41.913 --> 16:44.046
What? No, no,
that can't be right.

It may have been 18 months
and 11 days,

16:46.266 --> 16:48.224
but I know when a man
is in bed with me.

16:49.791 --> 16:51.401
This is all your fault.

16:51.445 --> 16:52.402
My fault?!

16:52.446 --> 16:53.447
You invited these

16:53.490 --> 16:54.883
zoo animals into my home,

16:54.926 --> 16:56.232
and you never told me

16:56.276 --> 16:58.147
you slept with this monkey.

something you should tell me?

we got together.

Yeah, it was just joking around.

my bad hand bit.

my best friend's girl...

19:17.243 --> 19:18.635
...or her daughter...

in their laundry hamper.

This damn disease. Am I right?

to this program

that it's not my fault.
