22:11.230 --> 22:12.530
<i>Dad, he's already gone.</i>

22:12.730 --> 22:14.460
Then I'm going after him.

22:14.660 --> 22:15.930
Dad, please.

22:16.130 --> 22:18.030
- I wanna talk about my brother.
- Harlan is--

22:18.230 --> 22:19.900
No! I meant the other one.

22:20.100 --> 22:22.000
- We can talk about him
when Harlan is here.

22:22.200 --> 22:23.310
We don't have time.

22:23.500 --> 22:25.110
Baron's killing
people every night.

22:25.310 --> 22:26.510
He hides the bodies somewhere.

22:26.710 --> 22:28.140
That's why there's still
so many people missing.

22:28.340 --> 22:30.750
- That's why you're not
going anywhere tonight.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.780
- What if we could
change him back?

22:32.980 --> 22:34.580
No.

22:34.780 --> 22:36.020
- You knew how to bring
Harlan back

22:36.220 --> 22:37.620
with the myth
about saying his name.

22:37.820 --> 22:39.390
- You wanna
hear another myth?

22:39.590 --> 22:41.160
When a woman
has seven daughters

22:41.360 --> 22:44.290
and the eighth child is
a man, he'll be a werewolf.

22:44.490 --> 22:45.760
I wouldn't count on
all of the myths.

22:45.960 --> 22:48.200
- Then how did you
know it would work?

22:48.400 --> 22:50.330
- I guessed.
- You guessed right.

22:50.530 --> 22:52.730
From something I read online.

22:52.930 --> 22:54.900
My next guess could
get someone killed.

22:55.100 --> 22:56.570
- So what do the myths
say about

22:56.770 --> 22:58.040
changing someone
back to human?

22:58.240 --> 23:00.280
You mean like a cure?

23:00.470 --> 23:01.710
Is there one?

23:01.910 --> 23:03.210
Yeah.

23:03.410 --> 23:05.110
The one that cures all humans--

23:05.310 --> 23:06.310
death.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.580
Where are you going?

23:09.680 --> 23:11.290
To find your brother.

23:11.490 --> 23:12.750
Harlan.

23:20.130 --> 23:23.000
<i>[somber music]</i>

23:35.710 --> 23:37.450

23:37.650 --> 23:39.280
Why bring Phoebe here?

23:39.480 --> 23:40.580
I don't know.

23:40.780 --> 23:42.550
But I'm gonna find Harlan,

23:42.750 --> 23:44.590
and we're gonna
figure out what to do.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.190
'Kay.

23:52.630 --> 23:54.200
Danny, ease up.

23:54.390 --> 23:55.700
You're hurting my hand.

23:57.160 --> 24:00.200
We know her.
You remember her, right?

24:00.400 --> 24:01.700
I remember.

24:01.900 --> 24:03.370
Yeah, from the parking lot.

24:03.570 --> 24:06.210
- No.
From the parking garage.

24:06.410 --> 24:08.080
No, the lot.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.080
Right outside the motel,
over there,

24:10.280 --> 24:11.050
when I was running.

24:11.250 --> 24:12.180
Remember?

24:13.550 --> 24:14.850
Okay, fine.

24:15.050 --> 24:17.990
Parking garage--
whatever you wanna call it.

24:18.190 --> 24:20.250
Don't stare.

24:29.300 --> 24:31.570
- You know we're gonna need
to talk about this, right?

24:31.770 --> 24:35.140
- How about this time
with a lawyer?

24:36.340 --> 24:39.070
- She's not being
accused of a crime.

24:39.270 --> 24:41.340
Although the fact that you and
Phoebe were such close friends

24:41.540 --> 24:43.680
does raise a lot of questions.

24:43.880 --> 24:45.480
So we'll bring a lawyer.

24:45.680 --> 24:46.920
Of course.

24:47.110 --> 24:49.120
Will you be needing
a court-appointed lawyer,

24:49.320 --> 24:50.920
or will you be paying
for one yourself?

24:51.120 --> 24:52.620
Oh, look at that, Blake.

24:52.820 --> 24:54.320
She's just like you.

24:54.520 --> 24:55.920
Goes right for the throat.

25:00.460 --> 25:01.900
I'll talk.

25:03.330 --> 25:06.000
As long as you promise nothing
happens to my brother...

25:07.200 --> 25:09.240
I'll tell you whatever
you want to hear.

25:09.440 --> 25:10.870
I believe you.

25:11.070 --> 25:13.170
You're not gonna believe me.

25:13.370 --> 25:15.840
- I think I might surprise you
on that subject.

25:17.410 --> 25:19.510
Both of you.

25:20.110 --> 25:22.480
- So in order to turn
Baron back to human,

25:22.680 --> 25:24.290
we have to kill him?

25:24.480 --> 25:26.860
- The myth is it's a biological
protective measure.

25:27.050 --> 25:29.260
It keeps their
true nature secret.

25:30.420 --> 25:32.190
- So you wanna
kill the werewolf...

25:32.390 --> 25:34.300
- Yeah.
- Wait for it to turn human...

25:34.490 --> 25:35.430
- Uh-huh.

25:35.630 --> 25:37.130
Then bring it back to life?

25:37.330 --> 25:39.330
- But we're not really bringing
the werewolf back to life.

25:39.530 --> 25:41.800
Once the heart stops
and it changes to human,

25:42.000 --> 25:44.040
we're actually bringing
the human back.

25:44.810 --> 25:46.840
How?

25:47.040 --> 25:49.210
- CPR, epinephrine,
and a defibrillator.

25:49.410 --> 25:51.750
The thing is,
he has to be cold.

25:51.950 --> 25:53.310
At super low temperatures,

25:53.510 --> 25:55.550
the brain doesn't need
as much oxygen.

25:55.750 --> 25:57.650
So when you freeze,
your heart stops,

25:57.850 --> 26:00.050
but your brain keeps working.

26:00.250 --> 26:01.760
You could be technically
dead for three hours

26:01.960 --> 26:03.630
and still be brought back.

26:03.820 --> 26:05.560
Technically dead?

26:05.760 --> 26:07.230
The heart, but not the brain.

26:07.430 --> 26:08.800
Think about it.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.030
What if all we have to do
is stop Baron's heart?

26:11.230 --> 26:13.330
What if that's dead enough?

26:14.140 --> 26:15.570
- Dead enough
to change him to human,

26:15.770 --> 26:18.540
but not so dead where he
can't be brought back to life?

26:18.740 --> 26:20.810
Right.

26:24.110 --> 26:27.280
Harlan, we're gonna
get him out.

26:27.480 --> 26:28.450
Baron?

26:28.650 --> 26:30.550
- No.
Cyrus.

26:30.750 --> 26:32.390
We all know he didn't do it.

26:32.590 --> 26:34.390
And we're gonna do
something about it,

26:34.590 --> 26:36.020
but we need to do this first.

26:36.220 --> 26:38.630
Well, actually,
first we need to figure out

26:38.830 --> 26:40.230
how to freeze the thing.

26:40.430 --> 26:42.230
The werewolf.

26:42.430 --> 26:44.470
Yeah.

26:46.130 --> 26:48.240
How about the freezer?

26:48.440 --> 26:49.470
What freezer?

26:49.670 --> 26:51.270
- Garrett told us
that Ramsey brought him

26:51.470 --> 26:53.740
to an overflow morgue,
and they had a medical freezer.

26:53.940 --> 26:56.040
It can go to 70 below.

26:57.880 --> 26:59.680
- Well,
then all we have to do

26:59.880 --> 27:01.720
is get Baron inside,
lock the door,

27:01.920 --> 27:03.750
and wait for him to freeze.

27:03.950 --> 27:06.150
- But how are we gonna
get him inside?

27:07.960 --> 27:09.960
- You wanna use
Austin as bait?

27:10.160 --> 27:11.960
- Baron's
gonna kill him anyway.

27:12.160 --> 27:13.560
Look outside, Luna.

27:13.760 --> 27:16.230
We don't have a lot of time
before the sun goes down.

27:16.430 --> 27:19.030
- Where are you even gonna
get a shot of epinephrine?

27:29.540 --> 27:30.610
[electricity buzzes]

27:30.810 --> 27:32.010
Thanks for coming with me.

27:32.210 --> 27:33.680
I know we've been through
this place more than once.

27:33.880 --> 27:35.850
- I was headed out
to find Harlan.

27:36.780 --> 27:37.990
He's not answering my calls.

27:38.190 --> 27:40.420
- He probably won't be
talking to me, either.

27:40.620 --> 27:42.090
[liquid dripping]

27:42.290 --> 27:45.690
- So are we here about arson
or a dead teenage girl?

27:45.890 --> 27:47.930
Starting to think both.

27:48.130 --> 27:50.600
- Because of where
the body was found?

27:51.430 --> 27:53.500
- As a park ranger,
do you know any animals

27:53.700 --> 27:55.100
smart enough to maul someone

27:55.300 --> 27:58.210
and then dump the body
in a bathtub at a motel

27:58.410 --> 28:00.640
where their former best friend
happens to be staying?

28:00.840 --> 28:02.140
As a park ranger,

28:02.340 --> 28:05.750
I'd say that's pretty unusual
behavior for an animal.

28:05.950 --> 28:07.820
- Well,
as an arson investigator,

28:08.020 --> 28:10.350
I am not a homicide detective.

28:10.550 --> 28:12.520
I'm gonna stick
with what I know.

28:13.490 --> 28:14.790
The fire originated here.

28:14.990 --> 28:16.990
So if we missed something,

28:17.190 --> 28:19.490
this is most likely
where we're gonna find it.

28:26.230 --> 28:28.340
Does Everett know?

28:29.940 --> 28:31.310
Yeah.

28:31.510 --> 28:32.670
So he lied.

28:32.870 --> 28:34.010
I don't think he wanted to.

28:34.210 --> 28:35.580
- Fuck him.
I'll do it.

28:35.780 --> 28:37.310
The whole thing?

28:37.510 --> 28:39.880
- You just said
it's gonna kill me anyways.

28:42.350 --> 28:43.820
I'll do it.

28:44.020 --> 28:45.590
That's it?

28:45.790 --> 28:48.160
You don't...you don't wanna
ask any questions about--

28:48.360 --> 28:49.420
No.

28:52.490 --> 28:54.030
Actually, yeah.

28:58.270 --> 29:01.540
I know you've had
a crush on me.

29:03.840 --> 29:06.670
But do you actually like me?

29:06.870 --> 29:08.840
- I meant questions about--

29:09.040 --> 29:10.540
This is my question.

29:10.740 --> 29:12.350
Do you like me?

29:15.320 --> 29:16.450
Yes.

29:17.480 --> 29:18.690
Yes, I like you.

29:18.890 --> 29:20.590
No, you don't.

29:23.320 --> 29:25.060
I like you sometimes.

29:25.260 --> 29:26.800
- When I'm not
a complete asshole.

29:26.990 --> 29:28.300
Which is only sometimes.

29:28.500 --> 29:31.300
Probably a little
less than that.

29:34.200 --> 29:37.400
- You like me a little
less than sometimes?

29:39.940 --> 29:41.380
Yes.

29:45.880 --> 29:48.120
I'm good with that.

29:51.190 --> 29:54.090
What's the plan?

30:39.900 --> 30:41.170
Use it only if you have to.

30:41.370 --> 30:44.010
If everything goes to shit.

30:49.880 --> 30:52.150
Dude, can I get one of those?

30:55.150 --> 30:57.890
Three vials of epinephrine.

30:58.420 --> 31:00.920
- How come you never
asked about the fire

31:01.120 --> 31:02.760
that killed my son?

31:04.490 --> 31:08.060
- I didn't ask 'cause I didn't
want to cross any boundaries.

31:08.260 --> 31:11.330
I'll cross them.

31:11.530 --> 31:14.240
He died with his father

31:14.430 --> 31:16.870
who was trying to protect him.

31:17.070 --> 31:18.470
I'm sorry.

31:18.670 --> 31:21.310
- His father
was not a perfect man.

31:21.510 --> 31:25.110
To be honest, seeing you
with Harlan and Luna

31:25.310 --> 31:26.980
makes me realize
that my son could have

31:27.180 --> 31:28.520
used a father like you.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.920
- You did notice my kids
aren't speaking to me.

31:32.120 --> 31:34.260
- That just means
you're a good parent.

31:34.450 --> 31:37.190
They should get angry
with us sometimes.

31:37.390 --> 31:39.830
And we're allowed
to get angry, too.

37:16.030 --> 37:18.330
Could I borrow that?

37:18.530 --> 37:21.600
- As long as you
promise to give it back.

37:42.920 --> 37:45.160
There's something down there.

37:45.360 --> 37:47.360
What's that sound?

37:47.560 --> 37:50.000
[buzzing]

37:54.500 --> 37:56.600
Flies.

38:01.010 --> 38:03.810
<i>[intense music]</i>

38:07.210 --> 38:09.180
They're coming.

38:09.380 --> 38:10.720
You ready?

38:10.920 --> 38:13.620
I'm not doing Lion's Breath.

38:13.820 --> 38:15.260
I wasn't gonna ask.

38:15.460 --> 38:17.060
Good.

38:20.190 --> 38:21.600
[loud exhale]

38:26.200 --> 38:27.970
It works, okay?

38:29.200 --> 38:31.710
Give me a fucking break.

38:33.770 --> 38:36.910
<i>[romantic music]</i>

38:52.530 --> 38:55.700
[phone buzzing]

38:56.530 --> 38:58.630
They're here.

39:06.140 --> 39:07.880
Okay, this is good.

39:08.070 --> 39:11.950
I feel incredibly vulnerable
and completely exposed.

39:12.150 --> 39:13.410
Perfect.

39:13.610 --> 39:15.080
We'll see it coming.

39:15.280 --> 39:16.980
- How far do you think it
could track me by scent?

39:17.180 --> 39:18.650
- An ordinary wolf
can smell its prey

39:18.850 --> 39:20.250
a mile and a half away.

39:20.450 --> 39:22.860
Prey?

39:24.320 --> 39:25.630
Like me.

39:28.330 --> 39:29.800
I'm sorry.

39:32.570 --> 39:35.300
I saw it take Phoebe.

39:37.240 --> 39:39.040
I didn't see it kill her,

39:39.240 --> 39:43.880
but it was dragging
her body over the sunroom.

39:45.650 --> 39:47.780
And I didn't tell anyone,

39:47.980 --> 39:49.950
because no one
would believe me.

39:52.390 --> 39:55.160
We believe you.

39:58.790 --> 40:00.630
And by the way...

40:02.830 --> 40:05.070
I don't think
you're an asshole.

40:05.260 --> 40:07.670
- I can be a total
fucking asshole.

40:07.870 --> 40:10.770
- But it's not your
default setting.

40:10.970 --> 40:13.410
- So all I had to do
to get you like me

40:13.610 --> 40:15.810
was be the bait
for a werewolf

40:16.010 --> 40:18.610
that's probably gonna kill me.

40:21.350 --> 40:24.350
Can't believe I didn't
think of that first.

40:43.840 --> 40:45.770
[flies buzzing]

40:48.680 --> 40:50.980
There's 18 of them.

40:55.720 --> 40:57.220
You're calling it in?

40:57.420 --> 40:58.950
I have to.

40:59.150 --> 41:00.290
When?

41:00.490 --> 41:01.820
What do you mean, when?

41:02.020 --> 41:04.390
- Do you have to
call it in now?

41:04.590 --> 41:07.600
You know how this works.

41:07.790 --> 41:09.830
- If you call this in,
everything changes.

41:11.730 --> 41:15.100
Homicide takes over.
The feds come in.

41:15.300 --> 41:17.070
- I get pushed aside
and become an advisor

41:17.270 --> 41:20.340
to a much larger investigation
that I no longer control.

41:20.540 --> 41:21.840
I know how it works.

41:22.040 --> 41:24.310
Don't call it in.

41:24.510 --> 41:25.610
I'm an officer of the law.

41:25.810 --> 41:28.680
So am I.

41:28.880 --> 41:30.950
What are you not telling me?

41:31.150 --> 41:35.620
- My kids can't get caught
up in something this big.

41:35.820 --> 41:37.490
Why?

41:37.690 --> 41:41.090
- There are things that
would come out about them,

41:41.290 --> 41:44.200
things no one knows,
and no one has to know.

41:44.400 --> 41:46.600
What if they did?

41:46.800 --> 41:49.200
I'd lose them.

41:49.400 --> 41:52.070
I can't lose my kids.

41:53.440 --> 41:54.710
Tell me.

41:54.910 --> 41:56.280
Trust me.

41:56.480 --> 41:58.510
Please.

41:58.710 --> 42:02.680
I'll help you find the
person who actually did this.

42:02.880 --> 42:05.020
I can help you.

42:06.720 --> 42:08.960
Was it a person?

42:09.160 --> 42:10.420
Yes.

42:12.730 --> 42:14.060
- But somehow,
you're superstitious

42:14.260 --> 42:16.860
enough to load your gun
with silver bullets,

42:17.060 --> 42:18.230
not nickel-plated.

42:18.430 --> 42:21.770
So let me ask this
one more time.

42:21.970 --> 42:24.270
Was it a person that did this?

42:24.470 --> 42:25.740
Yes.

42:28.580 --> 42:31.010
And no.

43:00.170 --> 43:03.240
It's here.

43:03.440 --> 43:05.750
- What?
How do you know that?

43:08.510 --> 43:10.780
Oh, fuck me.

43:10.980 --> 43:13.890
[snarling]

43:16.360 --> 43:19.060
- What's it doing?
- I don't know.

43:22.200 --> 43:23.760
So what do we do?

43:28.170 --> 43:31.300
It's because of me.

43:31.500 --> 43:32.870
What?

43:33.070 --> 43:35.580
- It's not coming after
you because of me.

43:35.780 --> 43:37.980
It has to see you as a threat.

43:38.180 --> 43:39.880
Okay. What do I do?

43:40.080 --> 43:41.620
Threaten you?

43:41.820 --> 43:43.720
Hit me.

43:43.920 --> 43:46.490
- What?
- I need you to hit me.

43:46.690 --> 43:48.490
I can't do that.

43:50.120 --> 43:51.390
If you don't do it now,

43:51.590 --> 43:53.290
it comes back and it
kills you some other night.

43:53.490 --> 43:55.160
Austin, please.

43:55.360 --> 43:56.360
Hit me.

43:56.560 --> 43:58.630
I can't do it.

44:01.800 --> 44:02.770
- You don't think
I can take it?

44:02.970 --> 44:04.040
Come on.
Hit me back, asshole.

44:04.240 --> 44:05.370
I can't.

44:07.970 --> 44:09.880
[snarling]

44:21.220 --> 44:24.190
Did that make things worse?

44:24.390 --> 44:25.960

So can I.

- Anyone!

49:34.670 --> 49:37.840
- Wait, I-I need the shot.

49:38.040 --> 49:39.770
The epi shot.
Where is it?

49:39.970 --> 49:43.340
- It's supposed to be in the bag.
- I got it.

- Let him die.
- But he's part of the pack.

50:36.130 --> 50:37.360
There is no pack, Harlan.

you need to tell me.

when someone's lying.

if I'm lying?
