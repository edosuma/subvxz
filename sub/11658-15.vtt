What the hell is that?

01:01.000 --> 01:03.900
It's a wedding cake for little Joanie
Winston up the street.

01:04.567 --> 01:07.934
-You know, Sam and Edna's daughter.
-That's a girl? Woof!

01:10.467 --> 01:13.500
-Dorothy, what are you doing up?
-Her banging woke me.

01:13.567 --> 01:15.967
-What are you talking about?
-The toilet seat, ma.

01:16.500 --> 01:19.734
Four women live in this house.
The toilet seat never has to move.

01:19.800 --> 01:21.900
You always manage to make it bang.

01:23.967 --> 01:25.100
Forgive me, sweetheart.

01:25.166 --> 01:28.633
Why don't you just get me a litter box
to keep next to my nightstand?

01:31.133 --> 01:33.200
Rose, is that a wedding cake
you're making?

01:33.266 --> 01:35.367
Yeah, it's my wedding present
to little Joanie Winston.

01:35.433 --> 01:38.433
Oh, Joanie Winston's getting married.
How lovely.

01:39.500 --> 01:42.133
I wonder how she'll fix
the hair on her ears.

01:44.700 --> 01:46.100
Well, the wildest part of the evening

01:46.166 --> 01:48.934
was when the Latin busboy dropped his
crumb brush in my lap.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.633
-Oh. Not the man of your dreams, huh?
-On a scale of 1 to 10, a 7.

01:52.700 --> 01:55.500
-Well, that's not bad.
-Actually, he was more like a 5,

01:55.567 --> 01:57.166
but he just looked
so good with me on his arm,

01:57.233 --> 01:58.767
I gave him another 2 points.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.200
Well, that cake looks delicious.
Let's cut her up.

02:03.800 --> 02:06.133
Well, I was going to give it
to Joanie Winston,

02:06.200 --> 02:07.767
but if you're really that hungry,

02:07.834 --> 02:10.033
I'd still have time to make another one
for the wedding.

02:10.533 --> 02:14.734
Of course, I have to address
those 3,000 envelopes in the morning

02:14.800 --> 02:17.567
after I pick up the decorations
for the hootenanny at the church.

02:18.133 --> 02:21.266
But that'll still give me plenty of time
to wash cars in the afternoon...

02:21.900 --> 02:23.500
and give blood before 7:00.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.200
Rose, this is insane.

02:26.266 --> 02:28.400
Honey, you have to learn how to say no.

02:28.467 --> 02:31.800
Hey, why don't you just sit down here with
us and relax for a while?

02:31.867 --> 02:33.433
What do you say we have our usual?

02:33.500 --> 02:35.800
Great idea.
I'll get the bowls and the spoons.

02:35.867 --> 02:36.934
I'll get the ice cream.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.767
I'll get the chocolate sauce
and whipped cream. Oh, wait a minute.

02:39.834 --> 02:44.100
Uh, did anybody see a piece of paper
with directions on it?

02:44.166 --> 02:46.467
Oh, honey, we've made these sundaes
hundreds of times.

02:46.533 --> 02:47.767
We don't need directions.

02:48.934 --> 02:50.433
No, I mean directions for the wedding.

02:50.500 --> 02:53.000
I promised to get the cake there by 8:00.

02:53.533 --> 02:56.467
Do you believe her?
She doesn't stop for a minute.

02:56.533 --> 02:59.066
I don't agree with it, but I do understand
the thinking behind it.

02:59.133 --> 03:00.734
My granddaddy was the same way.

03:00.800 --> 03:03.600
He always said, "idle hands are the
devil's workshop."

03:04.066 --> 03:07.734
'Course, he also said sitting on cold
concrete will cause hemorrhoids.

03:10.066 --> 03:11.834
So we just sort of learned
when to ignore him.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.533
(crash)

03:17.333 --> 03:18.633
oh, my God!

03:18.700 --> 03:22.367
-Rose. Rose! What happened, honey?
-Call an ambulance.

03:22.433 --> 03:24.166
-Oh, my goodness.
-Rose...

03:24.233 --> 03:28.000
Oh, here. Take it easy. Take it easy.
Just breathe.

03:34.934 --> 03:38.867
Dorothy, I'm scared.
I've never seen Rose look so terrible.

03:38.934 --> 03:40.700
I know. I'm worried, too.

03:40.767 --> 03:43.433
Would you two knock it off? I'm telling
you, there's nothing to worry about.

03:43.500 --> 03:44.900
Ma, how do you know that?

03:44.967 --> 03:46.767
When you reach my age,
you get pretty good

03:46.834 --> 03:49.233
at spotting the 12 warning signs
of death.

03:52.033 --> 03:54.066
-What are they?
-Number one...

03:54.467 --> 03:56.700
your children start visiting
during the week.

03:58.600 --> 04:01.633
Number two, your doctor won't let you
postdate a check.

04:03.333 --> 04:06.467
Number three, you can't eat cream of wheat
because it's too spicy.

04:07.767 --> 04:09.734
Will you stop?
Will you stop?

04:10.633 --> 04:13.500
-I mean, this could be serious.
-Of course, it could.

04:13.767 --> 04:15.834
That's why I'm trying
not to think about it.

04:16.133 --> 04:18.133
I'll be honest.
If anything happened to Rose,

04:18.200 --> 04:20.200
it would be like losing one of
my own children.

04:22.500 --> 04:23.834
I'm going to the cafeteria.

04:23.900 --> 04:27.467
My canasta club gives this hospital's
jell-o three stars.

04:32.467 --> 04:34.800
Excuse me. Are you the ladies who came in
with Mrs. Nylund?

04:34.867 --> 04:36.967
-Yes. Yes, we are.
-I'm Dr. Wallerstein.

04:37.033 --> 04:38.367
I've been treating her
since she arrived.

04:38.433 --> 04:41.300
Oh, Dorothy, she's going to be all right.
Her doctor's a Jew.

04:49.567 --> 04:51.233
Blanche, please.

04:52.033 --> 04:53.633
How is she, Dr. Jew? Uh...

04:56.033 --> 04:58.667
-Wallerstein.
-Why don't you come see for yourselves?

05:01.633 --> 05:05.734
-Rose, honey, how are you feeling?
-Oh, you gave us quite a scare.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.734
Doctor, is she gonna be all right?

05:07.800 --> 05:10.500
She'll be fine.
It was just an esophageal spasm.

05:10.567 --> 05:13.700
-A what?
-A constriction of the food pipe.

05:14.033 --> 05:15.600
It can be painful and frightening,

05:15.667 --> 05:17.567
-but it's not at all serious.
-Oh, thank God.

05:17.633 --> 05:19.300
She just needs to take it easy
for a few days,

05:19.367 --> 05:20.834
and she'll be as good as new.

05:20.900 --> 05:23.166
Rose, I want you to relax here
for a few more minutes,

05:23.233 --> 05:24.767
then your friends can take you home.

05:24.834 --> 05:26.433
-Oh, good.
-Thank you, doctor.

05:26.500 --> 05:27.567
Yes, thank you.

05:28.867 --> 05:29.967
Is he gone?

05:30.333 --> 05:31.934
Yeah. Is something wrong?
You want him back?

05:32.000 --> 05:34.233
No, no. I just wanna
make sure he was gone.

05:34.300 --> 05:35.834
I have to tell you what happened.

05:36.500 --> 05:39.734
I died. I died and went to heaven.

05:46.600 --> 05:50.600
Rose, honey, you didn't die.
You passed out. You hallucinated.

05:50.667 --> 05:53.567
Remember that new year's eve
when you had three margaritas?

05:53.633 --> 05:57.266
Hmm? You thought you were
an animated broom in <i>Fantasia.</i>

05:58.767 --> 06:00.233
Look, I know it sounds crazy.

06:00.300 --> 06:03.300
That's why I wouldn't tell anybody
but my two closest friends.

06:03.367 --> 06:07.367
But it's true. It really is.
I died and went to heaven.

06:07.900 --> 06:10.233
Well, it wasn't actually
heaven proper.

06:10.300 --> 06:12.000
It was somewhere on the outskirts.

06:13.600 --> 06:15.734
You died and went to a suburb of heaven?

06:17.200 --> 06:21.066
No. No, it was
an enormous train station...

06:21.433 --> 06:23.467
like Grand Central, only cleaner...

06:24.166 --> 06:26.934
and without hare Krishna's
asking for money.

06:27.834 --> 06:31.166
There were people everywhere
rushing off to catch trains,

06:31.233 --> 06:33.967
sitting on benches,
browsing in the souvenir shop.

06:34.033 --> 06:35.433
The souvenir shop?

06:35.500 --> 06:38.166
Well, of course, Blanche
they were all buying t-shirts.

06:38.233 --> 06:39.333
You know, the ones that say,

06:39.400 --> 06:42.166
"today is the first day
of the end of your life."

06:46.600 --> 06:50.266
At the information desk was
this huge train schedule,

06:50.333 --> 06:54.500
and next to every departure
it said, destination, heaven.

06:55.133 --> 06:58.934
My first thought was,
gee, what a great title for a movie.

06:59.834 --> 07:02.567
My second thought was,
damn, I'm dead.

07:04.700 --> 07:08.300
Well, I was so stunned,
I just started wandering aimlessly

07:08.367 --> 07:09.533
through this train station,

07:09.600 --> 07:15.633
when I heard a familiar voice calling,
"Wose, wose, is that weally you?"

07:17.767 --> 07:19.967
It was my uncle Johansen.

07:20.300 --> 07:22.567
He died when I was 9 years old.

07:23.100 --> 07:25.233
A steam shovel hit him in the mouth.

07:29.400 --> 07:33.834
-I was so happy to see a familiar face.
-Well, at least from the nose up.

07:34.967 --> 07:35.967
Right.

07:36.633 --> 07:39.967
Anyway, uncle Johansen
asked to see my ticket...

07:40.533 --> 07:44.400
and he said, "Wose, wose,
this is a wound twip ticket.

07:46.100 --> 07:49.467
You can go back
and continue to live your life,

07:49.533 --> 07:53.200
but before you go,
I have two pieces of advice...

07:53.900 --> 07:57.266
don't get hit in the mouth with a steam
shovel. That can kill you.

07:58.233 --> 08:01.100
And make the most
of the time you're given.

08:01.533 --> 08:04.700
You'd be surpwised
how quickly it goes."

08:05.700 --> 08:08.533
Listen, Rose, honey, it's been a very
tough night for all of us.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.800
So why don't we go home
and west

08:10.867 --> 08:12.867
and we'll talk about your twip
in the morning.

08:13.367 --> 08:15.834
But, Dorothy, don't you realize
what happened?

08:16.200 --> 08:19.467
I died and came back.
I was given a second chance,

08:19.533 --> 08:21.967
a chance to do all the things
I've never done,

08:22.033 --> 08:24.934
a chance to live my life
for myself for a change,

08:25.000 --> 08:30.133
oh, you're looking at a new Rose Nylund.
The girl who's going to eat life.

08:32.233 --> 08:37.633
-Hi, cookie. How you feeling?
-Oh, fine, Sophia, but I did die.

08:38.133 --> 08:41.667
-I died and went to heaven.
-That's nice.

08:43.033 --> 08:45.834
Find out what pills they gave her
and ask for a doggie bag.

08:52.066 --> 08:54.900
-(phone ringing)
-I'm coming,

08:54.967 --> 08:58.600
-(phone ringing)
-I'm coming. I'm coming.

09:01.100 --> 09:02.600
Hello?

09:02.667 --> 09:06.133
No, Rose is not here.
Do you have any idea what time it is?

09:06.667 --> 09:09.600
It is not party time, it is sleepy time.

09:10.667 --> 09:12.667
No, that is not an invitation.

09:16.133 --> 09:18.300
Sir, you cannot die from that.

09:18.667 --> 09:20.400
No, it's just uncomfortable.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.600
Take a cold shower,
and the normal color will return.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.166
Bye-bye.

09:28.667 --> 09:32.266
-Now, who in hell was that?
-Another one of Rose's new friends.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.600
Friends? They're more like animals.

09:34.667 --> 09:37.800
All they do is party and carry on
all hours of the night.

09:37.867 --> 09:39.200
I am abhorred.

09:39.266 --> 09:42.400
We know what you are, Blanche.
I'm glad to finally hear you admit it.

09:47.967 --> 09:49.633
Sophia, I said, "abhorred."

09:49.700 --> 09:52.600
Abhor, a slut, a tramp. It's all the same.

09:56.300 --> 10:00.567
-Ma, we're talking about Rose.
-Yeah, lately she's been abhor, too.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.734
Frankly, I am worried about her.

10:03.800 --> 10:07.533
You know, this new lifestyle is probably
harder on her than it is on us.

10:07.600 --> 10:09.800
What do you mean, harder on her?

10:09.867 --> 10:12.467
We're the ones who have to
carry all the responsibility around here

10:12.533 --> 10:16.367
-while she's out there "eating life."
-I ate life once.

10:17.433 --> 10:18.633
Not a bad cereal.

10:21.133 --> 10:23.600
When we run out of shredded wheat,
let's give it a try again.

10:23.667 --> 10:24.900
Ma, go to bed.

10:24.967 --> 10:26.967
Maybe I'll have
some shredded wheat now.

10:27.033 --> 10:28.900
That way, we'll get to the life sooner.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.533
-I'm really worried about her.
-Oh, Sophia's always like that

10:34.600 --> 10:36.200
when you wake her up
in the middle of the night.

10:36.266 --> 10:38.133
No, not ma. Rose!

10:38.600 --> 10:42.166
Ever since she took that death trip,
she's been a different person.

10:42.233 --> 10:43.500
Well, that's no excuse.

10:43.567 --> 10:47.033
Shirley MacLaine died five or six times,
and she's just sweet as pie.

10:49.567 --> 10:51.433
Oh, hi, girls.
I'm glad you're still up.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.867
We're on our way to the beach
for a sunrise breakfast.

10:53.934 --> 10:57.100
-Why don't you get dressed and join us?
-No, thank you, Rose.

10:57.166 --> 10:58.567
Well, ok. Suit yourself.

10:58.633 --> 11:00.233
I'll grab a few blankets
and be on my way.

11:00.300 --> 11:03.333
Rose, Rose.
Come on. Sit down. We have to talk.

11:03.400 --> 11:06.100
I can't, Dorothy.
I've got six people waiting in the van,

11:06.166 --> 11:07.800
and they're kind of
a rowdy bunch.

11:07.867 --> 11:09.533
Rose, don't you think you're overdoing
this?

11:09.600 --> 11:11.934
-Overdoing what?
-Oh, come on, Rose.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.967
It's ok to want to get more out of life,
but you're pushing yourself too hard.

11:17.033 --> 11:18.166
I can handle it.

11:18.233 --> 11:21.200
No, you can't. And neither can we.
You're driving us crazy.

11:21.266 --> 11:25.066
-Hey, I'm just trying to live my life.
-Yes, but you're ruining ours.

11:25.133 --> 11:27.333
You get phone calls
at all hours of the night.

11:27.400 --> 11:29.333
You have people running
in and out of this house.

11:29.400 --> 11:32.133
And you don't do a thing
to help out around here anymore.

11:32.200 --> 11:34.000
Oh, so that's what this is about.

11:34.066 --> 11:35.900
You're just upset because
I'm not the old Rose

11:35.967 --> 11:37.734
sitting around,
doing things for everybody else.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.867
-Now, that's not true.
-Yes, it is.

11:39.934 --> 11:42.834
Oh, Rose, honey,
we're only thinking of you.

11:42.900 --> 11:45.233
Well, I'm only thinking of me, too.

11:45.667 --> 11:48.300
If you two can't adjust to my new
lifestyle,

11:48.367 --> 11:49.834
well, maybe we have a problem here.

11:49.900 --> 11:53.066
No, Rose.
You're the one who has a problem.

11:53.133 --> 11:56.066
Are you telling me I can't my life
the way I want?

11:56.133 --> 11:58.934
Not if it means disrupting
everybody else's life, Rose.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.066
-You're getting impossible to live with.
-Is that so?

12:02.133 --> 12:04.166
Well, then I guess there's
just one thing to do.

12:04.433 --> 12:06.166
I guess I'll have to move out.

12:07.934 --> 12:09.000
(slams door)

12:20.033 --> 12:22.567
Hey, I got a letter
from Gina Marie Donatelli.

12:22.934 --> 12:26.400
Her cousin Joe is hanging the wallpaper
in Tony Bennett's guest bathroom.

12:26.467 --> 12:28.533
Oh, that's nice.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.834
He says celebrities
stop by there all the time.

12:30.900 --> 12:33.967
In one day, he saw
Dean Martin, Liberace...

12:34.333 --> 12:36.000
Don Rickles, and Mitzi Gaynor.

12:36.066 --> 12:39.567
All of these people stopped by
to use the bathroom on the same day?

12:40.734 --> 12:42.767
What am I, urologist to the stars?

12:44.333 --> 12:46.000
I'm just telling you what she told me.

12:46.066 --> 12:50.133
Sorry, ma. I wasn't paying attention.
I keep thinking about Rose.

12:50.200 --> 12:51.200
Oh, just forget about her.

12:51.266 --> 12:53.734
If she doesn't wanna be our roommate,
that is fine with me.

12:53.800 --> 12:56.000
In fact, I'm happy she's leaving.
Ha ha ha.

12:56.467 --> 12:59.533
You see how happy I am, Dorothy?
You try it. Go, "ha ha ha."

13:00.233 --> 13:02.633
If you don't mind, Blanche
I'll laugh on the inside.

13:04.066 --> 13:06.633
Well, the car's all packed,
and I'm ready to go.

13:06.700 --> 13:10.300
Rose, before you go,
I just want to give you a little advice.

13:11.233 --> 13:13.900
Sometimes in life,
you start out down one path.

13:14.266 --> 13:16.033
Suddenly, the wind changes direction.

13:16.333 --> 13:20.367
And you find yourself swimming upstream
looking for new horizons.

13:21.767 --> 13:23.734
Ma, what the hell does that mean?

13:25.300 --> 13:26.300
Don't get smart with me.

13:26.367 --> 13:29.500
If I was a short, bald guy in a diaper
spouting this gibberish,

13:29.567 --> 13:30.867
I'd be running India.

13:32.033 --> 13:33.600
Goodbye, Rose.

13:35.300 --> 13:38.367
-Well, I guess this is it.
-Yep. Guess so.

13:38.433 --> 13:42.800
Isn't it funny how things turn out?
Being dead really changed my life.

13:43.333 --> 13:45.233
It does that for a lot of people, Rose.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.867
I know you don't understand,
and I know you don't approve,

13:48.934 --> 13:51.667
but I'm going what I have to do,
and I feel good about it.

13:52.367 --> 13:55.467
Well, thanks for everything.
It's been great.

13:58.734 --> 13:59.900
Rose.

14:01.533 --> 14:05.934
-I'll see that all your mail is forwarded.
-Thanks. I'd appreciate that.

14:06.767 --> 14:08.100
Oh, Rose.

14:09.433 --> 14:11.967
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

14:28.934 --> 14:31.266
-Hi, Stephanie.
-Hi, Rhonda.

14:31.700 --> 14:33.834
-It's Rose.
-Sorry.

14:33.900 --> 14:35.734
Oh, that's quite all right.

14:35.800 --> 14:39.233
There's a little poem my mom made up
that might help you remember. It goes--

14:39.300 --> 14:42.233
Hey, your name is Rose.
I think I can handle that.

14:42.300 --> 14:43.500
Okey-dokey.

14:44.567 --> 14:47.033
Hey! Why don't we take
a nice walk on the beach?

14:47.100 --> 14:49.967
-It's right outside the door.
-I hate the beach.

14:50.533 --> 14:52.867
-Well, then why do you live here?
-It's near work.

14:54.133 --> 14:55.333
Do you have a valium?

14:55.400 --> 14:59.233
No. Oh, but I do have
a tangerine lifesaver.

14:59.300 --> 15:01.200
That always helps chase
the blues away for me.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.934
No, thanks. I don't like the hard stuff.

15:05.266 --> 15:06.400
Hi, Steph.

15:06.467 --> 15:09.266
-Stephanie.
-God, am I beat.

15:09.333 --> 15:11.333
That London trip is a killer.

15:11.400 --> 15:14.433
I've got to be in Paris in 12 hours.
I'm gonna get some rest.

15:14.500 --> 15:18.300
-Hi, Liz. We haven't met, but I'm--
-Stephanie's mother.

15:18.367 --> 15:19.967
I'd recognize you anywhere.

15:20.033 --> 15:23.500
-No. No, I'm Rose, your new roommate.
-Great.

15:23.834 --> 15:25.100
Welcome aboard.

15:27.200 --> 15:30.133
Well, she seems like a nice person.
Where's she from?

15:30.200 --> 15:33.033
-I don't know.
-Is she a beach person?

15:33.100 --> 15:36.100
-I don't know.
-How long have you lived together?

15:36.633 --> 15:38.834
-About a year.
-Really?

15:39.367 --> 15:42.900
Look, Rose, we all kind of go
our separate ways around here.

15:42.967 --> 15:45.433
And besides, you have your own friends,
don't you?

15:46.567 --> 15:50.367
Well, I've sort of lost touch
with my new beach friends.

15:50.967 --> 15:53.467
Well, that's ok. I'm a loner.

15:54.600 --> 15:55.667
A rebel.

15:57.367 --> 16:01.767
Wow! I can't believe
I'm actually living right on the beach.

16:02.333 --> 16:05.166
Oh, I remember the first time
I ever saw the ocean.

16:05.233 --> 16:08.100
It was on my honeymoon.
My husband Charlie and I

16:08.166 --> 16:10.033
drove from Minnesota to New York.

16:10.700 --> 16:13.100
Well, actually, we were driving
to California.

16:14.867 --> 16:19.266
We were young and in love,
and I was blowing in Charlie's ear.

16:19.800 --> 16:22.533
He lost his sense of direction
on the turnpike.

16:23.800 --> 16:24.967
We didn't care.

16:25.433 --> 16:26.433
We were just so...

16:27.734 --> 16:30.633
so crazy about each other...

16:33.200 --> 16:34.533
that, um...

16:45.367 --> 16:48.033
-Oh, hi, Dorothy.
-Blanche, what's all that stuff?

16:48.100 --> 16:51.166
Well, I know how down in the dumps
we've both been since Rose moved out,

16:51.233 --> 16:53.233
so I thought I'd buy us
a little something to cheer us up.

16:53.300 --> 16:56.133
-Oh, how sweet of you.
-I know.

16:56.900 --> 17:02.934
This is for me. This is for me.
This is for me.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.934
This was for you,
but it's so cute, now it's for me.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.633
This is for you.

17:10.633 --> 17:12.700
Edible panties.

17:14.633 --> 17:17.166
Oh, what a lovely sentiment.
Thank you.

17:17.233 --> 17:20.100
-Do you really like them?
-Oh, like 'em? I love 'em!

17:20.166 --> 17:22.233
In fact, I may have the waistband

17:22.300 --> 17:24.967
with a glass of milk
before I go to bed tonight.

17:26.367 --> 17:29.567
-What's going on here?
-Oh, I just did some shopping

17:29.633 --> 17:31.867
to cheer us up about Rose,
but it didn't work.

17:32.400 --> 17:33.834
Let me tell you two a story.

17:33.900 --> 17:34.900
-No.
-No.

17:35.567 --> 17:37.567
-A short story.
-(both) no!

17:37.633 --> 17:39.800
An anecdote.
I won't take no for an answer.

17:41.200 --> 17:44.200
Picture this. 90-year-old twins

17:44.266 --> 17:46.600
Ralph and Nunzio
sitting on a park bench.

17:47.066 --> 17:50.567
Ralph says to Nunzio, "Hey, whatever
happened to that streaking craze?"

17:50.633 --> 17:53.233
And Nunzio says, "What streaking craze?"

17:53.667 --> 17:56.600
Ralph says, "You know, when everybody
would take off their clothes

17:56.667 --> 17:58.000
and run down the street."

17:58.066 --> 18:02.700
So Nunzio says, "Hey, that sounds like
fun. I think I'll do it right now."

18:03.200 --> 18:07.133
So, 90 years old, he gets naked
and goes off down the street,

18:07.200 --> 18:11.133
right past these two old ladies,
Carlotta and Maria.

18:12.633 --> 18:16.100
Maria turns to Carlotta and says,
"What the hell was that?"

18:16.700 --> 18:18.100
Carlotta says, "I don't know,

18:18.166 --> 18:20.767
but whatever it was,
it sure needs ironing."

18:30.967 --> 18:32.367
Ma, what's the point?

18:32.433 --> 18:36.633
With a story, you get a point.
With an anecdote, pure entertainment.

18:38.900 --> 18:42.700
Look, we are very upset about Rose.
We don't want entertainment.

18:42.767 --> 18:46.367
All right, I'll give you a point without
a story, but just this once.

18:47.133 --> 18:49.633
If you really miss her, go tell her.

18:49.700 --> 18:51.500
Maybe she misses you too.

18:55.367 --> 18:57.166
I don't know, Blanche.
What do you think?

18:57.834 --> 18:59.100
I really miss her.

19:00.166 --> 19:02.667
-Oh, so do I. Let's go tell her.
-But wait a minute, Dorothy.

19:02.734 --> 19:04.800
If she misses us,
how come she hasn't called?

19:05.500 --> 19:07.233
Maybe she died, Blanche.

19:07.767 --> 19:09.200
It happened before.

19:10.266 --> 19:12.066
Maybe this time it took.

19:21.834 --> 19:24.100
-Hello, Stephanie.
-Hi, Rose.

19:24.166 --> 19:26.934
-Oh, Liz, I didn't know you were home.
-Oh, my flight got canceled.

19:27.633 --> 19:29.200
Do you realize this is the first time

19:29.266 --> 19:31.667
the three of us have been
together in two weeks?

19:32.233 --> 19:33.433
Hey, I have a great idea.

19:33.500 --> 19:36.367
Why don't I whip us roomies
up a great, big, fancy dinner?

19:36.433 --> 19:40.233
-Oh, sorry, Rose. I've already got plans.
-So do I. See you later.

19:40.667 --> 19:44.934
Look, Rose, you're a real sweet person,
but I have to be honest with you.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.667
We're all just roommates around here,
not friends.

19:47.734 --> 19:48.934
I hope that's ok.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.133
-Oh, that's fine. Great.
-Good. Good night, Rose.

19:54.400 --> 19:59.200
-Oh, hello. Is there a Rose Nylund--
-Dorothy! Blanche! Come on in!

19:59.266 --> 20:02.967
Oh, Liz, Steph, these are my old roommates
Dorothy and Blanche.

20:03.033 --> 20:04.166
-How do you do?
-Pleased to meet you.

20:04.233 --> 20:06.734
-Have to run. Sorry.
-Nice meeting you.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.133
I'll catch up with you two later.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.467
-What? When?
-You two kidders.

20:11.834 --> 20:14.600
Oh, we have so many running jokes.

20:15.767 --> 20:19.600
-Well, what brings you two here?
-Oh, no, thanks.

20:19.667 --> 20:20.867
We were in the neighborhood

20:20.934 --> 20:23.367
and we thought we'd,
you know, just drop by.

20:23.900 --> 20:25.266
Well, it's lucky you caught me.

20:25.333 --> 20:28.000
I mean, in the evening,
I'm usually out with Liz and Steph

20:28.066 --> 20:29.967
and the rest of the beach crowd.

20:30.033 --> 20:33.133
-Then everything's working out?
-I'll be honest with you.

20:33.200 --> 20:37.000
-Yes?
-It is a dream come true.

20:37.066 --> 20:40.266
-Great. Great. Just great.
-Yep.

20:41.266 --> 20:44.200
Rose, look, we did come here
for a reason.

20:44.266 --> 20:45.533
We wanted to tell you--

20:45.600 --> 20:48.533
Yeah, how happy we are
you're doing so well.

20:49.367 --> 20:52.667
-So I guess we should get going, huh?
-Oh, well, you don't have to rush off.

20:52.734 --> 20:55.133
Well, I thought you were meeting
your roommates.

20:55.200 --> 20:57.300
Oh, yeah. That's right.

20:58.033 --> 21:00.066
We're just going to be doing
some beach stuff.

21:00.133 --> 21:02.533
-Well, you take care.
-You, too.

21:02.600 --> 21:05.200
Oh, and you certainly
do have a pretty place here.

21:05.266 --> 21:07.266
Oh, yeah. Who wouldn't love it?

21:07.333 --> 21:10.066
-Well, bye-bye, Rose.
-Bye.

21:18.367 --> 21:20.300
-Hello.
<i>-Front door.</i>

21:20.734 --> 21:23.867
Hello, front door.
Did two ladies just leave?

21:23.934 --> 21:25.133
<i>Uh, yes, ma'am.</i>

21:25.967 --> 21:27.100
Thank you.

21:34.066 --> 21:36.600
Hello, front door. It's me again.

21:36.667 --> 21:41.333
Uh, my name is Rose Nylund in 118.

21:42.066 --> 21:46.100
We haven't actually met,
and I know this may sound a little bold,

21:46.166 --> 21:48.734
but I was wondering if...

21:49.467 --> 21:52.934
do you suppose you might like to go out
and have a cup of coffee or something?

21:53.500 --> 21:57.600
<i>I'd like to, but at the moment</i>
<i>I'm pretty heavily involved with 122.</i>

21:59.867 --> 22:01.000
Oh.

22:02.133 --> 22:03.633
Sounds like a nice number.

22:04.567 --> 22:05.700
Good night.

22:33.066 --> 22:34.734
I cannot believe it is Saturday night,

22:34.800 --> 22:38.200
and I, Blanche Devereaux,
the most witty, stunning...

22:38.567 --> 22:40.166
criminally sensuous woman

22:40.233 --> 22:42.700
to come out of the South since
miss Tallulah Bankhead...

22:43.367 --> 22:44.400
do not have a date.

22:44.900 --> 22:48.900
-So what? I don't have a date, either.
-What's your point?

22:53.967 --> 22:55.500
So, what do you want to do tonight?

22:55.934 --> 22:59.100
I guess we could be constructive
and clean our closets.

23:01.266 --> 23:02.734
We could go to a movie.

23:05.200 --> 23:08.800
We could do what we normally do,
talk dirty and pig out.

23:12.834 --> 23:15.700
-I'll get the bowls and the spoons.
-I'll get the ice cream.

23:15.767 --> 23:17.834
I'll get the chocolate sauce
and whipped cream.

23:23.367 --> 23:25.834
Anything interesting happen
while I was gone?

23:27.300 --> 23:29.967
-Does this mean you're back?
-If you'll have me.

23:34.367 --> 23:37.300
Ma got a letter from
Gina Marie Donatelli.

23:38.767 --> 23:41.100
Her cousin Joe
is hanging new wallpaper

23:41.166 --> 23:42.800
in Tony Bennett's guest bathroom.

23:42.867 --> 23:45.867
-Oh, I love Tony Bennett.
-Oh, so do I.

23:45.934 --> 23:47.400
He was always so sweet to me.

23:50.433 --> 23:54.533
-Blanche, you dated Tony Bennett?
-Honey, I did more than date him.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.433
He may have left his heart
in San Francisco,

23:56.500 --> 23:58.500
but he left his shorts on my radiator.

24:03.066 --> 24:04.667
You're kidding.

24:05.133 --> 24:06.433
Hell, no.

24:06.500 --> 24:07.767
Picture this...

24:13.467 --> 24:18.333
(theme music playing)
