00:07.560 --> 00:09.085
Okay, here's another one.

00:09.320 --> 00:13.370
TechCrunch says, "Laurie Bream
spotted lunching at the Rosewood

00:13.440 --> 00:15.886
"with yet another rising tech star,
Sam Herron.

00:15.960 --> 00:19.567
"Could this finally be
the new CEO of Pied Piper?"

00:20.080 --> 00:21.844
Maybe she's just fucking them all.

00:21.920 --> 00:24.207
It's been 10 days.
You know what would be nice?

00:24.280 --> 00:27.762
If I found out what Laurie wanted to do
with my company from her

00:27.880 --> 00:29.245
instead of the fucking Internet.

00:29.440 --> 00:32.967
Richard, the accountants
finally agreed to release our books.

00:33.600 --> 00:34.965
Okay.

00:36.160 --> 00:39.721
Hey, Richard.
ls there anything we should be doing?

00:39.800 --> 00:42.087
I don't know. Why are you asking me?
I'm not the CEO.

00:42.160 --> 00:43.286
There is no CEO.

00:43.360 --> 00:46.284
Because, apparently,
Jack's empty fucking chair

00:46.400 --> 00:47.731
is a better choice than I am.

00:47.800 --> 00:50.644
So, maybe ask the chair, see what it thinks.

00:51.800 --> 00:53.040
Say what you will about the chair,

00:53.120 --> 00:56.010
but at least it never told me
to build a fucking box.

00:56.240 --> 00:58.561
True.
Compared to Richard, it's a lot sturdier.

00:58.640 --> 01:01.644
And it has a lot less of
Barker's ass rubbed all over it.

01:13.360 --> 01:14.361
Are you serious?

01:14.840 --> 01:17.241
On top of Jack's
ridiculous severance package,

01:17.320 --> 01:20.164
we spent $1,000
on each one of your fucking monitors?

01:20.480 --> 01:23.643
We did? Huh. That's very pricey.

01:23.720 --> 01:26.929
So what? Raviga funded us for $5 million.

01:27.160 --> 01:29.686
There's no way we burned through all that.

01:29.760 --> 01:32.684
Do you have any idea how these deals work?
That money's tranched.

01:33.040 --> 01:35.771
- What's that?
- Well, from the Old French for "slice."

01:36.240 --> 01:38.004
Yeah, try to keep up, Dinesh.

01:38.080 --> 01:39.764
We get our money in stages.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.491
Right? We get $2 million upfront
to get us going,

01:42.560 --> 01:44.130
to design and build the product,

01:44.200 --> 01:47.727
but we don't get the next three million
until we take a product to market.

01:48.160 --> 01:49.491
And Jack was
okay with hemorrhaging money,

01:49.560 --> 01:51.483
because he thought
we were launching the box

01:51.560 --> 01:54.211
and then getting the next three million
in the next few weeks.

01:54.320 --> 01:56.721
But the platform will take
way longer to launch than that.

01:56.840 --> 02:00.447
Yes. So we are effectively
a $250 million company

02:00.520 --> 02:02.727
who just took $5 million in funding,

02:03.040 --> 02:04.804
and now we're dead-ass broke.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.804
Our burn rate is astronomical,

02:06.880 --> 02:09.247
and every day we sit in limbo like this...

02:13.040 --> 02:14.371
What if we don't?

02:15.200 --> 02:17.248
What if we don't sit in limbo?

02:17.320 --> 02:19.004
Like, fuck limbo, right?

02:19.720 --> 02:24.601
I mean, right now,
let's fire all these fucking sales assholes,

02:24.680 --> 02:27.047
and break the lease on this place
and get the fuck out of here.

02:27.400 --> 02:30.290
Can we do that?
There's no CEO here to approve any of that.

02:30.360 --> 02:34.001
Yeah. There's also no CEO here
to tell me not to do it, right?

02:34.120 --> 02:37.567
That's right. You're the CTO.
Technically, you're the ranking officer.

02:37.960 --> 02:38.961
Fucking A.

02:39.040 --> 02:42.203
Look, when, or if,
a new CEO comes to take over the company,

02:42.280 --> 02:46.205
we will do what they say
to the best of our abilities.

02:46.360 --> 02:48.647
But there is a very real possibility

02:48.720 --> 02:51.087
that there won't be a company
for them to take over

02:51.200 --> 02:53.282
if we don't do something about it now.

02:53.640 --> 02:56.371
- So, no more surprise waffles.
- What?

02:56.440 --> 02:57.885
- No more Chef Amy.
- No.

02:57.960 --> 03:00.201
And no more of these stupid offices, okay?

03:00.280 --> 03:01.611
We're going to move back to the hostel.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.526
- Fuck.
- Dinesh, we need to cut every corner,

03:04.600 --> 03:09.128
save every penny, and plow it
into engineers to build the platform. Okay?

03:09.200 --> 03:10.281
Then we will be back on track.

03:10.360 --> 03:13.603
So Gilfoyle, Dinesh,
pack up those gold-plated monitors

03:14.160 --> 03:15.764
because we are selling them.

03:16.040 --> 03:18.202
Jared, come on. Let's do this.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.448
Hmm. Well, that sucks.

03:25.640 --> 03:26.641
Jesus.

03:31.480 --> 03:34.165
Okay, guys.
Can I have your attention, please?

03:34.480 --> 03:35.720
Yeah, next goal wins.

03:35.800 --> 03:39.327
No. Now. Sorry, it's got to be now.

03:39.520 --> 03:42.046
And so, bring it in, Dang,

03:42.120 --> 03:45.010
Chef Amy, Jan the Man,
Keith, Northeast Regional.

03:45.120 --> 03:46.246
And do you still have your shadow?

03:46.480 --> 03:47.766
- Yo.
- Hey, there he is.

03:47.840 --> 03:49.604
Okay, uh, circle up.

03:49.840 --> 03:51.888
All right, I have some news for you.

03:52.160 --> 03:53.650
Is this about the new CEO?

03:53.720 --> 03:55.324
Recode is saying
that it could be Reid Hoffman.

03:55.640 --> 03:58.405
No. I don't know anything about that.

03:58.480 --> 04:02.166
No, no. There's no new CEO.
There's no new employees of any kind.

04:02.240 --> 04:06.245
There's actually... It's more about
you guys becoming former employees.

04:07.640 --> 04:10.564
So, look,
we're heading in a different direction.

04:11.160 --> 04:13.242
And what that means is,
if I haven't taken you aside

04:13.320 --> 04:16.802
and spoken to you privately about staying on,
that does mean that you are

04:16.880 --> 04:18.370
terminated immediately.

04:18.480 --> 04:22.610
So, Dang, Chef Amy, Jan the Man, all of Sales,

04:22.680 --> 04:24.648
I am really sorry about all this.

04:24.720 --> 04:27.451
Are you sure that you can fire us,
like, legally?

04:28.480 --> 04:30.130
Yeah. Yes, absolutely.

04:30.200 --> 04:33.363
I'm CTO. I'm the highest ranking officer,
so yes, answer.

04:33.680 --> 04:36.524
You're still CTO? Laurie hasn't fired you yet?

04:37.360 --> 04:39.488
No, she has... Why would she fire me?

04:39.560 --> 04:41.642
Well, Code/Rag said
that your tech is mediocre

04:41.760 --> 04:43.728
and that's why no one will take the CEO job.

04:43.800 --> 04:44.961
- What?
- Yeah.

04:45.040 --> 04:46.280
That's why I assumed that you'd been fired.

04:47.040 --> 04:49.520
Uh, maybe she's waiting till Friday to fire him.

04:49.880 --> 04:51.962
- Oh, that makes sense.
- No, it doesn't make sense.

04:52.040 --> 04:53.644
That's not what's happening, okay?

04:53.720 --> 04:55.484
I'm not getting fired. That's crazy.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.688
I haven't read this article.
Okay, maybe I'm too busy

04:57.760 --> 05:00.366
making the tech awesome,
because it's not mediocre.

05:00.440 --> 05:02.920
It's actually...
Turns out, it's fucking revolutionary.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.082
So, I guess that's the truth.

05:05.200 --> 05:08.124
And also, I'm not fired,
these guys aren't fired, you all are fired.

05:08.200 --> 05:11.249
Everyone from this wall is fired.
So, enjoy being fired.

05:18.920 --> 05:20.410
Jesus. This is a good apple.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.722
- Where did you get this?
- Oh, I have a fruit guy.

05:23.560 --> 05:24.721
Fantastic.

05:25.280 --> 05:26.770
Read me back what we have so far.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.323
Uh, "Bachman and Bighetti
shall each include in this venture

05:30.400 --> 05:32.687
"any and all portfolio companies.

05:32.760 --> 05:35.570
"The exception shall be for Pied Piper."

05:35.920 --> 05:38.730
Hey, how come Pied Piper is not a part of it?

05:38.800 --> 05:41.690
'Cause, you know, I actually used to
work there, so maybe it should be?

05:41.760 --> 05:45.128
Big Head, Pied Piper
is no longer an incubating entity.

05:45.240 --> 05:47.686
It would be unfair to you,
and to me, and to them

05:47.760 --> 05:50.206
for me to relinquish
any of my shares in their company.

05:50.720 --> 05:55.248
And besides, like you,
I'm giving up everything else I have of value,

05:55.320 --> 05:57.891
shares, options, cash, liquid assets.

05:59.120 --> 06:01.043
Wait. So all my assets?

06:01.400 --> 06:02.890
That seems like kind of a lot.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.170
It is a lot, Big Head.
We're both giving up a lot.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.368
We're both gaining a lot also.

06:08.440 --> 06:11.125
And that's what
every successful partnership is about.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.809
Committing fully, blindly,
and without concern of the consequences,

06:14.880 --> 06:16.962
-like marriage.
- Right.

06:17.760 --> 06:19.125
Oh, here. Get this down.

06:19.480 --> 06:23.690
In the event of a tie vote,
any disagreement shall be settled

06:24.480 --> 06:27.802
with a toss of a coin
of Mr. Bachman's choosing.

06:29.960 --> 06:31.166
What the fuck are you doing in here?

06:31.400 --> 06:32.811
Can't you see we're having a meeting?

06:34.240 --> 06:36.049
Go ahead, Big Head, read that back to me.

06:36.280 --> 06:39.170
Oh, um, "In the event of a tie..."

06:40.240 --> 06:41.571
The fucking juicer's broken.

06:41.640 --> 06:43.483
This is the second one in two days!

06:46.000 --> 06:49.925
C.J. Cantwell of Code/Rag writes, and I quote,

06:50.000 --> 06:52.446
"Having met this many candidates
without closing one,

06:52.840 --> 06:56.447
"one can't help wonder
why Pied Piper can't land a man.

06:57.160 --> 06:59.766
"Could the vaunted tech
of founder Richard Hendricks,

06:59.840 --> 07:03.083
"whom I once called
the next Mark Zuckerberg,

07:03.160 --> 07:08.166
"be turning Pied Piper from
a unicorn into a donkey wearing a party hat?"

07:08.640 --> 07:11.769
- And?
- And she's slandering my tech.

07:11.840 --> 07:13.683
It's the one thing that's working around here.

07:13.760 --> 07:17.924
Look, I think if I just talk to her,
I can get her to change it.

07:18.040 --> 07:21.601
No. I do not want you to engage
with a muckraker like C.J. Cantwell

07:21.680 --> 07:23.808
simply to salve your male ego.

07:24.120 --> 07:26.122
My male ego
has nothing to do with this, Laurie.

07:26.200 --> 07:30.489
Look, good coders won't want to work
for a company they think has shitty tech.

07:30.560 --> 07:33.723
I need to get ahead of this now.
And if I don't, we're done.

07:33.800 --> 07:37.850
Richard, whether you appreciate this or not,
I do actually have a plan here.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.844
You can meet with everyone
in Palo Alto to replace me as CEO.

07:40.920 --> 07:42.524
I'm not going to tell you how to do your job.

07:42.600 --> 07:45.524
Okay, but I need to do
something about this, now.

07:45.760 --> 07:47.967
She's calling us the next Clinkle.

07:48.480 --> 07:49.925
Clinkle, Laurie. Clinkle.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.002
You do know
what happened to Clinkle, right?

07:52.080 --> 07:54.560
- Do you want us to be Clinkle?
- Please, just stop saying "Clinkle."

07:54.640 --> 07:56.005
It jars the ear.

07:56.120 --> 07:59.602
Fine. I will have my office set up an interview.

08:00.240 --> 08:02.481
But I want you
to present yourself well, Richard.

08:02.560 --> 08:04.562
Be showered, groomed, well-dressed.

08:04.800 --> 08:08.486
And you will need to sit down with our head
of PR beforehand to go over talking points.

08:08.560 --> 08:09.561
Why?

08:10.080 --> 08:12.242
Because you are in an emotional state,

08:12.320 --> 08:15.767
and when you are emotional,
you become highly inarticulate.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.002
Well, I don't say that's true.

08:21.560 --> 08:22.971
Okay. Yes. Fine. Sure.

08:23.040 --> 08:24.041
Um...

08:24.480 --> 08:25.766
And thank you, Laurie.

08:30.320 --> 08:33.961
Before you ask, the answer is yes,
I did blow all these hard drives clean.

08:34.320 --> 08:36.607
- So...
- You really are a moron.

08:36.919 --> 08:39.684
The only way to really blow
the hard drives clean

08:39.760 --> 08:41.364
is to take a drill and punch a hole through it.

08:41.440 --> 08:45.047
All right, calm down, Snowden.
I zeroed them all out, we're fine.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.009
Welcome, welcome.

08:47.080 --> 08:50.243
Uh, we have lost our lease,
so everything must go.

08:50.480 --> 08:54.087
The chairs are arranged
in ascending order of lumbar support.

08:54.160 --> 08:55.844
So, have a gander.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.529
Oh, uh, word to the wise,

08:59.640 --> 09:02.644
the Haworths are like a spa day
for the buttocks.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.803
Yeah, and I have a fragile posterior.

09:04.880 --> 09:07.451
My aunt used to call me "glasshole."

09:08.360 --> 09:09.407
So, you can take it from me.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.125
Look at these fucking maggots.

09:11.880 --> 09:16.010
Crawling all over our garbage,
leaving their slime of mediocrity.

09:16.960 --> 09:19.167
Ah, I thought you'd feel right at home
in a marketplace,

09:19.240 --> 09:21.242
haggling, selling your monkey paws,

09:21.320 --> 09:24.051
looking for Indiana Jones in a wicker basket.

09:24.160 --> 09:26.288
Okay. Marion was in the wicker basket,

09:26.360 --> 09:29.250
Indiana Jones was tipping them over,
you fucking idiot.

09:30.080 --> 09:31.081
Hi.

09:31.720 --> 09:32.881
Let me know if you have any questions.

09:32.960 --> 09:36.362
Well, how about that? I made my first sale.

09:36.880 --> 09:40.248
I've organized a lot of estate sales,
so this is kind of my wheelhouse.

09:40.320 --> 09:42.288
- What?
- I have a lot of elderly friends.

09:42.680 --> 09:43.841
Oh, that is a fun item.

09:44.080 --> 09:46.367
That's a hardware fan.

09:48.560 --> 09:50.688
You've got the yellow hoodie on today.

09:51.080 --> 09:52.650
Oh, yeah.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.450
Wait a second.

09:54.680 --> 09:56.250
None of these are signed.

09:56.520 --> 09:59.967
Oh, yeah. Urn, it's just my business manager
had some questions

10:00.040 --> 10:02.486
about the way some of this stuff
was being arranged.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.810
Like, he said something about
how it's not a corporation.

10:05.880 --> 10:09.282
It's just a general partnership or something.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.362
I mean, he told me I didn't understand,
which is true,

10:11.440 --> 10:12.965
so he wanted to maybe talk to you about it.

10:13.040 --> 10:15.520
So you want to lawyer up?
Is that what we're doing?

10:16.120 --> 10:17.610
I don't think he has a law degree.

10:17.720 --> 10:21.964
Big Head, I would hope that a handshake deal
would be good enough for you.

10:22.480 --> 10:24.005
Because we're headed down a long road,

10:24.080 --> 10:26.890
and that road must be paved with trust.
Blind trust.

10:27.520 --> 10:30.763
And you bringing in these so-called "experts"

10:31.400 --> 10:32.606
really gives me pause,

10:32.800 --> 10:34.484
and it insults my honor.

10:35.720 --> 10:38.644
Huh. Uh, sorry, hold on. I got to take this.
I'll be right back.

10:38.720 --> 10:40.563
Sorry. Hello?

10:41.720 --> 10:43.404
Hey. Uh, how do I look?

10:43.960 --> 10:46.406
If I'm being honest,
like a ventriloquist dummy.

10:49.360 --> 10:52.648
Uh, okay.
Well, you know, that's actually kind of fitting,

10:52.720 --> 10:55.326
because I'm on my way to Raviga right now

10:55.400 --> 10:58.370
to meet with a PR person
to tell me exactly what to say

10:58.440 --> 11:00.363
to a reporter and how to say it.

11:00.440 --> 11:01.566
Well, that does make sense.

11:01.720 --> 11:04.405
You do tend to babble on
when you're under pressure.

11:06.240 --> 11:07.526
Why does this thing people say?

11:10.560 --> 11:11.846
Why indeed?

11:11.920 --> 11:13.251
That was weird.

11:13.960 --> 11:16.122
I just got a call
from Laurie Bream's office at Raviga,

11:16.200 --> 11:19.522
asking if I'd want to interview
for the job of CEO at Pied Piper.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.731
What? Are you fucking kidding me?

11:22.800 --> 11:24.211
That's exactly what I said.

11:24.280 --> 11:27.204
Then I said no, and then we both hung up.

11:27.280 --> 11:31.001
I mean, I assume they hung up.
I had already hung up, so...

11:31.920 --> 11:33.410
Wow. Wow.

11:33.480 --> 11:37.201
Okay. Okay. Yeah, great. Big Head.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.930
Big Head? Fucking kidding me?

11:39.280 --> 11:40.406
What the fuck is going on?

11:40.480 --> 11:43.290
Big Head, you can insult me all you want

11:43.360 --> 11:45.522
by involving your self-described shylocks,

11:45.640 --> 11:48.530
but to insult Richard and humiliate him,

11:48.600 --> 11:50.807
that's like kicking a child
who's done nothing to deserve it.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.168
I may not be able to finish my ramen.

11:54.120 --> 11:55.485
I told them no.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.451
Hi there. Richard Hendricks
here to see Dawn Simon, PR.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.807
Sure, she'll be meeting you
in the small conference room.

12:01.920 --> 12:04.321
- Um, do you need me...
- No, no. I, uh, I know where it is.

12:04.400 --> 12:07.244
It turns out, I actually know something.

12:07.320 --> 12:08.560
I'm not a fucking idiot.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.243
- Richard Hendricks. Hi.
- Before we get any further,

12:14.320 --> 12:16.561
I just want you to know
that I'm not going to be yelling at you,

12:16.640 --> 12:17.880
but I probably am going to yell.

12:18.640 --> 12:20.130
- Okay.
- Okay. Uh...

12:20.200 --> 12:22.931
Because this is bullshit.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.401
Honestly, I mean, I get it.
This is your job. You're in PR.

12:25.480 --> 12:28.245
Your job is to pretty much tell me
what I can't say.

12:28.320 --> 12:30.527
I mean, when I talk to this reporter,
I probably can't say

12:30.600 --> 12:34.366
how fucked up it is that Laurie Bream fired me

12:34.480 --> 12:36.801
and then replaced me with Action Jack Barker.

12:36.880 --> 12:39.531
I probably can't say
how the only action he took

12:39.600 --> 12:42.490
was to essentially pick the wrong product
and then bleed the company dry.

12:42.960 --> 12:46.601
And I probably can't say
how fucking pissed off I am

12:46.680 --> 12:50.401
that Laurie Bream is out there
gallivanting around the Valley,

12:50.480 --> 12:56.044
interviewing every dickhole on Earth
for my job, including Big Head,

12:56.120 --> 12:57.451
a man that I fired, by the way.

12:57.520 --> 12:59.010
And no offense, I like him. I do actually.

12:59.080 --> 13:00.923
He's a close friend of mine,
been that way for years.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.401
But he is a bit of a simpleton,
and his name's fucking Big Head.

13:03.480 --> 13:04.891
But, okay, look.

13:06.320 --> 13:09.802
I want to be CEO of Pied Piper, okay?

13:09.880 --> 13:13.930
It is my company. I worked my ass off
to build this company, okay?

13:14.000 --> 13:15.650
That's my job. I deserve it.

13:15.720 --> 13:18.121
And it fucking kills me that Laurie is out there

13:18.200 --> 13:20.965
trying to give it to someone else,
anyone but me.

13:21.040 --> 13:23.441
But I probably can't say that, can I?

13:24.040 --> 13:25.724
You can say anything you want to say to me.

13:26.520 --> 13:27.521
All right.

13:29.240 --> 13:30.685
Thank you for meeting me, Monica.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.003
You are from...

13:35.440 --> 13:36.726
Baltimore.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.368
H.L. Mencken hails from Baltimore.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.047
Who?

13:44.240 --> 13:45.810
Widely perceived as a racist,

13:47.400 --> 13:49.687
but his work on the English language
is comprehensive,

13:49.760 --> 13:54.243
and his perspicacious skewering
of evangelicals is laudable.

13:55.080 --> 13:59.085
Monica, my mission here
is not merely to have fun.

14:00.360 --> 14:01.691
That's okay.

14:02.560 --> 14:05.245
When I voted against you
at the board meeting, I just want...

14:05.320 --> 14:08.529
Monica, this is not about you, for once.

14:09.240 --> 14:11.288
I brought you here to say

14:12.760 --> 14:15.286
- I am sorry.
- For...

14:15.400 --> 14:17.129
Ah, yes, of course.
You are going to make me say it.

14:17.200 --> 14:18.326
Why am I not surprised?

14:19.240 --> 14:21.766
I made a mistake with Richard Hendricks.

14:21.960 --> 14:23.962
And out I went, right on my ass.

14:24.040 --> 14:28.841
And then Laurie put that jackhole Barker
in to bankrupt the company.

14:28.920 --> 14:30.570
But does she cop to that? No, no, no.

14:30.680 --> 14:32.842
Because the Laurie-tron 6,000

14:32.920 --> 14:34.809
isn't programmed to admit
when she's made a mistake.

14:35.560 --> 14:37.130
I made an error.

14:37.720 --> 14:40.849
Wow, um, that's really big of you to admit.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.560
I should not have removed him as CEO,

14:43.640 --> 14:47.087
and installing Jack Barker in his place
only compounded that error.

14:47.160 --> 14:50.801
But if that's true, then why are you meeting
with so many other CEO candidates?

14:51.040 --> 14:54.647
I am meeting publically
with a number of high-value candidates

14:54.720 --> 14:55.846
I know to be unavailable,

14:55.920 --> 14:59.402
as well as with a number
of less-qualified candidates

14:59.480 --> 15:01.687
with whom Richard compares favorably.

15:02.240 --> 15:03.571
That's why you called Big Head.

15:03.640 --> 15:09.124
Yes. You see, Richard must not be perceived
as being the most expedient candidate.

15:09.200 --> 15:12.886
He must be seen as the correct candidate.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.770
This is very exciting for Richard.

15:15.840 --> 15:19.811
I have been impressed by his conduct
in a tough situation.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.765
- He's shown mettle.
- Mmm-hmm. Definitely.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.764
Therefore, I will call for a vote
at the next board meeting

15:25.840 --> 15:26.841
to offer him the job.

15:27.080 --> 15:31.210
That is, of course, assuming he continues
to demonstrate an air of professionalism.

15:33.280 --> 15:36.090
Hi, Dawn. Are you waiting for someone?

15:36.160 --> 15:38.288
Yes. I'm supposed to be meeting
with Richard Hendricks

15:38.360 --> 15:40.249
before he sits down with a Code/Rag reporter.

15:40.720 --> 15:43.769
Oh, that's weird. I saw him earlier.

15:43.920 --> 15:45.081
And that is why...

15:46.560 --> 15:48.085
I'm just being honest here.

15:49.680 --> 15:52.889
I think that Peter Gregory
is better off where he is.

15:53.960 --> 15:57.123
Just saying, because if he knew
what Laurie was doing to his company,

15:57.200 --> 15:59.362
he probably would want to take a gun
and blow his brains out.

16:01.120 --> 16:02.485
Uh, okay.

16:02.560 --> 16:05.370
We should probably start talking about
the things that I can say.

16:05.640 --> 16:07.802
Um...

16:07.880 --> 16:10.042
Richard. Richard Hendricks?

16:11.680 --> 16:13.569
Yes. Who are you?

16:13.640 --> 16:15.642
Dawn Simon, Raviga's publicity director.

16:21.760 --> 16:22.807
So that would make you...

16:23.800 --> 16:25.723
C.J. Cantwell, Code/Rag.

16:26.280 --> 16:28.487
Thank you, I think I have everything I need.

16:34.760 --> 16:36.250
Please tell me that went well.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.724
Yep. No, yeah.

16:42.520 --> 16:43.806
It, uh... It was gone great.

16:43.960 --> 16:46.964
Yep. It had gone.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.044
It was great.

16:50.560 --> 16:51.800
Uh, she's a great guy.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.690
Really. Girl. She's cool.
She's a cool one.

16:55.600 --> 16:58.444
Cool. I can just... I can get out here?

16:58.600 --> 16:59.726
- Just 'cause I got another thing.
- Yeah.

16:59.880 --> 17:02.565
Slow down. Listen to me.
Look, in my defense,

17:02.640 --> 17:04.688
I said those were all the things
I can't say, okay?

17:04.760 --> 17:06.285
So it's kind of like I didn't even say them.

17:06.359 --> 17:09.045
But you did say them,
at a meeting you scheduled with a reporter.

17:09.119 --> 17:11.248
Reporter? Come on, you're a tech blogger.

17:11.319 --> 17:13.971
Oh, really. Hard to see
why Laurie insisted on a PR rep for you.

17:16.280 --> 17:19.921
Look, uh, just...
Tell me what I can do to kill this?

17:20.640 --> 17:22.324
- You want me to spike the story?
- Yes, please.

17:22.400 --> 17:26.121
Give me something better. I don't know,
go on a drunken racist Twitter rant,

17:26.200 --> 17:28.521
or get in your car, run over Elon Musk,

17:28.600 --> 17:30.967
and give me an exclusive from jail. Yeah.

17:31.040 --> 17:32.883
Otherwise, I'm posting this
at noon tomorrow, so...

17:32.960 --> 17:35.327
No, no, no, no. Look. Look.

17:35.400 --> 17:37.289
If you want to leave,
you're going to have to run me over!

17:47.160 --> 17:48.810
These offices were nice.

17:49.760 --> 17:52.001
Now everything looks so bare.

17:52.080 --> 17:56.005
Yeah. There is a certain sad vulnerability to it.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.367
Have you ever seen a naked dead person?

17:59.440 --> 18:01.807
No. No. No.

18:02.640 --> 18:03.641
Hmm.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.401
Well, the good news is, we cleared

18:06.520 --> 18:09.922
almost $70,000 from selling all this stuff.

18:10.200 --> 18:12.680
That's not enough
to afford all the coders we need.

18:13.320 --> 18:14.481
We need at least a dozen.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.650
Where would we even put them now?

18:17.800 --> 18:18.847
Shall we?

18:24.920 --> 18:26.285
Wait. Where's my hard drive?

18:26.680 --> 18:27.966
What did it look like?

18:28.040 --> 18:30.884
It just looked like
a normal standard hard drive.

18:31.040 --> 18:34.123
- You sure it was in your bag?
- Yeah, it was in my bag.

18:35.600 --> 18:40.367
Could it maybe have slid out
and was next to your bag,

18:40.440 --> 18:42.602
which was next to
all the hard drives we got rid of?

18:44.560 --> 18:47.689
Did you sell my personal hard drive?

18:48.000 --> 18:50.241
You didn't happen to
wipe that one clean, too, did you?

18:51.720 --> 18:53.848
- My personal hard drive?
- Yeah.

18:53.920 --> 18:56.526
No! Fuck!

18:57.000 --> 18:59.241
So it had our confidential IP on it?

18:59.560 --> 19:03.963
Yes. All the work we did on the platform,
the box, everything.

19:04.080 --> 19:07.846
Okay, well, what's gone
is not necessarily lost.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.128
Okay, we just need to find it.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.248
I found my retainer in the school dumpster.

19:12.320 --> 19:15.369
I found my biological father
in a militia up in the Ozarks.

19:15.440 --> 19:16.521
This should be no problem.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.445
Don't worry, Dinesh, we'll find it.

19:27.160 --> 19:28.730
Uh...

19:28.800 --> 19:30.962
Does he not know we're moving out?

19:31.360 --> 19:32.407
Should We tell him?

19:33.720 --> 19:37.122
No. Jack paid him in full up front,

19:38.480 --> 19:40.448
and he seems so at peace.

19:40.760 --> 19:43.411
- All right.
- All right.

19:49.520 --> 19:52.364
I am such an idiot.

19:52.440 --> 19:53.885
You've got no choice, Richard.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.850
You need to go in to Laurie
and just tell her what happened.

19:57.080 --> 20:01.130
What? It's bad enough she's going to find out
what I said after this piece posts online.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.965
You want me to go in
and tell her right to her face?

20:04.040 --> 20:05.041
No fucking way.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.566
You could spin it. Tell her you're sorry.

20:07.640 --> 20:11.281
I had it.
I had my old CEO job back, and I fucked it up.

20:11.800 --> 20:13.131
I'll get it.

20:15.560 --> 20:19.360
Ah. The Super Angel Premium Deluxe.

20:20.360 --> 20:21.600
In the flesh.

20:21.960 --> 20:26.170
Yeah, I had to drive to San Mateo
to get one that has auto-reverse.

20:26.320 --> 20:27.446
Why didn't you send your assistant?

20:28.080 --> 20:29.764
She was on the phone, so...

20:29.840 --> 20:34.721
Well, Big Head,
it takes a brave man to admit his mistakes,

20:34.800 --> 20:39.362
and with this token of apology,
you've officially righted your wrong.

20:40.040 --> 20:41.883
Consider the matter resolved.

20:42.880 --> 20:44.041
Cool.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.446
Traditionally, the offender
shakes the offendee's hand,

20:47.520 --> 20:49.090
so you would come to me.

20:51.160 --> 20:52.685
That's an honest Thomas.

20:53.880 --> 20:58.408
Gentlemen, Monica,
from the ashes of whatever happens here

20:58.680 --> 21:02.685
will rise the phoenix
that shall be known as Bachmanity.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.444
That's what you're gonna call your company?

21:05.800 --> 21:08.280
Yeah, well, before it was gonna be
Bachman Capital.

21:08.640 --> 21:11.849
Because I provide the Bachman,
and he provides the capital.

21:12.480 --> 21:16.280
Yeah, but then, we compromised,
and made it Bachmanity,

21:16.360 --> 21:20.365
'cause it's Bachman from him
and then the "etti" from me.

21:20.840 --> 21:22.080
So it's two syllables each.

21:22.520 --> 21:26.081
Very much into keeping score, this one.
Have a seat.

21:26.160 --> 21:28.322
I'll go fetch the documents and my Montblanc.

21:28.920 --> 21:29.921
Psst!

21:33.560 --> 21:37.770
So, slight hiccup. I tracked down
the woman who bought the drive,

21:37.840 --> 21:40.127
but she wasn't interested in selling it back.

21:40.760 --> 21:43.491
Apparently, she's already given it
to her elderly father

21:43.560 --> 21:46.245
and booked the Geek Squad
to set it up for him this afternoon.

21:46.320 --> 21:49.244
What about my drive?
All our stuff is on there.

21:49.760 --> 21:51.091
I think we're fine.

21:51.160 --> 21:54.881
She said he mostly uses the computer
to download photos of old ships.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.004
I don't think he'll be able to find our files
even if he wanted to.

21:58.240 --> 22:01.483
Well, I mean, hopefully. But still...

22:01.640 --> 22:04.007
Dinesh is right, this is sloppy.

22:04.640 --> 22:05.801
Where does this guy live?

22:06.560 --> 22:08.608
Shit, Richard, I'm sorry, man.

22:08.720 --> 22:10.404
Initial here and here.

22:10.760 --> 22:14.287
No. It's okay. I deserve it. It's my own fault.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.129
And you're gonna wanna sign here.

22:16.200 --> 22:18.646
Still, man, that just really sucks.

22:18.720 --> 22:21.530
You know, I bet you wish
you could just scrub the whole Internet,

22:21.600 --> 22:23.250
like Gavin Belson does, right?

22:24.280 --> 22:25.281
Whoa, weird.

22:26.160 --> 22:28.527
Every single one of my signatures
looks totally different.

22:28.600 --> 22:30.568
- Wait. What?
- Yeah, look.

22:30.640 --> 22:33.530
This one's in cursive,
this one's just printed, and then I...

22:33.600 --> 22:35.887
One I just wrote "Big Head,"
but that's not going to hold up.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.686
No, no, no. Did you just say
Gavin Belson scrubbed the Internet?

22:40.160 --> 22:41.207
Oh, yeah.

22:43.360 --> 22:45.522
Yeah, and then they told me to my face,

22:45.600 --> 22:47.489
that after Nucleus was shut down,

22:47.560 --> 22:49.608
Gavin had one of his execs
order them to scrub

22:49.720 --> 22:52.803
all negative mentions of Nucleus
off of Hooli Search.

22:53.920 --> 22:56.526
Wow. Okay, when exactly did this happen?

22:56.800 --> 22:58.962
No, no. Actually...

22:59.040 --> 23:02.567
You told me that you would spike my story
if I give you something better.

23:02.640 --> 23:03.641
This is better, right?

23:03.920 --> 23:05.922
Yeah. Light-years better, actually.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.570
Your story's spiked. Great, okay.

23:07.640 --> 23:10.849
As long as we're trading apples
for comparable apples,

23:10.920 --> 23:13.526
I've got a fresh and juicy
that's ripe for the picking.

23:14.000 --> 23:19.086
Ms. Cantwell, what say you to an exclusive
on the launch of a future financial behemoth?

23:19.440 --> 23:21.169
How about we just stick with Gavin?

23:21.680 --> 23:23.728
Gavin for Richard? Deal?

23:23.960 --> 23:24.961
Done.

23:26.200 --> 23:28.680
Monica, do you really need to be here?

23:36.480 --> 23:39.086
- Geek Squad.
- The computer's right here.

23:41.600 --> 23:42.840
You're not wearing the shirt.

23:44.040 --> 23:45.565
I spilled coffee on it.

23:46.240 --> 23:47.366
I'm a nerd.

24:07.080 --> 24:10.243
All right. We're all set here.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.087
Yes.

24:19.160 --> 24:20.241
Can I have my hard drive?

24:23.320 --> 24:26.130
Oh, no. You fucking dick.

24:28.680 --> 24:29.681
Shit.

24:34.520 --> 24:35.965
You're gonna be replacing it.

24:43.200 --> 24:44.929
You're back. How did the board meeting go?

24:45.600 --> 24:46.601
Well, um...

24:46.680 --> 24:53.040
You're looking at the past, present,
and possibly future CEO of Pied Piper.

24:54.960 --> 24:56.564
Oh, that is...

24:57.480 --> 24:59.130
Oh, congratulations!

24:59.240 --> 25:00.730
- Jared...
- My captain.

25:00.800 --> 25:04.202
"O Captain! my Captain!
Rise up and hear the bells

25:04.560 --> 25:08.246
"Rise up-for you the flag is flung
for you the bugle trills."

25:08.480 --> 25:09.641
All right. Dismissed.

25:11.280 --> 25:15.569
Well, uh, just to remind you,
Pied Piper is still a sinking ship, so...

25:15.640 --> 25:17.210
Enough with the maritime metaphors.

25:17.280 --> 25:20.523
This is honestly, like, the best birthday gift
that I ever could've asked for.

25:20.880 --> 25:22.484
-It's your birthday?
- Uh, I don't know.

25:22.760 --> 25:25.127
The CPS worker
couldn't find my birth certificate,

25:26.400 --> 25:27.970
but maybe now it is.

25:28.320 --> 25:33.042
And in other good news, we've managed
to fill out our engineering team.

25:33.640 --> 25:35.369
Did you tell them that my Fage's off-limits?

25:35.600 --> 25:37.443
Oh, that won't be a worry.

25:37.520 --> 25:38.521
Come meet them.

25:38.640 --> 25:41.450
All right, guys, who wants to start work
on the fragment uploader?

25:41.560 --> 25:43.801
Uh, Gleb, why don't you and Sanjay take it?

25:43.880 --> 25:45.484
Richard, say hi.

25:45.560 --> 25:50.361
Yes. Hello, lam, um, Richard Hendricks,
the CEO of Pied Piper.

25:50.800 --> 25:52.006
- Welcome aboard.
- Hi.

25:52.080 --> 25:53.206
What the fuck is going on here?

25:53.320 --> 25:55.322
We got a little creative.

25:55.840 --> 25:58.366
Um, I read that the woman who started Pegg'd

25:58.440 --> 26:02.411
built her entire app using a team of coders
from India she never met in person.

26:02.480 --> 26:04.642
And it only cost $15,000.

26:04.760 --> 26:08.560
Yeah, so we figured why limit ourselves
to a few expensive people in the Valley,

26:08.640 --> 26:12.087
when we could afford a full complement
if we outsourced?

26:12.160 --> 26:15.369
Um, Richard, I know we said
that we sold everything in the offices

26:15.440 --> 26:19.490
to pay for these guys,
but that was not exactly true.

26:20.160 --> 26:22.003
Um, we kept one thing.

26:22.840 --> 26:23.841
Okay.

26:27.560 --> 26:28.891
Oh, wow. It's the CEO chair.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.285
Ah.

26:34.360 --> 26:35.566
Have a seat.

26:36.520 --> 26:37.681
Okay.

26:41.520 --> 26:42.601
Okay, uh...

26:43.320 --> 26:44.970
Well, why don't we

26:45.360 --> 26:48.682
go around the room, or screens, or whatever,
and introduce ourselves?

26:50.040 --> 26:53.283
Hello, my name is Gleb. I am in Bulgaria.

26:55.040 --> 26:57.964
Hello, I am Sanjay. I am here in Mumbai, India.

26:58.040 --> 26:59.405
- You having trouble?
- No.

26:59.480 --> 27:02.563
Hello. I am Elisabet.
I am speaking to you from Estonia.

27:03.800 --> 27:05.290
Uh, thank you for the...

27:06.200 --> 27:07.964
Whoa!

27:08.040 --> 27:09.451
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

27:09.520 --> 27:11.761
-It's fine. I got it. I got it.
- Dude.

27:11.840 --> 27:14.127
- I got it. I got it.
- You're making a great first impression.

27:14.480 --> 27:16.323
Sorry. Can we go to the...
Do the names one more time?
