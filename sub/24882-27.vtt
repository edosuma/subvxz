That's right.
You know what?

02:18.834 --> 02:19.767
They're gonna
be here any minute.

02:19.834 --> 02:20.800
That's right.

02:20.867 --> 02:23.000
Animals:
No more! No more! No more!

02:23.066 --> 02:25.934
- No more! No more!

02:26.000 --> 02:28.400
No more! No more!

02:28.467 --> 02:29.967
Ugh! It's terrible.

02:30.033 --> 02:31.800
Terrible!

02:31.867 --> 02:34.400
- Oh, it's old MacDonald.
- Yeah, yeah!

02:34.467 --> 02:38.033
Um, excuse Elmo,
Mr. Old MacDonald.

02:38.100 --> 02:40.567
Um, what's going on?

02:40.633 --> 02:43.934
Oh, laddie, it's me
wee farm animals.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.934
- They're all on strike.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.567
They say they won't sing
our song anymore.

02:49.633 --> 02:52.467
Wait. They won't sing
"Old MacDonald?"

02:52.533 --> 02:53.900
Rosita: Oh, no. ¿Por qué?

02:53.967 --> 02:56.066
No more! No more!

02:56.133 --> 02:59.133
Wait. Why won't you sing?

02:59.200 --> 03:02.633
'Cause we always sing it
the same way. That's why.

03:02.700 --> 03:05.800
Every time,
it's "moo moo here,
moo moo there."

03:05.867 --> 03:07.667
"Baa baa here,
baa baa there."

03:07.734 --> 03:08.667
"Bawk bawk bawk,
bawk bawk bawk."

03:08.734 --> 03:09.767
What she said.

03:09.834 --> 03:12.800
But, that is the way
we always sing it.

03:12.867 --> 03:16.667
We know-- same old song
with the same old sounds.

03:16.734 --> 03:18.000
Enough already.

03:18.066 --> 03:19.066
Bawk bawk
bawk bawk bawk.

03:19.133 --> 03:23.800
Oh, see what I mean?
They won't sing.

03:23.867 --> 03:25.900
Elmo really wanted to sing

03:25.967 --> 03:27.900
with old MacDonald
and his animals.

03:27.967 --> 03:30.734
- Y yo también.
- Yeah. Me, too.

03:30.800 --> 03:33.400
Well, you can count us out.

03:33.467 --> 03:35.266
Come on. Back to the farm.

03:35.333 --> 03:37.567
Animals:
No more! No more!

03:37.633 --> 03:39.633
- Wait!
- Wait a minute. Wait.

03:39.700 --> 03:42.066
You're just gonna
give up and go home?

03:42.133 --> 03:43.700
Cow: What else can we do?

03:43.767 --> 03:45.533
Well, you could stay,
and we can try

03:45.600 --> 03:47.133
and solve this problem together.

03:47.200 --> 03:50.500
Yeah. We're pretty good
at solving problems around here.

03:50.567 --> 03:51.700
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

03:51.767 --> 03:53.400
- Mm-hmm.

03:55.233 --> 03:58.033
Well, first, we put
our heads together

03:58.100 --> 04:00.633
and think about it,
oh, like this.

04:00.700 --> 04:04.767
Oh, so the sheep,
the cow, and the chicken

04:04.834 --> 04:07.900
don't want to sing
"old MacDonald"
the same old way.

04:07.967 --> 04:11.100
No, so, maybe,
we could try singing it

04:11.166 --> 04:13.166
in a different way.

04:13.233 --> 04:15.967
- Bawk bawk!

04:16.033 --> 04:20.867
- Yes, and I've got an idea.

04:20.934 --> 04:23.500
So you're tired of singing
the same old moo moos

04:23.567 --> 04:25.367
and baa baa sounds, right?

04:25.433 --> 04:26.500
- Mm-hmm.
- Aye.

04:26.567 --> 04:30.934
Well, get ready
for something different.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.900
Magic, magic out of bounds,

04:34.967 --> 04:38.033
give our friends
some different sounds.

04:38.100 --> 04:40.867
Zippety zap. Hmm.

04:42.967 --> 04:44.667
What happened?

04:44.734 --> 04:47.633
Me wee sheep sounds
like a fire engine.

04:49.734 --> 04:53.800
Oh, and the cow sounds
like a car horn.

04:53.867 --> 04:56.700
Whoa, that's
definitely different.

04:56.767 --> 04:58.400
Bawk bawk bawk
bawk bawk.

04:58.467 --> 05:00.200
Well, the chicken
still sounds like a chicken.

05:00.266 --> 05:01.867
I wonder why the spell
didn't work on her.

05:03.300 --> 05:07.000
Oh, Alan sounds
like a choo-choo train.

05:07.066 --> 05:09.033
Bawk Bawk bawk bawk
bawk bawk bawk.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.967
Rosita: Oh, we can't sing
"Old MacDonald"

05:12.033 --> 05:14.400
with all this noise!

05:14.467 --> 05:18.133
- Oh, please.
- OK, OK. Um...

05:18.200 --> 05:20.467
Magic, magic, twinkletoes,

05:20.533 --> 05:22.967
we don't like
the sounds you chose.

05:23.033 --> 05:24.500
Zippety zap!

05:25.900 --> 05:26.800
Did it work?

05:29.433 --> 05:31.433
Oh, no.

05:31.500 --> 05:33.867
Now me sheep sounds
like a telephone.

05:35.700 --> 05:38.266
Oop, and the cow sounds
like a doorbell.

05:38.333 --> 05:40.567
Bawk bawk bawk
bawk bawk bawk bawk.

05:40.633 --> 05:42.867
Chicken still sounds
like a chicken.

05:42.934 --> 05:46.000
Uh-oh. That means--

05:46.066 --> 05:47.834
Alan, speak to me.

05:49.367 --> 05:53.734
Oh, ho ho!
Alan is a cuckoo clock!

05:56.200 --> 05:57.767
Abby, you got
to get everybody back

05:57.834 --> 05:59.100
to their regular voices.

05:59.166 --> 06:01.934
Abby: All right.
I'll try. Uh, hmm...

06:02.000 --> 06:04.400
Magic, magic, we prefer

06:04.467 --> 06:06.734
the voices back
to way they were.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.800
Zippety zap!

06:10.734 --> 06:12.800
Did that work?

06:12.867 --> 06:14.467
- Baa.
- Moo.

06:14.533 --> 06:15.533
Bawk bawk.

06:17.033 --> 06:18.800
MacDonald: Thank goodness.

06:18.867 --> 06:21.633
They're back
to themselves again.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.667
Alan?

06:27.734 --> 06:29.767
Hello-- Yeah. I'm good.

06:31.500 --> 06:33.900
Whew! Well, I guess magic

06:33.967 --> 06:36.066
isn't the way
to solve this problem.

06:36.133 --> 06:39.367
Well, it was nice
of you to try,
though, lassie.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.967
I'm afraid
there's no new way

06:42.033 --> 06:45.066
to sing "Old MacDonald."

06:45.133 --> 06:46.367
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute. What's that--

06:46.433 --> 06:48.166
What's that dinging sound?

06:48.233 --> 06:52.900
Oh, that's just my cowbell.
It rings when I move.

06:52.967 --> 06:54.500
Rosita: Ooh,
makes a cool sound.

06:54.567 --> 06:57.500
- Thank you.
- Yeah, it does.

06:57.567 --> 06:58.567
Well, you know,
the cowbell

06:58.633 --> 07:00.467
is actually
a musical instrument.

07:00.533 --> 07:04.066
Wait. That gives me
an idea. Hang on.

07:04.133 --> 07:05.100
Sheep: Wait. Wait--

07:05.166 --> 07:07.867
What is
a musical instrument?

07:07.934 --> 07:10.367
Oh, it's something you use
to make music with.

07:10.433 --> 07:13.066
That's right, and there are
lots of ways to make music.

07:13.133 --> 07:16.367
You can sing, or you can
play music on an instrument.

07:16.433 --> 07:18.000
Mind if I borrow
your cowbell?

07:18.066 --> 07:20.467
Oh, be my guest.

07:20.533 --> 07:22.600
In Cuba,
where my family's from,

07:22.667 --> 07:27.000
we play the cowbell a lot,
especially in salsa bands.

07:27.066 --> 07:28.133
- Yeah.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.133
You play it
like this.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.100
Ready?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.700
You try it.

07:35.767 --> 07:36.667
Oh.

07:39.100 --> 07:42.033
Oh, this is more fun
than mooing.

07:42.100 --> 07:45.667
I think my cow
has found a new sound.

07:45.734 --> 07:48.533
Ah, is there a musical
instrument I could try?

07:48.600 --> 07:51.533
Claro.
These are bongos.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.066
They're a type of drum
from Cuba.

07:53.133 --> 07:55.633
Hey, we play them
In Mexico, too.

07:55.700 --> 07:57.734
My papi loves the bongos.

07:57.800 --> 07:59.934
Yeah. You tap them
like this.

08:01.300 --> 08:02.266
All right.

08:04.166 --> 08:06.367
Ah, dig that crazy beat.

08:06.433 --> 08:08.300
My sheep's
got rhythm.

08:08.367 --> 08:10.600
Hey, and, uh,
what's this, Nina?

08:10.667 --> 08:11.600
Abby: Yeah. I've never seen

08:11.667 --> 08:14.100
a musical instrument
like this before.

08:14.166 --> 08:15.567
That's a marímbula.

08:15.633 --> 08:17.600
- A marímbula.
- Marímbula.

08:17.667 --> 08:21.500
Yeah. It's from Cuba, too.
You pluck it like this.

08:21.567 --> 08:24.500
- Hey.
- It sounds so beautiful.

08:24.567 --> 08:26.600
Bawk bawk bawk
bawk bawk bawk.

08:26.667 --> 08:29.700
Oh, looks like
the chicken wants
to give it a try.

08:29.767 --> 08:31.000
Bawk bawk bawk bawk.

08:31.066 --> 08:32.967
Here you go.

08:33.033 --> 08:34.800
I'll bet you could
play it with your beak.

08:38.433 --> 08:39.633
Bawk bawk bawk!

08:39.700 --> 08:41.100
Will you look
at that?

08:41.166 --> 08:44.100
Me wee animals
have formed a band.

08:44.166 --> 08:48.967
Hey, old MacDonald
had a band.

08:50.166 --> 08:53.734
Abby: It's a new way
to sing the song. Ha ha!

08:53.800 --> 08:55.100
Ooh, I love it.

08:55.166 --> 08:56.800
Well, what are we waiting for?

to Elmo's world!

20:42.567 --> 20:46.767
Oh, guess what Elmo is
wondering about today.

20:46.834 --> 20:48.934
Wait for it.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.867
Wait for it.

20:50.934 --> 20:53.800
Ah, ha ha ha!

20:53.867 --> 20:55.467
Instruments!

20:55.533 --> 20:57.900
Oh.

20:59.967 --> 21:01.533
Boy--

21:01.600 --> 21:02.934
Ha ha ha!

21:03.000 --> 21:05.500
Boy, Elmo loves instruments

21:05.567 --> 21:07.900
and wants to find
out more about them.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.734
Hey! Let's ask
Elmo's friend, Smartie.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.266
Let's call her together.

21:13.333 --> 21:16.433
Oh, Smartie!

21:17.667 --> 21:20.133
Oh!

21:20.200 --> 21:22.367
Smartie, Smartie,
what is--

21:22.433 --> 21:23.567
What is Smartie doing?

21:23.633 --> 21:25.500
Just marching
to my own beat.

21:25.567 --> 21:28.433
You know why?
'Cause I'm so excited

21:28.500 --> 21:30.200
about musical instruments.

21:30.266 --> 21:32.867
Oh, well,
that's perfect, Smartie,

21:32.934 --> 21:34.734
because Elmo wants
to learn

21:34.800 --> 21:36.600
all about instruments.

21:36.667 --> 21:39.800
Well, what do we do
to learn something new?

21:39.867 --> 21:43.166
- We look it up!
- We look it up!

21:43.233 --> 21:46.066
Searching for instruments now.

21:46.133 --> 21:50.233
Neat. An instrument is
anything you use to make music.

21:50.300 --> 21:53.633
Some instruments you play
with your hands, like piano,

21:53.700 --> 21:56.200
and some instruments you play
with your hands

21:56.266 --> 21:58.934
and your mouth, like a flute.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.834
Sometimes you play
musical instruments

22:00.900 --> 22:02.367
with a special tool.

22:02.433 --> 22:05.734
You need a bow to play a cello.

22:05.800 --> 22:07.500
There are different kinds
of instruments

22:07.567 --> 22:08.900
from all over the world--

22:08.967 --> 22:10.800
taiko drums from japan,

22:10.867 --> 22:13.066
the didgeridoo from Australia.

22:13.133 --> 22:14.734
And if you practice a lot,

22:14.800 --> 22:15.900
you can learn to make

22:15.967 --> 22:18.000
really cool music
with instruments.

22:18.066 --> 22:20.033
Wow! Cool.

22:20.100 --> 22:22.834
Thanks for looking that up
for Elmo, Smartie.

22:22.900 --> 22:25.000
I love leaving
on a high note.

22:25.066 --> 22:26.900
- Ha ha!
- Bye-bye.

22:29.033 --> 22:30.700
Bye!

22:30.767 --> 22:32.333
Thank you, Smartie.

22:32.400 --> 22:34.934
Boy, hearing
all those instruments

22:35.000 --> 22:37.900
gives Elmo an idea.

22:37.967 --> 22:41.133
Hey! Oh.
Let's play a game together.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.433
Yeah! Come on, come on.

22:47.834 --> 22:49.500
Ha ha ha!

22:50.900 --> 22:55.133
Oh, Elmo wonders if we can match
the musical instruments

22:55.200 --> 22:57.000
to the sounds they make.

22:57.066 --> 22:58.700
Are you ready?

22:58.767 --> 23:00.166
Let's play.

23:00.233 --> 23:03.166
Let's listen
to the first instrument.

23:03.233 --> 23:06.700
Is this the right instrument?

23:06.767 --> 23:09.133
Kids:
No, that's a drum.

23:09.200 --> 23:13.033
Hmm. Is that sound a piano?

23:13.100 --> 23:15.333
Kid:
That's it, it's a piano.

23:15.400 --> 23:18.567
You play the keys
of a piano to make music.

23:18.633 --> 23:20.367
Let's play again.

23:20.433 --> 23:23.133
Does this instrument
make that sound?

23:23.200 --> 23:25.934
Kids: No!
Kid: That's a trumpet!

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
How about this?

23:28.066 --> 23:29.734
Kids: Yes!
Kid: You play drums...

23:29.800 --> 23:31.500
with drumsticks.

23:31.567 --> 23:34.500
Cool beat.
Now let's listen again.

23:37.900 --> 23:40.633
- Let's find out.
- Kids: Yes.

23:40.700 --> 23:44.467
Kid: You blow into a trumpet.
That makes music.

23:44.533 --> 23:47.934
Boy, Elmo loves
all the different sounds

23:48.000 --> 23:49.967
that musical instruments
can make.

23:50.033 --> 23:55.066
Hey! That makes
Elmo wonder even more.

23:55.133 --> 23:57.633
Elmo wonders
if Mr. Noodle knows

23:57.700 --> 23:59.734
how to play
a musical instrument.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.433
Let's ask him, OK?

24:01.500 --> 24:04.000
Hey, Mr. Noodle!

24:04.066 --> 24:06.834
Oh! Hi, Mr. Noodle!

24:06.900 --> 24:08.166
Kids: Mr. Noodle!

24:08.233 --> 24:11.767
Elmo: Mr. Noodle,
do you play an instrument?

24:11.834 --> 24:12.867
You do?

24:12.934 --> 24:14.734
Really? Ohh!

24:14.800 --> 24:17.066
Can you show us how to play
an instrument, please?

24:17.133 --> 24:19.734
Kids:
Yeah, play us a song.

24:19.800 --> 24:22.367
Elmo:
Oh, boy. Wait a minute.

24:22.433 --> 24:25.600
Kids:
No, that's not an instrument.

24:25.667 --> 24:28.200
Elmo:
No. Try again, Mr. Noodle.

24:28.266 --> 24:30.900
Where's he going? Whoa!

24:30.967 --> 24:32.567
Kid:
Oh, he's doing it.

24:32.633 --> 24:34.967
He's playing
a musical instrument.

24:35.033 --> 24:38.700
Elmo: That's a lot
of instruments, Mr. Noodle.

24:38.767 --> 24:41.734
You did it, Mr. Noodle!

24:41.800 --> 24:45.400
Elmo thinks you must have
practiced really hard.

24:45.467 --> 24:49.734
Ha ha ha! Yeah.
Great job, Mr. Noodle.

24:49.800 --> 24:50.867
Bye-bye.

24:50.934 --> 24:55.100
Boy, learning new things
makes Elmo so happy,

24:55.166 --> 24:57.734
it makes him want to dance.
