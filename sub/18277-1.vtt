00:23.213 --> 00:25.779
Nixon? Yes.

00:25.879 --> 00:27.780
You remember?

00:27.880 --> 00:29.446
Of course I remember.

00:29.546 --> 00:32.113
That's funny how many people forget.

00:32.213 --> 00:34.879
It wasn't so long ago.

00:34.979 --> 00:36.745
Ten years.

00:39.313 --> 00:42.645
What was happening in
Wetherby ten years ago?

00:45.046 --> 00:48.013
He was a distinguished
member of my own profession.

00:48.113 --> 00:52.345
- What, liar?
- No, not liar. Solicitor.

00:53.213 --> 00:55.947
Well, lawyer. He trained as a lawyer.

00:56.047 --> 00:58.345
Liar or lawyer.

00:58.445 --> 01:00.146
Is there a difference?

01:02.246 --> 01:05.212
I wonder, have we got
time for another drink?

01:07.513 --> 01:10.611
Wouldn't it be marvelous
if Nixon walked in now?

01:12.080 --> 01:13.644
Right now!

01:16.213 --> 01:19.312
You just can't help it.
It would cheer everybody up.

01:21.213 --> 01:24.412
Oh, I can't go on.
Oh, Stanley.

01:26.813 --> 01:29.713
Oh, we've lived in this
town for too long.

01:29.813 --> 01:31.512
Aye.

01:37.379 --> 01:38.780
Time, gentlemen, please.

01:38.880 --> 01:41.446
I'll tell you the best
thing about Nixon.

01:41.546 --> 01:43.779
Shouldn't you be getting
back to school?

01:43.879 --> 01:45.113
No. No, listen.

01:45.213 --> 01:48.512
I'll tell you the one story
about Nixon. All right?

01:48.612 --> 01:51.947
When he first met pat,
she didn't like him very much.

01:52.047 --> 01:55.846
So, after a bit, she said she
didn't want to see him anymore.

01:55.946 --> 01:58.679
"well," he said,
"it breaks my heart, pat.

01:58.779 --> 02:01.846
I'll only stop seeing you on one
condition." "what's that?" she said.

02:01.946 --> 02:04.213
"that I can always be the chauffeur".

02:04.313 --> 02:07.946
When she went out with men, say,
to the cinema, he'd drive them.

02:08.045 --> 02:10.645
He'd drive them all the
way to the cinema.

02:10.746 --> 02:14.445
They'd go in, her and her date,
and he'd wait outside.

02:14.545 --> 02:18.046
He'd wait outside
during the whole film.

02:19.613 --> 02:23.913
With a packet of popcorn
or a piece of chewing gum.

02:24.013 --> 02:27.945
And then they'd come out,
and he'd drive them home.

02:32.379 --> 02:35.912
I ask you, what does that
tell you about Nixon?

02:37.279 --> 02:41.845
Jean, I ask you, what does
that tell you about pat?

02:59.779 --> 03:03.612
If you want to be loved in life,

03:03.712 --> 03:05.513
There's no use in having opinions.

03:05.613 --> 03:07.213
I think you're right.

03:07.313 --> 03:10.379
People who get loved are easy.
Easy to get along with.

03:10.479 --> 03:12.113
Jean.

03:12.213 --> 03:16.012
Have we lost the corkscrew?
I can't do the bloody thing!

03:18.312 --> 03:21.946
There's a new girl
at work, at the library.

03:22.046 --> 03:25.512
The sort of girl men fall for.
Vacant.

03:25.612 --> 03:27.113
Cool?

03:27.213 --> 03:29.279
Yeah, distant.
That's right.

03:29.379 --> 03:31.779
She doesn't really
have a personality.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.278
She just has a way
of suggesting to men

03:34.378 --> 03:37.013
That she'll be whatever
they want her to be.

03:37.113 --> 03:39.446
Not a person.
Not a real person.

03:39.546 --> 03:41.813
What's she done, this girl?
Well, I'll tell you...

03:41.913 --> 03:45.712
Just being this thing you object to,
or has she done anything wrong?

03:45.812 --> 03:47.147
She exists.
She's young?

03:47.247 --> 03:49.147
Yes, if you like.
She's young. So w...

03:49.247 --> 03:51.046
It's an offense.

03:51.146 --> 03:54.579
But there's no her!
There's nothing which is her!

03:56.446 --> 04:00.879
I look at the young,
truly, and I'm mystified.

04:00.979 --> 04:04.846
They want nothing. They need nothing.
They have no ambition.

04:04.946 --> 04:08.445
Get married, have children,
get a mortgage.

04:10.246 --> 04:13.146
A hundred thousand years
of human evolution.

04:15.712 --> 04:18.113
Brontosaurus, tyrannosaurus, man.

04:18.213 --> 04:20.546
And the sum ambition?

04:20.646 --> 04:23.779
Two up, two down in the
west riding of Yorkshire

04:23.879 --> 04:27.546
On a custom-built
estate of brick and glass.

04:27.646 --> 04:29.612
That's not right. Is it?

04:30.712 --> 04:32.512
Well, can anyone tell me?

04:32.612 --> 04:37.278
She's young. That's all
you're saying. She's young.

04:50.679 --> 04:53.479
I think it's fixed.
Thank you.

04:53.579 --> 04:56.779
A slate fell off in the
middle of the night.

04:56.879 --> 05:00.512
I was frightened to go up.
It's all right.

05:00.612 --> 05:02.945
Shall we go down?

05:10.279 --> 05:13.178
I knew you'd say that.
I knew you would.

05:13.546 --> 05:14.812
Lethal.

05:14.912 --> 05:18.179
It wasn't Heath Phelps.

05:18.279 --> 05:20.013
It was!
No, no, no.

05:20.113 --> 05:23.179
It was. Don't you remember
the size of the hailstones?

05:23.279 --> 05:26.746
There weren't any hailstones, Stanley.
Don't be ridiculous.

05:26.846 --> 05:30.945
Yes, it was! It was pissing
with rain! Ah, coffee.

05:33.113 --> 05:35.679
Whether our faces show.
This is the question.

05:35.779 --> 05:38.513
We read a face.
We look into a face.

05:38.613 --> 05:42.445
Into that face all sorts of
things we claim to read.

05:45.513 --> 05:47.345
Mary here.

05:48.345 --> 05:50.078
Or John.

05:51.546 --> 05:53.413
John's got a sly face.

05:53.513 --> 05:56.078
He has, too.
He has got a sly face.

05:56.178 --> 05:57.646
He's got sly features.

05:57.746 --> 05:59.679
Is John a sly boy?

05:59.779 --> 06:02.479
He's sly, all right.
Right.

06:02.579 --> 06:05.045
Do we become the way we look?

06:05.145 --> 06:08.412
Or do we look the way we really are?

06:12.479 --> 06:15.578
"if thou hast eyes to see..."

06:24.212 --> 06:27.112
It's about the play.
Will you be needing me?

06:27.212 --> 06:30.579
I'll be needing you, all right.
Will you do it? I should think so.

06:39.880 --> 06:41.279
Good day, miss.

06:41.379 --> 06:43.279
See you.

06:43.379 --> 06:45.746
Miss Travers, I was wondering,

06:45.846 --> 06:48.278
Do you have time for a chat?

07:05.346 --> 07:08.412
Miss Travers, do you
think there's any point

07:08.512 --> 07:10.579
In my going on in the sixth form?

07:10.679 --> 07:14.112
Of course. Don't be silly.
What makes you say that?

07:14.212 --> 07:17.012
It's just that everyone
seems to end up unemployed.

07:17.112 --> 07:19.012
Not everyone.

07:19.112 --> 07:21.779
But, um, I do know what you mean.

07:21.879 --> 07:26.046
You get a university degree,
like in french. Then what?

07:26.146 --> 07:30.146
Maybe you get to be a secretary,
and that's if you're lucky.

07:30.246 --> 07:32.145
Honestly, I've really
thought about it,

07:32.245 --> 07:35.613
And I don't really think
it's worth it, you see.

07:35.713 --> 07:37.712
That's not what
education is, though, Suzie.

07:37.812 --> 07:40.646
If you're thinking, "I must
use education for a career,"

07:40.746 --> 07:44.446
Then you're already thinking of
education... In the wrong way.

07:44.546 --> 07:46.779
Education...
Is a thing in itself.

07:46.879 --> 07:49.479
It's a way of fulfilling
your potential,

07:49.579 --> 07:52.813
Looking for ways of
thinking about things...

07:52.913 --> 07:54.746
Ways which, if you're lucky,

07:54.846 --> 07:57.513
Will help not just your career,
but your whole life.

07:57.613 --> 07:59.311
What ways?

08:02.245 --> 08:03.911
Well...

08:06.512 --> 08:08.346
Ways of being
more ordered, I suppose,

08:08.446 --> 08:12.012
Of having more discipline
in the way you think.

08:12.112 --> 08:14.012
Not always being bullheaded,

08:14.112 --> 08:16.079
Learning not to rush into things.

08:16.179 --> 08:18.313
Do you think uneducated
people do that?

08:18.413 --> 08:20.712
Well, I don't. No.

08:20.812 --> 08:22.713
Not necessarily.

08:22.813 --> 08:24.712
I mean...

08:24.812 --> 08:26.679
Sometimes.

08:26.779 --> 08:29.613
Are they inferior for not
knowing how to think?

08:29.713 --> 08:32.511
No. Of course not.

08:32.611 --> 08:34.413
But if you have something...

08:34.513 --> 08:37.979
What you call a way of
thinking... which they don't,

08:38.078 --> 08:41.011
Surely you're saying you're superior.

08:41.111 --> 08:44.346
No, Suzie.
I wouldn't say that.

08:44.446 --> 08:46.178
What, then?

08:46.278 --> 08:47.646
Different.

08:47.746 --> 08:50.545
Better or worse?

09:02.045 --> 09:03.978
I brought you some pheasants.

09:05.379 --> 09:07.311
Am I disturbing you?

09:26.012 --> 09:28.278
Well, I'll make some tea.

10:08.945 --> 10:12.645
I love the slow evenings,
when summer begins to come.

10:13.846 --> 10:16.611
It doesn't get dark until 8:00.

10:35.978 --> 10:38.077
Are you staying long with Marcie?

10:39.945 --> 10:42.045
No.

10:42.145 --> 10:44.212
I don't know Marcie.

10:44.312 --> 10:45.545
What?

10:45.645 --> 10:47.045
But you said...

10:47.145 --> 10:48.546
What?

10:48.646 --> 10:52.045
When you came to dinner.
I met her on the doorstep.

10:52.145 --> 10:53.879
I thought...

10:53.979 --> 10:55.845
Who invited you?

10:55.945 --> 10:57.812
No one.

10:59.680 --> 11:01.379
Are you saying...

11:01.479 --> 11:04.446
it's not possible.
Are you saying...

11:04.546 --> 11:07.046
I met Marcie on the doorstep.

11:07.146 --> 11:09.046
I introduced myself.

11:09.146 --> 11:10.979
I thought you came with her.

11:11.079 --> 11:12.412
No.

11:12.512 --> 11:15.045
It's not possible.

11:15.145 --> 11:17.178
Then I said John Morgan,
if you remember.

11:17.278 --> 11:18.845
Yes.
And you shook my hand.

11:18.945 --> 11:20.612
Come on.

11:20.712 --> 11:23.446
Come in, come in.
The more, the merrier.

11:23.546 --> 11:26.244
And you accepted me.

11:33.945 --> 11:36.346
I'll lay an extra place.

11:36.446 --> 11:38.513
Thank you.

11:38.613 --> 11:41.945
It's absurd. It's impossible.

11:42.045 --> 11:43.978
No.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.345
No!

11:54.445 --> 11:55.413
No!

11:55.513 --> 11:57.778
Yes! Yes!

11:57.878 --> 12:00.279
No.
Yes!

12:00.379 --> 12:02.446
Don't you mean yes?

12:02.546 --> 12:04.911
I mean yes! Yes!

12:30.646 --> 12:32.546
Let me see.

12:32.646 --> 12:34.579
Let me look at you.

12:55.812 --> 12:58.212
You're not meant to.

12:58.312 --> 13:00.078
I know.

13:02.479 --> 13:05.379
Do you fly these?
Not a chance.

13:05.479 --> 13:07.546
Engine fitters don't get to fly.

13:07.646 --> 13:10.546
It's three years before you
get to go on a flying course.

13:10.646 --> 13:13.513
Longer, maybe,
and then not one of these.

13:13.613 --> 13:17.246
Really? They take the troops
out in these... To the jungle.

13:17.346 --> 13:19.745
Oh!
To the war.

13:19.845 --> 13:23.145
You come down seven times
before you get to Malaya.

13:23.245 --> 13:25.145
It takes over a week.

13:25.245 --> 13:29.578
By the time you get there, you know
you've been traveling. I'm sure.

13:31.045 --> 13:34.012
Did you realize you might have
to fight when you joined?

13:34.112 --> 13:35.946
You're an airman, you want to fly.

13:36.046 --> 13:38.279
You're a soldier, you want to fight.

13:38.379 --> 13:40.645
Not much point else.

13:40.745 --> 13:42.378
No.

13:57.112 --> 13:59.044
I'll walk you home.

14:19.112 --> 14:22.211
Happen if I were killed,
I'd still say fine.

14:23.712 --> 14:26.712
I joined to fight.
Didn't have to.

14:26.812 --> 14:29.012
Could just have done
national service,

14:29.112 --> 14:31.712
Tramped the parade ground.

14:31.812 --> 14:34.045
We're not even at war.

14:34.145 --> 14:37.212
Well, not properly at war.

14:37.312 --> 14:39.213
Half a war.

14:39.313 --> 14:41.244
Malaya's half a war.

14:43.612 --> 14:45.545
But I liked the idea.

14:50.445 --> 14:52.445
Is your mum in bed?

14:52.545 --> 14:54.311
I think so.

14:59.313 --> 15:02.811
If she ever asks,
we saw the third man.

15:27.146 --> 15:29.112
Jean?

15:29.212 --> 15:30.346
Still awake?

15:30.446 --> 15:32.478
Yes. How was it?

15:32.578 --> 15:34.512
Good.

15:43.412 --> 15:46.045
Orson wells killed
all these children,

15:46.145 --> 15:48.478
Then they shot him
in a sewer in the end.

15:48.578 --> 15:49.846
That's good.

15:49.946 --> 15:51.945
Yes.

15:52.045 --> 15:54.144
Good night.

15:59.711 --> 16:02.212
Never dreamt...

16:02.312 --> 16:06.346
Never thought any such
happiness possible.

16:06.446 --> 16:09.712
Hiding in the dark.

16:09.812 --> 16:12.744
Loving a man in the dark.

16:17.379 --> 16:21.078
Never knew any such
happiness possible at all.

16:43.145 --> 16:45.245
How bad is it?

17:16.645 --> 17:18.778
Why did he do it?

17:18.877 --> 17:22.012
Depressed, I suppose.

17:22.112 --> 17:25.044
So why did he do it in here?

17:36.312 --> 17:38.411
I love the warm evenings.

17:40.711 --> 17:43.344
Something.

17:43.444 --> 17:45.477
Tea?

17:46.779 --> 17:49.711
Doesn't get dark till eight.

18:06.778 --> 18:09.245
How long are you staying with Marcia?

18:09.345 --> 18:11.745
I'm not.

18:11.845 --> 18:13.912
Shock.

18:14.012 --> 18:16.178
Moves towards him.

18:18.245 --> 18:20.478
What do you mean?

18:20.578 --> 18:23.445
He explains.

18:23.545 --> 18:26.545
Unbelievable.

18:26.645 --> 18:29.078
Right pocket.

18:41.179 --> 18:43.111
That's it.

19:53.377 --> 19:55.211
There seems little point...

19:55.679 --> 19:56.712
Ah!

19:56.812 --> 19:59.112
My goodness!
I'm sorry, you startled me.

19:59.212 --> 20:01.879
New lock?

20:01.979 --> 20:04.911
The chances of the same
thing happening again...

20:06.511 --> 20:09.245
Anyway, I let him in.

20:09.345 --> 20:13.745
Well, it doesn't matter
how well you're locked up.

20:13.845 --> 20:17.777
At times you're always going
to have to let people in.

20:26.112 --> 20:28.012
Are you all right?

20:28.112 --> 20:29.745
Yes.

20:29.845 --> 20:32.912
I've been trying to sleep,
as best I may.

20:33.012 --> 20:35.745
Yes, I'm sorry.
We don't clean up afterwards.

20:35.845 --> 20:38.744
We just take the body away.

20:39.978 --> 20:42.045
It seems a bit callous, I know.

20:42.145 --> 20:45.378
But the thinking is...
That if we always had to clear up,

20:45.478 --> 20:49.011
The police would spend their
entire life on their knees.

20:51.378 --> 20:53.278
How are you getting on?

20:53.378 --> 20:57.278
Well, we have something.
He was a student.

20:57.378 --> 20:59.278
I see.

20:59.378 --> 21:01.846
Yes. He was working for his doctorate

21:01.946 --> 21:03.678
At the university of Essex.

21:03.778 --> 21:07.177
He came to the town a few
days ago and rented a room.

21:07.277 --> 21:09.411
Are you a graduate yourself?

21:09.511 --> 21:13.311
Yes. A subject of much mirth.
A graduate policeman.

21:13.411 --> 21:16.278
This man wasn't my generation.
He was younger.

21:16.378 --> 21:18.578
He was only 25.

21:18.678 --> 21:22.678
He came to research at the
British library down the road.

21:22.778 --> 21:24.877
A blankness.

21:27.079 --> 21:29.978
A central, disfiguring blankness.

21:30.078 --> 21:32.844
That's what people who
knew him describe.

21:34.812 --> 21:36.744
Yes, it's true.

21:41.078 --> 21:43.178
I've been trying to remember.

21:45.278 --> 21:49.377
He said so little at dinner,
until late in the evening.

21:51.578 --> 21:54.510
He s-seemed already set on a path.

21:59.978 --> 22:02.445
It's funny.
I mean, looking back,

22:02.545 --> 22:05.111
I took it for granted
that he was there.

22:05.211 --> 22:06.445
Yes. Well, that's right.

22:06.545 --> 22:08.878
I mean, I've often
been out to dinner,

22:08.978 --> 22:11.345
And not been quite
sure who somebody was.

22:11.445 --> 22:13.045
No.

22:13.145 --> 22:14.577
Quite.

22:17.045 --> 22:20.310
Though, usually, it is different
if you're the hostess.

22:22.979 --> 22:26.712
Anyway, it turns out it wasn't
completely out of the blue.

22:26.812 --> 22:29.711
Um, the day before,
he'd seen Marcia Pilborough.

22:29.811 --> 22:32.846
As you know, she works
at the library. Oh, I see.

22:32.946 --> 22:36.245
And he'd, um, gone up to her.
They'd had a conversation.

22:36.345 --> 22:38.611
He wanted to borrow a book.

22:38.711 --> 22:40.845
Afterwards, we think,
he probably waited

22:40.945 --> 22:42.877
And started to follow her.

22:44.945 --> 22:48.845
Oh, well, I see.
It's beginning to make sense.

22:48.945 --> 22:51.244
Well, would-would you say...

22:51.344 --> 22:54.478
I'm sorry. I know these
things are very difficult,

22:54.578 --> 22:57.878
But would you say that
Marcia was, in any way,

22:57.978 --> 23:01.244
A woman who was
likely to have been...

23:01.344 --> 23:03.345
Deliberately provocative?

23:03.445 --> 23:08.845
Look. I mean, is lying,
and brought him to dinner...

23:08.945 --> 23:12.077
Deliberately, or as a joke?

23:12.177 --> 23:13.745
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:13.845 --> 23:17.411
I don't mean to be rude,
but Marcia's my best friend.

23:17.511 --> 23:20.644
I don't think that would
be possible at all.

23:24.779 --> 23:27.845
He said I'm the best
builder in Wetherby.

23:27.945 --> 23:30.845
He said that.

23:30.945 --> 23:33.845
I knew you'd like it.

23:33.945 --> 23:36.044
When did you take it?

23:36.144 --> 23:40.445
And he said to me...
He said he'd come around...

23:40.545 --> 23:44.512
Look everyone.
Look what Marcia's brought me.

23:44.612 --> 23:46.712
A picture of my house.
Lovely.

23:46.812 --> 23:48.011
Do you like it?

23:48.111 --> 23:50.143
Clever girl. Hmm.

23:52.378 --> 23:54.478
It's great.

23:54.578 --> 23:56.844
Jim...

24:02.578 --> 24:06.244
Jim, no. Don't, for goodness sake.

24:06.344 --> 24:08.245
Goodness.

24:08.345 --> 24:10.277
Is this a party wall?

24:14.745 --> 24:16.145
Jim?

24:16.245 --> 24:17.745
What?

24:17.845 --> 24:19.912
Please. It's undignified.

24:20.012 --> 24:21.745
Unladylike.

24:21.845 --> 24:23.777
Yes.

24:32.077 --> 24:34.011
Jim! Oh, lord, it's my mother.

24:34.111 --> 24:35.678
What?

24:35.778 --> 24:37.710
Let me down.

24:45.745 --> 24:48.478
I want to make love to you.

24:48.578 --> 24:50.510
Jim.

25:05.811 --> 25:08.045
Jean, are you home?

25:08.145 --> 25:10.077
I'm home.

25:11.378 --> 25:13.445
Is there anything you need?

25:13.545 --> 25:16.144
No. No, I'm fine.

26:38.044 --> 26:40.944
Do you know how long
you'll be staying?

26:41.044 --> 26:43.643
Uh, just a couple of days.

28:00.944 --> 28:03.078
Oh, well done, Stanley.

28:03.178 --> 28:04.843
Thanks.

28:06.811 --> 28:08.877
Jean?

28:08.977 --> 28:10.944
We brought you some breakfast.

28:11.044 --> 28:13.610
Thank you, Marcia.
I'm just coming down.

28:16.877 --> 28:20.011
Take the paper, Stanley.
Hide it.

28:20.111 --> 28:22.109
We've got you bacon and eggs!

28:23.545 --> 28:27.312
Why hide it? I thought she
was there when it happened.

28:27.412 --> 28:30.611
Well, she doesn't want to
be reminded. Would you?

28:34.578 --> 28:36.511
Good morning.

28:38.111 --> 28:41.210
No paper, I'm afraid.
I think there's a strike.

28:44.311 --> 28:46.111
All right?

28:46.211 --> 28:48.378
Well, I'm not in the pink.

28:48.478 --> 28:49.944
Oh, I shouldn't wonder.

28:50.044 --> 28:51.278
Did you sleep?

28:51.378 --> 28:53.310
I had dreams.

28:55.044 --> 28:57.645
Does anyone know why he did it?

28:57.745 --> 29:01.877
And why on earth should he come
and choose to do it to you?

29:01.977 --> 29:04.645
It was me who met him first.

29:04.745 --> 29:08.777
I don't know why I didn't
think of it at the dinner.

29:08.877 --> 29:12.545
I'd met him already.
He could have done it to me.

29:12.645 --> 29:14.811
I think the lonely
recognize the lonely.

29:14.911 --> 29:17.212
Well, you're not lonely.

29:17.312 --> 29:19.211
I only want coffee.

29:19.311 --> 29:22.345
Stan, do you mind? Would you
go and do something useful?

29:22.445 --> 29:25.776
Do you know how to
do it with a filter?

29:51.678 --> 29:54.579
Well, have you searched
back over all your behavior?

29:54.679 --> 29:58.578
Did you offend him in any way?
That's what I've been thinking.

29:58.678 --> 30:01.078
Or perhaps we upset him.

30:01.178 --> 30:03.811
Perhaps you looked like his mother.

30:03.911 --> 30:06.845
No, it is possible.
I read in a book.

30:06.945 --> 30:09.278
No, I think it was
more what we shared.

30:09.378 --> 30:10.944
What's that?

30:11.044 --> 30:14.512
I told you.
A feeling for solitude.

30:14.612 --> 30:18.777
Well, you may have thought that,
but to shoot your head off...

30:18.877 --> 30:21.844
Oh, please.
Marcia, the bacon's too much.

30:21.944 --> 30:24.245
Oh, god. Oh, it
hadn't occurred to me.

30:24.345 --> 30:26.478
I'm sorry, Jean. I...
I just didn't think.

30:26.578 --> 30:28.777
I'll take it out.
Oh Jean, I'm sorry.

30:28.877 --> 30:31.377
It's out.
It's almost out.

30:48.977 --> 30:53.044
If you're frightened of
loneliness, never get married.

30:53.144 --> 30:56.077
I'm not frightened.
I'm hardened by now.

31:03.711 --> 31:06.210
Come in, come in.

31:12.579 --> 31:14.744
Nice to meet you.

31:14.844 --> 31:16.245
This is Jean.

31:16.345 --> 31:18.577
Mrs. Mortimer.

31:18.677 --> 31:21.611
And this is Jim's father. Hello.

31:21.711 --> 31:24.944
Please, sit down, sit down.

31:25.044 --> 31:28.945
I've baked you some scones,
and there's Battenburg cake.

31:29.045 --> 31:30.378
You're looking very thin, lad.

31:30.478 --> 31:32.410
Nay, I've... I've been fine.

31:34.678 --> 31:37.211
And so you'd be giving
up college, then?

31:37.311 --> 31:39.445
No, I don't think so, Mr. Mortimer.

31:39.545 --> 31:40.877
Ah.

31:40.977 --> 31:44.677
Jim thought as he'd be away
for so long and so often,

31:44.777 --> 31:46.711
It's better if I occupy myself.

31:46.811 --> 31:50.778
I think I have a place at
the university of hull.

31:50.878 --> 31:52.643
Are you sure?

31:54.311 --> 31:57.710
You don't think a woman
who's going to get married

31:57.810 --> 32:00.278
Should be thinking of going
off away from her home.

32:00.378 --> 32:03.144
But Jim won't be there.
He'll be in Malaya.

32:03.244 --> 32:05.644
He'll want to know
you're where you belong.

32:05.744 --> 32:09.044
What difference would it
make if he'd not be with me?

32:09.144 --> 32:11.010
He'll want to know you're at home.

32:14.844 --> 32:17.412
I can't honestly see it'd
make any difference.

32:17.512 --> 32:21.610
Any home life we have is bound
to be interrupted at the start.

32:21.710 --> 32:23.911
We'll see each other
so little for a bit.

32:24.011 --> 32:26.078
Seven years?
Is that right?

32:26.178 --> 32:27.710
Well, not necessarily.

32:27.810 --> 32:29.243
Doesn't Jim speak?

32:32.412 --> 32:35.644
The air force will
give me a house later,

32:35.744 --> 32:38.011
When I'm back from active service.

32:38.111 --> 32:41.876
For now it's nice if Jean
goes on with her books.

32:52.978 --> 32:54.877
More Battenburg?

32:54.977 --> 32:56.878
Did you bake it yourself?

32:56.978 --> 32:58.743
Don't be daft.

33:01.311 --> 33:03.211
You shouldn't worry.

33:03.311 --> 33:05.211
They made me feel stupid.

33:05.311 --> 33:06.710
Why?

33:06.810 --> 33:09.378
Perhaps it is silly.
Impractical.

33:09.478 --> 33:11.977
Well, we're always so happy together.

33:12.077 --> 33:15.844
It never occurs to us there's
a world of people out there.

33:15.944 --> 33:20.043
We can't spend our life with
the sheets up over our heads.

33:21.110 --> 33:23.278
How can you make Battenburg?

33:23.378 --> 33:26.211
No one can make Battenburg.

33:26.311 --> 33:28.477
Half of it's pink!

33:28.577 --> 33:31.311
Jim, I know. I was
frightened, that's all.

33:31.411 --> 33:33.344
You know nothing.

33:57.311 --> 33:59.711
The angle...
Yeah.

33:59.811 --> 34:03.311
Of the body means murder
is probably discounted.

34:05.311 --> 34:09.510
There's forensic
evidence, fingerprints.

34:09.610 --> 34:11.543
Nobody else touched the gun.

34:13.844 --> 34:17.442
At the inquest, I shall
be arguing it's suicide.

34:19.643 --> 34:21.543
You look disappointed.

34:21.643 --> 34:23.576
No. Not at all.

34:26.677 --> 34:27.976
Where is it?

34:28.077 --> 34:30.409
Derby.
That's where he came from.

34:30.510 --> 34:32.911
All right.
Lads need the space.

34:33.011 --> 34:34.344
New fire hose demonstration.

34:34.444 --> 34:36.145
Not in here, for Christ's sake.

34:36.245 --> 34:38.277
Not real fire hoses, idiot.

34:38.378 --> 34:40.377
Slide show.

34:40.476 --> 34:42.877
No problem, all right?

34:42.976 --> 34:45.909
Stick your thumb up
your bum for a bit.

34:48.110 --> 34:50.643
Do fuck-all anyway.

34:52.911 --> 34:55.311
Hey mike, look at this.
What is it?

34:55.411 --> 34:58.111
Famous people without their
clothes on. Celebrity nudes.

34:58.211 --> 35:00.811
Jesus, look at her.
Sergeant, what do you mean?

35:00.911 --> 35:03.477
Celebrity nudes here, look.
It's Jackie Kennedy.

35:03.577 --> 35:05.911
Jackie Kennedy.

35:06.011 --> 35:07.744
All women?

35:07.844 --> 35:09.011
Yup.
No men?

35:09.111 --> 35:11.678
Hey, isn't that suppose
to be, um, Britt Ekland?

35:11.778 --> 35:15.811
It's a bit of a bad likeness.
He must have been in the bushes.

35:15.911 --> 35:19.643
No. Men'd be taking the joke
much too far, wouldn't it?

35:20.710 --> 35:22.711
It's cilla black.

35:22.811 --> 35:24.778
You don't need to take flowers.

35:24.878 --> 35:26.945
I can't explain it.

35:27.045 --> 35:29.143
I just thought I would.

35:34.711 --> 35:36.610
Jean, I'm sorry.

35:36.710 --> 35:39.310
I was just settling your class.
We weren't expecting you.

35:39.410 --> 35:41.744
I thought I'd feel
better if I came in.

35:41.844 --> 35:44.677
I gave them some books
and told them to shut up.

35:44.777 --> 35:47.044
Hmm. Good.

35:47.144 --> 35:50.344
Well, uh... You must
come around to dinner.

35:50.444 --> 35:52.344
Yes. I'd like to.

35:52.444 --> 35:54.078
I... I mean, uh...

35:54.178 --> 35:57.943
We must have you back.
We don't see enough of you.

36:00.777 --> 36:02.542
Bye.

36:06.610 --> 36:09.777
Right. Come on.
Heads out of the books.

36:09.877 --> 36:12.778
Please everyone, that's not
how I teach, as you know.

36:12.878 --> 36:15.944
Mr. Braithwaite said you weren't
going to be here today, miss.

36:16.044 --> 36:18.911
You have a pleasant surprise.
Board please, Marjorie.

36:19.011 --> 36:21.343
Please, miss, I forgot
to hand in my book.

36:21.443 --> 36:24.110
Shut up. Sit down.
Open a window.

36:28.245 --> 36:31.676
Uh, miss, you've still got
your fag in your mouth.

36:40.443 --> 36:42.476
Good.

36:52.511 --> 36:54.410
Right. Today...

36:54.510 --> 36:56.944
We address ourselves to the question,

36:57.044 --> 37:01.976
Is Shakespeare worth reading
although it's only about kings?

37:40.477 --> 37:42.377
Hello.

37:42.477 --> 37:45.044
Sorry. I don't mean to surprise you.

37:45.144 --> 37:46.710
It's all right.

37:46.810 --> 37:48.509
I should have rung.

37:51.211 --> 37:55.144
I've come from the funeral.
I'm a friend of John Morgan's.

38:05.610 --> 38:07.542
Come in.

38:12.877 --> 38:16.610
I had a kind of inkling he
might do something silly.

38:16.710 --> 38:19.377
I always thought he was weird.

38:19.477 --> 38:22.310
Were you at the same university?

38:22.410 --> 38:25.744
He was post-graduate.
I'm just a first-year.

38:25.844 --> 38:29.577
Had you...
Been going out with him?

38:29.677 --> 38:31.577
No. I never slept with him.

38:31.677 --> 38:34.411
Went to the cinema twice.

38:34.511 --> 38:36.977
Seen that film about the Indian.

38:37.077 --> 38:38.443
Gandhi?

38:38.611 --> 38:41.011
That's right.

38:41.111 --> 38:43.744
Afterwards, he couldn't stop talking.

38:43.844 --> 38:46.577
He thought this and he thought that.

38:46.677 --> 38:50.177
The philosophy of
nonviolence and so on.

38:50.277 --> 38:53.176
And I really didn't think anything.

38:53.276 --> 38:56.043
Except that, obviously,
the film was very long.

38:57.744 --> 39:00.409
In that way, we weren't even suited.

39:01.744 --> 39:04.477
I think he was trying to impress me.

39:04.577 --> 39:06.676
He chose the wrong way.

39:08.577 --> 39:10.978
I like people who are
just themselves.

39:11.078 --> 39:13.743
Not talking rubbish all the time.

39:16.811 --> 39:21.077
I know I shouldn't say that
about anyone who's dead, but...

39:21.177 --> 39:24.077
Anyone who did what
they did to you...

39:25.844 --> 39:29.343
He certainly upset me.

39:29.443 --> 39:31.977
Yes. I can tell.

39:34.344 --> 39:36.544
Then he started to pester me.

39:36.644 --> 39:41.544
I had to go to his professor
to ask him to stop watching me.

39:41.644 --> 39:44.242
The worst was in the laundrette.

39:48.277 --> 39:51.844
I think it was me he
wanted to do it to.

39:51.944 --> 39:55.376
And just by bad luck,
he did it to you.

40:15.343 --> 40:17.644
Are you going back?

40:17.744 --> 40:18.845
When?
This evening.

40:18.945 --> 40:21.376
I don't really have any plan.

40:22.610 --> 40:24.844
I only came up on an impulse.

40:24.944 --> 40:28.176
Then a policeman at the
funeral gave me a lift.

40:28.276 --> 40:29.844
Who was that?

40:29.944 --> 40:31.810
He was called Langdon.

40:42.511 --> 40:45.210
I'd never have thought of it.

40:45.310 --> 40:48.044
It was his idea I should come.

41:17.577 --> 41:20.710
So how long had you known him?

41:20.810 --> 41:23.044
Who?
John Morgan.

41:23.144 --> 41:25.043
Oh, him.

41:25.143 --> 41:27.076
I don't know.

41:30.611 --> 41:32.511
Do you have a television?

41:32.611 --> 41:35.876
Yes. I've got one.
It's behind the chair.

41:37.710 --> 41:39.544
I hardly ever watch it.

41:39.644 --> 41:41.244
I watch it most evenings.

41:41.344 --> 41:43.277
At university?

41:43.377 --> 41:46.010
They have a room you can sit in.

41:46.110 --> 41:48.876
Do you mind if I get it out?

41:52.744 --> 41:56.477
I held a very important position.

41:56.577 --> 42:00.009
Pull yourself together,
for god's sake.

42:27.043 --> 42:29.943
I've finished in the bathroom.

42:30.043 --> 42:31.976
Good night.

42:44.711 --> 42:46.910
How was the funeral?

42:47.010 --> 42:49.010
Ghastly.

42:49.110 --> 42:51.009
I had to go to derby.

42:52.544 --> 42:54.476
And it started to rain.

42:56.344 --> 42:59.244
There's only his mother left alive.

42:59.344 --> 43:03.244
She had no idea why he'd done it.

43:03.344 --> 43:06.175
Seems as if neither do you.

43:08.110 --> 43:10.010
Have you been riding?

43:10.110 --> 43:13.477
Hmm. That's why I fell asleep.

43:13.577 --> 43:15.976
We broke in a new horse.

43:16.076 --> 43:18.309
So, I'm saddle-sore.

43:23.443 --> 43:25.910
The problem is...

43:26.010 --> 43:29.244
No crime has been committed.

43:29.344 --> 43:33.510
Killing yourself is legal,
even in front of somebody else.

43:34.977 --> 43:37.210
Hmm.

43:37.310 --> 43:40.877
Unless she did something
to provoke him.

43:40.977 --> 43:42.576
Yes.

43:47.811 --> 43:50.577
She'd only known him 24 hours.

43:50.677 --> 43:54.144
She is...

43:54.244 --> 43:56.010
What?

43:56.110 --> 44:00.744
A teacher, obviously good at her job.

44:00.844 --> 44:04.377
Loved by her pupils.

44:04.477 --> 44:06.909
Did she teach you?

44:07.077 --> 44:09.744
No. But I remember her.

44:09.844 --> 44:11.744
She was nice.

44:11.844 --> 44:15.243
A good woman...
Chosen, for some reason,

44:15.343 --> 44:19.243
As the victim of the
ultimate practical joke.

44:19.343 --> 44:22.343
I told Stanley not to get drunk.

44:22.443 --> 44:24.243
It's true, it's true.

44:24.343 --> 44:27.809
I don't watch that.
I watch that thing on Sundays.

44:27.909 --> 44:30.010
Hello, Verity.
Hello, darling.

44:30.110 --> 44:31.544
Roger won't watch it

44:31.644 --> 44:34.377
Because he says it's full
of jokes about blacks.

44:34.477 --> 44:35.977
No. I didn't say that.

44:36.077 --> 44:39.076
It's just that particular
kind of joke about blacks.

44:39.176 --> 44:41.743
Hello, Stanley.

44:41.843 --> 44:44.442
Oop! I need some more wine.

44:46.277 --> 44:47.743
Ta-da.

44:47.843 --> 44:50.611
Oh. No, red, it's for cooking.

44:50.711 --> 44:52.043
Well, you're wrong.

44:52.143 --> 44:55.643
I think if they want to
be accepted as British,

44:55.743 --> 44:58.644
Then they'll have to put up
with the fact that they will

44:58.744 --> 45:02.110
Be the butt of peoples' humor...
Just like mothers-in-law.

45:02.210 --> 45:04.411
Do you know who that bloke is?

45:04.511 --> 45:07.710
Stanley, don't be rude.
He's a friend of Jean's.

45:09.110 --> 45:11.444
Here we are.
Stan, will you open this?

45:11.544 --> 45:12.577
Yes.

45:12.677 --> 45:15.377
Roger... Do you know, uh, John?

45:15.477 --> 45:17.444
Uh, yes.

45:17.544 --> 45:18.877
This is Verity.

45:18.977 --> 45:21.709
And if you actually don't
make jokes about blacks,

45:21.809 --> 45:25.244
It's reverse discrimination
saying they don't really belong.

45:25.344 --> 45:28.611
No, you have to say...
I don't have to say anything.

45:28.711 --> 45:32.311
Jews make jokes about Jews.
It's called "jewish humor."

45:32.411 --> 45:34.244
When we do it,
it's called anti-semitism.

45:34.344 --> 45:35.611
Don't you agree?

45:35.711 --> 45:38.743
You do realize this is an
emotional argument? So?

45:38.910 --> 45:41.809
It has no basis in logic whatsoever.

45:41.909 --> 45:42.977
Oh, logic.

45:43.077 --> 45:45.411
Yes! You know, logic,
that holds society together.

45:45.511 --> 45:48.244
Logic that says people shouldn't
go around killing each other.

45:48.344 --> 45:49.243
Quite right.

45:49.343 --> 45:51.343
And that also tells us...
Look...

45:51.443 --> 45:54.344
Please! I've started,
so please let me finish!

45:54.444 --> 45:56.578
Magnus magnusson.

45:56.678 --> 46:00.676
Logic also tells us that
there must be constraints,

46:00.776 --> 46:04.244
And that, if people went around
saying exactly what they feel,

46:04.344 --> 46:06.476
The result would be barbarism.

46:08.843 --> 46:11.578
And I prefer civilization.

46:11.678 --> 46:13.609
That's all.

46:20.043 --> 46:21.975
Thank you.

46:25.210 --> 46:27.477
Roger dislikes anyone being
allowed to express themselves.

46:27.577 --> 46:29.511
He sees it as a threat
to property values.

46:29.611 --> 46:31.511
I don't think that's quite fair.

46:31.611 --> 46:35.110
He won't allow a firework display for
fear a rocket falls on our thatched roof.

46:35.210 --> 46:38.177
Now you're raising a different
point. Life is dangerous!

46:38.277 --> 46:41.176
Don't you realize?

46:41.276 --> 46:44.376
And sometimes,
there's nothing you can do!

46:48.410 --> 46:50.343
That's not true.

46:53.277 --> 46:56.043
I think you can always
limit the danger.

47:01.477 --> 47:03.742
What do you say, John Morgan?

47:06.544 --> 47:09.177
Speak up. Intercede.

47:09.277 --> 47:11.576
It's a marriage.

47:11.676 --> 47:14.610
You must adjudicate
between warring parties.

47:23.410 --> 47:26.342
Well, I can see both
sides, I suppose.

49:08.310 --> 49:10.610
Oh, well, goodness.

49:10.710 --> 49:13.543
How are you?
This is a coincidence. Um...

49:13.643 --> 49:15.542
Chrissie, this is Jean Travers.

49:15.642 --> 49:17.276
Hello. Hello. Is this a coincidence?

49:17.376 --> 49:20.476
Good lord, yes. I've given
up thinking about you.

49:20.576 --> 49:23.876
Oh, yes. Um, do, please.
Or would I be interrupting?

49:23.976 --> 49:25.909
No. Not in the slightest.

49:27.310 --> 49:30.543
Uh, Chrissie came into Leeds
to pick up some gear.

49:30.643 --> 49:32.211
I ride horses.

49:32.311 --> 49:35.710
I said I'd take her and
we'd go to the cinema.

49:35.810 --> 49:37.177
Yes. Thank you.

49:37.277 --> 49:38.643
A beer please.

49:38.743 --> 49:40.643
Yes, and me.

49:40.743 --> 49:42.977
So, what are you doing?

49:43.077 --> 49:45.410
Oh, I don't know.

49:45.510 --> 49:47.343
I've already ordered.

49:47.443 --> 49:49.376
Right.

49:58.776 --> 50:01.677
I'm afraid I got frightened.

50:01.777 --> 50:03.677
Frightened?
Yes.

50:03.777 --> 50:05.610
Are you living on your own?

50:05.710 --> 50:07.442
No, as it happens, I'm not.

50:07.542 --> 50:10.676
This girl came to stay with me.
Oh, she stayed?

50:10.776 --> 50:14.244
Yes. A friend of John Morgan's.
Have you heard about this?

50:14.344 --> 50:17.376
Yes.
So you know what I mean.

50:17.543 --> 50:20.476
And then today...

50:20.576 --> 50:23.344
I just... I was going
to go home and...

50:23.444 --> 50:27.576
Then I somehow, I couldn't
face it; I just had to get out.

50:27.676 --> 50:29.610
Why does she frighten you so much?

50:29.710 --> 50:31.610
It sounds silly.

50:31.710 --> 50:34.509
Well, I can't get hold of her.

50:34.609 --> 50:37.244
She arrived on my doorstep,

50:37.344 --> 50:40.143
And I thought, "oh, she
really wants to speak to me,"

50:40.243 --> 50:44.443
Because we've had a similar
experience, I suppose.

50:44.543 --> 50:47.942
But it's as if she had
a faculty missing.

50:49.377 --> 50:53.309
She seems to say something
and then it just slips away.

50:58.277 --> 51:01.176
She has no curiosity.

51:07.643 --> 51:11.776
Also... She asked if she could
stay the night. I said fine.

51:11.876 --> 51:16.310
The next day she didn't leave
and yesterday she asked to stay.

51:24.509 --> 51:27.977
It's hard to say, but...

51:28.077 --> 51:32.242
I can understand how Morgan
became obsessed with her.

51:34.710 --> 51:36.676
Did he?
Yes.

51:38.676 --> 51:40.608
Violently, I think.

51:42.542 --> 51:46.943
She's the sort of girl that
people become obsessed with.

51:47.043 --> 51:48.976
Excuse me.

52:52.944 --> 52:56.676
Well, I mean, I can hardly
wake her up and say,

52:56.776 --> 52:59.309
"this is my friend the policeman,

52:59.409 --> 53:02.743
And he offered to come
around and tell you to leave."

53:02.843 --> 53:04.608
No.

53:07.710 --> 53:09.609
Um, I don't know.

53:09.709 --> 53:12.642
Everything gets to seem spooky.

53:14.376 --> 53:16.809
Is that where the tile was?

53:18.077 --> 53:20.543
Yes.

53:20.643 --> 53:24.010
And he fixed it?

53:24.110 --> 53:26.077
What?

53:26.177 --> 53:28.109
How did he fix it?

53:30.109 --> 53:32.042
From the inside?

53:47.043 --> 53:49.308
Chrissie's waiting for you.

53:51.476 --> 53:53.777
Yes.

53:53.877 --> 53:56.475
Thank you for driving me home.

54:44.609 --> 54:48.309
I have a list of books I
was hoping to borrow.

54:48.409 --> 54:49.677
I'm sorry.
You've been misinformed.

54:49.777 --> 54:52.008
This isn't a lending
library, you know.

54:53.443 --> 54:55.676
It's the British library,
lending division?

54:55.776 --> 54:57.910
Yes, I know.
But we don't lend books.

54:58.010 --> 55:00.109
Or, only under very
special circumstances.

55:01.609 --> 55:04.043
I have a letter from my professor.

55:04.143 --> 55:08.076
Well, that won't be nearly
special enough, I'm afraid.

55:12.375 --> 55:15.610
Or just to look at the books,
not borrow them.

55:15.710 --> 55:17.843
Oh, yes, yes.
You can look,

55:17.943 --> 55:20.176
As long as you're a registered user.

55:20.276 --> 55:22.308
But you need authorization
from London.

55:26.242 --> 55:28.509
Yes. Well, I'll get that.

55:30.143 --> 55:32.475
Then I'll come back.

56:18.610 --> 56:21.042
Go to bed. Bed!

56:39.043 --> 56:40.944
We're off now, Stanley.

56:41.044 --> 56:43.408
Don't forget to unthaw the lunch.

56:44.909 --> 56:47.977
Clearing out all that jumble
began to upset me.

56:48.077 --> 56:50.209
Really?

56:50.309 --> 56:52.043
Didn't you feel like that?

56:52.143 --> 56:53.710
The past, you mean?

56:53.810 --> 56:55.510
Mmm.

56:55.610 --> 56:57.543
That isn't like you.

56:57.643 --> 56:59.576
Second-hand clothes.

57:02.910 --> 57:06.009
They say that murderers are
drawn to the second-hand.

57:06.109 --> 57:07.843
I hadn't heard that.

57:07.943 --> 57:09.676
Yes. There's a book.

57:09.776 --> 57:11.509
You like murder, roger.

57:11.609 --> 57:15.242
Yes, oh god, yes.
I'm addicted.

57:15.342 --> 57:18.976
Yes. There's a theory that
murder is characteristically

57:19.076 --> 57:22.009
Committed by people who
handle other peoples' things

57:22.109 --> 57:25.542
In second-hand clothes shops,
junk shops, markets.

57:27.109 --> 57:29.843
Self-improvement.
That's another hallmark.

57:29.943 --> 57:32.877
People who teach themselves
things at home, at night.

57:32.977 --> 57:35.808
Theories they only half understand.

57:37.175 --> 57:39.108
Informal education.

57:41.009 --> 57:43.409
A fantasy life of singular intensity.

57:43.509 --> 57:45.743
Didn't you go to
Switzerland last year?

57:45.843 --> 57:47.743
Yes. I, uh...

57:47.843 --> 57:50.509
Yes. A package tour.

57:50.609 --> 57:53.009
To the Reichenbach falls.

57:53.109 --> 57:55.776
There were 40 of us
from all over England.

57:55.876 --> 57:59.342
To see where Moriarty pushed
Sherlock Holmes over.

57:59.442 --> 58:01.409
Wonderful countryside.

58:01.509 --> 58:03.776
What did Verity think?

58:03.876 --> 58:05.643
Ah.

58:05.743 --> 58:08.075
She didn't come with me.
No.

58:12.376 --> 58:15.475
A colleague from home
economics came along.

58:28.676 --> 58:31.109
Do you like murder?

58:31.209 --> 58:33.209
Not much.

58:33.309 --> 58:35.109
But I prefer it to romance.

58:35.209 --> 58:38.109
Hello, Lil. Sorry we're late.
The dog was sick.

58:38.209 --> 58:39.009
Oh, dear.

58:39.109 --> 58:41.009
It's on a high-fiber diet.

58:41.109 --> 58:44.708
You know what it's like.
I don't think it likes mueslix.

01:00:12.908 --> 01:00:15.142
The river flows dark
tonight, sir Thomas.

01:00:15.242 --> 01:00:16.808
Will you take my boat?

01:00:16.908 --> 01:00:20.009
Boatman, though I do not mean to
deprive you of your livelihood,

01:00:20.109 --> 01:00:21.410
I cannot take your boat.

01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:24.342
For if I travel tonight,
I shall travel to the tower.

01:00:24.442 --> 01:00:27.843
They say that is a place from
which no man can return.

01:00:27.943 --> 01:00:28.976
Aye, not alive.

01:00:29.076 --> 01:00:32.343
But boatman, we are put on
this earth to serve god's will,

01:00:32.443 --> 01:00:35.809
And if I do it tonight,
and in the fullness of my heart,

01:00:35.909 --> 01:00:38.842
He shall protect me and
lead me to a better place

01:00:38.942 --> 01:00:41.175
Than any we have known in the world.

01:00:41.275 --> 01:00:43.342
I wish you good fortune, sire.

01:00:43.442 --> 01:00:46.875
Thank you, boatman.
You are lucky to know no kings.

01:00:46.975 --> 01:00:48.875
Here, take gold.

01:00:48.975 --> 01:00:51.974
Remember me in your prayers.

01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:47.442
So what do you do?

01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:51.076
Well, come on. Answer me.

01:01:51.176 --> 01:01:54.209
I don't want Janice to
take "a" level English.

01:01:54.309 --> 01:01:56.410
Because we want her to get on.

01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:58.342
We bought her a home computer.

01:02:01.676 --> 01:02:04.309
Surely you can tell
me what your name is?

01:02:04.409 --> 01:02:05.341
Now, look!

01:02:09.076 --> 01:02:11.009
Excuse me.

01:02:11.109 --> 01:02:13.009
She's cut her hand.

01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:15.708
I wasn't saying anything!
I didn't do anything.

01:02:15.808 --> 01:02:17.775
What's your problem, man?

01:02:17.875 --> 01:02:20.475
Please, Mr. Varley, come back!

01:02:26.775 --> 01:02:28.009
What did he say?

01:02:28.109 --> 01:02:30.342
I don't know.
What difference does it make?

01:02:30.442 --> 01:02:32.208
Why can't people leave me alone?

01:03:58.476 --> 01:04:00.376
What did he want?

01:04:00.476 --> 01:04:02.975
Who?
That parent.

01:04:05.808 --> 01:04:09.742
Nothing. He just asked questions.

01:04:09.842 --> 01:04:11.841
What kind?

01:04:13.109 --> 01:04:16.874
Oh, you know. Who was I?
What was I doing here?

01:04:20.742 --> 01:04:23.008
That sounds quite innocent.

01:04:26.009 --> 01:04:29.909
It's just... I hate it.
All this asking that goes on.

01:04:30.009 --> 01:04:32.176
People digging around.

01:04:32.276 --> 01:04:35.375
The way people have
to dig into one another.

01:04:36.576 --> 01:04:38.508
It's horrible.

01:04:49.942 --> 01:04:52.875
Did you say that to John Morgan?

01:04:54.609 --> 01:04:56.509
Yes.

01:04:56.609 --> 01:05:00.041
Well... I did.

01:05:11.276 --> 01:05:13.676
No wonder.

01:05:13.776 --> 01:05:16.375
I think you drove him crazy.

01:05:21.143 --> 01:05:23.408
I don't know what you mean.

01:05:27.142 --> 01:05:29.908
No, well... Exactly. That's why.

01:05:32.975 --> 01:05:36.708
Goodness, I don't mean deliberately.
I don't mean you meant to.

01:05:36.808 --> 01:05:40.607
I never do anything!
I never say anything!

01:06:33.542 --> 01:06:35.475
Karen.

01:06:36.942 --> 01:06:38.875
Karen?

01:06:44.409 --> 01:06:46.143
It's me.

01:06:46.243 --> 01:06:49.875
Karen, listen to me, please.
Get out of here.

01:06:49.975 --> 01:06:51.309
I only want to talk.

01:06:51.409 --> 01:06:53.209
Fuck you! Get out!

01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:56.708
No, look. You must
listen to me. Please!

01:06:59.076 --> 01:07:02.743
I want some feeling!
I want some contact!

01:07:02.843 --> 01:07:05.343
I want you fucking near me!

01:07:05.443 --> 01:07:07.108
Ah!

01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:11.141
Oh!

01:07:12.709 --> 01:07:14.640
Please don't go.

01:07:16.275 --> 01:07:19.176
You make an effort.
You try and be nice!

01:07:19.276 --> 01:07:21.409
Try and do anything!

01:07:21.509 --> 01:07:23.975
You just get your head chopped off.

01:07:24.075 --> 01:07:26.007
Why try?

01:07:29.375 --> 01:07:32.542
Anyway... Tell me.

01:07:32.642 --> 01:07:35.542
Go on, tell me,
since you're so clever.

01:07:35.642 --> 01:07:37.408
What did you do?

01:07:38.942 --> 01:07:40.842
Oh, Karen.

01:07:40.942 --> 01:07:43.375
If it wasn't an accident,

01:07:44.842 --> 01:07:47.375
I'd love to know what you did.

01:07:48.475 --> 01:07:50.375
Oh, Karen.

01:07:50.475 --> 01:07:52.408
Karen...

01:07:52.508 --> 01:07:54.607
Come back!

01:08:12.842 --> 01:08:16.841
If I had the guts,
I'd just say to him,

01:08:16.942 --> 01:08:20.908
"look. I don't want you to go.
I need you."

01:08:21.009 --> 01:08:22.875
Why don't you say that?

01:08:23.042 --> 01:08:24.676
Because to him, it's everything.

01:08:24.776 --> 01:08:27.042
Being an airman is everything.

01:08:27.142 --> 01:08:29.042
Until he gets to Malaya,

01:08:29.142 --> 01:08:31.975
He isn't going to feel
being an airman is real.

01:08:32.076 --> 01:08:33.176
What do you feel?

01:08:33.276 --> 01:08:35.609
I don't know.
Of course I don't like it.

01:08:35.709 --> 01:08:38.308
Are you frightened he's
going to get killed?

01:08:38.408 --> 01:08:40.341
No.

01:08:40.441 --> 01:08:44.542
No, of course not.
I hadn't even thought of it.

01:08:44.642 --> 01:08:46.809
Why'd you say that?

01:08:46.908 --> 01:08:49.573
I'm sorry. I didn't think.

01:08:53.242 --> 01:08:55.642
With him I can't talk.

01:08:55.742 --> 01:08:58.740
With him I can't say anything I feel.

01:09:00.274 --> 01:09:02.341
Because I read books,

01:09:02.442 --> 01:09:06.142
I feel, for some reason,
I'm not allowed to talk.

01:09:06.242 --> 01:09:09.008
There's always a gulf.

01:09:12.942 --> 01:09:15.742
Doesn't seem a very
good basis for marriage.

01:09:15.841 --> 01:09:17.941
No, I suppose.

01:09:24.475 --> 01:09:26.407
Perhaps...

01:09:28.675 --> 01:09:31.076
Perhaps sex isn't everything.

01:09:31.176 --> 01:09:33.108
No.

01:09:34.942 --> 01:09:37.675
It's time that you talked to him.

01:09:37.774 --> 01:09:40.407
Soon he'll be gone.

01:09:44.242 --> 01:09:46.408
Jim.

01:09:46.509 --> 01:09:48.441
Jim, it's hopeless.

01:09:50.109 --> 01:09:52.009
How can it work anymore

01:09:52.109 --> 01:09:55.742
Snatching time when
my mum's out at cards,

01:09:55.842 --> 01:09:59.076
Knowing we can't get married
because of your parents?

01:09:59.176 --> 01:10:01.775
We'll get married.

01:10:01.875 --> 01:10:03.942
Eventually, yes.

01:10:04.042 --> 01:10:07.008
When you finally get
back from Malaya.

01:10:08.375 --> 01:10:11.974
But it's so long, it makes
everything seem pointless.

01:10:15.209 --> 01:10:17.808
Don't you think we
should be sensible?

01:10:48.109 --> 01:10:50.041
No.

01:11:36.541 --> 01:11:38.474
Hmm.

01:11:41.776 --> 01:11:43.075
Hello, boy.

01:11:50.009 --> 01:11:52.775
There's a man out here to see you.

01:12:08.508 --> 01:12:12.108
...At its most basic.

01:12:12.208 --> 01:12:14.842
Or at least not conveying the sense.
That's a possibility.

01:12:14.942 --> 01:12:16.575
You've got to take
that into account.

01:12:16.675 --> 01:12:18.776
Yes, I understand.
I don't want to press you.

01:12:18.876 --> 01:12:19.775
No. Go ahead.

01:12:19.875 --> 01:12:21.375
Hello. How are you?

01:12:21.475 --> 01:12:23.475
...Your arms above your head.

01:12:23.575 --> 01:12:25.241
I'm just taking that as an example.

01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:26.842
Does that necessarily
mean you're happy?

01:12:26.942 --> 01:12:28.942
You look shattered.

01:12:29.042 --> 01:12:30.475
...Happiness in certain circumstances

01:12:30.575 --> 01:12:33.108
According to those
circumstances, certainly, yes.

01:12:33.208 --> 01:12:36.074
Or, it can mean release, or triumph.

01:12:43.909 --> 01:12:46.674
I'm afraid I've had
some trouble at home.

01:12:49.976 --> 01:12:52.807
Chrissie went back to her husband.

01:12:54.241 --> 01:12:56.142
She had one already?

01:12:56.242 --> 01:12:57.507
Oh, yes.

01:12:59.109 --> 01:13:01.909
Who she told me she
never saw anymore.

01:13:02.009 --> 01:13:03.941
But all the time...

01:13:06.208 --> 01:13:09.042
I don't know.

01:13:09.142 --> 01:13:12.041
It turns out I was a subplot.

01:13:12.141 --> 01:13:15.375
The real story was
happening elsewhere.

01:13:15.475 --> 01:13:17.407
That's a terrible feeling.

01:13:18.975 --> 01:13:20.907
Yeah. The worst.

01:13:25.308 --> 01:13:29.175
It's shaken my whole idea of myself.

01:13:29.275 --> 01:13:33.408
You know, what I'm
doing as a policeman.

01:13:33.508 --> 01:13:37.241
I mean, if the day was
no good, if it was...

01:13:37.341 --> 01:13:41.774
Awful or silly, I could always
go back to Chrissie and laugh.

01:13:43.408 --> 01:13:46.742
Now it turns out that
she wasn't really with me.

01:13:46.842 --> 01:13:48.809
She laughed...

01:13:48.909 --> 01:13:51.174
But she was elsewhere.

01:13:56.241 --> 01:13:58.141
What's he like?

01:13:58.241 --> 01:14:00.475
Awful.

01:14:00.575 --> 01:14:03.407
He's the sort of man who keeps sheep.

01:14:05.408 --> 01:14:07.308
I mean, for god's sake,

01:14:07.408 --> 01:14:11.173
If you want wool,
go and buy it in a shop.

01:14:14.775 --> 01:14:17.175
Listen.
I'll tell you why I'm here.

01:14:17.275 --> 01:14:19.342
I was piecing together the evening.

01:14:19.442 --> 01:14:20.908
Can't you leave it?

01:14:22.241 --> 01:14:24.274
Well, yes.

01:14:24.742 --> 01:14:26.608
This is just an amateur's interest.

01:14:31.308 --> 01:14:33.908
All right.

01:14:36.108 --> 01:14:38.140
It's just that...

01:14:40.842 --> 01:14:43.575
There was food...

01:14:43.675 --> 01:14:46.308
Then there was talking...

01:14:46.408 --> 01:14:48.340
Then you went upstairs.

01:14:50.308 --> 01:14:53.941
Didn't you have a few
moments alone with him?

01:14:54.041 --> 01:14:56.175
When you were together...

01:14:56.275 --> 01:14:58.409
What did you talk about?

01:14:58.509 --> 01:15:00.508
Fixing the roof.

01:15:02.342 --> 01:15:05.908
It's just that roger...
your colleague, roger... says...

01:15:06.008 --> 01:15:09.808
That when you came back,
he remembers that you'd changed.

01:15:09.908 --> 01:15:11.508
Changed?

01:15:13.475 --> 01:15:16.375
Not, uh... I don't mean...
I'm not saying...

01:15:16.475 --> 01:15:18.375
As a person.

01:15:18.475 --> 01:15:21.041
Your clothes.

01:15:21.141 --> 01:15:24.407
Well, I put on my trousers.
I'd snagged my stocking.

01:15:26.575 --> 01:15:28.507
Oh, gosh.

01:15:34.374 --> 01:15:36.341
Poor you.

01:15:36.441 --> 01:15:38.908
So, how are you managing alone?

01:15:40.975 --> 01:15:43.574
Don't you think you should tell me?

01:15:47.875 --> 01:15:49.808
What happened?

01:15:52.175 --> 01:15:54.341
Was it your fault?

01:15:58.941 --> 01:16:01.575
I th... I think.

01:16:01.675 --> 01:16:03.941
In a way.

01:16:11.375 --> 01:16:14.040
It's because he was a stranger.

01:16:16.975 --> 01:16:19.574
No. I'm not sure I can explain.

01:16:23.542 --> 01:16:25.474
Because I didn't know him.

01:16:31.275 --> 01:16:34.708
Now I can feel him dragging me down.

01:16:39.341 --> 01:16:41.742
I thought I could get over it,

01:16:41.842 --> 01:16:45.107
But now, everywhere,
the darkness beckons.

01:16:46.675 --> 01:16:49.375
These things become real.

01:16:49.475 --> 01:16:51.841
He wants me down there.

01:16:53.475 --> 01:16:55.008
Well, you have to fight.

01:16:55.108 --> 01:16:57.207
Well, I have fought.

01:16:59.741 --> 01:17:02.808
How dare you?

01:17:02.908 --> 01:17:06.174
I fought for three weeks,
and you didn't help.

01:17:07.941 --> 01:17:11.408
Sending me that
miserable little girl.

01:17:11.508 --> 01:17:14.107
What gives you that right?

01:17:16.608 --> 01:17:18.541
To meddle?

01:17:21.942 --> 01:17:25.207
Police always bring sadness.

01:17:44.008 --> 01:17:45.940
I'm going to sit here.

01:17:47.709 --> 01:17:50.542
I won't go away.

01:17:50.642 --> 01:17:54.842
Now, Stanley...
Don't drink too much, please.

01:17:54.942 --> 01:17:57.341
Last night, you were stupid with gin.

01:17:57.441 --> 01:17:59.374
I like gin.

01:18:00.442 --> 01:18:01.908
Oh.

01:18:02.008 --> 01:18:03.642
I rang the bell.

01:18:03.742 --> 01:18:06.340
Well, she can see us
through the window.

01:18:09.841 --> 01:18:12.007
Jean?

01:18:12.107 --> 01:18:14.040
I'm John Morgan.

01:18:18.309 --> 01:18:19.575
Hello.

01:18:19.675 --> 01:18:22.108
Oh, you brought an extra.

01:18:22.208 --> 01:18:24.708
Come on. Come on in.

01:18:24.808 --> 01:18:25.808
The more, the merrier.

01:18:25.908 --> 01:18:28.142
John Morgan.

01:18:28.242 --> 01:18:31.007
I've already told Stanley
not to get drunk.

01:18:35.542 --> 01:18:37.873
What?

01:18:40.875 --> 01:18:42.807
Revenge.

01:18:47.008 --> 01:18:50.774
That's what it is. Revenge!
That's what she's doing!

01:18:50.874 --> 01:18:53.174
Who?

01:18:53.274 --> 01:18:55.207
The prime minister.

01:18:56.974 --> 01:19:00.973
She's taking some...
Terrible revenge for something.

01:19:02.675 --> 01:19:06.441
Some deep damage. Something
inside. God knows what.

01:19:08.041 --> 01:19:11.840
For crimes behind the privet hedge.

01:19:13.242 --> 01:19:17.175
And now the whole
country's suffering!

01:19:17.275 --> 01:19:19.241
Yet we've done nothing to her.

01:19:19.341 --> 01:19:21.108
Do you think that?

01:19:21.208 --> 01:19:23.275
Yes, I do.

01:19:23.375 --> 01:19:24.575
Coq au vin.

01:19:24.675 --> 01:19:26.541
Oh! Wonderful!

01:19:26.641 --> 01:19:28.542
Stanley, you're drunk.

01:19:28.642 --> 01:19:30.375
One drunk?

01:19:30.475 --> 01:19:32.375
Yes, I am.
Drunk and disorderly,

01:19:32.475 --> 01:19:34.008
Where once I was orderly.

01:19:34.108 --> 01:19:35.408
Who's first?

01:19:35.508 --> 01:19:38.942
I used to keep my thoughts
in neat rows like vegetables.

01:19:39.042 --> 01:19:40.942
All pegged out under cloches.

01:19:41.042 --> 01:19:44.941
I kept my thoughts under cloches.
Now, they grow wild.

01:19:45.041 --> 01:19:46.941
Marcia?

01:19:47.041 --> 01:19:49.208
Oh, sorry.
You wouldn't know.

01:19:49.308 --> 01:19:51.342
I am the local solicitor.

01:19:51.442 --> 01:19:54.841
The town's official
sanctifier of greed.

01:19:54.941 --> 01:19:57.008
Those little unseemly transactions.

01:19:57.108 --> 01:19:59.342
I'll just take some of this.
Verity.

01:19:59.442 --> 01:20:01.875
I see people as they truly are.

01:20:01.975 --> 01:20:04.409
Nonsense.

01:20:04.509 --> 01:20:06.841
Oh, this smells marvelous.

01:20:06.941 --> 01:20:10.875
I remember once, my father,

01:20:10.975 --> 01:20:12.941
Also a solicitor,

01:20:13.041 --> 01:20:18.175
Said, "I have learnt never to judge

01:20:18.275 --> 01:20:23.807
Any man from his behavior with
money and the opposite sex."

01:20:28.241 --> 01:20:31.341
Yet it is my own saddened experience

01:20:31.441 --> 01:20:35.441
That those are the only
ways to judge them.

01:20:35.541 --> 01:20:36.675
Salad?

01:20:36.775 --> 01:20:38.108
Thank you.

01:20:38.208 --> 01:20:40.108
Stanley thinks good of nobody.

01:20:40.208 --> 01:20:42.075
Not true.

01:20:42.175 --> 01:20:44.208
I expect good of nobody.

01:20:44.308 --> 01:20:45.908
Thank you.

01:20:46.008 --> 01:20:48.540
And I'm sometimes
pleasantly surprised.

01:20:50.642 --> 01:20:52.108
There we are.

01:20:52.208 --> 01:20:54.307
And when I find good,

01:20:56.175 --> 01:20:58.075
My first feeling

01:20:58.175 --> 01:21:00.774
Is one of nostalgia for
something we've lost.

01:21:00.874 --> 01:21:03.140
Here, take.
Thanks.

01:21:04.774 --> 01:21:07.775
Ask John Morgan.

01:21:07.875 --> 01:21:09.807
John.

01:21:12.441 --> 01:21:14.341
Well, I don't know.

01:21:14.441 --> 01:21:16.008
Go on.

01:21:16.108 --> 01:21:19.008
I only know...

01:21:19.108 --> 01:21:22.640
Goodness...

01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:25.308
And anger...

01:21:25.408 --> 01:21:28.541
And revenge...

01:21:28.641 --> 01:21:30.574
And evil...

01:21:32.541 --> 01:21:34.473
And desire.

01:21:35.808 --> 01:21:38.541
These seem to me far
better words than

01:21:38.641 --> 01:21:42.008
Neurosis and psychology and paranoia.

01:21:42.108 --> 01:21:44.541
These old words.

01:21:45.008 --> 01:21:48.707
These good, old words
have a sort of... Conviction,

01:21:50.442 --> 01:21:54.374
Which all this modern apparatus
of language now lacks.

01:21:57.007 --> 01:21:58.908
Ah, well, yes.

01:21:59.008 --> 01:22:01.508
We bury these words.

01:22:01.608 --> 01:22:04.442
These simple feelings.

01:22:04.542 --> 01:22:06.807
We bury them deep.

01:22:08.174 --> 01:22:11.408
And all the building over
that constitutes this century

01:22:11.508 --> 01:22:14.374
Will not wish these feelings away.

01:22:16.908 --> 01:22:19.708
Yes, well, you'll have to say
what you really mean by that.

01:22:19.808 --> 01:22:22.309
Would I?

01:22:22.409 --> 01:22:25.007
Yeah.
Define your terms.

01:22:27.408 --> 01:22:29.341
They don't need defining.

01:22:30.908 --> 01:22:34.940
If you can't feel them,
you might as well be dead.

01:22:47.741 --> 01:22:51.275
Well... What do you think?

01:22:51.375 --> 01:22:54.639
Well, of course, you look wonderful.

01:23:02.874 --> 01:23:05.207
You don't like me going.

01:23:07.774 --> 01:23:10.075
What makes you say that?

01:23:10.175 --> 01:23:12.374
I've never said that.

01:23:13.741 --> 01:23:15.641
I've encouraged you.

01:23:15.741 --> 01:23:18.174
I can see it's your happiness.

01:23:20.042 --> 01:23:22.540
You've never been happier than today.

01:23:23.841 --> 01:23:27.773
I've always told you,
you must do what you want.

01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:31.541
Yes.

01:23:31.641 --> 01:23:35.407
You supported me, and...
And I've been grateful.

01:23:36.808 --> 01:23:40.007
I'll come back.
We'll have a house.

01:23:47.908 --> 01:23:50.641
If you want to stop me, you can.

01:23:50.741 --> 01:23:53.674
No. I'll study. I've lots to do.

01:23:57.974 --> 01:24:00.073
Are you being true with me?

01:24:01.707 --> 01:24:03.440
True?

01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:05.473
What's it mean?

01:24:14.607 --> 01:24:18.773
If you've anything
to say, speak it now.

01:24:23.974 --> 01:24:25.907
Nothing.

01:24:36.741 --> 01:24:40.240
Good-bye.

01:26:22.808 --> 01:26:25.675
Oh!

01:26:25.775 --> 01:26:27.207
Where'd that come from?

01:26:27.307 --> 01:26:29.541
Oh, god.

01:26:29.641 --> 01:26:31.707
It looks as if your
roof is in trouble.

01:26:31.807 --> 01:26:33.573
I'm very practical.

01:26:35.841 --> 01:26:37.873
Right.

01:26:58.708 --> 01:27:00.707
Show me your money.

01:27:14.474 --> 01:27:16.573
Put that in your shoe.

01:27:27.142 --> 01:27:29.074
Let's go in.

01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:37.908
What you said...

01:27:38.008 --> 01:27:42.272
What you said about those
feelings, it made such sense.

01:27:43.541 --> 01:27:46.808
Yes. I thought you'd understand me.

01:27:46.908 --> 01:27:48.840
It's here.

01:28:06.374 --> 01:28:10.340
Take part in your game.

01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:13.474
We would like to.

01:28:13.574 --> 01:28:18.273
We have heard, the best
game of poker in Malaya.

01:28:28.374 --> 01:28:30.306
Okay.

01:28:47.474 --> 01:28:49.506
Thanks very much.

01:29:01.608 --> 01:29:03.508
I think it's fixed.

01:29:03.608 --> 01:29:05.206
Thank you.

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:08.373
Shall we go down?

01:29:12.474 --> 01:29:13.574
What have you given him?

01:29:13.674 --> 01:29:15.407
Okay. It's okay.
I have something.

01:29:15.507 --> 01:29:16.974
- Oh!
- Don't drag him!

01:29:23.641 --> 01:29:26.273
Who runs this game?
I thought you were the boss!

01:29:26.373 --> 01:29:29.040
No fighting, please.

01:29:31.308 --> 01:29:32.407
I have something.

01:29:32.507 --> 01:29:35.008
Step in here.

01:29:35.108 --> 01:29:38.073
I will give you some
medicine for him.

01:30:27.707 --> 01:30:31.974
I love the slow evenings
when summer begins to come.

01:30:33.474 --> 01:30:36.407
It doesn't get dark until 8:00.

01:30:39.574 --> 01:30:42.407
Absurd. It isn't possible.

01:30:42.507 --> 01:30:44.841
No.

01:30:44.941 --> 01:30:47.073
English airman...

01:31:35.441 --> 01:31:37.874
Listen...

01:31:37.974 --> 01:31:39.842
I know you're in trouble.

01:31:39.942 --> 01:31:41.274
What?

01:31:41.374 --> 01:31:43.707
You're in trouble...
Like me.

01:31:43.807 --> 01:31:46.608
No. No, I don't know what you mean.

01:31:46.708 --> 01:31:48.307
Come on.

01:31:48.407 --> 01:31:50.675
I... No.

01:31:50.775 --> 01:31:52.675
You're lonely.

01:31:52.775 --> 01:31:55.808
Yes, well, I'm lonely,
but I'm not in trouble.

01:31:55.908 --> 01:31:57.174
Please don't argue.

01:31:57.274 --> 01:32:00.674
All that hope coming out of you,
all that cheerful resolution.

01:32:00.774 --> 01:32:03.040
All that wonderful enlightenment...

01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:06.307
For what? For nothing.

01:32:06.407 --> 01:32:07.841
You know it's for nothing.

01:32:07.941 --> 01:32:10.174
Don't tell me that
cheerfulness is real.

01:32:10.274 --> 01:32:11.372
Yes, of course.

01:32:12.674 --> 01:32:17.006
You and I...
We understand each other.

01:32:17.106 --> 01:32:19.073
What? No. What?

01:32:19.173 --> 01:32:23.407
You fake. You fake
all that cheerfulness.

01:32:23.507 --> 01:32:26.674
No! I don't. It's who I am.

01:32:26.774 --> 01:32:28.741
Then why did you lead me up here?

01:32:28.841 --> 01:32:29.973
I didn't.

01:32:30.073 --> 01:32:32.006
Liar!

01:32:35.241 --> 01:32:38.341
You know. You know
where you're looking.

01:32:38.441 --> 01:32:40.174
No, I don't.

01:32:40.274 --> 01:32:43.107
You've been here, where I am.

01:32:43.207 --> 01:32:45.139
No, I haven't.

01:33:12.274 --> 01:33:14.107
I'm sorry.

01:33:14.207 --> 01:33:17.841
But I haven't been more ill.

01:33:17.941 --> 01:33:19.874
I have to change.

01:33:19.974 --> 01:33:20.907
No.

01:33:21.007 --> 01:33:23.906
Yes. Oh, please.

01:33:27.074 --> 01:33:29.006
You will!

01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:42.273
Out into the night,

01:33:42.373 --> 01:33:46.073
And then good night again.

01:33:46.173 --> 01:33:49.374
Oops!

01:33:49.474 --> 01:33:53.240
Oh! The drinking of whisky
the drinking of gin...

01:33:55.940 --> 01:33:58.039
It's been very pleasant.

01:34:01.474 --> 01:34:04.640
Would you mind
if I came around again?

01:34:41.141 --> 01:34:43.773
There. Hold me tight.

01:35:41.574 --> 01:35:43.807
Jessica, aren't you coming with me?

01:35:43.907 --> 01:35:45.740
Yes. On the 16th.

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:47.574
I can't go on the english trip.

01:35:47.674 --> 01:35:48.972
Oh, yes, you can.

01:35:50.207 --> 01:35:52.872
Right then, everyone.
Good morning.

01:35:54.107 --> 01:35:55.840
Window, please.

01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:58.373
Gosh. A dirty
blackboard already.

01:36:06.907 --> 01:36:10.274
Where's Suzie, please?

01:36:10.374 --> 01:36:12.341
Anyone know?

01:36:12.441 --> 01:36:14.274
She's run away to London, miss.

01:36:14.374 --> 01:36:17.974
With Alfred Egerton in science fifth.

01:36:18.074 --> 01:36:20.973
Has she been in touch
with her parents?

01:36:21.073 --> 01:36:22.307
Yes, miss.
Good.

01:36:22.407 --> 01:36:24.640
She said she couldn't
see the point of school.

01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:26.506
No?

01:36:28.608 --> 01:36:31.873
Well, sometimes,
I have that problem.

01:36:31.973 --> 01:36:34.007
Anyone else?

01:36:34.107 --> 01:36:36.373
Anyone else want to go?

01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:43.974
Right, then.

01:36:44.074 --> 01:36:46.807
For those of us still remaining...

01:36:46.907 --> 01:36:50.807
Us maniacs, assorted
oddballs, eccentrics,

01:36:50.907 --> 01:36:55.606
Folk who still think
education is worthwhile...

01:36:55.706 --> 01:36:57.805
I suggest we keep trying.

01:36:59.474 --> 01:37:01.473
All right, everyone?

01:37:02.707 --> 01:37:04.640
Good.

01:37:09.107 --> 01:37:11.039
Then, let's work.

01:38:41.407 --> 01:38:43.340
How are you?

01:38:48.241 --> 01:38:50.074
How are you?

01:38:50.174 --> 01:38:52.106
I'm better.

01:38:58.007 --> 01:38:59.939
How's Marcia?

01:39:01.941 --> 01:39:03.872
Tremendous.

01:39:05.441 --> 01:39:07.372
Oh, yes.

01:39:09.207 --> 01:39:12.972
The charity bridge tournament
takes up all her time.

01:39:39.773 --> 01:39:43.174
When you're a boy, you think,
"oh, it's so easy."

01:39:43.274 --> 01:39:46.139
Always wipe the slate and move on.

01:39:47.874 --> 01:39:51.940
Then, with the years, you find
you become a prisoner of dreams.

01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:55.607
A girl ran away this morning.

01:39:55.707 --> 01:39:57.940
Good luck to her.

01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:00.341
Yes.

01:40:00.441 --> 01:40:02.706
Good luck.

01:40:06.574 --> 01:40:09.173
To all our escapes.
