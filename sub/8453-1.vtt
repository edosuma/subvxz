WEBVTT

00:01.314 --> 00:04.124
I love that you were
named after Bob Dylan.

00:08.488 --> 00:09.899
Bob Dylan.

00:09.989 --> 00:10.967
(ANIMALS CALLING)

00:14.961 --> 00:17.840
LILY: You hear that sound?
Those are lemurs.

00:17.931 --> 00:21.708
They're primates, they sound like
people laughing in the distance.

00:21.801 --> 00:23.246
DYLAN: They freak me out.

00:23.870 --> 00:25.577
You sound like a lemur.

00:26.039 --> 00:27.040
LILY: What?

00:27.140 --> 00:29.643
I'm worried Lily's gonna hurt Dylan.

00:29.776 --> 00:32.655
No, it's gonna be the other way around.

00:32.779 --> 00:35.157
Well, how do you figure that?

00:35.281 --> 00:38.421
'Cause she's a farm girl, Ben... jamin.

00:38.518 --> 00:40.657
And,

00:40.787 --> 00:44.599
he's like this exotic
creature from the city.

00:44.691 --> 00:48.104
- Exotic? My son?
- (LAUGHING) Yes.

00:50.129 --> 00:53.576
I was afraid you thought
he was a little bit of a jerk.

00:55.869 --> 00:58.907
I'm guessing that Rosie was more like
your wife and Dylan's more like you

00:59.005 --> 01:00.643
and that's why you're so hard on him.

01:04.777 --> 01:08.190
I want you to know,
I think you're incredibly pretty.

01:10.016 --> 01:12.428
Please, don't take offense
if I don't hit on you.

01:12.519 --> 01:13.998
I'd be offended if you did.

01:15.054 --> 01:16.032
Good.

01:16.155 --> 01:18.157
I'm a big fan of people
being exactly who they are.

01:18.291 --> 01:20.100
- Exactly.
- So we think alike.

01:20.193 --> 01:21.194
We do.

01:21.327 --> 01:23.466
And if I wanted to be kissed by you,
you wouldn't have a choice.

01:24.998 --> 01:27.103
Thank you. I think.

01:27.200 --> 01:28.941
I don't doubt that.

01:29.035 --> 01:31.208
- What did we just say?
- I don't know.

01:31.337 --> 01:32.873
Okay.

01:37.944 --> 01:39.116
(SIGHS)

01:41.748 --> 01:43.989
it's a lot to take on. All of us.

01:47.587 --> 01:49.191
I'll see you tomorrow, right?

RHONDA: <i>It hurts me
to tell you this.</i>

02:36.202 --> 02:38.648
I've been checking his bills.

02:38.738 --> 02:40.740
The zoo account is empty.

02:41.507 --> 02:46.047
He has no more money.
He has no idea what he's doing.

02:46.179 --> 02:51.424
He is going to end up selling
this place to somebody for cheap.

02:51.551 --> 02:53.053
For the land alone.

02:53.186 --> 02:54.665
That's right, Robin!

02:54.954 --> 02:56.729
I am warning you now.

02:57.924 --> 03:00.564
Behind that front is a front!

03:01.694 --> 03:05.039
Benjamin Mee is a fraud!

03:08.034 --> 03:09.877
- Hey.
- DUNCAN: What else you got?

03:09.969 --> 03:11.710
It's a bad idea. Let me call you back.

03:11.804 --> 03:14.512
You gotta look at this.
She left a deposit slip.

03:14.607 --> 03:16.416
And it led me to that.

03:17.377 --> 03:19.186
Let's go.

03:31.958 --> 03:33.062
Do you know what she did for you?

03:33.593 --> 03:35.197
I think so.

03:36.329 --> 03:38.104
She knew exactly what you would do.

03:38.564 --> 03:40.737
You'd make a bad investment,
need to start over,

03:40.833 --> 03:42.278
and have to have a cushion.

03:43.336 --> 03:45.111
This is your cushion.

03:46.005 --> 03:48.451
- $84,000, man.
- Oh, my God.

03:48.574 --> 03:50.485
$84,000.

03:51.911 --> 03:53.754
It's unbelievable.

03:53.846 --> 03:56.554
She's still lookin' out for you, man.

04:02.522 --> 04:03.592
She calls it your circus money.

04:03.690 --> 04:05.226
Circus money, yeah.

04:06.459 --> 04:09.565
- This next part's kind of hurtful.
- Yeah.

04:09.662 --> 04:11.664
It says, "Listen to your heart,
not your brother."

04:11.798 --> 04:13.402
I know, I read that. She loved you, man.

04:13.499 --> 04:15.809
She used three exclamation marks.

04:15.935 --> 04:16.970
She loved you.

04:17.470 --> 04:19.950
Well, I can see why you
still carry the torch.

04:20.039 --> 04:22.815
Yeah, but with $84,000,
we'll cut a few corners,

04:22.942 --> 04:24.512
but I know we can make the inspection.

04:25.278 --> 04:26.484
No, Benji.

04:26.813 --> 04:28.349
Here's what she's saying.

04:28.948 --> 04:31.588
You're free. You realize that.

04:32.885 --> 04:34.865
Listen.

04:34.987 --> 04:36.364
Benji.

04:36.489 --> 04:39.959
You did it, man. You went to the circus.

04:40.059 --> 04:41.902
You changed Dylan and Rosie's lives.

04:41.994 --> 04:44.406
They're gonna have
those memories forever.

04:44.497 --> 04:47.944
But staying here and going down in flames,

04:48.034 --> 04:51.982
that's not what Katherine wanted.
She wanted you to be free.

04:53.005 --> 04:55.713
This money is your ticket out.

04:55.842 --> 04:59.346
And if you won't listen to your brother,
the accountant,

04:59.746 --> 05:01.191
then listen to your wife

05:01.914 --> 05:05.726
who clearly planned
a financial future for you.

05:07.653 --> 05:09.030
Okay.

05:10.656 --> 05:12.033
Here.

05:13.326 --> 05:14.703
Thanks.

05:22.335 --> 05:24.372
I hear you may not be
staying here much longer.

05:25.271 --> 05:26.375
Seriously?

05:27.540 --> 05:28.917
Yeah.

05:31.611 --> 05:36.060
But if you still want to befriends,
you know, I'll still be your friend.

05:37.383 --> 05:39.522
I mean, there are still cars and all.

05:39.619 --> 05:41.326
Well, yeah, of course,

05:41.420 --> 05:43.195
but are you for real with this?

05:48.461 --> 05:51.908
Oh, yes! This is fantastic.

05:53.099 --> 05:54.601
I'm goin' home.

05:56.035 --> 05:57.673
See my friends.

06:02.875 --> 06:04.855
Hey, listen, I gotta go.

06:06.579 --> 06:08.525
Don't tell anybody what I heard, okay?

06:08.614 --> 06:10.423
Sure! Thanks!

06:12.084 --> 06:14.394
You don't have to leave so fast.

06:21.093 --> 06:22.128
I'm goin' home.

06:22.895 --> 06:25.876
It's Rhonda.
She's leavin' for some job in Mexico

06:25.965 --> 06:27.535
and she just turned everybody against you.

06:27.633 --> 06:31.445
They're all in there. Says you don't
have any more money, man.

06:32.572 --> 06:34.574
- She says you're a fraud.
- I got it.

06:37.977 --> 06:38.955
Well...

06:41.781 --> 06:45.957
I want to say it has been
an amazing experience here.

06:47.687 --> 06:52.432
Each of you,
I've come to know in some small way.

06:53.526 --> 06:55.836
But the financial climate being what it is,

06:55.928 --> 06:57.805
(SCOFFS)
- I think none of us thought we'd...

06:59.532 --> 07:00.977
Well...

07:02.301 --> 07:04.406
I don't know how to say this.

07:14.213 --> 07:17.092
I've been an adventure addict
my whole life.

07:17.183 --> 07:20.653
With no big regard for cost.

07:23.789 --> 07:25.962
With... Well, with no regard for cost.

07:27.059 --> 07:31.007
Basically, I was just an observer
and a writer.

07:31.130 --> 07:35.442
But this is my first real adventure.

07:39.472 --> 07:41.509
And I just want to say that

07:43.509 --> 07:47.013
it's been the best one of all
because it's personal.

07:52.051 --> 07:53.553
And thanks to my Katherine,

08:03.896 --> 08:05.534
the money came through.

08:06.999 --> 08:09.570
So, I don't know what you've heard,

08:10.369 --> 08:15.079
but I am able to say,
though I don't have a lot,

08:15.875 --> 08:18.583
I do have enough to get us by.

08:18.711 --> 08:21.214
And if you stick with me,
I will give this everything.

08:21.347 --> 08:25.261
But I will need everything from you
and we are going to reopen this zoo.

08:25.384 --> 08:27.694
It is the best job in the world.

08:28.721 --> 08:31.930
And it's gonna take everything
to make it work.

08:33.893 --> 08:37.705
So don't... Don't give up on our adventure.

08:38.164 --> 08:39.575
Well, that's good enough for me.

08:39.664 --> 08:42.077
- LILY: Me, too.
- Done, man.

08:42.168 --> 08:43.442
- All right.
- Whoo!

08:48.607 --> 08:50.416
Yeah!

08:50.509 --> 08:51.715
Circus money, man.

08:51.811 --> 08:54.417
Our adventure is just beginning.

08:54.513 --> 08:55.958
That's not what I meant.

08:56.082 --> 08:58.153
I know.

08:58.284 --> 08:59.991
And Rhonda?

09:00.786 --> 09:02.959
I wish you the best in Mexico.

09:03.089 --> 09:04.397
I don't speak Spanish.

09:04.857 --> 09:06.302
<i>Adi√≥s.</i>

09:08.761 --> 09:10.331
All right.

09:35.488 --> 09:36.660
(SQUEAKING)

09:42.461 --> 09:43.838
Cut!

09:44.497 --> 09:46.841
- All right!
- Almost there, buddy!

10:04.183 --> 10:05.662
You just get that hat?

10:05.751 --> 10:08.197
So you woke up this morning
and you thought to yourself...

10:08.320 --> 10:09.890
it's cold.

10:10.022 --> 10:11.524
"I'm gonna put on this hat."

10:11.657 --> 10:13.364
Why? What do I look like in the hat?

10:15.361 --> 10:16.772
(LAUGHS)

10:24.203 --> 10:26.376
I think Spar will like these.

10:26.705 --> 10:29.345
All right, do we need anything else
while we're in the land of people?

10:29.442 --> 10:30.978
Nope. I'm good.

10:31.077 --> 10:32.147
Yeah?

10:32.845 --> 10:35.587
How come you don't tell stories any more?

10:35.714 --> 10:38.888
Well, because we're livin' the story.

10:39.018 --> 10:40.554
I wish we could tell Mom that.

10:41.454 --> 10:43.400
You don't think Mom knows?

10:43.522 --> 10:45.058
I know she knows.

10:46.425 --> 10:47.836
Me, too.

10:52.298 --> 10:55.108
Okay. $74.39.

10:55.234 --> 10:56.338
(EXHALES)

10:56.469 --> 10:57.880
I don't come up with the prices.

10:57.970 --> 11:00.246
No, it's not the prices. it's me.

11:02.441 --> 11:03.613
It's really well worn.

11:03.742 --> 11:06.450
- It might not work.
- It'll work.

11:07.213 --> 11:08.590
- It... it'll work.
- No, no, no.

11:08.714 --> 11:11.786
It's just that it says
"Rosemoor Animal Park".

11:11.917 --> 11:14.056
- That's the one.
- You work there?

11:14.153 --> 11:16.531
I do, and I also own it.

11:17.323 --> 11:19.394
Strange but true.

11:19.492 --> 11:21.438
- We bought a zoo!
- Throttle down.

11:21.994 --> 11:24.235
I love that zoo!

11:24.330 --> 11:25.741
Really?

11:25.831 --> 11:28.437
Oh, my... We used to go there all the time!

11:28.567 --> 11:30.308
- Is it gonna open again soon?
- BENJAMIN: Yes.

11:30.402 --> 11:32.006
We're gonna open in a few days.

11:32.138 --> 11:33.913
We're goin' for the 7th, 7/7.

11:34.006 --> 11:36.452
7/7. Well, you know what?
I'm gonna be there.

11:36.575 --> 11:39.920
You reserve me nine tickets,
'cause I'm gonna bring the in-laws.

11:40.012 --> 11:42.618
And maybe we could feed
a couple of 'em to the tigers.

11:42.748 --> 11:43.954
(LAUGHING)

11:45.584 --> 11:47.222
Thank you so much.

11:48.621 --> 11:51.830
I'm sorry. Mister! Your bulbs.

11:54.026 --> 11:56.506
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

11:56.629 --> 11:58.666
- 7/7.
- 7/7.

11:58.964 --> 12:02.275
You want to hear somethin' crazy?
I think we're gonna be okay.

12:02.568 --> 12:04.206
(GROANS)

12:06.472 --> 12:07.917
Come on, man, we talked about this.

12:08.007 --> 12:09.850
You gotta eat that food
to get all the meds.

12:11.177 --> 12:14.181
You know, there's a major buzz
waitin' for you inside that meat.

12:14.880 --> 12:16.791
Your neurotransmitters are gonna be firin'

12:16.882 --> 12:19.385
all the way to the moon and back.

12:19.518 --> 12:21.725
You'll be dating seven-year-olds.

12:21.854 --> 12:24.630
Have every house cat from here to El Cajon.

12:31.063 --> 12:34.374
Buddy, if you don't eat the food

12:35.201 --> 12:37.511
- and you don't get your medicine,
(SNARLING)

12:42.575 --> 12:44.851
it all goes downhill very fast.

12:47.279 --> 12:49.555
I'm tellin' you the truth.

12:54.253 --> 12:55.664
Trust me.

13:00.359 --> 13:02.498
Come on, man, we're almost there.

13:02.595 --> 13:04.575
You gotta stick with me.

13:10.202 --> 13:12.375
We got opening day comin' up.

13:21.880 --> 13:23.621
He's fine. He's okay.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.051
Well, can we use the ladder?

14:43.483 --> 14:44.894
We tried luring him with food.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.225
He's gotta come down from there.

14:46.319 --> 14:47.798
He's gotta eat his food,
he's gotta drink water,

14:47.921 --> 14:48.922
he's gotta take his medication.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.193
He's dehydrated.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.463
I mean, we've gotta
get him into the enclosure.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.367
Are the other two inside?

14:54.461 --> 14:56.702
- Benjamin!
- Look, if he moves to attack me,

14:56.796 --> 14:58.104
at least he'll be moving, right?

14:58.231 --> 15:00.711
- He's slow, I can outrun him.
- It's not a bullfight.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.370
Benjamin!

15:03.236 --> 15:04.408
I think it's time.

15:07.474 --> 15:08.452
For what?

15:08.842 --> 15:10.719
He's ready. Let's call the vet.

15:10.810 --> 15:12.551
You're the owner. You have to okay this.

15:20.754 --> 15:21.755
No, man.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.299
Look, this doesn't feel right.

15:26.993 --> 15:28.973
Benjamin, it never feels right.

15:32.365 --> 15:35.278
- Stuck?
- Yeah, stuck. He's stuck.

15:35.368 --> 15:38.008
- Anybody, ideas?
- Loud noises scare the big cats.

15:38.138 --> 15:39.583
Loud noises scare the big cats.

15:39.672 --> 15:40.650
Wait. Hold on.

15:40.774 --> 15:41.752
LILY: We can scare him
into goin' back in.

15:41.841 --> 15:43.081
That's a good idea. All right,

15:43.176 --> 15:44.246
- when I give the signal...
- Hey, hold on a sec.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.187
You guys just yell, scream,
make as much noise as possible.

15:46.312 --> 15:47.586
Spar's gonna hate it,
but maybe he'll come down.

15:47.680 --> 15:48.750
I don't know. it's our only option.

15:48.848 --> 15:50.020
- Hold on.
- KELLY: So, guys, get pots, pans,

15:50.150 --> 15:51.254
stuff like that, okay?

15:51.351 --> 15:52.853
Nathan? Nathan, go to two.

15:52.986 --> 15:55.432
Nathan? Nathan, wake up!

15:57.724 --> 15:59.795
- (ALL SHOUTING)
- Come on, get off!

15:59.893 --> 16:01.531
ROBIN: Get off of there, Spar!

16:02.128 --> 16:03.607
MAN: We love you, Spar!

16:05.231 --> 16:09.475
Come on! Come down, Spar!
Come on down!

16:09.569 --> 16:11.776
Come on, honey, come down for us!

16:13.540 --> 16:15.383
Come on, get down, Spar! Get down!

16:15.508 --> 16:17.510
Come on, Spar! Come on, come on!

16:17.644 --> 16:19.954
Get down off the rock, Spar!

16:20.046 --> 16:21.525
Come on down!

16:23.583 --> 16:25.119
Come on, hotshot, come on!

16:27.220 --> 16:30.895
Would you just do what's good for you?
Will you listen and get off the rock?

16:31.024 --> 16:34.005
Would you just listen sometimes
and do what's good for you?

16:34.094 --> 16:36.665
- Come on, Spar! Come on!
- You're an animal! You can't do this to me!

16:36.763 --> 16:38.299
Come on, baby!

16:38.398 --> 16:40.036
That's it! That's it, that's it!
Go, go there!

16:40.166 --> 16:41.804
BENJAMIN: Get off the rocks!
Get off the rocks!

16:41.901 --> 16:43.312
(ALL CHEERING)

16:43.403 --> 16:44.711
Do you think I want to do this by myself?

16:44.838 --> 16:46.078
Do you think I want to come out here

16:46.206 --> 16:47.742
and drag you out here?

16:47.874 --> 16:49.820
I did it because I was desperate!

17:08.027 --> 17:09.097
Benjamin?

17:09.229 --> 17:12.108
Hey, look, I'm feelin'
a real lack of privacy right now.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.108
Like, maybe we're all a bit
in each other's pockets.

17:14.233 --> 17:15.941
Can't you see his legs?
He's suffering, man.

17:16.069 --> 17:18.446
He's in a lot of pain.
I can't stand to watch it.

17:18.570 --> 17:20.778
- I know him. I see it.
- Yeah, I mean, I know him.

17:20.906 --> 17:22.511
Hey! Hey.

17:22.608 --> 17:24.349
He's in so much pain.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.720
They can't tell you, but they show you.
You know, they show you.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.850
Well, hang on.
What is all the cheering about, then?

17:28.948 --> 17:30.427
- He's okay.
- It's going to happen.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.585
He's better.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.095
It's going to happen.

17:33.219 --> 17:35.130
- Don't repeat it to me like I'm a kid.
- It's going to happen.

17:35.255 --> 17:38.532
You've never done this before!
You don't know how this goes!

17:38.625 --> 17:40.229
I know exactly how this goes.

17:40.326 --> 17:42.636
And I invite you to
tell me about that sometime.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.105
But this is a rookie mistake.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.538
I've been with him for 13 years.

17:46.132 --> 17:47.770
You can't see how selfish this is,

17:47.901 --> 17:50.108
to extend this?
Come on, you're too smart not to.

17:50.503 --> 17:53.040
I'm saying, we just let him live
for a couple more weeks.

17:53.139 --> 17:55.244
Get him some medicine and
invest in a little bit of hope!

17:55.341 --> 17:58.686
No, I can't stand by and watch this happen!

17:58.811 --> 18:01.291
- I'm not gonna do it!
- Well, it's not up to you.

18:02.215 --> 18:03.489
It's gonna happen.

18:08.454 --> 18:09.558
Don't make me get angry.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.397
'Cause that would just
be so terrible, if you got angry.

18:11.491 --> 18:12.936
You know what the right thing to do is!

18:13.026 --> 18:14.630
I'm so disappointed in you.

18:18.464 --> 18:20.842
Well, you don't even
know me well enough to say that!

18:23.803 --> 18:26.443
Hi, Lucy.
When are you gonna have those babies?

18:28.875 --> 18:31.014
Hey, Rosie. Your dad around?

18:31.144 --> 18:33.784
He said he was goin' to think.
He does that sometimes.

18:34.314 --> 18:35.850
You guys makin' dinner?

18:36.249 --> 18:37.455
- No.
- Well, let me help you.

18:37.550 --> 18:39.530
- I'll order a pizza or something.
- No, look, it's fine.

18:39.652 --> 18:42.633
Look, Dad'll be back soon.
He's just having a mood.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.633
KELLY: Yeah? How long do those last?

18:44.724 --> 18:46.362
A couple of years.

18:53.032 --> 18:55.239
Pizza. Pizza, pizza, pizza.

18:56.269 --> 18:57.748
Smells good.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.409
- Good job.
- Thank you.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.249
- You miss Lily?
- Me?

19:05.712 --> 19:07.316
- No.
- I bet you put all your feelings

19:07.413 --> 19:09.825
- into your drawings?
- Nah, not really.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.731
I guess I just can't
talk to girls that well?

19:14.454 --> 19:17.867
Well, talkin' to girls is easy.
They'll tell you everything.

19:17.957 --> 19:20.369
The secret to talking is listening.

20:17.517 --> 20:19.963
I thought if I came out here it would stop.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.532
Back home, every place
reminded me of her.

20:29.295 --> 20:33.072
Filippe's on Third Street. Balboa Park.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.781
Little Dom's, the coffee shop,
that... That's a big one.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.115
I mean, the air,
the way it smelled in May and August,

20:40.306 --> 20:41.478
because those were the months that her

20:41.607 --> 20:44.315
favorite bushes grew flowers
all over our neighborhood.

20:45.111 --> 20:47.022
They're all triggers, man.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.459
And it got better for a while.

20:49.549 --> 20:52.120
I mean, it... It did, out here.

20:54.153 --> 20:56.190
But the funny thing is that

20:57.056 --> 20:59.297
it just turns out that she's here, too.

21:00.226 --> 21:03.366
I mean, I go to Home Depot.
I go to the nine-miles-away Target.

21:03.529 --> 21:04.633
We need a new store.

21:04.731 --> 21:05.903
(BOTH LAUGHING)

21:06.499 --> 21:09.207
And seriously, I'm
avoiding half the aisles.

21:09.335 --> 21:10.712
Condiments.

21:11.337 --> 21:13.339
Pastries, forget about it.

21:13.473 --> 21:17.615
She loved red kites
and blueberry Pop-Tarts.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.348
I mean, who doesn't, right?

21:19.479 --> 21:20.514
Who doesn't?

21:24.384 --> 21:28.059
If only I could talk to her
about getting over her.

21:30.423 --> 21:31.834
Yeah.

21:33.726 --> 21:36.900
And most of all, it's the kids.
They're the biggest triggers of all.

21:37.597 --> 21:40.134
BENJAMIN: I mean, Dylan. His eyes.

21:40.233 --> 21:42.804
You know, I've only seen
that expression in somebody's eyes

21:42.902 --> 21:44.813
once in my life.

21:44.904 --> 21:48.875
And the way he just drives me nuts,
he makes me crazy.

21:49.008 --> 21:51.181
Denies me, frustrates me.

21:51.277 --> 21:55.748
And all the time,
he's looking back at me with her eyes.

21:58.184 --> 22:00.061
And none of her lightness.

22:04.257 --> 22:09.536
What I've figured out is that
when you love somebody that much,

22:09.629 --> 22:12.235
that hard, that long,

22:14.133 --> 22:16.909
you can never get away from them,
no matter where you go.

22:17.737 --> 22:19.080
And that only comes

22:20.873 --> 22:22.284
once in a lifetime.

22:28.581 --> 22:30.754
Just can't get a handle on it.

22:35.455 --> 22:37.196
I cannot let go.

22:46.632 --> 22:48.111
I can.

22:49.769 --> 22:52.443
Sleep well, Benjamin. Sweet dreams.

22:59.979 --> 23:03.586
I get it now, okay?
I get why you can't stand me!

23:03.950 --> 23:05.896
Okay. All right.

23:05.985 --> 23:09.125
No. At least now I know the real reason
why you hate me!

23:09.255 --> 23:10.757
Look, I heard you admit it to her.

23:11.190 --> 23:13.830
Like you were talking about cornflakes.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.132
You hate me!

23:15.261 --> 23:17.901
I hate you? Wait a second.

23:17.997 --> 23:20.807
Okay, we've had some problems, man,
but we're figurin' it out, okay?

23:20.933 --> 23:22.435
That is bullshit!

23:22.535 --> 23:25.141
Admit it! You wish I wasn't here!

23:25.271 --> 23:27.342
With that expression in my eyes?

23:27.473 --> 23:28.816
I heard you!

23:28.941 --> 23:31.387
Hold on! Enough with the drama! All right?

23:31.844 --> 23:33.482
Knock it off! You misheard me!

23:33.579 --> 23:35.581
I can't stand it here!
Look, can't you see that?

23:35.681 --> 23:37.922
No, but thank you for telling me, again!

23:38.618 --> 23:40.495
I keep forgetting! it's all about you!

23:40.620 --> 23:43.362
Why don't I just pack us up?
We'll just go on the road together.

23:43.489 --> 23:44.627
We could be hobos.

23:44.724 --> 23:46.533
Because you wasted all our money!

23:46.659 --> 23:48.332
Some of that belonged to me, Dad!

23:48.494 --> 23:51.338
I didn't waste our money.
I thought you liked it here.

23:52.231 --> 23:54.643
And I'm sorry, I thought your friends
would come out and visit you, man.

23:54.734 --> 23:57.510
I called them all myself and I invited 'em.

23:57.637 --> 24:00.208
And I'm sorry,
I thought you and Lily were friends.

24:00.339 --> 24:01.545
I thought, I thought, I thought...

24:01.674 --> 24:03.051
I thought this was...

24:03.175 --> 24:04.210
I mean, I thought you liked me!

24:04.343 --> 24:05.651
I thought this was
a dream come true for us!

24:05.745 --> 24:07.486
It's your dream!

24:07.580 --> 24:09.787
You can't force a dream
onto someone else, Dad!

24:09.882 --> 24:10.860
Yes, I can!

24:10.983 --> 24:12.621
- I can force a dream on you!
- Why are you yelling?

24:12.718 --> 24:14.459
Because it's a good dream!

24:14.554 --> 24:17.330
And it's got cool animals in it
and some pretty great people, too!

24:17.990 --> 24:20.300
And because I'm your father
and I'm the only one you've got!

24:20.393 --> 24:24.864
And the line of people in this world
who really care about you ends here!

24:24.997 --> 24:28.001
So stop moping around this place, man!

24:28.100 --> 24:30.376
And pick up a shovel and dig a hole!

24:30.903 --> 24:32.382
Do something!

24:32.505 --> 24:34.143
You just sit here
and feel sorry for yourself, man!

24:34.240 --> 24:35.651
Help me with your sister!

24:35.741 --> 24:38.654
- Help me, damn it!
- Help me, damn it! Help me!

24:44.550 --> 24:45.722
(SIGHS)

24:50.222 --> 24:53.760
I'm sorry that your mother
got sick when she did.

24:54.293 --> 24:55.704
Believe me.

24:59.332 --> 25:02.779
I'm sorry that you didn't get
more of a childhood, man.

25:04.103 --> 25:06.310
That's just how that one went.

25:07.807 --> 25:12.256
But we live with a seven-year-old girl
who still believes in the Easter Bunny.

25:16.616 --> 25:18.391
What are we gonna do?

25:19.819 --> 25:21.321
You never ask me how I'm doin'.

25:22.188 --> 25:24.725
You never even taught me how to shave.

25:25.157 --> 25:26.932
What, you want to know how to shave?

25:29.362 --> 25:31.968
I would love to teach you how to shave!

25:32.665 --> 25:34.110
Let's shave!

25:37.903 --> 25:40.008
What about the Easter Bunny?

26:16.409 --> 26:18.013
Is it time?

26:57.483 --> 26:59.224
What happened with you and Lily?

26:59.952 --> 27:01.397
I don't know.

27:02.988 --> 27:06.800
I guess I didn't listen to something
she told me or somethin'?

27:07.426 --> 27:09.133
I mean, I liked her.

27:10.262 --> 27:13.607
It's like you embarrass yourself
if you say something,

27:14.467 --> 27:16.538
and you embarrass yourself if you don't.

27:17.203 --> 27:18.580
(CHUCKLING)

27:23.943 --> 27:25.889
I like it when you talk.

27:28.314 --> 27:35.129
You know, sometimes all you need
is 20 seconds of insane courage.

27:35.254 --> 27:39.896
Just, literally 20 seconds
of just embarrassing bravery.

27:40.459 --> 27:44.930
And I promise you,
something great will come of it.

27:55.808 --> 27:58.118
I never know what to say to you.

28:04.383 --> 28:06.021
I'm the same way.

28:12.291 --> 28:15.670
Why don't we just tell each other
what we wish the other guy would say?

28:18.297 --> 28:20.709
"I'm sorry I brought you
out to the sticks."

28:20.833 --> 28:22.779

Two hundred pounds' worth.

35:00.966 --> 35:02.775
- For Bruno.
- Buster.

35:02.901 --> 35:04.107
Whatever.

35:04.236 --> 35:05.943
- Are you serious?
- No.

35:06.071 --> 35:09.382
Serious is the smell in that car.

35:09.474 --> 35:13.251
I started questioning my entire being
back there on the 405.

35:13.345 --> 35:18.658
It was like <i>Altered States.</i>
I saw an iguana and a dwarf Indian.

35:19.451 --> 35:20.589
Aw, Dunc.

35:20.686 --> 35:24.293
All right. Come on.
Got an inspection tomorrow.

35:25.924 --> 35:28.302

That defeats its own purpose!

35:48.280 --> 35:49.884
What you got her painting there, Rosie?

35:49.982 --> 35:50.983
ROSIE: Ladybugs.

35:52.017 --> 35:53.018
Wait.

35:56.722 --> 35:59.259
Behold, Mac. Our new logo.

36:00.325 --> 36:02.464
- You got it?
- Yeah. It fits.

36:02.861 --> 36:05.705
- Now it's official.
- Love our logo, she's a beaut.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.311
- Did I look like that?
- Worse.

36:16.441 --> 36:20.355
Wow. it's humiliating.
You seem really calm.

36:20.479 --> 36:23.983
- Have you been drinking?
- All night long.

36:24.116 --> 36:26.153
- Thanks for that.
- Any time.

36:27.219 --> 36:28.425
BENJAMIN: Okay.

36:28.520 --> 36:29.999
Well, this is it.

36:30.122 --> 36:32.602
I want everyone to stay off their walkies.

36:32.691 --> 36:35.137
If anybody has any problem,
I don't want to hear about it

36:35.227 --> 36:38.003
until after Walter Ferris is gone. Got it?

36:39.498 --> 36:41.068
All right, here we go.

36:41.166 --> 36:42.611
Here's to us.

36:49.875 --> 36:53.288
Mr. Ferris. Welcome back to
the Rosemoor Animal Park Adventure.

36:54.112 --> 36:56.023
It's an adventure now?

36:56.148 --> 36:58.128
Well, to be precise, sir,

36:58.216 --> 37:00.253
it always was.

37:02.654 --> 37:04.998
- Hello, MacCready.
- Hello.

37:08.193 --> 37:10.673
- How are you?
- MACCREADY: On my best behavior.

37:12.631 --> 37:14.008
I like the jumpsuit.

37:14.132 --> 37:16.373
- Love the tie.
- Thank you.

37:20.605 --> 37:21.879
ROSIE: Wait for me, Dad.

37:24.343 --> 37:26.448
Well, that's one way to do it.

37:35.087 --> 37:36.498
Moist.

38:40.051 --> 38:41.553
Oh, God.

KELLY: <i>MacCready, I would love it
if you could come and meet me</i>

38:56.001 --> 38:58.072
<i>by Solomon's enclosure. Bye.</i>

39:00.338 --> 39:02.011
Let's go see Solomon's enclosure.

39:07.546 --> 39:09.219
We're sunk. We're doomed.

39:15.187 --> 39:18.191
Come, MacCready, please come, please.

39:18.290 --> 39:20.065
Thank God you're here.

39:20.192 --> 39:21.762
I asked you so politely,
I didn't think you'd come.

39:21.893 --> 39:23.702
And that's why I came.
You're never that polite. What's up?

39:23.795 --> 39:26.036
The lock is broken
and I feel like the only way...

39:26.131 --> 39:28.168
Oh, God, the only way to fix it
is to jimmy it from the inside.

39:30.936 --> 39:31.914
MACCREADY: I made this lock.

39:32.003 --> 39:33.949
- We're going to fail this inspection.
- We're not gonna fail it.

39:34.039 --> 39:35.143
- You're going to calm down.
- Yes, I am.

39:35.240 --> 39:36.275
What are you gonna do to help?

39:36.408 --> 39:38.183
I'm gonna distract him
from the other side of this enclosure

39:38.276 --> 39:40.051
and you're gonna not get eaten!

39:43.448 --> 39:45.394
All right, it's gonna be fine.

39:47.586 --> 39:48.758
Okay.

Hey, hey, Solomon!
Who's a handsome boy?

39:52.457 --> 39:55.995
Come on, Solomon. Come on, baby!
Over here.

39:56.094 --> 39:59.075
Ooh! Hey!

40:01.766 --> 40:03.370
Come on, Solomon, come on, baby!

40:04.536 --> 40:06.709
- Hey, do you want somethin' to drink?
- I don't drink.

40:06.805 --> 40:07.875
Well, not even water?

40:07.973 --> 40:09.782
Do you have any idea
what they put in water?

40:10.575 --> 40:13.055
KELLY: Over here.

40:13.144 --> 40:16.717
Hey, good boy, good Solomon!
Good Solomon! Good boy! Good boy!

40:19.985 --> 40:23.262
Who's a handsome boy? Keep working!
Hurry up! Would you hurry up?

40:23.388 --> 40:25.368
I can only keep his attention for so long!

40:25.457 --> 40:27.698
Hi, boy! Hi, boy!
Fix it, fix it, would you?

40:27.792 --> 40:29.738

You don't want me!

40:50.448 --> 40:54.055
I am filled with Scotch and bitterness
and impure thoughts!

40:56.221 --> 40:58.428

41:44.869 --> 41:46.507
Everybody says you're a dick.

41:47.772 --> 41:51.345
I don't know what that means,
but I don't believe it.

42:03.455 --> 42:05.093
I don't think it's gonna work.

42:14.666 --> 42:15.667
But good luck.

- What?

43:07.185 --> 43:10.189
What happens if literally
we did this whole thing for nothing?

43:10.922 --> 43:14.267
Come on, give me a break.
You've come this far. Huh?

people and animals, really quick,

53:09.053 --> 53:10.430
how would you choose?

53:10.554 --> 53:11.931
BENJAMIN: I want to get a shot of that.

53:12.056 --> 53:13.262
ROSIE: I'll get a close-up on your nose.

53:21.632 --> 53:23.043
Me, too.

53:23.601 --> 53:25.512
People!

55:00.064 --> 55:02.010
- All right. Ladies first.
- Where are we going?

55:05.302 --> 55:08.681
Now, hang on. So, okay. Stop.

55:08.773 --> 55:10.184
She was

55:11.041 --> 55:12.019
right there.

55:12.109 --> 55:16.683
This is the moment where both of you
became a possibility.

55:16.781 --> 55:18.852
I love that you're telling stories again.

55:18.949 --> 55:21.657
This is the story before the story.

55:21.752 --> 55:25.666
This is where you and you begin.

55:25.756 --> 55:28.828
Because this is where I met your mom.

55:29.293 --> 55:32.331
She was sitting right there in that chair.

55:36.200 --> 55:37.577
Hang on.

55:43.307 --> 55:44.786
Hey, hey. So,

55:44.909 --> 55:46.286
I was walkin' by.

55:48.879 --> 55:52.952
And I saw her and I literally stopped,
like this, just stopped.

55:53.083 --> 55:55.791
And went, "Oh, my God."

55:55.920 --> 55:59.925
"That is the most beautiful woman
I have ever seen in my entire life."

56:00.057 --> 56:01.434
But I've never done anything like this.

56:01.559 --> 56:04.369
I'd never gone and talked
to a total stranger before.

56:04.462 --> 56:06.703
But she was right there.

56:06.797 --> 56:11.075
And so I thought to myself,
"20 seconds." Right?

56:12.336 --> 56:13.747
Go.

56:18.509 --> 56:22.116
Now I'm in the restaurant.
And I'm terrified.

56:22.680 --> 56:24.091
Thinkin' about leaving.

56:24.181 --> 56:26.787
I can actually touch her.
She's right there.

56:26.917 --> 56:28.590
She still hasn't seen me.

56:28.686 --> 56:30.324
And I still have 15
seconds of courage left.

56:30.988 --> 56:32.399
I'm goin' for it.

56:33.757 --> 56:35.134
Bravery.

56:35.559 --> 56:37.561
Here's what I said.

56:45.002 --> 56:46.413
What?

56:47.638 --> 56:48.708
(SIGHS)

56:49.907 --> 56:51.580
I said,

56:52.743 --> 56:54.745
"Excuse me."

57:16.033 --> 57:17.444
Hi, Mom.

57:17.535 --> 57:19.014
Hi, Mommy.

57:27.044 --> 57:30.514
"Why would an amazing woman like you"

57:30.648 --> 57:33.993
"even talk to someone like me?"

57:40.658 --> 57:41.898
(CHUCKLES)

57:42.493 --> 57:43.904
Why not?
