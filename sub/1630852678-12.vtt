- That's how I feel about me
and Preston.

32:48.969 --> 32:52.072
It's a lot.

32:52.172 --> 32:56.043
- Well...no, no, no, you let
that one go.

32:56.143 --> 32:58.478
- Excuse me?

32:58.579 --> 33:00.113
- He's a good man.

33:00.214 --> 33:04.651
- So? He doesn't understand me.
We don't have enough in common.

33:04.751 --> 33:06.587
- Okay.

33:06.687 --> 33:08.922
- All right, and I didn't
let anything go.

33:09.022 --> 33:12.659
I...it takes two to tango
first of all.

33:12.759 --> 33:14.595
But I'm stepping back from it,
you know,

33:14.695 --> 33:16.897
giving it some room to breathe

33:16.997 --> 33:19.032
- Yeah, okay, you messed
that one up.

33:19.132 --> 33:20.834
- Okay, I won't expect you
to understand.

33:20.934 --> 33:22.069
You don't have healthy
boundaries seeing as how

33:22.169 --> 33:24.204
you just walked in my door.
How can I help you?

33:24.304 --> 33:26.106
Did you come to aggravate me.
- I have your keys! No.

33:26.206 --> 33:27.975
And I was just trying to tell
you that you were right

33:28.075 --> 33:29.176
I know how much you love
hearing that.

33:29.276 --> 33:31.578
That's it, my work is done.
- Okay.

33:31.678 --> 33:34.081
- I'm going to work now.
- See you later.

33:34.181 --> 33:36.149
- I will see you later.
- DANNI: Oh, wait.

33:36.250 --> 33:37.317
- Hm?
- We gotta go to

33:37.417 --> 33:39.887
Andi's for lunch.
We need to talk about Karen.

33:39.987 --> 33:44.358
- Is she okay?
- No, she's not great.

33:44.458 --> 33:46.393
- Zac?
- Yeah.

33:46.493 --> 33:47.561
- SABRINA: Okay.
- Okay.

33:47.661 --> 33:48.562
- SABRINA: Okay.
- All right.

33:48.662 --> 33:49.796
- All right.
- See you later.

33:49.897 --> 33:52.566
- I'll talk to you later.
- I like your boots.

33:52.666 --> 33:54.134
- SABRINA: Thank you!

33:54.234 --> 33:55.636
- I'ma take 'em.

34:04.912 --> 34:09.049
- [knocking]
- Come in.

34:09.149 --> 34:11.885
- Hey.
- What's up?

34:11.985 --> 34:14.454
- How are you?
- I'm good. How you doing?

34:14.555 --> 34:18.025
- Chilling.
Sup?

34:18.125 --> 34:20.027
- Like the place.

34:20.127 --> 34:21.328
- It's coming together nice,
right?

34:21.428 --> 34:22.796
- Yeah, this is real nice.

34:22.896 --> 34:27.267
- You see that?
It's called a sconce.

34:27.367 --> 34:29.903
You ever seen a sconce
before?

34:30.003 --> 34:31.505
- No.

34:31.605 --> 34:34.408
- Stick with me, baby.
I'll keep you cultured.

34:34.508 --> 34:37.311
- Yeah, those are pretty modern,
but I like the ones

34:37.411 --> 34:41.081
from the Baroque period.

34:41.181 --> 34:44.451
- You know about sconces?
- Yeah.

34:44.551 --> 34:49.022
- You right. You white.
You would know what a sconce is.

34:49.122 --> 34:50.724
- Really?
- What's up?

34:50.824 --> 34:52.059
Come on, man.

34:52.159 --> 34:54.261
- Look, you need some help?

34:54.361 --> 34:57.030
- Uh, duh, I'm trying to
move in here. What's up?

34:57.130 --> 34:59.733
- What you need me to do?

34:59.833 --> 35:02.736
- Look, look, look.
Look how the tables have turned.

35:02.836 --> 35:05.339
You knocking on my door.
I know you ain't come by here

35:05.439 --> 35:08.809
to help me with no boxes.
- No, look, I did, I did.

35:08.909 --> 35:10.277
- It's Danni, huh?

35:10.377 --> 35:13.380
- No, it's not Danni.

35:13.480 --> 35:15.649
- Look at your face.
It's...you can't even lie.

35:15.749 --> 35:18.418
Lies is coming out your eyes.
What's up? What's up?

35:18.519 --> 35:20.721
Talk to me. You been doing what
I told you to do, right?

35:20.821 --> 35:24.858
- Yeah, I have.
And so far...

35:24.958 --> 35:27.327
- What? So far what?

35:27.427 --> 35:30.564
- I really think it's just
been making her mad.

35:30.664 --> 35:33.300
- So? What's the problem?

35:33.400 --> 35:34.868
She's supposed to be mad.

35:34.968 --> 35:37.771
She's supposed to realize you
got mad options.

35:37.871 --> 35:40.674
- I don't know, Zac.
Danni doesn't seem to be moved

35:40.774 --> 35:43.810
by this stuff at all.
- You see, that's your problem.

35:43.911 --> 35:46.747
You care too much
what Danni is moved by.

35:46.847 --> 35:48.815
Look at your face.
You come in here frowning,

35:48.916 --> 35:51.518
talking about sconces.
Come on, bro.

35:51.618 --> 35:54.521
She gotta know you got moves.
And you willing to use

35:54.621 --> 35:56.623
those moves on other chicks
It's that simple, bro.

35:56.723 --> 35:58.091
- Yeah, but I feel bad.

35:58.192 --> 36:00.427
I mean, they're really
nice girls, but all I'm doing

36:00.527 --> 36:03.163
is using 'em when I want
Danni.

36:03.263 --> 36:04.731
- That's fair.
That's...that's fair

36:04.831 --> 36:06.667
I don't want you to
use no girls.

36:06.767 --> 36:09.870
- On top of all that,
Karen was on to me.

36:12.172 --> 36:13.407
- That's my fault,
I shoulda...

36:13.507 --> 36:15.108
Karen gonna be on you.
One thing Karen...

36:15.209 --> 36:16.510
- [knocking]

36:16.610 --> 36:19.413
- Come in.
Karen gonna be on you for sure.

36:19.513 --> 36:20.881
- Yeah.
- Shit.

36:20.981 --> 36:23.750
- You seen me, right?
I thought you was the movers.

36:23.851 --> 36:25.252
- They coming today?
- Yeah.

36:25.352 --> 36:28.188
This is...oh, this is Preston.
- Hey.

36:28.288 --> 36:29.957
- Hey.
- This is Jake.

36:30.057 --> 36:32.626
- Look, I'm gonna get some of
these boxes moved.

36:32.726 --> 36:35.262
It was good to meet you.
- You, too.

36:35.362 --> 36:37.197
- Watch my...watch my...
stay off here.

36:37.297 --> 36:40.400
Fragile.
Spend money on this.

36:40.501 --> 36:43.604
Ain't a cow.

36:43.704 --> 36:45.372
- This place is really
coming together.

36:45.472 --> 36:47.641
- It is, right?

36:47.741 --> 36:49.576
You half white.
You know what a sconce is?

36:49.676 --> 36:51.912
- Man, you gonna stop
that shit.

36:52.012 --> 36:53.780
- You don't know what
a sconce is.

36:53.881 --> 36:57.050
- So, uh, how'd last night go?

36:57.150 --> 36:58.485
- It was fine.

36:58.585 --> 37:00.487
- Did you tell her?

37:00.587 --> 37:02.022
- Yeah, I told her.

37:04.324 --> 37:07.160
- She was cool with it?

37:07.261 --> 37:10.531
- Bro, I told you yesterday.
It's easy with Fatima

37:10.631 --> 37:13.300
as long as I'm honest
and upfront,

37:13.400 --> 37:17.004
everything be smooth.
Told you, bro.

37:17.104 --> 37:19.940
- We gotta all hang out.

37:20.040 --> 37:21.575
- We...we...we who?

37:21.675 --> 37:23.577
- Me, you, her, and my girl.

37:23.677 --> 37:25.579
Maybe some of that will
rub off on my lady.

37:25.679 --> 37:27.414
- Oh, you said your girl.
You're lucky.

37:27.514 --> 37:29.183
I got nervous for a minute.
- [laughter]

37:29.283 --> 37:31.652
- Nah, if only it worked
that way.

37:31.752 --> 37:33.387
Every man should be so lucky.

37:33.487 --> 37:35.355
- Yeah, you're right about
that.

37:35.455 --> 37:37.758
- What brings you by?

37:37.858 --> 37:40.594
- What are you talking about?
We got our lesson today.

37:40.694 --> 37:44.264
- A what?
- About the SEC and Bolinesta.

37:44.364 --> 37:46.700
I gotta fill you in on all...

37:46.800 --> 37:48.635
Bro, we just talked about
this last night.

37:48.735 --> 37:51.872
- My bad, father.
My bad.

37:51.972 --> 37:54.608
I was working all last night.
I didn't get no sleep.

37:54.708 --> 37:56.777
- Look, I hear you.
- ZAC: Cut me a break.

37:56.877 --> 38:00.080
- I mean, you wanna do it now?
I can come back after lunch.

38:00.180 --> 38:03.884
- I got Preston upstair...

38:03.984 --> 38:06.753
All right, all right, um,
you know, let's just do it now.

38:06.854 --> 38:08.522
I don't wanna wait.
Just do it now.

38:08.622 --> 38:10.257
- Okay.

38:10.357 --> 38:12.726
- You really think the SEC
gonna be on me like that?

38:12.826 --> 38:15.662
- Look, you can never be
100% sure,

38:15.762 --> 38:18.365
but it's better to be safe
than sorry.

38:18.465 --> 38:22.035
- All right.
Um, where do we start?

38:22.135 --> 38:24.738
- I got a bunch of charts,
files, and stuff we'll go over.

38:24.838 --> 38:26.073
- Charts?
You sound like a teacher.

38:26.173 --> 38:28.275
- It'll be all right, man.
Calm your ass down.

38:28.375 --> 38:29.977
- Fine, fine.
Let me...let me put

38:30.077 --> 38:32.179
this stuff back, 'cause I'm
trying to look at my...

38:32.279 --> 38:34.114
do you see these jars?
- Yeah, man. Come on.

38:34.214 --> 38:36.884
- These are imported.
- Yeah, I know. Let's roll.

38:36.984 --> 38:38.318
- From Buckhead.

38:45.526 --> 38:51.732

38:51.932 --> 38:54.535
- Hey.

38:54.635 --> 38:56.570
- What?
- I need to talk to you.

38:56.670 --> 38:59.973
- No, you don't.
- Actually, I do.

39:00.073 --> 39:02.709
- Well, if I stand here,
the first words that better

39:02.809 --> 39:05.312
fall from your lips better
be, I'm sorry.

39:05.412 --> 39:06.914
- What?
- Yes.

39:07.014 --> 39:10.417

a favor last night, right?

39:10.517 --> 39:11.919
- Oh yeah, how?

39:12.019 --> 39:14.721
- You know all your ranting
and raving with the bat?

39:14.821 --> 39:17.558
Yeah, I got all that on video.

39:17.658 --> 39:19.293
- Good for you, --.
What you want, a cookie?

39:19.393 --> 39:20.727

great, actually.

39:20.827 --> 39:22.129
- Yeah, keep it up, Hayden.

39:22.229 --> 39:24.798
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where you think you're going?

39:24.898 --> 39:28.101
- To work.
- No, no you're not.

39:28.202 --> 39:31.138
- Okay, so you wanna tell me
where I am going?

39:31.238 --> 39:33.006
- With those men.

39:33.106 --> 39:35.943
- [laughs] Oh, so you're
having me arrested?

39:36.043 --> 39:38.812
- Oh, yeah. Yeah,
I'm pressing major charges.

39:38.912 --> 39:40.414
- Okay.
- And I'm gonna get

39:40.514 --> 39:42.683
a restraining order.
- Okay.

39:42.783 --> 39:45.252
- And I'm definitely getting
your ass fired.

39:45.352 --> 39:46.620
- You do you.

39:46.720 --> 39:48.589
- See, how can we work in
the same building

39:48.689 --> 39:50.624
if you can't be within
50 feet of me?

39:50.724 --> 39:53.093
- Hmm.
Why do I feel like there's

39:53.193 --> 39:56.029
an unless coming?
- What do you mean?

39:56.129 --> 39:58.465
- I'm gonna do all this
unless you...

39:58.565 --> 40:01.401
- Oh, nah.
There's no unless.

40:01.502 --> 40:03.904
I"m just gonna show you how
the legal system works.

40:04.004 --> 40:05.205
- Okay.

40:05.305 --> 40:07.674
- See, you can't do all the
shit that you do and just

40:07.774 --> 40:09.209

40:09.309 --> 40:11.678
What you gonna do all this
hood shit, sleep with all these

40:11.778 --> 40:16.550
hood ass --, not gonna

You see, you in my world now.

40:22.256 --> 40:24.825
So, I'm gonna show you how
the justice system works

40:24.925 --> 40:27.828

- Mm-hmm.

40:29.463 --> 40:30.797
- All right.

40:30.898 --> 40:32.666
- It's a nice dress by the way.

40:45.445 --> 40:47.314
- Well, you may wanna look
into getting a new assistant.

40:47.414 --> 40:50.317
- Why?
- Your girl Fatima's in jail.

40:50.417 --> 40:52.152
- Girl, who they from?
- NARRATOR: Next on "Sistas".

40:52.252 --> 40:53.820
- Where do you want them?
- How many are there?

40:53.921 --> 40:56.156
- There's a truck outside.
It's full of them.

40:56.256 --> 40:59.593
- What?
- Nice flowers. Who they from?

40:59.693 --> 41:01.595
- So you don't think he's
staying here?

41:01.695 --> 41:03.597
- No, I don't think that's
happening at all,

41:03.697 --> 41:05.265
just like Paris was
there last night.

41:05.365 --> 41:07.768
- I need a sweep of my
new apartment.

41:07.868 --> 41:09.570
Check for cameras, bugs.

41:09.670 --> 41:11.338
- Yeah, we do that all day.
- ANDI: Good.

41:11.438 --> 41:13.707
- This man, he will be an
amazing father.

41:13.807 --> 41:55.482
- Ah.
