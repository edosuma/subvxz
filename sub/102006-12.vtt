00:01.479 --> 00:02.524
[whoosh]

00:02.698 --> 00:04.004
All you got to do is hang on.

00:04.221 --> 00:05.440
Push through the pain.

00:05.570 --> 00:08.486
[screaming]

00:08.617 --> 00:10.488
ANNOUNCER: "911,"
all-new Mondays.

00:10.619 --> 00:13.665
And watch other Fox shows like
"Lone Star," "Prodigal Son,"

00:13.839 --> 00:15.189
and "The Resident" on Fox.

00:15.319 --> 00:15.885
[whoosh]

00:19.280 --> 00:20.194
â™ª

00:20.324 --> 00:21.760
[bird screeches]

00:27.984 --> 00:30.421
Check it out! This one's
called "Artemisia californica."

00:30.552 --> 00:32.902
[panting]

00:33.033 --> 00:34.947
-Sagebrush.
-I liked it better

00:35.078 --> 00:36.732
when you knew the names
of dolls.

00:36.862 --> 00:39.256
Dad, I never played with dolls.

00:43.565 --> 00:46.263
[panting]

00:46.350 --> 00:49.092
FRED:
Ooh!

00:50.572 --> 00:54.097
[panting]

00:54.228 --> 00:57.144
Emma? Where'd you go?

00:57.318 --> 00:59.624
Can you believe this?

01:02.323 --> 01:04.238
Oh, what you got there?

01:04.412 --> 01:06.544
Dad, look.
I think there's a note inside.

01:06.675 --> 01:08.068
Oh. Okay.

01:09.373 --> 01:11.027
Oh.

01:11.158 --> 01:13.290
-Is that blood?
-[panting]

01:15.379 --> 01:17.642
Oh, boy.

01:23.779 --> 01:24.736
Do you have
a more precise location?

01:24.910 --> 01:26.738
Uh... upstream, I think.

01:26.825 --> 01:28.958
-Tell 'em they could be up
near the headwaters, Dad.
-Yeah.

01:29.045 --> 01:30.699
They could be up
near the headwaters, but

01:30.829 --> 01:32.135
we can't see anything from here.

01:32.266 --> 01:33.919
You can't see the person? Then,

01:34.050 --> 01:36.052
what makes you think
someone's trapped?

01:38.054 --> 01:39.838
We found a message in a bottle.

01:47.063 --> 01:50.849
PILOT: Dispatch, this is Fire
Rescue One. We are on the scene.

01:51.023 --> 01:53.025
MADDIE:
Copy that, Fire One.

01:53.156 --> 01:54.766
Engine and Rescue 118
are landing now.

01:54.853 --> 01:57.595
Rangers think the bottle may
have come from the headwaters

01:57.726 --> 01:59.597
of the creek, south by southwest
of your position,

01:59.728 --> 02:00.990
near the rocks.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.861
PILOT:
Copy that, dispatch.

02:02.992 --> 02:06.082
[dog barking, sniffing]

02:06.213 --> 02:08.345
[sirens wailing]

02:17.615 --> 02:20.879
8,000 acres to search.
We could be waiting awhile.

02:21.010 --> 02:22.751
BUCK: Are they sure
someone's up there?

02:22.881 --> 02:24.535
That bottle could have been
floating around for months.

02:24.666 --> 02:26.102
HEN: Which would mean
our search and rescue

02:26.276 --> 02:28.626
might become
a search and recovery.

02:28.757 --> 02:29.975
Note was written on a receipt.

02:30.106 --> 02:31.368
Rangers checked the date.

02:31.455 --> 02:32.674
It was five days ago.

02:32.804 --> 02:35.720
Sure hope
it wasn't their last meal.

02:35.851 --> 02:39.333
PILOT: We see you, Captain Nash.
We're coming in now.

02:39.463 --> 02:40.464
Copy that.

02:40.595 --> 02:42.597
Okay, Chimney, Eddie,

02:42.684 --> 02:44.294
gear up.
You're going with them.

02:44.425 --> 02:46.253
Copy that. You'll harness up,
we'll lower you down

02:46.427 --> 02:48.603
so you can grab him.

02:49.778 --> 02:51.519
Cheer up. You can go next time.

02:56.698 --> 03:00.354
BOBBY: Okay, first quadrant
is right over that ridge.

03:03.139 --> 03:04.923
Head up to Devil's Point.

03:05.054 --> 03:06.925
A lot of hikers get stuck
up there.

03:07.056 --> 03:08.405
CHIMNEY:
Copy that, Cap.

03:09.450 --> 03:11.452
Pretty sure
there's a river, too.

03:11.582 --> 03:12.888
It could be where
they threw the bottle in.

03:13.018 --> 03:15.151
EDDIE:
I think I see something.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.285
Help! Please!

03:18.415 --> 03:19.503
Down here! Help, please!

03:19.677 --> 03:21.157
CHIMNEY:
Okay, we got him.

03:21.331 --> 03:23.768
Let's get in a hover position
right here.

03:31.428 --> 03:33.517
CHIMNEY:
Looks like severe dehydration.

03:33.648 --> 03:35.693
He's gonna need this.

03:35.824 --> 03:37.826
-Ready?
-Piece of cake.

03:37.956 --> 03:40.307
PILOT: Be advised, air support
gonna maintain 50 feet.

03:40.481 --> 03:43.527
Lowering rescuer now.

03:50.534 --> 03:52.797
Rescuer at ten feet.

03:53.885 --> 03:55.017
Rescuer on the ground.

03:55.104 --> 03:57.324
I'm Eddie. What's your name?

03:57.454 --> 03:59.064
I'm Clyde.

03:59.195 --> 04:01.545
There's willow trees
around here, right?

04:01.676 --> 04:05.984
'Cause if not,
I'm gonna feel pretty dumb.

04:06.115 --> 04:07.334
-You're burning up.
-[groans]

04:07.508 --> 04:10.162
Drink this.
It's got electrolytes.

04:10.293 --> 04:12.339
How long have you been up here,
Clyde?

04:12.513 --> 04:13.557
Five days, maybe?

04:13.731 --> 04:15.559
I'm not sure.
[pained groaning]

04:15.733 --> 04:18.693
I was trying to get high enough
to look around,

04:18.823 --> 04:20.085
and then I fell.

04:20.216 --> 04:21.957
I thought
I could tough it out,

04:22.087 --> 04:25.221
but I ran out
of food and water.

04:25.352 --> 04:27.136
-Yup. Looks like you broke it.
-[groans]

04:27.310 --> 04:28.790
We'll get this splint on you,

04:28.964 --> 04:29.747
and we're gonna
get you out of here.

04:29.878 --> 04:31.532
No. No! No, I'm fine.

04:31.662 --> 04:33.664
Just give me some painkillers
or something.

04:33.795 --> 04:36.319
I got a couple more spots
I got to check out, and

04:36.450 --> 04:38.452
I can just ride it out
until I'm done here.

04:38.582 --> 04:41.237
That's a negative, Clyde.
Chim, prep fluids.

04:41.411 --> 04:43.108
-Our guy's gonna need it.
-Oh, man.

04:43.239 --> 04:45.589
-Sir, let's get this on you.
-[grunts]

04:45.676 --> 04:48.505
-We're gonna ride up together.
-[grunts loudly]

04:48.592 --> 04:50.028
Oh, thanks.

04:50.159 --> 04:51.726
CHIMNEY: That's our cue.
Hold steady, Fire One.

04:51.813 --> 04:53.728
I'm bringing him up.

04:59.603 --> 05:03.390
All right, buddy.
We got you. We got you.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.484
PILOT:
Dispatch, all souls on board.

05:10.614 --> 05:12.312
Returning to base.

05:18.840 --> 05:22.234
Careful! He's kind of delirious.
Been out there awhile.

05:22.365 --> 05:25.020
-[groans]
-Said he injured himself
three days ago.

05:25.150 --> 05:28.066
I'm fine. I just want to know
when I can get back up there.

05:28.197 --> 05:29.503
Definitely not today.

05:29.633 --> 05:31.722
Do you have a cell phone?

05:31.853 --> 05:33.289
-Doesn't everyone?
-HEN: Yes.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.291
But most people use it
to call for help

05:35.465 --> 05:37.075
instead of putting a message
in a bottle.

05:37.206 --> 05:39.251
Battery died yesterday.

05:39.382 --> 05:40.992
That was two days after
you injured yourself.

05:41.123 --> 05:43.038
I didn't want to leave.

05:43.168 --> 05:45.083
I was so close.

05:45.214 --> 05:47.303
I didn't want anyone else
to find the treasure.

05:47.477 --> 05:51.438
It's mine!
The treasure's mine!

05:51.568 --> 05:53.178
Don't tell anyone!

05:53.309 --> 05:55.311
Don't let anyone take it.

05:55.442 --> 05:56.791
It's mine!

05:56.878 --> 05:58.967
The treasure's mine!

05:59.968 --> 06:01.883
Did he say "treasure"?

06:02.013 --> 06:03.841
NEWSMAN: This is Channel 8
with breaking news.

06:03.972 --> 06:06.714
TAYLOR: Hollis Harcourt, the
author of such cult classics

06:06.844 --> 06:09.281
asAgony in Atwater
andBludgeoned in Burbank,

06:09.412 --> 06:12.328
passed away in his sleep
at age 57,

06:12.502 --> 06:14.852
leaving behind
an intriguing message

06:14.983 --> 06:16.985
to his loyal fans.

06:17.115 --> 06:22.382
Behold. My final gift
to the citizens of Los Angeles--

06:22.469 --> 06:25.515
a rare and priceless treasure.

06:25.646 --> 06:28.126
Though, if I had to put a price
on it for tax purposes,

06:28.300 --> 06:31.391
I'd call it about $5 million.

06:31.478 --> 06:33.262
Whoa. Five million.

06:33.349 --> 06:35.133
I'm gonna bury this chest
somewhere

06:35.307 --> 06:36.483
in the city of Los Angeles.

06:36.657 --> 06:39.007
If you are clever,
as I know you are,

06:39.137 --> 06:43.490
one of you will find this chest,
and the treasure will be yours.

06:43.577 --> 06:45.840
TAYLOR: We spoke with Harcourt's
longtime assistant,

06:45.927 --> 06:48.146
Jeremiah Ruiz, moments ago.

06:48.277 --> 06:50.671
Hollis was... passionate.

06:50.801 --> 06:52.803
He had high standards.

06:52.934 --> 06:54.849
But he was a good soul.

06:54.936 --> 06:57.939
He cared about people
and their stories.

06:58.069 --> 07:00.245
He will be missed.

07:00.376 --> 07:01.856
TAYLOR:
And he won't be forgotten.

07:01.943 --> 07:03.814
At least not any time soon.

07:03.945 --> 07:05.555
According to his final video,

07:05.686 --> 07:07.165
Hollis buried that
$5 million treasure

07:07.296 --> 07:08.863
somewhere in the city

07:08.950 --> 07:10.734
that was the setting
for most of his work.

07:10.821 --> 07:12.736
A poem he recited
in the video is said

07:12.867 --> 07:16.087
to provide all the clues needed
to locate it.

07:17.306 --> 07:19.177
CHIMNEY:
"I walked along

07:19.308 --> 07:21.484
the river's edge,
to hide my secret treasure."

07:21.615 --> 07:23.181
This poem is terrible.

07:23.355 --> 07:24.966
BOBBY:
"A heron soared,

07:25.053 --> 07:27.142
a gray bridge roared, a bullfrog
croaked 'Good measure.'"

07:27.272 --> 07:28.839
It's less of a poem,

07:28.970 --> 07:31.059
-and more of a riddle.
-Fine. It's a terrible riddle.

07:31.189 --> 07:35.193
HEN:
"I stopped beneath a willow
tree in the narrow place.

07:35.280 --> 07:39.850
And then I saw the light beam
fall upon my treasured place."

07:39.981 --> 07:42.113
You know, the guy on the cliff--
he asked me about willow trees.

07:42.287 --> 07:44.420
A real-life treasure hunt.

07:44.594 --> 07:45.769
-Wouldn't it be...?
-Dangerous.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.858
-Reckless.
-Stupid.
-Probably not even real.

07:47.989 --> 07:50.208
What if it is?

07:50.382 --> 07:52.123
How cool would it be to find it?

07:52.210 --> 07:55.779
You know, this poem-riddle thing
is getting a lot of traffic.

07:55.866 --> 07:57.085
BOBBY:
Yeah, which means
our friend Clyde is likely not

07:57.215 --> 07:58.086
the last emergency
we're gonna see

07:58.216 --> 07:59.435
from this treasure hunt.

07:59.609 --> 08:00.567
EDDIE:
Your girlfriend's news story's

08:00.741 --> 08:02.133
probably not gonna
help out with that.

08:02.220 --> 08:03.831
She's my friend,
not my girlfriend,

08:03.961 --> 08:06.137
and she's just doing her job.
Reporting the news.

08:06.224 --> 08:07.791
-Well, tell her to stop.
-[alarm rings]

08:07.878 --> 08:09.663
We got enough work without
people creating their own

08:09.793 --> 08:11.099
-emergency.
-Well, at least
it was the midday news.

08:11.229 --> 08:12.230
Maybe the whole thing dies off.

08:12.361 --> 08:15.886
Before anyone actually dies.

08:16.931 --> 08:18.889
I guess. [sighs]

08:19.020 --> 08:21.457
[phone ringing, vibrating]

08:21.588 --> 08:23.677
Uh, hey.

08:23.851 --> 08:25.766
-I just saw you on the TV.
-And I heard a rumor

08:25.896 --> 08:28.246
you guys responded to a call
about a treasure hunter

08:28.377 --> 08:29.813
-in Malibu Creek?
-Yeah.

08:29.987 --> 08:31.946
He didn't find anything, though.

08:33.382 --> 08:36.167
Not that there's anything
to find.

08:36.254 --> 08:38.779
I mean, the whole thing's
probably fake, right?

08:38.909 --> 08:40.998
I'm not so sure.
Hollis's assistant confirmed

08:41.129 --> 08:43.392
he saw the treasure himself
before Hollis died.

08:43.479 --> 08:44.611
I didn't see that part on TV.

08:44.785 --> 08:46.482
He wanted
to keep it off the record.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.484
In case this thing gets crazy,

08:48.615 --> 08:50.051
he doesn't want anyone
to come looking for him.

08:50.181 --> 08:51.182
So this is real?

08:51.356 --> 08:53.794
There's $5 million out there

08:53.924 --> 08:55.360
just-just waiting to be found?

08:55.491 --> 08:57.667
-Looks like it.
-You know, uh,

08:57.798 --> 09:00.496
I bet if we compared notes,
we could probably

09:00.627 --> 09:02.063
figure out where
he buried that treasure.

09:02.237 --> 09:03.412
You're saying
you want to team up?

09:03.543 --> 09:05.370
Look for the treasure together?

09:05.501 --> 09:07.329
We'd be, uh,
we'd be doing a public service.

09:07.416 --> 09:08.765
-Hmm.
-We find it so

09:08.852 --> 09:10.637
no one else has the chance
to get hurt.

09:10.811 --> 09:12.726
Yeah. And I mean,
clearly, it's my duty

09:12.856 --> 09:14.249
to keep the city informed.

09:14.379 --> 09:15.946
The sooner
that treasure is found,

09:16.077 --> 09:17.992
the safer the city will be.

09:18.079 --> 09:19.297
Everybody wins.

09:19.428 --> 09:21.430
Maybe not everybody.

09:31.179 --> 09:32.876
-My final gift to the citizens
of Los Angeles...
-Nuts.

09:32.963 --> 09:35.313
Please tell me
that's not porn or sports.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.012
ROMERO:
This? This is our future.
Apparently, a guy buried

09:38.186 --> 09:39.579
$5 million
somewhere in the city,

09:39.666 --> 09:42.277
then told people
to go out and find it.

09:42.364 --> 09:43.974
ATHENA:
I miss the days when
bored rich people would just

09:44.061 --> 09:46.324
name wings of museums
and hospitals after themselves.

09:46.455 --> 09:47.848
-[laughs]
-Have we had a conversation

09:48.022 --> 09:49.458
with this misguided citizen?

09:49.632 --> 09:51.808
Yeah,
that's a little hard to do.

09:51.895 --> 09:53.244
He's been dead a week.

09:53.331 --> 09:54.811
Did we post uniforms
at his grave site?

09:55.812 --> 09:58.206
You know, that's one
of the first places

09:58.293 --> 09:59.686
people are gonna start digging.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.078
Kevin, find out
where he's buried.

10:01.252 --> 10:02.602
Send some units. Thanks.

10:02.776 --> 10:04.168
[scoffs]

10:06.257 --> 10:08.129
How bad do you think
this is gonna get?

10:08.216 --> 10:11.132
Ugh. City's coming out
of a near yearlong lockdown.

10:11.262 --> 10:13.264
Everyone's still
a little stir-crazy.

10:13.351 --> 10:15.658
[chuckles]
This?

10:15.745 --> 10:18.052
This is gonna
send them over the edge.

10:18.139 --> 10:19.662
TAYLOR:
The search for Hollis Harcourt's

10:19.749 --> 10:22.230
$5 million
took another turn today

10:22.360 --> 10:25.668
in Topanga Canyon. This marks
the second serious injury

10:25.842 --> 10:27.757
in the so-called treasure hunt.

10:27.931 --> 10:29.933
With local officials reporting
that treasure hunt-related

10:30.064 --> 10:33.284
emergency calls are climbing
every day.

10:33.371 --> 10:35.504
Where did you say the fight is?

10:35.678 --> 10:37.288
WOMAN:
Balboa Park. Send someone quick!

10:37.375 --> 10:39.421
-It's getting pretty vicious.
-Are they armed?

10:39.508 --> 10:41.510
Sort of.

10:41.597 --> 10:43.512
â™ª Get ya one way or another...â™ª

10:43.599 --> 10:47.298
-Hey, hey!
-Put the metal detectors down!

10:47.472 --> 10:50.519
Now! Smart man.

10:50.606 --> 10:52.608
Can't find a treasure
from inside a jail cell.

10:52.739 --> 10:55.306
-911. What's your emergency?
-911. What's your emergency?

10:55.393 --> 10:57.047
-911. What's your emergency?
-MAN: Hi.

10:57.178 --> 10:59.136
Can you please send someone
to Griffith Park?

10:59.223 --> 11:00.660
The Western Avenue entrance.
There's some idiot here

11:00.834 --> 11:02.749
trying to dig
under the bear statue.

11:02.923 --> 11:04.620
-[yelling over phone]
-What was that?

11:04.751 --> 11:06.535
You might want to send
the fire department, too.

11:06.709 --> 11:11.279
â™ª And if the lights
are all down...â™ª

11:11.366 --> 11:12.497
BOBBY:
LAFD coming through.

11:12.672 --> 11:13.716
Sir, LAFD is here.

11:13.890 --> 11:15.196
Try to stay calm,

11:15.326 --> 11:16.545
and we'll get this statue
off of you.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.983
â™ª One way or another...â™ª

11:20.070 --> 11:22.507
-911. What's your emergency?
-911. What's your emergency?

11:22.682 --> 11:24.205
ATHENA:
Your turn, sir. Drop it.

11:24.335 --> 11:26.076
â™ª Or anotherâ™ª

11:26.207 --> 11:27.643
-â™ª I'm gonna win yaâ™ª
-MAN: Cheating bastard!

11:27.730 --> 11:30.037
â™ª I'll get ya, I'll get ya...â™ª

11:30.211 --> 11:32.430
Not sure it's an X, but that's
definitely gonna leave a mark.

11:32.561 --> 11:33.910
BOBBY:
We'll have you out

11:34.084 --> 11:35.346
in a sec, sir.

11:35.433 --> 11:36.870
[grunts]
I can't believe it wasn't here.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.351
Well, cross Griffith bear
park statue off the list.

11:41.135 --> 11:43.224
JAMAL: Man, I really thought
I was onto something.

11:43.354 --> 11:44.529
Better luck next guess.

11:44.616 --> 11:45.530
-Mm-hmm.
-Thank you.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.881
â™ª The lights are all out...â™ª

11:48.011 --> 11:50.274
TAYLOR:
The latest numbers show
six hospitalizations

11:50.448 --> 11:54.017
and 17 arrests since
the treasure hunt was announced.

11:54.148 --> 11:55.889
It's a hoax!
Listen, people,

11:55.976 --> 11:57.891
please stop rising your lives.

11:58.021 --> 11:59.893
Uh, thank you
for that perspective, ma'am.

11:59.980 --> 12:01.155
My husband almost died!

12:01.329 --> 12:03.940
More people are gonna die!

12:04.027 --> 12:05.420
[sirens wailing]

12:05.594 --> 12:06.987
You need to stop!
Turn that thing off!

12:07.161 --> 12:09.206
Sir! You cannot dig here!

12:09.380 --> 12:12.166
-No! Everybody back!
-Go, go, go, go.

12:14.037 --> 12:15.517
â™ª One way or anotherâ™ª

12:15.691 --> 12:17.606
â™ª I'm gonna lose yaâ™ª

12:17.693 --> 12:19.564
â™ª I'm gonna give you the slipâ™ª

12:19.651 --> 12:22.002
â™ª A slip of the hip
for anotherâ™ª

12:22.176 --> 12:23.699
â™ª I'm gonna lose yaâ™ª

12:23.830 --> 12:25.135
â™ª I'm gonna trick ya,
I'll trick yaâ™ª

12:25.222 --> 12:27.137
â™ª I'll walk down the mallâ™ª

12:27.268 --> 12:29.618
â™ª Stand over by the wall,
where I can see it all...â™ª

12:29.705 --> 12:31.402
They never call before they dig.

12:31.489 --> 12:35.145
â™ª One way or another,
I'll get ya, I'll get yaâ™ª

12:35.276 --> 12:37.844
â™ª Where I can see it all,
find out who ya call.â™ª

12:38.018 --> 12:39.193
EDDIE:
You think it's weird
that all the cases

12:39.280 --> 12:41.412
are solo acts?
No teams.

12:41.499 --> 12:43.066
-Everybody's working alone.
-I guess people

12:43.240 --> 12:44.851
are greedy, don't want
to share the treasure.

12:44.981 --> 12:47.679
Maybe that's the flaw
in their plan.

12:47.854 --> 12:50.073
Two brains are better than one.

12:50.204 --> 12:52.075
What if we worked on it
together,

12:52.206 --> 12:53.729
split the $5 million
fifty-fifty?

12:53.860 --> 12:58.168
Sorry, I, uh,
already made a deal with Taylor.

12:58.255 --> 12:59.691
[sighs]

12:59.866 --> 13:01.998
How would you feel
about 33-and-a-third?

13:02.129 --> 13:03.913
Mm.

13:04.087 --> 13:06.176
You need to give him 50%
of your cut.

13:06.263 --> 13:07.656
We're not splitting it
three ways.

13:07.743 --> 13:09.223
Do you really need
the extra $400K that bad?

13:09.397 --> 13:11.529
I already promised my cameraman
I'd split my half with him.

13:11.660 --> 13:13.531
So we split it four ways.

13:13.662 --> 13:16.186
Okay? It's still more
than a million each.

13:16.273 --> 13:18.493
And 25% of nothing
is still nothing.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.538
We're missing something.

13:20.712 --> 13:21.975
EDDIE:
I did some research
on the whole willow tree thing.

13:22.062 --> 13:23.280
Do you guys know

13:23.454 --> 13:25.021
there's something called
an arroyo willow?

13:25.195 --> 13:26.240
It's not a tree.

13:26.327 --> 13:27.415
TAYLOR:
More like a shrub.

13:27.502 --> 13:28.677
BOTH:
Hard to stop beneath it.

13:28.764 --> 13:30.810
Okay. I'll just be
over here, then.

13:30.984 --> 13:32.724
Thinking. By myself.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.944
-Go team.
-TAYLOR: We still have
too many options.

13:35.118 --> 13:36.641
We need more data
to rule some of these out.

13:36.728 --> 13:38.469
Well, I think we know a guy.

13:38.643 --> 13:40.210
[alarm rings]

13:40.341 --> 13:42.212
[groans]
I wonder how many
dumb treasure hunt calls

13:42.299 --> 13:43.910
we're gonna get today.

13:43.997 --> 13:46.129
I know. It's been crazy, right?

13:46.260 --> 13:48.349
I think we had four yesterday.

13:48.479 --> 13:51.265
Uh, oh, yeah?
[sighs]

13:52.309 --> 13:53.702
What were they?

13:53.876 --> 13:55.356
Oh. Well, you know,
there's a homeless guy...

13:55.486 --> 13:57.271
[continues indistinctly]

13:57.358 --> 13:59.490
CHIMNEY:
Feel that, Hen?

13:59.664 --> 14:01.666
Oh, I feel a definite chill.

14:01.753 --> 14:03.886
We've been left out in the cold.

14:03.973 --> 14:07.194
I think it's time
we show them how it's done.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.460
JAMAL:
No, sir, the paramedics

14:12.547 --> 14:13.983
are on their way to you now.

14:14.157 --> 14:16.899
-It's not at the observatory.
-Oh...

14:16.986 --> 14:18.509
Who thought thatwas
a good idea?

14:18.596 --> 14:20.555
-MAN: Not it!
-LINDA: Hollis's fifth book,

14:20.729 --> 14:22.122
Stabbed Beneath the Stars.

14:22.209 --> 14:23.906
The murder takes place
at the observatory.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.777
911. What's your emergency?

14:25.952 --> 14:27.170
MAN:
There's ants everywhere!

14:27.301 --> 14:29.651
I'm sorry, did you say "ants"?

14:29.738 --> 14:32.480
[sirens wailing]

14:32.567 --> 14:33.655
[horn honks]

14:33.829 --> 14:34.961
[gasping]

14:36.876 --> 14:38.834
-[shouting]
-Fire ants.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.923
Looks like he stepped
into a whole colony.

14:41.010 --> 14:43.056
-Let's hope he's not allergic.
-Or a good guesser.

14:43.143 --> 14:45.101
Two sections
of inch-and-three-quarter line

14:45.275 --> 14:46.929
with a narrow fog.

14:47.016 --> 14:48.931
Should be enough for us
to knock those ants right off.

14:49.105 --> 14:51.064
-We'll make a water curtain.
-[shouting]

14:51.151 --> 14:52.152
40 psi!

14:52.326 --> 14:54.719
[water rushing]

14:57.984 --> 15:00.682
[man shouting]

15:04.773 --> 15:06.166
Okay, get in there.

15:07.297 --> 15:09.169
-[grunting]
-You've got to stay still.

15:09.256 --> 15:10.997
-Try to stay still.
-HEN: Checking airway
for swelling.

15:11.127 --> 15:12.868
Bilateral breath sounds

15:12.999 --> 15:14.348
are clear and undiminished.

15:14.435 --> 15:15.784
No stridor noted.

15:15.871 --> 15:17.351
Pushing fluids,
25 of diphenhydramine,

15:17.525 --> 15:19.875
with some epi and solumedrol
to mitigate this venom reaction.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.572
[shouting]

15:21.746 --> 15:23.966
-CHIMNEY: Try to stay still.
-And five of morphine for
the pain.

15:24.140 --> 15:25.707
BOBBY:
All right, let's load him up.

15:25.794 --> 15:27.578
[insect buzzing]

15:29.624 --> 15:31.669
Wonder what made him want
to dig out here.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.280
Guess you'll never know.

15:35.673 --> 15:39.808
Yeah. What did make you think
to dig out here?

15:39.939 --> 15:42.071
[groans weakly]

15:42.245 --> 15:45.161
OFFICER:
All right, this way,
up the hall.

15:45.335 --> 15:46.641
MAN:
Could we leave yet?

15:46.815 --> 15:47.729
MAN 2: Hey, you know what?
I know my rights.

15:47.816 --> 15:49.426
It's called the Constitution.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.037
STAFFORD:
Hey, Athena.

15:51.211 --> 15:52.821
Picked this one up
at the Melrose Trading Post,

15:52.995 --> 15:55.171
trying to steal a chest
from one of the street vendors.

15:55.345 --> 15:56.781
It was a misunderstanding.

15:56.868 --> 15:58.392
That looked just like
the one on the video.

15:58.479 --> 15:59.871
The markings are
very distinctive.

16:00.046 --> 16:01.351
Yeah, she was also arrested
three days ago

16:01.438 --> 16:03.571
at the Beaumont Flea Market--
similar misunderstanding.

16:03.658 --> 16:05.355
Maybe not that distinctive.

16:05.442 --> 16:06.835
MAN:
The Manson Tunnel.

16:07.009 --> 16:08.706
You gotta look
in the Manson Tunnel.

16:08.837 --> 16:10.012
For a buried treasure?

16:10.186 --> 16:11.927
What treasure?

16:12.058 --> 16:14.582
OFFICER:
Okay, time to go.
Let's chat

16:14.669 --> 16:15.670
about what's
in the Manson Tunnel.

16:15.844 --> 16:17.237
Okay, let's book her

16:17.324 --> 16:19.108
and hope she doesn't make bail
by Saturday.

16:19.282 --> 16:21.806
I hear Antiques Roadshow
is gonna be in Pasadena.

16:21.893 --> 16:24.418
I'd hate for there to be
another misunderstanding.

16:24.592 --> 16:26.550
STAFFORD:
Copy that.

16:33.035 --> 16:34.645
Bobby?

16:34.819 --> 16:37.997
BOBBY:
Oh, hey, I, uh,
I'm just making some breakfast.

16:38.171 --> 16:40.521
Oh, sounds great.

16:40.651 --> 16:42.958
Did you have
as crazy a shift as I did?

16:43.089 --> 16:44.438
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Super crazy.

16:44.612 --> 16:47.919
[laughs] I don't know about you,
but I am sick and tired

16:48.094 --> 16:50.009
of these treasure-hunting fools.

16:50.183 --> 16:52.185
[clattering]

16:56.319 --> 16:58.321
-What was that?
-Uh, it's just a project

16:58.452 --> 16:59.409
that I'm working on.

16:59.496 --> 17:00.541
You want some French toast?

17:01.542 --> 17:03.587
I'm gonna make you
some French toast.

17:05.415 --> 17:08.766
â™ª

17:08.897 --> 17:10.855
A-Athena, you want some...
you want some coffee?

17:10.942 --> 17:13.206
How about some, uh...
you want some eggs?

17:15.251 --> 17:17.645
[sighs]:
Oh, God.

17:17.732 --> 17:19.647
Not you, too.

17:27.089 --> 17:28.786
So, these are the woods,
parks around L.A.

17:28.960 --> 17:31.224
where you find creeks or rivers.

17:31.398 --> 17:33.574
The red pins, that's
where you find willow trees.

17:33.748 --> 17:36.490
Now, the white pins
are where you find herons.

17:36.577 --> 17:38.231
The green, bullfrogs.

17:38.405 --> 17:41.538
I'm not sure what the
"gray bridge roared" means yet.

17:41.669 --> 17:44.237
-I think it might be a metaphor.
-This is very...

17:44.367 --> 17:46.326
-thorough.
-And I'm making some headway.

17:46.456 --> 17:50.460
I think the treasure is here
in Solstice Canyon.

17:50.634 --> 17:52.680
-There is a creek...
-Arrested someone there
this morning.

17:52.810 --> 17:54.334
-Uh...
-No treasure.

17:54.464 --> 17:55.944
Damn.

17:56.031 --> 17:57.728
I thought I was
really onto something there.

17:57.815 --> 17:59.513
Guess I'm gonna have
to recalibrate.

17:59.600 --> 18:00.601
I think I do, too.

18:00.775 --> 18:02.342
Where did this come from?

18:02.472 --> 18:03.908
What, the whiteboard?
I picked it up at the store

18:04.039 --> 18:05.475
-on the way home.
-No.

18:05.606 --> 18:07.260
[laughs]
I mean this sudden desire

18:07.390 --> 18:09.044
to go searching
for hidden treasure.

18:09.218 --> 18:12.091
I don't know. I just, I saw
other people looking for it--

18:12.178 --> 18:14.049
and, I mean, it's $5 million--

18:14.180 --> 18:15.529
and I figured, where's the harm?

18:15.616 --> 18:17.270
It's no different
than playing the lottery, right?

18:17.400 --> 18:20.621
No one ever ended up in the ICU
buying a lottery ticket.

18:20.795 --> 18:22.840
There was that one incident
where the two peo...

18:22.971 --> 18:24.190
Okay. Doesn't matter.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.192
I'm not gonna go doing
anything reckless.

18:26.279 --> 18:29.369
I'm not gonna go scaling cliffs
or dig around gas mains.

18:29.499 --> 18:31.284
-This is just dreaming.
-About the money.

18:31.414 --> 18:33.199
What would we do with it?

18:33.329 --> 18:35.636
I thought if I found it,
I would surprise you

18:35.810 --> 18:37.855
with trust funds for the kids,
a new kitchen,

18:37.986 --> 18:39.596
maybe even a whole new house.

18:39.727 --> 18:41.511
I thought we could take
that honeymoon we never had,

18:41.642 --> 18:42.730
see the world.

18:42.860 --> 18:45.167
-Hmm.
-Hell...

18:45.298 --> 18:47.300
we could even decide to retire.

18:48.344 --> 18:49.563
Retire?

18:49.650 --> 18:51.652
I thought you loved your job.

18:51.826 --> 18:54.176
I do. But jobs like ours,
nobody does them forever.

18:54.307 --> 18:57.179
Eventually you hang it up
and go fishing.

18:57.310 --> 18:59.616
Not me. I mean,
you can have your fishing cabin

18:59.747 --> 19:02.663
or whatever at Lake Arrowhead.

19:02.837 --> 19:04.534
We can go up on the weekends.

19:04.665 --> 19:06.580
But I plan to be
out on those streets,

19:06.667 --> 19:08.756
until they force me off them.

19:09.887 --> 19:12.238
Somebody almost did.

19:14.892 --> 19:17.112
You nearly died last year,
Athena.

19:17.286 --> 19:19.680
I know you don't like
to talk about it, but it was

19:19.854 --> 19:21.551
a really close call.

19:21.682 --> 19:25.033
And most people would have
at least thought about quitting.

19:25.207 --> 19:26.469
Retiring.

19:26.643 --> 19:29.080
[sighs]:
I did. Elaine brought it up.

19:29.211 --> 19:32.475
She wanted me to seriously
consider it, so I did.

19:32.649 --> 19:34.260
And I decided not to.

19:35.783 --> 19:37.698
You never told me that.

19:37.785 --> 19:40.570
Well, I didn't see the point.
The decision was already made.

19:40.701 --> 19:43.138
I mean, what was there to say?
[chuckles]

19:43.269 --> 19:45.358
[Athena exhales]

19:45.532 --> 19:49.275
So, what was that
about that French toast?

19:53.148 --> 19:54.497
I see you've requested
the Willow Tree Suite.

19:54.628 --> 19:56.934
I think the two of you
will enjoy it.

19:57.108 --> 19:58.675
You and your, uh...?

19:58.806 --> 20:01.243
Oh, uh, boyfriend.

20:01.374 --> 20:03.637
-For now.
-Oh.

20:03.724 --> 20:05.639
Actually, you know,
just between us...

20:05.726 --> 20:07.815
I really think
this could be the weekend.

20:07.945 --> 20:09.817
Like theweekend, you know?

20:09.947 --> 20:12.167
I mean, just one last score.

20:12.298 --> 20:15.039
I... I mean,
your romantic setting

20:15.170 --> 20:17.781
is, uh...
I think he'll finally be ready.

20:17.868 --> 20:19.174
Love it.

20:19.305 --> 20:20.741
I'll send champagne up
to the room,

20:20.915 --> 20:22.917
-set the mood.
-[chuckles]

20:23.047 --> 20:26.616
-And where is the lucky fella?
-He's just outside. Yeah.

20:26.790 --> 20:29.880
Just, you know,
getting our stuff from the car.

20:31.099 --> 20:33.841
Uh, so, um...

20:34.755 --> 20:36.583
"River's Edge."

20:36.713 --> 20:37.975
You guys getting a lot
of business lately, or...?

20:38.149 --> 20:40.195
Actually, it's been,
uh, pretty good.

20:41.109 --> 20:42.719
Hey. Why you looking over there?

20:42.850 --> 20:44.504
Willow Tree Suite's that way.

20:44.634 --> 20:46.332
Wasn't over there, babe.
Trust me, I got a nose

20:46.506 --> 20:47.550
for this kind of thing.

20:47.724 --> 20:49.465
I do trust you.

20:50.553 --> 20:52.555
-Hey, babe?
-Yeah, babe?

20:52.642 --> 20:54.644
Look, you know
I love our adventures, right?

20:54.775 --> 20:55.906
Uh-huh.

20:56.037 --> 20:57.865
I was thinking...

20:57.995 --> 20:59.432
like, if we do find
this five mil,

20:59.562 --> 21:00.955
maybe we could call it quits
on the schemes.

21:01.085 --> 21:03.436
Check it out!
The ground here is super soft.

21:03.610 --> 21:07.091
-I bet somebody just dug it up.
-Yeah. Okay,

21:07.222 --> 21:08.310
the grass does not look dug-up.

21:08.441 --> 21:09.355
Baby, they're hiding treasure.

21:09.529 --> 21:11.531
It wouldn't look dug-up.

21:11.661 --> 21:13.837
-Okay.
-[chuckles]

21:13.968 --> 21:16.231
-There is definitely
something down here.
-PERCY: Hey!

21:16.405 --> 21:18.015
-Get away from there!
-[Richie sighs]

21:18.146 --> 21:19.626
Hey, okay, uh, keep digging.
I'll hold him off.

21:19.756 --> 21:22.019
-KEISHA: Digging?
-PERCY: What are you doing?

21:22.193 --> 21:23.543
-Digging on my property?
-Sir...

21:23.673 --> 21:25.196
You can't dig there!

21:25.327 --> 21:27.416
-[rumbling, crackling]
-Baby?

21:28.809 --> 21:29.723
[screams]

21:29.853 --> 21:31.725
Ah, man.

21:32.769 --> 21:34.945
Oh! What is that smell?

21:35.119 --> 21:36.947
[siren wailing]

21:37.034 --> 21:39.341
Septic tank.
Roof rusted through.

21:39.472 --> 21:41.604
Woman's been stuck down there
for seven minutes.

21:41.691 --> 21:43.432
A tank like that
is likely full of methane.

21:43.563 --> 21:45.042
We're gonna need
some breathable air.

21:45.216 --> 21:47.784
Let's get on it. What's the name
of the woman down there?

21:47.915 --> 21:49.264
-Keisha. She just fell in.
-Okay, gentlemen,

21:49.438 --> 21:50.396
this ground
could still give way.

21:50.526 --> 21:51.919
I'm gonna need you to step back.

21:52.049 --> 21:54.008
We don't want you
falling in, too. Keisha,

21:54.138 --> 21:55.705
just sit tight. We're gonna
get you out of there.

21:55.836 --> 21:58.012
Not exactly going anywhere.

21:58.142 --> 21:59.492
What were you doing out here?

21:59.666 --> 22:01.494
[chuckles]:
Duh. Digging up the treasure.

22:02.495 --> 22:04.627
-What treasure?
-River's Edge B&B?

22:04.801 --> 22:07.413
Willow Tree Suite?
Of course it's here.

22:10.154 --> 22:11.504
It is here, right?

22:11.634 --> 22:13.288
'Cause... otherwise,
she's gonna kill me.

22:13.419 --> 22:15.464
CHIMNEY:
Okay, Keisha. I'm gonna lower

22:15.595 --> 22:17.292
a mask to you, and I need you
to put it on. Can you do that?

22:17.423 --> 22:19.468
Okay, here it comes.

22:19.599 --> 22:21.383
She's already showing signs
of hypoxia, Cap.

22:21.514 --> 22:22.950
We got to get her out of there

22:23.080 --> 22:24.517
before she has
permanent neurological damage.

22:24.691 --> 22:25.561
BOBBY:
Okay. Eddie,
I want you to extend

22:25.648 --> 22:27.084
the aerial ladder over the hole.

22:27.215 --> 22:27.998
We'll lower Buck down.
He'll pull her out.

22:28.085 --> 22:30.087
Oh, wait. Why me?

22:30.218 --> 22:31.872
I did say
you could go next time.

22:32.046 --> 22:34.178
Not the same, man.

22:34.309 --> 22:35.528
BOBBY:
That's good.

22:35.658 --> 22:37.834
Nice and slow. Keep it coming.

22:37.965 --> 22:39.662
Okay, about five more feet,
Eddie.

22:39.793 --> 22:41.838
Doing okay, Buck?

22:41.969 --> 22:43.710
Well, I'm not looking forward
to this next part.

22:43.840 --> 22:45.668
All right, Keisha,
let's get you out of here.

22:45.842 --> 22:47.104
[Keisha grunting]

22:47.278 --> 22:49.019
Keisha! She's drowning.
She's gone under!

22:49.106 --> 22:50.717
I can't see her!
Get me down there now!

22:50.847 --> 22:52.936
-Eddie, drop him, drop him.
-Wh-What's happening?

22:54.460 --> 22:56.331
BUCK:
Keisha! Keisha. Keisha.

22:56.462 --> 22:58.115
-I got you.
-[coughing]

22:58.246 --> 23:00.248
You're okay.
You're okay. I got her!

23:00.335 --> 23:01.510
-[whimpering]
-We'll get you out.

23:03.338 --> 23:05.209
Okay. Guys, get us out of here!

23:05.340 --> 23:06.776
Okay, bring 'em up.

23:07.777 --> 23:10.519
[Keisha coughing]

23:12.521 --> 23:14.349
BUCK:
I got her. I got her.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.003
[coughs]

23:16.133 --> 23:18.005
Sorry we couldn't find
the five mil, babe.

23:18.135 --> 23:19.659
I don't need the money.

23:19.789 --> 23:21.922
I just need you.

23:22.052 --> 23:24.141
So whatever you're waiting for,

23:24.272 --> 23:26.056
you don't have to wait anymore.

23:26.143 --> 23:28.885
My answer is yes.
[chuckles]

23:29.016 --> 23:31.932
Uh, yes what?

23:32.106 --> 23:34.282
Yes, I will marry you.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.588
We can settle down

23:35.718 --> 23:38.286
and start a whole new adventure
as a family.

23:38.460 --> 23:42.116
Oh. [chuckles softly]
Babe, uh...

23:42.246 --> 23:44.510
I thought you knew.

23:44.684 --> 23:47.643
-I ammarried.
-What?!

23:48.949 --> 23:51.647
You're my adventure.
[chuckles]

23:51.734 --> 23:53.606
J-Just on the side.

23:55.434 --> 23:56.565
[siren wailing]

24:02.919 --> 24:05.748
Uh, she wanted some space.

24:05.922 --> 24:07.881
[chuckles]

24:09.317 --> 24:12.059
-[sniffing]
-[siren wailing]

24:12.189 --> 24:14.104
Oof. Whew!

24:14.278 --> 24:16.237
Come on.

24:16.324 --> 24:19.022
[siren wails]

24:22.635 --> 24:24.506
Got a call
from the alarm company

24:24.637 --> 24:26.508
-about a break-in?
-They called me, too.

24:26.639 --> 24:29.424
Jeremiah. I was Mr. Harcourt's
personal assistant.

24:29.598 --> 24:30.730
The door was like that
when I got here.

24:30.860 --> 24:32.340
I haven't touched a thing.
I figured

24:32.427 --> 24:33.515
it was probably
some treasure hunters looking

24:33.646 --> 24:35.561
-for clues.
-Okay. Stay here.

24:35.691 --> 24:37.476
Okay.

24:49.313 --> 24:52.360
This is LAPD.
The door's open. I'm coming in.

25:02.588 --> 25:05.460
â™ª

25:05.591 --> 25:07.462
[drawer opens]

25:07.593 --> 25:09.377
[papers rustling]

25:11.205 --> 25:12.641
[drawer closes]

25:13.686 --> 25:15.122
LAPD.

25:15.252 --> 25:18.604
Get up slowly.
Hands in the air.

25:23.913 --> 25:25.175
What are you doing in my house?

25:25.306 --> 25:27.395
ATHENA:
Hollis Harcourt?

25:29.179 --> 25:31.617
Looking mighty good
for a dead man.

25:39.059 --> 25:40.016
JEREMIAH:
You're alive?

25:40.190 --> 25:41.452
I'm gonna kill you!

25:41.627 --> 25:44.064
Ah. I have not known
this man for long,

25:44.238 --> 25:47.633
-but I'm confident
he's not worth it.
-You're such an ass.

25:47.720 --> 25:50.810
What happened to,
"He had such a good soul"?

25:50.897 --> 25:53.682
-And who changed my alarm code?
-JEREMIAH: Oh, I don't know.

25:53.856 --> 25:55.597
Maybe the person
who's not supposed to be dead?

25:55.684 --> 25:58.513
And who was conveniently
left out of the will?

25:58.600 --> 26:00.210
Speaking of that, Mr. Harcourt,

26:00.297 --> 26:01.951
I think you and I
need to have a conversation

26:02.082 --> 26:04.867
about your unexpected return
to the land of the living.

26:04.998 --> 26:06.695
JEREMIAH:
15 years of working

26:06.869 --> 26:09.219
-for a solipsistic narcissist...
-HOLLIS: Don't let the thesaurus

26:09.306 --> 26:10.656
hit you on the way out!

26:12.396 --> 26:14.007
Sorry for dragging you over here

26:14.181 --> 26:15.835
for nothing, Sergeant,
but as you can see,

26:15.922 --> 26:19.012
there's been no break-in.
Just a simple misunderstanding.

26:19.099 --> 26:20.883
I think your work here is done.

26:21.014 --> 26:22.450
Or perhaps it's just beginning.

26:22.581 --> 26:25.105
Fraud. Filing a false report.

26:25.192 --> 26:28.674
Forging a death certificate.
All crimes, Mr. Harcourt.

26:28.848 --> 26:30.110
And you would be right
to arrest me

26:30.240 --> 26:32.634
if I had done
even one of those things.

26:32.808 --> 26:34.810
[whispers]:
But I didn't.

26:34.897 --> 26:36.812
Simply had my lawyer
have my publicist

26:36.986 --> 26:38.901
release a statement, and voilÃ .

26:39.075 --> 26:42.122
Cue the heartfelt tributes
and outpourings of emotion.

26:42.252 --> 26:45.691
I'm feeling some kind
of emotions myself right now.

26:45.778 --> 26:48.258
And your ridiculous
treasure hunt has the city

26:48.432 --> 26:49.651
completely off the rails.

26:49.825 --> 26:51.435
Isn't it great?

26:51.522 --> 26:53.655
Confirms everything
I ever thought about this town.

26:53.829 --> 26:56.484
Full of selfish, greedy morons.

26:56.571 --> 26:58.312
Well, those morons
are dropping like flies.

26:58.486 --> 27:00.880
-You need to call
this whole thing off.
-I can't.

27:01.054 --> 27:02.795
I need to find out how it ends.

27:02.925 --> 27:05.014
You buried it. Pretty sure
you know how it ends.

27:05.101 --> 27:07.147
Not the hunt.

27:07.277 --> 27:09.192
[whispers]:
The book.

27:10.106 --> 27:11.499
Gutted in Glendale.

27:11.630 --> 27:12.631
It's my next novel.

27:12.805 --> 27:13.849
I've been working on it

27:14.023 --> 27:16.243
for two years. Huge advance.

27:16.330 --> 27:17.940
-[pours drink]
-Already sold the movie rights.

27:18.071 --> 27:20.247
Tom Hanks wants to star.

27:20.334 --> 27:22.466
He loves these, uh,

27:22.553 --> 27:24.077
blood and treasure stories.

27:24.164 --> 27:26.253
Mine is gonna be
like The Da Vinci Code,

27:26.427 --> 27:28.081
only bigger.

27:28.255 --> 27:30.431
Just one problem.

27:31.867 --> 27:34.348
I don't know how it ends.

27:34.522 --> 27:37.438
So you buried the treasure...

27:37.612 --> 27:39.353
To find my ending.

27:39.527 --> 27:41.747
I've blown
the last three deadlines,

27:41.834 --> 27:43.531
and, uh,
people have started asking

27:43.618 --> 27:45.098
some very uncomfortable
questions.

27:45.185 --> 27:47.274
Saying a lot

27:47.361 --> 27:49.885
of very ugly words, like...

27:50.059 --> 27:52.105
"refund." Ugh.
And "lawsuit."

27:52.279 --> 27:54.716
But I am so close.
I can feel it.

27:54.803 --> 27:57.676
I'm gonna find my ending.
I just need a little more time.

27:57.850 --> 27:59.112
So maybe you keep the news

27:59.199 --> 28:01.070
that I'm not dead
between the two of us.

28:01.201 --> 28:02.768
-I could just sneak
back out and...
-The alarm call

28:02.898 --> 28:04.552
went out over the radio,

28:04.726 --> 28:07.903
so I'm probably gonna
run into some curious reporters

28:08.077 --> 28:09.209
back at the station.

28:09.339 --> 28:10.471
And what
are you gonna tell them?

28:10.558 --> 28:12.125
The truth.

28:16.346 --> 28:18.000
BUCK:
Wait.

28:18.131 --> 28:19.698
-We were his research?
-[Hen chuckles]

28:19.785 --> 28:21.351
More like his lab rats.

28:21.525 --> 28:23.789
Running around in his little
treasure hunt simulation.

28:23.876 --> 28:25.573
BOBBY:
Which is exactly what he wanted.

28:25.660 --> 28:27.314
Every emergency on the news was

28:27.401 --> 28:29.142
-a new chapter for his book.
-The idea is

28:29.316 --> 28:32.188
surprisingly diabolical
for Hollis Harcourt.

28:32.362 --> 28:34.669
Have you ever read
any of his books?

28:34.800 --> 28:37.019
Well, if we were his research,
we should all get paid.

28:37.150 --> 28:38.455
-[chuckles]
-He tell Athena

28:38.586 --> 28:39.761
-where the treasure's at?
-BOBBY: No.

28:39.848 --> 28:41.545
If there even isa treasure.

28:41.632 --> 28:43.896
Hollis never had to actually
plant one to get what he wanted.

28:43.983 --> 28:45.898
He just needed to say
that he did.

28:46.028 --> 28:49.162
And since we now officially know
that he's a liar...

28:49.249 --> 28:50.772
It's time to give up. Right?

28:50.946 --> 28:53.732
No more treasure hunt.

28:53.819 --> 28:55.472
[sighs]

28:57.126 --> 28:59.389
["Atlas Hands" by Benjamin
Francis Leftwich playing]

â™ª There is a ship without
a name there, and it is...â™ª

TAYLOR:
[sighs] I can't believe
I fell for it.

29:07.833 --> 29:09.965
[chuckles softly]
I feel like an idiot.

29:10.052 --> 29:13.752
Come on, we, uh,
we all got fooled.

29:14.796 --> 29:17.190
Yeah, but I should've
known better.

29:17.277 --> 29:19.061
-Mm.
-I'm a trained journalist.

29:19.192 --> 29:21.020
-[chuckles]
-Or, at least, I was.

29:21.107 --> 29:24.980
Before I got caught up
in this dumb treasure hunt.

29:25.154 --> 29:27.853
[sighs]

29:27.983 --> 29:30.420
What was I thinking?

29:30.507 --> 29:32.422
Think of it as a...
a big adventure.

29:32.553 --> 29:34.207
Uh...

29:34.381 --> 29:37.558
But you got to sleep
in your own bed every night.

29:37.645 --> 29:39.212
TAYLOR:
Huh.

29:40.256 --> 29:42.258
We were so close.

29:42.432 --> 29:43.956
Yeah, we were.

29:45.871 --> 29:50.049
And then that selfish,
lazy bastard

29:50.223 --> 29:52.573
ruined everything.

29:54.227 --> 29:57.099
Actually, that's not fair.

29:57.230 --> 29:59.667
He wasn't completely lazy.

29:59.798 --> 30:02.626
You know, he did like to jog.

30:04.454 --> 30:06.674
But I can still hate him, right?

30:09.633 --> 30:11.244
Right?

30:20.253 --> 30:22.124

30:22.255 --> 30:24.866
Hey.

30:30.698 --> 30:32.047
-Mm-hmm.
-[chuckles]

30:32.221 --> 30:34.702
Do you even know how to fish?

30:34.789 --> 30:37.661
-I am from Minnesota.
-Well, I take that as a yes.

Hmm.

This is terrible.

30:56.071 --> 30:57.725
-No, it's awful.
-[chuckles]

30:57.812 --> 30:59.683
He's not much of a poet.
Or even a writer, I guess.

31:08.605 --> 31:10.520
The narrow place.

31:10.607 --> 31:11.913
I was never able to figure

31:12.000 --> 31:13.610
that part out.
I searched his novels.

31:13.741 --> 31:16.135
Couldn't find a reference.

31:16.309 --> 31:17.701
Not sure what I missed.

31:19.312 --> 31:20.966
You're missing a book.

31:21.096 --> 31:23.533
Yeah, Hollis's unpublished book.

31:23.707 --> 31:25.318
Gutted in Glendale.

31:25.405 --> 31:27.668
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

â™ª

31:31.759 --> 31:33.979
-Bobby?
-Yeah.

31:34.153 --> 31:37.721
I think I know
where the treasure is.

31:45.033 --> 31:46.643
ATHENA: The Glendale Narrows.
That's what they call

31:46.643 --> 31:49.646
-this part of the river.
-Wait. You mean

31:49.777 --> 31:51.126
this concrete channel
with water in it?

31:51.213 --> 31:53.085
I keep telling everybody,
this is not a river.

31:53.259 --> 31:56.436
Which is exactly why
no one else ever thought of it.

31:56.566 --> 31:58.090
All of you adventurers

31:58.220 --> 31:59.830
thinking you had to trek up
into the mountains.

31:59.961 --> 32:03.312
Never occurred to you
to look right here in the city.

32:03.443 --> 32:04.357
Home of herons.

32:04.531 --> 32:06.185
And bullfrogs.

32:06.315 --> 32:08.578
And a gray bridge roaring.
Right there.

32:08.665 --> 32:10.885
[chuckles]
Bit on the nose for a metaphor.

32:11.016 --> 32:14.106
Well, Hollis isn't really
a poet. Or a trustworthy person.

32:14.236 --> 32:16.195
HEN:
He's not the only one.

32:16.325 --> 32:17.979
Uh, seriously?

32:18.110 --> 32:20.895
Well, so much for giving up.

32:21.069 --> 32:22.679
I cannot believe you guys.
We agreed

32:22.810 --> 32:25.813
-we'd all stop looking.
-And yet here we all are.

32:25.900 --> 32:27.815
Did you two
really bring your gear?

32:27.902 --> 32:29.121
EDDIE:
Wasn't sure what the terrain

32:29.251 --> 32:30.774
would be like.
Wanted to be ready.

32:30.905 --> 32:33.212
-[scoffs]
-Hey. They brought
their med kits.

32:33.342 --> 32:34.561
This treasure hunt
has been nothing

32:34.691 --> 32:36.258
but medical rescues
and injuries.

32:36.389 --> 32:38.391
[chuckles] I was not
about to be one of them.

32:38.478 --> 32:40.045
So, what tipped it off
for you guys?

32:40.175 --> 32:41.350
Hollis's
yet-to-be-released novel,

32:41.481 --> 32:43.265
Gutted in Glendale.

32:43.352 --> 32:47.269
And then the part in the poem
about a narrow place.

32:47.443 --> 32:49.184
Put it together...

32:49.271 --> 32:50.925
-Glendale Narrows.
-It was the river for us.

32:51.056 --> 32:54.494
Uh, Taylor said
Hollis used to jog here.

32:57.976 --> 33:00.065
My wife wrote an algorithm

33:00.152 --> 33:03.198
that detects changes
in satellite images.

33:05.722 --> 33:08.377
Okay, well, what do we do now?

33:08.508 --> 33:10.945
Six of us, one treasure.

33:11.076 --> 33:13.426
Technically,
Bobby and I pulled up first.

33:13.513 --> 33:15.906
-Whoa.
-HEN: Because you elected
to keep the name

33:16.037 --> 33:18.387
of Hollis's unpublished novel
to yourself.

33:18.518 --> 33:19.823
I didn't know it was important.

33:19.954 --> 33:21.521
-[chuckles]
-Also, pretty sure this is

33:21.651 --> 33:24.089
the first time any of us
are hearing about an algorithm.

33:24.219 --> 33:25.873
Okay, guys, look,

33:26.004 --> 33:27.614
it's $5 million.

33:27.744 --> 33:28.745
So we split it five ways.

33:28.876 --> 33:30.530
Seven.

33:30.704 --> 33:31.748
We have a preexisting deal
with Taylor

33:31.922 --> 33:33.315
-and her... cameraman.
-[sighs]

33:33.489 --> 33:35.187
The cameraman with no name
gets a cut?

33:35.361 --> 33:36.536
-No, no, no.
-HEN: I really don't think
that anyone

33:36.710 --> 33:38.494
who isn't physically here
should get a cut.

33:38.625 --> 33:39.539
[helicopter whirring overhead]

33:39.669 --> 33:41.193
BUCK:
Uh,

33:41.323 --> 33:42.977
sh-she already knew
where we were going.

33:43.108 --> 33:45.458
-[scoffs]
-Okay, fine, look,
we-we split it

33:45.545 --> 33:47.242
seven ways.
I don't know the exact math,

33:47.329 --> 33:48.635
-but that's enough.
-Uh, it's, uh,

33:48.765 --> 33:52.465
$714,285.

33:52.639 --> 33:54.206
71.4 cents.

33:54.380 --> 33:55.555
I don't know what to do
with the point-four.

33:55.729 --> 33:56.991
You-you can keep ours.

33:57.122 --> 33:59.298
We found the treasure.

33:59.428 --> 34:03.258
So let's go enjoy it.
Together. Come on.

34:07.001 --> 34:09.656
ATHENA:
It's got to be buried on one
of those little islands,

34:09.786 --> 34:11.571
the sandbars.

34:11.745 --> 34:13.268
I see some willow trees.

34:13.355 --> 34:15.096
But how will we know
which one it is?

34:15.227 --> 34:16.576
There's supposed to be a marker.

34:16.706 --> 34:18.665
"H" marks the spot.

34:18.795 --> 34:22.147
Or maybe we'll find someone else
already there,

34:22.321 --> 34:24.497
beating us to it.

34:25.672 --> 34:26.934
-Is that Probie?
-Guys!

34:27.065 --> 34:28.283
I found it!

34:29.937 --> 34:31.852
What's five million
divided by eight?

34:31.939 --> 34:34.202
I'm not doing any more math.

34:37.597 --> 34:39.599
Ravi, why don't you
do the honors since you

34:39.686 --> 34:41.905
-were here first?
-Pretty sure
we would've been here first

34:42.036 --> 34:44.343
were it not for the
extended round of negotiations.

34:44.473 --> 34:46.127
RAVI:
Wasn't as heavy as I thought.

34:46.258 --> 34:48.477
I'm guessing it's just a check,
not the actual jewels.

34:48.608 --> 34:51.176
I mean, who would be dumb enough
to do that? Right?

34:52.177 --> 34:54.309
â™ª

34:54.396 --> 34:56.006
You have got to be kidding me.

34:56.137 --> 34:58.008
-CHIMNEY: What?
-ATHENA: I think

34:58.139 --> 35:00.620
we need to have a word
with Mr. Harcourt.

35:07.409 --> 35:09.672
ATHENA:
Gate's already open.

35:09.759 --> 35:11.761
Never a good sign.

35:23.817 --> 35:25.775
Front door is open, too.

35:27.037 --> 35:28.561
ATHENA:
I'm gonna go in
and check it out.

35:28.648 --> 35:29.866
You all wait here.

35:29.997 --> 35:30.867
You are not going in there
alone.

35:30.998 --> 35:32.173
We're going in with you, Athena.

35:32.304 --> 35:34.001
Do any of you have a badge?

35:34.132 --> 35:35.568
And a gun?

35:36.569 --> 35:37.744
I didn't think so.

35:37.874 --> 35:38.962
Wait here.

35:42.792 --> 35:44.881
â™ª

36:03.900 --> 36:06.773
Guess he found his ending.

36:06.903 --> 36:08.340
RAVI:
Oh, my God.

36:08.470 --> 36:09.819
Is he...

36:09.950 --> 36:11.256
dead?

36:11.343 --> 36:12.735
-Most likely murdered.
-Didn't I say

36:12.822 --> 36:14.128
to wait outside?

36:14.259 --> 36:15.651
Why do you people never listen?

36:15.782 --> 36:18.785
[sirens wailing in distance]

36:18.915 --> 36:20.656
So that we could be your alibi?

36:30.318 --> 36:31.667
MAN: This is News 8
with breaking news.

36:31.841 --> 36:32.799
This is Taylor Kelly
reporting from outside

36:32.886 --> 36:34.279
Hollis Harcourt's mansion,

36:34.453 --> 36:36.498
where, in a twist worthy
of one of his novels,

36:36.629 --> 36:39.980
the famed author
has been found dead.

36:40.067 --> 36:41.416
Again.

36:41.503 --> 36:44.376
So, you all found
an empty treasure chest,

36:44.463 --> 36:46.508
drove down here
like an angry mob

36:46.639 --> 36:48.075
to confront him, now he's dead.

36:48.249 --> 36:50.382
But these facts are unrelated
to each other?

36:50.469 --> 36:53.646
Rick, he was dead
when we got here.

36:53.733 --> 36:56.214
-We didn't kill him.
-We just wanted to.
-Buck.

36:56.388 --> 36:57.998
-You're new.
-Yeah.

36:58.172 --> 36:59.434
I'm not really with them.

36:59.608 --> 37:02.002
Uh, I barely know these people,
so...

37:03.090 --> 37:04.265
-STAFFORD: Detective.
-Yeah.

37:04.439 --> 37:05.875
We got the security footage.

37:05.962 --> 37:06.963
Wasn't them.

37:08.878 --> 37:10.489
I didn't actually think it was.

37:10.663 --> 37:11.881
I was just...

37:12.012 --> 37:13.666
I was just doing my job.

37:13.753 --> 37:16.016
-Mm-hmm.
-And maybe enjoying
the moment a little.

37:16.190 --> 37:18.148
Take a look at this.

37:18.323 --> 37:21.195
She's wearing
a Zip Parcel uniform,

37:21.282 --> 37:23.110
but that is not one
of their trucks.

37:23.197 --> 37:23.806
CHIMNEY:
Delivery driver?

37:23.893 --> 37:25.852
This time of night?

37:26.026 --> 37:27.462
HEN:
Is she pregnant?

37:27.549 --> 37:29.334
She is.

37:29.464 --> 37:32.337
Where have I seen her before?

37:32.511 --> 37:36.079
My husband almost died!
More people are gonna die!

37:36.166 --> 37:37.516
ROMERO: And you knew
he had to be stopped,

37:37.690 --> 37:39.474
so maybe you took matters
into your own hands.

37:39.561 --> 37:40.606
I didn't kill him.

37:40.780 --> 37:41.781
Yeah.

37:41.911 --> 37:43.913
Been hearing that a lot tonight.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.264
But you went there in disguise,

37:46.351 --> 37:47.874
under false pretenses.

37:48.048 --> 37:49.528
Doesn't look good.

37:49.702 --> 37:52.531
-He was a horrible person.
-But you didn't kill him?

37:56.752 --> 37:58.711
You're not really delivering
anything.

37:58.885 --> 38:00.669
Where did you get the outfit?

38:00.843 --> 38:02.454
From my husband.

38:02.541 --> 38:03.803
My sweet,

38:03.933 --> 38:05.500
kind, normally
level-headed husband.

38:05.587 --> 38:07.241
-[exhales]
-Who almost lost his life

38:07.372 --> 38:08.895
because of your ridiculous
treasure hunt.

38:08.982 --> 38:10.723
If you're surprised
that your husband

38:10.810 --> 38:12.942
is a greedy, reckless man,
then maybe the truth is

38:13.029 --> 38:14.509
you didn't know him
as well as you thought.

38:14.596 --> 38:16.511
So... you're welcome.

38:16.598 --> 38:18.296
[scoffs]
He's not greedy.

38:18.383 --> 38:20.385
He wanted the money
for his family.

38:20.559 --> 38:22.909
We have a baby on the way,
and now he can't work.

38:22.996 --> 38:25.738
He might not be able to do his
job ever again thanks to you.

38:25.825 --> 38:26.695
And?

38:26.782 --> 38:27.827
You need to fix this.

38:27.914 --> 38:29.394
Make it right.

38:29.481 --> 38:31.352
Oh, oh, I see.
Okay, this is a-a shakedown.

38:31.439 --> 38:34.224
Got it. Um, who should I
make the check out to?

38:34.399 --> 38:36.836
How about, uh,
"Mrs. Take Your Sob Story

38:36.966 --> 38:38.577
And Empty Envelope
Somewhere Else"?

38:38.751 --> 38:40.143
Because I don't care.

38:40.230 --> 38:42.320
-Don't you touch me!
-No! Oh! [gasps]

38:42.407 --> 38:44.322
Oh, my God.
[stammers]

38:44.409 --> 38:45.714
That's a--
that's a crystal vase!

38:45.888 --> 38:46.846
It's valuable!

38:46.933 --> 38:48.326
So's my husband!

38:48.500 --> 38:49.675
Not to me.

38:52.112 --> 38:53.156
Stop it!

38:53.331 --> 38:54.375
What are you doing?!

38:54.549 --> 38:57.073
Stop it!
What are you do...

38:57.204 --> 38:58.379
I'm calling the...

38:58.553 --> 39:01.513
-[shattering]
-[groaning]

39:03.428 --> 39:04.559
-Oh, God.
-[groaning continues]

39:04.733 --> 39:06.213
Are you okay?

39:06.387 --> 39:07.649
DISPATCHER:
911. What's your emergency?

39:11.610 --> 39:14.700
-[gasping]
-This is 911. Is anyone there?

39:16.745 --> 39:18.530
Hello? Can you hear me?
Is anyone there?

39:18.617 --> 39:20.532
Hello?

39:22.751 --> 39:24.405
[whispers]:
Help.

39:24.492 --> 39:26.712
If you're there, press a button.

39:33.414 --> 39:34.676
Why didn't you say anything?

39:34.807 --> 39:36.199
You don't know that.

39:36.286 --> 39:37.940
Maybe it was just
a bad connection.

39:38.114 --> 39:39.464
[scoffs]

39:42.945 --> 39:44.599
[sighs]

39:44.686 --> 39:46.427
-[door closes]
-She's not wrong.

39:46.514 --> 39:47.776
She didn't technically kill him.

39:47.863 --> 39:49.648
The M.E. talked to his doctors.

39:49.735 --> 39:51.824
-He had a heart condition.
-Hollis let her into the house.

39:51.998 --> 39:54.609
So, no breaking
and entering charges.

39:54.696 --> 39:56.132
She just let him die.

39:56.263 --> 39:57.873
And the D.A. isn't gonna want
to touch this

39:58.047 --> 39:59.527
with a ten-foot pole.

39:59.701 --> 40:01.834
Everyone just wants
this whole thing to go away.

40:01.964 --> 40:03.749
I know I do.

40:05.185 --> 40:07.448
[honking in distance]

40:09.058 --> 40:10.669
But what do you think happened
to the money?

40:10.843 --> 40:12.671
Buck, there was no money.

40:12.845 --> 40:13.889
Hollis was just yanking
everyone's chain.

40:14.063 --> 40:15.151
BOBBY:
The whole city.

40:15.238 --> 40:16.196
And all of us.

40:16.283 --> 40:17.676
But why bury an empty chest?

40:17.850 --> 40:19.460
I mean,
why bury anything at all?

40:19.547 --> 40:21.070
You don't think the probie
double-crossed us, do you?

40:21.157 --> 40:24.204
At this point,
I don't trust anyone. [exhales]

40:27.294 --> 40:29.470
I mean, aside from you guys,
obviously.

40:29.644 --> 40:30.906
Everyone else,

40:31.080 --> 40:32.430
-they suck.
-TAYLOR: Huh.

40:32.604 --> 40:33.866
Especially that assistant.

40:33.953 --> 40:35.476
Jeremiah. You know, he swore

40:35.563 --> 40:38.044
to me he'd seen the treasure
with his own eyes.

40:38.131 --> 40:39.959
Guess he was in on the con
this whole time.

40:40.046 --> 40:44.659
No. He was just as surprised
as I was that Hollis was alive.

40:44.833 --> 40:46.444
JEREMIAH:
You're alive?

40:46.531 --> 40:47.749
I'm gonna kill you!

40:47.880 --> 40:48.707
ATHENA:
Uh...

40:48.881 --> 40:50.622
What are you thinking?

40:50.709 --> 40:53.189
Hollis didn't bury
an empty chest.

40:53.276 --> 40:55.322
Hollis didn't bury anything.

40:55.409 --> 40:57.846
Hollis wasn't the type
to get his hands dirty.

40:57.933 --> 40:59.631
You're the only one I trust.

40:59.718 --> 41:01.328
You have to do this for me.

41:01.415 --> 41:04.157
You just told me you're dying,
and now you want me

41:04.331 --> 41:08.074
to wade into the L.A. River
and bury $5 million?

41:08.161 --> 41:09.292
I need a minute.

41:09.467 --> 41:10.685
Jeremiah,

41:10.859 --> 41:12.339
I don't think
I have many minutes left.

41:12.513 --> 41:14.297
â™ª Snap your finger
and I'll...â™ª

41:14.384 --> 41:15.690
ATHENA:
So it was left up to Jeremiah,

41:15.777 --> 41:17.083
his loyal assistant,

41:17.257 --> 41:18.258
to do the dirty work.

41:18.432 --> 41:19.781
â™ª Your every wish...â™ª

41:19.912 --> 41:22.349
Who he conveniently left out
of his fake will.

41:22.523 --> 41:24.569
He had a fake will
for his fake death?

41:24.656 --> 41:26.135
And still didn't put
his assistant in it?

41:26.309 --> 41:27.485
That guy was
a real piece of work.

41:27.659 --> 41:29.138
ATHENA:
Hollis spent his life

41:29.225 --> 41:32.359
writing about the worst aspects
of human nature.

41:32.446 --> 41:34.579
HOLLIS:
Confirms everything
I ever thought about this town.

41:34.709 --> 41:37.320
Full of selfish, greedy morons.

41:37.495 --> 41:38.496
ATHENA:
And, still,

41:38.670 --> 41:40.367
he failed to remember

41:40.498 --> 41:42.456
that sometimes,

41:42.587 --> 41:43.936
when you push people too far...

41:44.110 --> 41:45.067
â™ª I'll do anything for youâ™ª

41:45.241 --> 41:46.678
...they snap.

41:46.765 --> 41:48.157
â™ª I'm your puppet.â™ª

41:48.288 --> 41:50.203
He left yesterday.

41:50.377 --> 41:52.858
Chartered a plane
to the Maldives.

41:54.120 --> 41:55.817
No extradition treaty.

41:55.948 --> 41:57.558
Do we even know
if he committed a crime?

41:57.732 --> 42:00.779
Yeah. What else
would you call it?

42:00.953 --> 42:02.345
A severance package.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.609
-[laughing]
-TAYLOR: Yeah.

42:05.697 --> 42:07.612
But I really think...

42:09.309 --> 42:10.310
Okay.

42:10.484 --> 42:12.747
Yeah, forget I asked.

42:12.834 --> 42:15.707
I'm guessing
no trip to the Maldives?

42:15.837 --> 42:19.624
They think "there was never
a treasure" is a better story.

42:19.711 --> 42:20.929
They want me to leave it there.

42:21.016 --> 42:24.367
Ah. I feel like
they don't know you very well.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.848
Mm. And you think you do?

42:26.979 --> 42:28.937
You know, I'm starting to.

42:29.024 --> 42:32.027
I also happen to think that,

42:32.201 --> 42:34.334
me and you, we, uh...

42:34.508 --> 42:36.205
we make a pretty good team.

42:36.292 --> 42:38.512
Buck, we didn't
find the treasure

42:38.643 --> 42:40.949
and you ended up
being questioned by the police.

42:41.036 --> 42:42.647
-[chuckles]
-For the second time.

42:42.777 --> 42:45.301
Yeah, but, uh, the rest of it...

42:46.302 --> 42:48.130
It was fun.

42:50.306 --> 42:52.613
I'm glad we're friends.

42:55.224 --> 42:56.574
[quietly]:
Friends.

42:56.661 --> 42:58.140
[claps softly]

42:58.314 --> 43:00.142
Great.
