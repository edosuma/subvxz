00:04.210 --> 00:06.201
The age-gap hiring policy
at movie theaters:

00:06.379 --> 00:09.473
They never hire anyone
between the ages of 15 and 80.

00:09.649 --> 00:12.675
Know what I mean? The girl
that sells you the tickets, she's 10.

00:12.852 --> 00:15.844
Then there's the guy that rips it,
he's 102.

00:16.021 --> 00:18.354
What happened in the middle?
Couldn't find anybody?

00:18.524 --> 00:21.823
It's like they want to show you
how life comes full circle.

00:22.194 --> 00:24.424
You're 15. You're selling tickets.
Then you leave.

00:24.597 --> 00:27.657
You go out, you have a family, kids,
marriage, career, grandchildren.

00:27.833 --> 00:30.028
Eighty years later, you're back
at the same theater...

00:30.202 --> 00:31.999
...3 feet away, ripping tickets.

00:32.171 --> 00:34.901
Took you 80 years
to move 3 feet.

00:40.346 --> 00:41.711
The show's delayed? Why?

00:41.881 --> 00:44.315
I don't know. Diane told me
to hold it for 15 minutes.

00:44.483 --> 00:45.973
But I got this all timed out.

00:46.152 --> 00:49.121
I got another spot across town at 9:50.
I'm not gonna make it.

00:49.288 --> 00:51.483
- I hear you, guy.
- And I'm doing Letterman Monday.

00:51.657 --> 00:53.750
You know, I gotta work out
the material.

00:53.926 --> 00:56.053
Let me see what I can do.

00:57.530 --> 01:01.193
Oh, no, Buckles? You're not putting
him on tonight, are you?

01:01.367 --> 01:04.302
No. He hangs around in case
somebody drops out.

01:04.470 --> 01:07.439
Look, why don't you come back
and do the 11:00 spot.

01:07.606 --> 01:11.565
I was supposed to meet my friends
to see this movie Checkmate at 10:30.

01:12.011 --> 01:15.742
All right, forget the movie.
I'll do the 11:00 spot. I'll be back.

01:15.915 --> 01:18.281
- Hey, Jer.
- Hey.

01:26.425 --> 01:28.893
Excuse me. Do you have a ticket?

01:29.061 --> 01:31.689
- No.
- Okay. Good.

01:34.100 --> 01:36.500
You missed your spot. It was 9:15.

01:36.669 --> 01:39.137
But, Maurice, I'm positive
you told me 9:50.

01:39.305 --> 01:42.900
In any event, I had no alternative
but to reassign your spot...

01:43.075 --> 01:46.977
...to one of your peers who possesses
a clearer understanding...

01:47.146 --> 01:49.740
...of our scheduling policies.

01:52.618 --> 01:54.609
- Jerry!
- What are you doing here?

01:54.787 --> 01:56.516
Hey, do you think this is funny?

01:56.956 --> 01:58.856
Why do they call it "athlete's foot"?

01:59.024 --> 02:00.855
You don't have to be
an athlete to get it.

02:01.026 --> 02:05.520
I mean, my father gets it all the time
and, believe me, he's no athlete.

02:05.698 --> 02:06.824
- I gotta go.
- Wait. Where?

02:06.999 --> 02:08.864
- The movies.
- I thought you told Kernis...

02:09.033 --> 02:10.763
...you were going back
to do the 11:00.

02:10.936 --> 02:13.530
I'm just gonna stop by
and tell my friends I can't make it.

02:13.706 --> 02:16.766
- Cool. I'll split a cab with you.
- I could be a while over there.

02:16.942 --> 02:20.776
I got time. It'll give us a chance to
get to know each other a little better.

02:26.552 --> 02:27.780
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:29.255 --> 02:31.314
- Where is everybody?
- Everybody's late.

02:31.490 --> 02:33.390
Because they know
I'll get in line early.

02:33.559 --> 02:36.255
I've been dying to see Checkmate.

02:36.428 --> 02:39.158
Well, if it's as good as
Ponce de León, I'll be happy.

02:39.331 --> 02:43.461
Ponce de León? Are you kidding me?
I hated that movie.

02:43.636 --> 02:46.036
Ponce de León?
But that was great.

02:46.205 --> 02:47.729
Oh, come on.

02:47.907 --> 02:49.772
That fountain of youth scene
at the end...

02:49.942 --> 02:51.534
...where they're splashing around...

02:51.710 --> 02:54.770
...and they go running over to the
mirror to see if it really worked.

02:54.947 --> 02:56.812
I mean, come on.

02:57.883 --> 02:59.373
It's so stupid.

02:59.552 --> 03:01.076
Let me tell you something:

03:01.253 --> 03:04.381
When Ponce looked in that mirror
and saw that he hadn't changed...

03:04.557 --> 03:08.584
...and that tear started to roll
down his cheek, I lost it.

03:08.761 --> 03:10.592
- Oh, there you are.
- Where have you been?

03:10.763 --> 03:12.856
Around the corner
at the Paradise Twin.

03:13.032 --> 03:16.024
- Well, I told you the Paragon.
- No, you said Paradise.

03:16.202 --> 03:19.433
- It's playing there too, you know.
- No. I would not have said Paradise.

03:19.605 --> 03:22.506
That's a twin theater. I want to see
this movie on a big screen.

03:22.675 --> 03:24.370
I'm gonna get a hot dog
at Papaya King.

03:24.543 --> 03:27.512
- You'll never make it back in time.
- I haven't had any dinner.

03:27.680 --> 03:29.341
You can get a hot dog
at the theater.

03:29.515 --> 03:32.006
I don't want a movie dog.
I want a Papaya King hot dog.

03:32.184 --> 03:34.118
Kramer, Jerry is gonna
be here any second.

03:34.286 --> 03:37.778
Then this line's gonna start moving,
and we'll end up in the front row.

03:37.957 --> 03:40.323
- Just save me a seat.
- No, I don't wanna save seats.

03:40.492 --> 03:41.754
Don't put me through that.

03:41.927 --> 03:44.327
I once had the fleece ripped out
of my winter coat...

03:44.496 --> 03:46.054
...in a seat-saving incident.

03:46.232 --> 03:48.700
- Give me my ticket, then.
- Well, I don't have them yet.

03:49.635 --> 03:51.102
You don't have them yet?

03:51.270 --> 03:52.897
Well, I'm in line to buy.

03:53.072 --> 03:55.870
No, George,
this is a ticket-holders' line.

03:56.041 --> 03:58.271
No, it's not.
It's the ticket-buyers' line.

03:58.444 --> 04:00.639
- Then how come we're not moving?
- Good question.

04:02.047 --> 04:05.039
Is this the ticket-holders' line
or the buyers'?

04:05.517 --> 04:06.950
Holders'.

04:07.119 --> 04:09.883
When I asked you before
if you had a ticket, you said no.

04:10.055 --> 04:12.819
I didn't. My friend was getting it.

04:13.125 --> 04:15.889
That's good.
It's good to be accurate.

04:16.060 --> 04:17.721
Stay here. I'll go get tickets.

04:18.264 --> 04:19.959
- Can you believe him?
- He spaced out.

04:21.466 --> 04:24.368
And how long would you have stood
in the ticket-holders' line?

04:24.937 --> 04:26.063
Yeah, exactly.

04:27.139 --> 04:28.606
It's sold out.

04:28.774 --> 04:31.902
Oh, real good, George.
Real good.

04:32.077 --> 04:33.942
Hey, I asked the guy
if he had a ticket.

04:34.113 --> 04:36.513
- All right, what time is it?
- Twenty after 10.

04:36.682 --> 04:38.775
They got one at the
Paradise at 10:45.

04:38.951 --> 04:42.216
No, I don't wanna go to
a miniplex multi-theater.

04:42.388 --> 04:44.686
It's the same movie.
What's the difference?

04:44.857 --> 04:46.154
No, it's not a theater.

04:46.325 --> 04:50.989
It's a room where they bring in POWs
to show them propaganda films.

04:51.931 --> 04:53.262
All right, I'm going.

04:53.432 --> 04:54.660
It's in Dolby.

04:54.833 --> 04:56.767
Well, what about Jerry?

04:56.936 --> 04:58.801
You go get the tickets.
I'll wait for him.

04:58.971 --> 05:01.462
- Terrific. All right, come on.
- All right.

05:09.214 --> 05:11.739
So then, when I was 12,
the whole family moved...

05:11.917 --> 05:14.909
...from Bensonhurst
to Sheepshead Bay.

05:15.487 --> 05:17.148
We were right on the water.

05:17.323 --> 05:20.656
The whole atmosphere
stunk from fish.

05:20.826 --> 05:23.124
You know that fishy smell
I'm talking about?

05:23.295 --> 05:25.229
Yeah, yeah. The fishy smell.

05:25.397 --> 05:27.058
To this day I won't eat fish.

05:27.232 --> 05:30.724
- Do you eat fish?
- Yes! Yes, I eat fish!

05:30.903 --> 05:33.303
- I don't know how you eat that crap.
- Take the Park.

05:33.472 --> 05:35.030
No, no, take 55th.

05:35.207 --> 05:36.765
No, there's beautiful homes there.

05:36.942 --> 05:39.809
There's lovely, talented,
attractive people.

05:39.979 --> 05:41.207
You'll thank me.

05:41.380 --> 05:43.712
Jerry, I want you to do me a favor:

05:43.882 --> 05:45.247
No more fish.

05:45.584 --> 05:47.552
Okay. I get your point.

05:47.786 --> 05:49.014
I have a point?

05:52.725 --> 05:54.852
- Got them.
- Beautiful.

05:55.027 --> 05:57.018
Hey, you know what else
is playing here?

05:57.196 --> 05:58.823
Rochelle Rochelle.

05:58.998 --> 06:00.625
- I wouldn't mind seeing that.
- Yeah.

06:00.799 --> 06:03.290
Men can sit through the most
pointless, boring movie...

06:03.469 --> 06:07.166
...if there's the slightest possibility
that a woman will take her top off.

06:08.474 --> 06:09.998
So, what's your point?

06:11.176 --> 06:12.666
By the way, you owe me $ 7.50.

06:13.178 --> 06:16.341
- All right. Can you break a 20?
- No. I don't have any change.

06:17.082 --> 06:18.515
Well, then I'll pay you later.

06:18.951 --> 06:21.442
Or I could take the 20,
and I could pay you later.

06:22.054 --> 06:23.351
Yeah, you could.

06:23.922 --> 06:25.253
Might be easier.

06:25.691 --> 06:28.683
Well, how's that easier? I mean,
then you would owe me $ 12.50...

06:28.861 --> 06:30.726
...instead of me owing you $ 7.50.

06:32.097 --> 06:34.691
- Either way.
- Yeah, it's the same thing.

06:36.235 --> 06:39.261
So can I have it?

06:40.506 --> 06:43.475
I tell you what, I'll get
the popcorn and the soda.

06:43.809 --> 06:46.209
What do you mean,
you'll get the popcorn and the soda?

06:46.745 --> 06:50.545
I will buy your popcorn and soda,
and we'll call it even.

06:50.716 --> 06:53.651
Tell you what. Give me the 20,
I'll buy you a popcorn and soda...

06:53.819 --> 06:57.448
...and I'll throw in a bonbons.
- George, you're sapping my strength.

06:57.623 --> 06:59.454
Come on. Go.

06:59.858 --> 07:01.416
What about Kramer and Jerry?

07:01.593 --> 07:03.584
I'll wait here for them.
You go save seats.

07:03.762 --> 07:06.230
Me? But that's three seats.
I can't save three seats.

07:06.398 --> 07:08.525
I told you about that guy
who tore up my coat.

07:08.700 --> 07:11.897
- Save them, go.
- No, but George...

07:18.410 --> 07:20.401
Fifty-Fifth Street. Great idea.

07:20.579 --> 07:22.774
Saturday night, theater traffic.
Good move.

07:22.948 --> 07:25.678
I wonder how lke Turner
would react in traffic.

07:25.851 --> 07:28.513
"You better move that car, girl,
before I bust you up."

07:28.687 --> 07:31.212
And what about Jose Feliciano?

07:31.390 --> 07:34.985
"It's not bad enough that I can't see,
I have to sit here for two hours.

07:35.160 --> 07:36.525
I don't think so."

07:36.695 --> 07:37.923
It can be anybody.

07:38.097 --> 07:41.362
People down through history
reacting in traffic.

07:41.533 --> 07:43.194
Franklin Roosevelt:

07:43.368 --> 07:46.633
- "Driver..."
- All right, all right. I got the bit.

07:46.972 --> 07:50.135
Jerry, I want you to have
this piece of material.

07:50.309 --> 07:52.209
That's nice of you.
I can't do the voices.

07:52.377 --> 07:54.345
Jerry, don't start up with me.

07:54.513 --> 07:56.481
I gotta get out of this cab.

07:56.648 --> 07:58.240
But, Jerry, we're riffing.

07:58.417 --> 08:03.411
No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring.
Do you understand the difference?

08:04.756 --> 08:07.384
Can you help me
get on The Tonight Show?

08:11.530 --> 08:12.656
No, these are saved.

08:12.831 --> 08:13.957
- All of them?
- Yeah.

08:14.133 --> 08:16.658
- You can't take four seats.
- What, is that a rule?

08:21.673 --> 08:23.231
- Are these your things?
- Yeah.

08:23.408 --> 08:26.036
Elaine, I can't wait anymore.
I'm gonna miss the beginning.

08:26.211 --> 08:29.305
Well, we'll take these seats.
Would you please remove your stuff?

08:29.481 --> 08:32.177
- No, no, they'll be here.
- But I am here. They are not.

08:32.351 --> 08:34.945
They're coming. George, listen,
run over to the Paragon...

08:35.120 --> 08:37.645
...and give Kramer the two tickets
so they can come in.

08:37.823 --> 08:39.313
These are taken. Taken.

08:39.491 --> 08:41.721
If you hurry back,
you won't miss the beginning.

08:42.427 --> 08:45.521
You go, and I could save the seats.
You don't like saving anyway.

08:45.831 --> 08:49.824
No, taken! Taken, taken.
I'm getting the hang of it.

08:50.002 --> 08:52.596
Why don't you give me the 20,
I'll stop and get change...

08:52.771 --> 08:54.830
...and then you and I can,
you know, settle up.

08:55.007 --> 08:56.338
Can we do this later, George?

08:57.476 --> 08:59.341
What's the point
of discussing it anymore.

08:59.511 --> 09:02.275
You'll give me the money
when you have it.

09:05.017 --> 09:06.678
I trust you.

09:08.000 --> 09:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:17.229 --> 09:18.457
Will you do me a favor?

09:18.764 --> 09:20.459
You see a guy who's
about 5 foot 11...

09:20.632 --> 09:22.930
...he's got a big head
and flared nostrils...

09:23.101 --> 09:25.899
...tell him his friend's gonna be
right back, okay?

09:27.839 --> 09:29.534
No, I'm sorry. These are taken.

09:29.708 --> 09:32.404
They're in the lobby buying popcorn.

09:32.578 --> 09:34.409
What are you doing?
These are taken!

09:34.580 --> 09:36.946
- Which one?
- These two and this one.

09:37.115 --> 09:38.980
No, don't come over here!
These are taken.

09:39.151 --> 09:41.051
Go! Go! These are taken.

09:41.220 --> 09:43.984
They're taken! They're taken!

09:44.456 --> 09:46.617
Oh, take them.

09:54.399 --> 09:56.390
Excuse me, have you
seen a guy with, like...

09:56.568 --> 09:59.731
...a horse face, big teeth
and a pointed nose?

10:00.038 --> 10:02.165
- Flared nostrils?
- Yeah.

10:02.341 --> 10:04.138
Nope. Haven't seen him.

10:12.150 --> 10:14.914
Jerry, could you do me
a personal favor?

10:15.087 --> 10:18.079
And if I'm out of line,
please let me know.

10:18.257 --> 10:21.920
Could I keep my trench coat
in your closet for a few months?

10:22.094 --> 10:23.584
Your trench coat in my closet?

10:23.762 --> 10:26.128
Jerry, my closet is packed to the gills.

10:26.298 --> 10:27.993
I'm afraid to open the door.

10:28.166 --> 10:29.758
Just for a few months.

10:29.935 --> 10:31.994
It'll make all the difference
in the world.

10:32.170 --> 10:34.001
I can't keep your coat in my closet.

10:34.172 --> 10:36.663
- I'm sorry you feel that way.
- Well, that's how I feel.

10:36.842 --> 10:39.640
Hey, your friends aren't here.

10:40.212 --> 10:43.545
They must be inside. I'm gonna run in
and tell them I can't make the movie.

10:43.715 --> 10:47.446
We should go see Rochelle Rochelle.
I hear it's really hot.

10:47.619 --> 10:50.554
- No, thanks. Maybe some other time.
- Really? Do you mean that?

10:51.089 --> 10:52.386
No, I don't.

10:52.557 --> 10:54.787
But you like the athlete's-foot bit,
right?

10:54.960 --> 10:58.123
No. No. I was kidding.
It was terrible.

10:58.297 --> 10:59.764
Here you go. I'll see you later.

10:59.931 --> 11:02.126
- Do you want me to wait for you?
- No. Don't wait.

11:02.301 --> 11:05.395
Jerry, I'll wait just to make sure
you get in, that's all.

11:05.570 --> 11:07.765
I got friends inside
I need to get a message to.

11:07.939 --> 11:09.998
You mind if I walk through
real quick?

11:10.776 --> 11:12.141
Go ahead.

11:12.311 --> 11:14.142
Bye-bye.

11:14.646 --> 11:16.546
Hey, did that guy show up?

11:16.715 --> 11:19.878
The guy with the horse face
and the big teeth?

11:20.052 --> 11:22.486
No, the guy with the big head
and the flared nostrils.

11:22.854 --> 11:24.788
Haven't seen him.

11:25.457 --> 11:27.891
There was a short guy with glasses...

11:28.060 --> 11:31.223
...looked like Humpty-Dumpty
with a melon head.

11:31.396 --> 11:33.091
But he left.

11:35.400 --> 11:38.164
So I got home,
and he was vacuuming.

11:38.337 --> 11:40.134
I mean, he's 12 years old.

11:40.305 --> 11:43.399
Who else but my Alan
would do something like that?

11:43.575 --> 11:47.136
And then last night,
he put on my high heels.

11:47.312 --> 11:49.075
He put on such a show for us.

11:49.247 --> 11:52.341
He was dancing around,
lip-synching to A Chorus Line.

11:52.517 --> 11:54.075
I mean, you can see
he's got talent.

11:54.252 --> 11:56.311
Excuse me. Excuse me.

11:56.488 --> 11:57.921
What's the problem?

11:58.090 --> 11:59.523
You're talking.

11:59.691 --> 12:02.421
It's the coming attractions.

12:02.594 --> 12:05.154
So anyway, he sings, he dances.

12:05.330 --> 12:07.059
And you know what
he's gotten into now?

12:07.232 --> 12:09.928
He is cooking. He does a great...

12:11.803 --> 12:13.464
Ticket, sir?

12:13.805 --> 12:16.069
I just went out.
I went to look for my friend.

12:16.241 --> 12:17.469
Do you have your stub?

12:17.642 --> 12:19.542
My stub?

12:20.112 --> 12:22.080
Who keeps the stub?

12:22.247 --> 12:24.511
No one holds on to the stub.

12:24.683 --> 12:28.551
I'm going to the movies for 25 years,
nobody ever asked me for the stub.

12:29.321 --> 12:32.085
- You don't remember me?
- It's a big city, sir.

12:32.257 --> 12:33.588
I went in with a pretty woman.

12:33.759 --> 12:36.455
You know, short, big wall of hair,
face like a frying pan.

12:36.628 --> 12:37.890
Nope.

12:40.832 --> 12:43.562
- I can't find it.
- I can't let you in without your stub.

12:45.237 --> 12:49.401
All right. Here. It's my friend's ticket.

13:00.752 --> 13:02.549
Elaine?

13:04.689 --> 13:08.022
- Elaine?
- Sit down!

13:09.661 --> 13:11.822
- Elaine?
- Hey, shut up!

13:11.997 --> 13:13.259
I'm looking for my friend.

13:13.432 --> 13:15.263
Check the bathroom.
You're bothering us.

13:15.434 --> 13:17.766
I know my friend's here.
What do you want me to do?

13:17.936 --> 13:19.198
You can shut up!

13:21.840 --> 13:24.832
- Elaine?
- Shut up!

13:32.417 --> 13:33.941
Elaine?

13:34.252 --> 13:36.117
Elaine?

13:36.721 --> 13:39.986
The Village Voice calls it
a masterpiece.

13:40.158 --> 13:44.458
A young woman's strange, erotic
journey from Milan to Minsk.

13:44.629 --> 13:50.397
It's a story about life and love
and becoming a woman.

13:50.569 --> 13:52.764
Rochelle Rochelle.

13:52.938 --> 13:56.066
Now playing at the Paradise Two.

14:24.469 --> 14:25.959
Thank you.

14:26.304 --> 14:27.703
Can I have a medium Diet Coke?

14:27.873 --> 14:30.740
- You want the medium or middle size?
- What's the difference?

14:30.909 --> 14:33.207
Well, we have three sizes:
medium, large and jumbo.

14:33.378 --> 14:34.709
What happened to the small?

14:34.880 --> 14:36.575
There is no small. Small's medium.

14:37.182 --> 14:38.672
So, what's medium?

14:38.850 --> 14:40.374
Medium's large,
and large is jumbo.

14:40.819 --> 14:43.287
- Okay, give me the large.
- That's medium.

14:43.755 --> 14:46.121
Right. Yeah.
Can I have a small popcorn?

14:46.291 --> 14:48.623
There is no small.
Child-size is small.

14:48.793 --> 14:51.023
- What's medium?
- Adult.

14:51.363 --> 14:55.493
- Do adults ever order the child-size?
- Not usually.

14:55.767 --> 14:57.928
- Okay, give me the adult.
- Do you want butter?

14:58.103 --> 15:00.196
- Is it real butter?
- It's butter flavoring.

15:00.372 --> 15:02.033
Yeah, well, what is it made of?

15:02.207 --> 15:03.765
It's yellow.

15:10.682 --> 15:14.743
Thanks. Thank you. You don't know
how long I've been waiting out there.

15:14.920 --> 15:18.219
Very busy tonight. Very busy.
Where you go?

15:18.390 --> 15:20.324
Forty-Fourth and 9th.

15:20.492 --> 15:23.290
- Have you got a cigarette?
- No.

15:23.862 --> 15:25.454
Ticket, sir?

15:25.830 --> 15:28.128
We've just been through this.

15:28.300 --> 15:31.997
You don't remember? We just had
this exact conversation a minute ago.

15:32.170 --> 15:33.467
I need to see your stub.

15:35.840 --> 15:38.900
I got the stub. I got the stub.

15:39.077 --> 15:42.012
I put it right in my pocket.
I got the...

15:42.514 --> 15:44.505
I'm telling you, I got the stub.
I just...

15:44.683 --> 15:48.278
- I don't know where it is.
- I can't let you in without your stub.

15:48.453 --> 15:52.150
You just let me in.
We just did this a minute ago!

15:55.160 --> 15:58.357
All right. Okay. There.
There you go, okay?

15:58.530 --> 16:00.395
That's my other friend's ticket.
Happy now?

16:00.565 --> 16:03.625
You got two tickets.
Two of my friends.

16:08.473 --> 16:09.701
Ticket, sir?

16:09.874 --> 16:13.275
No, see, my friend bought me a ticket.
See, I'm late. She's already inside.

16:13.445 --> 16:15.140
- Go ahead. Enjoy the movie.
- Thanks.

16:22.287 --> 16:24.118
- What is it, Your Majesty?
- Anyone asks...

16:24.322 --> 16:26.313
- Is that seat taken?
- It's all yours.

16:26.491 --> 16:28.925
When I tell you something,
you damn better well listen.

16:29.094 --> 16:32.120
- I'm getting tired of these questions.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

16:32.297 --> 16:36.233
I'm sorry, Grendel, I...
I've been very taxed lately.

16:36.668 --> 16:38.863
Yeah, I'm very sorry.
You give me a few minutes.

16:39.037 --> 16:41.028
I have to stop for gasoline.

16:41.206 --> 16:43.333
Gasoline? Can't you get it
after you drop me off?

16:43.508 --> 16:48.138
No. Impossible.
It is on empty. See.

16:48.313 --> 16:51.077
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

16:53.318 --> 16:55.411
What happened to my seat?

16:55.587 --> 16:57.487
Oh, my God, where was I?

16:57.656 --> 17:00.557
- Hey, sit down. I can't see.
- Get out of the way.

17:00.725 --> 17:01.987
I can't find my seat.

17:02.160 --> 17:04.924
- Just move!
- No, you move!

17:05.096 --> 17:07.257
Get the hell out of here!

17:10.801 --> 17:12.929
Come, come, you're soaking wet.
Come in.

17:13.104 --> 17:15.163
My name is Rochelle.
I'm from Milan.

17:15.339 --> 17:17.273
I'm supposed to visit
my relatives in Minsk.

17:17.442 --> 17:18.772
Yes. Come by the fire.

17:18.943 --> 17:21.036
Take off those wet clothes.
You'll catch cold.

17:21.212 --> 17:25.046
My hands are so cold,
I can barely get these buttons open.

17:26.117 --> 17:29.211
That's much better.
Much, much better.

17:35.794 --> 17:39.389
Listen, I just went
to go get popcorn and...

17:39.564 --> 17:43.022
God. I just went to go
get popcorn, okay...

17:43.201 --> 17:46.034
...and somebody took my seat,
and my coat is in there.

17:46.204 --> 17:47.796
There's a seat in the front row.

17:47.972 --> 17:49.872
No, no, I can't sit in the front row.

17:50.041 --> 17:51.531
You're gonna have to wait then.

17:51.710 --> 17:54.076
I can't stand around here
for two hours.

17:54.245 --> 17:56.645
I can let you see
Rochelle Rochelle.

17:57.782 --> 17:59.579
Thanks.

18:01.386 --> 18:02.683
Hey, listen, by the way...

18:02.854 --> 18:05.789
...have you seen
a tall, lanky doofus...

18:05.957 --> 18:09.916
...with a bird face and hair like
the Bride of Frankenstein?

18:10.462 --> 18:12.225
Haven't seen him.

18:12.797 --> 18:14.162
Okay.

18:16.301 --> 18:17.768
Let's go. I'm gonna miss my spot.

18:17.936 --> 18:19.528
Yes, yes, we go. We go.

18:19.704 --> 18:21.968
One minute. I run across
the street for cigarettes.

18:22.140 --> 18:24.131
I don't have time.
I'm gonna miss my spot.

18:24.309 --> 18:27.608
No, no. We go very soon.

18:28.980 --> 18:31.244
I didn't know you enjoyed chess,
Your Majesty.

18:31.416 --> 18:32.815
Why wouldn't I?

18:32.984 --> 18:35.452
Well, because the king
is always in jeopardy.

18:35.620 --> 18:37.485
Yes, but it's only a game.

18:37.655 --> 18:41.352
Yes, of course. Only a game.

18:46.898 --> 18:49.662
- Hey, did I make it?
- Sorry.

18:49.834 --> 18:53.361
Great. That's great. What a night.

18:53.538 --> 18:55.062
Pat Buckles, ladies and gentlemen.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.936
Another round of applause
for Pat Buckles.

18:58.109 --> 18:59.542
Good set.

18:59.711 --> 19:01.042
You got my spot?

19:01.212 --> 19:04.443
- That athlete's-foot bit killed.
- Really?

19:04.616 --> 19:07.710
- You think I need to lose some weight?
- Weight? No.

19:07.886 --> 19:09.820
You just need some height.

19:09.988 --> 19:12.889
Jerry, don't start up with me.
What are you doing now?

19:13.057 --> 19:14.888
What am I doing?
My whole night's ruined.

19:15.059 --> 19:17.186
I didn't do any sets.
I didn't go to the movies.

19:17.362 --> 19:19.853
Come on. We can still catch
most of Rochelle Rochelle.

19:20.031 --> 19:21.191
Rochelle Rochelle?

19:21.599 --> 19:26.036
A young girl's strange, erotic
journey from Milan to Minsk.

19:26.337 --> 19:27.895
Minsk?

19:29.374 --> 19:30.705
My father was a shoemaker.

19:30.875 --> 19:32.866
He worked hard,
and we didn't have much money.

19:33.044 --> 19:35.342
Rochelle, Rochelle,
what are we going to do with you?

19:35.513 --> 19:37.913
- I'm going away tomorrow.
- Where? Where are you going?

19:38.082 --> 19:39.811
I want to go with you.
Take me with you.

19:39.984 --> 19:41.281
Well, don't be a silly goose.

19:41.452 --> 19:44.546
But I've never seen Minsk. I hear
there's so much hustle and bustle.

19:44.722 --> 19:47.190
You're being absurd.
Leave me alone.

19:47.592 --> 19:51.050
- Rochelle, Rochelle, do you know...?
- Give me a break!

19:53.698 --> 19:55.563
Elaine?

19:56.668 --> 19:58.602
- Jerry.
- Elaine.

19:58.770 --> 20:00.897
- Shut up.
- Jerry?

20:01.773 --> 20:04.173
- George?
- Elaine?

20:04.342 --> 20:05.570
George.

20:05.743 --> 20:07.973
- But where's Kramer?
- Will you shut up?

20:08.146 --> 20:10.774
I don't know.
Does this movie stink or what?

20:10.949 --> 20:13.440
Let's get out of here. I'll see you.

20:13.618 --> 20:14.880
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

20:15.053 --> 20:18.420
Jerry, take the coat.
Please. One month.

20:18.590 --> 20:20.820
I don't want the coat.

20:21.693 --> 20:25.424
Jerry, call me when you get home,
so I know you're okay.

20:25.864 --> 20:28.424
- What happened to you?
- I missed you at the other theater.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.727
Then I missed my set,
and I had nothing to do.

20:30.902 --> 20:32.836
Man. Look at this.

20:33.004 --> 20:34.562
I sat in gum.

20:34.739 --> 20:35.933
What happened to Checkmate?

20:36.107 --> 20:39.599
Oh, I went out to get popcorn,
and some creep took my seat.

20:39.777 --> 20:41.642
Hey, by the way,
you owe me $ 7.50.

20:41.813 --> 20:45.214
- But I didn't even use the ticket.
- I still paid for it.

20:45.650 --> 20:47.914
- I only have a 20.
- Hi.

20:48.086 --> 20:49.747
- Hey!
- What happened to you?

20:49.921 --> 20:53.357
That's my coat. Give me that.
Where did you get that?

20:53.524 --> 20:54.957
It was on the seat.

20:55.126 --> 20:56.525
You took my seat?

20:56.694 --> 20:59.527
- You owe me $ 7.50.
- Yeah. Right.

21:00.198 --> 21:02.826
What is this stain?

21:03.001 --> 21:06.596
It's yellow mustard.
Can you break a 20?

21:06.771 --> 21:10.468
But I always get confused
in the movie theater by the plot.

21:10.642 --> 21:14.339
It's embarrassing to have to admit,
but I'm the one you see...

21:14.512 --> 21:17.970
...in the parking lot, after the movie,
talking with his friends, going:

21:18.149 --> 21:21.915
"You mean, that was the same guy
from the beginning?"

21:24.322 --> 21:28.418
Nobody will explain it to you.
In the theater, you can't find out.

21:28.593 --> 21:30.788
Why did they kill that guy?

21:31.529 --> 21:33.463
Why did they kill him?

21:34.432 --> 21:37.492
Who was that guy?
Who was that guy?

21:37.835 --> 21:41.032
I thought he was with them.
Wasn't he with them?

21:41.205 --> 21:43.935
Why would they kill him
if he was with them?

21:45.343 --> 21:47.811
Oh, he wasn't really with them.

21:47.979 --> 21:50.106
I thought he was with them.

21:51.416 --> 21:53.577
It's a good thing they killed him.
