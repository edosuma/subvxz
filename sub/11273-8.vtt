WEBVTT

00:07.500 --> 00:09.331
You sure you don't wanna
have another round?

00:09.584 --> 00:11.939
Not me, pal. Let's get out of here.

00:12.211 --> 00:13.929
What's the damage, Mac?

00:14.170 --> 00:15.683
Oh, just let me figure it up here.

00:17.589 --> 00:19.659
That'll be 27.50.

00:19.924 --> 00:21.243
Ouch. You sure?

00:22.175 --> 00:24.291
Yep, you two gentlemen
had four peach daiquiris

00:24.551 --> 00:26.587
and three crème de menthe frappés.

00:29.971 --> 00:32.769
Something funny, dipstick?

00:38.434 --> 00:40.823
In the paper this morning, yeah,
it seems that, oh,

00:41.102 --> 00:43.662
the Sarge got tricked
by Beetle Bailey again.

00:43.937 --> 00:46.610
See, Beetle put some itching powder
in his shorts.

00:47.606 --> 00:52.157
Oh, we thought that maybe
you was laughing at our drink order.

00:52.525 --> 00:55.642
Oh, on the contrary.
No, no, no--

00:55.944 --> 00:59.095
Woody, let me have another mocha
froth, will you? And keep them coming.

02:13.600 --> 02:16.672
Hey, guess who's gonna interview me
on the radio tonight?

02:17.019 --> 02:19.010
Someone with a taste for adventure.

02:19.272 --> 02:20.785
- Dave Richards, my old buddy.
- Hey.

02:21.024 --> 02:23.618
And a 2-by-4 for a brain.

02:23.901 --> 02:25.892
I need Dewar's rocks, please.

02:26.195 --> 02:27.548
What's your big problem with Dave?

02:27.780 --> 02:29.372
I mean, ever since he came in
this place,

02:29.616 --> 02:30.935
you've been badmouthing the guy.

02:31.158 --> 02:34.195
For some strange reason,
I find it hard to respect a man

02:34.495 --> 02:38.408
with the bumper sticker
"Honk if you're horny."

02:39.292 --> 02:43.080
- That's pretty good.
- Yeah. Honk, honk, honk!

02:43.713 --> 02:45.783
Oh, there's news.

02:46.132 --> 02:48.521
Hey, Sam, what time do you have
to be at the radio station?

02:48.801 --> 02:51.520
No, it's a phone interview.
You know, it's that sports talk show

02:51.804 --> 02:53.476
that Dave does after
the Red Sox games.

02:53.722 --> 02:56.475
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!

02:56.767 --> 03:00.965
- What do you say, Norm?
- Well, I never met a beer I didn't drink.

03:02.063 --> 03:05.100
And down it goes, huh?

03:05.484 --> 03:07.475
- We missed you last night, buddy.
- You did?

03:07.736 --> 03:09.613
- Yeah.
- Well, Vera and I went out dancing

03:09.863 --> 03:11.740
with the Henshaws.
The next-door neighbours.

03:11.990 --> 03:13.628
- Oh, what, again?
- Normie, dancing?

03:13.867 --> 03:15.937
- Yeah.
- I didn't think you liked walking.

03:16.202 --> 03:19.239
You kidding? I love dancing.
I could watch for hours.

03:19.539 --> 03:21.291
You don't dance yourself?

03:22.292 --> 03:27.320
Vera's the dancer in our family.
She even has dancer's buns, Sammy.

03:27.755 --> 03:30.349
Too bad they're on her calves, though.
You know, it's kind of...

03:30.633 --> 03:34.023
So, Normie, who was the--?
Who was Vera dancing with then?

03:35.012 --> 03:36.570
- The guy, Ron Henshaw.
- Oh, yeah?

03:36.806 --> 03:38.239
- Yeah. Good dancer.
- Oh, is he?

03:38.475 --> 03:40.943
Well, they dance
the slow dances, do they?

03:41.227 --> 03:43.741
Yeah, a few times.
Why do you ask, Cliff?

03:44.021 --> 03:46.979
Oh, no reason, no reason.
But you know, during the slow dances,

03:47.274 --> 03:49.834
certain parts of the body
rub up against one another.

03:51.237 --> 03:53.797
You know, thigh touches thigh,
purely by accident.

03:54.073 --> 03:56.428
Before you know it,
you're hosing them off like dogs.

03:57.702 --> 03:59.294
It's good clean fun, all right, Cliffy?

03:59.536 --> 04:01.527
Yeah, well, I know which way
the wind blows.

04:01.788 --> 04:04.382
Yeah, usually out of your mouth.

04:07.378 --> 04:08.970
Cheers.

04:09.420 --> 04:10.739
Oh, yeah, he's right here.

04:10.964 --> 04:12.556
Sam, it's some guy
from the radio station.

04:12.799 --> 04:14.152
Dave's ready to go on the air!

04:14.426 --> 04:16.576
All right, all right, I'll be in my office.
Pipe down.

04:16.970 --> 04:19.689
I can't believe I'm talking
to a real radio station.

04:20.807 --> 04:23.560
Hey, hey, listen, while I've got you,
could you please play "Roxanne"

04:23.852 --> 04:25.729
and dedicate it to my girl?

04:25.978 --> 04:28.048
No, no, her name's Beth.

04:28.314 --> 04:30.111
But I don't think there's
a song called "Beth."

04:30.358 --> 04:33.794
Oh, hi, Sam. Oh, right,
I'll hang up. Goodbye.

04:34.112 --> 04:36.910
Well, it's not really goodbye
because we're not actually--

04:37.198 --> 04:40.156
Right now? Yes, okay.
They're ready.

04:41.494 --> 04:43.132
- What's the score?
- What's the line?

04:43.371 --> 04:44.724
- Who's ahead?
- Who's behind?

04:44.955 --> 04:48.311
Hey, let's ask Dave!

04:48.626 --> 04:51.459
Who's behind? Come on,
can we say that on the air?

04:53.339 --> 04:56.058
Yes, it's me, Dave Richards,
with Sports Shorts.

04:56.342 --> 04:58.298
Well, we don't have much time
because the Red Sox

04:58.552 --> 05:01.430
were involved in another
long, boring extra-inning game.

05:01.722 --> 05:03.713
So let's get right to tonight's guest.

05:03.974 --> 05:05.487
He's former Red Sox relief pitcher

05:05.726 --> 05:09.036
and one of my buds, Sam Malone.
How you doing?

05:10.772 --> 05:12.808
Sure am, Dave. How are you?

05:13.066 --> 05:15.534
- Just great. And you?
- Couldn't be better.

05:15.819 --> 05:17.730
That's great to hear.
Boy, we've had some fun...

05:17.988 --> 05:19.979
Where does one send
for a transcript?

05:20.282 --> 05:22.637
Well, I think we've hogged
the airwaves long enough, Sam.

05:22.909 --> 05:25.901
So let's open up those phone lines
for you listeners out there.

05:26.205 --> 05:28.924
Got a question you've been dying
to ask Sam Malone?

05:29.207 --> 05:30.799
Well, here's your chance.

05:33.462 --> 05:36.295
Former major league great
Mayday Malone.

05:38.967 --> 05:43.040
All the lines are clear,
and it is a toll-free call.

05:43.805 --> 05:47.400
It doesn't have to be about baseball.
Anything at all. Anything.

05:47.725 --> 05:49.522
Hey, we've got a call.
You're on the Shorts.

05:49.768 --> 05:51.838
Hey, Sam, where'd
you put the olives?

05:53.314 --> 05:54.827
Woody-- Woody, get off the--

05:55.066 --> 05:56.419
Get off the phone!

05:57.485 --> 05:59.441
- He said, "Anything at all."
- Here's another one.

05:59.695 --> 06:01.253
- Go ahead.
- Sam, you were known as

06:01.488 --> 06:03.240
quite a ladies' man
during your playing days.

06:03.490 --> 06:06.004
Are women more impressed
by a man in a baseball uniform?

06:06.284 --> 06:08.354
Well, actually I found women
were a lot more impressed

06:08.620 --> 06:11.373
when I was out of my uniform,
if you get my drift.

06:11.665 --> 06:13.018
Hey.

06:13.250 --> 06:16.526
No, seriously, you know,
a lot of the chicks I dated

06:16.837 --> 06:18.634
know nothing about
the game of baseball at all.

06:18.881 --> 06:22.237
You know, in fact, one former
love bunny actually brought a book

06:22.551 --> 06:24.860
to a Red Sox game to pass time
between pitches.

06:25.136 --> 06:28.572
- "Love bunny"?
- A book? You mean, like, to read?

06:28.890 --> 06:30.926
I swear to God, Dave.

06:33.603 --> 06:37.391
Gee, I wonder who
that was, Diane.

06:37.733 --> 06:40.406
--his grandchildren about that.
Anyway, this is Dave Richards

06:40.694 --> 06:43.049
saying, "Be a sport.
Don't be a jerk. " Goodbye.

06:43.321 --> 06:45.198
Great show.

06:45.448 --> 06:48.121
Hey, do you love me, public?

06:53.247 --> 06:55.158
Love bunny?

06:57.418 --> 06:59.056
What's wrong with that?

06:59.295 --> 07:02.287
How dare you callously
and cruelly lump me in

07:02.590 --> 07:05.184
with the other conglomeration
of Twinkies

07:05.467 --> 07:09.506
that constitutes your sexual past.

07:10.556 --> 07:13.548
There's just no pleasing that woman.

07:19.064 --> 07:21.578
- Hello, Norm.
- Oh, Phyllis.

07:21.859 --> 07:24.168
- What are you doing here?
- Well, I took the chance

07:24.444 --> 07:27.004
- I might find you here.
- Whoa, what are the odds?

07:28.865 --> 07:30.821
You guys, this is Phyllis Henshaw.

07:31.076 --> 07:33.510
- Hi.
- So where's Ron?

07:33.787 --> 07:35.220
I don't know.

07:37.666 --> 07:40.180
Could we talk privately?

07:41.336 --> 07:44.009
Sure, yeah. Just follow me here.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.492
- Can I get you anything?
- No. No, thank you.

07:46.757 --> 07:49.317
What's up?

07:50.511 --> 07:54.584
Norm, I've been trying to think
of an easy way to say this,

07:54.933 --> 07:57.163
but I can't.

07:57.518 --> 07:59.873
I think Vera and Ron
are having an affair.

08:01.773 --> 08:03.172
Vera and Ron?

08:06.194 --> 08:08.662
Did you guys all get that back there?

08:09.613 --> 08:12.252
That's just great. How about you guys?
Did you get that, everyone?

08:12.533 --> 08:15.172
Come on, let's just get away
from the peanut gallery here.

08:17.704 --> 08:19.376
This is kind of hard to believe, Phyllis.

08:19.623 --> 08:21.181
I mean, what makes you
think they are?

08:21.458 --> 08:24.097
- Oh, Norm, come on. You're not blind.
- What? What?

08:24.378 --> 08:27.450
Haven't you seen the way they look
at each other when they're dancing?

08:27.756 --> 08:30.190
And I don't have to tell you
how attractive Vera is.

08:30.467 --> 08:32.981
No, you certainly don't.

08:34.011 --> 08:36.606
And Ron's always going over
to "borrow" things from you.

08:36.890 --> 08:40.200
Yeah, but-- Well, all right, yeah.

08:40.519 --> 08:43.477
Now, Vera said that he came over
yesterday to borrow a power drill,

08:43.770 --> 08:48.242
- but I really...
- Norm, we have a power drill.

08:50.195 --> 08:52.390
Variable speed?

08:53.782 --> 08:55.500
Yes.

08:55.741 --> 08:57.811
- Cordless?
- Oh, my God!

08:58.077 --> 09:00.033
Phyllis, this doesn't necessarily mean
anything.

09:00.288 --> 09:03.166
Well, we have to find out. I think we
ought to hire a private detective.

09:03.458 --> 09:05.733
No, I think you're jumping
the gun a little bit.

09:06.002 --> 09:07.355
- Oh, are we?
- Yes. Yeah, I do.

09:07.586 --> 09:10.180
Well, Ron told me he'd be home
all night. Let's just see if he is.

09:10.464 --> 09:13.536
Phyllis, I'm sure-- Look-- Get--

09:13.843 --> 09:15.799
So, what's up, buddy?

09:16.053 --> 09:17.805
It's probably nothing, I hope.

09:18.055 --> 09:20.205
Oh, come on, Norm.
Fill us in, will you?

09:20.474 --> 09:22.146
I mean, we're--
We're your friends here.

09:22.392 --> 09:25.668
We're sensitive and caring,
and our only concern is your support.

09:25.980 --> 09:27.254
You know that, Norman.

09:27.481 --> 09:29.631
Well, all right, how much did you
overhear so far?

09:29.900 --> 09:32.368
Well, everything but the location

09:32.653 --> 09:35.087
where they're satisfying
their pagan lust.

09:37.491 --> 09:40.608
No, this just can't be true, Mr Peterson.
They wouldn't do that.

09:40.911 --> 09:43.220
I mean, they're both married,
for Pete's sake.

09:43.496 --> 09:45.726
How old are you?

09:47.959 --> 09:50.109
Well, what--? What happened?

09:50.378 --> 09:51.731
Ron's not home.

09:51.963 --> 09:55.273
- Hire a private dick, Norm.
- Hey, my cousin Santo's a gumshoe,

09:55.591 --> 09:56.910
- and a great one.
- Great, great.

09:57.135 --> 09:59.365
He's professional, thorough
and a master of disguise.

09:59.637 --> 10:01.434
- I'm sure he is.
- Not just as people either,

10:01.681 --> 10:05.435
but things. Furniture.
I mean, he could be here right now.

10:05.769 --> 10:09.557
Norman, I think it's a mistake.
Don't give in to suspicion.

10:09.897 --> 10:12.172
Baloney! Hire Santo.
Better safe than sorry.

10:12.901 --> 10:15.256
- No, Norm...
- Norman, trust-- Trust--

10:16.237 --> 10:18.114
Who are these people?

10:18.364 --> 10:21.276
All right. Wait a minute. Just--
Would you wait a minute, now?

10:21.575 --> 10:26.649
Phyllis, you may not know about Ron,
but Vera happens to love me, all right?

10:27.039 --> 10:29.872
And I certainly love her.
I'm gonna call her right this minute.

10:30.167 --> 10:31.725
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna tell her that.

10:31.961 --> 10:34.919
- Yeah.
- She better be there to hear it.

10:35.380 --> 10:36.893
She will.

10:42.429 --> 10:44.340
Oh, hi, honey.

10:45.849 --> 10:50.684
No, nothing, nothing, I just, actually,
called to tell you that I love you.

10:51.063 --> 10:56.057
The usual time.
All right, fine. Yeah, bye. Bye.

10:58.904 --> 11:02.260
She said she's just sitting
home alone listening to records.

11:02.573 --> 11:04.882
Oh, I could hear Johnny Mathis
singing in the background.

11:05.159 --> 11:06.797
There you go. I knew it.

11:07.036 --> 11:09.266
Now, that's good news,
isn't it, Mr Peterson?

11:09.538 --> 11:11.017
Yeah.

11:11.416 --> 11:14.613
It'd even be better if we had
a Johnny Mathis album.

11:16.754 --> 11:18.870
We have one.

11:20.700 --> 11:23.339
All right, Carla, call your cousin.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.058
Hey. Did you enjoy your dinner?

11:41.756 --> 11:44.350
Hey. Hey, listen.

11:45.551 --> 11:47.143
Excuse me, miss?

11:47.803 --> 11:49.953
Are you or are you not
speaking to me?

11:50.223 --> 11:52.498
Never ever again.

11:56.061 --> 11:57.892
How could you?

11:58.439 --> 12:00.475
After all we've been through.

12:01.650 --> 12:04.926
What we had together
was real and special,

12:05.237 --> 12:08.195
and now you've cheapened it
for all eternity

12:08.490 --> 12:11.766
by broadcasting to the entire
Boston metropolitan area

12:12.077 --> 12:17.549
that I was nothing but
an odalisque in your seraglio.

12:20.960 --> 12:23.997
If that's your idea of the silent
treatment, it needs a little work.

12:25.715 --> 12:28.354
Oh, come on...
All right, all right,

12:28.675 --> 12:32.987
whatever it is I said, and whatever
the hell it was that you just said,

12:33.347 --> 12:36.896
what if--? What if I go back
on the air there and apologize?

12:37.226 --> 12:39.137
Will that fix things up?

12:40.980 --> 12:44.336
Do whatever you want.
I couldn't care less.

12:45.150 --> 12:46.629
Keep it short and simple.

12:49.029 --> 12:50.348
Something dignified.

12:50.655 --> 12:53.215
No sweat.

12:53.825 --> 12:56.100
I'll write the script for you.

12:56.369 --> 12:58.200
Well, is there anything else
you can tell me?

12:58.454 --> 13:01.252
No. No, I think that's just
about everything.

13:01.540 --> 13:02.814
When can you start?

13:03.042 --> 13:06.000
Look, you both seem like nice people,
huh? Do yourselves a favour.

13:06.295 --> 13:08.286
Don't hire me.

13:09.048 --> 13:11.357
Well, that's an interesting sales pitch
you have there,

13:11.633 --> 13:13.988
- but we're quite serious about this.
- And you don't know

13:14.262 --> 13:16.617
what you're letting yourselves
in for here. A lot of pain,

13:16.889 --> 13:18.527
a lot of heartache, a lot of misery.

13:18.766 --> 13:20.882
And that's just when you see the bill.

13:21.142 --> 13:23.610
My cousin, she's a pistol.

13:23.895 --> 13:27.683
Mr Carbone, by hiring you, we hope
to prove our spouses innocent.

13:28.024 --> 13:30.094
- Yeah, there you go.
- Well, in most of these cases

13:30.360 --> 13:33.432
the news is otherwise.
Believe me, I've seen it a million times.

13:33.738 --> 13:37.447
A bored husband, fed up with leftovers
in the bedroom as well as the kitchen,

13:37.784 --> 13:40.856
starts eyeing the cute little pastry tart
next door who's only too happy

13:41.162 --> 13:43.198
to serve up a little dessert.

13:43.915 --> 13:46.509
That's not true in our case,
is it, Norm?

13:47.418 --> 13:50.649
No. No way. Anyone else hungry?

13:52.590 --> 13:55.980
Look, nothing like this
has ever happened before.

13:56.301 --> 13:58.690
Up until now, we've both
had happy marriages.

13:58.971 --> 14:03.283
Please, believe me,
people who don't know are better off.

14:05.518 --> 14:08.510
- Could you excuse us for a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

14:10.148 --> 14:11.900
Well, Norm, what do you think?

14:12.150 --> 14:14.380
I'm not so sure we should
hire this guy.

14:14.652 --> 14:17.246
Well, if we're being made fools of,
I'd prefer to know it.

14:17.530 --> 14:20.602
Can't we just assume it
and save a little money here?

14:25.079 --> 14:27.115
All right, look, Mr Carbone,

14:27.373 --> 14:29.091
we're gonna hire your services,
all right?

14:29.333 --> 14:30.607
Your funeral.

14:31.877 --> 14:34.266
- Thanks for the referral, Carla.
- Yeah, see you, Santo.

14:34.547 --> 14:35.900
Yeah.

14:41.595 --> 14:46.464
- You're Diane Chambers, aren't you?
- Yes, I am. You look familiar.

14:46.850 --> 14:50.047
Weren't you an attendant
at Goldenbrook?

14:50.353 --> 14:51.627
That was just my cover.

14:51.979 --> 14:56.814
Santo was the one who I hired to track
you down at the insane asylum.

14:58.027 --> 15:00.746
It wasn't an insane asylum, damn it!

15:01.031 --> 15:04.990
It was more like a spa.

15:06.285 --> 15:08.560
You're out already, huh?

15:10.039 --> 15:12.792
Of course I'm out.

15:13.083 --> 15:15.802
- Why wouldn't I be out?
- No reason.

15:16.087 --> 15:18.840
Look, you take it easy.

15:26.597 --> 15:29.634
Okay, Sam Malone is back on
the show with a prepared statement

15:29.933 --> 15:32.163
that he's gonna read.
Go ahead, Sammy.

15:32.436 --> 15:37.874
Ladies and gentlemen, a week
ago on this program, l, Sam Malone,

15:38.274 --> 15:43.553
committed a faux pas
of the highest magnitude.

15:43.947 --> 15:47.781
I insensitively included
a wonderful woman in a category

15:48.117 --> 15:52.429
in which she certainly
did not merit inclusion.

15:53.121 --> 15:56.716
I apologize to her and indeed
to women everywhere,

15:57.042 --> 15:58.395
both living and dead,

15:59.378 --> 16:02.688
whose sensibilities
may have been offended.

16:03.006 --> 16:04.997
Yeah, yeah, well, whatever
peels your potatoes, Sam.

16:05.259 --> 16:07.056
Our next guest is a guy that played--

16:07.302 --> 16:10.260
- Very well done. Thank you, Sam.
- Yeah?

16:10.555 --> 16:13.627
You're welcome, little love bunny.

16:16.770 --> 16:17.759
Oy vey.

16:17.979 --> 16:20.413
You all right, Mr Peterson?
You've been awful quiet tonight.

16:21.190 --> 16:24.341
I was thinking about a high school
football game, actually.

16:24.652 --> 16:29.442
That was a long time ago, Woody.
And far away from here.

16:29.824 --> 16:32.896
We were playing our archrivals
for the state championship, you know?

16:33.202 --> 16:37.673
And I saw the cutest little cheerleader
that I've ever seen in my life

16:38.040 --> 16:40.076
just cheering her heart out.

16:40.625 --> 16:44.664
Yeah. I looked at her,
and the sun seemed to be shining

16:45.005 --> 16:47.599
only where she stood.
You know what I mean?

16:48.133 --> 16:53.161
And she seemed to be everything
that was bright and pure and good.

16:54.181 --> 16:58.572
I knew right then and there that l
wanted to make that little gal my wife.

16:58.976 --> 17:00.932
So I turned to Vera, and I said,

17:01.187 --> 17:04.065
"Honey, would you mind introducing
me to that cheerleader?"

17:06.150 --> 17:07.902
I'm joking, Woody.

17:08.236 --> 17:11.353
Of course that little cheerleader
was Vera.

17:11.655 --> 17:14.044
Hey, can I ask you a question,
Mr Peterson?

17:14.324 --> 17:16.679
- Sure, Woody.
- Who won the game?

17:19.663 --> 17:23.178
You know, I really couldn't tell you
who won, Woody,

17:23.500 --> 17:26.458
but tonight I sure know who lost.

17:28.087 --> 17:31.045
Well, can't you figure
it out from that?

17:36.304 --> 17:39.137
- Could I have another beer, please?
- Yeah. Coming up.

17:45.146 --> 17:48.934
Norm. Hi, I just got a call
from Mr Carbone.

17:49.275 --> 17:51.550
He's gonna drop by with his report
in a few minutes.

17:51.818 --> 17:53.888
- Did he say anything?
- No, he said he wanted to wait

17:54.154 --> 17:55.143
and talk to us in person.

17:55.531 --> 17:56.520
Oh, man.

17:58.534 --> 18:00.604
Could we wait in the backroom,
where it's private?

18:00.869 --> 18:03.064
All right. Sure.

18:13.048 --> 18:17.963
- Oh, Norm, where did we go wrong?
- I don't know.

18:18.344 --> 18:20.778
I've been racking my brain
trying to figure it out.

18:21.264 --> 18:24.017
I mean, day after day, night after night,
I sit on that stool out there

18:24.308 --> 18:27.141
wondering, "Why did she
lose interest in me?"

18:30.481 --> 18:32.551
Norm, listen.

18:32.816 --> 18:35.125
Whatever the outcome,
I want you to know

18:35.402 --> 18:37.632
I couldn't have gotten through this
without you.

18:37.904 --> 18:39.303
You've been a tower of strength.

18:39.907 --> 18:43.741
You've been great too, Phyllis.
Thank you.

18:45.496 --> 18:48.966
What if the news is bad?
I mean, what then?

18:49.665 --> 18:51.576
- Well, I know what I'm gonna do.
- Oh, yeah?

18:51.835 --> 18:55.430
I'm gonna go right out and have
an affair myself. Maybe lots of them.

18:55.755 --> 19:00.385
You are darn right.
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

19:01.010 --> 19:03.160
Just watch my dust.

19:06.766 --> 19:08.916
Of course,

19:09.185 --> 19:13.303
the difficult part
is finding the right person.

19:13.897 --> 19:16.013
It's hard, all right.

19:17.234 --> 19:21.386
Now, that's always the hard part.

19:21.738 --> 19:24.206
You know, it would have to be
someone who really understands me.

19:24.491 --> 19:26.402
You know what I mean?

19:26.659 --> 19:29.332
Someone you could depend on?

19:29.621 --> 19:32.499
But who? I wouldn't know
where to begin.

19:32.790 --> 19:35.384
I'd be completely lost.

19:52.434 --> 19:55.426
Of course, I wouldn't wanna
break up a marriage

19:55.729 --> 19:59.722
like those two home wreckers.

20:00.066 --> 20:02.182
Those jackals.

20:04.821 --> 20:06.971
Adulterers.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.470
Fornicators.

20:15.206 --> 20:18.994
All right-- Oh, for God's sakes!

20:20.420 --> 20:24.049
Boy, this is one for the books.
God help us all.

20:24.382 --> 20:26.452
All right.
Just-- No commentary, please.

20:26.717 --> 20:28.355
Skip it and just give us
the report here.

20:28.594 --> 20:31.392
All right, all right. I followed them
everywhere. From the supermarket

20:31.680 --> 20:33.989
to the movie theatre to the golf course.

20:34.266 --> 20:38.054
Last night I got what I wanted
at the Sea Shanty restaurant.

20:38.395 --> 20:40.465
- Well, let's hear the tape.
- Yeah, let's.

20:40.730 --> 20:43.642
I don't wanna hang around
here any longer than I gotta.

20:44.317 --> 20:46.877
- We've put this off too long.
- Well, we wanted to be sure

20:47.153 --> 20:49.189
- about some things.
- Right, l--

20:50.239 --> 20:52.116
- Busboy dropped a tray.
- What did she say?

20:52.367 --> 20:54.244
- I couldn't hear a thing.
- What did you say?

20:54.494 --> 20:58.851
I said I can't go through with it.
I just can't hurt Norm.

20:59.331 --> 21:03.324
I feel exactly the same way.
I can't hurt Norm either.

21:05.504 --> 21:07.699
- Well, I guess that's that.
- Yeah, I just realized

21:07.965 --> 21:10.240
in a strange kind of way
that I still love him.

21:10.509 --> 21:12.465
With all his faults.
He's never home.

21:12.720 --> 21:15.473
And so he hangs out
in some bar downtown.

21:15.764 --> 21:20.440
As far as our sex life goes,
he's not exactly Don Juan.

21:20.810 --> 21:22.562
It's more like Don of the Dead.

21:22.813 --> 21:25.373
I think we get the gist here.

21:28.067 --> 21:30.342
So nothing went on.

21:30.612 --> 21:33.524
Nothing. Vera and Ron happen
to be two of the sweetest people

21:33.823 --> 21:36.291
I ever ran across. They actually
changed my mind

21:36.576 --> 21:37.929
about this filthy business.

21:38.160 --> 21:40.833
Then I walk in here,
and I'm right back in the sewer.

21:42.790 --> 21:44.940
Well, you'll pardon me
if I go home now, won't you?

21:45.209 --> 21:49.043
I mean, suddenly
I feel like a shower.

21:50.005 --> 21:52.883
Hey-- You know--

21:53.175 --> 21:55.006
I'm gonna miss him.

21:57.513 --> 21:59.265
I...

21:59.514 --> 22:01.789
Well...

22:02.059 --> 22:05.847
...that's good news then, right, Norm?

22:06.188 --> 22:07.587
Yeah, I guess so.

22:07.981 --> 22:12.099
So I guess we don't have to go out and
find somebody to have an affair with.

22:12.443 --> 22:14.115
Guess not.

22:16.323 --> 22:18.041
Norm, can I ask you something?

22:18.282 --> 22:19.681
Yeah.

22:20.660 --> 22:24.494
When we kissed before,
did anything happen?

22:24.830 --> 22:27.139
Of course something happened.
Why would you ask that?

22:27.416 --> 22:29.452
You don't believe what Vera said
about our sex life?

22:29.710 --> 22:31.587
- No, no, not at all.
- Okay. Fine.

22:35.090 --> 22:38.241
It's just that, well, you know,

22:38.552 --> 22:41.385
just because Ron and Vera
didn't do anything

22:41.680 --> 22:43.796
doesn't mean that we have to...

22:45.434 --> 22:47.072
Well, what I'm trying to say is,

22:47.310 --> 22:50.143
is that when we kissed
something happened to me.

22:50.438 --> 22:54.033
When I heard that tape, Phyllis,
something happened to me.

22:54.358 --> 22:56.792
I realized how much Vera
means to me.

22:58.655 --> 23:01.647
Well, then, why don't you just run
on home to your precious little wife?

23:02.491 --> 23:05.688
All right, I'm gonna.
I'm gonna do just that.

23:06.662 --> 23:08.971
Right after a couple more beers.

23:15.087 --> 23:18.159
- I'm sorry, Norm.
- No, no, no.

23:18.465 --> 23:21.901
You know, in a strange kind of way,
I like Vera.

23:22.302 --> 23:25.021
Yeah, well, that's the only kind
of way you can.

23:25.763 --> 23:28.118
Oh, stop it.

23:29.184 --> 23:32.062
Yeah. I kind of like her too.

23:36.941 --> 23:40.251
- You know, she's a lucky woman.
- Come on.

23:41.445 --> 23:44.801
You are a definite hunk.

23:47.994 --> 23:49.268
Bye-bye.

23:56.960 --> 23:59.155
Norm Peterson...

23:59.963 --> 24:01.635
...hunk.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.358
- Hi there.
- Get lost.

24:05.740 --> 24:06.934
Right.
