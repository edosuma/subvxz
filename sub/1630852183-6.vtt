WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:08.718
[Odom Jr]

00:21.689 --> 00:23.399
want it to end...

00:23.441 --> 00:25.151
[Camille] Winter is here,

00:25.192 --> 00:27.778
and with its arrival
comes colder temps,

00:27.820 --> 00:30.823
oversized sweaters,
seasonal lattes,

00:30.823 --> 00:33.951
and most importantly,
cuffing season--

00:33.951 --> 00:36.078
the term we've coined
for that time of year

00:36.078 --> 00:38.998
when humans all over the world
find themselves

00:39.039 --> 00:42.626
desiring to be cuffed
or tied down to someone else.

00:42.626 --> 00:45.588
New term,
but not a new phenomenon.

00:45.588 --> 00:46.797
Throughout history,

00:46.797 --> 00:48.466
physical coldness
has been proven

00:48.466 --> 00:50.092
to activate a need

00:50.092 --> 00:52.636
for psychological warmth
and security.

00:52.636 --> 00:54.472
The mere look or smell
of your partner

00:54.472 --> 00:56.474
will increase levels
of oxytocin--

00:56.515 --> 00:59.018
also called
the cuddle hormone.

00:59.059 --> 01:02.396
And you're filled with
feelings of mild euphoria.

01:02.438 --> 01:04.774
In fact,
evolutionarily speaking,

01:04.774 --> 01:07.651
the cuffing months
are the most fertile season

01:07.693 --> 01:09.278
with birth rates
at their highest

01:09.278 --> 01:12.072
nine months later
in August and September.

01:12.114 --> 01:15.117
So, if human beings
had a mating season,

01:15.159 --> 01:17.369
well, this would be it. Okay.

01:17.369 --> 01:19.997
I want everyone to listen
to the "Sex Hurts"

01:19.997 --> 01:22.374
interview with anthropologist
Helen Fisher

01:22.416 --> 01:26.170
and give me a three to five
page response by Thursday.

01:26.212 --> 01:28.464
Stay warm.

01:30.883 --> 01:32.760
[low background chatter]

01:34.345 --> 01:38.057
Dr. Parks, Dr. Pruitt
wants to see us in her office.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.725
- Us?
- Us.

01:39.767 --> 01:42.686
See?
She messaged me on Facebook.

01:42.728 --> 01:44.230
Dr. Pruitt has Facebook?

01:44.271 --> 01:46.524
Yeah, we send each
other funny cat videos.

01:46.565 --> 01:48.984
Oh, that's cool.

01:48.984 --> 01:50.277
I like cats. Ha.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.570
[Dr. Pruitt]
So thank you for coming.

01:51.612 --> 01:54.323
Of course. Oh, and Nora
showed me your message.

01:54.365 --> 01:56.909
And I'm also on Facebook
in case you wanted to,

01:56.909 --> 01:58.661
you know,
be friends or something.

01:59.370 --> 02:02.790
Yeah. So, Nora has
put together research

02:02.832 --> 02:04.291
on various forms of pottery

02:04.291 --> 02:06.544
found at
the Seneca Village site.

02:06.544 --> 02:09.797
It's dense, so feel free to ask
if anything is confusing.

02:09.839 --> 02:11.465
Well, you know,
it's not as dense

02:11.507 --> 02:13.342
as my thesis on Seneca village,

02:13.342 --> 02:15.511
so I...I think I'll be okay.

02:15.553 --> 02:17.763
All right.
I'd like the two of you

02:17.763 --> 02:19.223
to put together a presentation.

02:19.265 --> 02:21.433
Nora, I'd like you
to focus on connections

02:21.475 --> 02:23.727
to the local
indigenous techniques.

02:23.769 --> 02:26.188
And Camille, I thought
you could talk about

02:26.230 --> 02:29.567
possible connections
to West African traditions.

02:29.608 --> 02:31.402
'Cause I'm Native
and you're Black.

02:31.443 --> 02:33.404
That's brilliant, Dr. Pruitt.

02:33.445 --> 02:35.573
[light music]

02:35.573 --> 02:39.326
Okay. Yes. Which puts you
on the same page, yes?

02:39.326 --> 02:40.953
[Camille] Definitely.

02:45.291 --> 02:47.209
What evil, straight white man

02:47.209 --> 02:48.878
do we have to thank
for deciding

02:48.878 --> 02:51.589
that women need to
steam their vaginas?

02:51.589 --> 02:52.965
Gwyneth Paltrow.

02:53.007 --> 02:56.760
Goop sells personal v-pods
for $1,800 a pop.

02:56.802 --> 02:58.095
Oh, that sounds about white.

02:58.137 --> 02:59.388
- Mm.
[Quinn] I don't dunno.

02:59.430 --> 03:03.058
Maybe V steaming was a little
too intimate an activity.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.643
Given the fact that
the last time we hung out

03:04.685 --> 03:06.228
wasn't exactly pleasant.

03:06.270 --> 03:08.731
Quinn, I've been meaning
to apologize.

03:08.772 --> 03:09.815
I'm sorry too.

03:09.857 --> 03:10.941
[both] I love you.

03:10.941 --> 03:12.192
[both giggling]

03:12.234 --> 03:14.945
See? We have to sit
in the uncomfortable

03:14.945 --> 03:17.281
to get back to the comfortable.

03:17.281 --> 03:19.241
Plus, I needed to get
my vagina ready

03:19.241 --> 03:21.076
for "Big Nigga Season."

03:21.118 --> 03:22.745
Big nigga what?

03:22.786 --> 03:24.204
Girl, it's like
you don't live on Earth.

03:24.246 --> 03:26.290
Big Nigga Season
is when you find a guy

03:26.290 --> 03:28.334
with a little extra
for the winter.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.461
All my go-tos
are already taken.

03:30.502 --> 03:33.297
With rehearsals and nannying,
my ass is behind

03:33.297 --> 03:35.382
on locking down
some big nigga dick.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.972
- Hey, D?
- What up, Ange?

03:42.014 --> 03:43.766
Surprised I didn't hear
from you this year.

03:43.807 --> 03:45.100
You know, I was
out here hustling

03:45.100 --> 03:46.268
and lost track of the seasons,

03:46.268 --> 03:48.103
but I'm ready for you now.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.981
Babe, I'm cold.

03:51.023 --> 03:52.983
Oh, is this your sister?

03:53.025 --> 03:54.652
Cold sister?

03:54.693 --> 03:57.071
Cousin? Taskrabbit?

03:57.112 --> 03:59.615
Nice seeing you.
Stay warm out there, Ang.

03:59.615 --> 04:01.283
Yep. Stay warm.

04:01.325 --> 04:02.701
No, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

04:02.701 --> 04:03.994
You got any big nigga brothers?

04:04.036 --> 04:05.371
You know, I'm not gonna
survive the winter

04:05.412 --> 04:07.790
without the extra body warmth!

04:07.831 --> 04:10.626
I usually got a nice rotation
going on by now.

04:10.668 --> 04:12.586
[whispering]
Thank you, thank you.

04:12.586 --> 04:13.921
Sorry. Sorry.

04:17.091 --> 04:18.759
Thought you said
it was just us.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.260
I did as a ploy.

04:20.302 --> 04:22.721
You be too stubborn
for your own good sometimes.

04:25.391 --> 04:27.267
Let's cut the middle-school
bullshit.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.561
It's been two weeks.

04:29.561 --> 04:30.896
- Camille?
- Hmm.

04:31.647 --> 04:33.273
I'm sorry.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.275
I'm sorry that I agreed
to design Myra's dress

04:35.275 --> 04:37.152
without talking to you
about it first.

04:37.194 --> 04:39.697
I was just so excited
about getting a big opportunity

04:39.697 --> 04:41.115
that I just jumped at it.

04:41.156 --> 04:42.866
It just sucks
that you hid it from me.

04:42.908 --> 04:44.618
For a day? Sometimes you're not

04:44.618 --> 04:46.495
the easiest to talk to
when you're upset.

04:46.537 --> 04:48.831
That's fair. [sighs]

04:48.872 --> 04:51.834
Just felt like
Mira snatched my dream life.

04:51.834 --> 04:55.045
And I just...I would hate it
if she snatched my friends too.

04:55.087 --> 04:57.715
Absolutely not. Never.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.008
And I love you.

04:59.049 --> 05:01.343
- I love you too.
- Oh!

05:01.385 --> 05:03.470
Now titty bump and make up.

05:03.512 --> 05:04.930
Come on, now.

05:08.684 --> 05:10.811
- Mmm.
- [giggling]

05:10.853 --> 05:13.522
- I love you.
- I love you too.

05:16.066 --> 05:17.568
Quinn, you still got
your panties on?

05:17.609 --> 05:19.361
Girl, I don't know what other
coochy has been on this thing,

05:19.361 --> 05:20.988
and y'all know
I can't be naked in public.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.114
[laughter]

05:22.156 --> 05:25.034
- Stop, I'm serious!
[Angie] Oh, my God.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.578
See, girl?
I can't stay mad at you.

05:27.578 --> 05:29.955
And Ms. Forbes's interview
can't stay mad at Tye.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.332
Girl, I was expecting her
to trash your ass.

05:32.374 --> 05:34.251
But she wrote a glowing review.

05:34.293 --> 05:37.546
I owe her a solid for hooking
me up with that article.

05:37.546 --> 05:39.339
Is that solid your pussy?

05:39.381 --> 05:41.300
- Quinn!
[Tye] Oh, my God!

05:41.341 --> 05:43.260
Have you been
practicing saying pussy?

05:43.302 --> 05:44.928
I have. Thanks for noticing.

05:44.928 --> 05:46.180
[Angie] Y'all, hold up.

05:46.221 --> 05:48.140
What the fuck am I
doing here with y'all?

05:48.182 --> 05:50.476
Everybody made up.
Now I gotta get to rehearsal.

05:50.517 --> 05:54.188
[mellow hip-hop]

05:54.229 --> 05:55.606
Okay, guys.

05:55.606 --> 05:56.982
So we're starting from the top
of the "Sunken Place."

05:57.024 --> 05:59.193
Positions, please.

05:59.234 --> 06:00.819
And...

06:00.861 --> 06:03.614
[eerie piano melody]

07:41.253 --> 07:42.421
[loud clapping]

07:42.462 --> 07:44.923
[director] Yes. Beautiful.
That's lunch.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.217
[Eric] What do you mean
we're not going to lunch?

07:47.217 --> 07:48.844
- Why?
[Trent] I love your abs.

07:48.886 --> 07:51.805
But, Eric, you're built
like a summer situation.

07:51.847 --> 07:54.224
I need thick thighs
to keep me warm.

07:54.266 --> 07:55.893
So you were always
gonna dump me?

07:55.934 --> 07:58.270
[Trent] I'll text you in May.
- [Eric scoffs]

07:58.312 --> 08:00.522
She better hope I have
the same number.

08:00.522 --> 08:03.025
- And you brought the man?
- I had fun.

08:03.066 --> 08:06.612
Oh, I'm sorry. That was brutal.

08:06.653 --> 08:07.821
I should have seen it coming.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.865
Yeah, a little.
But if it helps,

08:09.865 --> 08:12.075
I slipped on
Big Nigga Season too.

08:12.075 --> 08:14.369
Wasn't it just
"Hot Girl Summer"?

08:14.411 --> 08:15.621
And then Breast Cancer
Awareness Month,

08:15.621 --> 08:16.955
and I was wearing
all that pink.

08:16.955 --> 08:18.665
Look, I gotta pick up
this kid I nanny

08:18.707 --> 08:20.042
and take her home,

08:20.042 --> 08:22.377
but then I'm in search
of a big nigga myself

08:22.377 --> 08:24.129
if you wanted
to join the mission.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.924
Well, we just broke up
one minute ago,

08:26.924 --> 08:29.134
which is more than enough time
to move on

08:29.134 --> 08:30.552
and my find my own bear
to hibernate with.

08:30.594 --> 08:32.888
- Let's go then.
- Okay. Let's go find them.

08:32.888 --> 08:34.890
[Eric] Lions and tigers
and bears, oh, my!

08:34.890 --> 08:36.308
Come on. Ha.

08:36.350 --> 08:39.353
[mellow R&B]

08:47.861 --> 08:48.946
Hey.

08:48.987 --> 08:50.530
Hey, Anna.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.159
- Thank you for coming.
- What's up?

08:54.201 --> 08:56.912
Must be important for you
to want to meet me in public.

08:56.954 --> 08:58.497
Okay. That's fair.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.916
I just wanted to tell you
that I read the article.

09:00.958 --> 09:04.169
Well, I'd hope so. And?

09:04.211 --> 09:07.714
And I didn't expect it
to be so... good.

09:07.756 --> 09:10.342
I can't tell if
that's an insult or...

09:10.384 --> 09:13.553
- It's a compliment.
- Okay.

09:13.595 --> 09:15.806
Well...

09:15.806 --> 09:17.557
I like a compliment.

09:18.767 --> 09:19.851
So...

09:19.851 --> 09:21.853
So, we good, right?

09:21.895 --> 09:24.648
I mean, I just don't like
the way we left things.

09:24.648 --> 09:27.401
We? You told me
that you liked me

09:27.442 --> 09:28.819
and then five seconds later,

09:28.860 --> 09:30.904
you broke up with me
in the middle of the street.

09:30.946 --> 09:32.447
And you called me a coward.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.533
That's only because we were
acting like a coward.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.827
Clearly, you can't
accept an apology.

09:36.868 --> 09:38.662
Where was the apology?

09:38.704 --> 09:40.414
Me calling you was the apology.

09:40.455 --> 09:41.957
- [scoffs]
- But look,

09:41.957 --> 09:43.709
I missed hanging out with you.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.961
I still want us to be cool.

09:46.003 --> 09:48.338
Are you kidding me? [laughs]

09:48.380 --> 09:50.549
You know what? Fuck you.

09:52.009 --> 09:53.844
I read this right
on that first night

09:53.844 --> 09:55.595
when I left
without giving you my number.

09:55.637 --> 09:57.014
So why don't we
go back to that?

09:57.014 --> 09:59.891
Delete me and I'll delete you.
Cool?

10:09.109 --> 10:10.319
- [door closes]
- Hi-hi.

10:10.319 --> 10:11.236
Mom.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.487
You remember Isabella?

10:12.487 --> 10:15.365
Of course.
How could I forget my mentor?

10:15.407 --> 10:17.659
- Hi, Quinn.
- She needs your help.

10:17.701 --> 10:19.244
Impossible.
She's going to be president.

10:19.286 --> 10:22.039
True, but I do need your help.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.624
As much as I like to believe
we're past women in politics

10:24.666 --> 10:26.585
having to worry
about their fashion choices,

10:26.626 --> 10:28.128
the internet says otherwise.

10:28.170 --> 10:29.880
Some troll said she looks like

10:29.880 --> 10:32.632
Ross Dress for Less
shit on old Navy.

10:32.674 --> 10:34.926
Oh, the internet is brutal.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.720
So today is make-over day.

10:36.762 --> 10:39.389
- Only if you have time.
- Oh, I assured her

10:39.389 --> 10:41.350
that I am your only
paying customer,

10:41.391 --> 10:42.559
so you will have time.

10:42.601 --> 10:44.227
Actually, that's not true.

10:44.227 --> 10:46.104
I am currently designing a...

10:46.146 --> 10:47.939
I know, I know, you're so busy.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.900
I have to fight through
the crowd to get in here.

10:49.941 --> 10:52.402
Listen, put together
some pieces,

10:52.444 --> 10:54.279
make her look good,
but not trashy.

10:54.321 --> 10:57.991
She's working-class,
so poor, but not sad.

10:58.033 --> 10:59.743
You're in good hands, Isabella.

10:59.785 --> 11:02.454
Okay. I'm off to the Botox doc.

11:02.496 --> 11:04.498
I hate when my disappointment
is visible.

11:04.498 --> 11:05.791
[Camille] Mom, please.

11:05.832 --> 11:08.126
I could literally bounce
a quarter off your forehead.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.212
If only you had
a quarter to bounce.

11:10.253 --> 11:11.880
Ciao!

11:11.880 --> 11:13.548
Ciao.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.343
She is something.

11:16.385 --> 11:18.804
Yeah, better word
than I would have chosen.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.555
Let's try on clothes.

11:20.597 --> 11:21.681
How does it look?

11:23.475 --> 11:24.518
- I like it!
- I feel that,

11:24.518 --> 11:25.352
but you
going for president, girl.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.728
- I like it!
- No.

11:26.770 --> 11:27.729
I might be the kind of

11:27.729 --> 11:29.606
- new kind of president.
- No!

11:29.606 --> 11:30.732
- No?
- No.

11:30.774 --> 11:33.568
It's not bad.
I mean, it's my design, so...

11:33.610 --> 11:35.904
- All right.
- Oh, a design for you!

11:35.904 --> 11:37.072
Look at you... oh!

11:37.114 --> 11:39.116
Pink is the new black, honey.

11:39.157 --> 11:39.908
Ooh, maybe not that pink.

11:39.950 --> 11:41.952
What about this?

11:41.993 --> 11:43.328
you can run around...

11:43.328 --> 11:44.996
Aah! Ha ha!

11:45.038 --> 11:48.208
Ah-ah-ah, you look good, good.

11:48.250 --> 11:49.334
This is it right here.

11:49.376 --> 11:52.212
You're about to be president
in this, okay?

11:52.254 --> 11:53.672
Okay!

11:53.672 --> 11:56.133
[singer]

11:56.174 --> 11:58.260
I don't think this is the spot.

11:58.260 --> 12:01.888
Big niggas don't need heavy
coats; they are heavy coats.

12:01.888 --> 12:04.808
Trust me, last year
I met Bingo here.

12:04.808 --> 12:06.101
Bingo?

12:06.101 --> 12:07.727
No thin man named Bingo.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.479
That's what I'm trying
to tell you, girl.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.273
We ate pot pies every night!

12:11.273 --> 12:13.150
Oh, I love when they got
a little grease in they beard.

12:13.150 --> 12:14.401
Mm-hmm.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.695
[man] You got anything bigger
than a 3XL?

12:16.695 --> 12:18.321
Ooh!

12:18.321 --> 12:19.823
Move, girl, move, move!

12:19.823 --> 12:20.907
[woman] Okay... ow!

12:20.907 --> 12:22.325
Hey, zaddy.

12:22.325 --> 12:23.493
Hey, thick.

12:23.535 --> 12:25.495
Uh... hi?

12:25.537 --> 12:26.997
You wanna leave
this store with me?

12:27.038 --> 12:28.790
We'll cuddle up
in a large blanket

12:28.790 --> 12:30.292
and eat some chicken pot pie

12:30.292 --> 12:32.878
on a hopefully plush couch
in your apartment?

12:32.919 --> 12:34.880
Or sip double syrup hot cocoa

12:34.921 --> 12:36.673
and stare
into each other's eyes.

12:36.715 --> 12:39.176
Wow.
You really do have nice eyes.

12:39.176 --> 12:42.679
Thanks. I was gonna say
your boobs are really great.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.264
Top-shelf titties.

12:44.306 --> 12:49.394
So, what's it gonna be?
Boobs or eyes?

12:49.436 --> 12:50.854
Neither. I have a boyfriend.

12:50.854 --> 12:52.022
[stamps] That's not fair.

12:52.063 --> 12:53.815
Uhh! How do you expect us
to find big niggas

12:53.815 --> 12:55.442
if y'all double-dip like this?

12:55.442 --> 12:56.693
Ain't our fault
you waited this late.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.403
It's like buying
a Christmas tree on the 24th!

12:58.403 --> 13:00.780
Get your plus-ass fantasies
away from me!

13:00.780 --> 13:02.991
Whatever!

13:03.033 --> 13:04.576
Now what?

13:04.576 --> 13:06.244
Ooh! We hit Shake Shack.

13:06.244 --> 13:08.580
Big niggas love to eat,
and they always got a combo.

13:08.580 --> 13:09.998
Then Best Buy.

13:09.998 --> 13:11.833
Those security guys at the
front are always jumbo plus.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.752
And we wave down
every UPS truck we see.

13:13.752 --> 13:15.587
Yes, girl. Come on. Let's go.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.424
Oh, my goodness.
If you do not stay still,

13:19.424 --> 13:21.635
you're gonna look like
a crime scene.

13:21.676 --> 13:23.595
I'm sorry. I'm ticklish.

13:23.637 --> 13:25.847
So tell me more
about this prom tonight.

13:25.847 --> 13:27.682
It's actually
another fundraiser.

13:27.724 --> 13:29.518
The theme is '90's hip-hop.

13:29.518 --> 13:31.186
Hmm. Fun...

13:31.228 --> 13:33.063
But somehow I cannot imagine

13:33.063 --> 13:35.190
my mom giving her
fundraising spiel

13:35.190 --> 13:36.733
to a '90's hip-hop crowd

13:36.733 --> 13:38.485
without insulting
their fashion.

13:38.527 --> 13:39.861
Oh, no, she is not at this one.

13:39.861 --> 13:42.864
This one's hosted by
the Urban Education Coalition.

13:42.906 --> 13:46.159
So, open bar, DJ, photo booth.

13:46.201 --> 13:48.662
And rumor is,
AOC might even stop by.

13:48.703 --> 13:51.581
Oh, AOC. That is awesome.

13:51.623 --> 13:54.501
Maybe you two could be
like a dynamic duo.

13:54.501 --> 13:57.379
AOC and I... what are
your initials?

13:57.379 --> 13:58.755
They're not good.

13:58.797 --> 14:01.675
Oh, come on, AOC and...

14:01.716 --> 14:03.051
Isabella Benitez-Santiago.

14:03.051 --> 14:05.053
Okay. So that's...

14:05.095 --> 14:07.347
- I-B-S.
- Oh!

14:07.389 --> 14:08.265
No, no, no, no,
but this is good.

14:08.265 --> 14:10.934
Cause you're like the shit
but the good kind.

14:10.976 --> 14:13.645
No, no. There's no good way
to spin that.

14:13.687 --> 14:18.900
And I can say that I made IBS
the shit-sation she is today.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.570
Let's not get that trending.
You have to come tonight.

14:21.570 --> 14:22.612
It'll be fun.

14:22.654 --> 14:25.115
That way, I can give you
credit in person

14:25.115 --> 14:26.741
for how fabulous I look.

14:26.741 --> 14:28.285
- Okay. Deal.
- Awesome.

14:28.285 --> 14:29.911
So put on your best prom look

14:29.953 --> 14:33.248
and feel free
to bring a prom date.

14:33.290 --> 14:35.500
Are you seeing someone?

14:35.500 --> 14:37.043
Boyfriend, girlfriend?

14:37.085 --> 14:38.753
Um, boyfriend.

14:38.795 --> 14:41.965
I mean, well, a friend
with boy parts

14:41.965 --> 14:43.925
that I've touched occasionally.

14:43.967 --> 14:47.512
Oh. Well, Whatever he is,
he's welcome.

14:47.512 --> 14:50.140
[mellow jazz]

14:53.893 --> 14:55.520
This is nice.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.730
[man clears throat]

14:56.771 --> 14:58.898
Yo, you gotta buy the couch,

14:58.898 --> 15:01.067
or you and your girlfriend
gotta boo up someplace else.

15:01.109 --> 15:03.194
- Oh, no, I'm not his girl...
- I actually wanna

15:03.194 --> 15:06.072
buy the couch
if my girlfriend approves.

15:06.114 --> 15:08.241
What do you think, sweetie?

15:08.283 --> 15:09.701
Maybe we should look around
a little bit more

15:09.701 --> 15:10.952
before fully committing.

15:10.994 --> 15:13.163
I only want the best
for my boo.

15:13.163 --> 15:15.790
Aw, thanks, crumb cake.

15:15.790 --> 15:18.084
Oh...muah!

15:18.126 --> 15:20.545
[kissing sounds]

15:20.545 --> 15:21.796
[laughing]

15:21.796 --> 15:23.256
He hates us.

15:23.298 --> 15:25.383
I hate us.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.218
Promise we will never talk
to each other like that.

15:27.218 --> 15:29.596
Oh, I promise, lamb chop.

15:29.596 --> 15:32.474
- Stop.
- [chuckling]

15:32.474 --> 15:33.933
Yo, how can
a furnished apartment

15:33.933 --> 15:35.560
not come with a couch,
you know?

15:35.560 --> 15:37.395
Especially for what I'm paying.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.105
Yeah, well, welcome to New York

15:39.105 --> 15:40.774
where you get
a little for a lot.

15:40.815 --> 15:42.817
- Yep.
- So, um...

15:42.817 --> 15:44.486
I'm going to
this thing tomorrow.

15:44.486 --> 15:47.364
It's kind of like
a restaurant soft opening.

15:47.364 --> 15:49.574
Well, it's not kind of,
I mean, it's exactly that.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.701
- What about this one?
- Mm...

15:51.743 --> 15:52.994
It has cup holders.

15:52.994 --> 15:55.413
And it's leather,
which means slippery.

15:55.413 --> 15:56.790
Yeah, that's true.

15:56.831 --> 15:59.501
You can never find
the right position on these.

15:59.501 --> 16:03.380
Sorry. Anyway, you were saying
something about an opening.

16:03.380 --> 16:04.923
Right, yeah.

16:04.923 --> 16:08.259
So, the restaurant...
it's, uh, Ian's restaurant.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.637
- Mm-hmm.
- As in, um, my ex, Ian.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.639
But it's gonna be like
a really small event.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.683
- Small is intimate.
- Yeah.

16:14.683 --> 16:16.601
This one looks
perfectly comfortable.

16:16.601 --> 16:19.396
Um, yeah.
But really hard to clean.

16:19.437 --> 16:21.398
One bag of hot Cheetos,
and it's destroyed.

16:21.439 --> 16:22.774
And then you got to get
that special stuff

16:22.774 --> 16:24.109
to get the orange
finger stains out,

16:24.150 --> 16:25.944
Been there.

16:25.944 --> 16:28.279
So, yeah, um...

16:28.279 --> 16:30.490
I was thinking I should
probably keep the air clear

16:30.490 --> 16:33.576
between Ian and I,
so I should make an appearance.

16:33.618 --> 16:34.703
Camille, I'm cool with you
going to your ex's thing.

16:34.703 --> 16:36.413
It's all good.

16:36.454 --> 16:38.915
I wasn't asking for permission.

16:38.915 --> 16:40.875
It was just, um...

16:40.875 --> 16:44.629
I was wondering if maybe
you wanted to come with me.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.132
Oh, well, in that case,
I would love to meet the man

16:47.132 --> 16:48.967
and let you go and thank him.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.844
[chuckles]

16:52.470 --> 16:54.723
- So what do you think?
- It's ugly.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.015
Okay. I'll buy the first one.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.643
- Yeah.
- My man.

16:58.643 --> 17:00.019
[Jameson] Wow.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.479
[Camille] Wow, this is...
[Jameson] Okay.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.022
[Camille]...a nice place!

17:03.022 --> 17:05.108
- Can I take your coat?
- Oh.

17:08.528 --> 17:11.197
I'll take yours too.

17:11.239 --> 17:12.657
This looks...

17:12.657 --> 17:14.159
[Jameson] Wow!
- Completely different.

17:14.159 --> 17:16.578
[Jameson] Very nice.
Look at this.

17:16.619 --> 17:18.163
You came.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.540
- Yeah, well, we came.
- Oh.

17:20.582 --> 17:22.041
So who's your friend?

17:22.041 --> 17:25.545
[Jameson] Uh...
- Jameson Royce, I'm honored.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.797
Mira. What brings you here?

17:27.797 --> 17:29.924
- Well, we...
- We...we came together.

17:29.966 --> 17:32.135
[Mira] Wow!
[Aunt Tammy] Camille's here,

17:32.177 --> 17:34.053
and she brought someone.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.931
Y'all so damn messy.

17:36.973 --> 17:40.268
Oh, wow, Jameson.
I am a huge fan.

17:40.310 --> 17:41.978
- You're a real-life superhero.
- Oh, stop.

17:41.978 --> 17:43.855
I was just telling you
about him.

17:43.897 --> 17:45.273
He's the guy from Twitter.

17:45.273 --> 17:47.066
He started the scholarship
program in Oakland.

17:47.108 --> 17:49.986
They've already sent
32 kids to university.

17:50.028 --> 17:51.863
33, as of this afternoon.

17:51.905 --> 17:54.574
- [awkward laugh]
- Someone did a deep dive.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.242
I'm somewhat of
an activist myself.

17:56.284 --> 17:57.952
- Really?
- Yes. I recently bought

17:57.952 --> 17:59.120
a metal straw.

17:59.162 --> 18:00.914
Actually, I wanted to know...

18:00.914 --> 18:03.541
So is it weird or good that
our dates are hitting it off?

18:03.541 --> 18:04.667
Definitely both.

18:04.709 --> 18:07.253
- Oh, so he is your date?
- Yes.

18:07.295 --> 18:08.463
It's your first date?

18:08.505 --> 18:10.131
- No.
- No?

18:10.131 --> 18:12.342
Sustainable black-eyed
pea foam.

18:12.342 --> 18:14.302
I'm sorry. Did you say foam?

18:14.344 --> 18:16.638
We're also offering
a red fife heritage wheat,

18:16.679 --> 18:18.014
which was dry-farmed,

18:18.014 --> 18:19.516
meaning its only source
of water was rainfall.

18:19.557 --> 18:22.143
You know this ain't nothing
but bougie-ass cornbread.

18:22.185 --> 18:23.853
Ha ha. Basically.

18:23.895 --> 18:26.189
[Aunt Tammy] Nephew,
I am not disappointed.

18:26.231 --> 18:29.526
As bad as I thought it was
gonna be, it's so much worse.

18:29.567 --> 18:31.402
See, I should taken a cue
from your parents

18:31.402 --> 18:32.904
and not even bothered
to show up.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.031
Yeah, well, they actually
got caught up down in Florida.

18:35.073 --> 18:37.075
So they're coming here next
week for a private tasting.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.410
Baby, whatever it takes
to help you sleep at night.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.120
Now, thanks for dinner,

18:41.120 --> 18:43.790
but I actually have
to go eat now, I'm starving.

18:43.832 --> 18:45.333
Camille,
always good to see you,

18:45.333 --> 18:47.252
and congrats on the upgrade.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.754
Thank you, Aunt Tammy.
Nice to see you.

18:49.754 --> 18:51.756
- Hmm.
- We gotta get him the foam.

18:51.756 --> 18:53.424
[Ian] Hmm. [Camille] The foam!

18:53.466 --> 18:55.093
He looks like the foam type.

18:55.093 --> 18:57.470
[singer]

19:06.604 --> 19:08.565
Yes! Oh, prom.

19:08.565 --> 19:11.150
- Prom, yeah, prom.
- We gotta do prom.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.653
[photographer] Say, Cheese!
[both] Cheese.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.991
Oh, my God.
This is so much fun.

19:17.991 --> 19:21.411
[gasps]
Look at how cute we are.

19:21.452 --> 19:24.539
You are definitely a lot
cuter than my actual prom date.

19:24.539 --> 19:25.373
Who'd you take?

19:25.373 --> 19:26.708
Shelly Flores.

19:26.708 --> 19:28.626
She's the only person
who would go out with me.

19:28.626 --> 19:32.505
- Uh-uh, I do not believe that.
- No, look, I was like 4' 6"

19:32.505 --> 19:34.048
until like summer
after graduation.

19:34.048 --> 19:35.466
Everybody called me inches.

19:35.466 --> 19:37.051
Whoa!

19:37.051 --> 19:38.636
And then like
on prom night like,

19:38.636 --> 19:40.305
your parents are like,
"Be careful.

19:40.305 --> 19:41.723
Don't have sex.

19:41.723 --> 19:43.349
- Mm-Hmm.
- Well, I didn't listen,

19:43.349 --> 19:45.101
and I had sex
for the first time,

19:45.101 --> 19:47.979
and then nine months later--
JJ.

19:47.979 --> 19:50.982
Oh wow.
You are a cautionary tale.

19:50.982 --> 19:53.234
Yeah.

19:53.234 --> 19:56.404
So...how are things
between you and Shelly now?

19:56.446 --> 19:58.573
You know, started off kind
of rocky, but we're cool now.

19:58.573 --> 20:00.116
Her husband's awesome,
that's my guy.

20:00.158 --> 20:01.451
So, you know, modern family.

20:01.451 --> 20:03.119
Hey! You made it.

20:03.119 --> 20:04.704
Hi!

20:04.704 --> 20:06.998
Oh, my gosh.
This is so much fun.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.791
Guys, Todd, over here.

20:08.833 --> 20:11.044
This is Quinn and...

20:11.085 --> 20:12.921
- Sean.
- Sean. Nice to meet you, Sean.

20:12.921 --> 20:14.714
This is Todd,
my campaign manager.

20:14.756 --> 20:17.091
I am forever grateful.

20:17.091 --> 20:19.177
Look at her,
dressing like a real human.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.679
- Oh, stop it.
- No, you have no idea.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.890
When she showed up last week
bringing the same pattern

20:23.890 --> 20:26.142
as the wallpaper
in an elderly woman's home,

20:26.184 --> 20:28.603
I knew we needed
an intervention.

20:28.645 --> 20:30.480
You must know how much
we love your mother.

20:30.521 --> 20:32.857
- She's been so generous.
- Like a second mom.

20:32.899 --> 20:36.152
We are seeing her tomorrow
for another fundraiser.

20:36.194 --> 20:37.612
Mmm, fun.

20:37.654 --> 20:39.864
So do you all work
on the campaign?

20:39.906 --> 20:41.950
I do. But the group's kind
of all across the board.

20:41.950 --> 20:43.701
Went to Cornell together.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.787
And what about you?
What's your deal?

20:45.828 --> 20:48.373
- Uh, my deal?
- Yeah, like what do you do?

20:48.414 --> 20:49.791
I'm a dancer.

20:49.791 --> 20:52.293
- For Alvin Ailey.
- Oh, nice!

20:52.335 --> 20:53.878
- That's exciting.
- Mm-hmm, yeah it is,

20:53.920 --> 20:55.797
if it ever comes up
with my mom.

20:55.838 --> 20:57.215
So when's your next show?

20:57.256 --> 20:58.800
- It's...
- We will let know.

20:58.841 --> 21:00.593
How did you two meet?

21:00.635 --> 21:03.096
At an NYU alumni event.

21:03.096 --> 21:05.431
And we have been inseparable
ever since.

21:05.431 --> 21:08.017
Oh, sweet. Married? Kids?

21:08.059 --> 21:09.435
- I have...
- No, no, no, no, no.

21:09.435 --> 21:11.688
It's just a little too early
for that, right, babe?

21:11.688 --> 21:13.272
Sure.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.483
Excuse me.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.238
I'll take a drink, babe.
Good idea.

21:20.363 --> 21:23.866
Oh, my gosh, men.
You mention one word of kids,

21:23.866 --> 21:25.702
and they just take off running.

21:25.702 --> 21:27.453
[laughter]

21:27.495 --> 21:29.497
[Todd] But seriously,
she looks amazing.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.377
Looks like we lost
our dates again, huh?

21:34.377 --> 21:36.379
Uh...they'll catch up.

21:36.379 --> 21:38.464
Mm-mm. I know that tone.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.341
Somebody needs carbs.

21:40.341 --> 21:41.634
- [chuckles]
- Tshhh.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.845
How you been?
You seem a little, uh,

21:43.845 --> 21:45.430
- off.
- No.

21:45.471 --> 21:47.974
No, it's just...work.

21:47.974 --> 21:50.476
And plus I have to keep
blowing off therapy, so...

21:50.476 --> 21:52.353
Oh my gosh,
is that shrimp and grits?

21:52.353 --> 21:53.855
Why you skipping therapy?

21:53.896 --> 21:56.899
Can we not?
Let's just focus on the food.

21:56.941 --> 21:59.610
All right. I'm calling
this one, the Yvonne.

21:59.652 --> 22:02.947
- After my middle name?
- No, coincidence.

22:04.699 --> 22:06.951
Here. Taste it.

22:06.951 --> 22:08.077
[ahem]

22:08.077 --> 22:09.287
Mmm...

22:11.039 --> 22:12.623
Bon appetite.

22:14.751 --> 22:17.336
Oh. That's so good.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.880
Mm-Hmm.

22:18.921 --> 22:21.340
[exhales]
Hopefully, we give it a chance.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.176
And it doesn't help
that you start

22:23.176 --> 22:24.427
a whole damn
movement against me.

22:24.469 --> 22:26.345
Well, maybe the backlash
will die down

22:26.345 --> 22:27.972
if you do a few things
to decolonize this place.

22:28.014 --> 22:30.141
Yeah? Like what?

22:30.141 --> 22:32.852
Well, for starters,
you could mix in some black art

22:32.852 --> 22:33.853
from the locals,

22:33.853 --> 22:35.646
some photographs
of the neighborhood.

22:35.646 --> 22:37.732
Just some things to give it
some history,

22:37.774 --> 22:39.901
- some authenticity.
- So basically you hate it.

22:39.942 --> 22:42.195
Well, I like the floors.

22:42.195 --> 22:43.237
All right.

22:43.279 --> 22:46.157
How about you help me
make some changes.

22:46.199 --> 22:48.910
Clearly,
I don't know much about art.

22:48.951 --> 22:50.661
Uh, I don't know.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.413
Come on, I can
throw you some money.

22:52.413 --> 22:56.042
Oh, okay. You throwin',
then I'm gonna catch.

22:56.084 --> 22:56.751
Yeah. Money talks.

22:56.751 --> 22:58.669
There you are.

22:58.669 --> 23:01.422
Ah, let me introduce you
to the money man.

23:01.422 --> 23:05.384
Louis, let me introduce you
to Dr. Camille Parks.

23:05.384 --> 23:08.721
- Nice to meet you.
- Beautiful.

23:08.721 --> 23:11.307
Oh, oh, my. Oh, okay.

23:11.307 --> 23:13.017
[Camille and Ian laughing]

23:13.017 --> 23:14.852
Hey.

23:16.604 --> 23:18.564
Just like Josephine.

23:18.606 --> 23:20.233
Baker?

23:20.274 --> 23:22.652
Louie, Dr. Parks has agreed
to come on board,

23:22.652 --> 23:23.903
help us make this place

23:23.903 --> 23:25.363
a little more welcoming
for the community.

23:25.404 --> 23:26.989
What do you think?

23:27.031 --> 23:29.534
Anything for Josephine.

23:29.534 --> 23:30.993
[Camille] Oh...
- All right.

23:30.993 --> 23:34.413
- Watch that fire.
- All right.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.623
Shawn, where are you going?

23:35.623 --> 23:36.707
Work. I'm going early.

23:36.749 --> 23:39.502
- What? Why are you... why?
- Cut it out.

23:39.544 --> 23:40.878
I know what it's like
to go out with someone

23:40.878 --> 23:42.046
who's embarrassed by me.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.549
No, I'm not. It's not...

23:44.590 --> 23:46.259
Just they...

23:47.510 --> 23:49.095
They know my mom.

23:49.137 --> 23:50.513
I didn't expect you
to introduce me

23:50.513 --> 23:52.598
as your stripper boyfriend.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.684
But you made up
a whole new person.

23:54.684 --> 23:57.311
I don't have a kid,
I dance for Alvin Ailey.

23:57.311 --> 23:58.729
I don't even know who that is.

23:58.771 --> 24:02.066
if that's the guy that you
want, you need to go get him.

24:02.066 --> 24:03.693
Shawn, no,
I didn't mean it like that.

24:03.734 --> 24:05.444
I was just...

24:05.444 --> 24:06.445
Shawn.

24:08.489 --> 24:10.366
Shawn!

24:10.408 --> 24:13.161
[muffled dance music]

24:15.621 --> 24:17.540
[applause]

24:18.916 --> 24:20.877
So that big nigga hunt
was a huge fail.

24:20.877 --> 24:22.753
- Oh, pun intended.
- Ha ha.

24:22.753 --> 24:23.921
It's gonna be cold this winter.

24:23.921 --> 24:26.549
All righty, next up,
we have Angie and Eric.

24:26.549 --> 24:28.092
- Ooh!
- What? Oh.

24:28.092 --> 24:29.802
Oh, shit.
Okay, come on, come on, girl.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.179
Straight up. Let's go.

24:31.179 --> 24:33.598
Y'all, come see
"Get Out," the musical.

24:33.598 --> 24:35.641
We're in "Get Out,"
so make sure y'all come see it

24:35.641 --> 24:37.268
[overlapping chatter]

24:37.310 --> 24:39.645
[Angie] Thank you.
- And me, Bo.

24:39.645 --> 24:41.898
- Thank you.
[Angie] Yes!

24:41.898 --> 24:43.649
All right, y'all, thank
y'all for coming out tonight.

24:43.649 --> 24:45.234
It's been great.
Enjoy this song,

24:45.234 --> 24:46.986
'cause it's gonna be
shut down after this.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.529
- Okay.
- Hit it.

24:48.529 --> 24:50.156
In advance, you are welcome.

24:50.156 --> 24:51.991
All right, you start.

25:03.544 --> 25:05.546
[Eric]

25:08.216 --> 25:10.259
[Angie]

25:11.802 --> 25:13.512
[Eric]

25:16.390 --> 25:18.392
[Angie]

25:18.392 --> 25:21.979
Oh, you're still here.
So, no hot date tonight?

25:22.021 --> 25:23.856
I have a ton of financials
to get through.

25:23.856 --> 25:25.274
What do you want?

25:25.316 --> 25:27.818
I just got your travel
itinerary from Afro Tech.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.320
Put it over there.

25:29.362 --> 25:30.905
[hisses] Ah!

25:30.947 --> 25:32.240
Are you okay?

25:32.281 --> 25:33.407
I'm fine...

25:33.449 --> 25:34.617
ish.

25:34.659 --> 25:38.371
Get me an aspirin.
Thank you, thank you.

25:41.582 --> 25:45.962
[Eric]

25:48.673 --> 25:49.924
Can we talk?

25:49.966 --> 25:51.634
I'm working.

25:51.634 --> 25:53.719
I know how little
you think of it, but still...

25:59.267 --> 26:01.644
- What are you doing?
- I thought it was obvious.

26:01.686 --> 26:04.021
I stopped making out
with gay men in college.

26:04.021 --> 26:06.232
Mainly 'cause they asked me to.

26:06.274 --> 26:07.817
Gay? No, I'm Bi.

26:07.858 --> 26:09.068
What?

26:09.110 --> 26:10.861
Look...

26:10.903 --> 26:13.906
I don't think
I'm better than you, see?

26:18.911 --> 26:20.162
Whoo!

26:20.204 --> 26:22.707
- I'm a pro!
- Okay, Quinn,

26:22.748 --> 26:25.251
you can get down now.
What do you want?

26:25.293 --> 26:26.711
- Honesty.
- You were the one

26:26.752 --> 26:27.628
who lied about who I was.

26:27.628 --> 26:30.214
I know. And it was shitty.

26:30.256 --> 26:32.216
I also lied to you about
who I was.

26:32.258 --> 26:34.010
The night we met,
I was trying to be somebody

26:34.010 --> 26:35.344
who wasn't looking for love

26:35.344 --> 26:37.722
and who was just looking
for sex, but that isn't me.

26:37.763 --> 26:39.181
I'm also not someone
who's ever gonna

26:39.181 --> 26:40.933
make anyone feel bad
about who they are

26:40.933 --> 26:42.184
or what they do.

26:42.226 --> 26:44.770
That's what my mom does to me,
and I did it to you.

26:44.812 --> 26:47.189
It's gross, I'm sorry.

26:47.231 --> 26:49.942
Truth is, you're the first
person I've met in a long time

26:49.984 --> 26:52.903
that... I can actually
breathe around.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.656
I don't wanna lose that.

26:55.698 --> 26:57.366
You been bisexual
this whole time?

26:57.366 --> 26:59.160
Longer.
Ever since I couldn't decide

26:59.160 --> 27:01.370
between Whitley or Dwayne Wayne
on "A Different World."

27:01.412 --> 27:04.081
Wow. So you really
do like my titties.

27:04.123 --> 27:05.249
Mm-Hmm.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.168
So, now that you know,

27:07.209 --> 27:08.294
you wanna
make a summer situation work

27:08.294 --> 27:10.296
for the winter or what?

27:11.630 --> 27:14.050
We could always buy blankets.

27:14.091 --> 27:16.344
- Mmm, I know that's right.
- Mm-Hmm.

27:23.476 --> 27:24.685
Whoa! Hey!

27:24.685 --> 27:26.520
[both] We ain't done yet!

27:36.155 --> 27:37.615
[Eric]

27:40.117 --> 27:43.746
[both]

27:45.873 --> 27:48.000
[Eric]

27:48.042 --> 27:51.712
[both]

27:51.712 --> 27:53.172
Why?
Why is he giving her a rose?

27:53.172 --> 27:54.673
He doesn't even like her.

27:54.673 --> 27:57.051
Nobody likes her. Jeez.

27:57.051 --> 27:59.220
That's terrible.

27:59.929 --> 28:01.889
I, um...

28:01.889 --> 28:03.557
had something
I wanted to ask you.

28:03.557 --> 28:04.809
Uh-oh.

28:04.809 --> 28:07.269
And look, you can feel free
to reject me.

28:07.311 --> 28:08.938
Double Uh-oh.

28:08.938 --> 28:11.440
But when we were looking
at couches the other day,

28:11.482 --> 28:13.901
I really did not mind
the sound of girlfriend.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.989
I didn't mind it either.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.574
Kinda liked it.

28:20.616 --> 28:22.284
So...

28:24.495 --> 28:26.414
But you're leaving
in a few months.

28:26.414 --> 28:28.457
Yeah, but come on.
Plans can change.

28:28.499 --> 28:29.917
And they have planes.

28:29.959 --> 28:33.712
Okay. Yes...

28:33.712 --> 28:34.797
boyfriend.

28:34.797 --> 28:36.715
Yes, girlfriend.

28:44.932 --> 28:46.892
[phone chimes]

28:49.603 --> 28:53.941
[mellow R&B]

28:57.236 --> 28:59.780
Okay. Okay. Okay!

28:59.822 --> 29:01.907
Angie is the first one here.

29:01.949 --> 29:05.035
Now, tell me, how in the hell
did that happen?

29:05.035 --> 29:07.204
Fuck if I know. But a quick PS.

29:07.204 --> 29:08.956
It will be the last time.

29:08.956 --> 29:11.041
Turns out
I am not a fan of waiting.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.252
Girl, a solid half
of our brunches

29:13.252 --> 29:16.213
have turned into dinners
because of yo late ass.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.007
- [laughing]
- Aah...

29:18.007 --> 29:19.925
Fuck, my back.

29:19.967 --> 29:22.094
It's my period.

29:22.094 --> 29:25.890
Lucky enough to be a woman.
Just the price of admission.

29:25.890 --> 29:28.225
Girl, you need to go
to a doctor.

29:28.225 --> 29:30.269
Uh-uh. I'm stronger than that.

29:30.311 --> 29:31.854
Fuck that.
I don't have insurance,

29:31.854 --> 29:33.397
and I still get
my shit checked out.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.191
Planned Parenthood
has a sliding scale,

29:35.232 --> 29:38.194
and I slid right on down
to free.

29:38.194 --> 29:40.571
Oh shit, she brought the boo.

29:40.571 --> 29:43.532
Ladies, this is Jameson.

29:43.574 --> 29:45.493
- In the flesh.
- Uh-huh.

29:45.534 --> 29:46.994
I told him that I was gonna
meet you guys here

29:46.994 --> 29:49.663
and he hadn't met you yet,
so... where's Quinn?

29:49.705 --> 29:50.706
Oh, she got stuck in the store.

29:50.706 --> 29:52.416
She texted. She's on her way.

29:52.458 --> 29:54.543
It was great to meet
two-thirds of the group.

29:54.585 --> 29:56.670
[Tye] Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, player.

29:56.712 --> 29:59.089
Don't get comfortable.
You can't just stick it in.

29:59.131 --> 30:00.341
- Mm-mm.
- Okay, Tye,

30:00.382 --> 30:01.926
please don't do this.

30:01.967 --> 30:03.594
No one sits until they vetted.

30:03.636 --> 30:05.346
And when Quinn comes,

30:05.387 --> 30:07.097
she's gonna do this
all over again.

30:07.139 --> 30:08.724
And she will include
an essay question,

30:08.724 --> 30:10.059
so get ready for that.

30:10.100 --> 30:11.185
Okay.

30:11.185 --> 30:12.895
So, what is
the vetting process?

30:12.937 --> 30:15.356
For starters, drop your pants.

30:15.397 --> 30:17.900
She's kidding.
That was a dumb joke.

30:17.942 --> 30:21.320
Real question. Go-to album.

30:21.362 --> 30:22.696
I'm old-school,

30:22.696 --> 30:23.614
So give me
Marvin Gaye's anything.

30:23.656 --> 30:24.990
I fuck with that.

30:25.032 --> 30:26.784
You have your own place, right?

30:26.825 --> 30:29.119
- Of course.
- Your finances are in order.

30:29.161 --> 30:30.120
One hundred percent.

30:30.162 --> 30:32.206
You let her be the boss
in the bedroom?

30:32.248 --> 30:34.124
Each and every time.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.376
Ooh!

30:35.417 --> 30:37.920
Just kidding. You can sit.

30:37.962 --> 30:40.005
[Jameson] Oh...
- Oh, my gosh.

30:40.005 --> 30:43.509
- You all had me worried.
- Y'all are a damn mess.

30:43.509 --> 30:46.262
So, I hear this group watches
"Weather Wives."

30:46.303 --> 30:47.846
Are you a fan?

30:47.888 --> 30:50.266
Uh, am I a fan? Listen,
I was in Tampa for work

30:50.266 --> 30:51.934
and happened to be
right behind Fiona

30:51.934 --> 30:53.978
at the restaurant
when she told Yolanda,

30:54.019 --> 30:57.022
"Today's forecast is cloudy
with a chance of..."

30:57.064 --> 31:00.150
[all]
It's raining martinis, bitch!

31:00.192 --> 31:03.070
[laughter]

31:03.112 --> 31:05.948
I hate being late,
but I had fun tonight.

31:05.990 --> 31:07.866
I mean, how much
do we love Jameson?

31:07.908 --> 31:10.661
I mean, he definitely loosened
up by the time you got there.

31:10.703 --> 31:12.496
[chuckling] I liked him.

31:12.538 --> 31:16.542
Fuck! Fucking cramps.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.586
Maybe we should
go see the doctor.

31:18.586 --> 31:20.421
No, stop that.

31:20.462 --> 31:22.548
Tye, come on, please.

31:22.590 --> 31:25.926
Everything is fine. I'm fine.

31:25.968 --> 31:27.261
- Ohh...
- Tye!

31:27.261 --> 31:29.847
Oh, my God. Tye.
Someone, please call 911!

31:29.847 --> 31:30.973
Please!

31:31.015 --> 31:34.560
