WEBVTT

00:07.181 --> 00:08.834
Have you seen Blake?

00:08.878 --> 00:11.359
He's in an early meeting.
He should be back soon.

00:11.402 --> 00:14.362
Well, have you seen this?
The <i>Atlanta Mirror?</i>

00:14.405 --> 00:16.320
You'd think there'd be more
important news than the battle

00:16.364 --> 00:18.757
to reopen my grandfather's will.
What are you doing?

00:18.801 --> 00:21.804
Trikonasana. You should try it.
It relieves stress.

00:21.847 --> 00:23.719
No, I mean what are you doing
about the case?

00:23.762 --> 00:25.112
And can you
please stand up?

00:25.155 --> 00:26.809
It's hurting my neck
to talk to you like this.

00:30.334 --> 00:32.206
The only ammunition Ben has

00:32.249 --> 00:34.077
is a copy
of Thomas's outdated will

00:34.121 --> 00:35.818
in which Ben was named
a beneficiary.

00:35.861 --> 00:37.211
Yes. I know that.

00:37.254 --> 00:39.517
We all know that,
thanks to Amanda. What else?

00:39.561 --> 00:42.303
Blake is with his lawyers,
who are in the process

00:42.346 --> 00:44.653
of filing a motion to
dismiss the case right now,

00:44.696 --> 00:46.220
so you should try
not to worry.

00:46.263 --> 00:47.656
All I'm trying to do
is figure out

00:47.699 --> 00:50.093
why Blake isn't taking
a more aggressive approach.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.834
Letting the lawyers
handle it

00:51.877 --> 00:54.054
is what scared people do.
Or guilty people.

00:54.097 --> 00:55.316
What is wrong with him?

00:55.359 --> 00:56.665
It was my idea
to use the lawyers

00:56.708 --> 00:58.058
and not engage Ben directly.

00:58.101 --> 01:00.190
After my experience
with Beto,

01:00.234 --> 01:01.757
I know what it's like
to get wrapped up

01:01.800 --> 01:04.368
- with an angry brother.
- Exactly.

01:04.412 --> 01:06.979
Your genius approach with Beto
got you trapped in a basement

01:07.023 --> 01:08.981
and replaced with a clone.

01:14.335 --> 01:16.032
Be careful
with that wardrobe box.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.121
I can't have my husband
coming home from a work trip

01:18.165 --> 01:20.689
to find his
Brunello Cucinelli suits torn.

01:24.649 --> 01:26.608
Looks like you're knee-deep
in wedding presents.

01:26.651 --> 01:28.088
A wedding you crashed,

01:28.131 --> 01:30.394
- I seem to recall.
- That's what these are for.

01:30.438 --> 01:32.222
I'm sorry if I, uh,
stole your thunder

01:32.266 --> 01:34.137
- with my dramatic entrance.
- Don't worry.

01:34.181 --> 01:35.486
My children
had already done that.

01:35.530 --> 01:38.402
Besides, your arrival
pissed off Blake,

01:38.446 --> 01:39.882
so it wasn't all bad.

01:39.925 --> 01:42.058
Along those lines,
I could use your help.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.234
I figured there was
another reason for the flowers.

01:44.278 --> 01:45.148
Got a
plan in motion

01:45.192 --> 01:46.280
to win my court battle,

01:46.323 --> 01:47.803
but I'm looking
for some insurance.

01:47.846 --> 01:50.153
Well, I heard about that
from Fallon.

01:50.197 --> 01:52.938
How can I be of service
in the war of the will?

01:53.939 --> 01:55.811
Well, before our mother died,

01:55.854 --> 01:58.944
I know Blake tried to put her
in an assisted living facility.

01:58.988 --> 02:00.685
And I want to
show that it was

02:00.729 --> 02:02.861
not because he was concerned
- for her.
But rather

02:02.905 --> 02:06.169
because he couldn't be bothered
- to take care of her himself?
- Right.

02:06.213 --> 02:07.997
He's playing the dutiful son
in public,

02:08.040 --> 02:10.434
but any communication
between him and that facility

02:10.478 --> 02:12.001
would tell a different story.

02:12.044 --> 02:14.438
So, if you can make people
believe that Blake

02:14.482 --> 02:16.832
was the negligent one
in terms of your mother,

02:16.875 --> 02:19.878
that would raise
reasonable doubt that you were.

02:19.922 --> 02:21.358
Exactly. And in that case,

02:21.402 --> 02:23.708
Blake pressuring my father
to disinherit me

02:23.752 --> 02:26.320
would be illegal,
and that'll reopen the will.

02:26.363 --> 02:29.236
While I believe Blake deserves
everything coming to him,

02:29.279 --> 02:32.717
I have no access
to any of that anymore.

02:32.761 --> 02:35.111
Mm. Figured as much.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.504
It was worth a shot.

02:36.547 --> 02:38.201
However,

02:38.245 --> 02:41.204
I wish you luck,
and I will enjoy the show.

02:43.206 --> 02:45.643
Did you book the trio
- for next Jazz Night?
- Booked and confirmed.

02:45.687 --> 02:47.819
And you got
the extra cases of wine

02:47.863 --> 02:49.734
for the Breslin wedding
- this weekend?
- Check.

02:49.778 --> 02:52.215
Oh, and can you meet
with the new waitress I hired?

02:52.259 --> 02:54.609
No, restaurant personnel
is your thing.

02:54.652 --> 02:56.219
Yes, that's true.

02:56.263 --> 02:57.699
Except when I hire someone
I'd like you to meet

02:57.742 --> 02:59.744
because she would be perfect
for you.

02:59.788 --> 03:01.964
No more setups.
I thought I was clear.

03:02.007 --> 03:04.053
- We're not doing this anymore.
- You were clear.

03:04.096 --> 03:06.360
But I still feel guilty about
how things went down with Sasha

03:06.403 --> 03:09.232
when I kind of,
sort of broke you guys up.

03:09.276 --> 03:10.755
I want to make it up to you.

03:10.799 --> 03:12.366
That wasn't your fault.

03:12.409 --> 03:15.282
Anyway, you can make it up to me
by just hanging out.

03:15.325 --> 03:17.371
Let's go see that Chinese film

03:17.414 --> 03:19.808
playing at the independent
theater in Midtown tonight. <i>Hen hao.</i>

03:20.896 --> 03:22.332
As an international businessman,

03:22.376 --> 03:24.247
I speak a little bit
of a lot of languages.

03:24.291 --> 03:27.250
And that means "very good."
- I'm in.
- Perfect.

03:27.294 --> 03:28.686
Uh, one more thing.

03:29.687 --> 03:30.906
If you're not gonna date
the waitress,

03:30.949 --> 03:32.299
do you mind firing her?

03:32.342 --> 03:33.256
She's been getting
a lot of complaints

03:33.300 --> 03:34.823
in the last three days,

03:34.866 --> 03:36.520
and, uh, I was only
keeping her on for you.

03:36.564 --> 03:38.435
Hmm. Not happening.

03:38.479 --> 03:40.132
<i>Where is everyone?</i>

03:40.176 --> 03:42.265
And, more importantly,
where is breakfast?

03:42.309 --> 03:45.137
Blake told Mrs. Gunnerson
not to lay out a big spread

03:45.181 --> 03:47.444
because he went
to an early breakfast meeting,

03:47.488 --> 03:49.925
so apparently if Blake doesn't
need to eat, then none of us do.

03:49.968 --> 03:51.927
I wanted celebratory mimosas,

03:51.970 --> 03:54.321
but the celebration is missing
from my juice.

03:54.364 --> 03:56.975
And so is the audience.
Oh, yeah?

03:57.019 --> 03:58.890
Why? What are you celebrating?
Dom-Mystique

03:58.934 --> 04:00.892
was selected as a
Final Five Finalist

04:00.936 --> 04:04.418
for the NordicStar Airline
uniform design contest.

04:04.461 --> 04:07.203
I'll settle for your
- solo admiration.
- Hey.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.639
Congratulations.

04:08.683 --> 04:10.380
Well, that was a
little perfunctory.

04:13.470 --> 04:15.342
- Congratulations!
- Better.

04:15.385 --> 04:17.213
Actually, I just signed the
paperwork for my next book deal,

04:17.257 --> 04:20.608
so <i>you</i>
could be congratulating <i>me.</i>

04:21.609 --> 04:23.437
Congratulations!

04:23.480 --> 04:25.047
You're right,
that does feel good.

04:25.090 --> 04:27.179
Told you. So, what are you
planning to write about?

04:27.223 --> 04:29.312
Actually, I'm not sure.
You know, the good news is

04:29.356 --> 04:30.966
I have a ton of ideas. I just
don't know which one's right.

04:31.009 --> 04:33.838
I could help you choose.
I'm a very creative person.

04:33.882 --> 04:37.320
Did I mention
I made the Final Five?

04:37.364 --> 04:38.887
Yeah, you did. Twice now.

04:38.930 --> 04:40.323
But you can text me
the news again

04:40.367 --> 04:41.890
if you want to go
for the trifecta.

04:41.933 --> 04:44.545
Your sarcasm aside,
the offer still stands.

04:44.588 --> 04:47.330
I'm actually headed out to
meet my old writing professor

04:47.374 --> 04:49.245
to talk through
the ideas, but hey,

04:49.289 --> 04:51.029
if he's not helpful, at least
now I know who to call.

04:51.073 --> 04:54.685
Just like you know who to call
if you need fashion tips.

04:55.686 --> 04:56.774
Right.

04:59.864 --> 05:02.693
Shouldn't you be breakfasting
with your new favorite brother?

05:02.737 --> 05:04.913
So I talked to Ben.
Big deal.

05:04.956 --> 05:08.003
Just like I told him, I'm not
taking sides in this war.

05:08.046 --> 05:10.788
You should take sides.
There's no room for Switzerland.

05:10.832 --> 05:13.095
We need to talk about
how to fight back against Ben.

05:13.138 --> 05:15.271
That? See? That's support.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.881
Not too late
to jump to the winning side.

05:16.925 --> 05:18.143
I wouldn't be so cocky.

05:18.187 --> 05:20.363
Ben said he talked
to Thomas's old lawyer

05:20.407 --> 05:21.973
and found out you had

05:22.017 --> 05:24.846
several conversations
after your mother died.

05:24.889 --> 05:26.238
You better watch out.

05:26.282 --> 05:27.892
Why? Those conversations
are privileged.

05:27.936 --> 05:29.807
Not if they're illegal.
You can't pressure someone

05:29.851 --> 05:32.810
to change their will
based on false information.

05:32.854 --> 05:34.290
So Ben

05:34.334 --> 05:36.031
is going to subpoena
those documents

05:36.074 --> 05:37.380
to prove you did it.

05:37.424 --> 05:40.078
Luckily, none of it involves me,

05:40.122 --> 05:42.037
so ta-ta.

05:42.080 --> 05:45.301
Is that true? Did you meet with
Grandfather's lawyer back then?

05:45.345 --> 05:46.824
Yeah, I met
with Joel Harris a few times.

05:46.868 --> 05:48.173
And I told him

05:48.217 --> 05:50.001
to advise my father
to cut Ben out of the will

05:50.045 --> 05:52.090
not because
of some false information

05:52.134 --> 05:55.093
but based on the fact
that Ben killed our mother.

05:55.137 --> 05:57.095
I don't think any of
this matters in court.

05:57.139 --> 05:59.663
You are once again downplaying
the danger of the situation.

05:59.707 --> 06:01.622
I agree.
Harris always had someone

06:01.665 --> 06:03.406
taking notes
during meetings.

06:03.450 --> 06:06.148
Those transcripts must be
what Ben's trying to subpoena.

06:06.191 --> 06:08.672
So we just have to find a way
to stop that from happening.

06:08.716 --> 06:10.021
If we get caught tampering
with evidence,

06:10.065 --> 06:11.806
it'll only make things
much worse.

06:11.849 --> 06:13.938
So then we won't get caught.
What else are we gonna do,

06:13.982 --> 06:15.810
cross our fingers
and hope that the lawyers

06:15.853 --> 06:18.334
have the case tossed out?
No. That's not gonna work.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.205
What exactly
do you suggest we do?

06:20.249 --> 06:22.077
- Destroy the records.
- Destroy the records.

06:22.120 --> 06:25.385
You see? <i>
- This</i> is the Carrington way.
What is?

06:25.428 --> 06:27.343
Going to jail before
the trial even begins?

06:27.387 --> 06:29.998
- Blake.
- No, I'm with Fallon on this.

06:30.041 --> 06:32.174
If we cut Ben off at the knees
before the trial starts,

06:32.217 --> 06:34.655
it's worth the risk.
I'm glad you're in my corner.

06:34.698 --> 06:36.439
Well,
it's not just about you anymore.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.267
It's about everything
I've been working towards

06:38.310 --> 06:40.400
and the legacy I'm building
for my family.

06:40.443 --> 06:41.618
Well, I take it back, then.

06:41.662 --> 06:43.446
Too late.
I'm not having my child

06:43.490 --> 06:45.056
born into a Carrington war.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.971
I want him or her growing up

06:47.015 --> 06:49.060
knowing that we are doing
a lot of good in the world.

06:49.104 --> 06:51.280
All of us want that, Fallon. Maybe.

06:51.323 --> 06:52.629
But I'm the one
who's actually willing

06:52.673 --> 06:53.935
to do something about it.

07:03.814 --> 07:05.990
Oh, I'm sorry.
The club's not open yet.

07:06.034 --> 07:07.601
Not for a few more hours.
Well, then,

07:07.644 --> 07:09.211
<i>I'm</i> sorry.

07:09.254 --> 07:10.821
I was just looking
for a place to grab a beer,

07:10.865 --> 07:11.953
watch the Atlantix game.

07:11.996 --> 07:13.476
Oh, you should go
over to La Mirage.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.477
Actually,

07:14.521 --> 07:16.348
if you give me a couple seconds,

07:16.392 --> 07:17.654
I can walk you over to the bar,

07:17.698 --> 07:18.873
put the game on for you.

07:18.916 --> 07:20.527
That'd be great. Thanks.

07:20.570 --> 07:23.138
By any chance,
do they have a chocolate tart?

07:23.181 --> 07:24.618
I have a sweet tooth

07:24.661 --> 07:26.446
that's calling for some
attention. Unless it's a cavity.

07:26.489 --> 07:28.360
They do indeed serve
a chocolate tart,

07:28.404 --> 07:30.885
which happens to be
my favorite dessert.

07:30.928 --> 07:34.932
So, you love beer,
- soccer and chocolate?
- Yeah.

07:34.976 --> 07:36.804
Did Sam put you up to this?

07:36.847 --> 07:39.459
- Are you a waitress?
- I have no idea who Sam is

07:39.502 --> 07:41.112
or why you think
I work in hospitality,

07:41.156 --> 07:42.766
but as long as you're
walking me over,

07:42.810 --> 07:44.551
you want to join me
for the game and some dessert?

07:44.594 --> 07:45.856
This may sound weird,

07:45.900 --> 07:47.728
especially since we met
four seconds ago,

07:47.771 --> 07:51.166
but I'm not really looking
- to date anyone right now.
- Ah.

07:51.209 --> 07:53.777
Neither am I.
Another thing we have in common.

07:53.821 --> 07:56.606
This would be a not-date.
No strings.

07:56.650 --> 07:58.956
So, a stringless not-date.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.046
That I can probably do.

08:02.090 --> 08:04.353
But I still have a little more
work, so is it okay

08:04.396 --> 08:06.921
if our not-date
happened later tonight?

08:06.964 --> 08:09.053
Yeah. Yeah, that works for me.

08:09.097 --> 08:10.968
<i>No need to panic</i>

08:11.012 --> 08:14.102
when you have the key
to eternal youth right here.

08:14.145 --> 08:15.538
That skin cream

08:15.582 --> 08:17.758
may keep your face young
for a little while,

08:17.801 --> 08:19.281
but use too much,
and you'll end up

08:19.324 --> 08:21.588
with a rapidly
deteriorating brain

08:21.631 --> 08:23.720
like this one.

08:23.764 --> 08:25.983
The only thing
rapidly deteriorating

08:26.027 --> 08:27.724
is my patience for you.

08:27.768 --> 08:30.031
Well, then you should be
happy that you get to handle

08:30.074 --> 08:32.599
the FSN anniversary
show by yourself.

08:32.642 --> 08:35.384
I'll miss you, Dominoes.

08:35.427 --> 08:37.995
But I have a brief hiatus

08:38.039 --> 08:41.129
to work on my Final Five project

08:41.172 --> 08:42.130
for NordicStar.

08:42.173 --> 08:43.740
Oh, that's too bad.

08:43.784 --> 08:45.350
"We'll miss you,"
said no one.

08:45.394 --> 08:48.876
Well, that's our show.
One of us will see you tomorrow.

08:48.919 --> 08:51.095
Okay, that's a wrap.

08:51.139 --> 08:52.793
Try not to mess it up
while I'm gone.

08:52.836 --> 08:54.055
Try not to come back.

08:57.145 --> 08:59.582
Great show, Mother. And Dom's
temporary absence is perfect.

08:59.626 --> 09:03.020
I can step in
and talk up my Adam Injection.

09:03.064 --> 09:05.588
First, don't ever
call it that again. Second,

09:05.632 --> 09:08.112
the injectable is not a
direct-to-consumer product.

09:08.156 --> 09:09.418
It doesn't belong on FSN.

09:09.461 --> 09:11.246
It needs to be sold
in a doctor's office.

09:11.289 --> 09:14.249
No, I don't want to sell it
on FSN. I want to build buzz.

09:14.292 --> 09:17.252
I want, to, you know,
talk about the injection on air,

09:17.295 --> 09:19.515
encourage women to go
to their dermatologists.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.039
You know, research shows
that sales double when patients

09:22.083 --> 09:23.606
make requests.
Do you have a tic,

09:23.650 --> 09:25.042
or are you just so used
to saying no to me?

09:25.086 --> 09:26.870
I am the face of the company.
Not you.

09:26.914 --> 09:28.611
Let's not confuse things.

09:28.655 --> 09:30.613
The only confusion is
why you wouldn't do something

09:30.657 --> 09:31.962
that would help the company.

09:32.006 --> 09:33.921
I understand,
but I don't trust you

09:33.964 --> 09:35.792
to announce the injectable
on air.

09:35.836 --> 09:38.012
You are a bit of a wild card.

09:38.055 --> 09:39.361
But don't worry, dear.

09:39.404 --> 09:41.319
We'll work
on the launch strategy together.

09:41.363 --> 09:42.625
Later.

09:42.669 --> 09:44.061
But...

09:45.062 --> 09:47.891
These ideas are all
very... workmanlike.

09:47.935 --> 09:49.676
I'm gonna choose

09:49.719 --> 09:51.503
to not take that
as the insult it sounds like.

09:51.547 --> 09:53.331
Well,
I guess that's your choice.

09:53.375 --> 09:56.247
- Is there one idea that you like?
- Which idea I like

09:56.291 --> 09:58.162
is unrelated
to what you should write.

09:58.206 --> 10:00.077
Where's the confidence you
used to wear like armor

10:00.121 --> 10:01.905
when you first set foot
in my lecture hall?

10:01.949 --> 10:03.951
That was
a long time ago, Professor.

10:03.994 --> 10:06.388
Look, and honestly, I-I reached
out to you because I'm not

10:06.431 --> 10:07.998
feeling confident at all
these days.

10:08.042 --> 10:09.565
I mean, the pressure
of living up to my last book

10:09.609 --> 10:11.045
and now movie?
Like, it's just...

10:11.088 --> 10:12.916
It's messing with my head.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.614
Oh, I've been there.
A million ideas

10:14.657 --> 10:16.180
and no depth to any of them.

10:16.224 --> 10:17.442
Well, I didn't say that.

10:17.486 --> 10:18.879
No, I did.

10:18.922 --> 10:21.142
That's what's
happening here, Liam.

10:21.185 --> 10:22.622
You're swimming
in the shallow end.

10:24.232 --> 10:25.755
Okay, so,
how do I get to the deep end?

10:25.799 --> 10:27.322
That's up to you.

10:27.365 --> 10:29.498
I don't teach swimming.
I teach literature.

10:29.541 --> 10:31.587
Look, why don't you come
talk to my class next week?

10:31.631 --> 10:34.938
You can tell them what it's like
to be a professional writer.

10:34.982 --> 10:37.506
Look, as much as I would love
humiliating myself

10:37.549 --> 10:38.986
in front of your class,
I think I, uh,

10:39.029 --> 10:40.596
need to focus
on getting to the deep end.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.771
Okay.

10:41.815 --> 10:43.599
Just don't drown in metaphors.

10:44.774 --> 10:47.516
So, I spoke to a contact
in Savannah

10:47.559 --> 10:48.865
who's worked with Harris,

10:48.909 --> 10:50.388
and he does still have
a secretary

10:50.432 --> 10:52.347
who transcribes
every client conversation.

10:52.390 --> 10:54.697
So what now? You go in
pretending to be a new client

10:54.741 --> 10:56.003
worried about confidentiality

10:56.046 --> 10:57.569
and ask where the
conversations are stored?

10:57.613 --> 10:59.441
I was gonna make it sound
much more exciting than that,

10:59.484 --> 11:00.877
but yeah,
that's basically the plan.

11:00.921 --> 11:02.574
I think that's too risky.

11:02.618 --> 11:03.880
I can just have one of my guys
can break in after hours

11:03.924 --> 11:05.534
and steal the records.

11:05.577 --> 11:07.275
We still don't know
where the files are stored.

11:07.318 --> 11:10.539
And Harris's assistant
is a sweet old lady named Ida

11:10.582 --> 11:12.454
who loves to gab.
It'll be perfect.

11:12.497 --> 11:13.673
Old ladies love me.

11:14.499 --> 11:16.066
Well, they don't hate me.

11:16.110 --> 11:17.894
Let me go to Savannah with you.

11:17.938 --> 11:19.940
Obviously, Blake can't go
because Harris knows him.

11:19.983 --> 11:21.506
Does he know you?

11:21.550 --> 11:23.117
Well, he hasn't seen me
since I was a child.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.727
But I don't want you
coming to Savannah with me.

11:24.771 --> 11:26.337
You just don't have
the Carrington backbone

11:26.381 --> 11:28.339
for this type of thing.
No offense.

11:28.383 --> 11:29.906
Well, guess what? I'm offended.

11:29.950 --> 11:31.168
See? No backbone.

11:31.212 --> 11:32.866
Enough! All right?

11:32.909 --> 11:34.302
You need her help, Fallon.

11:34.345 --> 11:36.260
Someone needs to deal
with Harris

11:36.304 --> 11:38.132
while you find the files.

11:38.175 --> 11:39.829
We're all on the
same team here.

11:39.873 --> 11:41.613
And some of us know
how to play better with others.

11:41.657 --> 11:43.093
She goes with you.

11:43.137 --> 11:44.747
Fine. She can come with me.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.662
Just don't get in my way.

11:48.011 --> 11:50.622
Saw your post on social
media about the Final Five.

11:50.666 --> 11:52.146
Thought you might want
to celebrate.

11:52.189 --> 11:53.843
Nothing personal,
but I'm not really in the mood

11:53.887 --> 11:55.105
for celebrating right now.

11:55.149 --> 11:57.064
Why? Did something happen?

11:57.107 --> 11:59.631
What happened is it's one thing
to wow on the page.

11:59.675 --> 12:01.938
It's another to go
from the page to the stage.

12:01.982 --> 12:04.419
Do you remember
the party I threw

12:04.462 --> 12:05.812
after my junior prom?

12:05.855 --> 12:09.032
I don't remember much of it.

12:09.076 --> 12:12.688
Probably because of that same
cheap liquor you brought over.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.124
You still drink that stuff?

12:14.168 --> 12:15.560
Yeah, on special occasions.

12:15.604 --> 12:18.215
Your mom was so mad
when she found out

12:18.259 --> 12:20.087
you'd snuck out to party
with us. You remember?

12:20.130 --> 12:23.133
Especially because my friends
were all so into you.

12:23.177 --> 12:25.527
She grounded me for a month.
That much I do remember.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.877
Point is, you have a wow factor
without even trying.

12:27.921 --> 12:29.487
So just treat the judges

12:29.531 --> 12:30.967
of this contest the same way.

12:31.011 --> 12:33.491
Do your thing,
and you'll be amazing.

12:33.535 --> 12:35.102
That's easier said than done.

12:35.145 --> 12:36.451
You know, a critic once said

12:36.494 --> 12:37.582
that Marc Chagall
couldn't draw well,

12:37.626 --> 12:39.280
but the <i>Four Seasons</i>

12:39.323 --> 12:42.239
is one of the most beautiful
mosaics I've ever seen.

12:42.283 --> 12:43.719
He wouldn't have made that
piece if he gave a crap

12:43.763 --> 12:45.068
about what other people
thought of him.

12:45.112 --> 12:48.680
You have just given me
a delicious idea.

12:48.724 --> 12:51.553
Maybe I can do my version

12:51.596 --> 12:53.250
of the <i>Four Seasons.</i>

12:53.294 --> 12:56.558
A uniform for each one.

12:56.601 --> 12:58.603
So your solution
is to quadruple your work?

12:58.647 --> 13:00.518
It will definitely set me apart.

13:00.562 --> 13:04.000
Hey, uh, one question.

13:05.132 --> 13:06.481
You didn't tell Blake
about my plans

13:06.524 --> 13:08.918
to subpoena our father's lawyer,
did you?

13:08.962 --> 13:10.964
I may have mentioned it.

13:11.007 --> 13:13.096
I told you.
No more secrets,

13:13.140 --> 13:16.839
remember? Honestly, you
and Blake are exactly the same.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.101
Exhausting.

13:18.145 --> 13:20.451
Oof, don't ever say that again.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.541
I'll leave you to it.

13:23.585 --> 13:26.109
Maybe leave some of that
cheap stuff while you're at it.

13:27.937 --> 13:28.938
<i>Mother,</i>

13:28.982 --> 13:30.331
I brought you your favorite,

13:30.374 --> 13:32.028
strawberry-nana.

13:32.072 --> 13:35.989
Oh, this reeks of bribery and...

13:36.032 --> 13:37.817
banana.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.993
- Hmm.
- Okay. Well, if you have a couple minutes.

13:40.036 --> 13:42.560
I have a presentation
on how cosmetic treatments

13:42.604 --> 13:45.868
sell five times better
when presented by a doctor.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.304
I am not in the mood
for a book report.

13:47.348 --> 13:48.479
Okay, look,
I know you said you...

13:48.523 --> 13:50.264
you don't trust me to go on air,

13:50.307 --> 13:52.092
but I want to prove to you
that you can.

13:52.135 --> 13:53.833
I'm-I'm ready.
I have these facts.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.660
You've misunderstood.

13:55.704 --> 13:58.794
The facts are not the issue.
It is the fact

13:58.838 --> 14:00.013
that my children

14:00.056 --> 14:02.015
all want to steal my thunder
for some reason.

14:02.058 --> 14:05.279
Fallon announcing her surrogate
at my wedding.

14:05.322 --> 14:08.412
Amanda announcing
her relationship

14:08.456 --> 14:10.850
with Crocodile Dimwit
at my wedding.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.503
And you already announcing

14:12.547 --> 14:14.288
the injectable at my wedding.

14:14.331 --> 14:17.465
And now you want to do it again
on my show.

14:18.509 --> 14:19.510
Is there just nothing

14:19.554 --> 14:21.425
that I can do that is...

14:22.339 --> 14:24.907
...my own? It's... It just...

14:24.951 --> 14:27.475
It makes me... It...

14:27.518 --> 14:29.694
All right. All right.

14:29.738 --> 14:31.000
All right, Mother. Very funny.

14:32.262 --> 14:34.090
Okay, just... You can stop
with the melodrama now.

14:34.134 --> 14:35.875
Oh, my God.

14:35.918 --> 14:37.485
I don't feel good.

14:37.528 --> 14:39.487
Oh, no. Oh.

14:39.530 --> 14:41.489
Oh, you're burning up.

14:41.532 --> 14:43.839
- I need to sit down.
- Okay. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.

14:51.325 --> 14:54.589
I just don't understand why
Cristal has to insert herself

14:54.632 --> 14:55.851
into everything.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.200
I mean, it was fine
when it was just PPA,

14:57.244 --> 14:59.333
but now I have to go babysit her
in Savannah?

14:59.376 --> 15:01.639
Maybe she's just trying to help.
I thought the two of you

15:01.683 --> 15:02.771
were getting along.
Actually, if you don't mind...

15:02.814 --> 15:04.338
Yes, yes, yes, she helped me

15:04.381 --> 15:05.905
when I realized
that I couldn't get pregnant,

15:05.948 --> 15:07.776
but, you know, that's the sort
of thing that she's good at.

15:07.819 --> 15:09.256
Softer stuff.

15:09.299 --> 15:12.128
And right now, I need a fighter,
not a hugger.

15:12.172 --> 15:14.391
Honestly, I'd rather go
to Savannah with you.

15:14.435 --> 15:16.611
Well, I'd love to,
but I'm trying to write.

15:16.654 --> 15:18.091
All I see is a blank screen.

15:18.134 --> 15:19.309
Because you won't let me think.

15:19.353 --> 15:21.050
Okay? It's-it's a process.

15:21.094 --> 15:23.574
Okay. You don't have to tell me
when I'm not wanted.

15:23.618 --> 15:25.098
I can take a hint.

15:25.141 --> 15:26.926
Are you sure about that?

15:26.969 --> 15:28.753
Good luck today.

15:30.625 --> 15:31.669

Would you kill me if
I cancelled our plans tonight?

16:35.603 --> 16:38.954
I'm not a violent man,
so it depends on the reason.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.174
I kinda have a date tonight.

16:41.217 --> 16:43.132
Or a not-date.

16:43.176 --> 16:46.614
What happened to not dating?
Or not not-dating?

16:46.657 --> 16:48.485
I'm confused.
There's a lot of negatives here.

16:48.529 --> 16:50.313
Look, I wasn't looking for it,

16:50.357 --> 16:53.055
but I met this woman,
she seems great,

16:53.099 --> 16:55.971
and it feels a little silly
to not let it play out.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.451
But I could postpone it
if you want me to.

16:57.494 --> 16:59.757
No, absolutely not.

16:59.801 --> 17:02.195
You know what, I always knew
you'd find someone

17:02.238 --> 17:04.153
if you just stopped
trying so hard.

17:04.197 --> 17:06.590
You mean if <i>you</i> stopped
trying so hard.

17:06.634 --> 17:08.244
Well, since you didn't
let me set you up,

17:08.288 --> 17:09.637
at least let me put together
a nice dinner at Oasis

17:09.680 --> 17:10.812
for the two of you.

17:10.855 --> 17:12.422
What do you know about her?

17:12.466 --> 17:15.121
I know she likes beer,
- soccer and chocolate.
- Oh, wow.

17:15.164 --> 17:16.383
Did you meet the female you?

17:16.426 --> 17:18.863
Maybe. Is that weird?

17:18.907 --> 17:22.606
No. At least you're
a pleasure to be around.

17:22.650 --> 17:23.781
Meet me here at 8:00.

17:28.264 --> 17:30.875
Okay, I'll let her know.

17:30.919 --> 17:32.355
What did the network say?

17:32.399 --> 17:34.836
You can't do the FSN
anniversary show tomorrow

17:34.879 --> 17:35.924
if you're sick.

17:35.967 --> 17:37.665
And according to
this thermometer,

17:37.708 --> 17:39.014
which is practically
melting in my hand,

17:39.058 --> 17:40.363
your fever is still raging.

17:40.407 --> 17:42.322
This is ridiculous!

17:42.365 --> 17:45.281
Look, just take the antivirals
that I prescribed you, and--

17:45.325 --> 17:46.935
and drink this smoothie.

17:46.978 --> 17:48.502
It's got tons of
vitamin C in it.

17:48.545 --> 17:52.114
Alexam will lose thousands
of orders if I miss this show.

17:52.158 --> 17:55.335
Th-There has to be a way
to speed up recovery.

17:55.378 --> 17:56.988
Drink the smoothie.

17:57.032 --> 17:58.816
It'll make you feel better.

17:58.860 --> 18:00.514
And I'll go on FSN.

18:00.557 --> 18:02.385
I will prevent Alexam
from taking a hit.

18:02.429 --> 18:04.779
- I'm fully prepared.
- Fine.

18:04.822 --> 18:06.911
I will stay in bed,

18:06.955 --> 18:10.089
and you go present at FSN,
just like you wanted.

18:10.132 --> 18:12.221
I'm sorry this is the
way it turned out,

18:12.265 --> 18:14.745
but I truly believe this is
the best for everyone.

18:14.789 --> 18:16.921
All right?

18:18.706 --> 18:20.969
Psst!

18:21.012 --> 18:23.667
Ugh, get rid of that,
and don't drink it

18:23.711 --> 18:25.843
unless you want to end up
as sick as I am.

18:25.887 --> 18:29.673
Ugh, this is why people
don't trust doctors.

18:29.717 --> 18:32.154
Or sons.

18:32.198 --> 18:34.417
<i>Just to make sure</i> <i>
we're on the same page,</i>

18:34.461 --> 18:35.853
you're getting the lawyer
out of the room,

18:35.897 --> 18:37.203
and I'll get the
assistant talking.

18:37.246 --> 18:39.248
Or maybe we reverse that.

18:39.292 --> 18:41.946
You get the lawyer out
and I talk to the assistant.

18:41.990 --> 18:43.818
I have a little more finesse
with people.

18:43.861 --> 18:45.341
Yeah, that's not happening.

18:45.385 --> 18:47.778
Finesse is just a polite way
of saying weak.

18:47.822 --> 18:49.389
You're being very unpleasant.

18:49.432 --> 18:51.391
I don't know why you're doubting
me. I've done nothing...

18:51.434 --> 18:55.569
I am so sorry
for the wait.

18:55.612 --> 18:58.485
Ida here is just going
to set up her stenotype

18:58.528 --> 19:00.313
for the meeting,
if that's okay.

19:00.356 --> 19:03.403
Oh, that's more than okay.
It's perfect.

19:03.446 --> 19:05.753
Okay, then.
Now, how can I help?

19:05.796 --> 19:08.799
Your email said something
about estate planning.

19:08.843 --> 19:10.149
Now, how are you related?

19:10.192 --> 19:12.281
- We're sisters.
- We're business partners.

19:12.325 --> 19:13.500
We're sister
- business partners.
- Stepsisters.

19:13.543 --> 19:15.023
Stepsister business
partners, yeah.

19:15.066 --> 19:18.331
So you want a plan that will
protect your business

19:18.374 --> 19:20.898
- and personal assets?
- Exactly.

19:20.942 --> 19:23.988
We just want to be prepared
in case my stepsister

19:24.032 --> 19:26.904
passes away suddenly,
you know.

19:26.948 --> 19:28.471
Because she is so frail.

19:28.515 --> 19:29.559
Or if she does.

19:29.603 --> 19:30.995
She's great at making enemies.

19:31.039 --> 19:32.736
Yeah. Although, I do
think it will be her.

19:32.780 --> 19:34.738
I do. Just because she is
so much older.

19:34.782 --> 19:36.087
Aren't you, Gretchen?

19:36.131 --> 19:38.002
Though, you did mention to me,

19:38.046 --> 19:39.613
that you wanted to speak
to Mr. Harris

19:39.656 --> 19:40.788
in private, didn't you?

19:40.831 --> 19:43.747
Yes, Ingrid, I do. Yeah.

19:43.791 --> 19:46.881
Could we go into that conference
room I saw in the hall?

19:46.924 --> 19:48.317
No problem.

19:48.361 --> 19:50.972
It'll just take a minute
for Ida to pack up.

19:51.015 --> 19:54.149
Oh, I'd prefer Ida stay here.
I really value my privacy.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.759
Well, lead the way.

20:02.505 --> 20:04.899
So, Ida, um... Yes.

20:04.942 --> 20:08.076
Speaking of privacy,
what do you do with

20:08.119 --> 20:10.209
all the notes you take
on that little doo-dad there?

20:10.252 --> 20:13.473
We take very good care of our
clients' private conversations.

20:13.516 --> 20:14.909
Well, that sounds
a little vague.

20:14.952 --> 20:16.780
I just think I would
feel more comfortable

20:16.824 --> 20:19.653
knowing exactly where
you kept the transcriptions.

20:19.696 --> 20:20.697
You know, since
we're considering

20:20.741 --> 20:21.959
bringing our business here.

20:22.003 --> 20:23.222
Well, they're kept
in a safe place.

20:23.265 --> 20:24.484
No need to worry.

20:24.527 --> 20:26.964
I can't help it.
I'm a worrier, Ida.

20:27.008 --> 20:28.531
You know, I went through
a very bad experience

20:28.575 --> 20:30.098
with my last divorce.

20:30.141 --> 20:32.970
Leaked files.
- A disaster in court.
- Oh, dear.

20:33.014 --> 20:34.233
I'm so sorry.

20:34.276 --> 20:35.625
Thank you, thank you.

20:35.669 --> 20:36.974
So we're talking about
computer files or...

20:37.018 --> 20:41.283
Computer files?
Well, I wish.

20:41.327 --> 20:44.417
Mr. Harris isn't good
with change or technology.

20:44.460 --> 20:47.115
Now, the printed copies are
stored in a file room

20:47.158 --> 20:49.073
just on the other side
of the bathroom.

20:49.117 --> 20:50.640
You walked by it
on your way in.

20:50.684 --> 20:53.687
Every conversation
since the '80s are in there.

20:53.730 --> 20:55.471
Does that reassure you?

20:55.515 --> 20:58.735
Oh, it sure does.
You're a peach, Ida.

20:58.779 --> 21:00.389
And you know what,
just to make you feel

21:00.433 --> 21:02.783
a little bit more secure,
we have a guard that

21:02.826 --> 21:04.393
watches the building overnight.

21:04.437 --> 21:07.222
So you definitely don't have
to fret about your privacy.

21:13.533 --> 21:16.971
Wow, this seems like
a lot for a not-date.

21:17.014 --> 21:18.451
Yeah, maybe.

21:18.494 --> 21:20.844
Hello, hello.
Sammy Jo Jones. Hi.

21:20.888 --> 21:22.585
It is lovely to meet you.

21:22.629 --> 21:24.500
I'm just coming over to see
how you're enjoying your meal.

21:24.544 --> 21:26.154
Do you need anything?

21:26.197 --> 21:27.677
A little privacy, maybe?

21:27.721 --> 21:29.766
Well, that's not on the menu.
I'm sorry.

21:29.810 --> 21:31.333
No, I'm kidding.

21:31.377 --> 21:32.595
I'll leave you two alone.

21:32.639 --> 21:35.337
And of course, the meal is
on the house.

21:35.381 --> 21:36.773
Wow.
All right?
Yes.

21:36.817 --> 21:38.079
Okay.
Thank you.

21:38.122 --> 21:39.776
- All right. Bye-bye.
- Bye, now. Okay.

21:39.820 --> 21:42.431
So, um, are all the bartenders
treated so well here?

21:42.475 --> 21:45.434
Bartenders? Oh, no,
I'm not a bartender.

21:45.478 --> 21:48.394
Although you would not be
the first woman to assume that.

21:48.437 --> 21:52.136
I actually am the co-owner
of this place with Sam.

21:52.180 --> 21:53.573
Oh, wow.

21:53.616 --> 21:54.922
And what do you do?

21:54.965 --> 21:56.402
Oh, I'm between
jobs right now.

21:56.445 --> 21:57.881
My husband passed
away last year,

21:57.925 --> 21:59.318
so I've been dealing with that.

21:59.361 --> 22:00.884
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

22:00.928 --> 22:03.409
Thank you.

22:03.452 --> 22:05.628
I actually am, uh,
I'm finally feeling

22:05.672 --> 22:07.804
ready to move forward.

22:07.848 --> 22:10.503
And this is the first,
and the best,

22:10.546 --> 22:12.287
not-date I've ever been on.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.420
Right?
Mm-hmm.

22:14.463 --> 22:17.727
It is amazing how we keep
thinking the same thing.

22:17.771 --> 22:18.989
Really?
Mm-hmm.

22:19.033 --> 22:20.600
Hmm. So tell me,

22:20.643 --> 22:22.602
what do you think about this?

22:22.645 --> 22:25.126
Since you own the place... Mm-hmm.

22:25.169 --> 22:27.215
...how do you feel about
skipping dinner

22:27.258 --> 22:29.130
and showing me one
of the rooms here?

22:29.173 --> 22:32.394
I'm thinking that
that's a great idea.

22:32.438 --> 22:35.136
All right, all right,
all right.

22:35.179 --> 22:36.833
We got champagne.

22:36.877 --> 22:39.488
Mm, whoa-ho-ho!

22:39.532 --> 22:41.838
Oh.

22:43.492 --> 22:46.277
Oh. Okay.

22:53.110 --> 22:55.330
Okay, we've watched
this guy enough.

22:55.374 --> 22:56.810
He comes around
every nine minutes.

22:56.853 --> 22:59.769
I say the next time
he rounds the corner,

22:59.813 --> 23:02.729
- we go for it.
- Whoa. Hold on.

23:02.772 --> 23:06.080
This has "disaster"
written all over it.

23:06.123 --> 23:07.690
That security guard
has a gun.

23:07.734 --> 23:09.475
I think we should
reconsider the plan.

23:09.518 --> 23:11.215
Unless you want
to get shot again.

23:11.259 --> 23:13.696
Why did you even come here?

23:13.740 --> 23:16.177
I have been on your case
all day because I thought

23:16.220 --> 23:18.440
you needed a little
push to get tougher.

23:18.484 --> 23:20.399
But now I can tell that
you don't care enough

23:20.442 --> 23:22.357
about my family to actually
take a risk for it.

23:22.401 --> 23:25.839
Taking a crowbar to a window
isn't a risk, it's stupid.

23:25.882 --> 23:28.885
And a different opinion
doesn't mean I don't care.

23:28.929 --> 23:30.583
I came with you to protect you

23:30.626 --> 23:32.541
from messing up everything
you've been building.

23:32.585 --> 23:34.674
But you've been too busy
pushing me away to even notice.

23:34.717 --> 23:37.546
Getting in my way
is not protecting me.

23:37.590 --> 23:39.374
It's just annoying.

23:39.418 --> 23:42.551
After all these years, and
everything we've been through,

23:42.595 --> 23:44.684
you still think
you know best, don't you?

23:44.727 --> 23:46.947
- It's my curse.
- You know what,

23:46.990 --> 23:48.122
it's been a long day.

23:48.165 --> 23:49.253
I'll find my own way home.

23:49.297 --> 23:51.908
Great. I'll handle this myself.

23:51.952 --> 23:53.214
Oh, I'm sure you will.

23:53.257 --> 23:54.955
And when you teach
your future child

23:54.998 --> 23:56.565
how to push everyone away, too,

23:56.609 --> 23:58.349
I'll be happy to pay
the therapy bills.

24:03.354 --> 24:05.226
<i>In case of an emergency,</i>

24:05.269 --> 24:07.881
please find your nearest exits.

24:07.924 --> 24:09.535
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

24:09.578 --> 24:11.275
Jeff is out of town,
and I need a model.

24:11.319 --> 24:13.887
Besides, you said it was
a welcome distraction

24:13.930 --> 24:15.845
from staring at
your blank computer screen.

24:15.889 --> 24:18.413
- How are the sleeves?
- Oh, perfect.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.023
I was trying all day
to figure out

24:20.067 --> 24:22.461
what I'm feeling inside,
but it turns out

24:22.504 --> 24:24.463
it was two sheets of brownies
and a gallon of milk.

24:24.506 --> 24:26.769
That's why I prefer to
keep my mind off things.

24:26.813 --> 24:28.292
I thought you said
you had to do this

24:28.336 --> 24:29.946
for the NordicStar contest.

24:29.990 --> 24:33.036
I do, but it's also
helping me stay sane

24:33.080 --> 24:35.952
in the middle of all of this
Blake/Ben ridiculousness.

24:35.996 --> 24:37.693
I guess living in creativity
is better than living

24:37.737 --> 24:38.868
in family drama.

24:38.912 --> 24:40.740
Exactly.
It's better to be busy

24:40.783 --> 24:42.742
than wrapped up in
your own thoughts all the time.

24:43.917 --> 24:47.573
Demonstrate putting a carry-on
in the overhead compartment.

24:51.446 --> 24:53.100
Okay, this is riding up
a little bit.

24:53.143 --> 24:56.364
Yeah, yeah, I felt I needed
a little more coverage there.

24:57.670 --> 24:58.714
Mother, what are you
doing here?

24:58.758 --> 25:00.411
You should be at home resting.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.461
Per my doctor's advice,

25:06.505 --> 25:11.205
my real doctor, the only thing
I need to rest

25:11.248 --> 25:12.598
is my voice until I go on air.

25:12.641 --> 25:15.949
You can't go on air.
You're still sick.

25:15.992 --> 25:18.604
You're the sick one.

25:18.647 --> 25:21.955
Sorry your evil plan
didn't work out.

25:21.998 --> 25:25.088
My evil plan? What on earth
are you talking about?

25:25.132 --> 25:27.264
I've been trying to help you.

25:28.614 --> 25:31.181
Like you were helping
with that poison smoogie?

25:31.225 --> 25:33.270
What's a smoogie?

25:33.314 --> 25:35.751
Smoogie. Smoogie.

25:35.795 --> 25:37.405
Smoothie!

25:37.448 --> 25:39.625
You think I was trying to
poison you with a smoothie?

25:39.668 --> 25:41.452
I don't think, I know.

25:41.496 --> 25:43.803
And now you have ruined
strawberry-nana for me forever.

25:43.846 --> 25:46.849
I was drinking the same one.
I wasn't poisoning you.

25:46.893 --> 25:48.547
You just went on your honeymoon.

25:48.590 --> 25:50.070
Maybe you caught
something overseas.

25:50.113 --> 25:53.464
The only thing
I caught is you.

25:53.508 --> 25:55.858
I am done with my children
trying to upstage me.

25:55.902 --> 25:57.991
There are plenty of stages
for all of us.

25:58.034 --> 26:01.124
I've worked hard
for my success.

26:02.169 --> 26:06.216
And now, on with the snow.

26:12.440 --> 26:13.615
Ha-ha!

26:13.659 --> 26:15.617
Beautiful day, isn't it?

26:15.661 --> 26:18.315
Well, someone's in
a cheerful mood.

26:18.359 --> 26:22.537
I wish I could be as happy about
this tuna melt, but alas...

26:22.581 --> 26:23.886
So I assume your date went well?

26:23.930 --> 26:27.020
Ah, a gentleman never tells.

26:27.063 --> 26:28.543
But yes. Very well.

26:28.587 --> 26:31.590
Well, I'm happy for you.
And for me.

26:31.633 --> 26:33.809
'Cause now the Sasha guilt
is finally gone.

26:33.853 --> 26:35.898
So you really like her, huh?

26:35.942 --> 26:37.378
I know it's only
been one date,

26:37.421 --> 26:39.989
but I feel real potential
with Geneva.

26:40.033 --> 26:41.774
Okay.

26:41.817 --> 26:43.166
- Thanks, Ronnie.
- Mm-hmm.

26:43.210 --> 26:44.428
Can I get you anything,
Mr. Culhane?

26:44.472 --> 26:45.778
Nah, I'm good.
Thanks, though.

26:45.821 --> 26:47.344
So I didn't know you knew
Geneva Abbot.

26:47.388 --> 26:48.955
I saw you two
at dinner last night.

26:48.998 --> 26:50.957
- How do you know her?
- I thought the same way you did.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.046
What does that mean?

26:53.089 --> 26:54.569
- Through her husband.
- Hold on.

26:54.613 --> 26:55.657
- Did you say Abbot?
- Yeah.

26:55.701 --> 26:56.963
I thought her husband
was the guy

26:57.006 --> 26:58.268
who was working on the club
last year.

26:59.705 --> 27:02.664
Uh, you mean Leo?
Leo Abbot?

27:02.708 --> 27:04.405
Yeah, that was his name. Leo.

27:04.448 --> 27:06.886
He was the guy who died.
The contractor, right?

27:06.929 --> 27:08.409
Mm-hmm.

27:08.452 --> 27:10.716
Yes. That's him.

27:10.759 --> 27:13.240
Yeah, she had come by
and visited him a few times.

27:13.283 --> 27:15.851
I met her, and just so sad.

27:15.895 --> 27:17.853
- I hope she's doing okay.
- Yeah.

27:19.246 --> 27:22.466
We need to talk. In private.

27:28.385 --> 27:29.691
What if she knows
everything?

27:29.735 --> 27:32.563
Oh, my God, what if
this is about vengeance,

27:32.607 --> 27:34.653
and she totally seduced you
so that she could kill you?!

27:34.696 --> 27:36.698
If that were true,
I'd already be dead.

27:36.742 --> 27:38.482
And besides, I don't
think she could fake

27:38.526 --> 27:39.483
the connection we had.

27:39.527 --> 27:41.311
Oh, connection?

27:41.355 --> 27:44.532
Like something really electric?
Did you feel sparks?

27:44.575 --> 27:47.753
Okay, again, yes,
she was married to the guy

27:47.796 --> 27:50.843
that we electrocuted,
which led to his...

27:50.886 --> 27:52.453
...death.

27:52.496 --> 27:54.194
Yeah. Not ideal.

27:56.283 --> 27:57.632
Oh, it's her.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.242
"I'd love to see you again.

27:59.286 --> 28:01.723
How about another not-date?"

28:01.767 --> 28:05.248
Only if you want to not-live.
What are you gonna do?

28:06.815 --> 28:08.164
What do you mean,
you didn't go through with it?

28:08.208 --> 28:09.426
It was your idea.

28:09.470 --> 28:10.906
Well, I had the wrong
idea, but now I have

28:10.950 --> 28:13.213
a better plan instead.

28:13.996 --> 28:15.258
Well, what is it?
Oh.

28:15.302 --> 28:16.738
I thought you were
gonna guess it,

28:16.782 --> 28:18.435
like you did last time.
I remembered that

28:18.479 --> 28:20.699
Carrington Atlantic company
policy was to require

28:20.742 --> 28:22.831
personal counseling
to any employees

28:22.875 --> 28:25.094
if an immediate member
of their family had died.

28:25.138 --> 28:28.402
And you think that my father
saw a company-mandated therapist

28:28.445 --> 28:30.447
after my mother died?
No, I highly doubt that.

28:30.491 --> 28:33.102
But if he did, maybe
the therapist mentioned

28:33.146 --> 28:34.843
his disappointment in Ben,
which would relieve you

28:34.887 --> 28:36.802
of any undue influence.

28:36.845 --> 28:40.240
I'm just saying if Ben can
subpoena Grandfather's lawyer,

28:40.283 --> 28:42.633
maybe you can subpoena
his therapist.

28:42.677 --> 28:45.549
That's a few too many "maybes"
for me to be comfortable with.

28:45.593 --> 28:47.290
This whole thing
could be pointless.

28:47.334 --> 28:50.206
Okay, well,
contrary to popular belief,

28:50.250 --> 28:52.861
I do not know everything,
but I do know

28:52.905 --> 28:54.558
that I'm trying really hard

28:54.602 --> 28:56.299
to leave this world
a better place

28:56.343 --> 28:57.779
for my kid.

28:57.823 --> 29:01.174
So playing dirty
no longer fits with that plan.

29:01.217 --> 29:04.786
Well, that's very
mature of you.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.527
You're gonna be a great mother.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.356
Let me call my lawyer

29:09.399 --> 29:10.836
and get that paperwork
in motion.

29:10.879 --> 29:13.229
Great. I just think
it could be worth a shot.

29:19.453 --> 29:24.153
Yeah. Hey, I need you to perform
a run-of-the-mill B&E.

29:24.197 --> 29:28.157
Get some files from
a lawyer's office in Savannah.

29:29.419 --> 29:31.465
As you can see,
I apply the cream

29:31.508 --> 29:36.644
in an upward motion using
the pad of my middle finger.

29:36.687 --> 29:38.298
Whew!

29:38.341 --> 29:40.866
Ah, don't mind me,
I'm just feeling

29:40.909 --> 29:43.216
a little bit of a dewy glow here.

29:43.259 --> 29:44.739
But don't worry, viewers.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.393
I had a small fever yesterday,

29:46.436 --> 29:49.222
and I think I'm just
experiencing residual effect--

29:50.919 --> 29:53.008
Effects.

29:53.052 --> 29:57.404
Luckily for me, my miracle cream
keeps me looking good...

30:00.581 --> 30:02.583
...even if I feel like...

30:04.933 --> 30:06.413
Aw, even if you're feeling

30:06.456 --> 30:07.893
under the weather,
right, Mother?

30:10.939 --> 30:13.028
You... You...

30:13.072 --> 30:16.727
Oh, you can't talk.
We understand.

30:16.771 --> 30:18.686
That's why I'm here.

30:18.729 --> 30:21.645
Hi, I'm Dr. Adam Carrington.

30:21.689 --> 30:23.865
Apparently my mother's been
working so hard

30:23.909 --> 30:25.214
she's made herself sick...

30:25.258 --> 30:27.608
...all to keep your skin
looking flawless.

30:31.568 --> 30:34.180
And I know she'd be
so proud to announce,

30:34.223 --> 30:37.009
if she could,
our newest product:

30:37.052 --> 30:39.228
The Alexam Injectable.

30:39.272 --> 30:41.230
Now, this is gonna
change your life.

30:41.274 --> 30:43.015
But you can only get it
from doctors,

30:43.058 --> 30:44.494
so make sure
you make an appointment

30:44.538 --> 30:46.409
with your dermatologist
this week,

30:46.453 --> 30:48.934
and make sure
they know what to order.

30:48.977 --> 30:50.152
<i>Geneva.</i>

30:50.196 --> 30:52.502
Back again.
What are you doing here?

30:52.546 --> 30:55.549
- Nothing nefarious, I hope.
- Not that I know of.

30:55.592 --> 30:57.638
I'm actually looking
for Michael.

30:57.681 --> 31:00.380
Oh. Is everything okay?

31:00.423 --> 31:02.599
Not really.

31:02.643 --> 31:04.210
I feel like an idiot.

31:04.253 --> 31:06.168
He texted me that he doesn't
want to see me anymore,

31:06.212 --> 31:07.822
but I know we had
a good time together,

31:07.866 --> 31:11.086
so I feel like I deserve
some kind of explanation.

31:11.130 --> 31:14.698
Well, I'm sure he warned you
that he wasn't ready to date.

31:14.742 --> 31:16.918
Maybe you shouldn't have
pressed him on it?

31:16.962 --> 31:19.834
Unless you have
an ulterior motive.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.618
Why would I need
an ulterior motive?

31:21.662 --> 31:23.316
Have you seen what
that man looks like?

31:23.359 --> 31:26.493
Oh, yeah. I mean, I can't argue
with that. He's hot.

31:26.536 --> 31:27.886
I don't know,
I felt like I was

31:27.929 --> 31:29.626
finally moving on,
you know?

31:29.670 --> 31:32.803
Like I was ready to see what
the next chapter would bring.

31:32.847 --> 31:35.284
You must have known
my husband Leo, right?

31:35.328 --> 31:38.070
He was a construction
contractor here before he died.

31:38.113 --> 31:42.074
Yeah, maybe. I might have
a vague memory of him.

31:42.117 --> 31:43.945
I didn't really spend
much time with the workers.

31:43.989 --> 31:47.949
He had an accident here,
- which led to his death.
- No.

31:47.993 --> 31:50.212
I don't know, I just...
I felt like if I came here,

31:50.256 --> 31:52.693
to the place where it happened,
I could say my final goodbye.

31:52.998 --> 31:55.304
Then I met Michael,
on the same day,

31:55.348 --> 31:57.306
and I thought it was a sign.

31:57.350 --> 31:58.960
You know, of a good future.

31:59.004 --> 32:00.440
I don't know,
maybe I was wrong.

32:00.483 --> 32:03.530
This is why I don't normally
believe in signs.

32:03.573 --> 32:05.532
Sorry, sorry, I'm
talking your ear off.

32:06.837 --> 32:08.056
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay, okay. I'm gonna go.

32:08.100 --> 32:10.189
Bye.
Bye.

32:13.844 --> 32:16.021
Did you hear all that?
Yeah.

32:16.064 --> 32:20.242
It sounded like she meant it,
but who knows?

32:20.286 --> 32:22.375
Either way, ending
things with her

32:22.418 --> 32:23.985
was the only thing to do.

32:24.029 --> 32:25.813
I mean, even if she's
not trying to kill you,

32:25.856 --> 32:27.858
it's just way too
dangerous, okay?

32:27.902 --> 32:29.599
And with all of the
women out there...

32:29.643 --> 32:31.210
I can probably find one

32:31.253 --> 32:34.996
whose husband
we did not electrocute.

32:35.040 --> 32:36.867
I know.

32:40.393 --> 32:44.005
Is that a whiff of smoke
wafting away?

32:44.049 --> 32:46.703
Uh, yeah. Yeah, busted.

32:46.747 --> 32:49.054
I went to see
Professor Kingston again today,

32:49.097 --> 32:50.969
and I picked up a little
medicinal inspiration

32:51.012 --> 32:52.274
on the way home.

32:52.318 --> 32:53.493
Seeing your professor
made you want to be

32:53.536 --> 32:55.060
back in college again?

32:55.103 --> 32:57.062
Actually, I am gonna be
back in college again.

32:57.105 --> 32:59.325
Yeah, teaching.
Well, guest lecturing.

32:59.368 --> 33:00.674
Are you sure you know
how to do that?

33:00.717 --> 33:02.110
I'll figure it out,
but thank you

33:02.154 --> 33:03.894
for the vote of confidence.

33:03.938 --> 33:06.027
Yeah, the, uh, the English
department was down a professor,

33:06.071 --> 33:08.464
and Kingston said okay when
I offered to sub in.

33:08.508 --> 33:10.466
But what about your book?
Don't you need to write?

33:10.510 --> 33:11.641
Yeah, I don't-I don't know.

33:11.685 --> 33:12.991
I think this will help.

33:13.034 --> 33:14.905
I mean, being stuck at home
just thinking,

33:14.949 --> 33:17.647
it hasn't been good
for my creativity.

33:17.691 --> 33:19.606
You know, when I was in college,
I was, I was busy.

33:19.649 --> 33:20.999
I was surrounded
by other writers.

33:21.042 --> 33:23.653
I-I never felt
more inspired.

33:23.697 --> 33:24.872
Because you were high.

33:24.915 --> 33:27.483
Very funny.
I-I think I'm just gonna

33:27.527 --> 33:29.877
do this and relax
on the soul-searching.

33:29.920 --> 33:31.835
Sounds like a plan.

33:31.879 --> 33:34.795
I just wish you had
a little more of that medicine

33:34.838 --> 33:36.057
left over to relax me.

33:36.101 --> 33:37.450
What, the caper didn't go well?

33:37.493 --> 33:39.017
The caper didn't go at all.

33:39.060 --> 33:40.975
Cristal mentioned that
it was pretty dangerous,

33:41.019 --> 33:43.456
which was true, although
I would never tell her that.

33:43.499 --> 33:45.719
So you're mad at her
for being right?

33:45.762 --> 33:48.722
No, I'm mad at her whole
Goody Two-shoes attitude.

33:48.765 --> 33:51.638
I don't think she's as pristine
as you think she is.

33:51.681 --> 33:53.335
I mean, Fallon, she put a bounty
on her brother's head

33:53.379 --> 33:55.424
if he ever stepped foot
back in the country.

33:55.468 --> 33:58.079
I mean, if someone messes with
the people that she loves,

33:58.123 --> 33:59.733
the daggers come out.

34:03.911 --> 34:05.173
Thanks.

34:05.217 --> 34:06.783
Great show, Dr. Carrington.

34:06.827 --> 34:08.263
We're so happy
you stepped in.

34:08.307 --> 34:10.265
Well, I'm glad I was here
to help.

34:10.309 --> 34:12.659
Social media loves
the whole mother-son dynamic.

34:12.702 --> 34:15.096
- Oh.
- And we're thinking

34:15.140 --> 34:17.620
you should take a permanent spot
on the show.

34:17.664 --> 34:19.535
That's very kind
of you to offer,

34:19.579 --> 34:20.928
but I'm gonna pass.

34:20.971 --> 34:23.496
My mother will always be
the face of Alexam.

34:23.539 --> 34:25.759
- This was just a one-time thing.
- Oh, that's too bad.

34:25.802 --> 34:27.761
But understood.

34:27.804 --> 34:29.284
You know, you have
a great son here.

34:30.633 --> 34:33.288
You miserable, lying sack of...

34:34.507 --> 34:36.857
Thank you.

34:36.900 --> 34:39.468
You're welcome,
but you're not forgiven

34:39.512 --> 34:42.123
for suggesting that
I poisoned you.

34:42.167 --> 34:45.126
Look, I want this relationship
and our partnership to work,

34:45.170 --> 34:48.651
but if you can't get over these
little trust issues you have,

34:48.695 --> 34:51.219
then we're still
in serious trouble.

35:03.101 --> 35:04.145
Hello, Ben.

35:04.189 --> 35:07.453
You know, it can't be fun

35:07.496 --> 35:10.325
being the brother
who always loses.

35:10.369 --> 35:12.632
Can I help you
drown your sorrows,

35:12.675 --> 35:14.286
like you drowned our mother?

35:14.329 --> 35:17.506
You should keep that
for yourself. You'll need it.

35:17.550 --> 35:19.421
Let me know when
the cryptic, taunting part

35:19.465 --> 35:20.857
of this conversation's over.

35:20.901 --> 35:23.164
Oh, you want specifics?
Happy to help.

35:23.208 --> 35:26.167
You know, ever since
we were kids,

35:26.211 --> 35:28.952
if there was a shortcut
to take, you took it.

35:28.996 --> 35:31.520
I knew Dom would tell you
about the subpoena.

35:31.564 --> 35:33.653
And I knew you wouldn't
be able to help yourself.

35:37.091 --> 35:38.484
I don't know what
you're talking about.

35:38.527 --> 35:39.615
Oh, I think you do know.

35:39.659 --> 35:41.182
But what you don't know

35:41.226 --> 35:42.792
is that I paid a small fee

35:42.836 --> 35:44.403
to the owner of the store
across the street

35:44.446 --> 35:45.665
from Joel Harris' office.

35:45.708 --> 35:47.188
Buying more comic books?

35:47.232 --> 35:49.408
No, just access to his
security camera footage,

35:49.451 --> 35:51.845
which shows a man
in a black ski mask

35:51.888 --> 35:53.847
breaking into Harris' office
earlier tonight,

35:53.890 --> 35:55.196
on your orders, obviously.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.111
Yeah, I'm not following.

35:57.155 --> 35:59.113
And unfortunately for you,

35:59.157 --> 36:01.681
you can't connect any
missing transcripts to me,

36:01.724 --> 36:06.338
or even have them subpoenaed,
since they're missing.

36:06.381 --> 36:09.254
There was never gonna be
a subpoena for the transcripts.

36:09.297 --> 36:11.299
I just needed you
to think there was.

36:11.343 --> 36:13.562
So my lawyer says the judge
will find the timing

36:13.606 --> 36:15.173
of this break-in
highly suspicious,

36:15.216 --> 36:17.740
and now deny your motion
to dismiss the case

36:17.784 --> 36:19.568
based on potential
evidence tampering.

36:22.441 --> 36:24.225
You still won't win.

36:24.269 --> 36:26.532
It feels like I already am.

36:26.575 --> 36:28.055
It's kind of ironic,
don't you think?

36:28.098 --> 36:30.927
You file a motion citing
lack of evidence,

36:30.971 --> 36:32.364
and then give me
the very evidence

36:32.407 --> 36:35.715
I need to move forward, so...
thank you?

36:35.758 --> 36:37.107
Get out of my house.

36:37.151 --> 36:39.022
Oh, you seem upset.
Yeah, okay, well,

36:39.066 --> 36:40.937
I guess it can't be fun
being the brother

36:40.981 --> 36:42.374
who always loses.

36:43.810 --> 36:46.421
See you in court.

36:46.465 --> 36:49.119
There you go.
I got it.

36:56.562 --> 36:59.565
Ah. I've always wanted
to come here.

36:59.608 --> 37:01.393
Well, you mentioned it
the other night,

37:01.436 --> 37:03.786
and I figured
I owed you a real date

37:03.830 --> 37:07.877
to make up for my behavior
- after our not-date.
- Yeah.

37:07.921 --> 37:10.793
I'm glad that
you said yes.
I almost didn't.

37:10.837 --> 37:13.318
I know. That's why I'm glad.

37:13.361 --> 37:15.276
So, uh, what happened?

37:15.320 --> 37:17.278
To be honest?
Yeah.

37:17.322 --> 37:18.714
I got scared.

37:18.758 --> 37:21.239
I figured being in a
relationship with you

37:21.282 --> 37:22.979
might be dangerous.

37:23.023 --> 37:24.938
Aren't all relationships
dangerous?

37:24.981 --> 37:26.244
That's why I decided
to take the leap.

37:26.287 --> 37:28.463
Hmm.
It is not every day

37:28.507 --> 37:30.422
that I meet someone like you.

37:31.814 --> 37:33.425
I'll risk it if you will.

37:33.468 --> 37:35.688
I will.

37:41.520 --> 37:43.478
Mother.

37:43.522 --> 37:45.001
What are you doing
in Kirby's room?

37:45.045 --> 37:46.655
You may not believe this,
but I was on my way

37:46.699 --> 37:48.091
to apologize to you.

37:48.135 --> 37:50.485
By lurking in a room
that doesn't belong to me?

37:50.529 --> 37:52.487
I am not lurking.
You were my next stop.

37:52.531 --> 37:54.620
I spoke with Dex.

37:54.663 --> 37:57.449
He also had a fever
and lost his voice.

37:57.492 --> 37:58.711
We're both fine now,
but apparently

37:58.754 --> 38:00.582
we got some 36-hour bug

38:00.626 --> 38:02.497
during our travels.

38:02.541 --> 38:04.194
You didn't poison me.

38:04.238 --> 38:07.546
It must have been my fever
that made me paranoid.

38:07.589 --> 38:08.895
Oh, the fever.

38:08.938 --> 38:10.679
Okay, fine,
it wasn't just the fever.

38:10.723 --> 38:12.855
My suspicious nature
has always been

38:12.899 --> 38:15.118
a survival tactic, and
sometimes it's hard for me

38:15.162 --> 38:18.557
to shake old habits, so...
I'm sorry.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.559
I understand,
and I accept your apology,

38:20.602 --> 38:23.388
but clearly you're not
breaking old habits

38:23.431 --> 38:25.520
by still sneaking
into Kirby's room.

38:25.564 --> 38:29.307
I came to bring her
this note.

38:29.350 --> 38:32.048
I almost lost you because
of the way I treated Kirby.

38:32.092 --> 38:34.616
I'm not going to lose
Amanda the same way.

38:34.660 --> 38:38.054
You helped me see that I've been
too harsh on my children,

38:38.098 --> 38:42.450
so I wrote Kirby
this apology note.

38:42.494 --> 38:44.757
I can't believe you're actually
gonna apologize to Kirby.

38:44.800 --> 38:47.455
Well, I don't really mean it,
but if this faux-pology

38:47.499 --> 38:48.804
helps me get back on track
with Amanda,

38:48.848 --> 38:50.415
then I am happy to pretend.

38:50.458 --> 38:52.460
Wow, that's almost
mature of you.

38:52.504 --> 38:53.548
Mm.

39:08.215 --> 39:09.608
Hmm.

39:09.651 --> 39:13.786
Kirby's diary. Hmm.

39:13.829 --> 39:16.528
I shouldn't look.
Okay, just a quick peek.

39:18.225 --> 39:19.792
What is this?

39:19.835 --> 39:22.098
A list of every Carrington
secret my father ever learned.

39:22.142 --> 39:25.188
There is enough dirt in here
to take down Blake for good.

39:29.454 --> 39:31.673
Jackpot.

39:37.462 --> 39:39.681
Whoa. Retail therapy?

39:39.725 --> 39:42.597
I find that my anger
is better channeled

39:42.641 --> 39:44.425
into clothing than combat.

39:44.469 --> 39:46.688
Which I'm sure you'll have
a smartass comment about.

39:46.732 --> 39:48.777
Looks like you have
a lot of anger.

39:49.909 --> 39:51.867
But you don't have to be
angry with me anymore.

39:51.911 --> 39:53.434
You were right.

39:53.478 --> 39:55.480
I was acting like
I knew better than you,

39:55.523 --> 39:57.830
but I was only trying to do
what I thought

39:57.873 --> 39:59.440
was best for my child.

39:59.484 --> 40:01.486
And I didn't realize
that you were just trying

40:01.529 --> 40:02.878
to do the same thing.

40:02.922 --> 40:04.140
We might have different approaches,

40:04.184 --> 40:05.620
but we're family.

40:05.664 --> 40:07.666
Even if we aren't
related by blood.

40:07.709 --> 40:11.278
I'm a Carrington, and I will
always protect the Carringtons.

40:11.321 --> 40:13.498
Even the ones not here yet.

40:13.541 --> 40:16.414
And I'm sorry it took me
so long to see that.

40:16.457 --> 40:17.850
Thank you for stopping me

40:17.893 --> 40:19.373
from doing something stupid
last night.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.157
I'm sure there'll be
plenty of other times.

40:21.201 --> 40:22.463
Agreed.

40:22.507 --> 40:23.943
But there is
something else.

40:23.986 --> 40:26.206
I like that we have
different approaches.

40:26.249 --> 40:29.862
And now that I see
how much you care,

40:29.905 --> 40:32.386
would you consider doing
one more thing for my family?

40:32.430 --> 40:34.432
Of course. What is it?

40:34.475 --> 40:37.783
Liam and I would be honored

40:37.826 --> 40:39.480
if you would be
our baby's godmother.

40:41.264 --> 40:43.876
The baby's <i>madrina?</i>

40:43.919 --> 40:45.660
Of course.

40:45.704 --> 40:47.793
The honor would be all mine.

40:51.318 --> 40:54.843
Okay!
You used me to plant
false information with Blake.

40:54.887 --> 40:56.105
I-I can explain.

40:56.149 --> 40:58.020
You don't have to explain.

40:58.064 --> 40:59.587
I understand all too well.

40:59.631 --> 41:01.284
What, you think
Blake is any better?

41:01.328 --> 41:04.592
Blake might be a bastard,
but he's honest with me

41:04.636 --> 41:05.767
about who he is.

41:05.811 --> 41:08.248
You <i>pretended</i> to want to

41:08.291 --> 41:09.510
have a relationship with me

41:09.554 --> 41:10.946
to get back at him.

41:10.990 --> 41:12.078
I do want a relationship
with you,

41:12.121 --> 41:13.514
and I want to get back at him.

41:13.558 --> 41:16.865
Look, Dom, I saw an opportunity
and I took it.

41:16.909 --> 41:19.259
It doesn't mean we can't get
to know each other as siblings.

41:19.302 --> 41:21.696
That's exactly what it means.

41:21.740 --> 41:23.524
I just came here tonight
to tell you

41:23.568 --> 41:25.483
I never want
to talk to you again.

41:25.526 --> 41:27.876
Dom, wait.

41:34.013 --> 41:35.101
Don't worry,

41:35.144 --> 41:37.320
you don't need her anyway.

41:37.364 --> 41:40.715
This has all the dirt we need
for you to win your court case.

41:42.064 --> 41:43.805
Thank you, Anders,

41:43.849 --> 41:47.592
for your dirty, dirty
little book of secrets.
