00:39.126 --> 00:41.693
Titans!

00:41.737 --> 00:45.045
Are you ready to go
to the Jump City State Fair?

00:48.439 --> 00:52.530
I'm gonna eat so much food
till I explode, baby.

00:52.574 --> 00:56.056
Oh, yeah! Deep-fried
burrito cupcakes heres I come.

00:58.275 --> 01:01.496
I will partake in so many
of the amusements.

01:04.412 --> 01:06.457
Woo-hoo!

01:06.501 --> 01:08.546
It'll be our
biggest adventure yet!

01:09.765 --> 01:11.897
Crime alert?

01:11.941 --> 01:13.725
No, it's a distress call

01:13.769 --> 01:15.814
from the animators
of <i>Teen Titans Go!</i>

01:15.858 --> 01:17.120
Animators?

01:17.164 --> 01:20.384
Please, who are
these "animators"?

01:20.428 --> 01:22.430
Animators are creatures
that look like humans...

01:24.258 --> 01:25.583
...but they fear sunlight
and dress like little children.

01:25.607 --> 01:27.261
They could be classified
into four groups.

01:27.304 --> 01:29.611
Most common is
the toy-collecting animator.

01:29.654 --> 01:32.309
This group is willing to blow
their entire life savings

01:32.353 --> 01:35.095
on overpriced pieces of plastic.

01:35.138 --> 01:38.924
Next is the historian animator,
who's always spouting off facts

01:38.968 --> 01:40.491
about the early days
of animation,

01:40.535 --> 01:42.102
even though
nobody asked them to.

01:43.451 --> 01:44.776
Then there's
the know-it-all animator,

01:44.800 --> 01:46.410
who's got an answer
for everything.

01:46.454 --> 01:48.934
Except for how to get
their own work done on time.

01:48.978 --> 01:51.241
And finally,
the bitter senior animator,

01:51.285 --> 01:52.851
who was once a great leader

01:52.895 --> 01:54.935
but now gets bossed around
by people half their age.

01:56.986 --> 01:59.510
These all sound
like a bunch of nerds, yo. Ow!

01:59.554 --> 02:01.251
Show some respect!

02:01.295 --> 02:04.254
These "nerds" are responsible
for creating our show.

02:04.298 --> 02:06.691
What do these animators want?

02:06.735 --> 02:08.824
They're asking for our help.

02:08.867 --> 02:10.976
They say lately we've
been overwhelming them
with our big adventures,

02:11.000 --> 02:13.133
<i>and if we don't
cut back a little,</i>

02:13.176 --> 02:14.980
<i>then their schedule
will get out of control
and run wild!</i>

02:15.004 --> 02:17.049
<i>It could destroy
our entire show.</i>

02:18.660 --> 02:20.314
Oh, no!

02:20.357 --> 02:22.490
Oh, I'll kick that schedule
in its stupid face, yo.

02:22.533 --> 02:24.666
I'm afraid it's not that easy.

02:28.887 --> 02:30.976
This is not just a schedule,

02:31.020 --> 02:32.848
it's a very aggressive schedule.

02:32.891 --> 02:34.719
That's one mean-looking
schedule, yo.

02:34.763 --> 02:36.286
So what can we do to help?

02:40.769 --> 02:42.336
"Stop lip stink"?

02:42.379 --> 02:43.815
Our lips don't stink.

02:43.859 --> 02:45.208
Robin's lips do.

02:45.252 --> 02:47.036
His whole mouth
smells like tuna fish.

02:47.079 --> 02:49.734
No, not "lip stink," lip sync.

02:49.778 --> 02:52.824
It's the process
of animating our mouths
every time we speak.

02:52.868 --> 02:55.175
Hold up.

02:55.218 --> 02:57.240
You means to tell me
some animator be touching
my mouth every times I speaks?

02:57.264 --> 02:59.179
- Ew, gross.
- Here, put these on.

03:00.876 --> 03:02.704
See, now that our mouths
are covered,

03:02.747 --> 03:05.402
our lip sync is no longer
an issue. Problem solved!

03:05.446 --> 03:07.839
Not really, my lips
are my best feature, yo.

03:07.883 --> 03:09.667
You can't deprive
the world of my lips.

03:09.711 --> 03:11.321
Right, mama?

03:11.365 --> 03:13.845
Too bad
these bars don't shut you up.

03:13.889 --> 03:15.673
I look like
I'm being inappropriate...

03:15.717 --> 03:17.327
<i>♪ Even though I'm not</i>

03:17.371 --> 03:19.068
This is not so bad.

03:19.111 --> 03:21.375
Now let us go to the state fair.

03:26.249 --> 03:28.773
What's up with the elevator, yo?

03:29.992 --> 03:31.515
It seems
the background department

03:31.559 --> 03:33.232
has just requested
that we stick to the tower

03:33.256 --> 03:35.345
so they don't have to draw
any new locations.

03:35.389 --> 03:37.521
Oh, come on, man.
They're demanding stuff, too?

03:37.565 --> 03:40.089
It's cool, we can just chill
and watch some TV.

03:44.746 --> 03:46.051
Yo, what's up with the remote?

03:46.095 --> 03:48.053
It isn't the remote.

03:48.097 --> 03:49.988
It's just that animating
a show within a show
takes a lot of work.

03:50.012 --> 03:51.729
How do they expect us
to entertain ourselves?

03:51.753 --> 03:54.059
I know something exciting
we can do.

03:54.103 --> 03:55.757
I'll give you all
a thrilling lecture

03:55.800 --> 03:57.759
on creating an animation budget.

04:00.414 --> 04:02.285
Now, the first step
to creating a budget

04:02.329 --> 04:04.244
is dividing it
into two categories.

04:04.287 --> 04:06.724
The first category
is above the line

04:06.768 --> 04:08.900
and the second category
is below the line.

04:14.297 --> 04:18.258
Ugh! I do not think
I can take the much more.

04:18.301 --> 04:20.390
Ugh.
Let's get out of here, yo.

04:22.218 --> 04:24.089
Okay, what now?
We're not allowed to walk?

04:24.133 --> 04:25.917
Exactly! Do you know
how long it takes

04:25.961 --> 04:27.397
to animate a person walking?

04:27.441 --> 04:29.399
But whats if I gots to go
to the bathroom?

04:29.443 --> 04:31.271
Well, then you'll
have to go right here.

04:31.314 --> 04:33.011
I ain't gonna pee-pee
on no couch.

04:33.055 --> 04:34.317
That's just nasty!

04:34.361 --> 04:35.405
Ooh, I've got a solution.

04:35.449 --> 04:36.754
I can make us all float.

04:36.798 --> 04:38.321
Azarath Metrion Zinthos!

04:39.670 --> 04:42.194
This ain't no solution, mama.

04:42.238 --> 04:44.762
All this floating around
is making me motion sick.

04:44.806 --> 04:47.156
And all of my blood
is rushing to my brain.

04:47.199 --> 04:50.333
These boots were made
for the walking,
not the floating.

04:50.377 --> 04:53.467
Would you guys
stop complaining?
This is amazing!

04:53.510 --> 04:56.774
I finally have
the ability to fly!

04:56.818 --> 04:59.299
Look at me!
I'm Peter Pan!

05:00.996 --> 05:03.303
Okay, I need some practice.

05:03.346 --> 05:06.480
But this is still amazing!

05:06.523 --> 05:08.003
I'm glad
you're having fun, Robin.

05:08.046 --> 05:10.310
Because we ain't!

05:10.353 --> 05:12.486
Friends, perhaps we could
cheer ourselves up

05:12.529 --> 05:14.618
by enjoying the meal
of the snack.

05:14.662 --> 05:17.534
That sounds way better
than watching Robin
fly around like a dummy.

05:17.578 --> 05:20.711
Wait, Titans, I think
I'm finally getting
the hang of it.

05:26.935 --> 05:28.632
Hey, what happened
to all our food?

05:28.676 --> 05:31.200
Looks like the props department
is a bit behind as well.

05:31.243 --> 05:33.333
They didn't have time
to draw new food for us.

05:33.376 --> 05:35.726
Then what do they expect us
to eat? The air?

05:35.770 --> 05:37.162
Exactly, Beast Boy.

05:37.206 --> 05:38.990
We can just use
our imaginations to eat.

05:39.034 --> 05:40.340
Just watch.

05:40.383 --> 05:43.560
Ooh, look!
Some corn on the cob.

05:45.388 --> 05:47.564
Delicious.
And look...

05:47.608 --> 05:50.001
there's a bowl
of mashed potatoes.

05:50.045 --> 05:51.829
Have you lost your mind, fool?

05:51.873 --> 05:54.484
Not at all.
Come on, give it a try.

05:54.528 --> 05:58.009
Well, if you say so.

05:58.053 --> 06:00.360
Yeah, so good.

06:00.403 --> 06:02.100
See, this isn't so bad.

06:02.144 --> 06:05.408
Here, Raven.
Try some jalapeno nachos.

06:05.452 --> 06:09.717
Mmm, yeah. Spicy, I guess?

06:09.760 --> 06:12.415
And, Starfire,
you are gonna love

06:12.459 --> 06:14.112
this chocolate milkshake!

06:14.156 --> 06:15.940
The slurp, the slurp.

06:15.984 --> 06:18.726
Here's one juicy burger
coming at you, Cyborg.

06:18.769 --> 06:24.122
Right. Sure is juicy.

06:24.166 --> 06:25.602
Oh, take smaller bites, Cyborg.

06:25.646 --> 06:27.561
You don't want to
imaginary choke.

06:29.737 --> 06:32.087
See, we don't need
real food after all.

06:32.130 --> 06:34.785
All we need is
our delicious imaginations.

06:34.829 --> 06:36.134
Isn't this great?

06:36.178 --> 06:39.094
No! It is
the opposite of the great.

06:39.137 --> 06:40.312
This is awful.

06:40.356 --> 06:42.619
Them animators has gones
too far.

06:42.663 --> 06:44.578
Aw! Hey! Take it easy.

06:44.621 --> 06:47.450
We are the done
taking orders from them!

06:47.494 --> 06:49.974
- Argh!
- Argh!

06:50.018 --> 06:52.150

07:16.784 --> 07:18.568
You're going to overwhelm
the artists.

07:18.612 --> 07:20.962
It's cool, brah. They can
just work some overtime.

07:21.005 --> 07:23.094
They're already
working overtime!

07:24.966 --> 07:25.967
What was that?

07:27.490 --> 07:29.449
It's the
very aggressive schedule.

07:30.885 --> 07:31.799
And thanks
to your careless shenanigans,

07:31.842 --> 07:33.453
it's now out of control!

07:33.496 --> 07:35.416
We have to stop it
before it destroys everything.

07:50.208 --> 07:52.210
Let's take that fool down.

07:52.254 --> 07:54.386
Stop! You can't fight
that thing!

07:54.430 --> 07:56.040
Oh, yeah? Watch us.

08:00.567 --> 08:04.484
Ow!

08:06.660 --> 08:08.966
Your fighting is only creating
more work,

08:09.010 --> 08:11.839
which is making
the very aggressive schedule
even more aggressive.

08:14.711 --> 08:16.800
Guys, I think he's right.

08:16.844 --> 08:19.629
Then how do we do
the calming down
of the schedule?

08:19.673 --> 08:20.978
We have to throw money at it!

08:21.022 --> 08:22.719
But we ain't
gots no money, fool.

08:23.546 --> 08:25.200
Then we're doomed.

08:27.942 --> 08:30.597
Ahhh! My tooth
be on the wrong side, yo!

08:32.555 --> 08:35.863
Oh, no! My anchor points
are unregistered!

08:41.564 --> 08:44.088
What's this?

08:46.874 --> 08:48.658
The animators
have just informed me

08:48.702 --> 08:51.661
that we can defeat the schedule
by battling it off-screen.

08:51.705 --> 08:53.533
What is this "off-screen"?

08:53.576 --> 08:55.360
That's off-screen.

08:55.404 --> 08:56.860
But we've never been
over there before.

08:56.884 --> 08:58.886
What if something terrible
happens to us?

08:58.929 --> 09:00.714
That's a risk
we're going to have to take.

09:00.757 --> 09:02.977
Now, come on,
Titans! Attack!

09:06.415 --> 09:09.853
I never knew
being off the screen
could be so liberating.

09:09.897 --> 09:12.203
We can do all sorts
of awesome moves here!

09:12.247 --> 09:15.772
Whoo! I feel sorry
for anyone who's missing out
on this battle!

09:15.816 --> 09:18.079
We're, like, so amazing!

09:18.122 --> 09:21.212
Look,
our off-screen antics
are calming down the schedule,

09:21.256 --> 09:22.816
and the animators
are regaining control.

09:28.176 --> 09:30.091
Nice work, Titans!

09:30.134 --> 09:31.614
We successfully saved the show

09:31.658 --> 09:34.051
from the clutches
of a very aggressive schedule.

09:34.095 --> 09:35.966
Who knew a spreadsheet
could be so terrifying?

09:36.010 --> 09:37.794
Or so dangerous.

09:37.838 --> 09:39.990
Yo, I definitely don't want
to mess with that thing again.

09:40.014 --> 09:43.060
Then let's make a vow
to take it easy on
the animators from now on.

09:43.104 --> 09:44.944
[Beast Boy, Cyborg,
Raven and Starfire] Agreed.

09:50.502 --> 09:52.504
We have to stop
those aliens and dinosaurs

09:52.548 --> 09:54.332
before they obliterate the city.

09:54.376 --> 09:56.726
We're gonna need the help of
every DC superhero out there.

09:56.770 --> 09:58.641
And their sidekicks.

09:58.685 --> 10:02.471
And their super vehicles
with all their many
moving parts!

10:02.514 --> 10:06.127
Oh, yeah. This adventure
is going to be epic.

10:06.170 --> 10:07.345
Titans, go!
