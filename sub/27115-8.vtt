00:02.467 --> 00:03.100
- Previously on

00:03.100 --> 00:03.533
- Previously on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

00:05.100 --> 00:06.233
Don't go anywhere
near there, please.

00:06.266 --> 00:07.300
- Put us to work.
- No, no, no, no.

00:07.333 --> 00:08.567
Don't go anywhere near there.

00:08.600 --> 00:10.500
- Lisa told us
not to come to TomTom.

00:10.533 --> 00:12.033
- I wanna see it.

00:12.066 --> 00:13.333
- There's nothing to see
right now.

00:13.367 --> 00:15.133
It's just a load of stuff
in plastic.

00:19.266 --> 00:21.133
- I'm like, "Sounds like fun."

00:21.166 --> 00:24.200
- I'll go ahead and go home
if it's gonna be about that.

00:24.233 --> 00:27.100
I'm already on the brim
of, like, freaking out.

00:27.133 --> 00:28.266
Like, I keep hearing about,

00:28.300 --> 00:30.100
like, Ariana and Tom
talking about us,

00:30.133 --> 00:31.500
and then Katie and Stassi
asked me about it the other day.

00:31.533 --> 00:34.233
We have to prove that
we're in a great place.

00:34.266 --> 00:35.600
- No, no, no, we don't
have to prove to anybody.

00:35.633 --> 00:38.300
- Well, I'm gonna
take a quick shower.

00:38.333 --> 00:40.300
You're welcome to join me.
- Oh, yeah?

00:40.333 --> 00:41.667
- Thanks for the offer.

00:41.700 --> 00:42.667
- I'll leave the door open,
just in case.

00:42.700 --> 00:44.266
- Yeah.

00:44.300 --> 00:45.533
- I'm trans,
and it's Girls Night.

00:45.567 --> 00:47.300
That's my ----ing pronoun.

00:47.333 --> 00:49.266
- It's got nothing to do
with you being transgender.

00:49.300 --> 00:52.533
I have never heard a word
regarding any issue.

00:54.200 --> 00:56.333
- Girl, you did not include me
in any of this.

00:56.367 --> 00:58.500
- Stop making this about
something that it's not.

00:58.533 --> 01:00.500
...for sure.
- Cis privilege?

01:00.533 --> 01:02.200
(BLEEP) that bitch.

01:05.233 --> 01:08.567
- ♪ You know that
it's your time ♪

01:08.600 --> 01:13.500

of our lives ♪

01:13.533 --> 01:17.433

01:31.533 --> 01:33.667
- How's it going, maestro?

01:33.700 --> 01:36.066
- Good, good, good, good.
- Good.

01:36.100 --> 01:38.333
I cannot catch a break
with anybody.

01:38.367 --> 01:41.133
We don't have any water;
we don't have any electricity;

01:41.166 --> 01:43.667
we don't have any gas;
we don't have a sound system.

01:43.700 --> 01:47.166
And right now,
I feel like...ah!

01:47.200 --> 01:48.700
Even though
the official opening

01:48.734 --> 01:50.600
for TomTom
isn't for a few weeks,

01:50.633 --> 01:54.233
we have committed to
the Daily Mail TV party.

01:54.266 --> 01:55.400
That is around the corner.

01:55.433 --> 01:57.266
So, what are we doing
with this one?

01:57.300 --> 01:59.400
- I was thinking about
the greenery on the walls here.

01:59.433 --> 02:02.233
We gotta get spots in here
to highlight those.

02:02.266 --> 02:03.600
- Yeah, we've gotta do that.

02:03.633 --> 02:05.500
Hopefully we'll have
electricity tomorrow.

02:05.533 --> 02:07.600
We can't let Tom and Tom in.

02:07.633 --> 02:09.533
- No, seriously, I can't.

02:09.567 --> 02:11.467
There's no time to stop and
explain every little thing...

02:11.500 --> 02:13.333
- Right.
- That's happening.

02:13.367 --> 02:15.233
- I want them to see it
when it's finished, damn it,

02:15.266 --> 02:16.667
and it looks bloody amazing.

02:16.700 --> 02:19.500
I want them to come and go,
"We are gobsmacked."

02:19.533 --> 02:21.600
Translation loosely,
overwhelmed?

02:21.633 --> 02:23.467
- And I know that they're
gonna want details and...

02:23.500 --> 02:25.233
- Tomorrow.
We'll do it tomorrow.

02:33.166 --> 02:34.400
- Oh, my God,
there's a permit issue.

02:34.433 --> 02:36.233
I didn't even tell you
about this.

02:36.266 --> 02:37.734
I don't think we can cook any
food in the kitchen right now,

02:37.767 --> 02:40.300
so we're gonna have to use
the kitchen at Pump, I think.

02:40.333 --> 02:41.600
- Well, at least they've
got another restaurant...

02:41.633 --> 02:43.734
- I know, exactly.
- Just two doors down.

02:43.767 --> 02:46.166
- We have the hottest block
literally in West Hollywood.

02:46.200 --> 02:49.133
- I know.

02:49.166 --> 02:51.533
- Oh, probably--oh, sh--.
- Who is it?

02:51.567 --> 02:53.400
- Hey, what's up, Ken?

02:53.433 --> 02:55.233
- Schwartzy, what's happening?

02:55.266 --> 02:57.200
- I'm just getting dressed up.
Excited for the big reveal.

02:57.233 --> 02:58.233
- Hi, Ken.
- Katie says hello.

02:58.266 --> 03:00.600
And, yeah, we're super excited.

03:00.633 --> 03:02.400
- It's your boyfriend.
- Hey.

03:02.433 --> 03:04.433
Sandoval just walked in, so...

03:04.467 --> 03:06.734
- I wanna see our destiny,
our legacy.

03:06.767 --> 03:09.433
- Listen, you guys
don't come here today.

03:09.467 --> 03:10.667
- What?
- What?

03:10.700 --> 03:12.233
- Wait, why?

03:12.266 --> 03:14.300
- Um, why?
Why can't we come today?

03:14.333 --> 03:15.667
- It's too crazy here.

03:15.700 --> 03:18.333
- Man, he flat-ironed his hair.

03:18.367 --> 03:20.367
- Dude, come on.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.400
- Don't want you to panic, but
we don't have any electricity,

03:22.433 --> 03:24.633
we don't have any water,
and we don't have any gas.

03:24.667 --> 03:26.433
I will see you tomorrow.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.400
- Okay, bye, Lisa.

03:29.433 --> 03:31.300
- You guys have both
been talking about

03:31.333 --> 03:32.700
how excited you are, you've
been counting down the days.

03:32.734 --> 03:34.000
Now you're like...
- I know.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.533
It's like your parents telling
you you're going to Disneyland,

03:37.567 --> 03:39.200
and then you wake up,
and they're like,

03:39.233 --> 03:40.233
"Uh, here's, like,
a little Mickey Mouse

03:40.266 --> 03:41.633
Pez dispenser instead,"

03:41.667 --> 03:43.533
but it's empty.

03:43.567 --> 03:46.000
- What should we do? I guess
we should just hang out.

03:46.033 --> 03:49.000
- I was so excited, dude.
I got my outfit ready.

03:49.033 --> 03:50.567
I know we got some work to do,

03:50.600 --> 03:53.333
but I know Scheana's got
her housewarming party today.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.200
- Oh, is that today?
- Yeah.

03:55.233 --> 03:56.400
I can't believe
she moved over there.

03:56.433 --> 03:58.500
Like, Marina del Rey?

03:58.533 --> 04:00.600
- You might as well
move to Jersey.

04:04.433 --> 04:07.367
- Who's driving?
- Jax, you're driving.

04:07.400 --> 04:10.500
- I got road trip snacks.
Babe, will you open my door?

04:10.533 --> 04:12.300
- All right.

04:12.333 --> 04:13.633
- Road trip!

04:13.667 --> 04:15.367
We might as well be going
to ----ing Vegas.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.567
- Dude, we have to go so far.

04:20.600 --> 04:23.200
- How was the Girls Night?
- It was good.

04:23.233 --> 04:25.533
I mean, besides Billie.

04:25.567 --> 04:27.567
I don't know if you guys saw,
like, her tweet and stuff.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.300
Then she started
liking comments

04:30.333 --> 04:33.767
about, like, us not including
her on Girls Night,

04:34.000 --> 04:35.567
and because she's trans,

04:35.600 --> 04:38.400
which is such a slap
in the face.

04:38.433 --> 04:40.500
Billie is insinuating that

04:40.533 --> 04:42.700
us girls are transphobic.

04:42.734 --> 04:45.200
She knows that that's not true.

04:45.233 --> 04:47.367
Like, how you block someone
on your phone,

04:47.400 --> 04:50.300
I've, like, blocked her,
as far as my vision goes,

04:50.333 --> 04:51.467
my ears go.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.333
She's just blocked.

04:53.367 --> 04:56.500
Do we know who's gonna be
at this housewarming party?

04:56.533 --> 04:57.767
- James and Raquel
and Billie...

04:58.000 --> 04:59.600
- Ugh.
- Oh, God.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.033
Tom and Ariana?
- Oh, yeah.

05:01.066 --> 05:02.667
Tom and Ariana will be there.

05:02.700 --> 05:05.233
Stassi and Kristen and Katie
aren't gonna be there.

05:05.266 --> 05:07.367
- They are so lucky.

05:15.767 --> 05:17.467
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

05:17.500 --> 05:20.333
All right, this is one
with the salami, so...

05:20.367 --> 05:23.233
- Oh, my God, this is like an--
- Look how cute.

05:23.266 --> 05:24.667
- This is a Los Angeles salad.

05:26.767 --> 05:30.300
- Thanks for helping
last night's Girls Night In.

05:30.333 --> 05:32.066
It was fun.

05:32.100 --> 05:33.767
- There was a line
down Robertson.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.767
- It was crazy packed.

05:41.533 --> 05:44.266
I obviously could see
you and Billie

05:44.300 --> 05:45.633
having a conversation.

05:45.667 --> 05:47.266
- I don't know if you'd call it
a conversation.

05:47.300 --> 05:49.066
- We were fully prepared

05:49.100 --> 05:51.000
to talk to Billie
in your defense.

05:51.033 --> 05:52.767
- This is not about
her being trans.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
It's about her being an asshole.
- Yeah.

05:55.033 --> 05:57.500
When Scheana invited me,
I said,

05:57.533 --> 05:59.667
"No, I don't wanna be
in any intimate setting

05:59.700 --> 06:01.000
with James and Billie."

06:01.033 --> 06:02.567
- I don't even go
to the West Side

06:02.600 --> 06:04.000
for people that I'm, like,
genuinely friends with.

06:04.033 --> 06:05.500
- If Beau lived
on the West Side,

06:05.533 --> 06:06.533
I would break up with him.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.066
Traffic ----ing sucks.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.667
To get to Marina del Rey,

06:09.700 --> 06:13.000
you have to go south of Sur
for, like, ever and ever,

06:13.033 --> 06:15.000
all the way to the 10-West,

06:15.033 --> 06:18.667
just to fight all the airport
traffic on the 405,

06:18.700 --> 06:21.567
to get to the 90-West,
whatever the hell that is,

06:21.600 --> 06:24.033
past the flight attendants
and divorcees

06:24.066 --> 06:26.400
and old men
with metal detectors,

06:26.433 --> 06:29.667
and this is where Scheana
has chosen to live.

06:29.700 --> 06:32.467
- Geographically undesirable.
- Yes.

06:32.500 --> 06:35.367
- ♪ Forever ♪

06:35.400 --> 06:37.533
♪ Ride on the waves with me ♪

06:42.333 --> 06:43.400
- Hello.
- Hi!

06:43.433 --> 06:46.500
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

06:46.533 --> 06:48.133
This place is amazing.

06:48.166 --> 06:49.667
- Oh, my God, I love it so much.
- Hello!

06:49.700 --> 06:51.400
- Wow.
- How are you?

06:51.433 --> 06:53.100
You look gorgeous.
- It's beautiful.

06:53.133 --> 06:54.567
- It's so cute.
- Thank you.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.467
Hi!
- Look at this.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.033
Scheana finds it very easy
to cut me off.

06:59.066 --> 07:01.400
- I don't feel like
we're close anymore.

07:01.433 --> 07:03.033
I need to stand up for my
girls, and you've hurt them,

07:03.066 --> 07:06.133
and it's just--it's ----ed up.

07:06.166 --> 07:08.500
- She's very flippy-floppy,
wishy-washy.

07:08.533 --> 07:11.400
- This is for you two
and little Graham.

07:11.433 --> 07:12.567
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.033
But you know what
the good thing is

07:14.066 --> 07:15.600
about having
a flippy-floppy friend?

07:15.633 --> 07:18.033
Is that they always come
flipping back to you eventually.

07:18.066 --> 07:22.433
- This is the extra room,
guest room, makeup room.

07:22.467 --> 07:23.600
- Cute!

07:25.467 --> 07:27.600
- Oh, my God, your bedroom.
- And this is my room.

07:27.633 --> 07:30.133
- Wow.
- So dope.

07:30.166 --> 07:31.433
- West Side is best side.

07:31.467 --> 07:33.033
My mom did, like, all of this.

07:33.066 --> 07:36.367
Her and Adam moved me
completely in here.

07:36.400 --> 07:38.100
I get to wake up and look at
----ing boats every day,

07:38.133 --> 07:40.767
and, like, it's worth
the drive and traffic.

07:44.700 --> 07:46.200
- Go!

07:46.233 --> 07:47.667
- Dude,
where the (BLEEP) are we?

07:47.700 --> 07:49.467
- I never go south
of Wilshire.

07:49.500 --> 07:52.467
- Oh, (BLEEP) no,
and I never go east of La Brea.

07:57.433 --> 07:59.133
- No, we're not. Aria--
- 28 minutes.

07:59.166 --> 08:01.033
- 28 minutes?
- What? Dude, I feel like--

08:01.066 --> 08:03.133
I literally feel like we've
been in the car for an hour.

08:03.166 --> 08:04.133
- Remember I told you
we were supposed to go in

08:04.166 --> 08:05.700
to see TomTom today?

08:05.734 --> 08:07.633
I guess they're still
putting up,

08:07.667 --> 08:10.734
like, the decor and the
furniture and all that stuff,

08:10.767 --> 08:13.066
and she doesn't want us
to, like, see it yet,

08:13.100 --> 08:14.767
which, I guess she wants
to, like, reveal it to us.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.367
- We're both gonna cry,
by the way.

08:16.400 --> 08:17.734
That's a given.
- Oh, for sure.

08:17.767 --> 08:19.200
You guys are definitely.
- I won't.

08:19.233 --> 08:21.700
For some reason,
I've been known

08:21.734 --> 08:25.000
to get a little emotional
in the past.

08:25.033 --> 08:28.667
No, babe, I'm just tired
of arguing all the time.

08:28.700 --> 08:32.734
It was so hard for me
to go through this.

08:32.767 --> 08:34.200
I don't wanna see you
like this, man.

08:34.233 --> 08:37.000
You ----ing deserve
better, dude.

08:40.233 --> 08:42.100
Yes, I'm gonna be touched,
but I'm not gonna cry.

08:42.133 --> 08:44.500
- If you don't cry, I will
write you a check for $500.

08:44.533 --> 08:45.533
- Really?
- Yes.

08:45.567 --> 08:48.000
- I will match that.

08:48.033 --> 08:49.700
- Coming up...

08:49.734 --> 08:51.066
- You're not ----ing better
than me, Lala! You got that?

08:51.100 --> 08:52.600
You're not better than everyone

08:52.633 --> 08:54.133
just because you have
a ----ing rich boyfriend.

08:54.166 --> 08:56.400
- You're being
a ----ing psychopath.

09:03.000 --> 09:03.533
- ♪ Everything seems

09:03.533 --> 09:04.000
- ♪ Everything seems
brand new ♪

09:05.300 --> 09:07.700
♪ The way that we are, yeah ♪

09:07.734 --> 09:09.500
- Hey!
all: Hi!

09:09.533 --> 09:11.700
What's up, guys?

09:11.734 --> 09:14.100
- Hi!

09:14.133 --> 09:16.533
Thanks for coming
to the West Side.

09:16.567 --> 09:17.767
Welcome.
- Congratulations.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
- Thanks.

09:19.033 --> 09:20.667
- Going to Marina del Rey,

09:20.700 --> 09:23.567
it's like over the hill
and back again, Hobbit style.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.100
It's a trek.

09:25.133 --> 09:28.033
Dude, we got our, um,
birthday coming up.

09:28.066 --> 09:30.166
- I know, that's what I really
wanted to talk to you...

09:30.200 --> 09:32.200
- So, let's get
that place packed

09:32.233 --> 09:35.300
with sexy '70s
roller disco people.

09:35.333 --> 09:36.567
- Is there anybody
who you don't want there?

09:36.600 --> 09:37.667
Let's put that out there first.

09:37.700 --> 09:39.600
- No, I think everybody.

09:42.233 --> 09:44.066
- What up?

09:47.266 --> 09:48.667
Yeah, and, you know,

09:48.700 --> 09:50.600
thanks for not dis-including
me on that one.

09:50.633 --> 09:52.567
- Since our birthdays
are kinda close,

09:52.600 --> 09:54.266
his is the 7th
and mine is the 11th,

09:54.300 --> 09:55.734
Tom and I decided to throw

09:55.767 --> 09:58.133
a joint roller skating
birthday party.

09:58.166 --> 10:00.600
Unfortunately,
he's friends with James,

10:00.633 --> 10:02.600
and so I guess I gotta deal
with that little elf on a shelf

10:02.633 --> 10:03.734
for another night.

10:06.767 --> 10:08.700
- This is the Scheana room.

10:08.734 --> 10:11.300
- What, did she rob
a LensCrafters

10:11.333 --> 10:13.734
with her, like,
little things right here?

10:13.767 --> 10:15.700
- No, not Scheana.
- Nope.

10:15.734 --> 10:17.533
What's up, dude?

10:17.567 --> 10:20.066
- Had a good studio session
the other day with Tom.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.233
We missed you there.

10:21.266 --> 10:22.533
- Well, I felt like
if I were to come,

10:22.567 --> 10:24.667
what I said to you
and my actions

10:24.700 --> 10:26.767
would've been not adding up.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.133
My friendship with James
back in the day,

10:29.166 --> 10:31.667
we will never be back
to that place.

10:31.700 --> 10:34.033
- I just want things to be,
like, good, you know?

10:34.066 --> 10:36.133
- I do believe,
if he makes serious changes,

10:36.166 --> 10:39.233
that we could rekindle
somewhat of a friendship.

10:39.266 --> 10:41.233
- Like, you know, I wanna, like,
apologize to Randall as well.

10:41.266 --> 10:42.700
Like, I do wanna--
how should I do that?

10:42.734 --> 10:44.734
Like, should I write
a letter or something?

10:44.767 --> 10:46.233
- I'm not gonna tell you
how to apologize.

10:46.266 --> 10:48.233
That has to be something
that you really mean.

10:48.266 --> 10:51.100
- You have cute little
outdoor furniture and stuff?

10:51.133 --> 10:53.667
- Yeah, my mom did all of this.
- Last time I saw you

10:53.700 --> 10:55.233
was when you were really,
really stressed and kind of...

10:55.266 --> 10:57.600
- Yeah, it's a lot going on.

10:57.633 --> 10:59.100
And then, like,
I feel like I take

10:59.133 --> 11:00.633
such little, tiny things,

11:00.667 --> 11:02.100
and I think about them
and think about them

11:02.133 --> 11:03.266
and think about them.

11:03.300 --> 11:04.767
- If there's, like,
lingering stuff,

11:05.000 --> 11:06.700
like, don't feel like
you have to hold it in.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.567
- I know, that's something that
I get worried about, though,

11:08.600 --> 11:10.133
'cause I'm like, "If I, like,
get upset or something,

11:10.166 --> 11:11.633
"is everybody gonna be like,

11:11.667 --> 11:13.166
'There must be
something going on'"?

11:13.200 --> 11:15.100
- But Katie was saying that,
when she was like,

11:15.133 --> 11:17.633
"Well, maybe there's more to it
and why Brittany's so upset.

11:17.667 --> 11:19.166
"Like, maybe she's realizing,

11:19.200 --> 11:20.667
'Like, oh, sh--,
I'm marrying Jax.'"

11:20.700 --> 11:22.633
Like, along those lines.
- Oh, whatever, Scheana.

11:22.667 --> 11:24.133
I'm never gonna act
like it was perfect.

11:24.166 --> 11:26.266
Our relationship has been sh--.

11:26.300 --> 11:28.133
- I don't wanna just
keep being that person:

11:28.166 --> 11:29.633
"You should go to therapy.
You should go to therapy."

11:29.667 --> 11:31.266
- We are going
to go to therapy.

11:31.300 --> 11:33.600
We have to do the therapy
to prepare us for marriage,

11:33.633 --> 11:36.100
to talk about things, 'cause
something might trigger me,

11:36.133 --> 11:37.667
but we're also the happiest
that we've ever been.

11:37.700 --> 11:39.233
- Well, I know you guys
were doing a lot of work

11:39.266 --> 11:40.667
on your relationship...
- Yeah.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.066
- And then I know that

11:42.100 --> 11:43.667
everything happened
with Jax's dad.

11:43.700 --> 11:45.000
- I just wish people would
just let us be happy,

11:45.033 --> 11:46.166
and they'd just be quiet.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.667
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:47.700 --> 11:49.734
- At the end of the day,
it's my decision.

11:49.767 --> 11:53.700
- Will you please make me
the happiest man in the world

11:53.734 --> 11:55.200
and be my wife?

11:55.233 --> 11:56.700
- Yes!

11:58.333 --> 12:00.166
I know he's not going
to cheat on me again

12:00.200 --> 12:02.166
or I wouldn't have agreed
to marry him.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.433
We are stronger
than we've ever been.

12:03.467 --> 12:05.033
Like, it's starting
to get annoying.

12:05.066 --> 12:06.200
- You just now saying, like,

12:06.233 --> 12:07.667
"We are gonna go
to couples therapy."

12:07.700 --> 12:09.133
I think that's so amazing
for you guys to do.

12:09.166 --> 12:10.367
- Yeah.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.033
- You need to start
making friends

12:12.066 --> 12:13.767
with some of these boat owners.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.166
- Everyone's been so nice.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.600
Yesterday,
like, and last night,

12:16.633 --> 12:17.600
everyone just had
parties out here.

12:17.633 --> 12:19.300
Like, Adam stayed over,

12:19.333 --> 12:21.033
and then he grabbed my face
and we started making out,

12:21.066 --> 12:23.200
and then I was on top of him,
and then ha!

12:24.734 --> 12:26.300
- How was it
most importantly?

12:26.333 --> 12:28.233
- Details, details.

12:28.266 --> 12:30.200
- I think we were both,
like, shook.

12:30.233 --> 12:33.066
I don't wanna be in
a relationship with Adam.

12:33.100 --> 12:35.100
I can say, fully truthful now,

12:35.133 --> 12:37.367
that I did rush into
a relationship with Rob.

12:37.400 --> 12:39.467
I did not process the divorce.

12:39.500 --> 12:41.266
I don't want to do that again,

12:41.300 --> 12:43.400
so Adam is not my boyfriend.

12:43.433 --> 12:45.233
He's my best friend.

12:45.266 --> 12:47.266
- I think he's a little bit
more than your best friend.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.433
- This is like the
"Human Centipede" of love.

12:49.467 --> 12:50.700
- What are we doing
right now, dude?

12:50.734 --> 12:54.033
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no!

12:54.066 --> 12:55.633
- I'm happy that
you came today,

12:55.667 --> 12:57.367
and didn't, like, not come,
like the other girls.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.700
Probably I'm part of the reason
why they didn't.

12:59.734 --> 13:01.433
- I think they have
other reasons.

13:01.467 --> 13:03.233
- What was that?

13:03.266 --> 13:05.200
- Your friend, Billie, dude.
I don't know what her deal is.

13:05.233 --> 13:08.734
She threw it out there
that we're, like, transphobic.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.734
Like, we don't like
the trans community,

13:10.767 --> 13:14.133
because we didn't tag her
on a flier on Instagram.

13:14.166 --> 13:15.300
- She doesn't feel like
she said that at all,

13:15.333 --> 13:16.734
so it's like, she feels like

13:16.767 --> 13:18.700
you're putting words
in her mouth.

13:18.734 --> 13:20.033
- She's trying to say
she didn't know?

13:20.066 --> 13:22.367
No, she knows
she done ----ed up.

13:22.400 --> 13:25.233
- Hey, guys.
- Sounds good--hey...

13:25.266 --> 13:26.667
- I brought shots in here.
- Thank you for the gesture.

13:26.700 --> 13:28.100
- Can I sit right here
for a second?

13:28.133 --> 13:29.233
- Yeah.

13:32.300 --> 13:34.000
- What's up, guys?

13:34.033 --> 13:35.233
- I'm gonna go
in the other room

13:35.266 --> 13:36.767
and give these shots to Tom.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.667
I'm way too sober to be
in the middle of this.

13:38.700 --> 13:41.500
- Did you come in here
to talk to me or...

13:41.533 --> 13:43.367
- Yeah, it's a Girls Night
at my work.

13:43.400 --> 13:45.300
I was, like, extremely upset,
obviously.

13:45.333 --> 13:47.367
My whole life, I was not
included in girl things.

13:47.400 --> 13:50.734
And just to find out that
my job is having something,

13:50.767 --> 13:52.066
and a Girls Night,

13:52.100 --> 13:54.166
it just was a huge trigger
for me.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.333
- There were a lot of people
that were not included

13:56.367 --> 13:57.333
in that flier.

13:57.367 --> 13:59.433
This is so trivial.

13:59.467 --> 14:01.266
The fact that
you put it out there

14:01.300 --> 14:02.500
that people are transphobic
when we said--

14:02.533 --> 14:04.266
- I never the said
the word "transphobic."

14:04.300 --> 14:06.000
- Okay, don't beat around
the bush with me.

14:06.033 --> 14:07.200
- Hold on...
- I'm not a dummy. Just stop.

14:07.233 --> 14:09.100
- I never said the word
"transphobic."

14:09.133 --> 14:10.700
- You also didn't squash it.
You basically agreed with them.

14:10.734 --> 14:12.400
- Tons of people wrote stuff.

14:12.433 --> 14:14.500
You know what the first comment
I saw when you guys posted it?

14:14.533 --> 14:16.200
"Why is Billie Lee
not involved?

14:16.233 --> 14:17.467
Is she not a real girl?"

14:17.500 --> 14:19.300
That hurt me.
- We didn't say that.

14:19.333 --> 14:20.467
- I didn't say "transphobia,"

14:20.500 --> 14:22.100
but you guys are
putting that on me.

14:22.133 --> 14:23.400
- I call a spade a spade.

14:23.433 --> 14:24.400
- No, you're coming from
a cis point-of-view...

14:24.433 --> 14:25.734
- You were obsessed...

14:25.767 --> 14:27.233
- I'm coming from
a trans experience.

14:27.266 --> 14:28.300
- And that is it for me.
You're dismissed.

14:28.333 --> 14:30.166
- Oh, so, "You're dismissed"?

14:30.200 --> 14:31.433
You're not ----ing better
than me, Lala. You got that?

14:31.467 --> 14:33.200
You're not better than everyone

14:33.233 --> 14:35.033
just because you have
a ----ing rich boyfriend.

14:35.066 --> 14:36.433
- You're pathetic.
- Your ----ing privileged ass.

14:36.467 --> 14:38.367
Stop calling me pathetic, bitch.
- You're pathetic.

14:38.400 --> 14:40.166
The fact that you just
took that to my man, Billie,

14:40.200 --> 14:42.100
you're a ----ing lowdown ho.

14:42.133 --> 14:43.533
You were not excluded
on purpose.

14:43.567 --> 14:45.567
That was so ----ed up
of you to do.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.467
You put it on social media,
and now it's...

14:47.500 --> 14:50.166
- It's all on social media.
Every tab was on social media.

14:50.200 --> 14:53.533
- Jesus, I need
a chill day, man.

14:53.567 --> 14:56.133
- You're being
a ---- ing psychopath.

14:56.166 --> 14:59.233
I completely understand
that I will never know

14:59.266 --> 15:01.300
the struggles that
Billie has gone through.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.400
But you mention my man,

15:03.433 --> 15:05.200
she's dead six-feet deep.

15:05.233 --> 15:06.500
You are a catty bitch.

15:06.533 --> 15:08.166
That's why people
don't (BLEEP) with you,

15:08.200 --> 15:09.533
'cause you showed your asshole.
- No, no.

15:09.567 --> 15:12.166
You are constantly talking
sh-- about people.

15:12.200 --> 15:13.500
- It's not about other people!
It's about you.

15:13.533 --> 15:15.333
Stop flipping the script.

15:15.367 --> 15:17.200
You're lowdown. You're dirty.

15:17.233 --> 15:21.133
- Okay, well,
I would love a Jell-O shot.

15:21.166 --> 15:23.200
Nobody intentionally
excluded her,

15:23.233 --> 15:27.333
but you can't say you're
an ally to a transwoman,

15:27.367 --> 15:29.200
and then speak over her

15:29.233 --> 15:31.767
every time she tries to explain
to you how she feels.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.533
- It really hurt, and
I couldn't even get that out

15:34.567 --> 15:37.033
with her because she instantly
is slamming me

15:37.066 --> 15:38.433
for my own feelings.

15:38.467 --> 15:40.533
- Who the (BLEEP)
does she think she is?

15:40.567 --> 15:43.066
It took everything inside me
to not, like,

15:43.100 --> 15:45.066
have my trailer park girl
come out

15:45.100 --> 15:48.066
and slap the sh-- out of her.

15:48.100 --> 15:50.200
- I feel like
bringing social media

15:50.233 --> 15:52.533
into everything that happened
over the last couple of days...

15:52.567 --> 15:54.133
- Yeah.

15:54.166 --> 15:55.567
- Is something that
has made everything,

15:55.600 --> 15:57.467
like, so much bigger.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.066
- That is my one regret,

15:59.100 --> 16:00.500
is, like, having it be
on social media.

16:00.533 --> 16:03.600
- Next time, type out a draft,
and then delete it.

16:03.633 --> 16:06.066
That's what I need to do, yeah.

16:06.100 --> 16:07.433
- Coming up...

16:07.467 --> 16:09.200
Close your eyes. Ready?

16:09.233 --> 16:10.367
- I'm closing my eyes,
I'm closing my eyes.

16:10.400 --> 16:14.500
- Now open them.
- One, two, three.

16:14.533 --> 16:16.500
-  Oh...

16:28.567 --> 16:31.033
- Hi.

16:31.066 --> 16:32.266
- Hi.

16:35.266 --> 16:37.500
We haven't really talked
about what exactly you need.

16:37.533 --> 16:39.333
Do you wanna talk about that?
- Okay, so, um...

16:39.367 --> 16:41.166
- This is just, like, for
getting back into acting?

16:41.200 --> 16:42.633
- Acting.

16:42.667 --> 16:45.333
Yeah, so, last week, I met
with my old theatrical manager,

16:45.367 --> 16:47.367
and signed back with him...
- Okay, great.

16:47.400 --> 16:50.200
- And then he just, like,
needs headshots ASAP

16:50.233 --> 16:52.166
to put back up
on Actors Access.

16:52.200 --> 16:53.533
My friend, Lala,

16:53.567 --> 16:54.633
she's been just, like,
killing it right now.

16:54.667 --> 16:56.567
She's doing so many things.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.700
So, that kind of just sparked
the acting bug for me again.

16:59.734 --> 17:01.300
- I mean, we definitely
wanna get you the headshots

17:01.333 --> 17:02.700
set up, like,
as quickly as possible.

17:02.734 --> 17:04.600
- Yeah.

17:04.633 --> 17:07.567
I've done a lot of comedic
stuff with acting in the past,

17:07.600 --> 17:11.100
and as much as that's where
I feel most comfortable,

17:11.133 --> 17:13.300
I do wanna start to challenge
myself a little more.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.667
I mean, something
where I'm getting, like,

17:14.700 --> 17:17.100
chased and murdered
would be really fun.

17:17.133 --> 17:18.467
Adam had to work,
so he's running a little late,

17:18.500 --> 17:21.166
but he can help with, um,
whatever you need.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.667
I don't know if you need help
with, like, whatever.

17:22.700 --> 17:24.500
- Holding sh--.

17:24.533 --> 17:26.633
What happened the other night?

17:26.667 --> 17:28.233
- I told two people.
- What happened?

17:28.266 --> 17:30.500
- We...did it...
- And?

17:30.533 --> 17:32.467
- And again and again
and again and again.

17:34.266 --> 17:35.667
- What happens now?
- Um, nothing.

17:35.700 --> 17:37.333
I mean, we'll probably
keep having sex,

17:37.367 --> 17:39.166
'cause it's really good.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.600
I've been single
for almost a year now,

17:40.633 --> 17:42.433
and I wanna stay single.

17:42.467 --> 17:44.667
Adam and I, like,
anytime we do a dinner

17:44.700 --> 17:46.467
or a movie or something,

17:46.500 --> 17:48.667
it's always just, like,
a casual friends thing.

17:48.700 --> 17:50.467
- Oh, hey.

17:50.500 --> 17:53.300
- Right as I'm about to get
naked, you walk on in.

17:53.333 --> 17:54.600
I don't put
my lashes on for him,

17:54.633 --> 17:56.200
'cause we're not dating.

17:56.233 --> 17:57.633
- Just, like, kneel down,

17:57.667 --> 17:59.333
and just put your face
in front of it for a second.

17:59.367 --> 18:01.633
- That's what he said.

18:01.667 --> 18:03.333
- That was good.

18:05.333 --> 18:08.333
- So, you didn't have, like,
secret feelings for Adam

18:08.367 --> 18:11.367
while you were dating Rob?

18:11.400 --> 18:13.333
- See, if I say this,

18:13.367 --> 18:15.500
then I look like the girl
who was with Shay,

18:15.533 --> 18:19.367
thinking about Rob, and with
Rob, thinking about Adam.

18:19.400 --> 18:21.400
So, Lala and I, we did,
like, a two-on-one,

18:21.433 --> 18:23.633
just more of, like,
a private coaching thing,

18:23.667 --> 18:25.367
and she had us do, like,

18:25.400 --> 18:27.567
a "When Harry Met Sally"
at the lunch table,

18:27.600 --> 18:29.233
have an orgasm,

18:29.266 --> 18:32.400
so her and I had orgasms
with each other.

18:35.734 --> 18:38.467
Oh, yeah.
Oh, right there.

18:38.500 --> 18:41.367
- So, you practiced
faking orgasms?

18:41.400 --> 18:43.667
- Well, that's
all I used to do.

18:43.700 --> 18:45.400
- Is that what you still do?

18:45.433 --> 18:46.734
- No.

18:46.767 --> 18:50.233
Maybe you just hit
the right spot.

18:50.266 --> 18:51.533
I need to stay single,

18:51.567 --> 18:54.000
and I'm not going
to entertain that.

18:54.033 --> 18:56.533
Single Scheana summer.

18:59.367 --> 19:00.600
- Gorgeous.

19:04.367 --> 19:07.433
- Are you gonna be lost
without me tonight?

19:07.467 --> 19:10.400
- I think we can definitely
use a night apart.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.700
- Here we go, man.
Here we go, here we go.

19:18.734 --> 19:20.567
- I kinda almost don't want to.

19:20.600 --> 19:22.266
- Should we turn back?

19:22.300 --> 19:23.633
- Should we call her
just to make sure

19:23.667 --> 19:25.333
that, like, she's ready for us?

19:25.367 --> 19:27.700
I've always wanted to be
part-owner of a bar,

19:27.734 --> 19:29.533
and not only is it happening,

19:29.567 --> 19:32.533
it's happening with Ken Todd
and Lisa Vanderpump.

19:32.567 --> 19:34.300
- We're here.
We're walking up.

19:34.333 --> 19:35.600
- We just wanna make sure
you're ready for us.

19:35.633 --> 19:37.367
- Okay, I'll come
and meet you outside.

19:37.400 --> 19:40.400
- I'm ready.
I'm ready for this.

19:40.433 --> 19:42.433
- I can't wait.

19:44.233 --> 19:45.700
- Hey.
- Hey!

19:45.734 --> 19:47.300
- Come here.
You look gorgeous.

19:47.333 --> 19:49.233
- I'm a little sweaty.

19:49.266 --> 19:51.734
- Okay, you've gotta take
these off and put this on.

19:51.767 --> 19:54.734
- I've worked for over a decade
as a bartender,

19:54.767 --> 19:57.567
really, always trying
to go the extra mile.

19:57.600 --> 20:00.433
- We got your vase.
- I know, finally.

20:00.467 --> 20:03.500
- TomTom's been
two years in the making.

20:03.533 --> 20:05.734
- A bar always needs a place,

20:06.000 --> 20:08.767
and we were thinking
of calling it TomTom.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.333
- Wow, dude.

20:14.433 --> 20:16.000
Welcome to TomTom.

20:16.033 --> 20:17.567
- Close your eyes. Ready?

20:17.600 --> 20:19.467
- I'm closing my eyes,
I'm closing my eyes.

20:19.500 --> 20:20.567
- Now open them. Open them.
- Ready, Schwartz? On three.

20:20.600 --> 20:21.600
On three...
- All right.

20:21.633 --> 20:24.600
- One, two, three.

20:24.633 --> 20:27.734
-  Oh...

20:27.767 --> 20:30.400
Oh, my God.

20:32.633 --> 20:34.433
This is a masterpiece.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.333
- Oh, my God, Lisa!

20:39.467 --> 20:41.367
- This is unbelievable.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.734
It's the sexiest place
I've ever seen in my life.

20:43.767 --> 20:46.066
I bow down.
- Fellas, you like it?

20:46.100 --> 20:47.500
- Oh, my God.
- Dude.

20:47.533 --> 20:50.367
- Oh, my God,
this is amazing. Amazing.

20:50.400 --> 20:53.567
Opening up this bar,
it's like a dream come true.

20:53.600 --> 20:56.734
Oh, my God, Lisa!

20:56.767 --> 20:58.467
- What the (BLEEP)!

20:58.500 --> 21:00.667
- Yes!
- Don't you love it?

21:00.700 --> 21:03.266
- It's just so awesome to see

21:03.300 --> 21:05.633
that it's paid off.

21:05.667 --> 21:07.734
I'm really excited, Lisa,
and I really appreciate this,

21:07.767 --> 21:09.700
and I'll never forget it
for the rest of my life.

21:09.734 --> 21:11.567
This moment, coming in here...
- Yeah.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.700
This is up there
with my wedding.

21:13.734 --> 21:15.767
- I love you, and I thank you
for everything.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.567
- And everything
you've done for us.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.100
Honestly, you've been, like...

21:19.133 --> 21:21.033
- You're gonna make me cry.
Stop. Stop.

21:21.066 --> 21:22.533
- I'm sorry, it's just, I'm
a little overwhelmed right now.

21:22.567 --> 21:24.400
- But no, seriously,
you've changed our lives,

21:24.433 --> 21:26.033
and you've presented us with a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,

21:26.066 --> 21:27.467
and we're really grateful.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.333
I know we act like idiots
a lot of the time,

21:29.367 --> 21:30.667
but we are grateful.
- Most of the time.

21:30.700 --> 21:32.567
But let's make it
a great success, right?

21:32.600 --> 21:34.533
Let's have fun doing it...
- Yeah. Yeah.

21:34.567 --> 21:36.567
- And then you see
maybe that you'll--

21:36.600 --> 21:38.567
you'll have loads of them.

21:38.600 --> 21:40.367
- Thank you, Lisa, for real.
Thank you.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.367
Please. Please. Thank you.
- No.

21:43.400 --> 21:44.600
Coming up...
- James showed up.

21:44.633 --> 21:46.400
He hasn't changed a bit, man.

21:46.433 --> 21:47.700
- What do you mean?
Tell me everything.

21:47.734 --> 21:49.533
- You should probably
tell him not to discuss

21:49.567 --> 21:53.066
your sexual history either in
front of all of us today even.

21:57.667 --> 21:58.400
- ♪ It's about to go off ♪

21:59.667 --> 22:01.767
♪ Like a firework ♪

22:02.000 --> 22:05.400
♪ Off like a firework ♪

22:05.433 --> 22:06.567
- ♪ Happy birthday ♪

22:06.600 --> 22:08.400
- ♪ It's your birthday ♪

22:08.433 --> 22:09.734
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, how are you doing?

22:09.767 --> 22:11.133
both: Hello.
- How's it going?

22:11.166 --> 22:12.767
- Good.
- It's his birthday.

22:13.000 --> 22:13.767
both: Happy birthday.
- It's my birthday.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.467
Thank you, thank you.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.767
- You'll have to do
a blowjob shot later.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.467
- Bring it, let's do it.
- I'll do one.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.066
- Yeah, let's do a blowjob shot.
- Thank you.

22:20.100 --> 22:22.500
- I actually invited James
to come up here for later,

22:22.533 --> 22:24.367
when we go down
to the cigar bar.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.066
You know, I know
James loves cigars, so...

22:26.100 --> 22:29.066
- Awesome.

22:29.100 --> 22:31.767
- By the way, we went and saw
the big reveal yesterday

22:32.000 --> 22:33.066
over at TomTom.

22:33.100 --> 22:35.467
Dude, it's so goddamn sexy.

22:35.500 --> 22:37.367
- Is it?
- They killed it.

22:37.400 --> 22:39.500
- I got a little emotional.
- I'm not surprised.

22:39.533 --> 22:40.633
- Okay, guys.
- Blowjob shots--

22:40.667 --> 22:42.066
- Oh! Oh!
- No hands.

22:42.100 --> 22:43.600
- Okay, you know,
traditionally,

22:43.633 --> 22:44.734
you have to put your hands
behind your back.

22:44.767 --> 22:46.500
- No hands.
- Oh, my God.

22:46.533 --> 22:48.033
- That was perfect.
- That was impressive.

22:48.066 --> 22:49.700
That's the best one
I've ever seen.

22:49.734 --> 22:51.600
- Ariana's such a lucky girl.
- She is a lucky girl.

22:55.433 --> 22:56.700
- What is that?
- Yeah.

22:59.500 --> 23:01.533
Take it down, dude.
Take it down.

23:01.567 --> 23:03.633
- Oh, my God!

23:03.667 --> 23:06.533
- To be frank,
I'm kinda blown away

23:06.567 --> 23:09.633
how good the rest of the guys
are at taking blowjob shots.

23:09.667 --> 23:11.100
Not their first BJ.

23:17.667 --> 23:20.000
- I feel like I'm with
Hooters royalty.

23:20.033 --> 23:21.700
- Memories!

23:21.734 --> 23:23.767
- I just felt like
I have to get some merch.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.500
Jax will love it.

23:25.533 --> 23:27.133
- That's a cute one.
- I know.

23:27.166 --> 23:29.500
As soon as he found out
that I was a Hooters girl,

23:29.533 --> 23:31.200
I think he decided that
he was gonna marry me.

23:31.233 --> 23:33.100
- Oh, my God.

23:33.133 --> 23:35.000
- I'm not a big believer
in fate,

23:35.033 --> 23:36.467
but you ending up with a girl
that works at Hooters

23:36.500 --> 23:38.533
is starting to make me
rethink things.

23:38.567 --> 23:40.734
- Uh-oh!
- There she is.

23:40.767 --> 23:42.700
- I feel like before we know,
it's gonna be the wedding,

23:42.734 --> 23:45.433
and we're gonna be,
like, real-life married.

23:45.467 --> 23:47.233
- And then it's, like, forever.

23:47.266 --> 23:49.000
- Can't wait to start
the family.

23:49.033 --> 23:50.266
Like, and that's just something
that I've always been

23:50.300 --> 23:51.633
so excited about.

23:51.667 --> 23:53.166
Jax is like,
"As soon as we get married,

23:53.200 --> 23:55.133
we're gonna start,"
'cause he's gonna be 40.

23:55.166 --> 23:56.533
- As soon as we get married,
we're gonna start right away.

23:56.567 --> 23:58.500
- Really?
- I'm 39.

23:58.533 --> 24:00.433
I can't wait too much longer,
because I don't wanna be--

24:00.467 --> 24:02.133
kid's in high school, I'm gonna
be, like, 60 years old.

24:02.166 --> 24:04.266
- When is mini-Tom
gonna pop out?

24:04.300 --> 24:05.734
- I'm calling it,
you heard it first.

24:05.767 --> 24:08.133
I'm having two kids.
- For me, most, two.

24:08.166 --> 24:10.533
Brittany wants three,
but I said two.

24:10.567 --> 24:12.066
- We want three kids.

24:12.100 --> 24:13.433
- Jax should be cursed
with daughters.

24:13.467 --> 24:15.133
- Like, I would
probably get pregnant

24:15.166 --> 24:16.567
with, like, triplet girls.
- That would be his karma.

24:16.600 --> 24:18.200
- And they'll all
be really hot,

24:18.233 --> 24:19.667
just because he's gonna have
to worry about, like, boys.

24:19.700 --> 24:21.033
- And he'll be like, "Why?"

24:21.066 --> 24:22.166
- I predicted that
Jax is gonna have

24:22.200 --> 24:24.166
two of the hottest
daughters ever.

24:24.200 --> 24:27.533
- God's gonna be
laughing his ass off.

24:27.567 --> 24:30.033
We're all sitting here ----ing
talking about having kids.

24:30.066 --> 24:32.033
I never thought
this would happen.

24:32.066 --> 24:34.000
- Is Ariana still very anti?

24:34.033 --> 24:36.600
- I think that Ariana
has to come to it

24:36.633 --> 24:37.734
in her own terms.

24:37.767 --> 24:39.100
- You don't ever
want kids, right?

24:39.133 --> 24:41.033
- I don't wanna give birth.

24:41.066 --> 24:43.767
- She has a phobia of being
pregnant and giving birth.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.700
- She's a woman.
She doesn't have much time.

24:46.734 --> 24:48.633
- Would you ever think of,
like, adoption or anything?

24:48.667 --> 24:51.166
Since you don't wanna have a--
like go through childbirth?

24:51.200 --> 24:53.633
- I think she would
be willing to adopt.

24:53.667 --> 24:55.033
- I would need to feel like

24:55.066 --> 24:56.600
I did all the things
I wanted to do,

24:56.633 --> 24:58.600
and then I could move on
to the next thing.

24:58.633 --> 25:00.066
- Yeah. Oh, yeah,
I understand that.

25:00.100 --> 25:01.667
- Before I would
even be comfortable

25:01.700 --> 25:04.500
considering the idea
of having kids,

25:04.533 --> 25:07.500
I would need to...

25:07.533 --> 25:09.734
check off all the places
I wanna go in the world,

25:09.767 --> 25:11.767
which is kind of all of them,

25:12.000 --> 25:13.734
and I would also just, like,

25:13.767 --> 25:16.066
I don't know, want to?

25:16.100 --> 25:17.600
- Does Tom want kids?

25:17.633 --> 25:19.667
- I think he's more of like,
"Whatever you want,"

25:19.700 --> 25:21.767
which I feel like is how it
needs to be, you know?

25:22.000 --> 25:23.767
- Yeah, of course, of course.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.700
- Is that a deal-breaker
for you?

25:25.734 --> 25:29.200
- It is a deal-breaker
for me with Ariana.

25:29.233 --> 25:30.633
When it comes to kids,

25:30.667 --> 25:32.200
I feel like
I definitely wanna have

25:32.233 --> 25:34.233
at least one or two
at some point in time,

25:34.266 --> 25:38.066
and to not have that option...

25:38.100 --> 25:40.233
is--is a deal-breaker for me.

25:40.266 --> 25:41.734
- Do you think you should
have this discussion

25:41.767 --> 25:43.767
sooner than later with her?

25:44.000 --> 25:45.333
- I'm not ready.

25:45.367 --> 25:46.767
- I only ask this because
you're wasting time.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.033
That's the only thing
I'm asking.

25:50.066 --> 25:52.066
- I wanna buy a house first.

25:52.100 --> 25:54.533
Then, like, maybe we'll talk
about possibly getting married.

25:54.567 --> 25:57.133
- But what if you do
all these things,

25:57.166 --> 25:59.033
and she says no?

25:59.066 --> 26:00.333
You've already got
five years in with this chick.

26:00.367 --> 26:02.233
We don't date anymore for fun.

26:02.266 --> 26:04.166
We date because, "Well, is this
gonna be my life partner?"

26:04.200 --> 26:06.600
Just make sure it makes sense,
'cause from the looks of it,

26:06.633 --> 26:08.633
you both want
two different things.

26:08.667 --> 26:10.100
- All righty,
Lisa took care of it,

26:10.133 --> 26:11.367
so you guys are all set.

26:11.400 --> 26:12.367
Happy birthday.
- Lisa Vanderpump?

26:12.400 --> 26:14.100
- Yeah.
- What?

26:14.133 --> 26:16.700
- How did she know I was here?
- I told her.

26:16.734 --> 26:18.166
We're gonna go to Tom
Sandoval's birthday tomorrow.

26:18.200 --> 26:20.066
It's gonna be
full of debauchery,

26:20.100 --> 26:21.633
maybe a couple
of blowjob shots,

26:21.667 --> 26:23.166
you know, nothing too crazy.

26:23.200 --> 26:24.734
- Blowjob shots?

26:24.767 --> 26:27.000
- Lisa, you've never
had a blowjob shot?

26:27.033 --> 26:29.233
- No.

26:29.266 --> 26:30.400
- There we go.

26:33.300 --> 26:37.133
- Bye--oh, no!

26:37.166 --> 26:38.700
- Agh...

26:38.734 --> 26:40.300
- Did you have some
birthday sex this morning?

26:40.333 --> 26:42.133
- Should've, but...
- Should've, but no!

26:42.166 --> 26:43.734
- Work on that one later.

26:43.767 --> 26:45.333
- Just jot it down for
something to do later.

26:45.367 --> 26:47.133
- Coming up...

26:47.166 --> 26:49.767
- Do you wanna continue this,
like, upset, negative vibe,

26:50.000 --> 26:51.633
or do you wanna hash it out?
- No, it's not negative.

26:51.667 --> 26:55.567
You did me really
----ing dirty.

27:06.033 --> 27:07.767
- Whoo. Oh, this is nice.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.033
I don't think I've ever been
down here before.

27:10.066 --> 27:12.333
- Whoo. I love this.

27:17.700 --> 27:20.233
- Let's try, uh,
this one second.

27:20.266 --> 27:22.066
This one first.
This one third.

27:22.100 --> 27:24.467
- What's up?

27:24.500 --> 27:27.066
- Good to see you, dude.
Thanks for coming, bro.

27:27.100 --> 27:29.300
I have some cigars here.

27:29.333 --> 27:31.767
- Other way. There you go.
Oh, whoa.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.166
- Cheers, cheers,
happy birthday.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.667
all: Happy birthday!

27:35.700 --> 27:37.233
- You're 36!

27:37.266 --> 27:39.266
- How does that sound
so much older than 35?

27:39.300 --> 27:41.734
- I'm 26.

27:46.133 --> 27:47.767
Where's your old lady at?

27:48.000 --> 27:49.400
- She's using her hall pass
I gave her.

27:49.433 --> 27:51.000
- So, does Katie get to
make out with a girl?

27:51.033 --> 27:52.467
- Yes.
- I mean, with a guy?

27:52.500 --> 27:54.467
- Yes, and if it's Bieber,
she can go all the way.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.400
- If Brittany hooked up
with a girl,

27:56.433 --> 27:58.066
which she's already have--has,
the only reason I'd be mad

27:58.100 --> 27:59.367
is if she got mad at me
for something.

27:59.400 --> 28:01.000
Then I would use it
as a leverage.

28:01.033 --> 28:02.367
- Yes.

28:02.400 --> 28:04.133
Katie used to dip her foot
in the lady pond--

28:04.166 --> 28:05.767
well, I don't know
if I should be saying this.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.200
- They all have.

28:07.233 --> 28:08.667
- I don't know if I ever
told you this.

28:08.700 --> 28:12.767
Ariana and Lala had been
out all day, drinking...

28:14.700 --> 28:16.233
And they're wasted.

28:16.266 --> 28:18.700
They're in my car,
and Lala goes,

28:18.734 --> 28:22.233
"Sorry, Sando, I'm just in love
with your girl right now.

28:22.266 --> 28:24.133
"Ariana, will you climb
in the backseat?

28:24.166 --> 28:27.166
I just wanna eat your p----."

28:27.200 --> 28:28.166
- What?

28:28.200 --> 28:30.000
- Ariana climbs in the back,

28:30.033 --> 28:32.367
and Lala just starts going
to ----ing town, dude.

28:34.033 --> 28:36.100
Oh, my God!

28:36.133 --> 28:37.500
That is crazy!

28:37.533 --> 28:39.400
- Did you have a threesome?
- Couldn't do it.

28:39.433 --> 28:41.166
- Collateral suckage!

28:41.200 --> 28:43.166
You don't think she's gonna
get in there somehow?

28:43.200 --> 28:45.400
Lala's a freak in the bedroom.
Let's just face it at that.

28:45.433 --> 28:47.133
Definitely would've
sucked your d---.

28:47.166 --> 28:49.433
She does handstands.

28:49.467 --> 28:51.400
I mean, it's pretty
unbelievable if you ask me.

28:51.433 --> 28:53.367
There's no stopping horny Lala.

28:53.400 --> 28:54.767
- I stopped it.

28:56.734 --> 28:59.000
- No, I didn't.
Don't start sh--, man.

28:59.033 --> 29:01.033
We're bringing you here, and
you're starting to start sh--.

29:01.066 --> 29:02.367
This is the reason why
we don't have you around.

29:02.400 --> 29:04.133
You gotta know your role.

29:04.166 --> 29:06.133
- He's just giving you sh--.
Relax.

29:06.166 --> 29:07.500
- Tread lightly, man. That's
all I'm saying, tread lightly.

29:07.533 --> 29:09.233
- What are you gonna do
about it?

29:09.266 --> 29:10.433
- You're not gonna be
around for anything.

29:10.467 --> 29:11.767
- Don't even tell me
your birthday party,

29:12.000 --> 29:13.433
'cause I already
bought the skates.

29:13.467 --> 29:15.233
- I don't care, which is
why I'm the number one dude.

29:15.266 --> 29:16.567
- I want both of you right now

29:16.600 --> 29:19.367
to just take a deep breath in.

29:32.367 --> 29:34.567
- Hello.
- Hi.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.567
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

29:36.600 --> 29:40.033
- Exhausted.
- Yeah, me too.

29:40.066 --> 29:43.066
- How's everything with you
since Girls Night?

29:43.100 --> 29:46.000
- I haven't talked
to Katie at all.

29:46.033 --> 29:48.033
I honestly wanna
sit down with her.

29:48.066 --> 29:49.400
- I think this is
a misunderstanding.

29:49.433 --> 29:51.367
They're very supportive
of who you are.

29:51.400 --> 29:53.200
It's very important to me
that we do not have

29:53.233 --> 29:56.133
this huge divide
down the center of Sur,

29:56.166 --> 29:57.533
and bigotry

29:57.567 --> 30:02.166
and transgender phobia
and homophobia

30:02.200 --> 30:05.066
is everything that
we stand against.

30:05.100 --> 30:07.033
- Scheana had
her housewarming party,

30:07.066 --> 30:10.467
and Lala and I, like,
really got into it.

30:10.500 --> 30:13.100
I'm just avoiding her
until things calm down for her.

30:13.133 --> 30:15.433
I think that's the best way.
- Probably a wise thing.

30:15.467 --> 30:17.333
You gotta make sure it's okay
when you're working.

30:17.367 --> 30:19.033
- I'll avoid her,

30:19.066 --> 30:21.133
and I'll avoid any, like,
harsh situation at work.

30:21.166 --> 30:24.367
- You've got this.
- Yeah.

30:34.133 --> 30:36.367
- Hey, baby!

30:36.400 --> 30:38.433
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

30:38.467 --> 30:40.367
- You look cute.
How have you been?

30:40.400 --> 30:43.400
- Good. How have you been since
I last saw your pretty face?

30:43.433 --> 30:44.600
- Good.
- Hey.

30:44.633 --> 30:46.333
- Hi, Jaxie.
- What's going on?

30:46.367 --> 30:48.233
The last time I saw you,
you kinda just bee-lined it.

30:48.266 --> 30:49.500
- You darted.

30:49.533 --> 30:51.300
- I don't know if you were
mad about the fact

30:51.333 --> 30:52.600
that you had to go all the way
down to Marina del Rey or...

30:52.633 --> 30:54.367
- Maybe both.

30:54.400 --> 30:56.266
- Well, let's get this
out of the way real fast.

30:56.300 --> 30:57.633
Let's take another picture,
but, like, you can be, like,

30:57.667 --> 30:59.333
looking down with
the cowboy hat on.

30:59.367 --> 31:01.133
You won't be able to see
your face or anything.

31:01.166 --> 31:03.200
Just, like, that they can use
for the flier maybe.

31:03.233 --> 31:05.033
- So, once again,

31:05.066 --> 31:06.500
if bringing my tits out
is gonna help sell

31:06.533 --> 31:09.233
a few more Pumptinis
on Girls Night In,

31:09.266 --> 31:10.467
let the girls out.

31:13.100 --> 31:14.367
- So, it's like this, right?

31:14.400 --> 31:16.467
- This is gonna be,
like, for the flier.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.266
- Oh, tipping your head down.
I like that.

31:18.300 --> 31:19.400
- Yeah.

31:19.433 --> 31:21.200
- Can I tell you something?

31:21.233 --> 31:23.166
- You can always
tell me something.

31:23.200 --> 31:25.367
- I had Tom Sandoval's
birthday today.

31:25.400 --> 31:28.200
He told us that
he took a ride

31:28.233 --> 31:30.100
with you and Ariana...
- Yeah? Yeah?

31:30.133 --> 31:32.567
- And stuff happened.
- Like what?

31:32.600 --> 31:34.433
- You and Ariana hooked up
in the backseat of the car,

31:34.467 --> 31:36.166
and he was in there.

31:36.200 --> 31:37.333
- Me and Ariana hooked up
in the back of it?

31:37.367 --> 31:38.600
- I guess, you--yeah...

31:38.633 --> 31:40.266
you asked for Ariana
to come in the backseat

31:40.300 --> 31:43.066
and do stuff.

31:43.100 --> 31:45.633
- No, I did not have sex

31:45.667 --> 31:47.400
with Ariana in the back.

31:47.433 --> 31:49.500
What the (BLEEP)
is he talking about?

31:49.533 --> 31:54.500
Did this happen with
Ariana and myself?

31:54.533 --> 31:56.100
Yes.

31:56.133 --> 31:58.166
Am I about to blow
Ariana's spot up

31:58.200 --> 31:59.567
with Jax and Brittany
right now?

31:59.600 --> 32:01.266
Hell no.

32:01.300 --> 32:03.367
- James showed up.
He hasn't changed a bit, man.

32:03.400 --> 32:04.433
- What do you mean?
Tell me everything.

32:04.467 --> 32:05.633
- You should probably tell him

32:05.667 --> 32:07.367
not to discuss
your sexual history either

32:07.400 --> 32:08.633
in front of all of us
today even.

32:08.667 --> 32:10.300
That was not cool.
- He did that?

32:10.333 --> 32:12.166
- Of course he did.
- What did he say?

32:12.200 --> 32:13.667
- Some kind of handstand thing,
and I'll just leave it at that.

32:13.700 --> 32:16.467
- He is ----ing repulsive.

32:16.500 --> 32:19.433
- Dude, there's not one bit
of change in that kid.

32:19.467 --> 32:22.500
- No. No.
What a sick slime.

32:28.467 --> 32:31.133
- Shhh...

32:32.433 --> 32:34.266
- What's up?

32:34.300 --> 32:36.400
- Hi, birthday boy.
- Where's Lisa?

32:36.433 --> 32:38.533
I heard she was here.
I wanna thank her for--

32:38.567 --> 32:42.467
she got us lunch
and blowjob shots.

32:42.500 --> 32:43.700
- She, like,
literally just left.

32:43.734 --> 32:45.467
- All right, bye.

32:45.500 --> 32:47.333
I'll see you tomorrow.
- I'll see you later.

32:55.300 --> 32:56.633
- What's wrong?

32:56.667 --> 32:59.233
- Are you ----ing kidding me?

32:59.266 --> 33:01.300
I literally just got
a phone call from Lala,

33:01.333 --> 33:04.433
telling me the ----ing story
you told on your birthday

33:04.467 --> 33:06.600
to try to sound cool
in front of a bunch of guys.

33:06.633 --> 33:08.467
- It's not that big of a deal.
- It's not a big deal?

33:08.500 --> 33:10.166
- Ariana, Ariana,
wait, wait, wait.

33:10.200 --> 33:12.400
- I'm sorry,
but it's my business.

33:12.433 --> 33:14.266
I'm not embarrassed or ashamed

33:14.300 --> 33:16.600
of what happened
between Lala and I,

33:16.633 --> 33:20.133
but I do feel like
Tom betrayed my trust

33:20.166 --> 33:23.300
by telling the story
to his guy friends.

33:23.333 --> 33:25.734
My sexuality is not something
that is meant to, like,

33:25.767 --> 33:29.333
"sound cool" to
a bunch of dudes.

33:29.367 --> 33:30.700
You told Jax,

33:30.734 --> 33:33.367
who will tell anybody
with ----ing earlobes

33:33.400 --> 33:37.266
anything that comes through
his goddamn tiny, little mind.

33:37.300 --> 33:39.233
- You've been in a relationship
with a girl before.

33:39.266 --> 33:40.700
- Yes, okay, Tom...

33:40.734 --> 33:44.200
you told something that is
not your business to tell,

33:44.233 --> 33:46.233
without running it
by the people

33:46.266 --> 33:47.500
who were really involved.

33:47.533 --> 33:49.233
- I was slightly annoyed
that night,

33:49.266 --> 33:50.600
because I was the one
who was trying...

33:50.633 --> 33:52.367
- That's fine,
then tell me you're annoyed.

33:54.333 --> 33:56.166
Why don't you leave my bar
right now.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.767
- I'm sorry.
- You're annoying, goodbye.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.667
You're annoying--
- Can I get a birthday cocktail?

33:59.700 --> 34:02.567
- No. Your hat's annoying.
Your ----ing face is annoying.

34:02.600 --> 34:05.467
Goodbye.

34:09.567 --> 34:11.400
- Roller skating party?

34:11.433 --> 34:12.767
I've been trying to do
one of these forever.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.567
You're gonna love my costume.

34:14.600 --> 34:16.000
- The last time
I roller-skated,

34:16.033 --> 34:17.734
I knocked the wind
out of myself.

34:17.767 --> 34:20.300
- Like, the last time I, like,
earnestly went roller skating

34:20.333 --> 34:23.433
was probably...1995.

34:23.467 --> 34:25.400
- Is that just your costume
right there?

34:25.433 --> 34:26.667
- This is a '70s shirt.

34:26.700 --> 34:30.200
- No, you're like
70-year-old man.

34:30.233 --> 34:32.533
- 70-year-old man, they're
gonna wear cool cutoffs?

34:32.567 --> 34:33.667
- I'm like Studio 54.

34:33.700 --> 34:37.400
- Well, I'm Palm Springs '70s.

34:37.433 --> 34:40.400
I did rollerblade
when I was in eighth grade.

34:40.433 --> 34:42.266
Then I did the trick ones,
where I took out a wheel,

34:42.300 --> 34:43.700
and I, like,
rail-slided and sh--.

34:43.734 --> 34:45.300
- So, you're really good
at skating?

34:45.333 --> 34:46.433
- I'm really good at skating.

34:46.467 --> 34:48.033
- I might be good
at skating too.

34:48.066 --> 34:49.233
- Yep.

34:49.266 --> 34:51.734
- Apparently, Lala legitimately

34:51.767 --> 34:57.367
just pulls Ariana into
the backseat of Sandoval's car,

34:57.400 --> 34:59.633
and starts going down on her.

34:59.667 --> 35:01.367
- What?

35:01.400 --> 35:03.300
- Why aren't girls asking
to go down on me?

35:03.333 --> 35:04.567
What's wrong with me?

35:04.600 --> 35:06.500
It was a real-life porno movie.

35:06.533 --> 35:08.734
- Lala, like, full-out
just lied to our faces.

35:08.767 --> 35:10.467
And she was so, like--
I believed her.

35:10.500 --> 35:12.000
I was like, "Okay."

35:12.033 --> 35:14.633
- I would've never, ever,
like, thought that...

35:14.667 --> 35:16.667
- Yeah.
- Or expected that.

35:16.700 --> 35:18.300
- "I'm all about it."
- Yeah?

35:18.333 --> 35:20.667
- I'm speaking in character.

35:20.700 --> 35:23.000
- Coming up...

35:23.033 --> 35:25.066
- Oh! Ah!

35:25.100 --> 35:26.633
- I love you so much.

35:32.033 --> 35:32.367
- ♪ Whoa-oh ♪

35:35.533 --> 35:39.700
- So, obviously we have
some things to talk about.

35:39.734 --> 35:43.500
When you talk about

35:43.533 --> 35:47.500
anyone's sexuality
without their consent,

35:47.533 --> 35:50.033
it's, like, really not okay.

35:51.533 --> 35:54.333
There was a part of me
that was, like,

35:54.367 --> 35:55.767
annoyed by that situation,

35:56.000 --> 35:58.600
because you guys were wasted.

35:58.633 --> 36:01.300
- This is my sexuality
as a person.

36:01.333 --> 36:03.066
I don't talk about
that stuff openly

36:03.100 --> 36:05.500
with the entire ----ing world.

36:05.533 --> 36:07.567
But now it's like,
"Well, everybody knows."

36:07.600 --> 36:10.600
I've been with women
in the past,

36:10.633 --> 36:12.567
and obviously
I've been with men.

36:12.600 --> 36:14.734
I would rather
not label things,

36:14.767 --> 36:16.467
and just kind of...

36:16.500 --> 36:18.300
if you're attracted
to somebody,

36:18.333 --> 36:20.000
you're attracted to them,
and if you're not, you're not.

36:20.033 --> 36:22.433
And that person can be...

36:22.467 --> 36:26.533
male, female,
or anywhere in-between.

36:26.567 --> 36:29.066
- I don't like being that guy.

36:29.100 --> 36:30.533
You know, you're,
like, my treasure,

36:30.567 --> 36:32.100
and all those things
that I know about you,

36:32.133 --> 36:34.400
all those little quirks
and whatever,

36:34.433 --> 36:37.567
like, they're, like,
very valuable to me.

36:37.600 --> 36:41.000
And let's just hopefully
try to move on from this.

36:41.033 --> 36:43.133
- I mean, in a way,
I guess it's kinda like,

36:43.166 --> 36:45.500
"Yeah, well, that's--
here I am."

36:45.533 --> 36:49.400
I don't think Tom was
being malicious in any way,

36:49.433 --> 36:52.700
so part of me is really
grossed out and mad at him,

36:52.734 --> 36:54.033
and the other part
of me is like,

36:54.066 --> 36:55.400
"You poor, little thing.

36:55.433 --> 36:57.033
You thought you were
being cute."

36:57.066 --> 36:59.367
I love you.
- I love you too.

37:13.600 --> 37:16.567
- You look so cute!
- Thanks, so do you.

37:16.600 --> 37:19.500
- Oh, yes. Thanks, man.

37:19.533 --> 37:21.400
- Oh, my God.

37:24.633 --> 37:28.133
- There is no way my face
is not gonna be busted.

37:28.166 --> 37:30.200
- If you fall, just hold--
make sure the boobs are--

37:30.233 --> 37:32.066
just face away.

37:32.100 --> 37:34.567
- This is my 39th birthday.
I was born in '79.

37:34.600 --> 37:37.400
The '70s,
that's my favorite era.

37:37.433 --> 37:39.467
I love the cars;
I love the music.

37:39.500 --> 37:40.467
I just--I just love it.

37:44.600 --> 37:47.000
- Hey. Oh, what's that?

37:47.033 --> 37:48.400
- Uh, mac and cheese.

37:48.433 --> 37:50.500
- So, what's up
with you and Adam?

37:50.533 --> 37:51.734
- What do you mean?

37:51.767 --> 37:53.734
- Are you guys ----ing?

37:53.767 --> 37:56.000
'Cause that's what I heard!

37:56.033 --> 37:58.734
I'm just ki--I'm just kidding,
but seriously?

37:58.767 --> 38:00.467
- Yes, it was ----ing amazing.

38:00.500 --> 38:02.600
Everyone is, like,
very, very interested

38:02.633 --> 38:04.433
in who I'm sleeping with,

38:04.467 --> 38:07.200
'cause this has been, like,
a year in the making.

38:07.233 --> 38:09.200
He's my best friend.

38:09.233 --> 38:11.567
And we've always said we don't
want it to get complicated,

38:11.600 --> 38:13.633
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
- Blah, blah, blah.

38:13.667 --> 38:15.100
Look, I'm just
talking to Scheana

38:15.133 --> 38:16.667
maybe to hear
a good story, okay?

38:16.700 --> 38:18.734
I don't wanna hear all about
her ----ing best friend.

38:18.767 --> 38:21.033
Raquel, do you want
some chicken?

38:21.066 --> 38:22.767
I mean, you liked him,
you guys banged.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.500
What's complicated about that?

38:24.533 --> 38:26.500
I need a ----ing fork.

38:26.533 --> 38:28.667
- You do.

38:28.700 --> 38:30.500
- I'll find a new one.

38:35.066 --> 38:37.467
- Don't brag. Don't brag.

38:37.500 --> 38:39.233
You're annoying.

38:39.266 --> 38:42.233
- Oh! Ah!

38:42.266 --> 38:44.133
- Jax, we gotta play
the punching machine after.

38:44.166 --> 38:45.500
- I'll try it out.
I'll try it out.

38:45.533 --> 38:47.033
- You have to do
the punching machine.

38:47.066 --> 38:49.033
- If his face
is in front of it.

38:59.066 --> 39:00.667
- I'm scared to roller skate.

39:00.700 --> 39:02.266
- Do you see me?
I'm going like this.

39:02.300 --> 39:04.567
I'm not exactly
the best roller skater.

39:04.600 --> 39:06.500
And I'm so hot in this wig.

39:06.533 --> 39:07.667
Do I look sweaty?

39:07.700 --> 39:09.500
- No, you don't look
sweaty at all.

39:11.266 --> 39:13.166
- So, obviously I was like--

39:13.200 --> 39:16.467
when you called me,
I had no idea what was said.

39:16.500 --> 39:19.266
- I was at Jax and Brittany's
house, and they brought it up.

39:19.300 --> 39:20.767
I knew--right off the bat,
I was like,

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
"I'm lying about this
until I talk to Ariana."

39:23.033 --> 39:24.533
- Until we talk.

39:24.567 --> 39:26.000
I'm not ashamed of myself,

39:26.033 --> 39:28.100
and I'm not ashamed
of anything I've done.

39:28.133 --> 39:29.533
- No.

39:29.567 --> 39:31.200
- It's not so much
the thing that happened.

39:31.233 --> 39:33.433
It's that people
are talking about it,

39:33.467 --> 39:36.533
when I felt like
it was our business.

39:36.567 --> 39:39.600
People do say a lot of sh---y
things about bisexual people.

39:39.633 --> 39:42.166
I mean, maybe that's why I
don't talk about it that much.

39:42.200 --> 39:44.200
- I felt so awkward that
people are just, like,

39:44.233 --> 39:47.133
talking about what I do
with my mouth and my vagina.

39:47.166 --> 39:48.533
Just didn't really
want it put out there

39:48.567 --> 39:50.233
in front of James Kennedy.

39:50.266 --> 39:53.100
Ugh. ----ing James, dude.

39:53.133 --> 39:55.200
His behavior is unacceptable,

39:55.233 --> 39:57.033
and I'm not putting up
with it anymore.

39:57.066 --> 39:58.567
And if you would've told me,
"Nope, didn't happen,"

39:58.600 --> 40:00.100
I would've been like,
"I got your back..."

40:00.133 --> 40:01.567
- "No, I don't know
what you're talking about."

40:01.600 --> 40:03.066
- "We lie until the death."

40:10.300 --> 40:12.567
- Kay, I'm way better at ice
skating than roller skating.

40:12.600 --> 40:15.200
- Oh, I can do, like, laps.

40:15.233 --> 40:17.667
I've never heard anyone ever
talk about roller skating,

40:17.700 --> 40:20.734
and everyone's a pro,
apparently.

40:20.767 --> 40:23.600
- Oh, my God...
I'm, like, out of breath.

40:23.633 --> 40:25.266
What's up, girls?

40:25.300 --> 40:27.166
- We were just saying,
if it was like ice skating,

40:27.200 --> 40:29.000
it would be way better...
- Yeah.

40:29.033 --> 40:30.734
- But this is so different.

40:30.767 --> 40:32.100
- Tom...

40:34.633 --> 40:37.567
- Katie, um, we haven't
had a chance to talk.

40:37.600 --> 40:39.667
I wanna start off
with apologizing.

40:41.633 --> 40:45.200
- You did me really
----ing dirty.

40:45.233 --> 40:48.200
- I'm sorry that I lashed out
with the tweet.

40:48.233 --> 40:50.033
- You're just dramatic.

40:50.066 --> 40:53.066
- Do you wanna continue this,
like, upset, negative vibe?

40:53.100 --> 40:55.600
- Listen, there's another
Girls Night on Tuesday.

40:55.633 --> 40:57.533
Obviously you're invited.

40:57.567 --> 40:59.200
Please come.

40:59.233 --> 41:02.600
I get that Billie has had
a lifetime of being excluded

41:02.633 --> 41:05.133
that she is now
projecting onto me,

41:05.166 --> 41:06.700
but I just--
I can't accept that,

41:06.734 --> 41:09.066
so I'm just keeping a distance.

41:09.100 --> 41:10.233
- But I appreciate
you including me

41:10.266 --> 41:11.667
in the next Girls Night.

41:11.700 --> 41:13.166
- You are always included.
- Thank you.

41:13.200 --> 41:16.066
- ♪ I hate this so much ♪

41:16.100 --> 41:17.233
Whew!

41:19.767 --> 41:25.100
all:
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

41:25.133 --> 41:27.066
♪ Happy birthday ♪

41:27.100 --> 41:28.100
- Oh!

41:28.133 --> 41:30.266
all: ♪ To you ♪

41:30.300 --> 41:32.767
I love you so much.
- Thank you, dumpling.

41:36.200 --> 41:39.333
- Jameson!

41:39.367 --> 41:41.567
Just you.

41:41.600 --> 41:44.133
- Oh, what now?
- What do you mean, "What now"?

41:44.166 --> 41:47.000
You were having a fun outing
with the boys,

41:47.033 --> 41:50.000
and you're talking about
me doing handstands in bed.

41:50.033 --> 41:51.600
- Well, they brought
you up first.

41:51.633 --> 41:53.333
- That doesn't matter, James.
- So, why does--

41:53.367 --> 41:56.734
- I would never, ever, ever
talk about you in a sexual way.

41:56.767 --> 41:58.300
- It was just an innocent joke.

41:58.333 --> 42:01.300
- I just want to know
that at the end of the day,

42:01.333 --> 42:04.667
you're going to finally
respect my relationships.

42:04.700 --> 42:06.266
- I'm just gonna keep
my mouth shut right now,

42:06.300 --> 42:08.133
'cause I'm trying
to have new ways now.

42:08.166 --> 42:10.166
I'm trying to be more positive.
- I mean, you have to.

42:13.166 --> 42:14.266
- Can you get it
to him, though?

42:14.300 --> 42:16.033
- I can text you
an address, okay?

42:16.066 --> 42:19.100
- All right.

42:19.133 --> 42:21.433
- Raquel, I'm sorry
I called you a twat.

42:23.166 --> 42:24.266
You're welcome.

42:27.367 --> 42:30.700
- Next time on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

42:30.734 --> 42:33.266
I cannot believe that
we're gonna have a party

42:33.300 --> 42:35.100
in 48 hours.

42:35.133 --> 42:39.166
- Maybe this will be
my sole duty at TomTom.

42:39.200 --> 42:41.100
- Do you really want
your mom to call you?

42:41.133 --> 42:44.066
- I just don't understand
why she's so angry.

42:46.066 --> 42:49.667
- I don't wanna see people,
like, declining your invites.

42:49.700 --> 42:51.300
- Well, I'm never gonna win
with them; I never have.

42:51.333 --> 42:54.133
- You never have,
and you probably never will.

42:54.166 --> 42:55.700
- I'm not coming after you...

42:55.734 --> 42:57.367
- Dude, Girls Night hurts
the (BLEEP) out of me.

42:57.400 --> 42:59.300
I hate Katie for it.
- But you did it to yourself.

42:59.333 --> 43:00.700
- I hate all of them for it.

43:00.734 --> 43:02.734
How can I hide it?

43:02.767 --> 43:06.100
- To see more of "Vanderpump
Rules," go to bravotv.com.
