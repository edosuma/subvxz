In the name of Emperor Napoleon
and by the letter

00:07.400 --> 00:11.075
of the Declaration of the Rights
of Man and of the Citizen,

00:11.280 --> 00:15.068
we hereby proclaim
the Spanish Inquisition abolished.

00:15.560 --> 00:18.279
All of its properties confiscated

00:18.480 --> 00:22.268
and all of its prisoners
will be freed forthwith.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.036
Now, go away.

03:22.960 --> 03:24.871
I'm deaf.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.638
I'm deaf!

03:38.120 --> 03:40.315
Sit down. Sit down.

03:44.680 --> 03:47.513
You have to write,
write everything down.

03:49.160 --> 03:51.993
Write what happened,
I can't hear.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.189
Are you hungry?

03:55.480 --> 03:57.675
Are you hungry?

04:04.240 --> 04:05.798
I confessed,

04:06.840 --> 04:09.673
and they said I would be tried,

04:10.320 --> 04:12.515
but there was never a trial.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.115
My father is dead now.

04:17.880 --> 04:20.075
My whole family is dead.

04:27.480 --> 04:31.268
The only thing I can think
about is my child.

04:32.240 --> 04:34.117
You had a child?

04:34.600 --> 04:36.158
In prison?

04:42.800 --> 04:45.633
My daughter, my little girl.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.151
I need to see her.

04:48.360 --> 04:50.351
I need to take care of her.

04:50.520 --> 04:53.193
Can you help me find her?
Please?

05:01.280 --> 05:03.430
Inés, look at me.

05:03.640 --> 05:06.632
Swear to God Almighty
you're telling the truth.

05:12.640 --> 05:15.518
I need to talk to somebody
from the Holy Office.

05:15.720 --> 05:18.234
But the Holy Office is long gone.

05:20.360 --> 05:23.193
-But they're not all dead, are they?
-They might as well be.

05:23.400 --> 05:25.914
They're either all in prison
or on the run.

05:29.880 --> 05:32.599
Who's running the prison?
-The French.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.438
And Napoleon has sent

05:34.600 --> 05:36.909
a special prosecutor along
with his army.

05:40.560 --> 05:43.313
Will he receive me?
Where would I find him?

05:49.760 --> 05:51.910
Stay here. Watch her.

05:52.120 --> 05:53.678
Felipe!

06:10.840 --> 06:11.909
Silence!

06:16.320 --> 06:16.991
Silence!

06:23.200 --> 06:24.758
Quiet!

06:38.320 --> 06:39.230
I am here

06:39.400 --> 06:43.393
to serve the ideas of the
great French Revolution!

06:52.560 --> 06:54.471
They opened my eyes,

06:54.680 --> 06:57.831
as they are opening the eyes
of the blind all over the world,

06:58.040 --> 07:00.554
because they are irresistible.

07:01.560 --> 07:04.074
They are logical, they are just.

07:04.360 --> 07:05.998
Universal.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.437
All men, all men are born free.

07:18.360 --> 07:21.636
All possess the same rights,
and those...

07:22.320 --> 07:24.993
...those who refuse
to see the light of liberty

07:25.160 --> 07:26.912
shall receive no mercy.

07:27.120 --> 07:28.917
There will be...

07:29.520 --> 07:33.479
there will be no liberty
for the enemies of liberty!

07:41.560 --> 07:43.198
Father Gregorio...

07:46.600 --> 07:50.070
do not take this personally.
However...

07:51.160 --> 07:53.310
however you are

07:53.480 --> 07:54.879
the very incarnation

07:55.040 --> 07:57.270
of blind fanaticism and nepotism.

07:58.200 --> 08:00.634
You are the tool by the means
of which few

08:00.840 --> 08:03.991
have kept the many in chains.

08:04.200 --> 08:08.193
You exemplify the very worst aspect
of Spain

08:08.400 --> 08:11.551
and so you will be judged
for your deeds.

08:18.320 --> 08:22.313
By... By the unanimous decision
of the judges...

08:24.040 --> 08:27.191
and by the power vested in them
by the Declaration

08:27.400 --> 08:30.551
of the Rights of Man
and of the Citizen,

08:30.760 --> 08:32.318
this court

08:32.520 --> 08:34.272
sentences you...

08:36.240 --> 08:37.639
to death.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.714
Do you remember
that rich merchant

09:01.880 --> 09:04.269
that made you confess that you...

09:09.680 --> 09:10.908
Yes.

09:11.800 --> 09:15.793
-You remember.
-Sí. What was his name?

09:16.080 --> 09:17.593
Tomás Bilbatua.

09:17.800 --> 09:20.758
Yes, of course. How is he?

09:21.200 --> 09:22.599
Oh, he's dead.

09:23.160 --> 09:26.072
-I'm sorry to hear that.
-No, it's his daughter.

09:29.080 --> 09:30.957
She needs help.

09:31.360 --> 09:33.715
Of course. She can come
to see me any time she wants.

09:33.920 --> 09:36.593
Well, she's here.
She's in my carriage outside.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.677
Bring her in.

09:40.840 --> 09:43.035
I owe everything...

09:47.720 --> 09:51.508
-I owe everything to...
-No, you don't have to shout.

09:51.920 --> 09:54.115
You can just speak slowly

09:54.320 --> 09:57.153
and articulate
and I can read your lips.

10:00.680 --> 10:03.114
I owe everything to that man.

10:03.320 --> 10:06.756
Because of him I had
to run to France.

10:06.960 --> 10:09.315
And there suddenly,

10:09.480 --> 10:11.710
saw in one bright flash

10:11.920 --> 10:15.390
how terribly wrong I had been
all my life.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.068
Reading...

10:17.280 --> 10:19.669
Reading Voltaire, Rousseau...

10:20.520 --> 10:22.431
Meeting Danton. Look,

10:22.640 --> 10:24.676
I was baptised again.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.315
I shed blood
for the Revolution.

10:27.520 --> 10:31.195
-A nasty wound.
-And I even got married there.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.914
Yes, Henrietta, my wife.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.314
I love her...
And I have three children.

10:38.080 --> 10:41.038
Yes, I who took the vows
of celibacy.

10:42.520 --> 10:45.432
So you will have to paint
my portrait

10:45.600 --> 10:47.591
with the whole family.

10:48.040 --> 10:49.268
That's...

10:50.000 --> 10:52.514
That's ten hands to paint.

10:53.160 --> 10:56.630
Ten.
And I can afford them all now.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.878
Come in.

11:01.960 --> 11:03.188
Inés.

11:05.160 --> 11:07.674
-This is Lorenzo...
-Casamares.

11:07.880 --> 11:09.871
Lorenzo Casamares.

11:11.640 --> 11:13.437
What can I do for you, miss?

11:14.400 --> 11:16.914
Don't, no, no, please, stop this,
stop.

11:17.280 --> 11:19.157
Stop, please.

11:20.040 --> 11:21.598
Sit down.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.428
Sit.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.997
Just tell me

11:27.360 --> 11:30.511
what do you need?
What can I do for you?

11:31.400 --> 11:34.392
What happened to our child?

11:35.240 --> 11:37.754
-I beg your pardon?
-Is she...?

11:39.200 --> 11:41.077
Is she with you?

11:50.080 --> 11:53.231
How long did they keep you
in that prison?

11:54.400 --> 11:56.755
I don't know.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.228
And...

12:00.960 --> 12:03.679
you think you had a child
in there?

12:03.880 --> 12:05.757
A little girl.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.959
-Our daughter
-"Our" daughter?

12:13.560 --> 12:16.836
Why do you believe that I am
the father of your little girl?

12:18.440 --> 12:20.237
Because you're

12:20.400 --> 12:22.868
the only man I've ever known.

12:23.640 --> 12:26.154
Please, sit down,
sit down, please.

12:35.440 --> 12:37.556
What happened to the child?

12:37.760 --> 12:39.637
I don't know.

12:40.280 --> 12:42.475
They took her from me

12:42.680 --> 12:43.908
before...

12:45.160 --> 12:47.674
she even tasted my milk.

13:10.960 --> 13:12.837
Inés, my dear, come here.

13:13.120 --> 13:14.678
Come, come.

13:16.800 --> 13:18.438
Now,

13:18.640 --> 13:21.632
you will go
with this nice young man

13:21.840 --> 13:24.434
and he will take you
to your daughter.

13:24.640 --> 13:26.198
All right?

13:26.880 --> 13:29.394
You just go with him.

13:30.040 --> 13:33.510
Go on.
Everything will be fine.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.117
I feel...

13:47.560 --> 13:50.711
such pity for these poor souls.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.916
How barbaric we were...

13:55.080 --> 13:57.071
Where are you sending her?

13:57.440 --> 14:00.273
She has obviously taken leave
of her senses in jail.

14:02.640 --> 14:06.428
However, I will not fail her.
I promise you.

14:06.640 --> 14:09.359
Will she be all right?
-She will be well provided for.

14:09.560 --> 14:12.791
You think she invented the story
about her child?

14:15.280 --> 14:18.113
I'm afraid so.
I'm sure she did.

14:20.320 --> 14:21.878
Tell me...

14:22.720 --> 14:24.756
if a prisoner gave birth

14:24.920 --> 14:26.831
in the dungeons
of the Holy Office,

14:28.080 --> 14:30.753
what would have happened
to the child?

14:34.000 --> 14:35.877
Might it concern

14:37.160 --> 14:39.037
your child?

14:40.120 --> 14:41.348
Please,

14:42.520 --> 14:44.875
respond to my question.

14:45.520 --> 14:47.078
If I do,

14:47.800 --> 14:51.475
will you spare whatever remains
of my life?

14:51.680 --> 14:54.513
Will you kindly let me die
in peace?

14:56.520 --> 14:58.158
Yes.

15:00.280 --> 15:03.636
Can I trust a... a monkey?

15:08.480 --> 15:09.879
Yes.

15:14.080 --> 15:17.436
There are no girls here born in '93
and brought from Madrid?

15:18.280 --> 15:20.157
Are there?

15:22.640 --> 15:26.110
There was one who would answer
that description.

15:29.080 --> 15:30.911
1793, Madrid,

15:31.080 --> 15:33.594
sent here
by the Holy Office.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.199
Which one is she?

15:35.400 --> 15:37.072
She's not here.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.549
She ran away from us
when she was only 11.

15:40.320 --> 15:42.197
Where is she now?

15:42.400 --> 15:44.755
Only God can answer
that question.

15:44.960 --> 15:47.315
She was a little tiger.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.955
Is it known
who her parents were?

15:55.520 --> 15:57.078
Not really.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.916
Did they mention their names?

16:03.600 --> 16:06.433
Oh, no. They never do.

16:08.720 --> 16:11.393
-Did you baptise her?
-Oh, immediately.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.795
What was her baptismal name?

16:14.240 --> 16:15.070
Alicia.

16:15.760 --> 16:17.034
Alicia.

16:17.440 --> 16:18.668
Alicia.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.358
Come on.

16:59.840 --> 17:01.398
Come on.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.749
Who was that girl there?
-Her name is Alicia. She's sweet...

17:16.960 --> 17:19.520
What's her name?
-Alicia.

17:19.720 --> 17:21.597
Write it down.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.958
Alicia.

17:24.160 --> 17:25.912
All right. Alicia.

17:26.119 --> 17:28.953
Will she be back?
-Oh, no, no, not today. Tomorrow.

17:29.160 --> 17:31.913
What?
-You can have her tomorrow.

17:35.520 --> 17:38.557
My God, what is this?

17:39.360 --> 17:41.590
This is by the Flemish painter
Hieronymus Bosch...

17:42.120 --> 17:43.599
El Bosco, Sire.

17:43.760 --> 17:45.910
It's called
'The Garden of Earthly Delights'.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.391
-Do you like this?
Well,

17:48.600 --> 17:52.354
it is very bizarre, you are right,
but of course it's Flemish.

17:52.560 --> 17:55.074
And it is very well painted.

17:55.480 --> 17:58.313
This is neither my kind of a garden
nor my kind of delights.

17:59.200 --> 18:01.350
I would never send this
to Napoleon.

18:01.560 --> 18:04.313
This is not my brother's taste...
No!

18:04.520 --> 18:06.431
You can keep this thing right
here in Madrid.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.673
Ah, now this looks promising.

18:13.880 --> 18:16.189
This is Carlos the Fourth.

18:16.400 --> 18:19.312
I met him... and his wife.

18:19.680 --> 18:21.875
Although I don't recall her being
that ugly.

18:22.640 --> 18:25.473
How did she manage
to have so many lovers?

18:25.680 --> 18:28.194
She was the Queen, Sire.

18:30.560 --> 18:32.915
This... is a masterpiece.

18:33.120 --> 18:36.476
-Indeed it is, Sire.
-My brother would appreciate this.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.909
And he can just do that?

18:40.120 --> 18:43.556
Take paintings from the Royal gallery
and pack them off to Paris?

18:43.760 --> 18:46.718
We have to express our gratitude
for what Napoleon did for freedom

18:46.920 --> 18:50.151
in Spain somehow darling. Yes?

18:51.560 --> 18:54.233
Senor Francisco de Goya
is here to see you, sir.

18:54.440 --> 18:56.317
-Bring him in.
Wait!

19:00.640 --> 19:04.110
Show Senor Goya to my study
and kindly ask him to wait.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.075
Thank you.

19:17.080 --> 19:19.275
I'm sorry, Francisco.

19:19.440 --> 19:21.510
At lunch I'm a family man.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.714
-May I offer you something to drink?
-No, thank you, no.

19:24.920 --> 19:27.559
I just want to get in touch
with Inés Bilbatua.

19:28.360 --> 19:29.998
Why?

19:30.720 --> 19:32.870
Well, she was telling the truth.

19:33.080 --> 19:35.594
She does have a daughter.

19:36.080 --> 19:37.957
How do you know?

19:38.240 --> 19:41.073
-I saw her.
-You saw her?

19:41.840 --> 19:43.068
Yes.

19:43.680 --> 19:45.796
Did you talk to her?

19:46.000 --> 19:47.877
No, no, I just saw her.

19:48.080 --> 19:51.993
How do you know that the girl
you saw is Inés's daughter?

19:53.680 --> 19:55.716
She looked exactly
like her mother did

19:55.880 --> 19:57.791
when I painted her 16 years ago.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.788
-She was, it was a perfect replica.
Where did you see her?

20:05.960 --> 20:08.349
In the Pardo Gardens.

20:09.800 --> 20:12.314
-In the Gardens?
-Yes.

20:13.800 --> 20:15.677
She is a...?

20:17.680 --> 20:19.671
Yes, she is.

20:20.840 --> 20:22.717
Do you know her name?

20:23.960 --> 20:25.598
-Alicia.
-Alicia.

20:25.800 --> 20:28.951
Do you think you could bring Inés
to my house?

20:29.480 --> 20:32.233
I want the mother
to meet her daughter.

20:32.480 --> 20:33.708
Of course.

20:37.040 --> 20:38.598
Come on.

20:56.400 --> 20:59.198
-Is your name Alicia?
-Yes.

21:01.320 --> 21:03.834
Where were you born, Alicia?

21:04.560 --> 21:06.596
In an orphanage.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.514
Do you know
who your parents were?

21:10.560 --> 21:12.710
My mother was a heretic.

21:26.360 --> 21:28.396
So, where do you wanna do it?

21:28.560 --> 21:29.629
Right here?

21:29.840 --> 21:32.957
Nowhere.
I just want to talk to you.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.316
You're not the police, are you?

21:39.200 --> 21:41.714
I would like to make you
a proposition.

21:42.960 --> 21:45.394
-All right.
-Leave Spain.

21:45.600 --> 21:47.397
-Leave Spain?
-Yes.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.158
-And go where?
-America.

21:49.360 --> 21:50.839
With you?

21:51.040 --> 21:52.996
No, but...

21:53.600 --> 21:55.477
if you leave Spain,

21:56.160 --> 21:59.470
I will provide you with enough money
that you will never want for...

21:59.680 --> 22:01.955
No, no, please let me out of the...

22:02.160 --> 22:04.116
-Now, please, stop this...!
Wait, calm down. Let me speak.

22:04.320 --> 22:06.629
I'm not gonna end up
in some brothel or harem?

22:06.840 --> 22:08.114
Let me speak.

22:08.320 --> 22:11.392
-Let go of me, or I'll scream.
Wait, stay here.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.716
Wait... Quiet, quiet.

22:14.080 --> 22:17.993
Quiet, quiet. Let me speak.
Quiet! Wait!

22:18.360 --> 22:20.157
Alicia, come back!

22:21.680 --> 22:24.513
Even if this Alicia actually
were Inés's daughter,

22:24.880 --> 22:27.394
which I doubt, which I doubt...

22:29.280 --> 22:31.157
If she were,

22:31.600 --> 22:34.751
I would never want to bring
those two together.

22:35.040 --> 22:36.598
Why not?

22:36.800 --> 22:38.677
For me,
the idea of telling a mother.

22:38.880 --> 22:40.916
"I found your daughter
and she's a whore"

22:41.080 --> 22:42.991
is unthinkable and cruel.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.355
I could never bring myself
to do it.

22:46.520 --> 22:48.715
But they're the same flesh
and blood.

22:48.920 --> 22:50.672
Plus, Francisco,

22:52.320 --> 22:56.154
Inés is not in control
of her senses.

22:59.040 --> 23:02.077
Where is she?
-She's in very good hands.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.430
Where?
I need to talk to her.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.636
Why is she so important to you?

23:07.400 --> 23:10.551
You are completely obsessed
with her.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.756
You yourself noticed her.

23:13.960 --> 23:17.509
That face is...
engraved on my mind.

23:18.320 --> 23:21.232
She's the angel descending
from heaven in 'La Florida'.

23:21.440 --> 23:24.955
I see her in taverns, I see her
in the streets, in my dreams.

23:25.600 --> 23:28.990
I saw her face when I thought
I was dying in Cádiz.

23:29.200 --> 23:31.236
And I didn't do anything for her
when she needed it.

23:31.440 --> 23:33.635
I'm not going
to abandon her again!

23:33.840 --> 23:36.035
Can you understand that?

23:37.800 --> 23:39.677
Where is she?

23:43.520 --> 23:44.748
Francisco,

23:47.120 --> 23:50.430
that poor woman
has lost her mind.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.718
I said where is she?

23:57.960 --> 24:00.918
-I don't care who you are.
-I'm painter to the King!

24:01.600 --> 24:05.070
To which King? Do you know how
many kings I have in here?

24:05.760 --> 24:08.752
I even have two Napoleons.
And one of them is an Arab.

24:08.960 --> 24:11.838
The other one is seven foot,
two inches tall.

24:13.320 --> 24:15.550
-Is he deaf?
-Yeah.

24:16.280 --> 24:19.113
Painter to the King.
He could be blind.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.309
So, who is this woman anyway?

24:24.520 --> 24:25.589
Inés Bilbatua.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.150
How much is she worth to you?

24:31.000 --> 24:34.788
-How much is she worth to you?
-One thousand reales.

24:35.280 --> 24:37.475
1,000? 100!

24:38.000 --> 24:39.797
100!

24:40.000 --> 24:43.834
You must be crazy! And take it
as a professional opinion!

24:44.040 --> 24:47.077
There are revolutions everywhere,
the world is going to hell.

24:47.280 --> 24:49.157
The British have landed
in Portugal

24:49.320 --> 24:51.038
and I am responsible
for this hospital.

24:51.240 --> 24:54.755
And you have the audacity
to offer me 100?

24:54.960 --> 24:56.837
500. 500.

24:57.040 --> 24:59.873
-200.
-All right.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.195
Is there anybody else here
that he wants?

25:24.000 --> 25:25.399
Inés.

25:28.200 --> 25:30.714
Oh, no... Not again.

25:31.400 --> 25:35.109
You cannot carry a baby
all your life. No woman can.

25:39.280 --> 25:40.235
No, María, no!

25:40.880 --> 25:42.199
-Stop it!
-Inés!

25:42.560 --> 25:43.993
Hold her.

25:44.200 --> 25:45.872
Get her! Stop it!

25:46.080 --> 25:48.196
Stop it. Let her go!

25:48.400 --> 25:51.039
-Inés, calm down.
-Inés!

25:51.360 --> 25:53.237
Inés!

25:56.760 --> 25:58.716
Don't you remember me?

26:02.080 --> 26:03.115
You can go home now.

26:05.240 --> 26:07.310
I found your daughter, Inés.

26:08.600 --> 26:09.828
See,

26:10.000 --> 26:12.719
you have to go.
He has found your daughter.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.316
-My daughter?
-Yes.

26:18.480 --> 26:19.913
My baby?

26:33.240 --> 26:34.468
Halt!

26:38.800 --> 26:42.270
What's happening here?
Why can't we go through?

26:45.560 --> 26:47.437
You can't go there.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.917
Inés, wait in the carriage.

26:51.160 --> 26:53.355
You keep an eye on her.

28:07.400 --> 28:09.038
Miss Alicia?

28:10.480 --> 28:12.232
Yes.

28:13.160 --> 28:15.037
I'm Francisco Goya.

28:16.160 --> 28:18.355
I'm painter to the King.

28:21.920 --> 28:23.831
Is that your child?

28:24.280 --> 28:25.190
No.

28:27.040 --> 28:30.191
I want you to come
with me and meet somebody.

28:30.600 --> 28:32.591
Another man?

28:33.320 --> 28:34.992
No.

28:36.040 --> 28:37.632
I understand.

28:37.840 --> 28:39.956
No, I'm not talking about...

28:40.160 --> 28:42.310
I want you to meet somebody
to whom you are very important.

28:42.520 --> 28:43.350
Who?

28:50.480 --> 28:51.799
Alicia,

28:52.000 --> 28:54.389
you've never met your mother,
have you?

28:55.840 --> 28:57.068
And?

29:16.560 --> 29:17.788
Alicia!

29:19.120 --> 29:20.997
Alicia, run!

29:24.400 --> 29:26.277
No, don't touch her!

29:27.400 --> 29:29.038
Alicia!

30:12.960 --> 30:15.155
Where is she?
-She went that way.

30:15.360 --> 30:18.033
But didn't I tell you...!
Go find her!

30:18.240 --> 30:20.674
I said Don Francisco wants you
to stay here.

30:20.880 --> 30:23.110
Bring her home! Bring her home!

31:23.560 --> 31:25.118
Bring him in.

31:33.360 --> 31:36.511
-Did you decree that deportation?
-Yes.

31:38.400 --> 31:41.233
So you're sending all these girls
to America

31:41.760 --> 31:44.228
just to get your poor harlot
daughter out of the way?

31:44.440 --> 31:48.115
This is the best thing for those
women, it's the best thing.

31:48.280 --> 31:50.157
What are you saying?
Say it again.

31:50.360 --> 31:52.237
It is a new life for them.
It is a new life.

31:53.200 --> 31:56.078
A new life? To be sold
as slaves in America?

31:56.280 --> 31:59.636
It is better than living
in this whorehouse called Spain.

31:59.840 --> 32:02.877
What are you saying?
Wake up, Francisco.

32:03.080 --> 32:05.833
The Spanish people couldn't care
less about ideals.

32:06.040 --> 32:09.316
Spain today
is one big whorehouse.

32:10.160 --> 32:11.354
Whore?

32:13.600 --> 32:15.795
Are you calling me a whore?

32:16.200 --> 32:18.873
You have the audacity
to call me a whore?

32:19.080 --> 32:21.594
And what are you? Look at you!

32:21.880 --> 32:23.711
Look what you are today.

32:23.920 --> 32:26.036
But do you remember
what you were yesterday?

32:27.280 --> 32:29.271
Who's the whore here?

32:30.320 --> 32:33.153
Don't lecture me, Francisco.

32:33.960 --> 32:37.714
Do not lecture me.
At least I tried to do something

32:37.920 --> 32:39.911
-and believed in what I was doing.
Wait.

32:40.120 --> 32:41.872
-I am a believer, Francisco.
Wait.

32:42.080 --> 32:44.913
I am a believer!... But you?

32:45.520 --> 32:47.397
Look at you.

32:48.280 --> 32:51.033
You work for anyone
who pays.

32:51.240 --> 32:53.151
Yesterday the King of Spain.

32:53.360 --> 32:55.828
Today the French.
Tomorrow?

32:56.000 --> 32:58.309
Probably that bastard Wellington!

32:58.520 --> 33:00.715
-No!
-Yes, Francisco.

33:01.200 --> 33:03.714
You only believe in money.

33:04.880 --> 33:06.359
You are the whore.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.358
What is it?

33:21.160 --> 33:23.833
The King has just received news

33:24.760 --> 33:27.718
that the British have crossed
the border from Portugal to Spain

33:27.920 --> 33:29.558
and are advancing.

33:30.120 --> 33:33.999
According to a reliable source,
they are not meeting any resistance

33:34.200 --> 33:37.988
and the Spanish are joining them
in their assault on our outposts.

33:38.840 --> 33:40.592
What are the King's orders?

33:40.800 --> 33:44.076
The King and his family left
for Madrid half an hour ago.

33:46.600 --> 33:49.831
-And Madrid?
-News hasn't reached the city yet.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.757
Inés.

34:53.440 --> 34:55.476
I want her to sleep.

34:55.639 --> 34:57.551
Her father has not seen her yet.

34:58.280 --> 35:01.750
Oh, I don't want her to be crying
when she sees him.

35:56.400 --> 35:57.628
Wait!

36:07.080 --> 36:08.308
Halt!

36:11.040 --> 36:13.429
Back to France, you cowards!

37:08.960 --> 37:10.188
Francoise?

38:00.200 --> 38:01.758
Brother Lorenzo,

38:02.600 --> 38:06.070
I hope you will understand there
is nothing personal

38:06.360 --> 38:07.429
in our judgement.

38:07.600 --> 38:08.555
However,

38:09.440 --> 38:11.556
you became

38:11.720 --> 38:14.518
the living embodiment
of diabolical ideas.

38:17.160 --> 38:20.311
You proclaimed that Man
is higher than God

38:21.080 --> 38:24.629
and that the words of the Gospels
are nothing but lies and poison.

38:27.040 --> 38:28.917
You must never

38:29.280 --> 38:32.352
never be allowed
to repeat your crimes.

38:33.160 --> 38:36.038
Therefore,
the Church declares you guilty,

38:36.680 --> 38:39.513
and your punishment
will be death.

38:40.800 --> 38:43.951
But if you repent publicly,

38:44.160 --> 38:46.754
the merciful hand
of the Church

38:46.960 --> 38:48.518
will spare your life.

38:52.040 --> 38:54.873
Your body will be saved,
and even your soul,

38:55.080 --> 38:56.718
if you join us again

38:56.880 --> 38:59.189
in the ever-loving arms
of God.

39:03.120 --> 39:04.348
Lorenzo,

39:05.160 --> 39:06.798
my son,

39:14.560 --> 39:16.755
will you repent?

39:55.200 --> 39:56.872
No, I'm sure.

40:24.400 --> 40:26.755
-In the name of the Father...
-God will forgive your sins.

40:26.960 --> 40:29.997
You have lost your sight, Brother.
Open your eyes.

40:30.840 --> 40:32.353
Lorenzo!

40:32.560 --> 40:33.629
Lorenzo!

40:34.200 --> 40:36.919
Lorenzo! Over here!

40:37.360 --> 40:39.590
Well, what do you think's going
to happen to him now?

40:39.800 --> 40:43.679
Brother, repent. You still have
time to plead for God's mercy.

40:43.880 --> 40:45.757
Repent. Repent.

41:01.400 --> 41:04.870
Come back to us, and God
will receive you into His arms.

41:06.600 --> 41:07.669
Open your eyes!

41:15.360 --> 41:17.555
Repent.
God will forgive your sins

41:17.720 --> 41:19.790
if you repent now! Repent...

41:24.360 --> 41:25.634
Oh God.

41:26.280 --> 41:28.794
Or you'll be damned
for all eternity.

41:29.200 --> 41:32.670
God will forgive your sins.
You have lost your sight, Brother.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.639
You still have time to plead
for God's mercy.

41:35.840 --> 41:38.274
For God is all merciful.

44:24.760 --> 44:26.113
Inés!
