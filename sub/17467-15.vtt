So anyway, I see him
every day in the cafeteria,

00:04.743 --> 00:07.311

just gonna give him my number.

00:07.355 --> 00:08.573

00:08.617 --> 00:11.446

a sweet guy.

I haven'’t heard from him,

to wonder.

Nothing. It'’s not important.

Then stop making
that noise.

00:26.461 --> 00:28.158
Yeah, Christy'’s
got another guy

00:28.202 --> 00:30.378
who'’s never gonna call and we're
trying to put a good face on it.

00:30.421 --> 00:32.423
He might still call.

00:32.467 --> 00:34.382

Bonnie, why don'’t you just
tell us what'’s bugging you?

00:40.692 --> 00:41.693
You really want to know?

And look where they put us:

00:55.316 --> 00:58.101
at a table downwind
from the bathroom.

00:59.494 --> 01:01.365
Are you kidding?

01:01.409 --> 01:03.628
You interrupted my story
'’cause we're at a table?

01:03.672 --> 01:05.065
What story?

01:05.108 --> 01:07.458
About the cafeteria guy
Christy'’s got no shot with.

You know, Icould call
the cafeteria guy.

You set boundaries
with this young man,

you were patient, and look
at that, he'’s come around.

that'’s an unforgivable offense,

to be a foster parent,

closer, I'’m kind of scared.

what it takes to be a good mom.

kids have some serious issues.

if a guy'’s divorced?

Oh, grow up. He didn'’t tell me.
I broke into his phone.

How'’d you do that?
The FBI can'’t do that.

07:45.116 --> 07:47.989
It'’s easy. You just have sex
with him till he falls asleep.

07:48.032 --> 07:50.818
Then you press his thumb onto
the home button of his phone.

you gonna do?

my ex-wife for lunch.

09:37.707 --> 09:39.013
Liar!

09:41.493 --> 09:43.017
Wait. What?

09:43.060 --> 09:46.586
Um, um, she'’s coming over
with my dog,

09:46.629 --> 09:48.631
and we got some stuff
to talk about.

09:48.675 --> 09:50.981
Well, why didn'’t you tell me
last night?

09:51.025 --> 09:54.724
'’Cause you were doing those
things, and I'’m not stupid.

09:54.768 --> 09:58.032
Okay, just so we'’re clear.

09:58.075 --> 10:01.035
Your ex-wife, who you'’re not
really divorced from,

10:01.078 --> 10:03.428
is coming over to chat,
and there'’s a dog.

10:03.472 --> 10:05.213
Okay, first of all,
we'’re not divorced

10:05.256 --> 10:07.607
because shehasn'’t gotten around
to signing the papers,

10:07.650 --> 10:09.347
and I told you about my dog.

10:09.391 --> 10:11.393
Yeah, yeah, Son of Sam.Samson.

10:11.436 --> 10:12.786
Close enough.

10:12.829 --> 10:14.439
And that'’s another thing.

10:14.483 --> 10:16.877
If it'’s your dog,
how come he lives with her?

10:16.920 --> 10:18.661
Because he'’s really old,
and it'’s hard for me

10:18.705 --> 10:20.271
to take care of him
in this thing.

10:23.579 --> 10:25.886
That checks out.

10:27.452 --> 10:28.758
But why the chitchat?

10:28.802 --> 10:31.718
We have some investment property
that we co-own.

10:31.761 --> 10:33.197
Might be time to sell.

10:33.241 --> 10:35.417
Wow, you just have
answers for everything.

10:35.460 --> 10:37.419
Oh, just relax, Bonnie.

10:37.462 --> 10:39.682
After last night,
I couldn'’t cheat on you

10:39.726 --> 10:43.425
if Angelina Jolie was buck naked
and lowered onto me by ropes.

10:43.468 --> 10:46.210
Uh-huh. So with a little rest
and a pulley system,

10:46.254 --> 10:48.691
you'’d take a whack
at Angelina Jolie?

10:48.735 --> 10:50.301
Yes! And so would you!

10:52.129 --> 10:54.871
Once again, you have answers
for everything!

10:57.091 --> 11:00.572
Oh, my God, why do I love her?!

11:00.616 --> 11:03.010
BEVERLY:
We don'’t know!

11:06.666 --> 11:09.712
So, as we speak, my boyfriend
and his semi ex-wife

11:09.756 --> 11:12.149
are having a romantic lunch
in his apartment.

11:12.193 --> 11:14.064
With his very old dog.

11:14.108 --> 11:16.588
Aw, Adam has a dog?
What kind?

11:16.632 --> 11:19.461
I think it'’s a "Shut the
hell up, Wendy" doodle.

11:23.465 --> 11:26.468
The point is, this broad'’s
plotting to get him back.

11:26.511 --> 11:28.426
Ex-wives'’ll do that.

11:28.470 --> 11:31.125
They'’ll get their boobs redone,
cook up a couple of steaks,

11:31.168 --> 11:34.171
invite the guy over
for a little night swimmin'’.

11:36.434 --> 11:39.176
Or stuff of that nature.

11:41.962 --> 11:44.399
Bonnie, if there'’s any hope
for you and Adam,

11:44.442 --> 11:46.096
you got to learn to trust him.

11:46.140 --> 11:48.272
Oh, I trust him. It'’s
her I'’m worried about.

11:48.316 --> 11:50.405
See right there,
that'’s your problem.

11:50.448 --> 11:52.973
Trying to control people,
places and things

11:53.016 --> 11:54.496
you can'’t do
anything about.

11:54.539 --> 11:56.759
What you need to do
is write down a list

11:56.803 --> 11:59.240
of all your fears,
and then just turn them over

11:59.283 --> 12:00.763
to your higher power, who'’s...

12:00.807 --> 12:02.634
Marjorie, she'’s gone again.

12:03.853 --> 12:06.464
But again, dynamite stuff.

12:11.469 --> 12:13.384
Can I help you?

12:14.951 --> 12:17.214
Oh. Hi.

12:18.563 --> 12:21.262
Are you Danielle Janikowski?

12:21.305 --> 12:23.307
I am. And you are?

12:23.351 --> 12:25.919
Bonnie Plunkett.

12:25.962 --> 12:28.008
Oh, great.

12:30.358 --> 12:33.056
Well, it appears he has a type.

12:33.100 --> 12:35.058
Oh. Or you and I do.

12:36.407 --> 12:38.409
Okay.

12:38.453 --> 12:40.020
So, what brings you by?

12:40.063 --> 12:41.586
And just so you know,

12:41.630 --> 12:44.328
I'’ve already pressed
nine-one on my phone.

12:44.372 --> 12:46.548
Relax. If I wanted
to rough you up,

12:46.591 --> 12:48.202
I would have waited inside.

12:48.245 --> 12:50.465
You'’ve got great taste
in furniture, by the way.

12:50.508 --> 12:53.033
[chuckles]
You broke in?

12:53.076 --> 12:55.078
I had to tinkle.

12:55.122 --> 12:56.340
And we need to talk.

12:56.384 --> 12:58.255
I have nothing to say to you.

12:58.299 --> 12:59.953
I just want to know if you'’re
trying to get back with Adam.

12:59.996 --> 13:02.216
That is really
none of your business.

13:02.259 --> 13:03.565
So, yes.

13:03.608 --> 13:05.393
Okay, are we done?

13:05.436 --> 13:08.744
Oh, we'’re just getting started.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.964
Actually, I only have
one more question,

13:11.007 --> 13:12.704
so, yeah, we'’re almost done.

13:14.445 --> 13:17.361
Why'’d you two break up?Why don'’t you ask him?

13:17.405 --> 13:19.842
Because I respect the boundaries
of people I care about.

13:19.886 --> 13:22.279
You just broke into my house.

13:22.323 --> 13:24.325
I don'’t care about you.

13:24.368 --> 13:26.544
Wow.

13:26.588 --> 13:29.112
You really love him, don'’t you?

13:29.156 --> 13:31.114
Of course I do.
Why else would I risk

13:31.158 --> 13:33.943
squeezing through your doggy
door with a full bladder?

13:33.987 --> 13:37.512
It is possible
that you'’re just insane.

13:37.555 --> 13:39.383
It is. Keep that in mind.

13:41.472 --> 13:43.431
So, what happened?
He cheat on you?

13:43.474 --> 13:44.519
No.

13:44.562 --> 13:46.521
You cheat on him?

13:46.564 --> 13:48.044
What did he tell you?

13:48.088 --> 13:49.480
Not as much as
you just did.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.615
Okay, noware we done?

13:53.658 --> 13:55.660
Almost. Just to keep
things on the up and up,

13:55.704 --> 13:57.445
here'’s a dollar.

13:57.488 --> 13:59.577
While I was waiting, I made
myself an English muffin.

14:04.887 --> 14:08.021
Oh, God help me, I like her.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.636
Hey, where you been?

14:14.679 --> 14:16.507
I went to see
Adam'’s ex-wife.

14:16.551 --> 14:17.944
I'’m out.

14:17.987 --> 14:19.989
Calm down. Nobody got hurt.

14:20.033 --> 14:21.643
What happened?

14:21.686 --> 14:23.950
She cheated on him.
That'’s why they broke up.

14:23.993 --> 14:25.865
Oh, God.
Mm-hmm.

14:25.908 --> 14:27.910
And I'’m thinking
that'’s why he flipped out

14:27.954 --> 14:29.390
when that guy kissed me.

14:29.433 --> 14:31.174
Makes sense.

14:31.218 --> 14:33.394
She trying to get
back together with him?

14:33.437 --> 14:34.874
Oh, yeah.

14:34.917 --> 14:37.267
Explains why she hasn'’t signed
the divorce papers.

14:37.311 --> 14:39.052
But she'’ll watch her step.

14:39.095 --> 14:42.446
She knows that I know where
she keeps her English muffins.

14:42.490 --> 14:45.580
I'’m sorry. What?

14:45.623 --> 14:47.669
[sighs][phone chimes]

14:47.712 --> 14:49.497
Hang on.

14:49.540 --> 14:51.107
It'’s Adam.

14:51.151 --> 14:53.327
"Come outside.
Bring a bowl of water."

14:53.370 --> 14:54.937
What does that mean?

14:54.981 --> 14:56.983
What does
"English muffins" mean?

14:58.723 --> 15:01.204
And why did you have
my thumb in your mouth?

15:07.210 --> 15:08.777
Oh.

15:08.820 --> 15:11.736
I thought it was about time
you two met.

15:11.780 --> 15:14.826
Samson, this is the crazy
woman I was telling you about.

15:16.306 --> 15:18.004
Hello, Samson.

15:18.047 --> 15:20.267
Here you go.

15:20.310 --> 15:22.617
Oh. He'’s so sweet.

15:22.660 --> 15:24.358
Yeah, he sure is.

15:24.401 --> 15:26.403
We'’ve been buddies
for about 14 years.

15:26.447 --> 15:29.798
Wow. So he'’s, like,
800 in dog years?

15:29.841 --> 15:32.409
[laughs]
Something like that.

15:32.453 --> 15:34.150
When I ended up in this chair,

15:34.194 --> 15:37.327
he was the only one that
didn'’t look at me differently.

15:37.371 --> 15:40.765
Breaks my heart that I
can'’t take care of him now.

15:40.809 --> 15:43.551
I get it.

15:43.594 --> 15:47.033
We were about to go
on a very slow walk.

15:48.164 --> 15:49.687
Maybe you'’d like to come?

15:49.731 --> 15:51.559
I'’d be honored.

15:54.649 --> 15:56.781
Well, hang on, let him finish.

15:56.825 --> 15:58.479
[sighs]

15:58.522 --> 16:02.135
You know, I used to
drink vodka like that.

16:02.178 --> 16:05.181
That fast?No, lying on the floor
out of a bowl.

16:06.878 --> 16:07.967
Hmm.

16:08.010 --> 16:09.446
All right,
I'’m cutting you off.

16:09.490 --> 16:11.144
[chuckles]:
Yeah, come on, boy.

16:11.187 --> 16:13.146
Come on. Come on.

16:13.189 --> 16:15.148
Oh, by the way,
next time you think

16:15.191 --> 16:17.150
of surprising my
ex-wife, keep in mind

16:17.193 --> 16:19.456
that she was a small-arms
instructor in the Army.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.241
Ha-ha, very funny.Not a joke.

16:21.284 --> 16:24.244
She can shoot a cigarette
out of your mouth at 50 feet.

16:24.287 --> 16:27.073
Really?That'’s how she got
me to quit smoking.

16:38.519 --> 16:42.436
When you said slow walk,
you weren'’t kidding.

16:42.479 --> 16:46.048
Yeah, the leash is really
a formality at this point.

16:46.092 --> 16:48.224
So, how'’d you guys meet?

16:48.268 --> 16:51.532
Actually, I found him in a
box on the side of the road.

16:51.575 --> 16:52.924
He was just a puppy.

16:52.968 --> 16:55.927
Aw, so you rescued him?

16:55.971 --> 16:58.365
Mm, he kind of rescued me.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.849
Okay, I think
we'’re done walking.

17:05.894 --> 17:07.156
So, what do we do?

17:07.200 --> 17:08.853
We hang out till he gets up.

17:10.159 --> 17:12.074
Sounds good.

17:12.117 --> 17:13.641
Ooh.

17:13.684 --> 17:15.077
[chuckles]

17:15.121 --> 17:16.512
I think he likes me.

17:16.557 --> 17:18.079
I think he likes you, too.

17:20.734 --> 17:25.000
You know, if you wanted to spend
a little more time with him,

17:25.044 --> 17:27.307
he could stay with me
every now and then.

17:27.349 --> 17:29.483
You sure about that?
He'’s a lot of work.

17:29.526 --> 17:30.875
He'’s got arthritis,

17:30.919 --> 17:32.660
he'’s incontinent,
he'’s half-deaf.

17:32.703 --> 17:35.532
That'’s okay. I promised Christy
a dog about 30 years ago.

17:35.576 --> 17:36.794
I hate to disappoint her.

17:36.838 --> 17:38.840
So this has nothing to do

17:38.883 --> 17:41.060
with keeping me away
from Danielle?

17:41.103 --> 17:42.887
Oh, please.

17:42.931 --> 17:45.412
Who'’s your new mommy?

17:45.455 --> 17:47.936
I'’m your new mommy.

17:47.979 --> 17:49.720
Can you hear me?
