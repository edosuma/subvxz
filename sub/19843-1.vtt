02:45.290 --> 02:46.860
Doesn't matter.

02:47.080 --> 02:49.321
Uh, I'm here to see Harold Meachum.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.831
I'm sorry, that's not possible.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.628
I'm Danny Rand. The son of Wendell Rand.

02:56.050 --> 02:57.711
I've, uh, been away a long time.

02:58.010 --> 02:59.921
And you're here to see Harold Meachum?

03:00.130 --> 03:01.210
Yeah.

03:01.390 --> 03:02.926
- One minute, please.
- Okay.

03:05.100 --> 03:07.921
I used to ride my skateboard
around in here.

03:09.100 --> 03:10.636
Someone will be right out to see you.

03:10.810 --> 03:12.050
- Oh, thanks.
- Mm.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.181
Welcome to Rand Enterprises.

Touch the Interactive screen to access the
company d/recto/y.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.487
Whoa. This is new.

03:47.850 --> 03:49.477
- Let's go. You don't belong here.
- Oh, wait.

03:49.640 --> 03:51.301
- Uh, I... I'm Danny Rand.
- Now.

03:51.480 --> 03:53.220
- Come on, guys. Just call Harold.
- You're out of here.

04:09.910 --> 04:11.366
Whoa. Whoa! Hold him.

04:11.580 --> 04:12.990
- Guys, I just want to talk to Harold.
- Dude...

04:13.170 --> 04:14.239
- Come on.
- No.

04:21.010 --> 04:22.875
Hey!

05:38.080 --> 05:39.069
Excuse me.

05:40.670 --> 05:41.830
Excuse me!

05:47.760 --> 05:49.421
- Who are you?
- Where's Harold?

05:50.510 --> 05:52.421
Excuse me? Who are you?

05:55.310 --> 05:56.470
Oh...

05:57.810 --> 05:58.799
Ward?

06:01.480 --> 06:03.311
Joy?

06:05.360 --> 06:06.600
It's Danny.

06:07.780 --> 06:08.656
Danny Rand.

06:12.530 --> 06:14.157
How did you get up here?

06:14.330 --> 06:15.695
The elevator. I, uh...

06:15.870 --> 06:17.110
I came to see your father.

06:17.290 --> 06:19.872
Look,
but I think you're in the wrong place.

06:20.040 --> 06:21.996
No, this is definitely the right place.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.291
I'm sorry, but I'm calling security.

06:25.460 --> 06:28.122
- They can help you.
- Wait, no. It's me.

06:28.300 --> 06:31.633
Look, I know it sounds crazy, but let me
just talk to your dad, okay?

06:32.140 --> 06:33.596
Then I can leave you guys alone.

06:34.970 --> 06:37.723
I'm afraid Harold Meachum is dead.

06:38.270 --> 06:39.259
What?

06:40.900 --> 06:43.391
I... I didn't know. When?

06:44.570 --> 06:47.312
Why isn't anyone picking up?
Can you get security up here?

06:49.660 --> 06:52.276
He died of cancer 12 years ago.

06:55.490 --> 06:56.536
I'm sorry to hear that.

06:58.500 --> 06:59.865
All our parents are gone now.

07:02.290 --> 07:05.339
Okay, well, thanks for dropping by.
I'm gonna show you...

07:05.500 --> 07:06.751
What? No, no, no.

07:06.920 --> 07:08.717
I guess I need to talk to you, then.

07:09.470 --> 07:11.836
What you need is to get out of my office.

07:12.850 --> 07:15.808
Look, uh, it's me. Seriously.

07:17.020 --> 07:19.136
Why don't we just all walk over
to the Stage Deli?

07:19.310 --> 07:22.188
We can have a cup of tea.
We can talk about this.

07:22.940 --> 07:24.510
Stage Dell's been closed for years.

07:24.690 --> 07:27.477
It... It doesn't matter where we go, okay?

07:27.650 --> 07:28.810
I just want to talk.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.355
You are absolutely insane

07:30.530 --> 07:33.488
if you think I'm gonna sit down
and have a cup of tea with you.

07:33.660 --> 07:35.366
- Look, I know this is strange, but...
- Really?

07:35.530 --> 07:36.656
You think?

07:37.040 --> 07:38.996
Maybe, that's because Danny Rand is dead.

07:39.410 --> 07:42.163
Please, get out of here now.

07:42.330 --> 07:44.833
Ward... You need to calm down.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.206
Calm down?

07:46.380 --> 07:48.621
Are you seriously telling me to calm down?

07:48.800 --> 07:51.712
- Get out, or I will throw you out.
- Ward, you need to back off.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.336
Keep telling me what to do...

07:53.510 --> 07:55.717
All right. All right. Let's all calm down,
yeah?

07:55.890 --> 07:57.881
Look, whoever you are, I think it's best
if you leave...

07:58.060 --> 07:59.880
Look, I don't want to leave!

08:04.230 --> 08:05.857
I'm sorry.

08:06.020 --> 08:07.396
I... I didn't mean to...

08:08.570 --> 08:11.107
- Your last chance, buddy.
- Ward, wait.

08:14.990 --> 08:16.150
About time.

08:16.330 --> 08:18.230
Take this crazy piece of shit away.

08:18.410 --> 08:20.867
Look, it doesn't have to be like this,
okay? I'm not dangerous.

08:21.040 --> 08:22.246
He attacked the lobby guards.

08:22.410 --> 08:23.320
Senous?

08:23.500 --> 08:25.070
Blindsided our guards in the lobby.

08:25.250 --> 08:27.377
I'm calling the police. No.

08:27.540 --> 08:29.667
If he gets arrested,
he'll be out again in a few hours.

08:30.590 --> 08:32.581
If you set foot in this building again,

08:32.760 --> 08:35.081
our guards will take it
as a personal threat

08:35.260 --> 08:38.502
and will respond with whatever means
necessary.

08:38.720 --> 08:40.381
I think you know what that means.

08:40.560 --> 08:42.096
Look, Ward, don't do this.

08:42.270 --> 08:44.932
You're gonna feel real stupid once all
this is cleared up.

08:45.100 --> 08:46.351
Come on!

08:52.030 --> 08:54.237
- You okay?
- Yeah.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.480
Still...

08:56.280 --> 08:59.784
It's been, like, 15 years
since Danny and his parents died.

08:59.950 --> 09:01.406
And this guy just shows up out of nowhere?

09:02.790 --> 09:03.859
What?

09:07.790 --> 09:09.280
You know what's weirder?

09:10.630 --> 09:12.962
He looked like Danny. Right?

09:13.220 --> 09:14.118
Joy...

09:14.680 --> 09:16.329
I know. I know. It's crazy.
It's...

09:16.840 --> 09:18.592
- It's not Danny.
- It's not.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.482
Heather,
stay in your seat. Heather!

09:49.250 --> 09:51.332
I'm okay.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.411
I'm okay. Yeah, I... I'm good.

09:53.590 --> 09:54.830
I don't give a shit what you are.

09:56.760 --> 09:58.671
You know, you... You remind me of Billy.

09:58.840 --> 10:00.796
He was, uh...

10:00.970 --> 10:02.676
He was head of security when I left.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.841
Yeah. I guess he retired.

13:56.330 --> 13:58.161
One, two, three, four...

13:59.170 --> 14:01.240
Park Place. That’s m/ne.
You owe me money.

14:01.420 --> 14:03.081
Okay.

14:03.260 --> 14:04.875
Ward its your turn.

14:07.590 --> 14:11.094
One, two, three, four, five.

14:12.390 --> 14:15.348
Kentuclq Avenue.
Two-hundred and fifty bucks.

14:15.520 --> 14:16.418
I don't think so.

14:17.770 --> 14:20.147
- What do you mean, "I don't think so"?
- I don't wanna pay it.

14:20.440 --> 14:22.476
You have to. It's the rules.

14:23.570 --> 14:25.106
Dad says rules are for pussies.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.429
Hello!

14:26.610 --> 14:28.407
- Hey, everyone. We're home.
- We're up here.

14:30.530 --> 14:33.112
Oh, but here comes Mummy and Daddy
to protect you,

14:33.290 --> 14:35.076
and give you lots of hugs and kisses,

14:35.250 --> 14:37.150
and tell you what a sweet little boy you
are.

14:37.540 --> 14:38.700
It's disgusting.

14:39.540 --> 14:41.417
- Wa_rd.
- HI.

14:43.210 --> 14:44.450
What happened here?

14:44.630 --> 14:47.292
Danny's been kind of a problem.

16:25.980 --> 16:27.220
Hey.

16:28.400 --> 16:30.061
Hey!Uh".

16:30.240 --> 16:31.730
Uh, I didn't mean to spook you.

16:32.740 --> 16:34.401
It's all right. I, uh...

16:34.570 --> 16:35.901
I don't really spook.

16:37.240 --> 16:38.400
I'm Big Al.

16:40.160 --> 16:41.320
Danny.

16:42.750 --> 16:44.820
Don't think I've seen you
around here before.

16:45.750 --> 16:47.911
Uh, I've, uh...

16:48.090 --> 16:49.330
Been away a while.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.086
Traveller, huh?

16:53.010 --> 16:54.079
Yeah. Kinda.

16:55.340 --> 16:56.580
Nice iPod.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.920
I got an iPhone.

17:01.310 --> 17:02.299
Nice.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.727
You can find anything you want
on the Internet.

17:05.850 --> 17:07.511
- Yeah?
- Seriously, I...

17:08.440 --> 17:10.396
I found my sister living in Florida.

17:12.740 --> 17:13.775
Called her up.

17:14.700 --> 17:15.598
She's still a bitch.

17:18.580 --> 17:20.195
You want me to look someone up?

17:20.370 --> 17:22.190
Anybody.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.367
Before whoever owns this phone
cancels the service. Eh...

17:27.960 --> 17:30.121
Look up Danny Rand.

17:35.880 --> 17:36.881
Oh, yeah.

17:37.550 --> 17:40.132
There was a kid. I... I remember this.

17:40.890 --> 17:42.630
The whole family died in a plane crash.

17:43.600 --> 17:46.307
Very sad. Uh, is that the one
you're talking about?

17:47.480 --> 17:48.549
Yeah.

17:50.440 --> 17:51.509
Anybody else?

17:52.980 --> 17:54.060
Look up Harold Meachum.

17:58.950 --> 18:00.656
Oh, wow, another dead guy.

18:02.370 --> 18:03.496
Is that him?

18:06.250 --> 18:07.319
Thanks.

18:08.330 --> 18:10.992
Whoa, he had... He had a big funeral.

18:11.170 --> 18:12.831
Mayor and everything. Look at that.

18:13.380 --> 18:14.369
You know him?

18:15.670 --> 18:17.467
Yeah. Sort of.

18:22.010 --> 18:22.999
You know...

18:24.100 --> 18:26.591
You can get shoes
at the shelter on East 13th.

18:27.560 --> 18:30.358
Okay.
Just make sure you piss in 'em first.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.851
You know, they carry the bad juju
from the previous owner.

18:32.940 --> 18:34.817
Only way to get rid of 'em
is with your piss.

18:34.900 --> 18:38.142
Or... Or the blood of a she-goat.
Uh, that's hard to find around here.

18:41.870 --> 18:42.859
What?

18:43.030 --> 18:45.191
Oh, nothing. It's just, uh...

18:47.660 --> 18:51.699
I'm guessing people think
we're pretty much alike.

18:56.210 --> 18:58.212
- Special creatures.
- Yeah.

18:58.720 --> 18:59.618
Exactly.

19:25.200 --> 19:27.327
Hey, Joy! Joy, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

19:27.540 --> 19:28.996
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

19:29.160 --> 19:31.162
I've been waiting
to talk to you. It...

19:31.330 --> 19:32.991
It really is me.

19:33.330 --> 19:34.376
Okay.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.667
Oh, hey, come on. I... I promise,
I'm not gonna hurt you.

19:36.840 --> 19:38.751
Yeah, I know you're not, 'cause I'm
texting my driver right now,

19:38.920 --> 19:41.172
which means he's going to be pulling
around the corner any second

19:41.260 --> 19:42.750
and if you're still with me
when he gets here,

19:42.840 --> 19:44.046
I'm gonna ask him to detain you,

19:44.140 --> 19:46.005
because he's not just my driver,
he's also my guard.

19:46.100 --> 19:47.556
- My armed guard.
- Joy, hey...

19:47.720 --> 19:49.597
And I will make sure that you're arrested.

19:50.270 --> 19:52.261
And I will see _
that your case goes to trIal

19:52.440 --> 19:53.930
and that you are convicted
of malicious harassment

19:54.110 --> 19:55.566
and sent to jail for the maximum time.

19:55.730 --> 19:57.857
Joy, come on. Hey, look, it's...
We used to be friends.

19:58.070 --> 19:59.389
It's me.

19:59.570 --> 20:00.639
Daniel Thomas Rand.

20:01.110 --> 20:03.351
Born April lst, right here in Manhattan.

20:03.700 --> 20:06.658
We were on the same soccer team,
The Bombers.

20:06.830 --> 20:08.616
I played the goalie.

20:15.130 --> 20:16.745
Anyone could look that stuff up online.

20:18.090 --> 20:19.751
You... You're living in my house.

20:21.880 --> 20:24.633
- This is my house now.
- Yeah.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.631
Yeah, it seems that way.

20:26.800 --> 20:29.132
Your dog's pretty scary.

20:31.730 --> 20:32.970
Did you break in?

20:33.980 --> 20:36.892
My dog was closed in my study last night
when I got home.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.014
You did that?

20:38.190 --> 20:40.146
Now that is so not okay, my friend.

20:40.320 --> 20:41.776
Sorry, buddy...

21:52.390 --> 21:54.051
Thanks, but I, uh...

21:54.230 --> 21:55.549
I wasn't asking for money.

21:56.980 --> 21:58.186
Oh.

21:58.350 --> 22:00.898
Uh... Whatever.

22:06.320 --> 22:08.697
Wow. Is this you?

22:10.240 --> 22:11.229
Yeah.

22:11.410 --> 22:13.480
Cool. I'm Danny.

22:20.590 --> 22:21.875
Colleen Wing.

22:32.260 --> 22:34.808
Uh, speak English or Japanese.

22:35.270 --> 22:36.669
I haven't spoken Mandarin
since I was a kid.

22:36.890 --> 22:38.221
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

22:38.390 --> 22:41.769
Um... I was just wondering if...

22:41.940 --> 22:43.396
Maybe I could get a job with you.

22:45.940 --> 22:47.817
I've already got someone who cleans up.

22:49.070 --> 22:50.367
- No, wait. I meant...
- See ya.

22:58.290 --> 22:59.200
So...

23:01.130 --> 23:02.586
The guy is still around.

23:02.750 --> 23:05.412
- What guy?
- The Danny Rand wannabe.

23:06.420 --> 23:08.251
He was waiting outside my house
this morning.

23:08.420 --> 23:10.388
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. He never touched me.

23:10.590 --> 23:13.889
He just said he wanted to talk.
Same thing as before.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.300
But get this.

23:17.310 --> 23:19.972
I think he may have
broken into my house as well.

23:20.140 --> 23:21.141
Okay.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.470
That takes this to a whole other level.

23:25.650 --> 23:28.062
- This guy's dangerous.
- I know.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.730
I'm a little freaked.

23:29.990 --> 23:32.447
I'm gonna make sure Shannon has people
posted outside your place.

23:32.620 --> 23:34.986
There was another thing.

23:35.160 --> 23:36.821
So strange.

23:36.990 --> 23:37.991
What?

23:39.750 --> 23:42.878
He... He stepped out on to the street,

23:43.250 --> 23:44.581
right in front of a car...

23:45.550 --> 23:47.700
But then he just sort of put his hand out

23:47.880 --> 23:50.713
and jumped over it like it was nothing.

23:51.180 --> 23:52.886
So, great!

23:53.590 --> 23:55.592
He's an insane homeless acrobat.

23:55.760 --> 23:58.092
Call Cirque du Psychopath.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.977
Yeah. Yeah.

24:01.140 --> 24:02.687
Like I said, it was strange.

24:02.850 --> 24:04.101
Either way...

24:05.690 --> 24:07.681
We're gonna have to deal with this guy.

24:07.860 --> 24:09.430
I know it sounds crazy, but...

24:10.360 --> 24:12.601
Should we actually just talk to him?

24:12.780 --> 24:14.441
Why would we want to do that?

24:14.740 --> 24:18.528
Well, um, I'm just wondering
if there's any chance

24:18.700 --> 24:21.112
- it could actually be Danny.
- No.

24:21.460 --> 24:22.358
Joy...

24:23.580 --> 24:26.128
We went through this. Definitely not.

24:26.460 --> 24:32.000
This is either a crazy guy or...
It's some sort of setup.

24:32.260 --> 24:34.637
And if that's the case, he's really smart.

24:34.930 --> 24:36.670
He's playing on our emotions.

24:36.850 --> 24:37.805
Why?

24:38.010 --> 24:40.058
'Cause we lost a friend when Danny died.

24:40.270 --> 24:43.478
Wouldn't you love it
if somehow he was still alive,

24:43.640 --> 24:46.473
walked into our office all these years
later?

24:49.280 --> 24:50.520
I don't know.

24:51.320 --> 24:54.153
Or do you really think
the timing is coincidental?

24:54.490 --> 24:57.402
Right when we're about to announce
our expansion in China?

24:58.740 --> 24:59.616
Okay.

25:01.750 --> 25:06.198
_ Someone walks in
who potentially owns 51% of the company.

25:06.380 --> 25:08.166
Even if it's bogus, the perception...

25:08.380 --> 25:10.507
Is there's a leadership struggle.

25:10.800 --> 25:13.507
- And who gains from this?
- Our competition.

25:13.670 --> 25:15.080
It could be anyone.

25:17.260 --> 25:19.751
So you're thinking this is some sort of
corporate sabotage?

25:19.970 --> 25:22.177
Makes sense, doesn't it?

25:43.700 --> 25:45.201
Thank you, sir.

25:47.960 --> 25:49.166
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

25:49.250 --> 25:51.707
Ijust wanted to talk. I... I didn't know
any other way to get to you.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.290
No way.

25:53.460 --> 25:54.916
Stop. Stop!

26:00.470 --> 26:02.051
Sorry. I, uh...

26:02.140 --> 26:03.801
Haven't driven since my dad
put me on his lap

26:03.890 --> 26:05.687
and let me drive around our place
in the Hamptons.

26:05.890 --> 26:07.016
Stop the car now.

26:09.980 --> 26:12.938
- I said stop the car.
- Ward, I just need to talk.

26:16.400 --> 26:17.810
Pull over.

26:17.990 --> 26:19.400
Put the gun away.

26:19.570 --> 26:21.151
- Now.
- Look, I just want to talk, okay?

26:21.330 --> 26:23.901
You can talk to the police.
That's who you can talk to.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.039
I have been met with nothing but anger
and hostility since I've been home.

26:35.460 --> 26:38.122
And honestly...
It's kind of aggravating.

26:39.180 --> 26:41.717
So, I'm going to ask you one last time.

26:42.180 --> 26:45.923
Please... Put the gun away.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.645
Ah! Oh.

26:57.530 --> 26:59.020
How does it feel? Huh?

26:59.200 --> 27:00.690
Not so good.

27:03.160 --> 27:04.149
Bang!

27:09.540 --> 27:11.371
You will never get a penny from us.

27:13.540 --> 27:15.371
Who said anything about money?

27:15.550 --> 27:16.869
Then what do you want?

27:17.090 --> 27:18.375
I want answers.

27:18.630 --> 27:20.006
I want to know what happened.

27:20.180 --> 27:22.136
To me, to my parents...

27:22.390 --> 27:24.551
To the company that has my name on it!

27:25.510 --> 27:28.172
That's all you want? Answers?

27:29.560 --> 27:30.686
Yeah.

27:33.690 --> 27:35.226
I'll tell you everything I know.

27:35.400 --> 27:37.220
Okay.

27:38.150 --> 27:39.196
I'm listening.

27:42.660 --> 27:46.699
Wendell Rand, his wife Heather
and their son, Danny,

27:46.990 --> 27:49.572
died in a plane crash in the Himalayas.

27:51.330 --> 27:53.378
The plane was never found.

27:54.540 --> 27:56.588
Their bodies were never found.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.216
- Keep going.
- That's all I know.

28:02.390 --> 28:05.006
Oh, come on.
I know you know more.

28:05.220 --> 28:08.519
I was 15 when they died.
Why would I know anything more?

28:09.100 --> 28:10.931
And why do you think
that there's more to know?

28:11.100 --> 28:12.340
And why do you care?

28:12.520 --> 28:14.932
- Because you are not Danny Rand.
- Yes, I am.

28:15.110 --> 28:17.396
Show me a DNA test
that proves you're a Rand.

28:18.690 --> 28:21.193
- I have no living relatives.
- A fingerprint test.

28:22.240 --> 28:24.196
I... I was ten when we crashed.

28:24.530 --> 28:27.237
- I never had fingerprints taken.
- Then you've got nothing.

28:27.620 --> 28:29.611
Oh, man. You know what?

28:29.790 --> 28:32.281
You were a dick as a kid,
and you're still a dick now.

28:32.500 --> 28:35.458
- You don't know anything about me.
- No.

28:36.460 --> 28:40.089
You used to lock me in the freezer
at the Rand cafeteria.

28:41.260 --> 28:42.625
At one of the company picnics...

28:43.180 --> 28:45.796
You put a dead frog in my sandwich.

28:47.010 --> 28:50.639
You would kick me in the balls every
chance you had.

28:51.930 --> 28:53.181
This sound familiar?

28:58.730 --> 28:59.890
None of that is true.

29:00.480 --> 29:02.232
Yes, it is.

29:02.490 --> 29:05.982
I can only wonder what it's like inside
that crazy little head of yours.

29:08.330 --> 29:10.787
You wanna know what it's like? Hmm?

29:12.000 --> 29:13.615
It feels like this...

29:17.000 --> 29:19.332
When you're a ten-year-old boy
and you watch your mother die...

29:20.800 --> 29:23.621
And you know you and your father are next,
it feels like this!

29:27.260 --> 29:29.421
You're crazy. Yeah! Yeah, maybe.

29:30.600 --> 29:32.670
Stop this.

29:32.850 --> 29:34.010
Stop.

29:34.980 --> 29:35.969
Stop the car!

29:37.650 --> 29:38.639
Hold on, Danny!

29:38.810 --> 29:39.765
Oh, my God!

29:40.020 --> 29:41.772
Stop the car!

29:41.940 --> 29:43.931
Stop the car!

30:00.040 --> 30:01.701
I'm... I'm sorry. I...

30:02.670 --> 30:03.955
I... I didn't mean to...

30:04.920 --> 30:06.000
This isn't over.

30:08.390 --> 30:10.711
Oh... I know.

30:29.320 --> 30:30.560
I thought you might be hungry.

30:31.950 --> 30:33.486
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

30:35.620 --> 30:36.826
Chicken parm.

30:37.870 --> 30:39.280
The Italian deli on Bleecker.

30:39.750 --> 30:41.661
They throw 'em out
at the end of the night.

30:42.880 --> 30:45.166
Plenty of food if you know where to look.

30:46.220 --> 30:47.710
That's where it all went wrong.

30:50.720 --> 30:52.039
Where all what went wrong?

30:53.890 --> 30:55.130
All of mankind.

30:57.770 --> 30:58.930
It's true.

31:01.150 --> 31:02.890
For, like, a couple million years...

31:03.610 --> 31:05.430
We were all hunters and gatherers.

31:06.860 --> 31:08.270
Life was good.

31:10.030 --> 31:13.443
People grew strong and tall
and lived into their 705.

31:14.910 --> 31:16.241
Then, like, 10,000 years ago,

31:16.410 --> 31:18.617
they all got hit with the idiot stick
and decided to start...

31:20.120 --> 31:23.123
Farmin', build cities.

31:23.290 --> 31:24.291
And everything went to shit.

31:25.460 --> 31:26.757
- Yeah.
- Not me, though.

31:26.920 --> 31:28.581
No way, man.

31:28.760 --> 31:31.172
I'ma stay true to my purpose.

31:31.340 --> 31:33.092
I'm a... I'm a hunter-gatherer.

31:34.430 --> 31:35.556
You're lucky, then.

31:37.140 --> 31:40.018
Buddha said, "Your purpose in life
is to find your purpose."

31:42.150 --> 31:43.640
Sure, that makes sense.

31:44.230 --> 31:45.219
Yeah.

31:46.570 --> 31:47.855
What's your purpose?

31:52.450 --> 31:54.736
To protect K'un-Lun from all oppression.

31:56.120 --> 31:58.190
Honour the sacrifice
of Shou-Lao the Undying.

32:03.500 --> 32:04.740
Well, okay then.

32:09.970 --> 32:12.677
Just remember to have fun along the way.

32:13.590 --> 32:14.887
All right, man.

32:15.180 --> 32:17.091
- Thanks for the food.
- Yep.

32:34.240 --> 32:35.229
Great.

32:37.330 --> 32:39.230
Thank you, guys. That was a lovely class.

32:39.410 --> 32:41.071
Please take some flyers.

32:41.710 --> 32:44.201
Pass them around,
invite your friends to take a class.

32:44.330 --> 32:45.877
We need to get more students in here.

32:45.960 --> 32:46.870
Oh, also...

32:46.960 --> 32:50.293
Thursday nights will be closed
for AA meetings.

32:50.670 --> 32:52.126
They pay more than you do.

32:52.630 --> 32:54.291
Otherwise this place is closing.

33:09.150 --> 33:10.185
Hi.

33:11.650 --> 33:12.890
Here for a lesson?

33:14.360 --> 33:15.736
What can $2 get me?

33:17.870 --> 33:19.235
Cup of coffee down the street?

33:19.410 --> 33:21.696
Hmm. I never had coffee before.

33:23.500 --> 33:26.037
Or maybe a pair of flip-flops
at one of the stalls.

33:27.080 --> 33:28.240
Down the street.

33:28.880 --> 33:30.199
Oh. I'm, uh...

33:31.050 --> 33:32.085
I'm okay.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.712
So, you should probably... Go.

33:36.890 --> 33:38.380
I, uh...

33:38.930 --> 33:41.216
I want to challenge your master.

33:42.640 --> 33:43.629
You wanna what?

33:45.100 --> 33:46.556
It's protocol.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.686
I visit your dojo,
I need to challenge your master.

33:50.940 --> 33:52.771
Wow. Well, okay...

33:53.240 --> 33:55.777
But I'm the master,
and I don't accept your challenge.

33:56.740 --> 33:58.150
Oh. Okay, um...

33:58.320 --> 34:00.982
Yeah, look, I'm closing up, so...

34:01.620 --> 34:04.327
Do you, uh...
Do you teach kung fu lessons?

34:05.960 --> 34:07.575
- Nope.
- You should.

34:07.750 --> 34:09.456
You'd probably get more students.

34:10.420 --> 34:11.660
I don't need the hassle.

34:12.630 --> 34:14.120
I could teach a couple of classes.

34:14.590 --> 34:18.253
I mean, that's what I was asking
when I was talking about work.

34:18.640 --> 34:20.631
I'd be cheap. No hassle at all.

34:21.510 --> 34:22.716
Where'd you train?

34:23.970 --> 34:24.971
K'un-Lun.

34:25.890 --> 34:27.846
Which is... Where?

34:28.020 --> 34:29.339
You, uh...

34:30.400 --> 34:31.810
Can't really get there from here.

34:32.940 --> 34:34.771
Nice try.
Now it's time to go.

34:36.110 --> 34:38.817
Well, if you...
You really need to leave.

34:40.620 --> 34:42.440
This is just a practice sword.

34:43.200 --> 34:44.326
It doesn't even have an edge.

34:44.500 --> 34:45.489
Trust me...

34:46.160 --> 34:48.116
You don't wanna know_ what it feels like to
have a practice sword

34:48.290 --> 34:49.826
smack you hard on the side of the face.

34:51.710 --> 34:52.950
I already do.

34:53.920 --> 34:55.581
Ask Master Lei Kung the Thunderer.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.159
I'm asking you...

34:57.720 --> 34:59.176
nicely...

34:59.590 --> 35:01.000
one last time.

35:01.800 --> 35:02.960
Please go.

35:05.640 --> 35:07.631
I apologise for any inconvenience.

35:15.360 --> 35:16.395
Hey!

35:28.040 --> 35:29.075
Thanks.

35:59.740 --> 36:01.401
You're the security guard from Rand.

36:01.660 --> 36:02.945
Why are you...

36:03.280 --> 36:04.486
Ow!

36:13.710 --> 36:14.699
Go.

39:19.560 --> 39:20.549
Ow!

39:22.650 --> 39:23.685
Who sent you?

39:24.570 --> 39:25.639
Who sent you?

39:27.400 --> 39:28.389
Ward Meachum.

40:13.200 --> 40:14.519
Hello, Shannon.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.126
Thank you.

40:37.560 --> 40:39.016
We have a situation.

40:40.350 --> 40:42.557
Something that we need to discuss
in person.

40:44.860 --> 40:46.680
I think it can wait until the morning.

40:50.320 --> 40:51.389
Of course.

40:51.860 --> 40:53.020
Right away.

42:50.610 --> 42:51.816
Hi, Dad.

42:52.440 --> 42:54.522
The Chinese yuan is gonna drop.

42:54.940 --> 42:58.444
- It's gonna affect our expansion there.
- I'll take care of it.

42:58.860 --> 43:01.943
Oh, like you're taking care
of the Danny Rand situation?

43:02.830 --> 43:04.445
How do you even know about that?

43:06.160 --> 43:07.149
Shit.

43:07.500 --> 43:08.785
Are you behind this?

43:09.250 --> 43:11.161
Is this another one of your stupid tests?

43:11.330 --> 43:12.786
No, Ward, I'm not behind it.

43:13.590 --> 43:15.455
I wish you'd take things like this
more seriously,

43:15.630 --> 43:17.370
so that I don't see my company destroyed.

43:17.550 --> 43:20.462
- So it's your company now?
- It's always been my company.

43:20.640 --> 43:22.380
You know, I could just ignore you.

43:22.550 --> 43:24.461
There's not a thing you could do about it.

43:24.640 --> 43:27.268
Oh, sometimes you still sound
like you're an eight-year-old.

43:27.430 --> 43:29.091
Yeah, yeah, Dad.

43:29.390 --> 43:31.187
I get the whole disappointed in me thing.

43:31.350 --> 43:32.681
You've been doing it my whole life.

43:32.860 --> 43:34.976
I expect more of you. That's all.

43:37.690 --> 43:39.692
Is he here all the time now?

43:40.860 --> 43:42.316
How much does he know?

43:42.660 --> 43:44.867
- What does it matter?
- I think you know why it matters.

43:47.330 --> 43:49.616
Ward, try to learn from me.

43:49.960 --> 43:52.121
You hire people when they're young,
single,

43:52.290 --> 43:55.202
looking for something to commit to,
to build their lives around.

43:56.170 --> 43:58.081
Pay 'em twice what they're worth.

43:59.010 --> 44:00.546
It builds loyalty.

44:01.550 --> 44:03.131
It's something I learned from Wendell.

44:03.300 --> 44:04.176
Sure.

44:04.350 --> 44:05.214
Kyle.

44:09.390 --> 44:12.439
Hey, will you ever betray me, Kyle?

44:12.600 --> 44:13.851
No, sir.

44:14.690 --> 44:16.180
You're a good man, Kyle.

44:17.900 --> 44:19.891
Why don't you take
the rest of the day off?

44:20.950 --> 44:22.190
It's nearly midnight, sir.

44:22.360 --> 44:24.021
Aw, too late then, huh?

44:25.530 --> 44:27.236
See? He loves me.

44:28.950 --> 44:30.201
Jesus, Dad.

44:31.210 --> 44:33.701
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Never felt better.

44:35.250 --> 44:36.740
Of course.

44:39.880 --> 44:43.293
So... Let's talk about the real issue.

44:44.260 --> 44:46.592
This, uh, Danny Rand character.

44:46.760 --> 44:48.967
You tried to have Shannon handle it,
and that didn't work out so well.

44:49.140 --> 44:50.721
Apparently not.

44:50.890 --> 44:53.893
Hmm... So what's he saying?
What's his story?

44:54.600 --> 44:55.806
He sounds like a lunatic.

44:55.980 --> 44:57.356
I don't know what his story is.

44:57.650 --> 45:00.528
- You haven't talked to him?
- Well, no.

45:00.820 --> 45:02.640
I'm not gonna play his game.

45:08.240 --> 45:10.288
How the hell are we supposed
to deal with this guy

45:10.450 --> 45:11.610
if we don't know anything about him?

45:12.460 --> 45:14.246
Hey... Listen up.

45:14.500 --> 45:17.412
The first rule of war and business
IS to know your enemy.

45:17.590 --> 45:19.330
Yes, you've told me that,
but in this case...

45:19.500 --> 45:21.411
Have you considered this might be
someone hired

45:21.590 --> 45:24.332
to make us look bad
at a time we don't wanna look bad?

45:24.510 --> 45:26.466
Yes. Joy and I have been all through that.

45:26.640 --> 45:27.629
Yeah.

45:28.470 --> 45:33.260
Much trickier if this actually is young
Danny Rand come back to life.

45:34.810 --> 45:36.266
That's impossible.

45:37.900 --> 45:39.720
Stranger things have happened.

45:43.400 --> 45:44.560
If this is Danny...

45:44.740 --> 45:46.105
- Dad, come on.
- Think!

45:57.000 --> 45:59.127
If this is Danny...

46:00.500 --> 46:02.047
We can't let him go public.

46:02.590 --> 46:05.252
No. No, we cannot.

46:06.890 --> 46:09.882
Now, there are other questions
to consider as well.

46:11.810 --> 46:15.849
If he's still alive, does that mean
his parents are still alive?

46:16.640 --> 46:18.096
Who else knows he's alive?

46:18.400 --> 46:20.356
What does he know? Who has he told?

46:21.320 --> 46:23.641
How the hell did he learn martial arts?

46:26.320 --> 46:29.619
Why has he waited this long to show up?
Huh?

46:29.780 --> 46:33.329
And now that he's here...
What does he want?

46:34.500 --> 46:36.741
- I don't know.
- Neither do I.

46:36.920 --> 46:38.785
Which is why you can't just
send some idiot

46:38.960 --> 46:41.451
to beat the shit out of him. Understood?

46:42.920 --> 46:45.753
Now we need to approach this with finesse.

46:46.720 --> 46:48.585
Like the way you handle
everything in life?

46:48.760 --> 46:50.341
Don't be smart with me, Ward.

46:53.520 --> 46:54.669
Leave this to me.

46:55.560 --> 46:57.846
I'll tell you exactly what to do.

47:06.690 --> 47:08.692
Like always.

47:09.570 --> 47:10.776
Like always.

47:21.210 --> 47:23.121
Hey. Al, are you awake?

48:05.090 --> 48:07.502
"As long as the cycle of existence lasts,

48:08.970 --> 48:10.790
"may your happiness never decline.

48:14.510 --> 48:17.422
"May you attain the constant joy
of the bodhisattvas."

48:58.510 --> 49:00.637
How did you get in here?

49:01.810 --> 49:03.380
This was always my second home.

49:04.650 --> 49:05.799
I know all the ins and outs.

49:13.200 --> 49:14.849
Your brother tried
to have me killed last night.

49:15.910 --> 49:16.774
What?

49:17.370 --> 49:18.405
No.

49:19.700 --> 49:20.997
Can we finally talk?

49:24.500 --> 49:25.455
Okay.

49:25.960 --> 49:28.167
But... I have mace in my purse,

49:28.420 --> 49:30.160
and I can touch one button
and have a guard here.

49:32.720 --> 49:34.176
I'm not gonna hurt you.

49:40.430 --> 49:44.218
So... What makes you think
Ward tried to kill you?

49:44.390 --> 49:47.109
Which, by the way, sounds preposterous.

49:47.270 --> 49:49.181
Your security guy came after me.

49:50.110 --> 49:51.225
With two other guys.

49:52.190 --> 49:54.351
- With guns.
- Shannon?

49:55.200 --> 49:56.519
Are you sure?

49:56.700 --> 49:57.689
Mm.

49:58.570 --> 49:59.696
Very sure.

49:59.870 --> 50:01.735
Well, you seem to have gotten away.

50:02.250 --> 50:03.114
Yeah.

50:03.910 --> 50:04.899
This time.

50:06.540 --> 50:08.747
All right, even if Shannon did attack you,

50:08.920 --> 50:11.161
I have to believe
that it was something he...

50:11.420 --> 50:13.661
Might have instigated on his own.

50:14.420 --> 50:17.139
Either way, it...
Doesn't make a difference.

50:20.560 --> 50:21.458
You know...

50:21.930 --> 50:26.594
My brother's a very
black and white kind of guy.

50:27.480 --> 50:30.142
Something's either true... Or it isn't.

50:31.230 --> 50:34.028
I'm a little more... Open.

50:37.610 --> 50:38.565
Meaning?

50:41.950 --> 50:44.748
You look like Danny Rand.

50:45.250 --> 50:46.365
Danny Rand is dead.

50:48.250 --> 50:49.990
Maybe the truth is somewhere in between.

50:51.460 --> 50:55.044
"If you wish to see the truth...
Then hold no opinions."

50:57.970 --> 50:59.335
It's a Zen saying.

51:02.100 --> 51:03.089
Okay.

51:06.180 --> 51:08.592
So, then...

51:09.520 --> 51:10.930
I guess I should call you Danny?

51:11.110 --> 51:12.099
Yeah.

51:13.440 --> 51:14.429
Please.

51:14.820 --> 51:17.641
All right, Danny. You said you had some
questions for me.

51:18.610 --> 51:20.942
I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to answer
all of them, but...

51:21.120 --> 51:22.109
I'll do my best.

51:22.660 --> 51:25.993
I have a lot of questions, too.
Why don't you go first?

51:29.290 --> 51:32.874
It's... It's all kind of crazy.

51:34.210 --> 51:36.201
I don't even know where to start.

51:37.010 --> 51:39.001
Well, why don't you just start
at the beginning?

51:43.390 --> 51:44.675
We were in our jet.

51:46.220 --> 51:47.767
Flying over the Himalayas.

51:48.390 --> 51:52.474
Then... Things started to... To go bad.

51:53.360 --> 51:54.258
Okay.

51:55.020 --> 51:56.430
We were, uh...

51:57.030 --> 51:58.395
We were flying too low.

52:00.150 --> 52:04.405
And the... The plane...
It started to come apart and, uh...

52:08.250 --> 52:11.037
And, um...

52:15.500 --> 52:17.502
- And then?
- And, um...

52:20.340 --> 52:21.716
And then, uh...

52:40.400 --> 52:41.560
You...

52:43.700 --> 52:44.860
What?

52:47.200 --> 52:48.690
Why would you...

53:33.830 --> 53:35.878
Looks like he had
another one of those episodes.

53:36.130 --> 53:37.870
Better to let him sleep.

54:01.320 --> 54:02.435
It’s just turbulence.

54:02.530 --> 54:03.986
It’s gonna be okay, Danny.

54:04.490 --> 54:05.980
It’s gonna be okay/

54:07.530 --> 54:09.270
- Just hold on, Danny!
- Dad!

54:09.450 --> 54:10.326
Oh, my God!

54:10.490 --> 54:11.946
Heather, stay in your seat. Heather!

54:12.120 --> 54:13.439
Heather...

54:15.160 --> 54:16.661
We got you, Danny.

54:23.670 --> 54:25.046
Mum!

54:25.220 --> 54:26.255
Heather!

54:28.010 --> 54:29.341
I love you, Danny.

54:41.520 --> 54:43.647
Ain ’t nobody dope as me

54:43.820 --> 54:45.526
I’m dressed so fresh, so clean

54:45.700 --> 54:46.769
50 fresh and so clean, clean

54:47.150 --> 54:49.368
Don ’1' you think I’m so sew

54:49.530 --> 54:51.191
I’m dressed so fresh, so clean

54:51.370 --> 54:52.826
50 fresh and so clean, clean
