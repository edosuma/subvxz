00:01.387 --> 00:03.520
Bloodshed follows bloodshed !

00:03.924 --> 00:05.000
Rosa !

00:07.720 --> 00:08.920
What's going on ?

00:10.280 --> 00:11.840
It was the cartel, wasn't it ?

00:12.200 --> 00:13.960
One of our children lies dead.

00:14.040 --> 00:17.360
We cannot simple stand by
and allow it to happen to another.

00:17.440 --> 00:19.744
This is for you.
I didn't see who dropped it off.

00:23.311 --> 00:25.622
- Who's coming ?
- Dead man.

00:30.080 --> 00:33.175
So we stand with you,
whatever may come.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.360
We need to warn them.
Give them a chance to leave.

00:38.720 --> 00:40.040
Why don't we call in the Feds ?

00:40.282 --> 00:41.400
You should go.

00:41.834 --> 00:43.040
Nothing's worth this.

00:43.120 --> 00:46.120
When I die, the last thing
I want to see

00:46.200 --> 00:49.840
is the face of every
man I have killed.

02:47.741 --> 02:53.100
TIN STAR

04:03.860 --> 04:05.980
We have to go.

06:43.740 --> 06:45.020
God is good.

06:46.020 --> 06:47.900
And all powerful,

06:49.140 --> 06:52.020
a rock in a troubled sea.

06:56.100 --> 07:00.260
God is just and protects
those who believe.

07:02.540 --> 07:04.260
He sees all

07:05.900 --> 07:08.220
but he forgets nothing.

07:09.240 --> 07:11.580
God is slow to anger

07:13.260 --> 07:16.980
but his love knows no end.

07:19.180 --> 07:23.260
But those who would make
an enemy of the Lord,

07:25.540 --> 07:28.740
he will pursue into the dark realm.

07:31.060 --> 07:33.300
He is fury,

07:34.380 --> 07:38.700
he is wrath, he is vengeance

07:40.060 --> 07:44.180
and affliction shall not
rise up a second time.

07:45.400 --> 07:50.380
And the righteous shall rejoice
when they see the vengeance.

07:51.020 --> 07:53.980
And he will bathe his feet

07:56.340 --> 07:59.340
in the blood of the wicked.

08:13.340 --> 08:15.300
We should go find your dad.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.660
What's the plan ?

08:25.100 --> 08:28.860
Let's be honest, dad doesn't give
a shit about these people.

08:28.940 --> 08:31.900
Why are we still here ?
Hanging around ?

08:34.140 --> 08:36.900
Will you sit down with me
for a minute.

08:36.980 --> 08:39.340
Mum...

08:42.179 --> 08:44.460
You're scaring me.

08:54.500 --> 08:57.780
- That's you.
- Tiny.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.940
The man holding you there

09:05.940 --> 09:08.180
is your father.

09:09.980 --> 09:11.220
That's not dad.

09:21.020 --> 09:23.660
This is a joke, right ?

09:24.500 --> 09:26.900
No, it's not a joke.

09:30.420 --> 09:33.860
- You're not my dad ?
- No.

09:38.780 --> 09:42.700
I know this is a shock. I always
imagined I'd tell you so differently.

09:43.420 --> 09:44.460
But...

09:44.540 --> 09:48.180
Your real dad,
he was a bit of a criminal.

09:55.140 --> 09:58.940
But the people he and Jack
worked with...

09:59.020 --> 10:02.140
- They're coming after us.
- Why ?

10:02.820 --> 10:07.740
Because of something we did.
Me and Jack. What we saw.

10:09.220 --> 10:11.500
Some of the stuff that we know.
It could hurt them.

10:11.580 --> 10:14.780
Wait, just wait. Damn.

10:21.460 --> 10:25.220
I don't get it.
So this is not about a cartel ?

10:26.100 --> 10:27.940
No.

10:28.940 --> 10:33.300
This is about you and you and me.

10:34.060 --> 10:35.900
Yes.

10:36.900 --> 10:38.940
And this all so difficult,

10:39.020 --> 10:43.460
but I need you to know that you were
always wanted and always loved.

10:44.980 --> 10:46.580
Yeah.

10:50.820 --> 10:53.900
But you're my mum ?
You are my real mum ?

10:53.980 --> 10:58.220
- Because if you tell me you're not I...
- I am your mother, darling girl.

10:58.300 --> 11:02.460
I carried you inside me.
I brought you into this world.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.460
Okay.

12:28.860 --> 12:30.940
I'm so sorry.

12:31.660 --> 12:33.540
She brought you to us,

12:35.340 --> 12:37.740
you became a part of our family.

12:38.860 --> 12:40.740
Yeah.

12:40.820 --> 12:44.340
- I loved her.
- I let her down.

12:46.500 --> 12:49.900
I sent her away without her
knowing the truth.

12:49.980 --> 12:52.780
With no way to protect herself.

12:56.660 --> 12:59.220
She never said goodbye to me.

12:59.860 --> 13:02.380
You have to forgive yourself.

13:02.460 --> 13:05.380
Perhaps if I'd been more
like your father

13:05.460 --> 13:08.700
my daughter would be alive today.

13:08.780 --> 13:11.580
I won't make that mistake again.

13:15.380 --> 13:18.460
He's not my father.

13:19.700 --> 13:21.500
What do you mean ?

13:25.580 --> 13:29.820
He's not my real dad.
Jack. I just found out.

13:33.060 --> 13:35.060
He loves you.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.340
You belong together.

13:38.660 --> 13:40.980
Have faith in that.

13:44.740 --> 13:47.860
- You should leave.
- No.

13:52.580 --> 13:55.020
No, I'm staying, Anna.

13:55.980 --> 13:59.660
I'll kill every man responsible
for my daughter's death.

14:01.020 --> 14:03.500
And I'm at peace with that.

14:23.860 --> 14:26.860
Collen, Jess,

14:27.940 --> 14:30.620
still packing, I see.

14:30.700 --> 14:33.540
- You got my back, right ?
- Yeah.

14:33.620 --> 14:36.380
Now we're fucking talking.

14:39.340 --> 14:43.180
- I stand with you.
- Well, that's a relief.

14:45.380 --> 14:49.980
You need a fucking shave mate.
Stop following me !

14:54.540 --> 14:58.380
Why now ? Why've you never
told me before ?

14:58.460 --> 15:01.260
Because he is a very dangerous man,
I didn't want you looking into him.

15:01.340 --> 15:02.780
He was a cunt, love.

15:04.420 --> 15:07.260
Your mum has very definite
taste in men.

15:08.980 --> 15:10.620
How did you meet him ?

15:10.820 --> 15:14.620
Working in a pub in Liverpool he owned.
I stayed upstairs.

15:16.740 --> 15:19.740
He ran a chain of pubs
we ran a racket out of.

15:19.820 --> 15:22.060
- We ?
- Yeah.

15:22.140 --> 15:25.460
There wasn't much money
to be had as a barmaid.

15:26.180 --> 15:28.540
So where's he now ? Prison ?

15:30.060 --> 15:32.820
No. He's dead.

15:34.420 --> 15:35.460
Dead ?

15:35.540 --> 15:37.260
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:39.180 --> 15:42.420
- How ?
- He was killed.

15:57.740 --> 16:00.140
So where do you fit into all of this ?

16:00.220 --> 16:02.940
- He was an informer.
- On pub scams ?

16:03.020 --> 16:05.180
No, it was a lot deeper than that.

16:06.420 --> 16:09.540
- Were you an informer ?
- No.

16:10.140 --> 16:12.980
And you two got together when ?

16:15.540 --> 16:18.100
That happened a bit later.

16:18.900 --> 16:22.380
But we went to London
cause we had to get you out.

16:22.460 --> 16:25.380
- So what about now ?
- Now they want us dead.

16:28.460 --> 16:32.060
We're going to do everything we can
to keep you safe, Anna.

16:33.180 --> 16:35.660
The people who are coming.
They're like you ? Aren't they ?

16:35.740 --> 16:37.460
Yeah.

16:38.140 --> 16:41.100
And you don't think
we can win this one, do you ?

16:52.620 --> 16:55.740
Don't, Johan. Don't.

16:55.820 --> 16:59.500
Don't say what you do
not mean. Please.

16:59.580 --> 17:03.660
- I did not mean to hurt you.
- But you do mean to harm. Don't you ?

17:03.740 --> 17:07.740
If you take this path,
there is no end to it. No end.

17:08.300 --> 17:09.420
You're becoming like them.

17:09.500 --> 17:14.060
I'm not asking you to walk the same
path as me. That's my choice.

17:14.740 --> 17:16.940
But you must take Thomas
and you must leave.

17:17.020 --> 17:20.020
- I must ?
- Yes.

17:20.099 --> 17:21.859
Where should we go ?
To Nelson ?

17:26.819 --> 17:29.940
- I love you.
- Then why are you asking me to leave ?

17:30.260 --> 17:33.380
- You're not safe if you stay here.
- I'm not safe if I go.

17:34.620 --> 17:38.460
My daughter's grave is here.
I'll never leave.

17:39.580 --> 17:42.460
Just as I'll never leave you.

17:56.540 --> 18:00.140
This might be my last chance
to say this.

18:01.460 --> 18:04.740
I don't care that you're not
my real dad.

18:04.820 --> 18:07.740
You're the only dad I've got.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.260
I don't want another one.

18:11.140 --> 18:13.460
I love you, dad.

18:17.140 --> 18:20.660
So we either live together
or we die together.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.740
Let the fuckers come.

18:45.199 --> 18:47.319
- You're a pickle.
- I thought I was a pickle.

18:47.399 --> 18:50.159
No, you're not the fucking pickle,
you're the ketchup.

18:50.239 --> 18:52.199
Pay attention.

18:52.639 --> 18:54.999
So, I think they'll take us
at the trailer.

18:55.079 --> 18:58.159
- How can you be sure ?
- I can't be.

18:58.239 --> 18:59.839
So we're splitting up ?

18:59.919 --> 19:02.559
Yeah, you get the low ground,
mum gets the high ground.

19:02.639 --> 19:04.719
What about you ?

19:05.799 --> 19:07.919
I'm the bun.

19:44.799 --> 19:46.959
Marry me.

19:50.719 --> 19:52.719
Nah.

19:55.279 --> 19:59.519
Then I'd be stuck with you.
I'd like to keep my options open.

20:07.559 --> 20:09.839
You used to beg me to marry you.

20:11.639 --> 20:12.879
I know.

20:13.599 --> 20:16.279
How many times ? Two, three ?

20:17.359 --> 20:20.359
Four actually.

20:22.679 --> 20:25.999
It's the last one stung
the most though.

20:38.799 --> 20:41.519
Don't know how to say goodbye.

20:44.719 --> 20:46.719
Then, don't.

21:21.399 --> 21:23.919
Go back to your room, Thomas.

22:53.919 --> 22:56.399
What do you reckon ?

22:56.479 --> 22:59.119
I think she's stronger
than either of us.

23:57.519 --> 23:59.159
If it all goes wrong, right...

23:59.239 --> 24:04.719
No. If it goes wrong and we lose track
of each other and it goes fucking...

24:06.679 --> 24:08.959
Tits up.

24:12.799 --> 24:15.239
I'll see you in the pub.

24:22.319 --> 24:25.199
The usual seat,

24:25.839 --> 24:27.959
best view in the room.

24:28.279 --> 24:30.799
Liverpool ?

24:32.159 --> 24:36.159
Jesus, Jack,
you want to go back ?

24:36.239 --> 24:39.159
We have to, don't we ?
If I can't do it, you need to do it.

24:39.239 --> 24:42.119
So you need to do it.

24:46.119 --> 24:48.599
Names are in the bag.

25:00.879 --> 25:03.919
I'll have three pints on the bar.

25:06.279 --> 25:08.839
Get there before I finish them.

25:10.799 --> 25:13.679
- See you.
- Jack !

25:15.919 --> 25:18.039
Come here to me.

25:44.039 --> 25:45.879
See you.

29:34.200 --> 29:35.800
Thomas.

29:40.080 --> 29:42.800
Hey...

29:43.800 --> 29:45.240
What are you doing here ?

32:03.000 --> 32:05.400
Fuck off !

32:12.160 --> 32:14.120
Fuck.

32:44.760 --> 32:46.520
Look at me !

33:34.360 --> 33:35.880
Go !

33:46.440 --> 33:49.360
I'm gonna take this off
and put it on you.

33:49.880 --> 33:53.080
It's okay. Here.
Look at me. It's okay.

34:39.719 --> 34:41.800
Stay there.

34:42.760 --> 34:45.639
Okay, straight through
the tractors. Go !

34:51.280 --> 34:54.040
Okay, to the woods. Go !

35:03.960 --> 35:05.720
You alright, Jack ?

35:22.480 --> 35:26.560
Thomas, here, run.
Get out of here, run !

36:16.720 --> 36:19.160
Run ! Run, Anna !
