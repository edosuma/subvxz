WEBVTT

00:05.173 --> 00:07.075
IF SHE HADN'T GIVEN YOU
BACK THAT RING,

00:07.108 --> 00:09.043
YOU'D BE MARRIED
TO HER RIGHT NOW.

00:09.077 --> 00:10.444
POSSIBLY.

00:10.478 --> 00:12.646
PUT YOUR ARM AROUND ME.

00:14.148 --> 00:16.484
Hanna: NICE WORK.
Caleb: IT WAS EASY.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.086
WELL, I'M NOT.

00:18.119 --> 00:19.820
Spencer: I'LL BE BACK
FOR IT ON MONDAY.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.323
AS SOON AS THE BANKS OPEN,
I'LL HAVE THE CASH.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.092
HERE YOU GO.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.659
IS THIS SOME KIND
OF A JOKE?

00:25.693 --> 00:26.727
I-I BROUGHT IN A RING.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.596
NOT ACCORDING
TO THE TICKET.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.631
SOMEBODY BROKE
INTO OUR GARAGE?

00:30.664 --> 00:33.767
DID THEY GET INTO THE HOUSE?
IS ANYTHING ELSE MISSING?

00:33.801 --> 00:36.470
( Aria screams, groans )

00:39.807 --> 00:41.575
LOOKING FOR SOMEONE?

00:41.609 --> 00:44.312
NO. I THOUGHT THAT
YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE
LIVING HERE.

00:44.345 --> 00:45.613
I AM.

00:45.646 --> 00:48.582
( Melissa screams )
Spencer: MELISSA!

00:48.616 --> 00:50.451
( sobbing )

01:02.796 --> 01:05.498
Aria: IS THIS A SUICIDE
NOTE OR A CONFESSION?

01:06.667 --> 01:08.068
Spencer: IT'S BOTH.

01:10.171 --> 01:12.740
EMILY...
HOW DO YOU HAVE THIS?

01:12.773 --> 01:14.475
I SENT IT TO HER.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.544
I TOOK A PICTURE
WITH MY PHONE BEFORE
WE CALLED THE COPS.

01:16.577 --> 01:19.113
IT'S WEIRD-- WHY WOULD
IAN KILL HIMSELF

01:19.147 --> 01:21.115
JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT
TO SKIP TOWN WITH MELISSA?

01:21.149 --> 01:22.883
MAYBE HE REALIZED
HE WAS GONNA GET CAUGHT.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.418
HE COULDN'T HIDE FOREVER,

01:24.452 --> 01:26.120
EVEN WITH MELISSA
AND WREN'S HELP.

01:26.154 --> 01:27.521
HE WAS PROBABLY DESPERATE.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.257
LOOK, WHO CARES
WHY IAN DID IT?

01:29.290 --> 01:31.325
THE IMPORTANT THING IS,
ALI'S KILLER IS DEAD

01:31.359 --> 01:33.461
AND WE'RE NO LONGER
PEOPLE OF INTEREST.

01:33.494 --> 01:35.363
WHY AM I NOT FEELING
RELIEVED RIGHT NOW?

01:35.396 --> 01:36.764
OH, EM, COME ON.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.266
FOR MONTHS, WE'VE BEEN
ABOUT AS WELCOME

01:38.299 --> 01:40.134
IN THIS TOWN
AS A COLD SORE,

01:40.168 --> 01:43.237
AND PLUS, NOW PEOPLE
KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN
TELLING THE TRUTH.

01:43.271 --> 01:45.506
AND IAN IS OUT OF
OUR LIVES FOR GOOD.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.841
YEAH... BUT "A" ISN'T.

01:47.875 --> 01:50.244
CAN WE PLEASE JUST SLAY
ONE DRAGON AT A TIME?

01:56.417 --> 01:58.252
HEY.
HEY.

01:58.286 --> 01:59.520
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

01:59.553 --> 02:01.222
I JUST CAME TO RETURN
SOME EVIDENCE

02:01.255 --> 02:03.157
WE TOOK FROM
THE FIELD HOCKEY OFFICE.

02:03.191 --> 02:05.693
HEY, UM, LOOK,
I JUST WANTED TO SAY

02:05.726 --> 02:07.861
THAT I'M SORRY YOU ALL
HAD TO BE THE ONES

02:07.895 --> 02:09.330
WHO FOUND HIM.

02:09.363 --> 02:11.165
MELISSA'S
THE ONE WHO FOUND HIM.

02:11.199 --> 02:13.934
I'M SORRY. THEN AGAIN,
COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE.

02:13.967 --> 02:18.272
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
BODIES DECAY. HE'D BEEN
DEAD AT LEAST A WEEK.

02:18.306 --> 02:19.840
GIVE MY BEST TO YOUR FAMILY.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.275
YEAH.

02:22.610 --> 02:24.445
A week?!

02:24.478 --> 02:27.715
No, that's impossible.
He was texting Melissa.

02:27.748 --> 02:30.951
No, he wasn't.
I'm betting it was "A."

02:30.984 --> 02:32.820
Why would "A"
pretend to be Ian

02:32.853 --> 02:34.755
and then lead us
there to his body?

02:34.788 --> 02:36.324
Does it matter?

02:36.357 --> 02:38.592
The guy was scum,
and now he's dead scum.

02:38.626 --> 02:40.294
Who cares if "A"
found him first?

02:40.328 --> 02:42.296
What does "A" want?

02:42.330 --> 02:43.597
You know what I want?

02:43.631 --> 02:45.899
I want to enjoy
my life again...

02:45.933 --> 02:48.802
before "A" finds
another way to ruin it.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.443
ARE YOU COMING?

02:55.476 --> 02:57.211
NO, YOU GUYS GO AHEAD.

02:57.245 --> 02:58.346
EM, WHAT IS IT?

02:58.379 --> 03:01.449
WE NOW KNOW "A"
IS INVOLVED.

03:01.482 --> 03:02.916
DOESN'T THAT
MAKE YOU NERVOUS?

03:02.950 --> 03:04.918
YEAH...

03:04.952 --> 03:07.388
BUT NOT AS MUCH
AS IAN DID.

03:07.421 --> 03:10.324
COULD WE JUST PLEASE
TAKE A BREAK FROM LOOKING
OVER OUR SHOULDER?

03:32.646 --> 03:34.915
( text message
indicator plinks )

03:42.523 --> 03:44.525
( school bell rings )

03:49.963 --> 03:52.366
* GOT A SECRET,
 CAN YOU KEEP IT *

03:52.400 --> 03:54.768
* SWEAR THIS ONE
 YOU'LL SAVE *

03:54.802 --> 03:57.405
* BETTER LOCK IT
 IN YOUR POCKET *

03:57.438 --> 03:59.740
* TAKIN' THIS ONE
 TO THE GRAVE *

03:59.773 --> 04:01.942
* IF I SHOW YOU
 THEN I KNOW YOU *

04:01.975 --> 04:04.812
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID

04:04.845 --> 04:09.650
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN KEEP A SECRET
 IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD *

04:12.353 --> 04:13.721
WELL, THANKS FOR
CALLING, JESS.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.856
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.991
OH, WE'RE HANGING IN THERE.

04:18.024 --> 04:21.894
( sighs ) YEAH.
OKAY, I WILL. BYE.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.897
( cell phone rings )

04:25.433 --> 04:27.468
ARE YOU GONNA ANSWER THAT?

04:27.501 --> 04:30.738
( phone beeps )

04:30.771 --> 04:33.374
REPORTERS HAVE BEEN
CALLING ALL DAY.

04:33.407 --> 04:35.676
( cell phone rings )

04:39.913 --> 04:42.583
LISTEN, YOU BOTTOM-
FEEDING VULTURES,

04:42.616 --> 04:45.453
STOP SUCKING THE LIFE
OUT OF MY FAMILY.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.890
OH, I'M SO SORRY,
GRANDMA.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.892
LET-- LET ME
GIVE HER TO YOU.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.894
HI, MA.

04:53.927 --> 04:55.896
YEAH, I KNOW.
IT'S CRAZY HERE.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.665
LET ME CALL YOU BACK,
OKAY?

04:57.698 --> 04:59.600
DID YOU REACH SOMEBODY?

04:59.633 --> 05:00.901
IT WASN'T EASY.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.637
FINALLY GOT AHOLD
OF HIS AUNT.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.339
SHE WANTS NOTHING
TO DO WITH US.

05:05.373 --> 05:07.341
MEANING WHAT, EXACTLY?

05:07.375 --> 05:09.477
MEANING SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO GIVE HIM A FUNERAL.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.345
SO WHAT NOW?

05:11.379 --> 05:13.547
WE'RE RESPONSIBLE
FOR BURYING HIM?

05:15.048 --> 05:17.351
LET'S JUST-- LET'S TALK
ABOUT THIS LATER.

05:17.385 --> 05:19.520
OH, NO, NO, NO.
VERONICA, WE CAN'T
PUT THIS OFF.

05:19.553 --> 05:20.854
WHAT OPTIONS DO WE HAVE?

05:20.888 --> 05:22.523
WE CAN TURN HIM OVER
TO THE COUNTY!

05:22.556 --> 05:25.859
I-I THINK... WE NEED
TO GIVE HIM A FUNERAL.

05:27.127 --> 05:29.730
IT'S THE RIGHT THING
TO DO.

05:29.763 --> 05:32.933
SWEETIE, NO ONE EXPECTS US
TO GIVE HIM A FUNERAL.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.802
WE'LL REGRET IT
IF WE DON'T.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.404
PLEASE.

05:36.437 --> 05:37.905
I THINK SHE NEEDS THIS.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.710
LET US THINK
ABOUT IT, OKAY?

05:46.580 --> 05:47.848
DO YOU WANT ICE?

05:47.881 --> 05:48.949
SURE.

05:51.719 --> 05:54.455
UH... WE DON'T HAVE ANY?
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

05:54.488 --> 05:56.356
DO YOU HAVE ANY FOOD?

05:57.458 --> 05:58.759
NO.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.094
THAT'S... ON THE LIST TOO,

06:01.128 --> 06:02.630
AFTER ICE.

06:02.663 --> 06:05.699
MY MOM'S BEEN
TOO BUSY TO SHOP.

06:05.733 --> 06:08.669
SO, WHY ARE YOU HERE,
ANYWAY?

06:08.702 --> 06:11.439
WELL, I HEARD WHAT
HAPPENED, AND I JUST...

06:11.472 --> 06:13.574
WANTED TO SEE
HOW YOU WERE HOLDING UP.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.676
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHECK
IN ON ME ANYMORE, OKAY?

06:15.709 --> 06:18.045
ONE FAKE DATE DOES NOT
A RELATIONSHIP MAKE.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.553
WAIT. I'M SORRY.

06:25.586 --> 06:26.987
IT'S JUST...

06:27.020 --> 06:28.989
IT'S BEEN A STRESSFUL
COUPLE OF DAYS.

06:32.760 --> 06:36.597
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ONE?

06:36.630 --> 06:38.466
A DEAD BODY, I MEAN.

06:38.499 --> 06:39.933
YEAH.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.472
HANNA?

06:44.505 --> 06:46.006
YEAH, I'M IN HERE.

06:46.039 --> 06:47.441
WHY DIDN'T YOU ANSWER
YOUR PHONE?

06:47.475 --> 06:49.176
IT'S OFF.
I'M CHARGING IT.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.711
I LEFT MESSAGES.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.145
'BOUT WHAT?

06:52.179 --> 06:53.647
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

06:53.681 --> 06:54.982
WHEN I CALL,
I NEED TO BE ABLE

06:55.015 --> 06:56.149
TO REACH YOU, ALWAYS.

06:56.183 --> 06:57.184
OKAY.

07:06.660 --> 07:09.162
MOM, WHAT'S WRONG?

07:09.196 --> 07:11.499
DID SOMETHING
HAPPEN WITH DAD?

07:11.532 --> 07:13.433
IS IT WORK?

07:15.803 --> 07:17.170
YOU KNOW...

07:17.204 --> 07:21.174
THIS WHOLE...
PAST YEAR...

07:21.208 --> 07:23.877
WHENEVER YOU HAVE
LEFT THE HOUSE,

07:23.911 --> 07:25.846
THERE'S A PART OF ME
THAT'S BEEN TERRIFIED

07:25.879 --> 07:27.648
THAT YOU MIGHT
NEVER COME BACK.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.517
EVERY TIME YOU WALK
OUT THAT DOOR,

07:29.550 --> 07:32.052
I MEMORIZE THE COLOR
OF YOUR TOP,

07:32.085 --> 07:33.987
WHETHER YOU'RE WEARING
JEANS OR A SKIRT,

07:34.021 --> 07:35.523
WHAT KIND OF SHOES
YOU HAVE ON,

07:35.556 --> 07:37.190
JUST IN CASE
I EVER HAVE TO--

07:37.224 --> 07:39.192
NO, MOM, DON'T.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.961
DON'T GO THERE.

07:40.994 --> 07:43.897
WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

07:43.931 --> 07:45.533
IT'S OVER.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.167
WE CAN BREATHE AGAIN.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.038
YEAH.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.917
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD
WHAT PEOPLE MEANT

08:03.951 --> 08:08.088
WHEN THEY SAID THEY HAD
AN OUT-OF-BODY EXPERIENCE,

08:08.121 --> 08:11.224
BUT AFTER I HEARD
MELISSA SCREAM...

08:11.258 --> 08:14.261
IT WAS LIKE EVERYTHING
WAS IN SLOW MOTION.

08:16.597 --> 08:19.800
LOOK, IT'S...
GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME

08:19.833 --> 08:22.636
FOR THAT NIGHT TO GO AWAY.

08:25.773 --> 08:28.075
Aria: I THINK
THE HARDEST PART IS...

08:28.108 --> 08:29.743
( knocking loudly )
HEY, "Z," I WANTED...

08:29.777 --> 08:32.245
SORRY. I DIDN'T REALIZE.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.881
HEY, JACKIE,
THIS IS ARIA,

08:34.914 --> 08:37.217
A FORMER STUDENT OF MINE.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.852
I THINK WE'VE MET,
ACTUALLY.

08:39.886 --> 08:42.022
AREN'T YOU PROFESSOR
MONTGOMERY'S DAUGHTER?

08:42.054 --> 08:44.157
YEAH, UM, WE MET AT
MY PARENTS' PLACE, I THINK.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.660
WE-- WE MET AT MY
PARENTS' PLACE, I THINK.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.598
I-I WAS JUST ON THE WAY
TO MY DAD'S OFFICE

08:50.631 --> 08:52.700
WHEN I RAN INTO...
MR. FITZ.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.267
SHE'S NOT YOUR
STUDENT ANYMORE.

08:54.301 --> 08:57.104
I THINK YOU CAN LET
THE GIRL CALL YOU
BY YOUR FIRST NAME.

08:57.137 --> 08:58.906
OH.
( chuckles )

08:58.939 --> 09:02.009
I JUST STOPPED BY
'CAUSE THE PSYCH DEPARTMENT

09:02.042 --> 09:04.277
MOVED THEIR
CONFERENCE TO FRIDAY.

09:04.311 --> 09:07.247
WE DON'T HAVE
TO TAKE OVER YOUR
LECTURE HALL AFTER ALL.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.049
NICE SEEING YOU AGAIN, ARIA.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.051
MMM, YOU TOO!

09:16.657 --> 09:18.291
"Z"?

09:18.325 --> 09:20.060
ALL MY COLLEGE FRIENDS
CALL ME THAT.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.763
YEAH, WELL,
FROM AGES 2 TO 7,

09:22.796 --> 09:24.632
MY FAMILY USED TO
CALL ME "POOKIE BEAR,"

09:24.665 --> 09:27.034
BUT... ALL GOOD THINGS
MUST COME TO AN END.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.703
ARIA.
I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST...

09:29.737 --> 09:31.705
FRUSTRATING, YOU KNOW?

09:31.739 --> 09:33.807
THE WHOLE POINT OF YOU
WORKING HERE WAS SO THAT

09:33.841 --> 09:36.143
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
TO INTRODUCE ME AS
YOUR FORMER STUDENT.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.746
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO OFFER UP
THAT STUFF ABOUT YOUR DAD.

09:38.779 --> 09:41.915
YOU BASICALLY DEMOTED ME
TO A PIT STOP.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.250
OKAY, WHATEVER.

09:43.283 --> 09:46.286
CLEARLY, WE BOTH
NEED TO FIND SOME WAY

09:46.319 --> 09:49.022
TO WARM PEOPLE UP
TO THE IDEA OF US
AS A COUPLE.

09:49.056 --> 09:53.126
HOW ABOUT I START
INTRODUCING YOU
AS POOKIE BEAR?

09:53.160 --> 09:55.729
MMM! NO.

09:55.763 --> 09:59.066
HOW 'BOUT YOU JUST START
INTRODUCING ME AS A FRIEND?

09:59.099 --> 10:00.934
( chuckles ) OKAY.

10:00.968 --> 10:03.170
SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.

10:06.974 --> 10:09.276
HEY. SOMEONE TRIED
TO DELIVER A PACKAGE
TO MY HOUSE.

10:09.309 --> 10:12.079
IT'S PROBABLY FOR MY MOM,
BUT SHE'S OUT OF TOWN.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.081
I WAS WONDERING IF
I COULD SIGN FOR IT.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.716
DO YOU HAVE ANY I.D.?

10:15.749 --> 10:16.950
SURE.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.291
DO I KNOW YOU?

10:27.861 --> 10:29.797
UH, NO, I-I DON'T THINK SO.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.873
DID YOU
GO TO ROSEWOOD HIGH?

10:39.907 --> 10:41.675
UH, N-NO.

10:41.709 --> 10:44.712
UM... EXCUSE ME.
I'VE GOT TO MAKE
A DELIVERY.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.761
LOOK, SOMEBODY PAID ME
TO DROP OFF THIS BAG

11:00.794 --> 11:02.162
AND PICK UP A PACKAGE.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.932
HE FOUND ME ONLINE.
MY NAME IS LOGAN REED.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.874
( knocking softly )

11:13.907 --> 11:15.108
HEY.

11:17.044 --> 11:19.012
I MADE YOU SOME TEA.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.948
OH, THANKS.

11:20.981 --> 11:23.183
WREN CALLED,

11:23.216 --> 11:25.218
TO SEE HOW YOU
AND MELISSA WERE.

11:25.252 --> 11:27.287
THAT WAS NICE OF HIM.

11:27.320 --> 11:30.423
IT'S A GOOD THING
YOUR FATHER DIDN'T ANSWER.
HE WOULD HAVE HUNG UP.

11:30.457 --> 11:34.461
HE'S NOT AS
FORGIVING AS I AM.

11:34.494 --> 11:37.898
I THOUGHT YOUR TEACHERS
GAVE YOU EXTENSIONS ON
ALL OF YOUR HOMEWORK.

11:37.931 --> 11:40.067
OH, THEY DID. BUT...

11:40.100 --> 11:42.235
EXAMS ARE STILL NEXT WEEK.

11:42.269 --> 11:43.470
YOU WORK SO HARD.

11:44.938 --> 11:46.740
YOU ALWAYS HAVE.

11:49.242 --> 11:50.978
WE MADE THE ARRANGEMENTS
FOR THE FUNERAL.

11:52.512 --> 11:54.114
THERE WILL BE NO FRILLS:

11:54.147 --> 11:58.051
NO FLOWERS, AND AS FAR AS
I'M CONCERNED, NO TEARS.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.120
Yeah.

12:00.153 --> 12:03.423
YOUR FATHER AND I WERE
VERY MOVED BY YOUR DESIRE
TO DO THIS FOR YOUR SISTER.

12:06.359 --> 12:09.129
I JUST THINK SHE NEEDS
SOME KIND OF CEREMONY.

12:09.162 --> 12:12.265
YOU WERE RIGHT.

12:12.299 --> 12:15.202
WE DID NEED TO DO THIS.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.204
I CALLED THE GIRLS
TO SEE IF THEY WOULD

12:17.237 --> 12:20.808
COME TO THE FUNERAL
TO SUPPORT YOU.

12:20.841 --> 12:23.143
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.
I'M THE ONE THAT
SEPARATED YOU.

12:23.176 --> 12:26.079
MOM, IT'S OKAY.
NO, IT'S NOT.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.882
IT'S NOT OKAY THAT
I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU,

12:28.916 --> 12:32.820
AND IT'S NOT OKAY
THAT I...

12:32.853 --> 12:35.088
THAT I ALLOWED
A MONSTER IN MY HOUSE.

12:35.122 --> 12:39.059
BUT I PROMISE I WILL
NEVER DO IT AGAIN.

12:41.161 --> 12:44.331
WILL YOU GIVE ME
ANOTHER CHANCE?

12:46.867 --> 12:48.068
OF COURSE.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.475
I LOVE YOU
SO MUCH, HONEY.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.089
Male Vocalist:
 * SOUL ON LOCKDOWN

13:10.423 --> 13:12.425
* FROM OPEN TO CLOSING

13:14.161 --> 13:17.530
* LEAVE THE FRESH AIR
 TO PAPER PLANES *

13:20.901 --> 13:22.936
* A BETTER LIFE NOW

13:24.437 --> 13:26.439
* IT MUST BE HIDING

13:28.141 --> 13:31.211
* FAR AWAY FROM
 THE SAME OLD THING *

13:34.915 --> 13:39.052
* YEAH, GOT A LONG LIST
 OF ENEMIES *

13:39.086 --> 13:42.055
* WHAT'S ANOTHER
 GONNA DO TO ME? *

13:42.089 --> 13:46.026
* I DON'T CARE
 IF YOU DON'T APPROVE *

13:49.196 --> 13:52.866
* DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT
 WHAT YOU THINK *

13:52.900 --> 13:55.068
* DO YOUR BEST TO GET
 THE BEST OF ME *

13:55.102 --> 13:59.172
* NOTHING IN MY BLOOD IS
 EVER GONNA FOLLOW SUIT *

14:01.208 --> 14:02.342
* FOLLOW SUIT

14:11.084 --> 14:13.853
( text message
indicator plinks )

14:46.386 --> 14:47.587
MIKE.

14:48.989 --> 14:50.924
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

14:50.958 --> 14:52.926
HEY! MIKE!

14:54.661 --> 14:56.296
HE BROKE INTO YOUR HOUSE?

14:56.329 --> 15:00.000
NEVER GOT IN, ACTUALLY.
CAUGHT HIM AT THE WINDOW.

15:00.033 --> 15:03.103
THE HOUSE WAS DARK.
I'M GUESSING HE THOUGHT
NO ONE WAS HOME.

15:03.136 --> 15:05.572
( sighs )

15:05.605 --> 15:07.407
I'M REALLY SORRY.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.043
HE'S-- HE'S NEVER DONE
ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.

15:13.546 --> 15:17.384
THANK YOU FOR NOT
CALLING THE POLICE.

15:17.417 --> 15:20.053
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

15:22.189 --> 15:23.390
I REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL YOU.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.960
LOOK, IF...

15:26.994 --> 15:29.596
IF I TELL MY PARENTS,
THEY ARE GONNA FLIP OUT.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.531
BUT IF I DON'T, THEN HE'S--

15:31.564 --> 15:34.934
NO, DON'T. HE KNOWS
HE'S BEEN BUSTED.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.437
UM...

15:39.172 --> 15:42.275
WHY-- WHY DIDN'T YOU?
CALL THE POLICE?

15:44.011 --> 15:46.379
I'VE SEEN ENOUGH COPS
IN MY HOUSE FOR ONE YEAR.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.218
RIGHT.

15:55.322 --> 15:57.690
ANYWAY... THANKS.

15:57.724 --> 16:00.060
THANKS AGAIN.

16:00.093 --> 16:01.628
YEAH.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.131
BYE.

16:34.227 --> 16:36.163
( sighs )

16:39.399 --> 16:40.633
HEY.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.035
HEY.

16:42.069 --> 16:44.037
LOOK, I'M--
I'M REALLY SORRY

16:44.071 --> 16:46.806
THAT YOU GOT CAUGHT
IN A FULL-ON CHICK
FLICK YESTERDAY.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.608
NO WORRIES.

16:48.641 --> 16:51.078
MY MOM USUALLY TRY AND SAVE
OUR EAT, PRAY, LO MOMENTS

16:51.111 --> 16:52.612
FOR WHEN WE'RE ALONE.

16:52.645 --> 16:56.116
HEY, DON'T APOLOGIZE, OKAY?
YOU'RE LUCKY.

16:56.149 --> 16:58.618
THE ONLY THING MY
FOSTER MOM CARES ABOUT
IS CASHING THE CHECKS.

16:58.651 --> 17:01.754
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
LIVING AT LUCAS'S.
I AM.

17:01.788 --> 17:04.357
THEN WHY IS YOUR FOSTER MOM
STILL GETTING MONEY FOR YOU?

17:04.391 --> 17:06.193
I MEAN, YOU DON'T
EVEN LIVE WITH HER.

17:06.226 --> 17:07.493
THAT'S THE DEAL.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.128
AS LONG AS I SHOW UP
FOR THAT VISIT

17:09.162 --> 17:11.364
FROM CHILD SERVICES,
JANET LEAVES ME ALONE.

17:11.397 --> 17:13.766
NO, CALEB, WHY DO YOU
HAVE TO SETTLE FOR THAT?

17:13.800 --> 17:16.469
I'M SURE THERE ARE SO MANY
OTHER AMAZING PEOPLE--

17:16.502 --> 17:18.471
YEAH, I'M SURE
THAT THERE ARE,

17:18.505 --> 17:20.473
BUT I COULD END UP
WITH A LOT WORSE.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.474
IT'S A SHORT JUMP
FROM EAT, PRAY, LOVE

17:22.509 --> 17:24.711
TO DRINK, SNAP, SLAP.

17:27.146 --> 17:29.616
( class bell rings )

17:32.685 --> 17:35.522
IAN DIDN'T COMMIT SUICIDE.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.358
THAT ENTIRE SUICIDE LETTER
IS MADE UP OF "A" TEXTS.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.393
WHAT?
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

17:40.427 --> 17:43.096
WHEN I READ IT AGAIN,
A COUPLE OF WORDS
STUCK OUT TO ME.

17:43.130 --> 17:46.099
ON A HUNCH, I CHECKED
MY OLD TEXT MESSAGES.

17:46.133 --> 17:47.567
COME HERE.

17:52.839 --> 17:54.407
"I KILLED ALISON.

17:54.441 --> 17:58.145
"I LOST MY TEMPER
BECAUSE SHE KNEW TOO MUCH.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.447
"THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH
YOU CAN BURY.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.549
"IT WON'T BE THAT EASY,

18:02.582 --> 18:04.151
"BUT I KNOW HOW TO
GET RID OF THE PAIN.

18:04.184 --> 18:05.518
"I CAN'T RUN FROM THE LAW.

18:05.552 --> 18:07.654
COME AND FIND ME. IAN."

18:07.687 --> 18:09.656
SO THESE ARE THE PARTS
FROM THE TEXTS.

18:09.689 --> 18:12.392
THERE ARE ONLY
FIVE PEOPLE THAT KNOW
ABOUT THESE TEXTS--

18:12.425 --> 18:14.261
US AND "A."

18:14.294 --> 18:16.163
IT MEANS THAT "A"
WROTE THAT SUICIDE NOTE.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.498
HOW DID YOU
FIGURE THIS OUT?

18:18.531 --> 18:21.168
PLEASE. I'VE BEEN WATCHING
 WHEEL OF FORTUNE WITH
MY MOM SINCE I WAS 3.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.170
IF "A" WROTE THIS,
THAT MEANS THAT IAN

18:23.203 --> 18:25.638
NEVER ACTUALLY CONFESSED
TO KILLING ALI IN WRITING.

18:25.672 --> 18:27.540
IT GETS WORSE.

18:27.574 --> 18:29.876
LOGAN REED,
THE GUY WHO DROPPED OFF
THE MONEY FOR IAN

18:29.909 --> 18:31.411
THE NIGHT OF THE STING?

18:31.444 --> 18:32.812
WELL, I KNOW WHERE HE WORKS.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.681
WE NEED MORE ANSWERS.

18:39.386 --> 18:40.587
HEY.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.525
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SEC?

18:45.558 --> 18:47.727
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING, OKAY?

18:47.760 --> 18:49.796
WOULD YOU CHILL?
I'M NOT TRYING TO GET
YOU IN TROUBLE.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.931
I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.401
I SAW A POSTING ONLINE.

18:54.434 --> 18:56.836
SOMEONE WAS OFFERING CASH
TO MAKE A SAME-DAY DELIVERY,

18:56.869 --> 18:58.338
SO I-I ANSWERED IT.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.473
SO IAN PAID YOU IN CASH.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.209
WHO? WHAT GUY
WHO KILLED HIMSELF?

19:02.242 --> 19:03.743
NO, I-I NEVER EVEN MET HIM.

19:03.776 --> 19:06.479
I NEVER EVEN SPOKE TO HIM.
A WOMAN HIRED ME.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.848
WHAT WOMAN?
WHAT DID SHE LOOK LIKE?

19:08.881 --> 19:11.318
I NEVER MET HER EITHER.

19:11.351 --> 19:12.719
WHEN I SPOKE TO HER
ON THE PHONE,

19:12.752 --> 19:14.754
SHE TOLD ME WHERE TO GO
AND WHAT TO SAY.

19:14.787 --> 19:17.457
SO, HOW DID SHE PAY YOU?
WE USED A P.O. BOX.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.393
CAN YOU DESCRIBE HER VOICE
OR TELL ME HOW OLD YOU
THINK THIS WOMAN WAS?

19:20.427 --> 19:22.529
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO DESCRIBE VOICES,

19:22.562 --> 19:26.199
BUT I THINK I'D RECOGNIZE IT
IF I HEARD IT AGAIN.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.802
THANKS SO MUCH
FOR YOUR CONCERN.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.572
I WILL BE SURE TO HAVE
ALL THESE FORMS BACK
TO YOU BY TOMORROW.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.344
WHAT HAPPENED TO
GIVING ME A HEAD'S UP?

19:37.377 --> 19:38.778
DO YOU KNOW HOW STUPID
IT MAKES ME LOOK

19:38.811 --> 19:40.447
WHEN I CAN'T ANSWER
QUESTIONS ABOUT YOU?

19:40.480 --> 19:42.849
HERE'S A CRIB SHEET.
I LIKE KUNG-FU FLICKS,

19:42.882 --> 19:46.219
MY FAVORITE COLOR IS BLUE,
AND I ONCE WENT FOUR DAYS
WITHOUT A MEAL.

19:46.253 --> 19:48.921
CUTE. DON'T LET IT
HAPPEN AGAIN.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.790
IT IS A SERIOUS PAIN
IN THE ASS

19:50.823 --> 19:53.393
FOR ME TO COME
ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE
JUST TO DROP THESE OFF.

20:02.535 --> 20:03.770
MIKE, WHY ARE YOU
AVOIDING ME?

20:03.803 --> 20:05.472
I'M NOT AVOIDING YOU.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.307
EVERY TIME I TRY
TO TALK TO YOU,
YOU RUN THE OTHER WAY.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.542
IT WAS STUPID.
I WAS BORED, OKAY?

20:09.576 --> 20:11.544
OKAY, LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT:

20:11.578 --> 20:13.413
YOU DECIDE
TO COMMIT A FELONY

20:13.446 --> 20:15.782
BECAUSE THEY TAKE
WRESTLING OFF TUESDAY NIGHTS?

20:15.815 --> 20:17.517
SURE. LET'S GO WITH THAT.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.452
OH, MIKE, COME ON,
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU.

20:19.486 --> 20:20.887
WHY DID YOU BREAK
INTO THE HOUSE?

20:20.920 --> 20:22.522
WHAT WERE YOU LOOKING FOR?

20:22.555 --> 20:24.724
I DIDN'T TAKE ANYTHING, OKAY?

20:24.757 --> 20:27.694
IF IT'S SUCH A BIG DEAL,
I'LL PUT EMILY'S JUNKY
CAMPING GEAR BACK.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.329
LET'S JUST DROP IT.
WAIT.

20:29.362 --> 20:32.532
YOU WERE THE ONE THAT BROKE
INTO EMILY'S GARAGE?

20:34.434 --> 20:37.537
DID YOU BREAK
INTO SPENCER'S HOUSE
AND BODY-CHECK ME TOO?

20:37.570 --> 20:40.407
THAT WASN'T ON PURPOSE.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.941
I FELT BAD.
I COULD TELL.

20:41.974 --> 20:45.278
YOU RUNNING AWAY
INTO THE NIGHT WAS
ESPECIALLY TOUCHING.

20:45.312 --> 20:47.380
I PANICKED, OKAY?
SO WHAT?

20:47.414 --> 20:49.482
WHAT, YOU HAVE SOMETHING
AGAINST MY FRIENDS?

20:49.516 --> 20:51.584
COULDN'T YOU HAVE
JUST BROKEN INTO SOME
STRANGER'S HOUSE?

20:51.618 --> 20:54.854
I HAVE.

20:54.887 --> 20:57.324
I PROMISE YOU,
I WON'T DO IT AGAIN.

20:57.357 --> 21:00.293
JUST PLEASE, DON'T TELL.

21:02.929 --> 21:05.698
UNLESS YOU WANT MOM
AND DAD TO START
FIGHTING AGAIN.

21:20.947 --> 21:23.583
HEY, CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A MINUTE?

21:26.686 --> 21:30.923
I KNOW A LOT HAS
HAPPENED BETWEEN US,

21:30.957 --> 21:33.593
AND I REALIZE
THAT IF I EXPECT YOU

21:33.626 --> 21:36.028
TO BE HONEST WITH ME,

21:36.062 --> 21:38.865
THEN I NEED TO BE
HONEST WITH YOU.

21:40.433 --> 21:42.935
I WAS ANGRY WHEN YOU
CHOSE IAN OVER ME,

21:42.969 --> 21:45.338
AND SO THAT'S WHY,
WHEN I--

21:45.372 --> 21:48.375
SWEETIE, WILL YOU
DO ME A FAVOR AND SET
THE DINING ROOM TABLE?

21:54.447 --> 21:56.383
I'M GONNA GO SET THE TABLE.

22:04.123 --> 22:06.493
SO, MOM,
I NEED YOUR OPINION.

22:06.526 --> 22:08.861
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

22:08.895 --> 22:10.897
WHAT? I HAVEN'T
EVEN ASKED YOU YET.

22:10.930 --> 22:13.533
HANNA, IT'S A FUNERAL,
NOT A NICKI MINAJ CONCERT.

22:13.566 --> 22:16.002
SO WHAT? I CAN'T
DANCE ON HIS GRAVE?

22:16.035 --> 22:18.438
CAN I AT LEAST
THROW CONFETTI?

22:18.471 --> 22:22.475
HANNA, WE ARE THERE
TO SUPPORT THE HASTINGS.

22:22.509 --> 22:24.477
IT'S HARD ENOUGH
BURYING SOMEONE
EVERYONE HATES;

22:24.511 --> 22:26.846
YOU DON'T NEED
TO CALL ATTENTION TO IT.

22:26.879 --> 22:29.582
IS THAT HOW
GRANDPA'S FUNERAL WAS?

22:33.152 --> 22:35.087
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

22:35.121 --> 22:36.989
DIDN'T GO TO MY
FATHER'S FUNERAL.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.129
DID ANYONE GO?

22:43.162 --> 22:46.466
I ASSUME WHATEVER LIVE-IN
GIRLFRIEND HE HAD AT THE TIME.

22:46.499 --> 22:49.669
WELL, THEN, HOW DO YOU EVEN
KNOW HE HAD A FUNERAL?

22:49.702 --> 22:52.405
BECAUSE IT TOOK ME
FOREVER TO PAY IT OFF.

22:52.439 --> 22:54.774
HAD TO SPREAD IT OUT
OVER FOUR CREDIT CARDS.

22:56.643 --> 22:59.712
DO YOU EVER REGRET IT?

22:59.746 --> 23:01.180
NOT GOING?

23:01.213 --> 23:02.682
NO.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.586
I LEFT TOWN BY
THE TIME I WAS 17,

23:06.619 --> 23:09.121
AND IF I COULD HAVE,
I WOULD HAVE LEFT SOONER.

23:09.155 --> 23:11.123
SO WHAT STOPPED YOU?

23:11.157 --> 23:13.993
FREEDOM COSTS, HANNA.

23:14.026 --> 23:16.663
CAN'T PUT EVERYTHING
ON A CREDIT CARD.

23:19.932 --> 23:22.569
( bell tolls )

23:26.939 --> 23:29.041
WHO'S RINGING IT THIS TIME?

23:34.747 --> 23:37.049
HEY.
HEY.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.452
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.

23:39.486 --> 23:41.120
HOW'S YOUR FAMILY DOING?

23:44.957 --> 23:46.626
Emily: WHAT ARE
THE COPS DOING HERE?

23:46.659 --> 23:48.928
UM... MY PARENTS
WANTED THEM HERE

23:48.961 --> 23:53.700
IN CASE ANY UNINVITED
GUESTS SHOWED UP.

23:53.733 --> 23:56.168
I THOUGHT MY NO-PARTY-
CRASHERS POLICY WAS STRICT.

23:56.202 --> 23:59.806
I THINK SPENCER
MEANS "ANGRY MOB WITH
TORCHES"-TYPE GUESTS.

23:59.839 --> 24:03.510
I SHOULD PROBABLY GET
BACK TO MY FAMILY.

24:03.543 --> 24:05.011
THANKS.

24:08.715 --> 24:10.082
SPENCER, WAIT.

24:10.116 --> 24:12.952
IT TURNS OUT IAN WASN'T
THE ONE WHO HIRED LOGAN.

24:12.985 --> 24:14.554
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT
THIS NOW, EMILY.

24:14.587 --> 24:16.222
LOOK, I KNOW THIS
ISN'T THE BEST PLACE,

24:16.255 --> 24:18.124
BUT YOU HAVEN'T
CALLED ME BACK.

24:18.157 --> 24:20.593
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT, PERIOD.

24:20.627 --> 24:23.229
I JUST CAN'T DO THIS
ANYMORE, OKAY?

24:23.262 --> 24:25.732
LOOK, MAYBE
DR. SULLIVAN WAS RIGHT.

24:25.765 --> 24:29.736
MAYBE WE ARE OBSESSED,
AND MAYBE THAT'S
WHAT "A" WANTS,

24:29.769 --> 24:31.604
FOR US TO STAY OBSESSED.

24:31.638 --> 24:33.239
DID YOU EVER
THINK ABOUT THAT?

24:33.272 --> 24:34.841
KEEPING US
SUSPENDED IN TIME--

24:34.874 --> 24:36.175
THE YEARS ARE
PASSING US BY,

24:36.208 --> 24:38.244
AND WE'RE STILL REREADING
OLD SUICIDE NOTES

24:38.277 --> 24:41.147
AND HUNTING DOWN
DELIVERY BOYS FOR CLUES.

24:41.180 --> 24:43.683
DON'T YOU WANT
TO KNOW THE TRUTH?

24:43.716 --> 24:45.552
DON'T WE OWE THAT
TO ALISON?

24:47.620 --> 24:48.821
IT'S NOT GONNA
BRING HER BACK.

24:48.855 --> 24:52.559
NOTHING WE EVER DO
IS GONNA BRING HER BACK,

24:52.592 --> 24:56.062
AND I NEED TO FOCUS
ON KEEPING THE PEOPLE
THAT ARE STILL HERE.

25:08.908 --> 25:11.711
EZRA. I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE COMING TO THIS.

25:11.744 --> 25:14.581
UH... I DIDN'T PLAN ON IT.

25:14.614 --> 25:16.248
HEY.

25:16.282 --> 25:21.320
BUT AFTER SPEAKING WITH ARIA,
I REALIZED HOW IMPORTANT IT IS

25:21.353 --> 25:26.025
TO... UM...

25:26.058 --> 25:28.260
SHOW MY SUPPORT FOR
ALL THE STUDENTS BY COMING--

25:28.294 --> 25:31.063
NOT ONLY FOR SPENCER,
BUT FOR ALL THE STUDENTS

25:31.097 --> 25:33.800
AFFECTED BY THE TRAGEDIES
OF THIS PAST YEAR.

25:33.833 --> 25:37.136
I'M SURE THE KIDS
REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
COME ON, SIT WITH US.

25:43.075 --> 25:45.878
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE?
SURE.

25:49.081 --> 25:51.283
Vocalists:
 * TURN OUR EYES AWAY...

25:54.020 --> 25:56.322
I KNOW THIS IS GONNA
SOUND WEIRD, BUT...

25:56.355 --> 25:58.758
I DIDN'T KNOW WHO ELSE
TO TALK TO AT THIS POINT.

25:58.791 --> 25:59.959
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND,
EMILY?

25:59.992 --> 26:02.328
IT WASN'T IAN
WHO HIRED LOGAN REED,

26:02.361 --> 26:04.130
THE GUY WHO DELIVERED
THE MONEY IN THE WOODS.

26:04.163 --> 26:07.333
HE NEVER MET IAN.
HE WAS HIRED BY A WOMAN.

26:07.366 --> 26:09.802
AND... HOW DO YOU
KNOW THIS?

26:09.836 --> 26:11.938
HE WORKS AT THAT
DELIVERY SERVICE
ON VAN OWEN.

26:11.971 --> 26:13.339
I SPOKE TO HIM.

26:13.372 --> 26:15.074
WELL, THAT'S
DEFINITELY STRANGE,

26:15.107 --> 26:17.209
BUT WE'RE JUST ABOUT
TO BURY THE KILLER.

26:17.243 --> 26:19.646
WHAT ARE YOU...
ASKING ME TO DO HERE?

26:19.679 --> 26:21.347
I... I DON'T KNOW.

26:22.882 --> 26:24.851
IF IT'LL MAKE YOU
SLEEP BETTER,

26:24.884 --> 26:26.953
I'LL TRY TO FIND OUT
WHO THAT WOMAN IS.

26:26.986 --> 26:30.189
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING,
TELLING ME.

26:31.290 --> 26:32.725
OKAY.

26:32.759 --> 26:34.026
THANK YOU.

26:38.297 --> 26:41.000
* TURN OUR EYES AWAY

26:42.134 --> 26:45.071
* TURN OUR EYES AWAY

26:45.104 --> 26:48.374
* LEANING ON THE HOPE THAT

26:48.407 --> 26:50.276
* ONE DAY EVEN WE

26:50.309 --> 26:51.878
* OH

26:51.911 --> 26:54.313
* ONE DAY EVEN WE

26:54.346 --> 26:57.616
* WILL BE SAVED

26:59.418 --> 27:02.855
* MMM

27:02.889 --> 27:06.192
* MMM

27:08.294 --> 27:11.030
( vocalists singing )

27:20.072 --> 27:25.111
* WE MUST TURN
 OUR EYES AWAY *

27:25.144 --> 27:28.147
* TURN OUR EYES AWAY

27:28.180 --> 27:31.751
* FROM THIS PATH
 WE'VE TAKEN *

27:31.784 --> 27:35.154
* WASHING CLEAN OUR FACES

27:35.187 --> 27:38.424
* TURN OUR EYES AWAY

27:38.457 --> 27:41.994
* TURN OUR EYES AWAY

27:42.028 --> 27:44.897
* LEANING ON THE HOPE THAT

27:44.931 --> 27:47.166
* ONE DAY EVEN WE

27:47.199 --> 27:48.735
* OH

27:48.768 --> 27:53.172
* ONE DAY EVEN WE
 WILL BE SAVED *

27:59.345 --> 28:01.914
YOU WAITING FOR FITZ?

28:01.948 --> 28:05.317
UH... JUST WAITING
FOR MY PARENTS.

28:05.351 --> 28:07.186
WHO'S HE WAITING FOR?

28:07.219 --> 28:08.955
I DON'T KNOW.

28:08.988 --> 28:11.958
MAYBE HE CAME HERE FOR
THE SAME REASON WE DID.

28:11.991 --> 28:13.459
TO SPIT ON IAN'S GRAVE?

28:16.495 --> 28:18.931
TO GET CLOSURE.

28:18.965 --> 28:21.333
WELL... I STILL
THINK HE'S CREEPY.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.269
EVEN IF HE
WASN'T HIDING IAN,

28:23.302 --> 28:28.074
THE GUY'S A FREAK,
AND HE ALWAYS HAS BEEN.

28:28.107 --> 28:29.942
I'M GONNA GO.

28:29.976 --> 28:31.944
TELL YOUR PARENTS
I SAID GOODBYE.

28:31.978 --> 28:33.179
OKAY. BYE.

28:39.118 --> 28:40.419
ARIA.

28:40.452 --> 28:43.089
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

28:43.122 --> 28:45.491
YEAH. SHOULD I ROUND UP
THE REST OF THE STUDENT BODY

28:45.524 --> 28:47.493
SO YOU CAN JUST
ADDRESS US AS A GROUP?

28:47.526 --> 28:50.096
LOOK, I REALLY DID
COME HERE TO SEE YOU,

28:50.129 --> 28:52.799
TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP,
BUT IT JUST WASN'T RIGHT.

28:54.400 --> 28:58.437
WELL, DO YOU KNOW WHEN
THE EXACT RIGHT PLACE
AND TIME IS?

28:58.470 --> 29:01.373
BECAUSE WE KEEP TALKING
ABOUT SLOWLY MOVING FORWARD

29:01.407 --> 29:03.843
AND DIPPING OUR TOES
IN THE POOL.

29:03.876 --> 29:06.012
ARIA, TELLING YOUR PARENTS
IS NOT TOE-DIPPING,

29:06.045 --> 29:07.513
IT'S A CANNONBALL.

29:08.881 --> 29:10.182
I KNOW.

29:10.216 --> 29:11.517
( sighs )

29:11.550 --> 29:13.986
OHH. THIS WOULD BE
SO MUCH EASIER

29:14.020 --> 29:16.522
IF I COULD JUST
BLAME IT ALL ON YOU.

29:16.555 --> 29:19.391
( chuckles )
THANKS.

29:19.425 --> 29:21.994
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

29:22.028 --> 29:24.196
I KNOW THAT THIS
ISN'T ANYBODY'S FAULT.

29:24.230 --> 29:29.869
THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT
THAT I-I REALLY NEEDED
A HUG FROM YOU TODAY.

29:29.902 --> 29:32.271
NOT... LATER
AT YOUR APARTMENT

29:32.304 --> 29:35.274
OR TOMORROW AT HOLLIS,

29:35.307 --> 29:37.476
BUT HERE, RIGHT NOW.

29:42.448 --> 29:44.383
I'LL-- I'LL CALL YOU,
LATER.

30:01.333 --> 30:04.303
EXCUSE ME. HELLO?

30:05.437 --> 30:06.839
JANET.

30:08.074 --> 30:09.408
YEAH?

30:09.441 --> 30:12.611
HI. I'M HANNA.
I'M A FRIEND OF CALEB'S.

30:12.644 --> 30:15.447
THAT'S NICE, HON.
I'M SORRY. I'M IN A HURRY.

30:15.481 --> 30:17.449
THIS WON'T TAKE LONG.

30:17.483 --> 30:21.020
I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW
THAT I KNOW ABOUT YOUR
DEAL WITH CALEB.

30:21.053 --> 30:22.154
DEAL?

30:22.188 --> 30:23.890
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT,

30:23.923 --> 30:26.292
AND IT'S GONNA
HAVE TO STOP.

30:26.325 --> 30:28.327
DO YOU SEE
THAT LADY OVER THERE?

30:28.360 --> 30:30.562
THAT'S MY MOM.

30:30.596 --> 30:32.464
SHE'S ALSO A SENIOR PARTNER
AT THE FIRM OF

30:32.498 --> 30:34.066
DOLCE, GABBANA & LEIBOWITZ,

30:34.100 --> 30:36.202
SO I SUGGEST THAT YOU
GIVE CALEB HIS MONEY

30:36.235 --> 30:38.604
AND CONTINUE
TO GIVE HIM HIS MONEY
UNTIL HE TURNS 18,

30:38.637 --> 30:40.940
OR I'LL HAVE TO UNLEASH
ERIN "BROCKO-BITCH" ON YOU

30:40.973 --> 30:43.175
AND HAUL YOUR BUTT
INTO COURT.

30:53.652 --> 30:54.921
HEY.

30:54.954 --> 30:56.322
HI.

30:56.355 --> 31:00.026
THANKS AGAIN FOR...
HELPING MY BROTHER OUT.

31:04.530 --> 31:08.400
WHY ARE YOU SO WILLING
TO GIVE MY BROTHER
A FREE PASS?

31:08.434 --> 31:11.103
I DON'T KNOW.

31:11.137 --> 31:14.006
MAYBE IT'S 'CAUSE
ALI USED TO THREATEN TO
TURN ME IN ALL THE TIME.

31:22.148 --> 31:23.349
DID SHE EVER?

31:26.685 --> 31:28.420
ALI WAS TOO SMART FOR THAT.

31:28.454 --> 31:30.656
EVEN AS A KID.

31:30.689 --> 31:32.258
SHE WAS FEARLESS.

31:32.291 --> 31:33.492
SHE NEEDED TO BE.

31:37.029 --> 31:38.998
I WAS ALWAYS
JEALOUS OF THAT.

31:39.031 --> 31:40.967
OF HER.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.970
I GUESS THAT'S WHY
MY PARENTS CAN'T EVEN
LOOK AT ME ANYMORE--

31:46.172 --> 31:48.340
THEY KNOW THEY LOST
THE WRONG KID.

31:49.708 --> 31:51.978
DON'T SAY THAT.

31:59.185 --> 32:00.519
LOOK...

32:03.189 --> 32:07.426
MAYBE YOU COMING HERE
TODAY WAS A MISTAKE.

32:07.459 --> 32:09.295
JUST THE OPPOSITE,
ACTUALLY.

32:11.230 --> 32:14.133
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW GOOD
IT FEELS TO KNOW IT
WASN'T ME.

32:16.368 --> 32:18.570
I DON'T REMEMBER A THING

32:18.604 --> 32:21.373
FROM THE NIGHT ALI DIED.

32:21.407 --> 32:24.076
I BLACKED OUT AND WOKE UP
THE NEXT MORNING

32:24.110 --> 32:26.545
WITH A WICKED HANGOVER
AND...

32:32.351 --> 32:33.552
AND THIS.

32:42.394 --> 32:43.429
WHO GAVE YOU THIS?

32:45.397 --> 32:47.766
WHAT-- WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

32:47.799 --> 32:51.403
I DON'T KNOW, BUT...
IT ALMOST DESTROYED ME.

32:52.538 --> 32:54.506
YOU THOUGHT THAT
YOU KILLED HER?

32:54.540 --> 32:56.608
LIKE I SAID,
I WAS JEALOUS,

32:56.642 --> 32:58.610
AND WHEN I GOT LOADED,
I GOT ANGRY.

33:01.380 --> 33:02.681
BUT...

33:02.714 --> 33:06.485
IAN'S CONFESSION
HAS CHANGED EVERYTHING.

33:06.518 --> 33:09.055
HE DID IT, NOT ME.

33:17.396 --> 33:20.232
HEY, I'M GOING OUT.
DO YOU NEED ANYTHING?

33:20.266 --> 33:22.201
IT'S A GIRL.

33:28.074 --> 33:29.375
IT IS?

33:29.408 --> 33:31.310
YEAH.

33:32.411 --> 33:34.346
CONGRATULATIONS.

33:36.282 --> 33:40.519
I'M SORRY I CHOSE
IAN OVER YOU.

33:40.552 --> 33:44.456
I JUST... COULDN'T BELIEVE
THAT HE WOULD EVER...

33:46.158 --> 33:47.526
DO THAT TO SOMEONE.

33:49.428 --> 33:51.397
FINDING OUT HE WASN'T
WHO I THOUGHT HE WAS,

33:51.430 --> 33:55.134
IT'S LIKE...
LOSING HIM TWICE.

33:55.167 --> 33:57.136
I'M SO SORRY.

33:57.169 --> 33:59.138
NO.

33:59.171 --> 34:00.672
I DESERVE IT.

34:00.706 --> 34:02.541
I'VE LIED SO MUCH:

34:02.574 --> 34:05.544
TO YOU, TO THE COPS,
TO MOM AND DAD.

34:05.577 --> 34:08.714
GOD, I THOUGHT
I WAS PROTECTING
AN INNOCENT MAN.

34:08.746 --> 34:11.583
WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES.
I-I HAVE TOO.

34:11.617 --> 34:14.120
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO,
I FOUND YOUR R--
WAIT, SPENCER.

34:14.152 --> 34:17.089
LET ME GET THIS OUT
WHILE I HAVE THE COURAGE.

34:19.324 --> 34:22.828
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT
YOU DON'T KNOW, AND--

34:22.860 --> 34:25.431
( cell phone rings )

34:27.466 --> 34:29.768
( ring )

34:32.204 --> 34:33.705
( ring )

34:33.739 --> 34:36.375
WHY DO YOU HAVE
IAN'S PHONE?

34:36.408 --> 34:38.177
I DON'T KNOW.

34:39.311 --> 34:40.812
WAIT A MINUTE.

34:40.846 --> 34:43.549
YOU-- YOU SENT ME
THOSE TEXTS?

34:43.581 --> 34:46.851
WHAT? NO!
I KNOW HE'S BEEN
DEAD OVER A WEEK!

34:46.885 --> 34:49.755
I KNOW HE DIDN'T SEND ME
THOSE MESSAGES!
NO, MELISSA, I DIDN'T!

34:49.788 --> 34:52.591
YOU PRETENDED TO BE IAN?
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO ME?

34:52.623 --> 34:54.193
I SWEAR TO YOU,
I DIDN'T!

34:54.226 --> 34:56.428
YOU MUST REALLY HATE ME!

34:57.863 --> 35:00.399
I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU
FOR THIS!

35:14.180 --> 35:16.282
HONEY, YOU'RE
STARTING TO SCARE ME.

35:16.315 --> 35:19.485
YOU'VE WASHED CLOTHES
THAT HAVEN'T EVEN
BEEN WORN YET.

35:19.518 --> 35:22.421
I CAN'T HELP IT.
EVERYTHING JUST FEELS DIRTY.

35:22.454 --> 35:25.291
COME ON, LET'S GO
DOWNSTAIRS AND HAVE
A GLASS OF WINE.

35:25.324 --> 35:26.892
OR SCOTCH.

35:26.925 --> 35:28.327
ABSINTHE?

35:31.463 --> 35:35.567
HE WAS A COACH
AT OUR CHILDREN'S SCHOOL.

35:35.601 --> 35:38.870
I USED TO SAY HI TO HIM
IN THE TEACHERS' LOUNGE.

35:38.904 --> 35:40.939
YOU COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN
WHAT HE'D DONE.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.408
NONE OF US DID.

35:42.441 --> 35:45.377
HE REALLY SEEMED
LIKE A NICE GUY.

35:46.745 --> 35:49.281
I GUESS WE SEE
WHAT WE WANT TO SEE.

35:49.315 --> 35:50.582
Mike: HEY.

35:50.616 --> 35:53.652
I'M GOING OUT, GRAB
FOOD WITH MY FRIENDS.

35:55.487 --> 35:58.190
CAN YOU STOP
WASHING MY SWEATS?

35:58.224 --> 36:00.259
I SMELL LIKE A CANDLE.

36:02.328 --> 36:04.596
I'LL TAKE THAT GLASS
OF ABSINTHE NOW.

36:10.636 --> 36:12.271
COUNT IT IF YOU LIKE.

36:12.304 --> 36:14.906
THAT'S OKAY.
I BELIEVE YOU.

36:14.940 --> 36:17.576
GOOD. THEN I GUESS
I WON'T BE SEEING YOU AGAIN.

36:17.609 --> 36:19.345
I GUESS NOT.

36:27.386 --> 36:30.356
HEY, JEN, IT'S ME.

36:30.389 --> 36:32.458
YEAH, DON'T WORRY.
IT'S TAKEN CARE OF.

36:34.793 --> 36:36.194
MOM!

36:37.396 --> 36:39.765
MOM!

36:39.798 --> 36:42.601
Vocalist:
 * SOMEDAY WE'RE GONNA
 LOOK BACK ON THIS AND LAUGH *

36:42.634 --> 36:44.636
( knock on door )
HEY.

36:44.670 --> 36:46.672
HI. WHAT'S UP?

36:46.705 --> 36:48.674
I KNOW THE FUNERAL
WAS TODAY.

36:48.707 --> 36:51.510
I JUST WANTED TO COME
CHECK ON YOU...

36:51.543 --> 36:54.380
AND TO GIVE YOU THIS.

36:54.413 --> 36:57.783
WHEN RAPPERS BRAG
ABOUT SHOWERING THEIR
LADIES WITH ICE,

36:57.816 --> 36:59.785
THEY MEAN SOMETHING ELSE.

37:01.887 --> 37:05.791
I ALSO GOT... THIS:

37:05.824 --> 37:07.926
SOUP DUMPLINGS
AND WALNUT SHRIMP.

37:07.959 --> 37:09.928
THAT WAS SWEET.

37:09.961 --> 37:11.463
BEFORE YOU GET
CARRIED AWAY,

37:11.497 --> 37:12.864
IT'S GONNA NEED
TO BE REHEATED.

37:12.898 --> 37:15.667
I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE
SPRUNG FOR TWO BAGS.

37:15.701 --> 37:19.271
LOOK, CALEB, YOU REALLY
DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS.
HOW MUCH DO I OWE YOU?

37:19.305 --> 37:22.274
NOTHING. I'M GOOD.
WEIRDEST THING:

37:22.308 --> 37:24.276
JANET SHOWED UP OUT OF
NOWHERE AND GAVE ME

37:24.310 --> 37:25.677
AN ENVELOPE
FILLED WITH CASH.

37:25.711 --> 37:27.679
REALLY?
YEAH.

37:27.713 --> 37:29.681
WOW. THAT'S CRAZY.

37:29.715 --> 37:31.683
I KNOW. BUT I GUESS
I SHOULDN'T LOOK

37:31.717 --> 37:33.652
A GIFT HORSE
IN THE MOUTH.

37:33.685 --> 37:37.055
YEAH, ESPECIALLY WHEN
HORSE-FACE IS GIVING
YOU MONEY!

37:37.088 --> 37:38.657
( chuckles )

37:40.359 --> 37:41.993
WELL, I SHOULD PROBABLY GO.

37:42.027 --> 37:43.829
GOONIES IS ON TV TONIGHT.

37:43.862 --> 37:45.764
PROMISED LUCAS
I'D WATCH IT WITH HIM.

37:45.797 --> 37:47.999
OH. ALL RIGHT,
WELL, THAT SOUNDS FUN.

37:48.033 --> 37:49.735
YOU MUST NOT HAVE HEARD ME.

37:49.768 --> 37:51.870
I SAID WE'RE WATCHING
 GOONIES TONIGHT.

37:51.903 --> 37:56.608
( both laugh )

37:56.642 --> 37:58.076
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

37:58.109 --> 37:59.945
DOLCE,
GABBANA & LEIBOWITZ?

38:05.951 --> 38:07.786
WAIT.

38:07.819 --> 38:11.590
* IF I LOST MY FAITH...

38:11.623 --> 38:13.825
( indistinct vocalizing )

38:18.497 --> 38:21.933
* WHOA

38:31.377 --> 38:33.745
( text message
indicator plinks )

39:14.953 --> 39:16.988
ARIA: Okay,
if we get caught,
we are in so much trouble!

39:17.022 --> 39:18.757
HANNA: Oh, please.

39:18.790 --> 39:20.959
Like we're
the first teenagers
to sneak in a graveyard?

39:20.992 --> 39:23.094
EMILY: It's like
chapter one of every
Stephen King book.

39:23.128 --> 39:24.830
SPENCER: Guys!
Not helping.

39:24.863 --> 39:26.698
EMILY: Okay,
I think we're close.

39:26.732 --> 39:28.700
WAIT. STOP.

39:28.734 --> 39:30.101
I'M-- I'M NOT
GOING ANY FURTHER

39:30.135 --> 39:31.803
UNTIL YOU TELL ME
WHY WE'RE HERE.

39:31.837 --> 39:34.640
I TOLD YOU,
I THINK "A" SET US UP.

39:34.673 --> 39:36.442
AND I DO TOO.

39:36.475 --> 39:39.144
EMILY'S RIGHT.
THIS ISN'T OVER.

39:39.177 --> 39:41.647
I THOUGHT I'D FEEL
DIFFERENTLY ONCE
WE BURIED IAN,

39:41.680 --> 39:44.983
BUT I DON'T, AND IT'S
BECAUSE "A" IS STILL ALIVE
AND CALLING THE SHOTS.

39:45.016 --> 39:46.985
BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

39:47.018 --> 39:48.987
I THINK "A" TOOK THE BODY

39:49.020 --> 39:50.989
AND MADE IT
LOOK LIKE A SUICIDE.

39:51.022 --> 39:52.524
WHY WOULD "A" DO THAT?

39:52.558 --> 39:54.493
SO THAT THE CONFESSION
IN THE SUICIDE NOTE

39:54.526 --> 39:57.496
MAKES ALI'S MURDER LOOK
LIKE AN OPEN-AND-SHUT CASE.

39:57.529 --> 39:59.631
BUT THAT WOULD MEAN
THAT "A" WAS HELPING US.

39:59.665 --> 40:01.767
THIS WHOLE TIME,
WE'VE BEEN TRYING
TO CONVINCE THE POLICE

40:01.800 --> 40:03.835
THAT IAN KILLED ALI.
EXACTLY.

40:03.869 --> 40:06.705
AND WHY WOULD "A" HELP US
WHEN WE KNOW THAT "A"
ULTIMATELY WANTS TO HURT US?

40:06.738 --> 40:09.441
UGH! I'M CONFUSED,
AND I'M STEPPING
ON SOMETHING MUSHY.

40:09.475 --> 40:11.443
WHAT SPENCE MEANS IS,
HOW DO WE KNOW FOR SURE

40:11.477 --> 40:13.111
THAT IAN IS ALI'S KILLER?

40:13.144 --> 40:15.981
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THE "KISSING ROCK" VIDEO.

40:16.014 --> 40:17.583
AND-- AND
THE MISSING TREE.

40:17.616 --> 40:19.451
"A" GAVE US THOSE THINGS.

40:19.485 --> 40:22.087
"A" IS THE ONE WHO
HANDED US ALI'S KILLER
ON A SILVER PLATTER.

40:22.120 --> 40:24.089
AND WHATEVER "A" GIVES,
THE BITCH TAKES BACK.

40:27.626 --> 40:29.628
GUYS, LOOK.

40:41.172 --> 40:43.141
( Alison laughing )

40:43.174 --> 40:45.110
I KNOW YOU WANT TO KISS ME.

40:54.185 --> 40:57.455
Ian: COME CLOSER.
WHERE'S IT COMING FROM?

41:09.601 --> 41:11.670
( all gasp )

41:11.703 --> 41:16.274
( Alison giggles )

41:16.307 --> 41:18.276
OH, MY GOD!

41:18.309 --> 41:20.746
SHE WAS STILL ALIVE!

41:23.549 --> 41:25.250
Alison:
 THANKS FOR MEETING ME.

41:29.955 --> 41:32.791
( Alison giggles )

41:45.103 --> 41:48.206
Spencer: I DEFINITELY THINK
THE PROJECTOR'S OVER HERE.

41:48.239 --> 41:50.108
Aria: I DON'T KNOW.
IT HA TO BE CLOSER.

41:50.141 --> 41:52.077
Hanna: ARE YOU SURE
IT WASN'T FURTHER AWAY?

41:52.110 --> 41:53.679
Emily: WASN'T IT
ON THE GROUND?

41:53.712 --> 41:55.614
Spencer: NO, IT WAS
DEFINITELY UP IN A TREE.
