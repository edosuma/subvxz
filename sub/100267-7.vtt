00:13.551 --> 00:16.288
Well, you seen some pretty
outrageous things in your life,

00:16.321 --> 00:20.458
but nothin' more outrageous than
what you seen the other day.

00:20.492 --> 00:22.695
‐Favorite superhero, go.
‐Hmm, Superman.

00:22.728 --> 00:23.996
‐Wonder Woman.
‐Batman.

00:24.029 --> 00:25.263
‐Deadpool.
‐Why Batman?

00:25.297 --> 00:27.299
‐He's quiet.
‐Ah, mysterious.

00:27.332 --> 00:29.735
No mystique, big mistake.

00:30.969 --> 00:34.406
‐Tell them that.
‐BOTH: Nuh‐nuh!

00:35.273 --> 00:37.575
Pete and repeat. W5.

00:37.609 --> 00:39.978
‐Just finished a runski.
‐Little jogski.

00:40.012 --> 00:41.747
‐Little sprintski.
‐A little trotski.

00:41.780 --> 00:43.816
‐Good film.
‐You don't wanna see this?

00:43.849 --> 00:46.251
WAYNE: I smell body spray,
so I know it can't be good.

00:46.284 --> 00:47.419
Alexander.

00:47.452 --> 00:52.290
Confucius say a man who stand
on toilet is high on pot.

00:52.324 --> 00:53.425
What do you think
about these two?

00:53.458 --> 00:55.961
They're not gonna get
any chicks dressing like gays.

00:55.994 --> 00:57.495
What if they are gay?

00:57.529 --> 00:58.864
Then they're definitely
not gonna get any chicks now.

00:58.897 --> 01:01.033
Your junk looks like it wants
to shake my hand.

01:01.066 --> 01:03.001
You stuffed a winter glove
down there?

01:03.035 --> 01:06.238
Looks like a Ziploc baggie
full of carrot sticks to me.

01:06.805 --> 01:08.073
Small price to pay

01:08.106 --> 01:11.476
for the scientific competitive
edge, boys. Compression tights.

01:11.509 --> 01:14.346
We're over here decreasing
wind resistance by 2%,

01:14.379 --> 01:16.314
you're sitting
over there like suckers.

01:16.348 --> 01:18.650
You're decreasing your manhood
by a significantly...

01:18.684 --> 01:19.985
BOTH: ...larger percentage.

01:20.018 --> 01:21.820
A significantly larger
percentage, yeah.

01:21.854 --> 01:24.056
All right, let me get to the
bottom of this... Holy fuck!

01:24.089 --> 01:26.692
Give me one good reason why you
wanna go running in tights

01:26.725 --> 01:28.060
with your junk
bouncin' about.

01:28.093 --> 01:29.828
Give me one good reason
why we shouldn't.

01:29.862 --> 01:31.730
‐WAYNE: Want two?
‐Even better.

01:31.764 --> 01:33.465
Women and children.

01:33.498 --> 01:36.034
‐Tights are for girls.
‐Compression tights.

01:36.068 --> 01:37.903
They hold your muscles
firmly in place

01:37.936 --> 01:40.906
while improving
blood flow to the muscles.

01:40.939 --> 01:42.975
So, Lululemon comes along.

01:43.008 --> 01:45.043
Revolutionizes
the female ass game.

01:45.077 --> 01:48.580
Dudes say they love it because
they secretly want to wear it?

01:48.613 --> 01:49.982
These are nothing
like Lululemons.

01:50.015 --> 01:52.084
They're exactly
like Lululemons.

01:52.117 --> 01:53.786
Okay, yeah, but they're
not Lululemons.

01:53.819 --> 01:54.720
WAYNE: If it
looks like a duck

01:54.753 --> 01:56.521
‐and quacks like a duck...
‐They're not!

01:56.554 --> 01:57.655
What if they are?

01:57.690 --> 01:59.424
Then they're definitely not
gonna get any chicks now.

01:59.457 --> 02:01.894
They're for increased athletic
performance, boys.

02:01.927 --> 02:03.829
But we can see
your junk, boys.

02:03.862 --> 02:05.597
That's actually not
from the tights.

02:05.630 --> 02:08.033
Uh, we're also wearing this new
kind of underwear called Bagz.

02:08.066 --> 02:09.702
WAYNE: They're coming' land,
sea and air.

02:09.735 --> 02:11.369

02:11.403 --> 02:12.570
Separates your dink
from your balls.

02:12.604 --> 02:13.772
And your balls from your leg.

02:13.806 --> 02:14.840
To avoid chafing.

02:14.873 --> 02:16.675
‐Dudes chafe?
‐WAYNE: No.

02:16.709 --> 02:18.977
(SCOFFS) Try running
in compression tights, bud.

02:19.011 --> 02:19.978
WAYNE: No!

02:20.012 --> 02:22.014
How do they separate
your balls from your leg?

02:22.047 --> 02:23.115
You put on your gitch, right?

02:23.148 --> 02:25.350
Just like any other day.
Nothing out of the ordinary.

02:25.383 --> 02:26.785
But with Bagz,
when you pull 'em up,

02:26.819 --> 02:28.486
you drop your balls
into a hammock‐like pouch.

02:28.520 --> 02:30.022
(POPS TONGUE)

02:30.055 --> 02:31.156
Yeah, you just set 'em in there,
like... (POPS TONGUE)

02:31.189 --> 02:33.458
And you just drop your balls
in the pouch right there.

02:33.491 --> 02:34.526
Yeah, you just station
them in there,

02:34.559 --> 02:35.493
like... (POPS TONGUE)

02:35.527 --> 02:37.730
But that makes your junk
stick out even more?

02:37.763 --> 02:39.431
You tell me, Katy‐Kat.

02:39.464 --> 02:40.833
WAYNE: All right, so you wanna

02:40.866 --> 02:42.434
You throw on some tights.

02:42.467 --> 02:43.702
Compression tights.

02:43.736 --> 02:45.570
Junk's out there.
Women and children.

02:45.603 --> 02:47.005
Increased athletic performance.

02:47.039 --> 02:49.541
WAYNE: And then you put on
some special underwear

02:49.574 --> 02:50.776
with a pouch for your balls...

02:50.809 --> 02:52.678
Just set them in there.
(POPS TONGUE)

02:52.711 --> 02:54.713
Yeah, just drop your balls
in the little pouch right there.

02:54.747 --> 02:56.014
WAYNE: That make your junk

02:56.048 --> 02:58.016
‐stick out more.
‐Oh, that's it, boys.

02:58.050 --> 02:59.584
That's the dagger.

03:01.419 --> 03:03.455
KATY: (SOFTLY)
Oh, God.

03:04.990 --> 03:08.160
No mystique,
big mistake.

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

03:16.935 --> 03:17.870
You're early.

03:17.903 --> 03:19.437
If you're not 10 minutes
early, you're late.

03:21.506 --> 03:24.509
‐Very cool. Very nice.
‐Fuck you.

03:24.542 --> 03:27.412

03:30.215 --> 03:31.717
I hear you're taking
your little cousin

03:31.750 --> 03:33.651
to Quebec
for his 18th birthday.

03:33.686 --> 03:35.988
‐That okay?
‐Just making conversation.

03:37.022 --> 03:38.791
Why Quebec?

03:39.825 --> 03:41.026
Well, he's turning 18.

03:41.059 --> 03:43.428
The legal drinking age
in Quebec is 18,

03:43.461 --> 03:46.131
so, do the math.

03:46.164 --> 03:48.633
‐Fuck off!
‐What's that?

03:48.666 --> 03:51.536
Not you. Girl behind you
just crop‐dusted.

03:52.738 --> 03:56.574
Very gnarly. Very gnarly,
very unnecessary.

03:56.608 --> 03:58.977
Unusual business,

03:59.011 --> 04:01.446

doing that

‐Sorry?

05:15.988 --> 05:17.155
You're missing your book.

I've read this book
several times, so...

05:20.092 --> 05:21.226
Not missing much.

05:21.259 --> 05:22.660
Must be a pretty
good book.

05:22.695 --> 05:24.496
Oh, it's a great
book, it's...

05:25.197 --> 05:26.799
The Black Donnellys.

05:31.704 --> 05:34.306
‐I like how those pants fit.
‐It's a good pant.

05:34.339 --> 05:35.741
Good pants?

05:35.774 --> 05:37.042
Why, is there more
than one pant?

05:37.075 --> 05:38.243
It's a pair of pants.

05:38.276 --> 05:40.078
Oh, the gal at the store
called it a pant.

05:40.112 --> 05:42.214
Well, that's a gal who should
know they're called pants.

05:42.247 --> 05:44.049
One time she
called it a jean.

05:44.082 --> 05:45.984
Bet she liked
how that jean fit too.

‐Hmm.

‐Tough go, eh?
‐Yep.

06:03.035 --> 06:04.536
Getting any easier?

06:06.371 --> 06:07.605
Yep.

06:10.809 --> 06:11.643
We going?

06:11.677 --> 06:13.779
Well, I got chorin'
to do first, so...

06:13.812 --> 06:15.748
I got two strong hands.
I can help.

06:15.781 --> 06:17.349
Well, more hands
make less work.

06:17.382 --> 06:18.884
Prove it.

06:18.917 --> 06:20.886
Oh, what, so after that,
we go over there together?

06:21.987 --> 06:23.822
Don't threaten me
with a good time.

06:25.023 --> 06:26.258
So, what would
you say if like...

06:27.292 --> 06:28.861
We started going, like,

06:30.128 --> 06:31.930
most places together.

06:32.798 --> 06:35.300
I'd say, Pitter‐Patter.

Already got a pint
of gin in the cocksucker.

06:50.415 --> 06:53.251
I think you've had more like
a fish bowl of gin there.

06:53.285 --> 06:55.353
More like a salad bowls of gins.

06:55.387 --> 06:57.790
More like a waste paper
bak‐set full of gin.

06:57.823 --> 06:59.057

06:59.091 --> 07:01.159

fill up the bathtub with gin.

‐Skip the middle man!
‐Uh‐oh. McMurray's hammered.

07:03.428 --> 07:04.797
I know what that means.

07:04.830 --> 07:06.164
‐I'm out.
‐Where's you goings?

07:06.198 --> 07:07.866
Dierks took his cousin
to Quebec

07:07.900 --> 07:09.968
for his 18th birthday,
and they just got back,

07:10.002 --> 07:12.938
so I'm headed stateside to help
them with their hangovers.

07:12.971 --> 07:14.372
That's something that
girlfriends do, right?

07:14.406 --> 07:16.074
I really wouldn't know.

07:16.108 --> 07:17.375
‐Caesars?
‐You bet.

07:18.243 --> 07:19.311
Why Quebec?

07:19.344 --> 07:21.413
Best strippers on earth
in Quebec.

07:21.446 --> 07:23.315
The legal drinking
age is 18.

07:23.348 --> 07:25.751
‐Plus you can touch 'em!
‐Touch what?

07:26.118 --> 07:27.119
The tits.

07:27.152 --> 07:28.987
You can suck on 'em
nine of 10 titty bars too.

07:30.989 --> 07:33.225
Okay, I'll bite.
Have you ever done that?

07:33.258 --> 07:37.162
(BOTH LAUGH)

Okay, boys.
Picture this.

07:43.201 --> 07:44.269
I want you
to picture this.

07:44.302 --> 07:46.338
Mrs. McMurray and I
are getting a couples lapper.

07:47.372 --> 07:50.776
So I got both hands
on one tit!

07:50.809 --> 07:53.045
‐And I'm suckin' on it.
‐I want you to picture this.

07:53.078 --> 07:54.446
I said, "This is something."

07:54.479 --> 07:56.014
I said, "Baby,
what do you think of this?"

07:56.048 --> 07:57.750
I said I've never seen
anything like it, baby.

07:57.783 --> 08:01.687
And before I know it, she's got
two hands on the other tit.

08:01.720 --> 08:02.888
And she's sucking on it.

08:02.921 --> 08:04.156
I said, "What do you
think of this, baby?"

08:04.189 --> 08:05.958
I said,
"I won't soon forget it."

08:05.991 --> 08:07.292
Yeah, that's my cue.

take a run at her.

08:19.104 --> 08:20.272

a big run at her.

08:20.305 --> 08:22.107
Youse twos are the worst.

08:22.140 --> 08:23.475
I was gonna
gun it, buddy.

08:23.508 --> 08:24.943
Sometimes you just
gotta gun it, boys.

08:24.977 --> 08:26.111
Fuckin' gun it, buddy.

08:26.144 --> 08:27.245

across the room.

08:27.279 --> 08:29.848

08:29.882 --> 08:30.949
‐Huh?
‐JONESY: Who?

08:30.983 --> 08:32.885
A guy named Dierks.
From Michigan.

08:32.918 --> 08:35.721
‐A Yank?
‐I fuckin' hate Yanks.

08:35.754 --> 08:39.157

at her, boys.

08:43.395 --> 08:45.297
Take a big run at her.

08:45.330 --> 08:48.066
You are so beneath her
at this point, peasants.

08:48.100 --> 08:50.368

to be. Ha!

08:50.402 --> 08:52.504
And Katy wouldn't even
fuck you with my dick.

08:52.537 --> 08:54.206
(SCOFFS) I wouldn't
want her to anyway.

08:54.239 --> 08:55.774
Well, don't knock it
till you've tried it.

08:55.808 --> 08:56.842
I never do.

09:01.113 --> 09:02.748
Did you guys hear
Katy's dating a Yank?

09:05.884 --> 09:07.219
(POPPIN' PLAYING)

09:19.531 --> 09:20.766
You gonna move
your bum?

09:22.200 --> 09:23.201
Move your bum.

09:26.905 --> 09:29.975
You don't want
me to go? (COOING)

09:32.277 --> 09:33.779
Okay.

09:35.313 --> 09:38.483
All right. Go and get
so I can get it.

09:39.952 --> 09:41.053
Get!

09:45.523 --> 09:46.792
‐Mmm, day beers!
‐Day beers!

09:46.825 --> 09:47.960
‐Day beers!
‐Day beers!

09:47.993 --> 09:50.328
‐Nose beers!
‐Stewart!

09:51.864 --> 09:52.965
What do you got
against Yanks, Reilly?

09:52.998 --> 09:56.434
‐I fuckin' hate Yanks.
‐Yeah, we've established that.

09:56.468 --> 09:59.037
Yank teams would come up
from Michigan and Ohio

09:59.071 --> 10:00.305
to play in our tournaments
growing up,

10:00.338 --> 10:02.107
and they were stacked.
They shit kicked us.

10:02.140 --> 10:03.575
You guys are usually
losing though, no?

10:03.608 --> 10:04.710
REILLY: This is
different, though.

10:04.743 --> 10:07.112
A team from Detroit would have
a D‐man from New York,

10:07.145 --> 10:10.215
a tendy from Boston,
and a sniper from Minnesota.

10:10.248 --> 10:13.418
They'd all fly in
thrice a week for practice,

10:13.451 --> 10:14.987
then they'd come up
and shit kick us.

10:15.020 --> 10:16.154
Religious fellas?

10:16.188 --> 10:18.323
‐What?
‐It sounds like they gots some monies.

10:18.356 --> 10:19.257
Wasn't fair.

10:19.291 --> 10:21.126
It was their best players
in their country

10:21.159 --> 10:22.594
versus the best players
in our county.

10:22.627 --> 10:24.897
I also hate Yanks!

10:24.930 --> 10:25.998
Whys do youse hate Yanks?

10:26.531 --> 10:28.300
(BOTH SCOFFING)

10:30.869 --> 10:32.805
(BEATBOXING RHYTHMICALLY)

10:35.540 --> 10:38.410
Yanks were the first to steal
and catalogue your online data.

10:38.443 --> 10:40.478
Every website you've
ever been to,

10:40.512 --> 10:42.881
every subject you've
ever searched,

10:42.915 --> 10:44.917
every porno you
ever watched...

10:44.950 --> 10:46.051
ROALD: Every text
you've ever sent.

10:46.084 --> 10:50.188
Yanks know it and have it
and, one day, will leak it.

10:50.222 --> 10:51.924
‐Hence our venture into the...
‐BOTH: Dark web.

10:51.957 --> 10:52.958

10:52.991 --> 10:56.061

11:07.039 --> 11:10.508
Did you know that
Yank is kind of not PC now?

11:10.542 --> 11:11.643
Mmm, it's true.

11:11.677 --> 11:14.212
A player in the Ontario
Hockey League got suspended

11:14.246 --> 11:16.949
for calling a European
player a Euro.

11:16.982 --> 11:18.316
Youse can get suspended
for callings

11:18.350 --> 11:19.952
a guys from Europes a Euro?

11:19.985 --> 11:21.119
Happened a couple times.

11:21.153 --> 11:23.555
What Yank came up
with that fucking rule?

11:23.588 --> 11:24.923
I got nothin'
against Yanks.

11:24.957 --> 11:26.124
If Canada was in trouble,

11:26.158 --> 11:28.026
they'd be the first ones to come
up and help us get sorted.

11:28.060 --> 11:29.361
‐Good neighbors.
‐Good film.

11:29.394 --> 11:31.263
‐Don't like Dierks though.
‐Pourquoi?

11:31.296 --> 11:33.198
‐'Cause Wayne doesn't.
‐I'm with you.

11:33.231 --> 11:34.632
Don't be a fence sitter.

11:34.666 --> 11:36.301
Yeah, gotta come out
for it one way or another.

11:36.334 --> 11:38.470
Yeah, that Yank
better behave himself,

11:38.503 --> 11:39.537
'cause if Katy is in trouble,

11:39.571 --> 11:41.173
I'll fucking
speed‐bag him, boys.

11:41.206 --> 11:42.474
I'd go to the wall
for that girl.

11:42.507 --> 11:44.176
I'd go through a wall
for that girl.

11:44.209 --> 11:45.477
‐Full send.
‐Yep.

11:45.510 --> 11:47.379
That's small towns
in a snow globes for yas.

11:47.412 --> 11:49.481
‐Boy howdy.
‐Yeah.

11:49.514 --> 11:51.383
We might bicker
with each other on the inside,

11:51.416 --> 11:53.952
but if someone from the outside
comes a knockin'...

11:53.986 --> 11:55.053
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

12:07.065 --> 12:09.234
You didn't have to drive all
the way here to tell me that.

12:09.267 --> 12:10.903
‐But I did.
‐Yeah, well.

12:12.304 --> 12:13.305
Can't win 'em all.

12:14.572 --> 12:16.308
It's not the only
reason I'm here.

12:16.341 --> 12:18.343
‐Oh, way...
‐Is Katy here?

12:18.376 --> 12:19.411
No.

12:19.444 --> 12:22.047
Still with Ol' Long
Dick Dierks?

12:22.080 --> 12:25.984
My cousins had his bachelor
party a couple of days ago.

12:26.018 --> 12:27.986
It was in a strip club
in Montreal,

12:28.020 --> 12:30.155
‐and I went with the boys.
‐Good.

12:30.188 --> 12:32.691
There was a Yank
buying everybody drinks.

12:32.725 --> 12:35.728
And our table
eventually joined his table.

12:35.761 --> 12:39.331
And all his friends were saying
how hot his girlfriend was,

12:39.364 --> 12:41.633
and one of them
pulled a picture on his phone.

12:42.634 --> 12:44.036
It was Katy.

12:44.069 --> 12:45.270
Ain't no reason
to get excited.

12:45.303 --> 12:46.705
They came in with
a bunch of girls.

12:48.040 --> 12:49.574
And left with
a bunch of girls.

12:51.376 --> 12:52.978
He doing anything
he shouldn't be?

12:57.282 --> 12:58.583
It's been a tough go, eh?

13:01.619 --> 13:02.688
Yep.

13:02.721 --> 13:04.056
Getting any easier?

13:07.025 --> 13:08.026
Yep.

13:11.129 --> 13:12.630
(EXHALES LOUDLY)

13:13.065 --> 13:14.666
Hearing you fellas
talk about Yanks,

13:14.700 --> 13:17.402
reminds me of my last
boys trip down McMyrtle Beach.

13:17.435 --> 13:19.204
I ever tell you about
a little girls' trip

13:19.237 --> 13:20.405
down McMayan Riviera?

13:20.438 --> 13:22.140
Next year, she's gonna
be down McMaui.

13:22.174 --> 13:24.076
Next year, she's down
McMontego Bay.

13:24.109 --> 13:26.144
Rooftop, poolside, villas.

13:26.178 --> 13:28.613
‐Well, between us girls?
‐Between us girls?

13:28.646 --> 13:30.382
I paddle up
to the swim‐up bar

13:30.415 --> 13:32.718
and there's an ethnic fella
lookin' some comely.

13:32.751 --> 13:35.153
Pool is jam packed
with ethnicities.

13:35.187 --> 13:37.489
This young fella sees me
looking at him,

13:37.522 --> 13:40.092
and he sees me across the bar,
and he can tell

13:40.125 --> 13:41.760
I'm lookin' for one
right in the twat.

13:41.794 --> 13:43.561
Three guarantees
in life, fellas.

13:43.595 --> 13:45.363
Death, taxes,

13:45.397 --> 13:48.433
and this gal wantin' one
right in the twat.

13:48.466 --> 13:51.036
Next thing I know, he's paddling
around the swim‐up bar,

13:51.837 --> 13:52.738
what do you think I did?

13:52.771 --> 13:54.006
So I paddle on over
to meet her halfway.

13:54.039 --> 13:56.709
I said, "Young man, ya like
the ass, the tits or the cunt?"

13:56.742 --> 13:58.576
This gal knows a cunt man
when she sees one.

13:58.610 --> 14:00.645
And that's
the right answer.

14:01.313 --> 14:03.315
(ALL LAUGHING)

14:04.316 --> 14:05.517
So she reaches
under the water

14:05.550 --> 14:07.319
and starts givin' me
an over‐the‐pants handy.

14:07.352 --> 14:10.255
Molestation in some circles,
but this fella is here for it.

14:10.288 --> 14:12.124
So we head on over
to the poolside villa,

14:12.157 --> 14:14.592
close the curtains
and I says to her,

14:14.626 --> 14:16.695
"How about I stuff it
right in your snacker?"

14:16.729 --> 14:18.230
Then one in the snapper.

14:18.263 --> 14:20.065
So we start going
back and forth.

14:20.098 --> 14:21.199
‐I'm in her...
‐Snapper.

14:21.900 --> 14:23.201
‐Then he's in my...
‐Snacker.

14:23.235 --> 14:24.402
‐Snapper.
‐Snacker.

14:24.436 --> 14:25.671
‐Snapper!
‐Snacker!

14:25.704 --> 14:26.805
(POPS CHEEK)

14:26.839 --> 14:28.173
Till we're both
making a mess.

14:28.206 --> 14:30.275
We made one hell
of a mess in there.

14:30.308 --> 14:31.810
I hope they had a pressure
washer, that's all I know.

14:31.844 --> 14:33.578
They must have had
a pressure washer or something.

14:33.611 --> 14:35.714
‐Mmm‐hmm.
‐McMURRAY: Mmm‐hmm.

14:37.449 --> 14:39.752
‐DAN: Does Mrs...
‐McMurray know about this?

14:39.785 --> 14:42.254
‐Of course.
‐No secrets between spouses.

14:44.757 --> 14:46.792
You know what
he does sometimes?

14:46.825 --> 14:48.060
He does the cutest
little thing.

14:48.093 --> 14:51.129
I'll go outside the bathroom
door when she's on the shitter.

14:51.163 --> 14:52.297
MRS. McMURRAY: And I'll hear
something outside

14:53.131 --> 14:55.133
that sounds like
a little golf clap.

14:55.167 --> 14:58.170
But it's me standing
out there in the buck, naked,

14:58.203 --> 15:00.372
shaking my hips
back and forth like so...

15:01.439 --> 15:03.575

off his thighs.
