[jazz music]

00:04.830 --> 00:12.830
â™ª â™ª

00:20.329 --> 00:21.929
[cheers and applause]

00:21.929 --> 00:24.769
- From the Penn & Teller
Theater in Las Vegas, Nevada.

00:24.769 --> 00:27.899
Here's your host,
Alyson Hannigan!

00:27.899 --> 00:30.100
[cheers and applause]

00:30.100 --> 00:36.729
â™ª â™ª

00:36.729 --> 00:38.329
- Thank you.

00:38.329 --> 00:45.070
[cheers and applause]

00:45.070 --> 00:47.429
Welcome to
"Penn & Teller: Fool Us,"

00:47.429 --> 00:51.070
a show filmed at the
Rio All-Suites Hotel and Casino

00:51.070 --> 00:52.729
here in Las Vegas.

00:52.729 --> 00:55.100
You know, last time
I was in Sin City,

00:55.100 --> 00:57.200
my kids didn't exist yet.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.600
And neither did hand sanitizer.

00:59.600 --> 01:01.170
Yeah.

01:01.170 --> 01:05.099
Well, now that I'm back,
I am very thankful for both.

01:05.099 --> 01:08.200
Tonight, our contenders
are trying to beat the odds

01:08.200 --> 01:11.700
and hit the jackpot by fooling
the pit bosses of magic.

01:11.700 --> 01:13.200
And here they are now,

01:13.200 --> 01:14.930
Penn and Teller!

01:14.930 --> 01:17.930
[cheers and applause]

01:17.930 --> 01:23.730
â™ª â™ª

01:23.730 --> 01:25.700
[squeals]

01:25.700 --> 01:28.700
[cheers and applause]

01:38.599 --> 01:41.099
Oh, there's a lot
at stake tonight.

01:41.099 --> 01:43.530
Any magician who fools
Penn and Teller

01:43.530 --> 01:46.530
gets the life-changing
opportunity to perform

01:46.530 --> 01:48.170
in their Las Vegas show.

01:48.170 --> 01:51.329
So let's meet our first
potential fooler.

01:51.329 --> 01:53.329
[explosion]

01:53.329 --> 01:55.569
- My name is Timon,
I'm from Amsterdam,

01:55.569 --> 01:57.099
and I am a mind reader.

01:57.099 --> 01:58.530
â™ª â™ª

01:58.530 --> 02:01.129
So when I was 12,
I saw a hypnosis show

02:01.129 --> 02:03.069
in the holiday park,
and I was really fascinated

02:03.069 --> 02:05.230
by it, so I basically
went ahead and I copied

02:05.230 --> 02:06.230
what I saw onstage.

02:06.230 --> 02:07.329
And it worked.

02:07.329 --> 02:09.500
And I started
hypnotizing people.

02:09.500 --> 02:11.199
What I'm interested
in in mind reading

02:11.199 --> 02:13.930
is creating an
actual magical moment.

02:13.930 --> 02:16.069
I don't mean that I'm trying to
fool people into believing

02:16.069 --> 02:17.930
that I can talk to
the dead or anything,

02:17.930 --> 02:19.270
I just want them
to have an experience

02:19.270 --> 02:22.099
where they start to think,
"Well, maybe that was magical."

02:22.099 --> 02:24.030
I want to break away
from the mystical

02:24.030 --> 02:25.729
and dark mentalism style,

02:25.729 --> 02:28.829
and I'm just trying to take it
into something lighthearted.

02:28.829 --> 02:31.199
The audience senses
when you're not being genuine.

02:31.199 --> 02:32.900
I think that's
the most important part.

02:32.900 --> 02:36.729
[cheers and applause]

02:36.729 --> 02:39.770
- Please welcome
Timon Krause.

02:39.770 --> 02:42.069
[cheers and applause]

02:42.069 --> 02:43.699
- Thank you.

02:43.699 --> 02:44.900
Good afternoon all of you.

02:44.900 --> 02:46.699
It's really good to see you.

02:46.699 --> 02:49.170
Now, before we get into this,
I'd like to share with you

02:49.170 --> 02:51.530
a piece of Amsterdam culture.

02:51.530 --> 02:54.170
So if you wouldn't mind,
extend your hands to the front.

02:54.170 --> 02:57.170
Thumbs out.

02:59.870 --> 03:02.199
This, in Amsterdam,
we call "the awkward turtle."

03:02.199 --> 03:03.199
[laughter]

03:03.199 --> 03:04.000
But there's more.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.400
Bear with me,
the awkward rabbit,

03:05.400 --> 03:06.900
the awkward rabbits.

03:06.900 --> 03:08.169
The really awkward rabbits.

03:08.169 --> 03:10.830
[laughter]

03:10.830 --> 03:13.069
And my absolutely favorite,
it's kind of a team animal,

03:13.069 --> 03:15.169
so maybe Alyson, would you mind
helping me with that?

03:15.169 --> 03:16.430
- Sure.
- Lovely. I'm Timon.

03:16.430 --> 03:17.770
How're you doing?
- Hi.

03:17.770 --> 03:19.099
- Come stand at my side.
- Yes.

03:19.099 --> 03:20.670
- If you extend
your hands like this.

03:20.670 --> 03:23.199
- Yes.
- It's the awkward cow.

03:23.199 --> 03:24.199
[laughter]

03:24.199 --> 03:25.729
It's very,
very awkward.

03:25.729 --> 03:27.170
[applause]

03:27.170 --> 03:31.670
My name is Timon,
and I am a mind reader.

03:31.670 --> 03:34.199
And being a mind reader,
I know what you're thinking.

03:34.199 --> 03:36.099
You want to have a go, as well?
- Sure.

03:36.099 --> 03:37.430
- You go ahead.
- Oh, it's nice.

03:37.430 --> 03:39.030
- Feels good?
- Yeah.

03:39.030 --> 03:41.099
- You might be wondering
where this is leading.

03:41.099 --> 03:43.099
Uh, I don't know.

03:43.099 --> 03:45.199
Alyson, as a mind reader,
I really want to know

03:45.199 --> 03:46.829
the way people think.

03:46.829 --> 03:48.670
So what we just did,
it's not just something

03:48.670 --> 03:51.370
that's just a cute finger game,
it's also something

03:51.370 --> 03:54.870
that I like to call
the "cow test."

03:54.870 --> 03:58.199
Tell me, Alyson,
what did you enjoy more,

03:58.199 --> 04:01.770
did you enjoy milking more,
or being milked by me?

04:01.770 --> 04:04.500
[laughter]

04:04.500 --> 04:05.599
- Uh...

04:05.599 --> 04:08.370
I think I enjoyed
milking more.

04:08.370 --> 04:10.199
- Is your husband
in the audience tonight?

04:10.199 --> 04:11.699
- No.
- No. Is he aware of this?

04:11.699 --> 04:14.699
- Um, I think that's
why he married me.

04:14.699 --> 04:16.600
[laughter]

04:16.600 --> 04:18.170
- Lovely.

04:18.170 --> 04:20.430
Well, okay, seeing that we
already got to know each other

04:20.430 --> 04:23.329
a little bit now, would you
offer me your assistance

04:23.329 --> 04:25.769
for the next few minutes?
- Sure.

04:25.769 --> 04:27.569
- In that case, I'd like to
invite you for a game.

04:27.569 --> 04:28.930
- Okay.

04:28.930 --> 04:31.199
- It's a very simple game
that I like to call

04:31.199 --> 04:33.199
"You've Got No Choice."

04:33.199 --> 04:35.100
- [giggles]
Okay.

04:35.100 --> 04:37.029
- I would ask you if you want
to play, but it's not really

04:37.029 --> 04:38.029
in the spirit of the game.

04:38.029 --> 04:39.430
- Right.

04:39.430 --> 04:41.829
I will tell you
that I do have a lawyer,

04:41.829 --> 04:43.199
but go ahead, yes,
I'll play.

04:43.199 --> 04:44.370
- That is fine,
- All right.

04:44.370 --> 04:45.600
- We're just gonna
play, okay?

04:45.600 --> 04:46.829
The game is very simple.

04:46.829 --> 04:48.529
All you need to do
is to hide this coin

04:48.529 --> 04:50.069
behind your back
in one of your hands.

04:50.069 --> 04:53.000
Then bring your hands out so no
one can see where the coin is.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.529
But you can't
change hands anymore.

04:54.529 --> 04:55.769
So extend your hands.
- Okay.

04:55.769 --> 04:57.199
- I'm gonna hide it in
one of your hands.

04:57.199 --> 04:58.699
- Okay.
- Then bring your hands out.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.170
So no one can see
where the coin is,

05:00.170 --> 05:01.600
but you can't change
hands anymore.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.769
I will try and influence you
four times in a row

05:03.769 --> 05:06.000
so that each time I will be able
to tell you where the coin is.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.529
- Okay.

05:07.529 --> 05:09.870
- So before you make a decision
on where to put the coin,

05:09.870 --> 05:10.930
I'll need to influence you.

05:10.930 --> 05:12.170
- Okay.
- So look into my eyes.

05:12.170 --> 05:13.829
- I'm looking.

05:13.829 --> 05:15.730
- And it already happened,
ladies and gentlemen,

05:15.730 --> 05:17.100
okay, it already happened.

05:17.100 --> 05:18.829
And once you're ready,
bring your hands out.

05:18.829 --> 05:20.170
- Okay.

05:20.170 --> 05:21.930
- And now, you could have gone
for the right hand

05:21.930 --> 05:24.199
or for the left hand, but most
women, when they look into

05:24.199 --> 05:26.899
my eyes for long enough,
have a tendency to take the coin

05:26.899 --> 05:28.500
into the left hand
in the first round.

05:28.500 --> 05:29.899
Yes. Lovely.

05:29.899 --> 05:32.829
It was one out of four,
but could have been 50/50.

05:32.829 --> 05:34.170
So we'll go for the next round.
- Okay.

05:34.170 --> 05:35.899
- Hide it again.

05:35.899 --> 05:39.000
And I'd like you to know that
most women in the second round

05:39.000 --> 05:41.569
will put the coin into
the same hand again.

05:41.569 --> 05:43.170
- Ah.

05:43.170 --> 05:45.230
- I don't want to influence you,
I'm just saying, okay?

05:45.230 --> 05:47.069
So when you're ready--
- Wait, wait, wait.

05:47.069 --> 05:49.029
But I hadn't chosen yet.
- You hadn't chosen yet?

05:49.029 --> 05:50.670
So when you're ready,
bring your hands out.

05:50.670 --> 05:52.170
- Okay.
[giggles]

05:52.170 --> 05:54.170
- And now, if it was you,
you could be thinking,

05:54.170 --> 05:56.029
Timon says I'm supposed to go
for the right hand,

05:56.029 --> 05:57.370
so I'm gonna go
for the left hand.

05:57.370 --> 05:59.170
But of course, you know that I
know that you know that I know

05:59.170 --> 06:00.800
that most people would do that,
so if it was you,

06:00.800 --> 06:02.670
it'd actually go two steps
forward or three steps back

06:02.670 --> 06:04.230
doing that thing which is so
logical it actually becomes

06:04.230 --> 06:06.000
illogical to do that because
you're trying to catch me,

06:06.000 --> 06:07.170
I'd actually go for
the right hand this time.

06:07.170 --> 06:08.269
Yes.

06:08.269 --> 06:09.699
That's two out of four.
Thank you.

06:09.699 --> 06:12.100
- That is so true.

06:12.100 --> 06:13.399
All right.

06:13.399 --> 06:16.399
- Alyson, we're going to do
the exact same thing again

06:16.399 --> 06:18.699
and then we're going
to change things up a little.

06:18.699 --> 06:20.870
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
Alyson might feel like

06:20.870 --> 06:22.670
she's still got a free choice,

06:22.670 --> 06:24.529
but that's not the case,
it's already happened.

06:24.529 --> 06:26.029
And I'll tell you
where in a moment.

06:26.029 --> 06:27.670
So once you're ready,
bring your hands out.

06:27.670 --> 06:29.000
And I'm not sure if
you heard me say it,

06:29.000 --> 06:31.430
but I said we're going to do
the exact same thing again.

06:31.430 --> 06:33.529
And that's what you did,
you did the same thing again.

06:33.529 --> 06:35.000
It's your right hand
again, yes?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.399
Got a three out of four.
Thank you.

06:36.399 --> 06:37.730
[applause]

06:37.730 --> 06:40.529
Now, Alyson...

06:40.529 --> 06:43.000
for the last round,
I've got a prediction

06:43.000 --> 06:47.100
stating if you will choose right
or left in the last round.

06:47.100 --> 06:50.069
I will not give you any hints,
but be painfully aware

06:50.069 --> 06:53.670
of the fact that this round
is the last one left.

06:53.670 --> 06:55.029
[laughter]

06:55.029 --> 06:57.100
So when you're ready,
bring your hands out.

06:57.100 --> 06:58.699
You've got them--
keep your hands closed.

06:58.699 --> 07:00.970
And let's take a look at what
the prediction says.

07:00.970 --> 07:03.199
I predicted that Alyson,
in the first round,

07:03.199 --> 07:05.230
would go for left,
and that was correct.

07:05.230 --> 07:07.100
In the second round,
she would go for right.

07:07.100 --> 07:08.269
That was correct, as well.

07:08.269 --> 07:10.199
In the third round,
she would go for right,

07:10.199 --> 07:12.100
and that was correct.

07:12.100 --> 07:14.069
And I predicted that
in the last round,

07:14.069 --> 07:16.230
I will influence Alyson
to go for right again.

07:16.230 --> 07:17.699
Alyson, show us where the--

07:17.699 --> 07:18.769
it's four out of four.

07:18.769 --> 07:21.329
Thank you.
- Oh, my God.

07:21.329 --> 07:23.069
- Thank you, Alyson.
- That was so cool.

07:23.069 --> 07:26.699
- It was a pleasure.
- Wow, Timon!

07:26.699 --> 07:29.230
Amazing!
Wow.

07:29.230 --> 07:31.569
[applause]

07:31.569 --> 07:33.170
That was so cool.

07:33.170 --> 07:35.000
- Thanks, I'm glad
you enjoyed it.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.199
- Well, and what's really cool
is that, when you were

07:37.199 --> 07:39.329
saying, "Oh, then they
go for the left,"

07:39.329 --> 07:41.230
in my mind, I was like,
"I'm gonna go for the left."

07:41.230 --> 07:42.600
And then you said that,
I'm like,

07:42.600 --> 07:44.100
"Oh, well now I'm gonna
go for the right."

07:44.100 --> 07:45.430
- It's freaky, isn't it?
- Yes!

07:45.430 --> 07:47.170
- Like, I always
think that, as well.

07:47.170 --> 07:48.899
- Yeah, that was very crazy.

07:48.899 --> 07:50.170
You were in my mind.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.500
How did you do that?

07:52.500 --> 07:55.029
So can you, uh,
read their minds?

07:55.029 --> 07:56.430
Do you think you can fool them?
- I cannot.

07:56.430 --> 07:58.329
I cannot, but I hope people
enjoyed themselves.

07:58.329 --> 08:00.170
That'd be great.
- Oh.

08:00.170 --> 08:01.699
Well, I--I mean--

08:01.699 --> 08:04.170
I'm no mind reader,
but I can tell

08:04.170 --> 08:05.569
you entertained us,
definitely.

08:05.569 --> 08:07.870
All right,
let's go to the boys.

08:07.870 --> 08:08.870
- Okay.

08:08.870 --> 08:10.730
- Penn, Teller.
- Yes?

08:10.730 --> 08:12.170
- Hello.

08:12.170 --> 08:14.930
Would you like to tell us
what's on your mind?

08:14.930 --> 08:17.769
- You know,
the problem with mentalism,

08:17.769 --> 08:20.170
and boy, are there a lot of
problems with mentalism,

08:20.170 --> 08:21.730
one of the problems
with mentalism--

08:21.730 --> 08:22.730
- I apologize.

08:22.730 --> 08:24.829
- Is they always
end up with these

08:24.829 --> 08:28.170
incredibly complicated things,
you know?

08:28.170 --> 08:31.269
And the question you always
want to ask a mentalist is,

08:31.269 --> 08:33.870
"What am I thinking?" or
"Which hand is it in?"

08:33.870 --> 08:36.370
And that's what's great
about this routine,

08:36.370 --> 08:40.730
is it really does go to the idea
of what it would be like

08:40.730 --> 08:42.029
if you could read minds.

08:42.029 --> 08:44.330
Now, the two things
we're sure of

08:44.330 --> 08:46.000
is that you weren't
reading her mind

08:46.000 --> 08:47.370
and you weren't
influencing her.

08:47.370 --> 08:49.029
After that,
it gets a little tougher.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.500
[laughs]
- Lovely.

08:51.500 --> 08:56.200
- There is a few ways that
the final ending could've gone.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.330
And you were covered
for all of those.

08:58.330 --> 09:02.200
But the more interesting
thing that fascinates me

09:02.200 --> 09:04.600
is, you know,
I wear this ring.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.830
For my dad, it's for
sentimental reasons.

09:06.830 --> 09:09.870
And I wear this ring,
and I think my dad

09:09.870 --> 09:13.169
would have approved
very much of this trick

09:13.169 --> 09:14.600
and me wearing his ring.

09:14.600 --> 09:17.500
So I'm gonna kind of
dedicate the whole kind of

09:17.500 --> 09:19.100
bust to my dad.

09:19.100 --> 09:22.029
My dad was a coin dealer
and a jail guard

09:22.029 --> 09:24.200
and also wore this ring.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.269
- To be honest, I think my dad
would not approve.

09:26.269 --> 09:28.500
- He wouldn't?
- He would not approve at all.

09:28.500 --> 09:29.899
- He wouldn't?
- No, he wouldn't.

09:29.899 --> 09:32.200
- Does your dad not like
jewelry, or is that a code word?

09:32.200 --> 09:34.399
- My dad does not like jewelry,
and he would not approve.

09:34.399 --> 09:35.700
- [laughs]
- Wait, wait, wait.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.169
So the ring's
not the thing--

09:37.169 --> 09:40.029
you're saying that maybe what
they guessed is not the right--

09:40.029 --> 09:41.700
- No.
- Guess?

09:41.700 --> 09:43.200
- The ring ain't no thing?

09:43.200 --> 09:45.029
- No, no, like--
- Wait, wait.

09:45.029 --> 09:46.330
- Dad wouldn't approve.
- What?

09:46.330 --> 09:47.899
Dad wouldn't approve,
so does that--

09:47.899 --> 09:49.669
- Dad wouldn't approve,
so you have fooled us.

09:49.669 --> 09:51.429
- Yay!
- Yeah!

09:51.429 --> 09:53.000
- Whoo!

09:53.000 --> 09:54.929
- Thank you.

09:54.929 --> 09:57.370
- Wonderful, wonderful.
- [overlapping chatter]

09:57.370 --> 09:59.899
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

09:59.899 --> 10:01.070
- We have a fooler!

10:01.070 --> 10:03.000
- Wonderful.
- Thank you.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.169
- Oh.

10:05.169 --> 10:06.029
- Thanks for having me.

10:06.029 --> 10:08.169
- Timon!
Yes!

10:08.169 --> 10:11.169
Ladies and gentlemen.
You fooled Penn and Teller.

10:11.169 --> 10:14.370
[cheers and applause]

10:14.370 --> 10:16.330
Our first fooler
of the night.

10:16.330 --> 10:20.169
More magic and maybe more
foolers coming up after this.

10:20.169 --> 10:23.169
[jazz music]

10:23.169 --> 10:24.899
â™ª â™ª

10:29.700 --> 10:32.700
[jazz music]

10:32.700 --> 10:35.700
[applause]

10:43.929 --> 10:47.200
[cheers and applause]

10:47.200 --> 10:49.730
- [muffled]
Welcome bac--

10:49.730 --> 10:51.700
[cheers and applause]

10:51.700 --> 10:54.669
Welcome back to "Fool Us."

10:54.669 --> 10:57.029
Let's meet our next magician.

10:57.029 --> 11:00.100
[explosion]

11:03.029 --> 11:04.669
- My name's Kyle Marlett,
and I live in

11:04.669 --> 11:06.000
Las Vegas, Nevada.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.769
I think magic is more powerful
with things that we all know.

11:08.769 --> 11:12.200
The magic I do, normally,
is all with organic items,

11:12.200 --> 11:13.529
like items you find
around the house.

11:13.529 --> 11:16.269
Cups and shaving cream,
and things like that.

11:16.269 --> 11:18.570
Both my mom and dad
have been very supportive,

11:18.570 --> 11:21.500
but my dad, he loves magic,
and he hasn't really got to

11:21.500 --> 11:24.169
see me on TV a lot, but he's
actually gonna be at "Fool Us."

11:24.169 --> 11:27.700
I'm very excited about it
and it's a really great

11:27.700 --> 11:31.669
opportunity, because recently my
dad was diagnosed with cancer.

11:31.669 --> 11:35.200
So for me to go out and try to
fool Penn and Teller,

11:35.200 --> 11:38.070
this is the first time he's
been able to see me shine

11:38.070 --> 11:40.870
in this big of a surrounding.

11:40.870 --> 11:42.370
I know he's gonna love it.

11:42.370 --> 11:45.029
Just having him there
in the audience,

11:45.029 --> 11:47.830
it's going to be a really
special moment for me

11:47.830 --> 11:50.200
to show him that everything
that I've accomplished

11:50.200 --> 11:52.529
is because of the support
that they've given me.

11:52.529 --> 11:55.529
[cheers and applause]

11:56.830 --> 11:59.529
- Please welcome
Kyle Marlett.

11:59.529 --> 12:01.330
[cheers and applause]

12:01.330 --> 12:03.399
- What is up, everyone?

12:03.399 --> 12:07.730
Uh, my name is Kyle Marlett
and I am a magician.

12:07.730 --> 12:08.730
[laughter]

12:08.730 --> 12:10.070
Thank you.

12:10.070 --> 12:12.000
Uh, tonight, we're gonna do
something really awesome

12:12.000 --> 12:13.500
and I need the help
from two people.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.230
And I thought the lovely Alyson
might be able to help me,

12:15.230 --> 12:16.769
and the lovely Penn
might be able to help me.

12:16.769 --> 12:18.029
Give them both
a round of applause.

12:18.029 --> 12:19.169
[cheers and applause]

12:19.169 --> 12:20.700
Nice to see you.

12:20.700 --> 12:22.100
Penn, good to see you again.

12:22.100 --> 12:24.330
Have a seat,
relax, chill out.

12:24.330 --> 12:26.000
Uh, doing good?
 You know each other.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.230
- We do, we do.
- You go way back.

12:27.230 --> 12:28.429
All right.

12:28.429 --> 12:30.169
So I have a deck
of cards here, all different,

12:30.169 --> 12:31.500
all mixed up.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.669
All different, all mixed up,
all different, mixed up.

12:33.669 --> 12:35.399
Now, I need one of you
to pick a card.

12:35.399 --> 12:37.669
But here's the thing--
I don't want to play favorites.

12:37.669 --> 12:39.200
I don't want to be that guy.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.200
I don't want to be that guy,
so I thought the best way

12:41.200 --> 12:43.169
for you guys to decide
who picks the card

12:43.169 --> 12:46.929
is to play a quick one round
game of rock paper scissors.

12:46.929 --> 12:48.070
So get in the
starting position.

12:48.070 --> 12:50.000
- Okay, good.
- Ready?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.429
- I'm gonna throw rock,
just so you know.

12:51.429 --> 12:52.669
- [laughs]

12:52.669 --> 12:54.269
- Okay, so I am gonna throw
rock, so be ready.

12:54.269 --> 12:55.769
Okay, ready?
- All right.

12:55.769 --> 12:57.769
- I think he's messing with you.
- I think he is, too.

12:57.769 --> 12:59.100
- I'm gonna throw rock.
- Okay, ready?

12:59.100 --> 13:01.200
Set...go!

13:01.200 --> 13:02.200
Oh.
- Oh!

13:02.200 --> 13:04.830
- He said he was
gonna do it!

13:04.830 --> 13:05.899
- I want him--
- He said.

13:05.899 --> 13:07.230
- I know!

13:07.230 --> 13:08.830
[applause]

13:08.830 --> 13:11.269
- That's the way it's played,
just so you know.

13:11.269 --> 13:12.899
- He said he was gonna.

13:12.899 --> 13:14.370
Alyson,
we all can't be winners.

13:14.370 --> 13:15.700
- I know.
- Sorry.

13:15.700 --> 13:17.070
Uh, now Penn,
I'm gonna riffle my thumb down

13:17.070 --> 13:18.169
the side of the deck, I just
want you to call out

13:18.169 --> 13:19.429
"stop" whenever you want.

13:19.429 --> 13:20.429
- Stop!
- Right there?

13:20.429 --> 13:22.100
- Yeah.
- Great.

13:22.100 --> 13:23.429
Now, I want you to notice this
is the card you're gonna get.

13:23.429 --> 13:25.429
That's the card you stopped at,
the king of hearts.

13:25.429 --> 13:27.500
Now, you guys can probably tell,
but the people here

13:27.500 --> 13:29.700
in the theater
and the people at home might not

13:29.700 --> 13:32.000
be able to notice
that I work out.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.669
[laughter]

13:34.669 --> 13:36.200
Why are you laughing?
- [giggles]

13:36.200 --> 13:38.700
- Uh, I will prove that by
taking your card,

13:38.700 --> 13:39.899
the king of hearts.

13:39.899 --> 13:41.230
And Alyson,
I'm gonna tear this card.

13:41.230 --> 13:43.730
But I want you to see in here
that I'm actually

13:43.730 --> 13:45.230
tearing this card, okay?

13:45.230 --> 13:46.269
[paper ripping]

13:46.269 --> 13:47.269
You can hear it?
- Yeah.

13:47.269 --> 13:48.529
You can see it?
Penn.

13:48.529 --> 13:51.000
You can see and hear.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.830
Hear ripping the card, right?
- Looks that way, yeah.

13:52.830 --> 13:54.169
- When I finish it--but here's
the thing, I don't want to

13:54.169 --> 13:55.500
finish the tear all the way,
I want to leave it on

13:55.500 --> 13:56.929
just a little bit.

13:56.929 --> 13:58.830
And that's because
I want you to finish the tear.

13:58.830 --> 14:01.169
'Cause I don't want you to think
I'm doing any monkey business

14:01.169 --> 14:02.330
or anything like that.
- No monkey business.

14:02.330 --> 14:04.100
- Okay, so go ahead
and finish the tear.

14:04.100 --> 14:05.730
- I take it?
- Yeah, go ahead.

14:05.730 --> 14:07.230
That really came from
that card, right?

14:07.230 --> 14:09.000
- Sure seems it.
- Do you lift?

14:09.000 --> 14:11.169
'Cause that was impressive.

14:11.169 --> 14:13.269
So hold on to that corner, we're
gonna get to you in a moment.

14:13.269 --> 14:14.899
But I'm gonna take your card,
the king of hearts,

14:14.899 --> 14:16.200
missing the corner.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.500
It goes right here
in the middle of the deck, yes?

14:18.500 --> 14:20.100
And I'm gonna put it right here,
and I'm not gonna touch it.

14:20.100 --> 14:21.169
And you can keep an eye on it,
if you want.

14:21.169 --> 14:23.200
- I will.
- You guys drink tea?

14:23.200 --> 14:24.200
Are you a tea drinker?
- I do drink tea.

14:24.200 --> 14:26.169
- You drink tea. Great.
So I didn't know what--

14:26.169 --> 14:27.070
we're gonna make a cup of tea,
but I didn't know what

14:27.070 --> 14:29.370
type of tea
you guys liked, so I brought

14:29.370 --> 14:31.570
five different
flavors of tea.

14:31.570 --> 14:33.570
Excuse me, pardon me.
Perfect.

14:33.570 --> 14:35.070
Five different flavors, right?
- Yeah!

14:35.070 --> 14:38.070
- We have green, mint, lemon,
peach, and black.

14:38.070 --> 14:40.529
Now, each tin has about
20 or so tea bags in it.

14:40.529 --> 14:41.730
- Okay.

14:41.730 --> 14:44.230
- That gives you guys
the option of over 2,000

14:44.230 --> 14:45.769
tea bags to choose from.

14:45.769 --> 14:47.230
[laughter]

14:47.230 --> 14:49.769
I thought if my trick didn't
fool you, my math would.

14:49.769 --> 14:51.399
So obviously not.

14:51.399 --> 14:53.429
Now, Penn,
there's five tins of tea,

14:53.429 --> 14:55.169
go ahead and pick
whatever one you want.

14:55.169 --> 14:57.669
It doesn't matter.
- Well, I will pick--

14:57.669 --> 14:58.899
- Go ahead.
Yeah, go ahead.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.730
- I'll pick mint.
- Go ahead and take it.

15:00.730 --> 15:02.830
And we don't need these.
- No, we don't.

15:02.830 --> 15:04.769
- Okay, uh...

15:04.769 --> 15:06.029
and...

15:06.029 --> 15:07.399
- You don't need that, no.
- We don't need that.

15:07.399 --> 15:09.370
Okay, so do me a favor--
open it up.

15:09.370 --> 15:11.399
- I will.

15:11.399 --> 15:13.000
- You're very strong.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.169
Okay, you can see there's a
bunch of bags of tea, right?

15:15.169 --> 15:16.269
- Yeah.
- Yes? Smell it?

15:16.269 --> 15:18.600
- That smell of mint is nice.
- Only the best for you.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.000
All right, do me a favor,
reach your hand out

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
and offer Alyson a tea bag.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.399
- Alyson, would you
like a tea bag?

15:23.399 --> 15:24.399
- [giggles]

15:24.399 --> 15:26.669
Why, thank you, Penn.

15:26.669 --> 15:28.200
- That came off way worse than
I thought it was going to.

15:28.200 --> 15:29.929
- Yeah.
- Okay, uh...

15:29.929 --> 15:31.429
Okay, so, do you want to
change your mind?

15:31.429 --> 15:32.669
You can change your mind.

15:32.669 --> 15:35.070
- Uh, to not take
Penn's tea bag?

15:35.070 --> 15:37.899
- [laughs]

15:37.899 --> 15:39.200
- This is going a whole
different direction.

15:39.200 --> 15:40.830
- Yes.

15:40.830 --> 15:43.200
- Whole different direction
than I thought it was going to.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.769
- Picked the wrong two people,
that's all.

15:44.769 --> 15:46.029
- But that's the one
you want, yeah?

15:46.029 --> 15:47.029
- Uh, sure.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.399
- Okay, you can
change your mind.

15:48.399 --> 15:49.769
- No, I'm happy with
this tea bag.

15:49.769 --> 15:53.169
Penn, we, uh, we don't--
we don't--

15:53.169 --> 15:54.700
We don't--okay, good.
Perfect.

15:54.700 --> 15:56.769
Uh, now I also have a cup.

15:56.769 --> 15:57.830
Yes.
Empty cup.

15:57.830 --> 15:59.700
- That's a cup.
- Empty cup, yes?

15:59.700 --> 16:01.269
Uh, with your left hand, do you
mind holding it by the handle?

16:01.269 --> 16:02.500
- The, uh, yes.
- Yeah, you're left hand.

16:02.500 --> 16:05.200
Perfect. Uh, now I want you
to hold it up

16:05.200 --> 16:07.269
like you're toasting Penn--
like you're like, "cheers."

16:07.269 --> 16:09.200
So, uh, do me a favor,
hold it up just like that.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.370
Don't move.
Can you hold it?

16:10.370 --> 16:12.029
- Uh, yeah.
- Perfect.

16:12.029 --> 16:14.570
We're gonna take the wrapper,
and Penn, you can have that.

16:14.570 --> 16:16.000
That's for you,
you're welcome.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.669
Uh, and you can have the rest
of it, you're welcome.

16:17.669 --> 16:19.070
And we're gonna put
the tea bag inside.

16:19.070 --> 16:21.200
And can you put your thumb on it
so it doesn't fall in like that?

16:21.200 --> 16:22.669
Perfect.

16:22.669 --> 16:24.830
Now, I have some warm water.
It's not hot, don't worry.

16:24.830 --> 16:26.169
- Oh, jeez.

16:26.169 --> 16:29.100
- I'm sure we have
liability here somewhere.

16:29.100 --> 16:30.269
Okay.

16:30.269 --> 16:32.399
- Are you trying to pass off
making tea as dangerous?

16:32.399 --> 16:33.830
- You feel the steam?
- [giggles]

16:33.830 --> 16:36.100
- It's like a sauna. Okay.
- It's lovely.

16:36.100 --> 16:37.399
- So that's it.

16:37.399 --> 16:39.200
- Good!
- Thank you.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.070
Uh--no, no, no.
I forgot about your card.

16:41.070 --> 16:43.200
Okay, so you picked the king
of spades--uh, hearts.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.269
- King of hearts.

16:44.269 --> 16:45.370
- This decks' been here
the whole time?

16:45.370 --> 16:46.769
- It has been,
haven't touched it.

16:46.769 --> 16:49.000
- I haven't touched it,
like I want you to see.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.529
Is it hot?
You got it?

16:50.529 --> 16:52.029
- It's fine, I'm okay.
- Man up, it's cool.

16:52.029 --> 16:53.870
- [laughs]
- Okay, here we go.

16:53.870 --> 16:56.029
Uh, if you don't mind.
- Oh, sorry.

16:56.029 --> 16:59.070
You can now see that
that king of hearts

16:59.070 --> 17:00.570
is completely gone.

17:00.570 --> 17:04.400
We have the king of diamonds,
king of clubs, king of--

17:04.400 --> 17:06.368
we have king of everything
but the hearts, right?

17:06.368 --> 17:09.098
Like, it's gone.
Alyson, here, you can see.

17:09.098 --> 17:10.769
Yes?
Yeah?

17:10.769 --> 17:12.170
- Uh, yes.
- Great.

17:12.170 --> 17:14.569
And we don't need these.

17:14.569 --> 17:17.000
I like to throw things.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.868
Now, Alyson, I haven't touched
that cup, right?

17:18.868 --> 17:20.329
- Uh, no.
- Penn hasn't touched that cup.

17:20.329 --> 17:21.529
- Uh, no.
- No.

17:21.529 --> 17:23.569
- You would know if two dudes
came at you

17:23.569 --> 17:24.829
trying to get that cup.

17:24.829 --> 17:26.069
- Right.
- You'd fight us back.

17:26.069 --> 17:27.430
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:27.430 --> 17:29.930
- If you would, with your right
hand, grab the string.

17:29.930 --> 17:34.269
- Yes.
- And slowly pull up.

17:34.269 --> 17:35.730
[audience exclaims]

17:35.730 --> 17:38.599
[cheers and applause]

17:38.599 --> 17:40.369
Okay, go ahead and put
the cup down, it's fine.

17:40.369 --> 17:41.529
I'll take it.

17:41.529 --> 17:45.170
Now, you can see
that there's a card.

17:45.170 --> 17:46.869
You can see there's a card
that happens to be

17:46.869 --> 17:48.170
the king of hearts
missing a corner.

17:48.170 --> 17:50.230
You just so happen to be
holding one of the corners.

17:50.230 --> 17:52.730
If you guys would come together.

17:52.730 --> 17:57.200
And see if that matches 100%.

17:57.200 --> 17:58.230
- Wow.

17:58.230 --> 18:00.630
- Right there, ladies
and gentlemen, 100%.

18:00.630 --> 18:02.700
[cheers and applause]

18:02.700 --> 18:04.170
- Wow!
- Thank you very much.

18:04.170 --> 18:05.569
Give these guys
a round of applause.

18:05.569 --> 18:08.230
- Kyle Marlett!
All right.

18:08.230 --> 18:11.170
[cheers and applause]

18:11.170 --> 18:12.529
Whoo!

18:12.529 --> 18:14.000
That was fantastic!
- High five, right?

18:14.000 --> 18:15.230
That went well.
- Yes!

18:15.230 --> 18:17.099
- Except for the whole
tea bag incident.

18:17.099 --> 18:19.200
- [laughs]

18:19.200 --> 18:23.069
I think that's what
we enjoyed a lot, too.

18:23.069 --> 18:25.000
Um, wow,
that was wonderful.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.170
- Thank you.
- Yes.

18:26.170 --> 18:28.000
- It's exciting to be here
in Vegas, right?

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
With you guys.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.930
[cheers and applause]

18:30.930 --> 18:33.200
- And your dad's here in
the audience tonight.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.500
- Yes.
So my pop is here.

18:35.500 --> 18:36.500
Means a lot to me.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.000
He's never seen me, uh--

18:38.000 --> 18:40.230
he's seen video of me doing
stuff, but really hasn't--

18:40.230 --> 18:42.029
- Where is he?
- Uh, right over there.

18:42.029 --> 18:44.170
The guy with the glasses.
- Aw.

18:44.170 --> 18:45.829
[cheers and applause]

18:45.829 --> 18:47.369
Yay.

18:47.369 --> 18:49.930
Aw, look how proud he is.

18:49.930 --> 18:51.069
All right, they're ready.

18:51.069 --> 18:52.400
I'm gonna check in with them.
- Great.

18:52.400 --> 18:56.170
- All right,
Mr. Penn, Mr. Teller.

18:56.170 --> 18:58.670
- Um, your dad should be very,
very proud.

18:58.670 --> 19:00.730
- Thank you.

19:00.730 --> 19:03.069
[cheers and applause]

19:03.069 --> 19:04.670
- Because, uh...

19:04.670 --> 19:07.069
that's got a lot of work
going into it.

19:07.069 --> 19:08.700
- Yeah.
- I mean, a lot

19:08.700 --> 19:10.170
of work going into it.

19:10.170 --> 19:12.230
You know, I do love tea.

19:12.230 --> 19:14.700
And I'll tell ya, you said
something about there being

19:14.700 --> 19:17.029
thousands of tea bags there,
and there weren't, of course.

19:17.029 --> 19:18.400
- Of course.
- That was just a little joke.

19:18.400 --> 19:21.829
But I will tell you, that tea
was very, very special.

19:21.829 --> 19:24.730
And that tea takes a long time
to make that tea.

19:24.730 --> 19:26.829
And when you said
I had a free choice

19:26.829 --> 19:28.829
of any canister, I did.
- Yes.

19:28.829 --> 19:30.869
- And when you said she had
a free choice of any tea bag

19:30.869 --> 19:33.000
in that canister, she did.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.400
But boy,
it was a lot of work.

19:35.400 --> 19:37.430
And I'll tell ya,
it looked like there was

19:37.430 --> 19:41.269
a lot of chance involved,
but I will tell you right now,

19:41.269 --> 19:44.869
the chances that she was gonna
pick the right tea bag

19:44.869 --> 19:48.599
out of the right can with
the right card in it were 100%.

19:48.599 --> 19:51.500
It was all entirely
under your control.

19:51.500 --> 19:56.369
And I want to say something that
actually I think you know,

19:56.369 --> 19:58.329
but you may not know,

19:58.329 --> 20:00.029
and it's fascinating.

20:00.029 --> 20:04.670
Sometimes, magic
and criminal activity

20:04.670 --> 20:07.029
overlap.
[laughter]

20:07.029 --> 20:10.930
In cards, obviously we have
the gambling cheats...

20:10.930 --> 20:12.099
- Sure.
- Who use some of

20:12.099 --> 20:14.430
the same techniques
that card magicians use.

20:14.430 --> 20:17.230
But this technique that you used
with the tea bag

20:17.230 --> 20:20.400
is the technique that has
actually been used

20:20.400 --> 20:23.500
very successfully by people
who are running numbers.

20:23.500 --> 20:24.670
Did you know that?

20:24.670 --> 20:26.099
- I think I know
what you're saying, yes.

20:26.099 --> 20:28.230
- So you think you know
what I'm talking about.

20:28.230 --> 20:31.269
And I think you know that,
although you did a great act

20:31.269 --> 20:32.700
and your dad
should be very proud,

20:32.700 --> 20:35.369
totally original effect
and a lot of work,

20:35.369 --> 20:36.930
maybe the hardest work
of anything

20:36.930 --> 20:39.069
we've seen on this show,
but you didn't fool us.

20:39.069 --> 20:40.700
Is that right?
- That is correct.

20:40.700 --> 20:42.200
- You didn't fool them.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.099
- But I'm honored to be here,
so thank you so much, guys.

20:44.099 --> 20:45.700
- Oh, yeah, it was great.
- Oh, my gosh.

20:45.700 --> 20:48.029
Thank you so much,
you were awesome.

20:48.029 --> 20:49.099
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

20:49.099 --> 20:50.369
Kyle Marlett.

20:50.369 --> 20:52.529
[cheers and applause]

20:52.529 --> 20:54.529
Stick around,
because later in the show,

20:54.529 --> 20:56.769
Penn and Teller
work their magic.

20:56.769 --> 20:59.769
[jazz music]

20:59.769 --> 21:01.769
â™ª â™ª

21:06.400 --> 21:09.400
[jazz music]

21:09.400 --> 21:11.029
[cheers and applause]

21:11.029 --> 21:12.769
- Welcome back to "Fool Us,"

21:12.769 --> 21:16.200
where magical minds duel it out
mano a mano,

21:16.200 --> 21:18.500
or in this case,
duo a duo.

21:18.500 --> 21:19.670
Take a look.

21:19.670 --> 21:22.069
[explosion]

21:22.069 --> 21:24.529
- Hi, we're the Evasons.
- The mentalist duo.

21:24.529 --> 21:27.069
â™ª â™ª

21:27.069 --> 21:29.529
- We met 33 years ago.

21:29.529 --> 21:32.369
- As soon as we met,
we had an instant connection.

21:32.369 --> 21:33.930
- We live together,
we love together,

21:33.930 --> 21:36.029
we work together.
- That's right, 24/7.

21:36.029 --> 21:38.230
â™ª â™ª

21:38.230 --> 21:40.670
- When it comes to mentalism,
Tessa is it.

21:40.670 --> 21:44.170
She is everything a psychic
could possibly be.

21:44.170 --> 21:47.000
- I do have strong
intuitive thoughts.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.670
- She knows what my needs are,
what my desires are.

21:49.670 --> 21:52.269
- It's just a part
of who I am.

21:52.269 --> 21:54.200
- Mentalism is
a branch of magic.

21:54.200 --> 21:55.400
It's magic of the mind.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.769
Magicians defy
the laws of physics

21:57.769 --> 22:01.170
and mind readers defy
the laws of privacy.

22:01.170 --> 22:04.200
â™ª â™ª

22:04.200 --> 22:07.200
[applause]

22:08.430 --> 22:10.869
- This couple
takes their connection

22:10.869 --> 22:12.599
to a whole different level.

22:12.599 --> 22:16.529
Please welcome the Evasons.

22:16.529 --> 22:18.700
- Ever since Tessa
and I first met,

22:18.700 --> 22:21.329
we've always had a strong
connection between us.

22:21.329 --> 22:23.329
- And tonight, we're gonna
connect with you

22:23.329 --> 22:24.569
in the audience.

22:24.569 --> 22:27.000
- So I'm gonna work
with you in the audience,

22:27.000 --> 22:28.400
one-on-one together,

22:28.400 --> 22:30.569
and we're gonna try to send
some of your ideas to Tessa.

22:30.569 --> 22:32.000
Here we go.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
- To make sure that
I don't see what happens,

22:34.000 --> 22:36.069
I'm going to wear
this blindfold.

22:36.069 --> 22:38.329
Watch closely as I put it on.

22:38.329 --> 22:42.230
- This is perfect.
We never met ya.

22:42.230 --> 22:44.700
It not only shuts out
my vision,

22:44.700 --> 22:47.769
it also help to increase
my concentration.

22:47.769 --> 22:50.099
And now we're gonna
give you a little taste

22:50.099 --> 22:53.069
of what it would be like if we
could connect with each other,

22:53.069 --> 22:54.599
thought to thought.

22:54.599 --> 22:56.670
- If you have some objects,
pull them out.

22:56.670 --> 22:57.900
Personal things.

22:57.900 --> 23:00.430
Driver's license,
ID cards, credit cards.

23:00.430 --> 23:02.029
- Oh, I love credit cards.

23:02.029 --> 23:04.000
- Uh, we'll even do cash.
- Oh, that's even better.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
- For your convenience.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.029
Anything personal.
Pull it out.

23:06.029 --> 23:07.700
- Yes, whatever
you have with you.

23:07.700 --> 23:09.230
Any item that
you've carried with you

23:09.230 --> 23:11.069
that has meaning in your life.

23:11.069 --> 23:12.430
That's what we're looking for.

23:12.430 --> 23:14.329
- Can you identify this
now, Tess?

23:14.329 --> 23:16.529
- I'm thinking that
you have a case.

23:16.529 --> 23:19.099
I believe what would be
normally in that case

23:19.099 --> 23:20.500
would be some eyeglasses.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.000
- Yes, you guessed it now.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.829
You guess it.
 Now, that's it.

23:23.829 --> 23:24.869
Definitely.

23:24.869 --> 23:26.599
And it belongs to--
- To this lady.

23:26.599 --> 23:28.269
- This woman.
- Yes.

23:28.269 --> 23:31.269
And I was wondering, ma'am,
some people might call you Viv,

23:31.269 --> 23:32.569
but is it Vivian?

23:32.569 --> 23:34.029
- Is your name Vivian?
- Yes.

23:34.029 --> 23:36.029
- Thank you very much.
Vivian, that's fantastic.

23:36.029 --> 23:37.829
We'll get over to
this side of the room.

23:37.829 --> 23:38.900
We'll get over to this side.

23:38.900 --> 23:40.269
What have you got?

23:40.269 --> 23:42.029
- Very good,
thank you so much.

23:42.029 --> 23:43.769
And that gives you a sense
of the sort of things

23:43.769 --> 23:45.069
we want to
connect with you on.

23:45.069 --> 23:47.569
Things that belong to you,
things that have a story

23:47.569 --> 23:49.029
to tell about your life.

23:49.029 --> 23:50.430
Because I guarantee you,
if you try it,

23:50.430 --> 23:52.230
you'll never forget
this experience.

23:52.230 --> 23:53.230
- Here, describe this now.

23:53.230 --> 23:55.369
There it is.
It's this man.

23:55.369 --> 23:59.269
Now this man is concentrating.
- On this next--

23:59.269 --> 24:01.730
- But I'm hearing sound,
I'm hearing music.

24:01.730 --> 24:04.369
And I think it has something
to do with an instrument.

24:04.369 --> 24:06.670
I think about the
strings of a guitar.

24:06.670 --> 24:09.000
But I believe that might
actually just be the pick.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.500
- That's right.
Yes.

24:11.500 --> 24:13.269
[cheers and applause]

24:13.269 --> 24:15.000
And the color of the pick?

24:15.000 --> 24:17.230
- A bright color,
an orange color.

24:17.230 --> 24:19.000
- It is true, that's it.
You got her attention.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.170
- Wonderful.

24:20.170 --> 24:22.230
I want to take this
on another level, also.

24:22.230 --> 24:24.369
Any other item
that you might have.

24:24.369 --> 24:27.170
- Can you say, uh, this man,
examine his name, Tess?

24:27.170 --> 24:29.200
- Is he thinking
of his name now?

24:29.200 --> 24:32.569
I get an impression of a
name--sounds to me like Cash.

24:32.569 --> 24:34.000
- Is your name Cash?
- Yes.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.869
- It is.
You didn't show me your name.

24:35.869 --> 24:37.170
Never asked you your name.

24:37.170 --> 24:38.569
You've got
something personal?

24:38.569 --> 24:40.069
- Think of what it means to you.

24:40.069 --> 24:43.170
I don't see an item, but I get
a feeling about a person.

24:43.170 --> 24:46.329
I think whatever it is you have
connects you with that person.

24:46.329 --> 24:49.500
In fact, right now,
I'm thinking about some jewelry.

24:49.500 --> 24:51.500
I think it's a watch
that you have.

24:51.500 --> 24:53.170
- See, that's right.
See, it is a watch.

24:53.170 --> 24:54.500
- Yes.
- Yes, it is.

24:54.500 --> 24:56.730
- Thank you.
I do--

24:56.730 --> 25:00.069
- Is there something special
about the watch?

25:00.069 --> 25:01.430
Yes or no.
Don't tell me anything.

25:01.430 --> 25:02.430
Is it something special?

25:02.430 --> 25:03.670
- Yes.
- Yes.

25:03.670 --> 25:06.200
- It's in your heart.
It's in your mind.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.329
It's all about the person who
this connects you with.

25:08.329 --> 25:09.500
I get family.

25:09.500 --> 25:12.569
I get a mother/son connection
in this moment.

25:12.569 --> 25:14.500
Is this from your mother?
- Yes.

25:14.500 --> 25:15.529
- It is?
- Wonderful.

25:15.529 --> 25:18.529
Fantastic.
Is your mother's...

25:20.200 --> 25:22.099
Can this be right?

25:22.099 --> 25:24.329
Have you got--say this,
is your mother's name

25:24.329 --> 25:27.329
engraved in the watch,
on the watch, anywhere?

25:27.329 --> 25:29.700
Yes or no? Is it engraved?
- No.

25:29.700 --> 25:31.529
- How many people in this
room know your mother?

25:31.529 --> 25:32.930
- One.

25:32.930 --> 25:35.529
- Is there any way in the world
Tessa knows your mother?

25:35.529 --> 25:37.500
- Oh, no.
- No, totally impossible.

25:37.500 --> 25:39.000
Focus on your
mother's first name.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.500
I'm not gonna ask you.
I want you to focus.

25:40.500 --> 25:42.029
Send first thoughts
to Tessa.

25:42.029 --> 25:44.329
Name of this mother, Tess.

25:44.329 --> 25:46.099
- Cora.
- Is your mother's name Cora?

25:46.099 --> 25:47.069
- Yes.
- Fantastic!

25:47.069 --> 25:48.829
You got it.
Excellent, excellent, Tess.

25:48.829 --> 25:50.230
- Thank you for sharing that.
- Let's--

25:50.230 --> 25:52.529
- Thank you.

25:52.529 --> 25:54.430
- Go one step further.

25:54.430 --> 25:56.200
Could I ask you to help me out,
Penn and Teller?

25:56.200 --> 25:58.099
- Sure.
- Yes, do you have any money?

25:58.099 --> 25:59.430
- Money?
You want money?

25:59.430 --> 26:01.230
- We're gonna get something
really challenging.

26:01.230 --> 26:02.670
- Oh, this is wonderful.
- If you have a large bill.

26:02.670 --> 26:04.730
Like, the bigger the bill,
the better she gets.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.430
- That is so true, yes.

26:06.430 --> 26:09.569
- Just remember the value of
this bill that's in mind

26:09.569 --> 26:10.670
More, Tess?

26:10.670 --> 26:12.529
- I want you to think of
what it's worth.

26:12.529 --> 26:14.069
I know we asked you
for a large bill,

26:14.069 --> 26:16.500
but you did have the opportunity
to choose any value

26:16.500 --> 26:17.500
that you wanted.

26:17.500 --> 26:18.670
- That's correct.

26:18.670 --> 26:22.029
- But I believe that you
selected a $100 bill.

26:22.029 --> 26:23.599
- Yes.

26:23.599 --> 26:26.369
- Concentrate carefully.

26:26.369 --> 26:29.569
- I want to...

26:29.569 --> 26:31.700
concentrate with you

26:31.700 --> 26:33.000
on the bill.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.029
I am sensing numbers only.

26:35.029 --> 26:36.170
Forget the letters.

26:36.170 --> 26:39.000
I'm thinking there's a nine.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.599
Followed by an eight.
- Yes.

26:41.599 --> 26:43.200
- I'm thinking of--
- That's correct.

26:43.200 --> 26:44.430
- Thank you.
A two.

26:44.430 --> 26:46.569
- Yup.
- And then an eight.

26:46.569 --> 26:48.170
- Eight, yep.

26:48.170 --> 26:50.599
- It's a little hazy now, I want
to be sure if I get it right.

26:50.599 --> 26:52.670
First I thought
it was a two next.

26:52.670 --> 26:54.170
- Yep.
- And then a four.

26:54.170 --> 26:56.769
- Yep.
- And this is where I lose you.

26:56.769 --> 26:58.269
- Can you get what
the last two digits are?

26:58.269 --> 27:00.900
- Is it a three and a six?
- Yes, it is.

27:00.900 --> 27:03.900
- It really is exaclty--that's
it, she got the serial number.

27:03.900 --> 27:06.230
Ladies and gentlemen,
the amazing Tessa.

27:06.230 --> 27:08.029
- Thank you.

27:08.029 --> 27:10.400
It is so good to see
you all again in person.

27:10.400 --> 27:13.000
- Wow.
- It's been such a pleasure.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.529
Oh.
- Aw.

27:14.529 --> 27:17.569
- That's why I do it, Teller,
you read my mind.

27:17.569 --> 27:20.400
Thank you.
- The Evasons!

27:20.400 --> 27:22.230
- Thank you very much,
everybody.

27:22.230 --> 27:25.329
- Thank you.
- That is incredible!

27:25.329 --> 27:26.700
Whoa!

27:26.700 --> 27:28.700
- Can you imagine what it would
be like to be married

27:28.700 --> 27:29.700
to a woman like this?

27:29.700 --> 27:31.069
- Oh, my goodness.

27:31.069 --> 27:35.400
Well, you clearly let her
do all the decision making.

27:35.400 --> 27:37.099
- Absolutely.
- Yes.

27:37.099 --> 27:39.099
I mean,
do you ever talk?

27:39.099 --> 27:41.170
- There's no need to, really.
- No.

27:41.170 --> 27:43.599
You must have the
perfect relationship.

27:43.599 --> 27:46.430
- Uh, it's pretty good, we've
been together for 33 years.

27:46.430 --> 27:48.099
- 34.
- Oh, 34.

27:48.099 --> 27:50.099
- Oh, jeez.

27:50.099 --> 27:52.000
Maybe you need to
teach him a little bit.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.200
- I will,
just a little bit.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.200
But it's a powerful thing
to have, right?

27:55.200 --> 27:56.529
- Absolutely.

27:56.529 --> 27:59.869
So I'm sure you've never fought
a day in your life, right?

27:59.869 --> 28:02.069
Because you always know
what he's thinking.

28:02.069 --> 28:04.230
- But I even know what
he's thinking right now.

28:04.230 --> 28:06.200
It's easy.
Buffet.

28:06.200 --> 28:07.500
- Right.
[laughter]

28:07.500 --> 28:09.930
- All right, well,
let's go to the boys.

28:09.930 --> 28:12.230
Penn, Teller,
what do you think?

28:12.230 --> 28:14.329
[both clapping]

28:14.329 --> 28:17.329
- That's what we think.
- Thank you.

28:17.329 --> 28:20.369
- You know,
in this day and age

28:20.369 --> 28:22.599
of electronic communication,

28:22.599 --> 28:27.900
in this day and age of earpieces
and iPads and iPhones,

28:27.900 --> 28:31.069
uh, seeing someone that does it
in the old style

28:31.069 --> 28:34.569
and seeing how much better that
is than the new style,

28:34.569 --> 28:35.829
it's just breathtaking.

28:35.829 --> 28:39.670
Teller and I have been working
together for 40 years.

28:39.670 --> 28:43.500
Those first few years,
we traveled everywhere together.

28:43.500 --> 28:45.730
We were driving
in the car together.

28:45.730 --> 28:47.670
Datsun station wagon.

28:47.670 --> 28:51.900
We decided to learn
an act something like this.

28:51.900 --> 28:54.769
And we worked and studied

28:54.769 --> 28:56.869
and practiced, and practiced,

28:56.869 --> 28:59.000
and practiced,
and it was years.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.869
And we got good enough
to do a deck of cards.

29:02.869 --> 29:06.769
They have opened this up
to seemingly everything

29:06.769 --> 29:08.500
in the world.

29:08.500 --> 29:11.170
We worked our
asses off for years,

29:11.170 --> 29:14.029
and didn't get one thousandth
where they are.

29:14.029 --> 29:17.170
The kind of mental gymnastics
that are done on this

29:17.170 --> 29:19.670
are unbelievable.

29:19.670 --> 29:22.329
This is one of those
rare acts where

29:22.329 --> 29:24.099
the more you know about it,

29:24.099 --> 29:25.829
the more amazing it is.

29:25.829 --> 29:27.500
Having said that,

29:27.500 --> 29:29.170
I'm not gonna say
any more about it.

29:29.170 --> 29:33.000
Because this act is so good,
I already feel like

29:33.000 --> 29:34.400
I may have said too much.

29:34.400 --> 29:37.170
I want them
to be working forever

29:37.170 --> 29:38.869
and doing this act everywhere.

29:38.869 --> 29:41.099
You know,
sometimes when I'm talking,

29:41.099 --> 29:44.569
I talk in code to magicians
and try to get people

29:44.569 --> 29:46.900
to be able to Google stuff
and to be able to

29:46.900 --> 29:50.099
figure out how it was done
and figure it out.

29:50.099 --> 29:51.900
I don't want to
give you any of that.

29:51.900 --> 29:55.099
I want you to just read my mind.
- [laughs]

29:55.099 --> 29:56.230
- All right.
- Yes.

29:56.230 --> 29:58.569
- But you know that we know.
- Absolutely.

29:58.569 --> 29:59.569
- And we know all.

29:59.569 --> 30:01.200
I don't think I can say this

30:01.200 --> 30:04.029
without any fear
of contradiction,

30:04.029 --> 30:07.569
I have never seen better
at what you're doing.

30:07.569 --> 30:09.230
And it is just fabulous.
- Thank you.

30:09.230 --> 30:11.099
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

30:11.099 --> 30:12.500
- Thank you.
- Okay.

30:12.500 --> 30:17.170
All right, so are convinced
that you didn't fool them?

30:17.170 --> 30:18.269
- Absolutely.

30:18.269 --> 30:21.569
- But you clearly are
phenomenal at what you do.

30:21.569 --> 30:23.730
So thank you
for entertaining us.

30:23.730 --> 30:25.430
Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

30:25.430 --> 30:27.670
- Ladies and gentlemen,
the Evasons!

30:27.670 --> 30:29.500
Thank you!
- Thank you, Penn and Teller.

30:29.500 --> 30:31.029
Thanks a lot.
- Thanks for the 100.

30:31.029 --> 30:33.029
- [laughs]

30:33.029 --> 30:35.829
[cheers and applause]

30:35.829 --> 30:39.599
I'm glad I'm not the judge here,
because everyone is fooling me.

30:39.599 --> 30:42.029
When we come back,
more mind-blowing magic.

30:42.029 --> 30:44.099
Stay close.

30:44.099 --> 30:47.099
[jazz music]

30:47.099 --> 30:49.099
â™ª â™ª

30:53.670 --> 30:56.170
[jazz music]

30:56.170 --> 30:58.069
[cheers and applause]

30:58.069 --> 31:00.799
- Welcome back to "Fool Us,"
where performers

31:00.799 --> 31:04.029
try to hit a grand slam
by throwing a curve ball

31:04.029 --> 31:05.569
by Penn and Teller.

31:05.569 --> 31:07.900
Come on,
baseball season, folks.

31:07.900 --> 31:09.099
You know?

31:09.099 --> 31:11.869
All right, let's meet
the next magician on deck.

31:11.869 --> 31:13.869
[explosion]

31:13.869 --> 31:16.400
- My name is Chef Anton,
and I am a professional

31:16.400 --> 31:18.200
trick shot artist
and magician.

31:18.200 --> 31:19.569
â™ª â™ª

31:19.569 --> 31:21.730
The first experience
I had with a pool table,

31:21.730 --> 31:23.369
I saw these colorful balls
rolling around,

31:23.369 --> 31:25.170
they disappeared into a pocket.

31:25.170 --> 31:27.170
I went to the pocket to get it,
and the ball was gone.

31:27.170 --> 31:30.000
It was complete magic to me.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.829
I was highly influenced
by my grandmother,

31:31.829 --> 31:33.500
and she was an amazing
pool hustler.

31:33.500 --> 31:35.069
By the time I was nine,
I was such an expert,

31:35.069 --> 31:37.029
I couldn't even get
an honest game anymore.

31:37.029 --> 31:38.900
It was after that
that I decided I wanted to

31:38.900 --> 31:42.599
blend comedy, magic,
and pool ball wizardry.

31:42.599 --> 31:45.769
I want people to understand
why I love hustling.

31:45.769 --> 31:48.269
If I can share that experience
that I love with them,

31:48.269 --> 31:49.599
done my job.

31:49.599 --> 31:51.029
[cheers and applause]

31:51.029 --> 31:53.400
- Please welcome Chef Anton.

31:53.400 --> 31:55.029
[cheers and applause]

31:55.029 --> 31:57.069
- Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight, I am going to share

31:57.069 --> 32:00.299
with you some of the greatest
pool hustles ever created.

32:00.299 --> 32:02.269
Once you learn the secret to it,
you'll never again

32:02.269 --> 32:06.029
pay for a drink or lunch
or a really nice gold watch.

32:06.029 --> 32:08.200
Um, first I would like to
make sure that

32:08.200 --> 32:09.329
the pool table is level.

32:09.329 --> 32:10.900
There's one way as a
professional

32:10.900 --> 32:14.230
that we would check that.

32:14.230 --> 32:16.099
Yeah, that's pretty good.

32:16.099 --> 32:19.930
Alyson, if you don't mind
joining me right on over here.

32:19.930 --> 32:23.029
Now, Alyson, if I were to bet
you that I could shoot

32:23.029 --> 32:25.700
an entire game of pool using
nothing more than, let's say,

32:25.700 --> 32:27.829
a little piece of thread
from my shirt,

32:27.829 --> 32:30.069
would you be willing
to bet against me?

32:30.069 --> 32:32.069
I mean, it seems like that'd be
a good bet, wouldn't it?

32:32.069 --> 32:33.230
- Yes.
- It's not a good bet.

32:33.230 --> 32:34.829
- Ohh.
- No, you should never bet

32:34.829 --> 32:36.099
against somebody like me,

32:36.099 --> 32:37.730
'cause while it would be
impossibly to shoot

32:37.730 --> 32:39.000
using just a piece of thread,

32:39.000 --> 32:42.400
it's not if I change it into a
$1,500 pool cue, instead.

32:42.400 --> 32:43.599
- Wow.

32:43.599 --> 32:46.430
- So let that be a little bit
of a lesson for you.

32:46.430 --> 32:48.200
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
I got to admit

32:48.200 --> 32:50.170
is that I love hustling.

32:50.170 --> 32:52.529
I've been shooting pool
since I was a little kid

32:52.529 --> 32:55.099
and I started hustling when
I was about nine years old.

32:55.099 --> 32:57.170
But the greatest hustle
that I ever pulled off

32:57.170 --> 32:59.700
in my entire life was the day
that I actually hustled

32:59.700 --> 33:01.130
Minnesota Fats.

33:01.130 --> 33:03.170
You guys have all heard of
Minnesota Fats before, right?

33:03.170 --> 33:06.230
One of the greatest pool
hustlers that ever lived.

33:06.230 --> 33:07.599
I met him at a pool hall.

33:07.599 --> 33:10.230
He was playing poker with a deck
of billiard playing cards.

33:10.230 --> 33:12.099
Have you ever seen
billiard playing cards?

33:12.099 --> 33:13.000
- No.
- They're really cool.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.700
They look like this.

33:14.700 --> 33:17.029
Well, that's half of them,
the other half looks like that.

33:17.029 --> 33:19.930
See, it screws together
kind of like a pool cue,

33:19.930 --> 33:21.369
which is--
it's actually really cool.

33:21.369 --> 33:23.029
The only downfall...

33:23.029 --> 33:24.430
[chuckles]
 Oops.

33:24.430 --> 33:27.099
The only downfall
to them is the, um...

33:27.099 --> 33:28.599
[chuckles]

33:28.599 --> 33:31.000
You got to remember to tighten
them, that's very important.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.569
But yeah, see,
when they're tightened up,

33:32.569 --> 33:34.500
you don't even see the seams,
which is kind of nice.

33:34.500 --> 33:36.329
You could even look
for yourself.

33:36.329 --> 33:39.269
All right, now what I would
like you to do, Alyson,

33:39.269 --> 33:40.900
is to simply push out any one

33:40.900 --> 33:41.900
of the cards in the deck.

33:41.900 --> 33:43.400
Just push one of those
out for me.

33:43.400 --> 33:45.029
That's fantastic.

33:45.029 --> 33:47.170
Go ahead and show your card
to everybody in the audience.

33:47.170 --> 33:48.569
I'll turn my back
so I don't see it.

33:48.569 --> 33:50.430
Make sure everybody gets
a good look at the card.

33:50.430 --> 33:51.569
- Okay.
- Show it all around.

33:51.569 --> 33:52.599
That's good.

33:52.599 --> 33:55.730
Back over that way,
that's fantastic.

33:55.730 --> 33:57.329
Now, believe it or not,

33:57.329 --> 34:00.470
Minnesota Fats actually thought
that I might be cheating.

34:00.470 --> 34:01.670
What're the chances?

34:01.670 --> 34:03.930
No, he thought that maybe
the deck was marked.

34:03.930 --> 34:06.269
And you can see that
there's no marks on this deck.

34:06.269 --> 34:08.030
On the front
or on the back, right?

34:08.030 --> 34:09.699
Including the card
that you have.

34:09.699 --> 34:11.400
There's no marks on
the front of the card.

34:11.400 --> 34:13.099
There's no marks on
the back of the card.

34:13.099 --> 34:15.530
There's no way that I could
possibly know what that card is.

34:15.530 --> 34:16.929
[laughter]

34:16.929 --> 34:19.170
Now, what I would like you to do
is to sign your name for me

34:19.170 --> 34:20.730
on one of those dots.

34:20.730 --> 34:22.000
Oh, I'm sorry,
let's get a pen.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.030
Here you go.

34:23.030 --> 34:24.429
Sign your name for me
on one of the dots.

34:24.429 --> 34:25.900
That'd be fantastic.
- Okay.

34:25.900 --> 34:28.329
Just like you'd sign a card
that's destined for EBay.

34:28.329 --> 34:30.000
- Okay.
- Fantastic.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.929
Please let me get that for ya.

34:31.929 --> 34:33.030
You look like you're busy.

34:33.030 --> 34:35.070
All right, so what we're gonna
do is, we're gonna

34:35.070 --> 34:36.869
take the sticker,
place it onto the face side,

34:36.869 --> 34:38.199
the picture side
of your card,

34:38.199 --> 34:40.329
and give you the only queen
of diamonds in the world

34:40.329 --> 34:42.099
that has your name
written on it, right?

34:42.099 --> 34:43.500
- Yes.
- All right.

34:43.500 --> 34:45.829
Now--oh, before I forget,
we need a couple of pool balls.

34:45.829 --> 34:47.070
Do you have a couple
of pool balls down there?

34:47.070 --> 34:48.929
Like in the side pocket?
Anywhere, it doesn't matter.

34:48.929 --> 34:50.829
Any two pool balls will do.

34:50.829 --> 34:52.500
That's fantastic.
Very good.

34:52.500 --> 34:54.329
One more great
billiard bar bet for you,

34:54.329 --> 34:57.329
take two pool balls
just like so.

35:01.070 --> 35:02.769
Learn how to do that,
you'll never pay for

35:02.769 --> 35:04.199
a drink again for
the rest of your life.

35:04.199 --> 35:05.199
[applause]

35:05.199 --> 35:07.070
Thank you.

35:07.070 --> 35:08.329
All right.

35:08.329 --> 35:10.199
Now, let's recap
what's happened here.

35:10.199 --> 35:14.030
Alyson, you had a free choice
of 52 cards in the deck,

35:14.030 --> 35:17.099
including three cards
that were faceup on the table

35:17.099 --> 35:18.000
that you could've
selected, right?

35:18.000 --> 35:19.030
- Yes.
- You wrote your name

35:19.030 --> 35:20.769
on one of
these gigantic stickers

35:20.769 --> 35:22.730
in your handwriting,
and we've placed it onto

35:22.730 --> 35:25.269
the face side,
the picture side of your card.

35:25.269 --> 35:26.929
I forgot what
your card was now.

35:26.929 --> 35:28.000
Your card, that's right,
queen of diamonds

35:28.000 --> 35:30.670
has your name written on it
in your handwriting

35:30.670 --> 35:32.099
going all the way
into the deck.

35:32.099 --> 35:33.199
Yes?
- Yes.

35:33.199 --> 35:35.000
- The proposition bet
for Minnesota Fats

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
was using nothing more
than those two pool balls,

35:37.000 --> 35:39.030
precariously balanced,
one on top of another

35:39.030 --> 35:41.400
and a little bit of magic,
that I would be able to find

35:41.400 --> 35:44.329
your card with your name written
on it in your handwriting

35:44.329 --> 35:46.329
out of this deck of cards.

35:46.329 --> 35:49.000
Now, that would actually be
a good bet, right?

35:49.000 --> 35:50.199
- Yes.
- No, it's not.

35:50.199 --> 35:52.199
If you don't mind giving me,
like, a little take one,

35:52.199 --> 35:53.829
this one doesn't always work.

35:53.829 --> 35:55.199
Could be here for a while.

35:55.199 --> 35:56.230
There you go.

35:56.230 --> 35:58.070
Ladies and gentlemen,
I now present to you

35:58.070 --> 36:00.170
the same shot that fooled
Minnesota Fats

36:00.170 --> 36:01.699
when I was just
nine years old.

36:01.699 --> 36:03.500
Trying to find
Alyson's card in the most

36:03.500 --> 36:06.099
unusual manner possible.

36:06.099 --> 36:07.429
Watch.

36:07.429 --> 36:09.929
There it go, it needs a little
more speed, a little more speed,

36:09.929 --> 36:12.170
a little more speed--that's
good, that's good, that's good.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.699
Hit the hat, that's good.
- Whoo!

36:14.699 --> 36:15.769
[audience exclaims]

36:15.769 --> 36:17.500
- Wait, we actually got one.

36:17.500 --> 36:19.099
Would you take that off?
- Oh, my goodness.

36:19.099 --> 36:20.769
- Does that have your name
written on it?

36:20.769 --> 36:22.199
In your handwriting--
is that the one?

36:22.199 --> 36:24.099
- Yes!
- Ladies and gentlemen.

36:24.099 --> 36:28.400
The same shot that fooled
Minnesota Fats.

36:28.400 --> 36:30.670
- Oh, my goodness.

36:30.670 --> 36:33.230
[cheers and applause]

36:33.230 --> 36:34.769
That was incredible.

36:34.769 --> 36:36.530
Tell me how
you got your name.

36:36.530 --> 36:38.099
- Oh, Chef Anton.
- Yes.

36:38.099 --> 36:39.929
- Actually, "chef"
is an acronym.

36:39.929 --> 36:43.170
And it stands for
Conmen Hustle Everyone Forever.

36:43.170 --> 36:45.070
Kind of always reminds me
of what I do out here.

36:45.070 --> 36:47.030
- I was--yes.

36:47.030 --> 36:49.030
Okay, 'cause I was
expecting a meal.

36:49.030 --> 36:50.269
- Oh, yeah, no, sorry,
I don't cook.

36:50.269 --> 36:51.829
- All right.

36:51.829 --> 36:54.570
Um, and you started playing pool
when you were four years old?

36:54.570 --> 36:56.530
- I started--yeah,
when I was four years old.

36:56.530 --> 36:58.829
Basically, I wasted the first
three years of my life.

36:58.829 --> 37:00.269
- [chuckles]
Yes.

37:00.269 --> 37:01.429
- Just kind of drifting.
- Yeah.

37:01.429 --> 37:03.929
So, I mean, by nine,
you were, like,

37:03.929 --> 37:05.369
a true hustler.

37:05.369 --> 37:08.900
- Yeah, yeah, my grandmother
was, like, a pool hustler

37:08.900 --> 37:11.030
in her day, back around
the days of the Depression.

37:11.030 --> 37:13.000
And that's when it wasn't such a
litigious society.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.400
So you could get away with this
and, like, not got get shot.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.670
[laughs]

37:16.670 --> 37:18.329
- And you were
making money at nine?

37:18.329 --> 37:20.199
- Yeah, I was making money
at nine years old.

37:20.199 --> 37:21.400
Yeah, it's what
I've been doing.

37:21.400 --> 37:23.170
- Do you think that
maybe you fooled them?

37:23.170 --> 37:25.099
- Oh, man, I would never say
that on national television.

37:25.099 --> 37:26.230
- No, it's true.
- Yeah, no.

37:26.230 --> 37:27.599
Boys?

37:27.599 --> 37:29.170
Um, boys, hi.
- Okay.

37:29.170 --> 37:32.900
- Now, we're--if you don't talk
to us, we're gonna play pool.

37:32.900 --> 37:35.900
And I'm gonna lose
some money, so...

37:35.900 --> 37:37.329
- Lots of good juggling,
you know?

37:37.329 --> 37:39.070
I mean, there's a lot of
juggling in there

37:39.070 --> 37:41.329
that I really liked.
There's a great thing here.

37:41.329 --> 37:45.170
The appearing cue was
an appearing cane.

37:45.170 --> 37:47.530
and you did a lot of the
putting--you actually

37:47.530 --> 37:50.070
confused us, we had to argue
about it a little bit.

37:50.070 --> 37:52.329
Because of a thing
called a card sword.

37:52.329 --> 37:55.000
And the card sword
is an elaborate gimmick...

37:55.000 --> 37:57.030
- Yes.
- That makes a card

37:57.030 --> 37:59.030
pop out onto a sword.
- It does.

37:59.030 --> 38:02.099
- We're trying to figure out
how you built

38:02.099 --> 38:05.199
a card sword in to a card cue,
and you didn't!

38:05.199 --> 38:07.570
You didn't, ya rat bastard.
- That's true.

38:07.570 --> 38:09.099
- You just did it
with slight of hand.

38:09.099 --> 38:11.199
You brute forced it on there.

38:11.199 --> 38:14.030
And as far as the
card trick is concerned,

38:14.030 --> 38:16.730
I want to change
a little bit to stealing.

38:16.730 --> 38:18.269
Now, you do bar bets.

38:18.269 --> 38:21.829
You ever do--ever just steal
something, like in a store?

38:21.829 --> 38:24.000
'Cause sometimes that's called
"lifting" something

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
in a store, you know?

38:25.000 --> 38:28.070
And sometimes you can go in
and steal with one hand,

38:28.070 --> 38:29.769
sometimes you can steal
with the other hand,

38:29.769 --> 38:31.230
sometimes you can steal
with both hands

38:31.230 --> 38:34.099
and have a double lift
at the same time.

38:34.099 --> 38:35.900
Have you ever done
that kind of stealing?

38:35.900 --> 38:39.000
- I've probably done that kind
of pick pocketing.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.070
- Yeah, that's the real hardcore
criminal stuff, isn't it?

38:42.070 --> 38:45.329
- So are you convinced they know
everything that you did?

38:45.329 --> 38:49.099
- I think they're definitely
on to something here.

38:49.099 --> 38:50.199
- You're convinced.

38:50.199 --> 38:53.429
- But we will still never,
ever take a bet with you.

38:53.429 --> 38:56.699
- That's a very wise decision.
- Well, so you didn't fool them.

38:56.699 --> 38:58.769
But you certainly
entertained us all.

38:58.769 --> 39:01.099
Thank you so much.

39:01.099 --> 39:03.429
Chef Anton!
- Thank you so much.

39:03.429 --> 39:04.829
Learned a very
valuable lesson.

39:04.829 --> 39:05.829
- Thank you.

39:05.829 --> 39:07.869
[applause]

39:07.869 --> 39:10.329
- We've seen the last of our
foolers for the night,

39:10.329 --> 39:13.599
that means it's time for
the masters, Penn and Teller.

39:13.599 --> 39:16.000
See them perform
when we come back.

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
[jazz music]

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
â™ª â™ª

39:25.829 --> 39:29.400
[jazz music]

39:29.400 --> 39:32.400
[alarm beeps]

39:34.269 --> 39:37.000
- Penn and Teller have been
watching along with us so far,

39:37.000 --> 39:39.170
but now it's time
for them to perform

39:39.170 --> 39:40.900
one of their famous tricks.

39:40.900 --> 39:44.030
Ladies and gentlemen,
Penn and Teller!

39:44.030 --> 39:47.400
[cheers and applause]

39:47.400 --> 39:49.400
- Thank you, Alyson.
Thanks so much.

39:49.400 --> 39:51.170
Thank you.
- Yes.

39:51.170 --> 39:53.400
[applause]

39:53.400 --> 39:56.099
- You know, sadly, we've all
gotten pretty used to these.

39:56.099 --> 39:59.070
As a matter of fact, the network
insists everybody that comes in

39:59.070 --> 40:01.429
goes through the metal detector,
so had to, you know,

40:01.429 --> 40:03.730
take off our coats,
get used to the drill.

40:03.730 --> 40:07.570
But the way these things work
is called "pulse induction."

40:07.570 --> 40:11.170
Sends out thousands of magnetic
impulses every second.

40:11.170 --> 40:13.670
One of those hit a piece of
metal, it sets off the alarm.

40:13.670 --> 40:15.900
This is the handheld version.

40:15.900 --> 40:17.269
It's also a pulse induction.

40:17.269 --> 40:19.000
We're also used to these.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.829
But the interest--
I want to show you this.

40:20.829 --> 40:24.369
The interesting thing is,
watch this.

40:24.369 --> 40:25.530
[machines beeping]

40:25.530 --> 40:26.699
See?

40:26.699 --> 40:28.769
They even hate each other.

40:28.769 --> 40:30.000
[laughter]

40:30.000 --> 40:32.030
The problem with metal detectors
is exactly same

40:32.030 --> 40:33.369
as the problem with locks.

40:33.369 --> 40:36.070
They only work
on good people.

40:36.070 --> 40:38.070
Bad people sneak on anything.

40:38.070 --> 40:39.670
Let me have the, uh...

40:39.670 --> 40:42.199
that's where Teller
has his, uh,

40:42.199 --> 40:45.199
Mysto-Deluxe firepot
right there.

40:45.199 --> 40:47.429
Teller's concerned about
safety, so he also has

40:47.429 --> 40:50.000
a fire extinguisher with him.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
[extinguisher hissing]

40:52.000 --> 40:53.869
And in case that's not enough,
Teller also has

40:53.869 --> 40:55.869
a full-sized shovel.

40:55.869 --> 40:59.170
Thinking in terms
of that fire triangle.

40:59.170 --> 41:02.000
Now, these are
the lists of the rules

41:02.000 --> 41:04.400
that the network has
right here of things

41:04.400 --> 41:05.570
they won't allow in here.

41:05.570 --> 41:06.570
You all know this.

41:06.570 --> 41:09.199
Obviously,
they do not allow guns,

41:09.199 --> 41:11.699
but there's also
no snow globes allowed.

41:11.699 --> 41:13.099
And nothing over there is
allowed.

41:13.099 --> 41:16.030
No fire extinguishers,
and no non-ticketed

41:16.030 --> 41:19.570
showgirls carrying bazookas.

41:19.570 --> 41:22.070
That's Georgie Bernasek
right there.

41:22.070 --> 41:23.869
Georgie Bernasek!

41:23.869 --> 41:26.030
[cheers and applause]

41:26.030 --> 41:28.730
- My kids are
definitely gonna ask

41:28.730 --> 41:30.269
how tonight's
tricks were done.

41:30.269 --> 41:32.929
And I still won't
have the answers.

41:32.929 --> 41:35.199
What a great night.
Thanks for watching.

41:35.199 --> 41:36.369
See ya soon!

41:36.369 --> 41:39.369
[jazz music]

41:39.369 --> 41:47.369
