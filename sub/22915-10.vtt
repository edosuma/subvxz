WEBVTT

00:01.517 --> 00:03.718
Previously on "Shut Eye"...

00:03.719 --> 00:05.199
I have this bad habit

00:05.200 --> 00:07.882
of fucking up the good
things in my life.

00:07.883 --> 00:09.363
And you've been good to me.

00:09.364 --> 00:14.328
So, of course,
I'm going to try to fuck it up.

00:14.329 --> 00:16.490
Police! Get on the ground!

00:16.491 --> 00:18.013
It's okay, Charlie.

00:20.776 --> 00:24.859
Linda would say that
you're feeding my delusion.

00:24.860 --> 00:27.061
I'm feeding your curiosity,

00:27.062 --> 00:29.624
which is something you cannot
have enough of in this business.

00:29.625 --> 00:33.387
Fonso Marks of the Gypsies.

00:33.388 --> 00:35.978
And you fuck with Gypsies,

00:37.352 --> 00:39.398
Gypsies fuck you.

00:40.716 --> 00:42.116
All right.

00:42.117 --> 00:44.559
I asked a question, I got an answer.

00:44.560 --> 00:46.200
No hard feelings, right?

00:46.201 --> 00:48.563
We are on the precipice
of something here.

00:48.564 --> 00:50.685
I know you can feel that.

00:50.686 --> 00:53.078
You don't think I have someone?

00:54.089 --> 00:56.571
It's fucking hard, but I bury it.

00:56.572 --> 00:58.452
I put it to one side
for the sake of the work,

00:58.453 --> 01:01.255
for the sake of what
we are trying to achieve.

01:01.256 --> 01:04.218
Go home to your family, Charlie.

01:04.218 --> 01:05.620
I got a feeling, Foster,

01:05.621 --> 01:07.862
that you and I are going
to be great friends.

01:07.863 --> 01:11.305
There are a lot of rules
involved in being my friend.

01:11.306 --> 01:14.228
And it usually requires
making a few new enemies.

01:14.229 --> 01:15.750
The most important part of the con

01:15.751 --> 01:19.113
is actually identifying the right mark,
right,

01:19.114 --> 01:21.064
someone ready to be taken.

01:21.837 --> 01:24.799
Charlie, please, take over the retreat.

01:24.800 --> 01:27.321
They need help as much as I do.

01:27.322 --> 01:28.963
I can't.

01:28.964 --> 01:30.484
Maggie will be there.

01:30.485 --> 01:32.534
She'll talk you through it.

01:33.889 --> 01:35.770
Let's get you checked out.

01:35.771 --> 01:37.652
I think that's a good idea.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:40.075 --> 02:43.157
Charlie?

02:43.158 --> 02:46.521
Charlie, open the door.
I have a present for you.

02:46.522 --> 02:47.901
It's from your mom.

02:48.684 --> 02:50.685
My mom's in jail.

02:50.686 --> 02:52.767
You never heard of visiting hours?

02:52.768 --> 02:54.970
She wanted me to give it to you.
Come on. Open up.

02:57.853 --> 02:59.854
Open the door, Charlie.

03:08.463 --> 03:10.344
Oh, my God!

03:10.345 --> 03:13.027
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
What are you doing?

03:13.028 --> 03:14.108
What about her?

03:14.109 --> 03:15.550
We're not here for her.

03:15.551 --> 03:18.272
Oh, my God!
Aah!

03:42.217 --> 03:44.338
Syl.

03:44.339 --> 03:45.900
Wake up, get dressed.

03:45.901 --> 03:48.262
Leave me alone! I just want to sleep!

03:48.263 --> 03:50.064
It's visiting day. Come on, let's go.

03:50.065 --> 03:51.987
Ugh!

04:08.123 --> 04:09.924
Hey!

04:11.847 --> 04:13.768
Hi, guys! Sit down!

04:13.769 --> 04:17.250
Look! Oh, you guys are the best!

04:17.252 --> 04:19.093
I was just starting
to go in withdrawals.

04:20.736 --> 04:22.857
You smoked a whole carton?
It's only been a week.

04:22.858 --> 04:25.660
No, of course not.
I traded most of them for perks.

04:25.661 --> 04:28.102
You would be proud of Mom.
I'm getting to know the system.

04:30.105 --> 04:31.746
So, how's tricks, guys?

04:31.747 --> 04:33.548
You having big fun at Auntie's?

04:34.109 --> 04:35.842
Her house stinks.

04:36.431 --> 04:38.392
Oh, yeah?
She stinks.

04:38.393 --> 04:40.055
Shut up, Sylvia.

04:40.756 --> 04:42.276
What's eating you, kid?

04:42.277 --> 04:44.267
You mean other than you're in jail?

04:45.801 --> 04:46.978
Baby.

04:49.284 --> 04:51.125
I just couldn't sleep is all.

04:51.126 --> 04:53.207
Oh. You never could.

04:53.208 --> 04:55.690
Me, neither.

04:55.691 --> 04:57.531
He had a bad dream.

04:59.174 --> 05:00.494
Last night?

05:00.495 --> 05:04.218
He woke up screaming like a baby.

05:04.219 --> 05:07.543
Charlie, what'd you dream about?

05:13.749 --> 05:16.150
Uh, Syl, why don't you give your
brother and I a minute, huh?

05:16.151 --> 05:18.513
Okay? Manny, can you help my daughter?

05:18.514 --> 05:20.034
Thanks.

05:20.035 --> 05:22.718
Okay, baby.
Mnh-mnh.

05:30.606 --> 05:32.107
Bye!

05:34.810 --> 05:36.330
All right.

05:36.331 --> 05:37.529
Tell me what's going on.

05:39.374 --> 05:40.816
It was just a dream.

05:49.985 --> 05:53.295
The woman,
the one that you did deals with,

05:54.029 --> 05:57.215
she came to the house,

05:58.994 --> 06:01.076
but she wasn't alone.

06:03.438 --> 06:05.015
Did they have guns?

06:06.602 --> 06:08.604
And, uh, someone got hurt?

06:11.406 --> 06:14.128
Do you know who Jeane Dixon is?

06:14.129 --> 06:16.531
The White House Psychic?

06:16.532 --> 06:18.132
I hear the First Lady, she won't even...

06:18.133 --> 06:21.375
she won't even make a move
without consulting her.

06:21.376 --> 06:23.377
And I read her book a while back,

06:23.378 --> 06:24.739
and she talks about these sort of dreams

06:24.740 --> 06:27.221
she has that come true.

06:27.222 --> 06:31.065
Like, she saw Kennedy get shot
long before it ever happened.

06:31.066 --> 06:32.667
They're called premonitions.

06:32.668 --> 06:34.148
Yes! Right! Okay, yes.

06:34.149 --> 06:37.756
So, what if your dream is one of those?

06:38.514 --> 06:40.234
You said psychics aren't real.

06:40.235 --> 06:42.093
Yeah, I know, I know. But...

06:44.199 --> 06:47.723
I had the same dream last night.

06:51.086 --> 06:52.020
Charlie...

06:53.128 --> 06:54.356
they shot her.

06:55.450 --> 06:57.452
They shot your auntie, right?

07:02.778 --> 07:05.033
Oh, my God. Um, okay.

07:06.502 --> 07:08.823
You need to get your sister,
and you need to get out of there.

07:08.824 --> 07:11.265
What are you talking about?
It's like JFK.

07:11.266 --> 07:12.987
Charlie, this is a warning.
They are coming for you.

07:12.988 --> 07:14.709
Listen to me. They are coming.
Come on, Haverford.

07:14.710 --> 07:16.190
It's not a dream.
Let's go.

07:16.191 --> 07:18.232
Charlie, listen to me.
Get your sister and run!

07:18.233 --> 07:20.154
Don't wait. Do you hear me?!

08:26.141 --> 08:29.223
You're late.
I, uh, took a little detour

08:29.224 --> 08:30.994
through the Twilight Zone.

08:31.587 --> 08:34.388
You're not lying to me,
but you're not telling me the truth.

08:34.389 --> 08:35.624
Oh.

08:36.111 --> 08:37.871
You think you can read me that well?

08:37.873 --> 08:40.462
Better every day.

08:41.957 --> 08:44.559
Something happened to you,
hence the sour demeanor.

08:44.560 --> 08:46.881
No, I'm just worried about Paz.

08:46.882 --> 08:48.723
Now you're lying.

08:48.724 --> 08:50.044
Why aren't you?

08:50.045 --> 08:52.223
Aren't I what?
Worried about Paz.

08:52.688 --> 08:54.208
Not so much since I spoke to him.

08:54.209 --> 08:56.731
He seemed stable, calm.

08:56.732 --> 08:58.372
I think they gave him meds.

08:58.373 --> 08:59.689
That'll do it.

09:01.016 --> 09:04.619
I wanted to thank you
for saving my ass this weekend.

09:04.620 --> 09:06.861
You do remember my ass, don't you?

09:06.862 --> 09:08.302
You seemed pretty preoccupied with it

09:08.303 --> 09:09.984
the other day.
Maggie, come on.

09:09.985 --> 09:13.328
Oh, I am only trying
to break you out of your funk.

09:14.412 --> 09:15.670
You're poised, Charlie.

09:15.671 --> 09:17.672
You're gonna do
great things this weekend.

09:17.673 --> 09:19.273
You're gonna help a lot of souls.

09:19.274 --> 09:20.755
Make a shit-load of money for you.

09:20.756 --> 09:22.116
Make us a shit-load of money.

09:22.117 --> 09:23.878
Right, "us."

09:23.879 --> 09:25.159
What's this?

09:25.160 --> 09:29.044
This is your home away from home.

09:33.208 --> 09:35.350
No Wi-Fi, no mini-bar?

09:36.612 --> 09:40.414
Well, Paz preferred a simple,
Gandhi-esque lifestyle

09:40.415 --> 09:42.256
while in the confines of the retreat.

09:42.257 --> 09:44.779
Gandhi was a big believer in celibacy.

09:44.780 --> 09:47.421
Yeah, no sex before seminars.

09:47.422 --> 09:49.104
Wise words.

09:52.187 --> 09:54.829
What is it, Charlie? Tell me.

09:54.830 --> 09:57.191
What is bothering you?

09:57.192 --> 09:59.034
It's here, isn't it?

10:00.676 --> 10:04.158
Where you helped Paz hear the universe?

10:04.159 --> 10:05.880
Indeed.

10:05.881 --> 10:09.363
It is the perfect
environment for hypnosis.

10:09.364 --> 10:11.966
Or manipulation.
Or therapy,

10:11.967 --> 10:14.055
depending on your point of view.

10:15.290 --> 10:17.225
What's your point of view, Maggie?

10:18.974 --> 10:20.770
You should try it.

10:22.057 --> 10:24.298
It's really rather soothing.

10:24.299 --> 10:25.525
No, thanks.

10:26.381 --> 10:27.652
I'll pass.

10:28.544 --> 10:31.547
Come on. Let me introduce you
to the rest of the team.

10:36.992 --> 10:41.796
Folks, this... is Charlie.

10:41.797 --> 10:43.501
Hello, folks.

10:44.319 --> 10:47.001
We have data collection, event staff,

10:47.002 --> 10:49.884
marketing, and security.

10:49.885 --> 10:52.446
And Elizabeth you've already met.

10:52.447 --> 10:54.008
Liz, please.

10:54.009 --> 10:55.805
Oh, right. Yeah.

10:57.092 --> 10:58.813
I've been tweaking
your schedule for Saturday.

10:58.814 --> 11:00.775
I'd like to go over it with you.
I need to make a call.

11:00.776 --> 11:03.137
Paz never used the phone on retreat.

11:03.138 --> 11:05.220
I'm not Paz.

11:08.183 --> 11:09.864
I don't

11:09.865 --> 11:11.265
You just accelerate with
the right-trigger. Right here.

11:11.266 --> 11:12.547
Right trigger. Okay, okay, okay.

11:12.548 --> 11:14.188
Hold that one.
Yeah. Oh, my God!

11:14.189 --> 11:16.070
There's a turn. There's a turn.
There's a left turn.

11:16.071 --> 11:17.712
I don't understand!
Can you turn?

11:17.713 --> 11:19.714
Oh, my God. Shift up, okay.

11:19.715 --> 11:21.516
All right. Um, B!

11:21.517 --> 11:24.799
B! B! Press B!
I'm doing B! Wait, wait.

11:24.800 --> 11:26.761
This is shit.

11:26.762 --> 11:29.163
Hi, honey.
Hey. How you doing?

11:29.164 --> 11:31.165
I'm good. Still good.

11:31.166 --> 11:32.847
Yeah, I don't mean to bother you,

11:32.848 --> 11:34.448
I just wanted to make sure
you're all right.

11:34.449 --> 11:36.290
You're not a bother.
You just haven't called this much

11:36.291 --> 11:37.932
since I was pregnant.

11:37.933 --> 11:39.213
Trying to tell me something?

11:39.214 --> 11:41.455
Shut the fuck up.

11:41.456 --> 11:44.218
How's it going out there?
You full of peace and truth?

11:44.219 --> 11:46.314
I'm definitely full of something.

11:47.142 --> 11:50.785
It's just not my audience.
It's... It's not my style.

11:50.786 --> 11:52.987
Bullshit, you'll be great. Oh, shit!

11:52.988 --> 11:54.909
What? You... Are you all right?

11:54.910 --> 11:57.311
Yeah, yeah, just a kitchen crisis.

11:57.312 --> 11:58.432
I got to go.

11:58.433 --> 12:00.796
Okay, bye.

12:03.799 --> 12:05.600
Come on, one more.
I can't.

12:05.601 --> 12:07.361
One more.
You're too good. And I suck!

12:07.362 --> 12:08.723
Come on.
No.

12:08.724 --> 12:11.125
We can be on the same side.
Unh-unh.

12:15.891 --> 12:17.772
So, uh, was that the hospital?

12:17.773 --> 12:19.453
No. Charlie.

12:19.454 --> 12:21.856
Checking in for the umpteenth time.

12:21.857 --> 12:24.939
Oh, well, that's nice.
And controlling.

12:24.940 --> 12:28.182
Since he left, he's been calling
every hour on the hour.

12:28.183 --> 12:29.774
I know how he feels.

12:31.306 --> 12:34.909
Paz is in a great place.
He's getting the care he needs.

12:34.910 --> 12:35.947
Yeah, I know.

12:37.593 --> 12:39.794
I guess it's... It's just that...

12:42.437 --> 12:45.000
Honestly,
I'm a little more worried about me.

12:50.085 --> 12:51.254
I mean...

12:52.888 --> 12:56.676
what if Paz never hears again?

12:58.253 --> 13:00.895
He was my... my conduit,

13:00.896 --> 13:02.348
my teacher.

13:03.539 --> 13:06.603
I mean,
Paz has been there for me forever.

13:11.266 --> 13:14.309
If he doesn't get better, I just...
I don't know.

13:15.791 --> 13:17.833
I don't...

13:19.635 --> 13:21.576
I don't know who will be there for me...

13:22.437 --> 13:23.953
and my baby.

13:24.960 --> 13:26.401
I will.

13:56.191 --> 13:58.432
Come on, partner. It's quitting time.

13:58.433 --> 14:00.675
Let's go get a michelada. My treat.

14:00.676 --> 14:03.437
I'd love to, but I suspect

14:03.438 --> 14:06.841
I'll be burning the midnight
oil this evening, so...

14:06.842 --> 14:09.290
Let's go. Come on.

14:10.085 --> 14:11.405
Something I can help you with?

14:11.406 --> 14:13.127
Nope. No.

14:14.209 --> 14:15.930
You sure?

14:15.931 --> 14:17.411
Yeah, yeah.

14:17.412 --> 14:19.050
It's, uh...

14:20.976 --> 14:22.216
family business.

14:22.217 --> 14:24.430
Ah, okay.

14:25.260 --> 14:26.501
But I'll take a rain check.

14:26.502 --> 14:27.850
You got it.

14:29.745 --> 14:31.065
Go home.

14:31.066 --> 14:32.707
Enjoy an evening with the family.

14:32.708 --> 14:33.773
All right.

14:35.110 --> 14:36.791
Vaya con Dios.

14:36.792 --> 14:38.272
What?

14:38.273 --> 14:40.405
I got to teach you Spanish.

15:11.426 --> 15:13.267
Jun-bi.

15:38.493 --> 15:40.381
This better be good.

15:43.939 --> 15:45.928
As good as this Cohiba?

15:47.022 --> 15:49.184
Nicely done.

15:53.228 --> 15:54.829
Now that I'm no longer marime,

15:54.830 --> 15:58.152
I had hoped to seek
the counsel of my Rom Baro

15:58.153 --> 15:59.674
for some sage advice.

15:59.675 --> 16:01.235
Yeah. Yeah, go ahead.

16:01.236 --> 16:03.558
Just make it snappy.

16:03.559 --> 16:06.324
Okay. Here's the thing.

16:06.802 --> 16:09.964
I have a t... had a tenant

16:09.965 --> 16:11.806
who stopped paying his rent.

16:11.807 --> 16:14.488
What happened to him?
I don't know.

16:14.489 --> 16:15.958
Disappeared.

16:16.612 --> 16:20.214
But according to the terms of his lease,

16:20.215 --> 16:23.177
I'm within my rights to confiscate

16:23.178 --> 16:26.219
whatever was left
behind on the property.

16:29.344 --> 16:31.182
What'd you find, Fonso?

16:31.987 --> 16:33.893
Wait till you see this.

16:44.199 --> 16:45.761
Close the door.

16:48.243 --> 16:51.886
Apparently, there's a buyer in place...

16:51.887 --> 16:55.129
a biker named Cordero. I got no idea...

16:55.130 --> 16:58.613
All right.
You're in over your fucking head here.

16:58.614 --> 16:59.934
I'll handle this.

16:59.935 --> 17:02.130
I'll throw your family a percentage.

17:03.298 --> 17:04.799
You're too kind.

17:05.380 --> 17:07.300
Doesn't mean you're not a piece of shit.

17:07.301 --> 17:08.904
I realize that.

17:35.731 --> 17:37.573
You got a light, Charlie?

17:43.779 --> 17:44.922
Mom.

17:46.061 --> 17:47.381
You smoke too much.

17:47.382 --> 17:48.759
Well, that's true.

17:49.264 --> 17:50.865
And you drink too much.

17:50.866 --> 17:51.986
According to you.

17:51.987 --> 17:54.308
And you snort way too much.

17:55.591 --> 17:57.713
People in glass houses shouldn't...

17:59.234 --> 18:01.516
walk around naked, you know,
or whatever the fuck it is.

18:01.517 --> 18:02.997
Can we just get on with it?

18:02.998 --> 18:05.693
'Cause I need to lead
a seminar in the A. M.

18:06.321 --> 18:10.204
You have a seminar? That's fancy.

18:10.205 --> 18:11.526
Can I just get a light, please?

18:11.527 --> 18:12.727
Mom!

18:14.369 --> 18:15.410
Oh.

18:20.896 --> 18:22.084
Nice.

18:22.738 --> 18:24.699
What the hell are you even doing here?

18:24.700 --> 18:26.861
What... You tell me.

18:26.862 --> 18:28.342
Is this about the Slydini knot?

18:28.343 --> 18:30.424
'Cause I've told you a thousand times...

18:30.425 --> 18:32.261
When you visited me in prison.

18:33.028 --> 18:35.750
When I visited you in prison...

18:35.751 --> 18:38.472
I didn't do it on purpose, Mom.

18:38.473 --> 18:41.796
Charlie, it doesn't matter.

18:41.797 --> 18:43.878
It was fate, meant to be.

18:43.879 --> 18:47.041
If you did it or not, it is what it is.

18:47.042 --> 18:48.442
I don't believe in fate.

18:48.443 --> 18:50.244
Well, you better fucking start.

18:50.245 --> 18:53.282
Why, because of my vision about my wife?

18:53.809 --> 18:57.251
Linda, right? She seems so nice.

18:57.252 --> 18:59.247
She's my kind of gal.

19:00.776 --> 19:02.496
I wish I'd met her.

19:02.497 --> 19:04.659
But, no, Charlie, this is not a vision.

19:04.660 --> 19:06.212
This is a premonition.

19:07.503 --> 19:09.184
Gotcha.

19:11.667 --> 19:12.987
How's that?

19:12.988 --> 19:15.149
Remember that premonition we shared?

19:15.150 --> 19:16.871
Like it was yesterday.

19:16.872 --> 19:18.633
Sylvia and I weren't kidnapped.

19:18.634 --> 19:20.184
Auntie wasn't killed.

19:21.156 --> 19:23.271
Hmm, mm, maybe that wasn't the point.

19:24.319 --> 19:25.680
Wait. What the fuck does that mean?

19:25.681 --> 19:27.882
Maybe it had something else in mind.

19:27.883 --> 19:29.964
What is "it"?
Fate, stupid.

19:29.965 --> 19:31.526
I told you, I don't believe in fate.

19:31.527 --> 19:33.529
Then what do you believe in, Charlie?

19:39.454 --> 19:40.663
Great question.

19:41.577 --> 19:43.916
Hmm. Well...

19:44.780 --> 19:47.181
you'd better find an answer
before your Goddamn seminar

19:47.182 --> 19:49.505
in the morning. Right?

19:52.588 --> 19:55.630
You want a bump?

19:55.631 --> 19:57.431
Not you.

19:57.432 --> 19:59.033
Jesus, Mom.

20:03.959 --> 20:06.440
Relax, kid. The question is not,

20:06.441 --> 20:08.563
"Is there a higher power?"

20:08.564 --> 20:10.805
The question is,

20:10.806 --> 20:13.279
"Why is the higher power
such an asshole?"

21:16.351 --> 21:19.313
Did Josip take the bait?

21:19.314 --> 21:24.078
Yeah, he took the bait.
Hook, line, and sinker.

21:24.079 --> 21:26.440
What would be the next step?

21:26.441 --> 21:28.764
We wait for my guy
to show up with the cash.

21:31.166 --> 21:32.967
What about your partner?

21:32.968 --> 21:34.690
Suspects nothing.

21:36.852 --> 21:39.654
I know, but what about them, you know?
The Rankos.

21:39.655 --> 21:41.776
Shh.

21:41.777 --> 21:44.078
I mean, if the Council dissolves.

21:45.821 --> 21:47.221
Well, we'll form a new one...

21:49.024 --> 21:50.751
with new leadership.

21:52.467 --> 21:54.505
With the Marks family on top.

21:55.310 --> 21:58.033
Jun-bi.

22:16.371 --> 22:18.533
Uh...

22:18.534 --> 22:21.135
I'm not Paz...

22:21.136 --> 22:23.738
obviously.

22:24.618 --> 22:27.341
Uh, I can't offer what he could,

22:27.342 --> 22:30.464
uh, but I've been around.
I've seen things.

22:30.465 --> 22:32.186
I've learned things.

22:32.187 --> 22:33.628
And I want you to give me a chance

22:33.629 --> 22:36.632
to share some of that with you.

22:40.716 --> 22:42.720
My approach is quite different.

22:43.719 --> 22:46.801
To some, it may even seem harsh.

22:46.802 --> 22:50.084
My intent is not to offend
but to challenge.

22:50.085 --> 22:52.446
Challenge you to look inward,

22:52.447 --> 22:56.811
to see what it is about you
that pushed you here today,

22:56.812 --> 22:58.569
to kick you in the ass.

22:59.174 --> 23:00.613
To help you...

23:01.657 --> 23:05.740
To help you, uh, stop being passengers

23:05.741 --> 23:08.102
in your own lives.

23:08.103 --> 23:10.105
Get you behind the wheel.

23:18.393 --> 23:21.634
Despite what some of you have
heard from others in my trade,

23:22.397 --> 23:24.239
there is no road map.

23:27.603 --> 23:30.284
There is no such thing as fate

23:30.285 --> 23:31.727
or destiny.

23:33.048 --> 23:35.690
Your path is not pre-determined.

23:35.691 --> 23:38.452
There's no cosmic GPS

23:38.453 --> 23:41.904
telling me where or how far to go.

23:42.858 --> 23:44.198
And I'm ready.

23:44.740 --> 23:49.303
I'm ready to throw out
the fucking map and go off-road.

23:49.304 --> 23:50.945
Who is with me?

23:52.668 --> 23:54.550
I said, "Who's with me"?

23:57.352 --> 23:59.273
He's losing them.

23:59.274 --> 24:01.836
Maybe the hippies,
but they're here for yoga and massage.

24:01.837 --> 24:04.038
Look at the rest of them,
the young ones.

24:04.039 --> 24:06.681
The bottom line is...
He's reaching them.

24:06.682 --> 24:08.082
the universe doesn't work for us.

24:08.083 --> 24:09.924
Let's get this out. I want it online.

24:09.925 --> 24:11.485
It doesn't give a shit about...

24:11.486 --> 24:13.928
Let's see if Charlie Haverford
can go viral.

24:13.929 --> 24:17.011
It's up to all of us, all of us,

24:17.012 --> 24:20.442
to decide for ourselves
how things shake out.

24:21.657 --> 24:24.530
Where do you want to go?
What do you want to do?

24:25.140 --> 24:28.450
And who do you want
to share this journey with?

24:28.864 --> 24:30.745
Do you want be a tourist?

24:30.746 --> 24:33.347
Do you want to stay
on the sidelines and just watch?

24:33.348 --> 24:34.869
No.

24:34.870 --> 24:36.831
You want to get behind
the wheel and drive.

24:36.832 --> 24:38.192
Yes.
Then say it.

24:38.193 --> 24:39.754
I want to drive.
Say it again!

24:39.755 --> 24:41.316
I want to drive.

24:55.811 --> 24:57.612
Hey, where are you?

24:57.613 --> 24:59.894
I'll be right there. Okay.

24:59.895 --> 25:01.416
Shit!

25:08.183 --> 25:09.745
Hey.
Hi.

25:19.074 --> 25:21.355
So, when does your mom get home?

25:21.356 --> 25:23.037
I don't really know anymore.

25:23.038 --> 25:25.039
Uh, sometimes Nora comes over,

25:25.040 --> 25:27.361
and sometimes my mom goes to Nora's.

25:27.362 --> 25:28.843
Who's Nora?

25:28.844 --> 25:32.527
Uh, my dad's doctor,
therapist, or something.

25:32.528 --> 25:34.889
Is he okay?
They don't tell me much,

25:34.890 --> 25:38.252
but from what I hear from the walls,
he's doing better, yeah.

25:38.253 --> 25:41.315
So, then, why does your dad's
doctor keep coming over?

25:42.177 --> 25:44.139
I don't know. She's pregnant.

25:46.982 --> 25:48.739
My mom likes her.

25:50.586 --> 25:53.427
Yeah, I don't know.
My family's fucking crazy.

25:55.911 --> 25:57.581
I'm crazy about you.

26:14.930 --> 26:17.972
It's been two weeks.
Now, I want the rent by tomorrow,

26:17.973 --> 26:19.493
or I'm going to raze your shop

26:19.494 --> 26:22.136
and make it into my own,
personal parking garage.

26:22.137 --> 26:25.339
We clear? Don't make me do that.
I know you're a nice man.

26:25.340 --> 26:26.701
Excuse me.

26:26.702 --> 26:29.263
Hi!
Where's the Bimmer?

26:29.264 --> 26:32.186
Charlie doesn't want me driving it.

26:32.187 --> 26:34.749
Now that he's a rock star
on the self-help circuit,

26:34.750 --> 26:37.225
he doesn't want any hint of impropriety.

26:38.393 --> 26:40.955
His words?
Yeah.

26:40.956 --> 26:43.277
Sounds like an asshole.

26:43.278 --> 26:44.799
So you in the shop full-time now?

26:44.800 --> 26:47.131
Yeah, seems that way.

26:48.163 --> 26:50.805
Speak of the devil.
I'll see you later.

26:50.806 --> 26:52.928
Hi.
Hey, there.

26:53.529 --> 26:57.291
Am I on speaker?
Yeah, sorry. I'm working.

26:57.292 --> 27:02.056
So, listen, we're thinking
about adding another weekend.

27:02.057 --> 27:03.978
"We"?
Yes, sorry.

27:03.979 --> 27:05.499
Linda, it's Maggie.

27:05.500 --> 27:07.021
Liz and Adam are here, as well.

27:07.022 --> 27:09.824
Hi, Mrs. Haverford. Don't mind us.

27:09.825 --> 27:12.507
How's Paz doing?

27:12.508 --> 27:15.200
Much better. Think he'll be out soon.

27:16.031 --> 27:17.792
Charlie, he's been asking for you.

27:17.793 --> 27:19.754
He wants to come visit when he gets out.

27:19.755 --> 27:21.315
Oh, I'll send a car.

27:21.316 --> 27:24.118
I was thinking I would drive him myself.

27:24.119 --> 27:26.641
What about Nick?
I'll bring him, too.

27:26.642 --> 27:29.163
Be great for him to see
what you've been up to.

27:29.164 --> 27:30.965
Sure, that sounds great.

27:30.966 --> 27:32.967
Maybe wait until you get here

27:32.968 --> 27:35.169
to tell him about
the "no phones allowed" rule.

27:35.170 --> 27:37.491
Hey, you bet.
I got to go.

27:48.784 --> 27:51.385
I'm sorry, but we can't give refunds

27:51.386 --> 27:53.708
after the retreat has already started.

27:53.709 --> 27:55.469
If you'll look at your
terms and conditions...

27:55.470 --> 27:57.712
I don't care about
the terms and conditions.

27:57.713 --> 27:59.313
Marty, Marty. What's going on?

27:59.314 --> 28:01.355
Oh. Hey, Charlie.

28:01.356 --> 28:05.880
Marty here was just expressing
his dissatisfaction

28:05.881 --> 28:07.503
with our new direction.

28:08.403 --> 28:11.365
It's not you. It's me. I just...

28:11.366 --> 28:13.928
I think maybe I need a little
more coddling with my self-help.

28:13.929 --> 28:15.369
That's totally fine.

28:15.370 --> 28:17.721
My techniques are not for everyone.

28:18.493 --> 28:21.616
Yeah,
so I guess the new you and the old me

28:21.617 --> 28:23.177
just aren't a great fit, then.

28:23.178 --> 28:24.619
Well, we wouldn't want you to stay

28:24.620 --> 28:26.541
if you're not getting
anything out of it.

28:26.542 --> 28:27.782
Give him his refund.

28:27.783 --> 28:29.985
I'm not allowed to...
Do it.

28:34.029 --> 28:35.910
I don't have to wear anything weird,
do I?

28:35.911 --> 28:37.825
Define "weird."

28:38.914 --> 28:41.161
I don't know, like a toga or something.

28:41.637 --> 28:46.120
More like a karate outfit
or something you play tennis in.

28:46.121 --> 28:48.242
Oh. Okay.

28:48.243 --> 28:51.245
That sounds cool, I guess.

28:51.246 --> 28:54.729
Unfortunately,
this one's being stubborn.

28:54.730 --> 28:56.170
I want to go. I really do.

28:56.171 --> 28:58.492
It's just, you know,
I'm on-call this weekend.

28:58.493 --> 28:59.854
I know.
You know I tried

28:59.855 --> 29:03.642
to get out of it.
I know!

29:04.299 --> 29:07.582
So, I'm...
I'm thinking this would be good.

29:07.583 --> 29:09.565
For the crib?
Mm-hmm.

29:10.305 --> 29:12.386
The crib?
Yeah.

29:12.387 --> 29:13.748
Nora's going to stay with us

29:13.749 --> 29:15.590
once she's closer to her due date

29:15.591 --> 29:17.952
and maybe a little after.

29:28.043 --> 29:30.419
And triangle pose.

29:33.809 --> 29:34.690
Yeah. Thanks.

29:34.691 --> 29:36.592
Steady breathing.

29:38.093 --> 29:39.854
Warrior II.

29:47.302 --> 29:49.784
Hands at your heart center.

29:53.829 --> 29:56.511
Oh... my God.

29:56.512 --> 29:58.405
Well, well.

29:59.715 --> 30:01.557
Look what the Lambo dragged in.

30:04.159 --> 30:07.883
What, no valet?
Nor is this the parking lot.

30:09.885 --> 30:12.166
in and out...

30:12.167 --> 30:14.488
Babe,
I think they just got self-parking.

30:14.489 --> 30:15.970
Oh, that's disgusting.

30:15.971 --> 30:17.852
I know, but you don't mind, right?

30:17.853 --> 30:20.334
Not for you, sweetie.

30:20.335 --> 30:21.616
I miss you.

30:21.617 --> 30:24.298
You've been busy.

30:24.299 --> 30:26.741
Going international?

30:26.742 --> 30:29.343
I have no fucking clue
what country he's from,

30:29.344 --> 30:31.506
or, to be honest,
how to pronounce his name.

30:31.507 --> 30:33.828
It's like Totten-something.

30:33.829 --> 30:35.069
Totenberg? I don't know.

30:35.070 --> 30:36.871
I've been calling him Toto.

30:36.872 --> 30:39.233
He thinks it's cute.
Vegas mark?

30:39.234 --> 30:41.395
Yeah, he's, like, royalty or something.

30:41.396 --> 30:43.678
All I know...
He's got a shit-ton of Euros.

30:43.679 --> 30:45.035
Pay for that?

30:46.201 --> 30:47.955
Among other things.

30:48.443 --> 30:50.165
Why the fuck are you here?

30:58.694 --> 31:00.968
More like building a
better bank account.

31:02.137 --> 31:03.778
The glasses are fucking ridiculous.

31:03.779 --> 31:07.101
Where is he?

31:07.102 --> 31:09.704
Where's my big bro?
Busy.

31:09.705 --> 31:12.628
In the meantime, there's someone
here you owe an apology to.

31:23.238 --> 31:26.921
To think, man,
you're that good at your first con.

31:26.922 --> 31:29.371
Are you kidding me?

31:31.807 --> 31:34.328
Got a lot of potential, kiddo.

31:34.329 --> 31:36.892
Next time I go to Vegas,
you should definitely come with me.

31:41.296 --> 31:44.258
Don't take it personally.
I needed the money.

31:44.259 --> 31:46.261
You didn't even know
if it was going to work.

31:48.744 --> 31:50.945
A situation presents itself,
you take advantage of it.

31:50.946 --> 31:53.588
That's kind of the first rule
of what we do.

31:53.589 --> 31:55.710
So you burn your own nephew?
That's what you do?

31:55.711 --> 31:58.473
I know.
It sucks how it all had to happen.

32:02.037 --> 32:03.155
Hey!

32:11.486 --> 32:13.328
I needed it to fix this.

32:15.971 --> 32:18.211
My face is my business, and...

32:19.214 --> 32:20.922
business was shit.

32:23.258 --> 32:24.979
It was a one-time thing. I'm sorry.

32:24.980 --> 32:26.662
It won't happen again.

32:32.788 --> 32:34.478
They did a good job.

32:35.030 --> 32:36.231
Right?

32:38.233 --> 32:40.676
Thanks to you, business is booming.

32:46.682 --> 32:48.883
Okay, okay.

32:48.884 --> 32:50.660
You didn't join me.

32:51.166 --> 32:53.127
I'm wondering why.

32:53.128 --> 32:54.769
This is a sacred place.

32:54.770 --> 32:56.370
I know. You told me.

32:56.371 --> 32:58.585
Just before you smacked me one.

32:59.214 --> 33:01.095
I'm sorry about that.

33:01.096 --> 33:02.537
I often found solace here,

33:02.538 --> 33:06.661
and now all I feel is just unclean,

33:06.662 --> 33:08.583
unworthy...

33:08.584 --> 33:10.665
Unworthy or unclenched?

33:10.666 --> 33:12.907
Oh.

33:12.908 --> 33:14.870
Definitely clenched.

33:16.632 --> 33:19.439
I feel confused. I feel scared.

33:20.676 --> 33:22.397
You're a mess.

33:25.601 --> 33:26.881
Agreed.

33:26.882 --> 33:28.824
But I know what you're going through.

33:29.725 --> 33:31.485
I know how you feel. You feel lonely.

33:31.486 --> 33:33.929
You feel abandoned. You feel like...

33:36.251 --> 33:37.415
you've failed.

33:38.854 --> 33:40.576
But who have you failed?

33:43.058 --> 33:45.219
My friends, my family,

33:45.220 --> 33:46.633
my fo...
Wrong.

33:48.223 --> 33:50.264
You feel scared and confused

33:50.265 --> 33:54.029
because you fear
you've failed the universe.

33:56.271 --> 33:57.672
I don't know.

33:57.673 --> 33:59.834
You think the universe is looking down

33:59.835 --> 34:01.916
on you, its conduit,

34:01.917 --> 34:04.278
disappointed and disgusted.

34:04.279 --> 34:06.681
And you just can't figure out why.

34:06.682 --> 34:10.204
And I'm here to tell you,
Paz, that's fucked up.

34:10.205 --> 34:12.766
Just because the universe speaks to us,

34:12.768 --> 34:16.204
doesn't mean that he, she,
or it isn't full of shit.

34:17.572 --> 34:20.417
Why do we always assume
we are the problem?

34:21.335 --> 34:24.539
Why can't the universe
be wrong sometimes?

34:24.540 --> 34:28.101
Why can't it be vain, petty,

34:28.103 --> 34:30.927
and quite frankly, an asshole?

34:34.268 --> 34:37.190
You know, they say the universe
works in mysterious ways.

34:37.192 --> 34:40.313
Why? Why all the mystery?

34:40.315 --> 34:43.356
Why can't it just fucking
tell us what it all means?

34:44.438 --> 34:46.161
What is it afraid of?

34:54.530 --> 34:56.369
I love you, Charlie.

34:57.212 --> 35:00.214
Tilting at windmills,
but you own it, man.

35:00.215 --> 35:02.096
I don't know what else to do.

35:02.097 --> 35:04.338
I can't say I hold with your cosmology,

35:04.339 --> 35:05.462
but...

35:07.703 --> 35:10.305
I'm inspired by your struggles.

35:13.549 --> 35:14.763
You got guts.

35:16.912 --> 35:18.674
You never give up.

35:21.276 --> 35:24.478
I would like to rejoin the fight.

35:32.808 --> 35:36.490
Now, once launched,
the app will broadcast, record,

35:36.491 --> 35:40.163
and transcribe everything
you hear or say.

35:41.136 --> 35:43.458
So all I got to do is talk?
Yeah.

35:44.499 --> 35:45.900
Now, why don't you try it.

35:45.901 --> 35:47.903
Talk into it and watch.

35:51.426 --> 35:52.425
Testing.

35:53.949 --> 35:55.262
Testing.

35:56.912 --> 35:58.913
Okay, let me reiterate.

35:58.914 --> 36:02.517
It is imperative that Turner acknowledge

36:02.644 --> 36:05.079
these weapons as stolen goods

36:05.080 --> 36:08.523
and that he negotiate
a fair price with Cordero.

36:08.524 --> 36:09.567
Hmm?

36:10.566 --> 36:11.569
Got it.

36:12.688 --> 36:14.698
And let me reiterate.

36:15.811 --> 36:18.013
I do this thing for you...

36:20.415 --> 36:23.915
my family stays safe...

36:24.740 --> 36:25.875
forever.

36:26.662 --> 36:27.877
Family,

36:28.744 --> 36:31.385
as defined by Rita Marks
and your two daughters...

36:31.386 --> 36:32.548
only.

36:37.352 --> 36:40.715
What about your business partner,
Bustamante?

36:40.716 --> 36:42.637
Are you prepared for him to go down?

36:42.638 --> 36:47.041
Whoa.
Nobody is going down tonight, okay?

36:47.042 --> 36:48.603
If this leads to an arrest,

36:48.604 --> 36:51.192
we'll have shown our hand
and destroyed our case.

36:52.327 --> 36:55.650
This is just a meetand-greet, Fonso.

36:55.651 --> 36:57.092
Nothing more.

37:04.540 --> 37:08.824
I read you loud and clear.

37:18.233 --> 37:22.598
Our belongings are no different
than our own self-worth.

37:30.285 --> 37:31.691
It is us...

37:32.888 --> 37:35.904
who determine their value.

37:37.412 --> 37:39.366
He said to never sell it.

37:40.816 --> 37:44.245
He said, "No price could ever be put

37:45.300 --> 37:46.873
on its worth."

37:48.063 --> 37:50.104
He knew I didn't need the money.

37:50.105 --> 37:52.186
For you, it wasn't about the money...

37:52.187 --> 37:54.589
unlike your relationship with him.

37:55.831 --> 37:59.314
Well, he was a provider.
He gave us everything we wanted.

38:03.278 --> 38:08.043
But you'd give it all back
for just one more day with him.

38:12.808 --> 38:16.027
He was given it as a gift
the day I was born...

38:17.372 --> 38:20.735
the happiest day of his life
is what he told me.

38:25.581 --> 38:29.223
And now you know
that money can't get you back

38:29.224 --> 38:33.387
any more time, nor someone's love.

38:33.388 --> 38:37.173
But underneath all that neglect,
all that pain,

38:38.033 --> 38:40.009
lives a better you.

38:41.196 --> 38:43.388
Free yourself, friend.

38:45.080 --> 38:47.475
Let us help you build someone better.

38:47.963 --> 38:49.925
Do you want to build someone better?

38:52.007 --> 38:53.247
Yes?
No, I'm the one

38:53.248 --> 38:55.009
asking you the question.

38:55.010 --> 38:59.374
Do you want to build someone better?

39:04.179 --> 39:06.581
I want to build someone better.
Yes!

39:06.582 --> 39:08.584
Oww! Oww, oww!

39:33.609 --> 39:35.449
Ladies and gentlemen,

39:35.450 --> 39:39.774
I would like to introduce you
to Charles the Magnificent.

39:39.775 --> 39:42.056
Ah, thank you.
I would love to put on a show,

39:42.057 --> 39:44.058
but, unfortunately,

39:44.059 --> 39:47.942
like usual, my sister comes unprepared.

39:47.943 --> 39:50.079
Or does she?

39:51.146 --> 39:52.624
Oh.

39:53.268 --> 39:55.550
Freshly stolen, I presume?

39:55.551 --> 39:56.951
The best kind.

40:14.570 --> 40:16.170
Nora didn't make it?

40:16.171 --> 40:18.358
No. Work.

40:18.814 --> 40:22.096
How is she getting on
after all this Paz business?

40:22.097 --> 40:24.098
I think she feels bad
she couldn't do more.

40:24.099 --> 40:27.461
Mm. There's nothing she could have done.

40:27.462 --> 40:30.585
Unfortunately,
Paz has become very reliant

40:30.586 --> 40:32.787
on hypnotism.

40:32.788 --> 40:35.269
I'm afraid he can't function without it.

40:35.270 --> 40:39.595
Without that connection to the universe,
he's... lost.

40:41.597 --> 40:45.119
Does Charlie know?
Of course.

40:45.120 --> 40:47.763
How do you think he got Paz
to go to the hospital?

40:50.445 --> 40:52.086
Show me.

41:05.380 --> 41:07.657
I'm told it's very soothing...

41:08.143 --> 41:10.505
the perfume of the flower,

41:10.506 --> 41:12.827
the rhythm of the movement.

41:12.828 --> 41:15.290
It induces a hypnotic state.

41:16.672 --> 41:18.167
He has no idea.

41:19.394 --> 41:21.379
I devised a trigger word,

41:22.277 --> 41:26.320
one which puts him into
a deep state of relaxation

41:26.321 --> 41:30.606
so he can receive information,
instruction.

41:35.410 --> 41:36.771
Instruction?

41:36.772 --> 41:39.534
I'm sorry.

41:39.535 --> 41:42.777
II just find it so difficult

41:42.778 --> 41:46.060
to believe that you fell for this.

41:46.061 --> 41:50.065
Are you listening? Really?

41:54.750 --> 41:57.792
And this is all just
a fucking game to you.

41:57.793 --> 42:00.877
A game you and Charlie
built a livelihood on.

42:01.917 --> 42:03.880
I care about my clients.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.601
More than their money?

42:06.602 --> 42:08.217
Paz trusted you.

42:09.404 --> 42:11.967
He depended on you.

42:14.289 --> 42:16.976
You made him believe that he had a gift.

42:18.213 --> 42:21.976
And now he doesn't need it.
Because you don't need him.

42:21.977 --> 42:25.109
And Charlie doesn't need you.

42:26.942 --> 42:30.225
He is done saving you.

42:34.109 --> 42:37.712
It is time, Linda, to move on.

43:57.232 --> 44:00.035
They call it a Mexican Bloody Mary.

44:02.077 --> 44:03.583
What's this, uh...

44:04.960 --> 44:06.419
What's that on the edge?

44:07.002 --> 44:08.883
Tajin spices.

44:08.884 --> 44:10.845
Adds a little kick to it.

44:18.173 --> 44:20.655
Oh, man!

44:20.656 --> 44:22.101
Good, right?

44:22.858 --> 44:24.138
It's got an aftertaste.

44:24.139 --> 44:27.421
Yeah. Probably the clam juice

44:27.422 --> 44:29.609
or the Worcestershire sauce.

44:30.425 --> 44:31.778
New phone?

44:32.948 --> 44:34.655
Uh, yeah.

44:35.150 --> 44:37.111
Got a new plan.

45:02.017 --> 45:03.978
Hey.

45:06.702 --> 45:09.824
Hey. Get you something to drink?

45:09.825 --> 45:12.026
After we do some business.

45:12.027 --> 45:14.549
And you must be...
Turner.

45:14.550 --> 45:15.950
They call me "Big Jim".

45:15.951 --> 45:18.115
I run the West Coast Kompania.

45:19.034 --> 45:20.394
King of the Gypsies?

45:23.158 --> 45:25.079
We prefer Romani.

45:25.080 --> 45:28.042
But, yeah, I'm in charge.

45:28.043 --> 45:31.125
Yo soy en cargo, ese.

45:35.290 --> 45:36.611
I guess you were right

45:36.612 --> 45:38.719
about you being the middle man, huh?

45:39.895 --> 45:41.776
Have a seat.

46:02.918 --> 46:04.559
Nora?

46:07.242 --> 46:09.083
Nora!

46:11.807 --> 46:13.848
Fuck.

46:13.849 --> 46:15.850
Nora.

47:21.036 --> 47:22.436
Fonso!

47:22.437 --> 47:24.038
Open up! I know you're in there!

47:24.039 --> 47:25.560
Open the fucking door. I just...

47:25.561 --> 47:27.241
I need her keys.

47:27.242 --> 47:31.766
I need her fucking keys.
I need Gina's keys.

47:31.767 --> 47:33.047
Open it!

47:36.331 --> 47:37.972
Special Agent Simms, FBI.

47:37.973 --> 47:39.774
I need you to sit here and be quiet.

47:39.775 --> 47:41.616
We'll talk to you in a little bit.

48:02.918 --> 48:06.521
Shit.
What the fuck?

48:06.522 --> 48:09.524
Yeah, Fonso, what the fuck?

48:09.525 --> 48:11.247
Thought I was your partner.

48:12.487 --> 48:14.417
Not on this one.

48:16.331 --> 48:18.092
Please.
What, "please?"

48:18.093 --> 48:19.894
You fuck me over,
and all you have to say

48:19.895 --> 48:22.096
is "please," you fuck?

48:22.097 --> 48:24.343
What am I supposed to say to that,
"Thank you"?

48:25.260 --> 48:27.341
How 'bout the both of you
shut the fuck up, huh?

48:27.342 --> 48:28.543
Oh!

48:29.585 --> 48:31.946
Stay here. Stay down.

48:31.947 --> 48:33.548
FBI. Don't move!

48:41.236 --> 48:42.958
Move it!
Move!

48:47.082 --> 48:50.164
Agent down! Agent down!

48:50.165 --> 48:51.328
Down!

48:52.367 --> 48:53.648
Oh!

48:53.649 --> 48:55.449
Aah!

48:59.014 --> 49:00.374
I'm here! I'm here.

49:00.375 --> 49:03.298
I got you. I got you. He's coming.

49:06.341 --> 49:07.678
Aah!

49:18.353 --> 49:20.836
Aah!

49:56.227 --> 49:59.193
Orson Welles said it was
an occupational disease

49:59.194 --> 50:03.000
when charlatans start
believing the hype.

50:05.280 --> 50:08.282
Magicians and mind-readers...
They have a term for it.

50:08.283 --> 50:10.449
It's called a "shut eye."
That's what happened to me.

50:10.886 --> 50:13.410
After a while, it was just all too easy.

50:14.850 --> 50:17.932
I didn't have to study people
like I used to.

50:17.933 --> 50:19.583
One look at them,

50:20.816 --> 50:23.138
and my eye did the math.

50:25.140 --> 50:29.183
I thought, did the universe...

50:29.184 --> 50:32.429
the universe give me this gift?

50:33.509 --> 50:36.831
Fuck no! I am the gift.

50:36.832 --> 50:40.875
The gift has been within me all along.

50:40.876 --> 50:42.565
And it's within you.

50:43.599 --> 50:46.681
And you. And you.

50:46.682 --> 50:49.564
Charlie.
All of you.

50:49.565 --> 50:51.446
Charlie.

50:58.774 --> 51:00.174
Linda?

51:06.702 --> 51:08.583
Hi. I'm, uh... I'm Charlie Haverford.

51:08.584 --> 51:10.104
My wife, Linda Haverford, she's here.

51:10.105 --> 51:14.597
Uh, Haverford. H-a-v-e-r-f-o-r-d.

51:15.631 --> 51:17.111
I'm so sorry.

51:21.837 --> 51:24.278
Syl, Syl.
Charlie. Oh, my God.

51:24.279 --> 51:25.800
What... What... What did they say?

51:25.801 --> 51:27.522
So, she just got out of surgery,

51:27.523 --> 51:29.564
but they're saying she needs more.

51:32.768 --> 51:34.849
Charlie. Charlie.

51:34.850 --> 51:36.410
They're about to take her back in,

51:36.411 --> 51:39.093
but she wants to see you, first, okay?

51:39.094 --> 51:42.256
Hey. Just your dad, buddy.

51:42.257 --> 51:43.578
Okay?

52:31.266 --> 52:33.508
Ch-Charlie.

52:33.509 --> 52:34.949
Hey.

52:34.950 --> 52:36.991
Cha-Charlie.

52:36.992 --> 52:38.430
Charlie.

52:39.635 --> 52:41.225
Yeah.

52:51.366 --> 52:52.820
Hey.

52:53.288 --> 52:55.364
Go fuck yourself.
