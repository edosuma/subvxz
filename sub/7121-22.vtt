00:38.830 --> 00:40.082
Phew.

00:40.165 --> 00:43.419
"Rainicornicopia...

00:43.502 --> 00:46.096
An Unabridged History
of the Rainicorns."

00:46.171 --> 00:47.468
Whatever, man.

00:47.548 --> 00:48.970
I barely made it
through the title.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.767
Listen, man, one day,

00:50.842 --> 00:53.140
I'm probably gonna have
half-rainbow pupsters.

00:53.220 --> 00:57.225
I got to be able to share
my babies' culture.

01:05.983 --> 01:07.985
Huh.

01:10.279 --> 01:12.953
Oh.

01:13.031 --> 01:15.079
Hey, this table is wobbly.

01:15.158 --> 01:17.428
We gotta take it to the Lost
Tinker Goblin of Fog Mountain

01:17.452 --> 01:18.544
to fix it.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.338
Dude, I would love to go

01:20.414 --> 01:22.337
on some crazy made-up
adventure with you,

01:22.416 --> 01:24.134
but I really gotta read this.

01:24.209 --> 01:26.962
So from here on out, I'm
just gonna ignore you.

01:30.007 --> 01:31.634
I don't make up adventures!

01:31.717 --> 01:34.015
Jake, you know that!

01:34.094 --> 01:37.439
Jake! I don't make
up adventures!

01:39.891 --> 01:41.768
Mm.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.324
Books... books...

01:47.399 --> 01:49.401
kitties... zitties...

01:49.484 --> 01:50.326

01:50.402 --> 01:52.075

cities...

01:56.658 --> 01:57.910
oh, no!

01:57.993 --> 02:01.418
Damaged books! Who did this?!

02:01.496 --> 02:04.045
Shh-ush!

02:04.124 --> 02:05.546
Sorry.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.675
I will avenge the
slightly soiled books.

02:08.753 --> 02:10.722
Gotta tell Jake.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.305
Hello?

02:14.384 --> 02:16.057
Is someone back here?

02:16.136 --> 02:17.136
Are you stuck?

02:17.179 --> 02:20.433
Shh-ush-oom.

02:20.515 --> 02:23.143
Hello?

02:23.226 --> 02:24.443
Whoa!

02:24.519 --> 02:25.691
Oh!

02:25.771 --> 02:27.694
Hey, there's pages coming
out of these books!

02:27.773 --> 02:29.775
Shhhhhh!

02:31.693 --> 02:32.819
Who are you dudes?

02:32.903 --> 02:34.871
We are the Pagelings!

02:34.946 --> 02:38.325
I am Paper Pete, the
leader of the Pagelings,

02:38.408 --> 02:40.627
but you can call me P.P.

02:40.702 --> 02:41.874
I'll call you Pete.

02:41.953 --> 02:42.875
Okay.

02:42.954 --> 02:44.877
Why are you dudes
in the library?

02:44.956 --> 02:48.506
We are the secret guardians
of the books in the library.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.337
You know those blank
pieces of paper

02:50.420 --> 02:52.013
in the beginning of old books?

02:52.089 --> 02:53.887
- Yeah.
- That's us!

02:53.965 --> 02:56.218
We revealed ourselves
to you, noble giant,

02:56.301 --> 02:58.053
because you felt our plight

02:58.136 --> 03:00.605
when you saw the damaged books.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.649
And now is our darkest hour,

03:02.724 --> 03:05.193
for the Moldos have
been growing more bold

03:05.268 --> 03:06.520
with every attack.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.480
Look at the damage
done yesterday

03:08.563 --> 03:11.692
at "The Battle of Teddy
Bear Joke Book."

03:11.775 --> 03:12.992
Wow. Yeah.

03:13.068 --> 03:15.912
They're massing for a
full-scale assault

03:15.987 --> 03:17.955
on every book in the library.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.375
Gosh! Even the
"Rainicornicopia"?

03:20.450 --> 03:21.872
Yes.

03:21.952 --> 03:23.374
I better tell Jake.

03:23.453 --> 03:24.670
Don't you dudes go anywhere.

03:24.746 --> 03:27.499
Okay.

03:27.582 --> 03:29.380
Hey, bro. I've got an adventure.

03:29.459 --> 03:30.676
It's not made-up.

03:30.752 --> 03:32.299
There are these...
These Pagelings.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.473
They came out from...
From books, and they...

03:34.548 --> 03:37.552
They folded into little animals.

03:37.634 --> 03:40.228
Do you hear what I'm saying?!

03:40.303 --> 03:41.225
Shh!

03:41.304 --> 03:45.104
You think I'm making this up?

03:45.183 --> 03:47.402
I'll prove it to you!

03:49.312 --> 03:51.906
Finn! Finn! You butt chicken!

03:53.442 --> 03:55.240
Jake, wait 'til you see 'em.

03:55.318 --> 03:57.446
Whoa!

03:57.529 --> 03:59.156
- Oh, my goodness!
- Oh, golly!

03:59.239 --> 04:01.492
Ow!

04:04.536 --> 04:06.538
They were just here!

04:09.040 --> 04:11.384
Pagelings?

04:11.460 --> 04:13.929
Why didn't you dudes introduce
yourselves to Jake?

04:14.004 --> 04:16.302
We don't want to reveal
ourselves to anyone else.

04:16.380 --> 04:20.351
We are the <i>secret</i> guardians...
Secret.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.350
Um...

04:22.429 --> 04:26.354
yeah, but Jake is a
powerful giant, like me.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.356
He can help you battle or...
Or whatevs.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.403
But first, you must
win his favor.

04:30.479 --> 04:32.982
Do you not want victory
for your people?

04:33.064 --> 04:35.817
Yes! We do want victory!

04:35.901 --> 04:39.326
Come on. Follow me.

04:39.404 --> 04:42.749
Jake, look.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.872
He's up here reading a book.

04:48.497 --> 04:50.420
Do something to get
his attention.

04:50.499 --> 04:53.343
Very well. We shall
dance as flowers.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.795
Hoopha!

04:54.878 --> 04:56.425
Okay-

05:01.259 --> 05:05.389
Ooh! Ahh! Cha! Cha! Cha!

05:05.472 --> 05:08.021
Jake! The Pagelings
are dancing for you!

05:08.099 --> 05:09.396
Just look up for a second!

05:09.476 --> 05:12.480
Finn, all the little voices
you're doing are cute,

05:12.562 --> 05:15.566
but come on, man,
just let me read.

05:18.693 --> 05:23.244
By wearing the beast, we
shall become like the beast!

05:23.323 --> 05:25.200
You can feel them, can't you?

05:25.283 --> 05:27.126
I can feel you pinching me.

05:27.202 --> 05:28.749
Just look up for a second.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.002
Loo-o-o-o-o-o-o-k!

05:32.123 --> 05:33.716
Pagelings, I'm sorry,

05:33.792 --> 05:36.261
but my giant friend is
acting like a clump.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.508
Okay.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.214
We can't wait any longer.

05:39.297 --> 05:41.140
We must go back to the bookshelf

05:41.216 --> 05:43.310
to prepare for the
Moldos' attack.

05:43.385 --> 05:46.059
Yeah, go play make-believe
somewhere else.

05:46.137 --> 05:49.812
I'm not making believe!

05:49.891 --> 05:52.940
We were gone too long!

05:55.021 --> 05:57.274
Wield, my brethren! Wield!

06:06.950 --> 06:07.826
[I blows]

06:07.909 --> 06:09.957
Aaaaah!

06:13.957 --> 06:16.210
You win this battle,
but next time,

06:16.293 --> 06:17.761
We will win it.

06:17.836 --> 06:18.962
Yes! Leave!

06:19.045 --> 06:20.046
Yes! We did it!

06:20.130 --> 06:21.803
Veni, vidi, vici!

06:21.882 --> 06:24.510
So, those little, squishy
guys are the Moldos?

06:24.593 --> 06:25.593
Aye.

06:25.635 --> 06:28.104
This was but a
reconnaissance squad

06:28.179 --> 06:30.773
sent to test our mettle.

06:30.849 --> 06:32.271
Mettle!

06:32.350 --> 06:34.398
Uh-huh. They... they seem tough.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.900
Their bites sting
like the dickens.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.857
Hmm.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.034
Their bites sting, eh?

06:41.109 --> 06:42.702
I've got a plan, Pete.

06:42.777 --> 06:44.495
Tell me your plan, giant.

06:44.571 --> 06:45.823
Just trust me.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.908
Trust me.

07:00.837 --> 07:03.090
You've discovered the
Moldos' secret lair!

07:03.173 --> 07:06.598
Eh, it wasn't very hard.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.933
Wippa Wippa waaaaa!

07:13.016 --> 07:15.360
The Pagelings have
a battle beast!

07:15.435 --> 07:17.278
Attack!

07:17.354 --> 07:19.152
Whoa, whoa, whoa, moldy blobs.

07:19.230 --> 07:21.653
I've come here to help the
Moldos <i>defeat</i> the Pagelings.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.406
Traitor!

07:23.485 --> 07:24.907
Hyah! Yah!

07:24.986 --> 07:26.488
Calm down. This is
part of my plan.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.949
Oh! Ha ha!

07:29.032 --> 07:31.626
Then I shall play
along, wise giant.

07:31.701 --> 07:33.749
How are we to trust you?

07:33.828 --> 07:35.751
Well... here... look! I
brought y'all a prisoner.

07:35.830 --> 07:37.457
It's their leader.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.463
May you rot in tartarus!

07:39.542 --> 07:43.297
May your skin boil and
eyes burst into flames

07:43.380 --> 07:45.303
forever in a pit!

07:52.597 --> 07:54.599
Traitor!

07:54.683 --> 07:58.654
So, do you guys have, like,
a leader or something?

08:01.815 --> 08:03.488
Mildwin!

08:03.566 --> 08:07.241
I'm Mildwin, leader
of the Moldos.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.540
Oh. Uh... hmm.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.577
Nice to meet you, your highness.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.253
I'm not a king.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.547
I was democratically elected.

08:17.622 --> 08:20.091
That's adorable.

08:20.166 --> 08:23.090
Now, Finn! Yah! Hunh! Hyah!

08:23.169 --> 08:25.046
Protect the elected official!

08:26.798 --> 08:28.095
Well-played, oh, giant.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.677
You have the cunning
of Odysseus.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.352
Pete, j-just stop winking.

08:32.429 --> 08:34.602
Yo! Yah! Yah!

08:34.681 --> 08:36.149
Hyoh! Hyoh! Yah!

08:36.224 --> 08:37.645
Shh!

08:39.852 --> 08:40.900
Hup-hup!

08:40.979 --> 08:42.697
Ignore... this!

08:43.773 --> 08:45.116
Hmm?

08:45.191 --> 08:46.943
This tastes delicious!

08:48.153 --> 08:49.746
Aah! Aah! Aah!

08:49.821 --> 08:51.448
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

08:54.034 --> 08:55.957
What did you do to me?!

08:56.036 --> 08:57.288
Aaaaaaaaaaah!

08:57.370 --> 08:58.872
- Uh...
- Aaaaaaaah!

08:58.955 --> 09:00.423
Uh... uhhh...

09:00.498 --> 09:02.125
Come on, you guys. Knock it off.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.003
The Moldos got a
taste for you now.

09:06.921 --> 09:08.423
Gotta do something!

09:08.506 --> 09:11.760
Where can I find ways to
solve problems in a library?

09:11.843 --> 09:12.844
Books?

09:14.804 --> 09:15.726
Aah!

09:15.805 --> 09:17.978
Books! Books! Books!

09:18.058 --> 09:18.980
Ehhhhh!

09:19.059 --> 09:21.278
Huh?

09:22.395 --> 09:24.739
What you nibbling me for?

09:24.814 --> 09:27.784
This sweaty stuff
tastes amazing!

09:27.859 --> 09:29.452
A-mazing!

09:29.527 --> 09:30.904
Hmm.

09:30.987 --> 09:32.864
Tastier than battle beast fur.

09:32.947 --> 09:34.949
Yes!

09:42.624 --> 09:43.876
Hey, Mildwin.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.631
- Mildwin!
- What?

09:45.710 --> 09:48.054
I bring a peace offering
from the Pagelings.

09:48.129 --> 09:49.130
Hmm?

09:55.261 --> 09:58.606
Finn, what's happening?

09:58.681 --> 10:00.058
Hang on, buddy.

10:00.141 --> 10:01.188
Paper Pete?

10:01.267 --> 10:02.644
Giant!

10:02.727 --> 10:05.071
Have you wiped out
the Moldo horde?

10:05.146 --> 10:06.773
No, man.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.324
The war's over.

10:08.399 --> 10:10.367
Mildwin, you can keep my shirt

10:10.443 --> 10:13.242
if you don't attack
their library books.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.198
Agreed, beast.

10:15.281 --> 10:19.661
This filthy garb will feed
my people for generations.

10:19.744 --> 10:22.497
And in 40 years, you
can have my shorts.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.173
Sound good, Pete?

10:24.249 --> 10:26.718
It will suffice.

10:26.793 --> 10:27.793
Sound good, Jake?

10:30.421 --> 10:31.421
Yaaaaaaaaaah!

10:32.340 --> 10:34.342
What... what the hecks, man?!

10:34.425 --> 10:35.677
What'd you do to me?!

10:35.760 --> 10:37.808
Look, man! Moldos and
Pagelings are real!

10:37.887 --> 10:41.767
Wha... who cares, man?!
I'm outta here!

10:41.850 --> 10:44.023
Did you finish your
Rainicorn book?

10:44.102 --> 10:46.696
Ugh. I was reading
the same paragraph

10:46.771 --> 10:48.865
over and over for
like 11 minutes.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.167
I guess I'm gonna
give up on learning

10:50.191 --> 10:52.569
everything about
Rainicorn history.

10:52.652 --> 10:53.653
Don't tell Lady.

10:53.736 --> 10:57.240
Oh. What about, uh, relating
to your mixed-species kids?

10:57.323 --> 10:59.917
Eh, I'll just fake it.

10:59.993 --> 11:00.994
Oh.

11:01.077 --> 11:03.671
Well... hey, man, I
think I see some...

11:03.746 --> 11:05.293
um... sun people

11:05.373 --> 11:06.920
in trouble on the
sun over there.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.877
- You making that up?
- Mm-hmm.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.928
Yeah! Let's do it!

11:11.004 --> 11:13.382
