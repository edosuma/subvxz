Hey, pal. Wow, that was
some party I had last night.

Your party was a week and a half ago.

[Vic] Whoa.

00:44.794 --> 00:49.883
It's Monday the 16th?
Oh, shit, I traveled forward in time, man.

00:49.966 --> 00:53.053
This day was important to me, I-- I think.

00:53.136 --> 00:56.097
You go back to work
at the radio station today.

00:56.181 --> 00:59.434
Well, that's right.
You really know the news.

Put a window in,
wire it, paint, wallpaper,

because I forgot to put the insulation in,

He's trash, Bill.
Okay, paddy wagon's leaving!

this close to turning into another Kevin.

There can be only one Kevin Murphy.

Now, why would I do that
to such a sweet, innocent child?

I'll pick you up after school
and coach you at practice.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.981
Then I'll take you home
after your auditions.

05:15.064 --> 05:17.817

to extracurricular activities.

Ah, thanks, pal.

I'll let you slide this time, Frank.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.610

It lifted my spirits
to see you all smiling as I drove up.

We-- We were happy that...
you look so good.

10:20.703 --> 10:25.916

It's just my residual stomach skin.

The technical term is a panniculus,
but I've named it Gordon. [gasps]

Back to sleep, my friend.

10:48.230 --> 10:50.149
Bob, you should go home.

10:50.232 --> 10:51.776
This is my home.

10:51.859 --> 10:55.988
The thought of coming back to Mohican
is what kept me alive.

of a young Salvadorian poet.

11:00.576 --> 11:05.665
I'm going to Mrs. Dunbarton

Okay, I'll drive you.

He teaches school 40 hours a week,

11:22.973 --> 11:25.518
sells shoes every night from four to nine,

11:25.601 --> 11:28.896
and fishes coins
out of municipal fountains on weekends.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.273
How many hours a week is he working

11:31.357 --> 11:35.403
to pay alimony to his ex-wife
and her new girlfriend?

11:36.696 --> 11:38.531
I thought, when couples dressed alike,

11:38.614 --> 11:40.950
it was a sign of how much
they loved each other.

11:44.203 --> 11:49.041
Well, don't all shout the answer
out at once, Nobel laureates.

your life and mine by...

I got one right.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.026
Oh, my God.

12:16.902 --> 12:18.738
I finally reached a student.

12:20.281 --> 12:21.991

12:22.074 --> 12:24.326

I'm thrilled you're back

Oh, man, I never thought I'd see the day
where I'd be working alongside you.

You are one of the all-time greats, man.

Thanks for letting me be a part
of what you're doing here.

Part of it? Brother, you're
not a part of it. You're a piece of it.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.445
That sounds like the same thing, man.

13:41.529 --> 13:45.616
Vic, you're gonna program
your own block of airtime

13:45.699 --> 13:48.494

and your type of music.

Nice audition, Maureen.

comes to the funeral
and shits in the hole,

23:38.792 --> 23:41.795
and then fucks your mom in the grave,
and your mom says,

23:41.878 --> 23:45.924
"Ooh, that's the best grave shit fucking
I've ever had, Bigfoot!
