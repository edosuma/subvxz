That was no wind.

01:42.852 --> 01:44.104
We are not alone.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.356
-Huh?

01:46.898 --> 01:47.732
There.

01:51.152 --> 01:52.904
-There!

01:54.906 --> 01:59.077
In the name of Maudra Fara,
I command you! Reveal yourself!

02:27.647 --> 02:29.524

02:30.316 --> 02:32.235
Hi.

Hm...

02:51.379 --> 02:54.048
"Thra's true balance will be found

02:54.424 --> 02:57.010
when natural order is sound."

02:57.969 --> 02:59.220
What does that mean?

03:07.979 --> 03:09.147
Hm.

03:09.606 --> 03:10.607
Huh?

03:13.526 --> 03:15.778
I hope it was supposed to do that.

03:18.781 --> 03:19.616
Oh...

03:38.259 --> 03:40.428
What is this place?

03:42.096 --> 03:44.224
Sifa. Spriton.

03:44.307 --> 03:45.266
Uh...

03:45.433 --> 03:46.476
Dousan.

03:46.935 --> 03:47.894
Grottan.

03:48.519 --> 03:49.604
Stonewood.

03:50.647 --> 03:53.191
Drenchen. It's the Seven Clans!

03:53.441 --> 03:55.276
And-- and, and there!

03:55.818 --> 03:56.819
Vapra.

03:57.737 --> 03:58.738
Hm...

03:59.405 --> 04:00.990
Seven symbols.

04:03.117 --> 04:05.453
The inscription above the door says,

04:06.037 --> 04:10.041
"Thra's true balance will be found

04:10.541 --> 04:13.795
when natural order is sound.”

04:14.420 --> 04:15.588
Huh.

04:18.549 --> 04:20.510
But what does it mean?

04:21.761 --> 04:22.762
Oh!

04:23.554 --> 04:24.722
It's a puzzle!

04:25.139 --> 04:26.766
Oh, I love puzzles!

04:27.058 --> 04:29.435
Oh... I have to...

04:29.769 --> 04:33.481
put the clans in their natural order,
from highest to lowest,

04:33.564 --> 04:35.817
and then Thra will be in balance.

04:36.609 --> 04:38.945
Well, Vapra is always first.

04:39.862 --> 04:41.322
But how...

04:49.080 --> 04:50.290
Oh...

04:51.207 --> 04:52.208
All right.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.185
It's working.

05:13.229 --> 05:14.063
The sound.

05:18.192 --> 05:21.696
Well, if Vapra is first,
then Stonewood is definitely second.

05:32.498 --> 05:33.541
I knew it.

05:37.211 --> 05:38.796
All right, who's next?

05:39.255 --> 05:40.798
Well, definitely not Grottan

05:41.341 --> 05:43.051
or Drenchen.

05:46.054 --> 05:49.474
Oh, but the Sifa, they know more
about symbols than any other clan.

05:54.270 --> 05:56.314
Yes! It must be the Sifa.

06:04.322 --> 06:05.573
Um...

06:06.324 --> 06:07.742
Or not.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.585
Every problem...

06:19.295 --> 06:20.630
has a solution.

06:50.993 --> 06:51.994
I demand more!

06:52.203 --> 06:53.830
- Mine!

07:02.004 --> 07:03.673
- I don't need a fork.
-Puh!

07:07.009 --> 07:08.094
Ah!

07:09.804 --> 07:11.139
-Oh!

07:14.183 --> 07:16.102
-Idiot.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.812
Ah! Ooh!

07:17.895 --> 07:21.399
Don't you look delicious? Yes, you do!

07:27.363 --> 07:29.115
Are you going to eat that?

07:29.282 --> 07:33.202
Touch my plate,
and you will draw back a ruined stump.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.246
Bah! Touchy.

07:40.751 --> 07:43.713
A special treat in honor of the return

07:44.172 --> 07:45.840
of the Ornamentalist!

07:45.923 --> 07:48.259
Lefar worms. My favorite.

07:48.342 --> 07:50.344
Best enjoyed still squirming.

07:52.430 --> 07:57.518
Even the tastiest meal
is no substitute for lovely essence.

07:57.935 --> 08:02.523
I can feel my portentous bulk
wasting away already.

08:02.648 --> 08:05.860
Bah! My strength wanes by the day.

08:05.943 --> 08:08.237
Essence, essence, essence!

08:08.321 --> 08:11.157
That's all any of you talk about
since I returned.

08:11.240 --> 08:14.243
It's my party. Talk about me!

08:14.327 --> 08:17.955
Bah! You cannot comprehend
the exquisite vitality it bestows

08:18.039 --> 08:19.665
until you have tried it for yourself.

08:20.082 --> 08:24.754
I too am eager to taste
this rejuvenating essence.

08:25.796 --> 08:28.674
-Then give us some!
-The essence is gone!

08:28.799 --> 08:32.386
-Stolen by a Gelfling.
-So make more.

08:32.470 --> 08:33.429
We can't!

08:34.055 --> 08:37.433
Useless Scientist's machine has broken.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.101
Calamity!

08:40.811 --> 08:43.940
Emperor has wisely locked the Scientist
away in the lab

08:44.023 --> 08:45.775
until the repairs are done.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.443
Once the machine is ready,

08:47.735 --> 08:51.656
we should drain
every last Gelfling across Thra!

08:51.739 --> 08:55.076
- Let the essence flow.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.912
Drain the Gelfling!

09:02.041 --> 09:06.462
A wise shepherd
does not cull entire herd, yes?

09:06.796 --> 09:10.591
We should take
only what Gelfling we need to survive.

09:10.675 --> 09:13.678
Moderation is for the meek!

09:13.761 --> 09:18.099
Immortality is our right.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.767
-Mm...

09:20.059 --> 09:22.144
This is all the Chamberlain's fault.

09:22.770 --> 09:26.107
It's because of you
our secrets roam the countryside

09:26.190 --> 09:29.193
in the mind of a renegade,
waiting to destroy us!

09:29.277 --> 09:32.196
I have turned all Gelfling against Rian!

09:32.655 --> 09:35.199
They believe his mind is infected.

09:35.283 --> 09:38.452
-Bah!
-Even his own father hunts him.

09:38.869 --> 09:41.872
Is good thing we are not all so weak

09:41.998 --> 09:46.252
as to be scared of single Gelfling, yes?

09:46.335 --> 09:47.295
Ah...

09:47.461 --> 09:48.838
You question my bravery?

09:48.921 --> 09:50.923
Keep your robes on, spithead!

09:58.598 --> 09:59.849
Incompetent smipp!

10:00.433 --> 10:02.393
-How exciting!

10:02.643 --> 10:06.272
You only dare flap your beak
because you sit at the Emperor's side.

10:06.606 --> 10:10.026
Let us see if your talons
are half as fearsome as your tongue!

10:10.109 --> 10:14.155
-I bring order! Peace!
-Ah! There's going to be a fight!

10:14.238 --> 10:17.533
A meal and a show!

10:17.617 --> 10:19.076
Ooh!

10:24.957 --> 10:28.210
You! You are reckless! Lead us into war!

10:28.294 --> 10:30.338
I welcome war!

10:33.841 --> 10:37.011
Because you are
too thick-headed to use brain.

10:37.094 --> 10:39.138
-Enough!

10:39.472 --> 10:40.598
Enough?

10:40.681 --> 10:41.599
Enough!

10:41.682 --> 10:44.602
The General is right.
I need results, not talk!

10:44.685 --> 10:47.772
-But, Emperor, my sire--
-Be silent,

10:47.855 --> 10:49.398
or I will silence you.

10:49.523 --> 10:53.194
-But-- but why? I did not start fight.

10:53.527 --> 10:55.321
You talk too much.

10:55.404 --> 10:57.406
Talk, talk, talk!

10:57.657 --> 10:59.575
We rot while you chatter!

10:59.659 --> 11:02.203
-Yes.
-Sire, my plan is working.

11:02.286 --> 11:05.956
-I just need more time.
-More time, more words,

11:06.040 --> 11:08.000
-more nothing!
- Forgive.

11:08.084 --> 11:09.168
Forgive.

11:09.585 --> 11:12.755
Forgiveness is for the feeble.
I need a new counsel.

11:12.838 --> 11:15.257
A counselor who understands
how to wield power.

11:15.341 --> 11:16.634
- Yes.
-General?

11:17.134 --> 11:18.094
-You...

11:18.177 --> 11:20.680
...will take Chamberlain's place
at my side.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.973
-I am honored, sire.
-No!

11:23.182 --> 11:25.017
-You are commanded.

11:26.477 --> 11:28.771
Do what the Chamberlain
has failed to do.

11:29.021 --> 11:32.233
-Bring this crisis to a swift end.
- As you command.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.485
Wait. But, sire, you can't!

11:34.568 --> 11:37.363
Look what have done!

11:40.741 --> 11:42.993
That's enough from you, weakling!

11:43.077 --> 11:44.453
How dare you!

11:48.541 --> 11:50.751
-My hand!

11:54.630 --> 11:56.424
-My lords!

11:56.549 --> 12:01.804
As our Emperor's new counsel,
I will capture this Rian

12:01.887 --> 12:04.557
and ensure the essence flows once more!

12:17.903 --> 12:19.447
Infernal Skeksis.

12:20.072 --> 12:21.490
Shriveled Pudgenubs.

12:21.615 --> 12:23.409
Upset balance.

12:23.492 --> 12:25.369
Seek life eternal. Bah!

12:25.619 --> 12:27.121
Everything grows old.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.415
Everything passes on. Hm.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.001
All, it seems, but Aughra.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.211
Agh, Aughra born old.

12:39.633 --> 12:41.469
And Thra's gone silent.

12:44.346 --> 12:45.389
Mm?

12:46.515 --> 12:48.559
Sometimes not silent enough!

12:52.062 --> 12:53.689
Has Thra stopped singing?

12:56.233 --> 12:57.359
Bah!

12:57.651 --> 12:58.486
What's this?

12:59.403 --> 13:00.654
It can't be!

13:01.071 --> 13:03.449
Can't be, but it is.

13:03.699 --> 13:05.701
Ah-ha...

13:06.118 --> 13:08.204
The Archer returns.

13:10.206 --> 13:13.584
Very well, Longneck. I'll follow.

13:18.380 --> 13:21.133
Lackadaisical Skeksis!

13:21.217 --> 13:23.219
They feast while we toil.

13:24.053 --> 13:28.682
But do not worry.
SkekTek never forgets a true friend.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.935
-Ah!

13:34.355 --> 13:35.773
- Scientist!
- Sire!

13:36.315 --> 13:40.569
Sire, I wasn't expecting
your imperial presence.

13:40.653 --> 13:44.990
And yet here I am, taking an interest
in your work and your...

13:48.744 --> 13:50.079
...friends.

13:51.705 --> 13:55.668
It must be hard
feeling so isolated from your kind

13:55.751 --> 14:00.130
that you must take solace
in the company of the meek and fuzzy.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.593
Uh... Mighty Emperor,

14:04.677 --> 14:08.556
I know how anxiously you have awaited
for my repairs to be completed.

14:08.639 --> 14:12.726
Perhaps I can find a way
to expedite your progress.

14:12.810 --> 14:15.688
No need! No need! Work is done.

14:16.146 --> 14:18.816
Finished. Concluded, yes.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.152
-With upgrades!

14:22.653 --> 14:24.697
Ah... Ah!

14:25.197 --> 14:28.826
I'll need a Gelfling.
Perhaps the Drenchen thief.

14:28.909 --> 14:33.163
No, not him. The Drenchen traitor
may yet produce useful information.

14:33.831 --> 14:35.207
Of course.

14:35.332 --> 14:39.253
I will bring you Gelfling,
and you will strap them to your chair.

14:39.336 --> 14:41.672
Just tell me, how many?

14:42.256 --> 14:44.758
How... many?

14:44.842 --> 14:48.220
How many Gelfling must we drain
for us to cheat death

14:48.304 --> 14:50.514
for all eternity?

14:50.723 --> 14:53.601
Emperor, I beg you to reconsider.

14:53.684 --> 14:57.313
The more essence we consume,
the weaker the Crystal grows,

14:57.396 --> 14:59.189
the greater the imbalance,

14:59.273 --> 15:02.443
-the faster the Darkening spreads.
-There is no Darkening!

15:02.526 --> 15:05.279
Yes, yes. Forgive, Emperor.

15:05.446 --> 15:07.573
-Forgive.

15:10.034 --> 15:11.076
So then...

15:13.287 --> 15:14.914
give me a number.

15:15.289 --> 15:16.332
Uh...

15:16.832 --> 15:18.542
A great many.

15:18.959 --> 15:21.462
-A number.

15:22.463 --> 15:23.339
Fifty.

15:23.672 --> 15:25.883
Fifty Gelfling, every trine.

15:28.469 --> 15:29.345
Fifty, then.

15:30.387 --> 15:31.388
So be it.

15:31.722 --> 15:35.643
-Prepare the machine.
-As you wish, my Emperor.

15:39.897 --> 15:42.232
Hush now, hush now.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.151
All is well.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.320
Ungrateful Emperor.

15:46.612 --> 15:50.491
Petty, preening Skeksis
do not appreciate Chamberlain.

15:54.536 --> 15:56.872
-Shoo, Gelfling! Shoo!

16:01.543 --> 16:02.920
Mmm...

16:03.921 --> 16:06.757
I will take seat back at Emperor's side

16:06.840 --> 16:09.593
and teach thick-headed General a lesson!

16:32.116 --> 16:33.158
Oh...

16:36.537 --> 16:38.122
The horn! The horn!

16:38.747 --> 16:41.959
Who has summoned skekMal, the Hunter?

16:42.626 --> 16:45.754
Oh, it's been many a trine
since we last heard the horn.

16:47.548 --> 16:51.677
Oh, nothing good
ever follows its horrid bleating.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.680
Who dares call the Hunter
back to the castle?

16:54.972 --> 16:57.599
Isn't it obvious?
The desperate Chamberlain.

16:57.683 --> 17:02.354
But why, why would Chamberlain risk life
and limb to call upon the Hunter?

17:02.438 --> 17:05.065
To do the job the Chamberlain cannot.

17:05.274 --> 17:06.400
Capture Rian.

17:06.775 --> 17:10.070
But I hope the Hunter
skins the Chamberlain alive first.

17:33.635 --> 17:36.513
You should've seen your face.
You were so scared.

17:36.764 --> 17:39.933
<i>Ne. A apida </i>surprised

17:40.017 --> 17:41.810
to see <i>aminya </i>Deet glowing.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.479
-Hi, you!

17:43.812 --> 17:45.522
Oh, ah...
Mm-mm.

17:46.982 --> 17:47.983
There's a delicious moss

17:48.067 --> 17:51.070
that grows only in Grot
that makes anyone who eats it glow.

17:51.528 --> 17:52.404
<i>Boma</i> strange.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.698
I'd offer you some,
but I used the last of--

17:54.782 --> 17:55.824
-Deet!

17:56.241 --> 17:57.785
- What's wrong?
-Gobbles!

17:57.868 --> 18:00.204
What are gobbles?

18:12.966 --> 18:14.593
<i>Yotubi </i>gobbles.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.261
Thank you, Hup.

18:18.555 --> 18:19.973
- Huh?

18:20.140 --> 18:22.726
Oh... Storm coming.

18:23.769 --> 18:26.396
<i>Chekee </i>shelter. Ha'rar after.

18:26.522 --> 18:27.356
Good idea.

18:27.439 --> 18:28.524
Mm.

18:31.902 --> 18:32.736
So hot!

18:36.949 --> 18:38.283
Too much!

18:39.618 --> 18:41.370
All this walking.<i> </i>

18:42.496 --> 18:43.831
-No!

18:44.164 --> 18:47.084
I will go no further.

18:47.835 --> 18:49.336
-Hm?

18:54.508 --> 18:56.593
I will go a bit further.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.813
Sanctuary Tree.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.043
Oh, Sanctuary Tree.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.755
We have not spoken in a long time.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.507
Nor have <i>we...</i>

19:37.176 --> 19:41.346
-Mother Aughra.
-Archer, old friend.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.182
Why make me walk so far?

19:43.265 --> 19:44.808
To bring you here.

19:44.892 --> 19:48.645
Then you know I do not need trees,
you plodding pile!

19:48.729 --> 19:50.772
-Hm...
-I need to find the Song of Thra!

19:51.315 --> 19:56.195
Ugh... But its tune eludes me.
Has Thra gone quiet?

19:56.278 --> 20:01.241
-No. Thra still sings.
-Then why do I not hear it?

20:01.325 --> 20:06.330
Because you turned your eye away from Thra
and towards the stars.

20:06.413 --> 20:07.873
So many stars.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.792
Goes on and on.

20:11.752 --> 20:13.629
-Like you and I.
-Mm.

20:13.712 --> 20:16.048
On and on.

20:16.131 --> 20:18.675
Yes. Perhaps too long.

20:19.051 --> 20:23.180
We do not get to decide
when our part in the song is finished.

20:23.263 --> 20:26.266
I trusted the Skeksis to look after Thra.

20:26.391 --> 20:29.686
-I took their word!
-And their gifts.

20:30.479 --> 20:33.232
Hm. You speak true, urVa.

20:33.815 --> 20:37.653
But now I have returned from
my cosmic voyage to make things right!

20:37.736 --> 20:41.323
But I cannot guide destiny
if I cannot hear the song.

20:41.448 --> 20:44.368
That is why I am here.

20:45.410 --> 20:46.787
You'll teach it to me?

20:47.371 --> 20:49.081
Oh, no.

20:49.164 --> 20:51.208
Well, if not you, then another Mystic.

20:51.500 --> 20:55.879
The Mystics are hidden safely away
until they are needed.

20:57.422 --> 21:00.592
Hm... They are needed now.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.636
There is one who can help.

21:32.624 --> 21:34.126
Where did you... Archer!

21:35.127 --> 21:39.423
If you cannot show Aughra
the Song of Thra, then who can?

21:42.259 --> 21:43.969
Arrow points to ground.

21:44.052 --> 21:44.928
Hmph!

21:46.805 --> 21:48.265
Arrow points to...

21:49.933 --> 21:50.976
Thra!

21:51.518 --> 21:53.103
Thra will teach!

21:53.312 --> 21:54.187
Hm!

21:54.271 --> 21:57.816
Could've just said this!
Clearly, succinctly...

21:58.817 --> 22:00.652
without all the walking!

22:05.240 --> 22:06.408
Mm...

22:11.330 --> 22:14.041
-Chamberlain!
-Hunter.

22:14.458 --> 22:16.710
What is my prey?

22:16.793 --> 22:19.629
-A Stonewood warrior.
-Gelfling?

22:19.713 --> 22:20.630
Mm...

22:20.714 --> 22:23.300
-You insult me!
-No.

22:23.383 --> 22:26.178
-It is I who has been insulted, yes?

22:26.636 --> 22:30.974
-Look what General has done to my hand.
- Poor skekSil.

22:31.058 --> 22:33.852
Still consumed by petty squabbles.

22:34.311 --> 22:37.856
When will you learn?
Only the hunt matters!

22:39.024 --> 22:40.150
Wait! Wait!

22:40.484 --> 22:43.987
This Gelfling named Rian, he is thief,

22:44.404 --> 22:46.365
fugitive, spy.

22:46.448 --> 22:48.992
Already bested Scientist and myself.

22:49.493 --> 22:53.205
A Gelfling that can stand before Skeksis
and escape with life

22:53.455 --> 22:56.249
is no ordinary prey, yes?

23:00.712 --> 23:02.005
Say more.

23:02.089 --> 23:07.010
He defies us, spreads deceitful slander.

23:07.219 --> 23:10.138
He is threat to all Skeksis.

23:10.597 --> 23:14.559
Such prey would make quite the trophy.
Mm?

23:17.062 --> 23:20.190
-This scrap of Rian's clothing. Good?

23:20.440 --> 23:23.819
I will take his lying tongue!

23:25.112 --> 23:26.279
Mm...

23:44.089 --> 23:44.923
Drenchen!

23:49.553 --> 23:51.805
-Greetings.
-Where's the Chamberlain?

23:52.681 --> 23:54.307
-Ahh!

23:54.808 --> 23:55.642
Occupied.

23:58.937 --> 24:02.649
I will be handling your interrogation
from this point forward.

24:04.568 --> 24:06.528
-Get your... claws off me!
-Quiet!

24:06.987 --> 24:07.904
Move!

24:14.536 --> 24:17.747
- But-- But the Emperor--
- ...put <i>me</i> in charge.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.376
Not good.

24:23.753 --> 24:26.006
Sure.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.009
You should not--

24:29.092 --> 24:31.470
The time has come to find out

24:31.845 --> 24:35.098
if you are a good Gelfling
or a bad Gelfling.

24:35.640 --> 24:39.561
I don't think it matters at this point,
but you could have just asked around!

24:39.644 --> 24:43.690
General, you cannot do this!
You'll kill the Gelfling.

24:43.773 --> 24:45.025
I won't kill him.

24:45.484 --> 24:48.195
I'll just drain the defiance out of him.

24:49.696 --> 24:50.530
Sit.

25:03.084 --> 25:05.253
It's-- It's too dangerous!

25:05.837 --> 25:07.088
Tell me, Drenchen,

25:07.923 --> 25:10.133
where is the fugitive Rian?

25:11.551 --> 25:13.428
Eat sog!

25:17.766 --> 25:18.642
Bad Gelfling!

25:21.811 --> 25:24.981
No! Too much! Too much!

25:42.457 --> 25:44.668
I will ask you once again.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.295
Where is the fugitive Rian?

25:47.379 --> 25:51.049
Have you checked the Great Smerth?
It's particularly lovely in spring.

25:51.132 --> 25:53.343
Bad Gelfling!

26:05.230 --> 26:06.940
-SkekVar!
-Mm!

26:07.023 --> 26:07.857
Enough!

26:08.692 --> 26:10.110
-Oh, uh...

26:17.075 --> 26:19.494
I told the General not to do it.

26:19.953 --> 26:23.039
I was just introducing myself
to the Drenchen.

26:23.123 --> 26:24.249
That can wait.

26:24.332 --> 26:26.668
I have a much more
important task for you, General.

26:26.751 --> 26:27.794
Mm?

26:27.877 --> 26:29.337
Prepare to leave.

26:29.796 --> 26:31.798
You depart for Ha'rar in the morning.

26:32.299 --> 26:33.466
- Oh.
-Huh?

26:45.145 --> 26:46.271
Hm...

26:48.607 --> 26:51.693
Well, Vapra, Stonewood...

26:51.943 --> 26:53.445
Sifa didn't work.

26:54.529 --> 26:57.949
And Stonewood-Drenchen worked once,
but then it didn't.

27:00.869 --> 27:02.454
None of this makes sense.

27:02.829 --> 27:06.458
Mother always said that Vapra
was the highest clan, but...

27:07.083 --> 27:09.919
on two attempts,
the Grottan symbol lit up first,

27:10.754 --> 27:13.882
which is ridiculous because
everyone knows that the Grottan...

27:14.299 --> 27:15.925
are the lowest clan.

27:16.885 --> 27:19.763
At least... that's what we always say.

27:21.181 --> 27:22.182
But...

27:23.141 --> 27:24.517
why do we say that?

27:26.227 --> 27:28.772
Perhaps we're wrong.

27:32.817 --> 27:36.154
"Thra's true balance will be found

27:36.237 --> 27:39.282
when natural order is sound."

27:41.034 --> 27:43.078
Except there is no correct order,

27:43.745 --> 27:47.207
because no clan
is above any of the others.

27:48.625 --> 27:49.626
Ah...

27:50.877 --> 27:52.212
It isn't a puzzle.

27:54.673 --> 27:55.882
It's a lie.

28:32.877 --> 28:33.962
That's it.

28:34.546 --> 28:35.880
We're all one!

28:37.257 --> 28:38.133
Huh?

29:01.239 --> 29:02.615
-Uh...

29:08.621 --> 29:09.539
Uh...

29:12.542 --> 29:13.376
Hello.

29:14.461 --> 29:16.463
Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry.

29:17.046 --> 29:19.883
I didn't mean to frighten you. I...

29:35.482 --> 29:37.901
What are you doing? That's close enough.

29:39.986 --> 29:40.820
Wait!

29:46.743 --> 29:48.787
<i>Be not afraid.</i>

29:48.870 --> 29:50.955
<i>This creature is Lore.</i>

29:51.498 --> 29:56.127
<i>And while he may seem threatening,</i>
<i>you are perfectly safe.</i>

29:59.798 --> 30:01.466
-Hello, Lore.

30:01.925 --> 30:03.092
My name is Brea.

30:05.887 --> 30:09.682
<i>Now, Lore will guide you</i>
<i>to the answers you seek.</i>

30:17.816 --> 30:18.817
Hm?

30:28.201 --> 30:29.828
<i>So travel swift.</i>

30:42.257 --> 30:43.842
<i>...with each passing trine,</i>

30:43.925 --> 30:47.136
<i>they tighten their grip</i>
<i>upon the Gelfling of Thra.</i>

30:47.220 --> 30:49.556
<i>I'm sure you have many questions.</i>

30:50.640 --> 30:53.476
-I always have questions.
<i>-Lore has imprinted on you.</i>

30:53.560 --> 30:56.271
<i>He is now your guardian</i>
<i>and will protect you</i>

30:56.354 --> 30:59.649
<i>on your journey to the Circle of the Suns.</i>

30:59.732 --> 31:04.362
<i>There you will find the key to freeing</i>
<i>Gelfling from Skeksis power forever.</i>

31:06.030 --> 31:06.865
What's wrong?

31:08.366 --> 31:09.534
Get away from it, Brea!

31:09.701 --> 31:12.328
-You don't understand!
-I understand it speaks heresy.

31:12.412 --> 31:14.497
No! No! Wait!

31:14.831 --> 31:16.040
Lore, stop!

31:16.708 --> 31:17.750
It's all right.

31:18.251 --> 31:19.460
She's my sister.

31:22.088 --> 31:24.799
She's my sister. It's all right.

31:27.093 --> 31:29.220
Yes. That's good.

31:35.310 --> 31:36.185
Brea...

31:37.353 --> 31:39.022
What have you done?

31:45.111 --> 31:46.946
Just great.

32:16.517 --> 32:18.227
Excuse me. Pardon.

33:32.593 --> 33:33.845
Dance <i>bowbi! </i>

33:33.928 --> 33:36.431
I'm sorry. I'm not much of a dancer.

33:36.556 --> 33:38.433
Thank you. Maybe later.

34:00.580 --> 34:03.082
But... But I didn't order this.

34:03.958 --> 34:04.917
Lady.

34:05.293 --> 34:07.587
-Lady.

34:08.129 --> 34:09.255
-Oh...

34:09.380 --> 34:10.256
I see.

34:11.424 --> 34:12.383
Thank you!

34:26.439 --> 34:28.483
Sorry, I don't want to dan--

34:28.566 --> 34:30.693
Don't move. Hands on the table.

34:31.027 --> 34:32.779
-You're...
-Naia.

34:33.112 --> 34:35.114
-Gurjin's sister.
-And this is Kylan.

34:35.615 --> 34:38.993
-We're not here for a fight.
-But you are coming with us, traitor.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.578
-I'm no traitor.
- I don't care.

34:40.661 --> 34:44.165
The Skeksis want you, and I want
my brother, so I'm going to make a trade.

34:51.339 --> 34:54.467
-I'll take it from here, Drenchen.
-You're not taking anything, Vapran.

34:54.967 --> 34:56.886
I am the Princess Tavra...

34:56.969 --> 34:58.554
-sent by the All-Maudra...
-And I'm the eldest daughter...

34:58.638 --> 35:01.099
-...to return this criminal to Ha'rar--
-...of Maudra Laesid, sister of...

35:01.182 --> 35:03.935
Perhaps we should all take
a deep calming breath.

35:04.936 --> 35:07.146
-Rian murdered a member of my clan!
-I didn't!

35:07.230 --> 35:09.148
He's going to the Crystal Castle with me!

35:09.232 --> 35:11.818
You're in over your head.
Go back to your swamp.

35:11.901 --> 35:14.028
-That's enough!

35:23.204 --> 35:24.580
What is that?

35:24.664 --> 35:26.791
Dreamfast with me, and I'll show you.

35:26.874 --> 35:29.377
Everyone knows your mind is infected.

35:29.585 --> 35:31.879
We dreamfast, we take in your sickness.

35:31.963 --> 35:35.925
The Skeksis spread the lie that I am sick
to ensure the truth dies with me.

35:38.553 --> 35:40.429
The truth about your brother.

35:41.639 --> 35:43.516
And what happened to Mira.

35:44.517 --> 35:47.186
-I'll dreamfast with you.
-Kylan, no.

35:47.270 --> 35:51.065
The Skeksis may rule the land,<i></i>
but they do not rule my heart.

35:51.149 --> 35:53.818
My mother would want to know
the whole truth.

35:54.944 --> 35:55.862
Huh.

35:57.697 --> 35:58.781
What's the matter?

35:59.615 --> 36:00.575
Scared?

36:02.785 --> 36:03.953
If I come out of this crazy,

36:04.036 --> 36:07.290
the last thing I'll do before
I lose my mind is take your life.

36:08.875 --> 36:10.042
Sounds fair.

36:41.574 --> 36:43.242
<i> </i>You want to go Spitter hunting?

36:43.326 --> 36:46.829
...my father had to listen
to a few stories about his son.

37:14.982 --> 37:15.983
Rian!

37:17.610 --> 37:18.611
Don't let it escape!

37:21.864 --> 37:24.200
-What's down there?
<i>-</i> <i>Let's see.</i>

37:24.700 --> 37:26.577
Do you know what this is?

37:26.661 --> 37:28.537
It's the Crystal of Truth.

37:28.621 --> 37:30.456
- <i>Here is the answer we seek!</i>

37:43.219 --> 37:46.389
- <i>We are friends, Rian!</i>
-No, don't listen, Rian.

37:48.182 --> 37:50.142
- Rian! Run, Rian!

37:51.102 --> 37:52.561
You'll never catch Rian now.

37:57.441 --> 37:58.567
Gurjin!

38:08.286 --> 38:10.121
Rian, I was...

38:10.496 --> 38:12.248
-Did you see?
-Yes.

38:13.040 --> 38:14.041
Everything.

38:14.750 --> 38:16.627
I'm sorry I didn't believe you, son.

38:18.963 --> 38:22.383
We're together now,
that's all that matters.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.184
Look.

38:33.227 --> 38:34.979
-Look!
- The table!

38:43.487 --> 38:45.448
We created a dream etching.

38:46.782 --> 38:49.493
I know this symbol.
My sister showed it to me.

38:51.537 --> 38:52.705
We are all in danger.

38:53.122 --> 38:56.292
We must go to the All-Maudra,
rally every Gelfling to our cause.

38:57.084 --> 39:00.212
My brother is still a prisoner.
I will go and free him.

39:00.296 --> 39:01.630
And I will go with you.

39:02.006 --> 39:04.717
A Vapran and a Drenchen
fighting side by side.

39:05.176 --> 39:09.805
-Hm. It really must be end times.
-Well, then we'd better act quickly.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.016
-Hm.
-Hm.

39:12.266 --> 39:13.768
We'll meet you in Ha'rar!

39:14.685 --> 39:17.521
-Until the day.
-Thra protect us all.

39:18.064 --> 39:19.023
Hm.

39:20.608 --> 39:22.193
-We have to keep moving!

39:22.276 --> 39:25.821
Once the Skeksis realize
I've betrayed them, they'll send others.

39:26.781 --> 39:29.241
Any guards they send
will have to believe you!

39:29.325 --> 39:30.534
I can dreamfast.

39:31.410 --> 39:32.912
They won't send Gelfling.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.623
The Skeksis will come for us!

39:35.706 --> 39:37.625
Come on, son! This way!

39:53.224 --> 39:57.186
The Skeksis will stop at nothing
to keep their secrets.

40:01.732 --> 40:03.359
Run, Rian! Go! Run!

40:33.597 --> 40:34.723
Huh?

40:35.182 --> 40:36.267
That was Rian!

40:39.979 --> 40:43.649
<i>Aduma!</i> Beast! Retreat <i>ya elambom!</i>

40:44.108 --> 40:45.526
He needs our help!

40:46.360 --> 40:47.361
- Deet!

40:48.070 --> 40:49.864
Deet!

40:53.951 --> 40:55.744
-I think we lost it.
-Not for long.

40:55.828 --> 40:56.662
Huh?

40:56.745 --> 40:57.746
We need a plan.

41:00.040 --> 41:03.252
Do you remember when we used to catch
Fizzgig outside Stone-in-the-Wood?

41:03.794 --> 41:04.837
Ah...

41:05.171 --> 41:07.214
Just like old times.

41:10.050 --> 41:10.968
I'll be the bait.

41:12.052 --> 41:13.387
See you soon.

42:18.869 --> 42:21.247
I've come for my prize!

42:21.330 --> 42:23.290
Your lying tongue!

43:03.998 --> 43:05.749
Not quite like old times.

43:06.500 --> 43:08.210
Very well

43:08.294 --> 43:09.920
Father and son.

43:10.129 --> 43:11.672
-Not quite.

43:11.797 --> 43:12.756
Together!

43:15.634 --> 43:16.927
Oh! Rian!

43:33.902 --> 43:35.487
You have heart.

43:37.990 --> 43:40.326
I'll take that, too.

43:51.128 --> 43:52.129
Follow me!

43:56.800 --> 43:58.886
-Father?

44:00.137 --> 44:01.180
Father!

44:01.889 --> 44:03.390
Enough fun!

44:07.353 --> 44:09.355
-No! Father!
-Not...

44:10.022 --> 44:10.939
my...

44:11.023 --> 44:13.025
son!

44:21.617 --> 44:22.576
No!

44:23.077 --> 44:26.080
-Father!
-You're coming with me.

44:26.747 --> 44:28.666
It's all right.

44:30.542 --> 44:33.003
Rian, be brave!

44:38.759 --> 44:39.593
No!

44:46.350 --> 44:50.270
No! Father! Father!

44:50.562 --> 44:53.565
- Rian, stop! It's too dangerous!
-No, Father!

44:54.191 --> 44:56.944
No! No! No!

44:58.278 --> 44:59.196
No!

45:00.197 --> 45:01.323
He's gone.

45:02.574 --> 45:03.701
He's gone.

45:07.079 --> 45:09.081
They're all... gone.

45:26.432 --> 45:29.351
No! No!

45:29.685 --> 45:30.894
Rian!
