00:01.302 --> 00:01.469
.

00:01.502 --> 00:02.403
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:04.105 --> 00:05.506
sexually based offenses

00:05.539 --> 00:07.341
are considered
especially heinous.

00:07.375 --> 00:09.110
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.143 --> 00:10.778
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.811 --> 00:12.380
are members of an elite squad

00:12.413 --> 00:14.248
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.282 --> 00:16.284
These are their stories.

00:23.557 --> 00:26.026
[laughter]

00:33.534 --> 00:37.538
- Okay, um, this isn't--
this isn't what we want.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.407
Why don't we just
wait here for a second?

00:39.440 --> 00:41.375
We'll let everyone catch up.

00:41.409 --> 00:44.445
[cell phone chiming]

00:46.547 --> 00:50.218
- Are your parents texting you?
- No, Lydia.

00:50.251 --> 00:51.452
- Lydia Banks?

00:51.485 --> 00:53.221
- Yeah. I haven't seen her

00:53.254 --> 00:54.555
since she moved to New York.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.524
She said she'd
meet us right here.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.226
- Ann!

00:58.259 --> 00:59.560
- There she is! Lydia!

00:59.593 --> 01:04.498
- Oh, my God!

01:04.532 --> 01:06.367
Hey, stranger.
Welcome to New York.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.136
- Oh, the city is so big.

01:08.169 --> 01:09.637
I didn't think you'd find me.

01:09.670 --> 01:11.239
- Wow.

01:11.272 --> 01:12.473
- Oh, you remember Lucas.

01:12.506 --> 01:15.876
- Of course. Hey.
- Hey, Lydia.

01:15.909 --> 01:21.115
- So, where to?

01:21.149 --> 01:22.450
Oh, my God.
That bartender keeps trying

01:22.483 --> 01:24.252
to sell me shots.

01:24.285 --> 01:25.519
- He shouldn't be doing that.
I'm gonna go

01:25.553 --> 01:27.421
say something to him.

01:27.455 --> 01:28.489
- How chivalrous.

01:28.522 --> 01:30.558
- [laughs]

01:30.591 --> 01:32.360
Lucas is great.

01:32.393 --> 01:34.862
He was the only person
I could talk to when you left.

01:34.895 --> 01:38.299
- So question:
what are you guys?

01:38.332 --> 01:39.600
- Excuse me?

01:39.633 --> 01:40.601
- Well, are you
high school debate

01:40.634 --> 01:41.869
or are you model U.N.?

01:41.902 --> 01:43.471
We have a little bet going on.

01:43.504 --> 01:45.439
- Neither. She lives here.
I'm visiting,

01:45.473 --> 01:47.208
doing volunteer work
with my church.

01:47.241 --> 01:49.443
- Wow. A church chick.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.612
That is so nice.
So you must be a virgin, then.

01:51.645 --> 01:57.251
- [scoffs] With a line
like that, you definitely are.

01:57.285 --> 01:59.587
We're not interested.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.722
- Swing and a miss.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.260
[both laughing]
- Jeez.

02:06.294 --> 02:07.628
- I forgot how much
I missed you.

02:07.661 --> 02:10.464
- Ann, were those guys
bothering you?

02:10.498 --> 02:13.601
- Uh, Lydia got rid of them.

02:13.634 --> 02:16.337
- Well. I see.

02:16.370 --> 02:19.473
Thank you, Lydia.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.141
- My pleasure.

02:27.215 --> 02:29.250
- Oh. Hi, Charlotte.
- It's 11:00.

02:29.283 --> 02:31.385
Time for lights out.

02:31.419 --> 02:34.222
- Hey.
- You know the rules.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.723
No guests in the room.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.391
- It was my fault; I just needed
to use the bathroom.

02:37.425 --> 02:40.661
But I'm leaving.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.430
- I'm sorry.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.170
Bye.
- Bye, Ann.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.208
- Lights out.

02:54.242 --> 02:56.210
[phone chiming]

03:00.381 --> 03:03.217
- [laughs]

03:03.251 --> 03:04.785
[knock at door]

03:11.625 --> 03:13.627
I just turned
the lights out, Charlotte.

03:13.661 --> 03:15.563
I'm getting into--

03:32.045 --> 03:34.248
- [laughs]

03:34.282 --> 03:35.616
I'm back.

03:35.649 --> 03:38.719
Charlotte has to be asleep by--

03:38.752 --> 03:40.488
Ann?

03:42.623 --> 03:43.757
Ann, what's wrong?

03:46.827 --> 03:48.829
- Vic's name is Ann Davenport.

03:48.862 --> 03:52.700
18, part of a visiting church
group from Hunter, Indiana.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.603
- And she said that she was
sexually assaulted in her room.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.471
- No, actually,
her friend said that.

03:57.505 --> 03:59.340
Lydia Banks, also 18.

03:59.373 --> 04:00.674
She's the one who called 911.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.343
- Okay, we're gonna need
security footage

04:02.376 --> 04:03.644
from the hallway
and the elevator.

04:03.677 --> 04:06.480
Key card entry logs.
The works.

04:06.514 --> 04:08.416
- Hi.
- Hey, are you from SVU?

04:08.449 --> 04:09.617
- I am.
I'm Lieutenant Benson.

04:09.650 --> 04:10.851
This is Detective Tutuola.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.720
- You Lydia?
- Yeah.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.755
- Uh, Lydia, I need to
speak with Ann alone

04:14.788 --> 04:16.490
for a moment, okay?

04:16.524 --> 04:20.294
Thank you so much.

04:20.328 --> 04:23.664
So Ann, can you tell me
what happened?

04:23.697 --> 04:25.633
- I'm--I'm not really sure.

04:25.666 --> 04:29.803
- You were raped!

04:29.837 --> 04:31.572
Look, she was raped.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.541
She would never let a man
have sex with her.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.376
She is--

04:35.409 --> 04:37.478
She is a lesbian.

04:41.849 --> 04:43.751
- [sighs]

04:44.818 --> 04:47.788
[dramatic music]

04:47.821 --> 04:54.862
*

05:31.098 --> 05:33.133
- Look, I don't know what Ann
has been telling you,

05:33.166 --> 05:35.736
but the church
has brainwashed her.

05:35.769 --> 05:38.372
I mean, they've convinced her
that being gay is a sin.

05:38.406 --> 05:40.908
- How do you two
know each other?

05:40.941 --> 05:42.543
- Well, we grew up together.

05:42.576 --> 05:46.614
I got out of Indiana
when I turned 16.

05:46.647 --> 05:48.649
We did stay in touch,
but tonight's the first time

05:48.682 --> 05:50.384
I've seen her
since I moved to New York.

05:50.418 --> 05:52.753
- Okay. So what'd you guys
do tonight?

05:52.786 --> 05:54.021
- Well, we had a drink.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.156
It was just a soda at the bar.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.158
Um--

05:58.191 --> 05:59.527
And then we went back
to her room.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.161
Um--

06:01.194 --> 06:03.130
And then the chaperone
knocked on the door,

06:03.163 --> 06:05.165
said it was 11:00;
it's lights out.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.535
And then Ann,
she snuck me her room key

06:07.568 --> 06:10.671
so that I could come back
and we could--we could hang out.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.105
- How much later?

06:12.139 --> 06:14.575
- It was, like,
maybe a half hour later.

06:14.608 --> 06:15.943
And, you know, I thought
everyone would be asleep,

06:15.976 --> 06:19.547
so I went in and Ann was crying.

06:19.580 --> 06:22.416
And she said
that she had been raped.

06:22.450 --> 06:23.651
- She used that word?

06:23.684 --> 06:25.753
- Basically.
I mean, she said,

06:25.786 --> 06:30.724
"He made me.
My virtue is gone."

06:30.758 --> 06:33.026
What does that
sound like to you?

06:33.060 --> 06:36.196
- A few minutes later,
I heard a knock at the door.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.598
And I thought
it was Charlotte again,

06:37.631 --> 06:38.799
but it wasn't.

06:38.832 --> 06:41.702
- Okay. Do you know who it was?

06:41.735 --> 06:45.005
- Uh, just a guy.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.975
- Okay. Was it somebody
that you recognized?

06:48.008 --> 06:51.745
- Uhh, it was just dark
and I can't--

06:51.779 --> 06:54.482
I can't say.

06:54.515 --> 06:57.685
- Okay. So, Ann, did he--
did he threaten you

06:57.718 --> 06:58.986
or did he have a weapon?

06:59.019 --> 07:01.589
- No, he told me--

07:01.622 --> 07:03.724
He told me to lie down
on the bed.

07:03.757 --> 07:07.528
I didn't want to.
And then--

07:07.561 --> 07:10.498
But--but I thought I had to.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.032
- It's okay.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.237
Can you tell me
what happened next?

07:17.270 --> 07:22.142
- He--he pulled my skirt up.

07:22.175 --> 07:24.211
And I said, "No."

07:24.244 --> 07:26.079
And then I tried
to fight him off

07:26.113 --> 07:27.848
and then he--

07:27.881 --> 07:30.584
He had--he had sex
with me anyway.

07:30.618 --> 07:34.121
And--[sighs]

07:34.154 --> 07:37.090
I would never have sex
with a boy.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.527
- Because you're a lesbian.
- No.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.762
No, I'm saving myself
for marriage.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.732
I'm a virgin.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.600
Or I was.
- Okay, so what

07:46.634 --> 07:49.136
Lydia said before--
- I'm not.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.638
I mean, I have feelings
for Lydia,

07:50.671 --> 07:51.805
but I would never act on them.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.807
That's a--that's a sin.

07:53.841 --> 07:58.045
- [sighs] Honey, I need you
to listen to me.

07:58.078 --> 08:02.883
If you didn't want to have sex
with that boy,

08:02.916 --> 08:06.186
that's rape.

08:06.219 --> 08:08.522
So--

08:08.556 --> 08:10.057
So I'd like to take you
to the hospital,

08:10.090 --> 08:12.159
where you can be examined, okay?

08:19.600 --> 08:22.169
- So Ann can't tell us who
attacked her or she won't?

08:22.202 --> 08:23.737
- Well, it's obvious
she's traumatized.

08:23.771 --> 08:25.238
It's possible that
the perp threatened her.

08:25.272 --> 08:26.707
- Or she had sex
with a boyfriend

08:26.740 --> 08:29.076
and don't want
her girlfriend to know.

08:29.109 --> 08:31.078
- I'm not getting that.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.880
- Lieutenant Benson?
- Yes.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.214
- I'm Reverend Gary Langham.

08:34.247 --> 08:36.584
Ann is one of my congregants.

08:36.617 --> 08:38.085
- Let me make this call.
- Yeah.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.887
Uh, yes, Reverend.
Ann mentioned you.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.221
- We're worried sick about her.

08:41.254 --> 08:42.723
She was sexually assaulted?

08:42.756 --> 08:44.692
Did she say by who?
- No, not yet.

08:44.725 --> 08:47.695
She's actually quite hesitant
to tell us what happened.

08:47.728 --> 08:50.263
- I can understand that.
She's very sheltered.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.232
- Is it possible
that Ann is involved

08:52.265 --> 08:53.601
with somebody in the group?

08:53.634 --> 08:55.202
Or that she has a boyfriend

08:55.235 --> 08:57.204
here in New York?
- Absolutely not.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.740
Ann is chaste.
All of our congregants are.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.609
We don't believe
in premarital sex.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.110
- I understand.
I just had to ask.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.145
- I blame myself for this.

09:05.178 --> 09:06.647
I never should have
brought her to New York.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.682
She's--she's naive.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.718
She's trusting.

09:10.751 --> 09:13.120
She was obviously taken
advantage of by someone.

09:13.153 --> 09:16.624
- But you didn't see any--
anyone in particular?

09:16.657 --> 09:18.859
- Now that you mention it,
there were these two boys.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.360
They were drunk.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.862
They were obnoxious.

09:21.895 --> 09:25.232
One was wearing an orange
Shark Wear hat.

09:25.265 --> 09:26.867
- Okay, that could
be very helpful.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.670
[cell phone buzzes]

09:29.703 --> 09:30.938
- This is Ann's parents.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.273
They're getting on
a flight here now.

09:33.306 --> 09:34.742
It's not the best light
to see New York in

09:34.775 --> 09:36.977
for the first time.
- No.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.812
If you think of anything else,

09:38.846 --> 09:40.881
would you be so kind
to give me a call?

09:40.914 --> 09:41.882
- I will thank you.
- All right.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.618
Thank you, Reverend.

09:44.652 --> 09:47.621
- Reverend, huh?
What'd he have to say?

09:47.655 --> 09:49.890
- That they're not
in Kansas anymore.

09:51.859 --> 09:55.328
- NYPD.
Open up.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.297
- Morning, sunshine.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.932
Know why we're here?

09:58.966 --> 10:00.768
- Uh, did the bartender
call you?

10:00.801 --> 10:02.235
Our IDs weren't fake, I swear.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.370
- No, forget about
the bartender.

10:03.403 --> 10:04.638
Do you recognize this girl?

10:04.672 --> 10:08.208
Hey, wake up.

10:08.241 --> 10:10.811
- No. No, I don't think so.
- What about you? Huh?

10:10.844 --> 10:12.913
Maybe from the bar?
- Uh, oh--oh, yeah.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.782
It's the church chick.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.717
- Yeah, the church chick
got assaulted last night.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.986
- Whoa, whoa. We didn't have
anything to do with that.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.387
Her friend shut us down.
We bounced.

10:20.420 --> 10:21.922
- You bounced, huh?
- Yeah.

10:21.955 --> 10:22.923
- Where'd you go
after you left the bar?

10:22.956 --> 10:24.725
- We crashed.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.393
We saw Billy Joel
at the Garden.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.662
And then we missed
the last train to Massapequa,

10:28.696 --> 10:30.831
so I used my dad's credit card
and I got this room.

10:30.864 --> 10:32.332
- Okay, you didn't
follow her up here?

10:32.365 --> 10:34.001
Try to turn a no into a yes?
- No, no.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.803
Her boyfriend
was hanging around.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.337
Didn't want any part of that.
- Her boyfriend,

10:37.370 --> 10:38.672
what'd he look like?
- Ask the bartender.

10:38.706 --> 10:39.740
He was yelling at him.

10:39.773 --> 10:42.342
Something about shots.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.411
I don't get what they were even
doing at a bar anyway.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.749
- This guy jumped
down my throat.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.017
You know, I didn't know
these girls were underage.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.785
- Isn't knowing that
part of your job?

10:51.819 --> 10:53.353
- I was upselling.
They were ordering sodas,

10:53.386 --> 10:54.688
not tipping.

10:54.722 --> 10:55.989
You know, I gotta eat, too.

10:56.023 --> 10:57.725
- All right, all right.
That's fine.

10:57.758 --> 10:58.992
And what'd this guy look like?

10:59.026 --> 11:01.294
- Clean cut. Tall.
Brown hair.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.063
He was polite
for being so pissed off.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.465
- Is that the best you can do?
- He ran out of cash.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.234
I had to charge a smoothie
he ordered to his room.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.737
- You got the room number?

11:09.770 --> 11:11.805
- Ann's not my girlfriend.
She's just my friend.

11:11.839 --> 11:14.374
We go to church together.
Is she okay?

11:14.407 --> 11:16.243
- You two were at the bar
together last night?

11:16.276 --> 11:18.445
- Yeah. And her friend, Lydia.
- Did you notice

11:18.478 --> 11:20.380
anybody following her, maybe?

11:20.413 --> 11:22.816
Or, um, I don't know,
was Ann flirting with anyone?

11:22.850 --> 11:25.919
- No. Ann doesn't flirt.
What is this about?

11:25.953 --> 11:29.489
- She was assaulted last night
in her room.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.258
- What?

11:31.291 --> 11:32.893
She said she was assaulted?

11:32.926 --> 11:35.428
That's--is that
the word she used?

11:35.462 --> 11:38.966
- No. That's what happened.

11:38.999 --> 11:41.468
- [chuckles] It's not.
- She was raped.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.070
We're trying to figure out
who might have done something

11:43.103 --> 11:44.504
like this to her.
- No.

11:44.537 --> 11:45.806
She wasn't raped.

11:45.839 --> 11:49.109
I would never rape anyone.

11:49.142 --> 11:50.878
- What are you talking about?

11:50.911 --> 11:55.015
- It wasn't rape.
It was curative intercourse.

12:08.829 --> 12:08.996
.

12:09.029 --> 12:09.662
- [sighs]
Lucas is my friend.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.133
He was doing what
he thought was right.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.068
That's why I couldn't tell you
it was him.

12:15.102 --> 12:17.537
- Yeah, we understand.
- He told us what he did to you

12:17.570 --> 12:20.340
was--was curative intercourse.

12:20.373 --> 12:24.878
- Yes. To cure me of
my attraction to Lydia.

12:24.912 --> 12:27.014
Homosexuality is a sin.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.916
- I was following God's command.

12:28.949 --> 12:33.253
- Really? Okay, but Ann told us
that she didn't consent,

12:33.286 --> 12:35.823
that she--she didn't
wanna have sex.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.390
- No, she--she wanted to.

12:37.424 --> 12:40.260
- She told you this?
- She didn't have to.

12:40.293 --> 12:44.031
I know she didn't wanna
be a homosexual.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.298
No one does.

12:45.332 --> 12:48.001
- You told us that
you were a virgin.

12:48.035 --> 12:52.239
So isn't what he did to you
also a sin?

12:52.272 --> 12:54.374
- Fornication can be forgiven.

12:54.407 --> 12:59.179
It's a small price to pay for
the graver sin of homosexuality.

12:59.212 --> 13:01.348
He--he was saving me.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.951
- Well, she told us
she didn't want you in there

13:03.984 --> 13:06.119
and that she said no.
- Even if she did,

13:06.153 --> 13:09.089
it--it wouldn't have mattered.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.091
- Why's that?

13:11.124 --> 13:14.862
- Because we're taught not to
heed the words of the devil.

13:14.895 --> 13:17.197
- Whatever was in his mind,

13:17.230 --> 13:19.032
if you didn't want him
to do that--

13:19.066 --> 13:21.869
if you didn't give him consent--

13:21.902 --> 13:23.837
that's rape.
- Mm-mm.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.105
That may be what you believe--

13:25.138 --> 13:26.339
- No, it's what I know, honey.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.275
That's--that's the law.

13:31.178 --> 13:34.414
- But it's not God's law.

13:34.447 --> 13:36.083
- It's not rape.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.852
It's not done with hate
or anger.

13:38.886 --> 13:40.253
It's done with love.

13:40.287 --> 13:43.223
The world is filled
with temptations,

13:43.256 --> 13:45.092
but when a woman feels
the full glory

13:45.125 --> 13:46.894
of God inside her,

13:46.927 --> 13:48.128
she sees the true path.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.297
- The full glory, huh?

13:50.330 --> 13:53.366
- Being one with a man,
as God intended.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.435
When a woman feels that,

13:55.468 --> 13:57.104
she's brought back
to God's will.

13:57.137 --> 13:59.239
And understands her role.

13:59.272 --> 14:01.875
Ann needed to be saved.

14:04.111 --> 14:07.180
- Liv?
- Yeah. Excuse me, Ann.

14:09.282 --> 14:12.886
- So, um, this kid
is basically confessing.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.487
But in his mind, he forced Ann
to have sex with him

14:14.521 --> 14:16.990
to save her from going to hell.
- Okay. Keep him talking.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.092
- All right.
Also, Ann's parents are here.

14:19.126 --> 14:20.660
- [sighs]

14:20.693 --> 14:22.495
- I wanna see my daughter.
- And you will.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.364
She's just speaking
with our lieutenant right now.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.133
- She shouldn't have
come on this trip.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.368
She was assaulted.
- Who did this to her?

14:28.401 --> 14:30.037
Have you made an arrest?

14:30.070 --> 14:31.671
- Well, we're still
investigating.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.306
- I don't understand.
I mean, how did this happen?

14:33.340 --> 14:35.142
Was it someone at the hotel?

14:35.175 --> 14:36.409
- We actually don't think
it was a stranger.

14:36.443 --> 14:39.079
Do you--do you guys
know Lucas Hull?

14:39.112 --> 14:40.513
- Yes.
- Can you describe

14:40.547 --> 14:42.382
his relationship
with your daughter?

14:42.415 --> 14:45.018
- What do you mean?

14:45.052 --> 14:48.155
- Paul. This must have something
to do with Lydia Banks.

14:48.188 --> 14:49.923
- Excuse me?

14:49.957 --> 14:53.693
- Lydia. She tried to
lead Ann astray.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.063
- Okay, 'cause Ann said
she was her friend.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.498
- [sighs]
She's a lesbian.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.236
We're taking our daughter home.

15:03.270 --> 15:05.038
We need to
deal with this our way.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.040
- I understand that, sir.
But we are in the middle

15:07.074 --> 15:09.142
of a criminal investigation
and we would

15:09.176 --> 15:11.344
very much appreciate
your cooperation.

15:11.378 --> 15:13.180
- It's the police, Paul.

15:13.213 --> 15:14.447
She needs to stay, right?

15:14.481 --> 15:16.316
- Yes, that would be helpful.

15:16.349 --> 15:18.118
- I'm just worried about Ann.

15:18.151 --> 15:20.387
Regardless of why this happened,
she was traumatized.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.289
I wanna make sure she's safe.
- So do we.

15:22.322 --> 15:25.458
- Look, we have
had enough of this.

15:25.492 --> 15:29.096
We'll be at the hotel.

15:29.129 --> 15:30.397
- What's gonna happen to Lucas?

15:30.430 --> 15:32.199
- He committed a crime, Ann.

15:32.232 --> 15:35.068
We can't just pretend
it never happened.

15:35.102 --> 15:38.338
- Reverend, the police
are saying that Ann has--

15:38.371 --> 15:40.207
- I know. Just take Ann
back to the hotel.

15:40.240 --> 15:43.076
Let me handle the police.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.411
Lieutenant Benson,
I've retained

15:44.444 --> 15:46.379
a New York City attorney
for Lucas Hull.

15:46.413 --> 15:48.481
- And my client's interview
is over.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.085
- Lucas has a right to counsel,

15:52.119 --> 15:54.321
but he's already confessed
to my detectives.

15:54.354 --> 15:56.423
- There is nothing
to confess to.

15:56.456 --> 15:59.126
- Excuse me?
- Lucas had curative intercourse

15:59.159 --> 16:00.560
with Ann Davenport.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.229
It's his right,
under the First Amendment.

16:02.262 --> 16:03.496
- His right?
- It's an expression

16:03.530 --> 16:05.999
of his and Ann's
religious beliefs.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.567
- Okay.
- Look, I'm no preacher,

16:07.600 --> 16:09.469
but I know the guy in the sky
isn't down with rape.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.104
- Yeah, well, neither is
the State of New York.

16:11.138 --> 16:14.274
And regardless of
his religious beliefs,

16:14.307 --> 16:16.443
Lucas is guilty
of sexual assault.

16:16.476 --> 16:19.279
So he won't be going anywhere.

16:19.312 --> 16:22.049
- Well, then,
I will see you in court.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.287
- His pastor's invoking
the First Amendment?

16:27.320 --> 16:28.788
- He claims he was trying
to cure her

16:28.821 --> 16:30.590
and the victim does, too.
- The victim?

16:30.623 --> 16:33.193
- Yeah, she admits
that she was raped,

16:33.226 --> 16:35.062
but doesn't wanna press charges
because she thinks

16:35.095 --> 16:36.396
the guy did it
for the right reasons.

16:36.429 --> 16:39.066
- None of that matters.
Ann didn't consent.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.533
It was rape.
- Right, but if she really

16:40.567 --> 16:42.402
believes that what he did
was curative--

16:42.435 --> 16:44.304
- Even if you buy into
this demented doctrine,

16:44.337 --> 16:46.106
a patient has the right
to refuse care at any time.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.274
- Of course,
but I'm just saying

16:47.307 --> 16:48.541
that given her
religious beliefs,

16:48.575 --> 16:50.043
all right,
it's more than possible

16:50.077 --> 16:51.311
that this kid's defense attorney

16:51.344 --> 16:52.812
is gonna lather that up
into consent.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.215
- Yeah, I agree.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.484
So we've gotta help Ann
see the light, so to speak.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.286
- And how do we do that?

16:59.319 --> 17:01.088
- Use your imagination.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.555
Religion has been used to
justify everything

17:02.589 --> 17:04.624
from genocide
to the war against Christmas.

17:04.657 --> 17:07.394
I'm sure we can twist it
in our favor, for once.

17:07.427 --> 17:09.262
Just get her on our side.

17:15.202 --> 17:18.438
- Hey.
- There you are. Hi.

17:18.471 --> 17:19.672
- My mother thinks I'm napping.

17:19.706 --> 17:22.542
She's afraid I'll go see Lydia.

17:22.575 --> 17:25.178
- Oh. Do you wanna see Lydia?

17:25.212 --> 17:28.115
- Uh, Lydia's a good person,

17:28.148 --> 17:32.185
even if she's, uh--

17:32.219 --> 17:34.554
- Homosexual?

17:34.587 --> 17:38.591
- [sighs]
- You're a good person too, Ann.

17:38.625 --> 17:41.528
- I--I try to put all this

17:41.561 --> 17:45.298
in God's hands, to have faith.

17:45.332 --> 17:48.568
But God's law and man's law
say two different things.

17:48.601 --> 17:51.371
And how do I know what's right?

17:51.404 --> 17:53.206
- Maybe you don't need to know.

17:53.240 --> 17:57.244
Maybe--maybe you just need
to tell the truth.

17:57.277 --> 17:58.545
- The truth.

17:58.578 --> 18:01.114
That--that I have feelings
for Lydia

18:01.148 --> 18:03.350
or what Lucas did?

18:03.383 --> 18:05.118
- Both.

18:05.152 --> 18:06.686
- But my lust is a sin.

18:06.719 --> 18:09.422
It's--

18:09.456 --> 18:14.561
- Ann, God made you
the way you are.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.363
What Lucas did,
do you really think

18:16.396 --> 18:19.299
that God would condone that?

18:19.332 --> 18:20.633
He hurt you.

18:20.667 --> 18:25.472
- Ah--
[sighs]

18:25.505 --> 18:28.408
- You know,
I believe in God, too.

18:32.245 --> 18:38.218
And I'm not sure what He has
in store for me or for you.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.320
Or for anyone, for that matter.

18:40.353 --> 18:44.457
But--but what I am sure about

18:44.491 --> 18:48.361
regardless of religion,

18:48.395 --> 18:52.932
is that what Lucas
did to you was wrong.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.734
- [crying]

19:14.921 --> 19:15.955
- Lucas Hull, on the charge of
rape in the fist degree,

19:17.957 --> 19:20.527
how do you plead?
- Not guilty, Your Honor.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.195
- People on bail?
- State requests remand,

19:22.229 --> 19:23.730
given the seriousness
of the charge.

19:23.763 --> 19:24.831
The defendant
is not a resident,

19:24.864 --> 19:26.633
has no ties to the community.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.501
- Lucas is from
a small town in Indiana.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.537
He has no priors.
Given his age

19:30.570 --> 19:32.539
and his lack of resources,
he's not a flight risk.

19:32.572 --> 19:34.541
He doesn't even have
a passport.

19:34.574 --> 19:37.544
He's only standing here
because his religious beliefs

19:37.577 --> 19:38.811
aren't respected by the state.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.481
- Save it for trial,
Counselor.

19:41.514 --> 19:45.718
Bail is set at $100,000.
Cash or bond.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.254
- I don't have
that kind of money.

19:47.287 --> 19:48.821
- We have already started
a collection

19:48.855 --> 19:50.490
because the church
takes care of its own.

19:52.592 --> 19:58.265
- Next case.
Docket number 171002496.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.434
- I'm pleading with you,
Lieutenant.

20:01.468 --> 20:02.969
Don't make my daughter testify.

20:03.002 --> 20:06.473
She will be shunned
by the church, our community.

20:06.506 --> 20:09.276
This is a private matter.
- No, it's not, anymore.

20:09.309 --> 20:10.843
A crime has been committed.

20:10.877 --> 20:14.247
So now, unfortunately,
this is a public matter.

20:14.281 --> 20:16.749
- I don't understand.
Why are you making her do this?

20:16.783 --> 20:20.620
- I only asked your daughter
to tell me the truth.

20:20.653 --> 20:23.656
And she told me that that's
something that she valued.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.925
- The truth is Lucas Hull
tried to save her soul.

20:25.958 --> 20:29.962
- The truth is that your
daughter was sexually assaulted.

20:29.996 --> 20:32.599
- I knew she should never
have come to New York.

20:32.632 --> 20:35.568
Now her father is--he can't even
bring himself to come here.

20:35.602 --> 20:39.005
- Cheryl, Cheryl, please.
Let's just go.

20:39.038 --> 20:42.642
They think their secular law
takes precedent over God's law.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.010
But they'll find out
they're wrong.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.919
- I can imagine
what that was about.

20:52.952 --> 20:58.325
- These people really think
that nothing criminal happened.

20:58.358 --> 21:00.293
- Never underestimate
the power of faith.

21:00.327 --> 21:01.994
Regardless of where it's placed.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.730
Braun won't take a deal.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.633
- Yeah, because
Reverend Gary won't let him.

21:06.666 --> 21:10.503
If--if Lucas admits
that he committed a crime,

21:10.537 --> 21:13.640
then Reverend Gary loses face
with his congregation.

21:13.673 --> 21:16.343
- Okay, let's go over
Ann's testimony one more time.

21:16.376 --> 21:17.910
Make sure that she's consistent.
- Okay.

21:17.944 --> 21:20.046
- You know, he said,
she said, God said.

21:20.079 --> 21:23.316
You don't want God
to get the last word.

21:23.350 --> 21:25.017
[sighs]
Spoke too soon.

21:25.051 --> 21:26.786
Defense filed a motion
to dismiss

21:26.819 --> 21:28.655
based on First Amendment
protections.

21:28.688 --> 21:30.823
- So they're saying
that rape is okay

21:30.857 --> 21:32.725
if it's done
for religious reasons.

21:32.759 --> 21:34.361
- Huh. I don't remember
reading that in the Bible.

21:38.898 --> 21:41.734
- The church to which both
Lucas Hull and Ann Davenport

21:41.768 --> 21:45.338
belong holds firm in its belief
that homosexuality is sinful

21:45.372 --> 21:48.341
and that curative intercourse
is the appropriate remedy.

21:48.375 --> 21:49.876
Therefore, there was
tacit consent.

21:49.909 --> 21:51.878
- This argument is ridiculous.

21:51.911 --> 21:54.681
- [laughs] All religion is
ridiculous to the non-believer.

21:54.714 --> 21:56.949
That's the basis
for religious discrimination.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.651
In both Cantwell
versus Connecticut

21:58.685 --> 22:00.086
and Hobby Lobby--
- Neither of those cases

22:00.119 --> 22:02.121
involved a rape.

22:02.154 --> 22:04.357
Reynolds versus U.S. ruled that
the First Amendment protection

22:04.391 --> 22:06.826
did not entitle a person to act
on their religious beliefs

22:06.859 --> 22:08.628
in a way that violates the law.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.630
- Yeah, but this is not true
in People versus Moua,

22:10.663 --> 22:11.964
a 1985 case.
- It's not precedent,

22:11.998 --> 22:13.099
Your Honor.

22:13.132 --> 22:14.634
And the judge in that case

22:14.667 --> 22:16.369
handed down a reduced sentence.

22:16.403 --> 22:17.870
He didn't nullify the crime,
based on a religious argument.

22:17.904 --> 22:19.038
But if you'd like to
plead this out,

22:19.071 --> 22:20.807
my offer's still on the table.

22:20.840 --> 22:21.908
- In the eyes of the Lord--
the ultimate judge--

22:21.941 --> 22:23.576
my client is innocent.

22:23.610 --> 22:25.378
So I refuse to let Lucas
plead guilty.

22:25.412 --> 22:27.714
- Well, with all due respect
to the Almighty,

22:27.747 --> 22:31.017
His laws are meaningless
when it comes to sexual assault.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.853
- Good arguments.
I'll let the jury hear them.

22:33.886 --> 22:36.756
Motion to dismiss is denied.

22:38.891 --> 22:41.828
- Lieutenant Benson.

22:41.861 --> 22:45.031
- Lydia. Lydia, what are you--
what are you doing here?

22:45.064 --> 22:48.435
- I don't understand. Mr. Barba
said that he doesn't need me.

22:48.468 --> 22:50.737
That because of
my relationship with Ann,

22:50.770 --> 22:51.871
I could hurt the case.

22:51.904 --> 22:53.673
But nothing happened between us.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.041
- I understand that, Lydia.

22:55.074 --> 22:57.744
But it's just--
it's not that simple.

22:57.777 --> 22:59.045
- Are they gonna try
and make it look like

22:59.078 --> 23:01.180
Ann doesn't wanna be gay?

23:01.213 --> 23:03.850
- They will use that
as part of their defense.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.418
- She won't even call me back.

23:05.452 --> 23:07.720
- This has not
been easy for her.

23:07.754 --> 23:09.188
She has been focusing
on the trial.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.791
- It's all my fault.

23:11.824 --> 23:13.125
If Lucas hadn't
seen us together,

23:13.159 --> 23:15.061
Ann would not have been raped.
- Lydia,

23:15.094 --> 23:17.630
you are not to blame for this.

23:17.664 --> 23:20.166
- Oh, right.

23:20.199 --> 23:23.903
God is.

23:23.936 --> 23:26.072
I have to get inside.
I'm sorry.

23:31.143 --> 23:33.446
- Even if Ann did believe
that her attraction

23:33.480 --> 23:35.147
to women was sinful,

23:35.181 --> 23:36.783
she still has
the right to say no.

23:36.816 --> 23:39.018
- Lucas Hull and Ann Davenport

23:39.051 --> 23:42.955
both believe that homosexuality
is against God's law.

23:42.989 --> 23:46.759
And they both believe
that curative intercourse

23:46.793 --> 23:49.696
can help someone to overcome
what Ann herself

23:49.729 --> 23:51.030
viewed as a sickness.

23:51.063 --> 23:52.131
- Irrespective
of religious chatter

23:52.164 --> 23:53.933
or sanctimonious phrases,

23:53.966 --> 23:56.035
the case comes down
to one simple question:

23:56.068 --> 23:59.138
did Ann Davenport consent to
having sex with the defendant?

23:59.171 --> 24:04.511
If the answer is no,
that means she was raped.

24:04.544 --> 24:08.815
- Lucas knew that Lydia and I
were alone in my hotel room.

24:08.848 --> 24:11.984
And he was afraid that
I'd give in to temptation.

24:12.018 --> 24:15.187
He said that I needed
to feel the full glory

24:15.221 --> 24:18.858
of God's purpose
to overcome that lust.

24:18.891 --> 24:20.893
- How did you respond?
- I said that I could

24:20.927 --> 24:25.197
resist on my own, that I didn't
need him to do that.

24:25.231 --> 24:26.966
And he pushed me on the bed.

24:26.999 --> 24:28.735
- And then what happened?

24:28.768 --> 24:31.538
- He pulled up my skirt

24:31.571 --> 24:35.107
and he forced himself--

24:35.141 --> 24:37.877
he forced himself inside me.

24:37.910 --> 24:41.548
And I--I said no
and tried to fight him off.

24:41.581 --> 24:45.151
But he didn't stop.

24:45.184 --> 24:47.286
- When the police showed up,
why didn't you tell them

24:47.319 --> 24:49.922
that Lucas had done this?

24:49.956 --> 24:51.991
- 'Cause I didn't wanna
get him in trouble.

24:52.024 --> 24:54.126
He--he was doing
what he thought was right.

24:54.160 --> 24:57.163
- But you did not consent.

24:57.196 --> 24:59.899
- No.
- Thank you, Ann.

24:59.932 --> 25:01.901
Nothing further.

25:09.909 --> 25:13.913
- Ms. Davenport,
I sympathize with you.

25:13.946 --> 25:19.018
This--this can't be
an easy position to be in.

25:19.051 --> 25:21.754
You and Lucas are friends,
so when he came to your room,

25:21.788 --> 25:24.957
you didn't scream
or cry for help.

25:24.991 --> 25:27.026
- No.
- He didn't have a weapon.

25:27.059 --> 25:28.828
- No.
- And he didn't prevent you

25:28.861 --> 25:33.766
from leaving.
- No.

25:33.800 --> 25:37.069
- So when your lesbian friend--
- Objection.

25:37.103 --> 25:40.940
- Sustained.
Be careful, Mr. Braun.

25:40.973 --> 25:43.075
- When your friend
came back to your room,

25:43.109 --> 25:44.977
shortly after Lucas left,

25:45.011 --> 25:47.179
did you tell her
that you'd been raped?

25:47.213 --> 25:49.248
- No, I--

25:49.281 --> 25:51.918
I was upset.
She had asked what happened

25:51.951 --> 25:53.285
and I said that I had sex.

25:53.319 --> 25:56.188
That he made me do it.

25:56.222 --> 25:59.291
- Right, but you didn't use
the word rape or sexual assault.

25:59.325 --> 26:01.293
You didn't call the police.

26:01.327 --> 26:03.329
In fact, Ms. Banks called the
police against your wishes,

26:03.362 --> 26:05.064
didn't she?
- Yes, but--

26:05.097 --> 26:07.934
but she was just trying
to help me.

26:07.967 --> 26:10.169
- One more question.

26:10.202 --> 26:13.072
Are you in a romantic
relationship with Ms. Banks?

26:13.105 --> 26:15.942
- No, I--
- Is it possible

26:15.975 --> 26:17.109
that she wanted to be?

26:17.143 --> 26:18.210
That she came back to the room,

26:18.244 --> 26:20.079
hoping to seduce you

26:20.112 --> 26:21.347
and when she saw that
you'd had sex with Lucas,

26:21.380 --> 26:23.983
she got upset--
- Objection.

26:24.016 --> 26:25.652
- A moment, Your Honor.

26:30.890 --> 26:33.125
- Your Honor?
- Objection is sustained.

26:33.159 --> 26:35.327
Mr. Braun, are you with us?
- Withdrawn.

26:35.361 --> 26:37.029
However, at this point,
Your Honor,

26:37.063 --> 26:38.631
I'd like to continue my cross

26:38.665 --> 26:41.000
by admitting
the following video evidence

26:41.033 --> 26:42.301
as exhibit E.
- This is the first

26:42.334 --> 26:44.170
I'm hearing of this.
- That's because

26:44.203 --> 26:46.072
we've only just received it.

26:46.105 --> 26:47.940
But it pertains directly
to Ms. Davenport's testimony.

26:47.974 --> 26:50.109
- Yeah, nice try.
I need to review this evidence.

26:50.142 --> 26:51.644
- As do I.

26:51.678 --> 26:53.612
Court is in recess.
[bangs gavel]

26:58.284 --> 27:00.653
- Ann, I'm sorry
this got so complicated

27:00.687 --> 27:03.255
that you had to deal
with the police.

27:03.289 --> 27:06.192
- I know.
- I just--I didn't want you

27:06.225 --> 27:07.994
to have to live
a life like that.

27:08.027 --> 27:12.331
To be damned.
- I understand. I do.

27:12.364 --> 27:14.400
- Why did you say
that you were raped?

27:18.905 --> 27:22.008
- Maybe you were confused, Ann.
Is that it?

27:22.041 --> 27:25.144
Just overwhelmed with Lydia,

27:25.177 --> 27:28.147
with New York, the police.

27:28.180 --> 27:30.149
Is that why you said
you were assaulted?

27:30.182 --> 27:33.953
- Yes.
Yes, I guess.

27:33.986 --> 27:36.055
- Then it's--it's settled.

27:36.088 --> 27:39.091
What happened between the two
of you was a blessed event.

27:39.125 --> 27:41.060
Let's pray.

27:45.497 --> 27:47.299
- There goes our case.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.035
- Man plans, God laughs.

27:49.068 --> 27:51.938
- No, there's nothing funny
about Reverend Gary.

27:51.971 --> 27:54.173
Or rape...

28:04.383 --> 28:04.751
.

28:04.784 --> 28:05.684
- And after they had sex,
I counseled them.

28:07.319 --> 28:08.320
I found there was no malice

28:08.354 --> 28:09.889
between the two of them.

28:09.922 --> 28:11.290
Ann forgave Lucas
and understood that

28:11.323 --> 28:12.925
what he had done
was right and Godly.

28:12.959 --> 28:15.928
- And why did you
record this meeting?

28:15.962 --> 28:17.463
- Because I knew
the state of New York

28:17.496 --> 28:19.966
would not understand
or accept our beliefs.

28:19.999 --> 28:23.736
But my obligation lies with the
well-being of my congregants.

28:23.770 --> 28:26.806
Lucas should not be made
to suffer for saving Ann,

28:26.839 --> 28:29.475
for being a messenger
of God's will.

28:29.508 --> 28:30.943
- And is it your impression,

28:30.977 --> 28:34.446
as--as Ann's
spiritual counselor,

28:34.480 --> 28:37.349
that she wanted to be saved
from homosexuality?

28:37.383 --> 28:38.818
- Absolutely.

28:38.851 --> 28:40.853
I have no doubt
in my mind.

28:40.887 --> 28:42.354
We discussed it
on many occasions.

28:42.388 --> 28:43.956
- Objection, this is
privileged communication

28:43.990 --> 28:45.992
between a clergyman
and a congregant.

28:46.025 --> 28:47.960
Ms. Davenport does not
waive this privilege.

28:47.994 --> 28:49.896
- Sustained.

28:49.929 --> 28:52.264
- Reverend, one last question.

28:52.298 --> 28:54.466
As head of the church,
is it your belief

28:54.500 --> 28:59.371
that God condones--mandates--
curative intercourse?

28:59.405 --> 29:01.774
- Yes.

29:01.808 --> 29:04.811
- No further questions.

29:04.844 --> 29:08.247
- You were not in the hotel room
when Ann was assaulted.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.316
- No.
- You did not hear

29:10.349 --> 29:13.252
what she said or did not say.

29:13.285 --> 29:14.787
- That's correct.

29:14.821 --> 29:17.857
- You allege that
in your private meeting

29:17.890 --> 29:20.827
after the assault,
Ann forgave the defendant.

29:20.860 --> 29:23.062
- I'm certain of it.
I was there.

29:23.095 --> 29:24.864
- You are certain of that.
You believe that

29:24.897 --> 29:27.099
she forgave him, that her
forgiveness was genuine.

29:27.133 --> 29:28.534
- Absolutely.
- Then the defendant

29:28.567 --> 29:31.337
must have done something wrong.

29:31.370 --> 29:35.007
Doesn't granting forgiveness
imply a crime--

29:35.041 --> 29:39.345
a transgression that needs to be
forgiven in the first place?

29:39.378 --> 29:40.913
- Yes, but--
- Yes.

29:40.947 --> 29:42.849
- You do not understand
our core beliefs.

29:42.882 --> 29:44.550
You do not understand--
- This is not about beliefs!

29:44.583 --> 29:46.919
It's not about God.
It's not about homosexuality.

29:46.953 --> 29:48.020
It's about a crime.

29:48.054 --> 29:49.956
It's about a woman who says no

29:49.989 --> 29:51.290
and a man rapes her anyway.

29:51.323 --> 29:53.125
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

29:59.065 --> 30:01.333
- I waited for Lydia
and Charlotte to leave

30:01.367 --> 30:04.403
and then I knocked on Ann's door
and she let me in.

30:04.436 --> 30:06.072
- And then what happened?

30:06.105 --> 30:07.974
- I explained to her
why I was there.

30:08.007 --> 30:12.511
What had to happen.
What--what God asked of us.

30:12.544 --> 30:14.580
- And how did she respond?

30:14.613 --> 30:16.415
- She was scared.

30:16.448 --> 30:18.017
I was, too.

30:18.050 --> 30:19.585
Neither of us had
done that before

30:19.618 --> 30:21.120
and--and we're not married.

30:21.153 --> 30:23.455
But I knew it was
my responsibility

30:23.489 --> 30:24.857
to free her from sin.

30:24.891 --> 30:27.459
So--so I laid her on the bed.

30:27.493 --> 30:30.362
- And did she--did she resist?

30:30.396 --> 30:34.066
- She was tense.
It wasn't easy.

30:34.100 --> 30:37.103
but I believe she knew
what had to happen.

30:37.136 --> 30:40.873
What Reverend Gary
and what God wanted us to do.

30:40.907 --> 30:44.376
- Lucas, what happened
afterwards?

30:44.410 --> 30:46.879
- She was crying a little.

30:46.913 --> 30:48.580
She was upset.

30:48.614 --> 30:50.983
I was, too.
It was really difficult

30:51.017 --> 30:52.985
for the both of us.

30:53.019 --> 30:56.488
And then she told me that
she understood why I did it.

30:56.522 --> 30:57.957
And that I should go.

30:57.990 --> 31:00.059
- Did she, at any point,

31:00.092 --> 31:01.493
say that she had been raped

31:01.527 --> 31:03.629
or that she was going to
call the police?

31:03.662 --> 31:07.166
- No. Reverend Gary said that
Lydia called the police

31:07.199 --> 31:09.101
and that's why
they were involved.

31:09.135 --> 31:11.971
And when they came to me,
I-I told them the truth.

31:12.004 --> 31:15.107
Every word of it.

31:15.141 --> 31:17.076
- Thank you, Lucas.

31:22.681 --> 31:25.017
- Do you consider Ann
to be truthful?

31:25.051 --> 31:26.552
- Absolutely.

31:26.585 --> 31:28.587
- Have you ever
known her to lie?

31:28.620 --> 31:31.657
- She wouldn't.
It's not in her nature.

31:31.690 --> 31:34.560
- Can you explain
why her testimony

31:34.593 --> 31:37.696
directly refutes yours?

31:37.729 --> 31:40.532
I quote, "He pulled up my skirt,
he forced himself inside me.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.434
"I said no, I tried
to push him off.

31:42.468 --> 31:45.571
He didn't stop."
- She didn't lie.

31:45.604 --> 31:47.139
- Mm.

31:47.173 --> 31:49.141
- She was experiencing
a union with God.

31:49.175 --> 31:50.476
It's--it's what happens.

31:50.509 --> 31:52.178
It's like Reverend Gary says.

31:52.211 --> 31:54.446
Resist the devil,
and he will flee from you.

31:54.480 --> 31:57.449
- So she was resisting.
- Her demons were resisting

31:57.483 --> 32:00.519
and sometimes, you have to fight
through them to save someone.

32:00.552 --> 32:04.556
And if I'm the one that has to
pay for it, so be it.

32:04.590 --> 32:07.493
But I-I love Ann.

32:10.529 --> 32:13.599
I would never want
to hurt her.

32:13.632 --> 32:15.201
- You did.

32:21.007 --> 32:23.609
- Defense looks happy.
- They should be.

32:23.642 --> 32:26.012
Lucas is earnest, sincere,
telling the truth.

32:26.045 --> 32:28.580
- Are you saying
that we lost the jury?

32:28.614 --> 32:30.249
- Quite possible.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.051
- Well, you're not thinking
of taking a deal.

32:32.084 --> 32:34.586
- No. They're all complicit.

32:34.620 --> 32:38.090
- So when are we gonna
go after the real villain?

32:38.124 --> 32:39.591
- The Reverend.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.193
- You heard Lucas on the stand.

32:41.227 --> 32:43.595
You saw that video.
- We would need to prove

32:43.629 --> 32:45.464
that Gary ordered Lucas
to rape Ann.

32:45.497 --> 32:49.068
- And Lucas is the only one
who can tell us that.

32:49.101 --> 32:51.003
Let me do some digging.

32:51.037 --> 32:55.174
See what I can find out about
Lucas and Gary's relationship.

32:58.110 --> 32:59.611
- That was Lucas' parents.

32:59.645 --> 33:01.513
Turns out he quit school
in the 12th grade.

33:01.547 --> 33:03.549
Spent the next year
living with

33:03.582 --> 33:05.317
and being home schooled by Gary.

33:05.351 --> 33:07.753
- Did they say why?
- Apparently Gary

33:07.786 --> 33:10.522
has special students
he looks out for.

33:10.556 --> 33:12.124
Lucas was just one of them,

33:12.158 --> 33:14.760
Studying his faith
as Gary's apprentice.

33:14.793 --> 33:16.228
You know, keep him
out of trouble.

33:16.262 --> 33:18.030
And what that is,
they didn't know.

33:18.064 --> 33:19.631
- That could mean anything.

33:19.665 --> 33:22.768
- So which one of you guys
is gonna call Liv?

33:22.801 --> 33:27.073
This is me delegating,
practicing my sergeant skills.

33:29.175 --> 33:32.611
- Ahh. Don't keep us
in suspense.

33:32.644 --> 33:34.080
Why are we here?
I already told you

33:34.113 --> 33:35.747
my client's not taking a deal.

33:35.781 --> 33:38.184
- What if I were to propose
a much better deal?

33:38.217 --> 33:40.652
We don't think your client
is the only guilty party here.

33:40.686 --> 33:43.689
- Excuse me?
- We want the Reverend.

33:43.722 --> 33:45.791
Lucas, Reverend Gary
is the one who told you

33:45.824 --> 33:48.194
that you could
cure Ann, correct?

33:48.227 --> 33:50.129
- Wait, wait, don't answer.
- He's also the one

33:50.162 --> 33:52.331
who told you and Ann to cover it
up and not report it, right?

33:52.364 --> 33:54.200
- Guys, where are we
going with this?

33:54.233 --> 33:55.834
- Lucas, if there are
extenuating circumstances,

33:55.867 --> 33:57.669
if the Reverend Gary
has some kind of hold on you,

33:57.703 --> 34:00.772
we need to know.
It's in your best interest.

34:00.806 --> 34:02.574
- I'm not sure what you mean.

34:02.608 --> 34:05.344
- We know that you
lived with him for a year.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.546
- Can you tell us why?

34:07.579 --> 34:09.315
- I got into trouble
at school.

34:09.348 --> 34:11.550
- Okay.

34:11.583 --> 34:13.819
Who decided you should
live with Reverend Gary?

34:13.852 --> 34:15.721
- He did.

34:15.754 --> 34:19.391
- And you do whatever
Gary tells you to do, right?

34:19.425 --> 34:22.128
I'm not judging. I grew up
in faith, I understand.

34:22.161 --> 34:24.296
When I was a teenager,
if a priest told me to jump,

34:24.330 --> 34:25.831
I'd only ask how high.

34:25.864 --> 34:28.267
- It was the best thing
that could've happened.

34:28.300 --> 34:30.302
I learned so much.

34:30.336 --> 34:32.604
He taught me to trust
in God's plan.

34:32.638 --> 34:34.273
- You here for trial on rape,
that seem like

34:34.306 --> 34:36.242
part of God's plan to you?
- It has to be.

34:36.275 --> 34:38.210
- He told you that you
had to live with him.

34:38.244 --> 34:40.646
He told you to quit school.

34:40.679 --> 34:42.381
- Not just me.
There were others.

34:42.414 --> 34:46.185
- Okay. So what else did he tell
you and the others to do?

34:46.218 --> 34:49.221
- Our chores at
the house and the church.

34:49.255 --> 34:52.124
He--he made sure that
we studied the Scriptures.

34:52.158 --> 34:54.693
He took us to other counties
so that we could volunteer

34:54.726 --> 34:56.595
for their youth programs.
- Did he ever ask you

34:56.628 --> 34:58.730
to perform curative intercourse
before?

34:58.764 --> 35:00.699
- All right, don't, Lucas.
- You don't understand

35:00.732 --> 35:02.201
him or us.

35:02.234 --> 35:04.336
He showed me the path
to righteousness.

35:04.370 --> 35:08.207
- Lucas, look, I'm sure that
when he's quoting the Bible,

35:08.240 --> 35:10.209
it sounds like he really
knows what he's talking about.

35:10.242 --> 35:12.411
But you gotta trust me,
somebody uses God

35:12.444 --> 35:15.414
as an excuse to commit crimes--
- You've got him all wrong.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.683
- He told you to assault Ann.

35:17.716 --> 35:18.784
- He saw Lydia with her!

35:18.817 --> 35:20.619
He knew she was in trouble

35:20.652 --> 35:21.920
and that we were out of time.
- So he ordered

35:21.953 --> 35:23.855
it specifically--
- No, he saved me!

35:23.889 --> 35:25.257
He's not the sinner, I am!

35:25.291 --> 35:29.928
It was my penance!

35:29.961 --> 35:32.398
- Penance? Penance for what?

35:40.706 --> 35:43.842
- Ann didn't just confide in me
because we're friends.

35:43.875 --> 35:46.778
We succumbed
to the same temptation.

35:50.382 --> 35:51.917
I never--

35:51.950 --> 35:55.721
I never got into
any trouble at school.

35:55.754 --> 35:57.889
Reverend Gary
caught me one night

35:57.923 --> 36:01.227
with a friend.

36:18.677 --> 36:18.844
.

36:18.877 --> 36:19.711
- So Lucas is gay?
The Reverend caught him?

36:22.248 --> 36:23.649
- That's what Lucas said.
Once the kid confessed,

36:23.682 --> 36:24.750
he couldn't stop talking.
- The curative part

36:24.783 --> 36:25.751
was supposed to go both ways.

36:25.784 --> 36:27.486
On Lucas and on Ann.

36:27.519 --> 36:29.521
- And he agreed to testify
against Gary,

36:29.555 --> 36:30.756
maybe enough to charge him
as an accomplice.

36:30.789 --> 36:32.458
- I found something else.

36:32.491 --> 36:34.326
The church's bank statements.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.228
Lucas said he was paid
a monthly stipend of $200.

36:36.262 --> 36:38.597
- Yeah, that was for, you know,
maintenance, chores.

36:38.630 --> 36:41.700
- Maybe, sure, but I found--

36:41.733 --> 36:43.502
I mean, I found disbursements
for $200

36:43.535 --> 36:46.772
for half a dozen other kids,
going back years.

36:46.805 --> 36:48.774
- Lucas did say he wasn't
the only kid living there.

36:48.807 --> 36:50.742
- If we can prove that
any of the other boys

36:50.776 --> 36:53.379
working for Gary got paid
for curatively raping someone,

36:53.412 --> 36:55.381
you've got sex trafficking.

36:55.414 --> 36:57.416
- Yeah, but we can't know
without their cooperation.

36:57.449 --> 36:58.784
- Well, Gary doesn't know that.

36:58.817 --> 37:00.519
He doesn't know
what Lucas told us.

37:00.552 --> 37:01.787
- Asset forfeiture laws
are very strong

37:01.820 --> 37:03.622
under sex trafficking.

37:03.655 --> 37:05.591
- Well, the church
has a lot to forfeit.

37:05.624 --> 37:07.593
They've got hundreds of
thousands earmarked

37:07.626 --> 37:09.428
for missionary work,
homeless shelters.

37:09.461 --> 37:10.829
- Okay, let's hit this guy
where it hurts the most.

37:10.862 --> 37:13.499
- Okay, so bring him in
and see if Gary

37:13.532 --> 37:15.367
really is a man of God.

37:17.369 --> 37:18.604
- It's not enough that
you turn Ann against me.

37:18.637 --> 37:19.838
You perverted Lucas, too.

37:19.871 --> 37:21.640
- You did that
all on your own, Gary.

37:21.673 --> 37:23.609
- No, I was trying
to save their lives.

37:23.642 --> 37:25.577
Their souls.
- They're kids,

37:25.611 --> 37:27.579
with normal sexual desires,
but you made them feel like

37:27.613 --> 37:28.747
they had the devil inside them.

37:28.780 --> 37:31.583
- They do.
And it kills me.

37:31.617 --> 37:33.652
You have no idea
how much I love them.

37:33.685 --> 37:35.821
All I want to do is protect them

37:35.854 --> 37:37.823
from the sins of the world,
from themselves.

37:37.856 --> 37:41.427
- But you--you can't rape
the gay out of somebody.

37:41.460 --> 37:43.429
Conversion therapy
doesn't work.

37:43.462 --> 37:44.830
- But you're never gonna
believe that, are you?

37:44.863 --> 37:46.865
- Guys, I hope we're not here
so you can try to

37:46.898 --> 37:49.301
convince my client that his
religious beliefs are criminal.

37:49.335 --> 37:50.836
- No. He believes what
he believes and we get that.

37:50.869 --> 37:53.805
- What you had Lucas do to Ann,
that is a crime.

37:53.839 --> 37:55.374
It's sex trafficking.

37:55.407 --> 37:57.376
- Sex trafficking.
Come on.

37:57.409 --> 37:58.744
- Come on? All right.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.546
We found the payments.

38:00.579 --> 38:02.581
Not just to Lucas,
but to the others, too.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.416
And I promise you,
we're gonna talk

38:04.450 --> 38:06.352
to every single one of them.
- The Lord Himself

38:06.385 --> 38:08.454
sent those children to me
to save them.

38:08.487 --> 38:10.356
- And you don't have
jurisdiction in Indiana.

38:10.389 --> 38:11.823
- He's right, we don't.

38:11.857 --> 38:14.426
But the Feds do.
And if we call them

38:14.460 --> 38:15.727
on an interstate
trafficking case,

38:15.761 --> 38:17.363
the first thing they're gonna do

38:17.396 --> 38:18.730
is seize all
your church's assets.

38:18.764 --> 38:20.732
Every single penny, gone.

38:20.766 --> 38:24.870
- I have over 900 congregants
who raise money for the poor,

38:24.903 --> 38:26.672
for disaster relief,
for missionary work.

38:26.705 --> 38:28.340
We're good people.
- I agree.

38:28.374 --> 38:29.875
Your church has done
some good things.

38:29.908 --> 38:31.777
But the road to hell
is paved with good intentions.

38:31.810 --> 38:34.480
And the road that
we're on right now,

38:34.513 --> 38:37.416
every person you've ever
preached to will be tainted.

38:37.449 --> 38:38.484
Everything you've ever built.

38:38.517 --> 38:39.818
Everything that you've ever

38:39.851 --> 38:42.488
worked for will vanish.

38:42.521 --> 38:45.791
- Unless you make a deal.

38:45.824 --> 38:47.459
You're gonna plead guilty.

38:47.493 --> 38:51.997
- You know what?
I think we're done here.

38:52.030 --> 38:53.665
- Wait.

38:58.770 --> 39:03.442
The people that we help
don't deserve this.

39:03.475 --> 39:04.743
My congregation
doesn't deserve this.

39:04.776 --> 39:06.445
- Reverend, this is blackmail.

39:06.478 --> 39:10.482
- No. This is my burden.

39:10.516 --> 39:13.952
This is my church;
these are my people.

39:13.985 --> 39:17.623
And if it means
I have to sacrifice myself

39:17.656 --> 39:19.958
in order to save them,

39:19.991 --> 39:21.560
then so be it.

39:28.967 --> 39:30.869
- He's really going for it.

39:30.902 --> 39:33.572
- I'll offer a plea
for facilitation.

39:33.605 --> 39:35.807
As long as it stops that church
from conspiring to commit rape.

39:35.841 --> 39:37.643
- Well, whatever
the judge gives him,

39:37.676 --> 39:42.414
it'll give him plenty of time
to get right with God.

39:42.448 --> 39:44.583
And Lucas?
- [sighs]

39:44.616 --> 39:46.952
He held up his end
of the bargain.

39:46.985 --> 39:49.455
Rape three.
One to four.

39:49.488 --> 39:50.722
- Do you know what the most
frightening part

39:50.756 --> 39:52.424
of all of this is?

39:52.458 --> 39:54.760
It's that the Reverend
actually believes

39:54.793 --> 39:56.995
that he's doing the right thing.

39:57.028 --> 39:59.798
- Yeah. So do his congregants.

39:59.831 --> 40:01.767
- Which is even more
frightening.

40:11.610 --> 40:13.712
- How are you?

40:13.745 --> 40:15.747
- Okay.

40:15.781 --> 40:18.984
Praying a lot.

40:19.017 --> 40:23.522
Ann, I'm so sorry.

40:23.555 --> 40:26.858
I should've listened.

40:26.892 --> 40:30.562
But questioning God--
- Is wrong, yeah.

40:30.596 --> 40:33.832
Reverend Gary told me that, too.

40:33.865 --> 40:35.901
But--

40:35.934 --> 40:38.604
Maybe we have to
decide for ourselves

40:38.637 --> 40:40.739
what--what God's saying.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.608
- We don't get to decide
right from wrong.

40:42.641 --> 40:45.043
- That's what you did
when I was with Lydia

40:45.076 --> 40:48.013
in my hotel room.

40:48.046 --> 40:50.549
I had a choice,
and you took it away.

40:55.521 --> 40:58.757
Lucas, I forgive you.

40:58.790 --> 41:00.992
But you can't change people.

41:01.026 --> 41:05.030
Not like that.

41:05.063 --> 41:09.635
God made us this way. How can we
be any less than perfect?

41:09.668 --> 41:13.772
How can love--any love--
be wrong?

41:18.009 --> 41:19.711
- Ann, it's time to go.
- [crying]

41:31.757 --> 41:33.859
- Well, that certainly
couldn't have been easy.

41:33.892 --> 41:36.562
- No, it wasn't.

41:36.595 --> 41:39.130
- So, Ann, what will you do now?

41:39.164 --> 41:41.700
- I have some cousins
in Denver I'm gonna stay with.

41:41.733 --> 41:43.168
Figure things out.
- Good.

41:43.201 --> 41:46.672
- I'm definitely not coming back
to New York anymore.

41:46.705 --> 41:48.173
- And what about your parents?

41:48.206 --> 41:49.775
- They're not ready yet.

41:49.808 --> 41:53.044
Maybe they will be one day.

41:53.078 --> 41:54.980
- You know, things get better.

41:55.013 --> 41:59.585
They get easier with time.

41:59.618 --> 42:00.986
- And with faith.
