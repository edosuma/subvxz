01:27.454 --> 01:29.650
I'm going to bring
her out here right now.

01:29.722 --> 01:30.848
Dolores.

01:51.077 --> 01:53.239
While the Reverend
Martin Luther King, Jr.

01:53.313 --> 01:55.509
Was leading the charge
in the South,

01:55.582 --> 01:58.381
one California woman
was fighting on the front lines

01:58.451 --> 01:59.850
for workers' rights.

02:02.455 --> 02:05.823
And while her name is rarely
mentioned in the history books,

02:05.892 --> 02:07.257
she may just be

02:07.327 --> 02:11.491
the most vocal activist
you've never heard of.

02:11.564 --> 02:14.226
Come along, brothers.
We are waiting for you!

02:14.300 --> 02:18.362
Dolores Huerta helped
lead a worldwide grape boycott

02:18.438 --> 02:19.667
that forced growers to agree

02:19.739 --> 02:22.640
to some of the country's
first farmworker contracts.

02:25.111 --> 02:26.111
<i>Viva la cause!</i>

02:27.113 --> 02:29.241
<i>Viva la huelgal.</i>

02:29.315 --> 02:32.615
She's the first general
that I followed into war.

02:35.088 --> 02:38.251
The workers are on the rise.

02:38.324 --> 02:40.622
Dolores Huerta,
who is an old friend of mine...

02:42.896 --> 02:45.627
What she is, she's an insult
to the farmworker.

02:45.698 --> 02:48.395
Why are the growers and
the teamsters so against her?

02:48.468 --> 02:49.731
Because they're threatened.

02:52.205 --> 02:54.674
We're never giving up.

02:54.741 --> 02:56.106
Dolores is an icon.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.372
Dolores Huerta has said

02:58.444 --> 02:59.969
Republicans hate Latinos.

03:03.116 --> 03:04.914
She also writes

03:04.984 --> 03:08.284
the alternative to capitalism is
democratic socialism.

03:08.354 --> 03:09.398
She's not afraid

03:09.422 --> 03:10.912
to speak truth to power.

03:14.694 --> 03:15.718
She's a clown.

03:15.795 --> 03:18.389
We thank you
for all you have done

03:18.464 --> 03:19.693
and all you still do

03:19.766 --> 03:21.325
to promote the dignity
and human rights

03:21.401 --> 03:23.096
of America's family.

03:25.572 --> 03:27.597
She's a civil rights hero.

03:27.674 --> 03:30.075
She's been beaten up
and she's gone to jail.

03:30.143 --> 03:31.076
She's a very volatile
individual.

03:31.144 --> 03:32.407
We always like to say

03:32.478 --> 03:34.638
that we didn't cross the border,
the border crossed us.

03:34.681 --> 03:37.013
The FBI knew

03:37.083 --> 03:38.123
how dangerous Dolores was.

03:41.487 --> 03:43.751
Conservatives on
the Texas Board of Education

03:43.823 --> 03:46.758
removed the legendary farmworker
organizer Dolores Huerta

03:46.826 --> 03:49.625
from the state social studies
curriculum.

03:49.696 --> 03:51.240
I got to tell you,
I never heard of this woman.

03:51.264 --> 03:52.129
We've really got

03:52.198 --> 03:53.359
to set the record straight.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.731
I mean, women cannot be written
out of history.

04:06.646 --> 04:08.114
You were a young girl,

04:08.181 --> 04:10.411
growing up in America
in the '40s.

04:10.483 --> 04:12.918
You must have had a dream.

04:15.488 --> 04:17.466
I guess my only dream
was just to be accepted.

04:17.490 --> 04:20.653
I think that's what
a lot of young children feel,

04:20.726 --> 04:24.857
just to be accepted for what you
are and that's not possible.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.059
Tell me when
you were first aware

04:27.133 --> 04:29.329
of having a social conscience.

04:29.402 --> 04:31.734
I think that
I felt it very deeply

04:31.804 --> 04:35.035
as a teenager and it was mostly
because of the police brutality

04:35.108 --> 04:38.043
against Mexicans and blacks,

04:38.111 --> 04:40.773
the kids that I grew up with,

04:40.847 --> 04:43.544
and you find out that
the justice, it's not there.

04:43.616 --> 04:46.551
The equality isn't there.

04:46.619 --> 04:49.350
If you were coming of age
in the 19505

04:49.422 --> 04:52.824
in California
in the San Joaquin Valley,

04:52.892 --> 04:56.226
you were coming of age
in a time of conformity.

04:56.296 --> 04:59.630
Everybody was being fit
into a mold,

04:59.699 --> 05:01.963
and if you were Dolores Huerta,

05:02.035 --> 05:04.367
there was no mold.

05:04.437 --> 05:06.115
My mom, she grew up in the '40s,

05:06.139 --> 05:08.801
you know, like the dances,
the bebop, the big band,

05:08.875 --> 05:09.875
the swing, you know.

05:09.909 --> 05:11.673
She's an American girl,
you know.

05:11.744 --> 05:14.941
Back in those days,
all of the Latina women

05:15.014 --> 05:18.211
got married very young...
15,16,17 years old.

05:18.284 --> 05:21.083
My first husband,
we had a lot in common.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.644
We were both into jazz,

05:22.722 --> 05:25.692
but I don't think that
we were ready for marriage yet.

05:25.758 --> 05:29.160
Then my second husband,
we had kind of a culture clash

05:29.228 --> 05:30.696
because of the way
that I grew up

05:30.763 --> 05:32.197
and the way that he grew up.

05:32.265 --> 05:35.428
My mother was a single parent,
she was a businesswoman,

05:35.501 --> 05:38.198
and like her,
I worked all the time.

05:38.271 --> 05:40.015
You know, my mother-in-law
could never understand why

05:40.039 --> 05:41.973
I didn't just stay home
with the children.

05:42.041 --> 05:46.000
And so, Dolores talks about
her life as a young mother

05:46.079 --> 05:47.843
and as a married woman

05:47.914 --> 05:49.678
and not feeling
that was quite enough,

05:49.749 --> 05:53.481
that she needed to do
more than that.

05:53.553 --> 05:55.612
That's when she met Fred Ross.

05:56.989 --> 05:59.219
When I met Fred
Ross and he talked to me

05:59.292 --> 06:00.760
about how people could
get together

06:00.827 --> 06:02.805
in an organization and really
start changing things,

06:02.829 --> 06:04.593
to me it was just a revelation.

06:04.664 --> 06:07.895
LORI de LEON: Fred Ross
was a community organizer

06:07.967 --> 06:10.493
with the Community Service
Organization

06:10.570 --> 06:12.629
who developed house meetings.

06:12.705 --> 06:14.070
You're on the ground,

06:14.140 --> 06:17.007
identifying individuals
who are willing, you know,

06:17.076 --> 06:19.875
to do the work
to make the communities better.

06:19.946 --> 06:22.813
I still remember
my first house meeting.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.493
Fred showed us pictures
of the improvements

06:24.517 --> 06:26.986
that they had done
in East Los Angeles,

06:27.053 --> 06:29.249
like bringing in
street lights and sidewalks,

06:29.322 --> 06:31.188
bringing in health clinics.

06:31.257 --> 06:32.816
But the one that
really hooked me

06:32.892 --> 06:35.657
was when he showed us
press clippings of police

06:35.728 --> 06:37.787
that they had sent to prison

06:37.864 --> 06:40.595
for beating up
Mexican-American kids.

06:40.666 --> 06:42.478
And I thought, any organization
that can do that,

06:42.502 --> 06:44.766
I want to belong
to that organization.

06:46.472 --> 06:48.907
I think that my mom experienced

06:48.975 --> 06:51.740
enough of that injustice
or discrimination to where

06:51.811 --> 06:54.075
she just could not keep it down.

06:54.147 --> 06:55.581
She could not keep quiet.

06:57.617 --> 06:59.984
In 1959, I became
the political director

07:00.052 --> 07:01.952
for the Community Service
Organization,

07:02.021 --> 07:04.547
and helped draft
a lot of the legislation

07:04.624 --> 07:07.491
that we ultimately got approved
in Sacramento.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.460
I was only 25 at this time,
or 26 years old.

07:09.529 --> 07:11.088
I was very young.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.496
There were
very, very few Latinos-

07:13.566 --> 07:15.056
and I'm talking about men...

07:15.134 --> 07:18.001
In the legislature in California
in the '50s and '60s.

07:18.070 --> 07:19.663
It was all white men,

07:19.739 --> 07:21.639
and here you have someone

07:21.707 --> 07:23.573
like Dolores Huerta,
that was just...

07:23.643 --> 07:25.907
People just didn't do that
in those days.

07:25.978 --> 07:30.279
We had one piece of legislation
to take away the requirement

07:30.349 --> 07:31.783
that you had to be
a U.S. citizen

07:31.851 --> 07:33.580
to get public assistance.

07:33.653 --> 07:36.714
I took parents whose kids
had served in World War II

07:36.789 --> 07:40.316
to this one senator who was key
for us to get that legislation,

07:40.393 --> 07:41.952
sat them in his office

07:42.028 --> 07:45.658
with the pictures of their kids
in uniform.

07:45.731 --> 07:47.324
They couldn't speak English,

07:47.400 --> 07:49.767
Senator Kolbe couldn't speak
Spanish, but I told them,

07:49.836 --> 07:51.634
"Just stay here
until he says yes,

07:51.704 --> 07:53.468
that he'll vote on that bill."

07:53.539 --> 07:55.200
What kind of a lobbyist is she?

07:55.274 --> 07:57.242
Oh, she's a great lobbyist.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.506
She's indefatigable.

07:59.579 --> 08:00.944
She's unorthodox.

08:01.013 --> 08:03.345
You know, Dolores will bring in
hundreds of people

08:03.416 --> 08:05.851
and they'll camp
outside your office.

08:05.918 --> 08:07.716
So when Dolores
is in Sacramento,

08:07.787 --> 08:10.722
everybody knows
she's in Sacramento.

08:10.790 --> 08:13.589
Fred Ross was
always talking about

08:13.659 --> 08:16.094
this great organizer,
Cesar Chavez,

08:16.162 --> 08:18.995
so Fred introduced us.

08:19.065 --> 08:21.227
Cesar was very shy.

08:21.300 --> 08:22.597
I remember one time

08:22.668 --> 08:24.762
that he was sitting down
by himself at a table

08:24.837 --> 08:26.635
and so I rushed over
and sat down

08:26.706 --> 08:28.697
and started trying
to talk to him

08:28.774 --> 08:30.936
and he immediately got up
and walked away.

08:31.010 --> 08:34.775
Fred would always tell
Cesar how he met this woman,

08:34.847 --> 08:37.578
she's dynamite, great organizer.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.118
He was a little bit jealous

08:39.184 --> 08:41.414
when Fred would talk to him
about her.

08:41.486 --> 08:43.011
He was a little bit jealous
about that.

08:43.089 --> 08:45.649
I gave my report
on the legislative work

08:45.725 --> 08:47.693
that we were doing
up in Sacramento.

08:47.760 --> 08:50.161
He and Fred Ross came over
and invited me

08:50.229 --> 08:51.458
to have lunch with them

08:51.531 --> 08:53.465
so I was very thrilled,
because I thought,

08:53.533 --> 08:57.333
"Oh my, Cesar's finally paying
attention to what I'm doing."

08:57.403 --> 09:01.533
They were having a meeting and
they needed a Chicano legislator

09:01.607 --> 09:05.601
to do some things and he was
arguing why it couldn't be done.

09:05.678 --> 09:08.010
And it was when my mother
began telling him

09:08.080 --> 09:10.174
all the reasons why he needed
to get done

09:10.249 --> 09:12.149
that Cesar took a step back
and he goes,

09:12.218 --> 09:15.119
"Now I see what Fred
was talking about."

09:17.356 --> 09:19.051
All this work
that we were doing,

09:19.125 --> 09:21.526
Cesar organizing the farmworkers
in Oxnard,

09:21.594 --> 09:24.029
my organizing farmworkers
in Stockton,

09:24.096 --> 09:27.555
was under the auspices of the
Community Service Organization.

09:27.633 --> 09:29.965
But when it came time then
to make it a union,

09:30.036 --> 09:33.028
the CS0 decided
not to support us.

09:33.105 --> 09:36.735
That's when Cesar called me
to come over to his house

09:36.809 --> 09:39.403
and he said,
"We have to organize a union."

09:39.478 --> 09:42.812
He put it this way, he said,
"Unless you and I do it,

09:42.882 --> 09:44.976
it's never going to happen."

09:45.051 --> 09:46.951
And then he said
in the next breath,

09:47.019 --> 09:50.455
"But we will not see
a national union in our lifetime

09:50.523 --> 09:53.652
"because the growers are
too rich, they're too powerful,

09:53.726 --> 09:56.957
and they're too racist."

10:13.079 --> 10:15.514
One of the really
tragic contradictions

10:15.581 --> 10:18.175
about the United States
of America is that

10:18.250 --> 10:20.014
it has presented itself
before the world

10:20.086 --> 10:24.546
as a beacon of independence
and liberty and human rights.

10:24.624 --> 10:25.955
Of course,

10:26.025 --> 10:31.054
the real stain on this mythology
is slavery

10:31.130 --> 10:35.829
and with it, the potential
for the enslavement of others.

10:35.901 --> 10:37.926
This was a very real threat
for all Mexicans

10:38.004 --> 10:40.234
living in California.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.070
After 1848,

10:42.141 --> 10:43.885
it was a continuing threat
for all of the immigrants

10:43.909 --> 10:48.176
that came from China, Japan,
the Philippines, Vietnam.

10:48.247 --> 10:51.114
Racism has been endemic
to American history.

10:51.183 --> 10:56.212
The feudal wage slavery
of agribusiness

10:56.288 --> 10:58.017
is really just an extension
of the attitude

10:58.090 --> 11:00.491
that had persisted
in the country

11:00.559 --> 11:03.324
and the irony is that none of us
can live without food.

11:03.396 --> 11:06.627
None of us can live without
what's produced in our fields.

11:06.699 --> 11:08.292
This is life,

11:08.367 --> 11:14.568
and yet these are the worst-paid
workers on the planet.

11:14.640 --> 11:17.837
When we came
here to this little, tiny town

11:17.910 --> 11:20.902
in California called Delano,

11:20.980 --> 11:23.915
I started working in the fields
when I was 15 years old

11:23.983 --> 11:26.577
and they were paying
90 cents per hour.

11:26.652 --> 11:29.087
There was no cold drinking water

11:29.155 --> 11:31.852
and the weather gets to be
about 115 degrees.

11:31.924 --> 11:34.052
If you complained
about any of these conditions,

11:34.126 --> 11:36.925
you were told
to get the hell out.

11:36.996 --> 11:38.206
There were plenty
of other people

11:38.230 --> 11:40.164
that could come
and take your place.

11:40.232 --> 11:43.258
And the women
were treated worse than the men.

11:43.335 --> 11:44.666
You had no protection.

11:44.737 --> 11:46.000
There was a lot of mistreatment

11:46.072 --> 11:47.972
and a lot of rape,
there was a lot of...

11:48.040 --> 11:49.838
I mean there's a lot
of that went on.

11:49.909 --> 11:53.436
My grandfather
was living on a vineyard

11:53.512 --> 11:58.712
in a house that was owned
by the people who employed him.

11:58.784 --> 12:01.412
It was sort of this sense
of slavery, right?

12:01.487 --> 12:04.013
You couldn't do anything wrong
against your employer,

12:04.090 --> 12:06.991
because if you did, were they
going to kick out your family?

12:07.059 --> 12:08.493
Where were you going to go?

12:08.561 --> 12:09.756
You don't speak the language.

12:09.829 --> 12:11.991
You're not even a citizen
of the country yet.

12:12.064 --> 12:13.241
They used to say

12:13.265 --> 12:15.029
that they wanted
to hire Mexicans

12:15.101 --> 12:18.162
because we were built
closer to the ground,

12:18.237 --> 12:21.969
and that, in my opinion,
was the worst part:

12:22.041 --> 12:26.911
The humiliation of knowing that
people held you in contempt.

12:33.419 --> 12:38.823
After I had seen the
miserable conditions of farmworkers

12:38.891 --> 12:41.326
and knowing
how to organize people,

12:41.393 --> 12:45.057
having achieved these incredible
successes on legislation,

12:45.131 --> 12:48.897
I just felt that
that's what I needed to do.

12:48.968 --> 12:50.458
It was just such a calling.

12:50.536 --> 12:54.734
I felt it so strongly that
in spite of all of the negatives

12:54.807 --> 12:56.707
that you might think,
"You can't do that.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.210
"You've got seven kids.

12:58.277 --> 12:59.921
You're going through
the middle of a divorce."

12:59.945 --> 13:03.575
Many people thought I was making
a very foolish decision.

13:06.318 --> 13:09.948
LORI de LEON:
My uncles, my aunts,

13:10.022 --> 13:12.889
our family didn't understand
why my mother

13:12.958 --> 13:14.221
would give up everything

13:14.293 --> 13:16.455
to work with farmworkers
who have nothing.

13:16.529 --> 13:20.762
I did pray that if I
was doing the wrong thing,

13:20.833 --> 13:23.803
I wanted a sign that I was doing
the wrong thing.

13:23.869 --> 13:28.067
Making this huge, huge decision
to leave my home in Stockton,

13:28.140 --> 13:31.110
to come to Delano,
not knowing where my next meal

13:31.177 --> 13:32.736
was going to be coming from.

13:32.812 --> 13:36.271
I was worried about how my kids
would be able to take the move

13:36.348 --> 13:38.214
because they left
all their friends behind

13:38.284 --> 13:40.218
and we had
a very comfortable home.

13:40.286 --> 13:43.483
I left a couple of my younger
children behind.

13:43.556 --> 13:48.323
I knew that I was doing
something that I wanted to do.

13:48.394 --> 13:49.418
They had no choice.

13:51.664 --> 13:55.066
The last thing that I did
before I went to Delano,

13:55.134 --> 13:57.899
I went to the
Monterey Jazz Festival.

13:57.970 --> 13:59.460
I always loved jazz music,

13:59.538 --> 14:02.473
and that was one of
the big sacrifices that I made

14:02.541 --> 14:05.033
when I went to Delano
because after that,

14:05.110 --> 14:07.977
I didn't hear any music for...
for years.

14:18.090 --> 14:19.819
LORI de LEON:
It was very, very sad.

14:19.892 --> 14:21.291
We went from a home

14:21.360 --> 14:22.885
where we were surrounded
by family,

14:22.962 --> 14:24.452
to Delano,

14:24.530 --> 14:25.998
first and foremost because

14:26.065 --> 14:28.830
we didn't have our mother
at that point.

14:28.901 --> 14:30.266
She was off and running.

14:30.336 --> 14:33.033
We soon recognized
that my mother

14:33.105 --> 14:34.470
really didn't belong to us.

14:46.385 --> 14:48.786
The reason for the existence
of the union

14:48.854 --> 14:50.720
is to try to get power
for the powerless.

14:50.789 --> 14:52.553
The farmworkers
don't have any power

14:52.625 --> 14:54.669
to solve any of their own
economic and social problems.

14:54.693 --> 14:57.013
You know, they're faced by
not only economic discrimination

14:57.062 --> 14:59.360
and social,
but also racial discrimination.

14:59.431 --> 15:01.525
This is true
of the Mexican farmworkers.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.864
It is of the black farmworker,
the Arabian,

15:03.936 --> 15:05.680
and sometimes even
the poor white farmworker.

15:05.704 --> 15:08.537
Cesar, what
made you pick Dolores,

15:08.607 --> 15:11.338
a woman, to help you form
the United Farm Workers?

15:11.410 --> 15:13.105
We had worked before together,

15:13.178 --> 15:16.637
and she believed as I did

15:16.715 --> 15:18.308
that this job could be done,

15:18.384 --> 15:20.011
the workers could be organized.

15:20.085 --> 15:25.023
She had the faith and the drive
and the enthusiasm.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.489
So those are
some of the reasons.

15:26.558 --> 15:30.552
The... the skills,
a lot of knowledge,

15:30.629 --> 15:34.156
and a lot of just willingness
to sacrifice.

15:38.704 --> 15:41.139
We divided the
San Joaquin Valley.

15:41.206 --> 15:43.800
Cesar took the southern half,
I took the northern half,

15:43.876 --> 15:46.641
and we did house meetings
in all the different counties.

15:46.712 --> 15:49.409
So we had all of these
committees that we organized.

15:49.481 --> 15:52.746
We had a thousand members
and we had benefits.

15:52.818 --> 15:55.150
We had a life insurance plan.

15:55.220 --> 15:57.348
We had an office,
we started a credit union,

15:57.423 --> 15:59.303
the first farmworker
credit union in the history

15:59.358 --> 16:02.726
of the United States of America,
where people could get loans.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.058
We had a cooperative store.

16:04.129 --> 16:06.154
We did services,
we did immigration work,

16:06.231 --> 16:07.665
we did their income taxes.

16:07.733 --> 16:11.033
We had a five-year plan
to have a national strike

16:11.103 --> 16:12.662
in the Central Valley

16:12.738 --> 16:16.800
because we wanted all of the
growers to negotiate together,

16:16.875 --> 16:18.604
but what disrupted that plan

16:18.677 --> 16:21.442
was when the Filipino workers
went out on strike.

16:21.513 --> 16:25.472
Because there was so much
violence against the Filipinos.

16:25.551 --> 16:28.145
They locked them in their
bunkhouses in the labor camps,

16:28.220 --> 16:30.086
they turned off the light, gas,
and the water.

16:30.155 --> 16:32.089
Some of them were beaten up.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.125
And so when these stories
came back to us,

16:34.193 --> 16:36.218
well, we thought we don't have
any option.

16:36.295 --> 16:38.286
So we joined forces
on the strike

16:38.364 --> 16:40.628
to support the Filipino workers.

That was an amazing thing

17:25.911 --> 17:28.005
for me, as a young Chicano,

17:28.079 --> 17:30.549
to suddenly come upon two people
in the field

17:30.616 --> 17:33.244
that were actually working
on a social problem

17:33.318 --> 17:35.082
that had affected my whole life.

17:35.154 --> 17:37.987
I saw them up close
and I had no problem

17:38.057 --> 17:40.025
believing that
I had to follow them.

17:40.092 --> 17:41.423
I had to become a follower.

17:41.493 --> 17:47.330
♪ Solidarity forever... ♪

17:47.399 --> 17:48.759
I was not an easy follower.

17:48.801 --> 17:50.166
I was pretty independent,

17:50.235 --> 17:52.636
but here suddenly is Cesar

17:52.704 --> 17:55.173
and here is Dolores.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.800
And I devoted all of my
energies, all of my waking hours

17:57.876 --> 17:59.435
to follow them into the cause.

18:02.147 --> 18:06.380
I too have the dream that
I learned from Dolores Huerta

18:06.452 --> 18:10.685
that farmworkers
can share in the wealth

18:10.756 --> 18:13.885
that they help to produce.

18:13.959 --> 18:15.654
She has such a firm belief

18:15.727 --> 18:18.162
in what she's doing

18:18.230 --> 18:20.995
that she infects you with it.

18:21.066 --> 18:22.363
Dolores Huerta.

18:29.608 --> 18:31.667
<i>Muchas gracias,
compafieros y compafieras.</i>

18:31.743 --> 18:34.041
Then I think
she looks deep within you

18:34.113 --> 18:36.548
and she understands
what you're capable of,

18:36.615 --> 18:38.049
that you actually can do more

18:38.117 --> 18:39.676
than what you thought
was possible.

18:40.886 --> 18:42.564
When we started
to organize farmworkers,

18:42.588 --> 18:45.250
people would say to us,
"They're poor,

18:45.324 --> 18:47.349
"they don't speak English,
they're not citizens.

18:47.426 --> 18:49.827
How are you going
to possibly organize them?"

18:49.895 --> 18:53.126
And of course the response
that we had to that is,

18:53.198 --> 18:56.691
"The power is in your body."

18:56.768 --> 18:57.929
<i>;Viva la cause!</i>

18:59.238 --> 19:00.238
<i>;Viva la huelgal.</i>

19:03.809 --> 19:06.073
One of the things that was
very helpful in the beginning

19:06.145 --> 19:07.544
was that Dolores being out there

19:07.613 --> 19:09.775
made it all right for women
to be in the picket line

19:09.848 --> 19:11.748
and so it made it all right
for the husbands

19:11.817 --> 19:13.945
to permit their wives
to be in the picket line,

19:14.019 --> 19:16.647
and their daughters,
and their mothers and so forth.

19:16.722 --> 19:19.384
We found that
it's a tremendous advantage

19:19.458 --> 19:22.792
to give women
equal participation in the union

19:22.861 --> 19:24.439
because, well, they're
tremendous resources there

19:24.463 --> 19:25.794
and they should be used.

19:25.864 --> 19:28.356
We had women
who ran the clinics.

19:28.433 --> 19:31.630
We had women as field directors.

19:31.703 --> 19:33.501
Women did a lot
of the clerical work.

19:33.572 --> 19:35.097
I remember hearing people
say to Cesar,

19:35.174 --> 19:36.539
"Why do you have so many women?"

19:36.608 --> 19:38.599
and he'd say,
"Because they do the work."

19:38.677 --> 19:40.702
Whether it be Dolores Huerta,

19:40.779 --> 19:42.042
Jessica Govea,

19:42.114 --> 19:43.411
or Helen Chavez,

19:43.482 --> 19:46.213
there were more women
involved in the UFW

19:46.285 --> 19:47.514
than probably every other

19:47.586 --> 19:50.419
labor union in the United States
combined.

19:50.489 --> 19:52.480
The one place
where we were lacking

19:52.558 --> 19:54.151
was on the executive board

19:54.226 --> 19:58.561
and for many, many years, I was
the only woman on the board.

19:58.630 --> 20:00.275
Cesar, you represent a culture

20:00.299 --> 20:02.597
that says the woman must be
protected at all costs,

20:02.668 --> 20:04.864
yet you take Dolores
right out in the picket line,

20:04.937 --> 20:06.063
into a demonstration.

20:06.138 --> 20:07.970
Do you ever worry
about her life?

20:08.040 --> 20:09.906
We worry, sure.

20:09.975 --> 20:12.637
There are some situations
that are very dangerous,

20:12.711 --> 20:15.408
but she's a leader of the union

20:15.480 --> 20:17.280
and those are the risks
that have to be taken.

20:18.383 --> 20:20.875
These were not small farmers.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.318
This was agribusiness,

20:22.387 --> 20:26.324
and the growers were tied
into local government

20:26.391 --> 20:29.361
and have control
of local sheriffs.

20:29.428 --> 20:32.728
So when we would go
on a picket line,

20:32.798 --> 20:36.666
the sheriffs would not hesitate
to beat somebody.

20:36.735 --> 20:40.569
The contractors or the foremen
or some of the tractor workers

20:40.639 --> 20:44.473
wouldn't hesitate
to run over a striker.

20:46.178 --> 20:48.613
I know of no grower
in the Delano area

20:48.680 --> 20:52.617
who has refused
or who would refuse

20:52.684 --> 20:57.520
to sit down and to talk
with the workers on his farm.

20:57.589 --> 20:59.489
But not with the
union organization.

20:59.558 --> 21:03.119
But they do not feel that
the organizer and the agitators

21:03.195 --> 21:04.959
represent their workers.

21:05.030 --> 21:10.093
We had been on strike
since September of 1965,

21:10.168 --> 21:11.465
and at the beginning,

21:11.536 --> 21:13.561
we had a lot of people
that brought donations,

21:13.639 --> 21:15.664
contributions
to keep the strike going,

21:15.741 --> 21:18.938
but as the months went on,
it was tapering off.

21:19.011 --> 21:21.605
So we knew we had to do
something different

21:21.680 --> 21:23.512
and that's when we came up
with the idea

21:23.582 --> 21:24.947
of doing the march
to Sacramento.

21:27.753 --> 21:30.085
The strikers
and their supporters

21:30.155 --> 21:31.623
is beyond question

21:31.690 --> 21:33.590
the largest and the most
significant gathering

21:33.659 --> 21:36.390
on behalf of the farmworkers
in California history.

21:39.631 --> 21:42.328
Along the march she
negotiated the Schenley contract,

21:42.401 --> 21:44.802
which was the first contract
in history

21:44.870 --> 21:50.001
between farmworkers
and the growers.

21:50.075 --> 21:53.045
Labor history has been made here
in California today,

21:53.111 --> 21:54.875
an agreement between

21:54.946 --> 21:56.880
the National Farm Workers
Association

21:56.948 --> 22:00.248
and the Schenley Industries
Corporation.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.447
Dolores Huerta negotiated

22:02.521 --> 22:04.148
my grandfather's
first union contract,

22:04.222 --> 22:07.715
and it was because of Dolores's
work that my grandpa was able

22:07.793 --> 22:11.457
to get water in the workplace.
Drinking water, toilets.

22:11.530 --> 22:14.295
LORI de LEON:
And her being a young Chicana,

22:14.366 --> 22:16.130
sitting at the table
facing the growers

22:16.201 --> 22:19.637
with farmworkers who were
primarily just Spanish-speaking,

22:19.705 --> 22:21.503
some of them illiterate,

22:21.573 --> 22:25.840
stayed with me throughout
my life how individuals,

22:25.911 --> 22:28.903
whether they can read, write,
or speak English or not,

22:28.980 --> 22:32.109
have individual power.

22:37.356 --> 22:40.917
If the rules
to settle our economic problems

22:40.992 --> 22:42.255
are not forthcoming,

22:42.327 --> 22:44.819
we will take economic pressures,

22:44.896 --> 22:47.194
strike, boycott,

22:47.265 --> 22:50.599
to force recognition and obtain
collective bargaining rights.

22:50.669 --> 22:54.105
The social and economic
revolution of the farmworkers

22:54.172 --> 22:55.640
is well underway,

22:55.707 --> 22:59.473
and it will not be stopped
until we receive equality.

22:59.544 --> 23:03.139
If Dolores
Huerta and Cesar Chavez

23:03.215 --> 23:06.014
felt it was possible

23:06.084 --> 23:07.848
to organize farmworkers

23:07.919 --> 23:12.117
when no one believed
that that was possible,

23:12.190 --> 23:13.316
it was because

23:13.392 --> 23:16.487
many of us during that period

23:16.561 --> 23:19.587
were totally convinced
that we could change the world.

23:19.664 --> 23:22.531
We were persuaded

23:22.601 --> 23:24.968
that revolutionary change
was possible.

The civil rights movement
was going on,

the peace movement was going on,

the feminist movement

It was electric, especially
when you walked past the fields

It became really
apparent that the racism

24:31.570 --> 24:32.980
that touches black people
is no different

24:33.004 --> 24:35.098
than the racism that touches
the other groups,

24:35.173 --> 24:36.918
and so we were really marching
for everybody.

24:36.942 --> 24:39.673
We were marching
for social change.

24:39.744 --> 24:43.806
Oftentimes today looking back,

24:43.882 --> 24:46.180
we think about discrete
and distinct movements.

24:46.251 --> 24:48.196
We think that the black movement
was one movement,

24:48.220 --> 24:50.018
and then the Chicano movement
was over here,

24:50.088 --> 24:52.716
and then there was
the Native American movement.

24:52.791 --> 24:54.190
But all of those movements,

24:54.259 --> 24:56.819
and the individuals
within those movements,

24:56.895 --> 25:00.593
were connected,
and we knew that one movement

25:00.665 --> 25:03.635
would not be successful
without the other.

25:03.702 --> 25:07.195
Today we talk about the
intersectionality of struggles,

25:07.272 --> 25:10.640
but I think during that period
we actually lived it.

25:10.709 --> 25:12.507
We experienced it.

25:12.577 --> 25:15.308
If you remain truly nonviolent,

25:15.380 --> 25:17.747
and I'm pledging my support...

25:17.816 --> 25:20.786
We come today
to lend our moral support,

25:20.852 --> 25:22.547
our fiscal support,

25:22.621 --> 25:23.918
and our financial support

25:23.989 --> 25:26.321
to the efforts of Cesar Chavez.

25:28.126 --> 25:30.561
There was a
lot of passion in all of us

25:30.629 --> 25:32.119
for what we were doing.

25:32.197 --> 25:34.188
I mean, we were making
five dollars a week

25:34.266 --> 25:35.495
in terms of salary, right?

25:35.567 --> 25:39.197
That was more than just the
union not having the resources.

25:39.271 --> 25:41.035
It didn't.

25:41.106 --> 25:44.406
It was also because there was
no way you could pay people

25:44.476 --> 25:45.773
to work seven days a week.

25:45.844 --> 25:48.279
You know,
it had to come from your heart.

25:48.346 --> 25:51.441
I remember
Dolores calling and saying,

25:51.516 --> 25:53.041
"Well, why don't you
come work for us?"

25:53.118 --> 25:54.643
I said, "Well, how much
does it pay?"

25:54.719 --> 25:57.086
"Five dollars a week
and all you can eat."

25:57.155 --> 25:59.487
I said, "I don't think my father
will appreciate that"

25:59.558 --> 26:01.424
"having helped me get through
law school

26:01.493 --> 26:03.894
and going back
to where they left."

26:03.962 --> 26:06.488
And of course, I said yes.

26:06.565 --> 26:10.126
And my father was angry because
he thought it was regressive.

26:10.201 --> 26:14.331
In reality,
it was a most trans...

26:14.406 --> 26:16.966
(voice breaking}: Formative
period in my life.

26:24.916 --> 26:27.817
We wish to welcome you
to Delano.

26:27.886 --> 26:30.355
You know, and I don't
have to tell you this,

26:30.422 --> 26:33.915
how thankful we are for the
gifts that you have brought us.

26:33.992 --> 26:37.895
You also know that the gifts
of food and clothing

26:37.963 --> 26:41.991
are the things that will keep us
alive for the next few months.

26:42.067 --> 26:44.229
Dolores, if someone just came in

26:44.302 --> 26:45.895
and put $5,000 in your lap

26:45.971 --> 26:48.211
and said, "I want you to spend
this totally on yourself",

26:48.239 --> 26:50.765
Dolores, nobody else,"
what would you do with it?

26:50.842 --> 26:53.903
Well, I would...

26:53.979 --> 26:55.723
I'd turn around
and contribute it to the union.

26:55.747 --> 26:57.215
That's what I would do.

26:57.282 --> 26:58.613
No fair.

26:58.683 --> 27:00.227
Because that would be spending
it on myself,

27:00.251 --> 27:01.980
because to me,
this is my life's work.

27:02.053 --> 27:04.954
To me, you know,
this is the reason I live.

27:05.023 --> 27:07.720
But don't you ever have
the average woman's dream

27:07.792 --> 27:11.126
of going out to some spa,
and being relaxed,

27:11.196 --> 27:13.358
and having a new hairdo,
and buying a great dress,

27:13.431 --> 27:15.263
and having a big party?

27:15.333 --> 27:20.169
Well, to me, having a hairdo
and being in a spa

27:20.238 --> 27:22.138
would be a terrible
waste of time.

27:25.210 --> 27:28.271
My uncle,
Cesar Chavez, and my mother

27:28.346 --> 27:32.112
were both greatly influenced
by the philosophies of Gandhi.

27:32.183 --> 27:34.948
You can't help people
unless you live like them.

27:35.020 --> 27:37.512
So, we're not going to be able
to help organize farmworkers

27:37.589 --> 27:39.455
unless we live
like the farmworkers.

27:39.524 --> 27:42.789
My mother and Cesar
ingrained themselves in the community

27:42.861 --> 27:44.761
and they lived
in those communities.

27:44.829 --> 27:46.923
They didn't fly in
from Washington or San Francisco

27:46.998 --> 27:48.776
or L.A. to say, "We know it all
and we're going"

27:48.800 --> 27:51.201
to teach you guys
how to build a union."

27:51.269 --> 27:53.931
They said, "We need to build
an association"

27:54.005 --> 27:57.805
that addresses the day-to-day
needs of folks.

28:00.145 --> 28:02.807
I only knew growing up

28:02.881 --> 28:05.509
that when we were poor,
because we were,

28:05.583 --> 28:08.553
my mom would always tell us,
"You're poor by choice."

28:08.620 --> 28:11.817
We have a tendency to want to be
too comfortable, you know.

28:11.890 --> 28:14.484
And I'm trying to educate
my children

28:14.559 --> 28:16.357
in the way that I'm raising them

28:16.428 --> 28:18.487
to give their lives
to work for other people.

28:18.563 --> 28:21.191
And I'm hoping that
out of the 11 that I've got,

28:21.266 --> 28:23.428
I sure ought to come out
with a pretty good percentage.

28:23.501 --> 28:25.128
We didn't get it at the time,

28:25.203 --> 28:27.729
the lessons that she was trying
to teach us and, in fact,

28:27.806 --> 28:29.399
we were like most teenagers,

28:29.474 --> 28:31.966
rebellious and angry

28:32.043 --> 28:34.478
about her ideas of materialism.

28:34.546 --> 28:37.846
Our biggest dream was just to be
like the kids at school

28:37.916 --> 28:39.645
who had all the latest fashions,

28:39.718 --> 28:42.881
but we didn't get
any of that stuff.

28:42.954 --> 28:44.922
So we knew we were outside
of the norm for sure.

28:44.989 --> 28:46.548
Why are you here today?

28:46.624 --> 28:49.423
Because I don't like the people
that are here in our town,

28:49.494 --> 28:50.984
they don't belong here,

28:51.062 --> 28:53.074
and I wish they'd all go back
to where they came from.

28:53.098 --> 28:54.775
Now, which people are these
you're talking about?

28:54.799 --> 28:58.030
I'm talking about the outsiders
that have come into this strike

28:58.103 --> 29:01.129
and have interfered
with our daily workers.

29:01.206 --> 29:05.074
Our workers are loyal workers
and they work out in the fields

29:05.143 --> 29:06.804
and yet they are harassed.

29:06.878 --> 29:08.505
They're insulted.

29:08.580 --> 29:09.843
We've had no trouble.

29:09.914 --> 29:11.882
Well, now, are you unhappy
at the labor troubles?

29:11.950 --> 29:14.078
We had no labor troubles!

29:29.167 --> 29:32.865
Senator Kennedy
actively gave his backing

29:32.937 --> 29:35.463
to the unionization campaign.

29:35.540 --> 29:37.065
I think people are frustrated,

29:37.142 --> 29:40.043
and I think they're terribly
disturbed by the fact

29:40.111 --> 29:42.102
that they haven't had
more success,

29:42.180 --> 29:44.080
and that the federal government
in Washington

29:44.149 --> 29:46.550
has not been helpful to them,

29:46.618 --> 29:49.883
and that the state
has not been helpful to them.

29:49.954 --> 29:53.015
I remember my grandpa
telling me how important it was

29:53.091 --> 29:55.321
to the Latino community here
in California

29:55.393 --> 29:58.920
that Robert Kennedy came in
and stood with them

29:58.997 --> 30:01.022
when the sheriff
and police department

30:01.099 --> 30:05.536
were actually arresting these
people for doing lawful things.

30:05.603 --> 30:07.071
If I have reason to believe

30:07.138 --> 30:08.936
that there's going to be
a riot started

30:09.007 --> 30:11.271
and somebody tells me
that there's going to be trouble

30:11.342 --> 30:13.538
if you don't stop them,
then it's my duty to stop them.

30:13.611 --> 30:15.739
Then you go out and arrest them?

30:15.814 --> 30:16.975
Absolutely.

30:17.048 --> 30:18.345
How can you go arrest somebody

30:18.416 --> 30:20.248
if they haven't
violated the law?

30:20.318 --> 30:21.752
They're ready
to violate the law.

30:21.820 --> 30:22.981
In other words...

30:26.257 --> 30:28.555
Could I suggest in the interim
period of time,

30:28.626 --> 30:30.025
in the luncheon period of time,

30:30.094 --> 30:32.119
that the sheriff
and the district attorney

30:32.197 --> 30:34.962
read the Constitution
of the United States?

30:37.769 --> 30:39.079
To see this Harvard-educated guy

30:39.103 --> 30:42.232
from Massachusetts
talk in a funny accent,

30:42.307 --> 30:44.639
stand with us,
it meant something.

30:44.709 --> 30:49.237
You can't imagine a
political figure of that station

30:49.314 --> 30:54.252
these days going after
corporations with that vigor.

30:54.319 --> 30:55.480
For who?

30:55.553 --> 30:57.078
Not for his own.

30:57.155 --> 30:58.589
Not even on his coast.

30:58.656 --> 30:59.817
Wow, right?

30:59.891 --> 31:02.053
We have somebody
of national prominence

31:02.126 --> 31:03.594
who knows who we are,

31:03.661 --> 31:06.961
and who's running for president
and has a chance to win.

31:07.031 --> 31:10.365
We all went and worked on his
campaign throughout the state.

31:10.435 --> 31:12.335
The farmworkers pioneered

31:12.403 --> 31:14.735
a voter outreach strategy
to Latino voters

31:14.806 --> 31:18.401
that had never been done before
anywhere in the United States.

31:18.476 --> 31:21.104
Labor's idea of mobilizing
for an election

31:21.179 --> 31:23.511
was to write a check
to the local Democrat.

31:23.581 --> 31:25.982
It was the farmworker folks
in California

31:26.050 --> 31:28.781
who were knocking on doors,
persuading them to vote,

31:28.853 --> 31:30.685
registering them at the door,

31:30.755 --> 31:32.723
all the things
Democrats nationally

31:32.790 --> 31:33.951
are dependent on today.

31:34.025 --> 31:36.255
There were hundreds of us.

31:36.327 --> 31:38.728
Every door we knocked on,
we knew we were going to win.

31:38.796 --> 31:39.956
You could just taste victory.

31:45.169 --> 31:48.605
We came back for the party
and we had the TV set up

31:48.673 --> 31:51.301
and, you know, I could see my
mother on the television screen

31:51.376 --> 31:53.970
next to Kennedy and him
acknowledging the farmworkers.

31:54.045 --> 31:57.675
For them and all of those
Mexican-Americans

31:57.749 --> 32:00.184
who were such supporters
of mine.

32:01.653 --> 32:04.122
And Dolores Huerta,
who is an old friend of mine,

32:04.188 --> 32:05.622
and who is working
with the union,

32:05.690 --> 32:07.749
to thank her and tell her
how much I appreciate

32:07.825 --> 32:09.224
her coming tonight.

32:09.294 --> 32:11.524
We have certain obligations
and responsibilities

32:11.596 --> 32:14.361
to our fellow citizens,
which we talked about

32:14.432 --> 32:16.127
during the course
of this campaign.

32:16.200 --> 32:18.100
And I want to make it clear

32:18.169 --> 32:19.914
that if I'm elected president
of the United States,

32:19.938 --> 32:22.066
with your help,
I intend to keep them.

32:25.543 --> 32:27.773
Now it's on to Chicago,
and let's win there.

32:27.845 --> 32:29.176
Thank you very much.

33:16.728 --> 33:21.791
I had never before
experienced the death of the future.

33:21.866 --> 33:23.493
The death of the past, yes,

33:23.568 --> 33:27.527
but when the future dies,
it's different.

33:32.744 --> 33:34.007
All this hope,

33:34.078 --> 33:35.978
the one person
that would actually

33:36.047 --> 33:38.345
stand up for us is gone.

33:42.587 --> 33:45.887
Some people became very cynical
after Robert Kennedy was killed,

33:45.957 --> 33:49.222
but we had to continue
to keep on working for justice

33:49.293 --> 33:51.819
and nonviolence because

33:51.896 --> 33:55.332
that's what Robert Kennedy
would have wanted us to do.

33:56.901 --> 33:59.836
Dolores was the
closest one to Senator Kennedy,

33:59.904 --> 34:04.569
and having been witness to
something as terrifying as that

34:04.642 --> 34:10.842
made her understanding of
nonviolence even more important,

34:10.915 --> 34:16.478
because she saw firsthand the
impact that violence can have.

34:18.389 --> 34:22.121
Hatred and racism
are extensions of violence,

34:22.193 --> 34:25.686
and if we become that which
we are trying to end,

34:25.763 --> 34:28.322
then you know, we are becoming
like the oppressor then,

34:28.399 --> 34:30.833
and we're trying to set up
a different system.

34:50.288 --> 34:52.085
To talk about grapes and lettuce

34:52.156 --> 34:54.123
produced in poverty
and suffering

34:54.192 --> 34:56.456
felt like the first step.

34:56.527 --> 35:00.225
An additional step was
to talk about grapes and lettuce

35:00.298 --> 35:01.663
produced in poisons.

35:03.334 --> 35:05.701
And 90,000 people
were poisoned last year.

35:05.770 --> 35:08.398
A thousand people
were killed last year.

35:08.473 --> 35:11.443
And then people say,
"Where at? In Vietnam?"

35:11.509 --> 35:14.103
And I say, "No, in the fields of
the United States of America."

35:14.178 --> 35:18.172
The pesticides that
were sprayed in those fields,

35:18.249 --> 35:19.410
we never knew what it was

35:19.484 --> 35:22.112
and there were so many times

35:22.186 --> 35:23.745
we wound up
stumbling out of the fields

35:23.821 --> 35:27.519
because our eyes were watering,
our skin was irritated.

35:27.592 --> 35:32.189
You could just see the splotches
on your skin.

35:32.263 --> 35:34.493
It's toxic.

35:34.565 --> 35:37.193
It's poisonous and people die.

35:40.371 --> 35:44.001
Earlimart, McFarland, Delano,
all those areas

35:44.075 --> 35:47.170
have been affected by the use
of pesticides since World War II

35:47.245 --> 35:49.213
and they become cancer clusters,

35:49.280 --> 35:52.341
little kids born with limbs
that are misshapen.

35:52.416 --> 35:56.011
They don't have them, you know?

35:56.087 --> 35:58.749
This is the unspeakable stuff
that the United Farm Workers

35:58.823 --> 36:00.882
tried to fight against.

36:00.958 --> 36:05.623
The farmworkers
were a living daily reminder

36:05.696 --> 36:08.324
and warning system

36:08.399 --> 36:12.632
of what everyone
was going to experience.

36:12.703 --> 36:14.762
What appeal would
you make to a consumer,

36:14.839 --> 36:18.742
you know, a mother who's
concerned about her children?

36:18.809 --> 36:20.420
This is
definitely a flag to them

36:20.444 --> 36:22.003
to say there's something wrong

36:22.079 --> 36:24.707
with the poisons that are on our
food that they eat every day.

36:27.351 --> 36:30.514
Well, we have the many cases,
many affidavits of cases

36:30.588 --> 36:33.387
where workers have been poisoned
by pesticides,

36:33.457 --> 36:34.737
where they have
serious illnesses

36:34.792 --> 36:38.592
and also there's, of course,
many reports of deaths

36:38.663 --> 36:40.631
that have been caused
by pesticides.

36:40.698 --> 36:43.531
But isn't that just
sort of an occupational hazard?

36:43.601 --> 36:45.626
Is there anything
that can be done about it?

36:45.703 --> 36:48.263
Well, we believe that something
can be done about this

36:48.339 --> 36:50.433
but, of course,
in order to do this

36:50.508 --> 36:52.567
we have to have the cooperation
of the employers.

36:52.643 --> 36:57.809
In the 19605, labor
was seen as anti-environmental.

36:57.882 --> 37:02.046
Well, here's the farmworkers
in the vanguard.

37:02.119 --> 37:03.245
They won.

37:03.321 --> 37:05.653
They got DDT banned.

37:05.723 --> 37:09.182
They founded the whole idea
of environmental justice.

37:09.260 --> 37:11.456
Older environmental groups

37:11.529 --> 37:14.362
often were concerned
with the redwoods,

37:14.432 --> 37:17.333
they were concerned
with the trees, not the people.

37:17.401 --> 37:21.702
It was Dolores, among others,
who made this linkage

37:21.772 --> 37:26.369
by making people
look at the human cost.

37:26.444 --> 37:27.754
The environmental
justice movement

37:27.778 --> 37:29.371
said that certain
environmental hazards

37:29.447 --> 37:31.677
are disproportionately impacted
on people of color.

37:31.749 --> 37:34.184
That would never be allowed
if these people

37:34.252 --> 37:35.583
were white middle class.

37:35.653 --> 37:38.315
So it wasn't simply
stopping DDT,

37:38.389 --> 37:40.084
but it was also making
the larger point

37:40.157 --> 37:42.626
you're only allowing this
because of who the workers are

37:42.693 --> 37:45.856
and their racial and class
background.

37:52.270 --> 37:56.867
The farmworker movement in
many ways was a cultural revolution

37:56.941 --> 37:59.967
because when people saw the
farmworkers come out on strike

38:00.044 --> 38:01.512
and go on those marches,

38:01.579 --> 38:03.513
I think that it really
said to people

38:03.581 --> 38:06.607
if the farmworkers can do this,
so can we.

38:06.684 --> 38:11.588
It gave our Latino people a
certain pride in who they were.

38:11.656 --> 38:16.822
We are Indio, Mestigo,
Hispano, Mexicano.

38:16.894 --> 38:20.262
The names have all been changed
across the centuries,

38:20.331 --> 38:22.698
but they all mean
the same thing.

38:22.767 --> 38:26.931
We have been Americanos
longer than America has existed.

38:27.004 --> 38:29.268
We are Aztlén!

39:07.345 --> 39:10.076
<i>♪ Oye coma va ♪</i>

39:10.147 --> 39:11.308
<i>♪ Mi ritmo ♪</i>

39:11.382 --> 39:13.316
<i>♪ Bueno pa gozar' ♪</i>

39:13.384 --> 39:15.045
<i>♪ Mulata' ♪</i>

39:20.224 --> 39:22.989
First time I
opened up Time magazine,

39:23.060 --> 39:25.688
a little picture of a march

39:25.763 --> 39:28.596
and all the people out there
looked like me.

39:28.666 --> 39:31.533
That first impact was huge.

39:31.602 --> 39:34.594
So, the farmworker movement
was a catalyst

39:34.672 --> 39:39.508
and ignited a personal and
community-wide self-evaluation

39:39.577 --> 39:41.739
of who we were as a people.

39:41.812 --> 39:43.623
Yeah, I can
remember seeing those marches,

39:43.647 --> 39:45.809
and it was kind of amazing
for a brown boy

39:45.883 --> 39:50.320
to see a bunch of brown people
in the United States

39:50.388 --> 39:53.119
marching in simultaneity
about something.

39:53.190 --> 39:57.320
As a Latino kid, the pressure
to assimilate was great.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.989
Seeing women like Dolores Huerta
out there

40:00.064 --> 40:02.158
gave me an example
as a young brown kid

40:02.233 --> 40:04.065
to be able to engage in a way

40:04.135 --> 40:07.002
that's not white,
that was actually particular

40:07.071 --> 40:08.766
to us as brown people
in this country.

40:46.010 --> 40:48.001
Even though I grew up

40:48.078 --> 40:49.944
in such this strong
Chicano movement,

40:50.014 --> 40:53.279
the television
and all of the media messages

40:53.350 --> 40:55.785
told me everything the opposite,

40:55.853 --> 41:00.882
that brown was ugly,
being poor was bad.

41:03.594 --> 41:06.723
She knew that we were
going to be experiencing persecution

41:06.797 --> 41:08.526
based on the color of our skin

41:08.599 --> 41:10.260
and so she was constantly
telling us

41:10.334 --> 41:13.304
how beautiful our dark skin was.

41:13.370 --> 41:15.600
In high school,
I started talking about,

41:15.673 --> 41:17.163
"I want a nose job
for graduation.

41:17.241 --> 41:19.121
That's what I want
my graduation present to be,"

41:19.176 --> 41:22.009
as if we could afford that,
but that was my thing.

41:22.079 --> 41:23.012
I wanted a nose job.

41:23.080 --> 41:25.549
She was like, "Over my dead body"

41:25.616 --> 41:28.711
"will you ever reconstruct
that beautiful nose

41:28.786 --> 41:30.754
"that God and your ancestors,

41:30.821 --> 41:32.915
"your Tarahumara tribe
has given you.

41:32.990 --> 41:35.084
You will not touch that nose
ever."

41:39.897 --> 41:41.524
Revolution starts

41:41.599 --> 41:44.466
with self-love in the sense

41:44.535 --> 41:46.246
that if you're a member
of an oppressed people,

41:46.270 --> 41:50.264
an oppressed class, you have
to develop self-respect,

41:50.341 --> 41:54.835
and that starts by developing
some affection for who you are.

41:59.049 --> 42:01.177
You love your family
and you say,

42:01.252 --> 42:03.949
"Okay, but why does the world
regard them as inferior?

42:04.021 --> 42:06.285
"Why does the world regard them
as ugly when, in my eyes,

42:06.357 --> 42:09.884
they're quite beautiful?"

42:09.960 --> 42:14.830
Movements not only affect laws,

42:14.899 --> 42:18.563
they also affect
the way people feel.

42:18.636 --> 42:20.866
They affect emotions.

42:25.042 --> 42:26.753
Well, then, is
this more a social movement?

42:26.777 --> 42:28.575
It's both.
You can't separate it.

42:28.646 --> 42:31.274
It's both a labor movement
and a social movement

42:31.348 --> 42:32.611
or you can say it another way.

42:32.683 --> 42:34.310
I think all of
the labor movement

42:34.385 --> 42:35.910
has also been a social movement.

42:40.324 --> 42:42.520
This might sound kind of corny,

42:42.593 --> 42:46.223
but you have to really
love people, you know,

42:46.297 --> 42:48.356
to want to teach them,

42:48.432 --> 42:50.025
to want to have them grow.

42:50.100 --> 42:52.312
Because you're giving a lot of
yourself when you're doing that.

42:52.336 --> 42:55.271
It's not just filling out the
form and filling out the paper.

42:55.339 --> 42:57.099
When a farmworker comes in
with this problem,

42:57.141 --> 42:58.802
and then you're going to start
telling him

42:58.876 --> 43:01.277
the history of his abuse
and start getting him angry,

43:01.345 --> 43:03.507
that's going to take something
out of you right there,

43:03.581 --> 43:05.777
you know?

43:05.849 --> 43:08.079
She was so
dedicated to the work,

43:08.152 --> 43:11.713
like a workaholic,
that she felt guilty

43:11.789 --> 43:15.817
taking time
to enjoy life herself.

43:15.893 --> 43:19.523
So going to a jazz concert,
music, dance,

43:19.597 --> 43:22.032
which was her passion,

43:22.099 --> 43:24.693
she felt very guilty
about doing those things

43:24.768 --> 43:27.897
and she said that
it was my dad, Richard,

43:27.972 --> 43:30.066
who actually helped her

43:30.140 --> 43:33.303
look at life
a little bit differently.

43:33.377 --> 43:36.438
Richard was very good
to the kids in the family.

43:36.513 --> 43:39.813
He had a very loving nature.

43:39.883 --> 43:41.428
Of course, I wouldn't say
Richard was a feminist,

43:41.452 --> 43:43.750
but Richard was a great cook.

43:45.189 --> 43:47.886
We consider you part of us,
and us part of you.

43:47.958 --> 43:50.450
You brought Dolores
along to organize the union

43:50.527 --> 43:52.825
and to be a business partner

43:52.896 --> 43:55.263
and now she's living with
your brother, so it's family.

43:55.332 --> 43:56.493
Were you expecting that?

43:56.567 --> 43:58.535
No, I certainly wasn't.

43:58.602 --> 43:59.831
No.

43:59.903 --> 44:01.894
Life is all an accident,
you know?

44:01.972 --> 44:04.998
Sometimes those things
can't be foreseen.

44:07.478 --> 44:11.108
When my mother and my
father, Richard Chavez, got together,

44:11.181 --> 44:14.742
my father was still married
to another woman.

44:14.818 --> 44:16.115
And, of course,

44:16.186 --> 44:17.813
this is my version
that I like to believe

44:17.888 --> 44:20.186
to make myself feel better
as a love child.

44:21.992 --> 44:24.893
I've been called a bastard
by some,

44:24.962 --> 44:28.364
but I believe that my father
was in an unhappy marriage.

44:28.432 --> 44:31.561
At some point, my father
couldn't be there anymore.

44:31.635 --> 44:32.796
He met the love of his life.

44:32.870 --> 44:34.235
I don't know what happened.

44:34.304 --> 44:35.430
I wasn't there.

44:35.506 --> 44:37.031
I was just conceived.

44:37.107 --> 44:39.439
And of course, I didn't start
learning this stuff

44:39.510 --> 44:42.445
until we were older,
but there was always kind of

44:42.513 --> 44:44.481
a negative feeling
against my mom.

44:46.316 --> 44:49.513
What particularly
about Dolores upsets people?

44:49.586 --> 44:52.612
Well, it's her personal life,

44:52.690 --> 44:54.010
all the children
without marriage,

44:54.058 --> 44:57.221
and just one every year or so
is not accepted,

44:57.294 --> 45:02.164
and I think most of us
feel the same way.

45:02.232 --> 45:07.170
She did put up
with a lot of ridicule from people

45:07.237 --> 45:10.696
who wanted to see her
in a more traditional role,

45:10.774 --> 45:14.608
by the men who were threatened
by her power

45:14.678 --> 45:16.442
and her assertiveness.

45:16.513 --> 45:19.813
She cries, you know,
she rolls down the tears,

45:19.883 --> 45:22.079
you know,
and I'm all for the Chicano

45:22.152 --> 45:23.745
and all that
and like it's a joke.

45:23.821 --> 45:25.255
Like everybody knows
that the UFW,

45:25.322 --> 45:26.915
that's why they keep her
in Sacramento,

45:26.990 --> 45:28.719
and that's why they keep her
in Washington,

45:28.792 --> 45:30.089
keep them out of their hair,

45:30.160 --> 45:33.323
because she just likes to talk
a hell of a lot.

45:33.397 --> 45:34.674
While you guys are trying
to stop the money,

45:34.698 --> 45:36.097
we have to keep a lot going.

45:36.166 --> 45:39.397
How do you answer
the criticism of detractors

45:39.470 --> 45:41.939
who say that you have been
married and divorced twice,

45:42.005 --> 45:44.633
that you have 11 children
sprinkled over two marriages,

45:44.708 --> 45:46.938
and one relationship
with Richard Chavez,

45:47.010 --> 45:48.478
to whom you're not married?

45:48.545 --> 45:52.413
I guess there's not much
of an answer I can give to that.

45:52.483 --> 45:55.248
You know, I could probably say,
"Well, maybe I shouldn't

45:55.319 --> 45:57.515
have had the children,"
but I don't believe that.

45:57.588 --> 46:00.421
I think that a relationship
should bear children.

46:00.491 --> 46:03.517
Now, the thing is,
who maintains these kids?

46:03.594 --> 46:05.119
Who takes care of them?

46:05.195 --> 46:08.426
Who supports them if she's out
on these adventures?

46:08.499 --> 46:10.695
We were told...
Remember in the beginning,

46:10.768 --> 46:12.361
one of the criticisms was that,

46:12.436 --> 46:14.180
"You don't know what
you're doing to your families.

46:14.204 --> 46:16.070
"When they grow up,
they're going to disown you

46:16.140 --> 46:18.418
"and they'll really hate you
because you're not giving them

46:18.442 --> 46:21.878
the things that ordinary
children would like to have."

46:21.945 --> 46:24.209
Do you think the
children ever resent you

46:24.281 --> 46:26.443
because you're always so busy
with the organization?

46:26.517 --> 46:28.884
Oh definitely, they wouldn't be
human if they didn't.

46:28.952 --> 46:32.286
Of course, that lends
for a lot of friction,

46:32.356 --> 46:34.882
which, you know,
we always have to work out.

46:34.958 --> 46:37.427
The hardest thing for my
children has been the absences.

46:43.667 --> 46:46.364
LORI de LEON:
She was always gone.

46:46.436 --> 46:47.995
It wasn't a 9-to-5 job.

46:48.071 --> 46:50.267
She was, you know,
gone before we got up.

46:50.340 --> 46:52.672
We'd have to get ourselves ready
to go to school

46:52.743 --> 46:55.075
and try to find something
to eat.

46:56.980 --> 47:00.314
A lot of my mom's absences
had some positives and negatives.

47:00.384 --> 47:02.328
I dropped out of high school
and my mom didn't find out

47:02.352 --> 47:05.253
until ten months later,
you know, so.

47:11.094 --> 47:13.392
We were spending the night
in people's homes

47:13.463 --> 47:14.988
that we didn't know.

47:15.065 --> 47:18.467
We were going to labor camps
and not knowing if somebody

47:18.535 --> 47:21.300
was going to shoot at us,
as they did many times.

47:24.842 --> 47:28.301
It was very hard,
<i>I'll</i> be honest with you.

47:28.378 --> 47:30.608
Tough.

47:30.681 --> 47:35.243
LORI de LEON: The movement
became her most important child.

47:35.319 --> 47:37.845
I realize the importance
of the work,

47:37.921 --> 47:41.016
but I was also
very jealous of it.

47:41.091 --> 47:44.152
So... there's scars there.

47:44.228 --> 47:46.629
You know, there's scars there
because of that.

47:50.734 --> 47:52.412
When she was
around, we were just like

47:52.436 --> 47:54.598
soaking in as much
as we could of her

47:54.671 --> 47:56.935
because we just knew
she was going to be gone again.

48:00.477 --> 48:03.003
It was really difficult.

48:13.690 --> 48:17.991
It was really difficult
not to have my mom around,

48:18.061 --> 48:20.393
especially when you would see
your friends

48:20.464 --> 48:24.264
and how involved
their mothers were.

48:24.334 --> 48:28.635
There's something about
a mother's love, you know,

48:28.705 --> 48:29.934
and attention.

48:30.007 --> 48:31.406
So it was hard.

48:31.475 --> 48:35.503
There were a lot of very
difficult nights...

48:35.579 --> 48:37.172
and months.

48:39.249 --> 48:41.650
I lived
with a woman in Bakersfield

48:41.718 --> 48:44.278
for a few years
while my mom went to New York,

48:44.354 --> 48:46.755
but when my mom
came back for me,

48:46.823 --> 48:48.222
I didn't want to go with her

48:48.292 --> 48:51.159
because I liked my new home.

48:51.228 --> 48:52.593
There was stability.

48:52.663 --> 48:55.826
I had meals every time
I was supposed to have a meal.

48:55.899 --> 48:58.061
I mean eventually,
I did go back with her,

48:58.135 --> 48:59.796
but I remember crying
and feeling like,

48:59.870 --> 49:02.362
"This was my new home,"
you know.

49:02.439 --> 49:08.003
And then getting older and being
like, "Why was I left there?"

49:08.078 --> 49:11.673
Obviously, that has an impact
on a child's psyche.

49:13.483 --> 49:16.248
You know, but as I look back
at it, I'm like I understand it.

49:16.320 --> 49:18.084
I fully understand it.

49:18.155 --> 49:20.487
You know, it's like I know
there's brothers and sisters

49:20.557 --> 49:25.290
that have the same experiences,
but maybe they weren't so lucky

49:25.362 --> 49:29.230
to be placed in a loving home.

49:29.299 --> 49:32.997
You know, but that's part
of the sacrifice...

49:33.070 --> 49:35.698
That we
made and that we had to make.

49:41.712 --> 49:44.409
And we've all learned
that we're not afraid to struggle,

49:44.481 --> 49:46.279
we're not afraid to sacrifice,

49:46.350 --> 49:48.910
because you can't make change
if you're not willing

49:48.986 --> 49:50.249
to give something up.

49:50.320 --> 49:52.152
You've got to give up
some comfort.

49:52.222 --> 49:54.213
You've got to give up some time,

49:54.291 --> 49:56.385
and then we can see
the changes come.

49:57.794 --> 50:00.161
Not every woman is going
to take the kind of risks

50:00.230 --> 50:01.459
that I took with my children,

50:01.531 --> 50:03.226
you know,
what they had to go through,

50:03.300 --> 50:05.667
and I wouldn't really
want to wish it on any child

50:05.736 --> 50:07.329
or on any other woman.

50:07.404 --> 50:10.965
What I did in terms
of sacrificing my children,

50:11.041 --> 50:13.009
I know it was very painful
for them,

50:13.076 --> 50:15.511
and it still pains me
when I think about it.

50:19.783 --> 50:24.516
And yet, I
also feel very, very strongly

50:24.588 --> 50:27.580
that she felt she was giving
them so much more

50:27.657 --> 50:31.218
than what she was asking them
to sacrifice.

50:31.294 --> 50:34.355
She was giving them
meaningful lives,

50:34.431 --> 50:39.198
which is something that is
very, very rare in this society.

50:41.338 --> 50:43.383
You've got
to have some kind of faith,

50:43.407 --> 50:45.808
you know, if you're going to be
walking away from your kids

50:45.876 --> 50:50.780
like that, you know, and leaving
your families like that.

50:50.847 --> 50:52.144
You've got to believe

50:52.215 --> 50:54.980
in something bigger than you,
you know?

51:11.701 --> 51:14.227
Grape-picking may
be a California problem,

51:14.304 --> 51:16.102
but the United Farm Workers
are determined

51:16.173 --> 51:17.732
to let New Yorkers
know about it.

51:17.808 --> 51:19.674
♪ Bang bang ♪

51:22.345 --> 51:24.143
♪ Bang bang ♪

51:25.949 --> 51:27.314
♪ Bang bang ♪

51:30.587 --> 51:34.080
In the strike, we
were not able to succeed

51:34.157 --> 51:35.886
because the growers
refused to negotiate.

51:35.959 --> 51:39.259
They could just bring in
strike breakers continuously.

51:39.329 --> 51:42.196
So we really had to think about
what other options we had

51:42.265 --> 51:44.927
and it was actually an attorney
from San Francisco

51:45.001 --> 51:46.332
and he said to us,

51:46.403 --> 51:48.929
"Have you ever thought
of trying to boycott?"

51:50.807 --> 51:52.400
We had boycott committees

51:52.476 --> 51:55.468
in Detroit, and Chicago,
and New York City,

51:55.545 --> 51:57.809
and San Francisco,
and then in other cities

51:57.881 --> 52:00.441
throughout the country,
including Canada and Europe.

52:00.517 --> 52:03.248
I was in charge
of the New York boycott,

52:03.320 --> 52:05.812
and I remember speaking
at Madison Square Garden

52:05.889 --> 52:09.553
and they told me I had
60 seconds to deliver my message

52:09.626 --> 52:12.721
and my message was,
"farmworkers are on strike.

52:12.796 --> 52:15.424
"Don't buy grapes.

52:15.499 --> 52:17.900
Don't shop at stores
that have grapes."

52:17.968 --> 52:19.595
That was it.

52:19.669 --> 52:23.230
What first comes
to mind is what Dolores modeled,

52:23.306 --> 52:26.435
which was to go out
and meet new people,

52:26.510 --> 52:31.676
and make those connections
about this struggle for justice.

52:31.748 --> 52:33.944
The first support
that we got was from

52:34.017 --> 52:37.146
the African-American community,
the Puerto Rican community.

52:37.220 --> 52:38.710
We did not have to go
into Harlem

52:38.788 --> 52:40.517
to get them
to take the grapes out.

52:40.590 --> 52:41.853
They did it on their own.

52:41.925 --> 52:43.256
The same thing in the Bronx

52:43.326 --> 52:45.226
with the Puerto Rican
brothers and sisters.

52:45.295 --> 52:47.127
They said,
"You want to get the grapes out?

52:47.197 --> 52:48.722
We'll get them out,"
and they did.

52:48.798 --> 52:51.010
But it was the farmworkers
themselves that went out there

52:51.034 --> 52:52.160
and told their stories,

52:52.235 --> 52:54.260
getting people involved
to volunteer

52:54.337 --> 52:56.135
to get those stores
to take the grapes out.

52:56.206 --> 53:00.234
I am not ashamed
because I am poor.

53:00.310 --> 53:03.336
I am proud
because I am a farmworker.

53:03.413 --> 53:04.690
All of the farmworkers grew.

53:04.714 --> 53:06.478
They learned to be
public speakers.

53:06.550 --> 53:08.484
Whereas they had been treated

53:08.552 --> 53:10.782
as dirt in the outside society,

53:10.854 --> 53:14.313
suddenly they were being given
a podium to tell their story

53:14.391 --> 53:18.624
and regain their own sense
of worth in that process.

53:18.695 --> 53:23.997
I didn't really
know Dolores before New York,

53:24.067 --> 53:25.660
but I think I was scared of her.

53:27.037 --> 53:31.406
I don't think that Dolores
thought I was worth the trouble

53:31.474 --> 53:33.841
until I got Huntington Hartford
to picket the A&P,

53:33.910 --> 53:36.106
which of course got press

53:36.179 --> 53:37.977
because the heir
to the A&P fortune

53:38.048 --> 53:40.949
was boycotting the A&P.

53:41.017 --> 53:42.951
After that, we became partners.

53:43.019 --> 53:47.388
My mother was raised
a Catholic and very traditional,

53:47.457 --> 53:49.516
and prior to going
to New York City,

53:49.593 --> 53:51.618
she really didn't speak
of feminism.

53:51.695 --> 53:53.424
I was in New York

53:53.496 --> 53:55.863
when the feminist movement
was being born,

53:55.932 --> 53:58.902
but my mind was focused
on getting all of those women

53:58.969 --> 54:01.597
at those conventions to support
the farmworkers.

54:01.671 --> 54:06.268
There was a time
when rarely could you discover

54:06.343 --> 54:09.870
women of color
who would identify as feminists

54:09.946 --> 54:15.680
because it was assumed to be
a question simply of gender

54:15.752 --> 54:18.449
and if it was a question
simply of gender,

54:18.521 --> 54:20.649
that gender was white.

54:20.724 --> 54:25.286
When social justice movements
arise in a patriarchal system,

54:25.362 --> 54:28.229
all kinds of false divisions
are made,

54:28.298 --> 54:30.494
and then there was
the additional problem

54:30.567 --> 54:34.629
in a lot of the Hispanic
community of Catholicism,

54:34.704 --> 54:37.696
which is especially oppressive
to women.

54:37.774 --> 54:40.052
I think that the feminist
movement is extremely important.

54:40.076 --> 54:45.708
I don't, of course,
agree with the idea of abortion

54:45.782 --> 54:50.083
because I do know from having 11
children that a fetus is live,

54:50.153 --> 54:51.814
you know?

54:51.888 --> 54:53.788
I think perhaps
in the beginning,

54:53.857 --> 54:56.622
she didn't quite see
that those of us

54:56.693 --> 54:59.253
who were supporting safe
and legal abortion

54:59.329 --> 55:05.701
are supporting the choice to
have a child just as fiercely,

55:05.769 --> 55:07.931
that we were advocating
the right of a woman

55:08.004 --> 55:10.871
to decide the fate
of her own physical self.

55:10.940 --> 55:14.035
That was difficult
for me at the beginning,

55:14.110 --> 55:18.411
but then it made me realize that
a woman really cannot decide

55:18.481 --> 55:20.449
what she wants to do
with her life

55:20.517 --> 55:22.417
unless she has the right
to decide

55:22.485 --> 55:25.284
how many children
she wants to have.

55:25.355 --> 55:28.188
It took us all a while

55:28.258 --> 55:29.783
to get over our divisions,

55:29.859 --> 55:33.659
but we came to realize that
if we had the same adversaries,

55:33.730 --> 55:38.429
we had a lot in common
and needed to organize together.

55:38.501 --> 55:42.028
I was out there fighting
for the Mexican-American movement,

55:42.105 --> 55:43.470
but I was not focused

55:43.540 --> 55:45.474
on the rights
of Mexican-American women.

55:45.542 --> 55:48.011
I think that was the big shift
that I had.

55:48.078 --> 55:50.740
I hope you don't mind
if I give a minute of that time

55:50.814 --> 55:54.182
first to Dolores Huerta
from the Farm Workers.

55:54.250 --> 55:55.911
Down with grapes!

55:55.985 --> 55:57.248
<i>IAbajo!</i>

55:57.320 --> 55:58.788
Down with Gallo wine!

55:58.855 --> 56:00.050
<i>IAbajo!</i>

56:00.123 --> 56:01.682
Down with violence!

56:01.758 --> 56:03.157
<i>IAbajo!</i>

56:03.226 --> 56:04.716
Down with racism!

56:04.794 --> 56:06.159
<i>IAbajo!</i>

56:06.229 --> 56:07.754
Down with sexism!

56:07.831 --> 56:09.060
<i>IAbajo!</i>

56:09.132 --> 56:14.468
<i>Si, se puede, si, se puede,
everybody.</i>

56:14.537 --> 56:18.974
I know that she set me on
fire in terms of racial injustice.

56:19.042 --> 56:21.534
I would not have been able
to see what's hidden

56:21.611 --> 56:25.172
in the fields of our country
without Dolores.

56:25.248 --> 56:26.738
We've picketed all of the firms

56:26.816 --> 56:29.148
that were carrying
scab grapes today,

56:29.219 --> 56:31.779
and we've gotten commitments
from several of the people

56:31.855 --> 56:34.347
out here that they won't handle
scab grapes anymore.

56:34.424 --> 56:38.486
There is no strike
in the vineyards.

56:38.561 --> 56:42.555
The Chavez group, representing
at best a tiny minority,

56:42.632 --> 56:46.296
are seeking to force,
by what amounts to blackmail,

56:46.369 --> 56:51.466
the growers to recognize their
group as the bargaining agent.

56:53.009 --> 56:56.912
I think that the
growers could not envision

56:56.980 --> 57:00.143
their serfs

57:00.216 --> 57:04.084
standing up for themselves
and demanding fair treatment.

57:04.154 --> 57:08.250
And they just couldn't
come to grips with that.

57:08.324 --> 57:11.760
You had the most
exploited workers in this country

57:11.828 --> 57:13.887
rising up and pushing back

57:13.963 --> 57:17.490
and pushing back
in a very effective way,

57:17.567 --> 57:19.262
building coalitions.

57:19.335 --> 57:23.272
Cesar, Dolores, los demés,
they looked like the people

57:23.339 --> 57:24.829
that they were representing.

57:24.908 --> 57:27.070
I think that scared
the hell out of them.

57:27.143 --> 57:28.804
If they should succeed
with this illegal

57:28.878 --> 57:30.471
and this immoral maneuver,

57:30.547 --> 57:32.914
they then move through
the agricultural community

57:32.982 --> 57:34.177
of California.

57:36.085 --> 57:38.076
The administration was buying
even more grapes

57:38.154 --> 57:41.818
to send, ironically,
to the soldiers in Vietnam

57:41.891 --> 57:43.859
by the thousands of pounds.

57:43.927 --> 57:47.090
I mean it was total
government interference.

57:47.163 --> 57:52.465
So this was very clearly
not only a battle

57:52.535 --> 57:54.663
against the growers.

57:54.737 --> 57:56.398
It was a battle
against the government

57:56.473 --> 57:57.716
and their support of the growers

57:57.740 --> 58:00.937
who had helped to put them
in office.

58:01.010 --> 58:03.445
It was political
from the beginning.

58:03.580 --> 58:07.778
I'm against the grape boycott
and I stand firmly against it.

58:11.054 --> 58:13.682
I think Dolores
and the leadership,

58:13.756 --> 58:16.350
they knew what they
were up against.

58:16.426 --> 58:17.552
What the union did

58:17.627 --> 58:19.220
is they made it
a national issue,

58:19.295 --> 58:23.129
and once the moral imperative
became part of the issue,

58:23.199 --> 58:29.161
then whatever power they have,
you've got to crack it.

58:31.975 --> 58:33.552
At the height of the boycott,

58:33.576 --> 58:36.409
there were around
17 million people

58:36.479 --> 58:38.106
who had stopped eating grapes,

58:38.181 --> 58:40.479
and it was
a pretty incredible feeling

58:40.550 --> 58:43.144
to know that people
were receptive to it.

58:43.219 --> 58:44.914
That's what the
grape boycott was.

58:44.988 --> 58:48.481
It was a mass coalition
of people that came together

58:48.558 --> 58:51.220
and helped the poorest people
in the land

58:51.294 --> 58:55.356
bring the most powerful people
in the state of California

58:55.431 --> 58:57.422
to the negotiations table.

58:57.500 --> 58:59.468
Why did you sign with the union?

58:59.536 --> 59:00.779
Why did you negotiate
the contract?

59:00.803 --> 59:02.567
Well, it was the effects
of the boycott.

59:04.874 --> 59:07.809
There it is, the
union stamp, the eagle,

59:07.877 --> 59:09.675
the symbol of the
United Farm Workers,

59:09.746 --> 59:11.942
and now the symbol of victory.

59:12.015 --> 59:16.976
After ten years of struggling,
these now are union vineyards.

59:17.053 --> 59:19.112
My mother had
negotiated an agreement

59:19.188 --> 59:22.214
with the Schenley Corporation
a few years before,

59:22.292 --> 59:25.557
but having reached an agreement
with an entire industry

59:25.628 --> 59:27.892
went beyond people's
initial expectations.

59:27.964 --> 59:31.457
The dream of a union
was now reality.

59:31.534 --> 59:35.767
For the first time, we
began to understand that we were,

59:35.838 --> 59:38.739
in fact, the architects
of our own destiny.

59:38.808 --> 59:40.970
The grape boycott, above all,

59:41.044 --> 59:42.739
shows strategy does
make a difference.

59:42.812 --> 59:46.214
You can have a big heart,
try your best, work 24/7.

59:46.282 --> 59:48.341
If you don't have the right
strategies and tactics,

59:48.418 --> 59:49.647
you're not going to succeed.

59:49.719 --> 59:51.551
Organizing,
it does make a difference.

59:51.621 --> 59:55.854
Under the new contracts,
the wages increase each year.

59:55.925 --> 59:58.257
There are paid vacations
and other fringe benefits.

59:58.328 --> 01:00:02.822
The most important is insurance
and a good medical plan.

01:00:02.899 --> 01:00:05.834
All of that was barely
dreamed of a few years ago

01:00:05.902 --> 01:00:08.564
by most of the pickers.

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:22.250
LORI de LEON: After my
mother went to New York,

01:00:22.318 --> 01:00:26.346
I think it solidified her
beliefs in the power of women.

01:00:26.422 --> 01:00:27.821
I mean, she knew it,

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:30.484
but it just took it
to a whole different level.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:33.586
And when she came back
to the union,

01:00:33.663 --> 01:00:35.722
she stood up more for herself

01:00:35.798 --> 01:00:39.757
with the executive board,
which were all men.

01:00:39.836 --> 01:00:43.295
She wasn't so much asking
for permission to do things,

01:00:43.373 --> 01:00:47.105
she just did what she felt
needed to be done.

01:00:47.176 --> 01:00:52.580
And I think Cesar felt he lost
a little bit of control of her.

01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:56.847
She realized
the knowledge and skillset

01:00:56.919 --> 01:01:00.355
that she brought
to this partnership

01:01:00.423 --> 01:01:01.982
so it became more challenging.

01:01:04.794 --> 01:01:07.525
The relationship
between Cesar and my mother

01:01:07.597 --> 01:01:08.792
was extremely complicated.

01:01:08.865 --> 01:01:10.731
They were probably
the best of friends

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.878
and they had the most passionate
and heated arguments

01:01:12.902 --> 01:01:14.392
that I've ever heard.

01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:16.837
There's got to be
a time where the two of you

01:01:16.906 --> 01:01:18.237
don't agree on something.

01:01:18.307 --> 01:01:19.240
What do you do?

01:01:19.308 --> 01:01:21.072
Well, we would fight
with each other.

01:01:21.144 --> 01:01:24.114
We argue,
but it's always on the issue

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:26.706
and then that's never been
a personality thing.

01:01:26.783 --> 01:01:28.581
LORI de LEON:
They were each other's peers.

01:01:28.651 --> 01:01:32.349
She felt she had every right
to speak up and say her piece

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:34.390
and he didn't like that.

01:01:34.457 --> 01:01:36.802
He would fire her and she'd say,
"I quit," but she'd be there,

01:01:36.826 --> 01:01:38.555
the first one in the office
the next day,

01:01:38.628 --> 01:01:41.222
and it would be
business as usual.

01:01:41.297 --> 01:01:44.232
She and Cesar
were having a heated argument,

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:48.294
and Dolores walks out of the
room and in Spanish she says:

01:01:54.811 --> 01:01:59.044
Growing up, we saw
so many people bowing down to him

01:01:59.115 --> 01:02:02.779
and it was really hard
to see that she was a person

01:02:02.852 --> 01:02:04.320
who was just real with him,

01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:06.355
you know, like nobody else
would be.

01:02:06.422 --> 01:02:09.790
My Tio Cesar was
surrounded by a lot of yes men

01:02:09.859 --> 01:02:11.793
and she was not the yes man.

01:02:11.861 --> 01:02:14.762
She was the chief negotiator.

01:02:14.831 --> 01:02:17.300
She was the cool head
and hard as nails,

01:02:17.366 --> 01:02:18.162
and people knew it,

01:02:18.234 --> 01:02:20.862
and yet there was a group of men

01:02:20.937 --> 01:02:23.167
that preferred to do things
without her.

01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:26.971
I saw a lot of resistance
to her leadership,

01:02:27.043 --> 01:02:29.034
putting obstacles or blocks,

01:02:29.112 --> 01:02:32.980
and it clearly only was because
she was a woman.

01:02:33.049 --> 01:02:35.984
I even said to Cesar
at one point in time, I said,

01:02:36.052 --> 01:02:39.613
"Look, we have a lot of machismo
here in the farmworkers movement

01:02:39.689 --> 01:02:42.659
and I am not going
to take it anymore."

01:02:42.725 --> 01:02:46.059
One year when she
came out in a national magazine,

01:02:46.129 --> 01:02:50.225
she criticized her own union
for being sexist.

01:02:50.299 --> 01:02:52.099
And I remember,
she called me up and she said,

01:02:52.135 --> 01:02:53.625
"Oh, shit's going
to hit the fan,"

01:02:53.703 --> 01:02:56.138
because, you know, as soon
as it gets out and Cesar...

01:02:56.205 --> 01:02:57.645
She said everybody was
pissed at her.

01:02:57.707 --> 01:03:01.701
I thought that was incredibly
brave of her to do that.

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:06.011
Through her example, she
was able to get other women

01:03:06.082 --> 01:03:08.949
to assume leadership roles
within the union.

01:03:09.018 --> 01:03:11.851
Before Dolores, it was all men

01:03:11.921 --> 01:03:15.516
and that was the expectation
that it was men's work.

01:03:15.591 --> 01:03:17.958
The only reason
that we've been able

01:03:18.027 --> 01:03:19.620
to eliminate our enemies
one by one...

01:03:19.695 --> 01:03:23.598
Nixon, Reagan, the growers,
the labor contractors-

01:03:23.666 --> 01:03:27.432
the reason that we're going
to win is because of the marches

01:03:27.503 --> 01:03:30.097
and the strikes, the boycotts,
and the sacrifices of time

01:03:30.173 --> 01:03:33.234
and our families,
you know, going to jail.

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:35.505
This is the reason
that we've been able to survive.

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:45.451
We had contracts,

01:03:45.521 --> 01:03:46.818
not only in California.

01:03:46.889 --> 01:03:49.654
We had contracts in Arizona, New
Mexico, and even parts of Texas.

01:03:49.725 --> 01:03:54.458
LORI de LEON: Workers saw the benefits
of the contracts-the wage increase,

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:57.227
the safety regulations where
they couldn't spray pesticides

01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:59.462
while the workers
were in the fields,

01:03:59.535 --> 01:04:01.560
but the contracts
were only three-year contracts.

01:04:01.637 --> 01:04:05.073
So in 1973, the growers signed
a sweetheart contract

01:04:05.141 --> 01:04:07.041
with the Teamsters Union.

01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:10.773
Well, are the Teamsters
Union easier for the farm growers

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:12.007
to deal with than you people?

01:04:12.048 --> 01:04:13.675
Oh, much so, yes.

01:04:13.749 --> 01:04:15.994
Yes, because they don't make
any demands on the employers.

01:04:16.018 --> 01:04:17.729
See, the Teamsters Union
came into agriculture

01:04:17.753 --> 01:04:20.916
to protect the growers
from the United Farm Workers.

01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:23.482
So under the so-called
Teamster contracts,

01:04:23.559 --> 01:04:25.618
the farmworkers don't really get
any protections.

01:04:29.065 --> 01:04:31.193
LORI de LEON: So at that time,
workers went on strike.

01:04:31.267 --> 01:04:33.167
At issue is the future

01:04:33.236 --> 01:04:34.897
of the United Farm
Workers Union.

01:04:34.971 --> 01:04:36.097
The opposition force

01:04:36.172 --> 01:04:39.039
is the biggest and richest union
in the world.

01:04:39.108 --> 01:04:41.509
The Teamsters have poured
both money and muscle

01:04:41.577 --> 01:04:45.104
into the fight to represent
all California grape workers.

01:04:45.181 --> 01:04:47.843
You're a lousy bunch
of commie bums!

01:04:47.917 --> 01:04:49.078
He's not afraid.

01:04:49.151 --> 01:04:51.142
You stink! You smell!

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:53.746
LORI de LEON: They had all
these injunctions against us.

01:04:53.823 --> 01:04:57.657
So, there was a decision made
to go ahead and violate them.

01:04:57.727 --> 01:05:02.096
Sheriff's deputies have
arrested the reported 1,700 farmworkers

01:05:02.164 --> 01:05:04.633
on picket lines
in four counties.

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:07.465
The arrests have given
new impetus to the farmworkers

01:05:07.536 --> 01:05:10.005
in this battle
the Teamsters have called

01:05:10.072 --> 01:05:12.370
a fight to the finish.

01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:15.103
LORI de LEON: After that
came all the violence.

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:22.104
My great-grandfather was
in the Civil War on the Union side.

01:06:22.178 --> 01:06:25.978
My father was in the military.

01:06:26.048 --> 01:06:27.743
My brother was in the military.

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:29.546
And I remember when I first read

01:06:29.618 --> 01:06:32.053
the Constitution of the
United States in grammar school,

01:06:32.121 --> 01:06:36.615
I always felt so proud
of being an American.

01:06:36.692 --> 01:06:39.059
I thought, "God, we have
all these rights," you know.

01:06:39.128 --> 01:06:40.892
In a democracy,
you make your demands

01:06:40.963 --> 01:06:42.727
and then somebody
will listen to you.

01:06:42.798 --> 01:06:43.959
Justice will prevail.

01:06:44.033 --> 01:06:46.730
But I found out
that when you do this

01:06:46.802 --> 01:06:51.137
in an economic situation,
it doesn't quite work like that.

01:06:51.207 --> 01:06:53.539
Once we started making
those kind of demands,

01:06:53.609 --> 01:06:57.910
we had the same response
that the black movement has had.

01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:01.575
Our people were killed.

01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:07.020
The system doesn't really want
brown people or black people

01:07:07.089 --> 01:07:11.083
to have an organization
and to have any power.

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:14.186
I found out that no matter
what I did,

01:07:14.263 --> 01:07:18.666
I could never be an American.

01:07:18.734 --> 01:07:19.758
Never.

01:07:32.114 --> 01:07:35.379
Big business and agribusiness,

01:07:35.451 --> 01:07:37.010
and racist police departments,

01:07:37.086 --> 01:07:39.077
or corrupt police departments,

01:07:39.155 --> 01:07:42.420
whoever it is
that's taking part in that,

01:07:42.491 --> 01:07:44.491
nobody's ever been convicted
for any of the murders

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.927
of any of the martyrs
of the United Farm Workers.

01:07:46.996 --> 01:07:50.455
You know, think about that.

01:07:50.533 --> 01:07:55.903
That animosity is visceral, and
it's hate, and it's racial hate.

01:07:55.971 --> 01:08:01.375
You know, it's basically
the economics of racism.

01:08:01.444 --> 01:08:03.355
They were willing to sign
contracts with the Teamsters,

01:08:03.379 --> 01:08:06.178
pay a lot of money
as long as the workers

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:07.545
can be kept oppressed.

01:08:07.616 --> 01:08:11.348
They will not accept workers
as their equals.

01:08:13.289 --> 01:08:14.499
You've been fighting so long.

01:08:14.523 --> 01:08:16.184
Do you ever get so tired
of fighting

01:08:16.258 --> 01:08:18.920
you think you can't do it
another day?

01:08:18.993 --> 01:08:22.897
Well, I haven't felt that way.

01:08:22.965 --> 01:08:24.228
You have to have commitment.

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:25.768
It's got to be a total
commitment.

01:08:25.835 --> 01:08:28.202
It's not something that you can
just come in and leave.

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:29.897
You've got to stay there
and keep working

01:08:29.971 --> 01:08:31.962
in order to make a difference.

01:08:32.041 --> 01:08:38.104
One has to understand
that Dolores does not waste time

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:41.206
in negativity.

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:43.341
Yes, what could we have done
better, et cetera,

01:08:43.419 --> 01:08:44.944
but it's forward.

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:49.479
Do what has to be done and
move forward and move forward.

01:08:51.026 --> 01:08:52.737
California
legislature passed a farm bill

01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:55.321
it hopes will end violence
in the fields there.

01:08:55.397 --> 01:08:57.475
Under the new
Agricultural Labor Relations law,

01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:58.977
we'll be certified
as a bargaining representative

01:08:59.001 --> 01:09:01.197
and the employers have a duty
to bargain with us.

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:02.714
Could you support Jimmy Carter?

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:06.368
At this point, no,
unless he can really prove

01:09:06.442 --> 01:09:09.412
that he is willing to keep the
social contract with the people.

01:09:09.478 --> 01:09:12.607
The reason that we've
lost ground is political.

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:15.149
It's because of the Agricultural
Labor Relations board.

01:09:15.216 --> 01:09:16.981
Because of the appointments
that were made,

01:09:17.051 --> 01:09:19.020
the growers refused to bargain.

01:09:19.087 --> 01:09:20.332
If we file charges,
they're dismissed.

01:09:20.356 --> 01:09:22.381
So there's no protections
out there for workers.

01:09:22.457 --> 01:09:25.291
Farmworkers still toil at
the bottom of the economic ladder,

01:09:25.361 --> 01:09:27.557
often exploited in ways
that are still shocking.

01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:29.550
Immigrants were
discouraged from voting.

01:09:29.598 --> 01:09:31.930
And so we have got to say
to them,

01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:33.310
"Look, it's okay
for you to vote."

01:09:33.335 --> 01:09:35.303
It's important and we want them
to participate

01:09:35.371 --> 01:09:36.462
in the political process.

01:09:36.538 --> 01:09:38.337
Work on the bill resumes today

01:09:38.407 --> 01:09:39.984
with debate centered on
the controversial amendment

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:41.841
granting amnesty
to illegal aliens.

01:09:41.911 --> 01:09:44.312
Since we do have a
special legalization program

01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:45.745
for the farmworkers,

01:09:45.814 --> 01:09:47.459
they will not be afraid then
to make complaints

01:09:47.483 --> 01:09:49.027
if they know
that they won't get deported.

01:09:49.051 --> 01:09:51.062
It's going to make a tremendous
amount of difference.

01:09:51.086 --> 01:09:55.648
Some four million illegal
aliens are expected to seek amnesty.

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:59.393
We are ready to give those
people permanent residency.

01:10:00.963 --> 01:10:03.163
But the growers don't
want them to be legalized

01:10:03.232 --> 01:10:04.757
because once they're legalized,

01:10:04.833 --> 01:10:06.995
they can protest
against pesticide poisoning.

01:10:07.069 --> 01:10:10.266
They can protest the low wages
that they're being given.

01:10:11.807 --> 01:10:13.536
George Bush spent the day
in California

01:10:13.609 --> 01:10:16.078
talking about the economy
and the need for compassion.

01:10:16.145 --> 01:10:17.943
Last night in San Francisco,

01:10:18.013 --> 01:10:21.244
police moved in to break up
a protest outside a fund raiser

01:10:21.317 --> 01:10:22.648
for the vice president.

01:10:22.718 --> 01:10:24.948
I must say,
you have a peculiar breed

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:26.579
of demonstrators out there.

01:10:26.655 --> 01:10:29.750
They're giving me grief there
and his hair was flying around

01:10:29.825 --> 01:10:31.418
and, "No drilling! No drilling!"

01:10:31.493 --> 01:10:34.326
I finally said,
"I don't want to do anything

01:10:34.396 --> 01:10:35.807
that's going to hurt
the environment."

01:10:35.831 --> 01:10:38.232
"What about contras?
What about contras?"

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:40.598
I'm glad to be inside.

01:10:44.673 --> 01:10:49.372
My friends...
Yes, I do mean friends...

01:10:49.445 --> 01:10:54.007
We know how to secure
a more just and prosperous life

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:58.418
for man on earth,
with free markets, free speech,

01:10:58.487 --> 01:11:02.253
free elections,
and the exercise of free will

01:11:02.324 --> 01:11:05.089
unhampered by the state.

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:10.496
America is never wholly herself
unless she is engaged

01:11:10.566 --> 01:11:14.662
in high moral principle,

01:11:14.737 --> 01:11:18.071
for democracy belongs to us all.

01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:22.543
No one is quite sure
how things got out of hand

01:11:22.611 --> 01:11:25.410
at the demonstration outside
the hotel where George Bush

01:11:25.481 --> 01:11:27.245
was speaking last night.

01:11:27.316 --> 01:11:31.150
This police footage
clearly shows.

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:33.655
UFW leader Dolores Huerta

01:11:33.722 --> 01:11:38.023
trying to move as ordered
by police.

01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:18.726
A crowd control officer
bashed her body with a police baton

01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:21.771
and when we thought
that we lost her,

01:12:21.837 --> 01:12:25.535
it was really scary
and really unexpected.

01:12:25.607 --> 01:12:30.807
I was not ready to lose my mom
before turning 20 years old.

01:12:30.879 --> 01:12:33.871
Tonight, Dolores
Huerta is recovering

01:12:33.949 --> 01:12:36.646
from three broken ribs
and emergency surgery

01:12:36.719 --> 01:12:38.312
that removed her spleen.

01:12:38.387 --> 01:12:39.980
Huerta's son Emilio

01:12:40.055 --> 01:12:42.251
is grateful to the hospital
she is alive.

01:12:42.324 --> 01:12:44.349
Without their support,

01:12:44.426 --> 01:12:46.827
she would not be alive today.

01:12:52.067 --> 01:12:54.832
It was very hard
to see this powerful, strong,

01:12:54.903 --> 01:12:59.864
beautiful, like intimidating
woman just be reduced,

01:12:59.942 --> 01:13:03.674
you know, to just being
bedridden, you know.

01:13:06.415 --> 01:13:10.977
If you could use one
adjective to describe Dolores,

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:12.680
it is dynamic.

01:13:12.755 --> 01:13:18.626
So the hardest thing that could
happen to her is to be immobile.

01:13:18.694 --> 01:13:24.656
She was lying in bed and looking
terrible, physically,

01:13:24.733 --> 01:13:27.464
and I just felt terrible
and said,

01:13:27.536 --> 01:13:29.527
"Dolores, what can I do
for you?"

01:13:29.605 --> 01:13:34.771
And she just said,
"Boycott Safeway."

01:13:36.178 --> 01:13:39.273
The only good thing
that I can think that came

01:13:39.348 --> 01:13:44.377
out of that experience was that
it was forced family time.

01:13:44.453 --> 01:13:47.081
And so we all got to have
as much of my mom

01:13:47.156 --> 01:13:48.317
as we wanted around.

01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:51.485
My kids were with me 24 hours.

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:53.824
They took turns, 24 hours.

01:13:53.896 --> 01:13:55.921
I was sick
for many, many months.

01:13:55.998 --> 01:13:58.729
They never left me alone,
not even one day.

01:13:58.801 --> 01:14:01.827
And when you think about all the
times that I left them alone

01:14:01.904 --> 01:14:04.305
with different people
taking care of them,

01:14:04.373 --> 01:14:05.932
sometimes complete strangers,

01:14:06.008 --> 01:14:10.275
and yet they were so kind
to take care of me.

01:14:10.345 --> 01:14:12.624
It was interesting,
because all her children

01:14:12.648 --> 01:14:14.673
got together to support her,

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:16.548
and that's when she realized

01:14:16.618 --> 01:14:18.643
that family
was really important to her.

01:14:20.422 --> 01:14:25.258
There was a reconciliation
on the part of the children too

01:14:25.327 --> 01:14:26.488
with their mother.

01:14:26.562 --> 01:14:29.293
That was sort of an awakening.

01:14:29.364 --> 01:14:32.629
We felt that we needed to be
less critical of my mother

01:14:32.701 --> 01:14:34.294
and her lifestyle,

01:14:34.369 --> 01:14:37.395
and we needed to support
my mother more

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:41.103
in whatever role
that she decided to take on.

01:15:11.807 --> 01:15:14.003
LORI de LEON: After that
incident in San Francisco,

01:15:14.076 --> 01:15:18.172
you know, it took her a long
time to recover and come back.

01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:24.448
And her absence made Cesar
more aware of her importance.

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:29.048
Her coming back
and being there 100%

01:15:29.124 --> 01:15:31.821
reestablished his commitment
to her.

01:15:31.894 --> 01:15:34.886
I remember when they
were working together,

01:15:34.963 --> 01:15:38.627
she came home and she said, "You
know what Cesar told me today?"

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:42.159
"He thanked me for keeping him
honest all these years.

01:15:42.237 --> 01:15:43.671
Those were his words."

01:15:43.739 --> 01:15:45.867
She goes,
"I was taken aback by that."

01:15:45.941 --> 01:15:50.378
That was so unusual of
Cesar because within a few moments

01:15:50.445 --> 01:15:51.776
that we were together,

01:15:51.847 --> 01:15:53.941
we would usually be picking
a fight with each other.

01:15:54.016 --> 01:16:00.251
His whole behavior was so...
not like Cesar.

01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:11.530
As long as there's one
ounce of strength in our bodies,

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:13.500
that ounce of strength
will be used

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:14.934
to fight for this good cause.

01:16:15.003 --> 01:16:18.837
And in the end, we will win.

01:16:24.179 --> 01:16:27.240
Cesar Chavez was found
dead yesterday in Arizona,

01:16:27.316 --> 01:16:29.648
apparently of natural causes.

01:16:29.718 --> 01:16:32.415
An estimated 25,000 people
turned out Thursday

01:16:32.487 --> 01:16:34.455
in Delano, California,
for the funeral

01:16:34.523 --> 01:16:36.082
of labor leader Cesar Chavez,

01:16:36.158 --> 01:16:40.618
many of them farmworkers
Chavez helped to organize.

01:16:42.965 --> 01:16:46.993
I know she
misses my Tio Cesar a lot.

01:16:47.069 --> 01:16:48.833
He was a glue.

01:16:48.904 --> 01:16:52.738
He was like a certain
binding agent, you know?

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:57.841
Like you miss the sun
on a cloudy day.

01:16:57.913 --> 01:16:59.278
You know what I'm saying?

01:17:02.851 --> 01:17:06.719
Who will fill his shoes or
what process will you go through?

01:17:06.788 --> 01:17:09.120
The executive board of the union
will be meeting

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:11.489
and then they will decide
who the next president

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:12.959
of the union will be.

01:17:13.028 --> 01:17:15.190
That is the process that we have
in our constitution.

01:17:15.263 --> 01:17:18.130
Do you feel you could
fill his shoes if you had to?

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:22.034
Well, I think I worked
very many years with Cesar,

01:17:22.104 --> 01:17:24.937
but I think it's up
to the executive board

01:17:25.007 --> 01:17:27.738
to decide who they want,
you know.

01:17:29.711 --> 01:17:31.356
It certainly was an expectation

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:34.281
on a number of people's part

01:17:34.349 --> 01:17:36.977
that when Cesar died,
Dolores would take it over

01:17:37.052 --> 01:17:40.352
since she had been in there
since the beginning.

01:17:40.422 --> 01:17:41.651
You could imagine,

01:17:41.723 --> 01:17:43.919
a farmworker's union
run by a woman?

01:17:43.992 --> 01:17:46.620
That would have been history.

01:17:46.695 --> 01:17:48.959
But she was not chosen.

01:17:49.031 --> 01:17:53.434
She called me to
tell me after Cesar passed

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:57.439
that she was not going
to succeed Cesar as president

01:17:57.506 --> 01:18:01.204
and I, like, got so upset.

01:18:01.276 --> 01:18:04.871
And then she said to me
real calm, like super-calm,

01:18:04.946 --> 01:18:07.472
but I could tell
there was hurt in her voice,

01:18:07.549 --> 01:18:10.712
she said, "Barbara, it would be
one fight after another"

01:18:10.786 --> 01:18:12.254
if I fought for this."

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.721
LORI de LEON:
The workers wanted her.

01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:16.280
The volunteers wanted her.

01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:18.622
The membership wanted her,

01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:19.923
but it was not about her,

01:18:19.995 --> 01:18:23.625
it was about
the union's survival.

01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:25.043
And so, she advocated
for someone else,

01:18:25.067 --> 01:18:27.195
Arturo Rodriguez
to become the president,

01:18:27.269 --> 01:18:31.866
who remains the president
of the union to this day.

01:18:34.409 --> 01:18:37.003
After that,
my mother started advocating

01:18:37.079 --> 01:18:41.949
to go back to the original way
of community organizing,

01:18:42.017 --> 01:18:47.046
but she was receiving a lot of
opposition from the leadership.

01:18:49.758 --> 01:18:51.783
I think there were indications
that her input

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:55.319
was not as welcome
as one would have thought.

01:18:55.397 --> 01:19:00.801
LORI de LEON:
It was very hard to see that

01:19:00.869 --> 01:19:02.860
after all that my mother
had given,

01:19:02.938 --> 01:19:04.531
all the years of her life,

01:19:04.606 --> 01:19:06.973
putting the union
above all else,

01:19:07.042 --> 01:19:10.012
you know,
including all her 11 children.

01:19:12.214 --> 01:19:16.208
A lot of things
changed and I just felt that

01:19:16.284 --> 01:19:20.118
maybe it was really time
for me to leave and I left.

01:19:28.764 --> 01:19:31.028
I remember the convention

01:19:31.099 --> 01:19:33.761
where she actually gave
her resignation.

01:19:33.835 --> 01:19:38.272
It was a very emotional
experience

01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:41.002
and I think very difficult
for her.

01:19:42.244 --> 01:19:44.372
La compafiera, Dolores Huerta.

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:22.307
LORI de LEON: I remember my sisters and
I and my brother being on the stage

01:20:22.384 --> 01:20:26.116
and surrounding my mother
for support.

01:21:02.624 --> 01:21:06.060
It was almost
like when Cesar died, you know?

01:21:06.127 --> 01:21:10.655
It was like a big part
of the farmworker thing dying.

01:21:10.732 --> 01:21:15.135
Everybody there was like...
I don't know, in shock,

01:21:15.203 --> 01:21:17.137
disbelief, you know.

01:21:17.205 --> 01:21:18.366
<i>G, Por qué, Dolores?</i>

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.807
<i>No te vayas.</i>

01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:22.435
<i>No puedes.</i>

01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:23.978
<i>Z, Qué vamos a hacer'?</i>

01:21:24.045 --> 01:21:27.675
I tell you, there wasn't
a dry eye in the house.

01:21:55.710 --> 01:21:58.611
Dolores Huerta!

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:00.671
Dolores Huerta!

01:22:00.749 --> 01:22:02.239
Dolores Huerta!

01:22:24.639 --> 01:22:27.074
I can't imagine
what she went through

01:22:27.142 --> 01:22:31.511
resigning from the union.

01:22:31.579 --> 01:22:36.676
There had to have been some
grieving, but knowing Dolores,

01:22:36.751 --> 01:22:40.688
there also had to have been some
si, se puede moments also,

01:22:40.755 --> 01:22:45.352
"I'm going to do something
significant despite this."

01:22:47.228 --> 01:22:50.664
Then she got
a Puffin/Nation award,

01:22:50.732 --> 01:22:53.463
which was $100,000 to do

01:22:53.535 --> 01:22:55.196
whatever she wanted
to do with it.

01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:58.205
There were no strings attached
at all.

01:22:58.273 --> 01:23:00.037
She could have kept that money

01:23:00.108 --> 01:23:02.440
to have a comfortable life
for herself,

01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:04.945
but Dolores has never been
interested

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.344
in a comfortable life
for herself.

01:23:07.415 --> 01:23:11.977
After I'm feeling bad
about having to leave the union,

01:23:12.053 --> 01:23:13.885
I thought to myself,

01:23:13.955 --> 01:23:15.423
I'm going to use that money

01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:17.458
to start doing
community organizing.

01:23:17.525 --> 01:23:22.292
That is when Dolores
announces that she is founding

01:23:22.364 --> 01:23:24.389
the Dolores Huerta Foundation.

01:23:27.769 --> 01:23:30.670
We're going to start out
with Organizing 101.

01:23:30.739 --> 01:23:34.471
She is really
going to the grass roots,

01:23:34.542 --> 01:23:36.287
into peoples' homes again,
the house meetings,

01:23:36.311 --> 01:23:39.144
seeing what people's issues are,

01:23:39.214 --> 01:23:41.012
helping to give them the support

01:23:41.082 --> 01:23:42.481
so that they become vocal

01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:45.884
and training the people
to become community organizers.

01:23:45.954 --> 01:23:50.357
In the long term, I think
it afforded her a sense of freedom,

01:23:50.425 --> 01:23:51.984
freedom to touch every issue:

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:53.687
Feminism,

01:23:53.762 --> 01:23:55.127
the environment,

01:23:55.196 --> 01:23:58.131
the politics of our people,
Latinos.

01:23:58.199 --> 01:24:01.499
She made it all connect.

01:24:01.569 --> 01:24:04.869
We're not going
to stop until we get

01:24:04.939 --> 01:24:06.304
more legalization.

01:24:06.374 --> 01:24:08.103
[Si, se puede!

01:24:08.176 --> 01:24:10.008
<i>535. 35, se puede!</i>

01:24:10.078 --> 01:24:11.978
<i>35, se puede!</i>

01:24:12.047 --> 01:24:14.106
<i>- Viva la mujer!
- Viva!</i>

01:24:14.182 --> 01:24:16.276
<i>Viva la raza!</i>

01:24:16.351 --> 01:24:17.716
We can make the change,

01:24:17.786 --> 01:24:19.618
but it's got to start with us.

01:24:22.190 --> 01:24:25.182
And now in Tucson, Arizona,
800 students heard

01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:27.695
labor activist Dolores Huerta
say this:

01:24:31.933 --> 01:24:34.334
Dolores would
come to town regularly

01:24:34.402 --> 01:24:36.427
to speak to our youth,

01:24:36.504 --> 01:24:39.166
but the only thing that came
from that was that phrase,

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:41.106
"Republicans hate Latinos."

01:24:41.176 --> 01:24:43.372
The blowback was pretty intense.

01:24:43.445 --> 01:24:48.383
Dolores Huerta telling our kids
that Republicans hate Latinos.

01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:50.077
I think that's hate speech.

01:24:50.151 --> 01:24:52.313
The Texas State.

01:24:52.387 --> 01:24:57.621
Board of Education
rejected that you

01:24:57.692 --> 01:25:00.593
be part of the social studies
curriculum.

01:25:00.662 --> 01:25:03.654
The reason people are
opposed to Dolores Huerta,

01:25:03.731 --> 01:25:05.927
she has been quoted as saying
some other things

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.401
that are rather negative.

01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:10.414
Horne says Huerta should not
be allowed to address

01:25:10.438 --> 01:25:12.736
any public school assemblies
in Arizona.

01:25:12.807 --> 01:25:14.935
He was testifying
on behalf of a bill

01:25:15.009 --> 01:25:18.445
which would outlaw ethnic
studies in public schools.

01:25:18.513 --> 01:25:20.311
Ethnic studies
were brought to my attention

01:25:20.381 --> 01:25:23.214
when a lady named Dolores Huerta
gave a speech

01:25:23.284 --> 01:25:26.151
at the Tucson High School.

01:25:26.221 --> 01:25:29.657
She was a former girlfriend
of Cesar Chavez.

01:25:29.724 --> 01:25:32.819
If we go full circle to
how politicians of the state

01:25:32.894 --> 01:25:37.388
and then on Fox News would refer
to her as Cesar's sidekick or,

01:25:37.465 --> 01:25:40.366
in the case of Home,
actually saying his girlfriend,

01:25:40.435 --> 01:25:42.836
it was a perfect example
why we need ethnic studies

01:25:42.904 --> 01:25:46.534
because we have people in power
at the policy level

01:25:46.608 --> 01:25:49.805
that have no idea of
the true heroes of this country.

01:25:49.878 --> 01:25:52.370
I gotta tell you, I never
heard of this woman before.

01:25:52.447 --> 01:25:55.075
She's big in Arizona.
I don't know her.

01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:58.017
I mean we're
knee-deep in sexism.

01:25:58.086 --> 01:25:59.781
We're like downtown sexism city

01:25:59.854 --> 01:26:04.121
when it comes to how powerful
she is, you know,

01:26:04.192 --> 01:26:05.455
and why she isn't studied,

01:26:05.527 --> 01:26:07.655
and why people don't know her.

01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:14.726
It is absolutely important
to recognize the extent to which

01:26:14.802 --> 01:26:18.761
Dolores was viewed
as a subsidiary figure

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.330
and Cesar Chavez,

01:26:20.408 --> 01:26:24.242
I have all the respect and
reverence in the world for him,

01:26:24.312 --> 01:26:27.748
but the assumption was
he was the leader

01:26:27.815 --> 01:26:31.809
and Dolores was the housekeeper
of the movement.

01:26:31.886 --> 01:26:34.651
If you look at
the books that were written,

01:26:34.722 --> 01:26:37.316
you never see Dolores Huerta
referred to as cofounder.

01:26:37.392 --> 01:26:40.521
She was there
at the very beginning.

01:26:40.595 --> 01:26:42.586
She was there as a woman
representing

01:26:42.664 --> 01:26:46.498
half of the working labor force
in the fields.

01:26:46.568 --> 01:26:49.037
I think it is
absolutely essential

01:26:49.103 --> 01:26:50.537
that people acknowledge

01:26:50.605 --> 01:26:53.199
that it's male and female
working together.

01:26:53.274 --> 01:26:57.643
We try to impress
upon her that it is important.

01:26:57.712 --> 01:27:00.909
Latina girls do need to see
statues of you

01:27:00.982 --> 01:27:03.952
and they do need to have you
in their history books.

01:27:04.018 --> 01:27:05.663
Like we've really got to set
the record straight.

01:27:05.687 --> 01:27:07.712
I mean women cannot be written
out of history.

01:27:07.789 --> 01:27:10.850
It's about all the generations

01:27:10.925 --> 01:27:14.293
of young Chicanas,
young women of color,

01:27:14.362 --> 01:27:17.059
who are currently involved
in their own struggles

01:27:17.131 --> 01:27:20.795
and need to be taught
by example.

01:27:20.868 --> 01:27:23.530
We're never going to change

01:27:23.605 --> 01:27:25.664
if folks keep their place
and stay quiet,

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:27.765
especially women,
especially Latinas.

01:27:27.842 --> 01:27:30.675
So, my mother,
her story will be told

01:27:30.745 --> 01:27:34.545
and it's our job
to make that happen.

01:27:34.616 --> 01:27:36.448
Her opinion is changing now

01:27:36.517 --> 01:27:40.147
but it's a constant struggle
for her.

01:27:40.221 --> 01:27:42.099
We as women, we're so
used to being accommodators.

01:27:42.123 --> 01:27:44.114
We want to try to please people.

01:27:44.192 --> 01:27:48.254
We have to learn to think about
ourselves and what do they say?

01:27:48.329 --> 01:27:50.140
As a woman, you're just thinking
about yourself,

01:27:50.164 --> 01:27:51.859
then you are what?
Selfish, right?

01:27:51.933 --> 01:27:55.892
If a woman is assertive,
they use the B word, right?

01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:58.940
I just always felt
it was wrong for me

01:27:59.007 --> 01:28:01.476
to try to take credit
for the work that I did.

01:28:01.542 --> 01:28:03.340
I don't think that way anymore.

01:28:03.411 --> 01:28:05.971
We've got to be able
to say our ideas

01:28:06.047 --> 01:28:08.539
and then I'm going to quote
Gloria Steinem on this,

01:28:08.616 --> 01:28:11.142
"Put lights around it," right?

01:28:11.219 --> 01:28:12.914
"Beat the drum.

01:28:12.987 --> 01:28:14.386
"You know, put it in writing.

01:28:14.455 --> 01:28:15.786
"Put your name on it
to make sure

01:28:15.857 --> 01:28:18.883
that you get the credit
for the idea that you had."

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:20.086
<i>85, se puede.</i>

01:28:20.161 --> 01:28:22.528
<i>35, se puede!</i>

01:28:22.597 --> 01:28:28.036
For Cesar, "Si, se puede,"
wasn't just a slogan.

01:28:28.102 --> 01:28:29.695
When people in Arizona said,

01:28:29.771 --> 01:28:31.739
they told me,
"No, Dolores, no se puede.

01:28:31.806 --> 01:28:34.901
You can't do this in Arizona,
only in California,"

01:28:34.976 --> 01:28:36.774
<i>my response</i> to <i>them was,
"Si, se puede."</i>

01:28:36.844 --> 01:28:38.835
<i>Si, se puede. 35, se puede.</i>

01:28:38.913 --> 01:28:41.883
Hers was the rallying cry
that would later come to define

01:28:41.949 --> 01:28:45.681
the presidential campaign
of candidate Barack Obama.

01:28:45.753 --> 01:28:46.811
Yes, we can!

01:28:46.888 --> 01:28:50.882
Have you heard President Obama
say, "Yes, we can"?

01:28:50.958 --> 01:28:54.087
It came from Cesar Chavez,
"[Si, se puede!"

01:28:54.162 --> 01:28:58.827
Dolores Huerta came
up with the slogan "Si, <i>se</i> puede"

01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:03.269
and we all attribute that
to Cesar Chavez,

01:29:03.338 --> 01:29:05.272
even Barack Obama.

01:29:05.406 --> 01:29:09.138
Of course, when he gave her the
Presidential Medal of Freedom,

01:29:09.210 --> 01:29:11.941
he had to correct himself.

01:29:12.013 --> 01:29:14.641
On a personal note,
Dolores was very gracious

01:29:14.716 --> 01:29:18.880
when I told her I had stolen
her slogan, "Si, se puede."

01:29:18.953 --> 01:29:20.079
Yes, we can."

01:29:21.556 --> 01:29:25.390
Knowing her, I'm pleased
that she let me off easy

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:28.987
because Dolores does not play.

01:29:36.871 --> 01:29:41.035
All that a person
has is his or her story:

01:29:41.109 --> 01:29:42.702
Who they are,
what they've gone through,

01:29:42.777 --> 01:29:44.154
what their families
have gone through.

01:29:44.178 --> 01:29:45.668
This is their story.

01:29:45.747 --> 01:29:48.273
And when you're trying
to deny them their story,

01:29:48.349 --> 01:29:50.317
you're taking away their power.

01:29:50.385 --> 01:29:52.820
When you hear Dolores Huerta

01:29:52.887 --> 01:29:54.981
talking about the erasure
of indigenous,

01:29:55.056 --> 01:29:58.890
black, and other memories
in our histories,

01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:03.056
it's really about
that struggle for memory

01:30:03.131 --> 01:30:04.690
and the memory that emancipates

01:30:04.766 --> 01:30:06.928
or the memory that enslaves.

01:30:07.001 --> 01:30:11.268
That's what we learned
from our antepasados

01:30:11.339 --> 01:30:14.331
and our ancestors
and from Dolores:

01:30:14.409 --> 01:30:17.538
You don't have
to cower to power.

01:30:17.612 --> 01:30:20.809
You have your own dignity.

01:30:20.882 --> 01:30:22.577
It's beautiful to be Mexican.

01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:27.747
It's beautiful to be Chicano.

01:30:27.822 --> 01:30:34.387
A yes would
insert Dolores Huerta.

01:30:34.462 --> 01:30:36.055
The vote is six to nine.

01:30:36.130 --> 01:30:37.962
The amendment fails.

01:30:38.032 --> 01:30:41.559
Arizona governor Jan
Brewer has signed the law

01:30:41.636 --> 01:30:44.697
banning ethnic studies
in Arizona public schools.

01:30:44.772 --> 01:30:47.104
No matter what Tom Horne does

01:30:47.175 --> 01:30:48.700
or what Jan Brewer does,

01:30:48.776 --> 01:30:50.505
nothing that they can do
can stop us

01:30:50.578 --> 01:30:53.070
from telling our stories.

01:30:53.147 --> 01:30:57.607
So her legacy to me
is one of sustainability.

01:30:57.685 --> 01:31:01.053
You can do this work
and not burn out, right?

01:31:01.122 --> 01:31:04.387
None of us have an excuse
to tap out.

01:31:04.459 --> 01:31:06.154
You were a young girl.

01:31:06.227 --> 01:31:07.752
You must have had a dream.

01:31:07.829 --> 01:31:10.457
Not the dream of being someone
who liberated farmworkers.

01:31:10.531 --> 01:31:13.262
There must have been something
beyond that.

01:31:13.334 --> 01:31:14.631
Could I have chosen,

01:31:14.702 --> 01:31:16.761
I would probably
have been a dancer.

01:31:16.838 --> 01:31:20.433
I love dancing very much
and music very much,

01:31:20.508 --> 01:31:22.340
but I found out
that I like people better

01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:24.139
than I do dancing or music.

01:31:29.517 --> 01:31:33.385
Despite the fact that
Dolores didn't follow her passion

01:31:33.454 --> 01:31:35.047
to become a dancer,

01:31:35.122 --> 01:31:40.219
she is a dancer
on the stage of justice.
