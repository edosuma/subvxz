and it went down in my district.

01:03:48.575 --> 01:03:51.875
Look, man, I know it's a terrible thing,
and my heart bleeds for you,

01:03:51.995 --> 01:03:53.497
but don't take it out on the street.

01:03:53.621 --> 01:03:54.793
Let me do my job.

01:03:54.914 --> 01:03:57.713
Hey, what are you talkin' about?
I'm not a violent guy.

01:03:57.834 --> 01:04:00.007
You know me.
I wouldn't do nothing like that.

DOORMAN: [Chuckles]
Don't listen to him.

01:04:01.629 --> 01:04:03.927
Yesterday, him and a cook were waiting
for me to get off of work.

01:04:04.049 --> 01:04:05.722
They were gonna make me
tomorrow's veal chops.

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:07.094
- You know what I mean?
- Look at this fuckin' rat.

01:04:07.218 --> 01:04:08.435
He's got diarrhea of the mouth again.

01:04:08.553 --> 01:04:10.521
Hey, listen.
I always kept my mouth shut.

01:04:10.638 --> 01:04:11.730
I don't want no trouble.

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:14.977
The time you put car wax on a roast
duck 'cause you ran out of glaze?

01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:16.728

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:18.400
Health hazards?
You know what I'm talking about?

01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:20.615
I never said nothing.
But last night, that's it.

01:04:20.732 --> 01:04:22.734
I hurt my arm on the door.

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:25.078
Let me tell you something.
You see this fuckin' rat?

01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:26.993
On account of him, my girl is dead.

01:04:27.113 --> 01:04:29.161
You know where he was
when my girl got murdered?

01:04:29.282 --> 01:04:32.206
When that degenerate dirtbag took her
out of the alleyway and killed her?

01:04:32.327 --> 01:04:34.705
The only fuckin' thing
I ever loved in my life,

01:04:34.829 --> 01:04:37.002

for 20 minutes throwing up?

- Fuckin' rat. I'd like to choke you.

01:04:47.467 --> 01:04:48.389
I'm gonna say this again.

Hey, don't point your fuckin' hand
in my face.

01:04:49.761 --> 01:04:51.604

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:53.769
- And not so nice!
- Say what you want to say.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:56.109
Don't step on my toes.
Is that clear?

01:04:56.226 --> 01:04:57.773
Yeah. It's clear.

01:04:57.894 --> 01:05:01.649

You wrinkled my collar.

<i>Mm-hmm. Some 'gob.</i>

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:05.986
I should have known better
than to get involved with Italians.

01:05:06.111 --> 01:05:09.832
Everybody's a hotheaded gangster.
Everybody's Mr. Mafia.

01:05:09.948 --> 01:05:12.827

01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:19.048
Your stinkin' restaurant.

- Huh?

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:26.347
What are you trying to do?
I can't protect you 24 hours a day.

01:05:28.299 --> 01:05:31.269
No, they got
a witness protection program

01:05:31.386 --> 01:05:32.979
where you enroll and...

01:05:34.347 --> 01:05:37.521
No, it's like I --
I turn in evidence for you.

01:05:37.642 --> 01:05:38.859
You know what I mean?

01:05:38.977 --> 01:05:40.524
Hold on to Duran as long as you can.

01:05:40.645 --> 01:05:42.488

a federal thing or something or...

Well, I'll tell you something.

I think so. Yeah.

Kevin, your purpose in life
isn't taking care of me, all right?

That's another thing, Freddie.
Why don't you lay the fuck off her?

out of it.

Well, you know
what you've done, Kevin?

01:12:10.868 --> 01:12:13.838
You've given me a meaning in life.
You've given me a goal.
