of accidents and disease,

02:49.430 --> 02:51.736
there was one thing
above all that sent terror

02:51.823 --> 02:54.130

We gotta head west somewhere,

to get a better crossing?

04:53.162 --> 04:56.557
- You're going a ways.

04:56.644 --> 04:59.734
Hundred miles or more.

04:59.821 --> 05:01.692
And where it runs

No water.

05:40.644 --> 05:42.646

two weeks behind.

05:45.257 --> 05:47.303
I'll drown them if we cross here

05:47.390 --> 05:49.436

if we head west.

05:49.523 --> 05:52.613

good as it is, Captain.

05:52.700 --> 05:55.398
And we ain't even
left Texas yet.

05:55.485 --> 05:58.227

but I ain't here
and I know it ain't east.

06:06.670 --> 06:09.543
- If we head west
we're crossing the Brazos.

- Ain't no good options,
Captain.

06:11.196 --> 06:15.070

is the worst option.

to sneak up on something

or find a dumb deer.

Maybe you farm

Or you said yes
and she already regrets it.

She's having a hard time of it.

17:10.986 --> 17:13.206
Ya!

17:21.562 --> 17:23.868
Go east. Go south.

17:23.955 --> 17:26.610
Go any way but my way.

17:26.697 --> 17:28.438
If I see you again,
I'm gonna kill you.

17:40.972 --> 17:42.974
I thought you were in charge.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.411
- I am in charge.

17:44.498 --> 17:46.935
- Then act like it.
Police your people.

17:47.022 --> 17:48.589
- These are not my people.

17:48.676 --> 17:50.417
I don't control them.
No one does.

17:50.504 --> 17:52.549
- If you don't control them
then you aren't in charge.

17:52.636 --> 17:55.596
I will find someone else.

17:55.683 --> 17:58.033
- You don't decide these things.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.165
This is a free country.

17:59.252 --> 18:01.254
- That's a free country.

18:01.341 --> 18:03.386
That is Comanche land.

18:03.473 --> 18:06.215
Beyond it is no man's land
and that's where we're going...

18:06.302 --> 18:07.956
You ain't free yet.

18:09.871 --> 18:12.874
[indistinct chatter]

18:12.961 --> 18:14.615
- You all right?

18:14.702 --> 18:16.051
- Peachy.

18:16.138 --> 18:19.010
- That wasn't very peachy.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.883
Captain...

18:21.970 --> 18:22.971
Shea.

18:25.408 --> 18:28.281
These folks here
gots to trust us.

18:28.368 --> 18:31.197
If they don't trust us
they won't follow us--

18:31.284 --> 18:32.328
- Trust us?

18:32.415 --> 18:35.331
They can't even
trust each other.

18:35.418 --> 18:37.246
- It's a bad way
to start the trip.

18:37.333 --> 18:38.421
- The trip's already started,

18:38.508 --> 18:41.250
and it's been bad
from the beginning.

18:41.337 --> 18:43.034
- You having second thoughts?

18:43.122 --> 18:44.123
- You're gonna tell me
you ain't?

18:44.210 --> 18:45.907
- Yeah, I'm having 'em...

18:45.994 --> 18:48.736
But...

18:48.823 --> 18:51.347
I figure maybe if...

18:51.434 --> 18:53.610
one of their kids
has a kid

18:53.697 --> 18:58.354
and that kid
does something...

18:58.441 --> 19:01.357
something that...

19:01.444 --> 19:05.927
The world's better
'cause that kid's in it.

19:06.014 --> 19:07.537
Know what I mean?

19:07.624 --> 19:10.540
- World ain't getting
better, Thomas.

19:10.627 --> 19:12.325
No matter how
many kids are in it.

- Woo.

19:24.685 --> 19:26.513
One for me.
One for you.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.558
- Think that one's taken.

19:28.645 --> 19:30.908
And her husband don't
look too fun to fight.

19:30.995 --> 19:33.563
I'd keep that in mind when
you're chasing his daughter.

19:33.650 --> 19:36.523
- Well, good looks run
in the family, I see.

19:36.610 --> 19:38.307
- Good manners don't seem
to run in yours.

19:38.394 --> 19:41.136
We should push these
cattle to water,

19:41.223 --> 19:42.268
then hold 'em tight
for the night.

19:42.355 --> 19:43.834
- That's the plan.

19:43.921 --> 19:45.053
Just waiting on
the cowboys to do it.

out of excuses.

19:52.930 --> 19:56.064
- Guess this outfit's got a
new cow boss and it ain't us.

19:56.151 --> 19:58.066
- She could boss the President.

19:58.153 --> 20:00.242
- Hm. The President
could probably use it.
[clicks tongue]

20:02.810 --> 20:05.900
- Nothing sharp to say today?

20:05.987 --> 20:08.772

and it got snapped back at me.

20:08.859 --> 20:11.427
- Hm. That's all it
takes to rattle you?

20:12.515 --> 20:14.082

20:14.169 --> 20:16.998
- My gosh, you're forward.

20:17.085 --> 20:18.826
- Look who's blushing now.

20:18.913 --> 20:21.350
- Are you saying
I made you blush?

20:21.437 --> 20:25.049
- Maybe you made me blush.

20:25.136 --> 20:28.009
- Well, you have terrible

You ain't a man.

20:32.753 --> 20:33.667
You're just a boy.

- Just a boy.

Kinda mean the way she does it,
but she is flirtin'.

21:19.365 --> 21:22.324
- Shhh.

21:22.411 --> 21:23.891
- Can we whisper?

21:23.978 --> 21:26.981
- We can't talk at all
'cause they'll hear us.

21:27.068 --> 21:28.983
- They can't hear the horse?

21:29.070 --> 21:31.594
- They can hear the horse.
They're just not scared of it.

21:31.681 --> 21:33.596
- How come?

21:33.683 --> 21:36.425
- Well, 'cause
horses don't shoot deer.

21:36.512 --> 21:39.472
- But we're on the horse
and we shoot deer.

21:39.559 --> 21:41.778
- Well, that's why we
gotta be quiet.

21:41.865 --> 21:44.041

on the horse?

they just don't understand it.

- They don't understand
we're sitting on a horse?

21:51.092 --> 21:54.574
- They don't understand
why we're siting on a horse.

21:54.661 --> 21:57.141
- If they understood
why we're sitting on a horse,

21:57.228 --> 21:59.492
they would head for the hills.

21:59.579 --> 22:03.496
'Course, we're in the hills so

Shh.

Lean in here.

Not on it.
Till I tell you.

22:52.240 --> 22:53.720
- Is it going to kick?

22:53.807 --> 22:58.638
- It's gonna kick.
And it's gonna hurt.

22:58.725 --> 23:00.204
But you won't remember
the kick in a week.

23:00.291 --> 23:01.249
All you'll remember is the kill.

23:01.336 --> 23:03.294
Look through there.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.819
Put the cross hairs right
behind his shoulder.

23:05.906 --> 23:06.820
- Yes, sir.

- Yes, sir.

on the trigger.

so I gotta blood you.

There we go.

You took a life to give us life.

24:26.465 --> 24:27.683
So now we say thank you.

- To who?

24:29.990 --> 24:31.470
- To the deer.

24:31.557 --> 24:35.343
- But the deer's dead.
He can't hear us.

24:35.430 --> 24:37.301
- Well, we say thank you anyway.

24:37.388 --> 24:39.390
- How do we say thank you?

24:39.478 --> 24:41.131
- We just say it.

24:43.177 --> 24:44.526
- Thank you.

24:50.619 --> 24:52.795
- When you kill a thing, son,

24:52.882 --> 24:55.015
it makes you
a little less man,

24:55.102 --> 24:57.844
a little more animal.

Now we try to find the balance
between them.

That's all life is.

of stoking it.

If I take them east,

26:01.298 --> 26:03.910
it adds three weeks to the trip
the way they're moving.

Puts us at South Pass
in October.

with the Brazos.

and you're not helping.

are out there right now

26:38.074 --> 26:40.250
You questioned my authority
and I cannot have it.

26:40.337 --> 26:42.426
- I questioned going east
and now we're going west

26:42.513 --> 26:43.950
and I was right to question.

I ain't one of your patrons.

a shit about is mine.

every bandit

27:12.326 --> 27:15.416
You go first, and I'll follow
you with the herd.

- Fair enough.

27:24.817 --> 27:25.774
- Come here, John.

- I always thought of mothers
like nervous chickens,

28:03.203 --> 28:06.293
too worried about their clutch
to ever hunt for a worm.

28:06.380 --> 28:09.818
In my mind,
my mother was a banker,

28:09.905 --> 28:12.473
hoarding my freedom
like money.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.605
I never once thought
of her as a woman

28:14.693 --> 28:17.652
with desires and
dreams and passion,

28:17.739 --> 28:20.829
though passion
is the thing that made me.

28:20.916 --> 28:23.179
I lie awake at night

28:23.266 --> 28:26.792
and my dreams for this
life burn inside me

28:26.879 --> 28:29.969
as if I'd walked to the
campfire and tried to eat it.

28:32.058 --> 28:35.670
I watched my mother
and I felt foolish for thinking

28:35.757 --> 28:38.673
the notion of eating
fire was mine alone.

28:38.760 --> 28:41.720
It was hers first.

28:41.807 --> 28:42.938
Then she gave it to me.

28:49.858 --> 28:52.208
I watched her ride
and I didn't see my mother.

28:53.514 --> 28:54.602
I saw a woman.

28:58.867 --> 29:00.695
And the woman was magnificent.

Destroy my wagon.

29:26.460 --> 29:28.854
Strand me here, for what?

29:30.551 --> 29:33.032
For some gypsy whore!

29:33.119 --> 29:34.729
- You stole from her.

29:34.816 --> 29:37.123
- I stole back
what her husband took.

29:37.210 --> 29:39.473
- And now he's in the ground.

29:39.560 --> 29:41.562
- Where he belongs.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.656
- What do you want me to do?

29:48.743 --> 29:50.745
- We don't need them.

29:50.832 --> 29:53.139
We go north to mountain,
west to ocean.

29:53.226 --> 29:56.142
We don't need guide for that.

29:56.229 --> 30:00.842
- We need him.
We need him for protection.

30:00.929 --> 30:03.453
- Who he protect?
Huh?

30:06.152 --> 30:10.286
Not Stefan, not David,
not Luca.

30:10.373 --> 30:13.028
Alexandria, Daria?

30:13.115 --> 30:14.595
No...

30:14.682 --> 30:16.553
Just the whore.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.255
- She's a mother.
- [spits]

30:22.342 --> 30:24.431
- We can find the way
without them.

30:24.518 --> 30:28.652

During the war...

31:34.022 --> 31:37.417
we fought a battle at this place
called the wilderness,

31:37.504 --> 31:42.944
'cause there was nothing
around but wilderness.

31:43.031 --> 31:47.688
I fired my rifle so many
times the barrel melted,

31:47.775 --> 31:51.344
just drooped like rotten fruit.

31:51.431 --> 31:54.086
So, I killed with my pistol.

31:54.173 --> 31:56.523
And when I ran out of bullets
I killed with my sword.

31:56.610 --> 32:01.093
And when my sword broke I killed
with my boots and bare hands.

nothing to me, I mean it.
