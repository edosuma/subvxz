WEBVTT

00:01.831 --> 00:02.991
Move to the wall!

00:05.351 --> 00:07.031
... so we can finally
get on with our lives.

00:08.711 --> 00:09.991
Vinnie Holt left the courtroom

00:10.071 --> 00:11.671
and returned to his Bacchus Marsh compound.

00:11.751 --> 00:13.351
Check out the fresh tart!

00:14.991 --> 00:16.151
Don't fucking flaunt her in public.

00:16.231 --> 00:17.751
You know what that does to me in here?

00:23.191 --> 00:24.431
They're gonna gang her.

00:24.671 --> 00:25.791
What... What's that?

00:26.991 --> 00:27.991
Rape.

00:28.351 --> 00:29.391
Please don't do this.

00:29.791 --> 00:30.831
You know it's not right.

00:31.311 --> 00:32.391
You've got guts.

00:33.231 --> 00:34.951
Coming in here, airing your opinions.

00:36.591 --> 00:38.191
No one else has been
brave enough to do that.

00:41.671 --> 00:42.871
I'm so sorry, Bea.

00:47.711 --> 00:48.951
I just came here to work out.

00:49.671 --> 00:50.711
This one's for Bea.

00:54.631 --> 00:57.751
You want to see your daughter?
You tell me what happened.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:19.631 --> 03:21.951
It's been three weeks. How are you feeling?

03:22.311 --> 03:24.111
Fine. Have been for a while now.

03:25.271 --> 03:27.551
Not really enough to warrant
staying in medical this long.

03:28.831 --> 03:29.951
It was for your own good.

03:31.071 --> 03:33.871
Keeping me locked away is not gonna
change what happens when I get out.

03:35.271 --> 03:36.271
No.

03:37.511 --> 03:38.991
At least you're smart enough to admit it.

03:39.071 --> 03:40.391
Seven years at the top.

03:41.591 --> 03:43.671
Nobody gets there without
making a few enemies.

03:43.751 --> 03:45.951
You certainly don't stay there
without making a few more.

03:46.831 --> 03:48.951
Isn't it nice how much we have in common?

03:51.991 --> 03:54.111
I haven't heard much talk
of you on the compound.

03:54.831 --> 03:55.831
It worries me.

03:56.951 --> 03:59.191
Personal concern from the
Governor. I'm flattered.

03:59.951 --> 04:03.191
The officers have also noticed a
significant change in the women,

04:03.631 --> 04:04.911
who they're looking to.

04:05.711 --> 04:06.871
That's to be expected.

04:07.391 --> 04:09.711
Once I'm back in the unit,
things will right themselves.

04:11.791 --> 04:13.511
I'd like you to agree to go into protection

04:13.591 --> 04:15.031
for the remainder of your sentence.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.190
It will ensure your safety.

04:19.831 --> 04:22.031
Make sure you walk out of
here when your time ends.

04:24.151 --> 04:25.671
If you don't take my offer,

04:26.471 --> 04:28.431
I can't guarantee how long you'll last.

04:39.391 --> 04:41.911
No one takes a hit out on Vinnie
Holt and gets away with it.

04:42.711 --> 04:43.831
I'll rip his fucking heart out

04:43.911 --> 04:45.071
and shove it down his throat.

04:45.431 --> 04:46.871
I've enjoyed our little chat.

04:49.671 --> 04:50.831
Thank you, Governor.

04:57.991 --> 05:00.871
We'll introduce random spot checks
throughout the day, every day.

05:01.191 --> 05:03.311
H2 and H4 are our main focus.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.151
We need to know where these
women are at all times.

05:11.511 --> 05:12.551
Hey.

05:14.431 --> 05:15.911
- Bea?
- Hey.

05:17.231 --> 05:20.511
- Are you still feeling the love?
- It'll wear off.

05:25.031 --> 05:27.311
If they're in the visitors' center,
I want them monitored closely.

05:27.391 --> 05:29.231
I want all calls to be recorded.

05:29.671 --> 05:32.871
If there is anything
remotely out of the ordinary,

05:32.951 --> 05:34.791
I want it logged into the daily report.

05:35.871 --> 05:37.031
Hey, Bea.

05:39.351 --> 05:41.311
Hey. I cleaned out the canteen.

05:41.391 --> 05:45.031
I got popcorn, I got biscuits
and I got a whole load of tissues!

05:45.111 --> 05:46.831
Aw, you're such a softie!

05:46.911 --> 05:48.511
It's my new favorite show now.

05:49.231 --> 05:50.351
I knew you'd like it.

06:05.991 --> 06:07.191
There will be reprisals.

06:07.911 --> 06:09.671
We know that's how Jacs and Franky work.

06:10.431 --> 06:11.911
What we don't know

06:11.991 --> 06:14.991
is how the game changes now that
there's a new player in the mix.

06:53.871 --> 06:55.031
I'm not getting involved.

06:55.711 --> 06:57.831
The only way we come out of
this is if we strike first.

06:59.471 --> 07:00.751
Then it just starts all over again.

07:01.391 --> 07:02.631
Until what, someone dies?

07:03.591 --> 07:04.911
I don't plan on dying.

07:06.711 --> 07:08.111
Why do you want to be in that position?

07:09.591 --> 07:11.271
It's better than being a weak piece of shit

07:11.351 --> 07:13.111
that everyone walks over, isn't it, Red?

07:15.911 --> 07:17.591
- Why do you want it?
- I don't.

07:19.911 --> 07:20.911
Don't you?

07:27.111 --> 07:28.151
Let's go.

07:48.071 --> 07:50.591
- I kept it warm for you.
- Thanks, Simmo.

07:55.111 --> 07:56.391
It's good to be back.

08:05.511 --> 08:07.871
- Stop her.
- Let her go. Just let her go.

08:07.951 --> 08:09.191
- Stop her.
- No, come on.

08:11.671 --> 08:12.671
Okay.

08:16.911 --> 08:18.991
- How's the hand?
- Fine.

08:22.511 --> 08:23.831
I didn't want anyone to get hurt.

08:24.551 --> 08:25.951
What else did you think would happen?

08:26.391 --> 08:28.511
If I knew you were gonna get hurt,
I would have tried to stop that too.

08:30.871 --> 08:33.111
This was never about taking sides.

08:35.751 --> 08:37.951
I just didn't think what
you were gonna do was right.

08:39.030 --> 08:41.191
Now all I wanna do is go
home and be with my daughter.

08:43.910 --> 08:44.911
Mum?

08:50.631 --> 08:52.551
We all do what we have to in here.

08:53.591 --> 08:55.791
I'm glad your conscience is clear, Bea.

09:08.511 --> 09:09.671
Hey, I've gotta call my mum.

09:09.751 --> 09:11.911
- Say happy birthday from me.
- Sure.

09:11.991 --> 09:13.111
No smiles?

09:16.231 --> 09:18.111
Just give us one. Come on, one smile!

09:18.351 --> 09:19.871
- Franky...
- Yeah.

09:21.511 --> 09:22.951
Why didn't you stop Bea?

09:23.831 --> 09:25.951
Bea and Jacqueline needed space
to work through their problems.

09:26.031 --> 09:28.231
Yeah, well, she stuck her
neck out for you again.

09:28.471 --> 09:30.671
Yeah, and she'll always have a
special place in here for that.

09:30.871 --> 09:32.871
You're stronger with Bea than without her.

09:32.951 --> 09:35.071
And a smart girl like you should know that.

09:40.391 --> 09:42.511
You know these spot
checks are a waste of time.

09:43.071 --> 09:46.311
Keeps them on their toes.
While we're run off our feet.

09:47.631 --> 09:49.831
You know, Erica wants all
this extra surveillance,

09:50.511 --> 09:52.551
but is she offering up any
extra officers to do it?

09:52.631 --> 09:54.071
Mate, you know how it works.

09:54.431 --> 09:56.351
Well, I know since she's become governor,

09:56.871 --> 09:59.471
everything she does makes her
look good while we cop the shit.

09:59.711 --> 10:00.831
That's the job.

10:01.551 --> 10:04.311
It never happened on Meg's watch,
or any of the other governors'.

10:04.551 --> 10:06.431
That doesn't mean it's the wrong way to go.

10:06.511 --> 10:08.711
It's just, Erica works different that way.

10:09.231 --> 10:10.631
I thought you'd be all over this.

10:11.071 --> 10:13.991
She's right about the women.
You know how tense it is.

10:14.071 --> 10:15.871
So throw them in the slot, right?

10:15.951 --> 10:17.431
We'll keep 'em locked
up in their units longer.

10:17.511 --> 10:19.511
- Yeah, well, that's not going to happen.
- That's the way I'd play it.

10:20.431 --> 10:23.111
Look, if you've got a better
way of handling the situation,

10:23.191 --> 10:24.191
talk to Erica.

10:26.151 --> 10:29.271
Yeah. Then suck it up like the rest of us.

10:29.351 --> 10:31.311
- Later.
- Later.

10:37.951 --> 10:39.191
Spot check.

10:40.111 --> 10:41.791
Please, be my guest.

10:50.351 --> 10:51.551
Find anything you like?

10:53.591 --> 10:55.311
You're playing very nice, Jacs.

10:56.711 --> 10:57.791
What are you planning?

10:58.511 --> 11:01.631
Why don't I make us a cuppa and
we can sit down and trade stories?

11:03.511 --> 11:05.911
Yours are far more fascinating than mine.

11:07.591 --> 11:09.391
I'm sure the Governor
would be very interested

11:09.471 --> 11:11.871
to know how one of her
officers spends his spare time.

11:12.831 --> 11:14.631
Cavorting with drug dealers.

11:16.191 --> 11:17.591
I've seen the photos.

11:19.191 --> 11:21.511
You really must find a more private venue.

11:24.511 --> 11:26.031
What's your son doing with Debbie?

11:27.551 --> 11:28.671
They're in love.

11:28.751 --> 11:30.551
I reckon Bea would have
something to say about that.

11:31.151 --> 11:32.511
Just know, Mr. Jackson,

11:32.591 --> 11:34.471
I'm the one that makes
the threats around here.

11:38.351 --> 11:39.671
What's that for?

11:40.911 --> 11:43.311
Mum would actually go
off if she saw this place.

11:44.151 --> 11:45.591
She is such a neat freak.

11:46.111 --> 11:48.151
Well, lucky she's not
here to hassle you, then.

11:48.231 --> 11:49.351
She always finds a way.

11:51.431 --> 11:53.071
Do you think she still gives a shit?

11:54.791 --> 11:57.951
I mean, she keeps finding
excuses not to see you.

12:00.911 --> 12:02.191
At least your mum's different.

12:03.511 --> 12:07.551
Hmm. She's all over me because she wants
me to take over the business one day.

12:08.231 --> 12:09.271
Do you want to?

12:10.311 --> 12:11.351
Yeah.

12:17.591 --> 12:18.911
I love you, baby girl.

12:18.991 --> 12:20.671
Are you doing anything
interesting at the weekend?

12:22.231 --> 12:23.351
What about you?

12:23.591 --> 12:24.671
A quiet river.

12:24.871 --> 12:26.311
Beers, a tent and a fishing rod.

12:26.391 --> 12:27.511
That's all a man needs.

12:29.511 --> 12:32.031
- I've never been camping.
- Seriously?

12:32.511 --> 12:34.311
Oh, you're missing out, Vera.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.431
Bugs, wildlife...

12:37.111 --> 12:38.271
Squatting over a hole.

12:38.351 --> 12:39.791
See, that's music to my ears.

12:40.831 --> 12:43.671
Hey, Deb, it's Mum again.
Just trying to get hold of you.

12:49.031 --> 12:52.751
Hey, Bea. You can't have two
in a row. Back in the line.

13:02.071 --> 13:03.431
Is it the same as smoking it?

13:07.231 --> 13:08.471
No way.

13:10.551 --> 13:11.831
Do you want to try?

13:19.991 --> 13:22.151
Bea. Take my place.

13:43.311 --> 13:44.951
Do it.

13:58.391 --> 13:59.511
It's me again.

14:00.271 --> 14:02.071
I'm just wondering where you are.

14:14.631 --> 14:17.191
Hmm, showing it the
respect it deserves, I see.

14:18.591 --> 14:19.831
But, Fletch!

14:20.591 --> 14:21.991
You can eat with me, Vera.

14:23.071 --> 14:24.631
I can't eat your food!

14:25.351 --> 14:27.791
- You can't eat that rubbish.
- Well, no, no. Now I can't.

14:34.751 --> 14:37.231
- What is it?
- It's Mediterranean couscous salad.

14:39.551 --> 14:41.391
I learned to cook when I was
traveling around with the army.

14:42.431 --> 14:43.431
Looks good.

14:43.871 --> 14:46.311
I thought you guys ate a
lot of freeze-dried stuff.

14:46.511 --> 14:47.591
Not in my unit.

14:52.351 --> 14:53.631
That's really good. Thanks.

14:53.831 --> 14:57.471
You know, um, there's a Bond
movie marathon on tomorrow night.

14:58.271 --> 14:59.431
At the Palais.

15:00.551 --> 15:01.951
Yeah, I like the movies too.

15:03.671 --> 15:04.711
Maybe...

15:04.991 --> 15:06.111
I thought, maybe we could...

15:06.191 --> 15:07.871
We could just meet up there if you want.

15:09.351 --> 15:10.471
All right.

15:11.511 --> 15:12.511
All right.

15:19.231 --> 15:21.311
Bea, quick, quick, quick.
Come on, it's about to start.

15:21.391 --> 15:23.511
- We thought you'd got a visit.
- Yeah, not a chance.

15:23.591 --> 15:26.151
- All right, did you get hold of Debs?
- No, not yet.

15:26.831 --> 15:29.951
I just can't seem to catch her between,
you know, school and everything.

15:30.031 --> 15:31.031
- All right.
- Hey...

15:31.391 --> 15:33.351
I reckon he's gonna tell
her he's dying or something.

15:33.511 --> 15:34.751
Well, he's been acting pretty weird.

15:34.831 --> 15:37.751
Oh, yeah, I reckon he's trying to
blackmail Paige into not seeing Blake.

15:37.831 --> 15:40.591
That boy is so smug, I just
wanna smack him in the face.

15:41.311 --> 15:43.071
Careful, you might hurt your
hand on all that plastic!

15:44.551 --> 15:46.351
Hey, you know, you leave him alone.

15:46.791 --> 15:49.551
Oh, Booms, really?

15:49.791 --> 15:51.351
Already?

15:58.831 --> 16:00.991
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

16:01.751 --> 16:02.791
And Spitz?

16:04.551 --> 16:05.951
He'll do it after lockdown.

16:07.271 --> 16:08.311
Good.

16:15.551 --> 16:17.071
You're a good woman, Simmo.

16:20.711 --> 16:22.471
I gotta go make myself nice.

16:22.911 --> 16:24.111
Vinnie's coming.

16:28.111 --> 16:30.191
My lawyer reckons I could
be out in a few months.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.471
If you need me to take care of anything...

16:36.151 --> 16:37.431
I appreciate it.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.311
But she's just another
one with no substance.

16:40.951 --> 16:42.951
Vinnie's tarts don't last for long.

16:52.911 --> 16:54.111
Planning on a holiday, Max?

16:54.391 --> 16:55.511
Oh, damn!

16:55.871 --> 16:56.911
Yeah.

16:57.431 --> 16:59.671
Thinking about a trip to
the Greek islands, you know?

17:00.311 --> 17:01.871
Yassoo, my friends!

17:08.431 --> 17:09.711
You're behind a hit on me!

17:09.790 --> 17:11.711
No way! Why would I do that?

17:11.790 --> 17:13.191
'Cause you're a greedy little prick!

17:15.550 --> 17:17.951
Come on, Vinnie! We're
family! I wouldn't do it!

17:28.831 --> 17:29.911
Looking good, Jacs.

17:32.631 --> 17:34.911
Ah, it takes two people to escort me now.

17:35.191 --> 17:37.351
I just came down to see
how you're settling back in.

17:37.671 --> 17:38.791
Like I never left.

17:39.231 --> 17:41.191
A snapshot in time, you might say.

17:41.951 --> 17:43.551
It's a bit quieter than usual.

17:45.831 --> 17:47.751
You visit often enough to know, Governor?

17:47.831 --> 17:49.631
It's my business to know, Jacs.

17:52.351 --> 17:53.991
You'll have to visit medical tomorrow.

17:54.071 --> 17:55.631
The doctors will run some tests,

17:55.711 --> 17:57.591
see if there isn't any residual damage.

17:58.351 --> 17:59.551
If there is,

18:00.071 --> 18:01.711
we can reassess your options.

18:04.431 --> 18:06.631
Mr. Jackson will escort
you to your visitor.

18:29.311 --> 18:30.431
You look like hell.

18:31.591 --> 18:32.991
Just a few bruises.

18:36.231 --> 18:38.391
If you want something,
anything, you just let me know.

18:38.871 --> 18:41.511
I need drugs. For my arthritis.

18:43.551 --> 18:44.751
Bad?

18:45.791 --> 18:47.151
I can't cut a medical.

18:48.351 --> 18:50.151
Word will get out and
the vultures will circle.

18:50.591 --> 18:51.951
I've got a screw we can use.

18:52.031 --> 18:53.151
They'll get in touch with you.

18:53.271 --> 18:54.871
You get it and they'll bring it in.

18:57.351 --> 18:59.071
Are you taking care of who did that?

18:59.151 --> 19:00.391
You know I will.

19:00.991 --> 19:02.191
That's my Jacs.

19:04.551 --> 19:06.351
The Governor wants me in protection.

19:08.071 --> 19:09.671
Thinks things are on the downward.

19:10.271 --> 19:12.111
I'm not taking it. I'm not conceding.

19:14.831 --> 19:16.231
Good to have options.

19:18.551 --> 19:19.911
Why would I need them?

19:29.191 --> 19:30.751
Simmo's back inside.

19:32.071 --> 19:33.271
Spitz mentioned it.

19:35.391 --> 19:36.711
What's going on with her?

19:38.431 --> 19:40.711
Spitz hasn't said anything about Simmo.

19:40.911 --> 19:42.951
No, Vinnie. Her!

19:47.311 --> 19:49.431
I got my hands on a piece of
land down on the peninsula.

19:49.511 --> 19:50.711
It's been rezoned.

19:51.231 --> 19:54.391
Cass is taking care of the
planning. I'm gonna make a killing.

19:55.511 --> 19:57.831
So is she good for the
business or good in bed?

20:01.471 --> 20:02.751
I wanna marry her.

20:08.511 --> 20:09.551
You and me...

20:11.751 --> 20:13.591
Time hasn't been our friend.

20:15.431 --> 20:18.071
So you wanna wind back
the clock with some slut?

20:18.551 --> 20:20.231
I can't wait another seven years!

20:21.191 --> 20:23.791
- I'm your wife.
- I love her.

20:24.191 --> 20:25.871
It's your dick talking!

20:29.391 --> 20:31.591
I've got my lawyer
drawing up divorce papers.

20:35.071 --> 20:37.871
- I can have her taken out!
- Oh, Jacs...

20:39.831 --> 20:41.591
You don't have any reach outside anymore.

20:41.671 --> 20:43.831
The only power you have
is in here. I'm sorry.

20:44.471 --> 20:48.071
Seven years I've been in here with
another seven to go because of you,

20:48.151 --> 20:50.151
and all you can say is, you're sorry?

20:55.711 --> 20:57.791
I'll make sure you get your
medication, anything you need.

21:00.311 --> 21:03.271
But you might wanna reconsider
the Governor's offer.

21:08.151 --> 21:10.071
Tell Brayden to come and see me.

21:15.311 --> 21:16.551
Jacs?

21:22.871 --> 21:23.911
All done?

21:27.031 --> 21:28.111
I wanna marry her.

21:28.191 --> 21:31.071
I'd like you to go into protection
for the rest of your sentence.

21:31.591 --> 21:32.991
Time hasn't been our friend.

21:33.071 --> 21:34.551
Seven years at the top.

21:34.631 --> 21:36.911
Nobody gets there without
making a few enemies.

21:36.991 --> 21:38.831
You certainly don't stay there
without making a few more.

21:38.911 --> 21:40.511
You don't have any reach outside anymore.

21:40.591 --> 21:42.471
The only power you have
is in here. I'm sorry.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.511
I haven't heard much talk
of you on the compound.

21:46.431 --> 21:47.551
It worries me.

21:54.191 --> 21:55.551
I'm dying!

21:55.631 --> 21:56.871
Oh, my...

21:56.951 --> 21:58.551
It was so...

22:20.991 --> 22:24.071
Heard the laughter. Didn't
wanna miss out on all the fun.

22:25.511 --> 22:28.751
- Why don't you get out, Jacqueline?
- That's not very nice.

22:29.591 --> 22:31.591
Obviously having a bit of a get-together.

22:31.871 --> 22:33.591
There are women here from the other units.

22:33.951 --> 22:35.671
Yeah. And you're not invited.

22:36.351 --> 22:38.271
Francesca, your manners are appalling.

22:38.831 --> 22:42.151
Get the fuck out.

22:43.671 --> 22:46.951
Jacs? What are you doing here?

22:47.751 --> 22:50.431
I was trying to make conversation,
but it's a bit limited.

22:53.111 --> 22:54.911
Be a good man and escort me home.

23:00.391 --> 23:01.951
I'll be back for lock-in, ladies.

23:02.391 --> 23:03.471
All right.

23:04.031 --> 23:06.751
Maybe we'll find something
interesting to chat about on the way.

23:37.711 --> 23:38.751
Hello.

23:38.831 --> 23:39.911
Is this Bea Smith?

23:40.271 --> 23:41.351
Who's this?

23:41.431 --> 23:43.791
I'm one of the guys having
fun with young Debbie.

23:43.871 --> 23:44.951
Who's this?

23:45.031 --> 23:47.551
Deb's a good girl, great
fuck, or so the others tell me.

23:47.631 --> 23:48.751
I can't wait to have a go.

23:49.071 --> 23:51.191
Who the hell are you? Keep
your hands off my daughter!

23:51.631 --> 23:53.751
- Debbie?
- No. Deb can't talk right now.

23:53.831 --> 23:55.351
She's got a mouthful,
if you know what I mean?

23:55.431 --> 23:57.151
You keep your hands off my daughter!

23:57.231 --> 23:58.311
Bea, are you all right?

23:58.391 --> 23:59.431
See you later, Bea.

23:59.511 --> 24:01.071
Hello? Shit.

24:01.151 --> 24:02.511
Where did you get the phone?

24:04.151 --> 24:05.271
Sorry, Liz.

24:09.271 --> 24:11.311
Some guy on the end of the phone.

24:11.391 --> 24:12.511
They've got to her!

24:12.711 --> 24:14.831
No, no, no.

24:14.911 --> 24:15.951
Listen to me.

24:16.031 --> 24:17.591
Debbie is fine.

24:17.671 --> 24:19.591
Jacs is messing with you!

24:19.671 --> 24:21.191
No, she's not. It's some
guy and he's hurting her!

24:21.271 --> 24:23.431
Trust me. I know how
it works in here right.

24:23.511 --> 24:24.591
You push that button,

24:24.671 --> 24:27.671
the screws will come and find you
with the phone and they will slot you.

24:27.951 --> 24:28.991
You know that.

24:29.071 --> 24:30.111
I don't know that.

24:30.191 --> 24:33.271
I'm telling you. Jacs has
done it before, love. Okay?

24:33.551 --> 24:34.591
I've seen it.

24:34.871 --> 24:37.751
So if you push that button, she wins.

24:38.591 --> 24:40.151
Debbie is fine, love.

24:40.871 --> 24:42.031
Okay?

24:56.031 --> 24:57.991
Jacs knows how to get
to you and you let her.

24:58.071 --> 25:00.311
What are you doing about it, huh? Nothing.

25:00.391 --> 25:02.871
Ooh! You better be careful, Red.

25:03.191 --> 25:04.631
I said I'd take care of you.

25:04.711 --> 25:05.831
Debbie's your problem.

25:06.151 --> 25:07.751
Debbie's not a problem? She's my daughter.

25:07.831 --> 25:08.951
She's your daughter.

25:09.111 --> 25:11.231
We know. Don't we?

25:12.431 --> 25:13.471
Jacs knows.

25:14.871 --> 25:16.991
So it's something you're gonna
have to sort out with her.

25:32.231 --> 25:33.711
Are you all right?

25:35.751 --> 25:37.511
I'm looking forward to the movies.

26:05.151 --> 26:06.471
Bloody underwire bras!

26:19.311 --> 26:20.431
Will.

26:22.551 --> 26:23.591
Morning.

26:23.671 --> 26:24.711
- How are you?
- Good.

26:38.431 --> 26:39.791
- Come on.
- Oh.

26:49.751 --> 26:51.551
Belt. Again.

27:04.871 --> 27:06.071
You're late.

27:17.831 --> 27:19.111
Give it to me.

27:47.951 --> 27:50.471
This is the first and last
time, Jacs. I won't do it again.

27:50.551 --> 27:51.671
Yes, you will.

27:52.991 --> 27:54.311
Every time I ask.

28:01.271 --> 28:02.711
This job is my life.

28:03.191 --> 28:05.151
Which is why you're in this position, Vera.

28:08.271 --> 28:09.511
I don't want to do this.

28:09.791 --> 28:11.431
When you ask a favor,

28:12.831 --> 28:14.711
there's a good chance
you'll have to repay it.

28:15.071 --> 28:17.671
And when that day comes, it's
too late to change your mind.

28:20.391 --> 28:22.591
Do you really want the
Governor to know what you did?

28:26.231 --> 28:27.511
She won't believe you.

28:29.231 --> 28:31.471
If you're confident of
that, you wouldn't be here.

28:35.271 --> 28:36.791
No one was supposed to get hurt.

28:37.151 --> 28:39.951
I asked you to start a small
fight that I could handle.

28:40.031 --> 28:41.351
So you could save the day!

28:41.471 --> 28:43.511
So Meg could see that I was good at my job.

28:44.831 --> 28:45.951
Hmm.

28:46.391 --> 28:48.911
How easily a fight turns into a riot.

28:51.351 --> 28:53.431
I suppose neither of you came out ahead.

28:54.151 --> 28:55.471
Jacs, I...

28:57.391 --> 28:59.711
I have always shown you respect.

29:02.471 --> 29:04.311
Please don't make me do this.

29:07.271 --> 29:08.911
You will give me what I need!

29:10.151 --> 29:12.831
Or you'll end up trading in your
grays for this lovely shade of teal.

29:12.911 --> 29:15.151
And I might not be so nice to you then.

29:44.271 --> 29:45.671
What's up? Are you all right?

29:45.751 --> 29:47.191
- I can't...
- Can't breathe!

29:47.631 --> 29:50.511
Sit. Here, sit down. There you go.

29:51.111 --> 29:53.911
One hand on your heart, one hand
on your stomach, and look at me.

29:53.991 --> 29:56.511
Focus on my eyes, okay.
Now breathe into your hand,

29:57.151 --> 30:00.071
and out through your stomach. Focus on me.

30:00.151 --> 30:03.591
Into your heart and out
through your stomach.

30:03.791 --> 30:05.271
Focus on me.

30:05.351 --> 30:08.391
Now breathe in. And out. That's it.

30:08.951 --> 30:10.071
Deep breaths.

30:18.151 --> 30:19.311
What happened?

30:19.711 --> 30:22.071
It's nothing. I just, I...

30:24.471 --> 30:27.591
It just gets to me sometimes.
I just should know better.

30:27.911 --> 30:29.191
Yes, you should.

30:29.991 --> 30:32.751
You're too nice to them,
Vera. They take advantage.

30:36.231 --> 30:37.391
No, they don't.

30:38.911 --> 30:40.751
You think everyone in here is the victim.

30:41.311 --> 30:42.871
But they know right from wrong.

30:43.271 --> 30:44.711
They just don't give a shit.

30:46.111 --> 30:47.951
Everyone goes through
rough patches in life.

30:48.671 --> 30:51.071
You've got to decide how
you deal with it, you know?

30:51.791 --> 30:53.031
Hurt people,

30:53.391 --> 30:54.791
break the law,

30:54.871 --> 30:56.271
or do it the hard way.

30:56.631 --> 30:57.911
How we handle it.

30:59.231 --> 31:01.951
That's why we deserve to be
part of society and they don't.

31:06.151 --> 31:08.351
Would you remind me not
to get on your bad side?

31:09.791 --> 31:11.071
I think you're pretty safe.

31:13.711 --> 31:15.591
You're a good person, Vera.

31:17.311 --> 31:18.831
Don't let them get to you.

31:34.111 --> 31:35.751
- All clear.
- Clear.

31:36.391 --> 31:38.031
- You're free to go.
- Thank you.

31:39.031 --> 31:40.311
Walking speed.

32:03.991 --> 32:05.071
Harry?

32:05.151 --> 32:06.191
Hello.

32:06.271 --> 32:07.311
Deb!

32:07.511 --> 32:08.631
Are you all right?

32:09.391 --> 32:10.511
I'm fine.

32:12.831 --> 32:15.111
I was calling you all day
yesterday. Why didn't you pick up?

32:15.391 --> 32:16.511
Where were you?

32:16.991 --> 32:18.071
Who were you with?

32:18.471 --> 32:19.711
Can you stop hassling me?

32:20.071 --> 32:21.471
I've just been worried, that's all.

32:21.711 --> 32:22.991
I said I'm fine.

32:23.311 --> 32:26.511
Well... Can you tell me what's going on?

32:26.791 --> 32:28.031
I just feel like you're avoiding me.

32:28.111 --> 32:29.311
You can talk.

32:30.671 --> 32:31.791
What...

32:31.871 --> 32:33.271
What's that supposed to mean?

32:34.351 --> 32:36.551
Whenever I talk to you,
you just go off on me

32:36.631 --> 32:39.031
and whenever I try and visit,
you don't even want to see me.

32:41.351 --> 32:44.431
I told you, I had an accident
and I wasn't allowed visitors.

32:44.511 --> 32:46.751
What kind of accident takes
three weeks to get over?

32:47.111 --> 32:48.711
If you don't trust me anymore

32:48.791 --> 32:50.671
and if you don't want to
see me, then just say it.

32:57.871 --> 32:59.151
I was beaten up.

33:03.591 --> 33:05.311
How badly? Are you okay?

33:05.751 --> 33:06.991
Yeah, I'm okay now.

33:07.631 --> 33:10.191
I looked pretty messy. I just
didn't want to scare you, that's all.

33:13.471 --> 33:15.671
I'm so sorry, Mum. This is all my fault!

33:16.271 --> 33:17.591
No. Hey...

33:18.831 --> 33:20.271
You've done nothing wrong.

33:21.711 --> 33:22.831
Why would you think that?

33:24.911 --> 33:26.591
You stayed with Dad because of me.

33:28.511 --> 33:30.551
Oh, honey, no.

33:32.711 --> 33:33.751
No.

33:34.511 --> 33:37.031
I didn't stay with your dad because of you.

33:38.591 --> 33:39.671
I was just...

33:40.151 --> 33:41.511
Too scared to leave him.

33:42.551 --> 33:43.751
I, uh...

33:44.031 --> 33:48.071
I was silly enough to think that it was
better for you if we stayed together.

33:50.671 --> 33:52.351
Deb, this is a tough time for us.

33:52.831 --> 33:54.071
We're gonna get through this.

33:55.231 --> 33:56.351
Okay?

34:01.631 --> 34:02.671
Are you there still?

34:04.711 --> 34:05.711
Yes.

34:08.431 --> 34:09.831
Darling, don't cry.

34:11.311 --> 34:12.831
I miss you so much.

34:12.911 --> 34:14.391
I miss you too, Mum.

34:16.311 --> 34:17.551
It's going to be all right.

34:20.031 --> 34:22.831
I want to ask you a favor.
Can you do something for me?

34:25.110 --> 34:28.791
I want you to just keep
talking to me, all right?

34:29.710 --> 34:30.911
I will.

34:32.311 --> 34:34.630
I love you to the moon and back.

34:35.831 --> 34:36.911
I love you, too.

34:59.071 --> 35:00.431
So what's next, Jacs?

35:00.911 --> 35:02.031
It's polite to knock.

35:02.111 --> 35:04.671
Oh, you're gonna have to do a hell
of a lot better than planting a phone.

35:05.311 --> 35:06.711
I don't know what you're talking about.

35:06.791 --> 35:08.071
You wanna have a go at me?

35:08.511 --> 35:11.351
Then have a go at me. Don't
you dare use my family to do it.

35:11.831 --> 35:14.351
It's dangerous to jump to
conclusions in here, Bea.

35:15.311 --> 35:16.591
You put yourself in the mix.

35:16.991 --> 35:18.511
The women are looking to you now.

35:19.231 --> 35:22.231
I'm sure Francesca isn't happy with
the way you're still on the spotlight.

35:34.511 --> 35:36.791
Do you, uh... Do you want
to grab a drink after work?

35:37.311 --> 35:38.831
Oh, yeah, yeah. Has to
be a quick one, though.

35:38.911 --> 35:40.671
I'm going to the movies tonight.

35:41.151 --> 35:42.391
Vera?

35:44.991 --> 35:45.991
Good for you.

35:50.071 --> 35:52.631
Franky? Governor wants to see you.

35:52.991 --> 35:54.431
She's a bit busy at the moment.

35:54.751 --> 35:55.751
Sorry.

35:57.551 --> 35:59.111
Miss Davidson wants to see you now.

36:01.071 --> 36:02.751
Miss Davidson's insatiable.

36:04.031 --> 36:06.631
So I heard you and Bea
were paid a visit yesterday.

36:07.271 --> 36:08.391
A lot of girls came by.

36:09.071 --> 36:10.111
We're quite popular.

36:10.271 --> 36:11.311
What did Jacs want?

36:12.271 --> 36:13.671
What did you say when he proposed?

36:16.351 --> 36:17.511
Did you cry?

36:17.671 --> 36:19.271
What did she want, Franky?

36:20.311 --> 36:21.551
Have you set a date?

36:21.631 --> 36:23.031
This is not about me.

36:25.711 --> 36:27.151
It's not about me either.

36:37.031 --> 36:38.951
Do you think Jacs will ever give up?

36:39.831 --> 36:41.351
She'll die trying.

36:41.991 --> 36:43.311
If that's what you want.

36:44.591 --> 36:46.271
I never said otherwise, Red!

36:52.991 --> 36:55.311
I'm wondering what happens when
someone else comes up against you.

37:02.671 --> 37:03.911
You putting your hand up, are you?

37:05.031 --> 37:06.031
No.

37:06.111 --> 37:07.151
Didn't think so.

37:11.751 --> 37:12.831
We've, uh...

37:13.191 --> 37:14.431
We've been through a lot.

37:15.871 --> 37:17.631
No one's ever done
something like that for me.

37:20.311 --> 37:21.631
It's not something I'll forget.

37:45.431 --> 37:46.631
You look like shit.

37:48.471 --> 37:49.951
So I've heard.

37:51.031 --> 37:52.351
Too busy with Debbie to visit?

37:52.431 --> 37:53.551
You wanted me to get with her!

37:53.951 --> 37:55.791
Hasn't been difficult for you, has it?

37:56.551 --> 37:57.551
No.

37:57.631 --> 38:01.271
I wanna talk to you about the business.
You, what it means to be a Holt.

38:01.351 --> 38:02.991
I know what it means to be a Holt.

38:03.711 --> 38:04.871
You made sure of that.

38:05.191 --> 38:06.191
When?

38:06.431 --> 38:07.711
Brayden's birthday.

38:08.511 --> 38:10.511
That's the memory you want to leave my son?

38:21.791 --> 38:25.031
I've done my best to
prepare you and protect you.

38:25.431 --> 38:26.511
Not always.

38:34.351 --> 38:35.511
Mum?

38:38.351 --> 38:40.031
I did what I did for your father.

38:41.231 --> 38:43.391
And now he wants a divorce
so he can marry that slut.

38:43.951 --> 38:45.071
You know what that means?

38:45.471 --> 38:48.231
I have no influence on the
outside, no power in here.

38:48.711 --> 38:51.151
The women will turn on me. Your
father's made sure about that.

38:53.391 --> 38:55.071
You're all I've got now.

39:04.671 --> 39:05.991
It's time.

39:15.671 --> 39:17.391
Time to break up with Debbie.

39:25.791 --> 39:27.391
Where did you really
think this was heading?

39:27.471 --> 39:28.551
You know how we work.

39:28.951 --> 39:32.551
Brayden! I'm sorry you had
to see that, son. Look at me.

39:34.191 --> 39:35.551
I know you're scared.

39:38.231 --> 39:41.151
You're the only one I've
got who can keep me safe.

39:42.191 --> 39:45.151
But, Brayden, this is what
we do to protect what we have.

39:47.951 --> 39:49.431
Time to step up.

39:52.591 --> 39:55.831
And I'd do it again for you.
Your father and our business.

39:56.791 --> 39:58.031
One day you'll understand that.

40:01.591 --> 40:02.791
Time's up.

40:07.111 --> 40:08.511
If I do this for you...

40:13.991 --> 40:15.271
Then we're done.

40:18.231 --> 40:19.471
You'll be back.

40:25.351 --> 40:26.511
No, I won't.
