WEBVTT

01:01.792 --> 01:04.792
Flat white to go
for Maury.

01:04.792 --> 01:07.000
Maury?

01:07.000 --> 01:10.083
Maura?

01:10.083 --> 01:11.458
Mary?

01:11.458 --> 01:13.750
- I made that one already.
- Oh, who's this for?

01:13.750 --> 01:15.542
Alexander.
But keep up the good work.

01:15.542 --> 01:18.000
- Okay.
- So what'd you want
to talk about?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.708
I think it's maybe better
if we do that in your office.

01:20.708 --> 01:25.417
Oh. I'm so sorry
you won't be gracing us
with your presence anymore.

01:25.417 --> 01:26.917
And I'll see you
in about a week

01:26.917 --> 01:29.333
when you quit
whatever bullshit gig
you're leaving for

01:29.333 --> 01:31.375
and come back here begging
for your old job again.

01:31.375 --> 01:35.417
Ray, I know that
it must hurt to see
someone leave all of this,

01:35.417 --> 01:38.500
but it's really not
a bullshit job, so...

01:40.291 --> 01:42.959
- What is it?
- What?

01:42.959 --> 01:44.959
The bullshit gig,
what is it?

01:44.959 --> 01:46.458
"GQ" magazine.

01:46.458 --> 01:49.542
Did they need someone
for a before picture in
a makeover article?

01:49.542 --> 01:51.000
No, it's a writing job.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.333
They saw one
of my pieces online

01:52.333 --> 01:54.375
and I'm going to be working
for a new section--

01:54.375 --> 01:56.708
"Field Guide
to the Urban Man."

01:56.708 --> 01:58.250
Who's the sponsor?

01:58.250 --> 02:00.208
What do you mean?

02:00.208 --> 02:02.375
There's no way
"GQ" hires you
to be a staff writer.

02:02.375 --> 02:04.333
So it's obviously one
of those advertorial sections

02:04.333 --> 02:07.542
where it looks like
a real article so they
trick you into reading it,

02:07.542 --> 02:09.333
but then you find out
it's a paid advertisement

02:09.333 --> 02:11.375
which is both morally
and creatively bankrupt.

02:11.375 --> 02:13.708
So who's the sponsor?

02:15.542 --> 02:16.708
Neiman Marcus.

02:16.708 --> 02:18.542
( laughs )
Neiman Marcus?

02:18.542 --> 02:20.875
Do you think
I'm fucking excited, Ray?

02:20.875 --> 02:23.458
Do you think that I think
this is the best use

02:23.458 --> 02:27.417
of my literary voice
and my myriad talents?

02:27.417 --> 02:29.875
Maybe we should talk
about this back in my office.

02:29.875 --> 02:31.208
- No.
- Excuse me.

02:31.208 --> 02:33.667
I already quit.
There's no reason for me
to go to your office.

02:33.667 --> 02:36.708
Stop making a scene
in front of the customers.

02:36.708 --> 02:40.000
I am coming with you
as a gesture of friendship.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Though I am not your employee,
so I don't technically have to.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.959
Ray:
Right now!

02:48.834 --> 02:52.959
( music playing )

02:56.542 --> 02:58.166
Ray:
Set the pick!

02:58.166 --> 03:00.125
Up high. Rotate.

03:00.125 --> 03:02.125
Isolate. Clear out.

03:03.291 --> 03:05.000
- I got you.
- Put it up.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.500
- ( cheers )
- Ray: Here, and one.

03:09.417 --> 03:11.333
Nice job.

03:22.125 --> 03:25.083
( phones ringing )

03:30.917 --> 03:33.625
( rings )

03:33.625 --> 03:36.583
- Hannah Horvath's office.
- Mike Lawson, please.

03:36.583 --> 03:39.583
Okay, I'm new here,
so maybe you just...

03:39.583 --> 03:41.458
( hangs up )

03:41.458 --> 03:43.208
Okay.

03:48.458 --> 03:51.834
It's a cappuccino, Dean.
It's not a cup of chino.

03:51.834 --> 03:54.375
Okay?
Fucking animals.

04:11.750 --> 04:13.250
Ahem.

04:13.250 --> 04:14.625
Hello?

04:14.625 --> 04:17.125
Ray:
Yes, hi, I'm trying to reach
Marnie Michaels, please.

04:17.125 --> 04:18.959
This is she.
May I ask who's calling?

04:18.959 --> 04:22.458
- It's Ray.
- I didn't recognize
your voice.

04:22.458 --> 04:24.000
Did you not recognize
my voice?

04:24.000 --> 04:27.708
No, I did.
I'm calling you,
so I already know--

04:27.708 --> 04:30.500
you know, I was just going
for a little joke there.
What's up?

04:30.500 --> 04:32.792
- How can I help you?
- Right.

04:32.792 --> 04:34.625
As to the matter at hand.

04:34.625 --> 04:36.667
I don't know if there
is a matter at hand.

04:36.667 --> 04:38.875
I was just calling
just to check in
with you, really,

04:38.875 --> 04:40.834
and just to say that I--

04:40.834 --> 04:43.834
I enjoyed spending time
with you the other day.

04:43.834 --> 04:46.083
Yeah, that was--

04:46.083 --> 04:48.041
that was definitely
unexpected.

04:48.041 --> 04:50.792
Indeed, yes.
Most unexpected indeed.

04:50.792 --> 04:52.959
So, anyway, yeah,
I just wanted to
check in and--

04:52.959 --> 04:55.041
Could you stop
saying "checking in"?
It's fucking weird.

04:55.041 --> 04:57.542
It's a fucking thing
people say, okay?

04:57.542 --> 05:00.542
Relax.
I'm using semantic convention
to sound accessible.

05:00.542 --> 05:03.125
- Oh, my God.
- Anyway, I'm calling you

05:03.125 --> 05:06.875
just to say, you know,
let's not let all this
affect our friendship.

05:06.875 --> 05:08.000
But we're not even friends.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.500
Then so let's not let it
affect that either.

05:10.500 --> 05:11.875
Okay, will do.

05:11.875 --> 05:14.208
Look, I'm trying
here, okay?

05:14.208 --> 05:16.708
I'm trying to follow
the protocols of a gentleman
and a squire.

05:16.708 --> 05:18.458
- But if you keep--
- Okay, thank you.

05:18.458 --> 05:20.083
And if you'll excuse me,
I'm just in the middle

05:20.083 --> 05:22.625
of watching
a pretty interesting
television program, so...

05:22.625 --> 05:24.750
- Yeah? Which one?
- Do you care?

05:24.750 --> 05:27.917
- Not at all.
- Okay, bye-bye.

05:44.917 --> 05:47.625
( rings )

05:48.959 --> 05:49.917
What?

05:49.917 --> 05:51.875
- I do care.
- About what?

05:51.875 --> 05:55.125
About which shitty
television program
you're watching.

05:55.125 --> 05:57.458
- I care.
- Prove it.

05:59.208 --> 06:00.917
Marnie?

06:05.333 --> 06:07.166
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:12.583 --> 06:15.583
- What's up?
- Nothing much.

06:19.125 --> 06:21.250
Yo.

06:21.250 --> 06:23.458
Can I help you
with something?

06:23.458 --> 06:25.458
Sorry, I was just
screwing with you.
Sorry.

06:25.458 --> 06:26.959
- Hey, I'm Joe.
- Hannah.

06:26.959 --> 06:29.667
- Nice to meet you.
- I know. I know all
about you.

06:29.667 --> 06:32.083
I read your piece
about...

06:32.083 --> 06:33.792
( whispers )
cocaine

06:33.792 --> 06:35.291
on JazzHate.com.
It was very funny.

06:35.291 --> 06:37.875
Yeah, I feel like
that wasn't as retweeted
as it should have been.

06:37.875 --> 06:40.500
- So I appreciate the support.
- No, I'm not on Twitter.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.291
- But I'll Instagram it
later if you want.
- ( laughs )

06:43.291 --> 06:45.041
I don't think
that even makes sense.

06:45.041 --> 06:47.291
- So...
- No, it doesn't.

06:47.291 --> 06:51.000
I bet you're probably
wondering right now,
"Where do I go to pee?"

06:51.000 --> 06:53.250
I'm really wondering that.

06:53.250 --> 06:55.583
Yeah, no one tells anyone
anything around here.

06:55.583 --> 06:58.959
They just assume you have
corporate sonar.

06:58.959 --> 07:00.583
Yeah, but I wouldn't
call this a corporate job.

07:00.583 --> 07:03.041
I mean, this is "GQ" magazine.
It's a literary institution.

07:03.041 --> 07:04.667
Shh, careful.

07:04.667 --> 07:08.083
You don't want
the real "GQ" writers hearing
you say you work at "GQ."

07:08.083 --> 07:10.291
- Wait, why?
- They're really
fucking snobby

07:10.291 --> 07:13.000
about the difference between
editorial and advertorial.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.583
I don't know if you
heard about that.

07:14.583 --> 07:17.500
Which is such fucking
bullshit because we all work
at the same magazine.

07:17.500 --> 07:22.166
You know? We're all here
just selling our souls.

07:23.291 --> 07:25.625
Totally won't
say it again.

07:25.625 --> 07:29.083
Anyway,
enough blabbering.

07:29.083 --> 07:31.333
Why don't I give you
a quick tour?

07:31.333 --> 07:32.917
Okay. Great.

07:32.917 --> 07:35.000
The women's room
is back this way.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.708
Unless you want to see
the snack room first.

07:39.291 --> 07:42.917
You just said snack room
and everything blurred.

07:42.917 --> 07:45.041
( chuckles )

07:45.041 --> 07:47.417
And then there's donuts

07:47.417 --> 07:49.041
and finger sandwiches
in the afternoon.

07:49.041 --> 07:51.208
- Finger sandwiches? Cool.
- Finger sandwiches.

07:51.208 --> 07:53.959
- So help yourself.
- Oh, I don't know.

07:53.959 --> 07:55.500
Maybe later.
I'm on kind of a budget.
I don't know.

07:55.500 --> 07:58.959
Is it like-- do you swipe
your employee ID or is it
an honor system?

07:58.959 --> 08:01.583
What?
No, it's all free.

08:02.667 --> 08:04.417
- It's free?
- It's all free.

08:04.417 --> 08:07.375
- You're saying
all this is free?
- Yeah.

08:07.375 --> 08:09.291
- Even the Sun Chips?
- Yeah.

08:09.291 --> 08:11.041
- Even the Clif Bars?
- Yeah.

08:11.041 --> 08:15.125
Even the lox,
which is disgusting,
but very expensive?

08:15.125 --> 08:17.875
It's actually
Russ & Daughters.
It's pretty good.

08:17.875 --> 08:19.959
Oh, my God.

08:21.375 --> 08:25.083
Mm, it's 11:45.
We got to go.

08:25.083 --> 08:27.667
Just give me one moment
to catch up with you.

08:30.458 --> 08:33.457
Guys, this is Hannah.
Han--

08:33.457 --> 08:35.457
Hannah?

08:36.582 --> 08:38.207
- Hi.
- Hey.

08:38.207 --> 08:39.500
I'm Hannah

08:39.500 --> 08:42.625
and I feel I may
have overdone it
on the snacks a little bit.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.166
No, I said I needed
a christening dress.

08:52.166 --> 08:53.417
So what's the problem?

08:53.417 --> 08:56.667
Christening dresses
are usually white,
aren't they?

08:56.667 --> 08:57.917
Not the chic ones.

08:57.917 --> 09:00.917
And also, isn't that small
for a one-year-old?

09:00.917 --> 09:03.291
No, unless your child
is morbidly obese,

09:03.291 --> 09:04.625
in which case
I can't help you.

09:04.625 --> 09:06.875
- All right, I'll take it.
- Fabulous.

09:10.458 --> 09:11.875
Anyways,
as I was saying,

09:11.875 --> 09:14.500
Ray really seems to have
the respect of his peers
on the court.

09:14.500 --> 09:18.208
Oh, that's amazing.
It's really hard for a Jew
to gain respect in sports.

09:18.208 --> 09:20.959
Mm-hmm.
He's not a Jew, though.

09:21.959 --> 09:23.291
Right.

09:23.291 --> 09:24.792
So his new coffee place

09:24.792 --> 09:27.125
is such a refreshing
departure from the average
java house grind.

09:27.125 --> 09:28.708
- I've never been there.
- No, me neither.

09:28.708 --> 09:31.333
That's just what
"Time Out New York" said.

09:31.333 --> 09:34.125
"Despite the unfortunate
familiarity of its name,

09:34.125 --> 09:36.959
Ray's is a refreshing
departure from the average
java house grind."

09:36.959 --> 09:40.750
Ray is being written about in
popular service publications
and my life is a mess.

09:40.750 --> 09:42.208
And I know that
that was a personal choice,

09:42.208 --> 09:44.625
but I feel like
maybe it is time for me
to unchoose that choice.

09:44.625 --> 09:45.875
Like, step one:
I need to be

09:45.875 --> 09:47.834
in a solid, mature,
committed relationship

09:47.834 --> 09:50.000
with someone who understands
my goals and values.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.417
Like Berren.

09:51.417 --> 09:53.000
Is that the guy
with the deep V?

09:53.000 --> 09:56.041
You're right.
Parker's a much
better choice.

09:57.667 --> 09:59.208
He's just so stupid

09:59.208 --> 10:03.667
that I worry that our children
wouldn't get into preschool.

10:03.667 --> 10:05.708
See, I live with
my boyfriend in Brooklyn.

10:05.708 --> 10:07.625
Oh, nice.
You're shacking up.

10:07.625 --> 10:09.500
- I guess so.
- What does he do?

10:09.500 --> 10:11.083
Like, a little bit of this
and a little bit of that.

10:11.083 --> 10:13.500
Karen's boyfriend
is actually in a very
similar field.

10:13.500 --> 10:14.667
He was in a very
similar field.

10:14.667 --> 10:17.834
Wait, so it's officially
over between you and Jake

10:17.834 --> 10:20.333
or he just finally
got a real job?

10:20.333 --> 10:23.000
- It's like
a little bit of both.
- Right, right.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.500
- But which one?
- Hi, everyone.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.875
- Hello.
- I see you've met Hannah.

10:27.875 --> 10:30.417
- Hannah,
you've met the team?
- Yep.

10:30.417 --> 10:32.583
And I see you found
the snack room as well.

10:32.583 --> 10:34.875
Oh, yeah.
These are not
just for me.

10:34.875 --> 10:38.041
Great. All right.
So reiterating once again,

10:38.041 --> 10:39.500
"The Field Guide
for the Urban Male."

10:39.500 --> 10:41.208
- We need eight types.
- Mm-hmm.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.750
Something like you'd find
in a bird watcher's manual,
but funny.

10:43.750 --> 10:47.458
Not corny funny, smart.
Client doesn't want a bunch
of sarcastic bullshit.

10:47.458 --> 10:49.667
I also want you to be thinking
about the corresponding looks

10:49.667 --> 10:51.291
that Neiman Marcus
could roll out

10:51.291 --> 10:52.750
to store windows
and catalogues.

10:52.750 --> 10:55.583
So far we have
the Millennial Man's Man,

10:55.583 --> 10:58.125
Mr. Midnight,
and the Gowanus Yachtsman.

10:58.125 --> 11:01.708
So let's hear what else
you guys have.

11:02.750 --> 11:04.041
Hannah.

11:04.041 --> 11:05.875
Okay, I haven't come up
with a name for this yet,

11:05.875 --> 11:08.542
but it's like he's a dad,
but he's not trying to be
the coolest dad.

11:08.542 --> 11:11.959
But he's also embracing
vintage Bill Cosbyish dadness,

11:11.959 --> 11:14.166
so that actually inherently
makes him cool.

11:14.166 --> 11:16.375
- And what would you call it?
- Classic Dad?

11:16.375 --> 11:18.834
- Or Dad Classic.
- That's good.

11:18.834 --> 11:20.875
Or, if you want
to be a little sassy,

11:20.875 --> 11:24.000
Kewl Dad,
cool spelled K-E-W-L.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.250
- Kewl Dad?
- Kewl Dad.

11:25.250 --> 11:28.667
Yeah, that's a type
worth considering.
Anyone else?

11:29.542 --> 11:32.417
I have another.
The Kaballer.

11:32.417 --> 11:33.834
He is a little sleazy.

11:33.834 --> 11:35.583
You know, he's out
looking for sex,

11:35.583 --> 11:37.834
but he's wearing
a kabbalah bracelet
so you know he's spiritual

11:37.834 --> 11:40.125
and he'd, like,
fuck some serious
enlightenment into you.

11:40.125 --> 11:42.583
Oh, no, big-time.
He's got, like,
drawstring yoga pants,

11:42.583 --> 11:45.750
- widow's peak
like Justin Theroux.
- 100%.

11:45.750 --> 11:47.875
Neiman Marcus doesn't sell
a widow's peak,

11:47.875 --> 11:50.542
but worth considering.
I'll write that down.

11:50.542 --> 11:52.291
Anyone else?

11:53.166 --> 11:54.834
The Mod Hatter.

11:57.792 --> 12:01.667
So like a snappy dresser
in an understated hat?

12:01.667 --> 12:03.708
Sort of.

12:03.708 --> 12:06.041
Okay, I think we have to
make sure that it's not like

12:06.041 --> 12:08.834
a "Hey, look at me.
I'm wearing a fedora
or a pork pie hat."

12:08.834 --> 12:11.959
- Yeah, fedoras
are worse than genocide.
- The worst.

12:11.959 --> 12:14.000
No, I mean Mod Hatter

12:14.000 --> 12:16.083
as in one of those guys
you see walking down
the street--

12:16.083 --> 12:18.208
Kevin, you know, I actually
don't think that's a type.

12:18.208 --> 12:19.959
I think that's just
some guy you saw.

12:19.959 --> 12:22.875
- Thank you, Kevin.
- You're welcome.

12:24.625 --> 12:26.375
Anyone else?

12:27.792 --> 12:29.291
I have a couple more.

12:29.291 --> 12:31.375
Has anyone ever, like,
gotten in trouble

12:31.375 --> 12:33.000
for overdoing it
with the snacks?

12:33.000 --> 12:34.333
Has anyone ever
been spoken to?

12:34.333 --> 12:36.041
Girl, I gained, like,
14 pounds my first week here.

12:36.041 --> 12:37.959
I never want to see
another Sun Chip again.

12:37.959 --> 12:40.458
( laughs )
See you soon.

12:40.458 --> 12:42.917
( phone rings )

12:42.917 --> 12:44.333
Hannah Horvath's office.

12:44.333 --> 12:45.875
Hey, yo, it's Joe.

12:45.875 --> 12:47.625
- Hi.
- I believe we've met.
Remember me?

12:47.625 --> 12:49.834
- Mm-hmm.
- Look to your left.

12:49.834 --> 12:51.500
Other left.

12:52.583 --> 12:54.083
- Hello.
- Hey.

12:54.083 --> 12:55.792
Okay, Kevin hates me.

12:55.792 --> 12:59.583
I mean, I'm used to people
being belittled by my rapid-fire
mind pace, but this is--

12:59.583 --> 13:02.166
- Did Karen say anything?
- About what?

13:02.166 --> 13:03.792
About me.

13:03.792 --> 13:06.208
No, why?
Are you, like,
into Karen or something?

13:06.208 --> 13:08.750
Shh! No.
I mean, maybe.

13:08.750 --> 13:12.291
I don't know.
Why, did she say that
she thinks I'm into her?

13:12.291 --> 13:14.583
We really did not
discuss it.

13:14.583 --> 13:16.208
Yeah, that sounds like Karen.

13:16.208 --> 13:21.166
She's so taciturn
and guarded and complicated.

13:21.166 --> 13:22.917
Well, have you ever
asked her out?

13:22.917 --> 13:25.959
Yes, once.
Almost.

13:25.959 --> 13:28.875
Don't tell her that
I told you that I almost
asked her out once.

13:28.875 --> 13:32.041
- I'm not telling
Karen anything.
- Good.

13:32.041 --> 13:33.917
You're a total psycho.

13:33.917 --> 13:35.667
Okay, thanks.

13:35.667 --> 13:37.500
Anyway-- shit,
I've got to go.

13:37.500 --> 13:40.542
- Okay.
- Lose my number.

13:44.708 --> 13:46.417
Man on computer:
Up next...

13:46.417 --> 13:49.792
- Woman on computer: This psycho
bitch wants to tell me...
- ( knocking on door )

13:53.208 --> 13:55.083
- Hey.
- Yo.

13:55.083 --> 13:57.500
Could you take
your shoes off, please?

13:57.500 --> 14:01.291
Yeah, wouldn't want
to scuff this pristine
linoleum you got here.

14:02.333 --> 14:04.625
I brought you
some vegan muffins.

14:04.625 --> 14:07.000
Wow, muffins from
the place you run.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.458
What an extravagant gesture.

14:08.458 --> 14:10.333
Yeah, would have brought
you some scones,

14:10.333 --> 14:12.041
but we're running
a little low.

14:12.041 --> 14:15.333
So, ready to watch
some shitty TV?

14:15.333 --> 14:17.333
No one asked you
to come here.

14:18.708 --> 14:21.000
Look, I know you're going
through a hard time lately.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.917
Okay? And I also know
that's the last thing
you'd ever admit to anyone.

14:24.917 --> 14:27.208
Okay? So why don't we
just sit down together

14:27.208 --> 14:30.083
like not friends
and you could
introduce me

14:30.083 --> 14:32.750
to your televiewing
sensibilities.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.208
Well, have you ever seen
reality television before?

14:39.208 --> 14:42.333
I've seen Ken Burns's
jazz documentary
about 17 times.

14:42.333 --> 14:44.417
- Does that count?
- Absolutely not.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.959
No way.
No, it doesn't.

14:46.959 --> 14:48.458
Um, okay, let's see.

14:48.458 --> 14:52.417
Which "Real Housewives" locale
is the most intriguing to you?

14:52.417 --> 14:54.291
The one set in Prague.

14:54.291 --> 14:56.875
- Beverly Hills?
- Sure.

14:56.875 --> 14:58.834
Okay.

14:58.834 --> 15:01.708
Woman:
I paid Shana
$400,000...

15:05.458 --> 15:08.750
- ( Adam grunting )
- Hi.

15:08.750 --> 15:10.625
Hi.

15:10.625 --> 15:12.417
Hi, my love.

15:12.417 --> 15:15.375
Oh, you are
so excited to see me.

15:16.667 --> 15:18.834
- How was it?
- It was amazing.

15:18.834 --> 15:20.375
I mean,
I was nervous at first,

15:20.375 --> 15:22.208
but then they were like,
"Tell us your ideas."

15:22.208 --> 15:25.458
And I told them my ideas
and they all said,
"Great ideas."

15:25.458 --> 15:27.917
- Yeah.
- And then...

15:31.000 --> 15:32.667
This is all free.

15:32.667 --> 15:34.208
It's all shit.

15:34.208 --> 15:35.667
It's all full
of chemicals

15:35.667 --> 15:38.417
and fake salt
and pigeon bones.

15:38.417 --> 15:40.250
This is just beef.

15:40.250 --> 15:41.792
( clatters )

15:41.792 --> 15:44.708
Well, anyway,
I didn't pay for
any of it, so...

15:44.708 --> 15:45.875
How was your day?

15:45.875 --> 15:49.166
Had another
fucking audition.

15:49.166 --> 15:51.166
That's great!
How was it?

15:51.166 --> 15:55.542
Well, I walk in and they
have the videotape camera.

15:55.542 --> 15:58.083
And the casting woman
was like, "Look into
the camera.

15:58.083 --> 15:59.917
Give us a smile
and say your name."

15:59.917 --> 16:02.917
These fucking people.
And so I looked in
the camera and I said,

16:02.917 --> 16:05.542
"Hi, my name is
Adam Sackler and I don't
smile on command."

16:05.542 --> 16:07.333
And she was like,
"It's called fucking acting."

16:07.333 --> 16:09.208
I was like,
"No, it's called
fucking see ya

16:09.208 --> 16:11.125
'cause I'm fucking
out of here."

16:11.125 --> 16:13.458
What a total bitch.

16:14.875 --> 16:18.041
But, you know,
if you really want
to get an acting job--

16:18.041 --> 16:20.500
I don't want to get
an actual job.

16:20.500 --> 16:23.291
Then why are you
going on auditions?

16:23.291 --> 16:24.417
The challenge.

16:24.417 --> 16:28.792
I just like
reading emotional
cues from strangers

16:28.792 --> 16:30.542
in a high-pressure
situation.

16:30.542 --> 16:33.458
Oh, yeah,
that definitely
makes sense.

16:33.458 --> 16:35.834
But you know what else
would be a cool,
fun challenge?

16:35.834 --> 16:38.083
Would be, like,
actually getting a job.

16:38.083 --> 16:40.083
And then we'd be able
to pay all of our rent

16:40.083 --> 16:41.500
and we'd never
have to worry.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.458
I could sell these on Etsy
for, like, 20 bucks each.

16:43.458 --> 16:45.792
People are fucking stupid.

16:51.667 --> 16:53.417
- Marnie.
- Shh, shh.

16:53.417 --> 16:55.792
Marnie, sorry to interrupt.
I think I slipped out.

16:55.792 --> 16:58.917
- Okay. Okay. Yes.
- Would you mind putting
it back in?

16:58.917 --> 17:01.750
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay, yeah.

17:01.750 --> 17:03.667
- Okay.
- That's much better.

17:03.667 --> 17:05.834
- Thank you.
- Okay, you're welcome.

17:10.290 --> 17:11.583
Hey, Kevin.

17:11.583 --> 17:13.916
I'm really sorry
if I upset you during
the meeting yesterday.

17:13.916 --> 17:15.000
You really didn't.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.040
Well, you rolled
your eyes at me, so...

17:17.040 --> 17:18.959
I really didn't.

17:18.959 --> 17:21.416
Come on, dude.
What's your problem?

17:21.416 --> 17:24.040
I just don't like you.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.290
Oh, come on.
Who even says that?

17:26.290 --> 17:28.792
It's 'cause I had, like,
one better idea than you?

17:28.792 --> 17:32.458
No, it's because
I don't like your face.

17:33.917 --> 17:35.291
Wait, my face?

17:35.291 --> 17:37.458
You're not ugly.
I am not saying that.

17:37.458 --> 17:39.500
I'm just not into it.
It annoys me.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.458
Your mouth--

17:41.458 --> 17:43.625
it makes me want
to rip it off your face.

17:43.625 --> 17:47.000
You look like someone
I dated who I hated even
while I was dating them.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.125
Man or a woman?

17:48.125 --> 17:51.125
- Oh, come on.
- I wasn't trying
to be a jerk.

17:51.125 --> 17:53.333
I want to know if you think
I look like a woman or a man.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.625
- Great.
- Kevin, I don't
want to fight.

17:55.625 --> 17:57.000
Come on, what can I do?

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
I don't know,
get a new face?

18:00.000 --> 18:01.875
Everyone knows
I'm the Sun Chip guy here.

18:01.875 --> 18:03.542
You know what?
I'm gonna say this

18:03.542 --> 18:05.250
because nobody else
around here will say it,

18:05.250 --> 18:07.667
but you're doing
a dope job.

18:07.667 --> 18:09.667
Oh, thank you so much.

18:09.667 --> 18:11.208
Yeah, dope
by Janice's standards.

18:11.208 --> 18:13.625
- Word.
- You're really gonna make
a name for yourself.

18:13.625 --> 18:17.542
Thank you so much,
but I'm not really trying
to make a name for myself.

18:17.542 --> 18:19.500
I mean, I just kind of want
to get in, get out.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.375
I'm not looking
to take Janice's job.

18:21.375 --> 18:22.834
Why not?

18:22.834 --> 18:24.500
'Cause I'm a writer.

18:24.500 --> 18:25.750
Yeah, we're all writers.

18:25.750 --> 18:27.959
Yeah, but I'm like, no offense,
just a writer writer.

18:27.959 --> 18:31.500
Not like a corporate
advertising, working-for-
the-man kind of writer.

18:31.500 --> 18:34.417
Who is?
Kevin over here
won a Yale Series

18:34.417 --> 18:36.333
of Younger Poets
award back in 2009.

18:36.333 --> 18:38.708
- Karen: Mm-hmm.
- You're a poet?

18:38.708 --> 18:40.166
I dabble
in the dark arts.

18:40.166 --> 18:43.375
And Karen has had
some great pieces in "n+1."

18:43.375 --> 18:45.000
It was a while ago,
but, yeah.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
It's like an unpacking
of the "Jersey Shore"
through an imperialist lens.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.875
- Joe: That was such
a totally great piece.
- Karen: No, it's not.

18:51.875 --> 18:54.083
Are any of you jerks
gonna say my thing, or do
I have to say it myself?

18:54.083 --> 18:55.417
Joe had a talk piece
in the "New Yorker."

18:55.417 --> 18:56.959
He wasn't even a year
out of college.

18:56.959 --> 18:59.667
Joe:
Which is how I got
this job, by the way.

18:59.667 --> 19:01.417
And thank God I did
'cause I was, like,

19:01.417 --> 19:04.375
right on the verge
of packing it in and
moving back to Arizona.

19:04.375 --> 19:06.750
Kevin: Me, too.
Not Arizona, but...

19:06.750 --> 19:09.708
No health insurance,
no dental, no corporate
gym membership.

19:09.708 --> 19:12.792
But you all still write,
like, your own pieces
and stuff, right?

19:12.792 --> 19:14.542
Like your own spiritually
fulfilling work?

19:14.542 --> 19:16.458
Kevin:
I don't know about that,
but we write.

19:16.458 --> 19:19.166
Yeah, of course.
Sometimes.

19:19.166 --> 19:20.708
Yeah, I'm thinking about
some ideas for things.

19:20.708 --> 19:24.250
I'm gonna dive back in
as soon as I figure out
my next move.

19:25.041 --> 19:26.625
How long you all been here?

19:26.625 --> 19:28.083
- Five years.
- Three years.

19:28.083 --> 19:30.083
Forever.

19:35.083 --> 19:37.750
I'm so sorry.
I just need one minute.

19:47.708 --> 19:50.417
( breathing heavily )

19:53.417 --> 19:55.375
I don't regret a single
moment of my wild months,

19:55.375 --> 19:57.792
but those oats have been
sowed and now it's time
to get back to reality.

19:57.792 --> 20:01.083
- Totally.
- But, I mean, I have
a history, Parker.

20:01.083 --> 20:03.125
I have been there
and I have done that.

20:03.125 --> 20:05.583
I'm very je ne regrette
rieny about it,

20:05.583 --> 20:08.083
but is that something that
you think you can handle?

20:08.083 --> 20:10.458
Caitlyn told me
that you told her

20:10.458 --> 20:14.083
that I was literally
the dumbest person
you had ever met.

20:14.083 --> 20:16.750
Um, that's just weird.

20:16.750 --> 20:19.041
And she said that

20:19.041 --> 20:22.542
I coul--
I couldn't find
the library,

20:22.542 --> 20:25.708
which is now
obviously not true.

20:26.583 --> 20:28.458
Okay, you're getting
off topic.

20:28.458 --> 20:30.250
Also, does that sound like
something that I would say?

20:30.250 --> 20:32.542
No. That sounds like one
of Caitlyn's stupid jokes

20:32.542 --> 20:33.917
because she thinks
she's so provocative.

20:33.917 --> 20:36.041
- Okay.
- But if you don't
think you're ready

20:36.041 --> 20:38.291
for a serious
girlfriend-boyfriend
relationship, tell me now

20:38.291 --> 20:40.792
because I do not
have any more time
to waste on frivolities.

20:40.792 --> 20:44.500
I'm down for whatever.

20:44.500 --> 20:47.208
I totally think you can
tie your shoes, by the way.

20:49.125 --> 20:51.375
( knocks )

20:51.375 --> 20:53.166
Hey, Janice,
do you have a minute?

20:53.166 --> 20:55.583
Sure, Hannah.
Come on in. Have a seat.

20:55.583 --> 20:57.333
Thank you.

20:57.333 --> 21:00.125
You know, you've been
doing a great job.

21:00.125 --> 21:01.375
Oh, thank you.

21:01.375 --> 21:03.708
You remind me a lot
of myself 10 years ago.

21:03.708 --> 21:05.667
Uh, thank you.
Speaking of which,

21:05.667 --> 21:08.333
I don't want to be here
in 10 years.

21:08.333 --> 21:10.166
- Why not?
- I don't know.

21:10.166 --> 21:13.000
I'm just realizing
how easy it is to get
seduced by the perks

21:13.000 --> 21:14.500
and the money
and the free snacks.

21:14.500 --> 21:16.291
And then suddenly
I wake up in 10 years

21:16.291 --> 21:19.750
and I'm not a writer anymore,
I'm a former writer who works
in corporate advertising.

21:19.750 --> 21:21.708
And that is not my plan.

21:21.708 --> 21:23.625
All right, Hannah.
There's a lot of
other people

21:23.625 --> 21:25.959
who would love
to have your job.

21:25.959 --> 21:28.250
That's it?

21:28.250 --> 21:30.542
That's it.

21:49.291 --> 21:51.667
Hey, Janice.
You know, I actually
thought about it

21:51.667 --> 21:55.208
and I have decided to stay
if my position is still open.

21:55.208 --> 21:56.375
I'm putting copper pipes
in my house.

21:56.375 --> 21:57.792
I really can't deal
with this right now.

21:57.792 --> 22:00.208
You want to just e-mail me
and let me know if you
still work here?

22:01.417 --> 22:03.041
Aren't you supposed
to work today?

22:03.041 --> 22:04.708
No, I texted Keith
and told him to open.

22:04.708 --> 22:06.041
- Oh.
- He's a good man.

22:06.041 --> 22:08.291
Yeah. I keep meaning
to come down and--

22:08.291 --> 22:11.041
oh, shit.

22:20.083 --> 22:21.250
Fucking doppelgangers.

22:21.250 --> 22:23.083
Yeah, and they look just like
Hannah and Adam, too.

22:23.083 --> 22:25.208
Yeah, that's what
doppelgangers means.

22:25.208 --> 22:27.792
- No doy, Ray.
- Oh, good one, Michaels.

22:27.792 --> 22:31.166
Thank you.
I know what
doppelganger means.

22:31.166 --> 22:34.208
So wait, Hannah told me
that you were fund raising

22:34.208 --> 22:35.708
for inner-city schools
or something?

22:35.708 --> 22:37.250
- Is that right?
- No, no, it's not right.

22:37.250 --> 22:38.959
That's classic
Hannah hyperbole.

22:38.959 --> 22:41.875
All I did was put a jar by
the register so people can make
donations if they wanted to.

22:41.875 --> 22:44.083
- Oh, that's like...
- Yeah, that's nothing.

22:44.083 --> 22:46.083
I'm not like George Soros
or something.

22:46.083 --> 22:47.542
Yeah, no.
Not at all.

22:47.542 --> 22:49.250
One of my biggest regrets
is that I didn't spend

22:49.250 --> 22:52.125
a semester abroad
in Africa, you know,

22:52.125 --> 22:55.125
doing volunteer work
and stuff like that.

22:55.125 --> 22:56.542
Well, you know,
maybe that's for the best.

22:56.542 --> 22:58.291
- What do you mean?
- Well, you know, I mean,

22:58.291 --> 23:00.208
I think it's pretty clear
by now that Western aid

23:00.208 --> 23:02.083
has been shown to be
the very thing

23:02.083 --> 23:04.250
keeping Africa
so impoverished
and underdeveloped.

23:04.250 --> 23:07.417
Maybe it's a good thing.
Teach a man to fish
and all that.

23:07.417 --> 23:09.417
That's a little bit
racist, Ray.

23:09.417 --> 23:11.458
That's not even
a little bit racist.

23:11.458 --> 23:13.625
That's not even
remotely racist, okay?

23:13.625 --> 23:16.125
That's a rigorous truth
about a very flawed policy.

23:16.125 --> 23:17.750
And it's a little bit
fucking racist.

23:17.750 --> 23:19.708
- Okay, let's skip it.
- Dude, what's your
fucking problem?

23:19.708 --> 23:21.000
- What is my problem?
- Yeah.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.583
My problem is
I don't understand

23:22.583 --> 23:24.667
how you can be
so completely dumb.

23:24.667 --> 23:26.166
- Oh, my God.
- That's my problem.

23:26.166 --> 23:27.875
- Dumb?
- Yeah, not technically dumb,

23:27.875 --> 23:32.542
but, you know, at a core
spiritual level.

23:32.542 --> 23:34.000
Well, at least
I'm not the one crying

23:34.000 --> 23:36.708
about how I'm too smart
for grad school.

23:36.708 --> 23:38.125
How dumb is that?

23:38.125 --> 23:39.750
Okay, I never said too smart.
I said too wise.

23:39.750 --> 23:41.959
Okay, well,
if you're so wise,
then why are you running

23:41.959 --> 23:43.667
a coffee shop
in Bumfuck, Brooklyn?

23:43.667 --> 23:46.750
I could ask you
the same question right now
about those bracelets.

23:46.750 --> 23:49.959
Who goes to the gym
with pavé diamond bracelets?

23:49.959 --> 23:51.333
These aren't
fucking pavé.

23:51.333 --> 23:52.667
They're not even
close to pavé.

23:52.667 --> 23:54.959
You don't even
know what pavé is.
Who's the dumb one now?

23:54.959 --> 23:58.041
Okay, look, you may
think my position is
counterintuitive,

23:58.041 --> 24:01.500
but it comes from a deep
and unwavering love for
Africa and its peoples.

24:01.500 --> 24:04.333
Okay, I love Africa!

24:04.333 --> 24:06.500
Fucking weird
thing to say.

24:07.834 --> 24:09.708
Okay.

24:09.708 --> 24:11.041
That didn't--

24:11.041 --> 24:12.708
that didn't come out
the way I wanted it to.

24:12.708 --> 24:14.875
- Which part?
- Most of it.

24:14.875 --> 24:16.625
Most of the back end
part of it.

24:16.625 --> 24:19.917
I apologize for that.
Could you please sit down?

24:19.917 --> 24:21.250
Why?

24:21.250 --> 24:25.333
'Cause you have no one else
to eat lunch with

24:25.333 --> 24:27.625
and neither do I.

24:31.708 --> 24:34.542
Thank you.

24:34.542 --> 24:36.834
- Dumplings were
pretty good.
- Mm-hmm.

24:36.834 --> 24:39.125
- Should we get
some more?
- Mmm.

24:39.125 --> 24:41.959
Excuse me, ma'am.
Could we get some more
dumplings, please?

24:46.875 --> 24:49.708
( crying )

24:54.542 --> 24:56.583
( phone rings )

24:58.166 --> 24:59.625
Hannah Horvath.

24:59.625 --> 25:01.083
Joe:
Are you crying?

25:01.083 --> 25:03.875
No. Why, did someone
hear me or something?

25:03.875 --> 25:07.458
No, but you're okay?

25:09.000 --> 25:12.750
Uh, yeah.
I'm okay.

25:12.750 --> 25:14.125
Okay. Good.

25:14.125 --> 25:16.375
You know, you could still
be a writer and do this job.

25:16.375 --> 25:19.250
You've just got to--
you've got to maintain
your focus, you know?

25:19.250 --> 25:22.458
You've got to write
every night after work
and on the weekends.

25:22.458 --> 25:25.250
- Is that what you do?
- Yeah, that's what I do.

25:25.250 --> 25:28.291
I mean, no, I've definitely
slacked off a little bit

25:28.291 --> 25:30.917
in the past year or two,
but it's doable.

25:30.917 --> 25:32.542
No, you know what?
You're right.

25:32.542 --> 25:35.000
You're so right.
Nights and weekends.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.083
Exactly.
Anyway, I've got to go.

25:38.083 --> 25:39.500
( hangs up )

25:39.500 --> 25:41.792
Okay, so now that we're
officially a couple,

25:41.792 --> 25:44.542
I think that we should
have no less than four
hang nights a week.

25:44.542 --> 25:47.792
- Cool.
- Potential hang night
activities include

25:47.792 --> 25:51.750
non-sports TV watching,
light reading,

25:51.750 --> 25:53.875
board games,

25:53.875 --> 25:56.041
comparing playlists.

25:56.041 --> 25:58.208
Can we maybe just talk
about this later?

25:58.208 --> 26:00.792
Honest and open
communication about
mutual needs

26:00.792 --> 26:03.291
is, like, the cornerstone
to any healthy relationship.

26:03.291 --> 26:04.792
I know, but I just--

26:04.792 --> 26:07.750
If you're afraid of intimacy,
then maybe you're just not
ready for this.

26:07.750 --> 26:09.500
- Do you want me
to stop?
- No.

26:09.500 --> 26:12.917
There's no need to terminate
sex just because we're not
meant for each other.

26:12.917 --> 26:16.041
God, you're so dumb, Parker.

26:16.041 --> 26:18.708
- Can you pull that harder?
- Uh-huh.

26:18.708 --> 26:20.708
Thanks.

26:23.125 --> 26:24.917
We could also,
like, just snuggle.

26:24.917 --> 26:28.000
- Sometimes
just snuggling is good.
- I like snuggling so much.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.667
( grunts )

26:31.041 --> 26:34.667
Well, today was not
as good as yesterday.

26:34.667 --> 26:38.041
- So...
- ( crying )

26:38.041 --> 26:40.917
What's wrong, Adam?

26:40.917 --> 26:42.792
What's going on?

26:42.792 --> 26:46.500
I got a callback
from an audition

26:46.500 --> 26:48.542
that I killed.
I fucking murdered it.

26:48.542 --> 26:52.667
I cut its fucking guts out
and left it in a Dumpster
by the side of the road.

26:52.667 --> 26:55.500
Oh, my God!
I'm so happy for you.

26:55.500 --> 26:57.375
But, baby, I actually have
to go and write right now

26:57.375 --> 27:01.250
because I'm doing a new thing
where I write every night for
three hours no matter what.

27:01.250 --> 27:02.750
- No, no, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes.

27:02.750 --> 27:04.625
It's for our future.
I love you.

27:04.625 --> 27:06.333
I really do.
I'm so proud of you

27:06.333 --> 27:08.291
and I can't wait to hear
all about it later

27:08.291 --> 27:10.333
when I'm done
with my writing time.

27:10.333 --> 27:12.458
You should have seen
these other fucking jabronis

27:12.458 --> 27:14.208
they called in
for the audition.

27:14.208 --> 27:16.834
They were all keyed up
and nervous like it
really mattered.

27:16.834 --> 27:18.375
And I-- I--

27:18.375 --> 27:21.208
you know, I showed up late
because I wasn't even sure
if I was gonna go.

27:21.208 --> 27:23.750
So I kind of got there
last minute and they just
slipped me in.

27:23.750 --> 27:27.708
Only had 10 minutes
to look at the sides
that they'd given me.

27:44.417 --> 27:46.542
