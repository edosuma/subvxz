-[explosions]
-[blaster fire]

00:40.874 --> 00:42.792
How much longer
until we're in hyperspace, Tech?

00:42.876 --> 00:46.379
That depends on when Echo plans
on getting the drive back online.

00:46.463 --> 00:47.630
I'm working on it!

00:47.714 --> 00:49.174
-[explosion]
-[creature squawks]

00:49.841 --> 00:52.093
I don't think Ruby likes this very much.

00:52.761 --> 00:54.054
You named that thing?

00:56.014 --> 00:57.599
What's with these guys?

00:57.682 --> 00:59.517
-Well, we did steal from them.
-[Ruby hisses]

00:59.601 --> 01:01.978
Technically,
the Rhokai stole the lizard first.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.438
We are merely intercepting it.

01:03.521 --> 01:04.939
They don't see it that way.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.401
[Ruby squawks]

01:08.485 --> 01:10.653
[Wrecker screaming]
It's loose! It's loose! [grunts]

01:11.279 --> 01:13.615
Get it off! Get it off. Get it off!

01:13.698 --> 01:15.700
Stay calm. You're scaring her.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.869
Get it off. Get it off. Get it off!

01:17.952 --> 01:18.953
[Ruby squeals]

01:20.663 --> 01:22.123
Hyperdrive's online.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.416
-[Ruby hisses]
-Got her.

01:29.964 --> 01:32.175
[Ruby growls]

01:32.258 --> 01:34.511
-That is one strange-looking lizard.
-[Ruby hissing]

01:34.594 --> 01:36.054
What's your client want it for?

01:36.137 --> 01:40.308
Maybe it's a pet. Maybe he wants to turn
it into a stew. Don't know, don't care.

01:40.392 --> 01:42.018
As long as you get paid.

01:42.977 --> 01:44.396
Now you're catching on.

01:44.479 --> 01:47.732
And guess what?
That means you get paid too.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.317
Bring the lizard in the back.

01:52.696 --> 01:53.905
[Ruby squeals]

01:58.159 --> 01:59.160
[Omega] Hunter?

02:00.995 --> 02:03.748
What are you two up to?

02:03.832 --> 02:06.626
The mission's over. Can we go?

02:06.710 --> 02:08.086
Again?

02:08.169 --> 02:09.921
It's a tradition.

02:10.505 --> 02:12.549
It makes the kid happy.

02:12.632 --> 02:13.842
Uh-huh.

02:13.925 --> 02:15.176
The kid.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.637
[sighs] Don't take long.

02:17.721 --> 02:18.888
[Wrecker laughs]

02:29.941 --> 02:31.359
All right, fellas, here's your cut.

02:32.027 --> 02:34.029
-[cage rattling]
-[Ruby snorting]

02:34.112 --> 02:35.280
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:35.363 --> 02:37.532
You said the job paid three times this.

02:37.615 --> 02:39.951
For me, not for you.

02:40.035 --> 02:43.288
And just how is this
a mutually beneficial arrangement?

02:43.371 --> 02:45.290
You're breathing, aren't you?

02:45.373 --> 02:47.917
Rather generous
considering the debt you owe me.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.169
What debt?

02:52.047 --> 02:56.801
Docking fees, port charges,
gear, fuel, rations,

02:56.885 --> 03:00.096
and 20 cartons of Mantell Mix.

03:02.349 --> 03:04.184
Best part of the mission.

03:05.393 --> 03:06.394
Mm-hmm.

03:06.478 --> 03:08.980
That'll be 14 credits for the Mantell Mix.

03:09.064 --> 03:11.858
-[Omega] Mmm.
-Uh, yeah... uh, put it on Cid's tab.

03:16.613 --> 03:21.159
Hey, you're in my seat. Move it!

03:23.787 --> 03:26.206
Oh, he's ignoring you.

03:26.873 --> 03:30.377
You hearing me? I said move it.

03:33.004 --> 03:37.592
Now, I like you boys,
but I'm not running a charity here.

03:37.676 --> 03:40.804
You need a big score for us to be square.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.263
Like what?

03:42.347 --> 03:46.393
Like retrieving that tactical droid,
but you bungled that op.

03:46.476 --> 03:51.064
I suggest you figure something out
before you see my ugly side.

03:51.147 --> 03:52.691
That's not her ugly side?

03:52.774 --> 03:54.693
What was that, goggles?

03:54.776 --> 03:56.861
-[blaster fires]
-[crash]

03:56.945 --> 03:57.946
[blaster fires]

03:58.029 --> 03:59.197
[aliens screaming]

03:59.280 --> 04:02.409
[big alien] Move! Out of my way!

04:08.123 --> 04:10.500
Hey, what's going on in here?

04:12.168 --> 04:13.336
Who are you?

04:19.175 --> 04:20.176
Rex?

04:22.470 --> 04:26.975
Oh, great. Another clone.
Just what I needed.

04:27.475 --> 04:29.185
Well, don't get comfy.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.855
I'm done taking in strays.

04:31.938 --> 04:35.275
This ain't a clone clubhouse, ya know.

04:35.358 --> 04:38.737
Unbelievable. Thinkin' they own the place.

04:40.572 --> 04:41.573
Captain.

04:42.198 --> 04:44.117
[Rex] It's been a while, boys.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.703
Where have you been, Rex?

04:47.454 --> 04:48.455
Hmm.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.457
That's a long story.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.713
And when the war ended,

04:56.796 --> 05:01.051
I guess you could say
I've been... keeping a low profile.

05:01.801 --> 05:05.472
Very low. Imperial files have you listed
as killed in action.

05:06.389 --> 05:10.018
Being dead in the Empire's eyes
has its advantages.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.228
Well, how'd you track us down?

05:12.812 --> 05:14.606
Trace and Rafa Martez.

05:14.689 --> 05:17.942
They said a squad of rogue clones
helped them on Corellia.

05:20.362 --> 05:23.656
They told me I could find you here.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.700
And that you were traveling with a kid.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.911
Who is she?

05:27.994 --> 05:31.373
Omega. She's a clone like us.

05:32.290 --> 05:35.543
Well, look who it is. [laughs]

05:37.045 --> 05:38.630
Come here, Rex. [laughs]

05:38.713 --> 05:41.132
[grunts] Yeah.
Good to see you too, Wrecker.

05:41.216 --> 05:43.802
I thought you didn't like the regs.

05:43.885 --> 05:45.512
[Wrecker] This one we like.

05:46.971 --> 05:49.432
Omega, this is Rex.

05:52.519 --> 05:57.065
I've met many clones in my time,
but never one like you.

06:02.529 --> 06:03.822
You're a generation one.

06:04.489 --> 06:05.782
Now how'd you know that?

06:05.865 --> 06:07.534
From the lines on your face.

06:08.076 --> 06:09.703
[Rex chuckles]

06:09.786 --> 06:11.955
Yeah, I guess I've been around.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.540
You got that right.

06:13.623 --> 06:14.833
[groans]

06:14.916 --> 06:18.378
Tech, I need one of those med patches.

06:18.461 --> 06:19.713
[Tech] You used the last one.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.423
What's wrong?

06:21.506 --> 06:24.092
Nothing. It's just a headache.

06:24.175 --> 06:25.635
Which are becoming more frequent.

06:26.344 --> 06:27.846
Is that so?

06:30.140 --> 06:33.685
If you're concerned about the so-called
inhibitor chips, don't be.

06:33.768 --> 06:37.230
Our deviant nature appears
to have impeded their functionality.

06:37.313 --> 06:38.606
Except in Crosshair.

06:39.190 --> 06:43.028
You're telling me
you haven't removed your chips?

06:43.111 --> 06:44.404
No, not yet.

06:47.365 --> 06:48.450
Rex?

06:48.533 --> 06:52.829
Those chips make you a threat
to everyone around you. Even her.

06:53.621 --> 06:55.498
You're all ticking time bombs.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.959
Take it easy, Captain.

06:58.043 --> 07:02.255
What's in your head is more dangerous
than you can imagine.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.924
I've seen what happens
when the chip activates,

07:05.008 --> 07:07.594
and I don't want to bury any more
of our brothers.

07:09.095 --> 07:13.099
Trust me.
It is not something you can control.

07:13.183 --> 07:14.434
I couldn't.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.480
It's a risk you do not want to take.

07:23.568 --> 07:25.320
How do you suggest we get them out?

07:28.573 --> 07:31.993
Good question. I'll be in touch.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.295
[Gonky honking]

07:42.379 --> 07:43.546
[groans]

07:48.259 --> 07:50.679
[groans] I don't like this plan.

07:50.762 --> 07:54.015
We agreed to meet Rex on Bracca.
That's what we're doing.

07:54.099 --> 07:56.017
He wants to cut open my head.

07:56.101 --> 07:57.977
All of our heads actually.

07:58.061 --> 08:00.230
Not mine. I don't have an inhibitor chip.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.233
Why not? Now, that's not fair.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.943
How's the chip scanner coming?

08:05.026 --> 08:08.738
Since Rex's chip was removed,
I am able to establish a baseline

08:08.822 --> 08:10.949
by comparing his brain scan to ours.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.785
Allowing for the detection
of any cellular anomaly.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.788
He means, "It's almost finished."

08:17.330 --> 08:20.417
Do we really have to do this?

08:20.500 --> 08:23.920
If Rex is sure, we should trust him.

08:34.180 --> 08:35.223
[console beeps]

08:36.433 --> 08:38.768
[Omega] What is this place?

08:38.852 --> 08:40.061
[Hunter] A starship graveyard.

08:40.145 --> 08:42.063
-[console whistles]
-I'm picking up Rex's beacon.

09:05.754 --> 09:06.838
Right on time.

09:07.505 --> 09:09.591
How's a junk planet gonna help us?

09:10.550 --> 09:11.676
[Rex] Follow me.

09:24.064 --> 09:28.860
Bracca may not be much to look at,
but it has exactly what we need.

09:28.943 --> 09:33.156
I had my inhibitor chip taken out
on a Jedi cruiser just like that.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.449
That's where we're heading.

09:34.532 --> 09:36.451
[Wrecker]
Then why'd we land all the way over here?

09:36.534 --> 09:37.535
[Hunter] Everyone down.

09:39.704 --> 09:41.081
[Rex] That's why.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.043
[Tech] It's the Scrapper Guild.

09:45.126 --> 09:47.212
[Rex] They control this entire planet.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.340
We need to keep out of sight
from their patrols.

09:51.633 --> 09:52.634
Let's move.

10:01.935 --> 10:07.982
Fives tried to warn me about the chips,
but I didn't understand at the time.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.110
[Echo] It's still hard to believe now.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.821
[Rex]
How did you boys find out about them?

10:12.904 --> 10:13.905
[Echo] Omega.

10:14.864 --> 10:15.865
[Rex] The kid?

10:18.076 --> 10:20.495
[rumbling]

10:22.747 --> 10:24.582
[metal groaning]

10:29.921 --> 10:31.006
[Omega] Whoa.

10:31.589 --> 10:33.591
It's much bigger up close.

10:36.302 --> 10:40.473
[Rex] This is an original <i>Venator</i>-class
ship from the first batch off the line.

10:41.099 --> 10:45.270
[Wrecker] First off the line, huh?
Just like you, Rex.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.354
[laughs]

10:51.735 --> 10:52.736
[Tech] What is it?

10:54.487 --> 10:56.531
[Hunter] Stay above the waterline.

11:03.413 --> 11:07.292
[metal rumbling, groaning]

11:17.927 --> 11:22.974
[Rex] The last time I was aboard one
of these it didn't end so well.

11:23.058 --> 11:27.270
[Echo] If the inhibitor chip isn't
something you can control,

11:27.354 --> 11:28.897
how'd you get yours out?

11:29.647 --> 11:31.775
[Rex] I had help.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.612
[water splashes]

11:36.196 --> 11:37.822
The medical bay's at the other end.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.408
Wrecker, grab that cable.

11:42.660 --> 11:45.580
[Wrecker] This? W-Why?
W-W-What are you gonna do with it?

11:50.877 --> 11:52.379
-[Rex] Nicely done.
-[Omega grunts]

11:52.462 --> 11:53.463
[Echo] You're up, Wrecker.

11:53.546 --> 11:54.673
[Wrecker] Uh...

11:54.756 --> 11:58.677
Yeah, my head doesn't hurt anymore.
I'm fine. You guys go without me.

11:58.760 --> 12:01.596
You can do it.
Just keep your eyes on the cable.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.014
[Wrecker groans]

12:03.848 --> 12:05.433
[grunts, exhales]

12:11.147 --> 12:12.482
Whoa!

12:13.858 --> 12:15.068
Whoa!

12:16.361 --> 12:18.196
That was close.

12:18.279 --> 12:20.198
-[Wrecker screams, grunts]
-[Rex] Wrecker!

12:21.074 --> 12:22.826
[Wrecker] Whoa, whoa! [grunts]

12:23.618 --> 12:25.745
[grunting]

12:27.330 --> 12:29.040
[Rex] Are you all right?

12:29.624 --> 12:32.544
[Wrecker] No! Smells awful down here!

12:32.627 --> 12:33.628
[gags]

12:35.714 --> 12:38.800
-What's that?
-[Hunter] Wrecker, start climbing.

12:38.883 --> 12:41.011
-[Wrecker] Why?
-Hurry!

12:42.012 --> 12:44.180
-[dianoga roars]
-[Wrecker grunts, shouts]

12:44.264 --> 12:46.141
-Wrecker!
-[Hunter] Grab the cable. Get him up.

12:46.224 --> 12:47.392
[Wrecker grunts]

12:47.475 --> 12:48.727
[dianoga screams]

12:49.811 --> 12:51.521
[Wrecker] Faster! Pull faster!

12:52.355 --> 12:53.815
-[dianoga roars]
-[Wrecker shouts]

12:53.898 --> 12:55.608
[Hunter, Rex grunting]

12:55.692 --> 12:56.943
[Wrecker] Whoa, whoa!

12:57.027 --> 12:58.236
[dianoga roars]

12:59.738 --> 13:01.156
[dianoga growls]

13:01.239 --> 13:02.157
[Rex] Wrecker!

13:07.537 --> 13:09.122
[water bubbles]

13:10.915 --> 13:12.334
-[Wrecker grunts]
-Pull!

-[Wrecker shouts]
-[dianoga roars]

13:17.255 --> 13:18.340
[Wrecker] Whoa!

13:19.215 --> 13:22.135
-[dianoga growls, screams]
-[Wrecker] Whoa, whoa... [shouts]

13:25.180 --> 13:26.848
[strains, coughs]

13:26.931 --> 13:30.643
-[breathing heavily] What was... that?
-[Hunter, Rex strain]

13:30.727 --> 13:31.728
[Wrecker coughs]

13:31.811 --> 13:33.605
[Rex breathing heavily]

13:33.688 --> 13:36.024
Makes you miss battling clankers,
doesn't it?

13:36.107 --> 13:38.485
[groans] Yeah.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.029
[rat squeaks]

13:49.329 --> 13:53.124
-[door groans]
-[rat squeaks]

[rats chatter]

14:00.215 --> 14:01.716
[rat squeaks, chatters]

14:01.800 --> 14:03.385
This will do nicely.

14:03.468 --> 14:07.097
[Tech] I would no longer call
this medical bay a sterile environment.

14:07.180 --> 14:10.225
Do you prefer to use the facility
on Kamino?

14:10.308 --> 14:11.518
[Tech] This will do nicely.

14:13.895 --> 14:15.563
I'll calibrate the surgical pod.

14:20.443 --> 14:22.070
-[screen beeps]
-[electricity pulsating]

14:24.614 --> 14:26.324
Time to get scanned, Wrecker.

14:26.408 --> 14:28.702
Let's get this over with.

14:28.785 --> 14:29.911
[groans]

14:32.205 --> 14:33.415
[device beeps]

14:38.086 --> 14:39.921
[scanner beeping]

14:41.381 --> 14:42.841
-[device whines]
-[Wrecker groans]

14:49.973 --> 14:54.644
Hunter, just because the surgery worked
on Rex, doesn't mean it's safe.

14:55.729 --> 14:57.897
This is dangerous.

14:58.481 --> 15:01.526
It's more dangerous
to leave their inhibitor chips in.

15:01.609 --> 15:05.030
We have to do this. It's worth the risk.

15:05.113 --> 15:07.115
And what if something goes wrong?

15:08.116 --> 15:10.952
I'll be left here with no one.

15:16.541 --> 15:18.418
We're not going anywhere, Omega.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.212
You're stuck with us for the long run.

15:21.296 --> 15:22.547
Got it?

15:24.299 --> 15:26.217
[scanner beeping]

15:26.301 --> 15:28.678
[Tech] I think I found something.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.681
Ninety degrees
from his right orbital floor,

15:31.765 --> 15:33.850
below the parietal
and temporal intersection...

15:34.434 --> 15:37.729
Get that away from me.

15:37.812 --> 15:39.105
[groaning]

15:39.189 --> 15:40.774
Something's not right.

15:40.857 --> 15:42.734
We need to speed this up.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.158
[pod hums]

15:50.658 --> 15:52.410
[machinery whirs, clanks]

15:54.079 --> 15:55.705
[Rex] You boys got lucky.

15:55.789 --> 15:59.751
Very few clones were immune
to the effects of Order 66.

16:00.251 --> 16:02.629
It's rare.

16:02.712 --> 16:07.467
When the regs attacked the Jedi on Kaller,
we didn't understand why.

16:07.550 --> 16:09.177
[groaning continues]

16:09.260 --> 16:13.556
[Hunter] We couldn't save the general,
but at least we helped the Padawan escape.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.809
Relax, this won't hurt a bit.

16:20.897 --> 16:21.815
[grunts]

16:24.192 --> 16:25.568
[Tech grunts, gasps]

16:25.652 --> 16:26.653
Wrecker.

16:27.946 --> 16:31.241
You're in direct violation of Order 66.

16:32.409 --> 16:34.828
[bellows]

16:38.289 --> 16:39.833
Wrecker?

16:46.589 --> 16:49.259
He'll destroy the equipment
if we don't get him out of here.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.011
[Wrecker] You're all traitors.

16:53.680 --> 16:54.681
We'll draw him out.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.558
Omega, stay with Tech.

16:58.893 --> 17:01.021
[Wrecker coughs]

17:02.647 --> 17:04.024
[sighs, grunts]

17:05.734 --> 17:07.736

17:25.253 --> 17:26.379
[Hunter shouts]

17:26.463 --> 17:28.673
[both grunting]

17:32.135 --> 17:33.303
[shouts]

17:34.512 --> 17:38.099
[grunts] Come on, Wrecker. Snap out of it.

17:38.183 --> 17:39.392
[both grunting]

17:42.228 --> 17:43.521
[Hunter groans]

17:45.023 --> 17:48.568
All clones in violation of Order 66
shall be terminated.

17:48.651 --> 17:49.652
[Hunter choking]

17:49.736 --> 17:50.737
[blaster fires]

17:50.820 --> 17:51.905
Huh? [growls]

18:01.373 --> 18:02.791
[Omega panting]

18:08.296 --> 18:09.589
[Omega breathing heavily]

18:14.511 --> 18:16.262

-[gasps]

18:19.224 --> 18:20.642
[electricity crackling]

18:20.725 --> 18:23.687
[breathing heavily]

18:26.940 --> 18:28.608
[Wrecker roars]

18:45.417 --> 18:47.002
[exhales]

18:56.177 --> 18:58.722
[rat squeaks, chatters]

19:00.682 --> 19:01.766
[footsteps approach]

19:06.146 --> 19:07.230
[Wrecker grunts]

19:07.897 --> 19:11.776
This isn't you, Wrecker.
It's the inhibitor chip.

19:11.860 --> 19:15.989
Conspiring with traitors makes you guilty
of treason.

19:16.906 --> 19:20.618
Please, stop. I don't want to hurt you.

19:24.247 --> 19:25.290
[Wrecker grunts]

19:27.000 --> 19:29.669
But, Wrecker, I'm your friend.

19:31.296 --> 19:35.633
Good soldiers follow orders.

19:35.717 --> 19:37.093
-[blaster fires]
-[groans]

19:48.772 --> 19:50.940
Is it supposed to take this long?

19:51.024 --> 19:56.446
I'm not sure.
I've never been on this end of it.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.161
[console hums]

20:03.244 --> 20:04.662
[Tech] The procedure's complete.

20:10.710 --> 20:11.711
Wrecker.

20:14.673 --> 20:15.674
Wrecker!

20:17.467 --> 20:19.135
He should be awake by now.

20:20.512 --> 20:22.764
-[console hums]
-He is alive,

20:22.847 --> 20:24.683
but his vitals have not stabilized.

20:24.766 --> 20:27.394
We won't know more
until he regains consciousness.

20:34.484 --> 20:36.236
This could be a while.

20:36.820 --> 20:40.281
Why don't you take Omega topside
and get some air?

20:40.365 --> 20:41.366
[Omega] No.

20:42.325 --> 20:44.744
I'm staying until he wakes up.

21:10.186 --> 21:11.187
[Wrecker grunts]

21:11.271 --> 21:15.442
Hey, kid. Why-- Why the long face?

21:15.525 --> 21:16.776
He's awake!

21:17.485 --> 21:19.154
Oh. You made it.

21:21.197 --> 21:23.450
-Welcome back.
-[Wrecker chuckles, groans]

21:23.533 --> 21:27.579
One chip down. Three to go. Who's next?

21:30.040 --> 21:32.167
[machinery whirs]

21:48.141 --> 21:49.267
[Wrecker grunts]

21:50.018 --> 21:52.103
Listen, Omega.

21:53.646 --> 21:54.981
About what happened...

21:57.025 --> 22:02.405
I-- I tried to control it.
I tried as hard as I could.

22:02.489 --> 22:05.408
I just couldn't make it stop.

22:05.492 --> 22:08.161
I know, Wrecker. It's okay.

22:08.244 --> 22:12.207
But still... I-- I'm sorry.

22:16.127 --> 22:17.128
[gasps]

22:17.212 --> 22:18.588
The mission's over.

22:19.589 --> 22:21.299
We can't break tradition.

22:22.550 --> 22:24.094
Thanks, kid.

22:25.512 --> 22:26.513
[chuckles]

22:29.307 --> 22:30.642
[Omega] Mmm.

22:34.396 --> 22:36.398
[person speaks on comm, indistinct]

22:36.481 --> 22:39.984
Copy that. I'll meet you at the rendezvous
by the next rotation.

22:40.902 --> 22:43.279
I figured you weren't out
of the fight just yet.

22:45.740 --> 22:49.536
I spent my life defending the Republic.
Can't stop now.

22:49.619 --> 22:51.579
The Republic's gone, Rex.

22:52.163 --> 22:57.836
Ah, not all of it. We're here.
Others are out there too.

22:58.712 --> 23:01.881
Your squad's skills would be
a tremendous asset.

23:02.465 --> 23:07.345
Things aren't like before.
Our priorities have shifted.

23:07.971 --> 23:09.097
So I've noticed.

23:10.265 --> 23:14.394
Omega needs us, and I have to do
what's best for my squad.

23:15.311 --> 23:16.688
Which is what?

23:17.355 --> 23:19.149
I'm still figuring that out.

23:20.316 --> 23:22.402
I guess we all are.

23:23.236 --> 23:27.073
When you sort things out,
let me know where you land.

23:27.157 --> 23:29.284
Tell the boys I'll see them around.

23:29.367 --> 23:30.827
[Hunter] Stay out of trouble.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.580
Funny. I was gonna say the same to you.

23:34.706 --> 23:35.707
Well...

23:36.958 --> 23:38.084
Take care, trooper.

23:41.129 --> 23:42.130
[Hunter] Captain.

23:43.757 --> 23:47.677
If you're ever in a bind,
you know how to reach us.

24:07.781 --> 24:11.910
[scrapper] Intruders confirmed
on the Jedi Cruiser. Notify the Empire.
