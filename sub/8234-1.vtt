        something really
        interesting, man?

    I was gonna wear a suit
    in this interview,

00:06.539 --> 00:08.807

    have been too much,

00:08.875 --> 00:10.743

    these nice sweatpants on

    you know, too much, I think.

there may be oc-occasions where
I--it may take me a little while

00:55.688 --> 01:00.826
to respond, um, but that's
only because, um, it's--

I'm just trying to process
the--the incoming speech,

    process the answer.

or not, so that is something

to have somebody in my life,

    married to that person,

01:59.119 --> 02:00.786
    I wasn't sure about.

    you got to ask me?

    about documentaries.

        think about this, OK?

03:35.848 --> 03:39.151

        stubborn, arrogant,

really want to be autistic,

maybe she'll be like, "I don't
want to be with you no more

            it goes.

17:34.353 --> 17:35.653
    OK.

17:35.721 --> 17:36.754
            That's the way
            the show goes.

17:36.822 --> 17:38.623
        I'm not gonna let her
        pay for everything

17:38.690 --> 17:40.825
        and me, you know,
        I got to be the one

17:40.893 --> 17:43.327
            that...

17:43.395 --> 17:45.396
        is the more independent
        one than her.

17:45.464 --> 17:47.231
But I don't think
that that's fair.

17:47.299 --> 17:48.266
            No, it is fair.

17:48.333 --> 17:49.500
Kind of chauvinistic.

17:49.568 --> 17:50.568
            No, it's not.

17:50.636 --> 17:51.636
I think a little bit.

17:51.703 --> 17:53.438
I mean, what if there's
a woman out there

17:53.505 --> 17:55.473
that is perfect for you

17:55.541 --> 17:56.674
but she makes more money
than you do?

17:56.742 --> 17:59.544
            Nope.
            I won't take her.

17:59.611 --> 18:01.779
            I'm serious.
            I won't take her.

    to be different.

    He just wants to be
    like everybody else,

18:06.852 --> 18:10.054
    so then he goes above
    and, like, kind of goes

18:10.122 --> 18:12.457
    beyond trying to fit in,
    and everybody--

18:12.524 --> 18:14.725
I can see they're like,
"Why is he acting like this?"

18:14.793 --> 18:17.562
        Like, we all know
        Lenny's special,

18:17.629 --> 18:19.964
    so he just needs to be
    who he is, and he's not.

18:20.032 --> 18:21.833
    He tries to be
    something different.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.101
            Lenny: I need to
            be the one

18:23.168 --> 18:25.736
            making more money.

18:25.804 --> 18:28.272
            I hear so many
            things about--

18:28.340 --> 18:29.874
            I hear so many
            YouTube videos

18:29.942 --> 18:30.875
            about women.

18:30.943 --> 18:31.976
By men. OK--

18:32.044 --> 18:33.544
            No. It's a woman
            saying,

18:33.612 --> 18:35.746
            "Don't be
            with broke-ass men."

18:35.814 --> 18:37.381
    Wow.

18:38.250 --> 18:39.150
These are the kind
of women--

18:39.218 --> 18:40.718
            No, they're trying
            to inform the women

18:40.786 --> 18:41.652
            not to be
            with broke men,

18:41.720 --> 18:42.653
            and I don't want
            to be--

18:42.721 --> 18:43.721
            I don't want to be
            a broke male

18:43.789 --> 18:44.689
            with a woman.

18:44.756 --> 18:45.890
        I don't want her
        paying for everything.

18:45.958 --> 18:46.991
        I need to be the one--

18:47.059 --> 18:48.726
You don't have to be
paying for everything--

18:48.794 --> 18:50.661
or she doesn't have to
be paying for everything.

18:50.729 --> 18:51.896
You could be paying
for stuff,

18:51.964 --> 18:53.931
but when you get into
a relationship with somebody,

18:53.999 --> 18:56.767
you're supposed to be
their partner. Partner.

18:56.835 --> 18:58.369
            Well, I need to be
            the one doing more.

18:58.437 --> 18:59.871
            That's the way
            it goes.

18:59.938 --> 19:01.472
I don't think
that's the way it goes.

19:01.540 --> 19:04.275
I think that you're
being misinformed

19:04.343 --> 19:07.211
by people that are just
not really great people.

19:07.279 --> 19:08.746
I think you're
being misinformed.

19:08.814 --> 19:09.814
                I'm not.

19:09.882 --> 19:10.982
I think you are.

19:11.049 --> 19:12.016
What if you find
somebody--

19:12.084 --> 19:14.051
and I'm just saying
if you love somebody,

19:14.119 --> 19:15.520
it shouldn't matter.

19:15.587 --> 19:17.455
It should be, like,
you just love her,

19:17.523 --> 19:20.091
and maybe one day you'll
be making more money,

19:20.159 --> 19:21.726
and you guys just
support each other

19:21.793 --> 19:24.896
in that good kind of
like foundation and--

19:24.963 --> 19:26.297
            It's just hard.

19:26.365 --> 19:28.132
            It's just hard
            to believe that.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.333
Why?

19:29.401 --> 19:31.769
    It's just about being
    the more independent one.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.671
But you will be
independent.

19:33.739 --> 19:35.072
You're going to
be independent.

19:35.140 --> 19:36.741
That is gonna
happen, Lenny.

19:36.808 --> 19:39.443
Sometimes it takes
a minute for people.

19:39.511 --> 19:43.781
It's hard. That transition
from fricking--into manhood?

19:43.849 --> 19:44.882
That thing, that's hard.

19:44.950 --> 19:45.917
                I know.

19:45.984 --> 19:47.318
I couldn't even--
it was hard--

19:47.386 --> 19:49.587
            I'm good,
            though, Mom.

19:49.655 --> 19:50.955
            I'm trying
            to be good.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.290
Well, trying to be
good how?

19:52.357 --> 19:54.792
I want you
to feel good.

19:55.894 --> 19:56.961
            I'm just going
            through

19:57.029 --> 20:00.097
            a little bit
            of a struggle.

20:00.165 --> 20:02.033
            I'm down on myself
            too many times,

20:02.100 --> 20:04.969
            and it's too tough
            because I feel like

20:05.037 --> 20:07.004
            I should be accept--
            doing more in life.

20:07.072 --> 20:08.606
Do you think--
do you consider yourself

20:08.674 --> 20:10.141
like less sometimes?

20:10.209 --> 20:11.209
That's kind of what
I get.

20:11.276 --> 20:12.210
            Sometimes.

20:12.277 --> 20:13.344
Why?

20:13.412 --> 20:14.946
        I feel different.

20:15.013 --> 20:17.582
        I feel better than being
        autistic sometimes.

20:17.649 --> 20:19.317
Let's get past this.

20:19.384 --> 20:22.153
Let's get over this
and get on with it

20:22.221 --> 20:23.554
because you're
fricking awesome.

20:23.622 --> 20:25.523
            I know. I know.

20:25.591 --> 20:26.591
I don't think you do.

20:26.658 --> 20:28.059
                I know.

20:28.126 --> 20:31.028
I think you don't
and you need to know.

20:31.096 --> 20:32.830
                    OK.
I love you.

20:33.799 --> 20:36.067
    Kathy: He's really
    down on himself.

20:36.134 --> 20:37.068
I think once he starts working,

20:37.135 --> 20:38.102
    he's gonna feel
    better about himself.

20:38.170 --> 20:39.170
He's gonna feel more productive,

20:39.238 --> 20:40.571
    like he's out there
    doing something.

20:40.639 --> 20:43.708
Because right now he doesn't
feel like he's doing anything.

20:46.945 --> 20:48.012
    Man on TV: Some points
    in Massachusetts

20:48.080 --> 20:50.114
    and Rhode Island could see
    up to a foot of snow,

20:50.182 --> 20:52.183
and in New Jersey,
well, the storm is certainly...

20:52.251 --> 20:55.820
Lindsey, voice-over: I always
knew I was different,

20:55.887 --> 21:01.959
    even before I was informed
    of my diagnosis of autism,

21:02.027 --> 21:07.064
    though I always felt like
    I was an odd character

21:07.132 --> 21:10.635
    outside of my--my peers.

21:10.702 --> 21:15.606
    But I didn't really
    understand why.

21:18.510 --> 21:19.977
I would often get turned away,

21:20.045 --> 21:22.546
    or people would ignore me,
    and I--I thought,

21:22.614 --> 21:25.049
"Well, what am I doing wrong?"

21:25.117 --> 21:30.121
And even after learning about
    my own diagnosis,

21:30.188 --> 21:35.626
I still, for several years,
struggled to figure out

21:35.694 --> 21:39.897
    why I couldn't, um,
    maintain and keep friends,

21:39.965 --> 21:45.469
why I couldn't fit in,
why I couldn't be accepted.

21:51.376 --> 21:56.380
Unfortunately, I think the first
impressions I received, um,

21:56.448 --> 22:00.451
when I was learning about autism
    were quite negative,

22:00.519 --> 22:02.720
        and as a result,

22:02.788 --> 22:08.993
    I felt incredibly ashamed
    of being autistic.

22:09.061 --> 22:12.563
Every morning when I get ready,
I look in the mirror

22:12.631 --> 22:16.000
before I step outside the house,
and I think to myself,

22:16.068 --> 22:20.171
        "Well, I look OK.
        I look OK today."

22:20.238 --> 22:24.942
    And the moment I step
    outside the front door,

22:25.010 --> 22:27.278
    I immediately become
    self-conscious.

22:34.186 --> 22:37.955
I've recognized pretty quickly

22:38.023 --> 22:41.325
that the way I perceive myself

22:41.393 --> 22:45.830
    in the outside world

22:45.897 --> 22:48.999
is drastically different than
the way I perceive myself

22:49.067 --> 22:51.635
        in my own world.

22:51.703 --> 22:55.172
    In some aspects
    and at some times,

22:55.240 --> 22:58.776
I do feel like I have found
that personal happiness

22:58.844 --> 23:01.579
    within myself,
    or that personal peace.

23:06.752 --> 23:11.689
    But it's still very
    difficult for me

23:11.757 --> 23:17.895
    to find acceptance
    of myself.

23:20.098 --> 23:23.634
    I have just learned how
    to be a good actress.

24:04.476 --> 24:06.577
Woman: I remember when
you first started at work,

24:06.645 --> 24:11.315
and, um, I wasn't sure--
I wasn't necessarily sure

24:11.383 --> 24:13.250
what to expect
because, you know,

24:13.318 --> 24:15.886
everybody on the spectrum
is different, and...

24:15.954 --> 24:17.121
            Oh, yeah.
            Yeah, absolutely.

24:17.189 --> 24:19.490
you never know if
somebody is going to be

24:19.558 --> 24:23.994
very outgoing or--you know,
kind of the classic

24:24.062 --> 24:25.896
description of someone
on the spectrum

24:25.964 --> 24:28.065
is not--you know,
unfortunately,

24:28.133 --> 24:29.533
not interested,
empathetic,

24:29.601 --> 24:30.534
you know, not into--

24:30.602 --> 24:32.536
        I always had this fear
        people would be

24:32.604 --> 24:35.739
        staring at me, that...

24:35.807 --> 24:38.742
        people can see
        right through me.

24:38.810 --> 24:42.112
        I think it kind of
        relates to

24:42.180 --> 24:45.749
        my frustration I've
        had over the years

24:45.817 --> 24:48.452
            of...

24:48.520 --> 24:51.822
        being pressured to fit
        into the social norm...

24:53.925 --> 24:59.730
        that I'm not good enough
        if I don't fit in.

25:00.732 --> 25:02.399
Have you ever dated
somebody

25:02.467 --> 25:04.335
who was on
the spectrum before?

25:04.402 --> 25:07.171
        Actually, all--all
        the guys I've dated

25:07.239 --> 25:08.339
        prior to Dave were--

25:08.406 --> 25:09.607
        yeah, were not
        on the spectrum.

25:09.674 --> 25:11.175
        So Dave is the first.

25:11.243 --> 25:13.177
And how is it
different?

25:17.082 --> 25:18.549
    Dave: For me, it boils
    down to 3 things.

25:18.617 --> 25:19.850
    I have a formula here.

25:19.918 --> 25:24.922
    It's L plus P plus two T.

25:24.990 --> 25:27.258
    So each part is 25%.

25:27.325 --> 25:32.997
So you have 25% of the P and L,
and you have 50% of the T,

25:33.064 --> 25:36.066
    which results to what that
    person's grade would be

25:36.134 --> 25:38.936
    in terms of relationship
    and dating potential.

25:39.004 --> 25:40.037
    Now, you're wondering,

25:40.105 --> 25:41.972
L is how they look physically--

25:42.040 --> 25:44.608
    physical appearance
    and attributes.

25:44.676 --> 25:47.678
        The second--the P
        is personality.

25:47.746 --> 25:50.114
What is their lifestyle like?

25:50.181 --> 25:53.050
    And most importantly is T
    is how they treat you.

25:53.118 --> 25:54.518
    Treatment towards you.

25:54.586 --> 25:56.186
If--let's say, for example,

25:56.254 --> 25:58.422
    that the person
    is relatively ugly.

25:58.490 --> 26:02.293
Then they get, like, a 50%
category in the L category.

26:02.360 --> 26:05.429
But they have, you know,
like a perfect personality

26:05.497 --> 26:08.465
    and nearly perfect way
    they treat you,

26:08.533 --> 26:11.869
they're gonna score pretty well
in the overall scheme of things.

26:11.937 --> 26:14.405
So the T has greater weight.

26:14.472 --> 26:15.873
    It's twice as much weight
    in the formula

26:15.941 --> 26:20.010
than the personality and looks
is how they treat you.

26:20.078 --> 26:22.112
        [Playing piano]

26:25.684 --> 26:26.984
    Lindsey: You know,
    it's funny with Dave.

26:27.052 --> 26:31.956
He--he's much more scientific,
and I'm much more artistic.

26:32.023 --> 26:35.793
I think Dave is trying his best
        to understand me.

26:35.860 --> 26:39.129
    I think he always has
tried his best to understand me.

26:39.197 --> 26:42.967
    I think it's still
    difficult for him to--

26:43.034 --> 26:47.371
    to really have that grip,
    though, of understanding,

26:47.439 --> 26:50.507
    of why I have
    my particular issues.

26:50.575 --> 26:53.444
        [Playing piano]

26:59.284 --> 27:01.352
    You know, it's
    a very good question

27:01.419 --> 27:08.058
whether someone can love you
without truly understanding you.

27:09.594 --> 27:13.330
    I still think it's
    absolutely possible. Yeah.

27:15.867 --> 27:18.335
You know, obviously
we have, from time to time,

27:18.403 --> 27:22.606
talked about marriage
and, um, if we were

27:22.674 --> 27:24.942
to get married someday
and kind of

27:25.010 --> 27:27.277
some of the fears
we have with that.

27:27.345 --> 27:29.346
Um, uncertainties.

27:29.414 --> 27:31.949
        Yeah, and idea of
        whether Lindsey

27:32.017 --> 27:33.984
        would take my name
        or keep her own name.

27:34.052 --> 27:36.587
        And talk about, like,
        prenuptial agreements

27:36.655 --> 27:38.422
        and how they would
        be written out

27:38.490 --> 27:40.724
        and, uh,
        financial matters,

27:40.792 --> 27:43.827
        how they'd be, um,
        managed.

27:43.895 --> 27:45.629
        Um, things like that.

27:45.697 --> 27:46.630
Yeah.

27:46.698 --> 27:48.499
        And where the wedding
        would take place.

27:51.269 --> 27:55.239
Yeah, well, I think
that's not really fears.

27:55.306 --> 27:59.176
I think that's just
more of, you know,

27:59.244 --> 28:00.678
listing the pros
and cons

28:00.745 --> 28:04.114
and kind of--
it's the whole idea

28:04.182 --> 28:09.553
of whether marriage
is going to dictate

28:09.621 --> 28:12.956
that our identities
are lost.

28:13.024 --> 28:15.492
That's kind of
my main fear.

28:15.560 --> 28:16.593
            I'd still support

28:16.661 --> 28:17.594
            keeping
            our own identities.

28:17.662 --> 28:20.164
            I mean, marriage is
            just a--kind of like

28:20.231 --> 28:21.231
            a social title
            we would have,

28:21.299 --> 28:22.299
            but we'd still have
            our own identities.

28:22.367 --> 28:23.300
Yeah.

28:23.368 --> 28:26.336
            Of course. I would
            insist upon it.

28:27.539 --> 28:30.307
    I mean, Dave has--has been
    through a lot with me,

28:30.375 --> 28:33.811
    and he's still around,

28:33.878 --> 28:40.918
    and that to me is definitely
    evidence of--of love.

28:40.985 --> 28:43.954
Dave: I love it when she shows
me physical, um, appreciation,

28:44.022 --> 28:50.561
when she holds me, hugs me,
kisses me, smiles at me.

28:50.628 --> 28:54.031
I always love it when she comes
to tuck me into bed at night.

28:54.099 --> 28:57.401
But I feel like she puts me very
high up on her daily list.

28:57.469 --> 28:59.837
I feel like I'm very much
    important to her

28:59.904 --> 29:02.706
    and that I'm a big part
    of her life.

29:04.075 --> 29:08.145
    But the T score also
    ties in very much

29:08.213 --> 29:10.581
    to how important
    that person makes you feel.

29:10.648 --> 29:12.382
    If you don't--if you get
    the impression

29:12.450 --> 29:14.318
    that person doesn't think
    you're important,

29:14.385 --> 29:16.153
    that hurts your T score.

29:17.789 --> 29:20.023
When I was first dating her
and first meeting her,

29:20.091 --> 29:22.993
I never had stronger feelings
for anybody else ever before.

29:23.061 --> 29:25.996
The fact that they lasted for 8
years I think is a good signal

29:26.064 --> 29:29.032
    that things were on a very
    solid course here.

29:38.543 --> 29:40.244
    Man on TV: ...the winter
    we get in Memphis

29:40.311 --> 29:42.346

    been established,

        [Music playing]

30:49.514 --> 30:53.183
        Man: When Stephen
        first saw Gita,

30:53.251 --> 30:54.418
    he was introduced to her.

30:54.485 --> 30:57.788
    Stephen said,
    "I'm going to marry her."

30:57.856 --> 30:59.857
        [Laughter]

30:59.924 --> 31:03.193
And after a few days, Gita said,
    "Let's set a date."

31:03.261 --> 31:05.896
        [Laughter]

31:05.964 --> 31:09.166
    Well, the date is here,

31:09.234 --> 31:11.735
    and this is the couple,

31:11.803 --> 31:15.672
    and we hope that
    this marriage is from God.

31:15.740 --> 31:19.743
It's going to be a lasting
marriage and a happy marriage.

31:19.811 --> 31:22.546
    Stephen, voice-over:
    I met Gita 20 years ago.

31:22.614 --> 31:27.217
    It was on February 7, 1993.

31:27.285 --> 31:28.252
            Matt: What day of
            the week was that?

31:28.319 --> 31:30.120
    It was on a Sunday.

31:30.188 --> 31:31.255
            What did you say
            to her

31:31.322 --> 31:32.189
            when you first
            met her?

31:32.257 --> 31:33.590
    "Hello."

31:36.828 --> 31:38.695
        And what did you think
        when you first met her?

31:38.763 --> 31:41.031
It's nice. It was beautiful.

31:44.903 --> 31:45.836
            Are you in love
            with Gita?

31:45.904 --> 31:48.705
Yes, I'm in love with Gita.

31:48.773 --> 31:49.740
            What does that mean?

31:49.807 --> 31:51.341
I don't know.
It means to fall in love,

31:51.409 --> 31:53.744
to give a kiss
and a hug.

31:55.747 --> 31:58.015
            How do you know
            when you're in love?

31:58.082 --> 31:59.716
I don't know.

32:09.827 --> 32:13.196
        Max: Somebody suggested
        they knew of Gita.

32:13.264 --> 32:14.765
        They said, "Maybe
        these two together--

32:14.832 --> 32:15.966
        "these two will
        get together.

32:16.034 --> 32:19.703
        Maybe they'll make--
        they'll make a couple."

32:19.771 --> 32:22.406
Edith: They were kind of
complementing each other.

32:22.473 --> 32:27.344
Gita is very verbal.
That's what Stephen is lacking.

32:27.412 --> 32:30.714
Stephen has other qualities
that she was lacking,

32:30.782 --> 32:36.553
so they really
complemented each other.

32:36.621 --> 32:41.758
        Max: They lived happily
        for almost 17 years,

32:41.826 --> 32:45.329
        and then unfortunately,

32:45.396 --> 32:49.066
        Gita got ovarian cancer,

32:49.133 --> 32:52.502
        and she's fighting with
        it for the last 3 years.

32:52.570 --> 32:54.905
Remember 3 years ago,
Gita had chemo?

32:54.973 --> 32:57.140
3 years ago.

32:57.208 --> 32:58.141
        Matt: What is chemo?

32:58.209 --> 33:01.044
I don't know.
It's a disease.

33:03.014 --> 33:03.914
                Is that bad?

33:03.982 --> 33:05.515
It's bad.

33:08.753 --> 33:10.320
            So, what happened
            after chemo?

33:10.388 --> 33:11.388
I don't know.

33:11.456 --> 33:12.389
She went to the doctor.

33:12.457 --> 33:17.194
She went to the Mayo
Clinic in Rochester.

33:17.261 --> 33:18.362
            What happened there?

33:18.429 --> 33:19.563
Uh, she had to go--

33:19.630 --> 33:22.232
yeah, she had tests
for her cancer.

33:22.300 --> 33:24.101
She had tests.

33:25.870 --> 33:27.571
            And what did
            the tests say?

33:27.638 --> 33:31.174
Uh, her condition
is, uh, I don't know.

33:41.219 --> 33:43.487
Edith, voice-over:
Stephen is very hopeful

33:43.554 --> 33:46.423
about her sickness.

33:46.491 --> 33:48.425
He says, "Gita's
not gonna die.

33:48.493 --> 33:50.293
She'll be all right."

        Hi, Marlena.

34:00.905 --> 34:04.741
    I feel a little better.
    I'm getting better.

34:09.280 --> 34:10.213
    Hi, honey.

34:10.281 --> 34:11.248
                Hello.

34:11.315 --> 34:12.449
    Gita, voice-over:
    The thing with Stephen

34:12.516 --> 34:16.119
        is that he is...

34:16.187 --> 34:19.589
        I find that
        he understands me

34:19.657 --> 34:21.992
        in his own way.

34:28.733 --> 34:33.870
    I have a learn--a mild
    learning disability,

34:33.938 --> 34:40.277
    and, um--ahem--
    so but still and all,

34:40.344 --> 34:45.047
    I feel in a way that
    I can understand him

34:45.116 --> 34:49.920
    because he can--because
    we both have something

34:49.987 --> 34:53.322
    we cannot do
    and things we can do,

34:53.391 --> 34:57.694
    but being that
    we have disabilities,

34:57.762 --> 35:00.263
            we can...

35:00.331 --> 35:02.799
    we can relate all the more.

35:02.867 --> 35:05.001
Tell me what else
is new.

35:05.069 --> 35:06.103
                Nothing.

35:06.170 --> 35:11.475
Nothing? Well,
I--I relaxed all day...

35:11.542 --> 35:12.576
            That's good.

35:14.245 --> 35:16.012
            Uh-huh. That's nice.

35:16.080 --> 35:17.180
Yeah.

35:17.248 --> 35:18.982
    I don't know if this is
    the right thing to say,

35:19.050 --> 35:25.422
    but I feel bad that he's
    not able to express himself,

35:25.490 --> 35:28.692
    and I'm--and I try to
    encourage him,

35:28.759 --> 35:31.061
        to make him feel
        as if he can,

35:31.129 --> 35:32.295
    and you know something?

they look like?

35:43.875 --> 35:45.175

            like, uh--

35:45.243 --> 35:46.776
            they look like
            wash towels.

35:46.844 --> 35:48.345
                They look like
                dish towels.

35:48.412 --> 35:51.114
Oh, nice.
What colors were they?

35:51.182 --> 35:52.516
            They were purple.

Oh, nice. What's
your favorite color?

35:55.086 --> 35:56.253

    but I got used to it.

36:14.338 --> 36:16.106
    I got used to it.

36:16.174 --> 36:20.844
It's extremely difficult,
but I think if I were married

36:20.912 --> 36:27.951
    to someone who it--
    wasn't disabled

36:28.019 --> 36:31.154
    or who isn't disabled,
    I'd have more of a problem

36:31.222 --> 36:38.361

be--be--ahem--demanding

36:38.429 --> 36:42.499

            know that Stephen

36:59.884 --> 37:01.651
            is in love with you?

37:01.719 --> 37:04.254
        Gita: Um...

37:04.322 --> 37:07.891
        it's in the way
        he looks at me.

37:07.959 --> 37:10.260
        I can tell.

37:10.328 --> 37:13.430
        He gives me
        such loving eyes.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.653
    Dave: Love is a very
    abstract concept

37:36.721 --> 37:39.489
that many people with autism
have a hard time grasping,

37:39.557 --> 37:42.292
and it's one of those things
that's not concrete.

37:45.062 --> 37:47.998
As a scientist, I wish I could
put it into perspective

37:48.065 --> 37:51.134
as a type of subatomic particle,
        but it's not.

37:51.202 --> 37:54.604
    Love is basically
    more like a force.

37:57.541 --> 37:59.042
        Like, in physics,
        you have forces--

37:59.110 --> 38:01.878
    forces of attraction--
    and I have a feeling

38:01.946 --> 38:03.880
    that love is--the best way
    to describe that

38:03.948 --> 38:06.883
    is a force of attraction
    between two people

38:06.951 --> 38:12.622
    that is neither visible,
    measurable, or heard.

38:12.690 --> 38:15.258
There's no way to quantify it.

38:31.642 --> 38:35.145
    Lenny: I'm feeling a little
    down about myself right now.

38:35.212 --> 38:36.413
Matt: Why is that?

38:36.480 --> 38:37.614
    I've just been down lately.

38:37.682 --> 38:39.816
    I've been a little...

38:39.884 --> 38:43.353
    sometimes you go through
    hard times in your life.

38:46.190 --> 38:49.492
    I feel like I can't
    get a girl.

38:49.560 --> 38:52.996
    I don't--there are
    no girls at my school.

38:53.064 --> 38:54.998
    Everywhere I go,
    it's something about guys.

38:55.066 --> 38:57.934
    I go home,
    I see my stepfather,

38:58.002 --> 39:01.771
    and the only women I see
    are my good friends

39:01.839 --> 39:03.973
or my--my--my sister, like,

39:04.041 --> 39:05.442
        girls are sort of
        like my sisters

39:05.509 --> 39:09.245
    or my home girls,
    and that's so annoying.

39:09.313 --> 39:11.047
    You don't see women
    anywhere.

39:11.115 --> 39:14.084
    It's like--I feel like
    if someone came up to me

39:14.151 --> 39:17.187
and said, "Would you--would you
want to go to a women's prison

39:17.254 --> 39:20.557
    for a week?" I would
    probably say yes.

39:20.624 --> 39:23.126
    "Would you--would you go
    to a women's jail for a week

39:23.194 --> 39:24.227
    and be the only man there?"

39:24.295 --> 39:26.429
    I'd probably say yes.

39:36.507 --> 39:39.242
Lenny, voice-over: I feel like,
you know, if I had a girl,

39:39.310 --> 39:40.944
    maybe--maybe I'll be
    happy right now.

39:41.011 --> 39:43.813
    Maybe I'll be--
    feel good about myself.

39:48.452 --> 39:49.352
    You know what, Matt?

39:49.420 --> 39:50.720
        I'm gonna admit
        something to you.

39:50.788 --> 39:52.155
    Do you want me
    to tell you something?

39:52.223 --> 39:54.491
    I like girls that are black.

39:54.558 --> 39:58.027
    I like them a lot.
What do you think about that?

40:00.297 --> 40:05.068
Do you know what interracial--
interracial relationships are?

40:05.136 --> 40:08.138
    Inter--interracial
    relationships?

40:08.205 --> 40:12.575
It means when different race
people go out with each other.

40:12.643 --> 40:14.978
    I was reading something
    on the computer

40:15.045 --> 40:17.480
            that...

40:17.548 --> 40:20.650
    black women are really
    independent,

40:20.718 --> 40:22.585
    and it said that
    they're lucky girl--

40:22.653 --> 40:24.788
    that they're really
    intelligent women,

40:24.855 --> 40:28.024
and I feel like that, you know,
I want a girl like that,

40:28.092 --> 40:30.126
    but I feel like I can't.

40:31.829 --> 40:33.062
Matt: Why do you think
you can't?

40:33.130 --> 40:36.099
    Because, you know,
    they're too independent.

40:36.167 --> 40:37.967
        I need to be more
        independent.

40:38.035 --> 40:41.404
    I need to get a good job
    and make good money.

40:53.284 --> 40:54.551
    Dave, voice-over: You get
    married for love, too,

40:54.618 --> 40:57.520
but for me, there's more of
a practical component as well.

40:57.588 --> 41:01.057
    Probably 60% practical
    and 40% emotional.

41:01.125 --> 41:03.593
    I'll always love her.
    That won't change.

41:03.661 --> 41:06.396
    But for the specific
    reasons for the marriage,

41:06.464 --> 41:08.998
that's what it'd boil down to.

41:12.303 --> 41:17.040
    Lindsey, voice-over:
I had told him a few years ago

41:17.107 --> 41:19.642
    that whenever he was ready
    to take that next step,

41:19.710 --> 41:25.281
    that I would be
    willing to--to accept.

41:27.218 --> 41:33.857
    I've--I've yet to hear
    any kind of indicator

41:33.924 --> 41:36.326
    that that next step
    may be taken.

42:09.093 --> 42:11.928
        Um, I know that we kind
        of brushed over this,

42:11.996 --> 42:14.030
        like, when we chatted
        about it.

42:14.098 --> 42:16.132
        I do believe you
        and trust you

42:16.200 --> 42:18.034
        when--when you've
        told me that

42:18.102 --> 42:19.302
        you were in it
        for the long haul.

42:19.370 --> 42:20.403
Oh, yeah.

42:20.471 --> 42:22.238
        And I do believe you,
        and I do--you know,

42:22.306 --> 42:26.075
        I do trust you,
        and I--I, um, you know,

42:26.143 --> 42:28.044
        I definitely am in it
        for the long haul

42:28.112 --> 42:30.513
        for us, too, and I--
        I wouldn't--you know,

42:30.581 --> 42:33.616
        I wouldn't be here
        if I wasn't.

42:33.684 --> 42:34.617
Well, I know that.

42:34.685 --> 42:36.152
                Yeah.

42:43.460 --> 42:45.828
        I guess I'm just--
        I was just still

42:45.896 --> 42:48.364
        kind of just figuring
        out, like--

42:48.432 --> 42:49.432
That was a conversation
that made me

42:49.500 --> 42:51.401
a little bit
uncomfortable, too.

42:55.172 --> 42:56.105
            Oh, you mean
            at the time?

42:56.173 --> 42:57.006
Yeah, yeah.

42:57.074 --> 42:58.841
        Yeah. Well, it's
        uncomfortable

42:58.909 --> 43:01.811
        for me, too, but...

43:01.879 --> 43:03.713
        it's important.

43:03.781 --> 43:06.416
        It's important.
        Sometimes I think

43:06.483 --> 43:08.851
        there's conversations
        that are uncomfortable

43:08.919 --> 43:12.055
        for us, but they're
        really important

43:12.122 --> 43:18.127
        to have or at least
        to address them

43:18.195 --> 43:20.964
        in order to us
        to understand

43:21.031 --> 43:24.167
        where each other
        are coming from.

43:24.234 --> 43:27.604
        So I--I'm not gonna lie.
        So...

43:27.671 --> 43:29.939
But having this on camera,
I don't like at all.

43:30.007 --> 43:31.174
I don't like the idea
of having this conversation

43:31.241 --> 43:32.775
on camera at all.

43:32.843 --> 43:34.410
                OK.

43:34.478 --> 43:36.546
It's one of those things
that's best left

43:36.614 --> 43:38.381
off camera, I think.

43:38.449 --> 43:39.749
            OK. We can stop
            talking about it.

43:39.817 --> 43:41.284
Yes.

43:42.186 --> 43:43.119
            All right.
            Thank you for--

43:43.187 --> 43:44.220
            thank you for
            letting me know.

43:44.288 --> 43:45.855
I think--yeah, I just
feel better that way.

43:45.923 --> 43:46.856
                    OK.

43:46.924 --> 43:47.857
I just feel
uncomfortable

43:47.925 --> 43:48.992
being on camera
talking about it.

43:49.059 --> 43:49.993
            All right.
            No, thank you

43:50.060 --> 43:51.427
            for letting me know.

43:55.599 --> 43:56.432
But you know how
I feel,

43:56.500 --> 43:58.835
so don't worry
about it.

44:10.581 --> 44:11.914
    Lindsey, voice-over:
    There's been times

44:11.982 --> 44:18.321
that I have questioned whether
he really wants to be with me.

44:20.791 --> 44:23.493
Gordon: Within yourself,
you think you can communicate.

44:23.560 --> 44:24.794
        You think you've
        said something.

44:24.862 --> 44:26.262
    You think it should be
    obvious to somebody

44:26.330 --> 44:28.297
that's this, this, and this,

44:28.365 --> 44:31.768
    but again you go back
    to the antenna.

44:31.835 --> 44:34.537
Maybe you are, but maybe
they haven't picked that up.

44:54.958 --> 44:58.461
Stephen, voice-over: Yes,
this is my apartment with Gita.

45:01.131 --> 45:03.399
    Uh, this is our bedroom.

45:07.171 --> 45:09.138
    It's beautiful, isn't it?

45:09.206 --> 45:13.676
Gita moved here with me, uh--
    that was 15 years ago.

45:13.744 --> 45:17.814
        [Door closes]

45:17.881 --> 45:20.283
    And this is our bathroom.

45:22.953 --> 45:26.889
Stephen, voice-over: She moved--
she had to go--she had surgery

45:26.957 --> 45:29.225
        on--in May 2010.

45:31.195 --> 45:32.895
    That was 3 years ago.

45:49.213 --> 45:52.081
Stephen, voice-over: I'll take
a shower tonight at 7:00.

45:52.149 --> 45:55.485
Edith: OK, maybe at 7:30
if you go later to Gita's.

45:55.552 --> 45:58.488
        I'll go--I'll go see
        Gita right now.

45:58.555 --> 46:00.289
I think they're
eating, still.

46:00.357 --> 46:01.290
        They're eating--no,

46:01.358 --> 46:02.258
        they're
        still eating dinner.

46:02.326 --> 46:03.426
        They're eating dinner.

46:03.494 --> 46:07.130
Yeah, because Erica
was making it late...

46:07.197 --> 46:08.097
                Yes.

46:08.165 --> 46:10.566
because Gita wasn't
feeling well.

46:10.634 --> 46:12.935
        I hope Gita
        will feel better.

46:13.003 --> 46:14.737
I hope so.

46:21.612 --> 46:23.179
She threw up.

46:23.247 --> 46:24.680
            She felt nauseous.

46:24.748 --> 46:27.850
Yeah. Did she
tell you that?

46:27.918 --> 46:29.752
            Yeah, she told
            me that.

46:29.820 --> 46:30.820
When you were there?

46:30.888 --> 46:32.255
                Yes.

46:46.370 --> 46:49.839
     I'm trying--I'm trying
     to be positive, man.

46:49.841 --> 46:51.174
           I'm just--

46:51.176 --> 46:53.075
   it's been kind of hard
   the past couple of weeks.

46:53.077 --> 46:56.846
      Last week I did
      something to a girl,

46:56.848 --> 46:58.214
      and it wasn't right.

46:58.216 --> 47:02.385
  It felt--it felt
  kind of stupid, what I did.

47:02.619 --> 47:07.423
  I was bored. I wanted to see
  what women felt like.

47:07.425 --> 47:10.526
 It felt good for a little bit.

47:10.528 --> 47:13.863
  Maybe for, like, 20 minutes
  it felt good, but it just

47:13.865 --> 47:15.364
        felt like you--
        two things.

47:15.366 --> 47:18.301
    It felt like you wanted
    to do it more times,

47:18.303 --> 47:20.203
     but it just felt like
     whatever at the end

47:20.205 --> 47:21.938
       because it just--
       that wasn't--

47:21.940 --> 47:23.873
    I don't--
    I don't know that girl.

47:23.875 --> 47:25.308
       I don't--
       I don't love her.

47:25.310 --> 47:27.510
         I just--
         it felt like,

47:27.512 --> 47:30.546
     I kind of felt bad for
     her a little bit.

47:30.548 --> 47:35.518
   People told me that--
   I talked to 2 or 3 people.

47:35.520 --> 47:38.154
      [Whispers] I kind of
      want to say it

47:38.156 --> 47:39.455
    when there aren't
    that many people around.

47:39.457 --> 47:41.757
I kind of want to say it softly
because it isn't good.

47:41.759 --> 47:44.393
  People tell me that, "Oh"--

47:44.395 --> 47:46.262
    p-people, they tell me,
    "Oh, you got ripped off

47:46.264 --> 47:47.663
  for just touching her ass."

47:47.665 --> 47:50.299
   People told me that "you
   could have gotten a ha--"

47:50.301 --> 47:53.469
    People told me that I
    could have gotten a ---.

47:53.471 --> 47:55.104
     People--you know
     what this stuff means?

47:55.106 --> 47:57.273
   People told me that
   I could have gotten a ---.

47:57.275 --> 47:59.242
     People told me that I
     could have gotten--

47:59.244 --> 48:01.210
        could have ---.

48:01.212 --> 48:06.282
      People told me that
      I could have...

48:06.284 --> 48:09.085
          had --- her.

48:09.087 --> 48:11.320
  That's what people told me--

48:11.322 --> 48:13.522
        those 4 things,
        People told me

48:13.524 --> 48:16.425
  people told me that I could
  have done those 4 things

48:16.427 --> 48:19.328
   with--with the 20 bucks,
   that "you got ripped off"

48:19.330 --> 48:22.098
    and "delete her number."

48:22.100 --> 48:24.800
     She told me
     her name was Diamond.

48:24.802 --> 48:28.704
   That--that doesn't sound
   like a real name, does it?

48:41.652 --> 48:43.419
Dave, voice-over: I've been
together with her for 8 years,

48:43.421 --> 48:44.587
    and a lot of people
    are wondering,

48:44.589 --> 48:47.056
"Why are you still
just boyfriend/girlfriend?"

48:47.058 --> 48:48.057
A lot of people are asking,

48:48.059 --> 48:49.558
    "When are y'all
    gonna get married?"

48:49.560 --> 48:53.629
That's, um--that's always a big
step for a guy to take,

48:53.631 --> 48:57.466
    and got to make sure
    it's the right one.

49:28.398 --> 49:30.866
    When we talked about it,
    she made me feel like,

49:30.868 --> 49:32.401
"Oh, I do want to marry you,

49:32.403 --> 49:34.971
    but maybe now's
    not the right time."

49:34.973 --> 49:36.005
    That's--it's not likely,

49:36.007 --> 49:38.374
    but it's possible
    she might say that.

49:38.376 --> 49:43.846
Uh, I--sometimes what she thinks
is different from what I think,

49:43.848 --> 49:45.114
            so...

49:45.116 --> 49:50.086
    Lindsey, voice-over:
    I think before I said yes,

49:50.088 --> 49:53.756
    I'd want to ask him...

49:53.758 --> 49:58.227
    what in particular
    had been holding him back

49:58.229 --> 50:00.830
    the past few years,

50:00.832 --> 50:04.166
    since when I first
    brought it up.

50:06.436 --> 50:10.106
Gordon: Nobody was exactly at
the same place at the same time.

50:10.108 --> 50:12.808
I hope, for her sake, that--
that they will eventually

50:12.810 --> 50:16.412
    make a--a firm and formal
    commitment to each other.

50:16.414 --> 50:18.781
    OK, maybe it's just
    a few simple words

50:18.783 --> 50:19.849
    or something like that.

50:19.851 --> 50:21.484
    Maybe it's just a little
    formal ceremony,

50:21.486 --> 50:23.386
    something like that,
    but it means something.

50:23.388 --> 50:24.687
    It makes a difference.

50:24.689 --> 50:28.557
It--it gives a base for someone
to feel self-confident

50:28.559 --> 50:33.529
about giving everything of
themselves to the other person

50:33.531 --> 50:37.833
    without restraint
    or without holding back.

50:39.002 --> 50:41.537
But I think that's just one
    of the challenges

50:41.539 --> 50:45.174
        that they've had
        to work through.

        [Indistinct]

50:55.519 --> 50:57.853
        So do you still, um,
        continue to think

50:57.855 --> 50:59.889
        about the future?

51:00.290 --> 51:04.126
        Like next steps
        and stuff like that.

51:04.128 --> 51:07.830
Well, I--I thought
we had that conversation

51:07.832 --> 51:11.333
recently about how
I wasn't reading your mind

51:11.335 --> 51:12.568
and I wasn't sure.
                    Yeah.

51:12.570 --> 51:15.404
And then you--you
reassured me

51:15.406 --> 51:18.974
that, um, you...

51:18.976 --> 51:22.378
that I--I shouldn't
be worried about anything.

51:22.380 --> 51:25.614

51:25.616 --> 51:26.615
            everything is still
            the case.

51:26.617 --> 51:29.819
            Is that still
            the same thing?

51:34.458 --> 51:35.424
            You wouldn't be
            hesitant

51:35.426 --> 51:38.227
            to the idea of
            marriage, would you?

51:40.964 --> 51:43.165
I don't think you've
ever been so candid

51:43.167 --> 51:45.835
about this
conversation before.

51:45.837 --> 51:47.670
I guess you've been
thinking about it.

51:47.672 --> 51:48.537

honest with you.

I'm always going to be

51:57.949 --> 52:01.951

that involves, um,

52:01.953 --> 52:03.419

                Right.

52:04.422 --> 52:07.389
Right? And marriage
is one of them.

52:07.391 --> 52:08.524
            Is what? I'm sorry.

52:08.526 --> 52:09.825

one of them.

is, do we feel happy?

    I'll call you stupid.

Let me tell you something, Matt.

53:08.385 --> 53:10.019

    a tear come out of your eye.

        about me crying?

57:14.497 --> 57:18.100
I got no job. I got no car.

57:18.168 --> 57:21.470

57:21.538 --> 57:23.972
I should be doing something.

I'm a good person, man.
I'm not a bad person, Matt.

57:36.119 --> 57:39.488
        I'm a good guy.
        That's just--

57:41.057 --> 57:44.092
    It hurts. It hurts, man.

57:50.233 --> 57:53.202
    He once told me that...

57:53.269 --> 58:00.509
    that, um--he said, "You ever
    walk into a room...

58:00.577 --> 58:02.644
    and you know everybody's
    talking about you?"

58:02.712 --> 58:04.346
    And he said that's how
    he feels every day

58:04.414 --> 58:06.782
    when he leaves
    the house, you know?

58:06.850 --> 58:08.684
            So, um...

58:10.053 --> 58:12.254
    I just want my son
    to be happy.

58:15.291 --> 58:18.427
    And, um, I think he needs
    to come to terms

58:18.495 --> 58:20.996
        with who he is

58:21.064 --> 58:25.334
    because he's not comfortable
    with who he is,

58:25.401 --> 58:26.835
    and if he's not
    comfortable with who he is,

58:26.903 --> 58:29.738
    I don't know how he could
    ever expect anybody else

58:29.806 --> 58:32.140
        to be comfortable
        with who he is.

58:59.035 --> 59:01.136
    Stephen, voice-over:
    I feel sad about Gita.

59:01.204 --> 59:03.205
    She died last April.

59:05.208 --> 59:07.876
    She had cancer. That's sad.

59:13.883 --> 59:17.052
    She was laying down.
    She was laid to rest.

59:21.758 --> 59:24.459
    I miss Gita. I miss Gita.

59:27.063 --> 59:28.730
When Gita died, we went

59:28.798 --> 59:32.601
to the--to work
to tell him.

59:32.669 --> 59:36.305
It was on a workday,
and he was there,

59:36.372 --> 59:38.607
and when I told him,

59:38.675 --> 59:41.643
he just turned white
like a sheet.

59:44.180 --> 59:46.682
He put his head
down on the table.

59:46.749 --> 59:50.285
I could tell
he was very upset.

59:51.154 --> 59:53.088
She was gone.

59:55.458 --> 59:56.358
Matt: Do you feel like

59:56.426 --> 59:58.126
you're still
in love with Gita?

59:58.194 --> 01:00:00.395
    No. I stop loving
    someone--they die,

01:00:00.463 --> 01:00:01.396
        because they die,

01:00:01.464 --> 01:00:04.533
        because Gita died
        on April 9.

01:00:05.835 --> 01:00:07.703
    No longer in love.

01:00:26.389 --> 01:00:28.123
        Max: It is a big help
        for him to go back--

01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:30.258
        go back to work.

01:00:32.929 --> 01:00:36.064
Edith: We encouraged
him to pick up life

01:00:36.132 --> 01:00:38.433
like...

01:00:38.501 --> 01:00:41.003
normal, sort of.

01:00:44.173 --> 01:00:45.340
    Stephen, voice-over:
    I fell in love with Gita

01:00:45.408 --> 01:00:47.743
    for the past 20 years.

01:00:50.013 --> 01:00:52.481
    And then gave--I gave
    Gita a hug.

01:00:52.548 --> 01:00:56.151
    I gave Gita a hug.

01:00:56.219 --> 01:01:00.155
I--I put my arms around her.

01:01:11.601 --> 01:01:13.602
    Dave: In physics, we have
    something called

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:14.870
    electromagnetic spectrum--

01:01:14.937 --> 01:01:16.405
        how much energy
        a wavelength has.

01:01:16.472 --> 01:01:18.373
You go from radio waves to light

01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:20.876
    to ultraviolet,
    x-rays, gamma rays.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.414
    And then how I feel
    towards someone

01:01:25.481 --> 01:01:26.715
is kind of on a similar scale.

01:01:26.783 --> 01:01:30.819
You have different wavelengths

01:01:30.887 --> 01:01:33.455
going from just physical lust,

01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:35.023
    then you go--graduate from

01:01:35.091 --> 01:01:37.192
    a general interest
    in the opposite sex.

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:40.162
Then you graduate from having
a specific intense crush

01:01:40.229 --> 01:01:42.631
    on a specific person.

01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:48.036
    Dave: And after that,
    it kind of evolves into

01:01:48.104 --> 01:01:50.539
    another stage, which is
    the true love stage

01:01:50.606 --> 01:01:54.976
and not having that deep crush
where you're thinking about her

01:01:55.044 --> 01:01:56.378
    24/7 and you have
    a hard time sleeping

01:01:56.446 --> 01:01:58.013
    because you're so much
    in love with her,

01:01:58.081 --> 01:02:01.083
but it kind of graduates
into a more subconscious form.

01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:02.451
    Let's say you're going
    from light waves

01:02:02.518 --> 01:02:04.586
that you can basically see
to ultraviolet waves.

01:02:04.654 --> 01:02:06.555
    They're still there,
    but you can't see them.

01:02:06.622 --> 01:02:09.257
    But they're stronger.
    Is that making sense?

01:02:18.367 --> 01:02:19.334
Lindsey: Are you sure
that was--

01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:20.535
are you sure that was
the spot

01:02:20.603 --> 01:02:22.104
where we did
that photograph?

01:02:22.171 --> 01:02:23.105
            I want to say
            it was taken

01:02:23.172 --> 01:02:24.706
            somewhere
            around here.

01:02:32.915 --> 01:02:35.584
            Very--this is
            nostalgic, isn't it?

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.654
            Almost 8 years ago.

01:02:40.957 --> 01:02:43.592
            It's always amazing
            when you look back

01:02:43.659 --> 01:02:47.496
            in time, how things
            have grown and how

01:02:47.563 --> 01:02:49.531
            our relationship
            has grown

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:51.600
            and what we've
            been through

01:02:51.667 --> 01:02:53.869
            has been really
            amazing.

01:02:53.936 --> 01:02:55.403
            That says something
            when you go

01:02:55.471 --> 01:02:57.339
            for a relationship
            that long,

01:02:57.406 --> 01:03:00.475
            that is a very
            strong signal

01:03:00.543 --> 01:03:02.377
        that the relationship
        is meant to be.

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:05.213
        And at first, um, you
        were kind of confused

01:03:05.281 --> 01:03:07.048
        as to where
        we were headed,

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:08.784
        and I remember
        you telling me

01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:11.286
        you were--you would
        have been totally happy

01:03:11.354 --> 01:03:12.320
            just pursuing
            your career

01:03:12.388 --> 01:03:13.989
            and being a single
            woman,

01:03:14.056 --> 01:03:14.990
            and then...

01:03:15.057 --> 01:03:17.125
Remember that slide
you kind of show

01:03:17.193 --> 01:03:18.994
on your presentation--

01:03:19.061 --> 01:03:20.629
is it the
physics-related slide?

01:03:20.696 --> 01:03:21.963
            Yes. Yes.

01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:23.098
Where you have...

01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:24.099
            the wavelengths.

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:26.401
The alpha and the beta
and the gamma?

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:27.402
            And the delta.

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:29.171
The delta.

01:03:29.238 --> 01:03:34.176
And I think how I
viewed our experience

01:03:34.243 --> 01:03:37.946
and our adventure
together

01:03:38.014 --> 01:03:41.616
is that our wavelengths
might have been different

01:03:41.684 --> 01:03:43.018
at different times--

01:03:43.085 --> 01:03:44.853
        It was a mutual thing.

01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:47.656
And I think

01:03:47.723 --> 01:03:49.191
having those different
wavelengths

01:03:49.258 --> 01:03:52.227
at different times
may have been

01:03:52.295 --> 01:03:55.263
a significant
reason why

01:03:55.331 --> 01:03:59.034
we both may have
struggled

01:03:59.101 --> 01:04:01.436
to...

01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:07.442
really understand where
we may be seeing ourselves

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:08.677
in the far future.

01:04:08.744 --> 01:04:09.678
        But now I feel like

01:04:09.745 --> 01:04:11.546
        our wavelengths
        are in sync.

01:04:12.348 --> 01:04:14.716
I feel like
we've grown.

01:04:14.784 --> 01:04:16.184
                We have.

01:04:16.252 --> 01:04:20.555
And I want to
only go

01:04:20.623 --> 01:04:22.324
by what's in here...

01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:24.459
            Absolutely.
            In here, too.

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:25.827
and what's in here.

01:04:25.895 --> 01:04:28.063
            And trust me,
            it's in here.

01:04:29.332 --> 01:04:30.966
            It's in here

01:04:31.033 --> 01:04:33.268
            and always will be.

01:04:33.336 --> 01:04:34.269
            And I say that

01:04:34.337 --> 01:04:36.504
            from the bottom
            of my heart.

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.247
            [Sigh]

01:04:45.314 --> 01:04:47.649
[Laughs and cries]

01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:51.152
            And it's OK to blush
            if you want to,

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:56.491
            but, um, understand
            if you do.

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:58.493
            But, uh, this has
            been a remarkable

01:04:58.561 --> 01:05:03.765
        journey, and somebody
        as beautiful as you

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:05.867
        deserves the very best

01:05:05.935 --> 01:05:08.370
        and a life of happiness
        together.

01:05:08.437 --> 01:05:14.509
        And I would very much
        be honored...

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:16.912
        to have you as my wife.

01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:22.584
        Will you marry me?

01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:40.635
Yes, I will marry you.

01:05:49.712 --> 01:05:51.179
            There you are.

01:05:56.619 --> 01:05:57.686
            That's why I wore
            my vest--

01:05:57.753 --> 01:05:59.487
            to conceal that.

01:05:59.555 --> 01:06:03.458
I--I was wondering
about that.

01:06:06.329 --> 01:06:08.196
            But definitely
            in the delta region

01:06:08.264 --> 01:06:09.998
        where it's true love.

01:06:10.066 --> 01:06:12.767
        That's the wavelength
        we're both in.

01:06:24.413 --> 01:06:28.650
        "Your task is not
        to seek for love

01:06:28.718 --> 01:06:32.220
    "but merely to seek
    and find all the barriers

01:06:32.288 --> 01:06:36.891
    within yourself that
    you have built against it."

01:06:36.959 --> 01:06:39.961
    That quote really
    resonates with my life.

01:06:41.497 --> 01:06:47.969
    All the negative things
    that I heard on autism

01:06:48.037 --> 01:06:54.509
growing up, it definitely made
me feel worthless or less.

01:06:57.213 --> 01:07:01.649
    I had consistently
    set up barriers

01:07:01.717 --> 01:07:04.119
    to protect myself.

01:07:04.186 --> 01:07:11.192
It's very easy to not feel like
that you can trust people.

01:07:18.901 --> 01:07:23.271
    I thought that perhaps

01:07:23.339 --> 01:07:28.443
    Dave was holding back
    more than I was.

01:07:28.511 --> 01:07:34.582
    But what I discovered
through a lot of introspection

01:07:34.650 --> 01:07:39.421
    is that I was really
    holding back, too.

01:07:58.374 --> 01:08:00.375

    contest--

01:08:03.179 --> 01:08:04.846
Who was Arthur C. Clarke?

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:06.347
        Alex: ...2001? Lars.

01:08:06.415 --> 01:08:07.348
    Lars: Who is Clarke?

01:08:07.416 --> 01:08:09.417
    Alex: Arthur C. Clarke.
    You are right.

01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:11.653

    Security Administration...

    Lenny: I'm gonna throw
    a penny in the water,

01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:20.862
        make a wish.

01:08:24.332 --> 01:08:26.468
    When I make my wishes,
    I make it clear

01:08:26.535 --> 01:08:29.703
that I don't tell anybody, OK?

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:31.005
Hey, by the way, there's
some more ducks over there.

01:08:31.073 --> 01:08:33.575
    Why don't you go
    film them all over there?

01:08:49.091 --> 01:08:51.192
    Lenny: Got one minute
    left, by the way.

01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:53.495
    When that one minute's
    over with, I'm gone.

01:08:53.562 --> 01:08:56.865
    I got to go back.
    I like to get there early.

01:08:57.966 --> 01:09:00.568
        I don't know.
    It's kind of fun doing this.

01:09:03.238 --> 01:09:06.006
        6 weeks I've been
        working here at Flora.

01:09:06.075 --> 01:09:09.410
    Here. Here's your--here's
    the one right here.

01:09:11.447 --> 01:09:13.680
    A famous person that had
    a job like this

01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:14.749
    when he was a young man
    was Kurt Warner.

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:15.783
    You don't know who
    Kurt Warner is?

01:09:15.850 --> 01:09:17.318
    He's the--he's
    the football player--

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:21.356
he's the quarterback who played
for the Rams a long time ago.

01:09:21.423 --> 01:09:23.024
    You don't remember how
    that Super Bowl happened

01:09:23.091 --> 01:09:24.959
    where it was the last
    second on--

01:09:25.027 --> 01:09:27.328
    they were one yard
    short of winning it?

01:09:27.395 --> 01:09:29.397
    Well, he was the quarterback
    of that winning game.

01:09:29.465 --> 01:09:31.966
    All right. I got
    to go back now. Sorry.

01:09:32.968 --> 01:09:34.736
        Got to go.

01:09:34.803 --> 01:09:36.871
    Sorry. Got to go back now.

01:09:39.707 --> 01:09:43.511
    I'm back now. May I have
    a drink of water, please?

01:09:46.448 --> 01:09:47.881
                    OK, ready?
            OK.

01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:48.883

01:09:52.453 --> 01:09:53.388
                    Ready?

01:09:53.455 --> 01:09:54.389
