like, this past year?

25:17.383 --> 25:19.116
Was it, like,
the best year of your life?

25:19.118 --> 25:21.886
Was it terrible?

25:25.857 --> 25:27.937
What was terrible
about this past year?

25:30.395 --> 25:31.428
[laughs]

25:37.135 --> 25:39.236
<i>[Janice] Walking into
Biniyam's apartment,</i>

25:39.238 --> 25:41.005
I'm having chest pain.

25:41.007 --> 25:42.606
[Biniyam speaking]

25:42.608 --> 25:44.608
- [Janice] This is the kitchen?
- [Biniyam] Yeah.

25:44.610 --> 25:46.143
Where's the refrigerator?

25:50.048 --> 25:51.582
No refrigerator?

25:51.584 --> 25:56.120
For me to accept Ari here
is very difficult.

25:56.122 --> 25:57.888
[Biniyam speaking]

25:59.791 --> 26:01.692
[Ariela] You're [bleep]
excited for this baby

26:01.694 --> 26:04.295
but how are we gonna
actually take care of it?

26:04.297 --> 26:06.497
I can't live in a place
that has no bathroom

26:06.499 --> 26:07.565
and no kitchen.

26:09.367 --> 26:10.935
I'm not [bleep] staying here.

26:10.937 --> 26:12.336
I told you that.

26:17.342 --> 26:18.943
It seems odd to me
that you would describe

26:18.945 --> 26:20.911
the past year
when your son was born

26:20.913 --> 26:22.833
and you got engaged as terrible.

26:25.717 --> 26:28.752
[upbeat music playing]

26:28.754 --> 26:30.187
[Ariela] Are you happy now

26:30.189 --> 26:32.149
that you have
a whole new family?

26:36.328 --> 26:39.330
[crowd cheering]

26:41.099 --> 26:42.299
Oh, my God.

26:46.104 --> 26:47.471
Yes, I'll marry you.

26:47.473 --> 26:49.406
[Biniyam] Thank you.

26:49.408 --> 26:52.443
[crowd cheering]

27:01.386 --> 27:03.426
That's life.
Life is like that always.

27:04.289 --> 27:07.291
[playful music playing]

27:08.627 --> 27:10.527
- [Ariela] Uh, Mimi?
- [Mimi speaking]

27:10.529 --> 27:12.529
[Ariela] Can you... Avi,
he's asleep, my Avi.

27:12.531 --> 27:14.031
Yeah, he's asleep.

27:14.033 --> 27:15.899
- Yeah. Can you take that?
- [Mimi] Yeah.

27:15.901 --> 27:18.168
[Mimi speaking]

27:18.170 --> 27:20.170
<i>[Ariela] Since Bini proposed,
we moved into</i>

27:20.172 --> 27:22.139
<i>a three-bedroom house together</i>

27:22.141 --> 27:25.242
<i>and Bini suggested hiring
a live-in-nanny.</i>

27:25.244 --> 27:27.177
In Ethiopia, it's very common

27:27.179 --> 27:29.380
for people to have live in help.

27:29.382 --> 27:31.649
<i>Child care in Ethiopia
is much cheaper</i>

27:31.651 --> 27:32.850
<i>than it is in the States.</i>

27:32.852 --> 27:35.185
<i>It's only $200 a month,</i>

27:35.187 --> 27:37.554
but it's been
really hard for Bini

27:37.556 --> 27:39.857
<i>because there's,
like, almost no work.</i>

27:39.859 --> 27:42.693
<i>So my parents
have been helping us.</i>

27:42.695 --> 27:44.561
So are you getting back
in shape? Are you gonna get

27:44.563 --> 27:46.730
- a dad bod and everything?
- [Biniyam] Yeah.

27:51.870 --> 27:54.204
[Biniyam speaking

28:16.661 --> 28:17.695
[Ariela] Chubby?

28:24.436 --> 28:25.636
[Ariela] Love you, too.

28:32.577 --> 28:35.579
[upbeat music playing]

28:46.124 --> 28:48.025
- [Ariela] Hi.
- [Mimi speaking]

28:51.096 --> 28:54.465
- [Ariela] Yeah.
- [Mimi speaking]

28:54.467 --> 28:57.835
I know. Everything I have to
make just like you.

28:57.837 --> 28:59.670
[Ariela] Okay.
Let's see.

28:59.672 --> 29:01.772
[Mimi speaking]

29:01.774 --> 29:03.540
- Oh, from outside. Okay.
- [Mimi speaking]

29:03.542 --> 29:05.976
- [Ariela] Oh, my God.
- [Mimi speaking]

29:05.978 --> 29:08.679
- [Ariela speaking]
- [Mimi] Get...

29:08.681 --> 29:10.981
-I screwed up
-[Mimi speaking]

29:10.983 --> 29:13.383
<i>[Ariela] Having Mimi around
has really helped me.</i>

29:13.385 --> 29:15.486
<i>She helps me understand</i>

29:15.488 --> 29:18.455
Ethiopian culture
and Ethiopian life.

29:18.457 --> 29:20.457
She helps me to learn Amharic.

29:20.459 --> 29:22.626
She teaches me
Ethiopian cooking.

29:22.628 --> 29:25.963
<i>I can't imagine my life
without her now.</i>

29:25.965 --> 29:28.098
I know I tell you all the time
but I just wanna tell you,

29:28.100 --> 29:30.300
like, you know,
you're my best friend.

29:30.302 --> 29:31.635
Like, you've become really...

29:31.637 --> 29:33.170
You're, like, my family,
you know?

29:33.172 --> 29:34.972
- [Mimi speaking]
- [Ariela] You helped a lot

29:34.974 --> 29:37.374
because so many times, like,
when Bini, he goes out

29:37.376 --> 29:39.009
and he stays out all night,
you know,

29:39.011 --> 29:40.677
- and I would be alone...
- [Mimi] Yeah, it is...

29:40.679 --> 29:42.279
with the baby,
it's very hard.

29:42.281 --> 29:45.182
[Mimi speaking]

29:45.184 --> 29:47.985
[dramatic music playing]

29:47.987 --> 29:50.187
<i>[Ariela] Bini's not
working at the club</i>

29:50.189 --> 29:52.089
but he still sometimes
goes to the studio

29:52.091 --> 29:54.391
and works on his music,
he sees his friends,

29:54.393 --> 29:57.294
<i>and then he'll, like,
be out all night.</i>

29:57.296 --> 30:00.030
<i>You know, it can be isolating
because I don't have</i>

30:00.032 --> 30:01.932
a set group of friends
or that...

30:01.934 --> 30:03.333
Like, I don't have, like,

30:03.335 --> 30:05.502
deep relationships
with people here.

30:09.007 --> 30:11.942
- Yeah. For the most part
I'm happy.
- [Mimi] Yeah.

30:11.944 --> 30:14.511
[Ariela] But, you know,
the one thing
I'm really happy about though

30:14.513 --> 30:17.447
- is my ex-husband,
Leander, he's gonna...
- [Mimi speaking]

30:17.449 --> 30:18.816
[Ariela] Of course I miss him.

30:18.818 --> 30:20.083
He's my best friend.

30:22.687 --> 30:24.955
<i>Because I'm feeling
a little bit homesick,</i>

30:24.957 --> 30:27.858
I asked Leander to come visit
to see the new baby

30:27.860 --> 30:29.900
and to meet Bini,
to see my life here.

30:31.329 --> 30:33.964
<i>Leandro and I
are still best friends</i>

30:33.966 --> 30:35.833
<i>even though we got a divorce.</i>

30:35.835 --> 30:37.334
We talk all the time

30:37.336 --> 30:40.637
and he is really involved
in my life.

30:40.639 --> 30:43.607
Do you think it's weird
that my ex-husband is coming?

30:43.609 --> 30:45.309
Like, an Ethiopian woman,
would they ever have

30:45.311 --> 30:47.471
- the ex-husband visit them?
- [Mimi speaking]

30:58.456 --> 31:00.416
[Mimi speaking
in foreign language]

31:13.605 --> 31:15.005
[Ariela]
We're very good friends.

31:15.007 --> 31:17.174
Let's see what Bini thinks.

31:17.176 --> 31:18.508
[Mimi speaking]

31:18.510 --> 31:22.179
[dramatic music playing]

31:22.181 --> 31:24.114
[Ariela] I definitely don't
think that it's normal

31:24.116 --> 31:26.583
in Ethiopia to be close
with your ex-husband

31:26.585 --> 31:28.218
or your ex-wife,

31:28.220 --> 31:31.355
but because Leandro's
always gonna be my life,

31:31.357 --> 31:33.423
I think it's really important
that Bini and Leandro

31:33.425 --> 31:35.626
meet each other
and accept each other.

31:35.628 --> 31:38.095
<i>But I think Bini feels
a little bit macho</i>

31:38.097 --> 31:39.796
<i>and territorial about me,</i>

31:39.798 --> 31:41.565
so I'm not sure if
they're gonna get along.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.901
You know, Bini
is very jealous when,

31:43.903 --> 31:45.235
like, I talk to him
on the phone.

31:45.237 --> 31:46.570
I'm not sure how
he's gonna react

31:46.572 --> 31:48.405
having him face to face.

32:01.052 --> 32:02.920
[Jenny] Sumit has faith
that the astrologer

32:02.922 --> 32:04.821
would tell us our future.

32:04.823 --> 32:08.191
[Sumit speaking]

32:08.193 --> 32:10.928
<i>[Jenny] Whatever that</i>
<i>astrologer says,</i>
<i>I don't care.</i>

33:10.856 --> 33:14.624
Oh my God,
those are so beautiful.

33:14.626 --> 33:16.960
- [Sumit speaking]
- Thank you, baby.

33:16.962 --> 33:19.396
<i>It's been maybe ten years</i>

33:19.398 --> 33:22.099
and our relationship
has faced a lot of obstacles,

33:22.101 --> 33:23.700
a lot of challenges

33:23.702 --> 33:26.703
probably more than anyone
else's in the world.

33:26.705 --> 33:28.472
[Sumit speaking]

33:30.875 --> 33:32.442
Okay.

33:32.444 --> 33:34.778
<i>I met Sumit ten years ago online</i>

33:34.780 --> 33:38.115
but he wasn't
who I thought he was.

33:38.117 --> 33:39.683
He was actually

33:39.685 --> 33:42.486
catfishing me
from the beginning,

33:42.488 --> 33:44.321
unfortunately.

33:47.325 --> 33:50.394
[Sumit speaking]

34:05.910 --> 34:07.790
He used the name Michael Jones.

34:09.914 --> 34:11.715
[Sumit speaking]

34:17.622 --> 34:18.922
I was upset at first,

34:18.924 --> 34:21.625
but when I finally
got to see his face,

34:25.329 --> 34:27.297
<i>I said, oh, he's so cute.</i>

34:27.299 --> 34:31.268
Cuter than the guy
he was pretending to be.

34:31.270 --> 34:33.437
Oh God.

34:33.439 --> 34:35.439
Oh my God.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.679
This is gonna clash
with my shirt.

34:42.681 --> 34:44.781
We need... We need to buy
a purple mask.

34:46.317 --> 34:48.285
<i>[Jenny] After about
a year and a half,</i>

34:48.287 --> 34:50.320
he said I'm gonna
fly you to India

34:50.322 --> 34:53.123
and we're gonna get married,
let's get married.

34:56.294 --> 34:59.296
[Sumit speaking]

35:05.336 --> 35:07.504
<i>[Jenny] Sumit's parents
don't want us to be together</i>

35:07.506 --> 35:09.840
<i>because I'm 30 years
older than he is.</i>

35:15.613 --> 35:17.848
<i>[Jenny] Four years later,
I gave up everything</i>

35:17.850 --> 35:20.917
<i>to go move to India
because Sumit told me</i>

35:20.919 --> 35:23.220
that this time
we're gonna get married.

35:24.422 --> 35:26.123
Oh my God.

35:26.125 --> 35:28.024
There you are.

35:28.026 --> 35:29.793
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:30.995 --> 35:32.395
[Jenny speaking]

35:35.333 --> 35:36.733
<i>Things didn't go as planned.</i>

35:36.735 --> 35:38.635
It didn't turn out as I hoped.

35:38.637 --> 35:41.338
Sumit was
keeping a secret from me.

35:43.207 --> 35:44.774
They took Sumit.

35:44.776 --> 35:48.011
His father-in-law
took him away from here.

35:50.014 --> 35:51.848
<i>It was heartbreaking finding out</i>

35:51.850 --> 35:53.683
<i>that Sumit was in
an arranged marriage</i>

35:53.685 --> 35:55.685
<i>and had been lying to me.</i>

35:55.687 --> 35:58.321
<i>So I went back home to the US,</i>

35:58.323 --> 36:00.056
but he assured me

36:00.058 --> 36:01.725
that he was gonna get
his divorce

36:01.727 --> 36:04.561
and we would be back
together again.

36:04.563 --> 36:06.763
[dramatic music playing]

36:11.202 --> 36:12.969
<i>[Jenny] So last year,
I moved back to India</i>

36:12.971 --> 36:15.272
<i>after Sumit filed
for his divorce.</i>

36:20.111 --> 36:21.378
<i>I thought we were gonna married</i>

36:21.380 --> 36:22.746
<i>for sure this time.</i>

36:22.748 --> 36:24.788
I didn't think anything
would stop us.

36:27.418 --> 36:29.219
Yes. Let's go.

36:29.221 --> 36:32.556
Unfortunately, that wasn't
the end of our problems.

36:46.604 --> 36:48.505
[Jenny] Is there anything
his parents can do

36:48.507 --> 36:51.308
to keep us from getting married?

37:00.451 --> 37:03.453
[in Hindi]

37:05.256 --> 37:07.991
[woman] [in Hindi]

37:15.666 --> 37:18.301
Every time we try
to get married,

37:18.303 --> 37:21.638
something stops us
every single time.

37:21.640 --> 37:24.808
[dramatic music playing]

37:27.778 --> 37:29.613
<i>[Jenny] Now I feel like
there are no other options</i>

37:29.615 --> 37:31.748
for us to get married.

37:34.452 --> 37:36.152
<i>But I'm not ready to leave
the country,</i>

37:36.154 --> 37:39.122
<i>and I'm not definitely
to leave Sumit.</i>

37:40.858 --> 37:43.526
So this morning,
Sumit is taking me somewhere,

37:43.528 --> 37:45.562
he loves to surprise me.

37:45.564 --> 37:48.198
<i>He's taking me somewhere
to show me something</i>

37:48.200 --> 37:50.967
<i>that he's very excited about.</i>

37:50.969 --> 37:53.370
So where are we going?
What's the surprise?

37:55.740 --> 37:57.207
Your astrologer?

38:03.147 --> 38:05.715
Okay.

38:05.717 --> 38:08.818
<i>I don't believe in astrology,
but Sumit does</i>

38:08.820 --> 38:10.487
and he's been going
to this astrologer

38:10.489 --> 38:12.088
with his family
since he was a kid.

38:12.090 --> 38:13.990
<i>So if this is what
it's gonna take,</i>

38:13.992 --> 38:15.859
<i>okay, let's see how it goes.</i>

38:15.861 --> 38:18.228
- [Sumit speaking]
- [Jenny] As ready as I can be.

38:24.535 --> 38:29.306
[Sumit speaking]

38:40.418 --> 38:42.052
Okay.

38:42.054 --> 38:45.088
[Sumit speaking]

38:59.704 --> 39:01.705
[Jenny] Sumit has every faith
and every belief

39:01.707 --> 39:03.707
that the astrologer will tell us

39:03.709 --> 39:06.176
like what's gonna happen
in our future.

39:06.178 --> 39:08.545
<i>But what if the astrologer
gives us bad news?</i>

39:08.547 --> 39:10.714
<i>What if the astrologer says
we can't be together,</i>

39:10.716 --> 39:12.282
<i>we can't get married?</i>

39:12.284 --> 39:13.683
<i>Then what?</i>

39:13.685 --> 39:15.605
That scares me, that worries me.

- [Jenny] 57.

5:00 AM in the morning,

40:01.867 --> 40:03.733
- when I'm born, right?
- [Khalid] Okay.

40:03.735 --> 40:06.069

40:08.139 --> 40:12.108
[Sumit speaking]

40:12.110 --> 40:15.378
Yeah. Because I really
never believed in astrology.

41:06.897 --> 41:09.132
[Sumit speaking]

41:16.440 --> 41:19.075
[Jenny] I actually have
a ten-year tourist visa

41:19.077 --> 41:20.944
<i>for here in India,
but I have to leave</i>

41:20.946 --> 41:23.079
<i>the country every six months,</i>

41:23.081 --> 41:25.081
and then I can actually
just come right back in,

41:25.083 --> 41:26.783
<i>but because of the lockdown</i>

41:26.785 --> 41:28.985
<i>I've been able to get
my visa extended</i>

41:28.987 --> 41:30.787
<i>for several months now.</i>

41:30.789 --> 41:33.256
But we're afraid that
when the flights resume,

41:33.258 --> 41:34.924
that they're gonna say,
"Okay, Jenny,

41:34.926 --> 41:36.659
you know, your visa is...
We're not extending it

41:36.661 --> 41:37.781
anymore, you got to go."

41:54.578 --> 41:55.712
Okay.

41:59.283 --> 42:01.017
<i>[Jenny] Whatever
that astrologer says,</i>

42:01.019 --> 42:02.218
<i>I don't care.</i>

42:02.220 --> 42:04.254
<i>Sumit needs to marry me.</i>

42:04.256 --> 42:06.022
I mean, it's sad,
I wish that the man

42:06.024 --> 42:08.858
that I love could just make
a decision.

42:08.860 --> 42:12.428
<i>And stop listening
to anybody else,</i>

42:12.430 --> 42:15.231

your parents, anybody,

42:15.233 --> 42:17.500
and go ahead
and do what you wanna do,

42:17.502 --> 42:20.570
this is what you say
you want then let's do it.

42:20.572 --> 42:22.872
Keep me here, let's stay
together, and let's be happy.

- [Bob] Okay.

44:43.148 --> 44:47.350
Welcome to our church services
this morning.

44:47.352 --> 44:51.287
Today we're going to be
talking about the family.

<i>[Steven] Currently I'm living
with my mom,</i>

in the basement.

45:00.932 --> 45:04.067
We are going to review
a proclamation

45:04.069 --> 45:06.703
which was given
by the Church of Jesus Christ

45:06.705 --> 45:09.405
of Latter-day Saints.

45:09.407 --> 45:11.340
[Steven] I'm a member
of the Church of Jesus Christ

45:11.342 --> 45:12.408
of Latter-day Saints.

45:12.410 --> 45:13.843
<i>People call them Mormons</i>

45:13.845 --> 45:16.145
but Mormon is just a nickname

45:16.147 --> 45:18.815
because of the Book of Mormon.

45:18.817 --> 45:20.817
<i>Since the start of the pandemic,</i>

45:20.819 --> 45:22.418
<i>all the church meetings

<i>are to be conducted at home.</i>

45:24.656 --> 45:27.590
We just read scriptures
and discuss it as a family.

45:29.393 --> 45:32.762
<i>My faith has always been
superbly important to me.</i>

45:32.764 --> 45:35.364
<i>When I was 19 years old,</i>

45:35.366 --> 45:36.566
I got called to go on a mission,

45:36.568 --> 45:38.901
so for the next two years,

45:38.903 --> 45:40.503
<i>I lived in Eastern Europe</i>

45:40.505 --> 45:42.338
<i>and I learned to speak Russian.</i>

45:42.340 --> 45:44.207
I'm super grateful
that I did learn it

45:44.209 --> 45:46.776
because now I have Alina.

46:12.737 --> 46:15.271
<i>We met on a language
exchange site</i>

46:15.273 --> 46:17.206
and I started helping her
with English a little bit,

46:17.208 --> 46:18.741

with Russian.

46:24.149 --> 46:25.782
<i>we were kind of interested
in each other.</i>

46:25.784 --> 46:28.618
<i>So I said something
kind of flirty</i>

46:28.620 --> 46:31.287
like, "Can I have
your number?"

46:31.289 --> 46:33.055
That kind of a thing.

46:33.057 --> 46:35.124
<i>We started calling each other
every day</i>

46:35.126 --> 46:37.293
<i>and since then
we haven't stopped.</i>

46:41.064 --> 46:42.265
[Steven]
<i>I was really interested</i>

46:42.267 --> 46:43.966
<i>in meeting this girl</i>

46:43.968 --> 46:46.869

and in Russia
they kind of see us

46:48.573 --> 46:50.873
as a cult,
so she was super nervous

46:50.875 --> 46:54.377
and she didn't even
wanna meet-up with me

46:54.379 --> 46:57.647
because she's afraid that
I was gonna sell her organs.

46:57.649 --> 46:59.148
[producer speaking]

46:59.150 --> 47:00.850
[laughs]

47:04.321 --> 47:07.290
<i>I decided to invite
her mom, inviting my mom,</i>

47:07.292 --> 47:09.158
maybe like convince her like,

47:09.160 --> 47:10.660
"Hey, like,

47:10.662 --> 47:11.894
I'm not gonna harvest
your organs,

47:11.896 --> 47:13.496
I'm not gonna kidnap you.

47:13.498 --> 47:15.064
Your mom will be there."

47:15.066 --> 47:16.799
Which is, kind of, silly,
I thought,

47:16.801 --> 47:18.868
because it'd be just as easy
to kidnap two people

47:18.870 --> 47:22.872
but it made her comfortable
and then she agreed.

47:24.741 --> 47:27.476
The first time I met Alina
in person

47:27.478 --> 47:30.613
<i>she comes out of the elevator,</i>

47:30.615 --> 47:32.548
we had made eye contact,
and I run up,

47:32.550 --> 47:34.717
and I hug her.

47:34.719 --> 47:36.352
<i>And it seems like
something off a movie,</i>

47:36.354 --> 47:40.156
we're like instantly
like connected.

47:42.025 --> 47:43.526
[Alina] Mmm-hmm.

47:43.528 --> 47:46.195
Everything was so new
and exciting.

47:46.197 --> 47:48.598
<i>I love just walking
the streets with her</i>

47:48.600 --> 47:50.833
<i>and just holding her hand.</i>

47:50.835 --> 47:53.703
It was just like
a magical two weeks.

47:55.038 --> 47:57.106
So we called it
best first date ever.

48:00.077 --> 48:03.779
<i>Now we've been dating
for over a year</i>

48:03.781 --> 48:05.821
and we wanna start
our lives together.

48:08.285 --> 48:10.920
Do, do, do, do, do.

48:10.922 --> 48:14.223
We were initially planning
for me to move to Russia.

48:14.225 --> 48:17.360
<i>So Alina could finish
her college,</i>

48:17.362 --> 48:22.131
but the pandemic
has drastically changed

48:22.133 --> 48:23.933
and affected our plan.

48:23.935 --> 48:25.568
Oh, Mom, we need the little cups

48:25.570 --> 48:27.436
and plates for people, don't we?

48:27.438 --> 48:29.338
- [Julie] I wasn't gonna...
- Or is it finger food?

48:29.340 --> 48:31.007
[Julie] That's finger food.

48:31.009 --> 48:32.408
<i>[Steven] The border
is closed to Russia,</i>

48:32.410 --> 48:33.910
<i>so we had to look
for another country</i>

48:33.912 --> 48:35.378
<i>where we could be together.</i>

48:35.380 --> 48:36.779
We happened to find Turkey

48:36.781 --> 48:39.348
which allowed both
Russians and Americans.

48:39.350 --> 48:42.118
So we're moving to Turkey.

48:42.120 --> 48:43.853
- Oh, hello.
- Hey, what's up dudes?

48:43.855 --> 48:45.621
How's it going?

48:45.623 --> 48:47.189
I'm glad you came.

48:47.191 --> 48:48.758
<i>I'll be flying to Turkey
in just one week</i>

48:48.760 --> 48:50.693
and before I go
I really wanna spend time

48:50.695 --> 48:53.296
with my friends and family
because, to be honest,

48:53.298 --> 48:55.464
I don't know when I'm gonna
be seeing them again.

48:55.466 --> 48:58.801
- Do you have COVID?
- Come on here, bro.

48:58.803 --> 49:00.670
<i>[Steven] My brother
Mitch and Jerdon</i>

but we still gather on Sundays

49:04.809 --> 49:08.210
for like Sunday dinner
and just to hang out.

49:08.212 --> 49:09.912
[Mitch] Cheers to the next
chapter, Steven.

49:09.914 --> 49:11.280
[Steven]
Cheers to the next chapter.

49:11.282 --> 49:12.381
Cheers.

49:14.651 --> 49:16.419
I have to fart,
I'll be right back.

49:16.421 --> 49:18.020
- [laughter]
- [Bob] Okay.

49:18.022 --> 49:19.956
I'm gonna step over here.

49:19.958 --> 49:21.891
[laughter]

49:26.296 --> 49:30.967
[Jerdon] Pretty normal
for Steven to do.

49:30.969 --> 49:32.668
[Julie]
<i>I would describe Steven</i>

49:32.670 --> 49:35.671
as a little bit carefree.

49:35.673 --> 49:37.506
Honestly,
I don't get why everyone

49:37.508 --> 49:38.674
doesn't do that.

49:38.676 --> 49:40.176
I feel like it's a courtesy.

49:40.178 --> 49:42.678
[Julie] You can expect him to do

49:42.680 --> 49:45.614
weird random things, I guess.

49:45.616 --> 49:49.018
[Steven] I'm super excited
to head out this week.

49:49.020 --> 49:50.980
What are you feeling
nervous about?

49:52.055 --> 49:54.190
[Steven] Hmm.

49:54.192 --> 49:55.992
Neither of us speak Turkish,
we don't...

49:55.994 --> 49:57.994
We've never been there
and our goal

49:57.996 --> 49:59.495
is to hopefully from Turkey

49:59.497 --> 50:00.997
to be able to go to Russia

50:00.999 --> 50:02.665
and we have to get married

50:02.667 --> 50:05.234
before I'm allowed to even apply

50:05.236 --> 50:07.303
- for a Russian visa.
- [Julie] So the only way

50:07.305 --> 50:08.938
you can get into Russia

50:08.940 --> 50:10.172
is if you get married

50:10.174 --> 50:11.941
so you can get a spousal visa?

50:11.943 --> 50:13.943
Yeah, that's the only way.

50:13.945 --> 50:15.845
We only have 90 days in Turkey

50:15.847 --> 50:18.781
because we're on tourist visas.

50:18.783 --> 50:20.416
Like even though
we've been talking

50:20.418 --> 50:22.485
for over a year now
on the phone,

50:22.487 --> 50:24.420
it's like... I feel like
you have to know someone

50:24.422 --> 50:27.123
in person before making
that big of a decision.

50:27.125 --> 50:29.025
But I don't imagine
there's gonna be

50:29.027 --> 50:30.292
any problems,
but I just wanna...

50:30.294 --> 50:31.494
But they've only been together

50:31.496 --> 50:33.929
for two weeks, so, you know.

50:33.931 --> 50:37.600
[dramatic music playing]

50:37.602 --> 50:39.635
[Mitch] I mean, only knowing
each other for two weeks

50:39.637 --> 50:41.837
is kind of crazy.

50:41.839 --> 50:43.606
<i>And I'm worried that
they're gonna get there,</i>

50:43.608 --> 50:45.107
<i>that they're gonna get married,</i>

50:45.109 --> 50:47.243
and then at some point
a year or two

50:47.245 --> 50:49.745
or three down the road,

I want you to be happy.

1:03:44.488 --> 1:03:46.788
But this is not a joke.

1:03:46.790 --> 1:03:49.624
This is your entire life.

1:03:49.626 --> 1:03:52.127
I mean, I am scared to go

1:03:52.129 --> 1:03:55.797
but if it's like deep down,

1:03:55.799 --> 1:03:57.465
you know, you have to do it.

1:03:59.769 --> 1:04:01.736
[Hiromi] Yeah, I'm just scared

1:04:01.738 --> 1:04:04.306
that you're gonna get down there

1:04:04.308 --> 1:04:06.908
and you're not gonna
have support.

<i>[Ellie] I'm giving up a lot
to move to Providence, yeah,</i>

1:04:12.115 --> 1:04:14.616
when I look outside my body
and look at myself,

1:04:14.618 --> 1:04:17.118
I'm like,
"What are you doing?"

1:04:19.255 --> 1:04:23.291
I'm just gonna miss you,
that's all.

1:04:23.293 --> 1:04:25.927

- Can I get?
- [Ariela] Yeah.

1:12:11.594 --> 1:12:12.927
Me and Bini's sisters have

1:12:12.929 --> 1:12:14.829
like a tumultuous relationship.

1:12:14.831 --> 1:12:18.433

And, you know, honestly,

1:12:26.443 --> 1:12:27.842
I don't know
if that's important for you.

1:12:27.844 --> 1:12:29.510
I feel like it's you guys

1:12:29.512 --> 1:12:33.448
who really put pressure
on him to get a baptism.

1:12:33.450 --> 1:12:36.451

<i>You know, it can be isolating</i>

1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:52.467
because this is supposed
to be my new family

1:12:52.469 --> 1:12:54.635
but they're not acting like it.

1:12:55.871 --> 1:12:57.138
Did you open up your shop again

1:12:57.140 --> 1:12:59.674
or is it closed
because of coronavirus?

1:13:04.179 --> 1:13:05.713

1:15:08.238 --> 1:15:09.770
What?

1:15:15.010 --> 1:15:16.344
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I know.

1:15:16.346 --> 1:15:17.879
We did. We hung out. So?

1:15:29.391 --> 1:15:31.225
Yeah, but what I told you,
I told you that

1:15:31.227 --> 1:15:33.227
which I didn't tell you that,
Mimi.

1:15:39.434 --> 1:15:41.202
<i>[Ariela] Wish tells me
things in confidence</i>

like we're developing

1:15:44.474 --> 1:15:46.240

I didn't do anything wrong,

1:15:46.242 --> 1:15:48.075
<i>I had no problem
telling her that.</i>

1:15:48.077 --> 1:15:50.077
And when I told Wish
the secret that Leandro

1:15:50.079 --> 1:15:52.079
would come to stay with me
in my apartment for two weeks,

1:15:52.081 --> 1:15:53.748
she didn't act like
it was a big deal then.

1:15:53.750 --> 1:15:56.250

why she's doing this now.

1:15:57.753 --> 1:16:00.221
[Biniyam speaking]

1:16:00.223 --> 1:16:02.590
[Ariela] No, because...
No, I'm not hiding it from you

1:16:02.592 --> 1:16:04.425
but I didn't tell you
because I know

1:16:04.427 --> 1:16:06.928
that you're gonna be jealous
and you're so far away.

1:16:09.698 --> 1:16:12.733

No, baby,
I didn't sleep with him.

1:16:26.883 --> 1:16:28.416
No.

No, I know
but I didn't sleep with him.

1:16:29.686 --> 1:16:31.285
It's two different rooms.

once you see us together,

1:16:36.926 --> 1:16:38.092
you're not gonna be
jealous anymore.

1:16:38.094 --> 1:16:39.427

1:18:43.219 --> 1:18:45.186

extension was closed

1:18:48.558 --> 1:18:50.825
instead of approved.

1:18:50.827 --> 1:18:53.194
It's never said this before.

1:18:53.196 --> 1:18:54.829
Usually it says
it's been approved

1:18:54.831 --> 1:18:56.897
and it'll tell me
from what date to what date

1:18:56.899 --> 1:18:58.999
it's been approved till
but this time

1:18:59.001 --> 1:19:00.868
it sounds like
they didn't approve it to me.

1:19:00.870 --> 1:19:02.937
That's what it sounds like.

1:19:17.252 --> 1:19:18.686
Which means that
I'm gonna have to now

1:19:18.688 --> 1:19:20.254
leave the country.

1:19:20.256 --> 1:19:22.189

I've applied

1:19:25.361 --> 1:19:26.727
for a visa extension,

1:19:26.729 --> 1:19:28.095
it's always come back approved.

<i>Seeing this email
come in saying closed,</i>

1:19:30.967 --> 1:19:32.967
this is exactly
what I'm afraid of.

1:19:32.969 --> 1:19:35.302
Like, I am always
constantly worried

1:19:35.304 --> 1:19:38.038
and afraid at any time,
at any month,

1:19:38.040 --> 1:19:39.540
I'm gonna have to leave
the country

and go back to America.

1:20:09.838 --> 1:20:11.338
Yeah. Okay.

1:20:11.340 --> 1:20:13.374
So then let's talk
to a travel agent

1:20:13.376 --> 1:20:15.309
- and see what they tell us.
- Yeah, we should.

1:20:15.311 --> 1:20:17.344
[Jenny] Because right now,
I'm really scared.

1:20:17.346 --> 1:20:19.747
[Sumit speaking]

1:20:27.856 --> 1:20:30.858
- [Gudal speaking]
- [Sumit speaking]

1:20:40.635 --> 1:20:43.003
[Gudal speaking]

1:20:45.574 --> 1:20:48.576
[dramatic music playing]

1:20:53.949 --> 1:20:56.951
[Sumit speaking]

1:21:30.285 --> 1:21:33.153
[Gudal speaking]

1:21:37.959 --> 1:21:39.393
Bali?

1:21:45.867 --> 1:21:47.868
- [Gudal speaking]
- Yeah.

1:21:49.070 --> 1:21:50.738
[Sumit speaking]

1:22:01.549 --> 1:22:04.184
[Gudal speaking]

1:22:11.893 --> 1:22:13.427
[Gudal speaking]

1:22:21.770 --> 1:22:23.103
Okay. Well,
tell him thank you.

1:22:23.105 --> 1:22:24.905
There's nothing
he can do for us.

1:22:24.907 --> 1:22:28.575
[Sumit speaking]

1:22:28.577 --> 1:22:30.244
[Gudal speaking]

1:22:30.246 --> 1:22:31.845
[Jenny] Thank you.

1:22:31.847 --> 1:22:33.681
[Gudal speaking]

1:22:33.683 --> 1:22:35.783
[Sumit] Okay, okay, okay.

1:22:37.452 --> 1:22:41.722
Well, looks like
I'm going back to America.

1:22:49.798 --> 1:22:51.165
Go against your parents
and get married

1:22:51.167 --> 1:22:53.600
then I can stay in the country.

1:22:53.602 --> 1:22:57.504
[Sumit speaking]

1:22:57.506 --> 1:22:59.406
Okay. Well then I'm going back
to America, Sumit.

1:22:59.408 --> 1:23:01.241
That's it.

1:23:03.311 --> 1:23:04.478
We've been living in this house

1:23:04.480 --> 1:23:05.946
for a long time together.

1:23:05.948 --> 1:23:07.948
This is my life.
This has been my life.

1:23:07.950 --> 1:23:09.450
And now I have to go back
to America,

1:23:09.452 --> 1:23:11.785
back to nothing again?

1:23:11.787 --> 1:23:13.053
This is ridiculous.

1:23:13.055 --> 1:23:15.022
I can't keep doing this.

1:23:15.024 --> 1:23:18.692
I'm ruining my life basically,
you know that?

1:23:18.694 --> 1:23:22.463
You promised me we were gonna
get married this time.

1:23:22.465 --> 1:23:24.832
I wouldn't have came back.

1:23:24.834 --> 1:23:27.468
Now I have to leave the country.

1:23:30.705 --> 1:23:32.272
You can change the situation.

1:23:32.274 --> 1:23:33.307
[Sumit speaking]

1:23:33.309 --> 1:23:35.175
If we get married.

1:23:36.611 --> 1:23:38.512
I came here to marry you
so I would never have

1:23:38.514 --> 1:23:41.448
- to leave India again.
- [Sumit speaking]

1:23:41.450 --> 1:23:43.530
[Jenny] Do you know
my situation or not?

1:23:44.853 --> 1:23:46.086
- No, you don't.
- [Sumit speaking]

1:23:46.088 --> 1:23:47.654
You don't know my situation.

1:23:47.656 --> 1:23:49.490
No, you don't.

1:23:49.492 --> 1:23:52.760
What do I have to go back to?
You tell me.

1:23:52.762 --> 1:23:55.129
I have no home
to go back to, okay?

1:23:55.131 --> 1:23:56.997
I have nothing.

1:23:56.999 --> 1:23:59.066
And how many times
can I keep believing you?

1:23:59.068 --> 1:24:02.269
"I'm gonna marry you, Jenny."
Keep coming back. Okay.

1:24:02.271 --> 1:24:03.804
I'll leave everything
and I'll come back

1:24:03.806 --> 1:24:06.306
- and let's get married.
- [Sumit speaking]

1:24:07.942 --> 1:24:10.144
Okay. It's always because
of your parents though.

1:24:10.146 --> 1:24:13.080
It's always because
of your parents every time.

1:24:13.082 --> 1:24:16.150
First time, second time,
third time.

1:24:16.152 --> 1:24:18.285
Always.

1:24:18.287 --> 1:24:20.087
I'm gonna leave
and go back to America

1:24:20.089 --> 1:24:22.122
and I'm not gonna come back.

1:24:29.230 --> 1:24:31.632
[Sumit speaking]

1:24:36.538 --> 1:24:38.672
Why would I come back
for the fourth time? Why?

1:24:38.674 --> 1:24:40.340
- [Sumit speaking]
- For what?

1:24:40.342 --> 1:24:42.910
For what? I can't stay
in the country.

1:24:45.847 --> 1:24:47.548
I'm not gonna keep coming back

1:24:47.550 --> 1:24:48.849
and leaving every damn
six months.

1:24:48.851 --> 1:24:50.250
I'm not gonna keep doing it.

1:24:50.252 --> 1:24:51.652
You're not gonna keep telling me

1:24:51.654 --> 1:24:53.253
you're gonna marry [bleep] not.

1:24:53.255 --> 1:24:55.289
That's it!

1:24:58.126 --> 1:25:01.528
[bleep]
I'm done with all this crap.

1:25:01.530 --> 1:25:03.564
[bleep] you, Sumit.

1:25:03.566 --> 1:25:06.300
I'm never listening
to you again.

1:25:06.302 --> 1:25:08.902
Booking my flight
and I'm [bleep] leaving.
