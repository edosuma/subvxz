WEBVTT

00:04.265 --> 00:07.137
Cover him!

00:07.137 --> 00:08.747
She took the brunt
of the blast.

00:10.880 --> 00:13.448
Is this ever gonna end?

00:13.448 --> 00:15.711
What we have here
is lung cancer.

00:15.711 --> 00:17.017
Are you sure about this?

00:17.017 --> 00:18.061
I mean, that can't be right.

00:18.061 --> 00:19.671
What do we do next?

00:19.671 --> 00:22.979
<i>I'd like to schedule surgery
for as soon as possible.</i>

00:22.979 --> 00:24.372
Dylan, hey.

00:24.372 --> 00:27.505
I wanted to ask,
do you wanna grab lunch?

00:27.505 --> 00:29.986
Is this outfit way too much
for a coffee date?

00:29.986 --> 00:32.858
<i>No, it's perfect.
Seriously, you look beautiful.</i>

00:35.383 --> 00:39.169
And now with the help
of my lovely assistant,

00:39.169 --> 00:41.954
I will perform my final trick.

00:41.954 --> 00:44.174
But first...

00:44.174 --> 00:46.176
Some flowers for the lady.

00:46.176 --> 00:48.048
- Oh.
- VoilÃ .

00:48.048 --> 00:49.179
Thank you.

00:49.179 --> 00:50.180
No applause on that one.

00:50.180 --> 00:52.922
Just get to the grand finale.

00:52.922 --> 00:56.012
So for my last trick,

00:56.012 --> 01:00.538
I will pull a rabbit out
of my magic hat.

01:00.538 --> 01:01.757
Thank you.

01:01.757 --> 01:05.021
As you can see,
nothing up my sleeve.

01:05.021 --> 01:06.414
Nothing in the hat.

01:06.414 --> 01:10.200
But with a wave of my wand
and a tap on the hat,

01:10.200 --> 01:15.162
out of nowhere
appears a rabbit.

01:15.162 --> 01:16.728
all:
Boo!

01:16.728 --> 01:18.078
What?

01:18.078 --> 01:19.166
You wanted a live rabbit?

01:19.166 --> 01:21.124
all:
Yes!

01:23.126 --> 01:28.044
I don't know if I have
a live rabbit on me.

01:28.044 --> 01:30.916
Uh, do you?

01:30.916 --> 01:31.917
Uh.

01:31.917 --> 01:33.658
Oh, you know what?

01:36.183 --> 01:37.314
There he is.

01:37.314 --> 01:40.187
all: Aw!

01:40.187 --> 01:42.319
This is Thumper.

01:42.319 --> 01:43.886
Everybody say hello.

01:43.886 --> 01:46.106
all:
Hi, Thumper.

01:49.196 --> 01:50.849
Thanks so much
for coming out this morning.

01:50.849 --> 01:52.547
I know it's barely daylight.

01:52.547 --> 01:54.331
Well, this isn't
even early for me.

01:54.331 --> 01:56.246
Plus, it's fun
to watch you work.

01:56.246 --> 01:57.987
Well, you might
think differently

01:57.987 --> 01:59.771
after next month's
sing-along hour.

01:59.771 --> 02:02.644
Setting the bar low,
smart move.

02:06.691 --> 02:08.954
- Herrmann.
- Hey, Chief.

02:08.954 --> 02:10.173
Just putting in some paperwork.

02:10.173 --> 02:12.044
I need to request off
next shift.

02:12.044 --> 02:13.959
What, you getting away
for the weekend?

02:13.959 --> 02:15.439
Uh, no.

02:15.439 --> 02:18.268
Cindy, she's--
she's got a scheduled surgery

02:18.268 --> 02:20.183
at Med on Thursday.

02:20.183 --> 02:21.489
Everything all right?

02:21.489 --> 02:23.839
Yeah, no, everything's fine.
Just routine.

02:23.839 --> 02:25.449
Okay.

02:25.449 --> 02:27.321
I'll file the paperwork today,
put in for a relief officer

02:27.321 --> 02:28.322
this afternoon.

02:28.322 --> 02:29.758
Okay, thanks, Chief.

02:32.064 --> 02:33.936
'69 Cubs.

02:33.936 --> 02:36.721
Best team of all time.

02:36.721 --> 02:37.896
Agreed.

02:37.896 --> 02:41.335
Banks, Williams,
Jenkins, oh, Ron Santo?

02:41.335 --> 02:42.727
- Mm.
- All Hall of Famers.

02:42.727 --> 02:43.815
Pfft.

02:43.815 --> 02:45.252
They didn't even
make the postseason.

02:45.252 --> 02:46.470
2016, hands down.

02:46.470 --> 02:48.298
103 wins and the World Series.

02:48.298 --> 02:50.300
It's not about wins.

02:50.300 --> 02:51.910
It's about excitement.
- Mm-hmm.

02:51.910 --> 02:53.869
It's about team unity.

02:53.869 --> 02:56.176
The bunker gear
is back from the cleaners,

02:56.176 --> 02:57.655
so come and get 'em.

02:57.655 --> 02:59.788
If it needs to be replaced
or repaired, let me know,

02:59.788 --> 03:02.051
and I'll put a request
into the commissary.

03:02.051 --> 03:03.835
all:
Thank you, Kylie.

03:03.835 --> 03:07.622
Last time I got a new jacket,
Clinton was still in office.

03:07.622 --> 03:12.583
Well, they are
designed to be indestructible.

03:12.583 --> 03:13.715
Hmm.

03:15.891 --> 03:17.153
Here you go.

03:17.153 --> 03:18.850
It's a candidate
for a replacement.

03:18.850 --> 03:20.896
Might be time to put in
for a new coat, Lieutenant.

03:20.896 --> 03:22.332
Not a chance.
This is my lucky jacket.

03:23.942 --> 03:26.031
<i>Ambulance 61, Truck 81,
wellness check,</i>

03:26.031 --> 03:27.816
<i>331 Lime Oak Drive.</i>

03:41.308 --> 03:43.527
331 Lime Oak.

03:51.187 --> 03:52.493
Fire department!

04:00.936 --> 04:02.720
Hello?

04:02.720 --> 04:04.766
Fire department!

04:04.766 --> 04:06.246
Call out!

04:08.726 --> 04:09.945
Fire department!

04:20.347 --> 04:22.653
Upstairs is clear.

04:24.307 --> 04:26.614
All right,
let's check the backyard.

04:28.442 --> 04:30.008
I don't like
the look of that.

04:31.445 --> 04:32.576
Me neither.

04:37.451 --> 04:38.800
Stay alert.

04:41.977 --> 04:43.413
Fire department!

04:45.981 --> 04:47.591
Anybody here?

04:49.158 --> 04:50.507
Hello?

04:53.031 --> 04:54.468
Lieutenant!

05:07.263 --> 05:09.570
Hey, can you
hear me in there?

05:13.443 --> 05:15.358
Squad's here.

05:15.358 --> 05:16.968
Hey, what are we looking at?

05:16.968 --> 05:19.014
We got an unconscious victim
trapped in some kind

05:19.014 --> 05:20.711
of homemade fallout shelter.

05:20.711 --> 05:22.844
The door's made out of steel.

05:22.844 --> 05:24.454
Bulletproof glass.

05:24.454 --> 05:25.977
It's locked from the inside.

05:25.977 --> 05:28.328
It seems like the ventilation
system isn't up to snuff,

05:28.328 --> 05:31.635
so trying to get
an air reading now.

05:31.635 --> 05:33.245
Capp, Tony, grab the tanks.

05:33.245 --> 05:35.900
Cruz, let's get ready
to spark up the arc air torch.

05:35.900 --> 05:37.249
Copy.

05:37.249 --> 05:38.425
Truck, get ready.

05:38.425 --> 05:39.730
Have your irons
to pull the door off.

05:39.730 --> 05:41.819
- Copy.
- Oh, my God!

05:41.819 --> 05:42.907
Oh, my God.

05:42.907 --> 05:44.518
Did you find Kevin?
- Hey, hey, hey.

05:44.518 --> 05:46.041
Who are you?
- I'm his sister.

05:46.041 --> 05:47.956
I'm the one that made
the 911 call.

05:47.956 --> 05:50.393
Okay, hey, when was the
last time you talked to him?

05:50.393 --> 05:51.829
Two days ago.

05:51.829 --> 05:54.702
He was going on and on about
the collapse of society.

05:54.702 --> 05:56.660
5G, Russian bots.
Oh, my God, he's obsessed.

05:56.660 --> 05:59.010
He thinks the world is ending.

05:59.010 --> 06:01.578
Hey, I'm seeing something
around the frame of this door.

06:03.667 --> 06:04.929
Could be a tripwire.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.328
- Okay, hey.
- Move.

06:12.328 --> 06:15.026
We saw some incendiary
ingredients in the kitchen.

06:15.026 --> 06:18.029
So maybe we should
find another way in.

06:19.335 --> 06:21.685
We could crack the
base plate of that air vent,

06:21.685 --> 06:23.644
extricate the victim
from the inside out.

06:25.428 --> 06:28.213
16% oxygen, lieutenant.

06:28.213 --> 06:30.868
Hey, listen, we don't have
time to get through the vent.

06:30.868 --> 06:32.957
Squad, get ready
to hit the door.

06:32.957 --> 06:34.437
Hold on. Hey.

06:34.437 --> 06:36.047
Hold on.

06:36.047 --> 06:37.571
Listen, what if this guy
is on a suicide mission?

06:37.571 --> 06:39.050
I doubt he'd wanna
blow up his own bunker.

06:39.050 --> 06:40.661
It's probably just
a scare tactic.

06:40.661 --> 06:41.879
Squad, get in position.

06:41.879 --> 06:43.707
Truck, get ready
with your Halligans.

06:43.707 --> 06:46.318
Kelly, if something explodes,
we are all toast here.

06:46.318 --> 06:49.060
Stella, we don't have time
to debate this, okay?

06:49.060 --> 06:50.627
Cover your unit.

07:25.967 --> 07:28.056
All right, clear!

07:28.056 --> 07:29.361
All right, me and you, Carver.

07:34.845 --> 07:36.586
Right here.

07:37.718 --> 07:38.936
I got it.

07:38.936 --> 07:40.198
Right here.

07:42.331 --> 07:44.115
All right.

07:44.115 --> 07:45.203
On three.

07:45.203 --> 07:48.076
One, two, three.

07:52.472 --> 07:55.257
- Lieutenant!
- All good, just a flash bang.

07:55.257 --> 07:56.954
I got it.

08:00.131 --> 08:01.306
- Hey, Cruz!
- Yeah?

08:01.306 --> 08:04.440
Grab the skid.
Tony, Capp, man the rope.

08:14.668 --> 08:16.234
All right, let's go.

08:16.234 --> 08:18.367
Skid.
- Coming down.

08:18.367 --> 08:19.411
Got it.

08:28.682 --> 08:31.511
Okay.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.556
Tony, on you.

08:40.258 --> 08:42.347
Last one. Here we go.

08:51.095 --> 08:53.402
Pulse is faint.

08:53.402 --> 08:55.012
All right,
breathing's agonal.

08:55.012 --> 08:56.492
Let's tube him
and get a monitor on him.

08:56.492 --> 08:57.493
You got it.

08:59.451 --> 09:00.844
Ambu bag.

09:03.325 --> 09:04.326
Got it.

09:06.458 --> 09:08.591
Tube is good.

09:08.591 --> 09:10.898
Okay, he's bradycardia,
but pulse is still good.

09:10.898 --> 09:12.508
Oh, thank God.

09:12.508 --> 09:14.118
Kev.

09:14.118 --> 09:16.904
He's not out of the woods.
Let's get him to Med.

09:16.904 --> 09:18.775
Everybody, load up.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.531
Nurse said our victim's
oxygen is already up.

09:35.531 --> 09:36.837
It's a good sign.

09:36.837 --> 09:38.882
Also, I just got a call

09:38.882 --> 09:40.580
from the financial oversight office.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.539
The audit on the paramedicine
program is officially closed.

09:43.539 --> 09:45.019
Oh, that's great!

09:45.019 --> 09:47.195
Yeah, CFD brass
is pretty eager

09:47.195 --> 09:48.762
to wipe their hands clean
of Emma Jacobs.

09:48.762 --> 09:50.111
Me too.

09:52.809 --> 09:54.855
Are you wearing glitter?

09:54.855 --> 09:57.161
Oh, Dylan
needed an assistant

09:57.161 --> 09:58.554
for his magic act this morning.

09:58.554 --> 10:01.644
- Oh. How's it going?
- Good. Really good.

10:01.644 --> 10:02.602
Pretty good.

10:04.473 --> 10:05.430
Hmm.

10:10.044 --> 10:11.393
Get ready to have
your mind blown.

10:11.393 --> 10:13.569
- Oh.
<i>- Hey, fam.</i>

10:13.569 --> 10:17.138
<i>Hoping to be reunited
with a firefighter I met</i>

10:17.138 --> 10:19.009
<i>a few weeks ago
when the showroom</i>

10:19.009 --> 10:20.576
<i>at the Home Trader I work at</i>

10:20.576 --> 10:22.709
<i>caught fire for, like,
the third time this month.</i>

10:22.709 --> 10:24.319
She's cute.

10:24.319 --> 10:26.321
<i>I couldn't see his face
clearly through the mask,</i>

10:26.321 --> 10:30.368
<i>but I could tell he's
around my age and handsome.</i>

10:30.368 --> 10:32.544
<i>So I'm putting this out
to you, TikTok.</i>

10:32.544 --> 10:35.678
<i>Help me find my knight
in shining armor.</i>

10:35.678 --> 10:37.680
Well, didn't you guys
respond to a fire

10:37.680 --> 10:38.768
at Home Trader a few weeks ago?

10:38.768 --> 10:40.378
Yeah, we did.

10:40.378 --> 10:42.859
She is talking
about you, man.

10:42.859 --> 10:44.121
Yeah, I don't know.

10:44.121 --> 10:47.429
Well, it isn't Kidd or Mouch.

10:47.429 --> 10:48.299
Maybe Carver.

10:48.299 --> 10:49.344
He was out that day.

10:49.344 --> 10:50.693
We had a floater, Jim Lotta.

10:50.693 --> 10:51.999
And that dude's, like, 90.

10:51.999 --> 10:54.131
Ah, see?

10:54.131 --> 10:55.350
You should DM her.

10:55.350 --> 10:56.873
I wouldn't.
Thirst trap.

10:56.873 --> 10:58.832
Capp.

10:58.832 --> 11:01.356
Hey, I met Chloe at a fire,

11:01.356 --> 11:02.618
and that worked out great
for me.

11:02.618 --> 11:05.186
Modern day
message in a bottle.

11:05.186 --> 11:07.275
Reminds me of those
Missed Connections

11:07.275 --> 11:08.711
they used to run
in the "Reader."

11:08.711 --> 11:10.408
You remember that, Herrmann?

11:10.408 --> 11:11.671
Herrmann!

11:11.671 --> 11:13.498
What?

11:13.498 --> 11:14.935
Oh, yeah.

11:17.981 --> 11:19.374
What do you have to lose?

11:21.898 --> 11:23.639
Okay, why not?

11:23.639 --> 11:25.336
Yeah.

11:29.601 --> 11:31.647
Hey, you got a second?

11:31.647 --> 11:33.170
Of course.

11:33.170 --> 11:34.955
Do you want to talk
about what you were seeing

11:34.955 --> 11:36.783
on that call that I wasn't?

11:36.783 --> 11:38.306
What do you mean?

11:38.306 --> 11:39.568
It was a good team effort.

11:39.568 --> 11:42.179
There's no point
in post-gaming it.

11:42.179 --> 11:44.573
I just feel like
you steamrolled me.

11:44.573 --> 11:46.749
You didn't respect
my assessment

11:46.749 --> 11:49.056
of the risks or the fact
that I was the first officer

11:49.056 --> 11:50.579
on the scene.

11:50.579 --> 11:52.755
It was
a Special Operations incident,

11:52.755 --> 11:55.149
which is why we were called
by dispatch.

11:55.149 --> 11:57.325
That makes it
the squad officer's call.

11:57.325 --> 11:59.806
Okay, but you could have
been wrong about the door.

11:59.806 --> 12:01.372
I wasn't. I wasn't.

12:01.372 --> 12:03.244
And you kept pushing twice.

12:03.244 --> 12:05.376
Had that been
any other squad lieutenant,

12:05.376 --> 12:07.639
you wouldn't have done that.
- That is not true.

12:07.639 --> 12:09.076
- Stella.
- You--

12:09.076 --> 12:10.251
Stella, I'm done
talking about it.

12:18.128 --> 12:21.305
And that, my friends, is why
you never bet against a Cruz.

12:21.305 --> 12:22.829
I still think
you were cheating.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.700
Yeah, there's no such thing
as a reverse float.

12:24.700 --> 12:27.355
Everybody up, we're drilling.

12:27.355 --> 12:30.010
We just got back from a call,
and I haven't finished

12:30.010 --> 12:31.141
taking all your money yet.

12:31.141 --> 12:32.839
North apron, dummy drags.

12:32.839 --> 12:35.102
Let's go, now.

12:57.951 --> 12:59.822
Ah. Hey, Chief.

12:59.822 --> 13:02.346
Got that list of relief
officers for next shift.

13:02.346 --> 13:05.393
Just wanna get your preferences
before making the call.

13:05.393 --> 13:07.003
Okay, great.

13:07.003 --> 13:08.309
I'll look it--
I'll look it over.

13:11.703 --> 13:13.705
Hey.

13:13.705 --> 13:15.838
Everything okay?

13:24.716 --> 13:26.893
Cindy's surgery is...

13:30.331 --> 13:32.072
It's cancer.

13:37.251 --> 13:38.687
Yeah.

13:40.210 --> 13:43.953
Just saying it out loud
makes it too real.

13:46.260 --> 13:51.439
I haven't--I haven't
mentioned it to anybody yet.

13:51.439 --> 13:54.398
What did the doctors say?

13:54.398 --> 13:56.052
Uh, that...

13:59.795 --> 14:01.492
They won't know
how serious it is

14:01.492 --> 14:04.931
until after the procedure.

14:04.931 --> 14:10.850
Look, if there is anything
you and Cindy need...

14:12.677 --> 14:14.244
I'm here for you, brother.

14:17.117 --> 14:18.248
I know.

14:23.123 --> 14:25.516
Thanks, Chief.

14:25.516 --> 14:28.998
Um, I'll look this over now.

14:28.998 --> 14:31.131
Yeah.

14:34.308 --> 14:37.137
Ooh, TikTok girl hit me up.

14:37.137 --> 14:38.225
Her name's Kayla.

14:38.225 --> 14:39.574
And she wants
to meet up tonight.

14:39.574 --> 14:41.402
Oh, that's great.
What's the plan?

14:41.402 --> 14:43.752
I'm thinking something fun, casual.

14:43.752 --> 14:45.406
What about that
indoor mini golf course?

14:45.406 --> 14:47.060
Hmm.

14:47.060 --> 14:48.626
Or you could do
trivia night at Walter's.

14:48.626 --> 14:49.932
I suck at trivia.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.716
And first dates are all
about showing off.

14:51.716 --> 14:52.935
Are they?

14:52.935 --> 14:54.589
Ooh, there's that bar
in Streeterville

14:54.589 --> 14:57.287
that does ax throwing.

14:57.287 --> 14:58.898
I would rock that.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.291
Drinking and throwing sharp
tools, what could go wrong?

15:01.291 --> 15:03.163
You know, you need
to open your mind.

15:03.163 --> 15:05.295
I wish I could have
that attitude about dating.

15:05.295 --> 15:06.688
What do you mean?

15:06.688 --> 15:10.083
Mm, just everything
fun and casual.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.346
Is it not that with Dylan?

15:12.346 --> 15:14.565
Well, after his magic act,
he texted me

15:14.565 --> 15:16.263
and invited me
to dinner tonight.

15:16.263 --> 15:18.134
That's nice, right?

15:18.134 --> 15:20.963
It's just, we were taking
things slow for a while,

15:20.963 --> 15:24.532
but now it feels like
he wants to speed things up.

15:24.532 --> 15:26.316
Well, just come clean
with him.

15:26.316 --> 15:28.014
Tell him you're not looking
for anything serious,

15:28.014 --> 15:30.712
and that way,
there's no misunderstandings.

15:34.498 --> 15:36.674
I'm on at Molly's tonight.

15:36.674 --> 15:37.980
I'm gonna head
straight to the bar,

15:37.980 --> 15:41.375
so I'll be home late.

15:41.375 --> 15:44.726
I'm gonna stay in.
I have paperwork.

15:44.726 --> 15:46.815
Good thing
we brought both cars.

15:49.861 --> 15:52.255
Trouble in paradise?

15:52.255 --> 15:53.430
Looks like it.

15:56.738 --> 15:58.609
Mom, Skyler doesn't
wanna come over,

15:58.609 --> 16:00.568
and I swear it's
because Max talks to her

16:00.568 --> 16:01.786
every time she's here.

16:01.786 --> 16:02.918
That is such a lie.

16:02.918 --> 16:04.180
I have a girlfriend.

16:04.180 --> 16:05.486
Yeah, we know.

16:05.486 --> 16:06.878
It's all you ever talk about.

16:06.878 --> 16:08.445
What's this?

16:08.445 --> 16:09.881
Thai food.

16:09.881 --> 16:11.361
Max, don't put your hands
all over it.

16:11.361 --> 16:13.624
No offense,
but this looks disgusting.

16:13.624 --> 16:15.104
Hey, knock it off.

16:15.104 --> 16:17.933
Help your mom with the bowls.

16:21.806 --> 16:24.505
Why do they call it
Thai food?

16:24.505 --> 16:26.028
Can I make mac and cheese?

16:26.028 --> 16:28.422
No, you're eating this.

16:33.079 --> 16:34.994
Lee Henry, Luke!

16:34.994 --> 16:36.386
Everybody get in here.

16:36.386 --> 16:37.735
Sit down.

16:40.129 --> 16:41.739
Sit down.

16:41.739 --> 16:42.914
All right.

16:46.092 --> 16:49.269
We got some stuff
to talk about.

16:49.269 --> 16:52.968
Um, you know,
your mom is going in

16:52.968 --> 16:56.363
for a procedure tomorrow
at the hospital.

16:56.363 --> 17:00.062
And we didn't
wanna tell you what for

17:00.062 --> 17:04.327
because we did not want you
to worry.

17:04.327 --> 17:09.811
But we wanted you to know why
I'm a little extra stressed.

17:12.248 --> 17:16.078
I have a tumor in my lung.

17:16.078 --> 17:19.125
And the doctors
need to remove it

17:19.125 --> 17:22.476
to keep it from spreading
to other parts of my body.

17:22.476 --> 17:25.479
Tumor? Like cancer?

17:27.350 --> 17:28.960
Yes.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.527
It is cancer.

17:30.527 --> 17:33.791
But hopefully,
they've caught it early enough,

17:33.791 --> 17:35.967
and it's nothing serious.

17:35.967 --> 17:38.361
What if they didn't?

17:38.361 --> 17:40.755
Jake Logan's dad
got pancreatic cancer,

17:40.755 --> 17:41.930
and a month later--

17:41.930 --> 17:43.975
Hey.

17:43.975 --> 17:46.456
Mom's gonna be okay.

17:46.456 --> 17:47.805
All right?

17:47.805 --> 17:50.286
Us Herrmanns, we're tough.

17:50.286 --> 17:52.071
Yeah?

17:52.071 --> 17:54.421
We always pull through, right?

18:00.862 --> 18:02.907
Oh.

18:02.907 --> 18:08.130
Hey.

18:08.130 --> 18:11.655
Hey, I'm going to be okay,
sweet boy.

18:11.655 --> 18:13.396
Just like Dad said.

18:16.051 --> 18:17.922
I promise.

18:20.403 --> 18:22.057
Okay?

18:32.459 --> 18:34.765
- Here you go, Capp.
- Thanks.

18:34.765 --> 18:37.507
Oh, man, those drills
did a number on my legs.

18:37.507 --> 18:39.161
My arms are killing me too.

18:39.161 --> 18:41.120
Severide really put you guys
through the wringer.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.556
He was in a mood.

18:42.556 --> 18:44.123
Yeah, because of
that call last shift.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.907
The one where
my lieutenant had a plan

18:45.907 --> 18:48.736
for saving the victim without
blowing us all to pieces?

18:48.736 --> 18:50.259
Severide knew
what he was doing.

18:50.259 --> 18:51.913
We made the save scratch free,
and in record time.

18:51.913 --> 18:53.480
Mm-hmm.

18:53.480 --> 18:54.829
Not sure what the point
of setting a record is

18:54.829 --> 18:56.352
if no one's alive to see it.

18:56.352 --> 18:59.921
Uh, I think in this case,
the victim would disagree.

18:59.921 --> 19:02.706
Victim or nut job?
Kidd made the right call.

19:02.706 --> 19:04.360
They'll tell him what
he was capable of.

19:04.360 --> 19:05.535
Doesn't matter, Carver.

19:05.535 --> 19:07.537
It was a Squad scene.

19:07.537 --> 19:10.279
Uh, what's going on
with them?

19:10.279 --> 19:13.891
Oh, every 11 years or so,

19:13.891 --> 19:15.937
Squad and Truck have it out
with each other.

19:15.937 --> 19:18.461
It's the natural order
of things,

19:18.461 --> 19:21.551
like a pride of lions
vying to be king.

19:21.551 --> 19:23.162
How does it end?

19:23.162 --> 19:26.208
Well, last time,

19:26.208 --> 19:29.211
Casey cooked us corned beef.

19:29.211 --> 19:31.082
Like I said, he was right.

19:31.082 --> 19:32.562
Yeah, but he couldn't know
for sure.

19:32.562 --> 19:33.737
That's the point.

19:33.737 --> 19:36.087
Hey, knock it off!

19:36.087 --> 19:37.263
All right?

19:37.263 --> 19:39.352
This is between lieutenants.

19:39.352 --> 19:40.527
Okay?

19:40.527 --> 19:41.963
The rest of you,
just stay out of it.

19:49.144 --> 19:51.146
So did I tell you that
the guy who lent me the rabbit

19:51.146 --> 19:53.148
is moving away?

19:53.148 --> 19:55.019
One trick I had down cold.

19:55.019 --> 19:56.586
Oh, no.

19:56.586 --> 19:58.327
What are you gonna do?

19:58.327 --> 19:59.372
You're laughing
at my tragedy.

19:59.372 --> 20:01.025
Oh, no, it's a crisis.

20:01.025 --> 20:03.289
I get it.

20:03.289 --> 20:04.986
Thing is,
I have a neighbor

20:04.986 --> 20:06.814
who has chickens
in his backyard.

20:06.814 --> 20:08.772
Oh, so you're gonna pull
a chicken out of the hat.

20:08.772 --> 20:10.600
When you say it like that,
it sounds ridiculous.

20:13.603 --> 20:14.909
No rush.

20:14.909 --> 20:16.040
I'll take this
when you're ready.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.955
Hmm, hold on.

20:17.955 --> 20:19.435
Let's split it.
- No way.

20:19.435 --> 20:23.352
I owe you one for your help
at the hospital yesterday.

20:23.352 --> 20:26.050
No, no, you don't.

20:26.050 --> 20:27.965
But thank you.

20:32.187 --> 20:33.144
Dylan...

20:35.103 --> 20:37.061
I really like hanging out
with you.

20:37.061 --> 20:38.628
Uh-oh.

20:38.628 --> 20:40.717
No, no, it's--
it's not uh-oh.

20:40.717 --> 20:44.199
Um, you're a lot of fun
and a really great guy.

20:44.199 --> 20:47.507
But the thing is, I'm--

20:47.507 --> 20:51.511
right now, I'm not looking
for anything super serious.

20:53.817 --> 20:58.039
If it's okay, I'd like
to keep things casual.

20:58.039 --> 21:00.171
Oh.

21:00.171 --> 21:02.304
Yeah, sure.

21:02.304 --> 21:04.698
Phew, I thought you were
breaking up with me.

21:04.698 --> 21:06.352
Oh, no. No.

21:06.352 --> 21:08.571
We're casual,
just having fun.

21:08.571 --> 21:09.703
Yes.

21:09.703 --> 21:11.313
I'm cool with that.

21:11.313 --> 21:12.575
Good.

21:12.575 --> 21:14.534
Great, cool.

21:18.886 --> 21:20.061
You know,
a firefighter actually

21:20.061 --> 21:21.541
has a lot of tools
at his disposal,

21:21.541 --> 21:24.283
not just axes and fire hoses.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.285
There's the jaws,
there's the chainsaw,

21:26.285 --> 21:31.333
the pry bars, Halligans,
ropes, and the ladders.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.030
And that's just on the truck.

21:33.030 --> 21:34.945
- Amazing.
- Yeah, I guess.

21:34.945 --> 21:36.947
I don't think a lot about it,
but that's the point.

21:36.947 --> 21:39.298
Everything's automatic
when you're on call.

21:42.170 --> 21:43.389
Damn.

21:43.389 --> 21:46.827
I've had some practice
with the real thing.

21:46.827 --> 21:49.220
I am so glad
that you DM'd me.

21:49.220 --> 21:52.528
I put it out into the universe,
and the universe answered.

21:52.528 --> 21:54.138
Totally. Another pilsner?

21:54.138 --> 21:55.923
- Yes, please.
- Give me two more.

21:55.923 --> 21:58.360
Uh, before we get
any further, though,

21:58.360 --> 22:01.581
I have an important question
to ask you.

22:01.581 --> 22:03.365
Shoot.

22:03.365 --> 22:05.106
Cubs or a Sox fan?

22:06.412 --> 22:09.066
Please.

22:09.066 --> 22:09.937
Cubs all the way.

22:09.937 --> 22:12.200
Oh, that is such a relief.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.071
My dad works
in the front office,

22:14.071 --> 22:17.074
so he would absolutely kill me
if I dated a Sox fan.

22:17.074 --> 22:19.686
- Your dad works for the Cubs?
- Yeah.

22:19.686 --> 22:21.296
Oh, I almost forgot.

22:23.342 --> 22:26.040
You left this
at the scene of the fire.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.520
Oh.

22:27.520 --> 22:30.523
I'm so glad I get to return
it to its rightful owner.

22:30.523 --> 22:32.263
Right, my glove.

22:32.263 --> 22:33.308
Thanks.

22:45.973 --> 22:47.757
You're home early.

22:47.757 --> 22:49.933
Yeah, it was
a pretty slow night.

22:49.933 --> 22:52.196
Game's on.
Second period's about to start.

22:52.196 --> 22:54.764
I cannot stop thinking
about what you said

22:54.764 --> 22:56.505
last shift at the firehouse.

22:56.505 --> 22:58.681
- Oh, come on, look.
- Let me finish.

22:58.681 --> 23:00.074
You were right.

23:00.074 --> 23:01.510
I acted the way
that I did on the call

23:01.510 --> 23:03.512
because you are my husband.

23:03.512 --> 23:06.167
You are not any other
lieutenant or firefighter,

23:06.167 --> 23:09.736
and only you know what I went
through at that RPG incident

23:09.736 --> 23:12.826
and how it affected me.

23:12.826 --> 23:16.699
And that still
didn't seem to matter.

23:16.699 --> 23:19.006
So I can't compartmentalize
like you do.

23:19.006 --> 23:21.748
I can't act like a robot
and turn off my emotions

23:21.748 --> 23:23.402
and treat you
like you were anyone else

23:23.402 --> 23:25.012
because you are not
anyone else to me.

23:25.012 --> 23:27.362
And if that is a problem,

23:27.362 --> 23:31.453
then maybe
we shouldn't work together.

23:31.453 --> 23:33.673
Maybe we should put in
for different shifts.

23:48.209 --> 23:49.645
Once we get in there,
check out the margins,

23:49.645 --> 23:51.081
see what we're dealing with,

23:51.081 --> 23:52.866
we'll be able to tell
what kind of cancer we have

23:52.866 --> 23:54.868
and if it has spread.

23:54.868 --> 23:58.132
Then we'll do our best
to remove it.

23:58.132 --> 24:00.569
How long is it gonna take?

24:00.569 --> 24:03.833
Well, we really won't know
until we get a good look.

24:03.833 --> 24:06.488
It could be several hours.

24:06.488 --> 24:08.751
They're ready for you
in the OR, Dr. Elliman.

24:08.751 --> 24:10.492
Thank you.

24:10.492 --> 24:12.015
Shall we?
- Yeah.

24:14.757 --> 24:17.412
Hey. I'll help pull my girl.

24:23.505 --> 24:26.813
Don't forget, Annabelle has
her piano lesson tomorrow,

24:26.813 --> 24:28.728
and the kids will
need money for lunch.

24:28.728 --> 24:31.078
I know, I got Lee Henry
on it, all right?

24:31.078 --> 24:33.646
Everything in the house
is taken care of.

24:33.646 --> 24:35.256
I promise you.

24:40.000 --> 24:45.484
I will be waiting right here
the whole time.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.137
Try not to worry too much.

24:47.137 --> 24:48.138
Me?

24:48.138 --> 24:50.706
No, never.

24:57.539 --> 24:58.497
Yeah.

26:09.655 --> 26:11.700
The glove was Mizgorski's
from first shift.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.963
He probably responded to one
of the fires at Kayla's store.

26:13.963 --> 26:16.009
Why does this place
have so many calls?

26:16.009 --> 26:17.314
They were having
electrical issues.

26:17.314 --> 26:18.402
They figured it out now.

26:18.402 --> 26:19.490
Well, no harm, no foul.

26:19.490 --> 26:20.840
Mizgorski's married,

26:20.840 --> 26:22.145
and you and Kayla
have a connection.

26:22.145 --> 26:23.407
That's what counts.

26:23.407 --> 26:24.626
- Yes, that's what I thought.
- Yeah.

26:24.626 --> 26:26.541
I don't know,
after everything

26:26.541 --> 26:28.412
that went down between
Herrmann's niece and you,

26:28.412 --> 26:29.979
do you really wanna start
another relationship

26:29.979 --> 26:31.546
with a lie?

26:31.546 --> 26:33.635
I mean, more of a funny
misunderstanding, right?

26:33.635 --> 26:35.506
You should come clean.

26:35.506 --> 26:37.204
I took Violet's advice
and laid it out

26:37.204 --> 26:38.509
honestly for Dylan last night.

26:38.509 --> 26:40.990
It actually went really well.

26:40.990 --> 26:42.513
Okay, I'll tell her.

26:42.513 --> 26:45.647
Don't overthink it.
Just give her the truth.

26:45.647 --> 26:48.258
Hey, I have an idea
I wanted to run by you.

26:48.258 --> 26:50.173
- Yeah.
- Yeah, come on.

26:50.173 --> 26:53.742
Say what you will about
summers in San Francisco,

26:53.742 --> 26:56.440
but the coldest winter
I ever spent

26:56.440 --> 27:00.575
was right here
in Chicago, 1985.

27:00.575 --> 27:01.881
I wasn't even born yet.

27:01.881 --> 27:04.623
Temperatures dropped
to 27 below.

27:04.623 --> 27:07.582
At that degree, it's not
the cold that kills you.

27:07.582 --> 27:08.714
It's the wind.

27:08.714 --> 27:10.324
Hey, I'm using that.

27:10.324 --> 27:11.717
Okay.

27:11.717 --> 27:13.196
We're almost done
topping off our truck.

27:13.196 --> 27:14.589
Can't you wait?
- Sure.

27:14.589 --> 27:16.417
Once Truck gets its pike poles

27:16.417 --> 27:18.027
off of our side
of the ap floor.

27:18.027 --> 27:20.073
We have sides
of the ap floor now?

27:20.073 --> 27:22.728
Come on, come on, it's too
early to get into that again.

27:22.728 --> 27:24.991
Hey, hey, look, no one is
getting into anything, okay?

27:24.991 --> 27:26.688
It's just a little respect
for the space

27:26.688 --> 27:28.385
would be appreciated.

27:28.385 --> 27:30.126
We're just trying
to work here.

27:30.126 --> 27:31.475
And we're not?

27:31.475 --> 27:33.390
Oh, 81 has always been
the most raggedy rig.

27:33.390 --> 27:35.044
Trust me, I know.
I used to drive it.

27:35.044 --> 27:36.132
Enough!

27:42.356 --> 27:43.574
Get back to work.

27:43.574 --> 27:45.141
Morning briefing
is in 15 minutes.

27:45.141 --> 27:47.491
Get your attitudes in order.

27:49.319 --> 27:52.758
Kylie, please find
Lieutenants Kidd and Severide,

27:52.758 --> 27:55.238
have them report
to my office immediately.

27:55.238 --> 27:57.719
On it, Chief.

27:57.719 --> 27:59.112
It doesn't give me
great pleasure

27:59.112 --> 28:01.767
to have the two of you
in front of me right now.

28:01.767 --> 28:05.292
I have looked the other way
as you have worked together

28:05.292 --> 28:07.686
while carrying
on a relationship

28:07.686 --> 28:11.167
in the same firehouse.

28:12.995 --> 28:15.432
I'm afraid that whatever's
going on between you

28:15.432 --> 28:17.957
in your home life
has now spilled over

28:17.957 --> 28:21.090
into my firehouse.

28:21.090 --> 28:23.049
Your units,

28:23.049 --> 28:24.615
they're at each other's
throats.

28:24.615 --> 28:26.835
You need to fix it.

28:26.835 --> 28:31.927
I can't and I won't let issues
from outside of 51

28:31.927 --> 28:34.408
jeopardize the successful
operation of the team

28:34.408 --> 28:35.931
that's inside of it.

28:38.499 --> 28:40.631
So figure it out!

28:40.631 --> 28:44.331
Make it right
by the end of shift.

28:44.331 --> 28:48.204
Yes, Chief.

28:56.038 --> 28:57.474
We have to talk this out.

28:57.474 --> 28:59.520
You're right. Let me start.

29:02.610 --> 29:04.177
I'm not a robot.

29:05.700 --> 29:07.136
I shouldn't have said that.

29:07.136 --> 29:10.792
Stella, if I drop my guard
and let myself worry

29:10.792 --> 29:13.490
every time you're
in harm's way, I'd fall apart.

29:13.490 --> 29:15.666
If you'd seen me
at the RPG scene,

29:15.666 --> 29:20.062
you'd know I can unravel
when it comes to you.

29:20.062 --> 29:21.716
That's never happened
to me before.

29:23.500 --> 29:24.980
Really?

29:24.980 --> 29:26.242
Really.

29:26.242 --> 29:28.505
And if I let my emotions
get the best of me

29:28.505 --> 29:31.639
when we're on a call together,

29:31.639 --> 29:33.293
I'm no good to anybody.

29:41.214 --> 29:44.826
Same shift or not,

29:44.826 --> 29:48.874
the reality is, we are married.

29:48.874 --> 29:52.834
So we are always gonna take
a little bit of work home

29:52.834 --> 29:57.752
with us and a little bit
of home to work.

29:57.752 --> 30:03.410
We just have to be better
about keeping it between us.

30:05.194 --> 30:07.022
<i>Truck 81, Squad 3,
Ambo 61,</i>

30:07.022 --> 30:09.329
<i>person injured, 2550 West...</i>

30:09.329 --> 30:12.549
2550, that's the marina.
That's Bob and Cheryl's place.

30:23.125 --> 30:24.692
Lieutenant, what is this?
Boat storage?

30:24.692 --> 30:27.129
Yeah,
Severide knows the owners.

30:27.129 --> 30:29.610
He's done a lot of work
for them over the years.

30:29.610 --> 30:31.046
Tony, it's right here.

30:41.100 --> 30:42.231
Cruz.

30:42.231 --> 30:43.624
Let's go! Let's go!

30:43.624 --> 30:45.800
- All right, Gallo, with me.
- Copy.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.584
- Bob, where are you?
- Over here!

30:47.584 --> 30:49.064
Help! Kelly, hurry!

30:49.064 --> 30:51.588
It's Cheryl!
- Easy, easy. Easy.

30:51.588 --> 30:53.721
Easy. Stay still.

30:53.721 --> 30:56.463
Hey, Cheryl.

30:56.463 --> 30:57.725
Cheryl, hey.

30:57.725 --> 30:59.858
Hey. Hey, Cheryl.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.076
Hey, Cheryl. It's Kelly.

31:01.076 --> 31:03.774
Look at me. Can you breathe?

31:03.774 --> 31:05.994
It's my fault.

31:10.390 --> 31:12.131
There was a noise
like a creaking.

31:12.131 --> 31:13.697
I told her to check it out.

31:13.697 --> 31:15.482
And the jack, it just gave way.
- It's all right, Bob.

31:15.482 --> 31:17.614
Hey, Bob, we're here.
We got her.

31:17.614 --> 31:19.225
We're gonna get her. Come on.

31:19.225 --> 31:21.096
- Hey, Cheryl.
- Come on.

31:21.096 --> 31:22.750
Cheryl, let's get you out.

31:25.796 --> 31:28.930
I got it. All right.

31:28.930 --> 31:30.192
This is a tricky one.

31:30.192 --> 31:31.846
The shape of it,
overhead anchor would be best,

31:31.846 --> 31:34.457
but I don't wanna put
too much stress on the trusses.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.635
What if we use air bags
and cribbing?

31:38.635 --> 31:41.160
So we lift, we wedge
on the right side,

31:41.160 --> 31:42.901
see-saw it up
until we can pull her out.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.380
Yeah, I like it.

31:44.380 --> 31:46.121
But she's leaning too far
on the port side.

31:46.121 --> 31:47.949
We need to stabilize it.
- Okay.

31:47.949 --> 31:50.125
Hey, Cruz, can you secure
an anchor point

31:50.125 --> 31:51.170
on the stern side?

31:51.170 --> 31:52.649
I'll take care of the bow.

31:52.649 --> 31:55.914
Capp, Tony, bring in
two rope bags, stat.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.524
Mouch, Carver, I need
air bags and cribbing.

31:57.524 --> 31:59.308
Tony, you're with Cruz.

31:59.308 --> 32:01.397
Secure an anchor point.
Capp, you're with me.

32:01.397 --> 32:03.182
Help me secure
an anchor point here.

32:05.010 --> 32:05.924
All right.

32:07.751 --> 32:09.188
All right. Cribbing.
- Grab a handful.

32:09.188 --> 32:10.493
Mouch.

32:12.234 --> 32:13.888
Throw the cribbings
on either side.

32:19.502 --> 32:21.417
Reel it up. All right.

32:30.035 --> 32:33.386
Capp, Tony, we wanna
rope through the bite loop,

32:33.386 --> 32:35.779
secure it, anchor it,
stabilize it as we lift.

32:35.779 --> 32:37.607
Make sure it doesn't shift.
- Copy.

32:37.607 --> 32:39.696
Yeah.

32:39.696 --> 32:42.177
Mouch, I'm gonna
have you on controller.

32:42.177 --> 32:44.179
Gallo, Carver,
you stay on the left side

32:44.179 --> 32:45.528
for wedges and cribbing.

32:45.528 --> 32:47.356
We're almost set here.

32:47.356 --> 32:49.837
Cruz, short this side?
- Yeah.

32:49.837 --> 32:50.925
Cheryl, we got you.

32:55.060 --> 32:58.106
Okay, set?

32:58.106 --> 32:59.673
Up on blue.

33:04.330 --> 33:05.809
Hold.

33:07.333 --> 33:08.725
Set.

33:08.725 --> 33:09.813
Up on red.

33:12.033 --> 33:12.991
Little more.

33:17.517 --> 33:19.867
Hey, hold, hold.

33:19.867 --> 33:21.521
Okay, up on blue.

33:24.959 --> 33:26.830
- We're clear!
- All right, back board.

33:26.830 --> 33:28.832
Yeah.

33:28.832 --> 33:30.008
Give me that C-collar.

33:34.577 --> 33:36.536
We're gonna put this
C-collar on you, okay?

33:40.931 --> 33:43.064
One, two, three.

33:44.761 --> 33:45.849
We got you.

33:45.849 --> 33:48.026
Cheryl,
I'm right here, honey.

33:49.679 --> 33:50.680
Okay.

33:50.680 --> 33:53.553
And lift on three.
One, two, three.

33:53.553 --> 33:54.815
Are you okay?

33:56.251 --> 33:58.514
Is she gonna be okay?

33:58.514 --> 34:00.168
No visible contusions.

34:00.168 --> 34:01.865
She has a crush injury.

34:09.438 --> 34:11.266
Blood pressure's low.
Let's get her to Med.

34:11.266 --> 34:13.355
You can ride with us.

34:17.968 --> 34:19.448
Hey, you did good.

34:19.448 --> 34:22.451
You got her out fast.

34:22.451 --> 34:24.105
That was solid teamwork.

34:24.105 --> 34:26.325
Nice work.

34:26.325 --> 34:27.674
All right, guys.

34:27.674 --> 34:29.197
Squad, Truck,
let's gather up our stuff.

34:29.197 --> 34:31.634
Let's go.
- Great work, 81.

34:31.634 --> 34:32.940
Let's move out.
Nice work.

34:41.514 --> 34:43.516
- Do I smell--
- Corned beef.

34:43.516 --> 34:45.300
- Yup, Casey's recipe.
- Oh!

34:45.300 --> 34:47.302
Ritter promised to keep
an eye on it while we were out.

34:49.826 --> 34:53.395
To be honest, it was
his idea to make it.

34:58.879 --> 35:00.185
Is there something
I'm missing?

35:00.185 --> 35:01.664
It's a gesture.

35:01.664 --> 35:02.970
When Truck screws up,
they apologize.

35:02.970 --> 35:04.232
Capp! Nope.

35:04.232 --> 35:06.016
It was a joke.

35:06.016 --> 35:09.324
It is a meal to be shared
by everybody.

35:09.324 --> 35:10.760
That's all.

35:10.760 --> 35:12.675
Good one too.
- It's the best.

35:12.675 --> 35:14.764
I gotta say, Gallo,
it smells like

35:14.764 --> 35:16.592
you nailed Casey's recipe.

35:16.592 --> 35:19.029
Yeah, let's hope
it tastes like it.

35:19.029 --> 35:21.031
Passing up the rotation,
you know what I'm saying?

35:23.208 --> 35:26.298
Thank you.
- Cheers.

35:26.298 --> 35:27.647
Oh, of course.
Eat, guys, eat.

35:27.647 --> 35:28.778
I want you eating
while it's hot.

35:28.778 --> 35:29.953
Try some of them taters.

35:29.953 --> 35:31.607
Now, you know
I need extra, right?

35:39.920 --> 35:42.966
Chief.

35:42.966 --> 35:47.275
Told you I'd be here for you
if you needed anything.

35:47.275 --> 35:50.017
I figured

35:50.017 --> 35:52.367
you'd want some company
while you wait.

35:54.326 --> 35:55.892
I appreciate it.

35:55.892 --> 35:58.373
I don't know what kind
of company I'm gonna be.

35:58.373 --> 36:04.162
I've been going out of my mind
the last three hours,

36:04.162 --> 36:06.076
just the stress of it.

36:08.775 --> 36:13.562
I--I guess I'm good when I'm
doing something, you know,

36:13.562 --> 36:16.565
when there's a crisis,
you know?

36:16.565 --> 36:19.177
You are doing something.

36:19.177 --> 36:23.137
You're here with your family.

36:23.137 --> 36:24.834
I mean, just think about
all the times you have

36:24.834 --> 36:26.706
been in this waiting room.

36:26.706 --> 36:28.577
Five baby deliveries.
- Yeah.

36:28.577 --> 36:32.842
Countless close calls
on the job.

36:32.842 --> 36:35.280
And you

36:35.280 --> 36:37.847
are always the last man
to leave your post.

36:39.719 --> 36:41.982
I mean, hell,
I'm surprised there isn't

36:41.982 --> 36:44.593
a section in this area
with your damn name on it.

36:50.512 --> 36:53.776
You.

36:53.776 --> 36:57.780
Annabelle's, you know,
her delivery,

36:57.780 --> 37:03.525
Cindy was in labor
for 19 hours.

37:03.525 --> 37:05.788
I survived on nothing but

37:05.788 --> 37:08.443
vending machine
Sno Balls and Sanka.

37:10.445 --> 37:12.317
I don't know.

37:12.317 --> 37:15.537
But, man. Thank you.

37:24.285 --> 37:26.592
Is there a job for giving out
amazing dating advice?

37:26.592 --> 37:28.333
Because I'm good at it.

37:28.333 --> 37:29.986
I can make a fortune.

37:29.986 --> 37:34.252
It does seem like you've
outdone yourself this time.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.950
It's so cool to hang out
at a firefighter bar.

37:36.950 --> 37:39.474
I've never dated
a real-life hero before.

37:39.474 --> 37:42.216
Yeah, about that, um,

37:42.216 --> 37:43.348
I wanna be truthful with you

37:43.348 --> 37:44.871
because I recently
got out of a thing

37:44.871 --> 37:48.440
with my lieutenant's niece,
which, initially,

37:48.440 --> 37:49.919
I didn't know
she was his niece, but--

37:49.919 --> 37:51.138
Neon Trees is in town
in a couple of weeks.

37:51.138 --> 37:52.313
You wanna go?

37:52.313 --> 37:54.054
Yeah.

37:54.054 --> 37:55.185
No pressure.

37:55.185 --> 37:58.101
Sylvie, I wasn't
honest with you

37:58.101 --> 38:01.104
the other night
when I said I was fine

38:01.104 --> 38:03.368
with just casual dating.

38:03.368 --> 38:05.413
- Oh.
- Uh-oh.

38:05.413 --> 38:07.023
And it made things
really weird for me at work

38:07.023 --> 38:08.895
because Herrmann's
basically one of my bosses,

38:08.895 --> 38:10.984
and he needs to trust me.

38:10.984 --> 38:12.942
So I want you to know that even
though we really hit it off

38:12.942 --> 38:15.205
and the actual firefighter
that saved you was married,

38:15.205 --> 38:17.773
um, that I'm not
the owner of the glove

38:17.773 --> 38:19.645
you found on the scene.

38:19.645 --> 38:22.256
You slept with your
lieutenant's niece?

38:22.256 --> 38:24.127
Uh...

38:24.127 --> 38:25.172
Problem is...

38:27.348 --> 38:29.829
I really like you.

38:29.829 --> 38:33.528
And I was hoping that
this was going somewhere.

38:33.528 --> 38:34.703
No, no, no, no.

38:34.703 --> 38:37.532
Why is he--
- No.

38:37.532 --> 38:38.751
She's going too.

38:38.751 --> 38:41.536
Why is she going?

38:41.536 --> 38:43.016
What just happened?

38:44.931 --> 38:46.498
Okay.
- Okay.

38:46.498 --> 38:48.151
- No, please stay.
- Ugh.

38:48.151 --> 38:49.501
Oh, that was a
disaster, Violet.

38:49.501 --> 38:50.806
So that went
straight to hell.

38:50.806 --> 38:52.286
I just blew a lifetime
of free Cubs tickets.

38:52.286 --> 38:53.766
Everything was going fine.

38:53.766 --> 38:55.550
Why did I have to make
a big deal about casual?

38:55.550 --> 38:56.899
Cubs tickets for life.

38:56.899 --> 38:58.553
Oh, I love you,
but you didn't...

39:05.647 --> 39:07.170
Stella?

39:13.307 --> 39:14.395
Hey?

39:14.395 --> 39:15.657
Hi.

39:17.833 --> 39:19.748
Remember how I said
we'd always bring

39:19.748 --> 39:22.447
a little bit of work home?

39:22.447 --> 39:25.363
Well, tonight, it's this.

39:28.496 --> 39:30.280
Your lucky coat.

39:58.004 --> 39:59.832
Hey, this is him.

40:02.530 --> 40:05.794
How--how'd it go?
Is everything--everything okay?

40:05.794 --> 40:07.361
Cindy's doing well.

40:07.361 --> 40:09.755
It'll be a little while before
she's out of the sedation.

40:09.755 --> 40:12.279
Then you can see her.

40:12.279 --> 40:14.324
Thank God.

40:14.324 --> 40:16.152
Why don't you walk with me?
We can talk more.

40:16.152 --> 40:17.371
Sure.

40:25.205 --> 40:28.077
Unfortunately, we weren't
able to get the margins clean.

40:30.210 --> 40:33.126
What do you mean?
But you said Cindy's good.

40:33.126 --> 40:34.823
She made it through
the surgery well,

40:34.823 --> 40:36.999
but we weren't able
to get all the cancer out.

40:36.999 --> 40:38.827
We removed what we could,
but we found some

40:38.827 --> 40:41.308
in the lymph nodes, too,

40:41.308 --> 40:44.833
which means we have
a fight ahead of us.

40:44.833 --> 40:49.011
Next step, chemotherapy
and radiation.

40:49.011 --> 40:53.842
But, um,
we promised our kids.

40:53.842 --> 40:56.410
Hey, we got
a great team here.

40:56.410 --> 40:58.412
And we're gonna
do everything we can

40:58.412 --> 41:01.023
to help Cindy in this fight.

41:01.023 --> 41:04.418
Let's stay hopeful, okay?
