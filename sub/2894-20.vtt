WEBVTT

00:03.303 --> 00:05.137
(grunting)

00:05.139 --> 00:08.374
No more games!
Get these things off me!

00:09.442 --> 00:12.578
My own bonds have me
similarly shackled.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.046
(munching)

00:14.381 --> 00:15.614
Heh. Golden.

00:18.651 --> 00:20.119
You had enough yet, guys?

00:20.420 --> 00:24.089
I am just getting
warmed up, iron man!

00:24.091 --> 00:25.157
(grunts)

00:25.592 --> 00:27.459
Thor: The bonds.
Even stronger?

00:27.761 --> 00:29.061
Impossible!

00:29.063 --> 00:31.630
When invented by me? Possible.

00:32.064 --> 00:34.166
Your lightning strengthened
the ionic bonds.

00:34.168 --> 00:36.068
Now? You'll never get out.

00:36.070 --> 00:37.536
How can you eat right now?

00:37.538 --> 00:39.204
Are you kidding?
This is the only time

00:39.206 --> 00:41.040
Hulk isn't hogging
all the food.

00:41.042 --> 00:43.375
Are you eating my popcorn?

00:43.643 --> 00:46.078
And your cereal.
And your pickles.

00:47.113 --> 00:48.347
(growls)

00:48.748 --> 00:50.149
Uh-oh.

00:51.718 --> 00:54.820
Tony, you said they couldn't
crack the new safety shield.

00:55.722 --> 00:58.223
I also said it was
an experiment.

00:58.225 --> 01:02.161
The shackles of stark
are no match for
the son of odin!

01:02.163 --> 01:06.532
Iron man: You know
he's worked up when he starts
talking about his dad.

01:06.534 --> 01:07.666
Thor, don't!

01:11.738 --> 01:13.539
(screaming)

01:18.144 --> 01:19.711
(glass breaking)

01:20.747 --> 01:22.815
(coughing)
is everyone all right?

01:23.283 --> 01:26.418
Oh, less broken than
tony's unbreakable shield.

01:26.820 --> 01:29.188
Thor, cap told you not to...

01:29.190 --> 01:32.091
(coughing)
I did stay my hand, stark.

01:32.093 --> 01:33.492
(growling)

01:33.726 --> 01:36.095
Hammer-brains fried hulk!

01:36.097 --> 01:38.263
I did no such thing,
you foul-tempered oaf!

01:38.265 --> 01:40.732
I'll show you
foul-tempered!

01:40.734 --> 01:42.167
(groaning)

01:42.169 --> 01:43.769
(hawkeye laughing)

01:43.771 --> 01:46.405
Hey, I was
gonna post that!

01:46.539 --> 01:47.706
Oops.

01:48.441 --> 01:49.775
Uh... Thor?

01:49.777 --> 01:51.110
(grunting)

01:51.112 --> 01:52.311
Thor.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.116
Hulk kick!

01:57.118 --> 02:00.452
Your feet are as
offensively stenched
as your breath.

02:00.753 --> 02:03.622
Odin: What is the meaning
of this foolishness?

02:07.727 --> 02:09.294
Uh-oh. Busted.

02:09.295 --> 02:11.897
Odin. Why are you here?

02:12.365 --> 02:14.333
I am here
for you, son.

02:14.701 --> 02:18.504
You are to come back
to asgard, never
to return again.

02:19.372 --> 02:20.439
(gasps)

02:22.000 --> 02:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:32.852 --> 02:34.653
Thor: Return? Impossible.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.856
You hate seeing thor fight
with his old man
as much as I do?

02:38.191 --> 02:41.460
Not as much as I'd hate
not to have thor
fighting beside us.

02:41.928 --> 02:43.629
We can't afford to lose
our heaviest hitter.

02:43.631 --> 02:44.696
(growling)

02:44.698 --> 02:46.932
One of our heaviest hitters.

02:46.934 --> 02:47.866
Off.

02:49.869 --> 02:50.936
(growling)

02:50.938 --> 02:53.338
(gulping) and done.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.774
Thor: I appreciate your
request, father,

02:55.776 --> 02:58.477
But my place is...
It was no request, thor.

02:58.479 --> 03:00.679
Your time
playing here is over.

03:00.914 --> 03:04.816
Playing? Whatever
you may think,
earth is rife with threats.

03:04.818 --> 03:07.352
Asgard has abundant threats.

03:07.720 --> 03:09.821
And you are asgard born.

03:10.223 --> 03:12.591
Why would you choose
this realm over your own?

03:12.593 --> 03:14.726
These are valiant warriors.

03:14.728 --> 03:17.196
Perhaps the most valiant
I have ever known.

03:17.198 --> 03:18.931
(hulk growls)
hawkeye: You're overreacting!

03:18.933 --> 03:21.533
It was just popcorn!
Come on!

03:21.535 --> 03:23.235
Valiant indeed.

03:23.237 --> 03:25.904
Odin, is it?
Tony stark. Pleasure.

03:25.906 --> 03:27.906
Who are you to approach me?

03:27.908 --> 03:29.908
Just the worlds
most eligible bachelor

03:29.910 --> 03:31.543
And billionaire
philanthropist.

03:31.545 --> 03:32.911
Oh, brother.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.646
What? It impresses
most people.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.316
Thor's right.
We need him here.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.884
He's the backbone
of our team.

03:38.886 --> 03:41.587
Is that why you
restrain him thus?

03:41.589 --> 03:44.690
Those? Just a little
invention of mine.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.258
Flux gain shackles.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.927
Uh, don't be too hard
on him, mr. Odin, sir.

03:48.929 --> 03:51.263
No one in any realm
can remove those.

03:51.265 --> 03:52.497
No one?

03:52.499 --> 03:53.565
(pulsating)

03:59.372 --> 04:01.873
Or I could be wrong,
and two months
of engineering

04:01.875 --> 04:03.342
Just went down the drain.

04:03.643 --> 04:05.510
Father. Hear my words.

04:05.512 --> 04:06.712
Earth...
Is insignificant

04:06.714 --> 04:09.014
Where the matters
of gods are concerned.

04:09.449 --> 04:13.252
If their strongest can't best
a midgard servant
or a destroyer,

04:13.254 --> 04:15.287
Then they deserve
their demise.

04:15.521 --> 04:17.255
You talk too much!

04:17.257 --> 04:18.523
(yells)

04:18.992 --> 04:20.259
What?

04:20.261 --> 04:22.561
What... Did you...

04:22.563 --> 04:23.895
Just do?

04:23.897 --> 04:26.832
Well, at least I have
my s.H.I.E.L.D. Back-up job.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.367
It was nice
knowing you guys.

04:28.534 --> 04:29.935
Monster!

04:30.937 --> 04:33.839
I am the odinson!
He is my father!

04:33.841 --> 04:35.707
You will pay for that!
(roars)

04:36.309 --> 04:38.677
(odin laughs)

04:39.279 --> 04:42.914
I haven't been hit like that
since facing off against
the fire-demon surtur!

04:43.683 --> 04:45.851
I have underestimated
you, creature.

04:45.985 --> 04:49.354
Perhaps we should try again
with proper introductions.

04:49.356 --> 04:51.290
I am odin, son of bor.

04:52.925 --> 04:55.794
Bor? Oh, there's gotta be
a joke in there, somewhere.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.863
Odin, meet captain america.

04:57.865 --> 05:00.599
Falcon. Hawkeye.
Black widow.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.934
And I believe you've
already met hulk's fist.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.336
Indeed.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.906
I found respect
in our meeting,
one called hulk.

05:08.074 --> 05:10.876
Uh, hulk doesn't hug.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.878
But does he feast?

05:12.880 --> 05:14.046
Take me to
the hall of dining

05:14.048 --> 05:16.948
While I decide how
to properly test you all.

05:17.583 --> 05:21.386
Your stomach can
continue to rumble
until we clear this matter.

05:22.855 --> 05:25.057
In you beats the heart
of a leader born,

05:25.658 --> 05:27.959
But I look to these
luxuries surrounding you,

05:28.328 --> 05:30.896
And I fear
you have grown soft.

05:31.431 --> 05:33.865
Soft? Stay and see.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.735
We avengers fight
great battles daily!

05:36.969 --> 05:38.804
If this is not evident
come the morn,

05:38.806 --> 05:41.873
I shall return to asgard
with you for good.

05:43.109 --> 05:44.843
I accept your offer.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.945
I will observe one cycle.

05:47.580 --> 05:49.581
But first, we feast.

05:49.583 --> 05:50.816
(computer beeping)

05:50.818 --> 05:53.051
What's the warning, jarvis?

05:53.053 --> 05:55.053
Jarvis: <i> It appears that</i>
<i>the energy creature zzzax</i>

05:55.055 --> 05:57.789
<i>Has besieged the united</i>
<i>nations building, sir.</i>

05:57.925 --> 06:02.728
Why delay your chance
to prove yourselves
to me in great battle?

06:03.463 --> 06:05.097
Heimdall! Portal!

06:05.798 --> 06:08.834
Portal?
I do not do portals.

06:24.484 --> 06:26.051
(groaning)

06:27.653 --> 06:29.888
That is why
I don't do portals.

06:30.823 --> 06:32.023
Where's my... Oh!

06:32.025 --> 06:34.426
Black widow: Get off of me!

06:34.927 --> 06:36.428
(groaning)

06:36.430 --> 06:38.563
Where's zzzax?
(electricity crackling)

06:38.565 --> 06:39.998
Behind you!

06:40.566 --> 06:42.033
(hulk roaring)

06:45.671 --> 06:46.905
The threat
I'm impressed by.

06:47.573 --> 06:50.842
Your response to it,
far less so.

06:50.844 --> 06:53.712
Maybe if you hadn't
absconded with us, we would...

06:53.714 --> 06:56.181
Less fighting with pop.
More fighting with crackle.

06:56.983 --> 06:58.049
(grunting)

06:59.786 --> 07:03.088
Tony! Whatever
this zzzax thing is,
he's eating my stings.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.956
Hulk confronted it
before, widow.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.792
It consumes energy.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.593
Overfeeding it is the key.

07:10.163 --> 07:12.431
Chew on this, spark plug.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.140
(grunts)

07:23.943 --> 07:27.579
What kind of creature
is not felled
by asgardian steel?

07:28.981 --> 07:30.215
No worries.

07:30.217 --> 07:31.983
Where asgard fails,

07:31.985 --> 07:33.919
Hulk's fists win!

07:36.122 --> 07:38.023
(hulk screaming)

07:38.025 --> 07:39.891
(sighing)

07:40.026 --> 07:42.994
The man of iron said
the beast feasts on energy.

07:43.162 --> 07:45.664
So energy he shall have!

07:45.898 --> 07:46.965
Uh-oh.

07:55.074 --> 07:57.909
Lucky for you, odin is here!

08:01.013 --> 08:02.681
The odinforce?

08:02.683 --> 08:03.949
On midgard?

08:04.250 --> 08:07.052
So... You've finally
ventured away

08:07.054 --> 08:08.954
From the security of asgard.

08:09.856 --> 08:11.056
Perfect.

08:13.526 --> 08:15.093
What have you done?

08:15.095 --> 08:17.095
Saved the day, t'would seem.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.964
This was not your fight!

08:18.966 --> 08:20.699
I should have
left it to them?

08:21.100 --> 08:22.901
(groans)

08:23.703 --> 08:26.571
I have seen this realm's
mightiest warriors

08:26.573 --> 08:28.173
Prank and play like children.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.976
What I have not seen
are displays of heroism

08:30.978 --> 08:33.078
And bravery as you promised!

08:33.080 --> 08:35.145
Because you thrust us
into this siege

08:35.148 --> 08:36.948
Before we had
our wits about us

08:36.950 --> 08:39.650
And then usurped us
once we had them back!

08:39.986 --> 08:43.889
Then let me provide you
with a clear battlefield

08:43.890 --> 08:45.524
And a worthy opponent!

08:45.526 --> 08:47.259
Heimdall! Portals now!

08:50.029 --> 08:51.263
Not again...

08:51.697 --> 08:53.298
(citizens murmur)

08:57.904 --> 08:59.571
Central park?

08:59.573 --> 09:01.706
Couldn't we have just
taken the 6 train?

09:01.941 --> 09:03.708
(wind whooshing)

09:03.710 --> 09:05.710
I have a bad feeling
about this.

09:05.945 --> 09:08.780
Falcon,
perimeter this park.
No civilians.

09:08.948 --> 09:10.115
On it!

09:13.219 --> 09:15.554
Welcome to midgard, odin.

09:15.821 --> 09:19.157
I promise you,
my revenge shall be slow.

09:19.959 --> 09:21.660
Avengers!

09:21.662 --> 09:24.930
My son believes you warriors
worthy of his approval.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.698
Prove yourselves
worthy of mine.

09:29.936 --> 09:31.236
Or what?

09:31.238 --> 09:33.838
Or I must leave forever.

09:37.043 --> 09:38.877
Odin: Have at thee!

09:40.313 --> 09:42.147
(all groan)

09:44.216 --> 09:47.953
Odin: Let us decide
a warriors mettle
as we do in asgard!

09:48.187 --> 09:49.955
Through the sport of combat!

09:49.957 --> 09:52.324
Who will be the first
to taste my power?

09:52.925 --> 09:55.193
Taste? I'm still hungry!

09:55.195 --> 09:58.096
Then dine on
the staff of gungnir!

09:58.631 --> 10:00.031
If it is battle odin wants,

10:00.033 --> 10:02.000
It is battle
odin shall have.

10:02.168 --> 10:03.935
Guys, we can just rush in...

10:03.937 --> 10:05.136
Avengers, assemble!

10:05.138 --> 10:06.938
Rush in like children.

10:10.776 --> 10:13.078
Prove it to me
in your actions, son!

10:13.080 --> 10:15.780
You take the place
of your so-called team

10:15.782 --> 10:17.749
To hide their weakness!

10:20.686 --> 10:22.621
Iron man: Wrong.
We've got his back.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.623
And we're happy
to attack yours.

10:26.025 --> 10:27.359
(groaning)

10:29.629 --> 10:33.198
(scoffs) there is a fighting
spirit in you after all.

10:33.766 --> 10:34.933
Stand down, odin!

10:34.935 --> 10:37.135
We can't risk injuring
innocent people here.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.070
A small price
to pay for truth!

10:39.305 --> 10:42.073
Captain america: Pour it on,
avengers! Hold him!

10:47.413 --> 10:48.680
(grunting)

10:54.021 --> 10:57.155
Man, you take
heavy-handed parenting

10:57.157 --> 10:58.957
To a whole new level.

10:58.959 --> 11:01.893
You are brave
for one so small!

11:01.895 --> 11:03.294
(thudding)

11:03.296 --> 11:07.298
Yeah, well, hearing
the sound of an incoming
gamma bomb doesn't hurt.

11:07.300 --> 11:10.368
What took you so long,
hulk? Hulk?

11:10.370 --> 11:12.771
It cannot be.
(mangog roars)

11:12.972 --> 11:14.039
(grunts)

11:16.175 --> 11:19.744
May the mightiest spires
of asgard quiver!

11:19.979 --> 11:21.713
For the wrath of mangog

11:21.715 --> 11:24.349
Has finally returned
for your wretched soul,

11:24.817 --> 11:26.851
Old man odin!

11:26.853 --> 11:27.986
(screams)

11:29.922 --> 11:32.424
Iron man: Looks like
all-father odin brought
a playmate.

11:34.326 --> 11:36.061
Nothing in
the s.H.I.E.L.D. Files.

11:36.063 --> 11:38.063
Anyone know
what a "mangog" is?

11:38.065 --> 11:39.898
Mangog? Did you say...

11:39.900 --> 11:41.166
Father!

11:41.867 --> 11:44.035
(groaning)
(roaring)

11:44.370 --> 11:46.071
(thor yelling)

11:50.776 --> 11:52.911
How could I have
been so foolish!

11:52.913 --> 11:55.013
In my haste
to retrieve you,

11:55.015 --> 11:58.416
I've played right into
that foul monster's hands!

12:00.319 --> 12:02.954
Odin, who or what
is this mangog?

12:02.956 --> 12:05.423
A cast-off. A mistake.

12:05.825 --> 12:08.093
Mangog sought
to make war with many,

12:08.095 --> 12:10.261
So I banished him
to the dark realm,

12:10.263 --> 12:12.297
Barring his entry
into asgard.

12:12.431 --> 12:13.732
(groans)

12:13.734 --> 12:15.166
I grow weak.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.402
My odinforce, draining.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.937
Treachery!

12:18.939 --> 12:22.040
I came for you unattended
by warriors of asgard,

12:22.274 --> 12:24.309
And now mangog seeks...

12:25.444 --> 12:27.145
The other eye.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.180
My sword, rungnur,

12:29.182 --> 12:31.750
Shall have it,
and, with its power,

12:31.951 --> 12:34.753
Mangog shall rule
the known realms!

12:35.421 --> 12:36.855
Odin: Rungnur.

12:37.123 --> 12:39.057
Gungnir's opposite.

12:39.059 --> 12:41.226
It feeds off my odinforce!

12:41.228 --> 12:42.460
Falcon, we're up!

12:42.462 --> 12:44.028
High and low! On it!

12:44.030 --> 12:46.030
No! This is my fight.

12:46.032 --> 12:48.032
You are in our home, father.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.201
And so this fight
belongs to me

12:50.203 --> 12:53.438
And my valiant warriors,
the avengers!

12:53.839 --> 12:55.507
You have no chance!

12:55.509 --> 12:57.242
Mangog, welcome to earth!

12:57.244 --> 12:59.077
Sorry you won't be staying.

12:59.979 --> 13:02.947
Don't let the dimensional
doggy-door
hit you on the way out!

13:02.949 --> 13:05.183
I don't like your big head!

13:06.018 --> 13:07.085
(groaning)

13:07.087 --> 13:09.120
Open wide, mangog!

13:10.356 --> 13:13.124
I hate this "gods
and monsters" stuff!

13:14.994 --> 13:16.427
(both grunt)

13:17.863 --> 13:19.998
We're not making a dent.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.803
Prepare yourself, fiend!

13:24.805 --> 13:26.471
Mjolnir thirsts!

13:26.972 --> 13:28.540
(mangog roars)

13:29.575 --> 13:32.110
And I'm still
thirsty for action!

13:34.380 --> 13:35.446
(groans)

13:35.581 --> 13:38.416
You both shall
starve for victory!

13:40.853 --> 13:42.220
Mangog!

13:42.222 --> 13:44.355
Have you come
for the odinson,

13:44.523 --> 13:46.124
Or odin himself?

13:46.126 --> 13:47.926
Away, foul one!

13:48.928 --> 13:49.994
(groans)

13:50.596 --> 13:52.263
Will you never trust me?

13:52.265 --> 13:54.232
I was well in control
of this matter!

13:54.466 --> 13:56.234
My team...
Are humans.

13:56.502 --> 13:58.269
We are much, much more!

13:58.271 --> 14:00.972
Do not question my tactics
in the field of battle!

14:00.974 --> 14:04.108
Says the one who admits
bringing this evil
here himself?

14:04.277 --> 14:09.080
Didn't odin say that this
mangog feeds off
of the odinforce?

14:09.082 --> 14:10.215
Aye.

14:10.616 --> 14:11.883
(rumbling)

14:13.385 --> 14:15.086
(roaring)

14:16.255 --> 14:18.056
Odin's beard!
My beard!

14:18.357 --> 14:20.325
So that's where
that phrase comes from.

14:20.893 --> 14:22.293
(mangog grunts)

14:26.932 --> 14:28.166
Flyboy!

14:30.437 --> 14:35.974
They're asgardians.
Everything is yelling this
or hitting that.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.308
Come, odin!

14:38.010 --> 14:39.944
Your doom awaits!

14:40.312 --> 14:42.280
Midgard, and my father,

14:42.282 --> 14:43.982
Are under my protection!

14:45.117 --> 14:49.053
Your protection
is no protection!

14:56.595 --> 14:57.662
(groans)

14:58.097 --> 14:59.464
(mangog roars)

15:00.232 --> 15:04.068
So falls the son,
so shall fall the father!

15:04.070 --> 15:07.105
While you grew
soft at home,

15:07.107 --> 15:09.340
I grew strong in my hatred!

15:09.342 --> 15:11.442
I am now...
(groans)

15:13.112 --> 15:15.280
We're not through, mongrel!

15:15.614 --> 15:16.915
Game plan?

15:16.917 --> 15:18.549
Iron man: Keep away from dad.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.318
(roaring)

15:26.292 --> 15:27.659
(groaning)

15:29.561 --> 15:31.329
Here's smoke
in your snout!

15:39.071 --> 15:40.505
You see, father?

15:40.507 --> 15:46.110
I will not
have others settle
the debts of odin's wrongs!

15:53.686 --> 15:55.954
Hawkeye: Why am I
the only one running?

15:57.222 --> 15:59.390
What has your pride wrought?

15:59.392 --> 16:01.592
It has wrought his end.

16:02.027 --> 16:04.028
You banished me, odin!

16:04.396 --> 16:06.631
But I have returned for you.

16:06.633 --> 16:09.434
An eye for an eye.

16:10.102 --> 16:12.136
We shall see, fiend!

16:12.738 --> 16:14.172
(grunting)

16:16.308 --> 16:18.076
Father! No!

16:20.112 --> 16:21.746
(roaring)

16:29.755 --> 16:32.090
Well, that was a blast.

16:32.092 --> 16:34.692
I can barely hear you
through the ringing
in my ears,

16:34.694 --> 16:37.028
But I'm betting
it wasn't as funny
as you thought it was.

16:37.030 --> 16:39.130
There is no humor in this.

16:43.602 --> 16:46.170
Finally, odin. Revenge!

16:46.172 --> 16:48.039
(cackles)

16:50.109 --> 16:51.542
Monster!

16:55.314 --> 16:57.415
What trickery
keeps me at bay?

16:57.417 --> 16:59.017
The odinforce.

16:59.585 --> 17:01.185
Mine now!

17:01.653 --> 17:03.287
(thor grunts)

17:07.226 --> 17:11.061
Finally, the eye
of odin is mine.

17:11.763 --> 17:14.298
Hawkeye: And now civilians
to worry about.

17:15.099 --> 17:17.135
Feel the power!

17:22.040 --> 17:23.508
(screaming)

17:28.380 --> 17:31.315
Mangog: This realm amuses me!

17:36.555 --> 17:38.156
We need that sword.

17:46.131 --> 17:47.365
Stop.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.167
Spare this world.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.401
I beg of you.

17:50.602 --> 17:53.371
You are pathetic
to beg, old man.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.406
Nothing can stop me now!

17:57.810 --> 17:59.710
We beg to differ!

17:59.712 --> 18:02.814
Let me show you
what the son of asgard
is made of!

18:04.316 --> 18:05.750
(grunting)

18:07.386 --> 18:09.120
(cackling)

18:09.122 --> 18:10.855
Your courage is laughable.

18:10.857 --> 18:14.859
Come, let's see what
the odinforce
makes of you all!

18:15.828 --> 18:17.261
(grunting)

18:21.767 --> 18:24.302
They are brave
beyond my imagining.

18:24.503 --> 18:28.439
But they will need you
if they are to survive. Go.

18:28.807 --> 18:31.109
Sometimes I don't mind
you telling me what to do.

18:34.313 --> 18:36.214
(thor yelling)

18:38.650 --> 18:42.787
How does it feel to have
your father's own power
dead-set against you?

18:42.789 --> 18:46.457
I have no fear
of my father's power!

18:49.761 --> 18:52.563
Mangog: You are as foolishly
confident as he is.

18:52.731 --> 18:54.532
His worst quality.

18:55.335 --> 19:00.505
You will never break free
from the shadow
your father casts over you.

19:01.073 --> 19:03.574
Black widow:
He's not the only one
being cast over.

19:14.520 --> 19:15.653
No!

19:15.655 --> 19:16.888
All you, hawkeye.

19:16.890 --> 19:18.156
Got 'em.

19:22.661 --> 19:24.328
(roaring)

19:27.566 --> 19:28.900
No more toys!

19:29.268 --> 19:30.868
Let's just smash!

19:37.709 --> 19:38.809
(groaning)

19:43.615 --> 19:45.316
Rise, my son.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.955
The warriors need
their friend to end this.

19:51.323 --> 19:53.524
We could also use
our friend's father.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.859
You up to it?

19:58.230 --> 20:00.765
Is there fight
left in you, old man?

20:00.899 --> 20:02.733
Me? Perhaps.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.902
Them? Surely.

20:05.737 --> 20:08.306
You are on this earth,
mangog.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.741
Therefore, you are ours.

20:15.781 --> 20:17.415
You heard the hulk.

20:17.417 --> 20:18.916
No more toys!

20:20.852 --> 20:22.420
Rungnur...

20:27.926 --> 20:29.360
Is mine!

20:29.895 --> 20:30.962
(groaning)

20:31.930 --> 20:34.799
Tell me, how do my talents
strike you?

20:34.801 --> 20:37.301
Iron man: Look what I happened
to bring along.

20:37.469 --> 20:39.337
Just your size, too.

20:39.339 --> 20:41.505
I waited so long.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.641
An eternity!

20:43.643 --> 20:45.576
How could I fail?

20:45.578 --> 20:46.877
Heimdall!

20:46.879 --> 20:47.945
Portal.

20:48.614 --> 20:50.248
As long as it takes,

20:50.250 --> 20:52.483
I will wait for my revenge!

20:56.788 --> 21:00.458
Can you forgive an old man
his trespasses?

21:00.592 --> 21:02.026
Are we not family?

21:02.028 --> 21:03.828
That we are.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.997
You have proven yourselves
to me, avengers.

21:06.565 --> 21:09.367
Now, what else do I need
to know of this realm?

21:09.868 --> 21:13.004
I am ready
to learn why my son
loves this place so much.

21:13.006 --> 21:16.340
We have got to get you
out to the boardwalk

21:16.342 --> 21:17.975
For coney dogs
and a roller coaster.

21:20.046 --> 21:24.015
Hawkeye: (stutters)
don't even think about it,
odin's beard.

21:24.616 --> 21:26.050
We're taking the train.

21:26.052 --> 21:28.953
Your friends are very bold.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.888
And that is why
they are my friends.
