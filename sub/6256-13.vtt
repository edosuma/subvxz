00:50.163 --> 00:53.464
Screw you, man.

00:53.499 --> 00:56.000
No way you're gonna get me now.

00:56.035 --> 00:57.868
Clear!

01:09.816 --> 01:12.616
<i>You want to stop for breakfast</i>
<i>on the way to work, Booth?</i>

01:12.652 --> 01:14.072
Just give me a minute here,
Bones, okay? I'm kind of busy.

01:14.096 --> 01:15.153
What are you doing?

01:15.154 --> 01:16.887
Looking for that picture
that you gave me, all right?

01:16.923 --> 01:19.056
The one of you and Christine
when I was in prison.

01:19.092 --> 01:20.524
Well, careful, Booth!

01:20.560 --> 01:22.993
There could be broken glass in there.
Well, look,

01:23.029 --> 01:25.229
I was switching out my wallets
last night, okay?

01:25.264 --> 01:26.530
I took everything out.

01:26.566 --> 01:28.632
I had the picture right here.

01:28.668 --> 01:29.900
Now it's gone.

01:29.936 --> 01:31.702
Well, we can just
print out another one.

01:31.738 --> 01:33.804
That's not the point.

01:33.840 --> 01:35.840
Sorry. I just...

01:35.875 --> 01:37.975
The picture just
meant a lot to me.

01:38.010 --> 01:40.911
It got me through a lot of tough
times when I was in prison.

01:40.947 --> 01:42.513
Let me help.

01:44.584 --> 01:46.183
Booth.

01:46.219 --> 01:47.818
Yeah. Okay, got it.

01:47.854 --> 01:49.420
We're on our way. Yeah.

01:49.455 --> 01:51.622
Well...

01:51.657 --> 01:52.990
found it.

01:53.025 --> 01:54.759
Ah. Look at that.

01:54.794 --> 01:56.660
You got it.

01:56.696 --> 01:58.262
You're amazing.

01:58.297 --> 01:59.964
I must have looked in there
at least a thousand times.

01:59.999 --> 02:02.066
But <i> I</i> have
archaeological training,

02:02.101 --> 02:04.969
which involves going through the
rubbish of many civilizations.

02:05.004 --> 02:07.905
I once found a
Cro-Magnon bicuspid

02:07.940 --> 02:10.074
in petrified feces.

02:10.109 --> 02:12.109
Okay, that's really great.
Why don't we talk about that

02:12.145 --> 02:13.507
when we get into the car,
all the Cro-Magnon stuff.

02:13.531 --> 02:14.713
You would never guess

02:14.714 --> 02:16.614
that I was the only brave one...
Hey, guess what? Hey.

02:16.649 --> 02:18.215
Body in the lab.
Let's go. Body in the lab.

02:18.251 --> 02:20.484
Oh, I should go wash my hands.

02:24.690 --> 02:26.190
Hey, you're late.

02:26.225 --> 02:27.358
But I come bearing caffeine.

02:27.393 --> 02:28.726
I thought you were gonna

02:28.761 --> 02:30.261
come over last night.
I'm sorry, I was

02:30.296 --> 02:32.430
on the phone with my family,
and then it was so late

02:32.465 --> 02:34.832
that I just...
Is everything okay?

02:34.867 --> 02:36.867
Mr. Vaziri, we have remains

02:36.903 --> 02:38.769
that require
your attention.

02:38.805 --> 02:40.137
One second.
If it's not work-related,

02:40.173 --> 02:41.705
- Dr. Saroyan...
- Coming, Dr. Brennan.

02:41.741 --> 02:43.974
It's not a short
conversation, Cam.

02:44.010 --> 02:45.509
We'll talk later, okay?

02:52.118 --> 02:54.585
Well, remind me never
to get blown up.

02:54.620 --> 02:57.221
It was against OSHA regulations
to detonate after dark.

02:57.256 --> 02:59.223
Small comfort to
our friend here.

02:59.258 --> 03:01.325
Your use
of the singular is correct.

03:01.360 --> 03:03.727
There is no duplication
of parts so far,

03:03.763 --> 03:06.764
so I'd say we are dealing
with one set of remains.

03:06.799 --> 03:09.567
And according
to the greater sciatic notch,

03:09.602 --> 03:10.901
the victim was male.

03:10.937 --> 03:12.102
There's evidence of predation

03:12.138 --> 03:13.338
on the tissue.
Oh, please don't

03:13.372 --> 03:14.738
tell me that's
the skull.

03:14.774 --> 03:17.074
Judging from the presence
of teeth

03:17.109 --> 03:19.743
and what appears
to be brain fluid,

03:19.779 --> 03:20.878
I believe it is.

03:20.913 --> 03:23.280
Mr. Vaziri, please
reconstruct this.

03:23.316 --> 03:25.115
But it's, uh...

03:25.151 --> 03:27.184
it's...

03:27.220 --> 03:29.420
This is gonna take a long time.

03:29.455 --> 03:31.589
Then I suggest
you start immediately.

03:33.526 --> 03:36.927
I have epidermis
from his forearm

03:36.963 --> 03:39.096
that seems to be tattooed.

03:39.131 --> 03:40.664
That's tough to make out.

03:40.700 --> 03:42.066
Yeah, it's too dry.

03:42.101 --> 03:43.467
If I can rehydrate it,

03:43.503 --> 03:45.970
maybe Angela can
reconstruct the image.

03:46.005 --> 03:48.405
Given the state of the skull,
that may be our best chance

03:48.441 --> 03:50.174
at identifying the victim.

03:54.180 --> 03:56.647
Well, we have footprints--
two sets.

03:56.682 --> 03:58.582
Right, so he was
chased down the hill,

03:58.618 --> 03:59.884
and he hid in the mine.

03:59.919 --> 04:01.418
Which was packed
with explosives.

04:01.454 --> 04:03.020
Eh, bad for him.

04:03.055 --> 04:05.055
Well, there was
a "danger" sign.

04:05.091 --> 04:07.491
Guy's not gonna stop
to read the sign

04:07.527 --> 04:09.260
if he's being
chased by someone.

04:09.295 --> 04:11.028
Well, maybe next time he will.

04:11.063 --> 04:12.196
Next time?

04:12.231 --> 04:14.365
Reincarnation.
Reincarnation?

04:14.400 --> 04:16.399
That's what you're going
with? Reincarnation?

04:16.435 --> 04:17.468
No.

04:17.503 --> 04:19.103
Look at the footprints.

04:19.137 --> 04:20.271
One set stops here.

04:20.305 --> 04:21.772
At the fence.
Right. So what

04:21.807 --> 04:23.974
we got to find out is
where the chase started.

04:24.010 --> 04:26.443
Well, how are we gonna do that?
It's all blacktop,

04:26.479 --> 04:28.245
no footprints, nothing.
Eat your food.

04:28.281 --> 04:29.747
When you're done
eating your food,

04:29.782 --> 04:31.982
then we'll discuss
the case again, okay?

04:40.526 --> 04:42.826
I found antemortem
ligature marks

04:42.862 --> 04:44.762
on the scaphoid and
the triquetral.

04:44.797 --> 04:46.797
The victim
may have been restrained.

04:46.832 --> 04:48.432
Booth said
the victim was chased.

04:48.467 --> 04:49.833
He was probably
trying to escape.

04:49.869 --> 04:51.435
No, the striations on
the medial malleolus

04:51.470 --> 04:53.203
indicate his ankles
were also bound.

04:53.239 --> 04:54.672
Excellent work.

04:54.707 --> 04:57.207
It's just us now, Arastoo.

04:57.243 --> 04:59.343
What's going on
with your family?

05:01.247 --> 05:04.448
It's my brother, Hamid, in Iran.

05:04.483 --> 05:05.816
He's sick.

05:05.851 --> 05:08.185
What is it?

05:08.220 --> 05:09.587
Cancer.

05:09.622 --> 05:11.355
In his brain stem.

05:11.390 --> 05:13.257
It's too big
to excise.

05:13.292 --> 05:16.961
He doesn't have much time.

05:16.996 --> 05:18.596
I am so sorry.

05:18.631 --> 05:21.198
He's the only one
of us that stayed.

05:21.233 --> 05:22.533
After my parents fled,

05:22.568 --> 05:24.234
the government
wouldn't let him leave.

05:24.270 --> 05:27.538
And I've missed him
every day since.

05:27.573 --> 05:29.139
If there's anything I can do...

05:29.175 --> 05:30.674
I wish there was.

05:30.710 --> 05:33.110
But... this is all up to me now.

05:33.145 --> 05:36.146
I have to go back, make sure
he's getting the best care...

05:36.182 --> 05:37.314
Wait a second.

05:37.350 --> 05:38.782
You can't go back;
you were exiled.

05:38.818 --> 05:40.050
Not technically.

05:40.086 --> 05:41.552
I fled before
the edict was issued.

05:41.587 --> 05:42.820
So you're thinking

05:42.855 --> 05:45.356
of risking your life
on a technicality?

05:45.391 --> 05:46.523
No. You can't.

05:46.559 --> 05:48.359
You-you can call,
you can Skype.

05:48.394 --> 05:51.061
This is not your decision, Cam.

05:52.598 --> 05:53.998
Hey.

05:54.033 --> 05:55.899
Angela might have an I.D.

05:55.935 --> 05:58.936
I have to go.

05:58.971 --> 06:00.771
Promise me you won't do anything
until we have

06:00.806 --> 06:02.339
the chance
to talk this out, okay?

06:04.610 --> 06:06.543
You owe me that much.

06:06.579 --> 06:08.846
Okay.

06:12.818 --> 06:14.818
<i>This was definitely a tattoo.</i>

06:14.854 --> 06:16.854
Fortunately, the ink
from the tattoo is made

06:16.889 --> 06:19.490
from burned cotton,
aluminum, baby oil and urine.

06:19.525 --> 06:21.325
Urine? Why is
that fortunate?

06:21.360 --> 06:23.460
Well, it's a pretty standard
recipe used by convicts

06:23.496 --> 06:25.095
when they tattoo each other
in prison.

06:25.131 --> 06:27.097
Which allowed me
to narrow down the victims

06:27.133 --> 06:29.266
to current
and former convicts.

06:29.301 --> 06:31.602
Brilliant. So you
can run the image

06:31.637 --> 06:33.370
through the national prisoner
tattoo database.

06:33.406 --> 06:34.406
I already am.

06:34.440 --> 06:36.240
There's a database for that?

06:36.275 --> 06:37.441
At Michigan State.

06:37.476 --> 06:38.556
You name it, and somebody's

06:38.577 --> 06:40.277
built a database
for it.

06:42.615 --> 06:45.249
Okay, we have a match.

06:45.284 --> 06:47.251
Okay, Connor Freeman.

06:47.286 --> 06:49.453
Did five years
at Hazelton Penitentiary

06:49.488 --> 06:51.522
for attempted murder.

06:51.557 --> 06:53.390
Wait. Can
you enlarge

06:53.426 --> 06:55.726
the tattoo, focusing
on the edge of the tissue?

06:55.761 --> 06:58.028
This was a clean cut;
it wasn't torn

06:58.064 --> 06:59.396
by the explosion.

06:59.432 --> 07:01.165
Someone was trying
to cut out his tattoo?

07:01.200 --> 07:03.233
Bound, sliced
and blown to bits?

07:03.269 --> 07:06.570
What the hell
was this guy involved in?

Angela says that
the database shows

07:43.660 --> 07:46.661
that his tattoo is
from a prison gang.

07:46.697 --> 07:48.063
It's quite possible

07:48.098 --> 07:50.565
that a rival got out
and was looking for revenge.

07:50.601 --> 07:53.468
So you're saying this is his
fault because he was in prison?

07:53.503 --> 07:56.438
I'm not saying that,
Booth, but...

07:56.473 --> 07:59.140
his tattoo does indicate
that while incarcerated

07:59.176 --> 08:01.943
he was involved
with a violent element

08:01.979 --> 08:04.212
of the prison population.
Well, think about it.

08:04.248 --> 08:07.182
Probably had to do that in
order to, you know, survive.

08:07.217 --> 08:09.499
I was there for three months.

08:09.500 --> 08:11.065
All right? Look,
you got to do

08:11.101 --> 08:12.934
what you have to do
when you're in prison.

08:12.969 --> 08:14.269
All right? Don't be
so quick to judge.

08:14.304 --> 08:15.937
- Booth.
- I checked with

08:15.972 --> 08:17.505
the parole officer,
and I got Freeman's address.

08:17.541 --> 08:19.040
Do me a favor, get over there

08:19.075 --> 08:21.176
right away, look for any traces
you can find

08:21.211 --> 08:23.545
of an abduction or an assault.
On it.

08:23.580 --> 08:26.014
All right.

08:26.049 --> 08:27.549
Look...

08:27.584 --> 08:30.151
what I was saying before
about judging these guys...

08:30.187 --> 08:31.920
I'm not judging them.

08:31.955 --> 08:33.822
I don't do that, Booth.

08:33.857 --> 08:36.024
I just look for evidence.

08:36.058 --> 08:38.025
Okay.

08:38.061 --> 08:40.395
He'd only been here
for a few months.

08:40.429 --> 08:43.264
Didn't really know him.
Didn't want to.

08:43.299 --> 08:45.834
Don't want to know
anyone who lives here.

08:45.869 --> 08:49.504
I'll knock on your door
if I need anything else.

08:49.539 --> 08:51.472
Welcome to paradise.

08:57.747 --> 08:59.047
Hey. Hey!

08:59.082 --> 09:00.281
Who's there?

09:00.317 --> 09:01.449
Who the hell let you in?

09:01.484 --> 09:02.517
Uh, the super.

09:02.552 --> 09:04.018
Who are you?
No, no, no.

09:04.054 --> 09:06.054
You first.
Why are you here?

09:06.089 --> 09:08.089
I'm here because
Connor Freeman was murdered.

09:08.124 --> 09:10.158
Oh, my God.

09:10.193 --> 09:13.094
Who did it? Who did it?
Who-who killed him?

09:13.129 --> 09:15.530
Well, we don't know;
that's why I'm here.

09:15.565 --> 09:17.999
Your turn.
Yeah, sure. Um...

09:18.034 --> 09:19.367
I'm Sabrina Clevenger,

09:19.402 --> 09:22.203
and I was living
with Connor.

09:22.239 --> 09:23.872
And I wondered
why he'd been gone.

09:23.907 --> 09:25.607
You two having
any trouble lately?

09:25.642 --> 09:28.142
You know what?
Screw you. I loved him.

09:28.178 --> 09:30.712
You're gonna make it so I can't
even feel bad for him now?

09:30.747 --> 09:31.980
Why didn't you
report him missing?

09:32.015 --> 09:33.248
Right.

09:33.283 --> 09:35.016
So his parole officer
can find out.

09:35.051 --> 09:37.118
You know, one mistake and
they send you back to prison.

09:37.153 --> 09:39.087
Are you saying he was
making mistakes?

09:39.122 --> 09:41.356
No. He was clean.

09:41.391 --> 09:43.091
As far as you know.

09:43.126 --> 09:44.325
Yeah.

09:44.361 --> 09:47.228
And I know Connor--
he <i> was</i> clean.

09:47.264 --> 09:50.698
Ms. Clevenger...

09:50.734 --> 09:54.636
someone tried to remove
Connor's tattoo.

09:56.439 --> 10:00.208
Did he get into any trouble
at Hazelton that you know about?

10:01.578 --> 10:04.112
Connor didn't talk
about that with me.

10:05.982 --> 10:07.448
He was...

10:07.484 --> 10:09.450
all about planning
for the future.

10:09.486 --> 10:11.586
He spent, like,
every single day

10:11.621 --> 10:13.588
from 3:00 in
the morning

10:13.623 --> 10:16.858
to 5:00 in the afternoon
at work.

10:16.893 --> 10:19.294
He just wanted a good life.

10:19.329 --> 10:21.629
Where did he work?
Sunrise Bakery.

10:21.665 --> 10:24.465
He loved that job.

10:24.501 --> 10:26.668
It's what turned him around.

10:28.505 --> 10:31.339
Now, if it's okay with you,

10:31.374 --> 10:35.476
I'd really like to cry
and break some stuff right now.

10:38.682 --> 10:41.816
I found residue of polyethylene
on the triquetral injuries.

10:41.851 --> 10:44.719
So the victim was
bound with zip ties.

10:44.754 --> 10:46.154
Yeah, exactly.
So that got me thinking.

10:46.189 --> 10:49.757
Oh. No, no.
I'm not doing that again.

10:49.793 --> 10:51.953
What? No. No, no, no. That's not
what I was suggesting.

10:51.962 --> 10:54.262
Oh, but we can talk
about that later.

10:54.297 --> 10:57.699
Way later. What were you...
what were you thinking?

10:57.734 --> 10:59.767
Hmm? Right. Yeah, sorry.

10:59.803 --> 11:01.669
Uh, so I-I was compiling

11:01.705 --> 11:03.671
the particulates
that I'm finding on his clothes

11:03.707 --> 11:05.940
and on various pieces
of his remains.

11:05.976 --> 11:08.376
I was thinking that maybe
we could work backwards

11:08.411 --> 11:10.111
to figure out where the victim
was held captive.

11:10.146 --> 11:12.146
Well, there's a lot of
locations that overlap.

11:12.182 --> 11:15.216
I should be able to map the
potential paths he took.

11:15.251 --> 11:18.052
You know, I love that we have
the same interests.

11:18.088 --> 11:19.220
Keeps us close.

11:19.255 --> 11:21.122
I'm not doing it
again, Hodgins.

11:21.157 --> 11:24.058
But if you want me to
tie <i> you</i> to the bed, I...

11:24.094 --> 11:27.628
Okay. Okay, so far,
I've got some asbestos fibers.

11:27.664 --> 11:29.864
Ooh, look at this--
a leg of tobacco beetle,

11:29.899 --> 11:32.533
some petrified limestone dust,
oh, good old-fashioned rust...

11:32.569 --> 11:34.669
That's more like it.

11:34.704 --> 11:37.905
<i> Do you think</i>
<i>Freeman's girlfriend</i>

11:37.941 --> 11:39.540
is telling the truth?
Well, I hope so.

11:39.576 --> 11:41.743
I knew plenty of guys who just
wanted to make a clean start

11:41.778 --> 11:43.611
once they got out.
Recidivism statistics

11:43.646 --> 11:45.880
don't support that, Booth.
All right, well, look at your father.

11:45.915 --> 11:47.034
He turned his life around.

11:47.058 --> 11:48.550
Well, you said yourself
my father is unusual.

11:48.551 --> 11:51.085
But now I've been on
the inside, all right?

11:51.121 --> 11:52.854
There are some good men
in there, you know?

11:52.889 --> 11:55.556
A lot of them are just doing
their best not to go back.

11:55.592 --> 11:57.658
Just have a little faith.
Well, I'd like to.

11:57.694 --> 11:59.727
But you were innocent, Booth.

11:59.763 --> 12:03.598
Connor Freeman was in prison
for a reason.

12:03.633 --> 12:05.199
Right. All right.

12:05.235 --> 12:07.435
Where is the address to
this bakery we're going?

12:09.739 --> 12:11.406
Oh, it smells
so good in here.

12:11.441 --> 12:13.041
It's a good thing you brought me
rather than Aubrey.

12:13.076 --> 12:14.342
He'd eat everything in here.

12:14.377 --> 12:15.810
Not literally.
I was exaggerating for effect.

12:15.845 --> 12:17.612
Bones, I got it,
I got it, I got it.

12:17.647 --> 12:21.015
Look at those. How many ex-cons
end up making cream puffs?

12:21.051 --> 12:22.316
We're all ex-cons.

12:26.322 --> 12:27.642
And we got
fresh cherry pie today.

12:27.657 --> 12:29.023
That looks good, Booth.

12:29.059 --> 12:30.958
And we'll take one
of these. Box it up.

12:30.994 --> 12:32.391
Are you gonna take  the whole pie?
Sure, why not?

12:32.415 --> 12:33.635
Okay.

12:34.965 --> 12:37.465
<i> I've been running</i>
<i>Sunrise Bakery for six years.</i>

12:38.013 --> 12:40.613
I can't believe Connor's dead.
He was a good man.

12:40.649 --> 12:41.815
He was gonna make it.

12:41.850 --> 12:43.583
So everyone in here
has done time?

12:43.618 --> 12:46.186
Yeah.
Uh, my dad served time.

12:46.221 --> 12:48.488
You have no idea how hard it was
on our family.

12:48.523 --> 12:50.023
So I'm here to give these guys
the tools they need

12:50.058 --> 12:51.925
so that their families
don't have to go through

12:51.960 --> 12:53.726
- what mine did.
- I'd like to know

12:53.762 --> 12:56.229
your success rate, Mr. Flender.
A cash business like this

12:56.264 --> 12:57.730
must be tempting
for ex-convicts.

12:57.766 --> 12:59.766
Bones.
Maybe if these men

12:59.801 --> 13:01.734
didn't have someone like me
who believes in them,

13:01.770 --> 13:03.837
there'd be a problem.
Well, there is a problem.

13:03.872 --> 13:05.305
See, Connor Freeman is dead.

13:05.340 --> 13:07.106
True. I'm sorry.

13:07.142 --> 13:09.309
It's just, it's hard for me
to accept that, I guess.

13:09.344 --> 13:10.643
The victim
was cut. Do you mind

13:10.679 --> 13:12.545
if I check your
knives for blood?

13:12.581 --> 13:14.481
These men are gonna think
that you suspect them.

13:14.516 --> 13:16.416
Well, at this point,
I suspect everyone.

13:16.451 --> 13:17.329
Even you.

13:17.353 --> 13:18.586
All right, look, a lot
of these guys are gonna make it

13:18.587 --> 13:20.386
because of the work
that you've done, all right?

13:20.422 --> 13:22.088
And some of them won't.
You know, we can't let

13:22.123 --> 13:23.823
one bad apple ruin your work.

13:23.859 --> 13:26.092
Uh, just want
you to know,

13:26.127 --> 13:27.727
Connor wasn't causing
any trouble.

13:27.762 --> 13:29.229
He just kept his head down,

13:29.264 --> 13:30.997
did his work.
Hey.

13:31.032 --> 13:32.332
This is, uh, Alex Rockwell.

13:32.367 --> 13:33.600
Worked his way up
to assistant manager.

13:33.635 --> 13:34.868
Congratulations.

13:34.903 --> 13:36.135
You're a true anomaly.

13:36.171 --> 13:37.737
Huh?
Huh?

13:37.772 --> 13:39.138
What is she doing?

13:39.174 --> 13:40.473
The knives are all clean.

13:40.509 --> 13:43.009
Told you my guys
had nothing to do with this.

13:43.044 --> 13:44.911
What about outside of work?
He had a tattoo

13:44.946 --> 13:46.913
someone was trying to cut out,
so someone was angry with him.

13:46.948 --> 13:49.582
He could've done it himself.
He hated that tat.

13:49.618 --> 13:51.751
He said it reminded him
of all the trouble he caused.

13:51.786 --> 13:53.286
He's not cutting
it out himself, Saltz.

13:53.321 --> 13:55.622
Have you talked
to Pemberton?

13:55.657 --> 13:58.191
Pemberton? Who's Pemberton?
Connor was a driver

13:58.226 --> 14:00.393
in a convenience store robbery
that went bad.

14:00.428 --> 14:02.428
A clerk got shot.
She was Pemberton's sister.

14:02.464 --> 14:04.030
When Pemberton found
Connor got out

14:04.065 --> 14:06.933
on parole, he'd come by.
He made threats, you know?

14:06.968 --> 14:09.369
You didn't think this was
important enough to tell us?

14:09.404 --> 14:11.638
These men are confronted
by their past all the time.

14:11.673 --> 14:12.906
Nothing ever comes of it.

14:12.941 --> 14:14.607
Well, it has now, hasn't it?

14:20.148 --> 14:22.081
You're avoiding me.

14:22.117 --> 14:24.250
I'm not. I have to work.

14:24.286 --> 14:25.286
Dr. Brennan wants...

14:25.320 --> 14:27.253
Don't lie to me,
Arastoo.

14:27.289 --> 14:29.155
If you're really thinking
of going to Iran,

14:29.190 --> 14:30.557
that affects me, too.

14:30.592 --> 14:32.158
You can't make it
a unilateral decision.

14:32.193 --> 14:34.260
But it is.

14:34.296 --> 14:37.697
It's my decision
alone, Cam.

14:37.732 --> 14:39.432
It's my family.
It's my risk.

14:39.467 --> 14:42.101
I'm your family, too.
You always want to talk

14:42.137 --> 14:44.537
about marriage, fine.
What does marriage mean to you?

14:44.573 --> 14:46.272
What do I mean to you?
That's not fair.

14:46.308 --> 14:48.708
No, what you're doing
isn't fair.

14:48.743 --> 14:51.144
How would it help your brother
if you wind up in prison,

14:51.179 --> 14:52.712
or worse?

14:52.747 --> 14:54.414
The regime isn't
the same as it was.

14:54.449 --> 14:56.583
I have a better chance now
of avoiding an investigation.

14:56.618 --> 14:58.084
The minute you set foot
into that country,

14:58.119 --> 14:59.519
you are an Iranian.

14:59.554 --> 15:01.921
You are no longer
an American citizen.

15:01.957 --> 15:03.856
Cam, I love you.

15:03.892 --> 15:06.659
But I have to make sure
he gets the best care.

15:06.695 --> 15:10.129
My parents can't go back.
I'm the only one who can help.

15:10.165 --> 15:12.765
So...

15:12.801 --> 15:14.767
there's no discussion here?

15:14.803 --> 15:16.936
None at all?

15:19.608 --> 15:21.441
We have a murder
to solve, Cam.

15:21.476 --> 15:24.310
Can we just do that
for now, please?

15:28.183 --> 15:30.917
Of course, Mr. Vaziri.

15:32.654 --> 15:34.454
What have you found?

15:34.489 --> 15:37.624
Kerf marks to
the clavicles

15:37.659 --> 15:40.426
and the upper thorax--
all symmetrical.

15:40.462 --> 15:41.961
I measured them
with a protractor.

15:41.997 --> 15:44.497
They make
a perfect isosceles triangle.

15:44.532 --> 15:46.699
And the significance?
Not sure.

15:46.735 --> 15:50.203
But there are additional kerf
marks on the right scapula

15:50.238 --> 15:53.373
that suggest
a downward stabbing motion.

15:53.408 --> 15:56.142
Suggesting that the killer may
have made the initial incision

15:56.177 --> 15:57.543
while the victim was restrained.

15:57.579 --> 16:01.314
And then stabbing him
in the back as he ran.

16:02.784 --> 16:04.384
Well, that's very helpful.

16:04.419 --> 16:06.152
Thank you.

16:07.022 --> 16:08.354
Cam.

16:08.390 --> 16:11.357
Yes.

16:11.393 --> 16:13.526
I love you.

16:13.561 --> 16:16.963
I'm sorry, but...

16:16.998 --> 16:19.966
I don't really know
what that means right now.

16:29.978 --> 16:31.978
<i>They let that lowlife Freeman</i>

16:32.013 --> 16:34.614
out of prison, and I'm the guy
hauled into the FBI?

16:34.649 --> 16:37.650
Yeah, Mr. Pemberton, because you
were threatening that lowlife

16:37.686 --> 16:39.218
and now he's dead.

16:39.254 --> 16:41.788
Dead? Really?

16:41.823 --> 16:44.590
Yeah, really. Did you want to do
a little dance there, Jason?

16:44.626 --> 16:46.492
You want me to be sad?

16:46.528 --> 16:49.295
He shot my sister.
He didn't.

16:49.330 --> 16:51.831
And even the shooter testified
that Freeman had no idea

16:51.866 --> 16:54.500
a robbery was going
to take place.

16:54.536 --> 16:56.803
They left her bleeding
on the floor.

16:56.838 --> 16:58.137
She can't walk now,
did you know that?

16:58.173 --> 17:00.206
Yeah. And I'm
sorry for that.

17:00.241 --> 17:02.108
What they did was reprehensible,

17:02.143 --> 17:05.310
but so is vigilante justice,
all right?

17:05.346 --> 17:08.347
So why don't you help me
out here. Where were you

17:08.383 --> 17:11.884
last Monday between the hours
of 1:00 and 6:00?

17:11.920 --> 17:14.020
I don't know. Maybe work.

17:14.055 --> 17:15.354
Maybe following
Freeman?

17:15.390 --> 17:17.290
Couple of guys he works with

17:17.325 --> 17:19.892
say they saw you
outside the bakery.

17:21.762 --> 17:23.695
Okay. Yeah.

17:23.732 --> 17:26.165
Sure, I was following him.
See?

17:26.201 --> 17:29.235
This is good. Prosecutor will
understand if you come clean.

17:29.270 --> 17:30.770
I didn't
kill him though.

17:30.805 --> 17:32.271
I was waiting for him
to mess up,

17:32.307 --> 17:33.806
so I could get him
locked up again.

17:33.842 --> 17:36.743
I followed him with a camera
every chance I got.

17:36.778 --> 17:39.212
Maybe since he was keeping
his nose so clean,

17:39.247 --> 17:41.414
you got a little
frustrated, impatient.

17:41.449 --> 17:43.149
I have rights, too,
you know.

17:43.184 --> 17:44.951
It's not just the criminals
that have rights.

17:44.986 --> 17:48.087
And I don't think
I want to talk to you anymore.

17:54.362 --> 17:56.295
Oh, perfect timing.

17:56.331 --> 17:58.664
Hodgins found zinc particulates
that I matched

17:58.700 --> 18:00.266
to this section of fence

18:00.301 --> 18:02.969
and some tobacco beetle bits
that I traced back

18:03.004 --> 18:05.138
to a flour warehouse.

18:05.173 --> 18:09.108
Despite the name, the beetles
like wheat more than tobacco.

18:09.144 --> 18:11.677
Wow. You sound
like your husband.

18:14.649 --> 18:17.450
Are you and Arastoo
still fighting?

18:17.485 --> 18:19.752
I don't want to
talk about it.

18:19.788 --> 18:22.755
Okay. Well, since you two
were spotted

18:22.791 --> 18:25.324
looking really intense
earlier,

18:25.360 --> 18:27.827
everyone else
is already talking about it.

18:30.799 --> 18:33.566
Arastoo's thinking
of going back to Iran.

18:33.601 --> 18:34.801
What?

18:34.836 --> 18:36.636
Isn't that dangerous
for him?

18:36.671 --> 18:39.105
Yeah, very. But
his brother's sick,

18:39.140 --> 18:41.841
and apparently I have
no say in the matter.

18:41.876 --> 18:44.310
I had no idea. I...

18:44.345 --> 18:48.114
I respect it's his brother.
I-I read his medical report.

18:48.149 --> 18:49.682
It doesn't look good.

18:49.717 --> 18:51.584
Oh, God, Cam.

18:51.619 --> 18:53.152
I'm so sorry.

18:53.188 --> 18:56.789
Well, let's just...
solve the case.

18:56.825 --> 18:58.724
I, uh...

18:58.760 --> 19:02.161
I was looking at the
victim's heart tissue

19:02.197 --> 19:05.231
and found
severely depleted ATP levels.

19:05.266 --> 19:07.366
Uh, ATP. You're gonna have
to help me out with that one.

19:07.402 --> 19:08.968
It means he was
so exhausted

19:09.003 --> 19:10.803
that his muscles were
about to give out.

19:10.839 --> 19:13.472
Huh. Well, can you tell
how far he ran?

19:13.508 --> 19:15.274
That would narrow down
where he escaped from.

19:15.310 --> 19:17.877
Well, I can give you
time, not distance.

19:17.912 --> 19:19.912
He ran for about
30 minutes,

19:19.948 --> 19:21.681
adrenaline
pumping on full.

19:21.716 --> 19:24.350
Well, that'll add
a few square miles and...

19:24.385 --> 19:26.319
several thousand buildings
to the search.

19:26.354 --> 19:28.087
So that makes it
more difficult.

19:28.122 --> 19:31.090
I also analyzed the tissue
using liquid chromatography,

19:31.125 --> 19:33.092
and it didn't help
with the ATP levels,

19:33.127 --> 19:35.394
but it did turn up
traces of etorphine.

19:35.430 --> 19:38.030
Isn't that an opioid?
Yeah, a very strong one.

19:38.066 --> 19:39.932
It should have knocked
him out completely.

19:39.968 --> 19:43.569
And yet he could break free
from his restraints and run

19:43.605 --> 19:45.671
30 minutes at top speed?

19:45.707 --> 19:48.007
What are we missing?

19:51.073 --> 19:53.944
Drugs?
Yep. Arastoo sectioned the femur.

19:54.078 --> 19:56.378
The marrow tested positive
for multiple opiates:

19:56.413 --> 19:58.913
OxyContin, Percocet,
fentanyl,

19:58.949 --> 20:01.249
and a few minor bathtub
variety players.

20:01.284 --> 20:03.451
There you go. So much
for cleaning up his act.

20:03.487 --> 20:05.587
Yeah. Well, it explains why he wasn't
knocked out by the etorphine.

20:05.622 --> 20:07.155
He'd built up
a resistance.

20:07.190 --> 20:09.357
And nobody at the bakery
mentioned his drug use?

20:09.392 --> 20:11.726
Well, you know, a lot of people,
you know, they're good at hiding it.

20:11.761 --> 20:14.162
The girlfriend though, that's...
that's a whole nother story.

20:14.197 --> 20:16.431
He... You know what, she had
to have known. I bet she knew.

20:16.466 --> 20:18.666
So she was protecting him.
Tell you what,

20:18.702 --> 20:21.336
I'll get Aubrey
to, uh, talk to her again.

20:21.371 --> 20:24.339
So, uh, what's going on
with Arastoo?

20:24.374 --> 20:26.107
Is he really thinking
about heading back?

20:26.143 --> 20:29.344
Yeah. Actually, that's why
I wanted to talk to you.

20:29.379 --> 20:32.847
You've been over there.
He says he's gonna be okay.

20:32.883 --> 20:34.716
And you want me to say
that everything's gonna be fine.

20:34.751 --> 20:37.485
No. I want you to
tell me the truth.

20:37.521 --> 20:39.587
The truth. Well, it's
possible he'll be fine,

20:39.623 --> 20:41.322
but, you know,
he turned his back on the regime

20:41.358 --> 20:43.478
when he became an American
citizen-- that's dangerous.

20:43.493 --> 20:45.360
Well, that's what
I'm afraid of.

20:45.395 --> 20:47.362
But...

20:47.397 --> 20:49.330
he won't listen to anybody,
and he feels guilty

20:49.366 --> 20:51.366
that he left his
brother behind.

20:51.401 --> 20:54.402
Right. How about Alex at State?
Did you talk to him?

20:54.437 --> 20:56.771
Yeah, he advised
against it,

20:56.806 --> 20:59.340
so I've called a friend at
Doctors Without Borders,

20:59.376 --> 21:00.842
and, hopefully,
if Arastoo knows

21:00.877 --> 21:02.777
his brother's getting
the best care...

21:02.812 --> 21:06.014
It's family, Cam. It's hard
to turn your back on family.

21:06.049 --> 21:07.815
Yeah, I'm just... I'm...

21:07.851 --> 21:09.751
I am so scared, Seeley.

21:09.786 --> 21:11.486
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

21:11.521 --> 21:14.055
You know, look, if Arastoo
can work with Bones,

21:14.090 --> 21:16.124
dealing with the Iranians--

21:16.159 --> 21:19.194
it's gonna be a piece
of cake, right? Right?

21:19.229 --> 21:22.697
Connor was doing drugs,
wasn't he, Sabrina?

21:22.732 --> 21:24.332
Not that I knew of.

21:24.367 --> 21:25.833
Really?

21:25.869 --> 21:27.635
System was
full of opioids.

21:27.671 --> 21:29.938
Usually a loved one
notices something like that.

21:29.973 --> 21:31.372
I don't know. I just...

21:31.408 --> 21:33.341
thought maybe he had
a few beers is all.

21:33.376 --> 21:34.742
Kind of seems to me like

21:34.778 --> 21:37.345
you don't want
to know who killed Connor.

21:37.380 --> 21:39.080
What the hell are
you talking about?

21:39.115 --> 21:40.515
Well, you're not helping.

21:40.550 --> 21:43.184
Maybe you have something
to hide.

21:43.220 --> 21:47.322
Look, I tried everything
to get him to stop.

21:47.357 --> 21:49.924
Okay, he was running
through every dime we had.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.359
So he was taking your money?

21:51.394 --> 21:52.694
He-he had a problem.

21:52.729 --> 21:54.529
It was hard for
him being out

21:54.564 --> 21:56.698
and adjusting, you know,
so I just wanted to help him.

21:56.733 --> 21:58.933
You know where
he was getting his stuff?

21:58.969 --> 22:00.401
Maybe his dealer killed him.

22:00.437 --> 22:01.836
I don't know.

22:01.871 --> 22:03.438
I swear. I told Connor

22:03.473 --> 22:05.873
I didn't want to have
anything to do with drugs.

22:05.909 --> 22:07.508
So you cut him off?

22:09.613 --> 22:12.046
He had a good heart.

22:12.082 --> 22:14.349
Connor did.

22:14.384 --> 22:17.885
And whatever he
was involved in,

22:17.921 --> 22:21.623
he didn't deserve to die.

22:25.395 --> 22:29.330
I've only partially
reconstructed the skull,

22:29.366 --> 22:31.966
but I found a puncture mark

22:32.002 --> 22:33.401
at the base of the occipital.

22:33.436 --> 22:35.403
It appears
to be an injection site.

22:35.438 --> 22:36.771
Yes, and judging
from the angle,

22:36.806 --> 22:38.273
he couldn't have
done it to himself.

22:38.308 --> 22:40.408
Perhaps he was sedated
to make his abduction easier.

22:40.443 --> 22:42.310
But because he'd
built up a tolerance,

22:42.345 --> 22:44.379
the injection wasn't strong
enough, which is why he escaped.

22:44.414 --> 22:46.114
I can't believe
he got into drugs

22:46.149 --> 22:47.549
so soon after
getting out of prison.

22:47.550 --> 22:48.983
You would think
he'd do everything

22:49.019 --> 22:50.418
he could not to go back.

22:50.453 --> 22:51.786
It's an odd position
for you to take

22:51.821 --> 22:53.354
at this time,
don't you think?

22:53.390 --> 22:55.456
Excuse me?
If avoiding prison

22:55.492 --> 22:57.392
was the goal, then you wouldn't
travel back to Iran.

22:57.427 --> 22:59.327
There's no warrant
out for my arrest.

22:59.362 --> 23:00.662
Because you're not there.
I was 18.

23:00.697 --> 23:01.763
I'm hardly someone

23:01.798 --> 23:03.197
they're interested in.

23:03.233 --> 23:05.199
And yet you've avoided
going back to see

23:05.235 --> 23:06.367
your brother for years.

23:06.403 --> 23:07.935
If you're serious

23:07.971 --> 23:10.938
about going, you need
to be honest about the risks,

23:10.974 --> 23:14.776
and honest with Dr. Saroyan,
so if you never see her again,

23:14.811 --> 23:17.178
at least you know
you didn't lie to her.

23:19.049 --> 23:21.249
Please finish
reconstructing the skull,

23:21.284 --> 23:23.184
and see if there are
any other injuries

23:23.219 --> 23:26.120
that could give us a weapon
that was used in the assault.

23:34.664 --> 23:37.131
<i> Mr. Saltz, you were</i>
<i>locked up for dealing drugs.</i>

23:37.167 --> 23:38.833
<i>Yeah, but I served my time.</i>

23:38.868 --> 23:41.536
I'm clean.
I'm pee-in-a-cup clean.

23:41.571 --> 23:43.671
But you knew
Connor wasn't.

23:43.707 --> 23:45.039
I mind my own business.

23:45.075 --> 23:46.974
I ain't trying
to do no more time.

23:47.010 --> 23:48.676
Who'd he get
his stuff from?

23:48.712 --> 23:51.045
I don't know.
He asked me for my help,

23:51.081 --> 23:52.413
and I said no.

23:52.449 --> 23:55.016
Roger would fire me
if I did anything wrong.

23:55.051 --> 23:57.585
Anybody else at the bakery know
what Connor was into?

23:57.620 --> 23:59.020
We all suspected,

23:59.055 --> 24:00.321
except Roger.

24:00.357 --> 24:01.589
That dude invented

24:01.624 --> 24:03.224
rose-colored glasses.

24:03.259 --> 24:06.794
And, uh, what else did you
suspect Connor was into?

24:06.830 --> 24:09.597
I answer, you could
charge me with accessory.

24:09.632 --> 24:11.099
Yeah, and if you don't,

24:11.134 --> 24:14.335
I charge you with
impeding an investigation.

24:19.609 --> 24:21.509
I told him not to do it.

24:21.544 --> 24:24.045
I told him
I didn't want no part of it.

24:24.080 --> 24:25.413
None of us did.

24:25.448 --> 24:26.514
I swear.

24:26.549 --> 24:28.282
I'm waiting.

24:28.318 --> 24:32.553
He said he was gonna
knock off a store or something.

24:32.589 --> 24:34.222
He knew somebody
on the inside.

24:34.257 --> 24:36.023
Which store?
I don't know.

24:36.059 --> 24:37.592
I didn't want to know.

24:37.627 --> 24:39.794
I just wanted to bake bread

24:39.829 --> 24:43.197
and make enough money
to marry my girl.

24:49.506 --> 24:51.839
Hey. I'm trying to track
where the victim came from.

24:51.875 --> 24:53.975
Oh, this is a lot easier. Don't
you want to take a little break?

24:54.010 --> 24:55.376
Well, no, not
since I found

24:55.412 --> 24:57.412
ascomycota fungi
on the victim's shirt.

24:57.447 --> 24:58.880
Well, this won't
take long.

24:58.915 --> 25:02.216
So these are all the charges
on his debit card?

25:02.252 --> 25:04.352
Yeah. for the two weeks
before he died.

25:04.387 --> 25:05.887
Well, most of them
are for parking meters,

25:05.922 --> 25:07.555
and they're coded
for the same neighborhood.

25:07.590 --> 25:08.856
Preceded by charges for food.

25:08.892 --> 25:10.258
Oh.

25:10.293 --> 25:11.893
Look who's into it now.
Please.

25:11.928 --> 25:13.561
I'm instinctively
curious.

25:13.596 --> 25:15.096
So where are these meters?

25:15.131 --> 25:16.531
Uh...

25:16.566 --> 25:19.267
they're in Anacostia.

25:19.302 --> 25:21.202
And he fed them regularly.

25:21.237 --> 25:22.937
Can you show me that block?

25:22.972 --> 25:26.007
And each meter is coded?

25:26.042 --> 25:28.609
- Yeah, they have to be.
- My money's on

25:28.645 --> 25:30.545
the two meters across from
the check-cashing place.

25:30.580 --> 25:32.046
Hodgins is right.

25:32.081 --> 25:33.781
He used those
two meters

25:33.817 --> 25:36.050
and stayed an average of
two and a half hours each time.

25:36.085 --> 25:37.585
Yeah, because he was

25:37.620 --> 25:38.653
casing the place.

25:38.688 --> 25:40.188
Hey, he was planning to rob it.

25:40.223 --> 25:42.089
You kind of stole my thunder
there, Hodgins.

25:42.125 --> 25:44.258
King of the lab, Aubrey.

25:44.294 --> 25:46.661
So Booth said that he had
someone on the inside.

25:46.696 --> 25:48.496
Okay, well,
sometimes

25:48.531 --> 25:51.499
the Web sites have a list
of company employees.

25:54.604 --> 25:55.870
Look at that.

25:55.905 --> 25:58.039
Assistant Manager
Sabrina Clevenger.

25:58.074 --> 25:59.674
That's Freeman's girlfriend.

25:59.709 --> 26:03.611
Looks like you have
your inside man.

26:07.053 --> 26:08.939
<i>We know that you were gonna rob</i>

26:08.940 --> 26:11.206
the check-cashing place
with Connor.

26:11.241 --> 26:12.574
No.

26:13.514 --> 26:15.147
I've got no record.
Check it out.

26:15.182 --> 26:16.986
I never helped with a robbery.
Then maybe

26:16.987 --> 26:19.268
you killed him so you wouldn't
have to go through with it.

26:19.288 --> 26:20.688
Why are you
doing this to me?

26:20.723 --> 26:22.123
I told you,
I loved Connor.

26:22.158 --> 26:23.758
That's why I
told him no.

26:23.793 --> 26:26.961
So you admit that he wanted
to rob the place.

26:26.996 --> 26:30.564
He wanted me to leave the
back door open, but I said no.

26:30.600 --> 26:32.466
We had a fight,
and he walked out.

26:32.502 --> 26:33.901
That's why
I didn't think anything

26:33.936 --> 26:35.803
of not seeing him
for a few days.

26:35.838 --> 26:38.372
And you couldn't have told me
all of this before?

26:38.408 --> 26:39.540
He was dead.

26:39.575 --> 26:41.142
What difference did it make?

26:41.177 --> 26:43.344
And if the other guy
found out that I was a snitch,

26:43.379 --> 26:45.246
then what?
Wait, wait, wait. What other guy?

26:45.281 --> 26:47.515
Connor was working with someone else?
I don't know who.

26:47.550 --> 26:49.383
One of the cons from work.

26:49.419 --> 26:52.920
He must've roped Connor into it
because Connor was a good guy.

26:52.955 --> 26:55.289
Maybe not as good
as you thought.

26:57.093 --> 26:58.859
Arastoo,

26:58.895 --> 27:00.361
I need two minutes.
Sure.

27:00.396 --> 27:02.563
But first, look at this.

27:02.598 --> 27:05.299
Striations on
the mental eminence.

27:05.334 --> 27:07.401
Perimortem. The directionality
of the striations

27:07.437 --> 27:10.037
suggests that the victim fell
as he was being chased.

27:10.073 --> 27:12.073
Nothing odd in that. I'd be
surprised if he didn't fall.

27:12.108 --> 27:14.475
Right. But when
I stained the mandible

27:14.510 --> 27:17.144
as well as the victim's
patellas and metacarpals

27:17.180 --> 27:20.081
with hematoxylin and did
a microscopic analysis...

27:20.116 --> 27:21.615
Corresponding striations.

27:21.651 --> 27:24.218
That contained
particulates.

27:24.253 --> 27:26.087
Dr. Hodgins is
analyzing them now.

27:26.122 --> 27:27.755
Depending on
where he fell,

27:27.790 --> 27:29.590
the particulates
might help pinpoint

27:29.625 --> 27:31.358
where he was being held.

27:31.394 --> 27:32.760
Very good.

27:32.795 --> 27:34.028
Now my two minutes?

27:34.063 --> 27:36.464
Can't this wait? Please?

27:36.499 --> 27:38.365
Not when you're pricing out
tickets to Iran.

27:38.401 --> 27:40.735
You forgot to
close your browser

27:40.770 --> 27:43.504
on the platform
computer you used.

27:46.442 --> 27:49.777
I talked to a cousin over there.

27:49.812 --> 27:52.613
He said my brother is failing.

27:52.648 --> 27:55.716
I don't know
how much time he has left.

27:55.752 --> 27:57.418
I contacted a friend at
Doctors Without Borders.

27:57.453 --> 27:59.186
He knows a great doctor
in Tehran.

27:59.222 --> 28:00.755
He said he'd promise

28:00.790 --> 28:02.890
to make sure...
Yeah, but he can't make sure

28:02.925 --> 28:05.926
that I'm holding Hamid's hand
if he's dying, Cam.

28:09.632 --> 28:13.601
Have you thought about me even
once in all of this, Arastoo?

28:13.636 --> 28:16.570
I tried not to.

28:16.606 --> 28:20.908
The thought of choosing between
the people I love...

28:20.943 --> 28:22.510
it's impossible.

28:22.545 --> 28:25.913
I even thought,
hey, Hamid's dying.

28:25.948 --> 28:28.949
When I get there, he might not
even know it's me.

28:28.985 --> 28:32.052
But I'm not doing this
for me, Cam.

28:32.088 --> 28:35.856
I'm doing it so a member
of my family won't suffer alone.

28:35.892 --> 28:36.892
But Iran...

28:36.893 --> 28:39.126
Iran is
a wonderful country.

28:39.162 --> 28:40.795
Thousands of years old.

28:40.830 --> 28:43.430
It... it's a part of me.

28:43.466 --> 28:46.567
And politics aside,
I miss it every day.

28:48.070 --> 28:51.071
I have to believe that
there's a basic goodness there,

28:51.107 --> 28:53.641
a decency that will
keep me safe.

28:56.512 --> 29:00.014
I promise, you will
not lose me, Cam.

29:02.585 --> 29:06.020
I wish you could
know that.

29:06.055 --> 29:09.056
You understand?

29:09.091 --> 29:10.758
Even a little?

29:10.793 --> 29:13.694
I understand
that I hate this.

29:15.464 --> 29:19.600
But that I love
you even more.

29:26.309 --> 29:28.642
The particulates
were traces of... Oh.

29:28.678 --> 29:31.111
Ah, you have
information

29:31.147 --> 29:33.581
pertaining to the
case, Dr. Hodgins?

29:33.616 --> 29:35.583
Yeah.
The particulates

29:35.618 --> 29:37.852
were traces of glass made with

29:37.887 --> 29:39.119
manganese.

29:39.155 --> 29:41.188
Manganese?
Over a hundred years old.

29:41.224 --> 29:46.627
So, Angie's just
factoring that into her map now.

29:46.662 --> 29:48.229
Thank you.

29:51.834 --> 29:53.200
Manganese.

29:53.236 --> 29:55.336
Mm-hmm. That's good.

29:58.474 --> 30:00.908
I worked with Connor for almost
a year, so you'll understand

30:00.943 --> 30:03.510
if I find it a little hard
to believe that he planned

30:03.546 --> 30:05.713
a major crime.
Perhaps your idealistic views

30:05.748 --> 30:07.948
of rehabilitation were
unrealistic, Mr. Flender.

30:07.984 --> 30:10.150
Well, it's always better
to hope, isn't it?

30:10.186 --> 30:12.186
- I agree.
- But maybe if you weren't blinded

30:12.221 --> 30:14.255
by hope, you'd have seen
the victim for who he was.

30:14.290 --> 30:16.156
Yes, a victim.

30:16.192 --> 30:19.827
Of circumstance, class, lack of
opportunity, simple rotten luck.

30:19.862 --> 30:22.663
I'm sorry, Dr. Brennan,
but I refuse to believe

30:22.698 --> 30:26.066
that we can't make sure that
there is goodness in this world.

30:26.102 --> 30:27.735
Let's just focus on trying

30:27.770 --> 30:29.737
to, you know, find the killer,
that's all.

30:29.772 --> 30:31.872
So, which of your men
was closest to Freeman?

30:31.908 --> 30:34.308
I give you someone
else, they'll feel

30:34.343 --> 30:35.976
that they're gonna
be scapegoats.

30:36.012 --> 30:37.478
Look, I don't want to

30:37.513 --> 30:39.446
arrest you for impeding
an investigation,

30:39.482 --> 30:41.015
but I will.

30:41.050 --> 30:43.417
If you have to,
you have to.

30:43.452 --> 30:45.519
If you really cared
about these men,

30:45.554 --> 30:47.454
why would you choose
to be imprisoned

30:47.490 --> 30:50.291
rather than help us find
Connor Freeman's killer?

30:50.326 --> 30:52.192
Because I believe
in all of my men.

30:52.228 --> 30:53.694
And since you have no proof,

30:53.729 --> 30:55.462
I think you're looking
in the wrong place.

30:55.498 --> 30:57.865
And if locking me up
is what it takes

30:57.900 --> 31:01.635
to show that
I'm on their side, so be it.

31:06.976 --> 31:10.644
The blue area is all the
particulates that Hodgins found.

31:10.680 --> 31:12.313
Green is the bone stuff,

31:12.348 --> 31:15.282
and red is the range of travel,
which came from

31:15.318 --> 31:17.217
Cam's ATP test.
What's that brown line?

31:17.253 --> 31:21.255
Well, the brown line is where
everything should overlap.

31:21.290 --> 31:22.790
Which is the route
that Freeman took.

31:22.825 --> 31:25.159
Hopefully.
Most of the evidence we have

31:25.194 --> 31:26.694
is close to the mine,

31:26.729 --> 31:28.128
so I'm running
the simulation backwards.

31:28.164 --> 31:30.197
So, first, we start

31:30.232 --> 31:32.800
with the body
as it was discovered.

31:32.835 --> 31:34.301
In pieces, near the mine.

31:34.337 --> 31:35.803
I used a crime scene photo
for reference,

31:35.838 --> 31:37.705
and then it was just a matter of

31:37.740 --> 31:40.441
plugging in Hodgins' horrible
little math problem

31:40.476 --> 31:42.443
to figure out point of impact.

31:42.478 --> 31:44.578
Cool.
Next I take Freeman

31:44.613 --> 31:46.847
up to this fence.

31:49.719 --> 31:52.553
Can you determine where
the victim sustained injuries

31:52.588 --> 31:53.988
to the mental eminence
and the patellas?

31:54.023 --> 31:54.955
Well, that's where

31:54.991 --> 31:56.023
it gets tougher.

31:56.058 --> 31:58.158
Soot and soil, tobacco beetles

31:58.194 --> 32:01.128
and paving materials
only take us another 500 yards,

32:01.163 --> 32:02.763
and then there's a range
of possibilities

32:02.765 --> 32:05.699
of where he could have been
held captive.

32:05.735 --> 32:07.935
I swabbed the patellas and got
the glass with manganese in it,

32:07.970 --> 32:10.337
so it had to be in a building
that went up prior to 1910.

32:10.373 --> 32:12.906
Okay.

32:12.942 --> 32:16.543
Okay, there's 15 that are still
left standing in the area,

32:16.579 --> 32:18.545
so I'll eliminate
the ones that are

32:18.581 --> 32:21.281
off vector or are too far away.

32:21.317 --> 32:25.319
Uh, which means our
most likely suspect is...

32:25.354 --> 32:27.521
Scovell Iron Works.

32:27.556 --> 32:28.789
It's right on
the edge of

32:28.824 --> 32:30.657
our range,
so there's a good chance

32:30.693 --> 32:32.159
that's where
the killer held Freeman

32:32.194 --> 32:33.994
before he got away.

32:46.008 --> 32:48.409
Keep your eyes open; never know
what we're walking into.

32:48.444 --> 32:50.310
I always assume bullets.

33:02.792 --> 33:04.992
Well, it's a perfect
place to hide.

33:05.027 --> 33:06.827
Nobody wants
to come in here.

33:06.862 --> 33:08.996
Yeah, that's for sure.

33:12.068 --> 33:13.500
Ah.

33:13.536 --> 33:15.869
Tac loop.

33:15.905 --> 33:19.706
Broken. Must've been from
the restraints he popped off.

33:19.742 --> 33:21.642
He was definitely here.

33:21.677 --> 33:24.078
Squints said that
the killer made symmetrical cuts

33:24.113 --> 33:25.412
on the victim.

33:25.448 --> 33:27.081
That would take time.

33:27.116 --> 33:28.348
So we're looking for

33:28.384 --> 33:30.918
a work space, somewhere dry.

33:32.888 --> 33:35.789
With light.
That certainly fits the bill.

33:40.996 --> 33:42.396
Huh. A little jumpy?

33:42.431 --> 33:43.697
Little bit.

33:43.732 --> 33:46.934
Have I mentioned
how much I hate this place?

33:46.969 --> 33:49.103
Wow.

33:51.941 --> 33:53.907
Whole lot of blood.

33:53.943 --> 33:56.777
Maybe a few days old.

33:59.081 --> 34:01.982
Booth. Over here
in the incinerator.

34:04.420 --> 34:06.420
Oh, wow.

34:06.455 --> 34:10.290
Three more bodies.
He burned them.

34:12.495 --> 34:15.562
Look what we
have over here.

34:22.204 --> 34:24.338
Sick bastard.

34:28.487 --> 34:30.713
Four victims, one location.

34:30.833 --> 34:33.501
Does that make this a mass
murderer or a serial killer?

34:33.536 --> 34:36.036
The different levels
of fire damage to the bones

34:36.072 --> 34:37.438
indicate that the bodies burned

34:37.474 --> 34:39.007
for different
amounts of time.

34:39.042 --> 34:40.574
And months apart.

34:40.610 --> 34:42.677
Yeah, that and the creepy
removal of the tattoos.

34:42.713 --> 34:44.446
I'm calling this
a serial killer.

34:44.481 --> 34:46.047
According to
the pelvic structure,

34:46.083 --> 34:47.949
all three sets
of remains are male.

34:47.985 --> 34:51.253
And they all were
killed in the same manner,

34:51.288 --> 34:53.588
as evidenced by
the deep incisions

34:53.623 --> 34:55.824
on their respective
anterior C-6's.

34:55.859 --> 34:57.392
That would
sever the jugular veins.

34:57.427 --> 34:59.361
These guys bled out
on the factory floor.

34:59.396 --> 35:01.896
We'll know more
when the bones are clean,

35:01.932 --> 35:04.866
but there appear to be
symmetrical kerf marks

35:04.901 --> 35:07.702
to the clavicles
and the upper thorax.

35:07.738 --> 35:09.971
Just like Freeman.

35:10.007 --> 35:12.841
The use of
fire and exsanguination

35:12.876 --> 35:14.909
suggests that
these killings could have

35:14.945 --> 35:16.778
a ritualistic component.

35:16.813 --> 35:19.581
So we're looking for crazy.
Well, the killer

35:19.616 --> 35:21.583
could think that his actions
are quite sane.

35:21.618 --> 35:24.886
The Aztecs would cut out their
victims' still-beating hearts

35:24.921 --> 35:26.588
as an offering to the gods,

35:26.623 --> 35:29.691
and they were
celebrated for it.

35:29.726 --> 35:32.294
The religious angle
just got more intense.

35:32.329 --> 35:34.696
I got a hit off
the missing persons database

35:34.731 --> 35:38.500
for this victim-- a priest,
Father Douglas Nabors,

35:38.535 --> 35:41.236
who was reported missing
three months ago.

35:41.271 --> 35:43.338
And what about the other
two sets of remains?

35:43.373 --> 35:45.307
This one is
Ted Widmer,

35:45.342 --> 35:48.076
an escaped convict who was in
the same prison as our victim.

35:48.111 --> 35:49.678
And some of the
guys at the bakery.

35:49.713 --> 35:50.945
Oh, it can't be

35:50.981 --> 35:52.247
a coincidence
that he's here.

35:52.282 --> 35:53.615
I'll try
to scrounge up

35:53.650 --> 35:54.683
some usable tissue.

35:54.718 --> 35:56.284
If the opiates
we found on Freeman

35:56.320 --> 35:58.920
were used on the others,
that may give us a lead.

35:58.955 --> 36:00.755
And I'll keep
trying for an I.D.

36:00.791 --> 36:02.157
on our third victim.

36:07.464 --> 36:09.698
Hey. Come on, come on.
So all this just came in?

36:09.733 --> 36:11.966
Yeah. But I found the prize
in the box right away.

36:12.002 --> 36:13.802
The priest,
Father Nabors, was assigned

36:13.837 --> 36:16.104
to a parish in West Virginia
where Alex Rockwell lived.

36:16.139 --> 36:18.306
Rockwell was an altar boy
there when he was a kid.

36:18.342 --> 36:20.008
Uh, let me guess, he
started breaking the law

36:20.043 --> 36:21.476
when he was
in his teens.

36:21.511 --> 36:23.945
Very good. You should
do this for a living.

36:23.980 --> 36:25.701
Yeah.
Now if we could just find a connection

36:25.749 --> 36:27.615
between Rockwell and Widmer.

36:27.651 --> 36:29.951
They served time together
when they were in Hazelton,

36:29.986 --> 36:31.486
same cell block.

36:31.521 --> 36:32.993
Wait, same time
Connor Freeman was there?

36:32.994 --> 36:33.419
Mm-hmm.

36:33.423 --> 36:35.724
So, looks like
Rockwell just snapped

36:35.759 --> 36:37.559
when he was released,
started killing.

36:37.594 --> 36:39.527
Let's go pick him up.

36:42.666 --> 36:44.232
What is it this time?

36:44.267 --> 36:46.201
Looking for Alex Rockwell.
Alex?

36:46.236 --> 36:47.969
You got to be kidding me.

36:48.004 --> 36:49.504
He and Connor
were close friends.

36:49.539 --> 36:50.939
He is a good man.

36:50.974 --> 36:52.407
He could have never killed him.

36:52.442 --> 36:54.476
Look, we found
three more bodies

36:54.511 --> 36:56.478
where Connor was
being held captive.

36:56.513 --> 36:58.780
Two of them
had connections to Rockwell.

36:58.815 --> 37:00.448
One we're still waiting on.

37:00.484 --> 37:02.751
- God.
- Yeah,

37:02.786 --> 37:04.953
so unless you want
more people to die,

37:04.988 --> 37:08.123
I suggest you let us
talk to Rockwell.

37:08.158 --> 37:09.991
I don't know where he is.

37:10.026 --> 37:12.047
He didn't come in today
and I've been calling.

37:12.071 --> 37:12.728
Hmm.

37:12.729 --> 37:15.063
Why would he do this?
I don't know.

37:15.098 --> 37:16.798
Maybe Connor found out
that Rockwell had been, uh,

37:16.833 --> 37:18.733
slicing and burning people.

37:20.537 --> 37:23.037
Okay, uh, let me
try and contact him,

37:23.073 --> 37:25.407
and I'm gonna let you know
as soon as I do.

37:25.442 --> 37:27.108
Just promise you won't
start shooting.

37:27.144 --> 37:31.112
Well, if he comes peacefully,
no one's gonna get hurt.

37:35.786 --> 37:37.185
So you got something
for me, Bones?

37:37.220 --> 37:39.988
Yes. I just finished
comparing the kerf marks

37:40.023 --> 37:42.190
on the clavicles
of the new victims

37:42.225 --> 37:45.894
with the ones found
on Freeman's remains.

37:45.929 --> 37:47.695
They're identical.
So it's the same knife.

37:47.731 --> 37:49.531
All right, I'm gonna
need that to make a case.

37:49.566 --> 37:51.866
Hodgins said the metallurgical
composition and shape

37:51.902 --> 37:54.803
of the blade suggest
a Northern Indian

37:54.838 --> 37:56.704
ritualistic slaughter knife.

37:56.740 --> 37:58.573
So your theory was correct--

37:58.608 --> 38:01.509
it was, uh,
some kind of sick ceremony.

38:01.545 --> 38:05.647
Angela said the shape is
most likely something like this.

38:05.682 --> 38:07.982
Looks like
a khukuri knife--

38:08.018 --> 38:09.517
weapon of choice in Afghanistan.

38:09.553 --> 38:11.119
That'll definitely do the job.

38:11.154 --> 38:13.755
Rockwell was
stationed there.

38:13.790 --> 38:15.690
Flender sent a text.
He's with Rockwell

38:15.725 --> 38:17.358
at a parking lot
across the river.

38:17.394 --> 38:19.027
I told him we'd text him
when we were in position.

38:19.062 --> 38:20.528
Right, okay. Got to go, Bones.

38:20.564 --> 38:21.429
Be safe, Booth.

38:21.465 --> 38:23.164
Always am.

38:28.004 --> 38:29.404
Alex, hey.

38:29.439 --> 38:31.473
I don't like being
out here like this.

38:31.508 --> 38:33.641
It's okay.
Nobody knows you're here.

38:33.677 --> 38:35.143
Why are you running, Alex?

38:35.178 --> 38:36.611
Are you serious?

38:36.646 --> 38:39.180
I thought you were on my side.
I am.

38:39.216 --> 38:41.149
That's why I think you
should just talk to them.

38:41.184 --> 38:43.351
What's going on, Roger?

38:44.421 --> 38:46.254
Listen to me, Alex.
If you run,

38:46.289 --> 38:48.456
they're not gonna believe you.
You need to talk to them now.

38:48.492 --> 38:51.359
Are they here?
Did you set me up?

38:51.394 --> 38:53.261
Look, I'm on
your side here, Alex.

38:53.296 --> 38:55.063
Alex, Alex, stop...
Shut up, you son of a bitch!

38:55.098 --> 38:57.932
You're coming
with me. Move!

38:57.968 --> 39:00.668
- Rockwell!
- He has a knife in the car!

39:00.704 --> 39:02.604
I don't have a clear shot.
I do.

39:04.975 --> 39:07.342
No. No, he's hit. He's hit!

39:07.377 --> 39:08.710
He's hit.
Please, please.

39:08.745 --> 39:10.311
- Not again.
- It's gonna be okay.

39:10.347 --> 39:12.113
Just wanted to immobilize him.

39:15.118 --> 39:16.651
Booth.

39:16.686 --> 39:19.053
He was one of

39:19.089 --> 39:20.855
the success stories.
You tried.

39:20.891 --> 39:23.558
That's you can do is try.

39:31.501 --> 39:32.901
Well, you know,
you were right, Bones.

39:32.936 --> 39:34.669
Some people are just
missing that little

39:34.704 --> 39:36.905
piece of goodness, and there's
nothing you can do about it.

39:36.940 --> 39:40.875
Not something I want
to be right about.

39:40.911 --> 39:42.744
You okay?

39:42.779 --> 39:44.612
Yeah, fine.

39:44.648 --> 39:46.748
I just, you know...

39:46.783 --> 39:49.684
I never like taking a shot.

39:50.987 --> 39:53.488
Because of that piece
of goodness you have.

39:53.523 --> 39:56.724
You know, his
knife was a match

39:56.760 --> 39:58.293
for the injuries.

39:58.328 --> 39:59.394
Yeah, that's what I heard.
Caroline also

39:59.429 --> 40:00.461
told me it was a tight case.

40:00.497 --> 40:02.664
Very.
Right.

40:02.699 --> 40:04.065
So you ready?

40:04.100 --> 40:05.600
Mm-hmm. How's Flender doing?

40:05.635 --> 40:07.101
He's having
second thoughts,

40:07.137 --> 40:08.803
I think, you know?

40:08.838 --> 40:11.039
I told him the world
would've ended a long time ago

40:11.074 --> 40:12.941
if there weren't more
good people than bad.

40:12.976 --> 40:15.009
Yeah.
You sound like an anthropologist, Booth.

40:15.045 --> 40:17.011
Yeah, look,
that's not gonna make me

40:17.047 --> 40:19.280
hang out in the lab, if that's
what you're thinking, okay?

40:19.316 --> 40:20.077
I didn't say that.

40:20.101 --> 40:21.717
Well, that's kind of
what you're insinuating.

40:21.718 --> 40:23.585
I am staying away from...

40:30.060 --> 40:33.695
They just found five new
glioblastomas in Hamid's brain.

40:33.730 --> 40:36.130
The chemo and
the radiation

40:36.166 --> 40:38.933
aren't working.

40:38.969 --> 40:40.768
I'm so sorry.

40:40.804 --> 40:42.904
Yeah.

40:42.939 --> 40:46.708
I heard about a
new alternative

40:46.743 --> 40:49.243
treatment at Duke.

40:49.279 --> 40:50.712
They implant...

40:50.747 --> 40:54.882
A modified polio vaccine
in the brain. I know.

40:57.087 --> 40:59.253
You've been doing
research, too?

40:59.289 --> 41:01.923
Well, I've printed out
the information for you.

41:01.958 --> 41:04.325
Thank you.

41:04.361 --> 41:07.895
Well, I assume Hamid's gonna be
my brother-in-law one day.

41:07.931 --> 41:11.232
I want you to make sure
I meet him.

41:15.538 --> 41:18.806
I do love you,
you know.

41:18.842 --> 41:20.975
I know.

41:25.548 --> 41:27.849
Why don't we grab
a bite to eat.

41:32.555 --> 41:35.023
Cam.

41:35.058 --> 41:37.392
What?

41:37.427 --> 41:40.294
I booked a flight, Cam.

41:40.330 --> 41:42.530
It leaves in a few hours.

41:42.565 --> 41:44.799
Oh.

41:44.834 --> 41:46.768
I...

41:46.803 --> 41:48.736
I thought I was ready.

41:48.772 --> 41:51.172
I'm sorry it was so fast.
No, it's-its...

41:51.207 --> 41:52.640
okay.

41:52.676 --> 41:54.242
I'm fine. I...

41:56.112 --> 41:58.646
You just...

41:58.682 --> 42:01.382
I will.

42:09.292 --> 42:11.726
You come back
to me, Arastoo.

42:12.700 --> 42:14.333
Make sure
you come back.
