00:05.160 --> 00:07.200
Misha!

00:07.280 --> 00:11.360
Drowned, maybe a week ago.
Hard to tell in the cold water.

00:11.440 --> 00:14.680
-Any burns on the body?
-No, why?

00:14.760 --> 00:17.920
We found a burnt-out boat.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.680
-And you think there's a connection?
-We don't know.

00:21.760 --> 00:25.280
If there is, there were others
on the boat.

00:25.360 --> 00:27.480
Here's to Kim!

00:27.560 --> 00:32.400
-Did you work when you were away?
-No, Fredrik had lots of money.

00:36.840 --> 00:40.600
-Is she back?
-We'll talk tomorrow. I'll come by.

00:46.240 --> 00:51.080
5,000 euro. I hope there won't be
any other unforeseen expenses.

00:51.160 --> 00:55.240
You can be trusted, Lasse.
I can tell.

00:55.320 --> 00:58.440
What's the great urgency?

01:02.800 --> 01:04.760
Your father...

01:04.840 --> 01:08.040
My brother.
I want the truth from you lot.

01:08.120 --> 01:11.880
Dad was an alcoholic.
He must have fallen in.

01:11.960 --> 01:16.680
Rotten luck he had, to fall
straight into a plastic sack.

01:16.760 --> 01:22.280
Anna-Lisa killed him. And I know
that you took care of his body!

01:22.360 --> 01:24.880
You dug it up last summer!

01:24.960 --> 01:28.080
Konrad... He needs to go.

01:37.880 --> 01:42.280
Here... Take this and leave us alone.
There's 50,000 euros there.

01:42.360 --> 01:47.520
And you shut your trap now.
I don't want to hear a word from you.

02:41.880 --> 02:44.680
Look what I found.

02:45.800 --> 02:48.720
She won't mind us borrowing it.

02:50.040 --> 02:53.600
-Who?
-Cecilia. It belongs to her.

02:57.360 --> 03:00.760
-Aren't you going to eat?
-I'm not hungry.

04:15.920 --> 04:19.560
THICKER THAN WATER

05:15.240 --> 05:17.200
-Hi.
-Hi.

05:17.280 --> 05:19.720
-Been out for a run?
-Yes.

05:19.800 --> 05:25.000
You have to do the afternoon shift.
Lasse has to run some errands.

05:25.080 --> 05:27.160
Sure, I'll do it.

05:27.240 --> 05:29.080
-Hi.
-Hi.

05:31.840 --> 05:35.800
Last summer you could barely get her
to cut up an onion.

05:35.880 --> 05:39.200
-She will follow in dad's footsteps.
-I hope not.

05:39.280 --> 05:42.400
-She'll go further.
-Shopping list.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.080
Catch!

05:47.920 --> 05:51.680
Any more snow
and we'll have to rent a snowplough.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.560
What?

05:56.240 --> 05:58.680
Konrad won't bother us again.

05:58.760 --> 06:02.360
-How do you know?
-I just do.

06:39.640 --> 06:41.680
Aren't you cold?

06:46.240 --> 06:50.360
This is where I stood when I told you
I was pregnant with Cecilia.

06:51.320 --> 06:54.120
-This very spot.
-Yes.

06:54.800 --> 06:58.480
-I remember.
-I was so nervous.

06:58.560 --> 07:01.240
I thought you'd ask me
to get rid of it.

07:01.320 --> 07:04.200
-That you'd say we were too young.
-We weren't.

07:04.280 --> 07:06.120
We were.

07:07.440 --> 07:09.840
But we managed.

07:12.200 --> 07:15.760
-She's so lovely.
-She's perfect.

07:17.040 --> 07:20.800
Cecilia is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

07:20.880 --> 07:26.760
Whatever happens,
I'll always love you for that.

08:02.520 --> 08:05.000
Hiya. Eskil, isn't it?

08:05.600 --> 08:06.920
Hi.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.920
What are you doing here?
Missed the bus?

08:10.000 --> 08:13.280
I tried to phone mum,
but my battery is flat.

08:13.360 --> 08:16.960
The next bus is in an hour.

08:18.440 --> 08:22.560
-Get in, I'll take you home.
-You don't know the way.

08:22.640 --> 08:25.080
You'll have to show me.

08:25.160 --> 08:27.840
Mum says I shouldn't
go with strangers.

08:29.560 --> 08:31.840
That's great.

08:31.920 --> 08:36.880
But we're nearly friends. I've
talked to your mum lots of times.

08:36.960 --> 08:38.560
Jump in!

08:39.360 --> 08:42.120
Give me your backpack.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.960
Doing anything fun at school?

08:49.040 --> 08:52.760
-Space.
-I see. Do you like it?

08:52.840 --> 08:55.760
Did you know that
for each grain of sand on Earth

08:55.840 --> 08:59.480
there are at least 10,000 stars
in the universe?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.880
That many?

09:02.680 --> 09:07.760
There's a crater on Mercury
called Dostoevsky.

09:08.800 --> 09:13.360
-Like the Russian writer?
-He wrote "Crime and Punishment".

09:13.440 --> 09:16.280
Don't tell me you've read it?

09:18.360 --> 09:20.000
I've got one.

09:20.080 --> 09:24.840
Move every other year or stay
in Åland for the rest of your life?

09:24.920 --> 09:28.720
That's not exactly difficult.
More beetroot salad, please.

09:28.800 --> 09:31.960
What if you find your favourite place
and have to move?

09:32.040 --> 09:35.440
At least you'll have been there
for two years.

09:35.520 --> 09:39.680
Experienced a bit more
than am-dram in Åland.

09:39.760 --> 09:44.160
In Vietnam we had a rule never to
stay anywhere longer than a week.

09:44.240 --> 09:47.720
-Sounds great.
-Yes, for a while.

09:51.040 --> 09:55.600
-Fredrik is back home.
-What makes you think that?

09:55.680 --> 09:58.800
The lights are on in Mildred's house.

09:58.880 --> 10:01.720
-Are you going over?
-I don't know.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.920
You have to talk to him.

10:07.920 --> 10:13.920
One more: Be murdered with a frozen
turd or choke between two buttocks?

10:14.000 --> 10:15.560
You're sick.

10:24.280 --> 10:27.080
Oh, here's Eskil now. Thanks, bye.

10:28.320 --> 10:31.240
Hello, sweetie. What happened to you?

10:32.360 --> 10:36.400
He missed the bus so I gave him
a lift. Hope that's okay.

10:36.480 --> 10:40.320
-Nice of you.
-No problem. Here's his backpack.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.200
Thanks.

10:42.280 --> 10:46.400
-Would you like some coffee?
-Yes, please.

10:47.520 --> 10:51.080
-Did you bake?
-No, Eskil did.

10:53.760 --> 10:57.360
Tell me he hasn't read Dostoevsky.

10:57.440 --> 11:00.000
He has. We read him every night.

11:03.040 --> 11:05.440
-Do you live alone?
-Yes.

11:07.480 --> 11:12.720
-Are you divorced or separated?
-Widowed.

11:15.320 --> 11:17.400
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

11:18.280 --> 11:19.920
It was a long time ago.

11:21.960 --> 11:24.880
Do you ever get over it?

11:24.960 --> 11:27.400
His death, yes.

11:27.480 --> 11:31.880
-That I married him, never.
-The phone is ringing, mum.

11:33.160 --> 11:36.080
Excuse me. Laura speaking.

11:39.480 --> 11:42.800
-One moment.
-Are you good at this?

11:42.880 --> 11:46.360
-Is it one of those rubric cubes?
-A Rubik's Cube.

11:46.440 --> 11:48.800
Right, that's it.

11:48.880 --> 11:52.560
Each side has to be the same colour.
It's hard.

11:52.640 --> 11:55.240
I suppose there's a system.

12:07.080 --> 12:09.840
What are you looking at?

12:09.920 --> 12:13.840
I was thinking of the system.
Let's have a look.

12:14.680 --> 12:17.200
You start with one side.

12:17.280 --> 12:19.920
Try the red first.

12:27.040 --> 12:30.600
-Look, mum.
-Wow, that's great.

12:30.680 --> 12:34.200
I'd better get going.

12:34.280 --> 12:37.000
Why don't you
come to dinner some time?

12:37.080 --> 12:41.040
-By way of thanks for the lift.
-Sure.

12:41.120 --> 12:43.920
-See you.
-Bye.

13:01.560 --> 13:02.960
What's up?

13:04.760 --> 13:08.360
I thought I saw something,
but it must have been a deer.

13:34.800 --> 13:40.080
Where's that contract? I want to
get going. I've given you the money.

13:40.160 --> 13:43.960
-There's a bit of a problem...
-What kind of a problem?

14:11.320 --> 14:13.520
Lasse...

14:18.040 --> 14:22.000
What's going on?
I feel like I'm being left out.

14:22.080 --> 14:26.840
Oskar is so unstable.
One minute he's totally distracted...

14:26.920 --> 14:32.520
I think he feels unsure of you.
He was so upset when you were gone.

14:33.560 --> 14:36.000
What should I do?

14:36.080 --> 14:38.680
Just wait to be forgiven?

14:39.520 --> 14:42.120
-He'll get there.
-Do you think so?

14:43.440 --> 14:45.520
I know.

14:49.360 --> 14:52.920
-What?
-You're different somehow.

14:53.600 --> 14:57.720
-How so?
-You came here and cared for Oskar.

14:57.800 --> 15:03.560
You've invested - not just the money
but your time and interest.

15:03.640 --> 15:08.040
-Was that so unthinkable?
-Yes, it was.

15:09.920 --> 15:11.680
But I was wrong.

15:12.440 --> 15:14.320
I was wrong about you.

15:22.240 --> 15:27.440
Sorry about this, but you tried to
buy a boat with counterfeit money.

15:27.520 --> 15:32.760
-How do you know it's counterfeit?
-You can tell by the serial numbers.

15:32.840 --> 15:36.040
They're identical on all the notes.

15:37.960 --> 15:40.640
Where did you get it, Konrad?

15:40.720 --> 15:43.360
I had no idea it was counterfeit.

15:43.440 --> 15:46.840
How could I know?
I've never seen it before.

15:46.920 --> 15:49.760
-Who gave it to you?
-No one.

15:52.080 --> 15:56.960
You got it somewhere.
We're talking about 50,000 euros.

15:57.040 --> 16:00.400
You do know it's a criminal offence?

16:00.480 --> 16:02.600
I found it.

16:02.680 --> 16:05.800
-Where?
-On the ice.

16:05.880 --> 16:10.720
Down by the old pier. It was just
lying there, so I took it.

16:14.240 --> 16:19.120
-So it was here?
-Yes, it was the dog that found it.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.240
-So the money was on the ice?
-Yes.

16:24.320 --> 16:28.320
They were wrapped up...
in a plastic bag.

16:28.400 --> 16:31.160
-Is there any more?
-Hell, no.

16:32.200 --> 16:35.000
I was going to spend it all.

16:35.080 --> 16:37.840
Finally I could get a decent boat.

16:37.920 --> 16:42.200
It's against the law to keep
money you find. You know that.

16:46.680 --> 16:52.120
Don't go anywhere. Don't leave Åland
until the investigation is over.

16:52.200 --> 16:54.920
-Okay?
-Okay.

17:09.920 --> 17:11.320
Welcome.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.720
Oskar!

17:22.280 --> 17:25.240
Where the hell is your brother?
I need to see him.

17:27.080 --> 17:29.320
Go to the office.

17:37.400 --> 17:40.920
-What do you want?
-The police came.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.920
-You tricked me, you bastard!
-What do you mean?

17:44.000 --> 17:47.920
Were you in on it?
I can't imagine that Jonna was.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.720
-In on what?
-I'm sure there's a diagnosis for it.

17:51.800 --> 17:55.600
-We're done with each other.
-It's counterfeit money.

17:55.680 --> 17:59.440
50,000 in counterfeit fucking money!

17:59.520 --> 18:02.320
-What money?
-Hang on.

18:02.400 --> 18:07.240
-What did you tell the police?
-They wanted to know where I got it.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.720
I told them I found it on the ice.

18:09.800 --> 18:13.400
-I can easily change that story...
-What's this about?

18:15.360 --> 18:18.360
So you weren't in on it?

18:18.440 --> 18:22.120
Lasse gave me 50,000 euros
to shut up.

18:22.200 --> 18:27.360
But the money was as fake as him.
Dishonesty, that's your diagnosis.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.320
-What will you do?
-I'll go now.

18:30.400 --> 18:35.520
But I'll be back, count on that.
And then I'll be calling the shots.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.960
Then I want the truth.

18:38.040 --> 18:41.760
Or I'll tell the police
everything I know.

18:41.840 --> 18:45.320
And your reputation
won't be the only thing at stake.

18:51.160 --> 18:54.600
There never was any insurance money,
was there?

18:55.840 --> 18:57.120
It was from the boat.

18:58.360 --> 19:01.560
You found the money
on the burning boat.

19:01.640 --> 19:05.840
I was only trying to spare you,
Oskar. I did it for you.

19:08.160 --> 19:11.240
I didn't know it was fake money!

20:09.200 --> 20:11.400
Are you going to say anything?

20:13.920 --> 20:17.560
-Well, are you?
-I found a bag with money.

20:17.640 --> 20:21.520
-Then I used it. What's unclear?
-Why did you lie to us?

20:23.000 --> 20:25.840
-I didn't want you two mixed up.
-But now we are.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.800
It's criminal money.

20:27.880 --> 20:30.880
-Someone will want it back.
-No.

20:31.480 --> 20:35.560
There was no one on the boat,
he must have drowned.

20:35.640 --> 20:38.120
The police suspect foul play.

20:38.200 --> 20:43.400
We've paid for stuff with fake money.
They'll trace it right back to us.

20:43.480 --> 20:47.520
-I didn't know it was fake.
-That's irrelevant!

20:48.240 --> 20:51.800
-Is there any money left?
-No.

20:51.880 --> 20:54.800
So Konrad is our biggest problem.

20:56.240 --> 21:00.320
-We'll get done for this.
-Not if Konrad keeps quiet.

21:01.040 --> 21:03.360
But Wille...

21:03.920 --> 21:05.960
The advance he got.

21:06.040 --> 21:09.800
-Best if you ask for it back, Jonna.
-No way.

21:09.880 --> 21:12.280
-Jonna, please.
-No!

21:14.200 --> 21:17.440
We have a packed restaurant
out there.

21:18.600 --> 21:22.640
-There's only me and Kim.
-I'm coming.

21:27.480 --> 21:31.080
-Oskar, are you coming?
-In a minute.

21:52.560 --> 21:54.320
Hi...

21:54.400 --> 21:56.760
I have to tell you something...

22:00.720 --> 22:04.880
-Why the hell do you want it back?
-Can we talk later?

22:04.960 --> 22:09.240
No, now. Do you know
how expensive the materials are?

22:09.320 --> 22:11.760
-It's counterfeit.
-What is?

22:11.840 --> 22:15.480
-The money.
-What the hell are you up to?

22:15.560 --> 22:19.320
-I can't explain now.
-That's 5,000 euros.

22:20.800 --> 22:23.760
Come and see me tonight
and we'll talk.

22:25.880 --> 22:27.200
Please?

22:29.160 --> 22:30.280
Okay.

22:31.520 --> 22:32.720
Thanks.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.360
Oskar!

22:50.080 --> 22:51.840
Where the hell are you going?

23:00.240 --> 23:02.840
-Please tell me what you're doing.
-Oskar!

23:03.480 --> 23:07.280
What? What is it, my dear brother?

23:36.280 --> 23:38.880
What the hell is this?

23:38.960 --> 23:44.000
-How much is in there? How much?
-400,000 euros.

23:44.080 --> 23:46.840
-It was, before...
-You promised.

23:46.920 --> 23:50.760
You solemnly swore, Lasse!
You bloody idiot!

23:50.840 --> 23:52.560
What are you mixed up in?

23:53.720 --> 23:57.600
I was asked to take care of the bag.
I didn't know what was in it.

23:57.680 --> 24:02.440
And when you found out?
Didn't you think you should tell us?

24:02.520 --> 24:05.840
-I didn't want to get you mixed up...
-Very kind.

24:05.920 --> 24:08.040
I did it for your sake, okay?

24:08.120 --> 24:11.000
Did you lie about the amount
for our sake, too?

24:12.520 --> 24:15.200
This bloody money has to go, Lasse!

24:16.360 --> 24:21.880
-It's a whole lot of money...
-It's worthless! Where is it from?

24:21.960 --> 24:25.480
-The boat.
-Come on, where did you get it?

24:25.560 --> 24:27.720
I was trying to help you.

24:27.800 --> 24:31.800
If this is what you call helping,
we don't want it!

24:31.880 --> 24:33.280
Bloody idiot.

24:37.440 --> 24:42.400
-Is the other thing in the bag yours?
-You don't think...

24:42.480 --> 24:45.360
-Never mind.
-Of course it's not mine!

25:04.840 --> 25:06.720
Well look at this.

25:06.800 --> 25:08.800
This is where you are!

25:08.880 --> 25:14.640
Soon you'll be stuffing your faces
and drinking aquavit.

25:14.720 --> 25:18.000
Enjoying all the Christmas food!

25:18.080 --> 25:22.480
Did you know my brother Mauritz
used to live here?

25:22.560 --> 25:25.040
He repaired the whole bloody thing.

25:25.120 --> 25:30.080
But then one night he just
disappeared. He disappeared.

25:30.160 --> 25:35.000
Mauritz... No one saw him
or knows where he got to.

25:35.080 --> 25:38.360
There's a rumour his wife did him in.

25:42.320 --> 25:47.800
They'll burn in hell
for what they've done. All of them!

25:47.880 --> 25:51.360
You can hear him coming. Mauritz.

25:51.440 --> 25:55.280
-Have you heard him...
-Your table is ready.

25:55.360 --> 25:58.320
-Liv!
-Why are you bothering the guests?

25:58.400 --> 26:02.040
Why are you here?
You're better than them.

26:02.120 --> 26:06.400
You're smart, you don't need them.
Just leave!

26:06.480 --> 26:09.560
Go home now. We can talk tomorrow.

26:09.640 --> 26:12.480
You're not infected
by their venom yet.

26:12.560 --> 26:14.240
Hi.

26:14.320 --> 26:17.320
-I have to ask you to leave.
-Or what?

26:17.400 --> 26:22.040
-Will you send Oskar after me?
-Or I'll call the police.

26:22.120 --> 26:24.720
Go ahead, call the police!

26:24.800 --> 26:27.280
Great, then I can tell them...

26:27.360 --> 26:32.440
I'm trying to tell your guests
who lives here, where they're eating!

26:32.520 --> 26:34.520
-Come on.
-Let go of me!

26:34.600 --> 26:37.560
You bloody coward!

26:37.640 --> 26:41.920
That cowardice - you have it
from your mother!

26:42.000 --> 26:44.720
She was exactly the same.

26:44.800 --> 26:48.080
She went behind Mauritz's back
all the time.

26:48.160 --> 26:50.720
You'd better calm down.

26:50.800 --> 26:53.640
You'll get the truth,
but leave the guests alone.

26:53.720 --> 26:56.840
-If you don't...
-Think you can scare me?

26:56.920 --> 27:01.480
-You can't hurt me!
-Hey, guys, that's enough now.

27:01.560 --> 27:05.160
Hi Konrad. Just calm down, my friend.

27:05.240 --> 27:08.400
-How's it going?
-Hello, Jonna.

27:08.480 --> 27:11.760
-Have you had a few drinks, maybe?
-Oh yes...

27:13.960 --> 27:18.040
Let's go in here
so you can sit down and have a rest.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.240
-Everything okay?
-Not at all.

27:28.320 --> 27:30.560
What's with Konrad?

27:30.640 --> 27:35.440
-He's always been a bit crazy.
-Not like this, he hasn't.

27:35.520 --> 27:39.520
-Did you argue while I was away?
-No.

27:39.600 --> 27:41.480
No?

27:44.680 --> 27:50.920
I can walk by myself! You should
watch that witch's spawn instead.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.720
Go home now, Konrad. Don't go away.

28:01.240 --> 28:03.840
-What did he say?
-What?

28:03.920 --> 28:06.880
I mean... What's happened?

28:06.960 --> 28:10.520
Konrad's had a bit too much to drink
and was scaring your guests.

28:10.600 --> 28:13.320
-It's all good now.
-All right.

28:13.400 --> 28:18.320
I wanted to ask you
if you'd received any fake notes?

28:20.360 --> 28:25.240
-No, why would we?
-We have some fake notes circulating.

28:26.360 --> 28:29.600
No, not as far as I'm aware.

28:29.680 --> 28:31.720
Good to hear.

28:31.800 --> 28:34.080
-Bye, then.
-Bye.

28:34.160 --> 28:36.200
Hey, Lasse...

28:37.320 --> 28:40.840
Do you like mushrooms?
You're not allergic?

28:40.920 --> 28:43.280
No. Is that possible?

28:43.360 --> 28:46.080
I don't know. My son says so.

28:47.720 --> 28:50.520
-Okay, speak soon.
-See you.

28:57.240 --> 29:00.360
-What's with the cop?
-Nothing.

29:22.360 --> 29:24.280
I understand you're angry.

29:27.720 --> 29:32.520
You promised me there wouldn't be
any trouble this time.

29:32.600 --> 29:34.000
Remember?

29:42.720 --> 29:47.640
But you keep lying and lying.
And do you know what?

29:47.720 --> 29:53.080
I get why Konrad is fed up
with the lying, because so am I.

29:56.680 --> 29:58.800
If you won't tell him, I will.

29:58.880 --> 30:04.960
-Do you think Konrad will understand?
-That doesn't matter anymore.

30:05.040 --> 30:08.080
Oskar can't be tried for it,
it was too long ago.

30:08.160 --> 30:11.640
What will Liv and Cecilia say?
Do you even care?

30:11.720 --> 30:13.440
They'll forgive him.

30:19.840 --> 30:24.360
-Dad was his brother.
-He nearly killed both me and Oskar.

30:24.440 --> 30:28.560
-He had good qualities, too.
-That only you saw.

30:31.520 --> 30:35.120
It's always been
so bloody easy for you.

30:37.200 --> 30:40.600
What would my life have been like
if it had been me?

30:40.680 --> 30:45.000
Maybe then I'd also be able
to understand and forgive.

30:45.080 --> 30:47.960
I know it was shit for you, Lasse.

30:49.120 --> 30:51.040
I know.

30:52.480 --> 30:56.360
-But it was a long time ago.
-It doesn't go away.

30:57.840 --> 30:59.920
It never goes away.

31:01.640 --> 31:03.160
No...

31:06.720 --> 31:11.800
But how long can you go on blaming
all your mistakes on a bad childhood?

31:36.960 --> 31:40.280
-Did you say anything?
-Shit, you scared me!

31:43.760 --> 31:48.000
-About what?
-About what happened between us.

31:53.160 --> 31:56.000
He knows we kissed.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.920
But that's all I've told him.

32:02.720 --> 32:06.920
Do you know what it feels like
to be away for long time,

32:07.000 --> 32:11.400
have new and different experiences,
but when you return,

32:11.480 --> 32:15.320
everyone has changed,
everyone except you?

32:16.120 --> 32:17.960
I know too well.

32:19.480 --> 32:22.880
That's how I felt
when I came back here.

32:22.960 --> 32:28.280
You, Oskar and Jonna.
Everyone had found their place.

32:28.360 --> 32:32.040
-Everyone except me.
-It's not like that any more.

32:32.120 --> 32:35.040
Maybe it hasn't changed
as much as you think.

32:35.720 --> 32:38.880
-Hasn't it?
-No, as you can see...

32:38.960 --> 32:43.600
I walk around tidying,
drinking left-over wine...

32:44.080 --> 32:46.920
And I'm waiting
for your shift to end.

32:49.000 --> 32:53.120
It's just like 20 years ago.
Nothing ever changes.

32:56.840 --> 33:00.520
Like some feelings won't go away
just because you want them to.

33:13.080 --> 33:15.600
-Good night.
-Night.

33:48.240 --> 33:50.080
-Hi.
-Hi.

33:50.160 --> 33:52.400
The door was open.
I can come back later.

33:52.480 --> 33:54.040
No, it's fine.

33:55.520 --> 33:58.720
-What's happened?
-The money was Lasse's.

33:58.800 --> 34:00.880
We didn't know it was fake.

34:00.960 --> 34:04.440
-Never mind that. Why are you sad?
-I'm not.

34:04.520 --> 34:08.280
-I can tell that you are.
-Can we stick to the subject, please?

34:08.360 --> 34:12.240
You work for me, that's it.
My life is none of your business.

34:13.880 --> 34:15.440
Okay.

34:21.160 --> 34:23.080
I'm sorry.

34:25.360 --> 34:28.960
I don't know what I'm doing.
I want you.

34:30.520 --> 34:32.160
What did you say?

34:33.320 --> 34:35.040
I want you.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.440
Say it again.

34:58.080 --> 35:03.160
"It does not delight in evil
but rejoices with the truth."

35:03.240 --> 35:10.080
"It always protects, always trusts,
always hopes, always perseveres."

35:10.680 --> 35:12.680
"Love never fails."

36:20.240 --> 36:22.880
I need your help, mum.

36:24.360 --> 36:28.400
You always knew what to do.
You had all the answers.

36:37.680 --> 36:40.520
You know what you have to do, Oskar.

36:40.600 --> 36:42.520
You know it.

36:42.600 --> 36:44.520
It's you or him.

37:23.280 --> 37:25.480
-What are you doing?
-Sorting this out.

37:25.560 --> 37:26.360
What?

37:26.440 --> 37:28.720
-Out of my way.
-Take it easy.

37:28.800 --> 37:30.720
What's going on?

37:30.800 --> 37:34.000
You don't get it.
He'll never give up.

37:34.080 --> 37:37.920
The old bastard thinks
he can push us around as he likes.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.840
-Calm down.
-Jonna, wait!

37:42.240 --> 37:44.320
-Sit down!
-Let go.

37:44.400 --> 37:46.840
Sit the fuck down!

37:46.920 --> 37:48.760
It's him or me.

37:50.600 --> 37:54.080
What the hell's got into you?
Calm down!

37:55.360 --> 37:56.920
Okay?

37:58.160 --> 38:01.280
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.520
Good.

38:10.280 --> 38:11.720
Oskar!

38:31.760 --> 38:33.600
-Hi.
-Hi.

38:36.320 --> 38:39.800
-How's the fishing going?
-There's no bad fishing.

38:39.880 --> 38:42.080
Only a bad catch.

38:42.160 --> 38:44.520
-Remember who said that?
-Yes.

38:50.120 --> 38:54.160
It's only when I'm with you
that I can say I miss him.

38:57.760 --> 38:59.120
Thanks.

39:08.680 --> 39:12.600
What was the name of the dog
that bit me when I was little?

39:12.680 --> 39:15.000
-Brutus.
-That's it, Brutus.

39:15.080 --> 39:18.760
-I had to put the poor thing down.
-I remember.

39:18.840 --> 39:20.800
I cried so much.

39:20.880 --> 39:24.800
-I thought it was my fault.
-Was it heck.

39:24.880 --> 39:29.800
The dog wasn't right.
Too many beatings by the old owner.

39:29.880 --> 39:33.240
Maybe the old owner
should've been put down.

39:43.560 --> 39:45.720
You know he beat her.

39:50.760 --> 39:56.320
If you mean your mother, she
cheated on him and humiliated him.

39:56.400 --> 39:59.760
What did my brothers do
to deserve such beatings?

39:59.840 --> 40:04.840
Your brothers weren't exactly angels.
It was hard to live with Anna-Lisa.

40:04.920 --> 40:09.480
-He didn't even get a funeral.
-He's in your bloody shed now.

40:09.560 --> 40:12.080
-How is that dignified?
-You know why.

40:12.160 --> 40:15.960
I want to know the truth.
Do you understand that?

40:16.040 --> 40:19.440
-I do understand that.
-So how did it happen?

40:20.400 --> 40:23.240
-He wasn't murdered.
-So what happened?

40:26.400 --> 40:28.080
Jonna...

40:30.400 --> 40:33.480
-It was an accident.
-An accident?

40:33.560 --> 40:37.280
Oskar was only 16,
and he was trying to protect mum.

40:37.360 --> 40:38.440
Oskar!

40:41.360 --> 40:43.840
He was a child.

40:43.920 --> 40:47.160
You have to forgive him,
he was only a child!

40:48.400 --> 40:51.080
-Konrad, for fuck's...
-Stay there!

40:51.160 --> 40:55.240
You have to forgive him!
He was trying to protect mum!

40:58.840 --> 41:01.200
Go ahead and shoot!

41:01.280 --> 41:03.080
He was only a child!

41:05.480 --> 41:07.000
Lasse...

41:07.080 --> 41:08.920
-Let go...
-Jonna!

41:15.320 --> 41:16.680
Drop it!

41:27.920 --> 41:29.520
Jonna!

41:29.920 --> 41:32.920
-Are you okay?
-Help him! Help him!

41:44.280 --> 41:47.960
Help him, Oskar! Let go of me!

41:53.640 --> 41:55.040
Help him!

42:49.840 --> 42:53.840
