<i> On the last episode of Alf..</i>

00:03.604 --> 00:05.637
Thanksgiving on Melmac

00:05.639 --> 00:07.539
wasn't called thanksgiving.

00:07.541 --> 00:10.809
It was called fappiano.

00:10.811 --> 00:12.644
And we didn't eat turkey.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.780
Instead, we sat down

00:14.782 --> 00:17.916
to a nice, big,
juicy, stuffed...

00:17.918 --> 00:20.686
Time out! We know exactly
what you're gonna say, ALF.

00:20.688 --> 00:23.155
And you know that
we find that offensive.

00:23.157 --> 00:24.390
What was I gonna say?

00:24.392 --> 00:27.860
Cat! Big, juicy, stuffed..

00:29.163 --> 00:30.729
...cat.

00:30.731 --> 00:33.232
I was always partial
to the dark meat.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.600
[instrumental music]

00:34.602 --> 00:36.602
Sweet potato pie?

00:36.604 --> 00:38.604
No, thank you, Ed, uh..

00:38.606 --> 00:40.039
...whatever your name is.

00:40.041 --> 00:43.308
Uh, Flakey Pete.
My friends call me Flakey Pete.

00:43.310 --> 00:44.710
Or Flakey Pete Finnegan.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.845
But mostly,
my friends don't call me

00:46.847 --> 00:49.048
'cause I don't have a phone.

00:50.618 --> 00:53.285
Well, I'm Willie Tanner.

00:53.287 --> 00:55.587
And this..

00:55.589 --> 00:57.623
...this is my garage.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.458
And that's..

00:59.460 --> 01:01.260
...probably your crowbar.

01:02.997 --> 01:04.830
Yes, it is.

01:04.832 --> 01:06.832
And that's my sweater.

01:08.502 --> 01:09.735
Were you..

01:09.737 --> 01:13.038
Were you planning
on...keeping it?

01:13.040 --> 01:14.540
I was..

01:14.542 --> 01:16.909
...until I saw the crowbar.

01:16.911 --> 01:19.144
- I'm not gonna use it.
- Oh, well..

01:19.146 --> 01:23.282
Well, then, I'd-I'd
like to keep the sweater.

01:23.284 --> 01:27.219
(Lynn)
'...Dudley. I think
I'd rather sit next to Jake.'

01:27.221 --> 01:30.055
(Lynn)
This guy that I used
to take a bath with..

01:30.057 --> 01:32.357
[laughing]

01:32.359 --> 01:33.725
I smuggled you some dessert.

01:33.727 --> 01:35.994
Oh, goody, goody, goody!

01:37.898 --> 01:38.931
[sighs]

01:40.568 --> 01:41.934
What is it?

01:41.936 --> 01:42.968
Guess.

01:44.505 --> 01:45.871
Rubber vomit.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.074
Pumpkin Jell-O.

01:49.076 --> 01:51.677
I have to get back
to the Ochmoneks.

01:51.679 --> 01:53.946
While Uncle Rocky
is carving the turkey

01:53.948 --> 01:56.582
Mr. and Mrs. Ochmonek
are going to be singing

01:56.584 --> 01:59.685
"Das Cornucopia" from
Wagner Strauss'

01:59.687 --> 02:01.587
"Der Feaster Famine."

02:01.589 --> 02:03.622
It's an Ochmonek tradition.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.257
Well, thanks for the warning.

02:05.259 --> 02:07.593
I'll watch for breaking glass.

02:09.697 --> 02:11.029
Thanks, operator.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.170
Happy Thanksgiving,
Alien Task Force

Sgt. Fox speaking.

02:19.573 --> 02:20.672
Hello.

02:20.674 --> 02:23.642
I think I've just seen an alien.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.244
What do I do?

02:26.180 --> 02:29.181
[theme music]

[music continues]

03:41.655 --> 03:42.921
Hello.

03:47.161 --> 03:48.827
[barking]

03:50.397 --> 03:53.799
There's, uh, no need to pretend.

03:53.801 --> 03:56.068
I'm not...gonna hurt you.

03:56.070 --> 03:59.238
And I'm sure you're not gonna..

03:59.240 --> 04:00.772
...hurt me.

04:02.243 --> 04:03.875
[barking]

04:05.546 --> 04:07.346
Oh! It's okay.

04:08.949 --> 04:12.351
I'm friendly...so are you.

04:12.353 --> 04:13.452
[whimpering]

04:14.989 --> 04:17.689
Look, I know you can talk.

04:17.691 --> 04:19.291
I heard ya.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.160
Ruh-roh.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.696
Relax.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.431
I'm a friend of Willie's.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.767
You're that bum who's
been hanging around

04:28.769 --> 04:30.435
our trash cans.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.772
Hey! Huh.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.841
Bums have friends.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.277
How do you know Willie?

04:38.279 --> 04:41.580
I was talking to him just, uh,
a-a, a minute ago.

04:41.582 --> 04:42.848
[clears throat]

04:42.850 --> 04:45.851
About this tall,
glasses, social worker.

04:45.853 --> 04:47.386
That's Willie.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.354
Oh, well, he-he's the one who..

04:49.356 --> 04:50.956
...told me to..

04:51.659 --> 04:53.792
...come in here and..

04:53.794 --> 04:55.694
...keep you company.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.596
Willie told you about me?

04:57.598 --> 05:00.866
Ah, well, not...specifically

05:00.868 --> 05:03.502
which planet you're from but,
uh..

05:03.504 --> 05:07.005
...I figure it's a cold planet
because of your fur.

05:07.007 --> 05:09.941
Your feet are suited
to a muddy terrain.

05:09.943 --> 05:11.877
They're probably reddish-brown

05:11.879 --> 05:14.513
so that you'd, uh, blend in.

05:15.949 --> 05:18.717
Your large ears suggest

05:18.719 --> 05:20.185
a thin atmosphere

05:20.187 --> 05:22.821
that doesn't transmit
sound waves very well.

05:22.823 --> 05:26.425
And the big nose indicates
a scarcity of oxygen.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.126
Hey!

05:28.128 --> 05:30.595
Watch the wisecracks
about the schnoz.

05:30.597 --> 05:33.465
Oh, uh, uh, sorry.
No offense, uh, intended.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.133
It's a lovely schnoz.

05:35.135 --> 05:36.468
Thank you.

05:36.470 --> 05:37.969
Yours is nice too.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.938
Thank you. So, let's see.

05:39.940 --> 05:43.475
I'd, uh, I'd guess
you were from planet..

05:44.378 --> 05:45.877
...K-171.

05:46.714 --> 05:48.180
K-171?

05:48.916 --> 05:50.582
Oh, you mean Neesbeck.

05:50.584 --> 05:53.985
Hah! There's no
intelligent life on Neesbeck!

05:54.621 --> 05:55.887
How do you know?

05:55.889 --> 05:57.789
I've been there.

05:57.791 --> 06:00.258
Their national bird is dust.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.862
Well, then what planet
are you from?

06:04.365 --> 06:05.697
Melmac.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.600
But don't spread it around,
okay?

06:08.602 --> 06:10.502
You can trust me.

06:10.504 --> 06:11.770
Good.

06:11.772 --> 06:13.138
You have any idea
what would happen

06:13.140 --> 06:15.941
if people found out about me?

06:15.943 --> 06:17.542
I can't imagine.

06:17.544 --> 06:22.180
Have you ever heard of the
Alien Task Force?

06:22.182 --> 06:25.484
Alien Task...Force?
No, I don't believe I have.

06:25.486 --> 06:26.785
What do they do?

06:26.787 --> 06:29.221
Well, they hunt down
innocent aliens..

06:29.223 --> 06:30.856
...and do bad..

06:30.858 --> 06:33.425
...bad things to them.

06:33.427 --> 06:34.793
How do you know?

06:34.795 --> 06:37.529
Interstellar grapevine.

06:37.531 --> 06:40.532
[singing in foreign language]

06:47.408 --> 06:48.440
[cymbal chimes]

07:05.292 --> 07:07.459
[drumbeats]

07:08.128 --> 07:11.329
[singing continues]

07:26.513 --> 07:28.046
[high-pitched singing]

07:28.048 --> 07:29.281
[glass shatters]

07:30.184 --> 07:33.285
[instrumental music]

07:33.287 --> 07:36.021
So we're cool about this
alien thing, right?

07:36.023 --> 07:38.690
By the way, name's ALF.

07:38.692 --> 07:41.526
[sighs]
Hi, ALF.

07:41.528 --> 07:42.727
Name's Pete Finnegan.

07:42.729 --> 07:44.362
[telephone ringing]

07:44.364 --> 07:45.630
Uh, Pete..

07:46.467 --> 07:47.632
What?

07:47.634 --> 07:49.367
Your coat is ringing.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.003
Oh, yeah. Uh..

07:52.005 --> 07:55.407
Willie said I-I could, uh,
borrow the phone.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.276
Uh, hello?

07:58.946 --> 08:00.312
Finnegan, Sgt. Fox.

08:00.314 --> 08:02.447
Did you make contact
with the alien?

08:02.449 --> 08:06.017
Oh. Hi...mom.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.519
Uh, nice of you to call.

08:07.521 --> 08:10.222
Everything is fine here.

08:10.224 --> 08:13.825
(Fox)
'Good. We're mobile.
We'll be there ASAP.'

08:13.827 --> 08:15.727
Well, and a Happy Thanksgiving

08:15.729 --> 08:17.329
to you too, mom.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.765
Can it hear you now?

08:20.767 --> 08:24.703
Yes, my friends are right here.

08:24.705 --> 08:27.339
And they're...terrific.

08:27.341 --> 08:28.607
So friendly.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.578
It may act friendly,
but it could be deadly.

08:33.580 --> 08:35.981
I just hope
we can take it alive.

08:35.983 --> 08:37.449
Oh!

08:37.451 --> 08:40.552
I don't think
it'll be necessary to..

08:40.554 --> 08:43.054
...kill it.

08:43.056 --> 08:46.658
That turkey's been our pet
for years, mom.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.093
That's our call, Mr. Finnegan.

08:48.095 --> 08:50.595
You just keep it occupied
until we get there.

08:50.597 --> 08:51.630
Ahem.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.699
What's his name?

08:54.701 --> 08:55.800
Who?

08:55.802 --> 08:58.069
- Your turkey.
- Sgt. Fox.

08:59.106 --> 09:01.339
Oh, he has a certain..

09:01.341 --> 09:03.275
...military bearing.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.079
[indistinct chattering]

09:09.182 --> 09:11.917
I've been so hungry
I could faint.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.919
Dog biscuit?

09:13.921 --> 09:15.253
They're good.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.226
Strike three.

09:22.829 --> 09:25.230
Nice shot, Jason.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.732
Martin and I believe that it's
important to encourage a child

09:27.734 --> 09:31.069
to develop athletically
as well as intellectually.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.172
Off to a good start.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.676
Excellent squash, incidentally.

09:41.582 --> 09:44.115
[theme music]

09:44.117 --> 09:45.417
(Flakey Pete)
Wow!

09:45.419 --> 09:47.485
The colors are spectacular.

09:47.487 --> 09:49.821
Green sky, orange clouds.

09:49.823 --> 09:52.424
Actually, those colors
should be reversed.

09:52.426 --> 09:55.927
I used one of those cheapo
12-second photo places.

09:57.564 --> 10:00.999
Oh, oh, and this is me and my
buddies in the orbit guard.

10:02.235 --> 10:05.003
The Melmacian orbit guard!

10:05.005 --> 10:07.005
Here's our motto.

10:07.007 --> 10:10.842
"To guard the orbits whether
they need it or not."

10:12.279 --> 10:14.245
- Did they?
- Did they what?

10:14.247 --> 10:16.047
Need guarding.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.983
Well, no, not really.

10:17.985 --> 10:20.185
All we had were minor scuffles.

10:20.187 --> 10:21.987
Name-calling mostly.

10:21.989 --> 10:25.323
Sounds like a...pretty
peaceful place.

10:25.325 --> 10:29.828
It was...until that
pesky nuclear explosion.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.863
Nuclear explosion?

10:31.865 --> 10:33.064
How did that happen?

10:33.066 --> 10:35.033
No one's quite sure.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.434
Hmm.

10:36.436 --> 10:38.903
That's why I left the military.

10:38.905 --> 10:40.672
I just didn't believe
that anything

10:40.674 --> 10:43.408
was worth blowing
up a planet for.

10:44.444 --> 10:46.745
So what did you do
in the military?

10:46.747 --> 10:49.381
Oh, space research, uh, mostly.

10:49.383 --> 10:52.083
Sort of our version
of the orbit guard.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.952
Well, we have a lot in common.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.387
Orbit guards.

10:55.389 --> 10:57.389
Not having a home.

10:57.391 --> 11:00.425
Sweet potato pie.

11:00.427 --> 11:03.228
Are you the one who left
the food out for me?

11:03.230 --> 11:05.530
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

11:05.532 --> 11:08.933
I really appreciate that.
Thank you.

11:08.935 --> 11:11.736
Why did you leave
the milk out in saucers?

11:12.873 --> 11:15.407
Uh...I like cats.

11:16.510 --> 11:17.942
Cats are great.

11:17.944 --> 11:20.345
Over the years,
I've had lots of cats.

11:21.248 --> 11:22.580
Me too.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.984
[telephone ringing]

11:25.986 --> 11:28.319
You ought to get an answering
machine in your pants.

11:28.321 --> 11:29.888
[ringing continues]

11:29.890 --> 11:32.257
[ominous music]

11:32.259 --> 11:34.793
Hello?

11:34.795 --> 11:37.062
(Sgt. Fox)
'Finnegan, we're about
30 minutes away.'

11:37.064 --> 11:38.730
(Flakey Pete)
'Thirty minutes?'

11:38.732 --> 11:40.799
Gee, uh...mom..

11:40.801 --> 11:44.202
...you ought to let that
simmer for at least, uh, 45.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.172
What did you find out?

11:47.174 --> 11:50.008
Is it armed? Is it dangerous?

11:50.010 --> 11:51.943
Weapons, war, fighting

11:51.945 --> 11:53.812
is that all you
ever think about?

11:56.650 --> 11:58.249
Lighten up, mom.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.119
Okay, when we're
ready to move in

12:01.121 --> 12:03.288
we'll call and
let your phone ring once.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.490
You got that? Just one ring.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.861
That'll be your signal
to vacate the premises.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.663
And we'll take it from there.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.302
How's mom?

12:18.305 --> 12:20.472
Getting on my nerves.

12:20.474 --> 12:22.140
(Brian)
'Hey, ALF!'

12:23.910 --> 12:25.777
Have you seen the peanut butter?

12:27.013 --> 12:28.613
ALF, who's that?

12:28.615 --> 12:31.316
Oh, this is my
new friend Pete Finnegan.

12:31.318 --> 12:33.651
Flakey, this is Brian Tanner

12:33.653 --> 12:35.887
'and Jake Ochmonek.'

12:35.889 --> 12:38.089
You call him Flakey?

12:38.091 --> 12:40.425
Let he who is without flakiness

12:40.427 --> 12:42.494
cast the first stone.

12:43.997 --> 12:46.564
Nice to meet you two.

12:46.566 --> 12:49.634
ALF, you're not supposed to
let strangers in the house.

12:49.636 --> 12:53.104
Relax, Brian, the Flakemeister's
not gonna tell anyone

12:53.106 --> 12:57.075
I'm an alien.
He's a friend of Willie's.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.510
Oh, yeah? You know Mr. Tanner?

12:58.512 --> 13:00.245
Oh, yeah, sure. Very well.

13:00.247 --> 13:02.514
Matter of fact,
this is his sweater.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.984
What happened to your
Thanksgiving dinner?

13:05.986 --> 13:07.585
Uncle Rocky's still carvin' it.

13:07.587 --> 13:10.121
Come on, Brian,
let's go spoil our appetites.

13:10.824 --> 13:12.657
Nice to meet you both.

13:12.659 --> 13:15.326
Yeah...likewise.

13:15.328 --> 13:18.062
[instrumental music]

13:18.064 --> 13:20.398
The turkey is delicious, Raquel.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.333
And perfectly sliced.

13:24.871 --> 13:26.604
Turkey is an aphrodisiac.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.546
How is everything over there?

13:34.548 --> 13:37.282
- They're okay, I guess.
- "They?"

13:37.284 --> 13:39.384
ALF and that Flakey Pete guy.

13:39.386 --> 13:41.019
Flakey Pete the bum?

13:41.021 --> 13:42.453
The homeless person?

13:42.455 --> 13:44.422
Yeah, he's over at
your house with ALF.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.491
He said he was
a friend of yours.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.661
We've had a lovely time, Raquel.

13:50.063 --> 13:51.296
Yes.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.765
Absolutely lovely.

13:53.767 --> 13:55.366
Come on, kids.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.206
ALF!

14:01.208 --> 14:02.373
[chuckling]

14:02.375 --> 14:03.908
Oh, hi, Willie.

14:04.911 --> 14:06.344
- Where is he?
- Who?

14:06.346 --> 14:08.446
Your little alien guy?

14:08.448 --> 14:11.282
If anything, anything
has happened to him

14:11.284 --> 14:13.151
you are gonna be..

14:13.153 --> 14:14.986
Hey, Willie.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.654
ALF!

14:16.656 --> 14:18.523
Willie.

14:18.525 --> 14:19.557
ALF!

14:21.528 --> 14:22.493
Willie!

14:22.495 --> 14:24.195
- ALF!
- Willie!

14:24.197 --> 14:25.330
- ALF!
- Willie!

14:25.332 --> 14:27.632
- ALF!
- Willie?

14:27.634 --> 14:29.834
We were worried sick about you.

14:29.836 --> 14:33.571
Really? Were you
throwing up and everything?

14:33.573 --> 14:37.075
Well, no, but we're
very relieved you're alright.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.509
Willie, get your camera.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.879
We wanna preserve
this moment of caring.

14:42.115 --> 14:44.015
Never mind about my camera.

14:44.017 --> 14:48.119
What are you doing in the house
with a stranger?

14:48.121 --> 14:50.321
Chatting...snacking..

14:50.323 --> 14:52.523
...swapping war stories.

14:53.827 --> 14:55.526
ALF, this is dangerous.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.161
How much does he know about you?

14:57.163 --> 14:58.696
Why would you let him in here?

14:58.698 --> 15:01.232
He's your friend!
And any friend of yours--

15:01.234 --> 15:03.368
He's not my friend!

15:04.537 --> 15:06.604
You two have a tiff?

15:06.606 --> 15:08.606
ALF, haven't I told you this?

15:08.608 --> 15:12.744
- Never, never--
- Oh, lighten up, Willie.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.646
It's Fappiano.

15:14.648 --> 15:17.382
Besides, aren't you always
telling me that..

15:17.384 --> 15:18.850
...under the skin..

15:18.852 --> 15:20.852
...or, in my case, fur..

15:20.854 --> 15:24.756
...or, in Pete's case,
a ratty overcoat..

15:24.758 --> 15:27.091
...we're all
pretty much the same?

15:27.093 --> 15:28.293
A little needy.

15:28.295 --> 15:30.028
A little insecure.

15:30.030 --> 15:32.030
But decent and good.

15:38.638 --> 15:39.671
Listen..

15:40.907 --> 15:42.573
...ALF is stranded here.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.943
He doesn't have any
place else to go.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.980
I-I know he looks like an alien
to you, but he..

15:50.116 --> 15:52.517
...he's a member of our family.

15:52.519 --> 15:54.986
We-we've got to protect him.

15:54.988 --> 15:57.388
'We can't let anything
happen to him.'

15:58.992 --> 16:00.725
Do you understand?

16:02.462 --> 16:04.462
Yeah. I do.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.634
Could you stay and..

16:09.636 --> 16:11.502
...have a little supper with us?

16:11.504 --> 16:12.937
It may not be much.

16:12.939 --> 16:15.840
In fact, I can guarantee
it won't be much, but..

16:15.842 --> 16:17.709
...you're welcome.

16:17.711 --> 16:21.079
Well, thank you, but, uh, I
really think I ought to go.

16:21.081 --> 16:24.282
Oh, please, please, please!,
please, pleease!

16:24.284 --> 16:27.352
We've got cold meatloaf
and rubber vomit.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.423
Good news.
There's turkey after all.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.625
Well, uh, turkey franks.

16:35.729 --> 16:37.328
Oh, well, ahem..

16:37.330 --> 16:40.264
...maybe I could stay
for...a minute.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.066
- Please.
- Okay.

16:44.471 --> 16:47.772
Hey, now, Flakeonomy, isn't this
what it's all about?

16:47.774 --> 16:50.375
Good food and good friends.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.910
Well, good friends, anyway.

16:52.912 --> 16:54.645
I'm gonna be in a
Thanksgiving play

16:54.647 --> 16:57.148
at Wallace Park tomorrow.
You can come if you want.

16:57.150 --> 17:00.952
Oh, gee, I think I'll
probably be busy tomorrow.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.455
Wish you could see my play, ALF.

17:04.457 --> 17:06.991
Me too, Brighton Beach.

17:06.993 --> 17:08.960
Uh, oh, wait a minute.

17:08.962 --> 17:11.429
We have a little surprise
for you guys.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.064
Yeah!

17:13.066 --> 17:16.868
Let me guess.
A basket of imported calicoes!

17:18.071 --> 17:20.772
No, it's an empty picnic basket.

17:20.774 --> 17:24.008
An empty picnic basket?
What good is that?

17:24.010 --> 17:26.778
It's especially designed
to enable you to view

17:26.780 --> 17:29.981
Brian's play without being seen.

17:31.117 --> 17:32.784
It was my idea.

17:32.786 --> 17:35.520
Give credit where credit is due.

17:35.522 --> 17:39.524
Aw. You guys are the greatest.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.426
We'll go over your
lines after dinner.

17:41.428 --> 17:44.962
I don't wanna be embarrassed
in front of the other parents.

17:44.964 --> 17:46.264
[telephone rings]

17:46.266 --> 17:47.865
(Lynn)
I'll get it.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.135
Hello?

17:51.137 --> 17:53.004
Hmm, they must have hung up.

17:55.308 --> 17:56.941
Uh, if you'll excuse me

17:56.943 --> 17:59.944
I think I'd better
go wash my hands.

17:59.946 --> 18:02.246
Don't be long, these
turkey franks will be ready

18:02.248 --> 18:04.048
in exactly 40 seconds.

18:07.087 --> 18:09.687
'Alright, let's sing the
Thanksgiving hymn.'

18:09.689 --> 18:11.756
¶ We gather together ¶

18:11.758 --> 18:14.492
¶ To ask the Lord's blessing ¶

18:14.494 --> 18:17.228
¶ He chastens and hastens ¶

18:17.230 --> 18:19.664
¶ His will to make known ¶

18:19.666 --> 18:22.467
¶ The wicked oppressing.. ¶¶

18:24.504 --> 18:27.705
[sentimental music]

18:32.479 --> 18:35.680
[suspenseful music]

18:38.218 --> 18:41.352
Well, ah, ready to go.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.254
What's the setup? Is he inside?

18:43.256 --> 18:45.890
What? Is-is who inside?

18:45.892 --> 18:47.525
The alien.

18:47.527 --> 18:49.460
I'm the alien!

18:51.364 --> 18:54.031
- What?
- Yep, yep, yep.

18:54.033 --> 18:56.100
Yeah, you got me.
I'm from outer space.

18:56.102 --> 18:58.736
[clears throat]
Neesbeck...to be exact.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.671
I wanna thank you guys for
coming on such short notice.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.807
I really appreciate it.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.942
You have a bowl of mercury
I could drink?

19:05.812 --> 19:07.111
I don't believe this.

19:07.113 --> 19:08.846
Another bum looking
for a hot meal.

19:08.848 --> 19:11.015
We missed the end of
the game for this.

19:11.017 --> 19:13.718
Forget it, pal. We've got
your name in our database.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.686
Don't ever call us again. Out!

19:15.688 --> 19:17.955
Roger. Ouch! Ow..

19:19.092 --> 19:21.092
[sentimental music]

19:22.795 --> 19:26.197
Where're you going?
I can prove I'm from Neesbeck.

19:26.199 --> 19:28.566
Our national bird is dust!

19:34.974 --> 19:39.810
¶ We all do extol Thee
Thou leader triumphant ¶

19:39.812 --> 19:43.281
¶ And pray that Thou
still our defender.. ¶

19:43.283 --> 19:44.448
Everything alright?

19:44.450 --> 19:46.217
Everything's great. Thanks.

19:46.219 --> 19:49.787
¶ Congregation escape
tribulation ¶

19:49.789 --> 19:52.456
¶ Thy name be ever praised ¶

19:52.458 --> 19:57.128
¶ O Lord, make us free ¶¶

19:57.130 --> 20:00.131
[gentle music]

20:01.768 --> 20:03.601
We pilgrims are townsfolk.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.269
We know not of the outdoors.

20:05.271 --> 20:07.805
How can we survive
in this wilderness?

20:09.442 --> 20:10.975
Yo, pilgrim.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.412
Oh, he's so cute.

20:14.414 --> 20:16.614
He's ruined my feather duster.

20:16.616 --> 20:18.549
And my best belt.

20:19.285 --> 20:20.851
Who are you?

20:20.853 --> 20:22.853
Squanto the Indian.

20:22.855 --> 20:25.323
The last of the Patuxet.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.158
You speak English?

20:27.160 --> 20:28.693
Many moons ago

20:28.695 --> 20:30.795
I was captured by the white man

20:30.797 --> 20:33.698
and taken across
the great waters

20:33.700 --> 20:35.499
to the old-world.

20:35.501 --> 20:37.535
But I missed my people.

20:37.537 --> 20:39.537
How did you get back here?

20:39.539 --> 20:41.272
I rented a car.

20:43.109 --> 20:44.242
ALF.

20:44.244 --> 20:45.476
I took a cab.

20:45.478 --> 20:48.179
- ALF.
- I don't remember!

20:48.181 --> 20:50.481
What's important
is that I'm here.

20:50.483 --> 20:53.217
We are so different from you.

20:53.219 --> 20:55.052
Ah, do not be embarrassed

20:55.054 --> 20:57.655
because your skin
is a funny color

20:57.657 --> 20:59.957
and you wear stupid clothes.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.693
The great spirit says

21:02.695 --> 21:05.730
that we're all
brothers under the skin.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.932
And come the next full moon

21:07.934 --> 21:12.003
we will celebrate the
bountiful harvest together.

21:12.005 --> 21:15.006
"And so it came to pass,
there was a bountiful harvest

21:15.008 --> 21:16.907
and reason for giving thanks."

21:16.909 --> 21:20.411
And someday there'll be college
football and department stores

21:20.413 --> 21:23.681
and a parade with a giant
inflatable underdog.

21:24.584 --> 21:26.984
ALF, that's not your cue.

21:26.986 --> 21:30.554
"In 1620, a hardy band of
pilgrims came to America

21:30.556 --> 21:34.225
"in search of religious freedom
and boundless opportunity.

21:34.227 --> 21:36.327
"Since then,
millions have come here

21:36.329 --> 21:37.461
"for the same reasons

21:37.463 --> 21:39.964
from all over the world."

21:39.966 --> 21:42.033
And one from Melmac..

21:42.035 --> 21:44.235
...who crashed into a garage.

21:48.708 --> 21:50.241
[instrumental music]

21:52.312 --> 21:55.880
Well, now, if you need anything,
you got my card.

21:55.882 --> 21:57.882
Oh, thanks, but I'll be fine.

21:57.884 --> 21:59.684
Are you sure you can't stay?

21:59.686 --> 22:01.385
Oh, thanks, ALF, but, no.

22:01.387 --> 22:03.654
I usually spend this time
of year in Florida.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.523
Lots of rich widows
with loose change

22:05.525 --> 22:07.191
and full of the holiday spirit.

22:07.193 --> 22:08.592
[chuckles]

22:08.594 --> 22:10.628
- Goodbye, Pete.
- Bye, Willie.

22:10.630 --> 22:11.696
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

22:11.698 --> 22:13.230
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

22:14.567 --> 22:15.766
Bye, cornflake.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.568
Bye, ALF.

22:17.570 --> 22:19.036
And thanks.

22:22.275 --> 22:25.309
- Gee, I hope he keeps in touch.
- Hmm.

22:25.311 --> 22:28.045
I'm sure he will.
He took our phone.

22:30.249 --> 22:32.783
