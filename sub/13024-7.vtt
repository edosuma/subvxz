01:06.600 --> 01:08.560
<i>We'll be arriving
at the Balmera soon.</i>

01:08.643 --> 01:11.980
<i>Liberating these Balmerans
from Zarkon's grasp will not be easy.</i>

01:13.356 --> 01:14.607
So, what's the plan?

01:14.608 --> 01:17.110
We go in there and just...
pow, pow, pow!

01:17.193 --> 01:19.779
- And free the prisoners?
- What was that noise?

01:19.863 --> 01:20.989
Laser guns.

01:21.072 --> 01:22.844
No, Lance, I think you mean...

01:26.745 --> 01:29.581
- Pow!
- That sounds like fireworks.

01:29.664 --> 01:33.418
Technically, they're more like...
ba-choo, ba-choo, ba-choo!

01:33.501 --> 01:36.713
Okay, enough with the bad sound effects.

01:36.796 --> 01:39.382
Besides, it's more like...
blam, blam, blam!

01:39.466 --> 01:40.717
- What?
- You're crazy.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.135
- No way.
- Wrong.

01:42.218 --> 01:43.762
Paladins, focus.

01:43.845 --> 01:46.197
Besides, we can't just
shoot at the Galra.

01:46.198 --> 01:47.766
This Balmera, it's, like, alive.

01:47.849 --> 01:50.268
And from what we've seen,
it doesn't look very good.

01:50.352 --> 01:54.272
Yes, it's an atrocity what the Galra
have been doing to this grand beast.

01:54.356 --> 01:56.650
Stealing its crystals,
its very life force,

01:56.733 --> 02:00.028
without ever performing the energy
rejuvenation ceremonies to heal it.

02:00.111 --> 02:02.405
After seeing Shay's people enslaved,

02:02.489 --> 02:05.408
it made me realize
how bad Zarkon really is.

02:05.492 --> 02:07.661
And we're the only ones
who can stop him.

02:07.744 --> 02:10.163
Okay, so we can't go into the tunnels
guns blazing.

02:10.246 --> 02:13.625
Plan B. We figure out how to draw
the Galra up to the surface

02:13.708 --> 02:14.918
and battle them out there.

02:15.001 --> 02:18.380
I know. If we attack all of this
big mining stuff on the surface,

02:18.463 --> 02:21.132
the Galra troops
will have to come out to defend it.

02:21.216 --> 02:24.594
Then we beat them up, head down
to the tunnels, Voltron saves the day.

02:24.678 --> 02:27.514
How will we know
how many are left in the tunnels?

02:27.597 --> 02:29.516
We can track the Galra
and the Balmerans

02:29.599 --> 02:32.268
using Biothermal Life Indicator
Point Technology.

02:32.352 --> 02:34.104
Oh, BLIP tech!

02:36.231 --> 02:38.149
- It's an acronym.
- One of you will need

02:38.233 --> 02:41.611
to fly around the Balmera and drop sensors
into the shafts on each side.

02:41.695 --> 02:44.823
Then we'll be able to see
where the Galra and the Balmerans are.

02:44.906 --> 02:46.825
There are already sensors
built into your suits.

02:46.908 --> 02:49.327
I can do it.
I just modified the Green Lion

02:49.411 --> 02:51.246
with the invisible maze's
cloaking ability.

02:51.329 --> 02:53.581
I should be able to fly around unnoticed.

02:53.665 --> 02:55.208
That's their main power generator.

02:55.291 --> 02:58.336
If you take that down,
it will severely weaken their defenses.

02:58.420 --> 03:01.256
We'll stay in cloud cover
and give tactical support.

03:01.339 --> 03:03.925
With the Castle's defenses
weakened from Sendak's crystal,

03:04.008 --> 03:05.927
we won't be of much help to you.

03:06.010 --> 03:08.555
I'll take out the power generator.
Keith, Lance, Hunk,

03:08.638 --> 03:11.057
you take out these big mining rigs
around the area.

03:11.141 --> 03:14.310
Yeah! Okay, let's do this!
Let's go kick some alien butt!

03:29.742 --> 03:31.869
You think the Balmerans
will have a parade for us

03:31.870 --> 03:33.288
after we've freed everybody?

03:33.371 --> 03:37.625
<i>It's not about the glory, Lance.
It's about freeing prisoners from Zarkon.</i>

03:37.709 --> 03:41.337
No, I know. I know. But still.
When they...

03:57.896 --> 04:00.607
This is it. Get your heads
in the game. Remember,

04:00.690 --> 04:02.525
the Balmera is a living creature.

04:02.609 --> 04:06.654
Make sure you pinpoint only the Galra
installations and not its surface.

04:08.990 --> 04:10.492
<i>Initiating cloak.</i>

04:29.969 --> 04:31.846
How do I take this thing down?

04:33.139 --> 04:34.808
What's that?

04:34.891 --> 04:38.019
Jaw blade? Okay! Let's do this!

04:59.332 --> 05:01.000
<i>All sensors delivered.</i>

05:12.178 --> 05:15.181
Whoa! Did you guys just see that?
I got fire power!

05:15.265 --> 05:16.933
Hey! I want that!

05:17.684 --> 05:18.852
<i>Oh, no!</i>

05:21.312 --> 05:23.773
<i>Hey, we can't let this thing
hurt the Balmera.</i>

05:31.531 --> 05:34.158
<i>I think my
lion knows what to do!</i>

05:44.627 --> 05:48.423
Aw, snap!
These rays are super cool, just like me!

05:49.132 --> 05:50.967
<i>Great job, team!</i>

05:55.305 --> 05:58.349
Where are all the troops?
They're not coming to the surface.

05:58.433 --> 06:01.769
<i>Yeah, I remember seeing
a lot of Galra guys down in the mines.</i>

06:01.853 --> 06:05.273
We've located a hangar full
of Galra fighters just below the surface.

06:05.356 --> 06:07.775
Someone has to take those out
before they can launch.

06:07.859 --> 06:10.069
They're luring us down,
but we have no choice.

06:10.153 --> 06:11.946
Keith, Lance, you guys hit the hangar.

06:12.030 --> 06:14.991
Hunk, head to the prison to rescue
Shay and the other Balmerans.

06:15.074 --> 06:17.243
Pidge and I will track down
the Galra soldiers.

06:17.327 --> 06:18.536
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Ten-four.</i>

06:18.620 --> 06:20.330
<i>- On it.
- Let's do this!</i>

06:25.710 --> 06:29.839
Commander Prorok, we have word
from the troops on Balmera X-95 Vox.

06:29.922 --> 06:33.509
The informants were right.
Voltron is there.

06:33.593 --> 06:37.221
Excellent. Everything is going
according to plan.

06:37.305 --> 06:41.017
How do you wish to proceed?
Should we inform Emperor Zarkon?

06:41.100 --> 06:45.396
Contact Subcommander Ylvik.
His fleet is awaiting my command.

06:45.480 --> 06:50.610
Tell him it's time to attack.
I will update the Emperor.

07:21.557 --> 07:24.769
The entire hangar's
only being guarded by a few sentries.

07:26.062 --> 07:28.898
- Let's go!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Cool your jets, Keith!

07:28.982 --> 07:31.526
Don't you remember that
stuff about this Balmera

07:31.527 --> 07:34.070
- thing being a sensitive animal?
- Oh, right.

07:34.153 --> 07:37.031
Yeah, so we can't just blow things up
like a psycho.

07:37.115 --> 07:38.491
You got a better idea?

07:38.574 --> 07:42.453
I do. We sneak into the control room
to shut down the bay doors.

07:42.537 --> 07:44.580
- That'll trap the ships in.
- That...

07:45.289 --> 07:47.834
actually is a better idea.

07:59.095 --> 08:02.557
Allura, Coran, what's my location?
All these tunnels look the same.

08:02.640 --> 08:04.517
I can't remember where the prison is.

08:04.600 --> 08:08.146
You're on the right path.
Turn right at the next tunnel.

08:08.688 --> 08:11.357
Once you get there,
you'll have to disable the energy doors.

08:11.441 --> 08:13.401
Be careful.
It looks like it's heavily guarded.

08:14.569 --> 08:16.738
No, no. It's over here.

08:16.821 --> 08:18.781
I know what I'm doing.

08:22.660 --> 08:25.538
Keep an eye out for those guards.

08:25.621 --> 08:28.750
I'll see if I can find a way
to shut the hangar doors.

08:34.505 --> 08:39.092
Uh... Hmm.
Nope. Maybe. Uh...

08:39.177 --> 08:40.803
Uh... Mm...

08:44.182 --> 08:46.350
I don't know what I'm doing here.

08:46.434 --> 08:48.352
It's all Galra gibberish.

08:48.436 --> 08:49.562
Let me see.

09:05.411 --> 09:07.163
Whoa! How'd you do that?

09:07.246 --> 09:09.916
I just put my hand on the handprint.

09:33.231 --> 09:35.108
Yeah!

09:36.025 --> 09:38.111
That was way too easy.

09:38.194 --> 09:41.781
I definitely don't have
a good feeling about this.

09:58.589 --> 10:01.259
Hunk, you have returned.

10:01.342 --> 10:05.346
I promised I'd be back.
We're here to help. Where's Shay?

10:05.429 --> 10:08.808
Our life may not have been perfect,
but our family was whole.

10:08.891 --> 10:12.395
Your arrival has left us
imprisoned and torn apart.

10:12.478 --> 10:13.938
As soon as your attack started,

10:14.021 --> 10:16.440
they took her away
to the core of the Balmera.

10:16.524 --> 10:19.152
For all we know,
she could be gone for good.

10:20.111 --> 10:24.532
Paladins, are you there? The Galra troops
are moving down the tunnels.

10:24.615 --> 10:26.784
It looks like they're going down
toward the center.

10:26.868 --> 10:28.578
They must be headed to the core.

10:28.579 --> 10:30.288
That's where they're holding Shay.

10:30.371 --> 10:32.373
<i>They're drawing
us into an ambush,</i>

10:32.456 --> 10:35.168
<i>but we don't have a choice
if we want to save Shay.</i>

10:35.251 --> 10:37.879
We have to follow.
Lance, Keith, get to the core.

10:37.962 --> 10:40.610
I think we're going to need
everyone together to get

10:40.611 --> 10:43.259
- through this firefight.
- Copy that. We're on our way.

10:57.732 --> 11:01.110
<i>You're in an area where the
tunnels are too narrow for your speeder.</i>

11:01.194 --> 11:02.862
Yeah. Proceeding on foot.

11:04.739 --> 11:06.782
There's someone here.

11:06.866 --> 11:08.326
<i>Looking into it.</i>

11:12.580 --> 11:15.207
<i>Pidge, no! Those are Balmerans!</i>

11:17.001 --> 11:18.294
Phew!

11:34.435 --> 11:35.853
Don't worry.

11:35.937 --> 11:39.732
<i>Hey, team, be careful.
The Balmera is very unstable.</i>

11:43.569 --> 11:47.114
Their shooting is destroying the Balmera.
We gotta do something.

11:51.702 --> 11:55.748
Well, we can't shoot back.
It'll just make it worse.

12:03.673 --> 12:04.882
Hmm...

12:10.846 --> 12:12.348
Huh?

12:46.590 --> 12:48.843
Shay! You're alive!

12:58.019 --> 12:59.450
Where are the Galra?

12:59.451 --> 13:02.314
If this is an ambush, they
should be here waiting for us.

13:06.485 --> 13:08.988
Not an ambush.
More like a trap.

13:09.071 --> 13:10.990
Whatever it is, keep your guard up.

13:11.073 --> 13:14.744
The Galra, they gained knowledge
that you would return to the Balmera.

13:14.827 --> 13:16.704
- How?
- I know not.

13:16.787 --> 13:20.624
But they set this trap just for you.
I was the bait.

13:20.708 --> 13:24.003
Who could have possibly known
that we were heading here to save Shay?

13:24.086 --> 13:27.048
Rolo! Those liars must have told Zarkon.

13:27.131 --> 13:29.800
We have to figure out
how to get out of here.

13:29.884 --> 13:32.553
Wait! We have a giant Castle ship
hovering in the sky.

13:32.636 --> 13:36.474
- Allura, can you please come get us?
- How do you expect her to do that, genius?

13:36.557 --> 13:38.726
I don't know, maybe they got
teleporters or something.

13:38.809 --> 13:41.020
We're quite occupied at the moment.

13:43.189 --> 13:45.983
<i>We're completely surrounded by
Galra ships and we're taking heavy fire!</i>

13:56.911 --> 13:59.705
Princess, our particle barrier
won't last much longer!

13:59.789 --> 14:03.125
Paladins, you need to get out of there
as soon as you can!

14:03.209 --> 14:07.546
This is it! We're going to die in here.
I can say bye-bye to that parade.

14:08.798 --> 14:12.468
Get it together, guys.
Allura, we'll get there as soon as we can.

14:12.551 --> 14:15.221
Perhaps my people can help us get out.

14:15.846 --> 14:18.099
This is how we communicate.

14:18.182 --> 14:20.184
The Balmera senses our vibrations

14:20.267 --> 14:22.436
and sends a message
to those in the tunnels.

14:22.520 --> 14:26.315
Are you sure someone
will be able to hear your... hand

14:26.399 --> 14:27.942
from all the way down here?

14:28.025 --> 14:30.569
The Balmera will deliver the message.

14:59.807 --> 15:01.851
It's a message from Shay.

15:01.934 --> 15:03.769
She's alive!

15:03.853 --> 15:08.566
The Paladins of Voltron went to the core
of the Balmera to save Shay...

15:08.649 --> 15:10.359
and now they are all trapped.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.736
Then we are all doomed.

15:14.113 --> 15:17.324
This is all my fault.
I conspired against them,

15:17.408 --> 15:20.202
and, because of my actions,
Shay was imprisoned.

15:20.286 --> 15:22.079
The big yellow one was right.

15:22.163 --> 15:25.040
If we ever hope to be free,
we must take action.

15:26.167 --> 15:29.795
But how can we rise up
against our Galra overlords?

15:29.879 --> 15:31.839
What choice do we have?

15:31.922 --> 15:34.508
They have stolen all of the crystals
from our Balmera.

15:34.592 --> 15:36.886
Our lives are worthless to them now.

15:37.970 --> 15:40.139
But Balmerans have never fought.

15:40.931 --> 15:44.935
You taught me that without family,
we have nothing.

15:45.019 --> 15:47.062
The Galra have taken Shay.

15:47.146 --> 15:51.358
How can we do nothing while the paladins
sacrifice everything to save us?

15:51.442 --> 15:53.068
We must do our part!

15:59.408 --> 16:02.119
Lord Zarkon, I have news to report.

16:02.203 --> 16:05.206
News that will likely please you,
my Emperor.

16:05.289 --> 16:07.166
Proceed.

16:07.249 --> 16:12.630
I have the Voltron Paladins trapped on
a Balmera in the Javeeno star system.

16:12.713 --> 16:17.426
I've ordered a fleet to capture the lions
and destroy the Altean Castle.

16:17.510 --> 16:22.264
You fool! You dare make plans
without informing me?

16:22.348 --> 16:26.644
Forgive me, Emperor,
but I saw an opportunity and I took it

16:26.727 --> 16:28.687
for the glory of the Galra Empire.

16:28.771 --> 16:32.775
I suspect that you are seeking
your own glory, Prorok.

16:32.858 --> 16:36.362
But you do not realize Voltron's power.

16:42.952 --> 16:44.974
They're heading down into the tunnels!

16:44.975 --> 16:46.997
They're going to steal the lions!

16:51.168 --> 16:53.337
Paladins, the lions are in danger!

16:53.338 --> 16:55.506
You must get back to them immediately!

16:55.589 --> 16:58.884
Princess, something's locked onto us.

17:12.856 --> 17:16.859
<i>Paladins, do you copy?
There's a battle cruiser locked onto us.</i>

17:16.944 --> 17:20.781
<i>If it fires with its ion cannon,
I don't know if we can survive.</i>

17:20.864 --> 17:22.241
We're trying, Allura.

17:22.324 --> 17:25.536
Shay's pressing her hand against a wall,
which apparently sends vibrations

17:25.618 --> 17:28.289
to the other rock people,
who vibrate back or something?

17:28.372 --> 17:32.084
Hand talking? I guess the answer
to your question is, "Yes, we copy."

17:32.167 --> 17:35.421
Shay, are you sure the Balmera
is sending your message?

17:53.480 --> 17:54.648
Rax!

17:54.732 --> 17:57.568
We must make haste.
We know a shortcut through the tunnels.

17:57.651 --> 18:00.446
Allura, stand by. We're on our way up.

18:04.033 --> 18:06.410
<i>Paladins, hurry!
They're taking off with the lions!</i>

18:20.049 --> 18:22.760
Guys, did everyone make it
to the lions in time?

18:24.136 --> 18:25.471
<i>Come on, Shiro.</i>

18:25.554 --> 18:28.474
<i>Who you think you're dealing with,
a bunch of amateurs?</i>

18:29.391 --> 18:31.852
<i>- Do you really want me to answer that?
- No.</i>

18:31.935 --> 18:33.145
<i>Let's go!</i>

19:09.932 --> 19:11.183
<i>Hunk, watch out!</i>

19:12.267 --> 19:13.644
<i>Got you covered!</i>

19:14.687 --> 19:16.480
Phew!
Thanks, guys!

19:19.608 --> 19:21.860
<i>It's charging its ion cannon!</i>

19:21.944 --> 19:23.987
Divert all shields to the bow.

19:40.629 --> 19:44.883
Paladins, I need you immediately!
Five more ticks and we're finished!

19:44.967 --> 19:47.845
Okay, team, let's form Voltron!

19:48.721 --> 19:49.555
Yeah!

21:10.761 --> 21:12.763
Right now is our chance, Princess!

21:12.846 --> 21:17.976
Full power on the blasters!
Locked onto target. Fire!

21:49.258 --> 21:51.718
<i>- Yeah!
- Nice shot, Princess!</i>

21:51.802 --> 21:54.513
<i>Yeah!
The parade's back on!</i>

21:56.390 --> 22:00.185
<i>The Galra fleet and all sentries
on the Balmera have been defeated.</i>

22:01.520 --> 22:03.438
No! How could this be?

22:03.522 --> 22:08.944
Lord Zarkon, I will do all that I can
to recapture Voltron for the Galra.

22:09.027 --> 22:14.867
Silence, Prorok. I have plans
that you cannot comprehend.

22:18.662 --> 22:20.455
<i>Mission accomplished.</i>

22:20.539 --> 22:22.374
And just in the tick of time.

22:22.457 --> 22:25.711
The Castle's defenses are battered
and will need to fully recharge.

22:25.794 --> 22:28.171
Huh?

22:28.255 --> 22:32.467
There's an unknown object incoming!
It's about to crash into the Balmera!

22:41.518 --> 22:42.978
<i>What the heck is that?</i>

22:44.438 --> 22:45.647
<i>Trouble.</i>
