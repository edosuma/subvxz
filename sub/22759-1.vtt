01:16.825 --> 01:19.574
- I'm telling you
Dallas looks nervous.

01:19.575 --> 01:22.950
- Your brother's gonna be fine.

01:26.991 --> 01:29.907
- Are you sure you
got that combination?

01:29.908 --> 01:31.658
- Compliments of Ms. Parker.

01:31.659 --> 01:32.534
- I hope she's right.

01:32.535 --> 01:33.949
- She always is.

01:33.950 --> 01:35.449
- Not about the
combination or the clock.

01:35.450 --> 01:37.740
- What did I just say?

01:37.741 --> 01:39.366
If you can't do this,
you should've told me.

01:39.367 --> 01:40.491
- If that clock
ain't have zeros,

01:40.492 --> 01:43.324
I won't have a chance.

01:43.325 --> 01:44.449
- Almost done.

01:51.492 --> 01:54.409
They're watching reruns.

02:01.409 --> 02:03.242
- All right.

02:03.866 --> 02:05.491
What's the combination?

02:05.492 --> 02:06.492
- 25,

02:07.534 --> 02:08.533
34,

02:09.408 --> 02:10.990
18,

02:10.991 --> 02:11.991
six.

02:33.325 --> 02:34.950
Go.

02:41.367 --> 02:42.991
6949.

02:53.450 --> 02:54.450
7022.

03:27.325 --> 03:28.491
You ready for the beach, Jonesy?

03:28.492 --> 03:30.740
- Fuck yeah.

04:09.741 --> 04:12.700
- Yeah, let's go.

05:51.117 --> 05:52.117
- Glad you came.

05:52.118 --> 05:55.200
It only took us 18
years to get here.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.991
- We still got
3,000 miles to go.

06:04.033 --> 06:05.990
- What the hell is his problem?

06:05.991 --> 06:08.533
- He's not used to winning.

06:08.534 --> 06:11.033
- You heard the man let's go.

06:12.033 --> 06:15.409
- Shit ain't gonna walk
on its own let's go.

09:34.534 --> 09:36.782
- Hey, where's our pilot?

09:36.783 --> 09:37.783
What is it?

09:39.991 --> 09:41.157
- We got a problem.

09:41.158 --> 09:43.782
- What happened?

09:43.783 --> 09:44.783
- It's Bartlett.

09:44.783 --> 09:45.741
- What's going on?

09:45.741 --> 09:46.367
- Where the fuck is it?

09:46.368 --> 09:49.075
- Where is he?

09:49.908 --> 09:50.908
- In there.

09:53.450 --> 09:55.740
- The people we're stealing
from are bloodhounds.

09:55.741 --> 09:57.616
If you fuck up
they will smell it.

09:57.617 --> 10:00.990
They will follow the trail
until they find you and then me,

10:00.991 --> 10:03.366
and then they'll burn
everything we've ever touched.

10:03.367 --> 10:06.949
You need to be smart
about this one, Harrison.

10:06.950 --> 10:08.658
- Is it worth the risk?

10:08.659 --> 10:10.533
- You have no idea.

10:10.534 --> 10:12.616
Frisco City, Indiana
it's somewhere between

10:12.617 --> 10:14.699
Chicago and Indianapolis
middle of nowhere.

10:14.700 --> 10:17.574
It's far enough off the
freeway that no one stops by.

10:17.575 --> 10:20.907
The only thing not slowly
sinking into the soil

10:20.908 --> 10:23.449
is a private bank,

10:23.450 --> 10:26.324
which is why the
cartel loves it.

10:26.325 --> 10:29.074
Chicago's a huge market
supplied by Miami.

10:29.075 --> 10:30.449
So their drug traffic
comes up the interstate,

10:30.450 --> 10:33.491
and then somewhere
around Frisco City

10:33.492 --> 10:35.990
the shipments are
exchanged for cash.

10:35.991 --> 10:37.032
The drugs head north,

10:37.033 --> 10:38.324
and the cash stays right here

10:38.325 --> 10:40.324
in safety deposit boxes.

10:40.325 --> 10:41.824
The cartel isn't taking chances

10:41.825 --> 10:44.408
when it comes to their
drives getting any ideas.

10:44.409 --> 10:47.616
So it just sits there until
Miami decides to pick it up.

10:47.617 --> 10:49.907
You get in and get out
clean without a trace

10:49.908 --> 10:51.324
by the time the cartel finds out

10:51.325 --> 10:53.242
you will be long gone.

10:54.325 --> 10:55.574
- Your source?

10:55.575 --> 10:56.575
- Solid.

10:57.367 --> 10:58.990
This is the middle
of America, Harrison.

10:58.991 --> 11:02.449
They throw their veterans a
Christmas parade every year.

11:02.450 --> 11:03.658
You're gonna wear fatigues

11:03.659 --> 11:06.908
and carry the takeout
in Army duffel bags.

11:09.450 --> 11:11.991
I hear Mack finished his time.

11:12.908 --> 11:15.491
- I didn't know you
were keeping tabs.

11:15.492 --> 11:17.908
- I'll tell you what I think.

11:18.908 --> 11:19.783
You feel like you owe him,

11:19.784 --> 11:21.907
and you're planning
on using him.

11:21.908 --> 11:22.866
- I don't think it's
any of your business.

11:22.867 --> 11:25.074
- It is, Harrison,
because if you fuck up

11:25.075 --> 11:26.782
who do you think
it comes down on?

11:26.783 --> 11:28.032
- You run shit
from behind a desk.

11:28.033 --> 11:31.699
You don't know what it's like
when the clock is ticking.

11:31.700 --> 11:33.616
Let me give you a number.

11:33.617 --> 11:35.074
18.

11:35.075 --> 11:36.950
18 jobs, no fuck ups.

11:38.200 --> 11:40.616
That's why you're
here because what I do

11:40.617 --> 11:42.032
pays your bills,

11:42.033 --> 11:45.865
and the only reason that
happens is 'cause of my men.

11:45.866 --> 11:47.032
'Cause when the clock is ticking

11:47.033 --> 11:48.366
and the heat is
breathing down my neck

11:48.367 --> 11:50.074
and I hear those sirens,

11:50.075 --> 11:51.616
I know the three guys
in the ship with me

11:51.617 --> 11:55.199
ain't gonna run not
until I tell them to.

11:55.200 --> 11:58.367
And this ain't
happening without them.

12:01.908 --> 12:02.908
- 17.

12:04.575 --> 12:05.492
- Excuse me.

12:05.493 --> 12:06.659
- 17 out of 18.

12:09.325 --> 12:10.075
- Well, since Mack took the fall

12:10.076 --> 12:12.282
and you got your take

12:12.283 --> 12:14.408
I consider that a win.

12:14.409 --> 12:18.699
- Don't get me
wrong I'm grateful.

12:18.700 --> 12:22.907
I could've silenced Mack if
I wanted to but I didn't.

12:22.908 --> 12:25.158
- This conversation's over.

12:26.450 --> 12:27.450
- Harrison,

12:29.367 --> 12:32.241
no matter who you are doing
that much time leaves a mark

12:32.242 --> 12:36.366
especially if you're doing
that time for somebody else.

12:36.367 --> 12:37.949
Mack's changed.

12:37.950 --> 12:38.950
He found God and now he spends

12:38.951 --> 12:41.658
all of his time on his
knees repenting his sins.

12:41.659 --> 12:45.116
- Well, then he can use
his share to buy a church.

12:45.117 --> 12:46.991
I trust him.

12:47.991 --> 12:48.991
- I know.

12:54.450 --> 12:55.283
- Ah, Jesus.
- No.

12:55.284 --> 12:58.366
- Oh, god.
- What happened?

12:58.367 --> 12:59.699
- I found him in here with this.

12:59.700 --> 13:02.366
- A bullet that shit
doesn't make any sense.

13:02.367 --> 13:03.242
- It's a message.

13:03.242 --> 13:03.950
- Okay, what does it mean?

13:03.951 --> 13:05.408
- It means we're being hunted.

13:05.409 --> 13:06.782
- Somebody's toying with us.

13:06.783 --> 13:08.116
- Someone wants the money.

13:08.117 --> 13:09.241
- Well, how do you know?

13:09.242 --> 13:10.949
- What the fuck
are we doing here, Dallas?

13:10.950 --> 13:11.659
- Harrison said this
shit was airtight.

13:11.660 --> 13:12.699
It's gotta be something else.

13:12.700 --> 13:14.740
I mean we don't even
fucking know this guy.

13:14.741 --> 13:15.741
- I did.

13:16.367 --> 13:17.782
- Did he know about the job?

13:17.783 --> 13:18.990
- He knew where we were going

13:18.991 --> 13:20.616
and how much he'd get
for taking us there.

13:20.617 --> 13:21.824
Somebody else found out.

13:21.825 --> 13:22.825
- Ah, this is fucked.

13:25.659 --> 13:26.492
- Alright, here's what we do.

13:26.493 --> 13:27.658
Alright, we split up.

13:27.659 --> 13:28.325
D and I we head back
into town we grab a car.

13:28.326 --> 13:30.199
We double back here.

13:30.200 --> 13:30.783
We take our chances on the road.

13:30.784 --> 13:31.990
- No, wait a minute.

13:31.991 --> 13:33.199
- What?
- Wait a minute.

13:33.200 --> 13:34.491
- Look if we're gonna
move, we gotta move now.

13:34.492 --> 13:36.449
- We need to fucking
think this through, man.

13:36.450 --> 13:37.824
They fucking made him bleed.

13:37.825 --> 13:38.783
They pulled him in here,

13:38.784 --> 13:40.533
and they put him on display.

13:40.534 --> 13:41.325
I mean look at that shit.

13:41.326 --> 13:43.658
Look at the plastic bag.

13:43.659 --> 13:44.949
Alright, he wasn't fucking dead

13:44.950 --> 13:45.990
when they taped
him to the chair.

13:45.991 --> 13:46.783
So they put that
around his head,

13:46.784 --> 13:48.865
so he'd suffocate
when he came to.

13:48.866 --> 13:52.116
Okay, that's some
savage shit, boys.

13:52.117 --> 13:53.990
Whoever did this
knew we were coming.

13:53.991 --> 13:54.950
Alright they knew
we'd find Bartlett,

13:54.951 --> 13:56.949
and they know we're
here right now.

13:56.950 --> 13:58.199
- Oh, you don't
think the cartel?

13:58.200 --> 13:59.616
- Nah, not the cartel.

13:59.617 --> 14:00.990
They would've mowed us down
the minute we got here.

14:00.991 --> 14:01.741
- Unless they're
fucking with us, bro.

14:01.742 --> 14:02.824
- That's what I'm saying.

14:02.825 --> 14:04.533
We need to take a second
and think this through.

14:04.534 --> 14:06.740
- Bartlett didn't deserve this,

14:06.741 --> 14:08.865
and we ain't splitting up.

14:08.866 --> 14:11.990
We're gonna figure
out whoever did this,

14:11.991 --> 14:13.991
and we're gonna kill him.

14:15.866 --> 14:16.907
- Fuck.

14:47.409 --> 14:50.242
- Dallas told me
I'd find you here.

14:50.908 --> 14:53.325
- It's good to see you.

14:54.700 --> 14:55.700
- Likewise.

14:56.825 --> 14:58.241
Thought you would've come by.

14:58.242 --> 15:00.116
- I had some things
to take care of first.

15:00.117 --> 15:01.325
- I understand.

15:03.409 --> 15:04.740
Kept this for you.

15:04.741 --> 15:07.075
Your take plus half of mine.

15:08.409 --> 15:09.990
- You wanna do this here.

15:09.991 --> 15:12.032
- I don't see the padre.

15:12.033 --> 15:13.241
Speaking of which when
did all this happen.

15:13.242 --> 15:15.282
- It's a long story.

15:15.283 --> 15:16.117
- I got time.

15:16.118 --> 15:19.449
- A lot can change
in five years.

15:19.450 --> 15:22.574
- I would've come
by but you know.

15:22.575 --> 15:23.824
- I know the rules.

15:23.825 --> 15:25.616
- The rules.
- Right.

15:25.617 --> 15:27.074
- I did what I could.

15:27.075 --> 15:28.449
I looked out for your bro
while you were in the joint.

15:28.450 --> 15:29.450
So keep it.

15:32.283 --> 15:33.740
You can give it to God

15:33.741 --> 15:37.492
or whoever you lit that
candle for it's yours.

15:38.492 --> 15:39.492
Never asked you
to take the fall.

15:39.493 --> 15:40.865
- I never said you did.

15:40.866 --> 15:42.242
- I know, I know.

15:44.158 --> 15:46.241
It's too quiet in here.

15:46.242 --> 15:48.116
It feels like guilt.

15:48.117 --> 15:49.117
- It should.

15:51.659 --> 15:55.449
- Come on let's get a
burger or something.

15:55.450 --> 15:57.991
Mack, I wanna make this right.

16:01.825 --> 16:04.908
- So you're buying
me a slice of pie.

16:05.991 --> 16:08.990
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Anytime.

16:08.991 --> 16:09.991
- Anytime.

16:12.575 --> 16:15.865
Now, Mack, I get it I get it.

16:15.866 --> 16:17.324
Nothing's worth the risk

16:17.325 --> 16:20.575
not when you just
get out of the joint.

16:21.991 --> 16:24.616
I wanna let this one go too.

16:24.617 --> 16:28.491
Waited as long as I
could but the job...

16:28.492 --> 16:29.824
- I'm not interested.

16:29.825 --> 16:30.907
- 'Cause you found God?

16:30.908 --> 16:32.824
- Not your business.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.199
- This will change things for us

16:34.200 --> 16:36.408
for your bro.

16:36.409 --> 16:37.949
- My brother.

16:37.950 --> 16:39.157
- Well, you said it yourself.

16:39.158 --> 16:41.825
A lot of things changed
while you were inside.

16:43.866 --> 16:47.449
- What does he have
to do with this?

16:47.450 --> 16:49.199
- You know Dallas.

16:49.200 --> 16:50.449
He won't take a hand out.

16:50.450 --> 16:51.949
He needs to earn his dough.

16:51.950 --> 16:53.491
- This is how you take
care of my family?

16:53.492 --> 16:54.409
- You need to relax.

16:54.410 --> 16:55.491
- No, he had a shot
at something else.

16:55.492 --> 16:57.658
- He didn't tell you.

16:57.659 --> 16:59.658
- He knows I would've
ripped his head off.

16:59.659 --> 17:02.075
- Mack, you need to sit down.

17:14.325 --> 17:16.156
I thought you knew.

17:16.157 --> 17:17.157
- Know what?

17:18.617 --> 17:22.740
- It was to qualify to fight.

17:22.741 --> 17:26.575
Dallas he was fighting
this big Greek bastard.

17:28.075 --> 17:29.949
The Greek had Dallas
up against the ropes,

17:29.950 --> 17:31.824
was pounding him on
the side of the head

17:31.825 --> 17:34.074
but he got sloppy.

17:34.075 --> 17:35.949
Let it slip for a second.

17:35.950 --> 17:37.533
Dallas swung.

17:37.534 --> 17:38.325
Connected.

17:38.326 --> 17:41.116
We heard a crack.

17:41.117 --> 17:45.740
We thought Dallas had broken
the Greek bastard's jaw.

17:45.741 --> 17:47.658
Turns out it was the
other way around.

17:47.659 --> 17:49.574
Dallas was tough.

17:49.575 --> 17:51.699
He wouldn't go down.

17:51.700 --> 17:54.074
Fought the rest of the fight
with a broken right hand.

17:54.075 --> 17:55.824
He fought Southpaw.

17:55.825 --> 17:57.242
Won in 12 rounds.

18:01.409 --> 18:02.409
- How bad is it?

18:03.908 --> 18:07.783
- They say surgery but
he'll never fight again.

18:18.117 --> 18:19.533
- So he crewed up with you?

18:19.534 --> 18:21.366
How many jobs.

18:21.367 --> 18:22.449
- Three.

18:22.450 --> 18:22.950
This is the last one.

18:22.951 --> 18:24.449
- The last one?

18:24.450 --> 18:25.865
- This one's different.

18:25.866 --> 18:26.907
- You're stealing
something that ain't yours.

18:26.908 --> 18:29.907
Taking something it's
the same damn thing.

18:29.908 --> 18:33.740
- There's no safe just
safety deposit boxes.

18:33.741 --> 18:36.075
We're talking eight figures.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.366
- That's a lot of heat.

18:38.367 --> 18:39.367
- Not from the cops.

18:46.617 --> 18:48.409
- The money's dirty.

18:49.700 --> 18:51.241
And Dallas.

18:51.242 --> 18:52.200
- Just the driver.

18:52.201 --> 18:53.617
He waits outside.

18:56.825 --> 18:57.825
- I don't like it.

18:57.826 --> 18:58.991
- You never do.

18:59.575 --> 19:01.783
- Tell you what

19:03.908 --> 19:05.117
you want me in?

19:06.075 --> 19:07.783
You cut Dallas lose.

19:12.659 --> 19:14.533
- I'll tell you what

19:14.534 --> 19:15.616
you talk him out of it.

19:15.617 --> 19:17.991
Talk him out of it.

19:26.825 --> 19:27.825
Come on, Mack.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.824
Your ice cream's melting.
♪ I beg

19:30.825 --> 19:35.617
♪ You darling please come home

19:37.492 --> 19:41.700
♪ I love you more than
any words can tell

19:45.367 --> 19:47.574
♪ If the ice falls on our dreams

19:47.575 --> 19:51.117
♪ Pardons it to melt away

19:53.534 --> 19:57.741
♪ We'll be happy evermore
in the garden of dreams

20:01.158 --> 20:05.325
♪ Sun the moon
like us are lovers

20:11.283 --> 20:11.783
- You find anything?

20:11.784 --> 20:13.366
- Place is empty.

20:13.367 --> 20:14.325
- Not a fucking trace.

20:14.326 --> 20:15.408
- Call Ms. Parker.

20:15.409 --> 20:16.574
- Not yet.
- Not yet.

20:16.575 --> 20:18.157
This man's fucking dead.

20:18.158 --> 20:20.449
Okay, she's the only
one that can help us.

20:20.450 --> 20:21.574
- I thinking the
same damn thing.

20:21.575 --> 20:23.616
- How'd Ms. Parker
find out about the job?

20:23.617 --> 20:24.907
- She don't say.

20:24.908 --> 20:26.199
- She don't say.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.075
She found out from somebody?

20:27.076 --> 20:29.574
My guess is whoever
told Ms. Parker

20:29.575 --> 20:30.990
about this job set us up.

20:30.991 --> 20:31.367
- That's a big assumption.

20:31.368 --> 20:33.366
- Is it?

20:33.367 --> 20:34.782
I don't think so.

20:34.783 --> 20:37.574
I mean it's not just us they're
fucking with here, right?

20:37.575 --> 20:38.616
Ms. Parker's money's
in those bags too.

20:38.617 --> 20:39.617
- Make the call.

20:39.618 --> 20:41.533
- Tell her what?

20:41.534 --> 20:42.325
- The truth.

20:42.326 --> 20:43.699
- Oh, you think
she's gonna help.

20:43.700 --> 20:46.074
There's a dead body.

20:46.075 --> 20:47.616
She's gonna be packing her bags

20:47.617 --> 20:49.740
while I'm on the phone on
a flight within the hour

20:49.741 --> 20:52.116
drinking Mai Tai's on the
beach till the heat blows.

20:52.117 --> 20:53.491
- Hey, don't be a pussy.

20:53.492 --> 20:56.242
- Yeah, it's the
only play we got.

20:57.242 --> 20:58.242
Do it.

21:13.367 --> 21:14.824
- I thought no
cellphones were allowed

21:14.825 --> 21:16.157
at 40,000 feet.

21:16.158 --> 21:17.865
- I'm sorry.

21:17.866 --> 21:19.324
- For what?

21:19.325 --> 21:21.659
- For leaving the way I did.

21:22.450 --> 21:26.199
- You're not on the plane.

21:26.200 --> 21:27.949
- We had a hiccup.

21:27.950 --> 21:31.782
- A hiccup what
the hell does that mean?

21:31.783 --> 21:33.409
- Our pilot's dead.

21:34.908 --> 21:36.199
- And the take?

21:36.200 --> 21:38.074
- We still got it.

21:38.075 --> 21:40.324
- Why are you calling me?

21:40.325 --> 21:41.658
- I need a way out.

21:41.659 --> 21:43.534
I thought...

21:45.409 --> 21:46.824
I thought you could help.

21:46.825 --> 21:48.949
- You thought wrong.

21:48.950 --> 21:52.533
- Sarah, who gave you the job.

21:52.534 --> 21:54.157
- You think this was on my end?

21:54.158 --> 21:56.241
- I just need to make sure
it's not one of my guys.

21:56.242 --> 21:57.699
- I warned you about this.

21:57.700 --> 21:59.117
- I know you did.

21:59.991 --> 22:02.782
- The rat's on your end.

22:02.783 --> 22:05.033
Find him then we'll talk.

22:23.033 --> 22:23.659
- Well.

22:23.660 --> 22:25.575
- Well, what?

22:26.075 --> 22:28.491
It's like I said.

22:28.492 --> 22:30.116
- What does that mean?

22:30.117 --> 22:31.366
What the fuck does that mean?

22:31.367 --> 22:32.574
- We're not getting
help not from her.

22:32.575 --> 22:33.865
We're on our own.

22:33.866 --> 22:35.408
- Bullshit that's
fucking bullshit.

22:35.409 --> 22:37.199
- Dallas, easy.

22:37.200 --> 22:40.449
- It's what she does,
self-preservation.

22:40.450 --> 22:41.699
- What?

22:41.700 --> 22:43.199
What the fuck?

22:43.200 --> 22:44.574
Are you fucking kidding me, man?

22:44.575 --> 22:46.533
You're gonna defend
her with that bullshit.

22:46.534 --> 22:48.491
It was her job from the start.

22:48.492 --> 22:50.491
We got close to
25 mil over there

22:50.492 --> 22:51.990
including her fucking take,

22:51.991 --> 22:54.824
and she's not gonna stick
her neck out for what?

22:54.825 --> 22:56.116
Self-preservation?

22:56.117 --> 22:57.616
Are you fucking kidding me?

22:57.617 --> 22:58.242
- Oh, you think she's in on it?

22:58.242 --> 22:58.950
Is that what you think?

22:58.951 --> 23:01.074
- Dallas has got a point.

23:01.075 --> 23:01.950
It's a big take.

23:01.951 --> 23:03.491
- Don't tell me that cold bitch

23:03.492 --> 23:05.074
wouldn't burn us to take it all.

23:05.075 --> 23:06.075
- She wouldn't burn no one.

23:06.075 --> 23:07.033
- What are you
calling me a liar?

23:07.034 --> 23:08.699
- Yeah, I'm calling you a liar.

23:08.700 --> 23:11.033
- I'm not.
- Alright enough.

23:11.991 --> 23:14.782
This is how shit
starts going side ways.

23:14.783 --> 23:16.616
We start pointing
fingers, then guns.

23:16.617 --> 23:18.533
Pretty soon shit gets bloody
and we can't afford that.

23:18.534 --> 23:20.907
All this needs to be
spent figuring out

23:20.908 --> 23:22.157
what we're gonna do next.

23:22.158 --> 23:23.699
You two settle down.

23:23.700 --> 23:26.740
- We need to take
the fight to them.

23:26.741 --> 23:28.032
Alright whoever did
this is out there

23:28.033 --> 23:29.033
laughing at us right now.

23:29.034 --> 23:31.241
We have what they want, right

23:31.242 --> 23:31.991
four duffel's filled with cash.

23:31.992 --> 23:34.907
So we send someone out.

23:34.908 --> 23:36.533
We dangle the bait.

23:36.534 --> 23:38.033
We see what bites.

23:42.659 --> 23:44.033
Wanna go fishing?

24:13.659 --> 24:17.282
- You know Mack you never told
me what it was like inside.

24:17.283 --> 24:19.324
- It's not worth talking about.

24:19.325 --> 24:20.782
- You blame me.

24:20.783 --> 24:21.783
- No.

24:23.492 --> 24:25.616
I never said that.

24:25.617 --> 24:26.617
- Five minutes, Mack.

24:26.618 --> 24:28.990
Get in, get out, get clean.

24:28.991 --> 24:30.491
- I told you that safe
couldn't be cracked

24:30.492 --> 24:31.367
not in that time frame.

24:31.368 --> 24:33.658
- And I told you to leave it.

24:33.659 --> 24:34.990
We already had the
safety deposit boxes.

24:34.991 --> 24:36.865
We didn't need the vault.

24:36.866 --> 24:38.990
But you couldn't let it go.

24:38.991 --> 24:40.907
- I didn't expect you to stay.

24:40.908 --> 24:42.574
- Fuck you, Mack.

24:42.575 --> 24:43.575
Fuck you.

24:44.450 --> 24:46.282
After all we've been
through together,

24:46.283 --> 24:47.866
you say that to me.

24:49.158 --> 24:50.824
I waited for you as
long as we could.

24:50.825 --> 24:54.324
- Is that an apology?

24:54.325 --> 24:56.491
- Oh, that's beautiful.

24:56.492 --> 24:58.782
That is beautiful, Mack.

24:58.783 --> 24:59.783
I see you.

25:00.825 --> 25:01.990
I see you sitting in
that cell thinking about

25:01.991 --> 25:04.157
how things went wrong,

25:04.158 --> 25:05.534
how it all went to pieces.

25:17.075 --> 25:18.949
- You think I did this?

25:18.950 --> 25:20.659
- I never said that.

25:22.741 --> 25:24.533
- You think I killed Bartlett
just to fuck you over?

25:24.534 --> 25:27.990
- Who could blame you
for wanting to get even

25:27.991 --> 25:29.865
after all that time served.

25:29.866 --> 25:30.367
- So you think I'm a murderer.

25:30.367 --> 25:31.033
- You tell me.

25:31.034 --> 25:32.907
- I didn't want the money.

25:32.908 --> 25:34.991
- I never said you did.

25:36.866 --> 25:38.491
- Yeah, you know I did think
about that five minutes

25:38.492 --> 25:42.241
every day how I told you
there wasn't enough time.

25:42.242 --> 25:43.075
You didn't listen.

25:43.076 --> 25:44.241
You never listen.

25:44.242 --> 25:46.533
- Is that a confession, Mack?

25:46.534 --> 25:47.949
- You wanted this.

25:47.950 --> 25:49.491
You came to me, remember?

25:49.492 --> 25:50.492
I said no.

25:51.242 --> 25:53.283
All this that's on you.

26:23.741 --> 26:25.449
- Fuck.

26:25.450 --> 26:25.950
Fuck.

26:25.951 --> 26:28.990
Jesus, the money.

26:28.991 --> 26:29.783
- Fucking leave it.

26:29.784 --> 26:32.534
- Come on.
- The fucking money.

26:48.200 --> 26:50.408
- You running
from something, Jones?

26:50.409 --> 26:55.282
You enlist you go
overseas and then what?

26:55.283 --> 26:56.782
You get to thinking.

26:56.783 --> 27:01.366
You decide maybe these guys
will forget what I owe them.

27:01.367 --> 27:04.617
- No, you see I didn't
think I was coming back.

27:07.659 --> 27:09.366
- Here you are.

27:09.367 --> 27:11.824
- You always were the smart one.

27:11.825 --> 27:13.449
- You got jokes that's
one of the things

27:13.450 --> 27:16.408
he always liked about you
is your sense of humor.

27:16.409 --> 27:19.157
That's why he came to
pay you a courtesy.

27:19.158 --> 27:22.659
Tell you in person that
debt don't go away.

27:25.075 --> 27:26.782
He's gonna get what you owe.

27:26.783 --> 27:28.199
It's your choice.

27:28.200 --> 27:31.575
You're gonna pay in
dollar bills or blood.

27:32.783 --> 27:34.824
- I used to take
German in high school.

27:34.825 --> 27:37.157
I ever tell you that?

27:37.158 --> 27:39.740
Teacher was drunk all the time.

27:39.741 --> 27:41.367
He had that old man

27:42.367 --> 27:45.658
and stale Gin stench
about him, you know.

27:45.659 --> 27:47.324
You know the stench, Carver.

27:47.325 --> 27:49.324
His face always looked
like it was kind of like

27:49.325 --> 27:52.574
sliding off his skull sideways.

27:52.575 --> 27:55.492
Still I think he could
tag more ass than you.

28:00.700 --> 28:02.533
- You know you can't
just borrow money

28:02.534 --> 28:05.032
and not pay it back.

28:05.033 --> 28:06.533
That's when shit happens.

28:06.534 --> 28:09.866
- You know I fucking
see that now I do.

28:11.117 --> 28:12.907
So what happens next?

28:12.908 --> 28:15.199
You gonna come
back with two guys?

28:15.200 --> 28:16.283
- Two weeks.

28:17.825 --> 28:20.241
You got two weeks understand me?

28:20.242 --> 28:22.366
- Two weeks I got it.

28:22.367 --> 28:23.367
I got it.

28:23.950 --> 28:25.534
Carver,

28:26.783 --> 28:28.824
I'll see you soon.

28:28.825 --> 28:30.242
- Yeah, you will.

28:33.659 --> 28:34.033
- Ah, stop.

28:34.034 --> 28:35.865
Harrison.

28:35.866 --> 28:36.866
Mack, help.

28:42.617 --> 28:44.074
- We were on the
runway and he got hit.

28:44.075 --> 28:45.324
- Alright now.

28:45.325 --> 28:48.574
I'm just gonna pull this off.

28:48.575 --> 28:50.199
- Alright there we did it.

28:50.200 --> 28:51.200
- Shit.

28:54.700 --> 28:55.824
Turn him over.

28:57.534 --> 28:59.408
You're lucky the bullet
went right through.

28:59.409 --> 29:01.408
- Yeah, you wanna
fucking switch places?

29:01.409 --> 29:02.449
- Mack, get me some
bourbon alright?

29:02.450 --> 29:05.032
- The duffel fuck
the duffel on the

29:05.033 --> 29:05.783
- fucking runway.
- He got our money.

29:05.783 --> 29:06.492
- Alright don't worry about it.

29:06.492 --> 29:07.492
Just breathe, just breathe.

29:07.493 --> 29:09.990
Okay, we need something
to switch this up.

29:09.991 --> 29:11.491
Find me something
anything, okay?

29:11.492 --> 29:12.865
- Alright

29:12.866 --> 29:14.741
- Here you go
Jonesy here you go.

29:23.825 --> 29:25.116
- I got nothing.

29:25.117 --> 29:27.949
- Okay, find me a
crowbar anything metal.

29:27.950 --> 29:28.950
Okay, alright Mack.

29:28.951 --> 29:32.658
I need a flare or a
flame anything, okay.

29:32.659 --> 29:34.366
- Propane torch?
- Yeah, that should work.

29:34.367 --> 29:36.241
- I always wanted a
tattoo of a woman's name.

29:36.242 --> 29:37.449
I ever tell you fucks that,

29:37.450 --> 29:40.782
a bird one of those
old timey kinds

29:40.783 --> 29:44.782
with the name and the ribbon
hanging from the beak.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.032
I thought I'd meet
her in Mexico.

29:46.033 --> 29:47.282
- Don't get one Jonesy
you're too ugly.

29:47.283 --> 29:50.116
- All right yeah that's good.

29:50.117 --> 29:51.491
- I'm sorry Jonesy I'm sorry.

29:51.492 --> 29:53.533
- Light up the fucking cigarette
and stop being a pussy.

29:53.534 --> 29:56.241
- Okay, needs to get red hot.

29:56.242 --> 29:56.991
- Fuck you, bro.

29:56.992 --> 29:59.991
Where's that fucking smoke, man?

30:01.283 --> 30:02.033
- Okay, here we go.

30:02.034 --> 30:04.658
One, two, three.

30:07.825 --> 30:09.617
- Motherfucker.

30:16.825 --> 30:20.366
- Mack.

30:20.367 --> 30:23.492
I fucking missed you, man.

30:24.409 --> 30:26.699
- Let me buy you a drink.
- Absolutely.

30:26.700 --> 30:28.616
- Bourbon?
- No, beer back.

30:28.617 --> 30:31.158
- Alright, Katie line them up.

30:33.908 --> 30:36.283
So, how's it feel to be out?

30:38.700 --> 30:41.574
- Different but fucking good.

30:41.575 --> 30:42.950
- Here you go, D.

30:44.617 --> 30:45.699
- You might
wanna leave the bottle.

30:45.700 --> 30:46.700
I think that this
man could use a few.

30:46.701 --> 30:49.907
- Just don't go hitting
anyone, sweetheart.

30:49.908 --> 30:52.242
Bourbon makes him a asshole.

30:53.200 --> 30:54.865
- Sweetheart.

30:54.866 --> 30:56.282
- Yeah, well can you blame her.

30:56.283 --> 30:58.116
Look at this face.

30:58.117 --> 31:00.574
Cheers.

31:11.200 --> 31:12.200
- How's Gracie.

31:14.242 --> 31:15.366
- We're still together.

31:15.367 --> 31:17.574
- Am I an uncle yet?

31:17.575 --> 31:18.409
- Fuck, man take it easy.

31:18.410 --> 31:21.409
- Well, how would I know?

31:22.492 --> 31:24.032
You better watch out, man.

31:24.033 --> 31:25.699
You know a woman like that
who's got her mind set

31:25.700 --> 31:28.282
it's just a matter of time.

31:28.283 --> 31:29.283
- You're a shit.

31:34.991 --> 31:37.741
What about you any tail
since you been out?

31:44.200 --> 31:45.700
- Harrison told me

31:48.659 --> 31:51.617
about your fight,
about your hand.

31:53.075 --> 31:55.825
- Yeah, well fucking
Greeks right?

31:57.659 --> 31:59.616
- How much to fix it?

31:59.617 --> 32:00.617
- Too much.

32:01.908 --> 32:03.449
- Is that why you're
running with Harrison?

32:03.450 --> 32:06.116
- Jesus that's not your concern.

32:06.117 --> 32:07.117
- It's just a question.

32:07.118 --> 32:08.616
- Is that why you came here?

32:08.617 --> 32:10.699
- No, I came here to have a
drink with my fucking brother.

32:10.700 --> 32:13.074
- Well, then fucking
drink and stop talking.

32:13.075 --> 32:14.075
Fuck.

32:18.659 --> 32:22.699
It's like you said Gracie
gets what she wants

32:22.700 --> 32:25.950
and I'm not getting it done
anymore not like I used to.

32:31.825 --> 32:33.950
- I liked working on cars.

32:35.033 --> 32:36.033
I did.

32:37.033 --> 32:38.241
Right after they started
buying up the neighborhood

32:38.242 --> 32:41.032
things changed.

32:41.033 --> 32:41.866
We got evicted.

32:41.866 --> 32:42.825
They started building this bank

32:42.826 --> 32:44.574
across the street from the shop.

32:44.575 --> 32:46.824
I used to watch these lawyers

32:46.825 --> 32:50.616
and these trophy wives
going in and out all day.

32:50.617 --> 32:53.241
Making deposits on their beamers
and their minivans you know

32:53.242 --> 32:55.990
watching these people live
this dream while mom was dying.

32:55.991 --> 32:58.491
You were just a little kid.

32:58.492 --> 32:59.492
We needed money

33:01.158 --> 33:03.782
and all I had to do was walk
across the street and take it.

33:03.783 --> 33:04.783
- Did you.

33:05.534 --> 33:07.574
- Nah, I started buying safes

33:07.575 --> 33:11.157
practicing in the
shop's basement.

33:11.158 --> 33:14.617
Someone told Harrison
and the rest is...

33:16.825 --> 33:18.658
And everything I did

33:18.659 --> 33:21.491
I did to keep you in the
ring to keep you fighting,

33:21.492 --> 33:23.157
to keep you fighting for
something else, something more.

33:23.158 --> 33:25.782
- Don't put that shit on me
bro that was your choice.

33:25.783 --> 33:26.991
- Yeah, I know.

33:28.200 --> 33:29.658
Look, if I could go back,

33:29.659 --> 33:33.450
I would do everything
differently but I can't.

33:34.950 --> 33:37.157
And I gotta take
responsibility for my actions,

33:37.158 --> 33:41.158
and you running with
Harrison that's one of them.

33:46.866 --> 33:48.033
You got a girl.

33:49.200 --> 33:49.700
Take the money.

33:49.700 --> 33:50.617
Go fix that hand.

33:50.618 --> 33:53.533
Give it another shot, alright?

33:53.534 --> 33:55.367
- You know his rules.

33:56.700 --> 33:59.699
- Since when do you play by any?

33:59.700 --> 34:01.200
Look D I love you.

34:02.575 --> 34:05.617
Even if I'm shitty at it,

34:08.283 --> 34:10.033
I love you.

34:14.158 --> 34:15.158
Take it.

34:17.117 --> 34:20.991
♪ Have you ever heard the wind

34:24.158 --> 34:27.699
♪ Seen its chilling sight

34:29.991 --> 34:32.866
♪ And you can't hear nothing

34:42.617 --> 34:44.117
- Did you see him?

34:45.574 --> 34:46.864
- Yeah.

34:46.866 --> 34:47.617
- How was he?

34:47.618 --> 34:50.199
- He's good.

34:50.659 --> 34:52.574
- I'm worried.

34:54.117 --> 34:55.117
- About what?

34:56.908 --> 34:58.074
- Us.

34:58.075 --> 35:01.199
- It's gonna be fine I'm
gonna find something.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.324
- I don't want you
hanging with him.

35:03.325 --> 35:03.825
- He's my brother.

35:03.826 --> 35:04.950
- He's an ex-con.

35:08.283 --> 35:09.616
- Go back to sleep.
- Where are you going?

35:09.617 --> 35:10.865
- I'm not tired.
- Dallas.

35:10.866 --> 35:12.324
- What?
- Don't do this.

35:12.325 --> 35:14.199
- I have no idea what you're
talking about, Gracie.

35:14.200 --> 35:15.658
- We can get through
this together.

35:15.659 --> 35:17.491
Okay, I don't want
you hanging with him.

35:17.492 --> 35:18.200
- Let me ask you something.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.200
When did you start thinking

35:19.201 --> 35:21.449
you could tell me what
I can and can't do?

35:21.450 --> 35:22.283
- Whatever, D.

35:22.284 --> 35:23.908
Whatever.

35:32.492 --> 35:35.782
- So what happened?

35:35.783 --> 35:37.074
- Jones was right.

35:37.075 --> 35:40.324
He must've known
that we were coming.

35:40.325 --> 35:41.574
We saw a car.

35:41.575 --> 35:42.534
I fired back.

35:42.535 --> 35:45.157
I hit something but
Jones was already...

35:45.158 --> 35:48.491
- Dallas, he's gonna be fine.

35:48.492 --> 35:50.658
Jonesy's too stubborn to die.

35:50.659 --> 35:53.907
- I'm gonna find him.

35:53.908 --> 35:55.491
We gotta fine those
fuckers, Macky.

35:55.492 --> 35:56.492
- We will.

36:29.700 --> 36:33.074
- What's wrong.

36:33.075 --> 36:35.282
- I hate it when you do that.

36:35.283 --> 36:36.449
- What?

36:36.450 --> 36:37.866
- Read my mind.

36:39.700 --> 36:41.574
- Well, it's not that hard.

36:41.575 --> 36:42.865
You have a tell.

36:42.866 --> 36:44.533
- What's that?

36:44.534 --> 36:47.282
- You furrow your brow.

36:47.283 --> 36:48.283
- That's it.

36:49.033 --> 36:51.783
I give you too much credit then.

36:56.033 --> 36:57.033
- We can go.

36:59.075 --> 37:00.616
Right now I have enough.

37:00.617 --> 37:02.700
- And the job.

37:03.409 --> 37:04.699
- Someone else will step in.

37:04.700 --> 37:06.200
It's not too late.

37:09.200 --> 37:10.908
- I don't walk away.

37:11.908 --> 37:14.032
- You know doing
something for yourself

37:14.033 --> 37:17.659
doesn't make you a
horrible person, right?

37:21.242 --> 37:25.074
- Sarah, I'm gonna
tell you something.

37:25.075 --> 37:26.075
I was six.

37:30.700 --> 37:32.699
I was watching a
ball game on TV,

37:32.700 --> 37:35.574
and my daddy walked in the door.

37:35.575 --> 37:36.200
He fell to the floor.

37:36.201 --> 37:39.408
He was thrown from a car.

37:39.409 --> 37:41.783
He was all beaten and bloody.

37:43.450 --> 37:47.241
My mom and I we
tried to pick him up.

37:47.242 --> 37:48.574
But he was too drunk.

37:48.575 --> 37:51.116
He's too slippery
from all the blood.

37:51.117 --> 37:52.950
See he was a gambler.

37:53.991 --> 37:55.366
He borrowed money
from loan sharks.

37:55.367 --> 37:59.450
He was trying to balance
one debt from the other.

38:03.492 --> 38:07.283
I held his hand while I
watched him slip away.

38:09.283 --> 38:12.200
The whole time he
just kept saying,

38:13.200 --> 38:15.575
"It's gonna be just fine."

38:19.409 --> 38:22.325
I swore to myself I
would always pay my debt.

38:25.492 --> 38:26.617
- I'm sorry.

38:29.158 --> 38:30.158
- I owe them.

38:32.409 --> 38:34.825
- This isn't about your debt.

38:36.158 --> 38:38.616
- This was a mistake.

38:38.617 --> 38:39.367
- They made their own decision

38:39.368 --> 38:41.157
and all of you suffered for it.

38:41.158 --> 38:42.824
But you can't go back,

38:42.825 --> 38:44.700
and you can't fix it.

38:46.950 --> 38:48.491
There's a way that
you wish things were

38:48.492 --> 38:50.492
and then there's reality.

38:52.200 --> 38:55.617
- I told you I hate
it when you do that.

39:05.283 --> 39:08.449
- How's it going in there?

39:08.450 --> 39:09.533
- Who the fuck is this?

39:09.534 --> 39:14.157
- The one who tells
you what happens next.

39:14.158 --> 39:16.199
- You have no idea who
you're fucking with.

39:16.200 --> 39:18.990
- A washed
up boxer, an ex-con,

39:18.991 --> 39:22.658
a discharged Marine,
and a grifter

39:22.659 --> 39:25.740
I know exactly who you are.

39:25.741 --> 39:27.616
- I'm not the one
to worry about.

39:27.617 --> 39:28.949
- In the plane
there's a blueprint.

39:28.950 --> 39:31.907
On that blueprint is an X

39:31.908 --> 39:34.865
where I want you to
drop a second duffel.

39:34.866 --> 39:36.865
You do that and I let you go.

39:36.866 --> 39:38.282
- Go where you killed our pilot.

39:38.283 --> 39:42.283
- You have two
hours or I call the cops.

39:50.117 --> 39:52.157
- Well?

39:52.158 --> 39:55.199
- They say give
them another duffel.

39:55.200 --> 39:59.782
They let us go that
or they call the cops.

39:59.783 --> 40:03.116
- Oh, fuck that we
ain't giving them shit.

40:03.117 --> 40:05.366
- Agreed.
- What do we do now, huh?

40:05.367 --> 40:07.157
We just sit here
and watch Jones die?

40:07.158 --> 40:08.408
- That ain't gonna happen.

40:08.409 --> 40:10.241
- No, not if we get him
to a hospital it won't.

40:10.242 --> 40:11.117
- We need a car.

40:11.117 --> 40:11.991
We need a way outta here.

40:11.991 --> 40:12.866
- Yeah, right.

40:12.867 --> 40:13.990
We go outside they shoot us.

40:13.991 --> 40:16.199
We stay inside Jones dies.

40:16.200 --> 40:17.408
- Well, what's your idea, bro?

40:17.409 --> 40:19.157
- Look, we don't
know who's out there.

40:19.158 --> 40:20.824
We don't know how
many are out there.

40:20.825 --> 40:22.116
We're making blind decisions

40:22.117 --> 40:23.865
and just hoping one
of them pans out.

40:23.866 --> 40:26.157
I'm saying we consider
all our options.

40:26.158 --> 40:27.324
- You wanna do it.

40:27.325 --> 40:28.699
You wanna give them the duffel.

40:28.700 --> 40:30.616
- Look, it might buy
us some time alright.

40:30.617 --> 40:32.116
We can retrace our steps.

40:32.117 --> 40:33.616
We figure out what the fuck
is going on here, alright.

40:33.617 --> 40:34.200
We'll track down
these motherfuckers.

40:34.201 --> 40:36.658
But we do it our way.

40:36.659 --> 40:37.367
- Are you fucking
kidding me, man?

40:37.368 --> 40:40.074
They ain't gonna let us go.

40:40.075 --> 40:41.491
They got us right up
against the ropes right now.

40:41.492 --> 40:43.199
And they're gonna keep
on coming until we drop.

40:43.200 --> 40:46.032
- Why are you in such a
rush to give away our take?

40:46.033 --> 40:49.282
- To keep him alive.
- Oh, go on.

40:49.283 --> 40:50.117
Say it, Mack.

40:50.118 --> 40:51.241
Go on, say it.

40:51.242 --> 40:52.449
- Say it right now.
- Say what?

40:52.450 --> 40:54.282
- Say it come on ask
your brother, Dallas.

40:54.283 --> 40:55.533
- Ask him.
- Say what?

40:55.534 --> 40:56.367
What the fuck are
you talking about?

40:56.367 --> 40:57.367
- Ask him.

40:58.617 --> 40:59.949
- Harrison thinks I'm the rat.

40:59.950 --> 41:02.574
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:02.575 --> 41:04.157
What?

41:04.158 --> 41:05.491
What happened to Miss Parker?

41:05.492 --> 41:06.907
- This has nothing
to do with her.

41:06.908 --> 41:09.616
- Are you kidding me man
this was all her idea.

41:09.617 --> 41:11.491
She set this whole thing up

41:11.492 --> 41:13.116
the hangar, coming
here to catch a plane

41:13.117 --> 41:15.157
the way out it was all her idea.

41:15.158 --> 41:17.449
- She wouldn't kill anyone.

41:17.450 --> 41:19.157
- How do you know that?

41:19.158 --> 41:21.449
All I see is the four
of us hung out to dry.

41:21.450 --> 41:23.658
If there's a rat,
it's that bitch.

41:23.659 --> 41:24.740
- That's enough, Dallas.

41:24.741 --> 41:26.409
You back the fuck off.

41:30.825 --> 41:32.659
- Holy shit.

41:35.367 --> 41:36.575
Holy shit, bro.

41:38.659 --> 41:39.824
He's fucking her.

41:39.825 --> 41:40.825
- What?

41:41.950 --> 41:44.283
- Is that true?

41:50.783 --> 41:52.242
- That's great.

41:52.991 --> 41:54.825
That's fucking great.

41:56.409 --> 41:57.409
She used you.

41:58.325 --> 42:01.032
She used you to set us up.

42:01.033 --> 42:03.074
Is she out there, Harrison?

42:03.075 --> 42:04.783
Did she shoot Jones?

42:05.950 --> 42:07.699
Is she letting you stir
this pot to a boil?

42:07.700 --> 42:08.907
- I am not the one

42:08.908 --> 42:10.074
who wants to give our
money away, remember.

42:10.075 --> 42:12.074
- It's him.
- Oh, yeah?

42:12.075 --> 42:13.699
- It's him.
- Yeah.

42:15.325 --> 42:16.367
- Stay cool stay cool.

42:19.242 --> 42:21.366
- Talk to me
baby you're scaring me.

42:21.367 --> 42:23.116
- Why won't you tell
me what's going on?

42:23.117 --> 42:23.866
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

42:23.867 --> 42:25.865
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

42:25.866 --> 42:26.825
You know what I'm not
gonna do this with you.

42:26.826 --> 42:30.865
I am not gonna stand
here and watch you.

42:30.866 --> 42:32.492
- I found this in your pocket.

42:34.450 --> 42:35.574
- So?

42:35.575 --> 42:38.408
- So, is there something
you wanna tell me?

42:38.409 --> 42:39.782
- It's a phone number, D.

42:39.783 --> 42:41.616
- Whose phone number?

42:41.617 --> 42:43.157
- A friend of Annie's.

42:43.158 --> 42:45.907
We were out my phone
died she wrote it down.

42:45.908 --> 42:47.074
- Annie did?
- Her friend did.

42:47.075 --> 42:48.574
- It was a she?

42:48.575 --> 42:49.907
- Alright, Dallas I'm not
gonna do this with you.

42:49.908 --> 42:51.782
- Tell me what's
going on, goddamn it.

42:51.783 --> 42:52.990
Don't you fucking lie to me.

42:52.991 --> 42:54.408
- I just did.

42:54.409 --> 42:55.865
- Yeah, well, who
is this person?

42:55.866 --> 42:56.990
- Who are you talking about?

42:56.991 --> 43:00.157
- The friend of Annie's, Gracie.

43:00.158 --> 43:01.241
- Dallas, I don't...
- 'Cause, you know what

43:01.242 --> 43:05.907
when I called he didn't
really wanna talk to me.

43:05.908 --> 43:07.533
Look at me.

43:07.534 --> 43:09.116
- I told you, D.

43:09.117 --> 43:10.740
It was just some guy.

43:10.741 --> 43:11.824
He was hitting on me at the bar.

43:11.825 --> 43:12.783
- Some guy.
- It's not a big deal.

43:12.784 --> 43:14.740
- Some fucking guy.

43:14.741 --> 43:15.409
- Yeah, I just put his number...

43:15.410 --> 43:17.658
- And you kept his number?

43:17.659 --> 43:18.617
- So.

43:18.618 --> 43:19.907
- Did you call him?

43:19.908 --> 43:21.032
- What do you want
me to say to you?

43:21.033 --> 43:23.241
- Did you call him?

43:23.242 --> 43:25.116
- D, please.

43:25.117 --> 43:27.782
- Where's your phone at?
- I'm sorry.

43:27.783 --> 43:29.199
- Where's your fucking phone at?

43:29.200 --> 43:31.950
- It's not a big deal.

43:33.409 --> 43:37.325
- Jesus Christ how long
has this been going on?

43:42.866 --> 43:43.450
How long?

43:43.451 --> 43:46.366
- Give me my phone back.

43:46.367 --> 43:47.367
Dallas, wait.

44:01.158 --> 44:02.366
- You okay?

44:02.367 --> 44:05.075
- Yeah, what the
fuck is going on?

44:06.659 --> 44:09.157
- I can't take this shit.

44:09.158 --> 44:10.616
- We got a call.

44:10.617 --> 44:13.659
The guns outside
want another duffel.

44:14.866 --> 44:16.658
- They let you in here, huh?

44:16.659 --> 44:17.949
For how much?

44:17.950 --> 44:19.616
- Two bills.

44:19.617 --> 44:20.782
- You're not exactly
the influence

44:20.783 --> 44:23.033
I had in mind for my rehab.

44:26.033 --> 44:28.866
Not that I give a shit.

44:40.617 --> 44:43.616
They don't let you have
this shit overseas.

44:43.617 --> 44:45.574
Not where I was.

44:45.575 --> 44:46.575
- I got your message.

44:49.200 --> 44:51.659
- I didn't think you'd come.

44:53.825 --> 44:58.825
- So your stint in the
military didn't work out then?

45:00.242 --> 45:03.242
- What does it look like?

45:06.741 --> 45:07.908
I want back in.

45:12.908 --> 45:17.158
- Dallas has got a fight
Saturday night a big one.

45:18.492 --> 45:21.907
Could be the break
we're waiting for.

45:21.908 --> 45:25.199
He's always looked at you
like a brother you know that.

45:25.200 --> 45:27.575
Why don't you come?

45:28.741 --> 45:29.865
- Yeah.

45:29.866 --> 45:33.241
- Saturday night I'll
pick you up at five.

45:33.242 --> 45:36.282
- Does this mean you
got a spot for me?

45:36.283 --> 45:39.117
- There's always a spot for you.

45:40.075 --> 45:41.450
- Hey.

45:43.866 --> 45:44.990
- Keep it.

45:44.991 --> 45:47.990
- No, man, I'm trying
a new leaf I gotta.

45:47.991 --> 45:52.242
- Come on Jonesy
that ain't gonna kill ya.

46:14.950 --> 46:16.241
- I don't know
what they're doing.

46:16.242 --> 46:17.408
I don't know it's a
fucking shit show.

46:17.409 --> 46:19.282
- I used to be
great at ping pong.

46:19.283 --> 46:20.782
I ever tell you that?

46:20.783 --> 46:22.157
- What?

46:22.158 --> 46:24.199
- My older stepbrother
should've been Asian, man.

46:24.200 --> 46:25.324
He used to win
every fucking game.

46:25.325 --> 46:27.282
Except one night I had him.

46:27.283 --> 46:29.699
I was up seven points.

46:29.700 --> 46:30.824
It was game point,

46:30.825 --> 46:33.282
and then he pulled some
ninja shit and won.

46:33.283 --> 46:35.574
I was so fucking pissed off

46:35.575 --> 46:38.199
I punched a hole through
the wall with my paddle.

46:38.200 --> 46:40.824
My stepmom didn't let
me play for a month.

46:40.825 --> 46:42.865
Wanted me to learn perspective.

46:42.866 --> 46:44.658
- That's fucking great, Jones.

46:44.659 --> 46:46.491
- Perspective.

46:46.492 --> 46:48.367
So he calls the cops.

46:49.325 --> 46:50.325
Then what?

46:50.991 --> 46:52.324
The cartel isn't
gonna tell anyone

46:52.325 --> 46:54.074
their drug money's gone missing.

46:54.075 --> 46:56.449
Shit.

46:56.450 --> 46:58.157
No one's ever gonna know we
were in that fucking bank, man.

46:58.158 --> 47:01.408
But Bartlett's body

47:01.409 --> 47:05.949
that's the fucking thing
that ties us to a crime.

47:05.950 --> 47:10.408
The bag is filled with
how much weight you think?

47:10.409 --> 47:12.324
- A buck, buck fifty, maybe.

47:12.325 --> 47:14.324
- Think we could fit 200?

47:14.325 --> 47:15.782
- I'm not following.

47:15.783 --> 47:19.366
- Well, you used to box it,
light heavyweight, right?

47:19.367 --> 47:20.367
- Right.

47:20.368 --> 47:24.158
- So that would make
our pilot a heavyweight.

47:25.409 --> 47:26.367
- You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

47:26.368 --> 47:27.740
- We fucking send
them a bag of bones.

47:27.741 --> 47:30.658
We tell them if
they want the money,

47:30.659 --> 47:33.200
they gotta come in and get it.

47:35.367 --> 47:37.199
Anyone got a hacksaw?

47:40.534 --> 47:41.782
Give me your gun.

47:41.783 --> 47:42.367
- It's not loaded.

47:42.368 --> 47:44.449
- I don't give a fuck.

47:44.450 --> 47:45.659
- Neither do I.

47:48.200 --> 47:50.033
- Look, man a mugging

47:51.575 --> 47:54.491
cops don't give a
piss about a mugging.

47:54.492 --> 47:55.907
Alright beat him so
bad he can't walk.

47:55.908 --> 47:57.282
He can't talk.

47:57.283 --> 48:01.117
We put a cap in him this
whole thing blows up.

48:02.242 --> 48:03.282
Alright not just the job.

48:03.283 --> 48:05.991
You, me, your brother.

48:07.908 --> 48:15.282
Everything.

48:15.283 --> 48:16.283
Southpaw.

48:17.367 --> 48:20.033
Don't knock his
head off you got me?

48:20.783 --> 48:23.824
- I thought it'd
pay off, Jonesy.

48:23.825 --> 48:28.199
Thought I'd be able to pay
her back for everything.

48:28.200 --> 48:29.408
- Nah, brother.

48:29.409 --> 48:32.241
This has nothing to do with
what happened in the ring.

48:32.242 --> 48:33.740
Alright, the bitch
is cheating on you.

48:33.741 --> 48:35.033
- Are you sure?

48:35.492 --> 48:37.617
- She's a whore.

48:38.908 --> 48:40.449
That's what whores do.

48:40.450 --> 48:41.574
♪ I don't care

48:41.575 --> 48:42.616
♪ I will kill

48:42.617 --> 48:43.824
♪ I will kill you too

48:43.825 --> 48:48.449
- Hey, just make sure
he's still breathing.

48:48.450 --> 48:50.492
- You stay in the car.

48:52.825 --> 48:53.825
- Fuck.

48:54.741 --> 48:57.783
♪ Can't you tell you'll
end up on the floor

49:00.242 --> 49:04.449
♪ You'll end up on the floor

49:04.450 --> 49:08.283
♪ You'll end up on the floor

49:09.700 --> 49:11.990
- What are you doing with her?

49:11.991 --> 49:13.366
- Excuse me.
- Gracie.

49:13.367 --> 49:14.283
The girl in the bar.

49:14.283 --> 49:14.825
- Do I know you?

49:14.826 --> 49:17.324
- Not yet.

49:17.325 --> 49:21.575
- Hey, man she didn't tell
me she had a boyfriend.

49:24.617 --> 49:25.658
I told you she
didn't say anything.

49:25.659 --> 49:28.491
- She's wearing a
ring, motherfucker.

49:28.492 --> 49:30.199
- I didn't know.

49:30.200 --> 49:31.366
- Here's what's
gonna happen next.

49:31.367 --> 49:32.616
You're not gonna call.

49:32.617 --> 49:33.658
You're not gonna text.

49:33.659 --> 49:35.866
You're gonna disappear
you got that?

49:41.325 --> 49:43.574
- Feel better now?

49:43.575 --> 49:46.950
- I told you to stay in the car.

49:48.325 --> 49:51.617
- Hey, better to know
now though right?

49:53.908 --> 49:55.409
- What'd you say?

49:57.492 --> 49:59.700
- I mean I'd wanna know.

50:00.325 --> 50:02.367
If I were you,

50:03.200 --> 50:05.241
I'd wanna know
all about my girl.

50:05.242 --> 50:06.866
- What?

50:08.825 --> 50:10.324
You fucking her?

50:10.325 --> 50:11.325
- I didn't say that.

50:17.325 --> 50:19.241
- Alright that's enough.

50:19.242 --> 50:20.659
That's enough.

50:21.700 --> 50:24.367
That's enough, Dallas, come on.

50:25.242 --> 50:26.242
Let's go.

50:26.617 --> 50:28.575
Let it go, bro.

51:02.659 --> 51:06.450
- You are playing with fire.

51:09.075 --> 51:10.950
I warned you about this.

51:15.200 --> 51:16.866
The rat's on your end.

51:18.075 --> 51:20.199
Find him then we'll talk.

51:28.825 --> 51:30.324
- What the fuck is this?

51:30.325 --> 51:31.907
- It's the new plan.
- Says who?

51:31.908 --> 51:33.449
- We don't need your permission.

51:33.450 --> 51:34.949
- He wants another
duffel dropped here on site

51:34.950 --> 51:36.324
at this small building.

51:36.325 --> 51:38.491
- We're gonna send him
a bag of fucking bones.

51:38.492 --> 51:40.740
Send him a message and we
get rid of the fucking body.

51:40.741 --> 51:41.865
- That's it?

51:41.866 --> 51:44.032
That's your fucking
plan that's beautiful.

51:44.033 --> 51:46.116
You guys are playing cowboys
so you don't have to look at

51:46.117 --> 51:48.116
the shit staring you
in the fucking face.

51:48.117 --> 51:50.533
Somewhere along the
line someone got greedy.

51:50.534 --> 51:52.074
Someone thinks
they deserve more.

51:52.075 --> 51:53.658
- Yeah, did you talk to the
girl that you're fucking?

51:53.659 --> 51:54.659
Maybe she has some insight.

51:54.660 --> 51:55.782
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

51:55.783 --> 51:56.990
- What the fuck, man?

51:56.991 --> 51:59.366
- Man, put the fucking gun away.

51:59.367 --> 52:00.533
- I told you this has got
nothing to do with her.

52:00.534 --> 52:01.949
- No, then why are
you hiding behind a gun?

52:01.950 --> 52:04.199
- Everybody take
a second, alright.

52:04.200 --> 52:05.949
The only way to beat the heat
is to stay cool, Harrison.

52:05.950 --> 52:06.783
You taught me that.

52:06.784 --> 52:08.116
- This is an inside job.

52:08.117 --> 52:09.990
- Brother.
- Open your eyes, Jonesy.

52:09.991 --> 52:11.658
Someone said something, alright.

52:11.659 --> 52:12.824
You got nothing to lose.

52:12.825 --> 52:14.699
And Dallas he's got
no fucking brain.

52:14.700 --> 52:16.699
- Say that to my face.

52:16.700 --> 52:17.990
- Fucking take it easy.

52:17.991 --> 52:19.574
Harrison, put that
fucking gun away.

52:19.575 --> 52:20.492
- Harrison, what if
you're wrong, huh?

52:20.493 --> 52:21.990
What if we're not
the guy who did it?

52:21.991 --> 52:23.824
Those guys outside they
ain't gonna stop coming.

52:23.825 --> 52:25.616
- Yeah, you're gonna
tell us who they are

52:25.617 --> 52:26.990
and we'll figure out
what we do after.

52:26.991 --> 52:28.574
- Easy now.
- You are so full of shit.

52:28.575 --> 52:29.283
- Easy, Dallas.

52:29.284 --> 52:30.574
- You don't have the balls.

52:30.575 --> 52:31.575
- Oh yeah, try me Dallas.

52:31.576 --> 52:33.824
- Well, then what's
the problem go ahead.

52:33.825 --> 52:35.408
Pull the trigger motherfucker.

52:35.409 --> 52:36.907
- I told you that this has
got nothing to do with you.

52:36.908 --> 52:39.699
- You fuck with my
brother you fuck with me.

52:39.700 --> 52:41.782
- Stop it.
- Bring it on.

52:43.409 --> 52:44.574
- Nobody's shooting anyone.

52:44.575 --> 52:46.658
- Jonesy.

52:46.659 --> 52:49.491
- You shoot him I shoot you.

52:49.492 --> 52:51.491
- Harrison, this
doesn't have to happen.

52:51.492 --> 52:52.824
- Come on, Jonesy.

52:52.825 --> 52:54.616
You know this wasn't me.

52:54.617 --> 52:56.950
- Yeah, wasn't Mack either.

52:58.741 --> 53:01.075
- Harrison, the gun.

53:10.825 --> 53:11.865
- Five minutes.

53:11.866 --> 53:14.366
- Not yet.
- You know the rules.

53:14.367 --> 53:16.574
- It's still quiet.

53:16.575 --> 53:18.032
- I'll give you 45 more seconds.

53:18.033 --> 53:19.282
- You're not getting me.

53:19.283 --> 53:20.782
We ain't fucking
going without him.

53:20.783 --> 53:22.366
- We rise together
we fall together.

53:22.367 --> 53:24.408
- Sometimes pigs go dark
don't use their radios.

53:24.409 --> 53:24.991
They could be on their way.

53:24.992 --> 53:26.658
- Not in Ohio, dude.

53:26.659 --> 53:28.991
We're fucking fine.

53:30.991 --> 53:31.908
- Fuck.
- This is why

53:31.909 --> 53:34.116
you fuckers should carry phones.

53:34.117 --> 53:35.574
- One call, one text,

53:35.575 --> 53:37.116
take your eye off
the prize one second

53:37.117 --> 53:38.408
and shit can slide south.

53:38.409 --> 53:39.865
One focus.

53:39.866 --> 53:40.990
One phone.

53:40.991 --> 53:42.449
One number for when
the job is done.

53:42.450 --> 53:43.200
- Fucking brilliant.

53:43.201 --> 53:45.324
- He'll be here he'll make it.

53:45.325 --> 53:47.241
- Stop being a fucking pussy.

53:47.242 --> 53:48.616
- Five and a half.

53:48.617 --> 53:50.574
- You know, Mack and I

53:50.575 --> 53:53.324
we took 25K off our first grab.

53:53.325 --> 53:55.574
He popped that fault
like it was a soda can.

53:55.575 --> 53:57.990
I ain't seen anybody
move that fast.

53:57.991 --> 53:59.241
But the driver got in his mind

53:59.242 --> 54:00.699
that he was gonna grab
the take for himself.

54:00.700 --> 54:01.700
He tried to shoot me.

54:01.701 --> 54:03.574
Mack took the bullet.

54:03.575 --> 54:04.409
So you wanna leave, leave.

54:04.410 --> 54:06.282
Open the door and
get the fuck out.

54:06.283 --> 54:07.824
- Hey, he's your boy.

54:07.825 --> 54:10.907
I get that but you're
running out of time.

54:10.908 --> 54:13.032
- Will you stop being
a fucking pussy?

54:13.033 --> 54:16.283
We ain't fucking going
anywhere until the man says so.

54:20.033 --> 54:20.825
- 19-9
Sarge any units there

54:20.826 --> 54:23.616
respond at 78th Street.

54:23.617 --> 54:25.116
- Yeah I got two
police on assignment.

54:25.117 --> 54:26.117
The one on 98th
and 5th following

54:26.118 --> 54:29.824
and the other one at
85 East End Avenue.

54:31.075 --> 54:32.075
- It's time.

54:37.409 --> 54:37.908
- Go, go now.

54:37.909 --> 54:39.616
- No. Harrison.

54:39.617 --> 54:40.907
We're not fucking leaving Mack.

54:40.908 --> 54:42.825
We're not leaving him.

54:59.825 --> 55:00.825
- Traitor.

55:08.950 --> 55:12.242
- You're right about the body.

55:13.825 --> 55:16.575
We're gonna have
to get rid of it.

55:30.367 --> 55:31.367
- Fuck.

55:32.659 --> 55:34.492
I can't do it, Mack.

55:41.283 --> 55:42.783
- I got this, bro.

55:51.575 --> 55:52.907
God help me.

55:57.575 --> 55:59.908
I'm not a Catholic, father.

56:01.450 --> 56:04.409
- Do you have a confession?

56:07.534 --> 56:09.492
- I didn't believe in God

56:10.741 --> 56:13.282
not until I was on the
floor in cell block A,

56:13.283 --> 56:16.241
blood was in my eyes my
jaw was smashed sideways.

56:16.242 --> 56:18.242
No one was coming for me.

56:20.700 --> 56:21.700
No one.

56:27.575 --> 56:30.783
I've seen plenty of
people beg, father

56:32.700 --> 56:35.574
for their mothers,

56:35.575 --> 56:36.825
for their wives,

56:42.659 --> 56:46.242
and the only person I
called out to was God.

56:48.950 --> 56:49.950
- Go on.

56:51.033 --> 56:54.534
- The pain didn't go
away but the fear did.

57:01.825 --> 57:02.783
And I made a promise.

57:02.784 --> 57:05.949
I made a promise that
I wouldn't go back

57:05.950 --> 57:08.241
to the way things were before.

57:08.242 --> 57:10.699
And now I gotta break
that promise, father.

57:10.700 --> 57:11.740
- Why?

57:11.741 --> 57:12.741
- Family.

57:15.075 --> 57:16.075
Family.

57:19.783 --> 57:20.783
- Wait.

57:24.450 --> 57:27.241
I don't know what you're facing.

57:27.242 --> 57:29.866
But I do know God will provide.

57:33.242 --> 57:34.741
If you ask for it,

57:35.991 --> 57:39.492
whatever you think you
need to do you don't.

57:43.158 --> 57:44.908
- I'm not worth it.

57:46.534 --> 57:47.950
- None of us are.

57:48.991 --> 57:51.450
But he's there just the same.

57:52.741 --> 57:54.157
- I think he'll understand.

57:54.158 --> 57:56.367
I'm not sure but
for what it's worth

57:58.325 --> 58:01.659
and for what's about
to happen, I'm sorry.

58:18.492 --> 58:21.241
You know, Harrison's got a point

58:21.242 --> 58:24.074
as fucked up as it
sounds, you know.

58:24.075 --> 58:26.324
Yeah, we've been good for what,

58:26.325 --> 58:27.825
15 jobs or so now?

58:29.242 --> 58:31.740
Ms. Parker's hooked us
up with all of them.

58:31.741 --> 58:34.324
If something went wrong.

58:34.325 --> 58:35.658
If it was Harrison,

58:35.659 --> 58:36.865
he would've thought it through.

58:36.866 --> 58:40.241
If it was him, he
would've been cool.

58:40.242 --> 58:41.242
Calculated.

58:42.075 --> 58:43.783
This is just sloppy.

58:45.741 --> 58:48.157
- Yeah,

58:48.158 --> 58:49.699
we all know Mack cares
more about cracking a safe

58:49.700 --> 58:52.157
than what's inside of it, so

58:52.158 --> 58:55.117
that leaves me,
you, and Ms. Parker.

58:56.200 --> 58:57.491
- You know me, Jones.

58:57.492 --> 58:59.241
- And you know me, brother.

58:59.242 --> 59:00.865
I wouldn't fuck you over.

59:00.866 --> 59:02.949
Then I wouldn't have anyone
to drink on the beach with.

59:02.950 --> 59:05.865
- Cut the loyalty shit, Jonesy.

59:05.866 --> 59:07.574
He blew like the wind.

59:07.575 --> 59:08.865
Always did.

59:08.866 --> 59:11.533
Why don't you tell your
drinking buddy, Dallas

59:11.534 --> 59:12.409
about how many men
you left behind.

59:12.410 --> 59:14.740
I heard it was five.

59:14.741 --> 59:16.241
- What's he talking about, bro?

59:16.242 --> 59:18.282
- He left Marines to die.

59:18.283 --> 59:20.032
- You don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

59:20.033 --> 59:21.616
- Oh, you don't think
I checked up on you

59:21.617 --> 59:23.074
before I pulled you
out of the gutter

59:23.075 --> 59:25.449
for a second time, Jonesy?

59:25.450 --> 59:26.824
Oxy.

59:26.825 --> 59:29.616
Is that the drug of
choice for a patriot?

59:29.617 --> 59:31.074
How many you take to
swallow the truth?

59:31.075 --> 59:34.409
- Fuck you, you fucking fuck.

59:35.741 --> 59:37.699
- Who are you to judge, huh?

59:37.700 --> 59:38.865
Five years.

59:38.866 --> 59:41.241
Five fucking years you
left me for those pigs.

59:41.242 --> 59:43.116
You wanna talk
about cut and run.

59:43.117 --> 59:46.282
You're the king of cut and run.

59:46.283 --> 59:47.574
Burn everything, right?

59:47.575 --> 59:49.533
Burn everything
and burn everyone.

59:49.534 --> 59:50.949
Isn't that what you taught me?

59:50.950 --> 59:52.074
For what?

59:52.075 --> 59:54.907
It's never gonna be enough.

59:54.908 --> 59:56.449
There's always gonna
be more to take.

59:56.450 --> 59:58.116
Another job or a bigger score.

59:58.117 --> 59:59.408
You're walking away.

59:59.409 --> 01:00:02.074
You're retiring on a
beach with Cervezas.

01:00:02.075 --> 01:00:02.950
Tell me that's
just a fucking lie.

01:00:02.951 --> 01:00:05.199
It's a fucking lie
you tell yourself.

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.366
And you're gonna
be chasing that lie

01:00:06.367 --> 01:00:08.199
until it fucking kills you.

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:10.533
- Come one relax.

01:00:10.534 --> 01:00:12.865
Take a walk and
have a cigarette.

01:00:12.866 --> 01:00:14.199
- Go on, Dallas.

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:16.074
Come on take a look.

01:00:16.075 --> 01:00:18.491
Oh, you don't know
him like I do.

01:00:18.492 --> 01:00:19.991
Go on take a look.

01:00:46.534 --> 01:00:47.534
- Come on, bro.

01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:50.950
You ready?

01:00:52.991 --> 01:00:53.991
Fuck.

01:01:03.741 --> 01:01:07.741
- Pain killers don't kill
the pain just numb it.

01:01:10.033 --> 01:01:12.782
When they wear off
that shit's still there

01:01:12.783 --> 01:01:17.324
like a fucking migraine
splitting your skull.

01:01:17.325 --> 01:01:20.282
Sometimes you
can't see straight.

01:01:20.283 --> 01:01:21.616
Sometimes you vomit.

01:01:21.617 --> 01:01:23.324
Sometimes you close
yourself in a dark room

01:01:23.325 --> 01:01:27.241
and you just try to wait it out.

01:01:27.242 --> 01:01:28.659
None of it works.

01:01:29.866 --> 01:01:33.699
Turns out that you can't
run from your past.

01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:36.199
Who the fuck are
you to judge me?

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.575
- I get it, Jonesy.

01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:42.950
'66 GTU.

01:01:45.367 --> 01:01:49.032
Purred like a lion
when you kicked it on.

01:01:49.033 --> 01:01:50.033
Candy apple red,

01:01:52.409 --> 01:01:54.783
black stripe down the center

01:01:56.075 --> 01:01:59.157
ripe for the picking.

01:01:59.158 --> 01:02:01.616
I don't blame you for
trying to jack it.

01:02:01.617 --> 01:02:02.699
- This ain't about that.

01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:03.907
- Oh, yeah it is.

01:02:03.908 --> 01:02:07.116
See I pulled you out
of the gutter twice,

01:02:07.117 --> 01:02:09.200
alright twice.

01:02:11.866 --> 01:02:14.907
And you sit there and
you talk about loyalty.

01:02:14.908 --> 01:02:17.534
And I am tied to
a fucking chair.

01:02:18.741 --> 01:02:20.491
Come on, Jonesy.

01:02:20.492 --> 01:02:22.199
This is an inside job.

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.575
And we are on the outside.

01:02:26.575 --> 01:02:27.866
Come on, Jonesy.

01:02:29.242 --> 01:02:30.242
Come on.

01:02:30.991 --> 01:02:33.283
Come on, Jonesy.

01:02:34.075 --> 01:02:35.491
Come one.

01:03:21.158 --> 01:03:22.783
- Fuck.

01:03:25.534 --> 01:03:27.866
Where are you, motherfucker?

01:03:54.825 --> 01:03:56.075
Jones, you fuck.

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.033
- Wow, that's a
nice toilet Carver.

01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:09.324
Sorry about the aftermath.

01:04:09.325 --> 01:04:11.199
- You're a tough guy hiding

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.325
hiding behind the needle.

01:04:14.033 --> 01:04:15.659
- Are you looking for this?

01:04:17.783 --> 01:04:19.074
I found it for you.

01:04:19.075 --> 01:04:20.907
- Fuck, Jones.

01:04:20.908 --> 01:04:21.908
Fuck you.

01:04:25.783 --> 01:04:28.699
- Here's why you're
such a smart bastard.

01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:31.865
Did you really read
all these, Carver?

01:04:31.866 --> 01:04:32.866
- Fuck you.

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:38.117
- The Brothers Karamazov

01:04:39.409 --> 01:04:41.991
This is a fucking
classic, Carver.

01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:46.700
Yeah, buddy.

01:04:48.242 --> 01:04:50.866
It sucks when the
shit goes down.

01:04:52.033 --> 01:04:53.700
And all you can do is lie there

01:04:57.741 --> 01:04:59.824
and fucking take it.

01:04:59.825 --> 01:05:02.199
Can't move nowhere to go.

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:03.659
No one to help.

01:05:05.367 --> 01:05:07.492
And there goes your rug.

01:05:10.866 --> 01:05:13.700
- You're fucking dead
man you understand me?

01:05:16.492 --> 01:05:17.658
- I couldn't.

01:05:17.659 --> 01:05:19.782
You got a lot of
shit in your mouth.

01:05:19.783 --> 01:05:21.950
- This isn't over, Jones.

01:05:23.575 --> 01:05:24.825
- For you it is.

01:05:58.325 --> 01:05:59.866
- I should've listened to you.

01:06:02.075 --> 01:06:05.741
Now you're here and
it's all gone to shit.

01:06:06.409 --> 01:06:08.616
- It's not over yet.

01:06:08.617 --> 01:06:11.741
- Why'd you take the fall?

01:06:12.617 --> 01:06:13.991
I don't get that.

01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:17.324
You did five years for Harrison

01:06:17.325 --> 01:06:19.574
but he would burn
you in a heartbeat.

01:06:19.575 --> 01:06:21.241
- He's confused.

01:06:21.242 --> 01:06:22.491
- No, don't that.

01:06:22.492 --> 01:06:23.533
- No, it's true.

01:06:23.534 --> 01:06:25.575
- Answer the question.

01:06:26.492 --> 01:06:27.492
- Alright.

01:06:30.325 --> 01:06:32.617
It was my fault.

01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:37.824
- You all pulled the job.

01:06:37.825 --> 01:06:39.534
You were all guilty.

01:06:40.659 --> 01:06:42.367
- It was the bank, D

01:06:43.908 --> 01:06:44.908
the bank.

01:06:46.033 --> 01:06:49.491
The one across the street
from the auto shop.

01:06:49.492 --> 01:06:51.199
I was stealing from the
people that took from us.

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.617
I was trying to take it back.

01:06:54.741 --> 01:06:56.616
It was supposed to be just
the safe deposit boxes.

01:06:56.617 --> 01:07:01.366
But once I got inside I
was obsessed with that safe

01:07:01.367 --> 01:07:04.574
with cracking it and
setting fire to the vault.

01:07:04.575 --> 01:07:06.865
I needed to get inside.

01:07:06.866 --> 01:07:10.533
And I didn't care what
happened to anyone else.

01:07:10.534 --> 01:07:13.825
Anger and hate don't die easy.

01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:16.865
And I couldn't let that go.

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:21.242
So the man upstairs
he made me pay for it.

01:07:23.534 --> 01:07:24.534
Okay?

01:07:25.242 --> 01:07:27.033
- I get it.

01:07:34.158 --> 01:07:36.700
She was cheating on me, Macky.

01:07:38.325 --> 01:07:40.534
I didn't tell her anything.

01:07:43.075 --> 01:07:47.117
Whatever she did it was
because I wasn't there.

01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:55.409
- You still got that
cash I gave you, right?

01:07:55.410 --> 01:07:57.324
- It's stashed away.

01:07:57.325 --> 01:07:59.699
- Okay, so what happens next?

01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:01.366
So I'm gonna go back
and finish the job

01:08:01.367 --> 01:08:04.241
and you're gonna go into
town and call an ambulance.

01:08:04.242 --> 01:08:06.074
- Fuck no.

01:08:06.075 --> 01:08:06.741
Fuck no I'm not leaving.

01:08:06.742 --> 01:08:08.782
- Jones needs an ambulance.

01:08:08.783 --> 01:08:09.990
- We can use Harrison's phone.

01:08:09.991 --> 01:08:11.574
- You can't be here.

01:08:11.575 --> 01:08:13.408
- I won't leave, Mack.

01:08:13.409 --> 01:08:17.658
- We call an ambulance it
shows up we all go to prison.

01:08:18.741 --> 01:08:20.157
And, let me tell you something.

01:08:20.158 --> 01:08:23.241
Five years in a cell
fucks with your head.

01:08:23.242 --> 01:08:25.990
Nothing left but your own
thoughts screaming the what ifs,

01:08:25.991 --> 01:08:28.157
the should have dones.

01:08:28.158 --> 01:08:31.990
And the only thing that
kept me sane the whole time

01:08:31.991 --> 01:08:35.198
was knowing that you
were out here in the ring

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:37.782
fighting for
something different.

01:08:37.783 --> 01:08:40.741
Me, Harrison, and Jones

01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:46.991
we deserve what's coming.

01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:51.200
But you, not you.

01:08:53.367 --> 01:08:54.367
Not you.

01:08:57.325 --> 01:08:59.573
So you take that money

01:08:59.575 --> 01:09:00.740
and you fix that hand.

01:09:00.741 --> 01:09:03.282
And you give it another go.

01:09:03.283 --> 01:09:04.658
You do that.

01:09:04.658 --> 01:09:05.865
You do that for me.

01:09:05.866 --> 01:09:06.617
- It's complicated
I can't do that.

01:09:06.618 --> 01:09:09.073
- It really isn't.

01:09:09.075 --> 01:09:11.617
- Macky, I'm not leaving you.

01:09:12.575 --> 01:09:16.198
- Can you still run
the six minute mile?

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:17.616
- I smoke a pack a day.

01:09:17.617 --> 01:09:20.282
- Right, you better get going.

01:09:20.283 --> 01:09:21.283
- Mack.

01:09:22.325 --> 01:09:23.950
Mack.

01:09:35.575 --> 01:09:38.241
Dispatch to car 109.

01:09:38.242 --> 01:09:40.823
- Over I thought
you'd be drunk by now.

01:09:40.825 --> 01:09:42.073
- Short straws.

01:09:42.075 --> 01:09:43.366
Rest of the boys
and three sheets.

01:09:43.367 --> 01:09:44.200
Listen this is probably nothing.

01:09:44.201 --> 01:09:45.616
But we got a call
about shots fired

01:09:45.617 --> 01:09:47.032
at the air stripe hangar.

01:09:47.033 --> 01:09:49.241
- It's a fucking holiday.

01:09:49.242 --> 01:09:50.158
- It's
probably nothing, Timperman.

01:09:50.158 --> 01:09:53.866
But we need someone
to check it out.

01:10:55.617 --> 01:10:57.575
- Yo, Jonesy.

01:11:02.158 --> 01:11:04.282
- Where's your brother?

01:11:04.283 --> 01:11:05.283
- He's gone.

01:11:27.617 --> 01:11:29.367
- Hey, Mack

01:11:30.659 --> 01:11:32.865
you know the worst
part of the job

01:11:32.866 --> 01:11:36.157
walking away after it's done.

01:11:36.158 --> 01:11:38.950
Yeah, you gotta wash your hands,

01:11:39.741 --> 01:11:41.449
burn the clothes,

01:11:41.450 --> 01:11:43.949
walk down the street
like nothing happened.

01:11:43.950 --> 01:11:47.157
No one knows what you've done.

01:11:47.158 --> 01:11:48.699
I like to walk past the bank.

01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:50.700
Key a cop car

01:11:51.659 --> 01:11:56.032
while the cops are
inside trying to find us.

01:11:56.033 --> 01:11:59.491
One last fuck you
before I hop on a plane

01:11:59.492 --> 01:12:01.157
and head out of town.

01:12:01.158 --> 01:12:03.865
And that's what this is, Mack

01:12:03.866 --> 01:12:06.491
one last fuck you.

01:12:07.991 --> 01:12:09.199
- You just left him?

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:10.117
You left him at the bank.

01:12:10.118 --> 01:12:11.324
You left him in prison to rot.

01:12:11.325 --> 01:12:14.699
You're just fucking
leaving him now

01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:16.032
Man this isn't us.

01:12:16.033 --> 01:12:18.409
We're getting through this.

01:12:21.450 --> 01:12:26.116
- Alright, let me tell you
how this is gonna go down.

01:12:26.117 --> 01:12:27.782
Me and my hostage we're
gonna take your car

01:12:27.783 --> 01:12:30.658
and drive away or I'm gonna
put a bullet in his head.

01:12:30.659 --> 01:12:31.949
- Relax no one has to die here.

01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:34.740
- Who the fuck are you?

01:12:34.741 --> 01:12:37.865
You think you can talk me down?

01:12:37.866 --> 01:12:40.282
We walk or he dies.

01:12:40.283 --> 01:12:42.116
I'm taking one of you with me.

01:12:42.117 --> 01:12:44.157
- Stay where you are.

01:12:44.158 --> 01:12:45.449
- What are you doing?

01:12:45.450 --> 01:12:47.408
- We rise together.

01:12:47.409 --> 01:12:48.367
We fall together.

01:12:48.367 --> 01:12:49.283
- Jonesy.

01:12:49.284 --> 01:12:51.032
- No one gets left behind.

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:52.033
Not this time.

01:12:55.450 --> 01:12:56.367
- Drop your weapon.

01:12:56.368 --> 01:12:58.117
- Drop your weapon.

01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:02.907
- Are you okay?

01:13:02.908 --> 01:13:03.908
Are you okay?

01:13:03.909 --> 01:13:06.075
Timperman, are you okay?

01:14:17.617 --> 01:14:20.157
- I thought
you weren't interested.

01:14:20.158 --> 01:14:22.741
- Changed my mind.

01:14:23.325 --> 01:14:25.157
- Tell me why.

01:14:25.158 --> 01:14:27.658
- It's for family.

01:14:27.659 --> 01:14:29.324
- You don't have any.

01:14:29.325 --> 01:14:30.990
- Not that you know of.

01:14:33.575 --> 01:14:36.782
After this they can walk away.

01:14:36.783 --> 01:14:38.616
And all the shit everything
I put them through

01:14:38.617 --> 01:14:42.825
will be a distant memory and
they can put it behind them.

01:14:45.825 --> 01:14:48.200
Give us the job.

01:14:51.158 --> 01:14:52.158
- It's yours.

01:14:53.617 --> 01:14:54.617
- Thank you.

01:14:58.991 --> 01:15:02.783
Someday soon, Sarah,
it'll be just you and me.

01:15:04.492 --> 01:15:08.241
We'll find a place in
wine country by the sea

01:15:08.242 --> 01:15:10.450
and just drink red wine and

01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:14.908
and I'll just look
at you all day long,

01:15:18.242 --> 01:15:19.242
all day long.

01:15:42.866 --> 01:15:44.032
- Hello?

01:15:44.033 --> 01:15:47.741
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, thank god.

01:15:48.866 --> 01:15:50.616
- Do you love me?

01:15:50.617 --> 01:15:52.032
- Where the hell are you?

01:15:52.033 --> 01:15:52.700
- Answer the question.

01:15:52.701 --> 01:15:55.157
- Of course I do.

01:15:55.158 --> 01:15:56.865
Baby, what's happening?

01:15:56.866 --> 01:15:57.866
- I need to know.

01:16:00.534 --> 01:16:02.116
I need to know about that
guy that you've been calling

01:16:02.117 --> 01:16:06.032
the guy you've been seeing.

01:16:06.033 --> 01:16:08.907
'Cause if you love me you
wouldn't lie to me right?

01:16:08.908 --> 01:16:11.241
- D, please.

01:16:11.242 --> 01:16:12.491
- Please, what?
- Please tell me

01:16:12.492 --> 01:16:13.075
you're gonna understand
when I tell you this.

01:16:13.076 --> 01:16:15.408
- Who is he please?

01:16:15.409 --> 01:16:17.241
- I thought
something was going down.

01:16:17.242 --> 01:16:18.117
You weren't coming home.

01:16:18.118 --> 01:16:19.282
You weren't talking to me.

01:16:19.283 --> 01:16:20.658
- So what you started
fucking somebody?

01:16:20.659 --> 01:16:23.199
- No, alright listen.

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:24.366
There was money in the bank
but you weren't working.

01:16:24.367 --> 01:16:27.116
And I thought you were
working with Harrison.

01:16:27.117 --> 01:16:30.074
So I had to do something.

01:16:30.075 --> 01:16:31.782
- Fuck Gracie fuck.

01:16:31.783 --> 01:16:34.116
- See it was for
you, you gotta understand.

01:16:34.117 --> 01:16:35.949
- Well, tell me who
he is what's his name?

01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:38.282
- He's a private detective.

01:16:38.283 --> 01:16:39.865
- You had me followed?

01:16:39.866 --> 01:16:41.116
Goddamn it.

01:16:41.117 --> 01:16:42.907
- D.
- God.

01:16:42.908 --> 01:16:44.574
- Baby, no.

01:16:44.575 --> 01:16:46.074
- Did you know?
- Know what?

01:16:46.075 --> 01:16:48.116
- About the bank, the money

01:16:48.117 --> 01:16:49.949
the fucking money did you know?

01:16:49.950 --> 01:16:51.157
- What bank
are you talking about?

01:16:51.158 --> 01:16:52.241
- Jesus Christ don't lie to me.

01:16:52.242 --> 01:16:54.491
- I'm not lying to you.

01:16:54.492 --> 01:16:55.949
I don't know all I know is
that he was tailing you.

01:16:55.950 --> 01:16:56.950
That's it.

01:16:58.117 --> 01:17:00.241
Baby, please you
gotta understand.

01:17:00.242 --> 01:17:01.990
Please, you gotta understand.

01:17:01.991 --> 01:17:03.409
I did it for you.

01:17:04.617 --> 01:17:07.574
- There's 50K in my
gym bag in the closet.

01:17:07.575 --> 01:17:10.074
- Oh, please, baby.

01:17:10.075 --> 01:17:11.658
- I'll call when I can.

01:17:11.659 --> 01:17:14.200
- Please I love you.

01:17:15.741 --> 01:17:17.324
- Fuck.

01:18:45.325 --> 01:18:46.617
- Bad day, huh?

01:18:56.575 --> 01:18:57.700
You fucks are something.

01:18:59.033 --> 01:19:00.534
I take one duffel.

01:19:02.825 --> 01:19:03.908
I shoot a guy.

01:19:05.242 --> 01:19:06.907
And then you give
me a second duffel.

01:19:06.908 --> 01:19:11.533
How you guys pulled off this
job while being that dumb

01:19:11.534 --> 01:19:13.033
I will never know.

01:19:18.492 --> 01:19:20.950
Now where are the last bags?

01:19:23.283 --> 01:19:24.408
- You killed them.

01:19:24.409 --> 01:19:25.659
- Where are the duffel's?

01:19:29.158 --> 01:19:31.782
- I'll show you.

01:19:31.783 --> 01:19:33.158
- You'll tell me.

01:19:34.367 --> 01:19:36.658
- How long you
think you got, huh?

01:19:36.659 --> 01:19:38.700
More cops will be coming.

01:19:39.866 --> 01:19:42.783
- It's not them that
you have to worry about.

01:19:49.908 --> 01:19:53.283
- You untie me or
you find it yourself.

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:56.575
- They thought it was you.

01:19:59.825 --> 01:20:01.700
Oh, you sad sorry
bunch of fucks.

01:20:31.575 --> 01:20:35.617
- I tell you what
I'll make you a deal?

01:20:36.575 --> 01:20:37.990
- Yeah.

01:20:37.991 --> 01:20:38.950
- Yeah.

01:20:38.951 --> 01:20:41.866
I'll give you a duffel
for your wallet.

01:20:44.450 --> 01:20:47.325
- Keep moving.

01:20:50.783 --> 01:20:51.783
Now.

01:21:16.866 --> 01:21:18.659
- Can you help me out here, huh?

01:21:51.033 --> 01:21:52.033
- All of it.

01:22:08.741 --> 01:22:11.782
- Now how 'bout that wallet?

01:22:11.783 --> 01:22:14.366
- So you're the funny one?

01:22:14.367 --> 01:22:15.700
On your knees.

01:22:30.617 --> 01:22:31.741
You see the sad thing is

01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:35.907
is that when I started
following you guys

01:22:35.908 --> 01:22:37.533
I wanted to see you
get away with it.

01:22:37.534 --> 01:22:41.200
But your brother
he's a real fuck.

01:22:46.450 --> 01:22:49.032
- You know my brother?

01:22:49.033 --> 01:22:50.450
- Not really. No.

01:22:52.450 --> 01:22:53.450
- Fuck.

01:22:55.950 --> 01:22:58.199
Oh, yeah now I see
it on your face.

01:22:58.200 --> 01:22:59.908
Yeah, he's been there.

01:23:04.783 --> 01:23:07.824
You should stop
while you're ahead.

01:23:07.825 --> 01:23:09.825
Now that was just a tap.

01:23:13.492 --> 01:23:14.492
- Hey,

01:23:15.659 --> 01:23:17.492
how does it feel, huh

01:23:18.492 --> 01:23:21.824
to be this close to
getting away with it

01:23:21.825 --> 01:23:26.825
and then to get here and
to see it all go to shit?

01:23:28.617 --> 01:23:31.866
You see that plane sitting
there just laughing at you.

01:23:34.033 --> 01:23:35.367
How does it feel?

01:23:37.283 --> 01:23:38.617
- You tell me.

01:24:27.783 --> 01:24:29.158
Sorry, my friend.

01:24:50.242 --> 01:24:52.325
- What the fuck happened?

01:25:46.242 --> 01:25:48.865
- You know I used to
play chess with my dad

01:25:48.866 --> 01:25:52.325
when he wasn't drunk not to win

01:25:53.450 --> 01:25:55.449
but to keep him at the board,

01:25:55.450 --> 01:25:58.366
stay alive as long as possible,

01:25:58.367 --> 01:26:01.866
play for the dead
draw, game no one wins.

01:26:03.075 --> 01:26:03.991
Because, when it was
over that's when he would

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:07.075
pick up the bottle
and start hitting.

01:26:09.325 --> 01:26:13.325
That's you now because
that woman you stole from,

01:26:14.866 --> 01:26:18.199
it's only a matter of time
'til she ends the game.

01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:19.658
So you're gonna start running.

01:26:19.659 --> 01:26:21.949
And she's gonna start hunting.

01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:23.241
Might take a week,

01:26:23.242 --> 01:26:26.659
might take a year but
she will find you.

01:26:31.575 --> 01:26:32.616
Come on.

01:26:32.617 --> 01:26:34.865
- Give me a second.

01:26:34.866 --> 01:26:36.283
- Keep him alive.

01:27:03.158 --> 01:27:04.865
- Are you okay?

01:27:04.866 --> 01:27:05.950
- It's Mack.

01:27:07.117 --> 01:27:09.740
- I told him not to trust you.

01:27:09.741 --> 01:27:13.408
- Someone followed us.

01:27:13.409 --> 01:27:15.574
- And the damage?

01:27:15.575 --> 01:27:18.534
- Jones and Harrison
are both dead.

01:27:19.659 --> 01:27:22.866
- Who was the rat?

01:27:23.908 --> 01:27:27.783
- Some private eye he
was tailing one of us.

01:27:28.908 --> 01:27:30.033
- You have him?

01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:33.117
- No, he got away

01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:37.325
but he won't get far.

01:27:39.825 --> 01:27:41.991
His name is Scott Jackson

01:27:42.783 --> 01:27:45.283
from Chicago, 222 West Huron.

01:27:46.908 --> 01:27:48.282
He's carrying a duffel.

01:27:48.283 --> 01:27:50.782
Inside that duffel you'll
find the pilot that he killed.

01:27:50.783 --> 01:27:54.199
- I'll make a few calls.

01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:58.200
- I left your take in the
hangar, yours and Harrison's.

01:27:59.450 --> 01:28:02.740
It's in a cardboard
box in an air vent.

01:28:02.741 --> 01:28:05.949
Once the heat blows
over it's yours.

01:28:05.950 --> 01:28:08.367
- Mack, tell me how.

01:28:14.825 --> 01:28:17.907
- He died so we could get away.

01:28:17.908 --> 01:28:20.242
- Of course he did.

01:28:21.825 --> 01:28:24.491
- He loved you, you know.

01:28:24.492 --> 01:28:25.991
- I know.

01:28:28.825 --> 01:28:29.991
- I'm sorry.

01:28:48.866 --> 01:28:51.659
- So what happens next?

01:28:53.492 --> 01:28:55.575
- We get back in the ring.

01:28:58.534 --> 01:29:00.658
You got a smoke?

01:29:00.659 --> 01:29:01.575
- I'm out.

01:29:01.575 --> 01:29:02.575
- Fuck.
