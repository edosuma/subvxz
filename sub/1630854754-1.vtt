40:00.465 --> 40:03.768
- When the twins walk in,
I gag.

40:03.768 --> 40:06.871
I think they're very annoying
because it's like mm, baby.

40:06.871 --> 40:09.173
[kissing noises]
And I'm just like--

40:09.173 --> 40:11.342
- So first week's going to be
a double elimination.

40:11.342 --> 40:13.011
- Ooh!
- OK.

40:13.011 --> 40:14.445
- Hi.
- Oh, my God.

40:14.445 --> 40:15.813
[all greeting]

40:15.813 --> 40:18.950
- So me and Spice started
doing drag on social media.

40:18.950 --> 40:22.153
We have accumulated
7 million followers on TikTok.

40:22.153 --> 40:24.088
- Did any of y'all recognize
us from TikTok?

40:24.088 --> 40:25.690
- I did, yeah.

40:25.690 --> 40:27.325
- No.
- No.

40:27.325 --> 40:29.327
- I do know them,
but I'm not going to give them

40:29.327 --> 40:31.562
the satisfaction that I do.

40:31.562 --> 40:32.797
Never heard of you, baby.

40:32.797 --> 40:35.466
- Girls, I'm stuck
in my childhood forever.

40:35.466 --> 40:37.168
So like, that's why we're
life-size dolls.

40:37.168 --> 40:38.870
Like--
[breathy] hi, I'm Spice.

40:38.870 --> 40:39.904
I'm a doll.

40:39.904 --> 40:41.306
I'm plastic.
- Oh, my God.

40:41.306 --> 40:43.041
That's scary.
It's like Chucky, Annabelle.

40:43.041 --> 40:44.642
[laughter]

40:44.642 --> 40:45.710
- I'll be the Chucky of drag.

40:45.710 --> 40:46.944
- And I'm, like, the plastic,

40:46.944 --> 40:48.279
like, fun, like, Barbie,

40:48.279 --> 40:49.747
you know,
just the prettier one.

40:49.747 --> 40:51.449
- Well, we always say, she's
kind of like Regina George,

40:51.449 --> 40:52.817
and I'm Janis Ian, you know.

40:52.817 --> 40:54.052
- So is this
what you do on TikTok?

40:54.052 --> 40:55.486
Y'all, like, rehearse lines,
and then you just

40:55.486 --> 40:56.487
say all your lines
all the time?

40:56.487 --> 40:57.722
[laughter]

40:57.722 --> 40:59.424
- Honestly, our names
are Sugar and Spice,

40:59.424 --> 41:01.426
but we should really just
be called Canned and Bit.

41:01.426 --> 41:03.328
- Yeah, we have so many bits,
and they're so canned.

41:03.328 --> 41:04.862
- Oh, we love a good bit.

41:06.397 --> 41:08.933
- It's a lot!
It's a lot! It's a lot!

41:08.933 --> 41:10.902
I'm swiping.
I don't want to see it anymore.

41:10.902 --> 41:13.404
Keep going.
Next, next, next.

41:13.404 --> 41:14.739
Where are you guys from?

41:14.739 --> 41:16.507
- We're from Long Island,
New York.

41:16.507 --> 41:18.142
all: Oh.

41:18.142 --> 41:20.311
- But we just moved to LA
a couple months ago, so--

41:20.311 --> 41:21.446
- You did?
- Yes.

41:21.446 --> 41:23.114
both: Yeah.
- Where do you perform?

41:23.114 --> 41:24.382
- Um...
- In our room.

41:24.382 --> 41:26.117
- Ohh.

41:26.117 --> 41:27.485
I thought so.
I never seen you hos.

41:27.485 --> 41:29.487
- Did you guys, like, do,
like, more performance shows

41:29.487 --> 41:32.523
when you were back home, or
have you guys been more, like--

41:32.523 --> 41:34.258
- We have done
some performances.

41:34.258 --> 41:36.127
- We have, like,
one or two performances,

41:36.127 --> 41:37.595
and they were a nightmare.

41:37.595 --> 41:39.831
- So y'all don't perform and,
like, do actual drag?

41:39.831 --> 41:42.266
- Yeah, it's
a drag competition, baby.

41:42.266 --> 41:44.869
- I'm used to other drag queens
not really seeing me

41:44.869 --> 41:46.671
as a quote, unquote,
"drag queen,"

41:46.671 --> 41:48.873
but I definitely want
to change that misconception.

41:48.873 --> 41:51.309
I'm dying to be a part
of a drag community,

41:51.309 --> 41:53.378
and I'm hoping here
I'll be able to make friends,

41:53.378 --> 41:56.214
and we can just go home
and bake a big drag queen pie,

41:56.214 --> 41:58.316
and we can all live
happily ever after.

41:58.316 --> 41:59.851
Wait, so is this everyone?

41:59.851 --> 42:02.053
- I feel like there's only
half of us here so far.

42:02.053 --> 42:03.121
Guys, do you think
that they're going to do,

42:03.121 --> 42:04.722
like, the split premiere thing?

42:04.722 --> 42:06.391
- What if the other girls
already came,

42:06.391 --> 42:08.559
and we're, like,
the second batch?

42:08.559 --> 42:09.894
- No, but there would have
been stuff in here though.

42:09.894 --> 42:11.129
- I was literally
just thinking that.

42:11.129 --> 42:12.563
Yeah, no, it looks too clean.

42:12.563 --> 42:13.664
- It's season 15.

42:13.664 --> 42:15.066
Something has to be up.

42:16.768 --> 42:19.637
[sci-fi music]

42:19.637 --> 42:21.639
- Ornacia?
- Oh, there's another one.

42:21.639 --> 42:23.608
- What is going on?

42:23.608 --> 42:25.710
Is Vivacious coming back
to compete?

42:25.710 --> 42:27.512
I'm so confused.

42:27.512 --> 42:28.880
What's happening?

42:28.880 --> 42:29.881
- She's back.

42:29.881 --> 42:31.082
- Milk it, girl, milk it.

42:31.082 --> 42:33.451
Reveal, reveal, reveal.

42:33.451 --> 42:35.086
- No. Wait, no.

42:35.086 --> 42:37.221
[suspenseful music]

42:37.221 --> 42:39.424
- Mother has arrived.

42:39.424 --> 42:41.025
[all screaming]

42:41.025 --> 42:43.227
- Vivacious, in the flesh.

42:43.227 --> 42:45.029
Are we doing
an early out season?

42:45.029 --> 42:48.666
- No, really,
Mother has arrived.

42:48.666 --> 42:49.700
Look over there.

42:49.700 --> 42:52.370
[dramatic music]

42:52.370 --> 42:53.538
- Hello, hello, hello.

42:53.538 --> 42:56.474
[all screaming]

42:56.474 --> 43:01.612
- I am gagged to finally
see RuPaul in person.

43:01.612 --> 43:03.247
- Oh, my God!

43:03.247 --> 43:04.315
- It's happening.

43:04.315 --> 43:05.483
It's happening.

43:05.483 --> 43:06.784
I'm feeling the feels.

43:06.784 --> 43:10.555
- Welcome to
"RuPaul's Drag Race" Season 15.

43:10.555 --> 43:12.323
[all cheering]

43:12.323 --> 43:15.326
Now, in honor of Vivacious,
Ornacia,

43:15.326 --> 43:18.062
and all the Queens
who have come before you,

43:18.062 --> 43:21.732
I'm counting on each of you
to take us to new heights

43:21.732 --> 43:23.668
of drag excellence.

43:23.668 --> 43:24.735
Are you up for the challenge?

43:24.735 --> 43:26.537
- Hell, yeah.
- Yeah, baby.

43:26.537 --> 43:27.839
- And Vivacious,

43:27.839 --> 43:30.208
I hear you're going to hang out
with us today.

43:30.208 --> 43:31.509
- Lies.

43:31.509 --> 43:33.544
Liza Minnelli. Lies.

43:33.544 --> 43:34.846
[laughter]

43:34.846 --> 43:36.814
- Well, I hate
to see you leave,

43:36.814 --> 43:39.016
but I love
to watch you walk away.

43:39.016 --> 43:43.554
Vivacious, show these children
how it is done.

43:43.554 --> 43:46.190
- Anything for you, Mother.

43:46.190 --> 43:47.558
- Work it, girl.

43:47.558 --> 43:49.460
[all cheering]

43:49.460 --> 43:51.395
- Ow, ow, ow.

43:52.864 --> 43:54.966
- Mother has departed.

43:54.966 --> 43:56.567
[laughter]

43:56.567 --> 43:59.537
Now, for your very first
mini challenge,

43:59.537 --> 44:02.707
we're going to go back
to our roots.

44:02.707 --> 44:05.543
All you have to do
is strike a pose

44:05.543 --> 44:07.979
and blow me away.

44:07.979 --> 44:09.647
[all muttering nervously]

44:09.647 --> 44:10.815
- Oh, God.

44:10.815 --> 44:12.216
- Good luck,

44:12.216 --> 44:14.118
and don't fuck it up.

44:15.353 --> 44:16.754
- I love taking photos.

44:16.754 --> 44:19.423
So I'm like, oh, thank God,
something I can do.

44:19.423 --> 44:21.192
I just have to stand there
and look pretty, you know.

44:21.192 --> 44:22.727
Let's start the season off
with a bang.

44:24.061 --> 44:27.565
[rock music]

44:27.565 --> 44:31.335
- These are my favorite outfits
the Pit Crew has ever worn.

44:32.270 --> 44:34.505
- Yeah. [laughs]

44:34.505 --> 44:35.740
Trend alert.

44:35.740 --> 44:38.442
Salina EsTitties.

44:38.442 --> 44:39.577
- Hi!

44:39.577 --> 44:41.646
- Hello.
- Hi there, Ru.

44:41.646 --> 44:45.249
- Inspired by the season two
premiere photo shoot,

44:45.249 --> 44:47.318
get ready to be blown away.

44:47.318 --> 44:49.153
Uh-oh!
- [laughs]

44:49.153 --> 44:52.156
- We are trading cannons
for crotch rockets.

44:52.156 --> 44:54.592
But speaking of crotch rockets,

44:54.592 --> 44:56.060
say hello to the Pit Crew.

44:56.060 --> 44:57.728
- Hi, daddy.
[giggles]

44:57.728 --> 45:00.131
- Assume the position,
straddle that hog.

45:01.365 --> 45:04.368
Not that hog,
the other one, yeah.

45:04.368 --> 45:06.203
- Baby, it feels so amazing
that I get

45:06.203 --> 45:07.605
to be a part of the legacy.

45:07.605 --> 45:08.940
OK, we are here.

45:08.940 --> 45:10.675
Season 15,
the quinceañera, baby.

45:10.675 --> 45:11.976
Let's go.

45:11.976 --> 45:14.679
- The important thing is
to connect with the camera

45:14.679 --> 45:16.147
no matter what happens.

45:16.147 --> 45:17.481
You want to make love to it.

45:17.481 --> 45:18.816
- Oh.
- We are looking

45:18.816 --> 45:20.318
for a fabulous shot.

45:20.318 --> 45:22.620
- All right.
- Make room for Bruno.

45:22.620 --> 45:24.188
Fan setting one.

45:24.188 --> 45:25.489
- There we go. There we go.

45:25.489 --> 45:27.792
- OK.
Faster, pussycat.

45:27.792 --> 45:29.260
Kill, kill.

45:29.260 --> 45:30.661
Hairography, honey.

45:30.661 --> 45:31.929
- I feel like a model.

45:31.929 --> 45:33.664
I'm just living in the wind,

45:33.664 --> 45:34.865
and I hear RuPaul go--

45:34.865 --> 45:36.200
- Connect with the camera.

45:36.200 --> 45:38.202
- And I'm like, am I not
connecting with the camera?

45:38.202 --> 45:40.905
Because I'm connecting
with Bruno, bitch.

45:40.905 --> 45:41.906
I am living.

45:41.906 --> 45:43.441
- Bruno, look out
for those trees.

45:43.441 --> 45:45.242
- Oh!
OK, we can do this.

45:45.242 --> 45:46.677
Maple le--oh!
[spits]

45:46.677 --> 45:48.412
OK. Ohh.

45:48.412 --> 45:49.981
- Full tilt boogie.

45:49.981 --> 45:51.115
- You ready, Bruno?

45:51.115 --> 45:52.650
I don't fuck around!

45:52.650 --> 45:54.485
We're going
to beat this traffic!

45:54.485 --> 45:56.187
- [laughing]
- Aah!

45:58.656 --> 46:01.792
- I will see you
in traffic school.

46:01.792 --> 46:03.828
Hey, sis, it's Amethyst.

46:03.828 --> 46:06.364
- [screams]

46:06.364 --> 46:07.531
Put on your seat belt!

46:07.531 --> 46:08.899
- [laughs]

46:08.899 --> 46:11.402
Here comes Oktoberfest.

46:11.402 --> 46:13.537
Hey, remember,
the camera's over here.

46:13.537 --> 46:15.706
- It's really hard
to concentrate,

46:15.706 --> 46:18.242
especially when leaves
are being thrown at you.

46:18.242 --> 46:21.345
And I am quite literally
eating them.

46:21.345 --> 46:24.215
- Oh, my goodness.
[laughs]

46:24.215 --> 46:25.983
Turn it up to 11.

46:25.983 --> 46:27.284
Hold on tight.

46:27.284 --> 46:29.687
Yes. [laughs]

46:29.687 --> 46:32.723
Watch out for that bus.

46:32.723 --> 46:37.061
All right, Jax, I think you're
approaching the Rose Parade.

46:38.896 --> 46:40.998
Yeah, whip that hair, yeah.

46:40.998 --> 46:44.335
- I am so excited
to be paying homage

46:44.335 --> 46:46.370
to season two of "Drag Race."

46:46.370 --> 46:48.105
- Yeah, ass to ass.

46:48.105 --> 46:49.607
[laughs]

46:49.607 --> 46:52.543
- I'm thinking I did
pretty good in this challenge.

46:52.543 --> 46:54.645
However, I could have
been feeling myself

46:54.645 --> 46:56.147
but looking like a thumb.

46:56.147 --> 46:58.182
- Who's driving this thing?

46:58.182 --> 47:00.484
[laughing]

47:00.484 --> 47:02.853
Oh, look out
for those pedestrians.

47:02.853 --> 47:06.857
Paging
Mistress Isabelle Brooks.

47:06.857 --> 47:10.294
It looks like you're heading up
on a flock of seagulls.

47:10.294 --> 47:11.962
Oh, dear.

47:11.962 --> 47:13.197
Are you a bird lady?

47:13.197 --> 47:15.132
- [clucks]
- [clucks]

47:15.132 --> 47:18.069
- My eyelash is blowing,
my wig is shifting,

47:18.069 --> 47:20.905
and, bitch, all three
of my chins are jiggling.

47:20.905 --> 47:23.474
But I'm like, bitch,
I'm gonna still shut it down.

47:23.474 --> 47:25.076
- Yes, mama.

47:25.076 --> 47:27.178
[laughs]

47:27.178 --> 47:31.382
Houston, we don't
have a problem.

47:31.382 --> 47:33.617
Loosey LaDuca,

47:33.617 --> 47:35.720
have you ever ridden
a motorcycle before?

47:35.720 --> 47:37.655
- Um, I've ridden
a biker before.

47:37.655 --> 47:39.190
- OK, well, that counts.

47:39.190 --> 47:42.093
- I am ready to blow
Miss RuPaul away.

47:42.093 --> 47:43.327
You could grab tighter.
- Hold on tight.

47:43.327 --> 47:44.562
- Ooh!
- Ooh.

47:44.562 --> 47:47.498
- And, look,
they brought my biggest fan.

47:47.498 --> 47:49.300
- Oh, my goodness, Bryce,

47:49.300 --> 47:51.669
you're holding on
for dear life.

47:51.669 --> 47:54.538
Oh, you just flew
through a flock of birds.

47:54.538 --> 47:56.941
Sell me the fantasy.

47:56.941 --> 47:58.876
- [spits]
[laughter]

47:58.876 --> 48:00.077
Whoo!

48:00.077 --> 48:02.847
- Where did all these
birds come from?

48:02.847 --> 48:06.016
Where's Tippi Hedren
when you need her?

48:06.016 --> 48:09.086
Up next, we've got
the Robin Fierce.

48:09.086 --> 48:10.488
Yes, burn rubber.

48:10.488 --> 48:12.289
You look like
Melba Moore up in here.

48:12.289 --> 48:13.624
- I know how to take pictures.

48:13.624 --> 48:14.725
I know I look good.

48:14.725 --> 48:15.993
Like, it's a shoo-in.

48:17.128 --> 48:19.764
- Why those feathers
gotta be white?

48:19.764 --> 48:23.100
- Feathers, they decided
to throw feathers at me

48:23.100 --> 48:24.668
the day that I wore gloss.

48:24.668 --> 48:27.204
- [laughing]

48:27.204 --> 48:28.205
Oh, shoot.

48:28.205 --> 48:30.307
Oh, why they gotta be black?

48:32.376 --> 48:35.713
- And they all are sticking
to my lips right now.

48:35.713 --> 48:38.149
- Oh, girl,
you've got a beard now.

48:38.149 --> 48:39.316
You've got to take those off.

48:39.316 --> 48:40.851
Oh, now they red.

48:40.851 --> 48:41.952
Oh, shoot.

48:41.952 --> 48:45.156
[laughter]

48:45.156 --> 48:48.025
This must be a sign
of the apocalypse.

48:48.025 --> 48:50.995
I gotta tell you,
wig glue has really improved

48:50.995 --> 48:52.396
since season two.

48:53.831 --> 48:56.834
- Whew.
That was definitely something.

48:56.834 --> 48:59.036
[laughter]

49:00.204 --> 49:01.605
- So what did y'all think
about the twins

49:01.605 --> 49:03.207
when they first walked in?

49:03.207 --> 49:04.909
- I thought it was kind of
sickening that two people were

49:04.909 --> 49:06.243
walking in at the same time.

49:06.243 --> 49:07.978
- I gagged,
but then I wasn't gagging

49:07.978 --> 49:09.213
when I saw who it was.

49:09.213 --> 49:13.384
- And we saw that
on your face the whole time.

49:13.384 --> 49:15.619
- Well, you know, don't play
in my profession, bitch.

49:15.619 --> 49:17.955
Drag is my
bread and butter, so.

49:17.955 --> 49:19.190
- They're very sweet.

49:19.190 --> 49:21.025
- If I had to tell her
to glue down her wig

49:21.025 --> 49:24.094
for the first challenge,
it's a chop for me.

49:24.094 --> 49:25.196
- Yeah.

49:25.196 --> 49:26.363
- Right before
the photo shoot,

49:26.363 --> 49:28.232
my eyes scrolled
to the top of her head,

49:28.232 --> 49:29.900
and her lace is waving to me.

49:29.900 --> 49:31.135
I'll help her, though.

49:31.135 --> 49:32.837
I'm not going to talk shit,
but you know.

49:32.837 --> 49:34.338
- You're not going to talk shit
as you're talking shit.

49:34.338 --> 49:35.573
- You're talking
shit right now.

49:35.573 --> 49:36.974
- But I helped her, though.

49:36.974 --> 49:39.443
I fixed her wig for her,
and I helped her.

49:39.443 --> 49:42.379
With Sugar, she had no idea
what wig glue is,

49:42.379 --> 49:43.981
but I'm not really surprised,

49:43.981 --> 49:46.283
considering I'm the first
real drag queen she's met.

49:46.283 --> 49:47.885
- It's a sisterhood regardless.

49:47.885 --> 49:50.020
- No, you have
to earn my sisterhood.

49:50.020 --> 49:51.655
I don't just call
everyone my sister.

49:51.655 --> 49:53.457
It's cool to be,
like, internet queens.

49:53.457 --> 49:55.292
- Yeah.
- But maybe they'll show us

49:55.292 --> 49:56.293
that they're sickening.

49:56.293 --> 49:57.628
Seeing is believing with me.

49:57.628 --> 49:59.296
When I see it, I'll believe it.

50:00.598 --> 50:04.335
- All right,
let's pour some Sugar on it.

50:04.335 --> 50:05.803
Nice.

50:05.803 --> 50:06.904
- Other arms.

50:06.904 --> 50:09.440
- Yeah, try
that hairography on them.

50:09.440 --> 50:10.574
Oh, yeah.

50:10.574 --> 50:13.244
Honey, that motorcycle's
driving itself.

50:13.244 --> 50:14.245
Oh, no, it's snow.

50:14.245 --> 50:15.346
- [gags]

50:15.346 --> 50:16.347
- Don't spit.

50:16.347 --> 50:17.615
Just swallow it.

50:19.216 --> 50:20.217
Ooh.

50:20.217 --> 50:22.386
Are you having a seizure?

50:22.386 --> 50:23.387
OK.

50:23.387 --> 50:25.222
Oh, my goodness.

50:25.222 --> 50:27.091
- I'm trying to stick
to my modeling rules

50:27.091 --> 50:28.893
of suck in the gut,
stick out the butt,

50:28.893 --> 50:30.160
and tighten that tuck.

50:30.160 --> 50:31.962
This look is based
on the first ever

50:31.962 --> 50:33.397
Bratz doll I had.

50:33.397 --> 50:34.498
Sugar and Spice, our names,

50:34.498 --> 50:36.533
literally come
from these dolls.

50:36.533 --> 50:40.537
- I heard Bryce has dandruff,
but this is outrageous.

50:40.537 --> 50:42.606
- Well, that was a wild ride.

50:42.606 --> 50:44.675
Is the wig still on?

50:44.675 --> 50:45.943
- Well, we've had Sugar.

50:45.943 --> 50:48.612
Let's have a little bit
of Spice.

50:48.612 --> 50:49.713
- Hello.

50:49.713 --> 50:51.048
I'm a little scared
because I'm like,

50:51.048 --> 50:52.917
I didn't really
pin this wig in that well.

50:52.917 --> 50:55.786
But a drag princess
always comes prepared.

50:59.423 --> 51:01.191
I got my little shower cap.

51:01.191 --> 51:03.093
- Oh, interesting.
- Yeah.

51:03.093 --> 51:05.529
You know, Spice always has
to be a little different.

51:05.529 --> 51:07.364
And you can't go wrong
with a shower cap.

51:07.364 --> 51:08.732
Do we like?
Are we living?

51:08.732 --> 51:11.802
- So you want to do hairography
with a shower cap?

51:11.802 --> 51:14.438
- Of course.
- That's an interesting choice.

51:14.438 --> 51:15.539
- But you know,
I feel like the shower cap,

51:15.539 --> 51:17.875
it's cute,
it adds a little drama,

51:17.875 --> 51:18.943
a little variety.

51:18.943 --> 51:20.711
- You can imagine how gorgeous

51:20.711 --> 51:23.580
your hair would look
with the fan blowing, right?

51:23.580 --> 51:25.115
But you want
to wear a shower cap.

51:25.115 --> 51:26.784
- Absolutely.
- And that's your choice,

51:26.784 --> 51:28.085
so let's do it.

51:28.085 --> 51:29.987
- I've been ready
for this my whole life.

51:29.987 --> 51:32.623
Like, this is the moment
I have been waiting for.

51:32.623 --> 51:33.958
It's kind of like my mini

51:33.958 --> 51:35.059
"America's Next Top Model"
moment.

51:35.059 --> 51:36.927
- Work that shower cap, girl.

51:36.927 --> 51:39.697
[laughing]

51:39.697 --> 51:42.166
Oh, is it springtime already?

51:42.166 --> 51:43.701
Oh, it's a change of seasons.

51:43.701 --> 51:45.002
Don't you love the fall?

51:45.002 --> 51:46.270
- I love the fall.

51:47.271 --> 51:48.572
- Oh, my goodness.

51:50.474 --> 51:53.043
So you certainly are
Sugar's sister.

51:53.043 --> 51:54.712
[laughing]

51:54.712 --> 51:57.181
Climate change is a problem.

51:57.181 --> 51:59.516
I believe in science.

52:01.652 --> 52:04.054
Whose idea was this?

52:04.054 --> 52:05.456
[upbeat music]

52:05.456 --> 52:07.324
- Hello.

52:07.324 --> 52:08.792
- Oh.
- Y'all like my new look?

52:08.792 --> 52:10.427
- What happened
to your wig, girl?

52:10.427 --> 52:12.396
- Oh, her wig flew.

52:13.397 --> 52:15.332
- Spice is coming back in
after her photo shoot

52:15.332 --> 52:17.634
looking like Donald
fucking Duck with that hat on.

52:17.634 --> 52:20.738
- Oh, my God.
- Bitch, you look crazy.

52:22.006 --> 52:24.508
- Y'all look so different
out of drag. Whoa.

52:24.508 --> 52:26.143
I can't recognize
half of these girls.

52:26.143 --> 52:29.279
I'm like, who is this
tattooed man in the corner?

52:29.279 --> 52:30.381
I'm like, oh, that's Loosey.

52:30.381 --> 52:32.249
The tattoos,
I did not expect that

52:32.249 --> 52:34.251
from your blonde persona.
- I know, I know.

52:34.251 --> 52:36.020
Yeah, it's, like,
super different, night and day.

52:36.020 --> 52:37.755
- Now I'm seeing
the construction worker.

52:37.755 --> 52:38.822
- Yeah. [laughs]

52:38.822 --> 52:40.124
- Oh, my God,
wow, you look so--

52:40.124 --> 52:41.425
- [gasps] What?

52:41.425 --> 52:42.626
- Because I think you were,
like, blonde.

52:42.626 --> 52:44.461
Wow. Is that all
your natural hair too?

52:44.461 --> 52:45.796
- Mm-hmm.

52:45.796 --> 52:48.699
- Mistress is the biggest
transformation.

52:48.699 --> 52:51.502
She goes from this glamorous
Houston drag queen

52:51.502 --> 52:53.170
to the owner of a pizzeria.

52:54.405 --> 52:55.706
That was so mean.

52:55.706 --> 52:56.974
[laughs]

52:58.075 --> 53:00.444
- Listen, before y'all
got here, I was, like,

53:00.444 --> 53:02.780
I'm curious to see what
the twins are going to bring

53:02.780 --> 53:04.181
because a lot
of people audition

53:04.181 --> 53:05.749
year after year after year.

53:05.749 --> 53:08.018
So for y'all to come through,
I feel like,

53:08.018 --> 53:10.421
bitch, y'all better impress.

53:10.421 --> 53:11.889
So I mean--
- Right, I'm excited.

53:11.889 --> 53:13.624
- Yeah, I'm excited to see
what y'all bring to the table.

53:13.624 --> 53:14.892
- It's going to be interesting
for sure, yeah.

53:14.892 --> 53:19.263
Mistress is definitely
eyeing me and Sugar down.

53:19.263 --> 53:20.764
She's trying to get
into the gig,

53:20.764 --> 53:22.433
and she's collecting her data.

53:22.433 --> 53:24.068
- Like, it's very different
for me to be around

53:24.068 --> 53:25.803
people this young,
even though I'm young.

53:25.803 --> 53:27.604
No, really, like, in Houston,

53:27.604 --> 53:29.573
most of our established
queens are much older.

53:29.573 --> 53:31.742
We work with drag legends
on the regular shows.

53:31.742 --> 53:33.010
Like, we work with,
like, Tommie Ross,

53:33.010 --> 53:34.511
Chevelle Brooks,
like, big names.

53:34.511 --> 53:36.113
So I mean,
I respect the older queens.

53:36.113 --> 53:38.449
I love my drag legends,
especially in Texas.

53:41.251 --> 53:43.120
- Wait, if everyone had
to describe themselves

53:43.120 --> 53:45.122
like, in one adjective,
what would it be?

53:45.122 --> 53:46.123
Because for me--
- Bitch, what is this,

53:46.123 --> 53:47.291
icebreakers in seventh grade?

53:47.291 --> 53:49.093
- No, because you said
I was goofy.

53:49.093 --> 53:51.628
And the other day, like,
I was talking to myself,

53:51.628 --> 53:53.263
you know, as we do.

53:53.263 --> 53:56.567
And I was like,
oh, my God, I'm goofy.

53:56.567 --> 53:58.836
I've realized, like, I just--
like, words come out,

53:58.836 --> 54:01.939
and then after, I kind of,
like, put them together.

54:01.939 --> 54:03.040
You know, like,
I don't really know what--

54:03.040 --> 54:04.174
it's just, like,
after the fact,

54:04.174 --> 54:06.076
and I'm like, OK,
that makes a sentence.

54:06.076 --> 54:08.011
- Sugar and Spice are a lot.

54:08.011 --> 54:11.348
We are like, damn, they are
the same in and out of drag.

54:11.348 --> 54:13.150
It just won't stop.
Won't it?

54:13.150 --> 54:14.318
- I feel like
everyone's either, like,

54:14.318 --> 54:16.153
a bike ride person
or a porch person.

54:16.153 --> 54:18.088
Like, you're either one.
- Not a porch person.

54:18.088 --> 54:19.256
- I'm both.

54:19.256 --> 54:20.257
- When me and Sugar start

54:20.257 --> 54:21.792
getting into our
own little world.

54:21.792 --> 54:23.494
And I'm like, OK, oh,
we're talking over each other.

54:23.494 --> 54:25.129
[spluttering]
It's like word vomit.

54:25.129 --> 54:26.463
- But, like, we would
always go on bike rides.

54:26.463 --> 54:28.332
- We had magical bike rides.

54:28.332 --> 54:29.333
- [barely audible] Magical.

54:29.333 --> 54:30.667
- I think some of the girls

54:30.667 --> 54:32.503
still feel annoyed
by Sugar and Spice.

54:32.503 --> 54:33.537
- We had just came out,
and I was like,

54:33.537 --> 54:34.838
we're getting all of our dolls.

54:34.838 --> 54:37.007
- But I'm starting
to warm up to them.

54:37.007 --> 54:39.009
Sugar and Spice are
a fucking hoot.

54:39.009 --> 54:40.177
- I think we move on
from that one.

54:40.177 --> 54:41.578
- OK.
[laughter]

54:41.578 --> 54:43.413
- Don't leave us
to our own devices.

54:43.413 --> 54:44.481
- Y'all are getting distracted

54:44.481 --> 54:45.549
because y'all are making
no sense at all.

54:45.549 --> 54:46.583
- I know.

54:47.784 --> 54:49.820
- Well, look what
the wind blew in.

54:49.820 --> 54:52.689
[all screaming]

54:52.689 --> 54:54.658
- Ooh, I'm not running, bitch.
I'm gonna tiptoe.

54:56.593 --> 55:02.900
- Ladykins, the winner
of today's mini challenge is...

55:02.900 --> 55:03.901
Loosey LaDuca.

55:03.901 --> 55:07.137
- [shrieks]
[all cheering]

55:07.137 --> 55:08.438
It's me!

55:08.438 --> 55:09.439
I won.

55:09.439 --> 55:11.475
I won the very first challenge.

55:11.475 --> 55:15.078
- You've won a cash prize
of $2,500.

55:15.078 --> 55:16.280
- Ooh, OK.

55:16.280 --> 55:18.115
I want to win everything.

55:18.115 --> 55:20.117
I want to be
the first one in history

55:20.117 --> 55:23.954
to win every mini challenge
and every maxi challenge.

55:23.954 --> 55:27.824
- My queens, now it's time
to get things rolling.

55:27.824 --> 55:30.694
For your very first
maxi challenge,

55:30.694 --> 55:34.164
you'll be performing
in a talent extravaganza

55:34.164 --> 55:36.300
we're calling "One Night Only."

55:36.300 --> 55:38.268
[glamorous orchestral sting]

55:38.268 --> 55:39.670
- ♪ One Night Only ♪

55:39.670 --> 55:42.439
[laughter]

55:42.439 --> 55:45.475
- In addition to showcasing
your individual talents,

55:45.475 --> 55:48.545
you need to choreograph
a group number

55:48.545 --> 55:51.582
for your big, juicy opening.

55:51.582 --> 55:55.118
And in a moment, you'll head
to the rehearsal studio

55:55.118 --> 55:56.687
to get started.

55:56.687 --> 55:58.455
Racers, start your engines,

55:58.455 --> 56:01.558
and may the best
drag queen win.

56:01.558 --> 56:04.628
- I'm very excited because
I finally get to see

56:04.628 --> 56:07.030
what the girls
are going to bring.

56:07.030 --> 56:08.031
- Whoo!
- Ah!

56:08.031 --> 56:09.566
- Yay, away.

56:09.566 --> 56:11.268
Now you have to put your money
where your mouth is

56:11.268 --> 56:15.239
and do what you do and just
show the world and impress.

56:17.708 --> 56:20.310
- Meanwhile, back
with our unsuspecting queens

56:20.310 --> 56:22.212
on the rehearsal stage,

56:22.212 --> 56:25.282
y'all ready for some
premiere drama, mama?

56:25.282 --> 56:27.017
- I think we should
all have a moment like--

56:27.017 --> 56:28.585
♪ Am I the greatest star? ♪

56:28.585 --> 56:30.554
♪ Or am I full of baloney? ♪

56:30.554 --> 56:31.755
- Cute.

56:31.755 --> 56:33.190
The fact that we have
to do choreography

56:33.190 --> 56:36.026
for our first challenge
is a little bit nerve-racking,

56:36.026 --> 56:37.861
but I'm starting to feel
like we're actually

56:37.861 --> 56:39.930
going to impress the judges
with this stuff.

56:39.930 --> 56:41.398
- Five, six, seven, eight.

56:41.398 --> 56:42.966
- ♪ Tonight, tonight ♪

56:42.966 --> 56:45.235
♪ One night only ♪

56:46.236 --> 56:47.838

- Oh, my God.

56:49.673 --> 56:52.442
- Oh, my God.
It's RuPaul.

56:52.442 --> 56:54.578
Why is RuPaul here?

56:54.578 --> 56:56.013
- Hi, ladykins.

56:56.013 --> 56:57.214
all: Hi.

56:57.214 --> 56:58.582
- Ru, not now, don't.

56:58.582 --> 57:00.517
Just let me get
the choreography first

57:00.517 --> 57:03.387
before you start throwing
spins and turns on me.

57:03.387 --> 57:04.721
[dramatic music]

57:04.721 --> 57:06.857
- Do you know what would
make your big opening

57:06.857 --> 57:10.127
even more irresistible?

57:10.127 --> 57:11.862
Mmm, take it from me.

57:11.862 --> 57:14.331
I know my way around
some big openings.

57:14.331 --> 57:16.833
[laughter]

57:16.833 --> 57:19.369
Eight more dancers.

57:19.369 --> 57:21.238
[laughter]

57:21.238 --> 57:24.074
Isn't that a great idea?

57:24.074 --> 57:25.809
Send in the clowns, Chaz.

57:25.809 --> 57:28.712
♪ ♪

57:28.712 --> 57:32.182

57:32.182 --> 57:34.584
- OK.
- Queens of season 15,

57:34.584 --> 57:36.853
meet the queens of season 15.

57:36.853 --> 57:38.588
- Oh, my God.

57:38.588 --> 57:40.390
- I did not expect this
to happen right now.

57:40.390 --> 57:42.693
I was fully focused
on this rehearsal,

57:42.693 --> 57:44.695
and there they are.

57:44.695 --> 57:47.497
- Oh, not this.

57:48.965 --> 57:50.500
- I'm not impressed.

57:50.500 --> 57:52.369
[laughs]

57:52.369 --> 57:53.537
- It's like a showdown.

58:07.084 --> 58:09.586
of America's Next
Drag Superstar,

58:09.586 --> 58:12.622
and the competition
kicks off tomorrow

58:12.622 --> 58:17.694

58:17.694 --> 58:21.431
16 individual performances.

58:22.799 --> 58:26.069
But before this week is over,

one of you will be going home,

58:31.141 --> 58:32.342
for reals.

58:32.342 --> 58:34.378
- Uh-uh.
- Wow.

58:34.378 --> 58:35.379
- Ah.

58:36.646 --> 58:38.382

58:38.382 --> 58:40.016
where no one went home
for weeks.

58:40.016 --> 58:42.085
Like, we are cutting
to the point right away.

58:42.085 --> 58:44.154
Like, someone is getting
the chop.

58:44.154 --> 58:46.790
- I can already tell there
are some divas over there

58:46.790 --> 58:49.192
who are here to play.

58:49.192 --> 58:52.129
How am I going to stand out
amongst all these girls?

58:52.129 --> 58:54.765
- We can't even choreograph
this number with eight people.

58:54.765 --> 58:56.566
16?

58:56.566 --> 58:58.135
- You ever hear the old joke

58:58.135 --> 59:00.637
of 16 drag queens walk
into a bar?

59:02.606 --> 59:05.409
I haven't either, but I don't
think it ends very well.

59:11.081 --> 59:12.816
- Next time
on "RuPaul's Drag Race"...

59:12.816 --> 59:15.051
