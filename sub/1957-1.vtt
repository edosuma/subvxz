00:57.292 --> 01:00.251
MONDAY

01:42.292 --> 01:44.251
We haven't got much time.

01:44.959 --> 01:46.876
Take off your clothes, Slatan.

02:12.042 --> 02:13.126
They're both ready.

02:15.251 --> 02:18.626
But tomorrow, only one will go.

02:20.751 --> 02:22.417
It's your decision.

02:22.626 --> 02:23.376
I'll go.

02:23.667 --> 02:24.667
I'll go.

02:26.626 --> 02:28.417
Let luck decide.

02:31.209 --> 02:32.251
Got a coin?

02:38.834 --> 02:40.042
And you?

02:43.917 --> 02:45.626
Should I go for change?

02:46.292 --> 02:47.584
There's a supermarket.

02:47.709 --> 02:48.959
No. How about you?

02:49.126 --> 02:51.126
I haven't got anything.

02:51.292 --> 02:52.876
I found one.

02:55.209 --> 02:55.876
Heads,

02:56.459 --> 02:57.584
tails.

03:04.709 --> 03:05.792
Slatan,

03:06.626 --> 03:07.792
you win.

03:11.751 --> 03:14.209
TUESDAY

03:15.709 --> 03:17.834
Move slowly.

03:19.542 --> 03:21.459
Act sure of yourself.

03:23.626 --> 03:25.209
Make eye contact.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.167
What if something goes wrong?

03:31.626 --> 03:32.626
Wrong?

03:37.292 --> 03:38.501
What is your name?

03:39.001 --> 03:40.626
My name is Slatan Sveraev.

03:41.417 --> 03:42.834
Where are you traveling to?

03:43.042 --> 03:44.334
Spain.

03:44.709 --> 03:46.501
- Why?
- Work.

03:46.626 --> 03:49.084
Alicante, pharmaceutical.

03:52.251 --> 03:55.209
The jacket you're wearing
has nothing metal.

03:58.626 --> 04:02.667
The scanner won't detect
the explosives.

04:06.042 --> 04:08.042
Nothing will go wrong.

04:14.251 --> 04:16.375
Are you carrying anything metal?

04:17.125 --> 04:21.041
Oh, right.
It must be my wedding ring.

04:27.251 --> 04:28.667
Remove your shoes.

04:28.834 --> 04:30.251
What could I be carrying
in my shoes?

04:30.417 --> 04:32.042
A machine gun? Plutonium?

04:32.209 --> 04:34.001
What are you afraid of?

04:34.834 --> 04:36.626
You must not be searched.

04:37.126 --> 04:38.917
They cannot touch you.

04:39.542 --> 04:42.751
What's wrong with you people?
This is disrespectful.

04:43.167 --> 04:44.626
Why are you touching me?

04:47.667 --> 04:49.626
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

04:50.626 --> 04:52.542
You'll detonate the bomb
during takeoff.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.459
Over the urban area.

04:54.751 --> 04:58.251
With 90,000 liters of kerosene
in the tanks.

05:03.167 --> 05:05.084
The metal components
of the detonator

05:05.959 --> 05:08.001
will be hidden
in your personal objects.

05:16.542 --> 05:20.167
There are two ways
to detonate the bomb.

05:22.792 --> 05:26.626
The cord on your chest
detonates the bomb in your jacket.

05:27.584 --> 05:30.126
If you're discovered,

05:30.292 --> 05:32.459
push the auxiliary button.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.542
The bomb will explode
after four minutes.

05:36.667 --> 05:39.542
Right when the cops
are all over you.

05:40.084 --> 05:42.917
They will never take you alive.

05:48.834 --> 05:52.376
The mix of explosives
is very sensitive.

05:56.917 --> 05:59.376
Humidity makes it unstable.

06:02.084 --> 06:03.292
Do not drink.

06:03.959 --> 06:05.417
Do not sweat.

06:07.876 --> 06:10.292
If it gets wet, it will explode.

06:12.917 --> 06:15.126
Act like a normal passenger.

06:17.792 --> 06:19.001
Be friendly.

06:20.126 --> 06:20.917
Alex!

06:21.251 --> 06:22.334
Don't be a nuisance.

06:22.584 --> 06:23.501
Sit down.

06:26.126 --> 06:28.084
For years you've lived

06:28.292 --> 06:29.876
hidden like a dog

06:30.501 --> 06:31.709
in Alicante.

06:34.876 --> 06:35.917
Do you speak Spanish?

06:36.209 --> 06:37.417
A little bit.

06:37.834 --> 06:41.042
He's not completely deaf.
He has 6% hearing.

06:42.251 --> 06:44.417
He had an accident at home.

06:44.626 --> 06:46.459
They can operate when he's older.

06:46.626 --> 06:47.542
Women...

06:48.209 --> 06:50.626
will embroider your face
on clothing.

06:53.542 --> 06:54.501
Children...

06:54.751 --> 06:58.584
will learn your name at school.
Slatan.

07:02.292 --> 07:06.292
All of Karadjistan is with you...

07:06.709 --> 07:08.376
Where's your luggage, Sasha?

07:08.542 --> 07:11.751
We agreed that if I didn't relapse,
we were going to Spain today.

07:11.917 --> 07:15.626
Your sacrifice
is the greatest act of love.

07:15.876 --> 07:17.917
If I'm nuts, don't come with me.

07:18.126 --> 07:20.126
Stay in this shitty city.

07:20.417 --> 07:22.001
It smells like a hospital!

07:22.376 --> 07:25.001
If I'm nuts,
you shouldn't be with me!

07:25.167 --> 07:27.251
- You're not well.
- Of course I'm not.

07:27.501 --> 07:29.292
- I'm not going.
- Wait...

07:29.501 --> 07:30.626
It's your time, Slatan.

07:32.792 --> 07:34.584
You'll be a hero.

07:34.751 --> 07:37.459
Sasha, please...
Give me another chance.

07:37.792 --> 07:39.459
Please, don't leave me.

07:39.626 --> 07:42.417
I'll kill myself.
I swear I will.

07:43.209 --> 07:45.751
People will never forget you.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.834
You're going to die for our people.

08:06.751 --> 08:10.584
Russia has offended our honor...

08:11.251 --> 08:15.001
...murdered our hope.

08:16.376 --> 08:19.667
100 years of oppression are enough.

08:19.834 --> 08:23.084
We will not hang our heads.

08:23.709 --> 08:27.834
We will not forgive their insults.

08:28.001 --> 08:31.792
We will never forget our fallen.

08:31.959 --> 08:35.708
100 years of oppression are enough.

08:36.292 --> 08:39.417
All of our enemies will die.

08:40.083 --> 08:41.667
They will die.

08:42.958 --> 08:44.876
They will die!

08:46.001 --> 08:47.709
Excuse me. Thank you.

08:51.167 --> 08:52.251
Excuse me.

08:52.667 --> 08:55.626
The Chinese make everything
their size.

08:58.626 --> 08:59.626
Let's see...

08:59.917 --> 09:01.084
Here we are.

09:10.209 --> 09:11.334
Pardon me.

09:11.667 --> 09:15.501
I just married this pretty
little mouse sitting beside you

09:15.626 --> 09:17.292
and they gave us separate seats.

09:17.501 --> 09:19.959
Would you mind sitting here
in my seat?

09:20.126 --> 09:21.751
I'll change seats.

09:21.959 --> 09:24.001
- Really? You don't mind?
- Not at all.

09:24.167 --> 09:25.626
Thank you.

09:32.292 --> 09:34.667
Do you speak Castilian?
Spanish, do you speak Spanish?

09:34.834 --> 09:35.626
A little.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.417
I saw you in Customs...

09:37.584 --> 09:40.417
They checked everything
but my rectum. They're psychotic

09:40.584 --> 09:42.001
about terrorism, Jesus.

09:42.167 --> 09:43.084
It's crazy.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.209
Hold on.

09:47.001 --> 09:48.042
The seatbelt.

09:50.584 --> 09:51.792
Where's the...?

09:52.417 --> 09:53.626
Wait...

09:54.084 --> 09:55.751
Oh, that's yours.

09:55.917 --> 09:56.667
You're right.

09:56.917 --> 09:58.376
Good lord.

09:58.751 --> 09:59.876
My God.

10:00.209 --> 10:01.417
Geez, it's hot.

10:03.042 --> 10:05.209
"What to do in case of an accident."

10:05.417 --> 10:07.292
Preparing us for the worst.

10:08.167 --> 10:11.584
The wings on Russian planes
are stapled on.

10:12.209 --> 10:15.542
Never fails.
Accident, Russian plane...

10:19.709 --> 10:22.126
Two anti-anxiety pills
and a prayer...

10:23.084 --> 10:24.667
and we'll be in Madrid.

10:24.834 --> 10:27.626
I'm Eugenio Sanardy.
Eugene.

10:28.626 --> 10:30.001
Slatan Sveraev.

10:30.167 --> 10:31.084
Nice to meet you.
Russian?

10:32.042 --> 10:33.917
Sorry, they spilled...

10:34.167 --> 10:35.167
- There.
- Yes.

10:35.501 --> 10:36.459
All set.

10:37.084 --> 10:38.042
Thanks.

10:38.209 --> 10:40.126
We're going to spend
more than 6 hours together.

10:41.042 --> 10:43.667
A lot of marriages
don't last that long.

10:44.001 --> 10:46.584
- Oh, newlyweds. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

10:46.709 --> 10:48.876
- Honeymoon in the Caribbean.
- Yeah?

10:49.042 --> 10:50.376
Who could ask for more?

10:50.542 --> 10:52.584
After two years living in Moscow.

10:52.709 --> 10:55.959
- Hooray for the newlyweds.
- Hooray.

11:12.334 --> 11:13.459
What's wrong?

11:13.792 --> 11:15.751
What's going on?
I told you.

11:16.084 --> 11:18.792
Russian plane.
Something defective.

11:21.959 --> 11:22.667
Technical problem?

11:22.834 --> 11:24.542
It smells like gasoline.

11:44.459 --> 11:45.626
Your attention, please.

11:47.501 --> 11:50.626
The flight has been cancelled
due to the storm.

11:54.459 --> 11:57.959
The passengers who need lodging
will be taken to a hotel.

11:58.292 --> 12:00.417
But due to the number
of cancellations,

12:00.584 --> 12:03.459
it's possible
the hotel will be out of town.

13:07.584 --> 13:09.251
What time will the plane leave
tomorrow?

13:09.626 --> 13:12.792
We'll pick you up at ten, sir.
Have your luggage ready.

13:14.417 --> 13:16.167
Enjoy your stay.

13:50.126 --> 13:51.917
Damn Russian music.

14:40.834 --> 14:44.459
I can't believe it!
What are you doing here?

14:44.834 --> 14:46.667
-It's a mistake.
- My room.

14:46.876 --> 14:47.792
No, my room!

14:47.959 --> 14:50.626
Okay, it'll be our room.

14:51.417 --> 14:55.292
Seated together, sharing a room...
It's destiny.

14:55.876 --> 14:58.001
- How about that!
- How about what?

14:58.167 --> 15:00.626
No, I mean...
What's your trade, pal?

15:00.834 --> 15:02.667
Your job.
What do you do?

15:03.001 --> 15:04.459
I sell medicine.

15:04.626 --> 15:06.751
We're practically colleagues.

15:06.917 --> 15:08.626
I sell shoes.

15:09.459 --> 15:12.167
Nothing like a good shoe
for a healthy body.

15:15.292 --> 15:16.209
Look.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.417
Check these out.

15:19.042 --> 15:21.709
Not bad, huh? Ladies shoes.
You know why?

15:23.001 --> 15:24.626
Know what my slogan is?

15:24.792 --> 15:26.876
So comfortable
even a man can wear them.

15:27.084 --> 15:29.459
No blisters,
never a damn chilblain.

15:29.876 --> 15:32.209
Sanardy Shoes change your life.

15:33.709 --> 15:35.584
I have some with me, look.

15:36.667 --> 15:37.626
Yeah, springs.

15:37.876 --> 15:39.751
Russian hotels still don't use
bed frames.

15:39.959 --> 15:42.084
Like sleeping in a bird cage.

15:42.876 --> 15:44.042
Don't move.

15:45.126 --> 15:46.251
Why not?

15:46.501 --> 15:47.959
Because... my bed.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.834
0K8)'-

15:53.542 --> 15:55.126
I'm going to the can.

16:35.376 --> 16:37.876
Hi, it's Slatan.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.209
I'm in a hotel.

16:39.376 --> 16:42.292
Are you crazy?
They'll trace the call!

16:42.459 --> 16:44.292
Hang up, you idiot!
Hang up!

16:44.584 --> 16:45.709
Hang up! Hang UP!

16:51.792 --> 16:53.834
WEDNESDAY

17:04.126 --> 17:04.791
Hi.

17:05.251 --> 17:06.416
Hi.

17:08.626 --> 17:10.959
I need some razors.

17:12.041 --> 17:13.626
- Razors?
- Yeah.

17:14.041 --> 17:18.876
The storm caught me off guard...
and I want to shave my legs.

17:20.041 --> 17:21.751
Shave. One moment.

17:24.251 --> 17:25.334
Razors.

17:26.001 --> 17:27.626
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

17:29.292 --> 17:30.167
Excuse me.

17:30.709 --> 17:31.709
Excuse me.

17:33.209 --> 17:34.084
Good morning.

17:37.792 --> 17:40.001
When are they taking us
to the airport?

17:40.417 --> 17:42.376
It probably won't be today.

17:43.126 --> 17:45.084
The forecast is snow, snow...

17:45.251 --> 17:46.792
and more snow!

17:51.126 --> 17:52.292
0K8)'-

17:52.667 --> 17:56.501
I'd like to change rooms,
to a single.

17:56.667 --> 17:58.667
All the rooms are shared.

17:58.834 --> 18:02.042
This is a small hotel. It isn't
prepared for so many guests.

18:02.626 --> 18:03.542
I'm sorry.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.042
Good morning!

18:13.709 --> 18:16.042
Any problems with the snow
last night?

19:21.334 --> 19:23.042
Please try to understand.

19:23.209 --> 19:24.042
Ruskie!

19:24.209 --> 19:25.292
Come here.

19:25.501 --> 19:26.834
You can sit by me.

19:27.001 --> 19:28.917
Come on.
He didn't hear me.

19:29.167 --> 19:31.376
There's no oatmeal?
A kiwi?

19:31.876 --> 19:32.751
Something healthy.

19:34.376 --> 19:36.834
What do you mean, I can't cancel?
<i>7</i> thousand euros!

19:37.042 --> 19:38.167
- Sorry...
- No, no...

19:38.584 --> 19:39.834
Please, ladies first.

19:40.001 --> 19:41.459
- Thank you.
- Miss, are you lame?

19:41.667 --> 19:44.126
I'm trapped in Russia.
Russia!

19:44.417 --> 19:46.501
How should I know what time
I'm getting to Puerto Vallarta?

19:46.626 --> 19:48.501
Say you'll be there
at a quarter to.

19:48.626 --> 19:50.251
Have them put some champagne
on ice.

19:50.417 --> 19:52.334
Like hell I'm going to pay
the honeymoon suite.

19:52.501 --> 19:55.334
I am being polite,
just don't fuck with me.

19:55.501 --> 19:57.376
It's my honeymoon!
Once in a lifetime!

19:57.751 --> 19:59.751
I won't send shit in writing!

20:00.209 --> 20:01.001
Pinhead!

20:01.709 --> 20:02.626
Thief!

20:04.167 --> 20:05.084
You're corrupt!

20:10.876 --> 20:13.001
I'm sorry, I can't talk right now.

20:13.251 --> 20:15.126
I don't know what's happening.

20:16.084 --> 20:17.584
I can't stop laughing!

20:18.334 --> 20:19.584
Finished?

20:20.084 --> 20:22.542
What's a lady with such
a great sense of humor

20:22.667 --> 20:24.626
doing in the Russian steppe?

20:24.792 --> 20:26.459
I was at a funeral.

20:28.126 --> 20:29.417
My husband's.

20:32.334 --> 20:33.459
Mmm, tasty.

20:34.376 --> 20:35.292
Hi.

20:35.542 --> 20:36.584
Hi.

20:36.751 --> 20:38.626
What happened to your wrist?

20:40.917 --> 20:41.584
Nothing.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.917
I cut myself on a bottle
of perfume.

20:45.126 --> 20:46.584
Clumsy me!

20:47.001 --> 20:49.167
Here we are,
the whole Spanish colony.

20:49.334 --> 20:50.376
And it looks like
for a while.

20:50.584 --> 20:54.084
We should do something tonight
for entertainment.

20:54.334 --> 20:55.251
Alex!

20:55.417 --> 20:58.209
Karaoke? Getting laid is pretty
unlikely.

20:58.459 --> 21:00.334
Maestro, you play the piano,
right?

21:00.626 --> 21:03.417
I've called the company
85 times already.

21:03.584 --> 21:06.542
I talked to a machine that...

21:08.334 --> 21:10.292
Camilo, what's your problem?

21:10.542 --> 21:13.126
- Sorry, my love.
- You think this is normal?

21:13.292 --> 21:14.584
Have you seen my son?

21:15.584 --> 21:16.751
Always the same.

21:17.001 --> 21:18.959
I turn around and he takes off.

21:21.167 --> 21:22.209
Alex!

21:29.126 --> 21:31.042
He was playing in the snow.

21:31.209 --> 21:32.876
Hold him for a second, okay?

21:36.251 --> 21:37.209
Wait...!

22:15.167 --> 22:16.542
That was you

22:16.792 --> 22:19.626
outside the door
in the bathroom, right?

22:22.292 --> 22:24.042
It wasn't a bottle of perfume.

22:28.584 --> 22:29.667
You know what?

22:36.417 --> 22:38.626
If you really want to cut vein,

22:40.542 --> 22:42.251
you have to cut vertical.

22:45.376 --> 22:46.542
And zigzag.

22:48.001 --> 22:50.167
So they can't stitch.

22:54.126 --> 22:56.251
Then you get in bathtub
with hot water.

22:59.126 --> 23:00.751
There you can go...

23:01.709 --> 23:03.167
very peacefully.

23:06.751 --> 23:07.667
0K8)'-

23:10.709 --> 23:12.542
Can you watch baby?

23:14.709 --> 23:15.417
Yes.

23:30.251 --> 23:31.667
Get out of here.

23:32.209 --> 23:33.209
Out!

24:24.917 --> 24:27.167
Knowing that I loved you,

24:27.376 --> 24:31.084
that you were my joy
and my blazing dream.

24:33.834 --> 24:35.792
It's too late to comfort me.

24:36.001 --> 24:38.501
That's why I get drunk

24:41.667 --> 24:44.209
to forget

24:44.626 --> 24:46.417
your love.

24:48.667 --> 24:49.834
Bravo!

24:52.084 --> 24:53.042
What's going on?

24:53.209 --> 24:54.251
Karaoke night.

24:54.417 --> 24:55.626
Who wants to try?

24:56.042 --> 24:58.751
Come on, my shoes are full of swing.

25:01.251 --> 25:02.501
That's it!

25:03.251 --> 25:04.626
Ruskie! How about it?

25:04.959 --> 25:05.917
Sing us something.

25:06.251 --> 25:07.584
We're in your land.

25:07.751 --> 25:09.751
Sing something
from Mother Russia.

25:09.959 --> 25:11.626
You want a little help?

25:11.792 --> 25:12.667
Maestro?

25:12.876 --> 25:13.876
Hit it.

26:30.334 --> 26:31.584
Ravil!

26:35.834 --> 26:39.584
The storm has intensified
with a low pressure polar front.

26:39.709 --> 26:42.876
In the next 48 hours';
we expect lows of -32C

26:43.584 --> 26:47.626
along with strong winds
and heavy snow.

26:56.751 --> 26:57.959
Oh, good.

26:58.542 --> 27:00.126
There's a little left.

27:00.876 --> 27:02.334
Bring it over.

27:02.834 --> 27:05.001
Keep the party going.

27:06.834 --> 27:10.376
Lola, if you want to go to bed,
that's okay.

27:10.542 --> 27:13.501
What? I have a babysitter for once.

27:13.751 --> 27:15.709
I left them with the Argentinean.

27:15.917 --> 27:19.126
He'll dance them right to sleep!

27:23.709 --> 27:27.417
Tell me, sweetie...
What brought you to Russia?

27:36.584 --> 27:37.959
Want me to show you?

27:56.876 --> 27:58.959
Where is there a telephone?

27:59.584 --> 28:00.751
Here.

28:05.542 --> 28:06.542
No...

28:07.001 --> 28:10.834
ls there a public telephone
anywhere around here?

28:12.459 --> 28:17.292
I feel like going for a walk
to get the blood flowing.

28:18.251 --> 28:21.376
It's 30 degrees below zero outside

28:22.251 --> 28:24.626
and the nearest village

28:24.959 --> 28:27.584
is 9 kilometers to the north.

28:28.626 --> 28:29.584
To the north.

28:31.667 --> 28:32.417
Thanks.

29:02.959 --> 29:05.626
- You looked beautiful.
- There we are.

29:05.792 --> 29:08.001
Six months after meeting
in Torrevieja.

29:09.917 --> 29:13.917
“Listen to me, Dolores.
Do you find me attractive?

29:15.042 --> 29:15.917
Well, honey?“

29:16.334 --> 29:18.834
He should try a little sun block!

29:19.001 --> 29:21.209
His face looks like
a monkey's ass!

29:21.376 --> 29:24.501
"It's not the sun,
I'm red from the vodka.

29:24.667 --> 29:26.334
From the liquor.

29:26.501 --> 29:28.001
From the brandy.

29:28.417 --> 29:29.667
From drinking anything."

29:30.001 --> 29:33.167
Go on, put your tie
on your head, Boris.

29:33.417 --> 29:34.459
Look, look!

29:37.042 --> 29:38.501
"This is as calm

29:38.667 --> 29:42.584
as you'll see me
in the next 8 years.

29:43.459 --> 29:46.834
Everyone listen to me.
The Spanish girl married a Russian.

29:47.001 --> 29:48.959
And she thinks
that because I'm old

29:49.126 --> 29:51.126
I'll treat her with respect
and dignity.

29:51.584 --> 29:52.834
Well, I won't.

29:53.584 --> 29:55.001
I will leave her

29:55.167 --> 29:56.292
with two children.

29:56.501 --> 29:59.251
Without a single orgasm,

29:59.417 --> 30:03.126
not a penny to her name
and with marks on her body.

30:03.501 --> 30:06.126
With this open hand

30:06.292 --> 30:08.751
I'll beat her for 8 years,

30:08.917 --> 30:10.626
her and her children.

30:11.292 --> 30:12.917
And if one of them goes deaf,

30:15.584 --> 30:16.834
too bad.

30:17.751 --> 30:19.042
That's life."

30:28.459 --> 30:30.917
My wrist could have really used

30:31.084 --> 30:33.959
one of your broken bottles
of perfume.

30:34.751 --> 30:36.626
What rotten luck.

30:37.376 --> 30:41.292
Such a pretty young girl
cutting herself like that.

30:43.167 --> 30:45.001
Lucky it wasn't serious.

33:35.959 --> 33:37.876
We can't take your call
at the moment.

33:38.084 --> 33:39.584
Please leave a message.

33:40.167 --> 33:41.251
It's Slatan.

33:44.834 --> 33:46.917
This phone is safe.

33:47.334 --> 33:50.001
The plane has been delayed
a few days by the storm.

33:50.542 --> 33:52.459
If I don't receive instructions,

33:52.584 --> 33:55.251
I'll blow myself up
at the Limbads Hotel.

33:56.501 --> 33:57.709
I repeat.

34:00.209 --> 34:01.251
I can kill...

34:03.584 --> 34:06.626
I can kill 20 or 30 people.

34:10.958 --> 34:12.292
For Karadjistan!

34:21.083 --> 34:23.792
THU RS DAY

34:40.167 --> 34:41.417
Go away!

34:46.333 --> 34:47.542
Go away!

34:52.583 --> 34:53.501
Dog...

35:04.334 --> 35:05.334
Easy...

35:10.667 --> 35:11.792
Good boy.

35:29.126 --> 35:30.251
Stay there.

35:32.584 --> 35:33.709
Stay.

35:56.209 --> 35:57.209
Eugene.

35:57.834 --> 35:59.167
Your roommate,

35:59.501 --> 36:00.626
the Russian...

36:00.792 --> 36:01.751
He never talks.

36:02.001 --> 36:03.834
No, he's a little shy.

36:05.584 --> 36:07.084
I'm calling from

36:07.251 --> 36:09.667
room 104, Slatan Sveraev.

36:10.042 --> 36:12.626
- Has anyone called me?
- One moment.

36:13.876 --> 36:16.001
No, you have no calls.

36:23.917 --> 36:27.001
Shy'? I would say anti-social.

36:27.167 --> 36:29.167
He doesn't even say hi to people.

36:30.542 --> 36:32.667
Alex, honey, wipe your face.

36:33.834 --> 36:35.834
Stop teaching them gross things.

36:36.084 --> 36:39.084
Let's not judge Slatan
for not saying hi once.

36:39.251 --> 36:42.376
It's not only that.
He kind of scares me.

36:42.584 --> 36:45.917
Not just his appearance,
it's the look in his eye.

36:52.417 --> 36:53.626
What look?

36:54.334 --> 36:55.459
Listen.

36:56.584 --> 37:00.959
Dragging my ass across the world
for 30 years has taught me 2 things:

37:01.167 --> 37:02.459
The first...

37:02.584 --> 37:04.334
Sanardy Shoes
make you walk better.

37:04.584 --> 37:05.709
That...

37:08.209 --> 37:10.501
Russia has offended our honor,

37:10.709 --> 37:12.876
murdered our hope.

37:13.042 --> 37:14.084
The second:

37:14.501 --> 37:16.334
How to know people.

37:16.834 --> 37:20.042
You look at the Russian
and what do you see?

37:20.292 --> 37:22.292
He doesn't wear Christian Dior,

37:22.501 --> 37:24.292
his cell phone is out of credit...

37:24.626 --> 37:28.167
he doesn't go around telling jokes
in the hallway“.

37:28.334 --> 37:31.334
100 years of oppression are enough.

37:31.501 --> 37:32.709
And you know why?

37:33.542 --> 37:35.959
Because something tragic
happened to him.

37:36.126 --> 37:38.126
Something is wrong
and he carries it inside.

37:38.334 --> 37:39.709
He doesn't sleep.

37:39.917 --> 37:41.834
He spends the whole night

37:42.001 --> 37:44.917
pacing back and forth,
consumed by his anguish.

37:48.876 --> 37:50.542
Maybe he never talks,
that's true.

37:51.292 --> 37:52.584
But he listens.

37:53.542 --> 37:55.167
So what?
Is that weird?

38:00.792 --> 38:02.751
Maybe we're the ones
who are weird.

38:03.001 --> 38:05.292
We let him eat breakfast
alone in a corner.

38:24.167 --> 38:25.584
For Karadjistan!

38:31.459 --> 38:32.584
For my people!

38:33.167 --> 38:34.751
Slatan Sveraev!

38:38.084 --> 38:38.917
Your call.

38:40.209 --> 38:41.459
Your call.

38:45.417 --> 38:46.501
Slatan?

38:48.334 --> 38:50.001
We heard your message.

38:52.251 --> 38:54.209
The mission is still on.

38:54.376 --> 38:56.834
You must blow up the plane
in ﬂight.

38:58.001 --> 39:01.917
Until then, behave like
a normal passenger.

39:02.334 --> 39:04.084
- Understood?
Understood.

39:10.209 --> 39:12.001
For your people, Ruskie.

39:13.417 --> 39:15.542
- For your people, Slatan.
- For your people.

39:15.709 --> 39:16.917
For your people.

39:18.876 --> 39:20.251
Thank you.

39:22.959 --> 39:24.292
Thank you.

39:35.459 --> 39:38.084
He is a little weird.
Just a little.

39:51.959 --> 39:54.292
I saved this for you,
or the Chinese will eat it.

39:54.459 --> 39:56.334
You have a button loose.

39:56.501 --> 39:58.917
Take off your coat,
I'll mend it for you.

39:59.084 --> 40:00.751
We hear you're buying breakfast.

40:00.959 --> 40:01.876
Nice touch!

40:05.167 --> 40:06.376
We're keeping you company.

40:06.542 --> 40:07.876
I'll trade you this cookie.

40:08.501 --> 40:10.334
These are delicious.

40:11.626 --> 40:12.959
Here's to you, Slatan.

40:15.917 --> 40:18.501
He's scratching his head a lot.

40:18.626 --> 40:19.667
So is he.

40:21.917 --> 40:22.876
What?

40:26.751 --> 40:29.626
My God, look at all those
split ends.

40:30.584 --> 40:33.001
I think you got lice
from the boy.

40:33.334 --> 40:36.834
Lola. How about a ride
in my convertible?

40:37.001 --> 40:41.126
Oh, a sled! Okay. I'll put up
my hair like Grace Kelly.

40:41.334 --> 40:43.626
As long as we don't end up
like her.

40:45.251 --> 40:47.042
Okay, you two are on your own.

40:48.751 --> 40:50.126
Where are you going?

40:55.042 --> 40:56.001
Okay--

40:56.667 --> 41:00.792
By the way, my name is Anunciacién,
but everyone calls me Nancy.

41:01.001 --> 41:02.417
After the doll.

41:04.334 --> 41:07.084
I'm Slatan Sveraev.

41:07.417 --> 41:08.501
Nice to meet you.

41:10.626 --> 41:12.209
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes.

41:44.876 --> 41:46.542
Wait, it won't rinse out.

41:47.084 --> 41:48.167
Sorry.

41:49.959 --> 41:51.459
I need your help.

41:51.626 --> 41:54.876
Hold the towel with your hand.

42:00.792 --> 42:03.209
It's very pretty.
What does "nadezhda“ mean?

42:06.334 --> 42:07.459
Hope.

42:10.626 --> 42:11.751
Hope?

42:14.459 --> 42:16.459
Wow, the Ruskie is sensitive.

42:19.126 --> 42:20.167
Ready.

42:22.001 --> 42:23.042
Up.

42:24.459 --> 42:27.834
Parted in the middle, on the side
or shoulder-length?

43:09.667 --> 43:11.292
Hold on, Lola.

43:12.459 --> 43:14.667
Hold on tight
or you'll go flying.

43:14.834 --> 43:17.417
This thing is a rocket
going down the hill.

43:18.126 --> 43:21.209
Trust me, Lola, don't hold back.
Come on.

43:21.709 --> 43:22.751
That's it.

43:23.751 --> 43:26.417
Go with the flow,
you're with an expert.

43:30.376 --> 43:32.126
Our trip was insured, right?

43:32.292 --> 43:35.167
You should send an SUV
or a damn tank for us.

43:36.084 --> 43:39.459
Mr. Garrido, I'm going to take
legal action.

43:40.792 --> 43:42.417
Slatan, watch out...

43:42.542 --> 43:44.459
We're almost there,
one last push.

43:50.501 --> 43:52.126
You look very handsome.

43:53.792 --> 43:56.376
Who does your hair, Slatan?

43:58.209 --> 44:00.584
You're dangerous with scissors, huh?

44:06.376 --> 44:07.501
You know what?

44:09.459 --> 44:14.126
A lot of people have tried
to dissuade me from killing myself.

44:15.542 --> 44:17.834
But nobody had ever
given me advice

44:18.376 --> 44:22.084
about how to do it
painlessly.

44:26.084 --> 44:27.459
That's very nice.

44:31.417 --> 44:32.834
Thank you, Slatan.

44:33.501 --> 44:34.626
You're welcome.

44:40.459 --> 44:41.626
Sorry! Hold on!

44:46.376 --> 44:47.459
Watch out!

44:57.126 --> 44:58.042
Eugene!

45:03.417 --> 45:06.292
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yes, yes.

45:06.459 --> 45:08.542
That was quite an impact!

45:08.751 --> 45:12.459
Just a scare.
It looked worse than it was.

45:12.792 --> 45:16.001
Hey, Ruskie.
I have a question for you.

45:16.209 --> 45:18.126
I need to ask him something.

45:18.376 --> 45:21.001
Listen... Come with me...

45:26.292 --> 45:27.751
I broke my balls.

45:28.042 --> 45:29.917
- Look at me.
- What are you doing?

45:30.084 --> 45:32.251
Is everything
where it should be?

45:32.417 --> 45:34.917
It was like an explosion,
a crunch...

45:35.084 --> 45:36.584
I felt something burst.

45:36.751 --> 45:38.709
- I'm coming, okay?
- Take a look.

45:38.959 --> 45:39.792
Please.

45:42.584 --> 45:43.376
Well?

45:48.084 --> 45:50.251
What the fuck am I doing here?

45:50.626 --> 45:52.542
Should I put it on ice?

46:25.792 --> 46:27.042
What's wrong?

46:27.209 --> 46:28.209
Get out.

46:28.376 --> 46:30.584
What's wrong?
If you have a problem, so do I.

46:30.751 --> 46:33.626
I must dry medicine,
need to keep warm.

46:33.792 --> 46:37.001
Problem of life or death.

46:38.709 --> 46:39.459
Don't worry.

46:43.167 --> 46:47.001
Please, everyone come out here.
The Ruskie has a problem.

46:47.209 --> 46:49.709
We need to dry his medicine.
We need heat.

46:49.917 --> 46:51.917
- A hair dryer.
- I have a heater.

46:52.084 --> 46:53.167
Please.

46:55.209 --> 46:56.959
- A hair dryer?
- Please.

46:57.126 --> 46:58.751
- I have an extension cord.
- Sure.

46:58.917 --> 47:01.001
- I have an electric blanket!
- Get it.

47:03.167 --> 47:04.251
MY hair dryer!

47:14.167 --> 47:15.459
It's dry.

47:46.459 --> 47:48.126
What a mess.

47:49.084 --> 47:50.501
Right, dog?

48:04.334 --> 48:07.667
I have a theory about heels
on shoes.

48:08.084 --> 48:11.626
Yes, I think the height is related
to a woman's problems.

48:12.001 --> 48:14.084
Two centimeters, few problems.

48:14.584 --> 48:17.501
Eight centimeters,
a ton of problems.

48:20.167 --> 48:21.584
I love them!

48:22.084 --> 48:24.917
Thank you very much.
They're beautiful.

48:25.459 --> 48:26.917
How high would yours be?

48:27.501 --> 48:28.626
Fifteen...

48:28.792 --> 48:30.626
-at least.
- Good lord.

48:31.001 --> 48:32.584
I don't think I have any...

48:41.751 --> 48:43.501
Have you got family?

48:44.667 --> 48:45.501
Divorced.

48:46.959 --> 48:51.042
Well, in Argentina getting divorced
is required for citizenship.

48:51.292 --> 48:53.542
It's in the Constitution.

48:54.667 --> 48:57.459
Selling shoes
in three countries a week...

48:58.084 --> 49:00.751
Well, you don't get home late.
You're never there.

49:03.126 --> 49:06.001
Maybe I married the wrong person.

49:06.709 --> 49:07.959
Me too.

49:09.459 --> 49:12.209
So I decided to run away
with my children.

49:12.501 --> 49:16.084
But the day right before
I got on the plane...

49:16.417 --> 49:17.584
he goes and leaves me.

49:19.417 --> 49:21.334
Myocardial heart attack.

49:21.584 --> 49:23.542
He drank vodka
like chocolate milk.

49:24.376 --> 49:25.667
I don't know...

49:25.959 --> 49:27.584
He's upstairs, in the room.

49:28.542 --> 49:30.376
- Here?
- His ashes.

49:30.542 --> 49:31.834
In the room.

49:45.167 --> 49:46.459
Here we go!

49:47.417 --> 49:49.792
Press 1 if you'd like to buy
an airline ticket.

49:49.959 --> 49:51.084
No.

49:51.376 --> 49:54.001
Press 2 if you'd like to speak
to check in.

49:54.167 --> 49:56.126
Not on your fucking life.

49:56.292 --> 49:59.084
Press 3 if you'd like to buy
insurance.

49:59.417 --> 50:01.792
Which later turns out to be useless.

50:01.959 --> 50:05.501
Explain the reason you're calling
briefly and clearly.

50:05.667 --> 50:06.917
Need ﬂight.

50:07.417 --> 50:10.584
We did not understand you.
Please repeat.

50:25.001 --> 50:27.667
That damn crematorium...

50:28.417 --> 50:32.042
They vacuum seal the urn
and I can't...

50:33.001 --> 50:33.792
Please.

50:39.792 --> 50:41.251
A tool of my trade.

50:46.042 --> 50:47.084
Sorry.

50:51.959 --> 50:54.209
This will be weird for him.

50:54.376 --> 50:56.334
All that ice and so little vodka.

50:59.084 --> 51:00.959
Did you want to say
a few words'?

51:01.667 --> 51:02.751
Fuck him.

51:03.459 --> 51:04.334
Amen.

51:29.542 --> 51:31.084
He said 89.

51:31.251 --> 51:33.334
Here we go. 43.

51:33.542 --> 51:35.126
Wait, wait, wait.

51:45.334 --> 51:46.584
I wanted...

51:47.459 --> 51:50.584
to thank you
because you helped me...

51:51.292 --> 51:52.584
It was nothing, son.

51:52.834 --> 51:54.001
Here, sit down.

51:54.209 --> 51:55.084
Come on.

51:56.459 --> 51:58.834
We have 33...

51:59.251 --> 52:00.459
Let's do this:

52:01.334 --> 52:03.501
How about you turn the lever

52:04.334 --> 52:06.042
-and say the number out loud.
- Go on.

52:07.667 --> 52:08.751
Here we go!

52:09.834 --> 52:12.876
I'm having a bad streak.

52:14.876 --> 52:15.751
Here, let me.

52:15.917 --> 52:17.167
Are you sure?

52:17.376 --> 52:19.251
- No, but...
- Okay.

52:19.626 --> 52:22.501
- He's all yours.
-53.

52:23.167 --> 52:25.167
In Russian, please.

52:27.542 --> 52:28.667
53.

52:29.501 --> 52:31.709
This feels like...

52:31.917 --> 52:34.709
-a vacation. It's funny.
- It is.

52:34.917 --> 52:36.042
At least for me.

52:39.667 --> 52:42.459
He always does that every time!

52:42.626 --> 52:43.876
Well, well...

52:44.042 --> 52:46.459
- Did he get you wet?
-It's holy water.

52:46.584 --> 52:48.084
- Holy water, he says!
- Sure.

52:48.292 --> 52:48.917
Silly.

52:49.084 --> 52:50.292
72.

52:53.501 --> 52:57.251
Who said I couldn't fly a kite
at 20 below?

52:57.917 --> 53:02.292
We've done everything
but play smash ball.

53:02.459 --> 53:03.501
Right, honey?

53:04.209 --> 53:05.209
Slatan.

53:05.376 --> 53:09.084
Give me a <i>22</i> and we'll run away
with the winnings.

53:09.542 --> 53:10.417
Okay?

53:10.751 --> 53:11.876
Let's go, bingo!

53:12.292 --> 53:14.292
Who has the bingo cards?

53:14.626 --> 53:17.084
- We'll play together.
- Are you having fun?

53:17.959 --> 53:20.459
Tell me' Are you enjoying
your honeymoon?

53:20.751 --> 53:22.709
Because while I eat shit
on the phone

53:22.876 --> 53:25.501
all you do is play with dessert,
your kite, the snowman

53:25.667 --> 53:27.584
and all the other crap!

53:32.209 --> 53:33.667
We have nothing in common.

53:36.459 --> 53:39.209
I married a little boy
who'll never grow up.

53:41.792 --> 53:43.417
Grow up? What for?

53:44.709 --> 53:47.251
To be unhappy, like you?

53:48.251 --> 53:51.459
Because you seem very sad to me,
Natalia.

53:54.459 --> 53:55.751
You know what the problem is?

53:57.292 --> 53:59.876
The honeymoon wasn't the reason
I got married.

54:01.084 --> 54:02.709
You are.

54:03.459 --> 54:05.417
And you choose where the sun

54:06.209 --> 54:07.709
and the beach are.

54:07.876 --> 54:10.751
That's Russia for you.
Plenty of sun and beach.

54:11.751 --> 54:13.376
That's how it is.

54:13.542 --> 54:16.376
Russian cuisine is good,
that's true.

54:16.542 --> 54:17.751
Yes, excellent.

54:17.917 --> 54:20.876
Ruskie, let's make a goulash
for everyone tonight.

54:21.709 --> 54:24.334
We can make Chinese food too.

54:24.501 --> 54:27.417
We'll find out if it's true
the Chinese eat each other.

54:28.001 --> 54:29.292
I'm kidding.

54:30.001 --> 54:31.459
Where's your friend?

54:33.251 --> 54:35.959
How about it, Ruskie?
Let's cook.

54:36.126 --> 54:39.626
Goulash, goulash, goulash!

54:39.792 --> 54:40.751
Goulash!

54:40.917 --> 54:42.459
Goulash, goulash!

54:49.917 --> 54:51.376
I'm not from Russia!

54:53.542 --> 54:56.167
I'm not from Russia, Eugene.
I'm from Karadjistan.

55:00.501 --> 55:02.834
Karadjistan. Do you know
where that is on a map?

55:04.376 --> 55:05.334
No.

55:06.792 --> 55:09.376
My people were crushed by Russia.

55:11.042 --> 55:12.834
And they exiled us.

55:13.001 --> 55:15.709
They cut our electricity,
communications.

55:16.001 --> 55:17.167
Power.

55:17.917 --> 55:19.042
Food!

55:22.501 --> 55:25.042
Did the United Nations
do anything?

55:27.167 --> 55:28.126
No.

55:28.834 --> 55:31.126
Domestic problem, they called it.

55:31.751 --> 55:34.959
Nothing is what your countries do.

55:37.167 --> 55:38.626
They do nothing.

55:45.334 --> 55:47.542
And after years of embargo...

55:48.501 --> 55:50.459
nothing is left.

55:52.001 --> 55:53.626
No hospital.

55:54.584 --> 55:57.042
No medicine. No antibiotic.

55:57.917 --> 56:00.042
Children die and diarrhea.

56:02.667 --> 56:04.876
And then bombing start.

56:12.292 --> 56:13.459
Ravil!

56:30.167 --> 56:31.001
Slatan.

56:32.001 --> 56:32.834
Slatan.

56:33.959 --> 56:34.751
Slatan.

56:35.792 --> 56:37.792
Slatan, I need you in the hall.
It's urgent.

56:38.042 --> 56:39.376
Please, hurry.

56:40.751 --> 56:41.667
Camilo!

56:42.001 --> 56:42.709
What?

56:43.251 --> 56:44.626
We have to wait?

56:45.542 --> 56:46.751
Half an hour?

56:47.834 --> 56:49.042
Please. Please.

56:49.292 --> 56:52.876
Alex, Lola's son, ran off into
the woods. It's been half an hour.

56:53.042 --> 56:55.209
- Let's do a sweep.
- We need to hurry.

56:55.334 --> 56:58.209
- It's 30 below.
- My boy won't hear us.

56:58.334 --> 57:01.709
But he'll see us.
Don't worry, we'll find him.

57:01.959 --> 57:03.334
- Oh my God.
- Here.

57:03.917 --> 57:05.792
No, I'm not going.

57:05.959 --> 57:07.751
What? Weren't you listening?

57:07.917 --> 57:10.126
A 7-year-old boy
is freezing to death.

57:14.542 --> 57:18.792
I'm not going. 30 below zero.
Boy is dead.

57:21.334 --> 57:22.334
Lola...

57:22.834 --> 57:23.959
Lola!

57:25.959 --> 57:27.792
How can you say that?

57:28.292 --> 57:30.959
I thought I knew people.
I don't know shit.

57:35.542 --> 57:36.417
Go on.

57:39.417 --> 57:40.417
Go.

57:43.334 --> 57:44.709
You know something?

57:45.042 --> 57:47.126
You should get another tattoo

57:47.292 --> 57:49.959
that says there is no hope.

57:50.459 --> 57:53.876
Because there's a little boy
alone out there in the snow

57:54.042 --> 57:56.251
waiting for his mother
to find him.

57:56.376 --> 57:58.834
And he's going to die
like a little bird.

57:59.084 --> 58:00.209
You know?

58:01.251 --> 58:02.042
You don't care.

58:04.959 --> 58:07.042
You're dead, Slatan.
You're dead.

58:09.709 --> 58:12.001
And you don't know
how sorry I am.

58:26.334 --> 58:27.459
Alex!

58:29.126 --> 58:30.042
Alex!

58:52.709 --> 58:54.334
Mauthausen.

58:54.542 --> 58:56.501
1944.

58:58.042 --> 59:00.126
I know what you were
talking about in there.

59:00.376 --> 59:04.376
The bombing, the killing,
the horror...

59:07.459 --> 59:10.709
I can't complain. I'm alive.

59:11.834 --> 59:13.251
Mom, Dad...

59:14.959 --> 59:17.376
My five brothers and sisters.

59:17.709 --> 59:20.542
They all ended up getting cremated.

59:22.042 --> 59:24.417
Some nights I still dream about

59:24.917 --> 59:28.459
the smell coming out
of the smokestacks.

59:31.334 --> 59:33.584
The smell of Mom and Dad.

59:40.042 --> 59:43.417
Son, no matter how much
you've suffered,

59:43.834 --> 59:46.751
there's always someone
who suffers more than you.

59:46.959 --> 59:47.667
Always.

59:52.584 --> 59:53.834
Alex!

01:00:31.251 --> 01:00:32.459
Find!

01:00:33.209 --> 01:00:34.251
Slatan?

01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:39.042
Slatan!

01:00:42.042 --> 01:00:43.084
Slatan!

01:00:44.334 --> 01:00:45.334
Slatan...

01:00:47.667 --> 01:00:48.667
Slatan...

01:00:49.167 --> 01:00:50.417
Where are you going?

01:00:53.251 --> 01:00:56.542
Boy look for sound of quarry.
That way.

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:03.959
Alex!

01:01:04.251 --> 01:01:05.501
Where are you?

01:01:08.126 --> 01:01:09.709
Alex!

01:01:11.584 --> 01:01:13.209
Alex!

01:01:19.334 --> 01:01:20.334
Alex!

01:01:29.292 --> 01:01:30.792
Please, no...

01:01:34.376 --> 01:01:36.084
Please, no...

01:02:05.001 --> 01:02:06.042
Oh, my baby...

01:02:12.251 --> 01:02:13.376
My baby...

01:02:24.292 --> 01:02:26.001
<i>Thank you... Thank you...</i>

01:02:26.501 --> 01:02:27.459
Thank you...

01:03:27.626 --> 01:03:28.626
Look.

01:03:30.751 --> 01:03:31.917
Ravil.

01:03:34.667 --> 01:03:36.334
He's very handsome.

01:03:37.584 --> 01:03:38.709
Yeah.

01:03:39.584 --> 01:03:42.376
He took a long time
to come into this world.

01:03:43.917 --> 01:03:47.584
He didn't want to leave
his mother's belly.

01:03:47.959 --> 01:03:49.001
Smart, huh?

01:03:54.042 --> 01:03:58.126
Neighbor had to come
to help with birth.

01:03:59.376 --> 01:04:02.167
They had to cut her open
to take out.

01:04:04.126 --> 01:04:05.084
No doctor,

01:04:05.251 --> 01:04:06.834
no hospital...

01:04:10.584 --> 01:04:13.542
My wife died during the birth.

01:04:13.917 --> 01:04:15.709
But Ravil lived.

01:04:16.042 --> 01:04:17.709
And he didn't cry.

01:04:22.959 --> 01:04:25.584
Here we went to Kostani.

01:04:26.792 --> 01:04:27.834
Kostani?

01:04:29.417 --> 01:04:33.042
And I told him
that if he got lost,

01:04:33.751 --> 01:04:35.459
not to move.

01:04:35.709 --> 01:04:40.417
To stay where he was,
that Daddy would find him again.

01:04:40.584 --> 01:04:41.542
You know?

01:04:43.084 --> 01:04:46.667
And he looked at me
with face he made

01:04:48.042 --> 01:04:49.667
and went like this:

01:04:53.334 --> 01:04:55.542
When he did that everything...

01:04:57.251 --> 01:05:00.459
I knew everything would be okay.

01:05:00.626 --> 01:05:01.792
You know?

01:05:04.376 --> 01:05:06.042
And he got lost.

01:05:09.542 --> 01:05:11.459
And at 11:30...

01:05:12.334 --> 01:05:15.001
M-15 started bombing
like always.

01:05:16.501 --> 01:05:17.959
I lost Ravil...

01:05:19.584 --> 01:05:21.542
He was good boy.

01:05:21.834 --> 01:05:23.251
He didn't move.

01:05:26.792 --> 01:05:28.792
In the middle of square.

01:05:29.542 --> 01:05:31.042
Waiting.

01:05:31.417 --> 01:05:34.334
He held duck very tight.

01:05:35.126 --> 01:05:36.334
Tight.

01:05:36.751 --> 01:05:39.084
Very, very tight,

01:05:39.251 --> 01:05:41.167
like holding him...

01:05:41.334 --> 01:05:44.876
would keep him in world
of the living.

01:05:50.834 --> 01:05:51.959
But no.

01:06:01.751 --> 01:06:04.209
- Don't cry.
- No, I'm not crying.

01:06:04.834 --> 01:06:06.126
It's just...

01:06:23.334 --> 01:06:25.167
Good night, Nancy.

01:06:27.334 --> 01:06:28.667
You mean good morning.

01:07:36.292 --> 01:07:39.459
FRIDAY

01:07:58.542 --> 01:08:00.042
Don't be like that.

01:08:00.209 --> 01:08:03.042
It's a Christmas sweater
from Santa Claus.

01:08:03.792 --> 01:08:05.959
Your clothes are in tatters.

01:08:06.126 --> 01:08:08.584
Nancy and the rest of us
all chipped in...

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:10.251
Why don't you shut up
a little?

01:08:10.417 --> 01:08:11.626
Give me a hug.

01:08:13.167 --> 01:08:15.876
Take it easy, man, come on.
That's it.

01:08:17.334 --> 01:08:20.334
Thank you' Really.
For what you did

01:08:20.459 --> 01:08:23.209
for the boy.
I misjudged you at first,

01:08:23.792 --> 01:08:26.792
but I care about Lola and the boys
very much and...

01:08:27.001 --> 01:08:29.626
We stayed up all night talking...

01:08:29.834 --> 01:08:32.167
"Pim, pum, pam...“
Until dawn.

01:08:32.376 --> 01:08:33.959
-"Pim, pum, pam?"
- What?

01:08:34.126 --> 01:08:36.917
-"Pim, pum, pam?"
- No, no...

01:08:37.292 --> 01:08:40.209
No, talking, really.
She's a wonderful woman.

01:08:40.334 --> 01:08:42.292
I see love here!

01:08:42.417 --> 01:08:43.334
- No, no...
- What?

01:08:43.751 --> 01:08:46.667
It would be crazy.
We live on different continents.

01:08:48.084 --> 01:08:49.251
Come on.

01:08:49.459 --> 01:08:51.792
Look at him run!

01:08:58.167 --> 01:08:59.042
Bravo!

01:09:04.792 --> 01:09:05.751
Thank you!

01:09:08.959 --> 01:09:09.959
Hero!

01:09:10.751 --> 01:09:11.709
Brave!

01:09:11.917 --> 01:09:13.042
How are you?

01:09:13.667 --> 01:09:14.709
Are you okay?

01:09:19.417 --> 01:09:20.334
He's okay.

01:10:08.542 --> 01:10:09.542
Bravo!

01:10:16.751 --> 01:10:20.626
Okay, we can let the lovebirds
go back to their honeymoon

01:10:20.834 --> 01:10:22.209
and keep the party going.

01:10:22.334 --> 01:10:24.709
Who wants to give it a try?
Come on!

01:10:25.667 --> 01:10:28.792
Slatan, sing a song from Rajistan,
from your country.

01:10:28.959 --> 01:10:30.501
Yeah, come on!

01:10:31.417 --> 01:10:33.251
- Let's hear it!
- I don't want...

01:10:33.376 --> 01:10:34.292
Sing!

01:10:34.459 --> 01:10:36.417
Sing! Sing!

01:10:37.542 --> 01:10:39.542
Everybody settle down.

01:10:39.876 --> 01:10:41.126
Singing isn't Slatan's style.

01:10:41.334 --> 01:10:42.334
But yes,

01:10:42.542 --> 01:10:44.751
- I can sing a song for you.
- Okay.

01:10:47.126 --> 01:10:48.001
0K8)'-

01:10:48.417 --> 01:10:49.584
Come on!

01:10:50.501 --> 01:10:51.709
I can't believe it!

01:10:51.959 --> 01:10:52.917
Let's go!

01:10:54.542 --> 01:10:55.834
I can't believe it!

01:11:01.709 --> 01:11:03.209
Let's go, my friend.

01:11:03.459 --> 01:11:05.209
The stage is yours, Slatan.

01:11:05.376 --> 01:11:08.042
- I only know one.
- Then sing that one.

01:11:08.209 --> 01:11:10.209
- Or sing another one.
- Stud!

01:11:17.251 --> 01:11:21.626
Russia has offended our honor,

01:11:21.792 --> 01:11:25.209
murdered our hope.

01:11:25.501 --> 01:11:29.667
100 years of oppression are enough.

01:11:30.042 --> 01:11:32.959
We will not hang our heads.

01:11:33.667 --> 01:11:36.542
We will not forgive their insults.

01:11:37.042 --> 01:11:40.459
We will never forget our fallen.

01:11:41.542 --> 01:11:44.501
We will fight the enemies
who strangle us.

01:11:44.667 --> 01:11:47.417
We will fight to the end!

01:11:48.167 --> 01:11:49.459
To the end!

01:11:52.417 --> 01:11:54.584
The enemy will die.

01:11:54.792 --> 01:11:56.001
The enemy will die.

01:11:56.209 --> 01:11:59.167
All of our enemies will die.

01:11:59.334 --> 01:12:01.792
They will die, they will die,
they will die.

01:12:02.292 --> 01:12:03.584
Our country

01:12:04.126 --> 01:12:06.042
we will free.

01:12:06.209 --> 01:12:10.667
We will never give in
to the enemy.

01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:12.334
Quiet!

01:12:12.959 --> 01:12:13.876
Quiet.

01:12:17.667 --> 01:12:24.459
Russia has offended our honor,

01:12:25.084 --> 01:12:29.501
murdered our hope.

01:12:30.292 --> 01:12:35.084
100 years of oppression are enough.

01:12:35.667 --> 01:12:38.209
We will fight to the end.

01:12:38.834 --> 01:12:41.792
Russia has offended our honor,

01:12:42.001 --> 01:12:45.042
murdered our hope.

01:12:45.251 --> 01:12:48.459
100 years of oppression are enough.

01:12:48.626 --> 01:12:50.709
All of our enemies will die.

01:12:51.626 --> 01:12:52.751
They will die!

01:12:53.334 --> 01:12:55.751
They will die!

01:12:57.959 --> 01:12:58.876
Bravo!

01:13:14.792 --> 01:13:16.292
Is that tasty?

01:13:23.334 --> 01:13:25.126
Well, dog...

01:13:27.126 --> 01:13:29.084
How are you doing?

01:14:00.292 --> 01:14:03.042
The airport will be opening
in one hour.

01:14:06.626 --> 01:14:10.376
The bus outside will take you
to the international terminal.

01:14:20.042 --> 01:14:22.417
The plan is still on.

01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:24.084
As we agreed.

01:14:25.167 --> 01:14:26.417
Is that clear?

01:14:27.709 --> 01:14:28.834
It's clear.

01:14:31.334 --> 01:14:32.251
You...

01:14:32.834 --> 01:14:36.709
You're a rock star, Slatan.

01:14:37.959 --> 01:14:40.584
You're the man, Slatan.

01:14:40.834 --> 01:14:43.459
The fucking king.
Holy shit.

01:14:43.667 --> 01:14:45.501
Forget about Bon Jovi.

01:14:45.792 --> 01:14:47.042
Spaniard...

01:14:47.709 --> 01:14:50.959
When we get back to Madrid,
set up a concert!

01:15:05.584 --> 01:15:08.834
For you this has been
a mountain holiday.

01:15:09.292 --> 01:15:12.084
- Your mission ends here.
- No.

01:15:15.084 --> 01:15:19.792
You can go back to your family.
They're waiting for you.

01:15:24.292 --> 01:15:26.417
Tell your parents

01:15:29.584 --> 01:15:31.501
that you'll be home for dinner.

01:15:33.001 --> 01:15:38.292
And your wife Yedé will be there,
celebrating your return.

01:15:43.459 --> 01:15:45.542
You must be eager to see...

01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:49.042
your son Ravil

01:15:50.042 --> 01:15:52.126
after all this time.

01:16:14.001 --> 01:16:17.126
Of course I want to see
my son Ravil.

01:16:19.459 --> 01:16:20.751
And I Will.

01:16:29.334 --> 01:16:30.917
Everything is fine.

01:16:33.584 --> 01:16:35.001
Don't worry.

01:17:09.626 --> 01:17:12.417
Come on, we're leaving!

01:17:13.001 --> 01:17:14.917
The rickety bus is here!

01:17:15.084 --> 01:17:16.376
Let's go!

01:17:16.542 --> 01:17:17.834
Excuse me...

01:17:19.042 --> 01:17:20.959
Bye-bye Russia!

01:17:21.126 --> 01:17:22.376
Here we go!

01:17:22.542 --> 01:17:24.459
The best honeymoon!

01:17:24.667 --> 01:17:25.959
The Caribbean is overrated.

01:17:26.126 --> 01:17:27.167
Slatan...

01:17:27.584 --> 01:17:29.542
I was looking for you.

01:17:35.001 --> 01:17:36.042
What...?

01:18:15.209 --> 01:18:17.126
It's just a little cold.

01:18:17.334 --> 01:18:21.376
The 30 below zero will make him
stronger. Like an Eskimo.

01:18:22.834 --> 01:18:24.501
What's the plan
when you get there?

01:18:25.584 --> 01:18:29.667
Well... my sister is picking me up
at the airport after all.

01:18:30.167 --> 01:18:33.167
Just as well.
Because with the baby

01:18:33.334 --> 01:18:34.959
-and stroller...
- Yes.

01:18:35.126 --> 01:18:36.459
And the bus to Madrid...

01:18:37.834 --> 01:18:38.959
And you?

01:18:42.084 --> 01:18:43.417
Run around, as usual.

01:18:43.584 --> 01:18:45.209
- All over the place.
- Right.

01:18:45.751 --> 01:18:46.667
- Eugene.
- Yes?

01:18:46.834 --> 01:18:48.667
Sorry. Somethings wrong
with Slatan.

01:18:48.834 --> 01:18:51.542
He's been in the bathroom
for 20 minutes.

01:18:51.709 --> 01:18:53.751
After the fajitas the other day,

01:18:53.876 --> 01:18:55.084
I'm not surprised...

01:18:55.501 --> 01:18:56.542
Excuse me.

01:18:57.292 --> 01:18:58.126
Lola.

01:18:58.459 --> 01:19:00.084
Go ahead and board.

01:19:12.667 --> 01:19:13.834
What is it?

01:19:14.126 --> 01:19:15.751
What's wrong with him?

01:19:19.667 --> 01:19:20.876
What is that?

01:19:24.667 --> 01:19:26.001
It's a bomb!

01:19:26.501 --> 01:19:27.459
Eugene!

01:19:30.209 --> 01:19:31.667
Son of a bitch.

01:19:32.126 --> 01:19:34.834
You said it was medicine
and it's a bomb.

01:19:38.584 --> 01:19:40.501
There's a terrorist
in the airport.

01:19:40.834 --> 01:19:41.709
We don't understand.

01:19:48.542 --> 01:19:49.709
Say it's not true.

01:20:01.751 --> 01:20:03.417
They don't trust me.

01:20:03.917 --> 01:20:05.084
What? What's wrong?

01:20:05.251 --> 01:20:06.834
There's another terrorist.

01:20:08.834 --> 01:20:09.834
Eugene...

01:20:11.251 --> 01:20:12.042
Understand?

01:20:13.584 --> 01:20:14.584
Where are you going?

01:20:15.167 --> 01:20:16.251
Eugene!

01:20:16.417 --> 01:20:17.167
Eugene...

01:20:17.959 --> 01:20:19.084
Eugene, I swear...

01:20:20.209 --> 01:20:21.792
I swear on my son Ravil

01:20:22.126 --> 01:20:24.334
that you aren't wrong about me.

01:20:24.584 --> 01:20:26.501
Andrei, come over here.
They only speak Spanish.

01:20:26.667 --> 01:20:30.251
There's more medicine
on the plane...

01:20:30.542 --> 01:20:32.209
What's the problem?

01:20:35.917 --> 01:20:36.792
Dad?

01:20:37.834 --> 01:20:39.876
He's my father.

01:20:40.042 --> 01:20:42.001
He's not well.

01:20:42.667 --> 01:20:43.459
Everything's fine.

01:20:44.126 --> 01:20:46.209
They'll catch the terrorist, okay?

01:20:46.876 --> 01:20:49.251
Are you wearing Mom's shoes again?

01:20:49.501 --> 01:20:50.459
Sorry.

01:20:55.376 --> 01:20:57.917
He'll try to detonate bomb
in the air.

01:20:58.084 --> 01:21:00.209
We have to disarm him
before we take off.

01:21:00.417 --> 01:21:05.126
He has a detonator on his chest
and delay button in his hand.

01:21:07.251 --> 01:21:11.417
If he sees any police or notices
anything strange, he won't hesitate.

01:21:11.959 --> 01:21:13.626
He'll blow himself up.

01:21:15.626 --> 01:21:18.001
So we have to do it
by ourselves.

01:22:13.792 --> 01:22:15.542
Pardon me, sir.

01:22:17.709 --> 01:22:20.459
I just married
this pretty little mouse...

01:22:20.876 --> 01:22:22.334
and they gave us separate seats.

01:22:22.501 --> 01:22:24.584
Would you mind changing seats?

01:22:24.876 --> 01:22:25.709
Excuse me.

01:22:26.209 --> 01:22:27.751
I'll change with you.

01:22:27.917 --> 01:22:29.626
Okay, yeah.

01:22:43.376 --> 01:22:45.376
Young people
still get married, huh?

01:22:45.917 --> 01:22:49.376
They don't know what comes after.
Break-ups, lawyers...

01:22:49.584 --> 01:22:50.834
A total bust.

01:22:51.126 --> 01:22:52.626
Hooray for the newlyweds!

01:22:56.001 --> 01:22:57.626
Here, let me hold him.

01:22:58.334 --> 01:23:00.167
Let me hold him,
see if he calms down.

01:23:03.209 --> 01:23:04.959
Come here...

01:23:05.251 --> 01:23:07.209
It's okay, come here...

01:23:07.417 --> 01:23:08.209
Come on.

01:23:08.834 --> 01:23:13.167
Just as I thought, a full nappy.
Let's change you.

01:23:14.209 --> 01:23:16.001
Do you need some help?

01:23:16.167 --> 01:23:17.834
- It looks like it.
- Thanks.

01:23:18.001 --> 01:23:19.501
It's not easy in a plane.

01:23:19.667 --> 01:23:21.292
I'm good with kids.

01:23:21.501 --> 01:23:23.292
Yeah, they love me.

01:23:31.584 --> 01:23:32.834
Here we go...

01:23:36.834 --> 01:23:38.001
That's it...

01:23:42.751 --> 01:23:44.542
Here, take him...

01:23:46.251 --> 01:23:47.126
Sorry...

01:23:47.292 --> 01:23:48.126
Easy...

01:23:49.501 --> 01:23:50.542
He's a baby.

01:24:03.792 --> 01:24:04.417
Slatan!

01:24:29.376 --> 01:24:30.209
Slatan...

01:24:30.584 --> 01:24:32.417
- Hold him tight.
- Are you okay?

01:24:32.584 --> 01:24:34.001
- Nancy.
- What?

01:24:34.334 --> 01:24:36.917
He pressed delay button.

01:24:37.542 --> 01:24:38.834
What does that mean?

01:24:39.001 --> 01:24:42.626
That bomb will explode
in 4 minutes.

01:24:48.376 --> 01:24:50.626
Slatan, what are you going to do?

01:24:52.042 --> 01:24:53.917
Get the bomb out of here.

01:24:58.751 --> 01:25:02.334
Tell the captain to stop the plane
or it will explode.

01:25:02.542 --> 01:25:03.709
- Slatan, don't!
- Oh my God...

01:25:04.584 --> 01:25:07.501
Take emergency positions
and lean forward.

01:25:10.292 --> 01:25:12.376
- I'm not letting go.
- Nancy...

01:25:12.876 --> 01:25:15.209
There's a bomb on board.
I repeat...

01:25:16.209 --> 01:25:18.167
- Nancy...
- I'm not letting go...

01:25:18.334 --> 01:25:20.292
I go wherever you go.

01:25:20.459 --> 01:25:22.084
- You can't come!
- Yes!

01:25:22.626 --> 01:25:25.167
Get it out of here...
Everyone...

01:25:25.334 --> 01:25:26.459
Sound the alarm!

01:25:34.042 --> 01:25:34.834
Are you okay?

01:25:39.917 --> 01:25:42.084
We have to start over.

01:25:42.376 --> 01:25:44.792
Start over in Russian prison?

01:26:43.334 --> 01:26:44.084
Stop!

01:26:45.084 --> 01:26:46.542
I said stop!

01:26:48.334 --> 01:26:50.167
Stop. you scum!

01:26:54.417 --> 01:26:56.376
Get down on the ground!

01:26:58.626 --> 01:27:01.001
I said get down on the ground!

01:27:16.876 --> 01:27:19.042
Hands on your head!

01:27:44.792 --> 01:27:46.709
Go away, dog.

01:27:47.084 --> 01:27:48.626
Go away. No!

01:27:49.542 --> 01:27:50.459
Go away!

01:27:50.834 --> 01:27:51.834
Go!

01:27:57.626 --> 01:27:58.959
Get away from me!

01:28:04.834 --> 01:28:07.334
Prepare to fire!
Stop or we'll shoot!

01:28:08.501 --> 01:28:10.584
Stop!

01:28:10.876 --> 01:28:11.876
Get away!

01:28:12.292 --> 01:28:13.834
First and second, fire!

01:29:01.876 --> 01:29:03.751
I'm his girlfriend!

01:29:08.376 --> 01:29:10.001
If you die, I'll kill you.

01:29:11.209 --> 01:29:13.292
If you die, I'll kill you...

01:29:14.209 --> 01:29:18.834
You told the police
you're my girlfriend?

01:29:19.334 --> 01:29:20.126
Yeah.

01:29:21.667 --> 01:29:22.501
Yeah.

01:29:23.292 --> 01:29:27.292
I finally find a good man and look
what trouble you get yourself into.

01:29:29.626 --> 01:29:31.251
Don't talk now.

01:29:41.792 --> 01:29:43.084
It will be okay.

01:29:43.334 --> 01:29:44.292
Yes.

01:30:00.417 --> 01:30:01.209
Slatan!

01:30:03.751 --> 01:30:05.667
Sorry. Sorry.

01:30:05.834 --> 01:30:07.959
- Sorry.
-It's okay.

01:30:25.876 --> 01:30:26.834
Take it.

01:30:37.376 --> 01:30:38.251
Slatan!

01:30:38.792 --> 01:30:41.667
What did one terrorist say
to the other terrorist?

01:30:42.626 --> 01:30:44.542
This is gonna be a blast!

01:30:54.209 --> 01:30:55.126
Slatan!

01:30:58.292 --> 01:31:01.084
There's always someone
who suffers more than you.

01:31:01.376 --> 01:31:03.542
And you only have two choices:

01:31:04.001 --> 01:31:06.084
Either rot inside,

01:31:06.917 --> 01:31:10.584
or dance to the rhythm of life.

01:31:55.667 --> 01:31:59.334
