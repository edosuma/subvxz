00:01.501 --> 00:02.068
This is the Evergreen

00:02.068 --> 00:03.737
This is the
Evergreen forest.

00:03.737 --> 00:05.872
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:07.974 --> 00:10.276
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.276 --> 00:11.978
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.480 --> 00:15.415
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:16.516 --> 00:17.517
Yikes!

00:18.218 --> 00:19.619
Yaaaah...

00:22.255 --> 00:23.656
Yeaaaah!

00:23.656 --> 00:26.626
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:33.967 --> 00:36.636
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:37.971 --> 00:39.472
Cyril Sneer!

00:42.942 --> 00:45.345
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:45.979 --> 00:47.647
the Raccoons!!

00:47.647 --> 00:49.649
♪ (show theme music) ♪

01:01.728 --> 01:04.964
It's often said that
a change is as good as a rest,

01:04.964 --> 01:06.800
and usually that's true.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.669
But things aren't very restful
around the Evergreen forest

01:09.669 --> 01:13.006
when Lady Baden-Baden decides
it's time for a change.

01:13.006 --> 01:15.075
Lady B-B: Ooh, Schaeffer.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.510
These are simply divine!

01:17.510 --> 01:20.680
Perfect for the Historical
Society's train ride

01:20.680 --> 01:22.615
and luncheon tomorrow.

01:22.615 --> 01:25.351
Of course, they could use just a

01:25.351 --> 01:28.254
teensy bit more cinnamon.

01:28.254 --> 01:30.156
Thanks,
Lady Baden-Baden.

01:30.156 --> 01:31.858
I don't normally cater, but

01:31.858 --> 01:34.561
if you like, I can make up a
basket of cakes for you.

01:34.561 --> 01:37.097
With a little more
cinnamon, of course.

01:37.097 --> 01:40.366
Lady B-B: Oooooh, you are a
darling, Schaeffer.

01:40.366 --> 01:42.735
Congratulations,
Lady Baden-Baden.

01:42.735 --> 01:44.070
I heard, your gardenias won

01:44.070 --> 01:45.905
the flower show again this year.

01:45.905 --> 01:48.675
Lady B-B:
Thank you, Melissa.

01:48.675 --> 01:51.211
You don't sound
too excited about it.

01:51.211 --> 01:52.846
Is something wrong?

01:52.846 --> 01:55.782
Lady B-B: Oh, not really.

01:55.782 --> 01:59.953
It's just that... nothing
is very exciting lately.

01:59.953 --> 02:03.623
The usual mad social world.

02:03.623 --> 02:06.192
I thought you
liked all that stuff?

02:06.192 --> 02:08.027
Lady B-B: Ooh, I do.

02:08.027 --> 02:12.265
But lately, I've been
so... unfulfilled.

02:12.265 --> 02:15.235
I envy you, Melissa.

02:15.235 --> 02:16.436
Me?

02:16.436 --> 02:17.904
Lady B-B: You have a career.

02:17.904 --> 02:21.040
You have a purpose...
a direction in life.

02:21.040 --> 02:26.212
Me? I just flutter about
on society business.

02:26.212 --> 02:27.847
Maybe you need a career.

02:27.847 --> 02:31.818
Hey, have you ever thought about
getting a job of some kind?

02:31.818 --> 02:35.255
Lady B-B: Ooh.
What a unique idea!

02:35.255 --> 02:38.958
But, how does one actually...

02:38.958 --> 02:41.828
find a job?

02:41.828 --> 02:44.697
Well, I sure could
use some full-time help

02:44.697 --> 02:46.432
around here, Lady Baden-Baden.

02:46.432 --> 02:48.735
Lady B-B: Oooh, capital idea!

02:48.735 --> 02:53.606
I certainly could do things
with the Blue Spruce Cafe.

02:53.606 --> 02:56.309
Can you, uh,
can you cook?

02:56.309 --> 02:58.178
Lady B-B: Can I cook?

02:58.178 --> 03:01.080
Why I'm a Cordon Bleu chef!

03:01.648 --> 03:02.649
Well...

03:02.649 --> 03:05.018
Lady B-B: Ooh, wait
til' I tell Knoxie

03:05.018 --> 03:07.353
I've found gainful employment.

03:07.353 --> 03:10.156
He'll be sooo thrilled!

03:10.156 --> 03:13.493
There is a lot to do,
but don't worry.

03:13.493 --> 03:16.162
I guarantee things will take a

03:16.162 --> 03:18.531
turn for the better around here.

03:21.167 --> 03:22.302
Fore!

03:22.302 --> 03:25.605
Hot diggity!

03:33.179 --> 03:34.214
What?!

03:38.851 --> 03:44.190
Pig 2: Boy, I can't wait
for our holiday next week.

03:44.190 --> 03:48.061
Pig 1: Yeah...
the romantic Porkonos.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.430
Pig 3: It won't be
much of a holiday.

03:50.430 --> 03:52.699
We haven't saved
enough money to make it

03:52.699 --> 03:54.334
to the end of the street!

03:54.334 --> 03:56.536
Never mind the Porkonos.

03:56.536 --> 03:59.706
Pig 2: As long as it's not a
holiday like last year's.

03:59.706 --> 04:03.710
Pig 3: Oh it wasn't so bad,
camping in the back yard.

04:03.710 --> 04:06.079
Pig 1: Until the
tent sprung a leak!

04:06.079 --> 04:08.548
Pig 2: We've got to get
some money somewhere.

04:08.548 --> 04:11.317
Pigs, get over here!!

04:11.317 --> 04:12.852
Pig 1: Ooof.

04:12.852 --> 04:14.053
Pig 2: Whoaaa!

04:14.053 --> 04:16.856
Pig 3: Oh.. Coming, boss.

04:16.856 --> 04:19.892
I might as well play
golf on the Sahara desert,

04:19.892 --> 04:22.629
the amount of time
I spend in sand traps.

04:22.629 --> 04:25.398
Pig 1: Sand wedge again, Sir?

04:25.398 --> 04:27.233
Pig 1: Oops. Waaahhh!

04:27.233 --> 04:29.335
I'll turn
you into a sandwich,

04:29.335 --> 04:31.371
if you don't watch
your lip, pig.

04:32.839 --> 04:34.540
Blast!!

04:34.540 --> 04:39.279
Hmm, speaking of
sandwiches, Mr. Sneer,

04:39.279 --> 04:42.348
would you happen
to know a good caterer?

04:42.348 --> 04:45.051
Now, how would
I know a good caterer?

04:45.051 --> 04:46.052
Ugh!

04:46.886 --> 04:47.954
Caterers?

04:47.954 --> 04:49.589
Anyone comes to my house,

04:50.623 --> 04:52.992
they bring their own food.

04:52.992 --> 04:56.629
Fiddle. What do you want a
caterer for anyway?

04:56.629 --> 04:59.232
I'm having a little
surprise party

04:59.232 --> 05:01.200
for Lady Baden-Baden,

05:01.200 --> 05:04.504
on the occasion
of our anniversary.

05:06.039 --> 05:09.976
Ah, I assume,
you'll be attending?

05:09.976 --> 05:12.312
Sure, Knox. Happy to.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.447
As long as you
get a good caterer.

05:14.447 --> 05:17.317
Ha-ha! I never
pass up a free meal.

05:18.184 --> 05:20.453
Pig 1: I just had
a brilliant idea.

05:20.453 --> 05:23.456
I know how we can
make some easy money.

05:23.456 --> 05:24.457
Ha!

05:24.457 --> 05:25.725
Pig 3: Ooooh, Lloyd.

05:25.725 --> 05:28.761
That's my favorite kind.

05:31.664 --> 05:35.234
Ehm-ehm-ehmn!

05:35.234 --> 05:37.503
♪ I was walking on the road, ♪

05:37.503 --> 05:39.739
♪ La-la-la-la-laaa ♪

05:43.976 --> 05:47.847
This was the
Blue Spruce Cafe,
last time I looked.

05:47.847 --> 05:50.683
Lady B-B: Ooooh, patrons!

05:50.683 --> 05:54.220
Um, not really,
Lady Baden-Baden.

05:54.220 --> 05:56.789
We just wanted a sandwich.

05:56.789 --> 05:59.292
Lady B-B: And do you
have reservations?

05:59.292 --> 06:01.894
♪ (high pitch note) ♪

06:01.894 --> 06:03.463
Yeah. I've got a few.

06:03.463 --> 06:06.499
Lady B-B: Bert, you're
not wearing a tie.

06:06.499 --> 06:09.535
We dooo have a
dress code, you know.

06:09.535 --> 06:12.205
There. Very dashing.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.873
Walk this way!

06:13.873 --> 06:16.676
Bravo! Smashing!

06:17.310 --> 06:20.346
Bert, what's
gateaux de foie blond

06:20.346 --> 06:22.882
avec cafe de la poste?

06:22.882 --> 06:24.350
I don't know, Cedric.

06:24.350 --> 06:25.752
But I'm pretty sure it's not

06:25.752 --> 06:28.221
a grilled cheese
sandwich and fries.

06:28.221 --> 06:33.025
(whispers) Bert, I don't
see any prices on this menu.

06:33.025 --> 06:36.229
Ehm, are the
gentlemen ready to order?

06:36.229 --> 06:39.132
Lady B-B: Well, what do you
think of our new menu?

06:39.132 --> 06:41.134
Great, Lady Baden-Baden,

06:41.134 --> 06:44.404
but em, he-he, we were kinda
hoping for a couple of

06:44.404 --> 06:47.006
peanut butter
sandwiches and a soda.

06:47.006 --> 06:49.575
Lady B-B: Well, for you,
two lovely boys,

06:49.575 --> 06:51.577
we'll make an exception.

06:51.577 --> 06:55.848
Boy, she sure has turned
this place around, eh Schaeffer?

06:55.848 --> 06:59.852
Yep, she sure has.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.922
Pig 1: Yes Sir. Mr. Knox!

07:02.922 --> 07:05.725
Pied De Cochon Catering delivers.

07:05.725 --> 07:08.094
Satisfaction guaranteed!

07:09.695 --> 07:13.699
Right, Mr. Knox, we'll discuss
the details this afternoon.

07:13.699 --> 07:15.334
Ciao.

07:15.334 --> 07:18.438
We got it!
Knox wants to hire us!

07:18.438 --> 07:21.674
Pig 2: Whoo-hoo,
finally some real money!

07:21.674 --> 07:24.043
Pig 3: That's my favorite kind.

07:24.877 --> 07:28.281
Knox? Hiring my pigs?

07:28.281 --> 07:30.516
Pig 2: Oooh, I'd like to see
the look on the boss's face,

07:30.516 --> 07:32.585
if he found out about this!

07:35.254 --> 07:36.889
What's this?!

07:36.889 --> 07:39.258
Meet Knox this afternoon,

07:39.258 --> 07:41.861
Blue Spruce Cafe.

07:41.861 --> 07:43.696
Employment?!?

07:43.696 --> 07:46.632
Those dirty little bacon bits!

07:46.632 --> 07:49.435
Those perfidious porkers.

07:49.435 --> 07:51.571
How could they do this to me?

07:51.571 --> 07:53.940
I've been like a father to them.

07:53.940 --> 07:56.776
They can't leave me for Knox!

07:57.710 --> 07:59.545
We'll see about this.

08:03.082 --> 08:03.516
What's with the

08:03.516 --> 08:07.453
What's with
the disguises, boys?

08:07.453 --> 08:11.891
Does Mr. Sneer disapprove
of your catering business?

08:11.891 --> 08:15.228
Pig 1: Oh no. The boss
backs us all the way!

08:15.228 --> 08:17.830
Pig 2: Usually,
he's on our backs.

08:17.830 --> 08:21.167
Pig 3: Uh..besides,
we're not in disguise.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.336
Pig 2: No, no. It's, um...

08:23.336 --> 08:25.838
protection from the sun.

08:25.838 --> 08:27.440
Pig 1: The ozone layer.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.609
It's breaking down, you know!

08:29.609 --> 08:33.346
And we're very sensitive
to ultra violet rays!

08:34.146 --> 08:35.781
I see.

08:35.781 --> 08:39.018
Well, let's get
down to business.

08:39.018 --> 08:44.123
Lady Baden-Baden is mighty
partial to French cuisine.

08:45.191 --> 08:48.694
What can you supply
for the surprise party?

08:48.694 --> 08:52.331
Pig 1: Oh, um, cuisine...
let's see now.

08:52.331 --> 08:55.067
What can we supply.. hmm..?

08:55.067 --> 08:58.871
Pig 2: Oh look! Isn't
that Lady Penelope Banos?

08:58.871 --> 09:03.476
Pig 3: In that striking chiffon
and leatherette jump suit?

09:03.476 --> 09:05.611
Tres chi chi..oops.

09:05.611 --> 09:08.814
My mistake, it's
not her after all.

09:08.814 --> 09:10.149
Pig 1: Uh hem.

09:10.149 --> 09:11.717
How does this sound?

09:11.717 --> 09:14.654
Pate de la champagne,

09:14.654 --> 09:17.990
escargot de la bougogne,

09:17.990 --> 09:21.661
sherried yams with pecan sauce

09:21.661 --> 09:25.464
and green peppercorn
vinaigrette with truffles?

09:25.464 --> 09:27.900
Uuh, that sounds
right fine, boys.

09:27.900 --> 09:31.037
Mighty fine.
You've got the contract.

09:31.037 --> 09:34.407
Pig 1: Great. You
won't
regret this, Mr. Knox.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.841
Pig 2: Well, we
better get started.

09:35.841 --> 09:38.511
See you at the party
tomorrow night, at 6:30!

09:41.180 --> 09:42.982
Lady Baden-Baden?

09:42.982 --> 09:46.152
Oh, wha-what are you doing here?

09:46.152 --> 09:48.087
Lady B-B: What does
it look like, Knoxie?

09:48.087 --> 09:50.356
I'm working!

09:50.356 --> 09:53.259
You are what?!

09:53.259 --> 09:56.228
Lady B-B: Yessss, I just
started this morning.

09:56.228 --> 09:58.130
Isn't it wonderful?

09:58.130 --> 09:59.532
Wonderful?

09:59.532 --> 10:02.068
It is an insult!

10:02.068 --> 10:05.538
No wife of mine works...
anywhere!

10:05.538 --> 10:08.374
You are coming home
with me, right now!

10:09.775 --> 10:13.546
Pig 1: Just put it all on
the boss's bill, Mr. Willow.

10:13.546 --> 10:17.617
Pig 3: We'll pay off the bill
with our huge profits.

10:19.385 --> 10:21.787
The boss will never know.

10:27.760 --> 10:30.262
A surprise
anniversary party.

10:30.262 --> 10:33.032
Mr. Knox is such a romantic.

10:33.032 --> 10:36.202
And Lady Baden-Baden
doesn't suspect a thing.

10:36.202 --> 10:39.071
I love surprise parties!

10:40.473 --> 10:43.042
Gee, I wonder who that is?

10:43.042 --> 10:45.044
Lady Baden-Baden!

10:45.044 --> 10:48.481
W-wh-what a... surprise.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.049
Lady Baden-Baden?

10:50.049 --> 10:55.321
Lady B-B:

10:55.321 --> 10:56.522
What's wrong?

10:56.522 --> 10:59.759
Lady B-B: Oh, Knoxie and I
just had a terrible fight!

10:59.759 --> 11:01.627
In public, no less.

11:01.627 --> 11:06.165
He.. he demanded,
I resign from my job.

11:06.165 --> 11:08.167
But why would
he want you to resign?

11:08.167 --> 11:10.670
Lady B-B: That's
exactly what I asked him.

11:10.670 --> 11:14.473
He said, 'women have no
place in the working world!'

11:14.473 --> 11:16.509
How could
he say such a thing?!

11:16.509 --> 11:18.210
In this day and age!

11:18.210 --> 11:20.746
Lady B-B: Oh, it's his
upbringing, Melissa.

11:20.746 --> 11:23.616
Old world, old values,

11:23.616 --> 11:25.584
old money.

11:25.584 --> 11:29.855
I told him to accept
me as I am, or leave.

11:30.623 --> 11:32.992
He left. And...

11:32.992 --> 11:38.197
And tomorrow is
our.. anniversary!

11:38.197 --> 11:41.033
Oooo, Melissa!

11:42.435 --> 11:44.737
I'm so unhappy!

11:45.438 --> 11:47.073
I'm telling you, son,

11:47.073 --> 11:48.741
they're abandoning us.

11:48.741 --> 11:51.177
They've got a
contract with Knox.

11:51.177 --> 11:53.446
It tears my heart out!

11:53.446 --> 11:56.182
Maybe you could
ask them to stay, Pop.

11:56.782 --> 11:58.451
Don't be ridiculous.

11:58.451 --> 12:00.086
I've got my pride!

12:00.086 --> 12:02.988
Well, how about being...

12:02.988 --> 12:04.657
nicer to them?

12:04.657 --> 12:06.292
What a horrible thought!

12:07.026 --> 12:08.594
But you're right.

12:08.594 --> 12:10.796
It might be worth a shot.

12:10.796 --> 12:14.066
I can't let those pigs work
for Knox without a fight.

12:14.066 --> 12:17.002
They know too much about
my business dealings.

12:17.903 --> 12:21.907
Pig 1: Now remember, we can't
let the boss see this stuff.

12:21.907 --> 12:24.009
Hi, boys!
Ahhh?

12:24.009 --> 12:25.911
What's going on?

12:25.911 --> 12:28.013
Pig 1: Eh..dinner, boss.

12:28.013 --> 12:29.982
We're, ah, making dinner.

12:29.982 --> 12:32.251
Dinner? Great idea!

12:32.251 --> 12:34.019
Mind if I pitch in boys?

12:34.019 --> 12:36.322
Many hands make
light work, you know.

12:37.790 --> 12:40.092
Pig 1: Well..I guess.

12:40.092 --> 12:43.195
Lloyd, get out the
French cookbook.

12:43.195 --> 12:45.064

Well, maybe not.

13:54.767 --> 13:57.269
Pig 1: The doorbell!
Pig 2: Who could that be?

13:57.269 --> 13:59.438
Relax, boys. I'll get it.

14:02.241 --> 14:06.579
Pig 3: Oh my.. There's something
very wrong with the boss.

14:07.746 --> 14:09.815
Knox? What do
you want now?

14:09.815 --> 14:10.983
My bears?

14:10.983 --> 14:14.520
Mr. Sneer, uh, Cyril,

14:14.520 --> 14:17.623
you are the only one
I can turn to

14:17.623 --> 14:19.992
in mah hour of deepest grief.

14:19.992 --> 14:22.027
What are you
babbling about, Knox?

14:22.027 --> 14:24.763
The fair
Lady Baden-Baden and I

14:24.763 --> 14:27.967
have come to a
partin' of the ways.

14:27.967 --> 14:30.669
Our marriage is over.

14:31.537 --> 14:33.806
I'll be staying
in the back bedroom.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.941
You don't mind, do you sir?

14:35.941 --> 14:37.476
But..er.. um...

14:37.476 --> 14:39.311
but.. um...

14:39.311 --> 14:42.448
Pig 2: Oh! It's a disaster!

14:42.448 --> 14:44.483
Our first catering contract

14:44.483 --> 14:47.019
just went up in smoke!

14:47.019 --> 14:49.722
Pig 3: No, he just
went up the stairs.

14:51.523 --> 14:53.025
Pig 2: We have to get Knox and

14:53.025 --> 14:55.461
Lady Baden-Baden back together,

14:55.461 --> 14:57.830
or we can kiss our
catering contract

14:57.830 --> 15:00.499
and our holiday good bye.

15:03.969 --> 15:05.871
Lady B-B:

15:05.871 --> 15:08.340
Don't cry,
Lady Baden-Baden.

15:08.340 --> 15:11.277
Lady B-B: Oh, I'm not.
It's the onions.

15:12.611 --> 15:15.214
But I doooo miss Knoxie so.

15:15.214 --> 15:18.684
I'm sure you and
Mr. Knox can work things out.

15:18.684 --> 15:22.021
Lady B-B: You manage a career
and a marriage, Melissa.

15:22.021 --> 15:23.422
How do you do it?

15:23.422 --> 15:26.225
Well.. a
little understanding,

15:26.225 --> 15:27.593
a little support

15:27.593 --> 15:29.295
and a little compromise...

15:29.295 --> 15:30.996
From both of us.

15:30.996 --> 15:32.364
Lady B-B: Compromise?!

15:32.364 --> 15:36.201
Not one of
Knoxie's strong points.

15:36.201 --> 15:37.903
Here's your
basket of goodies for the

15:37.903 --> 15:41.106
Historical Society train ride,
Lady Baden-Baden.

15:41.106 --> 15:44.009
Um, why don't you take it
down to the station,

15:44.009 --> 15:46.011
and take the rest
of the afternoon off?

15:46.011 --> 15:48.447
Lady B-B: Ooh,
thank you, Schaeffer.

15:48.447 --> 15:51.016
Maybe, a little visit
will cheer me up.

15:51.016 --> 15:53.085
We'll walk you
down to the train station,

15:53.085 --> 15:54.787
Lady Baden-Baden.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.922
We're covering the
trip for the Standard.

15:56.922 --> 16:00.292
Lady B-B: You're too kind, Bert.
How do you do it?

16:02.594 --> 16:06.532
Pig 1: Where is she?
Where's Lady Baden-Baden?

16:06.532 --> 16:10.903
Pig 2: We..er.. Mr. Knox
bought these flowers for her.

16:11.737 --> 16:13.472
Pig 3: We want her... I mean,

16:13.472 --> 16:15.975
Mr. Knox wants her back.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.309
You're too late.

16:17.309 --> 16:19.144
She just left for
the train station.

16:19.144 --> 16:22.081
If you hurry, you might catch
her before the train leaves.

16:22.081 --> 16:23.983
Pig 2: But she can't leave!

16:23.983 --> 16:26.618
Pig 1: Ooh, no! Come on, boys.

16:26.618 --> 16:28.687
Pig 2/Pig 3: Ooooh!

16:29.722 --> 16:33.158
You're crazy to break
up with Lady Baden-Baden,

16:33.158 --> 16:35.661
just because she
took a job, Knox.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.162
Drat.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.665
But suh,
where I come from,

16:39.665 --> 16:43.902
a gentlemen would never
let his wife take a job.

16:43.902 --> 16:46.171
It's tradition.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.841
Lucky shot, Knox.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.309
The heck with tradition!

16:50.309 --> 16:52.745
You can't kiss off a
perfectly good marriage

16:52.745 --> 16:54.580
because of your
pig-headed pride!

16:54.580 --> 16:56.615
You're living in
the modern world, Knox.

16:56.615 --> 16:58.984
A woman has a right
to work, if she wants.

17:00.652 --> 17:03.455
Drrraaaat!!
Ooohhh!

17:03.455 --> 17:07.026
Besides, you shouldn't
look a gift horse in the mouth!

17:07.026 --> 17:09.228
You're getting a second
income out of it.

17:09.228 --> 17:11.697
Ha-haa! Listen, Knox,

17:11.697 --> 17:14.199
about your taking on the pigs...

17:14.199 --> 17:17.302
Oh, don't
worry about them, Sir,

17:17.302 --> 17:19.705
I'm sure they're gonna
work out fine.

17:19.705 --> 17:22.341
Oh, you do eh? Heh heh.

17:22.341 --> 17:23.976
Good. Good!

17:23.976 --> 17:25.477
Mr. Knox! Mr. Knox!

17:25.477 --> 17:28.714
Pig 1: Lady Baden-Baden's
leaving on the afternoon train.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.516
Pig 2: You've got to stop her!

17:30.516 --> 17:32.451
Pig 3: It'll just ruin
your surprise party,

17:32.451 --> 17:34.420
if she doesn't turn up.

17:34.420 --> 17:36.355
Pig 1: We'll drive
you in the limo.

17:36.355 --> 17:37.356
Let's go.

17:38.524 --> 17:40.325
Hey. What about me?

17:40.325 --> 17:42.628
That's loyalty for you.

17:42.628 --> 17:44.696
Those traitorous trotters

17:44.696 --> 17:46.532
are already working for Knox,

17:46.532 --> 17:48.500
and they haven't
even moved out yet.

17:49.034 --> 17:51.036
We'll drive you in the limo!

17:51.804 --> 17:53.705
In my limo?

17:53.705 --> 17:56.675
Hey, wait for me,
you two-timing trotters!

17:56.675 --> 17:57.843
Come back here!

17:59.511 --> 18:02.915
Lady B-B: Oh, you know, I doo
miss these social functions.

18:02.915 --> 18:06.418
But now I'm a career woman.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.620
Ooh,

18:08.620 --> 18:12.224
it's all so meaningless
without Knoxie.

18:12.224 --> 18:15.360
C'mon boys,
she's gettin' away!

18:17.196 --> 18:19.231
Who's that?
I don't know!

18:19.231 --> 18:21.767
Faster, boys, faster!!

18:21.767 --> 18:23.769
It's Mr. Knox!

18:23.769 --> 18:25.037
Sweet pea!!

18:25.037 --> 18:26.371
Knox/Pigs: Uaaaaah!

18:26.371 --> 18:30.576
Don't leave me,
I love you!

18:30.576 --> 18:33.812
Lady B-B: Knoxie,
what are you doing?

18:33.812 --> 18:35.681
I was wrong, dearest!

18:35.681 --> 18:37.082
I see that now!

18:37.082 --> 18:38.283
If you want to work,

18:38.283 --> 18:41.487
I'll stand beside
you all the way!

18:41.487 --> 18:44.623
But if you leave
on this train, honey,

18:44.623 --> 18:48.026
you'll take away my sunshine!

18:48.026 --> 18:50.095
Lady B-B: Oooh, Knoxie,

18:50.095 --> 18:53.098
you silly old romantic darling!

18:53.098 --> 18:57.369
It's just an afternoon run
with the Historical Society.

18:57.369 --> 18:58.971
Pig 1: This is embarrassing!

18:58.971 --> 19:01.540
Pig 3: I wish they'd make
up and get it over with!

19:01.540 --> 19:04.309
Pig 2: Oh I think,
it's romantic!

19:04.309 --> 19:06.211
Yahhh.

19:06.211 --> 19:07.779
Pigs/Knox: Uaaaaah!

19:07.779 --> 19:09.481
Lady B-B: Knoxieeeee!

19:09.481 --> 19:14.419
I looooveee youuuuu!

19:16.722 --> 19:18.457
Did I miss
something here?

19:18.457 --> 19:20.893
Pig 1: Yes, boss.
The happy ending!

19:22.794 --> 19:25.297
Well, we thought

19:25.297 --> 19:27.266
she was leaving for good.

19:27.266 --> 19:29.935
Pig 2: But things
worked out anyway.

19:29.935 --> 19:32.337
The anniversary
party's still on!

19:32.337 --> 19:34.740
Pig 3: And so is our contract.

19:36.375 --> 19:40.112
Look, I.. don't
want you three to go.

19:40.112 --> 19:42.214
Pig 3: Oh, but we have to!

19:42.214 --> 19:44.850
We're expected at 6:30.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.785
Don't make me beg!

19:46.785 --> 19:49.755
I'll... double Knox's contract!

19:56.628 --> 19:59.031
Pig 2: Boss...

19:59.031 --> 20:02.634
why would you want 500
servings of pink caviar?

20:02.634 --> 20:04.503
Pink what?

20:04.503 --> 20:06.605
Pig 1: C'mon. We're
going to be late!

20:08.106 --> 20:09.875
Oh no!!

20:12.044 --> 20:15.514
Pig 1: Snag ate our
entire catering contract.

20:15.514 --> 20:17.950
Pig 3: Oh, my...
What'll we tell Mr. Knox?

20:17.950 --> 20:19.785
Catering contract...

20:19.785 --> 20:23.722
You mean, you've got a
catering contract with Knox?

20:23.722 --> 20:25.791
Why you low down,

20:25.791 --> 20:29.328
half-brained, two-faced,
sniveling swine...

20:30.696 --> 20:33.498
Cyril and the Pigs
worked out their differences.

20:33.498 --> 20:34.866
They always do.

20:34.866 --> 20:39.004
And fortunately, so did
Mr. Knox and Lady Baden-Baden.

20:40.172 --> 20:44.142
♪ (singing in distance) ♪

20:44.142 --> 20:45.410
♪ Lalalalalalalala ♪

20:45.410 --> 20:48.180
Lady B-B: ..and I decided that a
part-time catering business

20:48.180 --> 20:50.682
would be the perfect compromise.

20:50.682 --> 20:55.420
I can work at home and still
attend my social functions.

20:56.688 --> 20:59.891
I hope you understand, Schaeffer.

20:59.891 --> 21:03.395
Oh, I'll get by,
Lady Baden-Baden.

21:03.395 --> 21:06.498
You realize you've
made history, dearest?

21:06.498 --> 21:11.003
The first Knox woman
to have a career.

21:12.704 --> 21:14.206
Great food, Schaeffer.

21:14.206 --> 21:17.242
I don't know how you whipped it
up on such short notice.

21:17.242 --> 21:20.345
Oh, Lady
Baden-Baden gave me a hand.

21:20.345 --> 21:23.749
Um, what did happen
to the original caterers?

21:23.749 --> 21:25.784
Pig 1: Then there's the
food from Willow's.

21:25.784 --> 21:28.720
And we owe the Blue
Spruce for catering...

21:28.720 --> 21:32.124
Pig 2: And the candy and
flowers for Lady Baden-Baden.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.059
Pig 3: And don't forget
the veterinary bill

21:34.059 --> 21:35.961
for Snag's indigestion.

21:35.961 --> 21:38.563
Pig 1: Well, enjoy
the holiday, boys.

21:38.563 --> 21:42.934
It's the last one we'll be
able to afford for years.

21:42.934 --> 21:46.305
