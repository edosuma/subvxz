WEBVTT

00:02.135 --> 00:03.363
I love these nature shows.

00:04.704 --> 00:07.104
And it's amazing
how you can always relate.

00:07.273 --> 00:09.798
You're watching the
African dung beetle and going:

00:09.976 --> 00:12.410
"Boy, his life is a lot like mine."

00:12.846 --> 00:15.747
You always root for whichever animal
is the star of the show.

00:15.915 --> 00:18.509
Like, if it's the antelope,
and a lion's chasing it...

00:18.685 --> 00:22.712
...you go, "Run, antelope, run.
Use your speed. Get away."

00:23.156 --> 00:24.953
Then next week it's the lion...

00:25.125 --> 00:28.060
...and then you go, "Get the antelope.
Eat him. Bite his ass!

00:28.228 --> 00:30.287
Trap him.
Don't let him use his speed."

00:36.269 --> 00:38.897
Well, did he bring it up
in the meeting?

00:39.072 --> 00:41.097
Elaine, see this T-shirt?

00:41.274 --> 00:44.801
Six years, I've had this T-shirt.
It's my best one.

00:44.978 --> 00:48.141
I call him Golden Boy.

00:48.848 --> 00:50.372
Yeah. I'm on the phone here.

00:50.550 --> 00:53.678
Golden Boy's always the first shirt
I wear out of the laundry. Here.

00:53.853 --> 00:56.151
Touch Golden Boy.

00:56.356 --> 00:58.551
No, thanks.
Yeah. Yeah, I'll hold.

00:58.725 --> 01:01.285
But, see, look at the collar.
It's fraying.

01:01.461 --> 01:03.986
Golden Boy is slowly dying.

01:04.431 --> 01:06.456
Each wash brings him
one step closer.

01:06.633 --> 01:08.464
That's what makes it
such a tragic figure.

01:08.635 --> 01:10.262
Why don't you just let Golden Boy...

01:10.437 --> 01:12.405
...soak in the sink with some Woolite.
-No.

01:13.406 --> 01:14.771
The reason he's the iron man...

01:14.941 --> 01:17.000
...is because he goes out
and plays every game.

01:17.177 --> 01:19.338
Wash, spin, rinse, spin.

01:19.512 --> 01:22.777
If you take that away from him,
you break his spirit.

01:22.949 --> 01:24.041
Yeah.

01:24.751 --> 01:27.515
What? He is?

01:27.687 --> 01:29.917
Oh, that's fantastic. I'm so excited.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.422
Yes, I'm excited. Okay.
Okay, I'll be in soon.

01:32.592 --> 01:35.083
Yeah, yeah, I'm coming. I'm coming.
Okay, bye.

01:35.261 --> 01:38.958
-Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer.
-The guy who was in the gulag?

01:39.132 --> 01:42.124
Yeah. Pendant's publishing his new
book and I'm gonna work on it.

01:42.302 --> 01:45.931
Lippman and I are gonna go to the
airport and pick him up in a limousine.

01:46.506 --> 01:48.701
You wanna borrow Golden Boy?

01:49.109 --> 01:51.942
Do you know what this means?
It's like working with Tolstoy.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.637
I read an unbelievable thing
about Tolstoy the other day.

01:54.814 --> 01:57.180
Did you know the original title
for <i>War and Peace...</i>

01:57.350 --> 01:59.215
...was <i>War</i>... <i>What is it Good For?</i>

02:02.222 --> 02:04.622
No, I'm not kidding, Elaine. It's true.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.850
His mistress didn't like the title...

02:07.026 --> 02:09.119
...and insisted he change it
to <i>War and Peace.</i>

02:09.294 --> 02:13.197
-But it's a line from that song.
-That's where they got it from.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.525
-Really?
-I'm not joking.

02:19.572 --> 02:22.405
You can't handle the truth.

02:23.510 --> 02:24.977
What?

02:25.578 --> 02:28.706
I'm working on my Jack Nicholson.

02:29.015 --> 02:31.540
You can't handle the truth.

02:34.521 --> 02:36.216
-What is this, your mail?
-Yeah.

02:36.389 --> 02:39.324
I grabbed it on the way out.
I don't want my mother reading it.

02:39.492 --> 02:40.754
Your alumni magazine.

02:40.927 --> 02:43.293
-Your mother reads your mail?
-Yeah.

02:43.463 --> 02:47.160
-What do you mean, like postcards?
-No. Anything.

02:47.734 --> 02:50.100
-She doesn't open.
-She'll open.

02:50.703 --> 02:53.103
You've caught your mother
opening envelopes?

02:53.273 --> 02:54.865
-Yes.
-What does she say?

02:55.041 --> 02:57.168
"I was curious."

02:57.944 --> 03:01.539
-Isn't that against the law?
-Maybe I can get her locked up.

03:02.916 --> 03:05.783
Hey, Jerry, you're in the alumni
magazine. Listen to this:

03:05.952 --> 03:07.943
"Jerry Seinfeld has appeared...

03:08.121 --> 03:10.521
...on <i>David Letterman</i>
and <i>The Tonight Show...</i>

03:10.924 --> 03:14.690
...and he did a pilot
for NBC called <i>Jerry...</i>

03:14.861 --> 03:16.886
...that was not picked up."

03:19.465 --> 03:22.195
Georgie, how come there's not
anything about you in here?

03:22.368 --> 03:24.700
He can't handle the truth.

03:26.005 --> 03:29.202
All right, this is too much fun.
I gotta get back to work.

03:34.581 --> 03:35.843
You all right?

03:36.015 --> 03:37.448
Yeah.

03:37.617 --> 03:39.050
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.483
Yeah. Oh, hey, wait, wait.

03:42.488 --> 03:45.389
Maybe you could use this.

03:45.692 --> 03:47.182
Yeah.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.453
It's an electronic organizer.

03:49.963 --> 03:52.124
-What?
-Yeah.

03:52.298 --> 03:53.959
-What..?
-Yeah, here.

03:54.133 --> 03:55.657
Yeah. You know...

03:55.835 --> 03:59.168
...for phone numbers, addresses,
keep appointments, everything.

03:59.339 --> 04:01.534
Yeah, it's got an alarm that beeps.

04:01.708 --> 04:04.006
Oh, I can't believe this, Kramer.

04:04.177 --> 04:07.442
I've been wanting to get one of
these things. Are you sure that..?

04:08.982 --> 04:10.574
-Sure you can't use this thing?
-No.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.082
I got all my appointments
right up here.

04:14.120 --> 04:17.112
-Where'd you get this?
-The bank. I opened a new account.

04:19.192 --> 04:21.625
Hey, did you see that whale thing
on TV last night?

04:21.793 --> 04:23.022
No.

04:23.196 --> 04:24.754
I am such a huge whale fan.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.588
These marine biologists showed...

04:26.766 --> 04:29.564
...how they communicate
with the squeaks and the squeals.

04:29.736 --> 04:31.499
-What a fish.
-It's a mammal.

04:31.704 --> 04:34.400
Whatever. Hey, new tape recorder?

04:34.574 --> 04:36.542
Yeah, I got it from the bank.

04:36.876 --> 04:38.104
-Hey.
-Hey.

04:38.278 --> 04:41.645
Who wants to have some fun?

04:41.914 --> 04:43.381
-I do.
-I do.

04:43.549 --> 04:47.952
Now, are you just saying that,
or do you really wanna have fun?

04:48.121 --> 04:49.520
I really wanna have fun.

04:49.689 --> 04:51.816
I'm just saying
I wanna have some fun.

04:52.992 --> 04:56.086
Right now, there are 600 Titleists...

04:56.262 --> 05:00.722
...that I got from the driving range
in the trunk of my car.

05:01.301 --> 05:04.099
Why don't we drive out
to Rockaway...

05:04.270 --> 05:06.033
...and hit them...

05:06.205 --> 05:08.332
...into the ocean!

05:08.574 --> 05:12.374
Now picture this. We find a nice,
sweet spot between the dunes...

05:12.545 --> 05:15.810
...we take out our drivers,
we tee up, and:

05:16.316 --> 05:19.217
That ball goes sailing up
into the sky...

05:19.385 --> 05:22.843
...holds there for a moment,
and then:

05:27.593 --> 05:29.584
-You wanna get some lunch?
-Yeah.

05:29.762 --> 05:32.162
Let me stop by the cash machine,
and I'll meet you.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.232
Yeah, I'm gonna get a paper.

05:35.234 --> 05:37.498
-Keep your head down.
-Yeah.

05:41.474 --> 05:43.203
Cash advance? Yes.

05:43.376 --> 05:46.345
No. Balance inquiry?

05:46.512 --> 05:48.002
No.

05:48.614 --> 05:50.548
Receipt? No.

05:50.717 --> 05:53.413
Processing, processing.

05:56.055 --> 05:57.647
I won.

05:58.424 --> 06:00.119
Jerry?

06:00.626 --> 06:02.218
-Yeah.
-It's Diane.

06:02.395 --> 06:05.296
-Diane DeConn from Queens College.
-Oh, Diane.

06:05.465 --> 06:07.126
-How are you?
-Good.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.097
-Good.
-How long has it been?

06:09.268 --> 06:10.860
Since college.

06:11.337 --> 06:13.305
I've seen you on TV.
You're doing great.

06:13.473 --> 06:16.033
-Yeah, plugging along.
-I got the alumni magazine.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.642
What ever happened to George?

06:17.810 --> 06:19.641
I notice I never see his name
in there.

06:19.812 --> 06:21.404
Well, he's kind of modest.

06:22.014 --> 06:25.040
He was always such a goof-off.
I mean, did he ever get anywhere?

06:25.218 --> 06:28.210
-Sure.
-Yeah? What field?

06:29.322 --> 06:30.721
Marine biology.

06:31.357 --> 06:32.881
George is a marine biologist?

06:33.126 --> 06:34.787
Yeah. Pretty damn good one too.

06:35.828 --> 06:37.056
I can't believe it.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.256
-I would never have thought.
-Yeah. He's specializing in whales.

06:40.433 --> 06:43.960
He's working on lowering
the cholesterol level in whales.

06:44.137 --> 06:46.537
All that blubber. It's quite unhealthy.

06:46.706 --> 06:49.470
It's the largest mammal
on Earth, but as George says...

06:49.642 --> 06:51.109
...they don't have to be.

06:53.813 --> 06:55.576
Diane DeConn?

06:55.748 --> 06:57.443
You saw Diane DeConn?

06:57.617 --> 06:59.608
-Something, huh?
-How did she look?

06:59.786 --> 07:01.811
She looked great.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.014
She asked about you.

07:04.190 --> 07:06.090
She asked about me?
What did she say?

07:07.026 --> 07:08.755
"How's George?"

07:09.762 --> 07:12.856
George? She said George?

07:13.032 --> 07:14.363
She remembered my name.

07:14.667 --> 07:16.931
Diane DeConn
remembered my name.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.764
She was the "it" girl.

07:20.006 --> 07:23.442
She asked for your number. I think
she's gonna get in touch with you.

07:26.479 --> 07:28.242
Okay, I'm telling you right now...

07:28.414 --> 07:31.747
...if you're kidding, I'm not gonna
be able to be your friend anymore.

07:31.918 --> 07:33.783
I'm serious about that. You got that?

07:33.953 --> 07:36.285
-I got no problem with that.
-Good.

07:36.456 --> 07:39.323
Because if this is a lie,
if this is a joke...

07:39.492 --> 07:43.121
...if this is your idea of some
cute little game, we're finished.

07:43.763 --> 07:45.390
Expect a call.

07:46.365 --> 07:48.458
Oh, my God, he's not kidding.

07:48.868 --> 07:50.165
Now...

07:50.336 --> 07:52.327
...I should tell you...

07:56.042 --> 07:58.875
...that at this point...

07:59.312 --> 08:02.839
...she's under the impression
that you're a...

08:03.716 --> 08:06.514
-A what?
-A marine biologist.

08:12.124 --> 08:14.718
-A marine biologist?
-Yes.

08:15.261 --> 08:16.660
Why am I a marine biologist?

08:18.831 --> 08:21.231
I may have mentioned it.

08:22.235 --> 08:24.328
But I'm not a marine biologist.

08:24.704 --> 08:26.535
Yes, I know that.

08:27.139 --> 08:28.538
So?

08:28.841 --> 08:31.002
Why, you don't think
it's a good job?

08:31.177 --> 08:33.804
I didn't even know it was a job.

08:35.280 --> 08:38.010
Oh, it's a fascinating field.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.452
Well, what if she calls me?

08:40.620 --> 08:43.111
What am I supposed to say?

08:45.992 --> 08:47.289
Algae.

08:47.493 --> 08:49.393
Obviously plankton.

08:50.429 --> 08:52.454
I don't know what else
I could tell you.

08:52.632 --> 08:55.123
I just got back from a trip
to the Galápagos Islands.

08:55.301 --> 08:56.632
I was living with turtles.

08:57.770 --> 09:00.466
We have got you
in a very nice hotel.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.699
I don't know how you like to work...

09:02.875 --> 09:05.810
...but I can arrange
for an office if you like.

09:05.978 --> 09:08.572
-I work in hotel. Is better.
-In the hotel.

09:08.748 --> 09:11.012
Away from all your
little petty bickerings...

09:11.183 --> 09:13.276
...and interference.

09:13.452 --> 09:16.944
You know, Tolstoy used to write
in the village square.

09:17.123 --> 09:18.750
The faces inspired him.

09:19.191 --> 09:22.160
He did not need inspiration.

09:22.328 --> 09:25.661
God spoke through his pen.

09:25.965 --> 09:27.626
-That is so true.
-Yes.

09:27.800 --> 09:31.429
Although, one wonders
if <i>War and Peace</i> would have been...

09:31.604 --> 09:35.301
...as highly acclaimed, had it been
published under its original title...

09:35.474 --> 09:38.068
<i>... War</i>... <i>What is it Good For?</i>

09:38.544 --> 09:39.909
-What?
-Yeah.

09:40.079 --> 09:42.741
Mr. Lippman, it was his mistress
who insisted...

09:42.915 --> 09:45.406
...that he call it <i>War and Peace.</i>
-Elaine, Elaine.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.018
<i>War</i>... <i>What is it Good For?</i>

09:47.186 --> 09:50.587
<i>Absolutely nothing
Say it again</i>

09:50.756 --> 09:53.384
-Elaine.
-It's a song. They took it from Tolstoy.

09:53.559 --> 09:55.527
-No. Elaine.
-<i>War...</i>

09:55.695 --> 09:57.993
-<i>... What is it Good For?</i>
-It's her sense of humor.

09:58.164 --> 10:00.462
-No, it's not. That is true.
-What is that noise?

10:00.633 --> 10:02.965
-No, it's not.
-That noise!

10:03.135 --> 10:06.434
What is that noise? It's traveling
up my spine, into my brain.

10:06.606 --> 10:10.167
-It's coming from your purse.
-It must be my new organizer.

10:10.343 --> 10:11.776
-That noise.
-Turn it off.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.504
-Right. I think it's this...
-I cannot stand it.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.375
-It's the button at the top.
-Okay.

10:16.549 --> 10:19.484
-Will you turn it off?
-Not the... The one at the top.

10:19.652 --> 10:20.949
Give it to me.

10:22.000 --> 10:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:33.566 --> 10:34.794
I did it for you.

10:34.967 --> 10:36.901
I don't know why
you had to tell her that.

10:37.069 --> 10:40.596
You put me in a very difficult
position. Marine biologist.

10:40.773 --> 10:43.139
I'm very uncomfortable
with this whole thing.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.834
I would think it's right up your alley.

10:46.012 --> 10:47.536
Well, it's not up my alley.

10:47.747 --> 10:50.307
It's one thing if I make it up,
I know what I'm doing.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.474
I know my alleys.

10:53.285 --> 10:55.947
You got me in the Galápagos Islands
living with the turtles.

10:56.122 --> 10:57.646
I don't know where the hell I am.

10:58.524 --> 11:00.924
You came in the other day
with all that whale stuff...

11:01.093 --> 11:02.651
...the squeaking and the squealing.

11:02.828 --> 11:05.194
Look, why couldn't you
make me an architect?

11:05.364 --> 11:08.026
You know I always wanted to pretend
I was an architect.

11:10.136 --> 11:12.161
Well, I'm supposed
to see her tomorrow.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.272
I'm gonna tell her what's going on.

11:14.473 --> 11:17.533
I mean, maybe she
just likes me for me.

11:18.110 --> 11:19.236
-Hey.
-Hey.

11:19.412 --> 11:21.073
You want these?

11:21.814 --> 11:23.714
I don't want them.

11:25.451 --> 11:28.386
-Why?
-I stink!

11:29.055 --> 11:30.283
I can't play.

11:30.456 --> 11:33.584
The ball is just sitting there, Jerry,
and I can't hit it.

11:33.759 --> 11:36.626
I only hit one really good ball
that went way out there.

11:36.796 --> 11:40.254
-Well, what happened?
-I have no concentration.

11:42.168 --> 11:45.934
-What's wrong with your..?
-Sand. I can't get rid of the sand.

11:46.105 --> 11:51.168
Look at this. Look, there's still some
in here. It won't go away.

11:51.343 --> 11:55.404
-Look, I even got sand in the pockets.
-You're getting it all over the floor.

11:59.318 --> 12:00.808
Hello.

12:00.986 --> 12:03.921
Yeah. Yes, it is.

12:04.090 --> 12:05.682
Really?

12:06.659 --> 12:08.889
Could you hold on a second?
Hey, listen to this.

12:09.061 --> 12:11.552
A woman found an electronic
organizer. My name's in it.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.131
-She wants help finding the owner.
-How'd she find it?

12:14.300 --> 12:17.497
She's walking down the street
and it hit her in the head.

12:23.008 --> 12:25.101
So I am walking along...

12:25.277 --> 12:27.802
...minding my own business,
when all of a sudden...

12:27.980 --> 12:30.244
...this thing comes flying
out of nowhere...

12:30.416 --> 12:32.475
...and clonks me
right on the head.

12:32.651 --> 12:33.675
Yeah.

12:33.853 --> 12:36.083
-So they took me to the hospital.
-Yeah.

12:36.255 --> 12:39.691
Yeah. And they put me in this thing
that feels like a coffin...

12:39.859 --> 12:42.020
...for 45 minutes.

12:42.194 --> 12:45.630
You ever been in one of those things?
You could go berserk in there.

12:45.798 --> 12:47.527
-Well, you have insurance.
-I wish.

12:47.700 --> 12:50.100
-Unbelievable.
-Yeah.

12:50.269 --> 12:52.737
-What is with this thing?
-It never shuts up.

12:52.905 --> 12:55.567
So anyway, you could see
why I would be interested...

12:55.741 --> 12:57.800
...in finding this person.
-Absolutely.

12:58.010 --> 13:00.376
You should not have to pay for that.

13:00.546 --> 13:02.810
Stop it. Stop it!

13:02.982 --> 13:04.244
Let me look at this thing.

13:04.416 --> 13:07.613
Somebody told me they thought
they saw it come out of a limousine.

13:07.787 --> 13:11.689
Typical rich people using the world
for their personal garbage can.

13:11.957 --> 13:16.155
Boy, am I lucky your name came up.
I just pushed a button.

13:16.328 --> 13:19.195
I want to know what my name's
doing in this creep's organizer.

13:19.365 --> 13:20.525
-Yeah.
-Who do I know...

13:20.699 --> 13:23.998
...who would have even been
in a limousine yesterday?

13:28.974 --> 13:31.636
-Oh, hey.
-Hey. Great organizer you gave me.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.244
You liked it, huh?

13:33.412 --> 13:35.175
It wouldn't stop beeping in the car...

13:35.347 --> 13:37.713
...so Testikov threw it
out the window.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.179
I transferred everything in there.

13:40.352 --> 13:43.549
I threw out my old book.
I'm lost now, Kramer.

13:44.590 --> 13:48.492
-What? What is it?
-The sand. It's everywhere.

13:48.928 --> 13:50.987
Okay, I'll see you later.

13:51.730 --> 13:54.028
-Oh, there you are.
-There you are.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.428
-So?
-So?

13:55.601 --> 13:59.230
-What do you have to say for yourself?
-What do you have to say for yourself?

13:59.405 --> 14:02.033
Why should I say anything
for myself?

14:02.675 --> 14:04.575
<i>War</i>... <i>What is it Good For?</i>

14:07.947 --> 14:09.778
Who told you?

14:11.016 --> 14:12.779
Yuri Testikov...

14:12.952 --> 14:16.718
...the Russian writer. Hello?

14:17.857 --> 14:19.688
You told Testikov...

14:21.427 --> 14:23.486
...that Tolstoy wanted
to name his book...

14:23.662 --> 14:26.222
<i>... War</i>... <i>What is it Good For?</i>

14:28.400 --> 14:30.231
And do you know what happened?

14:30.603 --> 14:33.697
-Can I take a guess?
-Oh, please.

14:33.906 --> 14:38.343
Oh, I don't know. He threw
your organizer out the window?

14:38.510 --> 14:40.671
What? How do you know that?

14:40.880 --> 14:43.576
-Because I know who has it.
-How did you find it?

14:43.749 --> 14:46.980
The woman who got hit with it found
my name, called me, and we met.

14:47.186 --> 14:49.780
-Where is it? Give it to me.
-I don't have it.

14:50.189 --> 14:51.952
-Why not?
-She's not returning it...

14:52.124 --> 14:54.820
...until she gets the money back
for the hospital bill.

14:54.994 --> 14:57.929
But I didn't do it.
Testikov did it. He should pay for it.

14:58.130 --> 15:00.724
How much is Testikov
getting from Pendant for this book?

15:00.900 --> 15:03.528
-One million.
-Well, that's a start.

15:04.303 --> 15:05.930
Then, of course, with evolution...

15:06.105 --> 15:07.936
...the octopus lost the nostrils...

15:08.107 --> 15:11.008
...and took on the more familiar look
that we know today.

15:11.176 --> 15:12.438
-Really?
-Yeah.

15:12.611 --> 15:16.047
But if you still look closely,
you can see a little bump...

15:16.215 --> 15:18.308
...where the nose used to be.

15:18.984 --> 15:21.145
But enough about fish.

15:21.320 --> 15:23.254
I can discuss other things,
you know.

15:23.422 --> 15:24.855
Architecture.

15:25.391 --> 15:27.484
-You know what room Testikov's in?
-Yeah...

15:27.660 --> 15:30.959
...308. I'm crazy for doing this.

15:31.130 --> 15:33.826
Well, you want your organizer back,
don't you?

15:33.999 --> 15:36.024
Why are you so interested?

15:36.201 --> 15:38.829
-You wanna take her out?
-When Superman saves someone...

15:39.004 --> 15:41.734
...nobody asks if he's trying
to hit on her.

15:41.907 --> 15:44.808
-Well, you're not Superman.
-Well, you're not Lois Lane.

15:46.679 --> 15:49.773
-You got the tape recorder?
-Yeah. You sure you wanna do this?

15:49.949 --> 15:52.440
I gotta get Testikov on tape.
If this woman ends up...

15:52.618 --> 15:56.247
...in the <i>New England Journal of
Medicine</i>, I'm not gonna pay for it.

15:56.422 --> 15:58.549
Oh, here she comes.

15:59.458 --> 16:00.686
-Hi.
-Hi.

16:00.859 --> 16:02.121
Elaine, this is Corinne.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.728
-Hello.
-Hi. You got the organizer?

16:06.465 --> 16:09.662
Let's go. We'll meet you in 10
minutes, hopefully with the money.

16:10.736 --> 16:13.068
Your parents must be
so proud of you, George.

16:13.238 --> 16:15.502
Oh, they're busting.

16:16.775 --> 16:19.005
What are those people
doing over there?

16:22.614 --> 16:25.674
What? Come in.
Come in, Miss Benes.

16:25.851 --> 16:29.412
That is, if you can spare a minute
from your busy schedule.

16:29.588 --> 16:32.182
Now do you bring guest
for my entertainment?

16:32.358 --> 16:34.258
Yeah, this is my friend Jerry.

16:34.426 --> 16:35.859
He accompanied me.

16:36.028 --> 16:38.724
Single women in a big city
can be dangerous, so...

16:38.897 --> 16:43.857
That's why I wear these sneakers.
In case of any trouble, zip, I'm gone.

16:44.036 --> 16:47.699
Yeah, yeah. The sneakers.
All the Americans with the sneakers.

16:47.873 --> 16:50.034
You're always running
from something.

16:50.209 --> 16:51.938
Yeah, yeah. Well, sit. Stop running.

16:52.745 --> 16:55.509
Two minutes,
I give you latest manuscript.

16:56.482 --> 16:58.382
Oh, <i>Rimsky.</i>

16:58.550 --> 17:01.110
Great, great book,
if I may say so, sir.

17:01.286 --> 17:03.754
I almost read the whole thing.

17:06.157 --> 17:08.718
-What?
-If you can't turn that thing off...

17:08.894 --> 17:10.656
...I'll have to ask you to leave.

17:10.829 --> 17:14.265
-I'm waiting for two people.
-Well, you can wait for them outside.

17:14.433 --> 17:16.025
Yeah, I guess I'd better.

17:16.201 --> 17:19.465
I wouldn't wanna take any attention
away from the hookers.

17:20.239 --> 17:23.299
All right. All right. Out. Out.

17:23.608 --> 17:26.544
Whatever you say, Crowell.

17:30.516 --> 17:31.813
What's going on over here?

17:31.984 --> 17:33.679
There's a beached whale.
She's dying.

17:33.852 --> 17:36.320
Is anyone here a marine biologist?

17:41.894 --> 17:43.452
Here is latest draft.

17:43.629 --> 17:46.564
I see you next week,
same time, same day.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.563
-On time, please.
-Okay.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.964
It was nice meeting you.
You're a real pleasure.

17:51.136 --> 17:52.398
Yeah, yeah.

17:54.907 --> 17:58.001
Oh, by the way, Mr. Testikov...

17:58.444 --> 18:02.437
...do you remember the other day
when we were in the limo and...

18:02.614 --> 18:07.278
...my organizer started making noise,
and you threw it out the window?

18:07.453 --> 18:08.920
Yes. How can I forget?

18:10.189 --> 18:14.592
Well, would you believe that
it actually hit somebody in the head?

18:14.760 --> 18:16.751
Right in the head.

18:18.397 --> 18:20.092
What is that noise?

18:20.566 --> 18:22.261
That's nothing.

18:22.434 --> 18:24.868
-And anyway...
-What's going on?

18:25.471 --> 18:27.530
-That noise.
-No, no. That's my purse.

18:27.706 --> 18:29.799
-That noise.
-No. Get off my purse.

18:29.975 --> 18:31.966
-It's a recorder!
-No, that's... Radio.

18:32.144 --> 18:33.611
You are spying on me.

18:55.334 --> 18:57.234
-Save the whale.
-You've got to do it.

18:57.402 --> 18:59.370
Save the whale, George.

18:59.538 --> 19:01.096
For me.

19:18.557 --> 19:21.287
<i>So I started to walk into the water.</i>

19:22.528 --> 19:24.462
<i>I won't lie to you, boys.</i>

19:24.696 --> 19:26.459
I was terrified.

19:27.166 --> 19:30.329
But I pressed on. And as I made
my way past the breakers...

19:30.502 --> 19:32.436
...a strange calm came over me.

19:32.604 --> 19:35.630
I don't know if it was
divine intervention...

19:35.807 --> 19:37.900
...but I tell you, Jerry,
at that moment...

19:38.644 --> 19:40.441
...I was a marine biologist.

19:42.748 --> 19:45.239
George, I've just been reading
this thing in the paper.

19:45.417 --> 19:48.113
-It's unbelievable.
-I know. I was just telling the story.

19:48.287 --> 19:50.187
Well, come on, George.
Finish the story.

19:52.057 --> 19:54.855
The sea was angry that day,
my friends.

19:57.462 --> 20:00.397
Like an old man trying
to send back soup in a deli.

20:06.838 --> 20:09.602
I got about 50 feet out,
when suddenly...

20:09.775 --> 20:12.710
...the great beast
appeared before me.

20:12.878 --> 20:15.870
I tell you, he was 10 stories high
if he was a foot.

20:16.782 --> 20:19.945
As if sensing my presence,
he let out a great bellow.

20:20.118 --> 20:22.086
I said, "Easy, big fella."

20:24.089 --> 20:27.286
And then, as I watched
him struggling, I realized...

20:27.459 --> 20:29.723
...that something was obstructing
its breathing.

20:29.895 --> 20:33.023
From where I was standing, I could
see into the eye of the great fish.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.063
-Mammal.
-Whatever.

20:36.535 --> 20:38.400
-What did you do next?
-Well, then...

20:38.570 --> 20:41.437
...from out of nowhere,
a huge tidal wave lifted me...

20:41.607 --> 20:44.667
...tossed me like a cork,
and I found myself on top of him...

20:44.843 --> 20:47.471
...face to face with the blowhole.

20:47.646 --> 20:50.706
I could barely see from the waves
crashing down upon me...

20:50.882 --> 20:53.077
...but I knew something was there.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.879
So I reached my hand in...

20:55.053 --> 20:58.750
...felt around, and pulled out
the obstruction.

21:18.877 --> 21:20.276
What is that, a Titleist?

21:24.549 --> 21:26.483
A hole in one, huh?

21:35.894 --> 21:39.591
-The crowd must have gone wild.
-Oh, yes, yes.

21:40.232 --> 21:42.496
Yes, Jerry. They were all over me.

21:42.668 --> 21:44.727
It was like <i>Rocky I.</i>

21:46.571 --> 21:48.004
Diane came up to me...

21:48.774 --> 21:50.742
...threw her arms around me...

21:50.909 --> 21:52.308
...kissed me.

21:53.245 --> 21:56.442
We both had tears
streaming down our faces.

21:57.115 --> 21:59.549
I never saw anyone so beautiful.

22:00.519 --> 22:03.545
It was at that moment
that I decided to tell her...

22:03.722 --> 22:06.816
...that I was not a marine biologist.

22:07.926 --> 22:08.915
What did she say?

22:09.094 --> 22:12.029
Told me to go to hell
and I took the bus home.

22:12.197 --> 22:14.358
All right. Let's go.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.699
-What, are you in a bad mood?
-No.

22:17.869 --> 22:19.962
Got my laundry back.

22:20.539 --> 22:23.667
-Golden Boy?
-He didn't make it.

22:25.911 --> 22:27.310
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah.

22:27.846 --> 22:29.871
This is Golden Boy's son...

22:30.082 --> 22:31.515
...Baby Blue.

22:33.285 --> 22:35.685
-What's with you?
-This sand.

22:35.921 --> 22:37.752
-It's everywhere.
-Yep.
