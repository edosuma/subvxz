[male TV host] When we
booked you for this show,

00:03.462 --> 00:06.840
you'd just won the Triple
Crown, but then just this week,

00:06.923 --> 00:09.885
I open up the newspaper,
and look at this...

00:09.968 --> 00:12.471
"Secretariat Under Investigation."

00:12.555 --> 00:13.930
What am I supposed to do with that?

00:14.014 --> 00:16.015
Maybe it's a different Secretariat.

00:16.140 --> 00:18.310
Ha ha ha ha. No, but seriously, folks,

00:18.394 --> 00:21.063
there is no truth to these allegations.

00:21.146 --> 00:23.566
I have never bet on horse racing,

00:23.649 --> 00:25.984
and I certainly did
not bet on my own races.

00:26.068 --> 00:28.111
Although I did bet the
network's gonna give your show

00:28.195 --> 00:29.488
back to Joey Bishop.

00:29.572 --> 00:31.281
O... ho ho... kay.

00:31.365 --> 00:34.159
We get letters here on the
show, and one particular letter,

00:34.243 --> 00:37.413
for you, actually, struck
a chord with our producers.

00:37.496 --> 00:40.499
This is from BoJack H.
BoJack is nine years old.

00:40.583 --> 00:42.752
BoJack writes, "Dear Secretariat,

00:42.834 --> 00:44.795
I am a horse just like you.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.339
I like to watch racing, and
you are my favorite racer."

00:47.423 --> 00:48.882
Smart kid.

00:48.965 --> 00:50.634
"When I grow up, I want
to be just like you,

00:50.718 --> 00:52.469
and I think I'm on the right track.

00:52.553 --> 00:55.389
Get it? Track, because
horses run on tracks,

00:55.472 --> 00:57.140
and you are a horse, and I am a horse.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.602
Do you get it? Do you get
my joke about the track?"

00:59.685 --> 01:01.604
Okay, there's a whole page of this.

01:01.687 --> 01:03.480
Should I write him back
and tell him I get it?

01:03.564 --> 01:05.566
He goes on, "My question for you is,

01:05.649 --> 01:07.568
I am a good kid, and I like to play,

01:07.651 --> 01:10.904
and I like to go to school,
but sometimes I get sad.

01:10.987 --> 01:12.740
What do you do when you get sad?

01:12.823 --> 01:15.451
How do you not be sad? Sincerely, BoJack."

01:15.534 --> 01:17.202
That's a great letter.

01:17.286 --> 01:20.497
BoJack, when I was your age, I got sad.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.124
A lot.

01:22.207 --> 01:24.794
I didn't come from such a great home,

01:24.876 --> 01:28.297
but one day, I started running,
and that seemed to make sense,

01:28.380 --> 01:30.549
so then I just kept running.

01:30.633 --> 01:34.303
BoJack, when you get sad,
you run straight ahead

01:34.386 --> 01:36.722
and you keep running
forward, no matter what.

01:36.806 --> 01:38.557
There are people in your life

01:38.641 --> 01:40.476

you back, slow you down,

01:40.559 --> 01:41.769
but you don't let them.

01:41.852 --> 01:44.229
Don't you stop running and
don't you ever look behind you.

01:44.313 --> 01:46.565
There's nothing for you behind you.

You can't cheat in sports

make a wonderful movie.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.699
Fantastic.

09:34.783 --> 09:38.828
But I also have this other
non-movie-related idea.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.330
Ooh, let's hear the other idea.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.082
Okay. I was heading down Wilshire,

09:42.165 --> 09:45.210
and I saw this empty
store front, and I thought,

09:45.294 --> 09:47.212
"You know what this world needs?"

09:47.296 --> 09:48.880
Edge of my seat over here.

09:48.964 --> 09:52.592
A store where people
can buy Halloween stuff.

09:52.675 --> 09:55.470
Halloween store. Feel
like that's been done.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.388
Yeah, in October,

09:57.472 --> 10:00.934
but how come your never see
a Halloween store in January?

10:01.017 --> 10:03.228
- It's an untapped market.
- Yeah.

10:03.312 --> 10:05.605
A Halloween store that's open year-round.

10:05.688 --> 10:08.108
- No, no. Just January.
- Brilliant.

10:08.191 --> 10:11.153
That's the kind of idea
that wins Golden Globes.

10:14.030 --> 10:16.158
I actually think the time
is right for "Secretariat,"

10:16.241 --> 10:18.451
so what do you want to
play, like, Secretariat's dad

10:18.534 --> 10:21.204
or his grandfather, maybe
like an elderly witch doctor

10:21.288 --> 10:23.206
who puts a curse on him or something?

10:23.290 --> 10:25.458
Lenny, look, I know I'm a
little long in the tooth,

10:25.541 --> 10:27.252
but I think that you more than anyone

10:27.336 --> 10:29.629
would know not to count out an old pro.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.464
Don't play the ageism card with me, kid.

10:31.547 --> 10:33.883
I've laid farts that lasted
longer than your entire career.

10:33.967 --> 10:37.137
But Secretariat was dead at
27, so who we kidding here?

10:37.220 --> 10:39.097
Just set the project up
and give me an audition.

10:39.181 --> 10:40.598
- That's all I ask.
- All right.

10:40.682 --> 10:42.100
You got yourself a "go" picture, kid.

10:42.184 --> 10:44.102
And by you, I mean me. And by "go" picture,

10:44.186 --> 10:46.355
I mean I'll make some phone
calls, we'll see what I can do.

10:46.437 --> 10:49.649
And by kid, I mean middle-aged adult.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.695
[whispers] Shh. No, no, no.
Put it here. Put it here.

10:53.778 --> 10:56.031
- [whispers] Okay, I'll do it.
- Ahem.

10:56.114 --> 10:59.326
- Has this ever happened to you?
- Has what ever happened to me?

10:59.409 --> 11:02.371
- Todd?
- Yes, Mr. Peanutbutter?

11:02.453 --> 11:04.373
What's going on? Why are
you talking like that?

11:04.455 --> 11:06.333
Todd, I just got a phenomenal idea

11:06.416 --> 11:08.043
for a Halloween costume.

11:08.126 --> 11:10.170
Why don't you and I dash
over to the store right quick

11:10.253 --> 11:12.547
and spend some hard-earned American money?

11:12.630 --> 11:15.508
Oh, but, Mr. Peanutbutter, didn't you hear?

11:15.591 --> 11:18.511
It's January, and the
Halloween store won't open

11:18.594 --> 11:21.139
for another nine months.

11:21.223 --> 11:23.599
But I want satisfaction now.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.977
Has this ever happened to you?

11:26.061 --> 11:28.021
Not to anyone ever at any time.

11:28.104 --> 11:31.774
Ahem. We give you Halloween in January,

11:31.858 --> 11:34.903
a truly immersive Halloween experience

11:34.986 --> 11:37.030
for the rest of us.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.741
Halloween in January? Please elaborate.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.993
Okay, but before I do, tell the audience.

11:42.077 --> 11:44.329
- Have we ever met before?
- Never.

11:44.413 --> 11:48.083
Well, according to facts,
there's more suicides in January

11:48.166 --> 11:50.668
- than any other month.
- I'm getting pretty close over here.

11:50.752 --> 11:54.756
Also, there's less Halloween
stores. Coincidence?

11:54.839 --> 11:58.385
Wow, I'm convinced. This
store could save lives.

11:58.468 --> 12:00.262
Unbelievable. When your powers combine...

12:00.345 --> 12:03.848
you are somehow even more stupid
than the sum of your stupids.

12:03.932 --> 12:05.641
- Thank you.
- Go on.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.103
You stop encouraging him
and you stop encouraging him.

12:08.186 --> 12:09.896
The two of you are playing with fire.

12:09.979 --> 12:12.190
A fire called Having a Good Idea.

12:12.274 --> 12:14.943
Or maybe a fire called Friendship.

12:15.026 --> 12:17.862
- Fires aren't called things.
- What about the Chicago fire?

12:17.946 --> 12:19.239
Or Fire Island.

12:19.322 --> 12:20.990
- Or Gabe.
- Who's Gabe?

12:21.074 --> 12:22.951
Just a fire I met once. Named him Gabe.

12:23.034 --> 12:24.953
- He sounds delightful.
- He was. Good guy.

12:25.036 --> 12:26.537
[groans]

12:31.918 --> 12:34.796
Business, business, business.
Is that all you ever think about?

12:34.879 --> 12:36.089
I don't know.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.091
What's under that coat, Vincent?

12:38.174 --> 12:40.802
- You need to let me in.
- Not right now.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.678
I have to call the guy at the office

12:42.762 --> 12:44.722
and take the car to the place.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.475
It's always guys in places with you.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.768
You know, I thought I
wanted to date a real adult,

12:48.851 --> 12:50.853
but I'm actually young at heart.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.189
I need to feel the grass between my toes.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.733
I want to wear jeans. I want to dance.

12:55.817 --> 12:57.944
- That's baby stuff.
- No, Vincent.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.655
There's more to being an adult
than just work and business

13:00.738 --> 13:03.741
and the tall-person rides at
Disneyland. I want to have fun.

13:03.825 --> 13:06.828
There has to be a difference
between monogamy and monotony.

13:06.911 --> 13:09.247
What's mahumanunny?

13:09.331 --> 13:11.249
Well, clearly we had a
different understanding

13:11.333 --> 13:13.251
of what this was.

13:13.335 --> 13:16.212
I'd like to be an adult about
this, but frankly, I'm hurt.

13:16.296 --> 13:19.924
I think you should just go,
just git. Get out of my life.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.592
Okay.

13:21.676 --> 13:23.178
Okay.

13:23.261 --> 13:26.264
Could I have another soda?

13:28.641 --> 13:32.270
BoJack, you know Kelsey
Jannings, our director.

13:32.354 --> 13:34.523
I really appreciate you
giving me this opportunity.

13:34.605 --> 13:36.065
Yeah.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.818
Secretariat was kind of my hero as a kid.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.820
Yeah, he was a lot of people's hero.

13:40.903 --> 13:43.698
Well, you know, here was
a guy who had everything...

13:43.781 --> 13:45.783
Yeah, I know the story. I'm the director.

13:45.867 --> 13:47.702
Kelsey, be nice.

13:47.785 --> 13:49.745
She's just cranky because
she's already seen 30 people

13:49.829 --> 13:52.582
read for this today, and
we are all so goddamn sick

13:52.665 --> 13:54.792
of seeing auditions, so
whenever you're ready.

13:54.876 --> 13:56.169
Just jump right in.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.296
Great. Let's get to it.

13:58.380 --> 14:00.590
[stilted] Hey, ain't you that horse

14:00.673 --> 14:03.259
- that won all them races?
- Not today, ma'am.

14:03.343 --> 14:06.679
Today I'm just a customer
who wants a warm slice of pie.

14:06.762 --> 14:08.515
Can I ask you a question?

14:08.598 --> 14:10.517
When you're out there
on that there racetrack,

14:10.600 --> 14:12.768
- what are you running from?
- You want to know the truth?

14:12.852 --> 14:14.396
Nothing.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.647
Everyone's running from something, sugar.

14:16.731 --> 14:20.735
No, I'm running from nothing.
I'm terrified of nothing.

14:20.818 --> 14:22.820
People come up to me,
they want my autograph,

14:22.904 --> 14:24.239
they want my picture.

14:24.322 --> 14:27.033
They think they recognize something in me,

14:27.116 --> 14:30.119
and I want to be that person
they think I am, but I'm not.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.705
They see a greatness in me, and
they mistake it for goodness,

14:32.788 --> 14:35.750
but I... I know there's nothing there.

14:35.833 --> 14:40.880
As fast as I run, I
can't get way from that.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.465
- Oh.
- Wow.

14:42.549 --> 14:45.885
BoJack, I think I speak
for everyone when I say...

14:45.968 --> 14:49.931
Oh, my God, Andrew Garfield said yes.

14:50.014 --> 14:52.767
- We have our Secretariat.
- We got Andrew Garfield?

14:52.850 --> 14:54.227
Oh, my God, it's the best day of my life.

14:54.310 --> 14:55.853
[Lenny] You don't say no to Spider-Man.

14:55.937 --> 14:57.105
[Kelsey] This movie is gonna be amazing.

14:57.188 --> 14:58.314
Andrew...

14:58.398 --> 15:01.443
Garfield!

15:01.526 --> 15:04.404
Now, the pills will give you nightmares...

15:04.487 --> 15:05.696
I mean, just horrifying...

15:05.780 --> 15:07.698
but the malaria will give you death,

15:07.782 --> 15:10.076
so you're going to want
to take the pills, Diane.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.702
- Uh-huh.
- Hold on.

15:11.786 --> 15:16.040
A mosquito got into my
tent. What do you want?

15:16.124 --> 15:18.293
- [cell phone vibrates]
- Hello?

15:18.376 --> 15:20.629
Diane, it's Princess
Carolyn, BoJack's agent.

15:20.711 --> 15:22.255
Yeah, I know who you are.

15:22.338 --> 15:24.340
I'm the pink cat, the one
who used to date BoJack.

15:24.424 --> 15:27.135
We've met a lot of times.
You came to my wedding.

15:27.218 --> 15:28.637
Listen, the Turteltaub Company

15:28.719 --> 15:30.639
is making a movie about Secretariat.

15:30.721 --> 15:32.515
And since you're such an expert,

15:32.599 --> 15:35.685
they want to bring you on
board as a character consultant.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.437
What does that mean?

15:37.520 --> 15:39.063
Oh, it's the cushiest job in the world.

15:39.147 --> 15:40.982
You sit in a fancy chair
and eat pastries all day.

15:41.065 --> 15:43.943
And then once a week, you say,
"Secretariat wouldn't do that."

15:44.026 --> 15:46.070
I don't know. I've already
been offered this other thing.

15:46.154 --> 15:48.323
And did you know there
are orphans in Sudan...

15:48.406 --> 15:50.325
You take this job, you can
buy all the orphans you want.

15:50.408 --> 15:52.160
No, I don't want to buy them.

15:52.243 --> 15:54.162
Look, if you really want to help people,

15:54.245 --> 15:56.289
it doesn't hurt to have a
little money in your pocket.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.500
Take the job now, help the orphans later.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.835
- There's always later.
- Hmm.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.211
Okay, talk it over with your husband.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.005
I got to go get my whiskers trimmed.

16:04.088 --> 16:07.258
I run into walls for days, but I look hot.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.262
- How's the pie here?
- Not good.

16:11.346 --> 16:12.888
Well, I'll take all you got.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.683
Screw it. Throw it in
a bowl with some bourbon

16:14.765 --> 16:16.934
- and bring me a
ladle. - Mm-hmm.

16:17.018 --> 16:20.771
BoJack, we notice you've been
pretty down in the dumps lately,

16:20.855 --> 16:24.651
but we have something that we
think is going to cheer you up.

16:24.734 --> 16:26.695
It's an exciting new business venture

16:26.777 --> 16:29.071
that's equal parts new and exciting.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.782
Another one? What happened
to your Halloween store?

16:31.866 --> 16:33.284
- What now?
- Oh, right.

16:33.368 --> 16:35.161
The Halloween store.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.079
We took the floor out

16:37.163 --> 16:39.708
because Mr. Peanutbutter kept
scratching up the hardwood,

16:39.790 --> 16:42.585
and then... Did we ever
get the new floor installed?

16:42.669 --> 16:44.003
Uh...

16:44.086 --> 16:45.755
Halloween? In January?

16:45.838 --> 16:48.341
What a great ide... Aah!

16:48.424 --> 16:49.800
[thud]

16:49.884 --> 16:52.428
Anyway, now we're all about smoodies.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.597
- What?
- Smoodies.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.307
You're saying smoothies, right? Smoothies.

16:56.391 --> 16:57.892
No. Smoodies.

16:57.975 --> 17:00.645
It's a mood that you drink like a smoothie.

17:00.729 --> 17:03.481
I don't understand it.
How do you drink a mood?

17:03.565 --> 17:05.775
- Like a smoothie.
- So it is a smoothie.

17:05.858 --> 17:09.612
No, it's a smoodie...
A mood that you drink.

17:09.695 --> 17:13.324
- How do you drink a mood?
- Like a smoothie.

17:13.407 --> 17:16.578
But do you buy it in a store?
What're the physical attributes?

17:16.661 --> 17:18.579
We haven't worked out all the kinks yet,

17:18.663 --> 17:20.582
but the important thing
is we've gone public,

17:20.665 --> 17:22.751
and we want you to get
in on the ground floor.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.669
See, that's the problem
with all your ideas...

17:24.752 --> 17:26.755
they don't have ground floors.

17:26.837 --> 17:30.925
Finally, a Halloween store
for the rest of... Aah!

17:31.008 --> 17:32.719
[thud]

17:32.802 --> 17:34.387
[man] Hello.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.972
Anyway, our launch party's tonight,

17:37.056 --> 17:39.684
- and we'd love it if you came.
- We spared no expense...

17:39.768 --> 17:41.936
that's how confident we are in our product.

17:42.019 --> 17:43.521
- Your product... Smoodies.
- Yes.

17:43.605 --> 17:46.315
Wait, did you say smoodies or smoothies?

17:46.399 --> 17:48.443
Because we only make...
Which one do we make?

17:48.526 --> 17:50.903
I'd like to think the smoodies make us.

17:50.986 --> 17:55.116
Ahh, I can tell by your tone
that that was something smart.

17:55.199 --> 17:58.453
[hip-hop music]

17:58.536 --> 18:00.747
- Smoodie keychain?
- Smoodie cozy?

18:00.830 --> 18:02.164
Smoodie bottle opener?

18:02.248 --> 18:04.417
It's a mood that you drink like a smoothie.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.419
Todd, it is all happening.

18:06.502 --> 18:09.964
Hooray. And you know I don't
throw that word around lightly.

18:10.047 --> 18:12.425
All right. Now we just
got to make sure we focus

18:12.508 --> 18:14.385
and actually follow through on this.

18:14.469 --> 18:17.012
I'd feel awful if this
great idea fell apart

18:17.096 --> 18:19.307
because we got distracted
by something else,

18:19.390 --> 18:20.850
as we are often wont to do.

18:20.933 --> 18:24.687
Wait, did you say you
feel awful or falafel?

18:24.771 --> 18:26.439
I said, "Feel awful,"

18:26.522 --> 18:29.609
but tell me more about this falafel idea.

18:29.692 --> 18:32.737
Falafel or fawaffle?

18:32.821 --> 18:34.113
What?

18:34.196 --> 18:37.199
[dance music]

18:40.161 --> 18:44.290
BoJack, isn't this
exciting? Smoodies, right?

18:44.373 --> 18:46.835
Do you even know what a smoodie is?

18:46.917 --> 18:48.837
I think it's some kind of an adult onesie.

18:48.919 --> 18:50.963
Whatever it is, I'm trying new things.

18:51.046 --> 18:53.591
I'm single again, and I'm loving it.

18:53.675 --> 18:56.594
- Let me repeat...
- Princess Carolyn.

18:56.678 --> 18:59.806
Vincent. Well, you've got
some nerve showing your face.

18:59.889 --> 19:03.184
- I've got half a mind to...
- No, let me talk.

19:03.267 --> 19:06.145
I had a attitude problem,

19:06.228 --> 19:08.314
but then I took a timeout,

19:08.397 --> 19:10.232
and I thought about what I did.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.360
I wanted to be a big man.

19:12.443 --> 19:17.699
But sometimes the biggest thing
a man can do is tell the truth.

19:17.782 --> 19:21.118
And the truth about me is, I... I...

19:21.202 --> 19:22.829
- Okay, here we go.
- I love you.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.955
- What?
- Oh, Vincent.

19:25.039 --> 19:28.083
Let's go feel grass between our toes.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.044
- What?
- All right.

19:30.127 --> 19:32.213
You're a better man than I could ever be.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.006
I wish my boyfriend was that mature.

19:34.089 --> 19:36.091
- [groans]
- [cell phone vibrates]

19:36.175 --> 19:38.135
- Hello?
- BoJack, it's Kelsey Jannings.

19:38.219 --> 19:39.888
I got some news about "Secretariat."

19:39.970 --> 19:42.264
- What's up?
- Garfield's out.

19:42.348 --> 19:44.058
He got into some sort of accident.

19:44.141 --> 19:46.268
An All Hallows' Eve store in January?

19:46.352 --> 19:49.564
How fiendishly droll. Aah!

19:49.647 --> 19:50.981
[thud]

19:51.065 --> 19:52.650
Oh, bother.

19:52.734 --> 19:54.777
The clumsy bastard broke
every bone in his body,

19:54.861 --> 19:56.654
and now we got to find a new lead.

19:56.738 --> 19:58.823
Studio wants to go young,
but I was thinking we'd get

19:58.907 --> 20:01.784
someone a little more BoJack Horseman.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.703
What? Are you serious?

20:03.786 --> 20:05.747
You're the only one with
enough grit to play the part,

20:05.830 --> 20:08.207
and we can age you down in
post, but I'm gonna tell you now,

20:08.290 --> 20:10.501
not gonna put up with
any woe-is-me bullshit

20:10.585 --> 20:12.127
or diva histrionics.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.796
I get enough of that from my ex-wife

20:13.880 --> 20:16.173
along with newspaper
clippings about gluten.

20:16.257 --> 20:18.593
God, we get it, Marla. Gluten.

20:18.676 --> 20:21.011
But if you want to make a movie,
and you're ready to work...

20:21.095 --> 20:23.389
I am. I will. I can. I do.

20:23.472 --> 20:24.974
Great. You got one month to get in shape.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.268
You need to lose 50 pounds
and then gain back 20.

20:27.351 --> 20:28.895
- And, BoJack...
- Yeah?

20:28.978 --> 20:30.730
Don't ever call this number.

20:30.813 --> 20:32.356
If I want to talk, I'll call you.

20:32.440 --> 20:33.649
[cell phone beeps]

20:36.778 --> 20:38.905
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:38.988 --> 20:40.573
Not big on parties, huh?

20:40.656 --> 20:42.825
Nah. I never know what to do with my hands.

20:42.909 --> 20:45.327
I think I just got cast in Secretariat.

20:45.411 --> 20:48.456
- That's amazing.
- It's everything I ever wanted.

20:48.539 --> 20:51.751
- Yeah, you seem super-jazzed.
- What do I do now?

20:51.834 --> 20:54.336
Well, that's the problem with life, right?

20:54.420 --> 20:56.839
Either you know what you want,
and you don't get what you want,

20:56.923 --> 20:59.425
or get what you want, and then
you don't know what you want.

20:59.508 --> 21:02.177
- Well, that's stupid.
- Yeah.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.221
I don't know if this makes
you more or less excited,

21:04.305 --> 21:06.933
but I actually decided to take
a job on the Secretariat movie

21:07.016 --> 21:08.977
as a character consultant.

21:09.018 --> 21:11.896
Wow, so we're gonna be
working together again.

21:11.980 --> 21:13.898
Yeah. I hope you don't get sick of me.

21:13.982 --> 21:15.691
I don't think that's gonna happen.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.360
- Is it weird I took this job?
- Why would it be weird?

21:18.444 --> 21:20.822
You literally wrote
the book on Secretariat.

21:20.905 --> 21:24.533
Yeah, I know. I just...
When I first moved to L.A...

21:24.617 --> 21:27.495
I thought I was gonna be
doing really important work.

21:27.578 --> 21:29.831
You know, writing stuff
that makes a difference.

21:29.914 --> 21:33.042
But then you kind of fall into
one thing and then another...

21:33.125 --> 21:35.294
Well, you've got time.
There's always later, right?

21:35.377 --> 21:37.254
Yeah, I guess there's always later.

21:37.338 --> 21:39.381
Do you remember the last time I saw you?

21:39.465 --> 21:42.176
You asked me if I thought you
were a good person deep down?

21:42.259 --> 21:45.054
Do I remember that? Yeah, vaguely.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.598
You caught me off guard.
I didn't know what to say.

21:47.682 --> 21:51.602
Well, do you think I'm a
good person... deep down?

21:51.686 --> 21:54.229
That's the thing. I don't
think I believe in deep down.

21:54.313 --> 21:57.733
I kind of think all you are
is just the things that you do.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.862
- Well, that's depressing.
- [laughs]

22:00.945 --> 22:02.697
For what it's worth,

22:02.780 --> 22:04.615
I think your writing
does make a difference.

22:04.699 --> 22:06.158
Thanks.

22:06.241 --> 22:08.577
I really wanted you to like me, Diane.

I got so distracted by
trying to get tickets

23:16.311 --> 23:18.272
to the New Kids On The Block concert,

23:18.355 --> 23:20.983
I completely lost sight
of what's important.

23:21.067 --> 23:23.986
And I got so swept up in my
campaign for class president,

23:24.070 --> 23:26.906
I forgot why I was
