WEBVTT

00:19.762 --> 00:21.805
<i>This is so Usual Suspects.</i>

00:22.848 --> 00:26.352
Tony, your dying words will be,
''l've seen this film.''

00:26.518 --> 00:29.396
Gibbs even looks
a little bit like Gabriel Byrne.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.232
Okay. Who is Gabriel Byrne?

00:31.523 --> 00:33.692
An actor who boards
a mysterious ship like this one

00:33.859 --> 00:35.903
searching for Keyser Sose.

00:36.070 --> 00:38.113
- Another actor?
- No.

00:38.322 --> 00:42.034
Keyser Sose is a character in the film
who may or may not exist.

00:42.201 --> 00:43.911
l'm confused.

00:44.745 --> 00:47.414
So am l.
And l saw the DVD twice.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.291
<i>The Sound of Music confuses you,
probie.</i>

00:49.458 --> 00:51.210
l love that movie.

00:53.128 --> 00:55.881
One note and l will lock you
in a room and make you listen to

00:56.048 --> 00:59.468
''lt's a Small World,''
for 24 hours straight.

00:59.677 --> 01:00.844
Do we understand each other?

01:03.389 --> 01:04.640
Okay, next.

01:18.862 --> 01:20.072
ls something out of order?

01:20.322 --> 01:23.617
We have no record of Abog Galib
ever entering the United States.

01:24.493 --> 01:25.661
So?

01:26.537 --> 01:30.875
His passport has Philadelphia entry
and exit stamps. June of last year.

01:32.459 --> 01:34.253
Computer glitch?

01:36.171 --> 01:37.756
Or a forged passport.

01:38.757 --> 01:40.092
Hey.

01:54.398 --> 01:57.276
Hell, l thought we were gonna do this
without a chase.

01:57.443 --> 02:01.071
- l could not be arrested, agent.
- Gibbs.

02:01.238 --> 02:02.990
l had to speak to you alone.

02:03.157 --> 02:04.617
The situation has changed.

02:04.783 --> 02:07.453
The head of Abu Sayyaf
wants me to courier for him

02:07.745 --> 02:10.455
between Basilan and Pakistan.

02:12.458 --> 02:13.500
Bin Laden?

02:13.667 --> 02:15.544
Allah be willing.

02:15.753 --> 02:17.338
Oh, hey, sorry
if l made you run, huh.

02:17.504 --> 02:19.798
Oh, l'd chase you to hell
if it lead to Bin Laden.

02:20.007 --> 02:21.508
You only have to chase me
off the ship.

02:21.675 --> 02:24.762
Has Abu infiltrated Sealift?

02:26.305 --> 02:27.389
They are about to.

02:29.141 --> 02:33.145
Our radio man, Pinpin Pula,
is Abu Sayyaf.

02:33.312 --> 02:37.066
<i>Somehow he got a billet
on the Cape Fear.</i>

02:37.274 --> 02:39.735
<i>Well, the Cape Fear's
a Sealift-munitions transport.</i>

02:39.902 --> 02:41.278
She sails tomorrow to replenish

02:41.445 --> 02:45.491
Marine Expeditionary
Strike Force 8 in the Red Sea.

02:45.950 --> 02:47.660
<i>He plans to blow the Cape Fear</i>

02:47.826 --> 02:49.912
while it's off-loading ammo
to an assault ship.

02:50.079 --> 02:51.705
This will be as bad as 9/1 1 .

02:51.872 --> 02:53.457
And just as terrifying.

02:53.624 --> 02:55.376
Galib, that's good work.

02:56.126 --> 02:58.170
l will go off the stern,
fire a couple of rounds.

02:58.337 --> 03:00.214
Just do not hit me.

03:02.341 --> 03:04.843
Oh, my passport.

03:05.302 --> 03:07.513
l'll alert my team.
Don't want them to shoot you.

03:07.680 --> 03:09.139
No. Wait, wait.

03:13.894 --> 03:16.730
He looks from the broken coffee cup
on the floor.

03:17.356 --> 03:20.526
He looks to the photo on the wall.

03:20.693 --> 03:22.152
Looks--

04:31.856 --> 04:34.651
- What do we got?
- Blast victim. Burns and abrasions.

04:34.817 --> 04:36.069
- Pressure steady.
- Got a name?

04:36.236 --> 04:37.695
Gibbs. He's a NClS agent.

04:38.071 --> 04:40.114
All right, my count, on three.

04:40.281 --> 04:42.784
One, two, three.

04:43.576 --> 04:44.661
Agent Gibbs.

04:45.703 --> 04:46.746
<i>Agent Gunny.</i>

04:46.913 --> 04:50.500
Gunny. Gunny. Gunny.

04:52.794 --> 04:55.839
All right, get him out of his gear.
Let's go.

05:00.510 --> 05:02.679
GCS is less than eight.
Let's intubate.

05:02.846 --> 05:05.265
Twenty milligrams of etomidate.
A hundred of succinylcholine.

05:05.431 --> 05:07.267
- Doing it right away.
- Skip the X-ray.

05:07.433 --> 05:08.893
- Go straight to CAT scan.
- Call CT.

05:09.060 --> 05:11.187
Come on, baby.

05:17.026 --> 05:18.862
Ziva, what happened?

05:19.028 --> 05:21.489
A bomb. One dead, one injured.

05:21.856 --> 05:24.776
You'll need body suits, tweezers
and those suction things.

05:25.193 --> 05:26.527
Turkey basters.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.613
And many, many, many
specimen jars.

05:28.780 --> 05:30.823
- Do you get that, Mr. Palmer?
- Yes, doctor.

05:30.990 --> 05:32.617
Here, allow me.

05:32.784 --> 05:34.786
How badly is Jethro injured?

05:34.952 --> 05:36.371
Paramedics took him to emergency.

05:36.537 --> 05:37.997
Which hospital? Portsmouth?

05:38.164 --> 05:40.416
They have a level-one
trauma centre at Portsmouth.

05:40.583 --> 05:43.002
- l didn't ask.
- You didn't ask?

05:43.169 --> 05:46.464
No, once the paramedics
were on site, l had other priorities.

05:46.631 --> 05:48.424
The possibility of more bombs,
crew to detain,

05:48.591 --> 05:50.051
a crime scene to secure.

05:50.218 --> 05:52.762
Well, McGee and Tony will know.

05:52.929 --> 05:55.932
Oh, Ziva, l'm not implying
that you don't care.

05:56.099 --> 05:57.725
Listen, l know you care.

05:57.892 --> 05:59.811
l don't need reassurances,
doctor.

06:00.186 --> 06:02.855
Very well. But l just want you
to know that l know--

06:03.022 --> 06:04.232
Ducky, drip it.

06:04.399 --> 06:06.776
Do you mean drop it or zip it?

06:07.902 --> 06:11.364
American idioms
drive me up the hall.

06:11.531 --> 06:14.867
Well, actually-- Never mind.

06:15.243 --> 06:18.955
One of the crew is missing.
The radio man, Pinpin Pula.

06:19.122 --> 06:20.248
Put out a BOLO.

06:20.415 --> 06:22.834
Tony, any word on Jethro?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.712
Not yet. Portsmouth trauma
said to call back in an hour.

06:25.878 --> 06:27.338
Portsmouth. Good, good.

06:27.505 --> 06:29.424
- l'll get out that BOLO.
- We have a suspect?

06:29.590 --> 06:31.676
Pinpin Pula.
What kind of name is Pinpin?

06:31.843 --> 06:36.222
Filipino. ln Tagalog it means,
"Rice, paddy, dike.''

06:36.389 --> 06:38.391
Don't say a word.

06:39.350 --> 06:42.562
l thought that was
quite an accurate translation.

06:46.733 --> 06:49.193
Condition of Special Agent
Jethro Gibbs.

06:58.327 --> 07:00.830
Trauma One,
no condition listed yet.

07:00.997 --> 07:04.000
You can't go in there, director.
lt's restricted--

07:06.044 --> 07:07.920
to medical personnel.

07:13.009 --> 07:15.261
This isn't about turf, you know.

07:15.428 --> 07:16.763
Oh, l know that.

07:16.929 --> 07:19.223
lt's about rules.

07:19.390 --> 07:21.142
And one really big one is

07:21.309 --> 07:23.978
non-medical people
cannot enter Trauma One,

07:24.145 --> 07:26.272
unless they're carried in.

07:26.939 --> 07:28.107
Get me a gurney.

07:29.692 --> 07:32.028
That's good. ''Get me a gurney.''

07:32.737 --> 07:34.030
l like that.

07:34.447 --> 07:37.033
l left a dinner at the White House
to come here.

07:37.533 --> 07:38.826
l'm impressed.

07:38.993 --> 07:40.870
Really, l am.

07:41.037 --> 07:42.914
That still doesn't change the rules.

07:43.456 --> 07:45.792
l was hoping
l wouldn't have to resort to this.

07:47.126 --> 07:49.712
- Shooting your way in?
- Don't be silly.

07:49.879 --> 07:51.589
l don't have my weapon.

07:53.007 --> 07:56.219
- Calling the president?
- Now that would be overkill.

07:56.386 --> 07:57.929
<i>- Hello?
- Condi? Jenny.</i>

07:58.096 --> 07:59.889
<i>- Any word yet?
- No.</i>

08:00.056 --> 08:02.350
<i>- l don't have his condition yet.
- Well, why not?</i>

08:02.517 --> 08:04.977
The head nurse
won't let me into Trauma.

08:05.144 --> 08:07.146
<i>Let me speak with her.</i>

08:11.067 --> 08:14.153
<i>- Ethel Washington, ma'am.
- Condoleezza Rice, l have a request.</i>

08:14.320 --> 08:15.363
Yes, ma'am.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.241
l understand.

08:22.912 --> 08:25.915
<i>- Thank you, Condi.
- No problem.</i>

08:30.044 --> 08:31.629
McGee said that Gibbs
was in a bomb blast.

08:31.796 --> 08:34.506
He tried to sound really calm
but l could hear the fear in his voice.

08:34.674 --> 08:35.717
And he should be afraid.

08:35.883 --> 08:38.553
For Gibbs to be brought to a hospital
in the ambulance cannot be good.

08:38.720 --> 08:39.846
l had to come see for myself.

08:40.011 --> 08:43.850
My hearse got a flat, as usual,
so l got in a cab to go to the airport

08:44.015 --> 08:46.269
and then l realized
that by the time l got to the terminal

08:46.436 --> 08:48.396
and l bought a ticket
and l went through security

08:48.563 --> 08:50.356
and then l flew to Norfolk
and if l got a cab,

08:50.523 --> 08:52.650
it would be better
just to sit in the cab that l was in.

08:52.817 --> 08:55.486
So l did that. lt cost a lot of--
You know, it doesn't matter,

08:55.653 --> 08:58.281
this is Gibbs. l can't believe
that he's hurt. He is never hurt.

08:58.489 --> 08:59.991
Not hurt enough to go to a hospital.

09:00.158 --> 09:02.744
He has to be dying
to even go see a doctor.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.495
Oh, my God.

09:05.621 --> 09:09.250
He isn't dying, is he?
l don't know what l would do.

09:10.084 --> 09:12.670
Positive thoughts. Positive thoughts.
Positive thoughts.

09:12.837 --> 09:16.966
Okay, l know the rule is that you have
to be family to go into Emergency

09:17.133 --> 09:20.428
that's what they said when Uncle
Charlie got his leg caught in a trap.

09:20.595 --> 09:23.473
But Gibbs and me,
we're tighter than blood.

09:23.681 --> 09:25.975
l know you need lD.
l have an lD in here.

09:26.142 --> 09:28.019
l work at NClS.

09:28.186 --> 09:33.357
Forensics and ballistics,
chemical analysis, and DNA typing.

09:33.941 --> 09:36.694
Here. That's me. l promise. l just--

09:36.861 --> 09:40.698
l had to be in court that day.
But l swear, that is me.

09:51.292 --> 09:53.544
You're a really, really good person.

10:04.847 --> 10:08.101
You're gonna have to look
in there sooner or later, McGee.

10:08.684 --> 10:10.144
l already did.

10:12.438 --> 10:14.482
Ziva, l don't think
l can go in there.

10:14.816 --> 10:16.317
McGee.

10:17.068 --> 10:19.112
- l know.
- Don't let Tony smell fear

10:19.278 --> 10:20.697
- or else he'll just--
- Probie.

10:20.863 --> 10:22.824
l gotta special job for you.

10:23.366 --> 10:24.826
Too late.

10:25.827 --> 10:28.746
Bomb dog took point
on Rice Paddy Dike's foot locker.

10:28.913 --> 10:30.873
Tag and stow it in the truck
for Abby, would you?

10:31.457 --> 10:33.209
On it, boss.

10:34.877 --> 10:36.587
l do love it when he calls me boss.

10:36.796 --> 10:38.965
ls that why you're being nice to him?

10:39.215 --> 10:40.717
Nice?

10:40.883 --> 10:42.385
l'm not being nice.

10:43.344 --> 10:45.638
Lugging foot lockers is probie work.

10:47.724 --> 10:49.600
All right,
l cut the probie some slack.

10:50.601 --> 10:52.603
What a bad day.

10:52.770 --> 10:54.731
Yes.

10:54.897 --> 10:56.607
A very bad day.

10:57.108 --> 10:58.609
What's the point of origin?

10:58.776 --> 11:01.195
A 55-gallon oil drum.

11:01.362 --> 11:03.531
That twisted ring
is all that's left of it.

11:03.698 --> 11:06.367
What is an oil drum
doing in the laundry compartment?

11:07.118 --> 11:09.120
Well, ships clean them
and reuse them for storage.

11:09.287 --> 11:11.205
This one probably held dirty laundry.

11:11.372 --> 11:12.874
Very unsanitary.

11:13.041 --> 11:14.709
Fragments indicate a high explosive.

11:15.043 --> 11:17.503
Abby should be able to trace
the taggant.

11:17.670 --> 11:21.382
Why's the head and torso intact
when the rest of him is a slushie?

11:21.549 --> 11:25.178
Suicide bombers wearing
an explosive belt look like this.

11:25.720 --> 11:29.474
Except there's always something
left of their lower extremities.

11:29.849 --> 11:31.768
- You see a foot?
- Not even a tootsie.

11:32.268 --> 11:35.021
- A tootsie?
- A toe.

11:35.188 --> 11:36.606
Although in my generation

11:37.774 --> 11:41.652
''Tootsie'' also referred
to one's sweetie pie.

11:41.819 --> 11:43.780
Sweetie pie?

11:44.614 --> 11:48.242
- Any word from the hospital?
- Jethro's critical, but stable.

11:49.577 --> 11:53.373
Then he wasn't in here
when the bomb detonated, was he?

11:54.582 --> 11:56.292
That corner.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.797
How did he survive?

12:01.214 --> 12:04.258
The washer and dryer shielded him
from the main force of the blast.

12:11.808 --> 12:13.935
lt's raining.

12:25.154 --> 12:26.614
He's suffered a concussion

12:26.781 --> 12:28.908
but there are no signs
of intra-cerebral haemorrhaging.

12:29.075 --> 12:31.744
- He's going to be okay, though, right?
- He should be fine.

12:31.911 --> 12:33.830
l don't wanna hear should be,
l wanna hear will be.

12:33.996 --> 12:36.416
- Abby.
- Should be is not positive.

12:36.582 --> 12:38.292
Enough, Abs.

12:54.392 --> 12:55.852
l want to see what's under the hood.

12:56.018 --> 12:58.938
Hold the sedation
and call me when he wakes.

13:05.027 --> 13:09.240
l'm always positive, Ms. Sciuto.
But with a concussion, until--

13:09.741 --> 13:13.953
Until he wakes, no one knows
what's going on inside his brain.

13:29.677 --> 13:31.137
l'll miss you, Daddy.

13:31.304 --> 13:32.847
We've said it all before.

13:33.014 --> 13:34.223
l wanna hear it again.

13:34.390 --> 13:37.143
l will take care.
l will come back safe.

13:37.310 --> 13:38.561
Not those words.

13:38.728 --> 13:41.272
l love you.

13:57.731 --> 13:58.982
Shepard.

14:00.442 --> 14:02.068
Yikes. Agent DiNozzo here.

14:02.235 --> 14:04.904
Cynthia told me you stayed
at the hospital. ls the boss awake?

14:05.071 --> 14:07.741
l am, Agent DiNozzo.

14:09.659 --> 14:12.746
- You have a sit-rep for me?
- l do, Director Shepard.

14:12.912 --> 14:15.373
Crime scene's been processed.
Evidence tagged.

14:15.540 --> 14:16.916
Remains are on the way to autopsy.

14:17.083 --> 14:19.919
Officer David and Special Agent
McGee are questioning the crew.

14:20.086 --> 14:21.963
<i>We have an lD
on the suspected bomber.</i>

14:22.172 --> 14:24.591
<i>The freighter's radioman,
Pinpin Pula. Filipino.</i>

14:24.758 --> 14:26.843
Suspected to be Abu Sayyaf.

14:27.010 --> 14:28.928
BOLO's been issued
for his apprehension.

14:29.095 --> 14:31.514
That is all l have to report, ma'am.

14:32.390 --> 14:35.226
<i>- Agent DiNozzo.
- Director?</i>

14:36.186 --> 14:37.312
l was out of line.

14:37.479 --> 14:39.606
You are the director, ma'am.
You cannot be out of line.

14:39.773 --> 14:44.277
Please. l was bitchy.
Let me apologise.

14:45.862 --> 14:47.280
l'm sorry.

14:47.530 --> 14:49.115
<i>lf l may state an opinion, ma'am?</i>

14:50.116 --> 14:51.284
Fire away.

14:51.826 --> 14:53.286
Never apologise. lt's a--

14:53.495 --> 14:55.246
<i>- sign of weakness.
- Sign of weakness.</i>

14:56.206 --> 14:59.417
l was his partner too, DiNozzo.

15:00.001 --> 15:02.003
l know all the Gibbs-isms.

15:02.170 --> 15:03.963
Actually, he borrowed that one
from the Duke.

15:05.006 --> 15:06.299
John Wayne.

15:06.883 --> 15:09.594
<i>Said it to Joanne Dru in
She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.</i>

15:10.470 --> 15:12.555
Jethro's a lot like the Duke.

15:12.764 --> 15:14.015
<i>l keep waiting for him to say:</i>

15:14.391 --> 15:16.142
''That'll be the day.''

15:16.518 --> 15:21.147
He said that in Paris to me once
when l told him that l--

15:26.486 --> 15:28.279
When we were working together.

15:28.988 --> 15:30.490
Shouldn't he be awake by now?

15:30.657 --> 15:33.451
You know Gibbs.
He keeps his own schedule.

15:33.618 --> 15:35.161
Do you know what REM is?

15:35.328 --> 15:38.331
Sure. Rapid eye movement. Happens
when you're asleep and dreaming.

15:39.124 --> 15:41.334
That's what it looks like
he's doing right now.

15:41.501 --> 15:43.837
<i>Oh, well, that's gotta be
a good sign, right?</i>

15:44.003 --> 15:46.756
lf it isn't a nightmare.

15:55.056 --> 15:57.350
Gunny, they're both dead.

15:58.810 --> 16:01.146
l'm terribly sorry, Jethro.

16:01.354 --> 16:03.189
No.

16:08.820 --> 16:12.032
How many times are you going
to ask me the same question?

16:13.700 --> 16:15.368
No smoking.

16:19.622 --> 16:21.082
What'd he say?

16:30.383 --> 16:31.843
Wait, what'd you say?

16:32.052 --> 16:33.219
That l understood him.

16:33.386 --> 16:34.763
At least let my crew go ashore.

16:34.929 --> 16:37.682
They have been at sea
for two months.

16:38.558 --> 16:41.186
Excuse me. You don't appear
to be the kind of captain

16:41.394 --> 16:43.396
who actually cares about
the welfare of his crew.

16:43.563 --> 16:45.899
That's it. l want to speak
to Turkish consulate.

16:46.691 --> 16:48.401
- l can arrange that.
- Yes.

16:51.529 --> 16:54.240
- lf NClS agrees.
- We do not.

16:58.161 --> 17:00.330
Learn anything, Ziva?

17:00.497 --> 17:03.958
<i>Capitan Mahir knows
more than he's telling.</i>

17:04.541 --> 17:05.585
l know nothing.

17:10.256 --> 17:12.634
That's very Sergeant Schultz.

17:12.800 --> 17:13.926
Tony, how's the boss?

17:14.094 --> 17:15.929
l know nothing.

17:17.806 --> 17:18.932
That's not funny, Tony.

17:19.098 --> 17:21.643
McGee, it's the boss.
He'll be fine. With me.

17:25.939 --> 17:27.607
He'll be living off coffee next.

17:27.773 --> 17:29.859
Tony doesn't like coffee.

17:31.820 --> 17:33.363
Why do you suspect the captain?

17:33.571 --> 17:36.282
He smokes expensive Havanas
and wears a 1 0-carat diamond.

17:36.533 --> 17:37.659
Could be zircon.

17:37.867 --> 17:40.328
Never doubt an lsraeli
about diamonds.

17:40.495 --> 17:42.205
Our Turk captain likes money

17:42.414 --> 17:45.542
the kind Abu Sayyaf
pays to transport weapons,

17:45.750 --> 17:47.585
explosives and terrorists.

17:47.752 --> 17:49.963
l'll flip you to see
which of us takes the captain in

17:50.130 --> 17:51.965
and who visits Gibbs.

17:52.257 --> 17:53.758
l'll take him in.

17:53.925 --> 17:55.927
You don't speak Turkish.

17:59.639 --> 18:01.766
Your observations, Mr. Palmer.

18:01.933 --> 18:04.728
Well, fingerprints are out
of the question.

18:04.936 --> 18:08.857
l was rather hoping for something
other than the obvious.

18:09.524 --> 18:11.609
Well, we'll have to use DNA to--

18:13.737 --> 18:15.155
l guess that's rather obvious too.

18:17.741 --> 18:19.826
He was standing on the bomb.

18:19.993 --> 18:21.828
Better.

18:21.995 --> 18:24.289
- Why standing?
- Well, it seems to be the only way

18:24.456 --> 18:27.292
to explain his entire lower body
being vaporized.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.753
Why not sitting?

18:31.212 --> 18:33.965
Whatever he was sitting on
would have shielded his butt.

18:34.132 --> 18:38.511
Unless his buttocks
was sitting on the bomb.

18:38.678 --> 18:40.597
Who would sit on an explosive?

18:41.097 --> 18:44.851
Someone who didn't know
they were sitting on the explosive.

18:45.060 --> 18:47.312
- Of course.
- l did it myself once.

18:47.479 --> 18:49.522
No, twice.

18:49.731 --> 18:52.317
The first time l was young.
The second time, foolish.

18:52.484 --> 18:55.028
Why were you sitting
on an explosive, doctor?

18:55.195 --> 18:57.197
l just told you,
l was young and foolish.

18:57.364 --> 18:59.366
- Haven't you been listening?
- l was. l just--

18:59.991 --> 19:02.035
Specimen jar. Come on.

19:03.411 --> 19:09.793
lf l'm not mistaken, Abby will find
these to be fragments

19:09.959 --> 19:12.837
of the 55-gallon oil drum.

19:14.631 --> 19:17.258
l must ask Jethro--

19:20.804 --> 19:22.764
Should l take these to Abby now,
doctor?

19:25.392 --> 19:29.229
Soon as l've taken a tissue sample
for DNA confirmation.

19:29.396 --> 19:31.398
- ls that really necessary, sir?
- No.

19:31.606 --> 19:34.693
No, it is not necessary.
We could match his teeth.

19:35.360 --> 19:37.570
ls that what you'd prefer?

19:44.786 --> 19:47.706
A wise choice, Mr. Palmer.

19:55.547 --> 19:57.257
Coffee.

19:57.924 --> 20:00.552
- Coffee?
- Sure way to wake Gibbs.

20:01.094 --> 20:02.554
Good idea.

20:02.721 --> 20:05.932
But, he's intubated,
we'll have to use the lV.

20:11.396 --> 20:13.565
Tell Miss Sciuto that
l didn't abandon Gibbs.

20:13.732 --> 20:15.734
Chief neurologist would have
been here today, anyway.

20:16.443 --> 20:18.486
- l'm sure she'll understand.
- l hope so.

20:18.653 --> 20:20.113
l like women with fire.

20:21.406 --> 20:24.659
So the dog collar and the tats
had nothing to do with it?

20:28.455 --> 20:29.789
DiNozzo.

20:30.957 --> 20:33.418
Does he look in pain?

20:37.464 --> 20:39.132
l don't know.

20:39.299 --> 20:42.218
l've never seen Gibbs
show pain, director.

20:44.763 --> 20:47.432
Doctor, is he in pain?

20:48.850 --> 20:50.602
Doctor?

20:51.603 --> 20:52.812
Was this man a Marine?

20:53.980 --> 20:55.065
Yes.

20:55.440 --> 20:57.108
Wounded in Desert Storm?

20:58.318 --> 21:00.111
He has a Purple Heart.

21:00.653 --> 21:02.489
That's it.

21:02.989 --> 21:04.491
l treated him in Kuwait.

21:06.284 --> 21:09.746
Gibbs never told me
he was wounded in Desert Storm.

21:11.122 --> 21:13.208
Me neither, l saw his Purple Heart.

21:14.376 --> 21:16.378
He was in a coma
when we evac'd him to Frankfurt.

21:16.586 --> 21:18.004
l mean, you talk about déja vu.

21:19.005 --> 21:21.174
But is he in pain?

21:21.341 --> 21:22.425
Certainly not extreme pain.

21:22.592 --> 21:25.220
He may be hurting, but the only way
to know is for him to tell us.

21:26.513 --> 21:28.390
Why not give him painkillers
just in case?

21:28.598 --> 21:29.849
l want him to wake up.

21:30.225 --> 21:32.394
An opiate would only deepen
his coma.

21:33.395 --> 21:35.689
l've just never seen Jethro
look like this.

21:35.855 --> 21:37.357
l have.

21:37.524 --> 21:39.609
That's why l remembered him.

21:40.694 --> 21:42.862
That's the expression
he had in '91 .

21:43.029 --> 21:44.572
lt's more anguish than pain.

21:52.038 --> 21:54.791
- l want to gallop, Daddy.
- No, Kelly.

21:54.999 --> 21:57.043
Let her go, Shannon.

21:57.210 --> 21:58.878
Jethro.

22:12.059 --> 22:14.311
l've got a better chance
of hooking up with Jessica Alba

22:14.520 --> 22:16.396
than these guys do
of infiltrating Sealift.

22:16.563 --> 22:18.398
Every sailor has to go
through a series

22:18.607 --> 22:22.569
of stringent security checks
to be issued a special lD.

22:22.736 --> 22:24.696
<i>A hundred and ten civilian crews,
DiNozzo.</i>

22:25.030 --> 22:27.199
<i>Abu Sayyaf only needs
to slip a man in one.</i>

22:27.366 --> 22:28.992
lf Galib knew who that was

22:29.159 --> 22:31.870
or the name of the ship,
why'd he run?

22:32.037 --> 22:33.956
Why didn't he just let us
arrest him as planned?

22:34.122 --> 22:37.459
Give us the intel and then continue
undercover to Gitmo.

22:37.626 --> 22:39.753
<i>Either he didn't know,
but was close to finding out.</i>

22:39.920 --> 22:41.672
<i>Or he was on to something big</i>

22:41.838 --> 22:43.924
<i>that an NClS arrest
would jeopardise.</i>

22:44.091 --> 22:46.009
What's bigger
than blowing up one of our ships?

22:46.385 --> 22:49.096
<i>Blowing up a port.
Did you ever hear of Port Chicago?</i>

22:49.263 --> 22:50.305
No, but l saw the TV movie.

22:50.472 --> 22:53.308
Michael Jai White
is this guy who had--

22:53.517 --> 22:54.685
l see your point.

22:54.852 --> 22:56.603
<i>- Good.
- ls there any intel on the crew</i>

22:56.770 --> 22:58.814
especially this Pinpin Pula guy?

22:59.022 --> 23:00.524
We need his photo for a BOLO.

23:00.691 --> 23:03.485
<i>We took surveillance photos when
the crew was docked in lstanbul.</i>

23:03.652 --> 23:04.695
Great.

23:04.862 --> 23:09.324
<i>lf Galib had intel on Abu's plans,
did he have time to tell Gibbs?</i>

23:10.742 --> 23:14.204
Maybe. They were together
when the bomb went off.

23:15.998 --> 23:18.542
<i>Galib was a good agent.</i>

23:18.709 --> 23:22.379
<i>Let's hope Gibbs comes out
of this coma in time.</i>

23:23.505 --> 23:25.716
He will.

23:25.883 --> 23:28.802
l ordered another CAT scan
on the off chance

23:28.969 --> 23:31.430
that he haemorrhaged since
the last one. l think it's unlikely.

23:32.181 --> 23:35.726
- So why are you doing it?
- Covering my ass.

23:35.934 --> 23:38.979
You don't strike me
as the ass-covering type, doctor.

23:41.523 --> 23:44.902
You know, l dislike this
doctor-captain-director formality.

23:46.612 --> 23:48.322
l'm Todd.

23:48.655 --> 23:49.948
Jenny.

23:50.991 --> 23:53.535
The truth is, Jenny, l'm puzzled.

23:53.702 --> 23:56.997
Gibbs took a long time
to come out of the coma in '91 .

23:57.164 --> 24:00.000
You followed his case
after he left Kuwait?

24:00.167 --> 24:01.460
Not until today.

24:01.627 --> 24:03.921
From Frankfurt, he was air-vac'd
to Bethesda.

24:04.129 --> 24:06.423
They faxed me
his hospitalization records.

24:06.590 --> 24:09.343
He was in a coma for 1 9 days.

24:09.510 --> 24:12.971
- My God.
- That's not terribly unusual.

24:13.138 --> 24:15.140
But the tests weren't
typical of someone

24:15.307 --> 24:17.267
who was in a coma that deep.

24:17.434 --> 24:20.229
l mean, his CAT scan didn't
reveal any cerebral damage.

24:20.395 --> 24:22.856
His EEG was normal.

24:23.482 --> 24:25.192
lt's the same as now.

24:25.359 --> 24:27.861
How do you explain that?

24:28.195 --> 24:32.866
Sometimes patients
don't seem to want to wake up.

24:34.034 --> 24:38.205
Any reason why Gibbs
might be one of them?

24:58.851 --> 25:02.020
The NlS agent driving
was hit with a head shot.

25:03.772 --> 25:06.692
Your wife and daughter
died in the crash.

25:08.485 --> 25:10.988
- Mom's got one.
- Not as big as ours.

25:12.072 --> 25:13.323
lt's bigger, Daddy.

25:16.410 --> 25:18.036
Pedro Hernandez.

25:18.245 --> 25:21.415
The drug dealer
your wife saw kill a Marine.

25:25.127 --> 25:28.714
- Abby?
- l'm in here.

25:38.724 --> 25:42.311
- What are you doing?
- l'm worrying.

25:45.689 --> 25:47.524
Me too.

25:50.319 --> 25:53.071
You guys can just set that right
there on the floor. Thanks.

25:58.869 --> 26:00.412
What's the matter?

26:00.621 --> 26:02.331
Never heard a girl fart before?

26:04.166 --> 26:05.876
Guys, that was the hippo.

26:07.878 --> 26:08.962
Are you sure, McGee?

26:10.047 --> 26:11.882
Yeah, because you sound
more--

26:13.550 --> 26:17.179
- Feminine.
- Like a hippo cow?

26:25.729 --> 26:27.648
What aren't you telling me?

26:28.148 --> 26:29.233
What do you mean?

26:29.399 --> 26:31.693
You have that
''Three Little Pigs,'' look.

26:32.361 --> 26:34.655
- What?
- The three little pigs.

26:34.821 --> 26:36.114
They were afraid to open
the door

26:36.281 --> 26:38.909
because the big bad wolf
was outside.

26:40.160 --> 26:42.496
l have no idea
what you're talking about.

26:46.750 --> 26:47.918
This is going on my wall.

26:48.293 --> 26:51.296
l should be
a professional photographer.

26:53.382 --> 26:55.175
The director hasn't called.

26:55.342 --> 26:56.802
About?

26:56.969 --> 26:58.887
About...?

26:59.346 --> 27:00.848
Gibbs?

27:04.184 --> 27:05.686
She didn't call you, did she?

27:05.853 --> 27:08.188
- No.
- Because the way you're acting,

27:08.355 --> 27:10.315
you might have, just,
forgotten to tell us.

27:10.482 --> 27:13.527
Ziva, do you notice
anything different in here?

27:14.945 --> 27:18.198
- No music.
- That's it. No music.

27:18.615 --> 27:21.201
You know, you usually
play music in here.

27:21.410 --> 27:24.454
What if those were Gibbs' guts
smooshed all over that room?

27:24.621 --> 27:26.373
Oh, for God's sake, Abby.
They're not.

27:26.582 --> 27:28.083
l said what if they were?

27:28.876 --> 27:33.255
The colour would be more
coffee-brown than red.

27:42.848 --> 27:44.933
His skull was shattered

27:45.100 --> 27:47.728
when the explosion
blew him against the overhead

27:47.895 --> 27:49.396
as if he were fired from a cannon.

27:49.813 --> 27:51.773
- The oil drum.
- Precisely.

27:51.940 --> 27:55.110
Now don't ask me what our guest
was doing in an oil drum,

27:55.277 --> 27:58.363
sitting on a bomb
because l haven't the foggiest.

27:59.448 --> 28:00.824
No other explanation?

28:00.991 --> 28:04.828
Well, none that would explain
these remains.

28:08.373 --> 28:11.084
l need a positive lD
on this body, Duck.

28:11.335 --> 28:14.379
Well, DNA tissue
is in Abby's capable hands.

28:15.297 --> 28:16.965
How's Jethro?

28:18.550 --> 28:20.719
Still out. The director's with him.

28:20.886 --> 28:22.846
Yeah, l'd best get down to Portsmouth.

28:23.013 --> 28:24.473
Not until you finish the autopsy.

28:24.765 --> 28:26.517
And while you're at it,

28:26.934 --> 28:29.102
why don't you ask your guest
what he was doing sitting

28:29.353 --> 28:31.063
on an oil drum on a bomb?

28:31.271 --> 28:33.982
You sound like Gibbs.

28:35.317 --> 28:38.612
What were you doing
in that oil drum?

28:48.747 --> 28:51.083
Oh, boy. Tony,
l'm sorry. l'm so sorry.

28:52.501 --> 28:54.628
Sorry. l'm sorry.

28:58.382 --> 28:59.633
l'm sorry, Tony.

29:09.768 --> 29:12.396
Hate the sight of blood, probie?

29:12.813 --> 29:14.731
Too bad.

29:15.816 --> 29:17.901
- Oh, boy.
- Handkerchief.

29:18.068 --> 29:19.403
l don't have one.

29:21.154 --> 29:25.158
Whatever you came to say
better be pretty damn important.

29:26.493 --> 29:28.620
Abby slapped Ziva
and Ziva slapped her back.

29:29.204 --> 29:30.831
Damn. l missed it?

29:30.998 --> 29:32.958
- Yeah.
- All right.

29:33.125 --> 29:35.627
Assemble the team, including Abby.

29:35.794 --> 29:37.754
Abby?

29:44.344 --> 29:45.679
Right.

29:58.734 --> 30:00.903
<i>Which hospital? Portsmouth?</i>

30:01.069 --> 30:03.697
<i>You didn't ask?</i>

30:04.281 --> 30:08.660
<i>Oh, Ziva. l'm not implying
that you don't care.</i>

30:10.370 --> 30:12.539
<i>The way you're acting,
you might have just,</i>

30:12.706 --> 30:15.542
<i>l don't know, forgotten to tell us.</i>

30:15.709 --> 30:20.088
<i>What if those were Gibbs' guts
smooshed all over that room?</i>

30:23.258 --> 30:24.676
<i>l don't have an answer.</i>

30:24.885 --> 30:28.722
His EEG is normal.
His new CAT scan is normal.

30:29.556 --> 30:31.099
How well do you know Gibbs?

30:31.266 --> 30:33.060
He was my mentor at NClS.

30:33.227 --> 30:34.853
He taught me most of what l know.

30:35.771 --> 30:38.315
Yet you're his boss.

30:38.815 --> 30:41.151
Jethro's a great field agent.

30:41.318 --> 30:43.111
He's a great team leader.

30:43.278 --> 30:47.074
And he deals more efficiently
with difficult politicians than l do.

30:47.241 --> 30:50.577
- Well, why isn't he the--
- He shoots them.

30:55.374 --> 30:57.876
So you didn't know him when he was
wounded in Desert Storm?

30:59.378 --> 31:00.504
No.

31:00.712 --> 31:02.381
He seems to be repeating
that trauma,

31:02.548 --> 31:04.424
a coma he doesn't
wanna to wake up from.

31:05.384 --> 31:07.719
ln the morning l'm gonna
try to find the neurologist

31:07.886 --> 31:09.137
who was on his case in '91 .

31:09.304 --> 31:11.598
Well, why wait until the morning?

31:16.019 --> 31:18.105
- Forgive me.
- Yeah.

31:18.272 --> 31:20.732
l'm just tired.

31:21.608 --> 31:23.151
l can arrange a cot
for you in this room.

31:23.318 --> 31:24.736
No.

31:25.320 --> 31:28.782
l have been away from my office
far too long.

32:01.315 --> 32:03.483
l'll find someone
who knew Jethro back then.

32:04.484 --> 32:07.487
- That'd be helpful.
- Here are all my numbers.

32:08.780 --> 32:09.948
And my cell.

32:10.824 --> 32:12.659
l'll call you with an update
at 0900,

32:12.826 --> 32:14.578
earlier, if he shows any signs
of waking up.

32:17.080 --> 32:19.041
lt was good to meet you, Jenny.

32:19.249 --> 32:21.210
Not under the circumstances,
of course.

32:24.421 --> 32:27.257
But good nevertheless.

32:51.198 --> 32:53.784
- Cover your eyes.
- l've seen you and Mommy kiss.

32:53.992 --> 32:56.495
- Oh, this is scary kissing.
- Like kissing a frog?

32:57.287 --> 32:58.539
Cover them up.

33:02.292 --> 33:05.671
Much as l'd like to, l can't tell you
where the bastard's hiding, Gunny.

33:05.963 --> 33:07.881
l didn't ask you to,
Special Agent Franks.

33:11.718 --> 33:12.761
l'm going to take a leak.

33:33.306 --> 33:35.183
Pay up, McGee.

33:41.815 --> 33:44.776
- Hey.
- You're gonna bet on me, l collect.

33:45.193 --> 33:48.697
Abby. Front and centre.
You too, Ziva.

33:49.531 --> 33:51.449
Let's go.

33:56.663 --> 33:58.873
- l know what happened.
- Look, she slapped me

33:59.040 --> 34:01.334
- and l was just slapping her--
- Hey.

34:01.501 --> 34:03.420
lf there's gonna be any
bitch-slapping on this team,

34:03.587 --> 34:05.505
l'll do it.

34:05.672 --> 34:08.174
Clear? Good.

34:08.382 --> 34:11.219
Now shake hands. Shake.

34:14.264 --> 34:16.975
There we go.
That wasn't so tough, was it?

34:17.183 --> 34:18.601
Now, how about a little hug?

34:18.768 --> 34:20.937
Big buddy hug. Come on.

34:21.103 --> 34:23.273
There we go. Come on.

34:23.440 --> 34:25.609
Now a deep tongue kiss.

34:26.943 --> 34:28.445
Now we feel better.

34:28.945 --> 34:31.322
All right, what do you got, McGee?

34:34.367 --> 34:38.496
<i>We've got Singapore's surveillance
photos on the Bakir Kamir crew.</i>

34:40.748 --> 34:42.708
Make me hard copies, McGee.

34:42.876 --> 34:46.045
Captain Mahir will identify
Pinpin Pula for the BOLO.

34:46.212 --> 34:48.465
What makes you think he won't lie?

34:49.799 --> 34:51.217
Abby.

34:52.260 --> 34:55.679
The taggant traces on the metal
fragments were Semtex

34:55.847 --> 34:58.350
from the Czech Republic.
Khaddafi, before we bombed him

34:58.516 --> 35:02.187
was handing out Semtex like taffy
to any terrorist with a sweet tooth.

35:02.354 --> 35:05.148
That eliminates my
washing machine malfunction theory.

35:05.315 --> 35:06.399
DNA results?

35:06.566 --> 35:09.236
- They should be in by now.
- Then what are you doing here?

35:10.362 --> 35:12.405
Somebody called a conference.

35:13.832 --> 35:16.293
You don't think
that's Galib in autopsy?

35:17.919 --> 35:19.629
- He wants to be sure.
- l've asked Tel Aviv

35:19.838 --> 35:22.049
if Captain Mahir
is a blimp on their radar.

35:22.215 --> 35:23.508
Blip.

35:25.802 --> 35:30.640
DNA confirms the body in autopsy
is NClS Agent Abog Galib.

35:32.476 --> 35:34.311
Okay. Any hits on the BOLO?

35:34.478 --> 35:36.229
Too many without photos.

35:36.438 --> 35:40.233
LEOs are calling in reports
on every Filipino sailor in the area.

35:40.400 --> 35:41.818
Did you run them down?

35:41.985 --> 35:46.490
There's 250,000 Filipino sailors. That's
more than any nationality in the world.

35:46.656 --> 35:48.700
The way the reports are coming in,
you'd think that--

35:48.867 --> 35:51.203
Hey! l don't wanna hear
how tough it is, McGee.

35:51.370 --> 35:52.662
l want you to run them down.

35:52.829 --> 35:55.123
Stop playing Gibbs.

35:56.166 --> 35:58.168
There. You're doing it right now.

35:58.335 --> 35:59.669
Ziva, will you help me out here?

35:59.836 --> 36:01.338
lt's true, Tony.

36:01.505 --> 36:05.217
You're even getting a little grey
around the temples.

36:08.011 --> 36:10.013
You're not Gibbs, Tony.

36:11.223 --> 36:13.016
You're right.

36:13.183 --> 36:15.185
Acting like Gibbs
doesn't make me the boss.

36:15.352 --> 36:18.605
Being senior agent does.

36:18.772 --> 36:22.901
So if drinking coffee, staring
or whacking the back of your head

36:23.110 --> 36:25.362
helps me lead this team,

36:26.863 --> 36:28.698
live with it.

36:36.123 --> 36:38.083
Good morning, Agent Gibbs.

36:38.250 --> 36:42.129
The rain stopped.
lt's gonna be a beautiful day.

36:42.879 --> 36:45.132
Oh, l'm sorry.
l didn't mean to startle you.

36:45.298 --> 36:47.092
l'm Dr. Mallard.

36:47.259 --> 36:50.053
l overheard you talking
and l thought he might be awake.

36:50.721 --> 36:52.514
l always talk to my patients.

36:52.723 --> 36:54.391
Me too.

36:54.558 --> 36:55.726
Are you a neurologist, doctor?

36:55.934 --> 36:57.352
Medical examiner.

36:59.396 --> 37:03.567
Mine never wake up,
but still l talk to them.

37:07.487 --> 37:08.697
Well, Jethro,

37:08.989 --> 37:13.243
l'd have been here sooner
only DiNozzo insisted

37:13.410 --> 37:16.079
l finish the autopsy on Agent Galib.

37:16.288 --> 37:17.622
lt's fascinating.

37:17.789 --> 37:21.585
l mean, the poor man was, literally,
blown out of a barrel.

37:21.752 --> 37:26.715
lt reminded me of when my mother
and l visited her brother Carkin

37:26.923 --> 37:29.176
in the little town of Clagolaky.

37:29.384 --> 37:31.344
Yes, Carkin worked
at the cooperage

37:31.511 --> 37:34.973
where they make all the casks
for the various distilleries.

37:37.768 --> 37:39.561
Are you Turkish?

37:41.772 --> 37:43.106
Perhaps

37:43.440 --> 37:46.610
your father or grandfather

37:47.235 --> 37:48.820
was Turkish?

37:49.446 --> 37:52.074
Before they come to America?

37:53.033 --> 37:56.119
Can you see Ziva as a belly dancer?

37:57.537 --> 37:58.747
He brought it up.

37:59.164 --> 38:01.124
Why? Because he asked
if she was Turkish?

38:01.291 --> 38:03.001
<i>From Russia with Love.</i>

38:03.168 --> 38:06.296
Bond is ordered to Turkey

38:06.463 --> 38:09.800
to steal the Lector machine
from this beautiful,

38:09.966 --> 38:12.552
l mean, is there any other kind
in a James Bond movie,

38:12.761 --> 38:15.514
defecting Russian double agent

38:15.680 --> 38:18.850
Tatia Romaniva,
played by Daniela Bianchi.

38:19.017 --> 38:21.853
Greek. You are Greek.

38:23.814 --> 38:25.982
Greek. That's why you hate me.

38:26.149 --> 38:27.317
l am not Greek.

38:27.484 --> 38:29.152
Greek Cypriot.

38:29.319 --> 38:32.739
lt would explain your understanding
Turkish and hating me.

38:33.532 --> 38:36.952
l doubt Cyprus has
a liaison officer in the U.S.

38:38.495 --> 38:40.205
But you are getting warm.

38:40.706 --> 38:41.790
Liaison?

38:42.457 --> 38:46.461
<i>From the French word ''lier, ''
which means ''to bind.''</i>

38:46.628 --> 38:49.172
ln this case, bind NClS and Mossad.

38:55.887 --> 38:58.223
l have your dossier.

39:02.686 --> 39:04.479
Another French word.

39:04.688 --> 39:07.023
Dean Keaton. That's it.

39:07.190 --> 39:08.817
Dean Keaton is the name
of the character

39:08.984 --> 39:10.861
<i>Gabriel Byrne plays
in The Usual Suspects.</i>

39:11.027 --> 39:12.529
l knew it'd come to me.

39:13.780 --> 39:16.158
l am not a terrorist.

39:16.324 --> 39:19.036
l did not smuggle weapons
into Palestine. l swear it.

39:19.244 --> 39:21.538
Or Hamas suicide bombers
into the port of Ashdod?

39:21.705 --> 39:23.623
Mossad blames me for that too?

39:23.790 --> 39:25.292
And much more.

39:25.459 --> 39:28.253
Now, look, l am not a terrorist.

39:28.462 --> 39:30.756
No Wahhabi. l fight no Jihad.

39:30.964 --> 39:33.050
You profit from it, you swine.

39:33.216 --> 39:35.052
And for that, you should die.

39:43.060 --> 39:45.771
<i>Fortunately for you, Capitan Mahir,</i>

39:46.271 --> 39:48.774
<i>politique pratique has suspended</i>

39:48.982 --> 39:53.028
lsraeli reprisals
against all but terrorists.

39:59.743 --> 40:01.828
And you say you are no terrorist.

40:01.995 --> 40:03.789
l swear by God.

40:04.998 --> 40:06.958
Convince me.

40:15.258 --> 40:17.302
Pinpin Pula.

40:23.392 --> 40:26.269
Lisa Guiraut plays one
of those belly dancing women.

40:26.436 --> 40:28.730
Very hot. She'd be a grandmother
by now.

40:28.939 --> 40:33.110
Oh, wait a second. Okay.
Ziva looks like her, which is--?

40:33.318 --> 40:36.947
Pay attention, probie. Ziva's
about to get a photo for the BOLO.

40:45.080 --> 40:47.541
Winning the Scotsman
Chess Trophy

40:47.708 --> 40:51.294
was the highlight
of my lower-sixth year.

40:51.461 --> 40:53.213
l didn't compete in Edinburgh.

40:53.380 --> 40:57.342
No, no. l was too distracted
by this wee--

40:59.177 --> 41:01.096
lt was impolite of me to eavesdrop,
Dr. Mallard,

41:01.263 --> 41:03.181
but l was fascinated by your story.

41:04.683 --> 41:07.227
Nurse Baliad told me your name
and your speciality. l'm Dr.--

41:07.394 --> 41:11.732
Dr. Gelfand, Chief Neurologist.
Yes, the director told me.

41:13.066 --> 41:14.651
Well, how is our patient?

41:14.818 --> 41:17.154
Still comatose, l'm afraid.

41:17.946 --> 41:20.782
Were you aware
that he was in a coma for 1 9 days

41:20.949 --> 41:22.826
during Desert Storm?

41:22.993 --> 41:24.453
No.

41:25.328 --> 41:26.538
He never told you?

41:26.705 --> 41:29.499
Well, Jethro doesn't talk much
about the past.

41:29.666 --> 41:32.335
l consider us to be close friends

41:32.502 --> 41:36.173
but l know very little
about his life before we met.

42:19.674 --> 42:21.510
You're in a hospital. Relax.

42:22.552 --> 42:24.888
- Don't fight it, Jethro.
- Relax, relax. You're all right.

42:25.055 --> 42:26.181
Here, come on. Come on.

42:26.515 --> 42:28.350
Can you blink?

42:28.517 --> 42:31.228
All right. Raise your thumb.
Raise your thumb. Good. Good.

42:31.395 --> 42:32.437
Do you want the tube out?

42:34.689 --> 42:38.193
All right, all right. Hold still. Hold still.

42:41.988 --> 42:43.990
- Here you are.
- Okay, breathe. You're fine.

42:44.157 --> 42:46.284
- That's it.
- l am Dr. Gelfand.

42:46.451 --> 42:48.578
- This is Nurse Baliad.
- Maria.

42:48.745 --> 42:51.164
- Of course you know Dr. Mallard.
- He calls me Ducky.

42:51.331 --> 42:52.457
Welcome back, Jethro.

42:53.333 --> 42:55.544
Yeah, we've all been
a bit concerned.

42:55.711 --> 42:58.588
You shouldn't frighten us like this.

42:59.923 --> 43:01.591
You have a question?

43:04.803 --> 43:06.054
Where am l?

43:06.221 --> 43:08.223
You're in Portsmouth
Naval Trauma Centre.

43:08.974 --> 43:10.976
You were in an explosion.

43:11.143 --> 43:13.437
Relax. Cover your face.

43:14.479 --> 43:16.148
l remember.

43:16.314 --> 43:19.943
Good. Very good. Most people
never remember the trauma.

43:25.532 --> 43:27.576
l don't know him.
