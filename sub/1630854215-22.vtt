WEBVTT

00:00.669 --> 00:02.437
You should put this on now.

00:02.570 --> 00:04.740
My contractions are still
nine minutes apart,

00:04.874 --> 00:07.008
and they're not...

00:07.141 --> 00:08.844
not that bad.

00:08.978 --> 00:12.080
They are now 8 minutes
and 45 seconds apart.

00:12.213 --> 00:14.950
We should get pancakes.
Where's my sweater?

00:15.083 --> 00:17.620
I don't want pancakes.
I want you to put this on.

00:17.753 --> 00:21.256
Shoot... I forgot my lucky socks.

00:21.389 --> 00:23.067
The ones I wore last time
I was in the hospital...

00:23.091 --> 00:24.660
when my brilliant husband
came up

00:24.793 --> 00:26.353
with a miracle surgery
to save our baby.

00:26.461 --> 00:27.730
Those are hospital socks.

00:27.863 --> 00:30.164
They are identical to
all the other hospital socks.

00:30.298 --> 00:31.600
I will get you another pair.

00:31.734 --> 00:33.869
But they won't be my lucky ones.

00:34.003 --> 00:35.671
- I'll go home and get them.
- N-No.

00:35.804 --> 00:37.907
You need to stay here.
And put this on.

00:38.039 --> 00:40.041
And get hooked up
to a fetal monitor.

00:40.174 --> 00:41.476
I will get the socks.

00:43.979 --> 00:45.480
Okay.

00:53.022 --> 00:55.490
How long after we get there
will the surgery start?

00:56.559 --> 00:57.669
You'll go straight
to the pre-op,

00:57.693 --> 00:59.895
where they'll do
a chest X-ray and echo.

01:00.029 --> 01:02.031
Why waste time with that?
I need a new valve.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.498
There's no mystery here.

01:03.632 --> 01:05.300
We'll also need blood
and urine samples.

01:05.433 --> 01:07.201
I can give you that right now.

01:07.335 --> 01:09.038
That's...
not necessary.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.006
Efficiency, boys.

01:11.139 --> 01:13.408
Clearly, none of you
have been in the military.

01:18.013 --> 01:19.724
Yeah. We're Oscar-Mike
from the nursing home,

01:19.748 --> 01:21.550
but some dense fog
put us behind schedule.

01:21.684 --> 01:23.251
Yeah. Make sure
the O.R. is prepped

01:23.384 --> 01:25.329
and Dr. Park is at the ready
for Mr. Ermey when we get there.

01:25.353 --> 01:26.354
On the double.

01:26.989 --> 01:27.823
Your dad a Marine?

01:27.957 --> 01:29.090
Brother.

01:29.223 --> 01:31.860
Oorah.

01:31.994 --> 01:35.064
Okay. Just make sure
your "dense fog" excuse

01:35.196 --> 01:37.098
is only for your
critical care transport

01:37.231 --> 01:38.067
<i>and not dinner tonight.</i>

01:38.199 --> 01:39.935
Um, dress code?

01:40.069 --> 01:41.402
To the nines.

01:41.537 --> 01:42.538
Going tens.

01:52.915 --> 01:53.916
Hello?

01:54.049 --> 01:55.050
Danny?

01:56.384 --> 01:57.820
You there?

01:57.953 --> 01:59.187
Danny?

02:09.396 --> 02:10.765
You okay?

02:10.899 --> 02:14.469
My knee's kind of messed up,
but otherwise okay.

02:16.337 --> 02:18.574
Mr. Ermey?
We've been in a crash.

02:18.707 --> 02:19.784
All right.
We're gonna get you down.

02:19.808 --> 02:20.843
- Okay.
- All right.

02:20.976 --> 02:22.477
- You got his legs?
- Yeah.

02:22.611 --> 02:23.712
All right.
Three, two, one.

02:23.846 --> 02:25.781
Gotcha.

02:25.914 --> 02:27.314
- All right.
- Take his armband off.

02:27.415 --> 02:29.615
- Yeah, I'm all right. I'm all right.
- Watch your head.

02:31.086 --> 02:33.388
Okay.
I'm gonna unstrap you.

02:33.522 --> 02:34.355
- Okay.
- All right. You ready?

02:34.489 --> 02:35.958
Three-two, one.

02:36.091 --> 02:38.159
- I'm good.
I'm good.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.293
- You good?
- Yeah, yeah.

02:41.864 --> 02:43.431
Okay.

02:57.412 --> 02:59.414
The truck came over the line.
I had nowhere to go.

02:59.548 --> 03:00.683
Are you all right?

03:00.816 --> 03:02.017
I think my leg's broken.

03:02.151 --> 03:03.591
Okay. Stay up there.
I'll get to you.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.453
Can you reach your radio?

03:05.587 --> 03:06.798
We're gonna need at least
five more ambulances.

03:06.822 --> 03:08.023
Got it.

03:08.157 --> 03:09.199
Danny, you take the driver
of the pick-up truck.

03:09.223 --> 03:10.602
- I'll get to the family.
- All right.

03:10.626 --> 03:11.626
Dispatch...

03:18.332 --> 03:19.501
It's gonna be okay, girls.

03:19.635 --> 03:20.712
Okay, I'm Jared.
I'm a doctor.

03:20.736 --> 03:22.171
- What's your name?
- Kenny.

03:22.303 --> 03:23.572
I can't breathe.

03:23.706 --> 03:25.282
Kenny, any pain in your chest?
Trouble breathing?

03:25.306 --> 03:26.675
I'm okay.
I'm okay. Help them.

03:26.809 --> 03:28.689
All right. You sit over there.
I'll get to them.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.747
Hey, girls.

03:31.880 --> 03:32.957
I'm gonna get you out
of these car seats

03:32.981 --> 03:33.816
so you can be
with your dad, okay?

03:33.949 --> 03:36.250
- What's your name?
- I'm Bea.

03:36.384 --> 03:38.654
- Okay, Bea.
- My sister's name is Ella.

03:38.787 --> 03:40.388
Okay. Okay.
All right.

03:40.522 --> 03:41.990
Let's get you out of there.

03:42.124 --> 03:43.726
It's gonna be okay.

03:43.859 --> 03:45.794
Good job, Bea.
Well done.

03:45.928 --> 03:47.448
Ella, I'll be right back
for you, okay?

03:47.563 --> 03:49.397
Good job.
Now, you go to your dad.

03:49.531 --> 03:51.066
- There you go.
- I got you. I got you.

03:54.903 --> 03:57.305
He's alive!
He's alive!

03:57.438 --> 03:58.638
But pulse is weak and thready.

03:58.707 --> 04:00.642
Hey.

04:00.776 --> 04:02.087
I'm gonna get you
out of here safe, all right?

04:02.111 --> 04:03.746
Yeah, yeah. Don't worry.
I'm fine.

04:03.879 --> 04:05.681
All right.
Hold still, please.

04:05.814 --> 04:08.416
Okay, Ella. I'm Dr. Kalu.
Are you okay?

04:08.550 --> 04:11.553
My chest... I can't breathe.

04:14.022 --> 04:16.534
Okay. Let's get you out of here so
you can be with your dad, all right?

04:16.558 --> 04:17.892
Good job, Ella.

04:18.026 --> 04:20.728
I've got you. That's it.
You're doing so well.

04:20.863 --> 04:23.065
I've got you.
Get you under here.

04:23.198 --> 04:24.700
Come on.

04:24.833 --> 04:26.702
Okay. Good job, guys.

04:26.835 --> 04:28.704
Good job.

04:30.939 --> 04:32.708
No, no, no, no, no.

04:32.841 --> 04:34.877
No. Hey! Hey!

04:35.010 --> 04:37.012
Stop! Stop! Hey!

04:38.113 --> 04:39.347
Danny!

05:02.771 --> 05:04.506
Lea's in labor.

05:04.640 --> 05:06.407
We're having our baby today.

05:09.191 --> 05:10.327
Congratulations.

05:26.762 --> 05:28.130
Morning, ladies.

05:28.263 --> 05:30.899
Eden, clocking in today?

05:31.033 --> 05:33.602
My trial had three participants
drop out at the last minute,

05:33.735 --> 05:35.838
and every available nanny
within 90 miles

05:35.971 --> 05:38.307
is either dumb, lazy,
or incompetent.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.474
Mommy Morgan has
very exacting standards.

05:40.609 --> 05:43.312
I'm willing to lower them
momentarily if you're available.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.084
I just need a few minutes
to give my spiel

05:45.113 --> 05:47.282
to a room full of
perimenopausal IBS patients.

05:47.415 --> 05:49.051
I would, but I just got paged
to the E.R.

05:55.489 --> 05:56.792
I'll stop by later.

06:03.799 --> 06:05.033
Be professional.

06:06.635 --> 06:08.136
At least five seriously injured

06:08.270 --> 06:10.438
multi-vehicle collision
patients are inbound,

06:10.572 --> 06:11.807
including Dr. Perez.

06:11.940 --> 06:13.208
I'll take the first patient.

06:13.342 --> 06:15.544
Then Dr. Park,
then Andrews, Wolke, and Allen,

06:15.677 --> 06:17.012
in that order.

06:17.145 --> 06:19.157
Senior doctors, when you have
stabilized your patients,

06:19.181 --> 06:21.149
- please circle back
and assist the residents.

06:21.283 --> 06:23.051
Take a deep breath, everybody.

06:23.185 --> 06:25.296
Driver of the last car of the
pile-up... head-on collision.

06:25.320 --> 06:27.189
Conscious, has a pulse,
but not responding.

06:27.322 --> 06:30.225
Suspected cervical spinal cord
and brachial plexus injury.

06:30.359 --> 06:31.425
Chest hurts.

06:31.560 --> 06:33.662
Where's my phone?
I need to make a call.

06:33.795 --> 06:35.475
You'll get your phone call
soon, Mr. Ermey.

06:36.497 --> 06:37.900
Get an eFAST
and assess for shock.

06:38.033 --> 06:39.601
Let's fix that lac.

06:39.735 --> 06:40.845
I need to drain
the hemopericardium.

06:40.869 --> 06:42.571
Give FFP to control
the bleeding.

06:42.704 --> 06:45.207
Fracture of the right femoral
shaft and left distal radius.

06:45.340 --> 06:46.608
We got it.

06:46.742 --> 06:48.377
- Hey, are you okay?
- I'm... I'm good.

06:48.510 --> 06:49.878
Where's Perez?

06:50.012 --> 06:51.222
Kalu is bringing him
in the last ambulance.

06:51.246 --> 06:53.181
So, he's the least critical?

06:53.315 --> 06:54.583
He's...

06:54.716 --> 06:55.884
He'll be here soon.

06:58.020 --> 07:00.756
Multiple rib fractures
and associated pneumothorax.

07:00.889 --> 07:02.858
It hurts.

07:04.526 --> 07:06.595
Hey, I'm Dr. Wolke.

07:06.728 --> 07:07.863
We're gonna help you, okay?

07:14.102 --> 07:15.102
Finally.

07:26.114 --> 07:27.754
Still no purposeful eye
or limb movements.

07:27.849 --> 07:29.060
Likely a high c-spine fracture.

07:29.084 --> 07:30.924
Let's get her stabilized
for a trauma pan-scan.

07:32.621 --> 07:33.998
Massive right-side
hemopneumothorax,

07:34.022 --> 07:35.424
but she's holding her own
on vitals.

07:35.557 --> 07:37.101
- She needs a chest tube.
- What does that mean?

07:37.125 --> 07:38.703
- Is... Is she gonna...
- She's gonna be okay.

07:38.727 --> 07:40.772
We just need to make sure that
you and the little one are good.

07:40.796 --> 07:42.807
- If you could take a seat... -
I-I-I'm fine. Just a bruise from my...

07:42.831 --> 07:44.175
Yes, I know you feel fine,
but we need to make sure.

07:44.199 --> 07:45.667
I-It's okay, Bea.

07:45.801 --> 07:47.069
Um, I-I-I got to call my wife.

07:47.202 --> 07:49.671
She doesn't even know
any of this happened.

07:49.805 --> 07:51.073
Abdominal ecchymosis,

07:51.206 --> 07:53.275
peritoneal hemorrhage,
possible hemothorax.

07:53.408 --> 07:54.609
You're bleeding everywhere.

07:54.743 --> 07:56.383
Call up to O.R. 2
for an emergency ex lap.

07:57.913 --> 07:58.914
No opioids.

07:59.047 --> 08:00.047
What?

08:00.515 --> 08:02.317
Just promise me.

08:02.451 --> 08:03.451
No opioids.

08:04.485 --> 08:05.921
Okay.

08:07.689 --> 08:09.169
Tell the anesthesiologist
opioid-free.

08:12.327 --> 08:14.529
Considerable
intraperitoneal fluid.

08:14.663 --> 08:17.008
She has a perforation and needs
abdominal surgery right away.

08:17.032 --> 08:18.600
No! Dad!

08:18.734 --> 08:20.469
It's gonna be okay, baby.

08:20.602 --> 08:22.682
Mommy will be here soon,
and we'll all play <i>Scrabble.</i>

08:26.041 --> 08:27.441
We think you suffered
a neck injury,

08:27.476 --> 08:29.636
but we need to get some images
so we can tell for sure.

08:36.585 --> 08:38.153
Hey.

08:38.285 --> 08:40.446
All stabilizing ligaments
have been completely severed.

08:43.759 --> 08:46.161
Internal decapitation.

08:46.294 --> 08:47.734
Have you ever worked
on one of these?

08:48.764 --> 08:50.332
Never even seen one.

08:56.819 --> 08:58.487
Why aren't you
in your patient room?

08:58.707 --> 09:00.636
I had some last-minute
e-mails to send,

09:00.677 --> 09:02.879
and my preggo-brain
forgot my laptop in here.

09:03.013 --> 09:04.214
Did you get my socks?

09:04.348 --> 09:06.116
Is there something wrong
with your room?

09:06.250 --> 09:08.418
We could get you extra blankets.

09:11.855 --> 09:12.923
What is this?

09:13.056 --> 09:15.692
This is the cutest hat
I've ever seen.

09:18.228 --> 09:20.697
I got one for each of us.

09:20.831 --> 09:23.467
Shaun, I love them.

09:28.038 --> 09:29.906
We should take it to Glassy.

09:31.041 --> 09:33.510
We should go to your room.

09:33.644 --> 09:36.313
I-I know things are...

09:36.446 --> 09:38.215
difficult between you two
right now,

09:38.348 --> 09:41.218
but his grandson
is being born today.

09:42.552 --> 09:43.787
He knows.

09:45.555 --> 09:47.958
He said, "Congratulations,"

09:48.091 --> 09:49.131
and then he shut the door.

09:53.324 --> 09:56.505
We need to get you hooked up
to a fetal monitor.

10:03.257 --> 10:06.842
The surgery went well, we
repaired Ella's bowel perforation.

10:07.878 --> 10:10.701
Mommy, did you bring snacks?

10:11.381 --> 10:12.883
We'll go to the cafeteria
together

10:13.016 --> 10:14.776
as soon as we're done
talking to the doctors.

10:15.587 --> 10:16.587
When can she go home?

10:17.788 --> 10:20.390
There was some damage
to her spleen.

10:20.525 --> 10:22.560
We'll need to monitor that
for the next few days,

10:22.693 --> 10:23.933
make sure it doesn't get worse.

10:23.961 --> 10:25.001
But I'll keep you updated.

10:27.731 --> 10:29.776
I've got to be in the O.R.
in 10 minutes for my valve replacement.

10:29.800 --> 10:32.469
Order a post-op CT
and run serial hematocrits.

10:38.543 --> 10:40.477
Sorry.

10:40.612 --> 10:43.046
I'm not used to having
consultations in my kitchen.

10:43.180 --> 10:46.016
I've never seen that much
separation between skull and spine.

10:46.150 --> 10:47.651
Have you?
Not in anyone alive.

10:49.554 --> 10:51.989
I was thinking occipitocervical
fusion surgery

10:52.122 --> 10:54.424
using a plate
with four-point fixation

10:54.559 --> 10:56.239
and transpedicular
and translaminar screws.

10:57.961 --> 11:00.164
You're gonna have to add

11:00.297 --> 11:03.700
iliac crest graft
and Songer cables.

11:06.538 --> 11:09.106
You're looking at over
two hours just to realign

11:09.239 --> 11:11.175
and stabilize
the skull and the spine,

11:11.308 --> 11:12.508
and then the real work begins.

11:13.977 --> 11:15.513
Your odds of success
are somewhere

11:15.647 --> 11:19.783
between minimal and nonexistent.

11:19.917 --> 11:22.819
Well, marathons are pointless,
but millions of people run them anyway.

11:24.421 --> 11:25.689
Feel like running?

11:25.822 --> 11:27.858
I've been deemed "unfit."

11:27.991 --> 11:29.751
You wouldn't be cutting.
You'd be consulting.

11:30.761 --> 11:32.530
Flattering.

11:32.664 --> 11:35.299
You're still one of the world's
foremost experts

11:35.432 --> 11:37.267
on the brain and spine,

11:37.401 --> 11:39.281
and my patient's head
is hanging on by a thread.

11:41.805 --> 11:44.341
This one's scary.
I could use some help.

11:48.445 --> 11:49.479
Sure.

11:49.614 --> 11:52.316
I'm up for some...
color commentary.

11:56.820 --> 11:59.356
You have another contraction
coming in one to two seconds,

11:59.489 --> 12:00.489
and it is a big...

12:02.426 --> 12:03.794
one.

12:03.927 --> 12:06.730
They are now six minutes apart
and increasing in intensity.

12:06.863 --> 12:09.333
We should have the nurse
check your dilation again.

12:12.069 --> 12:15.072
Hi. Big day.
Excited for you both.

12:15.205 --> 12:17.508
Everyone is busy
because of the accident...

12:17.642 --> 12:19.385
Lim is prepping, Andrews
and Park are in surgery...

12:19.409 --> 12:21.546
And I think my patient
is in trouble.

12:21.679 --> 12:23.790
Her latest CT shows her splenic
injury is getting worse.

12:23.814 --> 12:25.249
How's Perez doing?

12:25.382 --> 12:27.022
They're just finishing up
his surgery now.

12:27.050 --> 12:29.654
Your patient needs
a splenic artery embolization.

12:29.786 --> 12:31.599
How long can she wait?
There are no attendings available.

12:31.623 --> 12:32.623
She cannot wait.

12:33.790 --> 12:34.958
Shaun...

12:35.092 --> 12:37.595
you need to do the surgery.

12:37.729 --> 12:41.765
I... should be here with you,
to give you ice chips

12:41.898 --> 12:44.569
and hold your hand
and talk about the future.

12:44.702 --> 12:47.004
Have you been watching movies
about people having babies?

12:48.905 --> 12:50.207
I'm fine.

12:50.340 --> 12:52.420
I have hours to go before
the Peanut makes his debut,

12:52.543 --> 12:54.845
and how complicated
is this procedure?

12:54.978 --> 12:56.213
It is quite straightforward.

12:57.453 --> 13:00.727
I love you, and I'm so happy
we're starting our family.

13:00.752 --> 13:03.453
But there's a little girl
who needs you.

13:06.256 --> 13:07.791
Please, go.

13:08.855 --> 13:11.504
Okay.
Prep the O.R.

13:16.466 --> 13:18.235
Do not have this baby
without me!

13:33.115 --> 13:34.216
No opioids.

13:36.517 --> 13:37.517
Thank you.

13:38.525 --> 13:40.059
You want the itemized list?

13:42.119 --> 13:43.954
Multiple
displaced rib fractures,

13:44.150 --> 13:46.652
contusions on both lungs,
abdominal bleeding,

13:46.677 --> 13:50.481
and a fractured pancreas,
which is as painful as it gets.

13:54.041 --> 13:56.977
Danny, you need to let me
give you pain meds,

13:57.111 --> 13:58.678
- real pain meds.
- No.

13:58.811 --> 14:01.247
I've already got you on
acetaminophen, lidocaine,

14:01.380 --> 14:03.416
gabapentin, and magnesium.

14:03.549 --> 14:05.718
Your heart rate and BP
are still elevated.

14:05.852 --> 14:07.529
You are at risk
for a heart attack or stroke.

14:07.553 --> 14:08.688
No.

14:10.556 --> 14:12.092
I worked way too hard
getting sober.

14:14.761 --> 14:16.230
I can't go back to square one.

14:16.362 --> 14:18.698
You need opioids.

14:20.533 --> 14:21.534
What I need...

14:23.569 --> 14:26.106
is to hear you tell me
about our dinner tonight.

14:28.008 --> 14:29.408
Please.

14:29.542 --> 14:31.111
Distract me.

14:37.117 --> 14:40.787
The restaurant is
very romantic...

14:40.921 --> 14:44.390
Tablecloths and candles
everywhere.

14:44.524 --> 14:47.727
And the music isn't so loud that
it drowns out all conversation.

14:56.769 --> 14:57.804
The trial starts Monday.

14:57.938 --> 14:59.539
You'd only be in-patient
for three days,

14:59.672 --> 15:01.808
then weekly check-ins
for six weeks.

15:01.942 --> 15:04.111
I suppose I could hire
a dog-sitter.

15:04.244 --> 15:06.646
- But Lincoln doesn't
like new people.

15:06.779 --> 15:09.515
Or tall people.
Or men.

15:09.649 --> 15:11.884
Can you excuse me
for just one second?

15:12.019 --> 15:14.320
She's the sweetest girl.

15:14.453 --> 15:16.756
She prefers to face out,
be involved.

15:17.557 --> 15:18.858
Yeah. Better.

15:18.992 --> 15:20.961
I'm almost done here.

15:21.094 --> 15:23.605
I need to push my 2:00 p.m.
to 3:00 p.m., my 3:00 p.m. to tomorrow.

15:23.629 --> 15:25.933
So, is it three days
and two nights?

15:26.066 --> 15:27.667
- Or three days
and three nights?

15:27.800 --> 15:29.120
Sorry.
A little more head support.

15:30.436 --> 15:31.437
No, not like that.

15:33.673 --> 15:34.908
Just...

15:35.042 --> 15:36.409
Here we go.
Right there.

15:36.542 --> 15:39.179
I need to go.
Lincoln's waiting.

15:39.313 --> 15:42.149
No. Wait. Barbara, it's...
It's two nights.

15:51.624 --> 15:53.293
Please go talk to him.

15:53.426 --> 15:56.296
Shouldn't you be in a room
somewhere, having a baby?

15:56.429 --> 15:58.131
Congratulations, by the way.

15:58.265 --> 16:00.466
You two cannot be
in a fight today.

16:00.600 --> 16:02.069
It's not a fight.

16:02.202 --> 16:04.503
I know it's a big deal,
but can you please put it aside,

16:04.637 --> 16:06.106
at least for today?

16:06.240 --> 16:08.275
I got to go to the O.R.

16:08.407 --> 16:10.978
This is probably the most
important day of Shaun's life.

16:11.111 --> 16:12.312
He needs his father.

16:16.649 --> 16:17.717
My God.

16:17.850 --> 16:18.930
Either my water just broke,

16:18.986 --> 16:20.853
or I just peed
all over your office.

16:20.988 --> 16:22.521
Either way, it would be a first.

16:22.655 --> 16:24.958
- You have plenty of time.
Here, let me help you.

16:25.092 --> 16:26.893
No, no.
I'm married to Dr. Shaun Murphy.

16:27.027 --> 16:28.427
He has walked me
through the steps

16:28.561 --> 16:30.330
of the birthing process
many, many times.

16:30.463 --> 16:31.999
I can take it from here.

16:34.368 --> 16:35.903
Please go talk to him.

16:36.036 --> 16:37.070
I'll call janitorial.

16:37.204 --> 16:38.738
I just...

16:42.475 --> 16:45.979
Gail, always a nice surprise,
but you caught me on a busy day.

16:46.113 --> 16:48.481
Well, sadly,
I'm about to make it busier.

16:48.614 --> 16:50.694
The board's calling an
emergency meeting for tonight.

16:50.816 --> 16:53.552
Okay, and what is the board
defining as an emergency today?

16:54.420 --> 16:56.390
You, Marcus.

16:56.522 --> 16:58.667
And how you're going to handle
the nurses' push to unionize.

16:58.691 --> 17:00.260
I'm on top of it.

17:00.394 --> 17:01.861
That's the problem.

17:06.898 --> 17:09.368
The splenic artery embolization
went very well.

17:09.502 --> 17:12.138
Your daughter should not need
any more surgeries.

17:12.271 --> 17:14.007
She'll need to spend
the next few days

17:14.141 --> 17:16.410
in the hospital until we
can remove her NG tube,

17:16.541 --> 17:18.444
get her back on regular...

17:18.577 --> 17:20.780
Honey? Wha...

17:22.115 --> 17:24.884
- What's happening?
- Profoundly hypotensive.

17:25.018 --> 17:28.055
- Kenny!
Pulse disparity -between arms.

17:28.188 --> 17:29.755
This is likely
an aortic dissection.

17:29.889 --> 17:31.757
We need to get him
to an O.R., stat.

17:35.062 --> 17:37.830
Reasonably happy in this life...

17:37.965 --> 17:40.633
Supremely happy with You
forever in the next.

17:40.766 --> 17:42.169
Amen.

17:43.536 --> 17:46.639
Danny, your BP's 211 over 130,
heart rate 194.

17:46.772 --> 17:48.208
You're having
a hypertensive crisis.

17:48.342 --> 17:50.110
You need fentanyl.
The pain is killing you.

17:50.243 --> 17:53.280
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things

17:53.413 --> 17:54.780
I cannot change...

17:58.452 --> 18:00.586
He asked you not to do that.

18:00.720 --> 18:02.597
He's not responding
to the antihypertensive drips.

18:02.621 --> 18:03.889
Right, so up the dose.

18:04.024 --> 18:05.701
He's tachycardic and
hypertensive because of the pain.

18:05.725 --> 18:06.927
He's going into shock.

18:07.060 --> 18:09.096
- He's not. He's praying.
- He's dying.

18:09.229 --> 18:11.431
The courage to change
the things I can...

18:11.564 --> 18:14.468
That prayer is what starts
every NA meeting.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.336
He is clinging
onto his sobriety.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.070
And the wisdom
to know the difference.

18:20.107 --> 18:21.384
And wisdom
to know the difference.

18:21.408 --> 18:22.986
He's admitting he doesn't
know what to do.

18:23.010 --> 18:23.876
He's asking God to help him.

18:24.011 --> 18:25.644
I'm helping him.
You can leave.

18:27.813 --> 18:29.493
Accepting hardship
as a pathway to peace...

18:33.220 --> 18:34.921
Living one day at a time...

18:36.822 --> 18:39.292
Enjoying one moment at a time...

18:39.426 --> 18:41.727
Forever in the next.
Amen.

18:51.071 --> 18:52.472
Forgive me.

18:59.513 --> 19:03.682
Accepting hardship
as a pathway to peace.

19:23.873 --> 19:26.075
We need to place the graft

19:26.208 --> 19:28.344
to replace the descending
and thoracic aorta.

19:28.476 --> 19:30.779
We need six more units of blood.

19:30.913 --> 19:32.715
I did a full exam
in the E.R.

19:32.848 --> 19:33.992
I mean, the imaging was clear.

19:34.016 --> 19:35.383
There were no signs
of dissection.

19:35.516 --> 19:37.853
Trim the distal aorta.

19:37.987 --> 19:41.190
It must have started
small enough to be undetected.

19:41.323 --> 19:43.123
His blood pressure
gradually expanded the tear

19:43.225 --> 19:44.225
until it ruptured.

19:48.496 --> 19:49.999
There's a false lumen.

19:50.132 --> 19:51.367
It extends past the carotid.

19:51.499 --> 19:52.835
The graft...

19:52.968 --> 19:53.968
won't work.

19:58.874 --> 20:00.709
Well, can you...

20:00.843 --> 20:03.178
Can you have
one of your visions?

20:03.312 --> 20:04.872
Come on, Shaun.
There must be something.

20:04.980 --> 20:06.348
For his family.

20:10.085 --> 20:12.721
He's lost more than half
his blood volume.

20:14.156 --> 20:17.726
His brain has been
underperfused for too long.

20:22.463 --> 20:23.531
Time of death...

20:25.566 --> 20:27.468
4:36 p.m.

20:34.310 --> 20:36.779
You might have mentioned
you were one of the organizers

20:36.912 --> 20:38.881
behind the nurses'
unionization push.

20:40.515 --> 20:41.984
Does it matter?

20:42.117 --> 20:44.153
Not to me, but the board
feels differently.

20:45.586 --> 20:47.423
Apparently,
our relationship is why

20:47.555 --> 20:50.059
I haven't been coming down hard
on the nurses.

20:50.192 --> 20:51.703
I can personally attest
that you've been

20:51.727 --> 20:53.395
a total pain about it
the whole time.

20:53.528 --> 20:56.131
Cute.
They're threatening my job.

20:59.802 --> 21:02.104
I don't want you to
lose your job over us.

21:02.237 --> 21:04.139
I don't want to lose you
over my job.

21:13.581 --> 21:15.851
You know, Shaun and Lea are
having their baby today.

21:15.985 --> 21:17.485
Yes, I'm aware.

21:17.618 --> 21:19.321
Have you talked to him?

21:19.455 --> 21:21.290
I said,
"Congratulations."

21:21.423 --> 21:22.903
Well, the alignment
looks much better,

21:23.025 --> 21:25.560
but she could have
horrible stenosis.

21:25.693 --> 21:27.429
Are you planning on
talking to him?

21:27.562 --> 21:29.031
Beyond one word?

21:29.164 --> 21:31.800
I'd decompress the C1
with a laminectomy.

21:35.603 --> 21:37.940
You know, a crotchety,
old, wise man once told me

21:38.073 --> 21:41.276
that hanging onto my anger
was toxic.

21:41.410 --> 21:42.444
I'm not "crotchety."

21:42.577 --> 21:43.577
You were right then.

21:43.678 --> 21:45.114
And I'm right now.

21:45.247 --> 21:47.449
He publicly humiliated me
yesterday,

21:47.582 --> 21:49.785
as everyone in this room
is quite well aware.

21:49.918 --> 21:51.652
Well, he's having
his baby today.

21:53.322 --> 21:56.859
Pass me two 28-mill
pedicle screws, please.

21:56.992 --> 21:59.028
- I'll take those.
- Right.

21:59.161 --> 22:00.528
Old habit.

22:11.306 --> 22:13.475
I saw your family
leave a while ago.

22:14.675 --> 22:16.478
Are they getting a hotel?

22:20.716 --> 22:21.984
You gave me fentanyl.

22:25.487 --> 22:26.487
I did.

22:28.757 --> 22:29.992
Was it a hard decision?

22:32.327 --> 22:33.594
Overriding my wishes?

22:35.330 --> 22:36.899
Honestly?

22:37.032 --> 22:38.032
No.

22:39.535 --> 22:42.004
You were on the verge
of a heart attack.

22:42.137 --> 22:44.572
- Or brain bleed.
- Yeah, but not definitively.

22:44.706 --> 22:48.944
I wasn't willing to risk your
life waiting for "definitively."

22:49.078 --> 22:51.847
But you were okay sending me
back to certain opiate addiction.

22:55.284 --> 22:56.284
I couldn't...

22:58.754 --> 23:00.322
let you die.

23:27.983 --> 23:30.552
I stopped by to offer
my nanny services.

23:30.685 --> 23:32.154
But it looks like
you're all set.

23:32.287 --> 23:34.056
I got all three participants
locked in.

23:34.189 --> 23:36.158
Trial's starting on time.

23:36.291 --> 23:38.327
Now I just need to tell Andrews
that I'm done.

23:39.561 --> 23:40.561
Done?

23:41.696 --> 23:42.898
With this job.

23:45.367 --> 23:48.003
Look, you've had a long day.

23:48.137 --> 23:50.772
But you'll find a rhythm.
And a nanny.

23:51.651 --> 23:53.954
I can't do this job
as well as I want

23:53.979 --> 23:55.539
and take care of Eden
as well as I need.

23:57.578 --> 24:01.282
I've made the mistake of putting my
career ahead of the people I love before.

24:01.626 --> 24:02.894
I'm not doing it again.

24:19.434 --> 24:22.171
The nurses put a chair
next to the table for you,

24:22.304 --> 24:24.006
if you would like to sit.

24:37.753 --> 24:39.388
Is it okay to touch him?

24:39.521 --> 24:41.023
Yes.

24:41.156 --> 24:42.491
Just don't remove the sheet.

25:03.180 --> 25:04.248
He was just here.

25:13.243 --> 25:15.078
How am I gonna tell my girls?

25:22.898 --> 25:26.868
I don't think I can do
any of this without him.

25:32.441 --> 25:34.476
When my brother Steve died,

25:36.211 --> 25:39.181
I didn't know
how I would survive.

25:41.016 --> 25:43.018
He had always taken care of me.

25:47.022 --> 25:48.023
But I did.

25:50.225 --> 25:52.761
Because someone else
came into my life

25:52.894 --> 25:54.630
who took care of me
and loved me.

26:00.135 --> 26:01.670
Now he may be gone, too.

26:10.362 --> 26:14.351
It is very hard to lose people
you thought would never leave.

26:16.918 --> 26:18.220
But you will...

26:20.613 --> 26:24.016
be okay
because you have no choice.

26:26.824 --> 26:29.029
When we lose people we love,

26:30.734 --> 26:32.870
we have to find a way
to keep going

26:32.895 --> 26:34.926
for the people we still have.

26:41.904 --> 26:43.770
Take as much time as you need.

26:48.720 --> 26:50.788
I'm going to have a baby now.

27:06.818 --> 27:08.353
You're back.

27:08.604 --> 27:09.872
How's the little girl?

27:11.509 --> 27:13.144
She will be okay.

27:16.147 --> 27:17.848
How far apart are
the contractions?

27:17.982 --> 27:19.517
About two minutes.

27:20.818 --> 27:22.421
Okay.

27:22.553 --> 27:24.956
It is time to start pushing.

27:25.523 --> 27:26.824
Are you sure?

27:26.958 --> 27:28.427
I don't... I don't feel anything.

27:28.559 --> 27:29.827
That's because of the epidural,

27:29.961 --> 27:31.762
but your prostaglandin E1
and E2 levels

27:31.896 --> 27:33.197
are at peak concentration

27:33.332 --> 27:35.766
for stimulating
myometrial contractility.

27:37.201 --> 27:38.201
It is time.

27:39.870 --> 27:42.640
I'll gown up and be right back.

27:42.773 --> 27:46.644
I will refill your water bottle
and get an extra pillow.

27:46.777 --> 27:48.713
Do you want a warm
or cold washcloth?

27:48.846 --> 27:52.083
Either is fine,
but I-I need more time.

27:52.216 --> 27:54.362
Delaying delivery can cause
excessive postpartum bleeding,

27:54.386 --> 27:55.986
plus an increase
in bacterial infections.

27:57.822 --> 27:59.690
I'll get one warm and one cold.

27:59.824 --> 28:01.959
Shaun, wait.
Come here a minute.

28:06.564 --> 28:07.564
I'm scared.

28:10.335 --> 28:12.036
Really, really scared.

28:12.169 --> 28:14.672
It is...

28:14.805 --> 28:16.874
common for women to be anxious

28:17.008 --> 28:19.110
about the birthing process.

28:20.878 --> 28:23.948
For nine months, my whole goal
was to keep this baby

28:24.081 --> 28:28.119
in my belly, safe
and sound and protected.

28:28.252 --> 28:31.522
And now it feels like
I'm supposed to just

28:31.655 --> 28:33.591
shove my own heart
into the world and...

28:33.724 --> 28:37.496
And let it walk around
all exposed and vulnerable

28:37.628 --> 28:39.331
and so, so tiny.

28:41.999 --> 28:46.971
And I'm not gonna be able
to protect him anymore.

28:53.277 --> 28:54.779
It will be okay.

28:58.115 --> 28:59.115
Probably.

29:03.854 --> 29:06.223
I am very excited
to meet our son.

29:08.125 --> 29:09.994
I'm really excited, too.

29:16.501 --> 29:17.502
Okay.

29:18.636 --> 29:21.005
Okay, let's... let's do this.

29:26.511 --> 29:27.812
Okay.

29:31.682 --> 29:33.294
You're two hours out of surgery.
Lie down.

29:33.318 --> 29:35.086
When can I get back to the home?

29:35.219 --> 29:36.754
I need to take your vitals.

29:39.890 --> 29:41.359
Want us to call your family?

29:41.493 --> 29:43.861
I got to call Martha.

29:43.994 --> 29:45.763
- Wife? Girlfriend?
- Neither.

29:45.896 --> 29:47.566
We take walks every morning

29:47.698 --> 29:50.402
with about 20 other old farts
from the home...

29:50.535 --> 29:53.838
All waking up to watch
the damn sunrise.

29:53.971 --> 29:56.240
Not your preferred activity?

29:56.374 --> 29:58.343
Doc, if God wanted us
to see the sunrise,

29:58.477 --> 30:00.911
he would have put it at
a more reasonable hour.

30:03.948 --> 30:05.883
You go because Martha's there.

30:09.019 --> 30:12.022
I think it's time I told her...

30:12.156 --> 30:14.359
she's the reason I wake up
in the morning.

30:19.296 --> 30:20.297
Let's give her a call.

30:22.467 --> 30:23.568
Thanks.

30:25.370 --> 30:26.904
You're all right, Doc.

30:38.716 --> 30:40.385
I went through
my patient record.

30:42.052 --> 30:43.087
You made the right call.

30:47.224 --> 30:48.224
Thank you.

30:49.594 --> 30:50.595
But...

30:52.796 --> 30:55.299
I'm going to need all the help
I can get to recover

30:55.433 --> 30:57.101
without relapsing.

31:02.806 --> 31:04.309
I...

31:04.442 --> 31:08.012
need to go back to Texas
with my family.

31:11.416 --> 31:14.785
I knew when I gave you
the drugs,

31:14.919 --> 31:15.920
I might lose you.

31:18.189 --> 31:20.124
And it wasn't a hard decision?

31:20.257 --> 31:21.892
The decision was easy.

31:23.994 --> 31:25.129
The aftermath is...

31:31.636 --> 31:33.676
Well, I'm not going anywhere
until we have our date.

31:35.806 --> 31:37.642
Are you free tonight?

31:43.515 --> 31:46.283
The levator ani muscle is
undergoing a stretch ratio

31:46.418 --> 31:49.321
of 3.26, which is normal.

31:49.454 --> 31:51.423
Shaun, I need you up here,
not down there.

31:53.023 --> 31:54.659
Why isn't he coming out?

31:54.792 --> 31:56.432
The little guy is
just progressing slowly.

31:56.461 --> 31:57.904
I think we need a vacuum
assist to help...

31:57.928 --> 31:59.464
You want to vacuum
my baby out of me?

31:59.598 --> 32:00.665
It is standard protocol

32:00.798 --> 32:02.467
if a baby is stalled
in the birth canal.

32:02.601 --> 32:04.211
I covered this in the e-mail
about instrum...

32:04.235 --> 32:05.836
There were a lot
of e-mails, Shaun.

32:05.970 --> 32:07.439
Okay.

32:09.006 --> 32:10.174
Is it safe for the baby?

32:12.510 --> 32:13.578
Will he have a cone-head?

32:15.813 --> 32:17.682
Only for approximately 48 hours.

32:19.049 --> 32:20.452
Okay, mama.
You ready?

32:24.121 --> 32:26.558
I am here for you.

32:26.691 --> 32:28.225
You can squeeze my hand.

32:42.921 --> 32:45.425
You're doing great.
He's almost here.

32:55.694 --> 32:57.315
Congratulations, Mom and Dad.

33:05.664 --> 33:08.600
I can't believe
you're finally here, Peanut.

33:09.904 --> 33:11.738
He doesn't look like
an alien at all.

33:12.872 --> 33:16.911
His... head has
a very nice shape.

33:17.044 --> 33:19.179
Yeah.

33:19.313 --> 33:20.546
He is beautiful.

33:24.051 --> 33:26.086
Dr. Murphy, would you like
to do the honors?

33:26.220 --> 33:28.721
Yes.

33:28.855 --> 33:31.362
I would very much
like to do that.

33:35.528 --> 33:36.863
Hi.

33:43.536 --> 33:44.871
Look at what we made.

33:48.775 --> 33:50.277
Hello.

33:50.411 --> 33:52.445
It is very nice to meet you.

33:53.880 --> 33:55.715
I am Dr. Shaun Murphy.

33:59.686 --> 34:00.921
I'm your dad.

34:11.065 --> 34:14.168
You think anybody would notice
if we took this home with us?

34:14.301 --> 34:15.467
I think you should leave it.

34:17.036 --> 34:18.438
I wasn't really going
to take it.

34:18.571 --> 34:20.473
Sure you were.

34:20.606 --> 34:21.909
But...

34:23.010 --> 34:24.290
I don't think you should resign.

34:26.846 --> 34:28.485
Because you don't have to
do it all alone.

34:33.454 --> 34:35.289
You're the reason
I wake up in the morning.

34:38.458 --> 34:40.027
So, whatever there is
to figure out,

34:40.159 --> 34:42.628
all I want in the world is
for us to do it as a family.

34:55.275 --> 34:56.409
I love you, too.

34:58.946 --> 35:00.247
She has a dirty diaper.

35:00.381 --> 35:02.648
And I have 30 lab reports
to review.

35:18.198 --> 35:19.400
Thank you...

35:21.035 --> 35:22.035
for saving my life.

35:23.636 --> 35:24.938
You're very welcome.

35:25.838 --> 35:28.976
I-I, um... I didn't mean today.

35:31.311 --> 35:34.547
I meant when you made looking
for a foot in a lake fun.

35:36.283 --> 35:39.319
When you sat next to me
in church, quietly,

35:39.453 --> 35:40.988
knowing that was
exactly what I needed.

35:43.090 --> 35:46.226
And, when you trusted me...

35:48.462 --> 35:50.342
even though I'm pretty sure
I didn't deserve it.

35:52.698 --> 35:54.834
And, of course, today.

35:58.871 --> 36:00.807
You make me believe
that I can do this.

36:09.516 --> 36:11.018
You will be okay.

36:19.859 --> 36:21.428
I'm gonna miss you.

36:37.177 --> 36:38.512
Thank you.

36:41.915 --> 36:43.383
I love a sunset
as much as anyone,

36:43.517 --> 36:46.320
but isn't this a little
sentiment over science?

36:46.453 --> 36:48.821
There's a case study
out of Alabama...

36:48.956 --> 36:51.258
Internal decapitation.

36:51.391 --> 36:53.626
They took the patient out
every night...

36:53.759 --> 36:56.662
Sunset, beautiful sky,
and fresh air

36:56.796 --> 36:58.465
to help stimulate the brain.

37:00.334 --> 37:02.702
How long before they got
a response?

37:02.835 --> 37:05.738
A couple days, but it worked.

37:05.872 --> 37:09.076
Hey, how can you argue with a
thing called "Operation Sunset"?

37:13.413 --> 37:14.581
Your family is coming.

37:15.949 --> 37:20.087
I know they'd love to see
you smile, or even a blink.

37:22.623 --> 37:23.991
Or you could just flip us off

37:24.124 --> 37:26.044
because you're cold
and you're afraid of heights.

37:29.729 --> 37:31.249
You've got your methods,
I've got mine.

37:31.298 --> 37:33.133
Whatever works.

37:36.869 --> 37:38.172
Shaun and Lea had their baby.

37:40.806 --> 37:42.808
Do you want to go meet him?

37:44.978 --> 37:46.547
I think I'll stay here.
Thank you.

37:52.352 --> 37:55.522
I know that losing surgery
is devastating.

37:57.191 --> 38:00.127
Don't let losing one great love
cost you another.

38:25.986 --> 38:28.155
I wanted to give you
a heads-up, as a friend.

38:30.790 --> 38:32.159
I've decided to resign.

38:33.627 --> 38:34.627
Seriously?

38:35.596 --> 38:36.596
Yeah.

38:54.581 --> 38:56.250
Do you think Dr. Glassman
is coming?

38:59.253 --> 39:01.388
Let's take a picture
before my adrenaline wears off

39:01.521 --> 39:02.522
and I pass out.

39:02.656 --> 39:04.191
I'll get the hats.

39:05.058 --> 39:06.393
I would love the honor

39:06.526 --> 39:08.362
of taking
the first family photo.

39:31.585 --> 39:33.420
Hi, baby.

39:38.191 --> 39:39.792
- Okay.
- Take a good picture.

39:39.926 --> 39:42.629
Hey, baby boy Murphy.
Smile for your big debut.

39:42.763 --> 39:47.034
Three, two, one, cheese.

39:48.035 --> 39:50.570
Beautiful.

40:01.948 --> 40:03.450
Hi.

40:04.618 --> 40:06.320
Hi, baby.

40:09.589 --> 40:11.258
This is from
Dr. Glassman.

40:41.822 --> 40:43.957
How did he know
his name would be Steve?

40:47.160 --> 40:48.261
Because he knows you.

41:22.162 --> 41:26.066
Steven Aaron Murphy.

41:29.202 --> 41:31.872
This is a gift
from your grandfather.
