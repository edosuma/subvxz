WEBVTT

00:28.129 --> 00:32.300
- Bosch.
- Bosch. Iverson.

00:32.300 --> 00:33.267
Iverson.

00:35.136 --> 00:37.238
It's fuckin' 4:00
in the morning.

00:37.238 --> 00:39.440
We got a search warrant for
Lucky Rykoff's place.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.709
We're executing it now.

00:40.709 --> 00:43.044
Rykoff?
From the strip joint?

00:43.044 --> 00:45.213
Yeah, your pal.
Joey Marks' guy.

00:45.213 --> 00:46.981
How the hell did you
get a warrant?

00:46.981 --> 00:48.917
Got a hit on those prints
you asked us to run.

00:48.917 --> 00:53.221
You found Rykoff's prints
on Tony Allen's jacket?

00:53.221 --> 00:55.389
I'll text you the address
if you want to join us.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.792
Or maybe you just
want to go back to bed.

00:57.792 --> 00:59.628
Don't do anything
before I get there.

00:59.628 --> 01:01.663
We're not
waiting on you, Bosch.

01:01.663 --> 01:03.798
Asshole.

01:28.389 --> 01:29.390
Iverson.

01:29.390 --> 01:30.892
Sit tight.

01:30.892 --> 01:32.026
- Bosch.
- Come here.

01:32.026 --> 01:33.394
What the hell
are you doing?

01:33.394 --> 01:35.697
- SWAT?
- I thought you'd be pleased.

01:35.697 --> 01:37.966
How about we
talk to the guy first.

01:37.966 --> 01:39.768
Just because
we found his prints
on Allen's jacket

01:39.768 --> 01:41.035
doesn't mean he killed him.

01:41.035 --> 01:42.871
Rykoff's been on our radar.

01:42.871 --> 01:44.673
Drugs, prostitution.

01:44.673 --> 01:46.340
And if he killed Allen--

01:46.340 --> 01:49.077
Look, we get what we need,
you might get what you need.

01:49.077 --> 01:50.679
Just what is it
that you need?

01:50.679 --> 01:53.347
Joey Marks.
And Rykoff can get us there.

01:53.347 --> 01:55.216
This is bullshit.
This is my case.

01:55.216 --> 01:56.918
You're Bigfooting me on this
for some glory.

01:56.918 --> 01:58.252
You know something,
asshole,

01:58.252 --> 02:00.689
you should be happy
I invited you to the party.

02:00.689 --> 02:02.190
You're pissed
I broke it open.

02:02.190 --> 02:05.526
All right, boys,
saddle up. Let's go.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.528
Let's go.
Move it out.

03:15.764 --> 03:17.065
- Go! Go!
- We've got movement

03:17.065 --> 03:18.532
in the rear bedroom.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.334
I repeat, we've got movement
in the rear bedroom.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.773
- Get on the floor!
- Okay, okay, okay.

03:24.773 --> 03:27.876
- Get down on the floor!
- Okay. Harmony, calm down.

03:27.876 --> 03:28.977
On the floor!

03:28.977 --> 03:31.479
Off the bed,
on the floor!

03:31.479 --> 03:32.947
Settle down, all right?

03:32.947 --> 03:34.148
Hey, be cool man,
all right?

03:34.148 --> 03:35.383
All right, all right,
all right.

03:35.383 --> 03:36.617
Put your hands
behind your back.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.186
Hey, Pinky,
be cool.

03:38.186 --> 03:39.420
Okay, baby.

03:39.420 --> 03:43.291
- Harmony, relax.
- I am. Ouch! Asshole.

03:43.291 --> 03:46.060
You want to tell me
what the fuck this is about?

03:46.060 --> 03:47.028
Ahh!

03:48.863 --> 03:52.000
**

04:10.819 --> 04:13.554
* I got a feelin'
that I can't let go *

04:13.554 --> 04:16.290
* I got a feelin'
that I can't let go *

04:16.290 --> 04:19.027
* I got a feelin'
that I can't let go *

04:19.027 --> 04:21.562

that I can't let go *

04:21.562 --> 04:24.398

04:24.398 --> 04:26.500
* Got a feelin'
that I can't let go *

04:26.500 --> 04:29.503
* I got a feelin'
that I can't let go *

04:29.503 --> 04:32.506
* Can't let go *

04:32.506 --> 04:35.443
**

04:49.190 --> 04:50.458
We'll handle
the search.

04:50.458 --> 04:51.759
Stick around and
keep an eye on locking up.

04:51.759 --> 04:52.994
Roger that.

04:52.994 --> 04:55.596
Let's keep this tight,
Iverson.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.871
Sorry to fuck up
your beauty sleep, ladies.

05:11.079 --> 05:13.915
Mr. LAPD.

05:13.915 --> 05:15.683
What, is this payback
for the other night?

05:15.683 --> 05:16.985
We're gonna take
a look around.

05:16.985 --> 05:18.920
You're not gonna
find anything.

05:20.221 --> 05:22.356
Fuck, this isn't about
Tony Allen, is it?

05:22.356 --> 05:24.325
Man, I haven't left Vegas
in months.

05:24.325 --> 05:26.427
I'm tellin' you
I wasn't in L.A.
the night he got killed.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.396
- I can prove that shit.
- Put a plug in it.

05:28.396 --> 05:30.531
You can tell us your story
down at the station.

06:26.955 --> 06:29.223
Iverson!
In here.

06:29.223 --> 06:31.792
Hey, sorry I forgot to flush.
There's a drought and all.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.464
Well, well, well.
Bingo.

06:36.464 --> 06:40.534
- .22.
- That what you were
lookin' for?

06:45.974 --> 06:49.477
Who's lucky now?

06:50.979 --> 06:53.381
We found your gun,
asshole.

06:53.381 --> 06:55.383
What's that?
That's not my gun.

06:55.383 --> 06:57.185
Get him dressed.
Where you're goin',

06:57.185 --> 06:58.586
you're gonna want to wear
more than that, big fella.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.454
What the fuck
are you doin', man?

07:00.454 --> 07:01.755
Listen to me,

07:01.755 --> 07:03.624
he was in there first,
he was in there by himself.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.793
He planted that shit.
That is not my gun.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.328
Bullshit.

07:07.328 --> 07:09.397
Hey, that's not
my fuckin' gun, man.

07:09.397 --> 07:11.565
You know it's not
my fuckin' gun.

07:13.467 --> 07:16.037
Oh, man.

07:21.175 --> 07:22.310
He seemed surprised.

07:22.310 --> 07:24.112
Surprised we found it.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.881
What?

07:27.881 --> 07:29.783
It ain't right.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.152
Why would he keep it?

07:31.152 --> 07:33.221
He whacks Allen in L.A.,
he pitches the gun,

07:33.221 --> 07:34.588
throws it down
a storm drain.

07:34.588 --> 07:37.291
Maybe his mama
gave it to him
for his birthday.

07:37.291 --> 07:40.661
Who knows.
If they weren't idiots,
we wouldn't catch 'em.

07:40.661 --> 07:43.164
Yeah, right.

07:43.164 --> 07:44.465
It's too easy.

07:44.465 --> 07:46.100
Let's confirm it's
the murder weapon,

07:46.100 --> 07:48.036
then decide
how easy it is.

08:26.774 --> 08:29.243
Usual?

08:29.243 --> 08:31.679
Yeah.
Chatty motherfucker
in the morning.

08:44.092 --> 08:46.327
That all today, officer?

08:46.327 --> 08:49.430
Oh, I got to have some
Krispy Kremes, too.

08:49.430 --> 08:50.598
Mm-hm.

08:52.533 --> 08:54.102
Ah, yeah.

08:55.503 --> 08:59.240
Mm.
Have a blessed day.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.543
Asshole.

09:02.543 --> 09:05.546
She knows that we
go all the way back
to the academy.

09:05.546 --> 09:07.115
Well, then,
she's cool with me, right?

09:07.115 --> 09:09.450
Yeah, she's cool.

09:09.450 --> 09:13.287
Just play it straight.
Be yourself.

09:13.287 --> 09:15.123
Yeah,
what do I call her?

09:15.123 --> 09:17.958
- Mo.
- Mo?

09:17.958 --> 09:19.293
Yeah, call her Mo.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.332
I'm chill, man.

09:24.332 --> 09:25.766
And don't say chill,
either.

09:37.044 --> 09:39.547
Hey. How are you?

09:40.748 --> 09:43.184
Too blessed to be stressed,
baby. How are you?

09:43.184 --> 09:44.785
I'm good.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.720
This is George.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.156
I figured.

09:48.156 --> 09:49.757
It's nice
to meet you, Mo.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.825
Don't call me Mo.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.797
All right.

09:58.699 --> 09:59.867
How are you?

09:59.867 --> 10:01.869
I'm good.

10:03.137 --> 10:05.773
Wednesday night.
Plans?

10:05.773 --> 10:06.874
No. Wide open.

10:08.576 --> 10:10.878
- Eddie's got the details.
- All right.

10:10.878 --> 10:13.747
I shouldn't have to tell you
to keep your mouth shut,
but I will.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.649
Ah, shit, I'm chill.

10:23.524 --> 10:25.526
You and Dad.
How often you see him?

10:25.526 --> 10:26.794
Oh, shit, I don't know.

10:26.794 --> 10:29.730
Uh, every couple weeks
I go by to see my mom.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.799
Sometimes I see him,
sometimes I don't.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.702
You ever talk about work?

10:34.702 --> 10:35.869
If he asks.

10:38.906 --> 10:41.442
How would you feel about
doing a little more of that?

10:41.442 --> 10:42.910
A little more what?

10:42.910 --> 10:44.212
Talkin' shop with Pop?

10:46.214 --> 10:47.548
It's no problem.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.922
All right.
See ya, Eddie.

10:54.922 --> 10:55.923
Later.

10:59.360 --> 11:01.829
God, shit, man.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.997
- What?
- I said chill.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.366
Goddamn.

11:07.235 --> 11:09.603
Don't sweat it.
She liked you.

11:09.603 --> 11:12.273
Yeah, all right.
How could you tell?

11:12.273 --> 11:14.242
- I can tell.
- Uh-huh.

11:14.242 --> 11:16.744
But you.
You have got to chill.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.279
Oh, that's right.

11:27.154 --> 11:28.422
We'll be back.

11:28.422 --> 11:29.557
I need a cup of coffee
or something.

11:29.557 --> 11:30.724
It's been a long night.

11:30.724 --> 11:32.860
Ah, cocaine's
wearing off?

11:32.860 --> 11:33.927
Tough shit.

11:43.170 --> 11:44.305
Fuck.

11:44.305 --> 11:45.373
I know you got history
with this guy,

11:45.373 --> 11:46.607
but I should take
the lead here.

11:46.607 --> 11:47.975
I'm not comfortable
with that.

11:47.975 --> 11:50.411
Anything local comes up,
you give me the high sign,

11:50.411 --> 11:51.479
I'll let you step in.

11:51.479 --> 11:52.846
The whole thing
is local, Bosch.

11:52.846 --> 11:55.549
Tony Allen lived in L.A.
He was killed there, also.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.818
And his killer's
right here in Vegas
in there.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.320
Maybe.

11:59.320 --> 12:00.854
Look,
professional courtesy.

12:00.854 --> 12:03.056
It's my murder,
I talk to him first.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.558
Up to the captain.

12:04.558 --> 12:05.993
We'll see how he wants to
handle the others.

12:05.993 --> 12:07.495
What others?

12:07.495 --> 12:10.163
Captain invited some known
associates of Joey Marks

12:10.163 --> 12:11.699
to come in for a chat.

12:11.699 --> 12:13.667
Your buddy Billy
from the titty bar.

12:13.667 --> 12:15.669
Allen's poker pal
at the Mirage.

12:15.669 --> 12:17.037
What the hell's
she doing here?

12:17.037 --> 12:18.606
They ID'd her
off her comp card.

12:18.606 --> 12:20.641
You're saying she's
an associate of Joey Marks?

12:20.641 --> 12:22.476
- It's in her file.
- It's a mistake.

12:22.476 --> 12:23.811
Is she under arrest?

12:23.811 --> 12:26.314
Came in of her own accord.
Voluntarily.

12:26.314 --> 12:27.715
You said
you didn't know her.

12:27.715 --> 12:28.749
Piss off.

12:33.887 --> 12:35.188
What am I doing here,
Harry?

12:35.188 --> 12:36.457
Is this about Tony Allen?

12:36.457 --> 12:38.426
Careful what you say.
We're on camera.

12:38.426 --> 12:39.660
What'd they tell you?

12:39.660 --> 12:40.761
They didn't tell me anything.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.530
They just threatened
our business,

12:42.530 --> 12:45.098
talking about mob ties and
pulling our casino license.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.400
It's bullshit.

12:46.400 --> 12:47.801
Did you know about this?

12:47.801 --> 12:49.737
Don't lie to me, Harry.
Is this about your case?

12:49.737 --> 12:51.539
Let me talk to the captain,
get this sorted out.

12:51.539 --> 12:53.707
- I'll be right back.
- Jesus, Harry.

12:59.347 --> 13:02.249
But don't worry.
It's under control.

13:02.249 --> 13:03.584
- Yes.
- Captain.

13:03.584 --> 13:05.252
That woman you brought in,
Eleanor Wish,

13:05.252 --> 13:08.188
she's got nothin' to do
with this case.

13:08.188 --> 13:09.490
Let me call you back.

13:12.059 --> 13:13.394
And how do you know that?

13:13.394 --> 13:16.397
I interviewed her yesterday
about Allen.

13:16.397 --> 13:17.598
You interviewed.

13:17.598 --> 13:20.401
She didn't even know
his last name.

13:20.401 --> 13:22.002
Iverson,
get a cup of coffee.

13:28.075 --> 13:30.611
I want her kicked loose.

13:32.413 --> 13:34.114
Because she's
your ex-wife?

13:34.114 --> 13:36.517
No, because she's got
nothin' to do with this.
Any of it.

13:36.517 --> 13:38.018
Well, you don't
get to decide that.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.654
You should have told us
how you knew her, detective.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.556
But you went about it
the wrong way.

13:42.556 --> 13:44.091
You should have been
straight up with us.

13:44.091 --> 13:45.258
What do you want,
Captain?

13:45.258 --> 13:46.427
I want to know what
your ex-wife knows

13:46.427 --> 13:48.396
about Joey Marks
and his organization.

13:48.396 --> 13:51.399
Nothing. She played poker
once in a while with Allen,
that's it.

13:51.399 --> 13:54.101
She ever mention a guy
named Tim Kirsch?

13:54.101 --> 13:55.302
Who's that?

13:55.302 --> 13:56.737
He puts money
on the streets for Marks.

13:56.737 --> 13:58.739
He makes sure
he gets paid back.

13:58.739 --> 14:00.007
What's he got to do
with Eleanor?

14:00.007 --> 14:02.242
She's been seen with him
over the years.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.545
Enough contact to
open a file on her.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.716
So how do we fix this?

14:08.716 --> 14:10.117
Make us part
of the case.

14:10.117 --> 14:11.318
Beginning to end.

14:11.318 --> 14:14.788
If Rykoff did this,
he did it for Marks.

14:14.788 --> 14:16.590
You're using my ex wife
to leverage me

14:16.590 --> 14:18.426
to get to Joey Marks.

14:18.426 --> 14:20.293
What, you get the glory,
we get the paperwork

14:20.293 --> 14:21.695
while you ride off
into the sunset

14:21.695 --> 14:23.997
with a guy we've been
chasing for years?

14:23.997 --> 14:25.699
No, that doesn't fly.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.034
Come on,
make it official.

14:29.169 --> 14:31.772
Let me call my lieutenant,
buy you onto the case.

14:31.772 --> 14:34.007
- I want to talk to him.
- Her.

14:34.007 --> 14:35.743
Whatever.

14:37.745 --> 14:40.714
- Hey, thanks, sweetheart.
- You're welcome.

14:40.714 --> 14:44.051
I need you to do a cover sheet
and fax this.

14:44.051 --> 14:46.253
- Okay.
- All right, and wait for
confirmation.

14:46.253 --> 14:47.521
Roger that.

14:47.521 --> 14:49.957
Ooh, pickin' up the lingo.
Good for you.

14:49.957 --> 14:52.359
- 10-4, Lieutenant.
- Yeah.

14:54.495 --> 14:56.263
Harry. How's it going?

14:56.263 --> 14:58.732
There's been an arrest
in the Allen murder.

14:58.732 --> 15:01.635
Luke Rykoff.
He runs a strip club
for Joey Marks.

15:01.635 --> 15:03.036
You like him for it?

15:03.036 --> 15:04.872
Well, they do.

15:04.872 --> 15:07.975
I'm here with Captain Felton
of Las Vegas Metro.

15:07.975 --> 15:09.943
We think we should make it
a joint investigation.

15:09.943 --> 15:12.480
You want to share
the investigation?

15:12.480 --> 15:16.283
What, has he got
a pair of pliers
clamped to your nut sack?

15:16.283 --> 15:18.852
As we speak.

15:18.852 --> 15:21.221
All right,
put him on the fucking phone.

15:21.221 --> 15:22.790
Thank you, Lieutenant.

15:22.790 --> 15:26.994
Captain Felton.
Lieutenant Billets.

15:26.994 --> 15:28.562
Sorry to disturb you,
Lieutenant.

15:28.562 --> 15:30.097
No, not at all,
Captain.

15:30.097 --> 15:33.734
Um, the last thing
we want to do is
tread on your turf.

15:33.734 --> 15:35.703
I'm fine with the
joint investigation.

15:35.703 --> 15:37.337
I'm glad to hear it.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.540
And thank you for
your cooperation.

15:39.540 --> 15:41.709
Good luck.

15:45.312 --> 15:46.680
Thank you, Lieutenant.

15:46.680 --> 15:49.182
Don't let him
fuck up our case.

15:49.182 --> 15:50.150
Roger that.

15:52.620 --> 15:55.255
I need to talk to Eleanor
before I interview Rykoff.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.525
So talk to her.

15:57.525 --> 15:59.527
- And she goes free.
- As a bird.

16:05.966 --> 16:07.535
Does he not know
he's an asshole,

16:07.535 --> 16:08.836
or does he
just not care?

16:08.836 --> 16:09.970
Both.

16:19.580 --> 16:21.048
Did you get it
straightened out?

16:21.048 --> 16:22.282
I did.

16:22.282 --> 16:23.584
So, can I go home now?

16:23.584 --> 16:26.253
Tell me about
Tim Kirsch.

16:26.253 --> 16:28.856
I borrowed money from him,
paid him back. That's it.

16:28.856 --> 16:31.592
Jesus Christ, Eleanor.
A loan shark who works
for Joey Marks?

16:31.592 --> 16:34.094
- That's why they
brought me in?
- What they said.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.996
- Do you know Marks?
- I know of him.

16:35.996 --> 16:38.566
Look, it's garbage,
Harry.

16:38.566 --> 16:40.668
I talked to the captain.
You're going home.

16:40.668 --> 16:42.670
But he wants to know about
you and Kirsch first.

16:42.670 --> 16:44.037
He does or you do?

16:46.006 --> 16:47.575
I haven't seen Kirsch
in years.

16:47.575 --> 16:48.842
Before we moved
to Hong Kong.

16:48.842 --> 16:50.578
How much did you borrow,
Eleanor?

16:50.578 --> 16:52.646
A lot.

16:52.646 --> 16:54.815
I needed to
get back on my feet
and start over.

16:54.815 --> 16:56.584
Did you know
he worked for Marks?

16:56.584 --> 16:59.452
Not for a fact,
but I knew other players
who borrowed from him.

16:59.452 --> 17:00.688
That was
good enough for me.

17:00.688 --> 17:02.422
Did you know
he was a criminal?

17:02.422 --> 17:05.092
Look, I didn't think he was
a loan officer at Wells Fargo,

17:05.092 --> 17:07.795
but I paid him back
with interest, end of story.

17:10.230 --> 17:11.431
Can I go now?

17:11.431 --> 17:13.233
I'll get a uniform
to take you home.

17:34.955 --> 17:36.924
You handle
the paperwork?

17:36.924 --> 17:39.627
Yeah, but we're not even
halfway done with our shift.

17:39.627 --> 17:40.961
I got places to be, man.

17:40.961 --> 17:42.630
- Uh-huh.
- Hm.

17:42.630 --> 17:44.364
So, what do I tell
the lieutenant?

17:44.364 --> 17:45.799
I don't know,
tell him--

17:45.799 --> 17:48.235
tell him it was a slow day
on the war on drugs.

17:48.235 --> 17:49.336
There were no busts.

17:49.336 --> 17:51.138
You tell him
that we know

17:51.138 --> 17:54.107
that the system's
already overflowing like
a backed up latrine,

17:54.107 --> 17:55.743
and that we don't want to
stress it any further

17:55.743 --> 17:57.410
by hauling in a bunch of
dime bag turds.

17:57.410 --> 18:00.247
- Mm. Dime bag turds.
All right.
- Yeah.

18:00.247 --> 18:02.182
- Oh, you know what?
- Yeah. Huh?

18:02.182 --> 18:05.085
You tell him that there's
peace in the valley.

18:07.020 --> 18:08.756
You're a crazy
motherfucker, man.

18:08.756 --> 18:11.291
Peace.
In the valley.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.927
All right.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.796
Shit.

18:15.796 --> 18:17.230
Peace in the valley.

18:23.737 --> 18:26.707
Ten part beef,
one part pork for sticky,

18:26.707 --> 18:29.442
three part onions
grounded up with salt,

18:29.442 --> 18:32.713
black pepper,
let sit 24 hours.

18:37.751 --> 18:39.286
You Petrossian?

18:39.286 --> 18:40.420
Hey. You Edgar?

18:40.420 --> 18:41.554
Hey.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.590
Two kabob.
He's paying.

18:43.590 --> 18:44.758
I am?

18:44.758 --> 18:46.026
Yeah, peace offering.

18:46.026 --> 18:49.362
LAPD, Glendale PD.
Like Turks and Armenians.

18:49.362 --> 18:50.497
And we're the Turks.

18:50.497 --> 18:53.466
Hey, you catch on quick
for a Turk.

18:53.466 --> 18:54.735
First thing
you need to know,

18:54.735 --> 18:56.704
Tony Allen and Joey Marks
were cousins.

18:56.704 --> 18:58.138
No shit?

18:58.138 --> 19:00.908
Tony's born here.
Marks is older,
born in Armenia.

19:00.908 --> 19:04.111
Marks was what we call
"rabise," flashy, violent.

19:04.111 --> 19:06.413
Got into business with
the Russians here,
then Vegas.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.716
Hm. Tony?

19:08.716 --> 19:10.317
Soft. "Amrekyan."

19:10.317 --> 19:12.119
Never had the stomach
for the rough stuff,

19:12.119 --> 19:14.855
but a magician
when it comes to dirty money.

19:14.855 --> 19:16.757
How big is Marks in Vegas?

19:16.757 --> 19:18.391
Middling.
The real players
are the Russians.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.193
See, that's who the Feds
are worried about.

19:20.193 --> 19:23.130
Even they don't care that much
about the rackets anymore.

19:23.130 --> 19:25.165
Except how they
fund terrorism.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.034
And Broff is planning on
blowing up a building?

19:27.034 --> 19:29.803
The Broff does business
with people who are.

19:29.803 --> 19:31.972
Hezbollah, ISIS.

19:31.972 --> 19:33.741
The Middle East.

19:33.741 --> 19:36.476
Hell of a lot closer
than that, pal. Mexico.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.912
What-- what,
ISIS is in Mexico?

19:38.912 --> 19:41.181
Hezbollah is.
And Detroit.

19:41.181 --> 19:43.751
I'm telling you, bro,
this shit's right under
our noses.

19:46.920 --> 19:49.122
Hey, let's, uh,
go eat outside, huh?

19:49.122 --> 19:51.759
I'll tell you how to marinate
real Armenian kabobs.

19:59.266 --> 20:02.569
I don't know.
The-the night that Allen
got in my face about Layla,

20:02.569 --> 20:05.138
he put his hands on me,
and I had to get physical.

20:05.138 --> 20:06.006
How so?

20:06.006 --> 20:07.174
I don't know,
I grabbed him,

20:07.174 --> 20:08.541
I threw him out
by the fucking collar.

20:08.541 --> 20:09.777
Anybody witness this?

20:09.777 --> 20:11.244
I don't know,
about a dozen strippers,

20:11.244 --> 20:13.213
happened in the
dressing room.

20:13.213 --> 20:15.615
And that gun you fuckers
planted on me.

20:15.615 --> 20:18.051
- Seriously?
- You're stickin'
with that story?

20:18.051 --> 20:20.353
Oh, I'm gonna take
a murder wrap over
a $200 throwaway?

20:20.353 --> 20:22.823
How stupid do you think I am?
I mean, this shit's ridiculous.

20:22.823 --> 20:24.858
And yet,
here we are.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.096
Fuck off.
I didn't kill Tony Allen.

20:29.096 --> 20:30.998
Why'd Joey Marks
order the hit on him?

20:30.998 --> 20:32.265
He didn't.
You got nothin'.

20:32.265 --> 20:34.334
Stop treating me like
a donkey and fuck off.

20:34.334 --> 20:37.771
You know what?
Book me and get me to
a fuckin' phone.

20:39.272 --> 20:40.974
We'll go the distance
on you, Lucky.

20:40.974 --> 20:43.343
Oh, yeah,
and stick that smile
up your ass,

20:43.343 --> 20:44.611
you fat fuck.

20:52.185 --> 20:53.286
Fuck.

20:53.286 --> 20:55.688
I'll take the gun
back to L.A. tomorrow.

20:55.688 --> 20:56.957
How quick can you
get it done?

20:56.957 --> 20:59.026
I'll walk it through
ballistics myself.

20:59.026 --> 21:02.062
My partner's already been
talking to the D.A.

21:02.062 --> 21:03.931
If we get a match,
we'll get a warrant.

21:03.931 --> 21:05.332
One day, tops.

21:05.332 --> 21:07.367
Let me know as soon
as you file in L.A.

21:07.367 --> 21:10.270
I'll call our D.A.'s office
and schedule a hearing.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.438
Thank you.

21:25.919 --> 21:27.720
Hi, it's Eleanor.
Leave a message.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.356
Hey, it's me.

21:29.356 --> 21:31.925
I'm just checking in to see
if you got home all right.

21:31.925 --> 21:33.526
I'm headed back to L.A.
tomorrow.

21:33.526 --> 21:35.295
I was wondering if
we could have some time

21:35.295 --> 21:38.866
to talk face to face tonight.

21:38.866 --> 21:41.434
Sorry you got mixed up
in all of this.

21:41.434 --> 21:42.535
Kiss Maddie for me.

21:47.407 --> 21:51.378
Yeah, the question is
who the fuck knows.

21:51.378 --> 21:54.081
Joey's not gonna give a shit
one way or the other.

21:54.081 --> 21:57.184
You know what
I'm gonna have to do
up in here, right?

21:57.184 --> 21:59.386
Man, just get me
fuckin' out of here
tomorrow morning.

21:59.386 --> 22:00.487
You got it?

22:03.123 --> 22:04.191
Fuck.

22:16.904 --> 22:18.939
What's up?

22:18.939 --> 22:20.473
What'd you say to me?

22:20.473 --> 22:21.909
Nothin'.

22:23.543 --> 22:24.945
Fuck you, bitch.

22:35.155 --> 22:37.157
All right, all right.
Break it up. Break it up!

22:38.959 --> 22:42.429
Fuck you!
What the fuck did you
say to me, bitch?

22:42.429 --> 22:45.598
- What the fuck did you
say to me?

23:07.187 --> 23:08.989
Hi, it's Eleanor.
Leave a message.

23:15.362 --> 23:17.230
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, Mads.

23:17.230 --> 23:19.532
- Whatcha doin'?
- Watching "Grey's Anatomy."

23:19.532 --> 23:20.667
That's still on?

23:20.667 --> 23:23.170
I'm streaming it.
Season 7.

23:23.170 --> 23:25.838
Hey, is your mom around?
I'm trying to reach her.

23:25.838 --> 23:30.077
She went to bed early.
She said she had a tough day.

23:30.077 --> 23:32.045
I'm going back
to L.A. tomorrow.

23:32.045 --> 23:33.880
I've hardly seen you.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.682
Try and stop by
in the morning.

23:35.682 --> 23:37.384
Okay. Love you.

23:37.384 --> 23:38.518
I love you, too.

23:38.518 --> 23:39.486
Bye.

24:10.017 --> 24:11.451
Detective.

24:11.451 --> 24:13.420
Detective Bosch, uh,
do you have a minute?

24:16.789 --> 24:18.225
Get in the car.

24:18.225 --> 24:20.727
Sit with him
where I can see you.

24:20.727 --> 24:22.129
Go ahead.

24:26.599 --> 24:28.135
What can I do for you?

24:28.135 --> 24:30.470
You, uh, don't want to
come out of the sun, Detective?

24:30.470 --> 24:32.072
No, I'm fine.

24:32.072 --> 24:34.107
Well, my name is
Marty Weiss,

24:34.107 --> 24:35.275
Mr. Marks's attorney.

24:35.275 --> 24:37.244
Mr. Marks doesn't talk?

24:37.244 --> 24:40.380
Well, you're making
a big mistake, Detective.

24:40.380 --> 24:41.448
We'd like to
help you fix that.

24:41.448 --> 24:43.583
Oh, yeah?
How you gonna do that?

24:43.583 --> 24:46.519
Uh, Mr. Rykoff was working
at the club Saturday night.

24:46.519 --> 24:50.623
Customers and employees
saw him there as late as
3:00 in the morning.

24:50.623 --> 24:53.060
Never left Las Vegas.

24:53.060 --> 24:55.528
Sworn affidavits
attesting to that fact.

24:56.763 --> 24:59.932
Employees and customers.
Anyone not in your pocket?

24:59.932 --> 25:01.168
This isn't a courtroom,
Mr. Marks.

25:01.168 --> 25:02.569
What do you want?

25:02.569 --> 25:05.605
I want you to
enjoy yourself,
Detective.

25:05.605 --> 25:07.074
Stay another night.

25:07.074 --> 25:09.676
Nice hotel,
nice girl.

25:09.676 --> 25:11.278
Maybe you'll get lucky
at the tables.

25:11.278 --> 25:12.845
You like Blackjack?

25:12.845 --> 25:15.482
And what do you get?

25:15.482 --> 25:17.217
A different gun.

25:17.217 --> 25:19.586
It's in there, right,
the one you found?

25:19.586 --> 25:22.889
We'll have one just like it
in your room tonight, .22.

25:22.889 --> 25:24.124
I don't take bribes.

25:24.124 --> 25:25.958
I'm not offering you
a bribe.

25:25.958 --> 25:28.128
I'm offering you
the truth.

25:28.128 --> 25:29.462
Tony was family.

25:29.462 --> 25:32.832
His father and my father
first cousins.

25:32.832 --> 25:34.901
I want whoever did this.

25:34.901 --> 25:37.770
I'm telling you
on my mother's grave
in Yerevan,

25:37.770 --> 25:40.407
it was not Rykoff.

25:40.407 --> 25:42.109
You're being manipulated,
Detective.

25:42.109 --> 25:46.313
Las Vegas Metro
has been trying to entrap
Mr. Marks for years.

25:46.313 --> 25:47.914
They're putting the screws
to Lucky

25:47.914 --> 25:49.216
to get him to
turn on me.

25:49.216 --> 25:50.683
It's what I'd do
if I were them.

25:50.683 --> 25:53.420
Think it'll work?
Think he'll flip?

25:53.420 --> 25:55.122
Lucky?

25:55.122 --> 25:57.124
I think he'll
stand up.

25:58.491 --> 26:01.194
But you can't be sure.
Can you?

26:01.928 --> 26:04.231
Bosch.

26:04.231 --> 26:06.799
You can't crash
my place of business,

26:06.799 --> 26:08.901
assault my employees,

26:08.901 --> 26:11.371
and not expect me to react.

27:02.355 --> 27:05.192
Hey.
I'm headed back to L.A.

27:05.192 --> 27:06.226
Your case?

27:06.226 --> 27:07.794
Did you get my message?

27:07.794 --> 27:08.795
Come in.

27:12.899 --> 27:14.601
Were you gonna
call me back?

27:14.601 --> 27:16.236
Not until I had
something new to say.

27:16.236 --> 27:17.837
Well, you could have
called me to tell me that.

27:17.837 --> 27:20.507
You know how
that conversation
would have started.

27:20.507 --> 27:22.275
It would have started
with "I'm sorry."

27:22.275 --> 27:23.676
Couples say that a lot.

27:23.676 --> 27:25.612
- We're not a couple.
- Okay. Ex couple.

27:25.612 --> 27:27.580
We have a child.
We're that type couple.

27:27.580 --> 27:30.550
Well, look,
I'm tired of apologizing.

27:30.550 --> 27:32.719
I'm just tired of
how we are with each other.

27:32.719 --> 27:36.122
I feel like I'm always
apologizing for something.

27:36.122 --> 27:37.657
Okay, so let's
quit apologizing.

27:37.657 --> 27:38.625
Good.

27:40.727 --> 27:45.932
Listen. I didn't
pay back Tim Kirsch.

27:45.932 --> 27:47.367
Reggie did.

27:47.367 --> 27:49.236
Before you were married
or after?

27:49.236 --> 27:51.471
Does it matter?

27:51.471 --> 27:53.105
Look, you asked me
how much I borrowed.

27:53.105 --> 27:55.375
It was 100 grand.

27:55.375 --> 27:57.810
Jesus. That's
a lot of bread, Eleanor.

27:57.810 --> 27:59.145
It's a business,
Harry.

27:59.145 --> 28:00.780
What matters in
the long run is winning,

28:00.780 --> 28:01.981
which I do.

28:01.981 --> 28:04.351
- You pay Reggie back?
- Many times over.

28:04.351 --> 28:07.019
Look, he helped me out
because he loves me.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.888
But I still feel like
I owe him.

28:08.888 --> 28:10.757
The other night was
a big game with a big client,

28:10.757 --> 28:13.260
and I shouldn't have
just blown it off.

28:13.260 --> 28:15.562
You're tired of it,
blow it all off. Quit.

28:15.562 --> 28:17.664
It's not that simple.
It's our business.

28:17.664 --> 28:19.366
Look, there's plenty
of bullshit in your job,

28:19.366 --> 28:21.468
but you don't just
walk away.

28:21.468 --> 28:22.769
Yeah, but I put up with
the bullshit

28:22.769 --> 28:24.371
because what I do
is important.

28:24.371 --> 28:26.806
Oh, God, you're such
a condescending asshole.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.641
Okay, sorry.
I didn't mean it that way.

28:28.641 --> 28:29.809
Yes, you did.

28:33.012 --> 28:35.282
Maddie around?

28:35.282 --> 28:36.783
You missed her.

28:36.783 --> 28:38.885
Tell her I'll be back
in a day or so.

28:50.830 --> 28:52.765
Word, Lieutenant?

28:52.765 --> 28:54.401
Chief. Come in.

29:03.610 --> 29:05.111
This morning
I got a phone call

29:05.111 --> 29:07.213
from District
Attorney O'Shea.

29:07.213 --> 29:09.382
Last night in Venice
at his fundraiser

29:09.382 --> 29:10.817
officers wrote
dozens of tickets

29:10.817 --> 29:13.185
for non-resident
parking violations.

29:13.185 --> 29:14.654
And why did they do that?

29:14.654 --> 29:16.856
The valet had no permit.

29:16.856 --> 29:18.591
Somebody tipped
the mayor's campaign,

29:18.591 --> 29:20.593
and Chief Tenzer called
Pacific Division personally

29:20.593 --> 29:22.462
to get those officers
over there.

29:22.462 --> 29:25.164
I don't understand
why you're telling me this.

29:25.164 --> 29:27.434
I'm asking people I can trust
throughout the department

29:27.434 --> 29:29.436
to keep their ears open.

29:29.436 --> 29:32.772
If you hear of anything
brewing in Hollywood--

29:32.772 --> 29:36.843
That's my personal cell.
Call me day or night.

29:36.843 --> 29:39.612
You know,
if you need somebody
you can trust in Pacific,

29:39.612 --> 29:40.847
Captain Macken
is a friend.

29:40.847 --> 29:41.981
Macken?

29:41.981 --> 29:44.451
That's who Tenzer called
to make it happen.

29:44.451 --> 29:45.885
She oversaw
the whole thing.

30:40.106 --> 30:41.441
Good news
and bad news.

30:41.441 --> 30:43.976
Tell the bad first.

30:43.976 --> 30:46.746
No prints, and the gun
is untraceable.

30:46.746 --> 30:48.681
Someone used acid
on the serial,

30:48.681 --> 30:51.584
and none of my magic tricks
could bring it up. Sorry.

30:51.584 --> 30:52.852
And the good?

30:52.852 --> 30:56.956
Weapon and bullet
a definite match.

30:56.956 --> 30:57.924
It's the murder weapon.

31:00.627 --> 31:01.928
Well, look who's here.

31:01.928 --> 31:03.830
He's here to help us
solve our case.

31:09.969 --> 31:11.904
I believe you've met
special agent Griffin.

31:11.904 --> 31:14.707
- How you doin'?
- Good afternoon.

31:14.707 --> 31:16.976
He's got something for us
on Luke Rykoff.

31:16.976 --> 31:17.844
Told you.

31:17.844 --> 31:19.612
How'd the ballistics
pan out?

31:19.612 --> 31:22.048
Gun found in Rykoff's house
is the murder weapon.

31:22.048 --> 31:24.083
The gun you found,
Detective. Great work.

31:24.083 --> 31:26.686
What do you know
about him, Rykoff?

31:26.686 --> 31:28.087
He's a soldier.
Expendable.

31:28.087 --> 31:29.756
He give you an alibi?

31:29.756 --> 31:32.324
Says he was working at Dolly's
when Allen was murdered.

31:32.324 --> 31:34.093
Marks had a pile of
sworn affidavits.

31:34.093 --> 31:36.929
Well, you can
wipe your ass with those,

31:36.929 --> 31:39.632
because you can prove that
Rykoff wasn't in Vegas

31:39.632 --> 31:41.367
the night that
Allen was killed.

31:41.367 --> 31:43.603
He was here.

31:43.603 --> 31:46.172
The night of the murder,
Rykoff took the 7:40 flight

31:46.172 --> 31:47.474
from McCarran to LAX.

31:47.474 --> 31:49.476
That gets him in L.A.
in plenty of time.

31:49.476 --> 31:53.480
Travel records and the gun
guarantee his extradition
to L.A.

31:53.480 --> 31:55.181
I have no doubt he'll be
indicted for murder.

31:58.685 --> 32:00.953
Detective,
you cracked your case.

32:00.953 --> 32:02.154
Congratulations.

32:02.154 --> 32:03.289
Thanks.

32:03.289 --> 32:04.757
- Lieutenant.
- Agent Griffin.

32:10.563 --> 32:12.532
Nice, neat little bow,
isn't it?

32:12.532 --> 32:13.900
Pretty color.

32:13.900 --> 32:15.802
- You're being sarcastic.
- Me? Never.

32:15.802 --> 32:18.871
Sometimes playing nice
actually works.

32:18.871 --> 32:20.206
Let the widow know
where things stand

32:20.206 --> 32:21.373
before you
head back to Vegas.

32:21.373 --> 32:22.542
Sure.

32:23.676 --> 32:25.211
Hey, Harry,
you got a minute?

32:25.211 --> 32:26.312
Yes, ma'am.

32:26.312 --> 32:27.814
I'll get this
off to the D.A.

32:27.814 --> 32:28.781
Great.

32:30.650 --> 32:32.218
Irving came to
see me today.

32:32.218 --> 32:33.385
About the fundraiser.

32:33.385 --> 32:34.887
What, you heard?

32:34.887 --> 32:38.124
Talk of the town.
I love campaign season.

32:38.124 --> 32:39.626
Do you even vote?

32:39.626 --> 32:41.961
Just to get that
little sticker.

32:41.961 --> 32:45.431
Irving wants me
to be his lookout
here in Hollywood.

32:45.431 --> 32:47.767
Yeah. Tenzer calls
Captain Gandle.

32:47.767 --> 32:49.035
What are you
supposed to do about it?

32:49.035 --> 32:50.036
My point.

32:50.036 --> 32:51.538
I'll have Tenzer
pissing in one ear,

32:51.538 --> 32:53.039
and Irving in the other.

32:53.039 --> 32:55.241
That's one of the reasons
I never wanted to make rank.

32:55.241 --> 32:57.409
I mean,
if Irving makes chief, then
that could be good for me.

32:57.409 --> 32:59.546
- On the other hand--
- You don't want to
take sides.

32:59.546 --> 33:03.249
Well, I don't want to
get my head chopped off
if it doesn't happen.

33:03.249 --> 33:05.351
Are you asking
for my advice?

33:05.351 --> 33:07.820
I guess I am.

33:08.721 --> 33:11.323
Sometimes you
pick your rabbi.

33:11.323 --> 33:15.294
Sometimes the rabbi
picks you.

33:25.738 --> 33:28.240
...what we have to do
is plug up the holes--

33:28.240 --> 33:29.642
Hang on just a second.

33:29.642 --> 33:31.477
- Irv.
- Evening, Rick.

33:31.477 --> 33:32.745
This is
Deputy Chief Irving,

33:32.745 --> 33:35.682
the finest of
L.A.'s finest.

33:35.682 --> 33:37.884
- My wife Connie.
- How are you this evening?

33:37.884 --> 33:39.786
- Rick.
- Connie.

33:39.786 --> 33:41.588
We were talking about
the justice system,

33:41.588 --> 33:43.389
- and victim's rights.
- Oh, that so?

33:43.389 --> 33:45.057
Now, Irv here has
some great ideas

33:45.057 --> 33:47.093
on how to speed up
the process,

33:47.093 --> 33:48.494
make the system
more efficient,

33:48.494 --> 33:50.096
more just.

33:50.096 --> 33:51.664
Well, my detectives
don't like waiting years

33:51.664 --> 33:53.766
for their cases to
come to trial, either.

33:53.766 --> 33:56.736
It's good to have a D.A.
who understands the issues
from our point of view.

33:56.736 --> 33:59.105
- Ah-ha.
- Ah. Our host.

33:59.105 --> 34:01.173
Jim Dawson,
I'd like you to meet
Deputy Chief Irving,

34:01.173 --> 34:02.675
- and his wife Connie.
- Pleasure.

34:02.675 --> 34:04.010
- Pleasure.
- Thank you for having us.

34:04.010 --> 34:06.012
- The house is lovely.
- Well, thank you.

34:06.012 --> 34:08.147
Thank you.
I hope you'll consider
writing a check

34:08.147 --> 34:09.849
before the evening's out.

34:09.849 --> 34:12.084
Uh, Jim, Chief Irving
is contributing

34:12.084 --> 34:13.519
to our campaign
in other ways.

34:13.519 --> 34:15.121
I'm glad to hear it.

34:15.121 --> 34:17.323
Uh, Rick,
I've got some people
I'd like you to meet.

34:17.323 --> 34:18.691
Excuse us, please.

34:21.694 --> 34:23.162
You sure you don't want
that drink?

34:23.162 --> 34:24.664
I have to drive.

34:24.664 --> 34:27.233
Well, you shouldn't have
given Wash the night off.

34:27.233 --> 34:29.869
It would have been cruel
to inflict it on him.

34:29.869 --> 34:32.471
You inflicted it on me.

34:32.471 --> 34:35.207
You have
a glass of wine.

34:35.207 --> 34:38.010
I will.

34:38.010 --> 34:38.811
Water, please.

34:38.811 --> 34:41.280
Cheers.

34:48.087 --> 34:50.256
You did well.

34:50.256 --> 34:52.358
So did you.

34:52.358 --> 34:53.693
Thanks for coming.

34:53.693 --> 34:56.395
Of course.

34:56.395 --> 34:58.865
Ah, you're kidding me.

34:58.865 --> 35:00.867
At this time of night?

35:00.867 --> 35:04.570
- Shit.
- What is it?

35:04.570 --> 35:07.774
DUI checkpoint.
Tenzer.

35:07.774 --> 35:11.110
Tenzer?
It's outrageous.

35:17.984 --> 35:20.452
Sir! You need to
get back in line!

35:20.452 --> 35:23.956
Deputy Chief Irving.
What's going on here?

35:23.956 --> 35:26.325
Uh,
a DUI checkpoint, sir.

35:26.325 --> 35:28.961
I can see that.
Who authorized it?

35:28.961 --> 35:30.562
Uh, I don't know, sir.

35:30.562 --> 35:32.198
Well,
where's your sergeant?

35:32.198 --> 35:34.400
Uh, he went down the hill
to find a bathroom, sir.

35:34.400 --> 35:35.567
He should be back shortly.

35:35.567 --> 35:38.838
- Find him for me.
- Yes, sir.

35:38.838 --> 35:41.240
- Uh, 34-TL-45.
- 45, go.

35:41.240 --> 35:46.412
Have 34-L-60
respond to intersection
Argyle and Franklin.

35:46.412 --> 35:48.848
Code 2.

35:48.848 --> 35:52.719
Chief?
- Lieutenant, is Outpost Drive
still in Hollywood division?

35:52.719 --> 35:54.053
Is there a problem, sir?

35:54.053 --> 35:56.055
How does traffic set up
a DUI checkpoint

35:56.055 --> 35:58.557
right outside an
O'Shea fundraiser
in your division,

35:58.557 --> 36:00.459
and you not hear about it?

36:00.459 --> 36:03.529
I don't know, sir.
I will look into it
right away.

36:03.529 --> 36:05.297
Do that.

36:22.148 --> 36:23.382
Hey, evening.

36:23.382 --> 36:24.917
Hey, Carl.

36:24.917 --> 36:26.085
Here to see Mrs. Allen.

36:26.085 --> 36:27.553
I'll let her know
you're here.

36:27.553 --> 36:28.855
Hey, how's it comin'?

36:28.855 --> 36:30.122
Made an arrest.

36:30.122 --> 36:31.090
No shit. Who?

36:31.090 --> 36:32.992
Some Vegas shitbird.
He's on ice.

36:32.992 --> 36:34.894
We're driving over
in the morning
to grab him up.

36:34.894 --> 36:37.764
Wow, good work.

36:37.764 --> 36:40.599
What was it?
Was it a mob thing?

36:40.599 --> 36:41.768
Why do you say that?

36:41.768 --> 36:43.135
I don't know.
Mr. Allen,

36:43.135 --> 36:45.471
the way he dressed,
the whole porn deal.

36:45.471 --> 36:48.607
There's was always
something about him
that just--

36:48.607 --> 36:50.877
He smelled like a made guy.

36:50.877 --> 36:53.813
Uh, anyway, go ahead.
Go on up.

36:53.813 --> 36:55.214
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

37:13.365 --> 37:15.301
Evening,
Mrs. Allen.

37:15.301 --> 37:16.969
And what can I do
for you, gentlemen?

37:16.969 --> 37:18.704
We wanted you to know
we've arrested a suspect

37:18.704 --> 37:19.906
in your husband's murder.

37:19.906 --> 37:21.007
His name is
Luke Rykoff.

37:21.007 --> 37:23.810
He manages a strip club
in Vegas.

37:23.810 --> 37:26.412
Strip club.
Well, that would explain
how my husband knew him.

37:26.412 --> 37:28.280
Rykoff had an altercation
with your husband

37:28.280 --> 37:29.715
the night before
he was killed.

37:29.715 --> 37:31.283
About what?

37:31.283 --> 37:34.086
Over one of the dancers,
friend of your husband's.

37:34.086 --> 37:37.356
- His girlfriend.
- Maybe.

37:37.356 --> 37:39.191
Live by the sword,
die by the sword.

37:39.191 --> 37:41.527
Isn't that
what they say?

37:41.527 --> 37:43.629
Rykoff worked for
Joey Marks.

37:43.629 --> 37:46.598
As did your husband.

37:46.598 --> 37:48.835
You know him,
Joey Marks?

37:54.006 --> 37:56.008
I know him.

37:56.008 --> 37:59.545
He and Tony
were cousins.

37:59.545 --> 38:01.914
And you don't look
surprised.

38:01.914 --> 38:04.851
You didn't think
we'd find out?

38:04.851 --> 38:06.352
Mrs. Allen,
whatever you know

38:06.352 --> 38:09.856
can help us build a case
against Rykoff and Marks.

38:09.856 --> 38:11.723
You think Joey Marks
is involved?

38:11.723 --> 38:12.992
He might be.

38:15.494 --> 38:19.331
Look, Joey scares me
for obvious reasons.

38:19.331 --> 38:21.033
That's why I didn't
mention it.

38:21.033 --> 38:22.734
Were he and
your husband close?

38:22.734 --> 38:23.970
They fought a lot.

38:23.970 --> 38:25.872
Tony thought Joey
was an asshole.

38:25.872 --> 38:27.874
Joey thought Tony
was a pussy.

38:27.874 --> 38:29.909
What about their
business relationship?

38:29.909 --> 38:32.311
Joey invested in his films.

38:32.311 --> 38:33.880
Tony bitched about him
all the time,

38:33.880 --> 38:35.214
said he was
always on his back.

38:35.214 --> 38:38.017
Had they had
a falling out recently?

38:38.017 --> 38:39.952
You know how it is
with family.

38:39.952 --> 38:41.888
I got tired of listening
to Tony's complaints,

38:41.888 --> 38:43.890
so I just blocked it out.

38:47.326 --> 38:49.695
Thank you for
letting me know.

38:49.695 --> 38:51.030
Have a good evening.

39:03.109 --> 39:04.476
Have a good night,
detectives.

39:14.987 --> 39:16.923
Yeah, they just left.

39:18.790 --> 39:21.127
I know that guy.
He's a cop.

39:21.127 --> 39:23.329
- I know him from Hollenbeck.
- Moonlighting.

39:23.329 --> 39:26.298
I've said his guys are
ex cops or on the job.

39:26.298 --> 39:28.034
Shoot me.

39:28.034 --> 39:30.236
I'm gonna stick to real estate,
thank you very much.

39:31.437 --> 39:33.072
Feel like we're
bein' played, brother.

39:34.240 --> 39:36.142
Seems a bit hinky,
don't you think?

39:36.142 --> 39:38.110
FBI so eager to help.

39:38.110 --> 39:40.012
They just want to
keep us away.

39:40.012 --> 39:41.948
Away from their
larger inquiry.

39:41.948 --> 39:44.450
Or Tony Allen
and Luke Rykoff.

39:44.450 --> 39:47.153
Two unimportant guys
the FBI doesn't care about,

39:47.153 --> 39:48.955
but they're keeping
close tabs on 'em.

39:48.955 --> 39:51.657
Speaking of tabs,
how long has that car
been behind us?

39:53.392 --> 39:55.962
I don't know.

39:55.962 --> 39:57.663
How'd Griffin know
we'd been to ballistics?

39:57.663 --> 39:59.065
Yeah, that, too.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.769
Speaking of tabs,
let's get a drink.

40:03.769 --> 40:07.306
Okay. If the Feds
follow us inside,
you're buying.

40:42.574 --> 40:45.511
