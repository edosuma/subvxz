WEBVTT

00:10.750 --> 00:12.833
[indistinct chatter]

00:17.958 --> 00:20.083
Anything to declare?

00:20.167 --> 00:23.833
I have nothing to declare,
my dear man, except my genius.

00:23.917 --> 00:28.000
[robotic voice]
And I have nothing to declare
except Rebo's genius either.

00:28.083 --> 00:29.875
[all laughing]

00:32.958 --> 00:35.000
Zooty, zoot, zoot, zoot.

00:36.667 --> 00:38.375
(Garibaldi)
Sounds like they're through
immigration already.

00:38.458 --> 00:40.500
Sir, what do you know about
Brakiri religious customs?

00:40.583 --> 00:43.708
Oh, uh, let's see,
um, not a thing.

00:43.792 --> 00:45.125
All I know is that
they hate comets.

00:45.208 --> 00:46.792
Even mentioning
of a comet to a Brakiri

00:46.875 --> 00:48.833
is some kind of, like,
awful taboo. Death.

00:48.917 --> 00:50.458
- It's the symbol of death.
- Why do you ask?

00:50.542 --> 00:52.375
Well, they want me to sell them
a piece of Babylon 5

00:52.458 --> 00:54.625
just for tonight
for, uh, religious reasons.

00:57.042 --> 00:59.292
It reminds me
of my senior ex-wife.

00:59.375 --> 01:01.417
- What is it?
- Candy.

01:01.500 --> 01:06.542
Only for carbon-based life forms
who can metabolize sugar.

01:06.625 --> 01:09.667
Otherwise,
it's decorative ornament.

01:09.750 --> 01:11.208
How much?

01:11.292 --> 01:15.292
You are
Centauri emperor-to-be.

01:15.375 --> 01:17.458
In "Universe Today."

01:17.542 --> 01:20.500
- Him?
- I am Londo Mollari.

01:20.583 --> 01:24.500
Tell me, Noble Mollari

01:24.583 --> 01:29.625
who would you meet of those
who have gone before us?

01:29.708 --> 01:31.083
Of the dead?

01:31.167 --> 01:34.833
I would meet,
um, the first emperor.

01:34.917 --> 01:38.000
I have several bones
to pick with him.

01:38.083 --> 01:40.833
- They are a gift.
- Oh, no.

01:40.917 --> 01:43.333
- I insist.
- Oh.

01:43.417 --> 01:48.000
May the comet
bring you wisdom this night.

01:48.083 --> 01:49.333
Yeah.

01:52.417 --> 01:54.292
They are in aid of what?

01:54.375 --> 01:56.875
A Brakiri harvest festival?

01:58.208 --> 02:02.333
Tonight is the Day Of The Dead.

02:02.417 --> 02:05.792
Tonight the dead return.

02:08.625 --> 02:10.167
(Kosh)
And so it begins.

02:10.250 --> 02:11.583
(male #1)
There is a hole in your mind.

02:11.667 --> 02:13.208
(Sinclair)
What do you want?

02:13.292 --> 02:14.875
(G'Kar)
No one here is exactly
what he appears.

02:14.958 --> 02:16.750
(Sinclair)
Nothing's the same anymore.

02:16.833 --> 02:18.875
(Hague)
Commander Sinclair
is being reassigned.

02:18.958 --> 02:20.792
(Londo)
Why don't you eliminate
the entire Narn homeworld?

02:20.875 --> 02:23.292
(Elric)
I see a great hand
reaching out of a star.

02:23.375 --> 02:25.417
(Sebastian)
Who are you?

02:25.500 --> 02:27.750
(female #1)
President Clark has signed
a decree today declaring..

02:27.833 --> 02:29.375
(Sheridan)
These orders have forced us
to declare independence.

02:29.458 --> 02:31.375
(Bester)
Weapons, supplies..

02:31.458 --> 02:33.333
(Sheridan)
...get off their encounter
suited butts and do something.

02:33.417 --> 02:35.042
(Zathras)
You're the one who was.

02:35.125 --> 02:37.458
(Kosh)
If you go to Z'ha'dum,
you will die.

02:37.542 --> 02:39.042
(Lorien)
Why are you here?

02:39.125 --> 02:41.125
Do you have anything
worth living for?

02:41.208 --> 02:42.708
(Delenn)
I think of my beautiful city
in flames.

02:42.792 --> 02:44.208
(Sheridan)
Giants in the playground.

02:44.292 --> 02:46.042
Now get the hell
out of our galaxy.

02:46.125 --> 02:48.375
We are here to place
President Clark under arrest.

02:48.458 --> 02:50.500
[theme music]

03:41.708 --> 03:43.500
[doorbell chimes]

03:43.583 --> 03:45.208
Yes?

03:47.625 --> 03:48.917
Lennier.

03:53.542 --> 03:55.958
What a wonderful surprise.

03:56.042 --> 03:58.417
Well, I thought
you were in deep space.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.333
I'm between training cycles.

04:00.417 --> 04:03.000
Well, look at you.
You look so good.

04:03.083 --> 04:05.333
Anla'Shok training
must agree with you.

04:05.417 --> 04:07.292
- How long will you be staying?
- Not long.

04:07.375 --> 04:08.792
It is the Brakiri
Day Of The Dead.

04:08.875 --> 04:11.000
- I could not miss it.
- I will confess.

04:11.083 --> 04:12.917
I have never heard
of this festival.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.500
Well, I read an account of it
when I was a young priest.

04:15.583 --> 04:17.250
It has always haunted me.

04:17.333 --> 04:19.917
It occurs one night
roughly every 200 years.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.375
The Brakiri contemplate and
honor those who've gone beyond

04:23.458 --> 04:25.333
but there have been some
very strange stories

04:25.417 --> 04:26.583
told of this night.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.000
I had a few days leave coming

04:28.083 --> 04:30.333
and Babylon 5 is easier
to visit than Brakir

04:30.417 --> 04:32.750
so I came to learn.

04:33.750 --> 04:35.958
Y-your partner, he's well?

04:36.042 --> 04:37.542
My husband.

04:37.625 --> 04:40.042
Yes, he's, um,
he's very well.

04:40.125 --> 04:42.667
Right now, he's,
um, he's hosting

04:42.750 --> 04:47.583
a cocktail party for,
uh, Rebo and Zooty.

04:47.667 --> 04:50.250
'Yeah. Later tonight,
we are having dinner with them.'

04:51.458 --> 04:53.708
Rebo and Zooty are here?

04:53.792 --> 04:55.250
Zoot zoot?

04:56.292 --> 04:58.208
This is truly a day of wonders.

04:58.292 --> 05:02.917
Humor is truly
a universal element.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.875
Like hydrogen.

05:04.958 --> 05:08.042
The two people who have honored
us with their visit today

05:08.125 --> 05:10.667
have brought joy to so many.

05:10.750 --> 05:14.000
Now they were born
under other names.

05:14.083 --> 05:16.958
But they are known
across the universe

05:17.042 --> 05:19.375
as Rebo and Zooty.

05:19.458 --> 05:21.417
[all cheering]

05:22.792 --> 05:23.875
Zooty, zoot, zoot.

05:25.333 --> 05:29.042
Now with all the trauma
that we have endured lately

05:29.125 --> 05:32.750
it gives me enormous pleasure
to confer upon them..

05:33.917 --> 05:36.208
...the freedom of Babylon 5.

05:36.292 --> 05:37.750
[applause]

05:37.833 --> 05:39.042
Hm.

05:39.125 --> 05:41.250
[laughs]

05:43.375 --> 05:46.750
I have written a speech,
which I will recite in English

05:46.833 --> 05:49.250
and which Zooty has translated
by himself..

05:49.333 --> 05:52.542
(all)
With the machine.

05:52.625 --> 05:55.667
...into his own
universal language.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.917
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. President

06:00.000 --> 06:03.792
alien races with ears,
alien races without ears

06:03.875 --> 06:07.167
and Zooty's friend Bingo,
the invisible fish.

06:12.417 --> 06:13.375
We..

06:13.458 --> 06:14.792
[laughs]

06:20.375 --> 06:21.875
We have..

06:27.417 --> 06:28.958
Oh, this is a moment
you can tell

06:29.042 --> 06:30.958
your children about, captain.

06:31.042 --> 06:33.167
I'll get on to having
some right away.

06:34.208 --> 06:35.667
What?

06:35.750 --> 06:38.042
I said I have an appointment
with the Brakiri ambassador.

06:38.125 --> 06:40.167
I'm on my way.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.125
- Long life to you.
- And to you, ambassador.

06:50.208 --> 06:54.042
Here. For you.
The skull is for eating.

06:54.125 --> 06:58.292
The comet is a gift from
all the Brakiri on Babylon 5.

06:58.375 --> 07:00.542
It is of great
religious significance.

07:00.625 --> 07:02.833
You must not refuse it.

07:02.917 --> 07:05.208
Well, it's very beautiful.
Thank you.

07:06.333 --> 07:08.875
I must, of course,
report the gift.

07:10.250 --> 07:12.792
I've, uh, I've taken
your request under advisement

07:12.875 --> 07:15.000
in my capacity
as captain of Babylon 5--

07:15.083 --> 07:16.833
And everything is okay.

07:16.917 --> 07:19.583
We can purchase Babylon 5
for the Brakiri.

07:19.667 --> 07:21.958
It must be ours by sunset.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.250
Well, it's certainly
an unusual request.

07:24.333 --> 07:26.167
We can normally only rent
space around here.

07:26.250 --> 07:28.500
But we must buy it.

07:29.542 --> 07:31.917
If we rent it,
it is not Brakiri.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.333
It's yours, not ours.

07:33.417 --> 07:35.542
We'll give it back.
It's yours again at sunrise.

07:35.625 --> 07:37.542
I understand that, ambassador.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.375
In this case,
I can understand

07:39.458 --> 07:42.375
that an exception
might need to be made.

07:42.458 --> 07:46.375
Just my own personal curiosity,
uh, it's the Day Of The Dead

07:46.458 --> 07:48.833
but it takes place at night?

07:48.917 --> 07:51.333
The Brakiri are night-dwelling.

07:51.417 --> 07:54.542
I see. Well, everything
seems to be in order.

07:54.625 --> 07:57.833
Captain! Ah, please
forgive this intrusion.

07:57.917 --> 08:00.083
I came as soon as I realized
what was happening.

08:00.167 --> 08:02.542
Uh, G'Kar, as you can see,
I'm rather busy, but I believe

08:02.625 --> 08:05.208
you know Ambassador Kullenbrak,
he's here to--

08:05.292 --> 08:07.167
I know.
That is why I came.

08:07.250 --> 08:09.708
I strongly advise you
against this transaction.

08:09.792 --> 08:12.750
It is dangerous
and foolish and unwise.

08:12.833 --> 08:15.417
Religious toleration is foolish?

08:15.500 --> 08:17.833
This is not a matter
of toleration.

08:17.917 --> 08:19.708
You do not know
what you are doing.

08:19.792 --> 08:22.375
The Declaration of Principles
of the Alliance.

08:23.708 --> 08:25.708
You are familiar
with it, I trust?

08:25.792 --> 08:27.125
I wrote it.

08:27.208 --> 08:30.417
It states that religious belief
shall be sacrosanct.

08:30.500 --> 08:33.625
Captain, I repeat, you do not
know what you are doing.

08:33.708 --> 08:37.083
I believe the captain knows
exactly what she is doing

08:37.167 --> 08:42.042
and I and all the Brakiri
on Babylon 5 appreciate it.

08:42.125 --> 08:44.750
I'm sorry, G'Kar. Shall we?

08:52.125 --> 08:54.417
Now you understand
that there is only one comet

08:54.500 --> 08:55.958
in the Brakiri solar system

08:56.042 --> 08:58.583
and it signals
the Day Of The Dead.

08:58.667 --> 09:00.833
The comet represents death
to all Brakiri

09:00.917 --> 09:06.083
and the line that we make here
shows us Brakiri territory.

09:06.167 --> 09:08.208
That's completely
fascinating, ambassador.

09:08.292 --> 09:10.792
Fascinating, exactly.

09:10.875 --> 09:12.958
Now I am standing
on Brakiri homeworld

09:13.042 --> 09:15.250
until planetary sunrise.

09:15.333 --> 09:17.875
Now I am standing on Babylon 5.

09:17.958 --> 09:21.917
Now I am on Brakir.
Now Babylon 5.

09:23.500 --> 09:29.208
So my quarters are on
the Brakiri side of the corridor

09:29.292 --> 09:32.917
with my bed in them
and a shower

09:33.000 --> 09:37.583
and I...hear them call me.

09:37.667 --> 09:38.875
Uh..

09:48.833 --> 09:50.250
[bell rings]

09:50.333 --> 09:53.292
[chanting in foreign language]

10:06.750 --> 10:08.250
Come in, come in.

10:09.250 --> 10:11.042
This is Delenn, my wife

10:11.125 --> 10:13.833
and the head of the advisory
board for the Alliance.

10:13.917 --> 10:16.792
Madam, we are Rebo and Zooty.

10:16.875 --> 10:20.458
N'trol ampurk'assi
lecococ ornell.

10:27.750 --> 10:29.375
W-w-w-what did you say?

10:29.458 --> 10:33.000
You see, uh, Minbari humor
is based not on physical danger

10:33.083 --> 10:36.125
or embarrassment or rejection
like human humor

10:36.208 --> 10:39.250
but rather on the failure
to obtain, uh

10:39.333 --> 10:41.125
emotional or spiritual
enlightenment.

10:41.208 --> 10:44.917
means
both a small fish..

10:45.000 --> 10:47.708
[laughs]

10:47.792 --> 10:50.917
...and-and the pleasure
you get from meeting someone

10:51.000 --> 10:53.417
for the first time.

10:53.500 --> 10:55.667
Y-you've studied Minbari humor?

10:55.750 --> 10:58.208
Yeah, Minbari humor, Narn humor,
most forms of humor.

10:58.292 --> 11:00.708
Ah, what's for dinner?
Something smells great.

11:00.792 --> 11:05.042
Uh, you know, I-I was, I was
really hoping to talk to Zooty

11:05.125 --> 11:06.542
you know, without the machine.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.750
Yeah, he, uh,
he never breaks character.

11:08.833 --> 11:10.083
Not even, not even around me.

11:10.167 --> 11:13.083
In-in ten years,
I've only heard him say one word

11:13.167 --> 11:14.375
without the machine.

11:14.458 --> 11:16.833
Oh. Oh. Wh-what's the word?

11:16.917 --> 11:19.208
- Why.
- Oh, just curious.

11:19.292 --> 11:21.500
No, no. That, that was
the word, why, uh..

11:21.583 --> 11:24.958
In ten years, I haven't
figured it out myself.

11:25.042 --> 11:28.250
- 'John?'
- Oh, coming. Yeah.

11:36.000 --> 11:41.250
(man on TV)
'And now more laughs
in the best of Rebo and Zooty.'

11:41.333 --> 11:43.583
(Zooty)
'We do what we always do, Rebo.'

11:43.667 --> 11:47.250
'We'll drive off that bridge
when we succumb to it.'

11:47.333 --> 11:48.500
(woman on TV)
'Zooty, you're my hero.'

11:48.583 --> 11:50.375
(Zooty)
'Zooty zoot.'

11:50.458 --> 11:52.625
(man on TV)
'We return to our Rebo
and Zooty movie marathon'

11:52.708 --> 11:54.917
'with "Sons of the New Desert."'

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
[donkey brays]

11:57.083 --> 12:00.292
(Zooty)
'Rebo, is that your ass
or mine?'

12:34.333 --> 12:35.583
Oh.

12:50.792 --> 12:54.083
My quarters are within
the Brakiri territory.

12:54.167 --> 12:56.375
Therefore I would like
to sleep here tonight.

12:56.458 --> 12:58.417
I-I will not be in the way.

12:58.500 --> 13:01.042
Well, uh, sure.

13:02.417 --> 13:04.708
Looks like a quiet night.

13:04.792 --> 13:06.792
Looks can be deceptive.

13:07.958 --> 13:09.958
Do not wake me.

13:16.750 --> 13:18.417
(Zooty)
'But, Rebo,
the man in the store'

13:18.500 --> 13:20.042
'said it was a special
kind of carrot'

13:20.125 --> 13:21.917
'and that was why it whistled.'

13:22.000 --> 13:24.833
(Rebo)
'Ah, Zooty, for you, 50,000
years of human civilization'

13:24.917 --> 13:26.250
'was just something
that happened'

13:26.333 --> 13:28.208
'to other people, wasn't it?'

13:35.792 --> 13:37.542
Lochley here.
What's happening?

13:38.875 --> 13:39.958
[beeps]

13:45.667 --> 13:46.792
So..

13:48.417 --> 13:52.042
...when you were emperor,
it meant something.

13:52.125 --> 13:55.708
Subduer of the Xon
and the Shoggren.

13:59.792 --> 14:01.958
Now, pfft.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.500
Anyone can be emperor.

14:04.583 --> 14:08.500
I can be emperor.
Vir can be emperor.

14:08.583 --> 14:11.500
And Vir can be emperor

14:11.583 --> 14:14.250
a small Earth cat
can be emperor.

14:19.417 --> 14:22.083
Come on. Talk to me.

14:22.167 --> 14:24.625
It is the Day Of The Dead.

14:24.708 --> 14:26.125
Hm?

14:26.208 --> 14:28.417
No? Nothing to say?

14:29.792 --> 14:33.542
Of course not.
The dead stay dead.

15:05.875 --> 15:07.833
Hello, Londo.

15:08.917 --> 15:10.625
I came back.

15:11.792 --> 15:14.292
Adira? Adira Tyree?

15:15.875 --> 15:17.167
My Adira?

15:19.292 --> 15:21.208
But you are dead.

15:21.292 --> 15:23.208
I saw your body.

15:23.292 --> 15:26.083
- You were poisoned.
- Shh.

15:29.250 --> 15:31.292
It is you.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.500
I killed the man
that killed you.

15:35.583 --> 15:37.000
Do you know that?

15:37.083 --> 15:38.500
But it didn't bring you back.

15:38.583 --> 15:40.875
I'm to be emperor.

15:40.958 --> 15:43.583
I am the savior of our people.

15:45.250 --> 15:46.542
But..

15:47.833 --> 15:49.000
I..

15:49.083 --> 15:51.500
I think that I would
give it all away..

15:53.042 --> 15:54.833
...to have you back.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.333
To have you beside me.

16:01.125 --> 16:03.500
Oh, Londo.

16:03.583 --> 16:05.000
My darling.

16:06.042 --> 16:10.042
My poor, wonderful darling.

16:15.583 --> 16:18.208
- Oh, I missed you so.
- Mm.

16:25.083 --> 16:27.125
[water running]

16:41.708 --> 16:43.875
Alright, whoever's in there,
come out with your hands up.

16:43.958 --> 16:46.417
(female #2)
'Ooh, it'd be easier if you
came in with me, Michael.'

16:46.500 --> 16:48.542
[chuckles]
'You could soap my back.'

16:50.167 --> 16:51.667
'It feels so good.'

16:51.750 --> 16:54.083
'You have no idea how much
I missed hot water.'

16:55.875 --> 16:58.042
'You got a robe, cutie?'

16:58.125 --> 16:59.375
Dodger?

17:01.083 --> 17:03.000
It can't be.

17:03.083 --> 17:05.792
'Look at you.'

17:05.875 --> 17:08.125
You got old.

17:08.208 --> 17:10.208
Tell you, I turn my back
on you for five minutes

17:10.292 --> 17:12.500
and you got old, hm?

17:13.958 --> 17:16.583
I thought you'd be
pleased to see me.

17:16.667 --> 17:19.208
But I, I thought you were dead.

17:20.375 --> 17:21.500
Ah.

17:21.583 --> 17:24.667
You know,
the reports of my death

17:24.750 --> 17:26.833
they weren't even exaggerated
a little bit.

17:28.208 --> 17:30.542
Yeah, I'm, I'm dead.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.667
But, you know, I missed you

17:34.750 --> 17:38.333
and how often do dead people
get second chances?

17:38.417 --> 17:41.583
What are you,
some kind of robot or a clone?

17:43.167 --> 17:45.500
This has got to be a Psi sting.

17:45.583 --> 17:48.792
Bester, Bester, another one of
his dirty little tricks, right?

17:48.875 --> 17:51.125
Michael, it's no one's
dirty little trick.

17:51.208 --> 17:53.292
It's, it's just me.

17:54.208 --> 17:56.417
Happy Day Of The Dead.

17:58.875 --> 18:00.625
[beeps]
Sheridan, then.

18:00.708 --> 18:02.792
[automated message]
'Sorry, that location
is out of range.'

18:02.875 --> 18:04.500
[coughing]

18:06.417 --> 18:08.542
Lizzie? Is that you?

18:10.917 --> 18:12.875
Where is this place?

18:15.250 --> 18:16.708
Zoe?

18:18.500 --> 18:20.458
Oh, my God.

18:20.542 --> 18:22.167
Zoe.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.333
Zoe, do you know
how you got here?

18:30.625 --> 18:32.333
How long has it been?

18:34.250 --> 18:35.542
Twenty years.

18:36.875 --> 18:39.333
I came back to the apartment
and I found you.

18:40.917 --> 18:44.375
You were on the floor
in the bathroom..

18:44.458 --> 18:47.250
...and you had cockroaches
all over you.

18:49.125 --> 18:50.833
You choked on your..

18:52.125 --> 18:53.625
You'd been, um..

18:55.083 --> 18:57.375
Oh, Zoe.

18:57.458 --> 18:58.708
Sorry.

19:00.292 --> 19:02.375
You said the stuff
would kill me, huh?

19:03.708 --> 19:06.000
Wanna say I told you so?
You can if you want.

19:09.292 --> 19:10.833
So then what happened?

19:10.917 --> 19:15.167
Uh, after you died,
I, uh, I got scared.

19:16.167 --> 19:17.500
I called my mom back home

19:17.583 --> 19:21.333
and ten hours later,
my dad turned up

19:21.417 --> 19:24.375
with half a dozen off-duty
marines from his platoon

19:24.458 --> 19:26.917
to, uh, take me back.

19:28.875 --> 19:30.708
You know what?

19:30.792 --> 19:34.583
Even after everything he'd done,
I was glad to see him.

19:36.417 --> 19:40.958
Then I, uh, I enlisted
in Earthforce Cadet Corps.

19:47.167 --> 19:49.042
And now I run a space station

19:49.125 --> 19:50.833
and I worry
about the daily problems

19:50.917 --> 19:54.208
of a quarter million life forms.

19:54.292 --> 19:57.750
- We're in space?
- Yeah.

19:57.833 --> 19:59.917
Cool.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.625
Um, Zoe.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.250
There was something
I've always wondered

20:04.333 --> 20:06.792
ever since you were

20:06.875 --> 20:08.167
you know..

20:12.458 --> 20:16.292
Did you do it on purpose
or was it an accident?

20:18.542 --> 20:20.125
I don't remember.

20:21.375 --> 20:23.958
Hey, have you got
any stuff around here?

20:24.042 --> 20:27.542
- We could have a little party.
- I stopped when you died.

20:27.625 --> 20:29.333
You don't party?

20:29.417 --> 20:32.750
Jeez, Lizzie,
what'd you grow up to be?

20:34.208 --> 20:36.292
We had such fun, didn't we?

20:38.083 --> 20:40.250
Didn't we have such fun?

20:40.333 --> 20:42.917
No, we were..

20:43.000 --> 20:47.708
We were cold and sick
and we were hungry all the time.

20:50.500 --> 20:53.125
We did things to survive.

20:53.208 --> 20:55.417
I've done my best to forget.

20:56.708 --> 20:59.083
We lived in that
burned-out hotel.

20:59.167 --> 21:02.917
I was scared all the time
my father was gonna find me.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.333
No, no.

21:06.208 --> 21:07.750
It was bad.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.667
Yeah, but..

21:11.750 --> 21:13.417
...we still had fun.

21:21.375 --> 21:24.000
Are you a ghost?

21:24.083 --> 21:25.625
I don't think so.

21:25.708 --> 21:28.333
I don't believe in ghosts.

21:28.417 --> 21:31.208
Anyway, I, I need to use
the rest room.

21:31.292 --> 21:34.375
Well, maybe you were transported
here in time before you died.

21:35.750 --> 21:37.000
No.

21:38.625 --> 21:39.875
I died.

21:41.125 --> 21:43.375
I do remember that
a little bit.

21:47.042 --> 21:49.292
It was bad, Lizzie.

21:54.792 --> 21:55.875
[laughs]

21:57.125 --> 21:58.042
Thank you.

21:58.125 --> 22:00.250
[beeps]
Yes?

22:00.333 --> 22:03.083
(Corwin)
'I need to talk to you
privately, Mr. President.'

22:03.167 --> 22:06.167
Uh, alright.
Uh, I won't be long.

22:06.250 --> 22:08.333
Please, enjoy the kreebish.

22:13.458 --> 22:15.083
Go ahead, lieutenant.

22:15.167 --> 22:18.125
There seems to be
a slight problem, sir.

22:18.208 --> 22:20.375
It's kind of hard to explain.

22:20.458 --> 22:23.750
We seem to be missing
a piece of the station.

22:23.833 --> 22:26.833
'We can't reach it.
We can't communicate with it.'

22:26.917 --> 22:29.875
(Sheridan)
'That piece is almost
a square mile across.'

22:29.958 --> 22:32.500
You can't just lose
something that big.

22:32.583 --> 22:35.792
'I agree,
but it's still missing.'

22:37.458 --> 22:39.583
Have you spoken
to Captain Lochley about this?

22:39.667 --> 22:42.708
Captain Lochley's quarters
are within the zone, sir.

22:47.542 --> 22:50.042
- You know something, Dodger?
- Hm?

22:50.125 --> 22:54.083
I never really believed in
anything beyond death until now.

22:54.167 --> 22:56.167
Me neither. Still don't.

22:56.250 --> 22:57.750
- You're kidding.
- No.

22:57.833 --> 22:59.125
I don't believe in ghosts

22:59.208 --> 23:01.750
or reincarnation
or any of that stuff.

23:01.833 --> 23:04.583
I figure you got one shot
at the golden ring

23:04.667 --> 23:09.167
and when you're done,
pfft, blammo, you're done.

23:09.250 --> 23:11.292
But you're, I mean..

23:11.375 --> 23:13.083
Oh, maybe it's a Psi phenomena

23:13.167 --> 23:14.958
or a time thing or technomancy.

23:15.042 --> 23:16.458
Look, I'm a marine.

23:16.542 --> 23:20.708
I trust what I can feel
or shoot or--

23:20.792 --> 23:22.917
Or, yeah.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.333
Look, weren't you meant
to bring back, you know

23:25.417 --> 23:28.375
arcane knowledge
from beyond the veil?

23:28.458 --> 23:30.750
No, all the arcane knowledge
I got

23:30.833 --> 23:32.875
I pretty much started out with.

23:32.958 --> 23:35.875
- Such as?
- Such as, um..

23:35.958 --> 23:39.333
Alright, capers, those little
things they put on pizzas

23:39.417 --> 23:42.042
pickled nasturtium buds

23:42.125 --> 23:44.792
and, um,
any Emily Dickinson poem

23:44.875 --> 23:47.583
can be sung to the tune
of "The Yellow Rose Of Texas."

23:49.333 --> 23:51.583
Come on. I won't bite you.

24:35.250 --> 24:37.750
(male #2)
'Good evening, Ranger Lennier.'

24:45.292 --> 24:47.875
- I know you.
- I should hope so.

24:47.958 --> 24:50.375
When I was alive,
I was known as Mr. Morden.

24:52.125 --> 24:54.167
It's always nice
to be recognized.

24:54.250 --> 24:56.208
You worked for the Shadows.

24:56.292 --> 24:58.458
I did a lot of things, yes.

24:58.542 --> 25:00.458
Looking back on it though,
I think I just tried

25:00.542 --> 25:02.958
to make people happy.

25:03.042 --> 25:04.292
Anyway, it's all
just history now

25:04.375 --> 25:06.542
and I've paid
for all my crimes, eh?

25:09.833 --> 25:11.667
Why did you come back here?

25:12.667 --> 25:14.083
I'm dead.

25:14.167 --> 25:15.500
It's my job.

25:16.625 --> 25:18.250
Why'd you come back here?

25:18.333 --> 25:20.000
I came for wisdom.

25:20.083 --> 25:22.458
You don't come to the dead
for wisdom, Lennier.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.667
My head was cut from my body.

25:26.750 --> 25:29.417
Even now, it rots on a pole
outside the Imperial Palace.

25:29.500 --> 25:31.292
Birds have taken the hair
for their nests.

25:31.375 --> 25:33.333
Maggots ate my flesh
and you want wisdom?

25:34.583 --> 25:36.750
Yes, I do.

25:36.833 --> 25:39.000
Wisdom.

25:39.083 --> 25:40.958
Let's see, uh..

25:41.042 --> 25:43.250
Delenn does not love you
as you love her

25:43.333 --> 25:45.375
and she never will.

25:46.208 --> 25:48.125
I know that.

25:48.208 --> 25:50.750
No, you don't,
not in your heart.

25:50.833 --> 25:52.500
That's the problem, you see?

25:53.875 --> 25:56.292
No one should ever
wanna talk to the dead.

26:00.958 --> 26:02.292
Go away.

26:02.375 --> 26:03.958
Oops, sorry,
it doesn't work like that.

26:04.042 --> 26:05.458
You raised a ghost
and now you have to listen

26:05.542 --> 26:06.958
to what he tells you.

26:07.042 --> 26:08.292
Really?

26:19.583 --> 26:21.625
[gasping]

26:28.792 --> 26:31.833
He said he didn't wanna sleep
in the Brakiri territory, sir.

26:32.833 --> 26:35.167
Well, I don't blame him.

26:35.250 --> 26:37.792
You know, Lochley said something
about selling to the Brakiri

26:37.875 --> 26:40.667
a piece of Babylon 5
right before this happened.

26:45.500 --> 26:47.625
There has to be a connection.

26:49.542 --> 26:52.000
Do you know how long
she sold them that area for?

26:52.083 --> 26:54.917
- No, sir.
- Hmm. Alright, check her log.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.375
She'll have noted
all the details.

26:56.458 --> 26:58.542
And get me
the Brakiri homeworld.

26:58.625 --> 27:00.750
Someone there must be able
to explain this.

27:00.833 --> 27:02.375
Yes, sir.

27:04.083 --> 27:05.208
[grunts]

27:05.292 --> 27:07.875
Come on. You won't
get there by walking.

27:07.958 --> 27:09.292
The other side of that corridor

27:09.375 --> 27:11.792
is over 200 million
light years away.

27:11.875 --> 27:14.542
And the air is spread a little
thinly in the middle.

27:14.625 --> 27:17.375
Think there's any coffee
in this place?

27:17.458 --> 27:20.125
Why did you help me?

27:20.208 --> 27:23.167
I know what kind
of a man you were.

27:23.250 --> 27:25.875
Give a dog a bad name
and you can hang him with it.

27:25.958 --> 27:28.667
You shouldn't listen to
everything Sheridan tells you.

27:28.750 --> 27:30.708
Actually, I'm surprised
he's not here tonight

27:30.792 --> 27:32.875
since he died at Z'ha'dum.

27:32.958 --> 27:35.083
Is there any coffee here or not?

27:36.208 --> 27:37.708
Suit yourself.

27:39.792 --> 27:41.875
So..

27:41.958 --> 27:44.875
...do you like being
a ranger, Lennier?

27:44.958 --> 27:46.708
Would you like it any better
if I were to tell you

27:46.792 --> 27:50.250
that you will betray
the Anla'Shok?

27:51.208 --> 27:53.167
You are lying.

27:53.250 --> 27:56.167
- I wish I were.
- No?

27:56.250 --> 27:59.458
Sheridan did not die
at Z'ha'dum.

27:59.542 --> 28:01.458
If you do not know the present,
how can you claim

28:01.542 --> 28:02.792
to know the future?

28:02.875 --> 28:04.417
I'm talking about the future.

28:04.500 --> 28:06.417
So what if I'm not
up on recent history?

28:06.500 --> 28:09.250
I'm prophetic, not infallible.

28:10.708 --> 28:14.625
I think you are neither,
but at least you have shown me

28:14.708 --> 28:16.792
there is truly life
beyond death.

28:16.875 --> 28:20.000
Not necessarily, but you'll find
that out soon enough.

28:22.792 --> 28:24.375
I am Anla'Shok

28:24.458 --> 28:27.583
and shall remain so
until I pass beyond.

28:27.667 --> 28:29.208
I could no more
betray the Anla'Shok

28:29.292 --> 28:31.250
than my fingers
could betray my hand.

28:32.500 --> 28:35.417
- Our talk is done.
- Your loss.

28:45.542 --> 28:47.333
Got any music around here?

28:47.417 --> 28:48.542
Yeah, there are some crystals
right there

28:48.625 --> 28:50.000
but not too loud, huh?

28:50.083 --> 28:51.875
I'm thinking here.

28:51.958 --> 28:52.833
[beeps]

28:52.917 --> 28:54.625
Lochley to C and C.

28:54.708 --> 28:57.583
[automated message]
'Sorry, that location
is out of range.'

28:57.667 --> 28:59.625
It's acting as if
the rest of Babylon 5

28:59.708 --> 29:02.292
were a million light years away.

29:02.375 --> 29:05.292
- That's not possible.
- I don't see why.

29:05.375 --> 29:08.375
Where we are is part
of the Brakiri home planet.

29:08.458 --> 29:10.667
That must be a long way
from Babylon 5.

29:10.750 --> 29:12.875
Oh, that's crazy.

29:12.958 --> 29:14.917
Wait, I wonder..

29:15.000 --> 29:16.125
On in link mode.

29:16.208 --> 29:18.000
[beeps]

29:18.083 --> 29:21.333
Locate all backup and emergency
systems currently active.

29:27.917 --> 29:29.875
Okay.

29:29.958 --> 29:33.667
Shut down units D3 through X11

29:33.750 --> 29:35.917
and reroute all power
and communications

29:36.000 --> 29:38.208
through Epsilon Grid.

29:38.292 --> 29:39.875
[automated message]
'Protected routine.'

29:39.958 --> 29:41.500
'Passcode requested.'

29:43.083 --> 29:44.292
Captain Elizabeth Lochley.

29:44.375 --> 29:46.000
Passcode, two words.

29:47.500 --> 29:48.750
Zoe's dead.

29:51.917 --> 29:53.500
Bingo.

29:57.542 --> 29:59.375
So this is the same Lise
you told me about

29:59.458 --> 30:00.792
last time I was here?

30:00.875 --> 30:02.208
Yeah.

30:02.292 --> 30:04.042
She must be quite a woman.

30:04.125 --> 30:06.208
Uh-huh, she is.

30:06.292 --> 30:08.542
Do you ever tell her about us?

30:08.625 --> 30:11.708
There was never an us
to tell her about.

30:11.792 --> 30:14.500
- I'm jealous.
- Hm.

30:14.583 --> 30:16.333
She's so lucky.

30:16.417 --> 30:20.500
She's alive and she's got you,
even though you did get old.

30:24.750 --> 30:26.792
She gets to do this.

30:30.625 --> 30:32.417
[beep]

30:32.500 --> 30:35.167
(Lochley on screen)
I hope I'm not interrupting
anything, Mr. Garibaldi.

30:35.250 --> 30:39.750
Uh, no, no. Uh, this is just,
uh, just an old friend.

30:39.833 --> 30:42.250
Dodger, this is
Captain Lochley.

30:42.333 --> 30:44.583
This is PFC, the late PFC.

30:44.667 --> 30:46.125
Durman, Elizabeth, 56927.

30:46.208 --> 30:48.708
- Killed in action, sir.
- Yeah, thank you.

30:48.792 --> 30:51.375
Mr. Garibaldi, I need
to be put through to C and C.

30:51.458 --> 30:53.042
You'll need to route
the call via Proxima

30:53.125 --> 30:55.333
using a tachyon relay.

30:55.417 --> 30:59.083
You want me to hack from Babcom
into Stellarcom

30:59.167 --> 31:01.125
and back from my quarters?

31:01.208 --> 31:03.625
Or to recommend someone else
more competent

31:03.708 --> 31:05.667
than you are currently
within Brakiri bounds.

31:05.750 --> 31:09.292
- You must be kidding.
- You have one half-hour.

31:09.375 --> 31:11.583
Now I'm going to patch
through a general broadcast

31:11.667 --> 31:14.458
explaining that we have
the situation well in hand

31:14.542 --> 31:16.750
and that there is nothing
to worry about.

31:19.667 --> 31:21.292
Captain Lochley.

31:26.500 --> 31:28.667
- Londo.
- Hm?

31:30.208 --> 31:32.375
[chuckles]

31:32.458 --> 31:34.083
Again?

31:35.417 --> 31:38.500
You make me feel so young
once more, Adira.

31:38.583 --> 31:41.125
And you make me feel alive.

31:41.208 --> 31:42.542
[beep]

31:42.625 --> 31:44.333
(Lochley on screen)
This is Captain Lochley.

31:44.417 --> 31:46.833
All of you within the marked
Brakiri boundaries

31:46.917 --> 31:50.458
'are experiencing certain
extraordinary phenomena.'

31:50.542 --> 31:52.667
What is she talking about?

31:52.750 --> 31:56.125
Idiot woman. Destroying my mood.

31:56.208 --> 31:58.792
Off. Off!

31:58.875 --> 32:00.042
[beep]

32:01.125 --> 32:02.875
But she was right.

32:03.917 --> 32:07.250
Normality will return soon

32:07.333 --> 32:10.000
and when this night is done..

32:10.083 --> 32:11.292
...so am I.

32:12.625 --> 32:13.875
And you..

32:15.042 --> 32:19.000
...you will go on
to become Emperor Mollari.

32:20.542 --> 32:22.958
I don't want to become emperor.

32:23.042 --> 32:25.417
I want to stay here with you.

32:26.542 --> 32:30.292
Londo, I'm a dream.

32:31.417 --> 32:33.500
In the morning, I'll be gone.

32:35.083 --> 32:38.167
And you will rule
40 billion Centauri..

32:40.583 --> 32:46.042
...but not one of them
will ever know you

32:46.125 --> 32:48.167
the way I know you.

32:56.458 --> 32:59.708
Now if this works,
I'll be able to convince

32:59.792 --> 33:00.958
the local information stream

33:01.042 --> 33:03.667
that it's actually
originating on Minbar..

33:05.292 --> 33:07.292
...streaming into Proxima..

33:07.375 --> 33:09.417
...and from there..

33:14.500 --> 33:16.375
[whispering]
Come on, override.

33:16.458 --> 33:17.833
You know, some guys
would be flattered

33:17.917 --> 33:20.083
if a not entirely uncute dame
returned from the dead

33:20.167 --> 33:22.875
to spend a night of lust
and passion with them.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.917
Yeah.

33:27.875 --> 33:30.250
And they'd find other ways
to prove their masculinity

33:30.333 --> 33:32.750
than hacking into
the interstellar phone system.

33:32.833 --> 33:34.208
Yes.

33:34.292 --> 33:35.375
[beeps]

33:35.458 --> 33:37.417
Captain Lochley,
your comm channels are open.

33:37.500 --> 33:40.125
Took me 17 minutes.
Goodnight.

33:40.208 --> 33:42.792
I mean, it's some guys' fantasy.

33:42.875 --> 33:45.667
A love-hungry redhead
who'll disappear in the morning

33:45.750 --> 33:47.583
never to be seen again.

33:51.167 --> 33:53.833
I'm sorry, Dodger.
What were you saying?

33:53.917 --> 33:56.208
It's a good thing I'm only here
another hour or so, cupcake.

33:56.292 --> 33:58.375
Two weeks of this,
I'd kill you.

33:59.708 --> 34:00.583
Hmph.

34:00.667 --> 34:02.583
You know, we're so impressed

34:02.667 --> 34:04.292
with how you're dealing
with this whole thing.

34:04.375 --> 34:06.875
I mean, this is a real
emergency, and, uh

34:06.958 --> 34:08.625
you're so calm and collected.

34:08.708 --> 34:11.125
We, we both admire
you both very much

34:11.208 --> 34:12.958
and that's why we've decided--

34:13.042 --> 34:15.625
(Zooty)
We want to give up
show business.

34:18.042 --> 34:20.708
Yeah, uh, we wanna
give it all up

34:20.792 --> 34:23.000
and, uh, and do
something worthwhile.

34:23.083 --> 34:24.333
Worthwhile?

34:24.417 --> 34:26.833
That's right,
like, you know, what you do.

34:27.958 --> 34:30.458
I'm sorry for running
out on you.

34:30.542 --> 34:33.083
Well, I have done everything
I can down there.

34:33.167 --> 34:35.958
Uh, John, Rebo and Zooty
are telling me

34:36.042 --> 34:39.583
they plan to give up comedy
for politics.

34:39.667 --> 34:41.958
You know, making people
laugh is, is okay.

34:42.042 --> 34:44.542
I mean, I, I enjoy
getting a laugh

34:44.625 --> 34:46.792
but, uh, I don't know.

34:46.875 --> 34:49.458
We wanna do something
more important.

34:49.542 --> 34:51.375
But you two have a real gift.

34:51.458 --> 34:55.250
I mean, when things were bad
under President Clark..

34:55.333 --> 34:57.208
...you two said things
on your show

34:57.292 --> 35:00.292
that no one else
would dare to say.

35:00.375 --> 35:03.333
But no one takes
comedians seriously.

35:03.417 --> 35:05.750
- Isn't that a contradiction?
- No.

35:05.833 --> 35:08.250
We say serious things
in a funny way

35:08.333 --> 35:10.417
but when the joke comes,
people stop listening.

35:10.500 --> 35:12.625
Uh, the real comedy all
happens in the senate.

35:12.708 --> 35:15.750
They do, they do one idiotic
thing after another

35:15.833 --> 35:19.833
but people listen
because they say it seriously.

35:19.917 --> 35:21.792
I don't know whether
we're leaving comedy

35:21.875 --> 35:24.292
to go into clown school,
but all I do know

35:24.375 --> 35:26.958
is that, uh,
comedians don't matter.

35:27.042 --> 35:29.625
Well, if you don't matter,
nothing matters.

35:29.708 --> 35:31.583
I mean, the only reason
politics exist

35:31.667 --> 35:35.125
is to ensure that people
have the freedom to laugh.

35:35.208 --> 35:36.542
And to love.

35:37.292 --> 35:39.125
And to love.

35:40.792 --> 35:41.833
[beeps]

35:43.458 --> 35:44.417
Yes?

35:44.500 --> 35:45.833
(Corwin)
'Sir, there's a call'

35:45.917 --> 35:47.625
'coming in for you
on external relay.'

35:47.708 --> 35:50.167
- 'It's Captain Lochley.'
- Patch her through.

35:52.583 --> 35:55.458
- Captain Lochley.
- Yes, Mr. President.

35:55.542 --> 35:56.750
Captain.

35:58.125 --> 36:00.833
- Where are you calling from?
- My quarters, sir.

36:00.917 --> 36:03.708
Mr. Garibaldi patched
into Stellarcom.

36:03.792 --> 36:06.583
Right now, I'm talking to you
from two levels up

36:06.667 --> 36:10.125
and 27 light years away.

36:10.208 --> 36:13.042
Don't ask.
I don't understand it either.

36:13.125 --> 36:15.750
- Are you alright?
- Yes, sir.

36:15.833 --> 36:17.583
Thank you for asking.

36:17.667 --> 36:19.750
I'm pretty sure this situation
will sort itself out

36:19.833 --> 36:24.000
at planetary sunrise when the
area ceases to be Brakiri space.

36:24.083 --> 36:25.417
Well, that's what
the authorities

36:25.500 --> 36:27.417
on the Brakiri homeworld
assured me.

36:27.500 --> 36:28.917
Sir, you're breaking up.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.375
(Sheridan)
'Uh, well, um,
later on this morning'

36:31.458 --> 36:33.250
you'll have to tell me
all about it.

36:33.333 --> 36:36.000
0800 hours in my office.

36:36.083 --> 36:37.250
Goodnight, captain.

36:37.333 --> 36:38.542
[beep]

36:50.042 --> 36:52.667
Well, time's nearly up.

36:54.292 --> 36:56.875
When you remember me, Lennier

36:56.958 --> 36:59.958
think of me as a brief
electromagnetic anamoly

37:00.042 --> 37:02.500
who told you some true things
for your own good.

37:08.208 --> 37:11.042
No, it-it is true.

37:48.833 --> 37:50.083
Maybe..

37:52.292 --> 37:54.583
Maybe one day
we'll meet up in heaven.

37:57.250 --> 38:00.167
Parting is all
we know of heaven

38:00.250 --> 38:02.292
and all we need of hell.

38:20.292 --> 38:22.542
[humming]

38:28.917 --> 38:30.875
And that's the message
I was given.

38:32.167 --> 38:34.083
So who is this Sheridan guy?

38:35.958 --> 38:37.042
It doesn't matter.

38:38.625 --> 38:40.708
So did you get married?

38:41.792 --> 38:43.583
Married.

38:43.667 --> 38:46.667
Um, actually,
to that Sheridan guy.

38:48.125 --> 38:49.875
Didn't work.

38:49.958 --> 38:52.208
Did you have any kids?

38:52.292 --> 38:53.708
No kids.

38:55.917 --> 39:00.167
I wanted to have kids,
a lot of kids.

39:03.167 --> 39:06.250
Lizzie, I do remember my death.

39:07.583 --> 39:09.542
I didn't wanna hurt you, but..

39:10.583 --> 39:13.958
Yeah, I did do it on purpose.

39:17.542 --> 39:19.667
I just couldn't go on.

39:20.750 --> 39:22.833
Don't hate me.

39:25.292 --> 39:27.583
I could never hate you.

39:46.333 --> 39:48.458
(Sheridan)
'Captain, what do you think
happened last night?'

39:48.542 --> 39:50.542
'Did you have any of these
ghostly encounters?'

39:50.625 --> 39:51.875
Yes, sir.

39:51.958 --> 39:54.333
Would you like to tell me
about it?

39:54.417 --> 39:56.917
With all due respect,
sir, it was..

39:57.000 --> 39:59.625
...intensely personal.

39:59.708 --> 40:01.917
Well, that is pretty much
what everyone tells me.

40:03.417 --> 40:05.708
Okay, captain, let me
get this straight.

40:07.375 --> 40:11.667
You sold Babylon 5
to an alien race for the night

40:11.750 --> 40:14.542
who somehow transported
a square mile

40:14.625 --> 40:16.792
of this station
to their homeworld

40:16.875 --> 40:18.625
while apparently filling it
with people

40:18.708 --> 40:21.042
temporarily returned
from the dead?

40:21.125 --> 40:22.458
Yes, sir.

40:22.542 --> 40:25.083
Well, do you have an explanation
as to why you did this?

40:25.167 --> 40:27.292
Yes, sir, I thought
it was a metaphor, sir.

40:28.750 --> 40:31.750
I-I'll try to be more
literal-minded from now on, sir.

40:31.833 --> 40:33.500
Mm.

40:33.583 --> 40:36.667
A-any idea yet
what actually happened?

40:36.750 --> 40:39.208
Well, the, uh,
the high IQ boys back home

40:39.292 --> 40:41.750
think it might have been a
device smuggled onto the station

40:41.833 --> 40:44.500
that somehow activates the parts
of the brain

40:44.583 --> 40:45.875
responsible for memory.

40:45.958 --> 40:47.500
And Zach is checking
the air ducts

40:47.583 --> 40:51.292
to see if it was a gas used
to create a similar effect.

40:51.375 --> 40:54.042
And Mr. Garibaldi wants
to blame the telepaths.

40:54.125 --> 40:56.292
Of course, these days
he's looking for grounds

40:56.375 --> 40:59.167
to blame them for everything
from sunspots to hair loss.

40:59.250 --> 41:01.708
So you have no idea
what caused it.

41:01.792 --> 41:04.292
- No, sir.
- It's a mystery.

41:04.375 --> 41:05.667
Yes, sir.

41:05.750 --> 41:08.875
But frankly, sir,
as long as no one got hurt

41:08.958 --> 41:11.250
and the effect seems
to have been temporary

41:11.333 --> 41:13.458
I, I don't have
a problem with that.

41:15.250 --> 41:18.000
I think we need a little mystery
once in a while.

41:19.625 --> 41:21.500
Oh, and, uh,
speaking of mysteries

41:21.583 --> 41:24.875
I have a message for you.
It's from someone named Kosh.

41:28.458 --> 41:30.167
What's the message?

41:30.250 --> 41:32.500
"When the long night comes

41:32.583 --> 41:35.208
return to the end
of the beginning."

41:43.167 --> 41:46.125
Oh, uh, thank you, captain.
That-that'll be all.

41:52.542 --> 41:53.625
Captain Lochley.

41:53.708 --> 41:56.417
Go ahead, say it, G'Kar,
I told you so.

41:56.500 --> 41:58.375
You warned me, I didn't listen.

41:58.458 --> 41:59.917
You were right.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.708
No, y-you were right
and I was wrong.

42:02.792 --> 42:05.750
The people who were within
the Brakiri bounds last night

42:05.833 --> 42:09.708
they seem deeper,
more at peace.

42:09.792 --> 42:11.125
I wonder what I would have seen

42:11.208 --> 42:13.583
if I had slept
in my own quarters last night.

42:14.625 --> 42:15.917
Well, I hadn't thought that--

42:16.000 --> 42:17.625
There's no profit
in might-have-beens.

42:17.708 --> 42:19.083
So we learn
from our mistakes.

42:19.167 --> 42:21.083
[laughs]
You're so funny.

42:21.167 --> 42:23.917
From now on,
I will always watch you.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.833
Zoot, zoot.

42:27.583 --> 42:29.042
Very funny.

42:29.125 --> 42:32.542
I thought perhaps you could
perform at my inauguration.

42:32.625 --> 42:35.250
However, to make
a Centauri laugh

42:35.333 --> 42:37.708
I have to give you
a piece of advice.

42:39.625 --> 42:41.875
Sometimes we learn.

42:41.958 --> 42:44.375
Let me buy you
breakfast, captain.

42:58.208 --> 43:00.167
[indistinct whispering]

43:10.792 --> 43:12.917
What did he say?

43:13.958 --> 43:16.667
Because it tells me to.

43:31.875 --> 43:32.958
[theme music]

44:03.542 --> 44:04.625
[theme music]
