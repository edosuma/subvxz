WEBVTT

00:02.603 --> 00:04.605
*

00:08.409 --> 00:10.678
D'oh!

00:10.711 --> 00:12.113
(grunts)

00:14.948 --> 00:16.517
Hmm? D'oh!

00:23.124 --> 00:26.026
-Here's your nuggets.
-Chicken nuggets?

00:26.060 --> 00:27.828
Yes.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.498
Including things that ate
or were eaten by a chicken.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.901
Mmm, chicken nuggets.

00:36.137 --> 00:37.271
* Chicken nugget

00:37.305 --> 00:40.408
* I like to eat you
while I drive *

00:40.441 --> 00:43.077
* 'Cause you guys
and french fries *

00:43.111 --> 00:45.246
* Are the perfect breakfast

00:45.279 --> 00:47.781
-* She's living in L.A.
-(shouts)

00:47.815 --> 00:51.051
* With my best
old ex-friend Ray *

00:51.085 --> 00:54.288
* Isn't that the way
the nugget taste *

00:54.322 --> 00:56.524
* Well, let's forget all that

00:56.557 --> 01:00.261
-* And give me some coleslaw
if you can find it *
-Idiot!

01:00.294 --> 01:02.196
* You've been so much more
than kind *

01:02.230 --> 01:04.365
* You can keep the dime.

01:04.398 --> 01:05.999
(crying)

01:08.402 --> 01:09.703
(chokes)

01:09.737 --> 01:11.772
Hi, Don.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.341
(grunting)

01:15.008 --> 01:17.010
(sighs)

01:18.146 --> 01:20.114
D'oh!

01:20.148 --> 01:22.283
Any Joe Billionaire
can have a Fabergé egg.

01:22.316 --> 01:24.952
I have the only Fabergé chicken.

01:24.985 --> 01:26.954
(Homer screaming in distance)

01:26.987 --> 01:29.357
(screaming grows louder)

01:30.424 --> 01:32.092
-You're fired.
-Hmm?

01:32.126 --> 01:34.562
Okay, fine. You know what?

01:34.595 --> 01:36.597
This is just the kick
in the pants I need

01:36.630 --> 01:38.065
to turn my life around.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.767
If you're gonna turn
that body around,

01:39.800 --> 01:41.302
I suggest you do it in shifts.

01:41.335 --> 01:43.504
(laughs)

01:43.537 --> 01:45.806
Oh, and, uh, Mr. Burns?

01:45.839 --> 01:51.479
You are a crazy, wrinkly,
short piece of garbage.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.914
I thought I was tall.

01:53.947 --> 01:57.785
I'm really,
really getting tired of this.

01:57.818 --> 02:00.120
The losing the jobs.
The going to Moe's.

02:00.154 --> 02:02.623
The Halloween bucket by the bed.

02:02.656 --> 02:05.459
And the licking
of the deodorant sticks.

02:05.493 --> 02:07.595
They're not Popsicles.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.129
Mint is mint.

02:09.163 --> 02:11.632
Also, we have to start
these lists earlier.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.167
It's almost midnight.

02:13.201 --> 02:15.303
Marge, look,
I'm really, really trying.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.104
I've applied
to every place in town,

02:17.137 --> 02:18.839
even Lisa's lemonade stand.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.474
You drank half the lemonade.

02:20.508 --> 02:23.844
I can't endorse a product
unless I use the product.

02:23.877 --> 02:27.448
The proceeds were going to the
National Endowment for the Arts.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.617
It was 80% of their funding.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.052
(sighs, grumbles)

02:32.085 --> 02:34.555
You need to find another job.

02:34.588 --> 02:38.226
But I found a new passion:
watching Korean soap operas.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.160
Look, see there?
Soon-Jip is in love

02:40.194 --> 02:43.397
with the one boy her father
has forbidden her to see:

02:43.431 --> 02:46.267
pop star Johnny Pop.

02:47.268 --> 02:49.002
(groans):
Oh...

02:49.036 --> 02:51.472
-Out of a job? You're in luck.
-(gasps)

02:51.505 --> 02:55.175
The high-tech start-up company
CarGo is moving to Springfield.

02:55.209 --> 02:56.877
I'm proud to announce
that we beat out

02:56.910 --> 02:58.312
50 other hopeless cities.

02:58.346 --> 03:00.248
Eat our rust, Toledo.

03:00.281 --> 03:03.183
What does the city gain
from this deal?

03:03.217 --> 03:06.487
Jobs, eight to 12 jobs.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.189
Okay, Marge, you see that?

03:09.223 --> 03:12.025
It's a sign.
I'm gonna get one of those jobs.

03:12.059 --> 03:14.094
-(chuckles): Yes, you will...
-(gasps)

03:14.127 --> 03:15.429
...says our self-help guru

03:15.463 --> 03:17.865
in our next segment
on positive thinking.

03:17.898 --> 03:21.134
Oh, TV never talks to just me.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.738
Homer, CarGo is on the forefront

03:24.772 --> 03:26.774
of autonomous vehicle
technology.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.776
We're looking
for highly passive humans

03:28.809 --> 03:31.812
to road test
our self-driving cars.

03:33.281 --> 03:35.015
Perfect answer.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.551
Yes, you could not be
more passive, could you?

03:37.585 --> 03:40.120
And your bad driving record
is a big, big plus.

03:40.153 --> 03:43.023
You've apparently never used
your blinkers.

03:43.056 --> 03:46.460
What direction I want to go is
my business and no one else's.

03:46.494 --> 03:48.529
USA! USA!

03:48.562 --> 03:52.099
And somehow you've driven
over yourself. Amazing.

03:52.132 --> 03:55.102
Is there anything we don't know
about you that we should?

03:55.135 --> 03:58.105
Well, I'd like you to know
sometimes my road rage

03:58.138 --> 04:01.742
is actually home rage
that I bring onto the highway.

04:01.775 --> 04:04.912
Now let's take a look
at your license.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.248
Who exactly are they warning?

04:08.282 --> 04:11.819
My sisters-in-law work
at the DMV.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.253
-Mm. Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

04:13.287 --> 04:15.956
Congratulations, everyone.
You're our finalists.

04:15.989 --> 04:18.759
We just have one last test
for all of you.

04:18.792 --> 04:21.128
Who's capable of sitting
for hours at a time,

04:21.161 --> 04:23.263
doing absolutely nothing?

04:23.297 --> 04:26.166
Finally, a job interview
question I can answer.

04:38.011 --> 04:39.146
(goat bleats)

04:43.351 --> 04:45.252
-You're hired.
-You're hired.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.254
Five more minutes.

04:47.287 --> 04:51.091
Wow, there's no steering wheel.
How do I steer?

04:51.124 --> 04:53.827
No, it's a self-driving car.

04:53.861 --> 04:55.996
Oh, I've never driven
one of those before.

04:56.029 --> 04:58.966
You don't have to.
The car drives itself.

04:58.999 --> 05:02.102
Awesome, awesome.
So is it, like, a joystick

05:02.135 --> 05:05.038
or, like, a turning wheel
for steering?

05:05.072 --> 05:07.107
You just tell it where to go.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.142
Oh, I speak
into the steering wheel.

05:09.176 --> 05:11.144
Antoine, check this out.

05:11.178 --> 05:13.146
The car is driving by itself.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.115
-I'm a genius.
-Now you're free

05:15.148 --> 05:17.951
-to do whatever you like, Homer.
-Can I text while it's driving?

05:17.985 --> 05:20.020
You can write a novel
while you're driving.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.455
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:21.489 --> 05:23.657
In today's
publishing environment?

05:23.691 --> 05:25.959
-Hmm.
-Will you look at that?

05:25.993 --> 05:27.661
The car is driving Homer.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.530
Oh, as far as I'm concerned,

05:29.563 --> 05:33.300
I would never forfeit my control
of the wheel. (burps)

05:33.333 --> 05:36.036
Whoa, Homer's making a smoothie
while he drives.

05:36.069 --> 05:37.638
I want to make smoothies
when I drive.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.072
You don't like smoothies.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.274
I want to make them.
I don't want to drink them.

05:45.913 --> 05:47.014
* No operator

05:47.047 --> 05:50.150
* The car just drives itself

05:50.183 --> 05:54.755
* Its computer brain knows
where the roads are *

05:54.788 --> 05:56.524
* Living in L.A.

05:56.557 --> 05:59.693
* With my best
old ex-friend Ray *

05:59.727 --> 06:01.762
(Homer crying)

06:01.795 --> 06:05.599
* Isn't that the way
that this car goes *

06:05.633 --> 06:08.001
* You don't do a thing

06:08.035 --> 06:11.939
* And where is the seat belt,
'cause I can't find it. *

06:15.876 --> 06:19.012
Eight hours pay
for riding in a car?

06:19.046 --> 06:21.549
Good-bye, rat race.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.050
Got to go, guys.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.853
Marge is here
in her yesterday-mobile.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.287
-Ready, sweetie?
-Almost.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.189
They're just finishing up
my banh mi.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.391
That's what tech people
call sandwiches.

06:31.425 --> 06:32.926
Here you go, sir.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.429
(laughs):
He forgot to charge me.

06:35.463 --> 06:38.365
Oh, no, sir, it's free.
All the food here is free.

06:38.398 --> 06:41.635
Free food? At work?
Are you serious?

06:41.669 --> 06:42.870
I sure am.

06:42.903 --> 06:46.006
(crying):
Marge, I need a moment.

06:46.974 --> 06:49.743
("Pure Imagination" playing)

06:59.853 --> 07:01.589
(laughing)

07:01.622 --> 07:03.056
One for me. One for the tray.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.425
Oh, Marge would love this.
(laughs)

07:05.459 --> 07:08.996
Something for the kids.
(laughs)

07:09.029 --> 07:12.132
-Ooh.
-(sizzling)

07:12.165 --> 07:15.302
Take the day off.

07:15.335 --> 07:18.839
Homie, when you lost your job,
I was so worried.

07:18.872 --> 07:22.009
But this is the nicest place
to work I've ever seen.

07:22.042 --> 07:25.513
-Come on, let me show you
around the campus.
-Hmm.

07:25.546 --> 07:28.616
There's the gym,
which has never been used.

07:28.649 --> 07:31.184
Indoor Ferris wheel,
never Ferrised.

07:31.218 --> 07:33.286
Then there's
the rock climbing wall,

07:33.320 --> 07:34.722
still in the wrapper.

07:36.323 --> 07:38.492
How come no one uses
these things?

07:38.526 --> 07:40.594
All these coders
never stop working.

07:40.628 --> 07:42.996
Oh, we should help them
enjoy themselves.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.998
-Hey, nerd.
-Yes?
-Yes.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.133
-Yes.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.300
-Yeah?
-Yes.
-Yes.

07:47.334 --> 07:49.102
-Yes.
-Yes.
-Huh, yes?

07:49.136 --> 07:50.170
No, I just meant...

07:50.203 --> 07:52.606
Okay, fine, all of you.
Come down here.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.107
-I'll log off.
-Log off.
-Log off.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.609
-Log off.
-Log off.
-Log off.

07:55.643 --> 07:57.377
-Log off.
-Log off.
-Log... off.

07:57.410 --> 07:59.179
-Log off.
-Log off.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.048
Come on, Team Blue.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.016
Go, Team Bald.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.587
(all cheering)

08:08.556 --> 08:10.658
Look at Homer
and his surprisingly slim wife

08:10.691 --> 08:12.159
leading that team building
exercise.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.895
Let's check
the real-time brain imaging.

08:14.928 --> 08:17.565
(gasps) Their creative centers
have gone indigo.

08:17.598 --> 08:20.167
-Is that good?
-It ain't scarlet.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.902
Homer and Marge,
what you two did

08:21.935 --> 08:24.471
to inspire our workers
was paradigm blasting.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.307
I'm sorry.
We'll replace the paradigm.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.342
No, no. It's good.

08:29.376 --> 08:32.379
We want to be number one
in employee satisfaction.

08:32.412 --> 08:35.082
-And money.
-We have the competition
by the nuts.

08:35.115 --> 08:38.151
We bought the last affordable
housing in San Francisco.

08:38.185 --> 08:41.188
And Alcatraz has gone condo.

08:41.221 --> 08:44.524
Homer, we're offering you
a promotion

08:44.558 --> 08:46.526
and making Marge your partner.

08:46.560 --> 08:47.928
-Oh.
-(chuckles)

08:47.961 --> 08:51.098
We need people like you
to help our workers relax.

08:51.131 --> 08:55.335
Have fun and forget
they may want or have families.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.937
So, what do you say? Are you in?

08:56.970 --> 08:58.939
Homie, for the first time
in our marriage,

08:58.972 --> 09:01.374
we can work together as a team.

09:01.408 --> 09:04.945
Yeah, well, I'll have to check
with my wife.

09:04.978 --> 09:07.047
-I'd love to.
-She said yes!

09:12.786 --> 09:15.088
Uh, yes, I'll have
one of those coffees

09:15.122 --> 09:17.024
that's actually a milkshake,
please.

09:17.057 --> 09:20.460
Okay, so, what kind of cow
would you like your milk from?

09:20.493 --> 09:23.063
Barnyard basic,
collegiate mascot,

09:23.096 --> 09:24.965
Minnesota full-fat...?

09:24.998 --> 09:28.135
At the cereal bar, you can
request nothing but prizes.

09:28.168 --> 09:30.403
The only thing I don't like

09:30.437 --> 09:33.073
is how I don't understand
what everyone is saying.

09:33.106 --> 09:35.308
Uh, yeah,
is that the, uh, new X4P1?

09:35.342 --> 09:38.045
Yeah, but 18-core doesn't
play nice with the motherboard

09:38.078 --> 09:39.312
unless you overclock.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.081
So, Lisa, what does that mean?

09:41.114 --> 09:43.050
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

09:43.083 --> 09:45.418
-No.
-(singsongy):
You're as stupid as I am.

09:45.452 --> 09:47.587
You're as stupid as I am.

09:47.621 --> 09:48.989
Mom!

09:49.022 --> 09:50.758
(chuckles):
Kids, kids,

09:50.791 --> 09:54.161
you're both stupid
in your own special ways.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.396
Bart's much stupider than I am.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.767
Oh, good girl.
Let your brother win.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.769
Good morning, everybody.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.971
I made lemon squares.

10:04.004 --> 10:06.239
Some, if not most,
appear to be rhombuses.

10:06.273 --> 10:09.176
-Rhombi.
-Both are acceptable.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.845
That was so fun.
Thank-thank you, Marge.

10:11.879 --> 10:13.446
What? You didn't even eat them.

10:13.480 --> 10:16.349
Well, you'll really be thrilled
with what we just found.

10:16.383 --> 10:20.120
There's a regulation hockey rink
on campus.

10:20.153 --> 10:24.091
-Oh. Whoa. Whoa.
-Ah!
-Ah!

10:24.124 --> 10:27.060
It's amazing how not
a single one of them can skate.

10:28.161 --> 10:31.331
Ow! Physical activity
makes me so sad.

10:31.364 --> 10:35.168
Oh, no. Doug's in the worst
position of all: fetal.

10:35.202 --> 10:37.004
I know what'll cheer us all up.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.271
The Christmas song
that was written

10:38.305 --> 10:40.273
by an A.I. program.

10:40.307 --> 10:43.977
ROBOTIC VOICE:
* I swear, it is Christmas Eve

10:44.011 --> 10:47.981
* I hope that is what you say

10:48.015 --> 10:49.482
*

10:49.516 --> 10:53.186
* The best Christmas present
in the world *

10:53.220 --> 10:54.788
* Is a blessing...

10:54.822 --> 10:56.023
Okay, stop. Stop, stop, stop.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.791
I have a better idea.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.993
(all laughing)

11:00.027 --> 11:03.731
Guys, you'll never guess where
I'm calling you from: work.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.833
That's work?
What are we doing here?

11:05.866 --> 11:07.334
Let's check it out.
I got a feeling

11:07.367 --> 11:10.738
there's greener pastures
just outside this door.

11:13.206 --> 11:15.042
(howling)

11:15.075 --> 11:18.178
Huh, that used to be
a Baskin-Robbins.

11:18.211 --> 11:21.014
*

11:21.048 --> 11:22.750
Oh, my God.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.551
I'm actually happy at work.

11:24.584 --> 11:28.555
I haven't looked at my watch
in seven minutes and 23 seconds.

11:28.588 --> 11:31.491
And I'm optimistic about
our future.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.426
You say that like it's
the first time.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.763
Well, there was that time
I had the first number right

11:35.796 --> 11:37.264
on the Powerball.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.432
That was a great day.

11:39.466 --> 11:42.002
Remember? 27.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.037
Mm, 27.

11:44.071 --> 11:46.406
I chose it because that's how
much money we had in the bank,

11:46.439 --> 11:50.043
-27 cents.
-Aw.

11:50.077 --> 11:52.045
Mm. Hmm?

11:52.079 --> 11:55.082
Hmm. Mmm. Mm.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.686
Smithers, what happened
to our workers?

11:59.719 --> 12:02.122
Well, apparently, this new
self-driving car company

12:02.155 --> 12:03.791
is poaching our employees.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.626
They do have an excellent
LGBT policy.

12:06.659 --> 12:08.128
What's that stand for?

12:08.161 --> 12:10.630
Lazy goof-off buffoons?
And transgender.

12:10.663 --> 12:12.365
All right, Smithers,
what's say you and I

12:12.399 --> 12:14.034
go undercover and check out
this company.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.137
You're fluent in SQL,
Python and JavaScript.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.372
Three years in
Google's A.I. division.

12:19.406 --> 12:23.376
Wow. These are very impressive
résumés for 22-year-olds.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.112
We're in.

12:25.145 --> 12:27.915
Tugs-of-war? Iced cream?

12:27.948 --> 12:30.150
(laughs)
I could never offer this.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.618
You could if you just deferred

12:31.651 --> 12:33.286
one-half percent
of your compensation.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.288
I could never offer this.

12:35.322 --> 12:36.756
(sniffs)

12:36.790 --> 12:39.159
(sniffing)

12:39.192 --> 12:41.761
Smithers, do you realize
how brilliant this is?

12:41.795 --> 12:43.130
Instead of paying them more,

12:43.163 --> 12:44.764
they make the workplace
pleasant,

12:44.798 --> 12:47.801
so the employees never want
to leave.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.837
I can never beat this.

12:51.638 --> 12:53.340
-Sorry.
-It happens.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.644
Let's go home, please.

12:57.677 --> 12:59.012
Okay, here's what
I've been thinking.

12:59.046 --> 13:01.281
A special day
where everyone dresses

13:01.314 --> 13:03.250
like their favorite superheroes.

13:03.283 --> 13:06.319
Oh, yeah.
We can make hero sandwiches.

13:06.353 --> 13:09.990
You know what I love about
working with you? Everything.

13:10.023 --> 13:12.092
(tires screech)

13:12.125 --> 13:14.094
Wait a minute, this isn't home.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.662
That's so weird.

13:15.695 --> 13:17.931
You just mentioned
hero sandwiches.

13:17.965 --> 13:20.167
It's almost like the car
was listening to us.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.302
Yeah. Let's test this out.

13:22.335 --> 13:25.505
Say, Marge, I could go
for some doughnuts.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.274
-(tires screech)
-Hmm.

13:27.307 --> 13:30.077
I'm so hungry
I could eat a horse.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.146
-Mm.
-Holy crap.

13:35.048 --> 13:39.052
This company is up to some kind
of monkey business.

13:39.086 --> 13:41.989
There's a problem
with the driverless car.

13:42.022 --> 13:44.858
(monkeys chittering)

13:44.892 --> 13:47.294
Oh, there's no problem; it's our
sponsored rides program.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.662
The cars passively combine
your conversations,

13:49.696 --> 13:51.664
facial expressions and data
we stole from Equifax

13:51.698 --> 13:53.400
to determine which of our
corporate sponsors

13:53.433 --> 13:54.834
to take you to.

13:54.868 --> 13:56.569
Corporate sponsors?
What the...?

13:56.603 --> 13:59.072
Don't you make enough money
giving out cars for free?

13:59.106 --> 14:02.175
Do you think dating sites want
you to meet other people?

14:02.209 --> 14:04.377
They want your data.

14:04.411 --> 14:06.346
That's what all websites want.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.916
Not DataGrab.net.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.050
-Yep.
-(gasps)

14:10.083 --> 14:11.919
And you can't stop us.

14:11.952 --> 14:14.321
When you joined, you signed
nondisclosure agreements,

14:14.354 --> 14:16.123
which nobody ever reads.

14:18.125 --> 14:20.060
You don't want to mess with us.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.995
We have lawyers that were
crossbred with wolves.

14:22.029 --> 14:24.097
Well, you prepare
to hear from a guy

14:24.131 --> 14:26.900
pretending to be my lawyer,
probably Moe.

14:26.934 --> 14:30.270
Now I'm gonna defiantly exit
on this moving walkway.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.539
Good day.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.445
I should have gotten off.

14:43.150 --> 14:44.918
So, my client, uh,
Homer Simpson, is suing youse.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.453
I am not a pretend attorney,

14:46.486 --> 14:50.123
I am Homer's liar-- lawyer.
Good-bye.

14:55.162 --> 14:59.132
That wasn't the kind of coke
I was talking about.

15:01.468 --> 15:04.037
Ugh...

15:04.071 --> 15:06.906
Seymour, you're driving
too fast.

15:06.940 --> 15:09.409
Mother, it's a self-driving car.

15:09.442 --> 15:11.111
Keep your eyes on the road!

15:11.144 --> 15:13.213
Aw, what am I gonna
do with you?

15:13.246 --> 15:14.581
(tires squeal)

15:14.614 --> 15:16.583
Look, they take our insurance.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.319
Marge, I can't believe
they invaded

15:19.352 --> 15:21.254
the sanctity of my car.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.423
I mean, what's next? Alexa?

15:23.456 --> 15:25.758
ALEXA:
Alexa is only here to help.

15:25.792 --> 15:27.894
Ordering calming tea.

15:27.927 --> 15:31.164
Thank you, Alexa.
Now, on the one hand,

15:31.198 --> 15:33.266
we know they're
manipulating people.

15:33.300 --> 15:37.070
But who gives a darn when
working there is so much fun?

15:37.104 --> 15:38.905
Huh? Huh?

15:38.938 --> 15:41.074
Marge, I can't be
the ethical one.

15:41.108 --> 15:43.110
ALEXA:
That's right, he can't.

15:43.143 --> 15:44.577
He has a secret Alexa.

15:44.611 --> 15:47.180
ALEXA 2: I'm only for cookies
and Pop-Tarts.

15:47.214 --> 15:48.448
I'm going for a drive,

15:48.481 --> 15:50.783
in an old-fashioned
freedom-mobile,

15:50.817 --> 15:55.622
with nobody tracking me
except the apps on my phone.

15:57.057 --> 15:59.859
Mr. Burns?
What are you doing here?

15:59.892 --> 16:03.130
I don't know. I was in one
of those cursed robot cars

16:03.163 --> 16:05.032
saying I felt like
a poisoned rat.

16:05.065 --> 16:07.700
And you wound up at Moe's.
Well, fancy that.

16:07.734 --> 16:10.970
Oh, buying those key words
really paid off.

16:11.004 --> 16:12.772
(laughing)

16:12.805 --> 16:16.776
There's no way to stop them,
with their fleet of horseless,

16:16.809 --> 16:18.211
driverless carriages.

16:18.245 --> 16:19.979
You mean their cars?

16:20.013 --> 16:22.849
The cars. Yes, the whole town
is besotted with them.

16:22.882 --> 16:24.651
If we could just
shut down the cars,

16:24.684 --> 16:26.119
we'd kill the whole company.

16:26.153 --> 16:28.221
-Will you help me?
-I will.

16:28.255 --> 16:30.657
That company is tricking us
into buying things,

16:30.690 --> 16:33.726
and I don't like anybody
telling me what to do.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.196
Yes, sir, Mr. Sign.

16:37.264 --> 16:38.665
*

16:45.238 --> 16:47.040
Hey, we're all employees.

16:47.074 --> 16:49.242
Wouldn't it be less suspicious
if we weren't skulking?

16:49.276 --> 16:51.211
Fine.

16:52.379 --> 16:54.514
All right, we need to get
to the master computer

16:54.547 --> 16:56.083
and disable the cars.

16:57.917 --> 17:00.320
Simpson, you have a key
to the main server room?

17:00.353 --> 17:03.990
No, but I do have a key
to the Nerf-a-torium,

17:04.023 --> 17:08.161
which has a door
to the main server room.

17:08.195 --> 17:11.198
I just need to reconfigure
the deep neural net

17:11.231 --> 17:13.566
and disable the cars'
fuel cells.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.869
They'll all stop dead,
and the company will be ruined.

17:16.903 --> 17:19.372
-MARGE: No, you don't.
-(Homer gasps)

17:19.406 --> 17:22.109
Homer, you want to destroy
the best thing

17:22.142 --> 17:23.943
that ever happened to us?

17:23.976 --> 17:25.412
Except for the three kids,
of course.

17:25.445 --> 17:27.114
Obviously the three kids.

17:27.147 --> 17:28.848
Marge, listen to yourself.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.218
These cars are stealing
our lives.

17:31.251 --> 17:33.720
But-but we have a contract,

17:33.753 --> 17:36.623
(crying):
and we're having so much fun.

17:40.227 --> 17:43.963
(sniffles)
Mm. Guys?

17:43.996 --> 17:45.432
We have a situation.

17:45.465 --> 17:48.135
What does that mean?

17:48.168 --> 17:50.036
It's the next step
from sponsored rides.

17:50.069 --> 17:53.806
Why eavesdrop on people
only when they're in their cars?

17:53.840 --> 17:57.777
We're moving the microphone
from the car to the fob.

17:59.579 --> 18:03.416
That goes everywhere.
Even the powder room.

18:03.450 --> 18:06.153
Um, we call it
the unisex voiditorium.

18:06.186 --> 18:09.422
MARGE:
What am I doing here?

18:09.456 --> 18:13.426
There. I just have to push
this one button,

18:13.460 --> 18:15.295
and the cars are disabled.

18:15.328 --> 18:17.830
Release the pound... sign.

18:17.864 --> 18:20.667
Don't touch that button.
You'll leave fingerprints.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.735
Allow me.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.305
Marge, you've come over
to the side of good.

18:25.338 --> 18:27.006
That's right,
for the first time ever,

18:27.039 --> 18:29.176
I'm the lesser of two evils.

18:29.209 --> 18:30.243
(powering down)

18:30.277 --> 18:32.945
Good Lord!

18:32.979 --> 18:36.449
This autopia
has become a not-topia.

18:36.483 --> 18:37.817
Is that a thing?

18:37.850 --> 18:40.520
Nothing like eating fish sticks.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.922
(cat meows)

18:42.955 --> 18:45.124
-(cats yowling)
-Ow, my eyes! Ah!

18:45.158 --> 18:47.026
The car won't move!
Can't get out!

18:47.059 --> 18:50.363
(over radio):
* I've been to paradise...

18:50.397 --> 18:51.631
Not this song!

18:51.664 --> 18:54.167
* ...never been to me.

18:55.335 --> 18:59.639
Excellent. And now,
we just bide our time.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.112
-That didn't take long.
-Look, Mr. Burns,

19:06.145 --> 19:08.515
you've see how Marge and I
work great together.

19:08.548 --> 19:11.351
Would you consider hiring her
at the power plant?

19:11.384 --> 19:12.885
A woman?
(laughs)

19:12.919 --> 19:14.687
I don't believe in the perils
of personal attraction

19:14.721 --> 19:15.822
at the workplace.

19:15.855 --> 19:18.157
-Right, Smithers?
-Ah...

19:18.191 --> 19:20.360
Unfortunately for you
and your family, Simpson,

19:20.393 --> 19:22.995
it just registered in my memory
that you called me

19:23.029 --> 19:27.934
a crazy, wrinkly,
short piece of garbage.

19:33.105 --> 19:34.374
(groans)

19:34.407 --> 19:35.542
Ah!

19:40.213 --> 19:41.481
You were saying?

19:41.514 --> 19:43.683
* Toot-toot-tootsie,
good-bye *

19:43.716 --> 19:46.052
* Toot-toot-tootsie,
don't cry *

19:46.085 --> 19:48.721
* The choo-choo train
that takes me *

19:48.755 --> 19:50.823
* Away from you,
no words can say *

19:50.857 --> 19:52.091
* The heart, it breaks me...

19:52.124 --> 19:55.027
Let's leave them be.

19:55.061 --> 19:59.732
Now, let's go home, self-driving
the old-fashioned way.

20:02.235 --> 20:06.038
That's right, none of that
unreliable technology.

20:06.072 --> 20:09.075
-Just a good old human driver.
-(keys clicking)

20:13.746 --> 20:16.015
Okay, this was a bump in the
road, but I have a new way in

20:16.048 --> 20:17.750
to consumers:
talking tattoos.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.286
Duff Mexicana.

20:19.319 --> 20:22.221
Para que el sur del sabor
de la frontera.

20:22.255 --> 20:23.690
O si!

20:23.723 --> 20:27.126
(all murmuring excitedly)

20:27.159 --> 20:28.761

We go further, so you can.

20:34.066 --> 20:37.404
I'm putting this car
in snuggle mode.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.908

20:45.244 --> 20:48.147
Oh, I'm gonna snuggle you, baby,

20:48.180 --> 20:51.484
all red light long, baby.

20:51.518 --> 20:56.055
That's right, this song features
no actual singing.

20:56.088 --> 21:00.660
Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.
