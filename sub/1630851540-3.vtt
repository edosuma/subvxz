00:36.083 --> 00:38.375
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:55.583 --> 01:01.625
Well, let's play a game now
that the family has been reunited, right?

01:07.458 --> 01:09.000
The pleasures of life are important.

01:10.583 --> 01:11.958
Draw a piece of paper.

01:13.916 --> 01:14.833
Pick one.

01:16.958 --> 01:18.541
-Léonard, you really do have to--
-Do it.

01:31.000 --> 01:31.875
So…

01:33.041 --> 01:34.291
what's the name?

01:34.958 --> 01:35.875
Don't do this.

01:36.500 --> 01:38.833
-Give me. Hand it over.
-No, Léonard, please.

01:41.333 --> 01:42.208
Ibrahim.

01:43.791 --> 01:45.375
Is that one of your children?

01:47.375 --> 01:48.583
He's a baby.

01:49.416 --> 01:50.375
A baby.

01:51.541 --> 01:55.375
That's so precious. A baby is
worth 150K on the black market.

01:55.458 --> 01:59.166
Hey, José, tell Miguel to send
a guy to Paris to go get Ibrahim.

01:59.250 --> 02:00.916
I'm begging, please don't take my kids.

02:01.416 --> 02:03.125
Not my kids, please. Take, take William.

02:03.208 --> 02:05.333
-Actually, no, anybody but him.
-No. Mm-mm.

02:05.916 --> 02:07.541
Don't take William, please.

02:07.625 --> 02:09.875
He's my weak spot.
I, I love him more than my kids.

02:09.958 --> 02:12.875
Leave him alone.
All right, fine, take him.

02:13.375 --> 02:16.333
Now that I've thought about it,
he'll understand.

02:16.416 --> 02:19.125
I'm not a fool, Joseph.
We're sticking with little Ibrahim.

02:19.208 --> 02:20.708
And don't you even worry about it.

02:20.791 --> 02:24.000
In a perfect world, they'll treat him
like royalty, ooh, like a prince.

02:24.583 --> 02:26.416
Look, we didn't mean to run away from you.

02:26.500 --> 02:28.625
We didn't plan it,
we were just really high.

02:28.708 --> 02:30.958
-Yeah, okay.
-We weren't ourselves, we ate shrooms.

02:31.458 --> 02:33.375
We don't even know
how we ended up outside.

02:33.458 --> 02:36.166
And we wanted to come to
the monastery, but we got lost.

02:36.250 --> 02:38.041
Luckily, the police found us,

02:38.125 --> 02:40.625
and thank God they were corrupt
and brought us back here, to you.

02:40.708 --> 02:43.791
And, yeah, it was a dream come true
when they knew the way back here.

02:43.875 --> 02:44.708
It felt like a dream.

02:44.791 --> 02:46.833
-Like from a musical.
-Like, in The Ten Commandments.

02:46.916 --> 02:49.291
-Exactly.
-Wait, what are you guys talking about?

02:49.375 --> 02:51.791
Well, it's, uh, it's super famous.

02:51.875 --> 02:54.250
It's a musical, you know,
with Moses, right?

02:54.333 --> 02:57.250
He breaks the tablets.
It had a national tour, lots of singers.

02:57.333 --> 02:59.666
Remember, they,
they got that guy from Pow woW?

02:59.750 --> 03:02.375
He was the one that was bald on top,
with long hair in the back.

03:02.458 --> 03:03.708
If we saw him, we'd say,

03:03.791 --> 03:06.000
-shit, look at that, he's got a mullet.
-That's the truth.

03:06.083 --> 03:07.541
He played the Egyptian guy.

03:07.625 --> 03:09.375
-And he was so good.
-They were the bad guys.

03:09.458 --> 03:13.833
-The older brother sang Brothers Still.
-It was huge, the hit Brothers Still.

03:15.125 --> 03:16.666
This plexiglass sat between their hands,

03:16.750 --> 03:18.583
-and it represented glass.
-Represented the sea.

03:18.666 --> 03:21.041
-Yes, sea-- Yes.
-It represented more than plexiglass.

03:21.125 --> 03:23.375
-Dove Attia was the producer.
-Shut up!

03:23.458 --> 03:25.833
Okay, enough, assholes.
What about the magic mushrooms?

03:25.916 --> 03:28.500
All this
blabbering about a musical.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.583
-What shrooms?
-These shrooms.

03:31.750 --> 03:33.333
That's exactly what we took.

03:34.166 --> 03:37.583
These are exceptional mushrooms,
with hallucinogenic properties.

03:37.666 --> 03:40.291
Wait a minute. Where'd you get those?

03:41.250 --> 03:44.125
Uh, we've been developing
it with my Grandma.

03:44.208 --> 03:47.666
And, um, well, as you can see,
we were about to put it on the market.

03:48.125 --> 03:50.291
The timing wasn't right,
but this stuff is unreal.

03:50.875 --> 03:51.916
It's very potent.

03:52.916 --> 03:55.291
No joke, it was gonna be
a new business for the family,

03:55.375 --> 03:58.083
but you captured us
and it derailed all of our plans.

03:58.166 --> 03:59.875
But maybe we could produce it together.

03:59.958 --> 04:01.916
That would be great
to have him as a partner.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.666
-This could make us a ton of money.
-Right. It's a cash machine.

04:05.166 --> 04:06.666
Wait, you're fucking with me, right?

04:06.750 --> 04:07.791
-No way.
-No.

04:07.875 --> 04:10.375
If you're lying to me I'll put you
in a closet filled with rabbits

04:10.458 --> 04:12.541
and you'll be sucking my dick
and begging me for mercy.

04:12.625 --> 04:14.708
-No, this is real, I swear.
-Begging me. Understand?

04:14.791 --> 04:16.666
-Yes, of course.
-Léonard, try them.

04:17.250 --> 04:18.708
Try them and see for yourself.

04:18.791 --> 04:21.500
They're disgusting though. They
taste bitter and they're really slimy.

04:21.583 --> 04:24.291
But that's why we
came up with this great idea.

04:24.375 --> 04:26.875
-We're putting them inside falafel balls.
-That's right.

04:26.958 --> 04:30.083
Inside chickpea balls.
We'll call it Falafel LSD.

04:30.166 --> 04:31.583
-Yep. Mm-hmm. Yep.
-FalafeLSD.

04:31.666 --> 04:34.291
-Very catchy. It's a little play on words.
-Yeah.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.541
To boost our sales.

04:35.625 --> 04:37.500
No, hold on a second.
Look at him, okay?

04:37.583 --> 04:39.625
Léonard isn't ready for a trip like this.

04:40.125 --> 04:43.041
It's like putting him in a space shuttle
when he's never been on a plane.

04:43.125 --> 04:45.875
Aah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It really
might be too much for you Léonard.

04:45.958 --> 04:47.666
What are you saying,
you old motherfucker.

04:47.750 --> 04:50.083
-You impotent old geezer.
-They're really strong.

04:50.166 --> 04:52.083
Don't. Whoa. Three is a lot.

04:52.166 --> 04:53.000
Oh boy.

04:56.708 --> 04:58.500
Yeah, that's a long trip there.

05:20.500 --> 05:21.333
Who's she?

05:22.000 --> 05:23.875
-Oh. I'm Catherine.
-Oh.

05:23.958 --> 05:26.708
-Hi Joseph.
-Uh, she's, she's my, uh…

05:27.541 --> 05:29.625
They thought
she was working with us.

05:29.708 --> 05:30.833
-Okay.
-Yeah.

05:31.833 --> 05:33.083
-Nice to meet you
-My pleasure.

05:47.416 --> 05:49.750
Come puppy, come here sweetie, come.

05:49.833 --> 05:52.166
Youssef, he's talking.
Youssef, he's talking.

05:52.250 --> 05:53.791
Yeah, right.

05:57.500 --> 05:59.166
"Dobro je," that means "it's good."

05:59.250 --> 06:00.958
But what does
"leksh-mi-bols" mean, Youssef?

06:01.041 --> 06:03.208
I mean, I've never heard leksh-mi-bols.

06:03.291 --> 06:05.958
I'm telling you
this Bolshevik is not making it easy.

06:06.041 --> 06:09.875
Leksh-mi-bols.

06:09.958 --> 06:11.916
Fuck! What the fuck.

06:12.458 --> 06:13.458
I can't find it.

06:13.541 --> 06:17.416
-Leksh-mi-bols.
-Leksh-mi-bols, mi-bols, leksh…

06:20.041 --> 06:20.875
Holy shit.

06:22.125 --> 06:24.041
-Lick my balls.
-Huh?

06:24.541 --> 06:25.750
He's speaking Russian.

06:26.916 --> 06:28.750
He told the puppy to lick his balls.

06:28.833 --> 06:30.875
-What the fuck are you talking about?
-Of course.

06:30.958 --> 06:33.291
Makes sense.
I would've done the same thing.

06:33.375 --> 06:34.958
-So would you.
-No.

06:35.666 --> 06:37.125
That's a good boy.

06:37.750 --> 06:39.000
No, no. No, not the weenie.

06:39.083 --> 06:40.416
Oh, fuck no, you're right.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.416
-Hot, right? Huh?
-Oh, he's disgusting.

06:43.500 --> 06:46.416
Hold on, listen. He's, yep,
he's going for the shit-box now.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.125
All right, all right, all right, stop.

06:48.208 --> 06:51.000
Sounds like the fucker is
enjoying it, too, my God.

06:51.083 --> 06:53.041
-You're so weird, I swear.
-Oh, oh, oh.

06:53.125 --> 06:55.750
That's good. Yeah, that's good.

06:55.833 --> 06:57.125
-Clém?
-Huh?

06:57.833 --> 06:59.208
What happened to Giroud's hand?

06:59.791 --> 07:03.416
-Uh, uh, oh yeah, I got the munchies.
-Oh. Ah.

07:03.500 --> 07:04.708
Are you fucking kidding me?

07:05.708 --> 07:07.583
I mean, it's so good, I loved it.

07:07.666 --> 07:09.166
Not as much as him, though.

07:10.666 --> 07:12.833
The puppy's really going for it.
Holy fucking shit.

07:13.875 --> 07:15.750
Oh, there's gotta be
some poop left in there.

07:16.333 --> 07:17.666
Yeah, dogs love that.

07:17.750 --> 07:19.916
Little dingleberries in the hair,
they love them.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.250
Naughty doggies.

07:30.291 --> 07:32.291
You can't sleep my love? You okay?

07:32.875 --> 07:34.041
Yes, I'm all right.

07:36.166 --> 07:37.708
Just thinking about that guy,

07:38.500 --> 07:41.375
it's been a while since he ate
those mushrooms. I hope he's not dead.

07:42.333 --> 07:44.666
Well, I hope he is dead,
that son of a bitch.

07:45.166 --> 07:46.291
He can die.

07:47.250 --> 07:49.166
What am I thinking, you're right, my love.

07:49.250 --> 07:50.750
Yeah, I hope he's dead, too.

07:51.666 --> 07:52.666
Son of a bitch.

07:54.166 --> 07:56.500
Then again, he's very young.
It would be sad.

07:58.416 --> 08:01.250
You say things like that
because you're too kind.

08:02.750 --> 08:05.500
But then again,
that's what I love about you.

08:13.458 --> 08:14.625
You know, Catherine…

08:17.250 --> 08:19.375
I think I could give up my life for you.

08:23.166 --> 08:25.458
When we get out of here,
we'll jump on my boat,

08:25.958 --> 08:28.916
we'll travel around the world,
just you and me alone, all right?

08:30.791 --> 08:32.041
-Yeah, all right.
-Yeah.

08:36.416 --> 08:37.500
Fuck!

08:37.583 --> 08:39.625
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:39.708 --> 08:42.375
The mushrooms you guys
gave me were a slap to the face.

08:42.458 --> 08:46.375
Just exceptional! I was slammed in the
head with a shovel from outer space.

08:46.458 --> 08:48.583
I mean, let me tell you about it, okay?

08:48.666 --> 08:49.958
I was on a fucking journey,

08:50.041 --> 08:52.583
I was in this enclosed bubble, really.

08:52.666 --> 08:55.291
It turns out it was my mother's uterus,

08:55.375 --> 08:57.041
but I only realized it afterwards.

08:57.125 --> 08:59.791
Boom!

08:59.875 --> 09:02.875
And I popped out of it.
Yeah, I flew right out of her vagina.

09:02.958 --> 09:06.625
I was born a second time. I was
reborn during, during the trip, so I…

09:07.875 --> 09:12.958
So that's why I wanted to ask you if you
could make me a kilo of those falafels?

09:13.041 --> 09:14.750
The stuff you mentioned before.

09:14.833 --> 09:16.166
-Uh-huh.
-For the next two weeks

09:16.250 --> 09:17.833
you, you'll make those for me, okay?

09:17.916 --> 09:20.958
Oh, okay. Perfect.
We'll start tomorrow morning then, right?

09:21.041 --> 09:24.083
So then, after that, after that,
we'll see if you make it work,

09:24.625 --> 09:27.375
maybe you'll get
a shitload of orders,

09:27.458 --> 09:30.333
and then after that,
I'll leave his kids alone.

09:30.416 --> 09:31.333
All right?

09:31.833 --> 09:34.958
And, uh, and could we
eventually, eventually when,

09:35.041 --> 09:37.958
when you have the time,
maybe we could hear from Grandma.

09:38.041 --> 09:41.583
Hey, first, you need to write me a
list of the equipment you need, then…

09:41.666 --> 09:44.208
-Of course. Great.
-…we'll talk about it, at that time.

09:44.291 --> 09:46.083
All right. And I'll figure out everything,

09:46.166 --> 09:48.375
get you what you need.
I really have to thank you,

09:48.458 --> 09:50.625
that product gave--
you gave me was a treat, no joke.

09:50.708 --> 09:53.541
And, if you get this done,
it will work in your favor.

09:54.291 --> 09:55.208
All right?

09:56.166 --> 09:58.541
And please say hi to
whoever for me, you'll tell 'em.

10:02.208 --> 10:03.708
Well, he did eat three.

10:03.791 --> 10:08.666
Well, I don't know who
Pénélope is, but, uh, that poor girl.

10:08.750 --> 10:10.708
They're lovers, that's for sure.

10:11.958 --> 10:13.958
To have a tattoo
just above his stink star,

10:14.041 --> 10:15.708
she must have eaten it out a lot.

10:15.791 --> 10:16.958
Eating what?

10:17.458 --> 10:18.666
Stink star.

10:18.750 --> 10:20.041
What's that?

10:20.625 --> 10:23.041
Out the bunghole, the mud clam.

10:24.916 --> 10:27.041
-Jo!
-What? I'm sorry.

10:27.625 --> 10:29.791
Everyone knows
what a stink star is.

10:56.291 --> 10:58.666
He must have spread Nutella on his balls.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.375
Poor Gaëtan.

11:01.958 --> 11:04.208
I hope he'll only get a bad colic.

11:06.708 --> 11:09.000
Youssef! It's ringing.

11:09.083 --> 11:09.916
Mm.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.041
-Hello, Mr. Cavillan?
-Cavillan!

11:12.125 --> 11:15.500
He said Cavillan! I said he was our guy.
Did I or did I not say that, huh?

11:15.583 --> 11:17.916
-Yeah, alright. Shut up and listen.
-He's our guy, I knew it.

11:18.916 --> 11:20.083
What setback?

11:21.500 --> 11:22.333
What?

11:23.291 --> 11:26.958
You wanna postpone for two weeks?
That complicates things, Mr. Cavillan.

11:27.541 --> 11:30.958
I don't know if the surgeon will
be available and to harvest the organs.

11:33.625 --> 11:35.416
Ah, okay, okay.

11:35.500 --> 11:38.375
In that case, I'll need to
find another surgeon as a backup.

11:38.875 --> 11:40.791
-Will do, I'll let you know.
-Oh, shit!

11:41.458 --> 11:42.416
Those bastards.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.208
They want to remove their genitalia.

11:46.291 --> 11:47.833
You missed the point completely.

11:48.333 --> 11:51.041
They're talking about
organ trafficking, kidneys and lungs.

11:52.166 --> 11:55.208
Hmm. So Olivier's dick will be intact.

11:57.041 --> 11:59.083
Kidneys, they're important too, though.

11:59.166 --> 12:00.958
-Of course they're important.
-Hmm.

12:01.041 --> 12:03.250
He said that he's
looking to hire a surgeon.

12:03.916 --> 12:05.416
That could work in our favor.

12:05.500 --> 12:08.125
We need to go see him
and convince him to hire us.

12:09.958 --> 12:12.583
Olivier's dick, though…Hmm.

12:13.375 --> 12:15.041
I miss it so much. Mm-hmm.

12:16.458 --> 12:19.833
Whenever it's brought up, I can feel
my heart close and my pussy open right up.

12:20.333 --> 12:22.375
Seriously, that's enough, okay Clémentine?

12:22.458 --> 12:24.291
I mean, honestly,
you're giving me a headache.

12:24.375 --> 12:27.000
We need to stop talking about it.
I don't have extra panties.

12:29.041 --> 12:31.000
Stop.

12:32.416 --> 12:35.583
The mushrooms are growing over here,
behind the gutter. Check it out.

12:36.083 --> 12:37.041
-All right, yeah.
-See?

12:37.625 --> 12:40.166
-There's a fuckload of them.
-Hey. Aure?

12:41.041 --> 12:42.125
Nice job back there.

12:43.291 --> 12:47.166
That'll give us some time to get
organized and to find a way out of here.

12:48.125 --> 12:49.583
What are you saying?

12:49.666 --> 12:51.208
-What am I saying?
-Yeah.

12:51.291 --> 12:52.458
I need to escape.

12:52.541 --> 12:55.000
I have to warn Aïda
and the kids they are not safe.

12:55.083 --> 12:57.291
Well, the reason they're in danger,

12:57.375 --> 13:00.666
is because you two tried
to break out of here. Dumb asses.

13:02.666 --> 13:04.208
Were you even gonna come back for us?

13:04.291 --> 13:06.791
Are you being serious?
Of course we were, Aure.

13:06.875 --> 13:09.375
-I'm just asking.
-The reason we left was to get help.

13:09.458 --> 13:11.250
It's a lost cause, man.
The police are corrupt.

13:11.333 --> 13:12.708
Léonard has everyone in his pocket.

13:12.791 --> 13:14.291
Right, so we agree then,

13:14.375 --> 13:16.708
enough with trying to escape.
Let's focus on production.

13:16.791 --> 13:19.333
Aure, we don't even know how to
make these stupid shrooms of yours.

13:19.416 --> 13:20.791
Wait, hold on. It was a lie?

13:21.375 --> 13:22.791
The shrooms aren't from Ludmila?

13:23.375 --> 13:26.375
No, they're not from Ludmila,
but I know how to make them.

13:26.541 --> 13:28.833
Grandma showed me
how to multiply them once,

13:28.916 --> 13:30.333
Mycelium is pretty basic shit.

13:30.833 --> 13:32.500
So, mycelium is pretty basic shit, huh?

13:32.583 --> 13:36.416
You know, Catherine studied biology.
You could help, right?

13:36.916 --> 13:39.583
-Yes, that's true. I know the basics.
-That's perfect.

13:40.083 --> 13:42.291
The basics, yeah right. She's very good.

13:42.375 --> 13:44.375
And plus, she's a huge Enrico fan.

13:44.958 --> 13:48.375
-What about it?
-What about it? I'm just letting you know.

13:48.458 --> 13:49.625
A huge fan.

13:50.208 --> 13:52.916
That's great. All right, look,
Catherine, I really don't know you, uh,

13:53.000 --> 13:54.583
and I got nothing against you,

13:54.666 --> 13:57.250
but I'm not betting my kids' lives
on your high school biology.

13:57.333 --> 14:00.375
Or on your knowledge of
mycelium that came out of nowhere.

14:00.458 --> 14:03.250
I totally screwed up, okay,
at the Bastra, okay?

14:03.333 --> 14:05.750
But I can grow these shrooms.
Do you trust me or not?

14:07.041 --> 14:09.125
Fine, okay, okay, okay. Go ahead.

14:09.958 --> 14:12.333
I trust you. Do it,
go ahead, do it. Do it.

14:12.958 --> 14:14.166
Thanks, Jo.

14:17.416 --> 14:18.791
I don't trust her one bit.

14:19.791 --> 14:22.250
I guarantee you
these mushrooms will be a home run.

14:22.333 --> 14:25.291
I know it's gonna be great.
You'll see, we're in for a treat.

14:25.375 --> 14:27.500
I don't think we're ready
for what's gonna happen.

14:27.583 --> 14:29.958
And you need to be watching them closely,

14:30.041 --> 14:32.166
you need to really
analyze how they make them

14:32.250 --> 14:34.041
to find out how they do it.

14:34.125 --> 14:36.916
You don't get it.
There's no shrooms. They lied to you.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.125
They never developed it with Ludmila,
they don't have a clue.

14:40.208 --> 14:41.833
Don't smoke in my office.

14:41.916 --> 14:43.875
But, wait, uh, with or without Ludmila,

14:43.958 --> 14:47.166
if they sold it to me, they think
they're capable of making them, right?

14:47.833 --> 14:50.166
-Perhaps.
-All right. So, what are we risking?

14:50.250 --> 14:52.666
We're risking
getting in trouble with the cartel.

14:52.750 --> 14:53.958
I forbid you from doing it.

14:54.041 --> 14:55.458
You forbid me from doing it?

14:55.541 --> 14:58.708
-Yes, I forbid you.
-All right. Very well.

14:58.791 --> 15:01.083
Let's go talk with Gérard and let him know

15:01.166 --> 15:04.208
you'd rather have his grandchildren
killed than do some botany.

15:04.708 --> 15:07.916
Let's see the look on his face when
he finds out who's behind the mask. Come.

15:10.875 --> 15:11.916
After you, Mom.

15:14.833 --> 15:15.833
Okay.

15:16.791 --> 15:17.750
All right, Léonard.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.083
That's enough.

15:19.916 --> 15:20.750
I'll go back.

15:22.125 --> 15:23.125
Wise decision.

15:23.833 --> 15:24.666
That's a good Mommy.

15:24.750 --> 15:26.500
-But if you want to keep 'em in line,
-Uh-huh.

15:26.583 --> 15:29.291
you should ask for news
about Ludmila from Guzman.

15:42.083 --> 15:44.083
Can you pass me the shampoo, please?

15:46.291 --> 15:48.875
Aure? Can you pass the shampoo?

15:50.291 --> 15:51.250
Are you all right?

15:53.000 --> 15:54.500
Yeah, of course. I'm sorry.

15:55.750 --> 15:57.375
-Here.
-Thank you.

15:58.250 --> 15:59.791
It's just those two morons,

15:59.875 --> 16:02.791
they make me fucking doubt myself.
I'm stressed out.

16:04.541 --> 16:06.875
Now I'm not even sure
I can make the shrooms.

16:09.416 --> 16:12.083
Don't listen to them.
Of course you can do it.

16:13.750 --> 16:16.250
And I'll help you, we'll do it together.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.833
Okay? Don't stress.

16:22.125 --> 16:23.083
Thank you.

16:24.166 --> 16:26.625
That's kind of you.
You're right, you're right.

16:47.833 --> 16:49.791
Oh, son of a bitch.

16:51.291 --> 16:53.000
-Gérard?
-What?

16:53.083 --> 16:54.500
I saw my dad when I was tripping.

16:54.583 --> 16:57.125
-Oh, really? Well, that's fantastic.
-Yeah.

16:57.625 --> 16:58.541
And how was he?

16:58.625 --> 17:00.708
Turns out he was
an officer in Mesrine's gang.

17:00.791 --> 17:02.291
A real bandito, an ex-con.

17:02.375 --> 17:03.916
-Handsome, too.
-Oh, hold on. No, no, no.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.708
That's way too heavy for my darling, here.

17:05.791 --> 17:08.041
-Olivier's got that.
-Thank you so much.

17:08.125 --> 17:10.083
I'm sharing this because he was a thug.

17:10.166 --> 17:11.916
So, it makes sense that it's in my blood.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.333
Oh, yeah, yeah.
But it was just a hallucination.

17:16.041 --> 17:18.833
Yeah, but I mean, is there
anything else you know about him?

17:32.375 --> 17:33.333
Hey.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.791
Have you started yet? All good?

17:35.875 --> 17:37.333
-Yeah, all good here.
-Great.

17:37.416 --> 17:39.708
-Ah, Mr. Léonard.
-Yeah?

17:39.791 --> 17:40.791
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

17:40.875 --> 17:43.166
I have a small request for you, right?

17:43.250 --> 17:47.750
It's not a big ask. Would it be possible
to have a small bedroom setup in here?

17:47.833 --> 17:49.958
For Catherine and me so we could, uh…

17:50.041 --> 17:51.708
You know what I mean, right?
What?

17:51.791 --> 17:53.833
Because with the kids always around,

17:53.916 --> 17:57.125
-It-- it's complicated, right?
-Well, there's no way. It's not happening.

17:57.208 --> 17:59.583
This place is off-limits at night.
I'm locking it up.

17:59.666 --> 18:02.000
This isn't a dorm, and it's
not your mom's house either, man.

18:02.083 --> 18:03.333
Well, my mother, she…

18:03.833 --> 18:05.083
Well, what about her?

18:05.166 --> 18:06.750
-No, nothing.
-Right.

18:07.791 --> 18:10.166
Look, consider this your final warning.

18:10.250 --> 18:12.125
You have two weeks to
deliver the mushrooms.

18:12.625 --> 18:16.500
And, should this all go wrong
for some reason, which we don't want,

18:17.000 --> 18:20.291
I'm sorry to say, things will turn out
very bad for this guy's children.

18:20.375 --> 18:22.041
Have I made myself clear?

18:22.875 --> 18:23.916
Yes, you have.

18:24.916 --> 18:27.666
-Very clear, yes. However…
-Very well.

18:28.541 --> 18:31.750
would it be possible
to have contact with our grandma?

18:31.833 --> 18:34.375
Oh yes, I have a surprise for you.
Come with me.

18:35.208 --> 18:36.291
Come.

18:41.416 --> 18:44.041
Yeah, fine Pablo, that's enough.
I'm not a moron.

18:44.125 --> 18:45.291
I know where to look.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.500
I'm old but I've seen a camera before.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.416
My bubbelehs,

18:50.000 --> 18:51.166
I miss you all.

18:52.541 --> 18:55.000
They take good care of me here,
for the most part.

18:55.500 --> 18:58.750
But I've been warned that I
shouldn't be a smart ass to these guys,

18:58.833 --> 19:00.458
or they'll punish all of you.

19:00.958 --> 19:04.875
I assume that works both ways,
so don't any of you be smart asses either.

19:05.375 --> 19:07.583
As you can see,
my crops are growing nicely.

19:07.666 --> 19:11.208
What is it now, you don't see
I'm speaking to my family? Huh?

19:11.291 --> 19:13.000
Shut your mouth, asshole.

19:13.916 --> 19:15.500
I'm learning Spanish really fast.

19:15.583 --> 19:18.083
Son of a bitch.

19:18.166 --> 19:20.583
They paired me with
a moron who's dumb as a rock.

19:21.166 --> 19:24.541
-She couldn't care less. It's crazy.
-I bet she gives him hell.

19:26.541 --> 19:28.791
-So…
-Yeah, looking good.

19:31.708 --> 19:33.625
Well, my dear Aure,

19:34.958 --> 19:36.500
I think about you.

19:37.583 --> 19:38.750
Trust yourself

19:39.250 --> 19:41.458
and make the right
decisions for the family.

19:41.541 --> 19:42.583
Fill it up to 2.5.

19:43.500 --> 19:45.500
They seem tough, but the truth is

19:46.333 --> 19:48.500
they need you more than you need them.

19:49.833 --> 19:55.166
Gérard, even though I don't always see
eye to eye with those camel eyes of yours,

19:55.666 --> 19:59.333
I didn't think I'd ever say this,
but I miss you.

19:59.416 --> 20:00.250
There.

20:00.916 --> 20:02.250
That's not French.

20:02.333 --> 20:05.916
No one ever complains around here
like you do, oy, it bums me out.

20:06.708 --> 20:07.750
Olivier,

20:07.833 --> 20:10.083
I know you're upset about Clémentine,

20:11.208 --> 20:14.750
but don't worry. I'm sure
things will work out just fine.

20:17.541 --> 20:19.166
And as for you, Joseph,

20:19.833 --> 20:21.166
my little prince,

20:21.875 --> 20:24.458
you tried to sacrifice
yourself to save our lives.

20:24.958 --> 20:26.666
That was very generous, bubbeleh.

20:26.750 --> 20:28.375
But like I said, it was stupid.

20:29.208 --> 20:32.375
At my age, I was the one who had to go.

20:33.166 --> 20:35.541
So I hope you're not
angry with me anymore.

20:36.125 --> 20:38.875
You still have so much
to share with your children.

20:38.958 --> 20:40.625
You have a future to build,

20:41.333 --> 20:44.083
even though it may not
be the one you expected.

20:46.291 --> 20:50.708
But it's also a good thing
to let destiny surprise you.

20:52.416 --> 20:54.833
And even at times
when everything goes wrong,

20:55.583 --> 20:56.708
don't worry,

20:57.666 --> 21:00.541
remind yourself that life
has surprises in store for us

21:00.666 --> 21:02.625
that we could never have imagined.

21:07.583 --> 21:08.791
And if we stick together,

21:10.083 --> 21:11.750
if we listen to each other,

21:12.500 --> 21:15.750
and when all that energy
converges in the same direction,

21:15.833 --> 21:17.791
we can accomplish extraordinary things.

21:17.875 --> 21:18.833
We did it!

21:20.875 --> 21:22.791
When a family works together,

21:22.875 --> 21:24.708
well, my darlings…

21:26.208 --> 21:27.708
we're indestructible.

21:29.250 --> 21:30.750
All right, I'm finished, I'm done.

21:30.833 --> 21:32.750
The moron is waving at me now.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.125
I have to get back to the crops.

21:35.208 --> 21:37.291
My loves, my children, my bubbelehs,

21:37.375 --> 21:39.750
be careful, be strong, and be brave.

21:39.833 --> 21:41.583
You're with me and I love you.

21:43.833 --> 21:45.500
Okay, I'll give the falafels a go.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.416
Let's dip them in and see if it works.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.458
-Damn, they're browning perfectly.
-Yeah.

21:51.541 --> 21:54.541
But, Jo, we can't leave them in for
too long 'cause they'll burn and be gross.

21:54.625 --> 21:56.375
You got this? I really don't give a shit.

21:57.458 --> 21:59.041
-Oh, shit!
-Fuck!

21:59.125 --> 22:00.458
-Oh, shit, shit.
-What the hell?

22:00.541 --> 22:03.583
-What kind of a shitty lamp is this?
-Are you okay? Let me see.

22:03.666 --> 22:06.541
Nothing fucking works around here.
How are we supposed to work?

22:06.625 --> 22:08.416
What do you mean, nothing works?

22:08.500 --> 22:10.666
It's not a shitty lamp.
It's a lamp, it's fragile.

22:10.750 --> 22:13.000
But if you keep knocking
it around, eventually, boom.

22:13.083 --> 22:14.583
She's stressed the fuck out.

22:15.833 --> 22:17.750
Got a bad feeling about these shrooms.

22:18.541 --> 22:20.000
-Hey, bro?
-What?

22:20.958 --> 22:23.041
I spotted a computer
in the room next to us.

22:23.125 --> 22:25.750
-Okay. There?
-Just behind this wall, yeah, a computer.

22:26.333 --> 22:30.041
We gotta find a way, I haven't figured
out how yet, but we have to get to it.

22:30.125 --> 22:32.166
That way I can warn Aïda
and she can hide the kids.

22:32.250 --> 22:33.833
Bro, you need to calm down.

22:33.916 --> 22:36.166
The shrooms look like
they're working, we'll be fine.

22:36.250 --> 22:37.458
They look like they're working?

22:37.541 --> 22:39.291
For all we know,
they're baby bella mushrooms.

22:39.375 --> 22:40.791
They're, they're great in salads,

22:40.875 --> 22:43.333
but if they don't get you high,
we'll sell your children.

22:43.833 --> 22:45.875
What's that?

22:45.958 --> 22:47.166
That thing's dangerous.

22:47.250 --> 22:49.500
Just stay back and I'll
turn down the gas a bit. Okay.

22:51.916 --> 22:52.833
Hold on, bro.

22:54.791 --> 22:56.166
That could be a bomb, right?

22:56.250 --> 22:59.083
Of course it'll be bomb, bro. I worked
at the top falafel place in Paris.

22:59.666 --> 23:01.791
You-- I'm not talking about falafel, hmar!

23:01.875 --> 23:03.958
I'm talking about a real bomb.

23:04.041 --> 23:05.000
Hey, look.

23:06.083 --> 23:07.666
We take this, the gas tank,

23:08.458 --> 23:10.916
we put it against that wall.
Bam! It'll blow up.

23:11.541 --> 23:12.500
We get the computer.

23:12.583 --> 23:15.041
What about Léonard seeing
a big hole and freaking out?

23:15.125 --> 23:18.958
It was an accident. Fryer accidents
happen all the time in restaurants.

23:21.083 --> 23:22.250
All right, I agree there.

23:23.250 --> 23:24.250
So we're doing this?

23:25.500 --> 23:26.333
Yeah.

23:26.916 --> 23:28.416
But we can't tell the others.

23:28.500 --> 23:30.166
Zip, not a word.

23:30.666 --> 23:32.250
-Give me the falafel.
-Let's do the rest.

23:32.333 --> 23:34.000
-Let's finish.
-I'll just take these out.

23:34.083 --> 23:36.000
-The first batch looks beautiful.
-Clear-- Oh wow!

23:36.083 --> 23:39.666
-They're fried to perfection. Perfect.
-We're up to some great things here, mmm?

24:10.041 --> 24:14.166
This is the new recipe here,
the difference is a tiny pinch of cumin.

24:14.250 --> 24:16.416
-Hmm, a pinch of cumin.
-Yeah.

24:16.500 --> 24:19.833
That's Uncle Andre's little secret.

24:19.916 --> 24:22.000
Thanks so much, Joseph,

24:22.083 --> 24:24.291
it's very important
for me to learn the traditions.

24:24.375 --> 24:27.000
The pleasure was mine, Catherine.
No secrets between us, right?

24:27.083 --> 24:29.250
No. Thank you.

24:29.333 --> 24:31.000
See you later.

24:35.291 --> 24:37.208
Why is she always here sniffing around?

24:37.708 --> 24:40.833
She makes notes in her little book.
What a pain in my ass.

24:41.666 --> 24:43.708
Well, she can sniff my ass
whenever she wants.

24:43.791 --> 24:46.666
She can stick her head into it.
She's more than welcome.

24:47.166 --> 24:48.833
You're out of your mind, she's hot, bro.

24:48.916 --> 24:50.541
It's gross, bro, it really is.

24:50.625 --> 24:52.125
-Sorry, but seriously…
-C'mon.

24:52.208 --> 24:54.250
You have to admit,
Gérard scored big time with her.

24:54.333 --> 24:56.750
She looks like
the best dancer at a strip club.

24:56.833 --> 24:57.916
Check her out.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.125
She makes me feel like a child again.

25:00.208 --> 25:01.875
I swear it, the first
Saturday of the month,

25:01.958 --> 25:04.375
in one hand a Kleenex, the porn channel…

25:04.875 --> 25:07.166
That's very cute but,
more like the public access channel.

25:07.250 --> 25:09.791
On a Sunday night,
a library show about nothing

25:09.875 --> 25:12.583
but ugly chicks, and a, and a
Kleenex would be for wiping my ass

25:12.666 --> 25:15.166
-because the show is crap.
-What? You don't think she's hot?

25:15.250 --> 25:17.750
Dude, you're pissing me off.
What about the bomb?

25:17.833 --> 25:19.708
Come on, show me the fucking bomb.

25:19.791 --> 25:21.208
Easy, easy, take it easy.

25:21.291 --> 25:22.583
I'm on it, it's fine.

25:28.125 --> 25:30.500
-You hook it up like that?
-Yeah, don't worry about it.

25:30.583 --> 25:31.916
It's in my blood.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
I told you my father was a real thug.

25:34.083 --> 25:36.541
Bro, you know biology
isn't everything, okay?

25:36.625 --> 25:38.333
Education matters the most.

25:39.541 --> 25:41.541
Come on, put that away. Let's go.

25:46.208 --> 25:47.583
You're really strong to admit that.

25:48.166 --> 25:50.000
Hmm? Hmm?

25:50.083 --> 25:53.500
With everything happening with the
triplets, I think it's very brave of you.

25:53.583 --> 25:55.208
Hmm, meaning?

25:55.291 --> 25:57.500
Well, you know,
if we don't make it out of here…

25:57.583 --> 25:59.375
Not that that will happen.

25:59.458 --> 26:02.041
But if we don't,
William will raise your kids.

26:02.125 --> 26:03.666
That's a hard thing to accept.

26:08.541 --> 26:10.791
-That's not what I said.
-Kinda is, bro.

26:10.875 --> 26:13.416
It's not what I meant.
I was saying that, in the end,

26:13.500 --> 26:15.291
education is kind of important, yeah sure,

26:15.375 --> 26:17.583
it's pretty cute,
but it's not the main thing.

26:17.666 --> 26:19.583
What matters most
is the biological father.

26:19.666 --> 26:21.416
That's what passes down to the child.

26:21.500 --> 26:23.750
DNA, it, it, it gives off vibes, you know,

26:23.833 --> 26:25.416
the personality, the good looks,

26:25.500 --> 26:26.833
that's the really important thing.

26:26.916 --> 26:29.791
What's education but
a little polish on top of the car?

26:29.875 --> 26:33.416
But the biological father
is the car, not the polish.

26:34.666 --> 26:36.333
All right, then I'm a real bandito.

26:36.416 --> 26:38.416
Fuck yes, bro, you're a real bandito.

26:39.833 --> 26:41.666
Don't let anyone
tell you otherwise, brother.

26:44.416 --> 26:45.333
Thanks, bro.

26:48.666 --> 26:50.875
Allow me to
introduce myself, Mr. Finanouk,

26:50.958 --> 26:52.083
I am Muriel Prévot,

26:52.166 --> 26:56.000
former surgeon, and I specialize
in all kinds of organ transplants.

26:57.500 --> 26:59.375
Bladder, liver, eyes…

26:59.458 --> 27:01.333
And this is my assistant,

27:01.416 --> 27:03.125
Mohammed Ben Affleck.

27:03.208 --> 27:04.916
What? No, I'm not…

27:05.416 --> 27:08.500
Ben Aflahak. "Lahak,"
like the righteousness.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.750
But, as we were saying,

27:10.833 --> 27:12.750
we're in the middle of a career change.

27:13.250 --> 27:15.541
We're looking for a more stress-free life.

27:15.625 --> 27:18.750
That's why we, uh…

27:18.833 --> 27:21.875
That's why we're here,
we want to open up a hookah bar.

27:21.958 --> 27:24.166
A bar with hoo-kitty cats, meow.

27:24.250 --> 27:26.250
A bar with cats and hookahs.

27:26.333 --> 27:27.416
-No, that's--
-Yes.

27:27.500 --> 27:30.541
Hookah bars are hot, cat bars too,
so why not put the two together?

27:30.625 --> 27:31.541
Huh?

27:31.625 --> 27:34.500
Whiskas-flavored hookahs.
Meow Mix, Royal Canine, Fancy Feast!

27:34.583 --> 27:38.375
The dry toilet would be a
gigantic litter box, very eco-friendly.

27:38.458 --> 27:42.166
The customers could scrape the litter
themselves to cover their excrements.

27:42.250 --> 27:44.125
You'd have little
surprise lumps you could find,

27:44.208 --> 27:46.458
"What's this? Whoopsy daisy,
it's a turd!"

27:46.541 --> 27:48.541
I have a question,
I see here that you have

27:48.625 --> 27:50.666
a gap period of four years.

27:50.750 --> 27:53.125
There's nothing written on your resume.

27:53.916 --> 27:55.500
Ah, right, nice job.

27:56.208 --> 27:57.291
He's really good.

27:58.875 --> 27:59.708
Mohammed,

28:00.208 --> 28:01.416
you can tell him.

28:01.500 --> 28:02.500
Go on, then.

28:03.083 --> 28:06.166
There's nothing to be afraid of.
You've paid your debt to society.

28:06.250 --> 28:07.333
Be brave, say it.

28:09.166 --> 28:12.041
-I was locked up for a-- robbery.
-Robbery.

28:12.625 --> 28:14.458
And since Mr. Ben Afhack--

28:14.541 --> 28:18.041
-Hak. Hak.
-Hock. Ah.

28:18.125 --> 28:22.125
It's hard. Anyways, since
Mr. Mohammed is a principled man,

28:23.083 --> 28:25.958
'cause he refused to
snitch on his accomplices,

28:26.041 --> 28:28.125
since "snitches get the stitches,"

28:28.625 --> 28:31.375
he served his time. Hmm.

28:31.458 --> 28:34.083
Exactly, now to get back to our project,

28:34.166 --> 28:38.500
that's why, all things considered,
we'd like to be approved for 150,000.

28:38.583 --> 28:39.666
150…

28:39.750 --> 28:42.000
And we are willing to do anything

28:42.833 --> 28:44.291
to obtain that cash.

28:44.375 --> 28:45.583
Anything.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.958
-If you know what I mean? Uh-huh.
-Okay, Dr. Prévot, I think he understands.

28:49.958 --> 28:52.208
-To, to, to, to, to, to, to, to.
-That's enough.

28:57.833 --> 28:59.833
God damn, these falafels look good, wow.

28:59.916 --> 29:01.791
Can't even tell there's mushroom inside.

29:02.583 --> 29:03.708
How's it going over there?

29:03.791 --> 29:05.500
Maybe I could finish in a couple hours.

29:06.166 --> 29:09.291
Finish the hole, put the bomb in it. Yeah.

29:10.916 --> 29:11.750
Okay.

29:11.833 --> 29:15.583
Here comes Aure! Aure, oh, oh!

29:15.666 --> 29:17.541
-What's going on?
-And here's oil for Olive!

29:17.625 --> 29:19.625
-Oil for Olive, oh.
-Oh, thanks.

29:19.708 --> 29:21.750
Olive oil! Fuckin' A!

29:22.250 --> 29:24.833
I never made that connection. Crazy.

29:24.916 --> 29:27.916
-It's olive oil.
-Very funny, huh. Are you guys ready?

29:28.500 --> 29:31.500
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe just
a couple more hours and we'll be there.

29:31.583 --> 29:33.708
-Two hours?
-At least, yeah.

29:33.791 --> 29:36.250
What's the deal, that plate
is full of cooked falafels.

29:36.333 --> 29:38.000
We want them warm. Let's go.

29:38.083 --> 29:40.083
Uh, yeah, right, but we still need to cook

29:40.166 --> 29:42.250
the rest, let them set.
It takes longer than you think.

29:42.333 --> 29:44.500
And, oh yeah, we're
making some gourmet food here, so…

29:44.583 --> 29:46.791
But we're not going for fine dining.
What are you saying?

29:46.875 --> 29:49.416
-Léonard is waiting. I'll get him.
-No, no, no, no, no, wait, wait.

29:49.500 --> 29:50.416
-Aure!
-Why wait?

29:50.500 --> 29:53.125
Hold on, we don't even
know if the shrooms work yet.

29:54.333 --> 29:55.208
All right,

29:56.208 --> 29:57.875
so you still don't trust me.

29:57.958 --> 29:59.125
It's not about trust.

29:59.208 --> 30:02.291
I think we need to
try them first before you go get them.

30:02.375 --> 30:03.208
He's right.

30:03.958 --> 30:06.208
All right, that's smart. Try them then.

30:06.291 --> 30:08.541
-We're trying them.
-Yeah, we're gonna try them,

30:08.625 --> 30:10.375
so, go, go and do what you need to do,

30:10.458 --> 30:11.833
-we got it.
-No, no, I'll stay here.

30:11.916 --> 30:13.458
You know the effects, it'll be fun.

30:13.541 --> 30:15.583
-I'm staying.
-Well let's-- Come on, go on, go on.

30:15.666 --> 30:18.333
-So we're trying them?
-We're ready. We have nothing to hide.

30:18.416 --> 30:20.208
-It's for you, Jo. Here, try this.
-All right.

30:20.291 --> 30:21.208
-Taste it.
-L'Chaim.

30:21.291 --> 30:22.291
-L'Chaim.
-L'Chaim.

30:22.375 --> 30:24.875
Come on, it's go time.
Yep, do it.

30:24.958 --> 30:26.666
Mmm.

30:26.750 --> 30:28.416
Oof, geez.

30:28.500 --> 30:31.291
-Tastes really good.
-Mmm.

30:31.375 --> 30:34.750
-Oh, delicious.
-Why are you nibbling like squirrels?

30:34.833 --> 30:36.833
-What?
-You're afraid to get high?

30:36.916 --> 30:38.875
No, we're not,
it's just heavy on the stomach,

30:38.958 --> 30:42.458
diet wise, and I already ate, you know,
so I don't wanna get the farts later.

30:42.541 --> 30:43.916
Who gives a shit if you fart?

30:44.000 --> 30:47.333
Léonard's gonna swallow it whole,
so just eat it. What's with you?

30:47.416 --> 30:49.916
Okay, fine, come on, bro,
let's do it. Down the hatch.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.041
-It's go time, c'mon. One, two, three,
-Do it already.

30:52.125 --> 30:54.166
-Four, five…
-Four, five…

30:54.250 --> 30:56.416
-Whenever you want.
-Are you kidding me?

30:56.500 --> 30:58.791
-We go on seven? Six.
-Yeah, sure, all right. No.

30:58.875 --> 31:00.041
-Seven, c'mon.
-Go!

31:00.125 --> 31:02.291
-Eight, seven, eight, nine.
-Sounds good.

31:02.875 --> 31:04.916
-Oh, fuck! Fucking hell.
-Bro, quit with the bullshit.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.625
-Do it now.
-It's done.

31:07.125 --> 31:09.000
-About time.
-Yeah, it's all good, we did it.

31:09.791 --> 31:12.000
-How's it taste? It's not too…
-Excellent.

31:12.500 --> 31:13.708
It tastes excellent.

31:13.791 --> 31:16.416
See you later, goodbye.
We'll holler at you when we're done.

31:16.500 --> 31:19.791
No, no, no, I'm staying right here.
I'll wait until you swallow it.

31:20.375 --> 31:22.250
Do you think we're faking it, huh?

31:22.333 --> 31:24.375
Looks like you've
still got a lot in there.

31:26.250 --> 31:27.333
Open your pie hole.

31:27.916 --> 31:30.791
-Aah. See, I ate it all.
-Aah.

31:31.375 --> 31:33.333
Perfect. I'll be back after 30 minutes.

31:33.416 --> 31:34.750
-Yeah, sure.
-When it kicks in.

31:34.833 --> 31:37.583
Fucking hell. Fuck! Go drop the
falafels in there. Help me dig the hole.

31:37.666 --> 31:39.750
-We only have 30 minutes.
-Why, bro?

31:39.833 --> 31:40.958
Why?

31:41.041 --> 31:43.333
If the shrooms work, we don't need a bomb.

31:43.416 --> 31:44.416
What if they don't, man?

31:44.916 --> 31:45.791
Okay. Get over here.

31:47.208 --> 31:48.750
Take this knife, help me.

31:51.250 --> 31:52.500
We need to hurry the hell up.

31:53.750 --> 31:54.958
Hot plate coming out.

31:56.541 --> 31:57.875
Hello, La Boule Rouge.

31:59.541 --> 32:00.458
What?

32:02.416 --> 32:03.375
Yes, the Hazans?

32:04.416 --> 32:05.958
One second, okay, please hold.

32:06.041 --> 32:07.166
Wait, please.

32:16.416 --> 32:18.833
-Mr. Gaston, I think it's for you.
-All right, give it here.

32:20.333 --> 32:21.166
Hello?

32:21.833 --> 32:23.125
Yes, who's this?

32:25.083 --> 32:26.625
What? I don't understand.

32:26.708 --> 32:28.333
What became a bottle of shampoo?

32:29.375 --> 32:30.458
With a letter?

32:31.250 --> 32:33.291
Oh, um, all right, fine. So, um, uh…

32:33.916 --> 32:36.083
Please, take a picture.

32:36.583 --> 32:38.666
and send it to me over the mail.

32:39.333 --> 32:40.250
Email.

32:41.291 --> 32:44.000
It's at Enrico...

32:45.041 --> 32:46.875
At, the at sign.

32:48.083 --> 32:49.666
Enrico then dot...

32:50.250 --> 32:51.916
Enrico dot F R.

32:53.875 --> 32:57.083
It's Enrico, as in Enrico Macias, hmar.

32:57.166 --> 32:58.000
Um.

32:58.750 --> 32:59.708
Thank you.

33:00.708 --> 33:02.041
Bye-bye.

33:02.125 --> 33:02.958
Everything okay?

33:03.041 --> 33:06.000
Yeah, something about
a little bottle of shampoo, they said.

33:06.500 --> 33:07.666
with una letter.

33:07.750 --> 33:09.875
I have no idea. I didn't get it.

33:11.041 --> 33:14.666
That'll do it. It's all good.

33:14.750 --> 33:16.625
Uh, all we need to do is to,

33:16.708 --> 33:19.375
uh, put the, the hole
in the, in the tank and, uh, uh,

33:19.458 --> 33:22.083
we're ready, uh.
How's the timer looking?

33:22.583 --> 33:24.625
It's ready now,

33:24.708 --> 33:26.333
-set for ten seconds.
-Yeah.

33:26.416 --> 33:28.875
But, Jo, we need to be super careful,

33:28.958 --> 33:31.458
don't touch it when you
move the tank, okay?

33:32.166 --> 33:34.041
-Okay.
-Okay. The timer?

33:35.375 --> 33:36.250
The timer.

33:36.750 --> 33:37.666
Timer.

33:38.833 --> 33:39.708
Timer.

33:40.375 --> 33:42.875
-Timer, the timer.
-You're on a loop, what's wrong?

33:44.416 --> 33:46.625
-The shrooms are working.
-What?

33:46.708 --> 33:50.250
Ah, ya, ya, ya, ya, ahh.
The shrooms are working, man.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.708
-Oh, fuck, I'm relieved.
-Yeah.

33:53.458 --> 33:55.458
My mind is running wild.

33:55.541 --> 33:59.208
-Wow.
-That's great news.

33:59.291 --> 34:02.041
-We don't need the bomb.
-Yeah, that's right.

34:03.166 --> 34:04.291
Forget about the bomb.

34:05.041 --> 34:06.875
-Forget about the bomb.
-Yep.

34:06.958 --> 34:08.291
Oh, a bombshell.

34:10.125 --> 34:11.000
Aïda,

34:12.416 --> 34:13.750
you're so beautiful.

34:17.958 --> 34:19.291
I'm happy you're here right now.

34:21.291 --> 34:24.166
Ah, fuck. I need to tell you
something really important, okay?

34:24.250 --> 34:25.916
-What?
-First of all, I won't lie.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.791
I was upset when you voted me out,
of the council, with Denis.

34:28.875 --> 34:31.000
That's okay. I love you.

34:34.958 --> 34:36.541
All right, it's been 30 minutes, right?

34:36.625 --> 34:38.375
-Huh? Yeah.
-Oh yeah, at least.

34:38.458 --> 34:39.583
Okay, good, let's go.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.916
I know what I was gonna say.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.583
Haha.

34:44.666 --> 34:48.375
It's about you and the kids.
You're in danger. You need to hide.

34:48.458 --> 34:50.333
Jo, it's no use telling me this,

34:50.416 --> 34:52.166
-because I'm not really here.
-You're not?

34:52.250 --> 34:53.125
You're hallucinating.

34:54.416 --> 34:55.250
So?

34:58.791 --> 35:01.416
Holy shit, it's working.
They're tripping balls.

35:02.666 --> 35:04.833
-So if you really want to save us--
-Yeah?

35:04.916 --> 35:06.125
Then tell me for real, yeah?

35:06.208 --> 35:08.041
Okay. I've got it.

35:09.666 --> 35:12.041
-Oh…
-I mean, just look at them, Dad, look.

35:13.291 --> 35:15.208
But how would I warn you?

35:15.291 --> 35:17.541
-Well, you see the bomb?
-Yeah.

35:17.625 --> 35:19.166
You would need to blow it up.

35:19.250 --> 35:21.833
-Blow it up?
-If you want to send me an email.

35:21.916 --> 35:24.833
Okay. Wait here, gotta tell Ollie.

35:27.250 --> 35:28.208
-Ollie?
-Yeah?

35:28.291 --> 35:29.750
Aïda asked me to set off the bomb.

35:29.833 --> 35:32.000
Bomb!

35:32.500 --> 35:34.833
-Bomb.
-Bitty-bitty-bomb-bomb.

35:34.916 --> 35:36.041
Okay.

35:36.125 --> 35:38.125
-They're kissing, oh, God.
-Why are they kissing?

35:38.208 --> 35:40.416
Oh, they're completely gone.

35:44.333 --> 35:45.916
Just look at his face.

35:46.583 --> 35:49.625
-Okay, it's good, I started the timer.
-It'll blow in ten seconds.

35:49.708 --> 35:50.625
What's gonna blow?

35:51.125 --> 35:52.666
-The bomb!
-The bomb!

35:52.750 --> 35:56.708
Oh no! Oh no!

36:20.625 --> 36:21.833
Fuck, Ollie.

36:23.750 --> 36:25.125
Ah, we made the hole.

36:26.375 --> 36:28.875
-It worked.
-Yes!

36:30.416 --> 36:32.291
Oh, yeah.

36:32.375 --> 36:34.000
-Uh, Jo…
-What?

36:34.708 --> 36:37.500
It's the wrong wall.
We forgot to move the bomb.

36:37.583 --> 36:38.875
Oh, fuck.

36:38.958 --> 36:41.083
-Oh no, this is a fucking disaster.
-Oh, no.

36:41.166 --> 36:45.333
What the hell happened?
Have you both lost your minds?

36:51.083 --> 36:52.375
Oh, fuck!

36:56.166 --> 36:58.041
You guys burned all the mushrooms!

36:58.625 --> 36:59.833
Fuck, look at that.

37:00.333 --> 37:02.041
It's the cat. Look, it's Léonard's cat.

37:03.041 --> 37:05.416
Come here, little kitty. Meow.

37:05.500 --> 37:06.500
Come here.

37:07.583 --> 37:09.291
Don't you recognize your dad?

37:09.958 --> 37:14.291
Why don't you give me
a smooch on my wiener?

37:14.375 --> 37:15.500
All the buds.

37:16.291 --> 37:22.416
That stuff you gave me
was a sledgehammer from heaven.

37:22.500 --> 37:24.500
Jo, Jo step back.

37:24.583 --> 37:27.041
-Jo… step back.
-Huh?

37:27.125 --> 37:28.791
What, you're scared of the cat?

37:28.875 --> 37:32.208
Oh, no, no, no, that's not a cat, Jo.
That's-- that's not a cat.
