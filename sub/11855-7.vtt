WEBVTT

00:08.208 --> 00:11.083
Joan Collins
is not a man in drag.

00:11.166 --> 00:12.291
How do you know?

00:12.375 --> 00:13.709
You believe everything
you hear.

00:13.792 --> 00:16.083
- I do not.
- What don't you believe?

00:16.166 --> 00:20.041
I don't believe Pop Rocks and
Coke makes your stomach
explode.

00:20.125 --> 00:22.458
I don't believe Rock
Hudson
has liver cancer.

00:22.542 --> 00:25.125
Face it, honey,
you're gullible.

00:25.208 --> 00:26.834
And a conspiracy nut.

00:26.917 --> 00:29.000
Sticks and stones..

00:31.625 --> 00:33.083
Who killed Kennedy?

00:35.000 --> 00:38.291
Lyndon Johnson
and Fidel Castro.

00:39.583 --> 00:41.917
'Oh, and Joan Collins.'

00:42.041 --> 00:44.542
'He was the ringleader.'

00:47.625 --> 00:48.709
What?

00:50.208 --> 00:51.458
No, don't come here.

00:51.542 --> 00:53.208
Artie, I'm coming there.

00:54.709 --> 00:56.125
What is it, honey?

00:58.959 --> 01:00.125
I got it.

02:03.875 --> 02:05.125
Ah, Detective Rush?

02:06.083 --> 02:08.375
I'm Artie Russo. I called.

02:08.458 --> 02:10.875
Oh, have a seat.

02:10.959 --> 02:14.458
Scotty?
Artie Russo.

02:16.959 --> 02:18.875
I'm an AIDS survivor.

02:18.959 --> 02:22.375
I was supposed to be
dead 20 years ago.

02:22.458 --> 02:23.375
Lucky, huh.

02:23.458 --> 02:25.375
I got into an early drug trial.

02:25.458 --> 02:28.000
I was, uh, diagnosed
in 1983

02:28.083 --> 02:29.709
given six months.

02:29.792 --> 02:33.458
Instead, my partner Jeff
was dead in six months.

02:33.542 --> 02:34.667
From AIDS?

02:34.750 --> 02:36.500
Murdered in
Rittenhouse Square.

02:36.583 --> 02:37.834
Strangled.

02:37.917 --> 02:39.125
Were there any suspects?

02:39.208 --> 02:41.041
Yeah. Me.

02:41.959 --> 02:42.875
What was the theory?

02:42.959 --> 02:44.041
That I killed the love

02:44.125 --> 02:45.125
of my life in a rage

02:45.208 --> 02:46.166
because he gave me AIDS.

02:46.250 --> 02:48.417
- Did he?
- No one knows.

02:48.500 --> 02:50.083
In '83 there was no test for it.

02:50.166 --> 02:52.041
You found out you had it
by getting sick.

02:52.125 --> 02:54.041
And, Jeff never did?

02:54.125 --> 02:55.542
No.

02:55.625 --> 02:57.333
(Artie)
'The strange thing is'

02:57.417 --> 03:00.083
I accepted my death coming.

03:00.166 --> 03:01.959
It was Jeff who was in a rage.

03:02.041 --> 03:03.625
Over what?

03:03.709 --> 03:06.959
The dying of the light,
as he put it.

03:07.041 --> 03:10.083
He rage against anything
besides the light?

03:10.166 --> 03:13.083
Government, doctors,
the gay community

03:13.166 --> 03:15.250
the newspapers,
the President.

03:15.333 --> 03:16.417
That's a long list.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.917
And 20 years is a long time.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.417
What brings you in now?

03:20.500 --> 03:21.542
I'm getting married

03:21.625 --> 03:23.583
to my partner of ten years.

03:24.875 --> 03:27.500
But before I do

03:27.583 --> 03:31.625
I want to put an end to any
doubt that I loved Jeff.

03:31.709 --> 03:35.125
You want us to re-open
a cold job for your wedding?

03:35.208 --> 03:37.333
It'd be a nice gift.

03:37.417 --> 03:40.041
This ain't Pottery Barn.

03:40.125 --> 03:43.000
The gift I want is justice.

03:43.083 --> 03:44.166
(Lilly)
'We'll read
the job again.'

03:44.250 --> 03:47.667
Maybe um, we'll beat the odds.

03:47.750 --> 03:49.291
Like you did.

03:49.375 --> 03:50.834
Thank you.

04:24.750 --> 04:26.834
When did you first hear?

04:26.917 --> 04:28.917
About AIDS, um..

04:29.000 --> 04:30.125
I guess high school.

04:30.208 --> 04:32.917
I got the talk from
a nun at St. Franny's.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.542
That's something
you don't forget.

04:36.750 --> 04:39.709
Oh, here it is.
Kern, Jeffrey.

04:39.792 --> 04:41.709
When brother Donnelly
died of it..

04:42.625 --> 04:44.333
...it really hit home.

04:45.875 --> 04:48.834
Jeff was 25 in 1983.

04:48.917 --> 04:50.333
Unlucky timing for a gay man.

04:50.417 --> 04:53.083
No warning
what was out there.

04:53.166 --> 04:55.083
Take it upstairs?

04:59.959 --> 05:01.875
Hit with a rock, strangled.

05:01.959 --> 05:03.625
From the front.
Bare hands.

05:03.709 --> 05:04.875
Sounds personal.

05:04.959 --> 05:06.041
No robbery, either.

05:06.125 --> 05:08.041
Lab didn't get
much
blood to test.

05:08.125 --> 05:09.875
Maybe they were scared
to collect it.

05:09.959 --> 05:11.709
Guys on the scene
knew he was gay?

05:11.792 --> 05:12.959
Earring in his right ear.

05:13.041 --> 05:14.875
You know, lot of unknowns
about AIDS in '83.

05:14.959 --> 05:16.125
Nicky's probably right.

05:16.208 --> 05:17.417
All we have are
a few blood
stains

05:17.500 --> 05:18.542
on Jeff's shirt.

05:18.625 --> 05:19.834
Never analyzed.

05:19.917 --> 05:21.083
Well, the lab will know
how to deal with it now

05:21.166 --> 05:22.542
if your victim fought back.

05:22.625 --> 05:23.875
Might be the killer's blood.

05:23.959 --> 05:25.291
Anything else to go on?

05:25.375 --> 05:27.709
You ever hear of the
Benjamin Kern Foundation?

05:27.792 --> 05:31.500
I heard of the Kern Building.
Cool. Big fountain out front.

05:31.583 --> 05:33.417
This is Jeffrey Kern.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.917
The victim was rich.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.333
Might be significant.

05:36.417 --> 05:38.208
Who stood to gain
from Jeff dying?

05:38.291 --> 05:39.458
You got any siblings, Scotty?

05:39.542 --> 05:41.500
Ah, yeah, a brother.

05:41.583 --> 05:42.875
Oh, you got that

05:42.959 --> 05:44.417
and you got the blood.

05:44.500 --> 05:46.333
So where's that cool building?

05:48.333 --> 05:50.041
(Lilly)
'Is your dad able to join
us?'

05:50.125 --> 05:53.041
He's able, but unwilling.

05:53.125 --> 05:54.375
Got a lot of art.

05:54.458 --> 05:55.917
Beats our wanted posters.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.417
I'd like a wanted poster
with my brother's killer on
it.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.583
Never bought Artie as the doer?

06:02.667 --> 06:04.250
No.

06:04.333 --> 06:06.333
And I don't think the
cops
knocked themselves out

06:06.417 --> 06:09.417
trying to find the killer
of this low-status, gay kid.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.250
His family was high status.

06:11.333 --> 06:12.250
'Fear of AIDS'

06:12.333 --> 06:14.208
trumped everything in '83.

06:14.291 --> 06:15.917
'The paramedics
left Jeff's body'

06:16.041 --> 06:17.542
in the rain for three hours

06:17.625 --> 06:19.375
'cause they didn't
want to touch him.

06:19.458 --> 06:21.166
Jeff being from
this flush family

06:21.250 --> 06:23.709
kind of makes us look
at money as motive.

06:23.792 --> 06:25.125
He didn't have any money.

06:25.208 --> 06:28.000
My dad disinherited him
a year before he died.

06:28.083 --> 06:29.875
Because he was gay?

06:29.959 --> 06:31.250
Dad couldn't accept it.

06:31.333 --> 06:32.500
(Scotty)
'So Jeff being cut off'

06:32.583 --> 06:34.667
then dying left you sole heir

06:34.750 --> 06:36.333
to the family fortune.

06:36.417 --> 06:38.041
I didn't profit from his death.

06:38.125 --> 06:39.291
His half of all that money?

06:39.375 --> 06:40.959
Goes to three charities.

06:41.041 --> 06:44.000
I convinced my
dad
to do that much.

06:44.083 --> 06:45.500
You were close
to your brother?

06:45.583 --> 06:47.458
He made me crazy

06:47.542 --> 06:51.208
but he was the kind of
guy
you just love anyway.

06:51.291 --> 06:53.500
'My dad adored
him too.'

06:53.583 --> 06:58.000
But their relationship
ended at my engagement party.

06:59.875 --> 07:02.792
- You came.
- I wouldn't miss it.

07:02.875 --> 07:05.000
You're brave.

07:08.291 --> 07:09.917
Look who's here.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.291
I'm so glad.

07:11.375 --> 07:13.291
Congratulations, Ellen.

07:13.375 --> 07:15.583
- 'Where is he?'
- Walking over here.

07:23.583 --> 07:25.000
Do you have
to do this,
Jeffrey?

07:25.083 --> 07:26.792
There's the perfect
Kern manners.

07:26.875 --> 07:28.333
Are you making
some kind of
point?

07:28.417 --> 07:29.750
I'm attending a family event

07:29.834 --> 07:31.917
with Artie who's part
of my family.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.625
Nice to see you again.

07:34.709 --> 07:36.333
If you want to
flaunt
your lifestyle

07:36.417 --> 07:37.959
there's a time, a place.

07:38.041 --> 07:40.000
- When? Where?
- Not at Paul's party.

07:40.083 --> 07:41.917
We don't mind.

07:44.083 --> 07:48.166
I don't want this for you.

07:48.250 --> 07:49.667
If Artie can't stay,
I can't either.

08:01.250 --> 08:04.709
Congratulations. I
know
you'll have a happy
life.

08:16.291 --> 08:19.333
After that, my dad acted
like he only had one son.

08:19.417 --> 08:21.000
So what'd Jeff do for money?

08:21.083 --> 08:23.583
Worked as a towel boy
at a bathhouse.

08:23.667 --> 08:25.250
To really stick it to Dad.

08:25.333 --> 08:26.583
Didn't last too long, though.

08:26.667 --> 08:28.625
- What happened?
- There was some trouble
there.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.917
I...I never knew
the whole story.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.709
Would Artie know the details?

08:32.792 --> 08:34.458
Yeah, probably.

08:36.667 --> 08:39.417
Jeff was supposed to be passing
out towels in that place

08:39.500 --> 08:43.041
instead, he was, uh,
posting warning signs.

08:43.125 --> 08:44.333
About AIDS?

08:44.417 --> 08:46.000
Well that must've gone
over big with the owner.

08:47.625 --> 08:49.208
Artie, they need an answer.

08:49.291 --> 08:51.250
The white chair covers
or the light blue?

08:51.333 --> 08:52.875
Uh, this is Russ.

08:53.875 --> 08:55.083
What do you think?

08:57.166 --> 08:59.750
White goes with a wedding.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.291
I like white, too.

09:04.542 --> 09:08.125
So was Jeff trying
to shut this bathhouse down?

09:08.208 --> 09:09.125
Basically.

09:09.208 --> 09:10.458
He have any success?

09:10.542 --> 09:12.458
The fire was pretty effective.

09:12.542 --> 09:13.959
What he burned the place?

09:14.041 --> 09:16.542
He never admitted it, but..

09:25.709 --> 09:27.709
- You could have killed
people.
- You're killing people.

09:27.792 --> 09:29.125
This place is a
hotbed
of disease.

09:29.208 --> 09:30.709
No one knows how it's spread.

09:30.792 --> 09:33.041
Whoever set this fire
did a public service.

09:33.125 --> 09:34.667
"Whoever", I like that.

09:34.750 --> 09:37.625
- Jeff, what's going on?
- This is my boss, Barney.

09:37.709 --> 09:40.417
- Who has no conscience.
- Let's go home, calm down.

09:40.500 --> 09:41.959
Hey, hey, hey, Jeff.

09:42.041 --> 09:43.125
How are we going to
take
care of this, huh?

09:43.208 --> 09:44.875
I didn't do anything.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.917
- I'll have you locked up.
- Hey, let's be reasonable.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.500
Reasonable is you reaching

09:48.583 --> 09:51.125
into your dad's deep pockets
and compensating me.

09:51.208 --> 09:53.834
I don't have a dad anymore.

09:53.917 --> 09:55.500
- You seem rational.
- I am.

09:55.583 --> 09:57.875
Why don't you talk
to your lunatic boyfriend

09:57.959 --> 10:00.834
and stop him,
or I will!

10:04.500 --> 10:07.041
(Lilly)
'You ever see Barney
again after that?'

10:07.125 --> 10:10.208
I only hoped he was content
with just firing Jeff

10:10.291 --> 10:12.625
'cause there wasn't
any money to give
him.

10:12.709 --> 10:15.500
You float the Barney theory
with detectives in '83?

10:15.583 --> 10:18.000
Gave 'em his name.

10:18.083 --> 10:19.333
Never heard back.

10:22.750 --> 10:25.917
(Barney)
'It was a terrible time.
Terrible.'

10:26.041 --> 10:29.375
(Scotty)
'Okay, but through
all the terribleness'

10:29.458 --> 10:30.667
you were raking it in.

10:30.750 --> 10:33.208
Bathhouses were hot in the '80s.

10:33.291 --> 10:35.083
No one knew what
was coming down the pike.

10:35.166 --> 10:37.208
And you made
a couple mill a year.

10:37.291 --> 10:39.375
[scoffs]
So you did your research.

10:39.458 --> 10:42.041
(Scotty)
'And here comes
this towel boy Jeff'

10:42.125 --> 10:43.375
decides to save the world

10:43.458 --> 10:45.083
by shutting down
your
booming business.

10:45.166 --> 10:47.500
It was the turning point,
anyway.

10:47.583 --> 10:49.542
Virus was making
the papers.

10:49.625 --> 10:51.709
AIDS shut down my bathhouse.

10:51.792 --> 10:53.333
But Jeff lit the match.

10:53.417 --> 10:56.375
- Kid was a hothead.
- You a hothead too?

10:56.458 --> 10:58.083
I can be.

10:58.166 --> 10:59.959
The insurance paid
for all my losses.

11:00.041 --> 11:02.000
And Jeff got out
of my sight for good.

11:02.083 --> 11:05.583
This Jeff sounds like he pissed
off every other person he met.

11:05.667 --> 11:06.625
Roughly.

11:06.709 --> 11:07.875
Anyone else around that place

11:08.000 --> 11:09.834
get into it with Jeff?

11:09.917 --> 11:13.208
There was someone
Jeff targeted in particular.

11:24.125 --> 11:25.250
Carlo, we got to talk.

11:25.333 --> 11:27.250
- Talk? No thanks.
- Five minutes.

11:27.333 --> 11:30.208
[chuckles]
I thought you said
you just wanted to
talk.

11:32.208 --> 11:33.834
All that time you spend
in front of the mirror

11:33.917 --> 11:36.250
I know you've noticed this.

11:36.333 --> 11:38.375
- It's nothing.
- You're sick.

11:38.458 --> 11:39.333
I'm fine.

11:39.417 --> 11:40.667
Did you tell that guy

11:40.750 --> 11:42.250
you just had sex with
that you have it?

11:42.333 --> 11:43.375
[chuckles]
It's cancer

11:43.458 --> 11:45.291
and cancer's not contagious.

11:45.375 --> 11:47.583
You're purposely
giving it to people?

11:47.667 --> 11:50.041
- You're such a drama queen.
- What are you, a sociopath?

11:50.125 --> 11:55.625
I think you're still upset
that we stopped. You and
me.

11:55.709 --> 11:59.625
Carlo, it kills people.

11:59.709 --> 12:01.583
Stay out of my way

12:01.667 --> 12:03.917
and I'll stay out of yours.

12:12.125 --> 12:14.625
Now, Carlo was the prettiest
of them all.

12:14.709 --> 12:16.959
'Literally got by
on his good looks.'

12:17.041 --> 12:20.250
Ah, I thought I saved this.

12:22.709 --> 12:24.792
Jeff made these.

12:24.875 --> 12:27.208
Handed them out
around Queens
Village.

12:29.041 --> 12:30.458
I'm seeing a motive.

12:41.083 --> 12:43.083
"Carlo is
spreading
the gay cancer

12:43.166 --> 12:46.208
to ten men a
night
at Barney's."

12:46.291 --> 12:47.333
Ten a night?

12:47.417 --> 12:50.000
At that pace,
Carlo must be long
dead.

12:50.083 --> 12:51.667
Need a last name
to find out.

12:51.750 --> 12:53.458
Barney didn't know it?

12:53.542 --> 12:56.542
Now, this Carlo said some
about when "we stopped."

12:56.625 --> 12:58.834
It sounded like him
and Jeff were together.

12:58.917 --> 13:00.208
Did Artie know that?

13:00.291 --> 13:02.959
And did Artie get
the bug from Jeff, who..

13:03.041 --> 13:04.417
...got it from Carlo?

13:04.500 --> 13:06.500
Sounds like the cops in '83
were on to something.

13:06.583 --> 13:08.542
Better go back
to the bride-to-be.

13:08.625 --> 13:12.125
No, I think, technically,
they're both grooms.

13:14.917 --> 13:17.083
I knew about
Jeff and Carlo.

13:17.166 --> 13:20.959
- And you didn't mind?
- I didn't like it.

13:21.041 --> 13:22.166
But?

13:22.250 --> 13:23.458
You're not gonna find
this palatable.

13:23.542 --> 13:26.083
Consider me warned.

13:26.166 --> 13:27.375
Most gay men
were living out

13:27.458 --> 13:29.458
what a lot
of straight men
fantasize.

13:29.542 --> 13:30.542
Which is?

13:30.625 --> 13:32.709
Spouse at home,
affairs on the
side.

13:32.792 --> 13:34.250
That was our arrangement, too.

13:35.792 --> 13:38.208
Until I got sick.

13:50.625 --> 13:52.208
How is he?

13:52.291 --> 13:53.959
He's the same.

13:55.375 --> 13:58.291
He's very brave.

13:58.375 --> 14:01.083
He's sleeping. If you could
keep
your voices down.

14:01.166 --> 14:02.792
Sure.

14:04.333 --> 14:06.875
- Hey, Artie.
- Is it my birthday?

14:06.959 --> 14:10.000
It's a metaphor.
Every day is a celebration.

14:10.083 --> 14:13.125
Every day's gonna be
my birthday from now on?

14:13.208 --> 14:15.166
Yes.

14:15.250 --> 14:18.583
We'll be in a never-ending
production of "Our Town"

14:18.667 --> 14:22.875
treasuring every single
moment as we live it.

14:22.959 --> 14:24.750
That's right.

14:28.375 --> 14:29.750
Don't do that.

14:29.834 --> 14:31.875
Stay back.
Don't get
this.

14:36.291 --> 14:38.417
I saw Carlo today.

14:38.500 --> 14:41.500
How is the Adonis
of Queens Village?

14:41.583 --> 14:44.625
He can't believe I
only
want to be with you.

14:44.709 --> 14:46.917
Neither can I.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.750
Well, it's true.

14:54.542 --> 14:57.875
Jeff left Carlo for me.

14:57.959 --> 14:59.583
Who would've thought?

14:59.667 --> 15:02.166
Carlo getting dumped,
that must've been new to him.

15:02.250 --> 15:03.750
[scoff]
Brand-new.

15:03.834 --> 15:05.959
You think he was dangerous?

15:06.041 --> 15:10.500
I think he purposely infected
hundreds of men in this city.

15:10.583 --> 15:12.291
That's murder, isn't it?

15:14.041 --> 15:16.542
You know his last name?

15:16.625 --> 15:18.166
Fishman.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.875
First name is Melvin.

15:19.959 --> 15:22.458
Carlo is
Melvin Fishman?

15:22.542 --> 15:24.667
He's an Ohio boy.

15:24.750 --> 15:27.625
Reinvented himself when
he moved to the big
city.

15:27.709 --> 15:29.125
He alive?

15:29.208 --> 15:32.333
Try South Philly.

15:32.417 --> 15:33.667
Now, how's a guy
like him make it

15:33.750 --> 15:37.417
when so many others don't?

15:37.500 --> 15:41.250
If God was punishing
people for their sins

15:41.333 --> 15:44.125
he had a badly researched list.

15:52.917 --> 15:56.291
I was Melvin for 18
miserable
years in Shaker Heights.

15:56.375 --> 15:59.000
Here...I'm Carlo.

15:59.083 --> 16:02.166
Here, hold Louise.

16:02.250 --> 16:04.375
(Nick)
'Let's talk about
this homicide.'

16:04.458 --> 16:08.083
You want to know
if I murdered Jeff Kern? No.

16:08.166 --> 16:12.041
You had a reputation for
playing
roulette with people's health.

16:12.125 --> 16:15.709
This just put me more in demand.

16:15.792 --> 16:20.000
I'm ugly now, and make
money cleaning bird
cages

16:20.083 --> 16:22.250
but look at me there.

16:22.333 --> 16:24.000
I was gorgeous.

16:24.083 --> 16:27.458
Nobody cared about
the "he'll kill you" part?

16:27.542 --> 16:29.041
Jeff was seen as a hysteric

16:29.125 --> 16:31.750
like the lady who smashed up
liquor bottles with an axe.

16:31.834 --> 16:32.959
People laughed.

16:33.041 --> 16:34.542
So guys still wanted you?

16:34.625 --> 16:37.000
Jeff was the one who
ended up ostracized.

16:37.083 --> 16:40.166
Even though he was
right in the end.

16:40.250 --> 16:43.625
People don't know
how to act in an emergency.

16:43.709 --> 16:45.875
When AIDS hit the world..

16:45.959 --> 16:48.166
...most of us
froze
in disbelief.

16:48.250 --> 16:51.834
- Not Jeff.
- No, he fought.

16:51.917 --> 16:54.750
In ways a lot more
stupid than this.

16:54.834 --> 16:56.667
Like?

16:56.750 --> 16:58.750
Jeff usually hid
his background.

16:58.834 --> 17:00.750
Now he decided to use it.

17:00.834 --> 17:01.667
How?

17:01.750 --> 17:03.208
A fundraising party

17:03.291 --> 17:05.583
for rich, closeted gay men

17:05.667 --> 17:07.750
who wanted to stay that way.

17:14.125 --> 17:16.750
Be sure not to
set off the alarm.

17:16.834 --> 17:18.333
Thanks for
helping
me do this.

17:18.417 --> 17:21.750
- Don't tell dad.
- Are you kidding?

17:21.834 --> 17:23.000
You should call him.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.625
He should call me.

17:27.542 --> 17:29.959
I'll be in the guest house.

17:40.083 --> 17:43.291
Thirty-seven men have died
in Philadelphia

17:43.375 --> 17:45.875
425 in New York

17:45.959 --> 17:47.458
and the government
is ignoring it.

17:47.542 --> 17:50.375
Ronald Reagan?
Interfere with God's work?

17:50.458 --> 17:52.500
Everyone in this room
has money and clout

17:52.583 --> 17:55.083
so we're the ones
who have to do something.

17:55.166 --> 17:57.166
We could hire a lobbyist.

17:57.250 --> 17:58.250
A doctor, maybe.

17:58.333 --> 17:59.834
Giving money isn't enough.

17:59.917 --> 18:02.583
We have to put ourselves
on the line.

18:02.667 --> 18:05.458
- How do you mean?
- Come out.

18:05.542 --> 18:06.542
Make a joint statement.

18:06.625 --> 18:07.917
We're gay, we're powerful

18:08.000 --> 18:09.500
'and attention
must be paid.'

18:09.583 --> 18:12.333
[chuckles]
Your father would love that.

18:12.417 --> 18:14.542
My father will have
to handle it.

18:14.625 --> 18:15.959
If we came out

18:16.041 --> 18:18.917
we'd lose whatever
credibility we might have
had.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.709
People are dying.
This is a crisis.

18:21.792 --> 18:23.333
Don't be an alarmist.

18:23.417 --> 18:26.625
There's no cure. No one's
even looking for a cure.

18:28.875 --> 18:32.083
This is a press release,
from everyone in this room.

18:32.166 --> 18:33.417
Are you crazy?

18:33.500 --> 18:35.667
I'm sending it out in a week.

18:35.750 --> 18:38.000
'I'd like your signatures'

18:38.083 --> 18:39.667
but I don't need them.

18:47.458 --> 18:49.417
Jeff was gonna break
the biggest taboo

18:49.500 --> 18:50.750
in the gay world.

18:50.834 --> 18:51.709
Outing.

18:51.792 --> 18:53.125
He had more guts
than brains

18:53.208 --> 18:54.709
threatening those men.

18:54.792 --> 18:57.542
So, who were these guys
who had everything to lose?

18:57.625 --> 18:59.125
You want me to out them?

18:59.208 --> 19:00.750
(Nick)
'For a homicide
investigation?'

19:00.834 --> 19:02.417
You bet.

19:04.291 --> 19:06.041
Screw 'em.

19:06.125 --> 19:08.667
What've they done for me lately?

19:08.750 --> 19:10.208
Right, Bobo?

19:12.458 --> 19:15.000
Got a pen?

19:15.083 --> 19:16.709
(Nick)
'Terrence Overton'

19:16.792 --> 19:18.500
president of East Line Bank.

19:18.583 --> 19:21.709
Christopher Duncan, chief
of staff to councilman byers.

19:21.792 --> 19:24.083
Byers. He's right
of Attila the Hun.

19:24.166 --> 19:25.542
Don't ask, don't tell.

19:25.625 --> 19:26.917
Just hide in the log cabin.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.667
Chief of emergency medicine
at Penn General.

19:29.750 --> 19:31.375
Russell Bennet.

19:31.458 --> 19:32.792
Who's that?

19:34.792 --> 19:36.000
Russ.

19:36.875 --> 19:38.667
That's Artie's fiance.

19:44.250 --> 19:48.458
You were at Jeff's party
the week before he was murdered.

19:48.542 --> 19:51.625
- Yes.
- This is unbelievable.

19:51.709 --> 19:54.250
A lot of people in that
room
had motive to kill Jeff.

19:54.333 --> 19:57.083
Not me. I've been out
since I was 16.

19:57.166 --> 19:58.583
How could you not tell me this?

19:58.667 --> 20:01.208
[sighs]
It's a time of my life
I'm embarrassed about.

20:01.291 --> 20:04.333
I was a drunk and an addict
who dated older men.

20:04.417 --> 20:05.583
I was there with one.

20:05.667 --> 20:08.291
He have a lot to
lose
by being outed?

20:08.375 --> 20:10.125
Only everything.

20:10.208 --> 20:12.375
Who we talking about, Russ?

20:13.333 --> 20:14.417
You better tell them.

20:14.500 --> 20:16.458
You better tell
them
every detail.

20:16.542 --> 20:17.917
I will.

20:19.542 --> 20:20.834
So?

20:21.792 --> 20:24.125
[sighs]
Carson Finch.

20:24.208 --> 20:27.041
Oh, this just
gets worse and worse.

20:27.125 --> 20:28.333
(Scotty)
'Who's that?'

20:28.417 --> 20:29.959
A conservative columnist
for the Times.

20:30.041 --> 20:32.208
It'd be like finding
out
Pat Buchanan was gay.

20:32.291 --> 20:33.792
If I'd been sober
for five minutes

20:33.875 --> 20:36.625
while I was with him, I might
have realized he was the
devil.

20:36.709 --> 20:39.583
You think Finch
could have hurt
Jeff?

20:39.667 --> 20:42.166
I know he read him
the riot act after the party.

20:45.375 --> 20:47.125
Things don't get done

20:47.208 --> 20:49.917
when you rant and rave
and threaten.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.792
Things get done
quietly.

20:51.875 --> 20:54.500
We'll be dead.
That's quiet.

20:56.583 --> 20:58.083
Russell, I need five minutes.

21:02.125 --> 21:05.125
- Lovely family.
- They're okay.

21:05.208 --> 21:07.208
Powerful, too.

21:07.291 --> 21:08.542
I've never
met
your father

21:08.625 --> 21:11.000
but I see his
name
everywhere..

21:11.083 --> 21:13.667
...hospitals, libraries.

21:13.750 --> 21:16.041
He's a major
donor
in Philadelphia.

21:16.125 --> 21:18.166
I know all that.

21:18.250 --> 21:19.750
You had some people
here tonight

21:19.834 --> 21:23.834
who could bring
his empire crashing
down.

21:23.917 --> 21:25.750
Now you're the one threatening.

21:25.834 --> 21:27.875
Just saying.

21:27.959 --> 21:31.834
Even the picturesque
Kern family has dirty
secrets.

21:32.917 --> 21:36.458
I grew up here.
I know hardball.

21:39.333 --> 21:40.875
You don't..

21:40.959 --> 21:42.333
...want to play it..

21:42.417 --> 21:43.959
...with me.

21:52.625 --> 21:54.417
Satan himself.

21:54.500 --> 21:56.542
How far would Finch go?

21:56.625 --> 21:59.041
I thought he was content
eviscerating people in print

21:59.125 --> 22:00.792
but who knows?

22:09.875 --> 22:11.542
So is the wedding off?

22:11.625 --> 22:13.583
That's between them.

22:13.667 --> 22:15.792
Mine was honored off
three times.

22:15.875 --> 22:17.542
New police resource.

22:17.625 --> 22:19.166
Yeah? What?

22:19.250 --> 22:23.750
Half the guys on the party
list
are now on the AIDS quilt.

22:23.834 --> 22:25.375
(Scotty)
'Gone, huh?'

22:25.458 --> 22:26.417
Yeah.

22:26.500 --> 22:29.500
Ain't all
Mary's.
Women, kids.

22:29.583 --> 22:33.750
IV drug users, and my niece
being one of 'em.

22:35.166 --> 22:36.291
Hmm.

22:36.375 --> 22:38.083
(Will)
'Two panels for Jeff Kern.'

22:38.166 --> 22:41.166
One from Artie,
one from his brother.

22:43.291 --> 22:44.792
(Lilly)
'Guess where Finch lives?'

22:46.166 --> 22:47.625
Rittenhouse Square.

22:47.709 --> 22:49.166
Near where Jeff ended up.

22:52.834 --> 22:53.917
Jeff Kern was lucky

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
he lived through
the night of that party.

22:57.083 --> 22:58.417
Highball?

22:58.500 --> 23:00.792
We heard about the threats,
especially from you.

23:00.875 --> 23:02.333
I just warned him.

23:02.417 --> 23:04.250
You hurt me,
I'll hurt you.

23:04.333 --> 23:06.959
Like maybe with a rock
to the face?

23:07.041 --> 23:09.542
- That wasn't necessary.
- Why's that?

23:09.625 --> 23:12.166
Between my friend
at the East Line Bank and I

23:12.250 --> 23:15.625
we had plenty of dirt
on the magnificent Kern
family.

23:15.709 --> 23:17.542
And that made Jeff back off?

23:17.625 --> 23:19.959
'Cause he doesn't seem
to be the backing off type.

23:20.041 --> 23:22.291
Who knows what
he would have done.

23:22.375 --> 23:24.458
Maybe he died
before he knew himself.

23:24.542 --> 23:26.458
Or maybe he died
so he couldn't put
out

23:26.542 --> 23:28.125
that press release.

23:28.208 --> 23:30.000
Maybe.

23:33.125 --> 23:38.125
But I fight
with words, not rocks.

23:38.208 --> 23:39.667
For what it's worth

23:39.750 --> 23:43.417
I never believed that Jeff
died at the hands of a gay
man.

23:43.500 --> 23:46.208
Beating him with a rock?

23:46.291 --> 23:48.208
I'd look for a heterosexual.

23:48.291 --> 23:50.917
Got one in particular?

23:51.000 --> 23:53.375
Jeff found out I was gay
because we both had friends

23:53.458 --> 23:55.792
on the AIDS floor
at Penn General.

23:55.875 --> 23:57.917
I saw him there.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.291
Yeah, so?

23:59.375 --> 24:01.792
Artie shared a room
with a boy who had AIDS.

24:01.875 --> 24:04.834
The boy's father was..

24:04.917 --> 24:06.291
...rageful.

24:11.208 --> 24:13.500
Carson Finch?

24:13.583 --> 24:15.583
Jeff? Hello.

24:15.667 --> 24:16.792
Hi.

24:16.875 --> 24:18.041
Sick friend?

24:28.458 --> 24:30.000
Can I get you anything?

24:30.083 --> 24:31.750
Food?

24:31.834 --> 24:33.834
You can get me a cure.

24:33.917 --> 24:35.125
I know.

24:35.208 --> 24:36.458
He's dying.

24:40.583 --> 24:42.375
I'm sorry.

24:42.458 --> 24:44.375
Take your hand off me.

24:44.458 --> 24:46.542
Kenny got sick
because of people like
you.

24:46.625 --> 24:48.625
- Excuse me?
- He is innocent.

24:48.709 --> 24:50.709
He should be helped
before your friend.

24:50.792 --> 24:53.542
I like to help everyone.

24:53.625 --> 24:55.875
He's eight. Please.

24:58.125 --> 25:00.917
I don't know
if I can help Artie.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.834
Damn you!

25:05.583 --> 25:06.792
(Scotty)
'What happened?'

25:06.875 --> 25:08.417
Jeff walked away.

25:08.500 --> 25:11.583
Now, how did this guy
think
Jeff could help his son?

25:11.667 --> 25:13.333
I don't know.

25:13.417 --> 25:15.375
'But he knew where
to find Jeff.'

25:16.709 --> 25:19.000
And I know hate when I see it.

25:28.083 --> 25:29.542
We gotta talk to you
about Jeff Kern

25:29.625 --> 25:31.625
'the guy you fought with
at the hospital.'

25:31.709 --> 25:34.000
I don't remember half of what
came out of my mouth that
night.

25:34.083 --> 25:38.041
- You threatened him.
- Two weeks later he was
killed.

25:38.125 --> 25:40.083
Not by me.

25:40.166 --> 25:41.542
I was angry, yeah.

25:41.625 --> 25:44.667
I thought Kenny got AIDS
from his second-grade teacher.

25:44.750 --> 25:46.625
Now I know it was
the transfusions he had..

25:46.709 --> 25:48.125
...skateboard accident.

25:48.208 --> 25:51.333
Why'd you target Jeff?

25:51.417 --> 25:53.709
It just seemed unfair.

25:53.792 --> 25:56.125
I mean, if there
was some miracle

25:56.208 --> 25:58.625
my kid should get it,
not the gay guy.

25:58.709 --> 26:01.417
What miracle do you mean?

26:01.500 --> 26:03.625
That guy, Jeff,
said he had a way

26:03.709 --> 26:05.667
to get his boyfriend
into a drug trial.

26:05.750 --> 26:07.583
- Maybe save him.
- How?

26:07.667 --> 26:10.291
I don't know, but, uh...they
kept arguing about it

26:10.375 --> 26:13.792
the sick guy saying "It's not
worth it. I accept my death."

26:13.875 --> 26:17.000
I'm thinkin', "You accept
your death? Great!"

26:17.083 --> 26:18.917
Give my kid the drug.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.834
How do you get access
to these drug trials?

26:21.917 --> 26:23.375
Connections, clout.

26:23.458 --> 26:26.166
Know a board member be a
major donor to the
hospital.

26:26.250 --> 26:27.917
What hospital you talking about?

26:28.000 --> 26:29.500
Penn General.

26:29.583 --> 26:31.083
They do a lot of research there.

26:32.500 --> 26:34.667
Jeff's father is on
the board of
directors

26:34.750 --> 26:36.083
for Pennsylvania General.

26:36.166 --> 26:38.333
Oh, that qualifies
as a major donor.

26:38.417 --> 26:39.709
Has been for years.

26:39.792 --> 26:41.333
So Jeff needs Dad to save

26:41.417 --> 26:43.166
Artie's life, potentially.

26:43.250 --> 26:44.875
Only Jeff and Dad are estranged.

26:44.959 --> 26:47.417
But Jeff will do anything.
He and Artie are in love.

26:47.500 --> 26:49.333
Which is why dad will say no.

26:49.417 --> 26:50.959
(Scotty)
'That writer, Finch'

26:51.041 --> 26:53.333
told Jeff he had something
that could ruin his dad.

26:53.417 --> 26:55.417
Maybe Jeff asked him
what the dirt was

26:55.500 --> 26:57.333
so he could
throw it at dad himself.

26:57.417 --> 27:00.000
We gotta talk to the old man,
whether he likes it or not.

27:00.083 --> 27:01.959
Do you think
a father would kill his son

27:02.041 --> 27:03.709
to save his business empire?

27:03.792 --> 27:05.542
(Lilly)
'Why not?'

27:05.625 --> 27:08.083
Jeff was dead to him already.

27:24.250 --> 27:27.041
Did Jeff come to you for help
before he died, Mr. Kern?

27:27.125 --> 27:29.041
He called.

27:29.125 --> 27:31.208
Asked if we could meet.

27:31.291 --> 27:33.291
Said it was important.

27:33.375 --> 27:35.959
I made him beg.

27:36.041 --> 27:37.125
I was a jerk.

27:37.208 --> 27:38.291
Dad, don't say that.

27:38.375 --> 27:41.250
[chuckles]
Sorry it offends you.

27:41.333 --> 27:43.291
Well, what happened
when you two met?

27:43.375 --> 27:44.834
We didn't.

27:44.917 --> 27:47.041
He was murdered
the night
before.

27:47.125 --> 27:49.667
So you don't know
what he wanted to talk about?

27:49.750 --> 27:51.667
No, and I never will.

27:51.750 --> 27:54.417
I think Jeff wanted you to
help
Artie get into the drug trial

27:54.500 --> 27:55.417
'at Penn General.'

27:55.500 --> 27:58.834
Yes. You've told me.

27:58.917 --> 28:00.000
What would you have said?

28:00.083 --> 28:01.917
I would have said no.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.250
But Artie got
into that trial.

28:04.333 --> 28:05.917
Yes.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.333
After Jeff died, I made sure

28:08.417 --> 28:10.792
'his "friend"'

28:10.875 --> 28:13.458
got a place.

28:13.542 --> 28:14.583
Strange logic.

28:14.667 --> 28:16.125
Well, maybe it was guilt

28:16.208 --> 28:18.458
for something
you did, Mr.
Kern?

28:18.542 --> 28:21.959
You have something
to say to me, say
it.

28:22.041 --> 28:24.583
Be a man.

28:24.667 --> 28:27.041
Carson Finch had dirt
on your family.

28:27.125 --> 28:28.667
Finch is a dilettante.

28:28.750 --> 28:31.250
Jeff knew what it was, and
was gonna use it against you.

28:31.333 --> 28:33.917
You've got fire, huh?

28:34.000 --> 28:37.959
[chuckles]
Just like Jeff
did.

28:38.041 --> 28:41.291
What did Finch tell him?
What did he hold over you?

28:41.375 --> 28:46.166
Oh, what could be worse than
what Jeffrey flaunted every
day?

28:46.250 --> 28:47.709
- Dad.
- It was unnatural.

28:47.792 --> 28:48.792
Let's not go into that.

28:48.875 --> 28:51.083
Only thing more unnatural

28:51.166 --> 28:53.792
is for a father to bury his son.

28:56.333 --> 29:00.875
Hearing of his death
was the worst day of my life.

29:03.041 --> 29:06.583
- You should go now.
- Yes, go.

29:06.667 --> 29:08.250
You getting Artie
into that trial

29:08.333 --> 29:10.583
'may have saved his life.'

29:10.667 --> 29:12.875
Furthest thing from my mind.

29:12.959 --> 29:15.834
I don't believe you, Mr. Kern.

29:15.917 --> 29:17.625
I think you loved Jeff.

29:19.250 --> 29:21.667
Well..

29:23.041 --> 29:25.208
He was always my favorite.

29:27.667 --> 29:29.917
They both are.

29:33.625 --> 29:36.166
You really think Jeff
would blackmail his own
father?

29:36.250 --> 29:38.458
He wasn't shy
about confrontation.

29:38.542 --> 29:41.000
I suppose that's true.
He was a chip off the old
block.

29:41.083 --> 29:42.667
You told him you had
something on his family.

29:42.750 --> 29:45.750
- We need to know what it was.
- That's water under the
bridge.

29:45.834 --> 29:47.083
(Scotty)
'Something
on the foundation?'

29:47.166 --> 29:50.125
- Financial scandal?
- Or personal?

29:52.458 --> 29:54.291
I believe in discretion.

29:54.375 --> 29:57.542
- A man was murdered.
- Bludgeoned, strangled.

29:57.625 --> 29:59.875
(Scotty)
'That ain't discreet.'

29:59.959 --> 30:02.166
Do right by this kid, Finch.

30:16.875 --> 30:18.500
Summer of '78.

30:18.583 --> 30:21.375
That's me in the,
uh, swim trunks.

30:21.458 --> 30:23.083
Lord have mercy.

30:24.125 --> 30:26.041
These are our
housemates..

30:26.125 --> 30:28.083
...Brian, Doug, and Leonard.

30:28.166 --> 30:30.041
And this man..

30:30.125 --> 30:33.208
...is Leonard's
hot summer romance.

30:39.625 --> 30:41.709
Paul was thinner then.

30:43.792 --> 30:45.959
When I went
to the party that night

30:46.041 --> 30:48.166
I didn't know
he was Jeff's brother.

30:48.250 --> 30:49.417
How'd you find out?

30:49.500 --> 30:52.208
I recognized him
from family photos.

30:52.291 --> 30:55.000
Same swim trunks.

30:55.083 --> 30:57.208
I realized Jeff didn't know.

30:57.291 --> 31:00.542
- So you told him?
- No.

31:00.625 --> 31:03.291
I went outside for a smoke

31:03.375 --> 31:06.041
there was the man himself.

31:12.333 --> 31:13.875
Paul?

31:13.959 --> 31:15.959
Carson Finch.

31:16.041 --> 31:17.667
Of course.

31:17.750 --> 31:19.709
I had no idea you
were Jeff's
brother.

31:21.125 --> 31:23.583
Listen, this is..

31:23.667 --> 31:27.583
I'm married now,
and my family doesn't know--

31:27.667 --> 31:30.125
Say no more.
I understand.

31:30.959 --> 31:33.000
I read your column.

31:33.083 --> 31:34.041
You're crazy.

31:35.709 --> 31:38.166
Miss Finch isn't
everyone's cup of
tea.

31:42.125 --> 31:43.542
How's Leonard?

31:43.625 --> 31:46.083
I've been thinking
of sending him a card.

31:47.250 --> 31:48.959
Leonard died last year.

32:23.750 --> 32:25.166
Why didn't you tell anyone?

32:25.250 --> 32:26.667
(Carson)
'I didn't believe in
outing.'

32:28.625 --> 32:30.458
And then death outed us all.

32:34.250 --> 32:36.333
Paul's worried that
his brother will out him

32:36.417 --> 32:37.667
to their dad
at this meeting.

32:37.750 --> 32:39.792
Which, if dad
treats
his kids equally

32:39.875 --> 32:41.875
means Paul
gets disinherited, too.

32:41.959 --> 32:43.709
So he kills Jeff
the night before

32:43.792 --> 32:45.000
<i>Ipso facto.</i>

32:45.083 --> 32:47.208
Except we don't got
<i>factos.</i>

32:47.291 --> 32:49.041
Blood results
were
inconclusive.

32:49.125 --> 32:50.375
How come?

32:50.458 --> 32:52.500
Eighty-five percent
match to Jeff's DNA.

32:52.583 --> 32:54.709
The lab's assuming
the sample's
degraded.

32:54.792 --> 32:57.250
But there's another
explanation
for an almost match.

32:57.333 --> 32:58.375
A sibling.

32:58.458 --> 32:59.875
No, you can't
take
that to court.

32:59.959 --> 33:01.125
Now, we need a confession.

33:01.208 --> 33:03.375
He'll lawyer up
in record time, Scotty.

33:03.458 --> 33:05.458
Maybe not.

33:05.542 --> 33:09.875
I think, uh, Paul wants
to tell someone what he did.

33:09.959 --> 33:13.083
He put it on the quilt panel
he made for Jeff.

33:13.166 --> 33:15.250
"He was lost, and is found."

33:15.333 --> 33:16.917
(John Stillman)
'The Prodigal Son.'

33:17.000 --> 33:18.250
Someone want
to catch me up
here?

33:18.333 --> 33:20.500
I, uh, missed all
of Sunday school.

33:20.583 --> 33:23.166
It's a story about
two sons and a father.

33:23.250 --> 33:25.542
One son does everything
to please his father.

33:25.625 --> 33:27.291
- The other one..
- Bad.

33:27.375 --> 33:30.417
Goes off whoring and drinking,
shaming the family.

33:30.500 --> 33:33.208
While the good son
is home working the
field.

33:33.291 --> 33:36.375
Then one day the bad son
wants to come back home.

33:36.458 --> 33:38.917
'And the father
instantly forgives him'

33:39.000 --> 33:42.417
welcomes him,
and gives him his fatted
calf.

33:42.500 --> 33:43.583
All his stuff.

33:43.667 --> 33:46.208
Which makes
the good, dutiful
son

33:46.291 --> 33:48.917
very, very angry.

33:58.458 --> 33:59.750
I have a meeting in ten minutes.

33:59.834 --> 34:01.291
Not today, Paul.

34:02.834 --> 34:04.125
What are you doing?

34:04.208 --> 34:06.166
Telling you a story.

34:06.250 --> 34:09.000
Then we want you
to tell us a story.

34:09.083 --> 34:11.000
Sorry, you're losing me.

34:11.083 --> 34:14.458
"He was lost, and is found."

34:14.542 --> 34:16.583
The Prodigal Son?

34:21.166 --> 34:23.500
Wendy, get Ben Kelton
on the phone.

34:24.583 --> 34:26.834
I think you should talk
to my attorney.

34:26.917 --> 34:29.375
Look at that kingdom.

34:29.458 --> 34:30.834
All yours.

34:32.041 --> 34:33.333
The good son.

34:33.417 --> 34:36.500
You sacrificed for it.

34:36.583 --> 34:38.542
(Lilly)
'Gave up your own desires.'

34:38.625 --> 34:40.166
(Scotty)
'Did everything right.'

34:40.250 --> 34:41.417
And earned this.

34:41.500 --> 34:43.834
While Jeff went out and played.

34:43.917 --> 34:45.625
'Defied your father.'

34:45.709 --> 34:47.417
I loved my brother.

34:47.500 --> 34:50.333
As long as he was
exiled from the
family.

34:50.417 --> 34:53.917
But what if Jeff went
to your dad for help..

34:54.000 --> 34:55.667
...and they made amends?

34:57.125 --> 35:00.083
What if dad
welcomed him home?

35:01.667 --> 35:04.583
Would leave you
on the outside.

35:04.667 --> 35:06.917
You couldn't risk that.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.500
So you made sure
that meeting never happened.

35:09.583 --> 35:12.333
At least, that's the version
Paul likes to tell himself.

35:12.417 --> 35:14.083
- It's cleaner.
- Straighter.

35:14.166 --> 35:16.875
But it was simpler
than that, wasn't it, Paul?

35:19.542 --> 35:21.083
You had a secret.

35:22.959 --> 35:24.667
You were terrified

35:24.750 --> 35:27.542
Jeff would tell dad.

35:27.625 --> 35:29.208
Come on, Paul.

35:30.250 --> 35:32.000
You want to make it right.

35:34.125 --> 35:37.291
You confessed
20 years ago.

35:39.375 --> 35:42.041
[woman on intercom]
'Ben Kelton on the line.'

35:44.500 --> 35:46.917
Tell him..

35:47.000 --> 35:49.375
(sighs]
...I'll call him
back.

35:49.458 --> 35:50.709
'Yes, sir.'

35:55.083 --> 35:58.333
I...tried to talk to Jeff.

36:00.417 --> 36:01.542
- Thanks for treating.
- Yeah.

36:01.625 --> 36:02.917
I'm gonna walk that way

36:03.000 --> 36:05.375
pick up some
mocha-chip for
Artie.

36:05.458 --> 36:06.959
I'd like to be at dinner
tomorrow night

36:07.041 --> 36:08.333
with you and Dad.

36:08.417 --> 36:10.834
- I have to do it alone.
- Do what?

36:10.917 --> 36:12.083
Get Artie in the drug trial.

36:12.166 --> 36:14.291
- But how?
- Any way I can.

36:14.375 --> 36:17.417
Beg, bribe, blackmail.

36:17.500 --> 36:19.250
Would that include
ruining my life?

36:19.333 --> 36:21.625
What are you talking about?

36:28.333 --> 36:32.041
You saw me with Finch.

36:32.125 --> 36:35.834
Think I didn't know
you were a closet
case?

36:35.917 --> 36:37.959
It was one summer.

36:41.667 --> 36:43.291
Dad can't know.

36:43.375 --> 36:44.667
I would never out you.

36:44.750 --> 36:47.125
You threatened to out
a room full of men.

36:47.208 --> 36:48.917
- They're not my brother.
- I know you.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.750
You can't control yourself
when you want something.

36:51.834 --> 36:53.125
- Don't be crazy.
- He'll piss you off.

36:53.208 --> 36:55.125
You'll do anything
to help Artie.

36:55.208 --> 36:56.583
Paul, I won't hurt you.

36:56.667 --> 36:58.959
You don't want to,
but you will!

36:59.041 --> 37:00.959
- Cool off.
- Me?

37:01.041 --> 37:04.166
- Cool off?
- Go home to your wife.

37:05.291 --> 37:08.583
No. I won't let you.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.834
- Paul!
- No!

37:13.917 --> 37:15.875
I gave up too much.
