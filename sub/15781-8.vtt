twins.

09:14.053 --> 09:15.544
Twin coeds.

09:15.621 --> 09:17.817
Yeah, I wouldn't
answer those.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.358
Fans of my show, obviously.

09:19.425 --> 09:22.054
Don't wanna encourage them.
What's this?

09:22.128 --> 09:23.994
If it's a Nigerian prince

09:24.063 --> 09:25.793
asking you
to take $12 million,

09:25.865 --> 09:27.493
he never sends it.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.297
And then you have to explain
to your wife,

09:29.368 --> 09:31.303
who leaves you, for...
other reasons.

09:31.370 --> 09:32.497
You're kidding me?!

09:32.572 --> 09:33.870
No!

09:33.940 --> 09:35.704
I mean, the guy seemed
on the up and up.

09:35.775 --> 09:38.335
Poor kid couldn't get
to his money.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.709
Not that!

09:39.779 --> 09:41.714
I'm being slammed
for a zoning violation.

09:41.781 --> 09:44.216
It seems my idiot grandfather
zoned my estate

09:44.283 --> 09:47.378
for "the care and upkeep
of American rightness

09:47.453 --> 09:49.888
and the active defense
of her civil needs."

09:49.956 --> 09:51.322
What does that mean?

09:51.390 --> 09:52.915
Uh, according to this,
it means

09:52.992 --> 09:55.223
that I must have 3/4
of my estate do-gooding

09:55.294 --> 09:57.388
or I lose my property

09:57.463 --> 09:59.591
to whatever the Mammoth
Corporation is.

09:59.665 --> 10:02.032
Geesh,
what are we gonna do?

10:02.101 --> 10:04.661
Well, I'm gonna start by kicking
the Johnson family out

10:04.737 --> 10:06.035
of the missile silo.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.334
And I'm also pretty sure
that those guys

10:07.406 --> 10:09.136
in the old
propulsion research lab

10:09.208 --> 10:10.198
are cooking meth.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.437
It's a shame.

10:11.510 --> 10:12.944
They always pay
their rent on time.

10:13.012 --> 10:17.040
[splashing ]

10:19.118 --> 10:22.054
Damn it, Shoreleave,
you ruined another outfit.

10:22.121 --> 10:23.646
Think Betsy Ross works here?

10:23.723 --> 10:25.749
I'm the one who has to sew this
back together, you clown!

10:25.825 --> 10:28.556
What are you laughing about,
"Mr. Bloodstains on Everything"?

10:28.628 --> 10:30.756
You know that he just
rips those himself.

10:30.830 --> 10:33.629
He just tears it off
like a Chippendales' fireman.

10:33.699 --> 10:35.065
Every time.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.124
Good God, why?

10:36.202 --> 10:38.398
For one, because
it looks super cool.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.099
You're an infant!
How's the bath working?

10:40.172 --> 10:41.504
No idea.
We're used to it.

10:41.574 --> 10:42.701
You tell us.

10:42.775 --> 10:43.606
[sniffs ]

10:43.676 --> 10:45.975
Sorry boys, you smell like
tomato and crap soup.

10:46.045 --> 10:48.139
Hunter, this just came in
on the telex.

10:48.214 --> 10:50.149
So what!

10:50.216 --> 10:51.650
The man-shaped mountain
does that all the time.

10:51.717 --> 10:53.242
Read what he's taking over.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.515
Stop playing Jimmy Olsen
and just tell me.

10:55.588 --> 10:57.648
Mmm, not in front of...
you know, him.

10:57.723 --> 10:59.851
What?
What's being taken over?

10:59.925 --> 11:01.257
Nothing.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.091
The boy has Tourette's syndrome
or something.

11:03.162 --> 11:04.687
Uh, right.
Whoop!

11:04.764 --> 11:06.392
Pickled penis!
Pickled penis!

11:06.465 --> 11:07.592
My underwear is on fire.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.101
It's tragic.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.500
Not a damned thing
you can do about it.

11:10.569 --> 11:12.663
- Whoop!
- Poor bastard.

11:12.738 --> 11:15.936
[ yawning ]

11:21.547 --> 11:23.311
I thought you were doing

11:23.382 --> 11:25.681
your big "I'll get you,
Dr. Venture" thing today?

11:25.751 --> 11:27.652
This is it.
I'm arching.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.586
This is my big plan.
Check it out.

11:29.655 --> 11:31.590
Well, uh, what
did I miss?

11:31.657 --> 11:34.126
Let me see, uh...
well, 36 asked

11:34.193 --> 11:36.788
if I thought that Leonard Maltin
had had work done.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.457
And I said, "have you seen
Mickey Rourke?"

11:39.532 --> 11:41.524
Yeah, he looks like he was
made by a cobbler.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.933
He does!
So... exciting, huh?

11:44.003 --> 11:45.699
Wooo!

11:45.771 --> 11:47.603
I'm having Monstroso
attack Venture...

11:47.673 --> 11:49.073
with paperwork!

11:49.141 --> 11:50.131
Weee!

11:50.209 --> 11:51.040
Monstroso!

11:51.110 --> 11:52.408
That's what this is about?!

11:52.478 --> 11:53.912
He's king
of the double cross.

11:53.979 --> 11:55.447
I mean, think about it.

11:55.514 --> 11:57.312
He's a lawyer
and a super villain.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.648
That's like a shark with
a grenade launcher on its head.

11:59.719 --> 12:00.778
She's right!

12:00.853 --> 12:02.879
Monstroso's planning on seizing
all of Venture's property

12:02.955 --> 12:03.979
and yours!

12:04.056 --> 12:05.649
- How do you know that?
- It's all right here.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.660
I lifted a Blackberry off
one of his henchmen.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.593
It had every access code
and password.

12:09.662 --> 12:12.530
So apparently you signed away
all your rights

12:12.598 --> 12:15.625
as Venture's primary arch
to Monstroso.

12:15.701 --> 12:17.693
What?
That dick!

12:17.770 --> 12:19.261
I will kill him!

12:19.338 --> 12:21.398
He's right.
It's all here.

12:21.474 --> 12:23.375
Nice job, 21.

12:23.442 --> 12:25.274
I'm impressed.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.551
Dude, that was so great!

12:40.626 --> 12:43.061
She was just smooshing them
in there.

12:43.129 --> 12:45.155
- I know!
- You know what?

12:45.231 --> 12:48.326
Uh, I know what
I have to do.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.665
BILLY:
We don't need much room
for what we do,

12:50.736 --> 12:52.728
and that's why
we can't pay that much

12:52.805 --> 12:54.068
because we don't do
that much.

12:54.140 --> 12:55.472
We actually don't do
anything.

12:55.541 --> 12:56.372
I'll cut you a break.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.104
I just need to have at least
70% of my estate

12:58.177 --> 13:00.772
allotted to community vigilance
and safeguarding rightness.

13:00.846 --> 13:02.246
What does that even mean?

13:02.314 --> 13:05.409
It means that Quizboy and the
Pink Phantom have arrived.

13:05.484 --> 13:07.077
High five!

13:07.153 --> 13:08.621
Yep, welcome to the world

13:08.687 --> 13:10.383
of super science, action
and adventure.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.152
Rules!

13:12.224 --> 13:14.250
Will somebody hit this?
I'm hanging here.

13:14.326 --> 13:16.192
Come on, Rusty,
you know we can't get

13:16.262 --> 13:18.595
the super scientist community
to take us seriously.

13:18.664 --> 13:20.599
You guys are ready.
It's easy.

13:20.666 --> 13:22.931
You park a hovercraft in there,
and once a month you go

13:23.002 --> 13:25.335
to a soup kitchen and lance
boils off homeless guys.

13:25.404 --> 13:26.872
You don't need
costumes or anything.

13:26.939 --> 13:28.874
Oh, yes we do!

13:28.941 --> 13:30.273
Well, this is it.

13:30.342 --> 13:31.901
It isn't so impressive
on the outside,

13:31.977 --> 13:34.537
but I think you'll be impressed
with the inside.

13:34.613 --> 13:38.243
Just needs a little bit of --
What the fuck!?

13:38.317 --> 13:40.377
BILLY:
It's perfect!

13:40.452 --> 13:41.476
Where do I sign?

13:44.523 --> 13:47.254
Um, I know I'm not really up
on this confusing crap,

13:47.326 --> 13:49.852
but isn't S.P.H.I.N.X.
the bad guys?

13:49.929 --> 13:52.296
They were, but we annihilated
the real S.P.H.I.N.X.

13:52.364 --> 13:54.731
in the Pyramid Wars
of '87.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.826
So, when we went rogue,
we just went --

13:56.902 --> 13:59.030
"Hey, why don't we use
these fresh costumes,

13:59.104 --> 14:01.869
and all this sweet Egypt-themed
equipment we captured."

14:01.941 --> 14:03.534
You guys aren't with
the O.S.I. Anymore?

14:03.609 --> 14:04.702
Hell no, son.

14:04.777 --> 14:07.042
We all joined the O.S.I.
with pie-eyed dreams

14:07.112 --> 14:08.705
of saving the world
from baddies.

14:08.781 --> 14:09.942
And what did we get?

14:10.015 --> 14:12.143
Hot bureaucracy poured
in our laps.

14:12.218 --> 14:14.551
As S.P.H.I.N.X., we can
whip-up foamy justice

14:14.620 --> 14:16.282
any way we want.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.824
The O.S.I. plays their game
of tag with the Guild.

14:18.891 --> 14:20.951
But when someone refuses
the costumed life...

14:21.026 --> 14:22.892
S.P.H.I.N.X.!

14:22.962 --> 14:24.487
Can we join?

14:24.563 --> 14:25.622
Uh, speak
for yourself, Billy.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.428
Don't kid yourself,
short round.

14:27.499 --> 14:29.559
You two are gonna wake up
tomorrow with your memory wiped.

14:29.635 --> 14:31.604
How's that metal hi-five
treating you these days?

14:31.670 --> 14:35.072
With all due respect,
I hate you.

14:35.140 --> 14:36.108
I know!

14:36.175 --> 14:37.473
And tomorrow,
you will love me!

14:37.543 --> 14:40.308
You know, this is
the answer to my problems.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.007
You guys just need to pay
some back rent

14:42.081 --> 14:43.310
and sign some papers.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.078
Wrong-o!

14:45.150 --> 14:46.641
S.P.H.I.N.X.
works in the shadows.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.244
We are ghosts.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.084
I couldn't tell anyone
about this.

14:50.155 --> 14:52.317
Doc, seriously,
it's important work.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.087
That's why we're all here.

14:54.159 --> 14:55.923
You're here because you forgot
to leave me your keys.

14:55.995 --> 14:58.089
I mean, why we're here
on this planet.

14:58.163 --> 14:59.756
We had to make
sacrifices.

14:59.832 --> 15:01.300
Like covering yourselves
in rotten eggs.

15:01.367 --> 15:02.266
Do you know how bad
you smell?

15:02.334 --> 15:03.495
No, ass!

15:03.569 --> 15:05.299
Like living next to the boys
for a year

15:05.371 --> 15:06.839
and not being able to tell them
that they're safe.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.102
That kinda sacrifice!

15:09.174 --> 15:11.200
I had my pud removed,
then reattached.

15:11.277 --> 15:13.508
I pretended that I became
a religious fanatic.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.275
I pretended to be
in love with Shoreleave.

15:15.347 --> 15:17.282
Oh! And I pretended

15:17.349 --> 15:19.284
I liked having sex with him
every night.

15:19.351 --> 15:22.185
Uh, intruder
at the front gate.

15:22.254 --> 15:24.746
SPHINX STATUE:
Intruder at the front gate.

15:24.823 --> 15:29.727
The Sphinx has spoken.

15:29.795 --> 15:31.263
How much do you want
for that watch of yours?

15:31.330 --> 15:33.731
Ours is way too creepy.

15:52.885 --> 15:54.547
Psst! 24.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.215
Hey, 24.
Dude!

15:57.289 --> 15:59.019
Yes, my master.

15:59.091 --> 16:01.560
Dude, what is this,
I Dream of Jeannie?

16:01.627 --> 16:03.255
I need you to check out
the Venture compound

16:03.329 --> 16:04.558
and deactivate the alarms.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.064
I'm not a poltergeist.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.155
I can't move stuff.

16:07.232 --> 16:09.133
But I'll take a look around
if you do that thing

16:09.201 --> 16:10.567
for a couple
of my new friends.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.104
Oh, come on!

16:12.171 --> 16:13.639
Okay, fine.
Quickly.

16:13.706 --> 16:17.234
I'm in a hurry.

16:17.309 --> 16:19.505
This is Speedy.
You remember him.

16:19.578 --> 16:21.911
And President Woodrow Wilson.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.779
Yeah, they bet me
you couldn't do it.

16:23.849 --> 16:24.839
Velvet hour!

16:24.917 --> 16:26.852
Kate Moss.
Easy.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.251
Still?

16:28.320 --> 16:29.219
Umm, Jennifer Lopez.

16:29.288 --> 16:30.916
- Covet?
- Sarah Jessica Parker.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.959
And she also has Lovely,
and Twilight, and Dawn.

16:33.025 --> 16:34.254
And a whole bunch more.

16:34.326 --> 16:35.624
Astonishing.

16:35.694 --> 16:38.630
He is like the rain man
of celebrity signature perfumes.

16:38.697 --> 16:40.359
Unscripted?!

16:40.432 --> 16:41.957
Patrick Dempsey.
I know, it's insane.

16:42.034 --> 16:44.265
Tim McGraw and Carlos Santana
also have them.

16:44.336 --> 16:45.895
All right, you guys, I win.

16:45.971 --> 16:47.906
Looks like you have
to tell Helen of Troy

16:47.973 --> 16:49.703
how awesome I am.
Beat it.

16:49.775 --> 16:52.677
Jeez! Okay, now you gotta
go secure the compound.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.373
I'm gonna wait here
for Monstroso

16:54.446 --> 16:56.381
and deal with him
the old-fashioned way.

16:56.448 --> 16:58.383
You're gonna sew him
a quilt?

16:58.450 --> 17:00.214
No, douche, I'm gonna
whale on him.

17:00.285 --> 17:01.480
I can't secure anything.

17:01.553 --> 17:03.419
Come on!
You help me all the time!

17:03.489 --> 17:05.082
Do I?

17:05.156 --> 17:07.251
Or do I just let you
feel secure enough

17:07.326 --> 17:08.885
to trust your intuition?

17:08.961 --> 17:11.260
No, you are real!
Real!

17:11.329 --> 17:13.925
If you say so.

17:13.999 --> 17:17.265
We will drag his ass in front
of the Council of Thirteen!

17:17.336 --> 17:19.737
Nobody double crosses
the Monarch!

17:19.805 --> 17:22.434
Honey, the double cross
isn't a Guild offence.

17:22.508 --> 17:24.602
They actually encourage
that kind of thing.

17:24.675 --> 17:27.441
Trust me, Monstroso
knows Guild law.

17:27.512 --> 17:29.573
But we gotta do something!

17:29.648 --> 17:31.844
It's 21, sir.

17:31.917 --> 17:33.545
He's stolen
the Monarch mobile.

17:33.619 --> 17:35.713
He's gone all crazy again.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.723
We think he plans
on attacking Monstroso.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.122
- Good.
- What?

17:39.191 --> 17:41.217
Good, we didn't order it.
We're in the clear.

17:41.293 --> 17:43.888
If one of our henchmen goes
behind our backs and fixes this,

17:43.962 --> 17:45.624
I'm not gonna stop him.

17:45.697 --> 17:46.687
You're right!

17:46.765 --> 17:48.427
And 21 might actually succeed.

17:48.500 --> 17:51.800
And you two little snitches
have work to do, I believe.

17:51.870 --> 17:53.168
We do?

17:53.238 --> 17:54.729
Yeah, go clean
the toilets or something.

17:54.807 --> 17:56.969
No, no, no, motherf--
are you serious?

17:57.042 --> 17:59.273
You heard your leader!

17:59.344 --> 18:01.870
Those two are really
starting to burn my ass.

18:01.947 --> 18:03.939
You can either follow me
to our bedroom,

18:04.016 --> 18:07.077
or bend over
that control throne.

18:07.152 --> 18:10.281
Because I haven't been this
turned on in forever.

18:12.558 --> 18:14.925
Brock Samson...

18:14.993 --> 18:16.427
at last we meet.

18:16.495 --> 18:17.656
Do I know you?

18:17.729 --> 18:20.324
Don't pull that shit
with me!

18:20.399 --> 18:22.391
[grunting ]

18:24.503 --> 18:26.802
I don't know why you're here,
and I don't care.

18:26.872 --> 18:29.398
I have been waiting for this
moment for a year.

18:29.475 --> 18:32.707
Boo.

18:32.778 --> 18:35.976
Ah, very nice.
Somebody's been training.

18:36.048 --> 18:38.517
This is like Christmas,
my first BMX bike,

18:38.584 --> 18:41.247
and meeting the cast of Firefly
all in one.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.312
Let's go!
Come on, Samson, bring it!

18:43.388 --> 18:45.482
Okay, Tubs.

18:45.557 --> 18:49.688
Let's see what else you got.

18:49.761 --> 18:52.526
You didn't think I was gonna
take it easy on you, did ya?

18:52.598 --> 18:54.294
I was fucking praying
you wouldn't.

18:54.366 --> 18:56.198
You gotta bring it!

18:56.268 --> 18:57.896
[screams ]

18:57.970 --> 19:01.031
[screams ]

19:05.244 --> 19:08.237
Come on!

19:08.313 --> 19:09.838
Well, if you can't solve
my problem

19:09.915 --> 19:11.679
with this Monstroso character,

19:11.750 --> 19:12.740
you gotta pack this up.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.548
And there will be a late fee
with that back rent.

19:14.620 --> 19:16.612
Oh, we'll solve your problem
with Monstroso.

19:16.688 --> 19:18.350
But not legally.

19:18.423 --> 19:21.257
S.P.H.I.N.X. solves problems
their own special way.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.921
Don't worry, we have
Brock Lobster taking care of it.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.828
He's clean as a whistle.

19:25.898 --> 19:27.526
Won't remember a thing.

19:27.599 --> 19:29.033
Aren't you gonna wipe
my memory?

19:29.101 --> 19:30.034
White, you lazy bastard,
if you had

19:30.102 --> 19:32.003
even an ounce
of the little guy's moxie,

19:32.070 --> 19:34.471
I'd be cleaning you like
a toilet seat.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.441
Um, what's going on?

19:36.508 --> 19:37.441
Oh, great.

19:37.509 --> 19:40.946
Is the uh, washing machine
still warm?

19:41.013 --> 19:42.276
You're sure
that thing works?

19:42.347 --> 19:44.714
Shoreleave! You have fun with
those homophobic drug lords

19:44.783 --> 19:46.513
you were imprisoned with
last week?

19:46.585 --> 19:49.214
Prison?
I was here last week.

19:49.288 --> 19:50.813
Come on in, boys.

19:50.889 --> 19:53.017
Hey, did I ever tell you
about your mother?

19:53.091 --> 19:55.959
Or that you are both clones?

19:56.028 --> 19:57.724
What?

19:57.796 --> 19:59.628
21!

19:59.698 --> 20:02.668
You must go
to the Dagoba system.

20:02.734 --> 20:04.430
There you will meet
the Jedi master

20:04.503 --> 20:06.062
who instructed me.

20:06.138 --> 20:07.731
Good one.

20:07.806 --> 20:10.332
Thanks.
But I'll hand it to ya,

20:10.409 --> 20:13.243
you really can deliver
a pretty decent beating.

20:13.312 --> 20:14.371
[groans ]

20:14.446 --> 20:15.539
I really thought
I had a chance

20:15.614 --> 20:16.741
'cause when I got next to you,

20:16.815 --> 20:18.750
I swear it smelled like
you crapped yourself.

20:18.817 --> 20:20.285
That's not, uh...

20:20.352 --> 20:21.684
that's from something else.

20:21.753 --> 20:23.517
Obviously.

20:23.589 --> 20:25.182
What are you doing here?

20:25.257 --> 20:26.657
I heard you went over
to the other side.

20:26.725 --> 20:29.320
Who cares why I'm here.
Why are you here?

20:29.394 --> 20:30.487
What do you mean,
why am I here?

20:30.562 --> 20:32.622
Monstroso's taking our place
and this place over.

20:32.698 --> 20:34.394
The only way I could
think to stop him

20:34.466 --> 20:35.866
was an old-fashioned ambush.

20:35.934 --> 20:37.402
So, you're being a hero, huh?

20:37.469 --> 20:38.596
Yeah, I guess so.

20:38.670 --> 20:42.903
Well, then you gotta think
bigger than ambush.

20:46.044 --> 20:47.979
[doorknob rattles ]

20:48.046 --> 20:49.412
Can I help you?

20:49.481 --> 20:50.915
Is this locked or something?

20:50.983 --> 20:52.975
It goes counter clockwise.

20:53.051 --> 20:56.112
I'd like you to tear up
that last agreement

20:56.188 --> 20:57.247
you made with the Monarch.

20:57.322 --> 20:59.917
Oh, really.
And you are...?

20:59.992 --> 21:03.429
Just a concerned
citizen/Jedi/ninja is all.

21:03.495 --> 21:05.760
Idiot.
Get out.

21:05.831 --> 21:07.390
What are you doing there --
calling your men?

21:07.466 --> 21:09.935
Ah, they're sleeping.
I put 'em to bed.

21:10.002 --> 21:12.494
Shh, don't wake 'em.
It's rude.

21:12.571 --> 21:15.405
Okay, little guy.

21:16.675 --> 21:18.234
You really wanna do this?

21:18.310 --> 21:20.939
I'm twice your size.

21:21.013 --> 21:22.606
Not anymore.

21:22.681 --> 21:25.549
[ both screaming ]

22:07.559 --> 22:09.494
G'night, Brock.

22:09.561 --> 22:11.086
Good night, Hank.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.688
[glass breaks ]
Brock?!
