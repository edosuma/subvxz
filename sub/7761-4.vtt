WEBVTT

00:10.144 --> 00:11.512
- * ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR

00:11.545 --> 00:13.647
* FIVE, SIX, SHAKE IT, DUDE

00:13.681 --> 00:21.589
*

00:35.369 --> 00:37.438
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

00:45.846 --> 00:49.717
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

00:49.750 --> 00:53.621
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

00:53.654 --> 00:56.724
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

01:00.661 --> 01:03.297
- NOT THAT WALL.
IT'S NOT DRY YET.

01:03.331 --> 01:05.566
- THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE,
IT WAS NO-TOWELS NIGHT.

01:05.599 --> 01:08.469
- YEAH, 100 GUYS
MUST'VE TOUCHED MY STIFFIE.

01:08.502 --> 01:09.737
- MR. POPULAR.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.639
AND I'M THE ONLY ONE
YOU FUCKED.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.641
- LUCKY YOU.
IT'S NICE WORK, TOMMY.

01:13.674 --> 01:15.643
- THANKS, MR. KINNEY.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.311
- LEAVE IT TO YOU
TO TURN A BATHHOUSE

01:17.345 --> 01:20.214
INTO THE WORLDWIDE HEADQUARTERS
OF KINNETIK, INC.

01:22.683 --> 01:25.186
[chuckles]
THE OLD STEAM ROOM.

01:25.219 --> 01:26.887
IT'S THE FIRST PLACE
WE EVER FUCKED IN PUBLIC.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.756
- [chuckles]

01:28.789 --> 01:31.592
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE PERFORMING
IN FRONT OF A LIVE AUDIENCE.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.461
- WHO SAID SOME OF THOSE GUYS
WERE ALIVE?

01:33.494 --> 01:34.595
- THE ART DEPARTMENT
WANTS TO KNOW

01:34.628 --> 01:35.663
IF YOU'VE SEEN THE MOCK-UPS.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.331
HI, JUSTIN.
- HEY, CYNTHIA.

01:37.365 --> 01:39.600
- YEAH, CAN YOU TELL MANNY
TO USE A 300 DPI TIFF,

01:39.633 --> 01:41.735
AND SHOOT IT BACK TO ME
FOR MY APPROVAL, FAST.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.337
DEADLINE'S AT 6:00.

01:43.371 --> 01:46.407
- ALSO, BROWN ATHLETICS CALLED,
ASKED TO MEET.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.676
SAID THEY HATE WHAT VANGARD DID
WITH THEIR NEW CAMPAIGN.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.644
- YEAH, I WONDER WHY.

01:50.678 --> 01:53.214
UM, TELL THEM I'M IN MEETINGS
AND I'LL CALL THEM TOMORROW.

01:53.247 --> 01:54.882
OKAY, LET 'EM SQUIRM.
- OH, AND

01:54.915 --> 01:56.750
YOUR ACCOUNTANT
LEFT A MESSAGE:

01:56.784 --> 01:58.886
"THE CHECK FOR THE ENDOVIR AD
WILL DEFINITELY

01:58.919 --> 02:00.554
"BE WIRED TO HEAT MAGAZINE

02:00.588 --> 02:01.755
BY THE END OF BUSINESS DAY
TOMORROW."

02:01.789 --> 02:03.557
- DAMN WELL BETTER BE.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.759
OUR LIVES
ARE DEPENDING ON IT.

02:05.793 --> 02:08.362
WELL, MOVE.

02:08.396 --> 02:11.832
- GOD. I LOVE MY JOB.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.834
- AND I LOVE IT
WHEN YOU GET BOSSY.

02:13.867 --> 02:16.370
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE CHRISTEN MY NEW OFFICE?

02:16.404 --> 02:17.638
I HAVE 15 MINUTES

02:17.671 --> 02:19.540
BEFORE I HAVE TO APPROVE
AD COPY.

02:19.573 --> 02:21.375
- ALWAYS THE ROMANTIC.

02:21.409 --> 02:24.345
BUT I HAVE A STRATEGY MEETING
WITH THE POSSE.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.452
- "IN A BRIEF PARAGRAPH,

02:31.485 --> 02:33.787
EXPLAIN WHY YOU WANT TO BE
FOSTER PARENTS."

02:33.821 --> 02:36.257
SOUNDS LIKE AN ASSIGNMENT
FOR YOU, PROFESSOR.

02:36.290 --> 02:38.426
- HOW ABOUT,
"WE WANT TO GIVE A CHILD

02:38.459 --> 02:40.294
"THE LOVE AND SUPPORT
HE NEEDS

02:40.328 --> 02:41.529
"TO HELP HIM FULFILL
HIS DREAMS

02:41.562 --> 02:43.664
AND ACHIEVE HIS GOALS."

02:43.697 --> 02:45.833
- I HAPPEN TO BE EATING.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.401
DON'T MAKE ME PUKE.

02:47.435 --> 02:49.403
- HEY, IT MAY NOT WIN
A PULITZER PRIZE,

02:49.437 --> 02:50.871
BUT I THINK IT SAYS IT ALL.

02:50.904 --> 02:52.740
- HOLY SHIT.
LOOK AT THIS.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.708
IT SAYS, "SOCIAL SERVICES
MAY DROP BY FOR A VISIT

02:54.742 --> 02:56.410
AT ANY TIME, UNANNOUNCED."

02:56.444 --> 02:58.479
- WHAT IF THEY DO?
WE HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.680
- EXCEPT FOR THAT
DOUBLE-HEADED DILDO.

02:59.713 --> 03:00.981
- HEY!

03:01.014 --> 03:03.351
ANY DILDO WE MIGHT
HAVE IS HIDDEN AWAY

03:03.384 --> 03:04.718
WHERE NO ONE CAN FIND IT.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.287
- YEAH, I'LL BET.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.322
- LISTEN, SMART-ASS,
FROM NOW ON,

03:08.356 --> 03:09.957
THERE WILL BE NO MORE
LEWD COMMENTS,

03:09.990 --> 03:11.859
THERE WILL BE NO MORE
SEXUAL INNUENDO.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.994
- SO MUCH FOR CONVERSATION.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.563
- HELLO, MEN,

03:15.596 --> 03:18.299
AND LITTLE MEN.

03:18.332 --> 03:19.733
- YOU LOOK EXHAUSTED.

03:19.767 --> 03:21.569
- YOU OUT CLUBBING ALL NIGHT?

03:21.602 --> 03:24.004
- WELL, EVER SINCE I MOVED IN
WITH MY FAVORITE LESBIANS,

03:24.037 --> 03:25.706
I'M TRYING TO BE
A MODEL HOUSE GUEST.

03:25.739 --> 03:26.907
TROUBLE IS,

03:26.940 --> 03:29.009
I HAVE NO PLACE
TO ENTERTAIN.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.611
- DOORWAYS ARE ALWAYS GOOD.

03:30.644 --> 03:34.615
SO ARE BACK ALLEYS,
UNDER PARKED TRUCKS.

03:34.648 --> 03:37.485
I USED TO FUCK FOR A LIVING,
REMEMBER?

03:37.518 --> 03:38.719
- RIGHT. WELL,

03:38.752 --> 03:41.355
EXPERT PROFESSIONAL TIPS
ALWAYS WELCOME.

03:41.389 --> 03:43.991
HOWEVER, UH, WE ELECTED
TO TRY THE CEMETERY.

03:44.024 --> 03:45.759
DIDN'T WE, GORDON?
- JORDAN.

03:45.793 --> 03:47.461
- JORDAN.

03:47.495 --> 03:48.996
IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF EROTIC,

03:49.029 --> 03:52.466
IN A CREEPY, MACABRE
SORT OF WAY.

03:52.500 --> 03:55.002
- HERE'S YOUR LAUNDRY, BOYS.

03:55.035 --> 03:56.670
NOW I'M NOT NAMING ANY NAMES,

03:56.704 --> 03:58.606
BUT I HAD A HELL OF A TIME
GETTING THE SKID MARKS

03:58.639 --> 04:01.609
OUT OF A PAIR OF SIZE 28
TIGHTY WHITIES.

04:01.642 --> 04:04.011
- CHRIST!

04:04.044 --> 04:06.280
- MA, I TOLD YOU,
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

04:06.314 --> 04:07.948
- I KNOW I DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO IT.

04:07.981 --> 04:10.351
I WANTED TO DO IT.

04:10.384 --> 04:11.485
JUST LIKE I WANTED
TO MAKE YOU DINNER.

04:11.519 --> 04:12.620
- THE LAST THREE NIGHTS.

04:12.653 --> 04:14.021
- AND GROUT YOUR TILES.

04:14.054 --> 04:15.656
- TOOK YOU TWO DAYS.

04:15.689 --> 04:19.059
- YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT,
DO YOU, BEN?

04:19.092 --> 04:21.495
- NO, DEBBIE.
NO PROBLEM AT ALL.

04:21.529 --> 04:24.064
WE LOVE HAVING YOU AROUND.
- GOOD.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.267
'CAUSE I LOVE BEING
WITH MY BOYS.

04:28.836 --> 04:29.937
SAY, EM, HONEY?

04:29.970 --> 04:31.539
WANNA TAKE THOSE OFF?

04:31.572 --> 04:34.542
I CAN WASH THOSE GRASS STAINS
OUT IN A JIFF.

04:41.682 --> 04:44.385
- BLOCK YOUR BODY
WITH YOUR FOREARM.

04:44.418 --> 04:46.387
THEN EXECUTE A JAB,

04:46.420 --> 04:50.658
RIGHT-LEFT HOOK COMBINATION
LIKE THIS.

04:50.691 --> 04:53.394
NOW YOU TRY IT.

04:53.427 --> 04:54.928
- [grunting]

04:54.962 --> 04:57.331
- NOT BAD.

04:57.365 --> 04:59.533
NOW, IF YOU WANT TO REALLY TAKE
DOWN THE MOTHERFUCKER,

04:59.567 --> 05:01.335
GRAB HIM LIKE THIS,

05:01.369 --> 05:02.936
CHOKE THE SHIT OUT OF HIM,

05:02.970 --> 05:04.805
THEN KICK HIM IN THE BALLS.

05:04.838 --> 05:07.741
OKAY, WHO'S NEXT?

05:07.775 --> 05:09.943
- I THOUGHT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
PROTECTING PEOPLE.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.413
- NOT TRAINING TO BE AN ELITE
KILLING SQUAD.

05:12.446 --> 05:14.682
- WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO STOP
TROUBLE BEFORE IT STARTS.

05:14.715 --> 05:15.983
- FIND THEM
BEFORE THEY FIND US.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.851
- I'M NOT GOING OUT
PICKING FIGHTS.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.853
- THAT'S NOT WHAT
I SIGNED UP TO DO.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.088
- THIS IS FUCKED.

05:21.121 --> 05:23.424
- WHAT'S FUCKED
IS WAITING AROUND

05:23.457 --> 05:24.825
FOR SOMEONE ELSE
TO GET BASHED.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.894
WE NEED TO STAND UP TO THEM,

05:26.927 --> 05:28.596
SHOW THAT WE'RE NOT AFRAID.

05:28.629 --> 05:31.432
- SHOW 'EM YOURSELF.

05:31.465 --> 05:32.966
- WELL, CODY'S RIGHT.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.835
WE CAN'T SIT AROUND AND WAIT
FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN.

05:34.868 --> 05:37.738
IF WE WANT TO BE EFFECTIVE,
WE HAVE TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.106
- FUCKING PUSSIES!

05:39.139 --> 05:41.842
LET 'EM GO.

05:41.875 --> 05:42.910
WHO NEEDS THEM ANYWAY?

05:42.943 --> 05:44.945
COME ON.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.583
- HOW OLD IS GUS NOW?

05:49.617 --> 05:51.585
- ABOUT THREE.
- WOW.

05:51.619 --> 05:53.587
- OH. SAME AGE AS JARED

05:53.621 --> 05:56.524
WHEN THE COURTS GAVE HIM BACK
TO MY EX-HUSBAND.

05:59.092 --> 06:02.162
DAMN.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.465
HEY, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
HAVING FUN.

06:04.498 --> 06:05.766
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, HONEY.

06:05.799 --> 06:08.469
GOD, I HATE WOMEN WHO CRY,
DON'T YOU?

06:08.502 --> 06:10.604
- I'D CRY TOO, IF SOMEONE
TOOK GUS AWAY.

06:10.638 --> 06:11.805
THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT
OF CHANGES IN THE LAW

06:11.839 --> 06:13.006
SINCE THAT DECISION.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.008
- YEAH, NOT TO MENTION
THE WORLD.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.677
- IT ALSO DOESN'T HURT
THAT THE JUDGE WHO'S

06:16.710 --> 06:18.546
HEARING YOUR APPEAL HAS
A GAY-FRIENDLY TRACK RECORD.

06:18.579 --> 06:21.048
- AND THAT YOU HAVE
A BRILLIANT LAWYER.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.150
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL US.

06:23.183 --> 06:25.185
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE WOULD'VE
DONE WITHOUT YOU.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.887
- LAMB'S READY,
SO LET'S EAT.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.423
[overlapping chatter]

06:33.226 --> 06:35.496
- I THOUGHT THE GAY GENE
PROVIDED US ALL

06:35.529 --> 06:38.198
WITH AN INNATE ABILITY
TO REDECORATE, ACCESSORIZE,

06:38.231 --> 06:40.534
AND ARRANGE FLOWERS.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.169
- I THINK MINE'S RECESSIVE.

06:42.202 --> 06:44.071
- OH, ALLOW ME.

06:44.104 --> 06:47.207
ALL RIGHT. THIS...

06:47.240 --> 06:49.843
GOES HERE.

06:49.877 --> 06:51.845
- YOURS IS OBVIOUSLY DOMINANT.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.514
- THERE.

06:53.547 --> 06:56.216
SO, WHAT IS WITH THE SUDDEN
URGE TO BEAUTIFY?

06:56.249 --> 06:58.185
- I JUST THOUGHT THE PLACE
COULD USE A LITTLE SPRUCING UP.

06:58.218 --> 07:00.554
- MICHAEL, IT SAID
THE SOCIAL WORKER MAY,

07:00.588 --> 07:02.790
REPEAT, MAY, SHOW UP.

07:02.823 --> 07:05.593
- WHO SAID I'M DOING IT
BECAUSE OF THAT?

07:05.626 --> 07:07.060
ALL RIGHT, I AM DOING IT
BECAUSE OF THAT.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.796
BUT LIKE MEL SAID,

07:08.829 --> 07:10.964
GAY PARENTS HAVE TO BE BETTER
THAN STRAIGHT PARENTS.

07:10.998 --> 07:13.667
- WELL, I THINK THAT
YOUR WORRY, CONCERN,

07:13.701 --> 07:16.203
AND OBSESSIVE-
COMPULSIVENESS...

07:16.236 --> 07:18.672
ARE TOTALLY NEUROTIC...

07:18.706 --> 07:20.608
AND ADORABLE.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.743
I SAY LET'S JUST
BE OURSELVES.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.612
THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH.

07:24.645 --> 07:25.946
[door opens]

07:25.979 --> 07:27.548
- CAREFUL.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.116
YOU WANT THE SOCIAL WORKER
TO COME IN HERE

07:29.149 --> 07:30.751
AND SEE TWO HOMOS KISSING?

07:30.784 --> 07:33.554
- WOULD YOU PUT ON
SOME CLOTHES?

07:33.587 --> 07:34.955
AND USE A GLASS?

07:34.988 --> 07:39.627
- DUDE, YOU NEED
TO TAKE A CHILL PILL.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.228
- I JUST FLUFFED
THOSE PILLOWS.

07:41.261 --> 07:44.097
[knock at door]

07:44.131 --> 07:45.966
- OH, FUCK.
GET YOUR FEET OFF THE COUCH.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.000
GO AND GET DRESSED, NOW.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.702
- UH, EVERYTHING LOOKS GREAT.

07:48.736 --> 07:50.137
NOW JUST CALM DOWN.

07:50.170 --> 07:53.140
HYSTERIA ISN'T GOING TO HELP.

07:57.277 --> 08:00.147
- IT'S CANNELLONI NIGHT!

08:00.180 --> 08:02.583
I USED TO MAKE IT
FOR VIC AND RODNEY.

08:02.616 --> 08:04.785
AND NOW YOU GUYS
ARE THE LUCKY RECIPIENTS.

08:04.818 --> 08:05.986
- MA.
- [chuckles]

08:06.019 --> 08:07.588
WANNA WARM THIS UP?

08:07.621 --> 08:09.122
- UH, DEBBIE,
I'VE ALREADY MADE DINNER.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.624
IT'S SOY LOAF

08:10.658 --> 08:13.260
WITH, UH, MASHED TURNIPS
AND CARROT COULIS.

08:13.293 --> 08:14.728
- UH-HUH.

08:14.762 --> 08:15.929
SO YOU WANNA WARM THIS UP?

08:15.963 --> 08:17.064
- MA, PLEASE, NOT TONIGHT.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.599
- WHY NOT TONIGHT?

08:18.632 --> 08:19.867
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE
THE SOCIAL WORKER.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.735
- HONEY,
I'M THE SOCIAL DIRECTOR.

08:21.769 --> 08:24.772
SO COME ON IN
AND SIT DOWN.

08:26.306 --> 08:28.141
[sneezes]

08:28.175 --> 08:30.010
GET THESE FUCKING FLOWERS
OUT OF HERE.

08:30.043 --> 08:32.546
SIT DOWN.

08:32.580 --> 08:35.549
[slow music]

08:35.583 --> 08:43.523
*

09:01.842 --> 09:03.176
- TONIGHT IT'S YOUR TURN.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.579
- [chuckles]

09:05.613 --> 09:06.980
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.

09:07.014 --> 09:09.583
[grunts]

09:12.285 --> 09:14.788
- OKAY.

09:14.822 --> 09:17.725
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
WE'LL FIGHT FOR IT.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.126
COME ON.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.861
- WOULD YOU PLEASE GET YOUR ASS
BACK INTO BED?

09:20.894 --> 09:24.865
- WHY DON'T YOU GET YOURS OUT?

09:24.898 --> 09:26.667
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
ARE YOU SCARED?

09:26.700 --> 09:28.802
- YEAH, I'M INCAPACITATED
WITH FEAR.

09:28.836 --> 09:31.772
- THEN WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

09:36.409 --> 09:38.979
- [groans]

09:43.116 --> 09:45.719
- HMM.
OH, YEAH.

09:47.655 --> 09:48.856
WHERE'D YOU LEARN TO FIGHT?

09:48.889 --> 09:50.223
- CODY TAUGHT ME.
- REALLY?

09:50.257 --> 09:53.961
- UH-HUH.
- HUH-HAH.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.629
- THE OTHER NIGHT, I EVEN
TOOK OUT A STRAIGHT GUY.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.164
- I DATED A COUPLE
OF THOSE MYSELF.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.999
- [chuckles]

09:59.032 --> 10:01.034
- HEY! WATCH THE FACE, ASSHOLE.

10:01.068 --> 10:03.036
- COME ON, OLD MAN.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.705
- WHAT'D YOU CALL ME?

10:04.738 --> 10:06.907
- YOU HEARD ME, GEEZER.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.876
- UH-HUH.

10:08.909 --> 10:10.844
[both grunt]

10:10.878 --> 10:14.381
- OW.

10:14.414 --> 10:16.116
[sniffles]

10:16.149 --> 10:18.051
- CAREFUL, SONNY.

10:18.085 --> 10:19.419
YOU MIGHT GET HURT.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.421
- [grunts]
I DON'T CARE IF I GET HURT,

10:21.454 --> 10:22.990
AS LONG AS I HURT THEM MORE.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.257
THEY'RE NOT ALL ASSHOLES.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.993
THAT'S A LAUGH,
COMING FROM YOU.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.995
YOU'RE THE BIGGEST FUCKING
HETEROPHOBE OF ALL TIME.

10:28.028 --> 10:32.432
[both grunting]

10:32.465 --> 10:33.934
YOU ALWAYS SAID
THERE'S ONLY TWO KINDS

10:33.967 --> 10:35.903
OF STRAIGHT PEOPLE
IN THE WORLD:

10:35.936 --> 10:38.205
THE ONES WHO HATE YOU
TO YOUR FACE,

10:38.238 --> 10:40.140
AND THE KIND THAT HATE YOU
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.209
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
- WHAT?

10:42.242 --> 10:44.311
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
- [grunts]

10:52.853 --> 10:55.288
- I KNOW.
I PROMISED I'D CUT BACK.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.890
- DID I SAY ANYTHING?

10:56.924 --> 10:59.827
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
I'LL STOP.

11:09.136 --> 11:11.171
- I FEEL SO SORRY
FOR JEANETTE.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.106
ALL I COULD THINK OF WAS,

11:13.140 --> 11:15.108
"THANK GOD IT'S NOT US."

11:15.142 --> 11:17.845
AND, HOW LUCKY THEY ARE

11:17.878 --> 11:20.213
TO HAVE YOU
AS THEIR CHAMPION.

11:20.247 --> 11:21.481
IN FACT, MICHAEL AND JUSTIN
SHOULD CREATE

11:21.514 --> 11:25.052
A SUPERWOMAN CHARACTER
BASED ON YOU.

11:25.085 --> 11:29.222
- DYNO-DYKE?
- NOT BAD.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.859
- UNFORTUNATELY, THIS CASE
DOESN'T REQUIRE SUPERPOWERS,

11:31.892 --> 11:35.095
JUST LONG, HARD HOURS.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.930
- I WISH I COULD HELP.

11:36.964 --> 11:38.832
- YOU ALREADY HAVE.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.834
MORE THAN YOU KNOW.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.369
- [yawns]
- OH, GOD.

11:42.402 --> 11:45.105
GUESS I NEED TO BRUSH UP
ON MY ROMANTIC SUPERPOWERS.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.840
- NO, NO, NO.
IT'S NOT YOU.

11:46.874 --> 11:49.209
OH, IT'S LATE.

11:49.242 --> 11:52.179
- WHY DON'T YOU
GO BACK TO BED?

12:01.288 --> 12:03.090
- YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN
OVERTURN THE VERDICT,

12:03.123 --> 12:06.093
GET JEANETTE'S SON BACK?

12:06.126 --> 12:07.961
- OUR RESEARCH IS THOROUGH,

12:07.995 --> 12:10.363
OUR ARGUMENTS SOUND.

12:10.397 --> 12:11.865
IF NOT, THEN,

12:11.899 --> 12:13.901
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE
ONE ANGRY,

12:13.934 --> 12:16.870
PREGNANT LESBIAN TO DEAL WITH.

12:16.904 --> 12:19.873
- GO, DYNO-DYKE.

12:22.209 --> 12:24.044
- WELL, FIRST WE TRIED
THE LIBERTY BATHS.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.512
AND SOMEHOW,
THE FILTHY MATTRESS,

12:25.545 --> 12:27.380
THE AROMA OF STALE POPPERS

12:27.414 --> 12:29.416
AND STEPPING INTO PUDDLES
OF COLD CUM DIDN'T EXACTLY

12:29.449 --> 12:31.919
MOVE ME TO HUM
"ISN'T IT ROMANTIC."

12:31.952 --> 12:33.520
THEN WE TRIED THE GRAVEL PIT.

12:33.553 --> 12:36.790
HOW DANTE MANAGED TO OVERLOOK
IT, I'LL NEVER KNOW.

12:36.824 --> 12:39.059
SO FINALLY, HE WENT HOME
TO HIS MOTHER,

12:39.092 --> 12:41.561
AND I WENT HOME
TO MEL AND LINZ.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.897
- IT MAY BE TIME
TO GET YOUR OWN PLACE.

12:43.931 --> 12:46.266
- WELL, IT'S A THOUGHT.

12:46.299 --> 12:47.935
THERE ARE DEFINITE ADVANTAGES

12:47.968 --> 12:50.904
TO LIVING WITH LESBIANS,
HOWEVER.

12:53.373 --> 12:56.910
- I'M WAITING.

12:56.944 --> 12:59.880
- THE SHEETS ARE CLEAN,
AND THE MATTRESS IS FIRM...

12:59.913 --> 13:02.049
VERY FIRM.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.918
AND, UH, YOU'RE NEVER TEMPTED
TO OVEREAT AT MEALS.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.887
AND BEST OF ALL,
THERE'S OODLES OF ROOM

13:06.920 --> 13:09.222
IN THE MEDICINE CABINET
FOR MY COSMETICS.

13:09.256 --> 13:10.891
[bell dings]

13:10.924 --> 13:13.160
- WELL, SOUNDS LIKE
A LITTLE CORNER OF HEAVEN.

13:13.193 --> 13:14.427
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW HARD IT IS

13:14.461 --> 13:16.363
TO FIND QUAIL EGGS
IN THIS BURG?

13:16.396 --> 13:18.165
I'VE BEEN TO THREE MARKETS.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.100
- WELL, WE'LL JUST
USE CHICKEN EGGS.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.835
AS LONG AS THEY DON'T HATCH,
WHO'LL KNOW THE DIFFERENCE?

13:21.869 --> 13:25.038
[phone ringing]

13:25.072 --> 13:27.440
- MMM. WHY, MRS. HENDERSON,

13:27.474 --> 13:30.944
I'M COLLECTING QUAIL EGGS
AS WE SPEAK.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.179
MM-HMM.

13:32.212 --> 13:33.246
- THE HOSTESS
WITH THE MOSTEST.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.048
- DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT THAT.

13:35.082 --> 13:36.349
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE FINE.
JUST LEAVE IT TO ME.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.485
- YOU'RE LOOKING GREAT,
UNCLE VIC.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.320
- MUST BE
THAT ANTI-AGING CREAM.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.355
COUPLE OF YEARS,
I'LL BE READY FOR HIGH SCHOOL.

13:42.389 --> 13:44.958
- NO, I WAS REFERRING
TO AN INNER GLOW.

13:44.992 --> 13:47.227
- OH, MICHAEL,
TO FINALLY BE ALONE,

13:47.260 --> 13:50.463
WITH A MAN YOU LOVE.
[sighs]

13:50.497 --> 13:53.934
WHAT AM I TELLING YOU FOR?
YOU KNOW.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.368
- YEAH, I KNOW.

13:55.402 --> 13:58.505
TO FINALLY BE ALONE,
WITH THE MAN YOU LOVE

13:58.538 --> 14:00.373
AND THE MOTHER YOU LOVE.

14:00.407 --> 14:03.410
- OH, NO. SHE'S NOT--
- I DIDN'T REALIZE

14:03.443 --> 14:05.545
WHAT A TREMENDOUS DEBT
I OWE YOU

14:05.578 --> 14:08.248
FOR TAKING A BULLET
FOR ME ALL THESE YEARS.

14:08.281 --> 14:11.251
- IF ONLY I'D KNOWN,
I NEVER WOULD HAVE LEFT.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.953
- NO, YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.621
THIS IS NOT YOUR PROBLEM.
IT'S MINE.

14:14.654 --> 14:16.223
SHE'S MY MOTHER,

14:16.256 --> 14:18.225
AND I JUST NEED
TO EXPLAIN TO HER

14:18.258 --> 14:20.427
THAT AS MUCH AS I LOVE HER,

14:20.460 --> 14:22.262
THERE HAVE TO BE BOUNDARIES.

14:22.295 --> 14:23.430
- YOU'RE GOING TO NEED MORE

14:23.463 --> 14:25.265
THAN BOUNDARIES
WITH YOUR MOTHER.

14:25.298 --> 14:28.201
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
A BORDER PATROL.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.639
- EVER READ THIS?

14:32.672 --> 14:33.907
- WHEN I WAS NINE.

14:33.941 --> 14:35.508
- YOU OUGHT TO TRY IT AGAIN.

14:35.542 --> 14:39.012
ESPECIALLY THE PART WHERE
HUCK FREES JIM FROM SLAVERY.

14:39.046 --> 14:41.114
HE KNOWS HE'S GOING AGAINST
EVERYTHING

14:41.148 --> 14:43.250
THAT SOCIETY AND RELIGION
HAVE TAUGHT HIM,

14:43.283 --> 14:45.118
THAT HE'LL BE CONDEMNED
TO HELL.

14:45.152 --> 14:48.088
BUT HE DOESN'T CARE.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.126
YOU'RE GOING TO BAIL TOO?

14:53.160 --> 14:56.129
- NO, FUCK, NO.

14:56.163 --> 14:57.597
IT'S JUST THAT MAYBE

14:57.630 --> 14:59.599
WE WENT TOO FAR
THE OTHER NIGHT.

14:59.632 --> 15:02.069
- THAT GUY WAS
A RAGING ASSHOLE.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.337
HE DESERVED TO GET THE SHIT
BEAT OUT OF HIM.

15:04.371 --> 15:06.273
- YEAH, I KNOW.

15:06.306 --> 15:09.943
BUT WHEN I TOLD BRIAN,
HE KIND OF--

15:09.977 --> 15:12.045
- WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU
TELLING OTHER PEOPLE FOR?

15:12.079 --> 15:14.314
POSSE BUSINESS
STAYS BETWEEN US.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.549
- COME ON,
HE'S MY BOYFRIEND.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.952
AND HE THINKS WHAT
WE'RE DOING IS CRAZY.

15:18.986 --> 15:21.154
- CRAZY?

15:21.188 --> 15:22.689
YOU WANT TO SEE CRAZY?

15:22.722 --> 15:24.958
- A MAN WHO LIES WITH A MAN

15:24.992 --> 15:29.462
WILL BURN IN HELL.

15:29.496 --> 15:32.099
"THOU SHALT NOT LIE
WITH MANKIND,

15:32.132 --> 15:35.168
"AS WITH WOMANKIND.
IT IS...

15:35.202 --> 15:37.370
AN ABOMINATION."

15:37.404 --> 15:41.108
LEVITICUS, CHAPTER 18,
VERSE 22.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.176
I DIDN'T MAKE THIS UP, FOLKS.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.712
THIS IS GOD'S HOLY WORD.

15:45.745 --> 15:48.648
AND IF YOU ARE HERE TONIGHT,

15:48.681 --> 15:53.386
GUILTY OF THE SIN
OF HOMOSEXUALITY,

15:53.420 --> 15:55.722
THEN YOU ARE ON THAT BROAD
AND WINDING ROAD

15:55.755 --> 15:57.657
THAT LEADS
TO ETERNAL DAMNATION.

15:57.690 --> 15:59.059
all: AMEN!

15:59.092 --> 16:00.093
- PRAISE THE LORD.

16:00.127 --> 16:01.494
- AMEN.

16:01.528 --> 16:03.130
- DOES THIS GO ON
EVERY NIGHT?

16:03.163 --> 16:05.132
- JUST WEDNESDAY AND SUNDAY.

16:05.165 --> 16:07.067
IT'S HIS FAVORITE SUBJECT.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.336
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU EVEN COME HERE.

16:09.369 --> 16:11.471
- "KNOW THINE ENEMY."

16:11.504 --> 16:13.073
- IS THAT IN THE BIBLE?

16:13.106 --> 16:14.607
- IT'S IN THE FRONT OF MINE.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.076
- [shushes]

16:16.109 --> 16:18.111
- BECAUSE JESUS LOVES YOU,
MY CHILDREN.

16:18.145 --> 16:23.116
AND JESUS CAN CHANGE YOU.
- OH YES, HE CAN.

16:23.150 --> 16:26.686
- IT'S ALL RIGHT HERE,
IN GOD'S HOLY WORD.

16:26.719 --> 16:29.356
all: PRAISE JESUS.

16:29.389 --> 16:30.623
- SO WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.625
- YOUR SERMON WAS
AN INSPIRATION, PASTOR.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.294
- GIVE GOD THE GLORY.

16:34.327 --> 16:37.264
HE SPOKE RIGHT THROUGH ME
TONIGHT.

16:39.266 --> 16:40.633
IT WAS SO GOOD
TO HAVE YOU YOUNG MEN

16:40.667 --> 16:43.136
IN OUR SERVICE TONIGHT.

16:43.170 --> 16:45.305
- IT WAS VERY INSPIRING.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.240
- GIVE GOD THE GLORY.

16:47.274 --> 16:49.776
- MIND IF I ASK YOU A QUESTION,
PASTOR?

16:49.809 --> 16:51.544
- PLEASE.

16:51.578 --> 16:54.181
- THIS BOOK, YOU HAVE
TO BELIEVE ALL OF IT,

16:54.214 --> 16:57.117
NOT JUST SOME OF IT, RIGHT?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

16:57.150 --> 17:01.221
- SO DO YOU LIKE SHRIMP?

17:01.254 --> 17:02.689
- WELL, AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I DO.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.257
- BECAUSE IN LEVITICUS,

17:04.291 --> 17:06.259
A FEW SCRIPTURES
BEFORE THAT

17:06.293 --> 17:08.528
"MAN LYING WITH MAN
IS AN ABOMINATION" ONE,

17:08.561 --> 17:12.199
IT ALSO SAYS IT'S AN
ABOMINATION TO EAT SHELLFISH.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.667
AND SHRIMP
ARE SHELLFISH, RIGHT?

17:14.701 --> 17:16.603
- WHAT'S YOUR POINT,
YOUNG MAN?

17:16.636 --> 17:19.606
- I BELIEVE THE POINT IS,
IF YOU CAN EAT SHRIMP,

17:19.639 --> 17:22.642
WE CAN EAT COCK.

17:24.644 --> 17:27.314
- SON, YOU NEED THE LORD.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.216
YOU NEED TO ACCEPT JESUS.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.484
- OH, I ACCEPT JESUS.

17:31.518 --> 17:34.354
IT'S ASSHOLES LIKE YOU
I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH.

17:34.387 --> 17:37.090
[pats back]

17:43.863 --> 17:47.100
- I WANT THE FULL COLOR COMPS
ON MY DESK

17:47.134 --> 17:48.768
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING,

17:48.801 --> 17:50.837
AND SET UP A CONFERENCE CALL
WITH REMSON FOR 10:00

17:50.870 --> 17:54.174
SO THAT HE CAN SIGN OFF.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.575
WHEN IT'S YOUR OWN BUSINESS,

17:55.608 --> 17:58.611
THE SIGN ON THE DOOR SAYS
"WE NEVER CLOSE."

17:58.645 --> 17:59.879
COME TO THINK OF IT,
THAT'S WHAT IT USED TO SAY

17:59.912 --> 18:02.515
ON THE OLD BATHHOUSE DOOR.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.317
IT'S YOUR SHOT.

18:04.351 --> 18:07.220
- MMM.

18:11.224 --> 18:12.792
- [chuckles]
- SHIT.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.594
- OFF YOUR GAME?

18:14.627 --> 18:17.130
- WAITING FOR THE SOCIAL WORKER
TO ARRIVE IS MAKING ME NUTS.

18:17.164 --> 18:18.865
- YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

18:18.898 --> 18:20.367
YOU AND THE PROFESSOR ARE

18:20.400 --> 18:22.602
THE WORLD'S GREATEST
FOSTER PARENTS.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.271
- THANKS, BRIAN.

18:24.304 --> 18:28.208
- BESIDES, WHO ELSE WOULD WANT
THE LITTLE FUCKER?

18:28.241 --> 18:29.876
- MICHAEL, BRIAN,

18:29.909 --> 18:30.910
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET KENT.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.745
- TRENT.
- UH, TRENT.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.414
WOULD YOU, UM,
MIND EXCUSING US

18:34.447 --> 18:36.749
FOR JUST A NANOSECOND
WHILE I TALK WITH BRIAN?

18:36.783 --> 18:38.885
- SURE.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.487
- BRIAN,

18:40.520 --> 18:42.555
UM, I'M KIND OF IN A SPOT.

18:42.589 --> 18:45.525
SEE, UH, TRENT--UH, KENT,

18:45.558 --> 18:48.228
IS THIS, UM, THIS REALLY
INTERESTING PERSON.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.662
VERY DEEP.

18:49.696 --> 18:51.498
- [chuckles]
I BET.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.300
- AND, UH, I CAN'T TAKE HIM BACK
TO MEL AND LINZ'S.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.901
WOULDN'T BE KOSHER.

18:54.934 --> 18:57.404
- GUESS YOU'LL HAVE TO DIP
THE DILL SOMEWHERE ELSE.

18:57.437 --> 18:59.406
- SO I WAS, UM, WONDERING--

18:59.439 --> 19:01.208
AND I KNOW THIS
IS A REALLY HUGE FAVOR

19:01.241 --> 19:03.310
FOR WHICH I'D BE
ETERNALLY GRATEFUL,

19:03.343 --> 19:06.246
IF, UH, I COULD
USE YOUR PLACE,

19:06.279 --> 19:09.249
JUST FOR AN HOUR?

19:09.282 --> 19:10.250
HALF AN HOUR?

19:10.283 --> 19:13.420
TEN MINUTES, TOPS?

19:13.453 --> 19:15.788
NO? OKAY.
UM, WELL, UH,

19:15.822 --> 19:17.924
DON'T WORRY ABOUT US,
WE'LL BE FINE. OKAY. BYE.

19:17.957 --> 19:19.926
[phone ringing]

19:19.959 --> 19:22.662
- SO HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT WILDERNESS ADVENTURE?

19:22.695 --> 19:24.931
- WHAT'S UP?

19:24.964 --> 19:26.566
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IT DIDN'T GET THERE?

19:26.599 --> 19:29.602
THEY WERE SUPPOSED
TO TRANSFER IT THIS MORNING.

19:29.636 --> 19:32.939
WELL, CALL WERTSHAFTER
AND TELL HIM TO--

19:32.972 --> 19:36.343
WHAT?

19:36.376 --> 19:37.577
SHIT.

19:37.610 --> 19:38.678
FUCK!

19:38.711 --> 19:40.480
- GOOD NEWS, DEAR?

19:40.513 --> 19:41.948
- THE GODDAMN ACCOUNTANT
WAS SUPPOSED TO WIRE THE MONEY

19:41.981 --> 19:43.850
FOR THE ENDOVIR ADS TO HEAT,

19:43.883 --> 19:45.752
BUT IT NEVER ARRIVED.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.820
- CALL HIM IN THE MORNING AND
HAVE HIM STRAIGHTEN IT OUT.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.289
- THEY'RE OUT OF THE OFFICE
UNTIL MONDAY,

19:49.322 --> 19:51.691
AND THE DEADLINE'S
TOMORROW NIGHT.

19:51.724 --> 19:54.427
I'M GOING TO LOSE
MY ONE BIG ACCOUNT.

19:54.461 --> 19:56.296
I'M GOING TO GET SO FUCKED.

19:56.329 --> 19:58.965
- YOU AND ME BOTH, HONEY.

19:58.998 --> 20:00.500
- WAIT A MINUTE.

20:00.533 --> 20:03.703
WERTSHAFTER'S
YOUR ACCOUNTANT?

20:03.736 --> 20:06.639
YOU KNOW WHO USED TO WORK
FOR WERTSHAFTER?

20:09.876 --> 20:12.379
- I'M TED.
I'M A CRYSTAL METH ADDICT.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.314
all: HI, TED.

20:14.347 --> 20:17.317
- THIS IS MY SIXTH WEEK
OF RECOVERY.

20:17.350 --> 20:19.652
UH, I GUESS IT ALL STARTED,

20:19.686 --> 20:21.354
I'D SAY,
ABOUT A YEAR AGO OR SO.

20:21.388 --> 20:22.589
I WAS STRUGGLING
WITH FEELINGS

20:22.622 --> 20:24.857
OF WORTHLESSNESS
AND DEPRESSION;

20:24.891 --> 20:26.859
NO LONGER HAD THE WILL
TO GO ON.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.896
SO IN A MOMENT OF DESPAIR,
I DECIDED TO TRY WHAT'S--

20:29.929 --> 20:32.399
- COME ON, I NEED YOU.

20:32.432 --> 20:36.336
- JESUS, BRIAN,
CAN YOU SEE I'M SHARING?

20:36.369 --> 20:38.405
- IT'S NOTHING YOU HAVEN'T
HEARD BEFORE.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.039
DID DRUGS, FUCKED AROUND.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.409
HIT BOTTOM.
REGRETS IT DEEPLY.

20:42.442 --> 20:44.010
LET'S GO.
- I--

20:44.043 --> 20:45.745
NO, MY COUNSELOR SAID
I'M SUPPOSED--

20:45.778 --> 20:47.347
- SHUT UP, LET'S GO.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.048
- HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

20:49.081 --> 20:51.484
THE RULE IS YOU NEVER INTERRUPT
SOMEONE WHEN THEY'RE SHARING.

20:51.518 --> 20:52.885
- IT'S NOT MY CLUB.
IT'S NOT MY RULES.

20:52.919 --> 20:56.556
- YOU ARE UN-FUCKING-
BELIEVABLE!

20:56.589 --> 20:58.057
WHY DO I FEEL LIKE
I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE?

20:58.090 --> 21:00.026
- DROP TO YOUR KNEES AND
IMAGINE A COCK IN YOUR MOUTH,

21:00.059 --> 21:02.995
IT'LL COME TO YOU.

21:04.797 --> 21:05.898
HERE'S THE DEAL.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.967
MY IDIOT ACCOUNTANT,

21:08.000 --> 21:10.303
THE SAME DICK THAT FIRED
YOUR ASS FOR JACKING OFF

21:10.337 --> 21:11.838
AT YOUR COMPUTER...
- WERTSHAFTER?

21:11.871 --> 21:14.507
- HE WAS SUPPOSED TO TRANSFER
20 GRAND FROM MY ACCOUNT

21:14.541 --> 21:15.942
INTO HEAT MAGAZINE'S ACCOUNT,

21:15.975 --> 21:17.644
BUT THEY FUCKED IT UP.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.312
- AS IF I'M SURPRISED.

21:19.346 --> 21:20.647
WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO ABOUT IT?

21:20.680 --> 21:21.848
- FIND IT AND FIX IT

21:21.881 --> 21:23.850
AND GET IT TO THEM
BY MIDNIGHT.

21:23.883 --> 21:26.085
- BY MIDNIGHT?
- OR SOONER.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.920
- AH, A SIMPLE ENOUGH REQUEST.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.522
ONLY, I CAN'T DO IT.
I'M OUT OF SHAPE.

21:29.556 --> 21:31.324
I HAVEN'T CRUNCHED A NUMBER
IN YEARS.

21:31.358 --> 21:32.925
BESIDES, I'M A SINGER NOW.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.427
YOU WANT TO HEAR MANRICO'S ARIA
FROM IL TROVATORE?

21:34.461 --> 21:35.595
FINE.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.530
* DI QUELLA PIRA *

21:37.564 --> 21:38.798
- LISTEN TO ME.

21:38.831 --> 21:40.833
ARE YOU LISTENING?
- I'M LISTENING.

21:40.867 --> 21:42.569
- YOU MAY BE A PATHETIC
DRUG ADDICT

21:42.602 --> 21:44.437
WHO'S LOST EVERYTHING--
YOUR DIGNITY,

21:44.471 --> 21:47.474
YOUR LIVELIHOOD, YOUR LOVER,
YOUR GOOD NAME,

21:47.507 --> 21:49.342
THE RESPECT AND TRUST
OF EVERYONE YOU KNOW...

21:49.376 --> 21:50.977
- NO ONE GIVES A PEP TALK
LIKE YOU, BRI.

21:51.010 --> 21:53.813
- BUT THERE'S ONE THING
YOU HAVEN'T LOST.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.815
YOU'RE STILL AN ACCOUNTANT.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.450
THAT'S WHO YOU ARE.

21:57.484 --> 21:59.986
NOT EVEN THE LOWEST FORM
OF DEGRADATION

22:00.019 --> 22:02.121
CAN TAKE THAT AWAY FROM YOU.

22:02.154 --> 22:06.493
NOW, "LET'S LIVE IN THE
SOLUTION, NOT IN THE PROBLEM."

22:09.462 --> 22:11.764
- [sighs]

22:11.798 --> 22:13.966
- SORRY I'M LATE.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.135
I WAS IN THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE
FOREVER.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.137
SEEMS EVERY WOMAN
IN PITTSBURGH'S PREGNANT,

22:18.170 --> 22:20.006
INCLUDING MY OBSTETRICIAN.

22:20.039 --> 22:21.974
- MEL, I HAVE SOME NEWS--
- I WAS UP HALF THE NIGHT

22:22.008 --> 22:23.443
FINISHING MY FINAL ARGUMENT.

22:23.476 --> 22:25.378
DID A DAMN GOOD JOB
IF I DO SAY SO,

22:25.412 --> 22:27.580
BUT, HEY, I'LL LET YOU
BE THE JUDGE.

22:27.614 --> 22:29.516
- WELL FIRST, WOULD YOU LET ME
GET A WORD IN?

22:29.549 --> 22:31.518
- SURE, LARRY.
WHAT'S UP?

22:31.551 --> 22:33.119
- THEY'RE REPLACING
JUDGE MCNALLY

22:33.152 --> 22:35.788
ON THE ARLEN VERSUS ARLEN CASE.

22:35.822 --> 22:37.590
- WITH WHOM?

22:37.624 --> 22:39.492
- JUDGE RANDALL WALKER.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.861
- ISN'T HE THE ONE WHO
UPHELD THE FIRING

22:41.894 --> 22:43.596
OF THAT GAY
ELEMENTARY TEACHER?

22:43.630 --> 22:46.599
- THAT'S OUR BOY.
- THAT'S TOO BAD.

22:46.633 --> 22:50.470
- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A REAL
UPHILL BATTLE ON OUR HANDS.

22:50.503 --> 22:52.539
IT DOESN'T MEAN
WE STILL CAN'T WIN.

22:52.572 --> 22:54.040
WE JUST HAVE TO REWORK
OUR ARGUMENT,

22:54.073 --> 22:55.742
EMPHASIZE THAT
THE PREVIOUS JUDGE

22:55.775 --> 22:57.544
INCORRECTLY APPLIED THE LAW,
AND THAT'S WHY

22:57.577 --> 23:00.012
WE'RE SEEKING A PROPER
LEGAL DETERMINATION.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.949
BESIDES, JEANETTE AND ANNA
ARE COUNTING ON ME.

23:02.982 --> 23:07.487
I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF LETTING THEM DOWN.

23:07.520 --> 23:10.490
[music on TV]

23:10.523 --> 23:18.465

23:19.832 --> 23:21.501

23:21.534 --> 23:23.169
I JUST LOVE
SOME LIKE IT HOT.

23:23.202 --> 23:25.037
I COULD WATCH IT OVER AND
OVER AND OVER.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.506
- WE HAVE.

23:26.539 --> 23:28.207
- SO WHO'S UP FOR
ALL ABOUT EVE?

23:28.240 --> 23:30.510
- I HAVE SOME WRITING
I NEED TO FINISH.

23:30.543 --> 23:32.645
- YEAH, AND--AND HUNTER
HAS HOMEWORK TO DO.

23:32.679 --> 23:33.980
- I DON'T MIND.

23:34.013 --> 23:36.082
- OH, THERE'S ALWAYS TIME
FOR BETTE DAVIS.

23:36.115 --> 23:37.650
- WHO'S BETTE DAVIS?

23:37.684 --> 23:40.520
- "WHO'S BETTE DAVIS?"

23:40.553 --> 23:42.689
THIS KID NEEDS
A REAL EDUCATION, MIKE.

23:42.722 --> 23:45.658
- "HOMOPIECE THEATER"
IS OVER FOR THIS EVENING.

23:45.692 --> 23:47.460
GO ON.
- ALL RIGHT.

23:47.494 --> 23:49.529
YOU BOYS GO DO WHATEVER IT IS
YOU NEED TO DO.

23:49.562 --> 23:52.565
I'LL JUST SIT HERE
AND PLAY SOLITAIRE.

23:58.638 --> 24:01.541
- MA, UH, UNCLE VIC
AND I WERE TALKING, AND--

24:01.574 --> 24:02.742
- YOU AND VIC?

24:02.775 --> 24:04.811
OH.

24:04.844 --> 24:06.679
- ALL ABOUT YOU.

24:06.713 --> 24:10.617
AND I KNOW YOU MUST
FEEL LONELY...

24:10.650 --> 24:14.220
BECAUSE HE'S GONE, BUT, UH...

24:14.253 --> 24:15.955
YOU CAN'T KEEP
COMING OVER HERE.

24:15.988 --> 24:18.558
YOU'VE GOT TO FIND SOME THINGS
TO DO ON YOUR OWN,

24:18.591 --> 24:21.528
YOU KNOW, WITH SOME FRIENDS
OF YOUR OWN.

24:25.131 --> 24:28.768
- WELL, I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU
AND MY BROTHER KNOW HOW I FEEL,

24:28.801 --> 24:30.503
AND WHAT I SHOULD BE DOING.

24:30.537 --> 24:33.906
- IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA
TO BROADEN YOUR HORIZONS.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.274
- I'M BROAD ENOUGH, THANKS.

24:35.307 --> 24:36.743
- DEBBIE, IT WASN'T MEANT
AS A CRITICISM.

24:36.776 --> 24:38.110
- WELL, IT SOUNDED LIKE ONE.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.579
- WELL, DON'T TAKE IT OUT
ON BEN.

24:39.612 --> 24:40.647
HE WAS JUST MAKING
A SUGGESTION.

24:40.680 --> 24:41.781
- WELL, FINE.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.015
AND I'LL MAKE ONE TO YOU:

24:43.049 --> 24:46.185
M.Y.O.B.!

24:46.218 --> 24:47.987
AND YOU'VE GOT A HELL OF
A NERVE, YOU KNOW,

AFTER I-I DO YOUR LAUNDRY
AND I MAKE YOUR DINNER.

24:50.289 --> 24:52.124
- YOU WANT TO SPRAY
FOR TERMITES TOO?

24:52.158 --> 24:54.594
- DON'T YOU OPEN A MOUTH TO ME,
YOUNG MAN.

24:54.627 --> 24:56.996
AND YOU'RE NOT SO YOUNG.

24:57.029 --> 24:58.731
YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH TO SHOW ME
A LITTLE RESPECT.

24:58.765 --> 25:00.166
- I DO SHOW RESPECT!

25:00.199 --> 25:01.801
- BY TELLING YOUR OWN MOTHER

25:01.834 --> 25:03.135
THAT SHE'S NOT WELCOME
IN YOUR HOUSE?

25:03.169 --> 25:05.772
- I NEVER SAID THAT.
- HE NEVER SAID THAT.

25:05.805 --> 25:10.142
- WELL,"YOU CAN'T KEEP
COMING OVER HERE"?

25:10.176 --> 25:12.311
WELL, HOW'D YOU LIKE IT
IF I SAID THAT TO YOU?

25:12.344 --> 25:13.813
"GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!"

25:13.846 --> 25:15.682
AND BELIEVE ME,
THERE WERE PLENTY OF TIMES

25:15.715 --> 25:16.883
WHEN I WANTED TO DO IT,
WHEN I COULD'VE USED

25:16.916 --> 25:18.818
A LITTLE FUCKIN'
PEACE AND QUIET.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.186

- YOU KEEP THE FUCK
OUT OF THIS.

25:23.990 --> 25:26.025
[knock at door]
BUT I DIDN'T DO IT,

25:26.058 --> 25:27.293
BECAUSE A MOTHER'S LOVE
KNOWS NO BOUNDS.

25:27.326 --> 25:29.028
- WELL, I WISH IT WOULD.

25:29.061 --> 25:30.096
- SO WHAT, YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE
ONE OF THOSE MOTHERS

25:30.129 --> 25:31.297
WHO DOESN'T GIVE A CRAP?

25:31.330 --> 25:32.832
- WELL, I CAN DREAM,
CAN'T I?

25:32.865 --> 25:34.634
- WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO BE,

25:34.667 --> 25:36.335
SOME WISE-ASS COMMENT?

25:36.368 --> 25:39.038
- I'M CONSTANCE SIMMONS
FROM SOCIAL SERVICES.

25:39.071 --> 25:41.040
ARE MR. BRUCKNER AND
MR. NOVOTNY AT HOME?

25:41.073 --> 25:42.642
- JUST BECAUSE I'M YOUR SON...
- OH, SHIT.

25:42.675 --> 25:43.810
- IT DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE RIGHT
TO BARGE IN HERE

25:43.843 --> 25:45.111
ANYTIME YOU WANT.

25:45.144 --> 25:46.679
- WOULD YOU TWO TAKE IT
OUT ON THE STREET?

25:46.713 --> 25:48.214
- COME IN.

25:48.247 --> 25:50.049
- WELL, MAYBE YOU DON'T
FUCKING REMEMBER

25:50.082 --> 25:52.218
THAT I RAISED YOU
ALL BY MYSELF,

25:52.251 --> 25:53.786
WITH NO FUCKING HELP
FROM ANYONE!

25:53.820 --> 25:55.588
- HOW COULD I NOT
FUCKING REMEMBER?

25:55.622 --> 25:57.323
YOU NEVER LET ME
FUCKING FORGET IT!

25:57.356 --> 26:00.226
- GUYS?

26:00.259 --> 26:04.330
THAT'S MR. BRUCKNER
AND THAT'S MR. NOVOTNY.

IT'S AS GOOD AS THERE.

26:43.770 --> 26:46.138
- NO, IT'S NOT!

26:46.172 --> 26:47.974
- DO YOU WANT
TO MAKE A LIAR OUT OF ME?

26:48.007 --> 26:49.776
- LOOK, I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO HAVE ANY STRESS IN MY LIFE.

26:49.809 --> 26:51.377
MY PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY STATES
THAT--

26:51.410 --> 26:53.112
- THAT WITH DIVINE POWER

26:53.145 --> 26:54.413
AND THE THREAT
OF IMMINENT DEATH,

26:54.446 --> 26:57.616
YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING.

27:00.452 --> 27:01.988
- LET'S SEE, UH,

THE LAST PASSWORD HE USED

27:03.422 --> 27:05.792
WAS HIS DAUGHTER'S BIRTHDAY,
IT WAS 9-15-74.

27:05.825 --> 27:07.126
[computer buzzes]

27:07.159 --> 27:09.395

- [shushes]

28:14.126 --> 28:16.328
FUCK ME.

28:16.362 --> 28:18.330
- [howls]

28:18.364 --> 28:21.200
[both gasp]

28:21.233 --> 28:23.803
- [howl continues]

28:23.836 --> 28:26.973
[distant howling]

28:33.846 --> 28:36.348
- YOU WERE FUCKING AMAZING.

28:36.382 --> 28:40.219
- YEAH, I WAS PRETTY GOOD,
WASN'T I?

28:40.252 --> 28:41.954
- THE WAY YOU WERE
GOING AT IT,

28:41.988 --> 28:44.023
THERE WAS NO STOPPING YOU.

28:44.056 --> 28:46.492
- WELL, ONCE I FIGURED OUT
WHERE THE MISTAKE WAS,

28:46.525 --> 28:48.227
YOU KNOW, THEY TOOK THE MONEY
FROM YOUR ACCOUNT,

28:48.260 --> 28:50.029
PUT IT INTO THEIR ACCOUNT,

28:50.062 --> 28:51.430
BUT NEVER SENT IT ON
TO HEAT MAGAZINE'S ACCOUNT

28:51.463 --> 28:53.099
BEFORE THEY LEFT
FOR THE WEEKEND...

28:53.132 --> 28:54.366
- ASSHOLES.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.968
- YEAH, IT WAS EASY ENOUGH
TO FINISH

28:56.002 --> 28:57.970
THE TRANSFER IN TIME
TO MEET THE DEADLINE.

28:58.004 --> 28:59.238
- IT WAS GENIUS.

28:59.271 --> 29:01.941
SHEER GENIUS.

29:01.974 --> 29:03.375
- NOTHING ANY CONSCIENTIOUS
ACCOUNTANT

29:03.409 --> 29:05.978
WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF THE SYSTEM
COULDN'T HAVE DONE.

29:06.012 --> 29:08.848
- BUT IT WAS YOU,
THEODORE SCHMIDT,

29:08.881 --> 29:12.384
WHO DID IT.
- YEAH.

29:12.418 --> 29:15.187
- YOU CAN KEEP ON DOING IT,
STARTING MONDAY MORNING.

29:18.224 --> 29:19.926
- ARE YOU SAYING--

29:19.959 --> 29:23.796
- I WANT YOU TO COME
AND WORK FOR ME.

29:23.830 --> 29:26.132
- JESUS, BRIAN, I--

29:26.165 --> 29:28.801
I NEVER DREAMED THAT YOU,
OF ALL PEOPLE,

29:28.835 --> 29:31.270
WOULD EVER ASK ME,
OF ALL PEOPLE.

29:31.303 --> 29:34.941
- THAT MAKES TWO OF US.

29:34.974 --> 29:37.409
- I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH
YOUR OFFER MEANS TO ME.

29:37.443 --> 29:41.413
- THEN DON'T.
JUST SAY YES.

29:41.447 --> 29:42.548
- I--

29:42.581 --> 29:44.016
- WILL?

29:44.050 --> 29:45.351
- I--

29:45.384 --> 29:48.821
- ACCEPT?

29:48.855 --> 29:52.091
- I...CAN'T.

29:52.124 --> 29:55.061
I'M NOT READY.
I'M SORRY.

29:57.063 --> 29:59.498
- [chuckles]
- MM-MM.

30:03.202 --> 30:04.971
- OATMEAL?

30:05.004 --> 30:07.373
- NO, THANKS.
NOT HUNGRY.

30:07.406 --> 30:09.108
- DOUGHNUT?

30:09.141 --> 30:12.611
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU CONVINCED ME.

30:12.644 --> 30:15.447
- SO, HOW'D YOU SLEEP?

30:15.481 --> 30:18.918
- LIKE A BABY. YOU?

30:18.951 --> 30:21.353
- GREAT--

30:21.387 --> 30:25.191
EXCEPT FOR
THIS TERRIBLE HOWLING.

30:25.224 --> 30:26.993
- UH, LINZ, I CAN EXPLAIN.

30:27.026 --> 30:28.527
- NO NEED. WE HEARD.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.462
LOUD AND CLEAR.

30:30.496 --> 30:33.866
- BELIEVE ME, I HAD NO IDEA
I BROUGHT HOME THE WOLFMAN.

30:33.900 --> 30:36.068
- I THOUGHT WE MADE
AN AGREEMENT.

30:36.102 --> 30:39.071
- AND I BROKE IT.

30:39.105 --> 30:40.606
IT'S JUST,
THERE WAS THIS MONSOON,

30:40.639 --> 30:43.609
AND-AND WE DIDN'T HAVE
ANY PLACE--

30:43.642 --> 30:46.012
UM, UH, NO EXCUSE.

30:46.045 --> 30:47.613
I-I PROMISE
I'LL NEVER DO IT AGAIN.

30:47.646 --> 30:49.415
- I HOPE YOU'LL DO IT AGAIN.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.083
JUST NOT HERE.

30:51.117 --> 30:54.086
- THE PROBLEM IS, WHERE?

30:54.120 --> 30:57.089
- THE SOLUTION'S PRETTY SIMPLE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

30:57.123 --> 31:00.359
- MY OWN PLACE.

31:00.392 --> 31:03.129
IT'S JUST I'VE NEVER
LIVED ALONE BEFORE.

31:03.162 --> 31:05.264
I MEAN, AFTER I LEFT HAZELHURST,
I CAME UP HERE,

31:05.297 --> 31:06.966
AND I LIVED WITH GODIVA,
THEN MICHAEL,

31:06.999 --> 31:09.368
THEN TEDDY,
NOW YOU AND MEL.

31:09.401 --> 31:11.503
- SO MAYBE IT'S TIME.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.239
WHO KNOWS, YOU MIGHT EVEN
LIKE IT,

31:13.272 --> 31:14.907
BEING ABLE TO COME AND GO...

31:14.941 --> 31:18.244
- AND COME.
- AS YOU PLEASE.

31:18.277 --> 31:20.947
[chuckles]

31:24.283 --> 31:27.519
- IF MEL SAYS IT'S GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT,

31:27.553 --> 31:30.022
IT'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

31:30.056 --> 31:33.392
- BUT AFTER WHAT YOU JUST
TOLD US ABOUT THIS NEW JUDGE--

31:33.425 --> 31:35.027
- LOOK, THERE'S NO DENYING

31:35.061 --> 31:36.695
WE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL HURDLE
TO OVERCOME.

31:36.728 --> 31:39.665
BUT IT'S NOT INSURMOUNTABLE.

31:39.698 --> 31:42.034
BESIDES, YOU KNOW
AS WELL AS I DO

31:42.068 --> 31:45.671
THAT NO VICTORY WORTH WINNING
EVER COMES EASILY.

31:45.704 --> 31:47.406
- THANK YOU, MEL.

31:47.439 --> 31:49.308
- WE'RE GOING
TO GET THROUGH THIS

31:49.341 --> 31:51.277
AS LONG AS WE STICK TOGETHER
AND STAY STRONG.

31:51.310 --> 31:52.945
[knock at door]

31:52.979 --> 31:54.413
- SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
BUT IF YOU HAVE A MINUTE--

31:54.446 --> 31:57.249
- WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME?
- YEAH.

31:59.718 --> 32:02.121
- WOULD YOU AT LEAST LISTEN
TO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY?

32:02.154 --> 32:03.089
- I HEARD WHAT
YOU HAD TO SAY.

32:03.122 --> 32:04.957
THE ANSWER IS NO FUCKING WAY.

32:04.991 --> 32:07.026
- YOU READ WALKER'S RECORD.
HE'S IN THE DARK AGES.

32:07.059 --> 32:08.560
- THEN WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO ENLIGHTEN HIM.

32:08.594 --> 32:10.162
- YOU KNOW GODDAMN WELL
WHAT I'M SAYING

32:10.196 --> 32:11.597
IS BEST FOR THE CASE
AND THE CLIENT.

32:11.630 --> 32:13.232
- YOU TAKING OVER.

32:13.265 --> 32:15.201
- AT LEAST I'M SOMEONE
HE CAN RELATE TO.

32:15.234 --> 32:17.369
- A STRAIGHT WHITE MALE.

32:17.403 --> 32:20.973
- MEL, WE HAVE AN UNFRIENDLY
JUDGE, A GAY MOTHER,

32:21.007 --> 32:23.109
AND LOOK WHO'S DEFENDING HER:
A PREGNANT LESBIAN.

32:23.142 --> 32:24.376
- EXACTLY.
WHO KNOWS BETTER

32:24.410 --> 32:26.178
WHAT SHE'S GOING THROUGH
THAN I DO?

32:26.212 --> 32:29.715
- THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE
TO BE THE ONE TO SAY IT.

32:29.748 --> 32:32.351
AND RIGHT NOW, WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO TAKE THAT RISK.

32:32.384 --> 32:34.120
- OH, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
I'M A RISK.

32:34.153 --> 32:36.755
WELL, IF YOU THINK I WORKED
DAY AND NIGHT FOR MONTHS,

32:36.788 --> 32:38.590
POURING MY GUTS
INTO THIS CASE,

32:38.624 --> 32:40.492
ONLY TO SEE IT TAKEN AWAY
BY ONE OF THE BOYS--

32:40.526 --> 32:42.328
- I AM NOT TRYING
TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM YOU.

32:42.361 --> 32:44.063
THIS WILL STILL BE YOUR CASE.

32:44.096 --> 32:45.231
YOUR WORK WILL STILL BE THERE.

32:45.264 --> 32:46.598
YOU WILL STILL BE THERE.

32:46.632 --> 32:49.535
- SITTING BEHIND YOU?

32:49.568 --> 32:51.737
SORRY, LARRY.
NO WAY.

32:51.770 --> 32:54.273
AND GIVEN THE CONFIDENCE
AND SUPPORT OF MY CLIENTS,

32:54.306 --> 32:57.243
THERE'S NO WAY
THEY'D ALLOW IT EITHER.

33:00.579 --> 33:03.549

33:19.165 --> 33:20.499
- YEAH.
- YOU WANT WINE?

33:20.532 --> 33:21.667
I WANT WINE.

33:21.700 --> 33:24.236

33:35.414 --> 33:36.715
[cheers and applause]

33:36.748 --> 33:39.651
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

33:39.685 --> 33:41.320
- HEY, PAVAROTTI.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.255
I'M STILL WAITING
FOR MY EXTRA ALFREDO SAUCE.

33:43.289 --> 33:44.656
- OH, COMING RIGHT UP, SIR.
SORRY.

33:44.690 --> 33:46.558
- AND I NEVER GOT
MY SIDE SALAD.

33:46.592 --> 33:47.793
- COMING RIGHT UP, MADAME.

33:47.826 --> 33:49.395
- I UNDERSTAND THAT,
MA'AM,

33:49.428 --> 33:50.829
BUT YOU SHOULD'VE REQUESTED
SEPARATE CHECKS

33:50.862 --> 33:52.598
BEFORE YOU PLACED THE ORDER.

33:52.631 --> 33:54.266
- NOBODY TOLD US THAT.

33:54.300 --> 33:55.601
OH, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD,
HOW ARE WE EVER

33:55.634 --> 33:57.336
GOING TO FIGURE THIS OUT?

33:57.369 --> 33:58.804
- I WANT TO SEE THE MANAGER.

33:58.837 --> 34:00.672
- PERHAPS I CAN BE
OF ASSISTANCE.

34:00.706 --> 34:02.508
UH, WHO HAD THE LASAGNA?

34:02.541 --> 34:05.344
- I DID, AND I HAD A GLASS
OF CHIANTI.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.213
- MAKE THAT TWO.

34:07.246 --> 34:09.481
- SHE ONLY HAD WATER.

34:09.515 --> 34:11.317
AND--AND WE'RE SPLITTING
IDA'S.

34:11.350 --> 34:12.684
- SHE'S THE BIRTHDAY GIRL.

34:12.718 --> 34:14.220
- OH, HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

34:14.253 --> 34:16.188
- OH, HOW SWEET, DEAR.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

34:16.222 --> 34:18.290
- SHE HAD THE SCAMPI
AND THE ICED TEA.

34:18.324 --> 34:21.593
- AND WE ALL SPLIT
A CAESAR SALAD, DON'T FORGET.

34:21.627 --> 34:23.695
AND AN ORDER
OF FRIED CALAMARI.

34:23.729 --> 34:25.297
[overlapping chatter]

34:25.331 --> 34:28.234
- OKAY, SO THAT'S
$14.73 FOR YOU.

34:28.267 --> 34:29.601
INCLUDES TAX AND TIP.

34:29.635 --> 34:31.570
AND WHO HAD THE VEAL PARMESAN?
- ME, DEAR.

34:31.603 --> 34:33.305
- OKAY, YOU OWE
$5 FOR THE BIRTHDAY GIRL,

34:33.339 --> 34:36.575
AND $10 FOR YOURSELF,
SO YOUR GRAND TOTAL IS $18.45,

34:36.608 --> 34:37.709
WHICH LEAVES YOU
WITH THE LINGUINI

34:37.743 --> 34:39.645
AND 80 CENTS, ADD 15%,

34:39.678 --> 34:41.880
BRINGS IT TO $13.63.

34:41.913 --> 34:44.850
[pleased chatter]

34:44.883 --> 34:46.385
- HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

34:46.418 --> 34:47.853
- THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
YOU'RE TOO KIND.

34:47.886 --> 34:49.755
- YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT
A NICE VOICE, YOUNG MAN.

34:49.788 --> 34:52.591
BUT IF YOU ASK ME, YOU
SHOULD'VE BEEN AN ACCOUNTANT.

34:52.624 --> 34:53.759
IT'S IN YOUR BLOOD.

34:53.792 --> 34:58.497
[overlapping chatter]

35:00.899 --> 35:04.270
- WELL, IT WAS NICE,
WHILE IT LASTED.

35:04.303 --> 35:07.373
- LOOK, WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
FOR CERTAIN.

35:07.406 --> 35:09.341
- YEAH, WE DO.

35:09.375 --> 35:10.909
THE LOOK ON MISS SIMMONS' FACE
SAID IT ALL.

35:10.942 --> 35:13.812
"GET THAT KID AWAY FROM THOSE
CRAZY PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY."

35:13.845 --> 35:14.913
- YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE
TO WHISPER.

35:14.946 --> 35:18.116
I HAVE 20-20 HEARING.

35:22.588 --> 35:24.623
THINK SHE'LL TAKE ME
WITH HER TONIGHT?

35:24.656 --> 35:26.225
- SHE CAN'T DO THAT.

35:26.258 --> 35:27.693
- THEY CAN DO ANYTHING
THEY DAMN WELL PLEASE.

35:27.726 --> 35:29.295
[knock at door]

35:29.328 --> 35:31.697
- GETTING MORE UPSET
ISN'T GOING TO HELP.

35:31.730 --> 35:35.834
- RIGHT.
I'LL GET LESS UPSET.

35:35.867 --> 35:37.903
- HEY, BEN.

35:37.936 --> 35:39.505
- JESUS, MA.

35:39.538 --> 35:40.906
- IF YOU WANT TO SLAM THE DOOR
IN MY FACE,

35:40.939 --> 35:42.374
I'LL UNDERSTAND.

35:42.408 --> 35:44.410
- GOOD.
- HEY, HEY.

35:44.443 --> 35:47.413
COME IN, DEBBIE.

35:49.715 --> 35:52.384
- LOOK, I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO EAT ALL DAY,

35:52.418 --> 35:53.819
NOT EVEN THE MAC AND CHEESE
AT THE DINER,

35:53.852 --> 35:56.655
WHICH IS MY FAVORITE.

35:56.688 --> 35:58.257
LOOK, IF I'VE DONE ANYTHING

35:58.290 --> 36:00.392
TO FUCK UP YOUR CHANCES
OF KEEPING THAT KID,

36:00.426 --> 36:02.228
I WILL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF.

36:02.261 --> 36:03.662
- THAT'LL MAKE TWO OF US.

36:03.695 --> 36:05.197
- IT'S NO MORE YOUR FAULT
THAN IT IS OURS.

36:05.231 --> 36:06.532
THINGS JUST GOT
A LITTLE OUT OF--

36:06.565 --> 36:09.201
[knock at door]

36:13.872 --> 36:15.741
- HELLO, MR. BRUCKNER.

36:15.774 --> 36:17.943
MR. NOVOTNY.

36:17.976 --> 36:19.811
MRS. NOVOTNY,
WHAT A SURPRISE.

36:19.845 --> 36:23.549
- HOPEFULLY NOT AS MUCH
AS LAST TIME.

36:23.582 --> 36:25.951
- MS. SIMMONS, I-I-I KNOW

36:25.984 --> 36:27.553
WHEN YOU WERE HERE
THE OTHER NIGHT,

36:27.586 --> 36:30.822
IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE HUNTER
BELONGED HERE.

36:30.856 --> 36:34.293
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW MUCH
BEN AND I CARE ABOUT HIM.

36:34.326 --> 36:38.697
AND WE KNOW WE WOULD BE
VERY GOOD FOSTER PARENTS,

36:38.730 --> 36:42.000
IF YOU JUST GIVE US A CHANCE.

36:42.033 --> 36:45.437
- OH, I AGREE.

36:45.471 --> 36:47.973
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
I HAVE A MOTHER TOO.

36:48.006 --> 36:50.242
WE'RE ALWAYS GOING
AT EACH OTHER.

36:50.276 --> 36:52.711
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
WE DON'T LOVE EACH OTHER.

36:52.744 --> 36:56.315
IN FACT, WE WOULDN'T FIGHT
SO MUCH IF WE DIDN'T.

36:56.348 --> 36:58.450
SO WHEN I COME ACROSS
WHAT I SAW HERE,

36:58.484 --> 36:59.985
I KNOW WHAT IT IS,

37:00.018 --> 37:03.455
'CAUSE IT'S NOT SOMETHING
I SEE VERY OFTEN.

37:03.489 --> 37:06.392
IT'S CALLED LOVE.

37:21.440 --> 37:25.611
- PUTTING IN LONG, HARD HOURS
IN YE OLDE STEAM ROOM?

37:25.644 --> 37:28.547
- NOT THE WAY I'D LIKE TO.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.888
- DOING YOUR OWN BOOKS,
I SEE.

37:36.922 --> 37:41.793
- AT LEAST IT'S SOMEONE
I CAN TRUST.

37:41.827 --> 37:43.495
- [clears throat]

37:43.529 --> 37:45.497
LOOK, UH, BRIAN,

37:45.531 --> 37:47.699
I'VE RECONSIDERED
YOUR OFFER,

37:47.733 --> 37:50.836
AND IF THE POSITION--

37:50.869 --> 37:53.372
MAKE THAT "OPPORTUNITY,"

37:53.405 --> 37:56.575
IS STILL AVAILABLE,
I'D LIKE TO TAKE YOU UP ON IT.

37:58.944 --> 38:01.046
- WHAT MADE YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND?

38:01.079 --> 38:04.816
- IDA FREEDMAN'S
80TH BIRTHDAY...

38:04.850 --> 38:06.518
AND THE ALBEIT OBVIOUS,

38:06.552 --> 38:08.554
BUT NONETHELESS BELATED,
REALIZATION

38:08.587 --> 38:11.590
THAT MY TRUE CALLING IS NOT
TO DECIMATE DONNA E MOBILE

38:11.623 --> 38:12.991
IN BETWEEN COURSES OF PASTA,

38:13.024 --> 38:15.060
BUT...

38:15.093 --> 38:20.666
