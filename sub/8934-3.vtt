WEBVTT

00:01.501 --> 00:02.068
This is the Evergreen

00:02.068 --> 00:03.803
This is the
Evergreen forest.

00:03.803 --> 00:05.772
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:07.741 --> 00:10.143
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.143 --> 00:12.078
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.346 --> 00:15.315
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:16.149 --> 00:17.450
Yikes!

00:17.951 --> 00:19.686
Yaaaah...

00:22.422 --> 00:23.757
Yeaaaah!

00:23.757 --> 00:26.559
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:34.167 --> 00:36.236
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:37.971 --> 00:39.305
Cyril Sneer!

00:42.742 --> 00:45.178
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:46.179 --> 00:47.514
the Raccoons!!

00:47.514 --> 00:49.816
♪ (show theme music) ♪

01:01.928 --> 01:05.698
Mr. Knox: I do
appreciate this, Mr. Sneer.

01:05.698 --> 01:08.735
Your looking after
my nephew Bonneville

01:08.735 --> 01:11.204
on such short notice.

01:11.204 --> 01:12.739
My pleasure, Knox.

01:12.739 --> 01:15.508
You and Lady Baden-Baden
have a good weekend.

01:15.508 --> 01:17.744
I want you all
rested up for Monday,

01:17.744 --> 01:20.113
eh, when we sign the big deal.

01:20.113 --> 01:22.415
Mr. Knox: Ah yes, uhm,

01:22.415 --> 01:24.217
the big deal.

01:24.217 --> 01:28.922
Now you have yourself a
real nice time, Bonneville!

01:28.922 --> 01:32.325
Oh, and mind your manners.

01:32.325 --> 01:34.327
Yes, uncle Knox.

01:35.795 --> 01:39.866
Yes, we'll put you in
the spare room beside Cedric.

01:44.437 --> 01:47.240
So Bonneville,
do you like money?

01:47.774 --> 01:48.908
I'm telling you, Cedric,

01:48.908 --> 01:52.278
this is going to be
the best expedition ever.

01:52.278 --> 01:53.413
He-he

01:53.413 --> 01:56.416
Tonight's the second
full moon of the month.

01:56.416 --> 01:58.718
The blue moon.

01:58.718 --> 02:01.154
Do you know how
often that happens, eh?

02:01.154 --> 02:03.156
Maybe once every ten years.

02:03.156 --> 02:06.159
Ya, and it's the
only time the moon shines

02:06.159 --> 02:08.128
on the quartz tower.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.763
Boy, it's going to be something.

02:10.763 --> 02:12.932
You said it, Cedric.

02:12.932 --> 02:16.436
Huh? Uh oh! I gotta run, Cedric.

02:16.436 --> 02:20.907
Schaeffer wants me to
look after zee Cafe today.

02:20.907 --> 02:25.845
Bert the Raccoon, blue
ribbon chef extraordinaire.

02:27.213 --> 02:28.648
See ya, Cedric!

02:32.152 --> 02:34.787
Cedric,
meet Bonneville Knox.

02:34.787 --> 02:37.690
Oh hi. Pop said
you would be coming.

02:37.690 --> 02:39.192
Make yourself at home.

02:39.192 --> 02:41.261
I'll be finished
in just a minute.

02:41.261 --> 02:43.963
Why thank you, Cedric.

02:48.935 --> 02:50.637
Remember,
what I told you, Cedric.

02:50.637 --> 02:54.374
I don't want anything to
mess up this deal with Knox,

02:54.374 --> 02:57.577
so look after the kid like
he was a blue chip stock.

02:57.577 --> 02:58.711
Capeesh?

02:58.711 --> 02:59.879
Right, Pop.

03:06.352 --> 03:09.622
Don't just
stand there sweating!

03:09.622 --> 03:12.192
Get that stuff up to
Bonneville's room!

03:12.192 --> 03:14.994
Uuuh, aaaah!

03:18.498 --> 03:20.166
This is sissy stuff.

03:20.166 --> 03:22.535
Let's go have some fun.

03:23.736 --> 03:25.905
Hey, what are you doing?

03:25.905 --> 03:27.473
Whatever I like,

03:27.473 --> 03:30.176
because I'm only gonna be
here for the weekend.

03:30.176 --> 03:32.946
You got a problem
with that, four eyes?

03:33.980 --> 03:34.948
What!?

03:38.384 --> 03:41.554
Ah, bon jour, Cedric.

03:41.554 --> 03:43.022
How may I serve you, hah?

03:43.022 --> 03:45.558
A chocolate pudding frappe?

03:45.558 --> 03:47.760
Or perhaps, monsieur
would prefer

03:47.760 --> 03:49.796
a peanut butter soda, huh?

03:49.796 --> 03:53.032
Bert, suppose
there was a bully around,

03:53.032 --> 03:54.867
what would you do?

03:54.867 --> 03:56.736
Well, I'd
stay away from him.

03:56.736 --> 04:00.640
Ya, but what
if that was impossible.

04:00.640 --> 04:03.409
Cedric, is there
something bothering you?

04:05.678 --> 04:07.614
Master Cedric,

04:07.614 --> 04:10.717
the boss wants you back
at the mansion pronto.

04:10.717 --> 04:13.853
Pig 2: Ya, Bonneville
is getting bored.

04:13.853 --> 04:15.488
Bonneville?

04:15.488 --> 04:17.890
Ya, Bonneville.

04:17.890 --> 04:19.726
See ya later, Bert...

04:20.893 --> 04:21.961
I hope.

04:21.961 --> 04:24.297
Hey, Cedric you
forgot your...

04:25.431 --> 04:26.699
Bonneville?!

04:28.201 --> 04:30.203
I don't mean to
cause trouble for Cedric,

04:30.203 --> 04:33.606
Mr. Sneer, but well,
he did leave me here

04:33.606 --> 04:36.909
all alone, by myself.

04:36.909 --> 04:40.146
He did, eh?
Well, we can't have that.

04:44.217 --> 04:46.919
Mission accomplished, Sir.
Amazing!

04:46.919 --> 04:49.489
With you three, it's usually
mission impossible.

04:49.489 --> 04:51.024
Now, wash the limo.

04:51.591 --> 04:54.294
Cedric, I want
to see you inside.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.762
Yes, Pop.

04:55.762 --> 04:57.497
What's the matter
with kids these days?

04:57.497 --> 04:59.999
Can't they get anything?
Don't people understand them?

04:59.999 --> 05:01.801
Hey, four eyes,

05:01.801 --> 05:04.437
don't even think of
running out on me again.

05:04.437 --> 05:08.107
I said, we were gonna be
friends and I meant it.

05:18.985 --> 05:21.487
You.. wanted
to see me, Pop?

05:21.487 --> 05:22.922
What do you
mean by running away

05:22.922 --> 05:24.824
and leaving
Bonneville like that?

05:24.824 --> 05:26.959
We can't afford to upset him.

05:26.959 --> 05:29.028
Who knows what he
would say to Knox?

05:29.028 --> 05:31.431
Well Pop, the fact is...

05:31.431 --> 05:33.333
And you know
what Knox is like.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.336
Any little excuse and
he will cancel the deal.

05:36.336 --> 05:39.472
Now go and be
nice to Bonneville.

05:39.472 --> 05:41.941
Ugh.. all right, Pop.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.847
I said,
give me the car keys!

05:49.515 --> 05:51.217
No way, Jose.

05:51.217 --> 05:53.353
This is the boss' car.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.021
Pig 2: He'd send us
to the smoke house

05:55.021 --> 05:57.123
if we let anyone drive it.

05:57.123 --> 06:03.129
Nah nah nah nah nah!

06:03.129 --> 06:04.330
Hmmmm..?

06:09.902 --> 06:12.271
Pig 3: What do you
want, swamp breath?

06:13.206 --> 06:15.842
Heyyyy! Oooh! Aaah...

06:15.842 --> 06:19.078
Ready to
give me the car keys?

06:19.078 --> 06:22.482
Never!...Oooh! Aaah...

06:22.482 --> 06:24.250
What are you doing?!

06:24.250 --> 06:25.918
Hee-hee!

06:25.918 --> 06:27.787
Stop that right now!

06:30.523 --> 06:32.392
Ugh-oh!

06:33.993 --> 06:35.695
Uaaah!

06:35.695 --> 06:38.931
Uh-aah!

06:38.931 --> 06:40.900
Oooh!

06:40.900 --> 06:43.069
Thank you, master Cedric.

06:45.705 --> 06:49.342
I.. just who do
you think you are?

06:49.342 --> 06:52.111
I'm Mr. Knox's nephew.

06:52.111 --> 06:56.883
You know, the guy your old man
wants to strike a deal with.

06:56.883 --> 07:00.453
One word from me
and it's up in smoke.

07:00.453 --> 07:05.057
Uh.. Pop doesn't
have to know about this.

07:05.057 --> 07:07.260
I knew it, chicken.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.162
You stop that right now!

07:09.162 --> 07:11.464
Gonna have your
little piggy's stop me

07:11.464 --> 07:14.300
four eyes, or are you
gonna do it yourself?

07:14.300 --> 07:16.269
You can't...
The keys.

07:16.269 --> 07:19.472
The keys? No way!

07:20.239 --> 07:22.542
That's
more like it, four eyes.

07:22.542 --> 07:26.312
Now, let's see what this
old rattle trap can do!

07:32.452 --> 07:34.954
We've gotta do something.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.989
Pig 2: And we've
got to do it fast!

07:36.989 --> 07:39.625
Cedric can't take
much more of this!

07:39.625 --> 07:42.829
Eeeh, and neither can we.

07:42.829 --> 07:46.065
Pig 3: Wait! I've got an idea!

07:46.065 --> 07:48.334
And guess what?

07:48.334 --> 07:50.436
Pig 2: It's brilliant!

07:50.436 --> 07:52.371
Pig 3: It always is.

07:52.371 --> 07:56.209
One for all,
and all for Cedric.

07:57.076 --> 07:58.511
Well, how were they?

07:58.511 --> 08:00.112
No, no, don't tell me!

08:00.112 --> 08:02.415
Stupendous, stunning,

08:02.415 --> 08:04.650
incredibly delicious!

08:06.419 --> 08:08.287
That about says it all, Bert.

08:08.287 --> 08:10.289
(giggles) Thank you.

08:12.692 --> 08:14.660
See you later, Bert.
Bye, Bert!

08:19.532 --> 08:22.301
Yup, nothing
like a cold soda pop

08:22.301 --> 08:25.338
after a hard drive,
right Cedric, old buddy?

08:25.838 --> 08:27.540
Buy me a couple.

08:27.540 --> 08:30.209
Um.. two sodas, please.

08:30.209 --> 08:32.478
Ah yes, sodas.

08:32.478 --> 08:35.348
Mh-hmm, I have them
in the back room,

08:35.348 --> 08:37.517
if you will walk this way.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.657
So that's Bonneville, eh?

08:44.657 --> 08:46.526
Is he giving you
a hard time, Cedric?

08:46.526 --> 08:47.660
Well...

08:47.660 --> 08:49.829
Come on, Cedric.
I can see, what's happening.

08:49.829 --> 08:52.131
And you've only got two choices.

08:52.131 --> 08:54.333
I'll take
the orange soda, Bert.

08:54.333 --> 08:59.205
No, I mean two choices in
dealing with Bonneville.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.541
You can face up to him,

09:01.541 --> 09:04.076
or you can tell your Pop.

09:04.076 --> 09:08.347
But Bert, I'd just like
to forget about it for a while

09:08.347 --> 09:11.384
and maybe we should
call off the trip

09:11.384 --> 09:13.753
to the Quartz Tower tonight.

09:13.753 --> 09:16.188
I mean, what if Bonneville...

09:16.188 --> 09:17.323
Forget him!

09:17.323 --> 09:19.525
We can't miss the
event of the decade.

09:19.525 --> 09:22.762
We're going! Bonneville
or no Bonneville.

09:22.762 --> 09:25.765
I'll meet you after
the moon comes up, ok?

09:27.400 --> 09:28.668
We better get out there

09:28.668 --> 09:31.237
before he comes looking for me.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.572
OK, Cedric.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.408
Oh, take your sodas,
I've gotta get some eggs.

09:38.878 --> 09:40.446
Cheer up, Cedric.

09:42.214 --> 09:43.649
Oh-oaaah!

09:43.649 --> 09:45.384
Woaaaah!

09:45.384 --> 09:47.019
Auuu!

09:47.019 --> 09:48.754
Sorry about that,

09:48.754 --> 09:50.890
but you shouldn't leave
a jar of gum balls

09:50.890 --> 09:53.392
sitting where someone
can knock them over.

09:54.093 --> 09:56.729
Come on, Cedric, we're leaving!

09:56.729 --> 09:58.931
Let me at him!
Let me at him!

09:58.931 --> 10:01.601
No Bert,
this is my problem!

10:02.868 --> 10:04.203
That's it!

10:04.203 --> 10:07.707
Cedric is getting my help
whether he wants it or not.

10:07.707 --> 10:09.141
Ah! Ouh!

10:11.210 --> 10:11.744
It was the hardest thing

10:11.744 --> 10:13.779
It was the hardest
thing I ever did.

10:13.779 --> 10:16.749
I had to just stand there
and watch that bully

10:16.749 --> 10:18.551
push Cedric around!

10:18.551 --> 10:20.453
Any more marshmallows?

10:20.453 --> 10:22.154
Try the bottom right.

10:22.154 --> 10:23.322
Oh, thanks!

10:23.322 --> 10:26.025
And Bonneville's got
Cedric so jumpy,

10:26.025 --> 10:29.061
he wanted to pull out of our
trip to the caverns tonight.

10:29.061 --> 10:31.864
I don't know how
anyone could bully Cedric.

10:31.864 --> 10:34.166
He is the sweetest
person I know.

10:34.166 --> 10:36.235
He'd never hurt anybody.

10:36.235 --> 10:39.305
Yeah, and nobody's
gonna hurt him!

10:39.305 --> 10:41.941
Not when Bert Raccoon is around.

10:41.941 --> 10:43.776
Don't
talk nonsense, Bert.

10:43.776 --> 10:45.978
Two wrongs don't make a right.

10:45.978 --> 10:49.048
Yeah, but no
matter how it adds up,

10:49.048 --> 10:51.217
Cedric needs help.

10:51.217 --> 10:53.252
See you, guys, later!

10:54.520 --> 10:55.621
Hmmm...

10:55.621 --> 10:59.125
Tired of bullies kicking
sand in your face?

10:59.125 --> 11:00.126
Yeah!!

11:00.126 --> 11:02.528
Then follow
Joe Weiner's course

11:02.528 --> 11:04.497
to a perfect physique.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.499
Fear no one!

11:06.499 --> 11:08.868
Pig 2: Look out, Bonneville,

11:08.868 --> 11:11.570
we're gonna pump iron!

12:21.207 --> 12:23.209
we wouldn't tell you, Sir.

12:24.944 --> 12:26.579
Tell me what?

12:26.579 --> 12:29.415
Pig 3: It's a long story, boss.

12:29.415 --> 12:33.385
And I've got a short
temper. Tell it quick!

12:33.385 --> 12:37.356
Well, boss, uh,
you see it's like this...

12:39.091 --> 12:41.227
Cedric? Cedric?

12:41.227 --> 12:43.596
Your partner in
adventure awaits.

12:48.300 --> 12:49.301
Quiet, Broo!

12:51.537 --> 12:53.272
Cedric?

12:53.272 --> 12:57.643
No! Don't!
Leave me alone!

12:59.011 --> 13:01.747
Come back here, four eyes!

13:01.747 --> 13:04.650
I'm your best buddy,
four eyes!

13:04.650 --> 13:08.320
No! Leave me alone!

13:08.320 --> 13:12.391
Nobody here
but you and me, four eyes!

13:15.561 --> 13:19.565
Cedric... Cedric...

13:19.565 --> 13:23.803
Cedric, it's me! It's me, Bert!

13:23.803 --> 13:25.304
Auuu!

13:25.304 --> 13:30.442
Oh, Bert,
am I glad to see you!

13:30.442 --> 13:32.678
I thought you were Bonneville!

13:32.678 --> 13:34.647
No, I'm
much better looking.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.849
Well, are you ready to go?

13:36.849 --> 13:38.250
You bet I am!

13:38.250 --> 13:42.087
And I'm not going to worry about
Bonneville any more tonight.

13:42.087 --> 13:43.656
That a boy, Cedric!

13:43.656 --> 13:46.325
And maybe we can
figure out some way,

13:46.325 --> 13:48.761
to get that bully
out of your hair!

13:49.495 --> 13:52.498
It ain't
gonna be that easy, boys.

13:58.137 --> 14:01.974
Next time you paranoid
porkers withhold information,

14:01.974 --> 14:05.344
I'll withhold your
paycheques, for good!

14:05.344 --> 14:07.413
Shall we, um, ehm,

14:07.413 --> 14:10.082
look after Bonneville, Sir?

14:10.082 --> 14:12.618
We've been working out all day.

14:12.618 --> 14:15.020
Pig 2: Ya, we're perfect

14:15.020 --> 14:18.390
physical specimens now, boss.

14:18.390 --> 14:20.359
Uuu-uuuh!

14:20.359 --> 14:22.995
Oh ya?!
And I'm Goldilocks.

14:22.995 --> 14:26.498
Wait here, a problem
like this requires

14:26.498 --> 14:29.535
subtlety and finesse.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.070
Cedric!

14:32.538 --> 14:34.340
Are you awake, son?

14:35.241 --> 14:39.712
Good! Look son, there is
no need to be ashamed.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.848
I didn't realize
Bonneville was a bully.

14:42.848 --> 14:46.252
I guess I was more interested
in the deal with Knox

14:46.252 --> 14:47.653
than listening to you.

14:47.653 --> 14:51.724
But business means nothing next
to your happiness, Cedric.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.158
I hope you know that.

14:55.127 --> 14:58.330
I can tell you a few things
about Bonneville son.

14:58.330 --> 15:02.268
For years he's been shuffled
from one relative to the next.

15:02.268 --> 15:05.404
He's never had the chance
to get to know anyone.

15:05.404 --> 15:08.707
I know it doesn't
excuse his behavior,

15:08.707 --> 15:10.943
but maybe it explains it.

15:11.610 --> 15:15.180
I feel sorry for him,
because son,

15:15.180 --> 15:17.583
he does not know
what he's missing.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.185
He could have had
you for a friend.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.288
Good night, Cedric.

15:22.288 --> 15:25.224
I'll see to it Bonneville's
gone in the morning.

15:29.628 --> 15:32.865
Sure, Bonneville's
always gone in the morning.

15:32.865 --> 15:35.534
He never leaves anything behind.

15:35.534 --> 15:38.070
Not even friends.

15:46.145 --> 15:48.047
Oh, boy, the
blue moon will be in the

15:48.047 --> 15:50.215
perfect position pretty soon!

15:50.215 --> 15:52.451
Well, what
are we waiting for?

15:52.451 --> 15:55.321
Let's get down
to the Quartz Tower.

15:55.321 --> 15:57.823
I love this part!

15:58.557 --> 16:02.094
Bert Raccoon...

16:02.094 --> 16:05.931
Raccoon, Raccoon.

16:05.931 --> 16:08.400
Cedric/Bert:

16:10.135 --> 16:13.305
Bonneville is a stinker!

16:13.305 --> 16:16.575
Stinker,
stinker, stinker.

16:16.575 --> 16:20.779
Bonneville eats old socks!

16:20.779 --> 16:24.650
Socks, socks, socks.

16:24.650 --> 16:27.619
Bert/Cedric: Bonneville
is a beetle brain!

16:27.619 --> 16:29.655
Beetle brain,
beetle brain.

16:29.655 --> 16:32.925
Cedric/Bert:

16:36.328 --> 16:40.799
This is great, peanut
butter and moon light.

16:40.799 --> 16:43.869
And when the blue
moon shines on the tower,

16:43.869 --> 16:48.774
we'll see something hardly
anybody else has ever seen!

16:49.975 --> 16:52.945
(calls) Cedric!
Cedric, Cedric...

16:52.945 --> 16:54.813
Where are you?

16:55.981 --> 16:58.617
Yikes! It's Bonneville!

16:58.617 --> 16:59.985
He's after me!

16:59.985 --> 17:02.287
D-don't worry, Cedric.

17:03.055 --> 17:05.991
(calls) Cedric!
Cedric, Cedric...

17:05.991 --> 17:08.727
Cedric, I've been
looking all over for you.

17:08.727 --> 17:09.995
And now you've found us,

17:09.995 --> 17:12.464
so, w-what are you going
to do about it?

17:12.464 --> 17:14.700
I just
want to talk to Cedric.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.735
Look Cedric, I've been...

17:16.735 --> 17:19.138
Well, he doesn't
want to talk to you!

17:19.138 --> 17:20.706
There's the way out!

17:20.706 --> 17:22.374
Hey! Oh-au!

17:22.374 --> 17:25.210
I'm not leaving 'til
I finish what I came to say.

17:25.811 --> 17:30.182
That's it!
Nobody pushes my friend around.

17:30.716 --> 17:33.052
Here, Bert, hold these.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.553
Bu-but...

17:34.553 --> 17:37.122
But I just.. I-I wanted...

17:37.122 --> 17:40.592
Yaaaaaaah!
Woaaah!

17:43.062 --> 17:45.731
Cedric! Bonneville!
Can you hear me?

17:45.731 --> 17:47.900
It's full of water!

17:47.900 --> 17:50.903
I can't touch bottom!

17:50.903 --> 17:53.372
It's all
your fault, four eyes.

17:53.372 --> 17:54.873
I'm going for help.

17:54.873 --> 17:57.109
Hurry, Bert!

17:57.109 --> 17:59.912
I can tread water for a while,

17:59.912 --> 18:02.581
but I don't know about Bonneville.

18:02.581 --> 18:04.550
Don't
worry about Bonneville.

18:04.550 --> 18:08.287
Here Bonneville,
I've got a hand hold.

18:08.287 --> 18:11.623
Save your strength
and hang on to me.

18:11.623 --> 18:13.358
I don't... need help.

18:13.358 --> 18:15.627
Fine, neither do I!

18:15.627 --> 18:16.728
Fine.

18:24.236 --> 18:25.771
Cyril! Cyril!

18:25.771 --> 18:28.540
Open up! Let me in!

18:28.540 --> 18:32.311
What?! I'll let you in
for a lifetime of trouble,

18:32.311 --> 18:34.480
if you don't get
out of here pronto!

18:34.480 --> 18:35.914
It's the middle of the night!

18:35.914 --> 18:38.650
Cedric and
Bonneville are in trouble!

18:39.885 --> 18:41.053
Don't go away!

18:42.654 --> 18:45.257
Bonneville/Cedric:

18:45.257 --> 18:48.160
Anytime you want to
quit, be my guest, four eyes.

18:48.894 --> 18:51.497
All you have to do is
grab onto that ledge.

18:51.497 --> 18:54.733
I can do this for days!

18:57.269 --> 19:00.806
Pigs, anything
happens to my son,

19:00.806 --> 19:02.808
I'll hold you responsible.

19:02.808 --> 19:05.944
Us?! We were
sleeping, boss.

19:05.944 --> 19:07.813
See? They admit it!

19:10.015 --> 19:12.351
You know, I didn't
come here to fight you,

19:12.351 --> 19:16.088
four eyes.
Don't call me four eyes.

19:16.088 --> 19:18.357
Then, then
don't call me a stinker!

19:18.357 --> 19:21.426
Why not?
That's what you are.

19:21.426 --> 19:24.830
So what? I can still
tread water longer than you.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.064
Cedric!

19:27.466 --> 19:29.535
Cedric my boy!

19:29.535 --> 19:32.304
Bonneville! Are you alright?

19:32.304 --> 19:33.972
Grab the ropes.

19:33.972 --> 19:35.374
Wait!

19:35.374 --> 19:37.543
We are fine, Pop,

19:37.543 --> 19:40.145
but we are not ready
to come up yet.

19:40.812 --> 19:44.016
They are not
ready to come up yet?!

19:44.016 --> 19:47.152
I thought you said
they were in deadly danger?

19:47.853 --> 19:51.456
Um.. will
you be ready soon?

19:51.456 --> 19:52.991
Look Cedric,

19:52.991 --> 19:55.294
maybe I am a stinker.

19:55.294 --> 19:56.495
Maybe...

19:57.196 --> 19:59.131
Maybe, I'm sorry.

19:59.131 --> 20:00.666
Why all of a sudden?

20:00.666 --> 20:02.734
Because
I've got no more time.

20:02.734 --> 20:07.706
Because I'll be.. gone in
the morning, like always.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.842
Can we be.. I mean...

20:10.842 --> 20:13.378
Can we be friends?

20:13.378 --> 20:16.682
Maybe.. we can try.

20:16.682 --> 20:18.517
On three.

20:18.517 --> 20:19.885
One...

20:19.885 --> 20:21.053
Two...

20:21.053 --> 20:22.221
Bonneville/Cedric: Three.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.222
Beat you.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.723
Did not.

20:24.723 --> 20:28.860
Okay, we're ready.
They're ready.

20:29.861 --> 20:31.730
Cyril/Pigs:

20:31.730 --> 20:34.066
I think we've got...

20:34.066 --> 20:37.236
Bonneville, Sir.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.870
I thought you
pudgy porkers,

20:38.870 --> 20:41.039
were perfect physical specimens.

20:48.213 --> 20:50.882
What do you two mean by
scaring me half to death?

20:50.882 --> 20:53.719
Why I.. what?

20:53.719 --> 20:55.754
Wow!

20:55.754 --> 20:57.556
Cedric,
what's happening here?

20:58.390 --> 21:02.794
Something that happens
once in a blue moon, Pop.

21:02.794 --> 21:05.364
Uuuh! Oooh!

21:05.364 --> 21:07.733
Oooooh!

21:11.937 --> 21:15.040
You won't regret
signing this deal, Knox.

21:15.040 --> 21:16.308
I promise you.

21:16.308 --> 21:19.444
Mr. Knox: Mhm! I hope not, Sir.

21:19.444 --> 21:22.147
Cedric, maybe...

21:22.147 --> 21:24.950
Maybe I can come back
and visit sometime?

21:24.950 --> 21:28.253
Sure. Maybe
we can go swimming.

21:28.253 --> 21:30.322
Right.

21:32.791 --> 21:35.894
I'm proud of the way you
handled Bonneville son.

21:35.894 --> 21:37.029
Thanks, Pop.

21:37.029 --> 21:41.166
Maybe we will be real good
friends... someday.

21:41.166 --> 21:44.403
I hope so, son.
I hope so.
