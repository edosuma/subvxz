00:06.740 --> 00:09.377
- So remember, if your attacker
comes at you, you gonna panic?

00:09.477 --> 00:11.112
- No.
- Yes.

00:11.212 --> 00:12.513
- No, 'cause you've got
your eyeball scoops,

00:12.613 --> 00:15.116
you got your kitten scratches--

00:15.216 --> 00:17.518
And then you're gonna be clear
to pummel the groin.

00:17.618 --> 00:20.588
And...you're dead.

00:22.656 --> 00:23.791
- Wow.

00:25.426 --> 00:26.627
- I'll tell you
what I'm inspired by--

00:26.727 --> 00:29.197
those tris and those bis.
- Mm-hmm.

00:29.297 --> 00:31.299
- And that's why I call it
self-defense...

00:31.399 --> 00:33.067
all: For moms!

00:33.167 --> 00:34.535
- 'Cause, as moms, we have
a natural instinct

00:34.635 --> 00:36.304
to want to protect our young.
- That's right.

00:36.404 --> 00:37.605
- Maggie, you've got
a young daughter at home.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.407
I do, Cookie--She's one.

00:39.507 --> 00:41.342
Her name is Charlotte,
and she's a fierce warrior.

00:41.442 --> 00:42.343
- What's up with
that voice you're using?

00:44.278 --> 00:45.446
Nope, I'm
Emma, I'm the best friend.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.148
I moved home to help
her raise the baby--

00:47.248 --> 00:48.549
- When I kicked my cheating
husband to the curb.

00:48.649 --> 00:50.551
- That's right.
We're sisters for life, Cookie.

00:52.586 --> 00:55.356
- I need a moment.
I'm sorry.

00:57.525 --> 00:59.560
- This right here is
the definition of friendship.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.562
- That's right.
- Two women, side by side--

01:01.662 --> 01:04.398
that is the most powerful thing
that there is.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.134
Now get on up here
and attack each other.

01:06.234 --> 01:07.601
- All right.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.170
What--Oh, God.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.671
Well, Cookie,
hold on one second.

01:10.771 --> 01:12.540
This is my first class,
so I don't think--

01:12.640 --> 01:14.375
- Don't worry about it.
You're gonna be the attacker.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.076
- Okay.
- And Maggie, you just do

01:16.177 --> 01:17.611
all the moves that we've
been working on, okay?

01:17.711 --> 01:19.447
- Yes, Cookie.

01:19.547 --> 01:21.449
- All right, you're at the ATM.
It's late at night.

01:21.549 --> 01:23.184
Emma, attack.

01:23.284 --> 01:24.552
- Beep, boop, beep, boop.

01:24.652 --> 01:28.656
- Ooga-booga, give me your money
and also your body!

01:30.358 --> 01:31.659
- You're dead.
- Ow.

01:31.759 --> 01:34.262
- Nice, Maggie.
- That actually really hurt.

01:34.362 --> 01:36.597
- Remember too, your forearm
is a five

01:36.697 --> 01:38.199
- So you've got one,

01:38.299 --> 01:42.270
two, three, four, and five.
- Ah, ah!

01:42.370 --> 01:44.138
That hurts.
- You're okay.

01:44.238 --> 01:46.240
- So let's sit down, and we'll--
- Nope, stay on up here.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.209
- Do one more scenario.

01:48.309 --> 01:50.711
Maggie, you're at your car.
You're fumbling for your keys.

01:50.811 --> 01:52.580
- Okay.
- Emma, attack.

01:52.680 --> 01:56.184
- Uh, okay, um, Mags,
let's just take it easy--

01:56.284 --> 01:57.385
- Ah!

01:57.485 --> 02:00.221
You're dead!

02:00.321 --> 02:02.256
- She's still alive!
Keep it moving, keep it moving.

02:02.356 --> 02:05.493
- No, no!
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead!

02:07.228 --> 02:08.662
- Yeah, that's right.
Dead men tell no tales.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.464
- Oh, God!

02:10.564 --> 02:13.434
- You're dead.
- And that's self defense...

02:13.534 --> 02:15.636
For moms.

02:15.736 --> 02:16.704
[Say Hi's "Back before
We Were Brittle" playing]

02:16.804 --> 02:20.741
- * Hey, remember when

02:20.841 --> 02:23.511
* All of time stood still

02:23.611 --> 02:27.748
* Ooh, do do do do

02:27.848 --> 02:31.619
* Back before we were brittle

02:31.719 --> 02:34.555
* Back before
we were brittle *

02:36.624 --> 02:38.459
- I think you snapped
my solar plexus.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.160
Well, what was I supposed to do?

02:40.261 --> 02:41.629
You were attacking me at an ATM.

02:41.729 --> 02:44.198
- I just think you could've been
a little nicer about it.

02:44.298 --> 02:46.534
- And, oh, you're dead!
- Oh, oh!

02:46.634 --> 02:48.168
- Sorry, I can't resist.

02:48.269 --> 02:50.504
Maggie, you were incredible
in class today.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.206
You're like a human
machete out there.

02:52.306 --> 02:53.607
- Well, you sharpened
the blade, Cookie.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.543
- Look, Thursdays
around 10:30 p.m.

02:55.643 --> 02:57.611
I hold a special class
that's called "The Cookie Jar."

02:57.711 --> 02:59.413
- Mm-hmm.
- It's for my elite students.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.215
I'd like to invite you to join.

03:01.315 --> 03:02.416
- Oh, my God,
can we make that work?

03:02.516 --> 03:03.584
- Yes, of course
we can make that work.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.386
- Okay, good.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.388
- I give every member
of The Cookie Jar a nickname.

03:07.488 --> 03:08.756
- Okay.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.359
- And there's Nutter Butter,
Double Stuf, Shortbread,

03:11.459 --> 03:13.294
and now Gingersnap.

03:13.394 --> 03:14.962
- Oh, I love it.
- Oh, is that 'cause

03:15.062 --> 03:16.564
she's a red head?
- It's because she's sweet

03:16.664 --> 03:18.499
until she snaps!
- Pow!

03:20.301 --> 03:23.637
- This is for you.
- The golden whistle.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.339
Is this for being most improved?

03:25.439 --> 03:27.708
- I've been teaching this class
for 17 years.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.810
I have never had a student
with less

03:29.910 --> 03:31.779
natural ability than yourself.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.981
- You are a danger to yourself,
so I need you to forget

03:34.081 --> 03:36.216
everything that you learned
here today, okay?

03:36.317 --> 03:38.452
- That won't be a problem.
- It's already forgotten, Cooks.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.288
- Perfect.

03:40.388 --> 03:42.456
- Do you really think
I have no physical strength?

03:42.556 --> 03:44.792
- Hey, she didn't say strength,
she said skills.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.527
And yes.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.796
Wait, is that Mark?

03:48.896 --> 03:51.332
That's our car.
- I'm just doing my job, Miss.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.467
- Oh, my God,
this is ridiculous.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.403
What's this a ticket for?

03:55.503 --> 03:58.472
"Being too sexy"?
- Boom.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.308
- Oh, God, is this
what it's gonna be like

04:00.408 --> 04:01.409
with you guys together?

04:01.509 --> 04:03.544
'Cause I'm not interested.

04:03.644 --> 04:04.745
What is this a ticket for?

04:04.845 --> 04:06.780
Being the best friend?

04:06.880 --> 04:10.418
"Tags are expired"?
- You got 30 days.

04:10.518 --> 04:12.686
I'll see you tonight.
- I'll see you tonight, babe.

04:12.786 --> 04:15.356
- I'm not paying this.
- Yeah, you are.

04:15.456 --> 04:16.624
- You have a woman's
handwriting.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.392
*

04:18.492 --> 04:20.027
- Can I ask you
a quick nursing question?

04:20.127 --> 04:22.496
- Yeah, shoot.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.365
- Ugh, if I had a nickel.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.634
The short answer is yes.
The long answer,

04:26.734 --> 04:29.470
much more complicated,
you know, based on penis size

04:29.570 --> 04:31.605
or shape or whether there's been
a traumatic event

04:31.705 --> 04:34.375
or even just natural slope.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.644
- Yeah, sometimes a penis
can take a slope to the right

04:36.744 --> 04:39.447
or to the left.
If you're lucky, it goes up.

04:39.547 --> 04:41.649
- Oh, okay.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.551
- I think tonight
Mark and I

04:43.651 --> 04:45.285
are gonna do it
for the first time.

04:45.386 --> 04:46.286
- Yes, I mean,

04:46.387 --> 04:47.788
since we got back together.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.823
- What about all that hot and
heavy stuff on the porch?

04:49.923 --> 04:51.725
I thought you guys would've been
all over each other.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.561
It's been a couple weeks.
- No, no, no, no.

04:53.661 --> 04:56.364
He said, and I quote,
"I wanna do this,

04:56.464 --> 04:57.831
but I wanna take it slow."

04:57.931 --> 04:59.533
So, since then, there's just...
- Right.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.435
- Been a lot of dry humping
and starting meaningfully

05:01.535 --> 05:02.670
into each other's eyes.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.438
- Sign me up for
a good dry hump, right?

05:04.538 --> 05:06.073
Although there is
a lot of chafing involved.

05:06.173 --> 05:08.676
- But it's been 15 years since
I've seen, you know, it,

05:08.776 --> 05:10.511
and I just don't know
if it's gonna be, like,

05:10.611 --> 05:13.080
"Oh, hello, old friend," or
"Oh, God, what happened to you?"

05:13.180 --> 05:15.816
- Well, I would be more worried
about him seeing my body,

05:15.916 --> 05:18.886
you know, 15 years later.
'Cause this is 40, right?

05:18.986 --> 05:20.554
Things are very different.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.423
- God, I hadn't even
thought about that.

05:22.523 --> 05:24.358
- Oh.
- Okay, if you saw--if you saw

05:24.458 --> 05:26.594
this coming towards you,
what would you think about that?

05:26.694 --> 05:28.862
Would you be disturbed,
or would you welcome it?

05:28.962 --> 05:30.764
- Is that a special move
I'm not aware of?

05:30.864 --> 05:33.401
- Tell me, does it feel--does it
feel tight, is there reverb?

05:33.501 --> 05:35.102
- Whoa, wow, we, uh,
we can come back.

05:35.202 --> 05:36.770
- Oh, no, no, no, I was just
trying to see if my butt

05:36.870 --> 05:37.905
had changed since college.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.873
- Well, this is 40.
- Oh, God.

05:39.973 --> 05:42.710
- Yeah.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.912
- All right.
- Okay.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.481
- Dive in.
- Ahh-ooh.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.450
- We got some carrots.

05:49.550 --> 05:52.586
- Uh, hey, Mags,
might I have a word?

05:52.686 --> 05:54.888
- Uh, yes, you might.

05:54.988 --> 05:58.859
- Well, it's been approximately
six weeks since we

05:58.959 --> 06:01.695
took Joanie and Cha-Chi
to the carwash.

06:01.795 --> 06:04.898
- Geez, Maggie, the baby...

06:04.998 --> 06:06.800
That's how she got here, right?

06:06.900 --> 06:10.604
- Anyway, since that wonderful
night, I've been feeling--

06:10.704 --> 06:13.974
- Oh, no, no, hey, Bruce,
we talked about this, right?

06:14.074 --> 06:16.777
It was just the one night.
- Oh, no, no, it's not that.

06:16.877 --> 06:20.748
It's, uh, I met somebody.
- Oh, okay, good.

06:20.848 --> 06:23.651
I mean, that's great, yes.
- Her name is Nancy,

06:23.751 --> 06:25.853
and it's been fast and furious,
like the first movie,

06:25.953 --> 06:27.755
not the other seven,
which I feel don't hold up.

06:27.855 --> 06:30.424
- Okay, Bruce, focus.
- Anyhow, um, I really

06:30.524 --> 06:32.392
want Charlotte to meet her,
but I was that maybe

06:32.493 --> 06:34.828
before she meets her
that you might meet her.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.564
- I'd love to meet her.

06:36.664 --> 06:38.932
- Yeah, of course.
We'll have you guys over.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.768
Maybe I'll make
some of my famous apps

06:40.868 --> 06:42.636
and we can throw
some games in there.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.505
That'll be fun, right?
- Hey, can you make those

06:44.605 --> 06:46.807
baby hot dogs that look like
they're taking a nap in pastry?

06:46.907 --> 06:48.776
- Oh, pigs in a blanket.
- Yeah, I guess you

06:48.876 --> 06:50.811
could make those, too,
if you want, pfft.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.646
All right.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.782
*

06:54.882 --> 06:56.784
- You did not have to
make me dinner.

06:56.884 --> 07:00.521
- I haven't ever made anything
other than a DiGiorno's pizza.

07:00.621 --> 07:01.822
- Well, I'm sure it's delicious.

07:05.292 --> 07:07.027
- All right.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.662
- Bon appétit.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.999
- All right.

07:17.905 --> 07:20.508
Now, is this a chicken
or a fish?

07:20.608 --> 07:21.509
- It is a chicken.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.210
- Mm, can't wait.

07:23.310 --> 07:26.580
Okay.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.782
Ooh, there's a crackle.
- Mm-hmm.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.050
There are

07:30.150 --> 07:31.585
- Rice Krispies.

07:31.685 --> 07:32.886
It's a Rice Krispie
crusted chicken.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.688
- Mm, did you come up
with that yourself?

07:34.788 --> 07:37.825
- I did.
I didn't have any hazelnuts.

07:37.925 --> 07:41.962
- And is this a dessert
or a side?

07:42.062 --> 07:46.466
- It's a warm banana.
- Oh, okay.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.035
- Halved...

07:48.135 --> 07:49.970
microwaved for two minutes.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.039
- Hmm.
- Give that a shot.

07:52.139 --> 07:55.042
- Oh, 'cause it's--
Oh, God, the middle is hot!

07:55.142 --> 07:56.977
- Take some water!

07:57.077 --> 07:58.812
Mm.
- This is not a good meal.

07:58.912 --> 08:01.481
- No, no, no, no, I'll just
munch on this dry pasta.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.884
- No, no, it's okay.
- Babe--

08:03.984 --> 08:05.252
I have a better idea.

08:05.352 --> 08:06.587
- I'm gonna go over there

08:06.687 --> 08:08.956
and cue up some music.
- Okay.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.695
["Between the Sheets"
by The Isley Brothers plays]

08:16.964 --> 08:20.768
Okay.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.870
Taking you back to the day?

08:22.970 --> 08:24.905
Oh, you slid into it.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.676
- Oh, yes.
- Come here, girl.

08:28.776 --> 08:30.611
Come on, yeah.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.913
Yeah, that's my lady.

08:35.683 --> 08:38.819
- I haven't heard this song
since the first time we--

08:38.919 --> 08:40.821
- That's right.
That's right.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.723
*

08:42.823 --> 08:44.758
Oh, man,
we did some bad things.

08:48.796 --> 08:51.899
- Every detail.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.834
- Every detail.

08:53.934 --> 08:59.006
*

08:59.106 --> 09:02.643
Mm, no, no, no, I gotta keep you
working for that, mister.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.812
- Pay toll, find the troll.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.313
- You know, gotta

09:06.413 --> 09:09.316
find that troll.

09:09.416 --> 09:12.853
- No, I'm sorry, I think I just
need it to be more spontaneous.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.554
That's all.
- Okay, babe. Sure, sure.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.023
You know what?
Let's get a little dessert.

09:16.123 --> 09:18.125
- Oh, I thought the microwaved
banana was the dessert.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.728
- Settle down,
'cause I got these.

09:20.828 --> 09:23.664
Red Vines!

09:23.764 --> 09:25.666
I thought you said
Red Vines be nasty.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.801
- Well, some things you come
around on, you know?

09:27.901 --> 09:29.603
*

09:29.703 --> 09:32.740
- Hey, Mark. "Happy Feet"!

09:32.840 --> 09:34.107
- That's--That's just Dave.

09:34.207 --> 09:35.609
He's--He's getting divorced.

09:35.709 --> 09:36.977
- Hey, Dave.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.079
I'm in the middle
of something, buddy.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.915
*

09:42.015 --> 09:43.817
- "Happy Feet"!

09:43.917 --> 09:46.119
- No, we just ended up watching

09:46.219 --> 09:48.689
the DVD extras
of "Happy Feet 2"

09:48.789 --> 09:50.157
with a divorcee named Dave.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.792
- Oh, that's tough stuff.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.961
Hey, no, ma'am.

09:54.061 --> 09:55.996
- I only have three
backup trays of those

09:56.096 --> 09:57.898
pigs in a blanket, okay?

09:57.998 --> 10:00.968
- Okay, you need to relax 'cause
this is way too many apps.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.770
- Mm-mm.
- All we're doing is meeting

10:02.870 --> 10:04.004
Bruce's girlfriend.
What's her name again?

10:04.104 --> 10:05.706
- Nancy.
- Yeah, she's probably, like,

10:05.806 --> 10:08.141
a out of work temp
with a terrible bob and rosacea.

10:08.241 --> 10:10.811
- I'm sure
she's very sweet, okay?

10:10.911 --> 10:12.846
And I would just like her
to feel welcome in my home.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.882
- A lesser woman might
be freaked out about meeting

10:14.982 --> 10:16.116
their ex-husband's
new girlfriend.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.785
- Not this old gal.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.086
- I'm very happy for them,

10:19.186 --> 10:20.788
and I think it's gonna
be good for all of us.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.122
- Well, I feel good about
having some of this

10:22.222 --> 10:23.857
seven-layer dip now.
- Hey, no, you don't.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.059
- Oh, ah!
- And you're dead.

10:26.159 --> 10:28.729
- God, I'm not gonna
get physically attacked

10:28.829 --> 10:30.097
at my own apps table,
you psycho.

10:30.197 --> 10:31.665
- Well, you just did.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.869
You gotta be ready, okay?

10:35.969 --> 10:39.773
'Cause 94% of attacks
happen in your own home.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.942
*

10:42.042 --> 10:43.844
Cookie?
- Gingersnap!

10:43.944 --> 10:46.847
- Bruce!

10:46.947 --> 10:49.917
*

10:51.719 --> 10:53.954
- This is just blowing my mind.

10:54.054 --> 10:57.024
I mean, Cookie is Nancy,
Nancy is Cookie?

10:57.124 --> 10:59.326
- Yeah, what are
the chances, right?

10:59.426 --> 11:01.929
I mean, there aren't any,
but here we are.

11:02.029 --> 11:02.930
- I didn't even know
you guys knew each other.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.331
both: Yeah.

11:04.431 --> 11:05.933
- Maggie's in the Cookie Jar.
- That's right.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.200
- A little different
than the Cookie Jar

11:07.300 --> 11:08.335
you've been digging in
every night.

11:08.435 --> 11:11.204
- Okay.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.440
How did you guys possibly meet?

11:13.540 --> 11:16.076
- I was in a Party City on
a Friday night,

11:16.176 --> 11:17.410
as one does...
- Mm-hmm.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.748
- Buying myself a piñata.

11:20.848 --> 11:23.450
- End of a hard week,
you just string up a piñata,

11:23.550 --> 11:26.053
whack the crap out of it,
and it rains candy on you.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.221
It's the best.
- But I don't understand.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.690
Cookie, you were also
buying a piñata?

11:30.791 --> 11:32.459
- Yeah, I mean,
what are the odds, right?

11:32.559 --> 11:35.228
When two people who both
love piñatas find each other?

11:35.328 --> 11:37.097
- Very unexpected.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.431
- 'Cause, you know, normally
I date, you know,

11:38.531 --> 11:40.233
really tough guys, right?

11:40.333 --> 11:42.235
- It's what I would assume
- Yeah, bounty hunters,

11:42.335 --> 11:45.472
MMA fighters,
and large animal vets,

11:45.572 --> 11:48.108
but, man, none of those guys
made me laugh like this man.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.978
You're a party in a bottle.
- There's no denying that.

11:51.078 --> 11:54.481
- And the physical part is
just...it's, um...

11:54.581 --> 11:56.316
seamless.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.718
- When you say "seamless,"
what do you mean by--

11:58.819 --> 12:01.421
- Well, we need more apps.
- You don't know where his body

12:01.521 --> 12:03.356
ends and yours begins?

12:03.456 --> 12:05.125
- I do, yeah.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.994
- I'm good, thanks.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.328
- I'll get you some then.

12:10.130 --> 12:12.199
- Oh, my God,
can you believe it?

12:12.299 --> 12:14.267
We thought Nancy was gonna be
some terrible woman

12:14.367 --> 12:17.237
who was like, "my Crock-Pot,"
and instead, it's Cookie!

12:17.337 --> 12:19.106
- You must be so psyched.

12:19.206 --> 12:22.075
- I am so psyched, really.
- Oh, God, imagine what

12:22.175 --> 12:24.144
Charlotte's fifth birthday
would be like, right?

12:24.244 --> 12:25.512
- When Cookie rolls up,

12:25.612 --> 12:27.380
like, piñatas aplenty,
everyone will be like,

12:27.480 --> 12:29.282
"Hey, Cookie's here!"

12:29.382 --> 12:31.751
'Cause that's not gonna happen.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.153
They're not gonna last.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.055
She's like the perfect
physical specimen,

12:35.155 --> 12:36.523
and he's just, you know, Bruce.

12:36.623 --> 12:39.059
- It makes now sense at all,
and, at the same time,

12:39.159 --> 12:41.094
it kind of makes all
the sense in the world.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.462
I mean, look at them.

12:42.562 --> 12:45.365
Like two hippos
wrestling in the wild.

12:45.465 --> 12:48.301
- Oh, that's a classic viper
hold into a Chinese handcuff.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.304
Man.

12:51.404 --> 12:53.506
We learned that
two weeks ago.

12:53.606 --> 12:56.043
God, she's good.

12:56.143 --> 12:57.777
Oh, we didn't learn that one.

12:57.878 --> 13:00.180
We should not be watching this.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.483
And I am all alone.

13:03.583 --> 13:06.353
- Officer Rodriguez,
at your service.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.521
- Mark,
what are you doing here?

13:08.621 --> 13:10.357
- I'm being spontaneous.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.359
I slipped in through the
window, "Dawson's Creek" style.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.427
- No, you didn't.
- Oh, yes, I did.

13:14.527 --> 13:17.297
You better come over here, girl,
'cause I don't wanna wait.

13:17.397 --> 13:20.267
- There is a former MMA fighter
named Cookie downstairs.

13:20.367 --> 13:23.503
- Well, then we're gonna
have to be quiet, huh?

13:27.908 --> 13:31.211
You know what?

13:31.311 --> 13:34.547
What if we were to do it
in the dark, dark recesses

13:34.647 --> 13:37.284
of the closet over there?
- Oh, yeah, that sounds great.

13:37.384 --> 13:39.419
- Okay.
- All right.

13:41.221 --> 13:42.489
- Oh, God, there's some stuff
in there, sorry.

13:42.589 --> 13:43.924
- Oh, wow, there's a lot of
stuff in here.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.358
That's gonna make for
a tight fit.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.826
- Yeah, you know,
that'll only be sexier.

13:46.927 --> 13:49.129
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
- Ouch, ouch.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.131
- I can't--ow.
- Ow.

13:51.231 --> 13:52.365
- Oh, God.

13:53.466 --> 13:56.169
- It's Maggie, shh, shh.

13:57.604 --> 13:59.272
- Hey!

13:59.372 --> 14:00.874
- I'm dying down there.

14:00.974 --> 14:03.510
- I thought Cookie would
wanna see my old hockey stick,

14:03.610 --> 14:04.844
you know?

14:04.945 --> 14:06.379
Remember how good
I was at that?

14:06.479 --> 14:08.448
- Stop it, stop it, shut up.

14:08.548 --> 14:09.917
Shut up, there's someone
in here. We're not alone.

14:10.017 --> 14:11.451
- I don't hear anybody.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.386
- You shut your mouth
for once in your damn life

14:13.486 --> 14:17.257
if you wanna survive this night.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.960
- I think we're okay, I mean.
- Okay--

14:20.060 --> 14:21.394
- Maggie, you're
being ridiculous.

14:21.494 --> 14:23.496
- Okay, there is
a man's footprint,

14:23.596 --> 14:25.198
a formal wear shoe,
look at that.

14:25.298 --> 14:26.633
- All right, Mags, it's just--

14:26.733 --> 14:28.501
You're dead.
- Oh!

14:28.601 --> 14:30.870
- Oh, my God, Mark!

14:30.971 --> 14:33.573
Oh, oh, my larynx.

14:33.673 --> 14:36.543
*

14:36.643 --> 14:38.445
My larynx.
- Okay.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.247
- My larynx.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

14:40.347 --> 14:41.982
I thought you were an intruder.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.417
- Gingersnap, don't you ever
apologize for your strength.

14:44.517 --> 14:45.919
- Got it.

14:46.019 --> 14:48.155
- Why were you in Emma's room
wearing a tuxedo?

14:48.255 --> 14:50.958
- Hey, man, I was just trying to
sneak in and surprise my lady.

14:51.058 --> 14:52.425
- That's very romantic.

14:52.525 --> 14:57.397
Excuse me,
I have to take a moment...

14:57.497 --> 14:58.932
What's happening?

15:00.033 --> 15:01.468
- 'Cause that was beautiful.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.271
- Hey, I have an idea.
Wanna play some games?

15:04.371 --> 15:06.339
- One moment, Gingersnap.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.675
I have to say something.

15:08.775 --> 15:15.015
Oh, Bruce, I have spent most of
my life closed off to intimacy,

15:15.115 --> 15:17.684
protecting myself, but,
since we've met, I've learned

15:17.784 --> 15:23.290
to open up and lay down
my emotional weapons.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.525
I love you, babe.

15:25.625 --> 15:26.693
- I love you too.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.661
Games.

15:28.761 --> 15:29.662
both: What?

15:29.762 --> 15:31.231
- Oh, yeah.

15:31.331 --> 15:32.699
Games!

15:32.799 --> 15:35.935
- * Open yourself up
and love some games *

15:37.604 --> 15:39.339
- * Some games

15:39.439 --> 15:41.441
We could play Skalagoes, huh?

15:41.541 --> 15:43.210
- Honey, I don't know
what you're saying.

15:43.310 --> 15:44.644
- Hey, scribble Scrabble,
where's the piece at?

15:44.744 --> 15:47.514
- Something is not right there.
- Let's play some games!

15:49.016 --> 15:51.618
- Okay, so, "I'm just a girl,
standing here--"

15:51.718 --> 15:52.619
- "Notting Hill."
"Notting Hill"!

15:52.719 --> 15:54.321
- That's it, yes!

15:54.421 --> 15:55.588
- You should've just
said Julia Roberts.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.224
- Emma, don't tell me
how to play the game.

15:57.324 --> 15:58.591
- Okay, fine, fine, fine,
go, go, go, go.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.460
- Turn it up, turn it up.
- What is--Oh, okay.

16:00.560 --> 16:01.594
- This is a place where they're
growing dinosaurs, and children

16:01.694 --> 16:03.263
and their families
come and visit.

16:03.363 --> 16:04.731
- Why would you bring
a dinosaur back to life?

16:04.831 --> 16:06.533
- You know what's gonna happen.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.335
Electricity's gonna go out,
and then all hell's

16:08.435 --> 16:10.003
gonna break loose.
- Yeah, that's exactly what

16:10.103 --> 16:11.471
happens, but say the movie.
- Some of those dinosaurs

16:11.571 --> 16:12.972
are really smart, like,
I believe a raptor could

16:13.073 --> 16:14.474
use its claws to open a door.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.043
- And then you'd be like, "Ah!"

16:16.143 --> 16:20.513
Oh, what was it, babe?
- It's "Jurassic Park"!

16:20.613 --> 16:22.515
- Nuts, I didn't see that one.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.217
- We should put that one
on our cue though, right?

16:24.317 --> 16:26.019
Sounds scary.
- Bruce, Cookie, you're up.

16:26.119 --> 16:27.487
- Yes.

16:27.587 --> 16:30.357
Here you guys go.
Here you go, here you go.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.659
- You know I am.

16:36.296 --> 16:38.331
- Duck.
- "Nine and a Half Weeks."

16:38.431 --> 16:41.368
- Yes.
Fire truck.

16:41.468 --> 16:42.535
- "A Golden Pond."
- Yes.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.405
- Icicle.
- "Indiana Jones:

16:45.505 --> 16:48.007
Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."

16:48.108 --> 16:51.078
- Chicken.
Chicken.

16:51.178 --> 16:52.379
Chicken.
- "Turner and Hooch."

16:53.813 --> 16:55.282
- That was amazing.
- I've seen better.

16:55.382 --> 16:56.649
- All right, you guys
get up there.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.651
- No, I'm good--

16:58.751 --> 17:00.653
I don't have a partner, so.
- We'll all be your partner.

17:00.753 --> 17:02.655
- Come on, we're all doing it.
- I'm keeping score in my head.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.524
- You said you were open to
loving some games, right?

17:04.624 --> 17:05.725
- Come on.
- Play the game, Mags.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.427
- Get up there,
let's game it up.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.396
- All right, games.

17:09.496 --> 17:10.697
- Yay.
- There she is.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.799
- Team of one.
Team of one. Let's do it.

17:12.899 --> 17:15.468
- All right.
- Here we go.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.304
- You're gonna crush it, Mags.

17:17.404 --> 17:18.671
Okay, okay, shh, shh, shh.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.407
- Okay, everybody's
forgotten about you!

17:20.507 --> 17:21.541
- You're all alone,
you're all alone!

17:21.641 --> 17:22.609
- Your only friend's an old man!

17:22.709 --> 17:23.810
- Nobody cares about you!

17:23.910 --> 17:25.445
- All by yourself.
- You're lonely!

17:25.545 --> 17:26.679
- It's just you!
- You're lonely!

17:26.779 --> 17:28.681
- Nobody wants you!
- You're lonely.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.550
- And everyone forgot about you.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.452
- Stop it!

17:32.552 --> 17:35.722
Just stop it, for God's sake.
What's wrong with you?

17:35.822 --> 17:37.424
- I get it.

17:37.524 --> 17:39.359
Everybody's found
their special someone

17:39.459 --> 17:41.428
except for this old coot.
- No, Mags--

17:41.528 --> 17:43.363
- You guys can't get your hands
off each other,

17:43.463 --> 17:44.831
and that's nasty.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.833
And you guys can't get
your hands on each other.

17:46.933 --> 17:49.502
Well, just get it
over with and do it.

17:49.602 --> 17:52.105
At least you're not all by
yourself in your home alone.

17:52.205 --> 17:54.741
- Well, that's it, Mags.
You got the movie.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.643
- You just guessed the movie.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.411
- "Home Alone,"
that was the movie.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.113
- Yeah, you won.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.582
- Why didn't you guys
just go "ahh"?

18:02.682 --> 18:04.151
It's the poster.

18:04.251 --> 18:05.818
*

18:05.918 --> 18:07.754
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
those apps still have

18:07.854 --> 18:09.456
some life in them.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.524
- They're cream cheese.
It doesn't keep.

18:13.560 --> 18:14.861
Do you still have
feelings for Bruce?

18:14.961 --> 18:16.463
- No, of course not.

18:16.563 --> 18:17.730
- Well, then are you
in love with Cookie?

18:17.830 --> 18:19.666
'Cause I would understand that.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.668
- I don't know, I'm just--
I'm standing there looking

18:21.768 --> 18:24.537
at you guys, and it just feels
like everyone--

18:24.637 --> 18:27.740
everyone has someone
except for me, you know?

18:27.840 --> 18:30.443
- Okay, well, I thought
you weren't ready for that.

18:30.543 --> 18:33.146
- Well, I wasn't, but I--
I don't know.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.515
Maybe I am.
- Well, if we had to

18:35.615 --> 18:37.184
verbally abuse some
game night guests

18:37.284 --> 18:40.653
for you to figure that out,
then that is totally okay.

18:40.753 --> 18:43.523
And, just so you know,
if you wanna get out there,

18:43.623 --> 18:45.492
all I have to do
is put out an APB.

18:45.592 --> 18:47.627
- Let me handle this one.
- I'll probably get involved.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.762
- Why don't you get involved
with Mark's peen.

18:49.862 --> 18:52.765
This is 40, okay?

18:52.865 --> 18:54.701
- Do you really think,
when you take your clothes off,

18:54.801 --> 18:56.536
that he's gonna
run the other way?

18:56.636 --> 18:59.472
No, he's gonna jump on you
like an old hound dog.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.741
- What if I just wear
Spanx during sex?

19:03.643 --> 19:06.213
- Mark, I wanna rock your body
all night long

19:06.313 --> 19:07.714
in so many different ways.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.582
- Not right now,
we're watching "Happy Feet."

19:09.682 --> 19:11.484
- Dave, hit the road.
- Dave, you gotta go.

19:11.584 --> 19:12.752
- You gotta go.

19:12.852 --> 19:15.488
- Ugh, I wish I had somebody
to rock my body.

19:15.588 --> 19:16.923
- You will again, man.
You will again.

19:17.023 --> 19:18.891
See you later.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.661
- Mark, I am so sorry.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.430
The warm banana?
What is that?

19:23.530 --> 19:24.931
- No, I loved that.
- And then I snuck into

19:25.031 --> 19:26.599
your house,
"Dawson's Creek" style.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.435
- No, that was--
I love "Dawson's Creek."

19:28.535 --> 19:30.570
Listen to me.
I'm so happy.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.873
And I think I just got worried
that this part wouldn't work.

19:35.542 --> 19:38.745
- You haven't seen
this in a while.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.647
- Emma, I can't wait
to see this.

19:40.747 --> 19:43.450
- I know, but things are
different, you know?

19:43.550 --> 19:46.786
They're a little
wider and longer.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.855
- You think this
isn't different?

19:48.955 --> 19:51.491
- Come on, man.
- Look at this, look at this.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.493
That wasn't there before.
That's something to grab onto.

19:53.593 --> 19:54.861
Get your hands in there.
Get a hold of that, see?

19:54.961 --> 19:56.596
- All right, all right.
- How about this--

19:56.696 --> 19:57.930
this mole here?
That's new, that's interesting.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.799
- You should get
that checked out.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.701
- And, I'm sorry, check out
these chicken legs, right?

20:01.801 --> 20:03.836
I'm just going straight
chicken leg situations.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.705
It's a two-piece meal.

20:05.805 --> 20:08.608
So yeah, it's different.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.911
But have you ever thought that
it might be...

20:12.011 --> 20:13.246
much, much better?

20:13.346 --> 20:14.714
*

20:14.814 --> 20:16.849
- Get over here and
get on top of my body.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.918
*

20:20.853 --> 20:23.756
- Mags, Mark and I did it!

20:23.856 --> 20:25.358
We did the sex!

20:25.458 --> 20:26.959
And it was even better
than before 'cause

20:27.059 --> 20:28.928
I got moves now, y'all.

20:29.028 --> 20:30.463
Adult moves.

20:30.563 --> 20:34.701
What is this?

20:34.801 --> 20:37.970
"Dear Emma, you must be hungry
from all the sex.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.773
"Please enjoy this plate
of artisanal cheese.

20:40.873 --> 20:43.510
Love, your best friend,
Maggie."

20:45.312 --> 20:47.246
Oh, she knows me so well.

20:47.347 --> 20:50.317
- You're dead!

20:50.417 --> 20:52.251
- Ah!

20:52.352 --> 20:55.455
*
