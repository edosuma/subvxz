She told me about Noah stealing
Izzie's body to murder me,

23:51.586 --> 23:54.488
and she told me that
Isobel, Max and Michael

23:54.513 --> 23:56.097
covered it up with a car accident.

23:56.122 --> 24:00.464
And I might've known that Kate
and Jasmine died that night,

24:00.489 --> 24:03.986
but I was pretty messed
up, so it's all fuzzy.

24:08.919 --> 24:10.659

24:11.092 --> 24:14.121

car and staged an accident.

24:14.426 --> 24:16.056
(SCOFFS)

24:16.156 --> 24:17.536
So the whole town...

24:17.561 --> 24:20.543
Thought that I got high and
drove us off the road.

24:21.139 --> 24:24.505
People were upset. There
was a lot of backlash.

24:24.530 --> 24:26.800
Wyatt Long said a bunch
of horrible things

24:26.900 --> 24:29.972
about building a wall
between us and Mexico,

24:29.997 --> 24:32.207
and that my parents were criminals.

24:32.315 --> 24:34.136
He used to be a really nice kid, Kyle.

24:34.161 --> 24:36.411
It's like I turned him
into this monster.

24:36.499 --> 24:37.839
Look, that kind of thing

24:37.864 --> 24:39.813
isn't just coming from Wyatt Long,

24:40.768 --> 24:42.900
and it's definitely not because of you.

24:43.199 --> 24:44.817
Did Liz think I did it?

24:45.883 --> 24:47.004
I can't really...

24:47.029 --> 24:48.572
I got to go.

24:49.792 --> 24:51.356
Oh, and by the way,

24:51.381 --> 24:53.253
she got arrested, so...

24:53.278 --> 24:54.613
you might want to bail her out.

24:54.638 --> 24:57.160
- Liz got arrested?
- Yeah. Vandalism.

24:57.185 --> 24:59.125
Really out of character.

25:01.719 --> 25:04.129
VALENTI: Noah was struck by lightning

25:04.530 --> 25:06.173
directly in the heart.

25:06.333 --> 25:08.217
Now how does something like that happen,

25:08.242 --> 25:10.105
if the victim weren't
already lying down?

25:10.130 --> 25:11.230
Hard to say.

25:11.255 --> 25:13.120
Was he wearing any jewelry?

25:13.145 --> 25:14.651
Metal objects can attract lightning

25:14.676 --> 25:16.645
if the bolt is already
within a certain distance,

25:16.670 --> 25:18.684
relative to the size of
the object, of course.

25:20.081 --> 25:21.941
I haven't seen Deputy Evans

25:21.966 --> 25:24.370
since the night of the lightning storm.
Have you?

25:24.395 --> 25:26.362
We broke up. I already told you that.

25:26.387 --> 25:28.534
But you've spent time at his house.

25:29.122 --> 25:31.614
Am I under investigation, Sheriff?

25:36.260 --> 25:38.913
You were wearing this
necklace at Noah's funeral.

25:39.132 --> 25:41.784
I went by Evans's house to offer
my condolences the next day

25:41.809 --> 25:43.800
and found it outside.

25:44.349 --> 25:46.921
I messed up, okay?

25:46.946 --> 25:48.382
I...

25:49.500 --> 25:52.453
I never told Max how I
felt when I should have,

25:52.478 --> 25:55.053
and now all I can do is
wait for a second chance.

25:57.263 --> 25:59.475
That's why I've been at his house.

26:00.067 --> 26:03.855
I keep hoping today will be
the day that he comes home.

26:04.305 --> 26:07.192
Today will be the day that
I finally fix everything.

26:07.383 --> 26:09.319
I can't just give up.

26:10.693 --> 26:12.738
Not yet. I...

26:14.778 --> 26:17.068
I have to keep fighting for him.

26:18.262 --> 26:20.247
Even if it's hard, it's...

26:21.093 --> 26:23.625
harder than I could've ever imagined.

26:32.031 --> 26:33.677
Any more questions?

26:39.038 --> 26:42.686
This exercise is about
finding a new perspective.

26:43.175 --> 26:45.981
Changing the way that you see the world.

26:46.006 --> 26:47.881
I don't think I can
take much more of this.

26:47.906 --> 26:49.873

to your resting poses.

26:49.898 --> 26:51.570

26:52.015 --> 26:54.239
For our final exercise,

26:54.425 --> 26:56.756
we're going to take a look at
the fears that we wrote down.

26:56.781 --> 26:58.411
Go ahead. Take them out.

26:58.993 --> 27:03.283
Now using your newfound goddess
strength, I want you to get up

27:03.394 --> 27:05.374
and throw your fear into the fire.

27:05.399 --> 27:07.127
Set yourself free.

27:07.152 --> 27:09.004
You're a warrior.

27:14.992 --> 27:17.637
Draw upon your feminine power.

27:21.374 --> 27:23.267
Why are you hesitating, Isobel?

27:23.412 --> 27:25.222
The sooner you throw
your paper in the fire,

27:25.247 --> 27:26.628
the sooner you can leave.

27:26.684 --> 27:28.928
Look, it's not that simple, okay?

27:31.313 --> 27:33.737
I can't just throw this in the fire.

27:35.090 --> 27:37.031
I'm trapped.

27:38.564 --> 27:40.619
This is my fault.

you can choose to set yourself free.

Say it. Say, "I choose...

27:56.140 --> 27:58.803
to set myself free."

28:05.161 --> 28:07.520
I choose to set myself free.
