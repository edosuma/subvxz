00:16.917 --> 00:20.625
<i>The smell in the air.</i>
<i>It's romance.</i>

00:20.709 --> 00:23.959

00:26.000 --> 00:28.959
(gasps) Howard.
We have to get dates!

00:29.041 --> 00:31.166
(both laughing)

00:31.250 --> 00:34.083
Dates.
Dates are for dudes

00:34.166 --> 00:36.166
who don't have bros
to play vids with.

00:38.417 --> 00:40.917
(both gasping)

00:41.000 --> 00:43.959
(boy whistling)

00:44.041 --> 00:45.959
Oh!

00:46.041 --> 00:49.834
Hi. I'm Amanda Levay.

00:49.917 --> 00:53.542
This is my homeroom,
so, see ya'.

00:53.625 --> 00:56.000
-You hear that?
-She said...

00:56.083 --> 00:58.000
(both) See ya'.

00:58.083 --> 01:00.166
I'm so asking her
to the dance.

01:00.250 --> 01:02.709
-(Howard grunting)
-(Randy) Get in line.

01:02.792 --> 01:05.583
Wow. There actually
is a line.

01:05.667 --> 01:07.458
You're like,
good-looking and stuff.

01:07.542 --> 01:09.709
Prefer a man
with a dark side?

01:09.792 --> 01:11.667
Hate to zing
my own praises,

01:11.750 --> 01:13.917
but if you're into laughs,
I'm your fella.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.375
Oh, I would love to go to
the dance with each of you,

01:16.458 --> 01:18.458
but I'm looking
for the boy...

01:18.542 --> 01:24.000
No, man, who understands
true beauty.

01:24.083 --> 01:26.709
I understand true beauty.

01:26.792 --> 01:29.375
I understand I'm
looking right at it.

01:29.458 --> 01:31.250
That's exactly
the kind of cheesy line

01:31.333 --> 01:33.625
you'll never hear
if you go out with me.

01:33.709 --> 01:36.333
Mmm, if I could only
go with all of you.

01:36.417 --> 01:39.000
Alas, my heart belongs
only to whomever

01:39.083 --> 01:40.959
shows me the one thing
in this school

01:41.041 --> 01:43.375
that is truly beautiful.

01:43.458 --> 01:48.041
(all mumbling) Beautiful.

01:48.125 --> 01:50.625
-(boy) Hey, watch it!
-Freeze it, you mopes.

01:50.709 --> 01:52.875
No one goes anywhere
without a hall pass.

01:52.959 --> 01:54.834
And I hate
writing hall passes!

01:54.917 --> 01:56.125
Lucky for you,
the missus got me

01:56.208 --> 01:58.000
a McPass-Master
hall pass printer.

01:58.083 --> 02:00.375
Push the button,
get a pass.

02:03.542 --> 02:05.083
(buzzer sounding)

02:05.166 --> 02:06.709
Uh, Mr. Bannister?
Your McPass-Master

02:06.792 --> 02:09.375
seems to have, uh...
passed us over.

02:09.458 --> 02:11.875
McPass-Master has spoken.
Go sit down!

02:11.959 --> 02:13.000
Hmm?

02:13.083 --> 02:15.166
(kissing)

02:16.542 --> 02:19.000
(sniffing) Ahh.

02:19.083 --> 02:21.750
Dead flowers,
putrefied flesh,

02:21.834 --> 02:23.959
and, uh... lavender.

02:24.041 --> 02:25.625
It's her!

02:30.583 --> 02:32.041
It's the Sorcerer!

02:34.583 --> 02:36.083
(Sorcerer laughing)

02:36.166 --> 02:39.125
Yes. For eternity,
you shall...

02:39.208 --> 02:40.625
(Sorceress) ...suffer.

02:40.709 --> 02:42.083
(laughing)

02:42.166 --> 02:44.709
You dare interfere?

02:44.792 --> 02:48.333
You like to play rough,
do you?

02:48.417 --> 02:49.750
(laughing)

02:52.917 --> 02:54.917
(Sorcerer) <i>Separately,</i>
<i>we were powerful.</i>

02:55.000 --> 02:58.417
<i>Together, we were</i>
<i>nearly invincible.</i>

02:58.500 --> 03:00.208
<i>Until...</i>

03:13.000 --> 03:16.041
Ah! What have you done?

03:17.166 --> 03:21.208
Ninja banished her
to the Land of Shadows.

03:21.291 --> 03:23.750
The Sorceress
has one weakness.

03:23.834 --> 03:26.709
She cannot see true beauty.

03:26.792 --> 03:30.667
By sealing me in this tomb
with the Eye of Eternities,

03:30.750 --> 03:33.709
the Ninja thought
she'd never find me.

03:33.792 --> 03:37.000
And yet, she is near.

03:37.083 --> 03:40.834
(sniffs) This is not
truly beautiful.

03:40.917 --> 03:42.750
(Bash) It's a ham.

03:42.834 --> 03:45.041
-Real beaut, too.
-(sniffs) Uh-uh.

03:45.125 --> 03:47.458
Man, I thought Bash
had it for sure.

03:47.542 --> 03:49.208
That ham was a stunner.

03:49.291 --> 03:51.750
Someone's gonna find the most
beautiful thing in the school.

03:51.834 --> 03:53.125
It's only a matter of time.

03:53.208 --> 03:56.709
<i>Nyctimene robinsoni,</i>
the tube-nosed bat.

03:56.792 --> 03:59.166
Sculpted from ear wax.

03:59.250 --> 04:00.917
If we're gonna get out
of this classroom,

04:01.000 --> 04:01.917
we need to work together.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.083
But once we're on
the other side of that door,

04:04.166 --> 04:07.083
-we go our separate ways.
-Deal. You ready?

04:07.166 --> 04:08.583
Uh, you know it!

04:08.667 --> 04:10.875
Here we go, bloody nose,
concerned friend,

04:11.000 --> 04:12.291
and action!

04:12.375 --> 04:14.083
-(sobbing)
-It's OK, you're gonna make it.

04:14.166 --> 04:15.542
It's way better
than it looks.

04:15.625 --> 04:17.834
Halt! You may not
leave this room

04:17.917 --> 04:20.041
without McPass-Master's
permission.

04:20.125 --> 04:22.625
No time, Mr. B!
We got a gusher here.

04:24.291 --> 04:26.083
-Good luck to you.
-Oh, no.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.917
You good luck to you.

04:44.834 --> 04:47.083
Ha! You're never
gonna find it.

04:47.166 --> 04:49.083
(laughs) I'm gonna find it.
I'm gonna find it hard,

04:49.166 --> 04:51.166
and when I do
it's gonna be insane.

04:54.166 --> 04:56.041
Your Nomicon's ringing.

04:56.125 --> 04:57.125
I think you have
to take that.

04:57.208 --> 04:59.166
(groans)
I have to take that.

04:59.250 --> 05:02.458
Have fun not finding the most
beautiful thing in school.

05:02.542 --> 05:05.500
Which is what I'll be doing
while you're in the...

05:05.583 --> 05:06.959
...Nomicon.

05:08.125 --> 05:09.333
(shuddering)

05:11.041 --> 05:14.667
"The eyes can be deceived
but the nose always knows."

05:14.750 --> 05:15.875
Cute, Ninja-Nomicon.

05:15.959 --> 05:17.375
I mean, not helpful,
but cute.

05:19.959 --> 05:21.166
(groaning)

05:21.250 --> 05:22.792
Didn't find it.
Did you?

05:22.875 --> 05:25.000
No.
What'd your dumb book say?

05:25.083 --> 05:27.291
It said,
"The nose always knows."

05:27.375 --> 05:29.583
Great.
Now we know even less.

05:29.667 --> 05:31.583
It also said
the eye deceives.

05:31.667 --> 05:35.000
An eye is part of a face,
so is a nose, and ears.

05:35.083 --> 05:37.166
Did the Nomicon
say anything about ears?

05:37.250 --> 05:39.917
No! So we need something
that has eyes and a nose,

05:40.000 --> 05:42.500
but no ears.

05:42.583 --> 05:45.959
The Carp's Eye!
Above its nose and no ears.

05:46.041 --> 05:48.333
It's the most beautiful thing
in the school.

05:48.417 --> 05:50.417
It is also full
of ancient bird demon

05:50.500 --> 05:51.917
that possessed me,
remember!

05:52.000 --> 05:54.417
Yes, but... Amanda.

05:54.500 --> 05:55.834
We found it, Howard!

05:55.917 --> 05:58.000
You mean I found it,
Cunningham.

05:58.083 --> 06:00.458
You wouldn't dare!

06:00.542 --> 06:03.875
-I gotta show you something.
-(Randy) Hey, Amanda!

06:03.959 --> 06:04.959
Amanda!
(grunting)

06:05.041 --> 06:06.875
-(Howard laughing)
-(Amanda) Hey.

06:06.959 --> 06:09.000
-What's going on?
-No.

06:09.083 --> 06:10.834
You are not
leaving this classroom

06:10.917 --> 06:12.959
under any circumstances.

06:14.834 --> 06:18.041
McPass-Master has spoken.

06:20.959 --> 06:22.041
(growling)

06:24.333 --> 06:25.333
Well?

06:25.417 --> 06:26.959
(sniffing) Mmm.

06:27.041 --> 06:30.041
(chuckles) And to think
it was under my nose

06:30.125 --> 06:32.875
-all this time.
-I know, right?

06:32.959 --> 06:35.500
You see, Amanda,
the eye can be deceived,

06:35.583 --> 06:39.333
but the nose always knows.
That's how I found it.

06:39.417 --> 06:41.917
-I found it.
-But really, I found it.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.709
-Let's talk dance.
-(kissing)

06:47.709 --> 06:49.041
-Boys?
-(Howard) Mm-hmm?

06:49.125 --> 06:50.375
(Randy) Yes?

06:50.458 --> 06:52.250
Leave me!

06:52.333 --> 06:55.083
(both) OK.

06:55.166 --> 06:59.625
To once more do horrible,
terrible things together.

07:02.083 --> 07:03.458
(Sorcerer) Ahh.

07:03.542 --> 07:07.041
Such sweet misery.

07:07.125 --> 07:08.417
(laughing)

07:12.125 --> 07:13.792
(shouting)

07:13.875 --> 07:16.542
Hey, Amanda never told us
who's taking her to the dance.

07:16.625 --> 07:19.333
I should probably
go back and ask her.

07:19.417 --> 07:22.208
Hoo-hoo, no, you don't.
I'll go ask her.

07:22.375 --> 07:25.083
What the juice?!

07:28.500 --> 07:30.000
(groaning)

07:30.083 --> 07:31.959
She's all yours,
Cunningham.

07:32.041 --> 07:34.291
Uh, Amanda,
or scary skull lady,

07:34.375 --> 07:37.291
or whoever you are.
It is on.

07:37.375 --> 07:39.166
Smoke bomb!

07:41.125 --> 07:43.083
(grunts)

07:43.166 --> 07:44.917
Ah, Ninja.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.041
I've waited centuries
for this.

07:47.125 --> 07:50.667
Then you waited centuries
to get your butt kicked!

07:50.750 --> 07:52.750
Ninja Butt Kick!

07:56.125 --> 07:57.458
Ninja.

07:59.041 --> 08:01.500
Amanda.

08:01.583 --> 08:02.583
Not Amanda!

08:04.709 --> 08:06.500
Oh!

08:06.583 --> 08:10.667
Well, well. You can resist
the Sorceress, but...

08:10.750 --> 08:13.417
...Amanda wants you
to stand perfectly still.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.750
Amanda.

08:15.834 --> 08:17.625
Can you do that for me,
sweetie?

08:17.709 --> 08:19.125
Uh-huh.

08:19.208 --> 08:22.625
Curse you for making me
hold this repulsive form.

08:22.709 --> 08:24.750
It's so not repulsive.

08:24.834 --> 08:27.000
You're only slowing down
my reunion with...

08:27.083 --> 08:29.041
...the Sorcerer.

08:29.125 --> 08:30.750
Wait, the Sorcerer?

08:30.834 --> 08:33.500
The Sorcerer's down there?

08:33.583 --> 08:35.000
Ninja Sp...
(groaning)

08:35.083 --> 08:38.542
Eyes deceived.
Can't use eyes.

08:38.625 --> 08:40.542
But the nose knows.

08:40.625 --> 08:42.834
Ninja Smell-O-Vision.

08:42.917 --> 08:45.291
Wow. Anyone tell you
that you smell bad?

08:45.375 --> 08:47.250
Like really bad.

08:49.083 --> 08:51.750
Ninja Duck, Ninja Flip.

08:53.208 --> 08:55.500
Ninja Slide, Ninja Slide.
Yeah, baby.

08:55.583 --> 08:57.000
Ah, come on!

08:57.083 --> 08:58.792
(laughing)

09:00.750 --> 09:03.125
Boys. Boys, I need help.

09:03.208 --> 09:04.750
Boys?
(sniffing)

09:06.041 --> 09:07.542
(Howard) We're here,
my love.

09:07.625 --> 09:09.458
(Bash) Get the Ninja!

09:09.542 --> 09:11.458
(Howard) Save Amanda.

09:11.542 --> 09:13.000
Howard, Bash?

09:13.083 --> 09:14.250
Bucky?

09:14.333 --> 09:16.000
OK, guys,
I know Amanda's hot.

09:16.083 --> 09:18.041
Super hot,
but she's not...

09:22.834 --> 09:24.000
(cracking)

09:24.083 --> 09:25.000
Yes!

09:25.083 --> 09:26.417
(Bash) Elbow drop!

09:26.500 --> 09:28.083
(all grunting)

09:28.166 --> 09:30.500
Ninja Taste Of
Her Own Medicine.

09:30.583 --> 09:33.875
Uh, fellas.
(kissing)

09:33.959 --> 09:36.458
The Ninja's moving in
on our girl.

09:36.542 --> 09:38.375
-Get him!
-(Amanda) No!

09:38.458 --> 09:41.166
Get back, you animals!

09:48.125 --> 09:49.792
Ninja Flip.

09:52.750 --> 09:54.417
(screaming)

09:55.458 --> 09:58.667
No!

09:58.750 --> 09:59.834
(Ninja) You guys OK?

09:59.917 --> 10:03.166
Amanda.
You can't have Amanda!

10:03.250 --> 10:05.166
Trust me,
I don't want her.

10:05.250 --> 10:06.542
(hissing)

10:06.625 --> 10:10.083
Whoa. She ain't pretty.
She's ugly.

10:10.166 --> 10:12.917
OK, Sorceress.
Time to finish this.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.834
Soon, Ninja.
The fight has only begun.

10:16.917 --> 10:19.083
(roaring)

10:19.166 --> 10:21.417
-(sniffing)
-(both) Ew!

10:21.500 --> 10:24.041
Smells like baloney
and dead fish.

10:24.125 --> 10:26.375
(Randy) The nose did not
need to know that.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.041
(Heidi) Thanks to the Ninja,

10:29.125 --> 10:32.208
tonight's dance really is
under the stars.

10:32.291 --> 10:34.959
Cunningham,
we can never let a girl

10:35.041 --> 10:36.625
come between us again.
Deal?

10:36.709 --> 10:37.792
Deal.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.917
Wanna go to my house
and get our Grave Punch on?

10:42.000 --> 10:43.625
Hey. Wanna dance?

10:43.709 --> 10:45.625
-Sure do.
-She asked me.

10:45.709 --> 10:47.333
Come on, Cunningham,
let me have this one.

10:47.417 --> 10:48.667
Forget it.

10:51.250 --> 10:56.375
800 years has done nothing to
diminish your strength, Ninja.

10:56.458 --> 10:58.875
So I must regain mine.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.500
(laughing)

11:01.792 --> 11:03.709
(bell ringing)

11:03.792 --> 11:07.500
I said, "Ma, I know
hand cream's expensive.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.792
Why do you think
I clipped the coupon?"

11:09.875 --> 11:11.959
-(Bash) Hey, that guy!
-(all gasping)

11:14.792 --> 11:18.291
I just remembered
I have an appointment.

11:18.375 --> 11:19.375
(gasps)

11:20.333 --> 11:23.375
Uh... what's up, Bash?

11:23.458 --> 11:25.083
Wanna be friends together?

11:25.166 --> 11:26.792
Um, of course.
Yeah, I mean,

11:26.875 --> 11:28.959
who wouldn't want
to be your friend?

11:29.041 --> 11:31.834
Hmm. Hmm?

11:31.917 --> 11:34.875
(shrieking)

11:34.959 --> 11:36.000
Wha... what?!

11:36.083 --> 11:37.709
What the juice was that?

11:37.792 --> 11:40.291
You thought I was gonna
shake your hand regular.

11:40.375 --> 11:42.792
But instead,
you got 'lectrocuted.

11:42.875 --> 11:45.667
Ha-ha, oh.
I guess you got me.

11:45.750 --> 11:47.333
Yeah, I'm gonna be
getting you a lot.

11:47.417 --> 11:49.166
'Cause I got all these wicked funny
pranking things

11:49.250 --> 11:50.875
from my stepdad's
science guy.

11:50.959 --> 11:53.875
It's Bash's Prank-fest!
And I'm Bash. Yeah!

11:53.959 --> 11:55.458
(laughing)

11:55.542 --> 11:57.500
-(groaning)
-Hmm?

11:57.583 --> 12:00.125
I already hate Prank-fest.

12:04.083 --> 12:05.500
(laughing)

12:07.250 --> 12:10.208
(giggles) "Kick me."
How clever.

12:10.291 --> 12:12.917
Let me guess.
Now I get kicked.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.625
How'd you know?

12:15.834 --> 12:16.917
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

12:23.458 --> 12:25.250
(shrieking)

12:25.333 --> 12:28.583
My Twirl Captain assured me
this was impossible!

12:28.667 --> 12:29.959
(all laughing)

12:38.000 --> 12:39.875
Bash is close.

12:39.959 --> 12:41.667
I can feel it.

12:41.750 --> 12:42.875
Relax, Cunningham.

12:42.959 --> 12:44.875
It's not that hard
to outsmart Bash.

12:44.959 --> 12:46.792
You just gotta
keep your eyes open.

12:46.875 --> 12:48.625
-(beeping)
-(Howard) Huh?

12:48.709 --> 12:50.500
Incoming!

12:50.583 --> 12:52.333
I'm hit! It's...

12:52.417 --> 12:54.333
Uh... what is this?

12:54.417 --> 12:56.875
(Bash) Sticky Sparkle.
You got pranked!

12:56.959 --> 12:57.959
(all laughing)

12:58.041 --> 12:59.041
(groaning)

13:01.125 --> 13:02.291
How Bruce would it be
to prank Bash

13:02.375 --> 13:04.041
in front of
the entire school?

13:04.125 --> 13:07.250
On a scale of one to ten,
that would be a Bruce-leven!

13:07.333 --> 13:09.083
We need something special.

13:09.166 --> 13:12.166
Something guaranteed
to deliver mega humiliation.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.583
If we pranked Bash,
we'd be looking at

13:14.667 --> 13:18.000
sophomore-level respect,
fo sho!

13:18.083 --> 13:20.000
Maybe even unpopular junior.

13:20.083 --> 13:21.583
Hmm?

13:21.667 --> 13:23.291
Think on that.
I gotta take a Ninja-Nomicon.

13:35.875 --> 13:36.875
(Randy) Huh?

13:41.375 --> 13:43.041
(shouting)

13:45.125 --> 13:47.166
"He who crosses the line

13:47.250 --> 13:49.667
must prepare for the fall
that follows."

13:49.750 --> 13:52.792
You're right, Nomicon.
Bash has crossed the line,

13:52.875 --> 13:55.250
and he must fall.
Big time!

13:55.333 --> 13:56.959
(shouting)

13:59.083 --> 14:01.083
(groaning)

14:01.166 --> 14:02.625
Howard, I know what
we're going to do.

14:02.709 --> 14:04.041
Oh, good.
'Cause I got glitter

14:04.125 --> 14:06.125
in places I don't
want to think about.

14:06.208 --> 14:07.583
-You mean on your...
-Yes.

14:07.667 --> 14:08.750
-And in your...
-Yes.

14:08.834 --> 14:10.000
And up your...

14:10.083 --> 14:12.792
Said I don't want
to think about it!

14:12.875 --> 14:16.208
Once we're done with Bash,
he's never gonna prank again.

14:16.291 --> 14:18.750
If you guys pull this off,
you deserve...

14:18.834 --> 14:21.834
-Sophomore-level respect?
-At least.

14:21.917 --> 14:24.083
Fish sticks,
I'm eating you first.

14:24.166 --> 14:25.917
Then I'm coming after you,
apple sauce.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.917
And don't think you're
escaping, chocolate milk.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.291
OK, he's coming.
Act natural.

14:30.375 --> 14:33.333
(all muttering, laughing)

14:39.041 --> 14:41.500
Whoa! Flippin' rocks!

14:41.583 --> 14:44.083
Hey! I got gravy
in my no-no spots!

14:44.166 --> 14:45.166
(shouting)

14:51.000 --> 14:53.083
Smashing success,
Cunningham.

14:53.166 --> 14:55.125
Wait for it.

15:02.792 --> 15:05.458
Never bring a glitter bomb
to a gravy and bean fight.

15:05.542 --> 15:08.959
(all laughing)

15:09.041 --> 15:10.667
Pranks are only funny
when they happen

15:10.750 --> 15:12.083
to people
who aren't Bash.

15:12.166 --> 15:15.125
We did it, Howard.
The ultimate prank.

15:15.208 --> 15:19.125
Yeah, it's amazing.
I feel like a whole new person.

15:19.208 --> 15:20.667
(all chanting)
Randy. Howard.

15:20.750 --> 15:22.291
Party at my house
this weekend.

15:22.375 --> 15:23.625
Sophomores and above.

15:23.709 --> 15:26.333
But we can make an exception
for you guys.

15:26.417 --> 15:28.792
(both) Sophomore-level respect!

15:32.333 --> 15:33.875
(cawing)

15:33.959 --> 15:34.875
(groaning)

15:34.959 --> 15:38.375
That one's played out.
Spin it again.

15:38.458 --> 15:40.333
Hannibal, Bashford called.

15:40.417 --> 15:42.500
He says the pranks
are such a hit.

15:42.583 --> 15:45.458
His schoolmates
are asking for more.

15:45.542 --> 15:47.709
I've already given him
every product

15:47.792 --> 15:51.375
from the McFist Industries
Novelty and Tomfoolery Division.

15:51.458 --> 15:53.000
Oh, poo.

15:53.083 --> 15:55.333
You made her poo, Viceroy,
not good.

15:55.417 --> 15:58.500
What's this thingamabob?
Give him this!

15:58.583 --> 16:00.083
That's not a prank.

16:00.166 --> 16:03.083
That's an untested
molecular transmogrifier.

16:03.166 --> 16:05.041
It fires a ray
that randomly transforms

16:05.125 --> 16:08.458
the molecules of one object
into another object.

16:09.792 --> 16:12.375
Perfect! I love it.
Give it to the boy.

16:12.458 --> 16:14.208
The MT is
a highly unpredictable

16:14.291 --> 16:16.208
and extremely dangerous
apparatus.

16:16.291 --> 16:17.709
-(kissing)
-(exclaiming)

16:17.792 --> 16:19.208
I said give it
to the boy!

16:19.291 --> 16:20.917
Mm-kay.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.875
(laughing)

16:24.125 --> 16:25.500
Yeah.

16:25.583 --> 16:27.166
I'm gonna call you
Prank-Zooka.

16:27.250 --> 16:30.542
You are advised to read
this instruction manual.

16:30.625 --> 16:33.041
Yeah. Now smash that pie
in your face!

16:33.125 --> 16:34.083
(sighing)

16:34.166 --> 16:36.750
Whoo! I love this thing.

16:36.834 --> 16:37.917
Come on, Prank-Zooka.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.375
Let's go prank
those prankers

16:39.458 --> 16:41.750
what pranked Bash Johnson,
with a prank!

16:41.834 --> 16:45.125
-(all cheering)
-(fanfare playing)

16:45.208 --> 16:47.959
Sophomore-level respect.

16:49.333 --> 16:51.000
Till I find out
who pranked me,

16:51.083 --> 16:54.083
I'm gonna prank the cheese
out of the whole school!

16:57.375 --> 16:59.417
-Yeah!
-(kid) Oh, no!

16:59.500 --> 17:02.709
How am I supposed
to grade these dishes?

17:02.792 --> 17:04.959
(shouting)

17:05.041 --> 17:07.792
Hope you enjoyed your
sophomore-level respect

17:07.875 --> 17:09.834
-while it lasted.
-Don't worry.

17:09.917 --> 17:12.333
Bash will never find out we
were the ones who pranked him.

17:12.417 --> 17:14.834
You pranked me.
Want to know how I found out?

17:14.917 --> 17:16.583
I was standing right here
when you said it.

17:16.667 --> 17:18.959
-(shouts)
-Nice.

17:19.041 --> 17:21.291
Listen, Bash, surely
we can work this out...

17:22.458 --> 17:24.083
No!

17:24.166 --> 17:26.041
It's doing stuff
it ain't supposed to do.

17:28.500 --> 17:31.417
(both gasping)

17:31.500 --> 17:32.500
(shouts)

17:34.750 --> 17:35.750
(screaming)

17:38.375 --> 17:40.917
My worst nightmare
has come to life!

17:41.000 --> 17:41.917
(roaring)

17:44.625 --> 17:46.750
(screaming) Help me!

17:49.208 --> 17:50.959
(Howard) Help me!

17:51.875 --> 17:52.959
Hang on, buddy.

17:53.041 --> 17:56.083
Oh, it's on my face,
it's on my face!

17:56.166 --> 17:58.250
-What are you doing?
-It's toilet water.

17:58.333 --> 18:01.333
I know it's toilet water.
I'm swimming in it!

18:05.000 --> 18:07.917
Toilet, I know I've done some
unspeakable things to you,

18:08.000 --> 18:10.458
but this time
you went too far!

18:12.125 --> 18:13.125
(all screaming)

18:22.166 --> 18:24.333
(Julian shrieking)
It's my hair!

18:24.417 --> 18:26.917
-It's in my hair!
-Ninja Bat Slap!

18:27.000 --> 18:28.583
Ninja! Squeezing me.

18:30.959 --> 18:33.333
(Bash screaming)

18:33.417 --> 18:35.458
Get away from me,
crazy walking gun!

18:36.083 --> 18:37.083
Huh?

18:37.166 --> 18:38.417
-(farting)
-What?

18:38.500 --> 18:40.625
Ha-ha!
The Ninja ripped one.

18:40.709 --> 18:42.917
-More than one.
-(all laughing)

18:43.000 --> 18:44.750
No, that's not me,
I swear.

18:44.834 --> 18:46.458
-(farting sound)
-(Bash laughing)

18:46.542 --> 18:48.458
Seriously, what'd
you eat for lunch?

18:48.542 --> 18:51.000
Still not me.
Enough of this.

18:51.083 --> 18:53.542
You're going down,
Prank-Zooka. Ninja Ring.

18:55.333 --> 18:56.917
(farting sounds)

18:57.000 --> 18:58.125
(laughing)

19:03.208 --> 19:05.625
Why did you bring
this thing to school?

19:05.709 --> 19:07.542
Don't blame me,
my pranks were funny.

19:07.625 --> 19:10.000
Them two shoobs violated
the spirit and camaraderie

19:10.083 --> 19:12.709
-of Bash's Prank-Fest.
-(farting sounds)

19:12.792 --> 19:14.083
"He who crosses the line

19:14.166 --> 19:16.417
must prepare for the fall
that follows."

19:16.500 --> 19:18.458
Yeah, pranking Bash
like that

19:18.542 --> 19:21.041
may have been a bit
over the line.

19:21.125 --> 19:22.375
(farting sounds)

19:22.458 --> 19:23.625
(screaming)

19:27.125 --> 19:29.208
(gasps) OK, a lot
over the line.

19:29.291 --> 19:31.458
How do I stop this thing?

19:31.542 --> 19:35.291
"Fall that follows."
He's gotta follow me.

19:35.375 --> 19:38.041
Oh, Prank-Zooka.

19:39.041 --> 19:41.709
Ninja Catch Me If You Can.

19:46.458 --> 19:47.959
(chickens clucking)

19:48.041 --> 19:49.667
No, no, no, no!

19:53.667 --> 19:56.208
-(panting)
-(roaring)

19:57.667 --> 19:59.000
Hey.

19:59.083 --> 19:59.959
Come and get me.

20:02.709 --> 20:04.542
Should have stretched first.

20:08.083 --> 20:09.583
Smoke bomb!

20:09.667 --> 20:12.000
You just crossed the line.

20:12.083 --> 20:14.083
And here comes the fall.

20:19.792 --> 20:21.333
You got pranked!

20:21.417 --> 20:23.291
(crackling)

20:26.792 --> 20:28.125
-(gasping)
-(buzzing)

20:31.041 --> 20:33.083
(grunts, giggling)

20:35.500 --> 20:38.083
I think we've seen that pranks
can cross the line.

20:38.166 --> 20:41.208
So I say no more pranks.
Everybody cool with that?

20:41.291 --> 20:44.917
-(all agreeing)
-Bash?

20:45.000 --> 20:47.083
-(shrieking)
-(all laughing)

20:47.166 --> 20:48.792
Ninja Electro-Ball.

20:48.875 --> 20:51.166
Oh, and...
smoke bomb!

20:55.917 --> 20:57.166
(McFist) Viceroy!

20:57.250 --> 20:59.125
Guess who got into trouble
with his wife

20:59.208 --> 21:00.875
because your
Tranma-whatchmacallit

21:00.959 --> 21:02.667
got his stepson suspended!

21:02.750 --> 21:04.959
Ooh, I do like
guessing games.

21:05.041 --> 21:07.834
Then guess who's
Bash-sitting all week!

21:07.917 --> 21:09.375
Sweet. Monster maker!

21:09.458 --> 21:11.125
I was having
such a nice day.

21:11.208 --> 21:12.417
-What's it do?
-Ahh!

21:12.500 --> 21:15.291
-Hey, check it out.
-(shrieking)

21:15.375 --> 21:17.083
(roaring)

21:17.166 --> 21:19.417
(laughing)

21:22.125 --> 21:24.667
Wow, people
are pretty mad at us

21:24.750 --> 21:27.000
for causing Bash
to unleash the Prank-Zooka.

21:27.083 --> 21:29.875
Uh, how long do you think
they're gonna hold a grudge?

21:29.959 --> 21:31.667
(kid 1) Flour bomb!

21:31.750 --> 21:34.375
-I'm sure that's it.
-(kid 2) Jelly bomb!

21:34.458 --> 21:35.625
OK, never mind.

21:35.709 --> 21:37.834
Oh, look at us,
Cunningham.

21:37.917 --> 21:39.542
Was it really worth
all this just to get

21:39.625 --> 21:42.417
sophomore-level respect?

21:44.041 --> 21:45.458
(both) Totally!
