00:56.561 --> 00:58.528
- You told us that you fought
in your mother's kitchen

00:58.563 --> 00:59.595
with your brother.

00:59.630 --> 01:00.629
Is that correct?

01:00.664 --> 01:01.696
- Yes.

01:03.304 --> 01:05.436
- And you would have
us believe that this brother

01:05.471 --> 01:08.274
also murdered your mother
just several minutes earlier?

01:11.873 --> 01:12.707
- You're weak!

01:15.250 --> 01:17.613
- Yes.

01:17.648 --> 01:19.648
- And you tried
to save her life?

01:23.951 --> 01:25.555
- Uh.

01:25.590 --> 01:26.622
Yes.

01:29.397 --> 01:32.298
- That's a very noble
thing to do, Mr. McCubbin,

01:32.333 --> 01:36.467
but tell me, how is it
possible that Ms. Sanchez,

01:36.502 --> 01:39.503
Mr. Kirkpatrick, neither
of them saw any sign

01:39.538 --> 01:41.406
of your brother when they
responded to the call

01:41.441 --> 01:42.539
at your mother's house?

01:43.608 --> 01:45.575
- I don't know.

01:58.623 --> 02:00.689
- This is
Dr. Alfred Hunter.

02:04.332 --> 02:07.630
Subject is Lester
A. McCubbin, male.

02:07.665 --> 02:09.335
Age of 29.

02:11.735 --> 02:14.703
Date is February 2, 2018.

02:16.641 --> 02:17.838
Oregon State Hospital.

02:23.252 --> 02:24.350
When we met this morning,

02:24.385 --> 02:26.550
you mentioned someone
named Addison.

02:30.523 --> 02:32.523
Why don't you tell
me about him, Lester?

02:41.435 --> 02:42.269
- Les.

02:45.340 --> 02:46.372
- I'm sorry?

02:49.443 --> 02:50.244
- Les.

02:51.775 --> 02:52.873
I've always been Les.

02:54.844 --> 02:56.580
- Of course, Les.

03:09.331 --> 03:11.397
Tell me about your
earliest memories with-

03:11.432 --> 03:13.234
- I've never
been without him.

03:14.897 --> 03:16.798
We were born six minutes apart.

03:20.804 --> 03:23.409
- Are you identical
or fraternal twins?

03:25.743 --> 03:26.841
- Fraternal.

03:39.823 --> 03:40.756
He looks like Mom.

03:44.795 --> 03:46.465
- What was Mom like?

03:48.436 --> 03:49.732
- She loved Addison.

03:56.477 --> 03:57.773
He was always her favorite.

04:04.947 --> 04:06.881
- Was
your father around?

04:06.916 --> 04:08.014
- Mom!

04:08.049 --> 04:10.621
Addie, share, please.

04:10.656 --> 04:12.656
Oh!

04:12.691 --> 04:14.592
- Dad didn't
like either of us much.

04:14.627 --> 04:16.528
- Les! Get in the house.

04:17.597 --> 04:20.400
- Did your father
physically abuse you?

04:28.102 --> 04:31.774
- I mean, unless
you count spanking.

04:31.809 --> 04:33.006
- How many times
have I told you?

04:33.041 --> 04:34.744
Don't encourage him.

04:37.716 --> 04:40.354
- It's a harmless game, John.

04:40.389 --> 04:41.883
Addison's-
- Don't.

04:41.918 --> 04:43.786
I don't want to hear that name.

04:44.755 --> 04:45.920
When are you gonna get
that through your head?

04:45.955 --> 04:47.592
- Did he spank Addison?

04:47.627 --> 04:48.725
- The boy's not right.

04:49.629 --> 04:50.694
- Oh, no.

04:50.729 --> 04:52.564
He mostly ignored him.

04:54.898 --> 04:57.833
Besides, Dad could
never catch him.

04:59.936 --> 05:01.408
- Okay.

05:01.443 --> 05:03.938
And why do you think
your father ignored

05:03.973 --> 05:05.346
Addison and not you?

05:08.747 --> 05:09.581
- I don't know.

05:12.146 --> 05:13.519
- Maybe he was jealous.

05:14.720 --> 05:16.984
- Jealous?

05:17.019 --> 05:17.853
Of whom?

05:20.858 --> 05:22.825
- Of Addie.

05:22.860 --> 05:23.626
- You got me, Les.

05:23.661 --> 05:25.960
- Gotta catch
me first, nerd!

05:28.437 --> 05:30.063
- What the hell
is wrong with you?

05:33.640 --> 05:34.969
How many times have I told you?

05:35.004 --> 05:35.970
- Sorry.

05:36.005 --> 05:37.972
- Don't run in the house.

05:38.007 --> 05:38.940
- Sorry.

05:38.975 --> 05:40.612
- If you do that again...

05:43.144 --> 05:44.880
Go to your room. Right now!

05:51.889 --> 05:54.791
- You said your
mother loved Addison.

05:54.826 --> 05:56.397
How did she treat you?

05:59.193 --> 06:01.765
- She, she was
patient, I guess.

06:02.900 --> 06:03.932
Uh, kind.

06:06.200 --> 06:09.036
But I could tell
I was in the way.

06:12.910 --> 06:15.845
- Just give
your father some time

06:15.880 --> 06:16.879
to unwind from work.

06:19.620 --> 06:21.917
I'll bring your dinner
after he's eaten, okay?

06:31.863 --> 06:34.468
- Did you resent
Addison for this?

06:34.503 --> 06:35.667
- No.

06:35.702 --> 06:37.031
Never.

06:37.066 --> 06:38.197
How could I?

06:38.232 --> 06:39.935
We're, we're soulmates.

06:42.742 --> 06:43.939
We were inseparable.

06:48.913 --> 06:49.747
- Ah, dude!

06:49.782 --> 06:50.946
- Come on!

06:50.981 --> 06:52.618
Last one to the end
doesn't get any dinner!

07:00.089 --> 07:01.121
- You're dead, Addie!

07:13.905 --> 07:14.739
- Dog.

07:16.138 --> 07:17.236
- It's a dog.

07:19.614 --> 07:20.976
I see man climbing a hill.

07:22.210 --> 07:25.046
- Yeah, there's a
guy behind him, too.

07:25.081 --> 07:26.179
- It's his brother.

07:34.596 --> 07:37.025
I see a cloud that
looks like a waffle.

07:37.060 --> 07:38.994
- That does look like a waffle.

07:39.029 --> 07:40.930
- You see it too, yeah.
- Yeah, I see it.

07:40.965 --> 07:42.800
- It's a waffle cloud.

07:42.835 --> 07:43.867
- Yeah, it's weird.

07:43.902 --> 07:46.100
I've never seen a waffle cloud.

07:46.135 --> 07:46.969
- Yeah.

07:48.610 --> 07:50.775
- What was
school like for you?

07:50.810 --> 07:51.644
- Normal.

07:52.845 --> 07:53.910
Got good grades.

07:56.145 --> 07:57.947
He was way more popular, though.

08:00.083 --> 08:01.588
- What about
after high school?

08:01.623 --> 08:03.117
Did you go to college together?

08:07.123 --> 08:10.058
- When we turned 18, we
pretty much left right away.

08:11.996 --> 08:13.028
Portland State.

08:13.932 --> 08:14.766
- Stuck together.

08:17.199 --> 08:18.869
- You're a sucker, Les.

08:19.838 --> 08:22.268
Seriously, you think
you're gonna settle down,

08:22.303 --> 08:25.810
produce 2.3 children and
live happily ever after?

08:25.845 --> 08:27.174
- It could happen.

08:28.848 --> 08:31.046
- You'll run screaming
at the first dirty diaper.

08:31.081 --> 08:32.146
- Shut up, Addie.

08:34.084 --> 08:36.084
- Hey, let me
tell you about this guy

08:36.119 --> 08:37.987
in my Chinese class, Rick.

08:38.923 --> 08:40.825
We showed up at the
same job interview today

08:40.860 --> 08:44.796
and we got to talking,
and I think he likes me.

08:44.831 --> 08:46.600
- You think every
guy likes you, Addie,

08:46.635 --> 08:48.327
and then you meet his
wife or his girlfriend.

08:48.362 --> 08:50.164
- Screw you.

08:50.199 --> 08:52.639
You're hardly the one to be
giving relationship advice.

08:52.674 --> 08:54.905
- Last time you messed
around with some guy,

08:54.940 --> 08:56.005
I'm the one who ended
up with his wife

08:56.040 --> 08:57.809
crying on my shoulder.

08:57.844 --> 08:59.008
- See, we make a good team.

08:59.043 --> 08:59.942
We compliment each other.

08:59.978 --> 09:02.715
- That was after she
tried to beat me up.

09:02.750 --> 09:05.080
I'm not doing whatever
this is turning into.

09:05.115 --> 09:06.983
Uh!

09:07.018 --> 09:09.689
- Rick wants to go
clubbing this weekend.

09:09.724 --> 09:11.251
He invited us both
to come along.

09:11.286 --> 09:12.956
- I don't even know the guy.

09:12.991 --> 09:14.826
- Yeah, so I told him you were
cool and he invited us both.

09:14.861 --> 09:17.290
- Ugh, you're so annoying.

09:17.325 --> 09:19.160
- So, you in?

09:19.195 --> 09:20.161
- No, I'm not in.

09:20.196 --> 09:22.328
Christie has her peace corps-

09:22.363 --> 09:24.935
- I already told
him we'd both go.

09:24.970 --> 09:26.035
- Tell him I can't.

09:27.137 --> 09:28.400
- Oh, come on, Les.

09:28.435 --> 09:30.237
I need you there
for moral support

09:30.272 --> 09:32.173
in case it doesn't go well.

09:32.208 --> 09:33.845
- Christie needs moral support.

09:33.880 --> 09:35.715
- Christie needs
to learn to commit.

09:35.750 --> 09:37.178
Stick the landing, sister.

09:37.213 --> 09:38.344
Come on, Les.

09:41.118 --> 09:42.150
It'll be fun.

09:42.185 --> 09:42.984
- It won't!

09:43.019 --> 09:44.152
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

09:44.187 --> 09:45.120
- It'll be really gay.

09:49.995 --> 09:51.830
I might go for a walk.

10:02.106 --> 10:03.336
- Hey there.

10:03.371 --> 10:06.911
- Hi.

10:06.946 --> 10:08.407
- What can I get ya?

10:08.442 --> 10:10.717
- Whiskey, I think.

10:25.866 --> 10:26.700
Oh!

10:35.271 --> 10:36.204
- Another one?

10:40.342 --> 10:41.748
Tough day?

10:41.783 --> 10:44.377
- Yeah,
something like that.

10:46.887 --> 10:50.185
- Why don't you let
me take care of you?

10:51.419 --> 10:52.220
I'm Lisa.

10:53.454 --> 10:54.255
- Hi.

11:07.974 --> 11:09.171
What are you doing?

11:09.206 --> 11:11.041
Where's Rick?

11:12.341 --> 11:14.242
- Back there writing
a new phone book.

11:18.116 --> 11:19.478
- Shouldn't you be with him?

11:22.417 --> 11:23.251
- Moral support.

11:48.949 --> 11:49.750
- What you doing?

11:51.050 --> 11:53.149
- Ruining
everything, apparently.

12:10.234 --> 12:11.398
- Did you get him pregnant?

12:13.039 --> 12:13.873
- Well, I tried.

12:21.146 --> 12:21.980
He left.

12:30.188 --> 12:33.321
- If he left,

12:33.356 --> 12:34.553
how are we getting home?

12:42.431 --> 12:43.496
- Breakfast.

12:47.205 --> 12:49.469
Whoa, tell me about it.

12:52.573 --> 12:54.980
At least we had fun.

12:59.250 --> 13:01.283
I saw you flirting
with that bartender.

13:03.122 --> 13:06.156
- She was doing her
job, so I did mine.

13:07.357 --> 13:12.360
- You're in love.

13:14.463 --> 13:16.067
- Oh.

13:16.102 --> 13:16.936
Oh.

13:19.534 --> 13:20.940
I'm looking for it.

13:20.975 --> 13:22.436
Just can't find my pockets.

13:24.011 --> 13:28.013
Oops. There it is.

13:28.048 --> 13:31.214
I can't read that.

13:31.249 --> 13:35.350
Okay. Oops.

13:51.467 --> 13:53.170
I have to pee, brother.

14:11.454 --> 14:12.486
Whoa.

14:12.521 --> 14:13.421
- Hey, honey.

14:14.622 --> 14:16.391
You look like you
could use a hand.

14:17.724 --> 14:18.558
What's your name?

14:21.200 --> 14:22.133
- Hey, I'm Addison.

14:24.665 --> 14:26.566
- See? That's more like it.

14:26.601 --> 14:27.974
- You don't know where
that hand has been.

14:29.406 --> 14:31.604
- It's not where
the hand has been,

14:31.639 --> 14:34.145
but where it could
be that counts.

14:34.180 --> 14:35.509
- Woo! Whoa.

14:36.413 --> 14:39.216
Um, it's just,

14:39.251 --> 14:42.186
mister, miss, whatever.

14:42.221 --> 14:44.584
I don't want to disappoint you.

14:44.619 --> 14:45.684
- Hey, it's no problem, bro.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.191
Ripped off me a wad of cash.

14:47.226 --> 14:50.128
- Hey, put that away.

14:51.659 --> 14:53.296
Aw, hell.

15:03.506 --> 15:06.441
♪ Lady was a dude ♪

15:06.476 --> 15:08.311
- What the hell?

15:10.183 --> 15:12.513
- The hooker you tried
to pick up was a dude.

15:12.548 --> 15:13.679
- I didn't do it.

15:13.714 --> 15:15.285
- That's what they all say.

15:16.255 --> 15:17.716
- I didn't pick anyone up.

15:17.751 --> 15:20.026
- Not according to the fuzz.

15:20.061 --> 15:21.489
And they have the
cash to prove it.

15:21.524 --> 15:25.064
My money, by the way.

15:25.099 --> 15:27.594
- We lost our scholarship
because of the arrest.

15:52.093 --> 15:52.718
- What?

15:55.789 --> 15:56.623
No!

16:17.481 --> 16:18.513
Addison?

16:27.557 --> 16:29.359
Ah!

16:29.394 --> 16:30.228
Anyone!

16:45.575 --> 16:48.444
- And what did you
do after college?

16:49.546 --> 16:50.512
- I waited tables.

16:53.616 --> 16:54.747
Good evening.

16:54.782 --> 16:57.585
Our special tonight
is on Lifetime.

16:57.620 --> 16:58.454
Tune in.

17:00.293 --> 17:01.655
Are you doing okay?

17:03.164 --> 17:03.789
Okay.

17:07.894 --> 17:08.794
- Good night.

17:08.829 --> 17:10.631
- Good night.

17:22.645 --> 17:24.744
- Oh!

17:24.779 --> 17:27.285
- Yeah, that's what
she said.

17:27.320 --> 17:30.288
That's where I want ya,
now I'm gonna beat ya.

17:30.323 --> 17:35.326
- No!

17:36.692 --> 17:37.592
- Did you have
friends besides your brother?

17:37.627 --> 17:38.791
Did anyone ever visit?

17:40.729 --> 17:42.630
- We didn't
really need anyone else.

17:45.305 --> 17:46.865
- Were you happy?

17:48.770 --> 17:51.606
- Yeah. I
mean, I guess so.

17:54.809 --> 17:57.744
I don't know if I've ever
been what I'd call happy,

17:58.714 --> 18:01.352
but I was used to that.

18:02.288 --> 18:05.224
I was comfortable as
long as Addie was, well.

18:07.393 --> 18:09.690
- Well, what, Les?

18:09.725 --> 18:13.628
- He started spending
more and more time out.

18:13.663 --> 18:15.267
- Out?
- In the night.

18:16.666 --> 18:17.665
You're somethin' else.

18:19.570 --> 18:20.734
- What? I can't celebrate?

18:20.769 --> 18:23.275
- You're always
celebrating, Addie.

18:23.310 --> 18:24.738
When are you gonna get a job?

18:24.773 --> 18:27.906
- Aren't you even gonna ask
me what I'm celebrating?

18:27.941 --> 18:29.347
- Why don't you tell me?

18:31.417 --> 18:33.714
- My sweet, bitter brother.

18:36.356 --> 18:38.158
You deserve to be
the first to know.

18:39.821 --> 18:40.655
So.

18:42.263 --> 18:44.758
Larry, you know, the
guy I've been seeing?

18:44.793 --> 18:47.662
The stockbroker with
the tight abs and-

18:47.697 --> 18:48.531
- God, Addie!

18:49.666 --> 18:51.567
- He wants me to
move in with him.

18:53.703 --> 18:54.570
- Addie, no.

18:56.002 --> 18:58.244
You barely even know the guy.

18:58.279 --> 18:59.377
- You're not the
only one who deserves

18:59.412 --> 19:00.543
to be happy, you know.

19:00.578 --> 19:02.281
- Fuck off.

19:02.316 --> 19:04.646
I never for a second
thought that I deserved

19:04.681 --> 19:08.650
anything other than to clean
up after your toxic behavior.

19:09.884 --> 19:11.752
- Oh, wow.

19:12.920 --> 19:13.886
Les.

19:15.560 --> 19:18.792
How long you been sittin'
on that nest of bullshit?

19:18.827 --> 19:21.729
- Someone has to be responsible.

19:21.764 --> 19:24.567
Pay the bills, fix the
relationships you destroy.

19:24.602 --> 19:25.997
- Yeah, I made some
money last month.

19:26.032 --> 19:27.735
Remember that old
guy who paid me to-

19:27.770 --> 19:29.242
- Oh, stop, stop!

19:29.277 --> 19:32.575
I don't want to hear that.

19:35.976 --> 19:38.944
- You're just jealous
because you can't even pay

19:38.979 --> 19:40.583
someone to touch you.

19:47.460 --> 19:49.757
- I didn't even know
that was a church song.

19:49.792 --> 19:50.989
- Yeah.

19:51.024 --> 19:52.859
Well, I guess I
should get going.

19:52.894 --> 19:56.830
But, so I was just
gonna grab some lunch.

19:57.965 --> 19:59.503
You wanna join me?

19:59.538 --> 20:00.966
- Um.

20:01.001 --> 20:04.838
Um, Noreen and I
have plans, actually.

20:05.607 --> 20:07.874
- No, no, that's
fine. No problem.

20:07.909 --> 20:12.912
I just thought, well, anyways,
see you guys next Sunday.

20:13.849 --> 20:14.485
- See you, buddy.

20:14.520 --> 20:14.947
- Bye, Roger.

20:20.790 --> 20:22.020
He's a nice guy.

20:23.826 --> 20:25.826
- Yeah, he's just a little, um.

20:26.862 --> 20:27.696
- What?

20:29.667 --> 20:30.996
- I can't quite put
my finger on it.

20:31.031 --> 20:34.307
It's just that, um, he,
yeah, he's a good guy.

20:34.342 --> 20:36.738
- No. What were
you going to say?

20:38.808 --> 20:42.480
- I, he, something about him
reminds me of my brother.

20:42.515 --> 20:44.317
- Addison?
- Yeah.

20:44.352 --> 20:45.648
- Well, when are you
gonna bring him to church

20:45.683 --> 20:46.946
so I can finally meet him?

20:48.114 --> 20:49.751
- He's not really the
church going type.

20:49.786 --> 20:52.424
- Well, you should
invite him at least.

20:52.459 --> 20:53.953
- It's, no, it's not
gonna happen like that.

20:53.988 --> 20:57.726
- Hey, the Lord works in
mysterious ways, remember?

20:57.761 --> 20:59.090
- Yeah, I know, but-

20:59.125 --> 21:01.730
- How about you just invite
him to dinner Friday night?

21:01.765 --> 21:03.963
I'm sure he's a dinner
going type, hmm?

21:06.033 --> 21:07.769
Do it for me, okay?

21:09.608 --> 21:10.706
- All right.

21:10.741 --> 21:11.575
I'll ask him.

21:19.145 --> 21:20.617
- Hey.

21:20.652 --> 21:21.915
- Hey.

21:21.950 --> 21:22.883
I thought-

21:22.918 --> 21:24.423
- That was your first mistake.

21:26.823 --> 21:30.429
Come on. Let's hit
up that weed store.

21:30.464 --> 21:32.860
- Uh, but shouldn't we?

21:44.511 --> 21:45.774
- Whoa!

21:50.946 --> 21:51.879
Ah!

21:51.914 --> 21:53.386
You gotta steer, Addie!

22:01.462 --> 22:05.563
Ow.

22:05.598 --> 22:07.862
You're a pain in the ass.

22:07.897 --> 22:10.997
- You wanted to
switch.

22:12.198 --> 22:16.574
- Oh.

22:25.079 --> 22:25.913
Hey.

22:27.851 --> 22:28.883
Noreen wants to meet you.

22:30.458 --> 22:31.688
- You sure you want that?

22:33.087 --> 22:34.757
- Why?

22:34.792 --> 22:36.154
- She may leave you for me.

22:38.059 --> 22:39.663
I don't think you're her type.

22:39.698 --> 22:40.862
- I'm just saying.

22:45.671 --> 22:46.835
- We have dinner
planned on Friday.

22:46.870 --> 22:47.704
You in?

22:51.039 --> 22:53.446
- That's you
falling off a bike.

22:56.011 --> 22:57.076
- You're an idiot.

22:59.014 --> 23:02.048
- And the time you
stepped on the coral.

23:03.689 --> 23:05.183
- I, I still have a piece
of it lodged in my foot.

23:05.218 --> 23:07.856
- No way.
- Yeah.

23:07.891 --> 23:10.056
- That was how many years ago?

23:10.091 --> 23:11.827
- I thought it would've
come out by now

23:11.862 --> 23:15.226
or dissolved or
something,

23:15.261 --> 23:17.195
but it's still there
and now it just hurts

23:17.230 --> 23:21.936
when it rains, and it smells
funny sometimes.

23:21.971 --> 23:22.838
- Gross.

23:22.873 --> 23:23.740
- Excuse me.

23:24.842 --> 23:26.941
I'm gonna go to the restroom.

23:35.083 --> 23:36.588
- I think she really likes me.

23:37.888 --> 23:39.888
- Yeah, I don't know, bro.

23:39.923 --> 23:41.219
I don't think she's your type.

23:42.761 --> 23:43.958
- Really?

23:43.993 --> 23:46.631
And what exactly is my type?

23:46.666 --> 23:48.930
- Well, someone
with a sense of humor

23:48.965 --> 23:49.799
for starters.

23:51.066 --> 23:52.934
- Give her a chance.
She just met you.

23:54.300 --> 23:56.234
She, she's nice, really.

23:57.644 --> 23:59.204
- Eh, I don't think
she's that in to you.

24:00.207 --> 24:02.075
- Why do you always do this?

24:02.110 --> 24:03.043
- Do what?

24:03.078 --> 24:04.616
- This.

24:04.651 --> 24:05.584
Every time I have something
good going for me,

24:05.619 --> 24:07.245
you just shoot it down.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.081
- No way.

24:09.183 --> 24:10.952
Bro, I'm just
looking out for you.

24:12.593 --> 24:13.757
Come on, let's get outta here.

24:13.792 --> 24:15.561
You're not the only one
with a date tonight.

24:15.596 --> 24:16.991
- I'm gonna wait for Noreen.

24:19.226 --> 24:21.226
- Dude, I don't think
she's comin' back.

25:00.608 --> 25:01.640
- What?

25:01.675 --> 25:02.641
- Really?

25:02.676 --> 25:03.576
Roger?

25:03.611 --> 25:05.006
- Damn, I told him to hurry.

25:06.141 --> 25:08.009
- Yes, Roger.

25:08.044 --> 25:10.143
He's a damn sight
friendlier than Noreen.

25:10.178 --> 25:11.848
- You're doing this
just to spite me.

25:11.883 --> 25:13.883
- You're so uptight.

25:15.084 --> 25:16.182
Hey, maybe she's
perfect for you.

25:16.217 --> 25:18.349
- I'm responsible,
Addison. Unlike you.

25:18.384 --> 25:20.285
- Shut up.

25:20.320 --> 25:21.957
Ever since you started
going to that church,

25:21.992 --> 25:23.695
you're Dad all over again.

25:23.730 --> 25:24.762
- Well, maybe it would
do you good to join me

25:24.797 --> 25:26.027
every once in a while.

25:26.062 --> 25:26.995
They're good people.

25:27.030 --> 25:28.733
Maybe they can help you.

25:28.768 --> 25:30.031
- You mean like Roger?

25:30.066 --> 25:30.966
- No, Addie.

25:31.001 --> 25:33.870
Look, just, this needs to stop.

25:33.905 --> 25:37.170
- What? What needs to stop?

25:37.205 --> 25:38.743
Do you know what we do?

25:40.373 --> 25:41.680
You want me to describe it?

25:41.715 --> 25:42.648
- No.

25:42.683 --> 25:44.210
- Maybe you wanna join.

25:44.245 --> 25:45.277
Wow.

25:45.312 --> 25:46.344
Little Les, you're really sick.

25:46.379 --> 25:48.049
- No, stop!

25:48.084 --> 25:51.019
Addison, this, this, this,
this promiscuity thing.

25:51.054 --> 25:52.724
You can't just sleep-

25:52.759 --> 25:54.319
- Ah, so I guess it's okay
for you to have Noreen,

25:54.354 --> 25:56.321
but I'm supposed to what?

25:56.356 --> 25:57.190
Be alone?

25:59.095 --> 26:00.732
Just keep me inside, little Les.

26:00.767 --> 26:02.162
Is that what you want?

26:02.197 --> 26:03.361
Well, I'm not Mom.

26:03.396 --> 26:05.066
You don't get to
just lock me up.

26:07.004 --> 26:08.300
And I thought you weren't Dad.

26:09.270 --> 26:12.238
Sweet, quiet, little Les.

26:14.209 --> 26:15.043
How dare you?

26:17.377 --> 26:19.212
You know, you're an
even bigger faggot

26:19.247 --> 26:21.115
than I could ever try to be.

26:21.917 --> 26:24.085
All that wood shoved
so far up your ass.

26:24.120 --> 26:26.186
Can you taste it, little Les?

26:26.221 --> 26:27.121
- Addie.

26:27.156 --> 26:28.155
- Can you, little sissy boy?

26:29.730 --> 26:31.763
Don't want to hurt your
precious little morals, right?

26:31.798 --> 26:32.698
Just like Dad?

26:34.801 --> 26:35.899
But I'm too different.

26:36.770 --> 26:37.670
Right, Les?

26:37.705 --> 26:39.067
- Addie, you know what I meant.

26:39.102 --> 26:44.105
- You're right. I did.

26:46.241 --> 26:47.306
- Addie, don't.

26:51.884 --> 26:53.048
Addie, please.

27:00.057 --> 27:02.728
- Lester, you're not
gonna feel better

27:02.763 --> 27:04.158
if you don't take your medicine.

27:07.262 --> 27:08.261
Come on.

27:27.282 --> 27:28.314
- Where's Addison?

27:32.793 --> 27:35.288
- What was life
like without Addison for you?

27:40.262 --> 27:41.965
- I was miserable.

27:44.937 --> 27:45.771
I mean,

27:48.171 --> 27:49.808
we still had that psychic bond.

27:50.877 --> 27:52.503
I could still sense him.

27:52.538 --> 27:54.274
Moods and stuff like that.

27:55.816 --> 27:59.477
But I, I couldn't
make out his thoughts.

27:59.512 --> 28:02.117
They were muddy.

28:02.152 --> 28:05.153
Like he, he was hiding them.

28:08.389 --> 28:11.027
- Did you have
other companions then?

28:11.062 --> 28:12.259
Friends?

28:12.294 --> 28:13.359
Anyone you could turn to?

28:14.967 --> 28:18.738
- I did go on a couple
of dates with Allison,

28:19.972 --> 28:21.499
a girl from work.

28:21.534 --> 28:24.337
- I'm glad you called.

28:24.372 --> 28:25.404
- Yeah, me too.

28:26.572 --> 28:28.539
I didn't know if...

28:28.574 --> 28:31.476
- I know it was a little
presumptuous of me, wasn't it?

28:32.853 --> 28:34.248
- No, no. That's
not what I meant.

28:37.253 --> 28:40.386
Thank you for, for
giving me your number.

28:41.355 --> 28:43.356
I would've been too
embarrassed to ask for it.

28:43.391 --> 28:45.831
- Oh.

28:45.866 --> 28:49.131
I hope you don't think I go
around doing that all the time.

28:49.166 --> 28:51.232
That was the first.

28:51.267 --> 28:53.938
- No, I don't think that at all.

28:57.009 --> 29:00.373
- You had the perfect
combination of
honest and oblivious,

29:00.408 --> 29:02.210
so I thought, why not?

29:03.180 --> 29:05.818
- What?

29:05.853 --> 29:08.018
- I watched you ignore
every other table

29:08.053 --> 29:09.217
for an entire night.

29:09.252 --> 29:10.350
Did you even get any tips?

29:12.618 --> 29:14.486
- I got your phone number.

29:14.521 --> 29:15.355
- Mmm-hmm.

29:17.964 --> 29:19.997
- You didn't even give me a tip.

29:20.032 --> 29:22.197
I made like 75 cents that night.

29:22.232 --> 29:23.968
- Someone had to
let you know why.

29:28.271 --> 29:29.908
- Is this okay?

29:29.943 --> 29:30.568
- Yes.

29:34.013 --> 29:35.078
- This is tuna.

29:36.213 --> 29:39.280
- It could be paper
or rocks or air.

29:39.315 --> 29:40.853
Thanks for not starving me.

29:42.384 --> 29:44.384
- Yeah.

29:44.419 --> 29:47.321
I don't really do this much.

29:49.160 --> 29:50.390
- Eat lunch?

29:50.425 --> 29:51.257
- Dinner or die.

29:51.293 --> 29:54.361
That's what I always
say.

29:55.397 --> 29:58.167
No, go on dates. This.

29:58.202 --> 29:59.498
- Oh, that's all right.

29:59.533 --> 30:00.939
I'm not expecting anything.

30:00.974 --> 30:01.973
I would like to, you know-

30:02.008 --> 30:03.601
- No, yeah. It's fine.

30:30.333 --> 30:31.365
- Ah.

30:32.500 --> 30:33.334
Oh.

30:34.337 --> 30:36.370
I'm so sorry!

30:36.405 --> 30:38.438
- I couldn't give
her what she wanted.

30:42.048 --> 30:43.245
I missed him so much.

30:43.280 --> 30:45.412
I, I just couldn't
do it anymore.

30:46.712 --> 30:49.482
I couldn't be without him.

30:49.517 --> 30:52.485
How can you just stop having
someone in your life like that?

30:53.321 --> 30:56.423
He was there for every
breath, and suddenly-

30:56.458 --> 30:57.556
- Minus six minutes.

30:58.427 --> 30:59.624
- What?

30:59.659 --> 31:01.593
- Every breath
minus six minutes.

31:10.472 --> 31:13.209
- So, I went to find him.

31:19.481 --> 31:21.613
It wasn't hard. I
could still sense him.

32:09.465 --> 32:10.299
Addie?

32:17.506 --> 32:18.340
Addie?

32:26.449 --> 32:28.350
- Boo!
- Geez!

32:31.289 --> 32:33.025
- Oh, there, brother.

32:39.429 --> 32:41.726
- I knew you were here.

32:41.761 --> 32:44.102
- Well, you did find me, freak.

32:44.137 --> 32:45.466
How'd you know where I was?

32:47.536 --> 32:48.667
Oh!

32:48.702 --> 32:51.472
Oh, bro!

32:51.507 --> 32:52.572
I can't feel my legs.

32:59.482 --> 33:00.217
- I missed you.

33:03.288 --> 33:04.122
Oh, okay.

33:04.157 --> 33:05.750
People are gonna stare.

33:05.785 --> 33:08.159
- Girl, people started
staring when you attacked me.

33:08.194 --> 33:10.161
- Oh!

33:10.196 --> 33:11.327
Well-
- This is Portland.

33:11.362 --> 33:13.065
At the very least,
they don't give a shit.

33:14.530 --> 33:16.629
If anything, they'll pick at
us for not being out enough.

33:16.664 --> 33:19.302
Hey!

33:22.637 --> 33:24.208
What brought you into town?

33:27.345 --> 33:28.806
- I wanted to surprise you.

33:35.617 --> 33:37.485
- Still doing that church stuff?

33:39.258 --> 33:41.654
- Yeah. I still go, but.

33:41.689 --> 33:42.523
- But?

33:47.827 --> 33:51.664
Addie, I never, I never wanted
you to be any different.

33:57.408 --> 33:59.441
- What about?
- Roger?

33:59.476 --> 34:00.508
- What's her name?

34:00.543 --> 34:03.610
- Oh, Noreen.

34:03.645 --> 34:04.479
It was awkward.

34:05.383 --> 34:06.184
- Told you.

34:07.086 --> 34:10.452
- But I did start
seeing someone, though.

34:11.521 --> 34:12.751
This girl named Allison.

34:15.459 --> 34:16.689
She was...

34:24.765 --> 34:27.667
She's, she's,
she's pretty great.

34:27.702 --> 34:29.537
- That a boy.

34:29.572 --> 34:30.571
- Now, hold on.

34:30.606 --> 34:31.505
Don't get carried away.

34:31.541 --> 34:33.772
I'm not gonna like,
you know, be like you.

34:35.314 --> 34:36.676
- You wound me, bro.

34:38.746 --> 34:39.712
I've changed my ways.

34:39.747 --> 34:40.746
I date responsibly now.

34:40.781 --> 34:41.615
You'll see.

34:43.685 --> 34:45.289
- You still dating?

34:45.324 --> 34:46.587
- People?

34:46.622 --> 34:47.654
- Yes.

34:48.822 --> 34:50.690
- A leopard doesn't
change his spots.

34:52.760 --> 34:55.365
- In this analogy, are
you wearing leopard print?

34:56.236 --> 34:58.665
- Yes, and it's fabulous.

34:58.700 --> 35:00.469
- Well, that's up for debate.

35:00.504 --> 35:01.338
- Les.

35:03.870 --> 35:04.704
- Sorry.

35:07.709 --> 35:08.873
- I love you.

35:08.908 --> 35:11.678
Just be my brother.

35:14.914 --> 35:15.748
Come on.

35:17.257 --> 35:18.685
- Where are we going?

35:18.720 --> 35:20.786
- This is the land
of lust, sugar bear.

35:20.821 --> 35:23.459
Whatever you desire,
we'll go out and get it.

35:24.128 --> 35:25.659
- Can we just go to your place?

35:26.761 --> 35:27.628
- What place?

35:31.964 --> 35:33.898
- No, don't. Ah!

35:38.773 --> 35:40.476
- I want to move
on to the incident

35:40.511 --> 35:42.379
in which you sustained
your injuries.

35:46.715 --> 35:47.549
- I...

35:48.816 --> 35:50.783
I was handcuffed.

35:50.818 --> 35:51.884
- Before that.

35:51.919 --> 35:54.754
Before you were brought
here, you were already hurt.

35:54.789 --> 35:55.788
How did that happen?

36:01.466 --> 36:02.861
Les, this is important.

36:05.800 --> 36:06.634
- Why?

36:10.805 --> 36:13.773
- Okay, I'm gonna take
a short bathroom break.

36:13.808 --> 36:15.544
You need anything? Water? Food?

36:18.615 --> 36:19.449
Okay.

36:35.632 --> 36:36.466
- Addison.

36:41.737 --> 36:43.000
Addison.

36:57.016 --> 36:58.356
- I know it was tough for you.

36:58.391 --> 36:59.852
- It's okay.

36:59.887 --> 37:00.653
I guess I deserved it.

37:00.688 --> 37:02.822
- Oh, you definitely
deserved it.

37:02.857 --> 37:04.054
- Hey.

37:04.089 --> 37:05.055
- I think it did you some good.

37:05.090 --> 37:06.760
- Ugh! Why?

37:08.093 --> 37:10.027
- You dated that
new chick Allison.

37:11.668 --> 37:14.031
When I'm around, you never
spend time with anyone else.

37:14.066 --> 37:15.505
Except those church
people, I guess,

37:15.540 --> 37:17.034
but they just made
you a psychopath.

37:17.069 --> 37:18.904
- Oh, come on. They
weren't that bad.

37:20.578 --> 37:21.644
- You know they were never
going to accept me, right?

37:21.679 --> 37:23.975
- But if they cared about
me, they'd get to know you.

37:24.010 --> 37:25.515
- Les, you know I'm right.

37:28.916 --> 37:30.751
If they can't love their
brother as they love themselves,

37:30.786 --> 37:32.423
then I don't want
any part of it.

37:33.657 --> 37:35.558
- You never gave
them the chance.

37:43.095 --> 37:44.831
- I still think
about Roger, though.

37:46.868 --> 37:47.768
He was a good man.

37:57.813 --> 37:59.516
- Les, you all right?

38:00.145 --> 38:00.946
- Addison.

38:03.918 --> 38:05.357
Where's Addison?

38:05.392 --> 38:06.952
- Don't worry about
that right now.

38:06.987 --> 38:08.756
We'll address that when
you're fully recovered.

38:08.791 --> 38:12.496
- I can't recover if I
don't know Addie's okay.

38:14.698 --> 38:16.401
Why can't I remember?

38:16.436 --> 38:18.832
- Les, you've suffered
a cranial injury,

38:18.867 --> 38:21.835
as well as what I believe is
a serious emotional trauma.

38:23.038 --> 38:27.478
Either incident alone is enough
to create an amnesiac event.

38:28.778 --> 38:30.877
And both of them together,

38:30.912 --> 38:33.847
I'm not at all surprised
by your memory lapses.

38:34.883 --> 38:36.850
Now, it's important that we
take our time walking back

38:36.885 --> 38:39.490
through what
memories you do have

38:39.525 --> 38:41.052
in order to find
out where this few,

38:41.087 --> 38:43.461
this memory lapse begins.

38:43.496 --> 38:44.396
Do you understand?

38:45.795 --> 38:47.762
- But why can't I feel Addison?

38:48.930 --> 38:52.602
My whole life I've
been able.

38:59.776 --> 39:02.678
- I'm bound by the law and
the oaths of my profession

39:02.713 --> 39:05.648
to stick with the
existing science on this.

39:05.683 --> 39:10.686
No extra sensory bond
or what have you.

39:11.986 --> 39:12.820
As a part of my
training, you understand?

39:14.692 --> 39:16.824
That said, I will give you

39:16.859 --> 39:20.663
that this bond that
you've described

39:20.698 --> 39:23.996
between you and Addison seems
to have been interrupted

39:24.031 --> 39:25.767
by the trauma you experienced.

39:28.871 --> 39:31.509
- If I recover, will
I hear him again?

39:31.544 --> 39:32.807
- I don't know. I'm sorry.

39:32.842 --> 39:33.641
- I need to find him.

39:33.676 --> 39:34.974
- Well, maybe we
should talk about

39:35.009 --> 39:35.975
the last time you saw him.

39:37.176 --> 39:39.517
Maybe that'll give
us some answers.

39:43.490 --> 39:45.919
Let's talk about your
visit with your mother.

39:47.527 --> 39:48.152
Les.

39:50.992 --> 39:54.466
- My mom lives a ways away.

39:55.634 --> 39:56.501
A couple hours.

39:57.603 --> 39:59.537
- How did you get to her house?

40:02.740 --> 40:03.904
Les, what's the matter?

40:03.939 --> 40:05.675
- Why do you keep
bringing up my mother?

40:05.710 --> 40:06.775
I haven't said
anything about her.

40:06.810 --> 40:08.513
I just wanna see my brother.

40:08.548 --> 40:11.043
- Well, Les, I believe the
information about your mother

40:11.078 --> 40:12.946
is critical to our
work here today.

40:12.981 --> 40:14.816
- Don't you think it's kind
of weird that you keep asking

40:14.851 --> 40:15.982
about her when I
haven't said anything

40:16.017 --> 40:18.017
that makes her relevant
to my situation?

40:19.218 --> 40:20.987
- Is there
a problem here, Les?

40:21.022 --> 40:22.593
- Yeah, you're god damn
right there's a problem.

40:22.628 --> 40:24.188
I don't think you're
a good doctor.

40:25.697 --> 40:26.927
I want another one.

40:26.962 --> 40:27.761
You're not trying
to help me at all.

40:27.796 --> 40:28.929
- Les, please stay
and talk to me.

40:28.964 --> 40:29.831
- I can't!

40:30.867 --> 40:33.098
You keep trying to find
out stuff about my mother,

40:33.133 --> 40:35.265
and I just want my brother back.

40:35.300 --> 40:36.706
It's unrelated.

40:36.741 --> 40:38.136
Why are you being such
a god damn weirdo?

40:43.077 --> 40:48.047
- Les, are you okay?

40:57.828 --> 41:00.026
- Why am I like this?

41:01.700 --> 41:03.161
- I don't know, Les.

41:05.066 --> 41:07.033
Why don't we try
and find out, okay?

41:11.941 --> 41:13.006
There you go.

41:21.148 --> 41:22.279
It's okay, buddy.

41:34.359 --> 41:37.635
- Addie came to
pick me up from work.

41:37.670 --> 41:39.670
- She feels abandoned, Les.

41:41.168 --> 41:43.773
She told me on the phone
to save the photo albums

41:43.808 --> 41:45.269
before they get
rid of everything.

41:46.976 --> 41:47.777
- They?

41:48.681 --> 41:50.076
Who's they?

41:50.111 --> 41:52.177
People she thinks are
gonna throw her shit away

41:52.212 --> 41:53.145
when she dies.

41:54.654 --> 41:56.687
She's planning her death, Les.

41:56.722 --> 41:57.919
She doesn't even
think we'll be there

41:57.954 --> 41:59.657
to take care of
her after the fact.

42:01.056 --> 42:02.352
- Addie, that's nuts.

42:02.387 --> 42:04.728
- Maybe, but it
makes sense to her.

42:07.062 --> 42:08.930
When's the last
time you saw her?

42:13.200 --> 42:14.837
- Last time you did.

42:14.872 --> 42:15.937
Christmas.

42:15.972 --> 42:17.708
- Yeah, Christmas 'O8.

42:19.074 --> 42:20.810
She thinks she's
seen the last of us.

42:20.845 --> 42:22.713
Les, that's my point.

42:22.748 --> 42:24.913
- We can't just go down
there and take care of her.

42:24.948 --> 42:26.046
I've got a job. You got-

42:26.081 --> 42:28.048
- We can. Les, we can.

42:28.083 --> 42:29.720
I already talked
to her about it.

42:33.220 --> 42:36.353
- We'll hire her a maid,
someone to attend the garden,

42:36.388 --> 42:37.827
herd the cats.

42:37.862 --> 42:39.059
- So she can fire
them a week later

42:39.094 --> 42:41.061
like she did when she
got out of the hospital?

42:41.096 --> 42:42.832
- She was healthier then.

42:42.867 --> 42:44.702
She, she needs the
assistance now.

42:44.737 --> 42:45.736
- The cats are gone.

42:46.772 --> 42:48.200
- What?

42:48.235 --> 42:49.069
Since when?

42:50.435 --> 42:52.237
- Two of them died.

42:52.272 --> 42:54.041
One of them ran
away 'cause she left

42:54.076 --> 42:56.274
the door open all night.

42:56.309 --> 42:57.781
That's not the point.

42:57.816 --> 42:59.948
The point is she still
doesn't want the help.

43:03.690 --> 43:04.656
She's dying.

43:04.691 --> 43:07.153
- She'll outlive us both.

43:07.188 --> 43:09.155
She just complains
to get us down there.

43:09.190 --> 43:12.158
- She complains because
she wants it to end.

43:12.193 --> 43:16.195
- Well, she doesn't really
have the option at this point.

43:16.230 --> 43:17.702
- She does.
- Addie.

43:18.364 --> 43:19.902
Stop talking like that.

43:19.937 --> 43:22.069
- It's what she wants.

43:22.104 --> 43:23.235
I already talked to her
about it, I told you.

43:23.270 --> 43:25.138
- Well, we can't always
get what we want.

43:29.111 --> 43:30.210
Addie, look.

43:30.246 --> 43:33.146
I really, really don't want
to talk about this at work.

43:35.986 --> 43:36.820
- You're right.

43:39.352 --> 43:40.186
Let's go see her.

43:47.228 --> 43:48.260
- Addie.

43:59.812 --> 44:01.207
Addie, can you
please talk to me?

44:16.994 --> 44:19.456
If we could, if we could just
move her into a facility.

44:19.491 --> 44:20.325
- No!

44:22.527 --> 44:25.165
We're not going
to warehouse her.

44:25.200 --> 44:26.232
- Addie, it's not-
- She'd rather be dead.

44:26.267 --> 44:27.464
- It's not like that anymore.

44:27.499 --> 44:30.269
They have this, this
whole graduated care-

44:30.304 --> 44:31.908
- Drop it, Les.

44:33.307 --> 44:34.108
I'm warning you.

44:37.344 --> 44:38.178
- Or what?

44:43.350 --> 44:44.316
Or what, Addie?

44:47.959 --> 44:52.962
- You know what.

45:08.309 --> 45:11.046
- We can talk her out of it.

45:11.081 --> 45:12.080
Give her options.

45:18.253 --> 45:19.285
She'll see reason.

45:23.126 --> 45:24.455
She's not crazy.
- Exactly.

45:26.228 --> 45:27.062
- What?

45:28.395 --> 45:29.328
- Do you wanna
know what she said

45:29.363 --> 45:31.297
when we talked on the phone?

45:33.004 --> 45:34.003
- Yeah.

45:34.039 --> 45:36.335
- She told me she couldn't
bear to be a burden.

45:39.010 --> 45:40.372
She said she couldn't
stand the thought

45:40.407 --> 45:44.343
of forcing herself
on her little Les.

45:44.378 --> 45:46.411
Even if it just meant
that you'd be stuck

45:46.446 --> 45:48.380
with the responsibility
of her estate.

45:51.022 --> 45:54.023
I told her I'd help, but she
said Les wouldn't let you.

45:55.026 --> 45:56.322
It's too important to him.

45:59.294 --> 46:00.458
Don't you get it, Les?

46:03.364 --> 46:05.067
She refuses to bury you,

46:08.468 --> 46:11.370
which is exactly what will
happen if we drag this out.

46:12.139 --> 46:14.241
She's protecting
you from yourself.

46:17.609 --> 46:20.082
Because you're too good for her.

46:22.185 --> 46:23.349
For this family, maybe.

46:28.521 --> 46:30.323
- I'm not gonna kill Mom.

46:30.358 --> 46:32.160
- Then I'll do it.

46:32.195 --> 46:33.425
Fuck, man!

46:34.361 --> 46:36.230
It's better than whatever
she'd tried to do

46:36.265 --> 46:37.462
to get it done herself.

46:39.070 --> 46:43.600
I know it sounds awful,
but I promise you.

46:45.340 --> 46:47.505
The last time we
talked on the phone,

46:47.540 --> 46:49.573
you don't remember the
last time you've heard Mom

46:49.608 --> 46:53.313
sound so peaceful and lucid.

46:55.218 --> 46:56.019
I swear to God.

47:03.424 --> 47:06.260
- I think I'm gonna throw up.

47:06.295 --> 47:07.360
- Damn it, Les.

47:46.566 --> 47:48.368
- Hi, Mom.

47:48.403 --> 47:51.074
- Oh, good. You
brought everyone.

47:51.109 --> 47:51.943
- Yeah, well.

47:53.111 --> 47:55.177
Addison thought we
should just drop by.

47:55.212 --> 47:56.013
- Narc.

47:56.708 --> 47:58.378
- What?

47:58.413 --> 48:01.711
- I said Les should go to
the park, like the dog park,

48:01.746 --> 48:03.284
'cause he's a little bitch.

48:04.485 --> 48:06.056
- That doesn't make any sense.

48:06.091 --> 48:07.090
- I agree.

48:07.125 --> 48:08.355
- Hi, sweetie.

48:08.390 --> 48:10.621
- Hi, Mama.
- Hi, baby.

48:10.656 --> 48:12.997
Oh, come on, sit.

48:13.032 --> 48:14.526
You sit, sit, sit.

48:17.366 --> 48:20.037
So you here for the party
or are you gonna watch?

48:20.072 --> 48:22.039
Wait, I'm, let me get
you something to drink.

48:22.074 --> 48:24.668
I got water. I got milk.

48:24.703 --> 48:26.142
- You got any more
of that moonshine?

48:26.177 --> 48:29.607
- Ha-ha-ha,
Addison. Don't say that.

48:29.642 --> 48:32.445
Come on, you know that
my friend was here

48:32.480 --> 48:34.282
and we finished it.

48:40.191 --> 48:42.620
Yeah, well, the
water's still shit, so.

48:44.459 --> 48:45.258
Yeah.

48:45.293 --> 48:49.132
And yes, I do have
a friend, Susan.

48:50.465 --> 48:51.266
Oh!

48:51.301 --> 48:52.531
- Mom! Mom! Mom!

48:52.566 --> 48:53.664
- Oh! Ow!

48:53.699 --> 48:55.105
- Are you okay?

48:55.140 --> 48:56.205
- Ow! Yes!
- Is it your back?

48:56.240 --> 48:59.010
- No, I, my stomach's
pinching me.

48:59.045 --> 49:01.078
- Oh, um. Here, let's go sit.

49:01.113 --> 49:02.112
- Okay.

49:02.147 --> 49:03.344
- Can I help you, Mom?

49:03.379 --> 49:08.382
- Oh, there's my boy!

49:08.780 --> 49:10.219
Oh, gosh.

49:10.254 --> 49:13.255
I was wondering if you
were gonna be coming.

49:13.290 --> 49:16.522
You know, Les doesn't
tell me anything.

49:17.459 --> 49:19.327
Okay. Okay.

49:19.362 --> 49:20.427
- You ready for your party?

49:20.462 --> 49:22.297
- Yes! Party!

49:22.332 --> 49:24.365
- Wait, what, what party?

49:24.400 --> 49:26.796
- My son is throwing
me a going away party

49:26.831 --> 49:28.732
and you're ruining it.

49:28.767 --> 49:31.306
Please just sit down,
Les, and have fun.

49:37.479 --> 49:38.643
- Oh, oh.

49:38.678 --> 49:40.183
- What did the doctor say?

49:42.286 --> 49:44.286
- What?

49:44.321 --> 49:45.155
- The doctor.

49:45.190 --> 49:47.553
- What doctor?

49:47.588 --> 49:48.653
- Your doctor, Mom.

49:48.688 --> 49:50.754
- Oh, I fired him.

49:50.789 --> 49:52.195
- What?

49:52.230 --> 49:54.428
- He's always trying
to do stuff to me.

49:54.463 --> 49:56.397
- Mom, you can't
fire your doctor.

49:57.796 --> 50:01.171
What, what do you mean do stuff?

50:01.206 --> 50:03.239
- I, he's doing weird things.

50:03.274 --> 50:04.504
I'm not going back there.

50:05.639 --> 50:07.078
Mmm-mmm. That's it.

50:08.213 --> 50:11.082
Oh my god, I can't
trust anybody.

50:11.117 --> 50:12.743
Just can't even trust anybody.

50:12.778 --> 50:14.382
No, I'm not seeing the doc.

50:16.617 --> 50:18.386
I want music.

50:18.421 --> 50:19.651
- I got it.

50:19.686 --> 50:22.225
- Music, music, music,
music, music, music.

50:25.890 --> 50:27.560
You are such a good boy, Addie.

50:29.366 --> 50:31.597
Thank you for taking such
good care of your mama.

50:35.339 --> 50:36.767
Good dancer.

50:36.802 --> 50:37.867
- Milk's bad, Mom.

50:37.902 --> 50:40.870
- Good. It's fine for me.

50:40.905 --> 50:42.212
- Yeah, Les, it's fine.

50:42.247 --> 50:44.181
It's just closer to cheese.

50:45.415 --> 50:46.216
- Cheese!

50:53.456 --> 50:54.818
- Why are you doing this to Mom?

50:56.393 --> 50:57.359
- She needs to get better.

50:57.394 --> 50:59.559
- You don't have the right.

50:59.594 --> 51:01.528
- If, if she just
talks to a doctor, then-

51:01.563 --> 51:03.134
- Fuck the doctor!

51:05.336 --> 51:06.368
You don't understand.

51:07.701 --> 51:09.305
She can't leave the house.

51:10.704 --> 51:12.374
She doesn't sleep.

51:12.409 --> 51:14.739
She can't wash her hair
because of her arthritis.

51:14.774 --> 51:16.576
The meds constipate
her so bad that-

51:16.611 --> 51:19.678
- I get it, Addie.
- No, you don't get it!

51:19.713 --> 51:20.811
You don't get it

51:22.749 --> 51:24.749
because you're so
preoccupied with how

51:24.784 --> 51:27.356
everyone else affects
you that you don't see

51:27.391 --> 51:28.357
how much pain they're in.

51:28.392 --> 51:30.887
This isn't about you, Les.

51:30.922 --> 51:32.427
This is about Mom.

51:33.628 --> 51:34.924
And this is probably the
first thing she's had

51:34.959 --> 51:36.695
to look forward
to since Dad died.

51:39.601 --> 51:40.633
Go out there.

51:43.836 --> 51:46.441
Go out there and look at her.

51:51.547 --> 51:52.843
I swear to God, Les.

51:52.878 --> 51:54.548
If you don't go out there
and look at that woman,

51:55.914 --> 51:58.255
who is happier than
you have ever seen her,

51:59.984 --> 52:03.590
because she's looking
forward to this one thing,

52:04.593 --> 52:05.790
you're next on the list.

52:08.828 --> 52:10.366
- I'm not killing Mom,

52:12.304 --> 52:13.303
and neither are you.

53:07.359 --> 53:09.458
- Father used to love it.

53:10.824 --> 53:11.856
- Mom.

53:12.859 --> 53:15.464
Why did Dad hate Addie so much?

53:16.533 --> 53:18.269
- He didn't hate him.

53:19.238 --> 53:22.735
John just didn't, he
didn't like new ideas.

53:24.640 --> 53:27.674
There was something in
you that your father

53:27.709 --> 53:30.710
just couldn't reconcile.

53:30.745 --> 53:33.042
And he was a good man.

53:33.077 --> 53:34.780
You're a good man.

53:35.684 --> 53:37.717
- It's time, Mom.

53:39.050 --> 53:39.884
- Oh.

53:41.756 --> 53:46.759
I love you forever.
- Oh.

53:53.768 --> 53:58.771
I love you, Mama.

54:01.875 --> 54:03.479
Addie, wait.

54:03.514 --> 54:04.645
- Go to bed, Les.

54:04.680 --> 54:05.514
- Addison.

54:06.814 --> 54:10.981
- Go to your room and go to bed.

55:20.987 --> 55:23.823
- And
then what happened?

55:28.467 --> 55:29.367
- I waited.

55:30.997 --> 55:33.162
- Waited for what?

55:35.837 --> 55:36.902
- I can't remember.

55:44.912 --> 55:47.880
- Les, you know you're
going to stand trial, right?

55:48.849 --> 55:51.488
You're currently in the
custody of the state.

55:52.953 --> 55:53.985
You are,

55:55.890 --> 55:59.023
you are the only suspect
in a very serious crime,

56:00.059 --> 56:03.434
and it's my job to determine
your level of competence.

56:04.734 --> 56:06.602
You won't stand trial, however,

56:06.637 --> 56:10.001
if you're incapable
of participating in
your own defense.

56:11.037 --> 56:11.970
You understand me, Les?

56:14.007 --> 56:14.874
- What crime?

56:16.108 --> 56:18.009
- They want to charge
you with murder.

56:19.683 --> 56:22.046
Now, for obvious reasons,
I can't talk to you about

56:22.081 --> 56:23.685
the details of the event.

56:24.688 --> 56:27.920
And should you confess to
me, it will affect your case.

56:29.121 --> 56:31.627
- I, I didn't murder.

56:33.092 --> 56:33.926
I saved.

56:35.996 --> 56:37.633
- Les, we have
reason to believe.

56:37.668 --> 56:38.502
- Oh my god.

56:41.771 --> 56:46.543
Oh my god.

56:50.582 --> 56:55.585
I killed Addison.

57:13.902 --> 57:15.902
- What is your
area of expertise?

57:17.543 --> 57:19.004
- I specialize in
mood disorders,

57:19.039 --> 57:21.974
schizophrenia and
dissociative behavior.

57:22.743 --> 57:25.747
- Let's say just for a
moment that the patient

57:25.782 --> 57:28.145
was in fact suicidal.

57:28.180 --> 57:29.784
Would that, in your opinion,

57:29.819 --> 57:32.149
render him incapable
of understanding

57:32.184 --> 57:35.592
the charges against him or
participating his own defense?

57:35.627 --> 57:37.924
- Um, not necessarily, no.

57:39.092 --> 57:41.092
- In your opinion, what
would render someone

57:41.127 --> 57:43.127
incapable of participating
in their own self-defense?

57:43.162 --> 57:45.063
- A person who was delusional.

57:45.098 --> 57:48.099
Dissociative, for example,
would not understand

57:48.134 --> 57:50.706
the consequences of
their actions, so.

57:50.741 --> 57:51.971
- In your professional opinion,

57:52.006 --> 57:54.776
and after hours of
evaluating Mr. McCubbin,

57:54.811 --> 57:58.846
do you believe he possesses
one or more of these behaviors?

58:00.047 --> 58:02.619
- Mr. McCubbin is interesting.

58:02.654 --> 58:04.720
He doesn't seem
to be irrational,

58:04.755 --> 58:09.252
and yet his behavior is
that of a dissociative

58:09.287 --> 58:11.122
or delusional person.

58:11.157 --> 58:12.123
So, yes.

58:14.765 --> 58:16.061
- Thank you.

58:16.096 --> 58:17.832
No more questions, Your Honor.

58:17.867 --> 58:19.262
- Redirect, Ms. Jones?

58:19.297 --> 58:20.197
- Yes, Your Honor.

58:22.839 --> 58:24.839
Dr. Hunter, how long
have you been working-

58:24.874 --> 58:27.611
- What the hell is going on?
- Shh!

58:27.646 --> 58:29.613
- What the hell is going on?

58:29.648 --> 58:31.208
- Les, I know it's
hard to listen to,

58:31.243 --> 58:32.814
but just bear with it.

58:32.849 --> 58:33.848
We're gonna get through this.

58:33.883 --> 58:34.684
- Why am I here?

58:36.347 --> 58:38.886
- We need to convince
everyone in this room

58:38.921 --> 58:41.218
that you are not responsible
for your own actions.

58:42.958 --> 58:43.825
Do you understand?

58:43.860 --> 58:45.057
- No, I don't-

58:45.092 --> 58:46.795
- Mr. Frazer, keep
your client in line

58:46.830 --> 58:48.093
or he'll be held in contempt.

58:48.128 --> 58:49.028
- Yes, Your Honor.

58:51.065 --> 58:52.196
Just trust me.

58:52.865 --> 58:54.605
It's the only way out for you.

58:57.137 --> 58:59.643
He was asking for the
whereabouts of someone

58:59.678 --> 59:00.941
he called Addison.

59:02.241 --> 59:03.339
- Who is Addison?

59:04.375 --> 59:05.847
- According to Mr. McCubbin,

59:05.882 --> 59:08.047
he's his fraternal twin brother.

59:11.217 --> 59:14.350
- Ms. Sanchez, in the
course of your EMT duties

59:14.385 --> 59:16.121
on the evening of April 9th,

59:16.156 --> 59:18.090
you were called to the home

59:18.125 --> 59:21.027
of 10036 De Lanci
Court in Marston.

59:21.062 --> 59:23.128
Was the emergency that you
responded to at this address

59:23.163 --> 59:26.197
classified as a
psychiatric emergency?

59:26.232 --> 59:27.671
- No.

59:27.706 --> 59:28.331
- What was the
call you responded to

59:28.366 --> 59:30.201
at De Lanci Court?

59:30.236 --> 59:32.236
- A homicide and a
critical wounded.

59:33.239 --> 59:36.207
- Ms. Sanchez, besides
yourself and your partner,

59:36.242 --> 59:38.979
how many persons were present
when you entered the home?

59:39.014 --> 59:41.080
- There was the first
responder and his partner

59:41.115 --> 59:42.785
and the two injured.

59:42.820 --> 59:44.182
- And who were the injured?

59:44.217 --> 59:47.185
- Their names were recorded
as Mr. Lester A. McCubbin

59:47.220 --> 59:49.660
and Mrs. Sarah Jane McCubbin.

59:49.695 --> 59:51.321
- Are either of them here today?

59:51.356 --> 59:53.059
Please indicate them.

59:53.094 --> 59:55.292
- Mr.
McCubbin is right there.

59:55.327 --> 59:57.899
- Did you see any signs
of any third party?

59:59.463 --> 1:00:01.100
- There were three
table settings,

1:00:01.135 --> 1:00:04.873
dishes, glasses, and
stuff, but otherwise, no.

1:00:04.908 --> 1:00:08.008
- Have you ever
responded to a suicide?

1:00:08.043 --> 1:00:09.109
- Yes ma'am.

1:00:09.144 --> 1:00:12.177
- And is it safe
to say that every instance

1:00:12.212 --> 1:00:13.783
is, is different?

1:00:13.818 --> 1:00:15.180
- Yes, ma'am.

1:00:15.215 --> 1:00:17.314
- Have you ever responded
to an accidental death?

1:00:17.349 --> 1:00:18.788
- Yes.

1:00:18.823 --> 1:00:20.449
- And are these
fairly unique as well?

1:00:20.484 --> 1:00:21.923
- Yes, ma'am.

1:00:21.958 --> 1:00:23.320
- What about a
homicide, Ms. Sanchez?

1:00:23.355 --> 1:00:25.388
How many of these
have you responded to?

1:00:25.423 --> 1:00:26.862
- Too many.

1:00:26.897 --> 1:00:28.930
- And those
again are unique?

1:00:28.965 --> 1:00:30.162
- Yes, ma'am.

1:00:30.197 --> 1:00:32.428
- Ms. Sanchez, based
on your experience

1:00:32.463 --> 1:00:35.068
of all of these terrible events,

1:00:35.103 --> 1:00:39.270
would you say you can draw
conclusions about an event

1:00:39.305 --> 1:00:41.074
without all the explicit detail?

1:00:41.109 --> 1:00:41.975
- Objection, Your Honor.

1:00:42.010 --> 1:00:44.044
Ms. Sanchez is not
trained in forensics.

1:00:44.079 --> 1:00:45.342
- I will sustain.

1:00:45.377 --> 1:00:47.146
Ms. Jones, do you wish
to rephrase the question?

1:00:47.181 --> 1:00:48.147
- Yes, Your Honor.

1:00:49.821 --> 1:00:51.315
What was the nature of the
injuries you were called

1:00:51.350 --> 1:00:53.317
to the address to treat?

1:00:53.352 --> 1:00:55.253
- I was there to
stabilize Mr. McCubbin

1:00:55.288 --> 1:00:59.290
who had received a number of
blunt force impact injuries.

1:00:59.325 --> 1:01:00.962
- What was your impression
as to how Mr. McCubbin

1:01:00.997 --> 1:01:02.063
had received these injuries?

1:01:02.098 --> 1:01:04.130
- They were consistent with
many of the car accidents

1:01:04.165 --> 1:01:05.164
I've responded to.

1:01:05.200 --> 1:01:09.135
For example, the body
experiences a sudden impact

1:01:09.170 --> 1:01:11.137
from an immobile object.

1:01:11.172 --> 1:01:13.205
- Like a wall or a stove?

1:01:14.439 --> 1:01:16.879
- Yes, in this case,
that could be the cause.

1:01:18.080 --> 1:01:20.146
- Could these injuries
be self-inflicted?

1:01:22.249 --> 1:01:23.081
- I mean, yeah, sure.

1:01:23.117 --> 1:01:25.283
If you run into a
wall fast enough.

1:01:25.318 --> 1:01:27.186
- Seems pretty farfetched.

1:01:27.221 --> 1:01:29.023
- Objection. She's
mocking my client.

1:01:29.058 --> 1:01:31.927
- Ms. Jones, is there a point
to this line of questioning?

1:01:32.996 --> 1:01:35.227
- Ms. Sanchez, humor me.

1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:38.934
If you wanted it to look like
someone had attacked you,

1:01:38.969 --> 1:01:40.166
what would be an
easy way to do it?

1:01:40.201 --> 1:01:42.069
- Objection. She's
clearly leading.

1:01:42.104 --> 1:01:44.368
- Ms. Jones, if you don't
have any productive questions,

1:01:44.403 --> 1:01:47.437
I'll have to ask you to
conclude your questioning.

1:01:47.472 --> 1:01:48.911
- The prosecution rests.

1:01:51.377 --> 1:01:52.475
- I didn't run into a wall.

1:01:53.412 --> 1:01:54.785
- Good job.

1:01:54.820 --> 1:01:56.248
Just let me handle this.

1:01:56.283 --> 1:01:59.548
- Mr. Frazer, it's your cross.

1:01:59.583 --> 1:02:01.220
- Thank you, Your Honor.

1:02:01.255 --> 1:02:03.926
Ms. Sanchez, have you ever
played chicken before?

1:02:05.292 --> 1:02:06.962
Let me explain.

1:02:06.997 --> 1:02:08.128
Chicken is a game where you
see how close you can get-

1:02:08.163 --> 1:02:09.866
- I'm
familiar with it, yes.

1:02:09.901 --> 1:02:11.461
- Good, now, you
describe your profession

1:02:11.496 --> 1:02:13.133
as that of an EMT.

1:02:14.169 --> 1:02:17.335
Do you perform forensic work
in your normal course of duty?

1:02:17.370 --> 1:02:18.567
- No.

1:02:18.602 --> 1:02:20.206
- Did you the night of
the alleged incident

1:02:20.241 --> 1:02:22.274
perform forensic work?

1:02:22.309 --> 1:02:24.111
- No, sir.

1:02:24.146 --> 1:02:25.079
- Thank you.

1:02:25.114 --> 1:02:26.916
Can you say with
certainty that my client,

1:02:26.951 --> 1:02:29.820
Mr. McCubbin, ran into a wall?

1:02:30.955 --> 1:02:32.350
- No.

1:02:32.385 --> 1:02:36.123
- How about a stove as
Ms. Jones suggested?

1:02:36.961 --> 1:02:38.127
- No.

1:02:38.162 --> 1:02:42.591
- Can you make any claim that
my client did anything at all

1:02:42.626 --> 1:02:46.331
apart from being in the room
and being alive that night?

1:02:46.366 --> 1:02:47.232
- No.

1:02:47.267 --> 1:02:49.235
- You seem like a pretty
intelligent woman.

1:02:49.270 --> 1:02:51.270
Now, it wouldn't take
very long for a woman

1:02:51.305 --> 1:02:54.438
as smart as you to draw some
pretty reasonable conclusions

1:02:54.473 --> 1:02:57.309
about what happened
there that night.

1:02:57.344 --> 1:02:58.310
- I suppose.

1:02:58.345 --> 1:03:00.279
- But they still would
be assumptions, right?

1:03:02.448 --> 1:03:03.547
Huh?

1:03:03.583 --> 1:03:08.485
Ethically, can you even
suggest that he did it himself?

1:03:09.290 --> 1:03:10.520
Hurt himself?

1:03:10.555 --> 1:03:12.192
- No.

1:03:12.227 --> 1:03:15.129
- And were you in the room when
the injuries were inflicted?

1:03:16.066 --> 1:03:17.395
- No, I was not.

1:03:17.430 --> 1:03:19.870
- So as a person with
no forensic background

1:03:21.302 --> 1:03:24.369
and with no information than
what you saw there that night

1:03:24.404 --> 1:03:27.042
and giving
conflicting testimony,

1:03:27.077 --> 1:03:30.078
can you say with
confidence how my client

1:03:30.113 --> 1:03:31.310
received his injuries?

1:03:34.612 --> 1:03:36.183
- No.

1:03:36.218 --> 1:03:37.217
- One more question.

1:03:39.551 --> 1:03:41.089
Do you feel that your
time in the stand

1:03:41.124 --> 1:03:42.992
is being put to good use?

1:03:43.027 --> 1:03:43.993
- Objection.

1:03:44.028 --> 1:03:45.258
- Sustained.
- Sustained.

1:03:45.293 --> 1:03:46.622
- Mr. Frazer, I'll
ask you to refrain

1:03:46.657 --> 1:03:49.196
from antagonistic
questioning in my courtroom.

1:03:49.231 --> 1:03:50.296
- Yes, Your Honor.

1:03:50.331 --> 1:03:51.968
The defense rests.

1:03:52.003 --> 1:03:53.464
- Redirect, Ms. Jones?

1:03:53.499 --> 1:03:55.301
- No, Your Honor.
- Good.

1:03:55.336 --> 1:03:57.336
I'm gonna call a
recess for lunch.

1:04:00.473 --> 1:04:02.077
- Okay.

1:04:02.112 --> 1:04:03.309
I think we're doing good,

1:04:03.344 --> 1:04:05.113
but we're not out
of the woods yet.

1:04:05.148 --> 1:04:07.412
Dana's a real
snatch, but I think-

1:04:07.447 --> 1:04:08.545
- Why am I even here?

1:04:11.055 --> 1:04:13.924
- Les, we are here to
determine whether or not

1:04:13.959 --> 1:04:15.354
you go to trial for murder.

1:04:16.489 --> 1:04:18.192
Surely you understand
that by now.

1:04:19.360 --> 1:04:22.328
- I didn't kill anyone.

1:04:22.363 --> 1:04:25.199
- They believe you did.
I believe you did it.

1:04:25.234 --> 1:04:26.332
We need to show them.

1:04:26.367 --> 1:04:28.169
- You're supposed
to be on my side.

1:04:28.204 --> 1:04:29.203
- I am on your side.

1:04:30.536 --> 1:04:33.669
We are here to show them
that you couldn't possibly

1:04:33.704 --> 1:04:35.671
have killed anyone on purpose,

1:04:35.706 --> 1:04:38.443
and that you can't defend
yourself in a right mind.

1:04:40.546 --> 1:04:41.512
Can you trust me?

1:04:42.515 --> 1:04:44.614
- I didn't kill anyone.

1:04:44.649 --> 1:04:47.452
- Les, we can't have
that debate now.

1:04:47.487 --> 1:04:50.290
Just stay crazy
and we'll be fine.

1:04:56.694 --> 1:05:00.366
- I'm not crazy.

1:05:01.501 --> 1:05:03.336
- Do you wanna
stay in the room

1:05:03.371 --> 1:05:04.205
or do you want a custodian?

1:05:07.771 --> 1:05:08.605
Stay in the room.

1:05:17.781 --> 1:05:18.989
- I'm crazy.

1:05:20.652 --> 1:05:22.520
He's gonna kill her.

1:05:25.294 --> 1:05:26.128
I'm not crazy.

1:05:27.065 --> 1:05:29.494
I gotta, I gotta stop him.

1:05:29.529 --> 1:05:30.693
You can't do it, Addie.

1:05:32.433 --> 1:05:34.499
Mom loves me and likes me.

1:05:35.700 --> 1:05:38.470
I gotta stop you. I'm not crazy.

1:05:40.342 --> 1:05:43.607
Okay, I can. I gotta, I gotta.

1:05:56.292 --> 1:05:57.654
- Les, I wanted to talk to you.

1:05:58.525 --> 1:06:00.096
- Better not wander around.

1:06:00.131 --> 1:06:01.526
They'll put you in cuffs.

1:06:01.561 --> 1:06:03.528
I'll stay with him, Dan.

1:06:03.563 --> 1:06:05.662
So you, uh, wanna
grab some lunch?

1:06:07.237 --> 1:06:08.038
Huh?

1:06:08.073 --> 1:06:08.698
Come on, join me.

1:06:10.075 --> 1:06:12.669
Les? Les! Les! Stop!

1:06:14.838 --> 1:06:15.738
What's the matter?

1:06:18.479 --> 1:06:20.347
- I thought I saw him.

1:06:20.382 --> 1:06:22.547
- Listen, I can't talk
to you about things

1:06:22.582 --> 1:06:24.450
outside of the hearing,

1:06:24.485 --> 1:06:28.223
but I need you to try and
trust me and your lawyer.

1:06:28.258 --> 1:06:30.324
We're both doing whatever
we can to make sure you heal

1:06:30.359 --> 1:06:31.589
and do so as a free man.

1:06:33.131 --> 1:06:35.296
Please, please tell me
you understand this.

1:06:38.532 --> 1:06:40.136
- I'm, I'm trying.

1:06:41.667 --> 1:06:43.535
- Okay.

1:06:43.570 --> 1:06:46.505
Okay, I believe you.

1:06:46.540 --> 1:06:48.573
And let's get you some
coffee, okay, man?

1:06:53.712 --> 1:06:54.513
- Over here.

1:06:54.548 --> 1:06:55.514
- All right, all right.

1:07:01.324 --> 1:07:02.521
Now what?

1:07:02.556 --> 1:07:04.424
- We've got
another one up here.

1:07:05.427 --> 1:07:06.360
- Go.

1:07:07.858 --> 1:07:09.429
- There was an
anonymous phone call

1:07:09.464 --> 1:07:12.366
and we had responded
at around 2200 hours.

1:07:12.401 --> 1:07:14.467
We were led in by two uniforms.

1:07:14.502 --> 1:07:16.502
- The witness
refers to police officers.

1:07:16.537 --> 1:07:18.537
- Yes, sir.

1:07:18.572 --> 1:07:20.308
- You attended
to my client right away?

1:07:20.343 --> 1:07:22.145
- Yes, sir.

1:07:22.180 --> 1:07:23.509
- Where were
you, Mr. Kirkpatrick,

1:07:23.544 --> 1:07:25.445
while your partner was
tending to the injuries

1:07:25.480 --> 1:07:27.414
of Mr. McCubbin in the kitchen?

1:07:27.449 --> 1:07:30.615
- I was in a bedroom attempting
to revive the second victim.

1:07:30.650 --> 1:07:31.550
- Miss McCubbin?

1:07:31.585 --> 1:07:33.387
- Yes.

1:07:33.422 --> 1:07:34.685
- Please describe her.

1:07:36.161 --> 1:07:40.196
- Approximately 60 years
of age, 160 pounds.

1:07:40.231 --> 1:07:42.792
She was lying in her bed
and had stopped breathing.

1:07:47.469 --> 1:07:48.435
I think she's dead.

1:07:51.770 --> 1:07:53.143
- What
a hero, this guy.

1:07:53.178 --> 1:07:55.508
- Maybe he should try
shaking her again.

1:07:59.316 --> 1:08:01.844
- Did she look
like the kind of woman

1:08:01.879 --> 1:08:04.649
who would be able
to defend herself?

1:08:04.684 --> 1:08:05.584
- Mom.

1:08:05.619 --> 1:08:06.418
- Mr. Frazer.

1:08:06.453 --> 1:08:08.290
- Les, you gotta
keep it down, okay?

1:08:11.394 --> 1:08:12.558
- Carry on, Ms. Jones.

1:08:13.627 --> 1:08:15.132
- Were you able to revive her?

1:08:15.794 --> 1:08:18.201
- No, it was far too late.

1:08:18.236 --> 1:08:19.862
She'd apparently been
dead for more than a hour.

1:08:21.338 --> 1:08:23.701
- Mr. Frazer, is your
client able to proceed?

1:08:23.736 --> 1:08:26.506
- Your Honor, I'd like to
request a brief recess.

1:08:30.215 --> 1:08:34.745
Les, this is your chance
to set the record straight.

1:08:36.683 --> 1:08:38.914
- I just wanna go back to
the hospital and sleep.

1:08:40.258 --> 1:08:41.653
- Let's just get through this

1:08:41.688 --> 1:08:44.458
and then you can sleep
as long as you'd like.

1:08:44.493 --> 1:08:46.394
- I don't, I don't want to.

1:08:46.429 --> 1:08:51.300
- Les, you were the
only one in the room.

1:08:52.468 --> 1:08:53.665
If we're going to
hear the truth,

1:08:53.700 --> 1:08:55.502
we have to hear it from you.

1:08:58.705 --> 1:08:59.638
- He killed her.

1:09:00.938 --> 1:09:02.608
- Is that the truth?

1:09:02.643 --> 1:09:04.742
Is this what we're
going to hear up there?

1:09:10.321 --> 1:09:13.718
- There are, um, there
are pieces missing

1:09:15.920 --> 1:09:17.392
that don't make sense.

1:09:18.527 --> 1:09:20.692
- Don't think about
that right now.

1:09:20.727 --> 1:09:24.795
Right now we have to
concentrate on saving you.

1:09:25.798 --> 1:09:26.830
Okay?

1:09:28.471 --> 1:09:31.868
- They think I did it,
don't they?

1:09:33.608 --> 1:09:37.247
They think I killed
my mother.

1:09:42.848 --> 1:09:44.815
- Is this the
report returned by the lab

1:09:44.850 --> 1:09:46.784
based on that DNA evidence?

1:09:47.787 --> 1:09:49.556
- Yes. ma'am. It is.

1:09:49.591 --> 1:09:51.558
- Reading from the
report, Detective,

1:09:51.593 --> 1:09:54.462
the DNA of how many
individuals were found

1:09:54.497 --> 1:09:56.431
in the victim's kitchen?

1:09:56.466 --> 1:09:57.300
- Two.

1:09:58.699 --> 1:10:01.502
- And who does the report
identify those individuals as?

1:10:02.604 --> 1:10:04.736
- The victim, Sarah
Jane McCubbin,

1:10:04.771 --> 1:10:08.707
and her son, Lester A. McCubbin.

1:10:08.742 --> 1:10:10.478
- Just to be clear, Detective,

1:10:10.513 --> 1:10:14.746
does the report make any
mention of an Addison McCubbin

1:10:14.781 --> 1:10:16.550
or any third party?

1:10:17.718 --> 1:10:18.618
- No, ma'am.

1:10:19.786 --> 1:10:20.851
- Mr. Frazer, do you
have any questions

1:10:20.886 --> 1:10:21.852
for Detective Robinson?

1:10:22.987 --> 1:10:24.987
- No, Your Honor.
- Very well.

1:10:25.022 --> 1:10:26.428
You may be excused.

1:10:28.927 --> 1:10:30.729
Is your client ready to testify?

1:10:34.504 --> 1:10:35.404
- Yes, Your Honor.

1:11:12.773 --> 1:11:15.378
- Mr. McCubbin, could you
please tell us where you were

1:11:15.413 --> 1:11:18.744
at seven o'clock on the evening
of April 9th of this year?

1:11:20.649 --> 1:11:22.616
- I, I guess we were
driving around then.

1:11:22.651 --> 1:11:23.782
- Where from?

1:11:23.817 --> 1:11:25.421
- Southeast Portland.

1:11:25.456 --> 1:11:29.084
- When you say we, Mr. McCubbin,
to whom are you referring?

1:11:30.120 --> 1:11:32.659
- Me and my twin
brother Addison.

1:11:32.694 --> 1:11:33.990
- Oh.

1:11:34.025 --> 1:11:35.827
Are you identical?

1:11:35.862 --> 1:11:36.696
- Fraternal.

1:11:37.732 --> 1:11:39.567
- Would you say that it
would be easy for a person

1:11:39.602 --> 1:11:42.603
to mistake you for
him and vice versa?

1:11:42.638 --> 1:11:45.408
- No, um, we're very
different.

1:11:45.443 --> 1:11:47.806
He's tall, blonde, athletic.

1:11:47.841 --> 1:11:49.544
- What was your
intended destination?

1:11:49.579 --> 1:11:52.448
- We were going to visit
our mother in Marston.

1:11:52.483 --> 1:11:55.484
- Was it
just a social call?

1:11:55.519 --> 1:11:56.881
- It, um.

1:11:58.489 --> 1:12:00.819
What do you mean? I guess so.

1:12:00.854 --> 1:12:02.986
- I mean, did you go
there with a specific purpose

1:12:03.021 --> 1:12:05.120
in mind or did you
just go there to visit?

1:12:07.795 --> 1:12:12.468
- Um, we hadn't visited,
visited her in a while,

1:12:12.503 --> 1:12:16.703
and Addison wanted to talk,
talk to her about something.

1:12:16.738 --> 1:12:18.034
- What was that?

1:12:18.069 --> 1:12:21.741
- Her health is failing
and it's getting harder

1:12:21.776 --> 1:12:23.446
for her to do things,

1:12:23.481 --> 1:12:26.416
so we had to talk about
putting her in assisted living.

1:12:27.619 --> 1:12:30.079
- Had you discussed this
with your mother previously?

1:12:31.016 --> 1:12:32.488
- I tried.

1:12:32.523 --> 1:12:33.984
She doesn't like
to talk about it,

1:12:34.019 --> 1:12:37.053
and she gets confused
and irritable.

1:12:38.760 --> 1:12:41.123
- Had you talked
about it with anybody else?

1:12:41.158 --> 1:12:42.828
- Just Addie.

1:12:42.863 --> 1:12:44.995
- I assume
when you say Addie,

1:12:45.030 --> 1:12:47.701
you're talking about that
which you call Addison?

1:12:48.902 --> 1:12:49.967
What did he think?

1:12:52.202 --> 1:12:54.774
- Um, I guess
he hated the idea.

1:12:56.008 --> 1:12:57.843
- Was this
type of disagreement

1:12:57.878 --> 1:13:00.043
typical with your brother?

1:13:00.078 --> 1:13:01.979
- No.

1:13:02.014 --> 1:13:06.115
We disagree sometimes, but
not about anything so serious.

1:13:07.954 --> 1:13:09.987
- So you said that you
arrived to your mother's house

1:13:10.022 --> 1:13:11.923
at about eight
o'clock that evening.

1:13:11.958 --> 1:13:12.957
Is that correct?

1:13:12.992 --> 1:13:14.530
- Yeah, that sounds about right.

1:13:14.565 --> 1:13:16.499
- Can you tell
us what happened then?

1:13:16.534 --> 1:13:20.899
- Addison was giving
me the silent treatment,

1:13:20.934 --> 1:13:22.967
which normally means
he's planning something.

1:13:24.036 --> 1:13:25.739
- What was he planning?

1:13:27.072 --> 1:13:27.972
- I don't know.

1:13:28.007 --> 1:13:29.105
I couldn't figure him out.

1:13:30.515 --> 1:13:33.582
- Were you
worried about violence?

1:13:33.617 --> 1:13:35.012
- No. No.

1:13:35.047 --> 1:13:38.950
Addison would never
hurt anybody physically.

1:13:38.985 --> 1:13:40.050
I mean, but.

1:13:42.791 --> 1:13:43.856
- But?

1:13:44.991 --> 1:13:47.123
- He was, uh, different.

1:13:48.566 --> 1:13:50.060
Not, not who he means to be.

1:13:51.734 --> 1:13:55.472
Like he, he didn't like
that I disagreed with him.

1:13:56.640 --> 1:13:58.475
- What did
you disagree about?

1:14:01.843 --> 1:14:06.846
- Addison and I have different
opinions on euthanasia.

1:14:08.047 --> 1:14:09.013
- So he wanted to
kill your mother?

1:14:09.782 --> 1:14:13.083
- No, he wanted
to make her happy.

1:14:15.560 --> 1:14:19.254
Give her peace, help her
live life on her own terms.

1:14:19.289 --> 1:14:20.695
I understand that now.

1:14:20.730 --> 1:14:21.763
- So you suddenly
agree with him?

1:14:21.798 --> 1:14:26.866
- No, no, he just, he
thinks bigger than I can.

1:14:26.901 --> 1:14:29.770
He's, difficult decisions
don't scare him.

1:14:29.805 --> 1:14:31.266
He's, he's braver than I am.

1:14:31.301 --> 1:14:34.137
- You think killing your
own mother is bravery?

1:14:34.172 --> 1:14:35.677
- No, that's not what I said.

1:14:35.712 --> 1:14:38.108
I said he's braver with
difficult decisions.

1:14:39.309 --> 1:14:41.683
He didn't want to kill Mom.

1:14:41.718 --> 1:14:45.984
You wanted to give her life,
a final chapter of joy.

1:14:46.786 --> 1:14:48.921
- You make
it sound romantic.

1:14:49.825 --> 1:14:52.056
- I guess it is in a way.

1:14:52.091 --> 1:14:54.025
- Murder isn't
romantic, Mr. McCubbin.

1:14:54.060 --> 1:14:54.859
It's against the law!

1:14:54.894 --> 1:14:56.962
- What Addison
wanted isn't murder.

1:14:56.997 --> 1:15:00.130
- Taking another
person's life is murder.

1:15:00.165 --> 1:15:02.033
Mr. McCubbin, you have
now told us your plan,

1:15:02.068 --> 1:15:03.936
you've told us your motives.

1:15:03.971 --> 1:15:07.137
Why don't you now just tell
us that you did it, Les?

1:15:07.172 --> 1:15:09.843
Tell us how sick you really are.

1:15:10.779 --> 1:15:12.846
- You must be so lonely
in that little head

1:15:12.881 --> 1:15:14.683
of yours, Ms. Jones.

1:15:14.718 --> 1:15:15.948
- What?

1:15:15.983 --> 1:15:17.983
- Always looking for
that moment to strike.

1:15:18.018 --> 1:15:20.018
- Mr. McCubbin, I'm warning you!

1:15:20.053 --> 1:15:22.185
- Is there a room
in there, Ms. Jones,

1:15:22.220 --> 1:15:25.056
where you entertain all
the children who hated you?

1:15:25.091 --> 1:15:27.157
Who was the first
to call you cunt?

1:15:28.028 --> 1:15:29.093
Cunt.

1:15:29.128 --> 1:15:30.061
- Order!

1:15:30.096 --> 1:15:32.096
- Mr. Frazer, get your
client under control!

1:15:32.131 --> 1:15:33.867
- Les.

1:15:33.902 --> 1:15:35.330
- I'm sorry, everyone.

1:15:35.365 --> 1:15:37.299
The truth is, I don't remember
what happened that night.

1:15:37.334 --> 1:15:39.873
It was awfully scary,
and I woke up like this.

1:15:39.908 --> 1:15:40.709
- Order!

1:15:40.744 --> 1:15:42.106
- Stop it.

1:15:42.141 --> 1:15:43.274
- I will have order
in my courtroom.

1:15:43.309 --> 1:15:45.714
Mr. Frazer, have a conference
with your client right now!

1:15:45.749 --> 1:15:47.078
Make sure he comes back
with a little respect

1:15:47.113 --> 1:15:48.783
or I'll hold you
both in contempt.

1:15:48.818 --> 1:15:49.718
- Yes, Your Honor.

1:15:54.923 --> 1:15:57.627
- I won't
let you kill Mom.

1:15:57.662 --> 1:15:58.826
- Les, you're too late.

1:16:06.231 --> 1:16:08.902
You were too weak,
like you always were!

1:16:08.937 --> 1:16:11.234
I only did it because
no one else would.

1:16:15.405 --> 1:16:18.175
You really wanted me gone, huh?

1:16:18.210 --> 1:16:19.781
Sweet Les.

1:16:53.113 --> 1:16:55.047
- You told us that you fought
in your mother's kitchen

1:16:55.082 --> 1:16:56.114
with your brother.

1:16:56.149 --> 1:16:57.214
Is that correct?

1:16:57.249 --> 1:16:58.919
- Yes.

1:16:58.954 --> 1:17:00.316
- And you would have us
believe that this brother

1:17:00.351 --> 1:17:03.187
also murdered your mother
just several minutes earlier?

1:17:06.159 --> 1:17:07.697
- Yes.

1:17:07.732 --> 1:17:09.160
- And you tried
to save her life?

1:17:11.131 --> 1:17:13.395
- A verbal response
please, Mr. McCubbin.

1:17:16.004 --> 1:17:17.037
- Yes.

1:17:17.072 --> 1:17:19.434
- That's a very noble
thing to do, Mr. McCubbin,

1:17:19.469 --> 1:17:23.911
but tell me, how is it
possible that Ms. Sanchez,

1:17:23.946 --> 1:17:26.881
Mr. Kirkpatrick, neither
of them saw any sign

1:17:26.916 --> 1:17:28.718
of your brother when they
responded to the call

1:17:28.753 --> 1:17:29.884
at your mother's house?

1:17:31.118 --> 1:17:32.282
- I don't know.

1:17:32.317 --> 1:17:33.822
- And Detective
Robinson has told us

1:17:33.857 --> 1:17:37.760
that the DNA showed no
sign of this Addison

1:17:37.795 --> 1:17:38.959
being at the crime scene.

1:17:38.994 --> 1:17:40.796
How, how was that possible?

1:17:40.831 --> 1:17:41.456
- I, uh. I just-

1:17:43.064 --> 1:17:46.098
- In fact, none of the
neighbors who testified

1:17:46.133 --> 1:17:50.003
ever heard your mother
speak of a son named Addison

1:17:50.038 --> 1:17:53.743
in the over 30 years that
she lived in Marston.

1:17:55.307 --> 1:17:58.209
Where is Addison, Mr. McCubbin?

1:18:00.213 --> 1:18:02.180
- He didn't get
out to visit much.

1:18:02.215 --> 1:18:03.885
- Oh.

1:18:03.920 --> 1:18:07.119
And you would have the court
believe that your brother,

1:18:07.154 --> 1:18:10.155
who you claimed to have
injured and who left no trace

1:18:10.190 --> 1:18:13.026
of his bleeding self
on the crime scene,

1:18:13.061 --> 1:18:17.459
simply disappeared after
he smothered your mother

1:18:17.494 --> 1:18:18.295
with a pillow.

1:18:18.330 --> 1:18:21.034
- I said I don't know!

1:18:21.069 --> 1:18:22.332
I can't just remember!

1:18:22.367 --> 1:18:25.269
- The witness will
remain seated.

1:18:25.304 --> 1:18:26.875
Mr. Frazer, you will see to it

1:18:26.910 --> 1:18:28.910
that your client
restrains himself.

1:18:28.945 --> 1:18:30.307
- Yes, Your Honor.

1:18:30.342 --> 1:18:33.013
- Mr. McCubbin, this
is your last warning.

1:18:35.985 --> 1:18:37.446
You can continue. Ms. Jones.

1:18:37.481 --> 1:18:39.382
- Thank you, Your Honor.

1:18:39.417 --> 1:18:42.385
So, you have no memory
of the events that night,

1:18:42.420 --> 1:18:44.354
but you would expect
the court to believe

1:18:44.389 --> 1:18:47.489
your word over the
testimony of state experts?

1:18:48.899 --> 1:18:52.934
- I can't just remember.

1:18:52.969 --> 1:18:55.266
- So you don't really care
who murdered your mother?

1:18:55.301 --> 1:18:56.938
- Objection.
- Overruled.

1:18:58.271 --> 1:18:59.435
- I have no more questions.

1:19:03.540 --> 1:19:05.276
- Well, when Lester was little,

1:19:06.884 --> 1:19:10.281
he would often include
his twin brother Addison,

1:19:10.316 --> 1:19:14.516
and I would go along,

1:19:15.618 --> 1:19:17.926
but of course it
was just a game.

1:19:17.961 --> 1:19:19.455
- What sort of game?

1:19:19.490 --> 1:19:23.426
- Well, I assumed
Lester had heard a story

1:19:23.461 --> 1:19:27.331
and gotten carried away with it.

1:19:30.600 --> 1:19:33.337
- But there was something
more to it, wasn't there?

1:19:35.077 --> 1:19:36.538
- Well, yes.

1:19:36.573 --> 1:19:37.979
- Please explain.

1:19:40.214 --> 1:19:42.951
- Well, I assisted
with the delivery.

1:19:45.956 --> 1:19:47.582
- Whose delivery, Ms. Sturdley?

1:19:47.617 --> 1:19:49.386
- Lester and Addison's.

1:19:50.994 --> 1:19:53.324
- Lester and Addison's.

1:19:54.426 --> 1:19:56.393
So there were two children.

1:19:56.428 --> 1:20:00.463
- Well, it was a, a
very difficult birth.

1:20:02.632 --> 1:20:06.370
- Can you describe for the
court this difficult birth

1:20:07.106 --> 1:20:09.274
that has left such
an impression on you?

1:20:09.309 --> 1:20:10.143
- Yes, well.

1:20:11.410 --> 1:20:16.380
It had been a perfectly
orderly pregnancy,

1:20:16.415 --> 1:20:18.151
but the ultrasound

1:20:19.187 --> 1:20:22.452
showed a very rare anomaly.

1:20:22.487 --> 1:20:24.355
- And what
anomaly was that?

1:20:24.390 --> 1:20:29.459
- It appeared that the
blastocyst had fused.

1:20:30.228 --> 1:20:33.397
- Can you please explain
that in layman's terms

1:20:33.432 --> 1:20:35.234
for the court?

1:20:35.269 --> 1:20:40.272
- The chorion, which is
the outside enclosure.

1:20:41.308 --> 1:20:45.277
It was shared, and that's
something you usually only see

1:20:45.312 --> 1:20:47.279
in identical twins.

1:20:47.314 --> 1:20:48.544
- Hmm.

1:20:48.579 --> 1:20:50.678
Did this development
complicate the pregnancy?

1:20:50.713 --> 1:20:53.417
- No,
not in and of itself,

1:20:53.452 --> 1:20:56.486
but it did complicate
the delivery.

1:20:56.521 --> 1:20:57.322
- How so?

1:20:58.523 --> 1:21:01.128
- Well, early in
the eighth month,

1:21:01.163 --> 1:21:06.001
both boy's amniotic sacs
ruptured simultaneously.

1:21:07.400 --> 1:21:11.138
The doctor thought that
some outside physical trauma

1:21:11.173 --> 1:21:14.636
was the cause, but
Mrs. McCubbin insisted

1:21:14.671 --> 1:21:17.111
that no such thing had occurred.

1:21:18.312 --> 1:21:19.641
- What did
this rupture mean?

1:21:21.480 --> 1:21:25.449
- Well, that the babies were
coming early, of course.

1:21:27.090 --> 1:21:31.191
Normally the twins will
deliver sequentially

1:21:31.226 --> 1:21:33.391
within minutes of each other,

1:21:33.426 --> 1:21:36.295
but the McCubbin
babies had become

1:21:36.330 --> 1:21:38.660
interlocked face-to-face,

1:21:40.400 --> 1:21:42.433
as though in an embrace,

1:21:42.468 --> 1:21:46.536
so it was impossible
for them to pass through

1:21:46.571 --> 1:21:48.736
the birth canal this way.

1:21:48.771 --> 1:21:51.673
The doctor began a C-section.

1:21:51.708 --> 1:21:53.510
- And what
was the result?

1:21:54.312 --> 1:21:57.415
- Little Lester was
delivered successfully

1:21:57.450 --> 1:21:59.054
within minutes, but, uh,

1:22:00.783 --> 1:22:05.995
it was only after we
extracted him from the womb

1:22:07.394 --> 1:22:11.297
that we discovered he was not
entirely free of his twin.

1:22:11.966 --> 1:22:14.971
One of his tiny little fists

1:22:16.370 --> 1:22:20.702
had closed around dear
Addison's umbilical cord.

1:22:22.145 --> 1:22:25.575
Like when you clamp
a garden hose,

1:22:26.710 --> 1:22:30.481
little Lester had
strangled his brother.

1:22:30.516 --> 1:22:33.715
- It's a lie!

1:22:34.586 --> 1:22:35.585
- Order!

1:22:35.620 --> 1:22:37.455
- Died in the womb!

1:22:37.490 --> 1:22:38.289
- Order!

1:22:38.324 --> 1:22:39.490
- Get down!

1:22:39.525 --> 1:22:41.195
- Order! Order!

1:22:42.132 --> 1:22:42.724
- Hey!

1:22:42.759 --> 1:22:44.198
Take a good look!

1:22:45.168 --> 1:22:46.167
- Les!

1:22:46.202 --> 1:22:48.433
- Yeah, Les! Stop him!

1:22:48.468 --> 1:22:49.500
Stop mean, old Addie.

1:22:51.141 --> 1:22:53.372
I'll show you my birthday suit.

1:22:53.407 --> 1:22:55.143
Maybe then you'll recognize me.

1:22:56.641 --> 1:22:58.443
- Addison!

1:22:58.478 --> 1:22:59.477
Hey! Stop!

1:22:59.512 --> 1:23:01.215
- Like what you see, Doc?

1:23:03.252 --> 1:23:04.515
