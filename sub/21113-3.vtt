00:02.203 --> 00:04.305
- All right, people,
pay attention,

00:04.338 --> 00:05.573
because these three young women
are on fire.

00:05.606 --> 00:07.041
Jane finally got her dream job

00:07.075 --> 00:09.043
but learned it won't be easy,

00:09.077 --> 00:11.245
especially when she received
her first assignment.

00:11.279 --> 00:13.547
- She wants me to do
a "best orgasm" piece.

00:13.581 --> 00:15.483
- You see,
Jane has never had an orgasm,

00:15.516 --> 00:19.287
but the assignment did help her
make new friends.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.455
Sutton,
hard-working and diligent,

00:21.489 --> 00:23.191

if the competition

00:23.224 --> 00:24.792
was Manhattan's best assistant.

00:24.825 --> 00:25.793
- Lauren Park's office.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.328
- But Sutton is ready for more.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.297
- What's your dream?
- Fashion.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.532
- And Kat was busy
managing "Scarlet" magazine's

00:31.565 --> 00:33.834
social media account
and even busier

00:33.867 --> 00:36.137
managing
her own volatile spirit.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.405
- Well, then, I guess
I'll just have to show them

00:37.438 --> 00:38.572
a woman defying them.

00:38.606 --> 00:40.341
- Because Kat has found herself

00:40.374 --> 00:42.610
unexpectedly smitten.

00:42.643 --> 00:46.514
These are the women
of "The Bold Type."

- Sure.

01:16.644 --> 01:18.612
- What are you working on?
- Okay.

01:18.646 --> 01:20.648
Let's just get this
out of the way.

01:20.681 --> 01:21.682
I kissed you.

01:21.715 --> 01:23.484
- And then ran.

01:23.517 --> 01:26.154
- Yes, I kissed you,
then ran.

01:26.187 --> 01:27.655
I don't really know
how to explain it.

01:27.688 --> 01:28.689
- You don't have to explain it.

01:28.722 --> 01:30.224
I read your article.

01:30.258 --> 01:32.593
You wanted to do
something unexpected.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.262
- So you read my article.

01:34.295 --> 01:37.565
- The one about
never having had an orgasm?

01:37.598 --> 01:39.433
Multiple times.

01:39.467 --> 01:42.170
You should be proud.

01:42.203 --> 01:46.174
- I don't know about proud,
but I'm not embarrassed.

01:46.207 --> 01:49.343
- I meant of the article.
- Right.

01:49.377 --> 01:51.679
- It was really truthful,
completely brave.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.647
- Thank you.

01:55.716 --> 01:58.152
What are you doing?

01:58.186 --> 01:59.653
gonna jump up and kiss me,

you probably would have

Ugh, so poetic.

Uh, we're not rivals.
It's not poetic.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.745
It's just a drink.

You need to get laid.

but she does.

I can't let you go on
a sex date

03:21.469 --> 03:23.671
looking like that.
- What is wrong with this?

03:23.704 --> 03:25.539
It's drinks, not a sex date.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.641
- Mmm, sounds like you're
working on a follow-up article.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.610
- Jacqueline, uh, no, actually.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.712
I wanted to pitch you something
while I have your attention.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.314
- You don't,
but if you can accept

03:33.347 --> 03:34.648
that I'm only half-listening,
proceed.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.650
- Congresswoman Helen Wolfe
is in town,

03:36.684 --> 03:38.452
and I would really love
to do a profile on her.

03:38.486 --> 03:40.321
She's relatively unknown,

03:40.354 --> 03:42.456
but I think she could be
the next Elizabeth Warren.

03:42.490 --> 03:43.991
- Kamala Harris is
the next Elizabeth Warren.

03:44.024 --> 03:46.327
- Then she's the next
Kamala Harris.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.462
- I know who she is.
She's interesting.

03:48.496 --> 03:49.797
- She's only in town
for a few days,

03:49.830 --> 03:51.665
so if you're okay with it,

03:51.699 --> 03:53.634
I would really like
to get started.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.403
- It's quite a departure
for you.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.271
- Which is exactly why
I want to do it.

03:57.305 --> 03:58.639
- Go ahead and reach out.
See if you can get an interview.

03:58.672 --> 04:01.475

it doesn't work out,

04:01.509 --> 04:03.344

to take a job at Bal-mane.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.727
- Balmain.
What?

04:19.760 --> 04:20.794
Are you sure?
- Positive.

when they were putting together
an outfit for me.

Why were the fashion interns

04:25.766 --> 04:27.735
putting together
an outfit for you?

to speak at the fundraiser

04:29.537 --> 04:30.804
about the men's health services
they offer,

04:30.838 --> 04:32.740
and she said
I need to represent the brand.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.442
- She wants you
to lose the khakis?

04:34.475 --> 04:35.709
- You're missing the point.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.378
There's an assistant's job

04:37.411 --> 04:40.348

right now.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.391
Can I take a message?

04:50.424 --> 04:51.759
- Let's go to dinner.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.394
- Lauren likes
to avoid dinner meetings.

04:53.427 --> 04:55.529
Can I schedule
something in-house?

04:55.563 --> 04:57.798

I want to take you out.

on Lauren's calendar.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.432
the possibilities are endless.

We could take our readers
through a private workout

05:33.634 --> 05:35.803
with one of our trainers
or even to the UN

05:35.836 --> 05:38.706
to see Emma Watson
give her speech on women.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.674
While we're launching,
we would let people

05:40.708 --> 05:42.510
try them out at events,

05:42.543 --> 05:43.811
give a certain number away
as freebies.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.679
More and more people
are owning VR goggles

05:47.147 --> 05:48.816
This is definitely
the next big thing,

to be the first magazine

05:51.852 --> 05:53.787
with their own VR app.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.723

presenting to the board,

05:55.756 --> 05:56.790
like, tomorrow?

05:56.824 --> 05:57.891
- I'd do great.

05:57.925 --> 05:58.926
- Yeah?
You think you'll be ready?

05:58.959 --> 06:00.728
- Yeah.

- All right. Great.
It's on their agenda.

06:02.796 --> 06:05.866
- All right.
- Oh, and Kat.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.735
This is your first time
presenting solo to the board.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.703
They can be intimidating.

06:09.737 --> 06:11.138
Be ready.

06:11.171 --> 06:13.641
- Oh, yeah.
I got it.

06:13.674 --> 06:17.878
Okay, uh, how's everyone
enjoying the fashion show?

06:17.911 --> 06:19.413
- I feel seasick.

06:19.447 --> 06:20.814

06:21.915 --> 06:23.884
- I think I'm gonna throw up.

06:23.917 --> 06:25.786
- Oh, no.
Really?

06:25.819 --> 06:28.789
Ugh, at least
you didn't throw up in my bag.

06:28.822 --> 06:33.527
Can I get you, like,
a toothbrush or some water?

06:33.561 --> 06:35.529
- Oliver, how bad is it?

06:35.563 --> 06:37.531
- Mom jeans
with fur slippers bad.

06:37.565 --> 06:39.767
- I can't even get
Jasmine Lee on the phone.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.201
Her publicist is apologetic--

06:41.234 --> 06:43.504
- I would hope so,
being that her designs

06:43.537 --> 06:45.005
were our entire fashion show,

06:45.038 --> 06:47.875
and we don't have
a fundraiser without her.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.743
How exactly did this happen?

06:49.777 --> 06:50.978
- She's about to launch
her collection

06:51.011 --> 06:52.646
at chain stores
across the country.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.682
They're pressuring her
to cut her ties

06:54.715 --> 06:56.183
with Planned Parenthood.

06:56.216 --> 06:57.518
- Well, Jasmine Lee can't stand

06:57.551 --> 06:58.752
behind her convictions,

06:58.786 --> 07:00.654
but we certainly stand
behind ours.

07:00.688 --> 07:01.922
- The event's in two days.

07:01.955 --> 07:02.923
- Is there any designer
out there

07:02.956 --> 07:04.825
worth anything

07:04.858 --> 07:06.660
who can pull something together
that fast?

07:06.694 --> 07:08.028
- No.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.799
We'll have to get creative.

07:11.832 --> 07:16.537
- We need looks that are bold
and strong and feminine.

07:16.570 --> 07:17.738
Unexpected.

07:17.771 --> 07:18.872
- Armor.
- Armor.

07:18.906 --> 07:20.941
- Focusing on the female form.

07:20.974 --> 07:23.744
I'll pair delicate items
from the closet with--

07:23.777 --> 07:27.047
- Sculptural accessory pieces.
- Exactly.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.582
I might need extra assistance.

07:28.616 --> 07:30.818
- I heard what happened.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.753
- Balmain is dead to me.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.555
- Well, you can have
all the interns.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.957
And I will approve overtime
for any assistants

07:36.990 --> 07:38.759
who want to work after hours.

07:38.792 --> 07:42.029
But Oliver, make this happen.

07:42.062 --> 07:48.602

07:48.636 --> 07:50.604

07:50.638 --> 07:52.973
about that position opening
in the fashion department,

07:53.006 --> 07:55.609
I was hoping
you'd put in a good word for me.

07:55.643 --> 07:56.810
- You literally
could not have picked

07:56.844 --> 07:58.612
a worse time
to talk to me about this.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.247
- I know.
I normally wouldn't bring it up.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.683
It's just those positions
get filled so quickly.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.885
- Sutton,
we have 10,000 things to do.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.854
Last week,
you were all about ad sales.

08:06.887 --> 08:08.822
I don't have time to explore
every whim with you.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.724
We can talk
after the fundraiser.

08:10.758 --> 08:11.859
- Okay.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.661
- I need you to start
on those RSVPs.

08:13.694 --> 08:16.797
Oh, and my green juice.
I need my juice.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.699
- I'll get right on it.

08:26.874 --> 08:29.743
Uh, Oliver?
- Do not bring me bad news.

08:29.777 --> 08:30.878
- So sorry to bother you.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.312
I just, uh,
wanted to let you know

08:32.345 --> 08:33.614
that if you need
anything this week--

08:33.647 --> 08:34.882
- Who are you again?

08:34.915 --> 08:36.884
- Sutton.
Brady.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.653
I was just, uh,
sitting behind you--

08:39.687 --> 08:40.854
- Sutton,
I need everything this week.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.022
- I'm--
I'm your girl.

08:42.055 --> 08:44.091
I would love to help.

08:45.926 --> 08:48.028
- Okay.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.730
Call these accessory designers

08:49.763 --> 08:51.765
and set up appointments
for me today.

08:51.799 --> 08:54.868
Line them up going downtown.

08:54.902 --> 08:57.070
- Okay.

08:57.104 --> 08:59.039
- You're free to go.
- Oh.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.574
Right, yeah.

09:00.608 --> 09:01.909
I'm on it.
You got it.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.816
- There hasn't been
an assistant position available

09:08.849 --> 09:09.883
in the fashion department
the entire time

09:09.917 --> 09:11.685
that I've worked here.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.186
This dress for tonight.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.855
[funky music]

09:14.888 --> 09:17.024
- Uh, it's not
that kind of date.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.026
- Then don't take it off.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.894
I don't know how I'm gonna cover
Lauren and Oliver this week,

09:20.928 --> 09:23.931
and if Lauren doesn't
help me get this job--

09:23.964 --> 09:25.833
- Ugh, she's the worst.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.701
I think Madeleine Albright was
actually referring to her

09:27.735 --> 09:29.837
when she said
there's a special place in hell

09:29.870 --> 09:31.705
for women
who don't help other women.

09:31.739 --> 09:33.173
- These boots...

09:33.206 --> 09:35.008
and I am not gonna let her
hold me back.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.710
- Good for you, babe.

09:36.744 --> 09:38.045
- Oh, I'm going
full "Hamilton" on this.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.179
'Cause I'm the definition
of young, scrappy,

09:39.212 --> 09:40.981
and hungry, and I'm out!

09:41.014 --> 09:42.282
- Oh!
Wow.

09:42.315 --> 09:43.651
Hey, sexy.

09:43.684 --> 09:44.918
- Hi.
- Ugh.

09:44.952 --> 09:47.054
[sighs]
Okay, so get this.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.922
I just got off the phone
with the VR people,

09:48.956 --> 09:50.724
told 'em about
my intern hurling.

09:50.758 --> 09:51.992
- Yeah?
- Guess what they asked me?

09:52.025 --> 09:53.927
- What?
- Is she currently menstruating?

09:53.961 --> 09:55.996
- What?
- Turns out...

09:56.029 --> 09:57.698
women are much more likely
to get motion sick from VR

09:57.731 --> 09:58.999
and especially when
we're menstruating.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.267
- Can you stop
saying "menstruating"?

10:00.300 --> 10:02.903
- No.
- Also, why is that?

10:02.936 --> 10:04.872
- Something technological.
Blah, blah, blah.

10:04.905 --> 10:07.240
Apparently, hormones play a part
in how we interpret images.

10:07.274 --> 10:11.078
- So VR is inadvertently sexist.
- No, it's "vertently" sexist.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.681
- That's not a word.
- Uh, it's definitely a word.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.883
I mean, they use technology
that favors the male brain.

10:15.916 --> 10:18.919
Ergo, "vertently" sexist.
- Hmm.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.821
- Anyway, I wrote
a little something about it

10:20.854 --> 10:23.924
for the digital site,
tweeted it out with the title,

10:23.957 --> 10:26.860
"Hey, VR Bros,
Don't Forget the Female Gaze."

10:26.894 --> 10:28.962
- Good title.
- Thank you.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.230
- What about your pitch?
- Oh, my pitch is so fine.

10:30.263 --> 10:31.965
Unless
one of those old white guys

10:31.999 --> 10:33.000
on the board
is currently menstruating.

10:33.033 --> 10:33.867
I know you love that word.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.769
- How do I look?

10:35.803 --> 10:37.971
- Uh, you look amazing.
[phone chimes]

10:38.005 --> 10:40.240
And I just got 300 responses.

10:40.273 --> 10:41.875
- Girl!

10:41.909 --> 10:43.844
[laughing]
Hey.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.345
- * Always under water...

10:45.378 --> 10:47.347
*

10:47.380 --> 10:48.882
- Cool place.

10:48.916 --> 10:51.852
So, are you an astronomy guy,

10:51.885 --> 10:53.987
or is this like
a "Rear Window" kind of thing?

10:54.021 --> 10:57.124
- Can't it be both?
- [chuckles]

10:57.157 --> 10:59.960
- Are you ever gonna sit down?
- I've read your column.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.763
I know what's happened
on that couch.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.064
- Oh, is that why
you won't sit down?

11:04.097 --> 11:06.734
I could get you
a towel or something.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.135
- No, thanks.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.970
So, does it ever bother you

11:10.003 --> 11:12.139
when people say
that you're just a sex writer?

11:12.172 --> 11:15.142
- Yes. Yes, it does.
That is offensively limiting.

11:15.175 --> 11:18.011
I write
about sex and relationships.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.980
Why do you ask?

11:20.013 --> 11:21.949
- I just--
I don't want

11:21.982 --> 11:27.955
my writing about sex
to be...my brand.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.189
- But you're so good at it.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.158
Seriously, you're honest.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.926
You've got a unique voice.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.796
- I want to write
about bigger things.

11:35.829 --> 11:38.899
- What's bigger
than sex and relationships?

11:38.932 --> 11:40.400
I'm serious.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.936
It's why a thousand ships
were launched.

11:42.970 --> 11:44.938
It's the reason we fight wars.

11:44.972 --> 11:47.140
We've impeached a president
'cause of sex.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.142
Why do you think
Vladimir Putin is riding

11:49.176 --> 11:51.812
around Russia on a horse
with no shirt on?

11:51.845 --> 11:55.148
It's 'cause some girl
rejected him in high school.

11:55.182 --> 11:58.051
- That's not true.
- It might be.

11:58.085 --> 12:02.255
The fact is,
it always comes back to sex.

12:02.289 --> 12:05.258
[music playing over stereo]

12:05.292 --> 12:10.030
*

12:10.063 --> 12:12.065
[phone buzzes]

12:14.067 --> 12:15.969
- Sorry.

12:18.872 --> 12:20.307
Oh, my God.
Ramon.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.875
- It's actually pronounced
"Ryan."

12:21.909 --> 12:24.211
- No, um, Ramon
is the door guy

12:24.244 --> 12:26.013
of this hotel
where Helen Wolfe,

12:26.046 --> 12:27.881
the congresswoman,
is staying,

12:27.915 --> 12:30.017
and I've been trying
to get an interview with her

12:30.050 --> 12:32.019
but I haven't been able
to get access.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.921
He just said
she ordered a town car

12:33.954 --> 12:35.355
and it's leaving in 20 minutes.

12:35.388 --> 12:38.358
- You really want to get
this story, don't you?

12:38.391 --> 12:40.460
- I do.

12:40.493 --> 12:44.364
*

12:44.397 --> 12:46.867
- Maybe we could pick
this conversation up again

12:46.900 --> 12:48.101
tomorrow night?

12:48.135 --> 12:50.370
- I'd like that.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.205
Thanks.

12:52.239 --> 12:57.044
*

12:57.077 --> 12:58.846
- These responses
are disgusting.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.380
- We're getting
amazing traffic, though.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.249
I started the conversation.

13:02.282 --> 13:05.085
- I'm not sure
if "Shut up, 'Scarlet' whores"

13:05.118 --> 13:07.254
is a conversation.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.090
- Okay, look, I called them out
on being misogynists,

13:10.123 --> 13:12.926
and they responded
by being absolute misogynists,

13:12.960 --> 13:16.329
so they're basically, you know,
proving my point for me.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.098
- Congratulations?
- Thank you.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.366
[email whistle]

13:20.968 --> 13:24.071
- Oh.
They know who you are?

13:24.104 --> 13:25.372
- It's fine.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.007
They'll get bored
in a couple of days

13:27.040 --> 13:28.275
and move on
to the next dumb bitch.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.143
- Sutton!
- He knows my name.

13:30.177 --> 13:33.246
- Come sort these garments.
- Go get 'em, babe.

13:39.953 --> 13:42.990
- Right here!
- Sutton, I'm leaving.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.424
I want that seating chart
by the morning,

13:44.457 --> 13:46.293
if that's possible.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.295
- You got it, boss.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.031
*

13:51.064 --> 13:52.132
- Sutton!

13:54.201 --> 13:56.069
[phone buzzes]

13:57.470 --> 13:59.539
- Ugh, damn it.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.076
- Sutton.

14:05.078 --> 14:07.047
- Coming, Oliver.

14:07.080 --> 14:10.217
- * On fire,
you gonna see me coming *

14:10.250 --> 14:12.352
*

14:12.385 --> 14:16.089
* Gettin' higher,
let's keep on moving *

14:16.123 --> 14:19.259
*

14:19.292 --> 14:22.329
- Oh! Right there.
- Darlene!

14:22.362 --> 14:24.164
- The congresswoman
is on her way to dinner,

14:24.197 --> 14:26.199
but we can take three members
of the press with us

14:26.233 --> 14:27.400
on the drive to the restaurant.

14:27.434 --> 14:28.969
- Right here.
- Oh, oh.

14:29.002 --> 14:29.970
- "New York Times."
Let's go.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.939
And "Washington Post."

14:31.972 --> 14:33.206
- Here!
- Credentials?

14:33.240 --> 14:35.142
- "Scarlet" magazine.

14:36.543 --> 14:40.047
- Okay.
"HuffPo," it's your lucky night.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.481
- Good evening, everyone.

14:41.514 --> 14:44.351
I'd love to stop and chat.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.353
You all have a great night.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.188
- Congresswoman, I would just
love to ask you about your--

14:48.221 --> 14:50.190
- Sorry.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.259
Not tonight, "Scarlet."

14:55.028 --> 14:57.397
- * Go, go, go

14:57.430 --> 14:59.532
* Go, go, go

14:59.566 --> 15:04.071
* All I do is go, go, go

15:06.673 --> 15:08.008
- Where's
the St. Laurent slip dress?

15:08.041 --> 15:09.376
That needs to be shortened.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.643
Come on, people.

15:10.677 --> 15:13.013
Get me a Kombucha and an Ativan.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.182
I love this.

15:15.215 --> 15:16.984
Beautiful.
Fine.

15:17.017 --> 15:18.318
That was in the reject pile?

15:18.351 --> 15:19.652
- Yes, but--

15:19.686 --> 15:20.954
- We don't have
the armor for it.

15:20.988 --> 15:22.922
- Wait!
What about this?

15:25.392 --> 15:27.594
- Maybe.

15:28.695 --> 15:31.098
- Sutton?
Delivery downstairs for Lauren.

15:31.131 --> 15:32.665
- Can you just leave it
at my desk?

15:32.699 --> 15:34.067
- You have to go sign for it.

15:35.202 --> 15:41.274
*

15:42.775 --> 15:44.978
- Hey.

15:45.012 --> 15:46.279
Get in before we're busted.

15:46.313 --> 15:47.347
Come on.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.749
- * I want you

15:49.782 --> 15:52.585
- [laughs]
Are you my delivery?

15:52.619 --> 15:55.188
- I am.
- * Put me in a trance too

15:55.222 --> 15:57.657
*

15:57.690 --> 15:59.192
* Maybe find something

15:59.226 --> 16:02.695
- That is...
quite a restaurant.

16:02.729 --> 16:05.332
- Do I smell breadsticks?

16:05.365 --> 16:07.734
- You do.

16:07.767 --> 16:11.004
- I stood you up and you
still brought me breadsticks?

16:11.038 --> 16:13.406
This is amazing.

16:13.440 --> 16:16.443
You're amazing.

16:16.476 --> 16:20.747
It's not Lauren who's
keeping me here late tonight.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.749
It just seemed easier

16:22.782 --> 16:25.252
than getting into
the whole thing in a text.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.220
- What whole thing?
- You're gonna think I'm crazy.

16:27.254 --> 16:29.456
Because last week,
I almost took a job in ad sales,

16:29.489 --> 16:34.094
but what I really want to do
is fashion.

16:34.127 --> 16:37.730
- I don't think that's crazy.
- [giggles] Oh!

16:37.764 --> 16:39.399
Oh, my God,
it's not crazy, is it?

16:39.432 --> 16:41.401
Why did I wait
so long to do this?

16:41.434 --> 16:44.271
And now I feel, like,
this intense time pressure.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.473
It's like my last chance
or something.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.175
- Why?
- Because I've been

16:48.208 --> 16:49.676
on Lauren's desk
for three years.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.244
I mean, I can't stay there,
it's...

16:51.278 --> 16:53.713
I'm gonna be 26 this year.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.450
What?

16:57.484 --> 16:59.786
- You have so much time
ahead of you, you do.

16:59.819 --> 17:02.355
- It doesn't feel like that.
- I know.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.357
I remember feeling that way.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.359
But you do.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.228
- I really want this.

17:08.261 --> 17:11.064
- Then you go get it

17:11.098 --> 17:13.733
and then call me after.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.335
[both laughing]

17:15.368 --> 17:17.070
- Okay.

17:19.839 --> 17:22.142
- Bye.
- Bye.

17:22.175 --> 17:24.511
Give 'em hell.

17:24.544 --> 17:31.751
*

17:43.863 --> 17:45.532
- The Congresswoman's
press secretary

17:45.565 --> 17:47.500
literally looked me up and down
and said,

17:47.534 --> 17:48.801
"Not tonight, 'Scarlet.'"

17:48.835 --> 17:50.437
Like all we write is fluff.

17:50.470 --> 17:53.173
- So degrading.
- I felt so judged.

17:53.206 --> 17:55.408
Can you pass the milk, please?

17:55.442 --> 17:58.478

17:58.511 --> 17:59.779
Kat?

17:59.812 --> 18:01.748
- Hmm?
- The milk.

18:02.582 --> 18:06.186
- Oh, yeah.
- Thanks.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.555
Whatever.
Even if we're fluff,

18:08.588 --> 18:10.423
we're fluff with a huge

18:10.457 --> 18:12.725

18:12.759 --> 18:13.726
- Lauren Park's office.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.862
I'm sorry, she's not in yet,

18:15.895 --> 18:18.231
but I'll give her the message.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.233
Thank you.

18:20.267 --> 18:22.335
- I'm sorry,
what is with the Lady Gaga?

18:22.369 --> 18:23.536
Are you gonna sing for us?

18:23.570 --> 18:24.871
- Do you love it,
or do you love it?

18:24.904 --> 18:26.573
- I love it.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.475
- It's so that I'm not
chained to Lauren's desk

18:28.508 --> 18:29.876
and also, it makes me
more available to Oliver.

18:29.909 --> 18:33.413
- Ah.
- Oh, my God.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.215
These Twitter trolls
will not stop.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.417
Look.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.220
- Oh, my God.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.489
Most of these are...
rape threats.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.557
- Yeah, I know, I wish
they'd be more imaginative.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.926
- Kat, it's not funny.
This is scary.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.895
- Oh, come on.
It's not scary.

18:48.928 --> 18:51.898
Jane, it's annoying,
it's disgusting,

18:51.931 --> 18:54.567
but it's not scary, okay?
It's just words.

18:54.601 --> 18:57.570
Anyway, I gotta go
crush this presentation,

18:57.604 --> 18:59.572
so I'll see you guys later.

18:59.606 --> 19:01.508
- Go crush it.

19:01.541 --> 19:02.542
- Count on it.

19:02.575 --> 19:09.816
*

19:11.818 --> 19:13.786
- Kat?
Ready?

19:13.820 --> 19:15.555
- Mm-hmm.

19:15.588 --> 19:18.291
- * Gettin' lost
on the wild side *

19:18.325 --> 19:21.228
* In my mind
where no one can go *

* Think I'm losing my cool, oh

19:24.964 --> 19:28.501
* Oh, oh, oh

19:28.535 --> 19:31.804
* On my way off the rails, I

19:31.838 --> 19:33.506
* Don't pretend I come...

19:33.540 --> 19:35.408
- Kat?

19:35.442 --> 19:38.811
- * How's it feel
being you, oh *

19:38.845 --> 19:40.547
* Oh, oh, oh

19:47.687 --> 19:50.890
* Our fears get magnified

19:53.560 --> 19:55.328
- Well, Kat Edison
has been with us

19:55.362 --> 19:57.630
for several years now,
and in that time

19:57.664 --> 20:01.601
she has grown our
online presence tremendously.

20:01.634 --> 20:04.637
I have always known her
to come forward with smart,

20:04.671 --> 20:08.641
cutting-edge ideas,
and today is no exception.

20:08.675 --> 20:10.510
Kat, the floor is yours.

20:10.543 --> 20:11.578
- Thank you.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.513
Ladies and gentlemen,

20:13.546 --> 20:16.983
in this uncertain time
in the magazine industry,

20:17.016 --> 20:19.519
"Scarlet" is, uh,
one of the few books

20:19.552 --> 20:21.588
that actually continues
to thrive.

20:21.621 --> 20:26.526
Our readers are
technologically savvy and...

20:26.559 --> 20:27.994
[phone vibrating]

20:28.027 --> 20:32.332
And, uh....

20:32.365 --> 20:33.600
So...

20:33.633 --> 20:37.537
So not only do we...

20:37.570 --> 20:39.972
need to continue
to stay relevant

20:40.006 --> 20:42.008
with platforms like...

20:42.041 --> 20:44.511
- Kat?
- We need to...

[email whistling]

20:45.678 --> 20:48.615
Continue to push forward,

[whistling intensifies]

21:01.394 --> 21:02.629

21:02.662 --> 21:07.467
And anticipate...
what's next.

[edgy music]

21:10.537 --> 21:13.640
*

21:13.673 --> 21:15.308
I'm sorry.

21:15.342 --> 21:18.411
I--[sniffles]
I'm not feeling well.

21:25.652 --> 21:28.755
- Kat.
Kat.

21:30.089 --> 21:31.391
What just happened in there?

21:31.424 --> 21:32.825
- I don't know.

21:32.859 --> 21:34.327
- What do you mean,
you don't know?

21:34.361 --> 21:36.763
You said that you were ready.

21:41.501 --> 21:43.603
[sighs]

21:43.636 --> 21:45.672
Okay.

21:48.841 --> 21:52.479
- I saw it
right before I walked in.

21:52.512 --> 21:54.714
I--I don't know.
I didn't know what to do.

21:54.747 --> 21:56.583
But you know that--
that's not me.

21:56.616 --> 21:57.617
I shouldn't have
walked out, okay?

21:57.650 --> 21:59.586
I know that.
It's stupid.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.354
But I can go back in now,
and I can do this--

22:01.388 --> 22:03.523
- No. No. I'm gonna
reschedule it for tomorrow.

22:03.556 --> 22:04.857
- Honestly, I'm good.
I can do this.

22:04.891 --> 22:06.593
- Kat, you need to trust me.

22:06.626 --> 22:08.027
You need to catch your breath,

22:08.060 --> 22:09.729
take an hour,
fall apart, come back,

22:09.762 --> 22:12.699
and we're gonna figure this out.

22:12.732 --> 22:14.634
We'll figure it out.

22:14.667 --> 22:18.638
[soft piano music]

22:18.671 --> 22:20.373
- You know what?

22:20.407 --> 22:22.642
I don't even care
about the picture.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.611
I--I really don't.
I'm proud of it.

22:24.644 --> 22:26.613
It's the fact
that they violated my privacy.

22:26.646 --> 22:27.880
- Maybe you should stop looking.
- Oh, jeez.

22:27.914 --> 22:29.649
- Oh, yeah, I'm a slut
because I took

22:29.682 --> 22:32.552
a topless photo of myself
in the south of France.

22:32.585 --> 22:33.886
What is wrong
with these people?

22:33.920 --> 22:35.755
- Okay, hey, look.
It's not all bad.

22:35.788 --> 22:37.624
The CEO of a VR company
tweeted at you.

22:37.657 --> 22:39.392
Emily Ramos says, "Sorry
for what you're going through.

22:39.426 --> 22:40.660
I support you
and have your back."

22:40.693 --> 22:42.061
[email whistles]
- Oh, wow.

22:42.094 --> 22:43.763
Followed immediately by someone

22:43.796 --> 22:45.698
who thinks
my boobs aren't that great.

22:46.766 --> 22:49.736
"He says
as he takes a break

22:49.769 --> 22:52.805
from masturbating
in his parents' basement."

22:52.839 --> 22:54.741
- Come on.
Don't engage.

22:54.774 --> 22:55.808
- I'm not engaging, Jane.

22:55.842 --> 22:58.545
I'm fixing this.

22:58.578 --> 23:02.148
[mellow upbeat music]

- Congressional offices.

23:17.664 --> 23:20.833
- Hi. This is Jane Sloan
from "Scarlet" magazine.

23:20.867 --> 23:22.835
- Yes?
- I would love to talk

23:22.869 --> 23:25.638
to the congresswoman
about her style.

23:25.672 --> 23:27.607
I'm doing a super fun piece.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.609
It's called
"House of Furstenberg

23:29.642 --> 23:31.444
Meets House
of Representatives."

23:31.478 --> 23:33.613
- For your magazine?
- Yes, it'll reach

23:33.646 --> 23:38.618
a lot of young, awesome,
fashionable millennial voters.

23:38.651 --> 23:39.719
Would the congresswoman
be interested

23:39.752 --> 23:41.521
in doing an interview?

23:41.554 --> 23:44.457
- Hold one moment, please.
- Yes, I'll hold.

23:44.491 --> 23:45.692
- [whispers]
What are you doing?

23:45.725 --> 23:47.960
- She shouldn't have
underestimated me.

23:47.994 --> 23:50.730
- Ms. Sloan?
- Yes.

23:50.763 --> 23:51.964
- She is available.
- She would?

23:51.998 --> 23:53.466
- Yeah, ten minutes.
- Perfect.

23:53.500 --> 23:54.667
Ten minutes is all I need.

23:54.701 --> 23:56.569
Thank you.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.772
And that's how it's done.

24:00.006 --> 24:03.610
- * Comes back around

24:03.643 --> 24:05.878
* Ooh

24:07.914 --> 24:10.517
- This is Jane Sloan
from "Scarlet" magazine.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.619
- Thank you.

24:12.652 --> 24:13.753
- Congresswoman, it's such
a pleasure to meet you.

24:13.786 --> 24:14.854
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

24:14.887 --> 24:17.490
- You have five minutes.

24:17.524 --> 24:18.758
- [softly] Okay.
[clears throat]

24:18.791 --> 24:20.527
[soft beep]

24:20.560 --> 24:21.628
- So, what would
"Scarlet" readers

24:21.661 --> 24:23.229
like to know about
how I dress?

24:23.262 --> 24:25.532
- Well,
let's start with the basics.

24:25.565 --> 24:27.500
On the campaign trail,
flats or heels?

24:27.534 --> 24:28.801
- Flats.

24:28.835 --> 24:30.537
Stylish, of course,
but when you're putting in

24:30.570 --> 24:32.238
16-hour days, comfort is key.

24:32.271 --> 24:34.741
- And do you have
a go-to power outfit?

24:34.774 --> 24:36.776
- I do not.
I think every day is different,

24:36.809 --> 24:38.878
and every outfit is important.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.547
- How so?

24:40.580 --> 24:41.681
- We all saw
what Hillary went through.

24:41.714 --> 24:43.249
The day after each debate,

24:43.282 --> 24:45.785
they scrutinized her pantsuits
more than her policy.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.654
So when I'm choosing
an outfit I'm thinking,

24:47.687 --> 24:49.556
"What do I want to communicate?

24:49.589 --> 24:52.725
How can I use fashion
to my advantage?"

24:52.759 --> 24:56.596
- I would like to ask you
about a few serious issues.

24:56.629 --> 24:59.532
For example, your vote in favor
of the Keystone Pipeline.

24:59.566 --> 25:01.934
That surprised
a lot of progressives.

25:01.968 --> 25:04.671
- That's
a "Mother Jones" question.

25:04.704 --> 25:06.806
- Our readers are just as
interested in your politics

25:06.839 --> 25:09.676
as they are in your fashion.
I know I am,

25:09.709 --> 25:12.945
and I'm so inspired
by everything you do for women.

25:12.979 --> 25:15.782
Um, but your voting record on
environmental issues--

25:15.815 --> 25:17.750
- Jane, I'm sorry, but um,

25:17.784 --> 25:19.786
we're gonna
have to cut this short.

25:19.819 --> 25:20.720
You are so sweet.

25:20.753 --> 25:23.556
It was lovely to meet you.

25:24.924 --> 25:29.261
- Uh, I-I would like to ask you
about your voting record?

25:29.295 --> 25:31.263
Thank you.

25:31.297 --> 25:35.668
*

25:35.702 --> 25:36.869

25:36.903 --> 25:39.606
- Lauren Park's office.
- Hey.

25:39.639 --> 25:40.973
- Hey, what's up?

25:41.007 --> 25:42.709
- I ran into Oliver
this morning.

25:42.742 --> 25:44.276
I asked him
about the assistant job.

25:44.310 --> 25:46.813
I couldn't help myself,
but don't worry.

25:46.846 --> 25:49.616
Kept it casual.
- Okay, and...

25:49.649 --> 25:51.050
- He's already got
a stack of resumes,

25:51.083 --> 25:52.985
so just to give you a heads-up,

25:53.019 --> 25:55.822
you might have to move
a little fast on this one.

25:55.855 --> 25:57.790
- Yeah, I figured.
- And, Sutton,

25:57.824 --> 26:00.259
he wants someone
with fashion experience.

26:00.292 --> 26:02.662
I'm not saying you shouldn't
throw your hat in the ring,

26:02.695 --> 26:04.764
just thought you should know,
that's all.

26:04.797 --> 26:06.365
[beep beep]
- Okay, thanks.

26:06.398 --> 26:07.934
I got to take this other call.

26:07.967 --> 26:10.737
Fashion Department--
uh, Lauren Park's office.

26:12.905 --> 26:15.041
- What are you doing?

26:15.074 --> 26:16.909
- I'll have to get back to you
with that information.

26:16.943 --> 26:21.013
I, uh, was just, um, uh--
'cause Oliver was wondering

26:21.047 --> 26:24.383
if you wanted to, uh,
wear one of...

26:24.416 --> 26:25.885
That's a tie.

26:25.918 --> 26:28.855
Um, I was helping Oliver.
He's shorthanded.

26:28.888 --> 26:30.657
- I'm shorthanded.

26:30.690 --> 26:32.892
My assistant never seems
to be at her desk.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.694
The seating chart you sent me--

26:34.727 --> 26:36.696
you put Tim Gunn
next to Lady Gaga.

26:36.729 --> 26:39.766
What did I tell you?
Opposite sides of the room.

26:39.799 --> 26:40.700
- I'll fix it right away.

26:40.733 --> 26:42.134
- How can you expect me

26:42.168 --> 26:43.703
to put in a good word
for you with Oliver

26:43.736 --> 26:45.938
when you're completely
neglecting my desk?

26:45.972 --> 26:48.875
I need you focused.
Is that clear?

26:48.908 --> 26:52.378
- I'm sorry, Lauren.
Focused, yes.

26:55.748 --> 26:57.884
Do you, uh--
do you want a green juice?

26:57.917 --> 26:59.118
- You know I do.

26:59.151 --> 27:01.821
[knocking]

27:02.855 --> 27:04.824
- Is this the face
that launched a thousand ships?

27:04.857 --> 27:06.859
- It is,
and I come bearing gifts.

27:06.893 --> 27:09.395
- Oh.
- Sorry I'm late.

27:09.428 --> 27:10.863
- How was the congresswoman?

27:10.897 --> 27:12.765
- [exhales]
Um...

27:12.799 --> 27:13.933
She thinks I'm sweet.

27:13.966 --> 27:16.769
- Oh, you must have loved that.

27:16.803 --> 27:18.938
- Just open the wine,
please.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.873
I mean,
she thinks I'm sweet,

27:20.907 --> 27:24.777
and I think she is
frustratingly inconsistent.

27:24.811 --> 27:26.779
She's a total champion
of women

27:26.813 --> 27:28.380
but a total enemy
of the environment.

27:28.414 --> 27:30.116
Someone needs to
press her on it.

27:30.149 --> 27:32.118
- That'd be a good story.
- It would be.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.786
But all she would
talk to me about

27:33.820 --> 27:34.721
was her choice of footwear.

27:34.754 --> 27:36.723
I had a plan.

27:36.756 --> 27:38.424
I was trying
to be sneaky and smart

27:38.457 --> 27:40.092
to get the bigger story,

27:40.126 --> 27:42.762
and now I'm gonna go
from just being a sex writer

27:42.795 --> 27:45.832
to just being
a fashion writer, so...

27:45.865 --> 27:50.770

38:12.123 --> 38:15.026
* They're the ones we can
trust in the universe *

38:15.060 --> 38:18.063
* When you're lost and you
left and it's getting worse *

38:18.096 --> 38:22.968
* They're the ones you know
will get you by *

38:23.001 --> 38:25.837
* We are all

38:25.871 --> 38:29.341
* Strange...

38:29.375 --> 38:30.976
- Lauren?

38:31.009 --> 38:32.544
Hey, you said
that we would have a chance

38:32.578 --> 38:35.080
to chat after the fundraiser.

38:35.113 --> 38:37.549
Um...

38:37.583 --> 38:40.452
maybe I went about this
the wrong way.

38:41.487 --> 38:44.556
Okay, I definitely went
about this the wrong way,

38:44.590 --> 38:48.527
but...I've worked
really hard for you,

38:48.560 --> 38:51.096
and I'm really grateful
for everything

38:51.129 --> 38:52.531
that I've learned
working at your desk

38:52.564 --> 38:54.366
over the past three years...

38:55.567 --> 38:58.537
But it's time for me
to move on,

38:58.570 --> 39:00.572
and I'm gonna go for this job
in the fashion department

39:00.606 --> 39:03.442
with or without your support.

39:03.475 --> 39:05.411
But I realize
that it's a long shot,

39:05.444 --> 39:09.415
so...I would be really
grateful

39:09.448 --> 39:12.484
to have a solid
recommendation from you.

39:15.921 --> 39:18.690
- Okay.
- Really?

39:19.925 --> 39:22.461
- Let's figure out
how to get you that job.

39:24.496 --> 39:27.132
You can sit.
- Okay.

39:27.165 --> 39:30.135
[upbeat melody continues]

39:30.168 --> 39:35.507

39:35.541 --> 39:38.510
[woman vocalizing]

39:38.544 --> 39:45.617
*

39:59.531 --> 40:00.966
- * Hey

40:00.999 --> 40:04.069
* Anyone can get paid

40:04.102 --> 40:06.905
* Anyone can get saved

40:06.938 --> 40:09.441
* Every day, I still walk

40:09.475 --> 40:12.744
* Into the world

40:12.778 --> 40:15.747
* The only thing I can see

40:15.781 --> 40:18.750
* The only real guarantee

40:18.784 --> 40:21.219
*

40:21.252 --> 40:23.489
* Ain't smiling

40:23.522 --> 40:27.025
* They're the ones make
the choice in the universe *

40:27.058 --> 40:29.761
* When I'm lost and I'm left
and it's getting worse *

40:29.795 --> 40:34.766
* They're the ones
who I know will get me by *

40:34.800 --> 40:41.206
* We are all strange

40:41.239 --> 40:44.576
- Hey.
- Hi.

40:45.811 --> 40:48.013
- Third time's the charm?

40:50.682 --> 40:53.485
- "Ask a hundred different women
why they fake their orgasms,

40:53.519 --> 40:56.054
"and you're likely to get
a hundred different answers,

40:56.087 --> 40:58.156
"but here's the thing.
It's not the lie that matters.

40:58.189 --> 41:01.493
"It's that women feel
that they have to.

41:01.527 --> 41:03.962
"And gentlemen, that's on us.

41:03.995 --> 41:06.097
So let's talk about it."

41:06.131 --> 41:10.168
- Oh, don't stop now.
I love hearing my own work.

41:11.570 --> 41:14.573
- So are you gonna
invite me in?

41:14.606 --> 41:21.680
