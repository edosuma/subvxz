WEBVTT

00:01.748 --> 00:06.969
(Archer moaning deliriously)
LANA: Archer.

00:06.971 --> 00:08.971
ARCHER: Lana?
(Lana yelps)

00:08.973 --> 00:11.898
Lana!
LANA: Whoa, Jesus Christ!

00:12.018 --> 00:14.435
Chill out, Miggs!
ARCHER: I'm sorry, it's just

00:14.437 --> 00:16.437
been so long.
LANA: Okay, it's been...

00:16.439 --> 00:17.669
ARCHER: Oh, my God.
You're pregnant again?!

00:17.789 --> 00:19.555
LANA: What?
ARCHER: How long have I been

00:19.675 --> 00:23.861
down here, left to rot in this
godforsaken hole?!

00:23.863 --> 00:28.032
LANA: Like... three weeks.
ARCHER: Hmm, seems so much

00:28.034 --> 00:30.034
longer than that.
LANA: It...

00:30.036 --> 00:32.537
ARCHER: So, please tell me
that's an entire <i>canard à la</i>

00:32.539 --> 00:34.989
<i>presse</i> with a file in it.
LANA: Half a chicken, no

00:34.991 --> 00:37.071
file, just that weird
quasi-cornbread they have here.

00:37.076 --> 00:38.846
ARCHER: Ugh, why do you even
bother?

00:38.944 --> 00:41.311
LANA: That's weird, I was
asking myself the same thing on

00:41.313 --> 00:43.396
the way down here.
ARCHER: And then brought

00:43.398 --> 00:45.949
crappy food anyway?
LANA: And then left?

00:45.951 --> 00:47.984
ARCHER: No, no, no, wait,
come on, Lana, I-I'm sorry, but

00:47.986 --> 00:49.685
I-I'm starting to lose it down
here.

00:49.687 --> 00:51.354
You-you got to make him let
me go!

00:51.356 --> 00:53.356
LANA: Make him how?
ARCHER: Well, I hate to

00:53.358 --> 00:55.358
even ask, but...
LANA: Blow him?

00:55.360 --> 00:57.360
ARCHER: Your words.
LANA: And then what, Archer,

00:57.362 --> 00:59.362
you want me to blow the whole
army?

00:59.364 --> 01:01.297
ARCHER: How is there still
an army?

01:01.299 --> 01:03.716
How have the rebels not wiped
them out already?

01:03.718 --> 01:05.969
LANA: Because turns out,
he's actually very good at

01:05.971 --> 01:08.588
commanding an army.
CYRIL: And as Third and

01:08.590 --> 01:11.758
Fourth Battalion withdraw, here
comes First Armored, and now the

01:11.760 --> 01:14.844
rebels are outflanked.
COMANDANTE (laughs): Sir,

01:14.846 --> 01:17.263
it's brilliant!
CYRIL: A classic pincher

01:17.265 --> 01:19.265
movement.
Just like Hannibal at the battle

01:19.267 --> 01:21.768
of Cannae.
And also Keith, in my

01:21.770 --> 01:24.270
Warhammer guild.
LANA: So, get used to that

01:24.272 --> 01:26.773
weird cornbread, 'cause you
might be down here a...

01:26.775 --> 01:30.076
ARCHER: Lana, I need a
woman's touch!

01:30.078 --> 01:33.062
(Lana grunts)
Oh! Ow!

01:33.064 --> 01:35.665
I'm sorry, Lana.
I said a woman, not a

01:35.667 --> 01:38.901
stevedore who lost his hand
in a stevedoring accident

01:38.903 --> 01:42.405
and then got a hand transplant
from an actual bear.

01:42.407 --> 01:44.757
LANA: So, did you want to
just do it right through the

01:44.759 --> 01:48.761
bars or...?
ARCHER: I mean, we do.

01:48.763 --> 01:52.465
And sometimes they do.
CALDÉRON: Hello.

01:52.467 --> 01:54.934
LANA: I... wait.
So, in three weeks, you go from

01:54.936 --> 01:58.021
you're gonna execute Archer
to now you guys are, like,

01:58.023 --> 02:00.056
swinger pals?
CALDÉRON: Well, I wouldn't

02:00.058 --> 02:02.692
say "pals."
ARCHER: Wow, not what you

02:02.694 --> 02:04.694
said yesterday.
CALDÉRON: Oh, come on, that

02:04.696 --> 02:07.280
was the pruno talking.
LANA: Well, I hate to break

02:07.282 --> 02:09.949
up this delightful ménage, but
Presidente Cyril wants her back

02:09.951 --> 02:12.201
upstairs.
ARCHER: Wait, what?

02:12.203 --> 02:14.287
CALDÉRON: What?
JULIANA: Why.

02:14.289 --> 02:16.456
LANA: Guess.
JULIANA: Ah.

02:16.458 --> 02:18.908
LANA: Mm.
CALDÉRON: Ow!

02:18.910 --> 02:20.910
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

02:20.912 --> 02:23.830
BOTH: What?
CALDÉRON: Archer, do you want

02:23.832 --> 02:26.867
me to move over one?
ARCHER: Eh.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.074

03:06.994 --> 03:11.631
CYRIL: Ah, Madame First Lady.
So good of you to join me.

03:11.871 --> 03:13.871
JULIANA: It's not as if I
had a choice.

03:13.873 --> 03:15.873
CYRIL: Well...
JULIANA: Nor am I still the

03:15.875 --> 03:17.355
the first lady.
CYRIL: Well, maybe not

03:17.440 --> 03:19.681
technically, since your husband
divorced you and then was

03:19.699 --> 03:23.631
immediately deposed by me, but
the situation is, as they say,

03:23.633 --> 03:25.344
fluid.
LANA: Ugh.

03:25.464 --> 03:27.962
I brought her, can I go now?
CYRIL: Yes, for the love of

03:28.082 --> 03:30.671
God, get out.
LANA: I meant home.

03:30.673 --> 03:32.673
PAM (laughing): What are you,
nuts?

03:32.675 --> 03:35.059
Cap'n Crunch here just
took all the coca fields back

03:35.061 --> 03:37.061
from the rebels.
We're sitting on an endless

03:37.063 --> 03:39.063
supply.
LANA: Of what, coca leaf

03:39.065 --> 03:41.366
smoothies?
(rhythmic gulping)

03:41.368 --> 03:43.618
Oh, my God.
That's a coca leaf smoothie.

03:43.620 --> 03:46.020
CHERLENE: And they're gross.
It basically tastes like a fart

03:46.022 --> 03:48.990
of itself, but it's better than
the cocaine donuts and whipped

03:48.992 --> 03:50.992
cocaine she was eating.
(Pam burps)

03:50.994 --> 03:53.127
PAM: 'Cause that's just empty
calories.

03:53.129 --> 03:55.163
LANA: Well, and cocaine.
PAM: Which, if I'm being

03:55.165 --> 03:58.049
totally honest, I maybe might
have a problem with.

03:58.051 --> 04:00.501
LANA: No.
CYRIL: And, Lana, the rebels

04:00.503 --> 04:02.587
still control the airport.
It's their HQ.

04:02.589 --> 04:05.039
So, unless you want to walk, you
can't go home.

04:05.041 --> 04:07.041
MALORY: And why on Earth
would you want to?

04:07.043 --> 04:09.043
(Lana sighs)
CYRIL: Uh...

04:09.045 --> 04:11.045
MALORY: Why bother going
back?

04:11.047 --> 04:13.047
The U.S. government stole your
livelihood, forced you to become

04:13.049 --> 04:16.567
a criminal.
And I hate to say it, but it's

04:16.569 --> 04:19.053
not like you have a man waiting
for you.

04:19.055 --> 04:21.488
LANA: I... You know...
MALORY: Whereas here we have

04:21.491 --> 04:24.325
everything we need.
It's like San Marcos has been

04:24.327 --> 04:27.278
waiting thousands of years for
us to arrive.

04:27.280 --> 04:29.497
Lana, this could be our...
LANA: Don't.

04:29.499 --> 04:31.499
MALORY: Zion, yes, there, I
said it.

04:31.501 --> 04:33.501
(Pam burps)
PAM: Wait, they got weed

04:33.503 --> 04:35.503
here, too?
LANA: That's not what the

04:35.505 --> 04:37.505
song's about!
CHERLENE: Told you.

04:37.507 --> 04:39.540
LANA: But I just this second
realized why you want to stay

04:39.542 --> 04:42.260
down here.
Cyril's just the Vader to your

04:42.262 --> 04:45.129
Palpatine.
MALORY: Is that a reference

04:45.131 --> 04:47.415
I should get, or...?
LANA: Seriously?

04:47.417 --> 04:49.750
MALORY: Well, I'm sorry,
Lana, I didn't go to rabbinical

04:49.752 --> 04:52.220
school.
LANA: It's from... No, you

04:52.222 --> 04:54.472
know what? Never mind.
But, spoiler alert, Vader ends

04:54.474 --> 04:56.474
up killing Palpatine.
CYRIL: Hey.

04:56.476 --> 04:58.526
CHERLENE: But only for three
days, right?

04:58.528 --> 05:00.528
And then he moves the rock and
comes out of his cave stronger

05:00.530 --> 05:02.530
than ever.
PAM: Then he shuts off the

05:02.532 --> 05:04.532
tractor beam, releasing the Jews
from captivity.

05:04.534 --> 05:06.534
LANA: What?
CYRIL: Hey.

05:06.536 --> 05:08.536
MALORY: Wait, yes, now that
sounds familiar.

05:08.538 --> 05:11.439
LANA: It cannot possibly.
MALORY: Gospel of Luke?

05:11.441 --> 05:13.441
CYRIL: Hey.
LANA: Oh for... Ray, you used

05:13.443 --> 05:15.443
to be a preacher, you want to
back me up here?

05:15.445 --> 05:17.445
RAY: I actually don't know.
My church didn't really do the

05:17.447 --> 05:19.780
New Testament.
LANA: The one with Jesus

05:19.782 --> 05:22.383
Christ in it.
RAY: I mean, I take your

05:22.385 --> 05:24.585
word for it, but...
CYRIL: Hey!

05:24.587 --> 05:26.637
Will you idiots get out?!
I'm trying to talk to the first

05:26.639 --> 05:28.639
lady!
CHERLENE: Of what, this

05:28.641 --> 05:31.625
country or country music?
'Cause I'm first lady of both!

05:31.627 --> 05:35.063
CYRIL No, you're not...
CHERLENE: Outlaw country!

05:35.065 --> 05:38.299
(jail door bangs shut)
(Cherlene sighs)

05:38.301 --> 05:40.234
CALDÉRON: Oh, my God, my
beautiful and also

05:40.236 --> 05:43.104
multi-talented wife!
You are here!

05:43.106 --> 05:45.573
CHERLENE: I know, right?
It's like, finally.

05:45.575 --> 05:47.692
ARCHER: As in...
this is a good thing?

05:47.694 --> 05:49.360
(plays random notes)
CHERLENE: Duh!

05:49.362 --> 05:52.280
I'm finally gonna get the outlaw
country cred I deserve.

05:52.282 --> 05:54.499
CALDÉRON: Oh, my God, you've
always deserved it.

05:54.501 --> 05:56.501
ARCHER: Wait, how does being
in jail...?

05:56.503 --> 05:59.036
CHERLENE: Paging Dr. Black,
Dr. Man In Black!

05:59.038 --> 06:02.090
Johnny Cash was in Folsom Prison
and San Quentin, so...

06:02.092 --> 06:05.326
ARCHER: Yeah, to visit.
CHERLENE: Hmm?

06:05.328 --> 06:07.345
ARCHER: He just played for
the prisoners, dummy.

06:07.347 --> 06:11.516
He wasn't actually in prison.
(plays "womp womp")

06:11.518 --> 06:13.518
But don't worry.
We're gonna get out of here and

06:13.520 --> 06:16.170
go join the rebels.
CALDÉRON: Yes, then you and

06:16.172 --> 06:19.190
I, my beautiful wife, will live
a simple life in the hills,

06:19.192 --> 06:22.276
scratching shit food, like yams,
out of the ground with a, uh,

06:22.278 --> 06:25.062
yam-scratcher.
CHERLENE: Okay, A-- start

06:25.064 --> 06:27.181
counting backwards from a
million years, and when you get

06:27.183 --> 06:29.683
to zero that still won't happen.

06:29.685 --> 06:32.787
CALDÉRON: Aw.
CHERLENE: And B-- how...

06:32.789 --> 06:35.790
how do we get out of here?
ARCHER: Well, we're, uh,

06:35.792 --> 06:38.459
still fine-tuning it, but...
CALDÉRON: We have no plan,

06:38.461 --> 06:40.495
whatsoever.
CHERLENE: Okay, good, because

06:40.497 --> 06:43.697
I didn't want to step on
anybody's toes, but byoink.

06:43.699 --> 06:45.699
CALDÉRON: Whaaaaat?
ARCHER: Where did you get

06:45.701 --> 06:47.868
that?
CHERLENE: Let's just say,

06:47.870 --> 06:50.338
"I honestly don't know."
ARCHER: Fair enough.

06:50.340 --> 06:52.473
CHERLENE: Cyril says the
rebel headquarters are...

06:52.475 --> 06:56.310
Wait, is it "are" or is it "is"?
ARCHER: It's "where," idiot!

06:56.312 --> 06:58.346
CHERLENE: The airport!
Jesus!

06:58.348 --> 07:00.731
CALDÉRON: And you, sir, will
keep a civil tongue in your head

07:00.733 --> 07:02.733
when you are addressing
the First Lady of the

07:02.735 --> 07:05.436
government-in-exile of La
República de San Marcos!

07:05.438 --> 07:07.221
CHERLENE: And also country
music.

07:07.223 --> 07:10.074
ARCHER: I facetiously beg
milady's pardon.

07:10.076 --> 07:12.827
CHERLENE: Oh, milady
facetiously grants it.

07:12.829 --> 07:15.446
ARCHER: Oh, goody.
Now let's steal a car, go join

07:15.448 --> 07:18.282
the rebels, then come back here
and crush Cyril's stupid army.

07:18.284 --> 07:20.284
CALDÉRON: You make it sound
so easy.

07:20.286 --> 07:21.869
ARCHER (chuckling): Well,
it's Cyril.

07:21.871 --> 07:24.572
I mean, unless he's got a
nuclear warhead in his pants...

07:24.574 --> 07:27.208
CHERLENE: Which he totally
does.

07:27.210 --> 07:30.511
KRIEGER: Which, guys, can we
talk about this?

07:30.513 --> 07:33.045
KRIEGER CLONE 1: The time for
talk is kaput, <i>Klon-Bruder.</i>

07:33.165 --> 07:36.781
<i>Now is the time for action!</i>
<i>KRIEGER CLONE 2: Clone bone!</i>

07:37.500 --> 07:41.439
<i>CHERLENE: And by that I mean</i>
<i>his... you know...</i>

07:41.441 --> 07:44.442
<i>ARCHER: Yeah, we...</i>
<i>CHERLENE: Let me finish!</i>

07:44.444 --> 07:46.811
<i>...penis.</i>
<i>No, you ruined it.</i>

07:46.813 --> 07:51.282
<i>And by "it," I meant the moment.</i>
<i>Not his penis.</i>

07:51.284 --> 07:52.538
<i>ARCHER: I...</i>
<i>CHERLENE: Penis.</i>

07:56.158 --> 07:58.574
ARCHER: Will you shut up?!
I know what I'm doing!

07:58.814 --> 08:01.197
CALDÉRON: Yes, but don't do
what you are doing!

08:01.199 --> 08:04.400
(Caldéron and Cherlene yelp)
(Archer chuckles)

08:04.402 --> 08:06.903
CALDÉRON: Are you crazy?!
This car is worth one quarter of

08:06.905 --> 08:08.788
$1 million!
CHERLENE: Well, <i>was.</i>

08:08.790 --> 08:10.490
<i>ARCHER: And did you ever</i>
<i>think maybe your fleet of</i>

08:10.492 --> 08:13.126
<i>priceless cars is the reason</i>
<i>you're fighting off a</i>

08:13.128 --> 08:15.078
<i>rebellion?</i>
<i>CALDÉRON: I'm fighting the</i>

08:15.080 --> 08:16.996
<i>rebels because that is what we</i>
<i>do!</i>

08:16.998 --> 08:19.082
<i>My father fought the rebels, his</i>
<i>father fought the rebels...</i>

08:19.084 --> 08:21.000
<i>CHERLENE: So, like a family</i>
<i>business.</i>

08:21.002 --> 08:23.002
<i>ARCHER: That manufactures</i>
<i>oppression.</i>

08:23.004 --> 08:24.871
<i>CALDÉRON: Well, and cocaine.</i>
<i>In fact...</i>

08:24.873 --> 08:28.141
<i>CHERLENE: Stop!</i>
<i>(Archer and Caldéron scream)</i>

08:28.143 --> 08:30.760
<i>(tires screeching)</i>
<i>ARCHER: What?!</i>

08:30.762 --> 08:32.761
<i>CHERLENE: That.</i>
<i>(Archer gasps)</i>

08:32.764 --> 08:35.181
<i>I mean, if you think we have</i>
<i>time.</i>

08:35.183 --> 08:37.383
<i>(tiger roars)</i>
<i>ARCHER: I... Is there a</i>

08:37.385 --> 08:39.235
<i>tiger?</i>
<i>CALDÉRON: Of course there is</i>

08:39.236 --> 08:40.986
<i>a tiger.</i>
<i>Where did you think you are,</i>

08:40.989 --> 08:44.390
<i>Tegucigalpa?</i>
<i>(Archer giggles gleefully)</i>

08:44.392 --> 08:47.494
<i>(tires squealing)</i>
<i>CYRIL: And so, by the power</i>

08:47.496 --> 08:51.998
<i>self-vested in me, I now</i>
<i>pronounce us man and wife, and I</i>

08:52.000 --> 08:56.402
<i>may also kiss the bride.</i>
<i>(Cyril kissing, Juliana grunts)</i>

08:56.404 --> 09:00.456
<i>PAM: Yay!</i>
<i>MALORY: Ugh, second worst</i>

09:00.458 --> 09:02.408
<i>wedding ever.</i>
<i>RAY: Yeah, but at least</i>

09:02.410 --> 09:05.077
<i>nobody died.</i>

09:09.083 --> 09:11.551
<i>PAM: I'm trying to make that</i>

09:11.553 --> 09:15.772
<i>"Damn, dawg, that's inappropes!"</i>
<i>Plus, I think I'm addicted to</i>

09:15.774 --> 09:17.857

<i>With any luck at all, it will</i>

<i>PAM: Yay!</i>

<i>Yay!</i>

<i>(tiger roars)</i>
<i>They should've sent a poet.</i>

09:37.045 --> 09:40.079

<i>Do we have any meat?</i>

<i>CALDÉRON: Literally tons.</i>

09:42.384 --> 09:44.584
<i>ARCHER: No, I didn't mean</i>

09:44.586 --> 09:47.303
<i>I meant like a steak, or some...</i>
<i>CALDÉRON: Typical American.</i>

09:47.305 --> 09:49.622
<i>You think meat comes from the</i>

09:49.624 --> 09:52.058
nice plastic wrap.
ARCHER: Yeah, you're

09:52.060 --> 09:53.593
describing meat.
CALDÉRON: No, no, no.

09:53.595 --> 09:56.095
Meat is blood and bones and
sinew!

09:56.097 --> 09:58.297
ARCHER: Well, now you're
describing not-meat.

09:58.299 --> 10:01.017
CALDÉRON: Meat is whatever
the tiger says is meat, because

10:01.019 --> 10:04.904
God made him the boss and all
the other animals his food!

10:04.906 --> 10:07.991

10:07.993 --> 10:11.194
And thank you, George Bore-well,
for that clunky analogy in

10:11.196 --> 10:14.247
defense of totalitarianism, but
I'm not feeding Shane an

10:14.249 --> 10:16.249

10:16.251 --> 10:18.918
(gasps)
Oh, my God, he's totally a

10:18.920 --> 10:21.487
Shane.
So let me bounce this off you

10:21.489 --> 10:24.290

KRIEGER: What say we don't

10:24.292 --> 10:26.960

missile at, uh...

10:26.962 --> 10:29.429

launching it?

10:29.431 --> 10:31.330

like to know?

10:31.332 --> 10:33.716
(hearty laughter)
KRIEGER: I would, actually.

10:33.718 --> 10:36.603

a little... insane.

10:36.605 --> 10:38.605
KRIEGER CLONE 1: Do you know
what's insane?!

10:38.607 --> 10:41.524
KRIEGER: Yeah, this.
All of it, everything.

10:41.526 --> 10:43.726
The rocket, uh... I'm not really
comfortable with the

10:43.728 --> 10:45.612
clone-bone.
KRIEGER CLONE 1: You're not

10:45.614 --> 10:47.363
doing it right.
Now move, so I can begin the

10:47.365 --> 10:50.683

KRIEGER: Over my dead...

10:50.685 --> 10:52.535

huh?

10:52.537 --> 10:54.904

As amazing as it would be,

10:57.375 --> 10:59.909

CHERLENE: Yeah, we can,

ARCHER: Carol, listen to me
very closely.

11:10.005 --> 11:12.055
CHERLENE: Why, you gonna walk
me through your organic method

11:12.057 --> 11:14.307
of vaginal hygiene?
ARCHER: My what?

11:14.309 --> 11:16.392
CHERLENE: You're a bigger
pussy than Shane!

11:16.394 --> 11:20.480
Come here, boy! (smacking lips)
(tiger roars, Caldéron screams)

11:20.482 --> 11:23.316

11:57.418 --> 12:01.020

guessed that was gonna happen.

(chuckling)
ARCHER: W... we should've?

12:48.103 --> 12:50.737
CHERLENE: Well, or at least
could've.

12:50.739 --> 12:53.489
I mean...
ARCHER: Yeah, I-I-I guess,

12:53.491 --> 12:56.659
uh... I guess a leopard can't
change his spots.

12:56.661 --> 13:00.163
CHERLENE: Uh... I don't know
that much about leopards.

13:00.165 --> 13:03.449
ARCHER: That was actually
a proverb.

13:03.451 --> 13:07.703
CHERLENE: That was actually a
tiger.

13:13.284 --> 13:15.451
KRIEGER: Huh.
That is a lot longer than I

13:15.453 --> 13:17.953
thought it would be.

13:22.696 --> 13:24.944
ARCHER: Okay, when we get to
rebel HQ, they might be

13:24.946 --> 13:26.979
aggressive at first, but...
CHERLENE: They wouldn't if we

13:26.981 --> 13:29.148
had a damn tiger.
(Archer sighs)

13:29.150 --> 13:32.117
ARCHER: No.
We're-we're not going back.

13:32.119 --> 13:35.371
Unless...
No.

13:35.373 --> 13:37.907
CHERLENE: What if...
ARCHER: He had his chance!

13:37.909 --> 13:39.909
JULIANA: A what?
CYRIL: A charivari.

13:39.911 --> 13:42.077
Also called a shivaree?
You know, it's that thing where

13:42.079 --> 13:44.496
everybody bangs pots and pans
outside our room as we...

13:44.498 --> 13:46.615
consummate.

13:46.617 --> 13:49.051

We're not doing that.

Ow!

13:50.955 --> 13:53.172

me.

hand... lead away.

COMANDANTE: No.

14:02.099 --> 14:03.983

PAM: Screw you guys.

14:03.985 --> 14:05.935
Hey, Krieger!
KRIEGER: What the hell is

14:05.937 --> 14:07.469
going on?
PAM: Cyril's the new

14:07.471 --> 14:09.188
dictator...
CYRIL: President.

14:09.190 --> 14:11.073
PAM: Shut up, and he just
married crazy tits, and I need

14:11.075 --> 14:12.441
a dance partner.
KRIEGER: Wh...?

14:12.443 --> 14:14.276
So nobody noticed that I've
been missing for three weeks?

14:14.278 --> 14:15.477
RAY: Um...
CYRIL: No.

14:15.479 --> 14:17.079
MALORY: Well, I certainly
didn't.

14:17.081 --> 14:18.497
PAM: We figured the vampires
ate you.

MALORY: The what?
LANA: Wait, what?

14:19.984 --> 14:22.534
KRIEGER (sighs): They're not
vampires, they're my clones.

14:22.536 --> 14:26.088
Or I'm their clone, or...
MALORY: Oh, please, you and

14:26.090 --> 14:28.507
your clone nonsense, it's all
a bunch of...

14:28.509 --> 14:31.961
LANA: Holy shit.
CYRIL: Why was I not informed

14:31.963 --> 14:35.130
of this, Krieger?
PAM: If he even is Krieger!

14:35.132 --> 14:36.498
CYRIL: Huh?
RAY: What?

14:36.500 --> 14:38.434
PAM: The real Krieger could
be down there!

14:38.436 --> 14:40.185
KRIEGER: Oh, for... that is
just...

14:40.187 --> 14:42.137
I won't even dignify that with
a response.

14:42.139 --> 14:45.608
Uh, uh... (snapping fingers)
LANA: Pam?

14:45.610 --> 14:47.342
KRIEGER: Pam!
PAM: Uh-huh.

14:47.344 --> 14:49.228
KRIEGER: I've got a
concussion.

14:49.230 --> 14:51.680
And this regular tie means
nothing, I don't like bow ties

14:51.682 --> 14:53.649
so I switched.
LANA: Well, you certainly

14:53.651 --> 14:55.367
sound concussed.
PAM: He sounds like a

14:55.369 --> 14:57.185
vampire!
I say we tie him up and let the

14:57.187 --> 14:59.187
sun sort it out!
LANA: You need to hush.

CYRIL: Tell me that robot's
not talking about launching this

15:05.329 --> 15:07.413
rocket, Krieger.
PAM: Or should we say

15:07.415 --> 15:09.331
Count Krieg...
Ow! Ow!

15:09.333 --> 15:12.918
Ow, cut it out! Ow!
Goddamn it! Ow!

15:12.920 --> 15:14.970
LANA: Thank you.
PAM: Vampire lovers.

15:14.972 --> 15:17.039
KRIEGER: Yeah, so, here's
the thing...

15:17.041 --> 15:19.008
ARCHER: This is it, rebel

<i>CYRIL: Both, either, all.</i>
<i>They'd shoot me on sight, Lana.</i>

17:49.794 --> 17:52.578
<i>And if you want Archer so damn</i>
<i>bad, you can go get him your...</i>

17:52.580 --> 17:55.080
<i>(tires squealing)</i>

17:55.082 --> 17:59.718
<i>Huh.</i>
<i>I didn't think she'd actually</i>

17:59.720 --> 18:01.703
<i>do it.</i>
<i>MALORY: Then you're an idiot.</i>

18:01.705 --> 18:06.809
<i>CYRIL: Oh, I'm the idiot?</i>
<i>MALORY: Yes.</i>

18:06.811 --> 18:08.710
<i>(Archer grunts)</i>
<i>ARCHER: What the...?</i>

18:08.712 --> 18:10.712
<i>Holly?</i>
<i>HOLLY: Archer?</i>

18:10.714 --> 18:12.731
<i>SLATER: Rando?</i>
<i>ARCHER: Slater?</i>

18:12.733 --> 18:14.850
<i>HOLLY: Who the hell is Rando?</i>
<i>SLATER: Him!</i>

18:14.852 --> 18:16.602
<i>HOLLY: That's Sterling</i>
<i>Archer!</i>

18:16.604 --> 18:19.655
<i>CHERLENE (loudly): A-hem!</i>
<i>And I am Cherlene?</i>

18:19.657 --> 18:23.725
<i>The Queen of Outlaw Country?</i>
<i>SLATER: What the hell are you</i>

18:23.727 --> 18:25.727
<i>doing here?</i>
<i>ARCHER: What the hell are you</i>

18:25.729 --> 18:27.496
<i>doing here?</i>
<i>HOLLY: I could ask you the</i>

18:27.498 --> 18:29.448
<i>same question.</i>
<i>I am</i> asking you the same

18:29.450 --> 18:31.233
question!
ARCHER: We came to join the

18:31.235 --> 18:32.751
rebels.
SLATER: What?

18:32.753 --> 18:34.837
ARCHER: What's the FBI doing
in San Marcos?

18:34.839 --> 18:37.422
With a cocaine smuggler?
(Holly sighs)

18:37.424 --> 18:39.875
HOLLY: I'm not FBI, and he's
not a...

18:39.877 --> 18:42.127
SLATER: Well, technically,
I am, but...

18:42.129 --> 18:44.429
HOLLY: We're both CIA.
ARCHER: What?!

18:44.431 --> 18:47.182
CHERLENE (whispering): C...
I... A.

18:47.184 --> 18:49.201
SLATER: And we're also
the rebels.

18:49.321 --> 18:52.024
HOLLY: And you are in a <i> mundo</i>
of <i> caca.</i>

18:52.144 --> 18:54.851
LANA: Okay!
Listen, stop, listen to me!

18:55.670 --> 18:57.318
ARCHER: Lana?!
LANA: Holly?

18:57.438 --> 18:58.838
LANA: Holly?
What's the FBI doing...

18:58.863 --> 19:01.776
ARCHER: These dickheads
aren't FBI, Lana, they're CIA!

19:01.896 --> 19:04.192
And also the rebels!

19:07.413 --> 19:10.689
Huh. Thought that would
get more of a reaction.

19:10.809 --> 19:14.741
LANA: Yeah, no, that is,
um... news, uh...

19:14.861 --> 19:17.770
but my water just broke, so...
