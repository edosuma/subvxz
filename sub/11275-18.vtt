        Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

00:05.002 --> 00:07.637
No, no, it's                    
a well-documented fact          

00:07.672 --> 00:09.272
that the female                 
of the species                  

00:09.306 --> 00:11.575
     is irresistibly drawn      
    to men in uniform.          

00:11.609 --> 00:14.093
Yeah, just yesterday,           
some lonely,                    
frustrated housewife            

00:14.128 --> 00:15.962
saw me coming                   
up the garden path,             

00:15.996 --> 00:17.347
    you know, peeking           
      through the window,       

00:17.381 --> 00:19.416
         and she tries          
     to coyly titillate me      

00:19.450 --> 00:20.950
by pulling down the shade       

00:20.984 --> 00:22.352
      so I wonder what's        
      going on behind it.       

00:22.386 --> 00:24.587
                Let me dispel   
                the mystery.    

00:24.621 --> 00:25.805
                 She was puking.

00:25.839 --> 00:27.290
        Carla,                  

00:27.324 --> 00:29.659
             don't you get bored
             just hanging around
             here all day       

00:29.693 --> 00:31.494
              waiting to take   
              cheap shots at me?

00:31.528 --> 00:33.562
  Yeah, I should get a beeper.  

00:34.615 --> 00:36.316
                All right, look.
                That's it.      

00:36.350 --> 00:37.700
                    I am sick   
                    and tired   

00:37.734 --> 00:38.851
  of being your whipping boy.   

00:38.886 --> 00:40.486
     Today the worm turns.      

00:40.520 --> 00:42.088
 You are not going to insult me 
          any longer,           

00:42.123 --> 00:44.190
    because I am not going      
    to give you the chance.     

00:44.225 --> 00:44.924
     As of from right now,      

00:44.958 --> 00:46.610
    I am shutting up,           
        zipping my lip.

                    You know    
                    something,  
                    chaps,      

02:06.706 --> 02:10.076
            I had a particularly
            fascinating session 
            this morning.       

02:13.296 --> 02:14.630
                No, honestly.   

02:18.903 --> 02:20.470
            Someone I was seeing
            for the first time. 

02:20.504 --> 02:22.939
      Extraordinarily beautiful,
      young woman,              

02:22.973 --> 02:24.741
                who's uh, rather
                unique malaise  

02:24.775 --> 02:28.594
        is to be aroused        
        with sexual frenzy by...

02:28.628 --> 02:29.946
                  Oh, good Lord.

02:29.980 --> 02:32.148
            Excuse me.          
            I don't really think

02:32.182 --> 02:34.266
          I should be discussing
          my patients here.     

02:38.989 --> 02:41.657
        Uh... how about         

02:41.692 --> 02:44.327
                 discussing them
                 over here?     

02:44.361 --> 02:45.361
Well,                           

02:45.395 --> 02:46.679
 I suppose it wouldn't violate  

02:46.713 --> 02:48.480
    any doctor-patient          
        confidentiality         

02:48.515 --> 02:50.149
     if I don't use names.      

02:50.184 --> 02:52.118
Pour the beer, Woody.           

02:52.152 --> 02:54.420
         I thought you weren't  
         going to use any names,
         Dr. Crane.             

02:54.455 --> 02:55.488
        Woody...                

02:55.523 --> 02:58.507
    Well, it seems this woman   

02:58.542 --> 03:01.410
    has her passions inflamed   
    by men who dance.           

03:01.445 --> 03:02.828
         Wait a minute,         
         Wait a minute.         

03:02.863 --> 03:04.263
                  Men who dance?

03:04.298 --> 03:05.664
         That's weird.          

03:05.699 --> 03:06.950
    What's even more bizarre,   

03:06.984 --> 03:09.619
    is that she will catapult   
    herself compulsively        

03:09.653 --> 03:13.690
        into the arms of any man
        in tights or tap shoes. 

03:13.724 --> 03:15.324
        Fascinating fixation.   

03:15.358 --> 03:16.508
                    Huh.        

03:16.543 --> 03:19.345
             Ooh, geez. I've got
             to go. I'm sorry.  

03:19.379 --> 03:20.263
                Where you going?

03:20.297 --> 03:22.615
        My ballet class.        

03:22.649 --> 03:24.216
            No, no,             

03:24.250 --> 03:25.034
         lunch, lunch.          

03:25.069 --> 03:26.452
That was a little psychological 
             humor.             

03:26.487 --> 03:28.237
You know, as my old             
professor used to say,          

03:28.271 --> 03:29.773
    if you can't laugh          
    at your patients,           

03:29.807 --> 03:31.040
    what fun are they?          

03:32.909 --> 03:34.127
        See you later.          

03:34.161 --> 03:35.161
            Norm.               

03:35.196 --> 03:36.462
Morning, everybody.             

03:36.496 --> 03:38.097
            PATRONS:            
             Norm!              

03:38.132 --> 03:41.016
         WOODY:                 
         Can I pour you a draft,
         Mr. Peterson?          

03:41.051 --> 03:42.318
                A little early, 
                isn't it, Woody?

03:42.352 --> 03:43.702
          For a beer?           

03:43.737 --> 03:45.721
    No, for stupid questions.   

03:45.756 --> 03:47.857
                        Pour.   

03:47.891 --> 03:50.126
Would you believe the board     
of directors is asking          

03:50.161 --> 03:51.560
for a breakdown                 
of projected earnings           

03:51.595 --> 03:53.596
for the next six months?        

03:55.032 --> 03:56.465
                    Yes.        

03:57.567 --> 03:58.634
                        NORM:   
                        Rebecca,

03:58.669 --> 04:00.019
    I started painting          
    Mr. Drake's house.          

04:00.053 --> 04:01.887
      I want to thank you       
    for that recommendation.    

04:01.922 --> 04:02.889
 Oh, it was my pleasure, Norm.  

04:02.923 --> 04:04.157
        How's it going?         

04:04.191 --> 04:05.407
         Great, great.          

04:05.442 --> 04:06.876
He's out of town for a few days 
            so, uh,             

04:06.910 --> 04:09.378
 I thought it'd be a good time  
 to get started in his bedroom. 

04:09.412 --> 04:11.181
            I was doing a little
            prep work over there
            this morning,       

04:11.215 --> 04:12.882
     and I must say, that's     
      a cute photo of you       

04:12.916 --> 04:14.517
          he has next           
to his night stand there.       

04:14.551 --> 04:16.151
             What?              

04:16.185 --> 04:16.653
                Just kidding.   

04:19.807 --> 04:21.173
I will kill you, Norm.          

04:21.208 --> 04:22.408
                You know, uh,   

04:22.442 --> 04:23.993
                 I am over there
                 all by myself, 

04:24.027 --> 04:25.662
             so if you want     
             to drop by and, uh,

04:25.696 --> 04:26.996
                  check any of  
                  the house out,

04:27.030 --> 04:28.598
            I can get you in.   

04:28.632 --> 04:31.333
         No... I can't.         

04:31.368 --> 04:32.719
Oh, go on.                      

04:32.753 --> 04:34.420
You're dying to look            
in his drawers.                 

04:35.755 --> 04:38.507
That's right,                   
he won't be there.              

04:40.360 --> 04:42.545
The last thing on my mind       
         is Evan Drake          

04:42.579 --> 04:43.979
      and where he sleeps.      

04:44.014 --> 04:45.097
No, I don't want                
to be distracted.               

04:45.132 --> 04:47.934
I've got to get these figures   
into the bed of directors...    

04:47.968 --> 04:50.319
      board of directors.       

04:51.221 --> 04:52.772
                    Shall we say
                    in one hour?

04:52.806 --> 04:54.858
                  REBECCA:      
                  I'll be there.

04:58.662 --> 04:59.612
        Excuse me,              

04:59.647 --> 05:00.946
I'm looking for Dr. Crane.      

05:00.981 --> 05:02.415
He mentioned he'd be here.      

05:02.449 --> 05:03.733
         Oh, I'm sorry,         
      you just missed him.      

05:03.767 --> 05:05.034
Oh, darn.                       

05:05.068 --> 05:06.736
I had a session                 
earlier today                   

05:06.770 --> 05:08.404
and left a package              
in his office.                  

05:08.439 --> 05:10.707
When I went back,               
it was locked.                  

05:10.741 --> 05:11.991
    Gee, I don't know           
    what to tell you.           

05:12.025 --> 05:14.126
  But then again, I don't know  
what to tell most people.       

05:14.161 --> 05:16.713
Uh, excuse me.                  

05:16.747 --> 05:18.014
Uh, you had a session           
with him?                       

05:18.048 --> 05:19.915
Are you a patient of his?       

05:19.949 --> 05:21.150
              That's right. Why?

05:21.185 --> 05:22.518
Oh, just curious.               

05:29.943 --> 05:31.210
                 Well, it's not 
                 that important.

05:31.245 --> 05:32.678
                I just thought  
                if I caught him,

05:32.712 --> 05:34.314
            I could still       
            get my package back.

05:34.348 --> 05:35.714
I understand perfectly.         

05:42.105 --> 05:43.573
            Well, I'm out       
            of luck, I guess.   

05:43.607 --> 05:45.608
            I'll just have      
            to stop by tomorrow.

to agree with you.
