WEBVTT

00:03.037 --> 00:04.738
PREVIOUSLY ON
 PRETTY LITTLE LIARS...

00:04.772 --> 00:06.540
THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT FROM
FROM ALI'S CLAIM TICKET?

00:06.574 --> 00:07.808
CHECK IT OUT.
WHAT IS THAT?

00:07.841 --> 00:09.577
IT'S A PHONE NUMBER.
LET'S CALL IT.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.279
I DON'T WANT TO DO
 THIS ON THE PHONE.

00:11.312 --> 00:12.680
WILL YOU MEET ME?

00:12.713 --> 00:14.315
Holden: ARE WE STILL
 ON FOR SATURDAY?

00:14.348 --> 00:16.283
I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN HANDLE IT

00:16.317 --> 00:17.685
IF YOU'RE
HURTING YOURSELF.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.187
WHAT DOES THE DILAURENTIS
FAMILY HAVE ON US?

00:19.220 --> 00:20.454
IT'S COMPLICATED.

00:20.488 --> 00:22.190
MY DAD,
IS HE YOUR FATHER TOO?

00:22.223 --> 00:23.591
LET'S GO HOME.
WHERE'S HOME?

00:23.624 --> 00:25.059
THAT'S A JOKE.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.427
YOU JUST GOTTA STOP
WORKING ON THESE VIDEOS.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.096
THEY'RE DANGEROUS.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.430
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE PEOPLE
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:29.463 --> 00:31.299
ARE IN THIS
TOWN WATCHING ME.

00:31.332 --> 00:33.067
TAKE THIS HOME
AND BURN IT.

00:33.101 --> 00:34.568
IS IT PAGE FIVE?

00:34.602 --> 00:38.072
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT THAT
COULD LINK US TO THAT NIGHT.

00:38.106 --> 00:39.407
( chatter )

00:39.440 --> 00:41.409
OUR CHAMPIONSHIP
 ROSEWOOD SHARKS

00:41.442 --> 00:42.743
ARE RUNNING A LITTLE BEHIND

00:42.776 --> 00:46.247
BUT THEY'LL BE
 HERE ANY MINUTE.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.216
I THOUGHT YOU COULDN'T GET
ONLINE IN THIS CAVE.

00:48.249 --> 00:50.284
I'VE GOT A HOTSPOT
IN MY POCKET.

00:50.318 --> 00:53.287
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT WHAT DOES
THAT HAVE TO DO WITH COMPUTERS?

00:53.321 --> 00:57.158
I AM THE WIFI.

00:57.191 --> 00:59.793
KOO-KOO-KATCHOO.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.495
WHERE ARE THEY?

01:01.529 --> 01:03.497
I TOLD MY MOM WE'D BE
STUDYING AT THE LIBRARY

01:03.531 --> 01:04.532
SO THAT'S COVERED.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.735
GOOD.

01:07.768 --> 01:09.637
YOU SURE YOU WANNA
DO THIS TONIGHT?

01:09.670 --> 01:12.240
YEAH, ARE YOU KIDDING?

01:12.273 --> 01:14.108
WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT
THIS GUY KNOWS ABOUT ALI.

01:14.142 --> 01:16.877
AND WHY HIS NUMBER WAS IN
ALI'S-- VIVIAN'S COAT.

01:16.910 --> 01:20.881
AND WE FINALLY GOT THIS MEETING
SET, SO IT'S GOTTA BE TONIGHT.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.783
LOOK, WE'RE GONNA HAVE
YOUR BACK THE WHOLE TIME.

01:22.816 --> 01:25.386
I KNOW.

01:25.419 --> 01:29.490
SO MY MOM TALKED
TO YOUR MOM.

01:29.523 --> 01:31.792
YOU KNOW IT WASN'T JUST
ONE SLEEPOVER, SPENCE.

01:31.825 --> 01:32.893
IT'S BEEN A WHOLE WEEK.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.495
MY MOM JUST
WANTS TO KNOW

01:34.528 --> 01:35.529
WHY YOU'RE NOT
GOING HOME.

01:35.563 --> 01:38.499
I JUST--

01:38.532 --> 01:41.135
I CAN'T DEAL WITH
MY FAMILY RIGHT NOW.

01:41.169 --> 01:42.670
CAN I HELP?

01:42.703 --> 01:45.639
( cheers and applause )

01:49.410 --> 01:50.878
YEAH!
YEAH!

01:59.187 --> 02:00.288
HI.

02:02.323 --> 02:05.493
I KNOW,
THE SIGN'S KINDA NERDY.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.295
THE SIGN'S BEAUTIFUL.

02:07.328 --> 02:08.862
WAY TO GO, CHAMP!
HEY!

02:08.895 --> 02:12.366
EM, MY MOM SAID THAT WE COULD
HAVE THE TEAM PARTY AT MY HOUSE.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.501
THAT'S GREAT!
YEAH.

02:13.534 --> 02:16.470
( chatter continues )

02:32.386 --> 02:33.487
CALEB RIVERS?

02:33.521 --> 02:36.390
( computer whirrs )

02:36.424 --> 02:38.526
I GOT A COURT ORDER HERE
TO IMPOUND YOUR LAPTOP.

02:38.559 --> 02:39.927
WHAT FOR?

02:39.960 --> 02:42.296
SOMEONE'S BEEN HACKING
INTO SECURE SCHOOL FILES.

02:42.330 --> 02:45.333
I TRACED THEM BACK
TO YOUR IP ADDRESS.

02:45.366 --> 02:46.700
YOU THINK IF I DID
SOMETHING LIKE THAT

02:46.734 --> 02:48.269
I'D BE STUPID ENOUGH
TO LEAVE A TRAIL?

02:48.302 --> 02:50.604
WE'LL FIND OUT.
COME ON. HAND IT OVER.

02:56.710 --> 02:59.213
ANY PASSWORDS
WE'RE GONNA NEED?

02:59.247 --> 03:01.649
COURT ORDER SAYS YOU
CAN TAKE THE MACHINE.

03:01.682 --> 03:06.354
IT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT WHAT'S IN MY HEAD.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.726
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

03:12.760 --> 03:13.894
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

03:13.927 --> 03:15.296
"DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT?"

03:15.329 --> 03:16.764
HE TOOK YOUR COMPUTER.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.899
THEY COULDN'T GET INTO
IT WITH A CAN OPENER.

03:18.932 --> 03:22.770
( sighs )
BE RIGHT BACK.

03:25.439 --> 03:26.774
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

03:26.807 --> 03:29.543
GARRET TOOK
CALEB'S COMPUTER.
COURT ORDER.

03:29.577 --> 03:33.281
( four phones beep )

03:47.895 --> 03:50.664
* GOT A SECRET,
 CAN YOU KEEP IT *

03:50.698 --> 03:53.267
* SWEAR THIS ONE
 YOU'LL SAVE *

03:53.301 --> 03:55.002
* BETTER LOCK IT
 IN YOUR POCKET *

03:55.035 --> 03:57.571
* TAKIN' THIS ONE
 TO THE GRAVE *

03:57.605 --> 03:59.873
* IF I SHOW YOU
 THEN I KNOW YOU *

03:59.907 --> 04:03.377
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID

04:03.411 --> 04:07.348
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN KEEP A SECRET
 IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD *

04:09.583 --> 04:12.553
WHY AREN'T YOU MORE
FREAKED OUT ABOUT THIS?

04:12.586 --> 04:14.322
I THINK YOU'RE FREAKED OUT
ENOUGH FOR THE BOTH OF US.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.390
HEY. I DIDN'T DO
WHAT THEY THINK I DID.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.891
THEY'RE JUST FISHING.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.527
THEY MADE IT UP.
THERE'S NOTHING ON MY LAPTOP.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.362
WHAT ABOUT THE INFORMATION
FROM THE PHONE WE GAVE YOU?

04:21.394 --> 04:24.298
I KEEP IT ON FLASH DRIVES.
II BACK IT UP ONLINE.

04:24.332 --> 04:25.699
BESIDES, IF THERE WAS SHADY
STUFF ON MY COMPUTER,

04:25.733 --> 04:26.734
IT STILL WOULDN'T MATTER.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.536
YES, IT WOULD.
IT DOES.

04:28.569 --> 04:30.604
NO, THEY COULDN'T GET
THROUGH MY FIREWALL.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.306
NOT WITHOUT MY HELP.

04:32.340 --> 04:33.541
CALEB, YOU KNOW HOW
I WAS WORRIED

04:33.574 --> 04:35.576
ABOUT SOMETHING BAD
HAPPENING TO YOU?

04:35.609 --> 04:37.077
IF YOU KEPT DECODING
THE STUPID PHONE?

04:37.110 --> 04:38.712
YEAH.

04:38.746 --> 04:40.414
WELL, THIS IS IT.

04:40.448 --> 04:41.715
SOMEONE BROKE INTO
YOUR COMPUTER

04:41.749 --> 04:43.651
AND PUT THOSE STOLEN FILES
ON YOUR HARD DRIVE

04:43.684 --> 04:45.419
WHERE YOU WOULDN'T BE
ABLE TO FIND THEM.

04:45.453 --> 04:48.889
AND I THINK THAT SOMEONE
MIGHT BE GARRETT.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.524
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

04:50.558 --> 04:51.625
I JUST DO.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.361
SO CAN'T YOU JUST GO ONLINE

04:53.394 --> 04:55.028
AND DO THAT MAGIC THING
WHERE YOU REMOTELY

04:55.062 --> 04:57.498
HACK INTO YOUR COMPUTER AND
ERASE ALL THE SCARY, BAD STUFF?

04:57.531 --> 04:59.032
IT'S A REAL THING, RIGHT?

04:59.066 --> 05:01.769
YEAH.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.805
YEAH, I CAN DO THAT.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.407
HOLDEN, I TOLD YOU.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.841
I CAN'T COVER FOR YOU

05:07.875 --> 05:09.510
UNLESS I KNOW WHAT IT
IS THAT YOU'RE DOING

05:09.543 --> 05:11.111
AND WHY IT INVOLVES THESE
BAGGIES FILLED WITH--

05:11.144 --> 05:12.680
I DO TANG SOO DO.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.548
WHAT?

05:14.582 --> 05:17.418
IT'S A MARTIAL ART.
IT'S KOREAN.

05:17.451 --> 05:20.421
I COMPETE, AND MY PARENTS
DON'T LIKE IT.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.390
THEY FORBID
ME TO KEEP TRAINING.

05:22.423 --> 05:25.092
ARE WE TALKING, LIKE,
BASEMENTS AND NAKED LIGHT BULBS,

05:25.125 --> 05:26.093
PEOPLE MISSING ALL
THEIR TEETH?

05:26.126 --> 05:29.129
NO. EVERYONE'S GOT TEETH.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.064
HOLDEN, I'M SERIOUS.

05:31.098 --> 05:34.101
THAT BRUISE WAS
PRETTY INTENSE.

05:34.134 --> 05:36.604
ALL BETTER.

05:36.637 --> 05:39.873
THOSE PILLS WERE
JUST SOME PAIN MEDS

05:39.907 --> 05:41.575
I NEVER EVEN USED.

05:41.609 --> 05:44.478
IT'S REALLY
NOT A BIG DEAL.

05:44.512 --> 05:46.747
AND THERE'S
A TOURNAMENT COMING UP.

05:46.780 --> 05:49.116
IT'S A BIG ONE, AND TOMORROW
NIGHT'S THE QUALIFIERS.

05:49.149 --> 05:51.719
I-- I CAN'T MISS IT.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.887
SO, PLEASE.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.123
THIS IS REALLY
IMPORTANT TO ME.

06:02.095 --> 06:03.063
OKAY.

06:03.096 --> 06:05.633
ALL RIGHT.

06:05.666 --> 06:08.702
IT'S A DATE.

06:08.736 --> 06:10.404
( typing )

06:10.438 --> 06:13.474
ALL THE LETTERS ARE INITIALS OF
CITIES WHERE I GREW UP

06:13.507 --> 06:14.575
IN THE ORDER
THAT I LIVED THERE.

06:14.608 --> 06:17.578
SO, SEATTLE, WILMETTE, ETC.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.513
I ALSO ALTERNATE
CAPITAL LETTERS.

06:19.547 --> 06:22.550
( typing )

06:22.583 --> 06:24.852
1105? WHAT'S THAT?

06:24.885 --> 06:26.920
NOTHING. JUST A NUMBER.

06:26.954 --> 06:28.989
IT'S GOOD TO USE
NUMBERS IN YOUR PASSWORD.

06:29.022 --> 06:31.459
JUST A NUMBER?
THERE WAS AN EXCLAMATION
POINT AFTER IT.

06:31.492 --> 06:35.162
YEAH, WELL, IT'S GOOD
TO USE PUNCTUATION TOO.

06:35.195 --> 06:36.797
ONCE I'M LOGGED IN,

06:36.830 --> 06:38.766
I CAN SEARCH AND DESTROY
ALL OF THE FILES I WANT.

06:38.799 --> 06:41.168
CRAP!

06:41.201 --> 06:42.970
WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG?

06:43.003 --> 06:44.605
I CAN'T CONNECT.

06:44.638 --> 06:46.940
WELL, DON'T YOU HAVE
YOUR HOT THING?

06:46.974 --> 06:49.042
SPOT. YEAH, BUT THE PROBLEM
IS ON THE OTHER END.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.645
EITHER THEY HAVEN'T EVEN TRIED
TO MESS WITH MY COMPUTER YET,

06:51.679 --> 06:56.517
OR THEY'RE SMART ENOUGH
TO KEEP IT OFFLINE.

06:56.550 --> 06:59.219
WHY ARE YOU HAVING
DRINKS WITH NOREEN?

06:59.252 --> 07:00.588
WHY DO YOU THINK?

07:00.621 --> 07:02.890
ARIA NEEDS A RIDE
INTO THE CITY.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.925
HOLDEN?
MMM-HMM.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.126
WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?

07:06.159 --> 07:08.095
ABOUT 15 MINUTES AGO.

07:08.128 --> 07:12.065
WELL, I HATE NOREEN.

07:12.099 --> 07:15.536
I KNOW, THAT'S WHY
I DIDN'T INVITE YOU.

07:15.569 --> 07:18.205
THAT ONE GOES
TO THE BOOK FAIR.

07:18.238 --> 07:22.710
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WERE OPEN
TO LETTING ARIA TAKE THE TRAIN,

07:22.743 --> 07:24.912
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO FIND WAYS
TO KILL TIME IN PHILADELPHIA.

07:24.945 --> 07:29.082
OR, ARIA AND HOLDEN CAN JUST DO
SOMETHING RIGHT HERE IN TOWN.

07:29.116 --> 07:32.486
BYRON, WHEN ARE WE GONNA
LOOSEN THE LEASH A LITTLE?

07:32.520 --> 07:34.254
HASN'T SHE WON BACK
SOME OF OUR TRUST?

07:34.287 --> 07:36.023
I MEAN,
SHE STOPPED SEEING FITZ,

07:36.056 --> 07:38.526
SHE'S DATING A NICE KID WE'VE
KNOWN SINCE PRE-SCHOOL.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.160
SECOND GUESSING
HER EVERY MOVE

07:40.193 --> 07:41.929
IS STARTING TO FEEL
A LITTLE EXTREME.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.532
NO, DATING YOUR ENGLISH
TEACHER IS EXTREME.

07:44.565 --> 07:46.600
ALL RIGHT?
WE ARE BEING PARENTS.

07:46.634 --> 07:47.635
WE'RE BEING--

07:47.668 --> 07:49.670
I'M SORRY.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.138
I'M JUST NOT READY YET.

07:51.171 --> 07:55.108
OKAY? I'LL COME BACK
FOR THE OTHER BOX.

07:56.644 --> 07:59.580
( street noise )

08:14.294 --> 08:17.565
( girl laughs )

08:17.598 --> 08:20.167
( inaudible dialogue )

08:31.612 --> 08:32.813
( clears throat )

08:36.717 --> 08:38.051
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.953
YOUR OFFICE IS CLOSED.

08:39.986 --> 08:42.121
YEAH, I ONLY WORK
A COUPLE HOURS A DAY.

08:42.155 --> 08:45.325
GETTING THE PLACE UP
AND RUNNING AGAIN.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.960
DID YOUR FATHER SEND YOU?

08:46.994 --> 08:49.296
NO, I HAVEN'T TALKED TO HIM.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.999
YOU STILL DON'T BELIEVE IT.

08:52.032 --> 08:55.235
I BELIEVE IT, THAT'S WHY
I HAVEN'T TALKED TO HIM.

08:55.268 --> 08:57.137
I HAVEN'T TALKED
TO ANYBODY ABOUT THIS.

08:57.170 --> 09:00.040
WELL, YOU BETTER
TALK TO YOUR DAD.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.644
NO, I'M TALKING TO YOU.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.112
( sighs )

09:05.145 --> 09:07.314
LOOK, I DIDN'T
COME BACK HERE

09:07.347 --> 09:08.649
TO GET BETWEEN
YOU AND YOUR FATHER.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.083
WELL IT'S A LITTLE
LATE FOR THAT.

09:10.117 --> 09:13.086
I'M SORRY.
I REALLY AM.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.321
THIS WAS NEVER
ABOUT HURTING YOU.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.056
WELL, WHAT IS IT ABOUT?

09:16.089 --> 09:19.259
PLEASE, JASON.

09:19.292 --> 09:22.863
YOU LEFT TOWN THE NIGHT
THAT I WAS ARRESTED.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.297
SO WHAT MADE YOU
COME BACK NOW?

09:28.802 --> 09:32.205
IT WAS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE
BOXES ALI LIKED SO MUCH.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.674
I FOUND IT UNDER
THE FLOORBOARDS

09:33.707 --> 09:34.875
OF A ROOM AT MY
GRANDMOTHER'S.

09:34.908 --> 09:38.646
WHY HIDE THINGS
THAT STAY HID?

09:38.679 --> 09:40.648
SOMETHING ALI USED TO SAY.

09:42.716 --> 09:47.187
THERE WERE LETTERS
TO MY MOM FROM YOUR DAD.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.992
LOVE LETTERS?

09:52.025 --> 09:53.126
COUPLE OF THOSE.

09:54.895 --> 10:00.233
THEN I'M BORN, AND HE STARTS
SOUNDING LIKE A LAWYER.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.102
"IN LIGHT OF RECENT EVENTS."
"UNDER THE CURRENT SITUATION."

10:02.135 --> 10:03.671
THAT'S MY DAD.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.908
THERE WAS SOMETHING
ELSE IN THAT BOX.

10:09.777 --> 10:12.212
$15,000 IN CASH.

10:12.245 --> 10:13.747
IN ENVELOPES.

10:13.781 --> 10:16.016
$5,000 IN EACH ONE.

10:16.049 --> 10:18.085
WHERE WOULD ALI HAVE
GOTTEN THAT KIND OF MONEY?

10:18.118 --> 10:20.253
THINK ABOUT IT.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.995
SHE FOUND THOSE LETTERS

10:28.028 --> 10:30.864
AND FIGURED OUT
WHAT THEY MEANT

10:30.898 --> 10:33.701
AND THEN SHE BLACKMAILED
MY FATHER TO KEEP FROM

10:33.734 --> 10:36.136
BLOWING UP BOTH FAMILIES.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.708
I KNOW.

10:40.741 --> 10:43.944
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
WHEN YOU SAY IT OUT LOUD.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.246
YEAH, BUT IF ANYBODY HAD THE
NERVE TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT

10:46.279 --> 10:49.249
IT WAS ALI.

10:49.282 --> 10:52.152
( background music )

10:52.185 --> 10:54.888
( bell rings, chatter )

11:10.370 --> 11:15.108
SO, YOU'RE A FRIEND
OF VIVIAN'S.

11:15.142 --> 11:16.109
YEAH.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.752
HOW MUCH MONEY
DOES SHE OWE YOU?

11:24.785 --> 11:27.921
VIVIAN OWES YOU MONEY?

11:27.955 --> 11:29.489
SHE OWES ME A LOT
MORE THAN MONEY.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.192
SHE OWES ME A JOB AND SHE
ALMOST OWES ME A GIRLFRIEND

11:32.225 --> 11:34.194
THANKS TO YOU
CALLING THAT NUMBER.

11:34.227 --> 11:37.865
YOU SAID THAT
SHE COST YOU A JOB.
WHAT DID SHE DO?

11:37.898 --> 11:41.468
I WORKED AT ALLEGHENY CELLULAR.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.036
HUMAN RESOURCES.

11:43.070 --> 11:45.272
YOUR FRIEND CAME
IN ASKING FOR A JOB,

11:45.305 --> 11:47.741
BUT SHE DIDN'T WANT A JOB,
SHE WANTED INFORMATION,

11:47.775 --> 11:48.809
AND SHE SAID
SHE'D PAY FOR IT.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.477
WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION?

11:50.510 --> 11:53.914
I GET IT.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.148
YOU'RE ALISON.

12:02.089 --> 12:04.124
VIVIAN TOLD YOU
ABOUT ALISON?

12:04.157 --> 12:08.195
SHE SAID SHE HAD
A FRIEND NAMED ALISON

12:08.228 --> 12:09.797
THAT WAS GETTING
TEXTS FROM SOMEBODY.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.164
THE NUMBER WAS BLOCKED

12:11.198 --> 12:13.366
AND SHE WANTED TO KNOW
WHERE THEY WERE COMING FROM.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.968
SHE'D PAY TO FIND OUT.

12:15.002 --> 12:17.938
DID YOU FIND OUT?

12:17.971 --> 12:20.073
YEAH, I FOUND OUT.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.209
THEN I MADE THE MISTAKE
OF TELLING YOUR PAL

12:22.242 --> 12:23.944
BEFORE I HAD THE
MONEY IN MY HAND.

12:23.977 --> 12:25.545
SHE DROPPED OFF THE MAP
AND I GOT FIRED

12:25.578 --> 12:27.514
FOR ACCESSING RESTRICTED
INFORMATION.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.049
WHAT DID YOU FIND
OUT ABOUT THE PERSON

12:29.082 --> 12:31.084
THAT WAS SENDING
THOSE TEXTS?

12:31.118 --> 12:33.921
ARE YOU LISTENING?
I DID NOT GET PAID.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.388
I WANT WHAT SHE OWES ME.

12:35.422 --> 12:38.191
HOW MUCH DOES
SHE OWE YOU?

12:38.225 --> 12:39.860
$2,000.

12:39.893 --> 12:42.029
$2,000 DOLLARS?

12:42.062 --> 12:45.565
THAT'S THE PRICE TODAY.

12:45.598 --> 12:48.902
BUT IT COULD GO UP DEPENDING
ON MARKET CONDITIONS.

12:55.208 --> 12:58.111
DON'T EVER USE
THAT NUMBER AGAIN.

12:58.145 --> 13:00.313
IF YOU WANNA DO BUSINESS,
CALL ME HERE.

13:01.548 --> 13:04.852
OH, WHO DO I ASK FOR
WHEN I CALL?

13:04.885 --> 13:07.487
TELL 'EM YOU
WANNA TALK TO JONAH.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.334
HE THOUGHT I WAS ALI.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.270
THAT MEANS HE DOESN'T
KNOW SHE'S DEAD.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.838
AND IF HE FINDS OUT THERE WON'T
BE ENOUGH MONEY IN THE WORLD

13:24.872 --> 13:26.073
TO MAKE HIM TALK.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.340
IF THIS JONAH HAD
REAL INFORMATION

13:27.374 --> 13:29.109
ALI MIGHT'VE KNOWN
WHO "A" WAS.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.078
AND THAT'S WHY
SHE WAS KILLED.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.280
WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT HE
TOLD HER ABOUT THOSE MESSAGES.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.848
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?

13:34.882 --> 13:36.583
THROW A BIKINI CAR WASH?

13:36.616 --> 13:38.986
EVEN IF WE TALKED PRUDENCE
FINN INTO A TUBE TOP,

13:39.019 --> 13:42.890
WE WOULDN'T RAISE
ENOUGH MONEY.

13:42.923 --> 13:46.126
SPENCER?

13:46.159 --> 13:49.429
MY ACCOUNT'S BEEN ON LOCK DOWN
SINCE WE WERE ARRESTED.

13:49.462 --> 13:51.398
SO WHERE ARE WE GONNA
GET THE MONEY FROM?

13:53.466 --> 13:56.937
DO HAVE ANY IDEA WHEN
I CAN GET THE THING BACK?

13:56.970 --> 13:59.272
BECAUSE I'M
A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT.

13:59.306 --> 14:01.308
I'VE GOT PAPERS TO WRITE
AND HOMEWORK TO DO.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.576
PLUS, THEY COST
A LOT OF MONEY.

14:03.610 --> 14:06.947
PLUS, IT'S MINE.

14:08.248 --> 14:09.516
( scoffs, beeps )

14:09.549 --> 14:11.251
CALEB, WAS THAT THE COPS?

14:11.284 --> 14:12.652
WHAT'D THEY SAY?

14:12.685 --> 14:14.487
THEY SAID I COULD GET
MY LAPTOP BACK TODAY.

14:14.521 --> 14:15.488
REALLY?

14:15.522 --> 14:16.957
YEAH, IF I COOPERATE.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.458
WHAT'RE YOU GOING TO DO?

14:23.063 --> 14:25.232
( exhales )

14:28.401 --> 14:30.270
SO, WE'RE ON FOR TONIGHT.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.005
I WORKED THINGS OUT ON MY END.

14:32.039 --> 14:35.342
GOOD, 'CAUSE WE REALLY GOTTA
TALK ABOUT THAT INTERVIEW.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.544
I NEED TO GET BACK TO SHAFFER
TOMORROW AT THE LATEST.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.012
YEAH, WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT.

14:39.046 --> 14:42.349
I KNOW THIS IS A HUGE
OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.184
NO, THAT'S NOT
 WHAT MATTERS.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.186
IT'S WHAT YOUR DAD THINKS
IF I DON'T TAKE IT.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.555
YEAH, WELL, MAYBE HE SHOULD
JUST MOVE TO NEW ORLEANS.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.190
( laughs )

14:50.223 --> 14:51.691
WE SHOULD HAVE THIS
 CONVERSATION FACE TO FACE,

14:51.724 --> 14:53.961
BUT I JUST DON'T
REALLY KNOW WHERE.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.462
I DO.

14:55.495 --> 14:58.298
THERE'S THIS TINY,
HOLE IN THE WALL VEGAN PLACE

14:58.331 --> 15:00.033
THAT JUST OPENED UP,
CENTER CITY.

15:00.067 --> 15:02.469
WAIT, A RESTAURANT?

15:02.502 --> 15:04.938
LOWER YOUR EXPECTATIONS.
IT SEATS TWO.

15:04.972 --> 15:07.107
OH, SO IT'S BIGGER
THAN YOUR APARTMENT.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.308
( laughs )

15:08.341 --> 15:09.509
WHAT'S IT CALLED?

15:09.542 --> 15:12.212
CHEZ MIRABELLE VEGAN BISTRO.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.613
FRENCH FOOD?

15:13.646 --> 15:16.116
WOW, YOU MUST REALLY LIKE ME.

15:16.149 --> 15:20.153
ARIA, IT'S FRENCH VEGAN FOOD.
I MUST REALLY LOVE YOU.

15:20.187 --> 15:21.654
( giggles )

15:21.688 --> 15:24.624
( background chatter )

15:28.095 --> 15:31.531
( phone ringing )

15:41.074 --> 15:43.643
TEMPTING, ISN'T IT?

15:43.676 --> 15:45.979
( chuckles )

15:46.013 --> 15:48.381
THE I.T. GUYS
SAY NOT TO OPEN IT.

15:48.415 --> 15:50.350
IT COULD CONNECT
TO THE WIRELESS.

15:50.383 --> 15:54.221
YOUR, UH, YOUR GUYS HAVE
ANY LUCK GETTING IN?

15:54.254 --> 15:55.355
NOT YET.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.490
MIGHT HAVE TO SEND
IT TO PITTSBURGH.

15:57.524 --> 16:02.162
I-- I BET WE COULD
GET THE KID TO TALK.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.667
SO, ALISON DILAURENTIS
MURDER INVESTIGATION

16:07.700 --> 16:10.137
TURNED UP A NEW
PIECE OF EVIDENCE.

16:10.170 --> 16:13.540
IT HAS TO DO WITH THE MISSING
PAGE OF THE AUTOPSY REPORT.

16:20.180 --> 16:23.216
TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK
IS GOING ON IN THIS PHOTO.

16:37.497 --> 16:41.000
( car alarm beeps )

17:06.693 --> 17:10.063
CAN'T WE GET HIM
A LAWYER OR SOMETHING?

17:10.097 --> 17:11.431
( phone rings )

17:11.464 --> 17:12.565
I KNOW YOU WANNA HELP.

17:12.598 --> 17:13.833
BUT CALEB'S GOT A FAMILY NOW.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.335
IF HE NEEDS LEGAL HELP--

17:15.367 --> 17:16.435
HE WON'T ASK THEM.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.070
HE DOESN'T WANT
THEM TO KNOW.

17:18.105 --> 17:19.472
HE'S BARELY TALKING
TO ME ABOUT IT.

17:19.506 --> 17:21.808
HELLO?

17:21.840 --> 17:24.777
( pop music plays )

17:24.810 --> 17:27.146
I COME BEARING FRUIT.

17:27.180 --> 17:30.750
GREAT.

17:30.783 --> 17:32.785
SOMETHING WRONG?

17:32.819 --> 17:37.190
UM, CAN WE TALK?

17:37.224 --> 17:38.691
SURE.

17:42.129 --> 17:43.363
I'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.198
OKAY.
HEY, MAYA.

17:45.232 --> 17:47.500
HEY.

17:47.534 --> 17:50.103
PUT DOWN THE ICING.

17:50.137 --> 17:51.604
WE'VE BEEN INVITED
TO THE POLICE STATION.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.442
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IT WAS AN OLD JOINT?

17:55.475 --> 17:58.111
OLD, AS IN,
PRE-GETTING BUSTED

17:58.145 --> 17:59.646
AND PACKED OFF TO CAMP
STRAIGHT AND NARROW.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.281
WHERE DID YOUR MOM FIND IT?

18:01.314 --> 18:04.317
WE'VE BEEN GETTING
STUFF OUT OF STORAGE.

18:04.351 --> 18:06.886
BOXES FROM WHEN WE LIVED
IN THE DILAURENTIS HOUSE.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.556
I EVEN FOUND A BOX
OF ALI'S STUFF.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.724
IT WAS IN JUNK
FROM MY DRESSER.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.860
HALF AN OLD,
DRIED-UP JOINT.

18:13.893 --> 18:16.196
YOU EXPLAINED THAT IT
WAS FROM BEFORE, RIGHT?

18:16.229 --> 18:17.864
THEY DON'T BELIEVE ME.

18:17.897 --> 18:21.634
EM, MY FOLKS ARE GONNA
SEND ME BACK TO TRUE NORTH.

18:21.668 --> 18:24.271
WE'LL GO TALK TO YOUR PARENTS.
WE'LL EXPLAIN IT.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.872
I MEAN, THEY CAN'T JUST
SHIP YOU OFF AGAIN.

18:25.905 --> 18:27.340
EMILY--
NO!

18:27.374 --> 18:29.842
I'M NOT GONNA SAY
GOODBYE TO YOU AGAIN.

18:29.876 --> 18:30.810
NEVER.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.220
HOW YOU BEEN, ASHLEY?

18:40.253 --> 18:41.821
FINE.

18:41.854 --> 18:44.157
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

18:44.191 --> 18:48.695
DOESN'T FEEL THAT WAY TO ME.

18:48.728 --> 18:52.832
I CALLED YOU IN TO TALK ABOUT
ALISON'S MURDER INVESTIGATION.

18:52.865 --> 18:54.567
COPIES OF A PARTICULAR PAGE

18:54.601 --> 18:57.537
OF HER AUTOPSY REPORT
HAVE BEEN STOLEN.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.339
WE'VE BEEN
LOOKING INTO IT.

18:59.372 --> 19:01.474
AND WE FOUND THIS.

19:12.919 --> 19:16.456
THIS IS FROM A SECURITY CAMERA
OUTSIDE THE MORGUE.

19:16.489 --> 19:19.526
ANYTHING YOU CAN TELL ME
ABOUT THAT PHOTO HANNA?

19:26.866 --> 19:29.302
AND WHY WEREN'T EMILY
AND SPENCER AND THEIR PARENTS

19:29.336 --> 19:31.338
CALLED IN AS WELL?

19:31.371 --> 19:34.341
HEY. YOU MAY NOT HAVE
TO ANSWER HIS QUESTIONS,

19:34.374 --> 19:36.409
BUT YOU'RE SURE AS HELL
GOING TO ANSWER MINE.

19:36.443 --> 19:37.977
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
IN THOSE OUTFITS?

19:38.010 --> 19:39.612
WE PUT THEM
ON AS A JOKE.

19:39.646 --> 19:41.214
A JOKE.

19:41.248 --> 19:42.949
WE DARED SPENCER
TO GO IN THE MORGUE.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.584
I DIDN'T KNOW THERE
WERE FILES IN THERE.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.719
( phone ringing )

19:46.753 --> 19:49.622
I ALREADY TOLD YOU
I KNOW WHEN YOU'RE LYING.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.691
WE DID NOT TAKE THAT PAGE.

19:53.426 --> 19:56.696
( phone ringing )

20:05.472 --> 20:07.274
MOM SAID THAT
SPENCER JUST LEFT.

20:07.307 --> 20:08.808
SHE GO HOME?

20:08.841 --> 20:10.410
NO, TO HANNA'S.

20:10.443 --> 20:13.446
EM'S THROWING A VICTORY
PARTY FOR THE SWIM TEAM.

20:14.981 --> 20:17.650
SO, WHERE ARE YOU AND HOLDEN
HEADED OFF TO THIS TIME?

20:17.684 --> 20:19.952
SOME NEW ARCADE.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.988
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE ALL
THESE REALLY COOL VINTAGE GAMES.

20:22.021 --> 20:23.690
MS. PACMAN, PINBALL...

20:23.723 --> 20:24.824
OH, THAT SOUNDS FUN.

20:24.857 --> 20:27.427
YEAH.

20:27.460 --> 20:30.630
AND, UH, WHAT TIME
IS MOM TAKING YOU?

20:30.663 --> 20:32.532
UH, NOW-ISH.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.033
AND YOU'LL BE HOME...?

20:34.066 --> 20:36.235
AT 11:00, DAD.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.506
YOU MEETING ANY
OTHER FRIENDS THERE?

20:39.539 --> 20:42.041
NOPE.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.477
IT'S JUST ME AND HOLDEN.

20:44.511 --> 20:47.514
AND SOME NERDY GAMERS WITH
VERY CREATIVE FACIAL HAIR.

20:47.547 --> 20:50.983
ARE YOU HOLDING HER UP?

20:58.758 --> 21:01.994
NO, SHE'S-- SHE'S ALL YOURS.

21:05.031 --> 21:08.968
UM, SO MAYBE IT'S TIME
YOU AND HOLDEN

21:09.001 --> 21:11.070
STARTED HANGING OUT
A LITTLE CLOSER TO HOME.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.306
HOLDEN JUST LIKES
GOING INTO THE CITY.

21:13.340 --> 21:15.074
THERE'S A LOT MORE
TO DO THERE.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.310
MUSEUMS AND STREET FAIRS.

21:17.344 --> 21:18.678
THERE'S MORE THAN
JUST ONE RESTAURANT.

21:18.711 --> 21:21.414
YEAH, BUT FROM THE WAY
HIS MOM TALKS, I MEAN--

21:21.448 --> 21:23.316
I'M SURPRISED
THEY'RE OKAY WITH HIM

21:23.350 --> 21:24.617
BEING THAT FAR AWAY
ALL THE TIME.

21:24.651 --> 21:27.019
FAR AWAY?
IT'S AN HOUR.

21:27.053 --> 21:29.722
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
SHE'S WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

21:29.756 --> 21:30.757
AND IF SOMETHING HAPPENS--

21:30.790 --> 21:32.392
WHAT?

21:32.425 --> 21:34.361
MOM, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?

21:34.394 --> 21:36.529
HONEY, HE HAS
A HEART CONDITION.

21:36.563 --> 21:38.698
HE'S TALKED ABOUT
THAT WITH YOU, HASN'T HE?

21:38.731 --> 21:42.502
YEAH. NO, YEAH, YEAH.
OF COURSE HE HAS.

21:42.535 --> 21:46.339
OKAY. WELL, YOU KNOW.
THINK ABOUT IT.

21:51.478 --> 21:53.846
( party chatter )

21:53.880 --> 21:56.015
THE COPS CALLED THEM
DOWN THERE?

21:56.048 --> 21:57.417
WHICH COPS?

21:57.450 --> 21:58.685
I DON'T KNOW.

21:58.718 --> 21:59.752
THERE WAS A NOTE ON THE COUNTER

21:59.786 --> 22:02.655
WHEN I CAME DOWNSTAIRS
WITH MAYA.

22:02.689 --> 22:04.724
( sighs )

22:04.757 --> 22:06.125
I'M GOING UPSTAIRS

22:06.158 --> 22:08.528
TRUSTING YOU TO KEEP AN EYE
ON EVERYTHING DOWN HERE.

22:08.561 --> 22:10.630
OKAY.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.832
HEY. WHAT'S GOING
ON WITH CALEB?

22:12.865 --> 22:14.133
I DON'T KNOW.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.569
THAT'S NOT WHY WE
WERE CALLED DOWN THERE.

22:16.603 --> 22:18.405
WILDEN'S BACK.

22:18.438 --> 22:20.840
HE STILL THINKS WE
HAD SOMETHING TO DO
WITH ALI'S MURDER.

22:20.873 --> 22:23.876
THERE'S A PHOTO
OF THE THREE OF US OUTSIDE
THE CORONER'S OFFICE

22:23.910 --> 22:25.011
LOOKING FOR PAGE FIVE.

22:25.044 --> 22:26.413
"A" WAS FOLLOWING US?

22:26.446 --> 22:27.780
NO. SECURITY CAMERAS.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.549
THERE'S AN INVESTIGATION
GOING ON;

22:29.582 --> 22:31.384
HE SAID THE COPIES
OF THAT PAGE ARE MISSING.

22:31.418 --> 22:33.620
COPIES?
AS IN EVERY COPY?

22:33.653 --> 22:35.988
IF THE COPS DON'T HAVE IT
THEN IT HAD TO HAVE BEEN
AN INSIDE JOB.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.790
GARRETT.

22:37.824 --> 22:39.792
OFFICER TWO-FACE IS GONNA
OPEN THAT LAPTOP.

22:39.826 --> 22:41.728
I MEAN, WHAT IF
CALEB GOES TO JAIL?

22:41.761 --> 22:43.062
IT'S GONNA BE
ALL MY FAULT.

22:43.095 --> 22:45.432
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

22:45.465 --> 22:49.001
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

22:49.035 --> 22:51.003
JONAH KNOWS SOMETHING
THAT COULD HELP US

22:51.037 --> 22:53.105
FIGURE OUT WHAT REALLY
HAPPENED TO ALISON.

22:53.139 --> 22:55.442
WILDEN IS JUST GONNA
KEEP ON COMING AFTER US.

22:55.475 --> 22:57.143
SO WE NEED TO FIND OUT
WHO KILLED ALISON

22:57.176 --> 22:58.645
SO WE CAN PROVE
IT WASN'T US.

22:58.678 --> 23:01.147
OKAY, UNLESS YOU FOUND
$2,000 WHILE I WAS OUT--

23:01.180 --> 23:02.582
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

23:02.615 --> 23:06.853
HOME.

23:06.886 --> 23:09.822
( distant sirens wail )

23:11.791 --> 23:14.894
THERE WAS SOME WEIRD
ENERGY IN THAT CAR.

23:14.927 --> 23:16.629
IS YOUR MOM
STARTING TO WONDER?

23:16.663 --> 23:19.165
NO. NO,
THEY'RE CLUELESS.

23:19.198 --> 23:21.668
OKAY, WELL I'M THIS WAY
AND I'M GONNA BE LATE.

23:21.701 --> 23:22.702
YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING?

23:22.735 --> 23:24.036
YEAH.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.872
HOLDEN.

23:27.807 --> 23:30.076
THIS TOURNAMENT,
IS IT DANGEROUS?

23:30.109 --> 23:34.080
I GET IT.
YOU'RE STILL ON THAT BRUISE.

23:34.113 --> 23:36.082
DON'T WORRY.

23:36.115 --> 23:38.084
I GOT A REMATCH AGAINST
THE GUY WHO GAVE IT TO ME.

23:38.117 --> 23:41.554
IT'S GONNA BE EPIC.
WISH ME LUCK.

23:41.588 --> 23:43.022
( silently )
BYE.

24:38.010 --> 24:39.679
( door closes )

24:42.214 --> 24:43.482
SPENCER?

24:48.688 --> 24:50.222
I'M GLAD YOU
CAME HOME.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.198
SHE WAS IN BOSTON.

24:59.231 --> 25:02.234
KEN AND JESSICA HAD
AN APARTMENT ON WILLOUGHBY.

25:02.268 --> 25:04.103
THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

25:04.136 --> 25:08.007
WHAT HAPPENED IS,

25:08.040 --> 25:10.977
I MADE A SERIES
OF VERY POOR DECISIONS.

25:12.879 --> 25:15.214
YOU MAKE IT SOUND
LIKE A BUSINESS DEAL.

25:15.247 --> 25:16.749
THIS WASN'T
A BAD INVESTMENT.

25:16.783 --> 25:18.184
YOU CHEATED

25:18.217 --> 25:20.286
AND YOU GOT SOMEBODY
ELSE'S WIFE PREGNANT.

25:20.319 --> 25:21.888
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

25:21.921 --> 25:23.556
( inhales )

25:23.590 --> 25:24.991
YES.

25:29.796 --> 25:31.163
AND SHE KEPT THE BABY.

25:31.197 --> 25:34.033
SHE KEPT THE BABY.

25:34.066 --> 25:36.636
SHE LIED TO HER HUSBAND,
THEY MOVED TO ATLANTA.

25:36.669 --> 25:39.138
I MARRIED YOUR MOTHER.

25:39.171 --> 25:41.040
JUST LIKE
NOTHING HAPPENED.

25:43.375 --> 25:44.677
THEN THEY MOVED BACK.

25:44.711 --> 25:47.179
YEAH, RIGHT NEXT DOOR.

25:47.213 --> 25:51.651
YOU WERE FIVE.

25:51.684 --> 25:54.220
FIRST TIME I SAW JASON,
HE WAS IN FRONT OF THAT HOUSE.

25:54.253 --> 25:57.590
JUST RIDING HIS BIKE.

25:57.624 --> 26:00.159
AND HOW DID THAT
MAKE YOU FEEL?

26:07.900 --> 26:09.902
WHY DID THEY COME BACK?

26:09.936 --> 26:13.372
I NEVER ASKED.

26:13.405 --> 26:17.076
I WAS AFRAID SHE
MIGHT TELL ME.

26:17.109 --> 26:20.146
JASON THINKS THAT
ALISON KNEW ABOUT YOU
LONG BEFORE HE DID.

26:20.179 --> 26:23.182
I GUESS THAT'S POSSIBLE.
I DON'T KNOW.

26:23.215 --> 26:25.317
REALLY? YOU SURE
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW?

26:25.351 --> 26:26.953
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

26:26.986 --> 26:28.955
IT MEANS THAT JASON
FOUND SOME MONEY

26:28.988 --> 26:31.758
AND LETTERS FROM YOU.

26:31.791 --> 26:35.061
SO DID ALI EVER
ASK YOU FOR MONEY?

26:35.094 --> 26:36.228
FOR WHAT?

26:36.262 --> 26:38.831
TO KEEP HER QUIET?

26:38.865 --> 26:42.702
SPENCER, WAI--

26:42.735 --> 26:46.272
LOOK, I KNOW I DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF CREDIBILITY

26:46.305 --> 26:48.207
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.710
BUT YOU HAVE
TO LISTEN TO ME.

26:50.743 --> 26:52.912
I NEVER GAVE MONEY
TO ANYONE

26:52.945 --> 26:54.881
IN THAT FAMILY
FOR ANY REASON.

27:00.753 --> 27:02.722
( crickets chirping )

27:02.755 --> 27:05.157
UM, DO YOU MIND
IF I SIT OVER THERE?

27:06.392 --> 27:08.327
THANKS.

27:13.299 --> 27:15.768
THANK YOU.

27:19.038 --> 27:22.141
I HOPE YOUR MOM GOT PAIGE
COMING OFF THE PLATFORM.

27:22.174 --> 27:23.810
SHE WAS LIKE A ROCKET.

27:23.843 --> 27:26.746
EM.

27:35.321 --> 27:38.124
HEY. YOU OKAY?

27:38.157 --> 27:39.959
I GUESS I'M NOT
IN A PARTY MOOD.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.094
OH?

27:49.235 --> 27:51.137
CAN WE GO SOMEPLACE?

27:51.170 --> 27:53.439
AFTER THE PARTY?
SURE.

27:58.110 --> 28:00.913
Girl:
EM! YOU'RE MISSING IT!

28:00.947 --> 28:03.682
GO AHEAD.
I'M OKAY.

28:04.817 --> 28:05.752
GO.

28:17.363 --> 28:19.331
WHAT? AND YOU BELIEVE HIM?

28:19.365 --> 28:21.200
YES, I DO.

28:21.233 --> 28:23.202
HE MUST'VE BEEN
REALLY CONVINCING.

28:23.235 --> 28:25.404
I THINK THAT HE WAS
TELLING ME THE TRUTH.

28:25.437 --> 28:27.740
IF HE DIDN'T GIVE ALI
THIS MONEY, THEN WHO DID?

28:29.175 --> 28:30.509
WELL, WHERE IS IT NOW?

28:30.542 --> 28:32.311
THE MONEY.

28:32.344 --> 28:33.913
DOES HE WANT YOU
TO GET IT BACK?

28:33.946 --> 28:36.849
NO. I ALREADY TOLD YOU
HE DIDN'T GIVE IT TO HER.

28:36.883 --> 28:38.851
JUST BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE HIM
DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE TO.

28:38.885 --> 28:40.519
IF ALI WAS
BLACKMAILING SOMEBODY--

28:40.552 --> 28:42.889
NOT SOMEBODY, SPENCER.
IT WAS YOUR FATHER.

28:42.922 --> 28:44.490
WELL, WHAT IF IT WASN'T?

28:44.523 --> 28:45.958
IT HAS TO BE HIM.

28:45.992 --> 28:47.760
YOU DON'T WANT IT
TO BE SOMEONE ELSE.

28:47.794 --> 28:50.763
YOU WANT IT TO BE HIM
SO THAT YOU CAN KEEP
ON BEING ANGRY.

28:50.797 --> 28:54.200
YEAH. YOU WERE
RAISED BY LAWYERS.

28:58.537 --> 29:02.041
( door opens, closes )

29:02.074 --> 29:04.443
MAYA?

29:13.853 --> 29:16.022
HEY! WHERE ARE YOU?

29:16.055 --> 29:17.223
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE
HERE AN HOUR AGO.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.258
THAT ACTUALLY MIGHT
BE A WHILE.

29:19.291 --> 29:21.227
WELL, WHERE ARE
YOU RIGHT NOW?

29:21.260 --> 29:23.195
POLICE STATION.

29:23.229 --> 29:24.864
WHAT, YOU'RE GOING
TO TALK TO THEM?

29:24.897 --> 29:27.433
I DON'T THINK
I HAVE ANY CHOICE.

29:27.466 --> 29:30.402
SO YOU SAID GARRETT KNOWS
HOW TO GET IN ANYWAY?

29:30.436 --> 29:33.539
I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK SO.

29:33.572 --> 29:36.508
HANNA, LISTEN TO ME.
I'M IN A REALLY
HOT SPOT RIGHT NOW.

29:36.542 --> 29:37.576
I KNOW, CALEB.

29:37.609 --> 29:41.047
HANNA, I NEED YOUR HELP.

29:41.080 --> 29:42.214
THIS WAY.

29:46.585 --> 29:47.987
( beep )

29:53.559 --> 29:56.462
( martial arts yells )

30:00.632 --> 30:02.401
Coach: RIGHT! LEFT!
COME ON!

30:02.434 --> 30:05.371
( background chatter )

30:08.474 --> 30:09.842
YAH!

30:22.521 --> 30:24.056
WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

30:24.090 --> 30:26.192
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOUR HEART?

30:26.225 --> 30:28.060
EXCUSE ME?

30:28.094 --> 30:30.997
MY MOM SAYS THAT YOU HAVE
SOME KIND OF CONDITION.

30:31.030 --> 30:32.231
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

30:32.264 --> 30:33.632
IS THIS SOME KIND
OF DEATH WISH?

30:33.665 --> 30:35.634
JUST KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.

30:35.667 --> 30:38.170
NOW WHAT EXACTLY
DID YOUR MOM TELL YOU?

30:38.204 --> 30:40.372
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
I WANNA HEAR IT FROM YOU.

30:40.406 --> 30:42.374
OKAY, I WANNA KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO SAY

30:42.408 --> 30:43.943
WHEN YOU DON'T MAKE IT BACK
AT THE END OF THE NIGHT

30:43.976 --> 30:45.277
BECAUSE SOMEBODY KICKED
YOU IN THE CHEST.

30:45.311 --> 30:47.546
THAT'S NOT GONNA MAKE
MY HEART STOP, ARIA.

30:47.579 --> 30:52.018
I HAVE AN ABDOMINAL
AORTIC ANEURISM, OKAY?

30:52.051 --> 30:53.552
WH-- TELL ME
WHAT THAT MEANS.

30:53.585 --> 30:57.523
IT MEANS THAT
I GOTTA LIVE WITH IT.

30:57.556 --> 30:59.926
IT COULD RUPTURE WHETHER
I'M OUT DOING WHAT I LOVE

30:59.959 --> 31:03.129
OR I'M AT HOME PLAYING
APPLES TO APPLES
WITH MY PARENTS.

31:03.162 --> 31:06.165
I'M NOT GONNA SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE

31:06.198 --> 31:07.900
SITTING IN FRONT
OF A TV.

31:07.934 --> 31:09.301
ESPECIALLY WHEN
THERE'S A DECENT CHANCE

31:09.335 --> 31:11.037
IT'S GONNA BE SHORTER
THAN EVERYONE ELSE'S.

31:11.070 --> 31:14.306
BUT NOT TELLING YOUR PARENTS
THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS,

31:14.340 --> 31:17.609
IT'S REALLY, REALLY
MESSED UP, HOLDEN.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.478
OKAY, AND I KNOW THAT
I'M LYING TO MINE TOO,

31:19.511 --> 31:21.480
BUT IT NOT'S LIKE I'M TAKING
MY LIFE INTO MY OWN HANDS.

31:21.513 --> 31:26.218
LOOK, SOMETIMES WHAT PEOPLE
BELIEVE IS BEST FOR YOU

31:26.252 --> 31:29.521
IS NOT WHAT IS
ACTUALLY BEST FOR YOU.

31:36.162 --> 31:39.298
Ref: GENTLEMEN, LINE UP.
TURN, FACE THE TABLE.

31:44.303 --> 31:45.471
Ref: TO YOUR POSITIONS.

31:48.340 --> 31:51.143
FIGHT STANCE.

31:51.177 --> 31:54.246
( martial arts yells )

31:54.280 --> 31:55.581
WE'RE GLAD WE DIDN'T
HAVE TO CONTACT

31:55.614 --> 31:58.550
ANY OF YOUR FAMILY
IN CALIFORNIA.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.286
I KNOW THAT WOULD'VE
BEEN HARD ON YOU

32:00.319 --> 32:01.687
THE WAY THIS SORT
OF THING LOOKS.

32:01.720 --> 32:04.523
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CALL THEM.

32:04.556 --> 32:06.458
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

32:06.492 --> 32:09.695
YOU ASKED ME TO COME IN,
HERE I AM.

32:12.398 --> 32:14.633
I WANNA WATCH YOU LOGIN.

32:20.639 --> 32:23.976
MAKE SURE THERE'S
NO FUNNY BUSINESS.

32:24.010 --> 32:27.713
OKAY.

32:27.746 --> 32:29.748
YOU SURE YOU WANT ME
TO SHOW HIM WHAT'S ON HERE?

32:29.781 --> 32:32.618
START TYPING.

32:43.462 --> 32:45.264
( knocking )

32:46.598 --> 32:48.067
HEY.

32:48.100 --> 32:50.036
I GOT YOUR S.O.S.
WHAT'S WRONG?

32:50.069 --> 32:52.071
PLEASE TELL ME YOU KNOW HOW
TO HACK INTO COMPUTERS.

32:52.104 --> 32:53.672
UH, NO.

32:53.705 --> 32:55.174
THAT'S WHAT
CALEB WAS FOR.

32:55.207 --> 32:57.443
WELL, CALEB IS AT THE
POLICE STATION RIGHT NOW

32:57.476 --> 32:59.311
COOPERATING WITH THIS
WHOLE INVESTIGATION.

32:59.345 --> 33:01.180
UNLESS WE FIGURE OUT HOW
TO HACK INTO HIS HARD DRIVE

33:01.213 --> 33:05.084
AND DELETE ALL THE FILES
"A" PLANTED, HE'S SCREWED.

33:05.117 --> 33:07.786
OKAY. DO YOU
KNOW HIS PASSWORD?

33:07.819 --> 33:11.223
( sighs )
I DID.

33:11.257 --> 33:13.359
THAT WASN'T AN OLD JOINT
YOUR MOTHER FOUND.

33:13.392 --> 33:16.395
IT WASN'T A NEW JOINT,
IT JUST WASN'T THAT OLD.

33:16.428 --> 33:18.630
WHY WOULD YOU LIE TO ME?

33:18.664 --> 33:20.799
I'M A GUEST IN THIS HOUSE
AND MY TEAMMATES--

33:20.832 --> 33:22.134
OH, GOD, PLEASE.

33:22.168 --> 33:23.502
NO MORE ABOUT
THE TEAMMATES.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.037
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THEM?

33:25.071 --> 33:27.606
NOTHING, NOTHING.
THEY'RE PERFECT.

33:27.639 --> 33:29.041
MAYA.

33:29.075 --> 33:30.576
YOU'RE BETTER
AT FITTING IN THAN I AM.

33:30.609 --> 33:32.511
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T
CARE ABOUT THAT.

33:32.544 --> 33:35.414
YEAH, WELL,
I'M PRETTY CONVINCING.

33:35.447 --> 33:37.816
LISTEN, WE CAN STILL
TALK TO YOUR PARENTS.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.418
I WON'T GO BACK
TO TRUE NORTH.

33:39.451 --> 33:40.519
WE'LL WORK IT OUT.

33:40.552 --> 33:42.088
NO WAY I'M
GOING BACK THERE.

33:43.489 --> 33:45.691
I'VE GOT FRIENDS
IN SAN FRANCISCO.

33:45.724 --> 33:47.326
YOU CAN'T JUST RUN AWAY.

33:47.359 --> 33:49.595
YOU COULD COME WITH ME.

33:52.198 --> 33:53.365
I CAN'T DO THAT.

33:53.399 --> 33:55.201
NOT EVEN FOR ME?

34:01.373 --> 34:04.510
NO, I GUESS YOU COULDN'T.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.678
NOT WITH THE TEAM
COUNTING ON YOU.

34:13.252 --> 34:16.222
( street noise )

34:16.255 --> 34:19.056
( phone chimes )

34:47.152 --> 34:49.155
OF EVERY CITY
HE'S EVER LIVED IN.

34:49.188 --> 34:52.190
SEATTLE, WILMETTE,
SALT LAKE,

34:52.224 --> 34:53.625
DENVER, ALLENTOWN,
ROSEWOOD.

34:53.659 --> 34:55.327
IN THAT ORDER?

34:55.360 --> 34:58.730
YES. OH, AND HE ALTERNATES
CAPITAL AND LOWER CASE LETTERS.

34:58.764 --> 35:01.467
WOW THIS IS ALMOST AS
COMPLICATED AS MY PASSWORD.

35:01.500 --> 35:02.901
ANY PUNCTUATION?

35:02.934 --> 35:07.573
YES! AN EXCLAMATION POINT
AFTER THE LAST FOUR NUMBERS.

35:07.606 --> 35:09.241
LAST FOUR NUMBERS?

35:09.275 --> 35:10.509
THERE ARE FOUR
MORE NUMBERS?

35:10.542 --> 35:11.577
OKAY, WHAT ARE THEY?

35:13.379 --> 35:15.347
Ref: READY. GO!

35:18.417 --> 35:20.286
( crowd cheering )

35:20.319 --> 35:21.553
THAT IS POINT THIS SIDE.

35:21.587 --> 35:23.121
READY--

35:30.196 --> 35:32.598
( beeps, whirrs )

35:32.631 --> 35:34.600
STAND OVER THERE.

35:34.633 --> 35:35.701
GO.

35:45.244 --> 35:48.180
WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE?
I DON'T KNOW!

35:48.214 --> 35:50.249
WE ONLY HAVE ONE MORE TRY UNTIL
WE'RE LOCKED OUT OF THE SYSTEM.

35:50.282 --> 35:51.883
JUST THINK, HANNA!
I AM THINKING!

35:51.917 --> 35:54.786
THIS IS ME THINKING!
AND MOLTING!

35:54.820 --> 35:56.822
YOU SAID,
1, 1, SOMETHING, 5.

35:56.855 --> 35:59.191
1, 1, SOMETHING, 5.
1, 1, SOMETHING--

35:59.225 --> 36:00.392
THAT IS NOT HELPING!

36:00.426 --> 36:02.661
IS IT A-- A CODE?
IS IT A DATE?

36:02.694 --> 36:04.663
OR PART OF A PHONE NUMBER?

36:04.696 --> 36:08.600
IS IT A BIRTHDAY?
IS IT AN ANNIVERSARY? OR--

36:19.345 --> 36:21.213
( gasps )
OH, MY GOD!

36:51.410 --> 36:53.412
Hanna: THERE ARE MILLION
 FILES ON HERE.

36:53.445 --> 36:55.814
IT'S LIKE LOOKING
INSIDE OF HIS BRAIN.

36:55.847 --> 36:59.351
WHICH ONE IS IT?

36:59.385 --> 37:00.952
IT'S GOTTA BE HEFTY.

CREDIT CARD INFORMATION.

37:08.727 --> 37:09.695

37:09.728 --> 37:11.397
SPENCE,
HOW MUCH IS ON HERE?

37:11.430 --> 37:13.565
SOMEBODY WHO REALLY WANTS
CALEB OUT OF THEIR WAY.

37:22.941 --> 37:24.843
I SAID, BREAK!

37:24.876 --> 37:27.813

JUST CONTROL, A.

37:49.435 --> 37:50.802

37:59.878 --> 38:03.415

38:07.018 --> 38:08.987
WHY ARE THE FILES
DISAPPEARING?
WHAT'D YOU DO?

38:09.020 --> 38:10.556
NOTHING!
I JUST CLICKED ON IT!

38:13.024 --> 38:15.761
YOU MUST'VE DONE SOMETHING.
TYPED IN A CODE, OR, OR--

38:15.794 --> 38:17.529
I TOLD YOU.
I WAS HACKED.

38:17.563 --> 38:18.997
PROBABLY GOT
A VIRUS OR SOMETHING.

38:19.030 --> 38:20.632
( martial arts yells )

38:23.669 --> 38:25.837
( crowd cheering )

38:27.406 --> 38:28.707
Ref: BACK TO THE LINE.

38:31.677 --> 38:34.580

38:55.066 --> 38:56.402

38:59.471 --> 39:01.106
DIDN'T YOU HAVE A DATE?

39:01.139 --> 39:03.141
WE RESCHEDULED.

39:03.174 --> 39:05.544
I'M NOT USED
TO HAVING AN AUDIENCE.

39:05.577 --> 39:07.112
IT'S NICE.

39:07.145 --> 39:08.480
MAYBE YOU CAN
COME TO THE NEXT--

39:08.514 --> 39:09.881
NO. THANK YOU.

39:09.915 --> 39:12.150
YOU WERE AMAZING.

39:12.183 --> 39:14.520
I STILL THINK YOU'RE
AN IDIOT THOUGH.

39:14.553 --> 39:18.657
LOOK, I GET NOT WANTING
TO ROT IN FRONT OF THE TV,

39:18.690 --> 39:21.893
BUT THIS...

39:21.927 --> 39:23.929
THIS CAN'T BE WHAT
THE DOCTOR ORDERED.

39:23.962 --> 39:27.433
NO, HE RECOMMENDED GARDENING.
THIS IS BETTER.

39:27.466 --> 39:29.868
( phone rings )

39:36.107 --> 39:39.177
DAD. HEY, WHAT'S UP?

39:39.210 --> 39:42.548
YEAH, YEAH, I'M JUST

39:42.581 --> 39:46.418
YEAH, I KNOW, SORRY.
IT'S KIND OF LOUD IN HERE.

39:46.452 --> 39:49.621
UM, SURE.

39:49.655 --> 39:51.723
HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.

39:53.892 --> 39:55.861
HI, MR. MONTGOMERY.

39:55.894 --> 39:59.931
YEAH, I-- I'M SORRY
TO BOTHER YOU.

39:59.965 --> 40:03.101
ELLA JUST THOUGHT SHE
LOST YOUR MOM'S NUMBER.

40:03.134 --> 40:04.803
THANKS. OKAY.

40:04.836 --> 40:06.738
YEAH, YOU TOO, HOLDEN.

40:10.942 --> 40:13.879
( pop music plays )

40:25.924 --> 40:27.859
DID IT.

40:27.893 --> 40:28.994

40:29.027 --> 40:31.563
1105? NOVEMBER 5th?

40:31.597 --> 40:32.931
YOU COULDN'T HAVE
JUST TOLD ME

40:32.964 --> 40:34.633
THAT IT WAS THE
NIGHT THAT WE--

40:34.666 --> 40:36.835
YOU KNOW.

40:36.868 --> 40:41.507
HANNA, THERE'S
AN EXCLAMATION POINT.

40:54.052 --> 40:55.987
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

40:56.021 --> 41:00.225
NO. LET'S THROW IT IN HIS
FACE A LITTLE LONGER.

41:16.007 --> 41:18.877
( knocking )

41:32.924 --> 41:34.860
HE'S NOT HERE.

41:34.893 --> 41:35.994
I KNOW.

41:36.027 --> 41:38.730
I CHECKED FOR HIS CAR.

41:38.764 --> 41:39.965
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU.

41:42.901 --> 41:45.837
( distant train whistle )

41:48.774 --> 41:53.078
LOOK, IF I
SCREWED UP BEFORE,

41:53.111 --> 41:54.312
I AM SORRY.

41:54.345 --> 41:55.914
I DON'T REALLY HAVE
AN ETIQUETTE BOOK

41:55.947 --> 41:57.115
FOR HOW PEOPLE
IN OUR SITUATION

41:57.148 --> 41:59.117
ARE SUPPOSED TO
TREAT EACH OTHER.

41:59.150 --> 42:00.919
I'M THE ONE
WHO'S SORRY.

42:00.952 --> 42:02.688
YOU ARE?

42:02.721 --> 42:07.759
BECAUSE YOU WERE
RIGHT, SPENCER.

42:07.793 --> 42:10.161
I DON'T WANNA FIND OUT ALI WAS
BLACKMAILING SOMEONE ELSE.

42:10.195 --> 42:11.830
I WANT IT TO BE HIM.

42:11.863 --> 42:13.264
BECAUSE?

42:13.298 --> 42:17.335
BECAUSE THAT WOULD MAKE
THINGS SO MUCH EASIER.

42:17.368 --> 42:21.707
BUT THERE'S REALLY NOTHING
EASY ABOUT THIS, IS THERE?

42:21.740 --> 42:25.744
NO, NOT SO FAR.

42:25.777 --> 42:27.713
YOU KNOW WHY WE ACT
LIKE THIS, DON'T YOU?

42:27.746 --> 42:31.583
WHY THE TWO OF US ALWAYS
SEEMS TO BE FACING OFF?

42:31.617 --> 42:34.252
BECAUSE WE'RE WIRED THE SAME.

42:38.890 --> 42:41.727
I THINK I KNOW WHY
ALI NEEDED THAT MONEY.

42:41.760 --> 42:43.829
AT LEAST A PART OF IT.

42:43.862 --> 42:45.263
WHY?

42:45.296 --> 42:47.365
SHE WAS LOOKING
FOR SOMEONE.

42:47.398 --> 42:49.034
SOMEONE THAT SHE
WAS AFRAID OF.

42:49.067 --> 42:50.936
WHO?

42:50.969 --> 42:52.370
I THINK THAT
I CAN FIND THAT OUT,

42:52.403 --> 42:55.841
BUT I'M GOING TO NEED
YOU TO TRUST ME, A LOT.

42:55.874 --> 42:57.375
A LOT?

42:57.408 --> 43:01.713
$2,000 WORTH.

43:05.250 --> 43:07.686
( answering machine beeps )

43:07.719 --> 43:10.622
MAYA, WE HAVE TO FIX THIS.

43:10.656 --> 43:14.359
I FEEL SICK ABOUT
FIGHTING WITH YOU.

43:14.392 --> 43:16.962
PLEASE CALL.

43:16.995 --> 43:20.699
OKAY. DON'T DO ANYTHING
UNTIL WE TALK.

43:22.901 --> 43:25.603
I LOVE YOU.
