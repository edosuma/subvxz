02:06.718 --> 02:07.919
JULIE: No.

02:07.953 --> 02:10.489
What if you've been hounding me for like over a year?

02:12.057 --> 02:13.792
[chuckles]

02:13.825 --> 02:16.795
I'm serious. An actual lipstick carousel?

02:18.196 --> 02:19.631
I found it on a state sale.

02:19.664 --> 02:22.801
I told you it was gonna be a blessing to move up here.

02:22.834 --> 02:24.970
I still need to check the state of the motor

02:25.003 --> 02:26.838
but it's in pretty good shape.

02:26.872 --> 02:28.406
I'll text you some pictures.

02:28.440 --> 02:31.243
Or, you know, you could use it as an excuse

02:31.276 --> 02:32.744
to come up and see the house.

02:32.777 --> 02:35.881
Well, you got to come up and visit sometime.

02:35.914 --> 02:37.716
I'm telling you, this house...

02:37.749 --> 02:40.318
something about it just drew me to it.

02:40.352 --> 02:43.655
Okay, yeah. I gotta go. I'll text you pictures later.

03:44.149 --> 03:45.650
Yeah. I tried calling you.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.419
Oh yeah. No, sorry, we just--

03:47.452 --> 03:51.356
ah, it's just plumbing Armageddon situation.

03:54.859 --> 03:56.027
CONSTRUCTION SUPERVISOR: It's not great.

03:56.061 --> 03:58.563
The amount of rock that I can see in the sub floor--

03:58.597 --> 04:00.565
The drain's probably been leaking for years.

04:00.599 --> 04:02.667
And they didn't find any of that in the inspection?

04:02.701 --> 04:04.169
CONSTRUCTION SUPERVISOR: They probably missed it.

04:04.202 --> 04:06.004
But look we can handle the re-pipe.

04:06.037 --> 04:07.739
But you're gonna need a structural engineer

04:07.772 --> 04:08.974
to take a look at that floor.

04:09.007 --> 04:10.675
JULIE: Anyone you recommend?

04:15.947 --> 04:17.716
Yeah, so that's my day.

04:40.639 --> 04:43.408
As soon as we finish one thing, something else explodes

04:43.441 --> 04:45.043
or rots or leaks.

04:45.076 --> 04:47.846
It's like we're living in a in a never-ending game of the--

04:47.879 --> 04:49.581
you know what's the thing where it pops up and you--

04:49.614 --> 04:50.582
-Whack-A-Mole? -DANIEL: ...and you whack 'em.

04:50.615 --> 04:52.417
You sure it's a Whack-A-Mole?

Is that the guy with the moustache?

No, no, that's Barkley. That's uh... that's the chair.

09:29.961 --> 09:32.530
So, tell me how did you two meet?

09:32.564 --> 09:34.599
We met the old-fashioned way.

09:34.632 --> 09:35.500
-Yeah... -We met at a bar.

09:35.533 --> 09:36.834
Right.

09:36.868 --> 09:39.137
I was out one night having drinks with friends

09:39.170 --> 09:42.173
and I spot this guy alone, sitting at the bar.

09:42.206 --> 09:44.008
I just got in the country and so I was...

09:44.042 --> 09:46.978
So, he finally works up the nerve to come over

09:47.011 --> 09:48.146
and he offers to buy me a drink.

09:48.179 --> 09:50.281
Well, I actually bought a round of drinks for her

09:50.315 --> 09:51.382
and her mates.

09:51.416 --> 09:52.684
-It was all a trap.... -[Mrs. Whittier chuckles]

09:52.717 --> 09:55.486
Which was a rather steep investment on my part

09:55.520 --> 09:56.487
-during that time. -Oh, okay.

09:56.521 --> 09:57.755
Apparently, I was worth the splurge.

09:57.789 --> 09:59.624
DANIEL: Well, apparently. I was a little tipsy.

09:59.657 --> 10:01.059
-And we get to talking. -That's right,

10:01.092 --> 10:03.528
and she tells me about her antiques business, right?

10:03.561 --> 10:04.696
Hm-mm.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.631
And, he mentions this old watch he has

10:06.664 --> 10:08.533
and he's been meaning to get it restored.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.401
So, I said I'd take a look at it.

10:10.435 --> 10:12.136
Which was a lie, of course.

10:12.170 --> 10:13.938
-There was no watch. -No watch.

10:13.972 --> 10:15.306
And I just wanted to see her again.

10:15.340 --> 10:18.977
So, I spend the next 24 hours scouring all of lower Manhattan

10:19.010 --> 10:21.746
trying to find a watch. I find one, I bring it to her.

10:21.779 --> 10:23.081
-Total fake. -Total fake.

10:23.114 --> 10:23.781
JULIE: Hm-mm.

10:23.815 --> 10:25.617
It wasn't my proudest moment,

10:25.650 --> 10:26.884
-but still works. -[Julie chuckles]

11:09.527 --> 11:11.729
My downfall was always the cheese.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.565
So, where'd you end up settling?

11:14.599 --> 11:16.601
We bought a house by the lake.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.202
Oh, it's stunning up there.

11:18.236 --> 11:19.771
John and I have toyed with the idea

11:19.804 --> 11:21.105
of moving up there for years.

11:21.139 --> 11:24.342
-Which property? -8317 Lake view.

11:24.375 --> 11:25.777
Oh yes.

11:25.810 --> 11:28.246
I knew a man who lived up there many years ago.

11:28.279 --> 11:31.249
Unfortunately, his wife became quite ill.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.285
Anyway, you must be over the moon.

11:56.274 --> 12:00.445
I mean, I'm telling you Jules, there's a real opportunity here.

12:00.478 --> 12:01.312
I'm gonna play my cards right

12:01.345 --> 12:03.481
and I could be running the department

12:03.514 --> 12:05.750

12:22.633 --> 12:24.769
[scoffs] What would you have me say?

12:25.970 --> 12:28.906
I passed it as an exactly cocktail conversation, Jules.

12:28.940 --> 12:30.274
You don't have to lie about it.

12:30.308 --> 12:31.876
Well, she asked a simple question.

12:31.909 --> 12:33.945
I... I gave a simple answer.

12:33.978 --> 12:35.546
[scoffs] Right.

God forbid, you upset our fancy new friends.

12:46.157 --> 12:47.525
people that were way before,

12:47.558 --> 12:49.627
that know what we went through.

12:49.660 --> 12:52.930
I mean, isn't this meant to be a fresh start for us?

12:52.964 --> 12:54.632
You know, giving this a fresh go.

12:54.665 --> 12:55.767
How are we gonna do that,

12:55.800 --> 12:57.068
if we're just clinging on to the past?

12:58.069 --> 12:59.537
Daniel, he was your son.

It's like sometimes you forget he even existed!

13:02.473 --> 13:04.208

No. Jules, please stop. Please, just talk to me. Wait.

14:31.529 --> 14:33.264
Hey.

14:33.297 --> 14:34.265
Hey.

14:36.167 --> 14:37.335
You're in the hospital.

14:38.903 --> 14:40.037
You had a bad fall.

14:40.972 --> 14:42.540
-Is she.... -She's okay.

14:44.308 --> 14:45.209
Baby's okay.

14:49.380 --> 14:52.750
You suffered what we call a partial placenta abruption.

14:52.783 --> 14:55.219
Abruption? What's that?

14:55.253 --> 14:57.221
It's when the placenta becomes partially detached

14:57.255 --> 14:58.589
from the uterine wall.

14:58.623 --> 15:00.258
Is it dangerous?

15:00.291 --> 15:03.661
Well, it can be life-threatening if the placenta fully separates

15:03.694 --> 15:07.765
but as you can see, the tear appears fairly minimal.

15:08.466 --> 15:11.068
And so far the situation seems to be stabilized.

15:11.102 --> 15:12.303
Bleeding stopped

15:12.336 --> 15:14.038
and your baby's got a good strong heartbeat.

15:16.440 --> 15:20.077
However, it is standard practice to exercise caution.

15:21.178 --> 15:22.380
What does that mean?

15:24.849 --> 15:27.418
It means I want you on bed rest.

15:27.451 --> 15:30.454
Strict bed rest for the duration of your pregnancy.

15:30.488 --> 15:34.025
No driving, no lifting, no cooking.

15:34.058 --> 15:36.594
Other than the occasional trip to the bathroom,

15:36.627 --> 15:38.329
you need to be in bed idle.

15:40.231 --> 15:42.767
You're saying you want me in bed

15:42.800 --> 15:44.068
for the next eight weeks?

15:45.202 --> 15:47.104
DR. MEADOWS: I know it's not ideal.

15:47.138 --> 15:49.273
But we don't want you going into early labor.

15:49.307 --> 15:52.009
Anything before 37 weeks is considered preterm

15:52.043 --> 15:54.178
and can put the baby at risk of low birth weight

15:54.211 --> 15:56.213
or respiratory distress.

15:56.247 --> 15:57.682
We're in the middle of a renovation

15:57.715 --> 15:59.817
and we're overseeing everything.

15:59.850 --> 16:01.018
I would strongly recommend

16:01.052 --> 16:03.254
putting any major projects on hold,

16:03.287 --> 16:04.588
until after the baby comes.

16:07.024 --> 16:08.326
Do you have any family or friends in the area?

16:08.359 --> 16:10.094
Anyone who can help you out?

16:10.127 --> 16:11.996
Not since we moved, no.

16:12.029 --> 16:12.964

16:12.997 --> 16:14.432
we'd be happy to offer a referral.

16:17.868 --> 16:18.736

16:32.316 --> 16:33.517
DR. MEADOWS: To avoid preterm labor,

16:33.551 --> 16:35.553
you need to follow a few simple rules.

16:36.487 --> 16:39.223
One, you need to remain in bed 24 hours a day.

16:40.324 --> 16:42.326
Two, you're allowed brief trips to the bathroom

16:42.360 --> 16:45.062
and one ten-minute bath every three days,

16:45.096 --> 16:46.197
no more.

16:47.398 --> 16:49.734
And finally, the most important rule.

16:50.434 --> 16:52.370
It's crucial that you avoid stress.

16:53.471 --> 16:55.306
Anything that raises your blood pressure

16:55.339 --> 16:57.708
not only endangers the health of your child,

16:57.742 --> 17:00.011
but could re trigger the mental dissociation

17:00.044 --> 17:01.746
you experienced after your last pregnancy.

17:03.481 --> 17:06.283

Would you uh...

Julie, no one ever said that bed rest would be easy.

46:27.109 --> 46:28.544

Especially for someone like me.

46:36.652 --> 46:38.287
As I see it, we have two options.

46:39.655 --> 46:41.190
We can move you to the hospital.

46:41.223 --> 46:43.459
That would allow to finish your pregnancy

46:43.492 --> 46:44.426
under the supervision

46:44.460 --> 46:46.061
of a highly qualified medical staff. Two--

46:46.095 --> 46:47.029
No.

46:50.466 --> 46:52.134
No more hospitals.

46:52.168 --> 46:54.370
DR. MEADOWS: The other option is you remain here at home.

46:54.403 --> 46:57.740
My caveat being you have to restart your medication.

46:57.773 --> 46:59.375
What about the baby?

46:59.408 --> 47:01.877
DR. MEADOWS: You are 35 weeks along.

47:01.911 --> 47:03.946
The meds would have little to no impact

47:03.979 --> 47:05.815
on your baby's development.

47:05.848 --> 47:08.284
Right now, the most important thing

47:45.387 --> 47:48.190
to a more significant psychological break.

And she clearly thinks

47:49.258 --> 47:51.227
she's seeing your previous child.

The medication should alleviate her symptoms,

47:52.962 --> 47:55.898
but if they do persist,

47:55.931 --> 47:57.166

JULIE: He's trying to warn us about Delmy.

55:41.830 --> 55:45.334
-What are you talking about? -She wants our baby.

55:45.367 --> 55:46.501

55:58.880 --> 56:01.650

56:03.418 --> 56:05.153
I was the one that held him!

56:06.455 --> 56:08.490
Praying for him to breathe.

56:10.859 --> 56:13.628
So, you don't have to tell me that he's dead, Daniel.

You're seeing our dead son, Julie.

So, just for a second here.

I could really use your support right now.

1:00:12.601 --> 1:00:14.135
Pregnancy was going alone fine

1:00:14.169 --> 1:00:16.671

1:00:18.073 --> 1:00:21.076
An incompetent cervix. That's what they told me.

1:00:23.044 --> 1:00:24.713
I managed to conceive three more times

1:00:24.746 --> 1:00:26.715
but never carried any to term.

1:00:27.882 --> 1:00:30.185
I felt so hollow, so alone,

1:00:30.218 --> 1:00:34.923
kept... asking myself what I'd done to deserve it.

1:00:36.958 --> 1:00:39.361
And I remembered a story I'd heard as a child.

1:00:39.394 --> 1:00:41.830
About a family who lived up around this lake.

1:00:43.431 --> 1:00:44.366
Three small kids,

1:00:45.533 --> 1:00:46.701
mother pregnant with the fourth.

1:00:48.169 --> 1:00:51.373
She and her husband were on the way to the hospital

1:00:51.406 --> 1:00:54.476
in early labor when their car skidded on some ice.

1:00:54.509 --> 1:00:55.777
Crashed into a tree.

1:00:57.779 --> 1:01:00.248
The impact taking the life of their unborn daughter.

1:01:01.916 --> 1:01:03.852
The woman was inconsolable.

1:01:03.885 --> 1:01:06.054
Every night, her cries could be heard

1:01:06.087 --> 1:01:07.822
around the lake lamenting the loss

1:01:07.856 --> 1:01:10.058
of her baby girl.

1:01:10.091 --> 1:01:13.061
She didn't eat, barely left the house.

1:01:13.094 --> 1:01:15.096
The faces of her three living children

1:01:15.130 --> 1:01:20.235
just reminded her how she'd failed as a mother.

1:01:20.268 --> 1:01:22.937
How she could never truly protect them.

1:01:24.973 --> 1:01:27.976
And eventually, it just became too much.

1:01:28.710 --> 1:01:30.078
She took her own life?

1:01:37.385 --> 1:01:41.823
That story reminded me that I wasn't alone.

1:01:43.425 --> 1:01:45.460
That mothers have been bearing the burden of loss

1:01:45.493 --> 1:01:46.961
