WEBVTT

00:00.800 --> 00:02.534
Clear!

00:04.104 --> 00:07.539
Continue. Charging, 360.
Charge to 360.

00:07.575 --> 00:08.741
Clear!

00:12.346 --> 00:14.413
Continue. Charging, 360.

00:16.417 --> 00:17.383
Clear!

00:17.418 --> 00:19.318
Clear.

00:25.426 --> 00:26.859
Come on. Come on!

00:28.596 --> 00:29.762
Asystole.

00:36.971 --> 00:38.704
I'm gonna call it.
Any objections?

00:41.542 --> 00:44.243
18:20.

00:44.278 --> 00:45.611
He was looking at me.

00:47.348 --> 00:48.947
He didn't want to die.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.954
Just shooting hoops. Some guys
drove by and popped him.

00:57.958 --> 01:00.759
I'm sorry about that, dr. Choi.

01:00.795 --> 01:02.695
Goodwin just paged.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.495
She wants to discuss
your request.

01:06.534 --> 01:08.534
Hey. I'm taking off. You coming?

01:08.569 --> 01:10.280
No. I just got to wait
for rita to get here.

01:10.304 --> 01:11.270
You go ahead.

01:11.305 --> 01:12.738
All right.

01:14.975 --> 01:16.942
See you tomorrow. Yeah. See you.

01:21.015 --> 01:22.514
Aren't you taking off?

01:22.550 --> 01:24.950
Nah. Pulling another shift.

01:24.985 --> 01:26.618
Malpractice premiums are due.

01:26.654 --> 01:28.354
Maybe it'll be an easy night.

01:28.389 --> 01:30.089
Don't jinx it.

01:31.826 --> 01:33.359
I look at her
as just another patient.

01:33.394 --> 01:35.027
But clearly she isn't.

01:35.062 --> 01:37.296
If there's a bad outcome,

01:37.331 --> 01:40.566
Does this thing become
an international incident?

01:40.601 --> 01:42.334
We have consent
from all parties.

01:42.370 --> 01:43.869
The state department's
been apprised.

01:45.673 --> 01:49.375
You know, there is
a potential upside to this,

01:49.410 --> 01:51.477
As long as you pull it off,

01:51.512 --> 01:52.878
So, all right.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.646
Let's keep it under wraps.

01:54.682 --> 01:57.750
Everyone involved signs
a non-disclosure.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.485
Yes, ma'am.

02:02.757 --> 02:04.690
Dr. Halstead,
incoming times three.

02:04.725 --> 02:06.392
One, two, and three are
all open.

02:06.427 --> 02:07.326
Desmond?

02:07.361 --> 02:09.428
15-year-old male,
extremely combative.

02:09.463 --> 02:10.774
Trashed our ambo
on the ride over.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.664
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

02:12.700 --> 02:13.732
No way to get vitals.

02:13.768 --> 02:16.435
Managed to stick him
with 5 of versed, but no effect.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.603
Looks like pcp maybe.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.571
Got two more
in the ambo behind ours.

02:19.607 --> 02:21.373
10 of haldol im.

02:21.409 --> 02:22.541
The other two like this?

02:22.576 --> 02:23.920
I think they all took
the same thing.

02:23.944 --> 02:26.345
All right.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.013
They're here.

02:28.048 --> 02:29.715
Wheeler, stay with them.
Clarke with me.

02:29.750 --> 02:33.018
Okay, watch his feet. Got it.

02:33.053 --> 02:34.920
"Easy night." she jinxed it.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.855
Cesar? 15-year-old boy.

02:36.891 --> 02:37.723
He seized on the ride over.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.925
But responded well
to 5 of versed im.

02:39.960 --> 02:40.859
We intubated en route.

02:40.895 --> 02:42.761
All right. Abcs.
Check the tube placement,

02:42.797 --> 02:44.129
Get a quick exam, ativan drip,

02:44.165 --> 02:45.531
Then send him for head ct.

02:45.566 --> 02:48.767
Got it. Watch the lines.

02:48.803 --> 02:50.869
Courtney? Gave her 5 of versed.

02:50.905 --> 02:53.038
In the ambo,
but didn't stop the seizing.

02:53.073 --> 02:54.985
Have her on oxygen,
but couldn't give her much else.

02:55.009 --> 02:57.743
All right, maggie, cbc, cmp,
and blood gas on all three.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.156
Send blood and urine
for a tox screen.

02:59.180 --> 03:01.380
Copy that. On my count.

03:01.415 --> 03:02.948
One, two, three.

03:04.185 --> 03:06.585
Let's get an iv in and an npa.
Yes, doctor.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.889
On it.

03:10.925 --> 03:12.758
All right.

03:12.793 --> 03:13.926
He's 90 over 60.

03:13.961 --> 03:16.995
Heart rate heavy.

03:17.031 --> 03:19.498
Okay, let's move him.
Okay, here we go.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.899
She's protecting her airway.

03:24.939 --> 03:26.905
Thank you.

03:26.941 --> 03:28.440
Okay, we're in.

03:29.477 --> 03:30.576
Sat of 97%.

03:30.611 --> 03:32.778
All right. Let's take
advantage of her postictal state.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.179
And get her head scanned.

03:34.215 --> 03:36.949
Hey, bring ativan with you.

03:39.787 --> 03:42.654
Coming through. Watch your back.

03:42.690 --> 03:44.923
Look alive, dr. Halstead.

03:44.959 --> 03:46.670
It's a broad presentation.
Are we sure they're all.

03:46.694 --> 03:47.459
On the same thing?

03:47.495 --> 03:49.127
Till we get tox screens,
who knows?

03:51.000 --> 03:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:00.607 --> 04:04.209
<i>I hope you don't mind
that I'm dating your boyfriend.</i>

04:04.245 --> 04:06.879
<i>No. Course not. Go to fresch co.</i>

04:06.914 --> 04:08.080
<i>Why would I mind?</i>

04:08.115 --> 04:09.982
<i>Can we still be friends?</i>

04:10.017 --> 04:12.951
<i>Sure.
I'll be your maid of honor.</i>

04:16.089 --> 04:18.190
So, what do you think?

04:18.225 --> 04:20.358
Well, I don't understand
why that woman doesn't mind.

04:20.394 --> 04:22.027
Her friend betrayed her.

04:23.964 --> 04:26.031
You sure she doesn't mind?

04:26.066 --> 04:27.499
She said she didn't.

04:29.570 --> 04:32.037
So, after reading
the material I gave you,

04:32.072 --> 04:34.406
You told me that you suspected...

04:34.442 --> 04:35.908
That I'm on the autism spectrum,

04:35.943 --> 04:37.042
That I have asperger's.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.010
Right.

04:38.045 --> 04:40.379
So, how'd you feel
if I told you that I thought.

04:40.414 --> 04:44.383
That your diagnosis could
very well be correct?

04:44.418 --> 04:46.351
Relieved, actually.

04:46.387 --> 04:47.920
My whole life,
I've never understood.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.888
Why people treated me
the way they did.

04:49.924 --> 04:52.558
I felt there had to be
something wrong with me.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.126
Not wrong.

04:54.161 --> 04:56.562
I mean, it's just different
wiring. That's all.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.897
Is there anything we can do
to change that wiring?

04:58.933 --> 05:00.444
Well, our wiring is
pretty much our wiring,

05:00.468 --> 05:02.401
But there's a whole bevy
of strategies out there.

05:02.436 --> 05:05.938
I mean, medications,
social skills training.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.407
To help you recognize
body language.

05:08.442 --> 05:11.410
There's also a new therapy
called tms,

05:11.445 --> 05:13.445
But I'd probably recommend
you going.

05:13.481 --> 05:14.624
The traditional routes first.

05:14.648 --> 05:15.948
Tms?

05:15.983 --> 05:18.484
Transcranial magnetic
stimulation.

05:18.519 --> 05:21.320
It's so far fda approved
only for depression,

05:21.355 --> 05:23.088
But there is anecdotal evidence.

05:23.123 --> 05:25.958
That it can benefit people
with spectrum disorders.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.604
I only mention it
because we have a machine.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.428
Here at the hospital.

05:29.463 --> 05:33.065
Well, I will do some research.

05:34.368 --> 05:36.502
I am needed in the or. Yes.

05:36.537 --> 05:40.339
Dr. Charles, this has
all been very comforting.

05:40.374 --> 05:41.406
Thank you.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.475
Of course.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.122
Hey, maggie? Hey.

05:57.157 --> 05:59.525
Rita just called.
She came down with the flu.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.760
We're gonna be short tonight.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.695
I know what that means.
Another shift.

06:03.731 --> 06:06.198
Well, think how much money
you'll be making.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.300
Ms. Goodwin? Yes?

06:08.335 --> 06:09.234
The patient's arriving.

06:09.270 --> 06:11.537
Okay. Bring her up
through the loading dock.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.372
And use the service elevator.
Sure.

06:13.407 --> 06:15.541
Loading dock?

06:15.576 --> 06:17.342
I'll tell you later.

06:17.378 --> 06:19.311
Okay.

06:19.346 --> 06:21.380
Crows!

06:21.415 --> 06:23.448
Get them away!
5 of haldol, please.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.183
They're in the... it's all right.

06:25.219 --> 06:27.130
We're taking care of those.
They're in the house!

06:27.154 --> 06:28.787
No, no, no.
We're taking care of those.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.789
We're taking care of those.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.491
We're taking care of those
right now.

06:32.526 --> 06:35.027
There you go.

06:37.031 --> 06:39.164
There we go.

06:39.199 --> 06:40.532
Okay.

06:42.369 --> 06:43.813
You know two out of three
patients in here.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.737
End up developing delirium?

06:45.773 --> 06:47.739
From the fever?
She has pneumonia.

06:47.775 --> 06:49.341
Well, it's
a contributing factor,

06:49.376 --> 06:51.376
But it's also the icu itself.

06:51.412 --> 06:53.512
You know, bright lights,
the endless beeping,

06:53.547 --> 06:55.013
Constant prodding and poking.

06:55.049 --> 06:57.382
I mean, the woman's exhausted.
Hey, hank?

06:57.418 --> 06:59.563
Could we maybe turn the lights
down in ms. Novak's room?

06:59.587 --> 07:00.797
Maybe quiet the monitors
a little bit?

07:00.821 --> 07:02.399
Also, I don't think you need
to be going in and out of there.

07:02.423 --> 07:03.522
Every 20 minutes, okay?

07:03.557 --> 07:04.523
The woman needs some rest.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.558
Sure. Thank you.

07:11.098 --> 07:14.266
I spoke to my mom today,
told her I was a psych resident.

07:14.301 --> 07:16.335
Just now you're telling her?

07:16.370 --> 07:18.270
Yeah. I knew how she'd react.
And I was right.

07:18.305 --> 07:19.338
She laughed.

07:19.373 --> 07:21.351
She said I was the last person
she could ever imagine.

07:21.375 --> 07:22.207
Being a psychiatrist.

07:22.242 --> 07:24.710
Wow.
Real vote of confidence there.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.580
Do I get to meet
your mom someday?

07:33.420 --> 07:36.421
You seeing what I'm seeing?
Yeah.

07:36.457 --> 07:38.423
We need a ct surgeon, now.

07:38.459 --> 07:39.791
Page dr. Latham?

07:39.827 --> 07:42.260
He's in surgery. Get dr. Rhodes.

07:42.296 --> 07:43.395
He's not on call.

07:43.430 --> 07:45.864
Tell him it's an emergency.

07:49.269 --> 07:51.236
I'm puzzled by this chart,
dr. Wheeler.

07:51.271 --> 07:53.739
Did you do a rectal exam?

07:53.774 --> 07:55.774
I didn't think in this case
it was necessary.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.409
It's always necessary.

07:57.444 --> 07:58.777
It's a part
of the physical exam,

07:58.812 --> 07:59.978
And it's expected.

08:00.014 --> 08:03.148
I've seen too many things missed
because feckless residents.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.783
Don't do a complete physical.

08:11.525 --> 08:13.125
What's the troll still doing
here?

08:13.160 --> 08:15.661
Doesn't he have a bridge
somewhere to go home to?

08:15.696 --> 08:18.130
How's your boy? Still out.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.442
All right.
Cts were all negative.

08:19.466 --> 08:20.599
No swelling, no bleeds.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.567
Tox screens are also negative.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.770
Heroin, meth, cocaine.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.405
Then what?

08:26.440 --> 08:28.607
Some synthetic cannabinoid.

08:28.642 --> 08:29.819
What's your patient's
heart rate?

08:29.843 --> 08:31.443
Slow. 50.

08:31.478 --> 08:33.745
Bradycardia. Rules out mdma.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.514
See a lot of that.

08:35.549 --> 08:36.313
In the field.

08:36.350 --> 08:37.649
You think we're looking
at spice?

08:37.684 --> 08:39.418
Spice? It's fake weed.

08:39.453 --> 08:41.453
And it could be mixed
with a number of things...

08:41.488 --> 08:42.520
Flakka, krokodil.

08:42.556 --> 08:43.587
Right.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.502
None of that would show up
in a tox screen either.

08:45.526 --> 08:48.126
Nope. Well, hope one of them
comes to and tells us.

08:48.162 --> 08:50.262
Meanwhile, stay with.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.330
Benzos and fluids. Got it.

08:54.401 --> 08:57.703
Yes. Very nice.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.705
Charity event
at the art institute.

08:59.740 --> 09:03.675
Hi, maggie. Robyn.

09:03.711 --> 09:05.777
You concur?
Atrial septal defect.

09:05.813 --> 09:07.212
But you feel it's an emergency?

09:07.247 --> 09:09.548
Well, the patient's
already anesthetized.

09:09.583 --> 09:12.384
For just a ct?
Is she mentally compromised?

09:12.419 --> 09:14.286
No.

09:14.321 --> 09:17.556
Wait. This doesn't look right.

09:17.591 --> 09:20.425
The ribcage. Pectus carinatum.
Is she deformed?

09:21.695 --> 09:23.528
Come meet her.

09:23.564 --> 09:24.863
Okay.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.232
I'm really sorry about this.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.367
It's okay.

09:29.403 --> 09:30.969
I'll wait
in the doctors' lounge.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.404
Come find you in a little bit.

09:35.008 --> 09:37.409
Here he is. Dr. Rhodes.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.244
Thank you for coming in.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.646
This is mr. Hsieh
from the chinese embassy.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.849
Dr. Rhodes. Mr. Woodfield,

09:43.884 --> 09:45.817
The director of the chicago zoo.

09:45.853 --> 09:48.687
Doctor.
And the chief veterinarian,

09:48.722 --> 09:49.788
Dr. Evans.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.360
Zoo?

09:55.395 --> 09:57.462
Your patient...

10:00.868 --> 10:02.534
Meet su lin.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.700
So, this was your idea?

10:17.735 --> 10:19.935
<i>Dr. Choi volunteers
loo at the zoo.Rror.</i>

10:19.971 --> 10:21.904
Normally we wouldn't bring
an animal in here,

10:21.939 --> 10:23.605
But we couldn't diagnose
without a ct.

10:23.641 --> 10:26.108
Well, that's fine,
but I'm not a veterinarian.

10:26.143 --> 10:28.410
She needs
a cardiothoracic surgeon.

10:28.446 --> 10:30.713
You've done this procedure
many times.

10:30.748 --> 10:32.715
Yeah, I have, on human beings.

10:32.750 --> 10:34.116
Same plumbing, just bigger.

10:34.151 --> 10:35.718
Crack her chest
and plug the hole.

10:35.753 --> 10:38.721
I can't... no,
I can't just crack her chest.

10:38.756 --> 10:39.588
She'll lose too much blood,

10:39.623 --> 10:41.201
And what am I supposed
to transfuse with?

10:41.225 --> 10:43.559
Do we have panda
in the blood bank?

10:43.594 --> 10:45.761
So, how do we treat her?

10:47.932 --> 10:50.065
Um...

10:52.903 --> 10:58.741
I guess I would have to take her
up to the cath lab.

10:58.776 --> 11:03.746
And close the defect
with a balloon.

11:03.781 --> 11:06.048
Okay. Then do it.

11:08.452 --> 11:11.720
Really? Are we sure
that we're all comfortable.

11:11.756 --> 11:13.756
Spending our time
and the hospital's resources.

11:13.791 --> 11:14.990
To save an animal?

11:15.026 --> 11:19.595
Dr. Rhodes, zoos rent pandas
from the chinese government.

11:19.630 --> 11:21.930
For a million dollars a year.

11:21.966 --> 11:25.100
Why? Because people love pandas.

11:25.136 --> 11:27.603
So, if we save this one,

11:27.638 --> 11:30.506
It's a public relations coup
for this hospital...

11:30.541 --> 11:33.742
One which will lead
to much-needed donations.

11:33.778 --> 11:35.844
To save human lives.

11:35.880 --> 11:40.115
And... and there's an issue
beyond that.

11:40.151 --> 11:43.452
I've learned that there are
less than 2,000 pandas.

11:43.487 --> 11:45.187
Left in the world.

11:45.222 --> 11:47.823
Connor,

11:47.858 --> 11:50.759
We should do whatever we can
to keep her alive.

11:54.865 --> 11:57.266
One parrot,
and he's dr. Doolittle.

12:02.006 --> 12:03.972
Okay.

12:04.008 --> 12:07.076
Let's get su lin
up to the cath lab.

12:08.646 --> 12:10.012
Thank you.

12:14.685 --> 12:16.952
Hi. I'm dr. Wheeler.

12:16.987 --> 12:18.587
Do you know where you are?

12:20.224 --> 12:22.624
Do you understand?

12:22.660 --> 12:24.293
Can you tell me
how you got here?

12:25.896 --> 12:27.296
Help!

12:29.333 --> 12:31.166
Grab him. Aah! No!

12:31.202 --> 12:32.034
Get away!

12:32.069 --> 12:34.236
I got you.
5 versed, 10 of haldol im.

12:34.271 --> 12:35.571
Got it.

12:35.606 --> 12:36.872
I'll kill you!

12:39.176 --> 12:41.009
Get the restraints
back on this kid.

12:41.045 --> 12:43.145
What's wrong with him?

12:43.180 --> 12:45.747
Delirium can sometimes be
a sign of kidney failure.

12:45.783 --> 12:47.182
Happens with these drugs.

12:47.218 --> 12:49.017
The kids' parents are
on the way in.

12:49.053 --> 12:50.819
There's nothing good
to tell them.

12:55.192 --> 12:56.625
Okay, I'll be right back.

13:01.632 --> 13:03.198
She's doing much better.

13:03.234 --> 13:04.867
Very good.

13:04.902 --> 13:07.603
Well, been a long day.
I'll see you tomorrow?

13:07.638 --> 13:09.705
I volunteered
to be on call tonight.

13:09.740 --> 13:11.006
Really?

13:11.041 --> 13:13.575
Wow. I applaud your work ethic.

13:13.611 --> 13:15.210
But, um... but why?

13:15.246 --> 13:16.211
This patient.

13:16.247 --> 13:18.547
I'm afraid that once
the nurses change shifts,

13:18.582 --> 13:20.582
Our instructions won't
get passed on.

13:20.618 --> 13:22.050
I think that our excellent staff.

13:22.086 --> 13:24.052
Will probably follow through.

13:24.088 --> 13:25.198
I mean, aren't you exhausted?

13:25.222 --> 13:26.822
It's not a problem.

13:28.292 --> 13:29.725
Coffee beans?

13:29.760 --> 13:31.593
Robusto espresso beans.

13:31.629 --> 13:34.263
If I eat five an hour,
I can go all night.

13:34.298 --> 13:36.798
Got it. You know, dr. Reese,

13:36.834 --> 13:38.634
I know your mother might
have some doubts.

13:38.669 --> 13:40.903
About your future
as a psychiatrist,

13:40.938 --> 13:41.904
But I for one do not.

13:41.939 --> 13:42.905
I mean, not even a tiny bit.

13:42.940 --> 13:45.140
I'm just saying you have
nothing to prove to me.

13:45.176 --> 13:47.276
Well, it's not that.
I just want to make sure.

13:47.311 --> 13:49.089
Our patient gets the treatment
that she needs.

13:49.113 --> 13:52.247
Okay.

13:52.283 --> 13:54.082
You know, I've been meaning

13:54.118 --> 13:55.918
I recommend
to all of my residents.

13:55.953 --> 13:57.319
As part of their training.

13:57.354 --> 13:59.955
That they undergo some form
of psychotherapy.

13:59.990 --> 14:01.134
Is that something
you'd ever consider?

14:01.158 --> 14:03.258
Me? No.

14:03.294 --> 14:04.726
Well, I mean, the idea being.

14:04.762 --> 14:07.062
That it might benefit you
professionally,

14:07.097 --> 14:08.909
You know, to see what it's like
to be on the other side.

14:08.933 --> 14:10.632
I mean,
it certainly benefitted me.

14:10.668 --> 14:13.936
I really can't see myself
in psychotherapy, dr. Charles.

14:13.971 --> 14:15.270
Okay.

14:15.306 --> 14:16.972
Well, just a thought.

14:17.007 --> 14:19.241
See you in the morning.

14:23.781 --> 14:25.358
Sorry, robyn,
but it looks like it's gonna be.

14:25.382 --> 14:26.782
Kind of a long night.

14:26.817 --> 14:28.984
Tough case?

14:29.019 --> 14:31.086
On the dl... Yeah?

14:31.121 --> 14:33.255
The patient is a panda bear.

14:33.290 --> 14:34.856
A panda?

14:34.892 --> 14:36.191
Atrial septal defect.

14:36.227 --> 14:37.759
Can you fix it?

14:37.795 --> 14:38.994
Well, that's the idea.

14:39.029 --> 14:41.797
You know there are less than
2,000 pandas left in the world?

14:41.832 --> 14:43.365
Somebody mentioned that.

14:43.400 --> 14:46.935
Connor, what you are doing...
It is so great.

14:49.740 --> 14:51.873
Yeah? Yeah.

14:51.909 --> 14:53.342
Very sexy.

14:55.212 --> 14:59.314
Alpha ct surgeon
with a soft spot for animals.

15:01.185 --> 15:03.185
I'll call you a cab.
No. What? Are you kidding me?

15:03.220 --> 15:06.788
No. I am sticking around.
I love pandas.

15:06.824 --> 15:07.889
Okay. Yeah.

15:07.925 --> 15:09.057
I got to go change.

15:09.093 --> 15:10.359
Okay.

15:26.243 --> 15:28.143
This is weird.

15:28.178 --> 15:30.846
4 west needs me to come down
and declare a patient dead.

15:32.249 --> 15:33.249
What?

15:33.284 --> 15:34.216
Nobody likes that job,

15:34.251 --> 15:36.752
So they dump it
on the on-call psych resident.

15:36.787 --> 15:37.886
You.

15:43.260 --> 15:45.360
Are you clear on mrs. Novak?

15:45.396 --> 15:47.896
Yes, I'm clear.

15:47.931 --> 15:49.131
All right.

15:54.371 --> 15:55.304
It's a formality.

15:55.339 --> 15:57.272
We need a doc to call it
and tell the family.

15:57.308 --> 15:58.518
Haven't you ever done this
before?

15:58.542 --> 16:00.075
No.

16:01.045 --> 16:02.944
I'll help you. Here.

16:02.980 --> 16:05.747
Introduce yourself to the son.

16:10.387 --> 16:13.221
I'm dr. Reese.

16:13.257 --> 16:15.457
I understand you're
the patient's son.

16:15.492 --> 16:17.025
Okay.

16:18.262 --> 16:23.198
I... i am here
to check on your father.

17:06.844 --> 17:08.443
I'm afraid he's passed.

17:12.383 --> 17:14.148
22:05.

17:18.989 --> 17:20.989
I am very sorry for your loss.

17:37.541 --> 17:39.508
That was terrible.
I was terrible.

17:43.213 --> 17:44.112
Hey, what are you doing?

17:44.148 --> 17:46.982
Hospital called.
Got to go back in.

17:47.017 --> 17:49.017
What? Why?
'cause they're swamped.

17:49.052 --> 17:50.563
They need me.
Can't they get someone else?

17:50.587 --> 17:52.154
No.

17:53.424 --> 17:55.190
But it's so late,

17:55.225 --> 17:56.858
And you already worked
a full day.

17:56.894 --> 17:58.326
Yeah. I'm used to it.

17:58.362 --> 17:59.861
I don't mind.

18:01.098 --> 18:02.342
Shouldn't you be taking it easy?

18:02.366 --> 18:05.200
I mean, you know, the baby.

18:05.235 --> 18:08.170
Really, tate?
We're gonna do this again?

18:08.205 --> 18:09.516
How many times
do I have to say it?

18:09.540 --> 18:11.973
Pregnant women can work.

18:12.009 --> 18:14.042
What about pregnant women
with tb?

18:17.581 --> 18:21.216
The drugs knocked it down,
and you know that.

18:21.251 --> 18:23.518
I'm so sick of you bringing up
this work thing.

18:23.554 --> 18:25.887
I worry about you. And the baby.

18:26.623 --> 18:29.324
Well, stop. I'm good.

18:30.260 --> 18:31.560
And the baby's good.

18:33.564 --> 18:35.430
I'll see you in the morning.

18:35.466 --> 18:36.998
Yeah.

18:38.101 --> 18:40.335
I think you're
a little posterior.

18:40.370 --> 18:42.204
How's it look in flouro?

18:42.239 --> 18:43.905
Give me a view at 120.

18:43.941 --> 18:45.340
One sec.

18:48.579 --> 18:51.079
Right there. That's it.

18:52.416 --> 18:53.915
All right. We're almost there.

18:53.951 --> 18:55.450
Hold on. Heart rate's spiking.

18:55.486 --> 18:59.087
Damn. I can't continue
if she's this tachycardic.

19:00.457 --> 19:01.690
We got to slow her heart down.

19:01.725 --> 19:03.058
You gonna cardiovert?

19:03.093 --> 19:04.559
No. All this fur...
We'd never get.

19:04.595 --> 19:06.127
Enough contact with the skin.

19:06.163 --> 19:09.965
Marty, give her 6 milligrams
of adenosine.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.399
On its way.

19:18.141 --> 19:21.276
Mean arterial pressure of 70...

19:21.311 --> 19:23.378
60... 40.

19:27.284 --> 19:29.217
No pulse. Heart's arrested.

19:33.457 --> 19:35.290
She's gonna come back, right?

19:35.325 --> 19:36.424
Humans do.

19:36.460 --> 19:38.960
But this is the first time
that I've given adenosine.

19:38.996 --> 19:41.129
To a panda.

19:46.270 --> 19:47.636
Got a pulse.

19:49.506 --> 19:53.508
Map back up to 50... 60.

19:53.544 --> 19:56.311
Connor, no good. She's still
in svt and her pressure's down.

19:56.346 --> 19:57.586
All right, we've got no choice.

19:57.614 --> 20:00.282
We've got to try
to cardiovert her.

20:00.317 --> 20:02.117
Shave her.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.780
Sync. Clear.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.617
Nothing artificial. Still svt.
All right. Charge to 150.

20:13.254 --> 20:15.321
Sync.

20:18.259 --> 20:19.659
Sinus rhythm.

20:19.694 --> 20:20.905
All right, we're stable enough.

20:20.929 --> 20:22.995
Let's proceed.

20:34.876 --> 20:36.642
Shouldn't you people be working?

20:38.713 --> 20:40.546
They're treating a panda
in the cath lab.

20:40.582 --> 20:42.648
So much for non-disclosure.

20:46.688 --> 20:47.753
How's it looking?

20:47.789 --> 20:50.723
Dr. Rhodes just deployed
the asd closure device.

20:52.460 --> 20:54.560
I always learn so much
watching him.

21:06.307 --> 21:08.908
Hey there.

21:08.943 --> 21:10.510
Hey, dad.

21:10.545 --> 21:11.722
Hear there's a panda in there.

21:11.746 --> 21:13.613
Yeah. Asd repair.

21:13.648 --> 21:15.414
Of course.

21:16.784 --> 21:19.418
Wow. Looking sharp.

21:20.455 --> 21:21.921
Connor and I were
at a charity event.

21:21.956 --> 21:23.055
When he got the call.

21:23.091 --> 21:25.458
Good thing you got your mom's
looks is all I can say.

21:25.493 --> 21:26.626
Have a good time.

21:26.661 --> 21:28.728
Hey, dad?

21:31.799 --> 21:34.300
I'm gonna be here a while.

21:34.335 --> 21:36.102
How about a coffee?

21:40.508 --> 21:42.375
Yeah. Yeah, I got some time.

21:46.514 --> 21:47.725
We're still
waiting on test results,

21:47.749 --> 21:49.715
But we suspect it's
some type of od.

21:51.519 --> 21:52.919
Hey. Sorry to call you back in.

21:52.954 --> 21:54.554
No. I'm fine.

21:54.589 --> 21:55.988
Tate's not, though.

21:56.024 --> 21:58.824
Girl, my work is
a problem for him.

21:58.860 --> 22:01.327
I really thought we were
past it, but he won't let it go.

22:01.362 --> 22:03.729
Well, every couple's got stuff
they got to deal with.

22:03.765 --> 22:05.398
You're needed in 2.

22:05.433 --> 22:07.466
No way I'm gonna stop working.

22:10.972 --> 22:13.639
Mom, dad?

22:13.675 --> 22:15.741
I'm sorry. Rudy.

22:15.777 --> 22:18.144
Bun is 130. Creatinine is 6.

22:18.179 --> 22:19.645
You look at his output?

22:21.883 --> 22:23.649
Renal failure.

22:23.685 --> 22:26.752
I'm afraid rudy's going
to need emergency dialysis.

22:28.623 --> 22:31.424
Put a temporary dialysis
catheter in his left subclavian.

22:31.459 --> 22:33.125
Okay.

22:33.161 --> 22:35.928
Um, I'm sorry, folks. We're
gonna need you to wait outside.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.833
Thank you, april.

22:47.041 --> 22:48.507
Are you in?

22:48.543 --> 22:50.109
No.

22:51.512 --> 22:52.952
Must have hit the lung.
Pneumothorax.

22:52.981 --> 22:54.046
Let's get a chest x-ray.

22:54.082 --> 22:55.881
No.

22:57.585 --> 22:58.918
All right.

23:00.588 --> 23:02.788
Let's see if this lung is down.

23:09.931 --> 23:11.397
Yep, it is.

23:11.432 --> 23:13.065
No, I'll... I'll do the line.

23:13.101 --> 23:14.533
I... i don't know what happened.

23:14.569 --> 23:16.535
Prep a chest tube.

23:16.571 --> 23:18.137
Really, I thought I had it.

23:18.172 --> 23:20.873
Hey, it happens.
The lung will be fine.

23:20.908 --> 23:22.975
You'll get it.

23:26.581 --> 23:28.047
How's my son?

23:28.082 --> 23:31.150
Um, dr. Halstead will give you
an update.

23:35.923 --> 23:38.658
So...
So, how's this new apartment?

23:38.693 --> 23:41.761
It's fine,
except for my upstairs neighbor.

23:41.796 --> 23:45.031
He practices clarinet
two hours every night.

23:45.066 --> 23:47.600
And it's always

23:47.635 --> 23:49.669
"summertime" and "moon dance."

23:49.704 --> 23:53.105
Ha! Well, of course, you know
your mother and I's first date.

23:53.141 --> 23:54.674
Was a van morrison concert.

23:54.709 --> 23:56.676
Hard for me to imagine
you two dating.

23:56.711 --> 23:58.711
We had some very happy times,

23:58.746 --> 24:01.547
Especially when you
first came along.

24:01.582 --> 24:04.250
You don't remember?
Mackinac island?

24:04.285 --> 24:06.218
All that saltwater taffy?

24:06.254 --> 24:08.554
No. In frickin' paradise, man.

24:08.589 --> 24:11.757
Walking on the beach.

24:11.793 --> 24:13.459
When you were four, you...

24:13.494 --> 24:15.961
You found this pebble that you
were absolutely convinced.

24:15.997 --> 24:16.962
Looked like a bunny.

24:16.998 --> 24:18.097
A bunny? Yeah.

24:18.132 --> 24:19.699
You and your bunnies, man.

24:19.734 --> 24:21.567
Loved your bunnies.

24:21.602 --> 24:24.103
Robyn, I'm so very sorry
I was an awful father.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.807
I know, dad. I know that.

24:27.842 --> 24:30.776
But to tell you the truth,
I never really felt that way.

24:33.981 --> 24:37.817
Okay, all right. I will admit
that I was angry, yes.

24:37.852 --> 24:41.053
But it's just
because I wanted more of you.

24:44.525 --> 24:47.059
I remember I used to read
my "nancy drew" mysteries.

24:47.095 --> 24:49.228
And imagine that I was
your detective.

24:49.263 --> 24:53.866
You know, following you around,
helping you solve cases.

24:55.136 --> 24:59.004
Like... like how did my patient
develop a fixation.

24:59.040 --> 25:00.673
With doorknobs and stuff?

25:00.708 --> 25:03.242
Yeah, yeah. Something like that.

25:04.212 --> 25:05.511
Actually,
I'm surprised that you,

25:05.546 --> 25:07.847
My brilliant
psychiatrist father,

25:07.882 --> 25:10.516
Never figured it out.

25:10.551 --> 25:14.220
Epidemiology is detective work.

25:16.124 --> 25:19.325
So, you see, dad,

25:19.360 --> 25:22.595
It's all about you.

25:22.630 --> 25:25.831
I'm all about you.

25:43.851 --> 25:45.028
You carry that around with you?

25:45.052 --> 25:46.685
Always.

26:15.349 --> 26:17.983
We need you
to pronounce a patient.

26:21.355 --> 26:23.222
Where's the doctor
who ran the code?

26:23.257 --> 26:25.691
No code. Patient had a dnr.

26:28.729 --> 26:31.831
This is dr. Latham's patient.
Why didn't you call him?

26:31.866 --> 26:33.833
The family's in there.
He'd have to tell them.

26:34.802 --> 26:36.235
So?

26:36.270 --> 26:39.238
You know dr. Latham.

26:39.273 --> 26:41.607
He's a robot. Creeps people out.

26:41.642 --> 26:43.676
He'll just make them feel worse.

26:47.882 --> 26:50.716
Great.

26:50.751 --> 26:52.818
Second time tonight.

27:05.299 --> 27:07.199
Dr. Latham.

27:07.235 --> 27:09.268
Why is that resident
in with my patient?

27:09.303 --> 27:11.036
I'm afraid the patient has died.

27:11.072 --> 27:13.639
Dr. Reese is
informing the family.

27:13.674 --> 27:15.374
Why wasn't I called?

27:16.444 --> 27:18.444
We didn't see the need
to bother you.

27:18.479 --> 27:21.046
It's no bother.
I'm... it's my responsibility.

27:22.149 --> 27:23.782
Guess we should've, dr. Latham.

27:25.786 --> 27:27.353
I don't think that's very funny.

27:28.422 --> 27:30.756
A word, doctor?

27:35.296 --> 27:37.730
Can you explain
what that was about?

27:44.939 --> 27:46.305
They didn't call you.

27:46.340 --> 27:48.274
Because they don't think
you're very good.

27:48.309 --> 27:50.409
With emotionally distraught
people.

27:54.048 --> 27:55.781
Thank you for your candor.

28:05.326 --> 28:08.360
Well, the boy stopped seizing,
but he's got cerebral edema.

28:08.396 --> 28:10.462
Rick. That's his name.

28:11.732 --> 28:14.366
Hopefully mannitol will
bring it down.

28:14.402 --> 28:16.435
When rick wakes... if he wakes...

28:16.470 --> 28:18.337
We'll do cognitive tests,

28:18.372 --> 28:21.173
He's gonna have deficits.

28:21.208 --> 28:22.374
Deficits?

28:22.410 --> 28:25.044
Yeah. Like walking, talking,
bladder and bowel control.

28:25.079 --> 28:27.346
And the girl? Janna?

28:27.381 --> 28:30.382
Eeg shows she continues
to have subclinical seizures.

28:30.418 --> 28:32.117
We had to put her
in a barbiturate coma.

28:32.153 --> 28:33.163
Possible she doesn't wake up.

28:33.187 --> 28:37.990
Never wakes up, renal failure,
deficits, coma...

28:38.025 --> 28:39.224
Wheeler?

28:39.260 --> 28:40.993
They're just kids.

28:41.028 --> 28:42.528
What's the matter with you?

28:45.533 --> 28:47.900
Wheeler, are you drunk?

28:47.935 --> 28:49.134
Their lives are over.

28:49.170 --> 28:51.870
Hey! Are you drunk?

28:51.906 --> 28:53.339
Ed docs.

28:55.076 --> 28:56.475
You're through tonight.

28:57.445 --> 28:58.522
Let's get him in the lounge.

28:58.546 --> 29:00.846
God, wait!

29:00.881 --> 29:02.348
Beautiful.

29:03.451 --> 29:04.883
Thank you.

29:07.455 --> 29:08.988
Let's go.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.752
Excuse me.

29:14.787 --> 29:19.090
It's a completely different thing.
So, normal bp for a panda is 150/85.

29:19.125 --> 29:20.491
She's down to 110/60,

29:20.527 --> 29:23.294
And her heart rate's
twice what it should be.

29:23.329 --> 29:24.629
Grab me the echo, will you?
Yeah.

29:28.368 --> 29:29.800
Here you go. Thanks.

29:32.805 --> 29:34.305
She has an effusion
around the heart.

29:34.340 --> 29:37.441
Yeah. Low-pressure bleed.

29:37.477 --> 29:39.455
Damn. I must have nicked
the right atrial appendage.

29:39.479 --> 29:41.178
During the occlusion.

29:41.214 --> 29:43.814
All right, we've got
to relieve the pressure.

29:43.850 --> 29:45.182
And we shouldn't open her up.

29:45.218 --> 29:46.617
No. Can't risk the blood loss.

29:46.653 --> 29:48.152
Yeah.

29:49.489 --> 29:51.789
Okay. I'll needle her,
put in a drain,

29:51.824 --> 29:53.791
And hopefully the bleed will
stop on its own.

29:53.826 --> 29:56.661
Give me the perivac kit.
Yes, doctor.

29:58.398 --> 30:00.464
Thanks.

30:23.790 --> 30:25.723
All right.
Keep your fingers crossed.

30:39.706 --> 30:41.405
Dr. Charles.

30:41.441 --> 30:43.452
I looked online at the therapies
that you mentioned.

30:43.476 --> 30:45.343
I decided to try tms.

30:45.378 --> 30:47.612
In some cases, patients
experience profound changes.

30:47.647 --> 30:50.581
Immediately,
after one treatment.

30:50.617 --> 30:52.428
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Some cases. Most of those,

30:52.452 --> 30:54.685
A single treatment caused
only temporary change.

30:54.721 --> 30:56.554
Fifteen minutes, half an hour.

30:56.589 --> 30:58.467
Even with multiple treatments,
there's no guarantee.

30:58.491 --> 30:59.590
Of prolonged change.

30:59.626 --> 31:01.292
Tms is not a magic bullet.

31:01.327 --> 31:02.860
Still, it's encouraging.

31:02.895 --> 31:05.363
It's very encouraging.
But there's also the possibility.

31:05.398 --> 31:07.398
That in success,
your experience of tms.

31:07.433 --> 31:09.200
Could be somewhat overwhelming.

31:09.235 --> 31:10.701
Are you ready for that?

31:10.737 --> 31:13.004
I am tired of living
in a world I don't understand.

31:15.008 --> 31:16.741
Very well.

31:16.776 --> 31:19.710
I will refer you
to my colleague in the morning.

31:19.746 --> 31:20.645
I want you there.

31:20.680 --> 31:22.480
You know that I can't
prescribe treatments.

31:22.515 --> 31:24.615
For doctors that work
in the same hospital.

31:24.651 --> 31:27.551
You referred me. I don't see
why you can't observe.

31:28.621 --> 31:29.732
Well, when you put it that way,

31:29.756 --> 31:30.899
I don't see why I couldn't,
either.

31:30.923 --> 31:32.556
Good. Let's start tonight.

31:32.592 --> 31:33.924
Tonight? If you don't mind.

31:33.960 --> 31:35.559
It's three o'clock
in the morning.

31:35.595 --> 31:37.561
I'm not gonna call dr. Weyland
at 3:00 a.M.

31:37.597 --> 31:39.563
I'll pick up the cost.
That's not the point.

31:39.599 --> 31:41.577
Dr. Latham, are you sure
that you don't want to go home.

31:41.601 --> 31:42.601
And sleep on this?

31:42.635 --> 31:43.746
Just think about it
a little bit?

31:43.770 --> 31:46.270
Dr. Charles, please.

32:04.357 --> 32:06.257
Hey. Hey.

32:06.292 --> 32:07.758
How's she doing?

32:07.794 --> 32:09.460
About the same.

32:09.495 --> 32:12.363
No worse.

32:12.398 --> 32:15.466
So, you volunteer at the zoo?

32:15.501 --> 32:16.801
Yeah.

32:18.638 --> 32:21.472
How come?

32:21.507 --> 32:23.541
You'll laugh.

32:23.576 --> 32:25.776
Just try me.

32:25.812 --> 32:28.079
All right.

32:31.751 --> 32:33.984
A few hours ago,
I lost a kid who was shot.

32:35.655 --> 32:37.488
Another one.

32:37.523 --> 32:40.324
So much of my work...
Stabbings, shootings...

32:41.694 --> 32:44.028
It's dark, man.

32:44.063 --> 32:46.330
Worst of human nature.

32:48.334 --> 32:51.335
But animals...

32:51.370 --> 32:52.815
Not to say they don't kill
each other,

32:52.839 --> 32:54.672
But they don't do it
out of malice.

32:58.010 --> 33:00.044
They're innocent.

33:02.615 --> 33:05.015
They're light.

33:14.694 --> 33:16.127
How do you feel?

33:17.730 --> 33:19.029
Awful.

33:19.065 --> 33:21.565
All right.

33:21.601 --> 33:24.001
I'm not letting you drive home.

33:24.036 --> 33:25.936
Why don't you go lay down
in the on-call room?

33:25.972 --> 33:29.840
God.
Right in front of the troll.

33:31.477 --> 33:32.710
Am I finished?

33:32.745 --> 33:34.345
No.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.413
It's not up to him.

33:37.650 --> 33:39.517
You are gonna have to go
to therapy,

33:39.552 --> 33:41.619
Sign a contract saying
it won't happen again,

33:41.654 --> 33:45.022
And if it does,
you will be fired.

33:45.057 --> 33:47.458
My parents...

33:47.493 --> 33:49.059
How am I gonna tell them?

33:51.764 --> 33:54.064
Hey, wheeler, it's not the end.

33:54.100 --> 33:55.599
Okay? You can get past this.

34:18.925 --> 34:21.592
How is he? Physically okay.

34:21.627 --> 34:23.893
Just hungover.

34:23.929 --> 34:25.795
So, what did abrams mean.

34:25.831 --> 34:27.665
By "ed docs"?

34:27.699 --> 34:31.635
Among the staff,
highest rate of alcoholism,

34:31.670 --> 34:33.804
Ed docs.

34:33.840 --> 34:36.440
Battle fatigue.

34:41.013 --> 34:43.681
The session lasts 24 minutes.

34:43.716 --> 34:45.683
Every 20 seconds,
you'll receive a pulse,

34:45.717 --> 34:48.085
Which lasts about two seconds.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.186
Ready?

34:49.222 --> 34:51.455
Yeah.

34:57.163 --> 34:58.796
You okay? Is it tolerable?

34:58.831 --> 34:59.997
Yes.

35:25.758 --> 35:29.126
Mrs. Novak.

35:29.161 --> 35:30.527
Hold compressions.

35:30.563 --> 35:32.730
Still vf on the monitor.

35:32.765 --> 35:34.899
Charge 200.

35:34.934 --> 35:36.967
Clear.

35:44.677 --> 35:45.843
She's gone.

35:45.878 --> 35:47.077
She's dead?

35:47.113 --> 35:48.479
Your patient, right?

35:48.514 --> 35:50.114
Yes. Do you want to call it?

35:51.217 --> 35:52.816
Did you follow my instructions?

35:52.852 --> 35:54.818
Of course. Then what happened?

35:54.854 --> 35:55.920
Respiratory failure.

35:55.955 --> 35:58.022
She had pneumonia, you know.

35:59.959 --> 36:02.026
Are you gonna call it?

36:06.766 --> 36:08.832
4:02.

36:13.572 --> 36:15.306
This wasn't supposed to happen.

36:17.209 --> 36:18.876
It's nobody's fault.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.547
Wasn't supposed to happen.

36:30.313 --> 36:32.247
So, how you feeling? Any change?

36:32.282 --> 36:34.082
Not that I can tell.Ory.

36:34.117 --> 36:36.318
Yeah? No headache?

36:36.353 --> 36:37.452
No.

36:43.594 --> 36:45.994
<i>I hope you don't mind
that I'm dating your boyfriend.</i>

36:47.798 --> 36:50.098
<i>No, of course not.</i>

36:50.133 --> 36:51.933
<i>Why would I mind?</i>

36:51.969 --> 36:53.368
<i>Can we still be friends?</i>

36:53.403 --> 36:56.304
<i>Sure.
I'll be your maid of honor.</i>

36:57.307 --> 37:00.575
So, um, anything striking you
differently?

37:02.613 --> 37:05.280
That woman does mind.

37:05.315 --> 37:07.082
She says she doesn't,
but she clearly does.

37:07.117 --> 37:08.283
Yeah.

37:08.318 --> 37:10.285
She's being sarcastic.

37:10.320 --> 37:12.854
You... you didn't
pick that up before.

37:14.091 --> 37:15.123
No.

37:15.158 --> 37:17.125
Looks like you could be
an excellent candidate.

37:17.160 --> 37:18.927
For this therapy.

37:18.962 --> 37:20.528
It's like I've been blind.

37:32.342 --> 37:34.609
Blood has stopped draining.

37:34.645 --> 37:36.978
Bp and heart rate
have normalized.

37:37.014 --> 37:40.248
We've dialed back on the
sedation, see how she responds.

37:40.284 --> 37:43.518
No, no, no. We're not
shooting a panda in my hospital.

37:46.256 --> 37:47.889
She's coming around.

37:51.929 --> 37:53.328
All right!

37:53.363 --> 37:55.163
Looks good.

37:55.198 --> 37:58.500
Well, we don't need a bear
roaming the hospital.

37:58.535 --> 38:00.468
Marty, put her back under.

38:00.504 --> 38:02.938
Right.

38:02.973 --> 38:04.973
Congratulations, everyone.

38:24.294 --> 38:27.262
Dr. Reese, how's our patient?

38:27.297 --> 38:28.964
She died.

38:31.468 --> 38:33.868
They all died.

38:33.904 --> 38:35.181
All of them. Three in one night.

38:35.205 --> 38:38.540
That's terrible. I'm so sorry.

38:38.575 --> 38:41.643
It's too much, you know?
It's all too much.

38:41.678 --> 38:43.979
We need to get you
a little sleep.

38:44.014 --> 38:45.447
No.

38:45.482 --> 38:47.515
No. I...

38:51.054 --> 38:52.454
I'll do it.

38:52.489 --> 38:54.356
Dr. Charles, I want to do it.

38:54.391 --> 38:55.890
I need it.

38:55.926 --> 38:57.125
Do what?

38:57.160 --> 39:00.061
Therapy.

39:00.097 --> 39:02.630
I can't handle anything.

39:02.666 --> 39:04.065
I'm no good at anything.

39:04.101 --> 39:08.236
I'm... i'm a fraud.
I'm just gonna disappoint you.

39:08.271 --> 39:10.538
Come here.

39:10.574 --> 39:12.240
It's okay.

39:12.275 --> 39:15.076
That's not gonna happen.
That's not true at all.

39:20.384 --> 39:22.017
It's okay.

39:27.524 --> 39:30.025
Excuse me. Have a good day.

39:30.060 --> 39:33.228
So, we're gonna have to round
on wheeler's patients.

39:33.263 --> 39:34.440
I'll take half,
you take the other?

39:34.464 --> 39:35.663
Okay.

39:37.067 --> 39:38.466
And good job last night.

39:39.970 --> 39:42.270
Thanks. Yeah.

39:42.305 --> 39:45.440
You hung in there. You should
consider emergency medicine.

39:45.475 --> 39:47.008
I will.

39:48.412 --> 39:49.544
Morning.

39:50.781 --> 39:52.380
Morning.

39:52.416 --> 39:53.715
How'd it go?

39:55.385 --> 39:56.751
The usual.

39:56.787 --> 39:58.720
Good.

40:01.391 --> 40:02.635
I guess I'm gonna
start those rounds.

40:02.659 --> 40:04.692
Yeah.

40:11.735 --> 40:13.701
April.

40:16.440 --> 40:17.739
It's not that easy.

40:17.774 --> 40:20.108
I know how much
your work means to you.

40:20.143 --> 40:20.975
I'm sorry.

40:21.011 --> 40:23.645
Tate, we keep having
the same argument.

40:23.680 --> 40:25.380
We won't. Not anymore.

40:25.415 --> 40:26.481
I mean it.

40:26.516 --> 40:29.484
Look. I am the way I am.
If I don't make you happy...

40:29.519 --> 40:33.121
You do, april.
I don't want to change you.

40:33.156 --> 40:35.356
Okay?

40:42.699 --> 40:44.566
Let's go home.

40:44.601 --> 40:46.534
You can scramble me some eggs.

40:49.806 --> 40:53.341
<i>And now I'd like to introduce
you to dr. Connor rhodes,</i>

40:53.376 --> 40:56.778
<i>Who performed the procedure.

40:56.813 --> 40:59.747

Good morning to everybody.</i>

40:59.783 --> 41:03.451
<i>Su lin was suffering from an
atrial septal defect, which...</i>
