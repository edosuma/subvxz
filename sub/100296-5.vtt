about you, son.

00:04.260 --> 00:06.308
And I do not accept
your resignation

00:06.350 --> 00:08.124
because your dad
wouldn't want that.

When this is all over,
you and me,

00:28.110 --> 00:29.281
we're gonna step outside

The other day, I saw
a group of 'em hot boxing,

00:47.000 --> 00:49.036
All right, don't worry,
we'll get this
all squared away.

00:54.790 --> 00:56.132
Hey, I'm not gonna
ask you again.

00:56.180 --> 00:57.738

How I can teach Roberto

learn how to surf,

if they can swim.

as their dad?

a terrible father?

do I know about it?

Look, you said
a few weeks ago,
you know,

08:44.740 --> 08:46.514
"We may want them,
but do they really want us?"

08:46.560 --> 08:47.902
And then I thought,
"You know what?"

08:48.610 --> 08:49.736
You're absolutely right.

08:51.220 --> 08:52.869
I'm rushing this.

or we're gonna lose 'em.

holding out on me, huh?

I was thinking we could
just throw those away.

09:45.490 --> 09:46.661
You serious?

09:48.100 --> 09:49.408
The things in those boxes
belong to someone else.

were done dealing.

to break you.

All right?

10:47.470 --> 10:50.291
Promise me if things go down,

10:50.820 --> 10:51.946
you'll look after my Moms.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.604
She doesn't deserve
to go through this.

10:57.300 --> 10:58.699
You know I got you.

10:59.570 --> 11:01.219

I didn't do this, right?

11:03.440 --> 11:04.873
But that's not
gonna be enough.

11:09.750 --> 11:11.479
I'm sick and tired of this!

11:11.540 --> 11:13.019
When is it gonna stop?

11:13.060 --> 11:15.528
Today I had a gun pointed
at the back of my head

11:15.580 --> 11:17.662
by an LAPD officer.

11:18.540 --> 11:19.711
And you and I both know

11:19.760 --> 11:21.193
that almost had
a different ending!

And I would've been

-Damn it!

11:26.250 --> 11:27.285
Look at me.

11:29.510 --> 11:30.465
I hear you.

11:30.510 --> 11:31.818
I did not get this badge

11:31.860 --> 11:33.339
to look the other way.

11:33.380 --> 11:34.426
Then don't.

11:35.780 --> 11:37.645
Whenever you put on
this uniform,

11:37.690 --> 11:40.602
you owe it to every
wrongfully accused black man

11:40.650 --> 11:42.606
to uphold the oath we took.

11:43.220 --> 11:45.529
So instead of trading blows
with this locker,

11:46.220 --> 11:47.699
let's find out
what's really gomg on.

11:49.090 --> 11:49.966
Where do we start?

11:50.010 --> 11:51.432
By finding the person

11:51.490 --> 11:53.446
who had a reason
to kill Trent Anderson.

11:58.970 --> 12:00.494
You identified yourself, yeah?

12:00.540 --> 12:01.438
JOSEPH: Yes.

12:02.540 --> 12:03.757
You move again,
you will get shot.

12:05.150 --> 12:06.629
What's the name of this officer?

12:07.110 --> 12:08.327
It doesn't matter right now.

12:08.770 --> 12:11.068
It does to me.
I want his name.

12:11.550 --> 12:14.018
The only name that matters
right now is Matthew Evans.

12:15.030 --> 12:16.759
There's gotta be something
that we can do, Bill.

12:16.820 --> 12:17.946
He's innocent.

12:18.520 --> 12:19.646
I'm sheriff.

12:21.130 --> 12:23.644
Asking me to look into
an LAPD case on your old buddy

12:24.260 --> 12:25.568
is no small ask.

12:25.610 --> 12:27.510
I need something more to go on.

12:28.480 --> 12:29.913
This is his arrest record.

12:30.440 --> 12:31.691
[Bill sighs]

12:33.010 --> 12:34.045
BILL: Robbery.

12:34.840 --> 12:36.228
Drug possession.

12:36.270 --> 12:37.658
I thought you said
you wanted to help him.

12:37.710 --> 12:39.223
Look at the dates.

12:39.280 --> 12:40.963
That's who he was.
Not who he is.

12:42.280 --> 12:44.054
He put that life
behind him years ago.

12:44.110 --> 12:45.532
He isn't a killer,

12:45.590 --> 12:48.229
and he definitely
did not kill this Trent guy.

12:48.590 --> 12:50.899
Everything inside of me
is telling me

12:51.720 --> 12:52.937
that Matthew is innocent.

12:53.770 --> 12:55.897
All I'm asking you
to do is look into it.

12:57.600 --> 12:59.852
I can't do that
on gut Instinct alone.

13:00.170 --> 13:01.205
Really?

13:02.730 --> 13:05.688
Because that is the one thing
you taught me to trust.

13:12.570 --> 13:13.605
BILL:
What'd you find out?

13:13.660 --> 13:15.082
I learned that
Trent Anderson

13:15.140 --> 13:17.096
was a big-time drug dealer
on the south side.

13:17.140 --> 13:18.437
Ran multiple blocks

13:18.490 --> 13:19.707
and was recruiting
neighborhood kids

13:19.750 --> 13:21.399
as runners for his business.

13:21.450 --> 13:24.317
Well, now that he's gone,
I'm sure there's a power void.

13:24.360 --> 13:25.577
Top of the pyramid falls,

13:25.630 --> 13:26.972
plenty of people
are eager to fill in.

13:27.020 --> 13:29.796
So who at the LAPD
is handling this case?

13:30.670 --> 13:32.274
I'm afraid to ask
where this is going.

13:32.330 --> 13:33.490
Then don't.

13:35.110 --> 13:36.372
Sir, I need you to understand
the political repercussions

13:36.420 --> 13:37.637
prior to inserting yourself

13:37.680 --> 13:39.500
into another _
agency's Investigation.

13:39.550 --> 13:41.598
Bishop, Joseph's my godson.

13:41.860 --> 13:42.940
He's a good kid.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.503
He's never asked me
for anything.

13:44.560 --> 13:46.642
The least I can do
IS give It a look.

13:47.340 --> 13:50.423
I hear you, but you're walking
a political tightrope here.

13:50.480 --> 13:52.289
Not to mention,
this could be misinterpreted

13:52.350 --> 13:53.692
as a form of nepotism.

13:53.740 --> 13:56.527
Oh. That's exactly
what this is.

14:14.540 --> 14:16.588
[indistinct chatter]

14:19.240 --> 14:20.764
Oh. Hi, Sheriff.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.508
-Do you have an appointment?
-Yes.

14:22.550 --> 14:23.892
[door buzzes]

14:28.950 --> 14:31.293
-Sir, I don't see you on here.
-Oh, it's there. Hollister.

14:31.340 --> 14:32.989
What floor is homicide on?

14:33.610 --> 14:35.168
-Four.
-Thank you, Officer.

14:46.140 --> 14:47.698
Detective Johnson.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.537
Yes, Sheriff.

14:51.580 --> 14:53.923
-Can I help you?
-Don't know yet.

14:53.980 --> 14:56.619
I'm here to talk about something
that happened earlier today

14:56.670 --> 14:59.230
with the LAPD
and one of my deputies.

14:59.280 --> 15:00.804
I heard about that.

15:01.030 --> 15:02.452
Luckily, everyone's okay.

15:03.160 --> 15:04.582
I wouldn't say okay.

15:04.990 --> 15:06.639
That deputy is
a good friend of mine,

15:06.680 --> 15:08.409
my godson, actually.

15:08.470 --> 15:10.119
Would you like
to talk to the officer?

15:10.170 --> 15:12.115
-I can call him.
-I'm not worried
about that right now.

15:12.170 --> 15:14.297
More curious about
the guy you arrested.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.389
My information tells me
you might have the wrong man.

15:18.870 --> 15:20.349
I can't really comment on that.

15:21.260 --> 15:23.308
Why does
the Sheriff's Department
care about this case?

15:23.700 --> 15:25.565
I'm doing a favor for my godson.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.745
He grew up with the accused.

15:27.790 --> 15:31.009
And, well, you and I both know
how these things go.

15:31.580 --> 15:33.832
I wanna give him
some perspective.

15:36.020 --> 15:37.009
Hmm.

15:38.240 --> 15:39.400
All right.

15:40.760 --> 15:44.150
"Dead gangster,
Trent Anderson,
found in a car.

15:44.200 --> 15:45.713
"During the execution
of my search warrant

15:45.770 --> 15:47.067
"I found the same caliber weapon

15:47.120 --> 15:49.896
used in the murder
in Matthew Evans' house."

15:51.770 --> 15:53.590
Wish I had better news
for your godson.

15:53.640 --> 15:54.948
Deputy Harris.

15:57.170 --> 15:58.467
No, I get it.

15:58.520 --> 15:59.942
Nothing else, huh?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.769
You know these boys
and their beefs.

16:04.310 --> 16:07.177
Even have video footage
connecting Matthew and Trent.

16:08.180 --> 16:10.432
-They knew each other?
-Looks that way.

16:10.750 --> 16:12.911
Pretty much
open-and-shut case.

16:13.580 --> 16:14.740
So...

16:15.270 --> 16:16.669
Thank you.

16:23.500 --> 16:24.979
-Am I early?
-No.

16:25.020 --> 16:25.975
We're late.

16:27.200 --> 16:28.019
This meeting should have
happened months ago.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.230
Please, sit.

16:33.250 --> 16:36.117
I'm sorry, what am I
missing here, Derek?

16:36.470 --> 16:38.028
You know the situation.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.900
We need changes to stay afloat.

16:39.950 --> 16:42.202
I could waste time
with consultants

16:42.260 --> 16:44.080
but everyone says
you're critical

16:44.130 --> 16:45.552
to the success
of the hospital.

16:45.610 --> 16:46.998
I need your expertise.

16:47.570 --> 16:48.912
If I'm hearing you correctly,

16:48.960 --> 16:50.780
you're asking me
to help you gut St. Regents.

16:51.220 --> 16:52.209
More like trim the fat.

16:53.490 --> 16:56.914
Our staff is already
overworked, underpaid.

16:56.970 --> 16:59.791
Any trims means dead bodies
on our doorstep.

16:59.840 --> 17:01.569
Neither of us wants that.

17:01.620 --> 17:03.759
But if we don't make
the right changes now,

17:03.800 --> 17:05.756
the board will panic
and make the wrong ones.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.404
You asked for my expertise.

17:07.460 --> 17:10.190
And I'm telling you
the department can't run safely

17:10.240 --> 17:11.798
if we make these cuts.

17:11.850 --> 17:14.808
If we don't make the cuts,
there will be no department.

17:15.940 --> 17:17.282
Then start by cutting me.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.337
TERESA:
Neither looks good.

17:24.390 --> 17:25.516
And if you take the plea,

17:25.560 --> 17:27.380
you're looking
at a minimum of 25.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.427
Well, what's the other option?

17:30.130 --> 17:31.518
Roll the dice,

17:31.570 --> 17:34.130
take your chance at trial,
possibly face life.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.348
Sorry to interrupt.

17:42.270 --> 17:43.965
Needed to put a face
to the name.

17:44.670 --> 17:46.661
Joseph tells me
you two go way back.

17:48.630 --> 17:50.188
Joseph's been my boy
since day one.

17:51.760 --> 17:53.273
That why you lie to him?

17:55.550 --> 17:56.630
I didn't lie.

17:57.290 --> 17:58.370
Hmm.

17:59.250 --> 18:00.979
'Cause they got footage
and text messages

18:01.030 --> 18:02.156
of you and Trent.

18:02.210 --> 18:04.075
Something about
you wantin' back in.

18:04.120 --> 18:05.462
And he was playin' hard ball.

18:05.860 --> 18:08.078
Meanwhile, Joseph's out there
running around

18:08.600 --> 18:10.943
trying to figure out a way
to get your ass outta here.

18:13.610 --> 18:15.339
Least you could do
is come clean.

18:20.960 --> 18:23.224
You ever try find a job
with a felony on your record?

18:23.880 --> 18:25.051
I had no other choice.

18:25.840 --> 18:27.137
Needed the money.

18:27.190 --> 18:29.055
These bills aren't gonna
pay themselves.

18:29.100 --> 18:30.795
And Joseph's out there
because he knows I'm innocent.

18:30.840 --> 18:31.750
I didn't kill anybody.

18:32.850 --> 18:33.839
Look, we need to focus
on the deal.

18:34.460 --> 18:36.143
Weigh the risks on both sides.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.417
Wait a minute. What deal?

18:38.240 --> 18:39.969
The prosecutor offered
a plea bargain.

18:40.770 --> 18:42.283
Joh_nson never
mentioned a deal.

18:43.860 --> 18:46.727
Why would they try
and cut a deal when
they have a solid case?

18:48.820 --> 18:49.980
That's a good question.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.648
Bail is set at
half a million dollars.

18:55.220 --> 18:57.120
Your honor, that is punitive.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.603
Given the cold-blooded murder

18:58.650 --> 19:00.254
and the criminal history
of the accused,

19:00.310 --> 19:02.699
the people believe he shouldn't
even be granted that.

19:03.270 --> 19:05.522
And since defense
has rejected our deal,

19:05.570 --> 19:07.834
we'd like to proceed
with our arraignment.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.132
Your Honor, ifI may approach.

19:10.190 --> 19:11.487
You may not.

19:14.580 --> 19:16.104
Well, the bailiff won't stop me.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.669
He works for me.

19:23.160 --> 19:24.673
This is about turf.

19:24.720 --> 19:26.893
Your Honor,
cooperation between LAPD

19:26.940 --> 19:28.202
and the Sheriff's Department

19:28.250 --> 19:29.547
has a long
and successful history.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.374
That's not the turf
I'm talkin' about.

19:31.430 --> 19:33.375
I'm talkin' about
political turf.

19:33.650 --> 19:36.039
The DA wants to
up their conVIctlon rate,

19:36.080 --> 19:39.083
so they look
for quick solutions.

19:39.130 --> 19:40.643
They set the bail
high enough

19:40.700 --> 19:43.339
to where the accused has
no choice but to sit in jail

19:43.390 --> 19:44.948
and accept a bad deal.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.560
They're trying to overwhelm
the justice process

19:47.620 --> 19:50.134
before there's even time
to uncover the truth.

19:50.180 --> 19:51.738
This has to stop.

19:52.100 --> 19:55.445
We are to serve all people
and give them their fair shake.

19:55.800 --> 19:58.837
Yes, put the bad guys
behind bars,

19:59.540 --> 20:01.326
but only for the wrongs
they've done,

20:01.370 --> 20:03.838
not the wrongs
we refuse to investigate.

20:04.460 --> 20:05.893
And he,
like every other citizen,

20:05.940 --> 20:07.498
deserves a fair trial

20:07.550 --> 20:10.599
predicated on
a genuine investigation.

20:10.640 --> 20:12.892
Your delay tactics
aren't helping anyone.

20:13.340 --> 20:15.296
_ This defense
IS never gonna rest.

20:16.300 --> 20:17.722
I'd like to postpone
arraignment

20:17.780 --> 20:20.601
until my department has time
to look into the case.

20:22.650 --> 20:25.255
After all, this is my county.

20:25.310 --> 20:27.084
I'm requesting 48 hours.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.574
You've got 24 hours.

20:39.490 --> 20:40.570
Close enough.

20:41.020 --> 20:42.055
[bangs gavel]

20:49.550 --> 20:50.676
If I'm gonna help you,

20:50.720 --> 20:52.768
I wanna know all the players.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.417
Top to bottom.

20:58.210 --> 20:59.507
All of 'em.

21:11.180 --> 21:12.477
[door bell chimes]

21:14.920 --> 21:15.875
Thank you.

21:21.140 --> 21:22.277
Alec Wells?

21:22.890 --> 21:23.925
Who's asking?

21:24.450 --> 21:25.496
I'm not asking.

21:27.460 --> 21:28.757
Man, if this is about Trent,

21:28.800 --> 21:30.449
my story hasn't changed.

21:30.500 --> 21:32.411
No, this is the first time
I'm hearing it, brother.

21:33.160 --> 21:34.195
Enlighten me.

21:35.380 --> 21:36.369
[sighs]

21:37.680 --> 21:38.931
I stopped workin' for him
a few months ago.

21:40.030 --> 21:41.110
He got greedy.

21:42.600 --> 21:43.851
Started doin' business
with anyone that was willing.

21:44.990 --> 21:46.332
He sounds like
a real go-getter.

21:46.390 --> 21:47.425
Well, he was
all about the money.

21:47.480 --> 21:48.993
Was only a matter of time

21:49.040 --> 21:50.689
before he made a deal
with the wrong people.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.434
So you think Trent was
smoked over a deal gone bad.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.345
Look, all I'm saying is
his entire circle

21:56.400 --> 21:58.356
started gettin' picked off
one by one.

21:59.230 --> 22:00.356
They were murdered?

22:00.400 --> 22:01.355
[scoffs]

22:01.880 --> 22:02.926
Nah.

22:04.140 --> 22:05.357
Locked up.

22:08.540 --> 22:10.269
I think I just
got myself fired.

22:10.320 --> 22:11.924
They want me
to make the cuts.

22:11.980 --> 22:13.584
"Trim the fat"
is what he told me.

22:13.630 --> 22:16.360
That sounds like something
that Derek would say.

22:16.420 --> 22:18.285
Yeah, but I told Derek
that he can make
the cuts himself

22:18.330 --> 22:19.456
and he can start with me.

22:19.510 --> 22:21.284
Wait, was I in that meeting?

22:21.860 --> 22:22.804
[sighs]

22:23.950 --> 22:25.076
Well, you've clearly
rubbed off on me.

22:25.120 --> 22:26.985
A great woman doctor
told me something

22:27.040 --> 22:28.723
that stuck with me
over the years.

22:28.780 --> 22:30.338
"It's not all about you."

22:30.390 --> 22:32.346
No, I don't need advice.
I just need support.

22:32.690 --> 22:34.908
Honey, you're
missin' something.

22:34.960 --> 22:37.349
If you leave,
is the hospital better off?

22:37.700 --> 22:39.042
Probably not.

22:39.530 --> 22:40.656
Damn right it isn't.

22:42.140 --> 22:43.482
Yeah, that's pretty
sage advice,
Sheriff Hollister.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.657
BILL: We all got bosses
we gotta deal with.

22:45.710 --> 22:47.189
PAULA: You don't.

22:47.230 --> 22:48.788
Now, you know
that's not true.

22:55.630 --> 22:57.063
JOSEPH: How do you know
about this spot?

22:57.110 --> 22:59.806
I used to pass by here
when I taught at Crozier.

23:00.420 --> 23:01.717
Kids called it "the plug."

23:01.770 --> 23:03.419
Information spot of the hood.

23:04.070 --> 23:06.721
These dudes, they know
everything about everybody.

23:07.470 --> 23:09.119
You wanna know
who had beef with Trent,

23:09.910 --> 23:11.036
this is your first stop.

23:12.650 --> 23:13.776
Go on, you got it.

23:14.080 --> 23:15.126
All right.

[door bell jingles]

23:25.660 --> 23:26.695
How you guys doin'?

23:30.930 --> 23:32.409
Deputy Harris.

23:32.580 --> 23:35.310
Had a few questions I wanted
to ask about Trent Anderson.

23:36.980 --> 23:39.448
Y'all really won't let
the homey rest, will you?

23:39.500 --> 23:41.627
Hey, I'm just tryin'
to get some answers, man.

23:42.460 --> 23:45.418
Trent burned bridges
as fast as he could build 'em.

23:45.460 --> 23:47.064
Even with the people
closest to him.

23:47.120 --> 23:49.111
Dude only cared
about the money.

23:50.210 --> 23:51.939
Now get your
sell-out ass outta here,

23:51.990 --> 23:53.810
before it gets a little
dangerous in here too.

24:01.170 --> 24:02.478
Is that a threat?

24:04.610 --> 24:06.089
It's whatever
you want It to be.

24:06.480 --> 24:08.266
An innocent man
is about to be locked away

24:08.310 --> 24:10.301
for a crime he did not commit.

24:12.140 --> 24:13.482
Oh, you're confused.

24:14.710 --> 24:17.099
Welcome to
black America, Deputy.

24:17.150 --> 24:18.959
How about you never put
your hands on me again?

24:20.370 --> 24:22.713
-How about that?
-Boot!

24:22.760 --> 24:24.193
Enough.

24:26.160 --> 24:31.063
This badge means
I protect you, you, and you.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.944
And if that makes me
any less of a black man,

24:34.990 --> 24:37.038
then you're the one
who's confused.

24:42.210 --> 24:43.381
Y'all have a good day.

24:45.780 --> 24:46.917
[door bell jingles]

24:50.050 --> 24:51.483
MINNICK:
You need to
take a breather.

24:52.360 --> 24:53.782
Especially after
what happened back there.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.705
Now, I've been lettin'
a lot ride today

24:55.750 --> 24:57.229
on account of
what you're gomg through,

24:57.270 --> 24:58.874
but you are still my boot.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.880
You've got to realize you have
two different identities.

25:02.930 --> 25:05.626
There's Joseph
and there's Deputy Harris.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.228
And when you're
wearin' a badge,

25:07.280 --> 25:10.499
they don't see the color
of your skin, they see a cop.

25:10.550 --> 25:11.938
How do you choose
between the two?

25:11.980 --> 25:13.151
MINNICK: You don't.

25:15.200 --> 25:18.328
I need you to focus on Matthew.

25:18.600 --> 25:19.897
What did you learn back there?

25:20.380 --> 25:21.904
"Trent burned a lot of bridges."

25:21.950 --> 25:23.429
Okay. And?

25:23.650 --> 25:26.426
He gave no mercy.
He even turned on his own crew.

25:26.480 --> 25:28.129
Sounds like
the making of a snitch.

25:28.170 --> 25:29.649
Could've been
what got him killed.

25:29.700 --> 25:30.860
What does Trent benefit

25:30.920 --> 25:32.729
by getting
his own people locked up?

25:32.790 --> 25:33.916
Power.

25:36.050 --> 25:38.268
Maybe he wasn't
the only one benefiting.

25:44.840 --> 25:46.091
CADE: Check it.

25:46.150 --> 25:47.845
I looked at Trent
on LA CLEAR,

25:47.890 --> 25:49.278
the DEA popped up.

25:49.330 --> 25:50.979
-DEA?
-Yeah.

25:51.020 --> 25:52.578
His name is tied
to four different dope cases,

25:52.630 --> 25:53.619
all homicides.

25:55.070 --> 25:56.674
BILL: _
So Trent was a wrtness
for the prosecution.

25:56.720 --> 25:58.722
The only way a guy
like that flips

25:59.340 --> 26:00.546
is if it benefits him.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.591
He dropped a dime
on his own crew.

26:03.250 --> 26:04.649
It's how he got all his juice.

26:04.690 --> 26:06.339
And whoever offed him

26:06.390 --> 26:08.551
probably thought Trent
was gonna rat him out next.

26:09.560 --> 26:11.778
Could've been Alec.
He wanted to promote.

26:11.830 --> 26:13.912
The only way someone
would have known any of this

26:13.960 --> 26:16.042
is if they were
law enforcement.

26:16.090 --> 26:17.694
Someone with a badge.

26:18.480 --> 26:20.220

just made bail.

on his phone.

hungry as hell.

how you bail me out?

27:53.620 --> 27:56.180
Sorry, man,
it's gotta go down like this,

27:56.230 --> 27:58.278
but business is business.

27:58.320 --> 27:59.753
You can't be serious, man.

28:00.800 --> 28:02.324
Trent said the same thing.

Now what you think's
gonna happen

come here and rob me?

killed Trent Anderson.

Right this way.

you should hear him out.

After all, it's your case.

Sure.

This right here is your shooter.

30:35.650 --> 30:36.867
What evidence do you have?

30:36.920 --> 30:38.729
You should know that already.

30:39.180 --> 30:42.138

to line your own pockets.

30:42.920 --> 30:44.649
-What are you talking about?
-Follow me.

30:55.110 --> 30:56.975
Can you point
to the man you work for?

31:03.940 --> 31:05.373
I bet if Trent
was still alive,

31:05.420 --> 31:06.899
he'd be pointing at you too.

31:07.860 --> 31:10.249
You can't do this.
You're crazy.

31:10.300 --> 31:13.167
It's not crazy to keep
an innocent man outta jail.

32:28.720 --> 32:30.119
Here's one piece of advice.

puts you on someone else's list.

I was just trusting my instinct.

it means a lot to me.

37:09.130 --> 37:10.210
'Bout to win

37:10.270 --> 37:11.521
You gonna say something

37:11.570 --> 37:13.299
or we just gonna
do this the entire drive?

37:13.840 --> 37:15.171
You lied to me, man.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.129
And I put my job
on the line for you.

37:18.620 --> 37:19.928
What was I supposed to do?

37:19.970 --> 37:21.221
Be straight up with me.

37:21.800 --> 37:23.142
Man, I was tryin'
to protect you.

37:24.280 --> 37:25.668
The less you know the better.

37:28.150 --> 37:29.845
_ Just don't_ever
lie to me again, man.

37:33.290 --> 37:35.110
You don't know
how hard it is out here, man.

37:36.340 --> 37:37.637
That's why you have me.

37:38.690 --> 37:39.725
All right?

37:41.300 --> 37:42.335
True.

37:43.910 --> 37:44.865
You know, there's somethin'
you can get better with, too.

37:46.000 --> 37:46.989
What's that?

37:47.700 --> 37:48.951
Your weak-ass jump shot.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.342
[both laugh]

37:50.870 --> 37:52.178
Okay, you got jokes.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.262
Yeah, we gonna find out, man.

37:54.310 --> 37:55.698
All that talk, okay?

37:57.490 --> 37:59.742
-Ha!
-You know you
messed up, right?

37:59.790 --> 38:01.348
Yeah, all right.
I'm always in trouble.

38:01.400 --> 38:02.924
-You done messed up.
-Stop, bro.

38:02.970 --> 38:04.756
We're gonna see about this.
Let's go.

38:04.800 --> 38:05.880
Let's go. Over here.

38:08.060 --> 38:09.709
So you feeling like Kobe
in his prime, huh?

38:10.370 --> 38:11.928
I am Kobe in his prime.

38:11.980 --> 38:14.494
Oh. Well, let's hope
that badge gives
you superpowers.

38:14.550 --> 38:16.063
I'm tellin' you,
you gonna need it.

38:16.110 --> 38:18.249
-Loser gets dinner?
-Bet.

38:19.990 --> 38:22.026
-[Joseph laughing]
-Come on!

38:23.250 --> 38:25.241
-Okay, let's go.
-Yes, Kobe!

[door buzzing]

38:36.960 --> 38:39.042
[indistinct radio chatter]

38:43.580 --> 38:44.569
BILL: Pop the door.

38:44.620 --> 38:46.178
[buzzing]

38:50.670 --> 38:51.921
I got one question.

38:55.150 --> 38:56.014
Why?

39:00.900 --> 39:02.333
I don't have an answer.

39:03.070 --> 39:04.287
Well, keep digging.

39:04.730 --> 39:05.719
I'll wait.

39:10.040 --> 39:12.349
You had a career.
You trashed it.

39:13.520 --> 39:15.829
And all your crap
got slung on to everyone else

39:15.870 --> 39:17.178
who wears a badge.

39:17.650 --> 39:19.470
So I'm asking for them,
not just for me.

39:20.180 --> 39:21.215
Why?

39:25.620 --> 39:28.180
You ever cheated
on anyone, Sheriff?

39:28.710 --> 39:30.359
Well, I've done
a whole lot in my life.

39:31.100 --> 39:32.089
Never that.

39:33.930 --> 39:35.363
You never see the line...

39:37.150 --> 39:38.583
until you're past it.

39:39.280 --> 39:40.542
Once you're over it,

39:40.940 --> 39:45.149
you can't go back
without fear of getting caught.

39:46.730 --> 39:47.947
Next thing you know,

39:49.380 --> 39:51.029
you couldn't see the damn line
even if you wanted to.

39:51.780 --> 39:53.338
So you stay where you are.

39:55.690 --> 39:57.829
Barely able
to recognize yourself.

39:59.040 --> 40:01.656
Struggling to survive.

40:03.480 --> 40:06.005
Pull down innocent people
in the process, right?

40:07.360 --> 40:08.918
And some bad ones too.

40:10.490 --> 40:11.741
Guilty as charged.

40:13.360 --> 40:15.180
Well, you're next.

40:15.500 --> 40:16.660
[scoffs]

40:17.150 --> 40:18.845
You know the temptation.

40:20.240 --> 40:21.366
Don't you judge me.

40:21.980 --> 40:22.969
Nah.

40:23.020 --> 40:24.544
I'll leave that to a jury.

40:26.030 --> 40:28.021
Or the man or woman upstairs.

40:30.600 --> 40:32.465
I never set out to end up here.

40:33.030 --> 40:34.372
No one ever does.

40:36.040 --> 40:37.644
Which is why
I have a job to do,

40:38.950 --> 40:40.121
every single day.

40:44.180 --> 40:45.169
BILL: Pop the door.

40:45.220 --> 40:46.778
-[door buzzing]
-[door unlocks]

41:05.890 --> 41:07.061
BILL:
It's cold out.

41:07.630 --> 41:08.847
You shouldn't be out here.

41:09.550 --> 41:11.723
Hey, your old man's
a glutton for punishment.

41:13.200 --> 41:14.417
Unlike my son.

41:17.210 --> 41:19.986
You know the first time
I put you up on a horse...

41:21.870 --> 41:22.905
you cried.

41:23.480 --> 41:24.515
Oh, please.

41:25.040 --> 41:26.211
You did.

41:26.740 --> 41:28.469
You were no more than
a year old.

41:29.220 --> 41:30.346
If that.

41:30.400 --> 41:31.435
Don't you remember?

41:32.010 --> 41:33.261
Can't say that I do.

41:34.230 --> 41:35.219
I do.

41:36.710 --> 41:38.268
I walked you around on Shadow.

41:39.880 --> 41:41.484
[laughs]

41:41.890 --> 41:44.051
I had you shoot up
all the bad guys.

41:45.590 --> 41:47.103
Well, they're still out there.

41:48.410 --> 41:50.196
Found me a few more
of 'em today.

41:51.160 --> 41:53.321
Pissed a lot of people off
in the process.

41:54.420 --> 41:55.546
Ah, screw 'em.

41:57.250 --> 41:59.468
All that matters is
you went from your gut.

42:01.170 --> 42:02.421
Well, you taught me well.

42:07.430 --> 42:09.819
It's nice to get the credit
instead of the blame.

42:14.270 --> 42:15.259
Hey.

42:17.090 --> 42:18.307
You wanna go for a ride?

42:18.660 --> 42:19.615
No.

42:20.750 --> 42:23.002
They say I'm not
fit enough anymore.

42:24.150 --> 42:26.357
Well, we'll keep it
between us cowboys.

42:27.190 --> 42:28.236
How about that?

42:29.320 --> 42:30.537
Well, you're the sheriff.

42:32.240 --> 42:33.628
Hell, you look like a sheriff.

42:35.590 --> 42:36.579
Come on.

42:37.850 --> 42:39.374
What do you say, boy?

42:39.420 --> 42:41.945
There's a shadow
of something

42:43.080 --> 42:45.116
Can't quite make it out

42:46.120 --> 42:47.644
I can't make it out

42:50.130 --> 42:52.826
But there is hope
where there's love and

42:53.780 --> 42:55.691
I know we'll make it out

42:56.830 --> 42:59.742
We'll make it out 'cause...

42:59.790 --> 43:01.872
[humming]

43:03.840 --> 43:06.308
Tomorrow will be brighter

43:09.280 --> 43:11.100
It's a new day
