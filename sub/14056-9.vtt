00:00.002 --> 00:01.407
Previously on The O.C.:

00:01.425 --> 00:03.137
How would you like to go into business together?

00:03.238 --> 00:04.231
I don't need your charity.

00:04.310 --> 00:05.906
Then why are you living in a trailer?

00:05.995 --> 00:07.935
I don't want to go to Berkeley. I want to go to Brown.

00:08.012 --> 00:11.705
What if he goes to college and meets a bunch of really smart girls

00:11.796 --> 00:14.248
and realizes that that's who he's supposed to be with?

00:14.323 --> 00:15.674
- What the hell are you doing?
- Let me explain.

00:15.754 --> 00:17.806
You call people in on a Sunday to fire them.

00:17.894 --> 00:20.264
He likes you, and sooner or later, you're going to have to deal with it.

00:20.343 --> 00:21.881
Maybe you just don't understand what she's going through.

00:21.966 --> 00:22.871
You two talk, I'm done.

00:22.955 --> 00:23.725
Ryan!

00:25.125 --> 00:26.672
I feel responsible.

00:26.771 --> 00:29.726
I'm going to get the operation and get back on my board.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074

00:49.935 --> 00:51.464
You guys, seriously, thank you.

00:51.857 --> 00:53.210
Sure, we're happy to help.

00:53.306 --> 00:54.074
Not a problem, man.

00:54.159 --> 00:56.184
I'm just along for the ride, but you're welcome.

00:56.941 --> 00:58.285
You didn't have to do this.

00:59.263 --> 01:00.728
Come on. Yeah, we did.

01:01.288 --> 01:05.134
I mean, Chili's out of town, your mom's at work...

01:05.732 --> 01:07.146
We weren't going to let you take the bus.

01:07.247 --> 01:10.089
Yeah, taking the bus never seems to end up well around here.

01:10.307 --> 01:11.588
It's this one up on the right.

01:11.745 --> 01:13.234
The one with the white trim?

01:13.326 --> 01:15.230
No, it's the one next to it.

01:19.209 --> 01:20.500
The Infinity Pool's in the back.

01:20.591 --> 01:23.304
Dude, don't even worry about it. You should see where Ryan grew up.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.537
We're moving soon.

01:24.903 --> 01:27.221
After I go pro, a year on the circuit, save some money,

01:27.308 --> 01:29.283
buy my mom a house on the flower streets.

01:30.150 --> 01:32.179
I may seem a little optimistic now, but...

01:32.825 --> 01:33.684
No.

01:33.829 --> 01:34.587
Thanks again.

01:34.681 --> 01:35.811
Yeah, see you.

01:36.073 --> 01:37.329
Here, let me help you.

01:37.421 --> 01:38.797
No, I'm fine.

01:39.133 --> 01:40.788
You're all going to be late for school.

01:42.544 --> 01:43.653
Don't forget.

01:43.762 --> 01:44.823
Oh, thanks.

01:45.048 --> 01:46.236
- All right.
- Yeah.

01:52.939 --> 01:54.703
Okay, definitely not fine.

01:56.147 --> 01:57.272
I can't watch this.

01:57.370 --> 01:58.910
I have a free period right now.

01:59.013 --> 02:00.669
You should stay, help him get settled.

02:00.758 --> 02:01.366
You think?

02:01.444 --> 02:02.236
See you tonight.

02:02.325 --> 02:03.523
We'll catch up, get something to eat.

02:12.498 --> 02:13.551
Don't speak.

02:13.637 --> 02:14.857
The kid has no one.

02:15.915 --> 02:17.063
And I trust Marissa.

02:48.496 --> 02:54.309
So, I was thinking our new business could provide something that's missing in Newport.

02:54.721 --> 02:55.896
But we've got everything.

02:55.981 --> 02:57.278
Not a great bookstore.

02:57.809 --> 03:00.252
Latest fiction, authors giving readings...

03:00.331 --> 03:01.682
Ah, interesting.

03:01.769 --> 03:03.623
But I was thinking that our new business could provide

03:03.713 --> 03:06.034
something that Newport actually wants.

03:06.114 --> 03:07.852
Okay, Julie, what's your idea?

03:07.925 --> 03:10.408
Okay. I was reading in Stuff magazine about this service.

03:10.477 --> 03:12.316
We can get this girl come and clean your house.

03:12.396 --> 03:15.771
I think they're called housekeepers, and Newport is definitely on to that trend.

03:15.857 --> 03:18.205
Not housekeepers, nude maids.

03:18.731 --> 03:20.424
Who wants to see their maids nude?

03:20.503 --> 03:23.413
Not maids, Kirsten, they're strippers.

03:23.499 --> 03:25.366
Who wants a stripper doing their laundry?

03:25.443 --> 03:27.891
Well, as long as she knows how to iron my shirts the way I like them,

03:27.976 --> 03:29.852
wrinkle-free and not too starchy.

03:30.434 --> 03:32.977
Sandy gets it. Just a few weeks at the Newport Group,

03:33.055 --> 03:34.671
he's already thinking like a businessman.

03:34.766 --> 03:36.408
You've got to give the people what they want.

03:36.480 --> 03:38.519
Exactly. And right now I'm trying to give people

03:38.604 --> 03:40.326
without a lot of money a decent place to live.

03:40.398 --> 03:42.887
Matt set up a big meeting with some potential investors.

03:42.968 --> 03:46.324
Sandy, I don't think I'm in favor of low-income housing.

03:46.401 --> 03:48.260
Julie, you live in a trailer park.

03:48.414 --> 03:51.388
And I'm highly motivated to change my circumstances.

03:51.480 --> 03:55.074
If you make being poor too comfortable, what's the incentive to get rich?

03:55.164 --> 03:56.837
Believe me, if anyone should know...

03:57.253 --> 04:01.103
Well, on that uplifting note, I'll leave you two to hash out

04:01.181 --> 04:03.389
the finer points of the free-market economy.

04:05.425 --> 04:08.883
Look, why don't we do something that we know Newport needs

04:08.963 --> 04:10.501
and we're already good at.

04:11.421 --> 04:12.303
I'm blanking.

04:12.401 --> 04:13.508
Party planning.

04:14.323 --> 04:16.825
I'll cater charity events, private dinners...

04:16.922 --> 04:20.803
We know all the vendors, all the sites, already have a huge client base.

04:21.339 --> 04:22.320
I'm in.

04:27.241 --> 04:28.299
Has Marissa called?

04:28.890 --> 04:30.204
I just dropped her off.

04:30.417 --> 04:31.934
Why would she call? She's busy.

04:32.425 --> 04:34.638
Hey, guys. Can't talk. I have to go see Dr. Kim.

04:34.815 --> 04:35.656
You in trouble?

04:35.762 --> 04:38.682
No, I have to change my college file. I got my SAT score.

04:39.169 --> 04:41.273
Summer, we got our SAT scores back months ago.

04:41.352 --> 04:43.259
Oh, well, I took mine late, remember?

04:43.339 --> 04:45.648
There was a Valley marathon on the first time around.

04:45.843 --> 04:46.383
How'd you do?

04:46.462 --> 04:49.998
Ryan, come on. You never ask a lady her age, weight or SAT score.

04:50.092 --> 04:51.504
I got a 2300.

04:53.130 --> 04:54.439
What, that bad?

04:55.030 --> 04:57.229
That... good.

04:57.317 --> 04:58.829
Hmm? As good as you, Cohen?

04:58.920 --> 04:59.379
Better.

04:59.461 --> 05:02.402
By just the tiniest bit.

05:03.338 --> 05:07.600
You know, I read a study once that said that if 1,500 third-graders took the SAT,

05:07.679 --> 05:10.206
one would get a perfect score by probability alone.

05:10.287 --> 05:11.002
Yeah.

05:11.101 --> 05:12.284
I'm not a third-grader, Cohen.

05:12.386 --> 05:15.327
No, no, I'm not saying you are. But, I mean, how else do you explain it?

05:15.903 --> 05:16.933
I don't know.

05:19.067 --> 05:20.745
How is that even possible?

05:20.867 --> 05:22.373
She did save Chrismukkah.

05:26.496 --> 05:32.110
Okay, so you've got your blanket pillows, um, what else?

05:32.198 --> 05:35.095
The remote, magazines...

05:35.179 --> 05:37.580
All right, just call me if you need anything, okay?

05:37.665 --> 05:38.920
Don't wait by the phone.

05:40.580 --> 05:42.595
I mean, since you pretty much thought of everything.

05:42.682 --> 05:45.016
Well, maybe I should stop by after school. Give you your homework.

05:45.104 --> 05:46.120
I'll get it later.

05:47.448 --> 05:48.730
Is everything okay?

05:48.843 --> 05:51.185
Because if I didn't know any better, I'd think you were trying to get rid of me.

05:52.342 --> 05:53.746
Whatever you could do would help.

05:53.833 --> 05:54.814
Ma, hey.

05:54.924 --> 05:57.725
Please, call me when you have some information. Thanks again.

05:58.142 --> 05:59.604
Hi, baby, how you feeling?

05:59.700 --> 06:00.734
Okay. Ma, this is...

06:00.834 --> 06:02.295
The famous Marissa Cooper.

06:02.406 --> 06:03.134
Hi.

06:03.981 --> 06:05.080
Come here, sweetie.

06:05.223 --> 06:08.946
Oh, Johnny talks about you so much, I feel like I know you already.

06:10.299 --> 06:13.088
You didn't tell me she was gorgeous.

06:13.190 --> 06:14.548
Ma, you're embarrassing her.

06:14.645 --> 06:15.508
Sorry.

06:16.776 --> 06:18.559
Listen, thank you for bringing him home.

06:18.657 --> 06:20.560
I tried to get someone to cover for me at the nursing home,

06:20.641 --> 06:22.654
but no one wants the night shift. Go figure.

06:22.745 --> 06:24.633
Mom, Marissa has to get to class. You're going to make her late.

06:24.723 --> 06:27.089
Just wait. I've got some good news.

06:27.184 --> 06:28.923
I got you an appointment...

06:29.257 --> 06:33.160
with the best sports medicine doctor in all of Orange County.

06:33.247 --> 06:37.658
A real fancy orthopedic surgeon, works with the Angels and the Ducks.

06:37.735 --> 06:38.470
Thanks, Mom.

06:38.560 --> 06:39.675
One hitch.

06:40.295 --> 06:42.845
Being that he's so in demand, there's a wait list,

06:42.936 --> 06:45.055
and the wait's going to be a little while.

06:45.645 --> 06:47.030
What, like a week?

06:47.127 --> 06:49.029
It seemed kind of more like months.

06:49.916 --> 06:52.434
But the team will be gone then. I'll miss the tour.

06:52.548 --> 06:54.630
I know, honey, but there's always next year.

06:54.723 --> 06:56.471
And maybe there's a way to get moved up on the list.

06:56.559 --> 06:57.729
No, no, I tried.

06:57.826 --> 07:01.848
But you know, they give these favors to friends and donors to the hospital.

07:02.645 --> 07:03.670
Babe...

07:04.795 --> 07:07.790
I'm sorry. I did the best I could.

07:15.901 --> 07:17.345
- Hi.
- Hey.

07:17.467 --> 07:21.744
You're not going to believe this. So it turns out that I am totally smart.

07:21.834 --> 07:23.589
Yeah, you are. In your own way.

07:23.694 --> 07:25.972
Not in my own way, in your way, too.

07:26.073 --> 07:29.856
Apparently, I have a lot of what they call "aptitude."

07:29.908 --> 07:30.466
Really?

07:30.557 --> 07:33.440
Dr. Kim told me that, like, every few years she has a female student

07:33.529 --> 07:36.988
that turns out to be, like, academically gifted, but just didn't apply herself.

07:37.067 --> 07:40.922
You know, just focusing more on boys and shopping and celebrity gossip.

07:41.015 --> 07:43.804
But she said if I study for my finals, I could get my grades up enough

07:43.873 --> 07:45.757
to go to Brown with you.

07:45.879 --> 07:47.404
Wouldn't that be awesome?

07:47.490 --> 07:51.916
Yeah. Sure, but, you know, do you want to go to Brown?

07:51.995 --> 07:52.985
Now I do.

07:53.091 --> 07:54.926
Dr. Kim said that you can make your own major.

07:55.004 --> 07:58.269
And the school colors are seal brown. How cute are seals?

07:58.556 --> 08:02.527
And then look, they're having this thing tomorrow, for prospective students,

08:02.595 --> 08:04.276
and I thought we could go together.

08:04.533 --> 08:06.156
Okay, yeah.

08:06.249 --> 08:08.304
Mm. Sounds like a date.

08:09.526 --> 08:10.459
Okay.

08:11.195 --> 08:12.145
What you reading?

08:12.229 --> 08:12.908
Hmm?

08:13.007 --> 08:16.088
Oh, it's just  Fear and Trembling. It's Kierkegaard.

08:17.703 --> 08:22.868
He's the godfather of existentialism. Sort of invented the concept of angst.

08:23.702 --> 08:25.959
Well, now that I'm smart, I'm sure I'll enjoy it.

08:32.827 --> 08:36.865
All right, I'll do the welcome, explain our philosophy, present the model...

08:37.020 --> 08:38.315
I'll follow up with the numbers.

08:38.405 --> 08:39.784
What about Thai for dinner?

08:39.871 --> 08:41.186
Sounds great.

08:41.265 --> 08:43.051
Happy days are here again.

08:44.293 --> 08:46.103
You two are so perfect together.

08:46.178 --> 08:47.526
It's almost painful to be around.

08:47.617 --> 08:49.596
Well, we've been working on it for about 25 years.

08:49.670 --> 08:51.816
You're bound to get it right eventually.

08:51.912 --> 08:54.188
What about you? There's a girlfriend in Chicago?

08:54.271 --> 08:55.814
Yeah, yeah.

08:55.947 --> 08:56.848
She's a great girl.

08:56.929 --> 08:58.512
I look forward to meeting her.

08:59.191 --> 09:02.183
Well, here's a couple of guys who know a thing or two about romance.

09:02.273 --> 09:03.824
Seth, Ryan, meet Matt Ramsey.

09:03.948 --> 09:04.349
Hey.

09:04.424 --> 09:05.972
- Matt, meet my boys.
- Hey, there.

09:06.049 --> 09:08.875
Matt and I are working on the proposal for our affordable housing development.

09:08.948 --> 09:11.419
Oh, that's my cue to go help Mom with dinner.

09:11.688 --> 09:12.939
This is it, huh?

09:13.057 --> 09:14.073
Yep.

09:14.273 --> 09:16.342
It's an early version, but pretty much.

09:17.055 --> 09:19.381
You guys probably don't want my two cents, but, uh...

09:19.449 --> 09:20.717
What? No, no, no, go ahead.

09:20.798 --> 09:24.680
Well, you put a wall up here, it turns this whole space into a courtyard.

09:24.774 --> 09:27.227
Add some benches, a playground, good idea.

09:27.327 --> 09:28.622
It's just a thought.

09:29.453 --> 09:30.569
You're a senior, right?

09:30.641 --> 09:31.464
Applying to college?

09:31.542 --> 09:32.172
Yeah.

09:32.269 --> 09:34.068
What would look better on a resume than an internship

09:34.140 --> 09:36.429
with a prestigious development company?

09:36.513 --> 09:37.930
I mean, if it's cool with the boss.

09:38.007 --> 09:39.092
We could use the help.

09:39.183 --> 09:40.010
You got any plans tonight?

09:40.099 --> 09:41.610
Uh, yeah, my girlfriend.

09:41.688 --> 09:42.973
Cancel them.

09:45.620 --> 09:48.297
Well, this is the doctor's home page,

09:48.399 --> 09:50.999
and it says here he works out of Hogue Hospital.

09:51.091 --> 09:54.653
My mom done a bunch of charities for them and Summer's dad even works there.

09:54.721 --> 09:56.676
So this is kind of perfect.

09:57.596 --> 10:01.154
Marissa, I appreciate everything, but...

10:02.371 --> 10:04.288
you can't do this.

10:04.508 --> 10:05.267
Why?

10:05.344 --> 10:07.741
Because I might one day decide to become a surfer,

10:07.813 --> 10:09.686
get hit by a bus, need surgery,

10:09.761 --> 10:13.087
and then realize I used my one good favor with the best doctor in town?

10:13.260 --> 10:15.445
Yeah, I don't think that's going to happen.

10:16.841 --> 10:19.303
I just don't want you to think this is your problem.

10:20.222 --> 10:22.719
Too late. Hang on. Summer's picking me up.

10:24.146 --> 10:25.835
Oops, sorry.

10:28.622 --> 10:29.473
Hey.

10:29.586 --> 10:30.935
Hey. You ready to go?

10:31.238 --> 10:32.761
Oh, hang on.

10:33.721 --> 10:36.764
Oh, it's Ryan. We're supposed to have dinner tonight, I should...

10:39.323 --> 10:40.280
Hi.

10:40.406 --> 10:41.928
You have to help me.

10:42.046 --> 10:44.016
I thought Marissa was helping you.

10:44.088 --> 10:47.268
She is. She's driving me, feeding me, bringing me my homework.

10:47.342 --> 10:49.727
Now she's trying to get me in with some doctor.

10:50.092 --> 10:52.607
Well, she's a good friend. I don't see the problem.

10:52.692 --> 10:55.050
She's too nice. She's spending too much time with me.

10:55.126 --> 10:57.030
Well, she tends to be a little clingy.

10:57.107 --> 10:59.430
No, it's not that I don't like it.

11:00.313 --> 11:01.946
It's that I do.

11:02.677 --> 11:03.564
A lot.

11:03.652 --> 11:07.292
I called this, like, so long ago. This, this is a major problem.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.080
Not for anybody but me, okay?

11:09.163 --> 11:11.084
Just don't tell anyone.

11:11.570 --> 11:12.773
Promise?

11:13.449 --> 11:14.606
Yeah.

11:15.341 --> 11:16.492
What I miss?

11:18.825 --> 11:20.539
Thanks for droping me, Sum.

11:20.634 --> 11:22.565
Hey, you think maybe you could pick me up, too?

11:22.648 --> 11:24.355
Oh, maybe you should ask Ryan.

11:24.439 --> 11:26.597
Oh, I think he's gonna go to the Newport Group after school.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.148
Oh, I guess I could swing by Union.

11:28.238 --> 11:29.984
Oh, actually, can you pick me up at Johnny's?

11:30.066 --> 11:31.440
'Cause I'm gonna drop off his homework,

11:31.510 --> 11:34.395
and hopefully, he'll know about the doctor by then.

11:34.562 --> 11:37.753
Hey, you think maybe you could ask your dad to put in a good word?

11:37.806 --> 11:38.573
Yeah, I guess.

11:38.657 --> 11:43.071
Are you sure, I don't know, that that's the best idea?

11:43.303 --> 11:45.351
You being all involved in Johnny's life?

11:45.429 --> 11:46.751
You guys are getting really close.

11:46.844 --> 11:49.741
Yeah, well, he doesn't really have anyone else.

11:49.816 --> 11:51.667
I mean, his mom's sweet, but it just seems like

11:51.737 --> 11:53.516
everything's kind of hard for her, you know?

11:53.592 --> 11:54.745
I'm just trying to help.

11:54.836 --> 11:56.641
Okay, I'll talk to my dad.

11:56.726 --> 11:58.436
You know, the sooner that Johnny gets on his feet,

11:58.502 --> 12:00.257
the sooner you don't have to be his nursemaid.

12:00.345 --> 12:02.513
I kind of like being his nursemaid.

12:02.621 --> 12:04.588
You know, maybe I should be a nurse.

12:06.381 --> 12:07.636
That is a good one.

12:07.750 --> 12:09.824
So was Marissa totally cool with you canceling on her last night?

12:09.907 --> 12:11.272
Didn't have a problem with it.

12:11.458 --> 12:12.898
But do you have a problem with it?

12:12.994 --> 12:14.375
I canceled on her.

12:14.460 --> 12:16.346
Yeah, but if you canceled on me, I'd have a problem with it.

12:16.421 --> 12:18.934
And, you know, if I canceled on you and you didn't have a problem with it,

12:19.009 --> 12:20.287
then I might have a problem with that.

12:20.360 --> 12:23.318
Sounds like you already got a problem-- and not with me.

12:23.891 --> 12:24.872
Who would my problem be with?

12:24.942 --> 12:26.941
I don't know, 'cause I think it's really great that Summer's a genius.

12:27.007 --> 12:27.848
Whoa.

12:27.918 --> 12:29.110
Whoa, whoa.

12:29.143 --> 12:31.472
Listen, Dr. Kim said she had some untapped potential,

12:31.550 --> 12:33.759
and no one went around using the "G" word.

12:33.966 --> 12:35.213
Don't do this, man.

12:35.305 --> 12:36.370
Do what?

12:36.491 --> 12:37.243
Compete with Summer.

12:37.323 --> 12:40.537
Why, because you think... Summer would win?

12:43.420 --> 12:46.445
So I figured out what our startup costs will be.

12:46.527 --> 12:48.485
Do you want to share an appetizer? Crap cakes?

12:48.571 --> 12:49.534
Sounds good.

12:49.627 --> 12:52.129
We can charge food and liquor on a per-event basis.

12:52.218 --> 12:55.824
Dishes and linen, we have to figure out whether it's worth buying our own or not.

12:55.926 --> 12:58.868
Mm, you know what I'm really craving? The sweet corn ravioli.

12:58.932 --> 13:00.800
Or do you think that'll be too heavy with the crab cakes?

13:00.863 --> 13:04.223
What I think is, is that you don't find this business very interesting.

13:04.377 --> 13:05.884
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:06.660 --> 13:10.359
Kiki, I've just been eating a lot of ramen lately.

13:10.803 --> 13:12.784
Julie, if this business works,

13:12.862 --> 13:15.063
you'll never have to boil your dinner again.

13:18.021 --> 13:19.844
I had a supplier list.

13:20.807 --> 13:22.422
I left it in the car.

13:22.915 --> 13:23.766
I'll be right back.

13:23.852 --> 13:25.697
I'll decide on my order while you're gone.

13:26.282 --> 13:28.774
Or... read some spreadsheets.

13:28.807 --> 13:29.901
Right here.

13:45.049 --> 13:47.954
So I see you're suddenly without a lunch date.

13:48.049 --> 13:49.939
Would you like to join me at the bar for a drink?

13:50.030 --> 13:52.190
No, my friend will be back shortly.

13:52.587 --> 13:54.635
Well, maybe I could buy you both drinks.

13:54.951 --> 13:58.623
Well, she's an alcoholic, and, uh, we're having a business lunch.

13:58.706 --> 14:00.017
We're partners.

14:00.570 --> 14:01.939
In a business.

14:02.767 --> 14:03.857
Really.

14:04.755 --> 14:06.142
What kind of business?

14:07.824 --> 14:08.850
Well...

14:24.377 --> 14:25.610
Hey, Julie.

14:25.693 --> 14:26.811
Kirsten!

14:26.907 --> 14:28.533
Oh, this is Jeff Grenzel.

14:28.638 --> 14:30.749
This is my business partner, Kirsten Cohen.

14:30.835 --> 14:32.190
Nice to meet you.

14:32.280 --> 14:35.362
Uh, we were in the middle of something, if you'll excuse us.

14:35.449 --> 14:39.108
Actually, I invited Jeff to join us for lunch.

14:40.446 --> 14:44.223
He just hired us to do a dinner party at his house this weekend.

14:44.656 --> 14:46.334
For $5,000.

14:47.894 --> 14:50.130
Oh, well, have a seat.

14:53.148 --> 14:54.667
Do you like crab cakes?

14:54.769 --> 14:56.979
Hey, Ashley, Madison.

14:57.053 --> 14:59.108
- Summer, hey.
- What's up?

14:59.194 --> 15:02.380
Didn't expect to see you here, at a Brown event. No offense.

15:02.468 --> 15:03.691
Oh, none taken.

15:07.903 --> 15:09.793
Hey, you know, maybe we should just leave.

15:09.898 --> 15:10.834
Why?

15:11.521 --> 15:13.612
Well, you know...

15:14.120 --> 15:15.832
You don't think I belong here.

15:15.942 --> 15:18.737
No, it's not that, it's just, you know, you don't have to do this for me.

15:18.825 --> 15:20.698
Oh, this isn't about you.

15:21.986 --> 15:23.106
It isn't?

15:23.225 --> 15:26.282
Because this has been my dream for years, and, I mean...

15:26.374 --> 15:28.160
all of a sudden it's yours, too?

15:29.672 --> 15:31.928
Well, maybe I never had a dream.

15:32.033 --> 15:36.147
You know, maybe for once in my life, I actually want to do something with my life,

15:36.231 --> 15:38.058
like something important.

15:38.331 --> 15:41.926
Be the first woman in space, or win one of those noble prizes.

15:42.005 --> 15:44.403
Summer, women have been going to space since the '60s,

15:44.479 --> 15:47.566
and it's not noble prize, it's Nobel.

15:47.814 --> 15:51.410
Marie Curie won in 1903 for discovering radium.

15:54.388 --> 15:57.231
- Well, I think you've made your point.
- Hey, hey, hey, don't leave.

15:57.308 --> 15:58.434
Oh, I'm not leaving.

15:58.529 --> 16:02.558
Look, you may know more about history and science and stuff, but...

16:02.650 --> 16:05.108
I know a thing or two about working a room.

16:05.437 --> 16:06.869
Hey, Madison.

16:07.321 --> 16:08.515
Wait up.

16:15.731 --> 16:16.770
You all right?

16:17.614 --> 16:18.411
Yeah.

16:19.834 --> 16:21.297
Uh, I just got a lot on my mind.

16:21.795 --> 16:23.740
I promised it wouldn't interfere with my work.

16:23.833 --> 16:25.410
Job means a lot to you, huh?

16:25.499 --> 16:26.948
Kind of means everything.

16:29.415 --> 16:32.325
I relocated to do this with Sandy.

16:32.561 --> 16:34.394
And my girlfriend, uh...

16:34.485 --> 16:37.179
Well, my ex now, I guess, so...

16:37.277 --> 16:42.148
I took her down to Cabo last weekend and invited her to join me here, as my wife.

16:42.695 --> 16:45.094
It turns out she doesn't like warm weather...

16:45.483 --> 16:46.554
or me.

16:46.658 --> 16:47.721
Have you told Sandy this?

16:47.811 --> 16:49.116
It's not his problem.

16:49.515 --> 16:50.901
Sandy's a good guy.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.835
He's taking a big chance on me.

16:53.090 --> 16:54.261
I don't want to let him down.

16:54.307 --> 16:55.675
Yeah, tell me about it.

16:57.564 --> 17:00.160
Guys, I hate to do this to you, but my plate's full.

17:00.229 --> 17:02.137
Whatever it is, put it right out of your mind.

17:02.224 --> 17:03.371
Ryan and I are on it. It's already done.

17:03.457 --> 17:06.464
There's legislation in the works that would change the zoning at the site.

17:06.540 --> 17:08.498
I need you to work out both scenarios.

17:08.578 --> 17:10.901
One if it passes, one if it doesn't.

17:15.002 --> 17:17.002
That means twice the work.

17:19.087 --> 17:20.671
Maybe you could reschedule the meeting?

17:20.759 --> 17:23.703
I would if I could, but I can't; these guys are coming tomorrow, on a Saturday,

17:23.790 --> 17:27.563
and then heading straight down to San Diego to look at another development.

17:27.664 --> 17:30.018
14 hours, laptop, coffee.

17:30.113 --> 17:31.247
Ryan and I are good to go.

17:31.333 --> 17:32.513
That's the spirit.

17:32.699 --> 17:33.814
Thanks.

17:36.856 --> 17:39.797
Hey, are we gonna have time to get ready? 'Cause if not, we should tell him now.

17:39.826 --> 17:42.743
Uh, come on, we'll take a little field trip.

17:44.413 --> 17:46.795
You guys, next year is gonna be so much fun.

17:46.887 --> 17:49.921
You know, maybe we should drive together, like, have a road trip?

17:50.017 --> 17:50.649
Shotgun.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.986
Excuse me. If I could have your attention, please?

17:53.068 --> 17:55.257
I want to thank you all for coming. Great group.

17:55.343 --> 17:55.956
So true.

17:56.043 --> 18:00.688
But unfortunately, on average, Brown only admits one student a year from Harbor,

18:00.774 --> 18:02.086
and it's stiff competition.

18:02.178 --> 18:03.569
I wish I could admit you all.

18:03.665 --> 18:06.519
But enjoy the events, and good luck.

18:09.646 --> 18:10.807
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

18:10.895 --> 18:12.366
No, I need to talk to the Brown guy.

18:12.465 --> 18:16.958
Hey, hi. Um, I was wondering, in your opinion, what makes a student stand out?

18:17.034 --> 18:18.772
Yes, besides good grades.

18:18.859 --> 18:20.308
And high SAT scores.

18:20.398 --> 18:23.328
Well, all our applicants are leaders at their schools.

18:23.409 --> 18:25.435
What it really takes is a hook.

18:25.538 --> 18:26.797
Fascinating.

18:26.909 --> 18:28.207
Okay, okay.

18:28.291 --> 18:30.047
Could you clarify with an example?

18:30.144 --> 18:30.945
Sure.

18:33.599 --> 18:35.120
Next week!

18:35.810 --> 18:38.343
That is great news. I can't believe it.

18:38.428 --> 18:40.034
It's really not that big a deal.

18:40.107 --> 18:42.716
You know, it turns out Summer's dad's a plastic surgeon at the same hospital,

18:42.783 --> 18:44.425
and they just knew each other.

18:44.773 --> 18:46.457
I'm glad it worked out, though.

18:47.181 --> 18:49.607
This calls for some kind of celebration.

18:49.696 --> 18:51.392
Marissa, you're staying for dinner.

18:51.487 --> 18:53.018
Mom, I'm sure she has plans.

18:53.116 --> 18:55.782
Oh, I do, actually, with Ryan.

18:55.865 --> 18:57.423
That's her boyfriend.

18:57.512 --> 18:58.646
Well, invite him, too.

18:58.732 --> 19:02.679
We'll-we'll order in. We'll play board games or watch movies.

19:04.373 --> 19:05.549
That's him.

19:05.658 --> 19:07.107
Probably wondering where you are.

19:07.192 --> 19:08.417
No, he knows.

19:08.948 --> 19:12.842
Hey. So do you want to come over to Johnny's and get take-out and DVDs?

19:12.918 --> 19:13.896
We're gonna celebrate.

19:13.983 --> 19:14.955
Yeah.

19:15.168 --> 19:16.770
Yeah, okay, that sounds good.

19:16.867 --> 19:20.427
You should... probably start without me, though.

19:21.523 --> 19:22.887
I'll be there as soon as I can.

19:26.582 --> 19:28.481
It's cool. He's with me.

19:28.605 --> 19:29.692
Sure thing, boss.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.357
Hey, what are we doing, man?

19:42.436 --> 19:44.357
I thought we were gonna go on a coffee run or something.

19:44.446 --> 19:45.892
I never said that.

19:46.543 --> 19:48.081
Do some of my best thinking here, man.

19:48.169 --> 19:49.136
I can see why.

19:49.229 --> 19:51.555
Loud music, topless women, no distractions at all.

19:51.637 --> 19:55.393
Sometimes a good distraction is the best way to recharge.

19:55.623 --> 19:56.595
Right? And here's my muse.

19:56.683 --> 19:57.169
Lily.

19:57.254 --> 19:58.657
Hey, Matt!

19:59.206 --> 20:01.106
How's my favorite customer doing?

20:01.192 --> 20:03.020
I'm in need of some serious one-on-one time.

20:03.107 --> 20:05.755
Mm, should I ready the Champagne Room for you?

20:07.899 --> 20:10.123
Hey, come on, man.

20:10.210 --> 20:11.371
I got this, all right?

20:11.463 --> 20:12.584
We're just gonna have a little time-out,

20:12.673 --> 20:14.339
then we go back to the office and pull an all-nighter.

20:14.425 --> 20:16.560
I got plans. I can't... I...

20:19.769 --> 20:21.310
First dance is on me.

20:21.407 --> 20:22.376
I'll be right back.

20:26.423 --> 20:28.949
Hi. I'm Sipowitz.

20:29.118 --> 20:30.470
Hi, Sipowitz.

20:33.452 --> 20:36.136
I didn't know Julie was taking this seriously.

20:36.345 --> 20:39.046
Well, you got to hand it to her, she's a born entrepreneur.

20:39.122 --> 20:41.382
Hey, I'm starving.

20:41.448 --> 20:42.835
And that actually smells good.

20:42.915 --> 20:45.823
Well, it's not for you. Pizza's coming.

20:46.380 --> 20:48.028
Is that a pirate costume?

20:48.121 --> 20:49.851
Summer and I are in a war.

20:49.945 --> 20:50.932
A pirate war?

20:51.030 --> 20:53.740
Well, it turns out Brown usually takes only one student from Harbor,

20:53.840 --> 20:55.555
and we both want to be it, so I need a hook.

20:55.652 --> 20:57.713
Oh, you mean like Captain Hook.

20:59.797 --> 21:01.926
I'll get that; maybe it's dinner.

21:06.801 --> 21:08.957
Summer going to Brown?

21:09.217 --> 21:10.639
I mean, no offense...

21:10.722 --> 21:12.362
She did save Chrismukkah.

21:13.394 --> 21:14.567
Is Ryan eating with us?

21:14.655 --> 21:16.015
No, he's working with Matt tonight.

21:16.096 --> 21:17.481
I think he's a good influence on Ryan;

21:17.556 --> 21:21.427
you know, he's young, he didn't come from much, he's making something of himself.

21:21.915 --> 21:23.434
He's a good role model.

21:29.908 --> 21:31.084
You don't have to do this.

21:31.163 --> 21:32.603
Already bought and paid for.

21:32.690 --> 21:35.167
Oh, that's mine. My cell. It's ringing in my pocket.

21:35.264 --> 21:38.082
Mmm, I definitely feel something vibrating.

21:38.194 --> 21:39.347
Yeah, if you could just, uh...

21:39.434 --> 21:41.918
No. Let me.

21:54.505 --> 21:56.221
Hi. It's Ryan, leave a message.

21:56.307 --> 21:58.908
Hey, uh, it's me.

21:59.307 --> 22:02.081
I was just wondering where you are, so,

22:02.348 --> 22:04.653
um, it's getting kind of late.

22:04.968 --> 22:06.917
So call me.

24:11.304 --> 24:12.158
Where have you been?

24:12.238 --> 24:13.689
Whoa, Summer.

24:13.793 --> 24:15.985
I have been worried sick for hours.

24:16.276 --> 24:19.657
Well, since my alarm went off 20 minutes ago and I noticed you weren't here.

24:19.755 --> 24:21.597
Sorry, I fell asleep.

24:21.679 --> 24:23.016
Oh, at Ryan's?

24:23.863 --> 24:24.994
At Johnny's.

24:25.896 --> 24:27.228
At Johnny's?

24:27.415 --> 24:29.261
We were watching a movie.

24:31.682 --> 24:32.816
What's that?

24:36.043 --> 24:36.912
A tuba.

24:37.008 --> 24:38.733
Which you have, why?

24:39.675 --> 24:41.190
Because I do.

24:42.522 --> 24:45.699
Because in fifth grade, you know, when I said I was going to beauty pageant camp,

24:45.781 --> 24:49.286
I was going to band camp and learning to play the tuba.

24:49.515 --> 24:50.964
- Wh...?
- Wait, quit changing the subject.

24:51.039 --> 24:53.070
I cannot believe you slept there. Does Ryan know?

24:53.148 --> 24:54.125
Know what?

24:57.643 --> 25:00.803
Uh, how bad that movie was last night.

25:01.061 --> 25:02.239
Where were you?

25:02.624 --> 25:04.869
Yeah, where were you?

25:06.731 --> 25:08.543
None of my business.

25:11.442 --> 25:13.789
Uh, I was with Matt. Uh, we were working.

25:13.891 --> 25:14.913
Wow, so late?

25:15.007 --> 25:16.672
Yeah, big presentation today.

25:16.764 --> 25:18.042
So, movie no good, huh?

25:18.143 --> 25:20.051
Yeah, well, it kind of put me to sleep.

25:21.109 --> 25:22.565
Uh... how's Johnny?

25:22.662 --> 25:24.651
Uh, better, I think.

25:24.808 --> 25:26.213
Good, good.

25:26.302 --> 25:27.248
Get home okay?

25:27.325 --> 25:30.080
Uh, yeah, yeah, his mom drove me.

25:31.277 --> 25:32.557
I just wanted to say hi.

25:32.655 --> 25:33.939
Yeah, don't let me keep you.

25:34.032 --> 25:34.928
Okay.

25:38.434 --> 25:42.340
Matt, the investors are in the conference room. I need your part of the presentation.

25:42.426 --> 25:43.866
Call me when you get this.

25:43.990 --> 25:46.578
Matt's missing in action. Any idea where he could be?

25:46.669 --> 25:49.374
Uh, he was pulling an all-nighter, maybe he slept in...

25:49.456 --> 25:51.482
Right through the alarm. Sorry, Sandy.

25:51.588 --> 25:52.207
Ready?

25:52.293 --> 25:55.551
As I'll ever be. Just let me put my tie on, clear my head. Five minutes?

25:55.641 --> 25:58.232
You've got four, and you might want to run a comb through your hair.

26:00.862 --> 26:02.000
Thanks for not busting me.

26:02.100 --> 26:03.701
You gonna make me wish I did?

26:03.818 --> 26:05.966
I know these guys, man. I got it under control.

26:08.357 --> 26:10.037
- Summer?
- Oh, hey, Ash.

26:10.118 --> 26:12.048
- You're not in the band. 
- Well, no, technically not.

26:12.139 --> 26:15.265
But I thought I could play the tuba, blow a few minds, maybe get asked to join.

26:15.336 --> 26:18.448
I'm a big fan of physical comedy and I'm extremely limber,

26:18.522 --> 26:21.821
plus Johnny Depp has been a huge inspiration in my life.

26:21.900 --> 26:25.673
I just think he's taking the pirate thing to just a whole new level, and...

26:25.753 --> 26:27.305
the brown bear is retiring next year.

26:27.353 --> 26:29.665
I told you, we already have a mascot.

26:29.756 --> 26:30.980
Oh, my God.

26:31.080 --> 26:32.322
And what's with the peg leg?

26:32.421 --> 26:33.231
Why?

26:33.314 --> 26:34.875
It's really creeping me out.

26:36.166 --> 26:37.150
Cohen!

26:37.680 --> 26:40.119
Cohen, what are you doing?

26:41.024 --> 26:42.248
Summer, what are you doing?

26:42.349 --> 26:43.438
I asked first.

26:43.538 --> 26:46.111
You know what? You don't need to answer that, because it's obvious.

26:46.202 --> 26:48.147
Yeah, I'm not the one wearing a tuba.

26:48.243 --> 26:50.931
Oh, that's really big talk from a guy wearing hoop earrings.

26:51.021 --> 26:52.476
At least I play the tuba.

26:53.388 --> 26:54.573
What? I do.

26:55.488 --> 26:57.875
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to practice.

27:00.581 --> 27:01.408
Ow!

27:01.505 --> 27:02.688
Did you just whack me with your tuba?

27:02.776 --> 27:04.718
Did you just jab me with your peg leg?

27:04.800 --> 27:06.234
It was a tap, you little whacker.

27:06.328 --> 27:08.524
It was a jab, jabber!

27:11.039 --> 27:13.981
Why do you have to be better than me at everything?

27:14.079 --> 27:15.410
See, that's just it, Summer.

27:15.524 --> 27:18.078
I'm not better than you at everything.

27:20.649 --> 27:23.007
There was one thing that I was better at.

27:29.905 --> 27:34.469
And the commercial space at street level can provide jobs, places to eat, a daycare center.

27:34.561 --> 27:37.518
Sounds good, Mr. Cohen, but we've heard there are regulations in the works

27:37.603 --> 27:40.001
which could complicate things.

27:40.087 --> 27:43.274
So have we. Matt's worked out both sets of numbers. Matt?

27:43.549 --> 27:44.742
Thanks, Sandy.

27:44.842 --> 27:49.413
So if the legislation does not pass, the profit model will look something like this.

27:49.427 --> 27:50.457
And if it does?

27:50.534 --> 27:54.603
Um, then we would have to decrease the amount of commercial space,

27:54.696 --> 27:57.234
which would, um... decrease the revenue.

27:57.328 --> 27:58.705
By how much, do you think?

27:59.264 --> 28:01.338
I would say a significant amount.

28:02.625 --> 28:04.606
Matt, we do business in dollars.

28:04.692 --> 28:06.326
How many we talking about here?

28:11.110 --> 28:12.259
I'm...

28:12.359 --> 28:15.774
Well, we haven't worked out those numbers right now.

28:15.954 --> 28:19.381
We didn't drive all the way down here for a hypothetical conversation.

28:19.454 --> 28:21.654
Of course you didn't. We'll have those numbers to you by this afternoon.

28:21.730 --> 28:22.784
Right, Matt?

28:25.339 --> 28:30.686
Well, thank you, Mr. Cohen, for your impressive presentation.

28:31.233 --> 28:33.230
I think we've heard all we need to today.

28:34.522 --> 28:35.767
Well, thanks for your time.

28:43.700 --> 28:45.517
I'm sorry. Uh, I...

28:54.069 --> 28:55.950
Anything you'd care to tell me?

28:59.892 --> 29:01.215
Coming.

29:05.189 --> 29:06.291
Johnny?

29:06.631 --> 29:07.778
In here!

29:09.994 --> 29:11.304
Oh, my God.

29:11.785 --> 29:12.928
Oh, God.

29:13.023 --> 29:14.342
All right, come on, here.

29:15.013 --> 29:16.552
I think I twisted it again.

29:16.677 --> 29:19.872
Okay, come on. Where are your painkillers?

29:24.108 --> 29:24.825
Hello.

29:24.920 --> 29:25.721
Good evening.

29:25.807 --> 29:26.839
Good evening.

29:27.187 --> 29:32.100
Oh, oh, Jeff. What a beautiful, beautiful place.

29:32.139 --> 29:32.734
Thank you.

29:32.821 --> 29:35.243
Do you and your guests want dinner in the dining room, or...

29:35.339 --> 29:36.747
Oh, the terrace would be nice.

29:36.837 --> 29:38.944
Uh, let me ask my guest.

29:39.299 --> 29:41.477
Dining room or terrace?

29:43.158 --> 29:44.376
Excuse me?

29:45.042 --> 29:46.576
I haven't invited anyone.

29:46.672 --> 29:49.750
I was hoping, Julie, that you might join me for dinner.

29:50.838 --> 29:54.147
Uh... Mr. Grenzel, if this is a joke, it's not funny.

29:54.184 --> 29:57.383
I've spent two days cooking, and Julie bought out the flower mart.

29:57.466 --> 29:58.667
One dinner, please.

29:58.762 --> 29:59.914
I'll pay what I promised.

30:00.006 --> 30:02.189
I just want the chance to get to know you better.

30:06.894 --> 30:08.379
Julie, we're leaving.

30:11.042 --> 30:11.979
Julie.

30:13.061 --> 30:16.224
You did all this for a date with me?

30:29.028 --> 30:31.266
Fine, but you're serving yourselves.

30:35.148 --> 30:36.097
Hungry?

30:36.176 --> 30:37.315
Nope.

30:49.444 --> 30:50.762
What the hell happened?

30:51.485 --> 30:52.615
I'm... I'm so sorry.

30:52.693 --> 30:55.190
That you weren't prepared for the meeting, I could maybe overlook.

30:55.269 --> 30:59.075
That you were here, that you brought Ryan here really tries my patience.

30:59.154 --> 31:00.270
But I'd hear you out.

31:00.358 --> 31:01.353
Thanks.

31:01.492 --> 31:02.349
That means a lot.

31:02.431 --> 31:04.009
But you lied to my face.

31:04.092 --> 31:06.464
You disrespected me, and the company I'm trying to build,

31:06.544 --> 31:08.497
the one that you said you wanted to build with me.

31:08.577 --> 31:09.434
It won't happen again.

31:09.523 --> 31:10.477
You're right, it won't happen again.

31:10.558 --> 31:12.452
I want you out of the office tomorrow.

31:12.527 --> 31:13.819
You're fired.

31:14.307 --> 31:14.897
Hey, come on.

31:14.983 --> 31:16.247
No, not another word out of you, kid.

31:16.329 --> 31:18.584
Don't think you don't have anything to be sorry about.

31:31.060 --> 31:33.355
Hey, Johnny, do you know where there's a towel?

31:33.452 --> 31:35.751
I don't want this ice to melt all over you.

31:35.846 --> 31:37.691
Try under the sink.

31:37.970 --> 31:39.663
You know, Marissa...

31:39.964 --> 31:42.001
you're really making this hard.

31:42.094 --> 31:43.565
Making what hard?

31:43.952 --> 31:45.176
We're friends.

31:45.540 --> 31:47.380
Yeah, we are friends.

31:47.538 --> 31:50.287
How many of those painkillers did you take?

31:50.783 --> 31:54.911
Uh, I have to tell you something.

31:56.500 --> 31:59.007
- I can't say it.
- Say what?

32:00.399 --> 32:02.668
Don't say anything back, okay?

32:02.762 --> 32:04.477
I don't want anything.

32:04.945 --> 32:07.586
I just want you to know the truth.

32:08.972 --> 32:10.565
The truth about what?

32:10.947 --> 32:12.680
I really like you.

32:13.648 --> 32:15.830
Okay, I really like you, too.

32:16.657 --> 32:17.872
No...

32:19.192 --> 32:20.427
I mean...

32:21.936 --> 32:24.077
I like you, like you.

32:26.236 --> 32:28.338
I think I'm in love with you.

32:34.761 --> 32:37.592
So, Ryan, you're a working man now.

32:37.684 --> 32:39.051
How's the job going?

32:39.159 --> 32:43.052
Model homes, calculators, dudes in suits, I bet that's pretty exciting stuff.

32:43.150 --> 32:44.023
You'd be surprised.

32:44.144 --> 32:45.170
So would Marissa.

32:45.262 --> 32:46.586
Oh, and what's she been up to?

32:46.678 --> 32:49.561
I don't know. I'll ask her when I see her, which hopefully will be tonight.

32:49.650 --> 32:50.604
What's with all the questions?

32:50.692 --> 32:53.046
Nothing, I'm just trying to exhaust all your issues so we can get to mine.

32:53.111 --> 32:54.421
Have we covered everything?

32:57.584 --> 33:00.146
My biggest fear, stated plainly.

33:00.561 --> 33:03.567
What if Summer's being smart changes our whole dynamic?

33:03.656 --> 33:04.592
Why would it?

33:04.682 --> 33:07.940
Because my intelligence was the one quality she admired in me.

33:08.021 --> 33:09.945
It made me almost a man in her eyes.

33:10.036 --> 33:11.648
Come on, man. That's not true.

33:11.733 --> 33:14.014
You've got plenty of other positive qualities.

33:14.115 --> 33:16.450
You're uh, you're...

33:17.405 --> 33:19.142
you're funny when you want to be.

33:19.229 --> 33:21.274
Have you noticed how Summer's gotten a lot funnier lately?

33:21.346 --> 33:23.137
I mean, I think she's funnier than me now.

33:23.239 --> 33:26.128
You're an expert in comic books and Yakuza films.

33:27.860 --> 33:29.084
Girls don't like that.

33:29.197 --> 33:30.641
You know how to work a grill.

33:30.741 --> 33:31.947
I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry.

33:32.046 --> 33:36.405
I thought I would come up with more, but the point is, Summer doesn't want to be you.

33:36.486 --> 33:37.734
She wants to be with you.

33:37.840 --> 33:38.921
Right?

33:39.355 --> 33:40.890
You want that, too. So...

33:40.985 --> 33:43.059
- Apologize, I know.
- Yeah.

33:43.327 --> 33:45.564
- Where you going?
- I've got to go to Sandy's office.

33:45.649 --> 33:47.597
I've got some apologizing to do myself.

33:47.683 --> 33:48.875
Give me a ride?

33:50.163 --> 33:51.824
Why don't we have cars?

33:55.482 --> 33:57.160
Don't answer it.

33:57.251 --> 33:59.357
Johnny's going to think I'm mad at him.

33:59.818 --> 34:02.222
Maybe that's not such a bad thing.

34:03.421 --> 34:06.642
Look, he was in pain. He took a bunch of pills.

34:06.748 --> 34:08.855
He probably doesn't even remember.

34:10.123 --> 34:11.478
It's not a big deal.

34:11.560 --> 34:15.315
Yeah, well, a Vicodin love confession is still a love confession.

34:15.909 --> 34:17.775
I'm sure he didn't mean it.

34:18.166 --> 34:19.813
I'm sure he did.

34:20.004 --> 34:21.411
Why?

34:21.884 --> 34:26.766
Because he told me the night that I picked you up from his place.

34:28.592 --> 34:30.379
Why didn't you say anything?

34:30.482 --> 34:32.476
He made me promise not to.

34:32.561 --> 34:35.614
He said he wasn't going to do anything so he didn't want you to know.

34:36.266 --> 34:37.728
Now I know.

34:38.963 --> 34:40.538
What am I going to do?

34:40.688 --> 34:42.172
Pretend you don't.

34:42.715 --> 34:45.428
Maybe you should just stay away from him for a while.

34:49.724 --> 34:51.313
I've got to call Ryan.

34:51.422 --> 34:52.817
Are you going to tell him?

34:57.201 --> 34:59.127
These guys won't return my calls.

34:59.230 --> 35:01.699
I can't even get a response, much less schedule another meeting.

35:01.800 --> 35:02.997
Look, I am sorry.

35:03.092 --> 35:04.955
Matt said he had it covered, and I guess I believed him.

35:05.060 --> 35:05.847
So did I.

35:05.951 --> 35:08.042
You know, it makes no sense for him to blow this off.

35:08.147 --> 35:09.861
He's the one who set up the meeting.

35:09.947 --> 35:11.464
His girlfriend dumped him.

35:11.658 --> 35:13.152
Why, 'cause he went to the strip club?

35:13.241 --> 35:14.501
Because he took the job.

35:14.600 --> 35:15.627
I guess it hit him pretty hard.

35:15.721 --> 35:17.476
Oh, you're breaking my heart. He should have said something.

35:17.562 --> 35:21.584
Because he didn't want anyone to know, especially his boss.

35:21.792 --> 35:23.492
Sorry for the drop by.

35:23.592 --> 35:25.221
Wow, Matt must be some tipper.

35:25.303 --> 35:28.205
Matt and I are friends from college.

35:30.193 --> 35:31.691
Yes, I went to college.

35:31.789 --> 35:33.530
I'm dancing to pay for law school.

35:33.616 --> 35:35.107
But I don't dance for Matt.

35:35.191 --> 35:36.582
Mostly we talk.

35:36.676 --> 35:37.586
About what?

35:37.668 --> 35:41.211
Matt's been under a lot of pressure and not just work stuff.

35:41.300 --> 35:44.672
I think he just kind of crashed and burned.

35:44.764 --> 35:46.263
Well, he couldn't have chosen a worse time.

35:46.342 --> 35:50.846
I know, and maybe none of this makes any difference, but Matt is a good guy.

35:50.948 --> 35:54.198
And this job means the world to him.

35:57.422 --> 36:02.443
What if I told you I was the one that put Matt in touch with those investors?

36:02.540 --> 36:05.181
And that I could get you another meeting.

36:05.475 --> 36:07.315
Is one your professor?

36:07.403 --> 36:09.564
No, a customer.

36:12.984 --> 36:15.899
Dad, Gloria, I'm heading over to Seth's.

36:17.779 --> 36:18.822
Hi, Seth.

36:18.922 --> 36:22.117
Hey, I just came over to apologize.

36:22.969 --> 36:24.148
Me, too.

36:24.230 --> 36:25.540
Well, no, I mean...

36:25.989 --> 36:27.246
I'm listening.

36:27.606 --> 36:28.303
Okay.

36:31.090 --> 36:34.162
Look, I'm sorry I've been such an ass, okay?

36:34.307 --> 36:37.165
It's just you're so superior to me in so many ways, you know?

36:37.243 --> 36:41.257
You're better looking, you're more popular, you're stronger,

36:41.348 --> 36:43.553
and not just emotionally.

36:44.131 --> 36:45.246
Cohen.

36:46.047 --> 36:48.005
I'll always look up to you.

36:48.914 --> 36:51.304
And not just because you're taller than me.

36:51.413 --> 36:52.898
I am taller than you.

36:56.362 --> 36:59.554
You know, that guy from Brown, he didn't say that they couldn't take

36:59.637 --> 37:01.491
more than one student from Harbor.

37:01.582 --> 37:02.788
Hey, well, this might be the year.

37:02.875 --> 37:04.105
That's right.

37:05.066 --> 37:08.841
Don't bother to try and make me feel worse than I already do. It's impossible.

37:09.696 --> 37:11.316
You knew you didn't do the work.

37:11.407 --> 37:12.898
You knew you'd get caught.

37:13.008 --> 37:14.588
You knew how I'd react.

37:14.732 --> 37:16.090
You must have wanted to get fired.

37:16.173 --> 37:19.607
Right, since I'd have absolutely nothing else going for me.

37:21.657 --> 37:24.150
The next time you have a problem, say something.

37:24.240 --> 37:25.591
You need help?

37:26.096 --> 37:27.609
Ask for it.

37:30.187 --> 37:31.612
I'll remember that.

37:41.821 --> 37:44.009
Be here at 8:00 a.m. on Monday.

37:44.938 --> 37:46.549
We'll give it another try.

37:47.360 --> 37:48.242
You'd do that?

37:48.328 --> 37:49.237
Yeah.

37:49.351 --> 37:51.737
This is your last chance. Don't screw it up.

37:51.840 --> 37:53.438
You owe me big time.

37:59.249 --> 38:00.491
Oh, hey, Julie.

38:00.661 --> 38:01.868
How was your date?

38:01.950 --> 38:03.782
Oh, it was awful.

38:04.138 --> 38:05.420
We totally didn't click.

38:05.507 --> 38:08.400
We had nothing to talk about, and his tongue was like sandpaper.

38:08.524 --> 38:10.066
Sorry to hear that.

38:10.648 --> 38:14.100
I'm sorry, I should never have stayed. It was so unprofessional of me.

38:14.158 --> 38:15.882
You made all that food for nothing.

38:15.958 --> 38:18.739
Well, it wasn't for nothing. We got paid.

38:18.841 --> 38:20.719
In a way our first venture was a success.

38:20.813 --> 38:22.469
Yeah, I guess so.

38:22.567 --> 38:24.895
How weird is it that a guy would spent that much money

38:24.984 --> 38:27.306
just to have dinner with a woman?

38:29.748 --> 38:33.087
Julie, I have an idea for a new business.

38:34.005 --> 38:35.601
Oh, my God.

38:35.737 --> 38:38.446
High-class call girl operation. I love it.

38:38.535 --> 38:39.107
No!

38:39.202 --> 38:41.537
A high-end dating service.

38:42.113 --> 38:43.718
Oh.

38:44.042 --> 38:45.842
That could work, too.

38:54.512 --> 38:57.495
Hey, Johnny. What are you doing here?

38:57.590 --> 38:59.435
I'm sorry, you're on your way out.

39:01.895 --> 39:03.321
I won't be long. I...

39:05.061 --> 39:08.106
God, you must think I'm some kind of stalker, just showing up here like this.

39:08.186 --> 39:09.612
All my calls went to voice mail, so...

39:09.702 --> 39:13.104
Johnny, look, you don't have to explain yourself.

39:13.196 --> 39:15.186
You know, we can just act like it didn't happen.

39:15.290 --> 39:17.615
Those pills will really mess with your head.

39:17.711 --> 39:19.407
Believe me, I should know.

39:19.516 --> 39:24.745
Look, Marissa, um, I didn't mean to say those things.

39:25.422 --> 39:27.176
But I did mean them.

39:28.984 --> 39:30.704
I just don't want things to get weird between us.

39:30.786 --> 39:33.437
Oh, I think things already are a little weird between us.

39:33.527 --> 39:35.007
Well, we could still be friends, right?

39:35.104 --> 39:36.350
Of course.

39:37.327 --> 39:38.663
I just...

39:39.305 --> 39:42.104
I think maybe we need to spend some time apart.

39:47.686 --> 39:48.643
Okay.

40:40.945 --> 40:45.944
Okay, if you get in and I don't, you have to go, okay?

40:46.028 --> 40:47.279
Because this is your dream.

40:47.360 --> 40:49.214
And if you get in and I don't, same thing.

40:49.292 --> 40:50.923
It's your dream now, too.

40:52.743 --> 40:56.181
Whomever gets in, I still love you.

40:56.362 --> 40:57.916
And I still love you.

41:14.773 --> 41:19.106
Actually it's whoever gets in. Not whomever. Because...

41:19.296 --> 41:22.441
you see, "who" is a...

41:26.786 --> 41:27.867
Hello?

41:27.950 --> 41:29.174
Hi.

41:29.561 --> 41:31.778
Hey, I was just calling you.

41:32.334 --> 41:33.486
Where are you?

41:33.686 --> 41:34.856
Summer's room.

41:34.939 --> 41:36.041
No one's here.

41:36.140 --> 41:38.344
You should have told me you were coming over.

41:38.535 --> 41:40.568
Then it wouldn't have been a surprise.

41:40.659 --> 41:43.410
Yeah, but then I wouldn't be sitting here in the pool house.

41:43.522 --> 41:44.701
Right.

41:45.267 --> 41:46.706
You want me to come over there?

41:47.219 --> 41:50.811
No, no, just talk to me.

41:51.797 --> 41:53.034
Okay.

42:01.246 --> 42:02.106
Hi.

42:02.457 --> 42:03.461
Hi.

42:05.732 --> 42:07.324
How was your weekend?

42:07.685 --> 42:09.211
It was pretty strange.

42:09.411 --> 42:11.040
I bet mine was stranger.

42:11.142 --> 42:12.919
I doubt it, but you go ahead.

42:13.022 --> 42:17.696
Okay, well, I mean, there's no reason to be upset.

42:17.780 --> 42:19.774
I'm the one that got a lap dance.

42:19.999 --> 42:21.543
You got a lap dance?

42:21.625 --> 42:23.204
Well, maybe you should go first.

42:23.284 --> 42:26.627
No, no, I interrupted you. Please... please continue.

42:28.115 --> 42:33.160
Um, okay, well, there's something I want to tell you about Johnny.

42:35.131 --> 42:36.135
Ryan?

42:36.391 --> 42:37.506
I'm listening.

42:38.012 --> 42:41.459
Well, the other night when you were supposed to come over...

42:42.241 --> 42:44.032
I fell asleep at Johnny's.

42:44.116 --> 42:45.610
Nothing happened.

42:45.918 --> 42:49.257
We were just really tired.

42:49.525 --> 42:51.688
But then the next night...
