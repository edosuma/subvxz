WEBVTT

02:08.045 --> 02:11.378
Pumpkin double cream cheese.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.797
Come on. You gotta eat something.

02:14.885 --> 02:17.592
Eat one of those, and then you don't
have to eat the rest of the day.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.419
Or the rest of week.

02:19.431 --> 02:23.344
Any luck, our girl Kat will
show up at the Stansbury funeral.

02:23.352 --> 02:25.843
You need some energy.
We might have to chase her down.

02:25.896 --> 02:27.261
Never know.

02:27.314 --> 02:28.895
Holder,

02:29.816 --> 02:32.899
I can't find the second shell casing.
I've looked everywhere.

02:32.903 --> 02:35.940
- You put them both on the table, right?
- Yeah.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.485
It's gotta be in the house.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.532
You looked, right?

02:41.578 --> 02:43.284
Everywhere.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.700
What about the gun?

02:45.791 --> 02:48.248
I got rid of it, like you
told me to. I'm not stupid.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.871
So it's there. Don't worry about it.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.335
- Come on. Eat something.
- What about LoJack?

02:52.422 --> 02:55.164
Someone could find his car in that
lake because we didn't check his LoJack.

02:55.258 --> 02:56.919
Idid.

02:57.636 --> 03:00.719
It didn't.
He had it disabled.

03:01.223 --> 03:04.681
The last thing he wanted was for
someone to be able to track him.

03:05.185 --> 03:08.222
How could I not have known who he was?

03:10.190 --> 03:13.273
I don't know ifI can do this.
I'm drowning, Holder.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.735
You have to.

03:18.532 --> 03:21.148
- We got no choice.
- Yeah. We do.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.535
Icould, um,

03:22.577 --> 03:26.240
just tell them who he was. What he was.

03:26.331 --> 03:27.787
Are you fucking crazy?

03:27.874 --> 03:29.330
After everything we've gone through?

03:29.334 --> 03:32.417
Look, I'm not going to
jail for that scumbag.

03:39.845 --> 03:41.881
Caroline's pregnant.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.674
Everything is different now.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.516
I'm gonna be a dad.

03:52.649 --> 03:55.482
Gonna have a wife and baby that need me.

04:00.282 --> 04:02.819
So here's what we're gonna do, Linden.

04:03.744 --> 04:07.862
We're gonna move forward
and leave this shit behind.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.915
So eat your fucking muffin.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.618
We got a funeral to get to.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.352
Right, left.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.278
Right, left.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.401
Right, left.

04:45.869 --> 04:47.655
Left, right.

04:47.746 --> 04:49.611
Left, right.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.368
What makes you think Kat will show?

04:52.459 --> 04:54.791
She was at the hospital.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.750
Maybe she's his shorty.

05:00.550 --> 05:01.926
Then again, probably not.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.625
That kid's never got his cherry popped.

05:03.720 --> 05:07.554
Left, right. Hold.

05:09.518 --> 05:12.180
Come here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

05:12.521 --> 05:15.479
Left round.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.529
Lower.

05:31.039 --> 05:32.279
About face.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.947
Kyle.

05:39.798 --> 05:41.083
What do you want?

05:41.174 --> 05:43.790
Sorry, Kyle, but we're
still looking for this girl.

05:43.844 --> 05:47.211
Well, she's not here, okay?
I told you. I don't know her.

05:47.222 --> 05:49.304
What the fuck?

05:49.474 --> 05:52.307
Why are you wasting
your time with that girl

05:52.352 --> 05:55.435
instead of catching who
did this to my family?

05:55.438 --> 05:58.771
This is absolutely not the time.
Please give Kyle some privacy.

05:58.817 --> 06:00.523
Please.

06:06.157 --> 06:09.069
Told you that girl wouldn't be here.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.572
ReaHy?

06:16.459 --> 06:18.120
He's a weak-willed son of a bitch.

06:18.128 --> 06:20.210
And I could give a shit
where he is right now.

06:20.255 --> 06:22.416
Yeah. Yeah. I hear you.

06:22.424 --> 06:24.210
Ijust wanna know where
your husband went that night

06:24.217 --> 06:26.424
- and I'll be out of your hair.
- For God's sake, Carl.

06:26.428 --> 06:29.511
Don't you people ever
talk to each other?

06:29.681 --> 06:33.094
I told that other detective that night
that he was going to the lake house.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.557
What lake house?

06:34.603 --> 06:38.596
The crappy cabin we bought up at
Lake Sawyer when we first got married.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.934
Didn't even have a toilet.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.188
We were young then and stupid.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.193
Which detective did you talk to?

06:46.197 --> 06:50.861
I don't know. The greasy
one with the chin hair.

06:51.036 --> 06:53.778
He came to the house looking for James.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.868
- Thanks, Jen.
- Okay.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.836
You've reached the voice
mail of Lieutenant Skinner.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.421
Uh, Lieutenant.

07:12.515 --> 07:13.504
Reddick here.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.637
Uh, sir, I know you're on vacation,

07:16.686 --> 07:19.268
but, uh, if you could give me a
call, it'd be mucho appreciated.

07:19.314 --> 07:23.853
Uh, not an emergency, but your
daughter's a little worried.

07:23.902 --> 07:26.814
Might wanna give her a call too.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.945
Uh, okay.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.995
This is Detective Holder.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.125
Leave a message, I'll get back to you.

07:48.259 --> 07:52.844
There is comfort in remembering
that death is not the end.

07:53.139 --> 07:57.007
There is comfort in knowing that
we can see those we love again.

07:57.435 --> 08:02.930
And that Philip, Linda,
Phoebe and Nadine

08:05.318 --> 08:07.525
have finally come home.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.190
Would you like to say a few words, son?

08:26.172 --> 08:28.424
My family was, um,

08:29.009 --> 08:31.546
a big part of my life.

08:32.637 --> 08:37.677
My little sister, Nadine, was funny, and

08:38.018 --> 08:39.849
and sweet and, uh...

08:46.026 --> 08:48.733
I guess some people think I did it.

08:57.954 --> 09:00.195
Thank you, Kyle.

09:06.588 --> 09:09.421
Would you please join me in prayer.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.711
Our Father who art in heaven,

09:16.723 --> 09:18.930
hallowed be thy name,

09:19.017 --> 09:21.008
thy kingdom come,

09:21.019 --> 09:24.728
thy will be done on
Earth as it is in heaven.

09:24.773 --> 09:29.358
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses.

09:54.385 --> 09:56.467
I shouldn't have said that.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.921
I should've written something to say.

10:04.187 --> 10:07.930
People think they know what grief is,
but

10:08.024 --> 10:09.639
they don't.

10:11.820 --> 10:15.233
You say things and do things sometimes

10:15.323 --> 10:17.564
that don't make sense.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.070
You did fine, Kyle.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.023
Cadet Knopf, you needed to see me?

11:35.069 --> 11:36.900
Yes, ma'am.

11:37.822 --> 11:41.030
- May I speak freely, ma'am?
- Of course.

11:43.161 --> 11:45.117
What is it, Knopf?

11:45.413 --> 11:47.870
This is difficult because I know
it's been a very challenging day

11:47.957 --> 11:48.946
for Cadet Stansbury.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.665
If this is a private discussion,
you may close my office door.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.542
But rules are rules.

11:53.630 --> 11:56.793
And as duty guard, I'm aware
that, as you always say, ma'am,

11:56.799 --> 11:59.006
"Good order is the
foundation of all good."

11:59.010 --> 12:02.343
What do you want, Lincoln?

12:02.597 --> 12:05.555
Last night, while I was on
patrol at around 2200 hours

12:05.558 --> 12:09.426
I witnessed a young woman sneaking
out of Cadet Stansbury's room, ma'am.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.306
How old was she?

12:11.314 --> 12:13.179
I'd say 25-ish.

12:14.025 --> 12:15.435
Who is she?

12:15.526 --> 12:17.562
I have no idea, ma'am.

12:18.321 --> 12:21.108
But I did hear what
she had to say to him.

12:24.494 --> 12:26.234
See this car here?

12:26.329 --> 12:27.785
Here it is again.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.741
Yeah. Looks like a Toyota.

12:30.166 --> 12:33.249
It's a Corolla maybe.
It's an older model though.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.705
These photos were taken
over a two-year period.

12:35.713 --> 12:38.375
This car was parked in front
of the Stansburys' house

12:38.424 --> 12:39.925
early morning, late at night.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.463
Here, there's somebody
in the driver's seat.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.545
I wanna know who this car belongs to.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.300
Sarah, it's the needle in a haystack.

12:47.308 --> 12:50.095
I mean, we got a make, maybe.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.681
This isn't much of a license plate.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.516
This doesn't give us a lot to work with.

12:54.524 --> 12:57.937
So canvass the neighborhood.
See if anyone can ID it.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.188
- Just do it.
- Detective Linden.

13:01.155 --> 13:02.611
Thanks, Harjo.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.871
Is there something I could
help you with, Colonel Rayne?

13:12.792 --> 13:14.657
Looks like you just moved in.

13:15.253 --> 13:16.663
Been a few years, actually.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.578
Decor is not our first priority.

13:18.673 --> 13:20.334
Evidently.

13:20.425 --> 13:22.165
How many of you are there?

13:22.218 --> 13:24.300
- Homicide detectives?
- Women.

13:24.512 --> 13:26.423
You're looking at her.

13:26.889 --> 13:30.427
There are advantages to being
the only woman, aren't there?

13:30.518 --> 13:33.305
I don't know. I've never
worked with another woman.

13:33.354 --> 13:36.061
We can be challenging.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.060
Or so I've been told.

13:41.904 --> 13:44.520
Yeah. How can I help you, Colonel?

13:46.743 --> 13:50.861
I think I may know where you can find
that girl that you're looking for.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.824
Kat something or other?

13:52.874 --> 13:54.284
Did Kyle say something about her?

13:54.292 --> 13:58.205
No, but she apparently
was in his room last night.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.336
That's strictly against school rules.

14:00.381 --> 14:03.544
And Kyle knows that.
I'm disappointed in him.

14:04.761 --> 14:07.002
I am doing everything that
I can to help you, Detective.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.719
As I told you that I would.

14:09.724 --> 14:11.134
Did you see the girl?

14:11.142 --> 14:12.848
One of my boys did.

14:13.102 --> 14:16.185
He heard her invite
Kyle to her show tonight.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.646
She's some kind of musician.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.780
Yo, Holder.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.028
- You got a sec?
- Yeah, but talk fast.

14:30.036 --> 14:33.278
I gotta pick something up for Caroline,
and the store closes in, like, five.

14:33.331 --> 14:37.244
Look at you. All
pussy-whipped, settled down.

14:38.002 --> 14:40.618
- Keeps me off the streets.
- We'll see how long that lasts.

14:40.671 --> 14:42.798
I know you told me, but
I can't seem to remember.

14:42.799 --> 14:48.214
What did you say you were doing that
night that Adrian kid went missing?

14:48.930 --> 14:51.637
Same as you. I was looking for the kid.

14:51.641 --> 14:52.300
Yeah.

14:52.350 --> 14:55.387
You didn't tell me you were at
the Skinner's lake house, did you?

14:55.728 --> 14:58.140
What lake house? Why would I do that?

14:58.564 --> 15:00.100
Yeah, right.

15:00.483 --> 15:02.895
Having a senior moment, I guess.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.894
What's with all the questions, man? You
wanna put me in the box or something?

15:05.905 --> 15:07.566
Just dotting my T's, crossing my I's.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.905
Pulling all this Pied Piper
shit together for the DA.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.365
Yeah, you worry me, bro.

15:11.369 --> 15:14.031
Seem a little scattered.

15:14.455 --> 15:18.619
Maybe you ought to try some of
that ginkgo biloba or something.

15:32.557 --> 15:34.843
We got a lead on the girl.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.902
ESD said Kat's last place of employment

15:52.952 --> 15:55.034
was Greenhurst Equestrian Center.

15:55.037 --> 15:57.289
The Stansburys were members.

15:57.373 --> 15:59.739
Maybe the dad gave her a job.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.995
Why would he do that?

16:02.795 --> 16:05.411
He liked her torn fishnets.

16:06.591 --> 16:08.832
Tell you one thing, Kat
can't be much of a musician

16:08.885 --> 16:10.841
if she plays at a joint like that.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.759
What is that?

16:15.808 --> 16:18.345
Chipotle cheese kale chips.

16:20.771 --> 16:23.638
You're gonna feed that
kind of crap to your baby?

16:24.317 --> 16:26.023
Maybe.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.067
When he has teeth.

16:28.154 --> 16:31.271
He? What makes you think it's a he?

16:32.325 --> 16:35.032
I don't know. I guess I always figured

16:35.161 --> 16:37.197
I'd have a little man, you know.

16:37.455 --> 16:41.824
So you're just going for
it, this whole baby thing?

16:41.959 --> 16:46.077
I'm going to my first
pre-natal ob-gyn thing tomorrow.

16:47.173 --> 16:49.710
Ijust never saw you
as the parental type.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.085
What can I say, Linden?

16:51.177 --> 16:53.759
You've been an inspiration to me.

16:57.308 --> 16:59.469
You'll be a good dad.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.307
What did Reddick want earlier?

17:03.898 --> 17:07.390
Nothing. Just talking
shit about you per usual.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.365
That's her, right?

17:18.037 --> 17:19.493
Yep.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.208
Whoa, there, kitty, kitty, kitty.

17:26.212 --> 17:29.204
- Where you going? You just got here.
- Hey. What are you doing?

17:30.216 --> 17:32.047
Seattle Police.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.712
You got a minute?

17:33.761 --> 17:35.672
Let's go, kitty.

17:37.473 --> 17:40.465
You were arrested for assaulting
Philip Stansbury last October.

17:40.476 --> 17:43.388
- He dropped the charges.
- He gave you a job.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.888
- Was he your sugar daddy?
- It wasn't like that.

17:46.941 --> 17:49.728
I needed the money and
a place to stay, so...

17:49.777 --> 17:52.519
That beach house, you were living there?

17:52.947 --> 17:54.653
I don't buy it, mamacita.

17:54.699 --> 17:57.657
Why would he move a sneaky little
ho-bag thief into his beach house

17:57.702 --> 18:00.034
unless he was getting a little
something-something on the side?

18:00.037 --> 18:01.902
How the hell should I know?

18:02.790 --> 18:05.372
Guess he was just a nice guy.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.491
- Can I go now?
- Was he?

18:08.004 --> 18:09.790
A nice guy?

18:10.673 --> 18:12.038
Ask his kid.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.547
We're asking you.

18:19.390 --> 18:21.176
He was okay.

18:21.267 --> 18:25.306
He got me a job shoveling horse
shit at that phony club of his,

18:25.313 --> 18:28.020
so I guess I should
be eternally grateful.

18:28.024 --> 18:30.640
Seems you had a pretty good
deal at the Stansbury's.

18:30.651 --> 18:31.891
Why'd you leave?

18:31.902 --> 18:33.938
Because the social experiment was over.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.486
And he had failed.

18:35.531 --> 18:37.032
Who?

18:37.700 --> 18:43.366
Philip Stansbury, a.k.a.
Father of the Year 2013,

18:43.414 --> 18:46.827
failed to rehabilitate
poor little fucked-up me.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.454
That was his mantra.

18:49.503 --> 18:53.997
Hard work and discipline will
lead to strength in character.

18:54.091 --> 18:56.298
Apparently, a shit-ton of money.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.250
- You seen that house?
- You did.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.841
We've got your prints all over it.

19:00.890 --> 19:04.053
I used to sneak in when
they weren't around.

19:04.352 --> 19:08.937
Walk, pretend I lived in those
rooms, like that was my life.

19:08.939 --> 19:10.224
But it wasn't.

19:10.274 --> 19:13.016
I was just an example to his loser son

19:13.069 --> 19:17.312
that following the rules could
make you a stand-up citizen.

19:17.323 --> 19:19.359
Do your chores. Clean your room.

19:19.367 --> 19:20.527
No blue jeans.

19:20.576 --> 19:22.692
No posters on the walls.

19:22.703 --> 19:24.910
No snacking between meals.

19:24.955 --> 19:27.116
What rules did you break?

19:27.875 --> 19:31.163
Took a fucking
Haagen-Dazs bar out of the freezer

19:31.212 --> 19:33.043
because I was hungry.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.465
He practically called the cops.

19:39.053 --> 19:42.671
When Kyle tried to stand up for
me, he punched Kyle in the face.

19:45.643 --> 19:47.599
His own kid.

19:54.652 --> 19:58.236
So you had plenty of motive
to kill Philip Stansbury.

19:59.615 --> 20:02.607
A lot of people hated the Stansburys.

20:02.618 --> 20:05.109
They were mean, hateful people.

20:05.121 --> 20:09.581
Their stuck-up daughter was cruel.
The mom was sick, I mean real sick.

20:09.625 --> 20:14.039
Used to walk around the house braless,
flirting with Phoebe's boyfriends.

20:14.839 --> 20:18.832
I heard rumors she used to teach
tennis to the boys at the high school

20:18.843 --> 20:21.175
and then something happened.

20:22.722 --> 20:23.928
Poor Kyle.

20:23.931 --> 20:28.300
The only thing he ever did was
try to protect me from his dad.

20:28.894 --> 20:31.556
I was the only friend he had.

20:33.190 --> 20:35.226
That motherfucker being dead

20:35.234 --> 20:38.567
is the best thing that
ever happened to Kyle.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.277
Trust me.

20:43.033 --> 20:44.284
You were there that night.

20:44.326 --> 20:46.863
The lights were on in the beach house.

20:49.081 --> 20:52.790
Kyle gave me the key, okay? It was
a place to stay when I needed one.

20:52.793 --> 20:54.454
That night?

20:59.467 --> 21:01.753
Fell asleep watching TV.

21:02.928 --> 21:06.386
I heard this noise...

21:07.725 --> 21:09.590
like a scream.

21:10.019 --> 21:11.930
Freaked me out.

21:11.937 --> 21:14.314
I was going over to the house...

21:15.107 --> 21:17.348
and then I heard gunshots.

21:18.903 --> 21:21.485
Lots and lots of gunshots.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.856
I got scared and ran.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.365
Can I please go now?

21:27.411 --> 21:31.199
Afraid not. We're gonna need your
company for the next 48 hours.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.120
Then I want a lawyer.

21:51.727 --> 21:54.013
Dead center's 10 points.

21:54.021 --> 21:56.103
If any of the dot
remains, it counts as nine.

22:06.283 --> 22:08.444
Shooting's a very mental sport.

22:08.828 --> 22:12.195
If you're not prepared
up here, can't do it.

22:12.915 --> 22:14.496
Meyers says he thinks
I got a good chance

22:14.500 --> 22:16.912
at qualifying for Junior Olympics.

22:18.003 --> 22:19.868
If Rayne will let me.

22:20.089 --> 22:22.330
That bitch wants to do
away with the rifle club.

22:23.759 --> 22:26.375
My dad will have something
to say about that.

22:26.387 --> 22:27.627
I thought you liked her.

22:27.638 --> 22:29.424
It's not about liking.

22:29.431 --> 22:31.012
It's about what she's
done to St. George's.

22:31.016 --> 22:34.133
You know, graduating from this
place used to mean something.

22:36.647 --> 22:38.729
The whole place has gone to shit.

22:39.567 --> 22:42.183
Now they'll let anyone
in who has the dough.

22:43.028 --> 22:46.862
Well, Colonel Rayne seems to
really care about the school.

22:46.907 --> 22:48.192
No shit she does.

22:48.242 --> 22:50.483
It's the only job she could get
after she bombed out of the Army.

22:50.536 --> 22:52.948
I heard she was dishonorably discharged.

22:53.289 --> 22:55.075
You heard from whom?

22:55.165 --> 22:57.121
My dad knows a lot of people.

22:58.002 --> 22:59.367
You want a shot?

22:59.628 --> 23:01.414
Heh. No, that's okay.

23:01.463 --> 23:04.079
I'm not very good.

23:04.174 --> 23:06.711
You're probably better
than you think you are.

23:12.850 --> 23:14.010
Uh-oh.

23:14.018 --> 23:16.225
Here comes Ginger.

23:29.325 --> 23:31.236
Get out of the car.

23:40.669 --> 23:42.079
Get out. Now.

23:44.757 --> 23:46.713
I'm through with your bullshit.
This isn't a game.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.624
Get out.

23:54.725 --> 23:56.556
- Stop. Stop.
- This is where it started.

23:56.602 --> 23:58.138
Your parents were asleep.

23:58.187 --> 24:00.098
The killer was cold-blooded,

24:00.105 --> 24:01.185
- Please stop.
- methodical.

24:01.190 --> 24:02.600
- Just stop.
- First your dad.

24:02.650 --> 24:03.765
He never had a chance.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.267
Shot in the chest three
times while he was sleeping.

24:06.362 --> 24:07.818
Blew a hole right through his head.

24:07.821 --> 24:09.777
Why are you doing this to me?

24:09.782 --> 24:11.192
- And then your mom.
- No.

24:11.241 --> 24:13.823
She was wounded, but
she tried to crawl away.

24:13.869 --> 24:15.405
- Shot three times in the back.
- Stop.

24:15.454 --> 24:16.955
Once in the back of the head.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.321
- Was she screaming?
- Stop it.

24:18.332 --> 24:20.994
- Did she call out for you, Kyle?
- I don't know. I don't know.

24:21.001 --> 24:22.161
I don't remember.

24:22.169 --> 24:25.002
- Was Kat here? Was she with you?
- I... I...

24:25.005 --> 24:26.120
She was your only friend.

24:26.173 --> 24:29.131
She said your father being dead was the
best thing that ever happened to you.

24:29.134 --> 24:31.625
- I don't know why she said that, I swear.
- Are you protecting her?

24:31.637 --> 24:33.719
- Leave me alone.
- Did she do this?

24:33.764 --> 24:35.345
Did she do this to make
life better for you?

24:35.391 --> 24:37.757
- No. No.
- Did she help you do it?

24:37.810 --> 24:40.142
No. No. She didn't help me do it.

24:40.187 --> 24:42.348
You lied about knowing Kat.

24:42.356 --> 24:44.267
What else did you lie about?

24:44.566 --> 24:45.942
Did you pull the trigger?

24:45.943 --> 24:48.400
Stop it. I'm gonna be sick.

25:02.543 --> 25:05.535
Come on. We're not done.

25:07.881 --> 25:11.044
Don't. Not anymore. Please.

25:12.886 --> 25:15.548
That is where we found Nadine.

25:19.143 --> 25:21.054
Who could kill a sweet,
innocent little girl like her?

25:21.061 --> 25:22.471
I don't know.

25:22.479 --> 25:25.812
I don't know. I would tell you ifI did.

25:26.859 --> 25:30.192
She was the only one who loved me.

25:30.195 --> 25:35.189
She was the only one who cared about
me in this whole fucking family.

25:54.428 --> 25:57.386
There was no music in this house.

25:58.307 --> 26:00.013
N0 talking.

26:00.017 --> 26:02.133
They all hated me.

26:02.186 --> 26:04.142
Why did they hate you?

26:04.563 --> 26:06.144
This...

26:06.148 --> 26:09.185
I don't know.
This was a house of silence.

26:09.234 --> 26:12.647
No one told the truth about anything.

26:16.950 --> 26:19.407
What was the truth, Kyle?

26:19.411 --> 26:21.072
I don't know.

26:26.877 --> 26:28.913
Did I kill them?

26:29.379 --> 26:31.756
Maybe I did.

26:32.132 --> 26:35.590
You loved Nadine. Do you really
think you could've killed her?

26:39.765 --> 26:41.175
No.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.516
Never.

27:20.305 --> 27:23.217
From the moment I was born, that's
all my dad ever wanted.

27:23.267 --> 27:26.759
- What?
- For me to be a good soldier.

27:27.354 --> 27:30.312
- You collect those?
- No.

27:30.607 --> 27:32.893
My dad gave me one every
year for my birthday.

27:32.943 --> 27:35.355
But I wasn't allowed to touch them.

27:36.363 --> 27:37.944
They're rare.

27:38.782 --> 27:41.239
Kat mentioned something about
an incident

27:41.285 --> 27:43.571
at the high school with your mom.

27:43.829 --> 27:46.036
You know what she was talking about?

28:11.273 --> 28:12.888
You sure?

28:13.358 --> 28:15.815
The girl's prints don't
match the partial?

28:15.819 --> 28:17.525
Partial on the gun?

28:17.529 --> 28:20.111
All right. Well, just run it again.

28:21.033 --> 28:22.239
Just do it, all right?

28:22.242 --> 28:24.278
Call me back when it's done.

28:26.955 --> 28:28.695
I must've messed up the time.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.698
Sorry, babe.

28:31.084 --> 28:34.042
I got there, they said you
already left, and, you know...

28:34.129 --> 28:37.212
Well, I found out our due date.

28:37.549 --> 28:39.005
October 10th.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.591
The baby's a Libra.

28:41.678 --> 28:43.794
That's tight, right?

28:43.889 --> 28:46.380
- That's a good thing?
- I don't know.

28:46.475 --> 28:51.720
I think the Libras are diplomatic
and non-confrontational.

28:53.398 --> 28:55.184
What's going on?

28:56.109 --> 28:59.272
We're holding someone for
the Stansbury murders, but

28:59.863 --> 29:01.524
I don't think she did it.

29:01.573 --> 29:04.235
No, I meant, what's wrong?

29:04.326 --> 29:06.863
You've been kind of out of it.

29:06.954 --> 29:08.535
Nothing.

29:10.499 --> 29:12.035
You do remember that we're having dinner

29:12.125 --> 29:15.868
with your sister and her
kids tomorrow night, right?

29:15.921 --> 29:18.754
Because clearly,
you forgot the cupcakes.

29:22.844 --> 29:27.383
I'm sorry, babe. I've just been
waylaid with this case and everything.

29:29.393 --> 29:32.180
I'll pick them up tomorrow.
What's the big deal?

29:32.813 --> 29:34.769
Uh, nothing.

29:35.023 --> 29:36.809
Just don't forget the dinner.

29:36.817 --> 29:39.559
Okay? That's the big deal.

29:39.861 --> 29:41.442
Mm-hm.

31:38.188 --> 31:40.725
- Jack.
- Hey, Mom.

31:41.566 --> 31:44.308
Oh, no. It's spring break.

31:44.319 --> 31:47.026
I was supposed to pick you
up at the airport at 6:15.

31:47.030 --> 31:49.612
I tried to call you,
but you didn't answer.

31:49.616 --> 31:52.403
So I took a cab.
Figured you were working.

31:52.619 --> 31:54.405
I'm sorry.

31:55.038 --> 31:58.030
I'm sorry. I'm so glad you're here.

31:59.209 --> 32:00.995
Are you okay, Mom?

32:02.045 --> 32:04.001
Yeah, I am now.

32:04.339 --> 32:06.250
Iam now.

32:09.594 --> 32:12.301
There he was, standing at my door.

32:12.305 --> 32:15.172
I didn't even remember he was coming.

32:16.351 --> 32:17.852
Of course,
I had nothing planned for him,

32:17.936 --> 32:20.268
so I guess he'll just hang
out at the house all day.

32:20.355 --> 32:23.472
He'll be all right as
long as the Internet works.

32:23.859 --> 32:26.350
You're full of sunshine today.

32:27.821 --> 32:30.028
I've been thinking about Kat.
I don't buy her as the killer.

32:30.031 --> 32:31.407
It doesn't feel right.

32:31.408 --> 32:33.239
Ain't her palm print on the gun.

32:33.243 --> 32:34.949
We should probably cut her loose.

32:35.036 --> 32:38.699
And I don't think Kyle did it
either. Not after yesterday.

32:40.250 --> 32:42.491
Look, I've been thinking.

32:45.547 --> 32:48.630
I mean, Reddick ain't as much
of a mook as we think he is.

32:49.926 --> 32:52.633
Yesterday, he asked me what
I was doing again that night.

32:52.679 --> 32:54.294
What'd you tell him?

32:54.764 --> 32:57.176
I told him I was looking
for Adrian as before.

32:57.225 --> 32:58.886
So, what's the problem?

32:58.935 --> 33:01.426
He brought up the lake house.

33:02.105 --> 33:04.482
I mean, I played dumb,
but I don't like it.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.394
He ain't letting it go.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.938
He must have talked to Jen.

33:08.945 --> 33:11.652
You asked her about the
lake house that night.

33:13.241 --> 33:15.027
What are we gonna do?

33:16.077 --> 33:18.489
She doesn't know anything, and
Reddick doesn't have anything.

33:18.497 --> 33:20.237
He's just digging.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.706
Why didn't you tell me about this?

33:22.709 --> 33:24.620
Ijust did.

33:24.920 --> 33:26.456
We can't afford to keep secrets.

33:26.505 --> 33:29.087
Just keep your shit together, Holder.

33:34.471 --> 33:37.053
Yes, Linda Stansbury was assistant coach

33:37.057 --> 33:40.094
for our boys' varsity tennis
team a couple of years ago.

33:40.101 --> 33:42.513
She was quite a dynamo.

33:42.771 --> 33:45.888
What a tragedy. That poor family.

33:45.899 --> 33:48.265
We heard she had some
trouble when she was here.

33:48.443 --> 33:50.274
It was hearsay.

33:50.278 --> 33:52.530
And I prefer not to
speak ill of the dead.

33:52.531 --> 33:54.021
Aw.

33:54.199 --> 33:55.780
Go ahead.

33:56.159 --> 33:57.695
Was she fired?

33:57.702 --> 34:01.320
We came to an agreement that it might
be best if she wasn't here anymore.

34:01.331 --> 34:03.117
So she was fired. Why?

34:03.124 --> 34:05.661
I don't really think we need
to dredge that up right now.

34:05.710 --> 34:09.168
This is a multiple homicide
investigation, Mr. Duvergne.

34:09.381 --> 34:11.246
So you can make it easy on yourself,

34:11.258 --> 34:15.501
or we can bring you down to Homicide for
a formal conversation. It's your call.

34:17.597 --> 34:20.509
There were allegations of
inappropriate sexual relations

34:20.517 --> 34:22.007
with a 16-yea r-old
student.

34:22.018 --> 34:24.475
- Male or female?
- A boy.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.599
One of her tennis players.

34:28.024 --> 34:33.690
There were, um, suggestive texts sent,
and there were allegations of relations.

34:33.738 --> 34:36.275
- But no charges were filed?
- No.

34:36.283 --> 34:38.945
Whoa. So you had a teacher
sexually assault a minor,

34:38.952 --> 34:40.613
and you didn't file charges?

34:40.620 --> 34:43.737
His parents weren't interested
in pursuing it further.

34:43.748 --> 34:45.739
And Mrs. Stansbury left.

34:45.750 --> 34:49.538
She was a volunteer, you see.
So she was donating her time.

34:49.588 --> 34:53.172
I'm sure the Stansburys donated
more than time to your school.

34:53.216 --> 34:56.128
Explains why nobody believed
the kid or stood up for him.

34:56.177 --> 34:58.554
He was extremely troubled.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.508
Shortly after Mrs. Stansbury left,

35:00.515 --> 35:03.882
he came to school with
a weapon in his backpack.

35:04.477 --> 35:05.557
What kind of weapon?

35:05.604 --> 35:09.062
We have a strict zero-tolerance
policy at Meadow Park,

35:09.065 --> 35:11.226
so he had to leave, of course.

35:11.318 --> 35:14.651
Like I said, he was a very troubled boy.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.438
What's his name, Mr. Duvergne?

35:17.490 --> 35:20.527
I'm sorry, but I really
can't tell you that.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.701
He was a minor, that's
all I'm willing to say.

35:22.746 --> 35:25.408
I'm within my rights
not to disclose his name.

35:25.415 --> 35:29.283
Now, if you'll excuse me, I
have a meeting with my staff.

35:31.296 --> 35:34.129
What kind of weapon
did he bring to school?

35:36.760 --> 35:38.341
A handgun.

35:38.386 --> 35:41.002
With 50 rounds of ammunition.

35:44.684 --> 35:47.061
I'll call King County Sheriff's,
see if they got an arrest report

35:47.062 --> 35:50.805
of a kid with a gun at Meadow
Park the last couple of years.

35:50.899 --> 35:52.230
Hey, Sarah.

35:52.317 --> 35:54.308
Hey, I canvassed the entire
Stansbury neighborhood.

35:54.402 --> 35:57.360
There's no older model Corollas for
the residents or their employees.

35:57.447 --> 35:58.687
What about partial plates?

35:58.698 --> 36:00.859
We got three letters: W, E and Q.

36:00.909 --> 36:02.900
And over 5000 hits.

36:03.036 --> 36:04.947
- Okay. Thanks, Harjo.
- Yeah.

36:05.038 --> 36:07.279
Holder, Linden, got a second?

36:13.922 --> 36:15.412
What's up?

36:17.258 --> 36:20.045
You two know Bethany Skinner, right?

36:24.099 --> 36:26.556
I thought you'd wanna
know about the lieutenant.

36:26.559 --> 36:28.220
Yeah? What about him?

36:29.312 --> 36:30.848
He's alive and well.

36:30.855 --> 36:33.562
Clearing his head in Wyoming
for a couple of weeks.

36:34.192 --> 36:37.605
Dad texted me this morning. Finally.

36:38.571 --> 36:41.153
Sorry, I guess I overreacted.

36:44.494 --> 36:47.076
Guess we can call off the dogs, hm?

37:08.768 --> 37:10.554
What the hell's going on?

37:10.645 --> 37:13.182
Am I going fucking nuts here?

37:15.942 --> 37:18.729
You sent that text. You kept his phone?

37:18.737 --> 37:21.103
Yeah. Thank God I did. It saved us.

37:21.114 --> 37:24.322
- I got her and him off our backs.
- I thought we got rid of everything.

37:24.325 --> 37:26.782
- What else you got?
- Nothing.

37:27.287 --> 37:29.278
You didn't think to tell
me you'd keep his phone?

37:29.330 --> 37:31.946
- No, I didn't.
- Why the hell not?

37:31.958 --> 37:34.495
You were losing your shit, Holder.
I didn't know what you'd do.

37:34.502 --> 37:38.290
Me? You're the crazy one. You're the
one who can't keep your shit together.

37:38.298 --> 37:42.257
Look, just calm down.
I took care of it, okay?

37:43.553 --> 37:46.670
We don't have to worry about Bethany
or Reddick or anything anymore.

37:46.681 --> 37:48.797
We got away with it.

37:49.768 --> 37:51.884
Isn't that what you wanted?

38:34.020 --> 38:36.432
That's enough for today, cadet.

38:37.065 --> 38:39.351
Hopefully, you've learned your lesson.

38:39.442 --> 38:40.602
You're dismissed.

38:40.610 --> 38:43.317
You may return to the
barracks for the evening.

38:43.571 --> 38:47.689
Ma'am, I'd like to stay and
finish up, if that's okay, ma'am.

38:49.410 --> 38:53.369
When everyone goes home for the weekend,
it gets kind of quiet in the barracks.

38:54.207 --> 38:55.788
All right, then.

38:58.044 --> 39:02.583
Why don't you get cleaned up and
meet me at 1900 hours at my residence?

39:04.467 --> 39:06.423
I imagine you're hungry.

39:25.238 --> 39:28.401
You said in your, um...
your application to the academy

39:28.449 --> 39:32.442
that you were interested
in going east for college?

39:32.495 --> 39:34.611
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.323
You have time to figure it out.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.121
I'm graduating in three months,

39:41.170 --> 39:44.754
so I think that ship has kind
of sailed, don't you?

39:46.009 --> 39:50.628
If you could go somewhere,
anywhere, where would that be?

39:50.722 --> 39:53.429
I just wanna get out of Seattle.

39:54.058 --> 39:55.923
I hate the rain.

40:00.607 --> 40:02.768
I'm sorry I lied to you.

40:04.944 --> 40:08.107
Kat had nothing to do with it, and, um,

40:08.114 --> 40:09.820
I didn't want her to get in any trouble.

40:09.908 --> 40:13.821
She's had it tough enough as it is.

40:16.456 --> 40:18.868
I won't break the rules anymore.

40:30.678 --> 40:33.795
We can have dessert in the living room.

41:31.531 --> 41:34.443
Oh, don't stop. That was lovely.

41:35.868 --> 41:38.359
I don't remember the rest.

41:40.456 --> 41:44.574
Your father said you were very
talented, but I had no idea.

41:44.627 --> 41:46.834
I was never good enough.

41:47.046 --> 41:49.002
My dad used to take me
to all the competitions...

41:49.007 --> 41:51.589
but he said it was a waste of time.

41:54.554 --> 41:57.045
I was never very musical.

41:57.557 --> 42:00.720
But I'll tell you a secret.

42:09.068 --> 42:10.808
Idance.

42:12.030 --> 42:13.691
Ballroom dancing.

42:14.365 --> 42:15.946
ReaHy?

42:15.950 --> 42:18.066
- Really.
- Ha-ha-ha.

42:25.043 --> 42:28.877
You know, I was raised
by an exacting father,

42:29.297 --> 42:32.505
and I know what that's like.

42:33.092 --> 42:34.878
To want somebody's approval.

42:34.886 --> 42:37.673
To long for it and...

42:38.598 --> 42:40.805
to never quite get it.

42:45.855 --> 42:48.221
Kyle, did he hurt you?

42:48.858 --> 42:50.940
Did he do that to you?

42:52.653 --> 42:55.110
My dad? No.

42:56.157 --> 42:58.148
Uh, Nadine did.

42:58.242 --> 42:59.698
Your little sister?

42:59.744 --> 43:02.030
She had night terrors.

43:02.413 --> 43:05.029
She'd just be sitting
up with her eyes open,

43:05.083 --> 43:07.244
like fully open, screaming, and...

43:07.251 --> 43:09.207
But I couldn't wake her up.

43:09.212 --> 43:11.419
So I'd just hold her
as tight as I could.

43:11.422 --> 43:15.461
And she'd scratch and
bite me like a dog.

43:16.385 --> 43:19.377
And I'd just wrap my arms around her.

43:20.765 --> 43:25.054
And I could just feel her little heart
beating so fast until it was over.

43:25.728 --> 43:28.720
It was like that almost
every night, you know.

43:28.898 --> 43:32.686
But what about your parents?
They must've heard her.

43:32.735 --> 43:37.320
Yeah. It went on for hours
sometimes, but no one else ever came.

43:41.077 --> 43:43.864
She used to say there
was a monster in her room.

43:43.871 --> 43:48.661
I told her not to be afraid, you
know, that the monster had gone away.

43:59.929 --> 44:02.841
You know what you said
about grief at the cemetery.

44:02.890 --> 44:04.801
How'd you know?

44:06.352 --> 44:09.014
I lost someone, uh,

44:09.272 --> 44:12.514
very close to me once.

44:14.026 --> 44:17.644
I didn't realize at the
time how great that loss was.

44:19.407 --> 44:22.945
But I grieve it every day.

44:27.415 --> 44:33.160
Kyle, I think that it is a good thing
that you're here at St. George's.

44:34.172 --> 44:36.754
The discipline, the
camaraderie, the sense of purpose

44:36.757 --> 44:38.338
gave my life meaning again,

44:38.384 --> 44:40.921
and it can do the same for you.

44:41.846 --> 44:44.087
Well, you don't seem happy.

44:47.310 --> 44:48.925
Iam.

44:49.270 --> 44:51.261
I'm very happy.

44:58.696 --> 45:00.607
This ca ke's good.

45:42.573 --> 45:46.316
It's called a natural childbirth
because it's natural. You know?

45:46.369 --> 45:48.325
Women have been doing
it for hundreds of years.

45:48.371 --> 45:50.032
Maybe even longer.

45:51.374 --> 45:53.330
Why would we take her to a hospital?

45:53.334 --> 45:54.995
They'll just shoot her
up with a bunch of drugs.

45:55.002 --> 45:56.913
All right, little man.
You can speak Spanish.

45:57.004 --> 45:58.460
We get it. We get it.

45:58.506 --> 46:00.337
And she won't even bond with the baby.

46:00.383 --> 46:04.092
Come on. I had both of these kids in the
hospital, I bonded with them just fine.

46:04.095 --> 46:06.336
All I care about is a healthy baby.

46:06.847 --> 46:09.133
And I mean, it's safer at home.

46:09.141 --> 46:11.598
You know, birth is a sacred experience.

46:11.602 --> 46:15.015
Sage and myrrh massages
loosens the pudendum.

46:15.189 --> 46:18.932
Heh. Okay. Wow. Heh, TMI, babe.

46:22.446 --> 46:24.698
All right, little man, chill.
I'm serious.

46:25.574 --> 46:28.111
Don't you want a doctor there?
What if something goes wrong?

46:28.160 --> 46:31.368
- What could go wrong?
- A lot. Believe me.

46:31.497 --> 46:34.034
Can we not talk about this
right now? Who wants dessert?

46:34.083 --> 46:35.823
- Me.
- Me.

46:37.128 --> 46:40.245
My friend Marny's baby got stuck.

46:40.798 --> 46:43.414
Yeah, well, that ain't gonna happen.

46:43.509 --> 46:46.000
You know what your problem is, Liz?

46:46.012 --> 46:49.004
You're a downer. You always have been.

46:49.015 --> 46:52.007
That's why you can't get a date.
No one wants to be around you.

46:52.059 --> 46:54.675
All right, shut the fuck up, little man.

46:54.770 --> 46:56.226
Stephen.

46:56.230 --> 47:00.519
He can take it. His dad used to say
way worse. Ain't that right, little man?

47:00.526 --> 47:03.017
Huh? Ain't that right?

47:04.530 --> 47:07.647
- Shut the fuck up.
- You shut the fuck up.

47:07.742 --> 47:11.030
Great. Great. Thanks a lot, Uncle Steve.

47:11.078 --> 47:13.455
I'm sorry,
but your kids are running wild.

47:13.497 --> 47:15.783
They don't listen to a thing you say.

47:15.791 --> 47:17.076
Kids need boundaries.

47:17.126 --> 47:19.538
Yeah. Like you know the first
thing about being a parent.

47:19.545 --> 47:22.207
You're barely out of
adolescence yourself.

47:23.466 --> 47:24.751
I'm sorry, Caroline,

47:24.759 --> 47:29.753
but the idea of this guy being
someone's father is a little scary.

47:31.015 --> 47:35.054
I forget. If you're clean in NA, does
that mean you can still drink alcohol?

47:35.186 --> 47:36.426
Fuck you too.

47:36.479 --> 47:38.435
Sorry, kids.

47:38.522 --> 47:40.183
Stephen, come on. Please stop.

47:40.232 --> 47:43.360
He can't help himself,
Caroline. He's drunk.

47:43.444 --> 47:46.026
Whatever. Beyotch.

47:46.072 --> 47:48.563
Don't you dare talk that
way in front of my kids.

47:48.616 --> 47:52.154
He picked up a new case.
He's been under a lot of stress lately.

47:52.161 --> 47:55.653
Don't apologize for me. You
don't even fucking know me.

47:57.375 --> 47:59.036
Isn't this what you want?

47:59.043 --> 48:02.251
Your little bro getting married,
settled down. Blah, blah, blah.

48:02.254 --> 48:03.710
Well, I did it.

48:03.756 --> 48:06.839
I more than did it. We're gonna make it.

48:08.052 --> 48:10.134
I made it. Fuck, I more than made it.

48:10.137 --> 48:11.843
We're gonna be happy.

48:11.889 --> 48:14.926
Just because you've never
been happy don't mean I won't.

48:15.518 --> 48:18.009
Even though Mark was an
asshole, I don't blame him.

48:18.020 --> 48:19.476
Stephen.

48:20.815 --> 48:22.726
Kill myself too,
ifI had to live with you.

48:22.775 --> 48:24.686
Stephen, shut up.

48:25.528 --> 48:28.895
Who wants to watch cartoons?
Let's go watch cartoons.

48:34.203 --> 48:36.865
You're an awful person.

48:38.707 --> 48:40.288
Maybe.

50:39.411 --> 50:43.279
I can't tell you how many times
I drove high and loaded.

50:43.791 --> 50:45.747
Woke up to check the grill of my car

50:45.751 --> 50:49.585
to make sure there wasn't somebody's
dog or a kid crushed on it.

50:49.880 --> 50:51.745
God was in that car
with me those nights.

50:51.757 --> 50:54.669
He was behind the wheel,
not this piece of shit.

50:55.636 --> 50:58.298
And I'm grateful today
that I don't gotta apologize

50:58.347 --> 51:03.216
to some mother for killing her child,
some wife for killing her husband.

51:05.521 --> 51:07.432
That's all I got.

51:11.277 --> 51:12.813
Stephen, addict.

51:12.861 --> 51:14.317
Stephen.

51:14.405 --> 51:17.238
Good for you, man. For you.

51:17.533 --> 51:20.240
You didn't kill anyone. Good for you.

51:22.204 --> 51:24.661
God checked out on me.

51:24.748 --> 51:27.535
Blacked out in the back seat
or something.

51:28.419 --> 51:31.502
I got a body on my grill.

51:32.631 --> 51:35.668
No one knows what I
did. I got away with it.

51:36.010 --> 51:37.921
So it's all good, right?

51:41.599 --> 51:43.555
Fuck God.

51:46.395 --> 51:48.636
Fuck God.

51:48.731 --> 51:51.063
Fuck all of you.

51:54.445 --> 51:57.312
Because none of you got anything I need.

51:59.158 --> 52:02.821
But tell me what I'm supposed to do
with this shit that's on my scorecard.

52:07.082 --> 52:10.666
I'm gonna be a dad.

52:13.255 --> 52:15.541
Dad to a little baby.

52:19.303 --> 52:21.794
You think you're a piece of shit?

52:22.765 --> 52:24.926
You got no idea, man.

52:27.394 --> 52:29.225
Noidea.

53:40.634 --> 53:42.090
What you looking for, Harjo?

53:42.094 --> 53:43.800
Uh, Holder and Linden.

53:43.804 --> 53:47.137
I got the arrest record and booking
photo of that kid from the high school.

53:47.182 --> 53:49.298
The one that brought the gun to school?

53:49.309 --> 53:51.049
Just leave it. They'll be in soon.

53:51.061 --> 53:53.268
You got good hair, kid.

53:53.313 --> 53:56.271
I remember when I had hair like that.

53:58.569 --> 54:01.311
Hair is wasted on the young.
