- If it's okay with this guy.

16:47.673 --> 16:48.883
- Oh, we're not dating.

I'm just giving her
all my money

16:50.676 --> 16:52.261

Every time I think I can't be
more disappointed by you,

16:56.849 --> 16:58.517
you surprise me.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.853
- [sighs] Look, I don't want
to go back to recruiting

17:00.853 --> 17:02.188
any more than you do.

17:02.188 --> 17:04.273
This was not my vision
for the town.

17:04.273 --> 17:07.526
I did this to save your mom.
- Fine.

17:07.526 --> 17:10.029
Let's take the scenic route
to the Elders' Houses.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.530

17:11.530 --> 17:13.616
- Look, I have spent all day
trying to figure out

17:13.616 --> 17:15.284
how to make money
to save this town

17:15.284 --> 17:16.744
without taking advantage
of people,

17:16.744 --> 17:18.079
and I'm all out of ideas.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.872
- Typical city person.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.541
Can't you just take a minute
to enjoy your surroundings?

17:22.541 --> 17:23.751
Look around.

17:23.751 --> 17:26.003
T-there's a deer...

Giving birth.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.635
That there's a star--

17:32.635 --> 17:35.179
you guessed it, giving birth.

17:35.179 --> 17:38.599
- [sighs] They sure don't make
nature like this in New York.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.685
- Sometimes you just
got to clear your head

17:40.685 --> 17:43.854
and get out into nature and
connect with something real--

17:43.854 --> 17:45.481
dirt, trees.

17:45.481 --> 17:46.566
- Marble.

17:46.566 --> 17:47.942
- What?
- Look.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.821
This is where
all the money went.

17:51.821 --> 17:53.781
- It's the Elders' Houses,
of course.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.992
They designed them themselves.

17:55.992 --> 17:57.827
- Mae Mae, you neglected
to tell me

17:57.827 --> 18:00.705
that the Elders live
in giant marble palaces--

18:00.705 --> 18:03.916
and not just any marble,
Carrara marble.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.918
- I'm sure
it's not that expensive.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.545
- Don't challenge a city girl

18:07.545 --> 18:09.839
on her ability to recognize
different types of marble.

18:09.839 --> 18:11.924
I would recognize
my mom's favorite countertops

18:11.924 --> 18:13.259
from anywhere.

18:13.259 --> 18:14.719
- Well, that's very neat, dear,

18:14.719 --> 18:16.637
but let's get
this recruiting going.

18:24.061 --> 18:27.148
for his most holy
bank transfer, hmm?

18:27.148 --> 18:28.941
- No, we won't be doing that.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.901
We're not stealing
the pharmacist's money

18:30.901 --> 18:32.737
or those children's eyes
or necks,

18:32.737 --> 18:34.488
because this isn't just a scam.

18:34.488 --> 18:35.823
It's a pyramid scheme.

18:35.823 --> 18:38.117
You guys took all the money
from new recruits

18:38.117 --> 18:41.454
and used it to build
these houses made of floor.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.039
But I'm going to take
the pyramid

18:43.039 --> 18:44.749

you're new around here,

18:49.795 --> 18:50.963

18:50.963 --> 18:52.465
We get nice stuff

18:52.465 --> 18:54.967
as payment for our job
of being your dad's friends.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.260
- Well, you're not my friends,

18:56.260 --> 18:57.970
so you can just move
into one house together.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.680
You guys cool with that?

- Well, we--we will do whatever
our greater leader decrees.

19:04.185 --> 19:06.270
- So we're redistributing
the wealth--great!

19:06.270 --> 19:08.189
It might not solve
everything long-term,

19:08.189 --> 19:11.275

to eat ketchup anymore.

I already threw out
all my underwear.

- Nobody.

about to fully rob you,

19:27.124 --> 19:29.001
and I don't yet have
a great permanent solution

19:29.001 --> 19:30.419
for not robbing people.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.713
But if you want to stay, sure.

People need pills.
