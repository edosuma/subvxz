00:31.879 --> 00:36.200
Anyone whose name was not found
written in the book of life

00:36.520 --> 00:39.320
was thrown into the lake of fire.
(Rev 20:15)

02:09.680 --> 02:11.120
- I can't. I need hard evidence.

02:13.680 --> 02:16.199
- Hard evidence. Don't you get it?

02:16.560 --> 02:18.280
- Their lawyers will destroy us.

02:18.360 --> 02:18.759
Hey!

02:18.840 --> 02:21.080
- We are about to print the last article.

02:21.159 --> 02:23.520
- Andrzej, we need to be careful.

02:24.080 --> 02:25.120
- Piotr's got evidence.

02:25.599 --> 02:28.520
- Does he know? This is his private matter.

02:28.599 --> 02:29.879
- He is doing his job.

02:29.960 --> 02:32.800
- I won't let it go. I must meet
the lawyers and let them decide.

02:33.159 --> 02:34.319
- Yeah. Whatever.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.199
- Thank you.

02:40.560 --> 02:43.759
- And?
- He'll meet the lawyers and decide.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.520
Fuck.

02:52.280 --> 02:55.800
- It won't run tomorrow.
- You lied to me.

02:59.400 --> 03:03.520
- They need more info.
- You got all there is.

03:08.360 --> 03:11.800
Another source has to confirm it.

03:15.400 --> 03:18.639
- Don't fuck with me.
- I'm not.

03:31.520 --> 03:33.759
You'd better hurry up.

03:34.400 --> 03:36.319
Shit!

03:57.439 --> 03:59.759
- Hello.
- Hi.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.360
What are we having?

04:03.719 --> 04:06.639
- Beer.
- Pint? Half?

04:07.280 --> 04:12.000
- Can we get out of here?
- Sure.

04:21.040 --> 04:23.160
Thanks.

04:27.560 --> 04:31.680
- Listen...
- I won't tell you anything.

04:32.040 --> 04:34.560
But soon everyone will know.

04:34.879 --> 04:37.800
So wait. Like everyone else.

04:38.639 --> 04:41.959
It's the last article in the series.

04:43.639 --> 04:46.360
Just a few more days.

04:49.399 --> 04:53.319
I need this information.
Try to understand it.

04:53.920 --> 04:57.000
I do. And I'm going home.

06:59.879 --> 07:02.600
You won't find anything there.

07:02.959 --> 07:05.680
Only tried to check my email.

07:06.759 --> 07:09.399
Did you sleep well?

07:10.040 --> 07:12.439
As usual.

07:14.680 --> 07:17.199
I'm gonna go then.

07:17.560 --> 07:20.480
About your article on Hydro...

07:24.319 --> 07:26.720
Be careful.

07:39.759 --> 07:42.399
- Minister, the honeymoon is over.

07:42.480 --> 07:45.560
- I understand the aim of the
process is to account me

07:45.639 --> 07:48.920
for the promises I've made. But those
decisions are crucial for energy security.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.680
Will the government address the
issue of the Hydro foundation?

07:53.759 --> 07:56.120
- As the Minister of Economy, aren't you

07:56.199 --> 07:58.639
interested whether there
has been a fraud?

07:58.720 --> 08:04.399
- The investigation still continues.
So I can't really say.

08:04.480 --> 08:06.720
- However, the Kurier
reporters found out...

08:18.839 --> 08:21.480
Financial Director top suspect

08:24.240 --> 08:27.360
Grodecki is a thief. We have evidence.

08:27.680 --> 08:30.800
The allegations are serious and risky.

08:31.160 --> 08:34.480
They'll sue us
to clear their reputation.

08:34.799 --> 08:39.720
- And they will win.
- So we rewrite the CBI statement?

08:40.639 --> 08:44.759
You want to tell the truth
or be the first?

08:58.240 --> 08:59.799
Come on.

09:01.879 --> 09:03.159
Look out!

09:04.559 --> 09:10.240
- Who's going to the Hydro conference?
- They won't say anything.

09:10.559 --> 09:13.200
We're holding for release.

09:13.519 --> 09:18.039
But Piotr got right info
on the foundation's money flow.

09:18.360 --> 09:23.080
The protocol says
we need info from various sources.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.240
- They did break you.
- We're a respected newspaper.

09:28.600 --> 09:31.240
Who earned you this respect?

09:31.320 --> 09:34.440
- We already wrote about it.
- And we will.

09:34.919 --> 09:38.559
- Why the fuck?
- Let the CBI do their job.

09:39.279 --> 09:43.519
If they confirm our intel,
we'll be sitting pretty.

09:44.840 --> 09:47.559
Looks like you do as you're told.

09:47.879 --> 09:52.120
First find hard evidence,
then play a smart ass.

09:52.639 --> 09:55.840
We've been working on this for months.

09:56.200 --> 10:00.120
Poking around this shit
is no fun for me.

10:01.720 --> 10:06.639
If he's innocent, his lawyers
will crush the entire paper.

10:07.039 --> 10:10.279
My source's gonna fucking pull out.

10:10.720 --> 10:13.639
Hard evidence won't pull out!

10:18.840 --> 10:21.559
I don't recognize you.

10:25.720 --> 10:28.240
Maybe it is a safer way out.

10:36.840 --> 10:39.759
There's one thing we can do.

10:40.080 --> 10:42.200
Your source.

10:42.519 --> 10:47.759
If she reveals her ID,
the allegations will come from her.

10:48.080 --> 10:51.799
- We might...
- ...sell the informer.

10:52.120 --> 10:54.559
We've got nothing else.

10:56.840 --> 11:01.080
People don't come to us
so that we hide behind them.

11:01.399 --> 11:04.519
- Catchy.
- You fucking said it.

11:30.080 --> 11:34.000
Revealing your source
will make things easier.

11:34.600 --> 11:38.879
I sign your stories with my name
so I risk the most.

11:38.960 --> 11:41.200
You gain the most.

11:44.399 --> 11:47.320
You should protect what you care for.

11:47.399 --> 11:49.679
- Meaning?
- Your name.

11:50.039 --> 11:52.399
Go fuck yourself.

11:54.279 --> 11:56.440
I will.

11:57.320 --> 12:02.840
The Hydro scandal continues.
We're waiting for a press conference.

12:03.159 --> 12:06.679
The company will comment
on Kurier articles

12:07.000 --> 12:11.120
that attack its financial director
Daniel Grodecki.

12:11.480 --> 12:16.879
Grodecki says he waits for the results
of the CBI investigation.

12:17.200 --> 12:20.919
Now we're going over
to the conference.

12:24.799 --> 12:26.720
Good afternoon.

12:27.039 --> 12:31.240
The Hydro management board
have looked into the case

12:32.039 --> 12:36.759
of Hydro's financial director
accused of embezzlement.

12:37.480 --> 12:41.200
The CBI report
will soon confirm our findings.

12:41.519 --> 12:44.039
The allegations are groundless.

12:44.960 --> 12:48.080
Where did the fuckers get the report?

12:48.399 --> 12:54.080
Regretfully, Director Grodecki
decided to seek career opportunities

12:54.159 --> 12:55.799
outside our company.

12:56.279 --> 12:59.200
Why does he quit if he's innocent?

12:59.559 --> 13:04.559
...open a discussion
about the ethics of media.

13:05.120 --> 13:06.000
Come on.

13:06.080 --> 13:06.720
Thank you.

15:05.399 --> 15:09.519
This is Weronika Zawadzka.
Someone's following me.

15:09.840 --> 15:12.360
A tall man. In a dark hoodie.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.919
Hold on.

15:18.759 --> 15:21.279
A false alarm. Sorry.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.960
- Time off.
- In a sec.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.240
More info or our deal is off.

15:40.559 --> 15:45.159
- Lovely Irish beef.
- We run out of ours?

15:46.200 --> 15:48.360
You have one hour.

15:48.840 --> 15:55.559
- Can't everyone eat their own?
- Europe would be useless then.

15:56.039 --> 15:59.679
- How are you?
- The story's up in the air.

16:00.480 --> 16:05.679
Don't give a damn about our work.
I'm asking how you're doing.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.200
He has to pay for that.

16:11.159 --> 16:15.080
- You're gonna regret it.
- You don't get it.

16:15.399 --> 16:19.519
That's why you only do articles
on local libraries.

16:22.480 --> 16:25.200
And you're gonna get fucking killed.

16:37.200 --> 16:39.600
I think it's yours.

16:41.440 --> 16:42.919
It is.

16:45.519 --> 16:47.399
Thank you.

16:51.840 --> 16:54.960
All of them should apologise.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.519
No apologies around here.

16:58.879 --> 17:01.279
No such tradition.

17:03.639 --> 17:05.240
Haniu...

17:11.759 --> 17:12.720
Thank you.

17:33.480 --> 17:36.119
Don't screw it up.

17:44.640 --> 17:46.720
Fuck, yes.

17:47.440 --> 17:49.559
What's up?

17:52.400 --> 17:54.519
Gotta go.

17:58.759 --> 17:59.599
See ya.

18:22.359 --> 18:24.559
In my office.

18:25.519 --> 18:28.440
How did the Hydro report leak out?

18:33.279 --> 18:35.799
My report?

18:35.880 --> 18:38.079
Leak, meaning what?

18:39.119 --> 18:43.319
Its spokesman has just referred
to our findings.

18:43.640 --> 18:46.079
Did you talk to them?

18:48.279 --> 18:49.160
Are you suspecting me?

18:49.640 --> 18:53.279
I'm only trying to find out
how it happened.

18:53.599 --> 18:55.440
Does your report incriminate Grodecki?

18:56.720 --> 19:01.680
As a director managing the budget,
he made a few inflated transactions.

19:04.960 --> 19:08.039
- So we have nothing.
- I'll try harder.

19:08.119 --> 19:10.359
- No.
- Yes.

19:10.440 --> 19:13.079
I want to finish it.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.200
That's why I'm worried.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.400
Your call for help.

19:20.559 --> 19:24.480
- Three false alarms in two weeks.
- I know. I'm sorry.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.920
There are things...

19:36.400 --> 19:39.720
...over which even I have no control.

19:48.240 --> 19:52.559
- I can't save you from your demons.
- Can I go now?

19:58.079 --> 20:02.920
What about a soft version?
Questions instead of theses.

20:03.960 --> 20:07.240
People don't want to read questions.

20:07.599 --> 20:12.000
But we know nothing.
Hydro refers to the CBI report.

20:12.319 --> 20:15.240
So Piotr is better than the CBI?

20:15.599 --> 20:19.319
A catchy phrase for my business card.

20:21.720 --> 20:25.440
- What's this?
- Hard evidence you wanted.

20:29.960 --> 20:33.559
Eight million?
And they didn't find it?

20:33.640 --> 20:35.440
They didn't know where to look.

20:35.519 --> 20:38.640
We waited for the CBI report.

20:39.519 --> 20:42.640
It's their fault they missed this

20:42.960 --> 20:46.680
and they didn't catch Grodecki
red-handed.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.640
If anyone asks,
the article was written by Monika.

20:50.720 --> 20:52.440
Off we go!

21:03.920 --> 21:06.240
What now?

21:07.599 --> 21:09.480
You're going to see Kowalik.

21:09.559 --> 21:10.559
Are you sure?

21:14.640 --> 21:15.440
We've got it.

22:25.160 --> 22:27.000
Enjoy your meal!

22:31.279 --> 22:34.440
- We should talk.
- Let's eat first.

22:45.880 --> 22:48.000
All right.

22:48.640 --> 22:50.960
What is it?

22:51.319 --> 22:53.920
It means you stole it.

22:54.720 --> 22:57.160
New evidence against Grodecki

22:59.319 --> 23:01.799
- You believe it?
- Did you steal it or not?

23:01.880 --> 23:02.640
Kuba!

23:06.240 --> 23:10.160
I'm not a thief
if that's what you mean.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.400
Cool!

23:13.759 --> 23:16.480
You've really calmed me down.

23:17.880 --> 23:20.200
Gonna ride my bike.

23:24.039 --> 23:25.960
Kuba!

23:31.319 --> 23:33.920
I work for both of you.

23:34.279 --> 23:36.880
For your security.

23:37.240 --> 23:39.640
Nothing else matters.

23:40.440 --> 23:43.240
But security has its price.

23:43.319 --> 23:46.039
And one pays it if they have to.

23:46.359 --> 23:47.839
No mercy.

23:48.640 --> 23:51.839
I don't have a clue what you mean.

23:53.319 --> 23:55.440
You don't.

23:56.799 --> 23:58.519
You don't.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.200
I'm sorry.

24:27.759 --> 24:30.559
What's going to happen now?

24:30.640 --> 24:32.000
Nothing.

24:32.400 --> 24:34.240
Nothing will change.

24:47.640 --> 24:50.200
You'll go to jail.

24:50.279 --> 24:52.200
No.

24:53.759 --> 24:57.039
Jail isn't for people like me, love.

25:33.599 --> 25:37.319
- You leaving?
- Yes. Will you read it?

25:40.039 --> 25:45.039
Look, I sign your articles
but I don't like it at all.

25:46.119 --> 25:49.400
It's your story now. Enjoy the fact.

25:50.279 --> 25:54.400
I respect you for taking the story
to the very end.

25:54.839 --> 25:57.480
It can't have been easy.

25:57.559 --> 25:59.440
Turn off the lights, would you?

26:16.400 --> 26:18.920
What do you want?

26:22.000 --> 26:24.920
I don't think it's a good idea.

26:27.480 --> 26:29.599
As you wish.

26:30.599 --> 26:32.680
I know where it is.

27:28.240 --> 27:30.359
Hi.

27:30.680 --> 27:32.480
Hi. Come in.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.559
You want a drink?

27:42.079 --> 27:46.000
- No, thanks. Is Ewa around?
- In the garden.

27:51.519 --> 27:54.960
You wanted to see me so here I am.

27:57.160 --> 27:59.079
Piotrek...

28:03.640 --> 28:04.920
I wanted to talk.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.359
- I won't change a word.
- I get it.

28:10.960 --> 28:15.839
- So you know...
- ...more than you do.

28:16.319 --> 28:19.400
- Wait!
- What is it?

28:22.960 --> 28:25.480
- Kuba.
- What about him?

28:27.599 --> 28:30.319
Take care of him.

28:35.440 --> 28:38.680
Are you going anywhere?

28:42.640 --> 28:47.240
People like you are usually given
suspended sentences.

28:48.640 --> 28:51.920
Or you'll be released after a year.

28:52.640 --> 28:56.359
- Piotrek!
- He's never even met me.

29:00.839 --> 29:03.759
You're my brother.

29:05.880 --> 29:09.519
I didn't know you worked
for that foundation.

29:09.839 --> 29:12.119
When I saw the documents,
it was too late.

29:12.519 --> 29:13.759
It's fine.

29:18.559 --> 29:24.920
- You don't even sign the articles.
- I would if we weren't family.

29:28.960 --> 29:31.880
Look, I bear no grudges.

29:33.319 --> 29:36.240
I got myself into this shit.

29:42.640 --> 29:45.000
Is it Father's?

29:46.759 --> 29:47.480
Yeah.

29:55.200 --> 29:57.799
Did he say anything?

29:58.880 --> 30:00.440
You don't want to know.

30:05.759 --> 30:08.599
Keep it. I'm trying to quit.

30:09.519 --> 30:12.240
You always wanted to have it.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.440
Thanks.

30:27.839 --> 30:30.640
- Talk to Ewa.
- What about?

30:34.759 --> 30:36.079
She's in the garden.

30:54.400 --> 30:56.319
Hi.

30:56.640 --> 31:01.160
How does it feel
to send your own brother to jail?

31:02.960 --> 31:05.480
He did it himself.

31:05.799 --> 31:10.720
- He's an honest man.
- Not according to our investigation.

31:11.039 --> 31:13.200
Prick.

31:14.160 --> 31:16.680
It's not personal.

31:20.160 --> 31:23.680
You're screwed up.
I always thought so.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.839
- Not always.
- Always.

33:25.519 --> 33:27.640
Go away.

33:29.359 --> 33:31.480
Get out!

34:30.880 --> 34:33.599
You can't do this!

34:33.679 --> 34:35.840
On the contrary.

34:39.360 --> 34:42.039
Where is Piotr Grodecki?

34:42.119 --> 34:45.920
You might respect the fact
he lost his brother.

34:49.880 --> 34:51.880
We have guests.

34:51.960 --> 34:55.519
You have no right
to touch my computer.

34:56.159 --> 34:58.519
- We do.
- On what grounds?

34:59.159 --> 35:03.079
Proceedings to take evidence
you seem to hide.

35:03.400 --> 35:06.000
Where's the external drive?

35:06.440 --> 35:07.960
In my arse.

35:10.239 --> 35:12.800
Shall I ask them to look into it?

35:15.800 --> 35:18.559
Please search Mr Grodecki's bag.

35:18.639 --> 35:20.480
- Hey man, what are you doing?

35:20.559 --> 35:23.480
- Do something!
- Can I talk to him?

35:23.920 --> 35:26.000
Only if you talk sense into him.

35:26.079 --> 35:26.639
Come on.

35:26.719 --> 35:28.039
Leave me alone.

35:28.440 --> 35:29.039
- Come on.

35:37.480 --> 35:40.400
- All my work is here!
- Who's your source?

35:40.800 --> 35:44.159
- Nice try.
- Tell me before they get it.

35:44.480 --> 35:47.119
- I don't know.
- What the fuck?

35:47.199 --> 35:52.679
Her name's Sara.
We used chat rooms and email.

35:53.079 --> 35:57.199
- You said you knew her.
- But not her identity!

35:57.760 --> 36:02.559
It all adds up. All documents
lead to the Hydro Foundation.

36:02.639 --> 36:06.400
- The drive has no info on the source?
- None.

36:06.760 --> 36:09.079
Someone framed you.

36:09.679 --> 36:12.760
- Let them enjoy it.
- Why?

36:12.840 --> 36:15.519
Because it doesn't matter now.

36:15.599 --> 36:17.559
We'll minimise damages at least.

36:34.920 --> 36:36.320
Here you are.

36:44.159 --> 36:45.719
Happy reading.

36:46.280 --> 36:47.519
Excuse me.

37:15.599 --> 37:18.360
- To see Colonel Grodecki.
- Your pass?

37:22.119 --> 37:23.280
Thanks.

37:39.760 --> 37:44.320
I always started
with Nepomucen's feet.

37:47.679 --> 37:50.400
Now I've started with his head.

37:53.679 --> 37:56.199
And he looks different.

38:03.320 --> 38:06.440
It's time to go, Dad.

38:09.039 --> 38:12.880
For fuck's sake,
it's the funeral of your son!

38:18.679 --> 38:21.440
A thief and a suicide.

38:21.519 --> 38:23.840
Let it go.

38:26.559 --> 38:28.480
No.

38:48.760 --> 38:52.079
It hurts to see a man pass away.

38:54.480 --> 38:58.000
It hurts more when it is someone

38:58.360 --> 39:01.880
whom I've known since he was a boy,

39:02.199 --> 39:05.719
a son of my dear friend.

39:08.440 --> 39:12.880
Someone for whom
I held ceremonies of baptism,

39:13.199 --> 39:16.519
First Communion, and confirmation.

39:17.679 --> 39:23.000
Now it is my painful duty
to place his ashes in the ground

39:23.559 --> 39:26.880
and commend his soul to God.

39:28.679 --> 39:32.960
You hurried, Daniel,
to the next world...

39:35.079 --> 39:41.000
Apparently, you had your reasons,
which we are not entitled to judge...

39:42.760 --> 39:45.960
Our good Lord shall do it for us.

39:46.840 --> 39:51.159
For He is the ultimate judge
of our matters

39:51.519 --> 39:54.639
and our only hope in this world.

40:04.239 --> 40:06.360
Congratulations.

40:08.760 --> 40:10.880
Mr Grodecki!

40:11.760 --> 40:14.360
My name's Tomasz Nawrot.

40:14.440 --> 40:18.480
- I knew your brother very well.
- I know who you are.

40:19.039 --> 40:21.800
Please accept my condolences.

40:22.800 --> 40:24.960
Thank you.

40:28.360 --> 40:31.760
I have a lot of respect
for your work.

40:52.559 --> 40:55.199
We need to talk.

40:55.519 --> 40:57.880
It's not a good time.

40:58.199 --> 41:00.760
It's about Sara.

41:02.840 --> 41:05.360
I know her identity.

41:05.719 --> 41:09.440
- How?
- I checked it to make sure.

41:10.840 --> 41:15.760
It was Daniel. You were in touch
with your own brother.

41:17.760 --> 41:22.159
- What are you...
- The chat room, emails, it was him.

41:22.519 --> 41:25.440
- Stop it!
- I have evidence.

41:33.039 --> 41:35.159
OK. I got it. Thanks.

41:35.679 --> 41:38.400
Leave me fucking alone.

43:22.519 --> 43:25.239
ten months later

43:52.320 --> 43:56.239
- I knew it. Chilling out?
- Lunchtime.

43:56.599 --> 43:59.199
You handled the Road Authorities?

43:59.280 --> 44:01.760
It's not a bakery.
It will be done by tomorrow.

44:04.559 --> 44:06.679
One burger, please.

44:09.199 --> 44:12.880
- Never wanted to get promoted.
- You did what you could.

44:14.840 --> 44:18.440
The guy grants fake loans
for huge money.

44:18.800 --> 44:23.920
Monika from your ex-team
collects scandals like merit badges.

44:25.519 --> 44:27.840
So here's to her.

44:59.039 --> 45:01.440
- Water?
- No, thanks.

45:02.239 --> 45:04.760
You're not taking my calls.

45:05.280 --> 45:08.199
It's hard to get in touch with you.

45:08.519 --> 45:12.440
- What do you want?
- Spend Easter with me.

45:12.800 --> 45:15.119
- Easter?
- Yes.

45:15.440 --> 45:18.000
To celebrate Sunday Easter breakfast.

45:19.559 --> 45:22.039
What's there to celebrate?

45:28.760 --> 45:30.119
Do come.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.920
At least his hobby is cool.

45:51.920 --> 45:55.840
- A word on Kurier's accusations?
- Ridiculous.

45:56.480 --> 46:01.000
Like last year, when they attacked
Hydro's director.

46:01.920 --> 46:06.039
So your bank didn't grant
inflated mortgage loans?

46:06.360 --> 46:10.880
- You can't make money this way.
- But you can launder it.

46:11.239 --> 46:13.440
You from Kurier too?

46:13.760 --> 46:17.000
Did he tell you anything
we could print?

46:17.320 --> 46:18.920
He told me to talk to his lawyer.

46:20.159 --> 46:23.079
- So what do we have?
- Nice pics.

46:24.360 --> 46:26.599
That's not much.

46:26.920 --> 46:28.079
Will be back in a minute.

46:36.559 --> 46:38.800
Can we talk?

46:43.280 --> 46:48.480
- How's Rafał? Uptight?
- Like every boss.

46:51.840 --> 46:56.159
Get back to our team.
It will do you good.

46:56.960 --> 46:59.880
I could use your help now.

47:01.360 --> 47:06.280
That guy, Adrian Bogusz...
A complicated case.

47:08.039 --> 47:12.760
I don't know what to do
or whom to put on this story.

47:21.239 --> 47:24.519
They were sent to Kurier this morning.

47:29.920 --> 47:33.960
- Skalski?
- Uh-huh. The Minister of Economy...

47:34.280 --> 47:37.400
- And she is...?
- Here the fun begins.

47:37.719 --> 47:40.360
Adrian Bogusz's wife.

47:43.239 --> 47:45.639
I don't care.

47:47.719 --> 47:49.400
Excuse me.

47:50.159 --> 47:52.079
Yes?

47:55.840 --> 47:58.519
We've certainly met.

47:59.199 --> 48:01.519
Today? Now?

48:02.280 --> 48:04.320
And the address?

48:16.119 --> 48:18.039
Good afternoon.

48:18.679 --> 48:21.119
Take a seat, please.

48:21.440 --> 48:23.920
Mr Grodecki? I'm Marek Szulc.

48:24.440 --> 48:27.360
Can I have your ID, please?

48:36.400 --> 48:39.639
- What's this all about?
- No idea.

48:40.360 --> 48:46.920
Formalities completed,
let me proceed.

48:50.320 --> 48:54.239
According to the will
of Mr Daniel Grodecki,

48:55.199 --> 48:59.159
today at 2 pm,
Ms Ewa Grodecka, the widow,

48:59.239 --> 49:03.519
and Mr Piotr Grodecki,
the brother of the deceased,

49:04.840 --> 49:07.159
are to receive this package.

49:09.599 --> 49:12.519
This is all from me. Thank you.

49:14.960 --> 49:17.360
What is this?

49:17.719 --> 49:20.239
I have no idea.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.119
Is this a joke?

49:35.440 --> 49:38.760
March 30th. 4.30 pm.
In two hours.

49:39.079 --> 49:41.519
There's also this.

49:41.840 --> 49:44.679
Let me check the coordinates.

49:51.320 --> 49:54.440
The middle of nowhere near Łuków.

50:05.800 --> 50:09.320
Access denied. Authorised users only.

50:09.639 --> 50:12.440
It's blocked. It won't open.

50:12.800 --> 50:15.920
It's important we get there on time.

50:45.519 --> 50:47.920
We're on time.

50:54.480 --> 50:57.400
What's going on here?

51:54.039 --> 51:56.159
Piotr!

53:04.920 --> 53:06.639
Fuck!

53:07.000 --> 53:08.400
This is Bogusz.

53:09.519 --> 53:12.920
- I'll call an ambulance!
- He's trapped.

53:15.360 --> 53:17.880
Help me get him out!

53:20.719 --> 53:22.840
Leave him!

53:23.159 --> 53:25.679
The car's going to explode!

53:28.039 --> 53:30.159
What Abraham?

53:31.079 --> 53:33.320
There's no time!

53:41.400 --> 53:43.519
Fuck...

53:46.000 --> 53:47.920
Get in.
