WEBVTT

00:09.075 --> 00:10.409
What, you've never heard
of the girl

00:10.411 --> 00:13.178
who came home after being
abducted 13 years ago?

00:13.180 --> 00:15.214
Who's that?
That is a blonde-haired,

00:15.216 --> 00:16.281
blue-eyed piece
of raw sewage.

00:16.283 --> 00:18.984
And I didn't get your name.
It's Carter.

00:18.986 --> 00:19.918
Here we go.

00:19.920 --> 00:22.354
You can never have anything
to do with him again.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.990
Do you understand me?

00:25.692 --> 00:27.226
Do you understand me?

00:27.228 --> 00:29.161
Crash!
Hey!

00:29.163 --> 00:29.928
Hey, baby Bird.

00:29.930 --> 00:31.430
I want him just as much
as you do.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.432
Well, he's all yours.
You hear that?

00:33.434 --> 00:35.401
Carter says
you're all mine.

00:38.405 --> 00:39.705
Oh, no, no, I can't-
I can't do this.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.573
Not unless you tell me
it's over with David.

00:41.575 --> 00:44.309
Have you ever played Seven
Minutes in Heaven?

00:49.849 --> 00:51.483
That spin doesn't count.
Yes, it does.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.852
I wish I could've been
your first.

00:54.854 --> 00:58.123
Hey, I'll call you.
What?

00:58.125 --> 00:59.091
Call you.

00:59.093 --> 01:00.659
Your mom is here.

01:00.661 --> 01:04.630
Carter, I'm gonna stop
looking for your mom.

01:13.606 --> 01:17.142
â™ª Outside the lines...

01:17.144 --> 01:17.643
Are you okay?

01:17.645 --> 01:20.779
There's a permanent marker
in my makeup bag.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.347
And, now that
I think about it,

01:22.349 --> 01:23.415
I can't remember
the last time

01:23.417 --> 01:26.218
I fully removed
my eyeliner.

01:26.220 --> 01:28.687
It does look good, though.
Hey, Bird called.

01:28.689 --> 01:29.988
Are you guys having
a problem?

01:29.990 --> 01:32.758
What, other than the fact
she's "Slutty McSlutsky,"

01:32.760 --> 01:35.160
the biggest slut
in Slutsville? No, we're fine.

01:35.162 --> 01:38.130
Good, because I said
she could come over.

01:39.666 --> 01:42.334
I guess I know the answer
to, "Are you mad at me?"

01:43.803 --> 01:46.505
Thanks, sweetie,
I can take it from here.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.843
Is this about Crash?

01:50.845 --> 01:52.077
What about Crash?

01:52.079 --> 01:55.380
Uh, you giving me
the silent treatment.

01:55.382 --> 01:57.983
No, look, Bird,
just because

01:57.985 --> 01:59.084
I don't talk to you
for five minutes

01:59.086 --> 02:00.953
doesn't mean I'm giving you
the silent treatment.

02:00.955 --> 02:05.591
Or call or text
or acknowledge my existence?

02:05.593 --> 02:09.795
I'm going kinda crazy
without you.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.030
And it makes me sad
that you're perfectly

02:12.032 --> 02:13.866
okay without me.

02:13.868 --> 02:16.568
Okay, fine.
Yes, it's about Crash.

02:16.570 --> 02:19.705
You have no idea how much
I hate to admit that.

02:19.707 --> 02:22.941
You can't be jealous
about me and Crash.

02:22.943 --> 02:24.042
We're just friends.

02:24.044 --> 02:26.478
I know, but tell that
to my head.

02:26.480 --> 02:30.182
I've got this 3D IMAX movie
of the two of you together

02:30.184 --> 02:34.820
playing over and over, and I
can't stop thinking about it.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.355
Babe, I'm sorry, okay?

02:36.357 --> 02:39.024
I really believed you when
you said you weren't into him,

02:39.026 --> 02:42.094
because that's what you told
everyone all the time.

02:42.096 --> 02:45.497
I was just trying
to convince myself,

02:45.499 --> 02:47.499
which I didn't.

02:47.501 --> 02:48.734
Oh!

02:48.736 --> 02:52.004
I hate not being
in control of my feelings.

02:52.006 --> 02:52.905
I hear you.

02:52.907 --> 02:54.640
See, okay,
that's the other thing.

02:54.642 --> 02:57.943
I can't be into the same guy
you're into-- that's weird.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.912
Don't even worry
about it, okay?

02:59.914 --> 03:00.946
We're all the same
to Crash,

03:00.948 --> 03:04.249
just one on a potential list
of girls to bang.

03:04.251 --> 03:06.451
Well, I have
no intention of being that.

03:06.453 --> 03:08.287
None of us do, and yet--

03:08.289 --> 03:10.322
All right, you know what?
I have to resolve this.

03:10.324 --> 03:12.391
I'm sick of running
away from it.

03:12.393 --> 03:14.660
Do you know where
he lives?

03:14.662 --> 03:16.028
I think it's best
you just call him.

03:16.030 --> 03:19.431
Bird, you're telling someone you
like them for the first time,

03:19.433 --> 03:20.933
but you really
don't wanna tell them,

03:20.935 --> 03:22.267
and you also really
don't wanna even

03:22.269 --> 03:23.101
like them in the first place,

03:23.103 --> 03:24.603
but you're also wondering
if they like you, too.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.238
I'm not having that
conversation over the phone.

03:26.240 --> 03:29.741
I just really think he wouldn't
want you to go to his home.

03:29.743 --> 03:30.676
Why?

03:30.678 --> 03:33.779
Just trust me, okay?

03:33.781 --> 03:35.847
He wouldn't.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.282
Okay, well,
you know what?

03:37.284 --> 03:39.484
That's not
good enough for me.

03:44.257 --> 03:46.792
I told you.

03:46.794 --> 03:49.328
So, what?
Who cares?

03:49.330 --> 03:50.596
I'm guessing he will.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.297
<i>(car alarm chirps)</i>

04:02.108 --> 04:03.275
(knocking)

04:03.277 --> 04:05.477
(woman)
What?

04:05.479 --> 04:08.847
Uh, hi.
I'm looking for Crash.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.716
Who?

04:10.718 --> 04:12.384
Oh, hi.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.119
My name's Carter.
I'm a friend of his.

04:14.121 --> 04:16.822
Is he here?
Who?

04:16.824 --> 04:20.225
Crash.
Crash ain't here.

04:20.227 --> 04:20.826
Oh.

04:20.828 --> 04:23.629
Okay, well, would you mind
telling him I stopped by?

04:23.631 --> 04:25.931
(scoffs)
Get out!

04:25.933 --> 04:27.599
(Carter)
But wait.

04:29.402 --> 04:31.069
Go on.

04:31.071 --> 04:32.337
Let's go.

04:32.339 --> 04:35.907
Please don't tell him
I was here.

04:35.909 --> 04:38.110
(sighs)

04:48.688 --> 04:54.026
â™ª There you go,
there you stay â™ª

04:54.028 --> 04:55.727
â™ª Keeping low

04:55.729 --> 04:57.929
â™ª Never wanna play

04:57.931 --> 05:00.465
â™ª You've been up
and down, down â™ª

05:00.467 --> 05:02.634
â™ª You've been low,
low, low â™ª

05:02.636 --> 05:07.906
â™ª Pretending
to not feel alone â™ª

05:08.041 --> 05:13.645
â™ª Pretending
to not feel alone â™ª

05:15.748 --> 05:16.915
Whoo!

05:16.917 --> 05:20.052
(crowd cheering)

05:21.988 --> 05:23.889
You won!

05:29.962 --> 05:30.829
Thanks.
Yeah.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.965
Congratulations-- you have
a perfect record this season.

05:33.967 --> 05:36.201
We've only had two meets.
Which is perfect.

05:36.203 --> 05:38.737
How'd you guys do
in the relay?

05:38.739 --> 05:41.139
We got massacred,
as per usual.

05:41.141 --> 05:42.741
It'd help if everyone
didn't do it

05:42.743 --> 05:45.077
just for college
applications.
(laughs)

05:45.079 --> 05:47.412
I wanted to tell you,
the other night...

05:47.414 --> 05:49.581
that was a lot of fun.

05:49.583 --> 05:52.417
I had a really good time.

05:52.419 --> 05:55.220
I'm serious.
I was surprised.

05:55.222 --> 05:57.089
I think you actually
melted my brain.

05:57.091 --> 05:59.124
Yeah, okay, can we
not talk about it?

05:59.126 --> 06:02.828
Of course, we don't have
to talk about it.

06:03.529 --> 06:07.532
So, I hear there's a good chance
you could become team captain.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.434
That's very impressive
for a junior.

06:09.436 --> 06:10.869
Hey, what're you
doing tonight?

06:10.871 --> 06:12.504
I have a science poster
to do,

06:12.506 --> 06:16.775
and then they just slammed us
with a bunch English reading.

06:16.777 --> 06:19.077
Well, I know that I'm not
as exciting as either of those,

06:19.079 --> 06:23.615
but I was hoping that
we could do something.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.685
You and me?

06:26.687 --> 06:28.053
Like a date?

06:28.055 --> 06:30.722
As in a date, yes.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.458
But you want me
to bring Carter?

06:33.460 --> 06:35.160
No, I don't.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.762
But you like Carter.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.597
She wouldn't go out with me
because she told me

06:38.599 --> 06:41.566
that you liked me,
which I never knew.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.301
I'd-- I'd always thought
of you as more of a--

06:43.303 --> 06:44.770
No, don't say it.

06:44.772 --> 06:46.104
Come on,
you've said it enough.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.572
And-- And I was
very wrong about that.

06:47.574 --> 06:51.877
Is there anything that I can do
to get you to like me again?

06:53.279 --> 06:54.212
I don't know.

06:54.214 --> 06:57.516
Just a shot, that's all
I'm asking for.

07:01.053 --> 07:01.620
This is crazy.

07:01.622 --> 07:05.390
I mean you standing here,
saying these things to me?

07:05.392 --> 07:06.391
Is that a yes?

07:06.393 --> 07:08.960
I can pick you up at 8:00.
It'll be fun.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.729
Come on.
Okay.

07:10.731 --> 07:13.432
Thank you.

07:15.134 --> 07:17.836
Hey.
That's mine.

07:19.305 --> 07:21.106
Hi.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.841
Thanks.

07:24.310 --> 07:26.077
You know what?
Keep the change.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.413
I'm gonna need that hat.

07:35.621 --> 07:36.588
(woman)
What?

07:36.590 --> 07:39.791
(clears throat)
Uh, Spotina's Pizza.

07:45.398 --> 07:47.999
You need to pay.

07:49.936 --> 07:51.970
How much?

07:53.339 --> 07:55.407
Hi.

07:57.743 --> 07:59.244
Cool hat.

07:59.246 --> 08:01.246
Come talk to me?

08:01.248 --> 08:04.449
I'd rather not.

08:05.685 --> 08:07.085
Please?

08:23.202 --> 08:26.571
Well, you called
this meeting.

08:26.573 --> 08:28.974
Is it to ask me
for another favor?

08:28.976 --> 08:30.909
Maybe you wanna reprimand me
again for stealing your car.

08:30.911 --> 08:33.211
Did you travel all this way
to make sure that I'd

08:33.213 --> 08:37.649
fully understand that you
are absolutely not into me?

08:37.651 --> 08:41.152
â™ª

08:50.162 --> 08:53.031
So you <i>are</i> into me.

09:04.243 --> 09:05.744
Well, that happened.

09:06.846 --> 09:09.180
Help.

09:14.086 --> 09:16.354
So, now what?

09:16.356 --> 09:18.023
I don't know.

09:18.624 --> 09:20.792
Take me somewhere.

09:20.794 --> 09:21.726
Like, your favorite place.

09:21.728 --> 09:25.897
Well, that would be
right here, right now.

09:26.899 --> 09:29.768
Well, I appreciate
the extraneous flirting,

09:29.770 --> 09:32.337
but I was serious.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.639
So was I.

09:34.641 --> 09:35.941
Uh...

09:35.943 --> 09:38.877
my life hasn't been
exactly scenic.

09:38.879 --> 09:44.149
I've spent most of it in some
pretty nasty detention centers.

09:45.918 --> 09:47.919
Okay, well,
let's go to one.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.322
I wanna see one.

09:51.223 --> 09:52.190
No.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.892
I mean, I'd like
to take you by

09:53.894 --> 09:55.527
and show you off.

09:55.529 --> 09:57.429
I-- I spent
a lot of time with people

09:57.431 --> 10:00.231
who didn't see anything
in me.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.833
They'd be pretty shocked
if I showed up

10:01.835 --> 10:04.336
with someone like you.

10:04.338 --> 10:07.639
I'm pretty shocked myself,
actually.

10:07.641 --> 10:10.909
What, because
you're such a bad person?

10:10.911 --> 10:15.647
That's the abridged version,
but yeah.

10:16.315 --> 10:18.950
What if I don't think
you are?

10:18.952 --> 10:22.187
Then you'd be wrong.
Really?

10:22.189 --> 10:24.322
Prove it.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.658
Okay.

10:27.393 --> 10:29.761
Where are we going?

10:31.197 --> 10:33.665
Instead of taking you
to my favorite place,

10:33.667 --> 10:37.202
I'm gonna take you
to my least favorite place.

10:39.572 --> 10:41.539
Okay.

10:43.409 --> 10:47.212
Help yourself to anything
you would like.

10:47.214 --> 10:48.780
Not the beer or the wine.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.915
And I don't think
I can give away

10:50.917 --> 10:54.419
any free motor-oil yet,
but, uh...

10:54.421 --> 10:56.087
perhaps a nice Skaddens?

10:56.089 --> 10:57.722
Yeah?
Yeah.

10:57.724 --> 10:59.624
Loaded with peanuts
for your journey.

10:59.626 --> 11:01.593
Thank you.
Yeah.

11:01.595 --> 11:05.864
So what else brings you
to the Quick-N-Easy?

11:05.866 --> 11:08.266
Well, I had a question...

11:08.268 --> 11:10.735
Yeah?
... actually, yeah.

11:10.737 --> 11:14.105
Um, you know Gabe, right?

11:14.107 --> 11:15.874
Yeah, I know Gabe.

11:15.876 --> 11:21.479
Yeah, well, he--
He asked me out on a date.

11:22.715 --> 11:24.149
Oh.

11:24.151 --> 11:27.185
But I-- I was wondering
if you think I should go,

11:27.187 --> 11:28.486
or if maybe you--

11:28.488 --> 11:31.022
No, I definitely think
that you should go.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.123
Um...

11:32.125 --> 11:35.460
'cause Gabe's
a really great catch.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.829
You know, he's--
He's like a jock,

11:37.831 --> 11:39.931
and he's really popular.

11:39.933 --> 11:43.435
That's like a score.

11:43.437 --> 11:45.603
He asked you out?

11:45.605 --> 11:46.738
Yeah.

11:46.740 --> 11:51.209
You don't have
any other

11:51.211 --> 11:53.578
contradictory reactions?

11:53.580 --> 11:57.882
Uh-uh, no.
I don't think so.

11:57.884 --> 12:00.018
All pretty "dictory."

12:00.020 --> 12:02.587
Okay, well...

12:02.589 --> 12:05.323
thank you
for your advice.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.892
Mm-hmm.
And the Skaddens.

12:07.894 --> 12:10.161
Yeah, you need
anything else?

12:10.163 --> 12:12.731
No. no.

12:14.934 --> 12:16.134
All right, well, see you.

12:16.136 --> 12:19.204
â™ª Feel like you used to

12:19.206 --> 12:23.575
â™ª Helpless,
feel like you use to â™ª

12:23.577 --> 12:28.246
â™ª Feel like you used to

12:28.248 --> 12:32.217
â™ª The future's brighter
from a skylight â™ª

12:32.219 --> 12:37.322
â™ª The future's brighter
from a skylight â™ª

12:37.324 --> 12:39.691
â™ª The future's brighter

12:39.693 --> 12:41.426
â™ª From a skylight

12:41.428 --> 12:46.164
â™ª The future's brighter
from a skylight â™ª

12:46.166 --> 12:48.767
â™ª The future's brighter

12:48.769 --> 12:50.935
â™ª From a skylight

12:50.937 --> 12:53.138
â™ª The future's brighter

12:53.140 --> 12:54.939
â™ª from a skylight

12:54.941 --> 12:59.611
â™ª The future's brighter
from a skylight â™ª

12:59.613 --> 13:01.780
â™ª The future's brighter

13:01.782 --> 13:05.283
â™ª from a skylight

13:18.297 --> 13:19.831
What is this place?

13:19.833 --> 13:22.801
Can't you tell?

13:22.803 --> 13:25.203
This is my
after-school hangout,

13:25.205 --> 13:28.740
my babysitter,
my community center.

13:28.742 --> 13:30.708
It's my Outward Bound
for wayward kids.

13:30.710 --> 13:31.643
When I was 13,

13:31.645 --> 13:33.178
I'd come here and get high,

13:33.180 --> 13:34.312
shoot off
bottle rockets.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.580
We put a zip-line in.

13:35.582 --> 13:38.249
It's Disneyland, right?

13:42.721 --> 13:47.158
So...

13:50.129 --> 13:53.364
I had a brother.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.900
Okay.
Ben.

13:55.902 --> 13:58.603
He was younger.
He was an idiot.

13:58.605 --> 14:01.539
When we were little,
my mom dropped us off

14:01.541 --> 14:02.307
at my Aunt Di's house.

14:02.309 --> 14:04.209
Says she'll be back later
to pick us up,

14:04.211 --> 14:07.679
but later never
happened.

14:07.681 --> 14:11.783
So one afternoon
I'm supposed to watch Ben.

14:11.785 --> 14:15.687
I'm too cool, though, to sit
around and play Battleship

14:15.689 --> 14:17.222
with a ten-year-old.

14:17.224 --> 14:18.857
So I bring him here.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.326
He hates it,
says it's ugly and dirty,

14:21.328 --> 14:23.361
and, "Why do I have
to play here?

14:23.363 --> 14:24.863
"What's wrong
with Battleship?

14:24.865 --> 14:27.665
Why can't we just go home?"

14:27.667 --> 14:30.902
So I'm like, "Ben, just go
sit in the truck."

14:30.904 --> 14:36.207
Me and my friends were
sitting over there drinking.

14:42.147 --> 14:46.851
All of a sudden
the truck's in flames.

14:54.159 --> 14:56.461
Oh, my God.

14:56.463 --> 14:59.030
The police tried to blame me
and my friends,

14:59.032 --> 15:01.399
But he was playing with the
ignition, and there was some

15:01.401 --> 15:02.800
weird defect with the truck.

15:02.802 --> 15:05.703
Oh, my God.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.080
Crash?

15:16.082 --> 15:18.683
That's not a name,
that's an insurance claim.

15:18.685 --> 15:21.085
You said that Carter's
friends with this guy?

15:21.087 --> 15:22.020
No, not friends.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.455
He's more something
she can use to torment me.

15:24.457 --> 15:27.926
Wow. Well, he's not gonna be
a problem after Monday.

15:27.928 --> 15:30.762
Second charge of possession
with intent to distribute.

15:30.764 --> 15:31.963
This is gonna be
a slam dunk.

15:31.965 --> 15:34.032
He'll get at least a couple
years in Deerfield.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.400
Well, this is
some career I got,

15:35.402 --> 15:37.302
pursuing the criminals
in my daughter's life.

15:37.304 --> 15:40.371
I should transfer to something
less stressful,

15:40.373 --> 15:43.207
like the bomb squad.

15:45.210 --> 15:48.713
So are we still on
for Monday night?

15:48.715 --> 15:50.548
What's Monday night?

15:50.550 --> 15:52.650
You better be joking.

15:52.652 --> 15:53.618
No, what's Monday night?

15:53.620 --> 15:55.954
You know, I should just
use my head as a brick,

15:55.956 --> 15:57.388
because I'm that stupid.

15:57.390 --> 16:01.459
I pay for a hotel room,
order champagne,

16:01.461 --> 16:03.394
chocolate-covered
strawberries...

16:03.396 --> 16:04.963
It's our anniversary.

16:04.965 --> 16:05.930
You asked me what I wanted,

16:05.932 --> 16:07.765
and I said just to
wake up with you.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.000
It's not gonna happen,
is it?

16:09.002 --> 16:11.803
No, it's gonna happen.

16:11.805 --> 16:12.470
How?

16:12.472 --> 16:14.272
Because you obviously
haven't told David

16:14.274 --> 16:15.940
that you're gonna
be away for the night.

16:15.942 --> 16:17.141
I can still tell him.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.343
He's not gonna care.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.345
He spends 90 percent
of his life

16:20.347 --> 16:23.915
in his office, Kyle.

16:23.917 --> 16:27.685
I'll work on it.

16:30.389 --> 16:31.422
<i>(cell phone vibrates)</i>

16:31.424 --> 16:34.592
â™ª Watch the sun go down

16:34.594 --> 16:37.829
â™ª I watch the sun go down

16:38.764 --> 16:42.367
â™ª And I wander around

16:42.369 --> 16:45.003
â™ª And I wander around

16:45.738 --> 16:49.674
â™ª It's here
then it's gone â™ª

16:50.609 --> 16:53.211
Look, I destroy
everything I touch.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.513
I don't wanna destroy you.

16:55.515 --> 16:58.549
Okay, well, if you haven't
already noticed,

16:58.551 --> 17:01.085
I'm not really
the easily destroyed type.

17:01.087 --> 17:03.421
â™ª Didn't even have time

17:03.423 --> 17:04.555
â™ª To get it straight...

17:04.557 --> 17:05.757
Let's go.
This is horrible.

17:05.759 --> 17:07.458
I don't want you ever
coming here again.

17:07.460 --> 17:10.128
No, see, I come here
all the time.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.629
That's the thing.

17:11.631 --> 17:14.365
Listen to me.

17:15.300 --> 17:18.770
This is not who you are.

17:18.772 --> 17:20.838
Okay?

17:20.840 --> 17:22.940
You are more
than the worst thing

17:22.942 --> 17:24.475
that has ever happened
to you.

17:24.477 --> 17:27.145
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

17:27.147 --> 17:29.714
Yeah, you are.

17:31.183 --> 17:34.685
And I lied before.

17:34.687 --> 17:36.521
You did destroy me,

17:36.523 --> 17:40.091
but I've never
been happier.

17:43.929 --> 17:47.432
â™ª Watch the sun go down

17:47.434 --> 17:51.469
â™ª I watch the sun go down

17:58.177 --> 18:00.812
Who are you expecting?
Max.

18:00.814 --> 18:02.346
Max?
Yeah.

18:02.348 --> 18:03.481
(Gabe)
Hi, Grant.

18:03.483 --> 18:05.616
Oh, it's for you.

18:05.618 --> 18:08.519
Okay.
Good to see you, too.

18:08.521 --> 18:09.353
Hi.
Wow--

18:09.355 --> 18:10.521
Hey.
Yeah, we should just go.

18:10.523 --> 18:14.125
I-- I forgot
my sweater.

18:14.127 --> 18:16.194
Hey.
Hi.

18:16.196 --> 18:17.528
Hi.

18:17.530 --> 18:18.362
You look nice.

18:18.364 --> 18:21.599
Hey, man, that's my line.
Making me look bad.

18:21.601 --> 18:22.433
Grant.

18:22.435 --> 18:23.734
Oh, finally you're here.

18:23.736 --> 18:25.369
Let's go.
Okay.

18:28.173 --> 18:29.740
Have fun.

18:29.742 --> 18:32.076
Yeah, we intend to.

18:32.078 --> 18:36.114
You know, I'm really starting
to like that guy.

18:36.116 --> 18:37.949
Me, too.

18:39.685 --> 18:41.018
(knocking)

18:41.020 --> 18:42.286
Come in.

18:44.223 --> 18:45.089
Hey, sorry
to bother you.

18:45.091 --> 18:50.228
I just had the most unexpected
conversation with my mom.

18:50.230 --> 18:50.628
Oh?

18:50.630 --> 18:55.032
Apparently, she bought
a overnight spa getaway

18:55.034 --> 18:55.633
at a silent auction.

18:55.635 --> 18:58.236
She was planning on
bringing her friend Lois,

18:58.238 --> 19:01.539
but then Lois suddenly
needs a hip transplant.

19:01.541 --> 19:04.775
Is anyone in this story
under the age of 70?

19:04.777 --> 19:06.110
Yeah, I know.

19:06.112 --> 19:09.247
Well, she wants me
to go with her.

19:09.249 --> 19:12.083
The room has
a hot tub, uh, facials,

19:12.085 --> 19:15.586
and something called
a chromatic color wrap.

19:15.588 --> 19:18.356
And 24 hours
of nonstop criticism.

19:18.358 --> 19:21.826
After four decades,
I think I can handle it.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.127
It is Monday night.

19:23.129 --> 19:25.496
It's okay
if I go, right?

19:25.498 --> 19:26.197
Sure.

19:26.199 --> 19:29.033
You've been working so hard
you deserve a break.

19:29.035 --> 19:31.102
Well, I'd rather
go with you.

19:32.638 --> 19:34.071
Well...

19:34.073 --> 19:37.875
it wouldn't be
the same.

19:38.677 --> 19:42.113
I'll let you
get back to work.

20:03.235 --> 20:06.070
Oh... sorry.

20:06.072 --> 20:09.774
You seem
pretty happy.

20:09.776 --> 20:12.009
Yeah, I guess I am.

20:12.011 --> 20:15.846
I don't suppose I'm gonna get
any more information on that.

20:15.848 --> 20:16.881
Nope.

20:16.883 --> 20:19.750
Well, you know what,
as long as you're happy.

20:19.752 --> 20:23.721
If parents had a flag,
that would be our motto.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.122
We just want
our kids happy.

20:25.124 --> 20:27.091
Is there enough
in there for me?

20:27.093 --> 20:29.227
No.
Yeah.

20:29.229 --> 20:31.095
Have some.

20:31.097 --> 20:32.630
Here you go.

20:32.632 --> 20:34.131
Thanks.

20:34.133 --> 20:36.067
You know,
there's not enough, uh,

20:36.069 --> 20:38.035
junk food
in this house.

20:38.037 --> 20:38.736
We've got five people.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.505
We need more than just
one pint of ice cream.

20:41.507 --> 20:42.840
We've got
gluten-free cookies.

20:42.842 --> 20:44.909
Oh, no.
Have you tried those?

20:44.911 --> 20:46.143
Those things
are terrible.

20:46.145 --> 20:47.912
Wait, didn't you
buy them?

20:47.914 --> 20:48.246
Yes.

20:48.248 --> 20:51.148
I wanted a cookie that didn't
make me wanna eat cookies.

20:51.150 --> 20:54.118
But I don't think
that feeling ever goes away.

20:54.120 --> 20:56.554
Even babies, you know,
they can only drink milk.

20:56.556 --> 20:57.622
I think they're thinking,

20:57.624 --> 21:00.891
"You know what this milk
could really use?

21:00.893 --> 21:02.460
A cookie."

21:02.462 --> 21:04.061
Oh.

21:04.063 --> 21:05.563
I think you just
made a joke.

21:05.565 --> 21:08.466
I am not an animal,
I am a human being.

21:08.468 --> 21:13.771
I know it's-- it's like
Arnold Schwarzenegger gone bad.

21:13.773 --> 21:14.572
You're too young.

21:14.574 --> 21:15.673
You don't know
that reference.

21:15.675 --> 21:17.575
Yeah, I do.
It's "The Elephant Man."

21:17.577 --> 21:20.244
Yeah, my mom used--

21:22.180 --> 21:24.415
She used to be
really into movies.

21:24.417 --> 21:25.650
It was kind of
her thing.

21:25.652 --> 21:28.052
Every time
I'd get sick or anything,

21:28.054 --> 21:29.487
she'd, like,
sit with me in bed,

21:29.489 --> 21:31.322
and we'd watch movie
after movie.

21:31.324 --> 21:36.127
Kind of like a mini film-
festival, but with the flu.

21:36.129 --> 21:36.694
Anyway, sorry.

21:36.696 --> 21:39.096
I'm sure you don't wanna hear
about any of that.

21:39.098 --> 21:43.934
I was actually thinking
how grateful I am to her.

21:44.202 --> 21:48.973
She made you very happy,
gave you a great life.

21:53.211 --> 21:56.547
That's a really amazing thing
for you to say.

21:58.383 --> 22:00.351
Thank you.

22:05.057 --> 22:08.059
Well, you have the rest.

22:08.061 --> 22:10.628
I have
a court case Monday

22:10.630 --> 22:13.931
that I have to
prepare for.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.599
Good luck,
I hope you win.

22:15.601 --> 22:16.133
Thanks, me, too.

22:16.135 --> 22:18.502
I'll finally get
that Crash off the street.

22:18.504 --> 22:19.337
He's so worthless.

22:19.339 --> 22:21.472
Don't talk about him
like that.

22:21.474 --> 22:23.240
That's horrible.

22:23.242 --> 22:25.943
I thought you were
done with him.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.812
Well, I'm not.
Since when?

22:27.814 --> 22:29.013
Since today,
actually.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.949
Okay, well, at least
it's not serious.

22:31.951 --> 22:32.516
It is serious.

22:32.518 --> 22:34.719
You don't know
what kind of life he's led.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.187
I'm sure
it's been tough,

22:36.189 --> 22:38.689
and maybe it's to blame
for what he's become.
Maybe?

22:38.691 --> 22:43.561
But it doesn't matter anymore,
because now it's who he is.

22:43.563 --> 22:46.364
How can you
even say that?

22:47.999 --> 22:53.170
That boy has had no one
to believe in him...

22:53.172 --> 22:55.473
ever.

22:57.342 --> 22:58.242
Now he does.

22:58.244 --> 23:01.512
I don't think the judge that's
going to see him on Monday

23:01.514 --> 23:04.415
is gonna share
your optimism.

23:06.985 --> 23:07.852
Why?
What's gonna happen?

23:07.854 --> 23:11.222
This is his second arrest--
a fairly sizable bust--

23:11.224 --> 23:13.891
and from what I can tell,
his only defense

23:13.893 --> 23:15.126
is "I just won't
do it again ."

23:15.128 --> 23:18.062
No judge is going to buy that
with his juvie record.

23:18.064 --> 23:20.231
Carter,
he's going to prison.

23:20.233 --> 23:23.033
For-- For how long?

23:23.035 --> 23:25.603
At least three years.

23:27.172 --> 23:28.773
Is that definite.

23:28.775 --> 23:30.541
No, it--

23:30.543 --> 23:33.344
it could be five,
it could be ten.

23:33.346 --> 23:35.312
Carter...

23:35.314 --> 23:37.948
baby, believe me,
he knows this.

23:37.950 --> 23:39.483
And the fact
that he didn't tell you

23:39.485 --> 23:42.820
he's about to go to prison
is all the information

23:42.822 --> 23:45.689
you need to know
about this boy.

23:45.691 --> 23:46.390
Yes, it does.

23:46.392 --> 23:49.627
It tells me he's not
gonna be there on Monday.

23:56.768 --> 23:58.002
Today was perfect.

23:58.004 --> 24:00.037
Yeah.

24:00.039 --> 24:01.038
Yeah, I know.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.206
I would've been
the last perfect day

24:02.208 --> 24:03.407
you ever would've had
with me.

24:03.409 --> 24:07.411
I couldn't end today telling you
I was about to go to prison.

24:10.148 --> 24:12.450
Well...

24:12.452 --> 24:15.219
today isn't over yet.

24:15.221 --> 24:20.524
â™ª

24:23.495 --> 24:24.295
â™ª I'm coming for you

24:24.297 --> 24:26.397
â™ª You better
as fast as you can â™ª

24:26.399 --> 24:27.598
Oh, I suck at this.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.433
Listen, everyone
sucks at this.

24:29.435 --> 24:32.570
You know, I believe
miniature golf courses

24:32.572 --> 24:33.838
are designed by sadists.

24:33.840 --> 24:37.708
Were you at Tyler Bolander's
mini-golf birthday party?

24:37.710 --> 24:38.943
Oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:38.945 --> 24:43.080
Yeah, three kids ended up
in the emergency room.

24:43.082 --> 24:44.081
No, no, three?

24:44.083 --> 24:45.349
Try six.
What?

24:45.351 --> 24:46.016
Oh, that's right.

24:46.018 --> 24:48.719
Your mom came and picked you up
in a squad car.

24:48.721 --> 24:51.455
The fight got much worse
after you left.

24:51.457 --> 24:52.156
Ugh.

24:52.158 --> 24:54.024
We go back
a long way.

24:54.026 --> 24:56.494
Yeah, we do.
Kindergarten.

24:56.496 --> 24:57.428
Marcy Katz' class.

24:57.430 --> 24:59.230
Do you remember she told us
she was a lesbian?

24:59.232 --> 25:02.766
She came out to
a room of five-year-olds.

25:02.768 --> 25:04.668
You probably forgot
my class photo.

25:04.670 --> 25:05.870
Are you kidding me?

25:05.872 --> 25:06.570
Your bangs were--

25:06.572 --> 25:08.639
I don't need to see it
or relive it, thanks.

25:08.641 --> 25:11.542
And they lined up our photos,
and it was like boy,

25:11.544 --> 25:15.045
girl, girl, boy, monster.
Monster.

25:15.047 --> 25:17.548
Yes, always.

25:22.420 --> 25:24.889
You know what I realized?

25:26.224 --> 25:28.359
What?

25:28.361 --> 25:30.995
I am like your sister.

25:30.997 --> 25:35.065
Yeah, I guess so, huh?

25:40.238 --> 25:44.642
I'd be happy if you were
the only person in my life.

25:47.078 --> 25:50.281
Traveling from adventure
to adventure.

25:50.283 --> 25:51.382
Yeah, I'd like that.

25:51.384 --> 25:53.751
I've always wanted
to visit all 50 states.

25:53.753 --> 25:54.985
I really wanna go
to that place,

25:54.987 --> 25:57.721
you know, where you can stand
on all the four states

25:57.723 --> 25:58.489
at the same time?

25:58.491 --> 26:00.925
I wanna actually
live in Alaska.

26:00.927 --> 26:01.625
Really?

26:01.627 --> 26:02.693
Not forever,
but, like,

26:02.695 --> 26:04.328
just to say
that I've lived in Alaska.

26:04.330 --> 26:08.499
I wanna go to Utah and sell
hot tubs to rich skiers.

26:08.501 --> 26:10.801
That's your lifelong dream?

26:10.803 --> 26:13.437
No, I just made it up.

26:13.439 --> 26:15.005
Is that not--

26:15.007 --> 26:16.874
No?

26:20.178 --> 26:21.979
Carter, let's go.

26:21.981 --> 26:25.015
Let's do it.
We can do this.

26:25.017 --> 26:26.417
Crash.
No, I mean it.

26:26.419 --> 26:28.385
All right, I don't
wanna wait three years

26:28.387 --> 26:29.687
to start my life
with you.

26:29.689 --> 26:30.454
It's already started.

26:30.456 --> 26:31.922
And it's not gonna end
if you have to go

26:31.924 --> 26:33.023
to prison for a while.

26:33.025 --> 26:36.360
No, you think it won't,
but it will.

26:36.362 --> 26:38.195
Okay.

26:38.197 --> 26:41.165
Well, then,
have faith in me.

26:41.866 --> 26:43.934
I have faith in you.

26:46.404 --> 26:48.305
What?

26:48.307 --> 26:50.708
Crash, what's wrong?

26:50.710 --> 26:51.809
Sit down.

26:51.811 --> 26:54.144
Crash.

26:54.146 --> 26:57.414
Look, I don't want
three years

26:57.416 --> 27:01.218
of-- of you seeing me
in a-- a green jumpsuit

27:01.220 --> 27:04.755
in some dirty room being told
that you can't touch me, okay?

27:04.757 --> 27:07.291
I'd rather
you see me like this,

27:07.293 --> 27:08.859
even if it's for
the last time.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.361
Crash.

27:25.443 --> 27:27.945
Bye, Carter.

27:27.947 --> 27:30.981
Crash,
where are you going?

27:30.983 --> 27:33.384
Please don't go.

27:33.386 --> 27:35.753
Crash!

27:47.732 --> 27:51.468
<i>(cell phone rings)</i>

27:54.305 --> 27:55.739
Hello?

27:55.741 --> 27:57.574
(sighs)

27:57.576 --> 28:00.577
(sighs)
No.

28:00.579 --> 28:02.846
Have you heard from him?

28:02.848 --> 28:03.614
All right.

28:03.616 --> 28:06.216
Will you tell me
if you do?

28:06.218 --> 28:07.518
Thanks.

28:07.520 --> 28:08.819
Bye.

28:18.463 --> 28:19.930
When are they
going to invent a phone

28:19.932 --> 28:21.432
that rings
when you want it to?

28:21.434 --> 28:22.966
If it was
up to me, today.

28:22.968 --> 28:25.069
Wait, who are you
waiting to hear from?

28:25.071 --> 28:26.637
Max.

28:26.639 --> 28:28.305
Just call him.

28:28.307 --> 28:29.840
No.
Why?

28:29.842 --> 28:31.241
I wanna know
if he likes me,

28:31.243 --> 28:34.745
and I'll only know
if he calls me.

28:34.747 --> 28:37.681
Or, you know,
you could just ask him.

28:37.683 --> 28:41.085
Yeah, 'cause I'm such
an emotional daredevil.

28:41.087 --> 28:43.020
That's what I did
with Crash.

28:43.022 --> 28:44.354
That's you.

28:44.356 --> 28:45.389
It's not me.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.624
Taylor, are you really willing
to risk losing someone

28:47.626 --> 28:49.827
who you really like
just because you're too scared

28:49.829 --> 28:51.028
to ask them
if they like you?

28:51.030 --> 28:52.796
Come on,
you like Max, right?

28:52.798 --> 28:54.565
Yeah, a lot.

28:54.567 --> 28:57.167
Okay, well,
why take the risk?

28:57.169 --> 28:59.903
Look, you know what,
if there's anything I've learned

28:59.905 --> 29:00.704
in the last few months,

29:00.706 --> 29:03.674
it's that you never
actually know how much time

29:03.676 --> 29:05.075
you've got left
with someone.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.076
You know there's
all this stuff

29:06.078 --> 29:08.779
that I wish
I had said to my mom.

29:08.781 --> 29:09.880
And now there's
all this stuff

29:09.882 --> 29:11.582
I'm never gonna get
to say to Crash.

29:11.584 --> 29:14.318
What won't you
get to say to Crash?

29:14.320 --> 29:14.885
Everything.

29:14.887 --> 29:18.055
I don't even know what
I'm not gonna get to say to him.

29:18.057 --> 29:19.556
That's...

29:19.558 --> 29:21.792
that's the whole point.

29:23.228 --> 29:24.128
I'm sorry.

29:24.130 --> 29:25.429
This is my stuff.

29:25.431 --> 29:27.731
Max is not
gonna disappear on you.

29:27.733 --> 29:29.299
Is that what Crash
is doing?

29:29.301 --> 29:30.901
Well, I hope not,
but that's what

29:30.903 --> 29:32.035
it's starting to look like.

29:32.037 --> 29:33.070
You have to go get him.

29:33.072 --> 29:36.807
How? I have absolutely
no idea where he is.

29:36.809 --> 29:38.008
You have to.

29:38.010 --> 29:40.010
You're my role model.

29:42.914 --> 29:44.148
Fine.

29:44.682 --> 29:46.283
So, you'll see Max?

29:46.285 --> 29:48.719
You'll tell him
you like him?

29:48.721 --> 29:50.020
Yes.

29:50.022 --> 29:51.755
Come here.

29:51.757 --> 29:53.857
It's gonna be great,
I promise.

29:53.859 --> 29:55.425
Don't worry.

29:55.427 --> 29:57.027
Thanks.

30:03.701 --> 30:07.437
(sighs)
Hi, it's me.

30:08.840 --> 30:09.740
Look, Crash,

30:09.742 --> 30:12.409
this is the last message
I'm gonna leave you.

30:12.411 --> 30:13.844
You're gonna spend
your whole life

30:13.846 --> 30:16.113
running away
from your problems...

30:16.115 --> 30:17.514
running away from
the person

30:17.516 --> 30:20.384
that you're terrified
of becoming.

30:20.386 --> 30:23.020
But that's not life.

30:23.022 --> 30:24.488
Okay?
That's--

30:24.490 --> 30:25.722
That's just running
from it.

30:25.724 --> 30:28.592
And I know I've never
been in your position,

30:28.594 --> 30:29.259
or even close,

30:29.261 --> 30:31.495
but, Crash, I have spent
the last few months

30:31.497 --> 30:33.530
running away from stuff,
and I can tell you

30:33.532 --> 30:35.799
it is exhausting.

30:35.801 --> 30:37.768
Please don't let
the decisions you make now

30:37.770 --> 30:42.105
ruin the rest
of your life.

30:42.107 --> 30:45.876
Please come home.

30:45.878 --> 30:47.778
Please.

30:51.983 --> 30:54.651

31:00.593 --> 31:03.293
Bird!

31:03.295 --> 31:04.061
Anything?

31:04.063 --> 31:07.564
I'm sorry,
nobody's seen him.

31:07.566 --> 31:08.498
(sighs)

31:08.500 --> 31:10.634
Carter, I think
you need to accept

31:10.636 --> 31:12.569
that he's not
gonna show up.

31:12.571 --> 31:14.504
I really think
that he might this time.

31:14.506 --> 31:16.607
That would mean
taking responsibility

31:16.609 --> 31:18.308
and recognizing
that he's made mistakes.

31:18.310 --> 31:20.010
And those are two things
Crash has never done.

31:20.012 --> 31:22.246
No, but I can't
just accept that.

31:22.248 --> 31:23.847
Carter, I know
he cares about you,

31:23.849 --> 31:25.515
but he's not gonna
go to jail just to prove

31:25.517 --> 31:28.986
that he's a good guy.

31:28.988 --> 31:30.888
It's time.

31:30.890 --> 31:33.523
Is he here?

31:33.525 --> 31:34.691
No, he's not.

31:34.693 --> 31:37.628
<i>(metal detector beeping)</i>

31:41.566 --> 31:43.567
Yes, he is.

31:43.569 --> 31:45.269
Hey!

31:46.571 --> 31:47.871
You came.

31:47.873 --> 31:50.107
Yeah, I did.

31:50.109 --> 31:52.175
Did you doubt me?

31:52.177 --> 31:53.343
No.

31:53.345 --> 31:55.779
That's why I'm here.

31:55.781 --> 31:57.648
Hey.
(Bird laughing)

31:57.650 --> 31:58.248
Hey.

31:58.250 --> 32:01.551
I'm stunned.
Yeah, me, too.

32:03.388 --> 32:05.722
Detective Wilson,

32:05.724 --> 32:07.124
should we go in?

32:07.126 --> 32:07.591
No.

32:07.593 --> 32:09.459
Could you please
stand over there?

32:09.461 --> 32:11.361
Why?

32:11.363 --> 32:14.264
Let's just
let them talk, okay?

32:17.969 --> 32:20.137
I talked to
your court-appointed counsel

32:20.139 --> 32:20.938
and the district attorney,

32:20.940 --> 32:22.973
and they agreed
to three years probation

32:22.975 --> 32:25.275
and 100 hours
community service.

32:25.277 --> 32:26.743
What?
It's done.

32:26.745 --> 32:28.178
Your court case is done.

32:28.180 --> 32:29.846
Can I hug you?
No!

32:29.848 --> 32:33.550
What?
What happened?

32:33.552 --> 32:35.018
I'm not going to prison.

32:35.020 --> 32:36.687
What?

32:36.689 --> 32:37.988
Oh, my God.

32:37.990 --> 32:40.057
Wait, he's-- he's not?

32:40.059 --> 32:41.325
Not today.

32:41.327 --> 32:42.059
Congratulations!

32:42.061 --> 32:43.760
Uh, Detective Wilson,
thank you.

32:43.762 --> 32:44.928
I-- I know
you did this. I--

32:44.930 --> 32:46.396
Carter, there's some
more things that I need

32:46.398 --> 32:48.231
to discuss
with Crash, okay?

32:48.233 --> 32:49.833
Please?

32:49.835 --> 32:51.768
It's cool.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.370
(girls tittering)

32:53.372 --> 32:56.206
You have
zero chances left.

32:56.208 --> 32:56.740
Zero.

32:56.742 --> 32:58.775
So, if you even so much
as light up a joint,

32:58.777 --> 33:00.844
you're gonna be behind bars
for three years,

33:00.846 --> 33:02.879
and then after that,
the next step

33:02.881 --> 33:05.749
is spending the rest
of your life in a cage.

33:05.751 --> 33:07.484
I want you to know
that I get it, all right?

33:07.486 --> 33:08.819
You did this because
you love your daughter

33:08.821 --> 33:12.055
more than you hate me,
but you won't be sorry.

33:12.057 --> 33:14.157
I'm going to do everything
in my power to--

33:14.159 --> 33:18.362
to prove to you that
I'm worthy of your daughter.

33:18.364 --> 33:21.999
So, thank you
for this chance

33:22.001 --> 33:24.301
to show you that...

33:24.303 --> 33:26.970
you're wrong about me.

Hey.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.566
So, what did you think?

33:56.568 --> 33:57.501
Pretty nice, huh?

33:57.503 --> 33:59.202
The Park Grand?
What?

33:59.204 --> 34:00.370
You haven't been
to your desk?

34:00.372 --> 34:02.672
No, it's been
a very long day.

34:02.674 --> 34:03.206
I just got back.

34:03.208 --> 34:07.411
Mm, well, there's an envelope
on your desk with a key.

34:07.413 --> 34:08.211
Thanks.

34:08.213 --> 34:08.945
When can you leave?

34:08.947 --> 34:11.181
I'll just drop this off
then I'll grab my bag.

34:11.183 --> 34:12.416
(whispering)
Okay.

34:12.418 --> 34:13.650
Happy anniversary.

34:13.652 --> 34:16.086

Happy anniversary.

34:18.322 --> 34:20.223
(sighs)

34:20.225 --> 34:23.827
Hey, this should go
to the D.A.'s office.

34:23.829 --> 34:25.962
Thanks.

34:28.900 --> 34:29.633

Hi.

34:29.635 --> 34:32.135
Sorry, I didn't mean
to frighten you.

34:32.137 --> 34:34.337
Uh, that's okay.

34:34.339 --> 34:35.272
What's up?

34:35.274 --> 34:37.174
Uh, you forgot
your bathing suit.

34:37.176 --> 34:39.376
You're gonna need that,
aren't you?

34:39.378 --> 34:41.478
Yeah, definitely.
Thank you.

34:41.480 --> 34:42.112
That was stupid.

34:42.114 --> 34:43.980
So, your mom's
picking you up here?

34:43.982 --> 34:46.149
I'll hang out
till she comes.

34:46.151 --> 34:46.950
Great.

34:46.952 --> 34:50.253
I'll just grab my bag.
Oh, here, I got it.

34:50.255 --> 34:52.089
Do you want this?
Uh, leave it.

34:52.091 --> 34:53.890
I'll deal with it
tomorrow.

I've gotta take it.
Yeah, go ahead.

34:59.431 --> 35:01.098
I hope she doesn't
have to cancel.

35:52.184 --> 35:55.519
This a bad time?
Yeah, kind of.

35:55.521 --> 35:57.754
Um, okay.

35:57.756 --> 35:58.188
I can go?

35:58.190 --> 36:00.023
Yeah, that's prob--
that's probably a good idea.

36:00.025 --> 36:01.992
I don't even
get a Skaddens?

36:01.994 --> 36:03.994
You don't get a what?

36:05.663 --> 36:06.229
Nothing.

36:06.231 --> 36:11.034
Um, it was just
this stupid callback.

36:11.036 --> 36:12.269
Bye.

Bye.

you should, too.

Yes.

I'm perfect.

celebrated a birthday together

I can't stay here and be with
my mom at the same time, okay?

40:14.246 --> 40:17.914
I have to choose.
You should not go.

40:17.916 --> 40:20.383
Are you cheating
on David?
