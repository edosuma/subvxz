WEBVTT

00:03.437 --> 00:07.006
Brian. Game starts
in half an hour.

00:07.008 --> 00:09.041
Willie, Timmy's mother told me
they call the pitcher

00:09.043 --> 00:11.310
on the other team
"The Headhunter."

00:11.312 --> 00:13.245
What do you suppose that means?

00:13.247 --> 00:17.149
It means Brian will probably
get on base tonight.

00:17.151 --> 00:21.820
Mom, dad, I feel lucky.

00:21.822 --> 00:24.023
Don't forget to wear
your batting helmet.

00:26.193 --> 00:28.660
- Hi.
- Oh, hi, ALF.

00:28.662 --> 00:30.562
We're gonna go to Brian's game
and then out for pizza.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.664
You want us
to bring you anything?

00:32.666 --> 00:35.267
I'm too depressed to eat.

00:35.269 --> 00:36.668
What's wrong?

00:36.670 --> 00:39.705
Ah, they're fooling around
with the universe.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.507
Read this travesty of journalism

00:41.509 --> 00:43.776
I found
in this week's Inquisitor.

00:46.313 --> 00:50.716
"Amazon Women found
on Alpha Centauri." So?

00:50.718 --> 00:52.551
Everyone knows
that Alpha Centauri's

00:52.553 --> 00:55.954
just a bunch of bowling alleys
and divorced guys.

00:55.956 --> 00:57.689
Oh, ALF,
when will you learn not to take

00:57.691 --> 01:00.392
anything in those tabloids
seriously?

01:00.394 --> 01:02.461
And when I hide something
in the bottom of the garbage

01:02.463 --> 01:04.463
I expect it to stay there.

01:04.465 --> 01:05.931
Alright, here.

01:05.933 --> 01:08.534
But I can't give you back
the melon rinds.

01:08.536 --> 01:11.603
That ship has sailed.

01:11.605 --> 01:14.807
[theme music]

01:44.638 --> 01:47.840
[music continues]

02:13.434 --> 02:14.967
[instrumental music]

02:16.137 --> 02:18.637
Okay, here's the last one.

02:18.639 --> 02:21.240
"What German leader
was responsible

02:21.242 --> 02:24.209
for starting World War II?"

02:24.211 --> 02:25.911
That's a toughie.

02:25.913 --> 02:29.848
It was either Colonel Klink
or Sergeant Schultz.

02:29.850 --> 02:33.218
Probably Klink. Schultz could
have never pulled it off.

02:34.722 --> 02:37.222
- Hi, guys.
- Anything for me?

02:37.224 --> 02:38.824
[chuckles]

02:38.826 --> 02:41.793
There you go, Mr. Mailing List.

02:41.795 --> 02:43.996
"National Cat Society."

02:45.366 --> 02:47.833
Ooh, my Ms. Magazine.

02:49.537 --> 02:51.036
[gasps]

02:51.038 --> 02:52.838
What is it, ALF?

02:52.840 --> 02:56.141
It's from
the National Inquisitor.

02:56.143 --> 02:57.943
So?

02:57.945 --> 03:00.045
Well, I sent them
a nasty letter.

03:00.047 --> 03:03.582
I'm afraid I rather
abused the exclamation point.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.450
They could be mad.

03:05.452 --> 03:07.319
Biting mad.

03:07.321 --> 03:09.188
Zsa Zsa Gabor mad.

03:10.558 --> 03:12.457
Here's a reckless thought.

03:12.459 --> 03:14.793
Why don't you open it
and find out?

03:14.795 --> 03:16.562
It might be booby-trapped!

03:16.564 --> 03:19.698
It could explode
upon contact with fur!

03:20.568 --> 03:23.302
ALF, you're imagining things.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.504
You've obviously never had
a greeting card

03:25.506 --> 03:27.806
go off in your hand.

03:27.808 --> 03:30.008
Here, Lynn, you read it.

03:35.282 --> 03:37.216
ALF, this isn't bad at all.

03:37.218 --> 03:40.219
Drop it. It's gonna blow!

03:40.221 --> 03:42.654
They'd like to know if you'd
consider turning your letter

03:42.656 --> 03:45.224
into an article
for their next issue.

03:45.226 --> 03:47.626
ALF, what did you say
to these people?

03:47.628 --> 03:50.729
I merely told them
that Amazon-type females

03:50.731 --> 03:54.967
do not live in Alpha Centauri,
but on Xerxes Four.

03:54.969 --> 03:57.336
Is that near where Melmac was?

03:57.338 --> 04:00.205
It's in the tri-planet area.

04:00.207 --> 04:04.710
ALF, they're willing to pay you
$250 for the story.

04:04.712 --> 04:06.245
<i> What?</i>

04:08.649 --> 04:10.549
I'm gonna be read
in one of America's most

04:10.551 --> 04:14.686
highly-respected
sleaze tabloids.

04:14.688 --> 04:17.789
If only mom was here
to see this!

04:17.791 --> 04:19.992
[instrumental music]

04:23.297 --> 04:25.430
Joanie, that's too bad.

04:25.432 --> 04:30.135
Well, for what it's worth,
it is never easy breaking up.

04:30.137 --> 04:32.504
You'll feel better
once the bitterness sets in.

04:32.506 --> 04:33.739
[knocking on door]

04:33.741 --> 04:35.073
Listen, I gotta go, okay?

04:35.075 --> 04:37.909
I-I'll talk to you
tomorrow. Bye.

04:37.911 --> 04:40.712
- Is that you again, ALF?
- 'Yeah.'

04:40.714 --> 04:43.148
- 'Can I come in?'
- No.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.452
- Too late.
- ALF, I have to study.

04:47.454 --> 04:50.289
I don't have time
to read your article again.

04:50.291 --> 04:53.358
Then I'll stare at you
until you do.

04:53.360 --> 04:55.627
Suit yourself.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.329
[sighs]

05:04.772 --> 05:06.004
It's fine, ALF.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.706
Oh, arm wrestling
for the captured

05:07.708 --> 05:10.742
mating stock
is really a good hook.

05:10.744 --> 05:14.913
"Good?" You said "Great"
the last four drafts.

05:14.915 --> 05:19.851
ALF, this is only eight
paragraphs in a sleazy magazine.

05:19.853 --> 05:24.156
Are you kidding?
This could launch my career!

05:24.158 --> 05:28.260
Fine. Well, then it's perfect.
Couldn't be better than this.

05:28.262 --> 05:31.063
It redefines journalism
as we know it.

05:31.065 --> 05:34.700
I'd send it in just like it is.

05:34.702 --> 05:37.402
(ALF)
'You hate it, don't you?'

05:37.404 --> 05:39.404
[instrumental music]

05:41.041 --> 05:44.276
Brian, it's not like you
to get a 'D' on a test.

05:44.278 --> 05:45.677
I'm sorry.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.746
Whatever made you think
that Colonel Klink

05:47.748 --> 05:50.615
started World War II?

05:50.617 --> 05:53.352
So it was Sergeant Schultz.

05:53.354 --> 05:55.887
I didn't think he had it in him.

05:55.889 --> 05:59.591
I'd say we've isolated
the problem.

05:59.593 --> 06:03.462
Brian, from now on
you study alone.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.364
And you.

06:05.366 --> 06:07.265
We've been all through this, ALF

06:07.267 --> 06:11.436
most of what you see on
television is for entertainment.

06:11.438 --> 06:13.939
It's not real.

06:13.941 --> 06:18.310
That explains why the California
Raisins don't return my calls.

06:20.147 --> 06:23.382
Hi. Good news, they came in.

06:23.384 --> 06:25.016
What did?

06:25.018 --> 06:27.419
You mean you still
haven't told them, ALF?

06:27.421 --> 06:30.822
Oh, I hate hearing those words.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.724
Oh-oh, it's not
what you think, dad.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.092
See, the Inquisitor asked ALF

06:34.094 --> 06:37.996
to write an article
about Amazon women in space.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.899
The blood is draining
from my head.

06:42.236 --> 06:44.636
ALF, we have been
trying to protect you

06:44.638 --> 06:46.204
from the outside world.

06:46.206 --> 06:49.040
Your writing articles
for a national publication

06:49.042 --> 06:51.376
kind of runs counter to that.

06:51.378 --> 06:52.711
Chill out, Kate.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.079
I did nothing to jeopardize

06:54.081 --> 06:57.048
the good thing
we've got going here.

06:57.050 --> 06:59.017
Lynn, I'd expect this
from an alien

06:59.019 --> 07:00.952
but why on Earth
would you help him?

07:00.954 --> 07:04.256
But, dad, he wrote it under
an assumed name.

07:04.258 --> 07:05.657
"Mr. Universe."

07:05.659 --> 07:07.726
I toyed with "Mr. Know-It-All"

07:07.728 --> 07:10.061
but that was too on the nose.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.898
I've read it, dad.
It's pretty good.

07:12.900 --> 07:16.201
- Pretty good?
- Don't start!

07:16.203 --> 07:18.370
- Let's see it.
- It's on page five.

07:18.372 --> 07:20.138
Oh, when did you
add the part about them

07:20.140 --> 07:23.508
riding around on the backs
of two-headed lizards?

07:23.510 --> 07:25.243
I didn't write that.

07:25.245 --> 07:27.145
Everyone knows
they cruise around

07:27.147 --> 07:31.483
in four-wheel-drive vehicles!
Braless!

07:31.485 --> 07:33.418
This is the same magazine
that broke the story

07:33.420 --> 07:36.555
of Oprah's thin twin
stealing her show.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.457
What do you expect?

07:38.459 --> 07:40.325
That's what's so confusing.

07:40.327 --> 07:42.727
They get the Hollywood
stories right

07:42.729 --> 07:45.797
but miss with the space stuff.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.099
Yeah. Real confusing.

07:48.101 --> 07:51.870
- Okay, what are my options?
- You have no options.

07:51.872 --> 07:54.439
Okay, that's one.

07:54.441 --> 07:56.174
You could sue them?

07:56.176 --> 07:58.376
Now you're speaking my language.

07:58.378 --> 08:00.712
Listen to me.
You're not gonna do anything.

08:00.714 --> 08:04.182
You're just gonna be grateful
this didn't turn out any worse.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.084
Okay, but you better hope

08:06.086 --> 08:09.221
those big-boned babes
don't come after you.

08:09.223 --> 08:12.090
They'd snap you in half
at the pelvis.

08:12.092 --> 08:15.293
[instrumental music]

08:20.501 --> 08:22.801
Marilyn Geiser, please?

08:22.803 --> 08:24.569
Yes, I'll hold.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.706
Stay calm. Stay calm.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.407
[exhales]

08:31.178 --> 08:33.745
Marilyn, babe,
what in the ding-dong heck

08:33.747 --> 08:35.080
are you doing down there?

08:35.082 --> 08:37.582
You're busting my chops!

08:37.584 --> 08:38.917
Who is this?

08:38.919 --> 08:41.853
It's Mr. Universe.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.655
Arnold?

08:43.657 --> 08:45.123
No, the writer!

08:45.125 --> 08:49.160
I wrote the story about
the Amazon women on Xerxes Four.

08:49.162 --> 08:51.296
The one you ruined!

08:51.298 --> 08:53.798
I'm sorry.
Could you be more specific?

08:53.800 --> 08:58.436
The one you changed
to two-headed flying lizards.

08:59.806 --> 09:01.773
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Right.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.475
Oh, hey, sorry about that.

09:03.477 --> 09:05.110
We bought a picture
of a two-headed lizard

09:05.112 --> 09:07.312
and had to use it somewhere.

09:07.314 --> 09:12.150
Oh, and by the way,
everyone loved the article.

09:12.152 --> 09:16.354
You can't tell lies about
my friends and get away with it!

09:16.356 --> 09:21.493
A-are you saying
you were abducted by aliens?

09:21.495 --> 09:23.662
Were you taken forcibly?

09:23.664 --> 09:25.363
- No!
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

09:25.365 --> 09:28.066
So you, uh,
you went voluntarily?

09:28.068 --> 09:30.702
Yeah. No, no.
It was a long weekend.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.804
Her mothers were out of town.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.072
Oops.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.308
[imitates call waiting]

09:36.310 --> 09:38.777
Uh, there goes my call waiting.
I have to go.

09:38.779 --> 09:41.346
Uh, uh, Mr. Universe, uh..

09:41.348 --> 09:45.050
Would you mind granting us
an interview?

09:45.052 --> 09:48.620
We'll pay you $250.

09:48.622 --> 09:50.622
No, I can't!

09:50.624 --> 09:52.357
$500!

09:52.359 --> 09:55.694
Okay, okay, look. I'll tell
you what, Mr. Universe.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.529
By granting us this interview

09:57.531 --> 10:02.133
we'll give you a chance to set
the record straight, I promise.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.938
Could you have that
made out to cash?

10:06.940 --> 10:09.541
Absolutely.

10:09.543 --> 10:11.476
- Fire away.
- Oh, no, no, no.

10:11.478 --> 10:14.512
Not on the phone.
We'll be right over.

10:14.514 --> 10:16.514
Wait! Wait! Hey! Hey!

10:18.685 --> 10:20.385
Willie's gonna freak.

10:23.523 --> 10:25.056
[instrumental music]

10:25.058 --> 10:28.793
Willie, you got a moment
for a pal?

10:28.795 --> 10:30.762
What is it,<i> pal?</i>

10:30.764 --> 10:35.567
Well, remember earlier when all
the blood rushed from your head?

10:35.569 --> 10:38.236
Yes. Why?

10:38.238 --> 10:42.040
- It might happen again.
- What do you mean?

10:42.042 --> 10:43.441
You didn't write
another angry letter

10:43.443 --> 10:46.511
to the National Inquisitor,
now did you?

10:46.513 --> 10:48.146
Another option!

10:48.148 --> 10:51.149
Where were you an hour ago
when I called them?

10:51.151 --> 10:52.851
- You called them?
- Wait.

10:52.853 --> 10:55.320
Save some blood, there's more.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.821
More?

10:56.823 --> 10:58.723
They're on their way over.

10:58.725 --> 11:00.091
[doorbell rings]

11:00.093 --> 11:02.727
Well, they'll fill in the rest.

11:02.729 --> 11:04.796
Well, wh-what did you tell them?

11:04.798 --> 11:08.466
Oh, I called my editor
to express my anger and outrage.

11:08.468 --> 11:10.669
And somehow
she got it in her head

11:10.671 --> 11:13.905
that I had contact with aliens.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.674
What a kook, huh?

11:15.676 --> 11:17.142
[doorbell rings]

11:17.144 --> 11:18.910
Get in the kitchen.

11:18.912 --> 11:22.347
I love it when you
take charge, man. I really do.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.553
Why me?

11:34.227 --> 11:37.429
Hello. Mr. Universe?

11:37.431 --> 11:39.898
I'm sorry. I think you want
the gym down the street.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.867
[chuckles]
That's strange.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.570
I'm sorry. I'm Marilyn Geiser.

11:45.572 --> 11:50.175
We've been communicating with
a Mr. Universe at this address.

11:50.177 --> 11:53.111
We don't receive mail
at this address.

11:53.113 --> 11:55.380
That's pretty lame.

11:55.382 --> 11:58.283
Okay, okay, look, look,
if it's the money

11:58.285 --> 12:00.985
we're willing to go
as high as $750.

12:00.987 --> 12:03.021
[sighs]

12:03.023 --> 12:05.857
I can't help you.
Uh, don't. Uh, plea..

12:05.859 --> 12:09.060
You can see I'm very busy.
Would you mind..

12:09.062 --> 12:11.429
Would you stop that, please?
Plea..

12:11.431 --> 12:13.598
If you don't get out
of here immediately

12:13.600 --> 12:14.799
I'm calling the police.

12:14.801 --> 12:17.802
Okay, hey. Suit yourself.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.672
Come on, Phil.

12:28.348 --> 12:31.683
You owe me a big one, buster.

12:31.685 --> 12:33.451
I really appreciate it.

12:33.453 --> 12:36.287
- Now get them back.
- What?

12:36.289 --> 12:38.923
That yahoo might have
taken my picture!

12:38.925 --> 12:40.458
- Oh, no!
- Yeah!

12:40.460 --> 12:43.661
Get them back before
they drive away with the film.

12:43.663 --> 12:45.029
How?

12:45.031 --> 12:46.798
Do I have to
think of everything?

12:49.970 --> 12:52.637
Oh, miss. Oh, miss?

12:53.974 --> 12:56.741
Will you get out of here?

12:56.743 --> 13:00.545
No, wait.<i> Wait!</i>

13:00.547 --> 13:03.214
What's going on?
Why is dad yelling?

13:03.216 --> 13:04.983
Why is he chasing that van?

13:04.985 --> 13:07.819
The photographer
accidentally took my picture.

13:07.821 --> 13:11.422
- We have to get it back!
- How do we do that?

13:11.424 --> 13:14.225
You're just like your father.

13:14.227 --> 13:17.428
Quick, they're coming.
Get in the kitchen.

13:19.533 --> 13:21.800
I knew you'd change your mind.

13:21.802 --> 13:24.402
What was it, huh? The money?

13:24.404 --> 13:28.106
Okay. Where's that
nice photographer?

13:28.108 --> 13:30.942
Oh, he's out in the van.

13:30.944 --> 13:33.278
He's afraid of you.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.113
Well, if, uh,
I'm gonna do this thing

13:35.115 --> 13:37.348
I wanna have my picture taken.

13:37.350 --> 13:42.053
My, aren't we Mr. Cooperative
all of a sudden.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.656
Hey, Phil! Come on back in.

13:45.959 --> 13:50.361
Well, let's just get right
to it, shall we?

13:52.499 --> 13:57.702
How did the so-called aliens
first make contact with you?

13:59.239 --> 14:01.005
Whoa.

14:01.007 --> 14:03.107
Didn't see that one coming.

14:03.109 --> 14:05.076
You are good.

14:05.078 --> 14:06.778
Hey, Phil.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.048
Nice to see you again.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.783
Oh..

14:11.785 --> 14:13.751
What are you doing?

14:13.753 --> 14:15.453
I'm reloading my camera.

14:15.455 --> 14:18.056
But what happened
to the film you had?

14:18.058 --> 14:20.291
I used it up.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.627
[loudly]
So, what you're saying is

14:22.629 --> 14:27.632
your other film is in the van?

14:27.634 --> 14:29.334
[loudly]
Yeah.

14:30.570 --> 14:33.104
Good, dad. Real subtle.

14:33.106 --> 14:35.073
- What are we gonna do?
- Alright.

14:35.075 --> 14:38.877
We break into a doctor's office,
steal an X-ray machine

14:38.879 --> 14:41.813
and push it back and forth
in front of the van.

14:41.815 --> 14:44.616
ALF, you don't need
a doctor's office.

14:44.618 --> 14:48.186
Then where do you expect me
to get an X-ray machine?

14:48.188 --> 14:50.922
All you have to do
is go into the van

14:50.924 --> 14:53.424
and expose all of the film.

14:53.426 --> 14:56.794
Well, it's a little far-fetched,
but it could work.

14:56.796 --> 15:00.565
Good thinking. That's why
you barely made it into college.

15:00.567 --> 15:01.900
Okay, go.

15:01.902 --> 15:05.303
I'll tell dad to stall.
You guys just go get the film.

15:07.774 --> 15:14.379
Oh, then I found myself
on an examining table

15:14.381 --> 15:16.814
in a room full of light.

15:16.816 --> 15:18.049
Uh..

15:18.051 --> 15:21.753
A kind of light
that I-I've never seen before.

15:23.523 --> 15:28.726
They spoke, but, uh,
their lips never moved.

15:31.064 --> 15:33.431
- Dad.
- Lynn..

15:33.433 --> 15:36.467
Lynn. Really, really glad
to see you.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.803
Uh, Marilyn, Phil,
this is my daughter, Lynn.

15:38.805 --> 15:40.038
- Hi.
- Uh..

15:40.040 --> 15:42.006
These people are
from the National Inquisitor.

15:42.008 --> 15:44.409
I know. It's nice to meet you.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.911
Say, dad, can I talk to you
about something

15:46.913 --> 15:48.880
entirely off the subject?

15:48.882 --> 15:51.816
Of course, dear.
If you'll excuse us..

15:54.587 --> 15:57.021
- So, what do you think?
- So far, so good.

15:57.023 --> 15:59.157
This is the first UFO victim
we've talked to

15:59.159 --> 16:00.491
who speaks in complete sentences

16:00.493 --> 16:04.329
and doesn't wear his name
on his belt.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.864
Lynn, how could you let Brian
do that?

16:06.866 --> 16:08.967
- He's only aiding and abetting.
- Oh.

16:08.969 --> 16:12.437
Besides, you should have heard
ALF's plan.

16:12.439 --> 16:14.939
I don't know how much longer
I can keep this up.

16:14.941 --> 16:16.641
Oh, you're doing great, dad.

16:16.643 --> 16:20.645
That lip thing was inspired.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.947
I don't know how many more
"Star Treks" I've got in me.

16:22.949 --> 16:26.217
Oh, how about the one
where they went to that planet

16:26.219 --> 16:28.419
where all their wishes
came true?

16:28.421 --> 16:30.588
I wish I were there now.

16:30.590 --> 16:31.789
Look, I'll do what I can.

16:31.791 --> 16:34.559
You let me know
as soon as they're safe.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.966
ALF, have you found the film?

16:41.968 --> 16:47.171
No, but they got a picture
of Roseanne Barr in the nude.

16:47.173 --> 16:49.407
That's a keeper.

16:49.409 --> 16:51.609
[shudders]

16:53.646 --> 16:55.713
Whoa.

16:55.715 --> 16:59.150
Oh, hey, they've got
a refrigerator in here.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.019
ALF, hurry up!

17:02.422 --> 17:03.921
Oh, rats!

17:03.923 --> 17:07.692
A great setup like this, and all
he's got in here is film.

17:09.162 --> 17:10.828
Now I'm really hungry.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.167
Go ahead. You were saying..

17:16.169 --> 17:18.770
I found myself

17:18.772 --> 17:23.674
floating weightless
through a dense fog.

17:25.912 --> 17:30.615
It was unlike any fog
I ever floated in before.

17:30.617 --> 17:31.949
Wow.

17:33.453 --> 17:37.722
Darn right wow.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.958
You, uh, you wrote
in your article, um

17:40.960 --> 17:43.961
about how the Amazons used
their, their male captives

17:43.963 --> 17:45.329
as, as love slaves.

17:45.331 --> 17:47.532
Uh, that's kind of personal.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.600
That's why it sells.

17:52.205 --> 17:56.240
So..

17:56.242 --> 18:01.579
Well, there wasn't, uh,
a lot of affection.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.481
[door opens]

18:05.118 --> 18:07.652
- Oh, hi, honey.
- Kate..

18:09.089 --> 18:13.091
Uh, Kate, these people are here
from the Inquisitor.

18:13.093 --> 18:16.160
They're here to get
Mr. Universe's story.

18:18.164 --> 18:20.698
Well, isn't that something.

18:20.700 --> 18:25.770
Where is...Mr. Universe?

18:25.772 --> 18:29.607
- It's okay, honey. They know.
- They know?

18:29.609 --> 18:33.511
About my travels
to other solar systems? Yes.

18:36.049 --> 18:37.748
That's nice.

18:39.385 --> 18:41.385
I'm gonna go check on the baby.

18:41.387 --> 18:44.489
Mrs. Universe, your husband
was just about to tell us

18:44.491 --> 18:46.124
what it was like
to be the main-course

18:46.126 --> 18:48.693
at an Amazon love feast.

18:48.695 --> 18:50.761
Or I could sit in.

18:53.399 --> 18:55.466
Continue, please.

18:58.171 --> 19:00.771
It was very hot.

19:00.773 --> 19:05.843
It was like a heat
I've never felt before.

19:07.180 --> 19:09.814
ALF, did you find it?

19:09.816 --> 19:11.883
Just a few more rolls to go.

19:11.885 --> 19:17.989
However, I could use a cream
soda to wash down this ASA 400.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.957
Just hurry up!

19:19.959 --> 19:21.492
[belches]

19:25.131 --> 19:26.264
[belches]

19:32.205 --> 19:35.673
This is much too good
to waste on an article.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.742
I'm telling you,
if you're interested

19:37.744 --> 19:41.145
I can get you a book deal
out of this.

19:41.147 --> 19:44.815
- Mission accomplished.
- Great. I'll signal dad.

19:50.356 --> 19:54.358
Uh, thanks for the offer, but,
uh, I think I've said enough.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.494
I wish you'd reconsider.

19:56.496 --> 19:57.929
I'd like you to leave now.

19:57.931 --> 20:02.033
I-I can get you an advance
of $1500 right now.

20:02.035 --> 20:06.504
Mrs. Universe,
can't you reason with him.

20:06.506 --> 20:09.674
No offense, Marilyn, but weren't
you the least bit suspicious

20:09.676 --> 20:11.609
when he referred
to the leader of the Amazons

20:11.611 --> 20:15.446
as "Lieutenant Uhura?"

20:15.448 --> 20:17.014
I don't believe you people.

20:17.016 --> 20:20.117
You twist around the truth,
you invade our homes

20:20.119 --> 20:22.486
you take our picture
without my permission

20:22.488 --> 20:25.489
and then you have the nerve
to try to buy me off?

20:25.491 --> 20:27.291
But you ran after us
to come back.

20:27.293 --> 20:29.594
- Shut up, Phil.
- Yes, sir.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.529
What's worse is
you sat here and listened to me

20:31.531 --> 20:35.800
make up story after story
from old "Star Trek" episodes

20:35.802 --> 20:41.239
and not only did you not notice,
you offered me a book deal.

20:41.241 --> 20:42.573
Well..

20:42.575 --> 20:44.342
You obviously haven't made
the transition

20:44.344 --> 20:46.777
back to society very well.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.579
Come on, Phil.

20:53.419 --> 20:54.785
I don't need this, you know.

20:54.787 --> 20:56.387
I've got a picture
of Roseanne Barr

20:56.389 --> 20:58.589
that's gonna make me rich.

21:03.196 --> 21:06.197
Now, the next time
you leave the galaxy, Willie

21:06.199 --> 21:07.531
we go together.

21:07.533 --> 21:09.166
[laughing]

21:09.168 --> 21:11.736
- Way to go, dad.
- I'm proud of you.

21:11.738 --> 21:14.038
Uh, speaking of leaving
the galaxy

21:14.040 --> 21:17.441
I'd like to have a word
with ALF. Where is he?

21:17.443 --> 21:20.811
He said he needed a minute
to cover his tracks.

21:20.813 --> 21:23.314
You mean you left him
in the van?

21:23.316 --> 21:25.716
Hey, it's my first heist.

21:25.718 --> 21:28.219
Oh, no!

21:28.221 --> 21:31.222
Marilyn. Phil. Wait up.

21:34.594 --> 21:36.127
Where's Willie going?

21:37.530 --> 21:41.432
ALF, we all thought
you were in the van.

21:41.434 --> 21:44.235
Willie, stop!

21:44.237 --> 21:46.904
He's a good guy
to have on your side.

21:46.906 --> 21:50.241
And surprisingly fast.

21:50.243 --> 21:52.243
[instrumental music]

21:54.480 --> 21:56.447
ALF calling Fat Man.

21:56.449 --> 21:58.282
ALF calling Fat Man.

21:58.284 --> 22:00.351
Come in, Your Buickness.

22:00.353 --> 22:02.486
(Fat Man)
'Who is calling at this hour?'

22:02.488 --> 22:04.722
It's ALF.

22:04.724 --> 22:06.957
You wanna hear
what I learned this week?

22:06.959 --> 22:09.026
(Fat Man)
'No. I don't.'

22:09.028 --> 22:11.829
I learned that freedom
of the press is a right

22:11.831 --> 22:13.331
not a privilege.

22:13.333 --> 22:15.866
And those rights
should be protected

22:15.868 --> 22:19.236
for without them,
Earthlings are lost.

22:19.238 --> 22:23.007
(Fat Man)
'Didn't you used to go
with that cute little brunette?'

22:23.009 --> 22:28.112
Uh, sir, I can see you're still
one sandwich short of a picnic.

22:28.114 --> 22:30.014
(Fat Man)
'Is that a new outfit?'

22:30.016 --> 22:33.718
Oh, yeah. I had to change it
for legal reasons.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.386
Until next week.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.223
[gasps]

22:40.460 --> 22:42.360
Whoa!

22:42.362 --> 22:45.463
That'll teach me to eat film
before going to bed.

22:47.233 --> 22:48.399
[belches]

22:52.839 --> 22:56.040
[theme music]

23:15.895 --> 23:19.096
[music continues]

23:20.566 --> 23:23.267
[ALF laughs]
