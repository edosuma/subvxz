See? Riding a flying horse
isn't so hard.

01:03.197 --> 01:06.098
Um, Amber? We haven't
<i> started </i> flying yet.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.266
Do we have to do that part?

01:07.268 --> 01:09.134
Don't you want to learn
how to fly it?

01:09.136 --> 01:11.203
It's easy. Just sit up straight,

01:11.205 --> 01:12.704
then flick the reins...

01:12.706 --> 01:13.939
And yell, "Heeyah!"

01:13.941 --> 01:15.574
Okay, Saffron.

01:15.576 --> 01:16.875
Heeyah?

01:16.877 --> 01:17.943
( screaming )

01:17.945 --> 01:19.178
Oh!

01:19.180 --> 01:20.712
Oh! Oh...

01:20.714 --> 01:22.714
And boom goes Amber.

01:22.716 --> 01:24.583
Good try, Amber.

01:24.585 --> 01:27.252
You stayed on longer than I did
for my first time.

01:27.254 --> 01:29.621
No she didn't.
Ready to try again?

01:29.623 --> 01:31.690
Not if it involves
falling again.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.225
( ringing bell )

01:33.227 --> 01:35.727
Lunch is served
in the dining hall!

01:35.729 --> 01:38.597
Lunch already?
Oh, what a shame.

01:38.599 --> 01:41.100
Guess we'll have to finish
my riding lesson later.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.236
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

01:44.238 --> 01:45.737
Are you coming, Sofia?

01:45.739 --> 01:47.773
I'll be right there.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.341
It was nice of you
to come over and help

01:49.343 --> 01:51.143
with Amber's lesson,
Minimus.

01:51.145 --> 01:53.045
Anything for you, Sofia.

01:53.047 --> 01:54.646
( grunting )

01:54.648 --> 01:56.014
Need a scratch?

01:56.016 --> 01:58.283
Ah, yeah. Thank you.

01:58.285 --> 02:01.386
Oh! Ooh, I have terrible
wing-ear coordination.

02:01.388 --> 02:03.255
You're the best, Sofia.

02:03.257 --> 02:05.324
( giggles )
See you in a bit!

02:05.326 --> 02:07.292
Well, hey there,
short, light and purple!

02:07.294 --> 02:08.760
Whatcha doin' for lunch?

02:08.762 --> 02:10.696
I don't know.
Eating, probably.

02:10.698 --> 02:14.166
Well, what do you say
we grab some oats
and get acquainted?

02:14.168 --> 02:15.801
Are you sure
you're talking to me?

02:15.803 --> 02:17.269
SAFFRON: ( giggling )
You're funny!

02:17.271 --> 02:19.638
I'm Saffron.
What's your name?

02:19.640 --> 02:21.640
Oh, Minimus.
My name's Minimus.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.976
So what brings
a horse like you
to a stable like this?

02:23.978 --> 02:26.645
Maybe I don't need
to <i> ride </i> my new horse.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.214
I could just braid her tail
and feed her apples.

02:29.216 --> 02:31.049
Once you get
the hang of it, Amber,

02:31.051 --> 02:32.851
you're going
to love riding.

02:32.853 --> 02:35.420
When you and your horse
are soaring through the sky,

02:35.422 --> 02:38.824
just the two of you,
you form a special bond.

02:38.826 --> 02:42.361
Yeah. Sometimes Echo knows
which way I want to go
before I do!

02:42.363 --> 02:44.997
So what do you say, Amber?
Ready to go back out there?

02:44.999 --> 02:48.400
( groans ) All right.
I'll give it one more try.

02:53.306 --> 02:54.306
Minimus!

02:54.308 --> 02:55.707
Saffron!

02:55.709 --> 02:57.676
Echo!
Minimus!

02:57.678 --> 03:00.379
Minimus? Minimus?

03:00.381 --> 03:03.849
Hey! Echo's not
in his stall!
Neither is Saffron!

03:03.851 --> 03:06.318
BOY: The horses--
they've gone missing!
They're all gone!

03:06.320 --> 03:08.387
SOFIA:
Gone? What do you mean, gone?

03:08.389 --> 03:11.323
DRIVER: They broke free
of the carriage!

03:11.325 --> 03:13.859
The others
are gone too!
What's going on?

03:13.861 --> 03:16.295
All the flying horses
have taken off, Princess!

03:16.297 --> 03:17.462
What?
Why?

03:17.464 --> 03:19.464
Well, I don't know.
One second I heard

03:19.466 --> 03:21.733
strange music playing
in the distance,

03:21.735 --> 03:24.269
then the next second, bam!
They all flew off!

03:24.271 --> 03:26.471
We should tell
Constable Myles.

03:29.776 --> 03:32.744
So...only the flying horses
are gone?

03:32.746 --> 03:35.414
Yes, Constable.
Did you see
which way they went?

03:35.416 --> 03:38.417
They were heading southeast
fast as their wings
would take 'em!

03:38.419 --> 03:42.888
It's not like Minimus
to fly off like that,
Constable. I'm worried.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.856
Don't you fret, Princess Sofia.

03:44.858 --> 03:47.092
I'll lead the search party
myself.

03:47.094 --> 03:50.362
And we won't rest until
we find every last horse.

04:01.007 --> 04:03.508
( sighs ) I wish we could
go look for the horses too.

04:03.510 --> 04:05.143
Where would we go?

04:05.145 --> 04:06.445
We could start
with Sir Gilliam.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.313
He knows everything
about flying horses.

04:08.315 --> 04:10.182
Maybe he knows
where they went.

04:10.184 --> 04:13.352
Yeah, but we can't
get to Royal Prep
without flying horses.

04:13.354 --> 04:16.855
True.
Sofia, what you need
is a distraction,

04:16.857 --> 04:19.358
something to take your mind
off all this.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.260
Lets go to the Jewel Room!

04:21.262 --> 04:24.263
( gasps ) Amber!
That's a great idea!

04:24.265 --> 04:26.999
Of course it is. Jewelry
makes everything better.

04:27.001 --> 04:28.400
No, no, not the jewelry.

04:28.402 --> 04:30.469
The griffins
who <i> guard </i> the Jewel Room.

04:30.471 --> 04:32.337
They can fly us to Royal Prep!

04:32.339 --> 04:34.039
Brilliant!

04:34.041 --> 04:37.476
Wait. Are you suggesting
we ride...griffins?

04:37.478 --> 04:39.978
Yup. Stay here.
I'll get them.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.380
Princess Sofia?

04:41.382 --> 04:44.349
Hi! Hi!
So good to see you again!

04:44.351 --> 04:46.251
Rarrrr!

04:46.253 --> 04:48.787
Wow! Jasper,
you've gotten so big!

04:48.789 --> 04:51.189
Griffins grow <i> fast!</i>

04:51.191 --> 04:54.459
Look how big I am!

04:54.461 --> 04:56.828
Jasper! Slow down, honey!

04:56.830 --> 05:00.365
So what are you
doing here, Sofia?

05:00.367 --> 05:03.035
I need your help.
And your mom and dad, too.

05:03.037 --> 05:05.037
Cool! Let's go, go, go!

05:05.039 --> 05:06.938
FATHER: Hold up, Jasper.

05:06.940 --> 05:09.441
She hasn't even told us
what she needs yet.

05:09.443 --> 05:11.410
He's always
in such a hurry.

05:11.412 --> 05:12.944
Ah! Don't!

05:12.946 --> 05:15.180
( chuckles )
How can we help, Princess?

05:15.182 --> 05:16.348
Come with me.

05:18.217 --> 05:20.385
All right, you guys,
on to Royal Prep!

05:20.387 --> 05:22.354
Great.
I'll take the big one.

05:22.356 --> 05:24.489
Amber, you can ride Opal,
and I'll ride Jasper.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.525
Sofia, we don't
have to do this.

05:26.527 --> 05:29.061
The knights are already
searching for the horses.

05:29.063 --> 05:32.397
Minimus isn't just my horse--
he's my friend.

05:32.399 --> 05:34.399
I'll do whatever
it takes to find him.

05:34.401 --> 05:36.401
Aren't you worried
about Saffron?

05:36.403 --> 05:39.404
Of course I am. I really
want her to get home safely.

05:39.406 --> 05:41.340
But I don't know
how to ride a griffin!

05:41.342 --> 05:43.475
I'm sure it's a lot like
riding a flying horse.

05:43.477 --> 05:45.877
I don't know how to ride
a flying horse either!

05:45.879 --> 05:49.481
It's not hard. Just hop on
and hold on to the scruff.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.283
Like this. Okay?

05:51.285 --> 05:53.251
Uh...okay, I'll go.

05:53.253 --> 05:54.853
But just to Royal Prep.

05:56.456 --> 05:59.391
Ohh, I don't know about this.

05:59.393 --> 06:02.527
( sighs ) Nice griffin.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.629
( groaning )
Good griffin.

06:04.631 --> 06:06.631
So how we do take off again?

06:06.633 --> 06:09.634
All right,
let's go, go, go!

06:09.636 --> 06:11.436
AMBER: No, no, no!

06:11.438 --> 06:13.939
Whoa...!

06:13.941 --> 06:17.109
SOFIA: Come on, Amber,
now you're getting it!

06:17.111 --> 06:19.010
Let's go!
Go, go, go

06:19.012 --> 06:20.445
Aaaah!

06:20.447 --> 06:23.081
Oh! Thanks.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.317
Maybe I <i> can </i> fly this thing.

06:25.319 --> 06:26.318
No, I can't!

06:26.320 --> 06:28.253
Okay, follow us.

06:38.264 --> 06:39.931
We're there!

06:39.933 --> 06:42.501
Ohh, finally we can land!

06:42.503 --> 06:44.636
Actually,
landing is harder
than it looks.

06:44.638 --> 06:46.438
See ya down there!

06:49.509 --> 06:51.209
Oh, no!

06:57.250 --> 06:59.151
Ohh, how do you
steer this thing?!

06:59.153 --> 07:01.319
Ohh! No!

07:01.321 --> 07:02.421
Ohh!

07:06.092 --> 07:07.325
Sir Gilliam!

07:08.461 --> 07:11.029
Princess Sofia!
What are you doing here?

07:11.031 --> 07:12.364
Our horses went missing.

07:12.366 --> 07:14.266
So did ours!
What?

07:14.268 --> 07:17.102
Every horse in the stable
is gone.

07:19.505 --> 07:22.407
♪ ( ethereal music ) ♪
Where could they all be?

07:22.409 --> 07:25.110
Listen. Do you hear music?

07:25.112 --> 07:27.512
I do! But where
is it coming from?

07:27.514 --> 07:33.318
( gasps ) Maybe it's the same
music the coachmen heard
before our horses took off!

07:33.320 --> 07:35.387
I think you're right.
Look!

07:35.389 --> 07:38.723
♪ ( music continues ) ♪

07:38.725 --> 07:41.560
Whoa. They're all flying
in the same direction.

07:41.562 --> 07:44.262
Yeah, like they're
following the music!

07:44.264 --> 07:46.264
And I bet
wherever they're going,

07:46.266 --> 07:48.099
that's where <i> our </i> horses
went too!

07:48.101 --> 07:50.635
Let's follow them.
Good idea.

07:50.637 --> 07:54.005
No, it's not.
I am <i> not </i> getting
back on that thing!

07:54.007 --> 07:55.740
The only way
to learn how to fly

07:55.742 --> 07:57.342
is to keep
getting back on the horse.

07:57.344 --> 08:02.547
<i> Or </i> you could just <i> not </i>
learn how to fly.

08:02.549 --> 08:05.250
Amber, we don't have time
to argue about this.

08:05.252 --> 08:06.718
We're gonna
lose the horses.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.354
He's right.
We've got to hurry, Amber.

08:09.356 --> 08:12.557
Please!
Arrghh! <i> Fine.</i>

08:16.596 --> 08:17.729
All right.

08:17.731 --> 08:20.198
Heeyah!
Go, go, go!

08:21.367 --> 08:23.568
Please, don't let me fall again.

08:23.570 --> 08:25.537
Oh...!

08:25.539 --> 08:28.373
I should <i> not </i> have gotten
back on this griffin, Sofia!

08:28.375 --> 08:33.745
HORSES CHANTING:
Wendell is wonderful.
Wendell is wonderful...

08:33.747 --> 08:37.082
Excuse me!
Where are you all going?

08:37.084 --> 08:39.251
HORSES: Wendell is wonderful...

08:39.253 --> 08:41.086
Huh? Who's Wendell?

08:41.088 --> 08:44.556
Wendell is wonderful.
Wendell is wonderful...

08:44.558 --> 08:47.459
What?!
( Amber screaming )

08:47.461 --> 08:50.328
Amber!
She won't fly straight!

08:50.330 --> 08:52.797
<i> Yeah, </i> because you're
covering her eyes!

08:52.799 --> 08:54.466
Move your hands,
Amber!

08:54.468 --> 08:57.369
Ohh! Okay-- sorry. Sorry.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.604
I'll...grab the wings!

08:59.606 --> 09:02.741
Not her <i> wings! </i>
Grab her scruff!

09:04.610 --> 09:07.212
Right. Right.
The scruff.
I-I forgot.

09:11.183 --> 09:12.450
Good job, Amber.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.689
The horses just
flew into the clouds!

09:17.691 --> 09:21.326
We can still catch 'em.
Come on, let's go!

09:21.328 --> 09:23.328
Whoa!

09:23.330 --> 09:24.563
Can you see the horses?

09:26.332 --> 09:28.466
I can't see anything.

09:28.468 --> 09:31.336
Where'd they go?
I don't know.

09:31.338 --> 09:32.537
( Sofia groans )

09:34.106 --> 09:35.674
Where are the horses?

09:35.676 --> 09:38.610
We lost 'em. Thanks to <i> you.</i>

09:38.612 --> 09:43.481
Don't blame me!
I didn't even want
to come, remember?

09:43.483 --> 09:45.417
Well, maybe
you <i> shouldn't </i> have, Amber.

09:45.419 --> 09:47.185
James, stop it.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.354
Amber, you can go back
if you want.

09:49.356 --> 09:50.522
We should <i> all </i> go back.

09:50.524 --> 09:53.091
I can't.
I have to keep looking.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.326
Haven't we looked enough?

09:54.328 --> 09:56.394
No. I love Minimus,

09:56.396 --> 09:58.830
and I'm not going to stop
until he's all right.

09:58.832 --> 10:02.200
He really means
that much to you?

10:02.202 --> 10:03.501
He really does.

10:03.503 --> 10:06.271
Okay. But where would we
even look now?

10:06.273 --> 10:08.273
Uh...I don't know.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.575
I guess we could wait until
we hear that music again.

10:10.577 --> 10:13.511
Hey, look! There are
flying horses down there!

10:13.513 --> 10:16.715
All right, Opal, looks like
I need to learn how to fly.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.817
