00:28.100 --> 00:29.300
HEY, HEY, HEY!

00:29.300 --> 00:32.600
HEY, HE CAN'T TALK.
SHE'S GOT HIS TONGUE.

00:32.600 --> 00:35.600
HELLO!
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
MEETING NEW PEOPLE.

00:37.200 --> 00:38.500
I WANT TO MAKE OUT.

00:38.500 --> 00:41.300
OH, COME ON, ANGELA.
THIS IS OUR FRESHMAN
ORIENTATION.

00:41.300 --> 00:42.834
YOU KNOW,
THIS IS A NEW PLACE.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.300
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
MEETING NEW PEOPLE.

00:44.300 --> 00:46.200
YOU DON'T WANT TO
MAKE OUT WITH ME?

00:46.200 --> 00:48.200
NO, I ABSOLUTELY WANT
TO MAKE OUT, YOU KNOW.

00:48.200 --> 00:49.500
I JUST WANT TO MEET PEOPLE,

00:49.500 --> 00:54.300
AND I'VE NEVER MET ANYBODY
WHILE I'M MAKING OUT.

00:54.300 --> 00:57.667
EXCEPT FOR ONE NIGHT,
BUT THAT WAS A FLUKE.

00:59.734 --> 01:01.500
HI. I'M CAMRYN.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.200
HI, I'M SHAWN.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.400
AND THIS IS
MY FRIEND ANGELA.

01:05.400 --> 01:06.467
WHAT?

01:06.467 --> 01:07.700
WHAT?

01:07.700 --> 01:09.200
YOU SAID FRIEND.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.100
I DID?

01:11.100 --> 01:13.900
I MEANT, THIS IS
MY GIRLFRIEND ANGELA.

01:13.900 --> 01:15.100
MY GIRLFRIEND.

01:15.100 --> 01:16.900
OH, YOU TWO ARE TOGETHER.

01:16.900 --> 01:19.867
SHAWN?

01:19.867 --> 01:21.734
GIRLFRIEND AND BOYFRIEND.

01:21.734 --> 01:23.900
OH. WELL, SEE YOU
AROUND CAMPUS.

01:23.900 --> 01:25.967
ALL RIGHT. COOL.

01:32.734 --> 01:33.834
HOW YOU DOING?

01:33.834 --> 01:35.867
I'M GOOD, FRIEND.
HOW YOU DOING?

01:35.867 --> 01:39.867
OH, COME ON, ANGELA.
I MADE A MISTAKE.
I'M SORRY, OK?

01:39.867 --> 01:41.200
LET'S MAKE OUT.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.500
OH, IT'S OK.

01:42.500 --> 01:43.600
WE DON'T HAVE TO.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.867
WE CAN MEET
NEW PEOPLE.

01:45.867 --> 01:48.200
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS THAT
IMPORTANT TO YOU.

01:48.200 --> 01:50.300
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO MISS OUT
ON ANYTHING.

01:50.300 --> 01:51.567
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

01:51.567 --> 01:53.467
YOU WANT TO MEET
NEW PEOPLE,

01:53.467 --> 01:54.800
AND I'M
NOT NEW PEOPLE,

01:54.800 --> 01:56.800
SO WHAT DO YOU
WANT IT TO MEAN?

01:57.800 --> 01:58.734
Cory: WHOO!

01:58.734 --> 02:00.100
YOU KNOW,
WHOEVER THOUGHT UP
THESE ORIENTATIONS

02:00.100 --> 02:02.500
IS A GENIUS.

02:15.567 --> 02:17.667
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO GO IN THERE
SOMETIME.

02:19.867 --> 02:22.867
MEN AND WOMEN GOIN'
TO THE SAME BATHROOM.

02:22.867 --> 02:24.667
IT'S FREAKY!

02:25.734 --> 02:27.200
CORY, IT'S JUST
A CO-ED BATHROOM.

02:27.200 --> 02:28.300
COME ON,
COME IN WITH ME.

02:28.300 --> 02:29.600
NO! YOU'RE GOING
TO LOOK AT ME!

02:29.600 --> 02:30.900
I WON'T LOOK AT YOU!

02:30.900 --> 02:33.133
YOU DON'T WANT
TO LOOK AT ME?

02:33.133 --> 02:34.800
FINE. I'LL LOOK AT YOU.

02:34.800 --> 02:37.300
I KNEW IT!

02:37.300 --> 02:39.934
YOU HAVE ISSUES.

02:41.800 --> 02:42.800
HEY, HEY, HEY!

02:42.800 --> 02:44.767
WHERE YOU GOING,
SUNSHINE?

02:44.767 --> 02:47.400
I'M GOING
TO TAKE A SHOWER
AND MEET CHICKS.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.400
HEY!

02:48.400 --> 02:50.800
MY GIRLFRIEND'S
IN THERE.

02:50.800 --> 02:53.033
OK!

02:59.467 --> 03:02.200
Topanga: WOW!

03:08.667 --> 03:10.500
WOW.

03:11.567 --> 03:13.767
STILL CAN'T GO
IN THERE, HUH, COR?

03:13.767 --> 03:15.300
I'M TELLING YOU,
YOU MIGHT LIKE IT.

03:15.300 --> 03:17.500
I, FOR ONE,
CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT.

03:17.500 --> 03:19.200
GIRLS SHOWER IN THERE.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.000
<i>NEKKED. </i>

03:21.000 --> 03:22.900
SO WHAT DO YOU CARE
ABOUT NAKED GIRLS?

03:22.900 --> 03:24.300
YOU HAVE
YOUR OWN NAKED GIRL.

03:24.300 --> 03:26.600
I MEAN, SHE
HAS THE POTENTIAL
TO BE NAKED

03:26.600 --> 03:27.967
AT SOME POINT
IN HER CAREER.

03:27.967 --> 03:29.600
WELL, ACTUALLY,
NOT ANYMORE.

03:29.600 --> 03:32.467
ANGELA AND I DECIDED
TO TAKE A BREAK.

03:32.467 --> 03:33.467
YOU BROKE UP?

03:33.467 --> 03:35.467
YEAH. I GUESS
THAT'S WHAT WE DID.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.467
WHY?

03:38.467 --> 03:40.400
YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T
JUST MY IDEA. IT WAS
ANGELA'S, TOO.

03:40.400 --> 03:41.467
YEAH, BUT WHY?

03:41.467 --> 03:43.200
OK, AFTER THAT
ORIENTATION PARTY,

03:43.200 --> 03:44.500
WE TALKED
ABOUT ALL THE NEW
OPPORTUNITIES

03:44.500 --> 03:45.900
THAT ARE OPEN UP
TO US HERE,

03:45.900 --> 03:48.500
AND, YOU KNOW,
NEITHER ONE OF US
WANT TO MISS OUT.

03:48.500 --> 03:50.300
HEY, I GOT TO
TELL YOU, SHAWN,

03:50.300 --> 03:52.734
I THINK YOU'RE MAKING
A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.

03:52.734 --> 03:55.300
WE JUST WANT
TO SEE WHAT ELSE
IS OUT THERE.

03:55.300 --> 03:57.200
WHAT A BUNCH OF CRAP,
SHAWN. COME ON!

03:57.200 --> 04:00.066
YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S
NOTHING OUT THERE BETTER
THAN YOU AND HER.

04:00.066 --> 04:01.700
CORY, NOT EVERYBODY'S
LIKE YOU, YOU KNOW.

04:01.700 --> 04:04.667
NOT EVERYBODY SPENDS
THE REST OF THEIR LIFE
WITH ONE GIRLFRIEND.

04:04.667 --> 04:05.967
TOPANGA, DID YOU KNOW
THAT SHAWN...

04:05.967 --> 04:08.000
AND ANGELA BROKE UP?
YEAH. ANGELA TOLD ME.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.967
I THINK YOU GUYS
ARE BOTH HANDLING IT
WITH INCREDIBLE MATURITY.

04:10.967 --> 04:13.467
H-HOW IS BREAKING UP
MATURE?

04:13.467 --> 04:14.767
WORKING IT OUT
IS MATURE.

04:14.767 --> 04:16.834
STICKING TOGETHER
IS MATURE.

04:16.834 --> 04:18.834
CORY, NOT EVERY COUPLE
IS JUST LIKE US.

04:18.834 --> 04:21.300
YEAH, BUT I WANT
THEM TO BE LIKE US.

04:21.300 --> 04:23.000
I WANT THEM
TO BE HAPPY.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.500
ANGELA AND I AREN'T
GOING TO LET THIS
AFFECT OUR FRIENDSHIP,

04:25.500 --> 04:27.300
SO NEITHER SHOULD YOU.

04:27.300 --> 04:30.400
YOU GUYS ARE BOTH
MY FRIENDS NO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS, OK?

04:30.400 --> 04:32.200
COR?

04:32.200 --> 04:35.100
YEAH. Y-YOU'RE BOTH
MY FRIENDS.

04:35.100 --> 04:37.467
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS.

04:37.467 --> 04:39.900
AND I KNOW
YOU'LL BE TOGETHER
IN THE END.

04:42.500 --> 04:43.734
YEAH.

04:43.734 --> 04:45.600
YOU TRY AND TELL THE GUY
THAT SOMETHING'S OVER,

04:45.600 --> 04:48.934
AND HE JUST
WON'T LET IT GO.

04:54.600 --> 04:55.834
HEY, HEY,

04:55.834 --> 04:57.800
DOESN'T
THAT GUY BEHIND ME
LOOK LIKE MR. FEENY?

04:57.800 --> 04:59.300
OH, DON'T EVEN!

04:59.300 --> 05:02.867
FEENY MOVED TO WYOMING,
OK? I HAVE CLOSED
THAT CHAPTER IN MY LIFE,

05:02.867 --> 05:04.000
AND I'VE OPENED UP
A NEW ONE.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.200
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
I CALL THAT CHAPTER,
JACK?

05:06.200 --> 05:08.600
CHAPTER 5.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.300
NO, NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK HE'S RIGHT.

05:10.300 --> 05:11.800
HE DOES LOOK
LIKE THE GUY

05:11.800 --> 05:14.467
IN THE POSTER
BY YOUR BED.

05:15.867 --> 05:16.967
HOW YOU DOING?

05:16.967 --> 05:20.233
YOU THINK THAT
THAT KID'S FEENY?

05:20.233 --> 05:22.600
YEAH.
I'M PRETTY SURE.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.000
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S TEST HIM.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.567
I'M GOING TO ASK HIM
A QUESTION

05:25.567 --> 05:28.500
THAT ONLY FEENY
WOULD KNOW THE ANSWER TO.

05:29.567 --> 05:31.100
ARE YOU GEORGE FEENY?

05:33.033 --> 05:35.500
IT'S ME, YOU MORON.

05:35.500 --> 05:36.600
CORRECT! HEY!

05:36.600 --> 05:39.600
MR. FEENY, YOU COULDN'T
STAY AWAY FROM ME!

05:39.600 --> 05:42.033
HELLO, MR. MATTHEWS.
HELLO, MR. HUNTER.

05:42.033 --> 05:43.100
HOW YOU DOING?

05:43.100 --> 05:44.100
AND MS., UH...

05:44.100 --> 05:45.400
McGUIRE. RACHEL.
GEORGE FEENY.

05:45.400 --> 05:46.400
OH, IT'S SO NICE
TO MEET YOU.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.100
ERIC TALKS ABOUT YOU
ALL THE TIME.

05:48.100 --> 05:50.233
IT'S SUCH A PLEASURE
TO FINALLY MEET

05:50.233 --> 05:52.000
ERIC'S GRANDPA.

05:54.400 --> 05:55.667
YOUR WHAT?

05:55.667 --> 05:58.100
MAYBE SOMEDAY.

06:00.367 --> 06:02.233
SO, MR. FEENY, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

06:02.233 --> 06:03.867
I MEAN, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE RETIRED.

06:03.867 --> 06:05.300
NO, HE COULDN'T
STAY AWAY FROM ME.

06:05.300 --> 06:08.033
HE'S CONVENIENTLY
COME BACK TO TEACH
THIS CLASS.

06:08.033 --> 06:10.367
ACTUALLY, I CAME BACK
TO BE A STUDENT.

06:10.367 --> 06:12.567
WHAT, SO YOU'RE
NOT RETIRED ANYMORE?

06:12.567 --> 06:14.600
RETIRED LIFE
DIDN'T TURN OUT TO BE

06:14.600 --> 06:17.133
WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR,
MR. MATTHEWS.

06:17.133 --> 06:18.300
HELLO, EVERYBODY.

06:18.300 --> 06:21.100
WELCOME TO
DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY.

06:21.100 --> 06:23.467
I'M DEAN BOLANDER.

06:23.467 --> 06:24.867
I'VE HAD A ROTTEN MORNING,

06:24.867 --> 06:27.000
AND I DON'T CHECK
MY MOOD AT THE DOOR.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.567
OH, MY.

06:29.567 --> 06:30.867
DOWN, BOY.

06:30.867 --> 06:32.100
OUR FIRST
GROUP PROJECT

06:32.100 --> 06:35.600
WILL BE AN EXPLORATION
OF HUMAN NATURE.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.867
IS A PERSON ABLE
TO ALTER A TRAIT

06:37.867 --> 06:41.300
INGRAINED IN
HIS BEHAVIORAL MAKEUP
SINCE CHILDHOOD?

06:41.300 --> 06:45.100
NOW, FOR THIS STUDY,
YOU WILL EACH NEED
TO CHOOSE A PARTNER.

06:45.100 --> 06:47.000
I CALL JACK!

06:48.100 --> 06:49.500
WH-WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

06:49.500 --> 06:51.133
I KNEW YOU'D ASK RACHEL
TO BE YOUR PARTNER,

06:51.133 --> 06:53.767
SO I GOT YOU
BEFORE YOU COULD
GET TO HER.

06:54.834 --> 06:56.500
WANT TO BE PARTNERS,
MR. FEENY?

06:56.500 --> 06:57.934
DELIGHTED, MS. McGUIRE.

06:57.934 --> 06:59.700
WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST ASK RACHEL

06:59.700 --> 07:01.800
BEFORE I GOT
THE CHANCE?

07:02.867 --> 07:03.934
IT'S HARD TO SAY.

07:03.934 --> 07:05.834
YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF CONTROL

07:05.834 --> 07:08.800
OVER WHAT GOES ON
UP HERE.

07:11.700 --> 07:13.367
OH! A RUBBER BAND.

07:13.367 --> 07:15.667
NEAT-O!

07:17.367 --> 07:19.600
OH, THIS IS A GOOD ONE.

07:20.667 --> 07:21.834
WHO ARE YOU?

07:21.834 --> 07:23.800
CORY,
THIS IS CAMRYN.

07:23.800 --> 07:26.300
CAMRYN, THIS IS
MY ROOMMATE CORY,

07:26.300 --> 07:28.133
THE RUBBER BAND MAN.

07:28.133 --> 07:29.133
HI.

07:29.133 --> 07:30.500
HELLO.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.800
YOU KNOW,
THAT RUBBER BAND
WAS ON THE DOOR

07:32.800 --> 07:34.734
FOR A REASON, COR.

07:34.734 --> 07:37.734
HA! A LITTLE PRESENT
FOR ME?

07:40.200 --> 07:41.734
EXCUSE US.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.600
OK, IF THERE'S
A RUBBER BAND
ON THE DOOR,

07:48.600 --> 07:50.967
IT MEANS THE ROOM
IS <i>OCUPADO.  </i>
YOU GET IT?

07:50.967 --> 07:53.367
SHAWN, HOW CAN YOU BE
WITH ANOTHER GIRL SO SOON?

07:53.367 --> 07:54.567
I MEAN,
SHOULDN'T THERE BE

07:54.567 --> 07:55.800
A MORE SUITABLE
MOURNING PERIOD?

07:55.800 --> 07:58.100
NOBODY DIED, CORY.
ANGELA AND I BROKE UP.

07:58.100 --> 07:59.900
SHE'S FINE WITH IT,
AND I'M FINE WITH IT,

07:59.900 --> 08:01.867
SO WHY DON'T YOU PUT
THAT BACK ON THE DOOR

08:01.867 --> 08:03.300
AND GIT!

08:07.500 --> 08:09.033
HEY, COR.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:09.033 --> 08:11.300
WHAT IS THAT,
A RUBBER BAND?

08:11.300 --> 08:12.300
IT'S MINE.
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO

08:12.300 --> 08:14.100
WITH WHAT'S
BEHIND THE DOOR.

08:14.100 --> 08:15.667
SHAWN GOT A GIRL
IN THERE?

08:15.667 --> 08:18.100
HA! DON'T BE SILLY,
ANGELA.

08:18.100 --> 08:20.700
I WAS JUST
EXERCISING.

08:23.667 --> 08:26.033
WUFF! FEEL THE BURN!

08:27.100 --> 08:29.100
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT, CORY.

08:29.100 --> 08:32.700
THANKS, BUT
I WASN'T JUST BORN
WITH THIS BODY.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
I AM OK WITH IT
IF SHAWN HAS A GIRL
IN THERE.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.567
YEAH. HE SAID
YOU WOULD BE.

08:39.567 --> 08:40.700
HE DID?

08:40.700 --> 08:41.900
YEAH, WELL, IT'S NONE
OF MY BUSINESS ANYWAY.

08:41.900 --> 08:42.967
WHY SHOULD I CARE?

08:42.967 --> 08:44.400
BECAUSE
YOU SHOULD CARE.
LISTEN, ANGELA,

08:44.400 --> 08:47.467
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU CAN BOTH BE
SO CALM ABOUT THIS.

08:47.467 --> 08:49.300
OH, DROP IT, CORY.
I'M FINE.

08:49.300 --> 08:51.734
BECAUSE IF IT'S
BOTHERING YOU, YOU
SHOULD REALLY TELL ME.

08:51.734 --> 08:54.367
THERE'S NOTHING
TO TELL, OK?

08:54.367 --> 08:57.400
I MEAN, IT'S NOT
BOTHERING ME, SO WHY
SHOULD IT BOTHER YOU?

08:57.400 --> 08:59.300
I'M JUST TRYING
TO BE A FRIEND.

08:59.300 --> 09:00.500
YEAH, WELL,
I APPRECIATE IT, CORY,

09:00.500 --> 09:01.500
BUT LET'S NOT KID
OURSELVES.

09:01.500 --> 09:04.500
YOU AND I WERE
NEVER REALLY FRIENDS
TO BEGIN WITH.

09:07.834 --> 09:09.934
WHAT?

09:14.200 --> 09:15.734
HOW CAN SHE NOT LIKE ME?

09:15.734 --> 09:21.100
HOW CAN SHE SAY
I'M NOT HER FRIEND?
I'M CORY!

09:21.100 --> 09:22.834
CORY, YOU KNOW
ANGELA LIKES YOU.

09:22.834 --> 09:24.500
SHE JUST
DOESN'T REALLY
KNOW YOU WELL.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.000
I MEAN, YOU HAVE
TO ADMIT YOU NEVER
TOOK THE TIME

09:26.000 --> 09:27.100
TO GET TO KNOW HER.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.500
TOPANGA, WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

09:28.500 --> 09:30.600
I MEAN,
SHE'S BEEN GOING OUT
WITH MY BEST FRIEND

09:30.600 --> 09:31.667
FOR OVER A YEAR!

09:31.667 --> 09:33.300
WHEN THE 4 OF US
WENT OUT,
HOW MANY TIMES

09:33.300 --> 09:34.900
DID YOU
PULL HER ASIDE
AND TALK TO HER?

09:34.900 --> 09:36.300
800 TIMES.

09:36.300 --> 09:37.667
NOT ONCE, CORY.

09:37.667 --> 09:40.667
YOU NEVER
TOOK THE TIME TO
GET TO KNOW HER.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.500
WELL, YOU KNOW,
SHE NEVER TOOK ME
ASIDE EITHER.

09:42.500 --> 09:43.500
WELL,
THEN LET IT GO.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.767
OH, WHEN DO I EVER
LET ANYTHING GO?

09:46.767 --> 09:49.867
WE HAVE THE ROOM
TO OURSELVES.

10:01.967 --> 10:03.934
WHAT?

10:03.934 --> 10:06.667
HOW CAN SHE NOT LIKE ME?

10:14.133 --> 10:16.300
GOOD MORNING, CLASS.

10:17.567 --> 10:19.767
CLASS?

10:19.767 --> 10:20.767
CLASS.

10:20.767 --> 10:23.567
EVERYBODY PIPE DOWN!

10:24.600 --> 10:25.600
THEY'RE ALL YOURS.

10:25.600 --> 10:28.300
YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE,
GEORGE.

10:28.300 --> 10:31.200
SHE KNOWS MY NAME.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.500
ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE
WHAT YOU GOT.

10:32.500 --> 10:35.500
ANY BRAVE VOLUNTEERS
TO START US OFF?

10:36.567 --> 10:37.600
[WHISPERING]
What are you doing?

10:37.600 --> 10:40.200
Trust me. Teachers
love the firsters.

10:40.200 --> 10:43.767
Dean Bolander
will be very impressed
with our initiative,

10:43.767 --> 10:46.734
and we will set
an impossible standard

10:46.734 --> 10:48.934
for the rest of the class.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.834
GEORGE AND RACHEL.
LET'S HEAR IT.

10:51.834 --> 10:54.100
NO, I CAN'T GO
FIRST. I DON'T LIKE
FIRST. I CAN'T.

10:54.100 --> 10:55.400
WE HAVE
A GREAT PRESENTATION.

10:55.400 --> 10:56.734
NOW, YOU CAN DO IT.
COME ON.

10:56.734 --> 10:58.900
YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
DEAN, IF THESE 2
AREN'T READY,

10:58.900 --> 11:02.033
I THINK JACK
AND I ARE READY
TO PROVE THAT--

11:02.033 --> 11:04.000
WHAT WAS OUR THING?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.367
WELL, HERE WE ARE,
RIGHT?

11:06.367 --> 11:08.033
AND YOU'RE FINE.

11:08.033 --> 11:09.500
SO GO AHEAD.

11:09.500 --> 11:12.667
YOU DO IT. YOU. YOU.

11:14.133 --> 11:16.700
UH, IT IS
OUR POSTULATION

11:16.700 --> 11:18.800
THAT, UH, FREE WILL

11:18.800 --> 11:20.767
DETERMINES BEHAVIOR

11:20.767 --> 11:23.734
AND NOT
ONE'S ENVIRONMENT.

11:23.734 --> 11:24.767
RACHEL?

11:24.767 --> 11:25.900
UH...

11:25.900 --> 11:27.700
AND WE WILL PROVE...

11:27.700 --> 11:30.867
AND, UH, WE'RE
GOING TO PROVE THAT--

11:30.867 --> 11:34.200
OH, I'M SO NERVOUS,
MR. FEENY.

11:34.200 --> 11:38.200
UH, WE WILL PROVE
THAT STRENGTH
OF CHARACTER

11:38.200 --> 11:39.734
IS THE PREDOMINANT
FORCE.

11:39.734 --> 11:41.000
FOR EXAMPLE,

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
IF A REFORMED
CRIMINAL

11:43.000 --> 11:45.133
RETURNS TO
HIS OLD NEIGHBORHOOD,

11:45.133 --> 11:48.867
DOES THAT MEAN
THAT HE WILL NECESSARILY

11:48.867 --> 11:51.800
RETURN TO A LIFE OF CRIME?

11:51.800 --> 11:53.200
ANYONE?

11:54.600 --> 11:55.934
MR. HUNTER.

11:55.934 --> 11:56.967
UM, NO.

11:56.967 --> 11:58.667
NO, NOT IF
HE'S DETERMINED
NOT TO.

11:58.667 --> 12:00.200
VERY GOOD, MR. HUNTER.

12:00.200 --> 12:04.300
VERY GOOD,
MR. SUCK-UP-TO-THE-TEACHER.

12:04.300 --> 12:05.467
HE'S NOT
THE TEACHER.

12:05.467 --> 12:08.300
WELL, THEN WHY
DID YOU ANSWER HIM?

12:08.300 --> 12:10.600
HIS WILL
IS TOO STRONG.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.000
SO, GEORGE,
YOU'RE SUGGESTING

12:12.000 --> 12:15.867
THAT ENVIRONMENT HAS
NO EFFECT ON BEHAVIOR?

12:15.867 --> 12:18.500
THERE WILL BE
AMPLE TIME
FOR QUESTIONS

12:18.500 --> 12:20.934
AFTER
MY PRESENTATION.

12:20.934 --> 12:24.233
AND A HAND RAISE
WOULDN'T KILL YOU.

12:25.900 --> 12:27.467
EXCUSE ME?

12:28.500 --> 12:30.000
OH, MY GOODNESS.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.200
UH, DEAN BOLANDER,

12:31.200 --> 12:33.033
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT GOT INTO ME.

12:33.033 --> 12:34.033
I APOLOGIZE.

12:34.033 --> 12:37.100
UH, RACHEL, WOULD
YOU PLEASE CONTINUE

12:37.100 --> 12:39.233
WITH OUR THESIS?

12:39.233 --> 12:40.500
I CAN'T.

12:40.500 --> 12:41.600
YES, YOU CAN!

12:41.600 --> 12:42.600
YOU'RE
AN EXCELLENT STUDENT

12:42.600 --> 12:43.900
AND
VERY WELL-PREPARED.

12:43.900 --> 12:48.400
NO, NO. I MEAN,
I CAN'T CONTINUE
WITH OUR THEORY.

12:48.400 --> 12:52.133
BUT I THINK I CAN DO
THE PRESENTATION NOW.

12:52.133 --> 12:54.867
SEE, AS MY PARTNER
DEMONSTRATED,

12:54.867 --> 12:56.700
OUR THEORY
WAS ALL WRONG.

12:56.700 --> 12:58.900
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

12:58.900 --> 13:01.834
ENVIRONMENT OBVIOUSLY
HAS A STRONGER EFFECT
ON BEHAVIOR

13:01.834 --> 13:04.033
THAN WE REALIZED.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.300
BUT YOU'RE
NOT NERVOUS NOW.

13:05.300 --> 13:07.767
YOU HAVE OVERCOME
YOUR ENVIRONMENT.

13:07.767 --> 13:10.667
YEAH, BUT YOU HAVEN'T.

13:22.767 --> 13:24.200
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

13:24.200 --> 13:25.467
COME IN.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.667
HEY, ANGELA.

13:28.667 --> 13:29.667
OH, LOOK.

13:29.667 --> 13:32.033
I SEE YOU GOT
MY FLOWERS.

13:32.033 --> 13:33.400
BUT, UH,

13:33.400 --> 13:36.667
WHO--WHO SENT YOU
THESE BALLOONS?

13:36.667 --> 13:38.767
OH, LOOK, I DID.

13:38.767 --> 13:41.834
"FROM YOUR FRIEND
CORY."

13:41.834 --> 13:44.800
CORY, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO SEND ME ANYTHING.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.967
WELL, IT'S TOO LATE.

13:46.967 --> 13:48.900
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:48.900 --> 13:50.200
TRYING TO STUDY.

13:50.200 --> 13:53.233
HEY, YOU REMEMBER
WHEN WE STUDIED FOR
THAT TEST TOGETHER

13:53.233 --> 13:54.600
THAT ONE TIME, HUH?

13:54.600 --> 13:55.700
WASN'T THAT
SOMETHING?

13:55.700 --> 13:57.934
WE NEVER STUDIED
FOR ANYTHING TOGETHER.

13:57.934 --> 14:00.700
YEAH, BUT
WE DID OTHER STUFF
TOGETHER, RIGHT?

14:00.700 --> 14:02.400
LIKE WHAT?

14:02.400 --> 14:03.867
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
DIDN'T WE FIND OUT

14:03.867 --> 14:07.300
HOW STELLA
GOT HER GROOVE BACK
TOGETHER?

14:08.367 --> 14:10.367
YOU ARE SO DOWN,
MY BROTHER.

14:10.367 --> 14:12.100
ANGELA, LISTEN,
I WANT YOU TO KNOW

14:12.100 --> 14:14.467
THAT YOUR FRIENDSHIP
IS REALLY IMPORTANT
TO ME.

14:14.467 --> 14:17.100
NO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS BETWEEN
YOU AND SHAWN.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.567
WHERE YOU GOING?

14:24.567 --> 14:27.033
I'M GOING TO GO
TAKE A SHOWER.

14:28.934 --> 14:31.500
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO
TAKE A SHOWER NOW?

14:31.500 --> 14:33.000
BECAUSE
IT'S THE ONE PLACE

14:33.000 --> 14:35.600
I KNOW
YOU WON'T FOLLOW ME.

14:49.500 --> 14:50.834
ANGELA?

14:52.033 --> 14:54.133
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SCARED
TO DEATH OF THIS PLACE?

14:54.133 --> 14:56.600
I'M MORE SCARED
OF LOSING YOU.

14:56.600 --> 14:59.133
[SIGHS] OH, MAN...

15:05.133 --> 15:07.300
OK, WHAT DO YOU
WANT WITH ME?

15:07.300 --> 15:08.400
I WANT TO KNOW

15:08.400 --> 15:10.100
WHY YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE FRIENDS
WITH ME.

15:10.100 --> 15:13.467
I MEAN, DON'T YOU
THINK THAT I'M WORTH
BEING FRIENDS WITH?

15:13.467 --> 15:17.033
CORY,
THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

15:17.033 --> 15:18.033
OH, IT'S SHAWN,
RIGHT?

15:18.033 --> 15:20.133
JUST BECAUSE YOU
BROKE UP WITH SHAWN

15:20.133 --> 15:22.033
DOESN'T MEAN THAT
WE CAN'T BE FRIENDS.

15:22.033 --> 15:24.600
I DIDN'T BREAK UP
WITH SHAWN.

15:24.600 --> 15:26.667
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

15:26.667 --> 15:30.667
HE BROKE UP WITH ME.
CAN I GET BACK
TO MY SHOWER NOW?

15:30.667 --> 15:32.867
WAIT A MINUTE.
H-HOLD ON. STOP!

15:32.867 --> 15:36.300
WHAT--WHAT DO YOU
MEAN HE BROKE UP
WITH YOU?

15:36.300 --> 15:39.400
HE THINKS
IT'S MUTUAL.

15:39.400 --> 15:41.100
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
I WANT HIM TO THINK.

15:41.100 --> 15:44.400
LOOK, PLEASE DON'T
ASK ME ABOUT THIS.

15:48.200 --> 15:49.400
WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST TELL HIM

15:49.400 --> 15:50.900
THAT YOU DON'T WANT
TO BREAK UP WITH HIM
THEN?

15:50.900 --> 15:52.300
OH, YEAH, THAT'S
EVERY GIRL'S DREAM,

15:52.300 --> 15:54.033
TO BEG SOMEBODY
TO STAY WITH HER.

15:54.033 --> 15:56.300
LOOK, HE NEEDS
HIS SPACE.

15:56.300 --> 15:58.400
HE WANTS TO MEET
NEW PEOPLE.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.300
NO. NO, HE'S WRONG.

16:00.300 --> 16:02.767
COME ON, YOU KNOW
HE'S NEVER GOING
TO FIND ANYBODY

16:02.767 --> 16:05.400
AS GOOD AS YOU.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.834
YOU DON'T
EVEN KNOW ME.

16:07.834 --> 16:10.200
FINE. YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:10.200 --> 16:11.500
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.

16:11.500 --> 16:15.233
THEN WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE ME A CHANCE
TO KNOW YOU?

16:15.233 --> 16:16.867
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
SHAWN'S RIGHT.

16:16.867 --> 16:18.367
WE'VE ALL BEEN TOGETHER
SO LONG...

16:18.367 --> 16:20.100
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST
TIME FOR US TO--

16:20.100 --> 16:21.133
SHUT UP.

16:21.133 --> 16:22.400
WHAT?

16:22.400 --> 16:23.400
SHUT UP.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.600
YOU COULDN'T BE
MORE WRONG.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.934
FRIENDSHIP
IS EXACTLY WHAT'S
GOING TO GET US

16:26.934 --> 16:28.467
ALL THROUGH THIS.

16:28.467 --> 16:29.600
CORY--

16:29.600 --> 16:30.867
AND I AM NEVER

16:30.867 --> 16:33.033
GOING TO GO AWAY.

16:36.367 --> 16:39.500
YOU JUST DON'T
GET IT, DO YOU?

16:40.967 --> 16:43.834
IT'S HARD ENOUGH
BEING IN THE SAME SCHOOL
WITH HIM.

16:43.834 --> 16:46.367
IN THE SAME CLASS
WITH HIM.

16:47.400 --> 16:49.100
AND JUST WHEN
I GET A MOMENT

16:49.100 --> 16:50.500
WHERE I'M NOT THINKING
ABOUT HIM,

16:50.500 --> 16:54.000
YOU WANT TO
COME OUT AND PLAY?

16:54.000 --> 16:56.500
HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME
TO HANG OUT WITH YOU

16:56.500 --> 16:57.500
AND NOT THINK
ABOUT HIM?

16:57.500 --> 16:59.600
BECAUSE I'M NOT SHAWN.

16:59.600 --> 17:00.934
I'M ME.

17:00.934 --> 17:03.367
AND I KNOW THAT
IF YOU JUST LET ME
BE FRIENDS WITH YOU,

17:03.367 --> 17:06.767
I PROMISE I CAN MAKE
THINGS BETTER FOR YOU.

17:07.834 --> 17:09.700
YOU WANT TO BE
MY FRIEND?

17:09.700 --> 17:11.000
YEAH.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
AND YOU'RE GOING
TO KEEP TO YOURSELF

17:13.000 --> 17:14.934
HOW I FEEL
ABOUT HIM?

17:14.934 --> 17:17.233
YEAH.

17:17.233 --> 17:19.800
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT
HIM TO STOP LOOKING
FOR WHO HE IS

17:19.800 --> 17:23.700
BECAUSE HE FEELS
SORRY FOR ME. OK?

17:23.700 --> 17:24.967
SO YOU PROMISE ME

17:24.967 --> 17:26.734
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS EVER.

17:26.734 --> 17:29.400
I WON'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS.

17:30.834 --> 17:33.200
TO ANYBODY?

17:33.200 --> 17:35.500
CAN I TALK ABOUT IT
WITH TOPANGA?

17:35.500 --> 17:37.200
TOPANGA
DOESN'T KNOW.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.500
WHY NOT?

17:38.500 --> 17:41.033
'CAUSE
I HAVEN'T TOLD HER.

17:42.100 --> 17:43.467
SHE'S YOUR BEST FRIEND.

17:43.467 --> 17:45.100
RIGHT.

17:46.200 --> 17:47.667
AND YOU HAVEN'T
TOLD HER?

17:48.734 --> 17:51.300
RIGHT.

17:51.300 --> 17:53.834
BUT YOU TOLD ME.

17:56.834 --> 17:59.200
THANKS.

17:59.200 --> 18:02.800
IT'LL JUST BE A SECRET
BETWEEN FRIENDS.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.400
COME HERE.

18:08.967 --> 18:10.700
SO, IN CONCLUSION,

18:10.700 --> 18:12.000
WATCHES,

18:12.000 --> 18:13.567
CHOCOLATE,

18:13.567 --> 18:14.900
CHEESE.

18:14.900 --> 18:17.300
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
WE GIVE YOU THE SWISS.

18:17.300 --> 18:19.834
THANK YOU.

18:19.834 --> 18:22.567
ERIC,
WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO PROVE SOMETHING.

18:22.567 --> 18:24.200
HE DID.

18:25.300 --> 18:26.567
OK, FOLKS, I THINK

18:26.567 --> 18:29.400
THAT'S ABOUT ALL
WE CAN TAKE TODAY.

18:29.400 --> 18:32.133
I'LL SEE YOU ALL
ON THURSDAY.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.200
UH, I AM SO SORRY.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.367
I BET YOU HAVE

18:35.367 --> 18:38.100
A REALLY STRONG
FIRST IMPRESSION
OF US, HUH?

18:38.100 --> 18:39.500
INDELIBLE.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.867
YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
DEAN? THIS DIDN'T
ALL COME FROM ME.

18:41.867 --> 18:45.100
MY BOY JACKIE HERE
DESERVES
THE SAME GRADE I DO.

18:45.100 --> 18:47.400
DONE.

18:48.600 --> 18:49.600
GEORGE.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.734
GEORGE, MAY I HAVE A WORD?

18:51.734 --> 18:53.300
YOU WANT ME TO
STAY AFTER SCHOOL.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.233
NO, NO,
NOTHING SO SEVERE.

18:55.233 --> 18:57.300
THAT WAS, UM,

18:57.300 --> 18:59.200
THAT WAS QUITE
A PRESENTATION.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.400
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT GOT INTO ME.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.300
WELL, I THINK
WHAT GOT INTO YOU

19:01.300 --> 19:04.033
WAS SOMETHING THAT
NEVER REALLY LEFT YOU.

19:04.033 --> 19:07.033
I INTENDED TO
COME HERE STRICTLY
AS A STUDENT.

19:07.033 --> 19:09.467
I THOUGHT
I HAD RETIRED
FROM TEACHING.

19:09.467 --> 19:12.133
YES. WELL, WHEN
I STOPPED TEACHING
TO BECOME DEAN,

19:12.133 --> 19:13.200
I THOUGHT
THE SAME THING,

19:13.200 --> 19:15.233
BUT HERE I AM.

19:15.233 --> 19:16.400
WE'RE TEACHERS,
GEORGE.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.567
YOU PUT US
IN A CLASSROOM,
WE TEACH.

19:18.567 --> 19:20.100
YES, WELL, AFTER
ALL THESE YEARS,

19:20.100 --> 19:23.567
I STILL HAVE
A LOT TO LEARN.

19:23.567 --> 19:25.200
I'M SORRY, RACHEL.

19:25.200 --> 19:27.000
I GUESS
I WAS A POOR CHOICE

19:27.000 --> 19:29.400
FOR A PARTNER.

19:29.400 --> 19:30.400
NO.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.100
I GOT TO ADMIT,
I'D MUCH RATHER

19:32.100 --> 19:33.100
HAVE YOU
AS A TEACHER

19:33.100 --> 19:34.400
THAN AS A PARTNER.

19:34.400 --> 19:37.133
I'D RATHER HAVE HIM
AS A COLLEAGUE
THAN A STUDENT.

19:37.133 --> 19:39.867
PERHAPS YOU'D CARE
TO CALL MY OFFICE
ABOUT THAT.

19:39.867 --> 19:42.100
WELL, YOU HAVE
MY GRATITUDE,
DEAN BOLANDER.

19:42.100 --> 19:44.100

TO YOUR CALL.

20:04.100 --> 20:06.233
[HISSING, SPITTING]

20:10.567 --> 20:12.600
DUDE, LET'S GO.

20:33.867 --> 20:36.233
CORY, I'M REALLY GLAD
THAT YOU'VE GOTTEN OVER
YOUR FEAR OF THE BATHROOM,

20:36.233 --> 20:37.667
BUT THAT'S
YOUR FIFTH SHOWER TODAY.

20:37.667 --> 20:40.500
HA! I'M
THE CLEANEST BOY
IN SCHOOL.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.767
SO, YOU KNOW THAT GUY TIM
IN OUR ECON CLASS?

20:42.767 --> 20:45.500
I WAS THINKING MAYBE
HE AND ANGELA COULD...

20:45.500 --> 20:46.934
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

20:46.934 --> 20:48.233
NO! HE'S NOT RIGHT
FOR...

20:48.233 --> 20:50.900
I--I MEAN, SHE'S
NOT RIGHT FOR HIM.

20:50.900 --> 20:52.667
I MEAN, I DON'T
THINK WE SHOULD BE

20:52.667 --> 20:55.367
SETTING UP ANGELA
SO QUICKLY.

20:55.367 --> 20:59.000
HEY, CORY, WHAT, DO YOU,
LIKE, LIVE HERE NOW?

20:59.000 --> 21:00.133
NO, NO.

21:00.133 --> 21:01.900
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS SO AFRAID OF.

21:01.900 --> 21:04.900
THESE CO-ED BATHROOMS
ARE A SENSATIONAL CONCEPT.

21:04.900 --> 21:06.667
YEAH. JUST THINK,
IF THESE THINGS CATCH ON,

21:06.667 --> 21:09.100
THEY'LL BE PUTTING THEM
IN PEOPLE'S HOMES.

21:09.100 --> 21:11.033
WHAT A TERRIFIC IDEA!

21:12.100 --> 21:13.400
HEY, GUYS.

21:13.400 --> 21:14.500
HEY, ANGELA.

21:14.500 --> 21:15.900
HEY.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.700
SO, CORY,

21:20.700 --> 21:22.400
WHAT'S UP?

21:24.867 --> 21:25.967
NOTHING.
