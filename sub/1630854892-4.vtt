WEBVTT

00:07.341 --> 00:10.553
Unfortunately, Mr. Sang cannot
be with us today.

00:10.553 --> 00:14.640
You'll find this illustrates
Mr. Sang's wishes.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.434
So, you're saying this guy
just waltzed in

00:16.434 --> 00:19.437
off the street one day and got
Sang to sign over

00:19.437 --> 00:21.063
complete authority?
I don't buy it.

00:21.063 --> 00:22.982
My friend Milani
has been struggling

00:22.982 --> 00:24.775
with substance abuse
for many years.

00:27.820 --> 00:29.488
What's happening to me?

00:29.488 --> 00:32.408
You're having
a panic attack, Craig.

00:32.408 --> 00:33.826
We work for a sociopath.

00:33.826 --> 00:36.287
- You lied to me.
- I had to know

00:36.287 --> 00:38.456
- if we truly can be friends.
- And?

00:38.456 --> 00:42.001
Let's just say I won't
be relying on you in a crisis.

00:45.838 --> 00:48.924
Frank Florez. If you want
to know what he's made of,

00:48.924 --> 00:50.384
find Frank Florez.

01:21.791 --> 01:22.792
Hi.

01:22.792 --> 01:24.585
Mr. Sang-woo, please.

01:24.585 --> 01:28.047
- Do you have an appointment?
- I do not.

01:28.047 --> 01:30.049
So, Sang has this policy

01:30.049 --> 01:33.594
where he can't see anybody
without an appointment.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.179
Mr. Sang-woo, please.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.850
Like I was saying,

01:39.850 --> 01:42.019
I could schedule you
an appointment.

01:42.019 --> 01:44.188
I'll wait
until he becomes available.

02:45.207 --> 02:48.752
Sir? Hi. Yeah. He said he can
give you 10 minutes.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.445
Yes, yes.

03:17.114 --> 03:20.159
Good afternoon,
Mr. Sang. My name is--

03:20.159 --> 03:22.703
English.
I speak perfect English.

03:24.330 --> 03:27.374
My name
is Regus Patoff,

03:27.374 --> 03:29.418
and I've travelled
a very long way

03:29.418 --> 03:31.545
to offer you a gift.

03:31.545 --> 03:36.091
You can leave it with
my assistant on your way out.

03:36.091 --> 03:40.596
Unfortunately,
this gift won't arrive

03:40.596 --> 03:42.598
until after you're dead.

03:42.598 --> 03:45.517
What good is it to me
if I'm dead?

03:45.517 --> 03:49.104
What if I told you that this is
the gift of immortality?

04:32.940 --> 04:35.859
Hey! Why didn't you
call me back this weekend?

04:35.859 --> 04:37.778
I left you, like,
10 messages.

04:37.778 --> 04:41.073
I had to change my phone number,
my bank account, my passwords,

04:41.073 --> 04:42.157
and my security questions.

04:42.157 --> 04:43.784
Are you smoking
an actual cigarette?

04:43.784 --> 04:46.787
- Can you give me a puff?
- He has files on us.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.789
They're locked away
in this tiny little room.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.582
He knows the names
of my parents.

04:50.582 --> 04:54.003
He knows the name of the gym
that I hardly ever go to.

04:54.003 --> 04:55.421
He knows everything.

05:15.149 --> 05:17.109
Delivery for
Mr. Sang Woo.

05:19.611 --> 05:21.905
I'm sorry.

05:21.905 --> 05:25.284
Every time I hear his name,
I picture his little face.

05:31.123 --> 05:33.083
Okay. Hilltech Corp.
Do you remember them?

05:33.083 --> 05:34.668
- Artificial limbs in Moscow.
- Yeah.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.463
I did a deep dive into their
business this weekend.

05:37.463 --> 05:39.631
I ran comparisons on how they
were doing

05:39.631 --> 05:41.008
before and after Patoff's
arrival.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.177
They had an annual turnover
of 26 million.

05:43.177 --> 05:45.345
Now, it's up
to more than 50 million.

05:45.345 --> 05:48.348
He almost doubled their output
in six months.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.477
Maybe he's just...
really good at his job.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.605
Okay. So, for shits
and giggles,

05:54.605 --> 05:57.066
I start doing research
into amputations in Russia.

05:57.066 --> 05:59.234
- This was your weekend?
- Well, I gotta attend

05:59.234 --> 06:01.195
a Catholic mass tonight,
so there's balance.

06:01.195 --> 06:02.780
As a nation,
they're averaging

06:02.780 --> 06:05.115
around 150,000 amputations
a year.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.826
Suddenly, our friend Patoff
joins the arm and leg business.

06:07.826 --> 06:11.580
Now, they're up
to 290,000 amputations a year.

06:11.580 --> 06:14.083
He almost doubles it. I mean,
what, suddenly there's...

06:14.083 --> 06:16.543
there's twice as many farmers
falling under the plough?

06:16.543 --> 06:18.670
- It makes no sense!
- Numbers spike.

06:18.670 --> 06:21.590
We have to take underlying
factors into consideration.

06:21.590 --> 06:23.133
War. Land mines.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.260
There's disease.

06:25.260 --> 06:26.970
Alright.
Look at this picture.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.765
This is Milani Morozov.
She works closely with this guy,

06:29.765 --> 06:31.391
Viktor Kulzer.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.560
Who signed
the same contract as Sang.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.729
Right. Three months
after this picture was taken,

06:35.729 --> 06:37.481
Kulzer...
Dead.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.277
- She's pretty.
- Still is,

06:42.277 --> 06:44.029
but she's had
a few upgrades.

06:44.029 --> 06:47.407
New arm.
New leg. New jaw.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.660
Wait.
So, you're telling me

06:49.660 --> 06:53.747
that he convinced her
to amputate half of her body?

06:53.747 --> 06:56.917
Yeah, for the betterment
of Mr. Kulzer's interests.

07:16.520 --> 07:19.273
I'm a busy man, so let's cut
through the bullshit.

07:19.273 --> 07:20.607
What are you selling?

07:20.607 --> 07:23.610
I can assure you that I'm not
a salesman, Mr. Sang.

07:23.610 --> 07:26.905
I'm offering you
my services as a consultant.

07:26.905 --> 07:28.782
I don't need
a consultant.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.534
Look around you,
Grandpa.

07:30.534 --> 07:32.494
I'm doing great.

07:32.494 --> 07:37.332
On the contrary, Mr. Sang.
I have taken the liberty

07:37.332 --> 07:41.044
of reviewing
CompWare's accounts and ledgers.

07:42.880 --> 07:45.048
You can only continue
to pay your staff

07:45.048 --> 07:46.300
for another four months.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.097
Who the fuck are you?

07:52.097 --> 07:53.432
Regus Patoff.

07:53.432 --> 07:56.602
I thought I made that clear
in our introduction.

07:56.602 --> 08:00.022
Feel free to make a note
this time in your hand device.

08:07.112 --> 08:11.825
You over-reward your staff
and undervalue your product.

08:11.825 --> 08:16.788
People take advantage
of your age, race, and naivetÃ©.

08:16.788 --> 08:20.083
The banks won't lend you
another dime.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.877
When your investors learn

08:21.877 --> 08:24.922
about this dire state
of affairs,

08:24.922 --> 08:27.925
they'll replace you
with someone competent.

08:27.925 --> 08:32.387
Now, as uncomfortable
as these facts are,

08:32.387 --> 08:34.556
you know them all to be true.

08:36.350 --> 08:38.810
- Nobody talks to me like this.
- Three nights ago,

08:38.810 --> 08:42.439
you stood on your 19th-floor
downtown balcony in tears

08:42.439 --> 08:43.690
and wanted to jump.

08:44.942 --> 08:48.946
My question to you, Mr. Sang,
is this:

08:48.946 --> 08:50.405
What stopped you?

08:52.532 --> 08:53.992
How do you know that?

08:53.992 --> 08:57.329
The only thing that kept you on
that ledge is the fear

08:57.329 --> 08:59.748
of delegitimizing your own
legacy,

08:59.748 --> 09:02.084
of not being remembered.

09:03.377 --> 09:05.796
I can see that you're upset,
Mr. Sang.

09:05.796 --> 09:09.591
I'll step out for a moment,
let you can gather yourself.

09:09.591 --> 09:12.010
No. Stay.

09:21.812 --> 09:24.815
- I work as hard as I can.
- And the problems compound.

09:24.815 --> 09:27.526
I just need to come up
with the perfect game.

09:27.526 --> 09:30.779
But your prayers go unanswered.

09:30.779 --> 09:33.115
Engage my services, Mr. Sang,

09:33.115 --> 09:36.076
and your concerns
will cease to be.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.083
When can you start?

09:43.083 --> 09:46.420
Unfortunately,
not until after you're gone.

09:46.420 --> 09:47.421
Gone?

09:47.421 --> 09:49.715
Oh, did I not make
that part clear?

09:49.715 --> 09:52.968
Forgive me. You're my third
client meeting of the day,

09:52.968 --> 09:55.762
and, uh, sometimes,
conversations blur.

09:55.762 --> 09:59.224
My contract begins
when your life ends.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.691
I'm good.

10:49.691 --> 10:52.152
He locked himself in there
and won't come out.

10:52.152 --> 10:55.447
Patoff ever tell you about
Frank Florez? Could be with a Z.

10:55.447 --> 10:57.657
- Could be an S.
- Doesn't ring a bell.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.951
The Russian doll was talking
about him and said that

10:59.951 --> 11:02.954
if I wanna know about Patoff,
I gotta find Frank Florez.

11:02.954 --> 11:04.581
Why didn't you
tell me earlier?

11:04.581 --> 11:07.292
Because there's 32 with Z
and 1,100 with S,

11:07.292 --> 11:08.919
according to How Many of Me.

11:08.919 --> 11:11.630
I'm trying to narrow it down,
but there's nothing online

11:11.630 --> 11:14.883
about a Frank Florez amputee,
either spelling.

11:14.883 --> 11:17.344
You never told me
how Friday night drinks ended.

11:19.304 --> 11:20.931
Ugh. Let's just say

11:20.931 --> 11:24.768
that he went out of his way
to show me who the boss was.

11:24.768 --> 11:27.604
How does Patti
feel about that?

11:27.604 --> 11:29.231
I didn't really tell her
everything.

11:29.231 --> 11:30.982
- How come?
- If she knows what I'm doing,

11:30.982 --> 11:32.859
she's gonna think I'm doing it
to avoid work.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.319
- Are you?
- No! This guy...

11:34.319 --> 11:36.238
he's not who he pretends to be.

11:36.238 --> 11:37.697
Denise DeLilo!

11:41.410 --> 11:43.703
Denise DeLilo!

11:47.666 --> 11:50.043
One of you must be
Denise DeLilo!

11:54.798 --> 11:55.841
Very well.

11:57.426 --> 11:59.052
Why does that name
sound familiar?

12:14.818 --> 12:15.819
In.

12:19.948 --> 12:22.075
- Mr. Patoff?
- Yeah.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.578
You were looking for Denise?

12:24.578 --> 12:26.830
DeLilo.
I have her right here.

12:26.830 --> 12:30.709
$5,256.70 every month,

12:30.709 --> 12:34.504
and her output
is quite literally zero.

12:34.504 --> 12:36.381
Perhaps she's a ghost?

12:36.381 --> 12:39.134
Denise has been on long-term
sickness since January.

12:39.134 --> 12:41.094
And Mr. Sang continued
to pay her?

12:41.094 --> 12:43.763
If he wants to avoid
a discrimination suit, yes.

12:43.763 --> 12:44.890
What's wrong with her?

12:44.890 --> 12:45.974
Stress.

12:48.685 --> 12:49.895
Daisy Hoyte.

12:51.229 --> 12:52.230
Allergies.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.859
Dylan Garrety?

12:55.859 --> 12:57.194
Undisclosed mental health issue.

13:00.864 --> 13:03.575
I do not wish to speak ill
of the dead,

13:03.575 --> 13:06.578
but Mr. Sang did not have
a good head for business.

13:06.578 --> 13:09.331
I think Sang saw himself more
on the creative end

13:09.331 --> 13:11.666
of the spectrum,
and he was only 20.

13:13.251 --> 13:16.338
The situation is more dire
than I anticipated.

13:16.338 --> 13:18.423
Unless we act now
to reduce costs,

13:18.423 --> 13:20.800
we will not survive
another six weeks.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.385
Six weeks?

13:22.385 --> 13:25.430
If we cut everything back to
the bone, perhaps two months.

13:29.851 --> 13:33.271
Hey. Hey.
What do you think weighs more,

13:33.271 --> 13:35.565
three hyenas
or one male adult gorilla?

13:35.565 --> 13:37.526
How long before this is ready
to launch?

13:37.526 --> 13:40.320
Ugh. There's no one out there
that can market this correctly.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.864
- And if there was?
- Mm... three months?

13:42.864 --> 13:45.784
Well, you might want
to work weekends, hotshot.

13:45.784 --> 13:47.369
We got six weeks.

13:47.369 --> 13:49.496
Then none of us
are getting paid.

13:49.496 --> 13:52.999
What? Patoff told you that we
have six weeks until shutdown?

13:52.999 --> 13:54.918
- Just now.
- I don't believe a word

13:54.918 --> 13:56.836
that comes out of that
cocksucker's face.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.089
Don't you see?
This is another test.

14:00.799 --> 14:04.302
Hey, Raul. What do we got that's
closest to Upskirt Jungle?

14:04.302 --> 14:06.721
It's basically Catchy Cubey
but not in space.

14:06.721 --> 14:09.516
And how long would it take to
reskin that old,

14:09.516 --> 14:10.892
forgotten
piece of shit?

14:10.892 --> 14:13.353
It's mostly graphics.
If we get art on it,

14:13.353 --> 14:15.522
we could probably
have a mock-up by tomorrow.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.107
Let's aim for tonight.

14:17.107 --> 14:19.442
You think you're gonna
save CompWare with that?

14:19.442 --> 14:20.860
Interesting fact:

14:20.860 --> 14:23.613
Three hyenas weigh the same
as one male adult gorilla.

14:25.532 --> 14:26.616
Oh, my God.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.875
I won a bid
for a ping-pong table.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.794
They said it had
to be cash.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.808
You have
life insurance, do you not?

14:53.143 --> 14:54.519
Of course I do.

14:54.519 --> 14:55.979
How is this any different?

14:57.439 --> 14:59.941
In the event
of your untimely death,

14:59.941 --> 15:04.195
what provisions have you made
to secure your legacy?

15:07.282 --> 15:10.368
- None.
- Well, then now is the time.

15:10.368 --> 15:12.495
Under my guidance,
Mr. Sang,

15:12.495 --> 15:14.539
people will idolize you.

15:14.539 --> 15:16.875
One day,
they'll kneel before you.

15:22.213 --> 15:23.757
I should run this by my team.

15:23.757 --> 15:27.385
Your team is the reason why you
are in this predicament.

15:27.385 --> 15:31.556
When did Ahn Sang Woo
stop listening to himself?

15:31.556 --> 15:34.267
No one tells me what to do,
that includes you.

15:36.478 --> 15:40.357
You have accomplished
so much in your short life.

15:41.733 --> 15:45.445
Think how much you can achieve
in death.

16:35.578 --> 16:36.663
Craig.

16:38.248 --> 16:40.875
- He changed the locks.
- What?

16:40.875 --> 16:42.252
In the records room.

16:42.252 --> 16:45.797
I just looked to see if he had
a file on Frank Florez.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.507
You still have his key?

16:47.507 --> 16:49.968
I got it copied and put
the original back

16:49.968 --> 16:51.428
in his drawer Saturday morning.

16:51.428 --> 16:53.888
What has Nancy fucking Drew
learned from this experience?

16:53.888 --> 16:55.807
That he knows somebody's
been down there.

16:55.807 --> 16:58.560
Number one, yes. Number two,
he's fucking with you just like

16:58.560 --> 17:01.354
- he did to me on Friday.
- What happened between you two?

17:02.939 --> 17:05.275
I told you.
I had too much to drink,

17:05.275 --> 17:07.610
- and I went home.
- Okay. If I took him

17:07.610 --> 17:10.321
to a hot yoga class and then
grabbed coffee after,

17:10.321 --> 17:13.199
wouldn't you be curious?

17:13.199 --> 17:15.410
He tried to get me to do
something

17:15.410 --> 17:17.036
that I didn't want
to do.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.705
Nothing sexual.
Nothing like that.

17:18.705 --> 17:22.083
Just, like...
really fucked up.

17:24.085 --> 17:26.296
- Did you do it?
- What?

17:26.296 --> 17:28.256
The thing he asked you to do.

17:29.799 --> 17:30.925
No.

17:32.635 --> 17:33.720
Good for you.

17:35.096 --> 17:36.931
Thanks.

17:47.317 --> 17:49.277
In!

17:51.821 --> 17:52.822
Mr. Patoff?

17:56.576 --> 17:58.286
Is it important?

17:59.537 --> 18:01.498
It could be
half a million dollars.

18:03.833 --> 18:06.836
I don't know if this is
a company asset or not,

18:06.836 --> 18:09.547
but last year,
Sang invested in a yacht.

18:09.547 --> 18:10.757
- It sunk.
- Yes.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.051
He didn't know that
when he wrote the check.

18:13.051 --> 18:14.594
I don't know if it's
salvageable,

18:14.594 --> 18:16.763
but we could possibly get
something for it.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.141
Mr. Sang was impulsive.

18:20.141 --> 18:22.977
Impulsive people
are easily fooled.

18:22.977 --> 18:25.271
Are you impulsive, Elaine?

18:26.564 --> 18:29.567
I'll have to get back to you
on that, Mr. Patoff.

18:36.658 --> 18:39.285
- Raul, we done yet?
- Yeah, it's there.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.370
It's buggy-as-fuck, though.

18:40.370 --> 18:42.288
You sure you really wanna
share this?

18:42.288 --> 18:43.998
Trust me.
It's good enough, baby.

19:10.108 --> 19:11.109
In!

19:13.069 --> 19:16.739
Mr. Patoff,
um, is it a good time?

19:18.074 --> 19:20.577
Time will soon run out
for us all.

19:22.203 --> 19:23.413
Yeah.

19:23.413 --> 19:28.001
Um... I heard that we were in
a bit of a spot.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.378
I might have
something that can help.

19:30.378 --> 19:32.755
Another sunken ship?

19:32.755 --> 19:35.133
Uh, the game that you liked,
Upskirt Jungle.

19:35.133 --> 19:37.969
I think if we put all of our
resources into it,

19:37.969 --> 19:39.596
we can launch by
the end-of-the-month.

19:39.596 --> 19:42.473
We might make some quick revenue
if we market it right.

19:44.434 --> 19:46.603
- So soon?
- We did a mock-up for you.

19:46.603 --> 19:48.771
It's a reskin,
but the bones are good.

19:51.024 --> 19:54.652
You know what? I can just put it
on your phone if you want.

19:54.652 --> 19:57.822
Then you can look at it anytime.
You can look at it in the bath,

19:57.822 --> 19:59.699
You can look at it on the can.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.702
All you need is a local server
and the go button.

20:09.626 --> 20:13.129
I really enjoyed our drink
on Friday, Craig.

20:13.129 --> 20:14.881
Thank you for inviting me.

20:17.175 --> 20:18.968
Any time.

20:18.968 --> 20:21.346
I hope the theatrics of our
little intervention

20:21.346 --> 20:23.932
- didn't unnerve you.
- Oh. Me? No, no.

20:23.932 --> 20:26.643
I just had a few too many
on an empty stomach.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.144
Is that what it was?

20:31.064 --> 20:33.650
Did you have any luck
finding your friend?

20:33.650 --> 20:36.527
I'm afraid there is
no happy ending for Milani.

20:36.527 --> 20:39.572
Since I've known her, she's been
on a run of misfortune

20:39.572 --> 20:41.574
that you'd be hard-pressed
to believe.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.785
Huh. I can imagine.

20:43.785 --> 20:47.372
It's the red button with the CW
on it. You're all set.

20:47.372 --> 20:50.541
- Mind if I take the shortcut?
- It's always the best route.

21:18.903 --> 21:21.114
No money up front.

21:21.114 --> 21:24.492
No share of profit. You don't
even pay yourself a salary.

21:24.492 --> 21:27.745
- What's in it for you?
- Please do not concern yourself

21:27.745 --> 21:29.872
with me, Mr. Sang.

21:29.872 --> 21:31.624
I'm rewarded enough.

21:33.459 --> 21:35.086
What have I got to lose?

21:44.971 --> 21:47.640
That is our business concluded.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.726
It didn't even cost me
a dollar.

21:49.726 --> 21:53.521
A dollar that you can ill afford
to spare, sir.

21:56.607 --> 21:58.776
I suppose we'll never see
each other again.

21:58.776 --> 22:02.113
We will not, but it's been
a great pleasure to meet you,

22:02.113 --> 22:04.157
and I shall return in two weeks.

22:05.616 --> 22:08.327
- Two weeks?
- To commence work.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.871
There's a lot to do.

22:11.289 --> 22:14.083
- But you said...
- I can start sooner,

22:14.083 --> 22:17.462
but that really is a decision
for you to make for yourself.

22:19.881 --> 22:22.633
I once had a client who placed

22:22.633 --> 22:25.219
a sharpened pencil
up each nostril

22:25.219 --> 22:30.141
and then lowered his face with
great vehemence onto a desk.

22:30.141 --> 22:33.102
Most inventive.
Remarkably brave.

22:35.980 --> 22:38.775
I don't suppose
you have any use for pencils.

22:40.443 --> 22:42.320
I am not about to die.

22:48.534 --> 22:52.121
I believe I made that very clear
from the outset.

22:52.121 --> 22:55.208
Without my intervention,
in a few months from now,

22:55.208 --> 22:58.836
there will be no CompWare
and no Mr. Sang to continue.

22:58.836 --> 23:01.422
It really is now or never.

23:04.926 --> 23:06.928
There must be another way. I..

23:06.928 --> 23:08.638
I'll do anything.

23:08.638 --> 23:11.891
Come, come, Mr. Sang.

23:11.891 --> 23:14.435
This is not the end.
This is the beginning.

23:14.435 --> 23:16.395
The contract is signed.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.064
Your legacy is secured.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.109
There's nothing now to stop you.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.780
Perhaps you would like me

23:25.780 --> 23:29.659
to make arrangements
on your behalf?

23:29.659 --> 23:31.410
Arrangements?

23:31.410 --> 23:33.412
Ninety-three percent
of my clients prefer

23:33.412 --> 23:36.040
not to know the details.

23:36.040 --> 23:38.209
Shall I go ahead
and book for you?

23:47.552 --> 23:50.388
There is
a small administrative fee

23:50.388 --> 23:52.473
that I charge for this service.

23:52.473 --> 23:54.892
It's somewhat time-consuming
on my end.

23:57.770 --> 23:58.813
How much?

23:58.813 --> 24:00.731
Your accounts
are in such disarray,

24:00.731 --> 24:03.442
I'd feel guilty
charging you any money,

24:03.442 --> 24:08.239
but perhaps there's another way
that you can compensate me.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.785
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

24:18.124 --> 24:19.500
The body of Christ.

24:41.522 --> 24:42.815
Hey.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.692
Hey. You left
without saying goodbye.

24:44.692 --> 24:47.695
Oh, you looked busy.
I slipped out at 6:00.

24:47.695 --> 24:48.779
Are you home already?

24:48.779 --> 24:50.656
I... I'm actually out to dinner.

24:50.656 --> 24:52.700
I rearranged
my date from Friday.

24:52.700 --> 24:54.577
Oh. How's that going?

24:54.577 --> 24:55.953
If you're not feeling it,

24:55.953 --> 24:58.414
you can just say the word
"pineapple."

24:58.414 --> 25:02.001
He asked for the check
and went to the bathroom.

25:03.085 --> 25:04.921
Sigma male.
Expects you to pay.

25:04.921 --> 25:07.006
Those guys are so cool.

25:07.006 --> 25:08.633
- What do you need, Craig?
- Okay.

25:08.633 --> 25:10.134
So, Mr. One-in-a-Million,
Frank Florez?

25:10.134 --> 25:13.971
I think I found him, or at least
I found the number for him.

25:13.971 --> 25:15.932
- How?
- I installed some stalker-ware

25:15.932 --> 25:18.601
on Patoff's phone.
He doesn't have a clue.

25:18.601 --> 25:21.062
So, as soon as he fired up
the demo,

25:21.062 --> 25:23.439
I grabbed the contact
from his phone, and bingo,

25:23.439 --> 25:24.649
SeÃ±or Florez popped up.

25:24.649 --> 25:27.151
No recent activity,
but we got the number.

25:27.151 --> 25:29.320
- Did you call him?
- Not yet. I can.

25:29.320 --> 25:31.239
I was thinking maybe a female
voice

25:31.239 --> 25:32.323
would be less threatening.

25:32.323 --> 25:33.908
We don't know
anything about him

25:33.908 --> 25:35.826
and we don't wanna scare
him off.

25:35.826 --> 25:37.620
Just send me
his details,

25:37.620 --> 25:39.330
and I will call him tomorrow.

25:41.791 --> 25:43.542
Hey. It's okay,
what we're doing?

25:43.542 --> 25:46.295
Right?
Going behind his back?

25:46.295 --> 25:48.297
I mean, we're just checking
his credentials,

25:48.297 --> 25:49.966
and if he's legit,

25:49.966 --> 25:52.635
Patoff just might be
what CompWare needs.

25:52.635 --> 25:55.930
I mean, maybe Sang did some good
business when he hired him.

25:55.930 --> 25:58.432
But he's not gonna
find out, will he?

26:00.017 --> 26:01.018
Pineapple.

26:02.561 --> 26:03.938
Hi.

27:51.921 --> 27:52.922
Ah, slowly!

29:16.797 --> 29:18.549
Hey.

29:18.549 --> 29:21.010
- Hey. Did you call him yet?
- What am I?

29:21.010 --> 29:22.636
- I'm not your assistant.
- Oh, right.

29:22.636 --> 29:23.804
You're my creative liaison.

29:23.804 --> 29:25.848
Frank Florez owns a jewelry
store in Pomona.

29:25.848 --> 29:28.392
- That's pretty much all I got.
- How does Patoff know him?

29:28.392 --> 29:30.394
I didn't wanna ask him
that over the phone,

29:30.394 --> 29:32.646
so we're gonna have to drive
one weekend over there

29:32.646 --> 29:34.148
- and meet him in person.
- Fuck!

29:34.148 --> 29:36.901
I can't do it this weekend.
I signed up for a church thing.

29:36.901 --> 29:40.070
- I'm not doing this alone.
- Okay. I'll think of something.

29:40.070 --> 29:42.531
Jesus forgives, right?
Did you hear that he sent

29:42.531 --> 29:45.493
an entire demo link
to the entire office last night?

29:45.493 --> 29:47.953
I'm sure it's great.
You worked hard on it.

29:47.953 --> 29:49.580
No. The stalker-ware's
on that version.

29:49.580 --> 29:52.708
I woke up this morning with
access to every fucker's device.

29:52.708 --> 29:54.460
- So then delete it.
- Wow.

29:54.460 --> 29:57.922
Thank God you know so much about
the intricacies of cyber-crime.

30:27.159 --> 30:30.120
Mr. Sang will guide us
through the storm.
