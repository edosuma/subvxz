01:00.126 --> 01:03.061
Are you my dad?

01:03.063 --> 01:04.596
What if I am?

01:04.598 --> 01:07.800
Smurf has been lying to us
and using us for years.

01:07.802 --> 01:09.568
Cath is dead.
Smurf killed her.

01:10.337 --> 01:12.004
And she killed Javi, too.

01:12.006 --> 01:13.738
So, I dug up his body,

01:13.740 --> 01:15.540
shot him
with one of Smurf's guns,

01:15.542 --> 01:17.276
and I called in
a tip to the cops.

01:20.347 --> 01:21.413
- Are you Smurf?
- Yeah.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.881
Trujillo sent us.

01:22.883 --> 01:25.017
Time to cut a deal, Janine.
Give up your boys.

01:25.019 --> 01:28.220
Janine transferred her power
of attorney to her grandson.

01:28.222 --> 01:29.754
Oh.

01:29.756 --> 01:32.557
What'd you do with all
the things from my storage unit?

01:32.559 --> 01:33.625
It's all safe.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.894
What do you hear from Cath?

01:35.896 --> 01:37.629
Ask Pope.
Pope knows.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.164
Go ahead and do it.

01:39.166 --> 01:40.565
I know it was Smurf.

01:40.567 --> 01:42.901
I forgive you.
I forgive you.

01:48.509 --> 01:51.176
Hey, Baz, I can't stay.
I'm sorry.

02:03.323 --> 02:06.324
Bilateral. Pulse ox 84.

02:06.326 --> 02:07.992
Faint pulse.

02:09.395 --> 02:10.729
He's already lost
a lot of blood,

02:10.731 --> 02:12.130
so it'll have to be Tri-City.

02:18.405 --> 02:22.274
10-30, male, multiple gunshot
wounds to the chest and neck.

02:22.276 --> 02:24.877
Less than 24.
BP 90/60.

02:24.879 --> 02:27.479
Gonna need 2 liters of O-neg
for arrival.

02:27.481 --> 02:30.082
Pushing 1 liter of epi.

02:30.084 --> 02:31.616
Copy that.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.891
Patient aspirating.

02:38.893 --> 02:40.359
Copy that.
Stand by.

02:40.361 --> 02:42.427
Quick.
What do we got?

02:42.429 --> 02:44.229
We've got multiple gunshot
wounds to the chest and...

02:44.231 --> 02:46.831
I need the chart.
We've got one right by his neck.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.033
Sheila, call blood bank and
order 2 units of O-neg, stat.

02:49.035 --> 02:51.236
- Copy that.
- Notify the O.R.

02:51.238 --> 02:52.905
Start us a separate line...
Patient has abnormal rhythm

02:52.907 --> 02:54.639
and was intubated en route...large-bored,
wide open.

02:54.641 --> 02:56.775
- Coming in! Move!
- Take the chart, sir.

02:56.777 --> 02:59.578
Call the O.R. 2 units of O-neg.
Okay. On three.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.513
One, two, three.
Go.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.847
Okay.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.717
Watch the line.
Flip. Go.

03:04.719 --> 03:07.386
- Cutdown tray.
- Let's get that second line in.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.921
Let's get
that B.P. cuff on him.

03:08.923 --> 03:11.590
- O-neg is here.
- O-neg is here and onboard.

04:25.132 --> 04:26.532
Hey.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.077
Hey.

04:44.485 --> 04:46.685
It's time for school.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.023
Scalpel!

05:59.025 --> 06:02.694
- Alert the blood bank A.S.A.P.
- Scalpel's right here.

06:02.696 --> 06:03.828
Charge to 120.
Give me the paddle.

06:03.830 --> 06:04.763
Charge 120.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.766
Clear.
Still V-tach.

06:07.768 --> 06:10.635
Start chest compressions.

06:10.637 --> 06:11.703
Scalpel.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.572
- Scalpel.
- Possible tension pneumo.

06:13.574 --> 06:14.973
- Open up those fluids.
- Suction!

06:14.975 --> 06:16.374
Clamp.

06:19.513 --> 06:21.513
Sats are at 50.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.874
Buenos dÃ­as.

06:49.876 --> 06:51.143
Buenos dÃ­as.

06:56.150 --> 06:58.951
So, how far did we get
last night?

06:58.953 --> 07:00.953
You were out hard.
Hmm.

07:00.955 --> 07:03.888
Couple hours south
of Tijuana.

07:03.890 --> 07:06.625
Well, thanks for driving
the last bit.

07:06.627 --> 07:09.428
I was, um...
I was pretty wasted.

07:09.430 --> 07:11.630
Yeah, two bottles of tequila
will do that to you.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.098
Mm-hmm.

08:07.488 --> 08:09.021
Charge 150.

08:09.023 --> 08:10.355
Clear.

08:10.357 --> 08:11.690
Paddles.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.291
Everybody clear.

08:14.428 --> 08:16.028
2 milligrams of epi.

08:16.030 --> 08:18.363
No returning
spontaneous circulation.

08:18.365 --> 08:19.631
Epi 10.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.701
Pulse check.

08:22.703 --> 08:25.504
No cardiac activity.

08:27.574 --> 08:28.707
Stop ventilation.

08:28.709 --> 08:33.378
I'm calling it.
Time of death, 6:36 A.M.

08:33.380 --> 08:34.979
6:36.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.453
Someone give an update to...

09:08.715 --> 09:10.715
It looks like we've got
a single shooter.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.117
Victim gave chase.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.119
Before he collapsed, he fired
some rounds down the street,

09:14.121 --> 09:16.455
but doesn't look
like he hit anybody.

09:16.457 --> 09:18.923
There's no blood trail.

09:18.925 --> 09:20.592
Got a 0.9 millimeter?

09:20.594 --> 09:21.994
Four shots, clean.

09:21.996 --> 09:24.863
Fired directly
through the windshield.

09:24.865 --> 09:27.332
Anybody see anything?
Not so far.

09:27.334 --> 09:30.335
Couple suitcases found
in the back of the jeep.

09:30.337 --> 09:33.205
One is the victim's,
one appears to be a woman's,

09:33.207 --> 09:35.874
and the passenger door
was left wide open.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.209
So, the shooter fired

09:37.211 --> 09:40.012
on the driver,
but not the passenger.

09:40.014 --> 09:43.215
Or the passenger
was the shooter.

09:45.151 --> 09:46.685
Any ID
on the luggage?

09:46.687 --> 09:51.490
Not on the woman's.
The victim's passport was found in his bag.

09:51.492 --> 09:53.559
Barry Blackwell.

09:54.695 --> 09:55.894
Baz.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.162
What?

09:57.164 --> 09:58.630
His name is Baz.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.232
What, you know him?

10:00.234 --> 10:01.633
Yeah.

10:01.635 --> 10:04.703
Any idea
who'd want to shoot him?

10:04.705 --> 10:06.438
That's likely
to be a long list.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.241
And how's that?

10:09.243 --> 10:11.309
Wait till you meet
the mother.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.778
You'll want
to shoot someone, too.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.786
Can I help you, officers?

10:55.489 --> 10:57.355
Is this
the Cody residence?

10:57.357 --> 10:59.424
Are you here
about last night's party?

10:59.426 --> 11:02.561
No, sir.

11:02.563 --> 11:04.229
Is Janine Cody home?

11:06.433 --> 11:07.800
What's this about?

11:09.970 --> 11:11.904
Do you know
a Barry Blackwell?

11:11.906 --> 11:14.873
Yeah, he's my brother.

11:16.711 --> 11:18.643
My name
is Officer Collins.

11:18.645 --> 11:20.979
This is Officer Adler.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.447
We were
responding officers

11:22.449 --> 11:25.049
to a shooting last night
involving your brother.

11:25.051 --> 11:26.651
Mr. Blackwell was found
with several...

11:41.602 --> 11:43.001
Where's J?

11:43.003 --> 11:44.269
What?

11:44.271 --> 11:46.671
Where the hell is J?
He's not answering his cell.

11:46.673 --> 11:48.140
I don't know.

11:48.142 --> 11:50.809
Sometimes... sometimes he goes
running in the morning.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.076
Where?!

11:52.078 --> 11:54.679
Down on the Strand.
What...

11:56.817 --> 11:59.217
Get dressed.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.152
Now!

12:00.154 --> 12:01.553
Okay.
Move your ass!

12:01.555 --> 12:03.288
Okay!

12:25.245 --> 12:26.511
Get in.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.446
What?

12:28.448 --> 12:30.315
Get the hell in!

12:30.317 --> 12:31.650
Why?

12:32.787 --> 12:33.852
Baz is dead.

12:33.854 --> 12:36.789
What?

12:47.267 --> 12:49.802
How?

12:49.804 --> 12:52.070
I don't know.

12:52.072 --> 12:57.142
Cops only said he'd been...
he'd been shot.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.344
By who?

12:59.346 --> 13:00.345
They didn't say.

13:00.347 --> 13:01.346
You didn't ask?

13:01.348 --> 13:03.315
Course, I asked!

13:10.024 --> 13:11.690
Baz is dead?

13:18.365 --> 13:20.165
Where's Craig?

13:20.167 --> 13:24.703
He took off last night
with some money and the Scout.

13:24.705 --> 13:25.838
You try calling him?

13:25.840 --> 13:27.772
Yeah.

13:27.774 --> 13:28.907
He's on his way to Mexico.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.509
He probably
doesn't have service.

13:30.511 --> 13:32.978
He leave around the same time
Baz got shot?

13:36.383 --> 13:38.316
What's that
supposed to mean, J?

13:41.321 --> 13:44.589
Craig didn't have anything
to do with Baz getting shot.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.258
Okay.
What?!

13:46.260 --> 13:47.459
I said okay.

13:50.531 --> 13:51.730
You need to find Craig.

13:51.732 --> 13:53.065
They could be coming
for him, too.

13:53.067 --> 13:54.466
Who's coming for him?

13:54.468 --> 13:57.802
Smurf is in jail
for killing Javi, sweetie.

13:57.804 --> 13:59.204
You don't think
his crew's going to have

13:59.206 --> 14:00.605
something to say
about that?

14:06.146 --> 14:08.113
What about Lucy?

14:09.216 --> 14:11.150
She was with Baz yesterday.

14:12.753 --> 14:13.886
Find Craig now.

14:21.228 --> 14:23.962
There ain't no way I'm gonna
be a grandmother at 33.

14:23.964 --> 14:26.164
She's going
to the damn clinic.

14:26.166 --> 14:29.501
Why don't
you raise it yourself?

14:29.503 --> 14:32.170
Being a grandmother
is the reward they give you

14:32.172 --> 14:33.838
for raising
those bitches.

14:33.840 --> 14:38.176
You know, you drop one of 'em
on their heads, they bounce.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.579
That must've been
what happened to your Tony.

14:40.581 --> 14:43.315
Somebody definitely dropped
that <i>idiota</i> on his head.

14:43.317 --> 14:45.384
Is that why you always
dressing slutty

14:45.386 --> 14:48.253
and showing off your ta-tas
every time he comes around?

14:49.924 --> 14:50.989
Cody!

14:50.991 --> 14:52.858
Somebody here for you.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.393
Who?

14:55.395 --> 14:56.929
Let's go.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.365
Play me.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.308
Door is open.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.848
To what do I owe
this honor?

15:19.286 --> 15:21.153
Baz is dead.

15:29.630 --> 15:30.895
What?

15:30.897 --> 15:32.631
Last night.

15:32.633 --> 15:36.835
Somebody shot him four times
in the driveway at his house.

15:39.440 --> 15:41.106
Looks like the killer
waited outside

15:41.108 --> 15:43.908
for Baz to come out
and just unloaded on him.

15:48.915 --> 15:51.650
This is Detective French,
Oceanside P.D. Ohh.

15:52.787 --> 15:56.188
You know anybody who would
want Mr. Blackwell dead?

15:56.190 --> 15:59.324
No.

16:00.527 --> 16:04.463
There was luggage
in the back of his jeep,

16:04.465 --> 16:08.801
Mr. Blackwell's and a bag filled
with some women's clothing.

16:08.803 --> 16:10.469
Any idea who she might be?

16:11.605 --> 16:16.008
There's a, uh, Mexican woman
he sees sometimes,

16:16.010 --> 16:21.413
but, um, his brothers would know
more about that than I do.

16:23.550 --> 16:24.683
Ohh!

16:24.685 --> 16:26.751
Oh, no.

17:29.450 --> 17:30.915
Homicide cops called.

17:30.917 --> 17:33.452
They want us to come in
for interviews.

17:37.458 --> 17:39.324
- We going to go?
- Yes.

17:39.326 --> 17:40.592
And say what?

17:40.594 --> 17:41.794
You say nothing.

17:41.796 --> 17:43.996
You keep your mouth shut,
you look sad.

17:43.998 --> 17:45.064
I am sad.

17:47.201 --> 17:49.401
Nachos?

17:49.403 --> 17:50.935
Jesus Christ.
Do we look hungry?

17:50.937 --> 17:53.739
Nobody is hungry.
Sit your ass down!

18:00.347 --> 18:02.481
Who's gonna tell Smurf?

18:02.483 --> 18:05.217
Oh, screw Smurf.

18:05.219 --> 18:06.485
It may have been her.

18:06.487 --> 18:07.820
It wasn't her, man.

18:07.822 --> 18:10.489
Everything that was
going on with her and Baz,

18:10.491 --> 18:11.623
him taking her stuff.

18:11.625 --> 18:12.992
You think she's gonna
let that go?

18:15.562 --> 18:18.363
What about the cops?

18:18.365 --> 18:19.431
Could've been them.

18:19.433 --> 18:21.033
The cops?

18:21.035 --> 18:23.702
Yeah, the cops.

18:27.241 --> 18:28.440
What do you remember

18:28.442 --> 18:31.176
about going out
to the desert with Smurf?

18:31.178 --> 18:31.910
Manny's funeral.

18:31.912 --> 18:34.379
How many men
were in Javi's crew?

18:34.381 --> 18:35.380
I don't know.

18:35.382 --> 18:38.583
Was it like, 5, 10, 50?

18:38.585 --> 18:40.118
I don't know, Pope.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.187
It's not like
they introduced themselves.

18:42.189 --> 18:43.655
There was just people
hanging around.

18:43.657 --> 18:45.323
Christ, Pope.
What do you suggest we do?

18:45.325 --> 18:46.791
Go in there,
guns a-blazing?

18:46.793 --> 18:48.260
If we don't retaliate,
they'll think we're weak!

18:48.262 --> 18:50.795
Retaliate against who?!
We don't know who they are!

18:50.797 --> 18:53.532
Baz said Smurf paid one
of Javi's crew to kill Javi!

19:01.942 --> 19:04.943
We don't even know
if that's true, man.

19:04.945 --> 19:09.614
Smurf and Baz have been
lying to us for years.

19:17.091 --> 19:18.891
What about Lucy?

19:18.893 --> 19:21.226
Huh?

19:21.228 --> 19:23.028
Where's Lucy right now?

19:24.831 --> 19:26.631
I know she knew about Baz
stealing Smurf's shit.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.567
<i>Our</i> shit.
What?

19:28.569 --> 19:30.168
That stuff was not Smurf's.

19:30.170 --> 19:32.905
It belonged to the family.
All of us.

19:37.177 --> 19:39.244
Who's gonna
take care of Lena?

19:39.246 --> 19:42.514
Both of her parents
are gone.

19:42.516 --> 19:44.449
Does she end up
in foster care?

19:47.521 --> 19:50.522
No. She's not going
into foster care.

19:50.524 --> 19:51.990
Well, Baz is dead
and Smurf's in jail...

19:51.992 --> 19:54.693
She's not going
to goddamn foster care!

19:55.930 --> 19:57.796
Okay?!

19:57.798 --> 19:59.531
Yeah.

20:01.735 --> 20:04.469
What about the funeral?

20:04.471 --> 20:06.872
Aren't we supposed
to take care of that shit?

20:09.543 --> 20:12.144
Make the arrangements?

20:13.413 --> 20:15.547
Pick a casket?

20:37.772 --> 20:39.571
Sorry for your loss.

20:39.573 --> 20:41.006
Thank you.

20:43.043 --> 20:45.544
Went by the house
like you asked.

20:47.314 --> 20:48.580
It wasn't there.

20:48.582 --> 20:50.783
What wasn't there?

20:50.785 --> 20:52.717
Somebody
got there first.

20:52.719 --> 20:54.186
Took your things.

20:54.188 --> 20:56.254
All of my things?

20:56.256 --> 20:58.190
Yeah.

20:58.192 --> 21:01.593
That gonna be a problem
for our arrangement?

21:01.595 --> 21:03.061
No.
No.

21:03.063 --> 21:04.463
You sure?

21:08.202 --> 21:09.735
I'm sure.

21:12.206 --> 21:14.406
Good.

21:24.418 --> 21:25.884
Hey.

21:25.886 --> 21:28.086
It's time
to go see the cops.

21:28.088 --> 21:29.888
Okay.

21:32.559 --> 21:34.626
You don't seem
too upset about Baz.

21:37.764 --> 21:41.299
I've lost people
a lot closer to me than Baz.

21:47.107 --> 21:51.376
Where did he hide
the shit you stole from Smurf?

21:51.378 --> 21:52.711
He never told me.

21:52.713 --> 21:54.513
Are you sure about that?

21:54.515 --> 21:57.449
Yes.
I'm sure.

22:05.792 --> 22:08.661
Come on.
We don't want to be late.

22:14.535 --> 22:16.068
- Ready to go?
- Yeah.

22:21.275 --> 22:23.942
Whoa. Where the hell
do you think you're going?

22:23.944 --> 22:26.211
Well, I thought we were
all gonna go see the cops.

22:26.213 --> 22:27.812
They don't need
to talk to you.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.013
Well, I thought
all of us were...

22:29.015 --> 22:30.815
What did you think?
You're not family.

22:30.817 --> 22:32.751
She can't stay here
by herself.

22:32.753 --> 22:35.153
It's not safe.

22:39.760 --> 22:41.493
You wait in the car.

22:41.495 --> 22:46.365
Nobody's gonna take a shot at us
in a police station parking lot.

22:46.367 --> 22:47.566
You find Craig?

22:47.568 --> 22:49.101
No.
Try him again.

22:49.103 --> 22:53.372
I called him like 10 times.
Try him again!

24:04.779 --> 24:07.579
You okay, baby?

24:07.581 --> 24:08.781
Yeah.
You?

24:08.783 --> 24:12.384
It's horrible.

24:12.386 --> 24:15.253
Having your father
murdered like that.

24:19.593 --> 24:22.060
Was he my father?

24:24.531 --> 24:26.565
Course, he was,
sweetie.

24:28.535 --> 24:31.036
The police had us in
for questioning today.

24:32.539 --> 24:34.072
Who's "us"?

24:34.074 --> 24:36.408
Me, Pope, and Deran.

24:36.410 --> 24:39.077
And where's Craig?

24:39.079 --> 24:40.879
We don't know
where Craig is.

24:40.881 --> 24:42.414
Deran says maybe Mexico,

24:42.416 --> 24:45.350
but he's not answering
his phone, so...

24:45.352 --> 24:48.553
What did you tell the police?

24:48.555 --> 24:52.224
There was nothing to tell.

24:55.896 --> 24:59.364
J, baby, you remember
that work you did with Baz,

24:59.366 --> 25:01.800
moving the things
from my storage unit?

25:03.637 --> 25:06.571
Well, I thought I knew
where Baz put those things,

25:06.573 --> 25:11.309
but... they're not
where I thought they were.

25:15.449 --> 25:18.317
Do you have my things,
Joshua?

25:19.720 --> 25:21.053
No.

25:23.858 --> 25:28.193
You know how important it is
not to lie to your grandmother?

25:28.195 --> 25:30.729
Yes.

25:30.731 --> 25:33.665
But...

25:33.667 --> 25:35.701
I don't know
where Baz put your things.

26:07.434 --> 26:09.634
What are you doing here?

26:09.636 --> 26:12.036
Seeing Smurf.

26:12.038 --> 26:14.172
Why?

26:14.174 --> 26:17.242
Just checking
to see if she was okay.

26:17.244 --> 26:18.610
And?

26:20.180 --> 26:22.247
Is she okay?

26:25.786 --> 26:29.788
All broke up about Baz?

26:29.790 --> 26:32.791
Gonna cry herself
to sleep?

26:32.793 --> 26:36.662
Rend her garments,
tear at her flesh?

26:39.066 --> 26:40.632
Get in.

26:42.136 --> 26:44.136
I drove.

26:44.138 --> 26:45.738
We can
come back for it later.

26:50.744 --> 26:52.477
Nah, you won't need
your gun.

26:56.283 --> 26:57.482
Where are we going,
Pope?

26:57.484 --> 27:01.153
It's almost 4:00.

27:01.155 --> 27:04.423
We got to pick up Lena
from school.

27:19.506 --> 27:22.307
Thanks for the ice cream.

27:22.309 --> 27:24.843
You're welcome.

27:24.845 --> 27:27.346
Your, uh...

27:29.116 --> 27:31.183
Your dad...

27:32.987 --> 27:34.787
He, uh...

27:38.125 --> 27:40.058
He had to take a trip.

27:40.060 --> 27:43.128
When is he coming back?

27:43.130 --> 27:47.466
I'm not sure.

27:47.468 --> 27:50.602
Maybe, uh...

27:52.473 --> 27:54.273
Maybe never.

27:56.010 --> 27:58.743
Did he go to find my mom?

27:58.745 --> 28:01.347
I don't know.

28:02.949 --> 28:05.083
Am I gonna have to move?

28:05.085 --> 28:06.151
What?

28:06.153 --> 28:09.021
I like my room
at my house.

28:09.023 --> 28:11.824
I can hear the ocean.

28:15.696 --> 28:17.896
You can live
at your house.

28:17.898 --> 28:18.963
By myself?

28:18.965 --> 28:19.898
No.

28:19.900 --> 28:23.968
I could
stay there with you.

28:23.970 --> 28:29.508
I mean, if...
that's all right with you.

28:29.510 --> 28:32.044
That would be okay.

28:32.046 --> 28:34.513
Good.

28:37.117 --> 28:38.751
Are you crying?

28:40.921 --> 28:42.587
It's okay.

28:42.589 --> 28:44.989
You don't have to cry.

28:44.991 --> 28:46.991
My house is nice.

28:59.606 --> 29:02.140
Who the hell is that?

29:02.142 --> 29:03.876
I don't know.

29:08.749 --> 29:12.350
Stay with Lena.

29:16.823 --> 29:18.623
She showed up
a couple minutes ago.

29:18.625 --> 29:20.158
I was about
to give you a call.

29:20.160 --> 29:22.227
Who showed up?

29:43.450 --> 29:45.751
Is he really dead?

29:46.921 --> 29:49.254
Were you there?

29:49.256 --> 29:51.323
I couldn't stay.

29:51.325 --> 29:52.825
The cops were coming.

29:54.795 --> 29:56.461
Did you see who did it?

29:56.463 --> 29:58.864
It all happened too fast.

30:01.668 --> 30:04.536
Oh, God,
I can't believe Baz is dead.

30:04.538 --> 30:06.404
My dad's dead?

30:22.356 --> 30:24.657
Come on.

31:03.530 --> 31:05.798
Let it go.

31:09.203 --> 31:11.003
It's not worth it.

32:02.456 --> 32:03.856
Wait,
what did you say to 'em?

32:03.858 --> 32:05.323
- We paid up?
- Gracias.

32:05.325 --> 32:07.259
I told him you were
a mixed martial arts expert

32:07.261 --> 32:09.061
that could kill him
with his bare hands.

32:09.063 --> 32:11.196
No, seriously.
What did you just tell 'em? Now... No.

32:11.198 --> 32:12.731
They're laughing at us!

32:12.733 --> 32:14.933
Not us, you.

32:14.935 --> 32:17.202
Craig!
- I just wanted to have some fun.

32:17.204 --> 32:18.603
You were about
to get your ass kicked.

32:18.605 --> 32:19.872
I just offered them
a drink.

32:19.874 --> 32:21.473
Keys.

32:23.944 --> 32:25.144
I don't want to go yet.

32:26.947 --> 32:28.613
Keys.

32:36.623 --> 32:38.891
Aw, come on!

32:38.893 --> 32:40.926
Nothing
was gonna happen.

32:42.897 --> 32:47.099
You want to stay?
Fine.

32:47.101 --> 32:49.968
Call me in the morning from some
shitty Mexican hospital.

32:49.970 --> 32:51.503
Maybe I'll come pick up
what's left of you.

32:51.505 --> 32:52.771
Oh, yeah?

33:13.527 --> 33:14.659
Your phone.

33:14.661 --> 33:15.794
What?

33:15.796 --> 33:17.896
It's your phone.

33:22.669 --> 33:23.668
Jesus.

33:23.670 --> 33:25.237
What?

33:26.873 --> 33:28.140
Baz.

33:31.411 --> 33:33.278
He's dead.

34:08.114 --> 34:14.386
If it wasn't Lucy
or Javi's crew,

34:14.388 --> 34:18.056
then it was Smurf,
which means it was you, too.

34:20.127 --> 34:21.327
Shh.

34:24.531 --> 34:27.866
I'm gonna find out
who killed my brother...

34:27.868 --> 34:30.936
no matter how long
it takes.

34:33.940 --> 34:38.077
And when I do...
I'ma kill 'em.

34:55.396 --> 34:58.597
When is the funeral?

35:02.403 --> 35:05.670
Cops won't release the body
till after the autopsy.

35:08.141 --> 35:10.175
They're gonna
cut him up?

35:21.755 --> 35:23.489
Who?

35:25.158 --> 35:27.559
- Who shot him?
- We... We don't know.

35:32.032 --> 35:35.901
We can't let them
cut him up, man.

35:40.441 --> 35:42.508
Son of a bitch!

35:43.510 --> 35:47.112
Ohh, Jesus.

36:49.776 --> 36:52.344
You give us a moment?

36:58.852 --> 37:00.652
Terrible.

37:00.654 --> 37:03.789
Horrible thing for a mother
to lose their child.

37:04.792 --> 37:08.259
Course, Baz wasn't really
your son, was he?

37:08.261 --> 37:12.063
Gosh.
I always forget that.

37:12.065 --> 37:14.399
But I guess
with all of Pope's troubles,

37:14.401 --> 37:16.535
you needed Baz around
to hold him together.

37:16.537 --> 37:20.039
It's gonna be tough on Pope
without Baz.

37:25.146 --> 37:27.412
What do you want,
Detective?

37:27.414 --> 37:30.049
I want you to give up
your boys.

37:31.618 --> 37:34.687
Give them up, maybe we could
work something out.

37:35.756 --> 37:37.356
What do you have in mind?

37:37.358 --> 37:40.091
Craig does 5 to 10
for that armed robbery

37:40.093 --> 37:41.760
at the Savings and Loan
in Riverside.

37:41.762 --> 37:44.896
Deran pleads to grand theft
for that smash-and-grab

37:44.898 --> 37:46.565
at the South Coast Plaza.

37:46.567 --> 37:49.968
That was your boys,
right?

37:49.970 --> 37:53.572
I'll recommend Deran does a
couple of years somewhere easy.

37:53.574 --> 37:57.108
I'll take a pass
on your grandson J.

37:57.110 --> 37:58.710
He deserves a break

37:58.712 --> 38:01.847
after what you let happen
to his mother.

38:01.849 --> 38:04.916
What happens to Andrew?

38:04.918 --> 38:06.718
Pope?

38:06.720 --> 38:09.788
Well, we both know
that Pope needs to be put away

38:09.790 --> 38:13.258
before he has the chance
to hurt more people.

38:13.260 --> 38:14.926
We'll all rest easier

38:14.928 --> 38:18.329
knowing that Pope's behind bars
for the rest of his life.

38:18.331 --> 38:20.131
Especially you.

38:20.133 --> 38:23.402
And what about me?

38:23.404 --> 38:25.304
You'll have to do
real time.

38:26.607 --> 38:28.540
10 to 20.

38:30.010 --> 38:32.010
But three of your sons

38:32.012 --> 38:35.680
will get a chance
to get on with their lives

38:35.682 --> 38:37.749
and not end up
in a refrigerated drawer

38:37.751 --> 38:40.652
at the County Coroner's
next to Baz.

38:43.090 --> 38:46.225
I'd take it, Smurf.

38:46.227 --> 38:49.160
What if I don't?

38:49.162 --> 38:53.164
I nail you, and I get your boys
to roll on each other.

38:53.166 --> 38:54.633
Never gonna happen.

38:57.037 --> 38:59.704
With Baz gone
and you in here,

38:59.706 --> 39:03.175
your boys are gonna fall apart
like a cheap suit, so...

39:07.180 --> 39:08.914
You had a good run,
Janine.

39:08.916 --> 39:11.450
Better than most.

39:15.188 --> 39:17.056
But time's up.

39:29.336 --> 39:31.070
What are you doing?

39:37.077 --> 39:39.578
I'm so sorry about Lena.

39:41.815 --> 39:45.617
Did you get Baz into something
he shouldn't have been into?

39:45.619 --> 39:46.652
No.

39:47.955 --> 39:51.090
You screwing
someone else?

39:51.092 --> 39:54.359
You got
another boyfriend?

39:54.361 --> 39:56.761
Some jealous sicario
find out

39:56.763 --> 40:00.231
he was sharing time between
your legs with my brother?

40:09.776 --> 40:13.044
I know you never
believed it,

40:13.046 --> 40:16.248
but I loved your brother.

40:17.784 --> 40:22.521
I was always in love
with Baz... since I was 16.

40:22.523 --> 40:25.724
Okay?

40:25.726 --> 40:28.393
Smurf kept us apart,

40:28.395 --> 40:31.363
but I never stopped
loving him.

40:32.933 --> 40:34.599
Ever.

41:23.450 --> 41:24.916
You got it?

41:24.918 --> 41:26.518
It's all there.

41:34.061 --> 41:35.594
What's your name?

41:35.596 --> 41:38.263
Next week,
same time, same place.

42:11.765 --> 42:14.400
So, you're really going
back down to Mexico, huh?

42:16.237 --> 42:18.470
Nothing here
for me anymore, man.

42:20.707 --> 42:22.173
I'm gonna try
and make a new start

42:22.175 --> 42:23.909
down there with Renn.

42:25.246 --> 42:27.178
You don't even speak Spanish.

42:27.180 --> 42:29.581
Renn does.
She can teach me.

42:37.925 --> 42:42.327
Shit's just got...
too heavy.

42:42.329 --> 42:44.330
You know?

42:46.267 --> 42:47.466
Yeah.

42:47.468 --> 42:52.737
You've got
your own thing now, and...

42:52.739 --> 42:57.309
just figured I need
to find something for me.

43:05.419 --> 43:07.552
Thanks.

43:07.554 --> 43:08.921
It's time.

43:10.291 --> 43:12.091
What's up?

43:13.305 --> 43:19.636
