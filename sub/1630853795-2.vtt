13:14.919 --> 13:17.546

13:17.630 --> 13:20.674
and toxic,
and not a good person.

13:20.758 --> 13:24.261
She put an innocent
animal inside a tank,

13:24.345 --> 13:25.930
and then turned
that tank into a vacuum.

13:26.013 --> 13:30.226
It died an excruciating death
while she filmed it.

13:30.309 --> 13:33.729

She... is a horrible
human being.

13:33.812 --> 13:37.525

hateful, privileged,

13:37.608 --> 13:40.236

being all those things

something to stop her.

Asshole!

25:55.762 --> 25:57.597
After I grabbed Tyler's phone,

25:57.681 --> 25:59.683
I handed you off to Kelly.

I made sure that you
were safe before I left.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.151
I lost my virginity to Greg.

26:11.611 --> 26:13.530
And the next thing
I heard was...

26:15.073 --> 26:16.950
he was kissing my best friend.

26:18.535 --> 26:20.245
That's why you were so pissed.

26:20.328 --> 26:21.955
You know what I've
been thinking about?

26:23.873 --> 26:25.125
How you saved that video.

26:25.208 --> 26:27.544
You could've deleted it.

26:29.254 --> 26:32.090
You could've thrown
the phone in the lake,
but you kept it.

26:34.217 --> 26:35.260
Why?

26:36.678 --> 26:39.472
Because you knew
one day you'd be able
to use it to hurt me.

26:41.349 --> 26:43.476
That's the only possible reason.

26:46.021 --> 26:49.190
You're not a good person.

26:49.274 --> 26:53.236

have put razor blades
in your own shoes

When I brought up
the things that she did,

28:19.239 --> 28:22.200
-she completely denied them.
-Of course, she did.

I did.

30:19.025 --> 30:20.527
I was...

30:20.610 --> 30:22.779
jealous, and...

30:22.862 --> 30:23.821
I felt threatened
by them, and...

I'm so, so sorry,
Principal Clanton.

30:42.131 --> 30:42.757
in my heart of hearts...

30:45.301 --> 30:47.762
that Imogen deserves
to be Spirit Queen.

31:20.336 --> 31:22.964

31:23.047 --> 31:25.800
what did Clanton say?
Did he recognize you?

31:26.718 --> 31:26.759
No.

31:28.845 --> 31:29.971
He completely thought I was you.

31:32.724 --> 31:36.644

and Miss Hayworth an apology.

the posters herself.

-What? Really?
-Yes.

32:41.334 --> 32:44.712
And I assure you,
she will be punished
accordingly.

32:44.796 --> 32:45.922

32:46.005 --> 32:49.008

in contention...

32:49.092 --> 32:52.011
you will be crowned
Spirit Queen at the dance.
