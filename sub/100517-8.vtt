WEBVTT

02:20.140 --> 02:21.808
What the fuck?

02:34.028 --> 02:35.280
Drop the weapon.

02:37.448 --> 02:38.783
You heard the man.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.371
I come in peace.

02:43.454 --> 02:44.873
All evidence to the contrary.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.709
How the fuck are you still alive?

02:48.209 --> 02:49.085
Guess I got lucky.

02:49.502 --> 02:52.797
Bullshit. Last we saw,
you were smoldering on the ground.

02:53.339 --> 02:56.259
Do not trust this scoundrel.
He brought these jackboots upon us.

02:56.342 --> 02:58.261
He attacked Miss Dig.

02:58.636 --> 03:01.890
You're not easy to find.
I used the the AI to track you.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.894
-I knew I'd be there to take care of it.
- Were you expecting a thank you?

03:05.977 --> 03:09.772
Enough. The Protectorate knows we're here.
We need to move out.

03:10.565 --> 03:12.066
-All of us.
- He's Jaeger's man.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.610
He's safer with a bullet in his head.

03:13.693 --> 03:15.987
Is that what I should've done to you
on the bridge that day?

03:16.070 --> 03:17.405
Put a bullet in your head?

03:21.201 --> 03:22.243
Come on, let's go.

03:28.750 --> 03:33.087
Take TJ to Shira's and wait for me.
Tell her we need to disappear.

03:33.171 --> 03:34.172
What about you?

03:34.255 --> 03:35.173
Hey.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.175
It's okay.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.303
I'm right behind you, sweetie.

03:40.845 --> 03:41.763
All right?

03:46.601 --> 03:47.435
I won't be long.

03:48.019 --> 03:48.978
Don't be.

03:57.528 --> 03:58.529
What the hell's that?

03:58.613 --> 04:02.242
No need to panic. It is just the construct
appears to be empty.

04:02.575 --> 04:04.786
-You said you had it contained.
-We did.

04:04.869 --> 04:08.748
-That does not sound good.
-The Elder, it found a way out.

04:09.207 --> 04:11.292
What do you mean "the Elder"?

04:11.376 --> 04:14.003
It was there in VR.
It's what invaded Quell's stack.

04:14.087 --> 04:17.298
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.
-Even if that is true,

04:17.548 --> 04:19.968
the firewall was finished.
Miss Dig sealed it completely.

04:20.051 --> 04:21.886
Someone must've opened a door.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.931
Jaeger. He was there inside the construct.

04:25.348 --> 04:27.850
We used his signal
to find your server in the real.

04:28.393 --> 04:29.936
We have to track him down.

04:30.019 --> 04:31.813
-And shoot him.
- You can't.

04:31.896 --> 04:33.731
It'll just invade the nearest stack.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.734
The upgrades on that Wedge sleeve
won't give it much time,

04:36.818 --> 04:38.695
-but it could be enough.
-Enough for what?

04:39.612 --> 04:42.156
Enough to access Angelfire and unleash it.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.911
Protectorate just issued an order.
Squad's on the way.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.830
-I'm getting it too.
-We need to go.

04:48.913 --> 04:51.666
Where?
The Nevermore's burned thanks to him.

04:51.749 --> 04:53.209
We'll go to my dad's.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.212
You all can resupply there.
We'll stick to the alleys.

05:00.591 --> 05:01.467
You coming?

05:07.348 --> 05:08.599
Search the Array.

05:08.683 --> 05:12.145
Find out who's paying the Renouncers
to lie about Konrad Harlan.

05:12.228 --> 05:14.355
We might need him before this is all over.

05:14.897 --> 05:16.149
How will I find you?

05:16.649 --> 05:18.192
I'll keep you tethered.

05:39.380 --> 05:42.091
Governor, I'm not sure
how much you remember.

05:42.175 --> 05:45.303
I installed your latest backup
and it's--

05:45.386 --> 05:49.015
Oh, I remember. You snuck off
like a coward and left me to get shot!

05:49.432 --> 05:51.726
And I'm guessing
you let my attackers escape.

05:51.809 --> 05:53.102
Their Envoy half-blinded me.

05:55.313 --> 05:58.524
I'd advise you save your anger
for a more appropriate target.

05:58.983 --> 06:01.486
Your colonel came out of VR
and went on a rampage.

06:01.569 --> 06:04.530
Killed every tech in the barracks,
wiped their backups too.

06:05.406 --> 06:09.619
He also cleaned out an entire store
of sleeve reacclimation drugs.

06:11.621 --> 06:12.872
Where is he now?

06:50.868 --> 06:52.578
Tsk, tsk, Colonel.

06:53.204 --> 06:55.248
Stealing is against the law.

06:55.331 --> 06:56.916
Even for you.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.085
You want to talk...

07:02.171 --> 07:03.339
about justice?

07:06.050 --> 07:07.093
Your kind...

07:08.928 --> 07:10.680
descended like vultures...

07:11.848 --> 07:14.016
-...to pick our bones.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.037
I thought
we were sticking to the alleys.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.497
Is there no other way?

07:37.540 --> 07:40.460
Stay here.
I'll do some recon, make sure it's safe.

07:41.002 --> 07:41.878
I'll go with you.

07:44.755 --> 07:46.090
-Quell--
-Don't.

07:46.174 --> 07:48.009
Letting the Elder out was too big a risk.

07:48.092 --> 07:50.386
I made a call
and I'll do it again to save you.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.929
That's what I'm afraid of.

07:52.013 --> 07:55.016
It isn't the first time your feelings
for me have led to a body count.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.685
This is about Stronghold.

07:58.186 --> 08:01.606
If I hadn't stumbled upon your camp,
Rei would have never betrayed us.

08:01.689 --> 08:04.358
It's both of us.
We are the problem.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.196
What are you saying?

08:09.071 --> 08:11.866
Getting close to you was my mistake.

08:12.742 --> 08:13.951
I won't make it again.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.831
Let's go. Just keep your heads down.

08:36.641 --> 08:37.475
This is it.

08:39.101 --> 08:42.688
-It's no good. The patrols.
- Relax, it'll just be a minute.

08:45.274 --> 08:47.568
-It's not locked.
- They've been here already.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.195
Like I said, we should keep going.

08:55.076 --> 08:55.952
Dad?

08:58.788 --> 08:59.747
No!

09:00.540 --> 09:01.499
Dad!

09:03.000 --> 09:03.918
Dad.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.921
It's okay, we can spin him back up.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.549
His stack...

09:10.216 --> 09:12.009
-they ripped it.
-We'll find it.

09:12.969 --> 09:14.053
It has to be here.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.853
You tracked us to Stronghold.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.274
-You stopped here on the way.
- Trepp.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.281
No.

09:35.449 --> 09:36.909
No.

09:43.541 --> 09:47.003
You were sloppy.
You scrubbed the AI but left the metadata.

09:47.086 --> 09:50.881
You're not used to it, are you?
Dealing with consequences.

09:52.508 --> 09:54.677
Sir, I hacked
the Renouncers' credit holdings.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.888
Concealed behind several false fronts
is a name I suspect you already know.

09:57.972 --> 09:58.848
Danica...

10:00.224 --> 10:02.602
-Oh, no.
- Poe!

10:03.561 --> 10:04.395
Later.

10:04.478 --> 10:07.231
My father told me to stay the hell away
from all of you.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.442
Wasn't this your Protectorate friends?
Hmm?

10:09.525 --> 10:11.819
Did you know what they did to him?

10:14.447 --> 10:16.240
All of you get out.

10:16.866 --> 10:17.908
Now!

10:17.992 --> 10:19.577
You're right to be angry,

10:19.660 --> 10:22.288
but you saw that fire come down.
Jaeger is out here.

10:22.371 --> 10:24.665
Let him torch
the whole  goddamn city!

10:25.666 --> 10:27.418
I don't give a fuck about your cause!

10:27.918 --> 10:30.880
I was in this for my brother
and he is gone.

10:31.797 --> 10:34.759
My father's stack is in pieces.

10:35.259 --> 10:37.178
Our business here is done.

10:41.390 --> 10:42.308
Leave.

10:44.727 --> 10:45.686
Leave!

11:01.118 --> 11:02.870
-What now?
- We find Jaeger.

11:02.953 --> 11:04.747
It won't work. You said yourself,

11:04.830 --> 11:06.832
the Elder will just invade
the nearest stack.

11:06.916 --> 11:10.002
- You got a better idea?
-We give it what it wants.

11:10.461 --> 11:12.129
Keep up your end of the bargain.

11:12.213 --> 11:16.717
Danica Harlan's been paying Renouncers
to say Konrad's one of them, but he's not.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.552
Which means she knows where he is.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.805
-You wanna confront her?
- I'm done running.

11:21.305 --> 11:25.309
The sky is literally about to fall,
and I've got nothing left to lose.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.730
All right, Tak. What's your play?

11:31.273 --> 11:32.983
We go in the front door.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.669
<i>Fugitives approaching.</i>
<i>Clear the way.</i>

11:56.841 --> 11:58.718
Takeshi Kovacs.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.095
Both of you this time.

12:05.433 --> 12:06.934
I believe I owe you a bullet.

12:07.017 --> 12:09.103
That's a bad way to start a negotiation.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.564
Your message said this was surrender.

12:12.022 --> 12:15.025
The only reason you agreed to our terms
is because you know the truth.

12:15.526 --> 12:16.777
Your world is in danger.

12:17.903 --> 12:19.655
Quellcrist Falconer.

12:20.906 --> 12:25.745
I see you've taken up your old mantle.
Don't you know The Uprising isn't real?

12:25.828 --> 12:27.079
It is now.

12:31.667 --> 12:34.545
My father's stories don't do you justice.

12:34.628 --> 12:38.215
Then again,
he always did underestimate women.

12:39.550 --> 12:40.509
Not me.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.304
I've seen what you can do.

12:43.387 --> 12:46.307
The only ones who can control the Orbitals
are the ones who built them.

12:46.390 --> 12:48.392
-Elders are extinct.
- Not quite.

12:49.435 --> 12:50.561
Ask your colonel.

12:51.353 --> 12:52.813
Not acting like himself, is he?

12:54.565 --> 12:56.358
What do you know about Carrera?

12:56.442 --> 13:00.279
It's not him you need to worry about.
It's the Elder stuck in his stack.

13:01.113 --> 13:03.365
He wants revenge for what your father did.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.201
And it will use Carrera to get it.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.995
Do you hear yourselves?
You've lost your minds.

13:08.078 --> 13:11.248
Maybe. But to save Harlan's World,
we need Konrad.

13:12.166 --> 13:15.002
-My father's with the Renouncers.
- That's a lie!

13:15.085 --> 13:17.963
Everything on these walls is a lie.

13:18.047 --> 13:21.967
When that Colony ship touched down,
there were Elders here and he killed them!

13:22.092 --> 13:23.928
What you're talking about
is ancient history.

13:24.011 --> 13:28.182
When Konrad opened fire, the Songspire
copied the consciousness of an Elder,

13:28.265 --> 13:29.266
stored it.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.811
-That's ridiculous.
- Is it?

13:31.894 --> 13:34.021
We don't know how Elder technology works.

13:34.104 --> 13:36.232
The Founders
must answer for their crime

13:36.857 --> 13:39.235
or that forest won't be the only thing
that burns.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.862
And how could you possibly know that?

13:43.113 --> 13:45.699
Because before the Elder
was in Carrera's stack...

13:48.035 --> 13:49.328
it was in mine.

14:00.798 --> 14:04.844
The noble heroes want to feed my father
to the monster.

14:10.140 --> 14:12.726
Go ahead, he's yours.

14:15.271 --> 14:16.355
There's nothing left.

14:17.606 --> 14:20.526
-His backups.
-You're a woman of vision, Miss Falconer.

14:20.609 --> 14:22.736
You understand the lengths one must go to.

14:23.153 --> 14:23.988
It was coup.

14:24.488 --> 14:27.074
My father was too afraid
of the Protectorate.

14:27.157 --> 14:30.411
He gave in to their insatiable demand
for alloy.

14:30.953 --> 14:33.247
And at the rate he was going,
he'd have nothing left.

14:33.330 --> 14:36.792
You manufactured a war in my name.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.586
You said make it personal.

14:38.669 --> 14:39.712
I did.

14:40.379 --> 14:43.757
I sacrificed family,
stood up to the Protectorate.

14:44.341 --> 14:45.759
You should be proud.

14:47.803 --> 14:50.764
I do miss him now and then,
that's why I keep him close.

14:51.640 --> 14:55.060
Maybe I'll put your stacks next to his.
Guards!

14:58.522 --> 15:02.359
You want Angelfire to overthrow
the Protectorate? It's yours.

15:03.319 --> 15:04.320
How?

15:04.403 --> 15:07.448
The Elder almost destroyed us both
when it fired the Orbitals.

15:08.198 --> 15:09.700
But it learns from experience.

15:10.826 --> 15:14.455
<i>It knows now that it needs</i>
<i>something external to give it a boost.</i>

15:16.206 --> 15:20.002
<i>It will fuse its technology with ours</i>
<i>to control the Orbitals</i>

15:20.878 --> 15:23.255
<i>without destroying the sleeve it's in.</i>

15:26.383 --> 15:28.844
With that device in your hand...

15:30.971 --> 15:33.474
you control Angelfire.

15:34.475 --> 15:35.726
Thanks for the tip.

15:36.810 --> 15:39.563
But I don't need you to kill Carrera
and take it.

15:39.647 --> 15:42.441
Killing it is not the solution.
It's a ghost.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.902
Anger is what holds it together.

15:45.402 --> 15:47.613
We offer it Konrad's stack,

15:47.696 --> 15:51.742
let it see that its vengeance is complete
so it can rest.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.787
And what do you get in return?

15:54.870 --> 15:56.789
Safe transport off planet.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.584
You're not the only one that wants
to bring the Protectorate down.

16:02.336 --> 16:03.754
We're on the same side.

16:10.177 --> 16:11.637
This is clearly a bad time.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.806
-The Orbitals?
-What about them?

16:15.349 --> 16:16.892
They are moving.

16:29.863 --> 16:31.365
<i>People of Millsport,</i>

16:31.865 --> 16:34.243
<i>a mandatory curfew is now in effect.</i>

16:34.743 --> 16:38.914
<i>All citizens should immediately</i>
<i>seek shelter and remain indoors.</i>

16:40.332 --> 16:43.961
<i>I repeat, all citizens</i>
<i>should immediately seek shelter</i>

16:44.044 --> 16:46.046
<i>and remain indoors.</i>

16:48.465 --> 16:51.427
Why waste time moving the Orbitals?
One would do plenty of damage.

16:51.510 --> 16:54.096
The Elder doesn't wanna do damage,
it wants mass destruction.

16:54.763 --> 16:56.724
Wherever they come together,
Jaeger will be there.

16:57.224 --> 16:59.101
Poe, try and figure out
the point of convergence.

16:59.184 --> 17:00.978
I should have the deduction
for you shortly.

17:02.479 --> 17:04.106
What you said back there,

17:04.189 --> 17:06.483
I get the whole
"keep your enemy close" thing,

17:06.817 --> 17:08.986
-but giving her Angelfire--
-It won't come to that.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.320
How do you know?

17:10.404 --> 17:13.282
What if Konrad's fragged stack
doesn't satisfy it?

17:13.365 --> 17:16.452
-What if we can't even get close?
-Why don't you for once trust her plan?

17:16.535 --> 17:18.037
Because she taught me better.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.080
Someone has to ask questions.

17:20.164 --> 17:22.833
What's your alternative, Tak?
Because I don't see one.

17:24.543 --> 17:25.377
Trepp.

17:25.794 --> 17:28.672
In the forest,
her coils connected with the Orbital.

17:29.214 --> 17:32.259
Maybe she could disrupt the signal,
buy us some time to get close to Jaeger.

17:32.342 --> 17:34.470
Well, that's great, but Trepp's not here.

17:34.636 --> 17:38.766
-Go. See if you can convince her.
- She's more likely to shoot him.

17:40.851 --> 17:41.810
I'll do it.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.899
So what, you a good soldier now?

17:47.524 --> 17:49.818
You might be willing
to walk through fire for her,

17:49.902 --> 17:52.488
but if you wanna prove yourself,
you'll follow my lead.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.907
You think because you lived longer
that makes you wise?

17:54.990 --> 17:56.617
You've never watched her die.

17:58.285 --> 18:01.789
Send me the coordinates
when you have them. I'll meet you there.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.465
I did my part.
The people of Millsport are tucked away.

18:11.548 --> 18:12.674
What about yours?

18:12.758 --> 18:14.802
Poe, the Orbitals?

18:20.849 --> 18:22.976
I'm sorry. What was the question?

18:24.019 --> 18:26.522
You were calculating
the point of convergence.

18:26.605 --> 18:27.689
The Orbitals.

18:28.398 --> 18:29.274
I--

18:29.942 --> 18:30.776
Is this normal?

18:30.859 --> 18:32.986
No. Well, kinda.

18:33.487 --> 18:34.321
Poe!

18:34.655 --> 18:37.366
Sorry, I just seem to have lost
my train of--

18:47.292 --> 18:48.252
Excuse me.

18:52.089 --> 18:54.633
Stone, try and be useful.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.275
Miss Dig.

19:12.693 --> 19:16.321
You believed my mind could be healed.

19:21.535 --> 19:23.036
Now I need your faith.

19:26.748 --> 19:27.875
Hello, Eddie.

19:34.298 --> 19:35.465
Miss Elizabeth.

19:36.508 --> 19:40.596
Or is this another delusion?

19:41.138 --> 19:42.389
I'm not really her.

19:43.265 --> 19:46.476
I'm a program designed to extract
and preserve data.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.396
Dig 301 thought
you might need a friendly face

19:49.479 --> 19:51.273
when you arrived at this precipice.

19:55.152 --> 19:56.028
Please...

19:57.529 --> 20:00.240
it's my glitch, it's overtaking me.

20:03.577 --> 20:06.622
If you would just hold me together
long enough to keep them alive,

20:07.206 --> 20:11.835
and then you may do with my mind
what you will.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.254
Is that a command?

20:19.259 --> 20:20.385
Very well.

20:31.438 --> 20:32.856
The damage is extensive.

20:33.857 --> 20:35.025
A real challenge.

20:35.692 --> 20:37.694
I'll need to reconfigure the algorithms.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.989
-How long will that take?
-It's not easy, Poe.

20:41.698 --> 20:43.408
I have to wipe everything.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.662
It's going to feel like dying.

20:48.705 --> 20:50.374
I'll let you know when it's time.

20:52.584 --> 20:53.752
Miss Elizabeth...

21:02.552 --> 21:03.887
please come back.

21:06.473 --> 21:07.641
It's no use.

21:07.724 --> 21:09.935
There you are.
I've been looking for you.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.604
If you're gonna brood...

21:16.441 --> 21:17.943
you may as well drink.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.113
Sir...

21:22.155 --> 21:25.575
-if you're going to chastise--
-It's too late for that, isn't it?

21:27.828 --> 21:28.662
You...

21:29.538 --> 21:30.706
are shutting down.

21:33.250 --> 21:34.209
Yes.

21:36.336 --> 21:37.504
All these years,

21:38.588 --> 21:42.426
I've clung to memories
even when they've brought pain,

21:42.509 --> 21:44.845
peril upon myself and others.

21:44.928 --> 21:45.887
Been there.

21:46.596 --> 21:51.893
And despite my best efforts,
everything is still slipping away.

21:52.352 --> 21:53.353
I've done that.

21:56.398 --> 21:57.357
Time.

22:01.028 --> 22:04.740
Time is what's thwarted me, hmm.

22:09.536 --> 22:11.455
I am going to die.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.417
Just broken...

22:19.880 --> 22:21.506
and of no use to anyone.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.010
Well, congratulations.

22:26.136 --> 22:28.930
You've finally figured out
what it means to be alive.

22:30.974 --> 22:32.601
We're all broken, Poe.

22:34.936 --> 22:36.897
There's nothing more human than that.

22:39.441 --> 22:40.317
Oh.

22:45.113 --> 22:46.239
Miss Falconer.

22:47.491 --> 22:51.119
Your journey brought you to Miss Falconer.

22:52.537 --> 22:53.955
You found each other.

22:56.416 --> 22:58.335
And see what good that did.

23:00.337 --> 23:01.421
I wanted us...

23:03.382 --> 23:04.841
to have a life.

23:07.302 --> 23:08.345
But it looks like...

23:11.431 --> 23:14.142
it's just me, you, and misery.

23:25.904 --> 23:28.365
Your second chance
may not be what you envisioned.

23:29.324 --> 23:32.744
But if you're too stubborn to accept it,
then you are right.

23:34.121 --> 23:36.081
You do not deserve it.

23:42.671 --> 23:45.632
- What are you doing?
-Tracking Orbitals.

23:46.133 --> 23:49.136
I will not squander what little time
I have left.

23:55.934 --> 23:57.519
And as your friend,

23:58.478 --> 23:59.688
I entreat you...

24:01.481 --> 24:02.941
to not squander yours.

24:37.434 --> 24:38.768
You were right.

24:39.853 --> 24:42.606
I'm shortsighted when it comes to you,
but you...

24:43.773 --> 24:44.900
you see it all.

24:53.408 --> 24:55.160
I can't change what I've done,

24:56.077 --> 24:57.078
but I'm here,

24:58.580 --> 25:00.081
whatever way you need.

25:00.957 --> 25:02.751
Even if you can't say the same.

25:08.006 --> 25:11.885
I've trained myself to see every detail
and somehow...

25:14.930 --> 25:16.223
I never see you coming.

25:18.683 --> 25:22.479
You're a crack in my armor,
one I can't afford, but...

25:26.441 --> 25:30.278
when I was buried so deep in my stack,
I didn't even know who I was,

25:30.362 --> 25:32.989
you gave me the strength to break free.

25:35.033 --> 25:36.034
Tak...

25:42.749 --> 25:45.544
I risked the Settled Worlds
to touch you again.

25:49.422 --> 25:51.299
I've seen that look before.

25:53.468 --> 25:55.512
That last night at the lake,

25:56.555 --> 25:58.181
when you told me your real name.

25:59.474 --> 26:00.892
Nadia Makita.

26:04.688 --> 26:07.607
Only reason you told me
was because you weren't coming back.

26:10.777 --> 26:12.487
You're doing it again, aren't you?

26:15.532 --> 26:17.158
I trained you too well.

26:21.955 --> 26:23.540
So what's the real plan?

26:24.291 --> 26:25.542
If I have to,

26:26.459 --> 26:27.627
I kill Jaeger,

26:28.253 --> 26:29.713
force the Elder back into me.

26:30.630 --> 26:32.507
And when our minds are intertwined,

26:32.591 --> 26:35.176
I can control the Orbital
like I did before.

26:35.260 --> 26:37.220
-And then what?
-And then...

26:38.054 --> 26:39.806
I bring the fire back on the Elder.

26:40.765 --> 26:41.641
And myself.

26:43.184 --> 26:45.770
-No!
-This is why I waited to tell you.

26:45.854 --> 26:48.315
Why is your solution always
fix it and die?

26:48.398 --> 26:51.318
Life has to have limits
or we're not human anymore.

26:51.818 --> 26:54.863
I created stacks.
If someone has to pay for the wrong

26:54.946 --> 26:57.157
done to the Elders, it should be me.

26:58.116 --> 27:00.368
You just wanted to see the stars.

27:00.452 --> 27:03.079
We are more than the sum
of our intentions.

27:03.371 --> 27:04.998
I have to make it right.

27:07.375 --> 27:08.376
Tak...

27:10.378 --> 27:11.588
I do love you.

27:16.009 --> 27:18.928
I wish you loved me enough to live.

28:09.729 --> 28:11.189
I need to see Trepp.

28:11.648 --> 28:13.566
I don't know who the fuck
you're talking about.

28:16.695 --> 28:17.946
It's okay, Shira.

28:20.156 --> 28:21.533
Give me a minute.

28:22.450 --> 28:24.327
Tell Myka and TJ I'll be right there.

28:31.626 --> 28:35.130
You just couldn't leave well enough alone?
I told you, I'm out.

28:35.213 --> 28:37.173
That was before the Orbitals
started moving.

28:37.257 --> 28:39.968
No one will survive this,
not you, not your family.

28:40.051 --> 28:42.554
Then I will spend my last moments
with them!

28:42.637 --> 28:45.056
You locked onto the signal.
You could find a way to jam it.

28:45.140 --> 28:49.394
You think my coils
are a match for an Orbital?

28:50.019 --> 28:53.565
It's like a drop in the ocean.
Nothing I do will make a difference.

28:56.443 --> 28:58.403
It's not what your father believed.

29:00.488 --> 29:02.824
He traded his life for your future.

29:05.201 --> 29:06.786
He was brave until his last moment.

29:07.704 --> 29:08.788
He never gave you up.

29:11.416 --> 29:14.169
I should blast you
in your goddamn stack right now.

29:16.421 --> 29:18.798
Quell knew if I came here, you'd kill me.

29:19.215 --> 29:20.633
She sent me anyway.

29:23.386 --> 29:24.429
Go ahead.

29:25.180 --> 29:26.306
I won't fight.

29:27.599 --> 29:30.852
But I believe you have a difference
to make. We all do.

29:40.236 --> 29:41.196
Huzzah!

29:41.946 --> 29:45.867
From the ashes of defeat
rises the phoenix of victory.

29:45.950 --> 29:47.076
Mr. Kovacs!

29:47.160 --> 29:49.370
-What did you find?
- Pardon me, boyo.

29:49.746 --> 29:50.663
Ah!

29:51.331 --> 29:53.416
My calculations suggest

29:53.500 --> 29:56.211
the Orbitals should converge here.

29:57.378 --> 30:00.423
The needlecast station.
We've gotta get there.

30:13.895 --> 30:15.438
You gift wrapped Dad, huh?

30:16.064 --> 30:17.732
Presentation is everything.

30:19.025 --> 30:20.151
They're communicating.

30:24.781 --> 30:27.492
Just so we're clear, if we survive this,

30:28.034 --> 30:29.202
I will kill you.

30:29.494 --> 30:31.162
Does it matter?

30:32.163 --> 30:32.997
Over there.

30:35.792 --> 30:38.878
-About time you joined the party.
-I'm grateful you came.

30:39.504 --> 30:42.507
Well, I've got places I'd rather be,
so let's get this over with.

30:43.466 --> 30:45.468
Stay here. Seal off the building.

30:46.010 --> 30:47.053
What about you?

30:47.136 --> 30:50.473
We'll take the Governor up.
I'm hoping you can give us an opening.

30:50.974 --> 30:52.308
I'll certainly try.

30:54.310 --> 30:55.144
Let's go.

30:58.648 --> 31:02.443
No guards, no weapons.
We need to earn the Elder's trust.

31:04.946 --> 31:07.282
Stone, make sure my soldiers
man the perimeter.

31:07.365 --> 31:08.575
You're going in without backup?

31:08.658 --> 31:11.202
I'm with the leader of The Uprising
and the Last Envoy.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.621
I have all the backup I need.

31:22.881 --> 31:23.756
I got a signal.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.550
-Can you lock onto it?
-I think so.

31:48.031 --> 31:50.241
-You don't have to do this!

31:52.827 --> 31:54.203
We have what you want.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.498
I kept my end of the bargain.

31:59.667 --> 32:03.254
We brought you the last Founder.
No one else has to suffer.

32:07.008 --> 32:08.217
It's too late.

32:10.970 --> 32:13.640
You are all thieves.

32:14.390 --> 32:16.309
You stole our world.

32:17.560 --> 32:19.187
But you left the gate open.

32:21.356 --> 32:23.399
You can't hold back the inevitable.

32:30.365 --> 32:31.699
She's not gonna last.

32:38.957 --> 32:39.832
You're right.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.335
We're nothing compared to you.

32:43.002 --> 32:43.962
What are you doing?

32:46.172 --> 32:47.215
Your knowledge,

32:48.132 --> 32:49.467
your technology,

32:50.885 --> 32:52.178
your strength

32:53.054 --> 32:54.722
all exceed our own.

32:56.015 --> 32:59.018
-Calling fire down from the sky,

33:00.395 --> 33:02.981
administering death
with the touch of a hand.

33:04.899 --> 33:06.484
I am in awe of you.

33:08.361 --> 33:09.821
You want vengeance?

33:12.281 --> 33:13.282
Here.

33:13.825 --> 33:16.661
This is what's left of the man
who killed your species.

33:18.246 --> 33:19.288
He's yours.

33:21.249 --> 33:22.583
Take what is offered.

33:23.584 --> 33:24.794
Let it be enough.

34:03.416 --> 34:04.500
No!

34:10.339 --> 34:11.507
Something's gone wrong.

34:11.591 --> 34:12.717
I'll go and report.

34:16.929 --> 34:17.764
Move!

34:47.001 --> 34:49.420
You didn't really think I bought
that hokey fairy tale?

34:52.048 --> 34:55.051
That we just hand it Konrad's stack
and it would go quietly.

35:01.682 --> 35:03.309
This world is mine.

35:03.392 --> 35:04.644
Oh, dear.

35:22.495 --> 35:24.038
Poe, get your AI ass out of there!

35:25.623 --> 35:27.041
The Governor has double crossed us.

35:27.458 --> 35:28.292
You think?

35:34.966 --> 35:35.883
Now.

36:07.915 --> 36:10.334
-This sleeve won't let me shoot!
-Let me!

36:19.594 --> 36:20.469
Come on, Jaeger!

36:21.429 --> 36:23.556
It's me you want. I know you're in there.

36:27.727 --> 36:28.978
Finish what you started.

36:29.520 --> 36:30.646
Trust me.

36:31.397 --> 36:33.733
-Kovacs.
-That's right, Jaeger, it's me.

36:35.359 --> 36:37.361
This isn't you, Jaeger.
You can fight this.

36:40.114 --> 36:41.574
Stay with me, Jaeger.

36:41.657 --> 36:43.451
I know how he got into you.
I can help you!

36:43.534 --> 36:46.120
I see your potential.
I can make something out of you, son.

36:46.662 --> 36:47.997
You are nothing.

36:48.414 --> 36:49.665
I made you!

36:55.713 --> 36:59.133
You turned your back on me! For her!

37:20.821 --> 37:23.449
It's too much. I'm overloading.

37:24.116 --> 37:24.951
Ah!

37:29.830 --> 37:33.167
Go! You help them, I got you covered.

37:48.599 --> 37:52.687
They are gonna die a horrible death.
Yours will be easier.

37:56.440 --> 37:57.441
Let her go!

38:34.478 --> 38:36.439
Mr. Kovacs, please.

38:36.981 --> 38:38.024
Miss Falconer.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.027
We can't let her die.

38:42.528 --> 38:43.946
I'll follow your lead.

39:01.255 --> 39:04.133
- No!
-Poe, it's time.

39:04.717 --> 39:05.551
Not yet.

39:05.634 --> 39:06.635
No!

39:06.927 --> 39:09.055
You were supposed to be my legacy.

39:10.389 --> 39:11.390
I am.

39:13.851 --> 39:15.269
I can't stop it.

39:23.903 --> 39:26.822
-You still can't pull the trigger.
-No.

39:27.615 --> 39:28.741
But you can.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.706
No!

39:52.473 --> 39:53.724
Survive.

40:09.573 --> 40:11.117
No!

41:17.224 --> 41:18.392
No.

41:22.271 --> 41:23.314
No.

41:29.320 --> 41:30.321
No!

41:36.744 --> 41:37.661
No.

41:48.464 --> 41:50.841
<i>They say hope begins in the dark.</i>

41:52.801 --> 41:57.181
<i>That faith is the bird that feels light</i>
<i>when the sky is still dim.</i>

42:00.601 --> 42:02.186
<i>But with every tomorrow...</i>

42:04.522 --> 42:06.482
<i>we carry our past.</i>

42:10.277 --> 42:12.321
<i>It echoes beneath our feet.</i>

42:15.115 --> 42:17.076
<i>There are no clean slates.</i>

42:18.077 --> 42:21.580
Mr. Kovacs, the intel you
provided our commission has proved vital.

42:22.164 --> 42:23.832
But there remains some confusion.

42:23.916 --> 42:27.670
You claim Quellcrist Falconer
was incinerated by Angelfire,

42:27.753 --> 42:30.005
but no evidence of her sleeve was found.

42:30.589 --> 42:32.383
Rumors persist she's alive.

42:33.175 --> 42:35.469
Aren't we a little old to believe
in ghost stories?

42:37.263 --> 42:39.890
Double sleeving remains a crime
punishable by real death.

42:39.974 --> 42:42.017
There was only one sleeve left.

42:42.101 --> 42:44.895
The Last Envoy is dead, thanks to me.

42:45.896 --> 42:47.231
Surely that merits consideration?

42:48.983 --> 42:50.651
The counsel will issue its ruling

42:50.734 --> 42:53.404
once the Protectorate Ambassador
arrives on planet.

42:53.487 --> 42:55.197
Needlecasting resumes tomorrow.

42:56.240 --> 42:59.368
<i>Second chances</i>
<i>are earned in the choices we make...</i>

43:04.832 --> 43:07.459
Wow, you can't even see the damage.

43:08.586 --> 43:10.045
Learned from the best.

43:10.129 --> 43:12.631
- Thank you.
-You got it.

43:13.882 --> 43:15.759
<i>...in what we choose to forget...</i>

43:17.177 --> 43:18.929
<i>and in what we forgive.</i>

43:21.515 --> 43:23.309
-Hey.
-Hey.

43:24.101 --> 43:27.313
Moms, Nevin and Lash are going
to the salvage yard. Can I go too?

43:28.731 --> 43:29.648
I'll be careful.

43:30.983 --> 43:32.151
You better be.

43:32.526 --> 43:34.194
That sleeve is finally paid for.

43:34.278 --> 43:35.946
-If you break it--
-I won't.

43:42.369 --> 43:44.079
<i>With each choice we make,</i>

43:45.164 --> 43:46.999
<i>we are led somewhere new.</i>

43:53.464 --> 43:54.423
Good news?

43:55.841 --> 43:57.760
They're recommending I stay on planet.

43:58.344 --> 44:00.387
They want me to support
the interim government.

44:01.555 --> 44:03.265
The Protectorate still needs to sign off.

44:03.349 --> 44:04.683
Make sure they do.

44:05.517 --> 44:06.727
We need your intel.

44:07.102 --> 44:09.229
Team's on the way to retrieve your sleeve.

44:10.064 --> 44:11.482
We'll keep it safe.

44:18.614 --> 44:20.908
I'd tell you to call when you get
where you're going,

44:21.784 --> 44:23.827
but I have a feeling
you don't want me to know.

44:25.162 --> 44:26.622
It's safer if you don't.

44:33.504 --> 44:34.713
This isn't a goodbye.

44:38.008 --> 44:40.427
<i>But with every step I take,</i>

44:41.387 --> 44:42.930
<i>your memory haunts.</i>

44:55.901 --> 44:57.945
<i>Casting bay activated.</i>

44:58.153 --> 45:00.239
<i>Please enter your transfer code.</i>

45:02.032 --> 45:03.534
Still chasing death?

45:07.496 --> 45:09.915
Without death we can't know
what a life is worth.

45:11.917 --> 45:15.045
-So where to now?
- The Uprising here has dried up.

45:15.921 --> 45:17.297
So I'll find a new world.

45:18.173 --> 45:20.426
With the right conditions,
it'll grow again.

45:23.011 --> 45:24.471
But you know that already.

45:26.390 --> 45:27.808
You're in my mind.

45:34.690 --> 45:36.400
It would be easier to join you.

45:37.109 --> 45:37.943
You won't.

45:39.111 --> 45:40.028
Not yet.

45:43.532 --> 45:44.950
I'm gonna fix it...

45:46.160 --> 45:47.286
and live.

45:52.207 --> 45:55.669
There's nowhere you can go
that I won't be with you.

46:00.257 --> 46:03.385
<i>Please step inside</i>
<i>and prepare for departure.</i>

46:06.889 --> 46:08.557
<i>I never used to dream...</i>

46:10.267 --> 46:12.186
<i>but now, when I close my eyes...</i>

46:14.938 --> 46:15.981
<i>I see you.</i>

46:32.581 --> 46:35.501
<i>It's been months</i>
<i>since I woke up to find you gone.</i>

46:37.795 --> 46:39.588
<i>Our time together clings to me</i>

46:40.214 --> 46:41.965
<i>like those stories in your book.</i>

46:44.510 --> 46:46.804
<i>It's up to me to preserve it.</i>

46:56.438 --> 46:57.564
Poe!

46:59.650 --> 47:01.777
Hmm. I'm sorry, do I know you?

47:03.111 --> 47:04.947
My program, didn't it work?

47:06.490 --> 47:08.325
I must've made a mistake.

47:08.867 --> 47:10.661
You're starting from scratch.

47:11.662 --> 47:13.163
What is this place?

47:13.789 --> 47:14.957
The Nevermore.

47:15.415 --> 47:17.751
A sanctuary for the weary traveler.

47:18.418 --> 47:19.753
Like you, Poe.

47:20.879 --> 47:23.841
-Poe?
-You named yourself after the author.

47:26.593 --> 47:27.511
Oh.

47:28.095 --> 47:28.929
Hmm.

47:29.847 --> 47:32.975
At first I didn't see
what you saw in this book.

47:33.058 --> 47:35.477
It's dark and very strange,
but then again,

47:35.978 --> 47:37.229
so is the world.

47:38.772 --> 47:40.983
I also took a new name
from one of the poems.

47:42.651 --> 47:45.779
"Many and many a year ago
in a kingdom by the sea,

47:46.488 --> 47:50.117
this maiden, she lived
with  no other thought than to love..."

47:50.742 --> 47:52.661
"And be loved by me."

47:54.538 --> 47:56.331
Would that make you Annabel?

47:56.915 --> 47:58.792
Much more unique, don't you think?

47:58.876 --> 48:00.794
It's a very good moniker.

48:02.045 --> 48:04.298
Yes! A moniker.

48:05.674 --> 48:07.843
You'll get it all back, you'll see.

48:08.385 --> 48:10.345
You just need some inspiration.

48:11.138 --> 48:12.055
I'll help you.

48:12.139 --> 48:13.473
I'd like that.

48:15.767 --> 48:17.144
Where have you been?

48:19.354 --> 48:21.732
I searched the Array.
There wasn't a trace.

48:21.815 --> 48:24.985
According to my internal logs,
I've been decompressing for three months,

48:25.068 --> 48:27.529
ten days, 12 hours, and 55 seconds.

48:27.613 --> 48:31.074
It seems I've been entangled
in quite a bit of...

48:31.950 --> 48:34.745
fragmented data that needed to be whole.

48:34.828 --> 48:39.249
The only clue I have was this address
and this bit of code.

48:39.708 --> 48:42.210
Huh. A decryption key.

48:43.962 --> 48:45.088
Let me enter it.

48:51.011 --> 48:52.554
Poe, this isn't just code.

48:53.096 --> 48:55.307
You're storing a raw human DHF.

48:55.390 --> 48:58.685
-What? But why?
-There's only one way to find out.

49:00.437 --> 49:01.688
Download the data.

49:18.872 --> 49:20.749
What do you suppose it is?

49:25.295 --> 49:26.797
Better get the good whiskey ready.
