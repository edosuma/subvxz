00:24.357 --> 00:26.825
Keats, where you going?

00:26.860 --> 00:28.327
Go back to sleep.

00:28.361 --> 00:29.692
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:29.729 --> 00:30.923
I know you can't be doing

00:30.964 --> 00:32.454
any last-minute
Christmas shopping.

00:32.499 --> 00:34.091
You buy all your
gifts in September.

00:34.134 --> 00:35.692
I really should go,
that's all.

00:35.735 --> 00:38.431
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

00:38.471 --> 00:41.702
You know, it's no secret
that we sleep together.

00:41.741 --> 00:43.299
You don't have to keep
sneaking out of here

00:43.343 --> 00:45.937
at the crack of dawn.

00:45.979 --> 00:48.106
I... I'm sorry.

00:48.148 --> 00:49.342
I know.

00:49.382 --> 00:51.748
I-I...

00:51.785 --> 00:53.412
I don't know what it is.

00:53.453 --> 00:56.445
It just... it just
makes me feel uncomfortable.

00:56.489 --> 00:58.855
I feel like I did
when my mom caught me

00:58.892 --> 01:01.224
kissing my boyfriend
in the eighth grade.

01:02.862 --> 01:04.955
You're not in the
eighth grade anymore.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.965
I know. I know.

01:07.033 --> 01:08.364
So why don't you
come back in here?

01:08.401 --> 01:10.392
There's a little Walsh
holiday tradition

01:10.437 --> 01:11.904
I think you should know about.

01:11.938 --> 01:13.303
It's kind of fun.

01:13.339 --> 01:14.772
It's a little game.

01:37.363 --> 01:39.160
Brandon?

01:41.734 --> 01:44.464
Brandon, honey, are you up?

01:47.307 --> 01:49.571
Did you hear that?

01:49.609 --> 01:51.167
Of course I did.

01:51.211 --> 01:52.769
Someone just knocked
on your door.

01:52.812 --> 01:54.279
Brandon?

01:54.314 --> 01:56.145
Who is that?

01:56.182 --> 01:58.377
You're not going to believe it,
because I don't.

01:58.418 --> 02:00.409
Uh, hang on a second, Mom!

02:00.453 --> 02:02.182
Your mother? Oh, my God!

02:02.222 --> 02:03.814
This is worse
than eighth grade.

02:03.857 --> 02:04.949
Brandon, honey, are you up?

02:05.058 --> 02:06.047
Hang on!

02:07.527 --> 02:08.652
Surprise!

02:08.695 --> 02:10.424
Mom, what are you doing here?

02:10.463 --> 02:12.124
I'm home for the holidays.

02:12.165 --> 02:14.463
Oh, Brandon,

02:14.501 --> 02:15.900
I'm so sorry.

02:15.935 --> 02:17.527
You have company.

02:17.570 --> 02:20.164
Yeah. Mom, this is,
uh, Susan Keats.

02:20.206 --> 02:21.503
Susan, this is my...

02:21.541 --> 02:23.805
- my mom.
- How do you do, Susan?

02:23.843 --> 02:26.471
Well, at the moment,
I'm-I'm rather mortified.

02:26.513 --> 02:29.141
But nice to meet you.

02:29.182 --> 02:31.173
I'm so sorry.

02:31.217 --> 02:32.548
I'll be in the kitchen.

02:32.585 --> 02:33.483
Where's Dad?

02:33.520 --> 02:35.988
To tell you the truth, Brandon,

02:36.055 --> 02:39.320
right now, I don't know.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.587
You know, I love what
you've done with the house.

04:25.632 --> 04:27.964
You've really held
down the fort for us.

04:28.067 --> 04:30.968
Mom, what's going on?

04:31.004 --> 04:33.495
I don't exactly know.

04:33.539 --> 04:35.336
I just had to get out of there.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.172
Why?

04:37.210 --> 04:39.075
Your father and I haven't
been getting on very well.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.374
What do you mean?

04:40.413 --> 04:41.971
Brandon,
Dad loves it in Hong Kong.

04:42.081 --> 04:44.447
This job has given him
a new lease on life.

04:44.484 --> 04:46.850
I haven't seen him this happy
since he was 20 years old.

04:46.886 --> 04:48.513
So what's the problem?

04:48.554 --> 04:50.112
I'm what's the problem.

04:50.156 --> 04:51.919
He's doing great, Brandon,

04:51.958 --> 04:53.425
but I have no life.

04:53.459 --> 04:57.555
You can only tour Tiger
Balm Gardens so many times.

04:57.597 --> 05:00.327
So, your father booked us on
a holiday cruise with his boss.

05:00.366 --> 05:03.130
I told him I wanted
to have Christmas with you.

05:03.169 --> 05:05.228
We fought about it.

05:05.271 --> 05:07.933
Said he was going
with or without me.

05:08.041 --> 05:09.303
So here I am.

05:09.342 --> 05:11.833
I don't know what to say.

05:11.878 --> 05:14.108
I don't know either.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.775
Except I'm sorry.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.340
Seem to be saying that a lot.

05:18.384 --> 05:20.318
But you're going back, right?

05:20.353 --> 05:23.618
I don't really know.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.783
Right now,
I don't know anything.

05:33.633 --> 05:35.157
Hey, there he is.

05:35.201 --> 05:36.293
There's my boy.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.201
A little late as usual,
but he's here.

05:38.237 --> 05:39.397
Steve-o, thanks
for coming down.

05:39.439 --> 05:41.236
- No problem. What's up?
- Listen, I have some

05:41.274 --> 05:43.105
special last-minute
gifts that have to go out,

05:43.142 --> 05:45.303
and, uh, your dad said
you wouldn't mind.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.780
- Not at all.
- Okay, good.

05:48.815 --> 05:50.305
The boxes are in
the trunk of my car.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.544
Now, every one of them
has got a tag

05:51.584 --> 05:52.983
with a name and address on it.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.782
I told the parking attendant
you'd be picking them up.

05:54.821 --> 05:55.981
- Can you handle that?
- Sure.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.853
Good. Knew I could
count on you, Stevie.

05:57.890 --> 06:00.154
I'm gonna hit
a few practice balls.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.421
See you on the tee in ten?

06:01.461 --> 06:03.452
- You got it.
- Okay.

06:05.465 --> 06:07.330
You could have at
least asked me first.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.334
I had plans today.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.733
Will you stop whining?

06:09.769 --> 06:11.703
What do you think it takes
to get ahead in this business?

06:11.738 --> 06:12.864
You got to go that extra mile.

06:12.905 --> 06:14.304
Dad, it's Christmas Eve.

06:14.340 --> 06:17.605
That is the extra mile.

06:17.643 --> 06:18.940
You're like Scrooge,
you know that?

06:18.978 --> 06:19.945
Will you stop it?

06:19.979 --> 06:21.105
Will you do yourself a favor

06:21.147 --> 06:23.206
and do Scott a favor,
deliver the gifts?

06:23.249 --> 06:24.944
And, uh, don't screw up
as usual, will you?

06:24.984 --> 06:26.474
I got a game to win.

06:26.519 --> 06:28.510
Excuse me.
See you later.

06:35.528 --> 06:37.223
What do you think?

06:37.263 --> 06:38.821
- It's wonderful.
- Thanks.

06:38.865 --> 06:40.196
I hope David likes it.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.292
But I still think we should
have done it in the nude.

06:42.335 --> 06:44.098
Yeah, well, then we'd have
to give Kelly a lobotomy.

06:44.137 --> 06:45.104
Yeah.

06:46.139 --> 06:47.333
Hang on a second.

06:47.373 --> 06:49.841
I'll get you some bubble pack
to wrap that in.

06:51.844 --> 06:52.811
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

06:52.845 --> 06:54.437
How you doing?
Special delivery.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.778
Thanks, Paul.

06:56.816 --> 06:59.182
Here you go, Pauly.

06:59.218 --> 07:00.845
- Merry Christmas.
- Yeah.

07:00.887 --> 07:02.878
Looks like it's
gonna be a white one.

07:05.491 --> 07:06.890
Where were we?

07:06.926 --> 07:09.827
Planning on doing
some indoor skiing?

07:09.862 --> 07:12.228
Uh, it's for a friend.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.165
- Yeah, sure.
- Look, uh,

07:14.200 --> 07:15.861
I bought a gram of coke
for the holidays.

07:15.902 --> 07:17.426
You guys all drink, and I don't.

07:17.470 --> 07:19.370
I just wanted a little
holiday cheer of my own.

07:19.405 --> 07:20.531
It's no big deal.

07:20.573 --> 07:21.835
No. If you want to put

07:21.874 --> 07:23.273
that poison up your nose,
it's your business.

07:23.309 --> 07:25.641
Actually, it'd be cool
if it stayed that way, too.

07:25.678 --> 07:26.940
Kelly's a little sensitive
about this.

07:26.979 --> 07:29.140
Well, Kelly's sensitive
about everything.

07:29.182 --> 07:30.615
You can trust me.

07:30.650 --> 07:31.947
Thanks, Val.

07:31.984 --> 07:33.474
So I guess you don't want
to do a line with me.

07:33.519 --> 07:35.749
No.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.050
No, you're on your own.

07:37.089 --> 07:40.320
Well, what's Christmas
without a little snow?

07:49.368 --> 07:50.699
Come on.

07:50.736 --> 07:52.431
Admit it, Sanders,
this is total fun.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.905
Oh, yeah, I'm having
a great time.

07:53.940 --> 07:56.500
But if my father knew, he
wouldn't have volunteered me.

07:56.542 --> 07:58.271
- Shut up and have some more
cookies. - No, no, no.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.278
1204.

08:00.379 --> 08:01.471
Ho, ho, ho!

08:03.516 --> 08:04.574
Yes?

08:04.617 --> 08:06.881
Delivery from Scott Coveny.

08:06.919 --> 08:08.250
Oh, I love presents.

08:08.287 --> 08:09.549
What did Scotty get me now?

08:13.526 --> 08:15.391
This is adorable.

08:15.428 --> 08:16.690
A toy oven?

08:16.729 --> 08:18.663
Well, you tell Scotty
that I'm thrilled

08:18.698 --> 08:20.598
and that I'll cook for him
anytime.

08:20.633 --> 08:22.498
I'll pass that along.

08:26.205 --> 08:29.470
Oh, shut your face.

08:34.380 --> 08:36.177
Take it from one who knows,

08:36.215 --> 08:38.808
there's no such thing
as an amicable divorce.

08:38.851 --> 08:39.840
Whoa, wait a second.

08:39.885 --> 08:41.409
Who said anything
about a divorce?

08:41.453 --> 08:42.886
Hey, my parents said
the same thing.

08:42.922 --> 08:43.946
Next thing I knew,

08:44.056 --> 08:45.648
they were divvying up
the garden tools.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.090
Did you get ahold of Jim?

08:47.126 --> 08:48.787
No. It's been impossible.

08:48.828 --> 08:50.523
He's on a cruise ship
in the South China Sea.

08:50.563 --> 08:51.894
You know, I always
thought your parents

08:51.931 --> 08:53.262
were the perfect couple.

08:53.299 --> 08:55.096
They're just human, David.

08:55.134 --> 08:57.602
Well, if anyone can work
it out, I know they can.

08:57.637 --> 08:59.605
If they don't, well, you'll
get through that, too.

08:59.639 --> 09:01.334
Yeah. Thanks, man.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.535
Listen, I got to get going.
Uh, tell your mom

09:03.576 --> 09:05.168
- I'll see her later, okay?
- Yeah.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.145
I'm sure she's so jet-lagged,
she'll sleep all day anyway.

09:07.179 --> 09:08.771
Okay, bye.

09:08.814 --> 09:09.803
Take it easy, man.

09:09.849 --> 09:10.907
See you guys.

09:13.619 --> 09:15.917
You don't look so hot.

09:15.988 --> 09:18.479
I don't feel so hot.

09:18.524 --> 09:21.254
Well, don't sell
your folks short.

09:21.294 --> 09:24.320
Sometimes, people just
need time alone.

09:24.363 --> 09:25.330
You think so?

09:25.364 --> 09:26.922
This is Jim and Cindy Walsh.

09:26.966 --> 09:28.797
Give them a little
more credit, pal.

09:28.834 --> 09:31.632
I just get the feeling
she's not telling me everything.

09:31.671 --> 09:33.536
Maybe there isn't more to tell.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.838
Listen, if you want,
I'll talk to her.

09:36.876 --> 09:39.071
Yeah.

09:39.111 --> 09:40.578
You know, that might be good.

09:40.613 --> 09:42.376
We're doing the tree trimming
thing over at our house tonight.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.541
Why don't you come over?

09:43.583 --> 09:45.483
I'll be there.

09:57.229 --> 09:58.594
- Donna.
- Huh?

09:58.631 --> 09:59.723
What are you doing?

09:59.765 --> 10:02.393
I'm trying to open
Joe's present.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.561
I just can't stand it.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.127
I just got to see
what's inside of there.

10:05.171 --> 10:07.230
- You are a bad girl.
- I know.

10:07.273 --> 10:10.367
And that's why I happen to have
the exact same color ribbon.

10:10.409 --> 10:12.502
See, all I have to do
is cut this ribbon,

10:12.545 --> 10:14.445
open the box, peek inside,

10:14.480 --> 10:17.813
put the box on, retie it with
my ribbon, and he'll never know.

10:17.850 --> 10:20.080
Oh, so you have it all
figured out, do you?

10:20.119 --> 10:22.679
Oh, yeah, that's me.

10:22.722 --> 10:24.280
All under control.

10:27.026 --> 10:29.358
My God.

10:30.396 --> 10:31.590
I think Joe knows you

10:31.631 --> 10:33.462
a little bit better
than you thought he did.

10:33.499 --> 10:35.899
There's a card.

10:35.935 --> 10:37.493
"Gotcha."

10:41.273 --> 10:42.672
That scared me.

10:42.708 --> 10:43.697
Oh.

10:44.977 --> 10:48.344
Why do you let your father
get you down, anyway?

10:48.381 --> 10:50.281
Because he lives to put me down.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.305
I can't take it anymore.

10:51.350 --> 10:52.749
So ignore him.

10:52.785 --> 10:53.945
You're a big boy.

10:53.986 --> 10:55.248
You're right.

10:55.287 --> 10:57.278
But you know, no matter
how bad it gets with him,

10:57.323 --> 11:00.486
I have to remind myself that
he's not my real father anyway.

11:00.526 --> 11:01.891
Who the hell cares?

11:01.927 --> 11:03.053
What are you talking about?

11:03.095 --> 11:04.426
I'm adopted.

11:05.464 --> 11:07.227
You are not.

11:07.266 --> 11:08.733
- I am.
- I don't believe you.

11:08.768 --> 11:09.928
It's true.

11:11.971 --> 11:13.836
I'm sorry.

11:13.873 --> 11:16.205
Can we just drop this, please?

11:16.242 --> 11:17.504
Yeah.

11:23.349 --> 11:24.941
- Hello. Can I help you?
- Yes.

11:24.984 --> 11:26.679
Merry Christmas
from Scott Coveny.

11:26.719 --> 11:28.243
I've got a present here
for Darla Mitchell.

11:28.287 --> 11:30.221
Oh.

11:30.256 --> 11:31.348
That's me!

11:31.390 --> 11:32.914
From Uncle Scotty!

11:32.958 --> 11:35.256
Yeah. I'm sure he knows whether
you've been naughty or nice.

11:35.294 --> 11:37.091
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

11:37.129 --> 11:38.118
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

11:38.164 --> 11:39.256
Merry Christmas.

11:39.298 --> 11:43.234
Let's see that.

11:43.269 --> 11:45.237
So, what about you?

11:45.271 --> 11:48.001
Have you been, uh,
naughty or nice?

11:48.040 --> 11:50.440
Well, I've had some impure
thoughts; does that count?

12:02.154 --> 12:03.451
I guess this isn't exactly

12:03.489 --> 12:05.081
the Christmas
you had in mind, is it?

12:05.124 --> 12:06.489
Why would you say that, Mom?

12:06.525 --> 12:08.720
Just because my family's
about to crash and burn?

12:13.766 --> 12:16.462
I always love
this part the most.

12:16.502 --> 12:18.436
It's like meeting
old friends again.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.632
Oh, look.

12:20.673 --> 12:22.868
Clothespin reindeer.

12:24.477 --> 12:27.207
You and Brenda were six
when you made that.

12:27.246 --> 12:29.009
We were seven.

12:31.050 --> 12:33.780
Please don't be angry with me.

12:35.221 --> 12:37.348
I don't think I can take that.

12:37.389 --> 12:38.856
I'm not angry, Mom.

12:38.891 --> 12:41.359
It's just...

12:41.393 --> 12:43.190
The thought of you
and Dad splitting up

12:43.229 --> 12:44.890
doesn't exactly go down
very easily.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.420
Especially at this time of year.

12:46.465 --> 12:47.955
Honey,

12:48.000 --> 12:50.969
the people in your family
will always be your family,

12:51.003 --> 12:54.234
no matter what happens
with your dad and me.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.763
How could he do this to you?

12:55.808 --> 12:57.207
Don't blame your father.

12:57.243 --> 12:58.710
This is not his fault.

12:58.744 --> 12:59.938
Then who should I blame?

12:59.979 --> 13:02.641
Me, if you need
to blame somebody.

13:03.682 --> 13:05.912
I just don't understand.

13:05.951 --> 13:07.942
Honey, listen.

13:08.988 --> 13:11.786
Your father has a whole new life

13:11.824 --> 13:14.054
and I haven't
been able to keep up.

13:14.093 --> 13:18.052
We just don't seem to have
anything in common anymore.

13:18.097 --> 13:21.294
And to be perfectly honest,

13:21.333 --> 13:23.324
there may not be
anything we can do.

13:23.369 --> 13:24.700
That's impossible.

13:24.737 --> 13:27.763
A few months ago I would have
thought the same thing.

13:29.875 --> 13:31.672
Why isn't he calling?

13:31.710 --> 13:33.302
I told him not to.

13:33.345 --> 13:34.334
Great.

13:34.380 --> 13:36.610
That makes
for good communication.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.640
Brandon,

13:38.684 --> 13:40.811
right now I just want

13:40.853 --> 13:44.550
to try to have a nice
Christmas with my son,

13:44.590 --> 13:46.581
- okay?
- Okay.

13:47.593 --> 13:49.584
I'll do my best.

13:49.628 --> 13:51.493
I know you will.

13:51.530 --> 13:53.930
I know this is hard for you.

13:53.966 --> 13:55.957
But it's Christmas.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.493
Let's make the most of it.

14:01.540 --> 14:03.531
Okay.

14:25.898 --> 14:27.866
Come on,
what's my real present?

14:27.900 --> 14:29.527
Sorry, Charlie.

14:29.568 --> 14:31.502
You gave up the right to a
real present when you opened

14:31.537 --> 14:33.505
- the last one.
- That's not fair.

14:33.539 --> 14:34.733
A simple instruction.

14:34.773 --> 14:36.400
Do not open till Christmas,

14:36.442 --> 14:37.670
and you couldn't follow that.

14:37.710 --> 14:38.802
You've been a bad girl,

14:38.844 --> 14:40.243
and I thought
it was my obligation

14:40.279 --> 14:41.906
to call Santa and let him know.

14:41.947 --> 14:42.971
Joe.

14:43.082 --> 14:45.141
Sorry. Just the way it is.

14:45.184 --> 14:47.175
It's a cruel world, Donna.

14:47.219 --> 14:48.447
I hate you.

14:48.487 --> 14:50.614
I love you, too.

14:50.656 --> 14:53.648
Hmm.

14:53.692 --> 14:56.160
Is it true that for your
first Christmas in L.A.

14:56.195 --> 14:57.992
you spray-painted a dead tree?

14:58.030 --> 14:59.554
It's an ugly rumor.

14:59.598 --> 15:00.997
Mm-hmm.

15:01.033 --> 15:03.661
Well, my first Christmas
in L.A. was sophomore year

15:03.702 --> 15:06.500
and, um, well, Jonathan...

15:06.538 --> 15:07.937
well, he wanted to stay in town,

15:07.973 --> 15:09.804
you know, for the holidays,
and so we ended up

15:09.842 --> 15:12.436
decorating a palm tree
outside his apartment building.

15:12.478 --> 15:14.275
I, of course was inspired

15:14.313 --> 15:15.940
and wrote my first column,

15:15.981 --> 15:17.949
"Hanging Tinsel in Tinseltown."

15:17.983 --> 15:19.610
Clever.

15:19.652 --> 15:22.280
Well, actually it was really
rather depressing.

15:22.321 --> 15:24.448
I spent the entire
Christmas Eve watching him

15:24.490 --> 15:26.117
blue pencil me to death.

15:26.158 --> 15:27.250
Really.

15:27.293 --> 15:29.284
Can't imagine
what that's like.

15:30.996 --> 15:33.294
I'm glad to see Brandon's
been lightening up.

15:33.332 --> 15:35.459
He's been taking this
pretty hard.

15:35.501 --> 15:38.129
Men always think everything
is about them.

15:38.170 --> 15:41.139
Jim kept asking me
what he'd done wrong.

15:41.173 --> 15:43.141
I couldn't get him
to understand

15:43.175 --> 15:44.665
that it wasn't about him.

15:44.710 --> 15:46.678
Well, I'm really glad
you're here, anyways,

15:46.712 --> 15:49.840
even though it's not under
the best circumstances.

15:49.882 --> 15:51.315
Me, too.

15:52.818 --> 15:54.786
- Ho, ho, ho.
- Hey.

15:54.820 --> 15:56.310
- Hey, Steve.
- Santa's here.

15:56.355 --> 15:57.344
And his little helper.

15:57.389 --> 15:58.515
And his other little helper.

15:58.557 --> 16:00.525
Yes, well, speak
for yourself, darlings.

16:00.559 --> 16:02.186
I'm Santa's big helper.

16:02.227 --> 16:04.195
Hi.

16:04.229 --> 16:06.026
Hey!

16:06.065 --> 16:08.363
Merry Christmas, guys!

16:18.811 --> 16:20.438
I know you bought me
a present.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.140
And if you didn't,
you are in big trouble

16:22.181 --> 16:23.808
because it's my birthday
and it's Christmas,

16:23.849 --> 16:25.544
- and you know that.
- Okay.

16:25.584 --> 16:27.552
- Yes, I got you something.
- Hmm.

16:27.586 --> 16:30.555
Something very special.

16:30.589 --> 16:33.057
Something that I've been
working on for a few weeks.

16:33.092 --> 16:34.389
Oh, you made it?

16:34.426 --> 16:36.394
Mmm, not exactly.

16:36.428 --> 16:38.123
Come on, no more hints.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.131
- I'm gonna give it
to you tomorrow. - Oh, come on.

16:40.165 --> 16:42.133
Even my mother let me
open her present.

16:42.167 --> 16:43.964
That's 'cause she's in Hawaii.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.664
Come on, Donna, give it up.

16:45.704 --> 16:48.332
I've been shaved and
covered in Bengay,

16:48.374 --> 16:49.966
and I didn't crack.

16:50.042 --> 16:51.270
Your last girlfriend?

16:51.310 --> 16:53.278
No, the offensive line.

16:54.546 --> 16:56.980
What exactly did they shave?

16:57.049 --> 16:59.574
Never mind.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.012
So, I come out

17:05.057 --> 17:07.491
of the subway and it's like
4:00 a.m. Christmas morning.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.460
I mean, New York is,
like, Silent Night,

17:09.494 --> 17:11.053
Holy Night.

17:11.096 --> 17:12.757
There's not a soul
in Bryant Park,

17:12.798 --> 17:15.790
except for this absolutely
beautiful Puerto Rican girl.

17:15.834 --> 17:17.926
I mean, maybe she's 17,

17:17.970 --> 17:19.300
and she's sitting on a bench

17:19.338 --> 17:21.568
and she's like having a baby,
right there in the park,

17:21.607 --> 17:22.733
right there on the bench.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.367
So, I look over
and there's these, like,

17:24.410 --> 17:26.310
three winos standing around her,

17:26.345 --> 17:27.936
standing all around her like,

17:28.012 --> 17:29.310
like the three wise men.

17:29.348 --> 17:30.645
And then what happened?

17:30.682 --> 17:32.309
It's New York.
They mugged her.

17:32.351 --> 17:34.182
Oh, that's terrible.

17:34.219 --> 17:35.447
I'm just kidding.

17:35.487 --> 17:37.045
We took her to St. Vincent's

17:37.089 --> 17:38.784
and guess what
she named the baby?

17:38.824 --> 17:40.587
- Jesus.
- Howard.

17:40.626 --> 17:42.526
She named the baby Howard?

17:42.561 --> 17:43.755
She was a Howard Stern freak.

17:43.796 --> 17:45.286
She actually named
the baby Howard Stern...

17:45.330 --> 17:47.298
Garcia.

17:47.332 --> 17:48.629
I love New York.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.635
- I love you.
- Mmm.

17:50.669 --> 17:52.534
I need to hit the little,
uh, elves' room.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.562
Excuse me.

17:56.642 --> 17:59.611
Boy, Colin sure is
Mr. Social tonight.

17:59.645 --> 18:00.942
Well, I guess Christmas

18:00.979 --> 18:02.913
just brings out the
best in some people.

18:02.981 --> 18:05.916
Yeah, if you ask me,
he's lit like a fuse.

18:05.984 --> 18:08.976
Well, then let's make sure
nobody asks you, okay?

18:13.592 --> 18:14.923
Where do you think
all this mistletoe

18:15.027 --> 18:16.551
folklore started, huh?

18:16.595 --> 18:18.586
Oh, I don't know,

18:18.630 --> 18:21.656
some love-starved
European botanist, maybe.

18:21.700 --> 18:23.099
You know, this is
really turning out

18:23.135 --> 18:24.602
to be an excellent Christmas.

18:24.636 --> 18:26.467
You have a lot to do
with that, Clare.

18:26.505 --> 18:28.939
Well, I have a special
present for you later.

18:29.007 --> 18:30.907
Ooh, I love presents.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.069
What do you have,

18:32.111 --> 18:33.703
some mistletoe hanging
from your headboard?

18:33.745 --> 18:37.146
No, actually, it's, uh,
on my garter belt.

18:39.318 --> 18:41.445
Ah, the kids are great,

18:41.487 --> 18:43.921
but you know, sometimes...

18:43.956 --> 18:45.685
Oh, thanks.

18:45.724 --> 18:47.851
Sometimes it's just nice
to talk to someone

18:47.893 --> 18:49.952
who knows that there
was life before MTV.

18:50.062 --> 18:51.859
Oh, I know what you mean.

18:51.897 --> 18:53.296
Do you have to go so soon?

18:53.332 --> 18:54.458
Yeah, I'm late already.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.297
- Where are you off to?
- Midnight mass.

18:56.335 --> 18:57.632
I never miss it.

18:57.669 --> 18:59.364
- Do you have room for one more?
- Sure.

18:59.404 --> 19:01.201
My sleigh's parked
down the block.

19:01.240 --> 19:02.673
I'll go around
and bring it out.

19:02.708 --> 19:04.141
I'll get my coat, I'll
meet you out front.

19:04.176 --> 19:05.234
Okay.

19:07.279 --> 19:09.270
Oh.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.650
Rush! Come on in.

19:13.685 --> 19:14.845
Cindy!

19:14.887 --> 19:16.320
What a nice surprise.

19:16.355 --> 19:17.379
Hi.

19:17.422 --> 19:18.821
I didn't know
you were in town.

19:18.857 --> 19:20.825
- Oh, it's a last minute visit.
- Is Jim here?

19:20.859 --> 19:22.827
- I'll take him out
on the golf course. - Uh, no.

19:22.861 --> 19:23.919
I-I came by myself.

19:24.029 --> 19:26.020
Everything all right, kid?

19:26.064 --> 19:27.793
Actually, no.

19:27.833 --> 19:28.765
Anything I can do?

19:28.800 --> 19:30.324
Marry me?

19:30.369 --> 19:32.337
Why not?

19:32.371 --> 19:33.804
Don't take it too hard.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.306
Happens to the best of us.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.308
And to some of us,
more than once.

19:37.342 --> 19:38.934
I hope it's not happening to me.

19:39.044 --> 19:40.170
Me, too.

19:40.212 --> 19:41.941
My son around?

19:42.014 --> 19:43.914
Oh, he's in there somewhere.

19:43.949 --> 19:45.211
Listen, I'm rushing off
to church.

19:45.250 --> 19:46.911
- I hope you don't mind.
- No, of course not.

19:46.952 --> 19:48.249
Steve, your dad's here.

19:48.287 --> 19:49.652
Oh, Brandon,

19:49.688 --> 19:51.053
I'll be back
in a couple of hours.

19:51.089 --> 19:52.488
I'm going to church
with Nat, okay?

19:52.524 --> 19:54.492
- Okay, Mom, see you later.
- Bye-bye.

19:54.526 --> 19:56.892
- See you later.
- Bye.

19:58.931 --> 20:01.456
Dad, what are you doing here?

20:01.500 --> 20:03.092
Looking for you.

20:03.135 --> 20:04.796
Will you all excuse us please?

20:07.806 --> 20:08.830
Steve.

20:13.145 --> 20:15.113
I knew that sometimes
you could be stupid,

20:15.147 --> 20:17.445
but I never thought
you were self-destructive.

20:17.482 --> 20:19.507
Well, thanks for the
support as usual.

20:19.551 --> 20:20.540
Oh, good,

20:20.586 --> 20:21.780
sonny boy, good.

20:21.820 --> 20:23.685
You keep up the sarcasm
on the unemployment line.

20:23.722 --> 20:25.747
- What's that mean?
- Means you lost your job at ITM,

20:25.791 --> 20:27.349
and you embarrassed
the hell out of me.

20:27.392 --> 20:28.552
What are you talking about?

20:28.594 --> 20:29.788
You messed up
is what I'm talking about.

20:29.828 --> 20:30.988
I messed up?

20:31.029 --> 20:32.792
You messed up!
You delivered the present

20:32.831 --> 20:34.321
he was sending to his mistress
to his niece.

20:34.366 --> 20:36.834
His wife's sister's kid
got a leather bustier.

20:36.868 --> 20:38.733
His mistress got
a Holly Home Maker oven!

20:45.344 --> 20:47.107
This is funny to you?

20:47.145 --> 20:48.578
What the hell is wrong with you?

20:48.614 --> 20:50.206
The note that was included
in the bustier

20:50.249 --> 20:51.546
is gonna cost Scott a fortune.

20:51.583 --> 20:54.211
Dad, I just delivered
the packages

20:54.253 --> 20:55.880
to the addresses on the labels.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.115
I didn't write 'em.

20:57.155 --> 20:58.383
I didn't screw up.

20:58.423 --> 20:59.447
Somebody else did.

20:59.491 --> 21:02.426
Somebody else screwed up.

21:02.461 --> 21:04.452
That's your MO kiddo,

21:04.496 --> 21:05.758
somebody else screwed up.

21:05.797 --> 21:06.957
You mess up and it's always

21:07.032 --> 21:08.158
somebody else's fault.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.100
Just like the bloody fire.

21:12.137 --> 21:13.570
You know what?

21:13.605 --> 21:15.470
I don't need to take
that crap from you.

21:16.975 --> 21:19.375
I didn't do anything wrong.

21:19.411 --> 21:21.743
I've got nothing
to explain to you.

21:23.782 --> 21:26.774
Sometimes I'm ashamed
to call you my son.

21:28.186 --> 21:30.177
Then don't bother.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.655
You're not my father anyway!

21:32.691 --> 21:34.158
- Don't say that.
- Why not?

21:34.192 --> 21:35.989
You're not my father!

21:36.028 --> 21:38.588
You've got nothing
to be ashamed about.

21:38.630 --> 21:40.621
Neither do I.

21:42.668 --> 21:45.364
Merry Christmas.

21:45.404 --> 21:46.598
Steve...

21:48.640 --> 21:50.437
Steve...

21:50.475 --> 21:51.942
Colin, would you hurry up?

21:51.977 --> 21:53.274
I want to go home.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.305
Coming.

22:06.658 --> 22:07.784
See you, guys.

22:07.826 --> 22:08.952
- See you later.
- Bye, Colin.

22:09.061 --> 22:11.529
Look, you can let this
get you down

22:11.563 --> 22:13.827
or you can brush it off
and have a good time.

22:13.865 --> 22:15.799
You didn't do anything
wrong, Steve.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.131
Your father and Scott Coveny

22:17.169 --> 22:18.727
don't know what the heck
they're talking about.

22:18.770 --> 22:21.102
I don't care about Scott Coveny,
or those stupid presents.

22:21.139 --> 22:22.800
It's my father,
I pushed him too far.

22:22.841 --> 22:24.138
He'll understand.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.268
Understand?

22:25.310 --> 22:27.278
I practically disowned him.

22:27.312 --> 22:29.439
The guy raised me.

22:29.481 --> 22:31.108
I... I owe him.

22:31.149 --> 22:33.982
Okay, so, you'll see him
tomorrow

22:34.019 --> 22:35.213
and you'll apologize.

22:35.253 --> 22:36.880
Ugh.

22:36.922 --> 22:39.413
The thought of apologizing
to my father makes me sick.

22:39.458 --> 22:40.925
But you're going to, okay?

22:40.959 --> 22:42.984
Otherwise you're gonna have
a miserable Christmas.

22:43.061 --> 22:45.621
So what else is new?

22:49.801 --> 22:50.995
Well, thanks for everything,

22:51.069 --> 22:52.536
but we've got to get going.

22:52.571 --> 22:54.198
Picasso here is getting a cold.

22:54.239 --> 22:55.536
Just allergies.

22:55.574 --> 22:57.371
Well, I'm putting you to bed.

22:57.409 --> 22:59.206
Yeah? I think I can handle that.

23:00.412 --> 23:01.504
- Good night all.
- See ya.

23:01.546 --> 23:02.535
See you tomorrow.

23:02.581 --> 23:04.572
Good night.

23:06.852 --> 23:09.320
You sure you don't want to
come back to my place tonight?

23:09.354 --> 23:10.548
I better not.

23:10.589 --> 23:12.557
I don't want to leave
my mom alone.

23:12.591 --> 23:15.560
You're probably right.

23:15.594 --> 23:18.563
I really feel for her,
Brandon, and you, too.

23:18.597 --> 23:20.224
Everything will be okay.

23:20.265 --> 23:21.892
I hope.

23:21.933 --> 23:23.560
- See you in the morning?
- Yes, ma'am.

23:23.602 --> 23:25.069
Mmm.

23:25.103 --> 23:27.094
- Call me and let me know you got
home all right, okay? - I will.

23:41.219 --> 23:43.210
Hello?

23:43.255 --> 23:44.244
Happy Birthday.

23:44.289 --> 23:45.256
Merry Christmas.

23:45.290 --> 23:47.485
Mmm, you're so sweet.

23:47.526 --> 23:50.518
Now, you said that you were born
at 3:27, right?

23:50.562 --> 23:52.530
Well, at the tone

23:52.564 --> 23:56.432
the time will be 3:27 exactly.

23:56.468 --> 23:57.765
Beep.

23:57.803 --> 23:58.929
Thank you, Joe.

23:58.970 --> 24:00.631
I'll bring by your present
in the morning.

24:00.672 --> 24:01.798
Oh, wait, wait.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.569
Just give me one more hint,
okay?

24:03.608 --> 24:05.269
Okay, I'll give you two.

24:05.310 --> 24:07.437
It's mostly grayish.

24:07.479 --> 24:09.447
A tasteful sweater?

24:10.649 --> 24:12.947
And it's interactive.

24:13.051 --> 24:15.178
Virtual whale?

24:15.220 --> 24:17.518
Good night, Donna.

24:17.556 --> 24:18.682
Sleep well.

24:18.723 --> 24:19.951
Happy birthday.

24:20.058 --> 24:21.320
Merry Christmas.

24:21.359 --> 24:22.724
Bye.

24:23.762 --> 24:25.730
Okay, bird.

24:25.764 --> 24:27.732
Let's do this.

24:29.901 --> 24:31.869
All righty.

24:31.903 --> 24:34.371
Joe loves Donna.

24:34.406 --> 24:37.534
Joe loves Donna.
Joe loves Donna.

24:37.576 --> 24:39.544
Come on say it.

24:39.578 --> 24:41.205
Damn bird.

24:41.246 --> 24:42.543
Joe loves Donna.

24:42.581 --> 24:44.208
Come on, you can do this.

24:44.249 --> 24:46.240
Joe loves Donna.

24:48.253 --> 24:51.222
Joe loves Donna.

24:51.256 --> 24:53.247
Perfect.

24:56.628 --> 24:58.619
Joe loves Donna.

25:31.429 --> 25:33.192
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

25:33.231 --> 25:34.823
What did you get from Santa?

25:34.866 --> 25:38.768
The usual: an orange,
a couple of walnuts,

25:38.803 --> 25:41.636
a pair of socks...

25:43.675 --> 25:46.439
...and this awesome watch.

25:46.478 --> 25:48.105
I think Santa must
have touched down

25:48.146 --> 25:49.704
in Hong Kong for that one.

25:49.748 --> 25:52.342
Yeah.

25:53.385 --> 25:55.853
Thanks, Mom.

25:56.888 --> 25:58.116
Merry Christmas.

25:59.524 --> 26:00.513
I love you, honey.

26:00.559 --> 26:01.924
I love you, too.

26:01.993 --> 26:03.927
You know, I'm glad I went
to church last night.

26:03.995 --> 26:05.587
Did it help?

26:05.630 --> 26:06.756
It always helps.

26:06.798 --> 26:10.256
It gave me some peace
and made me realize

26:10.302 --> 26:11.929
I can make it on my own.

26:11.970 --> 26:15.872
I know you can, Mom, but...

26:15.907 --> 26:18.637
the question is: Do you want to?

26:19.678 --> 26:21.669
I don't know.

26:21.713 --> 26:24.147
Mom...

26:24.182 --> 26:27.151
you and Dad have been together
for 22 years.

26:27.185 --> 26:28.550
I don't care who's right

26:28.587 --> 26:33.149
or who's wrong or who's unhappy,

26:33.191 --> 26:35.091
don't you think you owe it
to each other

26:35.126 --> 26:36.525
to try to work this out?

26:36.561 --> 26:39.121
I mean, you can't just
throw away 22 years

26:39.164 --> 26:41.394
because he wanted to go
on a cruise and you didn't.

26:41.433 --> 26:44.561
There's a lot more to it
than that, and you know it.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.730
So, you're unhappy
in Hong Kong. So what?

26:46.771 --> 26:47.965
You won't be there forever.

26:48.006 --> 26:52.568
You don't understand, Brandon.

26:52.611 --> 26:55.671
We don't know who we are
to each other anymore.

26:55.714 --> 26:57.306
But do you love him, Mom?

26:59.351 --> 27:03.287
Because if you don't,
I'll just give up.

27:03.321 --> 27:05.585
I'll help you do whatever it is
you want to do.

27:05.624 --> 27:09.025
But if you do love him...

27:09.060 --> 27:10.755
you gotta try.

27:10.795 --> 27:14.094
I do love him...

27:15.533 --> 27:18.502
...but I'm not sure
that he still cares about me.

27:23.141 --> 27:24.665
I got it.

27:30.382 --> 27:33.283
I have a special delivery
package for a Mrs. James Walsh.

27:33.318 --> 27:35.252
I need a signature.

27:35.286 --> 27:36.378
Sure.

27:36.421 --> 27:38.389
Mom?

27:39.224 --> 27:42.352
Line four, please.

27:42.394 --> 27:43.827
Merry Christmas.

27:43.862 --> 27:45.193
Merry Christmas to you.

27:47.232 --> 27:49.166
Who do you think this is from?

28:12.724 --> 28:15.693
Oh, what a lovely angel.

28:20.365 --> 28:24.324
Brandon, I have to go call
the airline.

28:24.369 --> 28:26.599
There's a reservation
I need to make.

28:39.684 --> 28:41.481
What kind of mood is he in?

28:41.519 --> 28:45.046
Not a very good one, pal.

28:45.090 --> 28:46.523
That makes two of us.

28:51.763 --> 28:54.391
Merry Christmas, Dad.

28:55.467 --> 28:58.630
Ho, ho, ho.

28:58.670 --> 29:00.194
Merry Christmas.

29:00.238 --> 29:05.266
Uh, I was out of line yesterday.

29:05.310 --> 29:07.403
No matter what went down,

29:07.445 --> 29:09.379
I shouldn't have
treated you like that.

29:09.414 --> 29:11.541
No, I deserved it.

29:11.583 --> 29:12.914
I was out of line.

29:12.951 --> 29:14.543
I've been out of line
for a long time.

29:14.586 --> 29:18.852
Well, I'm not gonna argue
with you there, Dad.

29:18.890 --> 29:21.324
That's a change.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.260
You remember what you
said to me yesterday?

29:26.297 --> 29:28.265
You mean, when I was
telling you to back off?

29:28.299 --> 29:31.166
No. No, you're right about that.

29:31.202 --> 29:33.261
You were right about a
lot of other stuff, too.

29:34.606 --> 29:37.268
But you're wrong about
one very important thing.

29:39.144 --> 29:41.442
What's this?

29:41.479 --> 29:43.242
You may want to read
what's inside.

30:00.932 --> 30:02.923
This can't be.

30:02.967 --> 30:04.901
Yes, it can.

30:04.936 --> 30:06.130
It's the truth.

30:06.171 --> 30:08.298
No, it can't be.

30:08.339 --> 30:10.136
I went to New Mexico.

30:10.175 --> 30:12.109
Three Christmases ago.

30:12.143 --> 30:13.371
I found my grandfather.

30:13.411 --> 30:14.571
I saw my mother's grave.

30:14.612 --> 30:15.806
Her name was Karen Brown.

30:15.847 --> 30:17.712
Yes, it was.

30:17.749 --> 30:19.740
Your mother was Karen Brown.

30:24.088 --> 30:25.487
I'm your father.

30:28.159 --> 30:29.786
How can that be?

30:33.865 --> 30:38.234
I was doing a picture
in New Mexico, and, uh...

30:38.269 --> 30:39.827
I had an affair with a waitress

30:39.871 --> 30:41.566
who worked
in her father's diner.

30:41.606 --> 30:43.005
She got pregnant.

30:43.107 --> 30:44.699
Meanwhile, your mother
couldn't have children

30:44.742 --> 30:48.439
and-and we were trying to adopt.

30:48.479 --> 30:51.505
So I, uh...

30:51.549 --> 30:53.210
I bought my own baby.

30:53.251 --> 30:55.719
You could do that back then.

30:55.753 --> 30:58.085
All you had to do
was show a lot of cash.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.691
What do you expect me to say?

31:06.497 --> 31:08.294
I don't know
what I expect you to say.

31:08.333 --> 31:10.995
I just... it's the truth.

31:12.170 --> 31:13.933
I thought it was
about time you found out.

31:13.972 --> 31:15.234
Damn you.

31:16.507 --> 31:19.965
Do you know
what it's been like for me?

31:20.078 --> 31:21.602
Do you know what it's like

31:21.646 --> 31:23.307
to cry yourself to sleep
at night?

31:23.348 --> 31:24.610
I'm sorry...

31:24.649 --> 31:26.139
You're sorry?!

31:26.184 --> 31:28.243
Sorry doesn't cut it!

31:28.286 --> 31:30.379
I'm sick of people
being sorry for me.

31:30.421 --> 31:32.480
Sorry doesn't make up
for all the years I spent

31:32.523 --> 31:35.583
staring into strangers' faces
to see if they looked like me.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.288
I understand.

31:41.332 --> 31:43.323
You understand?

31:44.369 --> 31:45.700
You don't understand.

31:47.071 --> 31:49.335
You let me think I was
abandoned all this time.

31:49.374 --> 31:50.636
Steve, I tried

31:50.675 --> 31:52.006
to do the best I could for you.

31:52.076 --> 31:53.907
I gave you the best
that money could buy.

31:53.945 --> 31:55.708
I gave you the best clothes,
the best toys,

31:55.747 --> 31:57.112
the best of everything.

31:57.148 --> 32:00.515
But you didn't give me
what I needed the most, Dad.

32:00.551 --> 32:01.882
The truth.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.855
I couldn't tell you the truth.

32:04.889 --> 32:06.447
Your mother never knew.

32:08.159 --> 32:09.956
I couldn't tell her.

32:09.994 --> 32:11.655
I still can't.

32:11.696 --> 32:13.288
It would break her heart.

32:14.432 --> 32:17.367
What about my heart?

32:20.171 --> 32:24.972
Son, you make of it
whatever you want,

32:25.009 --> 32:28.376
but you've got
to know something.

32:28.413 --> 32:29.710
I love you.

32:29.747 --> 32:31.908
I always have.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.747
And despite what you think,

32:33.785 --> 32:36.253
and despite some
of the horrendous things

32:36.287 --> 32:38.653
I've said to you...

32:38.690 --> 32:41.181
I'm so proud to have you
as my son.

32:58.209 --> 33:00.200
You have a nice Christmas.

33:23.501 --> 33:25.162
Oh, Donna, this is wonderful.

33:25.203 --> 33:26.966
Yeah, thanks for inviting
us; this is great.

33:27.038 --> 33:29.506
Well, the Tournament
of Roses theme this year

33:29.540 --> 33:30.768
is "Kids, Laughter and Dreams."

33:30.808 --> 33:33.072
So we figured, bring in the snow
and let the kids loose.

33:33.111 --> 33:35.136
- And that you did.
- Yes.

33:36.214 --> 33:37.977
Look at this.
God, I love Christmas.

33:38.049 --> 33:39.209
What's gotten into you?

33:39.250 --> 33:40.581
I thought you were
seeing your father today.

33:40.618 --> 33:41.949
I did.
It went great.

33:41.986 --> 33:43.248
Are you in the will again?

33:43.287 --> 33:45.482
That's very funny,
Silver Bells, very funny.

33:45.523 --> 33:47.320
So you're not going
to tell us, huh?

33:47.358 --> 33:48.882
I've been trying to pry
it out of him all morning.

33:48.926 --> 33:50.951
Some miracles just
can't be explained.

33:50.995 --> 33:53.190
Like this one... snow in L.A.

33:53.231 --> 33:54.528
Give me that, kid.

33:54.565 --> 33:56.226
Santa lives.

33:56.267 --> 33:57.962
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

33:58.002 --> 34:00.596
He's been crazy
like this all morning.

34:00.638 --> 34:02.629
Remind me to have
his urine tested.

34:04.142 --> 34:07.839
I had no idea it was
gonna be this cold out here.

34:07.879 --> 34:10.109
- You know what you need?
- Hmm?

34:10.148 --> 34:11.376
Some hot chocolate.

34:11.416 --> 34:13.748
- Mmm, will you get me some?
- Mm-hmm.

34:15.319 --> 34:16.980
- I'll be right back.
- Okay, thank you.

34:18.022 --> 34:19.580
Hey, you weren't thinking

34:19.623 --> 34:21.056
of surprising me
with my present, were you?

34:21.092 --> 34:23.253
No. Not with this snow
and ice around.

34:23.293 --> 34:25.284
Aha!

34:25.329 --> 34:27.058
Why, is it something
that could freeze, mm-hmm?

34:27.098 --> 34:28.463
You never know.

34:28.498 --> 34:32.060
What? You got me something
that could freeze?

34:34.005 --> 34:35.632
Ow.

35:05.603 --> 35:06.865
Give it up, Walsh.

35:06.904 --> 35:08.838
There's not enough ice there
to chill a drink.

35:08.873 --> 35:10.238
You don't think a Minnesota boy

35:10.274 --> 35:12.674
could turn this into a snowman?

35:12.710 --> 35:14.234
No, but a Buffalo girl could.

35:14.278 --> 35:15.643
Incoming!

35:18.249 --> 35:21.685
Are you kidding me, Sanders?

35:25.690 --> 35:26.952
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

35:34.031 --> 35:36.966
Noticed anything strange
about your boyfriend lately?

35:37.001 --> 35:39.060
No.

35:39.103 --> 35:41.162
Kelly, he's high
as a proverbial kite.

35:41.205 --> 35:43.571
He's just having fun, Valerie.

35:43.608 --> 35:46.441
Face it... he's got
a nasal problem.

35:46.477 --> 35:48.707
And how do you know?

35:48.746 --> 35:50.304
Did you give it to him?

35:50.348 --> 35:52.782
Merry Christmas
to you, too, Kelly.

36:03.628 --> 36:04.925
Come on in, grab a seat.

36:05.029 --> 36:07.589
I got a great little tidbit
of news for you all.

36:07.632 --> 36:08.758
What is it now?

36:08.799 --> 36:10.027
You'll see.

36:10.067 --> 36:11.466
Come on in.
Come, come, come.

36:11.502 --> 36:12.935
Grab a seat.

36:12.970 --> 36:15.200
It's too good. I can't
keep it to myself.

36:15.239 --> 36:16.934
Okay, come on then, tell us.

36:16.974 --> 36:18.737
Well...

36:18.776 --> 36:20.710
it seems like

36:20.745 --> 36:23.077
Donna's not the only one
with a birthday today.

36:23.114 --> 36:24.843
What are you talking about?

36:24.882 --> 36:26.247
It's kind of like
my birthday today, too.

36:26.284 --> 36:28.252
Rush told me
who my real father was today.

36:28.286 --> 36:29.480
Who?

36:29.520 --> 36:30.544
He is.

36:30.588 --> 36:31.520
Rush?

36:31.556 --> 36:32.853
That's amazing.

36:32.890 --> 36:34.084
How about it, huh?

36:34.125 --> 36:36.320
Hey, Nat, iced tea
for my friends here all around.

36:36.360 --> 36:37.349
I'm buying.

36:37.395 --> 36:38.623
Hey, big spender.

36:38.663 --> 36:40.187
It's not every day a
guy finds his father.

36:40.231 --> 36:42.461
Steve, I'm so happy for you.

36:42.500 --> 36:43.831
No one's happier than I am, Kel.

36:43.868 --> 36:45.631
Well, it looks like the
Christmas curse has been lifted,

36:45.670 --> 36:46.796
huh?

36:46.837 --> 36:47.963
I love you.

36:48.005 --> 36:49.267
Excuse me, guys.

36:50.474 --> 36:51.532
Steve, congratulations, man.

36:51.576 --> 36:52.770
Thanks, man.

36:52.810 --> 36:54.778
Uh, what do you want?
I'll order for you.

36:54.812 --> 36:56.473
Um, I'm not hungry.

36:56.514 --> 36:57.742
Tea is fine.

36:57.782 --> 36:58.976
Smart boy.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.075
I hear Cindy Walsh has been
cooking all morning.

37:01.118 --> 37:02.244
She has been.

37:02.286 --> 37:03.878
And now for another surprise.

37:03.921 --> 37:06.014
Happy birthday, Christmas baby.

37:06.057 --> 37:07.319
Oh.

37:07.358 --> 37:08.484
Happy birthday.

37:08.526 --> 37:09.925
Happy birthday, Donna.

37:09.961 --> 37:11.326
Thank you, everyone.

37:11.362 --> 37:12.761
- Make a wish.
- Okay.

37:17.535 --> 37:20.299
So, what'd you get
for your 21 st birthday?

37:20.338 --> 37:22.169
Oh, lots of great presents
from everyone,

37:22.206 --> 37:23.901
except one important person.

37:23.941 --> 37:26.068
It's coming. It's coming.

37:26.110 --> 37:27.737
Yeah, yeah, it better.

37:27.778 --> 37:29.177
Mmm.

37:32.149 --> 37:33.810
What were you doing in there?

37:33.851 --> 37:35.318
Going to the bathroom.

37:35.353 --> 37:36.945
Really?

37:37.054 --> 37:39.113
What's your problem?

37:39.156 --> 37:40.748
I don't have a problem, Colin.

37:40.791 --> 37:41.951
You do.

37:42.026 --> 37:44.051
Oh, yeah? What's that?

37:45.296 --> 37:46.558
Wipe your face.

37:46.597 --> 37:48.588
Under your nose.

38:01.846 --> 38:04.371
Okay, let's go over this
one more time.

38:05.616 --> 38:07.243
Joe loves Donna.

38:07.285 --> 38:09.845
Joe loves Donna...
let me hear it loud and clear.

38:11.155 --> 38:13.919
Come on.
This is your big moment, huh?

38:14.025 --> 38:15.993
Joe loves Donna.

38:18.396 --> 38:22.162
Damn bird.
Damn bird.

38:26.404 --> 38:27.564
Kelly, would you, uh...

38:27.605 --> 38:29.505
Would you hold it
a second, please?

38:29.540 --> 38:30.871
- Sure.
- Would you?

38:30.908 --> 38:33.399
Do me a favor, everybody,
gather around for a minute.

38:33.444 --> 38:34.570
I want to make

38:34.612 --> 38:36.045
one-one more Christmas toast.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.206
Dad.

38:37.248 --> 38:38.681
Just one more.

38:38.716 --> 38:40.547
I guess most of you know by now

38:40.584 --> 38:43.451
it's, um... been
a very special day for me.

38:45.456 --> 38:47.890
For us.

38:49.393 --> 38:51.384
To fathers and sons.

38:55.366 --> 38:57.334
I love you, Dad.

39:00.171 --> 39:02.162
Oh.

39:04.241 --> 39:06.835
You know, Clare,
you were right about something.

39:06.877 --> 39:08.174
What's that?

39:08.212 --> 39:10.407
My luck has changed
since you've come around.

39:10.448 --> 39:11.813
Well, stick with me.

39:11.849 --> 39:14.147
The best is yet to come.

39:14.185 --> 39:17.154
I'm going to make a toast, also.

39:17.188 --> 39:19.156
To mothers and sons.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.316
And to good friends.

39:20.358 --> 39:21.484
- Hear! Hear!
- Hear! Hear!

39:21.525 --> 39:23.925
Yes.

39:24.028 --> 39:25.723
Who could that be?

39:25.763 --> 39:26.855
It's open!

39:27.898 --> 39:30.924
Oh. Sorry I'm late, guys.

39:30.968 --> 39:33.596
Donna's gift was being
a little temperamental.

39:33.637 --> 39:35.127
Come on. I can't
stand the suspense.

39:35.172 --> 39:36.639
- What is it?
- Okay, close your eyes.

39:36.674 --> 39:39.074
Oh, what is it?
What is it?

39:42.313 --> 39:43.871
Okay. Open 'em up.

39:45.149 --> 39:46.946
She's an African gray.

39:47.017 --> 39:49.815
Oh! She is such a cutie pie.

39:49.854 --> 39:51.287
Well, that's what you
should name her.

39:51.322 --> 39:52.619
Oh. Joe, she's...

39:52.656 --> 39:53.953
She's beautiful.

39:54.024 --> 39:55.958
Hi, cutie pie.

39:56.026 --> 39:57.493
- Hello.
- Oh, there's more.

39:57.528 --> 39:59.052
She's got a message for you.

39:59.096 --> 40:01.656
All right, uh, C.P., you're on.

40:01.699 --> 40:03.860
Come on, now,
don't screw this up.

40:03.901 --> 40:06.597
I've been training her
for weeks.

40:08.005 --> 40:10.565
Joe loves Donna.
Joe loves Donna.

40:14.345 --> 40:15.334
Damn bird!

40:17.581 --> 40:18.673
Damn bird!

40:18.716 --> 40:19.774
Damn bird!

40:19.817 --> 40:21.944
- That's good work.
- Damn bird.

40:21.986 --> 40:23.613
You got a great career
as a bird trainer there, Joe.

40:23.654 --> 40:25.451
What was she supposed to say?

40:25.489 --> 40:28.549
Joe loves Donna.
Joe loves Donna.

40:28.592 --> 40:29.786
Damn bird.

40:29.827 --> 40:31.317
Oh. I love you.

40:32.463 --> 40:33.555
I love you, too.

40:33.597 --> 40:35.497
Damn bird loves Donna.

40:38.035 --> 40:39.161
Mom.

40:39.203 --> 40:40.830
I wish I could stay for dinner,

40:40.871 --> 40:43.863
but I have to be at the airport
two hours before the flight.

40:43.908 --> 40:46.206
I really wish we could have
spent more time together.

40:46.243 --> 40:48.006
I wish we could, too,
but, you know,

40:48.112 --> 40:50.410
I'll be back soon enough,
this time with Brandon's father.

40:50.448 --> 40:53.212
I just have to go upstairs
and get a few things together.

40:53.250 --> 40:55.241
Go to it, Mom.

41:04.495 --> 41:06.690
Kelly?

41:06.730 --> 41:08.095
What?

41:08.132 --> 41:10.498
Why are you being so cold to me?

41:10.534 --> 41:13.128
Why do you think, Colin?

41:13.170 --> 41:15.161
Come on, Kelly.

41:16.874 --> 41:19.206
Don't you, um, have
to go to the bathroom,

41:19.243 --> 41:21.268
or the little elves' room?

41:21.312 --> 41:22.779
I'm sorry.

41:22.813 --> 41:25.441
Look, I-I know
I broke a promise to you.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.144
Yeah, you did.

41:27.184 --> 41:30.085
You promised me this summer
that you wouldn't do it again.

41:31.755 --> 41:32.983
I wanted to believe you.

41:33.090 --> 41:35.615
It was just for the holiday.

41:35.659 --> 41:37.388
One gram.

41:37.428 --> 41:40.363
And it's gone.

41:40.397 --> 41:41.796
It's over.

41:43.234 --> 41:44.861
Can you forgive me?

41:44.902 --> 41:46.199
I can if you mean it.

41:46.237 --> 41:47.727
If you don't, don't lie to me.

41:47.771 --> 41:48.795
I'm not lying.

41:48.839 --> 41:50.670
Come on. It's Christmas.

41:52.009 --> 41:54.000
It was a stupid mistake.

41:55.079 --> 41:56.273
You know what?

41:56.313 --> 41:58.474
I-I don't know
what I was thinking.

41:59.884 --> 42:03.149
It'll never happen again.

42:03.187 --> 42:05.155
I promise, okay?

42:05.189 --> 42:08.056
Okay.

42:15.900 --> 42:17.333
I can't believe
you're leaving already.

42:17.368 --> 42:19.768
- I barely even got
to talk to you. - I know.

42:19.803 --> 42:21.361
- Give Jim our love.
- I will.

42:21.405 --> 42:23.498
And don't you guys
go scarfing up

42:23.541 --> 42:24.906
all the food before
I get back now.

42:26.010 --> 42:28.535
I love you all.

42:29.647 --> 42:31.512
Merry Christmas.

42:31.549 --> 42:32.641
Have a happy,

42:32.683 --> 42:34.412
- healthy new year.
- You, too.

42:40.558 --> 42:42.617
Bye, everybody.

42:42.660 --> 42:43.752
Bye.

42:49.867 --> 42:51.835
Wait a minute, Brandon.

42:51.869 --> 42:53.837
What'd you forget, Mom?

42:53.871 --> 42:55.304
I didn't forget anything.

42:55.339 --> 42:56.897
I just want to stand here

42:56.941 --> 42:58.909
for a moment and remember
all the good times

42:58.943 --> 43:00.706
your father and I had
in this house.

43:00.744 --> 43:03.406
You know, I'm really glad
you're going back to Dad.

43:03.447 --> 43:05.506
You guys both owe it
to each other

43:05.549 --> 43:07.517
to try to work this out.

43:07.551 --> 43:11.214
It's easy to forget sometimes
how much we do love each other.

43:13.791 --> 43:16.191
I miss this place every day.

43:16.226 --> 43:18.786
But I did learn
something from this

43:18.829 --> 43:21.389
three-day midlife crisis.

43:21.432 --> 43:23.798
For me, home...

43:23.834 --> 43:27.133
is where your father is.

43:27.171 --> 43:29.298
Let's get a move on.

43:29.340 --> 43:31.069
This is one plane
I don't want to miss.

43:31.108 --> 43:32.268
Yeah.
