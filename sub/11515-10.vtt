11:33.986 --> 11:36.989
Susan's gone dark.
Her timing is suspicious.

11:37.114 --> 11:41.535
Come now.
Clone cures, implanted tech.

11:41.619 --> 11:44.372
All that Neo intrigue can wait,

11:44.455 --> 11:45.790
- can it not?
- Don't.

11:48.125 --> 11:51.212
Pleasure first, business second,
remember?

11:54.048 --> 11:55.716
I like the cane.

11:56.300 --> 11:57.385
Elegant.

11:57.468 --> 11:59.261
Multipurpose.

11:59.345 --> 12:00.679
I'm not the same.

12:03.557 --> 12:06.143

12:07.978 --> 12:10.398
I don't feel much of anything anymore.

12:14.485 --> 12:15.528
(SCOFFS)

12:16.821 --> 12:19.156
I spent a great deal of time

12:20.074 --> 12:23.452
and I lost a great deal of money

12:23.536 --> 12:25.246

12:28.165 --> 12:31.252

Cosima's cut off
in the Neolution power vacuum,

13:16.922 --> 13:18.799
and he calls in a beautician?

13:18.883 --> 13:20.134

13:24.263 --> 13:25.723
Hello, Krystal.

13:26.724 --> 13:27.933
Hello, yourself.

13:28.434 --> 13:32.813
So what's this intel you've got
on Delphine and Van Lier?

13:32.897 --> 13:34.023
It's life or death.

13:34.106 --> 13:35.858
Is it?
'Cause I basically don't believe

13:35.941 --> 13:37.651
anything you're saying right now.

13:37.735 --> 13:39.528
Are you guys even for real?

13:39.612 --> 13:42.323
(STAMMERING) Yeah! If you have
any questions, we're happy to help.

13:42.406 --> 13:44.158
Krystal, we talked about this.

13:44.241 --> 13:47.203
And we told you that the less you know,
the better. Remember?

13:47.286 --> 13:50.039
Well, that's not good enough
for me anymore. Okay?

13:50.122 --> 13:52.500
If you want the scoop on Van Lier,

13:52.583 --> 13:54.183
you're gonna have to tell me everything.

13:55.586 --> 13:56.587

I warn you, Krystal,
this is gonna come as a bit of a shock.

Okay, like,
nothing shocks me nowadays, so...

14:08.933 --> 14:11.936
Oh, this is way more realistic. Yes.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.439
Hello, you. You look nice.

14:15.523 --> 14:16.607
Well, thank you, Krystal.

KRYSTAL: (CHUCKLES)
You're welcome.

14:18.609 --> 14:20.569
There's someone
we think you should meet.

14:21.320 --> 14:23.197
SARAH: Oi, I'm over here.

14:25.616 --> 14:26.700
FELIX: I tried. I did.

14:26.784 --> 14:27.785
Right.

14:28.285 --> 14:30.412
- Hi, who are you?
- I'm Sarah.

14:30.496 --> 14:32.831
I'm, uh, your clone.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.004
Okay, clones like...

14:39.088 --> 14:42.758
Like genetic identicals, made in a lab.

14:45.803 --> 14:48.430
Right. Oh, this is what
you think I look like?

14:49.557 --> 14:51.058
- ART: Pretty much.
- Yeah.

14:51.141 --> 14:52.893
(CHUCKLES)
Okay, are you, like, blind?

14:52.977 --> 14:55.563
'Cause this girl looks nothing like me.

14:55.646 --> 14:57.773
Like, first of all,
my tits are way bigger.

14:57.856 --> 15:00.296
And secondly, even if you could
drag a comb through that hair,

15:00.359 --> 15:02.903
she's like a seven on a good day
and I've been told I'm a ten.

15:04.655 --> 15:05.948
A seven?

15:06.031 --> 15:07.408
She has a point about your hair.

15:07.491 --> 15:09.827
Okay, so, you guys, at this point,

15:09.910 --> 15:12.621
have literally no idea what's going on.
It's so cute.

15:12.705 --> 15:15.583
So let me lay it out
for you straight, okay?

15:15.666 --> 15:18.252
This is about human experiments,

15:18.335 --> 15:21.005
and two factions
fighting to control them.

15:22.339 --> 15:23.465
Shit, that's right.

15:23.549 --> 15:24.758
- Oh.
- KRYSTAL: Right?

15:24.842 --> 15:27.261
So we have Estee Lauder, okay?

15:27.344 --> 15:30.514
And then we have
this Swedish company called Neolution.

15:31.682 --> 15:34.643
- It's crazy how right you are.
- Thank you.

15:34.727 --> 15:37.080
Krystal, do you think you can
elaborate just a little bit more?

15:37.104 --> 15:39.189
Give us a few more details?

15:39.273 --> 15:40.608
Absolutely.

15:40.691 --> 15:43.986
But, like, hold on tight,
'cause this is very confusing.

15:44.069 --> 15:47.281
So, Dr. Van Lier is absolutely Neolution

15:47.364 --> 15:49.116
because he, like,
showed up out of nowhere

15:49.199 --> 15:50.951
with all this medical gear,

15:51.035 --> 15:53.871
like, right after that
French doctor was shot. Okay?

15:53.954 --> 15:56.290
And then they, like,
took her off in a van.

15:56.373 --> 15:58.709
Wait, Van Lier is the one
who saved Delphine?

15:59.710 --> 16:01.503
I'm sorry, who are you, again?

16:02.546 --> 16:04.048
I'm Sarah. I'm your clone.

16:05.382 --> 16:06.383
Right, whatever.

16:06.467 --> 16:09.303
So Van Lier, like, knew my name,

16:09.386 --> 16:10.512
which was super freaky.

16:10.596 --> 16:12.514
And I will never forget his face

16:12.598 --> 16:16.352
'cause he was so pissed at me
for being there.

16:16.435 --> 16:18.312
And 'cause he definitely
had teenage acne.

16:19.104 --> 16:21.023
I could tell. No question.

16:21.106 --> 16:22.691
Uh, thank you for that, Krystal.

16:22.775 --> 16:25.575
Um, you know, there's actually something
you could really help us with.

16:26.570 --> 16:28.238
KRYSTAL: (CHUCKLES) Okay.

16:28.906 --> 16:31.992
Neolution's wars of succession
are fought over science.

16:32.076 --> 16:33.369
There's an opportunity here.

16:33.452 --> 16:35.371
You haven't gone all Neo on me,
have you?

16:35.454 --> 16:37.665

She's excited.

17:29.550 --> 17:31.176
Something's going on.

SUSAN: It's tremendous,
and it only gets better.

Yes, we will trial the cure
on them both.

17:39.351 --> 17:41.478
But it's the cell generation rates,

17:41.562 --> 17:43.480
they far surpassed expectations.

17:43.564 --> 17:46.233
I have only seen
numbers like this once before.

mean to you.

22:24.636 --> 22:25.721
MRS. S: Rachel?

22:25.804 --> 22:27.055
Neolution has a board?

22:27.639 --> 22:29.891
There's always a bloody board.

22:42.362 --> 22:43.822
Gentlemen,

22:43.905 --> 22:45.240
ladies.

22:45.323 --> 22:48.452
Thank you so much
for moving this meeting up.

22:48.535 --> 22:52.330
There are moments
which simply cannot wait.

22:52.456 --> 22:53.874
Congratulations.

22:55.042 --> 22:57.627
Human cloning is back on the table.

23:00.797 --> 23:01.798
FELIX: Rachel?

23:06.970 --> 23:10.015
Where the hell are you,
you horrible bitch?

23:10.140 --> 23:12.309
Damn. Wrong bitch.

23:13.810 --> 23:15.854
This isn't what it looks like.

23:15.979 --> 23:18.065
(FELIX TUTTING)

23:18.148 --> 23:19.399
Oh, Ira.

23:21.234 --> 23:22.486
Where's Rachel?

23:24.821 --> 23:27.282
We're all familiar
with Susan's experiments.

23:27.365 --> 23:31.078
Her patient contribution
to our understanding

23:31.161 --> 23:33.747
of epigenetics in human evolution.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.375
Well, I am not my mother,

23:38.418 --> 23:42.422
and if our goal is genetic change
in the general population,

23:42.506 --> 23:45.467
I want to see it within my lifetime.

23:45.550 --> 23:48.095
This is exactly what Evie promised.

23:48.178 --> 23:50.305
Yes, but Evie had no baseline,

23:51.515 --> 23:54.017
and Susan has no balls.

23:54.851 --> 23:57.896
So let's talk clones, shall we?

23:58.939 --> 24:02.359
We have a saying.
"Neolution follows the science."

24:03.068 --> 24:05.987
But it doesn't throw the deformed baby
out with the bathwater,

24:06.071 --> 24:07.447
if you know what I mean.

24:07.531 --> 24:09.116
We're listening.

24:09.199 --> 24:13.120
Clones are wholly patented,
farmed and monitored lab animals.

24:13.203 --> 24:17.958
We can now produce them
generation after generation.

24:18.041 --> 24:21.461
So I propose we marry
the best of both worlds.

24:21.545 --> 24:25.632
Susan's baseline with
Evie Cho's implanted tech.

24:26.133 --> 24:28.301
Rachel wants to put bots in clones?

24:28.385 --> 24:29.970
In multiple generations.

24:30.053 --> 24:32.889
You clones are so much more
than the sum of your parts.

24:32.973 --> 24:37.144
We operate in countries
where human cloning is not illegal,

24:37.227 --> 24:39.896
where our corporation supersedes

24:39.980 --> 24:42.983
their citizenship, their personhood.

24:43.441 --> 24:46.570
So why grant them
this illusion of freedom?

24:47.654 --> 24:51.241
If we want to know if
our lab rats' tails will grow back,

24:51.324 --> 24:54.828
we damn well will cut them off and see!

24:57.372 --> 24:58.874
(SPRAY CAN HISSING)

25:03.003 --> 25:05.547
I have to say,
this is some of your finest work, Felix.

25:05.922 --> 25:07.340
Thank you, Arthur.

25:07.424 --> 25:08.675
I do respect your opinion.

IRA: (STAMMERS) Excuse me.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.095
What am I doing in this place?

25:14.264 --> 25:16.141
Oh, I've seen you before.

25:16.266 --> 25:17.434
Krystal.

25:18.435 --> 25:20.246
Krystal would kick your balls
into your throat.

25:20.270 --> 25:21.438
Oh, it's you.

25:23.273 --> 25:24.816
I know where Rachel's going.

25:31.114 --> 25:33.241
<i>because she wants to control
the whole cell line.</i>

25:33.325 --> 25:35.076
She wants to cut Susan out.

25:35.160 --> 25:36.870
No, Susan won't allow it.

25:36.953 --> 25:39.581
Have you heard this?
"Neolution follows the science"?

25:40.832 --> 25:42.709
Have you heard that?

25:43.627 --> 25:45.212
- Answer her, Ira.
- Come on!

25:45.295 --> 25:46.379
- Yes.
- SARAH: Right.

25:46.463 --> 25:47.881
Well, that's what Rachel's doing.

25:47.964 --> 25:50.550
She's going to the island
to follow it, okay?

25:50.634 --> 25:52.052
And you know...

25:52.135 --> 25:54.346
You know what she's capable of.

25:55.805 --> 25:57.474
Look, I know you care about Susan.

25:57.557 --> 25:58.558
FELIX: Oh, yeah.

25:58.642 --> 26:00.060
They're shagging.

26:01.811 --> 26:03.647
She's all alone out there.

26:03.730 --> 26:05.565

isn't it?

No, no.
It's because it's Cosima.
