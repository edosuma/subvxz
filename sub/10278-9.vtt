E. R.

00:07.574 --> 00:09.092
Previously on E. R.

00:09.304 --> 00:12.532
Will you love the baby
if the father is black?

00:14.325 --> 00:15.548
That's what I thought.

00:15.549 --> 00:17.999
I'm sorry, Kerry. I misread this.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.683
I'm so sorry if
I gave you the wrong impression.

00:20.684 --> 00:22.963
- You can't be here.
- They're gonna kill me! I'm dead!

00:22.964 --> 00:25.661
Come on. Get in the car.
I'll figure out something.

00:25.762 --> 00:27.712
- You're pregnant.
- Well, that's impossible.

00:27.713 --> 00:31.354
- What's the survival rate?
- I'm afraid the tumor is inoperable.

00:33.187 --> 00:37.216
I want to give him up for adoption,
but I need your permission to do it.

00:38.384 --> 00:41.468
If you're just waking up, give yourself
extra time to get to work.

00:41.636 --> 00:42.964
They didn't plow my street.

00:43.137 --> 00:46.755
First snowfall, they always take
three days to get their act together.

00:46.932 --> 00:50.134
- God, it's freezing outside.
- Any trouble getting in?

00:50.309 --> 00:53.512
No, I didn't even bother with my car.
I just took the El.

00:53.687 --> 00:57.518
- John, what are you still doing here?
- Five-car pileup on the expressway.

00:57.690 --> 00:59.812
- How many did we get?
- Six out of eight.

00:59.983 --> 01:03.647
Three to O.R., two to SICU,
one on a monitored bed.

01:03.819 --> 01:05.610
Spent the last four hours
catching up.

01:05.779 --> 01:09.527
- How'd our temp attending do?
- Worthless. Carter kept the board running.

01:09.699 --> 01:12.699
Thank you, Haleh. What happened
to the attending we had last week?

01:12.868 --> 01:16.366
- Took a job in the Bahamas.
- Knew he was too smart for this place.

01:16.537 --> 01:18.992
- Where do you need me?
- We're through the thick of it.

01:19.164 --> 01:22.579
Those are the dispos.
I signed out the rest to Malucci.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.703
Will you give Mr. Phelps a Bactrim
and discharge him?

01:25.877 --> 01:28.431
- Yeah.
- Thank you. And I think I am out of here.

01:29.171 --> 01:32.789
John, I'm sorry that I put you
on nights so soon...

01:32.966 --> 01:34.875
...but with Mark gone,
the schedule's a mess.

01:35.051 --> 01:36.545
We all do our share of nights.

01:36.719 --> 01:37.999
- Have you heard from him?
- Mark?

01:38.220 --> 01:39.678
No. They got there Tuesday.

01:39.846 --> 01:42.515
I didn't want to call.
And if it's good news, we'll know.

01:43.557 --> 01:45.929
Well, I will see you
at 4:00 this afternoon.

01:46.101 --> 01:49.385
- Make it 5:00. We'll cover for you.
- Thanks.

02:47.729 --> 02:50.765
- Anesthesiologist is on his way.
- How long?

02:50.940 --> 02:52.019
A couple of minutes.

02:52.191 --> 02:55.476
Jing-Mei, I'm gonna need you
to relax for a second. Okay?

02:55.652 --> 02:57.608
Okay.

03:00.614 --> 03:03.448
Yeah, I know. I know.

03:04.617 --> 03:07.104
Dilated at 4 centimeters.

03:07.161 --> 03:10.985
Completely effaced. Zero station.

03:11.163 --> 03:15.076
Start the Pitocin at two per minute
and up it every 20 minutes.

03:17.459 --> 03:20.744
- Is it okay to come in?
- Oh, John.

03:20.920 --> 03:23.411
- John, I'm so sorry to call you.
- That's okay.

03:23.589 --> 03:26.459
I waited as long as I could.
I didn't want to wake you.

03:26.633 --> 03:28.921
- Don't worry. I'm not working.
- Jing-Mei...

03:29.135 --> 03:32.005
...I'm going to rupture your membranes
to help move you along.

03:32.179 --> 03:34.384
- When did you go into labor?
- Midnight.

03:34.555 --> 03:36.843
- Where?
- Home. I took a cab.

03:37.015 --> 03:38.046
All done.

03:40.101 --> 03:44.892
You know, I thought I could do
this myself, but I can't. I can't.

03:45.063 --> 03:47.814
Hey, it's okay. You don't have to.

03:49.024 --> 03:50.767
Contraction?

03:50.942 --> 03:54.607
Okay. Squeeze my hand.
Yeah, squeeze my hand.

03:54.779 --> 03:56.652
You're doing great, Jing-Mei.

03:56.822 --> 03:59.229
We'll get the epidural working soon.

03:59.407 --> 04:02.822
Have you taken any birthing classes?
Lamaze? Bradley?

04:02.993 --> 04:07.239
Which one? Lamaze? Okay.

04:07.413 --> 04:09.322
Take a good, deep breath.

04:09.498 --> 04:11.869
In, in...

05:02.537 --> 05:03.651
E. R.

05:12.662 --> 05:14.405
Peter.

05:15.247 --> 05:16.789
Peter?

05:17.791 --> 05:19.533
Yeah.

05:20.458 --> 05:22.285
Listen.

05:23.961 --> 05:25.075
What?

05:25.254 --> 05:27.293
Voices.

05:27.505 --> 05:29.711
It's Kynesha.

05:30.590 --> 05:32.915
Talking to herself?

05:33.092 --> 05:36.127
She's probably just watching TV.

05:36.553 --> 05:38.130
- Peter.
- What?

05:38.304 --> 05:40.213
You brought her here.

05:40.389 --> 05:42.296
Go.

05:46.434 --> 05:48.675
No, you don't know.
This girl stay uptight.

05:48.852 --> 05:51.259
Can't be too uptight,
lets you stay here by yourself.

05:51.438 --> 05:53.477
Get mad every time I turn on a light.

05:53.648 --> 05:56.682
Place this nice, she worried
about the electric bill.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.185
Sure has straight teeth.

05:59.401 --> 06:02.983
- Who are you?
- I was just looking at it.

06:03.154 --> 06:04.434
Where's Kynesha?

06:04.613 --> 06:07.185
- Hey, Dr. Benton.
- Kynesha, who's this?

06:07.656 --> 06:09.315
- This is Tiny.
- Hey.

06:09.491 --> 06:11.898
Tiny got locked out.
Her sister ain't coming home till 7.

06:13.493 --> 06:15.402
- You went out?
- No.

06:15.662 --> 06:17.819
So somebody else is wearing
your boots now?

06:18.580 --> 06:19.908
I went to check on my mom.

06:20.081 --> 06:23.116
Tiny said she came back, was looking
for me. Was pretty messed up.

06:23.667 --> 06:26.418
- All right. You live in her building?
- Yeah.

06:26.585 --> 06:28.459
Grab your stuff.
I'll take you home.

06:28.670 --> 06:31.586
Kynesha, you better clean this up
before Cleo comes down.

06:34.924 --> 06:38.921
Okay. There. You have your coffee.
Now let's go.

06:40.511 --> 06:45.254
I don't want to keep this man waiting.
He's jammed us into his schedule.

06:45.472 --> 06:48.556
- What is it?
- The kid with the red hat.

06:48.725 --> 06:50.053
What about him?

06:50.226 --> 06:55.265
I saw another kid wearing
that exact hat three weeks ago.

06:55.729 --> 06:58.219
I was buying groceries
for Thanksgiving dinner.

06:59.357 --> 07:01.514
Now I'm in New York
waiting for a miracle.

07:04.526 --> 07:07.099
Maybe it's a sign.

07:07.487 --> 07:10.191
Either that or the Grim Reaper
wears a red hat.

07:10.364 --> 07:12.486
I didn't come with you
to hear talk like that.

07:12.657 --> 07:16.106
- I thought that was healthy.
- Well, it's not.

07:16.284 --> 07:19.070
I should just stick with denial?

07:19.369 --> 07:20.863
I'd prefer guarded optimism...

07:21.037 --> 07:24.156
...until Dr. Burke maps the brain
and gives us his opinion.

07:24.331 --> 07:26.822
Yeah, and then I can hear
bad news twice.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.367
If you really believed that,
you'd have called Rachel by now.

07:30.543 --> 07:32.582
Just call her up and tell her
over the phone?

07:32.753 --> 07:37.330
No, you could have flown out there
for a day, but you didn't. Why?

07:37.882 --> 07:39.505
I have a feeling you'll tell me.

07:39.716 --> 07:43.629
Yes, because deep down, you really do
believe this surgeon can help you.

07:43.802 --> 07:46.636
You don't want to tell her
until you know you'll be all right.

07:46.804 --> 07:48.263
Or I'm desperate.

07:48.722 --> 07:51.805
You've seen enough patients overcome
illnesses they shouldn't have...

07:51.974 --> 07:54.464
...to understand the importance
of a positive outlook.

07:54.642 --> 07:57.215
Now, you have to believe it's possible.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.684
I think I'm a little nervous.

08:04.023 --> 08:06.099
Well, me too.

08:10.236 --> 08:13.320
- Heart rate is 150 with type-1 dips.
- Is that a normal decel?

08:13.488 --> 08:15.444
Yeah. It's good cardiac activity.

08:15.614 --> 08:18.400
- I thought you got high honors in OB.
- I did.

08:18.575 --> 08:21.112
The adoptive parents are here.
Can I show them in?

08:21.285 --> 08:22.779
- Yes.
- No!

08:22.994 --> 08:25.401
They said they arranged
to be present for the birth.

08:25.580 --> 08:28.828
- John, do you mind?
- Yeah. I'll talk to them.

08:31.333 --> 08:33.658
Hi. You the adoptive parents?

08:33.835 --> 08:36.408
Yes. James and Linda.
You're the doctor?

08:36.587 --> 08:38.707
- I'm a friend of Deb's.
- Who?

08:38.962 --> 08:41.085
Jing-Mei. I'm John Carter.

08:41.756 --> 08:44.710
- Is there a problem?
- No. She's starting to push.

08:44.884 --> 08:47.125
Baby's healthy.
Could be any minute now.

08:47.761 --> 08:49.800
- We should get in there.
- Well...

08:49.970 --> 08:51.594
...she's feeling a little overwhelmed.

08:51.804 --> 08:53.796
She said we could be
present at the birth.

08:53.973 --> 08:55.087
I know.

08:55.265 --> 08:58.218
But labor can be demanding,
and she really needs to focus.

08:58.434 --> 09:00.889
We traveled all night
from Portland to get here.

09:01.103 --> 09:04.470
I understand. You can have a seat
right here.

09:05.605 --> 09:10.183
Is she changing her mind? About
giving the baby up for adoption?

09:10.359 --> 09:14.485
No, I think she's a little embarrassed.
Just wants a little privacy.

09:14.653 --> 09:18.103
Look, we really wanted to be there
for the birth of our son.

09:18.280 --> 09:21.150
I'll bring him right out to you.
I promise.

09:23.743 --> 09:26.113
Hey, I heard Dr. Chen's
having her baby upstairs.

09:26.285 --> 09:29.985
Malucci, Exam 1 's been here since 9
with reflux esophagitis.

09:30.163 --> 09:31.194
In a minute, chief.

09:31.372 --> 09:33.163
- Do you want to send her flowers?
- No.

09:33.332 --> 09:35.573
- I could start a pool.
- No. Leave her alone.

09:35.750 --> 09:38.785
- Why?
- Randi, can you just drop it, please?

09:38.960 --> 09:42.126
- Hi, Kim.
- Hi. You have a cyclothymic down here?

09:42.296 --> 09:46.506
Yeah. A guy in Exam 3 trying to
set a new world record doing sit-ups.

09:46.674 --> 09:50.373
- Got it.
- Hey, I tried to call you the other day-

09:50.551 --> 09:52.009
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

09:52.177 --> 09:55.012
My machine's been acting up.
I need to get a new one.

09:55.179 --> 09:59.093
I wish I'd known that sooner. I might
have gotten you something different.

09:59.558 --> 10:01.513
Merry Christmas.

10:02.642 --> 10:06.639
Yeah. I happened across a copy
over the weekend and couldn't resist.

10:06.812 --> 10:09.598
- Hopefully you don't already have one.
- Well, thank you.

10:09.814 --> 10:11.640
My pleasure.

10:13.149 --> 10:15.604
- Should I open it now?
- Or later.

10:15.776 --> 10:16.855
Okay.

10:18.194 --> 10:22.902
You should try drinking water
upside down. It always helps with me.

10:23.073 --> 10:25.029
- Yeah. Thank you.
- See you.

10:25.574 --> 10:27.482
You said one night. It's been a week.

10:27.659 --> 10:31.109
- What do you want me to do?
- Turn her over to Social Services.

10:31.286 --> 10:35.069
If her mother's been on a drug spree for
a month, she needs to be in foster care.

10:35.248 --> 10:38.330
She's 15 years old. She doesn't
want to go in the system now.

10:38.499 --> 10:41.499
- Well, I'm not adopting her. Are you?
- No, of course not.

10:41.668 --> 10:44.834
I hate her being in my house alone.
Now she's bringing friends over?

10:45.087 --> 10:47.044
I'm sorry. That won't happen again.

10:47.546 --> 10:49.206
Peter, she's manipulating you.

10:49.840 --> 10:53.788
I got a lead on another halfway house.
I'll make sure she gets into that one.

10:54.134 --> 10:56.885
Two more days. After that, she's out.

10:57.845 --> 11:00.595
- Cleo, I'm working on it.
- Good.

11:00.763 --> 11:04.712
LFTs are back on Room 4.
Bilirubin's a little high.

11:08.352 --> 11:11.885
I need help, please! Help me!
Someone help me, please!

11:12.062 --> 11:13.853
- What happened?
- A dog attacked my son.

11:14.022 --> 11:16.180
He's bitten all over.
I can't stop the bleeding.

11:16.357 --> 11:18.563
- What's his name?
- Oh, God! It looks worse.

11:18.734 --> 11:21.058
Laceration through and through.
Cut his facial artery.

11:21.277 --> 11:24.442
- What's your son's name?
- Jeff. He was crying, but now he's quiet.

11:24.654 --> 11:25.852
Jeff, I'm Dr. Weaver.

11:26.030 --> 11:27.737
We need to secure his airway.
What's open?

11:27.906 --> 11:29.186
- Trauma 1.
- Come on.

11:29.366 --> 11:30.397
Get him on a monitor.

11:30.575 --> 11:33.148
I need suction and a Pedes intubation kit.

11:33.327 --> 11:35.401
Throw up 40 of sux and five of Versed.

11:35.619 --> 11:37.327
- Cutdown tray.
- Pulse ox is 86.

11:37.537 --> 11:40.407
- Ten liters blow-by.
- I need four-by-fours, Merocel sponges.

11:40.623 --> 11:42.366
- Sats are dropping.
- I need to intubate.

11:42.541 --> 11:45.660
I think I can control it.
Let me get some suction here.

11:45.835 --> 11:48.704
- Ma'am, I need some room.
- Step back, please.

11:48.878 --> 11:51.084
Damn it. If only I can
tie off this bleeder.

11:51.255 --> 11:53.128
Heart rate's up to 120. Pulse ox is 82.

11:53.340 --> 11:55.664
Not getting enough oxygen.
We have to intubate.

11:55.842 --> 11:58.591
- Why aren't you helping him?!
- Got it!

12:00.177 --> 12:03.462
Blow hard. Three, two, one.

12:03.680 --> 12:06.929
Okay, one more should do it.
I don't want to use suction. All right?

12:07.099 --> 12:10.098
- I thought you said he was crowning.
- He is. Just one more push.

12:11.059 --> 12:13.763
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. Just one more push.

12:13.936 --> 12:16.177
You're doing great. You're doing great.

12:16.355 --> 12:20.517
Ten, nine, eight, push!
Seven, six...

12:20.691 --> 12:23.809
Okay, the head is out!
You can stop. Stop pushing.

12:27.153 --> 12:30.521
- Is it over?
- Almost.

12:31.948 --> 12:34.236
You did great. You did great.

12:34.408 --> 12:38.404
It's a boy. He's nice and healthy.
You want to hold him?

12:38.577 --> 12:41.743
- Wanna hold him?
- No.

12:42.205 --> 12:45.654
- You sure?
- Yes.

12:52.962 --> 12:54.871
I guess this was more
than you bargained for.

12:55.047 --> 12:57.962
- You did all the work.
- No, I mean having to see all this.

12:58.131 --> 13:01.879
It was a blur. Let's just say
we're closer now.

13:02.051 --> 13:05.134
Surprised you? I didn't tell you
about the father.

13:05.303 --> 13:07.342
Yeah, kind of.

13:08.596 --> 13:11.431
- Are those the adoptive parents?
- Yeah. You didn't meet them?

13:11.599 --> 13:15.761
- Yeah. About two months ago.
- They still want to come in and see you.

13:15.935 --> 13:18.260
What did they do when you
gave them the baby?

13:18.437 --> 13:20.096
They cried.

13:20.271 --> 13:22.595
- They seem nice to you?
- Yeah, they seem great.

13:22.773 --> 13:24.397
Here we are. Any nausea?

13:26.442 --> 13:27.521
Yeah, a little.

13:27.693 --> 13:31.143
All right. We'll give you some
ice chips until it passes.

13:31.320 --> 13:33.857
- You don't have to stick around.
- I'm fine.

13:34.030 --> 13:35.524
- You have a night shift?
- Later.

13:35.698 --> 13:39.279
Okay. Well, then you should go rest,
crash in the on-call room.

13:39.450 --> 13:41.739
- We'll see.
- All right. I'm gonna change your pad.

13:41.911 --> 13:44.910
Then we'll massage your uterus
to firm it up a bit.

13:45.079 --> 13:48.577
- You don't want to be around for that.
- Not really. You okay?

13:48.748 --> 13:52.365
All right, I'm gonna come back
and check on you later.

13:53.501 --> 13:54.876
- Hey, John?
- Yeah?

13:55.044 --> 13:58.293
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.374
The whole thing takes about an hour.

14:02.549 --> 14:04.707
You'll be doing language tasks...

14:04.884 --> 14:07.587
- ... as we map out the speech centers.
- Is Dr. Burke meeting us?

14:07.760 --> 14:08.791
He'll stop by.

14:08.969 --> 14:11.969
Usually you meet the surgeon
before he sends you off for a scan.

14:12.138 --> 14:14.759
Burke's one of the best in the world.
He's busy.

14:14.932 --> 14:17.932
Take off your glasses, watch, wallet,
pager, cell phone.

14:18.101 --> 14:20.637
Anything metal, anything magnetic,
right in here.

14:20.810 --> 14:23.135
Could you call Dr. Burke
and let him know we're here?

14:23.312 --> 14:25.600
He likes to be notified
when the renderings are up.

14:25.939 --> 14:27.812
So as not to waste time
with the patients.

14:27.982 --> 14:29.974
- Elizabeth.
- Don't forget the belt.

14:30.150 --> 14:32.521
You'll have earphones,
and we'll talk by intercom.

14:32.693 --> 14:35.100
Can I stay for the scan, then?
I am a surgeon myself.

14:35.278 --> 14:36.606
You can sit back there.

14:36.821 --> 14:38.778
For the first run, you'll name objects
you see projected on fiber-optic goggles.

14:38.948 --> 14:40.940
Do I get to shoot down any aliens?

14:41.116 --> 14:43.819
Will he have scars?

14:46.285 --> 14:47.400
Surgeons will do everything
they can to minimize them.

14:47.578 --> 14:50.033
- What are you doing here?!
- I am so sorry. I was worried.

14:50.205 --> 14:52.991
- He almost died, Mona!
- But he'll be all right?

14:53.165 --> 14:55.453
- You're putting that dog down!
- Mom?

14:55.625 --> 14:57.949
- What are you talking about?
- Maybe this isn't the right time.

14:58.168 --> 15:00.789
Jeff must have provoked him-

15:00.962 --> 15:04.081
That animal mauled my son.

15:04.256 --> 15:06.792
You're putting him down.
I want that animal destroyed!

15:06.965 --> 15:09.123
- Shelly, I-
- You better leave it alone for now.

15:09.300 --> 15:12.668
Mom? Are they gonna kill Winston?

15:13.095 --> 15:14.126
I don't know, honey.

15:14.304 --> 15:17.753
Why don't we find a place for you
to sit down? Here we go.

15:18.806 --> 15:21.297
There's good hemostasis.
The repeat crit is 39.

15:21.475 --> 15:24.096
- Great, Peter. Thanks.
- Yeah.

15:42.655 --> 15:46.818
Hey. You're not supposed
to be in there.

15:46.992 --> 15:48.485
What's your name?

15:48.660 --> 15:51.825
- Taylor.
- Well, come on out here, Taylor.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.863
I hurt my foot.

15:55.664 --> 15:57.656
If you come out here,
I can take a look at it.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.158
I'm a doctor.

16:02.669 --> 16:07.412
Okay. Let's take a look.

16:09.173 --> 16:12.754
Are you a patient here?
Let me see this.

16:12.967 --> 16:15.837
Hey, you're supposed to be
up in the blood bank.

16:17.052 --> 16:20.337
- You having a blood transfusion?
- I don't like needles.

16:21.014 --> 16:22.673
Yeah, well, none of us do...

16:22.848 --> 16:25.683
...but sometimes we gotta use them
to make you feel better.

16:25.851 --> 16:30.510
- I'm not sick. Nicole is.
- Who's Nicole?

16:30.853 --> 16:34.268
She's my sister. She has leukemia.

16:36.566 --> 16:38.357
And you're donating bone marrow.

16:39.234 --> 16:43.147
I did that when I was little.
Now they want to take all my blood...

16:43.320 --> 16:46.735
- ... and wash it through a machine.
- Yeah, I see.

16:46.906 --> 16:51.199
Every time Nicole gets sick,
I have to go to the hospital too.

16:52.325 --> 16:56.536
I tell you what. You come with me,
I'll make your foot feel better.

16:57.413 --> 17:00.781
- You won't take my blood out?
- No. Come on.

17:01.207 --> 17:03.033
Come on.

17:12.798 --> 17:13.829
Where are my shoes?

17:14.007 --> 17:17.255
I didn't mean to make you feel
uncomfortable. Just think about it.

17:17.425 --> 17:19.915
I have thought about it.

17:20.094 --> 17:22.335
- What's up?
- John, I'm leaving.

17:22.512 --> 17:23.791
Can you give me a ride home?

17:23.972 --> 17:26.047
You can't leave until
Dr. Coburn gets here.

17:26.223 --> 17:28.179
I'll sign out AMA. Just get the form.

17:28.348 --> 17:31.053
We keep all postpartum
mothers for 24 hours.

17:31.226 --> 17:35.092
- Well, I'm not a mother.
- I suggested she see the baby.

17:35.271 --> 17:36.729
John, can we leave, please?

17:36.897 --> 17:40.311
They observe you for a reason, Deb.
I think you should sit down and relax.

17:40.482 --> 17:43.684
- I'll come back for a blood test.
- Don't run away from this, Jing-Mei.

17:43.859 --> 17:46.397
It's better for the adoptive parents,
better for you...

17:46.570 --> 17:49.985
...if you meet your son,
hold him, say goodbye.

17:51.364 --> 17:54.317
- I don't think I can.
- Can what?

17:54.491 --> 17:56.863
Say goodbye.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.321
Last run is word fluency.

18:03.497 --> 18:06.070
For each object,
name an action that goes with it.

18:06.249 --> 18:09.202
If you see a dog,
you might say, "bark. "

18:09.376 --> 18:10.407
Okey-dokey.

18:10.627 --> 18:12.666
Okay, here we go.

18:13.962 --> 18:16.084
It grows.

18:17.089 --> 18:19.377
Sweeps.

18:19.549 --> 18:20.580
Live in it.

18:22.426 --> 18:23.755
Writes.

18:24.761 --> 18:26.918
Blossoms.

18:27.096 --> 18:30.345
Hey, Marty.
Is this the frontal GBM?

18:30.515 --> 18:33.764
Baseline scans are up,
but not the functional renderings.

18:33.934 --> 18:35.843
Burke's not gonna want
to cut this one out.

18:36.060 --> 18:38.265
- I'll take him.
- For the Carboplatin trial?

18:38.436 --> 18:40.559
- Yeah.
- No, you had the parietal GBM for that.

18:40.730 --> 18:42.307
He's a good Gamma Knife candidate.

18:42.481 --> 18:44.473
Best you can offer
is a 12-month survival.

18:44.649 --> 18:46.855
We see up to 14
with an intra-arterial protocol.

18:47.026 --> 18:49.432
Yeah, and what an enjoyable
two months it is. Hello?

18:49.610 --> 18:50.641
It slithers.

18:50.819 --> 18:55.445
I'll be right up. SVC Syndrome in the
unit. We'll duke it out in tumor board.

18:55.615 --> 18:56.646
Sticks you.

18:56.824 --> 18:59.990
- Page me when the renderings come up.
- Dr. Burke gets the first look.

19:00.160 --> 19:01.949
No, he won't be interested.

19:02.118 --> 19:04.157
Entomb.

19:05.329 --> 19:07.072
Hang.

19:07.247 --> 19:08.527
All done. I'll be right in.

19:08.707 --> 19:10.663
"REST"

19:10.833 --> 19:11.947
How'd I do?

19:16.294 --> 19:18.452
How'd I do?

19:19.088 --> 19:20.665
You did brilliantly, Mark.

19:29.345 --> 19:32.131
- Can I go home after this?
- We'll see.

19:32.305 --> 19:35.838
Cleo, you have a call on two. A girl named
Kynesha, something about your car.

19:36.015 --> 19:39.218
- My car?
- She was talking really fast.

19:43.563 --> 19:45.638
Kynesha?

19:46.815 --> 19:50.941
Just gone? Did you see anybody?

19:51.901 --> 19:55.020
- I'll call the police. Stay near the phone.
- What happened?

19:55.195 --> 19:58.978
Kynesha says my car is missing,
didn't see anything.

19:59.489 --> 20:01.777
Chicago Police Department.
Main number, please.

20:01.949 --> 20:04.274
- Always the diplomat, Peter!
- What?

20:04.451 --> 20:06.242
Dr. Duhlstrom just called me, ranting.

20:06.411 --> 20:09.364
Says you stole one of his leukocyte
donors, and you won't give it back.

20:09.538 --> 20:12.656
It was a little girl that I found
scared, hiding under the stairs.

20:12.831 --> 20:14.076
Finders keepers? Is that it?

20:14.249 --> 20:16.205
She cut her foot.
I told him to send her parents down.

20:16.417 --> 20:19.666
If you hadn't hung up on Duhlstrom,
you'd know Dad is picking up Grandma...

20:19.836 --> 20:23.583
...and Mom's a little busy with the other
daughter puking her guts out from chemo.

20:23.755 --> 20:26.708
Do me a favor. Hurry up,
suture the foot and ship her upstairs.

20:26.924 --> 20:29.592
Has anyone bothered to explain
the procedure to this girl?

20:29.801 --> 20:31.176
They've done
a few hundred of these.

20:31.385 --> 20:34.054
Well, she's scared right now
and feeling a little used.

20:34.262 --> 20:38.258
That's terrible. You know, the sister's
a little scared too. She's scared of dying!

20:38.681 --> 20:40.306
It's not like they're trying
to take out a lung.

20:40.474 --> 20:43.391
Well, she has point tenderness
over the distal malleolus.

20:43.560 --> 20:45.848
You want to play ER doc, fine.
I'll tell you what.

20:46.020 --> 20:49.019
I'll tell the mother to abandon her child
upstairs, come and calm this kid down.

20:49.188 --> 20:51.939
But if she is not strapped in
for leukapheresis by 2:30...

20:52.107 --> 20:53.606
...I'm strapping you in.

20:58.824 --> 20:59.986
What did she say?

21:00.158 --> 21:03.443
She said that she would see him,
but she doesn't really want to.

21:04.120 --> 21:06.692
Are you sure that you want
to force this on her?

21:07.414 --> 21:10.663
We have three days until
she has to sign the papers.

21:10.833 --> 21:13.584
And if she doesn't see him,
she might regret it...

21:13.752 --> 21:16.324
...and then change her mind about
the whole adoption.

21:16.796 --> 21:18.455
Okay. Well, she's waiting.

21:19.339 --> 21:22.707
Why don't you bring him in to her,
and the Reeds and I will follow...

21:22.883 --> 21:26.133
...in a few minutes so that Jing-Mei
can hand the baby back to Linda.

21:30.180 --> 21:31.343
Okay.

21:33.266 --> 21:35.507
I got him.

21:37.311 --> 21:38.721
Okay.

21:48.652 --> 21:50.526
Ready?

22:11.419 --> 22:13.707
Oh, Carter...

22:14.922 --> 22:17.494
He's so beautiful.

22:23.511 --> 22:26.761
Hey... Hey.

22:30.058 --> 22:33.640
Hope it's like a jury. The longer they
deliberate, the better chance I have...

22:33.811 --> 22:36.764
- ... of getting off.
- They could still be waiting for Burke.

22:36.938 --> 22:39.013
I'm starting to think
that he doesn't exist.

22:39.190 --> 22:41.395
Maybe he only meets people
that he can help.

22:41.566 --> 22:45.349
- Mark.
- I know, I know. Positive. Positive.

22:46.153 --> 22:49.486
That MRI tech sure thought
I was a goner.

22:49.864 --> 22:52.699
He just runs the machine.
He can't offer a prognosis.

22:52.866 --> 22:57.860
Come on. You know that those techs can
read a scan better than most surgeons.

22:58.037 --> 23:00.076
No offense.

23:04.417 --> 23:09.658
- Do you want to get something to eat?
- No. No. Nope. No.

23:18.677 --> 23:21.677
Can't believe they call it
a tumor board.

23:21.846 --> 23:23.755
Why? They discuss tumors.

23:23.931 --> 23:26.338
I know, but...

23:26.516 --> 23:29.552
Think they'd come up with something
a little more esoteric.

23:29.727 --> 23:34.138
- Like what?
- I don't know, the...

23:34.522 --> 23:37.688
"You're completely boned" board.

23:41.527 --> 23:43.700
I heard they used to call it
the "poor bastard" board...

23:43.779 --> 23:46.852
...but too many people
were showing up.

23:47.031 --> 23:48.194
Someone told me...

23:48.366 --> 23:52.314
...heard they tried the "take me out back
and shoot me now" board for a while.

23:52.494 --> 23:54.818
- What, it didn't stick?
- No, surprisingly.

23:54.995 --> 23:58.862
- Why not?
- Too many letters, I guess.

23:59.457 --> 24:01.496
Pity.

24:06.587 --> 24:08.626
Elizabeth?

24:11.382 --> 24:14.051
Will you have the baby either way?

24:14.218 --> 24:16.091
What?

24:21.306 --> 24:27.008
If that man comes out of that room
and tells me he can't do anything...

24:28.603 --> 24:32.517
...that there's no way I can beat it...

24:33.399 --> 24:36.019
...will you still have the baby?

24:39.236 --> 24:40.647
Yes.

24:45.032 --> 24:48.198
I got a 12-year-old in 4 that
swallowed a pair of toenail clippers.

24:48.368 --> 24:50.277
I think he's gonna need to be scoped.

24:50.453 --> 24:51.911
- Are you okay?
- The hiccups.

24:52.079 --> 24:53.905
- I thought they went away.
- They did.

24:54.081 --> 24:56.286
- Teaspoon of sugar's supposed to help.
- It didn't.

24:56.457 --> 24:58.829
Is Luka coming back
on the 26th or the 27th?

24:59.001 --> 25:02.036
- The 26th, I think.
- Where'd he go? Croatia?

25:02.212 --> 25:04.251
Yeah, he went to visit
his dad for Christmas.

25:04.422 --> 25:07.837
Yo, my moms told me if you stand
on your head and swallow, hiccups gone.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.498
- Thanks, Malik.
- Hey, no problem. Works every time.

25:10.676 --> 25:11.956
Did you page me, Kerry?

25:12.136 --> 25:14.092
Yeah. We got a bad dog bite
in Trauma 2.

25:14.262 --> 25:17.262
Little kid who might need to be plugged
into some outpatient therapy.

25:17.431 --> 25:19.008
- Sure.
- Did you open it?

25:19.182 --> 25:20.760
- What?
- The present.

25:20.934 --> 25:22.677
No, not yet. No.

25:22.852 --> 25:24.974
- I'll go with you.
- Okay.

25:25.145 --> 25:27.303
- Do you want a shot of Reglan?
- For what?

25:27.480 --> 25:29.140
- Hiccups.
- No, they'll go away.

25:29.315 --> 25:32.730
- What about my toenail clippers?
- Malucci, get him.

25:32.901 --> 25:34.443
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:34.610 --> 25:35.808
You're here early.

25:35.986 --> 25:37.813
I was helping Chen with her baby.

25:37.988 --> 25:39.102
Was there a problem?

25:39.281 --> 25:40.988
No. Well, she didn't have a coach.

25:41.157 --> 25:42.864
You were her coach?

25:43.033 --> 25:46.069
- How'd you do?
- I did fine. She had a rough time of it.

25:46.244 --> 25:47.868
- Should I-?
- She doesn't want visitors.

25:48.037 --> 25:50.325
I'll fill you in later.
I'm gonna catch some Z's-

25:50.497 --> 25:52.952
Dr. Carter! They told me
you were down here.

25:53.124 --> 25:56.290
She's breast-feeding! She gave
the baby back after seeing him...

25:56.460 --> 25:58.950
...we talked, then went back
to the nursery.

25:59.128 --> 26:01.286
Then the nurse says
she wants to breast-feed!

26:01.464 --> 26:04.036
Man, slow down. What?

26:04.216 --> 26:07.132
The nurse has to give the baby
back to her if she asks for him.

26:07.301 --> 26:08.961
So she did.

26:09.136 --> 26:13.298
- My wife is frantic.
- Okay. I'll talk to her.

26:13.514 --> 26:14.972
Is my dad coming?

26:15.140 --> 26:19.054
- I'm not sure.
- Your mom went to call him.

26:19.227 --> 26:20.804
Is that a problem?

26:20.978 --> 26:25.306
He's gonna kill me. I was gonna
put it back without him knowing.

26:25.481 --> 26:27.520
Put what back?

26:27.691 --> 26:31.558
- Is Winston gonna be okay?
- The dog?

26:31.986 --> 26:34.358
They're not gonna put him
to sleep, are they?

26:34.530 --> 26:36.320
That would be very sad.

26:36.990 --> 26:40.821
But any dog that would
attack you for no reason...

26:41.910 --> 26:43.155
Excuse me.

26:43.620 --> 26:45.991
- I didn't mean to.
- What?

26:47.998 --> 26:51.081
To open my Christmas present early.

26:51.459 --> 26:53.177
I knew what it was.

26:54.252 --> 26:55.663
A BB gun.

26:58.922 --> 27:01.543
Did you shoot at the dog?

27:02.050 --> 27:04.967
I was just trying it out.

27:05.427 --> 27:08.463
- Why would she need to breast-feed?
- It's not unusual.

27:08.638 --> 27:11.342
- Does she still have him?
- She's changing her mind. I know it.

27:11.515 --> 27:13.673
There's no need to panic.

27:13.850 --> 27:15.842
Why did we have to force her
to meet him?

27:16.018 --> 27:18.805
Linda, she's giving up her child.
There's a maternal instinct...

27:18.979 --> 27:22.181
...she can't avoid and shouldn't try to.
We'll give her some time...

27:22.356 --> 27:24.681
...and have you rock the baby
in front of her.

27:24.858 --> 27:26.435
- Won't that make it worse?
- No.

27:26.610 --> 27:29.812
She needs to know at a very basic
level that the baby will be loved.

27:29.987 --> 27:33.687
Can you talk with her? Find out
what's going on, what she's thinking?

27:33.865 --> 27:36.106
Yeah, I can try.

27:38.285 --> 27:41.202
I can't lose another baby.

27:42.871 --> 27:44.365
Deb?

27:47.083 --> 27:48.742
What are you doing?

27:51.419 --> 27:57.222
You know, they say breast-feeding
is good for them in the first 24 hours.

27:57.799 --> 28:00.550
It's mostly colostrum, which
boosts their immune system.

28:02.261 --> 28:04.549
Deb, are you having second thoughts?

28:07.223 --> 28:09.713
I've always had second thoughts.

28:09.891 --> 28:12.097
What's changed?

28:13.227 --> 28:15.515
I saw his face.

28:16.229 --> 28:19.977
I'm being selfish.
I have the money to raise him.

28:20.149 --> 28:22.556
There's no reason I can't.

28:22.734 --> 28:27.727
There's a couple out there who
desperately want to raise a child.

28:31.199 --> 28:33.985
And you're giving them a great gift.

28:35.410 --> 28:40.237
What happens 18 years from now?

28:40.914 --> 28:43.452
He shows up
looking for an explanation.

28:43.625 --> 28:45.581
Well, you tell him the truth,
you know?

28:45.751 --> 28:50.211
You tell him that you wanted to provide
the best home possible for him.

28:52.589 --> 28:55.294
Do I tell him I was a coward?

28:55.925 --> 28:59.175
That my bigoted parents were more
important to me than he was?

29:00.554 --> 29:03.258
Deb, I think that you gotta
take your family out of this.

29:04.932 --> 29:08.382
Now, if you want to keep the baby,
keep the baby.

29:09.602 --> 29:12.472
But if you don't, or you can't...

29:12.854 --> 29:15.309
...then you want to make sure
he goes to somebody...

29:15.481 --> 29:18.185
...who's gonna love him,
who's gonna want him.

29:19.026 --> 29:22.524
And know that you're
not abandoning your baby.

29:23.154 --> 29:25.644
You're creating a family.

29:31.285 --> 29:33.028
- Did you find it?
- Four blocks away...

29:33.203 --> 29:35.325
...with a burned-out clutch
and a busted headlight.

29:35.496 --> 29:37.737
You lucked out. They could
have completely stripped it.

29:37.915 --> 29:39.243
My car wasn't stolen...

29:39.416 --> 29:42.120
...by a thief who
doesn't know how to drive a stick.

29:42.293 --> 29:44.748
Kynesha and her friend
took the car out for a joy ride.

29:44.920 --> 29:47.208
What? I gave Kynesha's friend
a ride home myself.

29:47.380 --> 29:49.621
- Just Kynesha, then.
- She's the one that called you.

29:49.840 --> 29:51.666
- So she's not completely stupid.
- Cleo-

29:51.841 --> 29:54.296
Get her in here now.
I want to talk to her.

29:54.468 --> 29:56.128
- Why don't we just-?
- Get her in here...

29:56.303 --> 29:58.628
- ... or I'll have the police talk to her.
- Cleo, I-

30:01.348 --> 30:04.302
- Excuse me. Are you Dr. Benton?
- Yeah.

30:04.476 --> 30:06.551
I'm Melissa Walker.
You found my daughter.

30:06.727 --> 30:09.728
She's in Radiology. We just wanted
to get an x-ray of her foot.

30:09.896 --> 30:11.390
- Oh, God!
- It's nothing serious.

30:11.564 --> 30:14.399
We just wanted to rule out a fracture.
She has three stitches.

30:14.566 --> 30:16.938
Did she fight you?
She's afraid of hospitals.

30:17.110 --> 30:18.901
Yeah.

30:19.945 --> 30:22.234
You know...

30:26.492 --> 30:28.863
I think it might be more
than just the needles.

30:29.035 --> 30:32.735
The leukapheresis requires a big one
in each arm for five hours.

30:33.497 --> 30:36.699
Taylor feels the only reason
you had her was to help Nicole.

30:38.751 --> 30:40.660
- We love both of our daughters.
- Of course.

30:40.836 --> 30:43.919
If you had a child dying of leukemia
and there was no bone-marrow match...

30:44.088 --> 30:47.291
...what would you do? We were planning
to have more children anyway, but...

30:47.466 --> 30:50.549
...I am tired of having to explain
this like we did something wrong.

30:50.760 --> 30:53.962
- I was just telling you Taylor feels-
- I know. She's my daughter.

30:54.137 --> 30:57.221
And I love her, okay? I love her.
Now, where is X-ray?

30:58.140 --> 31:00.097
- Mrs. Walker, I was just-
- Where is X-ray?

31:01.059 --> 31:04.427
- Down the main hall to the right.
- Thank you.

31:17.321 --> 31:19.360
- Hi.
- Hi.

31:21.991 --> 31:23.271
What's his name?

31:23.451 --> 31:25.692
Michael. Michael Alexander.

31:27.203 --> 31:29.409
Hey, Michael.

31:41.964 --> 31:44.205
It's okay.

32:36.546 --> 32:38.170
What did he say?

32:38.339 --> 32:39.797
I may go to trial.

32:39.965 --> 32:43.629
- Thought you were gonna settle.
- Yeah, so did I.

32:43.843 --> 32:47.128
Rachel called. She wants to come out
a day early for Christmas.

32:47.304 --> 32:50.719
Mark Greene? Dr. Burke.
Nice to meet you.

32:50.890 --> 32:53.131
- You too.
- And you are?

32:53.350 --> 32:54.974
Dr. Elizabeth Corday,
Dr. Greene's fiancée.

32:55.185 --> 32:56.976
- Oh, congratulations.
- Thank you.

32:57.144 --> 33:00.145
Sorry to keep you waiting. I met
some resistance in tumor board.

33:00.772 --> 33:02.017
Is that good or bad?

33:02.774 --> 33:07.269
The oncologists and radiation therapists
are having trouble embracing the future.

33:07.611 --> 33:08.939
Meaning?

33:09.445 --> 33:10.524
Come over here.

33:10.738 --> 33:14.651
They see a lesion like yours, they jump
to the conclusion it's inoperable.

33:14.866 --> 33:15.980
But it's not?

33:16.158 --> 33:18.565
Not in my hands.

33:19.453 --> 33:24.030
There's your tumor. Now, as you
were doing verbal tasks...

33:24.206 --> 33:26.910
...there was increased blood flow
to language centers...

33:27.083 --> 33:28.198
Those light up in orange.

33:28.376 --> 33:31.708
As you can see, while the tumor's
adjacent to Broca's...

33:31.878 --> 33:33.159
...it hasn't invaded yet.

33:34.172 --> 33:36.792
That's not what the neurosurgeon
in Chicago said.

33:37.007 --> 33:38.287
That's why you're here.

33:39.175 --> 33:40.966
So you'll operate?

33:41.135 --> 33:43.922
Yeah. We'll do an awake craniotomy.

33:44.346 --> 33:45.923
You'll be conscious and talking...

33:46.097 --> 33:48.766
...while I map out Broca's
and resect the tumor,

33:48.933 --> 33:50.391
but the real bonus is my ability...

33:50.559 --> 33:53.844
...to insert high-dosage chemotherapy
wafers into the tumor cavity...

33:54.020 --> 33:59.060
...and use the malignant cells themselves
to create a cancer vaccine.

33:59.274 --> 34:01.313
- Thank God for second opinions.
- Yeah.

34:01.484 --> 34:05.065
Those idiots on the tumor board
are satisfied with 12-month survival...

34:05.236 --> 34:07.608
...where most of the patients
on my protocol...

34:07.780 --> 34:12.108
...are disease-free
24 months and counting.

34:13.534 --> 34:17.150
So when can you fit him
into the schedule?

34:21.165 --> 34:22.742
How about December 31?

34:22.916 --> 34:26.498
You can ring in the new year
with a load off your mind.

34:27.543 --> 34:31.208
- Brain-surgeon humor.
- Right.

34:31.547 --> 34:32.827
You okay?

34:33.007 --> 34:36.339
Yeah, sure. It's good news.

34:36.551 --> 34:37.926
It's very good news.

34:43.223 --> 34:45.891
You came to the right place, Mark.

35:00.735 --> 35:05.028
Dr. Carter! Wake up, Dr. Carter.
Multivictim MVA coming in.

35:05.197 --> 35:07.023
Hell's Angel versus a minivan.

35:07.199 --> 35:09.570
- What?
- Motorcycle hit a minivan. Let's go.

35:09.742 --> 35:12.576
Fortyish-year-old male, closed head
trauma. Altered at the scene.

35:12.744 --> 35:13.823
No helmet?

35:13.995 --> 35:17.245
You kidding? This moron was driving
a hog in the middle of winter.

35:17.414 --> 35:19.407
- Lost the IV.
- Put another one in.

35:19.583 --> 35:21.990
Cut the Gap collection off of him,
get him on a monitor.

35:22.376 --> 35:24.997
- Scissors can't cut through this.
- Use wire cutters.

35:25.170 --> 35:26.878
Pupils are poorly reactive.

35:27.047 --> 35:29.371
Check this out.
This ain't his first crash.

35:29.590 --> 35:33.207
He's got brain fluid in the right ear.
Let's get him in line for a CT.

35:33.676 --> 35:34.839
That's a nasty scar.

35:35.011 --> 35:38.924
That probably explains this. Vicodin for
pain, Hyzaar for high blood pressure...

35:39.139 --> 35:40.763
- ...Lipitor for cholesterol.
- Yeah.

35:40.932 --> 35:43.138
I've heard Hell's Angels
are on a pretty good diet.

35:43.308 --> 35:46.095
Carter, Weaver needs you. It wasn't
a minivan, it was a "van" van.

35:46.311 --> 35:49.181
About a dozen kids got hurt
on the way to a Christmas pageant.

35:49.355 --> 35:50.979
Okay, I'll be right there.

35:51.439 --> 35:54.226
Yeah, but that's why I wanted
to handle this thing in person.

35:54.400 --> 35:58.527
- Peter, she's not your responsibility.
- I know that, Cleo, but...

35:58.695 --> 36:02.608
Look, I don't want her bothering Jackie.
I just, I don't want-

36:02.781 --> 36:04.572
Kynesha?

36:10.912 --> 36:16.451
I'm sorry, Dr. Finch. I didn't take
your car, but I think Tiny did.

36:16.625 --> 36:19.578
Your keys was missing,
so I lied to you.

36:19.794 --> 36:21.702
I was afraid you was
gonna kick me out!

36:22.921 --> 36:26.206
I don't have nowhere to go.

36:27.424 --> 36:30.709
Okay. Hank, can you press
against my hand?

36:32.136 --> 36:34.805
Is my mom all right?

36:34.972 --> 36:36.928
Abby, have you seen this guy's mom?

36:37.098 --> 36:39.968
- Weaver has her. Seat-belt injury.
- CBC and UA here.

36:40.142 --> 36:42.181
- Dr. Carter!
- What do you got? Be right back.

36:42.352 --> 36:44.640
Nine-year-old MVA. Head lac
from broken glass. No LOC.

36:44.812 --> 36:48.346
150 of saline in the field.
Open tib-fib fracture on the right.

36:48.523 --> 36:51.014
- Hi, sweetheart. What's your name?
- Elise.

36:51.192 --> 36:54.192
- Elise? Does your neck hurt?
- Yes.

36:54.402 --> 36:56.525
Okay, let's go to Trauma 2.

36:56.863 --> 36:59.318
- What kind of costume is that?
- Milkmaid.

36:59.490 --> 37:01.446
- What?
- Milkmaid.

37:01.658 --> 37:03.899
You mean like "The Twelve
Days of Christmas. "

37:04.076 --> 37:07.658
- We're missing our play.
- What is this guy still doing in here?

37:07.829 --> 37:10.498
Oh, CT just called for him.
They had a code on the table.

37:10.664 --> 37:13.830
Take her to Curtain 3 until
this room is cleared out. Come on.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.867
CBC, C-spine, right tib-fib, 5 of
MS for the pain, a gram of Ancef.

37:18.087 --> 37:21.455
Don't worry, Elise! Everything is
gonna be fine, sweetheart!

37:24.550 --> 37:27.170
Oh, God!

37:40.687 --> 37:42.762
Hold still. You have to let me look.

37:42.938 --> 37:44.017
It hurts!

37:44.189 --> 37:46.146
I know.

37:46.691 --> 37:48.600
- What do you got?
- Three more from the van.

37:48.776 --> 37:50.685
This is Eddie. Cracked his collarbone.

37:50.861 --> 37:52.355
- Right with you. Yeah?
- Hyper number one.

37:52.529 --> 37:55.197
Seat-belted in, no obvious trauma,
complains of belly pain.

37:55.364 --> 37:57.024
Give these to Dori in Curtain 3.

37:57.199 --> 37:59.155
Take him to Curtain 2.
Give me vitals.

37:59.325 --> 38:02.610
I already did. BP, 110 over 70.
Pulse, 90.

38:02.786 --> 38:06.617
- What?
- BP, 110 over 70. Pulse, 90.

38:06.789 --> 38:08.034
- Slow down.
- Sorry.

38:08.207 --> 38:09.238
- You all right?
- Yeah.

38:09.416 --> 38:11.289
Kids in Exam 4
need their necks cleared.

38:21.717 --> 38:23.875
Come on. Come on!

38:50.738 --> 38:52.196
Does it need stitches?

38:52.364 --> 38:55.982
I don't know. I have to get an x-ray,
make sure there's no glass in there.

38:56.159 --> 38:57.818
Is my mom coming?

38:57.993 --> 38:59.571
- I need to talk to you.
- Just a sec.

38:59.745 --> 39:01.737
- Now.
- Is my mom coming?

39:01.913 --> 39:04.913
Yeah, somebody called her.
Here, can you hold this for me?

39:05.082 --> 39:07.619
And press down but don't make it hurt.

39:07.792 --> 39:10.199
- Lindsay, can you...?
- Yeah.

39:13.171 --> 39:14.202
What?

39:14.381 --> 39:16.503
- I took two Vicodin.
- What?

39:16.674 --> 39:20.256
I took two Vicodin. Then I panicked
and ran in the bathroom...

39:20.427 --> 39:24.258
- ...stuck my fingers down my throat.
- You vomited them up?

39:24.596 --> 39:26.304
- How'd you sign them out?
- I didn't.

39:26.473 --> 39:29.141
I didn't. This biker comes in
with a full bottle.

39:29.308 --> 39:30.767
Well, good. You didn't actually-

39:30.934 --> 39:34.219
I don't even know what I was thinking.
I didn't plan on taking anything...

39:34.395 --> 39:37.182
- ...I just saw them, and I-
- It's okay.

39:39.274 --> 39:41.396
Are you gonna tell Weaver?

39:42.943 --> 39:46.062
- I can't.
- I think you have to.

39:46.237 --> 39:48.064
Well, then, I'm done.

39:48.406 --> 39:51.939
I mean, best-case scenario,
I'm back in Atlanta.

39:52.409 --> 39:54.650
I mean, does it count?
It was never in my system.

39:54.827 --> 39:58.195
All right, I'm off in 10 minutes.
Let's go to a meeting.

39:59.122 --> 40:01.529
- I just started.
- Well, you're sick. You threw up.

40:01.707 --> 40:04.458
- Tell Weaver you have to go home.
- You have to be on death's door-

40:04.626 --> 40:06.997
Go convince her.

40:17.177 --> 40:22.252
- So you'll tell Rachel and Jen now?
- Yeah, I'll fly out there Friday.

40:22.431 --> 40:23.972
You like it?

40:24.140 --> 40:26.809
- What?
- The pizza.

40:27.893 --> 40:32.803
It tastes just like it did when I was 8.
It's weird how that works.

40:33.731 --> 40:37.562
I wouldn't have been able to remember
it if I hadn't tasted it again.

40:37.734 --> 40:39.476
It's good, though.

40:39.652 --> 40:41.145
You lived in New York?

40:41.320 --> 40:43.644
A couple of months.

40:43.863 --> 40:47.397
Dad taught me how to skate backwards
on this rink.

40:47.699 --> 40:49.987
You never told me that.

40:50.159 --> 40:52.068
You never came
to see me play hockey.

40:52.244 --> 40:54.320
No, that you lived here, I mean.

40:54.496 --> 40:59.157
Well, I can't tell you everything.
I have to keep you interested.

41:01.001 --> 41:03.669
You didn't sign up for this, though.

41:04.086 --> 41:06.078
It's called marriage, Mark.

41:06.255 --> 41:08.163
We're not married yet.

41:08.339 --> 41:10.628
You really believe that?

41:11.884 --> 41:14.089
Didn't think so.

41:15.845 --> 41:17.552
Hey, check it out.

41:17.763 --> 41:22.507
There's a kid in another one of those
hats. They must be on sale someplace.

41:23.184 --> 41:25.425
Guess it blows your theory.

41:25.602 --> 41:27.345
Yeah.

41:29.772 --> 41:32.013
It was a good day.

41:39.029 --> 41:41.021
- Hey, Malucci!
- I'll catch you later, chief.

41:41.197 --> 41:43.319
Carter went home sick.
I need you to stay.

41:43.490 --> 41:45.945
- Come on, chief!
- It's part of being a resident.

41:46.159 --> 41:48.696
He's just tired. He stayed up
all day with Chen.

41:48.911 --> 41:53.038
All the more reason for you to lend a
hand. I just need you for four more hours.

41:53.581 --> 41:54.861
Damn these hiccups.

41:55.040 --> 41:58.871
Okay, I got an 85-year-old with
abdominal pain, headache and dizziness.

41:59.043 --> 42:01.830
- This sucks, man!
- Yeah, it does.

42:07.800 --> 42:12.461
I saw the patient in 7.
She agreed to a voluntary admission...

42:12.637 --> 42:14.593
Thank you.

42:14.763 --> 42:16.802
Hiccups.

42:18.099 --> 42:20.221
- Does it work?
- I don't know. I'm desperate.

42:20.392 --> 42:22.550
Now I'm listening to Randi.

42:22.936 --> 42:26.304
- Did you like it?
- Yes.

42:26.772 --> 42:30.769
First edition.
Must have been expensive.

42:30.942 --> 42:34.606
What's the point of working like a maniac
if you can't spend money on friends?

42:35.946 --> 42:38.021
Friends.

42:39.490 --> 42:41.945
I don't think we're in
the same place on this.

42:42.117 --> 42:44.903
- On what, Christmas?
- No. Us.

42:46.245 --> 42:48.616
I don't need any more friends.

42:50.456 --> 42:53.540
Okay. Okay.

42:53.959 --> 42:55.121
I understand.

42:55.543 --> 42:56.706
Do you?

42:56.919 --> 42:58.793
No. No. I like you and respect you,

42:58.963 --> 43:00.705
and I thought we were really hitting it off.

43:00.922 --> 43:04.421
That's the problem.
You're straight, and I'm not.

43:04.633 --> 43:06.783
And I've done this before.

43:06.818 --> 43:08.882
It didn't work out,
and I am not gonna do it again.

43:09.053 --> 43:11.092
But I'm not asking for that from you.

43:11.263 --> 43:15.046
We're comfortable together, we have
a lot in common, we have fun together-

43:24.023 --> 43:26.774
That's why I can't be
your friend, Kerry.

43:34.739 --> 43:36.067
You want me to get that?

43:36.240 --> 43:38.446
Yeah, could you?

43:42.036 --> 43:44.028
Room 914.

43:44.204 --> 43:47.821
Yes. Hold on.

43:48.207 --> 43:50.283
It's your mother.

43:52.293 --> 43:55.377
She's sleeping right now.
Can I take a message?

43:55.546 --> 43:59.377
I don't know. Okay.

44:00.633 --> 44:01.664
She wants you to call her.

44:01.842 --> 44:03.668
Put a "do not disturb" on the phone.

44:03.927 --> 44:06.678
Sure. Thank you.
