WEBVTT

01:12.594 --> 01:15.858
The Second World War
is coming to an end.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.688
Finland and the Soviet Union

01:19.731 --> 01:22.517
have signed
the Moscow Armistice

01:22.560 --> 01:26.260
which decrees that Finland
must disarm the Nazis

01:26.303 --> 01:28.610
and drive them out of Lapland.

01:32.135 --> 01:35.486
The Nazis adopt
a scorched earth tactic

01:35.530 --> 01:39.011
and destroy
all roads, bridges,

01:39.055 --> 01:42.276
villages and towns
in their path.

01:46.410 --> 01:49.239
Deep in the wilderness
of Lapland,

01:49.283 --> 01:54.375
there is a man who has decided
to leave the war behind him.

01:55.854 --> 01:56.986
For good.

02:57.655 --> 03:00.397
Yeah!

12:49.333 --> 12:51.248
He's riding
to his death anyway.

14:37.093 --> 14:38.268
Get off the horse!

14:44.100 --> 14:46.363
Where do you think
you're going, old man?

14:46.407 --> 14:49.410
There's nothing down there.
We made sure of that.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.154
What do you got there?

15:08.777 --> 15:10.866
This old fucker
is a gold miner.

15:19.222 --> 15:20.745
You got gold in those bags?

15:27.274 --> 15:29.319
-Take a look at this!

15:32.888 --> 15:34.281
-We're rich, boys!

15:38.546 --> 15:40.504
-You're dead!

15:53.082 --> 15:55.476
-Get down on your knees.

15:55.519 --> 15:57.173
These bags
are full of gold!

16:02.178 --> 16:04.224
Get down on your knees,
grandpa!

16:06.617 --> 16:07.836
Huh?

16:10.926 --> 16:13.624
-Shoot the fucker!

16:13.668 --> 16:15.713
-Fuck him up!

16:22.764 --> 16:23.765
Thanks for the gold!

16:26.246 --> 16:28.074
We've got gold!

16:29.292 --> 16:30.293
Thank you, old fuck...

23:29.408 --> 23:30.409
Wait.

24:31.470 --> 24:32.949
-Now.

24:45.092 --> 24:46.485
Fire!

25:00.586 --> 25:01.761
Cease fire!

26:32.852 --> 26:33.853
Huh?

26:52.045 --> 26:53.089
You...

26:57.964 --> 26:59.095
and you.

27:00.357 --> 27:02.229
On the sides of the road, now!

27:34.696 --> 27:36.567
How many mines
did we bury here?

27:38.004 --> 27:39.092
All of them.

27:43.270 --> 27:45.664
Pick two of our female friends
and bring them to me.

27:47.578 --> 27:48.579
And some rope.

28:02.724 --> 28:03.856
You...

28:05.509 --> 28:06.510
and you.

28:13.996 --> 28:14.954
Pick me.

29:22.848 --> 29:24.588
Thank you, General.

29:24.632 --> 29:26.373
I will pass on
the information.

29:27.243 --> 29:28.244
Over and out.

29:31.682 --> 29:35.251
The General,
he has given us orders.

29:35.295 --> 29:40.604
Turn back and head to Norway
from Finland immediately.

29:40.648 --> 29:43.129
Did you tell him he just
killed seven of our men?

29:43.172 --> 29:44.173
I did.

29:45.087 --> 29:46.088
And?

29:47.742 --> 29:49.091
He thinks we were lucky.

29:51.224 --> 29:52.442
Fucking lucky.

29:56.751 --> 29:59.580
The dog tags belong
to a man named Aatami Korpi.

30:01.234 --> 30:05.629
He was a Finnish commando.
The most feared in his unit.

30:08.241 --> 30:11.113
The General said, and I quote,

30:12.245 --> 30:13.550
"He's one mean motherfucker

30:13.594 --> 30:15.552
"that you do not
want to mess with."

30:19.469 --> 30:22.037
He fought in the Winter War.

30:22.081 --> 30:25.214
Lost his home and his family
to the Russians.

30:27.260 --> 30:30.393
He became a ruthless,
vengeful soldier

30:30.437 --> 30:32.004
who took orders from no one.

30:33.875 --> 30:38.097
The Finns, they gave up trying
to discipline or control him.

30:38.140 --> 30:39.620
They just sent him out,

30:39.663 --> 30:43.189
alone into the wilderness
to hunt Russian patrols.

30:44.799 --> 30:46.975
He became a one-man
death squad.

30:53.242 --> 30:55.723
The reports
are unconfirmed,

30:55.766 --> 30:59.988
but it looks like
he has over 300 Russian kills.

31:01.729 --> 31:04.863
The Russians,
they gave him a name.

31:07.169 --> 31:08.736
They call him Koschei,

31:10.433 --> 31:11.652
"The Immortal."

31:13.828 --> 31:14.873
Immortal?

31:42.770 --> 31:44.337
The road is clear, sir.

31:47.470 --> 31:49.516
We are going to follow
our orders, right?

31:52.214 --> 31:53.650
We are turning back?

31:56.262 --> 31:57.263
No.

31:59.395 --> 32:00.657
We are not turning back.

32:03.704 --> 32:06.054
We are losing the war. We are.

32:07.621 --> 32:10.667
In a few months,
this all will be over for us.

32:13.018 --> 32:15.629
When we get back,
they will...

32:16.673 --> 32:17.892
hang us all.

32:23.898 --> 32:25.682
That gold is our way out.

34:44.256 --> 34:45.996
-Eyes open!

34:48.738 --> 34:50.044
Check the sides.

34:54.527 --> 34:55.789
Nothing here.

35:22.598 --> 35:24.339
Oh, wait,
I see movement.

35:25.297 --> 35:26.341
Don't fall behind!

35:54.152 --> 35:55.414
Hey, hey... Hey!

36:40.546 --> 36:41.938
Gasoline!

36:50.382 --> 36:51.818
The dogs lost the scent!

36:59.260 --> 37:00.435
What's happening?

37:02.394 --> 37:03.482
There's gasoline on the road.

37:05.135 --> 37:06.180
They are useless!

37:06.224 --> 37:08.487
-Calm down, boy!

37:16.495 --> 37:17.452
Hey!

37:25.068 --> 37:26.156
Release the dog.

37:27.419 --> 37:28.681
Release the dog!

37:29.638 --> 37:30.900
Go on, boy!

37:40.040 --> 37:41.781
-Finish him.

38:11.550 --> 38:14.292
Immortal or not,
a man needs air.

38:57.509 --> 38:59.380
Now, get me the gold.

39:45.818 --> 39:48.473
Go after him! Now!

41:04.287 --> 41:06.376
One more meter
and I'll have you shot!

41:14.907 --> 41:16.865
Desertion is punishable
by death.

41:39.671 --> 41:40.715
Fuck this.

42:43.473 --> 42:45.171
Hey!

42:45.998 --> 42:47.739
Come here.

42:51.830 --> 42:52.831
Find me a boat.

48:01.530 --> 48:02.880
Any last words?

48:08.973 --> 48:10.104
I didn't think so.

49:30.358 --> 49:31.490
For your troubles.

49:53.947 --> 49:55.079
Put the hat back on.

53:22.938 --> 53:24.984
This son of a bitch
is still alive.

53:28.857 --> 53:29.989
Shoot the man

53:30.816 --> 53:32.078
and shoot the dog, too.

53:50.052 --> 53:51.140
And the dog!

53:55.754 --> 53:57.234
Shoot the fucking dog!

54:07.548 --> 54:08.549
Muller?

54:32.443 --> 54:33.487
Muller?

58:21.802 --> 58:22.934
The plane is ready.

58:23.978 --> 58:26.111
What about the rest
of our squad?

58:26.154 --> 58:28.461
They don't need us
to get to Norway.

58:28.505 --> 58:30.245
The boys have
a crateful of booze

58:30.289 --> 58:32.509
and a truckful of bitches.

58:32.552 --> 58:34.685
I'm sure they'll
figure something out.

58:35.424 --> 58:36.730
I would.

58:48.437 --> 58:50.831
The road is blocked.
Come and take a look at this.

58:53.747 --> 58:55.488
What's going on?

58:55.532 --> 58:57.185
There's something in the road.

59:35.136 --> 59:36.311
Is this the plane?

59:39.445 --> 59:40.881
No, idiot.

59:43.492 --> 59:44.755
This is something else.

01:00:13.697 --> 01:00:15.263
The pilot has been hanged.

01:00:24.272 --> 01:00:27.362
-That's my rope.
-What?

01:00:27.406 --> 01:00:29.669
That's the rope I used
to hang Korpi with.

01:00:40.071 --> 01:00:42.073
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

01:00:44.292 --> 01:00:46.077
I recognize it, I swear.

01:00:47.469 --> 01:00:48.470
What's the order?

01:00:49.167 --> 01:00:51.648
Everybody move!

01:00:51.691 --> 01:00:53.954
Start the engines.
Come on, let's go.

01:01:03.355 --> 01:01:04.661
Let's go, go!

01:01:09.187 --> 01:01:10.536
Well?

01:01:14.322 --> 01:01:15.323
He's back.

01:01:18.805 --> 01:01:20.328
He's hanging from
a rope somewhere.

01:01:20.372 --> 01:01:21.460
He's dead.

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.728
-What's so fucking funny?
-Nothing.

01:01:28.772 --> 01:01:30.687
What the fuck
are you smiling for, then?

01:01:38.477 --> 01:01:42.394
Do you assholes really think
you have succeeded

01:01:42.437 --> 01:01:45.049
where hundreds of Russians
have died trying?

01:01:49.749 --> 01:01:51.055
We all know the story.

01:01:55.189 --> 01:01:57.931
You'll see what happens when
you take everything from him.

01:02:01.805 --> 01:02:02.893
He won't give up.

01:02:05.069 --> 01:02:06.418
He'll just keep coming back.

01:02:07.985 --> 01:02:09.769
Do you really believe
that he's immortal?

01:02:10.988 --> 01:02:12.076
No.

01:02:14.252 --> 01:02:15.775
He just refuses to die.

01:02:19.648 --> 01:02:22.477
We have a word for that
in Finland,

01:02:22.521 --> 01:02:24.044
but it's impossible
to translate.

01:02:25.306 --> 01:02:26.307
You see,

01:02:27.526 --> 01:02:29.658
this is not about
who's the strongest.

01:02:31.269 --> 01:02:32.879
This is about not giving up.

01:02:34.576 --> 01:02:35.708
And he won't.

01:02:38.015 --> 01:02:39.059
Ever.

01:02:44.935 --> 01:02:46.850
No matter what
you bitches are trying.

01:02:48.547 --> 01:02:49.983
You will make him stronger.

01:02:51.942 --> 01:02:53.073
So...

01:02:54.727 --> 01:02:56.337
what is so fucking funny,

01:02:57.817 --> 01:02:59.166
is that you...

01:03:01.995 --> 01:03:03.344
your boyfriend...

01:03:05.433 --> 01:03:08.741
and everything that is left
of your sorry-assed company...

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:12.092
are already dead.

01:03:18.403 --> 01:03:20.100
-What?

01:03:37.335 --> 01:03:38.423
Was that one of ours?

01:05:11.429 --> 01:05:12.473
Was that Jens?

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:43.287
We almost ran
into the bitches.

01:05:43.330 --> 01:05:45.419
Can somebody tell me
what the fuck is going on?

01:05:51.295 --> 01:05:52.992
Nothing. It's all good, sir.

01:06:43.738 --> 01:06:45.392
Sir.

01:06:45.436 --> 01:06:46.393
They're all dead.

01:06:49.309 --> 01:06:51.181
We are almost there.
Step on it!

01:07:13.594 --> 01:07:14.595
Wolf.

01:07:15.988 --> 01:07:17.685
Go out there and kill him.

01:07:26.259 --> 01:07:27.347
One,

01:07:27.956 --> 01:07:29.001
two,

01:07:29.567 --> 01:07:30.916
three!

01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:23.751
Keep going!

01:08:27.146 --> 01:08:28.104
Keep going.

01:08:49.342 --> 01:08:51.170
Please... Please...

01:09:09.449 --> 01:09:11.321
That's him, that's Koschei.

01:12:29.823 --> 01:12:30.911
Do you see him?

01:12:33.958 --> 01:12:36.308
Yep.
He's still down there.

01:13:07.295 --> 01:13:09.950
It's bad. It's bad, I need...

01:13:09.994 --> 01:13:12.213
If you're not dead,
you fly this fucking plane!

01:13:26.489 --> 01:13:27.751
Did you hear that?

01:13:27.794 --> 01:13:29.796
It's nothing.
Just an old plane.

01:14:20.891 --> 01:14:22.762
We might have a problem.

01:17:04.663 --> 01:17:06.752
Die. Fucker!

01:17:06.796 --> 01:17:07.840
Why

01:17:07.884 --> 01:17:09.015
won't you

01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:11.061
die?

01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:11.034
Fuck you!

01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:35.482
To your positions.

01:21:11.736 --> 01:21:12.650
Hello.

01:21:15.653 --> 01:21:17.742
Where did you get that tank?

01:21:18.786 --> 01:21:20.049
From the Nazis.

01:21:21.485 --> 01:21:22.878
Where are the Nazis?

01:21:24.618 --> 01:21:27.708
- Except this asshole,
they're all in hell.

01:21:28.492 --> 01:21:29.797
Hell?

01:21:33.976 --> 01:21:35.716
Were there others?

01:21:37.457 --> 01:21:39.198
Everyone else is dead.

01:24:57.396 --> 01:24:58.702
Bills.

01:24:58.832 --> 01:25:01.313
Big ones, please.

01:25:05.622 --> 01:25:08.538
Won't be so damn heavy to carry.
