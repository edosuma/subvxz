00:32.241 --> 00:34.411
How you doing, mate?
Treating you good, are they?

00:37.706 --> 00:39.416
Spoke to Dr. Hunter.

00:40.459 --> 00:42.586
He thinks you're making some progress.

00:42.753 --> 00:44.838
Before you know it, we'll be back
on the road with the band.

00:47.591 --> 00:50.469
Of course, we'll have to find
replacements for Alan and Steve.

00:51.136 --> 00:52.846
God bless the poor bastards.

00:53.639 --> 00:55.349
But all in good time, right?

00:56.225 --> 00:58.185
Brought you something.

00:58.268 --> 01:00.771
Not the esoteric stuff you usually go for.

01:10.239 --> 01:11.823
Beats staring out the window, right?

01:13.242 --> 01:14.368
I mean, you...

01:17.287 --> 01:18.288
Johnny.

01:26.838 --> 01:28.048
Johnny, what are you doing?

01:28.131 --> 01:29.633
You swore you were gonna stop.

01:29.716 --> 01:31.343
No more magic, right?

01:39.935 --> 01:42.521
No more magic!

01:44.481 --> 01:45.899
I have to.

01:46.817 --> 01:51.196
I... I have to. I have to.

01:52.990 --> 01:54.992
I can't let it happen again, Chas.

01:56.243 --> 01:59.162
I can't let it happen again.

02:00.414 --> 02:02.499
I can't let it happen again!

02:02.582 --> 02:03.625
Some help in here!

02:06.253 --> 02:08.738
I can't let it happen...

02:10.966 --> 02:13.260
Hey, easy on him. Jesus!

02:25.605 --> 02:28.108
I can't... Can't...

02:28.233 --> 02:30.944
Let it happen...

02:55.344 --> 02:58.096
<i>You had an affair and now she's pregnant?</i>

03:00.599 --> 03:02.876
<i>That's great news. I'm so happy for you.</i>

03:06.646 --> 03:09.491
<i>Queen of Angels.</i>

03:17.199 --> 03:18.992
Last time I ever drink like that.

03:23.590 --> 03:25.040
Yeah, right.

03:25.540 --> 03:27.250
Tell us another one, John.

03:40.845 --> 03:43.600
Jesus! I must be still dreaming.

03:51.135 --> 03:53.176
Nope, definitely not dreaming.

03:56.613 --> 03:58.156
What are you?

03:58.240 --> 04:00.033
We're you, Johnny.

04:00.325 --> 04:01.785
Like hell you are.

04:05.831 --> 04:08.875
"Materialized psychisms," Jung called us.

04:09.251 --> 04:12.379
Projections from the unconscious.

04:12.963 --> 04:15.173
Your own inner demons

04:15.257 --> 04:17.591
given physical form.

04:17.676 --> 04:19.094
Oh, that's not good.

04:19.177 --> 04:22.681
And the only way I'm going to
stop you nasty little buggers

04:22.764 --> 04:25.392
is to take you back!

04:54.045 --> 04:56.673
Something opened a door between
my conscious and unconscious mind

04:56.756 --> 05:00.193
and let them out.
That's never happened before.

05:02.012 --> 05:03.930
Christ. We don't want any!

05:04.097 --> 05:05.640
Open the bloody door, John.

05:06.224 --> 05:07.225
Chas?

05:14.858 --> 05:16.443
Maybe this isn't a good time.

05:17.319 --> 05:19.362
It's never a good time, mate.

05:24.826 --> 05:26.495
You look like shit.

05:26.578 --> 05:28.038
Oh, thanks, mate.

05:28.121 --> 05:30.040
And how have you been this past, what is it?

05:30.123 --> 05:31.583
Nine years, 10?

05:32.000 --> 05:35.086
Since you spewed up all over
Renee's aunty at the wedding.

05:35.795 --> 05:37.547
She took it well, I thought.

05:37.631 --> 05:39.466
The aunty, not Renee.

05:39.674 --> 05:43.053
So, you two lived happily ever after, eh?

05:46.306 --> 05:47.849
Not exactly.

05:47.933 --> 05:49.476
We've been separated for seven months.

05:50.769 --> 05:52.604
Who'd you shag then, knob-head?

05:53.104 --> 05:54.356
Nobody.

05:54.773 --> 05:56.483
If it was as simple as that,

05:56.858 --> 05:59.069
- maybe we could've...
- Could've what?

06:00.746 --> 06:02.321
I don't know.

06:02.405 --> 06:04.366
We were happy, we really were.

06:04.950 --> 06:06.535
In the past few years,

06:07.077 --> 06:09.120
I've been in a kind of dark place.

06:10.121 --> 06:11.665
Pushing Renee away.

06:12.040 --> 06:13.291
Drinking myself sick.

06:13.792 --> 06:14.918
I, uh...

06:17.754 --> 06:19.881
You... What?

06:20.674 --> 06:22.384
I thought I was past it, John.

06:23.301 --> 06:24.653
After all this time.

06:27.556 --> 06:28.807
I thought I was past it.

06:29.391 --> 06:31.059
Why are you here, Chas?

06:31.351 --> 06:34.396
It's not for marital advice, and it's not
'cause you've missed me all these years,

06:34.479 --> 06:35.522
that's for sure.

06:35.605 --> 06:36.815
Maybe I have.

06:37.691 --> 06:39.317
You were my best mate, John.

06:40.026 --> 06:41.111
Since we were 10 years old.

06:42.487 --> 06:43.905
Why are you here?

06:43.989 --> 06:48.034
Since Renee kicked me out,
it's like my whole world's gone dark.

06:49.995 --> 06:52.664
Only decent thing I've been able
to hold on to is my little girl.

06:53.039 --> 06:54.542
You have a kid?

06:54.649 --> 06:56.376
She's eight years old.

06:56.459 --> 06:58.378
I sent you a bloody announcement
when she was born.

06:59.170 --> 07:00.755
Must have missed that one.

07:01.089 --> 07:02.882
Trish is...

07:02.966 --> 07:04.926
She's the only light in my world.

07:06.261 --> 07:08.930
The only hope... And, uh...

07:10.056 --> 07:11.057
What?

07:17.522 --> 07:19.357
She's in a coma.

07:19.441 --> 07:22.319
Doctors haven't a clue
what caused it or how to cure it.

07:22.986 --> 07:26.823
But I've spent enough time around you
to smell the stink of dark magic.

07:27.949 --> 07:31.911
It's convenient to pin our troubles
on some devil lurking in the shadows, Chas.

07:31.995 --> 07:34.914
But sometimes, shitty things happen

07:34.998 --> 07:38.251
because that's just the way the world is.

07:38.418 --> 07:39.919
Just come have a look at her.

07:40.420 --> 07:41.630
That's all I'm asking.

07:47.469 --> 07:51.681
Saving kids isn't something I'm very
good at, as you know better than most.

07:51.806 --> 07:54.893
But it's different this time, John.
It's my daughter.

07:54.976 --> 07:56.102
My daughter.

07:56.394 --> 07:58.438
All the more reason not to bring me into it.

08:00.649 --> 08:01.900
No, no.

08:01.983 --> 08:03.818
- I won't have him here.
- He can help.

08:04.402 --> 08:05.445
Help?

08:05.528 --> 08:08.365
He's a disease that infects
everything around him.

08:09.366 --> 08:11.826
And I won't have him infecting my girl.

08:12.285 --> 08:13.995
Chuffed to see you too, Renee.

08:14.746 --> 08:15.747
How long do you need?

08:15.830 --> 08:16.873
Five minutes.

08:17.415 --> 08:18.416
Alone.

08:19.125 --> 08:20.794
Five minutes, Renee.

08:21.002 --> 08:24.005
These bloody doctors
can't do anything, maybe he can.

08:24.297 --> 08:25.590
Five minutes.

08:37.894 --> 08:39.688
Not a second more.

09:10.635 --> 09:11.678
Hello, Trish.

09:12.887 --> 09:13.930
I'm John.

09:14.472 --> 09:16.141
Mind if I have a look at your aura?

09:24.274 --> 09:25.275
Tainted...

09:26.234 --> 09:27.318
By what?

09:28.445 --> 09:30.029
Let's have a look inside.

09:32.532 --> 09:34.367
Jeez! Bloody hell!

09:53.219 --> 09:56.014
Chas, Renee, I'm gonna need
a little more than five minutes.

09:56.264 --> 09:58.433
Why? What are you up to, John?

09:58.725 --> 10:00.393
I'm calling in a specialist.

10:00.727 --> 10:02.729
John, John!

10:03.271 --> 10:04.272
John!

10:40.600 --> 10:43.061
Ugh, your timing sucks, Johnny.

10:43.770 --> 10:46.731
I was right in the middle of a threesome
with a dryad and a sylph.

10:47.232 --> 10:50.527
Both of whom, I might add,
are better in the sack than you ever were.

10:50.610 --> 10:54.105
Hey, you were nothing to write
home to my mum about either, love.

10:54.802 --> 10:56.616
We both know that's not true.

10:57.033 --> 10:59.410
Now what do you want
from the Nightmare Nurse?

11:03.289 --> 11:06.626
Well, I did swear an oath
to preserve life, do no harm,

11:06.709 --> 11:08.378
and all that other crap.

11:13.466 --> 11:14.634
So, what do you think?

11:14.717 --> 11:16.719
I think you should shut up
and let me do my job.

11:17.053 --> 11:18.429
It's possession, right?

11:18.513 --> 11:20.598
What part of shut up don't you understand?

11:24.435 --> 11:27.939
It's not possession because
there's nothing here to possess.

11:28.022 --> 11:29.023
What?

11:29.107 --> 11:32.986
Her physical form is here
but her essence, her soul...

11:34.028 --> 11:35.071
It's gone.

11:35.154 --> 11:37.282
Well, someone was there a minute ago.

11:37.657 --> 11:39.200
Let's find out who.

11:54.799 --> 11:56.050
Help me!

11:56.134 --> 11:57.969
Trish, Trish, where are you?

11:58.303 --> 12:00.930
In a... In a cage, I think.

12:01.014 --> 12:02.223
It's hard to see.

12:02.765 --> 12:04.392
And it's so cold.

12:04.475 --> 12:05.602
Are you alone?

12:05.685 --> 12:06.936
All alone.

12:07.353 --> 12:09.397
Except when he comes.

12:09.480 --> 12:11.441
Who, Trish? Who comes?

12:12.817 --> 12:14.235
The nasty man.

12:14.319 --> 12:15.445
Does he have a name?

12:16.654 --> 12:18.448
Trish, does he have a name?

12:23.870 --> 12:26.497
I have many names.

12:27.624 --> 12:30.126
Be careful to choose the right one.

12:30.627 --> 12:33.087
Well, then tell me what the name is.

12:33.171 --> 12:34.297
Guess.

12:34.380 --> 12:36.390
This isn't a bloody game.

12:37.275 --> 12:39.005
It is to me.

12:39.093 --> 12:40.637
What do you want with the girl?

12:41.220 --> 12:44.307
Ooh, so many questions

12:44.390 --> 12:47.310
buzzing in your little gnat brain.

12:47.727 --> 12:51.648
But if you want answers, John Constantine,

12:52.357 --> 12:55.360
you'll have to come by for a visit.

12:55.818 --> 12:58.404
Come by? Come by where?

13:04.327 --> 13:06.996
John! John, open the damn door!

13:09.040 --> 13:11.709
Asa, are you okay?

13:14.921 --> 13:17.215
Give me a second to put my dress on.

13:23.054 --> 13:24.555
Son of a bitch!

13:24.639 --> 13:26.933
If I was human, I'd be toast now.

13:37.026 --> 13:39.779
But I'll get the paperwork written up
as soon as I can.

13:46.327 --> 13:48.246
What the hell, John? Who's she?

13:48.454 --> 13:51.624
A private nurse I've hired
to watch over Trish while I'm away.

13:51.833 --> 13:52.875
Away?

13:53.292 --> 13:54.419
Well, where are you going?

13:54.919 --> 13:56.671
Los Angeles, apparently.

14:03.761 --> 14:05.596
<i>I'll never leave you, I swear.</i>

14:06.764 --> 14:08.632
<i>Set a meeting for Tuesday.</i>

14:18.151 --> 14:22.113
That's the same dream I had before
all the psychisms came crawling out.

14:22.655 --> 14:24.282
Someone's messing with my head.

14:24.490 --> 14:26.576
Maybe it's early-onset dementia.

14:27.243 --> 14:28.911
I should be so lucky.

14:29.495 --> 14:32.081
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
as we prepare for landing,</i>

14:32.165 --> 14:34.792
<i>please be certain your seat belts
are securely fastened.</i>

14:35.334 --> 14:36.335
No problem.

14:41.424 --> 14:42.467
Beautiful, isn't it?

14:42.550 --> 14:44.927
We're not on a sightseeing tour, knob-head.

14:45.011 --> 14:48.306
I don't know how I let you
talk me into taking you along.

14:48.389 --> 14:50.058
It's my natural charm.

14:50.141 --> 14:51.392
You can't resist it.

14:52.643 --> 14:54.145
She's my kid, John.

14:54.896 --> 14:56.439
I have to be part of this.

14:57.690 --> 14:59.942
Besides, you need a driver.

15:00.151 --> 15:01.819
I can drive myself.

15:02.111 --> 15:03.112
Ha! Come off it.

15:03.196 --> 15:06.456
Five minutes behind the wheel and
you'll be wrapped around a palm tree.

15:07.950 --> 15:10.745
Oh, good thing I can depend
on your nerves of steel.

15:13.664 --> 15:18.211
Listen, we're messing with deep,
dark magic here, Chas.

15:18.461 --> 15:19.879
Deeper than Newcastle?

15:24.592 --> 15:26.344
Can't change the past, Chas.

15:26.803 --> 15:29.680
No. But you can change this.

15:38.940 --> 15:42.443
- Even if we can save Trish...
- We will.

15:43.653 --> 15:45.530
You will.

15:53.663 --> 15:55.998
If there's one thing
I've learned over the years,

15:56.582 --> 15:58.543
it's that there are no happy endings.

15:59.001 --> 16:00.378
There never are.

16:02.213 --> 16:04.132
There's always a price to pay.

16:05.341 --> 16:08.386
No price is too high
when it comes to my little girl.

16:10.012 --> 16:12.056
Tell me that after you've paid it, mate.

16:13.891 --> 16:16.269
Yeah. You're gonna be a huge help.

16:38.291 --> 16:41.961
Come on, knob-head, let's go pay a visit
to the bastard who's got your girl.

16:50.178 --> 16:51.387
You think it's a trap?

16:53.472 --> 16:54.807
- John.
- What?

16:54.891 --> 16:56.309
You think it's a trap?

16:56.392 --> 16:58.603
Chas, it's always a bloody trap.

17:05.067 --> 17:09.530
Are you sure we're the only ones
who can see that, whatever it is?

17:09.696 --> 17:11.991
The Shield of Ermed
will protect Trish's body,

17:12.366 --> 17:14.702
anchor it here while John
searches out her soul.

17:15.161 --> 17:18.164
Lost souls, mystic shields, Demons.

17:18.247 --> 17:19.665
This is...

17:19.749 --> 17:21.626
Oh, this is crazy.

17:22.792 --> 17:25.713
You people go about your lives
like sleepwalkers.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.926
You have no idea what's out there.

17:30.301 --> 17:33.346
The darkness that's hovering
on the periphery of your vision.

17:38.726 --> 17:40.311
I know more than you think.

17:41.145 --> 17:42.980
Darkness you talk about.

17:43.439 --> 17:45.483
It nearly destroyed my husband.

17:46.192 --> 17:48.694
He was with John in Newcastle.

17:48.945 --> 17:50.112
So, you know the story?

17:50.613 --> 17:51.781
Just scraps of it.

17:52.240 --> 17:54.367
Johnny boy likes to brag about his exploits.

17:54.951 --> 17:56.118
But not that one.

17:58.008 --> 18:00.748
It was years before Chas finally told me.

18:01.582 --> 18:02.875
Tell me.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.086
About Newcastle? No.

18:06.304 --> 18:08.716
I can't. I just...

18:10.132 --> 18:12.051
It wasn't a request.

18:16.722 --> 18:19.934
They were inseparable, John and Chas,

18:20.017 --> 18:22.603
<i>from the time they were kids
growing up in Liverpool.</i>

18:22.979 --> 18:25.064
<i>Looked after each other.</i>

18:25.147 --> 18:27.149
<i>God knows their families couldn't.</i>

18:27.608 --> 18:29.318
<i>Opposites, you know?</i>

18:29.402 --> 18:32.780
<i>Chas was attracted
to John's unpredictability.</i>

18:33.364 --> 18:36.659
<i>And John, he was drawn to Chas' soft heart.</i>

18:37.451 --> 18:40.579
I think it was the music
more than anything that bonded them.

18:41.163 --> 18:42.873
<i>They were obsessed.</i>

18:42.957 --> 18:44.375
<i>Had to learn to play.</i>

18:44.667 --> 18:46.043
<i>Had to form a band.</i>

18:47.878 --> 18:51.549
<i>They spent years performing in
shitholes for a percentage of the door.</i>

18:52.383 --> 18:55.136
<i>They always thought they were
a day away from fame and fortune.</i>

18:56.804 --> 19:00.599
<i>Maybe it would've worked out
if they hadn't ended up in Newcastle.</i>

19:02.351 --> 19:06.981
<i>The Casanova Club was run
by a twisted bastard named Alex Logue.</i>

19:07.481 --> 19:09.450
<i>Fancied himself a sorcerer.</i>

19:10.333 --> 19:13.495
<i>Had what he called "magical convocations"</i>

19:13.579 --> 19:16.574
<i>in the rooms under the club.
Don't ask me what that means.</i>

19:16.657 --> 19:18.075
<i>I don't wanna know.</i>

19:33.299 --> 19:36.719
<i>But I do know that Logue
used his daughter, Astra,</i>

19:36.802 --> 19:38.763
<i>as a focal point for his spells.</i>

19:39.347 --> 19:43.726
<i>A human channel to draw the dark magic
down into the physical world.</i>

19:48.314 --> 19:50.107
<i>His own child.</i>

19:52.068 --> 19:53.444
<i>Can you imagine?</i>

19:54.487 --> 19:56.072
<i>Oh, it was bad.</i>

19:58.491 --> 20:02.203
<i>And then, John Constantine
went and made it worse.</i>

20:04.872 --> 20:09.418
<i>You see, John was another one
who fancied himself a magician.</i>

20:09.502 --> 20:14.381
<i>Been studying the occult since he was
a boy, claimed he had a natural gift.</i>

20:15.883 --> 20:18.219
<i>Logue had been a mentor to him...</i>

20:18.302 --> 20:20.930
<i>...but when John found out what
was happening with the girl,</i>

20:21.764 --> 20:24.141
<i>he decided he was gonna save Astra.</i>

20:24.725 --> 20:28.771
<i>He could've just called the cops,
but that would've been too easy.</i>

20:29.254 --> 20:31.107
<i>And of course Chas,</i>

20:31.190 --> 20:33.901
<i>the loyal idiot, was right there with him.</i>

20:33.984 --> 20:37.571
<i>And what better way to stop
a devil like Alex Logue</i>

20:37.655 --> 20:39.323
<i>than by summoning a bigger one.</i>

20:56.841 --> 20:58.134
<i>A real one.</i>

21:02.430 --> 21:04.140
<i>That was John's logic.</i>

21:04.765 --> 21:07.685
<i>And it worked, up to a point.</i>

21:51.520 --> 21:55.441
<i>John thought he could use Nergal to put
the fear into Logue and his friends,</i>

21:56.150 --> 21:57.902
<i>and get Astra away from them.</i>

21:58.402 --> 22:00.446
<i>But he was arrogant even then.</i>

22:02.907 --> 22:06.243
<i>Our John didn't know half
of what he thought he did.</i>

22:08.829 --> 22:11.665
<i>So, he never wove a binding
spell around the demon,</i>

22:12.291 --> 22:15.010
<i>which means he couldn't control it.</i>

22:15.393 --> 22:17.505
<i>Couldn't stop Nergal...</i>

22:26.138 --> 22:28.832
<i>...from unleashing hell on Earth.</i>

22:48.619 --> 22:51.080
<i>Some got out, some didn't,</i>

22:51.163 --> 22:53.050
<i>and John...</i>

22:54.333 --> 22:57.795
<i>Well, he learned that night
that his natural gift...</i>

22:59.630 --> 23:01.340
<i>Wasn't gift enough.</i>

23:11.267 --> 23:12.685
No!

23:21.527 --> 23:22.778
No!

23:37.876 --> 23:40.963
<i>And that's how John ended up in Ravenscar.</i>

23:45.718 --> 23:49.096
<i>And my Chas just
soldiered on all those years.</i>

23:49.179 --> 23:50.306
No! No!

23:50.389 --> 23:53.059
<i>Pretending everything was all right.</i>

23:54.143 --> 23:55.853
<i>I believed him, too.</i>

23:57.146 --> 24:01.817
<i>But once you've been through
something like that, it never can be.</i>

24:11.493 --> 24:12.703
Can it?

24:21.712 --> 24:23.130
About Newcastle?

24:23.213 --> 24:25.007
No, I can't.

24:26.342 --> 24:27.384
We're just...

24:27.801 --> 24:29.470
That's all right.

24:29.553 --> 24:32.139
If you don't wanna tell me,
you don't have to.

24:43.067 --> 24:44.777
You could've sprung for
something bigger, John.

24:45.653 --> 24:47.821
I feel like I'm in a bloody clown car.

24:48.197 --> 24:50.491
I didn't see you reaching
into your pocket to help.

24:53.911 --> 24:54.953
How's that for you?

25:08.509 --> 25:09.843
Weird.

25:09.927 --> 25:11.845
- What?
- Don't know.

25:12.137 --> 25:14.932
Maybe it's the jet lag
or maybe it's this city.

25:15.391 --> 25:16.809
I'm used to London.

25:17.393 --> 25:19.937
I know her. Down to every alley.

25:20.020 --> 25:22.898
Every shadowed corner of her soul.

25:22.981 --> 25:24.358
But this place...

25:27.403 --> 25:28.696
Too much light.

25:28.779 --> 25:30.572
I could use a bit of light right now.

25:30.656 --> 25:32.741
Well, you soak it in, mate.

25:32.825 --> 25:34.910
Me, I don't trust it.

25:40.916 --> 25:44.086
This is it. 1247 Enstrom.

25:46.922 --> 25:48.924
- You one for anagrams, Chas?
- No.

25:49.466 --> 25:50.634
Why?

25:52.177 --> 25:56.348
Enstrom. Move the letters around,
and what have you got?

25:57.015 --> 25:58.142
Monster.

25:59.601 --> 26:00.602
It's funny, eh?

26:00.728 --> 26:01.729
Yeah.

26:01.812 --> 26:02.896
I'm in hysterics.

26:09.903 --> 26:10.988
Yes.

26:11.071 --> 26:12.364
Clearly the right place.

26:12.531 --> 26:14.074
I think we're expected.

26:15.367 --> 26:18.579
Enter freely and of your own free will.

26:20.080 --> 26:22.541
I've always wanted to say that.

26:43.498 --> 26:44.671
Oi!

26:44.813 --> 26:46.857
Master Beroul will be down presently.

26:47.149 --> 26:48.525
Please wait right here.

26:56.825 --> 26:57.826
Bollocks!

26:58.368 --> 27:00.370
Oi! He said to wait here.

27:00.621 --> 27:03.207
Yeah. And that's just what I want you to do.

27:22.935 --> 27:25.354
I rather like the smell.

27:26.396 --> 27:28.482
Master Beroul, I presume.

27:28.732 --> 27:31.026
Beroul will suffice.

27:31.151 --> 27:33.570
Oh. The pool's not ready yet.

27:34.238 --> 27:37.699
I've got to wait for the bodies to liquefy,

27:37.783 --> 27:40.035
dredge out the bones.

27:40.118 --> 27:41.119
And then?

27:41.203 --> 27:44.373
Use it for my daily swim, of course.

27:44.456 --> 27:46.708
Ugh. Lovely.

27:46.792 --> 27:51.922
Isn't it, though?
A man needs to stay in shape.

27:52.631 --> 27:54.633
Uh, you're no bloody man.

27:55.968 --> 28:01.139
Something you'd do well
to remember, Mr. Constantine.

28:02.099 --> 28:03.100
You know me.

28:03.475 --> 28:06.570
Your reputation precedes you.

28:08.021 --> 28:13.485
Why else would I go
to all this trouble to bring you here?

28:13.569 --> 28:15.946
Ah, you used Trish as a lure.

28:17.025 --> 28:19.658
Mr. Chandler is one of the few people

28:19.741 --> 28:21.827
on this Earth you care about.

28:22.369 --> 28:26.707
I knew you wouldn't refuse
your old friend's plea for help.

28:27.124 --> 28:28.750
You could've just texted me.

28:29.126 --> 28:31.462
And would you have come?

28:32.045 --> 28:34.089
A man of your nature, John,

28:34.172 --> 28:38.135
requires something more theatrical, hmm?

28:38.552 --> 28:40.554
More dangerous.

28:43.307 --> 28:44.725
What's this all about?

28:44.808 --> 28:47.227
I'll explain everything.

28:47.394 --> 28:49.897
At the party.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.008
No!

30:30.205 --> 30:33.125
I adore old Hollywood, don't you?

30:37.045 --> 30:41.091
Of course, if you don't like the 1920s,

30:41.174 --> 30:45.178
something a bit more contemporary, perhaps.

30:51.643 --> 30:54.396
You're gonna die. You're gonna die.

31:13.623 --> 31:14.750
Dance.

31:16.334 --> 31:18.462
Uh... I don't think so.

31:18.795 --> 31:22.424
Out in the world,
beyond my wards and enchantments,

31:22.507 --> 31:25.635
you may be able to resist me.

31:25.719 --> 31:29.097
But here, in my house...

31:33.560 --> 31:36.438
- Is this Hell?
- A hell.

31:37.564 --> 31:39.649
My hell.

31:39.733 --> 31:43.445
You see, I've been visiting
Los Angeles for years.

31:43.612 --> 31:45.947
Felt right at home, instantly.

31:46.031 --> 31:48.909
After all, everybody in this town

31:48.992 --> 31:51.536
sells their soul for a dream.

31:56.750 --> 31:59.503
People here are so desperate,

31:59.586 --> 32:02.130
so enamored of illusion.

32:02.214 --> 32:06.301
Oh, yes. They'll very happily
debase themselves

32:06.384 --> 32:09.846
for the merest whisper of fame.

32:09.930 --> 32:14.476
Down there, you know, we've got
to wait for the damned to descend,

32:14.810 --> 32:17.729
fight among ourselves for the pickings.

32:17.938 --> 32:22.359
But up here, mmm? So many souls.

32:22.526 --> 32:25.987
It's a cast of thousands, millions.

32:26.238 --> 32:30.951
Power-hungry, delusional,
egotistical, selfish.

32:31.076 --> 32:36.248
All the qualities we look for
in candidates for damnation.

32:36.331 --> 32:40.085
I had what you Brits would call a brainwave.

32:40.377 --> 32:43.463
A branch office of Hell, right here.

32:43.630 --> 32:47.259
A franchise operation, like fast food,

32:47.342 --> 32:51.263
but with the added benefit
of eternal damnation.

32:51.596 --> 32:56.893
So many souls just begging
to be corrupted and consumed.

32:57.698 --> 33:01.189
So much power for a demon to absorb.

33:01.273 --> 33:03.024
The sky is the limit

33:03.108 --> 33:06.486
for the entrepreneur who gets in first.

33:10.323 --> 33:12.951
But I've got competition.

33:13.201 --> 33:16.997
Five other Demons with similar aspirations.

33:17.330 --> 33:21.293
And I want that competition eliminated.

33:21.376 --> 33:24.212
- And that's where I come in.
- Precisely.

33:27.048 --> 33:29.009
I don't do anything till I see the girl.

33:29.843 --> 33:31.219
Which one?

33:32.137 --> 33:33.346
Chas' Trish.

33:34.472 --> 33:35.974
Ah.

33:36.558 --> 33:39.019
Nothing my kind savors more

33:39.102 --> 33:44.316
than the sweet subtle flavors
of an innocent soul.

33:44.608 --> 33:45.859
Where is she?

33:46.443 --> 33:49.858
Safe, right here.

33:50.780 --> 33:54.201
You could say she's a prisoner of love,

33:54.951 --> 33:59.539
held, quite literally, within my heart.

34:00.790 --> 34:03.376
Let her go, you bastard. Let her go.

34:03.460 --> 34:06.338
No, Chas. If what Beroul's saying is true,

34:06.421 --> 34:09.507
then any attack on him
is an attack on your daughter.

34:09.591 --> 34:11.927
But we don't know if it's true, do we?

34:14.471 --> 34:16.348
- Chas!
- Not to worry.

34:16.889 --> 34:18.183
He isn't dead.

34:19.759 --> 34:21.811
<i>Just displaced.</i>

34:25.190 --> 34:26.565
Bloody hell.

34:30.612 --> 34:33.239
Not that the idiot could've hurt me.

34:33.322 --> 34:36.618
Now, will you take the job?

34:38.536 --> 34:41.539
If I'm working for you, I want a fat salary,

34:41.623 --> 34:44.167
- and a swanky hotel.
- Done.

34:44.833 --> 34:48.797
Now get out. It's time for
<i>The Young and the Restless,</i>

34:49.089 --> 34:50.840
and I never miss it.

34:54.219 --> 34:57.889
Jeez, keep your bloody head on,
Chas. I'm coming. What?

34:58.431 --> 35:00.392
Yeah, I'm driving. So what?

35:05.730 --> 35:06.940
Piss off.

35:13.947 --> 35:16.349
I said, piss off.

35:39.931 --> 35:40.974
Took you long enough.

35:41.057 --> 35:42.851
I might've gotten lost a few times.

35:49.065 --> 35:51.276
So you're working for Beroul now.

35:52.027 --> 35:53.361
Are you crazy?

35:54.321 --> 35:55.572
Stupid question.

35:55.780 --> 35:57.365
He didn't give me much choice.

35:57.949 --> 35:59.159
We've gotta play his game

35:59.242 --> 36:00.910
if we wanna get Trish back, all right?

36:01.369 --> 36:03.621
And what do all the coma victims
have to do with this?

36:08.001 --> 36:09.586
The best I can figure,

36:09.669 --> 36:13.173
their souls are fueling
the engine of Beroul's magic,

36:13.256 --> 36:14.758
like batteries,

36:14.841 --> 36:17.844
providing the energy for him
to open up small doorways

36:17.927 --> 36:21.765
between Hell and Earth, so he can
set up his bloody franchises

36:21.848 --> 36:23.558
and feed on the souls up here.

36:23.641 --> 36:25.477
But where does Trish come into it?

36:25.935 --> 36:30.190
There are dozens of coma cases here,
but in London, there's just...

36:31.358 --> 36:32.359
Oh.

36:33.360 --> 36:34.444
Go on.

36:34.694 --> 36:36.154
Tell me it's all my fault.

36:37.572 --> 36:38.656
Maybe it is.

36:39.449 --> 36:42.243
Or maybe you can't be responsible
for every damn Demon

36:42.327 --> 36:43.870
that wants to make trouble in this world.

36:45.705 --> 36:48.291
Only thing I know is I want my little girl,

36:49.376 --> 36:51.419
and if anyone can get her back, it's you.

36:51.503 --> 36:53.088
Tell that to Astra Logue.

36:55.799 --> 36:57.759
You were a stupid, arrogant kid then.

36:58.134 --> 37:01.596
Yeah? And I'm a stupid, arrogant man now.

37:02.305 --> 37:04.474
But I'll do the best I can for you, Chas.

37:04.974 --> 37:06.393
You've got my word on that.

37:08.269 --> 37:10.063
Good. So what's next?

37:10.313 --> 37:13.233
Next? We follow Mr. Blobby's orders,

37:13.316 --> 37:16.427
kill his enemies and kiss his fat...

37:23.993 --> 37:25.194
Shit!

37:45.265 --> 37:47.851
Where'd they come from? Who sent them?

37:47.934 --> 37:51.980
One of Beroul's competitors, no doubt,
who wants to stop me before I stop them.

37:52.313 --> 37:55.442
Well, can't you just,
I don't know, magic them away?

37:55.525 --> 37:56.818
Who the hell do you think I am?

37:56.901 --> 37:58.528
Benedict bloody Cumberbatch?

37:58.736 --> 38:00.405
Well, do something!

38:07.203 --> 38:08.246
John!

38:18.131 --> 38:19.382
Hit the brakes.

39:32.956 --> 39:34.707
Now that's a border wall.

39:34.791 --> 39:37.043
Yeah, well, the enchantment's not gonna last.

39:37.252 --> 39:40.255
We've got less than a minute before
those things start eating our livers.

39:41.047 --> 39:45.843
You know, for a guy who lies so much,
you tell the truth at the worst bloody times.

40:01.651 --> 40:03.528
- Get in.
- Really?

40:03.611 --> 40:05.780
And I'm supposed to trust you because...

40:05.905 --> 40:07.407
Because if you don't, you're gonna die.

40:07.490 --> 40:08.658
Now get in the car, John.

40:19.085 --> 40:21.504
- Who the hell are you?
- A friend.

40:21.588 --> 40:23.423
And how do you know my bloody name?

40:23.923 --> 40:26.926
Look, maneuvering the vehicle while
controlling this body isn't easy for me.

40:28.636 --> 40:30.471
- Clearly.
- So, shut the hell up

40:30.555 --> 40:32.140
and let me concentrate on my driving.

40:47.572 --> 40:48.740
What's this?

40:49.449 --> 40:50.575
Didn't I tell you?

40:51.451 --> 40:52.827
We've moved up in the world.

40:54.037 --> 40:55.121
You coming?

40:55.705 --> 40:57.081
I'll be in touch.

41:02.629 --> 41:04.213
Where the hell am I?

41:12.847 --> 41:14.307
You think that was Beroul's work?

41:14.515 --> 41:16.726
If he could do that, he wouldn't need me.

41:17.977 --> 41:18.978
Then who?

41:19.395 --> 41:22.857
Well, whoever it was, they
just saved our skins.

41:25.401 --> 41:27.320
What the hell are those things?

41:27.862 --> 41:29.697
Spirits from the lower astral plane.

41:30.073 --> 41:33.368
They're so hungry for life on Earth,
they can't move on to the deeper heavens.

41:34.118 --> 41:35.411
What do they want with her?

41:36.204 --> 41:37.413
Trish's soul isn't here.

41:37.497 --> 41:39.165
So she's a perfect vehicle for them.

41:39.374 --> 41:40.667
A way back.

41:41.125 --> 41:42.877
No. No!

41:43.127 --> 41:44.753
Don't worry.

41:46.381 --> 41:47.507
They can't get to her.

41:48.549 --> 41:49.550
Yet.

41:51.594 --> 41:53.262
What do you mean, "yet"?

41:54.907 --> 41:57.183
The longer her soul's away from her body,

41:58.017 --> 42:00.228
the harder it's going to be
for me to protect her.

42:01.062 --> 42:02.605
Oh, God.

42:02.897 --> 42:05.191
I wish Chas was here.

42:07.360 --> 42:08.444
You still love him?

42:10.530 --> 42:12.657
Once you've shared your life with someone,

42:12.740 --> 42:14.575
created a child together,

42:16.994 --> 42:19.038
opened your heart so wide,

42:20.081 --> 42:21.374
that love never leaves,

42:22.333 --> 42:24.127
no matter how much you might want it to.

42:24.877 --> 42:26.337
And Trish...

42:26.421 --> 42:29.674
Oh, God. She adores that man.

42:32.091 --> 42:33.978
Girls and their dads, you know?

42:34.679 --> 42:36.055
Actually, I don't.

42:36.180 --> 42:39.600
I understand the pleasures
of this human flesh well enough.

42:39.934 --> 42:41.728
But the kind of love you're talking about,

42:44.856 --> 42:46.232
it's a mystery to me.

42:54.115 --> 42:56.659
I'm disappointed in you, John.

42:59.662 --> 43:02.874
Two days and you haven't made any progress.

43:03.499 --> 43:06.210
My enemies are still out there.

43:06.294 --> 43:08.379
Well, it's not like you gave me an address.

43:08.921 --> 43:11.924
I've had to follow the ley lines,
see where they converge in places

43:12.008 --> 43:14.635
that will be conducive to your kind.

43:16.262 --> 43:19.390
Or are you just marking time

43:19.474 --> 43:21.184
while you plot against me?

43:21.267 --> 43:23.352
I'm getting close, Beroul.

43:23.853 --> 43:25.688
Get closer.

43:27.982 --> 43:30.985
The meter's running on the girl, you know.

43:31.068 --> 43:33.029
Progressive neuropathy.

43:33.446 --> 43:36.491
The sooner you get poor Trish
back into her own body,

43:36.866 --> 43:39.744
the more of it she'll still be able to use.

43:42.789 --> 43:44.791
How do I know that you really have her, eh?

43:45.374 --> 43:46.751
Her soul could be anywhere.

43:47.001 --> 43:50.963
Oh, I suppose I can give you
a little glimpse.

43:51.631 --> 43:55.051
Perhaps the motivation will speed you along.

44:03.476 --> 44:04.644
Shit.

44:10.399 --> 44:11.400
Trish?

44:12.693 --> 44:13.736
Trish, is that you?

44:14.111 --> 44:16.739
Don't hurt me. Don't hurt me.

44:19.408 --> 44:20.409
Help her!

44:30.044 --> 44:34.215
John, there's just so long I can keep
her body alive while her soul is...

44:36.592 --> 44:37.927
Wherever the hell this is.

44:38.344 --> 44:40.638
You don't want to know. You need...

44:40.805 --> 44:42.682
<i>Time's up.</i>

44:50.606 --> 44:53.651
Trish. Trish, I swear I'll get you out.

44:54.151 --> 44:56.904
I swear I will get you out!

45:06.070 --> 45:08.170
Believe me now?

45:08.251 --> 45:10.543
Aw, feeling queasy?

45:10.793 --> 45:14.839
I thought you had the stomach
for this kind of thing, John.

45:14.922 --> 45:16.465
Yeah. Piss off.

45:18.467 --> 45:21.888
I thought you'd changed since Newcastle.

45:23.639 --> 45:27.768
Oh, the look on your face
when I opened that portal

45:27.852 --> 45:30.229
and tossed little Astra in.

45:31.022 --> 45:33.941
Even tainted by her father,

45:34.025 --> 45:39.030
there was still
so much innocence left in her.

45:41.207 --> 45:42.909
Delicious.

45:44.327 --> 45:45.661
No.

45:46.120 --> 45:47.455
Yes.

45:55.922 --> 45:57.298
Nergal.

45:58.507 --> 46:00.760
But Beroul?

46:01.344 --> 46:04.013
Was a convenient mask.

46:04.430 --> 46:06.807
I told you back in London

46:06.891 --> 46:09.101
that I had many names.

46:12.188 --> 46:16.859
I've been keeping tabs on you
since Newcastle, John.

46:17.735 --> 46:21.822
Watched you claw your way back
from the edge of sanity.

46:22.740 --> 46:25.034
Watched you master the very dark arts

46:25.117 --> 46:28.579
that failed you 15 years ago.

46:29.121 --> 46:30.957
You really should thank me.

46:31.040 --> 46:32.667
Thank you?

46:32.750 --> 46:36.963
After all, I did inspire you
to become a better man,

46:37.046 --> 46:38.047
didn't I?

46:39.131 --> 46:40.967
And now, here we are,

46:41.342 --> 46:45.012
reunited after all this time.

46:45.513 --> 46:46.597
Bastard.

46:47.848 --> 46:49.183
Uh-uh-uh.

46:50.101 --> 46:52.436
Wouldn't want to hurt poor Trish.

46:54.689 --> 46:55.856
Why are you doing this?

46:55.982 --> 46:59.402
Because you've got so much potential, John.

47:00.194 --> 47:02.905
And I'd like to help you actualize it.

47:02.989 --> 47:06.200
You see, I have minor limitations

47:06.283 --> 47:07.785
while I'm in this world.

47:08.744 --> 47:12.081
I need a human agent with your skill set

47:12.164 --> 47:16.377
who can travel freely,
seek out new customers,

47:16.460 --> 47:18.379
help build up the business.

47:18.462 --> 47:21.549
Think of all we can accomplish together.

47:22.591 --> 47:25.011
I do this one thing for you, Nergal.

47:25.094 --> 47:29.724
You give me Trish and then you never
see me again, you understand?

47:29.807 --> 47:33.144
I understand if you need to take some time

47:33.227 --> 47:34.478
to think about it.

47:34.562 --> 47:36.772
Now, get out of my house.

47:37.189 --> 47:38.816
And one more thing.

47:38.983 --> 47:41.152
What happened to Astra?

47:41.652 --> 47:44.155
She's somewhere in the bowels of Hell,

47:45.215 --> 47:46.991
screaming your name.

47:47.533 --> 47:51.287
Now, get out and do your damn job.

47:54.206 --> 47:55.750
Oh, and, John,

47:56.292 --> 48:00.337
if your whore in London tries
to get inside me again,

48:00.713 --> 48:02.256
it won't end well

48:02.631 --> 48:05.468
for her or Trish.

48:09.138 --> 48:11.140
I'm getting closer to finding them, Chas.

48:11.515 --> 48:14.310
Demons like those five
leave a psychic residue

48:14.393 --> 48:16.353
like a slug leaves a trail of slime.

48:16.437 --> 48:17.938
So just hang in there, all right?

48:19.440 --> 48:21.233
No, you don't have to come out.

48:24.904 --> 48:26.363
Take the night to yourself.

48:26.447 --> 48:28.157
Have a drink and get some..

48:31.202 --> 48:32.411
In there.

48:39.293 --> 48:40.544
What are you looking at?

49:08.781 --> 49:10.324
Hey, jerkoff.

49:37.768 --> 49:39.395
Not your usual,

49:41.856 --> 49:43.232
but I hope it will do.

49:44.275 --> 49:46.902
Nice to see you again, John.

49:47.027 --> 49:48.028
Again?

50:01.917 --> 50:04.420
All of it. All of them.

50:06.088 --> 50:07.965
Some call me Angela.

50:08.632 --> 50:10.509
Others call me...

50:15.556 --> 50:18.809
Queen of Angels.

50:18.893 --> 50:20.060
You.

50:22.104 --> 50:23.105
Coming?

50:23.772 --> 50:24.857
Where?

50:25.608 --> 50:27.484
Afraid of me, John?

50:27.568 --> 50:29.195
Do you think I'm one of them?

50:29.612 --> 50:32.615
- A devil from Hell?
- Maybe.

50:32.698 --> 50:34.366
Come with me and you'll see

50:34.450 --> 50:37.369
that I am so much more.

50:47.296 --> 50:48.422
What is this?

50:48.714 --> 50:50.799
A history lesson.

50:54.053 --> 50:56.430
You said you know London, John.

50:56.722 --> 50:58.390
Every alley,

50:58.474 --> 51:01.644
every shadowed corner of her soul.

51:01.977 --> 51:05.064
Now step out into the sun

51:05.189 --> 51:07.483
and know me.

51:13.697 --> 51:17.618
My body is flesh and blood,

51:17.701 --> 51:20.246
stone and concrete,

51:20.329 --> 51:22.081
tree and earth.

51:22.498 --> 51:24.500
My mind is thick

51:24.583 --> 51:28.170
with 10 times 10 million memories.

51:28.254 --> 51:33.092
<i>Radiant, like the histories of all my people.</i>

51:36.095 --> 51:39.390
You're the collective
consciousness of the city.

51:40.933 --> 51:42.768
You're Los Angeles.

51:43.060 --> 51:45.521
Queen of Angels.

51:47.022 --> 51:49.608
From the very beginning, John,

51:49.692 --> 51:52.528
men and women have come to me

51:53.028 --> 51:55.030
seeking second chances,

51:56.657 --> 51:59.451
hoping to remake,

51:59.535 --> 52:02.746
rebirth themselves in my light.

52:03.580 --> 52:05.582
I'm not perfect, John.

52:07.209 --> 52:09.837
There have been times I've failed my people.

52:10.546 --> 52:12.256
Failed them badly.

52:13.507 --> 52:15.634
But for all my flaws,

52:15.968 --> 52:17.928
for all my failures,

52:18.345 --> 52:20.597
this is a city of hope.

52:21.015 --> 52:23.142
The city of angels.

52:24.226 --> 52:28.022
And I won't have
those hell things poisoning it.

52:28.480 --> 52:30.382
Poisoning me.

52:32.735 --> 52:36.488
It was you back in London,
poking around in my head.

52:42.870 --> 52:45.998
Rooting through the darkness of your psyche.

52:46.332 --> 52:49.335
<i>Calling out the little monsters
that live inside you.</i>

52:49.835 --> 52:52.338
- Why?
- I had to be sure of you.

52:53.047 --> 52:54.465
You see, John,

52:55.215 --> 52:58.886
I need your demons to fight these Demons.

53:00.596 --> 53:02.181
We all use each other.

53:04.725 --> 53:07.353
You know that better than anyone.

53:16.403 --> 53:17.613
Shit.

53:29.375 --> 53:31.585
How can you sit there
checking your bloody e-mail

53:31.668 --> 53:33.712
when my girl's life is on the line?

53:34.004 --> 53:36.173
When that bastard Nergal has her.

53:36.673 --> 53:38.842
I'm not checking e-mails, knob-head.

53:38.926 --> 53:40.761
I'm doing research.

53:40.844 --> 53:44.056
I haven't got the power
to take on Nergal's competitors.

53:44.515 --> 53:46.725
I need a weapon to use against them.

53:47.142 --> 53:49.144
I don't think you're gonna
find that on Amazon.

53:49.311 --> 53:53.023
I've been poking around the ethers,
pulling down bits of information.

53:53.732 --> 53:55.901
- About what?
- Not what.

53:57.653 --> 54:00.030
Who. Mictlantecuhtli.

54:00.447 --> 54:02.825
Ancient Aztec death god.

54:02.908 --> 54:04.076
One of the big boys.

54:23.637 --> 54:25.722
Aztec empire died out.

54:26.098 --> 54:28.600
And Mictlantecuhtli
should have died with them.

54:28.892 --> 54:32.396
But the faith persisted and Spanish
settlers brought him with them

54:32.521 --> 54:33.981
to Southern California.

54:35.023 --> 54:36.984
New gods rose and fell,

54:37.067 --> 54:39.194
but Mictlantecuhtli is a stubborn bastard

54:39.361 --> 54:41.530
and he just keeps hanging on.

54:41.989 --> 54:45.117
That's... That's not real, is it?

54:45.492 --> 54:48.996
I gave up on trying to figure out
what's real a long time ago.

54:49.371 --> 54:51.748
Not a helpful answer.

55:01.175 --> 55:03.302
And what's this Mict... Mictl...

55:03.886 --> 55:06.472
What's this bloody god
got to do with my Trish?

55:07.181 --> 55:08.390
Let's find out.

55:27.326 --> 55:28.327
Lovely.

55:34.750 --> 55:37.878
Mictlantecuhtli, god of bones
and of the grave mouth

55:37.961 --> 55:40.547
and of all that begins when the heart stops,

55:41.131 --> 55:43.217
I come to you as a suppliant.

55:51.391 --> 55:54.561
I spill my own blood now to show respect.

55:55.229 --> 55:57.564
Thank you for letting me into your house.

55:58.023 --> 56:00.359
Thank you for hearing...

56:19.378 --> 56:22.130
How did you find me?

56:25.467 --> 56:28.303
How did you find me?

56:28.387 --> 56:30.055
You're not like the others.

56:30.389 --> 56:32.015
You're not trying to hide.

56:32.099 --> 56:34.226
You want your worshippers to find you.

56:34.476 --> 56:36.603
One day, yes,

56:36.687 --> 56:39.231
when I'm strong again.

56:39.773 --> 56:43.151
Once I was worshiped by millions,

56:43.235 --> 56:47.781
and they sacrificed millions more in my name.

56:47.906 --> 56:50.576
Now, to my eternal shame,

56:50.659 --> 56:54.538
I am reduced to feeding
on the energy of the animals

56:54.621 --> 56:58.125
that die every day above my head.

57:00.294 --> 57:02.754
But I still have power

57:04.214 --> 57:08.135
and I am still a threat to someone like you.

57:08.218 --> 57:11.013
What prevents me from feeding on you,

57:11.096 --> 57:12.931
John Constantine?

57:13.098 --> 57:15.475
Sucking out your meaningless life

57:15.559 --> 57:18.020
and feasting on your soul?

57:19.605 --> 57:23.859
Don't gobble me up
until you've heard my offer.

57:25.319 --> 57:27.195
I am listening.

57:35.037 --> 57:36.496
Jesus, John.

57:36.955 --> 57:38.874
You're white as a sheet. Are you all right?

57:38.957 --> 57:42.878
No, but I'm alive and that's gotta
count for something, right?

57:43.795 --> 57:45.672
Now, I've got an errand for you to do.

57:46.006 --> 57:48.050
- It's important, Chas.
- Done.

57:48.550 --> 57:49.635
And you?

57:50.052 --> 57:53.347
I've got a phone call to make, of sorts.

58:12.115 --> 58:13.700
A church, Johnny?

58:14.117 --> 58:16.578
- Really?
- Unconsecrated.

58:16.995 --> 58:19.748
Otherwise, I'd have a hard time
setting foot in there.

58:21.041 --> 58:22.734
And so would they.

58:33.011 --> 58:36.431
- Oi, careful.
- This shit's heavy. Christ.

58:36.848 --> 58:39.226
Who knew there was
a black market in Holy Water.

58:39.309 --> 58:41.061
Just don't drop it, all right?

58:41.520 --> 58:44.523
Don't want you splashing it around
till dead-on midnight.

58:44.815 --> 58:47.609
And make sure all the windows
are locked before you leave.

58:48.610 --> 58:51.363
Cover every way out of this place.

59:06.044 --> 59:07.921
What's that bloody smell?

59:09.089 --> 59:10.632
Smells like shit.

59:16.638 --> 59:20.726
Is this the thing that invited us?

59:20.809 --> 59:22.519
Yep. That would be me.

59:23.979 --> 59:26.648
Can it make good on its promise?

59:30.777 --> 59:34.197
Does it think that this place can protect it

59:34.322 --> 59:37.117
if it disappoints us?

59:38.869 --> 59:40.579
It's got a name.

59:40.662 --> 59:42.831
Have you done as you promised

59:42.914 --> 59:46.877
when you summoned us here, John Constantine?

59:47.294 --> 59:50.046
Have you delivered Nergal to us?

59:50.130 --> 59:51.548
Oh, that.

59:51.631 --> 59:52.924
That was a lie.

01:00:04.561 --> 01:00:06.146
You lied to us?

01:00:08.190 --> 01:00:10.066
And I feel terrible about it.

01:00:10.984 --> 01:00:13.361
Then what shall save you,

01:00:13.445 --> 01:00:16.323
little smear of flesh?

01:00:16.406 --> 01:00:18.825
I was hoping that he would.

01:00:20.952 --> 01:00:24.539
You promised me a feast, Constantine.

01:00:24.623 --> 01:00:27.334
And you have delivered.

01:00:27.459 --> 01:00:30.504
What is this ridiculous thing?

01:00:30.962 --> 01:00:35.884
You five seek to usurp a land
that's rightfully mine.

01:00:36.343 --> 01:00:38.345
I will stop you.

01:00:38.428 --> 01:00:42.390
Consume you, body and soul.

01:00:45.977 --> 01:00:48.688
I am more than a match for you.

01:01:18.343 --> 01:01:21.562
Trapped. We are trapped!

01:01:24.850 --> 01:01:28.436
I could have never found
these five on my own.

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:32.148
Never held them here without your magics.

01:01:32.607 --> 01:01:34.150
We live to serve.

01:01:34.234 --> 01:01:35.819
Now, what are you waiting for?

01:01:35.902 --> 01:01:37.529
Finish your dinner.

01:01:43.410 --> 01:01:47.163
We are not dead yet.

01:02:07.017 --> 01:02:08.560
Going somewhere?

01:02:47.682 --> 01:02:53.438
They were more worthy
adversaries than I expected.

01:02:53.897 --> 01:02:56.024
Exactly what I was counting on.

01:02:56.107 --> 01:02:58.610
I can't let you live, Mictlantecuhtli.

01:02:58.693 --> 01:03:04.366
- You're too bloody dangerous.
- We had an agreement.

01:03:04.491 --> 01:03:07.827
And it's been fulfilled.
You got to fatten yourself up.

01:03:07.911 --> 01:03:09.579
I've got five dead Demons.

01:03:09.871 --> 01:03:12.040
Not my fault if they took you down with them.

01:03:12.123 --> 01:03:16.086
Please, Constantine, carry me back

01:03:16.169 --> 01:03:18.046
to the slaughterhouse,

01:03:18.129 --> 01:03:20.715
where I can renew myself.

01:03:21.216 --> 01:03:22.968
- Where...
- There's nothing more pathetic

01:03:23.051 --> 01:03:24.511
than a god who begs.

01:03:44.489 --> 01:03:46.491
Enjoy the rest, old man.

01:03:49.619 --> 01:03:51.287
God knows, you could use it.

01:03:59.254 --> 01:04:00.547
It's done, Nergal.

01:04:02.966 --> 01:04:06.094
All of them wiped out in one fell swoop.

01:04:08.096 --> 01:04:10.348
Well played, Constantine.

01:04:10.432 --> 01:04:11.558
Well played.

01:04:12.142 --> 01:04:13.476
Indeed, John.

01:04:16.604 --> 01:04:18.481
Very well played.

01:04:18.898 --> 01:04:21.568
You two, together.

01:04:22.068 --> 01:04:25.280
Nergal has been visiting me for a long time.

01:04:25.363 --> 01:04:29.325
We're old, well,
friends certainly isn't the word.

01:04:29.409 --> 01:04:31.661
Reluctant acquaintances.

01:04:31.745 --> 01:04:34.289
But you told me you wanted them all gone.

01:04:34.873 --> 01:04:37.208
Five is victory enough.

01:04:37.625 --> 01:04:42.130
Nergal, I'm afraid, would put up
a fight that could destroy my city.

01:04:42.505 --> 01:04:44.090
And I can't have that.

01:04:44.174 --> 01:04:45.800
So we've made

01:04:46.342 --> 01:04:47.635
an arrangement.

01:04:47.719 --> 01:04:51.056
He stays and runs his little franchise.

01:04:51.139 --> 01:04:54.601
But limits his activity
to an acceptable level.

01:04:54.809 --> 01:04:58.063
There's no acceptable level
where that's concerned.

01:04:58.146 --> 01:05:00.982
Some will suffer at Nergal's hands.

01:05:01.066 --> 01:05:02.776
Most will not.

01:05:02.859 --> 01:05:06.738
- The city will survive.
- And you can live with that, can you?

01:05:07.363 --> 01:05:09.741
We all make compromises, John.

01:05:10.283 --> 01:05:12.410
And we all have to live with them.

01:05:12.494 --> 01:05:14.746
But my kid! What about Trish?

01:05:15.288 --> 01:05:17.999
You have no idea how sorry I am.

01:05:18.666 --> 01:05:22.879
But one life measured
against the lives of millions.

01:05:25.507 --> 01:05:26.633
Damn it.

01:05:28.259 --> 01:05:29.636
God damn it.

01:05:34.516 --> 01:05:36.544
She's still in here.

01:05:37.727 --> 01:05:40.021
And he's never gonna let her go.

01:05:47.445 --> 01:05:51.241
I was wrong before.
This is on you, John Constantine.

01:05:51.324 --> 01:05:53.559
This is all on you!

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.794
Huh.

01:06:08.633 --> 01:06:10.802
I still need you, John.

01:06:11.427 --> 01:06:13.513
To be my agent out there.

01:06:14.347 --> 01:06:19.185
Keep the franchise humming.
As long as you work for me,

01:06:19.894 --> 01:06:22.355
the girl will stay alive.

01:06:22.438 --> 01:06:24.065
In a coma.

01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:26.067
What kind of life is that?

01:06:31.322 --> 01:06:32.615
Or...

01:06:32.824 --> 01:06:35.764
I could just dispatch her to Hell.

01:06:36.911 --> 01:06:39.330
Astra could use a playmate.

01:06:39.581 --> 01:06:40.915
You bloody bastard!

01:06:40.999 --> 01:06:42.000
I'll...

01:06:44.335 --> 01:06:47.714
That's no way to talk to your employer.

01:06:47.797 --> 01:06:50.508
Now pull yourself together.

01:06:50.592 --> 01:06:54.053
We've got lots of work ahead of us.

01:07:01.603 --> 01:07:03.563
Screwed it up again, didn't you?

01:07:13.406 --> 01:07:14.866
Mrs. Chandler.

01:07:21.192 --> 01:07:23.499
- What?
- Mrs. Chandler.

01:07:24.751 --> 01:07:26.836
- I don't want to hear it.
- Renee.

01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:28.838
I don't wanna hear it.

01:07:29.047 --> 01:07:31.883
Given your daughter's lack of brain activity,

01:07:32.008 --> 01:07:33.968
you're only putting yourself
through more torture

01:07:34.052 --> 01:07:35.803
by leaving her on life support.

01:07:35.887 --> 01:07:39.766
I urge you to consider letting
Tricia's body shut down naturally,

01:07:39.849 --> 01:07:41.976
- and to somehow...
- No!

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:46.940
I think you'd better go.

01:07:48.983 --> 01:07:50.810
I can help you, Renee.

01:07:52.028 --> 01:07:54.405
- The way Constantine did?
- No.

01:07:54.739 --> 01:07:56.741
I can reduce your pain.

01:07:56.824 --> 01:07:58.910
Make this decision easier for you.

01:08:00.912 --> 01:08:03.059
Reduce my pain?

01:08:04.624 --> 01:08:06.417
You're just like him, aren't you?

01:08:07.168 --> 01:08:10.838
You think you can wave your magic wand
and make the world a better place?

01:08:10.922 --> 01:08:13.216
But all you ever do is make it worse.

01:08:30.441 --> 01:08:31.484
Hey.

01:08:32.944 --> 01:08:34.069
Another one.

01:08:35.113 --> 01:08:38.241
- Another what?
- Another anything, love.

01:08:39.158 --> 01:08:41.202
You're past your limit, time to go home.

01:08:41.286 --> 01:08:42.787
Why don't you call yourself a ride?

01:08:42.953 --> 01:08:43.955
Bugger off.

01:08:44.288 --> 01:08:47.450
Nobody tells me when I've reached my limit.

01:09:05.977 --> 01:09:09.188
Abraca-fucking-dabra.

01:09:12.133 --> 01:09:13.651
Figures.

01:09:20.658 --> 01:09:22.710
Now that's more like it.

01:09:33.129 --> 01:09:34.756
Constantine,

01:09:34.839 --> 01:09:36.131
bail's been posted, come on.

01:09:36.591 --> 01:09:39.886
You tell Nergal I don't want his damn bail.

01:09:40.178 --> 01:09:42.055
I'm happy right where I am.

01:09:42.889 --> 01:09:44.057
Don't care.

01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:45.767
Name was Chandler.

01:09:48.435 --> 01:09:50.897
You're the last person I expected to see.

01:09:50.979 --> 01:09:54.108
Then we're even, 'cause
this is the last place I expected to be.

01:09:54.525 --> 01:09:55.943
How'd you know where to find me?

01:09:56.027 --> 01:09:58.613
I've watched you do this
a dozen times over the years.

01:09:58.946 --> 01:10:01.491
Things go balls up
and you're out getting pissed.

01:10:01.574 --> 01:10:03.618
Picking fights with the wrong people.

01:10:04.369 --> 01:10:06.037
You got a better idea?

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:09.582
Yeah, get up off your lazy ass
and save my girl.

01:10:10.083 --> 01:10:11.709
We lost, Chas.

01:10:11.793 --> 01:10:15.588
Nergal's gonna hold on to Trish
till her body dies and maybe...

01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:17.882
Maybe after that too.

01:10:18.716 --> 01:10:20.468
Go home, be with your wife.

01:10:20.551 --> 01:10:22.095
Beg her to take you back.

01:10:22.345 --> 01:10:25.223
- Maybe something good can come of this.
- No!

01:10:25.765 --> 01:10:28.851
You're not gonna do to her
what you did to Astra bloody Logue.

01:10:29.227 --> 01:10:32.188
Now come on, we've wasted enough time.

01:10:32.855 --> 01:10:35.358
Hey, we're not going anywhere.

01:10:36.692 --> 01:10:38.319
Not till we have a plan.

01:10:40.863 --> 01:10:41.864
Excuse me.

01:10:42.532 --> 01:10:43.616
Where are you going?

01:10:44.075 --> 01:10:45.618
Visiting hours were over at...

01:10:45.701 --> 01:10:47.578
Don't you worry about it, love.

01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:52.667
Uh, I won't.

01:11:11.519 --> 01:11:13.062
Wait outside, Chas.

01:11:13.146 --> 01:11:14.939
Anyone tries to get in, deck 'em.

01:11:15.523 --> 01:11:16.691
Deck 'em?

01:11:17.024 --> 01:11:19.193
Believe me, you'll be doing 'em a favor.

01:12:47.865 --> 01:12:49.617
Voodoo chant.

01:12:50.993 --> 01:12:52.954
How old-fashioned.

01:12:53.496 --> 01:12:54.705
Got you here, didn't it?

01:12:54.789 --> 01:12:57.625
You've cut me off from my supply chain.

01:12:57.708 --> 01:13:01.671
Blocked my access
to those slabs of comatose meat.

01:13:02.004 --> 01:13:03.339
Not very nice.

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:06.926
What do you want?

01:13:07.009 --> 01:13:08.594
And let's make this quick.

01:13:08.678 --> 01:13:11.055
I've got a meeting with a producer.

01:13:13.558 --> 01:13:16.435
Pitching him a fantastic project.

01:13:16.519 --> 01:13:18.187
A musical, of course.

01:13:18.271 --> 01:13:20.398
They're all the rage now.

01:13:20.606 --> 01:13:24.151
Stories about a deluded loser
from merry England

01:13:24.318 --> 01:13:29.156
who comes to la-la land
with a head stuffed full of dreams,

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:35.037
only to have those dreams devoured
by a charming tap-dancing demon.

01:13:57.852 --> 01:14:02.064
You do realize that this
is just one room in one hospital?

01:14:02.815 --> 01:14:06.277
There are hundreds more
of those sleeping beauties out there.

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:08.446
And you can't cut me off from all of them.

01:14:08.529 --> 01:14:11.574
He's not cutting you off
from your supplies, ass hat.

01:14:12.199 --> 01:14:15.036
He's cutting you off
from the wards and protections of that

01:14:15.119 --> 01:14:17.246
<i>Addams Family</i> mansion you live in.

01:14:17.330 --> 01:14:18.956
What are you up to?

01:14:33.387 --> 01:14:37.058
You opened a few doors
between Hell and Los Angeles.

01:14:37.141 --> 01:14:38.976
Johnny's opening the rest.

01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:40.186
What?

01:14:40.353 --> 01:14:42.897
Something your pal
Angela said stuck with him.

01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:45.941
How you'd take the city down
if you went to war with her.

01:14:46.025 --> 01:14:49.111
But John thinks you love
LA too much for that.

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.456
So what's it gonna be, Nergie?

01:15:00.831 --> 01:15:02.958
Bring an army of Demons up here

01:15:03.042 --> 01:15:06.003
and let them demolish your personal paradise,

01:15:06.087 --> 01:15:10.091
claim it for themselves,
or you let the girl go.

01:15:14.387 --> 01:15:15.971
I could use a little help here.

01:15:16.055 --> 01:15:18.474
Here's Johnny!

01:15:34.073 --> 01:15:36.325
All Constantine, all the time.

01:15:37.368 --> 01:15:39.662
I really should thank Angela for this.

01:15:44.250 --> 01:15:45.710
You won't do it.

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:47.962
I already have, you chump.

01:15:48.587 --> 01:15:51.549
<i>You were worried about
five competitors, right?</i>

01:15:51.966 --> 01:15:54.719
<i>Well, how about 500?</i>

01:15:55.344 --> 01:15:57.555
<i>Or 5,000?</i>

01:16:19.744 --> 01:16:22.872
All right, damn you, close the doorways.

01:16:23.205 --> 01:16:26.417
Close them and you can have the girl!

01:16:41.682 --> 01:16:44.685
Now, give me my daughter, you son of a bitch!

01:16:45.436 --> 01:16:47.146
I'm going to kill you.

01:16:47.938 --> 01:16:51.734
You wretched bag of misery and beer.

01:16:51.817 --> 01:16:54.987
And, oh, what I'm going to do

01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:58.574
to sweet, innocent little Trish...

01:16:59.451 --> 01:17:02.411
- But you said...
- I lied.

01:17:02.495 --> 01:17:03.996
And so did you.

01:17:04.079 --> 01:17:06.791
You're a talented lad.

01:17:06.874 --> 01:17:11.295
But you haven't got the power
to open the gates of Hell.

01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:17.635
Oh, a few temporary cracks here and there.

01:17:18.052 --> 01:17:20.888
A few dramatic rumbles.

01:17:21.931 --> 01:17:23.974
But you can't bluff me, John.

01:17:24.058 --> 01:17:26.769
You were terrified, I saw it.

01:17:26.852 --> 01:17:29.480
An Oscar-winning performance.

01:17:29.563 --> 01:17:30.940
Don't you think?

01:17:31.941 --> 01:17:36.362
Chas, remember what you said
about sacrificing anything for Trish?

01:17:36.487 --> 01:17:38.239
- Yes.
- Did you mean it?

01:17:38.364 --> 01:17:40.282
I'm choking here, Johnny.

01:17:40.366 --> 01:17:41.867
Did you mean it?

01:17:41.951 --> 01:17:42.993
Yes!

01:17:44.453 --> 01:17:45.830
Then God help you.

01:17:48.874 --> 01:17:50.292
<i>Asa, are you ready?</i>

01:17:52.169 --> 01:17:53.462
- Renee, get up.
- What?

01:17:53.546 --> 01:17:54.964
Get up now!

01:18:28.914 --> 01:18:30.958
What have you done?

01:18:31.542 --> 01:18:33.502
You didn't realize, did ya?

01:18:33.586 --> 01:18:38.173
That the biggest weapon we had
against you was inside of you all along.

01:18:40.968 --> 01:18:42.177
Now, Asa!

01:18:52.187 --> 01:18:54.440
But I... I don't understand.

01:18:54.690 --> 01:18:57.276
It's the Camdever curse, Nergal.

01:18:57.776 --> 01:18:59.820
That's love you feel.

01:18:59.904 --> 01:19:02.615
Renee and Trish's love for Chas,

01:19:02.698 --> 01:19:04.617
and it's all inside the girl.

01:19:04.825 --> 01:19:07.119
All inside you.

01:19:07.286 --> 01:19:09.747
And to a creature like you,

01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:11.832
that's a cancer,

01:19:11.916 --> 01:19:15.461
spreading like an LA wildfire
through every cell

01:19:15.544 --> 01:19:18.547
in that repulsive body of yours.

01:19:18.631 --> 01:19:22.801
Listen, stop this, John.
Stop it and I swear to you

01:19:22.885 --> 01:19:24.553
I'll give her back to you.

01:19:24.637 --> 01:19:27.139
We've already got her back, you twit.

01:19:27.848 --> 01:19:31.477
No, not Trish. Astra.

01:19:32.603 --> 01:19:36.440
The binding pact seared into my own flesh.

01:19:42.196 --> 01:19:44.448
Wait, I'll take you to her.

01:19:44.949 --> 01:19:47.060
Set her free.

01:19:47.743 --> 01:19:49.620
Johnny, no!

01:19:50.079 --> 01:19:52.998
Redemption, John,

01:19:53.290 --> 01:19:56.627
after all these years.

01:19:59.338 --> 01:20:00.506
Bugger off.

01:20:02.633 --> 01:20:05.427
This is redemption enough.

01:21:50.574 --> 01:21:52.367
Trish, my baby.

01:21:52.701 --> 01:21:53.869
You're back.

01:21:56.288 --> 01:21:57.748
Not bad, Con-man.

01:22:00.125 --> 01:22:01.710
Not bad at all.

01:22:09.885 --> 01:22:11.345
She's really all right.

01:22:12.429 --> 01:22:13.680
Yeah.

01:22:16.809 --> 01:22:19.603
Go ahead, blubber. I won't mock ya...

01:22:20.395 --> 01:22:22.731
- Too much.
- I better call Renee and...

01:22:24.274 --> 01:22:25.275
What?

01:22:27.903 --> 01:22:29.279
That spell I used.

01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:32.116
It was called the Camdever curse.

01:22:32.199 --> 01:22:33.200
Yeah?

01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:34.701
So?

01:22:34.785 --> 01:22:36.829
Accent on the curse, mate.

01:22:36.912 --> 01:22:38.122
What do you mean?

01:22:38.455 --> 01:22:39.706
I warned you, didn't I?

01:22:40.749 --> 01:22:43.710
Magic that powerful requires a sacrifice.

01:22:44.419 --> 01:22:47.840
Yeah, well, Nergal's
a steaming pile of demon shite,

01:22:47.923 --> 01:22:50.175
- so...
- That's not what I mean.

01:22:50.259 --> 01:22:52.761
In order for the curse to work,

01:22:52.845 --> 01:22:58.058
I had to channel Renee and Trish's
love for you into and through Nergal.

01:22:58.767 --> 01:23:00.060
Every last bit of it.

01:23:02.104 --> 01:23:03.355
It's gone, Chas.

01:23:03.856 --> 01:23:05.732
All their love for you is gone.

01:23:08.068 --> 01:23:09.069
What?

01:23:10.028 --> 01:23:12.489
Renee won't have any memory of you now.

01:23:13.157 --> 01:23:16.743
Oh, she'll recall a drunken
one-night stand eight years ago,

01:23:16.827 --> 01:23:19.997
- but your face, your name...
- What?

01:23:21.373 --> 01:23:25.294
- And Trish?
- Trish has never known her father.

01:23:27.212 --> 01:23:29.590
There's always a price to pay, Chas.

01:23:30.299 --> 01:23:32.259
And this is it.

01:23:34.219 --> 01:23:36.513
You had this in your pocket
the whole time, didn't you?

01:23:36.597 --> 01:23:37.723
I did.

01:23:38.557 --> 01:23:40.350
But I hoped I wouldn't have to use it.

01:23:40.601 --> 01:23:42.728
You miserable sack of shit!

01:23:44.688 --> 01:23:46.899
The proper response is "thank you."

01:23:46.982 --> 01:23:48.108
John!

01:23:49.276 --> 01:23:51.612
John, what?

01:23:52.696 --> 01:23:55.032
The Camdever is big magic.

01:23:55.115 --> 01:23:59.703
And Renee and Trish, no matter how much
they loved you, it wasn't enough, Chas.

01:24:01.038 --> 01:24:05.584
So, I had to throw in some extra
juice to put the spell over the top.

01:24:06.627 --> 01:24:08.337
I had to throw in us.

01:24:11.131 --> 01:24:13.550
You'll have a vague memory of an arrogant sod

01:24:13.634 --> 01:24:16.011
who saved your girl and ruined your life.

01:24:17.596 --> 01:24:20.265
But the memory
of those two kids who grew up together

01:24:20.349 --> 01:24:21.516
in the pool...

01:24:21.934 --> 01:24:23.060
Gone.

01:24:24.645 --> 01:24:26.521
Uh, sorry.

01:24:27.314 --> 01:24:28.482
Your name?

01:24:29.650 --> 01:24:32.611
- It seems to have just...
- Constantine.

01:24:33.737 --> 01:24:35.155
John Constantine.

01:24:35.530 --> 01:24:36.865
Yeah?

01:24:36.949 --> 01:24:39.284
Well, it's a name I hope I never hear again.

01:25:02.933 --> 01:25:04.893
I knew you could do it, John.

01:25:05.310 --> 01:25:06.395
Angela?

01:25:07.688 --> 01:25:09.022
More or less.

01:25:09.606 --> 01:25:11.692
You knew I'd beat Nergal.

01:25:11.775 --> 01:25:13.151
Well, I hoped.

01:25:13.568 --> 01:25:15.195
Sorry about your friend.

01:25:15.696 --> 01:25:18.699
Yeah, well, he's better off without me.

01:25:20.534 --> 01:25:22.286
Which is worse, I wonder?

01:25:22.786 --> 01:25:26.999
Being the one who doesn't remember
or being the one who does?

01:25:29.584 --> 01:25:31.837
He needs a new home, John.

01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:34.631
And I think he'll fit in nicely around here.

01:25:40.387 --> 01:25:42.806
- You take good care of him.
- I will.

01:25:45.684 --> 01:25:47.144
Ugh!

01:25:47.227 --> 01:25:49.354
Not really a fan of old and wizened.

01:25:49.438 --> 01:25:50.647
Thanks for the gesture, though.

01:25:50.897 --> 01:25:52.899
I'll see you later if you like.

01:25:52.983 --> 01:25:56.153
In a body that might
please you a little more.

01:25:56.778 --> 01:25:59.239
Mmm, a tempting offer.

01:25:59.323 --> 01:26:00.657
But no, thanks.

01:26:00.741 --> 01:26:02.242
I'm getting homesick.

01:26:02.576 --> 01:26:04.870
And if I'm gonna knock boots with a city,

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:07.247
I'd rather it was London, love.

01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:09.541
So be it.

01:26:29.686 --> 01:26:31.563
Best of luck, Chas.

01:26:31.646 --> 01:26:33.315
You're gonna need it.

01:26:40.364 --> 01:26:41.907
Oi, oi.

01:26:42.657 --> 01:26:43.909
Slow down, mate.

01:26:43.992 --> 01:26:45.327
Bloody hell.

01:26:45.786 --> 01:26:47.996
One of you actually made it out alive.

01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:49.706
It wasn't easy, I'll tell you that.

01:26:50.082 --> 01:26:51.333
Oh, it never is, mate.

01:26:52.542 --> 01:26:54.503
So, you gonna take me back in?

01:26:55.128 --> 01:26:57.547
Eventually, but right now,

01:26:57.631 --> 01:26:59.657
I could use a little company.
